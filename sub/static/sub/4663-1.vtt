(WHISTLING)

02:11.898 --> 02:15.857
Make the same. It's good for you.
Spring air.

02:16.236 --> 02:19.672
The way you're gulping it up,
there won't be enough left to go around.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.708
Isn't it very hot for so early in April,
Dr. Gurkakoff?

02:22.775 --> 02:24.140
I'm not surprised.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.202
This recent bombardment
by ions from the sun.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.408
You see, temperature is due
to the quantity of molecular...

02:30.483 --> 02:32.212
Hey, hey. Stop, stop,

02:32.285 --> 02:33.843
if you don't want me to retaliate

02:33.920 --> 02:36.946
by reciting all the tributary branches
of the Amazon.

02:37.023 --> 02:40.550
Incredible that only last week we were
drawing lots for our hot water bottle.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.824
Observe the forsythia or golden bell.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.161
I never knew it to bloom so early.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.809
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.939
It's 8:46, gentlemen.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.641
Oh, Potts.
Just once more around the park.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.740
Before we go back to our mausoleum.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.546
I saw a scarlet tanager

03:06.619 --> 03:09.918
which must have flown
all the way from Florida just to enjoy it.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.650
- 1,500 miles.
- Yes.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.591
Our constitutional
has taken up too much time already.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.185
We're working under pressure.

03:16.262 --> 03:19.527
After nine years of effort we are,
as the race track enthusiast might say,

03:19.599 --> 03:21.157
in the home stretch.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.225
Three more years
and our encyclopedia will be finished.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.567
Let's not bog down
in the middle of the letter "S."

03:25.638 --> 03:27.765
PROFESSOR: All right. All right.
That's done it.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.866
It's now 8:49, gentlemen.
I, for one, am going back to work.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.538
- Teacher's pet!
- Bertram Potts, the incorruptible.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.444
The eternal no-no man.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.504
Back home. Back home.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.108
Oh, well,
it may be raining this afternoon, anyway.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.743
(WHISTLING)

03:59.272 --> 04:01.365
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.376
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, Professor.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.309
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning.

04:06.379 --> 04:09.678
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, Professor.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.850
Gentlemen, before you get down to work,
I have got something to say.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.911
One of you made off with
a jar of strawberry preserves

04:16.990 --> 04:18.252
from my pantry last night.

04:18.324 --> 04:22.761
I located the empty jar on the shelf behind
<i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</i>

04:22.829 --> 04:26.060
That seems to indicate our historian,
Professor Peagram.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.565
I did no such thing, Miss Bragg.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.192
I'm not accusing anybody,

04:29.269 --> 04:32.761
but until it's cleared up, I think
we'll dispense with jam for breakfast.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.103
- Miss Bragg.
- Yes, Professor Oddly.

04:35.174 --> 04:36.766
I am the one.

04:36.843 --> 04:41.280
I was writing about strawberries
when suddenly I got a horrible craving.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.747
A crime confessed is half atoned.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.319
Miss Bragg. Miss Bragg.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.652
I had some material here.
What happened to it?

04:50.723 --> 04:51.815
What happened?

04:51.891 --> 04:54.359
I blushed for my duster
when I did your desk.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.453
You'll find everything
in the middle drawer, face down.

04:57.530 --> 05:01.830
I'm just starting my article on sex,
Miss Bragg. Any objections?

05:01.901 --> 05:06.031
No, I trust you have more control
of yourself than Professor Oddly.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.637
Professor Gurkakoff,
your window shade again.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.646
Yes, Miss Bragg.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.376
It's a crime
to carelessly expose this good carpet.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.941
You've just committed
a more serious crime, Miss Bragg.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.782
You have split an infinitive.

05:21.854 --> 05:25.620
Never "to carelessly expose."
Always "to expose carelessly."

05:25.692 --> 05:27.091
I'm not here to juggle words.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.890
It's my job
to conscientiously see that this house...

05:29.962 --> 05:31.896
You've just split another one, Miss Bragg.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.022
- Professor...
- Oh, oh.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.726
- Here's whatchamacallit.
- Who?

05:34.801 --> 05:37.702
The lawyer for the Foundation.
And Miss Totten's with him.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.965
And this place looking like a flicker's nest.

05:40.039 --> 05:43.941
Yes, we're in for our semi-annual wigging,
I suppose.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.705
- You'd better put your coat on, Potts.
- Why? What...

05:45.778 --> 05:48.269
- Better fix your tie.
- Fix your hair, fix your hair.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.645
Say, what is all this nonsense?

05:49.716 --> 05:52.685
GURKAKOFF: This nonsense is Miss Totten.
JEROME: And will you please smile at her?

05:52.752 --> 05:53.980
Say, this is all very undignified.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.385
- If you think you're being funny, I...
- Shh!

05:58.458 --> 06:00.756
- Morning, gentlemen.
- ALL: Good morning.

06:00.827 --> 06:03.057
Won't you sit here, Miss Totten?

06:03.129 --> 06:05.120
It's a very nice morning, Miss Totten.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.098
Would you like to speak, Miss Totten,
or shall I?

06:07.166 --> 06:08.929
You, please, Mr. Larsen.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.060
I'll make this as brief as possible,
gentlemen.

06:11.137 --> 06:16.575
To date, $283,000 have been expended
in writing this encyclopedia.

06:16.943 --> 06:20.777
You all realize that Miss Totten's father,
the late Daniel S. Totten,

06:20.847 --> 06:23.441
left only a quarter of a million dollars
for this project.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.781
Every additional penny will have to come
from Miss Totten's own pocket.

06:26.853 --> 06:30.949
We would like a frank estimate
of how much longer you will take.

06:31.023 --> 06:36.017
- Maybe three years, maybe four.
- It cannot be. It just cannot be.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.029
Oh, my dear Miss Totten,

06:38.097 --> 06:40.622
you wouldn't discontinue
your father's great gesture

06:40.700 --> 06:42.793
towards human enlightenment?

06:42.869 --> 06:45.394
"Human enlightenment."
What nonsense, Professor Jerome.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.838
Papa had just one reason for ever starting
this unfortunate enterprise.

06:48.908 --> 06:49.932
Vanity.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.375
He broke a blood vessel
because he found his name was omitted

06:52.445 --> 06:54.037
from the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

06:54.113 --> 06:57.241
Because 30 pages were devoted
to Thomas Alva Edison,

06:57.316 --> 06:59.307
17 to Alexander Graham Bell,

06:59.385 --> 07:03.947
but not one line to Daniel S. Totten,
the inventor of the electric toaster.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.825
In our encyclopedia,

07:07.894 --> 07:11.091
Mr. Totten shall receive
an appropriate amount of space.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.722
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes, of course.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.996
- Three quarters of a page, I should think.
- Three quarters of a page?

07:16.068 --> 07:17.763
- That's all he deserves.
- Is it?

07:17.837 --> 07:19.498
You may go on, Mr. Larsen.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.097
All we ask is
that you bring this thing to a close

07:22.175 --> 07:24.837
somehow or the other.
Get on with it. Slap it together.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.209
Mr. Larsen, may I have a word?

07:27.280 --> 07:30.511
- Hello, Professor Potts.
- Hello, Miss Totten.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.485
Mr. Larsen, you said, "Slap it together."

07:35.321 --> 07:37.118
We're not the slapping together kind.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.851
We have started an encyclopedia,

07:38.925 --> 07:41.621
and we shall finish it
as thoroughly as is humanly possible.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.561
- Another $100,000?
- If necessary, yes.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.793
If our work goes slowly
it's because the world, it goes so fast.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.131
Take Professor Jerome, our geographer.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.329
He has to rewrite all the time.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.099
- And Dr. Magenbruch...
- LARSEN: I'm not interested.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.299
Don't interrupt, Mr. Larsen.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.502
Go on, Professor.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.736
I'm sure it's your wish that this monument

08:00.813 --> 08:04.112
to your father be finished
as nobly as it was begun.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.918
I'm appealing to you, Miss Totten,

08:09.989 --> 08:11.889
to your vision and to your heart.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.949
Maybe I'm a little inarticulate,

08:14.026 --> 08:16.460
but I've always regarded you as a...

08:16.963 --> 08:18.487
Yes, Professor?

08:20.132 --> 08:22.123
Always regarded you as a...

08:22.201 --> 08:23.168
(EX CLAIMING)

08:23.603 --> 08:25.093
Oh, Professor.

08:27.773 --> 08:31.265
- You know what I mean, Miss Totten.
- Yes.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.869
I warn you, Miss Totten,
another four years of this, with...

08:33.946 --> 08:36.744
After all, it was Father's wish.

08:36.816 --> 08:40.445
But, gentlemen, you will hurry
and finish the encyclopedia, won't you?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.544
- We will.
- Yes, yes, indeed.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.991
Last year, when all the other professors
came to my musical,

08:48.094 --> 08:50.426
where were you, Professor Potts?

08:50.930 --> 08:53.558
Sinus. But I shall be there this year.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.925
I shall look forward to seeing you again.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.664
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.230
- Goodbye, madam.
- Good day.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.070
- Good day.
- Good day.

09:04.343 --> 09:06.538
(MUTTERING EX CITEDLY)

09:06.612 --> 09:09.103
That maneuver down my spine
was very unnecessary.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.046
- Was it, my dear Potts?
- Didn't it work?

09:11.717 --> 09:12.911
MAN: Hi.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.849
I hope you don't mind.
I came through the kitchen.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.356
- POTTS: Who are you?
- I'm the garbage man.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.226
I want to find out something
about Cleopatra.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.784
- Cleopatra?
- Yeah.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.023
This is some kind of a library or school,
isn't it?

09:25.097 --> 09:27.793
Neither, we are writing an encyclopedia.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.028
- Icyclo-what?
- An encyclopedia.

09:30.102 --> 09:32.764
A work which endeavors to compile
and catalog all human knowledge.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.533
Say, that's just what I need.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.666
Young man,
did you come through my kitchen?

09:36.742 --> 09:39.142
- That's right, sister.
- I'm not your sister, and you get out.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.145
- Oh, now...
- Miss Bragg.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.874
Please, Miss Bragg,
we find this intensely interesting.

09:42.949 --> 09:43.938
Go on, please.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.916
You can't tell me
he's not infested with germs.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.148
Then go and get your gas mask.
Now, shoo, scat, skedaddle.

09:49.221 --> 09:52.156
- Please, won't you take a seat?
- Thanks, bo.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.184
I seen all these books
through the window,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.194
and I figured
that maybe you can help me out.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.129
- In what way, young man?
- With this quizzola they got on the radio.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.222
- This what?
- Quizzola?

10:00.299 --> 10:01.926
Korn Krunchies Quiz-Quiz.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.902
Send in 100 box covers,
and you stand to make a little dough.

10:04.971 --> 10:08.498
Well, with my opportunities,
I got about 3,000 box covers together.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.042
Only some of the answers
you have to send in to the questions.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.975
You know, like true or false.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.773
(STUTTERING)
You have those questions here?

10:14.847 --> 10:15.836
Yeah, sure.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.145
Well, that's very interesting.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.943
"Question one. Cleopatra died...

10:22.021 --> 10:24.080
"A. From swallowing a needle.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.090
"B. From snake bite.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.921
"C. From hiccups."

10:28.661 --> 10:31.186
That's my province. I cover history.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.455
The correct answer is "B."

10:33.933 --> 10:38.029
Cleopatra, queen of Egypt,
daughter of Ptolemy XIII, born 69 BC,

10:38.104 --> 10:41.130
killed herself
on the 29th day of August, 30 BC,

10:41.240 --> 10:43.470
by placing an asp to her bosom.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.339
- A what?
- An asp.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.503
A small snake.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.309
Well, patch my pantywaist.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.781
Well, well, next.

"Which way would you say it?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.119

10:59.759 --> 11:02.159
- Did you hear the question, Potts?
- I did.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.321
As the verb
is always governed by the subject,

11:04.397 --> 11:06.831
the correct answer is,
"Two and two are five."

11:06.899 --> 11:09.424
- Potts.
- Oh, no, Potts.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.336
Correct for a grammarian perhaps,
but not for a mathematician.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.998
Two and two are four.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.401
That's a good one.
Nobody's gonna get that.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.070
Well, I certainly am obliged.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.047
I could use a bundle of scratch right now

11:23.115 --> 11:24.742
on account of I met me a mouse last week.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.307
- Mouse?
- What a pair of gams.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.683
A little in, a little out,
and a little more out...

11:28.754 --> 11:30.119
I am still completely mystified.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.588
Well, with this dish on me hands

11:31.657 --> 11:34.524
and them giving away 25 smackaroos
on that quizzola.

11:34.593 --> 11:38.120
- Smackaroos?
- Smackaroos? What are smackaroos?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.461
- A smackaroo is a...
- No such word exists.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.525
Oh, it don't? A smackaroo is a dollar, pal.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.561
Well, the accepted vulgarism
for a dollar is a buck.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.972
The accepted vulgarism
for a smackaroo is a dollar.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.102
That goes for a banger, a fish,
a buck or a rug.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.476
Well, what about the mouse?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.038
The mouse is the dish.
That's what I need the moolah for.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.447
- Moolah?
- Yeah, the dough.

We'll be stepping. Me and this smooch...
I mean, the dish,

12:00.853 --> 12:03.481
I mean, the mouse. You know,
hit the jiggles for a little rum boogie.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.614
Please, please, not so fast.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.214
Brother, we're going to have
some hoytoytoy.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.350
- Hoytoytoy?
- Hoytoytoy?

12:07.426 --> 12:11.021
Yeah, and if you want that one explained,
you go ask your papas.

That's Archie. His water's getting hot.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.295
Well, thanks again, gents.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.896
And if you ever want to get into
a contest sometime,

12:21.974 --> 12:23.669
just call on me.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.974
Maybe you've got the brains,
but I got the box covers.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.744
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, come again.

12:31.183 --> 12:34.175
Well, kind of a breezy fellow, isn't he?

12:34.253 --> 12:35.242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.687
- He seems a most likeable gentleman.
- Yes.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.815
And I'm an idiot.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.552
- Idiot? Why?
- Why?

12:40.626 --> 12:42.253
Miss Bragg. Miss Bragg!

12:42.328 --> 12:43.795
- What's the matter, Potts?
- Well, what's...

12:43.863 --> 12:45.763
- I'm going out.
- PROFESSORS: Going out?

12:45.831 --> 12:47.765
What's your prognosis
on the weather, Gurkakoff?

12:47.833 --> 12:50.301
- Light showers toward the evening, but...
- Yes, Professor Potts?

12:50.369 --> 12:52.030
Miss Bragg, my hat and my mackintosh.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.628
And put my luncheon sandwich
in the pocket.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.832
- But...
- Immediately.

12:54.907 --> 12:55.896
- Yes, sir.
- What's happened?

12:55.975 --> 12:57.636
What do you mean
you're going out, Potts?

12:57.710 --> 12:59.473
- Where are you going?
- Research.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.103
Research? What research?

13:01.180 --> 13:03.546
- The garbage man. Didn't you hear him?
- Yes.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.141
Well, I didn't quite understand all he said.

13:06.218 --> 13:09.415
Nor did I. And it's catastrophic, gentlemen,
catastrophic.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.853
- Why?
- How so?

13:10.923 --> 13:13.153
I've just finished my article on slang.

13:13.225 --> 13:16.194
Twenty-three pages compiled
from a dozen reference books.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.991
- Eight hundred examples.
- Well?

13:18.063 --> 13:20.463
Everything
from the idiotic combination "absotively"

13:20.533 --> 13:22.194
to the pejorative use of "zigzag."

13:22.268 --> 13:23.792
I traced the evolution of "hunky dory,"

13:23.869 --> 13:26.360
tracked down "skiddo" from "skedaddle."

13:26.739 --> 13:29.503
Eight hundred examples and I may as well
throw it in the waste basket.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.066
- Three weeks' work.
- Potts, you're hysterical.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.806

- Hoytoytoy?
- Hoytoytoy. Not one of them included.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.381
Living in this house cut off from the world,
I've lost touch.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.821
And it's inexcusable.

13:45.891 --> 13:49.258
That man talked a living language.
I embalmed some dead phrases.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.263
- But where are you going?
- Out to collect new data,

13:52.331 --> 13:55.323
to tap the sources of slang,
the major sources.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.096
The streets. The slums.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.036
- The theatrical and allied professions.
- Oh, now, Potts, don't you think that...

14:00.105 --> 14:02.073
I know it's regrettable,
this loss of time, gentlemen,

14:02.141 --> 14:03.904
but it must be done.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.377
Leave the key under the mat.
I won't be home before 9:00.

14:08.447 --> 14:09.709
Yes, sir.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.811
I'm writing about the planet Saturn.

14:13.886 --> 14:16.719
Do I insist on going to the planet Saturn?

14:17.656 --> 14:21.717
Maybe my data on sex
is a little outdated, too.

14:23.729 --> 14:27.028

Four words, blitz it, mister.
Blitz it, will you? You give me the mimis.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.489
- "Mimis"?
- Yeah, the screaming mimis.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.619
Extremely picturesque.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.492
Young man,
could I interest you in a research project

14:58.564 --> 14:59.895
in which you could be very helpful?

14:59.965 --> 15:02.627
And what you promoting?
Some kind of reform school?

at 9:30 tomorrow morning,

15:05.004 --> 15:07.131

- One of the boys.
- He was on kind of an errand

that dope.

21:57.182 --> 22:00.174

when the bulls gave Benny a ticket,

22:02.254 --> 22:03.721
they saw Kinnick in the back of the car.

22:03.789 --> 22:04.949
- Dead.
- In the accident?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.547
That's what Benny was trying to tell them.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.786
- Only they saw Kinnick's feet.
- They was in a cake of cement.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.418
Benny was gonna dump him
in the East River.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.191
- That was the errand.
- What is all this? Where do I come...

22:13.265 --> 22:15.233
Wait a second.
Is Joe Lilac mixed up in this?

22:15.300 --> 22:16.927
The DA had him picked up
about a half hour ago.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.300
That's why we're here.
That's why you got to beat it.

- Yeah.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.706

He was framed, Sugie, honest he was,
may I drop down dead.

22:25.143 --> 22:27.543
- Wasn't he, Asthma?
- And there was them pajamas they found.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.307
- Pajamas?
- Yeah, that's where you come in.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.941
Remember the dozen pink ones
you gave to the boss last Christmas?

Before you knew
that the only color Joe Lilac wears is lilac?

22:34.286 --> 22:35.878
- Yeah.
- So we handed them out to the boys.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.980
And in the suitcase right beside
Benny the Creep when he gets caught

22:39.057 --> 22:41.150
is a pair with that big JL monogram.

- Hello.

but mine is a very...

23:01.646 --> 23:02.840
Cut the corners. What is it?

23:02.914 --> 23:05.815
Well, this inquiry
is one of considerable importance.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.852
- Stop beating up with the gums.
- What was that?

23:07.919 --> 23:09.409
Get this. I don't know from nothing.

23:09.488 --> 23:12.184
Oh, but you do.
Every word you say proves as much.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.657
- Where's that paper?
- Subpoena?

23:14.726 --> 23:17.991
Suppose you tell the DA
to take a nice running jump for himself?

23:18.063 --> 23:21.191
Bewildering. And you want to tell me
you're not the person I'm looking for?

23:21.266 --> 23:24.929
- Say, how many of you are on this job?
- The entire project? Eight.

23:25.003 --> 23:28.131
Oh. The other seven waiting outside?

23:28.206 --> 23:30.197
Oh, no. They're at home.
Sound asleep I imagine.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.971
- Asleep?
- Yes, they go to bed at 9:00 every night.

23:33.044 --> 23:36.138
Do you mean to tell me
with crime what it is in New York...

23:36.214 --> 23:37.943
Say, are you a bull or aren't you?

23:38.016 --> 23:41.008
Well, if bull is the slang word
for professor, then I'm a bull.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.644
- A professor?
- Of English.

23:42.721 --> 23:43.710
Oh.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.950
I thought
there was some misunderstanding.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.150
Sure was.

23:47.225 --> 23:49.557
You see, I'm conducting an investigation
on current slang.

23:49.628 --> 23:52.426
Would you object
if I used you for observation and study?

23:52.497 --> 23:54.192
- Yeah, I would.
- If I could have your assistance

23:54.266 --> 23:55.358
for just a few days it would be...

23:55.434 --> 23:56.992
Out, out, Professor.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.468
- Then you won't help me?
- No. Out. Shove in your clutch.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.870
"Shove in your clutch."
Exactly the kind of thing I want.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.408
Perhaps if I could come back here again
when you have more time...

24:04.476 --> 24:06.740
Save the gas. I won't be here after tonight.

to change your mind by any chance.

- Well, I'll just leave it here.
- Okay, scrow, scram, scraw.

24:17.422 --> 24:20.516
The complete conjugation.
All right, I'll scraw.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.586
Stop futzing around.
You haven't got time to get dressed.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.187
- All right. Only I...
- PASTRAMl: We'll go out the window.

24:26.264 --> 24:27.925
I think you're a pair of cracked dice.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.933

- Look out, mister.

24:38.276 --> 24:39.641
Good night.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.110
- Miss O'Shea.
- What do you want?

24:44.349 --> 24:45.782
Right there.

24:52.591 --> 24:55.116
Open up. District Attorney's office.

25:07.472 --> 25:09.997
- Where to?
- Just keep cruising, Jack.

25:11.076 --> 25:14.273
- Well?
- How about that warehouse on West 11th?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.779
- No. Too many rats.
- Hey, wait a minute.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.077
- Where are you taking me?
- It's just for the night, Sugarpuss.

25:18.149 --> 25:20.140
We can't take you to your place,
they'll have it covered.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.482
Joe's apartment,
they got sealed up like a can of coffee.

25:22.554 --> 25:25.114
Oh, I see.
Yeah, but you live someplace, don't you?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.589
Yeah, sure and the cops know where.

25:26.658 --> 25:30.059
Yeah, hotel, I thought of a hotel,
but they'll fan every hotel in town.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.425
Well, I could change my name.

25:31.496 --> 25:34.988
Listen, Sugie, why take chances?
It's an awful nice warehouse.

25:35.066 --> 25:38.399
He says rats, big mouth does.
Well, maybe a few little bitty mice.

25:38.470 --> 25:39.459
Uh-uh. That's out.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.598
Tomorrow we'll get hold of a lawyer
and figure out something with more class.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.505
Say, I got an uncle who's an undertaker

25:44.576 --> 25:46.806
and with business like it is,
he's always got an extra slab.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.870
That's fine. That's all I need.
Keep thinking.

25:50.982 --> 25:52.711

25:52.784 --> 25:55.378

Oh, that's that professor jerk.

25:59.991 --> 26:00.980
Uh-oh.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.389
I never would have believed it.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.263
But how do you account for the name?

26:10.335 --> 26:11.825
Have I missed anything?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.768
No, I was just about to explain...

26:13.838 --> 26:16.272
- You see, the word "puss" means face.
- Yes.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.935
As for instance, sourpuss, picklepuss.

26:19.711 --> 26:22.373
Sugarpuss implies
a certain sweetness in her appearance.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.436
- Sugar, yes, yes.
- Yes.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.073
Never mind the etymology.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.742
- Was she...
- Was she blonde or brunette?

26:26.818 --> 26:29.616
- Yes, which?
- That, I don't know. I didn't notice.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.080
But her vocabulary,
even in ordinary conversation...

26:32.157 --> 26:33.988
You spoke to her?

26:34.059 --> 26:35.856
- Yes, in her dressing room...
- In her dressing room?

26:35.927 --> 26:37.758
- Backstage?
- Yes.

26:37.829 --> 26:41.492
Unfortunately,
she disclaimed any interest in our project

26:43.134 --> 26:46.001
in words so bizarre
they made my mouth water.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.938
- "Shove in your clutch," for instance.
- Why, it's amazing.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.032
Potts, could you tell us
what was it like backstage?

26:51.109 --> 26:52.872
Very vivacious, I imagine.

26:52.944 --> 26:57.438
And perhaps, ballerinas giggling
up and down iron staircases.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.073
Around and around.

26:59.150 --> 27:01.778
- Possibly wearing tights.
- Tights.

27:01.853 --> 27:04.947
And that ineffable smell of rice powder.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.684
On nude shoulders.

27:08.426 --> 27:09.552
Well.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.494
It's getting a bit late, gentlemen.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.759
Perhaps we had better get to bed.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.309
Someday, I'll tell you my experiences

27:25.377 --> 27:27.242
with a young actress
named Lillian Russell.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.336
Did you know her?

27:28.413 --> 27:30.347
I stood in the snow four hours to get to...

27:30.415 --> 27:31.439
(DOORBELL RINGING)

27:31.516 --> 27:33.416
Is that our doorbell?

27:33.485 --> 27:34.952
But it's 12:25.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.319
It must be the statistics
on San Salvador's saltpeter.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.646
I'll get it.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.784
I asked for it to be sent registered airmail.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.426
Hi-de-ho.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.898
Don't tell me I'm too late for class,
Professor.

27:50.969 --> 27:51.958
Oh, my goodness gracious.

27:53.271 --> 27:54.863
Say, what is that?

27:56.107 --> 27:58.302
- Those are my colleagues.
- Oh.

27:59.077 --> 28:02.513
- I apologize for their lack of costume.
- Oh, that's all right, Professor.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.343
And the fact
that I haven't got my tie on and...

28:04.416 --> 28:07.647
Oh, you know,
once I watched my big brother shave.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.581
- Won't you come in?
- Why not?

28:12.624 --> 28:15.684
Frankly, your coming here
was the last thing I expected.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.022
Your "no" was so explicit.

28:17.095 --> 28:18.585
Well, I got thinking it over

28:18.663 --> 28:21.257
and "Foo," I said to myself,
"Who am I to give science the brush?"

28:21.332 --> 28:24.859
- Then I take it you've reconsidered?
- Yeah, that's the big idea.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.062
Well.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.600
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

28:29.507 --> 28:30.769
Look out.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.639
- Well, that was Professor Oddly.
- Any more of them around?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.113
I hope not.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.044
Say, who decorated this place?

28:41.453 --> 28:43.080
- The mug that shot Lincoln?
- This is our work room.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.849
The living quarters are upstairs.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.950
That's a lot of books. All of them different?

28:49.060 --> 28:50.049
- I trust.
- Uh-huh.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.686
- May I have your coat?
- Yeah, thanks.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.598
Miss O'Shea.

28:57.602 --> 29:01.732
Greek philosophy,
I've got a set like this with a radio inside.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.266
Are you sure you don't want your coat?

29:04.342 --> 29:07.368
No, I'm fine.
Except I've got a run in this stocking.

29:07.445 --> 29:08.969
Well, how do we start, Professor?

29:09.047 --> 29:12.175
You see, this is the first time
anybody moved in on my brain.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.514
Have you got some kind of a machine,

29:14.586 --> 29:17.714
an X-ray or a vacuum cleaner maybe
that sorts out the words you want?

29:17.789 --> 29:19.347
What's your method, Professor?

29:19.424 --> 29:22.723
Well, it's quite simple. If you will be here
tomorrow morning not later than 9:30...

29:22.794 --> 29:23.783
Tomorrow morning?

29:23.862 --> 29:26.592
Why, yes.
I have arranged a round table discussion

29:26.664 --> 29:29.462
with a few people of various backgrounds.

29:29.534 --> 29:30.660
Uh-huh.

29:30.735 --> 29:34.535
You don't think we could sort of
begin the Beguine right now?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.699
Well, it's nearly 1:00, Miss O'Shea.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.868
Oh, foo, Professor,
let's get ourselves a couple of drinks,

29:38.943 --> 29:41.673
light the fire maybe, and you can start
working on me right away.

29:41.746 --> 29:45.011
I wouldn't think of imposing upon you
at this hour.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.950
Listen, I figured on working all night.

29:48.019 --> 29:51.614
Well, any hasty random discussion
would be of no scientific value.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.623
You see, I have to have my notes
thoroughly prepared

29:53.691 --> 29:55.716
- for the seminar tomorrow.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.295
Okay. Where do I sleep?

29:59.030 --> 30:00.759
I don't know. Where do you live?

30:00.832 --> 30:02.561
Up on Riverside.
But I'm going to sleep here.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.828
Here?

30:03.902 --> 30:05.836
You don't understand, Miss O'Shea.

30:05.904 --> 30:09.806
We're all bachelors with the exception
of Professor Oddly, who is a widower.

30:09.874 --> 30:11.637
Why, no woman ever...

30:12.210 --> 30:14.303
Even Miss Bragg who takes care
of our needs

30:14.379 --> 30:16.711
goes home every night at 7:30.

30:16.781 --> 30:19.272
If you want me
tomorrow morning at 9:30, you...

30:19.350 --> 30:21.250
Oh, I do, Miss O'Shea.

30:23.555 --> 30:27.047
Even the most free-thinking people
must respect the...

30:28.193 --> 30:29.990
All right, feel that.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.393
Go on. Feel that foot.

30:33.932 --> 30:36.423
Okay, tootsie bell, what do you say?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.992
- It's cold.
- It's cold and it's wet.

30:40.638 --> 30:42.196
Now, come here.

30:44.309 --> 30:45.640
Come here.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.474
Closer.

30:51.115 --> 30:52.309
Closer.

30:53.117 --> 30:55.085
Come on, give.

30:55.153 --> 30:57.747
Hello, kids. Look down my throat.

30:57.822 --> 30:59.414
Go on. Look down.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.390
All right, right down there, look.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.620
I don't know what to look for.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.722
There is possibly a slight rosiness
in the laryngeal region.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.289
Slight rosiness?

31:09.367 --> 31:11.767
It's as red as the <i>Daily Worker</i>
and just as sore.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.360
- Who are you?
- I'm...

31:13.438 --> 31:14.598
Who is he?

31:14.672 --> 31:18.108
This is Dr. Magenbruch,
our physiological expert.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.007
This is Professor Robinson, law.

31:20.078 --> 31:23.912
- Professor Gurkakoff...
- Not so fast. Just let it creep up on me.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.381
I'll get to know them.

31:25.450 --> 31:28.681
Come here, physiology.
For all I know, I've got a fever. Feel.

31:28.753 --> 31:30.015
- It's possible.
- Certainly.

31:30.088 --> 31:32.488
And he wants to throw me out on my tin.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.321
There'll be no 9:30 for me
if you let me go out in the rain now.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.417
Naturally not.

31:36.494 --> 31:38.894
With the streets cold
and the subway hot and full of germs.

31:38.963 --> 31:41.397
I'm a push-over for streptococcus.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.494
- Can I have this now, kid?
- Pardon me.

31:45.370 --> 31:48.669
We'll call you a heated taxi and furnish you
with woolen socks and warm slippers.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.174
- How do you like that?
- Really, I don't understand you, Potts.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.574
- Why take chances?
- With valuable material?

31:53.645 --> 31:56.546
- You must think of your article, Potts.
- See, they get the point.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.741
If I might venture a suggestion,

31:58.850 --> 32:00.579
why couldn't the young lady
sleep in my room?

32:00.652 --> 32:01.846
- What?
- What?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.047
- Well!
- Professor Peagram!

32:04.822 --> 32:06.756
I can bunk in with Professor Robinson.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.655
I sometimes do
when there's an electric storm.

32:08.726 --> 32:10.523
Yes, he's afraid of thunder.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.927
Well, then it's all settled.

32:12.997 --> 32:16.262
Well, I guess I'll turn in.
Can I have my coat?

32:16.334 --> 32:18.928
- Of course.
- Thank you.

32:19.003 --> 32:21.062
- Hi-de-ho, fellows.
- Hi-de-ho.

32:21.906 --> 32:24.704
- I'll show you to my room.
- Yes, we all will go.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.141
I know where my own room is, thank you,

32:26.210 --> 32:28.303
- without any help from you.
- Why shouldn't... Why shouldn't...

32:28.379 --> 32:31.041
I'll find it. Don't bother.
Just rough out the directions.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.743
Top of the stairs
and the third door on the left.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.683
Gentlemen, just a moment, please.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.277
Gentlemen, this is all highly irregular.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.482
What if this should come
to the attention of the Foundation?

32:39.557 --> 32:40.922
And what about Miss Bragg tomorrow?

32:40.992 --> 32:43.552
What are you talking about?
This is research, isn't it?

32:43.628 --> 32:44.890
- Yes.
- Certainly.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.693
Who was that guy learned so much
from watching an apple drop?

32:47.765 --> 32:51.826
Isaac Newton, 1642 to 1727.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.565
- The law of gravity.
- Yeah, that's him.

32:55.139 --> 32:59.235
And I want you to look at me
as another apple, Professor Potts.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.039
Just another apple.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.752
It fits you like a glove,
you admit that, don't you?

33:11.823 --> 33:15.122
I like a little more effect around
the shoulders, sort of a puffed sleeve.

33:15.193 --> 33:18.754
- You know that JL could be Joe Lilac.
- Could be.

33:19.297 --> 33:22.391
- Still claim it isn't yours?
- No, it isn't and never was.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.493
Come on, loosen up, Joe.
It's 5:00 in the morning.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.902
How's about a little Benzedrine?

33:27.972 --> 33:30.065
- Put it on Benny the Creep.
- Sure.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.472
Take off your coat.

33:31.542 --> 33:34.943
I should have brought along my valet.
I'm a sucker for comfort.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.675
Why, don't worry, Joe.
You'll have your comfort.

33:37.749 --> 33:42.152
We'll have platinum bars on your cell,
and we'll heat up a chair for you, special.

33:42.253 --> 33:43.777
Twenty thousand volts.

33:45.256 --> 33:46.518
AC or DC?

33:50.261 --> 33:52.786
- So those are your pajamas, huh?
- Yep.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.191
You always wear them
three sizes too big?

33:56.267 --> 34:00.533
Allows for my chest expansion.
And my fingers get kind of chilly at night.

34:00.605 --> 34:02.539
And the JL?

34:03.775 --> 34:06.869
It stands for jellybean.
It stands for lollipop.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.010
- Take him away.
- Come on.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.208
That's fine. That's great.

34:13.484 --> 34:16.647
You never heard of Benny the Creep.
Benny the Creep never heard of you.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.985
There was no murder.
And there is no murder ring

34:19.056 --> 34:22.288
with you at the control boards
pushing the buttons.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.556
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hiya, McNeary?

34:24.629 --> 34:26.790
Morning, and pardon my glove,
Mr. District Attorney.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.491
Good morning.

34:28.565 --> 34:33.003
- All right, I've got a writ of habeas corpus.
- I've forgotten my reading glasses.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.232
Too bad. Come on, Joe.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.297
May be a couple of days
before I find them.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.503
- I won't stand for my client's...
- It's all right, McNeary.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.545
The man's trying to clean up the city.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.808
Why not give him
all the cooperation we can?

34:44.882 --> 34:48.340
- Does that mean you're going to talk, Joe?
- What about?

34:49.187 --> 34:51.712
Well, I'll make the pajamas talk.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.780
Here's the sales slip for them.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.918
They were bought by Miss O'Shea.
She bought them for you.

34:56.994 --> 35:00.088
Or maybe you never heard of her.
Maybe she isn't your girlfriend.

35:00.164 --> 35:04.362
- Why bring a lady's name into this?
- I'll bring the lady in herself.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.371
Where do we stand with that O'Shea girl?
What?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.839
What about the deputies?

35:10.908 --> 35:12.535
All right, let me talk to Collins himself.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.134
- What about the girl?
- Don't worry.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.578
We've got her in safe deposit temporarily.

35:16.647 --> 35:19.810
- Temporarily is not good enough.
- I've got something figured out.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.977
- Nothing gloomy, I hope.
- Strictly legal.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.577
A wife can't testify against her husband.

35:23.654 --> 35:25.349
- She's not my wife.
- Not yet, she isn't.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.653
But once they let you go,
we'll pull a fastie.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.056
Of all the incompetent...

35:29.127 --> 35:30.856
What sweetheart dreamed up that law?

35:30.928 --> 35:34.989
Don't give me that. You've had six hours.
Tell those guys to get a jump on.

35:37.768 --> 35:39.360
Having some trouble, Mr. DA?

35:39.437 --> 35:40.768
Don't worry, Joe.

35:40.838 --> 35:43.807
And don't underestimate this office
or the State of New York.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.935
I've got some boys
that can find a needle in a haystack.

35:47.011 --> 35:48.205
Why, that's a cinch.

35:48.279 --> 35:52.579
All you have to do is get a horse
to eat the hay and then X-ray the horse.

35:53.885 --> 35:54.510
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

35:59.957 --> 36:01.720
Okay. Okay.

36:03.261 --> 36:04.888
Hold your horses.

36:07.765 --> 36:10.029
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36:10.134 --> 36:12.967
What time is it?
This is worse than being in the army.

36:13.037 --> 36:16.006
Professor Potts started
the round table discussion 10 minutes ago.

36:16.073 --> 36:18.439
He did? Say, that's divastigating.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.205
- And this came for you.
- Who brought it?

36:21.712 --> 36:24.180
- A couple of persons.
- Any message?

36:24.248 --> 36:27.308
- Well, they spoke very picturesquely.
- Yeah, very.

36:27.385 --> 36:30.479
Yes, they said it's getting hot and hotter

36:30.555 --> 36:33.353
and to stay in the icebox
like a good little salad.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.688
And this is the dressing.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.285
- The salad, huh?
- And we wondered what it meant.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.386
Yes, we did.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.260
I'll tell you, sweetie. I...

36:41.332 --> 36:42.697
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.394
- Miss Bragg.
- Oh, my goodness.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.766
Sounds like Mother calling.
Kids, you better go.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.771
See you later.

36:48.839 --> 36:52.832
- Gentlemen, where are you, gentlemen?
- We're coming, Miss Bragg, we're coming.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.378
- On our way.
- I would like to talk to you.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.435
I wanted to ask you,

36:56.514 --> 36:58.482
what were all your trousers
doing in my kitchen?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.847
- I wanted mine pressed.
- Well, that accounts for one pair.

37:00.918 --> 37:02.715
- I did, too.
- Mine, too.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.652
Seven pairs, all at once?

37:04.722 --> 37:06.781
What's going on in this house anyway?

37:06.857 --> 37:09.849
No constitutional this morning.
You've hardly touched your breakfast.

37:09.927 --> 37:13.260
Professor Potts in the dining room with
a conglomeration of dubious characters.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.457
You, not at your desks.

37:14.532 --> 37:18.059
- That's right, gentlemen, we have to work.
- Yes, we have to work.

37:18.135 --> 37:23.038
- What were you doing upstairs, anyway?
- We took up a suitcase.

37:23.107 --> 37:24.836
- Suitcase?
- Yes.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.173
- Whose suitcase?
- We're very busy, Miss Bragg.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.439
I said, whose suitcase?

37:28.512 --> 37:31.845
Well, now, Miss Bragg, there is...

37:33.584 --> 37:36.018
- There is someone staying with us.
- Staying with us?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.920
- That's it.
- Who?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.389
Who's staying with us?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.653
What's the matter? Cat got your tongues?

37:42.727 --> 37:44.854
- Who's staying with us?
- (VOICE CRACKING) Well, I...

37:44.929 --> 37:48.365
- Well, I... Oh, dear.
- Professor Potts didn't tell you?

37:48.432 --> 37:50.764
- No, and I want to know.
- Well, under the pressure

37:50.835 --> 37:53.030
- of a very trying assignment...
- Yes?

37:53.104 --> 37:55.368
- He's...
- Go on.

37:55.439 --> 37:58.067
- He's taken a temporary assistant.
- Yes.

37:58.142 --> 38:01.043
- So we're running a hotel now.
- Not exactly.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.240
It seems to me that... Professor Robinson,

38:04.315 --> 38:07.648
- is that one of your socks?
- No, not mine.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.079
I wish that it...

38:11.722 --> 38:15.021
Well, I know Professor Peagram
explains the corset he wears

38:15.092 --> 38:16.491
as due to a floating kidney.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.959
What's the explanation of this?

38:18.029 --> 38:22.329
Say, kids, I'm stuck.
Any of you can jerk a zipper?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.628
A zipper?

38:23.701 --> 38:26.067
Yeah, the darn thing's stuck...

38:26.137 --> 38:27.866
Hello, who are you?

38:27.938 --> 38:31.465
- This is our Miss Bragg.
- Miss... Did you say Bag?

38:31.542 --> 38:33.100
Bragg. How do you do?

38:33.177 --> 38:35.111
Great-o.
Do you know anything about zippers?

38:35.179 --> 38:36.578
- Do you? Do you?
- Well, I...

38:36.647 --> 38:37.944
- Well, do you?
- Do I?

38:38.015 --> 38:41.416
- No, I don't, but Professor Gurkakoff.
- Okay.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.511
- Well, it's purely mechanical.
- But look, you were married.

38:44.588 --> 38:45.782
No, I'm just a botanist.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.188
Look, kids, after all,
you know, this is only a zipper.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.489
- Come on, Gurky.
- Well, I can try.

38:50.561 --> 38:52.825
You know, I had this happen one night
in the middle of my act.

38:52.897 --> 38:55.730
I couldn't get a thing off,
was I embarrassed.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.199
How's chances for a cup of coffee?

38:57.268 --> 39:00.260
- No breakfast after 9:00.
- You see, it's a rule.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.432
Just like my Aunt Beulah that
brought me up, that's why I left home.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.496
- There.
- Oh, swell.

39:04.575 --> 39:06.338
Now where is this little clambake
of Professor Potts'?

39:06.410 --> 39:09.811
- In the dining room, just across the hall.
- In the dining room. See you later, kids.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.848
Don't tell me the jive session
has beat off without baby.

39:17.922 --> 39:20.390
Shut the door please, Miss O'Shea.

39:23.894 --> 39:24.918
You're late.

39:24.995 --> 39:27.190
I won't waste time with introductions.
These are our collaborators.

39:27.264 --> 39:28.788
- Hi, kids.
- Hi.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.391
As I was saying, I've worked out
a series of cross-references

39:31.469 --> 39:33.562
which I believe will be the best approach
to our subject.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.070
Going like gangbusters, isn't he?

39:35.139 --> 39:36.800
Sit down, please.

39:40.144 --> 39:43.341
I don't think
you'll find our venture dull, Miss O'Shea.

39:43.414 --> 39:47.248
The scientific conquest of
an important subject is never dull.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.680
"Slang," as the poet
Carl Sandburg has said,

39:50.755 --> 39:52.416
"is language which takes off its coat,

39:52.490 --> 39:54.651
"spits on its hands and goes to work."

39:54.725 --> 39:57.626
Let us... Let us, too,
then get down to work.

40:04.301 --> 40:07.202
Well, we've accomplished a lot
in the last three days,

40:07.271 --> 40:09.796
and I'm very grateful to all of you.

40:09.874 --> 40:12.365
There's another word
I'd like to take up now.

40:12.443 --> 40:14.502
It's recurred several times
in our discussions,

40:14.578 --> 40:16.569
and its meaning still eludes me.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.239
I think it was Miss O'Shea
who used it yesterday

40:18.315 --> 40:20.943
in reference to the cuffs that I wear.

40:21.018 --> 40:23.748
- The word is "corny."
- Yeah, wouldn't you say they were corny?

40:23.821 --> 40:27.188
- Because of the cornstarch in them?
- Because it's 1941.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.884
- Then corny means old-fashioned.
- Kind of hick, loose-tooth.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.486
Mortimer Snerd.

40:34.298 --> 40:35.856
Oh, gee.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.128
There's other kinds of corn, too.

40:38.202 --> 40:39.863
When you give your girl
your fraternity pin,

40:39.937 --> 40:42.235
well, if she says, "I'll keep it forever,"

40:42.306 --> 40:44.570
- that's corny, too.
- Yeah, or take a joke.

40:44.642 --> 40:46.439
"That's no lady, that's my wife."

40:46.510 --> 40:48.842
Making your baby's shoes into ashtrays.

40:48.913 --> 40:50.278
- That's corn.
- Right off the cob.

40:50.347 --> 40:52.645
Well, let's stick to corn.

40:52.716 --> 40:54.581
Is it synonymous with baloney?

40:54.652 --> 40:57.746
No, it's anything
that gets them in the sticks.

40:57.822 --> 41:00.416
"Long time, no see," that's Indian corn.

41:00.491 --> 41:02.049
Yeah, when a guy comes to see a girl
and says,

41:02.126 --> 41:03.957
"Let's turn off the lights,
it hurts my eyes."

41:04.028 --> 41:05.723
Brother, that's corn.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.856
The implication is
he's trying to pull some hoytoytoy.

41:08.933 --> 41:12.892
- You're catching on, Professor.
- Countrified, old-fashioned, sentimental.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.406
Business kind of peaked, Jack?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.386
Yeah, it takes up a lot of time
being on the faculty.

41:30.454 --> 41:32.422
- I'll buy the heap.
- There's no call for you to do that.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.321
Why not?
I want to line my bureau drawers.

41:34.391 --> 41:35.517
Gee, thanks.

41:36.293 --> 41:39.524
- Back in a second, Professor.
- Oh, yes, all right.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.672
- Miss O'Shea.
- Just a minute.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.076
- Miss O'Shea.
- Yeah?

42:01.151 --> 42:03.016
We saw you pass the library arch,

42:03.087 --> 42:05.385
and we kind of got a little problem
on our hands.

42:05.456 --> 42:06.889
- Would you help us?
- Why, I'd love to.

42:06.957 --> 42:07.981
Oh, good.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.760
You're kind of spruced up today,
aren't you, Professor?

42:10.828 --> 42:12.455
- The spats?
- Yeah.

42:12.530 --> 42:16.159
I ran across them in my bottom drawer.
Why let the moths eat them?

42:16.233 --> 42:18.292
Attaboy. What's your problem, sweetie?

42:18.369 --> 42:20.234
- Well, look.
- Let me start again.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.462
ODDLY: But, Professor,
I'm completely exhausted.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.737
But we've got to get it right.
Now, start with the right foot.

42:25.809 --> 42:27.470
- The left foot.
- The right foot.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.603
Gentlemen, it's the left foot.

42:28.679 --> 42:30.738
- Which foot, please?
- The right foot.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.907
All right, but you're wrong.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.612
One, two, three, four.

42:35.686 --> 42:38.086
One, two, three.

42:38.155 --> 42:40.623
But I can't "humph" from here.

42:41.825 --> 42:44.988
We've been working on it
ever since luncheon.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.188
Holy smoke.

42:46.263 --> 42:49.858
- Start again with the left foot, come on.
- The left foot.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.503
One, two, three.

42:55.639 --> 42:57.334
Well, it's the right motion.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.775
- But it doesn't feel right.
- It doesn't look right.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.109
Possibly it isn't right.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.512
There was two "humphs." Humph, humph.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.017
Well, that would make it right.
Humph, humph.

43:08.852 --> 43:10.114
You're wrong, my dear Gurkakoff.

43:10.187 --> 43:12.815
Mathematics can never be wrong.
Look here, I'll show you.

43:12.890 --> 43:15.120
- Stay there, Professor Oddly.
- Show him.

43:16.860 --> 43:18.293
One, two.

43:18.362 --> 43:20.159
Professor Oddly, please stand up.

43:20.230 --> 43:21.458
I beg your pardon.

43:21.532 --> 43:25.093
- One, two, three. Humph, humph.
- Just one.

43:26.170 --> 43:28.934
- The expert is here. We need you.
- What's the trouble?

43:29.006 --> 43:30.837
Well, that dance you showed us last night.

43:30.908 --> 43:32.637
- Yeah?
- Yes, maybe we're not very bright.

43:32.710 --> 43:36.510
Professor Gurkakoff has been trying
to reconstruct it by compound fractions.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.912

- Who, me? Thank you.

between the steps and the music.

to take the price tag off.

46:23.981 --> 46:27.348
As soon as you gentlemen get your breath,
we had better have a conference.

46:27.417 --> 46:28.907
Will you please leave the room,
Miss O'Shea?

46:28.986 --> 46:32.945
- But we've only just started.
- If you please, Miss O'Shea.

46:33.023 --> 46:34.957
Loose-tooth again.

46:35.025 --> 46:36.890
Now, if you gentlemen will be kind enough

46:38.562 --> 46:40.427
to get together all that you've written
in the last three days...

46:40.497 --> 46:41.828
(TAPPING AT DOOR)

46:48.639 --> 46:49.765
Well, it's about time.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.740
I thought you two had amnesia
and forgot where you parked me.

46:51.809 --> 46:52.833
Hold the phone, Sugie.

46:52.910 --> 46:55.208
Dropping me on the doorstep
like a throwaway for a credit dentist.

46:55.279 --> 46:57.304
- You said it was for one night.
- Sugie, for snap's sake.

46:57.381 --> 46:59.611
You're as hot as a pistol.
The DA's got 100 men on the job.

46:59.683 --> 47:02.311
Why, they're squeezing this town
through a sieve, borough by borough.

47:02.386 --> 47:03.614
You tell her, Pastrami.

47:03.687 --> 47:06.349
They're tailing us, Sugie. Took us
three hours to get here from 48th Street.

47:06.423 --> 47:08.220
Detoured through Jamaica, Long Island
to shake them off.

47:08.292 --> 47:09.350
Okay, you wait here.

47:09.426 --> 47:10.825
I'll get my things together
in two seconds flat.

47:10.894 --> 47:12.293
Hey, wait a minute, Sugie.

47:12.362 --> 47:16.025
- We got a surprise for you.
- You ain't leaving, not right yet.

47:16.099 --> 47:17.361
I'm not? Joe's out, isn't he?

47:17.434 --> 47:20.403
Yeah, but for how long? They're laying
for you so they can get him back.

47:20.470 --> 47:21.494
That's the surprise.

47:21.572 --> 47:24.302
I'm supposed to stay in this old mans'
home till the moths eat holes in me?

47:24.374 --> 47:26.865
Say, when I say a surprise,
I mean a surprise.

47:26.944 --> 47:28.639
Go on, flash it to her.

47:28.712 --> 47:31.078
Put on your sunglasses, Sugie.

47:31.715 --> 47:34.582
- Oh, boy.
- Seven grand boiled into that one, Sugie.

47:35.385 --> 47:37.751
Joe doesn't have to bribe me
just because I do him a little favor.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.379
It's not a bribe, don't take it like that.

47:39.456 --> 47:40.616
Let him try and get it back though.

47:40.691 --> 47:41.851
Say, it's not your size, is it?

47:41.925 --> 47:43.790
It'll do, if I have to whittle down my finger.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.091
Third finger, left hand, Sugie.

47:46.163 --> 47:48.256
- Who do you think you're kidding?
- The future Mrs. Joe Lilac.

47:48.332 --> 47:50.129
- Come again?
- Wedding bells, sweetheart.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.792
Joe and the lawyer have got it
all figured out.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.666
Yeah, a wife can't testify
against husband, see.

47:53.737 --> 47:55.068
Don't put it like that, you dope.

47:55.138 --> 47:59.336
Say, he's been thataway about you
ever since he first picked you out.

47:59.409 --> 48:01.843
Yeah, but it took the DA
to make him pop the question.

48:01.912 --> 48:03.038
He sent you a love message.

48:03.113 --> 48:06.139
He says to tell you he gets more bang
out of you than any dame he ever knew.

48:06.216 --> 48:09.413
And he's the top, Sugie,
do you realize that? He's the top.

48:09.519 --> 48:10.986
Mrs. Joe Lilac.

48:11.054 --> 48:13.716
Third Avenue girl
in the major league at last.

48:13.790 --> 48:16.088
Wait till they find out,
those other dolls in the show.

48:16.159 --> 48:18.252
Watch me break their crockery with this.

48:18.328 --> 48:19.920
Here, here,
the wedding's got to be a fast one, though.

48:19.997 --> 48:21.259
Over in New Jersey someplace.

48:21.331 --> 48:23.765
Now, this is the application for the license,
and you sign right here.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.495
- Will I? You got a pen?
- Yeah.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.799
- Unscrew it for Mrs. Lilac.
- Right here, right here.

48:27.871 --> 48:28.963
You know, I can't make up my mind.

48:29.039 --> 48:33.373
Will I continue my night club career
or bust in on the Helen Hayes racket?

48:33.443 --> 48:35.206
Say, this ought to be signed
before a notary public.

48:35.279 --> 48:37.975
I'm a notary public,
permission expires 1943.

48:38.048 --> 48:39.777
Were those pajamas a good investment.

48:39.850 --> 48:41.875
You'll get the final dope
by tomorrow morning.

48:41.952 --> 48:43.044
Joe will phone around 10:00.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.554
Now, meantime lie low
and stick close to the Ameche.

48:45.622 --> 48:47.920
- Okay, the what?
- The telephone.

48:52.396 --> 48:55.229
- Miss Sugarpuss.
- You'd better duck.

48:55.299 --> 48:57.392
- Okay, 10:00, I'll be waiting.
- Okay, okay.

48:57.467 --> 48:59.435
- Miss Sugarpuss.
- Here I am.

48:59.503 --> 49:01.403
Just getting a little air.

49:01.471 --> 49:04.031
- Miss O'Shea.
- What's buzzing, cousin?

49:04.107 --> 49:06.507
Professor Potts would...

49:06.576 --> 49:09.443
He wishes to speak to you.

49:09.813 --> 49:11.075
- Yes.
- Yes.

49:11.148 --> 49:13.378
Don't worry, kids, cheer up.

49:13.450 --> 49:14.439
(CLICKING TONGUE)

49:14.918 --> 49:17.148
- Shut the door, please.
- Sure.

49:21.224 --> 49:24.682
- Take this chair, please, Miss O'Shea.
- This particular one?

49:24.761 --> 49:25.887
Okay.

49:29.032 --> 49:31.000
- Open your mouth, please.
- Hmm?

49:31.068 --> 49:33.536
Open your mouth. Wider.

49:34.671 --> 49:35.695
Thank you.

49:35.772 --> 49:37.330
- Can I close it now?
- Please do.

49:37.407 --> 49:38.704
- Okay.
- Miss O'Shea.

49:38.775 --> 49:39.799
Yeah?

49:39.876 --> 49:43.243
Circumstances, under, over which
neither of us has the least control,

49:43.313 --> 49:46.373
force me to a step
I am most reluctant to take.

49:47.684 --> 49:50.676
The sky is perfectly clear.
The thermometer stands at 76.

49:50.754 --> 49:53.848
Your throat seems quite normal.
I must ask you to leave.

49:53.924 --> 49:55.983
Leave here? Why?

49:56.059 --> 49:58.892
Miss O'Shea,
I want you to look at our project,

49:58.962 --> 50:02.125
I mean the encyclopedia, as a voyage,

50:02.199 --> 50:04.667
a long, hard, tedious one.

50:04.735 --> 50:06.794
A voyage from "A" to "Z."

50:06.870 --> 50:08.735
Now, when the Foundation
launched our vessel,

50:08.805 --> 50:13.265
it very wisely followed an old rule
of the sea, no women aboard.

50:13.343 --> 50:16.210
It chose a crew of single men
with nothing to distract them

50:16.279 --> 50:17.871
from the course they were to sail.

50:17.948 --> 50:21.145
Say, junior, couldn't stop
walking around a little, could you?

50:21.218 --> 50:24.346
For four days, we have been drifting,
Miss O'Shea.

50:24.421 --> 50:26.753
The needle of the compass
no longer points to the magnetic pole.

50:26.823 --> 50:29.451
It points, if I may say so, to your ankles.

50:29.526 --> 50:31.824
Come now, Admiral,
a bunch of grown men,

50:31.895 --> 50:33.886
they've seen a pair of ankles before.

50:33.964 --> 50:35.454
Not for nine years.

50:35.532 --> 50:39.525
Except for the singularly uninspiring
underpinnings of Miss Bragg.

50:39.603 --> 50:41.002
Now, my colleagues...

50:41.071 --> 50:43.301
If you think I'm bothering them,
I'll sit on my legs.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.773
- And I'll do it in my room or in the kitchen.
- Too late.

50:45.842 --> 50:49.073
- You must leave, Miss O'Shea.
- Well, I can't leave now.

50:49.146 --> 50:51.637
How about that slang?
It's not finished yet.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.615
There's a lot of words
we haven't caught up with.

50:53.683 --> 50:56.516
For instance, do you know what this
means, "I'll get you on the Ameche"?

50:56.586 --> 50:57.814
- No.
- Of course, you don't.

50:57.888 --> 50:59.253
An Ameche is the telephone.

50:59.322 --> 51:01.153
- On account of he invented it.
- Oh, no, he didn't.

51:01.224 --> 51:05.854
- You know, in the movies.
- I see what you mean. Very interesting.

51:05.996 --> 51:09.659
Make no mistake, I shall regret
the absence of your keen mind.

51:09.733 --> 51:13.794
Unfortunately, it is inseparable
from an extremely disturbing body.

51:13.870 --> 51:15.098
(WHISTLING)

51:15.172 --> 51:17.470
All right. I'll go, only don't shove.

51:17.541 --> 51:20.237
- I'll leave sometime tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow. Right away.

51:20.310 --> 51:22.437
- But I tell you I've got a...
- I insist, Miss O'Shea.

51:22.512 --> 51:23.945
Oh, Crabapple Annie.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.675
- Listen, Pottsy...
- Crabapple Annie?

51:25.749 --> 51:27.910
Why, that implies
that I'm puritanical and narrow-minded.

51:27.984 --> 51:29.008
Yeah.

51:29.086 --> 51:31.782
I am a perfectly normal man
with perfectly normal instincts.

51:31.855 --> 51:34.323
- But an awful high boiling point.
- Not even that.

51:34.391 --> 51:37.189
I, too, have been acutely aware
of your presence.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.057
- You have?
- Twice, to be exact.

51:39.129 --> 51:40.460
Once when you leaned over my shoulder

51:40.530 --> 51:42.464
to correct my spelling of
the word "boogie-woogie,"

51:42.532 --> 51:44.261
I could feel your breath on my ear.

51:44.334 --> 51:46.768
And yesterday afternoon when you
happened to stand against the window

51:46.837 --> 51:49.135
with the sunlight in your hair.

51:50.874 --> 51:54.037
- What'd you do about it?
- I left the room,

51:54.111 --> 51:55.703
dipped my handkerchief in cold water

51:55.779 --> 51:57.679
and applied it to the back of
my neck right there,

51:57.747 --> 52:00.807
- where the nerve center is.
- That's cute.

52:00.884 --> 52:03.944
You see, that's the basic difference
between me and the other professors.

52:04.020 --> 52:06.750
We are all beguiled,
but I am relatively young.

52:06.823 --> 52:08.120
I can suppress temptation.

52:08.191 --> 52:11.752
I generate enough energy
to take precautionary measures.

52:12.963 --> 52:16.421
A little sun on my hair
and you had to water your neck.

52:18.502 --> 52:20.936
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it,
Miss O'Shea,

52:21.004 --> 52:22.869
but I'm merely trying to point out the fact

52:22.939 --> 52:25.772
that the success of our enterprise
is at stake.

52:25.842 --> 52:27.901
I want you to...

52:31.748 --> 52:33.272
Cooperate.

52:33.350 --> 52:35.113
I want you to leave.

52:36.219 --> 52:38.016
All right, I'll go.

52:38.922 --> 52:42.153
But if I'm going to go anyway,
I guess I might as well spill it.

52:42.225 --> 52:44.489
Spill it? Spill what?

52:44.561 --> 52:46.324
Why do you suppose
I came here in the first place?

52:46.396 --> 52:47.454
To help with the research.

52:47.531 --> 52:49.522
- I did not. I came on account of you.
- Me?

52:49.599 --> 52:51.533
And not on account of
you needed some slang.

52:51.601 --> 52:53.296
On account of
because I wanted to see you again.

52:53.370 --> 52:55.964
Miss O'Shea, the construction
"on account of because"

52:56.039 --> 52:57.734
outrages every grammatical law.

52:57.807 --> 53:00.605
So what? I came on account of
because I couldn't stop thinking about you

53:00.677 --> 53:02.440
after you left my dressing room.

53:02.512 --> 53:07.074
On account of because I thought
you were big and cute and pretty.

53:07.150 --> 53:08.481
- Pretty?
- Yeah, I mean you.

53:08.552 --> 53:11.919
Maybe I'm just crazy, but to me,
you're a regular yum-yum type.

53:11.988 --> 53:13.979
- Yum-yum?
- Yeah, don't you know what that means?

53:14.057 --> 53:15.115
No, we never got to that.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.887
Well, we've got to it now,
and I'm glad it's out.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.689
I don't give a whoop
whether the others went for me.

53:18.762 --> 53:20.627
You're the one I'm wacky about,
just plain wacky.

53:20.697 --> 53:22.460
- Can you understand that?
- Please, Miss O'Shea.

53:22.532 --> 53:24.693
Oh, please, nothing.
Maybe you can generate or whatever it is

53:24.768 --> 53:27.032
for all that suppress business, but...

53:27.103 --> 53:29.401
I can't. No, you're too tall.

53:32.142 --> 53:33.404
- What are you doing?
- You'll find out.

53:33.476 --> 53:35.068
Those are Professor Gurkakoff's
reference books.

53:35.145 --> 53:37.204
- Now, isn't that just too bad!
- And they're very...

53:37.280 --> 53:38.872
- That's perfect.
- What are you going to do?

53:38.949 --> 53:41.713
Come here,
I'm going to show you what yum-yum is.

53:41.785 --> 53:43.150
Here's yum.

53:44.688 --> 53:46.519
Here's the other yum.

53:48.525 --> 53:50.288
And here's yum-yum.

53:54.164 --> 53:55.495
Excuse me.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.257
Hey, where are you going?

54:08.745 --> 54:11.805
Did you see?
He practically stepped on my hand.

54:11.881 --> 54:13.712
- Three steps at a time.
- Shot out of a gun.

54:13.783 --> 54:15.444
- But where is he going?
- Why?

54:15.518 --> 54:19.215
To get a razor strop, I hope,
and I hope he knows where to apply it.

54:24.160 --> 54:28.062
- Well, Professor Potts?
- Yes, Miss Bragg.

54:28.131 --> 54:31.430
Will one of you call a taxi
from the corner for Miss O'Shea?

54:32.102 --> 54:34.093
- Right away.
- Thank you.

54:40.010 --> 54:42.376
- Fine business.
- I beg your pardon?

54:42.445 --> 54:44.072
What's the idea of
running out on me like that?

54:44.147 --> 54:46.240
Nothing, nothing.

54:46.816 --> 54:49.876
The last few minutes
only confirmed my former decision.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.944
Your further presence here would be fatal.

54:52.022 --> 54:55.583
You must get me out of your mind
just as I must get you out of this house.

54:55.659 --> 54:59.026
- Your hair's wet.
- Well, never mind, please.

54:59.095 --> 55:01.586
- Well, it is wet.
- Well, what of it?

55:01.665 --> 55:02.893
Nothing, I just happened to mention it.

55:02.966 --> 55:05.560
- Well, forget it, please.
- Okay, okay.

55:06.269 --> 55:09.295
Now to get back to the subject
under discussion.

55:09.372 --> 55:12.739
It would be idle of me to deny that I, too,
feel the affinity

55:12.809 --> 55:16.176
that you mentioned a few minutes ago,
very strongly.

55:16.246 --> 55:18.111
After three years,
when my work is finished,

55:18.181 --> 55:20.979
perhaps we can take up where we left off.

55:21.051 --> 55:25.988
In the meantime, I hope we can keep up
some sort of correspondence.

55:27.223 --> 55:31.319
- Would you, Miss Sugarpuss?
- Oh, Pottsy.

55:32.629 --> 55:35.894
I know that's the way I feel, too,
but it has to be.

55:37.434 --> 55:41.768
Sugarpuss, before you go, would you...

55:44.441 --> 55:45.806
(POTTS CLEARS THROAT)

55:48.511 --> 55:49.978
Would you

55:51.514 --> 55:53.414
yum me just once more?

56:00.790 --> 56:03.486
- It seems so unnecessary.
- Yes.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.187
- Yes.
- The taxi's here.

56:05.295 --> 56:06.785
I'll tell him.

56:12.168 --> 56:15.660
Professor Potts,
the taxi for that young woman is here.

56:17.774 --> 56:19.071
The taxi.

56:20.611 --> 56:22.841
- Yes, what is it?
- The taxi's here.

56:22.913 --> 56:24.278
Taxi? What taxi?

56:25.149 --> 56:27.049
Miss O'Shea's or mine.

56:28.853 --> 56:31.219
It's all yours, Crabapple Annie.

56:35.292 --> 56:36.281
(CLICKS TONGUE)

56:53.911 --> 56:56.675
What is the delay, young man?
Delivery was promised for 10:00.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.112
Sign here.

56:58.649 --> 57:01.516
- I trust that it's engraved correctly.
- I guess so.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.849
- $39.85, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

57:03.921 --> 57:06.685
Here's $40. Keep the change.

57:11.729 --> 57:14.129
- You're sure the setting is solid gold?
- Why, of course.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.462
There was one $5 cheaper,
but not nearly so handsome.

57:16.534 --> 57:18.024
- Let's see it, Potts.
- Yes, please.

57:18.102 --> 57:20.229
No, no, it's wrapped so neatly, I hate to.

57:20.304 --> 57:22.670
- I'll take it, Miss Bragg.
- Room service.

57:22.740 --> 57:26.676
- Now we've got room service.
- I thought she might like this.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.678
- Thank you.
- It's nothing, really.

57:28.746 --> 57:30.145
Be careful.

57:32.983 --> 57:35.781
If I were the cream
for that woman's coffee, I'd curdle.

57:35.853 --> 57:38.754
I thought you meant to leave us
in protest, Miss Bragg.

57:38.823 --> 57:39.949
- Yes.
- Yes.

57:40.024 --> 57:43.983
A nurse does not quit her post
when an epidemic reaches a crisis.

57:54.503 --> 57:55.765
SUGARPUSS: Come in.

57:59.909 --> 58:03.276
- Morning, Pottsy.
- Good morning. I brought your breakfast.

58:03.345 --> 58:07.145
Good, I'll have it right here
in the snooze stand, thank you.

58:07.950 --> 58:10.441
- How do you take it?
- Just jav, no cow.

58:10.519 --> 58:12.214
- Just what?
- Black.

58:13.055 --> 58:14.750
- Sugar?
- Straight.

58:15.958 --> 58:17.721
- Toast?
- No, thanks.

58:18.661 --> 58:21.186
- You sure you don't want some toast?
- Uh-uh.

58:21.263 --> 58:23.788
Well, here's some jam to go with it.
It's blackberry.

58:23.866 --> 58:26.130
- Never use it.
- Not just one bite?

58:26.202 --> 58:27.328
Mmm-mmm.

58:28.070 --> 58:29.662
Sit down and take a load off your feet.

58:29.738 --> 58:32.138
Say, I found out what's wrong with
"on account of because."

58:32.208 --> 58:33.232
It's saying the same thing twice,

58:33.309 --> 58:35.573
you know, like calling somebody
a rich millionaire.

58:35.644 --> 58:39.671
You call it a pleo...
No, wait a minute, a plea...

58:39.748 --> 58:42.308
- A pleonasm?
- Yes, that how you pronounce it? That's it.

58:42.384 --> 58:44.318
- Who told you that?
- This room's full of books about grammar.

58:44.386 --> 58:46.047
I read for a couple of hours.

58:46.121 --> 58:47.179
I couldn't sleep, either.

58:47.256 --> 58:50.225
I walked in the park till the sun
came up over the East Sixties.

58:50.292 --> 58:52.089
It took me all that time
to gather my thoughts,

58:52.161 --> 58:55.619
to analyze my impulses
and clarify our relationship.

58:55.698 --> 58:56.824
Have we got one of those?

58:56.899 --> 58:59.663
It's a very important moment,
a new chapter.

58:59.735 --> 59:01.726
In fact, for me, it's the first chapter.

59:01.804 --> 59:06.241
For what has my life been up till now?
A preface. An empty foreword.

59:06.308 --> 59:08.435
You couldn't talk a little plainer,
could you?

59:08.510 --> 59:10.569
Not if you won't have a piece of toast.

59:10.646 --> 59:13.581
At least just... At least look under the lid.

59:17.653 --> 59:20.884
- You went and bought me a present.
- I hope it fits.

59:20.956 --> 59:24.392
Gurkakoff calculated the circumference
of your finger.

59:33.969 --> 59:36.870
I woke up the jeweler at 7:00 this morning.

59:38.407 --> 59:42.468
- It's a lovely ring, Pottsy, really it is.
- I hoped you'd like it.

59:43.679 --> 59:46.978
It's our... It's our engagement ring.

59:48.083 --> 59:52.611
- Pottsy, do you mean you...
- Yes, I did, I...

59:53.522 --> 59:55.422
You mean you really...

59:59.261 --> 01:00:00.387
Well?

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:05.491
- What am I supposed to say?
- Just say yes.

01:00:06.368 --> 01:00:10.737
After you've declared your feelings,
it's the only logical step to take.

01:00:11.907 --> 01:00:16.071
Don't you think you'd better take
another turn around the park, Pottsy?

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.275
I'm just as surprised as you.

01:00:18.347 --> 01:00:21.111
Marriage? I thought
I was married to my books.

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:23.242
The only thing
I thought I could care for deeply

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.787
was a correctly constructed sentence.

01:00:25.854 --> 01:00:31.520
The subject, predicate, adverbial clause,
each in its proper place, and then you...

01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:34.994
You see, I've had rather a curious life.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.658
I graduated from Princeton when I was 13.

01:00:37.733 --> 01:00:41.260
I recited <i>Tyger, Tyger Burning Bright</i>
when I was a year old.

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:44.135
Before I was two, I could read fluently.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.066
People like that just, well...

01:00:49.244 --> 01:00:52.736
You see, dust just piles up on their hearts.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.215
And it took you to blow it away.

01:00:56.752 --> 01:00:58.379
Yeah, but I...

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:02.115
I didn't mean
to blow it smack into your eyes.

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:06.059
Well, that's what happened, look.
Look inside the ring.

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.489
Oh, yeah, there's writing.

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:14.791
- "Richard III." Who's Richard III?
<i>- Richard III.</i>

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.101
Act 1, Scene 2, line 204.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:22.138
- There wasn't room for all the words.
- What words?

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:25.510
Well, they go like this, quote,

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:28.709
"Look, how this ring
encompasseth thy finger.

01:01:28.784 --> 01:01:32.276
"Even so thy breast
encloseth my poor heart.

01:01:32.354 --> 01:01:35.517
"Wear both of them,
for both of them are thine."

01:01:38.093 --> 01:01:39.856
Unquote, I suppose.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:44.825
I hope you don't think it's too corny.

01:01:47.169 --> 01:01:48.295
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:51.464
- Pottsy, I...
- Come in.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:55.669
- There is a telephone call for you.
- For me?

01:01:55.744 --> 01:01:59.202
We didn't want to interrupt, but the man
on the wire said it was from your daddy.

01:01:59.281 --> 01:02:01.408
- Daddy?
- That's what he said.

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:02.506
Oh.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:06.553
- Oh, yes, Daddy!
- It's long distance.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.317
Yeah, I'll get it.

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:12.022
- How did it go, Potts?
- She seemed quite overwhelmed.

01:02:12.094 --> 01:02:13.288
That was to be expected.

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:16.388
You see, excuse me,
you see, the customary procedure

01:02:16.465 --> 01:02:18.933
is to approach
the parents of the young lady first.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:21.196
- Yes.
- Yes, I realize that.

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:26.472
- Hello?
- Hello, hello, it's Asthma, Sugie.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.668
The boss wants to talk to you,

01:02:27.743 --> 01:02:30.303
only we're relaying the call
so it won't be traced, dig me?

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.210
Here she is, boss. Ready?

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.977
Okay, Sugie, don't use no names, though.

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:46.292
Oh, boy, did you call at the right minute.
Where are you?

01:02:46.361 --> 01:02:49.922
Some whistle snort in New Jersey.
Rancocas, it's called.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:53.731
Well, how you been, Sugie? I hear
you're hiding out with the seven dwarfs.

01:02:53.802 --> 01:02:56.930
Eight. And it's kind of indicated
I'd better get out of here quick.

01:02:57.005 --> 01:03:01.066
Oh, no, nothing like that, it's just that one
of the professors got off the beam a little.

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:03.668
Yeah, a slight case of Andy Hardy.

01:03:03.745 --> 01:03:08.148
Why don't you just take his umbrella
and whack him over the knuckles?

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:11.380
Well, everything's all set, babe.
The license comes through this afternoon.

01:03:11.453 --> 01:03:14.286
I got a justice of the peace all lined up.

01:03:14.756 --> 01:03:17.953
Yeah, that's what we're trying
to figure out, how to get you here.

01:03:18.026 --> 01:03:21.154
No, I don't want you to take a train.
They'd spot you like a lead dime.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.199
They'll be watching everything,
Holland Tunnel, Washington Bridge.

01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:26.097
I don't even trust the highways.

01:03:26.168 --> 01:03:28.363
I don't care
if I have to hook a ride on a hearse.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.837
I want to get out of here.
I don't like it. I want to blow.

01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:31.895
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:03:33.775 --> 01:03:36.642
Well, what other news is there, Daddy?

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:40.204
Everything fine at home? Is Mom all right?

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:48.750
For Easter? Well, I don't know, Daddy.

01:03:49.224 --> 01:03:52.489
Just a minute.
I won't be long, just wait in the library.

01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:55.428
Do you mind if I have a few words
with your father?

01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:57.725
Sure.

01:03:59.801 --> 01:04:03.601
Daddy, this is the professor
I was telling you about.

01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:11.204
Mr. O'Shea? My name is Bertram Potts.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.915
I judge your daughter has already
told you of my aspirations in her regard.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.544
Hey, are you crazy?

01:04:20.355 --> 01:04:23.347
You're quite right, Mr. O'Shea.

01:04:23.425 --> 01:04:25.154
It's inexcusable for one
to introduce oneself

01:04:25.227 --> 01:04:28.458
to one's future father-in-law
over the telephone.

01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:31.458
But before even considering

01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:33.433
entrusting your daughter's
future happiness to my care,

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:36.232
I'm sure you want to know all about me.

01:04:38.106 --> 01:04:39.698
Well, as character references,

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:42.642
you might get in touch with the head
of the Rockefeller Foundation,

01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:45.544
and the President of Princeton,
my own university.

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:50.007
Well, except for occasional trouble
with my left sinus,

01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:52.679
I am in excellent physical condition.

01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:56.654
- How's your digestion, son?
- Good.

01:04:57.492 --> 01:05:00.461
I draw a salary of $3,200 per year.

01:05:01.463 --> 01:05:04.830
In the last election,
I voted the straight Republican ticket.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.093
That's fine, that's fine.

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:11.172
I just had a brain flash, McNeary.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.237
What did you say your first name is, son?
Bertram.

01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:18.442
Well, Bertram,
I don't know if Sugarpuss told you,

01:05:18.513 --> 01:05:20.777
but she's our only child.

01:05:20.849 --> 01:05:24.080
We kind of never figured
on having a professor in the family,

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:27.053
but if that's what she wants,
then that's fine with us.

01:05:27.122 --> 01:05:30.250
Well, I shall do everything I can,
Mr. O'Shea, to make her happy.

01:05:30.325 --> 01:05:32.623
Just one thing more, Bertram.

01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:36.994
Mom is kind of an invalid,
doesn't do any traveling.

01:05:37.065 --> 01:05:39.863
But it would just break her heart
not to see Sugarpuss married.

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:42.529
- You understand that?
- Of course, sir.

01:05:42.604 --> 01:05:45.801
My mother's dead,
but I know it would have...

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:49.508
It would have made her happy
to be present.

01:05:49.978 --> 01:05:53.004
So, suppose you just bring the kid
right down here.

01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:57.177
We want to see you and
let's have the ceremony in our hometown.

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.946
Why, of course, Mr. O'Shea.

01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:03.213
May I call you Father, Mr. O'Shea?

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.126
Thank you, Father.

01:06:07.362 --> 01:06:11.389
It was better than I hoped for.
Your father wants to talk to you.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.872
Well, Sugie,
this solves your transportation.

01:06:17.939 --> 01:06:19.702
That Jack was made-to-order.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:23.677
Who's gonna stop the Rockefeller
Foundation and Princeton University?

01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:26.646
And suppose you get a couple of the other
old beavers to come along in the car.

01:06:26.715 --> 01:06:29.115
Maybe there's some other way.

01:06:29.184 --> 01:06:31.414
I don't want to take them
for that kind of a ride.

01:06:31.486 --> 01:06:33.886
That's quite all right.
I'll take a couple of days off.

01:06:33.955 --> 01:06:36.583
- Yes, we all will.
- That's a good idea.

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:40.257
Now cut out the menkenkes, Sugie.
This gets you to Rancocas.

01:06:40.328 --> 01:06:42.728
Once you're here, we'll give the professor
the boot, easy like,

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:44.857
where it won't blind him.

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:47.868
I don't want any discussions.
Just one thing.

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:52.600
Watch out for the Washington Bridge.
That'll be swarming with cops.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.008
Hello? Hello?

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:02.812
- What's the matter, my dear?
- He's always in such a rush.

01:07:02.884 --> 01:07:05.546
Which is my great good fortune,
the sooner the better.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:08.418
Gentlemen, I now have the honor
to announce our betrothal.

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:09.821
Congratulations.

01:07:09.891 --> 01:07:13.657
Very sensibly condensed,
as in the <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.959
- Please don't cry, I'm very happy.
- Can't help it.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:22.435
Look, why don't you go upstairs and
pack my fiancée's things for her? Please.

01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:25.405
- I want to be an usher.
- We'll all be ushers.

01:07:26.074 --> 01:07:28.304
One kisses the bride. May I?

01:07:28.376 --> 01:07:30.901
- We'll all kiss the bride.
- Yes, of course.

01:07:30.979 --> 01:07:33.971
- May we?
- Go ahead.

01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:40.216
We are very happy.

01:07:40.288 --> 01:07:43.451
We feel that you are marrying
all of us, a little.

01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:45.220
Yes, yes, indeed.

01:07:51.399 --> 01:07:54.027
We wish you every happiness, my dear.

01:07:56.471 --> 01:07:57.802
All of us.

01:08:01.209 --> 01:08:05.270
If we're gonna get started
this afternoon, I'd better be going.

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:12.383
(DOOR OPENING)

01:08:13.455 --> 01:08:14.547
Well.

01:08:18.393 --> 01:08:21.760
- Kind of a cheesy picture of me, isn't it?
- Recognizable, thank heaven.

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:22.956
- Wait a minute.
- Get your things together

01:08:23.031 --> 01:08:24.589
and get down the back stairs
before I call the police.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:25.758
I've got something to say.

01:08:25.834 --> 01:08:28.462
A gangster's moll thinking
she'd marry one of my professors.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.368
Don't worry,
I'm not marrying any professor.

01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:33.134
- Certainly not.
- I'm mink coat. I'm no bungalow apron.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:34.640
That's the guy I'm getting.

01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:36.870
Pretty good getting for a gal
that came up the hard way.

01:08:36.944 --> 01:08:39.435
We'll have this room fumigated
when you're out of it.

01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:40.742
- Well, you ought to, I guess.
- Let me past.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:43.376
No, no, no, any spilling that's to be done,
I'll do, but not yet.

01:08:43.451 --> 01:08:46.011
- Not while it would bug up everything.
- If you think I'll hold my tongue...

01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:48.385
Why don't you look at it this way, Braggo?
The harm's been done.

01:08:48.456 --> 01:08:51.482
Pottsy's gonna wear his heart in a sling
whether he finds out sooner or later.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.426
Here or in New Jersey
won't make any difference to him.

01:08:54.496 --> 01:08:57.055
Only, in New Jersey's
a darned sight better for me.

01:08:57.131 --> 01:08:58.258
Better for you, indeed.

01:08:58.332 --> 01:08:59.459
- No, no, no.
- Why, you, you...

01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:02.002
- Open that door or I'll scream.
- No, I can't have you screaming, not now.

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:04.595
- A piercing scream...
- Sorry, Braggo.

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:27.019
- What did you say?
- What?

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:29.893
I was just running
through the marriage service.

01:09:29.965 --> 01:09:31.261
"To be my lawful wedded wife.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:33.358
"For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer."

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.163
- Please, Pottsy.
- What?

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.703
Don't, please.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.872
You're very nervous aren't you, darling?

01:09:40.942 --> 01:09:42.603
It's been a very exciting day.

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:45.942
It's just this business of going to Jersey.
I mean, back home.

01:09:46.014 --> 01:09:49.211
Every time I get to this old bridge,
I get worried for fear I might get stuck

01:09:49.283 --> 01:09:51.081
and not be able to get back over again.

01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:53.984
We'll bring you back, don't you be afraid.

01:10:00.562 --> 01:10:02.086
Okay, go ahead.

01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:12.463
- Hey.
- Sorry, sorry.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.940
You trying to play piggy-back?

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.568
Listen to that.

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:19.512
- I don't see any reason for sarcasm.
- Neither do I.

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.254
Something wrong with your brakes,
sonny?

01:10:26.321 --> 01:10:30.189
I couldn't locate it for a moment.
This is a rented car.

01:10:30.258 --> 01:10:32.954
- Got a driver's license?
- I have, indeed.

01:10:39.901 --> 01:10:44.167
"1903."
This should have been renewed 20 times.

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.366
- This is as far as you drive, brother.
- No, no.

01:10:46.441 --> 01:10:49.308
But, Officer, this is a wedding party.

01:10:50.445 --> 01:10:51.912
A wedding party?

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.141
- Are you the bridegroom?
- No, I am.

01:10:54.215 --> 01:10:56.410
- Is this the bride?
- Yes.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:57.883
- Pardon me.
- Officer, please.

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:58.942
What is it?

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.251
It's good luck to touch a bride,
and I got a promotion coming up.

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:05.851
Well, could you reciprocate
by letting us proceed?

01:11:05.927 --> 01:11:07.417
- Yes, we'll drive very carefully.
- Yes.

01:11:07.495 --> 01:11:10.225
Postponing a wedding
is bad luck, you know, Officer.

01:11:10.298 --> 01:11:12.232
That's right.
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.892
- Get going.
- Okay.

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:15.596
A very nice gentleman.

01:11:19.107 --> 01:11:21.940
All that nonsense with my driving license.

01:11:23.144 --> 01:11:26.477
With that license I once drove
President Theodore Roosevelt.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.778
And he pronounced my driving bully.

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:29.874
(HORN HONKING)

01:11:29.951 --> 01:11:32.351
- He said that...
- Look out! Look out!

01:11:36.257 --> 01:11:38.020
Look out, look out!

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.350
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:11:40.628 --> 01:11:41.925
(PHONE RINGING)

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:47.500
(BANGING ON DOOR)

01:11:56.644 --> 01:11:58.407
Help! Help!

01:11:59.981 --> 01:12:03.417
Police! Police! Help! Help!

01:12:04.052 --> 01:12:06.145
How's that, operator? No answer.

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:07.848
- Jam it.
- Jam it.

01:12:08.356 --> 01:12:10.085
(PHONE RINGING)

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:12.582
Huh?

01:12:13.294 --> 01:12:16.559
All right, I didn't mean to say it, I'm sorry.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:18.826
Hey, wait a minute,
there's a car driving up now.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.889
(PHONE RINGING)

01:12:21.836 --> 01:12:24.202
Listen, sister, I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do?

01:12:24.272 --> 01:12:26.570
Send you a bouquet of...

01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:29.371
It's you, wait a minute.
Hey, it's Sugarpuss.

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.943
Sugie, say,
what the sweet Judas gives out?

01:12:34.015 --> 01:12:35.004
Where are you?

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:38.917
We're not down here to enjoy ourselves.
This is a wedding.

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:41.785
A what? They had an accident.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:47.484
Nothing serious.
No, it just shook the old boys up a little.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:50.529
I couldn't get to a phone before.

01:12:50.598 --> 01:12:52.828
I don't know,
some little hotel near Kingston.

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:55.199
Poplar Grove, it's called. Yeah.

01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:58.995
Oh, sure, Joe,
there's a midnight bus. I can grab that.

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.541
Midnight bus, what are you talking about?

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:03.736
I'll have Asthma and Pastrami
pick you up in about 40 minutes.

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:04.904
Sure tonight.

01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:07.140
I've got a justice of the peace on call.

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:08.978
There'll be a justice
of the peace tomorrow.

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:10.984
Now, why not do this thing right?

01:13:11.052 --> 01:13:15.284
I want to wait until the old boys go to bed.
I can't walk out on them cold.

01:13:15.356 --> 01:13:16.448
Maybe you'd like to sit down

01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.856
and knit them eight little sweaters
to remember you by.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:22.158
I've told you how it's going to be,
now stop barking orders.

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:23.458
So long.

01:13:27.168 --> 01:13:28.863
Get the car ready.

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:33.066
GURKAKOFF: I could prove to you
by the laws of relativity

01:13:33.141 --> 01:13:36.372
that it was not I who ran into the signpost,

01:13:36.444 --> 01:13:38.639
but that it was the signpost which ran...

01:13:38.713 --> 01:13:41.113
That's all right, go ahead, sit down.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:45.144
But that it was the signpost
which ran into me.

01:13:46.554 --> 01:13:47.680
Let me explain.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:51.816
If you do, by that same law,
your head will run into this bottle.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.357
- Before you do that, I'd like a drink, please.
- By all means, excuse me.

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.194
No, I think I'll hit the hay, get some sleep.

01:13:58.266 --> 01:14:00.097
- Why?
- The evening's young yet.

01:14:00.168 --> 01:14:02.568
Oh, no, I don't belong here.
This is a bachelor dinner.

01:14:02.637 --> 01:14:04.969
- But this one is different.
- No, that's the law.

01:14:05.039 --> 01:14:07.473
We've heard from the garage.
The car will be ready in the morning.

01:14:07.542 --> 01:14:09.476
Perhaps it will hold together
until Rancocas.

01:14:09.544 --> 01:14:10.602
Then we'll be leaving early.

01:14:10.678 --> 01:14:15.342
Yeah, after issuing an urgent appeal
to all signposts not to charge at us.

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:16.574
That's right.

01:14:16.651 --> 01:14:17.777
What...

01:14:17.852 --> 01:14:20.116
What time shall we waken you,
about 7:30?

01:14:20.188 --> 01:14:22.213
I'll be awake all right.

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:26.093
Well, kids, here's to you.

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:28.857
- Here's to you.
- Here's to all of us.

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.056
Yes, to all of us.

01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:36.502
Pottsy, I...

01:14:38.706 --> 01:14:41.174
You know,
you boys still have time to warn him.

01:14:41.242 --> 01:14:44.370
- A man is a goof to marry any woman.
- Just let them try to warn me.

01:14:44.445 --> 01:14:48.074
He'll have to console us that
there aren't seven more just like you.

01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:51.846
- Yeah, one for each of us.
- Of assorted ages, of course.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.251
Naturally.

01:14:53.821 --> 01:14:54.810
I...

01:14:55.857 --> 01:14:56.846
Well, I...

01:14:57.425 --> 01:15:00.360
I'd like to keep you all in a locket, always.

01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:04.125
Eight squirrelly cherubs
right out of this world.

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:08.630
- Bye, kids.
- Good night.

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.096
Goodnight.

01:15:10.171 --> 01:15:12.731
Did you hear, Potts?
I'm a squirrelly cherub.

01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:36.592
No, no, no.
No, I insist, the happiest marriages

01:15:36.664 --> 01:15:38.894
are those which produce three children

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:42.232
at intervals of not less than two
or more than three years.

01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:46.203
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:50.138
You are all speaking very glibly
about a subject

01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:52.475
of which you know practically nothing.

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.742
No, I know what I'm saying.

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:59.810
If you feel the need of any guidance,
may I suggest that you turn to me.

01:15:59.887 --> 01:16:01.752
That's right.
You were married, weren't you?

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:06.556
Oh, yes. Genevieve has been dead
for some 24 years but...

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:10.530
I have relived every moment
of our happiness so many times.

01:16:10.598 --> 01:16:13.726
And my experience
is entirely at your disposal, Bertram.

01:16:13.801 --> 01:16:15.029
Thank you, Oddly, but I really...

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:20.666
I judge I do not have to start
with basic principles.

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:23.305
Being...

01:16:23.678 --> 01:16:27.114
Being a botanist,
I find an astonishing parallel

01:16:27.181 --> 01:16:30.810
between a woman's heart
and the wind flower

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:33.149
or <i>Anemone nemorosa.</i>

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:37.157
Perhaps you know the plant,
how it waits for the warm sunshine

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:41.821
and soft winds before it unfolds its petals.

01:16:42.897 --> 01:16:44.489
Sensitive and delicate.

01:16:44.565 --> 01:16:48.968
One rough, impetuous bee
can completely destroy the bloom.

01:16:49.103 --> 01:16:51.230
Come out of the garden, will you, Oddly?

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.568
- Jerome.
- Have a heart.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.834
I'm much obliged to you, Oddly, but I...

01:16:53.908 --> 01:16:58.106
Please, please, Bertram.
Think of me as an elder brother

01:16:58.179 --> 01:17:02.548
or father, anxious to send you off properly.

01:17:03.117 --> 01:17:05.347
As we all are. Of course.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.684
Now, tenderness,

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:12.553
that is what I advocate.
Tenderness and patience.

01:17:13.961 --> 01:17:16.020
Genevieve was a watercolorist.

01:17:16.097 --> 01:17:20.693
Therefore, after the wedding reception,
we went straight to the Catskills.

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:28.640
We spent there a beautiful week
filled with promise.

01:17:29.377 --> 01:17:32.972
And returned to New York
with 14 excellent watercolors.

01:17:33.614 --> 01:17:35.047
Fourteen watercolors.

01:17:35.116 --> 01:17:39.416
Back in New York, I flung my enthusiasm
into preparing a lecture,

01:17:39.487 --> 01:17:41.717
"The Flora of the Catskills,"

01:17:41.789 --> 01:17:44.519
whilst Genevieve painted
a flight of swallows

01:17:44.592 --> 01:17:47.117
around the walls of our living room.

01:17:47.695 --> 01:17:48.889
Ah, me.

01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:54.459
I remember for three months,
every time I bade her goodnight

01:17:54.535 --> 01:17:57.732
I would kiss the palm of her little hand,

01:17:57.805 --> 01:18:00.638
astonished at my own boldness.

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:02.699
What did you say
the name of the flower was?

01:18:02.777 --> 01:18:06.269
<i>Anemone nemorosa,</i>
of the buttercup family.

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:10.709
Genevieve was a blonde.

Here is a lock of her hair.

01:18:15.022 --> 01:18:16.489
- Very lovely.
- Yes.

01:18:16.557 --> 01:18:19.526
I remember, it used to shine a great deal.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:23.121
And there was a song at that time
everyone sang.

01:18:23.798 --> 01:18:26.562

Robinson, what did you make
of what Oddly was saying?

01:20:36.564 --> 01:20:38.759
Don't ask me, Potts. He's the expert.

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:42.269
- What's his bungalow number?
- I don't know. Ask Peagram.

01:20:42.336 --> 01:20:45.134
Peagram, what's the number
of Oddly's bungalow?

01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:46.605
He's in six.

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:11.925
Oddly?

01:21:14.235 --> 01:21:15.998
I'm sorry, Oddly,
but I've got to talk this out.

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:19.267
I must get this off my chest
before it stifles me.

01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:21.831
If you don't mind,
we won't turn on the light

these things extremely personal.

01:21:25.179 --> 01:21:26.976
What you said,

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:30.814
I recognize the beauty and delicacy
of the relationship you described.

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:33.353
But I'm... I don't trust myself.

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:36.185
I'm afraid
I'm a lot bolder than you are, Oddly.

01:21:36.257 --> 01:21:39.124
You don't think that would necessarily
endanger everything? Do you?

01:21:39.193 --> 01:21:42.685
Why, the very idea that I should
have to spend my honeymoon

01:21:42.763 --> 01:21:44.731
watching her paint in watercolors

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:48.565
just because she's like somebody
from the buttercup family, I...

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.895
I'm a man in love.
It's the first time in my life.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.907
I want to take her in my arms.

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:58.139
I thought because I was young,
I had self-control but that's not true.

01:21:58.212 --> 01:22:00.476
I think of her every waking moment.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:03.415
Why, if this marriage had been delayed,
I mean, should have been delayed,

01:22:03.484 --> 01:22:05.281
I mean, should be...

01:22:06.053 --> 01:22:09.113
Listen to that.
Oddly, I don't know my tenses anymore.

- What...

I'm sorry, I don't know
how I could have made such a mistake.

01:22:30.344 --> 01:22:34.075
To say such things to a woman.
You'll have to forgive me.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.742
Don't apologize, Pottsy.

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.482

- Somebody is calling me.
- Are they?

Maybe it's just as well.

- Professor Potts!

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.162

- Potts.

- So you're the bridegroom?

- Yes. This is Professor Potts.
- How are you, Bertram?

- Yeah.

- It's about Sugarpuss.

- Perhaps if we talked to him...
- There's been too many detours as is.

you guys delivered a hot cargo.

She was to be handled with care.

- Potts, it seems that your bride to be...
- His bride. That's a laugh.

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:38.026
It seems that Sugarpuss has used us
to circumvent the police.

- We serving as protective coloration.
- PROFESSOR: Yes.

Professor, you really thought
she was going to marry you

with your $3,000 what-was-it a year?

She spends that much
for having her toenails painted.

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:53.775
She sulks if she has to wear
last year's ermine.

He don't believe it. Look at him.

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:03.381

- Thanks for what?

You've given us all a fine course in
the theory and practice of being a sucker.

It was a very small tuition fee.

01:27:24.171 --> 01:27:26.366

of you choosing us

- Good morning, gentlemen.

I made some Parker House rolls.

- Even have some jam.

Before we attempt to get back to work,
I'd like to say a few words.

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:17.180
You've been very kind and very tactful.
If I may say so, over-tactful.

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.717
The entire ride home in the car,

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:23.553
you avoided a certain subject
and made empty conversation.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:26.491
Now, let's have it out.
I made an ass of myself and I know it.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.585
Oh, well, we all have, Potts.

01:29:28.662 --> 01:29:30.823
Yes, but I was the lead donkey.

01:29:31.398 --> 01:29:36.028
Why not just regard the episode
as a prolonged constitutional?

01:29:36.103 --> 01:29:38.196
That's right. That's what we'll do.

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:39.296
Thank you.

What happened to our emotions
can't be undone.

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.604
What happened to our work
must be remedied.

01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:49.775
I'm sorry, but because of me
we must work two extra hours a day.

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:51.442
In a month,
we'll be back on schedule again.

01:29:51.518 --> 01:29:52.712
- Sure.
- That's right.

01:29:52.786 --> 01:29:54.344
Now, we are all scholars.

01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:57.049
Let us withdraw behind our wall of books,

01:29:57.124 --> 01:30:00.355
and may her name never
be brought up in this house again.

01:30:00.427 --> 01:30:04.363
- We didn't mention it, Potts.
- Not even by omitting it so obviously.

01:30:04.431 --> 01:30:07.059
Excuse me, Bertram, but...

01:30:07.134 --> 01:30:10.626
Well, now that
we are burying her memory,

01:30:10.704 --> 01:30:15.300
I feel it only fair, you see,
she gave me something for you.

01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:20.972
I found her crying in her bungalow,
and she slipped your ring into my pocket.

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.743
Put it in the wastebasket, please, Oddly.

01:30:22.816 --> 01:30:24.545
(STUTTERING) Just a moment.
Just a moment.

01:30:24.618 --> 01:30:28.384
- Is this your ring, Potts?
- That for $39.85?

01:30:28.455 --> 01:30:31.481
- Doesn't look like it.
- Why, no it is not.

01:30:31.558 --> 01:30:33.526
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:30:34.461 --> 01:30:40.093
Because if this is the one she gave
back to you and not the one you gave her,

01:30:41.268 --> 01:30:42.565
it's enormously interesting.

01:30:42.636 --> 01:30:45.196

- Why? How so?

01:30:46.473 --> 01:30:48.100

- She loves you.
- How can you say that?

01:30:50.377 --> 01:30:52.538
Please, she happened
to pull that one off by mistake.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:55.081
- Not according to Professor Freud.
- Freud?

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:57.982
The subconscious mind
never makes mistakes.

01:30:58.819 --> 01:31:02.152
She gave you the ring she didn't want,
his ring.

01:31:03.023 --> 01:31:06.857
And she kept the one she wanted, yours.

01:31:06.927 --> 01:31:10.727
- That's right, Potts.
- Bosh and nonsense.

01:31:10.797 --> 01:31:12.321
I agree with Miss Bragg.

01:31:12.399 --> 01:31:15.300
I refuse to be coddled with
a lot of psychoanalytical nonsense.

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:18.270
As one who understands a woman's heart,
I would like to...

Quite an eventful night
last night, gentlemen.

01:31:25.979 --> 01:31:27.344
At least, so we see by the papers.

01:31:28.515 --> 01:31:32.110
We're quite fresh this morning, however.
And we're going back to work with a will.

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:33.813
- Yes, indeed.
- There's no hurry about that.

01:31:33.887 --> 01:31:36.720
- Not any longer.
- We've had quite enough of your activities.

to at last have its name

01:31:42.429 --> 01:31:45.193
"Night club babe hides out
in Totten Foundation."

01:31:45.265 --> 01:31:47.165
- And this one.
- Yes.

01:31:47.868 --> 01:31:50.666
"Professor bridegroom carries
ball of fire across state line."

01:31:50.737 --> 01:31:52.534
And many others like it.

01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:57.202
For my father, I feel profound humiliation.
For myself, unutterable disgust.

01:31:57.277 --> 01:31:58.938
- Shall I go ahead?
- Please.

01:31:59.012 --> 01:32:00.445
For the aforesaid reasons,

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.607
Miss Totten has decided
to discontinue the encyclopedia.

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:03.741
What?

01:32:03.817 --> 01:32:05.842
- How soon can you vacate?
- Vacate? After nine years?

01:32:05.919 --> 01:32:08.012
- Expelled in disgrace?
- Pull the chair from under us?

01:32:08.088 --> 01:32:10.215
Thrown out like eight old shoes?

01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:13.020
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but my mind's made up.

01:32:13.093 --> 01:32:14.321
Go ahead, Mr. Larsen.

01:32:14.394 --> 01:32:16.385
Several real estate firms
are interested in this property.

01:32:16.463 --> 01:32:19.489
One of the companies wants to erect
an apartment house here, giving you...

01:32:19.566 --> 01:32:20.794
Whoa! Please don't do that.

01:32:20.867 --> 01:32:22.198
I'm sorry.

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:25.363
One word, Miss Totten, may I?

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:29.000
In your very understandable excitement,
a great injustice is being done.

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.236
I am the guilty one.

01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:33.336
And I accept my dishonorable discharge
without protest,

01:32:33.413 --> 01:32:36.075
but that others should suffer
and be punished

01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:38.583
(STAMMERING) for my misconduct
is unthinkable.

01:32:38.652 --> 01:32:40.051
(WINDOW BREAKS)

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.452
Oh, my goodness, what was that?

01:32:46.893 --> 01:32:48.656
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:52.165
Everybody line up over there,
like for a photograph.

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:55.833
With you, Bertram, in the foreground.

01:32:55.902 --> 01:32:57.426
Come on, get going.

01:32:57.504 --> 01:33:00.871
Get around, get around. Go on.
Faster. Keep moving.

01:33:02.242 --> 01:33:06.542
Saint Valentine's Day!

01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:26.262
Is the bride ready yet?

01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:28.198
- No, not yet.
- What?

01:33:28.969 --> 01:33:32.837
- Louder, please.
- We're still talking it over.

01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:34.931
Good idea. Important step.

01:33:36.209 --> 01:33:39.701
- Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?
- For lunch. Five minutes late.

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:43.773
- When are you going to be back?
- After I've ate and had my nap.

01:33:44.384 --> 01:33:46.784
How long are we gonna argue this?

01:33:47.454 --> 01:33:50.753
- Now look, Sugie.
- I said no. And no is no.

01:33:50.824 --> 01:33:53.952
Sugie, when I was nine years old,
I was in love with my piano teacher.

01:33:54.027 --> 01:33:56.825
She played classical.
You're not nine years old.

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:57.886
I love him.

01:33:57.964 --> 01:34:00.432
- She loves him.
- Yes, I love him.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.594
I love those hick shirts he wears
with the boiled cuffs.

01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:05.831
And the way he always has
his vest buttoned wrong.

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:08.374
Looks like a giraffe and I love him.

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:09.841
I love him because he's the kind of a guy

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:12.902
that gets drunk on a glass of buttermilk.

01:34:12.979 --> 01:34:16.380
And I love the way
he blushes right up over his ears.

01:34:17.617 --> 01:34:21.212
I love him because he doesn't know
how to kiss, the jerk.

01:34:22.022 --> 01:34:25.185
I love him, Joe.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:34:25.258 --> 01:34:27.249
I'll never see him again.

01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:30.294
But I'm not gonna marry you.

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:32.491
Not if you tie a ton of cement
around my neck

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:35.091
and throw me into the East River
like you did to all the others.

01:34:35.168 --> 01:34:36.999
- I tell you, Joe was framed.
- Oh, sure, sure.

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:39.504
So you tell me, I know better now.

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:43.036
I guess she'd better talk to her professor.
Get him on the phone.

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:44.668
You leave him out of this.

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:47.236
Imagine that big giraffe
at the bottom of the East River.

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:49.578
You wouldn't like that to happen
to him, would you, Sugarpuss?

01:34:49.649 --> 01:34:52.083
- That ain't funny, McGee.
- Who said it's funny?

01:34:52.152 --> 01:34:53.744
I mean business.

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.854
That is if you don't say "I do"
like a nice little bride.

01:34:56.923 --> 01:34:57.912
Uh-uh.

01:34:58.492 --> 01:35:01.893
I kind of figured you'd bumped your brains
into one of them pink clouds.

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:04.726
- You can't do this, Joe.
- It's too late, Sugie.

01:35:04.798 --> 01:35:07.528
- The pressure's on already.
- What is this? Putting the screws on me?

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.933
You said it,
and right where it'll do the most good.

01:35:10.003 --> 01:35:12.699
- Neighborhood of the heart.
- Hello.

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:15.435
This is McNeary. Hang on. Here you are.

01:35:16.376 --> 01:35:17.775
You take it.

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.014
- Hello?
- Hello, Sugie.

01:35:25.185 --> 01:35:26.948
Sure, it's Pastrami.

01:35:29.055 --> 01:35:30.989
Just dropped in on the boys,
Asthma and me,

01:35:31.057 --> 01:35:33.389
with our little old typewriters.

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:36.090
That's up to the boss.
We're waiting for orders.

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:40.094
- For orders?
- Can we make a deal now, Sugie?

01:35:40.834 --> 01:35:45.362
Sure we can, brother.
Put him on, Pastrami, just a word.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.370
Would you mind stepping
to the phone, Professor Potts?

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:51.638
A lady friend of yours.

01:35:51.711 --> 01:35:54.339
I have nothing to say to Miss O'Shea.

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:58.576
- Oh, please, please!
- You haven't?

01:35:58.652 --> 01:35:59.641
Just a moment.

01:35:59.719 --> 01:36:01.380
Goodness, this is awful.
Yesterday, a nightclub...

01:36:01.455 --> 01:36:03.116
Shut your clam, sister.

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.350
Hello.

01:36:05.158 --> 01:36:08.286
Yes, Miss O'Shea, this is Professor Potts.

01:36:08.361 --> 01:36:10.226
Your friends are here.

01:36:10.864 --> 01:36:13.856
Not at all.
Your methods are familiar by now.

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:16.494
I don't know the exact purpose
of this maneuver.

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:19.038
What more can be gained from us?

01:36:19.105 --> 01:36:21.573
But I hope
that it works to your advantage.

01:36:22.642 --> 01:36:25.702
I'm sorry, Pottsy,
but it'll be all right in a little while.

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:30.478
They won't hurt anybody.
Just don't do anything foolish.

01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:32.643
- Promise me, Pottsy.
- Give it.

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:38.615
Okay, Bertram, put Pastrami back on.

01:36:39.259 --> 01:36:41.727
I imagine he wants to talk to you.

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:44.027
Yes, boss?

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:49.567
Okay, we'll wait for the call.
And best wishes, boss. Congratulations.

01:36:51.271 --> 01:36:55.002
Well, all we have to do
is to wait for the all-clear signal.

01:36:56.009 --> 01:36:59.342
We'll dismiss the class
right after the ceremony.

01:36:59.412 --> 01:37:02.973
- Did you say after the ceremony?
- That's what I said.

01:37:03.049 --> 01:37:04.448
You mean they're not married yet?

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:06.349
Why do you think
we're futzing around with these?

01:37:06.419 --> 01:37:07.545
Well, I don't know, I thought...

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:11.648
A little trouble with Sugarpuss'
vocal chords. Wouldn't say yes.

01:37:12.025 --> 01:37:14.516
She wouldn't say yes? What...

01:37:14.594 --> 01:37:16.027
You very ugly young man,

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.826
you know, to me at this moment
you look perfectly delightful?

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:20.457
- I mean absolutely beautiful.
- I what?

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:22.058
- Positively wonderful.
- Are you nuts?

01:37:22.135 --> 01:37:24.296
(LAUGHING) No, I feel like yodeling.

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:25.360
(YODELING)

01:37:26.873 --> 01:37:28.135
Pardon me.

01:37:28.208 --> 01:37:32.008
Dr. Gurkakoff,
my apologies to Professor Freud.

01:37:32.078 --> 01:37:33.340
Thank you.

01:37:33.413 --> 01:37:36.109
But you don't understand.
This visit is no longer a mystery.

01:37:36.182 --> 01:37:37.877
Apparently, it requires those two guns

01:37:37.951 --> 01:37:40.852
leveled on us
to force Sugarpuss to marry Mr. Lilac.

01:37:41.087 --> 01:37:42.520
- You mean to say that...
- Yes.

01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:45.615
- That explains everything.
- Break it up, break it up.

01:37:45.692 --> 01:37:47.523
- We can't allow that.
- No, no, indeed.

01:37:47.594 --> 01:37:49.186
Can't, huh?
What do you think we're here for?

01:37:49.262 --> 01:37:53.255
But, young man, you see,
we all love this young lady very dearly.

01:37:53.333 --> 01:37:55.233
Better look out. It's gonna spit.

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:56.963
What is going to... Oh, dear.

01:37:57.037 --> 01:38:00.404
- Now, sit down, all of you. Sit down.
- Yes, we're... I mean, we're...

01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.404
Ah.

01:38:08.481 --> 01:38:11.712
Don't look so big now,
them eight big brains.

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.548
Not to me they don't.

01:38:14.988 --> 01:38:16.615
You are under the impression
that you are big

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:17.850
because you have those firearms

01:38:17.924 --> 01:38:20.654
because you know how to load them
and pull the trigger.

01:38:20.727 --> 01:38:23.161
It would be interesting
to teach them the contrary...

01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:25.254
Button it up, understand?

01:38:27.267 --> 01:38:30.031
Hey, fellows, this won't take a second.

01:38:30.103 --> 01:38:32.298
They're pulling a double or nothing
on that quizzola.

01:38:32.372 --> 01:38:35.068
Three new questions. First.

01:38:35.141 --> 01:38:37.905
"The sword of Damocles, was that a..."

01:38:39.212 --> 01:38:41.009
Say, was you holding a meeting
or something?

01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:43.049
More like a wake, maybe.

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:49.215
- Excuse me.
- Just a minute, Jack.

01:38:49.789 --> 01:38:53.247
We got a loge seat for you,
right in the back row.

01:38:53.326 --> 01:38:54.918
This way, please.

01:39:01.267 --> 01:39:02.734
That's right.

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:05.427
ASTHMA: Now, sit down.

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:27.751
Young man, your...
You don't mind if we talk, do you?

01:39:27.827 --> 01:39:30.125
- PASTRAMl: Just keep it funny.
- Thank you.

01:39:30.797 --> 01:39:35.063
Your question as you came in was about
the sword of Damocles, I believe.

01:39:35.368 --> 01:39:36.426
Yeah.

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:39.063
- But I'd just as soon skip it.
- No, but it's a very interesting subject.

01:39:39.139 --> 01:39:41.334
- Never mind.
- Yeah, but I do mind.

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:44.840
I just wanted to tell you
that the sword of Damocles

01:39:44.911 --> 01:39:46.606
was suspended over his head.

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.114
- Yes, by a single hair.
- Exactly.

01:39:49.215 --> 01:39:53.549
Did you hear that, Robinson?
Suspended over his head by a single hair.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.850
A constant source of danger.

01:39:55.922 --> 01:39:58.982
Mr. Pastrami,
you know your history, don't you?

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:04.187
It's not one of my best points.
I never went in for that kind of stuff.

01:40:04.864 --> 01:40:08.391
- At least, not very much.
- Well, I thought I'd just ask you.

01:40:08.468 --> 01:40:11.494
- A very interesting lesson indeed.
- Yes.

01:40:12.205 --> 01:40:16.574
Yes, indeed. I've always found it
a most absorbing subject.

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:19.134
But Mr. Totten is not suspended by a hair.

01:40:19.212 --> 01:40:20.770
(SHUSHING)

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.379
ASTHMA: Uh-uh.

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:25.976
No secrets, boys, talk upstairs.

01:40:26.052 --> 01:40:28.782
- I thought you'd see it.
- Don't you agree, Dr. Gurkakoff?

01:40:28.855 --> 01:40:31.187
- What did you say?
- I said, don't you agree?

01:40:31.257 --> 01:40:35.751
Yes, yes, yes. A danger very often
overhangs the unsuspecting.

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:37.194
What kind of jive is that?

01:40:37.263 --> 01:40:39.823
If you're gonna talk, talk so we can dig it.

01:40:39.899 --> 01:40:42.265
Oh, I'm sorry. We'll try.

01:40:42.335 --> 01:40:44.496
- Dr. Gurkakoff?
- Yeah?

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:47.563
What was that about
the Roman fleet and Archimedes?

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.700
I don't remember.
You know, it's not exactly...

01:40:50.777 --> 01:40:53.803
Why, he set it afire
with the use of reflectors.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.008
You can talk just as well sitting down,
can't you?

01:40:57.083 --> 01:40:58.641
Yes, yes.

01:40:59.352 --> 01:41:02.617
POTTS: I find that vastly instructive,
don't you, Dr. Gurkakoff?

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:04.589
Extremely enlightening.

01:41:05.892 --> 01:41:08.690
- Potts, you were saying...
- Yes.

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:11.128
Now if I... May I stand?

01:41:11.197 --> 01:41:14.894
- Sure, if it's gonna help.
- Thank you, it will a lot.

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:18.267
Now, if I may have your attention
for a few moments.

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:21.330
Gentlemen,
you see your inferiority is a question

01:41:21.407 --> 01:41:23.637
of the bony structure of your skulls.

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:27.237
- What's the matter with our skulls?
- Now, just listen, please.

01:41:27.313 --> 01:41:29.372
Let us take
the glandular syncopation of your eyes.

01:41:29.449 --> 01:41:31.849
Kindly look at me, both of you.
It's very important.

01:41:31.918 --> 01:41:34.614
They are the doliocephalic and
the brachiocephalic

01:41:34.687 --> 01:41:36.985

Mediterranean estrafuge.

01:41:37.056 --> 01:41:38.785
Now try to follow me closely.

01:41:38.858 --> 01:41:42.817
Now, the double smorgasbord
of your chins, for instance,

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:45.694
convexing into
the cataclysmic protoplasm...

01:41:46.766 --> 01:41:48.358
Am I boring you?

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:53.504
- I don't get it.
- Now, the latest centrifugal research

01:41:53.573 --> 01:41:57.509
as performed by
Bronxville scientists has proven

01:41:57.577 --> 01:42:02.173
that syllogism is enigmatic to prolonged
resistance, especially in the cavalry.

01:42:02.248 --> 01:42:05.217
Now take your ears.

extricated from the paranoiac agriculture

01:42:09.956 --> 01:42:12.447
- and molecular cadenzas...
- Get down to it.

01:42:12.525 --> 01:42:15.289
- What's wrong with us?
- Nothing.

01:42:16.996 --> 01:42:19.464
You're just fine. Everything's fine.

01:42:19.532 --> 01:42:22.160
Now, on one hand
we have the sword of Damocles,

01:42:22.235 --> 01:42:24.567
and on the other hand we have...

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:27.134
Professor Quintana,
would you look up something

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:28.765
in Tate's <i>Oriental Philosophy</i> for me?

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:31.834
- I think I saw it last on your desk.
- Yes, yes.

01:42:32.745 --> 01:42:35.145
- Line one, chapter seven.
- Yes.

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:36.580
Do you mind?

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:39.942
Hey, this mixed-up talk
is giving me a headache.

01:42:40.019 --> 01:42:43.079
All that book talk. That's a lot of mahaha.

01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:45.317
I assure you this is not a lot of mahaha.
This is...

01:42:45.391 --> 01:42:47.916
I'll show you
what makes the world go round.

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:50.919
Kind of spread out a little bit, will you?

01:42:55.568 --> 01:42:58.731
- My globe! My globe!
- Me, I don't like globes.

01:43:00.373 --> 01:43:01.635
Now me.

01:43:06.112 --> 01:43:08.307
I saw me a picture last week.

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.951
There's gonna be a lot
of trash tomorrow, sister.

01:43:23.029 --> 01:43:25.122

- Young man.
- What do you want?

Do you think you could shoot this dime

01:44:01.167 --> 01:44:04.796

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:07.504

All right, put it up.

01:44:28.861 --> 01:44:32.991
- Perhaps we'd better use a quarter.
- Well, that's twice as easy.

Never mind, never mind.
