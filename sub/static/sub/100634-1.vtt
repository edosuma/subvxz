WEBVTT

01:33.735 --> 01:36.470
Well now that makes
even less sense.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.241
I'm not stupid. You're stupid.

01:53.355 --> 01:54.688
Doctor?

01:55.757 --> 01:57.424
Doctor.

01:57.426 --> 01:59.292
Movie night's
officially underway.

01:59.294 --> 02:00.660
Come on, let's go.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.195
Your Cantonese chow mein's
getting cold.

02:04.366 --> 02:06.032
Come on!

02:09.838 --> 02:11.438
Okay.

02:13.609 --> 02:16.510
So, what movie
are we watching?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.380
Oh, come on.
You had one job...

02:20.382 --> 02:21.781
pick the movie!

02:21.783 --> 02:23.683
I know but I'm closer
than I thought.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.051
The Higgs Boson

02:25.053 --> 02:26.319
perpetuating
the Higgs Singlet...

02:26.321 --> 02:27.621
No, no, no.
No, remember,

02:27.623 --> 02:29.723
we said no dirty talk
on movie night.

02:29.725 --> 02:31.057
No.

02:31.994 --> 02:33.360
Okay, okay, fine.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.861
A little bit of time travel
theory dirty talk,

02:34.863 --> 02:36.162
but no equations.

02:36.164 --> 02:37.864
Okay, so you know
how I originally thought

02:37.866 --> 02:39.499
I needed
a particle accelerator

02:39.501 --> 02:41.401
operating at 40 TeV
to test my theories.

02:41.403 --> 02:42.903
Oh, boy. Do I ever.

02:42.905 --> 02:44.404
'Kay but I think with
a few more adjustments

02:44.406 --> 02:46.172
I could get it
to work at 20.

02:46.174 --> 02:49.009
Yeah but see, the Large Hadron
Collider only goes to 13.

02:49.011 --> 02:50.310
Get it down to that
and I'll hook you up

02:50.312 --> 02:51.678
once I get that job at CERN.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.179
I... I just don't understand

02:53.181 --> 02:54.981
why you wanna go
all the way to Switzerland.

02:54.983 --> 02:57.384
I don't know why you won't
apply for a job there.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.519
No one has a bigger hard-on
for the LHC than you do.

02:59.521 --> 03:01.388
'Cause Dr. Rowley's here.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.490
But she doesn't even have
a particle accelerator!

03:03.492 --> 03:06.026
Why do you care so much if
I move to Switzerland anyway?

03:06.028 --> 03:07.260
Hmm?

03:08.997 --> 03:10.430
I don't. I don't care.

03:10.432 --> 03:11.498
Great.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.732
Yeah. Go. Enjoy.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.034
- I will go.
- Go to Switzerland...

03:14.036 --> 03:15.402
- I am going.
- Enjoy the mountains...

03:15.404 --> 03:17.170
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- ...and the chocolates

03:17.172 --> 03:20.440
and the little army knives
and mysterious bank accounts.

03:20.442 --> 03:22.576
Enjoy.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.778
Oh my god.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.845
What are you doing?

03:25.847 --> 03:28.615
Oh, I am taking mine to go.

03:28.617 --> 03:30.517
But what about...
what about movie night?

03:31.954 --> 03:33.620
The only reason why
you came out of the garage

03:33.622 --> 03:36.089
is because you're literally
starving and I had food.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.024
I'm not literally starving.
Meredith made me pancakes.

03:38.026 --> 03:39.059
You know what?

03:39.061 --> 03:40.393
Don't worry about it.

03:40.395 --> 03:41.795
- We'll just do it tomorrow night.
- Ah...

03:41.797 --> 03:43.597
And don't try to tell me
that you have plans,

03:43.599 --> 03:46.099
because the only person that you
could possibly have plans with

03:46.101 --> 03:47.867
is currently
standing in front of you

03:47.869 --> 03:50.270
giving you a lecture about
how you don't have any plans.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.606
Don't stay up late.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.341
I'll pick you up
for work at 8:00.

04:03.652 --> 04:06.052
Honest to God, bro.

04:06.054 --> 04:07.621
Hey, if you're not gonna
date Courtney, can I?

04:07.623 --> 04:09.489
I'm right in the middle
of something here, okay?

04:09.491 --> 04:12.659
Absolutely. Super, super-duper
important science stuff, right?

04:12.661 --> 04:13.994
Mm-hm.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.131
Gotcha.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.107
Hey, so, I thought
that you'd like to know

04:27.109 --> 04:29.576
that tomorrow
is the 15th anniversary.

04:29.578 --> 04:31.778
I know what day it is.

04:31.780 --> 04:35.248
Right, so, I thought
that we should...

04:35.250 --> 04:36.816
spread the ashes.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.319
I really don't think this is
the right year for that.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.854
Mm-hm, but you've been
saying that every year

04:40.856 --> 04:42.622
- since the tenth anniversary.
- I feel like it's more of

04:42.624 --> 04:43.857
a 20th anniversary
sort of thing,

04:43.859 --> 04:45.425
you know,
a nice round number.

04:45.427 --> 04:47.794
Yeah but it's gonna suck
whenever we do it, James,

04:47.796 --> 04:48.862
whether it's...

04:51.266 --> 04:54.668
...then or now, so we...

04:56.638 --> 04:57.671
James.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.539
Another time.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.877
James.

05:03.879 --> 05:06.112
Fine.

05:06.114 --> 05:07.681
Fine. I'll...

05:07.683 --> 05:10.450
I'll meet you there
tomorrow after work, okay?

05:13.488 --> 05:14.921
Okay.

05:16.725 --> 05:19.392
Hey.

05:19.394 --> 05:21.127
I think I'm gonna be up
for a while.

05:21.129 --> 05:23.697
Can you please make me
a cup of coffee, please?

05:23.699 --> 05:26.332
Dude, you have a PhD in
experimental particle things.

05:26.334 --> 05:27.867
Physics.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.470
It's hot water filtered
through coffee grinds,

05:30.472 --> 05:33.106
that's it. Jesus fuck, man.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.069
Hey.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.404
Check out that sky tonight?

06:06.441 --> 06:08.708
You can see the constellation
Equuleus.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.110
It's a small horse.

06:10.112 --> 06:12.912
No, thank you.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.947
All right.

06:13.949 --> 06:18.351
Hey, you like Delta blues?

06:18.353 --> 06:21.955
Oh, nothing gets me through the
night like a little Delta blues.

06:21.957 --> 06:23.223
Oh-ho!

06:23.225 --> 06:24.457
Bom-bom, bow.

06:26.128 --> 06:27.460
I'm so sorry.

06:27.462 --> 06:28.862
I'm gonna have to
exercise my right

06:28.864 --> 06:30.930
to a conversation-free ride.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.767
All right.

06:35.137 --> 06:38.238
Hey, you never know when
you might meet someone...

06:38.240 --> 06:42.375
have a conversation
that could change your life.

06:56.758 --> 06:58.725
Um, excuse me,
why are we stopped?

07:02.764 --> 07:04.230
I just wanna talk to you,
James.

07:04.232 --> 07:05.965
Wha...

07:15.610 --> 07:17.243
You don't wanna do that.

07:26.922 --> 07:28.755
James.

07:28.757 --> 07:30.356
Come on!

07:46.041 --> 07:47.140
Help!

07:47.142 --> 07:48.875
Somebody help me!

07:54.549 --> 07:58.251
Who the hell runs into an alley
when they're being chased?

08:01.890 --> 08:03.156
Really?

08:03.158 --> 08:05.892
What's your plan, bud?

08:07.529 --> 08:09.929
Oh, I don't think you've
run the numbers on that jump.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.199
Please don't kill me!

08:13.201 --> 08:15.168
I have a wife
and two small children.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.402
You do not.

08:16.404 --> 08:18.538
No, uh...

08:18.540 --> 08:20.840
You leave now
and I won't hurt you, okay?

08:20.842 --> 08:22.075
I know parkour.

08:22.077 --> 08:24.544
That's not how parkour works.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.912
Uh...

08:27.249 --> 08:28.848
No, no.

08:30.085 --> 08:32.151
Oh.

08:32.153 --> 08:33.219
Oh!

08:33.221 --> 08:35.388
Ah... ah... Agh.

08:36.925 --> 08:39.158
Ahh!

08:42.697 --> 08:44.330
Ah, shoulda seen that comin'.

08:49.871 --> 08:51.571
Ah.

08:52.507 --> 08:54.073
Ow.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.449
Well hello, Sunshine.

09:05.053 --> 09:06.352
Welcome back.

09:08.356 --> 09:10.256
What's happening?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.925
What...

09:11.927 --> 09:14.127
Why did you take my pants?

09:14.129 --> 09:16.429
Oh, yeah.
You peed yourself.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.498
From the taser,
presumably.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.401
No. No, no, no. Stay there.

09:21.403 --> 09:23.403
I know what this looks like.
I know.

09:23.405 --> 09:25.071
I know
your instinct is to run,

09:25.073 --> 09:26.372
but please, just...

09:26.374 --> 09:27.607
you just gotta listen,
all right?

09:27.609 --> 09:29.309
Let's do this the easy way.

09:30.412 --> 09:32.078
All right.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.413
Ah, fuck it.

09:33.415 --> 09:34.480
Oh.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.950
Ah! Agh!

09:40.088 --> 09:42.055
What the...

09:42.057 --> 09:44.390
Wha... wha... what did you
MacGyver a solenoid?!

09:46.895 --> 09:48.995
Ah! Ah! No! No-no-no...

09:48.997 --> 09:51.264
Tomorrow, Dr. Rowley
is gonna announce

09:51.266 --> 09:54.334
that she is offering a permanent
position for a new project

09:54.336 --> 09:56.135
and she will be
seeking submissions.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.837
How do you know this?

09:57.839 --> 09:59.939
You will be tempted to submit
your time travel theory

09:59.941 --> 10:02.775
which is fuckin' genius
but you will not!

10:02.777 --> 10:05.011
You cannot. If you do,

10:05.013 --> 10:07.747
you will end up
desperately alone,

10:07.749 --> 10:09.615
driven insane!

10:09.617 --> 10:13.152
You will end up losing
everyone that you care about!

10:15.256 --> 10:16.622
That's too big.

10:16.624 --> 10:18.358
That's... that's too much.
Yeah, sorry.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.293
That... no.
Start off slower.

10:20.295 --> 10:21.828
Yes, simple. Simple.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.596
I'm gonna keep it simple.

10:23.598 --> 10:26.366
I'm going to simply introduce
myself to you, that's all.

10:26.368 --> 10:28.167
No, no, no.
I don't wanna hear your name.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.435
No, no, seriously.

10:29.437 --> 10:30.670
You leave right now,

10:30.672 --> 10:32.138
it's like this
never happened, okay?

10:32.140 --> 10:33.639
I... I barely even remember
what you look like.

10:33.641 --> 10:35.008
It's like super cloudy.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.643
James Dolinsky.

10:37.645 --> 10:39.545
Why... why are you saying
my name like that?

10:39.547 --> 10:40.813
It's terrifying.

10:40.815 --> 10:42.982
That's my name too.

10:42.984 --> 10:46.619
I am also James Dolinsky,

10:46.621 --> 10:49.889
because I am you.

10:51.059 --> 10:53.626
From the future.

11:00.735 --> 11:02.502
I'm from the future!

11:02.504 --> 11:04.504
You... you're from
the fu... We...

11:04.506 --> 11:06.005
not you-you, me-you...

11:06.007 --> 11:08.574
We are from the future!

11:15.350 --> 11:16.582
Okay, that's good!

11:16.584 --> 11:18.251
Very, very funny.

11:18.253 --> 11:21.087
Well done. You got me.

11:21.089 --> 11:23.589
Meredith,
you can come out now, okay?

11:23.591 --> 11:24.924
And by the way,

11:24.926 --> 11:26.526
in the history
of shitty sisterly things

11:26.528 --> 11:28.494
that you have done to me,
this one takes the prize!

11:28.496 --> 11:31.030
Look, I know it's a lot
to take in. All right?

11:31.032 --> 11:34.400
It's a lot
to digest, absorb.

11:35.770 --> 11:37.670
Oh my God.

11:37.672 --> 11:39.572
Okay, all right.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.108
Okay. Sure, I'll play.

11:42.110 --> 11:45.278
So you're me, from the future.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.613
So tell me, Me,

11:47.615 --> 11:50.016
how do we execute my brilliant
time travel theories, huh?

11:50.018 --> 11:52.218
You already know.
You're working on it.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.353
Harnessing the power
of the particle collider.

11:54.355 --> 11:57.023
Okay.
Very, very impressive research.

11:57.025 --> 11:58.624
You've been briefed, I see.

11:58.626 --> 12:00.726
Now, has my idiot sister
also told you

12:00.728 --> 12:02.628
that the Large Hadron Collider
in Switzerland

12:02.630 --> 12:05.298
operates at a TeV of 13...

12:05.300 --> 12:06.899
Yeah, and you need 40.
I know.

12:06.901 --> 12:08.568
But what you don't know

12:08.570 --> 12:10.636
is that Rowley
already has one.

12:10.638 --> 12:13.439
She does? Wow, okay.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.942
So tell me, where does she, uh,
where does she keep

12:15.944 --> 12:19.278
this multi-billion dollar
enormous secret machine?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.713
That's the crazy part.
It's tiny!

12:20.715 --> 12:22.782
It's like... it's like this big.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.584
She keeps it in her office
behind a table!

12:24.586 --> 12:26.252
Oh, behind the table.

12:26.254 --> 12:28.621
All right.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.623
Why would he believe that?

12:32.093 --> 12:35.595
That necklace that you're hiding
inside your shirt,

12:35.597 --> 12:40.299
with the ashes
of Mom and Dad in it...

12:40.301 --> 12:42.735
Meredith has one of those too.

12:42.737 --> 12:44.904
And in fact, tomorrow
is the 15th anniversary

12:44.906 --> 12:47.140
of the day
that their plane went...

12:47.142 --> 12:49.575
Okay, you listen to me,
buster.

12:49.577 --> 12:52.145
I don't know who you are,

12:52.147 --> 12:54.847
but you have...
you have precisely 30 seconds

12:54.849 --> 12:56.149
to get your butt
out of my garage...

12:56.151 --> 12:58.050
God fucking damn it!

12:59.320 --> 13:01.354
That's it.

13:01.356 --> 13:02.688
Ah!

13:05.293 --> 13:06.826
What are you doing?

13:06.828 --> 13:07.927
We have the same dick.

13:07.929 --> 13:09.462
Hooks to the left,

13:09.464 --> 13:11.097
three freckles on the tip,
like the Big Dipper.

13:11.099 --> 13:12.431
Oh my God!

13:12.433 --> 13:13.666
Oh, come on.
Now don't be like that.

13:13.668 --> 13:14.834
Just take a look at my dick,

13:14.836 --> 13:16.135
we can clear
this whole thing up.

13:16.137 --> 13:17.637
Please put your penis away,
Sir.

13:17.639 --> 13:19.272
Come on, there is
nothing weird about this!

13:19.274 --> 13:20.506
Okay, all right.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.208
Well, let's take
your dick out

13:22.210 --> 13:23.709
- and we'll see if the Little Dipper...
- I believe you!

13:23.711 --> 13:25.011
I believe you! I believe you!
I'll do what you say!

13:25.013 --> 13:26.546
Okay, I'll quit my job.

13:26.548 --> 13:28.047
All right, well then look
at my fucking cock!

13:28.049 --> 13:29.582
Ahh! Ah! Ah.

13:34.956 --> 13:37.356
How far back can we go?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.625
Oooh-kay.

13:39.627 --> 13:42.695
Okay, Siri, call 9-1-1.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.630
My brother's being molested.

13:44.632 --> 13:48.167
<i>It sounds like talking
with someone might help.</i>

13:48.169 --> 13:50.169
You can find me
where Bryan Gunderland

13:50.171 --> 13:51.737
beat the shit out of you
in seventh grade.

13:51.739 --> 13:53.239
<i>...9-1-1 support...</i>

13:53.241 --> 13:55.741
Oh goddamn it, Siri!
You're so unreliable.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.677
Back away, perve-ass.

13:57.679 --> 13:59.245
Hold your fire, Meredith.
I'm leaving.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.417
Oh! God.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.888
Thank you.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.058
So in which direction was
this man's penis bent exactly?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.093
I am not answering that.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.963
Did this man's penis
in fact resemble yours?

14:18.433 --> 14:20.233
Maybe you could work
with our sketch artist.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.668
Can't you do one
of those line-up things?

14:22.670 --> 14:24.003
What?

14:24.005 --> 14:26.405
I'm not looking at a row
of weird dicks.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.707
Look, the point is,

14:27.709 --> 14:29.075
I'm not even
pressing charges here.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.109
This man...

14:30.111 --> 14:31.944
Hey, you called us.

14:31.946 --> 14:33.246
She called you.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.081
You're an idiot.
What are you gonna do?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.549
You're just gonna
let this guy walk away

14:36.551 --> 14:38.017
after everything
that he did to you?

14:38.019 --> 14:39.785
You've done
so much worse to me

14:39.787 --> 14:41.420
and I sleep in the room next
to you with the door unlocked.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.755
That's not helping
your argument.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.056
Okay, look.

14:44.058 --> 14:45.891
This man sounds
potentially dangerous,

14:45.893 --> 14:48.327
but I cannot force you to do
something you don't wanna do.

14:50.298 --> 14:52.331
If you change your mind,
call me.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.733
Doctor.

15:27.735 --> 15:30.436
- Doctor.
- Come on!

15:30.438 --> 15:32.171
The most amazing thing
happened last night...

15:32.173 --> 15:33.773
Yeah, Rowley just emailed.

15:33.775 --> 15:35.007
She said she wants us all in

15:35.009 --> 15:36.442
for an announcement
in 20 minutes.

15:36.444 --> 15:39.345
An announcement.

15:39.347 --> 15:40.680
This is the part
where you get in my car

15:40.682 --> 15:41.947
and then we drive away?

15:41.949 --> 15:43.182
Yeah, yeah.

15:43.184 --> 15:44.250
- No, no, no.
- No?

15:44.252 --> 15:46.185
Remember? Just let me...

15:50.358 --> 15:53.192
All right.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.365
Looks like
The Great and Powerful Oz

15:59.367 --> 16:01.367
hasn't materialized yet.

16:01.369 --> 16:03.102
You know, for someone
who spends so much time

16:03.104 --> 16:05.204
worshipping
CERN's Hadron Collider,

16:05.206 --> 16:07.139
you do your fair share
of mocking the person

16:07.141 --> 16:09.208
who actually helped
build the thing

16:09.210 --> 16:10.876
and who wrote you a very nice
letter of reference,

16:10.878 --> 16:13.479
I might add.

16:13.481 --> 16:15.281
I'm sorry, I missed that
due to cataclysmic boredom.

16:15.283 --> 16:17.616
Ha ha.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.526
Attention, colleagues.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.563
As you know,
the Rowley Institute

16:30.565 --> 16:33.132
has recently celebrated
its third year.

16:38.239 --> 16:40.439
Where was I?

16:42.076 --> 16:45.344
Attention, colleagues.

16:45.346 --> 16:48.013
As you know,
the Rowley Institute

16:48.015 --> 16:50.249
has recently celebrated
its third year

16:50.251 --> 16:52.051
since opening its doors.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.886
Now you applaud.

16:56.691 --> 16:59.992
Our stock has shown
unprecedented growth

16:59.994 --> 17:03.095
resulting in an influx
in financing.

17:03.097 --> 17:08.167
I have convinced the board to
allow me to use this money to...

17:09.537 --> 17:11.070
..offer a permanent position

17:11.072 --> 17:13.706
to one of you, my valued
employees and colleagues,

17:13.708 --> 17:15.040
where you will lead a team

17:15.042 --> 17:17.109
on a new project
of your choosing.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.378
Project submissions
are due Friday. And remember,

17:19.380 --> 17:21.747
a tiny change today...

17:21.749 --> 17:24.216
...brings a dramatically
different tomorrow.

17:24.218 --> 17:27.086
This is another place
where you applaud.

17:32.293 --> 17:33.559
So here's the facts.

17:33.561 --> 17:36.362
We know
that I invent time travel.

17:36.364 --> 17:38.230
We know that I do it
with Rowley.

17:38.232 --> 17:40.566
Hey! Dr. Rowley,
you're not gonna believe this.

17:40.568 --> 17:41.901
I'm gonna become
a future time tra...

17:41.903 --> 17:43.803
That doesn't work.
She'd fire my ass.

17:43.805 --> 17:45.304
Should tell Courtney.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.239
How can we not tell Courtney?

17:47.241 --> 17:48.774
I feel like not telling
Courtney's a dick move.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.576
Courtney, you're not gonna
believe this.

17:50.578 --> 17:52.044
I become a time traveller.

17:52.046 --> 17:53.879
I figure out time time travel
and I come back

17:53.881 --> 17:55.448
and I take myself hostage

17:55.450 --> 17:57.216
and I pull down my pants
and I show myself my penis.

17:57.218 --> 17:59.585
Ah! Why does every scenario end
with me showing someone my dick?

17:59.587 --> 18:01.253
Oh... wait a minute!

18:01.255 --> 18:02.721
I talk to him.

18:02.723 --> 18:04.123
Pros and cons.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.459
Pros, talk to him,
you get some answers.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.893
How did it work?
How did you figure it out?

18:07.895 --> 18:09.462
How far back can we go?

18:09.464 --> 18:12.498
Cons, mmm, interacting with him
could create a paradox,

18:12.500 --> 18:13.833
could destroy
the entire universe.

18:13.835 --> 18:15.267
That's very bad.
Paradoxes are bad.

18:15.269 --> 18:16.602
Universe is good.

18:16.604 --> 18:18.637
Of course,
I talked to him yesterday.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.906
Talked to him yesterday,
universe still here.

18:20.908 --> 18:22.141
Universe is fine, right?

18:22.143 --> 18:23.642
Universe is good.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.010
Should I go alone
or should I bring someone?

18:25.012 --> 18:26.078
I should bring someone.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.981
Should I bring someone?

18:28.983 --> 18:31.917
No, not gonna bring her.
Okay. Here we go.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.918
In here!

19:12.059 --> 19:13.559
How'd you know
I just got here?

19:13.561 --> 19:15.294
Well, we have
the same memory.

19:15.296 --> 19:19.231
Although things keep changing
so it kinda updates.

19:19.233 --> 19:22.167
I don't know,
it's hard to explain.

19:22.169 --> 19:25.304
You mean like a...
like a download?

19:25.306 --> 19:29.508
Uh, sorta like déjà vu,

19:29.510 --> 19:30.809
only backwards.

19:30.811 --> 19:33.145
And colder.

19:33.147 --> 19:36.181
30 minutes ago you decided
you were gonna come find me

19:36.183 --> 19:39.985
and so my memory changes.

19:39.987 --> 19:42.388
You're taller than me.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.023
Oh, yeah.

19:44.025 --> 19:47.426
Taller, better,
slightly bigger dick.

19:47.428 --> 19:49.194
Time travel
really fucks you up, man.

19:49.196 --> 19:51.830
The past and the present
both pullin' you towards them,

19:51.832 --> 19:54.199
it stretches you out
a little bit each time.

19:54.201 --> 19:56.602
More, depending on
how far back you go.

19:56.604 --> 19:59.405
I mean, this trip
did me in, man.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.873
Look at me!

20:00.875 --> 20:02.608
I think my brain's
stretching too.

20:02.610 --> 20:04.610
Put those on the table,
would ya?

20:04.612 --> 20:05.945
Yeah.

20:13.020 --> 20:14.520
Hey, when did we
learn to bake?

20:14.522 --> 20:16.755
Oh, about the same time

20:16.757 --> 20:20.125
we learn sewing and gardening,

20:20.127 --> 20:23.128
how to build
an off-the-grid sewage system.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.130
See, that...
that's amazing to me.

20:25.132 --> 20:26.899
You want me
to give all that up?

20:26.901 --> 20:28.934
Yeah, well, we are forced
to learn all that

20:28.936 --> 20:31.737
because we have to live
in isolation!

20:31.739 --> 20:34.974
And rely on our
survival skills,

20:34.976 --> 20:36.475
which, by the way,
you don't fucking have.

20:36.477 --> 20:37.943
What else? What else?
Come on, I'm all ears.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.045
Tell me more.

20:40.047 --> 20:42.414
Look,

20:42.416 --> 20:46.118
time travel... it's amazing,

20:46.120 --> 20:48.253
for like ten minutes.

20:48.255 --> 20:50.289
And then it's like you're
being forced to watch reruns

20:50.291 --> 20:53.559
of a show that you hate
and can't turn off.

20:53.561 --> 20:54.927
I have no idea
what that means

20:54.929 --> 20:57.262
but I want you to
tell me everything.

20:57.264 --> 20:59.398
Now tell me... tell me,

20:59.400 --> 21:02.601
how far back can we go,
huh?

21:02.603 --> 21:04.603
Look, our whole life...

21:04.605 --> 21:07.573
our whole life we've had
an all-consuming passion

21:07.575 --> 21:09.608
to be the master of time.

21:09.610 --> 21:13.345
But you don't even appreciate
the time you're in right now!

21:13.347 --> 21:16.315
The beauty that can surround you
at any given moment...

21:16.317 --> 21:19.184
Would ya slow down
on the fucking croissant?

21:22.089 --> 21:24.023
Here.

21:24.025 --> 21:27.092
Little bite.
Let it melt on your tongue.

21:29.463 --> 21:31.263
Hm? Slow.

21:35.369 --> 21:37.236
Slow.

21:43.711 --> 21:45.110
Mmm.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.814
Yeah.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.119
Twelve years from now,

21:54.121 --> 21:58.123
Rowley and I figure out
how to send me back in time.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.359
A one-way trip every time.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.394
I mean,
there's no way forward.

22:02.396 --> 22:05.030
Right, so you have
to stay there,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.665
just waiting
for time to catch up.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.967
Exactly, exactly.
And we're pushing it.

22:08.969 --> 22:10.736
I mean, we start off
with a few minutes,

22:10.738 --> 22:13.238
then a day, a month, a year.

22:13.240 --> 22:17.342
Two years, three years,
five years!

22:17.344 --> 22:19.378
I'm stuck
in a place like this

22:19.380 --> 22:22.414
wasting away,
total isolation!

22:22.416 --> 22:23.882
Meanwhile,
I'm bouncing through time,

22:23.884 --> 22:25.584
Rowley's sitting in her desk,

22:25.586 --> 22:27.319
having the same cup of tea!

22:27.321 --> 22:29.154
Wait a minute, so,

22:29.156 --> 22:30.756
lemme get this straight.

22:30.758 --> 22:32.491
So what you're telling me

22:32.493 --> 22:34.493
is that on top of becoming
the world's first time traveller

22:34.495 --> 22:37.529
I'm also gonna have
these years

22:37.531 --> 22:40.332
of peaceful sabbaticals
with nothing but solitude

22:40.334 --> 22:42.668
where I can practice
my theoretical applications?

22:42.670 --> 22:43.902
Is that what you're saying?

22:43.904 --> 22:46.338
What? No!

22:46.340 --> 22:47.940
You do not want this life!

22:47.942 --> 22:50.075
Yes I do.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.410
I do want this life.

22:51.412 --> 22:54.279
You're too late!

22:54.281 --> 22:58.016
This is science.

22:58.018 --> 22:59.451
It's what I'm meant to do.

22:59.453 --> 23:01.854
You don't have a fucking clue.

23:04.191 --> 23:06.525
There's a reason
I came back now.

23:07.895 --> 23:10.062
I'm still sort of a good guy
when I'm you.

23:10.064 --> 23:13.699
But Friday, man,
that's doomsday.

23:13.701 --> 23:15.100
You take that position,

23:15.102 --> 23:16.368
that is the beginning
of the end.

23:16.370 --> 23:20.239
Your ego,
your self-righteousness,

23:20.241 --> 23:21.473
it's gonna smother

23:21.475 --> 23:23.442
all the other parts
of your life...

23:23.444 --> 23:27.346
love, joy, family.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.649
So I came back to stop you

23:30.651 --> 23:32.918
from making that mistake,

23:32.920 --> 23:34.853
one way or the other.

23:38.893 --> 23:39.992
What if I can do both?

23:39.994 --> 23:42.795
No, what if I...

23:42.797 --> 23:43.829
can change?

23:43.831 --> 23:46.064
Like,
fundamentally change

23:46.066 --> 23:47.733
by Friday,

23:47.735 --> 23:50.469
and then
accept the position?

23:50.471 --> 23:52.671
I'll vanish.

23:54.175 --> 23:57.009
If you truly,
fundamentally change,

23:57.011 --> 24:00.412
then you won't make
a complete mess of my life

24:00.414 --> 24:02.414
and there will be no reason
to come back,

24:02.416 --> 24:05.984
and thus, I won't exist.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.953
Okay.

24:07.955 --> 24:10.455
But if you don't get your shit
together by Friday,

24:10.457 --> 24:12.457
I am gonna fuck up
your life so bad

24:12.459 --> 24:14.693
that you'll never invent
time travel in the first place.

24:14.695 --> 24:16.528
- Oh, that's my...
- Yeah, I know.

24:16.530 --> 24:17.830
I'm gonna need that
for um...

24:17.832 --> 24:19.331
Oh, I know what
you need it for, yeah.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.534
Why don't you come back for it
after I'm gone?

24:22.536 --> 24:24.036
Um...

24:24.038 --> 24:25.304
You... okay.

24:25.306 --> 24:27.439
Just gonna put it in there?

24:27.441 --> 24:29.107
So, uh, quick question.

24:29.109 --> 24:31.043
- If you were me...
- I am you.

24:31.045 --> 24:34.446
So, how would you advise me

24:34.448 --> 24:37.816
to start this
process of change?

24:37.818 --> 24:40.986
Um, maybe have some
quality time with Meredith?

24:40.988 --> 24:44.623
You need to do the thing
that if you don't do it,

24:44.625 --> 24:46.692
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.830
You need to tell Courtney

24:51.832 --> 24:53.465
how you really feel about her.

24:53.467 --> 24:56.034
She's the greatest thing
that ever happens to you

24:56.036 --> 24:58.503
and you just let her
slip through your fingers.

24:58.505 --> 25:00.639
That's not...

25:00.641 --> 25:02.407
Courtney is my friend

25:02.409 --> 25:04.309
and I do not feel
that way about her.

25:04.311 --> 25:05.711
Of course you do,

25:05.713 --> 25:07.246
you just keep it all
locked up inside

25:07.248 --> 25:09.414
and then you jerk off
thinkin' about her,

25:09.416 --> 25:11.216
real quiet so that
Meredith doesn't hear.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.085
I masturbate
at an appropriate volume.

25:13.087 --> 25:14.553
What, you think
I should be louder

25:14.555 --> 25:16.021
so that my sister can hear?

25:16.023 --> 25:18.023
It's eerie quiet, okay?

25:18.025 --> 25:20.225
It's like you're drivin'
a fuckin' Prius.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.594
Okay, let's just say
hypothetically

25:22.596 --> 25:24.897
that I did have certain feelings
for Courtney.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.232
You do.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.768
How do I tell her about... that,

25:29.770 --> 25:33.839
without, you know, jeopardizing
the friendship that we have?

25:33.841 --> 25:36.341
I'll show you!

25:36.343 --> 25:37.776
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

25:37.778 --> 25:40.045
It'd be my pleasure.
I insist.

25:40.047 --> 25:42.447
Yeah, and I...
I insist that you don't.

25:42.449 --> 25:43.715
I got you.

25:43.717 --> 25:45.350
I don't know
what that means...

25:45.352 --> 25:47.486
I gotcha covered.

25:57.131 --> 25:58.563
Why are we here?

25:58.565 --> 26:01.066
I should be home
for my movie date with Courtney.

26:01.068 --> 26:04.303
You're meeting Meredith here
to dump the ashes.

26:04.305 --> 26:06.305
She's gonna be here
any minute.

26:06.307 --> 26:08.874
Right, of course.

26:08.876 --> 26:11.310
Hey! It's important.

26:11.312 --> 26:13.312
Yeah, I know.

26:13.314 --> 26:15.147
I know.

26:15.149 --> 26:16.682
Okay.

26:19.253 --> 26:22.220
So uh, what's your plan
with Courtney?

26:22.222 --> 26:23.822
I'm gonna do what you said.

26:23.824 --> 26:24.923
You know,
what you suggested.

26:24.925 --> 26:26.491
I'm gonna be in the moment.

26:26.493 --> 26:29.094
I feel like you're just
tellin' me what I wanna hear

26:29.096 --> 26:30.329
so I'll leave.

26:31.598 --> 26:34.232
I got this. Okay?
Trust me.

26:34.234 --> 26:36.068
Oh, boy.

27:49.343 --> 27:50.709
I love you!

27:55.749 --> 27:59.151
See? Isn't this better
than working on your proposal?

27:59.153 --> 28:00.552
I commend your choice, Doctor.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.320
Well, thank you.

28:02.322 --> 28:05.490
I am trying to, you know,
live in the moment a bit more,

28:05.492 --> 28:07.225
appreciate life and stuff.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.493
Here you are.

28:08.495 --> 28:10.228
- What is this, wine?
- Yeah.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.664
Meh, I'm not really
in the mood.

28:14.101 --> 28:15.367
Hey, knock knock!

28:15.369 --> 28:17.903
Anybody home?

28:21.842 --> 28:24.009
Doctor.

28:24.011 --> 28:27.412
Uh, I'm sorry...
have we met before?

28:27.414 --> 28:29.581
I'm James.

28:29.583 --> 28:32.384
James...?

28:32.386 --> 28:36.688
Uh... I'm...
I mean, I'm... I'm Jimmy.

28:36.690 --> 28:37.756
I'm... um...

28:37.758 --> 28:40.525
James' Uncle Jimmy.

28:40.527 --> 28:41.593
Uncle Jimmy.

28:41.595 --> 28:42.894
He's actually...

28:42.896 --> 28:46.031
He's named after me.
It's...

28:46.033 --> 28:48.967
Jimmy! Wow,
it's nice to meet you.

28:48.969 --> 28:51.536
Weird that I've never met you
before, or heard of you.

28:51.538 --> 28:53.905
Yeah, well, I've...

28:53.907 --> 28:57.142
I've been kinda estranged
from the family for a while.

28:57.144 --> 28:59.978
My fault. Workaholic.

28:59.980 --> 29:03.181
Priorities way outta whack.

29:04.585 --> 29:06.551
But I am back now.

29:06.553 --> 29:07.786
Yeah, a whole new man.

29:07.788 --> 29:11.223
Yeah, a lot of time
to sort out my shit.

29:11.225 --> 29:12.991
God, Courtney,
it is good to see you.

29:12.993 --> 29:14.593
Oh!

29:14.595 --> 29:18.130
I mean, I... I assume
that you're Courtney?

29:18.132 --> 29:19.898
Yeah.

29:19.900 --> 29:24.903
Yeah, 'cause James
has described you...

29:24.905 --> 29:26.972
I mean, in passing, before.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.273
Oh.

29:28.275 --> 29:29.841
Anyway, I just got to town,

29:29.843 --> 29:31.476
I thought I'd surprise you,
James, and make you dinner,

29:31.478 --> 29:33.778
but I did not realize
that you had company.

29:33.780 --> 29:35.013
So I... I'm gonna go.

29:35.015 --> 29:36.114
Okay.

29:36.116 --> 29:37.149
Oh no, that's okay.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.250
It's just movie night. Stay.

29:38.252 --> 29:39.818
I don't wanna be
the third wheel.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.086
Third wheel to what?

29:41.088 --> 29:42.821
Him picking apart
every plothole?

29:44.424 --> 29:45.957
- He really is annoying, isn't he?
- Yeah.

29:45.959 --> 29:47.592
I mean, we get it,

29:47.594 --> 29:49.761
the Imperial troopers should
have definitely shot down

29:49.763 --> 29:51.596
the escape pod
with R2 and 3PO,

29:51.598 --> 29:53.532
but then there would be
no <i>Star Wars.</i>

29:53.534 --> 29:55.600
They didn't have to show the
trooper noticing the pod escape,

29:55.602 --> 29:57.102
that's all...
that's what I was suggesting.

29:57.104 --> 29:59.337
Oh my god, what a nerdball.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.006
Hey, have you guys eaten, huh?

30:01.008 --> 30:02.274
No!

30:02.276 --> 30:03.942
Well why don't we
scrap the movie,

30:03.944 --> 30:05.210
I'll cook, we'll eat,

30:05.212 --> 30:07.512
we'll drink,
we'll catch up a little bit.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.447
Okay,
that sounds like fun.

30:09.449 --> 30:10.982
- I'll help you.
- Great!

30:10.984 --> 30:12.150
I like cooking.

30:12.152 --> 30:13.552
Very good.
Thank you very much.

30:13.554 --> 30:15.420
Ah, tequila?

30:17.224 --> 30:20.559
Oh my god, she's incredible.

30:20.561 --> 30:22.694
I told you, I have this.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.863
Yeah, well I realized
sending you in here alone

30:24.865 --> 30:27.732
is like asking a five-year-old
to man a space station.

30:27.734 --> 30:29.034
I'm gonna help you,
all right?

30:29.036 --> 30:31.469
I'm gonna be
your Sherpa guide to love.

30:31.471 --> 30:33.038
How is you being here
gonna help me

30:33.040 --> 30:34.306
profess my feelings
for her?

30:34.308 --> 30:36.107
Just follow my lead.

30:41.148 --> 30:42.981
Yeah, we're gonna talk
about that later.

30:42.983 --> 30:44.249
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:44.251 --> 30:45.584
Yeah.

30:45.586 --> 30:46.918
Yeah.

30:49.823 --> 30:51.256
How 'bout a drink, huh?

30:51.258 --> 30:52.557
Let's have some tequila.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.260
Let's make some chow
and open that bottle!

30:55.262 --> 30:56.528
Let's do it!

30:56.530 --> 30:57.762
You got limes!

31:04.705 --> 31:06.037
Try this.

31:06.039 --> 31:08.773
Um, mm,
I don't like guac.

31:08.775 --> 31:10.508
Oh, this is good guac.
I made it.

31:10.510 --> 31:12.877
Yeah, I had a bad experience
as a kid, so I...

31:12.879 --> 31:15.380
What, you're gonna rule out guac
after one bad experience?

31:15.382 --> 31:17.182
Come on,
you're a scientist, damn it.

31:17.184 --> 31:18.550
You cannot
give up on something

31:18.552 --> 31:21.920
until you have ruled out
every possibility.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.355
- Okay.
- All right!

31:23.357 --> 31:25.223
I'll try it.

31:28.362 --> 31:29.594
Mmm!

31:37.804 --> 31:39.237
He's been in the garage,

31:39.239 --> 31:40.472
just like working for hours,

31:40.474 --> 31:42.140
hasn't eaten in days,
right?

31:42.142 --> 31:45.110
He sees the chicken,
he like eats it off my plate.

31:45.112 --> 31:48.747
Two days later, he's like,
"I have a stomach ache.

31:48.749 --> 31:50.548
"I have to take a shit
but I'm constipated."

31:50.550 --> 31:51.816
Anyway, guess what happened.

31:51.818 --> 31:53.218
Chicken bone
came out of his ass.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.320
Oh my god!

31:55.322 --> 31:57.422
Oh, you got a...

31:57.424 --> 31:58.990
little schmutz on your...

31:58.992 --> 32:00.759
Oh! Right here? No...

32:00.761 --> 32:01.993
May I?

32:01.995 --> 32:03.395
Oh! Yeah.

32:11.605 --> 32:13.805
It's like...

32:13.807 --> 32:15.940
it's like
no matter what I'm doing,

32:15.942 --> 32:18.443
I'm always aware that there's
like an infinite number

32:18.445 --> 32:20.812
of other things
that I could be doing.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.848
Exactly, and the trick is you
gotta keep doing all of them.

32:23.850 --> 32:25.483
Grab as much as you can,

32:25.485 --> 32:26.785
without letting it
fuck you up!

32:26.787 --> 32:28.186
You gotta keep your balance.

32:28.188 --> 32:30.689
Yeah, like stay grounded.

32:30.691 --> 32:31.956
Gravity.

32:31.958 --> 32:34.326
Like gravity,
exactly, yeah.

32:34.328 --> 32:37.128
And not waste
my time and my energy

32:37.130 --> 32:39.097
thinking about
all the other things.

32:39.099 --> 32:40.131
Mmm.

32:40.133 --> 32:42.167
Those "what ifs", baby.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.668
They will drive you insane.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.669
Yeah.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.937
So I don't know.

32:45.939 --> 32:47.172
Like, what's...

32:47.174 --> 32:50.175
like, your advice,
if you have any?

32:50.177 --> 32:51.443
Oh, I don't have
a fuckin' clue!

32:51.445 --> 32:52.544
No!

32:52.546 --> 32:54.012
No, I know.

32:55.649 --> 32:57.482
But I guess there's some sort
of Zen Buddhist bullshit

32:57.484 --> 32:58.717
that probably applies,

32:58.719 --> 33:00.185
you know?

33:00.187 --> 33:02.554
Don't dwell on the past.

33:04.358 --> 33:08.360
Don't dream about the future,
just...

33:08.362 --> 33:11.930
wherever you are, be all there.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.500
Be all there.

33:15.502 --> 33:18.036
Yeah. Wow.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.208
Well, yeah. You know what?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.676
I'm gonna take off.

33:24.678 --> 33:26.745
Oh, no.
It's still so early!

33:26.747 --> 33:28.046
That was great.
Thank you for dinner.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.581
I'm sorry
for crashing the party.

33:29.583 --> 33:30.982
Well, you know what?

33:30.984 --> 33:33.718
I had a really great time.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.187
Thank you so much!

33:36.189 --> 33:38.556
I had so much fun.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.759
Really fun.

33:40.761 --> 33:42.060
That was great.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.361
Thank you so much.

33:44.664 --> 33:46.831
What the hell was that?!

33:46.833 --> 33:48.233
What?

33:48.235 --> 33:49.934
Wh...

33:49.936 --> 33:51.236
How did you...

33:51.238 --> 33:53.538
What did...
what did you do to her?

33:53.540 --> 33:57.041
I listened to her.

33:57.043 --> 34:00.011
You spend years livin' in shit
almost all by yourself,

34:00.013 --> 34:01.880
you get really good
at connecting with people

34:01.882 --> 34:03.114
when you get the chance.

34:03.116 --> 34:05.617
Mostly with prostitutes,
but uh...

34:05.619 --> 34:07.519
I can't do this.
I don't know how.

34:07.521 --> 34:10.188
How the hell... I'm supposed
to just magically transform

34:10.190 --> 34:11.890
a friendship
into a romantic thing?

34:11.892 --> 34:13.258
- I don't know.
- Relax, okay?

34:13.260 --> 34:14.859
You can do this.

34:14.861 --> 34:17.796
You know everything you need
to know about this girl.

34:17.798 --> 34:20.265
You even know
what's going to happen.

34:23.804 --> 34:25.637
She gets the job at CERN,

34:25.639 --> 34:29.040
she moves to Switzerland,

34:29.042 --> 34:33.378
and you get so consumed
with your time travel bullshit

34:33.380 --> 34:35.847
with Rowley
that you never see her again.

34:37.551 --> 34:39.584
What? I... that's not...

34:39.586 --> 34:41.453
I mean...
She's my best friend.

34:41.455 --> 34:42.787
I don't go visit her?

34:45.892 --> 34:47.992
All right. Now,
don't fuck this up, okay?

34:47.994 --> 34:49.561
I got my whole evenin' planned

34:49.563 --> 34:51.796
around this potential
new memory.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.498
Yeah.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.433
Good.

34:55.435 --> 34:57.202
Ow.

35:04.344 --> 35:06.911
Hey.
You wanna finish the movie?

35:06.913 --> 35:09.147
- No.
- Okay.

35:09.149 --> 35:10.415
No, I don't wanna
finish the movie.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.750
I wanna...
I wanna listen to you.

35:12.752 --> 35:14.752
Listen to me what?

35:14.754 --> 35:16.421
Well, I mean, you and I,

35:16.423 --> 35:17.956
we spend a lot of time
together, right?

35:17.958 --> 35:20.358
But we never actually talk
about real things.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.360
We never talk.
I want you to tell me...

35:22.362 --> 35:24.596
What are you thinking
right now?

35:24.598 --> 35:28.666
Um, what's the deal
with your uncle?

35:28.668 --> 35:31.369
Is he married?
Is he stickin' around, or?

35:33.273 --> 35:36.541
Oh my god, I'm joking!

35:36.543 --> 35:38.643
What is happening
to you right now?

35:38.645 --> 35:40.512
Why are you being
so weird?

35:42.983 --> 35:45.950
Do you ever think
about Schrِdinger's cat?

35:45.952 --> 35:47.385
The uncertainty principle,

35:47.387 --> 35:49.153
you mean the cornerstone
to quantum physics?

35:49.155 --> 35:50.388
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, yes.

35:50.390 --> 35:52.190
- So you've got this cat, right?
- Yes.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.491
He puts the cat
in the box.

35:53.493 --> 35:55.159
- No, I know.
- With radiation.

35:55.161 --> 35:56.528
- Is the cat alive or is the cat dead, right?
- Yeah.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.229
- It's both...
- James.

35:58.231 --> 35:59.831
- I don't wanna talk about this.
- until you take a look...

35:59.833 --> 36:01.566
No, listen, listen.
That applies to so many things.

36:01.568 --> 36:02.834
It could be anything.

36:02.836 --> 36:04.636
It could be milk
in the refrigerator.

36:04.638 --> 36:06.037
- Yeah.
- On its expiration date.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.372
Or it could be, uh,

36:07.374 --> 36:10.408
a relationship between
two consenting adults.

36:12.178 --> 36:14.746
What are you doing?

36:14.748 --> 36:16.014
What?

36:16.016 --> 36:18.583
Have you ever...

36:18.585 --> 36:21.352
We're together all the time,
but we never...

36:21.354 --> 36:22.587
Why have we never?

36:22.589 --> 36:25.423
We've never tried
to open the box.

36:25.425 --> 36:27.191
Yeah, because we...

36:27.193 --> 36:30.662
I mean, I thought we didn't
see each other that way, so...

36:30.664 --> 36:34.165
Yeah but the uncertainty
principle, right?

36:34.167 --> 36:36.267
Yeah, but, I mean,
I thought...

36:36.269 --> 36:37.835
well, if something
was gonna happen,

36:37.837 --> 36:39.370
it would've happened by now

36:39.372 --> 36:41.506
and it didn't happen by now,
so, I mean, it's not...

36:42.776 --> 36:44.876
What are you doing?

36:46.379 --> 36:51.015
I wanna know if our cat
is alive or dead?

36:51.017 --> 36:52.250
Are you serious right now?

36:52.252 --> 36:53.685
Yeah.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.724
Oh my god.

36:59.726 --> 37:01.125
Oh, boy.

37:01.127 --> 37:03.261
Oh my god! I'm sorry!

37:03.263 --> 37:04.529
No. No, no, no. Listen...

37:04.531 --> 37:06.431
I'm so stupid.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.400
No, I... Listen.
I'm sorry.

37:09.402 --> 37:12.303
Um, you know what?

37:12.305 --> 37:15.373
I... I am. I'm... I'm...

37:16.376 --> 37:18.276
I'm open.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.578
Not like that. I mean I...

37:20.580 --> 37:25.116
I'm down to try
the opening of the box thing.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.618
Although,
I don't like that phrase.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.454
I think it sounds weird,
but, um...

37:30.590 --> 37:32.590
Look, we're not gonna start
by uh,

37:32.592 --> 37:35.326
making out in your kitchen,
are we?

37:35.328 --> 37:39.097
You know, we can...
maybe we can go out?

37:39.099 --> 37:42.166
Like adults on a date

37:42.168 --> 37:45.069
and if it's not super weird,
you know,

37:45.071 --> 37:47.071
we could maybe, uh,
try the fun thing,

37:47.073 --> 37:48.406
you know, the other part.

37:48.408 --> 37:49.807
Yeah, really?
Would you be open to that?

37:49.809 --> 37:51.242
I... yeah. I mean,

37:51.244 --> 37:53.077
you're not the only science nerd
that gets horny.

37:53.079 --> 37:55.446
- Oh.
- You know, um...

37:55.448 --> 37:57.448
You know how long it's been
since I've been on a date?

37:57.450 --> 37:59.651
Like, a long...
a long time,

37:59.653 --> 38:01.419
and it... it's hard.

38:01.421 --> 38:04.756
It's hard to find someone
when you're ten times smarter

38:04.758 --> 38:07.692
than 98.38%
of the male population.

38:07.694 --> 38:11.162
And... so, you're gonna
ask me out properly.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.430
When you said "horny"
earlier...

38:12.432 --> 38:13.665
James, please focus.

38:13.667 --> 38:14.966
Okay! Okay,
I'm gonna ask you out.

38:14.968 --> 38:16.367
Would you... Courtney,
would you like to go

38:16.369 --> 38:17.769
and open the box with me
tomorrow night?

38:17.771 --> 38:19.337
You're gonna have to...

38:19.339 --> 38:20.605
- No, we're gonna have to rephrase that.
- Fine.

38:20.607 --> 38:21.773
'Cause it just
sounds weird to me.

38:21.775 --> 38:23.041
We can totally do away
with that one.

38:23.043 --> 38:25.343
- So, yeah. Great.
- Listen, you're just...

38:25.345 --> 38:27.011
You're gonna have to put
some effort into it.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.312
- Okay.
- You know?

38:28.314 --> 38:29.947
Um, change your shirt,
for example.

38:29.949 --> 38:30.982
Yes! I have many shirts.

38:30.984 --> 38:32.116
And maybe take a shower?

38:32.118 --> 38:33.151
I'm gonna take a bath
or a shower.

38:33.153 --> 38:34.652
Perhaps.

38:34.654 --> 38:37.388
Whichever, and um,
I'll maybe see you tomorrow.

38:37.390 --> 38:39.557
- Yes.
- I will, I will. Excuse me.

38:39.559 --> 38:40.725
And um, yeah. I'm gonna...

38:40.727 --> 38:42.293
All right.

38:42.295 --> 38:43.995
So yeah, don't mess this up.

38:43.997 --> 38:45.296
I won't. I won't.

38:45.298 --> 38:46.831
- Okay.
- All right.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.733
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:54.407 --> 38:55.973
That was not terrible.

38:57.510 --> 38:59.811
Oh, I forgot to mention,
we can also teleport.

39:00.980 --> 39:03.214
I'm kidding.
I snuck in the back.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.717
So you saw that?

39:05.719 --> 39:06.751
I did it, man. I did it.

39:06.753 --> 39:08.986
I... I told her how I felt.

39:08.988 --> 39:11.723
Now I got a date
tomorrow night.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.392
How does the date go?

39:14.394 --> 39:15.526
Does the date go well?

39:15.528 --> 39:16.894
I have no idea.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.730
It hasn't happened yet.

39:18.732 --> 39:22.233
What I do know
is I'm still here,

39:22.235 --> 39:24.235
which means
we got work to do.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.373
I really don't
have time for this.

39:29.375 --> 39:31.576
I... I should be working
on my presentation.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.111
Spoiler alert:
you get the job.

39:33.113 --> 39:35.012
Now come on up here.

39:35.014 --> 39:36.681
It doesn't even look
like you're doing anything.

39:36.683 --> 39:38.216
I'm calming my mind,

39:38.218 --> 39:41.052
focusing on my breath,
letting my thoughts go.

39:41.054 --> 39:42.286
Get your ass up here.

39:42.288 --> 39:44.789
Okay.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.427
Good.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.596
All right.

39:51.598 --> 39:52.964
Now close your eyes.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.702
Put one hand on your chest,

39:57.704 --> 39:59.904
one on your stomach.

39:59.906 --> 40:00.938
Good.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.207
Take a breath, deep breath.

40:04.577 --> 40:06.878
Good. Now let it out, slow.

40:08.414 --> 40:10.548
Think I'm doin' that wrong.

40:10.550 --> 40:13.451
Meditation isn't about doing,
it's about being.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.719
Being present.

40:14.721 --> 40:17.155
Not letting your mind
take over.

40:17.157 --> 40:18.589
Yeah, that's...

40:18.591 --> 40:20.291
that's not easy for me.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.426
I know that, that's why
I'm here to ease you into it.

40:22.428 --> 40:24.495
Just take it in, the breeze.

40:24.497 --> 40:28.132
The sound of the birds,

40:28.134 --> 40:30.434
the scent of the world.

40:35.308 --> 40:36.674
Ah!

40:36.676 --> 40:38.476
Ah! Good, good.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.744
Now right there.
You're present.

40:39.746 --> 40:41.078
Right now!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.446
You're not thinkin'
about the past,

40:42.448 --> 40:43.781
you're not thinking
about the future.

40:43.783 --> 40:45.650
You are right here,
right now. Good!

40:45.652 --> 40:46.984
Now close your eyes.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.319
Good.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.988
Focus on that searing pain
in your cheek.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.657
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.125
Don't fight the pain.
Let it in.

40:54.127 --> 40:55.426
Breathe!

40:55.428 --> 40:58.529
Good.

41:00.433 --> 41:01.465
Breathe!

41:01.467 --> 41:02.500
- Breathe!
- Ow!

41:02.502 --> 41:04.001
Be one with yourself.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.736
- Oh! Why do you...
- Focus.

41:08.975 --> 41:11.442
My god, you want some hotdog
with your ketchup?

41:11.444 --> 41:14.478
Oh, I've missed it
so much.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.947
Wait. We...

41:15.949 --> 41:17.515
We seriously don't have
ketchup in the future?

41:17.517 --> 41:19.283
None.

41:19.285 --> 41:22.186
None. Everybody's worried
about honey, saving the bees.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.988
Let me tell ya,
we way overcompensated

41:23.990 --> 41:26.457
for the bee issue.
Becomes a real problem.

41:26.459 --> 41:28.392
I mean, like, terrifying.

41:28.394 --> 41:30.294
When what we should've
been worried about

41:30.296 --> 41:33.531
was nightshade vegetables.

41:33.533 --> 41:36.367
Not a tomato
on the fuckin' planet.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.903
- Ah, there we go.
- Thank you.

41:39.973 --> 41:41.672
Thank you.

41:41.674 --> 41:43.507
So,
why'd you ditch Meredith yesterday?

41:43.509 --> 41:46.110
I left ya there.
I dropped you off!

41:48.181 --> 41:51.883
I'm tellin' you, you can't
hide shit from me, man.

41:51.885 --> 41:53.351
You think I don't know
that all you wanna do

41:53.353 --> 41:55.052
is go back
and see Mom and Dad?

41:55.054 --> 41:57.922
Huh. Maybe tell them
to not get on the plane.

41:57.924 --> 41:59.190
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

41:59.192 --> 42:01.592
Wait.

42:01.594 --> 42:03.761
So can we go back that far?

42:07.867 --> 42:09.667
No.

42:10.904 --> 42:14.272
No, I couldn't figure it out.

42:14.274 --> 42:17.141
Well, just because you couldn't
doesn't mean that I can't.

42:18.211 --> 42:19.277
I'm you, genius.

42:19.279 --> 42:20.878
Show me your numbers.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.413
You know, I can pick up
where you left off. I...

42:22.415 --> 42:23.714
I ran the numbers.

42:23.716 --> 42:26.284
I nearly lost my mind
in the process.

42:26.286 --> 42:28.686
Look, it took me a long time
to come to terms

42:28.688 --> 42:32.356
with the fact
that we can't save them.

42:35.962 --> 42:37.461
I really think if you let me
run the numbers...

42:37.463 --> 42:39.263
Goddamn it,
listen to me!

42:39.265 --> 42:41.098
You need to take care of this.

42:41.100 --> 42:44.402
You need to be a goddamn
proper fucking brother

42:44.404 --> 42:45.770
to that sister of yours,

42:45.772 --> 42:48.105
because one day
she's gonna leave you.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.074
She's gonna give up on you
altogether

42:50.076 --> 42:51.208
and you're gonna have nobody.

42:51.210 --> 42:53.444
And you're gonna deserve it.

43:01.788 --> 43:03.487
What? It's dirt!

43:03.489 --> 43:06.290
You know what's in these
fucking things? Pigs' assholes!

43:06.292 --> 43:09.961
The dirt is the least
disgusting part of this!

43:17.937 --> 43:19.770
Meredith?

43:25.278 --> 43:29.146
Hey.
I'm sorry about yesterday.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.414
I didn't, uh...

43:30.416 --> 43:32.683
I didn't make it
to the boardwalk.

43:32.685 --> 43:35.319
Really? I didn't notice.

43:37.523 --> 43:39.991
Right. Yes.

43:39.993 --> 43:41.258
Um...

43:41.260 --> 43:44.929
Anyway...

43:44.931 --> 43:46.864
I have a date.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.505
You dress like you're
higher on the spectrum

43:54.507 --> 43:58.976
than you actually are.

43:58.978 --> 44:02.046
Process of elimination... nah!

44:02.982 --> 44:05.950
Yeah? Okay.

44:05.952 --> 44:08.552
Pants?

44:34.213 --> 44:35.679
So, I...

44:35.681 --> 44:38.382
I didn't see you
at the office today.

44:38.384 --> 44:43.220
Yeah. I um...
took a personal day?

44:44.157 --> 44:45.389
Oh.

44:45.391 --> 44:46.824
I meditated.

44:46.826 --> 44:48.559
Yeah, right.

44:48.561 --> 44:49.593
No, I'm serious.

44:49.595 --> 44:52.563
I told you, I'm trying...

44:52.565 --> 44:54.598
I'm trying to be
more present.

44:55.668 --> 44:57.001
Oh.

44:58.905 --> 45:01.605
Has that got anything to do
with Uncle Jimmy?

45:01.607 --> 45:04.108
I mean, I don't know
what happened in the past,

45:04.110 --> 45:06.343
but I think
that he should stay.

45:06.345 --> 45:08.179
I've decided.

45:08.181 --> 45:09.580
He's great!

45:09.582 --> 45:10.614
- Right.
- No?

45:10.616 --> 45:12.083
Are you guys ready to order?

45:12.085 --> 45:13.684
Yeah.

45:13.686 --> 45:14.752
Yeah, I think we are.

45:14.754 --> 45:17.221
Um, let's see.

45:17.223 --> 45:18.522
Do, do, do, do.

45:18.524 --> 45:22.059
So, he's gonna have
the butter chicken.

45:22.061 --> 45:24.462
Yep, he is.

45:24.464 --> 45:27.198
And he's gonna have it
ridiculously spicy.

45:27.200 --> 45:30.801
You know, just spice the hell
out of it. He loves it.

45:30.803 --> 45:33.204
Can do. And for yourself?

45:38.878 --> 45:43.881
Yes. So, she will have the...

45:43.883 --> 45:45.916
Ah. The Marrakesh panini

45:45.918 --> 45:48.719
with extra yoghurt please.

45:48.721 --> 45:50.921
She loves yoghurt.
Lots of yoghurt.

45:50.923 --> 45:53.791
When you think there's
too much yoghurt on there,

45:53.793 --> 45:55.493
add some more yoghurt.

45:55.495 --> 45:57.895
It should be just soggy.

45:57.897 --> 46:00.297
Thanks so much.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.333
Uh, and some more drinks.

46:05.771 --> 46:07.938
I really think
you're gonna love your dinner.

46:07.940 --> 46:09.673
And I think
you will like yours.

46:09.675 --> 46:11.709
No.

46:17.650 --> 46:18.916
So, is this weird?

46:18.918 --> 46:23.020
You and me,
on like a proper date?

46:23.022 --> 46:25.456
Yeah, it's weird. It's...

46:25.458 --> 46:29.193
It's weird, but all dates
are weird, right?

46:33.466 --> 46:34.865
To weird.

46:34.867 --> 46:37.067
To weird.

46:43.643 --> 46:45.809
- Ooh.
- Oh, wow.

46:45.811 --> 46:47.311
Wow. That's...

46:47.313 --> 46:49.213
That's what I wanted.

46:50.783 --> 46:52.783
No problem.

46:54.053 --> 46:56.187
It's good, huh?

46:56.189 --> 46:58.789
Yeah, not bad.

46:58.791 --> 47:00.224
Ooh.

47:00.226 --> 47:02.793
Oh, there it is. There it is.

47:02.795 --> 47:04.028
Want some yoghurt?

47:04.030 --> 47:05.462
- No, I'm good.
- Great.

47:06.732 --> 47:08.065
Okay.

47:10.203 --> 47:11.969
I can't even watch!

47:11.971 --> 47:13.204
I did it.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.572
Oh!

47:14.574 --> 47:16.273
That's classy.

47:19.045 --> 47:20.144
Ugh.

47:20.146 --> 47:21.378
- No.
- I can't do it.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.080
Oh my god.

47:23.082 --> 47:25.916
Oh, that's gonna be hot later,
comin' out.

47:25.918 --> 47:27.885
Hot mud.

47:27.887 --> 47:29.753
- Ugh!
- Later.

47:31.023 --> 47:32.056
Did you not
wanna know that?

47:32.058 --> 47:33.891
- Hey, that's classy.
- Yeah.

47:33.893 --> 47:35.159
This is date talk.

47:35.161 --> 47:38.762
I'm pretty good at dates,
obviously.

47:38.764 --> 47:40.931
I'm... I'm dying right now.

47:40.933 --> 47:43.434
- You got a little, um...
- Mm?

47:43.436 --> 47:44.702
On your...

47:44.704 --> 47:46.937
You have... It's...
No, it's here.

47:46.939 --> 47:48.639
Here. There you go.

47:50.176 --> 47:51.408
You all done here?

47:51.410 --> 47:52.676
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

47:52.678 --> 47:55.412
I will take this to go,
please.

47:55.414 --> 47:56.714
You want the sauces?

47:56.716 --> 47:58.716
Yeah.
Yeah, my mom and dad,

47:58.718 --> 48:01.852
they used to bring
leftover Indian sauces home

48:01.854 --> 48:03.554
when they went for dinner
and then, you know,

48:03.556 --> 48:06.690
the next day they'd make us
curries or something with it.

48:06.692 --> 48:08.125
You know, it was one of my...

48:09.562 --> 48:10.894
...favourite things.

48:21.107 --> 48:22.773
Okay.
About three minutes.

48:42.595 --> 48:44.795
What are you doing?

48:46.332 --> 48:47.931
Nothing.

48:49.735 --> 48:51.735
Yeah, that's the problem.

49:07.987 --> 49:10.621
- Take that off.
- Yeah.

49:10.623 --> 49:12.122
Doctor.

49:12.124 --> 49:13.490
Doctor.

49:22.335 --> 49:24.468
I'm sorry, that was
really presumptuous of me.

49:24.470 --> 49:26.470
No, we can totally do
clothes-on stuff

49:26.472 --> 49:27.838
or we can not do anything.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.040
You're adorable.

49:47.059 --> 49:48.726
What do we do with that?

49:48.728 --> 49:50.561
Use your imagination?

50:00.706 --> 50:01.739
So I go up here?

50:01.741 --> 50:04.007
No, no! Not my face.

50:04.009 --> 50:05.242
On your lips?

50:05.244 --> 50:07.711
- No, not my...
- No?

50:07.713 --> 50:09.079
No.

50:09.081 --> 50:10.147
Neck?

50:10.149 --> 50:11.548
Yeah.

50:14.353 --> 50:15.753
Oh, that feels nice.

50:17.022 --> 50:18.489
That's because when the skin

50:18.491 --> 50:20.324
drastically changes
from one temperature to...

50:20.326 --> 50:22.259
I understand the way
heat transfer works.

50:22.261 --> 50:23.627
Oh, okay.

50:44.850 --> 50:46.150
It's a loop.

50:47.420 --> 50:48.986
What?

50:49.955 --> 50:51.755
It's a loop!

50:51.757 --> 50:53.424
Wait, what?

50:53.426 --> 50:55.092
Uh...

50:58.264 --> 51:00.063
Of course,
of course, of course.

51:00.065 --> 51:01.465
Closed time-like curves

51:01.467 --> 51:03.267
are allowed solutions
in relativity.

51:03.269 --> 51:05.202
In general relativity!

51:05.204 --> 51:07.604
Oh my god.

51:09.275 --> 51:10.707
Oh my god!

51:10.709 --> 51:12.109
Hey, wait. Don't do that.
Don't do that.

51:12.111 --> 51:13.577
I'm just gonna take
one second here, please.

51:13.579 --> 51:15.078
No, no, no.
Take your time.

51:15.080 --> 51:19.249
I can see that that's
really important to you, so...

51:19.251 --> 51:20.651
No, Courtney, wait.

51:20.653 --> 51:21.919
Please, please, Courtney!

51:21.921 --> 51:24.054
Please.

51:24.056 --> 51:25.923
Look, this changes everything

51:25.925 --> 51:29.126
and it wouldn't have happened
if it wasn't for our moment.

51:30.563 --> 51:33.263
Wow, I'm... I'm honoured
to be a footnote

51:33.265 --> 51:35.666
to your seminal discovery.

51:35.668 --> 51:36.967
Make sure you spell
my name correctly

51:36.969 --> 51:39.069
on the acknowledgements.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.326
What are you doing here?

52:36.328 --> 52:38.028
How was your date last night,
shithead?

52:38.030 --> 52:39.496
What? Why are you...

52:39.498 --> 52:41.031
Why are you
even asking me that?

52:41.033 --> 52:42.799
I thought everything I did
was like memory for you.

52:42.801 --> 52:44.568
Well, the alcohol
makes it a little fuzzy

52:44.570 --> 52:46.303
but I'm pretty sure
I'd remember sleeping

52:46.305 --> 52:48.539
with the love of my life
for the first time.

52:48.541 --> 52:50.474
Also, I'm still here,

52:50.476 --> 52:52.743
which means that you didn't
hold up your end of the bargain

52:52.745 --> 52:55.045
which means it's time
for me to fuck up your life.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.346
What?
What are you gonna do?

52:56.348 --> 52:58.148
- Rowley!
- What? No, no, no, no.

52:58.150 --> 52:59.182
You brought this on yourself.

52:59.184 --> 53:00.417
Stop it!

53:00.419 --> 53:01.518
Edna fuckin' Rowley,
where are you?!

53:01.520 --> 53:02.553
Don't do this.

53:02.555 --> 53:04.154
I'll quit. I promise.

53:04.156 --> 53:05.389
No, you won't.

53:07.092 --> 53:09.593
Doctor Edna fuckin' Rowley,

53:09.595 --> 53:11.094
kindly get your ass out here!

53:11.096 --> 53:12.996
Jimmy, what's going on?

53:14.366 --> 53:15.599
I'm Doctor Edna fucking Rowley.

53:15.601 --> 53:17.601
Do I know you?

53:18.837 --> 53:20.504
I am begging you!

53:20.506 --> 53:22.372
Look, I screwed up really badly
with her last night,

53:22.374 --> 53:24.074
but I can fix it!

53:24.076 --> 53:26.076
Okay, but if you...
if you do this

53:26.078 --> 53:27.711
right now in front of her,

53:27.713 --> 53:30.781
it'll ruin any chance I have
with her, so please, please?

53:33.552 --> 53:35.552
Fine.

53:35.554 --> 53:37.254
You got till the end
of the day.

53:43.529 --> 53:44.761
Well,

53:44.763 --> 53:46.430
that was anticlimactic.

53:46.432 --> 53:48.532
A note to all of you:

53:48.534 --> 53:51.535
if you're going to
swear-scream someone's name,

53:51.537 --> 53:54.204
at least have the decency
to say something compelling

53:54.206 --> 53:56.306
when you finally
have their attention.

54:08.087 --> 54:09.720
Hey!

54:09.722 --> 54:12.589
Hey, I uh...

54:12.591 --> 54:14.591
I really need your help.

54:14.593 --> 54:16.960
I don't know who else
to turn to.

54:21.333 --> 54:23.333
Can you meet me at a bar?

54:23.335 --> 54:25.168
I need to tell you stuff, okay?

54:25.170 --> 54:26.503
I need your ideas,
but first I gotta get drunk,

54:26.505 --> 54:27.771
'cause he knows everything...

54:27.773 --> 54:29.339
Stop it!
You had me at drunk.

54:36.315 --> 54:37.581
Sorry.

54:58.837 --> 55:01.304
That's so gross!

55:05.611 --> 55:07.310
Ooh!

55:10.049 --> 55:12.149
I didn't know
you could do that!

55:12.151 --> 55:14.551
That's not healthy.

55:14.553 --> 55:16.019
Not a healthy choice.

55:18.357 --> 55:21.458
Oh! Oh, wait. Okay.

55:21.460 --> 55:22.559
- I got it!
- Okay.

55:22.561 --> 55:24.394
I got it! Okay, okay.

55:24.396 --> 55:26.296
Let's just assume
for a moment,

55:26.298 --> 55:27.731
for the sake of fun,

55:27.733 --> 55:30.567
that we live in your fantasy
nerd-fest reality,

55:30.569 --> 55:32.669
- and this creep actually is you.
- He is.

55:32.671 --> 55:34.671
Okay, so he wants you
to change your life

55:34.673 --> 55:37.307
- so that you don't become him, right?
- Yeah, yes!

55:37.309 --> 55:40.310
And I can change all the changes
that he wants me to change.

55:40.312 --> 55:41.545
I just don't wanna
do it his way,

55:41.547 --> 55:42.579
I wanna do it my way.

55:42.581 --> 55:43.747
So he's in your way!

55:43.749 --> 55:45.182
Sincerely.

55:45.184 --> 55:46.516
- So you know what we need to do.
- No?

55:46.518 --> 55:48.819
We need to get him
out of your way!

55:48.821 --> 55:49.853
Yeah!

55:49.855 --> 55:50.921
Yeah!

55:50.923 --> 55:52.389
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

56:00.933 --> 56:02.332
Are you guys sure
this is the place?

56:02.334 --> 56:03.734
Yes, yes.
I'm a scientist.

56:03.736 --> 56:05.902
He is so smart.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.204
Show her
your science license.

56:07.206 --> 56:08.739
I told you
a million times,

56:08.741 --> 56:10.006
there's no science license.
It's not a thing.

56:10.008 --> 56:11.608
Watch this.
Why is the sky blue?

56:11.610 --> 56:13.443
The light from the sun

56:13.445 --> 56:15.712
is a particular range in the
electro-magnetic spectrum...

56:15.714 --> 56:16.747
There's the fucker!

56:16.749 --> 56:18.515
What? What?!

56:20.919 --> 56:23.086
You are such a shithead,
James.

56:23.088 --> 56:24.788
Wait, sir, I would like
to remind you at this time...

56:24.790 --> 56:26.957
This is it. We're finished.

56:26.959 --> 56:28.859
Kiss life as you know it
bye-bye.

56:28.861 --> 56:29.926
Excuse me, sir.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.294
Are you threatening this man?

56:31.296 --> 56:32.462
Oh, no.

56:32.464 --> 56:35.031
I'm makin' a promise.

56:35.033 --> 56:36.533
He doesn't mean that.

56:36.535 --> 56:37.801
I... I don't want that
held against him

56:37.803 --> 56:39.136
in a court of law or anything.

56:47.212 --> 56:48.812
She's so mean.

56:48.814 --> 56:50.514
Do you think she's single?

57:02.828 --> 57:04.161
Don't touch anything.

57:04.163 --> 57:06.296
Your tetanus shot
isn't up to date.

57:08.734 --> 57:11.468
This place smells
like cardamom and sadness.

57:17.910 --> 57:19.142
Jojo!

57:19.144 --> 57:21.144
Have you seen
this creepy baby?

57:37.796 --> 57:39.362
Boo!

57:48.807 --> 57:51.274
Okay, Uber's almost here.

57:51.276 --> 57:53.510
Let's keep this party going.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.679
What you wanna do?
You wanna go back to the bar?

57:55.681 --> 57:57.013
You wanna go get froyo?

57:57.015 --> 57:58.048
Wanna go back to the bar?

57:58.050 --> 57:59.716
I gotta go to the office.

57:59.718 --> 58:01.218
Do you get it?
I lost everything.

58:01.220 --> 58:02.385
I gotta...
I gotta catch up.

58:02.387 --> 58:04.487
No, the workday's over,
man.

58:04.489 --> 58:05.722
Plus you are still drunk.

58:07.459 --> 58:08.825
You can catch up tomorrow.

58:08.827 --> 58:10.360
Tonight we're gonna have fun,
you and me.

58:10.362 --> 58:11.895
Meredith, please.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.534
I'm out.

58:17.536 --> 58:19.069
Hey, wait. Wait!

58:19.071 --> 58:21.738
Don't be ridiculous.
I'll drop you off at home.

58:21.740 --> 58:23.807
At home? That's just it.
I don't want to go home!

58:25.244 --> 58:27.143
I hate it there.
Do you know that?

58:27.145 --> 58:28.478
All I ever do

58:28.480 --> 58:31.848
is make sure
that you don't starve.

58:31.850 --> 58:34.751
And I put up with all
of your stupid, obsessive...

58:35.721 --> 58:37.153
Forget it.

58:37.155 --> 58:38.822
Wait. Wait a second.
Would you wait a second?

58:38.824 --> 58:41.958
You need me,
I help you, you bail.

58:42.895 --> 58:44.461
Fuck you.

58:58.911 --> 59:00.610
I need a coffee.

59:00.612 --> 59:02.345
I need a coffee.

59:22.534 --> 59:24.434
Anyone here?

59:29.274 --> 59:30.874
Dr. Rowley?

59:32.477 --> 59:34.277
Dr. Rowley?

1:00:47.019 --> 1:00:48.351
Courtney.

1:00:52.190 --> 1:00:53.223
James?

1:00:53.225 --> 1:00:55.692
James, where are you?

1:00:55.694 --> 1:00:57.127
Up here!

1:00:57.129 --> 1:01:00.830
So...

1:01:00.832 --> 1:01:03.166
um, I just...

1:01:03.168 --> 1:01:06.803
I wanted to clear the air
after what happened.

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:10.306
Wait, what the hell is this?

1:01:10.308 --> 1:01:12.709
If Rowley catches you up here
she's going to...

1:01:14.379 --> 1:01:15.979
What is this?

1:01:15.981 --> 1:01:19.716
I knew she was working
on a particle accelerator.

1:01:21.553 --> 1:01:24.921
How did she...

1:01:24.923 --> 1:01:26.389
Oh!

1:01:27.993 --> 1:01:29.225
It's not a ring.

1:01:29.227 --> 1:01:32.595
No! It's a linear collider.

1:01:34.232 --> 1:01:35.732
Do you think that
she made one? I mean...

1:01:35.734 --> 1:01:37.333
Yes, I think
that she made one

1:01:37.335 --> 1:01:38.935
and I think that it's
somewhere in this building

1:01:38.937 --> 1:01:41.004
and you and I
are gonna find it.

1:01:50.615 --> 1:01:54.617
Now, that's... that's not
why I came up here.

1:01:55.854 --> 1:01:58.688
We have to clean this up.

1:01:58.690 --> 1:02:01.391
We have to put everything
back the way it was.

1:02:01.393 --> 1:02:02.859
No!

1:02:02.861 --> 1:02:05.228
No, no, no,
don't you get it?

1:02:05.230 --> 1:02:06.796
You don't ever have to go
to Switzerland!

1:02:06.798 --> 1:02:09.365
We have a Hadron collider
right here.

1:02:09.367 --> 1:02:11.134
You can stay!

1:02:14.039 --> 1:02:15.071
Where...

1:02:15.073 --> 1:02:17.307
Courtney...

1:02:18.243 --> 1:02:19.309
Courtney.

1:02:19.311 --> 1:02:20.743
Hey.

1:02:20.745 --> 1:02:22.112
What makes you think

1:02:22.114 --> 1:02:24.414
I wanna stay here
with you anyway, James?

1:02:24.416 --> 1:02:26.649
Okay, I know. I messed up,

1:02:26.651 --> 1:02:27.717
but I'm ready to change.

1:02:27.719 --> 1:02:29.385
Really?

1:02:29.387 --> 1:02:31.721
You keep saying that, but you
just act weirder and weirder.

1:02:31.723 --> 1:02:34.724
Like, what happened in
the office today with Jimmy?

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:38.328
You don't know the first thing
about that nutcase, okay?

1:02:38.330 --> 1:02:40.763
He seemed like he needed help.

1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:43.266
What?

1:02:43.268 --> 1:02:44.601
Why can't we just stop
what we're doing tonight

1:02:44.603 --> 1:02:45.835
and go help him?

1:02:45.837 --> 1:02:47.437
I think that'd be
pretty difficult

1:02:47.439 --> 1:02:48.671
'cause visiting hours
are probably over by now.

1:02:48.673 --> 1:02:51.174
- Why, is he in the hospital?
- Nope.

1:02:51.176 --> 1:02:52.275
The zoo?

1:02:52.277 --> 1:02:54.177
- The zoo?!
- I don't know!

1:02:54.179 --> 1:02:55.578
He's in jail!

1:02:55.580 --> 1:02:57.580
Jail? Jesus!

1:02:57.582 --> 1:02:59.082
James, what happened?

1:03:00.752 --> 1:03:02.685
There is stuff that you
don't know about him, okay?

1:03:02.687 --> 1:03:04.954
He threatened me, and he
threatened my well-being

1:03:04.956 --> 1:03:07.257
and he threatened
my future at this institute

1:03:07.259 --> 1:03:08.491
and I will not have it!

1:03:08.493 --> 1:03:10.760
Okay, James, come on.

1:03:10.762 --> 1:03:11.995
He's family. All right?

1:03:11.997 --> 1:03:13.296
You have to bail him out.

1:03:13.298 --> 1:03:15.698
Why, so you can fuck him?

1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:17.600
Oh, man. Wow.

1:03:17.602 --> 1:03:19.135
I'm sorry, I didn't...

1:03:19.137 --> 1:03:21.037
Look, I know
I screwed up last night,

1:03:21.039 --> 1:03:23.773
but I had a moment of clarity
and I'm not gonna apologize

1:03:23.775 --> 1:03:25.308
for wanting to be
a great scientist

1:03:25.310 --> 1:03:28.444
just because you're not
fully committed to it.

1:03:28.446 --> 1:03:30.513
I'm not fully committed?

1:03:30.515 --> 1:03:32.182
Why?

1:03:32.184 --> 1:03:34.851
Why, because I actually have a
life outside of this building?

1:03:36.021 --> 1:03:37.287
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

1:03:37.289 --> 1:03:38.788
Maybe I am into Jimmy.

1:03:38.790 --> 1:03:41.357
Maybe I'm attracted
to someone

1:03:41.359 --> 1:03:43.226
who knows how to relax
and have fun

1:03:43.228 --> 1:03:45.728
and isn't focused
on singlet trails

1:03:45.730 --> 1:03:48.898
when he's kissing my tits!

1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:50.667
You can't make me choose
between science...

1:03:50.669 --> 1:03:55.405
No, no, no. No one's asking you
to choose between anything!

1:03:55.407 --> 1:03:57.640
It's about fully committing
to where you are in the moment.

1:03:57.642 --> 1:04:00.043
Right. "Wherever you are,
be all there."

1:04:00.045 --> 1:04:03.613
Yes! And you don't know
how to do that, James.

1:04:04.983 --> 1:04:07.417
Cat's dead.

1:04:10.989 --> 1:04:12.488
I can't help who I am.

1:04:12.490 --> 1:04:13.990
Well, you know, I...

1:04:13.992 --> 1:04:15.592
I really hope that you get
everything you want,

1:04:15.594 --> 1:04:17.360
because in the meantime,

1:04:17.362 --> 1:04:19.696
I'm gonna be fully committed
to what I want, in Switzerland.

1:04:19.698 --> 1:04:21.264
That's right.

1:04:21.266 --> 1:04:24.100
Dr. Keller called from CERN.

1:04:24.102 --> 1:04:25.368
I got it.

1:04:25.370 --> 1:04:27.437
I'm the first Canadian
to be hired

1:04:27.439 --> 1:04:30.940
in a permanent position
in the theory division.

1:04:30.942 --> 1:04:33.509
How's that for not being
fully committed?

1:04:33.511 --> 1:04:34.844
- Wait...
- No, no, no.

1:04:34.846 --> 1:04:36.679
This isn't the part
where you follow me

1:04:36.681 --> 1:04:38.047
in some grand
romantic gesture, okay?

1:04:38.049 --> 1:04:39.515
So what part is this?

1:04:39.517 --> 1:04:41.784
It's the part where
you leave me the fuck alone.

1:05:16.554 --> 1:05:17.987
Behind the table.

1:05:27.766 --> 1:05:29.465
Ha!

1:06:06.037 --> 1:06:08.237
You have until tonight
to prove it.

1:06:09.174 --> 1:06:11.107
How?

1:06:11.109 --> 1:06:13.609
I mean, we don't invent
time travel for another...

1:06:13.611 --> 1:06:15.144
Your future self.

1:06:15.146 --> 1:06:17.180
Bring him to me.

1:06:18.850 --> 1:06:21.451
You've already seen him.

1:06:21.453 --> 1:06:22.952
He was the one
that stormed in here

1:06:22.954 --> 1:06:24.654
swear-screaming your name
yesterday.

1:06:24.656 --> 1:06:27.824
I'll need a closer look.

1:06:27.826 --> 1:06:28.858
Yeah, that's...

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:30.393
That's gonna be a challenge.

1:06:30.395 --> 1:06:33.062
Um, he knows everything.

1:06:33.064 --> 1:06:35.465
He even knows that we're having
this conversation right now.

1:06:35.467 --> 1:06:37.900
He would know that
I'd be coming after him.

1:06:37.902 --> 1:06:40.203
Fascinating.

1:06:40.205 --> 1:06:42.472
Not my problem.

1:06:44.642 --> 1:06:48.711
But...

1:06:50.148 --> 1:06:54.016
If what you're saying
is true...

1:06:54.018 --> 1:06:58.921
if your theories are correct...

1:06:58.923 --> 1:07:01.290
I'll make you my partner.

1:07:05.663 --> 1:07:06.996
No!

1:07:06.998 --> 1:07:09.565
Sorry.

1:07:09.567 --> 1:07:10.900
Very good.

1:07:13.104 --> 1:07:15.471
Jimmy! Hello?

1:07:16.875 --> 1:07:18.474
I know you can hear me.

1:07:19.744 --> 1:07:23.413
You weren't
at the police station.

1:07:23.415 --> 1:07:25.948
I assume Courtney
bailed you out?

1:07:29.354 --> 1:07:30.720
Partner, huh?

1:07:30.722 --> 1:07:34.357
Boy, you're really
movin' up in the world.

1:07:34.359 --> 1:07:36.225
We can make this right.

1:07:36.227 --> 1:07:37.560
It's almost over.

1:07:37.562 --> 1:07:40.363
Courtney's on her way
to Switzerland,

1:07:40.365 --> 1:07:42.131
Meredith finally
knows the truth.

1:07:42.133 --> 1:07:43.466
Yeah, but...

1:07:43.468 --> 1:07:45.268
you know it's not working,
don't you?

1:07:45.270 --> 1:07:47.537
Your little plan to stop me?

1:07:47.539 --> 1:07:49.405
I mean, you haven't
destroyed my career

1:07:49.407 --> 1:07:51.808
and you're not gonna stop me
from inventing time travel.

1:07:51.810 --> 1:07:53.242
Yeah?
How do you know that?

1:07:53.244 --> 1:07:55.645
Because you're still here.

1:07:56.714 --> 1:07:59.115
You're right.

1:07:59.117 --> 1:08:01.384
That's why we're movin' on
to plan B.

1:08:03.922 --> 1:08:06.055
Plan B?

1:08:06.057 --> 1:08:07.890
Okay! Great. Plan B.

1:08:07.892 --> 1:08:09.258
I didn't know
there was a plan B.

1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:11.227
That's...
What is plan B?

1:08:13.331 --> 1:08:15.798
Kill Rowley.

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:18.167
Plan B is terrible.
That's a very bad plan.

1:08:18.169 --> 1:08:20.136
Very bad plan, you can't...

1:08:20.138 --> 1:08:22.405
You can't do that. You...

1:08:22.407 --> 1:08:25.174
You wouldn't do that. We...

1:08:25.176 --> 1:08:26.476
We don't have that in us.

1:08:26.478 --> 1:08:28.711
Oh, I think we do.

1:08:30.448 --> 1:08:32.081
Wait.

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:34.517
If you kill Rowley, sure,
we don't create time travel,

1:08:34.519 --> 1:08:36.319
but then you can't come back
in time in the first place

1:08:36.321 --> 1:08:37.787
to kill her anyway.

1:08:37.789 --> 1:08:39.088
You would create a paradox

1:08:39.090 --> 1:08:40.857
that would destroy
the entire universe!

1:08:40.859 --> 1:08:43.259
Well that's
an interesting theory.

1:08:43.261 --> 1:08:44.727
Let's find out.

1:08:49.467 --> 1:08:51.167
Fine.

1:08:52.871 --> 1:08:54.604
I give up.

1:08:55.974 --> 1:08:57.507
You win.

1:09:00.278 --> 1:09:02.545
I can't believe
this is what we've become.

1:09:06.885 --> 1:09:08.551
I'm not the bad guy here.

1:09:08.553 --> 1:09:10.419
James.

1:09:12.991 --> 1:09:15.358
Hey, I'm the one
trying to save you!

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:17.460
Hello?

1:09:21.199 --> 1:09:22.732
Seventh grade dance.

1:09:22.734 --> 1:09:24.233
This is where Bryan Gunderland
kicked our ass.

1:09:26.504 --> 1:09:28.571
- Yes, he did.
- Mm-hm.

1:09:30.074 --> 1:09:31.607
Right over there.

1:09:33.711 --> 1:09:36.812
I believe he farted in our face,
if memory serves.

1:09:36.814 --> 1:09:38.047
He certainly did.

1:09:38.049 --> 1:09:39.382
Well, don't worry.

1:09:40.752 --> 1:09:43.052
I got him back.

1:09:43.054 --> 1:09:45.321
Yeah, what?
Did you slash his tires?

1:09:45.323 --> 1:09:46.889
I fucked his wife.

1:09:46.891 --> 1:09:48.524
What?

1:09:48.526 --> 1:09:50.326
- I did!
- You did not.

1:09:50.328 --> 1:09:52.428
(UNCLEAR), I'm tellin' ya,
I found her.

1:09:53.498 --> 1:09:56.165
Horrible! Horrible!

1:09:56.167 --> 1:09:59.435
I have created memories
that I don't even wanna have.

1:10:03.908 --> 1:10:05.174
How'd you do that?

1:10:05.176 --> 1:10:06.609
Guess I was in the moment.

1:10:06.611 --> 1:10:08.044
No...

1:10:13.451 --> 1:10:15.384
Jimmy?

1:10:18.389 --> 1:10:19.689
Huh?

1:10:19.691 --> 1:10:22.091
Welcome back.

1:10:22.093 --> 1:10:23.426
Dr. Rowley will be here
any moment.

1:10:23.428 --> 1:10:25.261
I trust that you
will be respectful.

1:10:25.263 --> 1:10:29.532
Oh my god!

1:10:29.534 --> 1:10:32.435
Funny, is it?

1:10:32.437 --> 1:10:33.936
Oh, yeah.

1:10:33.938 --> 1:10:38.240
It's kinda hilarious
how badly I fucked this up.

1:10:38.242 --> 1:10:41.310
And all because
I underestimated

1:10:41.312 --> 1:10:43.813
how much of a shithead
I used to be.

1:10:43.815 --> 1:10:45.748
I think there's a way
we can all win here.

1:10:45.750 --> 1:10:47.249
I really do.

1:10:47.251 --> 1:10:48.818
Oh, no.
The only way I win

1:10:48.820 --> 1:10:51.787
is if that puckered asshole
of a scientist is dead.

1:10:51.789 --> 1:10:53.990
Hey, she's a brilliant mind
and I will not...

1:10:53.992 --> 1:10:55.324
You know what?
Save your ass kissing

1:10:55.326 --> 1:10:56.726
till she gets here
in about five seconds.

1:10:56.728 --> 1:10:57.760
You're gonna need it.

1:10:57.762 --> 1:10:59.629
James?

1:10:59.631 --> 1:11:01.764
Showtime!

1:11:01.766 --> 1:11:03.332
Hello, Edna!

1:11:03.334 --> 1:11:04.433
Hello, my dear!

1:11:04.435 --> 1:11:06.335
So good to see you!

1:11:06.337 --> 1:11:07.670
You're looking quite youthful.

1:11:07.672 --> 1:11:08.938
Come in!

1:11:08.940 --> 1:11:11.507
Welcome to my humble abode.

1:11:11.509 --> 1:11:12.842
I would offer you

1:11:12.844 --> 1:11:14.143
a cup of tea,

1:11:14.145 --> 1:11:16.178
but I'm a little tied up
at the moment.

1:11:16.180 --> 1:11:18.247
It's incredible.

1:11:18.249 --> 1:11:20.616
I know. I know! And this is
the work that you and I...

1:11:20.618 --> 1:11:24.020
It's incredible that you think
I'm foolish enough

1:11:24.022 --> 1:11:26.856
to believe that this blubbery,

1:11:26.858 --> 1:11:30.593
bulbous,
pasty-skinned, asexual,

1:11:30.595 --> 1:11:34.296
repugnant degenerate
is actually you.

1:11:34.298 --> 1:11:35.364
Uh...

1:11:35.366 --> 1:11:36.999
Dr. Rowley, please wait.

1:11:37.001 --> 1:11:38.834
James, unless you can produce
empirical evidence

1:11:38.836 --> 1:11:40.102
in the next ten seconds...

1:11:40.104 --> 1:11:41.771
- I can. I ask...
- A tissue sample?

1:11:41.773 --> 1:11:43.506
- Well, no.
- Blood? DNA?

1:11:43.508 --> 1:11:45.741
Uh, not exactly.

1:11:48.212 --> 1:11:49.712
James, what are you...

1:11:49.714 --> 1:11:52.014
We have the same,
very specific penis.

1:11:52.016 --> 1:11:54.517
It's like the Big Dipper
with, um...

1:11:55.953 --> 1:11:57.553
Hey, keep your dick
in your pants there, James.

1:11:57.555 --> 1:12:00.022
Edna?

1:12:00.024 --> 1:12:02.491
I am so sorry
for my behaviour yesterday.

1:12:02.493 --> 1:12:05.795
It was uncouth
to say the least.

1:12:05.797 --> 1:12:09.298
How are the treatments going
for the lymphoma?

1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:11.300
Oh, right!

1:12:11.302 --> 1:12:13.335
Yeah, you just found out
about that last week,

1:12:13.337 --> 1:12:15.471
you haven't told anybody.
Sorry!

1:12:15.473 --> 1:12:16.706
Hey, spoiler alert though:

1:12:16.708 --> 1:12:18.307
you kick the crap
out of the cancer.

1:12:18.309 --> 1:12:20.009
Full recovery.

1:12:20.011 --> 1:12:21.243
Edna.

1:12:21.245 --> 1:12:23.879
It's me.

1:12:25.216 --> 1:12:27.249
You don't know me like this,
but I know you.

1:12:28.820 --> 1:12:30.886
I know that your first boyfriend
left you for your sister

1:12:30.888 --> 1:12:32.521
and you haven't spoken
to her since,

1:12:32.523 --> 1:12:37.159
and that your father is
a cold-blooded son of a bitch.

1:12:38.830 --> 1:12:40.529
And that's why you never felt
that you had a family,

1:12:40.531 --> 1:12:42.765
or ever really needed one.

1:12:42.767 --> 1:12:44.166
Stop!

1:12:46.104 --> 1:12:47.603
I've never told anyone
any of this.

1:12:47.605 --> 1:12:48.871
No, you haven't

1:12:48.873 --> 1:12:50.372
and you won't
for about nine years.

1:12:50.374 --> 1:12:51.407
Shall I go on?

1:12:51.409 --> 1:12:52.908
No!

1:12:54.011 --> 1:12:55.811
No.

1:12:57.582 --> 1:12:59.415
That's quite enough.

1:13:04.188 --> 1:13:05.588
My instincts
were right about you.

1:13:05.590 --> 1:13:06.622
Yes, they were.

1:13:06.624 --> 1:13:09.458
Oh, this is so good, Edna.

1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:12.361
I'm gonna save you
12 years of frustration

1:13:12.363 --> 1:13:14.430
and missteps!

1:13:15.399 --> 1:13:16.632
Untie me.

1:13:16.634 --> 1:13:18.033
Dr. Rowley,
I think you've heard

1:13:18.035 --> 1:13:20.536
quite enough for one day.

1:13:20.538 --> 1:13:23.105
We don't have to wait
12 years, James.

1:13:23.107 --> 1:13:25.141
Your future self
can tell us everything

1:13:25.143 --> 1:13:26.909
we need to know today.

1:13:26.911 --> 1:13:27.943
- Yes!
- Dr. Rowley,

1:13:27.945 --> 1:13:30.546
this technology,

1:13:30.548 --> 1:13:32.114
we are going to learn
everything

1:13:32.116 --> 1:13:34.917
that we need to learn
and discover ourselves

1:13:34.919 --> 1:13:37.153
when we're supposed to.
I strongly believe

1:13:37.155 --> 1:13:39.121
that we need to let this
run its course here.

1:13:39.123 --> 1:13:40.923
You need to think bigger,
James.

1:13:40.925 --> 1:13:42.658
Exactly, exactly.

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:44.093
You untie me,

1:13:44.095 --> 1:13:46.662
I'm gonna unlock all the secrets
of the universe.

1:13:46.664 --> 1:13:48.798
Okay. Shh.

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:50.099
What is going on?

1:13:50.101 --> 1:13:52.334
Why did you do that
to yourself?

1:13:52.336 --> 1:13:56.505
Time travel apparently
makes you mildly unstable.

1:13:56.507 --> 1:13:58.240
Another thing
we'll need to work out

1:13:58.242 --> 1:14:00.409
and another reason
why we don't wanna rush

1:14:00.411 --> 1:14:02.745
this process, Dr. Rowley.

1:14:02.747 --> 1:14:06.248
All you need to worry about
and all you need to know

1:14:06.250 --> 1:14:08.617
is that everything's
gonna work out fine here.

1:14:08.619 --> 1:14:10.920
How do you know?

1:14:10.922 --> 1:14:14.323
Well, the fact that he
is still here assures us

1:14:14.325 --> 1:14:16.959
that it all works out.

1:14:16.961 --> 1:14:19.228
Dr. Rowley,
we can do this.

1:14:20.364 --> 1:14:22.364
Your engineering breakthrough

1:14:22.366 --> 1:14:23.833
with my theoretical work?

1:14:23.835 --> 1:14:26.602
I mean, the proof is sitting
right in front of us.

1:14:28.105 --> 1:14:30.773
Well, tomorrow should be
an interesting day.

1:14:30.775 --> 1:14:32.641
Tomorrow?

1:14:32.643 --> 1:14:36.312
I'll announce your promotion
and our partnership.

1:14:36.314 --> 1:14:38.547
Now, what...
what do we do

1:14:38.549 --> 1:14:39.949
about him?

1:14:39.951 --> 1:14:43.219
I mean,
how unstable is he?

1:14:43.221 --> 1:14:44.486
Oh, he's fine, he's fine.

1:14:44.488 --> 1:14:46.155
But you really should go.
Yeah.

1:14:46.157 --> 1:14:47.690
I... I-You know what?

1:14:47.692 --> 1:14:51.126
You should treat yourself
to a hotel room tonight.

1:14:51.128 --> 1:14:52.528
Yeah, don't go home.

1:14:52.530 --> 1:14:55.865
Go to a hotel,
unwind, you know, rest.

1:14:55.867 --> 1:14:57.333
You got a big day tomorrow.

1:14:57.335 --> 1:14:58.868
Get off the grid!

1:14:58.870 --> 1:15:00.703
Don't tell anyone
where you're staying, okay,

1:15:00.705 --> 1:15:02.238
especially not me,

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:04.073
and I will see you
in the morning.

1:15:04.075 --> 1:15:05.341
Indeed, you shall.

1:15:17.521 --> 1:15:19.255
Okay.

1:15:19.257 --> 1:15:20.656
I'm gonna untie you,

1:15:20.658 --> 1:15:21.991
and I'm gonna take that
out of your mouth,

1:15:21.993 --> 1:15:23.759
but you need to listen
to me first, okay?

1:15:23.761 --> 1:15:26.996
This is my life.

1:15:26.998 --> 1:15:29.665
You had your chance
and I am truly sorry

1:15:29.667 --> 1:15:32.167
that it didn't work out
the way that you wanted it to.

1:15:33.938 --> 1:15:37.072
But this is what I want.

1:15:37.074 --> 1:15:39.742
Maybe you'll never disappear
and that's fine.

1:15:39.744 --> 1:15:43.178
You can go and live your life

1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:45.848
the way you want to,
now, in the present!

1:15:47.451 --> 1:15:50.486
And let me
live the way I want.

1:15:53.357 --> 1:15:55.024
Nod if you understand this.

1:15:59.130 --> 1:16:01.030
Right. So you...

1:16:01.032 --> 1:16:02.598
Okay. I'm gonna...

1:16:07.371 --> 1:16:09.038
Gonna get you out of here.
There you go.

1:16:10.107 --> 1:16:12.207
Right, right.

1:16:16.314 --> 1:16:18.714
You're not gonna
say anything?

1:16:18.716 --> 1:16:20.649
Nothin' to say.

1:16:20.651 --> 1:16:22.484
You're on your own.

1:16:35.599 --> 1:16:37.566
Hey!

1:16:37.568 --> 1:16:39.902
Hey.

1:16:39.904 --> 1:16:42.771
Uh...

1:16:42.773 --> 1:16:45.074
There's somethin'
I need to tell you.

1:16:48.179 --> 1:16:49.445
Courtney.

1:16:49.447 --> 1:16:50.679
Courtney, come on!
Just slow down.

1:16:50.681 --> 1:16:52.247
Give me a second
for God's sake.

1:16:52.249 --> 1:16:54.516
Time travel?!

1:16:56.253 --> 1:16:58.253
You've been you
this entire time?

1:16:58.255 --> 1:16:59.822
You travelled through time

1:16:59.824 --> 1:17:01.757
and you didn't think
to tell me

1:17:01.759 --> 1:17:03.625
the second
you figured it out?!

1:17:03.627 --> 1:17:05.094
I didn't know
how to tell ya.

1:17:05.096 --> 1:17:07.796
James.

1:17:07.798 --> 1:17:12.368
How could this possibly be
what you end up like?

1:17:12.370 --> 1:17:16.739
Well, I'm gonna try
to take that as a compliment.

1:17:19.710 --> 1:17:22.111
I... I just can't.

1:17:48.305 --> 1:17:50.272
I don't know, I don't know.

1:17:54.645 --> 1:17:57.079
What if you are my future?

1:17:59.050 --> 1:18:02.017
Like maybe...

1:18:02.019 --> 1:18:04.286
maybe you do come
to CERN with me.

1:18:05.890 --> 1:18:09.224
Sometimes people meet
at the wrong time.

1:18:09.226 --> 1:18:12.327
Like... maybe I was always
supposed to meet you

1:18:12.329 --> 1:18:14.663
at this age.

1:18:14.665 --> 1:18:16.765
No.

1:18:16.767 --> 1:18:18.934
I've seen your future.

1:18:18.936 --> 1:18:21.003
And believe me,

1:18:21.005 --> 1:18:24.006
being with a 60-year-old
time travelling paradox

1:18:24.008 --> 1:18:27.376
is... not an upgrade.

1:18:27.378 --> 1:18:29.411
No, you have so
many incredible things

1:18:29.413 --> 1:18:31.747
that are gonna happen
to you.

1:18:39.090 --> 1:18:40.989
Do you know how long
I've been in love with you?

1:18:47.698 --> 1:18:49.264
I blew it.

1:18:51.569 --> 1:18:53.802
I blew it so bad.

1:18:57.775 --> 1:19:01.076
Turns out I'm too stupid...

1:19:01.078 --> 1:19:02.478
to deserve you.

1:19:05.916 --> 1:19:07.583
That's why you're gonna go.

1:19:07.585 --> 1:19:10.385
You're gonna go to CERN
on your own,

1:19:10.387 --> 1:19:14.756
because if you stay here...

1:19:14.758 --> 1:19:16.692
nothing's gonna change.

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:24.299
How come you always say
the right thing

1:19:24.301 --> 1:19:26.401
at just the right time?

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:31.673
Because I'm from the future.

1:19:35.746 --> 1:19:38.881
And I sure as shit got it wrong
the first time around.

1:19:41.485 --> 1:19:43.986
Don't tell me how it ends.

1:20:20.558 --> 1:20:21.890
Meredith?

1:20:41.745 --> 1:20:43.011
Hello.

1:20:43.013 --> 1:20:45.347
Hey! You picked up.
Thank you.

1:20:45.349 --> 1:20:47.749
I'm kinda busy, James.

1:20:47.751 --> 1:20:49.051
Yeah. No, I know.

1:20:49.053 --> 1:20:50.752
I'm sorry,
I won't keep you.

1:20:50.754 --> 1:20:52.187
I just, uh...

1:20:52.189 --> 1:20:54.389
I wanted to, um...

1:20:54.391 --> 1:20:56.525
Tomorrow is Rowley's
big press conference, you know,

1:20:56.527 --> 1:20:59.895
and I know things
got weird with us

1:20:59.897 --> 1:21:02.531
but I really hope
that, um...

1:21:02.533 --> 1:21:03.865
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1:21:03.867 --> 1:21:05.167
Right.

1:21:07.104 --> 1:21:09.671
Yeah, of course.
No, I know.

1:21:09.673 --> 1:21:12.608
Uh, what time's
your flight?

1:21:12.610 --> 1:21:14.276
You know, maybe
we could just grab...

1:21:14.278 --> 1:21:16.478
- I'm sorry, I um...
- ...a quick breakfast before you go?

1:21:17.514 --> 1:21:20.115
I have to finish packing.

1:21:20.117 --> 1:21:22.017
So...

1:21:22.019 --> 1:21:24.720
Um, another time.

1:21:24.722 --> 1:21:26.622
Like,
maybe you could come back

1:21:26.624 --> 1:21:30.425
as a version of yourself
that has his shit together?

1:21:32.963 --> 1:21:34.730
I'll take your silence
as confirmation

1:21:34.732 --> 1:21:37.466
that Jimmy wasn't playing
a horrible trick on me.

1:21:38.769 --> 1:21:40.469
I really...

1:21:40.471 --> 1:21:42.638
I really wanted to tell you.

1:21:44.975 --> 1:21:46.341
I...

1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:04.559
Smile, James.

1:22:04.561 --> 1:22:07.763
Your whole life
is about to change.

1:22:07.765 --> 1:22:11.667
All my other projects
are irrelevant,

1:22:11.669 --> 1:22:15.404
compared to the work
that we're about to announce.

1:22:15.406 --> 1:22:17.806
I'm gonna shut them down.

1:22:17.808 --> 1:22:21.410
Just close my facility
completely.

1:22:21.412 --> 1:22:24.012
We'll move
into a smaller lab.

1:22:25.349 --> 1:22:27.616
This will afford us
enough capital

1:22:27.618 --> 1:22:31.153
to fund the work
for five years.

1:22:31.155 --> 1:22:34.122
Fi... but we already know
that it takes 12 years.

1:22:34.124 --> 1:22:36.024
No.

1:22:36.026 --> 1:22:38.694
The first time around
it took 12 years,

1:22:38.696 --> 1:22:41.430
but that's because we didn't
know then what we know now,

1:22:41.432 --> 1:22:43.198
that it works!

1:22:45.302 --> 1:22:47.502
You'd be surprised,

1:22:47.504 --> 1:22:51.873
the difference that kind
of confidence makes!

1:22:51.875 --> 1:22:54.576
And tenacity and work ethic.

1:22:55.879 --> 1:22:59.147
Yes but Dr. Rowley,
Jimmy told us

1:22:59.149 --> 1:23:02.951
that we committed everything
to this project.

1:23:02.953 --> 1:23:06.388
All of our time,
all of our efforts.

1:23:06.390 --> 1:23:08.490
All of our energy. We...

1:23:08.492 --> 1:23:09.858
It was all we did!

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:14.129
So we sank our whole lives
into this work,

1:23:14.131 --> 1:23:15.897
for 12 years.

1:23:15.899 --> 1:23:18.567
So, we'll double our efforts.

1:23:18.569 --> 1:23:20.001
Think about it.

1:23:20.003 --> 1:23:22.137
Neither of us is married.

1:23:22.139 --> 1:23:25.407
We don't have family or any
of the baggage whatsoever.

1:23:25.409 --> 1:23:29.077
We don't even have
a single friend between us.

1:23:29.079 --> 1:23:31.346
The only person who even
remotely paid attention to you

1:23:31.348 --> 1:23:35.384
is about to get on a plane.

1:23:35.386 --> 1:23:37.552
There's absolutely nothing
stopping us

1:23:37.554 --> 1:23:40.622
from dedicating every
waking moment to this work.

1:23:44.595 --> 1:23:46.328
Dr. Rowley, it's time.

1:24:01.378 --> 1:24:03.879
Yeah.

1:24:03.881 --> 1:24:05.313
All right, let's go!

1:24:06.884 --> 1:24:09.751
<i>Now boarding at Gate 12,</i>

1:24:09.753 --> 1:24:13.855
<i>flight 394 to Geneva
is now boarding at Gate 12.</i>

1:24:19.396 --> 1:24:20.629
Hi.

1:24:20.631 --> 1:24:21.897
Oh, hi.
Where are you going today?

1:24:21.899 --> 1:24:23.698
Switzerland.

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:25.567
Can you take Leslie?

1:24:25.569 --> 1:24:26.601
It's faster.

1:24:26.603 --> 1:24:27.936
Hi.

1:24:29.706 --> 1:24:30.806
You just made it!

1:24:30.808 --> 1:24:32.073
Thank you.

1:24:32.075 --> 1:24:33.608
Enjoy your flight.

1:24:56.500 --> 1:24:57.933
Hello, everyone,

1:24:57.935 --> 1:25:00.702
and thank you all
for being here today.

1:25:02.973 --> 1:25:05.140
Today I have come here

1:25:05.142 --> 1:25:06.775
to talk about the Rowley
Institute's plans

1:25:06.777 --> 1:25:09.244
for the future.

1:25:09.246 --> 1:25:11.780
For the past several years,
I've been working

1:25:11.782 --> 1:25:14.516
with one of the greatest
scientific minds of our time...

1:25:14.518 --> 1:25:17.252
"time" being
the critical word here.

1:25:18.755 --> 1:25:21.323
For this young man
has developed the key

1:25:21.325 --> 1:25:25.527
to unlocking the very mystery

1:25:25.529 --> 1:25:27.229
of time itself.

1:25:29.266 --> 1:25:32.367
It was Charles Darwin who said,

1:25:32.369 --> 1:25:36.638
"A man who dares
to waste one hour of time

1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:40.342
"has not discovered
the value of life."

1:25:41.512 --> 1:25:42.777
It is my pleasure

1:25:42.779 --> 1:25:45.947
to introduce to you my protégé,

1:25:45.949 --> 1:25:49.184
my discovery,

1:25:49.186 --> 1:25:51.019
my gift to the world.

1:25:52.356 --> 1:25:54.723
A man whose name
will soon reverberate

1:25:54.725 --> 1:25:56.658
throughout
the scientific community

1:25:56.660 --> 1:25:59.060
and far beyond.

1:26:00.864 --> 1:26:02.864
James Dolinsky.

1:26:07.804 --> 1:26:09.104
Shit!

1:26:20.984 --> 1:26:22.484
What are you doing?

1:26:22.486 --> 1:26:24.319
You got a crazy person
with a bow and arrow!

1:26:24.321 --> 1:26:25.554
Get the fuck outta here!

1:26:33.764 --> 1:26:35.096
Edna?

1:26:54.017 --> 1:26:55.850
Edna?

1:27:16.573 --> 1:27:18.273
Edna?

1:28:17.501 --> 1:28:19.668
What...

1:28:19.670 --> 1:28:21.036
What?

1:28:26.710 --> 1:28:29.210
Nice work, shithead.

1:29:24.735 --> 1:29:26.501
Hi.

1:29:28.071 --> 1:29:31.139
Hi...

1:29:41.118 --> 1:29:42.817
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:29:45.255 --> 1:29:46.588
Tear a little piece off.

1:29:48.191 --> 1:29:50.291
What, like this?

1:29:50.293 --> 1:29:51.392
Yeah.

1:29:51.394 --> 1:29:53.194
Just let it melt

1:29:53.196 --> 1:29:55.730
on your tongue.

1:29:55.732 --> 1:29:57.365
Enjoy that moment.

1:29:57.367 --> 1:29:59.300
Don't rush it.

1:30:04.107 --> 1:30:05.740
Holy shit.

1:30:05.742 --> 1:30:08.309
Right?

1:30:08.311 --> 1:30:10.979
This is...

1:30:10.981 --> 1:30:13.448
the best thing
I've ever tasted.

1:30:14.918 --> 1:30:17.485
Yeah.

1:30:17.487 --> 1:30:18.553
Hi.

1:30:18.555 --> 1:30:19.788
Hi.

1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:25.660
I can't believe you're here.
