WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:05.415
Where's Minorca?

00:05.506 --> 00:07.338
Where's the Battle
of the Chesapeake?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.543
If there was a waiting room
for Sophia Cracroft,

00:11.637 --> 00:13.299
would you hang your defeats
for everyone to see?

00:20.229 --> 00:22.687
You know, it may surprise you
to hear me say this,

00:22.773 --> 00:26.187
but... it gives me
great comfort to know that

00:26.276 --> 00:28.609
your uncle is with Francis.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.271
This afternoon,
we'll make our list.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.529
We must see everyone who's
written to us out of concern.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.575
We need to prepare the ground.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.528
There's all sorts of things
we could be organizing.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.035
Oh, and we must make
a special visit to Chester Place

00:41.124 --> 00:42.535
and see the Dickenses.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.868
Charles has
written to me twice.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.500
He could be our very best ally
in times to come.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.879
My dear...

00:51.969 --> 00:54.211
My dear, what is it?

00:54.304 --> 00:56.591
Oh, it's nothing.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.765
It's very wet on your cheeks
to be nothing.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.181
Oh, don't they know
we can hear them?

01:10.279 --> 01:12.521
I have made a horrible mistake,
Auntie.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.117
It's only that I have been
counting the days

01:18.203 --> 01:21.071
since you sent your message
to the whalers in Baffin Bay.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.656
I was sure that you would have
heard word by now.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.241
Oh, yes, two replies, in fact

01:25.335 --> 01:27.327
but, as yet,
no-one has seen either ship.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.414
How far north did your letters
reach, do we know?

01:30.507 --> 01:33.921
Pond Inlet, if that means
anything to you.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.469
Lady Jane had supposed
Bylot Island, in fact.

01:36.555 --> 01:40.048
I had guessed
she was being optimistic.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.392
Not by much, it turns out.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.105
My dears,
everything you can conceive of

01:47.190 --> 01:49.432
is being considered,
but I must remind you,

01:49.526 --> 01:52.018
we've not determined there's
any official cause for alarm.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.276
We have confidence absolute
in your husband's command.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.448
Are you sure that
that's merited?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.110
All of us in this room
know that

02:01.204 --> 02:05.039
John was not your first choice
to lead this expedition.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.367
Nor was he your second.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.124
- I don't see how that...
- Nor even your third.

02:10.213 --> 02:16.050
We all know John. He's...
as wonderful as he's fallible.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.629
I'd rather that we helped him
now and praised him later,

02:19.723 --> 02:23.342
if he has indeed got himself
frozen in somewhere.

02:24.394 --> 02:30.311
We feel that you, gentlemen,
must do more than consider.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.234
You must enact a plan now.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.277
She could not be more correct.

02:36.281 --> 02:40.025
There's no basis for a
determination of anything here.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.826
It's a bald decision,
is it not?

02:42.913 --> 02:46.998
Do we risk unnecessary
expenditure of pounds now,

02:47.084 --> 02:49.076
or of men later?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.710
Thank you, Sir John.

02:52.923 --> 02:57.338
Gentlemen, no doubt
most of you were in London

02:57.427 --> 03:00.295
for that light snow
that we had last month.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.345
One evening after dinner, I
stepped out into our courtyard.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.052
I was without a coat
and even a muffler...

03:09.106 --> 03:13.692
...and I stood in that snow
to see how long I could bear it.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.734
Lady Jane, the ships are provisioned
for another two years...

03:15.821 --> 03:17.437
One hour and a quarter

03:17.531 --> 03:20.114
before I was desperate
to get back indoors again...

03:21.159 --> 03:23.196
...but I made myself stay.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.198
And what's more,
I took off my shoes

03:25.288 --> 03:26.824
and I stood in that wet snow.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.536
Two minutes more. Two minutes,
and then I was done.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.044
Our men have been out there
in unimaginable temperatures

03:37.134 --> 03:39.217
for more than
a million minutes.

03:40.137 --> 03:43.255
No one can convince me
that optimism

03:43.348 --> 03:46.637
or confidence is warm enough.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.062
One's sense of cold is relative
to one's experience. I would remind...

03:51.148 --> 03:53.936
I suspect that therein
lies the problem here.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.564
Most of you gentlemen
have written your memoirs.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.941
I've read them.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.900
The past tense
is a very sturdy thing.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.280
It's earned,

04:05.370 --> 04:09.239
but it does take for granted
that one has survived.

04:09.332 --> 04:14.748
Present is a different case
entirely, and so

04:14.838 --> 04:18.252
I've come here to ask you...
what is your plan?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.879
- And when will it begin?
- Lady Jane...

04:22.220 --> 04:25.759
...I have many friends
on those ships, as you know.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.183
Most of us here do,
and I promise you,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.932
it occupies our thoughts
as much as it does yours.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.604
And I also promise you that

04:33.690 --> 04:37.183
if we have not heard word
from them by 1850,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.143
I shall go and search myself.

04:42.365 --> 04:45.984
Then we will do it... imagine...
what our nation will not.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.069
Fund a ship,
is that what you mean?

04:48.163 --> 04:51.076
Compared to what your uncle
and Francis and the rest of the men

04:51.166 --> 04:53.829
must be managing
this very hour, asking our set

04:53.919 --> 04:57.663
to put down its sherries
to write checks is nothing.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.465
He needs us, Sophia.
I can feel it,

05:01.551 --> 05:05.636
as if he were with us here,
right now, asking.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.307
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.771
Lieutenant Little is asking if

07:24.861 --> 07:27.478
you would like to postpone
the officers' meeting.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.863
What time is it?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.992
It's a minute before four, sir.

07:34.329 --> 07:37.447
We'll proceed at five.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.032
Let them enjoy the birthday.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.709
Party's finished, sir.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.748
First dog watch
has already gone out.

07:51.346 --> 07:55.340
Do you know the headlines...
of the meeting?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.015
Me, sir?

07:57.102 --> 07:59.685
Jopson, you hear everything.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.808
Ah.

08:01.898 --> 08:06.359
Well, uh... Mr. Reid reports
that <i>Erebus</i> is steady,

08:07.404 --> 08:10.067
but <i>Terror's</i> bow
is up another nine inches.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.817
Lieutenant Little is wondering
at what point

08:13.910 --> 08:17.278
we should begin moving Terrors
over to berth on <i>Erebus.</i>

08:18.123 --> 08:20.206
He says
we can take volunteers first,

08:20.291 --> 08:22.499
so as not to overtax
the flagship, sir.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.833
And Lieutenant Irving has
what sounds like

08:26.923 --> 08:29.006
a rather pressing report
on stores.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.084
What about them?

08:31.177 --> 08:35.547
Uh... He's concerned the tinned
food is turning up spoilt, sir.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.008
There's a problem with
the solder on some of the cans.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.303
New kind of process,
apparently.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.016
You see.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.693
Have you ever thought of...

08:49.779 --> 08:51.236
...becoming a newsman?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.281
- Sir...
- Oh, damn it.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.165
Check the stern. Be quick!

09:04.627 --> 09:06.835
Mr. Armitage,
what do you report?

09:06.921 --> 09:08.708
He's still breathing.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.584
- Came over the gunwale, sir.
- Oh, my God.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.420
We didn't see it till it went
back over the side.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.894
That will freeze. Move him
down below immediately.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.562
Private Hammond,
take the watch!

09:32.655 --> 09:34.396
Up!

09:38.661 --> 09:40.823
It's come
onto the ship, Edward.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.083
It's got Strong!
William Strong, sir.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.627
It took him. We heard someone
yelling for help out on the ice

09:48.713 --> 09:50.579
and then we realized
Strong was missing.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.131
Go below, get 30 men into slops
as quick as you can.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.507
Have Mr. Armitage open up
the armory. Shotguns to half.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.588
Sir!

10:01.101 --> 10:03.184
Maybe it wants us
to follow it, sir.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.733
Captain, may I c-come?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.694
- No ship's boys.
- Sir, please.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.282
You'll be with me.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.520
Is Strong a mate of yours?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.518
He's a brick to us boys, sir.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.149
Your muffler, Evans,
pull it up.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.276
You won't even feel
your nose go.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.719
Evans! Come on up!

12:27.372 --> 12:29.159
Evans!

12:31.834 --> 12:33.917
Evans!

13:20.925 --> 13:23.008
The last of the year.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.295
It feels like an omen.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.305
As I climbed the ridge,
I was thinking it.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.015
I could see the pattern,

13:38.109 --> 13:40.476
but I couldn't credit an animal
with having that kind of...

13:40.570 --> 13:43.688
You're saying a bear
staged a misdirection?

13:44.407 --> 13:48.151
I'm saying I ordered
that we split up into pairs

13:48.244 --> 13:50.327
to cover more ground, I did...

13:52.040 --> 13:54.032
...and then I left him.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.582
I only took him with me
because he was scared.

14:06.054 --> 14:09.013
With all you're shouldering,
perhaps you should...

14:09.098 --> 14:11.181
you should curb that for now.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.646
Does one not bring
one's habits to <i>Terror?</i>

14:18.649 --> 14:20.356
Pardon?

14:21.319 --> 14:23.026
Forget it.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.443
Don't let it bother you.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.025
It's not as if we're going
anywhere, is it?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.705
You're in command.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.408
Of what?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.118
You realize that

14:39.212 --> 14:41.750
the discovery of the Passage
is beyond us now.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.206
- It'll be left for someone...
- You don't know that.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.212
If the ships are still afloat
come spring,

14:46.302 --> 14:50.216
we will have to retreat
to open water and rescue.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.263
Even with
Lieutenant Fairholme's help,

14:52.350 --> 14:55.093
should you return in time,
we are not provisioned

14:55.186 --> 14:58.554
- to speculate even a day...
- Why are you here, Francis?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.685
You've never believed in
this cause.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.563
Now...
no one was ordered to this.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.360
We volunteered.
You volunteered.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.483
I was, in fact, ordered.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.066
By whom? Not by the Admiralty.
You were never Barrow's choice.

15:11.160 --> 15:15.996
"Keep Sir John safe...
and ensure his judgment."

15:18.000 --> 15:20.083
Those were my orders.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.714
It's what she asked me to do.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.213
Lady Jane?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.466
No.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.599
I don't owe her a bloody thing.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.354
Sophia.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.481
- Miss Cracroft?
- Mm.

15:47.363 --> 15:52.074
Miss Cracroft who rejected you,
twice as I heard it?

15:55.288 --> 15:56.904
You discussed this?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.123
Yes.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.452
Sir John discussed it with me.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.538
Well, he...

16:06.549 --> 16:10.008
Actually, he regretted
how it had happened.

16:11.554 --> 16:15.173
Francis...
he was burdened by it.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.509
Burdened by the thought of
a third attempt, no doubt.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.273
That's why you're here.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.440
- Good Christ, Francis!
- Ohh...

16:31.073 --> 16:32.564
Keep your pity.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.330
You're gonna need
all the pity you have...

16:45.338 --> 16:47.204
...for what's coming.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.509
Somehow it seems
he is not failing from this injury.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.463
Then let's proceed without delay
in cauterizing the edges of it.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.047
Or are we still
in disagreement there?

16:57.141 --> 16:58.928
We can stop the bleeding,
at least.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.476
No, he's yours.
Do as you will.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.266
But he lives by the minute,
if you ask me.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.395
I see no reason
to keep you both any longer.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.569
- We can do from here.
- I'd like to watch,

17:10.655 --> 17:12.646
if I might, to learn.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.441
All right. Would you heat up
the cauters, please?

17:18.119 --> 17:19.656
Do you have any sealing wax?

17:20.790 --> 17:23.874
- For letters, you mean?
- We can affix the eyes.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.963
In that cupboard there.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.222
It's a pudding, basically.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.524
I would have said,
"cathedral"...

17:52.154 --> 17:54.646
...but I suppose
it depends on the man.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.250
Everybody is so staggered

18:06.335 --> 18:08.748
that he's hanging in there
like that.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.126
He's a Royal Marine.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.334
Now, what the bloody hell
do people think that means?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.887
'Ey? No man here knows but us.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.056
Now, we did not ask to be here.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.927
Do we harp on about it? No.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.478
We get no bonus pay,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.931
yet we step up to tangle
with that thing on the ice,

18:29.025 --> 18:31.108
first in line
and the first cut down.

18:31.193 --> 18:35.028
Corporal Hedges!
Private Daly! Mr. Hickey!

18:35.114 --> 18:38.278
Mr. Wilson! Seaman Crispe!
And Seaman Walker!

18:38.367 --> 18:40.484
Next bell's your watch!

18:40.578 --> 18:42.695
- Look out for yourself.
- Oh, I will.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.495
Who's that?

20:21.804 --> 20:24.888
Crispe, get below!
Alert command now!

20:24.974 --> 20:26.636
The Eskimo Girl.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.218
They said you spotted her camp
from the last sledge party.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.894
- What of it?
- Tell me where you found it.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.098
Exactly where you found it.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.402
<i>It's two men, sir.</i>

20:43.492 --> 20:46.280
<i>Bottom half is Thomas Evans...</i>

20:46.370 --> 20:48.487
<i>I know who it is.</i>

20:48.581 --> 20:50.413
<i>Despite how
sharp this line of separation,</i>

20:50.499 --> 20:53.492
<i>this was not done with a blade.</i>

20:53.586 --> 20:55.669
<i>This was a single claw.</i>

20:59.341 --> 21:01.708
They're not mad swipes, either.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.258
Whatever did that...
made the first cut,

21:05.347 --> 21:08.590
then made a second
directly above it...

21:09.560 --> 21:11.597
...and then a third
until it was through.

21:11.687 --> 21:15.931
Someone... Someone using
a claw, then, as an instrument?

21:16.025 --> 21:19.109
There's more strength in those
cuts than a man could muscle, sir.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.938
There's the matter
of the prints also, sir.

21:22.031 --> 21:26.366
We found the creature's track
circling <i>Terror.</i> No others.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.408
- No Esquimaux boots?
- Only Navy issue,

21:30.498 --> 21:32.160
and none near the stern.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.836
Not a man. Not a bear.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.963
Then, what?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.218
Perhaps it would not
be a mystery to

21:49.308 --> 21:51.516
- the indigenous people here.
- Indeed.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.637
If only there was one
we could ask.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.147
That Eski girl's been camped
near us for five months,

21:58.234 --> 21:59.816
and we have
no understanding as to why.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.985
I agree with James.

22:02.071 --> 22:05.314
We should bring her here...
and, to the degree

22:05.407 --> 22:09.367
that Dr. MacDonald,
Mr. Blanky, and myself are able,

22:09.453 --> 22:11.536
question her.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.661
Prepare a party to find her
in the morning.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.038
- Yes, sir.
- The Morning? Enough is enough.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.166
The bear came when she came,
and by most accounts,

22:21.257 --> 22:23.670
these people are covetous,
treacherous, cruel...

22:23.759 --> 22:25.876
I've ordered her found, James.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.257
- It's what I can do for now.
- That we cannot

22:28.347 --> 22:32.011
discern a connection between
the girl and this thing

22:32.101 --> 22:33.558
does not mean there isn't one.

22:33.644 --> 22:36.728
I'm not sending men out
into a squall! Not tonight.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.312
They're exhausted.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.363
We're all exhausted.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.448
Gentlemen,
do without me for a moment.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.975
<i>I have no intention
of becoming a captain's wife.</i>

23:16.645 --> 23:20.434
I've seen that life,
and it's not one I aspire to.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.265
I'd make you happy.

23:23.652 --> 23:27.066
- I do make you happy.
- You do...

23:28.407 --> 23:30.694
...but your station does not.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.910
As unkind as that may seem now,

23:33.996 --> 23:37.410
it will spare you
my resentment later.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.451
I know with you I can be plain.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.457
With me, you've never hesitated
to be plain.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.756
When you're not here,
it's because you are gone for years

23:46.842 --> 23:49.084
in the world's
most perilous of corners.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.342
When you are here, you're on 14
shillings Royal Navy half-pay

23:52.431 --> 23:55.344
and mourning every second
on dry land.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.426
False.

23:57.519 --> 24:01.308
There's nowhere in the world
I'd rather be than here now.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.855
I have seen your rooms.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.313
You haven't been on a ship
in nearly a year...

24:11.700 --> 24:14.784
...but in your dresser of ten
drawers, you use only two.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.487
Why?

24:17.581 --> 24:19.573
Habit.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.660
Does one not bring
his habits to marriage?

24:24.546 --> 24:27.004
I will use as many drawers
as you require.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.801
I will not always be a captain.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.633
You are Irish.
You're middle-bred.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.683
The Church of England
gives you hives.

24:39.770 --> 24:43.013
You have no ear
or taste for politics...

24:43.107 --> 24:45.941
The Admiralty will not
refuse me a third time.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.313
They will give me
a full command.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.021
And will it be south again,
or north,

24:51.115 --> 24:52.856
this command of yours?

24:52.950 --> 24:57.035
In whichever direction
leads the altar, Miss Cracroft.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.117
Though I expect
it will be north.

25:00.958 --> 25:04.042
There's talk again of trying
to find the Passage.

25:07.423 --> 25:12.043
I will never understand
this mania for the Passage.

25:13.262 --> 25:17.051
To go thousands of miles
to a place that wants you dead.

25:19.768 --> 25:26.186
I will go to sea once more
as a first and be knighted for it,

25:26.275 --> 25:30.235
then I will retire
to live out my years with you.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.734
- That will not happen.
- It must.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.442
Nothing else will do.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.782
Well, then,

25:40.873 --> 25:44.708
this will be the great tragedy
of your life, Francis.

25:44.793 --> 25:48.753
Dearest, you should dress.
Your uncle is already down.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.965
Mr. Hickey is now missing.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.217
- Missing?
- And possibly two of the seamen.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.969
What is going on?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.971
Get the captain!

26:13.155 --> 26:15.067
Make way! Make way!

26:18.994 --> 26:21.281
If it wasn't for us
being downwind of them,

26:21.371 --> 26:23.579
that would've been it
for us too.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.702
Do it, then.
Cut her in half as well.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.581
Listen, we brought her here
to be questioned by the captain.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.662
Now, let us go down!

26:37.679 --> 26:39.591
Everyone on their knees
right now!

26:39.681 --> 26:41.673
On your knees!

26:53.195 --> 26:55.608
There'll be no violence
towards this woman

26:55.697 --> 26:59.111
without charges brought
and well proved.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.824
I will not tolerate hysteria.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.323
Marines at attention.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.285
Anyone who even looks like
they're considering

27:10.379 --> 27:13.042
ignoring that order,
arrest them!

27:14.299 --> 27:16.541
Who's responsible for this?

27:19.263 --> 27:22.006
- Who is responsible for this?
- I am, sir.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.829
Captain Fitzjames
and Mr. Blanky will escort

27:50.919 --> 27:52.831
the Eskimo Woman to the <i>Erebus,</i>

27:52.921 --> 27:56.005
where she will be made
comfortable and safe.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.219
Till further order.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.219
The three of you will be
questioned below immediately.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.352
The rest of the men
will disperse

28:09.438 --> 28:11.430
to holystone the lower deck.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.855
That is not all for tonight,

28:15.944 --> 28:17.936
but that is all for now.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.864
Dismiss.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.033
Come on.

28:55.609 --> 28:58.226
Hartnell here was
the first to top the ridge

28:58.320 --> 29:00.528
closest to the girl's camp.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.405
He ducked back down
immediately.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.074
He gestured us to be still.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.992
I climbed past him and looked.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.163
Now, we were about 200 yards away
from the girl's snow house.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.874
That's when I saw
it was there too.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.583
The wind was blowing
the snow in our eyes.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.417
For a moment, I thought the girl
had built two snow houses,

29:21.510 --> 29:23.422
but then the thing sat up.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.925
And can you
speak to its size?

29:27.349 --> 29:30.092
Three times the height
of any bear we've seen...

29:31.687 --> 29:34.896
...with a different set
to its head...

29:37.025 --> 29:38.436
...its eyes...

29:38.527 --> 29:40.769
You saw its eyes, Mr. Hickey?

29:40.862 --> 29:44.321
The girl was stood nose-to-nose
with it, just about.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.991
You could see its breath

29:47.077 --> 29:49.694
blowing the seal fur
on her hood.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.956
And she had her hands out,
like so.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.210
Like some kind of...

29:59.047 --> 30:00.709
...spell, or something.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.628
I watched
to see what she meant to do,

30:03.719 --> 30:06.052
- but it spooked and ran off.
- Really?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.222
- Something spooked it?
- Yeah, it wasn't us that did.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.220
It was when the girl
tried speaking to it.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.177
So I figured she was telling it...

30:14.271 --> 30:16.263
You were told not to speculate.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.847
I thought you should be the one

30:17.941 --> 30:20.399
deciding what happens next,
not her.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.319
Now, I know
it wasn't by the book,

30:23.405 --> 30:25.738
but I figured we would lose
our chance to grab her

30:25.824 --> 30:27.861
if we didn't act.

30:27.951 --> 30:32.161
Which is why I got Mr. Manson
and Mr. Hartnell to go along.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.332
And what of the bear's eyes?

30:40.422 --> 30:42.084
When it spooked and run,

30:42.174 --> 30:43.915
it looked in our direction.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.380
It looked at me, sir.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.380
Right at me.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.466
But it didn't rush me.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.177
It went south.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.845
Captain Crozier,
there's something I wanna say,

30:57.939 --> 30:59.931
but I hardly dare
speak the words.

31:00.025 --> 31:03.189
- Speak the words, Mr. Hickey.
- Well...

31:03.278 --> 31:07.067
of all I know in this world...
and of this world...

31:08.116 --> 31:10.324
I tell you, I...

31:12.746 --> 31:15.580
...I do not believe
it is an animal we battle.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.748
Yes, Mr. Hickey.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.250
We know.

31:21.088 --> 31:24.707
The three of you had no orders
to leave your posts,

31:24.800 --> 31:30.216
or the ship...
or to subdue the Netsilik girl.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.719
You have, therefore,
committed several acts

31:34.810 --> 31:40.431
desertion, dereliction of duty,

31:40.524 --> 31:46.316
insubordination, brutality,
disrespect...

31:46.405 --> 31:49.148
I really have my pick here,
don't I?

31:49.241 --> 31:52.405
- Disrespect to who, sir?
- Be silent, Mr. Hickey.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.281
12 lashes for each of you...

31:55.789 --> 31:58.156
...to be delivered before
the ship's company

31:58.250 --> 32:01.584
by Mr. Johnson as soon as
he's finished tying a new cat.

32:02.379 --> 32:06.293
In addition, you'll be
permanently on six-water.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.258
And, though you will not be
dis-rated, you will have

32:09.344 --> 32:13.133
general duty owing
until I see fit to lift it.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.934
What do you say, gentlemen?

32:19.020 --> 32:22.604
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, a full court martial

32:22.691 --> 32:25.058
is technically required
when a ship is lost.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.610
Bring me a chart and I'll show
you exactly where we are.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.279
- Disrespect to who, sir?
- To the girl.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.116
And now to me.

32:34.202 --> 32:37.320
But she directs it. You should
be prosecuting her,

32:37.414 --> 32:39.201
- not us who brought her...
- 20 for him.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.782
I mean, I might
have just ended this thing, sir.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.458
She's had it kill one lieuten...

32:42.544 --> 32:43.876
- 30, then.
- A Marine, Sir John...

32:43.962 --> 32:46.625
I mean, whose name do you think's
on that witch's tongue next?

32:46.715 --> 32:48.707
I just saved your life!

32:56.975 --> 33:00.685
Lieutenant Little...
tell Mr. Johnson

33:00.770 --> 33:04.059
that Mr. Hickey will be
punished as a boy.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.562
<i>All hands assemble
for punishment!</i>

33:12.616 --> 33:14.699
All hands assemble!

33:17.120 --> 33:20.579
- Will it hurt?
- Yes, Manson,

33:20.665 --> 33:23.408
very much.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.540
That's the point.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.759
For the crimes
of insubordination...

33:35.138 --> 33:39.724
...neglect of duty,
disrespect, brutality,

33:39.809 --> 33:43.177
kidnapping, and dirtiness...

33:44.773 --> 33:47.060
...Petty Officer
Cornelius Hickey

33:47.150 --> 33:51.815
will be flogged 30 lashes...
as a boy.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.293
Again.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.280
Again.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.536
Again!

36:28.770 --> 36:30.762
The <i>Terror</i> may be at risk, men.

36:33.108 --> 36:37.978
She sits on a pressure ridge
which is becoming precarious.

36:38.947 --> 36:42.566
Any crew who would
like to berth on <i>Erebus</i>

36:42.659 --> 36:47.120
until the situation
has resolved may do so.

36:48.289 --> 36:51.748
Those of you who remain aboard
will be permitted

36:51.835 --> 36:55.749
to trade up a quarter
of your rations for extra grog.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.581
That is all.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.712
You settle yourself, lad.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.295
We need to clean and salt you,
then we'll dress these wounds.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.403
Has the pain traveled at all?

37:26.119 --> 37:29.703
No, sir, it's just stuck here.

37:31.332 --> 37:34.666
Well, at least you're spared it
being day-bright outside.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.918
If you are still awake
when this dries out,

37:40.008 --> 37:42.045
Mr. Goodsir
will give you another one.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.301
He'll give you a shot of
Mandragora as well.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.633
I think you'll be sleeping like
Endymion within the hour.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.970
And I am mixing up
my Latin and my Greek,

37:54.063 --> 37:57.056
Mr. Morfin, which means
it is past my bedtime.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.903
- Dr. Stanley.
- Sir.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.985
I will brief the officers
in the morning,

38:09.078 --> 38:11.821
but there's been
an incident on <i>Terror.</i>

38:12.874 --> 38:15.332
- Men were lashed.
- We are...

38:17.545 --> 38:20.913
We're billeting the Esquimaux
girl here for now.

38:21.925 --> 38:26.340
When you're finished, will you
see that she's fine and fed?

38:26.429 --> 38:28.421
Of course, sir.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.507
Is there anything
that you need?

38:33.561 --> 38:34.972
Sleep.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.231
Good night, sir.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.478
Well, much as
I'd thrill at the notion of

38:44.572 --> 38:46.655
feeding biscuits and soup
to an Eski,

38:46.741 --> 38:48.528
I turn that task to you,
Mr. Goodsir.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.118
I know you dream
of such things.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.507
I hope the <i>Terror</i> lads
are all right.

39:09.430 --> 39:13.140
Have you ever...
been lashed, sir?

39:14.269 --> 39:16.261
No.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.890
Good Lord, Morfin!

39:21.442 --> 39:23.229
Have you?

39:24.445 --> 39:26.437
Only once, sir.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.231
For what infraction?

39:31.286 --> 39:33.369
Well, what do you think, sir?

39:40.253 --> 39:41.994
Drink it all.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.885
Ah!

39:49.971 --> 39:51.963
Just, uh...

39:53.016 --> 39:54.723
Just a moment please, Morfin...

41:34.242 --> 41:36.700
What is it, John?

41:36.786 --> 41:38.823
I'm very tired.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.996
I apologize, sir.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.823
Lieutenant Little
wanted me to see

41:42.917 --> 41:45.000
if you needed anything more.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.871
And to tell you
he took a poll of the men,

41:48.965 --> 41:51.673
to see which of them
volunteers to billet on <i>Erebus</i>

41:51.759 --> 41:54.001
until <i>Terror's</i> situation
is resolved.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.506
All but ten, sir.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.466
I was expecting
Corporal Paterson

42:35.553 --> 42:37.715
or one of the Marines, sir.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.388
Captain Fitzjames
wanted an officer here.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.558
For the first night.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.803
What do you need, Mr. Goodsir?

42:45.897 --> 42:47.980
I, uh...

43:27.188 --> 43:28.770
That's a meal as good as

43:28.856 --> 43:31.519
you'd get at the Ladies
Grill Room at the Holborn...

43:32.944 --> 43:34.936
...in, in London, where we live.

44:13.943 --> 44:15.900
Food.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.070
Dinner, in fact.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.322
Goodsir.

44:24.412 --> 44:26.074
Harry Goodsir.

44:32.753 --> 44:36.497
I... I heard what happened
to you tonight from Mr. Blanky.

44:36.591 --> 44:40.676
I... I'm sorry... for all of it.

44:42.346 --> 44:46.716
He told me your language
is called Inuktitut...

44:48.019 --> 44:51.353
...and this region here
is called Nunavut.

44:51.439 --> 44:55.604
"Inuktitut" and "Nunavut".
I like those words very much.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.361
I'd like to learn more.

45:01.616 --> 45:04.654
I don't know what's
happening here, I truly don't.

45:05.703 --> 45:08.286
This is...
This is not how Englishmen act.

45:08.372 --> 45:11.991
I... I... I don't recognize
this behavior.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.215
You must wonder
what we're doing here

45:20.301 --> 45:22.042
in your part of the world.

45:22.136 --> 45:24.048
Um...

45:24.138 --> 45:26.471
We are from England.

45:28.517 --> 45:31.009
Nunavut. England.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.225
Very far away.

45:36.609 --> 45:41.479
We've come here to find a way
through to China and India.

45:43.074 --> 45:47.318
Uh... a victory for the Empire,
it would be, to find a way.

45:49.205 --> 45:50.821
A passage.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.790
A northwest passage.

45:56.879 --> 45:58.745
For our economy.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.833
For trade.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.696
Goodsir.
