00:09.959 --> 00:12.500
- We are on fire this month.

00:12.542 --> 00:14.959
We've already got our

00:12.542 --> 00:14.959
Sunshine Girl kayaking badge,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.291
oh, our cookie selling badge,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.291
our community service badge.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.125
- If you call cleaning out your

00:18.333 --> 00:21.125
mom's car community service.

00:21.166 --> 00:23.250
- Hey, I said you could keep

00:21.166 --> 00:23.250
anything you found.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.750
- I got 32 cents

00:23.291 --> 00:25.750
and a hard French fry.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.917
- Dibs!

00:28.959 --> 00:31.417
This one isn't hard.

00:31.458 --> 00:33.375
This one's hard!

00:33.417 --> 00:35.125
Ow, ow.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.458
[horn honks]

00:35.166 --> 00:37.458
- That's my mom.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.166
Bye, Sunshine Sisters.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.792
all: Whoo-dee-whoo-dee-

00:39.208 --> 00:41.792
whoo-wah!

00:41.834 --> 00:43.375
- Bye.

00:43.417 --> 00:44.583
- Bye.

00:43.417 --> 00:44.583
- See you later.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.208
- My two favorite scouts

00:46.250 --> 00:47.417
and their fearless

00:46.250 --> 00:47.417
troop leader.

00:47.458 --> 00:50.000
Get in here.

00:47.458 --> 00:50.000
[all chuckle]

00:50.041 --> 00:52.041
See how happy they look

00:50.041 --> 00:52.041
with all their badges?

00:52.083 --> 00:53.625
Just think,

00:52.083 --> 00:53.625
if you guys were scouts,

00:53.667 --> 00:55.250
you'd be in on this hug too.

00:55.291 --> 00:56.750
[grumbling]

00:56.792 --> 00:58.291
- Not into it.

00:56.792 --> 00:58.291
- No thanks.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.625
- No time.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.834
- [scoffs]

00:59.667 --> 01:00.834
What do you mean?

01:00.875 --> 01:02.291
All you have is time.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.875
When I was painting

01:02.333 --> 01:03.875
that fence earlier,

01:03.917 --> 01:05.583
you stood there and literally

01:03.917 --> 01:05.583
watched it dry.

01:05.625 --> 01:06.750
- That's only because

01:05.625 --> 01:06.750
we were finished

01:06.792 --> 01:08.250
watching the grass grow.

01:08.291 --> 01:10.458
- Yeah, right after we finished

01:08.291 --> 01:10.458
watching you cut it.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.625
- [sighs] Boys, there is

01:10.500 --> 01:13.625
a long tradition of Honor Scouts

01:13.667 --> 01:14.750
in our family.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.083
I was an Honor Scout.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.500
My father was an Honor Scout.

01:17.542 --> 01:18.917
His father was an Honor Scout.

01:18.959 --> 01:20.792
- That seems long enough.

01:20.834 --> 01:23.667
- Your father even bought you

01:20.834 --> 01:23.667
Honor Scout uniforms years ago,

01:23.709 --> 01:27.083
just hoping for the day you'd

01:23.709 --> 01:27.083
get bitten by the scout bug.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.792
- Sorry, Dad.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.792
We're just not scout people.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.875
- Fine.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.875
No internet for a month.

01:32.917 --> 01:34.500
all: What?

01:32.917 --> 01:34.500
- I meant for me!

01:34.542 --> 01:37.792
I'm a failure as a father,

01:34.542 --> 01:37.792
and I don't deserve it.

01:39.417 --> 01:42.208
- Look, I bet you guys

01:39.417 --> 01:42.208
would love being scouts.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.208
Last month we did

01:42.250 --> 01:44.208
a ton of fun stuff.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.375
Like, we went hiking--

01:45.417 --> 01:46.125
- I'm out.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.709
- You guys should

01:47.542 --> 01:49.709
give it a chance.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.458
- Would we get to play with

01:49.750 --> 01:52.458
this fancy poking stick?

01:52.500 --> 01:54.583
- That's not

01:52.500 --> 01:54.583
a fancy poking stick.

01:54.625 --> 01:56.041
- Yeah, sure it is.

01:54.625 --> 01:56.041
- Ow, ow.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.667
Ow, ow, ow.

01:57.709 --> 02:00.041
That is fancy.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.291
- It's not a poking stick.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.500
This is the Sunshine Girls'

02:02.333 --> 02:04.500
Truth Stick.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.250
- We took a sacred

02:04.542 --> 02:06.250
oath of honor

02:06.291 --> 02:08.667
as part of our

02:06.291 --> 02:08.667
Sunshine Sisterhood pact.

02:08.709 --> 02:11.834
The person holding it is always

02:08.709 --> 02:11.834
bound to tell the truth.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.291
- Really?

02:11.875 --> 02:13.291
Can I try?

02:13.333 --> 02:15.125
The Sunshine Girls

02:13.333 --> 02:15.125
don't do anything

02:15.166 --> 02:17.417
that would interest us

02:15.166 --> 02:17.417
in any way.

02:17.458 --> 02:20.375
Hey, it works.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.834
- Hmm, that's too bad.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.166
Because I sold the most

02:22.875 --> 02:25.166
Sunshine Girl cookies,

02:25.208 --> 02:26.500
and won five tickets

02:26.542 --> 02:28.625
to the Ele-Funk Nation

02:26.542 --> 02:28.625
concert on Saturday.

02:28.667 --> 02:29.625
- [gasps]

02:29.667 --> 02:32.667
[both trumpeting]

02:32.709 --> 02:35.250
- We love Ele-Funk.

02:32.709 --> 02:35.250
Check out my shirt.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.834
- Yeah, we'd love to go.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.667
- That's why I suggested to Mae

02:37.875 --> 02:40.667
that she takes all of us.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.291
- Yes.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.291
- Sweet.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.667
- Now that's what being a quad

02:42.333 --> 02:43.667
is all about.

02:43.709 --> 02:44.834
Thanks, Dawn.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.458
- But...since you guys

02:47.500 --> 02:50.625
have no interest in what

02:47.500 --> 02:50.625
the Sunshine Girls do, then--

02:50.667 --> 02:54.250
- Ah, the truth is we were wrong

02:50.667 --> 02:54.250
about the Sunshine Girls.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.500
They're great.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.500
- Yes, please forgive us.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.417
We will never doubt

02:56.542 --> 02:59.417
the Sunshine Girls again.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.667
- I was the one who tried

02:59.458 --> 03:01.667
to flush a watermelon

03:01.709 --> 03:02.834
down the toilet.

03:02.875 --> 03:06.041
Get this thing away from me!

[glass shatters]

03:07.291 --> 03:09.291
It wasn't me.

Don't let me

03:09.333 --> 03:10.709

03:10.750 --> 03:14.250

03:57.500 --> 04:00.667

Honey, maybe we should go.

to the concert.

04:19.458 --> 04:21.208

- We cannot be seen with her

04:21.250 --> 04:24.458

04:30.917 --> 04:34.208
if you don't like it,

04:34.250 --> 04:37.208
you should tell Dawn

04:34.250 --> 04:37.208
how you really feel.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.375
- Yeah, so we don't have

04:37.250 --> 04:40.375
to go to the concert

04:40.417 --> 04:43.083
with you looking like that.

04:43.125 --> 04:45.750
And because we care

04:43.125 --> 04:45.750
about your feelings.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.250
- I get it.

04:47.291 --> 04:48.792
Even I wouldn't want

to be seen with me.

But I can't tell Dawn.

You know how she is when

she gets an idea in her head.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.208
- Oh, yeah.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.208
- She can be pushy.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.208
- I didn't say pushy.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.208
- But we know what you meant.

- Mae, you're her

04:57.250 --> 04:58.583
best friend.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.125
You need to be honest

04:58.625 --> 05:00.125
with her

05:00.166 --> 05:01.625
and tell her

05:00.166 --> 05:01.625
just like you told us

05:01.667 --> 05:02.917
that you think she's pushy.

- Mae doesn't love it.

05:22.709 --> 05:25.000
- What are you talking about?

05:22.709 --> 05:25.000
Of course she loves it.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.250
I think I know my best friend.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.291
Right, Mae?

- Mae.

- Mae?

05:35.417 --> 05:36.458

- Mae!

05:37.500 --> 05:38.583
- Uh...

05:38.625 --> 05:40.000
- I got this.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.250
Mae!

05:43.667 --> 05:45.792
I thought I had it.

05:45.834 --> 05:49.208
- No, I got this.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.875
The truth, Mae.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.750
- Ugh, I don't like it.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.125
There, I said it.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.792
- Then why would you

05:55.166 --> 05:56.792
lie to me earlier

05:56.834 --> 05:57.875
and tell me

05:56.834 --> 05:57.875
you did like it?

05:57.917 --> 05:59.875
- Yeah, why, Mae?

05:59.917 --> 06:01.917
- Because I thought

05:59.917 --> 06:01.917
it would be easier

06:01.959 --> 06:03.709
if I told you

06:01.959 --> 06:03.709
that I liked it.

06:03.750 --> 06:08.375
I lied because sometimes

06:03.750 --> 06:08.375
you can be a little...

06:08.417 --> 06:09.542
pushy.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.125
- Pushy?

06:11.166 --> 06:13.375
I'm not pushy.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.375
How am I pushy?

06:13.417 --> 06:15.583
- Did I say pushy?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.417
You're pushy.

06:18.458 --> 06:19.667
- Wow.

06:19.709 --> 06:21.917
What else have I

06:19.709 --> 06:21.917
pushed you into?

06:21.959 --> 06:24.125
- Nothing, nothing.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.750
- Was it when we dressed

06:24.166 --> 06:25.750
as peanut butter and pickles

06:25.792 --> 06:27.166
for Halloween?

06:27.208 --> 06:29.083
- Uh...

06:31.875 --> 06:34.083
Everyone knows pickles

06:31.875 --> 06:34.083
don't go with peanut butter.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.208
It's peanut butter

06:34.125 --> 06:35.208
and jelly.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.750
I should have been jelly!

06:36.792 --> 06:38.500
- I see.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.375
Well, I'm not going

06:38.542 --> 06:40.375
to a concert

06:40.417 --> 06:42.500
with someone who can't

06:40.417 --> 06:42.500
be truthful.

06:42.542 --> 06:45.000
Peanut butter, out!

06:45.041 --> 06:46.458
Oh, and the boys

06:45.041 --> 06:46.458
aren't going either.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.625
all: What?

06:47.667 --> 06:49.709
- Whoa, PB, settle down.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.625
- Well, I don't want to go with

06:52.125 --> 06:54.625
someone who's so pushy anyway.

06:54.667 --> 06:55.917
Pickles, out.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.333
Wait, scratch that.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.333
Jelly, out.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.834
This is so well made.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.750
- Thank you!

07:03.792 --> 07:05.291
Um, I'm storming out

07:03.792 --> 07:05.291
over here.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.667
How 'bout you storm out

07:05.333 --> 07:07.667
over there?

07:07.709 --> 07:09.917
- Fine, I don't want to

07:07.709 --> 07:09.917
storm out that way anyway.

07:09.959 --> 07:14.000
[both grunt]

07:14.041 --> 07:16.583
- Did we just lose

07:14.041 --> 07:16.583
our concert tickets?

07:16.625 --> 07:18.625
- Did we just ruin

07:16.625 --> 07:18.625
Dawn and Mae's friendship?

07:18.667 --> 07:20.333
- Did we just get hungry

07:20.375 --> 07:22.583
for peanut butter

07:20.375 --> 07:22.583
and pickle sandwiches?

07:22.625 --> 07:24.417
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

07:27.083 --> 07:28.750
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

07:28.792 --> 07:30.959
- I can't believe

07:28.792 --> 07:30.959
we're going to miss

07:31.000 --> 07:33.083
the greatest concert ever.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.375
- Well, maybe

07:33.125 --> 07:34.375
we shouldn't worry.

07:34.417 --> 07:35.750
This is Dawn and Mae

07:34.417 --> 07:35.750
we're talking about.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.250
They're BFFs.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.250
It'll blow over.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.625
- Hey, is that your box

07:40.250 --> 07:42.625
of Mae memories?

07:42.667 --> 07:44.041
- It was.

07:44.083 --> 07:47.375
And now it's in

07:44.083 --> 07:47.375
the "Maeste" basket.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.875
- Wait, Dawn,

07:47.417 --> 07:49.875
you don't want to throw

07:49.917 --> 07:51.792
your friendship with Mae away.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.625
[straining]

07:54.667 --> 07:56.834
- Really, dude?

07:59.875 --> 08:02.166
Oh.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.166
Ooh!

08:02.208 --> 08:04.041
How many friendship rocks

08:02.208 --> 08:04.041
are in here?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.917
- Friendship rocks?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.917
None.

08:05.959 --> 08:09.000
It's just birthday cards

08:05.959 --> 08:09.000
and stuffed animals.

08:09.041 --> 08:12.458
- Help us.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.166
[all straining]

08:14.208 --> 08:15.750
- We're just gonna set this

08:14.208 --> 08:15.750
on the floor.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.875
- Okay, okay.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.625
- [groans]

08:17.917 --> 08:20.625
- Ooh.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.834
- Okay, we have got

08:23.375 --> 08:25.834
to start exercising.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.250
- Dawn, don't do this.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.375
Mae is your best friend.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.375
- [scoffs]

08:30.417 --> 08:32.291
- She's the pickles

08:30.417 --> 08:32.291
to your peanut butter.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.166
- She's the rocks

08:32.333 --> 08:34.166
to your friendship.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.750
- She's the tickets

08:34.208 --> 08:36.750
to our concert.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.333
- Oh, we can still totally

08:36.792 --> 08:39.333
go to that concert.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.583
- Yes.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.583
- Awesome!

08:40.625 --> 08:43.333
- Ele-Funk!

08:40.625 --> 08:43.333
[all trumpeting]

08:43.375 --> 08:45.834
- As soon as Mae apologized

08:43.375 --> 08:45.834
to me for lying

08:45.875 --> 08:49.917
and admits she's wrong

08:45.875 --> 08:49.917
about calling me pushy.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.000
[sad trumpeting]

08:49.959 --> 08:52.000
- Hold on.

08:52.041 --> 08:53.625
Let's keep our trunks up.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.166
[all trumpeting]

08:55.208 --> 08:56.750
We got Mae to confront Dawn.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.875
I'm sure we can get her

08:56.792 --> 08:58.875
to apologize.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.667
- Apologize?

09:00.709 --> 09:02.166
No way!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.000
Dawn should be

09:02.208 --> 09:04.000
apologizing to me.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.792
- Well, you're the one who

09:04.041 --> 09:06.792
told Dawn she was pushy.

09:06.834 --> 09:08.834
- Yeah, maybe you shouldn't

09:06.834 --> 09:08.834
have done that.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.458
- You're the ones

09:08.875 --> 09:10.458
who pushed me

09:10.500 --> 09:12.333
to tell Dawn she was pushy.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.417
You said to be assertive

09:12.375 --> 09:14.417
and stand up to Dawn.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.542
- You should have been assertive

09:14.458 --> 09:17.542
and stood up to us then.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.792
So really this is

09:17.583 --> 09:19.792
all your fault.

09:19.834 --> 09:23.041
- Well, I'm not

09:19.834 --> 09:23.041
apologizing to her.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.625
Apologize.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.625
Mm-hmm.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.542
- Fine, if Mae

09:27.834 --> 09:30.542
won't apologize to Dawn,

09:30.583 --> 09:33.000
we'll get Dawn

09:30.583 --> 09:33.000
to apologize to Mae.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.709
- [laughing hysterically]

09:34.750 --> 09:38.792
Me apologize to her?

09:38.834 --> 09:40.417
I don't think so.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.458
Good one.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.458
- Now we're never gonna

09:46.500 --> 09:48.458
get to that concert.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.166
- Oh, ye of little faith.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.125
If Dawn wants

09:50.208 --> 09:53.125
an apology from Mae,

09:53.166 --> 09:56.125
she's gonna get

09:53.166 --> 09:56.125
an apology from Mae.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.291
[phone rings]

09:57.333 --> 10:00.959
- I'll get it!

10:01.000 --> 10:03.625
Hello.

10:03.667 --> 10:04.959
Oh, hi, Mae.

10:05.041 --> 10:06.458
Dawn, it's Mae.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.417
How are you?

10:08.458 --> 10:10.375
Oh, you have a little bit

10:08.458 --> 10:10.375
of a cold,

10:10.417 --> 10:12.125
so you don't sound

10:10.417 --> 10:12.125
like yourself?

10:12.166 --> 10:15.000
Oh, that's--

10:12.166 --> 10:15.000
that's too bad, Mae.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.917
Dawn, it's Mae.

10:16.959 --> 10:18.375
She has a little bit of a cold,

10:18.417 --> 10:21.834
so she doesn't sound

10:18.417 --> 10:21.834
like herself.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.041
- Mm-hmm.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.792
- Hello, Dawn!

10:24.083 --> 10:26.792
This is Mae.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.750
<i>I'm just calling to tell you</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:30.750
<i>how terribly sorry I am</i>

10:30.792 --> 10:31.875
<i>for lying to you</i>

10:31.917 --> 10:33.959
and saying you were

10:31.917 --> 10:33.959
so pushy.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.458
You are definitely

10:34.000 --> 10:37.458
not pushy.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.667
- I get it, Mae.

10:39.709 --> 10:42.625
You called to mock me

10:39.709 --> 10:42.625
with that insincere apology.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.750
Faking sick and using

10:42.667 --> 10:45.750
that voice you know I hate.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.875
You know, I thought

10:45.792 --> 10:47.875
you were better than that.

10:47.917 --> 10:49.667
Bye, Mae!

10:51.709 --> 10:54.625
- Ooh, some cold, huh?

10:54.667 --> 10:57.083
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

10:57.125 --> 10:58.667
- What's that, Dawn?

10:58.709 --> 11:00.750
You were doing a lot

10:58.709 --> 11:00.750
of screaming at practice

11:00.792 --> 11:02.542
and your voice

11:00.792 --> 11:02.542
is a little hoarse?

11:02.583 --> 11:04.250
Yeah, that's too bad.

11:04.291 --> 11:06.959
Oh, she's right here.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.125
- What?

11:09.166 --> 11:11.709
- Hello, Maeeee.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.291
- Wrong horse.

11:13.333 --> 11:16.417
- Hello, Maeeeee.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.542
- No, she's a little hoarse.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.709
- I got it.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.709
- Okay.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.959
- [high-pitched]

11:20.750 --> 11:23.959
Hello, Maeeee.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.667
- Well, the phone calls

11:24.000 --> 11:26.667
didn't work.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.291
- I'm not sure why.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.500
- You did eight

11:28.333 --> 11:30.500
different horses,

11:30.542 --> 11:32.458
and three of them

11:30.542 --> 11:32.458
were British.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.375
- Oh, you got that, huh?

11:35.417 --> 11:37.834
- Well, let's just hope

11:35.417 --> 11:37.834
this works.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.417
- Hey, guys, what's up?

11:39.458 --> 11:44.583
- Look, Mae baked you

11:39.458 --> 11:44.583
a "Maeke-up" cake.

11:44.625 --> 11:47.917
And isn't it a cute picture

11:44.625 --> 11:47.917
of you two besties?

11:47.959 --> 11:50.000
- Mae knows

11:47.959 --> 11:50.000
I hate this picture.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.917
I mean, I look terrible.

11:51.959 --> 11:53.834
This isn't a make-up cake.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.875
This is a make-fun-of-me cake.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.917
- Wait.

11:58.959 --> 12:02.375
- Wait, no, no, no, no.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.000
- Wait a minute.

12:04.041 --> 12:06.792
We both look terrible.

12:06.834 --> 12:10.917
Mae would never use

12:06.834 --> 12:10.917
this photo to apologize.

12:10.959 --> 12:12.583
What are you three up to?

12:12.625 --> 12:14.792
all: Us three?

12:16.625 --> 12:18.500
- Help, help, help, help!

12:18.542 --> 12:22.333
- Okay, ohhh!

12:18.542 --> 12:22.333
[all groaning]

12:22.375 --> 12:23.750
- Easy, easy.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.750
- I can't get--

12:23.792 --> 12:25.667
- Okay, okay.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.041
- You wouldn't happen

12:25.709 --> 12:27.041
to be trying

12:27.083 --> 12:28.417
to get me and Mae to make up

12:28.458 --> 12:30.125
just so you could go

12:28.458 --> 12:30.125
to the concert?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.792
- That's ridiculous.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.083
- [neighs] Noooo!

12:35.125 --> 12:37.959
- We're quads.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.959
We have a bond.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.917
- That hurts, Dawn.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.917
That hurts.

12:40.959 --> 12:44.417
- Okay, just so we all know

12:40.959 --> 12:44.417
we can trust each other,

12:44.458 --> 12:46.083
let's make a quad pact.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.208
- Sure.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.208
- Why not?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.792
- Yeah, we're up for a pact.

12:48.834 --> 12:49.875
- Great.

12:49.917 --> 12:51.500
Now, let's promise each other

12:51.542 --> 12:53.500
we're gonna stick together

12:51.542 --> 12:53.500
as quads

12:53.542 --> 12:55.667
and none of us are going

12:53.542 --> 12:55.667
to that Ele-Funk concert

12:55.709 --> 12:59.208
under any circumstances.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.291
Quad pact!

13:00.333 --> 13:02.291
all: Quad pact.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.625
- Thank you.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.333
Pushy.

13:05.375 --> 13:08.583
Why would Mae ever get

13:05.375 --> 13:08.583
the idea that I'm pushy?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.250
- You know what?

13:16.291 --> 13:17.709
We can't let Dawn

13:16.291 --> 13:17.709
use a quad pact

13:17.750 --> 13:20.083
to push us around

13:17.750 --> 13:20.083
like we're some...

13:20.125 --> 13:21.709
cake.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.417
We need to take

13:21.750 --> 13:23.417
our own advice

13:23.458 --> 13:24.834
and stand up to her.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.583
both: Yeah!

13:24.875 --> 13:27.583
- Come on.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.667
Dawn, we need

13:27.625 --> 13:29.667
to tell you something.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.083
- Me first.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.417
Look at us.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.959
We've always been a team.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.625
Always standing by each other,

13:35.667 --> 13:37.750
even when we don't agree.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.750
- Speaking of which--

13:37.792 --> 13:40.375
- So I just want to thank you

13:37.792 --> 13:40.375
guys for sticking by me through

13:37.792 --> 13:40.375
this whole Mae thing.

13:40.417 --> 13:43.458
- You know, about that--

13:40.417 --> 13:43.458
- And I'm really sorry

13:40.417 --> 13:43.458
that I doubted you.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.333
You guys are the best brothers

13:43.500 --> 13:46.333
a girl could ever ask for.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.583
[growling]

13:48.625 --> 13:50.709
So you were saying?

13:48.625 --> 13:50.709
all: Nothing.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.542
- Cool.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.542
Thanks again.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.000
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

13:57.667 --> 13:58.917
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

13:58.959 --> 14:00.834
[doorbell chimes]

14:00.875 --> 14:02.291
- Hey, Dawn.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.291
- Hi, Dawn.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.750
- Hey, ladies.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.583
Thanks for coming over

14:03.792 --> 14:05.583
to take my mind off Mae

14:05.625 --> 14:07.208
and tonight's concert.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.125
- About that,

14:07.250 --> 14:09.125
we were thinking

14:09.166 --> 14:10.750
what better way

14:09.166 --> 14:10.750
to take your mind off

14:10.792 --> 14:12.583
not going to the concert,

14:12.625 --> 14:14.041
than by going to the concert?

14:14.083 --> 14:15.041
- With us!

14:15.083 --> 14:16.709
both: We got tickets!

14:16.750 --> 14:18.208
- No way!

14:18.250 --> 14:20.458
We're going to see

14:18.250 --> 14:20.458
Ele-Funk Nation!

14:20.500 --> 14:23.542
[all trumpeting]

14:23.583 --> 14:26.500
[sad trumpeting]

14:26.542 --> 14:28.208
- What's wrong?

14:28.250 --> 14:30.458
- I'm sorry.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.458
I can't go.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.917
I made a quad pact.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.417
My brothers and I

14:31.959 --> 14:33.417
promised each other

14:33.458 --> 14:36.333
that we wouldn't go

14:33.458 --> 14:36.333
to the concert.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.959
[sad trumpeting]

14:41.000 --> 14:42.917
- We are going

14:41.000 --> 14:42.917
to that concert.

14:42.959 --> 14:45.083
- Are we sure we're doing

14:42.959 --> 14:45.083
the right thing?

14:45.125 --> 14:46.667
- Absolutely.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.667
- Then why are we dressed

14:46.709 --> 14:48.667
in these old uniforms

14:48.709 --> 14:52.125
Dad bought us?

14:52.166 --> 14:54.667
- So we could

14:52.166 --> 14:54.667
sneak out of the house.

14:54.709 --> 14:56.709
- But what about

14:54.709 --> 14:56.709
the quad pact?

14:56.750 --> 14:58.291
If we're doing

14:56.750 --> 14:58.291
the right thing,

14:58.333 --> 14:59.583
why do we have to sneak?

14:59.625 --> 15:01.125
- Because part of being a quad

15:01.166 --> 15:02.709
is caring about each other.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.333
And when you care

15:02.750 --> 15:04.333
about each other,

15:04.375 --> 15:06.166
you don't hurt each other.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.166
And if Dawn knew we were going

15:06.208 --> 15:08.166
to the concert without her,

15:08.208 --> 15:09.959
it would hurt her.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.750
And then she would hurt us.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.959
- So we're helping her

15:12.792 --> 15:14.959
not hurt us,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.125
which helps us and her.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.750
Quad pact complete.

15:19.792 --> 15:21.458
- I don't understand it,

15:21.500 --> 15:23.417
but that's never

15:21.500 --> 15:23.417
stopped me before.

15:23.458 --> 15:26.250
Let's roll.

15:26.291 --> 15:27.917
It's hard to roll!

15:27.959 --> 15:28.959
[ripping]

15:29.000 --> 15:30.500
Ah.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.250
Ah, much better.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.667
You guys should do the rip.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.458
- We're fine.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.834
We don't want to look like

15:35.500 --> 15:37.834
idiots with ripped shorts.

15:41.500 --> 15:46.458
Well, off to our very first

15:41.500 --> 15:46.458
Honor Scout meeting.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.709
- Wow, you guys decided

15:46.500 --> 15:49.709
to become Honor Scouts?

15:49.750 --> 15:52.041
- Yeah, I mean, we didn't

15:49.750 --> 15:52.041
have anywhere else

15:52.083 --> 15:53.458
we were going tonight,

15:53.500 --> 15:56.041
since we're honoring

15:53.500 --> 15:56.041
our pact and all.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.834
- What's up

15:56.083 --> 15:57.834
with those uniforms?

15:57.875 --> 15:59.000
- They aren't so tight.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.709
- Then why are your legs blue?

16:01.750 --> 16:02.583
- Our legs aren't blue.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.208
[both gasp, scream]

16:04.250 --> 16:06.291
Our legs are blue!

16:06.333 --> 16:07.792
- Do the rip!

16:06.333 --> 16:07.792
Do the rip!

16:07.834 --> 16:09.500
- All right!

16:07.834 --> 16:09.500
[ripping]

16:09.542 --> 16:12.250
- [both sigh]

16:12.291 --> 16:14.458
- Well, we'll be on our way.

16:18.208 --> 16:21.083
- See? My brothers

16:18.208 --> 16:21.083
are honoring the pact.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.125
I have to, too.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.333
- What about our pact?

16:23.375 --> 16:24.959
- Yeah, we're Sunshine Girls.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.625
We've made a pact to form

16:25.000 --> 16:27.625
a loyal sisterhood.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.333
both: Whoo-dee-whoo-dee-

16:27.667 --> 16:30.333
whoo-wah!

16:30.375 --> 16:32.792
- Oh, don't pull

16:30.375 --> 16:32.792
our secret greeting on me.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.792
Look, I know about our bond.

16:34.834 --> 16:38.500
But my quad bond is stronger.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.583
- Are you sure?

16:40.625 --> 16:43.959
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

16:44.000 --> 16:45.875
- So let me get this straight.

16:45.917 --> 16:49.125
You all decided

16:45.917 --> 16:49.125
to join Honor Scouts tonight?

16:49.166 --> 16:50.375
- Yep.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.125
- And you all sat

16:50.417 --> 16:52.125
on the same cactus

16:52.166 --> 16:54.041
and ripped your pants?

16:54.083 --> 16:58.000
- Well, not at the same time,

16:54.083 --> 16:58.000
but yes.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.000
- And this isn't something

16:58.041 --> 17:00.000
you cooked up

17:00.041 --> 17:02.792
to get out of a pact you might

17:00.041 --> 17:02.792
have made with your sister?

17:02.834 --> 17:04.125
all: Scout's honor.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.291
- [cawing]

17:06.333 --> 17:09.917
But you probably shouldn't

17:06.333 --> 17:09.917
mention the concert to Dawn.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.542
Uh, don't want to rub it in.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.291
- That's fine.

17:13.333 --> 17:17.417
Until Dawn apologizes to me,

17:13.333 --> 17:17.417
I won't be talking to her.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.458
Oh.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
Oh, now if you'll excuse me,

17:21.542 --> 17:24.583
I'm gonna go get myself

17:21.542 --> 17:24.583
a tusk of nachos.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.250
- Great.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.250
All we have to do

17:28.291 --> 17:30.291
is keep Dawn from ever

17:28.291 --> 17:30.291
apologizing to Mae.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.917
- Should be easy.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.458
Not like they'll ever be

17:31.959 --> 17:34.458
in the same room anytime soon.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.542
- Now that I'm here,

17:36.792 --> 17:38.542
I feel really guilty

17:38.583 --> 17:40.041
about breaking

17:38.583 --> 17:40.041
the quad pact.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.458
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.083
- Come on, Dawn, your brothers

17:41.500 --> 17:44.083
are never gonna know.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.458
They're at a scout meeting

17:44.125 --> 17:46.458
ten miles from here.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.709
- Yeah.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.792
Or ten feet from here.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.792
Look.

17:53.667 --> 17:54.917
- What are they doing here?

17:54.959 --> 17:56.834
- I can't believe it.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.750
I'm gonna go over there and

17:56.875 --> 17:59.750
give them a piece of my mind.

17:59.792 --> 18:02.000
But I won't.

18:02.041 --> 18:06.625
Because I'm not supposed

18:02.041 --> 18:06.625
to be here either.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.667
Ohh, they're looking this way!

18:06.667 --> 18:09.667
Go, go, go, go, go, go, come on.

18:09.709 --> 18:12.834
Stampede, people!

18:09.709 --> 18:12.834
Stampede.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.333
- Push harder

18:12.875 --> 18:15.333
or you're not gonna make it.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.041
- [grunting]

18:20.041 --> 18:22.750
Uh, oh, no.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.750
This is not good.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.375
Natalie, June, I'm stuck.

18:24.417 --> 18:26.792
- We'll meet you upstairs.

18:24.417 --> 18:26.792
- Wait, upstairs?

18:31.625 --> 18:33.667
Okay, relax.

18:33.709 --> 18:36.500
Maybe the boys won't see me.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.458
- Is that Dawn?

18:42.291 --> 18:44.125
- She broke our pact.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.458
- So did we.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.667
- Yeah, but she doesn't

18:45.500 --> 18:47.667
know that.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.875
I'm gonna go over there

18:47.709 --> 18:49.875
and give her a piece of my mind.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.166
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

18:49.917 --> 18:52.166
big fella.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.125
- We're not supposed

18:52.208 --> 18:54.125
to be here either.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.917
All we can do now

18:54.166 --> 18:55.917
is enjoy the concert

18:55.959 --> 18:58.333
and hope she doesn't see us.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.875
- Hey, scouts, one of the herd

18:58.375 --> 19:01.875
is caught in the elevator.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.333
You need to go help.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.500
- Uh...

19:04.542 --> 19:07.667
We're off duty.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.750
- Scouts are never off duty.

19:09.792 --> 19:12.583
- Well, we're home-scouted,

19:09.792 --> 19:12.583
so our rules may be a little--

19:12.625 --> 19:16.583
- You made a sacred scout pact.

19:12.625 --> 19:16.583
Now go. Go, go, go, go.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.417
Hang on, they're coming.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.083
- Okay, we gotta make a pact.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.834
No more pacts.

19:21.875 --> 19:25.959
- Hey, concertgoer in need,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.542
we just came from our

19:26.000 --> 19:29.542
scout meeting to help you.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.583
- Oh!

19:30.625 --> 19:32.291
Dawn?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.250
What are you doing here?

19:34.291 --> 19:36.709
- Oh, you know, just waiting

19:34.291 --> 19:36.709
for the elevator doors to open.

19:36.750 --> 19:40.417
Which they should

19:36.750 --> 19:40.417
any second now.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.875
Or they'll continue

19:40.458 --> 19:43.875
to the floor below.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.875
- No, what are you doing

19:43.917 --> 19:46.875
at the concert?

19:46.917 --> 19:48.542
- You know, I could

19:46.917 --> 19:48.542
ask you the same thing.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.000
In fact, I will.

19:50.041 --> 19:51.625
What are you doing

19:50.041 --> 19:51.625
at the concert?

19:51.667 --> 19:53.375
- Well, we were

19:51.667 --> 19:53.375
at our meeting--

19:53.417 --> 19:56.583
- What? Liars!

19:53.417 --> 19:56.583
You broke the quad pact.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.166
- You broke

19:56.625 --> 19:58.166
the quad pact, too.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.959
Don't get all high and mighty

19:58.208 --> 20:00.959
on us.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.208
- I am not

20:01.000 --> 20:05.208
all high and mighty.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.625
- Well, you lied and said

20:05.250 --> 20:07.625
that you weren't going,

20:07.667 --> 20:08.709
so we couldn't go.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.458
- Yeah, and then you went.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.834
- And you went, too.

20:15.291 --> 20:19.583
Is anybody getting off

20:15.291 --> 20:19.583
on this floor?

20:19.625 --> 20:20.875
- So we're done here?

20:20.917 --> 20:23.625
- Oh, we're not done here.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.625
How could you lie to me?

20:25.667 --> 20:28.250
You said Dawn was okay

20:25.667 --> 20:28.250
with you coming to the concert.

20:28.291 --> 20:29.917
- And you told us

20:28.291 --> 20:29.917
you wouldn't talk about it

20:29.959 --> 20:31.166
in front of Dawn.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.959
So...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.625
- You guys lied to both of us.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.500
That's pretty messed up.

20:38.542 --> 20:41.917

21:01.333 --> 21:03.792

21:03.834 --> 21:04.959
