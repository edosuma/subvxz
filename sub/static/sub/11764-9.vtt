WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.073
G-MAIL, BEER ME!

00:02.073 --> 00:03.274
(whispers) SHH.
(lowered voice) MNH.

00:03.274 --> 00:05.206
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET MY DAUGHTER TO NAP.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.207
(mouths word)

00:06.207 --> 00:08.379
ANDY, STOP THAT TOAST!
(gasps)

00:08.379 --> 00:10.181
(clink)
(lowered voice) OHH. OW.

00:10.181 --> 00:11.642
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

00:13.284 --> 00:17.188
в™Є TWINKLE, TWINKLE,
LITTLE STAR в™Є

00:17.188 --> 00:22.022
(all, lowered voices)
в™Є HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE в™Є

00:22.022 --> 00:25.526
в™Є UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH в™Є

00:25.526 --> 00:29.360
в™Є LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE SKY в™Є

00:29.360 --> 00:33.634
в™Є TWINKLE, TWINKLE,
LITTLE STAR в™Є

00:33.634 --> 00:37.068
в™Є HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE в™Є

00:37.068 --> 00:40.671
(gasps, lowered voice)
WE DID IT.

00:40.671 --> 00:43.414
(cheering)

00:43.414 --> 00:45.045
FACE!
(Tampa cries)

00:45.045 --> 00:48.219
(chuckles) WE'RE DUMB.

00:48.219 --> 00:53.254
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:53.254 --> 00:55.556
(whispers indistinctly)
(door closes)

00:55.556 --> 00:58.089
HEY, DIME EYES.
YOUR BABY MAMA JUST PULLED UP.

00:58.089 --> 01:00.060
WHY IS DUMMY LATE THIS TIME?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.232
MAYBE HOLLY FORGOT
SHE HAD A BABY.

01:01.232 --> 01:02.233
(coos)

01:02.233 --> 01:04.195
SHE'S NOT THAT RIDICULOUS.
(door closes)

01:04.195 --> 01:05.666
HEY, YOU GUYS.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE,

01:05.666 --> 01:07.368
BUT I WAS DRIVING IN
TO THE BOOB DOCTOR,

01:07.368 --> 01:10.101
'CAUSE, UM, I'M THINKING
ABOUT GOING A LITTLE BIGGER.

01:10.101 --> 01:12.203
ACTUALLY,
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER.

01:12.203 --> 01:14.405
(chuckles) I DON'T REALLY CARE.
I JUST NEED A CHANGE...

01:14.405 --> 01:17.208
(laughs) AND I FORGOT
I HAVE THIS BABY.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.210
GRAYSON--
IN YOUR FACE!

01:19.210 --> 01:22.082
I WAS GONNA SAY "IN YOUR FACE."
YOU JUST STOLE MY THUNDER!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.654
YOU'RE A THUNDER STEALER!

01:23.654 --> 01:25.216
THAT'S MY INDIAN NAME.

01:25.216 --> 01:27.288
YOU DO IT AGAIN,
AND WE'RE GOING TO THERAPY.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.419
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

01:28.419 --> 01:30.121
YOU TAKE YOUR FRIENDS
TO THERAPY?

01:30.121 --> 01:31.692
YEAH, IF THEY ANNOY ME.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.095
SO IF TAMPA EVER HAD
A LITTLE BREAK FROM REALITY...

01:35.095 --> 01:37.628
(chuckles) LIKE HER MAMA DID
THAT ONE TIME,

01:37.628 --> 01:39.130
YOU GUYS COULD HELP?

01:39.130 --> 01:42.133
WE WOULD DO ANYTHING,
WHETHER SHE NEEDED OUR TIME

01:42.133 --> 01:43.274
OR OUR MONEY OR...

01:43.274 --> 01:47.107
WHOA. DID YOU JUST SAY...
(chuckles) "OUR MONEY"?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.280
(chuckles) YEAH. WHY?
(chuckling) OH.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.283
OH, NO. PLEASE. PLEASE DON'T--
DON'T MAKE ME GO THERE.

01:52.283 --> 01:54.385
WHY SHOULD I PAY
FOR HIS MISTAKE?

01:54.385 --> 01:56.617
OOH. DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A SKOSH HURTFUL

01:56.617 --> 01:59.119
TO REFER TO HIS CHILD
AS A "MISTAKE"?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.291
WHAT IF I CALLED HER
A "WHOOPSIE"?

02:00.291 --> 02:01.792
(chuckles) I'LL ALLOW IT.

02:01.792 --> 02:02.793
OKAY, THANKS. (chuckles)

02:02.793 --> 02:04.455
GOOD. YOU ARE
SETTING ASIDE EGOISM

02:04.455 --> 02:06.757
TO RESOLVE A SOURCE
OF DISSONANCE.

02:06.757 --> 02:08.429
DON'T BIG-WORD ME, LYNN.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.760
NO, IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.861
I DON'T CARE.

02:10.861 --> 02:11.862
I-I DON'T EITHER.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.264
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.466
I THOUGHT WE'D COMBINE
OUR FINANCES.

02:15.466 --> 02:18.169
SO YOU WANT TO HELP PAY
FOR TRAVIS'S COLLEGE? (chuckles)

02:18.169 --> 02:20.811
SURE. YEAH, EVEN IF
HE GOES TO MED SCHOOL.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.142
WOW.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.474
SO YOU THINK BOBBY AND I COULD
PRODUCE A DOCTOR, HUH?

02:23.474 --> 02:25.476
(both laughing)

02:25.476 --> 02:28.179
BOBBY'S LITERALLY NEVER READ
A BOOK,

02:28.179 --> 02:29.320
AND YESTERDAY I GOT
MY HAND STUCK

02:29.320 --> 02:32.883
IN THE BOTTOM
OF A HONEY-ROASTED PEANUT JAR.

02:32.883 --> 02:34.655
THE SALT AND THE SUGAR
AT THE BOTTOM IS LIKE HEROIN.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.658
LOOK, MONEY IS A HUGE SOURCE
OF CONFLICT IN ANY MARRIAGE.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.661
I MEAN, EVEN WITH MY REGGIE,
MAY HE REST IN PEACE,

02:40.661 --> 02:43.494
UH, MOST OF OUR ARGUMENTS
WERE ABOUT MONEY...

02:43.494 --> 02:47.338
AND HIS PROSTITUTE PROBLEMS,
BUT... (sighs)

02:47.338 --> 02:51.672
ANY GOOD RELATIONSHIP REQUIRES
SHARING EVERYTHING...

02:51.672 --> 02:54.645
(coughs) EVEN S.T.D.s,
BUT ALSO MONEY.

02:54.645 --> 02:55.646
GRAYSON'S RIGHT.

02:55.646 --> 02:57.908
(laughs) OH, YES!

02:57.908 --> 02:59.680
(laughs)
IF YOU WEREN'T MY THERAPIST,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.882
WE WOULD SO BE GOING
TO THERAPY.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.384
(both yawn)

03:03.384 --> 03:05.185
WHERE'S THE COFFEE GRINDER?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.418
UNDER THE SINK.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE STAN IS?

03:07.418 --> 03:11.292
NO, BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD
THAT NEITHER OF US KNOWS.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.523
OH, I REMEMBER
WHERE I PUT HIM.

03:12.523 --> 03:14.395
BOO!
AAH!

03:14.395 --> 03:15.526
(both laugh)

03:15.526 --> 03:18.699
STAN THE MAN!
(grunts) BAM!

03:18.699 --> 03:20.931
BOOM! GIVE ME SOME, BUDDY.

03:20.931 --> 03:23.404
(strained voice) OHH!
(coughs) OHH. CLASSIC.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.237
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS MESS
WITH PEOPLE?

03:26.237 --> 03:27.678
THAT'S HOW I SHOW LOVE.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.240
BUT YOU NEVER SCREW
WITH BOBBY,

03:29.240 --> 03:30.381
AND I KNOW YOU TWO LOVE
EACH OTHER,

03:30.381 --> 03:33.714
BECAUSE HIS HAND
IS IN YOUR BACK POCKET.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.286
JUST GRABBING SOME GUM.
OH.

03:35.286 --> 03:36.887
WHY DO YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE?

03:36.887 --> 03:39.219
(gasps) OH.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.553
IT'S BECAUSE YOU THINK
HE CAN'T TAKE IT.

03:42.553 --> 03:43.854
OH, IS THAT TRUE, BUDDY?

03:43.854 --> 03:46.897
UH... (sighs) HAPPY?

03:46.897 --> 03:47.898
MM-HMM.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.400
(chuckles)

03:49.400 --> 03:52.963
I AM COMING FOR YOU.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.966
HERE IS YOUR DOUBLE CHOCOLATE
FUDGE CAKE, CINDY.

03:55.966 --> 03:57.538
HAVE A GREAT PARTY.
(mouths word)

03:58.609 --> 04:00.271
THERE IS NO PARTY.

04:00.271 --> 04:02.413
SHE'S SINGLE,
AND IT'S FRIDAY.

04:02.413 --> 04:04.244
CINDY MAKES ME SAD.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.746
WHO CARES?
MY CAKE BUSINESS IS ON...

04:05.746 --> 04:06.877
(high-pitched voice) FIRE!

04:06.877 --> 04:08.419
I'M PICKING MY CLASSES
FOR NEXT SEMESTER.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.921
SHOULD I GO
WITH ALL PHOTOGRAPHY COURSES

04:10.921 --> 04:12.923
OR THROW IN A CLASS
IN SOME PROFESSION THAT

04:12.923 --> 04:14.585
ACTUALLY MAKES MONEY,
IN CASE I EVER WANT

04:14.585 --> 04:16.457
TO, YOU KNOW, EAT?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.659
DO YOU REMEMBER
MY LIFE PHILOSOPHY?

04:18.659 --> 04:20.831
DON'T GET HAMMERED
AT BRUNCH?
THE ONE AFTER THAT.

04:20.831 --> 04:22.533
YOU GOTTA SHAKE IT
TILL YOU MAKE IT?
IT TURNS OUT,

04:22.533 --> 04:25.035
THAT ONE IS ONLY REALLY GOOD
FOR DANCE-OFFS OR COCKTAILS.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.298
OKAY, NEW LIFE PHILOSOPHY--

04:27.298 --> 04:30.441
NOTHING EVER WORKS OUT
UNLESS YOU ARE IN...

04:30.441 --> 04:31.942
(deep voice) 100%.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.374
(cell phone alert chimes)

04:33.374 --> 04:35.806
(sighs) OH, MY GOD.
I'M LATE FOR MY REAL JOB.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.950
OKAY, EXCUSE ME!

04:39.950 --> 04:42.313
UHH!

04:42.313 --> 04:43.314
AAH!

04:46.957 --> 04:47.958
(purse thuds)

04:47.958 --> 04:49.320
(grunts)

04:49.320 --> 04:52.793
(panting)
WELL, GOOD-BYE TO YOU, SIR,

04:52.793 --> 04:53.964
AND THANK YOU FOR CALLING

04:53.964 --> 04:56.327
WITH YOUR VERY IMPORTANT
REAL ESTATE QUESTION.

04:56.327 --> 04:57.768
WHY ARE YOU SO WINDED?

04:57.768 --> 04:59.029
I WAS JUST PUTTING
ON MY LIPSTICK.

04:59.029 --> 05:00.471
I HAVE TO HOLD MY BREATH
TO DO IT.

05:00.471 --> 05:02.403
(inhales deeply) MM.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.704
THAT'S A PRETTY SHADE.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.337
IS THAT SO PEOPLE ON THE MOON
KNOW YOU'RE TACKY?

05:06.337 --> 05:07.838
UGH.

05:07.838 --> 05:09.309
UH, I JUST CAN'T WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND

05:09.309 --> 05:11.482
THIS WHOLE
"OUR MONEY" THING.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.984
THE DAY I FOUND OUT
ANDY AND I WERE SHARING MONEY,

05:13.984 --> 05:16.817
I QUIT MY JOB, GOT A BIG TV,
AND BOUGHT MYSELF

05:16.817 --> 05:19.450
TEN PAIRS OF SWEATPANTS.
NEVER LOOKED BACK.

05:19.450 --> 05:22.092
BUT YOU WEREN'T MARRIED
TO A FINANCIAL BLACK HOLE.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.524
I MEAN, IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO GET OUT OF DEBT,

05:23.524 --> 05:25.826
AND NOW I HAVE
A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.660
OH, BY THE WAYANS BROTHERS,
MY PAYCHECK BOUNCED.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.532
OH, WELL, JUST GIVE IT A WEEK.
IT'LL CLEAR. (chuckles)

05:31.532 --> 05:34.605
OR... YOU COULD
PAY HER NOW.

05:34.605 --> 05:35.966
WAIT.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.938
DID YOU JUST REALIZE SOMETHING
THAT I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED?

05:37.938 --> 05:40.511
OKAY, DON'T TELL ME!
UM, LEAD ME THERE.

05:40.511 --> 05:42.373
OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

05:42.373 --> 05:44.344
I HAVE
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.116
NO, THE ONE WE JUST
TALKED ABOUT.

05:46.116 --> 05:47.378
I CAN'T PAY LAURIE.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.480
SO NOW WHY ARE YOU MAD
AT GRAYSON?

05:49.480 --> 05:51.382
BECAUSE HE GAVE ME
THE U.T.I.

05:51.382 --> 05:52.483
NO!

05:52.483 --> 05:54.885
UH, BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO COMBINE FINANCES.

05:54.885 --> 05:57.388
YOU GOT IT! LET'S GO!

05:59.390 --> 06:00.691
OH, THIS IS EXCITING.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

06:00.691 --> 06:02.092
NO CLUE.

06:02.092 --> 06:05.135
SHH.

06:05.135 --> 06:06.497
(lowered voice)
ELLIE'S JUST JEALOUS.

06:06.497 --> 06:09.099
SHE THINKS I CARE ABOUT YOU
MORE THAN HER.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.441
DO YOU?

06:10.441 --> 06:11.872
YES. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.874
THAT'S WHY I NEVER MESS
WITH YOU.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.906
OH, THANKS, MAN.
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

06:17.047 --> 06:18.979
OOH, WHAT'S THAT?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.381
IT'S MY SELF-GENERATING
WATER BOTTLE.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.883
YOU JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE SUN,

06:22.883 --> 06:26.457
AND THE TINY MOTOR FUSES
OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN.

06:26.457 --> 06:30.661
IT BASICALLY PULLS WATER OUT
OF THE AIR AND FILLS ITSELF UP.

06:30.661 --> 06:31.662
YOU WANNA TRY IT OUT?

06:31.662 --> 06:34.024
COULD I?

06:34.024 --> 06:35.466
OOH, CHECK IT!

06:35.466 --> 06:38.499
ANDY LENT ME HIS
SELF-GENERATIN' WATER BOTTLE.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.433
FANTASTIC. AH.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.404
I DON'T FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THIS.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.607
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SEXIER.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.938
(whispers)
SHIRTS OFF TONIGHT.

06:47.938 --> 06:50.110
OH.
OH.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.613
(sighs)
WHY ARE YOU ROBBING ME?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.914
WELL, I OWE LAURIE MONEY
FOR WORK,

06:53.914 --> 06:56.086
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD PAY HER
WITH OUR MONEY.

06:56.086 --> 06:57.588
THANK YOU...
(chuckles)

06:57.588 --> 07:02.993
AND I... WOULD LIKE TO BUY
THIS BURGER.

07:02.993 --> 07:06.156
OH, MY GOD. NOW I UNDERSTAND
HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS.

07:06.156 --> 07:07.758
PROUD OF YOURSELF?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED

07:07.758 --> 07:09.600
TO POOL OUR MONEY...
(chuckles) SO--

07:09.600 --> 07:10.501
IN YOUR FACE!

07:10.501 --> 07:13.734
THUNDER STEALER.
(sighs) I WARNED YOU.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.606
NO, PLEASE DON'T.

07:15.606 --> 07:18.769
SO, ELLIE, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN A THUNDER STEALER?

07:18.769 --> 07:21.742
IT ALL STARTED ABOUT...
15 YEARS AGO.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.475
OH... (scoffs) BROTHER.

07:28.018 --> 07:29.019
OKAY. YOU KNOW, IT'S SMART
THAT YOU GUYS ARE TAKING

07:29.019 --> 07:30.781
A LOOK AT YOUR FINANCES.

07:30.781 --> 07:32.923
GRAYSON,
YOUR BAR IS BREAKING EVEN,

07:32.923 --> 07:34.855
BUT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING
ANY MONEY AWAY.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.887
NOPE. 4-DAY WORKWEEKS,
FREE DRINKS--

07:36.887 --> 07:39.560
LIVIN' THE DREAM.
WHAT'S UP?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.831
NO, THANKS. (chuckles)

07:40.831 --> 07:42.733
IT HAPPENED AGAIN,
DIDN'T IT?

07:42.733 --> 07:46.036
(sighs) WELL, I JUST SHOULDN'T
KEEP HONEY-ROASTED PEANUTS HERE.

07:46.036 --> 07:48.168
OKAY, PRESSING ON.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.871
JULES, YOU'RE DOING
ACTUALLY OKAY.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.042
THE RENT ON THIS PLACE
IS SO HIGH.

07:52.042 --> 07:54.044
DO YOU HAVE TO STAY
IN THE PLAZA?

07:54.044 --> 07:56.877
YEAH. MY BUSINESS IS ALL
ABOUT FOOT TRAFFIC.

07:56.877 --> 07:57.948
REALLY?

07:57.948 --> 07:59.079
NO, BUT IN THE AFTERNOON,

07:59.079 --> 08:01.181
WHEN THE SUN HITS MY DESK
JUST RIGHT,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.053
ALL MY NECK ISSUES DISAPPEAR.

08:03.053 --> 08:04.885
(clicks tongue and pops lips)

08:04.885 --> 08:06.817
THIS NEXT CUT IS A BIT PAINFUL,

08:06.817 --> 08:09.059
BUT ELLIE SAID I HAVE
TO TELL YOU.

08:09.059 --> 08:12.092
YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED
AN ASSISTANT.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.925
LAURIE, ANDY WANTS
TO FIRE YOU!

08:14.925 --> 08:16.827
SERIOUSLY, ANDY?!

08:16.827 --> 08:17.968
ELLIE SAID!

08:17.968 --> 08:19.530
I'M NOT SAYING WHEN,

08:19.530 --> 08:21.572
BUT YOU'RE GETTING A DEAD ARM.

08:21.572 --> 08:23.273
NOW I HAVE TO...
(cell phone alert chimes)

08:23.273 --> 08:25.976
GO DO SOME WORK THING.

08:25.976 --> 08:27.277
I DON'T WANT A DEAD ARM.

08:27.277 --> 08:28.739
LOOK, ALL THIS FINANCIAL STRESS

08:28.739 --> 08:31.081
DISAPPEARS ONCE YOU GUYS
GET MARRIED.

08:31.081 --> 08:33.113
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE GONNA SELL
ONE OF YOUR HOUSES

08:33.113 --> 08:34.785
AND LIVE TOGETHER.
LIVE TOGETHER?

08:34.785 --> 08:36.647
LIKE, ALL THE TIME
TOGETHER?

08:36.647 --> 08:39.850
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR FUTURE.
(cell phone alert chimes)

08:39.850 --> 08:41.151
I HAVE CAKE ORDERS
COMING IN,

08:41.151 --> 08:44.054
BUT I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO MY REAL JOB.

08:44.054 --> 08:45.796
UGH. I WISH THERE WAS MORE
THAN ONE OF ME,

08:45.796 --> 08:47.527
AND NOT JUST
FOR THE SEX STUFF.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.802
I WONDER IF ANY OF THESE RANDOS
WOULD WANT TO HELP ME OUT.

08:51.802 --> 08:53.103
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THERE IS
ONE THING PEOPLE LOVE...

08:53.103 --> 08:55.666
(sighs)
IT'S WORKING FOR FREE.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.708
I DON'T KNOW.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.110
HAPPY PEOPLE GET
THEIR COFFEE TO GO.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.112
(lowered voice) THE ONES
THAT ACTUALLY SIT DOWN

09:02.112 --> 09:04.174
ARE THE LOST SOULS.

09:04.174 --> 09:07.077
THEY'RE JUST WAITING,
TRYING TO GET UP ENOUGH COURAGE

09:07.077 --> 09:10.120
TO PULL A TAB OFF
THE "DRUMMER WANTED" SIGN.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.752
(normal voice) NO, DUDE.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.083
YOU'RE NOT WHAT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.055
(taps beats)

09:15.055 --> 09:18.158
I BET THEY'RE ALL JUST KINDA
DYING FOR SOMETHING TO DO.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.230
(scoffs) YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET HELP

09:20.230 --> 09:21.832
FROM A FAILED SCREENWRITER,
A FAILED SCREENWRITER,

09:21.832 --> 09:23.193
AND A FAILED SCREENWRITER?

09:23.193 --> 09:27.067
HEY, TOM. WOULD YOU GO
DELIVER THIS CAKE FOR ME?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.870
YOU WANT ME TO DROP EVERYTHING
AND DRIVE A CAKE ACROSS TOWN?

09:29.870 --> 09:30.871
I DO.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.202
I'M ON IT.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.345
BOOM!

09:40.751 --> 09:42.012
WATER!

09:44.314 --> 09:46.256
WE GOT WATER!

09:58.699 --> 10:00.330
NO WAY!

10:00.330 --> 10:03.203
WHOO! WATER!

10:03.203 --> 10:05.175
HOO-HOO-HOO!

10:06.877 --> 10:11.111
YOGI, HOW'S THAT SELF-GENERATING
WATER BOTTLE TREATING YA?

10:11.111 --> 10:14.214
IT'S AMAZING,
BUT THIS REGULATOR SUCKS.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.286
THIS THING FLOODED MY BOAT.

10:16.286 --> 10:19.319
THAT'LL HAPPEN.
TELL HIM WHY, ANDY.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.320
I DON'T WANNA.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.221
TELL HIM WHY.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.393
THE AMOUNT OF WATER
GENERATED DEPENDS

10:23.393 --> 10:25.756
ON THE HEAT-TO-WIND RATIO.
MM.

10:25.756 --> 10:28.228
DUH. I GET THE "WHYs" OF IT.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.761
I JUST WISH
IT HAD A BETTER REGULATOR.

10:30.761 --> 10:33.063
(laughing)

10:33.063 --> 10:35.005
DON'T YOU LAUGH AT HIM!

10:35.005 --> 10:38.739
DON'T YOU DO IT!
HE'S A BEAUTIFUL PERSON!

10:38.739 --> 10:40.671
SO, LOOK, JULES AND I ARE
HAVING A HARD TIME

10:40.671 --> 10:43.944
DECIDING WHICH HOUSE TO KEEP,
SO WE NEED YOUR HELP.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.376
JUST BE HONEST AND SPEAK
FROM YOUR HEART.

10:46.376 --> 10:47.878
I'LL ALWAYS LOVED
JULES'S HOUSE.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.019
MM.
SHUT UP, ANDY.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.020
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
WOW.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.051
YEAH.
HEY, GUYS.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.123
GIVE HIM A BREAK.
THIS IS REALLY HARD.

10:53.123 --> 10:56.056
WE BOTH HAVE STRONG
EMOTIONAL TIES TO OUR HOUSES.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.287
I MEAN, I RAISED
MY ONLY SON

10:57.287 --> 11:01.091
IN MY BEAUTIFUL
MEDITERRANEAN HOME,

11:01.091 --> 11:02.933
AND WHILE GRAYSON'S HOUSE
DOESN'T SEEM TO GET

11:02.933 --> 11:04.965
ANY NATURAL LIGHT,

11:04.965 --> 11:07.667
HE DID GO THROUGH
A NASTY DIVORCE HERE,

11:07.667 --> 11:10.400
WHICH LED
TO A YEARLONG SKANK PARADE.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.242
NOW I'M NOT TRYING
TO SWAY YOU EITHER WAY,

11:12.242 --> 11:13.774
BUT WHEN YOU GET UP
FROM THAT OTTOMAN,

11:13.774 --> 11:15.746
I'D GO GET
A PREGNANCY TEST.

11:15.746 --> 11:16.847
EW.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.849
IT IS A CUSHIONY PLATFORM
WITH WHEELS.

11:18.849 --> 11:21.081
IT WAS UTILIZED. (chuckles)

11:21.081 --> 11:22.212
(Andy and Bobby chuckle)

11:22.212 --> 11:24.384
WOULD YOU GUYS MIND
IF I MADE THIS ABOUT ME?

11:24.384 --> 11:26.116
WE'D BE SURPRISED
IF YOU DIDN'T.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.418
JULES'S HOUSE IS
RIGHT NEXT TO MINE.

11:28.418 --> 11:29.289
OURS.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.721
(chuckles)

11:30.721 --> 11:34.224
ANYWAY, GRAYSON'S HOUSE IS
AN EXTRA 30 STEPS...

11:34.224 --> 11:37.928
EVERY DAY... FOREVER.
CAN'T DO IT.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.069
I TOLD YOU TO COME UP

11:39.069 --> 11:41.331
WITH AN EMOTIONAL, HEARTFELT
REASON TO PICK MINE.

11:41.331 --> 11:44.134
YOU KNOW, I'M PARTIAL
TO THE LAYOUT OF THIS HOUSE.

11:44.134 --> 11:47.407
YOU KNOW, THE OPEN FLOOR PLAN
HAS A VERY LOGICAL FLOW.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.811
"LOGICAL FLOW"? HMM.
THAT'S HOW YOU TALK NOW?

11:50.811 --> 11:53.083
FINE. GRAYSON BRIBED ME
WITH BEER.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.084
(whispers) OH, GOD.
(clicks tongue)

11:54.084 --> 11:55.986
YOU AREN'T MAD,
ARE YOU, JULES?

11:55.986 --> 11:57.487
WELL, DOC,
I GUESS I'VE BEEN

11:57.487 --> 11:59.249
LETTIN' JULES DOWN
FOR YEARS.

11:59.249 --> 12:00.420
HE REALLY HAS.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.852
UH-HUH.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.454
HEY, STEVE,
DID THOSE EGGS MANAGE

12:04.454 --> 12:06.356
TO ORDER THEMSELVES?

12:06.356 --> 12:08.298
GET ON IT!

12:08.298 --> 12:10.200
IS THIS FOR REAL?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.302
AS REAL AS THE EASTER BUNNY,
EXCEPT REAL.

12:12.302 --> 12:14.164
(cell phone rings)
OH! IT'S SHOWTIME.

12:14.164 --> 12:16.206
HERE YOU GO, BETSY.

12:16.206 --> 12:17.437
KRAZY KAKES.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.339
HOLD FOR MS. KELLER.
(whispers indistinctly)

12:19.339 --> 12:22.472
(clears throat)
THIS IS LAURIE KELLER.

12:22.472 --> 12:25.175
SURE. DONE.

12:25.175 --> 12:26.476
(clatters)

12:26.476 --> 12:28.018
ATTENTION, STAFF.

12:28.018 --> 12:31.181
WE JUST SOLD...
OUR 20th CAKE TODAY!

12:31.181 --> 12:34.354
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUYS.
WOW.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.087
SO DRUNK ON POWER.
TRAV, GO FETCH ME A LATTE.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.088
NO.

12:38.088 --> 12:41.061
THANK YOU
FOR KEEPING ME GROUNDED.

12:41.061 --> 12:44.334
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
SHE'S NOT PAYING YOU.

12:44.334 --> 12:47.197
UH, WE'RE PART
OF SOMETHING HERE, MAN.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.402
I'M TAKING
THIS BAD BOY HIKIN'.

12:52.402 --> 12:53.944
BUT IT'S CRAZY HOT OUT.

12:53.944 --> 12:56.276
AND ALL YOU'RE TAKING
IS THAT EMPTY BOTTLE.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.278
AND THESE PRETZELS.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.409
THERE'S STILL A SIP IN THERE.

12:59.409 --> 13:02.512
THAT THING WORKS BEST
IF IT'S COMPLETELY EMPTY.

13:02.512 --> 13:03.353
ON IT.

13:04.454 --> 13:06.086
I HAVE TO TELL HIM.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.488
BUT IF YOU DO, IT'S LIKE
SAYING HE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.489
(door closes)

13:09.489 --> 13:12.392
DRY AS A BONE.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.395
YOU KNOW, I USED TO GET MAGIC
AND SCIENCE MIXED UP...

13:15.395 --> 13:17.968
(chuckles) BUT NOW I REALIZE
THEY'RE JUST ONE AND THE SAME.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.529
(laughs)

13:19.529 --> 13:21.431
(strained voice)
HAVE A GOOD HIKE.

13:21.431 --> 13:22.973
YOU BETCHA.

13:22.973 --> 13:24.174
(bag crackles)

13:24.174 --> 13:26.276
JULES, YOU HAVE
A SET SESSION EVERY WEEK.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.308
NO MORE SHOWING UP
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.541
IT'S OKAY. UH, BAXTER WILL
STILL BE DEAD TOMORROW.

13:31.541 --> 13:34.314
OH, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
YOUR DOG.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.315
BROTHER.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.416
NICE MEETING YOU.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.289
WE JUST NEED SOME HELP
WITH THIS HOUSE DECISION.

13:39.289 --> 13:42.022
YOU KNOW THE DRILL. (sighs)
LET ME HEAR YOUR "WHAT I WANTS."

13:42.022 --> 13:44.224
WHAT I WANT IS FOR HIM
TO STOP BEING UNREASONABLE.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.556
I WANT HER TO THINK
ABOUT MY NEEDS.

13:46.556 --> 13:48.598
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHERE
YOU GOT THIS LIP BALM.

13:48.598 --> 13:50.430
I WANT TO KNOW--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.162
JUST TRYING TO FILL
THE DAY.

13:52.162 --> 13:53.603
CAN WE GET BACK TO MY SESSION?

13:53.603 --> 13:56.506
THIS ISN'T YOUR SESSION.
THAT'S FOR ANOTHER SESSION.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.008
OKAY, I JUST DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA AGREE

13:58.008 --> 14:00.941
ON WHICH HOUSE TO SELL,
SO WHAT DO WE DO, FLIP A COIN?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.543
(pursed lips) DEAL. BY THE WAY,
THIS STUFF REALLY IS GREAT.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.046
ALL RIGHT.
HEADS--WE STAY AT MY PLACE.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.919
TAILS--WE LIVE
IN GRAYSON'S CRAP SHACK.

14:08.919 --> 14:10.520
(coin clinks)

14:10.520 --> 14:13.583
JULES, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE

14:13.583 --> 14:16.256
SUCH A BIG DECISION
ON A COIN FLIP.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.058
WELL, I-I WANT TO.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.230
THAT'S IT.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.132
I MAKE THE ALL THE COMPROMISES
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

14:22.132 --> 14:24.464
I EAT GLUTEN-FREE PASTA,
WHICH TASTES LIKE FARTS.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.466
I STOPPED WEARING
BLAZERS WITH HOODIES.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.138
(laughs)
(laughing)

14:28.138 --> 14:30.100
OH, MY GOD. I'M--I'M SORRY.
PFFT. (chuckles)

14:30.100 --> 14:31.902
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
IMPARTIAL, BUT COME ON.

14:31.902 --> 14:33.603
I'M KEEPING MY HOUSE.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.147
(pursed lips) FINE!

14:37.147 --> 14:38.478
(normal voice)
THEN I'M KEEPING MY HOUSE!

14:38.478 --> 14:41.481
SO... WHAT ARE WE DOING
WITH THE REST OF MY SESSION?

14:41.481 --> 14:42.612
THIS ISN'T YOUR SESSION.

14:42.612 --> 14:44.514
OH, WOULD YOU STOP IT?
(chuckles)

14:50.160 --> 14:51.321
HEY.

14:51.321 --> 14:52.622
HEY.

14:53.623 --> 14:55.926
YOU GONNA STAY
OVER THERE TONIGHT?

14:55.926 --> 14:57.267
IT IS SATURDAY.

14:57.267 --> 14:59.629
I MEAN, WE USED TO ALWAYS
STAY HERE ON THE WEEKENDS.

14:59.629 --> 15:01.171
I KNOW.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.334
I REALLY MISS THAT.

15:04.334 --> 15:08.008
YOU WERE THERE LAST NIGHT.
STOP BEING WEIRD. JUST TALK.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.409
DEAD ARM!

15:09.409 --> 15:12.382
OHH!
HE'S TOTALLY RIGHT,
YOU GUYS.

15:12.382 --> 15:13.583
(Andy groaning)

15:13.583 --> 15:15.685
YOUR HOUSE OR MINE?

15:15.685 --> 15:18.148
COME HERE.
WE'LL HAVE SEX FIRST.

15:22.492 --> 15:24.054
YOU HEADED IN?

15:24.054 --> 15:25.425
SURE AM.
OHH.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.358
IT'S BRUTAL. MAKE SURE
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WATER.

15:28.358 --> 15:30.060
I'VE GOT AN EXTRA BOTTLE
IF YOU WANT IT.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.601
I'M ALL SET.

15:31.601 --> 15:34.464
BUT... YOU... UM...

15:34.464 --> 15:36.166
(whistles)

15:37.367 --> 15:40.370
(chuckles) OKAY.

15:40.370 --> 15:44.244
I BOUGHT A DEMON MASK
SO I CAN GET REVENGE ON STAN.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.676
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD
WAIT TILL HE FALLS ASLEEP

15:46.676 --> 15:48.218
AND JUMP ON HIS BED

15:48.218 --> 15:49.679
OR JUST THROW HIM
OVER MY SHOULDER

15:49.679 --> 15:51.721
AND RUN OFF INTO THE WOODS
WITH HIM.

15:51.721 --> 15:53.253
HE'S YOUR CHILD.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.424
WELL, HE NEEDS TO LEARN.

15:54.424 --> 15:56.356
I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.387
HE'S HIKING
IN THE DEVIL'S HOLE.

15:57.387 --> 16:00.060
THAT'S, LIKE, 20 MILES
WITHOUT SHADE.

16:00.060 --> 16:03.433
YOU LET YOUR FRIEND HIKE
DEVIL'S HOLE WITHOUT ANY WATER?

16:03.433 --> 16:06.166
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
YOU CARED ABOUT HIM.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.398
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
HE'S FINE.

16:08.398 --> 16:09.669
DON'T YOU THINK HE'S FINE?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.671
(grunts in singsong voice)

16:11.671 --> 16:14.674
WHY WON'T YOU WORK?!

16:14.674 --> 16:17.977
(panting)
HA! WHEW. I'M BACK.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.049
I CAN'T DROP THIS OFF.

16:19.049 --> 16:20.510
THERE'S AN EMERGENCY
AT THE HOSPITAL.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.982
WELL, IT'S PRACTICALLY
ON YOUR WAY.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.983
I'M SORRY.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.515
OHH.
WELL, WITH THAT ATTITUDE,

16:25.515 --> 16:27.987
HE'S NEVER GONNA BE ANYTHING
MORE THAN A DELIVERY BOY.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.089
HE'S A NEUROSURGEON.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.262
MEH. I'LL JUST GET KAREN
TO DO IT. KAREN?

16:32.262 --> 16:35.725
WELL, WAIT. WHAT--
WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?

16:35.725 --> 16:39.169
TRAVIS! YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP THEM HERE.

16:39.169 --> 16:40.330
WHAT I AM SUPPOSED
TO THREATEN THEM WITH?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.501
"YOU'LL NEVER WORK

16:41.501 --> 16:44.434
IN THE VOLUNTEER CAKE-SELLING
BUSINESS AGAIN"? (chuckles)

16:44.434 --> 16:46.406
OH, THIS SUCKS.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.110
I FELT LIKE THIS WAS
BECOMING SOMETHING REAL.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.642
WELL, IT STILL CAN BE.

16:52.642 --> 16:54.314
LOOK AT ALL THESE ORDERS
YOU GOT.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.287
I MEAN, IF YOU REALLY WANT
THIS CAKE BUSINESS SO BADLY,

16:57.287 --> 16:59.089
WHY DON'T YOU ACTUALLY
GO FOR IT?

16:59.089 --> 17:01.491
WHAT, AND QUIT WORKING
FOR YOUR MOM?

17:01.491 --> 17:04.154
TRAVIS, I COULD NEVER LET
HER DOWN LIKE THAT.

17:04.154 --> 17:07.327
WELL, THEN YOU'RE BETRAYING
YOUR OWN LIFE'S PHILOSOPHY.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.658
NEVER FIGHT
SHORT-HAIRED BITCHES?

17:08.658 --> 17:10.630
WHAT?
I CHANGED IT AGAIN.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.463
SOMETHING WENT DOWN EARLIER
IN THE LADIES' ROOM.

17:13.463 --> 17:16.766
LAURIE, YOU SAID IT, OKAY?
NOTHING YOU REALLY WANT IN LIFE

17:16.766 --> 17:20.470
WORKS OUT
UNLESS YOU'RE IN 100%.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.612
I KNOW.

17:22.612 --> 17:24.144
(gasps) SHE'S BACK.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.475
(lowered voice) DON'T LOOK.
DON'T LOOK. DON'T LOOK.

17:25.475 --> 17:27.547
DON'T LOOK OVER THERE.
LOOK AWAY. UH-HUH.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.619
(pants) JULES,
IS--IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:29.619 --> 17:31.621
HEY, LYNN.
YOU WANT A GLASS OF WINE?

17:31.621 --> 17:32.622
YOU SAID IT WAS
AN EMERGENCY.

17:32.622 --> 17:34.684
YOU--YOU SAID
GRAYSON HIT YOU.

17:34.684 --> 17:36.526
NO. (chuckles)
I MEANT, HIT ON ME.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.628
(chuckles) I JUST WASN'T
FEELING SEXUAL,

17:38.628 --> 17:40.630
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S
A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE FOR ME.

17:40.630 --> 17:43.693
LOOKS LIKE YOU...
JUST HAD SEX.

17:43.693 --> 17:45.195
OH, WE DID. (chuckles)

17:45.195 --> 17:46.636
WELL, LOOK,
NOW YOU'RE HERE.

17:46.636 --> 17:48.438
LET'S JUST GET INTO IT.
(chuckles)

17:48.438 --> 17:49.599
THE HOUSE ISSUE.

17:49.599 --> 17:52.272
OKAY, I'M--I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS NOT OKAY WITH ME.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.643
I AM A PROFESSIONAL...

17:53.643 --> 17:56.206
(whiny voice)
AND THAT'S MY LIP BALM!

17:58.248 --> 18:01.551
I'M YOUR CRAZIEST PATIENT.
YOU CAN RETIRE OFF ME.

18:01.551 --> 18:03.513
YOU HAVE A POINT.
I DID JUST BUY A CATAMARAN...

18:03.513 --> 18:06.486
(chuckles) AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO SAIL.

18:06.486 --> 18:10.660
ALL RIGHT.
(sighs) WHAT DO YOU NEED?

18:10.660 --> 18:12.292
WE NEED A QUICK FIX.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.293
YOU WANT, LIKE, UH,
YOU WANT, LIKE,

18:13.293 --> 18:14.394
AN EASY-OUT KINDA THING,
RIGHT?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.526
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
UH, HOW ABOUT THIS?

18:16.526 --> 18:18.528
YOU GUYS AREN'T GETTING MARRIED
FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS.

18:18.528 --> 18:19.729
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN GET LUCKY

18:19.729 --> 18:21.501
AND IT COULD ALL FALL APART
BEFORE THEN,

18:21.501 --> 18:23.873
SO WHY SELL A HOUSE NOW,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:23.873 --> 18:25.405
TAKE ALL
THOSE HARD DECISIONS

18:25.405 --> 18:27.407
THAT, BY THE WAY,
EVERY COUPLE HAS TO MAKE

18:27.407 --> 18:30.210
AND JUST LET 'EM FESTER INSIDE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:30.210 --> 18:33.543
JUST--JUST PUT 'EM OFF UNTIL
THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT, HUH?

18:33.543 --> 18:35.515
OOH, LET'S DO THAT.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.516
YEAH.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.547
MM.

18:37.547 --> 18:38.548
I-I WAS BEING, UH--
MM.

18:38.548 --> 18:39.549
HMM.

18:39.549 --> 18:41.551
YOU'RE GOOD, LYNN...
MM.

18:41.551 --> 18:43.693
BUT IN THE SHORT TERM, WHAT DO
WE DO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS?

18:43.693 --> 18:44.854
(Joe Gil) в™Є I SPENT.. в™Є

18:44.854 --> 18:46.556
I KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO.
(sighs)

18:46.556 --> 18:48.598
в™Є IN YESTERDAY в™Є

18:48.598 --> 18:50.700
в™Є I GLANCED INSIDE в™Є

18:50.700 --> 18:53.303
LAURIE. (sighs)

18:53.303 --> 18:55.265
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

18:55.265 --> 18:58.568
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.

18:58.568 --> 19:02.712
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD
THE PARK RANGER CHECK ON BOBBY.

19:02.712 --> 19:04.574
HE'S LOST
IN THE DEVIL'S HOLE

19:04.574 --> 19:06.546
WITH A WATER BOTTLE
FULL OF LIES.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.448
SO HE GETS
A LITTLE THIRSTY.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.250
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT CAN HAPPEN?
(siren wailing in distance)

19:10.250 --> 19:12.522
THEY'RE
BRINGING HIM OUT NOW.

19:12.522 --> 19:13.553
BOBBY!

19:13.553 --> 19:14.654
(high-pitched voice) BOBBY!

19:14.654 --> 19:15.855
(gurney rattles)

19:15.855 --> 19:18.428
MAKE IT QUICK.
HE'S SEVERELY DEHYDRATED.

19:18.428 --> 19:22.592
(weakly) THAT'S JUST
A NORMAL WATER BOTTLE, ISN'T IT?

19:22.592 --> 19:23.663
YEAH.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.596
THEN THANKS FOR MESSIN'
WITH ME, BUDDY.

19:26.596 --> 19:28.568
ANYTIME.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.899
YOU MARRIED
TO ONE OF THOSE GUYS?

19:29.899 --> 19:31.701
NO, THEY'RE LOVERS.

19:31.701 --> 19:33.443
в™Є I PACKED... в™Є

19:33.443 --> 19:34.644
WANNA HAVE DINNER?

19:34.644 --> 19:35.875
NOPE.

19:35.875 --> 19:36.876
в™Є PAST в™Є

19:36.876 --> 19:38.708
WOW, THIS IS HARD.

19:38.708 --> 19:39.949
IT'S SO HARD.

19:39.949 --> 19:41.851
ALL THESE YEARS
YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR ME.

19:43.413 --> 19:45.485
I'M SO LUCKY
TO HAVE HAD THAT.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.757
BEFORE I MET YOU,
I HAD NOTHING.

19:47.757 --> 19:51.321
I WAS AS LOST AS SOMEONE
WHO HANGS OUT IN COFFEE SHOPS,

19:51.321 --> 19:52.662
BUT YOU HIRED ME,

19:52.662 --> 19:54.964
AND YOU TAUGHT ME HOW
TO BE RESPONSIBLE

19:54.964 --> 19:58.428
AND HOW TO TAKE CONTROL
OF MY LIFE.

19:58.428 --> 19:59.769
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

19:59.769 --> 20:00.970
YES, YOU DID.

20:00.970 --> 20:03.573
ALL RIGHT.
I DID, BUT YOU LISTENED.

20:03.573 --> 20:04.634
(sighs)

20:04.634 --> 20:05.635
COME HERE.

20:05.635 --> 20:06.636
MM. (sniffles)

20:06.636 --> 20:08.778
GO AHEAD. SAY IT.

20:08.778 --> 20:09.779
NO. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO THIS.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.611
I CAN'T DO IT. MNH-MNH.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.313
OKAY, LET'S SAY IT
AT THE SAME TIME.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.314
OKAY.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.915
GO! YOU'RE FIRED.

20:15.915 --> 20:16.916
I QUIT.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.488
в™Є NOTHING STAYS THE SAME в™Є

20:18.488 --> 20:21.451
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FIRED ME.

20:21.451 --> 20:23.893
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU QUIT.
BITCH.

20:25.955 --> 20:27.657
в™Є WE LIVED в™Є

20:27.657 --> 20:29.659
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE NOT GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

20:29.659 --> 20:31.561
I KNOW.

20:31.561 --> 20:32.662
HEY.

20:32.662 --> 20:35.635
ARE YOU STILL GONNA KEEP
THIS EXPENSIVE OFFICE?

20:35.635 --> 20:36.806
в™Є ...BACK в™Є

20:36.806 --> 20:41.771
в™Є WE LIVED OUR CHANCE в™Є

20:41.771 --> 20:45.475
HI. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
SOME BEACHFRONT CONDOS?

20:45.475 --> 20:46.976
NO, I JUST WANT CUPCAKES.

20:46.976 --> 20:49.349
в™Є I PACKED в™Є

20:49.349 --> 20:50.520
CRAP.

20:50.520 --> 20:55.725
в™Є OUR PAST в™Є

21:07.897 --> 21:10.570
RAWR!

21:10.570 --> 21:12.842
WHAT'S WRONG?

21:12.842 --> 21:15.675
MOMMY LOOKS WEIRD
WITHOUT HER MAKEUP.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.808
(laughs)

21:18.808 --> 21:20.650
ATTABOY, STAN.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.652
BEAT IT.
