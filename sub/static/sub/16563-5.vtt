WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:01.720
Previously on Pitch...

00:01.755 --> 00:04.281
Rhonda, I need you to book me
on the first flight to Amsterdam.

00:04.291 --> 00:05.759
None of the GMs can
know where I'm going.

00:05.892 --> 00:08.020
We were just wondering where Oscar is.

00:08.029 --> 00:10.929
Oh, it's an abscessed tooth.

00:10.964 --> 00:13.431
- That was a lie, right?
- Bold-faced.

00:13.467 --> 00:15.266
Maxine, I am never going
to go along with this.

00:15.302 --> 00:17.168
Well, we are gonna miss you around here.

00:17.204 --> 00:18.581
My kid wants a try out.

00:18.591 --> 00:20.079
Really? We're kind of in
the middle of something...

00:20.089 --> 00:21.258
Just let her throw a few.

00:21.268 --> 00:22.821
Let's go, I'm buying.

00:22.831 --> 00:24.778
I'm gonna call it early tonight, boys.

00:28.388 --> 00:29.580
I guess you could come.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.649
Well, since you're begging me, Tommy.

00:32.717 --> 00:35.316
- We need to be more careful.
- Relax.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.430
I'm not gonna say anything.
Although, I don't know why.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.890
- Ginny's a big girl.
- She's had your poster on her wall.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.486
_

00:43.521 --> 00:45.382
For the next two days,
guys in Major League

00:45.392 --> 00:47.724
front offices will be sweating
as much as the guys

00:47.759 --> 00:49.525
on the field.
Half the GMs are scrambling

00:49.561 --> 00:51.327
to find the missing pieces they need

00:51.396 --> 00:54.861
to make a playoff run while the
other half are holding fire sales

00:54.871 --> 00:57.361
hoping to restock their
pipelines with prospects.

00:57.371 --> 00:59.705
And they all have armies of guys

00:59.715 --> 01:01.341
who dream of being Jonah Hill.

01:01.351 --> 01:03.006
And not Wolf of Wall Street Jonah Hill,

01:03.041 --> 01:05.384
with the hookers,
the coke and the veneers,

01:05.394 --> 01:08.762
but Moneyball Jonah Hill,
with the algorithms and the donuts.

01:08.772 --> 01:10.772
- All right, gentlemen...
- Meanwhile, the players,

01:10.807 --> 01:12.673
- you know, the human beings
- we have 48 hours.

01:12.709 --> 01:14.175
Whose lives are turned upside
down when they're shipped

01:14.210 --> 01:15.571
from one city to another,

01:15.581 --> 01:18.112
try to focus on the only thing
they have control over,

01:18.148 --> 01:19.514
playing baseball.

01:19.549 --> 01:21.849
The Padres are down to their final out.

01:21.885 --> 01:24.986
Blip Sanders tying run
there at first base.

01:25.021 --> 01:26.954
The pitch. Lawson swings.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.190
He got all of it.
It's heading up the gap.

01:29.225 --> 01:30.591
Sanders rounds third.

01:30.627 --> 01:33.361
He comes in and scores.
The ball skips by

01:33.396 --> 01:34.862
the catcher's mitt, and Mike Lawson,

01:34.898 --> 01:36.130
they're gonna send him home!

01:36.166 --> 01:38.279
He slides head first!

01:38.289 --> 01:39.667
Safe!

01:39.702 --> 01:41.135
Six in a row.

01:41.171 --> 01:43.704
Oh, my. And Lawson

01:43.740 --> 01:46.340
is being mobbed at home plate.

01:46.376 --> 01:49.544
They're trying to resuscitate that dude.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.681
Remind me to hit it
over the fence next time.

01:53.716 --> 01:55.831
I'm getting too old for
inside the park home runs.

01:55.841 --> 01:57.785
Don't get carried away.
That was a double with two errors.

01:57.821 --> 01:58.820
Who died and made you official scorer?

01:58.855 --> 02:00.154
Hey, Baker,

02:00.190 --> 02:02.023
sorry I cost you a W.
As long as we get the win

02:02.058 --> 02:04.084
and runs are charged to you, not me.

02:04.094 --> 02:05.995
Catching on, grasshopper.

02:06.005 --> 02:08.128
You taught me well.

02:08.163 --> 02:09.530
Hey, Butch, what's with the bag?

02:09.566 --> 02:11.299
Did you hear something?

02:11.334 --> 02:13.903
Oh, no, but this
time of year got to be ready.

02:13.913 --> 02:16.571
I learned the hard way. You don't
want to end up in Kansas City

02:16.606 --> 02:19.574
with just floss and one pair of boxers.

02:19.609 --> 02:22.643
- You can disappear like that.
- Like the rapture.

02:22.679 --> 02:25.028
- Nothing left but your cleats.
- Baker, but you can relax.

02:25.038 --> 02:27.381
You're the biggest story in baseball,
you're not going anywhere.

02:27.417 --> 02:30.389
Relax says the man with no-trade clause.

02:30.399 --> 02:32.887
That's right, 'cause your ass
isn't going anywhere either.

02:32.922 --> 02:34.522
Well, tell that to Ken Rosenthal on MLB.

02:34.557 --> 02:35.857
Did Ken Rosenthal say something

02:35.892 --> 02:36.826
about you being traded?

02:36.836 --> 02:39.353
Blip was on a list with
like a hundred other players

02:39.363 --> 02:41.362
who the Cubs might be targeting.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.231
And that's all?

02:43.266 --> 02:44.999
- Yeah, it was nothing.
- I remember my first deadline.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.234
I couldn't sleep for a week.

02:46.269 --> 02:48.669
Oh, here we go. Grandpa story time.

02:48.705 --> 02:51.939
Somebody get him a pipe
and some ear hair.

02:51.975 --> 02:53.574
Oh, wait, hold on.

02:53.610 --> 02:55.774
No, all he needs is the pipe.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.069
That's funny.

02:57.079 --> 02:59.647
Well, now you don't get the story.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.547
- You want it now, don't you?
- Damn it, I do.

03:06.557 --> 03:09.783
Come on, give me the story, bro.
How do you do that?

03:09.793 --> 03:13.628
- Hey, Baker, you're not going anywhere.
- Yeah, but what about these guys?

03:20.184 --> 03:21.903
Hey, put your phones down.

03:21.938 --> 03:23.471
Phones down.

03:24.253 --> 03:26.040
That means you, too, Tommy Tough Nuts.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.643
Put your phone down. Look, if
one of you were getting traded

03:28.678 --> 03:31.712
you'd hear it from the GM, not Twitter.

03:31.748 --> 03:32.947
And I'm not gonna lie,
these next two days

03:32.982 --> 03:34.549
are gonna be rough, but guess what?

03:34.584 --> 03:36.384
We just won six in a row,

03:36.419 --> 03:38.986
and the Giants and the
Dodgers hear footsteps.

03:39.022 --> 03:40.621
So, I'm thinking,

03:40.657 --> 03:42.290
like it or not, I'm gonna be seeing

03:42.325 --> 03:45.293
all your ugly mugs right here tomorrow.

03:45.328 --> 03:48.462
Even you Javanes, with that
beautifully manicured goatee.

03:48.498 --> 03:49.730
How does he do that anyway?
Do you, like,

03:49.766 --> 03:51.732
groom between innings?

03:58.527 --> 04:01.073
Don't mind me, just passing through.

04:06.503 --> 04:09.073
I take that back. One of you is a goner.

04:17.293 --> 04:19.093
Great win today, Al.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.461
Those guys are gonna
give me a heart attack,

04:20.495 --> 04:21.862
- but they're getting it done.
- Yeah.

04:21.898 --> 04:24.365
So are we just on a lucky roll,
or is this team for real?

04:24.400 --> 04:25.633
Oh, could be.

04:25.668 --> 04:27.868
Need a few more pieces.

04:27.904 --> 04:30.805
- You okay?
- Yeah, just a toothache.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.807
Mm. I know our shopping list.

04:32.842 --> 04:34.562
Setup guy, utility infielder

04:34.572 --> 04:37.111
- and a corner man who can hit.
- Sounds about right.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.613
But tough to pull off.

04:38.648 --> 04:40.881
Al, look me in the eye.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.516
If I get you these players,

04:42.552 --> 04:44.395
are we in the playoff hunt?

04:47.657 --> 04:50.057
You have unusually long eyelashes.

04:50.679 --> 04:52.565
Uh, it's from my mother.

04:52.575 --> 04:53.613
Ah.

04:54.664 --> 04:56.497
You get me those players,
we're contenders.

04:56.532 --> 04:58.799
Does our new president
of baseball operations

04:58.835 --> 05:01.002
know about this sudden change of plans?

05:01.037 --> 05:03.576
I'm not sure he remembers my name.

05:03.586 --> 05:05.339
Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.

05:05.375 --> 05:06.574
No, get over here.

05:06.609 --> 05:08.309
Okay.

05:08.344 --> 05:10.144
- Hi. All right.
- Oh.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.646
Listen, the move from
Palo Alto's been a bitch.

05:11.681 --> 05:13.370
Sorry I haven't had a
chance to sit down.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.832
Do you have a minute now?

05:14.842 --> 05:16.183
Yeah.

05:16.219 --> 05:18.352
How come nobody told me how
much I was gonna love it here?

05:18.388 --> 05:21.522
I mean, running on the beach,
the Gaslamp District,

05:21.557 --> 05:24.258
Comic Con. I mean who doesn't
love cosplay, right?

05:24.293 --> 05:26.093
But let's face it,
you're not here to listen to me

05:26.129 --> 05:28.095
give you a San Diego booster speech.

05:28.131 --> 05:29.997
You got 44 hours to the trade deadline.

05:30.033 --> 05:31.365
You want to make some moves.

05:31.401 --> 05:33.734
And I'm thinking we need to be buyers.

05:33.744 --> 05:35.339
Ambitious. I like it.

05:35.349 --> 05:36.917
Do you think ownership
will be supportive?

05:36.927 --> 05:39.674
Maxine's given me carte blanche to do
whatever I think is best for the team,

05:39.709 --> 05:41.742
- That's great.
- Which is why

05:41.778 --> 05:43.567
during your shopping spree,
you cannot give up

05:43.577 --> 05:44.879
any of our top prospects.

05:44.914 --> 05:46.247
That includes Levine...

05:46.282 --> 05:47.644
- That's Livan.
- Livan.

05:47.654 --> 05:50.518
And the kid from Tennessee.
They're off the table.

05:50.553 --> 05:52.920
And you're gonna need to cut

05:52.955 --> 05:54.955
at least...

05:55.449 --> 05:57.758
$2 million from the payroll.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.866
No, those-those two mandates
are at cross purposes.

06:05.902 --> 06:07.902
I know.

06:07.937 --> 06:11.605
But it's like, you know when
people say, "Sky's the limit"?

06:11.641 --> 06:13.374
They're really limiting themselves.

06:13.409 --> 06:14.950
I mean, look at everything
you've done in your life.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.111
You grew up in the poorest
section of Mexico City.

06:17.146 --> 06:18.312
You made it to the major leagues.

06:18.347 --> 06:19.552
You retired.

06:19.562 --> 06:22.450
You became a scout,
and then you became a lawyer.

06:22.485 --> 06:24.719
And now, not only are you one of three

06:24.754 --> 06:28.138
Latino GMs in the league,
you're also the best dressed.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.324
Your whole life

06:30.359 --> 06:33.461
is a can-do story, Oscar.

06:33.496 --> 06:36.097
There is no limit to what you can do.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.600
Is there?

06:42.763 --> 06:44.405
There's still a chance.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.673
You can still win this,

06:45.708 --> 06:47.675
even though you're in
second place. Come on.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.343
- Spin her out.
- No.

06:49.378 --> 06:51.426
Oh, yeah.

06:54.150 --> 06:55.483
Verdict?

06:55.518 --> 06:57.985
Baby, this is your best risotto yet.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.653
Pfft. You say that every time.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.956
It's 'cause you keep
getting better and better.

07:01.991 --> 07:04.625
- And I keep getting more scared of you.
- Yo, hey!

07:04.660 --> 07:06.293
Dinner's almost ready!

07:06.329 --> 07:08.262
Oh, yeah!

07:08.297 --> 07:10.531
Chalk up another victory for Aunt Ginny.

07:13.504 --> 07:16.457
Wha... I mean, I-I got lucky.
You'll get me next time.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.506
You don't want me to start doing
the thing where I let you win, do you?

07:18.541 --> 07:19.774
- No.
- Yes.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.009
Psst.

07:22.044 --> 07:23.437
You know they're only seven right?

07:23.447 --> 07:26.313
- And a half.
- It's your turn to set the table.

07:26.659 --> 07:28.449
- Again?
- Oh, yeah! Yeah.

07:28.484 --> 07:29.683
Oh, yeah.

07:32.311 --> 07:34.121
- You're not gonna help?
- Help?

07:34.157 --> 07:35.823
I got you in here, didn't I?

07:41.264 --> 07:43.531
The house in San Elijo
just came back on the market.

07:43.566 --> 07:45.032
Mm, the one with the basketball court?

07:45.067 --> 07:46.300
- Yes.
- Wow.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.635
And the huge walk-in closets,

07:47.670 --> 07:49.170
three blocks from the twins' school.

07:49.205 --> 07:50.538
Look at that kitchen.

07:50.573 --> 07:52.226
- Look at that yard.
- Wow.

07:55.011 --> 07:57.411
The price dropped by 50 grand.

07:57.446 --> 07:58.879
Baby,

07:58.915 --> 08:01.148
I cannot think about
buying a new house right now,

08:01.184 --> 08:03.918
especially two days away
from the trade deadline.

08:03.953 --> 08:05.886
Is this about the FiveThirtyEight story?

08:05.922 --> 08:07.855
Wait, there's a story
about me in FiveThirtyEight?

08:07.890 --> 08:09.824
Babe, you have nothing to worry about.

08:09.859 --> 08:12.493
You're an all-star player
with a team-friendly contract.

08:12.528 --> 08:14.495
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

08:14.530 --> 08:18.232
I am a baseball player
without a no-trade clause.

08:18.267 --> 08:19.900
Nothing's written in stone.

08:21.204 --> 08:23.838
But, I mean, you can't move.

08:26.064 --> 08:28.364
You're the only real friends I have.

Hey, Gin, this is Jordan Collins,

09:02.745 --> 09:05.079
our new second baseman.
Just moved in from Charlotte.

09:05.114 --> 09:08.146
Why don't you take him
through the warmup drills?

09:09.952 --> 09:11.318
Um...

09:11.859 --> 09:14.955
First we're tossing, and then
after tossing, we do some running.

09:14.991 --> 09:16.423
And after running,

09:16.459 --> 09:18.125
you're probably gonna throw up.

09:19.495 --> 09:21.289
I know what you're gonna say.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.059
Heard it all before.

09:23.069 --> 09:25.966
You throw like a boy,
you run like a boy.

09:27.203 --> 09:29.436
I won't hold it against you.

09:33.048 --> 09:36.010
Whoa. Jordan Collins, you can throw.

09:36.045 --> 09:38.345
Never underestimate the
powers of the handicapped.

09:38.381 --> 09:40.314
Um, I didn't.

09:40.349 --> 09:42.182
You never seen In Living Color?

09:42.218 --> 09:44.285
- Can't say I have.
- You should see the show.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.153
Bring over my DVDs
someday after practice.

09:46.188 --> 09:47.755
Don't take this the wrong way,

09:47.790 --> 09:50.190
but I'm not about dating my teammates.

09:51.201 --> 09:55.529
Don't take this the wrong way,
but neither am I.

09:55.564 --> 09:57.064
How are you about making friends?

10:03.519 --> 10:05.209
I started off slow,

10:05.219 --> 10:07.641
but I found my rhythm.

10:07.677 --> 10:08.976
Finally got in the zone.

10:09.011 --> 10:10.344
Are you doing color?

10:10.379 --> 10:12.112
Post-game wrap. Ah.

10:12.148 --> 10:14.114
I was about to get to you. High marks.

10:14.150 --> 10:16.817
I'm honored.

10:16.886 --> 10:18.118
Leaving so soon?

10:18.154 --> 10:19.720
I can't sleep here.

10:19.755 --> 10:21.619
- Who said we were sleeping?
- I got to get back.

10:21.629 --> 10:24.768
I left my night guard at my place.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.126
Your night guard?

10:26.162 --> 10:28.443
If I don't sleep with it, I get
a sore jaw and a migraine.

10:30.390 --> 10:31.498
Night guard, huh?

10:31.534 --> 10:34.472
Well, that's a long way to go
for an excuse not to stay.

10:36.372 --> 10:37.905
Sorry.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.108
Was I supposed to get
all weak in the knees

10:40.118 --> 10:42.064
because you wanted me to stay?

10:44.250 --> 10:45.713
I'll walk you to your car.

10:52.188 --> 10:54.410
- What the hell?
- Oh, come on.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.690
- Not again.
- Again?

10:56.726 --> 10:58.592
- You know who did this?
- Man,

10:58.627 --> 11:01.371
I hate this groupie on groupie crime.

11:03.699 --> 11:05.399
Did you just call me a groupie?

11:05.434 --> 11:07.001
No. No.

11:07.036 --> 11:08.598
No, no. I meant groupie on you,

11:08.608 --> 11:11.038
an accomplished woman who's
clearly not a groupie, crime.

11:11.073 --> 11:12.406
It-It just came out...

11:12.441 --> 11:13.841
Don't hurt yourself.

11:13.876 --> 11:15.669
Come on, Amelia. Amelia?

11:15.679 --> 11:17.277
- Wow.
- Amel...

11:17.313 --> 11:18.846
Wha... I...

11:22.218 --> 11:25.252
Careful changing lanes
without your side mirrors.

11:27.157 --> 11:29.356
We just flipped Butch Hunter

11:29.392 --> 11:31.025
to the Cardinals

11:31.060 --> 11:32.726
for Omar Robles

11:32.762 --> 11:34.361
and a player to be named.

11:49.512 --> 11:50.728
Butch...

11:51.202 --> 11:52.780
Yes.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.434
One down,

11:56.444 --> 11:58.312
two to go.

11:59.492 --> 12:01.288
Congratulations on the Robles trade.

12:01.323 --> 12:02.823
Thank you.

12:02.858 --> 12:04.758
Payroll's still a little high.

12:04.794 --> 12:06.493
Yeah, I still have 39 hours.

12:07.089 --> 12:08.829
Eh, 38 hours and 51 minutes,

12:08.864 --> 12:10.825
but, uh, who's counting right?

12:10.835 --> 12:12.966
All right, have a good
night and remember...

12:14.476 --> 12:15.502
no limits.

12:15.538 --> 12:17.404
- No limits!
- All right.

12:18.066 --> 12:19.889
Except the budget.

12:24.982 --> 12:27.597
The two favorites have to
be Texas and the Dodgers.

12:27.607 --> 12:30.341
That was an absolute debacle.
And part of the reason

12:30.377 --> 12:32.817
that happened was because rumors,
right? People tweet about...

12:41.993 --> 12:43.621
- Hello?
- Hey, Eliot.

12:43.657 --> 12:45.544
You have a fantasy baseball team, right?

12:45.554 --> 12:47.225
The "Who's Your Papis."

12:47.260 --> 12:49.794
We're tied for third place right now,
but after this weekend...

12:49.830 --> 12:51.225
You don't actually care, do you?

12:51.235 --> 12:53.075
You have Blip on your team, right?

12:53.085 --> 12:55.967
And just so you know, I would've
drafted you, but my keeper

12:56.002 --> 12:57.535
- was a pitcher and...
- It's okay. It's okay.

12:57.571 --> 12:59.571
There are just a lot
of rumors out there,

12:59.606 --> 13:00.620
so I was just wondering:

13:00.630 --> 13:03.241
is there any way the
Padres would trade Blip?

13:03.276 --> 13:05.643
An All-Star center fielder

13:05.679 --> 13:07.812
with a multiyear, affordable contract?

13:07.848 --> 13:09.967
- Doubtful.
- But not impossible.

13:09.977 --> 13:13.084
I guess if the Padres could
get a cheap young guy

13:13.120 --> 13:14.552
in a position they need more,

13:14.588 --> 13:17.255
like... third base.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.757
Like Dom Cristiello.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.458
Wait, hold on.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.700
Okay, there's a rumor that
the Angels might be looking

13:23.710 --> 13:25.777
to trade Cristiello for a
catcher who can hit,

13:25.813 --> 13:27.779
like the Braves' Chase.

13:27.815 --> 13:30.015
But according to traderumors.com,

13:30.050 --> 13:31.458
the Braves aren't looking to rent.

13:31.468 --> 13:32.784
So, the only way Chase moves

13:32.820 --> 13:35.420
is if they were to get a young

13:35.456 --> 13:36.988
starting pitcher like Baltimore's

13:37.024 --> 13:39.090
Alfonso Guzman-Chavez.

13:39.126 --> 13:41.626
And the Orioles aren't looking
to part with their ace.

13:42.304 --> 13:43.862
I have no idea what you just said.

13:43.897 --> 13:45.753
Do I have to worry about Blip leaving?

13:45.763 --> 13:47.613
I'll make it easy for you.

13:47.623 --> 13:50.669
As long as Alfonso Guzman-Chavez
stays an Oriole,

13:50.704 --> 13:52.003
Blip stays a Padre.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.439
Alfonso Guzman-Chavez stays an Oriole.

13:54.988 --> 13:56.842
Great. Thanks.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.844
So, what pitchers do
you have on your team?

13:58.879 --> 14:00.712
Don't tell me you have Sonny and not me.

14:03.484 --> 14:05.717
His WHIP is really good.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.053
Hello?

14:10.996 --> 14:13.058
The guys on the team,
this has happened to me.

14:13.093 --> 14:15.827
You know, I played in Florida
for a long time and I...

14:16.294 --> 14:17.729
It's hot in here.

14:23.347 --> 14:26.204
Oh, then there's Pretty Woman.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.873
Hated it.

14:29.715 --> 14:31.309
This show's so wrong.

14:31.345 --> 14:32.677
That's why it's funny.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.045
It's getting late.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.982
Oh, my dad should be here any minute.

14:37.017 --> 14:38.850
Well, Ginny's got an
early morning bullpen,

14:38.886 --> 14:40.897
so she needs to go to bed soon.

14:40.907 --> 14:43.170
Why don't I take you home, son?

14:43.180 --> 14:45.056
I mean, he's...
He's probably on his way.

14:48.703 --> 14:50.595
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker.

14:51.816 --> 14:54.499
Your father's a busy man. Working,

14:54.535 --> 14:56.777
raising you all by himself. I get it.

14:56.874 --> 14:58.486
Yeah, he is.

15:00.037 --> 15:04.042
Still, I hope he can come
see one of your games.

15:04.743 --> 15:06.294
You've been raking.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.883
He's not as big a
baseball fan as you are.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.549
Looks like this is my stop.

15:39.082 --> 15:40.345
Jordo.

15:48.126 --> 15:49.536
Thanks.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.763
Everything okay, Dad?

16:00.500 --> 16:02.000
Everything's fine.

16:10.194 --> 16:12.510
No, thank you. Call me when
you're ready to talk Barnes.

16:12.546 --> 16:13.834
Here you go.

16:14.336 --> 16:15.947
- What's that?
- You're going to the dentist.

16:15.983 --> 16:18.283
- No, I'm not.
- You have an abscessed tooth.

16:18.318 --> 16:19.951
Yeah, thanks to you. You jinxed me.

16:19.987 --> 16:21.519
It's not going away on its own and

16:21.555 --> 16:23.121
Dr. Gerard can see you now.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.190
He said it won't take long.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.459
Okay,

16:27.494 --> 16:28.960
but I need an analytics guy
to come with him.

16:28.996 --> 16:30.195
Grab Ross.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.997
First name Ross or last name Ross?

16:34.421 --> 16:36.033
You know the one I like.

16:40.223 --> 16:41.439
Your car's here.

16:41.449 --> 16:44.849
- Oh, my car's in the shop.
- This was left here for you.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.531
Oh, what a surprise.

17:07.567 --> 17:08.800
You got me a car?

17:08.835 --> 17:11.202
It's a loaner.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.238
I'm part owner of a dealership,
so we get 'em for free,

17:13.272 --> 17:15.373
but I made sure that yours
was completely loaded.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.742
Shaker HD radio, cross-traffic alert.

17:17.778 --> 17:20.211
- Mm.
- It's the least I could do.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.513
Just a little tip from a professional.

17:22.549 --> 17:25.849
Don't apologize for calling me a
groupie by treating me like one.

17:25.886 --> 17:28.753
I was making sure that you
had something to drive

17:28.789 --> 17:30.689
while your car was in the shop.

17:30.724 --> 17:32.757
Unlike most of the women
that you sleep with,

17:32.793 --> 17:35.927
I'm solvent and old enough
to rent my own car.

17:39.299 --> 17:41.215
You could just say thank you.

17:46.073 --> 17:48.840
Sir, I-I just want to say
what an honor it is to be here.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.042
W-Who's next on the list
of possible relievers?

17:51.078 --> 17:52.911
Uh, uh, uh, Gordon from Seattle.

17:52.946 --> 17:56.114
- All right, get me Fishman in Seattle.
- Okay.

17:56.149 --> 17:57.813
Do you have the number?

18:00.627 --> 18:02.687
Yeah, I had my wisdom
teeth out last year.

18:02.723 --> 18:04.122
It-it really wasn't that bad.

18:04.157 --> 18:06.524
I, uh... I used tea bags to
keep down the swelling.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.660
Did you go to MIT or Cal Tech?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.795
Uh, Camarillo Junior College.

18:10.831 --> 18:12.230
My dad's friends with Maxine.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.889
Is your first name Ross?

18:15.653 --> 18:18.269
Oh, you wanted Jake Ross, didn't you?

18:18.757 --> 18:20.551
Oscar, what can I do for you?

18:20.561 --> 18:22.741
Word is you're looking for a DH.

18:22.776 --> 18:26.311
I have a first baseman with
a .479 slugging percentage.

18:26.346 --> 18:28.046
Han for Gordon, what do you think?

18:28.081 --> 18:30.081
Who are you gonna put on first?

18:30.117 --> 18:31.716
We're moving Weidner from third.

18:31.752 --> 18:33.318
- Then who's playing third?
- Not your worry.

18:33.353 --> 18:35.153
Come on. Let's trade our players,

18:35.188 --> 18:37.555
and their contracts,
and get on with our lives.

18:37.591 --> 18:39.390
Fine, Gordon's yours.

18:40.021 --> 18:42.260
All right. Han's on the
first plane to Seattle.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.395
Yes!

18:44.431 --> 18:49.100
All right. We have a reliever and we
trimmed $2 million off the payroll.

18:49.136 --> 18:51.903
So who's gonna play
third for us tonight?

18:53.774 --> 18:55.140
You know, don't take this the wrong way,

18:55.175 --> 18:56.741
but you're a bit of a killjoy, Ross.

19:02.657 --> 19:04.458
Let me know if your guy
hears anything else about

19:04.494 --> 19:06.121
when and if those pictures
are gonna to drop.

19:06.131 --> 19:09.254
- Still quiet, so far.
- Let's hope it stays that way.

19:09.264 --> 19:13.024
I also need you to return this
to Lawson Auto Gallery.

19:13.394 --> 19:16.767
- Uh, the one in Carlsbad?
- Whichever one's closest.

19:17.075 --> 19:18.274
Okay.

19:20.683 --> 19:22.312
You can stop playing dumb.

19:22.348 --> 19:24.147
I know that you know about me and Mike.

19:27.130 --> 19:30.220
Okay? You didn't know about me and Mike?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.722
Okay. I mean, not that there's

19:31.757 --> 19:33.457
really anything to know,
but thanks to some

19:33.492 --> 19:36.660
D-level groupie who took out
her frustration on my car

19:36.695 --> 19:38.990
and Mike's absurd attempts
to make amends,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.419
I need you to take this car
back to the dealership ASAP.

19:46.171 --> 19:49.840
Okay, the groupie was probably
more of like an A-level groupie.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.642
Yeah. You know, Mike may be a womanizer,

19:51.677 --> 19:53.176
but he has good taste.

19:53.212 --> 19:54.645
Obviously.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.813
And we're two consenting adults.

19:56.849 --> 19:58.915
It's been a lonely
couple of years and...

19:58.951 --> 20:00.584
he makes me laugh.

20:00.619 --> 20:02.819
I mean, I really don't
see what the problem is

20:02.855 --> 20:05.422
or frankly, why this is
any of your business.

20:05.457 --> 20:07.190
I don't know.

20:10.129 --> 20:13.651
Of course, you cannot breathe a
word about this to anybody,

20:13.661 --> 20:15.238
especially Ginny.

20:20.388 --> 20:23.533
_

20:26.811 --> 20:28.445
Hey, like a lot of you, uh,

20:28.480 --> 20:29.813
I'm gonna miss Butch,

20:29.848 --> 20:31.615
and, uh, not 'cause with him gone

20:31.650 --> 20:33.717
I'm now the oldest one on the team.

20:33.752 --> 20:35.652
But, uh...

20:35.688 --> 20:37.487
happy travels, Butch.

20:37.523 --> 20:38.989
Hey, Tommy, you're gonna have
to find somebody else

20:39.024 --> 20:40.791
to beat at MLB 16.

20:40.826 --> 20:42.689
All right, listen up.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.162
I want you to all welcome Omar Robles.

20:45.197 --> 20:46.589
And, uh,

20:46.599 --> 20:48.131
I don't know if you've all heard,

20:48.167 --> 20:51.234
but, uh, Butch Hunter's been traded.

20:51.270 --> 20:54.037
- Yeah, we noticed.
- No, I mean he's been traded again.

20:54.073 --> 20:55.906
St. Louis sent him to Chicago.

20:55.941 --> 20:59.042
I wish I had that guy's
frequent flyer miles.

20:59.078 --> 21:00.577
You bring your third base glove?

21:00.612 --> 21:02.824
No, sir. I never played third before.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.548
Hope you're a fast learner.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.483
Over here.

21:08.887 --> 21:13.137
How 'bout we take some, uh, quality
time away from all these trade rumors.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.660
What were you thinking?

21:36.153 --> 21:38.515
I'm gonna miss that S.O.B.

21:39.643 --> 21:43.282
Yeah. No one belts Blake
Shelton songs like Butch.

21:48.994 --> 21:51.061
You know, the worst part...

21:51.526 --> 21:53.964
is our kids are like best friends.

21:58.041 --> 22:01.705
Hey. To NC State's new pitching phenom.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.273
It's not that big a deal.

22:03.308 --> 22:04.875
You got yourself a free ride

22:04.910 --> 22:07.144
to college. That's a big deal.

22:07.179 --> 22:08.645
I just wish you were coming.

22:09.565 --> 22:11.141
Ah. It is what it is.

22:11.151 --> 22:12.716
My dad doesn't have the money and...

22:12.751 --> 22:14.618
I don't have your arm.

22:14.653 --> 22:16.887
You just have to promise, while
you're leading the wolf pack

22:16.922 --> 22:20.090
to the College World Series,
you won't forget about me.

22:20.125 --> 22:22.092
That's not gonna happen.

22:22.127 --> 22:23.760
I moved around.

22:23.796 --> 22:25.729
I know how these things go.

22:26.482 --> 22:27.764
No...

22:28.101 --> 22:30.834
I meant the wolf pack isn't
making the College World Series.

22:30.869 --> 22:33.236
I'm definitely gonna forget you.

22:35.841 --> 22:37.607
Definitely.

22:40.479 --> 22:42.512
There he is. What's up, big man?

22:42.548 --> 22:44.681
Ginny, this is my wife Tessa... Hi.

22:44.716 --> 22:46.349
And this is Jimmy.

22:46.385 --> 22:48.185
Go on, say hi.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.086
Sorry, excuse me.

22:50.122 --> 22:53.123
There's a rumor that
Cleveland's asking about Blip.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.142
_

22:59.415 --> 23:01.318
Well, somehow the Padres

23:01.328 --> 23:03.637
pulled it out.
That's eight wins in a row.

23:03.647 --> 23:07.191
Still the question remains,
Dick, what does Oscar Arguella

23:07.226 --> 23:08.993
- intend to do about third base?
- What do we have on Grayson?

23:09.028 --> 23:10.025
White Sox third baseman?

23:10.035 --> 23:11.347
Who else would I be asking about?

23:11.357 --> 23:13.364
This is why my dad didn't
hire me at his firm.

23:13.399 --> 23:14.832
He said I asked
too many stupid questions.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.167
- Grayson stats.
- I'm sorry.

23:16.202 --> 23:18.836
Uh... Yeah, yeah.
Grayson's good with the glove,

23:18.871 --> 23:20.871
but his offensive WAR
is negative two and...

23:20.907 --> 23:23.374
that's MIT Ross's number.

23:26.718 --> 23:29.217
All right, it's Dom Cristiello or bust.

23:29.227 --> 23:31.961
- He's a good corner man.
- Problem is, Angels won't deal with me.

23:31.997 --> 23:33.897
Payback for signing Livan Duarte.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.434
I still can't believe Evelyn
threw me out for the night.

23:37.469 --> 23:40.370
Hovering over your computer,
refreshing FoxSports.com

23:40.405 --> 23:41.604
every five minutes, that'll do it.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.306
I'm trying to block out the noise,

23:43.341 --> 23:45.742
but we both know with that
new guy in the front office,

23:45.777 --> 23:46.876
anything is possible.

23:46.912 --> 23:49.279
Yeah. Can't trust a guy
who bikes to work.

23:54.121 --> 23:55.785
Oh no, come on. Don't let me cramp

23:55.821 --> 23:57.086
- your style.
- No, man. It's not you.

23:57.122 --> 23:58.692
It's... just not in the mood.

23:59.538 --> 24:00.623
What's her name?

24:00.659 --> 24:02.492
- What are you talking about?
- You wouldn't pass up

24:02.527 --> 24:05.228
available talent if there
wasn't a reason that had

24:05.518 --> 24:07.518
a name and a few curves.

24:08.333 --> 24:10.400
Cleveland's not that bad.
I mean who knows,

24:10.435 --> 24:12.569
You might start
palling around with LeBron.

24:14.112 --> 24:16.172
Huh. If it's a secret,

24:17.215 --> 24:18.843
that must mean it's
somebody of consequence.

24:18.853 --> 24:20.910
- Beer?
- If it's a secret from me, then that

24:20.946 --> 24:25.245
must mean the consequence
is close to home.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.151
Okay, so I know it's not Ginny,
'cause even you're not

24:28.186 --> 24:29.786
that crazy.

24:30.378 --> 24:33.156
But if the consequence
is Ginny-adjacent...

24:35.054 --> 24:36.917
- Her agent?
- You know what's fun?

24:36.927 --> 24:39.138
The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
You should check that out, too,

24:39.148 --> 24:40.497
- while you're there.
- Wait, hold on.

24:40.532 --> 24:42.131
You can keep talking about
Cleveland all you want.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.534
That's not gonna change
the fact that you're sleeping

24:44.569 --> 24:46.135
with Ginny's agent.

24:50.826 --> 24:52.141
You happy, Sherlock?

24:52.177 --> 24:53.309
Have you told Ginny?

24:53.345 --> 24:54.377
No, it's none of her business.

24:54.412 --> 24:56.646
Amelia and I are both single...

24:56.681 --> 24:58.311
over 18. Not a big deal. Come on.

24:58.321 --> 25:01.792
- Well, then why haven't you told Ginny?
- I don't know.

25:01.802 --> 25:03.781
So what am I supposed to do now?

25:03.791 --> 25:05.942
I can't keep secrets from Evelyn.

25:05.952 --> 25:08.870
And you know Evelyn can't
keep a secret from Ginny.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.164
She can't even keep a secret, period.

25:11.174 --> 25:12.707
I didn't want to talk about it.

25:12.742 --> 25:14.709
Remember I kept changing the subject?

25:14.744 --> 25:16.911
Listen.

25:16.947 --> 25:18.913
Whatever it is

25:18.949 --> 25:21.215
that you and Amelia are doing,

25:21.251 --> 25:24.009
you got to tell Ginny, bro.

25:24.019 --> 25:26.321
Because you know it's gonna get out.

25:26.356 --> 25:28.656
And it'd be a lot better for everybody

25:28.692 --> 25:30.291
if she hears it from you.

25:32.176 --> 25:35.096
You want to make sure
you twist it very tight.

25:35.131 --> 25:37.065
Thanks for letting me hang here tonight.

25:37.100 --> 25:40.501
Of course. You know
you're one of the family.

25:40.537 --> 25:42.337
I don't know why I'm so worried.

25:42.372 --> 25:44.472
The Padres without Blip is like...

25:45.075 --> 25:46.841
Destiny's Child without Beyoncé.

25:47.131 --> 25:49.677
Mm. I love my husband,

25:49.713 --> 25:51.016
but he's no Queen B.

25:51.026 --> 25:53.081
I mean... Kelly Rowland maybe?

25:53.116 --> 25:54.515
Okay, but you get my point.

25:54.551 --> 25:57.018
Look, even if... God forbid...

25:57.053 --> 25:58.915
Blip is traded,
we'd still see each other.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.276
I know you mean that, but things happen.

26:03.293 --> 26:06.794
Oh, well... look who's home,
my very own Bey.

26:10.597 --> 26:12.359
Not you, honey. Alfonso...

26:12.369 --> 26:15.169
Guzman-Chavez. The Orioles
traded him to the Braves.

26:21.895 --> 26:23.433
- What's the problem?
- Okay, so, there's

26:23.443 --> 26:26.991
a chance the Padres could trade you,
but it doesn't mean they will, right?

26:27.001 --> 26:28.433
Right?

26:28.443 --> 26:30.328
Oscar hasn't said anything
to you, has he?

26:30.338 --> 26:32.887
- No.
- What's going on?

26:32.922 --> 26:35.597
What does Alfonso Guzman-Chavez
have to do with this?

26:35.607 --> 26:37.668
We're fine. Okay? We're good.

26:37.678 --> 26:39.527
And you haven't heard
anything from your agent.

26:39.562 --> 26:41.455
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

26:41.465 --> 26:42.865
I mean, just because it could
happen doesn't mean it will...

26:42.875 --> 26:46.634
Ginny! This isn't your life. It's mine.

26:46.669 --> 26:48.994
Now any minute now I might
have to wake my boys up

26:49.004 --> 26:50.972
and tell them that we're saying good-bye

26:51.007 --> 26:53.185
to the only home they've ever known.

26:53.195 --> 26:57.011
I just don't have it in me
to make you feel okay.

27:03.553 --> 27:05.486
You should probably go.

27:05.496 --> 27:07.088
Yeah.

27:11.655 --> 27:13.661
I'm sorry, Ev.

27:17.372 --> 27:20.773
_

27:33.683 --> 27:37.451
Hey, Gin. I want to show you
a couple of these mockups.

27:39.622 --> 27:41.556
Everything okay?

27:41.591 --> 27:43.991
I think the Padres might trade Blip.

27:44.984 --> 27:47.469
- He's good.
- Yeah, he is. He's really good.

27:47.479 --> 27:49.197
That's why they might deal him.

27:49.443 --> 27:51.132
They could get a lot for him.

27:51.167 --> 27:53.761
Not if you tell them
you don't want them to.

27:54.771 --> 27:56.437
That's not exactly how it works.

27:56.472 --> 27:58.439
Actually it is. I used to see this

27:58.474 --> 28:00.641
with my actresses all the time.

28:03.179 --> 28:05.847
You can't be scared
to ask for what you want.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.013
You know why Clooney got to direct?

28:09.419 --> 28:10.952
'Cause he asked.

28:10.987 --> 28:12.687
- So you think I should...
- Right now...

28:12.722 --> 28:15.845
And this is no disrespect
to your teammates...

28:16.180 --> 28:17.845
You are the Padres.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.019
I know how much Blip
and Evelyn mean to you,

28:20.029 --> 28:22.763
and if he makes your life
better, makes the team better,

28:22.799 --> 28:25.666
you don't just ask for what
you want. You demand it.

28:25.702 --> 28:28.699
And they'll respect you
all the more for doing so.

28:30.006 --> 28:33.143
- Should we, uh, try the Angels GM again?
- You know, Ross, making a deal

28:33.153 --> 28:35.576
is like dating. You don't
want to seem too desperate.

28:35.586 --> 28:37.044
Well, for what it's worth,
my best move is

28:37.080 --> 28:38.679
to call the girl over and over again

28:38.715 --> 28:40.681
until she finally agrees
to have dinner with me... Uh-oh.

28:40.717 --> 28:41.949
- How you doing boys?
- Good.

28:42.434 --> 28:43.517
Hey, did you, uh...

28:43.553 --> 28:45.887
- find me a third baseman yet?
- Uh, no, not yet. Turns out,

28:45.922 --> 28:48.122
there is a limit of
available players at that spot.

28:48.157 --> 28:49.891
So, uh, we're working on it.

28:49.926 --> 28:51.792
- Ticktock, Clarice.
- Yeah.

28:51.828 --> 28:53.697
Call the Angels.

28:53.707 --> 28:55.371
You're persistent.
I'll give you that, Oscar.

28:55.381 --> 28:57.962
Come on. What's it going to take
for me to get Dom Cristiello?

28:57.972 --> 28:59.667
I'll make it quick.
Give me Livan Duarte,

28:59.702 --> 29:00.957
you get my third baseman.

29:00.967 --> 29:03.137
- You know I can't do that.
- See? Quick.

29:06.251 --> 29:08.057
You know, my buddy
in Chicago says the Angels

29:08.067 --> 29:09.543
are also talking to the Cubs.

29:09.579 --> 29:10.878
The Cubs don't need a third basemen.

29:10.914 --> 29:12.313
They need a setup guy.

29:12.763 --> 29:14.488
So, what's holding up the deal?
What do the Angels need

29:14.498 --> 29:15.997
that the Cubs won't give up?

29:16.007 --> 29:19.253
Oscar, I'm sorry to
bother you. She says it's urgent.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.052
- Hi.
- Sorry,

29:22.062 --> 29:23.824
I know it's a crazy day for you guys.

29:23.834 --> 29:26.494
- Yeah, just a little.
- It won't take longer than a minute.

29:32.722 --> 29:33.768
I know this might be out of line,

29:33.803 --> 29:34.792
- but I need to.
- Ginny.

29:34.802 --> 29:36.437
- I need...
- Ginny.

29:36.472 --> 29:38.272
I can't say that we wouldn't trade you.

29:38.308 --> 29:40.708
I can't say that to a player
unless they have no-trade,

29:40.743 --> 29:42.076
which you don't.

29:42.111 --> 29:44.946
But if I trade you now,
they'd send me packing with you.

29:44.981 --> 29:47.148
I'm-I'm not coming about me.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.354
With all the butts I put in the seats,

29:53.389 --> 29:55.122
with all the Ginny Baker
jerseys you sell.

29:55.158 --> 29:56.624
- Wow.
- I'm never gonna have more leverage

29:56.659 --> 29:58.712
than I do right now, so...

29:58.722 --> 30:01.160
Blip Sanders needs to stay on this team.

30:01.345 --> 30:03.531
Every time I step on the mound,
I know he's got my back.

30:03.566 --> 30:06.293
Ginny... I-I cannot
discuss roster with you.

30:06.303 --> 30:08.154
Okay, what about his family?

30:09.105 --> 30:10.805
His family?

30:10.840 --> 30:13.574
His seven-year-old twins whose
lives will be turned upside down

30:13.609 --> 30:15.977
without warning...

30:21.784 --> 30:23.675
Blip's a baseball player.

30:23.685 --> 30:26.320
We pay boatloads of money

30:26.356 --> 30:29.991
to baseball players to
essentially play a kid's game.

30:30.026 --> 30:33.327
And in exchange, we get the power

30:33.363 --> 30:35.629
to uproot them and their families

30:35.665 --> 30:37.565
so they can play a kid's game

30:37.600 --> 30:40.167
for boatloads of money somewhere else.

30:40.203 --> 30:43.944
And after a few years,
thanks to collective bargaining,

30:43.954 --> 30:45.406
they can become free agents.

30:45.441 --> 30:48.109
And then they can decide
to uproot their families

30:48.144 --> 30:51.445
for boatloads of money themselves.

30:51.481 --> 30:53.114
That's how it works.

30:53.149 --> 30:54.482
- But the fans...
- Oh, you're gonna tell me

30:54.517 --> 30:56.517
what the fans want?
I know what they want.

30:56.552 --> 30:58.819
Same thing as the owners.
They want to win.

30:58.855 --> 31:02.002
Same as your teammates.
Because they would trade you,

31:02.012 --> 31:04.759
and their best friend
if it meant a ring for them.

31:04.794 --> 31:06.594
That's how this works.

31:09.848 --> 31:12.099
- Thank you for your time.
- Uh-huh.

31:12.135 --> 31:14.268
Hey, Ginny. You're right.

31:14.303 --> 31:15.803
Out of line.

31:30.086 --> 31:32.443
- Rhonda.
- Yes?

31:32.453 --> 31:33.954
Give me the Cubs
front office on the phone

31:33.990 --> 31:35.523
and get Ross back in here and tell him

31:35.558 --> 31:37.625
I know what the Angels need.

31:38.317 --> 31:39.326
A center fielder.

31:39.362 --> 31:41.395
You're not thinking about
trading Blip, are you?

31:53.443 --> 31:54.875
♪ You and I ♪

31:54.911 --> 31:57.845

32:04.620 --> 32:06.520
Dad, that's our pump-up song.

32:06.556 --> 32:08.055
You're all pumped up enough.

32:11.127 --> 32:12.893
Sorry, I was... I'm really excited!

32:12.929 --> 32:14.328
It's a big game.

32:14.363 --> 32:16.762
- Is your dad really coming?
- He really is.

32:16.772 --> 32:18.399
He swore on a stack of Racing Forms.

32:18.434 --> 32:20.935
That's his bible.

32:52.068 --> 32:54.468
This is the Collins residence.
You know what to do.

32:55.750 --> 32:59.106
Hey, Ray, it's, uh, Bill, Ginny's dad.

32:59.142 --> 33:00.641
I'm here at the game,

33:00.676 --> 33:02.543
watching your son play his heart out.

33:04.113 --> 33:06.615
I know you're a busy man, but...

33:07.250 --> 33:08.782
it would mean the world to your kid

33:08.818 --> 33:10.084
if you could be here.

33:51.994 --> 33:54.684
Hey, Ray, it's, uh, Bill, Ginny's dad.

33:55.353 --> 33:56.992
I'm here at the game,

33:57.002 --> 33:59.466
watching your son play his heart out.

34:00.636 --> 34:03.037
I know you're a busy man, but...

34:03.072 --> 34:05.172
it would mean the world to your kid

34:05.208 --> 34:07.274
if you could be here.

34:19.021 --> 34:21.054
You have one new message.

34:21.090 --> 34:24.190
Dad, I'm here at the
field. Are you coming or not?

35:21.988 --> 35:25.685
_

35:27.007 --> 35:29.876
I've got the Cubs on line one.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.615
- Hey.
- What's up, Oscar?

35:34.625 --> 35:36.554
I hear you're looking for a setup guy.

35:36.564 --> 35:37.560
What about Gordon?

35:37.570 --> 35:39.003
You just got him. What's wrong with him?

35:39.039 --> 35:40.538
Nothing. He threw two shutout innings

35:40.573 --> 35:43.207
for us yesterday,
but I need a center fielder.

35:43.243 --> 35:44.509
I'm thinking Steve Hale.

35:44.544 --> 35:45.576
You've got Blip Sanders.

35:45.612 --> 35:46.778
I need another one.

35:46.813 --> 35:49.280
I want more than Gordon for Hale.

35:56.652 --> 36:00.088
_

36:04.689 --> 36:06.030
Come in.

36:08.068 --> 36:09.413
Hey.

36:09.423 --> 36:10.593
How are you?

36:10.603 --> 36:12.470
I'm okay.

36:12.505 --> 36:15.139
- Did you hear anything?
- No, not yet.

36:18.278 --> 36:20.195
I'm sorry about last night.

36:20.451 --> 36:23.381
No, you had every right. It's not
your job to make me feel better.

36:24.417 --> 36:25.650
Would you mind if, uh...

36:25.685 --> 36:28.119
just hang out in here, just kind
of wait out the next ten minutes?

36:28.154 --> 36:29.824
Of course.

36:31.096 --> 36:34.425
Mike's jokes about
Cleveland are getting old.

36:39.961 --> 36:42.083
_

36:42.093 --> 36:45.169
Now, you know I
can't do two-for-one. I...

36:46.197 --> 36:48.320
How about a left-handed reliever?

36:49.743 --> 36:51.937
- You've got yourself a deal.
- Thank you.

36:52.271 --> 36:54.351
Get the Angels front office on the line.

36:59.046 --> 37:00.094
What's that?

37:00.104 --> 37:02.689
Your wife just made a move
on Words With Friends.

37:02.699 --> 37:04.455
I need to change my alerts.

37:04.491 --> 37:05.823
Oh...

37:05.859 --> 37:07.340
We're in if you are.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.971
All right, it's a done...

37:09.773 --> 37:12.530
Hold on. Puts us $250K over budget.

37:15.201 --> 37:17.435
If you kick in $300 grand to cover

37:17.470 --> 37:20.265
what I'm getting back from
the Cubs, it's a deal.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.084
Done.

37:34.721 --> 37:36.954
- Thank you.
- Yes!

37:48.630 --> 37:50.968
Rhonda, make a note.

37:51.004 --> 37:53.256
That's the Ross I like.

38:00.191 --> 38:01.879
Ten seconds.

38:14.060 --> 38:15.929
You're staying.

38:22.268 --> 38:23.901
Let's go.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.323
Hey, I just heard the news.

38:37.333 --> 38:38.683
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

38:38.718 --> 38:40.251
Told you.

38:40.286 --> 38:41.852
- No limits.
- No limits.

38:41.888 --> 38:43.611
- All right. Get over here.
- All right.

38:43.621 --> 38:45.523
All right, now it's on
to the waiver wire.

38:45.558 --> 38:46.747
- Sorry?
- Yeah, well,

38:46.757 --> 38:48.526
when you're done celebrating,
come up to my office.

38:48.561 --> 38:50.061
We're not done dealing.

38:50.096 --> 38:51.262
- What?
- Yeah, we got

38:51.297 --> 38:53.030
a Cuban catcher in
Triple-A tearing it up.

38:53.066 --> 38:54.198
We need to make some room.

38:54.234 --> 38:56.573
No, uh, Lawson has a no-trade clause.

38:56.583 --> 38:59.971
Which is why you have to figure
out how to make it his idea.

39:05.345 --> 39:07.945
- I think I need a root canal.
- Yeah.

39:07.981 --> 39:10.214
And I don't know if you've all heard,

39:10.283 --> 39:12.526
but Butch Hunter's been traded again.

39:12.536 --> 39:14.285
I think you're having
a case of déjà vu, sir.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.853
The Cubs just shipped him.

39:15.888 --> 39:18.089
- Where'd he end up?
- Well, he was part of

39:18.124 --> 39:19.824
the Dom Cristiello three-way,

39:19.859 --> 39:21.959
so he's right back where he belongs.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.930
Welcome back, Butch.

39:28.385 --> 39:29.634
He's back.

39:29.669 --> 39:31.135
Tommy, your boy's back.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.140
They sent him to the Cubs
about 15 minutes ago.

40:10.877 --> 40:12.176
Amelia.

40:14.235 --> 40:15.503
Hey.

40:16.015 --> 40:18.137
I, uh, bought you another gift.

40:18.147 --> 40:20.279
- Are you kidding me?
- No, it's the, um...

40:20.289 --> 40:22.624
it's a Superflow.

40:22.634 --> 40:24.792
It's the best mouth guard I could find.

40:24.802 --> 40:27.625
Actually, my clubby bought it.

40:28.210 --> 40:30.892
You know, my night guard's custom made.

40:30.902 --> 40:33.064
They take X-rays,
make a mold of my mouth.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.618
It's, like, a whole thing.

40:34.628 --> 40:36.967
- Oh, so...
- Which is

40:37.384 --> 40:40.004
why I started carrying it with me...

40:41.465 --> 40:45.409
so that I don't have to rush back
to my place to sleep at night.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.768
I think there's something we should do.

40:55.421 --> 40:57.888
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.914
- You know, JLo was a Fly Girl.
- What?

41:05.942 --> 41:08.311
Are you letting them watch that?

41:08.321 --> 41:11.333
- You know they're only seven.
- And a half.

41:14.459 --> 41:15.877
Hey!

41:15.887 --> 41:17.875
Y'all are in for a treat
in a couple years.

41:17.910 --> 41:19.276
Okay,

41:19.312 --> 41:20.911
five or six years.

41:21.292 --> 41:23.381
That's right.

41:23.416 --> 41:24.949
'Cause homie don't play that.

41:29.843 --> 41:31.646
Quick, turn it back on.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.197
Hey, Mon!

41:34.060 --> 41:36.460
It's time again for another

41:36.529 --> 41:38.362
episode of "Hey Mon,"

41:38.398 --> 41:40.030
with the hardest working
West Indian family,

41:40.066 --> 41:42.013
the Hedleys.

41:47.229 --> 41:48.739
Hey, Gin, wait up.

41:50.443 --> 41:51.894
- I need to talk to you.
- What's up?

41:51.904 --> 41:53.719
You're using your serious voice.

41:53.729 --> 41:57.148
Nothing serious.

41:57.183 --> 41:58.983
I just wanted to let you know that

41:59.018 --> 42:01.889
Mike Lawson and I have
been seeing each other,

42:02.197 --> 42:04.054
just for a few weeks.

42:04.090 --> 42:05.589
Oh.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.224
Um, okay.

42:07.738 --> 42:09.756
I just... I wanted you to know.

42:10.430 --> 42:12.763
Yeah, sure. It's your personal life.

42:12.832 --> 42:14.298
It's your business.

42:14.333 --> 42:15.666
If you're happy, I'm happy.

42:15.701 --> 42:17.170
It's not a big deal,

42:17.180 --> 42:19.470
but I didn't want you to
find out from anybody else.

42:19.505 --> 42:20.727
Sure.

42:22.242 --> 42:24.074
- I got to get dressed for the game.
- Okay.

42:24.110 --> 42:25.403
Okay.
