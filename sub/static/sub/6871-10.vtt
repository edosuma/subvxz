WEBVTT

00:00.794 --> 00:03.805
- Come on, you know you want it.
- You don't know what I want.

00:03.925 --> 00:06.548
Oh, yes, I do.
Come on, just the tip.

00:06.772 --> 00:10.172
I don't know. It's pretty big.
I think it's just the

00:10.292 --> 00:14.156
standard breakfast burrito size.
Here, first take a bite of mine.

00:14.276 --> 00:17.255
No, first you take a bite of mine.
Let's do it together.

00:17.375 --> 00:22.829
- Is that crazy? Oh, my God, okay.
- Mmm.

00:28.045 --> 00:32.012
- Oh, my, God. - Men's room?
- Broom closet.

00:32.014 --> 00:36.984
It's dirtier. No, bring the burrito.
Oh, my, God!

00:40.875 --> 00:44.390
Well, we were all thinkin' it.

00:44.392 --> 00:47.393
That and how chili's not
breakfast.

00:47.395 --> 00:50.396
Well, technically anything's breakfast,
if it's your first meal of the day.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.329
Oh, then Ray's right.
And also, duh.

00:53.449 --> 00:56.173
Well, hooray. Give yourself a hand.
You know what?

00:56.293 --> 00:59.671
I know you better sit your ass down
before I slam an Easy Spirit up it.

00:59.673 --> 01:02.741
Oooh!
Whoa, hey, Pam, Ray, come on you two.

01:02.743 --> 01:06.325
You're not mad at each other.
You're mad at the unspeakably revolting

01:06.370 --> 01:07.970
symbiotic mass of bodily fluids

01:08.039 --> 01:09.160
that is now Archer and Lana.

01:09.173 --> 01:10.939
They make me sick!

01:11.008 --> 01:13.042
Rub it in our faces how
we're doomed to be alone.

01:13.110 --> 01:15.611
Well, your face.
And Ray's, I guess.

01:15.679 --> 01:18.113
Wait, nobody's
rubbin' off in my face.

01:18.182 --> 01:20.343
Yeah, that's her point. And
think how hard watching them

01:20.351 --> 01:22.484
must be for Cyril.
No! It's--

01:22.553 --> 01:24.420
That's not--
I mean, come on!

01:24.488 --> 01:26.658
I'm totally over Lana, so...
Cyril!

01:26.778 --> 01:27.868
You can lie to yourself...

01:27.988 --> 01:30.887
- Obviously, look at your sweater.
- ...but don't lie to Team Breakup.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.850
- Uh what?
- Guys, it's obvious what we gotta do.

01:33.970 --> 01:36.504
Throw acid in their kissy faces.

01:36.573 --> 01:37.939
No!
Wait!

01:38.007 --> 01:39.707
You want to try
to break them up?

01:39.776 --> 01:41.909
I mean, it's either that or...
Ssss...

01:41.978 --> 01:45.713
No! The solution to every problem
isn't throwing frickin' acid on it!

01:45.782 --> 01:49.417
Unless the problem is a solution
with an overly-alkaline Ph balance.

01:49.486 --> 01:51.986
Krieger, hush! Pam?
You have a plan?

01:52.055 --> 01:54.555
I don't know. Maybe we could do
something like one of those bait cars?

01:54.624 --> 01:56.891
But obviously, the car
would be a vagina.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.759
Hmm. Okay,
so we get a woman

01:58.828 --> 02:00.561
that Archer would
find irresistible.

02:00.630 --> 02:02.363
Maybe by having
her fog a mirror.

02:02.432 --> 02:03.632
Then put her in Archer's path,

02:03.700 --> 02:05.021
and his pathological
need to sleep

02:05.034 --> 02:07.001
with every woman
he meets does the rest.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.570
Or, you know, a lot of couples
break up if their kid dies.

02:09.639 --> 02:10.604
Really?
Whoa!

02:10.673 --> 02:12.373
Yeah. Easy peasy.

02:12.442 --> 02:15.610
We hire somebody to kidnap
their fat, gross baby.

02:15.645 --> 02:17.728
There's this huge
man-slash-baby hunt.

02:17.814 --> 02:19.530
It's in all the newspapers.

02:19.616 --> 02:21.816
On the wireless.
America's going apeshit.

02:21.885 --> 02:23.951
Then, we double-cross
the kidnapper,

02:24.020 --> 02:26.821
who obviously we paid with
easily-traceable gold certificates.

02:26.906 --> 02:29.874
We plant a shitload of
dicey evidence in his garage.

02:29.959 --> 02:32.793
Tip off the cops-- he's basically
convicted of being German,

02:32.829 --> 02:34.545
and then, bzz-zap!

02:34.631 --> 02:37.665
Dirtnap for the kraut!
Compliments of old Sparky.

02:37.734 --> 02:39.400
God damn!
Wireless?

02:39.469 --> 02:41.402
But wait. If it's
a kidnapping--

02:41.471 --> 02:44.005
Uhh! The child
is sent to Bhutan,

02:44.057 --> 02:46.757
where for the next 20 years, she's
raised and trained as an assassin

02:46.843 --> 02:48.809
by Ra's al Ghul before
returning to destroy

02:48.845 --> 02:50.077
those who once betrayed her.

02:50.146 --> 02:52.013
Us.

02:52.081 --> 02:56.450
Yes!
But it buys us time.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.772
Oh, my God, Lana.

03:34.892 --> 03:36.591
That was insane!

03:36.643 --> 03:38.426
It's insane, like,
every time now.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.562
What is going on with you?

03:40.631 --> 03:43.165
- Go-going on with me how?
What do you mean? - I mean--

03:43.233 --> 03:44.579
and uh, don't take this
the wrong way, but--

03:44.699 --> 03:46.701
did your dick get bigger?

03:46.770 --> 03:48.637
I don't think so.
Is that a thing?

03:48.705 --> 03:50.438
I think I would
have heard of it!

03:50.507 --> 03:52.340
Wait, in <i> Le Retour</i>
<i>de Martin Guerre,</i>

03:52.409 --> 03:54.910
didn't his get bigger?
Nope. His feet got smaller.

03:54.978 --> 03:57.579
Oh. Well, I know
my feet are the same.

03:57.648 --> 04:00.448
His wife fell in love with him when
he came back because he was caring

04:00.517 --> 04:02.484
and loving, which
he wasn't before.

04:02.553 --> 04:04.719
Larger penis
probably didn't hurt.

04:04.788 --> 04:06.421
And I'm sure my feet
are the same, Lana.

04:06.490 --> 04:08.290
My cordwainer
would have said something.

04:08.358 --> 04:09.624
Well, whatever it is,
for some reason

04:09.693 --> 04:11.726
I don't have to suppress
my gag reflex now

04:11.795 --> 04:13.261
whenever you mention
your cordwainer.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.330
Well, what should I call him?
A shoemaker?

04:15.399 --> 04:17.565
What I'm trying to say is,
you were different

04:17.634 --> 04:19.209
than you were when
you dated the first time.

04:19.329 --> 04:23.051
More mature, maybe? And
definitely more focused on me.

04:23.171 --> 04:26.781
- Well? - As opposed to every single
woman you meet in a bar

04:26.901 --> 04:29.644
or at a party or just merely
walking down the street.

04:29.713 --> 04:33.415
I-- yeah. Uh. I'm sorry for that... time.
Zzz.

04:33.483 --> 04:36.551
Times, yes. Plural.
And I promise you,

04:36.620 --> 04:39.054
that won't ever happen again.
It better not.

04:39.122 --> 04:41.590
Because this time--
It's really kinda good, right?

04:41.658 --> 04:44.292
No, Archer, it's great!
Somehow.

04:44.361 --> 04:46.428
I can't remember when
I was this happy!

04:46.496 --> 04:48.463
You recently gave birth
to a child.

04:48.532 --> 04:50.832
Shit, right!

04:50.901 --> 04:54.536
But besides that, this is the
happiest I've been in a while!

04:54.605 --> 04:56.986
Which, obviously, is why we can't
tell mother we're dating again.

04:57.106 --> 04:59.705
Obvious?
Because she'd try to break us up somehow.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.765
She can't stand for me
to be in a relationship.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.134
I think it actually
causes her physical pain.

05:04.202 --> 05:07.370
You realize your relationship with
Malory isn't a huge selling point?

05:07.439 --> 05:10.373
Y-yeah. So, to
make up for it, what say I

05:10.442 --> 05:12.208
bend you back over the mop sink?

05:12.277 --> 05:13.977
Bring it, Sommersby.

05:14.046 --> 05:16.747
Because, you ding dong,
our bait-car hooker

05:16.778 --> 05:18.222
has to be hotter than Lana.

05:18.342 --> 05:20.772
- Pfft, that won't be hard!
- What?

05:20.892 --> 05:22.267
Did you suddenly go blind?

05:22.387 --> 05:24.788
No, phew!

05:24.856 --> 05:27.023
But Pam, come on. The
prostitutes on this website

05:27.092 --> 05:28.758
are like--
jeezy petes!

05:28.827 --> 05:30.226
Some of them are 10,000 a night!

05:30.295 --> 05:32.329
Yeah. So two grand apiece!
Are you--

05:32.397 --> 05:35.265
I wouldn't even pay
$2,000 to get myself laid.

05:35.334 --> 05:38.868
Well, maybe now, but a few more
weeks without that hand...

05:38.937 --> 05:42.205
That's not even the hand-- I don't
see how that's any of your beeswax!

05:42.274 --> 05:45.175
Speaking of, do I smell beeswax?

05:45.243 --> 05:48.345
- Probably. - Maybe you can pay one of these
high-class hookers with it.

05:48.413 --> 05:50.146
- Really?
- No!

05:50.215 --> 05:53.183
Damn.
Because I'm not chipping in 2,000 bucks.

05:53.251 --> 05:57.053
Or even 1,000. Because I just
found out our shitty insurance

05:57.122 --> 05:59.222
doesn't cover prosthetic limbs!
Really?

05:59.291 --> 06:01.791
How do you not--
you're head of H.R.!

06:01.860 --> 06:03.500
Probably because
I got two frickin' hands!

06:08.467 --> 06:10.266
Earballs.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.402
If I wanted to hear
you people scream,

06:12.471 --> 06:15.472
I'd have you flown
to a CIA black site

06:15.540 --> 06:18.875
in Morocco and listen to your
torture session on speakerphone!

06:18.944 --> 06:21.945
Speaking of, any word from Slater?
No.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.148
Not a word from the CIA since
you idiots ruined the mission

06:25.217 --> 06:27.517
with the Durhani royal family.

06:27.586 --> 06:30.020
So I have no idea
what our status is.

06:30.088 --> 06:32.055
For all I know, we're
wanted for treason again.

06:32.124 --> 06:34.024
Well, no news is good news.

06:34.092 --> 06:37.060
You do realize this is
an intelligence agency?

06:37.129 --> 06:38.495
Ostensibly.
What?

06:38.563 --> 06:41.131
Nothing.

06:41.199 --> 06:44.067
Yeesh. Why don't we just
tell her they're dating?

06:44.136 --> 06:46.102
She'll make them so crazy
they'll break up on their own.

06:46.171 --> 06:48.138
Because then she would
tell them we told her,

06:48.206 --> 06:50.106
and then even if I did want
Lana back-- which I don't--

06:50.175 --> 06:51.508
It wouldn't matter!

06:51.576 --> 06:53.543
Because Mr. Archer would
feed you your own bones!

06:53.612 --> 06:55.945
Well, I don't know about <i> that!</i>

06:56.014 --> 06:57.981
Please. You'd die
of marrow poisoning.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.649
So come on!
Let's pick a hooker!

06:59.718 --> 07:02.886
One that Archer's never had sex with.
Is there one?

07:02.954 --> 07:05.821
You're forgetting what the largest
sex organ on the human body is.

07:05.941 --> 07:07.655
The... penis?

07:07.775 --> 07:09.259
Well, I was gonna say vagina.

07:09.327 --> 07:11.294
I was gonna say Pam's vagina.
Me too.

07:11.363 --> 07:12.362
The brain!

07:12.431 --> 07:13.963
Eww!
Eww!

07:14.032 --> 07:15.065
Not like that-- what is
wrong with you people?

07:15.133 --> 07:16.633
Ray's missing a hand.

07:16.701 --> 07:18.935
Archer won't risk
his relationship with Lana

07:19.004 --> 07:21.471
for a previous conquest--
especially a prostitute!

07:21.540 --> 07:24.040
For a man like him,
it's all about the hunt.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.376
They're all gonna have--
I said <i> hunt.</i>

07:26.445 --> 07:29.913
Oh. Still, though...
So we have to pay a hooker up front

07:29.981 --> 07:32.954
to bump into Archer somewhere and just hope
he's never banged her?

07:33.074 --> 07:36.173
Come on, it's New York. I bet it's 20,000
hookers here.

07:36.293 --> 07:39.154
What are the odds Mr. Archer already banged
whichever one we pick?

07:39.274 --> 07:40.490
I was gonna say 50/50.

07:40.559 --> 07:42.992
Me too.
I was gonna say "Pam's vagina."

07:43.061 --> 07:44.928
So, we have to find
a beautiful woman

07:44.996 --> 07:47.497
who Archer's never had sex with.
Or--

07:47.566 --> 07:49.566
Well, that counts me out.
Me too.

07:49.634 --> 07:51.835
Which part?
Keep it up, Stumplestiltskin.

07:51.903 --> 07:53.697
Or, both of you shut up.

07:53.817 --> 07:57.941
Better yet, a woman who has a powerful
psychological hold over Archer.

07:58.009 --> 08:00.610
Please, tell me
you don't mean his mother.

08:00.679 --> 08:02.278
What?
Yeah, because even for us--

08:02.347 --> 08:04.247
I'm not talking
about Miss Archer!

08:04.316 --> 08:07.650
The only woman Archer ever really
cared about besides Lana is...

08:07.719 --> 08:10.153
What? Who?

08:10.222 --> 08:11.955
Seriously?
Yeah. Who is it?

08:12.023 --> 08:15.258
Hang on, before we call her,
are we sure we want to do this?

08:15.327 --> 08:18.061
No, you're my smoochy-boochy.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.563
No, you're my
smoochy-boochy.

08:20.632 --> 08:21.998
Eww.
Ugh.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.900
So. Is there
a country code, or--

08:23.969 --> 08:27.871
Da? Yes.
This is Colonel Kazanova.

08:27.906 --> 08:30.106
Yes. Oh, really?

08:30.175 --> 08:33.208
Yes? Yes?
I understand.

08:33.278 --> 08:36.044
Yeah. Yes.
Good-bye.

08:36.114 --> 08:38.681
Who was that?
Who was who?

08:38.750 --> 08:41.284
What are you talking about?
Uh-- you were--

08:41.352 --> 08:44.487
Did you just now have telephone call?
No!

08:44.556 --> 08:48.057
Don't be an idiot.
Also, I must go to America.

08:48.126 --> 08:51.528
Unrelated to the telephone call
that I just did not receive.

08:57.017 --> 08:59.084
Cyril!
Archer.

08:59.153 --> 09:01.753
How are you holding up, buddy?
With regard to--

09:01.822 --> 09:03.755
Me and Lana?

09:04.039 --> 09:05.905
Oh-ho. Right.
Gotta be tough, huh?

09:05.974 --> 09:08.341
Yeah, I'm barely
muddling through.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.610
I'm sensing a little sarcasm.

09:10.679 --> 09:13.179
Really?
Yes, Cyril, I am.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.016
Maybe that's because I don't
care that you're dating Lana,

09:16.084 --> 09:19.019
because...
you'll never have what she and I had.

09:19.087 --> 09:21.087
Like what?
Like... uh...

09:21.156 --> 09:22.522
I don't know, Archer.
The little things.

09:22.591 --> 09:24.524
Like Stir Friday.
You're right, Cyril.

09:24.593 --> 09:27.494
Nothing I could do could ever
compare to the sensual pleasures

09:27.562 --> 09:31.164
to be found in a greasy wok
full of tiny ears of corn

09:31.233 --> 09:34.234
and meat the exact size
and shape of dice. Which--

09:34.302 --> 09:38.238
You just realized is why that method
of chopping food is called "dicing."

09:38.306 --> 09:40.874
Maybe. And maybe
since it's Friday, Cyril,

09:40.942 --> 09:43.943
tonight, I'm gonna make
Lana stir-fry!

09:44.012 --> 09:48.181
You-- what? No!
Yes! So, soy you later!

09:50.519 --> 09:52.452
"Soy!"

09:52.521 --> 09:56.389
Operation Stir Cry-day
is go, over.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.825
Copy that, Figgis Newton.
What?

09:58.894 --> 10:00.827
And also, shitty operation name.

10:00.896 --> 10:02.562
Why can't you use the women's?

10:02.631 --> 10:06.433
And why'd you give me a walkie-talkie?
Why do you care?

10:06.501 --> 10:08.268
- About either?
<i>- Wait. What?</i>

10:08.336 --> 10:11.337
Dinner? Tonight?
My place? I'll cook.

10:11.406 --> 10:13.540
What is this,
like a word scramble?

10:13.608 --> 10:15.542
No, it's like
me cooking you dinner.

10:15.610 --> 10:19.345
You, as in, Woodhouse?
No, me as in me, Lana.

10:19.414 --> 10:21.014
I don't even know
where Woodhouse is.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.849
I actually haven't seen
him in, like, weeks.

10:22.918 --> 10:24.217
Uh-huh.

10:24.286 --> 10:26.953
I'm cooking.
Me, Lana. Me. Me!

10:27.022 --> 10:31.591
You two and your constant
bickering. What is it this time?

10:31.660 --> 10:33.960
Lana's hogging the copier.

10:34.029 --> 10:37.230
I swear to sweet Jesus...
Okay, Julia Childish.

10:37.299 --> 10:40.100
I'll get a sitter for A.J.
So, what time is dinner?

10:40.168 --> 10:42.335
And can I bring anything?
Let's say sevenish,

10:42.404 --> 10:46.473
and yes, you can bring
100 copies of this.

10:49.478 --> 10:52.011
Wait. What?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.681
Come on!

10:54.750 --> 10:57.717
Sorry, I had to get
stakeout supplies, and--

10:57.786 --> 11:00.587
What happened to your van?
We can't stake out Archer's apartment

11:00.655 --> 11:03.024
in the rush van,
it's way too iconic.

11:03.144 --> 11:04.883
Wait, this is actual ice cream.

11:05.003 --> 11:06.991
Plus, I've been moonlighting.

11:09.231 --> 11:12.265
Shut up!
Okay, little help here, nerm-nerts.

11:12.334 --> 11:15.101
Think you got enough beer?
No.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.103
But I brought a couple joints.

11:21.042 --> 11:23.409
No, it's cool.
I got it, Woodhouse.

11:23.478 --> 11:26.146
Unless you came home?
You little scamp!

11:26.214 --> 11:29.215
Woodhouse? Woodhouse!

11:29.284 --> 11:32.235
Seriously, I hope he didn't die.

11:32.954 --> 11:36.489
Meemo. Check obituaries.

11:36.558 --> 11:39.431
Meemo. Tell Woodhouse
to buy newspap-- damn!

11:39.551 --> 11:40.683
No, that's just a feedback loop.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.787
Wha--
God damn it, Woodhouse, you stack of bones,

11:44.856 --> 11:47.313
if you're using my bathroom,
you're gonna need an obitu--

11:47.433 --> 11:48.273
What the--

11:48.393 --> 11:49.634
Woodhouse?

11:49.908 --> 11:53.451
No, my darling. It is I!
Katya?

11:53.545 --> 11:56.196
Well, you sound
surprised, darling.

11:56.265 --> 11:58.365
Well, wh--
Why are you in my bathroom?

11:58.434 --> 12:00.467
Oh, I was just preparing.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.636
In my apartment.
In America!

12:02.705 --> 12:05.105
Oh, I just had
to see you, darling.

12:05.174 --> 12:07.841
I have been longing
for your tender touch.

12:07.910 --> 12:09.843
Well-- but just, like,
out of the blue?

12:09.912 --> 12:12.012
Was Barry's touch
not tender? Or--

12:12.081 --> 12:14.381
I-- how you say, uh--
"dump" Barry.

12:14.450 --> 12:16.950
All right!
You knew this?

12:17.019 --> 12:19.886
I assumed it was
bound to happen,

12:19.955 --> 12:21.955
since Barry was such a douche.

12:22.024 --> 12:24.024
And still is. Presumably.

12:24.093 --> 12:26.960
And also alive, and not crushed
and then burned to death

12:27.029 --> 12:29.329
in a grain silo. Presumably.

12:29.398 --> 12:33.233
What is the matter, darling?
Are you not excited to see your Katya?

12:33.302 --> 12:36.236
Mm... no, "excited" is actually
the exact word I would have cho--

12:36.305 --> 12:38.538
ho-ho-haw-- oh.

12:38.607 --> 12:41.108
Oh, my God!

12:41.176 --> 12:43.376
This is, like, the perfect day.

12:43.445 --> 12:46.613
Ahh! The day Archer finally
gets what's been coming to him

12:46.682 --> 12:48.582
all these years.

12:48.650 --> 12:51.618
So, wait. When did you put all
those cameras in his apartment?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.020
The same time I did the rest of--
you know what's good?

12:54.089 --> 12:57.157
<i>Hochschiebens!</i>
Yeah, let's all have a <i> hochschieben!</i>

12:57.226 --> 12:59.259
Mmm!<i> Das ist lecker,</i> no?

12:59.328 --> 13:03.130
Yes! I mean, no.
I mean, my neck's all sweaty.

13:03.198 --> 13:06.032
It can't possibly taste good, so--

13:06.101 --> 13:10.270
I love, is-- is salty.
It's like caviar.

13:10.339 --> 13:13.507
Which, boy! Talk about
an acquired taste, huh?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.809
And a little-known fact--

13:15.878 --> 13:19.597
Uh, darling, you're on fire!
Oh, my God. Yeah.

13:19.717 --> 13:21.269
- So are you.
- No.

13:21.389 --> 13:23.414
- Literally.
- You mean figuratively.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.801
Oh, God, there's so much we never
had time to...

13:28.173 --> 13:30.390
Uh, darling, there.
The champagne.

13:32.661 --> 13:36.062
Oh, ho. Very high in cholesterol.
Caviar.

13:36.131 --> 13:39.966
Darling, are you all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.

13:40.035 --> 13:43.136
Messrs. Kilgour, French, Stanbury,
Turnbull and Asser... not so much.

13:43.205 --> 13:46.473
Oh, well, then let's get
you out of these wet clothes,

13:46.542 --> 13:48.575
and into something...
Dry?

13:50.379 --> 13:53.947
Oh, I can promise you,
it is not dry.

14:02.491 --> 14:04.090
Blorp.

14:04.159 --> 14:08.128
Well, in the immortal words
of Wendell Stamps,

14:08.197 --> 14:10.630
that's going in the slide show!

14:10.699 --> 14:12.682
No offense.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.684
Why would I be offen--

14:23.880 --> 14:26.714
<i>Oh, baby, it is all over everything.</i>

14:26.782 --> 14:28.983
So is Cheryl.
Will you get off?

14:29.051 --> 14:31.519
That's what she said, right?

14:31.587 --> 14:34.221
More like what <i> he</i> said.
<i>Katya, please.</i>

14:34.290 --> 14:36.423
Please, I have
to tell you something.

14:36.492 --> 14:39.193
I'm listening.
Go ahead, baby.

14:39.262 --> 14:41.395
They're jingling, baby.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.105
I didn't know you were a fan of
early crossover mainstream hip-hop.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.734
Oh! Or that you were
that strong.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.903
Oh, my God. I'm glad
I'm not a woman.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.674
<i>Da,</i> baby,<i> ya tozhe.</i>

14:50.794 --> 14:52.969
No, in a general sense. Look!

14:53.089 --> 14:54.466
<i>Look, look, look, look!</i>
<i>Here comes Lana!</i>

14:54.586 --> 14:56.776
<i>Oh, man, I don't want to
sound greedy,</i>

14:56.896 --> 14:58.729
but a threesome
and then a break-up?

14:58.814 --> 15:02.182
Or a foursome,
and I'm the pizza guy?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.251
You have pizza?

15:12.261 --> 15:14.328
Dahlink, I do not understand.

15:14.397 --> 15:18.098
I know, and me neither. This is
all uncharted territory for me.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.301
But I've changed, Katya.
I've changed.

15:20.369 --> 15:23.337
Well, I have also changed.
My new operating system

15:23.406 --> 15:26.273
includes the entire kama sutra...
Wow! Okay.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.777
The first edition of the old Mr. Boston
Official Bartender's Guide...

15:29.845 --> 15:32.913
Eep!
And a deep, hard-wired

15:32.982 --> 15:36.150
understanding and appreciation
of men's lacrosse.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.453
What did I--
darling, wait!

15:42.358 --> 15:43.857
What?
Out o' order.

15:43.926 --> 15:45.993
Yes, thank you.
I can see that.

15:46.062 --> 15:47.661
Why you ask?

15:49.332 --> 15:52.499
Out of order?
I'll show you out of order.

15:52.568 --> 15:55.369
Lana Kane?
The giant negress?

15:55.438 --> 15:57.171
Hey! Now come on. She's not--
What?

15:57.239 --> 15:59.473
A negress?
Gigantic.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.476
I mean, she's tall, but a lot of
that's the boots, and the hair--

16:02.545 --> 16:05.779
and those hands aren't doing her
any favors, human-size-wise.

16:05.848 --> 16:09.850
She's basically Groot.

16:09.919 --> 16:12.753
I mean, in the dark it's like Eubie
Blake's reaching out for you, but--

16:12.822 --> 16:15.289
But you prefer her to me?

16:15.358 --> 16:18.926
I mean, no, but wait. You slept
with Barry at our wedding!

16:18.995 --> 16:21.829
Da-ah! At second wedding.
Oh. Right.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.031
At our first wedding--
I saved your life from Barry,

16:24.100 --> 16:26.233
and in process,
I lose my own life!

16:26.302 --> 16:30.104
But then again, you slept with him
at our second wedding, which kinda--

16:30.172 --> 16:34.108
You were the one who could not deal
with the fact that I am now cyborg!

16:34.176 --> 16:36.977
You were the one who banged Barry!
<i> Bozhe moy!</i>

16:37.046 --> 16:40.247
You have not changed a bit!
Ha! Shows what you know!

16:40.316 --> 16:42.850
You Barry-banger!
I have changed!

16:42.918 --> 16:45.085
I have a kid!

16:45.154 --> 16:47.421
<i>Chto?</i>

16:47.490 --> 16:52.159
Yeah. A little baby girl,
Abbiejean. With Lana.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.895
And then we started going out
again, and somehow it's...

16:54.964 --> 16:56.764
Kind of amazing, really.

16:56.832 --> 16:58.912
We're, like, connecting,
you know? And I realize that

16:58.963 --> 17:03.971
all this time, even though we fought
like cats and a very tall dog,

17:04.040 --> 17:06.373
we've always been best friends.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.525
<i>And then to realize you
might actually be in love</i>

17:08.645 --> 17:11.992
<i>with your best friend who also happens to</i>
<i>be the mother of your child--</i>

17:12.112 --> 17:14.375
<i>That's, like, a miracle.</i>

17:15.017 --> 17:18.018
And so even though I'll always
have a special place for you

17:18.087 --> 17:21.320
in my heart, and obviously in my slide show, I--
Your what?

17:21.390 --> 17:24.023
It doesn't matter. I--
I feel like I just found Lana

17:24.093 --> 17:27.261
after all these years, and I
can't risk losing her again.

17:27.329 --> 17:29.196
I--

17:29.265 --> 17:31.965
Don't know what to say,
Sterling.

17:32.034 --> 17:35.302
I feel--
I feel like--

17:37.306 --> 17:40.040
A great big, jerky
giant asshole.

17:40.109 --> 17:42.543
Right!

17:42.611 --> 17:45.345
Well? Are we just
gonna sit here?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.985
Lazy, lazy, fatty
fatty <i> gaijin!</i> Whee!

17:53.489 --> 17:57.491
I mean, how do you not
murder her every day?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.993
I do.

18:00.062 --> 18:02.362
No, please, I feel
like the asshole.

18:02.431 --> 18:06.100
I mean, look at you. I literally
cannot believe I'm asking you to go.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.401
But you must.

18:07.470 --> 18:10.337
Yeah. I've seen her
crush a cue ball.

18:10.406 --> 18:13.173
Oh, I forgot something in bathroom.
I'll mail it to you.

18:13.242 --> 18:15.576
But you got to go now!
She'll be here any second.

18:15.644 --> 18:19.913
Whoo! Suck it, you...
dick stairs.

18:21.617 --> 18:24.551
Is a bit awkward,
to leave from balcony.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.987
I know, sorry, but
the elevator's out,

18:27.056 --> 18:29.456
and I can just see you two running
into each other on the stairs.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.226
Uh, no, I mean because the last
time I leave your apartment

18:32.294 --> 18:34.261
from balcony--
Oh, right!

18:34.330 --> 18:36.130
You died.
But the last time,

18:36.198 --> 18:37.364
I did not have this.

18:39.869 --> 18:44.271
- Wow. - <i>Da.</i> It is also very good
for bondage, mild BDSM,

18:44.340 --> 18:45.625
things of this nature.

18:45.887 --> 18:49.109
I bet.
May I kiss you good-bye, Sterling?

18:49.178 --> 18:51.378
Yes. Yes, pleas--

18:53.716 --> 18:57.217
I will miss you. Very much.

18:57.286 --> 18:59.520
Me too. But if
it's any consolation,

18:59.588 --> 19:03.357
I'll be thinking of you the next...
several times I have sex with Lana.

19:03.425 --> 19:06.326
Well, good-bye...

19:06.395 --> 19:08.061
Sterling.

19:10.366 --> 19:14.334
Oh, holy shit, I
got to make stir-fry.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.437
Why is the door open?
That's weird.

19:17.506 --> 19:20.107
Lana!
What? What the shit?

19:20.176 --> 19:22.109
There's--
Oh, I got a stitch.

19:22.178 --> 19:23.477
What are you idiots doing here?

19:23.845 --> 19:25.668
What am I even doing here?

19:26.067 --> 19:29.635
<i>Well, Archer, the first thing you're
doing is making a very stiff drink.</i>

19:29.755 --> 19:30.872
Well?

19:30.992 --> 19:32.992
Cyril? You gotta...
What?

19:33.061 --> 19:35.295
Cyril's gotta...
tell you something.

19:35.363 --> 19:37.230
No I don't!
Yeah, you do.

19:37.299 --> 19:39.866
Yeah, Cyril!
That is just...

19:39.935 --> 19:43.136
Cyril! What?

19:43.205 --> 19:45.406
Lana, please don't go in there
because I still love you.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.440
There. I said it.

19:47.509 --> 19:50.076
Wow.
Yeah!

19:50.145 --> 19:52.846
Ha!

19:52.914 --> 19:56.716
So. How's all that going?

19:56.785 --> 19:58.485
Not great.

19:58.553 --> 20:01.588
Jesus, Woodhouse
really is gone, huh?

20:01.656 --> 20:04.591
Which-- here are your flyers.
Yeah, I actually don't need them.

20:04.659 --> 20:06.526
What? After I made
all these copies?

20:06.595 --> 20:08.628
Well, who's gonna put 'em up, Lana?
Hey! Whoa.

20:08.697 --> 20:12.232
I did not just schlep my ass up your
jillion idiot stairs

20:12.300 --> 20:14.534
- to eat your shitty attitude
for dinner, mister. - I--

20:14.603 --> 20:18.037
I might as well go eat with Cyril.
At least he can cook stir-fry.

20:18.106 --> 20:20.406
And, he's still totally in love with me.
Wha'?

20:20.475 --> 20:24.043
Yeah. Right outside, just dumped his
purse all over the welcome mat.

20:24.112 --> 20:26.212
Ugh! So pathetic.

20:26.248 --> 20:29.082
Seriously. Maybe
try growing a pair.

20:29.151 --> 20:31.484
But here I am with the old Archer.
Wha'--

20:31.553 --> 20:34.420
I'm not the old Archer.
I'm the new Archer!

20:34.489 --> 20:37.557
I've changed, Lana.
Please, you're halfway to half in the bag.

20:37.626 --> 20:40.059
As usual, walkin' around
in your--

20:40.128 --> 20:41.995
Why are you in your spreefs?

20:42.063 --> 20:44.264
They compliment
my active lifestyle?

20:44.332 --> 20:46.065
Archer...
Um...

20:46.134 --> 20:48.635
Uh-huh.
Oh, what, what, Lana!

20:48.703 --> 20:50.603
Wait! No, there's
nothing in there.

20:50.672 --> 20:53.273
You call this nothing?

20:53.341 --> 20:54.808
Yeah, so...

20:54.876 --> 20:59.212
Because I call it smoochy-boochy town.
Uh-- hmm?

20:59.281 --> 21:01.748
Smooth jazz, rose petals,
candles--

21:01.783 --> 21:06.152
not sure what happened there, but
oh, my gosh! And Dom Pérignon?

21:06.221 --> 21:08.121
Which, I assume, was delicious.

21:08.190 --> 21:10.423
Uh, expensive fire extinguisher.

21:10.492 --> 21:13.059
Well, then go get a few more
bottles out of the fridge

21:13.128 --> 21:17.330
just to be safe, because
I am gonna burn you down!

21:19.167 --> 21:21.267
Back in a sec,

21:21.336 --> 21:23.236
new Archer...

21:23.305 --> 21:26.339
Yeah. I-I am new!
I am, Lana.

21:26.408 --> 21:28.508
I mean, I feel like
a brand new man!

21:28.577 --> 21:30.076
I've really changed!

21:30.145 --> 21:32.579
Really?
Ee-yah!

21:32.647 --> 21:35.315
Then why...

21:35.383 --> 21:38.685
is there a vagina in the sink!

21:38.753 --> 21:42.707
Um, so...
Funny story.
