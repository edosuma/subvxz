was involved in the robbery.

they chopped the money then and there,

12:07.521 --> 12:08.882
and then went their separate ways.

17:48.862 --> 17:51.448
But everybody thinks that they can do
whatever the hell they want

17:51.532 --> 17:54.118
with no repercussions whatsoever.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.828
And what is the point

17:55.911 --> 17:59.498
of being the only clean person
in a town that's completely dirty?

17:59.582 --> 18:02.918
When I'm dirty, my mom gives me a bath.

18:04.378 --> 18:08.591
Yeah. Well. that's what I'm doing.

18:10.009 --> 18:12.845
- I'm giving this town a bath.
- Bath time!

18:12.928 --> 18:17.474
(SIREN WAILING)

18:17.558 --> 18:21.020
- I thought you wasn't hungry.
- Oh, I'm starving.

18:21.103 --> 18:24.106
Then why didn't you eat
Mommy's breakfast?

18:24.189 --> 18:25.899
Because if I ate your mommy's breakfast,

18:25.983 --> 18:29.320
I'd end up a fat fucking bastard
like everybody else in this town.

18:33.324 --> 18:35.826
Let's just pretend Uncle Zeke
didn't say that, okay?

18:35.909 --> 18:38.746
- Okay.

18:40.539 --> 18:41.707
Hey, Sally.

18:43.042 --> 18:46.086
Do you mind if we drop her off at school
on the way to work?

18:46.170 --> 18:47.963
No, not at all.

18:48.047 --> 18:50.841
Get in the back, you fat fuckin' bastard.

the two remaining suspects

in the First Mackey Bank robbery.

Ed Burton and Andrew Sikes.

could not be reached for comment.

But it's now clear that Tuesday's
dramatic shoot-out at the FMB

20:43.662 --> 20:45.664
is anything but over.

Hey! Listen, you've got to come
and get this money out of here

20:53.547 --> 20:54.882
and give me that tape.

20:54.965 --> 20:57.760

21:06.059 --> 21:09.354
First, you send me to that motel.
Then, you stick me with this damn bag?

You. Hello? Hello?

21:14.443 --> 21:15.503
ZEKE: So, what's the story?

21:15.527 --> 21:18.906
Looks like our bank bandits had a dispute
over how to split the proceeds.

21:18.989 --> 21:21.450
Or never planned to split 'em
with this Morrow guy.

21:21.533 --> 21:23.285

21:25.037 --> 21:26.497
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.960
Your partner doesn't seem
too comfortable around bodies.

21:32.044 --> 21:35.130
Yeah, well, he knew the guy.

21:35.214 --> 21:36.799
You seem all right.

21:36.882 --> 21:39.301
- Yeah, well, I knew the guy.
- Meaning?

21:39.384 --> 21:43.347
Meaning. I'm not too surprised.
Chris was a little slow.

21:43.430 --> 21:46.141
Got his brain fried in a meth lab accident
a few years back.

21:46.225 --> 21:48.811
Same blow-up
that landed Ed Burton in the pen?

21:48.894 --> 21:50.187
That's the one.

But. there's something else.

22:04.535 --> 22:06.995
Andy was the prosecutor
in the case against Ed and Chris.

22:07.079 --> 22:10.165
Wait. Your brother
is the fucking prosecutor?

22:10.249 --> 22:11.708
He was.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.710
There was a pretty good scandal
after the trial

22:13.794 --> 22:15.714
on account of them
getting such a light sentence.

22:16.129 --> 22:17.130
Nobody proved anything,

22:17.214 --> 22:19.383
but there was a rumor going around
that Ed paid Andy

22:19.466 --> 22:21.426
to drop the reckless manslaughter charges.

22:21.510 --> 22:22.928
Wait, who got man-slaughtered?

22:23.011 --> 22:25.055
The file said he got rung up
on meth charges.

22:26.098 --> 22:28.809

Ed's son died in the blast.

22:36.149 --> 22:38.402
my brother got less
than ten percent of the vote.

- You think he took the money?
- No, I, um.

22:42.364 --> 22:44.825
Are you all right there?

22:44.908 --> 22:46.243
Yeah, I, uh.

22:46.326 --> 22:48.495
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

22:48.579 --> 22:53.083
Stephanie Burton called,
said that Ed came and went.

23:01.091 --> 23:03.468
So he just came back here
to get his clothes?

23:03.552 --> 23:07.472
- He wanted me to go with him.
- And you said no?

23:08.682 --> 23:11.518
- I said no.
- You expect us to believe that?

23:11.602 --> 23:14.855
Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash,
and you just tell him to get lost?

23:14.938 --> 23:19.359
Have you seen my face?
I called you, remember?

23:19.443 --> 23:22.321
Listen, we got a dead body in a county
that doesn't get dead bodies

23:22.404 --> 23:24.156
and a cop with a bullet hole in his arm.

23:24.239 --> 23:25.532
This is a big deal.

23:25.616 --> 23:28.994
So if it turns out that you're lying,
you will end up doin' time.

23:30.579 --> 23:31.580
How much time?

23:31.663 --> 23:33.665
Long enough for you to come out
a different person.

23:34.499 --> 23:36.185
Maybe you lose some
of those girlish good looks.

23:36.209 --> 23:38.045
Maybe you come out an old lady.

23:38.128 --> 23:40.368
- Hey, maybe you don't come out at all.
- (CLEAR THROAT)

23:42.049 --> 23:43.425
Steph, listen.

23:43.508 --> 23:47.512
- No, you listen. He'll kill me.
- Nobody is killing anybody.

23:47.596 --> 23:49.473
Tell that to Chris Morrow.

23:49.556 --> 23:51.266
Let me rephrase that.

23:51.350 --> 23:55.604
The best way for nobody else to get killed
is for you to tell us what you know.

24:03.195 --> 24:04.196
He's going to Mexico.

24:05.405 --> 24:07.206
He said he had one more thing
to take care of,

24:07.282 --> 24:09.451
but don't ask me what
because I don't know.

24:11.536 --> 24:13.830
Ed isn't much into discussing
business with me.

24:17.959 --> 24:19.586
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

24:19.670 --> 24:21.505
What do you think
that one more thing was?

24:21.588 --> 24:22.673
Could be Andy.

24:22.756 --> 24:26.426
- You don't think they're together?
- No, I never thought they were together.

24:26.510 --> 24:27.511
I think Ed was planning

24:27.594 --> 24:29.530
- to rip those guys off from moment one.
- (PHONE RINGING)

24:29.554 --> 24:31.348

24:31.431 --> 24:33.141
Sikes. Hang on a sec.

24:36.687 --> 24:39.439
- Where are you?
- Mexico. You should check it out.

24:39.523 --> 24:42.025
Drinks are a bit pricey,
but the beaches are amazing.

24:42.109 --> 24:43.151
Gosh, I'd really love to,

24:43.235 --> 24:46.697
but I'm kinda busy right now
hunting down my brother.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.990
Don't bother. I told you, I'm in Mexico.

24:49.908 --> 24:52.744
Jesus, Andy.
What the hell were you thinking?

24:52.828 --> 24:56.456
What was I thinking?
Look at me. My life is in ruins.

24:56.540 --> 25:00.001
I'm doing nothing but quickie divorces
and hawking life insurance.

25:00.085 --> 25:02.772
Yeah, maybe you should've thought of that
before you took Ed's money.

25:02.796 --> 25:05.757
I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.

25:05.841 --> 25:09.636
Really? After all that's happened,
you're still gonna lie to me?

25:11.304 --> 25:12.639
I don't know what to say.

25:12.723 --> 25:16.560
I want to you admit that Ed paid you
to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.

25:16.643 --> 25:20.814
I want you to admit you traded
a little boy's life for a fancy car.

25:20.897 --> 25:24.943
You make it sound so simple.
What about Judge Dawkins?

25:25.026 --> 25:26.987
Nobody cares
that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.

25:27.070 --> 25:29.865
We're not talking about Judge Dawkins.
We're talking about my brother.

25:29.948 --> 25:31.241
We're talking about you.

25:33.285 --> 25:34.411
Okay.

25:36.496 --> 25:37.622
Fine.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.543
Ed bought me off.

25:42.419 --> 25:45.797
Okay? You happy?

25:46.757 --> 25:49.509
Andy, you need to turn yourself in.

25:49.593 --> 25:50.510
(SCOFFS)

25:50.594 --> 25:53.305
Turn myself in? Are you kidding me?
With Chris dead?

25:53.388 --> 25:55.307
Now that's fucking felony-murder.

25:55.390 --> 25:58.643
Andy, I can't get you out of this.

25:59.895 --> 26:04.107
You either turn yourself in
or you face the consequences.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.416
- Where'd the Feds go?
- They went to check on a lead.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.710
The old barn. The Metcamp property.

26:23.794 --> 26:27.130
- Someone found Chris's Caddy.
- Really?

26:27.214 --> 26:29.508
I think we should have the Feds
camp out here tonight,

26:29.591 --> 26:30.842
keep an eye on Steph,

26:30.926 --> 26:33.303
in case Ed gets any bright ideas.

26:33.386 --> 26:36.139
- You know, two guys he doesn't recognize.
- That makes sense.

26:37.349 --> 26:40.727
- Hey, who was that? Martha?
- Yeah, sloppy Joes tonight.

26:42.020 --> 26:44.606
I love a sloppy Joe.

26:44.689 --> 26:50.028
Except, this morning, you told me
you were having fried chicken, Zeke.

26:50.111 --> 26:51.655
Who was that? Your brother?

26:54.866 --> 26:55.909
You really want to know?

26:57.077 --> 27:00.121
I just don't want you to get yourself
into something you can't get out of.

27:00.997 --> 27:02.767
(SCOFFS) Reed, how long
have we known each other?

27:02.791 --> 27:05.544
- That's not the point. Blood is blood.
- Exactly.

27:05.627 --> 27:08.922
So let's just leave it at that. Okay?

27:09.005 --> 27:10.674
All right, let's do it.

27:12.300 --> 27:13.468
So, what is it?

27:14.803 --> 27:17.556
- You having sloppy Joes or fried chicken?
- Who cares?

27:24.354 --> 27:27.816

Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

27:27.899 --> 27:31.236

that I'd never call you again

27:31.319 --> 27:34.698
but I just could use
a little company right now.

27:51.882 --> 27:54.676
A thousand dollars?
What, are you insane?

27:54.759 --> 27:57.721
Stop, stop! I know.
No, you're fine. You're right.

27:57.804 --> 28:00.974
A thousand dollars is right.
Just get over here.

That's awful kind of you to say.

and not small and weak like me.

with the little ones.

than anything that degenerate Ed
used to cook up.

29:51.209 --> 29:52.711
Ed is such a two-bit hustler.

29:52.794 --> 29:56.965
He used to cook his shit
with, like, MSM, Lexapro.

29:57.048 --> 29:59.175
You name it, he used it.

29:59.259 --> 30:00.302
But this stuff.

30:00.385 --> 30:04.639
I mean, for a thousand bucks,
I went straight to the magic man.

30:05.390 --> 30:06.808
Can I have a kiss?

30:14.816 --> 30:18.486
- I thought you were still mad at me.
- (SCOFFS)

30:18.570 --> 30:20.780
No, I was never mad at you.

30:20.864 --> 30:26.619
You were young, you needed money.
It's an opportunity. You took it.

30:26.703 --> 30:29.789
I was mostly mad at myself
for being so weak.

30:38.798 --> 30:40.800
- (STOMACH GRUMBLING)
- Oh.

30:40.884 --> 30:43.970
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:45.597 --> 30:47.349
I just gotta take a shit, that's all.

30:48.725 --> 30:51.186
- How romantic.
- Oh, sorry, honey.

30:51.269 --> 30:53.271
It's not you. It's the drugs.

30:53.355 --> 30:56.107
Sometimes, these things
just flush me right out.

(SIGHS)

31:03.323 --> 31:06.618
- Andy! What the hell are you doing here?
- I want the money.

31:06.701 --> 31:10.121
- (SHUTTERS) Why would I have the money?
- Don't you play fucking dumb with me!

31:10.205 --> 31:11.285
- I don't have it!
- Really?

31:11.331 --> 31:14.918
- You haven't seen Ed recently?
- I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

You should be afraid

46:41.593 --> 46:43.303
Good. You have a pen?

46:43.387 --> 46:46.724
- Where's Daddy?
- Oh, Daddy had to work late, sugarplum.

46:47.808 --> 46:50.060
I mean, you know,
this is all just a big mistake.

46:50.144 --> 46:53.105
Andy would never get involved
in anything like this.

46:54.189 --> 46:58.193
Martha, I saw him there
with my own two eyes.

46:58.277 --> 47:01.071
Well, your eyes deceived you,
plain and simple.

47:01.155 --> 47:06.535
- Oh, yeah? Then where the hell is Daddy?
- He's working late, goddamn it!

47:10.205 --> 47:13.667
I'm sorry. I know you're upset, too.

47:15.044 --> 47:19.214
- Hey, how's your shoulder?
- What happened to your shoulder?

47:20.632 --> 47:24.887
- I fell and bumped into a tree.
- That was pretty silly.

47:27.389 --> 47:30.726
Yeah, well. I'm a pretty silly guy.

47:35.814 --> 47:36.857
See ya!

47:38.067 --> 47:39.193
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

47:39.276 --> 47:41.528
Gracias, amigos.

47:41.612 --> 47:43.864
- Adiós.
- Peace.

47:43.947 --> 47:44.990
Adiós.

47:50.621 --> 47:52.790
- Chris!
- Steph?

47:52.873 --> 47:55.584
- Over here.
- Is that you?

47:55.667 --> 47:56.919
Hurry up!

47:58.837 --> 48:01.006
Hey, I made it!

48:06.804 --> 48:09.973
Is that. Is that what I think it is?

48:11.350 --> 48:12.851
Shit.

48:13.393 --> 48:17.064
- Chris, have you changed your clothes?
- Since when?

48:17.147 --> 48:21.235
- Since you robbed the bank?
- Oh, no.

48:21.318 --> 48:22.861
Here. Put on something of Ed's.

48:25.072 --> 48:26.824
Where is Ed anyway?

48:26.907 --> 48:29.618
He went to get a passport.
We're going to Mexico.

48:29.701 --> 48:32.871
- (SHOWER RUNNING)
- Oh, well, that's smart.

48:32.955 --> 48:34.957
Ed's a smart guy.

48:35.916 --> 48:38.794
Listen, do you mind
if I hop in the shower?

48:39.711 --> 48:41.880
You want to take a shower?

48:41.964 --> 48:43.423
Mm-hmm.

48:45.134 --> 48:46.134
Uh.

48:46.468 --> 48:48.387
Yeah. Okay.

49:01.483 --> 49:06.780
I always figured you sorta hated me
on account of what happened to Ed Jr.

49:09.408 --> 49:10.784
That was an accident.

49:13.996 --> 49:17.040
Put your gun down, Chris. Relax.

49:47.362 --> 49:48.572
Who the hell are you?

49:49.531 --> 49:52.075
You know who I am, son.
I'm Judge Dawkins.

49:52.159 --> 49:54.119
What the hell are you doing here?

49:54.203 --> 49:57.206
Well, Ed and Steph asked me to.

49:57.289 --> 49:59.333
Chris, don't trust him.

49:59.416 --> 50:01.543
Steph, what the hell's going on?

50:01.627 --> 50:04.296
Chris, if he takes the money,
we'll never see a penny of it.

50:04.379 --> 50:07.090
I don't want the money.
Steph, what the hell are you doing?

50:07.174 --> 50:09.885
Chris, he's lying.

50:09.968 --> 50:13.472
Hey, give me my gun back.
Give me back my gun!

50:13.555 --> 50:14.932
All right. Hold on, Chris.

50:15.015 --> 50:16.743
- We're gonna slow this down.
- Chris, don't trust him.

50:16.767 --> 50:18.578
Just give me the tape
and leave me out of this!

50:18.602 --> 50:19.853
No! Give me back my gun back!

50:19.937 --> 50:21.497
- We're gonna slow it down.
- Chris, he's lying.

50:21.521 --> 50:22.522
Don't do anything stupid.

50:22.606 --> 50:25.400
- Did you just call me stupid?
- Don't. Don't come further.

50:25.484 --> 50:26.610
'Cause I ain't stupid, okay?

50:26.693 --> 50:29.005
- All right, hold on.
- You people are always calling me names!

50:29.029 --> 50:30.590
- Don't come any further.
- But you don't know me!

50:30.614 --> 50:33.200
- I was smart once!
- I have a gun in my hand! Stop! I have.

50:43.835 --> 50:45.754
Jesus, Judge.

50:46.755 --> 50:51.051
I didn't. I didn't.
What have I. What have I done?

50:51.134 --> 50:52.636
You killed him.

50:52.719 --> 50:56.682
You provoked him!
Why did you provoke him?

50:56.765 --> 50:57.891
Just making sure.

50:59.226 --> 51:01.645
- You manipulative little sh.
- Focus, Judge.

51:01.728 --> 51:05.148
You just emptied a machine gun.
There's gonna be cops all over this place.

51:05.232 --> 51:08.819
- Ed. Where the fuck is Ed?
- Ed's keeping a low profile.

51:08.902 --> 51:11.280
There's way too much heat on him
to risk being seen.

51:11.363 --> 51:12.489
All right, where's my tape?

51:12.572 --> 51:14.574
We'll give it to you
when we come pick up the bag.

51:14.658 --> 51:16.743
No! I don't want the bag! I want the tape!

51:16.827 --> 51:20.330
We need you to hold on to the money for
a couple days until things cool off a bit.

51:20.414 --> 51:21.832
No, no, no. Just give me the tape.

51:21.915 --> 51:24.269
I'm gonna get out of here. I don't wanna
have anything to do with this.

51:24.293 --> 51:26.312
It's just a day or two,
and then this will all be over.

51:26.336 --> 51:30.382
No! This has gone too far.

51:30.465 --> 51:34.011
Just make sure your wife and kids
aren't around for a few days.

51:34.094 --> 51:37.681
'Cause we want to keep this thing
nice and simple, right?

51:39.099 --> 51:40.767
See you soon, Judge.

51:53.989 --> 51:55.741
Rudy's scrapyard at ten.

51:55.824 --> 51:58.118
(IMITATING CHRIS)
I got it. Okay. I'll see you there.

- Huh? Oh, nothing.

52:20.599 --> 52:22.601
Uh, go back to sleep, honey.

52:22.684 --> 52:27.189
- You're obviously doing something.
- It's a. It's a surprise.

52:28.940 --> 52:30.317
That'll be the day.

52:36.323 --> 52:39.326
- Are you all right, dear? You're shaking.
- Oh, I'm fine.

52:40.619 --> 52:43.163
You're not fine. You're shaking.

52:43.246 --> 52:44.706
Hey, listen,

52:44.790 --> 52:48.377
what do you say the four of us
go up to the cabin this weekend?

52:48.460 --> 52:49.645
We can spend the weekend up there.

52:49.669 --> 52:53.340
You can take the kids up there tomorrow,
and then get a head start on the clean-up.

52:53.423 --> 52:54.508
I see.

52:54.591 --> 52:55.967
You want to get rid of us

52:56.051 --> 52:58.929
so you can host
one of your big poker games.

52:59.012 --> 53:01.556
Uh, well, I guess you know me too well.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.933
(CRIES)

53:05.227 --> 53:08.438
Bradley, what's wrong?

53:10.023 --> 53:14.778
- What's happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

53:14.861 --> 53:16.696
Forget it.

53:19.032 --> 53:21.910
I love you, that's all. And, uh.

53:23.745 --> 53:24.788
I wish.

53:27.374 --> 53:30.085
I could be a better husband to you.

53:30.168 --> 53:36.091
It's just a poker game, dear.
You don't have to feel so guilty.

53:37.592 --> 53:40.804
Sometimes, boys just need
to be with other boys.

54:14.421 --> 54:17.132
- STEPH: You all right?
- I'm fine.

54:18.008 --> 54:20.802
- Big day today, huh?
- I suppose it is, yeah.

54:22.179 --> 54:23.472
I thought you'd be more excited.

54:25.015 --> 54:26.725
I don't know.

54:26.808 --> 54:29.686
When I was in prison, I told myself
that I'd be done with this life,

54:29.769 --> 54:31.771
get on the straight and narrow.

54:31.855 --> 54:34.441
Robbing banks
isn't exactly straight and narrow.

54:34.524 --> 54:36.651
Then why are you doing it?

54:38.945 --> 54:41.740
- That's a stupid fucking question.
- Why are you doing it?

54:43.366 --> 54:47.787
- For you.
- Bullshit. You're doing it for you.

54:49.414 --> 54:52.209
What are my options here, Steph, huh?

54:52.292 --> 54:56.254
Okay, we got no money.
We got no fucking opportunities.

54:57.547 --> 54:59.591
What are we supposed to do, huh?
You tell me, Steph.

54:59.674 --> 55:02.552
- What are we supposed to do?
- Nothing, I guess. I.

55:04.596 --> 55:07.474
I suppose this is just who you are.

55:10.894 --> 55:14.356
What the hell do you want from me, huh?

55:14.439 --> 55:17.567
For starters, you could accept
responsibility for my son's death.

55:17.651 --> 55:20.153
You are never gonna get over it, are you?

55:20.237 --> 55:23.990
Get over it? It's not a cold, Ed.

55:25.325 --> 55:29.162
- You don't think that I hurt, too?
- For what, eight months?

55:29.246 --> 55:33.333
I see! You wanted me to spend
ten years of my life in prison

55:33.416 --> 55:36.211
because of bad fucking luck?

55:36.294 --> 55:38.463
The school called us 'cause he was sick!

He had a stomachache
and I'm the one who answered!

- I was at work!
- So was I!

55:44.135 --> 55:47.806
At a drug lab! And you killed my son!

55:49.808 --> 55:52.477
You don't scare me, Ed.

55:52.561 --> 55:55.814
You only kill people by accident.

I got a football reunion.

56:21.256 --> 56:23.258
You're gonna miss
your daughter's dance recital

with a bunch of degenerates.

56:26.845 --> 56:28.513

He's gotta work at the bank.

Oh, well, if he can miss it,
then surely you can.

when they won.

56:35.562 --> 56:39.190
I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss
your thing tonight, but I have an idea.

56:39.274 --> 56:42.694
What about tomorrow you and me,
we go to Funland?

56:42.777 --> 56:44.029
She's got school tomorrow.

gang along. That's fine.

- There's no school.
- Damn it! What is the problem here?

- Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah. Westmoreland.

Reed's goal line play on fourth and one,

and I tossed a pretty little daisy

- right in your waiting mitt.
- It was perfect.

twice with the same tape.

01:00:39.472 --> 01:00:41.474
You can kickoff
whenever you're ready, man.

01:00:43.643 --> 01:00:45.478
You want me to take a shift tonight?

01:00:45.562 --> 01:00:49.190
Nah, nah. Bank duty is the sheriff's job.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:54.112
Dawkins will give me hell if it's not me
guarding his precious crop money.

01:00:54.195 --> 01:00:58.449
Plus, I don't want to ruin your night.
You seeing this mysterious Wendy again?

01:01:00.535 --> 01:01:03.913
Holy shit! You are.

01:01:04.747 --> 01:01:08.418
- Is it getting serious?
- No, it's just dinner.

01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:12.422
That's how it starts,
and then the next thing you know,

01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:14.424
little Wendys running
all around your house.

01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:15.507
Oh.

01:01:17.802 --> 01:01:19.554
I don't know, I don't know.

01:01:19.637 --> 01:01:21.055
- 602.
- 602.

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:22.974
- Not 206.
- 602.

01:01:23.057 --> 01:01:25.310
- I got it!
- All right.

01:01:27.854 --> 01:01:28.854
(SCOFFS)

01:01:29.355 --> 01:01:31.733
What? It ain't like one drink
never killed nobody.

01:01:31.816 --> 01:01:36.070
Chris, we need every brain cell you've got
left in your head tonight, okay?

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:38.698
Is. Is he making another stupid joke?

01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:41.576
- 'Cause I didn't get it!
- I'm not fucking around!

01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:43.995
- Hey, stop!
- Relax! Relax, okay?

01:01:44.078 --> 01:01:45.914
Everybody needs to chill the fuck out.

01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:48.875
That's what I'm trying to do.
This whole thing is freaking me out.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:52.295
Chris, Chris. Everything's gonna be fine.

01:01:52.378 --> 01:01:56.382
- Okay? Isn't that right, Andy?
- Five minutes. Easy in, easy out.

01:01:56.466 --> 01:01:57.985
You don't even have to leave your car.

01:01:58.009 --> 01:02:00.303
Yeah, well, why are we taking
my car anyway?

01:02:00.386 --> 01:02:02.472
Because everyone knows
I drive a bitchin' Camaro

01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:04.057
and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.202
No one has the slightest clue
as to what you drive. That's why.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.162
They probably think
that you don't even know how to drive.

01:02:08.186 --> 01:02:11.147
Of course, I fucking drive!
That's why I'm the goddamn driver.

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:14.025
Yeah, and Andy's the lookout,
and I'm the one handling the safe.

01:02:14.108 --> 01:02:16.945
And if we all just do our jobs,
then everything will be perfectly fine.

01:02:17.028 --> 01:02:20.406
Look, he's right, Chris.
My brother doesn't even lock the door.

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:22.700
I think he figures that the fact
that he's inside,

01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:25.078
no one is gonna try anything.
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:25.161 --> 01:02:30.166
Seriously, he must be the stupidest cop
in the history of the police force.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.543
- Hey, Ed, can I talk to you a sec?
- Yeah.

01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:36.306
You know, you really shouldn't talk
about your own brother like that.

01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:38.341
Shut up. Just shut up.

01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:41.051
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:43.388
(CHRIS AND ANDY TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:44.514
What's up?

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.184
I'm sorry about what happened
this morning.

01:02:49.352 --> 01:02:50.520
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

01:02:50.603 --> 01:02:52.480
That's a new one.

01:02:52.563 --> 01:02:56.818
Listen, I've. I've been thinking
about what you said.

01:02:58.069 --> 01:03:00.947
About how you thought
you'd left this life behind.

01:03:02.073 --> 01:03:03.157
Did you mean that?

01:03:06.619 --> 01:03:07.870
Yeah.

01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:10.039
Then you should call this whole thing off.

01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:13.043
Call this whole thing. What do you mean?
This whole thing was your idea.

01:03:14.335 --> 01:03:17.630
Chris, Andy, Dawkins. You said
they'd all play ball and they fucking did.

01:03:19.007 --> 01:03:20.508
Ed, I'm serious.

01:03:21.926 --> 01:03:23.469
It's not too late.

01:03:27.682 --> 01:03:32.061
(CLEAR THROAT)
Don't get skittish on me now, all right?

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:34.605
We got this. Trust me.

01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:36.709
You're gonna be singing
a very different tune in a few hours

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.943
when you're a very rich woman.

01:03:49.954 --> 01:03:52.081
All right, where were we, boys?

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:53.583
(TAPS ON TABLE)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:04:09.098 --> 01:04:12.935
- Evening, fellas.
- Oh, Sheriff Sikes, my man!

01:04:13.019 --> 01:04:16.272
Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am
that you're going to all this trouble

01:04:16.356 --> 01:04:17.648
to help us out once again.

01:04:17.732 --> 01:04:19.609
Really, it is no trouble at all.

01:04:19.692 --> 01:04:21.527
Great. Well, same procedure as usual.

01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:24.906
Uh, the cash will spend the night in here.
In the morning, we'll take it out,

01:04:24.989 --> 01:04:27.950
divvy it out to the other branches
to be paid out to the farmers

01:04:28.034 --> 01:04:29.494
when they come to cash their checks.

01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:32.330
That'll be going on for a few days.
Hold on one second.

01:04:33.998 --> 01:04:35.124
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:38.252
Thank you, my man. Thank you.

01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:43.716
So, uh, unless there's anything else,
I'm just gonna be heading home.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.969
I gotta get home
before Allison pitches a fit.

01:04:47.053 --> 01:04:50.306
I gotta be there
right when dinner is served.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:53.142
Judge, uh. you wanna.

01:04:54.268 --> 01:04:56.437
Oh! Yeah, sorry.

01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:58.106
(CHUCKLES)

01:04:59.065 --> 01:05:02.318
Hey, listen, just as a point of curiosity,

01:05:02.402 --> 01:05:05.530
what would happen if someone
tried to rob this bank tonight?

01:05:05.613 --> 01:05:06.823
You'd shoot 'em, right?

01:05:08.157 --> 01:05:10.159
Well, that sort of depends
on the situation.

01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:14.789
Ideally, I'd like to arrest them
without resorting to violence.

01:05:14.872 --> 01:05:18.167
Well, shoot first, ask questions later.
That's what I always say.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.545
Know what I mean?

01:05:22.338 --> 01:05:24.715
Um, not really, no.

01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:32.014
Just know that if anything like that
were ever to happen,

01:05:32.098 --> 01:05:34.183
I'd have your back a hundred percent.

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:38.354
I mean, no matter what the circumstances.

01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:41.830
That's awfully kind of you to say, Judge.

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:47.280
Though, hopefully, tonight will just be
your typical quiet night at the bank.

01:05:48.865 --> 01:05:53.870
Of course. Okay. Well, I hope
you brought a crossword puzzle.

You move one muscle and I'll blow
your fucking brains all over the wall!

01:07:01.354 --> 01:07:03.231
Okay, get his gun.

01:07:04.398 --> 01:07:06.901
You. You get his gun. You get his.

01:07:06.984 --> 01:07:12.031

Okay. Now, go. Destroy it!

- I can't!
- Cuff yourself!

- I am!

Let me guess. Step two: Unlock vault.

01:08:06.002 --> 01:08:08.963
Shut the fuck up!
Or I'll shoot you in the face!

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:13.134
Hey, what's happening?

01:08:13.217 --> 01:08:15.970
What the fuck do you think is happening?
We're robbing a bank.

01:08:16.053 --> 01:08:17.888
I know, but inside, is it going good?

01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:23.269
Yeah, Chris.
It's going real good. Super good.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.063
Okay.

01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:43.080
Fuck! Come on!

How many times you gonna spin that dial?

- Shut up or I'll shoot you.
- In the face. I get it, I get it.

01:08:51.714 --> 01:08:54.634
- Do you mind if I finish my dinner?
- Will you just shut the fuck up?

01:09:02.725 --> 01:09:04.060
Fuck!

01:09:06.062 --> 01:09:09.899
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Get back!

01:09:09.982 --> 01:09:11.692
- Just a second.
- Get back! Stay back!

01:09:11.776 --> 01:09:13.152
Stay back! I'll shoot!

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:16.988
What are you.? Go back! Go back!
What are you doing?

What the fuck are you doing?
What are you.?

01:09:19.992 --> 01:09:21.872

You think I care about the money?

It's all federally insured anyway.

You.? You don't care
if I take the money?

- I'm not Ed! I'm Doug!

Arnold's less successful. brother.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:41.389
Fuck it! All right. Yeah, it's me!
I'm gonna be long gone,

01:09:41.471 --> 01:09:44.642
anyway, by the time they get you
out of that fucking vault.

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:46.644
Huh? So, here. Good luck.

01:09:51.941 --> 01:09:54.026
It's 86.

01:09:57.363 --> 01:10:01.200
How do you read that
as a fucking eight, huh?

01:10:01.283 --> 01:10:06.163
Six, 28, 86. It's his.
It's his fucking wedding anniversary.

(SCOFFS) Yeah.

with my mask off. Okay.

Yeah! Whoo!

01:10:28.227 --> 01:10:30.855
Hey, Andy,
you think when this is all over,

01:10:30.938 --> 01:10:32.982
things will go back
to the way they were before?

01:10:33.774 --> 01:10:35.651
I sure as fuck hope not.

01:10:35.735 --> 01:10:39.155
No, I mean, like, before everything.

01:10:39.238 --> 01:10:41.031
Like, Ed Jr.

01:10:44.118 --> 01:10:46.746
It'll never be like it was before Ed Jr.

01:10:46.829 --> 01:10:52.835
Yeah. I guess people
really don't like dead kids, huh?

01:10:52.918 --> 01:10:57.131
Yeah, no shit. They fucking love 'em.

01:10:57.214 --> 01:10:59.800
We had some pretty good times
back in the day.

01:10:59.884 --> 01:11:04.555
You and me. But now, 'cause of tonight.

01:11:07.308 --> 01:11:08.768
I'll probably never see you again.

01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:13.814
I guess that means
you're not planning on shootin' me.

01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:20.237
Come on, Z, you think I'm actually capable
of doing something like that?

01:11:20.321 --> 01:11:21.655
Jesus Christ.

01:11:22.698 --> 01:11:26.702
I don't know.
You killed Ed Jr. pretty good.

(CLEAR THROAT) Excuse me?

01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:33.417
You heard me.

01:11:34.627 --> 01:11:39.757
- That was a fucking accident, Zeke.
- Hey, shit happens.

01:11:43.719 --> 01:11:45.763
Fuck you, Zeke!

01:11:45.846 --> 01:11:48.224
You sound like my goddamn wife.

01:11:51.977 --> 01:11:53.771
Hey. Here.

01:11:55.314 --> 01:11:58.526
Get in the fucking vault!
Get in the fucking vault, Zeke!

01:12:00.152 --> 01:12:01.946
And if I suffocate in there
before morning,

01:12:02.029 --> 01:12:05.032
I guess that'll be an accident too, right?

01:12:05.115 --> 01:12:08.285
Do you want me to kill you?
'Cause I can fucking do that!

01:12:08.369 --> 01:12:10.246
You know what they say.

01:12:10.329 --> 01:12:12.832
Once you take a life,
it's always easier the second time.

01:12:17.419 --> 01:12:21.131
I could kill you.
I am on the edge right now.

01:12:22.716 --> 01:12:24.927
I'll fucking do it!

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:30.099
Fuck! Do not fucking push me, Zeke!

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:32.852
Or what?

01:12:33.644 --> 01:12:35.062
Or I'll.

01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:39.108
(GROANING, BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.282
Oh, shit!

01:12:47.575 --> 01:12:50.828
What the fuck?
What the fuck is happening, man?

01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:53.956
What's happening?

01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:57.543
You're robbing a bank, Ed.

01:12:57.626 --> 01:13:00.254
And pretty soon, you're gonna shoot me,

01:13:00.337 --> 01:13:02.298
and then race out that door
with the money.

01:13:03.632 --> 01:13:06.010
But first, you'll kill Chris.
Maybe Dawkins.

01:13:06.093 --> 01:13:08.989
But probably Chris, then Dawkins.
And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy.

01:13:09.013 --> 01:13:10.264
What?

01:13:10.347 --> 01:13:12.474
And then,
once all your loose ends are tied up,

01:13:12.558 --> 01:13:15.238
you're gonna disappear with the money,
never to be heard from again.

01:13:16.103 --> 01:13:19.732
Except. none of that's gonna happen

01:13:19.815 --> 01:13:21.358
'cause I'm gonna kill you.

01:13:21.442 --> 01:13:24.403
and I'm gonna bury you in a hole
out by Shimmer Lake.

01:13:24.486 --> 01:13:29.241
What? Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this, Zeke?

01:13:29.783 --> 01:13:31.076
What the fuck?

01:13:33.245 --> 01:13:37.541
Shit, what's happening?
What the fuck is going on?

01:13:39.043 --> 01:13:42.379
- Justice, Ed.
- Justice. Justice for what?

01:13:42.463 --> 01:13:45.174
We couldn't just let you get away with it.

01:13:45.257 --> 01:13:49.386
Not you. Not Chris Morrow.
Not Andy Sikes.

01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:51.180
Not Brad Dawkins.

01:13:52.765 --> 01:13:56.143
He wasn't dead two weeks
and you were already cutting a deal.

01:13:56.852 --> 01:13:58.771
You stole him from us.

01:13:59.939 --> 01:14:01.690
You stole my baby.

01:14:01.774 --> 01:14:04.568
Oh, come on. Come on.

01:14:04.652 --> 01:14:07.655
He was my baby too, okay?

01:14:08.989 --> 01:14:10.616
Don't you get it?

01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:16.163
He wasn't your baby.

01:14:16.246 --> 01:14:19.375
What are you talking about?
Stop saying that.

01:14:19.458 --> 01:14:20.668
Ed.

01:14:25.673 --> 01:14:29.635
Do you remember
back when we were all so close?

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:33.514
Steph and I made a mistake.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.641
No.

01:14:37.142 --> 01:14:39.853
I stayed with you
because I still loved you.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.985
And I hoped seeing that beautiful boy
could have straightened us out,

01:14:46.068 --> 01:14:48.362
could have. could have saved us.

01:14:49.697 --> 01:14:51.573
Then you killed him.

01:14:53.993 --> 01:14:55.703
It was an accident.

01:14:58.414 --> 01:15:00.249
It was an accident.

01:15:03.752 --> 01:15:04.753
Zeke.

01:15:04.837 --> 01:15:07.423
We thought we were doing the right thing.

01:15:08.716 --> 01:15:09.967
We thought you'd changed.

01:15:12.386 --> 01:15:14.388
He was my son, Ed.

01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:27.818
I'm sorry.

01:15:27.901 --> 01:15:29.695
Yeah.

01:15:31.238 --> 01:15:32.239
I'm sorry, too.

01:15:38.412 --> 01:15:39.580
I'm going in.

01:15:39.663 --> 01:15:41.290
- The fuck you are!
- I'm going in there!

01:15:41.373 --> 01:15:43.375
No! No, Chris, you're the driver.

01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:45.145
You get back in the driver's seat
right now.

01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:47.212
For all we know,
those could've been warning shots.

01:15:47.296 --> 01:15:48.922
- Warning shots?
- Yes.

01:15:49.006 --> 01:15:51.008
- What the fuck?
- No, Chris! No!

01:15:54.053 --> 01:15:55.304
(EXHALES)

01:16:01.894 --> 01:16:04.521
- This is really happening, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:16:05.564 --> 01:16:08.692
- Zeke, this is really happening.
- Yes.

01:16:09.943 --> 01:16:13.155
Okay. Are you ready?

01:16:14.073 --> 01:16:15.824
Here.

01:16:21.288 --> 01:16:23.916
Relax. Breathe.

01:16:29.379 --> 01:16:32.007
- Does it hurt?
- No, I don't feel a thing.

01:16:32.091 --> 01:16:36.053
All right, give me the pistol
and get the tarp.

01:16:41.016 --> 01:16:43.769
Oh, shit! Fuck! Go!

01:16:43.852 --> 01:16:45.771
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:16:45.854 --> 01:16:49.066
Fuck! Chris, fuck, it's Zeke!
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:50.484
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:17:29.439 --> 01:17:30.816
(STARTS ENGINE)

01:18:17.821 --> 01:18:20.115
(ALARM RINGING)

01:18:33.587 --> 01:18:35.964
- Why? Why?
- (STAMMERING) I'm sorry, Andy.

01:18:36.048 --> 01:18:38.300
- I fucked up.
- (VEHICLE DOOR OPENS)

01:18:38.383 --> 01:18:40.427
Oh, fuck. We're fucked, Andy.

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:42.030
- We're fucked.
- (VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES)

01:18:45.515 --> 01:18:46.600

- (ALARM RINGING)

01:18:55.317 --> 01:18:57.694
- Zeke?
- Back here!

01:18:59.863 --> 01:19:00.864
Oh, shit!

01:19:00.948 --> 01:19:02.366
(ENGINE RUNNING)

01:19:05.244 --> 01:19:06.411
(ENGINE STOPS)

01:19:06.495 --> 01:19:08.580
- (STEPH GRUNTING)
- (BANGING)

01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:17.798
(MAN ON A POLICE RADIO)
019. Come in.

01:19:17.881 --> 01:19:20.759
- Shit! Oh, shit! Fuck!
- OFFICER: This is 019.

01:19:20.842 --> 01:19:24.054
We got an alarm signal
coming from First Mackey Bank.

01:19:25.389 --> 01:19:29.518
- I'm gonna shoot him.
- What? No! Get the. You stupid.

01:19:29.601 --> 01:19:31.019
OFFICER: Chris Morrow.

01:19:33.563 --> 01:19:37.359
- It's your lucky day.
- Really?

01:19:37.442 --> 01:19:39.903
- Ed Burton shot you?
- Yeah.

01:19:39.987 --> 01:19:42.114
Ed shot me.

01:19:42.197 --> 01:19:44.074
Then he took off out back with the money,

01:19:44.157 --> 01:19:47.577
and two others took off out front
in a blue Caddy.

01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:50.330
I took some shots at 'em,
but I just got too woozy.

01:19:50.414 --> 01:19:52.457
I had to come back in and lie down.

01:19:52.541 --> 01:19:56.044
Hi, I need an ambulance and, uh, cops.
I need. I need a lot of cops.

01:20:03.176 --> 01:20:04.177
(GRUNTS)

01:20:07.556 --> 01:20:09.993
It's just something to numb the pain
before we take you to the hospital.

01:20:10.017 --> 01:20:13.770
- No, no, I can't. I'm allergic.
- You have to have something.

01:20:13.854 --> 01:20:15.439
Trust me, I'll be fine.

01:20:16.565 --> 01:20:18.165
REED:
He says it was Ed Burton for sure.

01:20:18.191 --> 01:20:22.946
He couldn't make out any other faces.
He did say they sped off in a blue Caddy.

01:20:25.032 --> 01:20:26.283
What?

01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:36.293
Thank you.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.092
What's going on?
Um.

01:20:44.176 --> 01:20:45.611
I was just talking to Pete and Luke,

01:20:45.635 --> 01:20:50.182
and not five minutes ago, they pulled
over a Caddy for excessive speeding.

01:20:51.058 --> 01:20:52.184
And?

01:20:53.894 --> 01:20:55.228
It was your brother.

01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:15.123
- Man, Zeke. This is a real mess.
- Yeah, it's an old mess.

01:21:15.207 --> 01:21:17.000
How do you mean?

01:21:17.084 --> 01:21:23.173
I mean, this is what happens
when wrongs go unrighted. They fester.

01:21:23.256 --> 01:21:24.883
You talking about Ed Jr.?

01:21:24.966 --> 01:21:28.762
Yeah, you're damn fucking right
I'm talking about Ed Jr.

01:21:28.845 --> 01:21:31.681
Eight lousy months he got.

01:21:31.765 --> 01:21:33.725
Don't worry about it. We'll get him.

01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:36.728
I'm not worried about it, Reed.

01:21:38.814 --> 01:21:40.565
As far as I'm concerned.

01:21:42.484 --> 01:21:43.777
he's already got.
