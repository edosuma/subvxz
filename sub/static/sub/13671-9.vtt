WEBVTT

01:35.440 --> 01:38.080
 Where did you go?

01:38.080 --> 01:42.080
 Come here.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.440
 Almost.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.560
 Just missed that time.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.639
 Got you.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.520
 Wow.

02:10.520 --> 02:14.520
  BEEPER GOES OFFF

02:32.080 --> 02:34.320
 Boy, Donald.
 You take the cake.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.120
 Sorry. Last slice.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.000
 I'm talking about
 you slogging over
 those DRGs.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
 I promised myself
 I'd get out from under
 DRGs, staffing reports.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.760
 But here you are,

02:44.760 --> 02:48.400
 St. Eligius's
 ever-capable
 desk jockey.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.800
 It's not
 a title I relish.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.640
 It's taking
 my focus as a doctor

02:53.640 --> 02:55.080
 away from
 the patients.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.440
 At least you're
 still succeeding as
 director of medicine.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.760
 I'll never catch up.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.640
 I've spent
 almost three months

03:01.640 --> 03:03.640
 trying to
 rehabilitate this hand.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.440
 Had partial return
 of fine motor control,

03:06.440 --> 03:08.680
 but whenever
 I move the fingers,

03:08.680 --> 03:12.680
 I'm peppered with pain.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.560
 At least I can slice
 my own meat again.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.360
 I used to be one of
 the state's saltiest
 cardiac surgeons.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.240
 Then I lost my temper,
 shattered a picture.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.200
 Foolish.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.120
 Now I'm
 paying the price.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.200
 We're both
 at a crossroads.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.760
 Or the end
 of the line.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.760
 What is this,
 pressed ham?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.960
 I'm getting worse.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.720
 - This is serious.
 - A broken rib?

03:38.720 --> 03:41.760
 My one-gun salute
 for Lucy.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.040
 Do something.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.520
 I'll explain
 my feelings.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.400
 About me!
 I can't breathe.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.320
 A nerve block
 might help.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.240
 Victor!

03:50.240 --> 03:54.120
 I didn't call
 for a fair catch.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.040
 You rang?

03:55.040 --> 03:56.960
 Boomer panicked
 and beeped you.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.360
 I didn't panic.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.800
 Your hair
 was uncurling.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.200
 I needed somebody.
 You're too distracted.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.600
 Fiscus doesn't
 get rattled
 in emergencies.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.520
 A tension pneumo.
 Got a Heimlich valve?

04:07.520 --> 04:08.960
 Take it easy.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.920
 No valves.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.360
 I'll use a needle.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.560
 Don't pin this
 on me.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.200
 You've just moaned
 about Lucy.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.120
 Needle.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.079
 There.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.760
 Slow deep breath.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.160
 Start a chest tube.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.400
 So, Lucy's a moaner?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.320
 Will this leave a scar?

04:32.320 --> 04:33.280
 Well...

04:33.280 --> 04:34.720
 I knew it.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.120
 Spouses can do that.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.040
 Last time, Judy
 threw a steam iron.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.440
 You can almost read
 Hamilton Beach.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.840
 I left, but
 she kept calling,

04:43.840 --> 04:45.720
 crying, asking
 for another chance.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.680
 I'm tired of
 Judy's punching.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.160
 I told her
 we're kaput.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.160
 You two ever
 tried counselling?

04:53.160 --> 04:56.280
 Judy lets her crockery
 do the talking.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.200
 I don't know
 what the big deal is
 with her about monogamy.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.600
 This is the eighties.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.480
 All my kids know
 they got a dad.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.760
 How many children?

05:05.760 --> 05:06.960
 By her? A couple.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.440
 When Judy's
 not in the mood,

05:11.480 --> 05:14.240
 You could at least
 use birth control.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.640
 Oh, ribbies
 don't feel right.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.920
 Which reminds me.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.160
 Can you give me
 some penicillin?

05:20.160 --> 05:22.880
 I thought welfare
 was an ugly issue...

05:22.880 --> 05:24.720
 You remind me of someone.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.240
 Who?

05:26.240 --> 05:27.200
 Clark Gable?

05:27.200 --> 05:31.200
 My soon-to-be-
 ex-husband.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.760
 Is that so?

05:32.760 --> 05:34.760
 If everything
 turns out OK,

05:34.760 --> 05:37.760
 are you a player?

05:37.760 --> 05:41.760
 Ow!

05:42.040 --> 05:43.960
 I thought
 it was a pneumo.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.560
 Stop doubting
 yourself.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.480
 You've got good
 medical sense.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.360
 Next time
 I'll beep you
 before Ehrlich.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.280
 So, I'm
 out of sorts.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.240
 I'm addicted.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.960
 For three years,
 you and Lucy fought.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.920
 Good fighting.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.320
 You get drunk
 at a party,

05:59.320 --> 06:00.760
 jump into bed,

06:00.760 --> 06:02.200
 now you're in heat.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.120
 Yes, that's
 how I feel.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.080
 She knows?

06:05.080 --> 06:06.520
 Are you crazy?

06:06.520 --> 06:07.960
 After a 16-day
 marriage,

06:07.960 --> 06:10.360
 l-o-v-e is out
 of my vocabulary.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.760
 Lucy made it clear

06:11.760 --> 06:14.680
 she wanted nothing
 to do with me.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.000
 Who'd blame her?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.880
 Toodle-oo, guys.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.760
 Maybe the problem with
 our lack of relationship

06:23.760 --> 06:25.080
 is the habitat.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.880
 We should get away
 from sterile hospitals.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.360
 Maybe a romantic holiday.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.200
 Do you think
 she'd like the Cape
 or Martha's Vineyard?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.160
 Either.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.120
 Which?

06:35.120 --> 06:37.000
 Vineyard's got
 the ferry ride.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.920
 But it's a
 scenic drive
 to P-Town.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.400
 Some people
 like islands,
 some peninsulas.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.320
 Swell. Next we'll spend
 Christmas in the isthmus.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.240
 I go for
 the merry-go-round
 at Oak Bluffs.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.680
 On the other hand--

06:49.680 --> 06:51.080
 Boomer. Never mind.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.080
 Let's do
 the last roundup.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.840
 Everything I've
 done since age 5

07:01.840 --> 07:04.240
 was directed toward
 being a physician.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.920
 If I can't
 cure people,
 what's the point?

07:06.920 --> 07:10.640
 Someone like that.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.000
 Next generation.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.280
 We're working on
 passing the torch,

07:14.280 --> 07:16.040
 sharing what
 we've learned.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.320
 Fiscus?

07:17.320 --> 07:19.960
 Someone must have
 tampered with
 your ratatouille.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.280
 He's the best
 resident we have.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.440
 He's a little
 on the fringe,

07:24.440 --> 07:25.480
 I grant you that,

07:25.480 --> 07:28.200
 but he can handle trauma
 better than anyone.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.000
 Not better than
 Maury Davis.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.400
 Remember,
 resident in '78?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.840
 Yeah, I do.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.680
 Where is he
 practising now?

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
 L.A.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.880
 Law.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.640
 Really.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.480
 If it was yours
 to do over again,

07:41.480 --> 07:42.880
 what would you do?

07:42.880 --> 07:43.880
 Oof.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.480
 I would have
 had the chicken.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.800
 I hate you.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.440
 If I dwell on
 what might have been,

07:50.440 --> 07:51.560
 I'd go crazy.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.200
 The important thing is
 doing all you can,

07:54.200 --> 07:57.320
 living with limitations,
 adapting.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.480
 Hand me one
 of those DRGs.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.480
 Why?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.720
 Because the napkin
 dispenser is empty.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.160
 You don't want
 these things.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.160
 We can do this
 claptrap together.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.080
 Make fun of me
 if you want,

08:14.080 --> 08:17.440
 but my life
 is anchored in
 family and friends.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.360
 Things will look
 brighter tomorrow.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.760
 You've got the great
 bedside manner.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.160
 You have problems
 relating to everybody,

08:24.160 --> 08:25.080
 co-workers,
 patients...

08:25.080 --> 08:26.040
 Yeah, yeah.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.480
 Good night,
 Mr. Phillips.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.840
 You got to be willing
 to bare your emotions.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.280
 Open yourself up.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.720
 OK, I'll try.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.280
 Nighty-night,
 Mrs. Esaki.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.520
 Buzz off!

08:38.520 --> 08:39.480
 Whoa.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.919
 That settles it.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.760
 My trip
 with Lucy's off.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.320
 Next case.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.520
 Patient with acute
 colicystitus stayed
 three weeks.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.560
 Medicare will
 reimburse us
 for seven days.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.600
 Seven days
 is appropriate

08:56.600 --> 08:58.640
 in a case
 without complications.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.040
 But this poor man
 developed phlebitis.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.880
 Now you see some
 of the catch-22S
 I'm up against.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.280
 You're not playing
 the game right.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.520
 Where is Daniel
 while we're working?

09:09.520 --> 09:10.800
 There's no
 strategy here.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.000
 We can only
 review the case,
 submit the claim,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.360
 ask for payment,
 and hope we cover
 our costs.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.800
 The hell that's all.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.480
 First, we take
 our eraser...

09:22.480 --> 09:26.480
 make a small
 diagnostic adjustment...

09:26.640 --> 09:29.840
 and list the ailment
 as colistatic jaundice.

09:29.840 --> 09:30.800
 That way,

09:30.800 --> 09:33.160
 the patient gets
 the proper treatment,

09:33.160 --> 09:35.880
 and St. Eligius
 gets its money.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.280
 And you and I get
 10 to 15 years for fraud.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.200
 Good point.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.680
 I'll sign
 Daniel's name.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.080
 When they catch us,

09:44.080 --> 09:47.880
 he'll be in an urn
 on Katharine's
 mantlepiece.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.160
 Hey, buddy!

09:49.160 --> 09:51.560
 Where did you
 used to work?

09:51.560 --> 09:55.560
 The lobby
 of the Schubert?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.520
 When the nurse finishes,
 you're on your way.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.480
 Wrist, huh?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.400
 Hi, Jackie.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.840
 What took so long?

10:04.840 --> 10:06.280
 It was 15 minutes.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.360
 So I get to
 take up the slack?

10:09.360 --> 10:11.360
 You said it was OK.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.280
 I give enough without
 your caseload and mine.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.160
 No wonder
 my marriage failed.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.080
 I'm always here
 treating low-lifes.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.520
 Pen still writes.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.920
 You can skate
 on this baby.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.360
 I'll help you.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.840
 I hate medicine.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.280
 Where have you been?

10:26.280 --> 10:27.680
 Across the street.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.040
 After dark?
 Pretty gutsy.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.160
 It was worth
 the risk.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.440
 You've been
 catching fireflies?

10:34.440 --> 10:35.880
 I only got one.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.240
 Not as fast
 as I was,

10:38.240 --> 10:40.120
 but I'll
 try for more.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.040
 Forgot what
 it felt like
 to catch them,

10:43.040 --> 10:45.440
 hold them trapped
 inside your hand.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.320
 Total control
 over their lives.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.600
 You could
 squash them,
 release them,

10:49.600 --> 10:51.360
 keep them in a jar.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.320
 Put my wife
 in a can.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.480
 You want to talk
 about love, Sydney?

10:56.480 --> 11:00.480
 I'll show you love.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.080
 What's wrong
 with you?

11:06.080 --> 11:09.160
 Wayne.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.160
 Wayne.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.720
 - You killed him!
 - Let's get out of here.

11:16.720 --> 11:20.720
 Oh, my God.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.720
 Call the code.
 Get the dressings.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.720
 Sorry.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.600
 Jackie,
 don't let me die.

11:32.600 --> 11:36.600
 Let's get some
 help down here.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.800
 Toto,
 I have a feeling

13:27.800 --> 13:31.800
 we're not
 in Boston anymore.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.520
 Dr. Fiscus,
 that you?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.960
 No.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.320
 Mon ami.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.080
 Wayne, it is I,

14:17.080 --> 14:19.840
 your comrade,
 Rockin' Ralph.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.560
 Seem a little
 frazzled, Dr. Fiscus.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.160
 I get this way
 whenever I see
 dead former patients.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.120
 How nice
 to be remembered.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.760
 I went face down

14:28.760 --> 14:31.680
 in the middle
 of my vaudeville routine -

14:31.680 --> 14:33.360
 the Murray Robin
 Comedy Workshop.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.120
 Sorry I made
 Elliot slobber.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.600
 Well, uh...

14:36.600 --> 14:37.960
 nice boy.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.720
 You had less
 distance to fall.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.560
 I did a Louganis off
 the hospital roof.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.760
 Thought you
 were an eagle?

14:45.760 --> 14:49.760
 But if you're both dead,
 what are you doing here?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.400
 What am I
 doing here?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.520
 Burning off that
 extra pound of sin.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.200
 Where the hell
 are we?

14:57.200 --> 15:00.320
 Close,
 but you're warm.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.920
 Ha ha ha!

15:01.920 --> 15:03.720
 Oh, I'm starting
 to spit.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.640
 Will you pass me
 the cocoa butter?

15:05.640 --> 15:07.080
 Mi amigo,

15:07.080 --> 15:09.760
 different people
 call this place
 different things -

15:09.760 --> 15:12.320
 valley of
 the shadow of death,

15:12.320 --> 15:13.920
 purgatory,

15:13.920 --> 15:15.320
 limbo.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.320
 How low
 can you go?

15:19.840 --> 15:23.520
 STEEL BANKD PLAYS

15:23.520 --> 15:25.720
 I'm dead?

15:25.720 --> 15:29.720
 Dr. Wayne Fiscus,
 this is your afterlife.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.480
 This must
 be a mistake.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.040
 I know it's hard,

15:34.040 --> 15:38.040
 so devastatingly
 hard to comprehend
 your own mortality.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.120
 So order a chi-chi,
 grab a chair,

15:41.120 --> 15:44.920
 and sun those buns.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.640
 I...I,
 I can't be dead.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.080
 I, uh...

15:49.080 --> 15:53.080
 I feel great.

15:53.080 --> 15:57.080
 Feel real good.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.720
 Ok, let's lift him.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.680
 Bullet must have
 hit the heart.

16:24.680 --> 16:25.800
 He's dead.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.080
 Oh, God.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.960
 OK. He's
 going to be OK.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.360
 Chest tube,
 thoracotomy tray,

16:31.360 --> 16:33.760
 central venous
 catheter, stat.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.280
 Start a second line.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.160
 D-5 lactated
 ringers in both.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.680
 And an
 intubation tray.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.920
 Better be good.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.440
 I was half-way
 out the door.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.880
 It's Wayne.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.400
 My God.
 Wayne, buddy.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.640
 Chest trauma
 from a gunshot.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.920
 Entry's lateral
 to the sternum.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.680
 No pulse,
 no respiration.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.720
 Starting
 compressions.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.000
 There's a lot
 of bleeding.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.960
 Wayne's O-negative.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.640
 He told me when
 we were tested for VD.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.440
 Get six units
 down here, stat.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.240
 Call O.R.
 find an attending.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.480
 Jackie,
 what happened?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.160
 Lady came in
 gunning for her
 scuzzbag husband,

17:05.160 --> 17:07.200
 got Wayne instead.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.720
  BEEP

17:08.720 --> 17:10.280
 No breath sounds.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.160
 Must be blood
 in the chest.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.680
 Let's open him up.

17:13.680 --> 17:17.680
 Who wants to do it?

17:51.040 --> 17:52.520
 Aren't you
 Eve Leighton?

17:52.520 --> 17:54.400
 Oh, hello, Wayne.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.320
 Children, this
 is Dr. Fiscus.

17:56.320 --> 18:00.320
 Remember when I
 had my heart transplant?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.320
 Eve, where am I?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.360
 Heaven.
 You're in heaven.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.920
 This isn't the time
 for "let's pretend."

18:06.920 --> 18:08.320
 She's telling
 the truth.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.960
 That's all
 we do here.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.160
 Doctor, could you
 have helped us.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.440
 Smallpox went
 through our wagon train.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.120
 My folks
 are here, too.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.360
 I don't know
 what's going on.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.800
 First I get shot,

18:19.800 --> 18:21.720
 then I walk
 down a hall,

18:21.720 --> 18:23.680
 I take a wrong turn

18:23.680 --> 18:25.560
 and wind up
 in the desert.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.560
 And now, I'm
 here in, uh...

18:29.600 --> 18:32.720
 you children run ahead
 to the merry-go-round.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.080
 I'll be there
 in a moment.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.120
 All right!

18:36.120 --> 18:40.120
 Marie,
 wait for us.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.720
 If this is heaven,

18:44.720 --> 18:47.480
 why isn't everyone
 jumping around
 on clouds,

18:47.480 --> 18:48.440
 playing harps?

18:48.440 --> 18:50.120
 And where's God,

18:50.120 --> 18:52.000
 you know,
 old and wise?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.080
 This is his party,
 isn't it,

18:54.080 --> 18:58.080
 or is the boss
 invisible here, too?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.160
 I don't mean
 to be disrespectful.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.760
 It's just that
 I'm scared.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.880
 Would you like
 to speak to God?

19:06.880 --> 19:08.320
 Sure, I'd love to,

19:08.320 --> 19:11.720
 but what do you
 bring the creator
 who has everything?

19:11.720 --> 19:13.520
 Well, you should
 rejoice, Wayne.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.960
 You've been healed.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.920
 Be happy.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.800
 Everything
 is perfect here,

19:18.800 --> 19:20.240
 even the people.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.680
 Because being the best

19:21.680 --> 19:24.920
 no longer means
 being better
 than the next person,

19:24.920 --> 19:28.920
 just one step
 closer to our own
 individual perfection.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.320
 Wayne Fiscus?

19:34.320 --> 19:35.600
 Pony Express?

19:35.600 --> 19:38.880
 I'll have
 to ask you to leave.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.320
 Who are you?

19:40.320 --> 19:41.880
 Well, St. Eligius,

19:41.880 --> 19:44.840
 the patron saint of
 artisans and craftsmen.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.600
 He made me
 this bracelet.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.160
 Your statue
 doesn't do you justice.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.600
 Wayne, you
 don't belong here.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.320
 That's what
 I've been saying.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
 I'm alive.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.920
 There are your
 marching orders.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.920
 Hello,
 I must be going.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.240
 He's open. Give me
 the rib splitter.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.640
 We'll
 grab the heart,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.040
 start compressing,
 get the blood
 circulating.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.400
 We'll bring
 Fiscus back.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.920
 Blood gases--
 ph 7.2, p-o2 140,

20:14.920 --> 20:16.800
 p-c02 35, bicarb 9.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.120
 Good. Plenty
 of oxogen.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.120
 Metsenbaums.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.400
 Tech says low
 on O-negative.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.120
 Better find
 blood somewhere.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.880
 He'll need
 plenty in 0.R.

20:23.880 --> 20:27.880
 Jackie, start
 squeezing the heart.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.600
 Why haven't you
 moved him upstairs?

20:31.600 --> 20:32.920
 Wanted him
 stabilized first.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.040
 - There's a hole.
 - Stick your finger in it.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.040
 Get to O.R.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.920
 I'll have the blood
 bank get donors.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.600
 I'll get
 a thoracic surgeon.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.480
 We'll prep things
 up in O.R.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.960
 Wade,
 keep squeezing.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.720
 Ehrlich, grab
 that I.V.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.720
 Let's move.

21:03.160 --> 21:07.160
 Man overboard!

21:15.600 --> 21:19.600
 Pull me in.
 Give me a hand.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.320
 Ahoy, mate.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.640
 Come aboard.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.160
 Peter White.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.440
 What's the story,
 Wayne?

21:28.440 --> 21:30.960
 Point me toward land.
 I'll dog paddle.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.360
 What did I do?

21:32.360 --> 21:35.000
 Besides being
 a doper, rapist,
 lousy doctor - nothing,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.600
 but I'm staying
 in the water.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.120
 Hey, I'm
 a good boy now.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.560
 No women stowed away.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.560
 No drugs on deck.
 Come on.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.080
 Sharks in that water.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.400
 They'll chew you up.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.120
 Well, I'll
 take my chances.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.960
 Wayne, you can't
 tread water forever,

21:52.960 --> 21:56.360
 and that's how long
 we'll be here.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.520
 Where's "here"?

21:58.520 --> 22:00.760
 Hell.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.200
 Ha ha ha!

22:03.200 --> 22:04.720
 Ha ha ha!

22:04.720 --> 22:08.160
 Ha ha ha!

22:08.160 --> 22:10.080
 Pretty nice, isn't it?

22:10.080 --> 22:13.160
 I mean, no wailing
 or gnashing of teeth,

22:13.160 --> 22:15.120
 just peaceful,
 calm water.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.200
 I was cast off
 from purgatory
 right over there.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.160
 And at night,

22:20.160 --> 22:23.160
 sometimes I can
 see the bright light -

22:23.160 --> 22:27.160
 heaven.

22:27.240 --> 22:31.240
 I never get
 any closer, though.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.280
 Where's all your fish?

22:33.280 --> 22:34.600
 I never catch anything.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.680
 Not even a shark?

22:36.680 --> 22:38.920
 There aren't
 any sharks in there.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.880
 I lied.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.720
 I see
 you haven't changed.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.280
 At least here
 you can't hurt anyone.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.040
 Look, Fiscus,
 I did my best in life,

22:47.040 --> 22:50.320
 to be a good husband,
 father, medicine man,

22:50.320 --> 22:51.920
 to fit into society.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.080
 Something never clicked,

22:53.080 --> 22:54.680
 except the trigger
 of the gun

22:54.680 --> 22:56.320
 Shirley Daniels
 used to kill me.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.320
 You got
 what you deserved.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.680
 Right, Fiscus, that's
 what life's about.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.640
 One chance to
 earn brownie points
 to get into heaven.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.560
 You fall short,
 you're put in
 the middle of nowhere!

23:07.560 --> 23:08.960
 Don't rock the boat.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.280
 I think if we all
 rose up against God,

23:12.280 --> 23:13.800
 we'd be better off!

23:13.800 --> 23:16.640
 But people are
 scared, like you.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.960
 You should be
 mad you're here!

23:18.960 --> 23:21.440
 I'm not supposed
 to be. I'm alive!

23:21.440 --> 23:23.600
 Don't be so sure,
 old buddy.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.440
 Don't be so sure.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.960
 See, that's the thing
 about the "big cheese."

23:28.960 --> 23:30.640
 He's a regular funster.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.240
 He puts us here,

23:32.240 --> 23:35.600
 smack dab in the middle
 of an evil world,

23:35.600 --> 23:37.920
 and expects us
 to resist temptation?

23:37.920 --> 23:40.160
 Cruelty to others
 was my reaction

23:40.160 --> 23:42.000
 against the suffering
 I received.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.480
 I got only
 the barest happiness.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.400
 No wonder I was angry.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.920
 We do what we can
 to survive.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.240
 Stop making excuses.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.600
 I think we've got
 something in common -

23:52.600 --> 23:55.720
 we've both had holes
 blown in our chests

23:55.720 --> 23:58.640
 and neither expected
 to end up here.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.760
 We owe that trick
 to the all-knowing,

24:01.760 --> 24:05.760
 all-powerful
 all-forgiving,
 assjack up there!

24:10.840 --> 24:12.280
 I'm going to be sick.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.520
 Not in my boat.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.520
 Hey, Fiscus,
 I lied about lying
 about the sharks,

24:19.760 --> 24:23.760
 and you know
 they love kosher.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.560
 The bleeding
 is slowing.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.000
 He's running
 out of blood.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.120
 Should we scrub?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.080
 No time.

24:29.080 --> 24:33.080
 1, 2, 3.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.800
 Wade,
 keep squeezing.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.760
 Rhythmic compressions.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.320
 Apex to the root,

24:37.320 --> 24:39.600
 otherwise the blood
 won't circulate.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.400
 Fiscus will have
 macaroni salad for brains.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.120
 My hand
 is cramping.

24:44.120 --> 24:48.120
 Step out.
 Ehrlich, take over.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.000
 Where's the surgeon?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.840
 Emergency by-pass.
 It'll be 30 minutes.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.520
 We've got
 to get going.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.800
 What about
 me cutting?

24:55.800 --> 24:57.360
 You're not
 experienced enough

24:57.360 --> 25:01.360
 to repair
 the ventricle under
 these conditions.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.120
 I'll operate.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.080
 Mark.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.800
 Look, there's
 no choice.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.520
 Only chance he has
 is by diving in.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.720
 I'll be here
 just in case.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.720
 You're a real
 confidence-builder.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.320
 You're back!

25:21.320 --> 25:23.280
 I was sent
 to heaven,

25:23.280 --> 25:27.280
 but for some reason
 I got transferred to hell.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.680
 The last thing
 I remember

25:29.680 --> 25:32.520
 is being dumped overboard
 by Peter White.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.680
 Oy!

25:33.680 --> 25:35.080
 This gets worse?

25:35.080 --> 25:36.520
 Let me explain.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.920
 Have a seat.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.880
 I don't want
 a seat,

25:39.880 --> 25:42.440
 just half
 your sandwich.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.320
 You must have been
 rejected from

25:45.320 --> 25:49.080
 and sent to
 for a reason.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.360
 Any suggestions?

25:50.360 --> 25:53.240
 You can escape purgatory
 one of two ways.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.680
 Wait out your time,

25:54.680 --> 25:58.240
 or try to accomplish
 what you didn't on earth.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.520
 After three years,
 you've done nothing

26:00.520 --> 26:01.880
 to leave this place?

26:01.880 --> 26:04.920
 I need good
 material to play
 Yahweh's Palace.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.360
 So start doing
 the jokes, Murray.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.280
 Nah. My act
 was stinko.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.680
 I bombed all over
 the Catskills.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.600
 I had
 a lousy partner.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.480
 I never was any good
 as a solo.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.920
 What about you, Ralph?

26:17.920 --> 26:21.720
 I need my wings,
 but I was foolish
 to think

26:21.720 --> 26:23.680
 I was really
 a bird.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.080
 I was living
 in a delusion,

26:26.080 --> 26:28.000
 incapable of dealing
 with reality.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.880
 You were happy
 as a bird.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.280
 Now you're like
 a man who got clipped.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.200
 You just order
 umbrella drinks.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.040
  WHISTLES BLOW

26:39.040 --> 26:41.560
 Look at them.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.680
 Referees.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.600
 They never
 played the game.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.480
 They just pass judgment
 on the real athletes.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.040
 It's pathetic.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.920
 I'm stuck here
 with a bunch of losers,

26:52.920 --> 26:55.320
 people who don't
 have the guts

26:55.320 --> 26:57.400
 to be champions
 either way,

26:57.400 --> 27:01.400
 good or evil.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.040
 Maybe that's it.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.440
 I could have
 stopped Peter White

27:08.440 --> 27:09.880
 from raping my friends.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.800
 Instead, I just
 did enough

27:11.800 --> 27:13.240
 to ease my conscience,

27:13.240 --> 27:16.080
 but not enough
 to make a difference.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.440
 Don't beat
 yourself up now.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.920
 You can sit around,

27:19.920 --> 27:22.320
 but I'm going
 to do something.

27:22.320 --> 27:26.320
 I'm going back
 and face Peter White.

27:29.040 --> 27:33.040
 But first,
 I better take it easy.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.480
 Rest...

27:38.480 --> 27:42.320
 not feeling right.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.720
 Next to the right
 descending artery.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.120
 Mark, blood gases
 are looking better.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.000
 Boy's got
 a strong heart.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.920
 Wade, how close
 was the wife
 when she shot?

27:51.920 --> 27:53.320
 10, 15 feet.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.720
 So much damage
 from one bullet.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.160
 Bullet enters the body,

27:57.160 --> 27:58.600
 hits cartilage,
 tumbles,

27:58.600 --> 28:00.040
 ricochets off bone.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.920
 Hard to tell
 what path it'll take.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.800
 Shooting people is still
 the coward's way out.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.720
 Maybe she
 meant to take
 his legs out,

28:08.720 --> 28:10.120
 immobilize him,
 like Ironside.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.000
 She couldn't bear
 the pain of being alone.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.440
 That's
 no motive.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.360
 She only had
 her husband.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.640
 Oh, poppycock.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.520
 No person should be
 so dependent on another.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.920
 Take Ellen.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.800
 She's totally devoted,
 but she's got interests

28:24.800 --> 28:26.720
 that aren't
 related to me.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.120
 That makes her
 a complete woman.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.280
 Weak pulse.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.680
 Ehrlich.
 Squeeze harder.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.840
 I'll snap something.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.760
 It's the body's
 most resilient

28:34.760 --> 28:36.200
 and powerful
 muscle.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.280
 His heart's
 in your hands.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.360
 Wipe.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.320
 Move over.
 I'll take it.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.280
 Ready?

28:42.280 --> 28:44.320
 Go.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.480
 Last two units
 of 0-negative.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.480
 They're mine.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.760
 Your own?

28:48.760 --> 28:51.680
 Empty gesture. We'll
 use that up immediately.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.120
 There's
 a citywide shortage.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.760
 There's
 no other choice.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.200
 Find donors.
 Wake patients.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.520
 Ring doorbells.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.320
 Out-of-town.
 Medivac flight.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.680
 Jack, do something.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.920
 Yeah.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.320
 Drag him
 out of the way.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.760
 Get some
 fresh-squeezed

29:07.760 --> 29:09.520
 and a Lorna Doone.

29:09.520 --> 29:10.920
 Open up the saline.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.320
 Dilute what blood
 he has left.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.200
 We'll maintain volume
 and not interrupt the flow.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.720
 All right, Mark?

29:17.720 --> 29:19.400
 I'm fine.

29:19.400 --> 29:23.040
 Suction.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.480
 There's the hole

29:24.480 --> 29:27.120
 below the left
 anterior descending artery.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.520
 Tough to locate.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.920
 What a slug.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.080
 Just making
 a comment, sir.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.120
 I was talking about
 the bullet, clodhopper.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.520
 I'll have to
 suture the wound

29:37.520 --> 29:39.000
 in between compressions.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.440
 I'll lift the heart.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.160
 You make your suture.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.200
 I'll put it down
 and start compression. Up.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.680
 No, I missed it.

29:46.680 --> 29:50.040
 I didn't get
 a good bite
 with the ligature.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.600
 We'll go again.
 Ready? Up.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.760
 Damn it!

29:55.760 --> 29:57.960
 If I could just...
 once more.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.360
 Up.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.600
 Yeah. Got it.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.600
 Ok. Now we're cooking.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.520
 The minute
 I threw you overboard,

30:09.520 --> 30:10.960
 I regretted it.

30:10.960 --> 30:13.360
 Hey. Did you ever
 water ski?

30:13.360 --> 30:15.760
 I lived near
 Long Island Sound.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.680
 Never got off
 the beach.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.600
 It's great.
 I'll show you.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.000
 I used to love
 water skiing.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.880
 You're sitting in the water
 feeling awkward.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.800
 Then you say,
 "hit it!"

30:26.800 --> 30:28.720
 The driver
 nails the throttle.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.600
 The rope tightens,
 and you rise up.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.440
 You're gliding along.
 The water's like glass.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.360
 The mistake
 most people make

30:36.360 --> 30:38.760
 is not keeping
 their knees bent.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.200
 To stay up,

30:40.200 --> 30:43.080
 you got to be
 a little bent.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.520
 Sorry. Not interested.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.960
 That makes
 perfect sense.

30:45.960 --> 30:48.840
 They give me
 a new boat,
 great boards,

30:48.840 --> 30:50.280
 everything
 I ever wanted

30:50.280 --> 30:51.720
 except
 another person.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.880
 This is
 a two-man operation.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.040
 Just not my sport, Peter.

30:56.040 --> 30:59.000
 Besides, I'm
 not feeling red-hot.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.440
 Don't do this
 to me!

31:01.440 --> 31:03.840
 You're the first
 company I've had

31:03.840 --> 31:07.840
 since I was
 plopped down here!

31:08.800 --> 31:11.720
 When I was alive,
 I used people, OK?

31:11.720 --> 31:15.720
 I had power
 over them.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.400
 This is
 great punishment,
 isn't it?

31:18.400 --> 31:21.360
 I never sleep.
 I'm always
 watching out.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.320
 I forget
 what it's like

31:23.320 --> 31:25.240
 to hear
 a human voice.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.400
 Know what?

31:26.400 --> 31:29.720
 I rev up this motor
 to hear the noise.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.400
 For all eternity,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.760
 nobody cares
 or thinks about me.

31:33.760 --> 31:37.760
 I'm just
 left here alone
 to rerun my life.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
 All right.
 Let's go skiing.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.440
 Really? You mean it?

31:44.440 --> 31:45.800
 You'll love this!

31:45.800 --> 31:47.720
 I thought
 for a minute

31:47.720 --> 31:50.080
 God was pulling
 another fast one.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.480
 He gets me
 to the point

31:52.480 --> 31:54.880
 where I'm
 about to be happy,

31:54.880 --> 31:56.760
 then throws me
 a curve.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.320
 But not this time.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.960
 Uh...where's
 my life jacket?

32:01.960 --> 32:05.960
 You don't need one.
 You're not alive.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.680
 Come on, let's go.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.560
 You're going
 to love this.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.560
 You're going
 to love this a lot.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.120
 Thought I was supposed
 to confront you, Peter,

32:31.120 --> 32:32.560
 pay back with violence

32:32.560 --> 32:35.920
 for the violence you did
 to Wendy and Cathy,

32:35.920 --> 32:37.880
 but whatever I could do

32:37.880 --> 32:41.880
 is taken care of.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.080
 There's something
 I want to tell you.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.520
 When you're skiing,

32:46.520 --> 32:49.320
 I'll probably drive
 a little too fast

32:49.320 --> 32:51.280
 or a little too slow,

32:51.280 --> 32:52.720
 but not on purpose.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.720
 It's just who I am.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.960
  MOTOR STARTS

33:00.960 --> 33:04.960
 Now remember,
 keep your knees bent.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.240
 Ready?

33:06.240 --> 33:10.240
 Hit it!

33:24.080 --> 33:25.520
 I'll try another one.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.120
 One sunny day in Miami,

33:28.120 --> 33:31.040
 a grandmother takes
 her grandson to the beach.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.520
 Suddenly, this giant wave

33:32.520 --> 33:34.920
 sweeps the grandmother
 out to sea.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.320
 The grandson.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.920
 That's better.
 I'll call him Joey.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.920
 I need lift
 in my liftoff.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.920
 Dr. Fiscus, you're starting
 to be a regular here.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.320
 I got dumped again.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.720
 I'll never
 get back to heaven.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.200
 I'll never see God.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.600
 Fear not.
 You've inspired us.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.480
 We'll get you through
 those pearly gates.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.920
 Last time on earth,

34:05.920 --> 34:09.280
 I wanted to take off
 and soar to Portugal.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.719
 The ultimate migration.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.120
 The quintessential flight,

34:12.120 --> 34:15.040
 but that's not even
 a short commute

34:15.040 --> 34:19.040
 compared to where
 I'm headed now.

34:19.320 --> 34:23.320
 There's got to be
 a better way.

34:23.520 --> 34:27.320
 A giant wave sweeps
 the grandson Joey
 out to sea.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.760
 The grandmother
 is frantic.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.639
 She runs up and down
 crying, pleading,

34:31.639 --> 34:34.520
 "Please, God,
 don't take Joey.
 He's too little.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.920
 "Take me.
 I'm old. I've lived.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.520
 Return Joey.
 I'll be grateful forever."

34:39.520 --> 34:42.440
 Just then, another
 giant wave rolls in.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.880
 Miracle of miracles,

34:43.880 --> 34:47.239
 the grandson is washed up
 at the grandmother's feet.

34:47.239 --> 34:49.639
 She hugs him
 and kisses him

34:49.639 --> 34:51.080
 and suddenly stops.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.920
 She looks up at heaven
 and says,

34:53.920 --> 34:57.920
 "You know,
 he was wearing a hat!"

34:57.920 --> 34:59.400
 Murray, you're
 getting better.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.520
 Really?

35:00.520 --> 35:04.120
 Ralph, I'm funny.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.480
 Ralph?

35:06.480 --> 35:10.480
  HELICOPTER MOTOR

35:11.280 --> 35:15.280
 It's a dove!

35:23.920 --> 35:26.320
 This is easier
 than I thought.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.680
 I owe it all to you.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.800
 I'm happy
 for you.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.840
 On your way
 to heaven.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.840
 And you're coming with me!

35:45.120 --> 35:49.120
 See you, murray!

35:59.400 --> 36:00.520
 Heart's flaccid.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.920
 We can't restart
 without myocardial tone.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.320
 We're bringing
 him back.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.040
 We've lost enough
 of his generation

36:07.040 --> 36:09.880
 to wars, drugs,
 and stupid car crashes.

36:09.880 --> 36:12.720
 You're right, Donald.
 Fiscus is a doctor.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.160
 My son Stephen, he...

36:15.160 --> 36:16.680
 his interest
 in medicine

36:16.680 --> 36:19.520
 was only fuelled
 by my own ambition.

36:19.520 --> 36:22.400
 I forced him to follow
 in my footsteps.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.880
 He loved the water.

36:23.880 --> 36:27.880
 Would have made
 a good swim coach.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.120
 Morrison,
 where's the blood,

36:30.120 --> 36:31.520
 and who's that bozo?

36:31.520 --> 36:32.960
 I, uh...
 it's a cell-saver.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.360
 And, uh, this
 is Bob...technician.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.280
 Going to
 recycle the blood
 Fiscus has left.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.160
 That's using
 the old pate.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.040
 There's another leak
 in the lower atrium.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.920
 Ehrlich, see if you
 can locate this hole.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.320
 I'm getting tired.

36:47.320 --> 36:51.320
 Jack, get dressed
 and help me out, will you?

36:51.520 --> 36:53.000
 I found the tear.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.520
 I need more light.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.920
 I'll suction the area.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.880
 Morrison,
 you're on my toe!

36:58.880 --> 36:59.840
 Sorry.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.600
 Get around
 the other side!

37:01.600 --> 37:04.480
 It's hard enough
 operating on a heart

37:04.480 --> 37:06.880
 bouncing like
 a Mexican jumping bean

37:06.880 --> 37:09.280
 without you
 making it more difficult.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.640
 Dr. Craig, we've
 been doing compressions
 for so long.

37:12.640 --> 37:16.440
 Has there been
 enough pulsatal flow
 to prevent brain damage?

37:16.440 --> 37:18.840
 Valuable time
 was lost in E.R.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.720
 you let yourself
 get caught up in details.

37:21.720 --> 37:25.080
 In situations like this,
 protocol goes out the window.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.000
 If you haven't
 learned that,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.520
 I've wasted my time.

37:29.520 --> 37:33.520
 We'll defibrillate
 to 25 watts.

37:35.120 --> 37:39.120
 Everyone clear.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.480
 Eve, I have
 to speak with God.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.880
 Maybe at
 today's Eucharist.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.320
 It can't wait.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.480
 Why?

37:51.480 --> 37:54.640
 One minute,
 I'm in the E.R.,
 and the next...

37:54.640 --> 37:57.040
 is the world God's
 shooting gallery?

37:57.040 --> 37:58.960
 He puts us
 in motion,

37:58.960 --> 38:01.320
 and plinks us off
 one by one?

38:01.320 --> 38:05.320
 That's why
 I was born?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.880
 We'll defibrillate again
 after an amp of epi.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.880
 Set up an isuprel drip,
 one to 1,000.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.200
 Come on, Fiscus.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.560
 Sometimes things happen,
 but the plan is never
 revealed.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.440
 Let him tell me
 face to face.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.360
 You either believe
 in God or you don't.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.280
 If you don't,
 you're alone.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.720
 In that case,

38:30.720 --> 38:33.600
 I understand
 why the world's
 a scary place.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.520
 No two ways about it.

38:35.520 --> 38:36.960
 The world is terrifying.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.360
 If you believe
 he loves you

38:39.360 --> 38:41.760
 and wants
 the best for you,

38:41.760 --> 38:45.120
 you have to trust
 that everything
 has a purpose.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.560
 You saw our E.R. -

38:46.560 --> 38:48.960
 abused children,
 mugging victims,
 cancer patients.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.800
 You can't tell me
 there's a purpose to that.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.680
 He also gave us
 the intricacies
 of the human body,

38:55.680 --> 38:57.080
 the miracle of birth,

38:57.080 --> 39:01.080
 and the '69 Mets.

39:01.880 --> 39:05.880
 25 watts, ready.

39:06.120 --> 39:10.120
 Clear.

39:28.040 --> 39:32.040
 Looking for me?

39:32.640 --> 39:33.920
 I'm God.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.000
 Funny.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.040
 I created you
 in my image.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.640
 Then you could've
 done better on the nose.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.040
 Everyone's a critic.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.000
 Have a seat.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.840
 It's OK. Have a seat.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.800
 Your anger at me
 is typical,

39:49.800 --> 39:53.120
 but I didn't invent
 the gun that shot you,

39:53.120 --> 39:56.040
 and I didn't create
 the medical technology

39:56.040 --> 39:57.440
 they're using on you.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.840
 Everybody thinks
 I spend my time

39:59.840 --> 40:01.240
 persecuting them
 individually.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.200
 The world is so vast.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.600
 I'm fortunate
 to get my mail.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.000
 I should feel
 sorry for God?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.840
 No, but I just create
 possibilities,
 circumstances.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.760
 I turn my head,
 I look back.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.440
 Things have changed.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
 Sometimes for better,
 sometimes not.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.880
 But that's OK.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.120
 You all look
 for reasons, rewards.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.400
 But people should
 be more concerned

40:23.400 --> 40:25.640
 with what goes on
 down there,

40:25.640 --> 40:27.240
 and not what comes after.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.240
  BEEP

40:33.640 --> 40:35.360
 Ready.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.040
 Clear.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.400
 I haven't been a saint,
 and I may never be,

40:41.400 --> 40:45.400
 but I'd like a chance
 to do a few more things.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.280
 Like what?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.760
 Finish my residency,
 have a kid,

40:49.760 --> 40:53.080
 and I wouldn't
 mind playing
 for the Red Sox.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.840
 Can I call you Wayne?

40:54.840 --> 40:56.040
 Sure.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.640
 Wayne, you're not
 the first person
 to get up here

40:59.640 --> 41:02.400
 and think they're not
 supposed to be dead.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.040
 But once they
 get used to it,

41:05.040 --> 41:06.480
 most want to stay.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.160
 But if you don't,

41:08.160 --> 41:12.160
 go back.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.640
 20th century man.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.560
 They do as they please.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.560
 It's out of my hands.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.160
 The myocardium
 was badly damaged.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.640
 You did everything
 possible, Mark.

41:28.640 --> 41:32.640
 Wayne's dead.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
 Once more. Recharge.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.720
 Have you decided?

41:44.720 --> 41:48.720
 Yeah. Think I'm
 going to stick
 around after all.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.840
 This will be great.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.360
 No more 36 hours
 on call.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.240
 No more worrying about
 paying the rent.

41:56.240 --> 42:00.240
 I'll finally get
 a full night's sleep.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.400
 Lou Gehrig?

42:04.400 --> 42:08.400
 Clear.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.400
 His heart. It's beating!

42:15.400 --> 42:18.040
 All right!

42:18.040 --> 42:20.000
 Look at that.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.400
 Thank God.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.160
 OK, we'll close.
 3-0 polydec.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.600
 Thank you.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.520
 I'll give you
 some suction.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.960
 There we go.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.960
 There we go.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.520
 His B.P.'s
 120 over 80,

42:41.520 --> 42:42.920
 lung function's
 normal.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.800
 Fiscus will be
 just fine.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.720
 You really impressed
 me tonight.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.160
 You, too, my friend.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.600
 I've never felt better

42:49.600 --> 42:52.520
 about being a doctor
 in my life.

42:52.520 --> 42:56.520
 We're back, Donald.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.880
 Cell-saver was
 a great idea.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.280
 I was paralyzed
 up to now.

43:02.280 --> 43:06.280
 Doing my community
 outreach work
 at Newcastle prison...

43:08.320 --> 43:11.720
 when the riot broke out,
 the inmates went crazy.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.640
 I should've
 been stronger.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.160
 Well, if I'd
 made a decision,

43:16.160 --> 43:17.640
 if I'd acted quicker,

43:17.640 --> 43:21.640
 I wouldn't have been...

43:22.240 --> 43:24.320
 I wouldn't
 have been raped.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.320
 I never heard you
 use that word before,

43:27.320 --> 43:29.520
 come out and
 say what happened.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.720
 It's tough being honest.

43:32.720 --> 43:36.720
 With others, ourselves.

43:37.120 --> 43:40.520
 I'm going to check
 on Fiscus before we leave.

43:40.520 --> 43:42.360
 Hey, where
 have you been?

43:42.360 --> 43:43.840
 In the park.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.520
 Dangerous business.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.080
 It was worth it.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.520
 Need a ride home?

43:48.520 --> 43:51.800
 No, thanks. I'll stay
 the night in on-call.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.720
 What about going home?

43:53.720 --> 43:56.600
 This is my home
 in a way.

43:56.600 --> 44:00.600
 You know, I was
 really starting
 to despise medicine.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.680
 I thought
 it was to blame
 for my divorce.

44:03.680 --> 44:06.520
 And I realized
 my career
 is my passion.

44:06.520 --> 44:08.480
 There's nothing
 wrong with that.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.880
 I'm due back in an hour,

44:10.880 --> 44:14.200
 enough time to go home
 and change my undies.

44:14.200 --> 44:16.720
 How's Fiscus doing?

44:16.720 --> 44:17.880
 Miracle.

44:17.880 --> 44:19.320
 All right.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.600
 See you
 tomorrow, guys.

44:20.600 --> 44:24.600
 Ok.
 Ok.
