00:36.500 --> 00:39.628
Yes, believe your eyes.
Those are the northern lights...
 2 
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,423
on viewabove the city
for the first time in nearly 80 years.
 3 
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:52,722
lt's 5..00a.m. Hello, New York.
The big story this morning...
 4 
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:55,892
is the Amazins taking
the field today in Baltimore...
 5 
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:58,310
for their final practice
before tomorrow's opener...
 6 
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,521
of the 1969 Worlds--
 7 
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:06,109
Sanitation workers discovered the
deadbody of another nurse in Queens.
 8 
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,861
This is the third nurse killed in what
New York papers are now calling...
 9 
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,946
the ''Nightingale Murders. ''
 10 
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,414
All three victims have been nurses,
each found strangled...
 11 
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:25,751
with their hands gruesomely bound
behind their backs with tape.
 12 
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,795
The lights, also known
as the aurora borealis--
 13 
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,588
Look out!
 14 
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,470
Move it!
 15 
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:46,686
Manhattan calling Eye of the Storm.
 16 
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,355
Engine Company 12,
Ladder Company 93...
 17 
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,651
respond to Manhattan box 132 off-ramp
of the George Washington Bridge.
 18 
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,527
On our way.
 19 
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:00,656
Confirm overturned tanker. Workers
trapped in underground substation.
 20 
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,200
Frank! We're second in.
 21 
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:05,452
- We got the rescue.
- Okay.
 22 
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,061
Commander, what do you need done?
 23 
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:39,106
That dike's about to go, and we're
one spark away from losing the block.
 24 
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:41,691
- Is there another way in?
- That manhole leads to the vault.
 25 
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,277
Forget it, Sullivan.
 26 
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,821
Vault door's rusted shut,
and they can't kill the juice.
 27 
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,949
Isn't enough time to make it!
 28 
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:55,453
What? Miss the World Series?
Not a chance. Give me my tools.
 29 
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:03,502
Sullivan! This is Commandero Connell.
Can you hear me?
 30 
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:07,130
- I hear you, Commander.
- The gasoline is risin 'in the vault.
 31 
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:10,383
Those downed cables hit that gas,
it's gonna blow.
 32 
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:14,928
- Way to go, Gib.
- I shoulda been a god damn mailman.
 33 
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,558
Clear this channel.
Explosion's imminent.
 34 
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,315
Hey, guys!
Can you hear me?
 35 
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,567
- Yeah, we're in here.
- We're comin' in.
 36 
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,235
Get us outta here!
 37 
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,529
He's got a broken leg!
Get us out!
 38 
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:42,619
It's gonna flash. Get outta there.
Dike isn't holdin'.
 39 
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,496
- Get us out!
- Frank, do you hear me?
 40 
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,540
Yeah, I hear you, Butch.
 41 
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,500
- Grab that ax.
- Here.
 42 
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,754
Give me a whack. No sparks. Again.
 43 
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,339
One more.
 44 
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,424
Okay, stand back.
 45 
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,018
Oh, thank God.
 46 
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:13,062
Oh. Yeah, my leg's all busted up.
 47 
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:17,899
- Please hurry.
- We're in, Butch.
 48 
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:19,984
Get 'em and get the hell out.
 49 
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,779
Hey, fellas, time to go home.
 50 
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,822
Watch it, watch it!
 51 
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,992
- It's gone! It's gonna break!
- Back, back! Let's go!
 52 
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,535
That's an order.
Everybody goes.
 53 
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:38,250
All right, let's move
before the gas lights up.
 54 
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,002
Watch that wire.
 55 
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:43,630
Get out, for Christ's sake.
 56 
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,673
I gotcha.
 57 
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,430
Butch, Butch,
we're comin' out right now.
 58 
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:57,642
- Go!
- You all right? Watch your head.
 59 
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:02,354
Get up that ladder.
Go ahead.
 60 
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,189
Get up, get up!
 61 
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,236
Go on up!
 62 
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,198
Go! Right behind you.
 63 
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,033
Keep going.
Pull him out.
 64 
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:21,204
Come on! Come on, come on.
I gotcha. I gotcha.
 65 
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:59,070
Welcome to the company, Gib.
 66 
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:47,654
Hey, fellas.
 67 
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:56,286
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey. Hey, Gordo.
 68 
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:59,330
- Hey, Mr. Sullivan.
- How you doin'?
 69 
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,168
- How's my Little Chief, huh?
- Good.
 70 
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:07,087
- Where's your mother?
- Inside the house.
 71 
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,507
October 10th
1969''
 72 
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:19,514
Hey,Jules.
 73 
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,016
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, bud.
 74 
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:26,187
That was ''Heat Wave. ''Martha and
the Vandellas on WOR New York radio.
 75 
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,689
Hey, how about a little bit
of the King, huh?
 76 
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:32,067
Yeah, why not a little
of the King?
 77 
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,569
- Damn!
- You all right?
 78 
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:39,156
Yeah! I think I ruined the sauce.
Again.
 79 
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:40,658
What's the matter, bud?
 80 
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,327
You havin' trouble working
an eight-hour shift at the hospital...
 81 
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,704
watchin' the kid,
whippin' up a little Bolognese?
 82 
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,791
- You didn't marry Donna Reed.
- Hey!
 83 
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:53,794
I'd go for you and Chinese takeout
over her any day.
 84 
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:57,756
Because l love you too much
 85 
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,841
Baby
 86 
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,846
Why can't you see
 87 
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:09,599
- What you're doin' to me
- How was your tour?
 88 
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:11,184
The usual. You know.
 89 
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,935
- Butch called.
- Did he?
 90 
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,228
He did.
 91 
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,731
It was under control, bud.
 92 
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,609
Butchy, he's gettin' a little tight
in his old age.
 93 
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:23,111
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank.
Long as you get there.
 94 
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:07,900
All right, Chief, when I let go,
I want you to keep pedaling.
 95 
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,693
Daddy, put the wheels back on.
I'm gonna fall.
 96 
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:12,904
Don't worry about falling.
You're ready to do this.
 97 
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:15,448
Come on. Spirit and guts, okay?
 98 
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,244
All right. Keep pedalin'.
I'm gonna let go.
 99 
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,580
That's it!
Keep pedalin'.
 100 
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:26,249
Keep pedalin', keep pedalin'.
Yeah!
 101 
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,168
- Ow!
- You all right? You all right?
 102 
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:30,961
- No, Dad.
-Johnny!
 103 
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,923
You okay? You hurt? You okay?
 104 
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,759
- I wanna go to my room.
- Okay. Go on, honey. It's okay.
 105 
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:40,594
Hey, come on, Chief.
Don't quit on me now.
 106 
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:43,472
Don't be so tough on him, Frank.
He's just a kid.
 107 
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:48,309
He just needs to know
you're behind him.
 108 
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,106
Okay. You're right.
All right.
 109 
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,022
CQ-22, this is W-2-QYV,
by for call.
 110 
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:43,065
Because of the solar activity.
 111 
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:46,109
Yeah, it's beautiful. We got the sky
over my house lit up like a bonfire.
 112 
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,403
Word is the sunspots
are shooting off flares...
 113 
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:51,864
that stretch out
half a million kilometers.
 114 
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:55,075
Tell me about it. l'm pickin' up signals
from places l could never reach before.
 115 
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,536
Francis, is that you?
How are you doing?
 116 
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,538
Hey, l'm doing just great.
How you doing?
 117 
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:03,082
Fantastic. My wife, Sophia,
she's gonna give me another baby.
 118 
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,625
Wow!
 119 
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,476
October 10th

11:38.571 --> 11:41.073
So, that's it, Samantha?
You're just walkin' out?
 121 
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:43,367
I've been walkin' out
for six months, John.
 122 
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,536
You just didn't notice or care.
 123 
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:54,460
You were right.
We shoulda quit a long time ago.
 124 
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,175
I'm sorry. I know it's my fault.
 125 
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,595
I can't change, Sam.
I wish I could, but I can't.
 126 
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:09,640
John, it's that you won't change.
 127 
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:14,227
And that's what hurts so much.
 128 
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,356
Good-bye, Chief.
 129 
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:17,782
Next up,Johnny Sullivan.
 130 
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,788
lt's a hit up the middle.
 131 
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:30,084
Johnny's gonna hold at first.
 132 
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,298
And now batting for Johnny's father,
Coach Newman.
 133 
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,806
Checks the runner and fires.
 134 
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,351
Lined hard to right.
 135 
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:52,228
- No problem. One on, one out.
- Hi, Uncle John.
 136 
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:56,190
- I'm not your uncle, kid.
- Hey, Sully, is that you?
 137 
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:59,401
- Gordo, why are you guys in my house?
- My TV's out again.
 138 
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:05,948
- Hey, uh, you want a brewski?
- Yeah.
 139 
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:09,076
- Deep fly ball into center field.
- Do you believe Linda...
 140 
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,203
still won't let me cook in the house?
 141 
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:14,539
- I melt one lousy frying pan.
-John, guess what.
 142 
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:18,709
- Dad's takin' me fiishin'. Wanna come?
- I wish I could, Gordy.
 143 
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,378
But you bring me back a big one, okay?
 144 
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:25,173
-Is it okay if Gordy uses your old gear?
-Yeah, I think it's in the hall closet.
 145 
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,510
- If you can find it.
- Gordy, have a look, huh?
 146 
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,764
So Yahoo went up
another five points today.
 147 
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,310
- Man, did I miss the boat on that one.
- Shoulda, woulda, coulda, pal.
 148 
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,312
So Sam called Linda.
 149 
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:44,690
Dad, John, come here.
 150 
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:46,608
What are you doin' back there?
 151 
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,194
- Dad, check it out.
- Wow!
 152 
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:52,405
Fire department.
Can I open it up?
 153 
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:55,366
Sure.
 154 
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:05,291
- Whoa!
- Eh, eh, eh, give me that gun.
 155 
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,835
All right?
 156 
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:12,214
- Hey, what's this, Dad?
- Oh, my God.
 157 
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,717
John, it's your dad's old ham radio.
 158 
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:20,471
Remember how we used to beg him
to let us talk on this thing?
 159 
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:23,474
- This is not a toy.
- Is not a toy.
 160 
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,267
- Can we try it, Dad?
- Ask Uncle John.
 161 
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,895
- Can we try it?
- What the hell.
 162 
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:32,231
All right.
Let's grab this baby out.
 163 
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:36,401
This is what we used
when I was your age.
 164 
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:40,280
Let's go over to the den, huh?
Plug it in, just like old times.
 165 
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,448
We want CW or LSB.
 166 
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:46,368
Standby function. Operator, come on.
 167 
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:50,455
I don't know what's goin' on.
Let's take a look under the hood, huh?
 168 
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,540
See what we got here.
 169 
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:58,420
Check this baby out.
There she is.
 170 
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,923
So this is what people used
before the Net, huh?
 171 
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,550
Well, not exactly. I'll tell ya.
Hams were--
 172 
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,386
Ah, bingo.
These babies were different.
 173 
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:08,387
Not everybody had one of these...
 174 
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:11,932
and you needed a special license
just to be able to talk on 'em.
 175 
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:15,102
Damn. I just-- I just--
 176 
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,062
- I don't think it's gonna work here.
- It's junk, kid.
 177 
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,564
Nobody uses those things anymore.
 178 
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:23,275
Gordo! Do you know what time it is?
Hey, John.
 179 
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,861
- Hi, Linda.
- Come on, Gordy, let's go.
 180 
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,990
I'll catch you later, all right?
If I'm lucky.
 181 
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,077
So feed him.
 182 
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,371
Put it down there for him.
 183 
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,125
l'm not gonna speak
if you continue to say that word.
 184 
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:48,547
Hi, this is Julia Sullivan.
Please leave a message after the tone.
 185 
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,716
Hey, Ma, it's me.
 186 
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:55,219
Just checkin' in.
You're probably at work.
 187 
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:59,974
Anyways, um, I'll see you
tomorrow night.
 188 
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,517
- My grandmother was senile.
- Love you.
 189 
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,644
She had such fun on her birthdays.
She'd open her presents...
 190 
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:09,482
and drift off, then look down,
see her present and get happy again.
 191 
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:12,818
That's what my father does
with his breakfast cereal.
 192 
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:18,990
The aurora borealis,
to anyone who's seen it...
 193 
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:22,535
is one of the stunning events
of your lifetime.
 194 
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:25,746
They're brighter these days.
ls something going on there?
 195 
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,081
Do they tie in with your field?
Where do they come from?
 196 
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,792
lt's a stunning sight.
lt's beautiful to look at.
 197 
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,545
l don't think we've seen one
quite this bright for maybe 30 years.
 ''Professor''
 198 
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:38,048
But, from the point of view of physics
and string theory...
 199 
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,758
there's nothing really
that we gain...
 200 
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,218
from studying the aurora borealis.
 201 
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:45,471
Now history does teach us everytime
we thought we had it figured out...
 202 
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:48,349
there was some major discovery
right around the bend...
 203 
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:52,686
that required a dramatic change in our
understanding of the laws of physics.
 204 
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:56,064
This is aphrase people have begun
to hear-- string theory.
 205 
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:58,357
Yes. Yes, that's right.
 206 
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,401
String theory dramatically changes...
 207 
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:02,361
our understanding
of space and time.
 208 
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:06,322
For example, string theory requires
our universe to have ten...
 209 
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:08,324
or possibly even eleven dimensions.
 210 
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:11,077
And the strange thing is some physicists
are even pursuing the idea...
 211 
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,495
that there might be
more than one time dimension.
 212 
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:15,956
So, in addition to time as we knowit,
psychological time...
 213 
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,002
- which seems to organize events--
- CQ-15, W-2-QYV, by for call.
 214 
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:29,176
CQ-15, CQ-15, come in, 15.
 215 
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:32,553
Uh, hello?
 216 
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,933
Hey, W-2-QYV here.
Who have l got?
 217 
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:40,644
Name's John.
 218 
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,647
License to broadcast, buddy?
 219 
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:50,235
Look, I really don't remember
how this thing works.
 220 
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:53,029
Listen, you can't broadcast
without a license.
 221 
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:56,908
Unless this is an emergency,
you're gonna have to get off the band.
 222 
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,994
Hey, pal, my whole life's
an emergency.
 223 
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,745
Where you transmittin' from?
 224 
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:05,123
Queens, New York.
 225 
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:08,626
Well, what do you know?
Bay side, born and raised.
 226 
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,213
No kidding? I thought these things
were for talking around the world.
 227 
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:14,965
Yeah, well, the 15 band closes down
at night...
 228 
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:19,344
but during the day you can chew
the band with China if you want.
 229 
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:22,054
I can't believe people are still
using these things.
 230 
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:25,182
- You must be a real old-timer, huh?
- Days like this...
 231 
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,768
I feel like I'm gettin' there,
you know?
 232 
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:31,104
So, Queens, you psyched
for the Series, huh?
 233 
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:35,358
You know, l really don't follow
baseball anymore.
 234 
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:37,568
What?
 235 
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,904
- I got fed up with all the bullshit.
- What are you talkin 'about?
 236 
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:43,198
Let me tell you,
a thousand years from now...
 237 
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,158
when school kids
study about America...
 238 
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,159
they're gonna learn about three things:
 239 
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:49,745
the Constitution, rock and roll...
 240 
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:51,788
and baseball.
 241 
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:56,960
How can you live in Queens
and not love the Amazins?
 242 
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:01,630
The Amazin' Mets?
What, the '69 Series?
 243 
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:05,008
Man, I'll love Ron Swoboda
till the day I die.
 244 
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,053
Well, now I'm with ya.
He's got the heart of a lion.
 245 
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:10,138
Mets can't win game one without him.
 246 
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,474
- Can you hear me?
- Game one? What are you talkin' about?
 247 
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:17,978
It was all over after Buford nailed
Seaver's second pitch outta the park.
 248 
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:23,649
Hey, no way, buddy. Ain't gonna happen.
Hey, CQ-15. CQ-15.
 249 
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,610
Are you there?
 250 
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,656
Who the hell was that?
 251 
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,826
Queens? Are you there, Queens?
Did I lose ya?
 252 
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:40,038
Hey, Frank, give the radio a rest.
Your son wants to say good night.
 253 
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:42,624
All right, I'll be right there.
 254 
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,630
Elvis, you all right?
Oh, sorry.
 255 
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,882
- You okay, Frank?
- We're fine. You all right?
 256 
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:56,469
You okay, buddy?
 257 
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:00,806
The sunspots are going to have
a serious impact...
 258 
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,434
on radio communication
for the next six or seven days.
 259 
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,812
ln fact, quantum theory tells us
the rigid notions...
 260 
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:10,523
of past, present and future,
although use fulin day-to-day life...
 261 
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:13,859
may dissolve and be replaced
by a complex formulation...
 262 
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:17,529
in which time is far more fluid
than anybody would have imagined.
 263 
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:22,617
Take me out to the ballgame
 264 
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,662
Take me out with the crowd
 265 
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:32,625
Buy me some peanuts
and Cracker Jack
 266 
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:37,922
I don't care if I never get back
 267 
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,591
'Cause it's root, root, root
 268 
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,094
For the home team
 269 
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,221
lf we don't win
 270 
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:53,769
Two, three strikes
you're out
 271 
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,731
At the old ballgame
 272 
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:01,525
You got it. That's perfect.
 273 
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,527
Hey, Butch, you gotta turn
the whole set.
 274 
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:06,071
Can't wait till the game.
 275 
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:09,574
It's not the tuner,
it's the antenna.
 276 
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,535
- Proby.
- What?
 277 
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:15,871
Point the antenna out
from under the house a little bit.
 278 
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,706
There it is.
Hey!
 279 
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,334
- I'm gonna get a beer. Want one?
- Yeah, yeah.
 280 
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:24,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Proby, walk away.
 281 
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:27,756
- Walkin' away.
- If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
 282 
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,719
- Here we go, Butch. Here we go.
- Hey, Satch. Grab a seat. Come on.
 283 
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:37,056
Sully, I think I need to get a new set
of cleats. I lost my footing there.
 284 
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,724
Yeah! Yeah!
 285 
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:42,060
- Right.
- Dr. Deleon, you decided to join us.
 286 
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,562
You don't wanna know.
 287 
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,147
Thirty-six hours,
I was bouncing off the walls.
 288 
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,358
That's why you're the doctor
and I'm the nurse.
 289 
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:52,361
- Hey, baby. Can I get you something?
- No, it's all right.
 290 
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:56,156
- I am starving.
- I'm ready.
 291 
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:59,158
Sit down.
 292 
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:00,952
- How you boys doin'?
- Good, Satch.
 293 
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:06,373
- Okay, I got something for you.
- I can't believe it!
 294 
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:09,834
- And I got something for you.
- Whoa!
 295 
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:12,545
- Dad, look!
- What? You gotta be--
 296 
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:14,839
Hey, Satch, you Santa Claus?
 297 
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,425
Game three tickets.
Did you say thank you or what?
 298 
00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:21,011
- Thank you, Uncle Satch.
- You're welcome.
 299 
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:23,513
Thank you. Thank you, Satch.
 300 
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:25,139
Hey, hey, all right, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!
 301 
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:27,892
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Everybody.
 302 
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:31,311
- Everybody say, ''Amazin' Mets.''
- Amazing Mets!
 303 
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:54,206
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.
 304 
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,292
You ain't never gonna find
another one like Sam.
 305 
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,961
She made up her mind, Satch.
Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
 306 
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:03,172
- Nothin' you're willing to do.
- What's the story?
 307 
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:06,758
Construction crew found a body,
actually, a skeleton.
 308 
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:14,849
Okay. Well, be real careful
when you pull it out.
 309 
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,352
- Make sure you get the dirt around it.
- Yes, sir.
 310 
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:21,688
- So, what's this construction?
- I think I'll visit the neighbors.
 311 
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,440
Yeah, okay.
 312 
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,609
- What did they tear down here?
- Greek diner.
 313 
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:31,029
Used toget breakfast there
all the time.
 314 
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:33,198
Them Greeks were good people.
 315 
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:36,242
- Careful. It's hot.
- Thank you, Mrs. Shepard.
 316 
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:41,288
Once that McDonald's opened up on
Dyckman, they lost all their business.
 317 
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,541
- I see your son's on the job.
- Was.
 318 
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,669
Jack died a while back.
 319 
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,962
It's hard, I know.
 320 
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:52,006
It just seems like yesterday.
 321 
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:56,218
My son lived and bled blue.
 322 
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,137
- l wanna get outta here.
- Okay, Detective.
 323 
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,056
- Give my regards to Steph.
- Sure will.
 324 
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:07,686
This isn't gonna be anything
but a history lesson.
 325 
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:09,771
Let's go back to the house.
 326 
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:26,619
- Hey, Barney. How you doin'?
- Good.
 327 
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:31,206
- There you go. Have a good night.
- Bye.
 328 
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:38,546
- I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
- Hey, sounds good.
 329 
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,923
I'm sorry Samantha couldn't make it.
 330 
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:46,761
Yeah, those grad school applications
are drivin' her crazy.
 331 
00:25:47,804 --> 00:25:50,264
- How's it comin'?
- I got the VCR hooked up.
 332 
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:52,266
It's just this friggin' clock.
 333 
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:54,018
Doesn't matter.
 334 
00:25:56,937 --> 00:26:01,899
- God damn it. I'm sorry, Mom.
- Hey, you know, it's all right.
 335 
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:06,278
- I'm sure everything'll work out.
- What's that?
 336 
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,239
- With Sam.
- Oh, yeah, you know...
 337 
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:11,199
just a tough time right now,
you know.
 338 
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:15,453
- So how are things at the hospital?
- Fine.
 339 
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:18,664
- Hey, Dr. Schwartz retired last month.
- No kidding.
 340 
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:22,375
- He must've been pushing 90.
- Close, yeah.
 341 
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:27,088
So, how'd you like The Lion King?
 342 
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,466
Oh, I loved it, you sweet kid.
I wish you'd gone.
 343 
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,176
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
It's just work.
 344 
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,096
Yeah, well, you work too hard.
 345 
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,139
Look who's talkin'.
 346 
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,235
- It's tomorrow.
- Thirty years.
 347 
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:57,447
I wish I could remember him better.
 348 
00:26:57,531 --> 00:27:02,660
He was just a big kid.
He wanted to play baseball forever.
 349 
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:06,830
And fighting fires, he loved that.
 350 
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:12,002
And you-- he loved you.
 351 
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:17,048
- Okay, guys, bedtime.
- Okay, Mom.
 352 
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:20,217
Looking good.
We'll do it again tomorrow, Chief.
 353 
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:22,302
Good night, Dad.
 354 
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:27,890
CQ-15, CQ-15.
 355 
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,852
W-2-QYV...
 356 
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:36,147
calling unidentified station, Queens.
 357 
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:41,694
CQ-15, W-2-QYV...
 358 
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:44,446
calling unidentified station, Queens.
 359 
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,992
- CQ-15. Come in, Queens.
- Hello.
 360 
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:55,039
Hey, hey, is that you? I've been tryin'
to call you all night. Where you been?
 361 
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:59,292
Hey, I--
How the hell did you do it?
 362 
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:03,046
- Do what?
- Do what? The Series.
 363 
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:06,132
You called Buford's homer.
How the hell did you do it?
 364 
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:09,551
It wasn't too tough, buddy,
the game happened 30 years ago.
 365 
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:12,679
Yeah, right, right, yeah.
Thirty years ago. Yeah, sure.
 366 
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:15,223
So I suppose you could tell me
what happened in game two, huh?
 367 
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:18,559
Yeah, sure. Top of the ninth.
Al Weis, game-winning RBI single.
 368 
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:22,604
Brooks Robins on grounds out
to end the game.
 369 
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,190
Daddy, come up and sing
the baseball song.
 370 
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:27,609
Hey, Little Chief.
You all right?
 371 
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:31,403
Well, you just go on up.
l'll be there in a minute, allright?
 372 
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,280
Allright.
 373 
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:37,200
- Sorry about that. That was my kid.
- What'd you just say?
 374 
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,369
I said, sorry about that.
My kid just came in.
 375 
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:44,123
- You call your son ''Little Chief''?
- Yeah.
 376 
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:47,042
What'd you say your name was?
 377 
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,461
Frank. Frank Sullivan.
 378 
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:53,756
Is this some kind of joke? Gordo,
is that you? Are you messing with me?
 379 
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,425
No, I ain't messin' with you.
Look, I'm just tryin' to figure out--
 380 
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:59,386
You're tellin 'me your name is
Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens...
 381 
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:04,474
and you wanna know how I called
the first game of the 1969 World Series?
 382 
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,810
Yeah, that's exactly
what I wanna know.
 383 
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:13,773
Gordo, if this is you, so help me.
What'd you say your--
 384 
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:18,236
What'd you say your call station--
or your call letters were?
 385 
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:23,031
W-2-QYV.
 386 
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:30,079
Now you listen to me.
My name is John Francis Sullivan.
 387 
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:34,291
I live at 343 42nd Avenue,
where I lived my whole life...
 388 
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:38,962
and I saw the first game
of the 1969 World Series right here...
 389 
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,672
- in this house 30 years ago.
- Bullshit.
 390 
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:44,633
My father's name is
Francis Patrick Sullivan.
 391 
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,886
He was a firefighter
and a die-hard Mets fan...
 392 
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,556
and every night when I went to bed,
he sang, ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game.''
 393 
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:00,480
Hey, who the hell are you?
 394 
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:02,023
Son of a bitch.
 395 
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:06,819
- What's goin' on?
- Nothin's goin' on.
 396 
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:15,243
Oh, my God.
 397 
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:18,663
You burnt the desk.
I can see it.
 398 
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:20,706
Are you still there?
 399 
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,001
I said, you burnt the desk.
I can see it. Hello?
 400 
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:29,839
Hello?Are you still there?
Come back. Talk to me.
 401 
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:32,133
Hello?
 402 
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:34,718
Hello?
 403 
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,513
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You listen to me right now.
 404 
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:41,057
I don't know who you are.
I don't know why you're doing this.
 405 
00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:43,100
But let me tell you something,
asshole.
 406 
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:45,936
You stay away
from me and my family.
 407 
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,855
No, no, no, you gotta believe me.
 408 
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:52,775
I don't know how this is happening,
but it's me, Little Chief.
 409 
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,403
Hey, hey, hey, look, look,
I am warning you!
 410 
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,948
If you touch my kid, I will hunt you
down till the day I die. You got that?
 411 
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,368
But you already died.
 412 
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,119
What are you talkin' about?
 413 
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:07,163
The Buxton fire.
 414 
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,206
Oh, yeah?
 415 
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:11,250
And when did that happen?
Thirty years ago?
 416 
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,585
October 12, 1969.
 417 
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,253
Tomorrow.
You're tellin' me I'm gonna d--
 418 
00:31:15,378 --> 00:31:18,339
Look, lain't dyin' in no fire tomorrow
or any other day, you got that?
 419 
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:20,007
Listen, tomorrow hasn't happened.
 420 
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:22,092
That's right, it hasn't happened.
It ain't gonna happen.
 421 
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,469
You gotta listen to me.
It was an abandoned warehouse.
 422 
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:27,597
Butch always told Ma it wasn't your
fault. You went with your instincts.
 423 
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,933
- I'm warning you.
- Listen to me!
 424 
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:32,435
If you'd gone the other way,
you would've made it.
 425 
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:34,520
Hello?
 426 
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,696
Hello? Shit.
 427 
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:20,476
- Sully, what are you doing, man?
- I talked to him. I talked to my dad.
 428 
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,937
Sull, go in the house, all right?
I'm gonna come over, we'll hang out.
 429 
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:27,399
No, no, no, I gotta get him back
so he doesn't go in.
 430 
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:29,275
Go in? What are you--
Go in where?
 431 
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,944
The warehouse in Buxton.
It's tomorrow.
 432 
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:52,003
Yeah, right, right, yeah.
Thirty years ago? Yeah, sure.
 433 
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:55,340
So I suppose you can tell me
what happened in game two, huh?
 434 
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:59,426
Yeah, sure. Top of the ninth,
Al Weis, game-winnin' RBI single.
 435 
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:03,221
- Come on, hit it out.
- Come on, Al.
 436 
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:07,266
- One run.
- Look at the stats. Look at them.
 437 
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:11,061
Let's go, Weis.
 438 
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,610
We have a three and two response,
Ladder 93.
 439 
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:23,864
You're first due. lt's reported to be
an abandoned warehouse...
 440 
00:33:23,948 --> 00:33:26,283
at the foot of Water Street and Third.
 441 
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,618
Now, you got some construction
limiting access.
 442 
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,537
Al Weis is having a great Series.
 443 
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,851
Yeah, they won!
 444 
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:02,189
You all right?
 445 
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,381
We know it's vacant.
 446 
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:34,050
Nobody goes in.
Surround and drown.
 447 
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:39,971
Call for a tower.
 448 
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:44,142
- Help!
- Shit. We got squatters inside.
 449 
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:46,394
Help!
 450 
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:51,690
- Help me! My sister's--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 451 
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:55,068
- She's up there. She passed out.
- Where is your sister?
 452 
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,653
- I tried to help her.
- Tell me! What floor?
 453 
00:34:57,737 --> 00:35:01,865
She's up there on the top floor.
I tried, I tried.
 454 
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,242
- Please, help her! Please!
- Butch, take her.
 455 
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:06,828
Come on, follow me.
Anybody else up there?
 456 
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:21,758
Ryan, get her medical treatment.
 457 
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,936
- Give me my gear.
- You have fire in the top floor.
 458 
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:40,274
Yeah, these are good.
Hey, Sull.
 459 
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:47,154
- Hey, here he is. How you feelin'?
- What can I tell you?
 460 
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Better.
 461 
00:35:57,664 --> 00:36:01,083
No visible fire
first or second floor.
 462 
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:07,088
Watch your step, Proby.
This floor's rotten.
 463 
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:14,303
Fire on the third floor.
We need a line. We're goin 'up.
 464 
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:16,138
We got two lines comin'.
 465 
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,704
- Back out, kid. Wait for the line.
- To hell with the line.
 466 
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,748
- I'll find another way up.
- No, you can't help me here.
 467 
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:19,818
So you doin' okay, John?
 468 
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:23,404
You know, tough day, you know?
 469 
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:30,368
Hey, here's to your dad, huh?
 470 
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,078
Thirty years today.
 471 
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,913
To your dad.
 472 
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:35,998
To my dad.
 473 
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,881
We're pullin' everyone
outta the building.
 474 
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:54,598
Get that ladder on the top floor.
lt's cooking up here.
 475 
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:58,226
So after that Halloween thing
with the fire truck-- You remember?
 476 
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:00,853
Yeah, I remember riding
with Butch and your dad...
 477 
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,938
and the whole neighborhood
was watching.
 478 
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:05,732
I remember.
I wanted to go as a cop.
 479 
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:08,985
Yeah, so Jules makes your dad
buy you that--
 480 
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:12,530
- that cop kit for your birthday.
- Oh, I remember that.
 481 
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:15,032
I was always the robber.
I was always being hand-cuffed.
 482 
00:38:15,115 --> 00:38:17,117
That's right.
I taught you to do that.
 483 
00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:46,601
10-45, I found the girl.
 484 
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:49,103
- She's breathin'.
- We're gettin' 'em out.
 485 
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:05,492
Hang on!
What the hell is goin' on?
 486 
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:09,454
- Gino, what's the matter?
- The gear box, it's cracked.
 487 
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:14,458
Frank, the ladder's jammed.
You gotta find another way out.
 488 
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:17,294
Frank, can you hear me?
 489 
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:34,517
It worked out okay, though.
You're a better cop than a fireman.
 490 
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:38,312
- No doubt about it.
- Worked out good for me too.
 491 
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:41,065
I'm glad I didn't have to spend
ten years as his hose man.
 492 
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:44,609
Yeah, I bet you are.
 493 
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:52,992
The Buxton fire.
If you'd just gone the other way.
 494 
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:18,180
Frank, we're losin' the building.
 495 
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:20,515
I know.
 496 
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:31,285
Hey, hey, this is not a toy.
 497 
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,922
- Wave to your ma.
- Look at us.
 498 
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,104
You're gonna be some ball player.
 499 
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:21,953
- Whoa!John, are you all right?
-John,John.
 500 
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:24,414
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?
 501 
00:42:24,497 --> 00:42:26,666
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, can you bring a towel?
 502 
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:49,310
Satch, my father didn't die
in a fire, right?
 503 
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:51,479
Gordo, my father didn't die
in a fire.
 504 
00:42:57,526 --> 00:42:59,569
No. What are you talking about?
He had cancer.
 505 
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:08,410
Cancer because of his cigarettes, right?
The cigarettes?
 506 
00:43:08,494 --> 00:43:10,662
Yeah. Lung cancer. Ten years ago.
 507 
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,673
Little Chief.
 508 
00:43:23,715 --> 00:43:27,218
Gordo, lain't dreamin' here.
I talked to him. It was real.
 509 
00:43:28,594 --> 00:43:30,346
Little Chief!
 510 
00:43:30,429 --> 00:43:34,891
- John, what are you talkin' about?
- It was the ham radio.
 511 
00:43:34,975 --> 00:43:37,852
That's how come he didn't die.
 512 
00:43:37,936 --> 00:43:40,438
Little Chief!
 513 
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:50,029
That's how come he didn't die.
 514 
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:55,409
John. John Sullivan,
are you there?
 515 
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:57,494
Come on, answer me.
 516 
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:04,250
Chief. Chief, are you there?
 517 
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,710
I'm right here, Daddy.
 518 
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,838
Come here.
 519 
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:12,757
Come on.
 520 
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:19,054
- Where's Elvis?
- Sleepin'.
 521 
00:44:19,138 --> 00:44:21,557
- Sleepin'. Why aren't you sleepin'?
- You woke me up.
 522 
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,642
I did?
 523 
00:44:26,686 --> 00:44:30,481
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What's that?
 524 
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,861
All right, Chief.
 525 
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:39,906
What do you say
we tame this bronco, huh?
 526 
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:42,241
- I'm scared.
- I know.
 527 
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:44,410
And you know what?
 528 
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:48,413
I'm gonna be right here with you.
Always.
 529 
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,915
Daddy, I can't.
 530 
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:54,293
Well, we can.
We can do it together.
 531 
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:57,880
You and me, spirit and guts.
What do you say?
 532 
00:44:57,963 --> 00:45:00,257
- Okay.
- All right, come on.
 533 
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:07,555
Now you just take your time. I'm not
gonna let go until you say it's okay.
 534 
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,474
- Okay.
- All right? Start pedaling.
 535 
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:13,893
That's it. Get your balance.
 536 
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,688
- Ready? Okay, I'm still here.
- Wait.
 537 
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:18,231
- Okay!
- All right.
 538 
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:20,274
- It's all you.
- Look at me.
 539 
00:45:20,316 --> 00:45:23,026
It's all you.
It's all you, Chief.
 540 
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,029
- Look at me, Dad.
- Hey, look at you. You're doin' it.
 541 
00:45:26,112 --> 00:45:28,281
- I'm doin' it.
- You're doin' it.
 542 
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,324
I'm doin' it.
 543 
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:34,078
- How's it feel?
- Good.
 544 
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:35,954
- This is great.
- Look at your balance.
 545 
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:38,915
- Like I'm on a flying trapeze.
- You're like a circus act.
 546 
00:45:38,998 --> 00:45:41,167
- This feels great.
- You're goin' around the world.
 547 
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:43,919
- It's like flying.
- Wait till your mother sees this, huh?
 548 
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:47,965
- Look at me.
- Let's wake up the world, huh?
 549 
00:46:32,753 --> 00:46:33,921
Oh, my God.
 550 
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,293
Hello?
 551 
00:47:22,004 --> 00:47:27,801
- Hello?
-John? John Sullivan?
 552 
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:31,596
It's me.
 553 
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:44,482
You're the voice of an angel.
 554 
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:48,610
Reached right outta heaven
and you pulled my butt outta the fire.
 555 
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:54,365
Tell me I'm not dreamin' here.
Tell me it's really you.
 556 
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:59,286
lt's me, John.
This ain't no dream.
 557 
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,830
- But how could it be?
- I don't know. I don't know...
 558 
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:05,291
but we gotta be talkin' off
the mother sunspot of all time.
 559 
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,376
Yeah, l'd say so.
 560 
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:12,381
You okay, Chief?
 561 
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:16,301
Yeah, I'm fine.
 562 
00:48:16,384 --> 00:48:18,386
You sure?
 563 
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:25,434
It's tough to explain.
 564 
00:48:25,517 --> 00:48:30,313
I mean, I got all these new memories,
but I don't know what to believe.
 565 
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:32,398
What do you mean?
 566 
00:48:32,523 --> 00:48:35,693
'Cause I still remember what it was like
when you died in the fire.
 567 
00:48:35,776 --> 00:48:37,194
But l'm the only one.
 568 
00:48:38,445 --> 00:48:40,697
I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.
 569 
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:44,408
I remember both at the same time.
 570 
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:49,037
It-- It's like wakin' up from a dream,
and you're not sure what's real.
 571 
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:52,707
I remember you bein' here,
but I also remember when you weren't.
 572 
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:56,252
Oh, I'm sorry,John.
 573 
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:59,963
- I'm sorry. I never thought that--
- Well, you gotta think about that.
 574 
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:04,134
And you gotta be more careful,
'cause I can't lose you again.
 575 
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:05,718
Not like that.
 576 
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:10,639
You won't, John, you won't.
 577 
00:49:10,723 --> 00:49:13,392
I swear to God, no matter what,
not like that.
 578 
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:15,435
You got it? You hear me?
 579 
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:19,689
- You hear me, Chief?
- I hear you.
 580 
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:27,029
So how old are you?
 581 
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:32,992
- I'm 36.
- Thirty-six?
 582 
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:36,120
Well, you're all grown up.
 583 
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:38,538
You gotta be married
and everything.
 584 
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:41,583
No, I'm not married.
 585 
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:44,168
Why? What are you,
too busy playin' ball?
 586 
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:49,381
No, uh, it didn't work out.
I gave it up.
 587 
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:50,882
What happened?
 588 
00:49:50,966 --> 00:49:54,344
I just blew my arm out
my senior year...
 589 
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:57,096
and didn't have a shot.
 590 
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,642
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Johnny.
I know that had to hurt.
 591 
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:04,561
Yeah, thanks.
 592 
00:50:05,562 --> 00:50:08,439
So, what'd you wind up doing?
You join the department?
 593 
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:15,028
Actually, I went the other way.
I'm a cop.
 594 
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:18,448
You're third-generation firefighter.
 595 
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:20,992
Come on, I thought you were gonna
grow outta that cop phase.
 596 
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:23,244
Well, you got Satch to thank
for that one.
 597 
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:26,663
You gotta be kiddin' me, huh?
Satch?
 598 
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:30,792
Well, he always was crazy about you
ever since you were born.
 599 
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:38,840
You're still my Little Chief.
Right?
 600 
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:41,384
Right?
 601 
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:47,431
Yeah, I'm tryin' to be.
I'm tryin'.
 602 
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:52,644
Well, tell me about your self.
 603 
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:55,772
Tell me about your life.
 604 
00:50:55,855 --> 00:51:00,484
I mean, where do I start,
you know?
 605 
00:51:00,568 --> 00:51:03,904
Mustang?
I don't own a Mustang.
 606 
00:51:03,987 --> 00:51:06,573
Well, you will.
And you loved it.
 607 
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:08,324
- Fire-engine red.
- Yeah?
 608 
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:10,034
- Four on the floor.
- Seventy home runs?
 609 
00:51:10,117 --> 00:51:12,036
That's a record
that'll never be broken.
 610 
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:15,330
I wouldn't be too sure.
The other guy hit 66.
 611 
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:19,042
Really? You mean, like those
big field radios you use in the army?
 612 
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:22,086
No, much smaller.
Works off a satellite or something.
 613 
00:51:22,128 --> 00:51:23,963
You carry it around
in your pocket.
 614 
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:27,257
Hey, what about Apollo?
How'd it all work out?
 615 
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:29,843
It was a great Series, Pop.
Amazing.
 616 
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:32,804
- So we win, right?
- Hold your horses. I'm gettin' there.
 617 
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:36,599
Game three. Agee came through,
home red off Palmer in the second.
 618 
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:39,184
I knew it! I knew Agee
was gonna have a great Series.
 619 
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:42,437
Forget about Agee. Wait until you hear
what happened to Cleon Jones.
 620 
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,648
- You sound like your mother.
- Nah, I'm serious.
 621 
00:51:45,732 --> 00:51:48,901
Oh, come on. Your grandfather--
he smoked, what, two packs a day.
 622 
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:51,445
- He's still kickin'.
- Not you.
 623 
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,030
It's gonna get the better of you.
 624 
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:59,076
Okay?
 625 
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,622
Well, I just knew.
She melted my heart.
 626 
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:08,876
That was it.
You got anybody?
 627 
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,962
Yeah, kinda.
 628 
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,426
There's somethin'
I gotta work out, but...
 629 
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,511
she's worth it.
 630 
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,849
No, you, um, go ahead.
 631 
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:29,895
You, uh, get some rest.
I'm-- I'm tired too.
 632 
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:34,607
I almost don't wanna
click off here like...
 633 
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,692
maybe we won't get this back.
 634 
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:40,279
- We will.
- Okay.
 635 
00:52:42,822 --> 00:52:44,782
I'll be here tomorrow.
 636 
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:48,577
I know.
 637 
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:03,298
I love you, son.
 638 
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:07,552
I--
 639 
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:12,014
I love you, too, Dad.
 640 
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:13,599
I've--
 641 
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:17,311
I've missed you so much.
 642 
00:53:37,203 --> 00:53:41,248
Hi, this is Julia Sullivan.
Please leave a message after the tone.
 643 
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:46,044
Hey, Ma, it's me.
 644 
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:51,340
Just call me.
We gotta talk.
 645 
00:54:18,697 --> 00:54:21,199
- Take over for me?
- All right.
 646 
00:54:23,076 --> 00:54:26,037
- Frank, what's going on?
- Nothin'. Just wanted to see you.
 647 
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,621
Yeah?
 648 
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:33,668
I'm not goin' anywhere, Jules.
Not for the rest of your life.
 649 
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:36,671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
 650 
00:54:36,754 --> 00:54:38,672
I got a bad feeling today.
I was worried.
 651 
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:42,718
- Hmm? Look at me. Not a scratch.
- Where's Johnny?
 652 
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:45,553
He's at Gordo's.
I tucked him in.
 653 
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:49,598
- You give him his drops?
- One in each ear.
 654 
00:54:49,682 --> 00:54:51,141
What would you do without me?
 655 
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:55,729
Probably marry some rich doctor.
Never have to work.
 656 
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:58,606
Oh, my God. What is he doin'?
Frank, I gotta--
 657 
00:55:00,316 --> 00:55:02,068
Excuse me, Doctor.
Is that benazepril?
 658 
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:04,862
I gave this patient 50 mils of Benadryl
on admittance. Mix them, and he's dead.
 659 
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:08,114
- Why wasn't I made aware of this?
- It's in his chart.
 660 
00:57:28,152 --> 00:57:30,321
- Hello, Ma?
- Noah's Deli.
 661 
00:57:30,404 --> 00:57:32,364
I'm sorry.
 662 
00:57:41,038 --> 00:57:43,332
This is Noah's Deli.
 663 
00:58:00,722 --> 00:58:04,600
- Sam, I gotta talk to you.
- Excuse me?
 664 
00:58:04,683 --> 00:58:08,020
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gotta talk to you.
 665 
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:09,688
How do you know my name?
 666 
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:13,566
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
 667 
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,943
Look, I don't know you.
 668 
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:19,279
You don't know me?
What do you mean, you don't know me?
 669 
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:24,034
Wait. I do know you.
You're Linda and Gordo's friend.
 670 
00:58:24,117 --> 00:58:27,620
The neighbor, the cop.
What are you doin' here?
 671 
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:37,337
I shouldn't have come here.
 672 
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,674
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
 673 
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,930
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
 674 
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:18,664
- What?
- Another rough night?
 675 
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:22,292
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.
 676 
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:24,502
Do not disrespect me, John.
 677 
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:29,632
Disrespect yourself all you want to,
but not me or anybody else here.
 678 
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:31,258
Got that?
 679 
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:42,351
We got the preliminary for ensics
on the skeleton.
 680 
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:44,436
Take a look at this.
 681 
00:59:53,444 --> 00:59:54,945
Bad memories.
 682 
00:59:56,947 --> 01:00:01,284
Can you imagine the odds of digging
up a Nightingale murder?
 683 
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:04,370
- She makes ten.
- Ten?
 684 
01:00:04,453 --> 01:00:08,791
No. I remember this case.
It was three. He killed three women.
 685 
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:13,294
What are you talkin'?
You know better than anybody, John.
 686 
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:21,552
You looked through these files
a thousand times.
 687 
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:33,103
No.
 688 
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:00,585
Dad? You there?
 689 
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,921
Can you hear me?
 690 
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:07,383
Dad, I need you to be there.
 691 
01:01:07,424 --> 01:01:09,760
Yeah, Chief, I'm comin'.
 692 
01:01:09,843 --> 01:01:12,721
Listen, there's something
I need to t--
 693 
01:01:14,973 --> 01:01:16,265
Right here.
 694 
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,394
Chief?
 695 
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:22,980
Something happened.
Something pretty bad.
 696 
01:01:23,105 --> 01:01:25,273
What's the matter,Johnny?
 697 
01:01:25,357 --> 01:01:29,443
- Mom. Something happened to her.
- Your mom. What?
 698 
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:31,737
She's not here.
 699 
01:01:31,779 --> 01:01:34,573
What do you mean, she's not there?
 700 
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:40,662
She died. But it's like
it just happened though.
 701 
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:43,998
She died? Your mom just died?
 702 
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:49,085
No, Dad. It happened a long time ago.
A long time ago for me.
 703 
01:01:50,003 --> 01:01:51,462
When?
 704 
01:01:51,504 --> 01:01:55,466
October 22, 1969.
 705 
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:59,886
That's now, Johnny.
That's next week.
 706 
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:03,014
How? You gotta tell me how.
 707 
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:06,058
- She was murdered.
- What are you talking about?
 708 
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:08,727
Listen to me.
There was this case.
 709 
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:12,105
A serial. They never caught him,
but he murdered three women.
 710 
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:16,317
All nurses between '68 and '69.
They call him the Nightingale.
 711 
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:19,945
The Nightingale? We've been watching it
on the news. I was worried about it.
 712 
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:23,991
Dad, we did something.
Something to make it worse.
 713 
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,951
I don't understand.
 714 
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,620
He didn't just kill three women anymore.
He's killed ten.
 715 
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,747
Something we did changed the past.
 716 
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,833
- But how come your mother--
-Just think about it!
 717 
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,128
Everything you did is different than if
you hadn't gotten out of that warehouse.
 718 
01:02:38,169 --> 01:02:40,421
Now, what'd you do last night, Dad?
 719 
01:02:40,505 --> 01:02:44,758
I talked to you.
I put you on the bike.
 720 
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,679
I tucked you in at Gordo's. I went
to see your mother at the hospital.
 721 
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:53,933
Oh, shit! That's it.
She wasn't supposed to be there.
 722 
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:57,144
Butch went and got her because
that was the night of the fire.
 723 
01:02:57,228 --> 01:02:59,188
Something happened at that hospital?
 724 
01:02:59,229 --> 01:03:03,942
It could have been anywhere or time that
she wouldn't have been if you'd died.
 725 
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:07,528
I have to take her away from here.
 726 
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:09,947
- He cannot hurt her if I take her.
- What about the others?
 727 
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,492
- What about the others?
- I'll warn them.
 728 
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:15,577
They'll just think you're crazy.
 729 
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,163
I gotta do something. You don't
even know what this guy looks like.
 730 
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:22,207
- No, because-- No, but--
- You don't know who he is!
 731 
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:23,834
Wait a minute.
 732 
01:03:26,211 --> 01:03:28,671
Dad, I may not know who he is...
 733 
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:32,842
but I know where he's gonna to be and
what he's gonna do before he gets there.
 734 
01:03:32,925 --> 01:03:35,636
Do I call the police?
They won't believe me.
 735 
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:39,180
They will if they catch him in the act.
And you can make that happen.
 736 
01:03:39,264 --> 01:03:42,725
No, I don't know about--
I'm a firefighter.
 737 
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:46,395
I'm a cop! This is what I do!
This is something we have to do!
 738 
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:49,356
What if the ham stops working?
What if I can't reach you?
 739 
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:50,941
Then get Mom out.
 740 
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:54,819
But, Dad, those other women
were not supposed to die.
 741 
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:56,821
If we don't try and stop this guy...
 742 
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:59,907
we'll have to live with that
for the rest of our lives.
 743 
01:04:01,616 --> 01:04:05,703
- Okay. Tell me what to do.
-Allright.
 744 
01:04:05,828 --> 01:04:08,372
The next victim is Carrie Reynolds.
 745 
01:04:08,497 --> 01:04:12,751
It happens tomorrow. Case file says
she left Roosevelt Hospital at 6:00.
 746 
01:04:12,834 --> 01:04:15,003
Showed up at Cozy's Bar around 6:30.
 747 
01:04:15,086 --> 01:04:17,922
She walked out of that bar around 7..30.
 748 
01:04:18,006 --> 01:04:22,051
And they found her dead in an alley
behind the bar at 8..00.
 749 
01:04:22,134 --> 01:04:25,887
Follow her. See if anybody's
watching her or hitting on her.
 750 
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:30,725
l'm betting when she walks out of
that place, somebody'll go out with her.
 751 
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:33,853
When they do, you call the cops.
 752 
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,063
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi ya, Glen. How you doin'?
 753 
01:04:36,146 --> 01:04:37,606
Real good.
 754 
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:28,483
From the girls, pal.
All of them.
 755 
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:36,949
Thanks.
 756 
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:48,792
- Sit down.
- A fireman, huh?
 757 
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:52,045
- Yeah, I'm not really--
- Ah, a married fireman.
 758 
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:56,507
- Yeah.
- What the hell! What do they call you?
 759 
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,134
Frank.
 760 
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:05,724
7-4. Homicide.
 761 
01:06:05,807 --> 01:06:07,809
Yeah, it's me.
 762 
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:10,353
You're kiddin'.
 763 
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:15,232
Hold on. Spell that for me.
 764 
01:06:15,357 --> 01:06:18,568
Okay. Thanks, Mario.
 765 
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,822
Our lucky break.
Mario ID'd the dental.
 766 
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:28,326
Her name's Mary Finelli.
Reported missing April 16, 1968.
 767 
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:32,955
April 16?
That means she was the first.
 768 
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,749
Which means he probably knew her.
 769 
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,835
This case just got hot.
 770 
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:43,881
She's gone.
Carrie Reynolds isn't in here.
 771 
01:06:46,384 --> 01:06:48,135
Who?
 772 
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:52,013
He did it.
 773 
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,686
Carrie Reynolds
is alive and well, Dad.
 774 
01:06:58,728 --> 01:07:02,147
- I'll be damned.
- Did you see him?
 775 
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,233
- Figure who he is?
- No, I messed up.
 776 
01:07:05,317 --> 01:07:08,027
I kept talking to her.
I was afraid to let her out of my sight.
 777 
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:10,112
Who ever it was,
he must've backed off.
 778 
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:13,407
That's okay. We're gonna get him.
This is gonna work.
 779 
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:16,076
I hope so.
 780 
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:18,912
- What else you got?
- We caught a break.
 781 
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:21,539
Found his first victim.
 782 
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,582
Her name is Mary Finelli.
 783 
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,668
Hang on a sec, John.
 784 
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:30,088
Jules, there's somebody
I want you to talk to, okay?
 785 
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,715
Remember I told you
about this guy John?
 786 
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,884
I want you to say hello to him.
 787 
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:39,263
John, say hello to my wife, Julia.
 788 
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:44,434
Hi, John.
 789 
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,727
Frank tells me you're a cop.
 790 
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:48,521
Yeah, that's right.
 791 
01:07:48,604 --> 01:07:52,482
My six-year-old keeps telling us
he wants to be a policeman...
 792 
01:07:52,566 --> 01:07:54,567
right after he retires
from the majors.
 793 
01:07:55,652 --> 01:07:58,362
We bought him a badge and whistle
for his birthday.
 794 
01:07:58,446 --> 01:08:01,407
I remember.
I used to play cops and robbers...
 795 
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:04,284
but you-- my mom wouldn't let me
have a toy gun.
 796 
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:08,371
Sounds like your mom and I
would get along.
 797 
01:08:08,454 --> 01:08:11,916
Yeah, she's pretty special.
l'm real proud of her.
 798 
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:15,544
Bet she's proud of you, too,
being a cop and all.
 799 
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:21,299
I hope so. I hope she knows
how much I love her.
 800 
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:25,886
Oh, she knows. Moms always know
how much their kids love them.
 801 
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:29,306
Even if they don't tell them
all the time like they should.
 802 
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:35,394
Well, I gotta go.
It was good talking to you, John.
 803 
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,771
Yeah, you too.
 804 
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,815
- I wanna talk on Daddy's radio.
- Okay, Chief, go ahead.
 805 
01:08:39,857 --> 01:08:43,193
- Sweet heart, say good night to John.
- Good night, John.
 806 
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,822
Good night there, Chief.
 807 
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:51,450
Okay, guys. Bedtime.
 808 
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:53,618
No, I wanna talk on the radio, too.
 809 
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,789
-Allright, Gordo, come here.
- Gordo, two minutes, then bedtime.
 810 
01:08:57,872 --> 01:09:00,875
Sit right there.
Press there.
 811 
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:04,836
This is the space cowboy.
 812 
01:09:04,878 --> 01:09:08,882
l'm an intergalactic traveler
from the federation planet Earth.
 813 
01:09:09,007 --> 01:09:12,301
- Gordo?
- How do you know my name, mister?
 814 
01:09:15,596 --> 01:09:17,514
Listen, Gordo...
 815 
01:09:17,597 --> 01:09:19,641
my name is Santa Claus.
 816 
01:09:19,724 --> 01:09:23,519
And I'm going to give you the
biggest Christmas present you ever had.
 817 
01:09:24,687 --> 01:09:26,814
I better give you my address then.
 818 
01:09:26,897 --> 01:09:30,150
No, don't worry about it.
Now, this is important.
 819 
01:09:30,192 --> 01:09:34,195
Something you got to remember
for a long time. Yahoo.
 820 
01:09:35,196 --> 01:09:36,405
What's that?
 821 
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,782
lt's a magic word. lt's like--
 822 
01:09:38,866 --> 01:09:44,537
lt's like abra cadabra, but even better.
Try it out, kid. Yahoo.
 823 
01:09:45,288 --> 01:09:47,832
- Yahoo.
- You got it, space cowboy.
 824 
01:09:47,915 --> 01:09:50,000
Gordo, your two minutes are up.
 825 
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:53,503
- Now go upstairs and write it down.
- Okay, mister.
 826 
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:55,672
- I mean, Santa.
- Come on.
 827 
01:09:55,755 --> 01:10:00,009
Let's go. Stay there, John.
I'll be right back. Upstairs.
 828 
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:04,429
Jules, got a live one down here
coming your way.
 829 
01:10:05,472 --> 01:10:06,598
Yeah, Chief?
 830 
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:09,058
You still there?
 831 
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:12,603
- What do we do now?
- Okay, Sissy Clark.
 832 
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:16,482
- 423 Greenwich Street.
- Hang on, hang on. Go ahead.
 833 
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:21,402
Sissy Clark, 423 Greenwich Street,
apartment 2E, tomorrow.
 834 
01:10:21,486 --> 01:10:23,780
- Okay, 2E.
- Nurse.
 835 
01:10:23,863 --> 01:10:29,034
Moonlights as a cocktail waitress
at the Kaleidoscope on West 63rd.
 836 
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:31,745
Left work at 2 a.m...
 837 
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:35,832
was killed in her apartment
between 2:15 and 5:00.
 838 
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,417
Okay, I got it.
 839 
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:42,254
Dad, I don't know how long
this thing is gonna keep workin '.
 840 
01:10:42,379 --> 01:10:46,216
Or if we'll be able to talk again.
Just be careful.
 841 
01:11:21,663 --> 01:11:24,332
I'm happy you found her, Detective.
 842 
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:29,586
It makes it easier now,
to know for sure.
 843 
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:32,255
You know.
 844 
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,925
Can I keep these for a while?
 845 
01:11:38,302 --> 01:11:42,055
Okay, just let me walk you through it.
 846 
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:44,099
I'm all ears.
 847 
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,352
Three guys show up
in both the year book and diary.
 848 
01:11:49,895 --> 01:11:52,856
First guy passed away ten years ago.
 849 
01:11:53,982 --> 01:11:55,984
Second guy died in Vietnam.
 850 
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,696
And the third one is Daryl Simpson.
 851 
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:03,491
So I ran him through BCI.
Got a hit.
 852 
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:08,161
Busted for sexual assault eight days
after the last Nightingale murder.
 853 
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:09,996
March 22, 1970.
 854 
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,207
So the murders stopped because
he was off the street...
 855 
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:17,920
and by the time he got paroled he had
smartened up enough to control himself?
 856 
01:12:18,003 --> 01:12:20,130
That's not the first time
that's been true.
 857 
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:23,967
I got a feeling about this guy.
This is him, Satch.
 858 
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:50,156
- Can I get you another one?
- No thanks, I'm good.
 859 
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:54,201
Anything else?
 860 
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:57,662
Sexual assault, Daryl.
Five years.
 861 
01:12:57,704 --> 01:13:01,666
But you got lucky, right?
You got away with something else.
 862 
01:13:01,707 --> 01:13:04,043
Something you figured
nobody knows about.
 863 
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:06,045
What I know is what I told you.
 864 
01:13:06,086 --> 01:13:09,047
Let me tell you what I know.
You went to Saint Ambrose with Mary.
 865 
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:12,759
You lived five blocks from her.
You liked her, but she ain't interested.
 866 
01:13:12,842 --> 01:13:15,845
- That must've hurt, huh?
- So what?
 867 
01:13:15,928 --> 01:13:18,555
- So, what'd you do about it?
- Nothing!
 868 
01:13:26,812 --> 01:13:28,856
Spare a smoke?
 869 
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:30,232
Yeah.
 870 
01:13:30,357 --> 01:13:32,984
Here, I'm trying to quit.
 871 
01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:38,281
Oh, my God!
 872 
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:40,616
What is this?
 873 
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:42,659
Jesus! Jesus!
 874 
01:13:42,743 --> 01:13:46,079
- Get that away from me!
- Sandra Moore. Patty Ryan.
 875 
01:13:46,162 --> 01:13:49,082
Mary Finelli. These names
mean anything to you?
 876 
01:13:49,123 --> 01:13:51,500
Julia Sullivan.
Does she mean anything?
 877 
01:13:51,584 --> 01:13:54,628
Well, she means something to me!
 878 
01:14:06,138 --> 01:14:09,433
See ya, fireman.
Don't talk so much next time.
 879 
01:14:09,516 --> 01:14:11,976
Will you run my tips
while I go change?
 880 
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:13,936
Thanks.
 881 
01:14:31,326 --> 01:14:33,620
You know, Daryl...
 882 
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:36,873
sometimes, despite all the training
we cops go through...
 883 
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,377
despite all that we are taught
about right and wrong...
 884 
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:46,256
despite all that we would like
to honor in ourselves...
 885 
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:48,425
we can come to a place...
 886 
01:14:49,259 --> 01:14:51,260
where we don't give a damn.
 887 
01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:54,346
Know what lmean?
 888 
01:14:55,222 --> 01:14:57,432
You'll tell me everything
I need to know now.
 889 
01:14:59,643 --> 01:15:01,352
You got a minute?
 890 
01:15:01,436 --> 01:15:04,605
Yeah, sure.
 891 
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:13,821
He ain't the guy, John.
 892 
01:15:13,863 --> 01:15:18,117
Because he didn't want to look at the
photos? Not everyone fits the profile.
 893 
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:21,662
If he was gonna give up something,
he would've done it already.
 894 
01:15:34,089 --> 01:15:35,715
You following me?
 895 
01:15:35,799 --> 01:15:37,842
You following me?
 896 
01:15:40,261 --> 01:15:43,264
I asked you a question, asshole.
 897 
01:15:43,347 --> 01:15:44,807
Mary Finelli.
 898 
01:16:14,332 --> 01:16:16,876
Whoa, dude!
What happened to him?
 899 
01:16:17,001 --> 01:16:22,506
It was a bad trip, man. A little time
kissing the porcelain, he'll be fine.
 900 
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:24,966
- I understand that.
- All right, come on, pal.
 901 
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:19,930
Open up!
Miss Clark! Open the door!
 902 
01:17:20,014 --> 01:17:22,182
It's the police! Open the door!
 903 
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:25,518
It's okay, ma'am. Go back inside.
It's the police.
 904 
01:17:25,602 --> 01:17:29,230
Are you in there? Open up!
I know you're in there!
 905 
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:34,902
Sissy Clark! Open the door!
Open the door!
 906 
01:18:22,484 --> 01:18:25,320
He killed her.
 907 
01:18:25,403 --> 01:18:27,489
I couldn't do a damn thing
to stop it.
 908 
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:30,700
- lt's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
 909 
01:18:30,825 --> 01:18:33,077
We changed everything, Johnny.
 910 
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,038
- It's like we cheated.
- Dad, we can't go back.
 911 
01:18:37,122 --> 01:18:39,124
'Cause you didn't die
in that fire.
 912 
01:18:39,207 --> 01:18:41,667
No matter what you do,
nothing is going to change it.
 913 
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:45,004
So all we can do is deal with this
and try to make it right.
 914 
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:48,840
- I'm not a cop. I'm not fooling anyone.
- I know, but we can.
 915 
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:52,343
We can do it together.
Remember spirit and guts?
 916 
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:56,347
He's got my driver's license.
 917 
01:18:57,014 --> 01:18:58,182
What?
 918 
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:01,435
He took my driver's license.
He knows where we live.
 919 
01:19:01,518 --> 01:19:04,437
He took your--
He took your wallet?
 920 
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,064
Well, he tossed the wallet,
but he kept the license.
 921 
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:09,817
- He touched your wallet? Where is it?
- In my pocket.
 922 
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:11,944
- We got him, Dad. You got him.
- What?
 923 
01:19:12,027 --> 01:19:16,030
You got his prints. Listen,
you gotta get me that wallet.
 924 
01:19:16,114 --> 01:19:20,117
- How the hell am I supposed to do that?
-As carefully as possible.
 925 
01:19:20,201 --> 01:19:23,287
- Take your wallet out by the corners.
- What are you talking about?
 926 
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,455
- Dad, just do it.
-Allright.
 927 
01:19:25,539 --> 01:19:29,292
All right. Right. Okay.
I got it.
 928 
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:30,960
Allright, listen.
 929 
01:19:31,043 --> 01:19:33,170
I want you to wrap it up.
 930 
01:19:33,212 --> 01:19:36,923
Put it in one of them plastic bags
you keep the extra transistors in.
 931 
01:19:37,049 --> 01:19:38,800
I see where you're going!
 932 
01:19:38,883 --> 01:19:42,011
Beautiful. Now, l want you
to hide it somewhere.
 933 
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:46,473
Somewhere where nobody's
gonna find it for the next 30 years.
 934 
01:19:46,557 --> 01:19:48,350
- I think maybe--
- Where?
 935 
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:50,852
The window seat in the dining room.
 936 
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:53,730
There's a loose board on the left,
on the bottom.
 937 
01:19:53,813 --> 01:19:55,648
Perfect! Beautiful!
 938 
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:13,705
It's in!
 939 
01:20:13,747 --> 01:20:16,124
Great! Okay, l'm after it.
 940 
01:20:27,425 --> 01:20:30,803
We're in business!
Now just sit tight and don't worry.
 941 
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:04,082
And the winner is--
 942 
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:08,878
Oh, man. It's a cop.
 943 
01:21:08,961 --> 01:21:10,462
What the hell?
 944 
01:21:19,053 --> 01:21:21,389
Son of a bitch.
 945 
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:38,445
Hey, Mr. Shepard. How are you?
 946 
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:40,947
Who's that?
Oh, hi, Detective.
 947 
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:44,242
I came by to wrap things up over there.
Thought I'd say hello.
 948 
01:21:44,325 --> 01:21:47,369
I'm glad you did.
Come on in.
 949 
01:21:47,453 --> 01:21:48,954
Thank you.
 950 
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:54,626
- Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Sure.
 951 
01:21:55,418 --> 01:21:59,129
- Black? Sugar? Milk?
- Oh, you know. It's all good.
 952 
01:21:59,213 --> 01:22:00,547
You'll get black.
 953 
01:22:06,052 --> 01:22:07,220
Fresh pot.
 954 
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,307
- You know Jack?
- Not really.
 955 
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,350
He's still on the job?
 956 
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:17,062
He does a little P.I.,
but he's mostly retired.
 957 
01:22:18,354 --> 01:22:20,398
Living off his pension, huh?
 958 
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:25,861
Jack got caught up
in them knapp hearings.
 959 
01:22:25,986 --> 01:22:29,656
Set up by some dirty cops
who needed a fall guy.
 960 
01:22:29,698 --> 01:22:32,241
Hurt him bad.
Would've broke his mother's heart.
 961 
01:22:32,325 --> 01:22:34,744
- Is she around?
- Who?
 962 
01:22:34,827 --> 01:22:39,081
- Your wife.
- No. She passed on a long time ago.
 963 
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,501
Long time ago.
 964 
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:53,218
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.
 965 
01:22:59,223 --> 01:23:01,642
Can I ask you how she died?
 966 
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:09,440
Well, she--
 967 
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:13,193
She was murdered.
 968 
01:23:14,069 --> 01:23:16,571
An ugly one, to tell you the truth.
 969 
01:23:17,447 --> 01:23:20,783
Mother of a cop, and they never found
the bastard who did it.
 970 
01:23:56,147 --> 01:23:57,648
You on the job?
 971 
01:24:01,902 --> 01:24:03,862
A long time ago.
 972 
01:24:04,863 --> 01:24:07,407
- Do I know you?
- I look familiar?
 973 
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,785
- What house you work?
- The 7-4. Homicide.
 974 
01:24:10,826 --> 01:24:13,078
Mmm, a hot shot.
 975 
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,957
- No, just working the job.
- Yeah, I hear that, pal.
 976 
01:24:16,998 --> 01:24:21,461
As a matter of fact, I caught a case
that goes back to your day.
 977 
01:24:21,544 --> 01:24:23,462
One of  the Nightingale murders.
 978 
01:24:24,463 --> 01:24:27,090
- No kidding?
- No. Missing teenager.
 979 
01:24:27,132 --> 01:24:31,428
Disappeared back in '68.
We found her bones last week...
 980 
01:24:31,469 --> 01:24:34,805
buried behind some old diner
out by Dyckman Street.
 981 
01:24:34,847 --> 01:24:37,891
Mary Finelli.
Talk about dumb luck!
 982 
01:24:37,975 --> 01:24:42,729
The odds of finding that girl 30 years
later and of hitting a dental--
 983 
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:44,564
Forget about it.
 984 
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,941
The best part is,
she's the first victim.
 985 
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:50,194
And she knew the killer, so...
 986 
01:24:50,277 --> 01:24:53,613
I'm betting those old bones
are gonna do a lot of talking.
 987 
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:59,952
But not for nothing.
The past is a funny thing.
 988 
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,121
We all have skeletons in the closet.
 989 
01:25:02,162 --> 01:25:04,998
You never know when they're going
to pop up and bite you in the ass.
 990 
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,208
Huh,Jack?
 991 
01:25:10,753 --> 01:25:12,797
You changed your M.O.
 992 
01:25:12,922 --> 01:25:16,675
If they knew your mom was a Nightingale,
they would've looked at the family.
 993 
01:25:17,426 --> 01:25:20,345
They would've looked at you.
 994 
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,975
And what are you lookin' at?
 995 
01:25:27,017 --> 01:25:29,770
Stealin' your life away.
 996 
01:25:29,853 --> 01:25:32,480
You went down 30 years ago, pal.
 997 
01:25:32,522 --> 01:25:34,857
You just don't know it yet.
 998 
01:26:00,713 --> 01:26:05,133
A cop? He's a cop? What the hell
am I supposed to do with that?
 999 
01:26:05,217 --> 01:26:07,344
Call the FBI. Use a payphone.
 1000 
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:09,512
Don't give him your name, Dad.
 1001 
01:26:09,596 --> 01:26:14,058
Say Shepard killed Finelli, Clark and
the others. That he's the Nightingale.
 1002 
01:26:14,141 --> 01:26:18,061
Say where Finelli's body's buried.
They'll connect him to her.
 1003 
01:26:18,145 --> 01:26:20,397
- Frank here?
- They'll search his place.
 1004 
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,608
They'll find some souvenirs. He always
took a piece of his victims' jewelry.
 1005 
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:25,943
- Satch.
- Hey, Frank.
 1006 
01:26:29,404 --> 01:26:33,032
- What are you doing here? Are you off?
- We need to talk.
 1007 
01:26:33,116 --> 01:26:35,201
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec, John.
 1008 
01:26:35,284 --> 01:26:40,039
I'm in the middle of something important
here. Mind if we do this--
 1009 
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:44,542
l'm sorry, Frank, but we need
to step outside right now.
 1010 
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:45,793
What's happening?
 1011 
01:26:45,877 --> 01:26:49,755
John, Satch is here.
 1012 
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,924
- He's with his partner.
- What's going on?
 1013 
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,259
Hang on a sec.
 1014 
01:26:54,301 --> 01:26:57,345
- What's your partner doing here?
- What happened to your eye?
 1015 
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,764
Banged it up.
 1016 
01:26:59,806 --> 01:27:01,557
Let's talk outside.
 1017 
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,726
- We need to do that.
- About what?
 1018 
01:27:03,809 --> 01:27:07,020
- Let's go. Do us both a favor.
- All right.
 1019 
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,275
Stay there. I'll be back.
 1020 
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:17,446
Be right back, all right?
 1021 
01:27:30,165 --> 01:27:32,459
So where were you last night, Frank?
 1022 
01:27:34,294 --> 01:27:36,838
Where do you think I was, Satch?
 1023 
01:27:37,797 --> 01:27:39,798
Same place I found this.
 1024 
01:27:41,508 --> 01:27:43,718
Under the body of a dead woman.
 1025 
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:50,516
No, this isn't what you think.
 1026 
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,976
- This isn't what you think.
- I want to be wrong.
 1027 
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:57,105
So let's take a ride down
to the precinct and talk about it.
 1028 
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:01,192
- Yeah, I need to talk to you, too.
- Come on, we'll take a ride.
 1029 
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:03,819
All right. Let me tell my family
where I'm going.
 1030 
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:06,238
All right? Be right back.
 1031 
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:11,201
It's all right.
Don't worry.
 1032 
01:28:18,373 --> 01:28:20,333
- Chief, you there?
- Yeah.
 1033 
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:22,710
They found Sissy Clark.
They think that I did it.
 1034 
01:28:22,794 --> 01:28:25,546
- Frank.
- Give me a second.
 1035 
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:28,048
Don't do this!
 1036 
01:28:28,132 --> 01:28:30,884
- What's going on?
- Uncle Satch, don't!
 1037 
01:28:31,009 --> 01:28:33,011
What's going on?
 1038 
01:29:03,621 --> 01:29:05,039
He's a cop.
 1039 
01:29:05,122 --> 01:29:07,666
A cop.
 1040 
01:29:09,626 --> 01:29:11,586
Jack Shepard.
 1041 
01:29:11,711 --> 01:29:14,005
He's a detective in the 15th precinct.
 1042 
01:29:14,046 --> 01:29:15,965
I swear, Satch.
 1043 
01:29:16,048 --> 01:29:20,635
And you got all this from the guy on
the radio, from your son in the future.
 1044 
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,805
Yeah. As nuts as that sounds, yeah.
 1045 
01:29:28,225 --> 01:29:32,562
You've gotta listen to me, open up your
mind and try to understand what I say.
 1046 
01:29:32,646 --> 01:29:36,024
You got something going on
with this girl, that's one thing.
 1047 
01:29:36,065 --> 01:29:38,651
But you gotta tell me.
 1048 
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:43,739
Are you listening to me?
You're in a world of shit!
 1049 
01:29:43,822 --> 01:29:47,075
An eyewitness puts you outside
the dead girl's apartment.
 1050 
01:29:47,158 --> 01:29:51,329
Your prints are all over the place,
not to mention the license.
 1051 
01:29:51,412 --> 01:29:54,039
Chuck is getting a search warrant
for your house.
 1052 
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:57,709
- What's he going to find, huh?
- Nothing.
 1053 
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,503
Give me something,
something I can believe.
 1054 
01:30:05,382 --> 01:30:08,552
lt's number five for Dave McNally.
 1055 
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:11,429
Two Mets are out in the fifth inning.
 1056 
01:30:11,554 --> 01:30:13,848
What if I can prove it to you?
 1057 
01:30:13,931 --> 01:30:16,058
How's that?
 1058 
01:30:16,142 --> 01:30:19,103
World Series. Where are they
right now? What? Fifth inning?
 1059 
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:22,939
What if I were to tell you...
 1060 
01:30:23,023 --> 01:30:25,608
that in the bottom
of the sixth inning...
 1061 
01:30:25,692 --> 01:30:28,402
the Mets are gonna be down three-zip?
 1062 
01:30:28,444 --> 01:30:30,654
Cleon Jones is gonna come to bat.
 1063 
01:30:30,738 --> 01:30:32,656
He's going to get hit...
 1064 
01:30:32,739 --> 01:30:36,242
in the foot by a wild pitch.
 1065 
01:30:36,326 --> 01:30:38,911
It's gonna leave a shoe polish mark
on the ball.
 1066 
01:30:38,953 --> 01:30:41,372
Hear me out!
Hear me out, all right?
 1067 
01:30:41,455 --> 01:30:44,750
He goes to first.
Clende non comes up.
 1068 
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,794
He's gonna hit a two-two pitch
into the left field bleachers.
 1069 
01:30:47,877 --> 01:30:49,504
This is insane.
 1070 
01:30:49,629 --> 01:30:52,882
In the bottom ofthe seventh,
Weis is gonna hit a solo home run...
 1071 
01:30:52,965 --> 01:30:55,801
and Jones and Swoboda
are gonna score in the eighth.
 1072 
01:30:55,843 --> 01:30:57,969
The Mets are gonna win that game,
five to three.
 1073 
01:30:58,053 --> 01:31:00,221
Go watch that game.
If it don't happen, I'm a liar.
 1074 
01:31:00,305 --> 01:31:02,932
- Go watch the game?
- Yeah, watch the game!
 1075 
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:07,978
Frank, they're gonna make you
for Sissy Clark's murder!
 1076 
01:31:08,061 --> 01:31:10,856
And they're gonna match that
with the Nightingale murders.
 1077 
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:14,692
Do you understand what that means?
 1078 
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:19,238
His wife is here.
She wants to talk to you.
 1079 
01:32:02,692 --> 01:32:06,070
Let's walk, Jules.
Get a cup of coffee.
 1080 
01:32:30,716 --> 01:32:32,593
How you doin'?
 1081 
01:32:32,676 --> 01:32:35,345
You got a collar in here
for the Nightingale murders?
 1082 
01:32:35,428 --> 01:32:37,305
Yeah.
 1083 
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:53,152
Everything okay with you and Frank?
 1084 
01:32:53,236 --> 01:32:57,364
Yeah, we're good. He works hard.
I work hard. We're good.
 1085 
01:32:57,447 --> 01:32:59,741
Who's Sissy Clark, Satch?
 1086 
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:07,039
Do you know where Frank was
last night?
 1087 
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:09,791
Yeah, he was working. He had a tour.
 1088 
01:33:37,065 --> 01:33:39,108
Sit down.
 1089 
01:33:42,111 --> 01:33:44,196
Did you hear what I said?
 1090 
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:58,250
So how'd you know?
 1091 
01:33:59,626 --> 01:34:01,586
- Hey, this guy tried--
- How you doin'?
 1092 
01:34:01,628 --> 01:34:02,879
What's happening?
 1093 
01:34:02,962 --> 01:34:05,631
Shut up, asshole.
Mind if we take this outside?
 1094 
01:34:05,756 --> 01:34:10,761
He's trying to kill me.
Find Satch! He's trying to kill me.
 1095 
01:34:13,638 --> 01:34:16,474
What are you doing with my collar?
 1096 
01:34:18,726 --> 01:34:21,603
Listen, I'm sorry, pal.
I didn't mean to step on your toes.
 1097 
01:34:21,645 --> 01:34:24,481
They sent me from downstairs.
I thought you'd be with him.
 1098 
01:34:24,564 --> 01:34:26,900
What are you looking at him for?
 1099 
01:34:26,983 --> 01:34:31,529
He matches a description
of an armed robbery suspect.
 1100 
01:34:31,612 --> 01:34:33,864
So tell me about the radio.
 1101 
01:34:33,947 --> 01:34:36,033
Who's he talking to on that thing?
 1102 
01:34:36,116 --> 01:34:38,451
John. He's a cop.
 1103 
01:34:38,535 --> 01:34:41,329
He talks to him all the time.
I've talked to him, too.
 1104 
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:47,626
- You talk to Johnny on the radio?
- Yeah. John. What's going on?
 1105 
01:34:47,668 --> 01:34:52,005
You come and take Frank and now
you're talking to me like a cop.
 1106 
01:34:54,507 --> 01:34:56,884
I'm talking to you as a friend.
 1107 
01:34:56,967 --> 01:35:01,012
'Cause as a cop
I wouldn't be here at all.
 1108 
01:35:03,765 --> 01:35:05,350
Listen, Jules...
 1109 
01:35:06,684 --> 01:35:08,686
they're gonna take me
off this case.
 1110 
01:35:08,727 --> 01:35:12,522
And then Frank is gonna tell them
what he's been tellin' me.
 1111 
01:35:14,316 --> 01:35:18,528
And then nobody is gonna
be able to help him. Okay?
 1112 
01:35:18,611 --> 01:35:20,863
Cleon Jones makes the catch.
 1113 
01:35:23,532 --> 01:35:27,786
Half the uniforms are at the game.
It'll be a riot if they pull it off.
 1114 
01:35:27,869 --> 01:35:29,829
What is he telling you?
 1115 
01:35:31,122 --> 01:35:35,250
That he's talking to Johnny
on the radio.
 1116 
01:35:35,334 --> 01:35:37,711
Yeah. John, the cop.
I told you that.
 1117 
01:35:37,794 --> 01:35:41,005
No, he says that John...
 1118 
01:35:41,089 --> 01:35:44,341
is your son, Johnny, little Johnny...
 1119 
01:35:44,467 --> 01:35:46,927
on the radio in the future.
 1120 
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:48,970
On the radio. You see?
 1121 
01:35:51,681 --> 01:35:54,809
No. You mis understood him.
 1122 
01:36:11,949 --> 01:36:14,493
- Sissy Clark?
- Yeah.
 1123 
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:18,538
She's a nurse.
And she was murdered yesterday.
 1124 
01:36:20,706 --> 01:36:23,083
And Frank is connected.
 1125 
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:27,545
He is either a material witness
or accomplice or the perpetrator.
 1126 
01:36:31,841 --> 01:36:34,551
McNally, who's been thoroughly
in command.
 1127 
01:36:41,057 --> 01:36:45,144
Cleon starts down to first base,
and DeMiro calls him back.
 1128 
01:36:49,189 --> 01:36:52,484
Satch, you know he didn 't do this.
Right?
 1129 
01:36:52,609 --> 01:36:54,861
Carrying the baseball,
he's coming overnow.
 1130 
01:36:54,944 --> 01:36:58,405
- Hodges showing the baseball to DeMiro.
- Can I see him?
 1131 
01:36:58,489 --> 01:37:01,158
Hodges-- We might have
a shoepolish play here.
 1132 
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:04,369
Remember the Nippy Jones shoe polish
play in the 1957 World Series...
 1133 
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:05,912
at Milwaukee?
 1134 
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:11,417
Hodges showing it to DeMiro,
who awards first base!
 1135 
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:16,421
My God.
 1136 
01:37:17,839 --> 01:37:19,841
Satch, what's going on?
 1137 
01:37:21,592 --> 01:37:24,595
Mind if I go back at the fireboy?
I wanna see what he's got.
 1138 
01:37:25,596 --> 01:37:27,055
Jesus.
 1139 
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:51,284
It's out down here!
 1140 
01:43:57,434 --> 01:43:59,394
Hey, bud.
 1141 
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:19,953
Go ahead.
 1142 
01:44:20,036 --> 01:44:23,039
See if aviation's got a helicopter...
 1143 
01:44:23,122 --> 01:44:27,543
for commencing an airsearch
for body in water.
 1144 
01:44:54,191 --> 01:44:59,529
It was a season and World Series for the
ages for the Mets and MVP Don Clenden on.
 1145 
01:45:00,863 --> 01:45:04,783
For the Mets faithful,
the New York fans, wow!
 1146 
01:45:20,005 --> 01:45:22,257
Here's your coffee and cigarettes.
 1147 
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:35,310
I'll be upstairs.
 1148 
01:45:37,645 --> 01:45:42,775
lncredible sun storm has created
a remarkable aurora borealis.
 1149 
01:45:42,858 --> 01:45:47,987
A cold front, and the aurora is already
dimming and will be overby morning.
 1150 
01:46:24,769 --> 01:46:28,397
John, are you there?
John, l'm back.
 1151 
01:46:29,148 --> 01:46:32,234
-John, are you there?
- I'm here, Dad.
 1152 
01:46:32,317 --> 01:46:34,319
- We did it, son.
- What?
 1153 
01:46:34,402 --> 01:46:36,321
- We stopped him.
- We did?
 1154 
01:46:36,404 --> 01:46:38,156
Yeah.
 1155 
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:40,658
There's something-- Something's wrong.
I don't--
 1156 
01:46:41,951 --> 01:46:43,285
What's wrong?
 1157 
01:46:44,745 --> 01:46:47,872
If we stopped him,
why isn't Mom here?
 1158 
01:46:47,956 --> 01:46:51,751
Why don't I remember her being okay?
 1159 
01:46:51,834 --> 01:46:55,045
But I killed him. He's dead.
 1160 
01:47:00,967 --> 01:47:02,718
My turn to steal...
 1161 
01:47:02,802 --> 01:47:04,929
your life away.
 1162 
01:47:05,012 --> 01:47:07,097
John? Johnny, you there?
 1163 
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:50,051
Hey, bud.
 1164 
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:14,364
Julia!
 1165 
01:48:34,798 --> 01:48:36,049
Mommy?
 1166 
01:48:36,132 --> 01:48:37,175
No!
 1167 
01:48:46,516 --> 01:48:47,851
Hey, Johnny.
 1168 
01:49:00,862 --> 01:49:03,031
It's okay, it's okay.
 1169 
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:09,703
What are you gonna do, Frank?
Put the gun down.
 1170 
01:49:09,828 --> 01:49:11,955
Let him go!
 1171 
01:49:12,038 --> 01:49:13,790
You put the gun down.
 1172 
01:49:18,544 --> 01:49:21,505
I'll snap his neck.
Put the gun down now.
 1173 
01:49:34,224 --> 01:49:38,228
Time to die, Sullivan.
Time to die.
 1174 
01:49:39,854 --> 01:49:41,731
Run, Johnny, run, run, run!
 1175 
01:49:41,772 --> 01:49:43,774
Run!
 1176 
01:50:00,372 --> 01:50:02,290
Come here. You all right?
 1177 
01:50:02,373 --> 01:50:04,917
You all right?
 1178 
01:50:53,167 --> 01:50:55,169
I'm still here, Chief.
 1179 
01:51:34,244 --> 01:51:36,705
'Round the horn, 'round the horn.
 1180 
01:51:44,045 --> 01:51:45,462
Come on, new batter,
new batter, new batter!
 1181 
01:51:45,546 --> 01:51:47,131
Come on, Frank!
 1182 
01:51:49,549 --> 01:51:53,011
The Benz! Not the Benz!
 1183 
01:51:58,223 --> 01:52:00,684
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
 1184 
01:52:02,686 --> 01:52:04,145
Nice hittin', Frank.
 1185 
01:52:04,229 --> 01:52:06,189
Way to go.
 1186 
01:52:06,272 --> 01:52:08,274
Thank you very much.
 1187 
01:52:10,901 --> 01:52:13,403
Let's play some ball.
 1188 
01:52:13,487 --> 01:52:15,572
Come on.
New batter, new batter, new batter.
 1189 
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:20,868
Go get it!
He's slow! He's old!
 1190 
01:52:26,581 --> 01:52:28,875
- Come on, Johnny.
- Bring me home, Chief.
 1191 
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:29,000
