WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:03.467
- THEY BOUGHT A CONDOMINIUM
IN NEW JERSEY:

00:03.467 --> 00:05.333
THE GARDEN STATE VILLAS.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.067
- WE WANT TO MOVE THERE.

00:09.667 --> 00:10.767
- WE GET THE HOUSE.

00:10.767 --> 00:11.767
- [gasps]
WHAT?

00:11.767 --> 00:13.200
- OUR OWN HOUSE!

00:13.200 --> 00:15.233
- GOODBYE.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.500
[party horn toots]

00:22.333 --> 00:23.400
[knock on door]

00:24.733 --> 00:26.700
- HI.
- OH.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.000
OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.333
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.767
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.633
THIRD TIME IN TWO WEEKS, MA.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.333
- ONLY THE THIRD TIME.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.533
COME IN.
SIT DOWN.

00:38.533 --> 00:41.433
YOUR FATHER'S JUST ON HIS WAY
BACK FROM THE DINING HALL.

00:41.433 --> 00:42.333
- OH.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.167
WHAT DO YOU DO,
HOSE HIM OFF AND SEND HIM BACK?

00:44.167 --> 00:45.800
- [chuckles]

00:45.800 --> 00:47.533
- OH, BOY.

00:47.533 --> 00:48.767
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND?

00:48.767 --> 00:51.333
- YEAH, IT'S JUST TRAFFIC
THE WHOLE WAY.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.467
I MEAN, USUALLY TAKES
85 MINUTES.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.400
TOOK TWO HOURS TODAY.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.100
NO, I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD,
I'M GOOD.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.200
- HOW ARE YOU, MARIE?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.800
- OH, I TELL YOU,

01:00.800 --> 01:02.700
NOW THAT I'M IN
THE VILLA'S PRODUCTION

01:02.700 --> 01:08.167
OF "THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN",
AS MOLLY,

01:08.167 --> 01:10.000
I'M IN CONSTANT REHEARSAL

01:10.000 --> 01:13.733
AND I'M IN VOICE AND MOVEMENT
CLASSES AND YOGA.

01:15.333 --> 01:18.367
OH, AND BY THE WAY, RAYMOND,
YOU NEED TO STOP BY THE OFFICE

01:18.367 --> 01:20.633
AND CO-SIGN SOME INSURANCE
WAIVER FOR ME.

01:20.633 --> 01:22.067
[horn honks]
OH.

01:22.067 --> 01:25.067
- NO BRAKES!
NO BRAKES!

01:25.067 --> 01:26.100
[honks horn]

01:26.100 --> 01:27.000
- OH!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
[Frank chuckling]

01:28.000 --> 01:31.267
- OH...

01:31.267 --> 01:35.067
HI, FRANK!

01:35.067 --> 01:36.500
- HEY, DAD,
I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.100
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE ME
TO THE DINING HALL?

01:38.100 --> 01:43.267
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO
WASTE MY GUEST PASSES.

01:43.267 --> 01:45.667
- RAYMOND, SIT DOWN.

01:45.667 --> 01:46.800
I'LL FIX US SOME LUNCH,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.667
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE
A NICE CONVERSATION.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.400
- SO HOW ARE YOU, FRANK?

01:50.400 --> 01:52.367
- FAT!

01:52.367 --> 01:54.067
THE DINING HALL
IS OPEN 24 HOURS,

01:54.067 --> 01:55.900
PLUS MARIE
IS COOKING UP A STORM.

01:55.900 --> 01:59.433
SOME DAYS,
I EAT TEN TIMES!

01:59.433 --> 02:00.600
- WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE
THAT CONDO LIVING

02:00.600 --> 02:01.667
STILL AGREES WITH YOU.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.300
- YEP, I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT

02:03.300 --> 02:06.733
AFTER I VISIT
THE THRONE ROOM.

02:06.733 --> 02:10.767
THE SEAT IN THERE
IS CUSHIONED AND HEATED.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.300
RAY, BEFORE YOU GO HOME,

02:12.300 --> 02:15.733
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
A TEST DRIVE.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.833
- TRY AND STOP ME.

02:36.267 --> 02:39.500
- BOY, I HAVE NEVER SEEN
YOUR PARENTS THIS HAPPY.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.433
THEN AGAIN,
I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM HAPPY.

02:41.433 --> 02:42.567
- YEAH.

02:42.567 --> 02:43.867
YEAH.
NO, THEY'RE HAPPY.

02:43.867 --> 02:44.867
SO HOW LONG
WE GOTTA STAY?

02:44.867 --> 02:46.200
- RAY.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.033
- I'M JUST SAYING.
YOU'LL EAT YOUR SANDWICH.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.067
THEN WE'LL GET A JUMP
ON THE TRAFFIC ON THE WAY BACK.

02:50.067 --> 02:51.933
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
ENOUGH WITH THE TRAFFIC.

02:51.933 --> 02:54.433
SO YOU HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE DRIVING.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.700
THAT PROBLEM
IS MORE THAN OUTWEIGHED

02:56.700 --> 03:01.167
BY THE FACT THAT I HAVE
BEEN ALLOWED TO EXIT HELL.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.533
- IT'S JUST LIKE YOU LIKE,
RAYMOND.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.500
EGG SALAD WITH EXTRA EGG.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.233
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MA.
- YUMMY.

03:09.967 --> 03:12.567
- WHOO!
I HAD A FANTASTIC IDEA.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.600
WHAT IF YOU AND I HAVE SOME
ONE-ON-ONE TIME?

03:15.600 --> 03:17.333
NEXT WEEK,
COME BY YOURSELF

03:17.333 --> 03:19.700
AND STAY FOR A FEW DAYS.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.833
- HMM.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.733
NO, I MEAN...

03:24.733 --> 03:28.800
- [laughs]

03:28.800 --> 03:31.067
YOU KNOW WHAT, MARIE?

03:31.067 --> 03:33.367
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.700
I MEAN, I'M GONNA MISS RAY,

03:34.700 --> 03:36.833
BUT I'LL JUST
HAVE TO SUCK IT UP.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.200
- OH, GOOD.

03:42.233 --> 03:44.533
- [singing]
HEAVEN

03:44.533 --> 03:47.900
I'M IN HEAVEN

03:47.900 --> 03:52.667
MY HEART BEATS SO
THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK

03:52.667 --> 03:54.367
[phone rings]

03:55.967 --> 03:58.467
- HELLO?

03:58.467 --> 04:00.767
AH, YOU GOT A PHONE
IN THERE TOO, HUH?

04:00.767 --> 04:02.533
YEAH, OKAY.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.267
- RIGHT IN HERE.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.633
- THANK YOU.

04:07.633 --> 04:09.700
HI. I'M RAY BARONE.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.967
- OH, GREAT.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

04:10.967 --> 04:11.967
- THANKS.
I'M DEBRA.

04:11.967 --> 04:12.967
- HI.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.333
- YEAH, MY MOM SAID

04:14.333 --> 04:16.733
I NEED TO SIGN
SOME INSURANCE FORM FOR HER.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.000
AND ALSO...

04:18.000 --> 04:21.467
ASK ABOUT
A ROLLAWAY BED FOR ME.

04:24.033 --> 04:26.467
- YES, MR. BARONE,
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BY.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.400
WE NEED YOUR PARENTS
TO MOVE OUT.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.733
- WHAT?

04:44.733 --> 04:45.900
- I'M SORRY TO BE SO BLUNT,

04:45.900 --> 04:47.267
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN
A NUMBER OF ISSUES,

04:47.267 --> 04:50.533
AND THEY NEED TO GO.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.233
- WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.633
YOU'RE KICKING THEM OUT?

04:53.633 --> 04:55.233
- YES.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.367
- I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:57.367 --> 05:00.667
FRANK AND MARIE
SEEM INCREDIBLY HAPPY HERE.

05:00.667 --> 05:04.867
- I ASSURE YOU
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES.

05:04.867 --> 05:07.433
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN
TEARING AROUND ON HIS GOLF CART,

05:07.433 --> 05:09.800
ENDANGERING PEDESTRIANS.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.033
- OH?

05:11.033 --> 05:13.367
- WHEN OUR SECURITY GUARDS
WARN YOUR FATHER,

05:13.367 --> 05:17.300
HE TURNS HIS CART
AND AIMS FOR THEM.

05:19.133 --> 05:21.767
ONE TIME, HE SHOUTED, UH...

05:21.767 --> 05:24.967
"HIT THE MONKEY,
WIN A COOKIE!"

05:31.333 --> 05:32.667
IF THIS WERE
THE ONLY ISSUE,

05:32.667 --> 05:34.267
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO WORK THROUGH IT.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.833
BUT YOUR FATHER'S
OVERALL DEMEANOR IS...

05:37.833 --> 05:40.600
SORT OF LIKE A MANIAC.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.500
ONE NIGHT WE CAUGHT HIM
INSIDE THE WALK-IN FRIDGE

05:43.500 --> 05:46.267
EATING AN ENTIRE BALONEY.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.400
- BUT AS BAD
AS YOUR FATHER IS...

05:58.400 --> 06:01.667
- OH, BOY.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.400
- YOUR MOTHER HAS BROUGHT
THE MORALE OF OUR COMMUNITY

06:04.400 --> 06:07.067
TO AN ALL-TIME LOW.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.367
- GO AHEAD, KATIE.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.867
- NONE OF THE OTHER WOMEN
WANT TO BE AROUND HER.

06:10.867 --> 06:15.433
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS THIS WAY OF
APPEARING TO GIVE A COMPLIMENT

06:15.433 --> 06:18.800
WHEN ACTUALLY
SHE'S INSULTING YOU.

06:21.633 --> 06:24.300
AND SHE'S CRITICAL
OF EVERYTHING:

06:24.300 --> 06:29.533
CLOTHING, HAIR, COOKING.

06:29.533 --> 06:30.767
- I JUST...

06:30.767 --> 06:32.833
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THIS IS COMING FROM.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.367
MARIE MUST BE
MAKING SOME FRIENDS.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.400
ISN'T SHE IN THE CAST OF
"THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN"?

06:43.400 --> 06:48.067
- THAT IS NOW
A ONE-WOMAN SHOW.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.467
AND WHEN I TRIED
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT ALL THIS,

06:50.467 --> 06:52.533
SHE SAID THAT MY RUDE TONE

06:52.533 --> 06:55.833
MIGHT BE THE REASON
I DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.700
- SO WE'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.867
- WE HAVE PEOPLE
TO HELP YOU PACK.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.400
- NOW, HOLD ON.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
WE ARE NOT GONNA SIT HERE

07:22.400 --> 07:25.900
AND LISTEN TO YOU
RUN DOWN THESE GOOD PEOPLE.

07:27.933 --> 07:29.467
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE EVEN CONSIDERED

07:29.467 --> 07:34.400
THAT THE PROBLEM
JUST MAY BE EVERYONE ELSE.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.700
- WELL, I--

07:35.700 --> 07:36.800
- OH, FRANK AND MARIE BARONE

07:36.800 --> 07:39.433
ARE FINE
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.000
OH, SURE, THEY MIGHT BE
OPINIONATED,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.267
BUT I FIND THAT REFRESHING.

07:43.267 --> 07:45.033
AND MARIE MAY HAVE
BRUISED SOME FEELINGS,

07:45.033 --> 07:46.733
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

07:46.733 --> 07:51.400
THAT EVERYTHING SHE DOES
COMES FROM LOVE.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.267
- I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

07:53.267 --> 07:55.200
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE US
TAKE THEM BACK.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.800
- I'M...I'M SORRY.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.033
- IS IT MONEY?

07:58.033 --> 07:59.233
'CAUSE WE COULD PAY
MORE MONEY.

07:59.233 --> 08:00.433
- NO, I'M SORRY. WE--

08:00.433 --> 08:03.100
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.200
WE HAVE TO THINK OF
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.600
SEE, OUR PHILOSOPHY HERE IS

08:08.600 --> 08:12.633
"LET'S ALL BE HAPPY
TILL THE END."

08:12.633 --> 08:14.733
- SOME OF OUR RESIDENTS
HAVE THREATENED

08:14.733 --> 08:17.700
TO STOP TAKING
THEIR MEDICATION.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.567
- I UNDERSTAND,

08:20.567 --> 08:22.167
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
THAT WE...

08:22.167 --> 08:25.567
JUST...SOMETHING?

08:29.833 --> 08:31.033
[sighs]

08:31.033 --> 08:33.233
RAY?

08:33.233 --> 08:35.600
- CAN WE LIVE HERE?

08:48.233 --> 08:50.200
- DON'T YOU LOVE
OUR NEW COUCH?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY DO.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.600
I'M STARTING
TO LOVE EVERYTHING NOW.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.533
I WAS GONNA DO MY WORKOUT

08:57.533 --> 09:01.700
ON THE NEW MUSCLEFLEX
AFTER DINNER...

09:01.700 --> 09:02.767
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:02.767 --> 09:04.200
- WHAT?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.133
- DRINKING MAKES YOU
HAPPY WITH YOUR BODY

09:06.133 --> 09:08.400
THE WAY IT IS.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.467
- HI, GUYS.
YOU'RE BACK EARLY.

09:17.467 --> 09:20.067
- WE HAVE TO TALK.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.800
- ABOUT WHAT?

09:29.300 --> 09:31.200
- HI.

09:33.167 --> 09:37.233
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THE HOUSE?

09:37.233 --> 09:40.100
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.867
- MARIE, FRANK. HI.

09:42.867 --> 09:45.167
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU
TO VISIT SO SOON.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.333
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US YOU WERE COMING?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.767
- WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.567
- WHERE ARE MY THINGS?

09:51.567 --> 09:52.867
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
MA, CALM DOWN.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.100
- NO, YOU CALM DOWN.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.700
FIRST YOUR FATHER
GETS US KICKED OUT

09:55.700 --> 09:57.633
OF MY DREAM CONDOMINIUM,

09:57.633 --> 10:00.567
AND NOW THESE TWO
HAVE RUINED THE HOUSE!

10:00.567 --> 10:03.433
- KICKED...OUT?

10:04.567 --> 10:05.767
- ME?

10:05.767 --> 10:08.033
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SUNK US, MOLLY BROWN!

10:08.033 --> 10:11.500
- AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO ATE THE WHOLE BALONEY!

10:19.767 --> 10:23.733
- HI.

10:23.733 --> 10:26.500
IT SEEMS THAT FRANK AND MARIE

10:26.500 --> 10:29.100
WERE ASKED TO LEAVE
THEIR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY

10:29.100 --> 10:31.667
BECAUSE...

10:31.667 --> 10:34.067
WELL, YOU CAN IMAGINE.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.800
- THEY WERE ALSO ASKED

10:37.800 --> 10:41.467
TO NOT LIVE
IN ANY NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES.

10:41.467 --> 10:42.967
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:42.967 --> 10:44.900
I MEAN
I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.467
OH, CRAP!

10:46.467 --> 10:47.733
- ROBERT, THE NEW COUCH!

10:47.733 --> 10:49.333
- OH, I'M SORRY!
I'M SORRY!

10:49.333 --> 10:53.567
- THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
PLASTIC ON A SOFA.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.167
- SO YOU'RE NOT
LIVING THERE ANYMORE?

10:58.167 --> 10:59.633
JUST LIKE THAT?

10:59.633 --> 11:01.300
ISN'T THERE SOME SORT
OF APPEALS PROCESS?

11:01.300 --> 11:02.900
- I'M SORRY.
- IS IT MONEY?

11:02.900 --> 11:03.967
WE CAN PAY MORE MONEY!

11:03.967 --> 11:06.633
- AMY, AMY, AMY.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.567
I TRIED.

11:09.567 --> 11:13.300
THERE IS NO AMOUNT.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.367
- RAYMOND, HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

11:15.367 --> 11:17.400
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DIDN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.067
- YEAH, BUT YOU JUST SAT THERE.

11:19.067 --> 11:20.933
I THINK DEEP DOWN
HE WANTED THEM TO BE KICKED OUT

11:20.933 --> 11:22.767
BECAUSE RAY DOESN'T LIKE
TO DRIVE IN TRAFFIC.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.300
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE
DRIVING IN THIS, HUH?

11:24.300 --> 11:25.767
BETTER GET USED TO THIS

11:25.767 --> 11:27.667
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE DRIVING IN,

11:27.667 --> 11:28.667
YOU SELFISH, SELFISH--

11:28.667 --> 11:29.767
- THE COUCH!

11:29.767 --> 11:32.000
- MY ARM!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.100
- I LIKED THAT CONDO!

11:34.100 --> 11:36.733
I WAS THE LEAD
IN A BROADWAY SHOW!

11:36.733 --> 11:39.367
- ALL RIGHT, STOP IT!
ENOUGH!

11:39.367 --> 11:41.633
EVERYBODY JUST
CALM DOWN!

11:41.633 --> 11:44.267
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.600
PART OF ME ALWAYS THINKS

11:47.600 --> 11:52.233
WHY CAN'T MOM AND DAD
GET ALONG WITH DEBRA AND ME?

11:52.233 --> 11:53.967
AND ROBERT

11:53.967 --> 11:57.300
AND AMY.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.167
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,

11:59.167 --> 12:01.333
"MAYBE IT'S US."

12:01.333 --> 12:03.733
MAYBE IT'S US,
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PARENTS

12:03.733 --> 12:06.233
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO RESPECT THEM AND--

12:06.233 --> 12:07.433
AND HONOR THEM,

12:07.433 --> 12:10.700
LIKE THEY'RE CHINESE
OR SOMETHING.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.700
AND WE DON'T.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.200
WE DON'T ALWAYS.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.133
AND MAYBE IT'S US.

12:22.367 --> 12:27.333
BUT TODAY...

12:27.333 --> 12:29.633
AFTER 40 YEARS,

12:29.633 --> 12:33.400
I THINK I'VE ACTUALLY
FIGURED SOMETHING OUT.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.233
IT'S NOT US.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.667
IT'S YOU.

12:57.300 --> 13:02.300
PEOPLE FROM YOUR OWN
WORLD WAR II WORLD

13:02.300 --> 13:05.900
HAVE SPOKEN.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.233
AND IT'S YOU!

13:17.133 --> 13:19.067
HAD TO BE SAID.

13:23.533 --> 13:27.533
- WELL, I GUESS YOU TOLD ME,
RAYMOND.

13:27.533 --> 13:28.567
SOME HAVE SAID

13:28.567 --> 13:31.833
THAT OURS WAS
THE GREATEST GENERATION.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.667
BUT I GUESS
YOU KNOW BETTER.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.733
- I HAD MY DREAM TOILET.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.733
- AND NOW I'D LIKE TO INQUIRE

13:41.733 --> 13:43.767
TO THE WHEREABOUTS
OF MY POSSESSIONS:

13:43.767 --> 13:47.800
MY SOFA AND MY PIANO.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.567
- THEY'RE IN THE BASEMENT.

13:49.567 --> 13:53.867
- AH...THE BASEMENT.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.767
SO I'M NOT GONE A MONTH

13:57.767 --> 14:04.667
AND MY 100-YEAR-OLD PRICELESS
BULGARIAN UPRIGHT PIANO

14:04.667 --> 14:07.400
IS IN THE BASEMENT

14:07.400 --> 14:12.467
AND HAS BEEN REPLACED
BY YOU WITH THIS.

14:12.467 --> 14:13.933
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS, MA?

14:13.933 --> 14:15.833
- YES, I DO KNOW
WHAT THAT IS!

14:15.833 --> 14:18.467
I MAY BE AN ANCIENT RELIC
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,

14:18.467 --> 14:21.333
BUT I'M STILL ABLE
TO KNOW WHAT THINGS ARE!

14:21.333 --> 14:23.400
THIS IS A SEX MACHINE!

14:23.400 --> 14:25.133
- MA!

14:36.333 --> 14:38.533
- CAN I GO FOR A RIDE?

14:45.833 --> 14:48.200
- IT'S NOT A SEX MACHINE!

14:48.200 --> 14:50.067
IT'S FOR EXERCISE.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.900
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU CALL IT!

14:51.900 --> 14:53.233
LOOK AT THIS PLACE!

14:53.233 --> 14:54.933
YOU TWO HAVE TURNED MY HOME

14:54.933 --> 14:57.733
INTO THE PLAYBOY MANSION!

14:57.733 --> 15:00.467
- MA, WE'VE HARDLY
CHANGED ANYTHING.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.500
- I NEED MY ASPIRIN!

15:04.233 --> 15:07.067
- DOES SOMEONE
WANT TO EXPLAIN TO ME

15:07.067 --> 15:09.500
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW?

15:09.500 --> 15:12.533
- YEAH, YOU MIGHT
HAVE A PROBLEM.

15:12.533 --> 15:14.067
- A PROBLEM?

15:14.067 --> 15:15.467
MM-HMM.

15:15.467 --> 15:17.567
I BOUGHT THIS HOUSE
FAIR AND SQUARE

15:17.567 --> 15:20.133
FOR $26,000, RAYMOND.

15:20.133 --> 15:23.467
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BUT WHERE THEY GONNA GO?

15:23.467 --> 15:25.633
- WHERE THEY GONNA GO?
HOW ABOUT YOUR HOUSE?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.500
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- OH, I DO THINK SO!

15:27.500 --> 15:29.900
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

15:29.900 --> 15:34.133
ROBERT, YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE UPSET.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.633
BUT I WILL
GET A STEPLADDER

15:35.633 --> 15:39.133
AND FIGHT YOU
TO THE DEATH OVER THIS.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.467
- I'LL FIGHT YA BOTH.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.233
- ROBERT!
- I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!

15:49.233 --> 15:50.233
I'LL GO PRISON.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.567
PUT HER ON YOUR SHOULDERS,
RAYMOND!

15:51.567 --> 15:52.700
- I DON'T NEED HER!

15:52.700 --> 15:55.133
- HOW ABOUT I HIT YOU
WITH YOUR OWN WIFE?

15:55.133 --> 15:57.333
[all shouting]

15:57.333 --> 15:59.600
- STOP! STOP!

15:59.600 --> 16:01.267
STOP!

16:02.733 --> 16:06.767
THERE'S ALL THIS STRANGE FOOD
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.700
FIRST LET'S PUT
EVERYTHING BACK WHERE IT WAS,

16:08.700 --> 16:10.667
AND THEN I'LL GO
FOOD SHOPPING.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.500
- NO, MA, WE'RE NOT
PUTTING ANYTHING BACK,

16:12.500 --> 16:13.667
YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:13.667 --> 16:15.300
THE FURNITURE
IS STAYING RIGHT HERE,

16:15.300 --> 16:18.567
AND SO IS MY MUSCLEFLEX,
OKAY?

16:18.567 --> 16:20.500
THIS IS OUR HOUSE NOW!

16:20.500 --> 16:24.067
AND IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GOOD NIGHT.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.600
AAAH! OOHH!

16:27.600 --> 16:30.233
OH!

16:42.633 --> 16:44.033
OH!

16:50.600 --> 16:52.233
- ROBERT.
-
NO.

16:52.233 --> 16:53.933
- MAY I SAY SOMETHING?
- NO!

16:53.933 --> 16:57.700
NO, SEE, I KNOW YOU, OKAY?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.133
AND YOU'RE GONNA
START TALKING,

16:59.133 --> 17:02.600
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL NICE AND SWEET AND LOVING,

17:02.600 --> 17:06.067
AND THEN WE'RE SCREWED.

17:06.067 --> 17:09.700
THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT A SEX MACHINE.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.867
- ROBERT.
-
NO!

17:17.867 --> 17:21.133
YOU DON'T TALK

17:21.133 --> 17:23.533
ANYMORE!

17:23.533 --> 17:24.967
- STOP! STOP!

17:24.967 --> 17:26.867
THIS HAS BEEN
A VERY UPSETTING DAY

17:26.867 --> 17:30.567
FOR ME
AND FOR YOUR FATHER.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.233
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHICH IS WORSE, HONESTLY:

17:35.233 --> 17:37.633
THE HEARTLESSNESS
OF A SOCIETY

17:37.633 --> 17:42.433
THAT HAS SUCH LITTLE REGARD
FOR ITS AGING POPULATION

17:42.433 --> 17:46.167
OR THE REJECTION
OF ONE'S OWN FAMILY.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.300
- ALL RIGHT.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.767
YOU KNOW WHAT, MA?

17:51.767 --> 17:53.233
YOU WIN.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.667
YOU CAN TAKE THE HOUSE.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.233
WE'RE GONNA MOVE BACK
INTO AMY'S APARTMENT.

17:57.233 --> 17:59.667
CALL YOUR LANDLORD.

17:59.667 --> 18:04.533
- UM, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

18:04.533 --> 18:07.800
IT WAS RENT-CONTROLLED,
AND IT'S GONE ALREADY.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.367
- GONE.

18:10.733 --> 18:12.967
- WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO LIVE HERE

18:12.967 --> 18:15.433
UNTIL YOU FIND A PLACE.

18:15.433 --> 18:19.333
- OH-OH, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.933
YOU SEE, THAT IS NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN, OKAY?

18:21.933 --> 18:24.833
SO JUST GET THAT OUT
OF YOUR BIG BLONDE HEAD.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.033
NO WAY!

18:26.033 --> 18:27.900
- WELL, WAIT.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.333
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE COULD SAVE UP
FOR OUR OWN PLACE QUICKER

18:30.333 --> 18:32.733
IF WE STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE.

18:32.733 --> 18:33.767
AND BESIDES,

18:33.767 --> 18:35.533
WE JUST SPENT A FORTUNE
ON FURNITURE,

18:35.533 --> 18:37.567
AND WE CAN'T EVEN RETURN
THE COUCH OR THE MUSCLEFLEX

18:37.567 --> 18:39.700
BECAUSE YOU JUST
RUINED THEM...

18:39.700 --> 18:41.567
SWEETIE.

18:43.867 --> 18:45.500
- MY LIFE.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.933
WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO MY LIFE?

18:57.700 --> 19:01.567
WAS THIS YOUR PLAN, HUH?

19:01.567 --> 19:03.367
YOU SAT UP THERE

19:03.367 --> 19:06.233
AND YOU PUT ME
THROUGH EVERYTHING

19:06.233 --> 19:10.300
AND THEN LET ME
END UP LIKE THIS?

19:10.300 --> 19:14.700
WELL, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING, MISTER.

19:14.700 --> 19:15.900
YOU...

19:15.900 --> 19:18.900
ARE NOT FUNNY.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.833
- HE DOES SCREW WITH HIM A LOT.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.033
- MOM.

19:35.033 --> 19:38.233
I-IF, IN FACT,

19:38.233 --> 19:42.400
YOU ARE SERIOUS
ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL,

19:42.400 --> 19:45.033
THEN...

19:45.033 --> 19:46.833
[exhales]

19:51.867 --> 19:55.333
WE ACCEPT.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.767
- GOOD.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.700
YOU SEE, EVERYTHING
HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

19:59.700 --> 20:03.333
AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
WE'LL BE TOGETHER!

20:03.333 --> 20:05.267
- HA-HA-HA! HA!

20:05.267 --> 20:07.233
SORRY. SORRY.

20:07.233 --> 20:08.433
NO, I'M SORRY.

20:08.433 --> 20:11.033
I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS, YEAH.

20:13.633 --> 20:16.233
- I HATE THIS CHAIR.

20:16.233 --> 20:19.367
BUT THEN AGAIN,
MY ASS HAS BEEN SPOILED.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.067
[door opens]

20:37.767 --> 20:38.767
- HEY.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.000
- HEY.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.900
WHAT'S UP, NEIGHBOR?

20:43.900 --> 20:45.700
- MA WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU AND DEBRA

20:45.700 --> 20:47.767
ARE COMING OVER TO WATCH
THE OPERA ON TELEVISION

20:47.767 --> 20:50.167
WITH THEM AND US
TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.600
- NAH,
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:58.233 --> 21:00.167
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER.

21:03.167 --> 21:06.700
- THIS IS THE SADDEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.367
- HEY.

21:15.367 --> 21:18.933
- HI, AMY.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

21:18.933 --> 21:20.467
- MARIE WANTED
TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW

21:20.467 --> 21:22.600
BEFORE YOU DECIDED
THAT PLACIDO DOMINGO

21:22.600 --> 21:26.467
WAS SINGING
THIS PARTICULAR OPERA.

21:26.467 --> 21:29.600
- OH, YEAH?
THANKS.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.233
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.600
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.100
- GOD IS FUNNY.
