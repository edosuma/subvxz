00:03.086 --> 00:05.589
-[class bell ringing]
-[Gerry] Have a good day.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.012
-Yes?
-You said you wanted to
see me after class, sir.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.932
Yes.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.312
What were you doing?
Why did I want to see you?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.523
-I don't know.
-Tell me what made me...

00:22.523 --> 00:24.650
When you were sitting
and I said,

00:24.650 --> 00:26.401
"Stephan, see me after class!"

00:26.401 --> 00:31.573
There was something going on
in your vicinity caused by you.

00:31.573 --> 00:35.285
What was that? Remember,
seconds before? What was it?

00:35.285 --> 00:36.996
I don't remember.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.747
[scoffs]

00:38.747 --> 00:40.916
[stammering] I don't really
know what's happening.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.377
No, no I bet you don't.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.463
I'm not telling you because I
want you to think about it okay?

00:46.463 --> 00:49.216
-Don't try this again.
-Yes, sir.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.051
'Cause I know.
Go!

00:52.051 --> 00:55.597
Exactly what you did.
Don't think I don't know.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.685
And don't do it again.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.901
[to himself]
What did he do? What...?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.861
Oh! I know what.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.446
♪ I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie ♪

01:11.446 --> 01:14.199

01:21.916 --> 01:26.127
-Aw, my favorite couple.
-Good morning.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.839
Morning. Holding hands,
no affection in the school.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.299
-[Sean] Sorry.
-You guys are here awful
early today.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.552
-You, too.
-Yeah, I got traffic duty, so...

01:33.552 --> 01:36.095
-Oh, okay.
-I came to watch
Sean's practice.

01:36.095 --> 01:39.433
Ahhh. That's so cute.
You guys are perfect.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.143
Star athlete, star student.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.563
Star athlete, obviously,
when I was younger.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.858
-So... You're a lucky man.
-Thanks, sir.

01:47.858 --> 01:51.987
I'm still looking for my "you,"
my "you," Miranda.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.618
Okay, not my you,
not as in you specifically.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.412
But like something like you that
was older. That's what I was...

02:00.412 --> 02:05.250
Okay, let me just backtrack.
What I'm saying, Miranda,

02:05.250 --> 02:08.963
is if I was younger and still
in high school we would date.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.214
No, no we wouldn't.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.883
No, we would. We
would probably date.

02:12.883 --> 02:16.762
Trust me, I'm telling you.
You should have seen. I was...

02:16.762 --> 02:19.723
-Sir, don't you have
traffic duty?
-Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.266
But honestly, if I younger...

02:21.266 --> 02:23.268
All I'm saying is if
I was in high school,

02:23.268 --> 02:26.271
You would probably have seen me.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.482
and Sean wouldn't
have stood out.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.610
-Traffic duty?, sir?
-Yeah, thanks. See ya.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.405
[Gerry] See ya.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.284
-Morning ladies.
-Oh, hi, Mr. D.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.411
-Hi, Kira.
-Do you like my hair?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.080
-Sure.
-I thought you would.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.834
Mom, Mr. D says
he loves my hair.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.586
Okay Kira, let's let
Mr. Duncan get back to work.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.213
-I got a new book bag.
-Oh, wow, nice book bag.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.800
-Okay, Kira, off you go.
-Okay, bye mommy.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.718
-Bye-bye.
-Bye Mr. D.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.971
Bye, Kira.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.640
So you're directing
traffic these days?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.350
Going up in the world.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.020
Oh, well, it's something
we all have to do.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.148
Another little thing teacher's
do without getting paid, so...

03:09.148 --> 03:12.567
Anyway, we talked about
dinner... sometime?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.820
-[horns honking]
-Oh yeah, we did.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.823
Okay! Just dealing with
a parent here. One sec.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.075
Sorry. Tonight is sometime.

03:20.075 --> 03:25.622
Tonight is very soon,
but um, okay. Okay, yeah.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.082
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I can do tonight.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.168
Tonight's good.
I can do tonight, too.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.419
-Great.
-[honking continues]

03:33.130 --> 03:38.677
Sorry. Um, well, I'll call you
and uh, iron out the details.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.096
Get your number from
the parent directory.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.140
-Pretend it's an official call.
-That's great.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.683
You gotta move though,
you can't sit here, okay?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.768
-I'm moving.
-That's my job. See ya later.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.645
-Come on, go. Hurry up ma'am.
-[Jean] I'm going.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.731
Thank you.
I don't even know her, so...

03:52.649 --> 03:54.401
Get, get, get, get.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.112
Ah, Mr. Leung, just the guy
I wanted to see.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.199
-Is this a library question?
-Yeah, but it's really simple.

04:00.199 --> 04:03.577
When I am not in the library,
I am on my time, okay?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.914
There are no simple
library questions.
My job is not simple.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.833
You know what's simple?
You understanding rules.

04:09.833 --> 04:13.837
My rules. Disrespectful.
Good day, madam.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.174
[kids laughing]

04:19.218 --> 04:21.762
[laughter]

04:21.762 --> 04:24.305
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me.

04:24.305 --> 04:30.145
Why do you make everything
horrible always?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.857
Shut your little face.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.026
[Bobbi] Purgatory right?
Because he's always like,

04:36.026 --> 04:38.361
"Let me do this for you."
And that's lovely.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.947
-There you are.
-What?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.698
When are you going to start
bringing your attendance?

04:41.698 --> 04:44.118
-Oh, I forgot again.
-You forget every morning.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.536
I apologize.
I will not forget again.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.705
-You're in a good mood.
-I got a date tonight.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.916
-Oh, holy Hannah.
-Yeah, right.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.043
-I do, what is that?
-Try not to be yourself,

04:53.043 --> 04:55.254
and you'll double your chances
of seeing this girl again, okay?

04:55.254 --> 04:57.047
Why would you say that
when I'm on a date?

04:57.047 --> 04:59.133
-Oh yeah, don't wear that.
-I'm not gonna wear this, Bobbi.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.550
I'm going to wear
something different.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.261
Listen, don't talk too much
or you'll ruin everything.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.972
Trudy, what does that mean?
That doesn't even make sense.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.641
-In fact, don't talk at all.
-And don't forget to chew
with your mouth closed.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.475
That's probably better.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.311
Trudy, I don't need this
advice from you two.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.106
-Don't forget to...
-Don't forget to break
up with Craig today.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.356
'Cause you never forget
to do that, do you?

05:15.356 --> 05:17.192
And don't you forget
to hit on a parent.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.945
A dad, when he walks in with
two kids and a wedding ring.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.156
I've been on dates before
guys, I know how to date.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.366
And what gives you two
the credentials to even
give advice on dating?

05:25.366 --> 05:27.744
That's my question
that I leave you with.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.957
-You know, he does have a point.
-He does have a point.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.085
You've got no business
giving anyone dating advice.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.423
Everybody's here.
Attendance is done.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
Yes?

05:42.383 --> 05:45.012
-You usually don't do attendance
until someone reminds you.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.806
All right, not sure
that's entirely true, Kira,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.933
but thank you for bringing
that to my attention.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.061
It is. I'm the one
who reminds you.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.355
All right, well don't be
sad Kira because...

05:56.355 --> 05:58.566
[sing-song I'm gonna
need somebody to take this

05:58.566 --> 06:02.361
attendance down to the office,
who's that somebody gonna be?

06:02.361 --> 06:03.947
I'll do it, sir.

06:03.947 --> 06:07.492
No, Lucy, obviously I'm
going right to Kira here.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.245
I just did all that stuff,
right? Okay? See what I did?

06:10.245 --> 06:12.539
I went like that, so
Kira's going to take it.

06:12.539 --> 06:18.128
Now, you tell Trudy that
Mr. D says: "Here's his
attendance and he wins."

06:18.128 --> 06:20.964
And say,
"Get off his back." Okay?

06:20.964 --> 06:23.133
And tell your mom I had you
help me. Don't forget that.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.260
-Okay.
-That's really important.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.679
When you go home tonight say,
"Mom, Mr. D was really nice
to me."

06:27.679 --> 06:30.431
And you helped me a lot.
Don't forget that.
-Okay.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.267
Next time Lucy, I might go,

06:32.267 --> 06:35.603
"Who's gonna help me take the
attendance to the office today?"

06:35.603 --> 06:38.439
-Who do you think I
want to take it now?
-Me.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.399
Right, see how that
works? When I come right
to your face like that

06:40.399 --> 06:43.402
with the attendance in my hand,
you're the person.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.530
Good.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.116
Mr. Leung?

06:50.535 --> 06:54.039
[whispers] Wow.
[sighing]

06:54.039 --> 06:58.877
I just wanted to thank you so
much for letting me book the
library so last minute.

06:58.877 --> 07:02.130
-I did it for the students.
-[laughing]

07:02.130 --> 07:04.674
Students.
Shut your faces!

07:04.674 --> 07:06.676
Umm, I'll take care of that.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.347
Okay, everyone, keep your
voices down. We're in a library.

07:10.347 --> 07:15.518
What are you watching?
Oh no, turn that off right now.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.355
-Turn it off right now.
-What is this?

07:18.355 --> 07:21.942
-Turn it off.
-[Leung] This is not funny.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.737
[laughter]

07:29.824 --> 07:32.369
-The library is closed.
-Mr. Leung, it's just...

07:32.369 --> 07:34.121
Get out!

07:34.121 --> 07:36.748
Okay, we're gonna
go back to class.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.294
Quickly... Quicker...
Faster, like run.

07:40.294 --> 07:43.964
Let's go. Hurry up,
let's go, let's go.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.553
-[Gerry] Here we are.
-[Jean] Yeah, it's nice.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.056
-Yeah, it's good.
-So, Kira really likes you.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.392
Oh good, I like Kira.
Kira's good.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.353
-One of my favorites.
-Oh, that's really sweet.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.147
They're good that age,
I like that age.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.648
Oh yeah, and by the way,

08:01.648 --> 08:04.734
I don't usually, you know,
date Kira's teachers.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.405
Okay, good. 'Cause that'd be
awkward if you'd dated half
my staff by now.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.490
-Yeah.
-I will tell the teachers

08:10.490 --> 08:13.201
you are off the market
from the staff.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.205
-Thanks.
-[Gerry] Thank you.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.916
Gosh, she was very pretty.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.878
Yes. You are pretty too.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.714
Thank you very much.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.759
[Gerry] You're welcome.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.719
-Let's eat.
-Yeah, this is good.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.013
I'm glad we did this.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.308
I'm glad we
did this too. So...

08:36.308 --> 08:38.935
-No.
-[Diana] Well, hi Larry.

08:38.935 --> 08:42.397
You're the teacher who never
paid me for my services.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.066
-What?
-Little tip with
this one, honey.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.567
Get your money up front.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.946
-She's not one of you.
-And what is she, Gerry?

08:49.946 --> 08:52.991
-It's a long story.
-I'm an elite escort.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.909
It's a short story, it's short.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.996
Bill, my roommate, her
friend set me up as a joke.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.165
And he sent me this
as a date one night.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.667
I thought it was a real date.
We were trying to play
a joke on somebody.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.837
That's funny, funny.
So you're a hooker?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.964
-I'm an elite escort.
-Elite escort.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.426
But not, no it's a joke
and you're going too far.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.553
You know, this is what
you get for not paying.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.347
-I...
-[Diana] Larry.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.349
-Gerry. I do not
pay for hookers.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.226
I do not pay for hookers.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.853
I do not hire hookers
or pay for hookers.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.232
-I don't pay for hookers.
-You know what?
I think I'm done here.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.859
We're done. I'm going to leave
you two to sort this out.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.445
-It's sorted, Jean, please.
-Bye Gerry.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.198
-So nice to meet you.
-Oh, it's nice meeting
you too, Jean.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.117
-Don't call her her name.
-That's too bad,
she's really pretty.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.619
Don't even refer to her
by her name. You don't know her.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.497
Could you just get
out of my life?

09:40.497 --> 09:43.124
Well, listen, there's
an ATM around the corner.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.585
We could settle this up,
I'll just be waiting over there.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.628
No, I will never pay you. Ever.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.517
Bill, Bill!

10:00.517 --> 10:03.103
-Go away.
-I'm not going away.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.147
I need to speak to you.
Seriously! Get over here.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.862
What? What do you want?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.449
Your friend Diana showed
up at my dinner last night.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.617
Asked me for money
in front of Jean!

10:17.617 --> 10:20.579
-Oh, that's not good.
-No, it's not good.

10:20.579 --> 10:23.623
Jean got up and left.
Now I can't get a hold
of Jean, she's furious.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.375
Yeah, you can't bring
a hooker on a first date.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.377
She's an elite escort
and I wish people would

10:27.377 --> 10:28.795
start referring to it as that.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.297
Because that's what it's called,
there's a difference.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.549
Still, that's a rule.
You can't. It's over.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.385
Yeah it's ruined, you
ruined it. But I gotta
make it better now.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.762
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you. You should be sorry.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.974
He was with a different
girl here last night,
right on that same couch.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.018
Haha... ruined your date.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.229
It's a bit late for that.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.982
Mr. Leung, put down the
computer. We need to talk.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.109
Good. I want to
talk to you as well.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.819
I want you to get
rid of the Internet.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.988
Well, that's not gonna happen.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.073
They are using it
to laugh at me.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.908
You have to learn to let it go.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.536
They're sitting right there,
laughing at me,

11:01.536 --> 11:03.704
while I'm sitting
right there.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.958
I want them to laugh behind
my back like they do to you.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.961
Mr. Leung, these videos
come and go all the time.

11:09.961 --> 11:13.131
There'll be a new one soon,
everyone will just forget.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.008
You have to be the bigger man.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.845
Fine.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.763
What do they say about me?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.391
They call you pigeon face.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.939
And I'm gonna let that go.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.864
Who?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.533
All of them.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.079
[Gerry] All right,
have a good day.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.124
Kira, can you erase
the board for me?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.377
-Thank you Mr. D.
-Can I help her, Mr. D?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.337
Not today, there's
only one brush.

11:54.130 --> 11:58.426
[under his breath]
Get a hot single mom Lucy,
and you can help.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.304
-What are you guys doing?
-We're waiting for Kira.

12:01.304 --> 12:05.141
All right, can you wait
back there a little?
I need to talk to Kira.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.893
Kira, is your mom picking
you up today after school?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.270
-No, she has to work.
-My mom's picking me up.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.939
-Mine too, sir.
-Can you guys just step
back a little bit?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.234
You shouldn't really
be listening.

12:14.234 --> 12:18.488
Does she work most nights? Do
you know when her schedule is?

12:18.488 --> 12:21.949
-She didn't work last night.
-My mom worked last night.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.868
My mom's a stay at home mom.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.330
Oh, good. Why don't you
guys go make out in
the hall or something.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.293
Did she say anything
about last night?

12:32.293 --> 12:36.047
Or did she, uh...any moods?
Was she happy?

12:36.047 --> 12:40.176
-Did you recognize anything?
-Nope.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.802
Did she say anything
about losing her phone?

12:41.802 --> 12:44.847
-Sir, I'm done cleaning
the board, anything else?
-Nope.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.101
She's definitely not picking
you up today?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.562
Sir, that's a lot of questions,
it's kind of annoying.

12:52.272 --> 12:57.318
Kind of annoying?
You're annoying.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.864
-Well, look who it is.
-Hey, Trudy.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.492
Don't you "Hey, Trudy" me.
Where's your attendance?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.578
Ugh, I forgot.
It's in my class.

13:06.578 --> 13:07.828
Well, when is it going
to be in my hands?

13:07.828 --> 13:10.290
All right, Trudy,
I'm not having the best day,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.208
so can we just
lay off on the attendance?

13:12.208 --> 13:15.044
Why... Oh! You screwed
up your date, didn't you?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.630
-Okay, none of your business.
-I knew you were going to.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.507
-You did not know.
-Yes I did. What did
you do Gerry?

13:19.507 --> 13:22.969
-Trudy. That's not funny.
-Talk to her? Tell her your
inner most thought?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.512
Scared the hell out
of her, didn't you?

13:24.512 --> 13:25.804
That's none of your business.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.140
Could we stop talking about it?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.725
And I don't want to talk
about attendance.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.143
-Can we just drop it?
-It's important.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.020
-It's not, it's not.
-It's a record of
which students

13:33.020 --> 13:34.648
made it to school alive today.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.150
No it's not! It's to see
who's here. So what?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.654
I need your attendance
first thing every morning!

13:40.654 --> 13:42.905
-Or what?
-I will hurt you.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.661
-Fine, I'll bring my attendance.
-Good.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.828
You should stop talking
about my dates to people.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.331
That's all.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.337
Will they just give anyone
a teaching degree?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.380
[laughing]

14:01.341 --> 14:03.217
[laughing]

14:04.302 --> 14:07.263
[laughing]

14:07.263 --> 14:10.099
[laughter]

14:10.099 --> 14:14.145
All right, everyone,
Leung announcement.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.024
Everyone, okay.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.778
Fine, I will get up
on the chair.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.988
All right, everyone. Okay.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.533
Um, okay, why won't that stop?

14:26.533 --> 14:33.331
Um, as everyone knows I
have been disgraced like a
whisper that has been yelled.

14:33.331 --> 14:38.127
And I demand whoever put up the
video on the internet systems...

14:38.127 --> 14:41.548
To take it down immediately.
I demand your respect.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.967
Thank you.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.554
-End of Leung announcement.
-[student mouths] What?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.392
-[groans]
-[laughter]

14:54.227 --> 14:56.855
[Jean] Okay, just take a seat.

14:56.855 --> 15:01.025
-Hi.
-Gerry, what are you doing here?

15:01.025 --> 15:04.821
I tried to phone you, couldn't
reach you, I wanted to come
down and explain that situation.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.491
-Yeah, I'm at my work.
-Hey! I'm next.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.244
-One second Mrs. Jacobs.
-One second Mrs. Jacobs.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.330
-But my foot hurts.
-Have a seat, it'll feel better.

15:14.330 --> 15:18.334
You know what Gerry? When I'm
on a date and a hooker turns up.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.462
-You hired a hooker?
-She was an elite escort.

15:21.462 --> 15:26.133
When a hooker turns up and my
date owes her money I just feel
like it's my time to leave.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.553
Okay, can I explain now?
What happened?

15:28.553 --> 15:30.513
-[Jean] Mmmm.
-My friend played a joke on me.

15:30.513 --> 15:34.684
Set me up with her, that escort.
Okay? And I didn't know that.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.771
She thought I was a client,
so she thought she was
getting paid.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.607
I'm never paying her,
I never have, I never will.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.442
It just, it was a coincidence
that she was there.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.237
Okay, I can't do this
right now, I'm at work.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.532
Mrs. Jacobs, you
can go straight in.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.659
You should stay,
and get tested.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.204
Tested for what? I wasn't...
Mrs Jacobs... Don't....

16:01.586 --> 16:03.630
-Sausage party.
-Yeah, it is when you're here.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.132
-That's not funny.
-It's not as funny as
the prostitute joke though.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.468
-Which I feel bad about now.
-You could have
at least paid her.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.969
If you'd paid her, that's fine,

16:09.969 --> 16:12.430
you set me up and played
a joke, but if you'd paid her.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.098
Yeah, but then I'd be
out like 100 bucks.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.601
-It's 500 bucks.
-Are you serious?

16:16.601 --> 16:19.312
-That's what she
wanted, 500 bucks.
-That is probably too much.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.733
She showed up on a date,
with a girl that I really like
and ruined the date.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.568
The girl left,
Jean left the date.

16:25.568 --> 16:28.362
-I'm sorry man, I'm sorry.
-I like this girl.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.073
-All right, well you teach
her kid right?
-Yeah.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.160
Be nice to the kid.
Treat the kid special.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.163
You get to the kid and then
you get to the mom, right?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.290
You're all set.
Can I eat my breakfast now?

16:39.290 --> 16:42.335
You didn't solve anything. Why
do I bother you about women...?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.337
-[Woman] Bye sexy.
-[Bill] All right.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.548
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.511
-She said hi to me.
-I feel pretty
threatened by that.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.434
-I got a question for you.
-Oh, now what, Trudy?

16:58.434 --> 17:01.145
-Why do you hate me?
-I don't hate you.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.731
Don't start.
I brought my attendance.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.733
I sent it down with a student.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.903
Gerry, you marked a student
absent who was here.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.989
-So what?
-So what?!

17:10.989 --> 17:13.407
I phoned her parents to
make sure that she was home,

17:13.407 --> 17:15.201
-which of course
she wasn't Gerry.
-Okay.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.119
Which was a big surprise
to her parents, you know,

17:17.119 --> 17:18.788
'cause they dropped
her off this morning.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.541
So naturally they panicked
and phoned the police.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.003
Ohhh,

17:25.003 --> 17:27.129
because they
assume she's here. I get it.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.967
I'm gonna take my time.
Okay... we're good. I got it.

17:30.967 --> 17:35.013
-Okay. Also...
-What?

17:35.013 --> 17:38.474
Mr. Sweeny is away,
so I'm going to need you to
cover his classes on your spare.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.727
-You can't do that.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.187
-Today?
-All week.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.815
-No!
-Don't you mess with me.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.318
Go.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.740
[Leung on recording]
And I demand that whoever
put up the video

17:53.740 --> 17:57.535
on the Internet systems
to take it down immediately.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.663
I demand your respect.
Thank you.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.081
[laughter]

18:02.081 --> 18:06.044
So, this is how it ends
for old Wayne Leung.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.379
[Lisa quietly]
Okay, that's it.

18:08.379 --> 18:13.551
Attention, everyone.
Look... okay.

18:13.551 --> 18:18.347
We all know a video of Mr. Leung
has been going around.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.852
But how would you feel
if something you did ended
up all over the Internet?

18:22.852 --> 18:25.438
-Nobody likes to be laughed at.
-[Phone beeps]

18:25.438 --> 18:30.944
When I was young, my
nana died and it killed me.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.696
[voice trembling] She used
to pick me up from school

18:33.696 --> 18:37.951
every day and then she couldn't
anymore because she was dead.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.787
It was a daily reminder and...

18:40.787 --> 18:43.748
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.709
-Are you recording me right now?
-Yes, I am.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.753
But I'm just standing
here talking.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.965
I know and now I'm going
to put it on the Internet

18:51.965 --> 18:53.925
for all the world to see.

18:53.925 --> 18:57.553
-[phone beeps]
-Oh, so you got me.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.473
-So we're even then.
-This is rich.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.476
You are such a fool.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.812
Everyone look at
the stupid fool.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.316
Foolish.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.736
I guess that wasn't so bad.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.741
[Gerry] Now don't forget
we have practice tomorrow.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.535
I won't, sir.
I'll be there extra early.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.162
-All right.
-Mom!

19:23.162 --> 19:25.706
-Hey.
-Mom!

19:25.706 --> 19:28.793
-I made the basketball team.
-Really?

19:28.793 --> 19:31.587
Really, and I didn't even
have to try out again.

19:31.587 --> 19:35.633
Ah, that is incredible.
'Cause you cut her
the first time.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.052
Second chances
are good to give.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.513
Mm. Okay, Kira, will you wait
in the car for me darling?

19:40.513 --> 19:44.976
-Sure. Bye, Coach!
-See ya. Ah ha, she's excited.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.436
I know what you're
doing, Gerry.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.022
What do you mean?
I'm not doing anything.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.733
I reevaluated and I thought
about it and she's back.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.652
You really don't
give up, do you?

19:54.652 --> 19:56.863
Nope, I do not.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.659
-So we're good?
-I didn't say that Gerry.

20:01.659 --> 20:06.580
-But you didn't not say that.
-I did not say that either.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.876
-So I can call you.
-Definitely didn't say that.

20:13.171 --> 20:16.757
You want me to call you.
She wants me to call her.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.761
Haha... She wants me to...
Hello.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.898
-[Laughter]
-[Lisa's speech in background]

20:31.898 --> 20:34.441
What are you guys watching?

20:34.441 --> 20:36.527
[Lisa's voice]
I killed, my nana.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.572
I killed, my nana.
I killed, my nana.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.908
-[Laughter]
-I killed, my nana.

20:41.908 --> 20:46.120
-I killed, my nana.
-How could you do this?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.081
Make it stop,
turn it off.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.290
-I killed, my nana.
-Make it stop.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.168
That's not true,
I loved Nana.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.837
-I killed, my nana.
-This is the best part.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.173
-I killed, my nana.
-[laughter]

20:57.173 --> 20:59.299
I killed, my nana.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.178
[laughter]

21:02.178 --> 21:06.099
[laughter continues]

21:08.392 --> 21:13.106
-What is wrong with you?
-[laughing hysterically]

21:13.106 --> 21:15.315
It just exploded.
