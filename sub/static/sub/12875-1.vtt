24:35.086 --> 24:37.077
So it is that.

24:37.988 --> 24:40.980

Non-meat eaters.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.955
There is a town in the south of here.

25:52.893 --> 26:00.890
There is an air base.
We plan to go there and flew away.

26:01.867 --> 26:06.930

26:16.080 --> 26:19.140
Totally isolated.
No man ever lived.

26:20.952 --> 26:27.858

far from any disease.

26:31.028 --> 26:33.997
We are not prepared to fight the meat eaters.

26:34.131 --> 26:36.998
We are not prepared to deal with them.

26:40.003 --> 26:44.940
We kill, we survive from this disease.

26:47.877 --> 26:54.976
I do not blame them.

26:55.885 --> 26:59.878

to be taken to the slaughterhouse.

27:19.007 --> 27:21.975

28:56.932 --> 29:01.995
And do not make mistakes. Of course not.

29:58.056 --> 30:01.082
Not exactly work,

30:02.093 --> 30:04.027
No one another.

30:04.129 --> 30:06.996
Feeling cold and empty.

30:07.966 --> 30:10.935
Cold and empty it on my time.

30:11.002 --> 30:16.906
Now you have us, probably not much
but at least no friends to talk to.

30:18.842 --> 30:23.006
We all feel the loss,
just the same.

30:23.881 --> 30:28.818
Maybe talk about hope can help.
Maybe start with journal writing.

30:28.886 --> 30:31.047
He's right.

30:31.855 --> 30:39.886
I do not like guys who talk a lot.

30:40.963 --> 30:45.957
The only thing they can not,
is your soul.

30:48.137 --> 30:51.867
They want to take my soul.

30:57.045 --> 30:59.912
This is very embarrassing.

31:45.858 --> 31:47.883
This is very bad.

31:50.963 --> 31:58.802
My car is broken, wounded in the shoulder and
men do not use take everything.

31:59.104 --> 32:02.004
I really want to kill him.

32:02.106 --> 32:06.975
As I'm saying,
we may have lost the message.

32:09.013 --> 32:11.982
You need to find for me, boy.

32:13.885 --> 32:16.046
Please fix it!

33:27.120 --> 33:29.883
I can see her point.

33:30.890 --> 33:34.826
He would make a big mistake.

33:58.083 --> 34:07.855
I hope he knows, that's the problem
Meat-eating, he will not fear,

34:07.992 --> 34:11.985
and fear
before I tear her heart.

34:12.096 --> 34:14.826
And cut his neck.

34:42.991 --> 34:45.083
This is it.

34:46.995 --> 34:51.830
Hey, you need help?

35:10.051 --> 35:12.019
Murder in a day.

35:12.886 --> 35:14.877
Other alcoholic beverages.

35:15.889 --> 35:19.086
Many times better than last week.

35:20.894 --> 35:22.862
I like your style, man.

35:34.039 --> 35:35.870
Delicious.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.946
You just need me to take this time?

35:46.852 --> 35:48.876
Ok.

36:06.837 --> 36:11.934
He cut one of their hands,
then he turned and stabbed one in the neck.

36:12.075 --> 36:14.976
and amputations person.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.846
Very impressive.

36:18.882 --> 36:24.877
Its sounds interesting,
what an interesting story.

36:27.923 --> 36:31.017
How many have you killed?
How much?

36:31.827 --> 36:33.055
I will be back.

36:33.863 --> 36:37.890
I do not know, but still not enough.

36:38.934 --> 36:43.029
I'm sure he has a lot to kill today.

36:50.078 --> 36:53.809
So you're going to teach me how
Where be great too?

36:55.984 --> 36:57.042
You have to drink a lot.

38:29.004 --> 38:31.837
Why is he going too fast?

38:39.081 --> 38:40.946
Stupid whore.

38:43.985 --> 38:45.885
Whore ...

39:45.843 --> 39:47.902
This is the first time you, too?

41:07.987 --> 41:10.046
<i> He did not say "good night" at all. </ i></i>

41:11.824 --> 41:12.950
<i> bitch! </ i></i>

41:14.927 --> 41:17.919
<i> But he certainly knew what he was doing. </ i></i>

41:41.919 --> 41:43.819
What?

41:43.954 --> 41:46.047
I know how you feel.

41:46.891 --> 41:52.022
If you want to talk to
one, my good listener.

41:52.830 --> 41:57.789
I understand the not so choice
First, believe it or not ...

41:57.901 --> 41:59.801
But I understand.

42:08.845 --> 42:12.872
- He thinks this "open party" for him?
- Who? Alison?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.873
Yes.

42:15.884 --> 42:18.978
Where there is a way, there are men.

42:19.888 --> 42:24.018
I saw that, let.

42:26.962 --> 42:29.896
So, just do.

42:29.997 --> 42:31.055
- Yes, let's do. - Really?
- Yes.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.866
Ok.

42:35.036 --> 42:38.836
I would like to do this from day one.

42:39.841 --> 42:41.866
Open your shoe. (Laughter)

42:42.944 --> 42:45.071
Come on, all right.

43:22.847 --> 43:24.872
We should go from here.

43:24.949 --> 43:26.700
What's going on?

43:26.818 --> 43:30.046
- He's going to kill me.
- Who?

43:34.959 --> 43:37.860
- Where's Jerry?
- I do not know, let's go.

44:25.907 --> 44:26.874
Continue interesting.

44:32.780 --> 44:34.771
- Where is Ricky?
- I do not know.

44:35.015 --> 44:39.782
Ricky.

44:40.020 --> 44:42.989
Ricky, where are you?

45:04.811 --> 45:07.938
- Ricky.
- What?

45:10.082 --> 45:13.984
Ricky, where are you?

45:18.824 --> 45:22.817
- Alison!
- Ricky.

45:41.012 --> 45:45.072
- May I hold the door.
- Hunter where?

45:45.882 --> 45:47.850
I do not know, just keep appealing.

46:04.033 --> 46:05.933
Ricky.

46:10.039 --> 46:12.872
You think this is funny, huh?

46:13.042 --> 46:15.033
No one laughed at Alison.

46:23.785 --> 46:24.945
No one.

46:29.023 --> 46:30.991
You'll be ok, Ricky?

46:32.860 --> 46:34.795
Hey, you can handle here?

46:35.831 --> 46:39.028
Can you wear pants?

46:45.939 --> 46:47.907
- Where is Jesus?
- I do not know.

46:48.975 --> 46:51.875
Jesus.

46:55.981 --> 46:57.972
Jesus.

47:01.053 --> 47:02.020
Damn.

47:03.923 --> 47:05.914
- Run.
- Damn.

47:42.893 --> 47:44.757
Come on.

47:44.961 --> 47:47.794
Come on.

47:48.965 --> 47:50.956
Hunter.

48:08.884 --> 48:10.818
Come on.

48:11.787 --> 48:14.779
Hey, I'm here to play with you.

48:15.056 --> 48:18.889
I think you better there.

48:55.863 --> 48:59.764
Let's get out of here.

48:59.933 --> 49:03.959
Get out of here, this is mine.

49:24.922 --> 49:25.889
I will show to you.

49:28.025 --> 49:30.015
I also know how to play with it.

49:54.016 --> 49:57.782
We spend all this.

50:01.991 --> 50:04.823
Jesus.

50:07.028 --> 50:10.896
Get out of here.

50:14.969 --> 50:16.937
No.

50:42.930 --> 50:44.022
Everything is ok?

50:44.798 --> 50:46.925
Ok, thanks for asking, Alison.

50:48.902 --> 50:53.862
<i> Feels like broken bones,
exposed and infected with this damn thing. </ i></i>

50:54.013 --> 50:56.863
<i> Feels like hell. </ I></i>

50:57.777 --> 50:59.870
<i> But I'm okay. </ i></i>

50:59.946 --> 51:03.746
You know about the monster?

51:03.849 --> 51:08.809
I do not know any such thing.
It was awful when it hit us.

51:08.955 --> 51:12.015
Who wants that?

51:12.857 --> 51:17.817
I'm just saying, they are not
easy shot.

51:18.964 --> 51:19.931
- Yes.
- Yes.

51:19.965 --> 51:24.834
Damn, that's what I expect.

51:26.938 --> 51:29.964
What The stout?

51:30.774 --> 51:32.901
The stout was gone.

51:32.977 --> 51:36.037
The stout was gone? What's going on?

51:41.819 --> 51:44.049
What do we do now?
Where do we go?

51:44.822 --> 51:46.813
Anyone have any suggestions?

51:49.859 --> 51:54.819
Gasoline for cars?
Maybe something could fly out there.

51:55.932 --> 52:00.892
- I'm not sure whether it is ready or not.
but I ... - It will fly.

52:02.939 --> 52:06.965
- If it can fly, I can fly.
- No one ever thought to look for it?

52:07.909 --> 52:11.902
Wait a minute, fuel for aircraft?
Where will you get it?

52:12.981 --> 52:16.041
We are not talking about back there again, right?

52:16.885 --> 52:21.845
Best what else do we have? We have no
anything since the last months. Things change quickly.

52:24.859 --> 52:26.759
Perhaps the city was empty now.

52:26.861 --> 52:31.821
Empty? Excuse me. I just do not want the road
night full of danger.

52:33.034 --> 52:34.865
I think we will be killed so easily.

52:34.935 --> 52:37.904
Who was nearly killed?
It almost killed you?

52:38.005 --> 52:41.735
- Well
- You are? We even almost killed too!

52:41.841 --> 52:45.868
Lyle was dead, Jesus was dead. Go!

52:45.945 --> 52:50.905
Please fix myself? Excuse me.
Since when did you take over this, Alison?

52:51.885 --> 52:56.845
What do you want? You thought
about other people with your ego?

52:58.957 --> 53:01.858
Girl, you're done?

53:04.830 --> 53:08.823
Jerry, open the truck engine.

53:26.017 --> 53:30.750
There is such a thing that can be heard?

53:32.856 --> 53:37.054
Install this.

53:40.897 --> 53:41.921
You want it?

53:42.032 --> 53:44.899
Yes, that's only pair.

53:47.938 --> 53:50.963
Yes, just like that.

54:00.983 --> 54:04.817
What do you do?

54:04.987 --> 54:09.946
God. I am not a whore like your sister.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.819
- Excuse me, I just ...
- You just what?

54:13.895 --> 54:18.855
No matter which conveniently you can, right?

54:18.933 --> 54:21.868
Hey, are you okay? Everything okay?

54:21.970 --> 54:25.905
Everything is okay, Alison.
Thanks for asking.

54:25.973 --> 54:30.808
Heart feels relieved you care about all of us.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.911
Hey.

54:42.755 --> 54:44.985
Hey, I know you can hear me.

54:45.892 --> 54:48.918
Listen, about yesterday.

54:49.762 --> 54:53.926
I was drunk and did go wrong.

54:54.901 --> 54:55.959
What?

54:57.937 --> 55:01.895
What do you mean what? I talked about yesterday.

55:04.876 --> 55:07.003
Well, I drank too much and if I had to say something ...

55:07.779 --> 55:10.748
Say something?

55:11.983 --> 55:12.950
Ok.

55:13.752 --> 55:14.810
Well, just to say something.

55:15.787 --> 55:17.845
Like I say, I drank too much.

55:17.922 --> 55:20.857
Yes, me too.

55:20.925 --> 55:24.827
If your memory back, do not remember it. Ok?

55:25.830 --> 55:30.790
If people are drinking a lot,
it does not mean anything.

55:35.004 --> 55:39.031
You really do not remember, right?

55:43.813 --> 55:46.782
Brock

56:10.972 --> 56:12.963
What do you think?

56:17.044 --> 56:20.775
Clear, cool and quiet.

56:20.882 --> 56:23.783
Let's go.

56:58.951 --> 57:03.910
I must admit that this place
not as I expected

57:15.833 --> 57:16.993
Are there any?

57:17.902 --> 57:21.997
No, there's nothing dry.

57:25.943 --> 57:29.003
Hey, make a guess who is doing it?

57:29.780 --> 57:32.806
Terrible.

57:47.930 --> 57:52.890
A little advice? Beware,
anything is hiding here.

57:55.837 --> 57:57.998
Waiting for the kill.

57:58.807 --> 58:02.903
I often see this scene.

58:39.045 --> 58:40.979
What is it?

58:41.848 --> 58:45.716
Get out of here, kid.

58:48.887 --> 58:50.787
What's this?

58:51.857 --> 58:53.984
Oh, my God.

59:06.904 --> 59:08.872
What's gone wrong.

59:08.939 --> 59:12.932
I think it is not possible at all.

59:13.744 --> 59:16.008
I'm too old to look at things that way.

59:20.017 --> 59:23.850
I think we better get out of here.

59:23.920 --> 59:27.879
Damn, he's right.
We need to go from here.

59:27.957 --> 59:30.755
I told you, but no one
Debbie listened Fast Lane.

59:30.827 --> 59:31.816
So what else are you waiting for?

59:31.895 --> 59:33.954
Gas petrol.

59:34.764 --> 59:35.731
We need gas.

59:35.799 --> 59:38.927
You guys, where our trucks?

59:43.038 --> 59:47.998
It is now appropriate.

59:54.983 --> 59:57.007
Hey, are you going?

59:57.785 --> 01:00:00.754
Can you tell us what happened?

01:00:00.822 --> 01:00:04.883
You'd spoken nothing
or you just go away?

01:00:17.804 --> 01:00:22.764
Hey, do not pretend not to hear me, ok?
Like it or not, we manage together.

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:25.901
So where do you want to go?

01:00:25.946 --> 01:00:27.811
We need trucks.

01:00:27.948 --> 01:00:30.849
I went looking for the truck.

01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:43.725
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

01:00:43.963 --> 01:00:47.763
I will follow him. Ricky, you stay here.

01:00:47.867 --> 01:00:49.766
- Come on, Alison.
- Staying there, Ricky.

01:00:49.834 --> 01:00:53.861
Not what you can do,
only remain here.

01:01:09.853 --> 01:01:12.788
Uh, what's that smell?

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:17.950
Take this to be alert.

01:01:19.863 --> 01:01:21.728
How about you?

01:01:24.967 --> 01:01:28.903
Do not worry about me.

01:01:40.016 --> 01:01:41.846
What's this?

01:01:43.752 --> 01:01:46.915
Be careful in there.

01:01:48.957 --> 01:01:52.859
The atmosphere is very relaxed.

01:01:53.728 --> 01:01:54.922
No.

01:01:54.996 --> 01:02:04.955
I want to go from here. If we go from here,
The first thing I'm going to strip naked and jump into the sea.

01:02:06.006 --> 01:02:08.770
That's very nice.

01:02:08.909 --> 01:02:11.969
That has happened already.

01:02:12.746 --> 01:02:15.840
Debbie, you never had a boyfriend before?

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.782
Depends what you mean "boyfriend".

01:02:18.885 --> 01:02:23.845
No, I just want to tell me no girlfriend
Maybe we can .. you know

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:25.857
I want to get rid of the water.

01:02:25.925 --> 01:02:27.825
I can ..

01:02:27.894 --> 01:02:31.830
Do not be stupid.

01:02:46.979 --> 01:02:50.813
Not as a place to worship huh?

01:02:54.852 --> 01:02:56.877
What has happened here?

01:02:56.954 --> 01:02:59.980
I'm not sure.

01:03:32.888 --> 01:03:37.018
Ricky, was it ye?

01:03:38.994 --> 01:03:43.795
Do you play there.
I have no mood to play with you.

01:03:47.001 --> 01:03:50.767
I'm going to kick her butt.

01:03:56.811 --> 01:03:58.779
What do they do?

01:03:59.914 --> 01:04:03.872
Look at what he did.

01:04:07.888 --> 01:04:10.914
Maybe that's what they call it.

01:04:17.831 --> 01:04:19.923
Why do you say that?

01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:23.799
He just do that for fun.

01:04:23.936 --> 01:04:28.771
This guy really difficult thing.

01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:32.744
What does he?

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:41.943
Let's get out of here.

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:45.951
Was not this the way to get a girl.

01:04:46.725 --> 01:04:49.785
Hey, I stumbled upon ..

01:06:09.769 --> 01:06:10.895
Come on, we have to get out of here,
let's go.

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:11.937
What's this?

01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:14.701
You see something there?
What things do you see?

01:06:14.774 --> 01:06:15.968
We saw something.
Let's go.

01:06:16.709 --> 01:06:19.735
Where's Debbie?

01:06:28.787 --> 01:06:31.722
Debbie was dead? Not likely.

01:06:34.927 --> 01:06:37.987
Let's go.

01:06:40.898 --> 01:06:43.696
Ricky, do not let up.

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:02.976
Hurry up, Ricky.

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.959
Rick, go.

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:17.662
Ricky, fast.

01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:46.851
We are ok

01:07:51.832 --> 01:07:53.732
Come here

01:08:40.712 --> 01:08:42.906
Take you.

01:08:44.747 --> 01:08:47.716
Mad Men.

01:09:14.777 --> 01:09:17.870
I found the truck.

01:09:24.886 --> 01:09:29.845
Hey, what happened there?

01:09:32.995 --> 01:09:36.760
Let's move.

01:09:43.938 --> 01:09:46.805
Hey, thanks.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:52.707
You saved our lives. Thank you.

01:10:07.927 --> 01:10:11.760
I have a few scars in my class.

01:10:13.966 --> 01:10:16.901
There's a story behind my past.

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:26.742
When the last time you made it?

01:10:27.912 --> 01:10:31.905
Almost a year.

01:10:32.784 --> 01:10:37.721
I did not work long enough.
Just drunk all day.

01:10:37.822 --> 01:10:41.724
You know I've been a waste of time?
Why not?

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:48.820
Hard to think when thinking about family when you return.

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:57.736
I do not know want to start from there.

01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:03.907
I just want to drink.

01:11:04.914 --> 01:11:09.874
Before I knew what had happened,
I shoot all nearby.

01:11:14.924 --> 01:11:17.916
Terrible night.

01:11:18.793 --> 01:11:23.662
That's the first time I could not go home.

01:11:26.768 --> 01:11:31.705
The next morning when I opened the door and
look into the

01:11:32.807 --> 01:11:37.766
All decorations scattered on the floor

01:11:38.946 --> 01:11:43.906
That's when I knew what had
happened to my family.

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:54.749
I want to be there.

01:12:09.842 --> 01:12:13.868
I realize that I know my daughter.

01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:22.753
Lying next to him makes me better.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:29.791
He said, "Happy Birthday, Dad."

01:12:29.927 --> 01:12:33.693
He's dead.

01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:40.659
Nothing remains but the
ice cream and cake smeared with blood.

01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:48.843
That's the first time I see meat eaters.

01:12:52.749 --> 01:12:57.709
and since the last time I touch it.

01:13:03.826 --> 01:13:08.786
Only one thing makes
I go on living.

01:13:09.865 --> 01:13:11.833
What is it?

01:13:16.705 --> 01:13:19.697
Hatred.

01:13:21.742 --> 01:13:24.734
So what you would do if
they were gone?

01:13:24.879 --> 01:13:29.839
Then one day you wake up and realize there is no
what is left for you to kill.

01:13:39.726 --> 01:13:43.958
No reason for me to go on living.

01:13:48.768 --> 01:13:53.728
<i> That's what I know. I will not be able to heart. </ I></i>

01:13:54.774 --> 01:13:58.800
<i> She does not need anymore. It has been taken. Lost. </ I></i>

01:13:59.912 --> 01:14:01.777
Forever.

01:14:21.866 --> 01:14:25.893
What do you think?
Too quiet, right?

01:14:26.738 --> 01:14:28.933
Clear, cool, and quiet.

01:14:29.974 --> 01:14:33.841
I think we should do this immediately.

01:14:56.699 --> 01:15:00.658
Not a lot. But I think we can do it.

01:15:01.737 --> 01:15:06.696
- If it can be turned on.
- Oh it will live.

01:16:03.829 --> 01:16:07.697
You ready? It's time.

01:16:21.912 --> 01:16:26.872
Blood <i> new. They are nearby. </ I></i>

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.754
<i> And I know they are looking at us. </ i></i>

01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:38.887
What happened?

01:16:39.896 --> 01:16:42.956
Give me time ok.

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:47.659
You can not switch it on?

01:16:48.872 --> 01:16:50.930
Come on baby.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.674
Let's fucking garbage.

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.912
It would not be alive right?

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:12.655
Come on!

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.919
Come on!

01:17:17.732 --> 01:17:18.790
You see that.

01:17:18.933 --> 01:17:21.902
Is not it the most beautiful sound you heard?

01:17:21.969 --> 01:17:23.698
This is our day.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.865
Damn it, we need fuel.

01:17:28.909 --> 01:17:32.868
Hey, we need gas gasoline.

01:17:52.765 --> 01:17:54.858
You ever ride a boat like this before?

01:17:54.934 --> 01:17:56.799
No. I always feel scared to go up.

01:17:56.902 --> 01:18:01.702
This is your lucky day.
I will tell you a good feeling.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.800
You have a couple of hours, this place will be history.
You can walk along the beach after this.

01:18:07.812 --> 01:18:11.646
I hope you have brought a swimsuit.

01:18:15.753 --> 01:18:16.879
No!

01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:20.713
- Jerry.
- No!

01:18:22.693 --> 01:18:25.753
Help me.

01:18:25.929 --> 01:18:28.693
Save me, stop him.

01:18:29.766 --> 01:18:33.725
Help me.

01:18:34.872 --> 01:18:36.930
Jerry.

01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:57.825
Enter into.

01:19:23.684 --> 01:19:26.915
It will not last. Not for a long time.

01:19:27.687 --> 01:19:29.780
- We're going to die.
- Shut up.

01:19:29.889 --> 01:19:31.914
- We have not much time.
- Shut up you.

01:19:32.692 --> 01:19:34.853
- We're going to die.
- He say ...

01:19:35.695 --> 01:19:38.664
We will not die.

01:19:38.765 --> 01:19:43.725
<i> Damn that's right. It's just a matter of time before it penetrated the door. </ I></i>

01:19:44.704 --> 01:19:48.799
<i> then we die. </ I></i>

01:19:48.874 --> 01:19:51.707
Where is he?

01:19:52.678 --> 01:19:55.738
There's another way out?

01:20:02.887 --> 01:20:04.752
Yeah.

01:20:04.855 --> 01:20:07.824
How so.

01:20:08.926 --> 01:20:12.885
Whoa. The stocky certainly love this all.

01:20:25.942 --> 01:20:27.933
We do not have much time.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.881
What is the plan? We go out and continue
shooting up out of ammunition?

01:20:42.691 --> 01:20:43.680
Not

01:20:43.859 --> 01:20:46.692
You'll be running toward the truck.

01:20:46.762 --> 01:20:47.888
How about you?

01:20:49.665 --> 01:20:51.633
I'm going to kill this bitch all.

01:20:51.734 --> 01:20:54.703
No, they are too many, too strong.

01:20:55.703 --> 01:20:57.933
Do not worry about me, beb.

01:20:59.807 --> 01:21:02.867
I'm ready to play.

01:21:03.678 --> 01:21:06.841
What do you want to do? Save it.

01:21:15.656 --> 01:21:17.715
You ready?

01:21:23.697 --> 01:21:28.657
Prior to that, if there's anything there,
just want you to know, I'm proud that we meet.

01:21:29.936 --> 01:21:34.736
Banjingan.

01:21:34.874 --> 01:21:37.843
That's what I love.

01:21:38.711 --> 01:21:43.671
I remember the case yesterday.
You're a sweet girl, Alison.

01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:48.819
You too.

01:21:49.654 --> 01:21:52.646
It's not a mistake.

01:21:52.791 --> 01:21:56.887
But you still banjingan child.

01:22:19.917 --> 01:22:22.714
- Come on Ricky, towards the truck.
- Ok.

01:22:31.728 --> 01:22:33.696
Let's go.

01:22:57.752 --> 01:22:58.810
- What thing?
- No!

01:23:51.903 --> 01:23:54.701
No one is currently the case with Alison.

01:24:20.831 --> 01:24:22.731
Nobody.

01:24:36.846 --> 01:24:38.871
- Come on!
- Hunter.

01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:43.884
Come!

01:24:47.655 --> 01:24:49.885
Go, go away.

01:24:50.725 --> 01:24:53.626
Ayulah!

01:24:55.663 --> 01:24:59.894
I do not remember that I had no more ammunition

01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:05.669
Not the sound I expected.

01:25:12.779 --> 01:25:13.803
Hunter.

01:25:14.715 --> 01:25:16.774
Alison.

01:25:31.764 --> 01:25:35.824
<i> This is just the beginning, asshole. </ I></i>

01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:42.762
<i> When you go to hell, I will find you and ... </ i></i>

01:26:15.905 --> 01:26:18.897
I will teach you to use the thing

01:26:24.681 --> 01:26:27.706
Alison, do you think this will be?

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:34.916
Yes, Ricky.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:41.693
It will be.

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:45.632
<i> That was the last time I saw Hunter alive. </ i></i>

01:26:45.666 --> 01:26:48.635
<i> Although our future is uncertain,
he saved us by his death. </ i></i>

01:26:52.873 --> 01:26:56.707
<i> And for that, I will always be grateful. </ i></i>

01:26:56.777 --> 01:27:01.737
<i> I just hope he can meet
with what he wants. </ i></i>

01:27:02.849 --> 01:27:04.749
<i> Order </ i></i>

01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:21.889
<i> I am always in a state of severe,
severe that you will never recover. </ i></i>

01:27:24.703 --> 01:27:29.663
<i> Now I'm alive, I
do not know if it's a curse. </ i></i>

01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:36.870
<i> They will not be able to finish their work.
Not able to destroy me. </ I></i>

01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:42.875
<i> But I know who can.
If you want all this ends ... </ i></i>

01:27:45.657 --> 01:27:48.717
<i> You must do this yourself. </ i></i>

01:27:49.718 --> 01:28:00.718
