WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.248
Kemi! Kemi! Kemi!

00:08.342 --> 00:10.584
<i>As a woman, and a woman of color,</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:13.795
<i>I know these struggles firsthand.</i>

00:13.889 --> 00:15.926
<i>- Whose time is it?</i>
- Our time!

00:16.015 --> 00:18.133
<i>- When is our time?
- Now!</i>

00:18.227 --> 00:20.844
<i>And now let me hear you!
Whose time is it?</i>

00:20.938 --> 00:24.978
It sounds like Dr. Seuss fucked
Maya Angelou in the yuzz-ma-tuzz

00:25.067 --> 00:27.605
and then filled her all up
with snoozily-scuzz.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.936
How is this possibly
even working for her?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.613
Socio-politically,
protest chants have proved

00:32.698 --> 00:34.052
- an effective method...
- Okay, off.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.487
Kemi's crowds are huge.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.909
You know what else is huge, Amy?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.515
- Not even really showing.
- Mmm.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.825
You look beautiful.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.827
And how about the 24-hours-a-day

00:41.917 --> 00:43.783
free media coverage
that she's getting?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.493
- Yep.
- MSNBC has something on you.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.294
Put it on this i-thing.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.942
...<i>campaign
showing signs of trouble.</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:50.652
- Oh, Christ.
<i>- Andrew Meyer, husband</i>

00:50.676 --> 00:52.396
<i>- of President Selina Meyer...</i>
- Ex-husband!

00:52.469 --> 00:53.571
Okay. Everything looks great.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.697
- Ready when you are.
- I know.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.157
Let's go, ma'am.
They're all waiting for ya.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.672
Here we go.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.053
Hello!

01:04.230 --> 01:06.348
- What?
- No, this is great. This is great.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.185
<i>Okay! University of Iowa!</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:12.729
<i>People come up to me,</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:16.442
<i>they say, "Why do you want
to be president?"</i>

01:16.577 --> 01:18.054
<i>And I say,</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:21.412
<i>"It's time to finish
the unfinished business</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:23.490
<i>"of four years ago!"</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.292
<i>Say it with me, "Time to finish</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:29.121
<i>- "the unfinished business!"</i>
- "Of four years ago."

01:29.214 --> 01:30.625
<i>Without the "four years ago."</i>

01:30.716 --> 01:34.209
<i>Okay</i>.
<i>Iowa! What do we want?</i>

01:34.303 --> 01:35.905
"Time to finish
the unfinished business..."

01:35.929 --> 01:39.673
<i>No... Not... "New Selina Now"!</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:42.850
<i>- What do we want?</i>
- When I say "shit," you say "show."

01:42.936 --> 01:44.848
Of four years ago.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.395
I was so far ahead.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.319
How are you losing Iowa?

01:53.405 --> 01:55.522
And did you see the new cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine?

01:55.616 --> 01:56.652
Yes. Are angels real?

01:56.742 --> 01:58.483
"Kemi Fever."
Three exclamation points.

01:58.577 --> 01:59.577
It's a pandemic.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.573
Somebody sneezed on our campaign,

02:01.663 --> 02:03.370
now we're bleeding out our assholes.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.073
- Hi, guys!
- Morning.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.644
Ma'am, we're scrapping
tomorrow's schedule.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.668
What?

02:07.753 --> 02:09.606
You're making an appearance
at the Waterloo County Fair.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.166
Block and tackle retail politics.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.498
- Ugh, retail.
- Eat a few corn dogs...

02:13.592 --> 02:15.754
Last thing I need
is my picture being taken

02:15.844 --> 02:17.335
eating dick-shaped food.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.170
I'd rather eat a food-shaped dick.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.348
Okay, folks. Where is Keith Quinn?

02:22.434 --> 02:23.911
I have the <i>New York Times</i>
interviewing him

02:23.935 --> 02:24.996
about running the campaign.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.860
Maybe somebody should be
interviewing the <i>Times</i>

02:26.897 --> 02:29.184
about why they write
so much about modern dance.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.186
Thirty-six hours in Snoozeville.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.767
- That was my major.
- Okay.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.275
How are we going to
RU486 Kemi's campaign?

02:36.365 --> 02:37.365
No offense, Amy.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.169
Mom,
do you have to act that way?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.484
I mean, Kemi is super impressive.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.194
And I'm not gonna lie, ma'am,

02:43.288 --> 02:45.245
- very much my type.
- You're kidding.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.164
Clearly, I have a thing
for strong women.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.519
- What's happening?
- Strong women.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.377
My God, pick a lane. Jesus.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.316
Ma'am, Kemi just picked up
two senators and a union.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.172
A good union or teachers?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.794
Local 74. Iowa Asbestos Workers.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.002
There you go.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.180
Actually, my uncle was a shop steward
in the 7-4. Asbestos killed him.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.631
- On, no!
- I'm sorry, Richard.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.161
Asbestos was the name
of their pit bull.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.268
It was a rescue
that killed its first owner.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.748
That's why you have to go to breeders.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.889
Okay. Order, order.
First item, debate prep.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.099
- Oh, yes.
- That's how we beat Kemi.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.357
Fine. Stupid handshakes,
opening statement,

03:16.446 --> 03:19.814
uh, thank you to Date Rape University,

03:19.908 --> 03:21.344
- first question.
- Madam President,

03:21.368 --> 03:23.485
how do you explain the accusations

03:23.578 --> 03:26.057
the Meyer Fund and your husband
Andrew Meyer stole millions during...

03:26.081 --> 03:27.761
- No. Andrew Meyer is my ex-husband.
- Yep.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.748
And I have had virtually no contact

03:29.835 --> 03:31.417
- with him at this point.
- Mmm-mmm.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.337
Oh. Okay. Uh, we're gonna take
a quick five, guys.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.335
Fantastic. Her Achilles cock.

03:36.425 --> 03:39.543
Andrew! I see Monnie
got a new paint job.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.922
Monnie and I are still together.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.298
Better than ever, in fact.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.097
No. Felicia is my paralegal.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.719
Oh, God, we're all goin' to jail.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.472
- Wait in the car, okay?
- Can you please

03:48.562 --> 03:51.771
find me a real green juice
somewhere in Iowa?

03:51.857 --> 03:54.270
I'm drinking Odwalla
like some country lesbian

03:54.359 --> 03:55.519
who just got to the big city.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.650
- Ma'am.
- Not yet.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.353
So much for debate prep.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.188
Actually, that was our best one yet.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.114
Hey, Ame. Hey, Dan.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.032
Happy Abortion Eve.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.281
- Oh, my God!
- What? Don't they all know?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.737
Go!

04:07.831 --> 04:09.743
Okay, I don't know if I should be sad

04:09.833 --> 04:11.916
- or turned on.
- Ooh.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.602
Richard, you're running yourself
ragged working on both campaigns.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.622
I'm actually a little embarrassed.
I mean, two jobs is no big deal.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.026
In fact, it's the Speltt family motto.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.130
Splett.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.050
Speltt. It's my mother's side
of the family.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.777
I think you should
definitely quit Selina.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.133
I would if I could.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.701
Actually,
I tried to quit last week,

04:26.725 --> 04:28.307
and the president gave me a raise.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.288
- So quit Jonah.
- He gave me a raise too.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.224
Some people say
I'm not fit to be president,

04:32.314 --> 04:34.397
that I'm dangerously unskilled.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.942
But when I debate my fellow candidates
in the debate this Saturday,

04:38.028 --> 04:40.270
I'm finally gonna
set the record straight.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.527
Because that's when
the gloves come off.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.401
Senator James,

04:46.495 --> 04:48.908
<i>you pledged to bring jobs
back to America.</i>

04:50.957 --> 04:52.323
<i>President Meyer,</i>

04:52.417 --> 04:55.034
<i>you say you're tough on crime, huh?</i>

04:55.128 --> 04:56.981
<i>Then why am I not in prison
for punching the president?</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.712
- Pretty good, right?
<i>- Senator Talbot,</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.461
<i>I think your tax plan</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:02.257
<i>is a wack plan.</i>

05:02.886 --> 05:04.127
<i>Psyche.</i>

05:05.889 --> 05:07.175
<i>Undisputed</i>

05:07.265 --> 05:08.847
<i>President of the United States!</i>

05:08.934 --> 05:11.847
I'm Jonah Ryan, and I wanna
suck this message's hot clam.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.803
- Me, too!
- When do we roll that out?

05:13.897 --> 05:16.765
We don't.
You went completely off script!

05:16.858 --> 05:18.099
I ad-libbed.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.980
Teddy, improv is Jonah's thing.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.686
You should have heard
his wedding vows.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.442
He did a really funny Chinese voice.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.194
I expressed how horny I was.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.865
We focus-tested the ad,

05:26.952 --> 05:28.443
and most people are uncomfortable

05:28.537 --> 05:31.746
watching a white man
kick a black woman in the vagina.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.824
I don't see vagina color.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.204
Ooh, why don't we just kick
President Meyer instead?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.734
The debate committee just emailed me

05:37.796 --> 05:39.412
to say that there
are so many candidates

05:39.506 --> 05:41.543
they've decided to host
two separate debates.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.091
One for candidates polling
with at least 5% of the vote,

05:44.177 --> 05:46.464
and another one
for those polling with less than 5%.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.514
And, good news...
Uh, no, that's bad news.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.340
I'm at less than 5%?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.595
In the plus column,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.097
the undercard debate will be first,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.249
which means we have no problem
getting out of the parking lot.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.273
Oh, no, that's bad news, too.
It's stacked parking.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.524
Andrew, you said there was
nothing illegal about the fund.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.570
I thought we both understood
I was lying.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.569
You do know I'm running
for president, right?

06:07.659 --> 06:09.150
Madam P! Got a moment?

06:09.244 --> 06:10.451
Can you fuck off?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.073
Can do, skipper.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.529
- Okay.
- Lee,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.159
do you happen to know if Marjorie

06:15.250 --> 06:18.243
has the complete ledgers
to all the Meyer Fund accounts?

06:18.336 --> 06:20.794
Yes. I'm sure that she does.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.039
That's too bad.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.922
I think I'm gonna pop by her office
and see if it's locked.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.049
For once will you tell me the truth?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.721
How much money did you steal?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.035
Technically it was you
that stole the money from the fund

06:33.059 --> 06:34.891
because I signed your name
on some documents.

06:34.978 --> 06:35.978
Oh, my God.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.769
Don't worry, Lee.
I'll keep you out of it.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.736
Yeah. "Don't worry, Lee.
You won't get pregnant.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.043
"I'll pull out and cum on your back."

06:41.067 --> 06:42.253
General Stattler's
still waiting.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.735
Again, I thought we both
understood I was lying.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.403
General Stattler. How are you?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.606
Sorry to keep you waiting. Come on in.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.908
Madam President,
I have been trying repeatedly

06:50.994 --> 06:54.158
to get your office to sign off
on a presidential funeral plan.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.580
And since your tenure
was so unusually brief,

06:56.666 --> 06:59.875
I took the liberty of using President
Ford's ceremony as a template.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.704
- Who?
- Uh, that's not gonna work.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.632
He was lucky not to get dumped
out of a pickup truck into a quarry.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.335
- My vision for when I die...
- If you...

07:09.429 --> 07:12.092
- No, I am gonna die.
- Hmm.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.926
More of a sort of
a Princess Diana thing.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.476
But classy.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.053
- But no Prince Charles.
- Oh, yeah.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.434
- He's worse than the mother.
- Mmm.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.981
Oh, that's a good idea.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.309
Let's make a list

07:24.402 --> 07:26.940
of everybody we don't want
invited to my funeral.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.271
- Fun.
- Yeah.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.776
And put Andrew at the top.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.027
Already there.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.470
Begging your pardon, ma'am,

07:32.494 --> 07:33.721
but these plans should have been made

07:33.745 --> 07:34.745
before you left office.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.240
Oh, put Montez on the list.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.118
- Hmm.
- You know, I could get reelected.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.408
Ma'am, why don't we just jump
right to embalming options

07:40.460 --> 07:42.873
to minimize decomp
during the rotunda viewing.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.044
- Hughes.
- Ugh.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.247
Do I really want to get embalmed?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.628
- The neck. Yeah.
- Oh, that's true. Right.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.844
Jonah Ryan.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.761
Outsider's insider. Make sure to vote.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.964
Hey, Teddy. Teddy, check this out.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.327
- Teddy, look.
- What am I doing?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.717
- No, get the big one.
- Oh, yeah.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.937
Teddy, isn't he so funny?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.265
He's hilarious, Mrs. Ryan.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.234
Why don't you eat this, Congressman?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.027
- Okay.
- There you go.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.776
- Thank you.
- All right.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.981
- Congressman Ryan.
- Yeah.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.818
How do you feel about being relegated
to the undercard debate?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.119
- Oh, no comment.
- No. Comment.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.696
I deserve to be in the real debate

08:18.790 --> 08:21.328
as much as Selina Meyer
and that hot new black lady.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.001
It is literally the definition
of retarded.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.773
Congressman has
a very busy schedule, thank you.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.437
Hi. Jonah Ryan,
candidate for president...

08:27.465 --> 08:28.956
What the fuck, Teddy?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.962
You can't say "retarded"
in front of a reporter.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.465
- Why, is he retarded?
- No, but you might be.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.672
No. My pediatrician ran the tests.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.803
Besides, if I was, you'd know.
I'd have retard face or whatever.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.121
- He would look different.
- Jonah.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.558
You have to watch what you say.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.727
Damn it.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.735
Wait. Who are you calling?
No. Don't tell my mom.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.893
It's Teddy, yeah.
I'm calling in the favor.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.320
Teddy, look.
It's shitting in my mouth.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.989
He's pretending the potato
is pooping in his mouth.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.738
BuzzFeed rented this house
for all their reporters.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.140
<i>- Babe, why are you wearing that hat?</i>
- Ever since I got it,

08:59.164 --> 09:01.952
they stopped calling me "Old Guy."
Now I'm "Hat Guy."

09:02.042 --> 09:04.625
- It's "Fat Guy."
<i>- Hey, Mike, have you given</i>

09:04.711 --> 09:06.623
any thought to that thing
that we talked about?

09:06.713 --> 09:09.126
<i>I think it would be
really good for Ellen</i>

09:09.215 --> 09:11.832
<i>if we adopted another baby from China.</i>

09:11.926 --> 09:13.792
Wendy, we're barely makin' ends meet,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.594
and ever since the Felix Wade piece,

09:15.680 --> 09:17.262
BuzzFeed's been climbing up my ass.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.465
Somehow they got the idea
I'm a good writer.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.016
And I'm not!

09:21.102 --> 09:22.580
<i>I gotta go help Ellen
with her Mandarin.</i>

09:22.604 --> 09:24.687
All right. Ellen, <i>ni hao!</i>

09:24.773 --> 09:26.981
<i>That means "hello," Mike.</i>

09:27.067 --> 09:28.774
<i>- Have fun, baby.</i>
- Hey, Fat Guy.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.568
Did I hear you're having trouble
meeting your article quota?

09:31.654 --> 09:32.895
Maybe.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.073
You interested in some study buddies?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.445
Didn't I used to be Hat Guy?

09:37.535 --> 09:38.867
I think it was always Fat Guy.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.202
Oh, wow! What a crowd! Hi!

09:48.296 --> 09:50.379
- I hope you'll vote for me.
- "Caucus."

09:50.465 --> 09:52.582
- They don't know what that word is.
- Good point.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.634
Hi, Mom! Don't tell me.
Are these all of your children?

09:55.720 --> 09:56.947
- Yes, they are.
- That's a busy beaver.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.507
- Yes.
- Yes, indeed.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.762
Hey, kids. Were you all
just petting the animals?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.968
- Yes.
- Great.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.644
- Where's Kemi?
- Senator Talbot

10:05.730 --> 10:07.596
is currently using her campaign app

10:07.690 --> 10:09.335
- to host a digital town hall.
<i>- ...woman of color...</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:10.566
Jesus-hashtag-Christ.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.588
- Do we even have an app?
- Of course we do, ma'am.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.399
The current version
only asks for donations

10:14.489 --> 10:16.300
and, for some reason,
deletes your address book.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.407
Technically, it's more of a virus.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.679
I had it but had to delete it
because it was making my phone hot.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.911
Hello! Yes! Yeah!

10:22.997 --> 10:25.410
Madam President,
I have a question and two follow-ups.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.616
You do?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.437
How do you feel about
Governor Calhoun accusing you

10:28.461 --> 10:30.356
of being unfit for office
because of your complicity

10:30.380 --> 10:31.962
in your husband's alleged crimes?

10:32.048 --> 10:34.131
He's my ex-husband, Mike,

10:34.217 --> 10:35.958
and I think
we're all getting pretty tired

10:36.052 --> 10:39.011
of these cheap personal attacks.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.680
Perhaps that kind of thing
plays well in "Nevahda"...

10:41.766 --> 10:42.766
Nevada.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.844
Nevada, but I challenge
Governor Calhoun

10:45.937 --> 10:47.678
and the other candidates

10:47.856 --> 10:50.519
to, uh, join me

10:50.608 --> 10:53.396
in a "non-negative" pledge.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.728
I think it's time
to start talking about

10:55.822 --> 10:59.065
the issues that affect real Americans.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.553
Thank you.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.159
Mike, you said an actual thing.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.736
How the fuck did that happen?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.287
It's like <i>Flowers for Algernon.</i>

11:05.373 --> 11:07.365
I understand that reference now.
It's a book.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.199
Oh, by the way, have you seen Andrew?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.035
I gotta get ahold of him.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.121
I'm startin' to think
he's rippin' me off.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.297
What we do at
Crawford Bloom Associates,

11:15.383 --> 11:18.126
we work with
high-profile clients like yourself

11:18.219 --> 11:21.587
to make sure that
not only are they understood,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.424
but more importantly,
never misunderstood.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.679
We want you to put
your best foot forward

11:26.769 --> 11:28.806
- and not in your mouth.
- Exactly.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.388
That's a good one. I like that.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.222
- I like these guys.
- Okay, so,

11:32.317 --> 11:33.544
you went to the fair yesterday.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.901
Yeah. Let's talk about

11:35.987 --> 11:39.321
the specific incident
that brought you to us.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.366
- Oh, yeah, the retarded thing.
- Yes. Exactly.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.489
Now, when you said
that word, Congressman,

11:44.579 --> 11:46.974
is there, I don't know,
another word that you could have used,

11:46.998 --> 11:49.331
- had the same meaning?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.914
- And there's no wrong answers.
- Nope.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.789
Um, mentally retarded?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.421
No, that's wrong.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.946
I see where your head is at, though,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.757
and you are technically correct.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.713
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.675
And technically also, though,
you see how you're still using

12:07.769 --> 12:09.510
the same form of the hurtful word?

12:09.604 --> 12:10.936
You're feeling what I'm saying?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.139
Not really. Can I get another bagel?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.145
It might be a great time to introduce

12:15.235 --> 12:17.318
a new strategy
that we have developed here

12:17.403 --> 12:20.237
called "360 degree
perspective-taking."

12:20.323 --> 12:22.030
Oh, God, is that like math?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.903
Actually, it's just a way
of using empathy

12:23.993 --> 12:27.111
to help avoid hurting
other people's feelings.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.663
That's so gay.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.536
- Um, what?
- Excuse me?

12:31.626 --> 12:33.458
Oh, guys, come on.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.126
I didn't mean like gay gay

12:35.213 --> 12:37.000
or like, "This guy
and his husband are gay."

12:37.090 --> 12:40.174
I meant gay like, uh,
mentally retarded.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.092
Okay. You know what? Uh, Stephanie,

12:42.178 --> 12:43.794
I need a minute,
I just need one minute.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.800
- I'm so sorry. Thank you.
- Okay. Yeah.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.348
Is this guy on his fuckin' period?
What is...

12:48.434 --> 12:49.470
Ow!

12:51.896 --> 12:54.809
My dumb slit sister was supposed to be

12:54.899 --> 12:56.765
my abortion ride, but now, of course,

12:56.859 --> 12:58.771
she is nowhere to be found, so I'm...

12:58.861 --> 13:00.898
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.981
Would you mind?

13:03.157 --> 13:05.427
Unless you plan on fucking her again
while she's passed out.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.763
She doesn't call that rape, by the
way, that's just regular sex to her.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.744
- I will get my keys.
- Thank you.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.493
Don't wear white pants!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.394
Big news, ma'am.
Governor Calhoun announced

13:13.418 --> 13:15.104
that he's signed onto
your non-negative pledge.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.128
Oh, what a pussy.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.248
Ma'am, every candidate

13:17.338 --> 13:18.749
has made the non-negative pledge,

13:18.840 --> 13:20.456
including Tom James and Kemi.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.550
Look at you!

13:21.634 --> 13:23.714
You've got chocolate
all over your face like a child,

13:23.761 --> 13:25.252
but you're an adult! Adorable!

13:25.346 --> 13:28.259
Also, the dog mayor of Lurlene
has passed away.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.535
- I'm sorry, Richard.
- Oh, my God.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.141
- What? Who?
- The dog that I...

13:31.227 --> 13:32.513
Oh, no.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.443
We should probably
send someone to the funeral.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.480
Make Amy go.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.852
Where is that Fatty McFatty
hiding today?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.683
She aborted her unborn fetus.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.144
Dock her a day's pay then.
Richard, do you want to go?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.945
It would be my honor to attend.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.116
Winner.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.659
Honey, I think that's enough.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.703
These are clearly made
with child labor.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.121
Hold this.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.643
What are you,
some kind of Green Beret?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.455
I was an agricultural advisor.
Nothing more.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.293
Abortion is murder!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.921
Keep your head down, Ames.
I'll part the redneck sea.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.129
All right, all right, back up.
Make some room.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.589
Psalm 106! Think of
the innocent children!

14:10.683 --> 14:13.517
- Oh! You want me to think...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.890
...about the children,
you hog-fingering fucks?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.562
I did think about this.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.356
I considered it,
and I cried, and yeah,

14:20.443 --> 14:23.186
suck my cock,
I even prayed a little, and here I am.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.113
So you can back the fuck off,
you hypocritical cunts,

14:26.199 --> 14:28.782
before I show up to the piss puddle
that is your house

14:28.868 --> 14:30.655
and protest your husband whacking it

14:30.745 --> 14:32.139
to your daughter's
seventh grade yearbook.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.244
That sign's misspelled.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.913
- Come on, Dan.
- Yes. Yes.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.959
Oh, and I hope you'll all caucus
for Selina Meyer.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.534
New Selina Now.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.120
Oh, darn it.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.955
- Okay. Yeah?
- Ma'am.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.836
Um, Kemi killed her boyfriend.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.714
What? How is this
not all over the news?

14:47.804 --> 14:49.636
Her records were sealed. She was 16.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.385
She accidentally hit him
with her Volkswagen Cabriolet.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.933
She is an actual murderer?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.019
Yes!

14:56.104 --> 14:57.686
Who drives an import!

14:57.772 --> 14:59.684
Oh, my God!

14:59.774 --> 15:01.891
I think I'm gonna cry.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.725
We gotta spread this news

15:03.820 --> 15:07.530
like Kemi's boyfriend's guts
all over the pavement!

15:07.615 --> 15:09.652
Actually, he was decapitated.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.699
- Here. You do this.
- Ma'am. Ma'am.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.786
We can't use this.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.736
Social media is exploding with praise

15:14.831 --> 15:16.572
for your non-negative pledge.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.993
Why did you morons let me do that?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.088
Winner.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.172
Oh!

15:24.298 --> 15:26.631
I did it! I did it!

15:26.717 --> 15:28.879
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.257
Enjoy the rest of your day
at the Waterloo County Fair.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.339
Thank you. I don't want this.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.517
Okay. Is there any way
we can accuse Kemi

15:36.602 --> 15:39.766
of murdering her boyfriend,
but in a positive way?

15:39.856 --> 15:42.815
Madam President!
Guess your age? Guess your weight?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.607
Oh. Um...

15:44.694 --> 15:46.936
Okay. What was that?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.007
- Where's Secret Service?
- Just came out of nowhere.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.569
Okay, Ms. Brookheimer,
I do need to warn you

15:51.659 --> 15:53.095
about some of
the surgical risks involved.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.031
Infection, bleeding,
uterine perforation.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.953
Yep, 10-4. Body's a wonderland.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.655
Can I just sign the consent form?

15:58.749 --> 16:00.832
Per Iowa law, I do
have to offer you the option

16:00.918 --> 16:01.958
of viewing the ultrasound.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.205
Less talk, more abortion.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.707
Patient has declined.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.335
I am as sure as I will be.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.171
Okay. We're gonna give you
some medicine now to help you relax.

16:13.264 --> 16:16.473
Oh, yeah? You got any of those darts
they use on rampaging circus animals?

16:16.559 --> 16:17.559
No need.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.912
Everyone's always telling me to relax

16:18.936 --> 16:20.080
and I'm not good at relaxing.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.845
I don't want to relax

16:21.939 --> 16:24.773
'cause I hate relaxing so...

16:24.859 --> 16:26.771
- Ooh.
- Ah.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.397
There you go, tough guy.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.980
- Very good.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.905
Is that the Berkeley VC-10?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.530
That's like the Shelby Cobra GT
of vag-vacs.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.111
I'm sorry, who is this man?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.616
That's Dan.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.743
I'm the proud father-to-not-be.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.244
- Here ya go, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.581
- Madam President.
- Yes.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.788
And the crowd goes wild.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.968
What is up with
the Clubfoot Cunt-tessa?

16:53.054 --> 16:55.782
I think she's worried that you might
beat her up in the girls' bathroom,

16:55.806 --> 16:57.718
- give her a swirlie.
- Oh, no.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.174
Yeah, you would've.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.759
Okay. You know what?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.344
- Can you just...
- Sure. Yeah.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.805
Madam President,
I do believe that we are

17:04.898 --> 17:07.107
literally and figuratively
out to pasture.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.962
Oh, God, it's really too bad,
'cause I've got something

17:08.986 --> 17:13.526
so juicy on Ms. Post-Racial America.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.902
- How juicy?
- I mean,

17:14.992 --> 17:16.949
fresh-squeezed Billy Carter juicy.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.278
But I can't use it, unless...

17:20.330 --> 17:22.698
"Unless?" he wondered.

17:22.791 --> 17:26.411
Unless you wanted
to break the pledge first.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.464
You want me to go back on your word.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.462
No. Forget it. This never works.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.259
- What am I thinking?
- No, no, no, no.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.883
Selina, listen, you got
no reason to trust me, based on...

17:36.973 --> 17:39.306
Yeah. Trying to screw me
out of the presidency,

17:39.392 --> 17:41.509
then trying to actually screw me,

17:41.602 --> 17:42.968
then screwing me,

17:43.062 --> 17:44.894
then writing a book about screwing me.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.769
- Also discussed it on television.
- Lovely.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.521
- If I go negative on Kemi...
- Yeah.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.897
...once she's gone...

17:51.988 --> 17:53.354
The party's stuck with us.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.905
Like it's supposed to be.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.030
"And that is why
I know I'm wrong

17:59.120 --> 18:01.473
"and I would like to apologize
for the hurtful words that I used."

18:01.497 --> 18:04.285
And not just because
there was a camera.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.519
Although if there is a tape,

18:05.543 --> 18:08.911
we would appreciate it
and any copies of that tape

18:09.005 --> 18:12.339
to pray and reflect on.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.460
Come on, guys.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.005
Are you deaf?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.842
Did you not hear what he was saying?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.018
What is wrong with you?
Are you fuckin' retarded?

18:25.146 --> 18:26.887
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

18:26.981 --> 18:29.974
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.309
- No, no, no. It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.110
I accept your apology.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.941
- I really love that sweater.
- Thank you.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.947
One voter at a time, Teddy.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.097
But, Jonah, there were

18:42.121 --> 18:43.282
- two of them.
- I know.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.052
I have left literally
hundreds of messages,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.727
none of which you've returned,
which is why

18:46.751 --> 18:48.208
I am writing this email, Andrew...

18:48.294 --> 18:49.294
Hey, Mike. You good?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.856
Actually, I'm under
a little bit of pressure.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.149
My wife wants to adopt a new kid

18:52.173 --> 18:53.630
and my old boss's ex-husband

18:53.716 --> 18:54.957
maybe stole our life savings,

18:55.051 --> 18:56.236
so I'm trying to write him a letter,

18:56.260 --> 18:57.467
but I can't focus on anything

18:57.553 --> 18:59.273
- 'cause it's so dirty in here...
- Mmm-hmm.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.467
...and bright,
and, oddly, windy, right?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.368
Oh, hey, do you have any more
of those "concentratey" pills?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.133
Oh, yeah, no,
I think you've had enough.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.514
Thank you! "I've had enough, Andrew!

19:07.605 --> 19:10.643
"Mike McLintock has had enough!"

19:11.567 --> 19:14.059
This is a pretty good
turnout for a dog funeral.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.270
I mean, even the governor's here.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.230
Who are all these people?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.691
Novelty mayors are Iowa's
number one source of tourism.

19:20.785 --> 19:21.946
After tornado-chasing.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.153
And coming into town to buy Sudafed.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.035
- Is that a mayor as well?
- That's just a cat.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.367
Could you imagine?

19:30.461 --> 19:32.373
- This isn't Nebraska.
- Richard.

19:32.463 --> 19:33.940
Can I speak with you
after the service?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.375
Of course, Judge.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.298
Uh, how's the search for
the new successor?

19:37.385 --> 19:40.344
Sadly, the mayor was fixed
and cloning was too expensive.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.261
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.135
Would you like me
to neuter the new mayor?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.593
We're being sued
by the sensitivity trainers.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.727
Joke's on them,
because you can't sue the president.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.139
Jonah, I know this is just
the undercard debate,

19:52.233 --> 19:55.397
- but it's still important.
- Well, hello!

19:55.486 --> 19:57.819
Oh, no. Jonah, you should've
worn a costume.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.897
What the fuck?
I gotta debate Dumbledong?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.653
Listen, okay. He's just
the protest candidate. Ignore him.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.075
What's most important is,

20:04.161 --> 20:05.743
you have to be more PC

20:05.830 --> 20:08.072
than a clit ring
made out of wheatgrass.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.199
Don't worry about it.
I got it handled.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.561
I wrote down all the words not to say.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.666
Okay, that'll work.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.755
Welcome back to tonight's debate

20:17.842 --> 20:20.175
featuring candidates
polling between 5%

20:20.261 --> 20:22.548
and not statistically significant.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.755
I'm Brie Ramachandran-Shulhoff.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.681
Let's turn our attention
to foreign policy,

20:26.767 --> 20:28.508
- Congressman Ryan.
<i>- Bring it on, Brie.</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:29.809
Your question is about Africa.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.727
<i>- Pass.</i>
- With China challenging

20:31.814 --> 20:34.477
American hegemony
across the African continent,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.731
should we adopt a more aggressive
policy of forward deployment

20:37.820 --> 20:40.813
by sending U.S. ground troops
into countries like Niger?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.448
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, you can't say that.</i>

20:45.661 --> 20:47.653
<i>I mean, only he can say that.</i>

20:49.123 --> 20:50.705
Say what, "Niger"?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.407
<i>It doesn't matter
how you pronounce it,</i>

20:52.501 --> 20:54.959
<i>we now know that it is wrong.</i>

20:55.045 --> 20:56.536
<i>Congressman, I think you're confused.</i>

20:56.630 --> 20:58.150
<i>She's referring to
the African nation...</i>

20:58.174 --> 21:01.167
<i>- African American nation.
- ...of Niger.</i>

21:01.260 --> 21:03.718
Jesus, Clark,
you're standing right next to the guy.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.170
<i>What did he say?</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:07.221
<i>No, he said it, not me.</i>

21:07.308 --> 21:08.890
<i>But for the record,</i>

21:08.976 --> 21:10.683
<i>I think that the United States</i>

21:10.770 --> 21:13.103
<i>should send troops
into countries like N-word,</i>

21:13.189 --> 21:14.976
<i>and I think it would be best</i>

21:15.065 --> 21:17.102
<i>if those troops were black.</i>

21:17.193 --> 21:19.480
<i>Can I just say,
making friends overseas</i>

21:19.570 --> 21:21.607
<i>is powerful magic.</i>

21:21.697 --> 21:23.937
<i>You ask him any question,
it's gonna be "powerful magic."</i>

21:23.991 --> 21:25.357
<i>I'm gonna ask him a question.</i>

21:25.451 --> 21:26.451
<i>What's your solution</i>

21:26.535 --> 21:28.993
<i>to fix our failing
public education system?</i>

21:29.079 --> 21:32.447
<i>Longer school years, free breakfast,</i>

21:32.541 --> 21:33.748
<i>and magic!</i>

21:33.834 --> 21:35.312
Oh, come on.

21:35.336 --> 21:38.079
Little Richard will be very happy
for his daddy,

21:38.172 --> 21:39.834
the new mayor of Lurlene.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.193
Catherine, he won't be making memories

21:41.217 --> 21:42.583
for another 22 months.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.279
Hey, I think that went
pretty well, right?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.919
I just got here, so I'm gonna say yes.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.471
I want you to add
the Dalai Lama to this list,

21:48.557 --> 21:50.719
'cause I'm gonna be
the only stiff at my funeral.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.427
Oh, look at this. Congressman Ryan!

21:53.521 --> 21:55.888
And this must be Mrs. Ryan.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.314
Or do you go by
your maiden name, Mrs. Ryan?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.766
Oh, either is fine.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.522
No, ma'am, she's my half-sister.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.854
- Step.
- She's his stepsister.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.361
Madam President, Congressman Ryan,
I'm glad you're both here.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.284
It seems I have been appointed
the new Mayor of Lurlene.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.613
- Oh! Congratulations!
- Oh! Mayor Splizzle in the hizzle!

22:12.706 --> 22:14.072
Wow. All right.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.782
But don't you have to be a dog?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.868
Legally, yes, but it's unenforceable.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.794
But, sadly, I have to tell you

22:19.880 --> 22:21.733
that I can no longer work
for your presidential campaign.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.465
- Oh, of course. I understand.
- Oh, I'll be sorry to lose you.

22:24.552 --> 22:25.838
Me, too.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.532
- Ma'am.
- Hmm?

22:28.556 --> 22:30.047
- Ma'am.
- What?

22:30.140 --> 22:31.301
Excuse me. Yes?

22:31.392 --> 22:33.304
It seems that Mike just published

22:33.394 --> 22:36.683
a piece on BuzzFeed entitled
"An Open Letter to Andrew Meyer."

22:36.772 --> 22:38.684
"Dear Mr. Andrew Meyer, I have

22:38.774 --> 22:40.686
"invested my entire life savings
with you,

22:40.776 --> 22:42.813
"and have yet to see
a single dollar in return."

22:42.903 --> 22:44.610
What? Mike's entire life savings?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.484
So we're talking about, what, $6?

22:46.574 --> 22:49.032
The term "Fonzie scheme"
is referenced.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.030
And the article as a whole
is not cool.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.533
Get that Benedict Ronald McDonald

22:53.622 --> 22:54.738
on the phone right now.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.323
And find me Tom James!

23:04.091 --> 23:05.091
Fat Guy's phone.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.837
<i>Mike,
what the backstabbing fuck?</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:09.635
Dude, your mom's on the phone.
She sounds pissed.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.548
<i>And that's why as a woman,</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:15.349
<i>and a woman of color,</i>

23:15.436 --> 23:18.429
<i>my entire life has been
training for the Oval Office.</i>

23:18.522 --> 23:20.684
<i>If I could just add onto that
by speaking...</i>

23:20.774 --> 23:22.515
<i>- You know, Greg...
- Yeah. Okay.</i>

23:22.610 --> 23:26.274
<i>Um, I have actually sat
in the Oval Office</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:28.355
<i>and made tough decisions,</i>

23:28.449 --> 23:30.736
<i>life-and-death decisions.</i>

23:33.454 --> 23:35.616
<i>And believe me, the many,</i>

23:35.706 --> 23:38.414
<i>many accomplishments
of the Meyer administration</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:40.537
<i>were no accident.</i>

23:40.628 --> 23:42.790
<i>What? What...</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:44.733
<i>Oh, did you say... I'm sorry,
did you say something?</i>

23:44.757 --> 23:45.817
<i>- No, you're good. No, no.
- Okay.</i>

23:45.841 --> 23:47.694
<i>- I'd like to hop in, and just...
- Which is...</i>

23:47.718 --> 23:49.209
<i>- I think I know...
- All right.</i>

23:49.303 --> 23:52.796
<i>...what President Meyer
is driving at so artfully,</i>

23:52.890 --> 23:54.847
<i>is that she would like me to tell you</i>

23:54.934 --> 23:57.893
<i>that Senator Talbot here
accidentally murdered her boyfriend</i>

23:57.978 --> 23:59.581
<i>in a reckless car accident</i>

23:59.605 --> 24:00.766
<i>when she was 16 years old.</i>

24:00.856 --> 24:02.643
<i>But you know what? I'm not gonna stoop</i>

24:02.733 --> 24:04.645
<i>to your level and say that,
Selina. I'm not...</i>

24:04.735 --> 24:07.352
<i>I'm not sure what you mean,
Senator James...</i>

24:07.446 --> 24:10.439
<i>I guess we shouldn't be surprised
at this kind of underhandedness</i>

24:10.532 --> 24:12.212
<i>from a woman whose husband,
Andrew Meyer...</i>

24:12.284 --> 24:14.241
<i>- Ex-husband, in fact.
- Whatever he is.</i>

24:14.328 --> 24:15.805
<i>- You want to get it right.
- The two of you,</i>

24:15.829 --> 24:17.570
<i>according to your
former press secretary,</i>

24:17.665 --> 24:20.533
<i>used the Meyer Fund
to defraud millions of dollars</i>

24:20.626 --> 24:23.369
<i>from our obese children,
from our adult illiterates,</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:25.749
<i>- from emerging democracies...
- Our military families.</i>

24:25.839 --> 24:27.546
So where you headed after this?

24:27.633 --> 24:30.216
I got a neo-Nazi on the dangle
in Sweden.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.339
Only one talking point,
but they do stick to it.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.761
<i>Did you know that President Meyer</i>

24:33.847 --> 24:35.964
<i>had a heart attack
a couple of years ago?</i>

24:36.058 --> 24:37.594
<i>Just covered it up!</i>

24:37.685 --> 24:39.597
<i>You had a heart attack.</i>

24:39.687 --> 24:41.599
<i>This was a minor prostate procedure...</i>

24:41.689 --> 24:43.601
<i>If I may interject. Please.</i>

24:43.691 --> 24:44.971
<i>I think that the American people</i>

24:45.025 --> 24:46.732
<i>deserve more from the next president</i>

24:46.819 --> 24:49.106
<i>than a bunch of
politics-as-usual mud-slinging.</i>

24:50.406 --> 24:52.238
Oh, boy.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.940
That Kemi really has it going on.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.741
<i>And it brings me no joy</i>

24:55.828 --> 24:58.320
<i>to revisit one of the worst events
of my childhood</i>

24:58.414 --> 25:01.748
<i>in which, yes, I was in a car accident</i>

25:01.834 --> 25:03.621
<i>that killed a dear friend.</i>

25:03.711 --> 25:06.078
<i>But I have looked up
to President Meyer</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:07.787
<i>since I was a little girl,</i>

25:07.881 --> 25:10.544
<i>and I have heard her many,
many explanations</i>

25:10.634 --> 25:12.751
<i>for her ex-husband's activities
at the fund.</i>

25:12.845 --> 25:14.461
<i>And I accept them all.</i>

25:14.555 --> 25:16.700
<i>Well, you know, if...</i>

25:16.724 --> 25:18.807
<i>- Oh, you do?
- I do.</i>

25:18.892 --> 25:20.328
<i>And frankly,
I'm tired of hearing about it.</i>

25:20.352 --> 25:21.433
<i>I think we all are.</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:23.227
<i>I know I am. Thank you. I...</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:25.930
<i>And as far as both
of your medical issues go,</i>

25:26.025 --> 25:27.687
<i>it's TMI, people,</i>

25:27.776 --> 25:29.733
<i>it's TMI.</i>

25:29.820 --> 25:31.436
<i>And I would just
like to add to that...</i>

25:31.530 --> 25:33.008
- Hold that thought, Governor Calhoun.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

25:33.032 --> 25:34.318
We're gonna take a quick break

25:34.408 --> 25:35.615
and then we will be right back

25:35.701 --> 25:37.363
with more of the presidential debate

25:37.453 --> 25:40.696
live from Drake University
in Des Moines, Iowa,

25:40.789 --> 25:42.280
in just a moment.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.747
And we're clear.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.834
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

25:49.923 --> 25:51.915
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Back in two minutes.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.217
You gotta help me.
Somebody's gotta tell me what to do.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.635
Hit her with the economy.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.553
There's no way her college loan plan

25:57.639 --> 25:59.096
can pay for itself.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.910
Neither can mine, Ben!
None of these plans can!

26:00.934 --> 26:02.370
Do you have your debate cheat sheet?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.885
- Yes, it's right here.
- All right.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.936
Ma'am, this is your
funeral blackball list.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.935
And all of you are on it!

26:08.025 --> 26:10.859
We need to muddy her up.
Something as bad as Andrew.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.060
- Drugs.
- Lesbianism.

26:12.154 --> 26:13.690
Mom, Mom, stop. Okay?

26:13.781 --> 26:15.272
If you don't win,

26:15.365 --> 26:17.152
we are all gonna
have to rally behind Kemi.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.595
- Catherine, who cut your hair?
- Yeah.

26:18.619 --> 26:19.951
One minute, Madam President.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.778
Please head back to the stage.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.408
Okay, um...

26:23.499 --> 26:26.037
Oluwakemi Talibah Talbot.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.207
Oh.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.897
That sounds like a terrorist
to me, folks.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.037
Talibah, Taliban.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.274
Taliban. That's an old chestnut.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.630
Mom, I am begging you

26:32.716 --> 26:34.799
as the mother of a mixed-race child...

26:34.885 --> 26:36.797
Stop it! Stop!

26:36.887 --> 26:39.925
My God! I have had it

26:40.015 --> 26:42.803
with this whimpering
and whining from you

26:42.893 --> 26:44.225
and your generation!

26:44.311 --> 26:46.098
It's time for you to grow a pair

26:46.188 --> 26:48.054
and man the fuck up!

26:49.817 --> 26:51.228
Not bad.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.858
<i>Whether your ceiling is made of glass</i>

26:55.948 --> 26:58.406
<i>or covered in peeling lead paint,</i>

26:58.492 --> 27:00.575
<i>as a woman, and a woman of color,</i>

27:00.661 --> 27:04.371
<i>I want to challenge our notions
of economic justice.</i>

27:04.456 --> 27:06.789
<i>Senator Talbot, I met a farmer...</i>

27:06.875 --> 27:09.538
<i>Let me tell you something
aboutjustice, Senator.</i>

27:09.628 --> 27:11.836
<i>When I was coming up as a lawyer,</i>

27:11.922 --> 27:15.586
<i>I didn't have to remind everyone
I was a woman every 10 seconds</i>

27:15.676 --> 27:17.588
<i>because they never let me forget it.</i>

27:17.678 --> 27:21.718
<i>I smiled all through
the casual grabbing of my behind</i>

27:21.807 --> 27:23.764
<i>and all the secret meetings
on the golf course</i>

27:23.851 --> 27:25.558
<i>that I wasn't invited to.</i>

27:25.644 --> 27:29.228
<i>So how about giving a little thanks
to the women like me</i>

27:29.314 --> 27:31.271
<i>who built the ladder</i>

27:31.358 --> 27:33.520
<i>that you use to get up
onto your soapbox?</i>

27:33.610 --> 27:36.398
<i>How about for once in your life
you stop whining,</i>

27:36.488 --> 27:39.105
<i>you stop complaining, and just man up?</i>

27:39.199 --> 27:41.282
<i>Because I honestly... I...</i>

27:42.703 --> 27:44.990
<i>That's right, you heard me, man up.</i>

27:45.080 --> 27:47.163
<i>Ya know? Let's just say it like it is.</i>

27:47.249 --> 27:49.036
<i>That's it!</i>

27:49.126 --> 27:50.788
All right. All right. If you'll just

27:50.878 --> 27:52.605
<i>show our affection
for all of our candidates...</i>

27:52.629 --> 27:54.666
Congratulations, Catherine.

27:57.551 --> 28:00.089
From Drake University,
this has been CNN's

28:00.179 --> 28:01.761
first Iowa presidential debate.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.681
I'm Greg Hart. Good night.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.182
Aw, I'm so proud of you.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.683
Thank you.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.105
Madam President,

28:13.192 --> 28:15.900
- may I say... Whoa!
- Thank you, Greg.

28:15.986 --> 28:17.852
President Meyer.

28:17.946 --> 28:18.946
- Hey!
- Wonderful job.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.031
You did it, ma'am.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.356
God bless America

28:21.450 --> 28:24.363
for hating women
almost as much as I do.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.866
- Man up! Man up! Man up...
- Get out of my way.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.155
She won?

28:29.249 --> 28:30.490
"Man up."

28:30.584 --> 28:32.291
- Huh.
- That's really good.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.993
Who came up with that?

28:34.087 --> 28:35.248
Catherine.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.546
How ya doin'?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.123
Feels like

28:38.217 --> 28:41.881
someone shoved
a red-hot pair of barbecue tongs

28:41.970 --> 28:43.461
up my joy trail.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.841
Oh, before I forget.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.473
Frozen maxi-pads
soaked in comfrey extract.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.891
My own personal recipe.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.889
That is so nice.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.311
And also

28:52.397 --> 28:54.263
cold and disgusting.

28:54.358 --> 28:56.520
I'm gonna need that back
when you're done,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.442
'cause Leon will pay big bucks for it.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.144
Oh. Ugh.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.942
Dan, did I make a mistake?

29:03.367 --> 29:05.780
What if I never get...

29:08.956 --> 29:11.869
- Yeah?
<i>- Ames-bo-bames. It's Teddy Sykes.</i>

29:11.959 --> 29:15.794
How would you like the chance
to help lead a divisive,

29:15.879 --> 29:18.997
physically repugnant underdog
to historic victory?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.253
You want me to join Jonah's campaign?

29:21.343 --> 29:23.505
<i>- Such as it is. What do you say?</i>
- What?

29:23.595 --> 29:24.948
Ask for campaign manager.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.463
I would need to be campaign manager.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.196
<i>So you shall be.
I'm not gonna lie,</i>

29:28.267 --> 29:31.055
it's gonna be really hard and no fun.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.010
We have got a bit of a problem.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.312
You are in luck,

29:34.398 --> 29:36.105
because my schedule
just got scraped clean.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.228
<i>- We will talk soon.</i>
- Yes!

29:38.318 --> 29:40.651
Get up!
We have something to celebrate.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.773
Nice.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.274
Yeah. Five minutes.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.901
See? When you do good things,

29:44.992 --> 29:46.654
good things happen to good people.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.859
I'm such a good person.
