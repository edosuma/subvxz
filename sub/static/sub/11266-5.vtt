Previously on...
Peter and I have been trying

00:03.921 --> 00:05.339
to conceive
for the past few years.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.007
We'd like to
buy your eggs.

00:08.048 --> 00:09.802
Money is a bit tight right now.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.512
I've been thinking
about your offer,

00:11.553 --> 00:13.388
and it's $20,000

00:13.430 --> 00:15.349
for my eggs, right?

00:15.390 --> 00:16.892
I'm not gonna tell anybody
that we hooked up.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.727
Just because you can't deal
with who you really are,

00:18.769 --> 00:20.312
don't take it
out on me.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.485
I can't believe I just get to
kiss you as much as I want.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.153
What the hell
are you doing on my boat?!

00:28.195 --> 00:30.364
I'm sorry, but I was wrong when
I thought you and I could work.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.907
This is the college guy
you've been dating?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.074
How do you guys know each other?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.076
We're brothers.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.913
Mom, I think I want
to sleep with Dixon.
Wow.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.122
WALTER:
Cool picture. Your parents?

00:39.164 --> 00:40.415
OSCAR:
Man is my dad,

00:40.457 --> 00:42.083
woman is the bitch
who ruined his life.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.919
The guy from the
bad breakup told me

00:43.961 --> 00:45.004
that he was
HIV positive.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.045
I am, too.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.423
Cannon did not reject me!
He raped me!

00:48.465 --> 00:51.719
He's gonna pay
for what he did to you.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.430
ANNIE:
I'm sorry, orange.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.849
Okay.

00:56.891 --> 01:00.602
So I-I just do that
once a day to myself.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.603
Easy.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.480
Um, and you're sure

01:03.522 --> 01:06.107
they don't offer these hormones
in a Flintstones chewable?

01:06.149 --> 01:08.276
Look, if you feel squeamish
about giving yourself the shot,

01:08.318 --> 01:10.029
you can come here
and I'll do it.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.613
Uh, no, no, it's okay.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.574
I-I can do it.

01:13.615 --> 01:17.411
Annie, I just want you to know
how much I appreciate this.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.956
Peter and I have wanted to start
a family for so many years.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.083
It's all we've
ever wanted.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.294
And what you're
doing for us, well,

01:26.336 --> 01:27.546
it's such a gift.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.048
I'm glad that I can help you.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.676
Anyway, let's, um--

01:32.718 --> 01:34.302
Okay, let's talk
about your fee.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.221
A bank transfer--
is that okay?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.640
Sure, yeah, sounds good.
You'll have it by
the end of the week.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.308
Okay.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.604
So, ready for a
little more practice?

01:43.645 --> 01:45.188
Sure.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.487
Hey, Mom.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.948
Hey.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.950
You're home late.
Oh, I know.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.243
Katherine had me typing up
these bios for the new program.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.161
And little known fact:
every actor in the world

02:00.203 --> 02:02.414
has done an episode of CSI.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.498
(laughs)

02:04.541 --> 02:07.002
Oh, nothing, nothing.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.003
Katherine gave me
some leftovers.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.631
You want me to
heat them up?
No!

02:10.672 --> 02:13.508
Um, I mean, it's a sandwich,

02:13.550 --> 02:17.012
so it's-it's cold, and I'm-I'm
gonna eat it cold in my room.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.263
Okay.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.850
So, uh, how is
the job hunt going?

02:21.892 --> 02:25.604
Well, nothing solid yet, but I
do have an interview tomorrow

02:25.646 --> 02:27.355

assistant position.

Uh, sure.

Yeah, definitely.

little girl is fully cooked.

You should still
take it easy.

the chances?

that I got it?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.445
Well, you had sex with
someone who's infected,

Excellent. You
won't be sorry.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.178
We'll see.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.055
So, here is a list

09:57.097 --> 09:59.516
of tasks that I'd like you
to take care of.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.643
Have them done by tomorrow
at 3:00 and you've got the job.

"Create a spreadsheet

one more thing.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.712
Can you stop smiling so much?

10:29.754 --> 10:32.090
It's giving me a headache.

10:49.857 --> 10:53.194
But we can't.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.364
You know, I got to do what I can
to make things right with Liam,

10:56.406 --> 10:58.325
and dating a girl
he used to date...

10:58.366 --> 11:01.035
Technically, we
didn't actually date.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.121
More like pined

11:03.163 --> 11:04.747
and maybe kissed a couple times.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.544
Still...

11:09.586 --> 11:11.546
I know.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.507
It just sucks.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.549
Yeah.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.050
Really, really sucks.

11:18.553 --> 11:22.474
Well, um, I hope things
work out for you guys,

11:22.516 --> 11:26.311

use a brother right now.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.937

I have to sit

for another month.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.417
RYAN:
Hey.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.669
No talking. Do your homework.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.508
Mr. Matthews.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.218
Hi, Principal Nowack.
What's going on?

11:58.259 --> 12:00.261
Our janitors are swamped,
so I thought

12:00.303 --> 12:02.138
I'd take advantage
of our detainees.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.015
Up for some
manual labor?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.184
In exchange,
we'll cut your detention short.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.394
I'm in.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.229
Me, too.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.647
Hey, Annie, it's Mom.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.649
I know you're on your way
to your internship,

12:12.691 --> 12:15.360
but I can't figure out
which slotty thing

12:15.402 --> 12:17.070
this zip thingy goes into.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.156
And I realize that this
is a cryptic message,

12:20.198 --> 12:22.450
so maybe you could just help me
when you get home.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.160
(sighs)

12:26.745 --> 12:28.081
Oh, Annie.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.667
An old sandwich? Really?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.393
Oh, I got to get
this thing washed.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.478
Lots of scum on it.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.938
You're living
in your car, for real?

12:51.979 --> 12:53.189
It's none of
your business.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.649
It is my business.
You're my brother.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.317
I don't have a brother.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.237
Come on. It's been years
since everything went down.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.988
Well, I'm glad you were able
to get over it.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.283
You know, Annie told me
that you were so sorry

13:03.324 --> 13:05.326
about the stolen credit card.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.954
You didn't tell her
the whole story, did you?

13:07.995 --> 13:09.330
No, I didn't.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.166
Look, this isn't about Annie.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.336
Whatever. I just...
just came to give you this.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.005
A key to the room
at the Jacaranda.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.133
All paid for.
Stay as long as you want.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.468
Order room service, whatever.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.346
You know,
just 'cause your mom is rich

13:25.388 --> 13:26.973
doesn't mean you can buy me off.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.142
I'm not trying to buy you off.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.809
Look, you don't
have to see me,

13:30.851 --> 13:32.937
you don't have to like me,
but you can't live in your car.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.031
ANNIE: Hey. So I...
I got your message

13:44.073 --> 13:46.451
about the zip thingy not fitting
into the slotty thingy,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.703
and we got a lot
of work to do, Mama.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.413
Sit down.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.500
Mom...
Are you using drugs?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.918
No, I haven't...
Then, how do you
explain this?

13:55.960 --> 13:59.046
It's not what you think.
Look, I'm not mad. I'm...

13:59.088 --> 14:01.215
No, I am mad-- I'm really mad--

14:01.257 --> 14:02.383
but that's not the
most important thing.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.260
The most important thing
is getting you help,

14:04.302 --> 14:05.844
and we are going
to get you...

14:05.886 --> 14:07.846
No, Mom, just listen.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.474
Those needles,
they're not for drugs.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.184
Well, they are for drugs,

14:11.225 --> 14:13.019
but not the kind
that you're thinking.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.228
I actually think
you're going to be relieved

14:14.270 --> 14:15.438
when I tell you
what they're for,

14:15.480 --> 14:16.564
since they're not
what you think they're for,

14:16.606 --> 14:17.732
and what you think
they're for is way worse

14:17.774 --> 14:18.857
than what they're
actually for.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.984
Annie, you're not
making any sense.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.235
Are you high right now?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.363
No! No. No. Sorry.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.657
Um... okay, look.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.617
Here's the truth.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.371
Um, Katherine can't get pregnant
on her own,

14:31.412 --> 14:32.913
and she's tried
everything,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.582
and she needs an egg donor.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.084
So I agreed to do it,

14:37.126 --> 14:39.337
and tomorrow, I start giving
myself the hormone injections.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.588
What?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.423
Honestly, Mom, it's...
it's not a big deal.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.717
No. Absolutely not.

14:43.758 --> 14:44.925
(stammers) Mom...

14:44.967 --> 14:46.219
This is not up
for discussion.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.721
This will not
be debated.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.430
I'm 18.
That's right--
you're 18.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.431
Way too young
to understand

14:50.473 --> 14:52.266
the implications
of something like this.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.934
What implications? It's an egg.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.103
I've got like a million
of them inside me,

14:56.145 --> 14:57.689
and she can't have a kid
on her own.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.273
That's not your problem.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.401
Look, I think it's
very admirable

15:01.442 --> 15:03.319
that you want to
help her, but...

15:03.361 --> 15:04.696
That's not why
I'm doing this.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.907
I mean, that-that's great,
and I'm glad for that--

15:07.948 --> 15:09.200
don't get me wrong--
but...

15:09.242 --> 15:10.702
that is not the main reason.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.454
The main reason
is that she's paying me, Mom.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.622
$20,000.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.625
And I know that we need
the cash right now.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.627
Not that badly.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.128
Yeah, we do.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.963
You're bouncing checks.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.299
You're getting final notices
from bill companies...

15:25.341 --> 15:26.801
Which is why I'm
getting a job.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.762
What?
You're not finding anything.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.054
That's not your problem.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.138
It is my problem.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.266
I will find something.
Oh, yeah?

15:33.307 --> 15:34.934
Show me the want ad
for a housewife

15:34.975 --> 15:36.977
with no college degree,
no experience and no skills.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.149
I didn't mean that.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.943
It doesn't matter
what you meant.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.696
You're not selling your eggs.
End of story.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.499

gutters out with these things?

in detention for the next month.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.422
No. We'll do it.
Yeah, you'll
be able to eat

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
out of those gutters by the time
we're done with them.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.968
Not that you look like a lady
who eats out of gutters.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.177
'Cause... 'cause you don't.
You actually...

the opposite

16:11.387 --> 16:12.430
of a gutter eater.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.973
And I'm going
to stop talking now.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.516
Wise choice.
Yeah.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.435
I'll be back in three hours.
I want it finished.

Oh, and under no circumstances
are you to go on the roof.

Got it. No problem.
Yes, ma'am.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.058
Dot, dot, dot.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.184
Is it too much?

19:45.225 --> 19:46.226
No.
No, it's perfect.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.269
Okay.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.200
I shouldn't have added the dots.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.451
You shouldn't have
added the dots.
All right. Okay.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.418
We got him.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.838
(all laughing)

20:16.632 --> 20:17.842
(sighs)

20:23.014 --> 20:25.391
Spreadsheets organized,
expenses categorized,

20:25.432 --> 20:27.518
membership
list updated.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.519
And all by 2:45.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.856
Good for you.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.486
Wha... what are you doing?

20:37.528 --> 20:38.779
Oh, that was just busy work.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.907
I wanted to make sure
a desperate housewife

20:40.948 --> 20:42.491
had that can-do spirit.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.911
You won't be doing any of that
as my personal assistant.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.247
No, you'll be getting me coffee
and scheduling my manicures,

20:48.288 --> 20:50.624
combing my hair
when I get out of the pool.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.751
Congratulations.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.086
You got the job, missy.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.922
(sighs)

20:55.963 --> 20:57.173
No.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.257
(chuckles) Excuse me?

20:58.298 --> 21:00.093
I said no.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.886
Just because I'm not
a college graduate

21:01.928 --> 21:03.763
doesn't mean I deserve
to be abused

21:03.804 --> 21:05.681
by some spoiled
trust fund brat

21:05.723 --> 21:07.600
who's never worked
a single day in her life.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.268
That's right.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.311
That's what I said,
and I meant it.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.355
No, I-I think
my water just broke.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.608
What? Oh.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.776
Yeah.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.694
Uh, I need to get
to the hospital.
Well...

21:18.736 --> 21:20.029
(stammering):
Wait.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.447
Um, you can't
drive yourself.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.782
I'll take you.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.242
(sighs)

21:24.283 --> 21:27.036
Okay. Uh, uh, fine,
but we'll take my car.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.746
You look like
you drive a minivan.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.000
I really don't think
we should be up here.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.628
Look, I know what the
principal said, okay,

21:35.669 --> 21:38.631
but if we do it this way,
we'll be done in ten minutes.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.258
You know what's funny
about these gutters?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.802
They actually look pretty good
from the ground.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.471
You can't tell
they're really full of crap.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.223
Yeah, no kidding.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.267
Like ticking time bombs,
you know?

21:49.308 --> 21:52.478
Stuff just keeps building up
and building up,

21:52.519 --> 21:53.938
hidden from everyone.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.981
Before you know it,

21:55.022 --> 21:56.607
the whole roof
could cave in on you.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.984
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:58.025 --> 21:59.443
What do you think?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.279
All right, can
we just do this?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.447
The sooner we finish, the
sooner I'm done with you.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.490
(chuckles)

22:04.531 --> 22:05.658
Well, not really, man.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.409
I mean, you're still gonna
see me at school.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.912
And every time you do, you're
gonna remember what happened.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.247
Shut up!

22:11.289 --> 22:13.332
Or what?!
You're gonna hit me again?

22:13.373 --> 22:16.502
I mean, you can punch me,
you can call me a fag,

22:16.543 --> 22:18.087
but you're gonna
have to face it.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.839
You can't run away
from who you are.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.177
You don't know
what you're talking about.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.636
I think I do.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.595
Whoa.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.730
Look at that.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.024
Great.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.275
Now we're gonna have
detention forever.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.028
Where are you going?

22:42.069 --> 22:43.863
I got some tools in my trunk.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.489
I'm gonna fix this.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.117
Trust me, I don't want
to spend any more time with you

22:48.159 --> 22:49.535
than you want to spend with me.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.709
(cell phone ringing)

22:59.753 --> 23:00.713
Hello.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.215
MAN:
Mr. Selby?

23:02.256 --> 23:03.966
This is the manager
at The Jacaranda.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.468
I'm afraid we have
a serious problem.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.554
Apparently, a bunch of
high school kids

23:08.595 --> 23:10.430
were in your suite last night.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.391
And from the looks of it,
they had a great time.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.353
How bad is it?

23:15.393 --> 23:18.898
You're looking at
about $5,000 in damages.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.817
I'm going to have to put that
on your credit card.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.364
(Jen screaming in distance)

23:26.404 --> 23:27.405
Um, where is she?

23:27.447 --> 23:28.824
JEN:
Get her out of
me already!

23:28.866 --> 23:30.910
What the hell am I
paying you for?!

23:30.951 --> 23:32.745
I got it.

23:33.871 --> 23:34.997
(screams)

23:35.039 --> 23:36.414
Jen.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.751
Ryan, thank God.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.044
Make them cut her out.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.004
Okay, you're almost there.
Keep pushing.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.173
You keep pushing,
you idiot!

23:44.215 --> 23:45.507
RYAN:
Okay, easy, Jen.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.885
Ryan, I want to kill somebody.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.178
After you give birth, okay?

23:49.220 --> 23:51.264
No, I want to
kill somebody now!

23:51.305 --> 23:54.432
First her and then
you and then...

23:54.474 --> 23:57.353
(screaming and straining)

23:57.395 --> 23:59.063
(baby crying)

23:59.105 --> 24:00.814
Oh, my God.
(gasps)

24:00.856 --> 24:01.941
You did it, Jen, you did it.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.192
Oh, my God.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.193
I did it.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.279
I did it.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.529
How is she?

24:07.571 --> 24:09.073
Actually, she is a he.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.074
You have a son.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.243
Congratulations.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.577
What?

24:13.619 --> 24:14.954
No, it's a girl.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.455
It's a girl;
they told us that it was a girl.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.582
Um, are-are you sure?

24:18.624 --> 24:20.167
I'm a doctor.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.044
We're qualified
to tell these things.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.963
But we had an ultrasound.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.589
Sometimes mistakes are made.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.966
I have a pink nursery.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.968
And-and I have
girls clothes.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.304
And I don't have boys clothes.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.846
I'm not ready for a boy.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.099
Jen, we can get boys clothes.
It'll be all right.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.725
DOCTOR:
Here's your son.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.778
Oh, my God.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.695
Yeah.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.831
I...

24:58.872 --> 25:01.499
Um, I just...
I don't know...

25:01.541 --> 25:03.919
...got caught up in a moment.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.879
Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.256
(gunfire over TV)

25:09.383 --> 25:10.926
(cell phone ringing)

25:15.597 --> 25:16.890
(phone beeps)

25:20.060 --> 25:22.021
(cell phone ringing)

25:26.566 --> 25:29.195
(exhales forcefully)

25:29.236 --> 25:30.863
Hello.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.698
NURSE:
Hello, this is
Dr. Wright's office.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.325
Is this Dixon Wilson?

25:34.367 --> 25:35.368
Yeah, yes.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.869
Um...
(clears throat)

25:36.910 --> 25:38.120
Hi.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.039
Uh, do you have my test results?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.290
They're back, yes.
And Dr. Wright

25:41.332 --> 25:42.540
would like you to come in.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.876
What?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.211
Why?

25:45.252 --> 25:47.421
I'm not sure;
I'm just relaying the message.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.882
M-My test okay, right?

25:49.923 --> 25:51.758
I'm sorry,
I don't have the results.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.052
The doctor has them.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.970
And he'd like
to talk to you in person.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.479
ANNIE:
Hi.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.480
Hey.

26:04.522 --> 26:05.772
Thanks for picking me up.

26:05.814 --> 26:06.690
Of course.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.193
Oh.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.194
He's so small.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.278
Mm.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.197
You want to hold him?

26:13.239 --> 26:15.032
Uh, no, no, it's okay.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.367
I mean, I don't know how.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.701
Oh, it's easy. Here.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.079
Just make sure
you support his head.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.621
There you go.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.507
Wow.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.345
(chuckles softly)

26:36.387 --> 26:38.722
Pretty amazing, huh?

26:38.764 --> 26:40.224
Yeah.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.183
Really amazing.

26:45.438 --> 26:48.023
It's time for me to
check his vitals.

26:48.065 --> 26:48.941
Oh, yeah.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.907
(sighs):
Oh, gosh.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.243
It all seemed easy,
you know, thinking about

26:59.285 --> 27:02.246
giving away my eggs
when it was all abstract,

27:02.288 --> 27:06.417
but, seeing him--
I mean, he's a real person.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.918
Yeah, he is.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.920
I can't do it.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.965
And Katherine is
going to be devastated.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.341
I mean, she's counting on me.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.842
She'll find
another donor.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.595
Someone who's
a little older.

27:17.635 --> 27:18.845
You're only 18, honey.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.846
Yeah.

27:19.888 --> 27:24.017
Mom, I'm so sorry.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.895
For all of the things
that I said to you.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.315
I just-- I know
that it's my fault

27:29.356 --> 27:30.690
we're having
financial problems.

27:30.732 --> 27:31.775
What?

27:31.817 --> 27:33.777
My legal bills were crazy.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.113
Not to mention
that I was so awful last year,

27:36.155 --> 27:37.948
it put a strain
on your marriage.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.366
Honey, is that
what you think?

27:39.408 --> 27:41.285
Annie, listen to me.

27:41.327 --> 27:45.080
Your dad and I-- we-we were
having problems for a long time.

27:45.122 --> 27:46.873
We aren't separated
because of you.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.584
If anything, you and
Dixon are the reason

27:48.626 --> 27:49.960
that we stayed
together so long.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.711
Really?

27:51.753 --> 27:53.380
Yes, really.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.092
What are you doing?
Uh, you can't leave!

27:57.134 --> 27:59.637
He needs a diaper change.

27:59.677 --> 28:00.638
You're fired.

28:00.678 --> 28:02.306
I don't work for you.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.725
Well, what am I
supposed to do now?

28:05.767 --> 28:07.478
Here. You do it.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.728
What do you say?

28:08.770 --> 28:09.771
Uh, now?

28:09.813 --> 28:11.398
"Please." You say "please."

28:11.440 --> 28:12.899
Fine.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.818
You do it
now, please.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.488
About your job offer:

28:17.530 --> 28:20.157
I'll take it,
but I want twice as much money.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.158
What? That's absurd.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.742
Okay. Come on, Annie.

28:22.784 --> 28:23.743
Let's go.
Okay, okay.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.496
Whatever you say.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.665
Just change his diaper;
he's starting to stink.

28:27.705 --> 28:30.083
And anything
over 40 hours is overtime.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.168
This is extortion.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.919
And I'll need health benefits.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.297
Yes, yes.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.132
Whatever you want.

28:37.174 --> 28:41.094
Just-- will you just help me?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.722
I have no idea
what to do with a baby.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.024
Not bad for
a college dropout, huh?

28:54.066 --> 28:56.652
(both chuckle)

28:59.946 --> 29:01.240
You trashed
the hotel room?

29:01.281 --> 29:02.324
Really?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.243
Oh, sorry I didn't invite you.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.785
Oversight.

29:05.827 --> 29:06.828
I'm done with you.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.247
Oh, promises, promises.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.541
No, I am.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.875
I get that
you're mad about

29:11.917 --> 29:13.627
what happened that summer
at the lake house.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.380
But you know what?
I was a kid.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.964
I was scared, too.

29:34.523 --> 29:35.482
Is it working?

29:35.524 --> 29:36.567
Yeah. Time check?

29:36.609 --> 29:38.193
Uh, 4:55. She'll be
back any minute.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.362
Okay, hand me a wrench.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.697
There you go.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.700
Done.
All right.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.744
Oh, the principal's heading
around the building.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.287
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

29:55.168 --> 29:56.462
You done?

29:56.503 --> 29:57.963
(clears throat)

29:58.004 --> 29:59.089
Yep, the gutters
are clean.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.802
Okay.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.554
You boys are free to go.

30:08.848 --> 30:09.808
Whew.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.059
(both laugh)

30:11.101 --> 30:12.436
I didn't think
we'd make it.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.355
Me neither, me neither.

30:15.397 --> 30:16.898
(clears throat)

30:16.940 --> 30:19.276
You did a good job.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.277
Fixing it.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.612
Thanks.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.072
Well, thank you for not
letting me fall off the roof.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.865
Although it would have
been an appropriately

30:25.907 --> 30:27.785
dramatic way to go.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.120
(both chuckle)

30:30.162 --> 30:33.373
Look, Ian, I shouldn't
have hit you

30:33.415 --> 30:35.417
at the bachelor auction,
and I shouldn't have

30:35.459 --> 30:38.629
called you... well,
what I called you.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.630
I'm sorry.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.131
It's okay.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.133
I get what
you're going through.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.218
You know,
I-I went through it, too.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.054
And if you ever
need to talk...

30:49.222 --> 30:50.849
There's nothing to talk about.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.650
RYAN:
Okay, I went to,

30:59.692 --> 31:00.942
like, five places,
and I couldn't find

31:00.984 --> 31:01.943
a Peter Pan collar any...

31:01.985 --> 31:03.153
Shh.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.196
(whispers):
Jacques's almost asleep.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.656
Don't mess it up.

31:05.698 --> 31:06.657
Jacques?

31:06.699 --> 31:08.617
I'm not calling
my son Jacques.

31:08.659 --> 31:09.702
It's pretentious.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.662
Well... (chuckles)
it's his name.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.330
It's a terrible name.
I can already hear the kids

31:13.372 --> 31:14.748
at recess calling him
Jacques Strap.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.291
Then they'll be slapped.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.210
Well, I'm calling him Jack.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.919
You will do no such thing, Ryan.
Why not?

31:19.961 --> 31:21.588
This is for the new daddy,

31:21.630 --> 31:23.382
so he can stay
in the room tonight.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.383
Oh, you know, I wasn't...

31:24.424 --> 31:25.384
Oh, no, I didn't...
...staying.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.677
I didn't, um...

31:26.719 --> 31:27.927
Um...

31:27.969 --> 31:30.806
I'm happy to stay and help, uh,

31:30.848 --> 31:32.474
if you want me to.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.310
I don't want you to stay.

31:35.352 --> 31:36.562
Okay.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.771
But I guess

31:37.813 --> 31:40.190
that you might
be helpful.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.360
At 3:00 a.m.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.404
Okay.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.405
Well, then I'll stay.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.447
For Jacques.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.616
For Jack.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.371
Ivy.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.623
Um, look, right now
is really not a good time.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.250
I know you weren't sick.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.251
What?

31:59.292 --> 32:00.252
Don't even try

32:00.293 --> 32:01.587
to deny that, okay?

32:01.628 --> 32:03.463
'Cause Oscar said he saw you
and Sasha together

32:03.505 --> 32:04.882
after the
bachelor auction.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.091
It's really not what you think.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.634
What were you doing with her?
Ivy...

32:07.676 --> 32:08.886
And why have you
been avoiding me?

32:08.927 --> 32:09.887
I haven't.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.304
Yeah, you have, Dixon.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.390
You've been avoiding me,
and I just need to know why...

32:13.432 --> 32:14.433
What is going
on with you?

32:14.474 --> 32:16.184
Nothing.
Okay, it's
not nothing.

32:16.226 --> 32:17.561
Will you just
tell me the truth?

32:17.603 --> 32:18.812
What is going on?

32:18.854 --> 32:20.731
What's going on is...

32:22.858 --> 32:26.361
(sighs)

32:26.403 --> 32:29.030
I still have feelings for Sasha.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.074
You what?

32:33.243 --> 32:35.370
Yeah.

32:35.412 --> 32:36.663
Yeah, I-I still like Sasha.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.375
So, you and me...

32:42.377 --> 32:45.004
...we can't be together anymore.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.230
Can you see me?

33:02.272 --> 33:03.774
Yeah, perfectly.

33:03.816 --> 33:04.775
SILVER:
And it's recording?

33:04.817 --> 33:06.735
NAOMI:
Uh-huh.

33:06.777 --> 33:08.987
This is
totally gonna work.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.989
Just showing up
to meet a student

33:11.030 --> 33:11.990
at a hotel room

33:12.031 --> 33:13.617
should be enough
to get Cannon fired.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.411
Are you sure you're still okay
with this? I mean,

33:16.453 --> 33:17.621
being alone with him
and all?

33:17.663 --> 33:18.789
Totally. You guys
will be watching.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.249
I'll let him get
a little inappropriate,

33:21.291 --> 33:24.002
then I'll tell him
I'm not feeling well.

33:24.043 --> 33:27.589
And if things get out of hand,
you'll just come in, right?

33:27.631 --> 33:29.466
We'll be there.
Absolutely.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.092
All right, it's almost time.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.218
You should go.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.976
Thanks for doing this for me.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.019
Of course.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.318
We'll be right in there, okay?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.153
Okay.
Okay?
(giggles)

33:50.195 --> 33:51.070
Okay.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.495
(sighs)

34:07.796 --> 34:09.505
(knocking)

34:11.842 --> 34:13.927
Door's open.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.513
(door opening)
CANNON: Silver? Hello?

34:16.554 --> 34:18.724
Make yourself comfortable.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.641
(door closes)
I'll be right out.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.272
So glad you came.

34:26.313 --> 34:27.690
Really been looking
forward to this.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.283
I grew concerned when you
suggested we meet here,

34:37.324 --> 34:38.326
so I called Principal Nowack
and...

34:38.368 --> 34:39.745
This is bad.

34:39.786 --> 34:40.913
This is very bad.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.455
MR. CANNON:
Have you met Ms. Henry?

34:42.496 --> 34:44.583
She's our school therapist.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.458
This is not what it looks like.

34:46.501 --> 34:47.460
You invited Mr. Cannon

34:47.502 --> 34:49.128
to meet you in a hotel,

34:49.170 --> 34:51.297
which is obviously
inappropriate.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.299
Given your medical history...
I had no idea

34:53.341 --> 34:55.427
that you were bipolar.
I'm so sorry, Silver.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.469
Had I known,

34:56.511 --> 34:58.972
I might have recognized
the signs.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.432
No, wait.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.308
That's not what this...

35:02.350 --> 35:03.977
Silver, we think you might
be having another break...

35:04.019 --> 35:05.854
I'm not.
Have you been taking
your medication?

35:05.896 --> 35:08.648
Of course! That has nothing
to do with this!

35:08.690 --> 35:10.442
Then what does this have
to do with?
Him!

35:10.483 --> 35:12.151
He has been acting
all weird with me.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.821
He has been inappropriate
with me.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.949
We have the transcript
from your Internet chat.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.993
You clearly propositioned him.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.495
Yeah. It's because he...

35:23.914 --> 35:25.832
because...

35:25.874 --> 35:27.751
Because what?

35:37.886 --> 35:39.554
In light of your illness,

35:39.596 --> 35:42.849
we're not going
to treat this as a
disciplinary matter,

35:42.891 --> 35:45.143
but we will be speaking
with your family.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.228
And you'll have to commit
to counseling sessions.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.314
Silver,

35:49.355 --> 35:52.191
we just want to help you.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.118
So, what's going on?

36:06.915 --> 36:10.376
Um, I thought that we
weren't gonna do this.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.337
I really want to be with you,

36:12.378 --> 36:14.881
and you really want
to be with me.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.008
And Liam...

36:16.049 --> 36:17.467
he's made it really clear

36:17.509 --> 36:18.927
he wants nothing to do

36:18.969 --> 36:20.219
with either of us.
