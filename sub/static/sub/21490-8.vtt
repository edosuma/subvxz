I have to pee, and how are
things with you and Todd?

00:04.390 --> 00:06.572

I started introducing him

00:06.620 --> 00:08.559
to the Denise Richards film "Canon".

00:08.574 --> 00:10.866
Last night, we watched

or as happy as I can be.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.880
I've been feeling like shit lately.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.475
Oh! A pizza place.

00:17.541 --> 00:18.875
They have to let me use
their bathroom.

00:18.922 --> 00:20.560
And eat their pizza.
At different times.

00:20.636 --> 00:22.448
Ha, look at me. I'm
the queen of England.

00:22.715 --> 00:23.941
Hey, where's your restroom?

00:24.048 --> 00:25.614
Sorry. Employees only.

00:25.672 --> 00:27.772
But... I'm pregnant.

00:27.931 --> 00:29.051
Yeah, she's pregnant.

00:29.231 --> 00:30.466
You are?

00:31.872 --> 00:33.672
- Oh, of course you are.
- Okay.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.744
- It's in the basement.
- Let me help you down the stairs.

00:35.791 --> 00:37.424
Hey, be careful with my
wife on those stairs.

00:46.529 --> 00:47.971
Are you dead?

I read an interview with her.

01:19.606 --> 01:21.575
She said she kept coming

01:46.082 --> 01:48.032
So I'm facing a moral conundrum:

01:49.815 --> 01:51.929
That's your moral conundrum?

things, like over here...

06:32.632 --> 06:34.873

06:35.200 --> 06:37.540

09:02.038 --> 09:04.004
What a great idea to get together.

09:04.051 --> 09:06.820
I just remember I was so
happy when we did shows.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.436
Melissa, remember that sketch we did...

09:08.483 --> 09:10.300
Oh, the nacho sketch? Yes!

09:10.347 --> 09:12.270
I don't theeenk so!

09:12.330 --> 09:15.835
I don't theeenk so!

09:16.065 --> 09:18.360
Do you guys remember my
bit about Carol Channing

09:18.407 --> 09:20.255
at the dentist? She was like, "Hey"...

09:20.302 --> 09:22.125
Ray, how old is your baby?

09:22.172 --> 09:24.280
Uh, he's six weeks, and we already think

09:24.327 --> 09:26.396
he has a learning disability, so...
yeah.

09:26.444 --> 09:27.481
Oh, wow.

09:27.528 --> 09:29.661
Hello, molars!

09:29.876 --> 09:33.320
Carol Channing.

09:35.699 --> 09:38.206
Hey, remember that time
we went to Calgary

09:38.275 --> 09:39.884
and they were like, "No improv allowed"?

09:39.931 --> 09:42.060
We were pretty fucking rad.

09:42.107 --> 09:43.782
- Oh, I have to grab this.
- I'm sorry.

09:45.041 --> 09:46.330
It's like, "Speak English."

09:48.017 --> 09:49.203
Hey, what's up?

09:49.250 --> 09:50.931
I'm in the hotel.

09:51.105 --> 09:53.186
I can't sleep, but Todd can,

09:53.233 --> 09:54.796
which means this is a "me" problem

09:54.843 --> 09:56.503
and not an "us" problem.

09:56.550 --> 09:58.154
"This is Us" is a big problem.

09:58.258 --> 09:59.787
Why don't I just meet you in the lobby

09:59.834 --> 10:02.196
with a sock full of Klonopin
and you can Cosby yourself?

10:02.243 --> 10:04.778
I don't want to tear you away
from your improv reunion.

10:04.825 --> 10:06.994
It's okay. I don't think
they're very happy to see me.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.332
Maybe they never liked me

10:08.379 --> 10:10.680
and we were all just so
high, I didn't notice.

10:10.937 --> 10:12.725
P.S. Why did I stop smoking pot?

10:12.772 --> 10:14.261
Because you were having panic attacks

10:14.308 --> 10:16.718
and decided you should have
your own show on Adult Swim.

10:16.765 --> 10:18.802
Right. You know, maybe I was just happy

10:18.849 --> 10:21.674
because of that whole improv
philosophy of "yes, and."

10:21.721 --> 10:23.358
Maybe you should try saying "yes, and"

10:23.405 --> 10:24.694
to whatever they're saying now.

10:24.742 --> 10:26.108
What's the worst that could happen?

10:26.155 --> 10:28.505
I don't know, I could end up
making the sequel to "Don't Think Twice"?

10:28.552 --> 10:31.111
Ooh. Maybe that's on pay-per-view here.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.607
If that doesn't make me fall asleep,

10:32.654 --> 10:34.286
then I've already died and I'm a ghost.

10:36.556 --> 10:38.749
Will, while we're coming clean,

10:38.796 --> 10:41.431
I did steal your mullet wig.

10:41.478 --> 10:43.151
Oh!

10:43.198 --> 10:45.572
All right, during the
improv marathon of '02,

10:45.619 --> 10:48.048
I initiated a scene
with a premise in mind.

10:50.130 --> 10:53.765
- Yes, and...
- while we're confessing, um,

10:53.909 --> 10:56.898
Melissa, I fucked your boyfriend.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.439
Jesus.

10:59.596 --> 11:00.694
Julie, that's a big one.

11:00.741 --> 11:02.842
- Wait, which boyfriend?
- Not Ryan.

11:03.313 --> 11:06.666
- Yes, and...
- not Ryan.

11:06.716 --> 11:08.026
Was it Chuck?

11:08.073 --> 11:09.797
Yes, and...

11:09.871 --> 11:12.678
yes, it was Chuck.

11:13.059 --> 11:15.475
I had no clue. When?

11:16.085 --> 11:18.135
Uh...

11:22.561 --> 11:25.213
Christmas Eve, 2000.

11:25.730 --> 11:29.469
Uh... Chuck died that night.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.044
You were the last person
to see him alive.

11:34.282 --> 11:38.498
Yes, and... it has haunted me.

11:39.623 --> 11:40.738
So you were with Chuck

11:40.785 --> 11:42.844
when he fell down those stairs and died.

11:43.009 --> 11:46.298
Oh, is this really why you
wanted us all to get together?

11:46.394 --> 11:48.856
- Yes, and...
- now that we are hanging out,

11:48.903 --> 11:50.030
I'm actually having a good time,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.468
so why don't you guys
come over tomorrow?

11:51.515 --> 11:53.092
We'll watch some tapes of our old shows,

11:53.139 --> 11:55.637
and we can all pretend we don't
notice how fat we've gotten.

11:56.351 --> 11:58.040
Yeah? Yes!

11:58.087 --> 12:00.457
All right! That's what I like to hear.

12:00.504 --> 12:02.604
Hello, molars!

12:06.972 --> 12:08.915
Well, neutral
territory didn't help.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.697
- What?
- You were asleep all night.

12:10.744 --> 12:12.605
No, I felt bad I suggested the hotel,

12:12.652 --> 12:13.958
so I just pretended.

12:14.005 --> 12:16.140
You stayed motionless for seven hours?

12:16.187 --> 12:18.523
Who are you, Denise Richards
in "Starship Troopers"?

12:18.570 --> 12:20.339
Should we just cut our
losses and go home?

12:20.386 --> 12:23.489
I can't. I Airbnb-ed my place
for the whole weekend.

12:23.573 --> 12:25.181
I keep forgetting how broke you are.

12:25.228 --> 12:28.455
- Oh, that's funny.
- I think about it constantly.

12:28.502 --> 12:30.658
All right, here's a pitch.

12:31.188 --> 12:33.761
Why don't we just wear ourselves
out till we have to sleep?

12:33.808 --> 12:35.579
What's the most exhausting
thing you can think of?

12:35.626 --> 12:37.276
We can call my cousin
Jeannie and ask her

12:37.323 --> 12:39.007
why she took a break from social media.

12:39.079 --> 12:40.167
Or...

12:40.214 --> 12:43.148
there's nothing more exhausting
than tourist bullshit, right?

12:43.409 --> 12:44.705
Oh, my God.

12:44.753 --> 12:46.704
We could pretend like we're
tourists for the day.

12:46.752 --> 12:48.265
I could be someone who
owns a piece of clothing

12:48.313 --> 12:49.337
- from Old Navy...
- Yes.

12:49.384 --> 12:51.681
And you could be a teenage girl
who can't get an abortion.

12:51.728 --> 12:53.036
Yeah!

12:55.728 --> 12:58.821
Hi, I'm Todd. We're from New Mexico.

12:58.958 --> 12:59.935
- Oh, hey, Todd.
- Oh!

12:59.982 --> 13:01.262
- Hello.
- Hi, we've never been

13:01.309 --> 13:03.133
to the big city, so we're very scared.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.530
Oh, yeah? We've been here
a whole mess of times.

13:05.578 --> 13:06.611
Oh, wow.

13:06.658 --> 13:10.635
We just saw the greatest
show: "Gazillion Bubbles."

13:10.682 --> 13:11.891
Though to tell you the truth,

13:11.938 --> 13:13.516
it seemed more like a
gahundred thousand.

13:13.564 --> 13:14.624
Oh!

13:14.671 --> 13:16.960
Yeah, Lucy and I seen that "Othello"

13:17.007 --> 13:19.160
at The Old Vic last year,

13:19.207 --> 13:22.923
and this show made that
look like a hunk of shit.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.121
Oh, well!

13:24.168 --> 13:25.840
Thank you, Ben Brantley.

13:25.887 --> 13:27.589
Hi, Ben.

13:27.646 --> 13:29.457
Hey, if you wanna,

13:29.504 --> 13:31.498
y'all are welcome to
hang out with us today.

13:31.545 --> 13:32.564
Ooh!

13:32.611 --> 13:33.643
Like a couple

13:33.690 --> 13:34.979
of real New Yorkers!

13:36.314 --> 13:38.263
Well, I'm exhausted already!

13:40.453 --> 13:42.104
And then after the eighth time

13:42.151 --> 13:44.913
that Aunt Scorpion swallowed
a bag of needles,

13:44.960 --> 13:46.808
we started taking her
to the veterinarian.

13:46.855 --> 13:49.291
I could listen to your stories all day.

13:49.338 --> 13:50.811
And I could tell them all day,

13:50.858 --> 13:53.952
but unfortunately, I have to
get back to my photo studio.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.713
I've got to develop
some creep shots I took

13:55.760 --> 13:57.190
of Sigourney Weaver on the D train.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.121
You have a photo studio?

13:59.168 --> 14:00.677
Yeah, it's a little hobby I picked up

14:00.724 --> 14:02.825
back when Jib Jab wanted
to be in "Hustler."

14:02.872 --> 14:06.580
Ah. Well, maybe you could take
some pictures of me. I'd pay.

14:06.627 --> 14:08.827
- Oh, sure, doll.
- You want the full beav?

14:08.874 --> 14:10.803
I mean, I never pictured
you as a Hustler Honey,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.905
but I bet I'd change my mind
once you opened your legs.

14:13.952 --> 14:16.362
Oh, actually, I just
need an author photo.

14:16.409 --> 14:18.216
So tits, glasses, pencil in mouth.

14:18.263 --> 14:19.811
- That's it. That's it.
- Yup, got it.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.415
Well, I can't wait to get some closure

14:21.462 --> 14:24.127
on whether Jib Jab actually
made it into "Hustler."

14:24.174 --> 14:26.777
- Did she?
- Well, they approved her,

14:26.942 --> 14:28.782
and then her eyes fell.

14:29.460 --> 14:30.910
- Speak up.
- Her eyes fell.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.885
- Wonderful.
- Right out of they sockets.

14:32.932 --> 14:34.258
Mm!

14:34.305 --> 14:37.119

Noodles, intrigue is afoot.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.744
Sorry about that.

15:19.791 --> 15:22.348
So the food delivery guy sold me this.

15:22.406 --> 15:24.967
I hope it's pot.

Um, listen, Julie, I don't
want to bring the mood down,

15:46.934 --> 15:48.677
but I'm in touch with Chuck's mom,

15:48.724 --> 15:51.108
and we still have so many
questions about his death.

15:51.412 --> 15:52.792
Oh, yeah, that's normal.

15:52.839 --> 15:56.667
But, you know, we all came
here to watch the tape, so...

15:57.573 --> 15:59.664
Hello, molars!

16:01.164 --> 16:03.359
Um, do you remember Chuck's last words?

16:03.406 --> 16:04.747
Did he mention his mom?

16:04.794 --> 16:07.214
- Yes, and...
- he forgives her.

16:12.664 --> 16:15.150
Oh, yeah! This is definitely pot!

- What's that?
- Yes!

16:23.198 --> 16:25.627
So you said that your aunt
didn't have any fingertips.

16:25.674 --> 16:27.243
- Is that right?
- Correct.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.455

And then you notice,
"Oh, my God, what time is it?"

16:40.939 --> 16:42.176
And you spill the cocktail.

16:42.223 --> 16:44.243
Do you come from a line of alcoholics?

16:44.290 --> 16:46.531

- I'm exhausted.

16:53.410 --> 16:54.963

- Yes! A nap!
- The snack of sleep!

16:57.774 --> 17:00.608
We can't afford a full
meal, so we'll just graze.

17:00.655 --> 17:02.460
Aw, Ed.

17:02.507 --> 17:04.579
The fruitcakes are sleepy.

17:04.626 --> 17:05.776
Oh!

17:05.823 --> 17:07.684
My favorite thing about a nap

17:07.731 --> 17:11.334
is dreaming about sleeping
next to this big guy.

17:11.484 --> 17:15.930
I love sleeping next to Lucy.

17:15.977 --> 17:18.032
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.488
Did you two ever have a problem
falling asleep together?

17:20.535 --> 17:23.134
Absolutely not.

17:23.181 --> 17:24.693
So how long have you been married?

17:24.740 --> 17:26.928
- We're not married.
- I'm paying her.

17:26.974 --> 17:29.584
I am Lucy, the vacation prostitute.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.347
- Yes, you are.
- Whoo!

17:31.394 --> 17:34.020
My wife, on the other hand,
is a fucking nightmare.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.672
I can't sleep in the same
room with that woman.

17:36.719 --> 17:39.810
Why did I marry someone
that I can't sleep next to?

17:39.857 --> 17:40.843
Yes, we get it.

17:40.890 --> 17:43.060
Thank you for illustrating
our fears with examples.

17:43.156 --> 17:46.711
So which room we gonna go back to,

17:46.772 --> 17:49.381
yours or ourn?

17:49.753 --> 17:51.224
- What?
- Huh?

17:51.271 --> 17:53.594
Well, why the hell would
you spend the day with us

17:53.641 --> 17:56.215
if you didn't wanna swing?

17:56.262 --> 17:58.191
Please tell me you're
referring to dancing along

17:58.238 --> 17:59.530
to the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

17:59.577 --> 18:02.150
- No, group sex.
- Partner swapping.

18:02.197 --> 18:04.391
Course, it'd be you two
double-teaming her.

18:04.438 --> 18:07.793
I'd watch and do my business in a sock.

18:11.009 --> 18:14.143
- I'm cornfused.
- Why are we in a hospital?

18:14.214 --> 18:17.256
And why don't I have a
show on Adult Swim?

18:17.303 --> 18:19.171
And why are we in a hospital?

18:19.218 --> 18:20.667
Chuck didn't get along with his mom,

18:20.714 --> 18:22.475
and you have new information.

18:22.522 --> 18:25.332
So we're here to give her closure.

18:25.975 --> 18:28.888
Meet Chuck's mom.

18:28.935 --> 18:30.549
Oh, no.

18:32.351 --> 18:33.942
Oh, she's really sick.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.390
Hi, Mrs. Chuck.

18:35.437 --> 18:36.766
You're gonna be the second member

18:36.813 --> 18:38.527
of your family I watch die.

18:38.574 --> 18:40.423
Julie, please.

18:40.470 --> 18:42.895
You were with my Chuck?

18:43.235 --> 18:45.202
What were his last words?

18:45.640 --> 18:50.817
They were, "Tell my
mother I forgive her."

18:50.929 --> 18:53.742
The last words he said to me were,

18:53.789 --> 18:55.199
"I'll never forgive you."

18:55.246 --> 18:57.135
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, lady.

18:57.182 --> 18:58.216
That's what he said.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.419
If Chuckles had to die

18:59.466 --> 19:00.761
falling down a flight of stairs,

19:00.808 --> 19:03.509
at least he was in the
company of his lover

19:03.556 --> 19:08.023
and, yes, on a night his
beloved Yankees won.

19:08.070 --> 19:12.239
I remember. He was so
happy about those Yankees

19:12.286 --> 19:14.923
winning the ball game.

19:14.970 --> 19:16.500
Anyway, closure, closure.

19:16.547 --> 19:17.509
What a wonderful thing.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.577
Okay, bye!

19:18.624 --> 19:20.040
Hold on!

19:20.389 --> 19:23.887
Chuck hated the Yankees almost
as much as he hated redheads!

19:23.934 --> 19:25.912
Plus, it was Christmas Eve.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.638
There are no baseball
games on Christmas Eve.

19:28.685 --> 19:29.945
Julie, what's going on?

19:29.992 --> 19:31.431
I'll tell you what's going on!

19:31.478 --> 19:33.914
This cunt murdered my son!

19:35.507 --> 19:36.831
Gaby, I'm sorry to drag you here

19:36.878 --> 19:37.935
in the middle of the night,

19:37.982 --> 19:39.760
but I found out something
very disturbing.

19:40.793 --> 19:42.389
Every Viewer Like You

19:42.826 --> 19:44.723
lives at the same address.

19:45.344 --> 19:47.420
So I went there in the dead of night,

19:47.467 --> 19:49.531
and you'll never believe
who lives there.

19:49.943 --> 19:52.623
- Larry the Cable Guy.
- Larry the Cable... Guy.

19:52.670 --> 19:53.625
You knew?

19:53.672 --> 19:55.152
Everyone knows Viewers Like You

19:55.199 --> 19:56.880
is a pseudonym for Larry the Cable Guy.

19:56.927 --> 19:58.923
- We just don't talk about it.
- Why the secret?

19:58.970 --> 20:01.099
I think people should
know what a hero he is.

20:01.146 --> 20:02.375
Wrong!

20:02.422 --> 20:03.993
Our fans don't want to know

20:04.040 --> 20:06.491
Larry the Cable Guy is behind PBS

20:06.538 --> 20:09.041
any more than his fans want
to know how passionate he is

20:09.088 --> 20:11.285
about importing British
television shows.

20:11.332 --> 20:14.205
Now, are you gonna
forget all about this?

20:14.252 --> 20:15.975
Yes! Yes.

20:16.113 --> 20:18.598
- I mean, forget what?
- That's right, kitty cat.
