00:05.206 --> 00:12.896
TEAM PLAY, A POWER ALLIANCE
BETWEEN THE FOUR TEAMS, THE

00:12.930 --> 00:16.309
THREE REMAINING QUEENS AND A
SINGLE ACE WAS BORN.

00:16.344 --> 00:18.827
>> I LIKE THE ROYAL FLUSH
ALLIANCE.

00:18.861 --> 00:22.344
>> Announcer: THERE ALSO WAS
THESIX PERSON COOKOUT FLYING

00:22.379 --> 00:23.827
COMPLETELY UNDER THE RADAR.

00:23.861 --> 00:26.344
>> WE CAN'T HAVE ANY RAIN ON THE
COOKOUT.

00:26.379 --> 00:27.585
WE ALL HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.379
WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE
GRILLING EVERYBODY ELSE, NOT

00:30.413 --> 00:31.448
EACH OTHER.

00:31.481 --> 00:34.137
>> Announcer: WITH THE HOUSE
UNITED TO BLINDSIDE.

00:34.171 --> 00:37.000
>> EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE GOING
AS PLANNED THIS WEEK, THE ROYAL

00:37.033 --> 00:41.033
FLUSH HAS A VOTE TO GET OUT
BREN.

00:41.067 --> 00:44.171
>> TEAM STARTED STRATEGIZING FOR
THE FUTURE AND THE KINGS ARE IN

00:44.206 --> 00:45.412
EVERYONE'S CROSSHAIRS.

00:45.448 --> 00:50.412
>> WHERE ARE WE, BECAUSE I'M
KSH.

00:50.448 --> 00:54.551
>> NO MATTER WHAT, ONE OF THE
KINGS HAS TO GO.

00:54.585 --> 00:57.930
>> Announcer: BUT THE KINGS
HAD TARGETS OF THEIR OWN.

00:57.965 --> 01:01.033
>> SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE ARE LEANING
TOWARDS WHITNEY BEING A TARGET

01:01.067 --> 01:03.067
SO THE QUESTION IS WHO GOES
NEXT.

01:03.103 --> 01:04.688
>> IT HAS GOT TO BE HANNAH.

01:04.724 --> 01:06.412
>> HANNAH I THINK IS SMART.

01:06.448 --> 01:09.620
SHE IS PLAYING A GOOD GAME,
LAYING LOW ONLY ON PURPOSE, I

01:09.655 --> 01:11.206
THINK SHE SAY HUGE THREAT.

01:11.240 --> 01:17.379
>> Announcer: PUTTING
X-ZAVIER BETWEEN A ROCK AND HARD

01:17.412 --> 01:18.655
PLACE.

01:18.688 --> 01:22.620
>> MY GOAL IS I CAN'T STICK UP
FOR HANNAH AND SAY NO, WE SHURNT

01:22.655 --> 01:24.896
GO FOR HANNAH BECAUSE IT MIGHT
TURN HEADS.

01:24.930 --> 01:27.343
>> Announcer: SO WITH THE
FLIGHT ATTENDANT REACHING HIS

01:27.379 --> 01:28.585
FINAL DESTINATION.

01:28.620 --> 01:34.620
>> Julie: BY A VOTE OF 11-0,
BRENT, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM "THE

01:34.655 --> 01:35.793
BIG BANG THEORY" HOUSE.

01:35.826 --> 01:39.585
>> Announcer: THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION WAS MORE

01:39.620 --> 01:43.343
CRUCIAL THAN EVER.

01:43.378 --> 01:45.206
AND CHRISTIAN SECURED SAFETY FOR
HIS TEAM.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.930
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS.

01:47.965 --> 01:51.481
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

01:51.516 --> 01:54.275
>> Announcer: TONIGHT WHO
WILL ALYSSA'S MAIN SCWEAZ TARGET

01:54.310 --> 01:55.516
FOR EVICTION.

01:55.551 --> 01:59.343
AND WILL THE WILDCARD COMP THROW
A WRENCH IN HIS PLANS? PLUS

01:59.378 --> 02:02.688
IT'S THE BIGGEST WILDCARD
DECISION OF THE SEASON.

02:02.724 --> 02:03.793
>> OH MY!

02:03.826 --> 02:16.723
>> Announcer: ALL THIS RIGHT
NOW ON "BIG BROTHER".

02:16.758 --> 02:23.793
>> AMAZING.

02:23.826 --> 02:28.103
>> I DIDN'T KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY
WERE.

02:28.137 --> 02:29.033
>> WHOOO.

02:29.068 --> 02:31.481
MAN, I NEEDED THIS, THIS FEELS
INCREDIBLE.

02:31.516 --> 02:33.516
THE KINGS ARE SUCH A POWERHOUSE.

02:33.550 --> 02:38.310
ONLY TEAM WITH FOUR PEM LEFT AND
EVERYONE LIKES TO HATE US.

02:38.343 --> 02:42.343
SO WE ARE AN OBVIOUS TARGET FOR
THE REMAINING TEAMS BUT THE

02:42.378 --> 02:43.793
KINGS ARE HERE TO STAY.

02:43.826 --> 02:46.067
>> LET'S GO, ANOTHER WIN FOR THE
KINGS.

02:46.103 --> 02:47.723
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SEE THE COMPETITION FROM THE

02:47.758 --> 02:51.688
ANGLE THAT I DID, THE JOKERS,
THE ACES AND THE KINGS WERE ALL

02:51.723 --> 02:58.378
NECK AND NECK BUT LUCKILY KINGS
WERE ABLE TO BRING THIS ONE

02:58.413 --> 02:59.206
HOME.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.481
>> Julie: CHRISTIAN,
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:00.516 --> 03:03.861
>> FEELS GREAT TO BE SAFE,
ESPECIALLY AFTER COMING OFF A

03:03.895 --> 03:04.965
SUCCESSFUL H.O.H.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.068
THE INTENDED TARGET FOR THE
WEEK, BRENT, WENT HOME.

03:08.103 --> 03:13.000
BUT DURING MY CONVERSATION WITH
THE KINGS LAST WEEK, TWO MAIN

03:13.033 --> 03:18.137
NAMES WERE THROWN OUT BESIDES
BRENT ARE WHITNEY AND HANNAH.

03:18.171 --> 03:22.171
SO BETWEEN THOSE TWO OPTIONS, I
WOULD PREFER THE TARGET BE

03:22.205 --> 03:23.343
PLACED ON WHITNEY.

03:23.378 --> 03:25.655
>> WHAT HAPPENED US TO LAYING
OUR PUZZLE OUT.

03:25.688 --> 03:29.310
>> THERE WAS TALK ABOUT GOING
AFTER THE KINGS THIS WEEK.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.655
SPECIFICALLY CHRISTIAN AND
ALYSSA BUT NOW THAT CHRISTIAN IS

03:32.688 --> 03:37.688
H.O.H. I GUESS IT'S ROYAL FLUSH
ALL THE WAY.

03:37.723 --> 03:39.758
>> OH GREAT, YOU GET TO UNPACK.

03:39.793 --> 03:41.378
>> I GET TO UNPACK.

03:41.413 --> 03:46.723
>> GUESS WHO'S BACK, AMERICA!

03:46.758 --> 03:50.171
OH I HOPE BRENT ENJOYEDED THAT
BLIND SIDE.

03:50.206 --> 03:51.758
>> I'M SAFE!

03:51.793 --> 03:54.516
YES, I'M SAFE!

03:54.550 --> 03:56.481
>> HE'S OUT, YEAH I'M SAFE.

03:56.516 --> 03:58.033
LET'S GO, BABY.

03:58.067 --> 04:06.688
OH MY GOD, I'M SO EXCITED.

04:06.723 --> 04:07.826
>> I GOT APPLE.

04:07.861 --> 04:09.343
>> WHY DO YOU HAVE THE APPLES.

04:09.378 --> 04:12.793
>> I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

04:12.826 --> 04:15.793
>> WE'RE MEETING, RIGHT?

04:15.826 --> 04:18.343
>> GET THE QUEEN OUT OF HERE.

04:18.379 --> 04:20.033
>> WE'RE JUMPING AN TURNING
AGAIN.

04:20.067 --> 04:23.206
WE'RE JUMPING AND TURNING AGAIN.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.757
>> THEY HATE US.

04:24.793 --> 04:28.379
>> I'M SCO EX-- EXCITED THAT
CHRISTIAN WON H.O.H.

04:28.413 --> 04:31.067
THE KUNGS ARE KILLING IT.

04:31.103 --> 04:37.723
THAT MEANS ALL OF THE KINGS ARE
SAFE THIS WEEK, ME, XAVIER,

04:37.757 --> 04:39.689
SARAH BETH AND CHRISTIAN.

04:39.723 --> 04:40.862
>> WE HAVE BEEN ON THE BLOCK.

04:40.896 --> 04:42.689
>> WE HAVE TO KEEP WINNING.

04:42.723 --> 04:45.516
>> CHRISTIAN WINS THE COMP AND I
HAVE THE SOCIAL GAME SO I'M

04:45.550 --> 04:51.757
DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE A LOT
OF INCITE IN WHO HE IS THINKING

04:51.793 --> 04:55.172
THIS WEEK.

04:55.206 --> 04:59.654
>> WE'RE SO BAD, WE'RE SO BAD.

04:59.689 --> 05:01.137
>> OH, SORRY.

05:01.172 --> 05:03.379
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

05:03.413 --> 05:07.206
>> TRYING TO PUT THE SUITCASE
BACK.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.240
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.689
>> THAT'S IT.

05:09.723 --> 05:10.896
>> THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT ROLL.

05:10.930 --> 05:15.447
>> TASK'S IT.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.516
ARE YOU OKAY.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.757
>> NO, I JUST REALLY WANTED TO
WIN.

05:17.793 --> 05:19.793
>> I KNOW.

05:19.826 --> 05:25.033
>> I'M SO OVER IT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IN THIS GAME.

05:25.067 --> 05:27.689
>> D, IT'S OKAY.

05:27.723 --> 05:28.103
>> OKAY.

05:28.137 --> 05:28.862
>> IT'S OKAY.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.274
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:30.310 --> 05:31.793
LIFE HAPPENS.

05:31.826 --> 05:32.206
>> I KNOW.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.481
>> IT'S OKAY.

05:33.516 --> 05:36.965
>> I KNOW, ONCE AGAIN, THEY'RE
GOING TO COME FOR US.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.723
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO COME FOR US.

05:39.757 --> 05:40.862
>> WE'LL SEE.

05:40.896 --> 05:42.550
>> I'M ANNOYED THAT THE KINGS
ARE IN POWER ONCE AGAIN.

05:42.586 --> 05:46.481
AT THIS POINT THE JOKERS HAVE
BEEN ON THE BLOCK FOR THE LAST

05:46.516 --> 05:48.757
TWO WEEKS.

05:48.793 --> 05:52.379
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE A
PAWN AND ON THE BLOCK ONCE

05:52.413 --> 05:53.103
AGAIN.

05:53.137 --> 05:54.274
>> DON'T BEAT YOURSELF ABOUT IT.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.172
>> NO, I CAN'T BECAUSE THEY WILL
LACK AT IT AS A REASON.

05:56.206 --> 05:59.550
>> BUT YOU BETTER GO OUT
THERE OUT THERE AND BE HAPPY,

05:59.586 --> 06:01.723
PLEASE, FOR TONIGHT, AT LEAST.

06:01.757 --> 06:02.723
>> I WANTED TO WIN THIS H.O.H.

06:02.757 --> 06:03.793
SO BADLY.

06:03.826 --> 06:06.343
I FEEL UNSURE ABOUT CHRISTIAN
BEING THE NEW H.O.H.

06:06.379 --> 06:09.033
COULD PUT ME UP ON THE BLOCK IF
HE WANTED TO.

06:09.067 --> 06:15.343
BECAUSE WE DON'T TALK GAME TO
EACH OTHER.

06:15.379 --> 06:20.033
>> MY HEART IS POUNDING BECAUSE
LIKE NOW I HAVE RESPONSIBILITY

06:20.067 --> 06:28.862
TO MY FANS.

06:28.896 --> 06:31.206
>> WHAT'S UP?

06:31.240 --> 06:35.274
>> SO CHRISTIAN IS IN MY
ALLIANCE OF THE ROYAL FLUSH AND

06:35.310 --> 06:42.862
IT IS THE QUEEN AND ALL OF THE
KINGS.

06:42.896 --> 06:44.379
>> THAT ACE UP THE SLEEVE.

06:44.413 --> 06:48.862
>> BUT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED IF
THE RIGHT PEOPLE GET SAFETY IN

06:48.896 --> 06:53.930
THE WILDCARD COMP, THAT I COULD
TOUCH THE BOX AS A PAWN.

06:53.965 --> 06:55.965
I WILL BE COMPETING IN THE
WILDCARD COMP.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.896
HAVE I TO WIN IT.

07:00.930 --> 07:13.550
>> WITHIN CHRISTIAN AND I ARE
BOTH IN A ROYAL FLUSH ALLIANCE.

07:13.586 --> 07:17.172
SO I DO FEEL RELATIVELY SAFE
THIS WEEK BUT THINGS ARE NOT

07:17.206 --> 07:19.413
LOOKING GOOD FOR MY TEAM.

07:19.447 --> 07:21.413
IT'S HARD FIGURING OUT WHAT IS
BEST FOR MY PERSONAL GAME.

07:21.447 --> 07:24.343
DO I GO ALL THE WAY WITH THE
ROYAL FLUSH ALLIANCE AND TRUST

07:24.379 --> 07:28.413
THAT THEY HAVE MY BACK OR DO I
KEEP TRYING TO FIGHT FOR HANNAH

07:28.447 --> 07:32.067
AND WHITNEY AND MAKE SURE THEY
STAY IN THE GAME AND MAYBE WE

07:32.103 --> 07:33.862
CAN HAVE THIS POWERFUL TRIO.

07:33.896 --> 07:40.862
NOTHING EVER SEEMS TO GO EASY
FOR ME.

07:40.896 --> 07:44.172
>> I FEEL OKAY WITH KISSIAN
WINNING H.O.H.

07:44.206 --> 07:47.620
TO BE HONEST I DON'T KNOW THAT
MUCH ABOUT HIM ON A PERSONAL

07:47.654 --> 07:48.826
LEVEL.

07:48.862 --> 07:52.862
I DON'T REALLY CARE, ON A
PERSONAL LEVEL BUT I AM WORRIED

07:52.896 --> 07:56.793
THAT I COULD GO UP IN A PAWN
CAPACITY.

07:56.826 --> 08:00.310
I'M HOPING HE SEES ME AS A VERY
TRUST WORTHY PERSON AND FOR THAT

08:00.343 --> 08:03.482
REASON HE DOESN'T PUT ME ON THE
BLOCK AS A PAWN SO YOURS TRULY

08:03.516 --> 08:12.000
HAS TO GET TO WORK SO I CAN
NUDGE KISSIAN IN A DIRECTION,

08:12.033 --> 08:16.757
AKA, AWAY FROM ME.

08:16.793 --> 08:19.826
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING I JUST
REALLY WANTED TO WIN.

08:19.862 --> 08:23.172
SO I'M DEFEATED AND JUST SO
LIKE.

08:23.206 --> 08:25.379
>> WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE OUR
COMP.

08:25.413 --> 08:29.964
>> I WANTED US TO WIN BECAUSE
TWO WEEKS IN A ROW, WE GO ON THE

08:30.000 --> 08:30.689
BLOCK.

08:30.723 --> 08:32.758
WE'RE LITERALLY THE UNDERDOGS.

08:32.793 --> 08:40.274
AND WE'RE NOT DOING WITH ONE
H.O.H., WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO

08:40.309 --> 08:40.724
H.O.H.'S.

08:40.758 --> 08:41.793
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

08:41.826 --> 08:43.688
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE TARGET IS.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.758
>> EACH WEEK SO FAR SINCE WE
HAVE GOT HERE THERE HAS BEEN A

08:46.793 --> 08:48.551
VERY CLEAR TARGET OF WHO NEEDS
TO GO OUT.

08:48.586 --> 08:52.861
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT WEEK THAT WE'VE HAD SO

08:52.895 --> 08:57.344
FAR BECAUSE I REALLY HAVE NO
IDEA WHO CHRISTIAN WILL

08:57.379 --> 08:58.758
NOMINATE.

08:58.793 --> 09:02.240
IT IS A SCARY GAME.

09:02.274 --> 09:16.206
>> I'M GOING TO-- -- WE'RE THE
BEST TEAM, THAT'S WHY WE ARE IN

09:16.240 --> 09:18.965
HERE TWO WEEKS IN A ROW.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.274
>> YOU HAVING TO PRESS THE
BUTTON, SO NOW IT FALLS ON YOU.

09:22.309 --> 09:23.965
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.517
>> WHY AM I, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO

09:27.551 --> 09:28.793
DO, I HAVE NO IDEA.

09:28.826 --> 09:29.965
>> IT'S STILL THE SAME PLAN.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.861
>> I THINK IT'S STILL THE SAME.

09:31.895 --> 09:33.102
>> YEAH.

09:33.136 --> 09:34.895
>> NOTHING REALLY-- I THINK IT
IS IS THE SAME PLAN BUT IT IS

09:34.931 --> 09:37.102
MORE SO WHAT YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH.

09:37.136 --> 09:40.895
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT BOTH
OF THEM UP.

09:40.931 --> 09:46.274
AND THEN SEE-- DETERMINE THROUGH
THE WEEK.

09:46.309 --> 09:48.826
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE WANTING
WHITNEY RATHER THAN HANNAH SO IF

09:48.861 --> 09:52.102
YOU LEAVE WHITNEY NEXT WEEK,
PEOPLE MIGHT WANT HER TO GO UP

09:52.136 --> 09:53.379
RATHER THAN US.

09:53.413 --> 09:57.309
AND EVERYONE HAS SAID THEY WANT
WHITNEY OUT, THEY WANT WHITNEY

09:57.344 --> 09:58.517
OUT.

09:58.551 --> 10:01.172
NO ONE HAS SAID HANNAH SO WHY
NOT TAKE THE GIRL NO ONE IS

10:01.206 --> 10:04.861
SAYING WHEN THERE ANOTHER PERSON
OTHER THAN US PEOPLE ARE WANTING

10:04.895 --> 10:05.931
OUT.

10:05.965 --> 10:07.965
>> PERSONALLY I WOULD RATHER GET
RID OF WHITNEY.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.344
>> I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

10:09.379 --> 10:13.172
>> NOW THAT WE WON THIS, IT'S US
EF EVERY WEEK.

10:13.206 --> 10:15.344
WE'RE ALWAYS THE MAIN TAR DPET.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.344
>> I'M LEANING A CERTAIN WAY.

10:17.379 --> 10:19.724
>> GAMEWISE NEXT WEEK INSTEAD OF
TWO OF US BEING UP, IT MIGHT BE

10:19.758 --> 10:21.033
ONE OF US AND WHITNEY.

10:21.067 --> 10:23.793
NO ONE IS GOING TO PUT UP
HANNAH.

10:23.826 --> 10:26.965
>> CHRISTIAN DEFINITELY HAS A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A BIG

10:27.000 --> 10:30.172
TARGET OUT IT IS JUST MORE SO
WHICH TARGET WE SHOULD GO FOR.

10:30.206 --> 10:31.240
HANNAH IS REALLY SMART.

10:31.274 --> 10:33.586
HANNAH KNOWS THIS GAME BETTER
THAN ANYONE.

10:33.620 --> 10:37.826
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
UNDERESTIMATE HANNAH AND WHAT

10:37.861 --> 10:40.102
SHE COULD BE CAPABLE OF.

10:40.136 --> 10:43.517
>> I THINK WHITNEY COULD BE
MANIPULATED WHERE SHE COULDN'T.

10:43.551 --> 10:45.931
>> YOU DON'T THINK HANNAH COULD.

10:45.965 --> 10:50.379
>> NO, NO ONE WHO THINKS SHE CAN
BE MAN I GATE-- MANIPULATED ARE

10:50.413 --> 10:55.000
YOU UNDERESTIMATING HER, YOU CAN
TELL HE SHOW KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT

10:55.033 --> 10:56.172
SHE IS DOING.

10:56.206 --> 10:59.344
>> I WOULD LIKE CHRISTIAN TO
SEND HANNAH OUT THE DOOR, I

10:59.379 --> 11:02.826
THINK SHE WOULD PLAY BETTER IN
PHYSICAL COMPS, I KNOW IN

11:02.861 --> 11:04.067
INTELLECTUAL COMPS.

11:04.102 --> 11:06.931
SHE HAS A BETTER SOCIAL GAME
THAN WHITNEY Sú OF COURSE I WANT

11:06.965 --> 11:08.172
HANNAH TO GO OVER HERE.

11:08.206 --> 11:12.172
>> YOU COULD EASILY MANIPULATE
WHITNEY, HANNA, NO WAY.

11:12.206 --> 11:16.379
I REALLY THINK HANNAH MAKES
SENSE.

11:16.413 --> 11:19.172
>> HANNA IS MY BABY SISTER IN
THIS IMGA.

11:19.206 --> 11:22.551
SHE'S ALSO A MEMBER OF THE
COOKOUT AND SO IT PUTS ME IN A

11:22.586 --> 11:24.413
VERY TRICKY SITUATION.

11:24.447 --> 11:27.826
>> I'M ALWAYS IN TRICKY
SITUATIONS IN THIS DAME HOUSE.

11:27.861 --> 11:32.586
>> NOW SAY WHITNEY WINS WHO ARE
YOU PUTTING UP, NO, WILDCARD.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.758
>> AND SHE TAKES THE WILDCARD.

11:34.793 --> 11:41.067
>> SAY SHE SAVES HANNAH, WHAT
JOKERS ARE YOU GOING TO PUT UP.

11:41.102 --> 11:41.965
>> WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.895
>> LIKE BRITINI AND AZAH, I
DON'T KNOW.

11:44.931 --> 11:47.413
>> WHY NOT BIG D.

11:47.447 --> 11:52.033
>> I THINK THEY WOULD VOTE BIG D
OVER BRITINI OR ANY OTHER.

11:52.067 --> 11:55.136
>> WHITNEY WINNING ITS WILD COMP
AND SAVING HERSELF AND HANNAH

11:55.172 --> 11:58.413
WOULD NOT BE IDEAL BECAUSE I
ONLY HAVE A FEW OPTIONS OUTSIDE

11:58.447 --> 12:02.793
OF ROYAL FLUSH AND THAT LEAVES
THE JOKERS, IF I PUT AZAH AND

12:02.826 --> 12:05.172
BRITINI UP ON THE BLOCK I WOULD
GET LESS BLOOD BECAUSE I WOULD

12:05.206 --> 12:08.344
NOT HAVE TO NOMINATE ANYBODY IN
THE ROYAL FLUSH ALLIANCE.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.447
>> I LOVE US GUYS.

12:10.481 --> 12:11.136
>> WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

12:11.172 --> 12:12.724
>> WE'RE PRETTY COOL, I THINK.

12:12.758 --> 12:14.861
>> I TELL YOU WHO HATES US.

12:14.895 --> 12:15.309
>> AMERICA.

12:15.344 --> 12:15.861
>> ALL THE REST.

12:15.895 --> 12:16.517
>> I THINK EVERYBODY.

12:26.793 --> 12:31.654
I CAN'T GET OVER THIS, MI SO
AMAZED, HAVE I SEEN SOME COMPS.

12:31.688 --> 12:38.102
>> THIS IS I'M GOING TO SWEAT
MY-- OFF WHILE LOOKING HOT.

12:38.136 --> 12:40.895
>> YOU KNOW YOU AREN'T GOING IN
PUBLIC WITH THAT ON.

12:40.931 --> 12:41.447
>> YEAH, I WOULD.

12:41.481 --> 12:42.895
>> YOU GO TO THE GYM.

12:42.931 --> 12:44.102
>> 1,000 PERCENT.

12:44.136 --> 12:46.826
>> WITH A TRAINER AND SAY I'M
HERE TO WORK OUT.

12:46.861 --> 12:49.067
>> I WEAR THIS TO THE GYM.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.033
>> I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHITNEY'S OUTFITS SOMETIMES, SHE

12:52.067 --> 12:56.826
SWEARS IT IS A WORKOUT TOP, BABY
GIRL, THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT TOP.

12:56.861 --> 13:01.481
ALL SHE GOT TO DO IS GO WHOOO
AND THE WHOLE WORLD SEES

13:01.517 --> 13:03.793
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE BEEN
WAITING TO SEE, TO BE HONEST.

13:03.826 --> 13:07.481
I'M JUST SURPRISED THAT YOU WENT
TO THE STORE AND SAID I HAVE TO

13:07.517 --> 13:10.033
GET THIS TOP.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.102
>> YEAH, BUT IT'S CUTE.

13:12.136 --> 13:14.136
>> ANY TIME I WEAR MY SPORTS BRA
WITH THE BUCKLES AND THIS TINY,

13:14.172 --> 13:15.965
I GET SO MUCH-- IN THE HOUSE.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.413
YOU KNOW, I'M SINGLE.

13:17.447 --> 13:21.067
I LIKE TO LOOK CUTE WHEN I WORK
OUT.

13:21.102 --> 13:23.447
BIG D IS MY NUMBER ONE CRITIC.

13:23.481 --> 13:24.309
HE DOESN'T KNOW NOTHING.

13:24.344 --> 13:27.000
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M WEARING A
HOODIE.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.102
I'M HIDING A LITTLE.

13:29.136 --> 13:29.826
>> JUST KIDDING.

13:29.861 --> 13:35.000
>> I'M TRYING TO HIDE A LITTLE.

13:35.033 --> 13:38.240
>> SARAH BETH WOULD YOU
POTENTIALLY WEAR THERE?

13:38.274 --> 13:42.033
AT THE GYM?

13:42.067 --> 13:42.586
>> NO.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.793
>> I TOLD YOU.

13:43.826 --> 13:44.931
>> NO.

13:44.965 --> 13:46.793
>> YOU NEED SOMEONE SOMEBODY
ELSE.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.895
>> HANNAH, WOULD YOU WEAR THIS
TO THE GYM?

13:49.931 --> 13:52.344
LET'S KEEP IT GOING.

13:52.379 --> 13:54.033
LET'S KEEP IT GOING.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.551
ALYSSA, WOULD YOU WEAR THIS TO
THE GYM?

13:56.586 --> 13:57.551
>> SAY NO.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.861
>> SAY YES.

13:58.895 --> 14:02.033
>> THEY'RE TELLING ME TO SAY YES
AND NO, YOU ARE I WILL GIVE YOU

14:02.067 --> 14:03.033
MY HONEST OPINION.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.240
OKAY.

14:05.274 --> 14:06.758
>> OKAY, HONEST OPINION.

14:06.793 --> 14:14.067
>> I WOULD NOT WEAR THAT.

14:14.102 --> 14:21.136
>> TOLD YOU.

14:21.172 --> 14:23.413
>> IF WAS TOUGH BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS

14:23.447 --> 14:26.895
IN SCHOOL BECAUSE I ALWAYS FELT
LIKE I WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

14:26.931 --> 14:32.033
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE, THEY HAVE A
FAMILY BUT I DIDN'T HAVE FAMILY

14:32.067 --> 14:33.067
EITHER.

14:33.102 --> 14:34.826
I SAY I LOVE MI PARENTS AND I
KNOW THEY LOVE ME

14:34.861 --> 14:39.102
UNCONDITIONALLY BUT IT'S NOT,
WE'RE NOT CLOSE.

14:39.136 --> 14:44.000
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

14:44.033 --> 14:47.724
IT IS-- I LIKE LIVE IN LIKE AN
IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLD WHERE THEY

14:47.758 --> 14:50.000
GREW NEWSPAPER CHINA AND BETWEEN
CHINA AND THE U.S. THERE ARE

14:50.033 --> 14:52.000
SUCH DIFFERENT CULTURAL VALUES.

14:52.033 --> 14:54.274
ON LIKE WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO
THEM.

14:54.309 --> 14:58.413
IN CHINA, SOME OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS ARE MONEY,

14:58.447 --> 14:59.551
STATUS.

14:59.586 --> 15:02.000
IN WESTERN CULTURE, YOU ASK
ANYONE WHAT IS IMPORTANT,

15:02.033 --> 15:03.240
EVERYONE SAYS HAPPINESS.

15:03.274 --> 15:05.654
>> CAN I RELATE TO DEREK X A
LOT.

15:05.688 --> 15:08.240
AS A CHILD I GOT MADE FUN OF FOR
MY DARK SKIN.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.481
AND I REALLY GREW UP NOT PROUD
OF WHERE I CAME FROM.

15:11.517 --> 15:15.309
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I BECAME AN
ADULT AND STARTED SEEING OTHER

15:15.344 --> 15:19.274
PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT THAT I
REALIZED THAT I TOO COULD BE

15:19.309 --> 15:20.379
AFRICAN.

15:20.413 --> 15:24.172
I COULD BE AMERICAN, AND BUILD
AND BLAZE MY OWN PATH.

15:24.206 --> 15:28.033
>> THERE IS JUST A HUGE
DISCONNECT CULTURALLY BETWEEN ME

15:28.067 --> 15:29.309
AND MY PARENTS.

15:29.344 --> 15:32.240
AND I DON'T THINK THAT GAP CAN
EVER BE BRIDGED, YOU KNOW, LIKE,

15:32.274 --> 15:35.033
IT'S JUST TOO DIFFERENT IN HOW
THEY WERE RAISED AND HOW LIKE I

15:35.067 --> 15:36.688
WAS RAISED.

15:36.724 --> 15:39.172
I HAVE A DIFFERENT VALUE SYSTEM
THAN MY PARENTS.

15:39.206 --> 15:43.793
BUT I STILL APPRECIATE AND
RESPECT LIKE MY HERITAGE.

15:43.826 --> 15:49.793
BUT WHEN YOU ONLY SEE AUSCHAN
AMERICAN-- ASIAN AMERICANS IN

15:49.826 --> 15:54.033
POPULAR CULTURE REPRESENTED IN
SPECIFIC WAYS, IT CAN ALMOST BE

15:54.067 --> 15:56.793
LIKE YOU HAVE TO STEREOTYPE
YOURSELF, FOR A BIG REASON FOR

15:56.826 --> 16:00.172
ME TO BE ON BIG BROTHER WAS TO
PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE IMAGE

16:00.206 --> 16:01.413
THAT PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT.

16:01.447 --> 16:05.551
>> I WAS APPRECIATED KIND OF
SEEING SOMEONE ON TELEVISION WHO

16:05.586 --> 16:10.067
HAD A PERSONALITY THAT IS
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WOULD

16:10.102 --> 16:10.688
EXPECT.

16:10.724 --> 16:16.758
>> YOU ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE.

16:16.793 --> 16:23.793
>> DIRTY, DIRTY DOG.

16:23.826 --> 16:24.240
>> YES.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.793
>> SHOW TIME.

16:25.826 --> 16:36.206
LET'S GO THIS.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.793
>> HOUSEGUESTS T IS TIME AGAIN
FOR THE WILDCARD COMPETITION.

16:39.826 --> 16:43.793
THE WINNER OF THE WILDCARD COMP
NOT ONLY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

16:43.826 --> 16:48.033
WIN SAFETY FOR THE WEEK BUT
REMEMBER, IT COMES WITH A UNIQUE

16:48.067 --> 16:51.551
WILDCARD DECISION THAT WILL
IMPACT THE GAME.

16:51.586 --> 16:56.172
KINGS, SINCE WE ARE SAFE, NO ONE
FROM OUR TEAM WILL BE COMPETING.

16:56.206 --> 17:00.586
CLAIRE, SINCE YOU ARE THE ONLY
ELIGIBLE MEMBER FROM THE QUEENS,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.000
YOU MUST COMPETE THIS WEEK.

17:03.033 --> 17:05.136
>> EVERYONE ELSE ON MY TEAM HAS
ALREADY PLAYED IN A WILDCARD SO

17:05.172 --> 17:08.172
I AM PLAYING BY DEFAULT SO THAT
IS OKAY WITH ME.

17:08.205 --> 17:12.862
EVEN THOUGH I FEEL PRETTY GOOD
WITH CHRISTIAN.

17:12.895 --> 17:17.034
>> THIS IS BIG BROTHER, ANYTHING
COULD HAPPEN SO I WOULD LOVE THE

17:17.067 --> 17:18.517
SAFETY JUST TO BE SURE.

17:18.550 --> 17:21.550
>> WHITNEY, SINCE YOU ARE THE
ONLY ELIGIBLE MEMBER FROM THE

17:21.586 --> 17:22.964
ACES, YOU TOO MUST COMPETE.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.826
>> MI SO GRATEFUL THAT I
ACTUALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO PLAY

17:25.862 --> 17:28.931
IN THIS WEEK'S WILDCARD
COMPETITION.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.309
I WANT TO WIN THIS JUST TO
ENSURE THAT I DON'T GO ON THE

17:31.344 --> 17:32.550
BLOCK.

17:32.586 --> 17:36.000
I DON'T THINK I WILL BUT YOU
REALLY NEVER KNOW IN THIS GAME.

17:36.034 --> 17:39.654
>> WHITNEY, NO MATTER WHAT
CANNOT WIN THE COMPETITION.

17:39.689 --> 17:42.413
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO NOT HAVE
TO TOUCH THE JOKERS THIS WEEK

17:42.448 --> 17:45.862
AND ONLY HAVE TO PUT THE ACES
UP.

17:45.895 --> 17:49.826
>> JOKERS, SINCE BRITTANY HAS
ALREADY COMPETED, YOU MUST

17:49.862 --> 17:55.103
DECIDE BETWEEN DEREK S AND AZAH.

17:55.136 --> 17:55.792
WHO ARE YOU PICKING.

17:55.826 --> 18:00.792
>> THE JOKERS ARE SENDING ME.

18:00.826 --> 18:01.862
>> AZAH.

18:01.895 --> 18:04.758
>> I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T BEAT
WHITNEY.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.517
HOPEFULLY AZAH CAN WIN AND WIN
OUR TEAM'S SAFETY OR GET SOME

18:07.550 --> 18:11.758
TYPE OF ADVANTAGE THAT CAN
SWITCH UP THIS GAME.

18:11.792 --> 18:15.000
>> OKAY, CLAIRE, WHITNEY, AZAH,
IT'S TIME TO GET WILD!

18:34.067 --> 18:38.309
>> I WALK IN, I SEE MARTINI
GLASSES, I SEE A LOUNGE ON THE

18:38.344 --> 18:40.586
SIDE, SOME PULSE ATING MUSIC.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.586
>> I LOVE MARTINI GLASS.

18:42.619 --> 18:43.792
>> VERY SWANKY.

18:43.826 --> 18:46.586
>> IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE
BEEN TO A CLUB, AND IT LOOKS

18:46.619 --> 18:49.689
PRETTY DARN POPPING.

18:49.723 --> 18:55.136
>> I FEEL PRETTY SAFE THIS WEEK,
I'M IN THE ROYAL FLUSH WITH

18:55.172 --> 18:57.344
CHRISTIAN, THE H.O.H.

18:57.378 --> 19:02.000
BUT I WANT AN ACE OR A JOKER TO
GO HOME THIS WEEK.

19:02.034 --> 19:08.586
SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE ON THEIR
TEAM HAVING THE SAFETY OR HAVING

19:08.619 --> 19:09.758
THE WILDCARD DECISION AM.

19:09.792 --> 19:11.689
>> I WANT TO WIN THIS SO BADLY.

19:11.723 --> 19:12.964
I WANT THIS FOR MY TEAM.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.723
I WANT TO ENSURE SAFETY, SO I AM
PUTTING ALL STOPS FIRST IN

19:18.758 --> 19:25.619
WINNING THIS COMPETITION I WANT
TO WIN IN ORDER TO GIVE MYSELF

19:25.654 --> 19:30.723
SAFETY AND HOPEFULLY KEEP THE
REST OF MY TEAM OF ACES OFF THE

19:30.758 --> 19:31.413
BLOCK.

19:31.448 --> 19:33.275
>> WELCOME TO CLUB BB.

19:33.309 --> 19:37.586
UNFORTUNATELY CLUB BB HAS HAD
ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS.

19:37.619 --> 19:40.378
MY BARTENDER JUST QUIT AND THE
ELECTRICITY IS ON THE FLITS.

19:40.413 --> 19:44.481
THAT MEANS YOU WILL BE MAKING
YOUR OWN DRINKS TONIGHT.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.378
OH AND MAYBE IN THE DARK.

19:47.413 --> 19:48.205
YEAH.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.378
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

19:49.413 --> 19:52.826
ON GO PLACE YOUR OLIVE IN THE
CUP AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR

19:52.862 --> 19:54.067
MARTINI GLASS.

19:54.103 --> 19:57.103
THEN ROLL YOUR OLIVE UP YOUR
GLASS AND ON TO THE TOOTHPICK AT

19:57.136 --> 20:00.136
THE TOP OF THE RIM.

20:00.172 --> 20:01.448
YEAH.

20:01.481 --> 20:08.275
BUT WATCH OUT, AT PREDETERMINED
TIMES THE RIM WILL LIGHTSES WILL

20:08.309 --> 20:10.034
CUT OUT LEAVING YOU IN A
BLACKOUT.

20:10.067 --> 20:14.275
IF THE OLIVE FALLS OFF YOU HAVE
TO START AGAIN.

20:14.309 --> 20:16.931
THE FIRST PERSON TO LAND AN
OLIVE ON THEIR TOOTHPICK WINS

20:16.964 --> 20:18.586
THE GAME.

20:18.619 --> 20:28.654
SO ARE YOU READY TO PLAY OLIVE
SHOOK UP?

20:28.654 --> 20:39.034
SO ARE YOU READY TO PLAY OLIVE
SHOOK UP?

20:39.067 --> 20:42.309
SO FOR THIS PETITION I HAVE TO
TAKE THE OLIVE FROM THE BOTTOM

20:42.344 --> 20:47.275
OF THE GLASS AND ROLL IT UP
USING MY UP TO THE TOOTHPICK AT

20:47.309 --> 20:48.448
THE END OF THE GLASS.

20:48.481 --> 20:57.689
NOW I HATE OLIVES AND I'M NOT A
FAN OF MAR MARTINIS.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.205
>> THIS COMPETITION IS TRICKY.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.034
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TINY, TINY
MOVE.

21:03.067 --> 21:04.172
AND I'M A BIG PERSON.

21:04.205 --> 21:07.136
I DON'T MAKE TINY MOVEMENTS.

21:07.172 --> 21:10.689
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE BRING IN A
DESIGNATED DRIVER FOR THIS.

21:10.723 --> 21:12.205
>> LOOK AT CLAIRE.

21:12.240 --> 21:17.034
>> LET'S GO CLAIRE.

21:17.067 --> 21:21.792
>> Z THAT'S ALL RIGHT, CLAIRE.

21:21.826 --> 21:24.826
>> OH MY GOD.

21:24.862 --> 21:31.172
>> MY STRATEGY FOR THIS IS SLOW
AND STEADY WINS THE RACE.

21:31.205 --> 21:35.689
I WANT TO TAKE MY TIME,
BALANCING THESE THINGS BECAUSE I

21:35.723 --> 21:38.862
WOULD RATHER HAVE LESS BALLS
TROP THAN MORE.

21:38.895 --> 21:40.931
>> SHE IS TAKING HER TIME WHICH
IS GOOD.

21:40.964 --> 21:44.275
>> SHE'S NOT GETTING ANYWHERE
THOUGH.

21:44.309 --> 21:46.654
>> AND AZAH IS FOCUSED.

21:46.689 --> 21:49.758
>> YES, AZAH IS LASER FOCUSED.

21:49.792 --> 21:50.723
>> SHE'S LIKE GLAIM FACE.

21:50.758 --> 21:53.205
>> SHE IS ABOUT TO MOVE THAT
WITH HER BRAIN.

21:53.240 --> 21:59.309
>> SO I DEFINITELY THINK I GOT
THE SLOW AND STEADY PART RIGHT

21:59.344 --> 22:03.792
BUT MY BALL IS MOVING A LOT
SLOWER THAN OTHERS.

22:03.826 --> 22:06.689
>> SHE IS TAKING HER TIME, IT'S
SMART.

22:06.723 --> 22:15.344
>> THAT IS THE GOAL OH, SORRY
ABOUT THE LIGHT.

22:15.378 --> 22:18.136
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN LIGHTS GO OUT
AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.758
I DO NOT DRINK VERY OFTEN
BECAUSE I'M SUCH A LIGHTWEIGHT

22:21.792 --> 22:26.689
BUT I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BLACK OUT AFTER

22:26.723 --> 22:35.862
DRINKING, NOT DURING.

22:35.895 --> 22:38.000
>> OH, LOOK AT THAT.

22:38.034 --> 22:41.931
>> THIS COMPETITION LOOKS LIKE
IT IS ALL ABOUT SPEED BUT REALLY

22:41.964 --> 22:45.413
IT'S OLIVE ABOUT PRECISE
MOVEMENTS.

22:45.448 --> 22:49.034
AS AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
ENGINEER I'M USED TO USING MATH

22:49.067 --> 22:50.964
TO SOLVE VERY COMPLEX PROBLEMS.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.964
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE
PERFECT VELOCITY, ACCELERATION,

22:56.000 --> 23:01.240
MOMENTUM, FRICTION TO GET OT
LIVES DOWN MY MARTINI GLASS AND

23:01.275 --> 23:06.034
ON TO THE TOOTHPICK.

23:06.067 --> 23:10.689
>> OH, COME ON.

23:10.723 --> 23:14.378
>> I KEEP GETTING THE OLIVE ALL
THE WAY PAST THE FIRST BEND AND

23:14.413 --> 23:17.344
IT FALLS OFF EVERY TIME.

23:17.378 --> 23:20.826
I'M GETTING INCREASINGLY
FRUSTRATED ESPECIALLY AS I LOOK

23:20.862 --> 23:27.826
OVER AND I CAN SEE CLAIRE IS
GETTING IT FURTHER AND FURTHER

23:27.862 --> 23:30.689
EVERY TIME.

23:30.723 --> 23:37.413
>> CRAZY.

23:37.448 --> 23:41.517
>> OH I'M GETTING MY OLIVE TO
THE END OF THE RIM BUT I SHOW

23:41.550 --> 23:46.413
LOSE THE MOMENTUM AND THE OLIVE
GOES POOF, I NEED TO CALM DOWN.

23:46.448 --> 23:56.481
I JUST WANT TO WIN THIS COMP SO
BAD.

23:56.481 --> 24:07.172
I JUST WANT TO WIN THIS COMP SO
BAD.

24:07.205 --> 24:08.413
>> OH.

24:08.448 --> 24:12.034
I NEED TO BUCKLE DOWN AND GET
THIS OLIVE INTO THE TOOTHPICK

24:12.067 --> 24:14.275
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO BE SAFE
THIS WEEK.

24:14.309 --> 24:24.826
AND I WANT TO SHOW TO EVERYBODY
THAT I AM A COMPETITOR.

24:24.862 --> 24:32.378
>> I AM GETTING SO CLOSE TO
GETTING MY O LIVE ON THE

24:32.413 --> 24:33.654
TOOTHPICK T IS SO FRUSTRATING.

24:33.689 --> 24:38.413
IF AZAH OR WHITNEY BEAT ME AT
THIS ONE, OH MY GOSH, I'M GOING

24:38.448 --> 24:46.654
TO BE LIVID!

24:46.689 --> 24:50.723
>>
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

24:50.758 --> 24:56.000
>> NO
.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.826
>> NO
.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.413
>> CONGRATULATIONS, CLAIRE, YOU
HAVE WON THE WILDCARD

25:22.448 --> 25:22.931
COMPETITION.

25:22.964 --> 25:25.136
>> THAT WAS SO HARD.

25:25.172 --> 25:27.413
>> YES, YES, YES, YES.

25:27.448 --> 25:32.792
>> I AM THRILLED TO FINALLY WIN
A COMPETITION.

25:32.826 --> 25:34.378
I'M SO EXCITED.

25:34.413 --> 25:37.619
IT FEELS SO GOOD TO HAVE WON
SAFETY THIS WEEK.

25:37.654 --> 25:41.723
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS
WILDCARD DECISION IS GOING TO BE

25:41.758 --> 25:44.550
AND I'M KIND OF NERVOUS.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.067
>> I'M A LITTLE BIT
DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT DOES

25:47.103 --> 25:50.689
KIND OF SUCK NOT TO HAVE SAFETY
THIS WEEK FOR ME AND MY TEAM.

25:50.723 --> 25:55.586
>> HOPEFULLY THE JOKERS WON'T BE
USED AS A PAWN AGAIN.

25:55.619 --> 25:59.862
>> I AM RIDICULOUSLY BUMMED
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I SO BADLY

25:59.895 --> 26:01.034
WANTED TO WIN THIS.

26:01.067 --> 26:07.826
NOW I JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT
THIS WILDCARD DECISION DOES

26:07.862 --> 26:08.550
NOT.

26:08.586 --> 26:09.448
>> I WANT AN ACTUAL MARTINI NOW.

26:09.481 --> 26:13.689
I FEEL LIKE I NEED A DRINK.

26:13.723 --> 26:14.689
>> CONGRATULATIONS, CLAIRE!

26:14.723 --> 26:22.689
YOU HAVE WON THIS WEEK'S
WILDCARD COMPETITION.

26:22.723 --> 26:23.517
>> WHOOO!

26:23.550 --> 26:25.586
>> YOUR WILDCARD DECISION IS
SIMPLE.

26:25.619 --> 26:32.619
EITHER CHOOSE SEAFORT FOR YOU
AND YOUR ENTIRE TEAM FOR ONE

26:32.654 --> 26:37.378
WEEK MEANING NO ONE FROM YOUR
TEAM CAN BE EVICTED THIS WEEK.

26:37.413 --> 26:46.689
OR CHOOSE TO KEEP YOURSELF AND
ONLY YOURSELF SAFE.

26:46.723 --> 26:49.205
UNTIL THE JURY.

26:49.240 --> 26:53.275
THAT'S RIGHT, CHOOSING SAFETY
FOR ONLY YOURSELF WILL GUARANTEE

26:53.309 --> 26:57.826
YOUR SPOT ON THIS SEASON'S JURY.

26:57.862 --> 26:58.862
>> WOW.

26:58.895 --> 27:06.136
>> YOU HAVE A FEW MOMENTS TO
MAKE YOUR DECISION.

27:06.172 --> 27:07.413
>> DAMN, THAT'S BIG.

27:07.448 --> 27:09.895
>> THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS HERE,
RIGHT, I CAN BE A TEAM PLAYER AN

27:09.931 --> 27:13.758
GET SAFETY FOR MY TEAM AND THEY
WILL BE SUPERHAPPY THIS WEEK.

27:13.792 --> 27:20.413
OR I CAN LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF AND
TAKE THIS INDIVIDUAL SAFETY

27:20.448 --> 27:21.275
UNTIL JURY.

27:21.309 --> 27:22.931
I'M REALLY GOING BACK AND FORTH
HERE.

27:22.964 --> 27:25.172
THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH DECISION
TO MAKE.

27:35.034 --> 27:41.034
EITHER CHOOSE SAFETY FOR YOU AND
YOUR ENTIRE TEAM FOR ONE WEEK OR

27:41.067 --> 27:50.205
CHOOSE TO KEEP YOURSELF AND ONLY
YOURSELF SAFE UNTIL JURY.

27:50.240 --> 27:53.689
>> AS A WINNER OF THE WILDCARD
CLAIRE CAN KEEP ME, TIFFANY AND

27:53.723 --> 27:56.792
HERSELF SAFE FOR THE WEEK OR SHE
CAN JUST KEEP HERSELF SAFE ALL

27:56.826 --> 27:59.000
THE WAY UNTIL JURY.

27:59.034 --> 28:02.826
>> THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY.

28:02.862 --> 28:12.136
>> I ABSOLUTELY ADORE MY QUEENS
SO, SO MUCH.

28:12.172 --> 28:20.895
I-- I'M GOING TO TAKE SAFETY FOR
JUST MYSELF.

28:20.931 --> 28:24.619
>> I'M A HUGE BB FAN, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

28:24.654 --> 28:29.034
INDIVIDUAL SAFETY UNTIL JURY, I
HAVE TO GO FOR THAT, OF COURSE.

28:29.067 --> 28:33.240
SORRY QUEENS, LIKE LOVE YA BUT
LATER LOSERS.

28:33.275 --> 28:35.034
>> I'M SORRY.

28:35.067 --> 28:40.378
>> NO, NO, NO.

28:40.413 --> 28:50.448
>> NOBODY THINK ABOUT JUMPING IN
HERE

28:50.448 --> 29:01.964
>> NOBODY THINK ABOUT JUMPING IN
HERE

29:02.000 --> 29:04.034
UNTIL JURY.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.034
>> IT TWORKED OUT.

29:05.067 --> 29:05.895
>> IT WORKED OUT.

29:05.931 --> 29:09.205
>> I AM SO HAPPY FOR HER.

29:09.240 --> 29:13.034
I WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HER
LIKE ARE YOU CRAZY, GIRL, IF SHE

29:13.067 --> 29:18.550
WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP HER SAFETY
FOR ONE WEEK OF SAFETY FOR KY

29:18.586 --> 29:28.619
AND MYSELF, EVEN IF IT DOES
JEOPARDIZE OUR GAME.

29:28.619 --> 29:33.550
AND MYSELF, EVEN IF IT DOES
JEOPARDIZE OUR GAME.

29:33.586 --> 29:34.067
HEY JURY.

29:34.103 --> 29:39.758
>> HEY JURY MEMBERS.

29:39.792 --> 29:45.136
>> I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR
SOMEONE TO WIN 750,000.

29:45.172 --> 29:47.067
>> CLAIRE FIRST OF ALL
CONGRATULATIONS.

29:47.103 --> 29:48.240
>> THANK YOU.

29:48.275 --> 29:51.895
>> I MEAN ANYONE WOULD HAVE
PICKED THAT, THAT IS CRAZY.

29:51.931 --> 29:54.792
POTENTIAL PROTECTS YOU TWO OR
THREE WEEKS.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.826
>> ULTIMATELY MY GAME IS WITH
THE ROYAL FLUSH.

29:57.862 --> 30:01.654
I NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS
ON THE SAME PAGE BEFORE

30:01.689 --> 30:08.619
NOMINATING SOMEONE THAT
POTENTIALLY-- THE ROYAL FLUSH.

30:08.654 --> 30:12.689
>> WHO IS NOMINATED-- I FEAL
LIKE WHITNEY MAKES SENSE.

30:12.723 --> 30:18.103
WHITNEY AND HANNAH MAKE A LOT OF
SENSE WHITNEY AND THE JOKER

30:18.136 --> 30:21.689
COULD MAKE SENSE.

30:21.723 --> 30:26.826
>> I FEEL THAT WHITNEY WOULD
ABSOLUTELY PUT ME UP.

30:26.862 --> 30:31.792
NO ONE ELSE-- MY TARGET WOULD BE
WHITNEY.

30:31.826 --> 30:34.309
>> BUT WE SHOULD GET RID OF WHO
IS NOT WORKING WITH US BUT WE

30:34.344 --> 30:39.309
THINK IS THE MOST LIKELY TO WIN
THE COMP NEXT WEEK, NOT WHITNEY,

30:39.344 --> 30:44.344
CLEARLY, WE HAVE SEEN HER IN TWO
COMPS AND SHE SUCKS.

30:44.378 --> 30:46.275
AND HER SOCIAL GAME IS ALSO BAD.

30:46.309 --> 30:52.309
I THINK THE TARGET SHOULD BE
HANNAH.

30:52.344 --> 30:58.034
>> HANNAH IS OVERALL A MUCH
BIGGER THREAT TO MY GAME, SHE'S

30:58.067 --> 31:00.448
SMART, SHE'S LATH ATHLETIC.

31:00.481 --> 31:03.275
SHE HAS ALL OF THESE GUYS
WRAPPED AROUND HER FINGER.

31:03.309 --> 31:05.792
I'M FRUSTRATED THE OTHER PEOPLE
IN MY ALLIANCE DON'T SEE HANNAH

31:05.826 --> 31:06.862
AS THE TARGET SHE.

31:06.895 --> 31:08.034
IS HUGE RED FLAG.

31:08.067 --> 31:11.550
>> I THINK THAT THERE IS
SOMEBODY ELSE THAT IS MORE OF A

31:11.586 --> 31:16.931
THREAT TO BOTH OF OUR TEAMS AND
THAT IS BRITINI.

31:16.964 --> 31:21.136
BRITINI HAS A LEGITIMATE REASON
TO TARGET BOTH OF OUR TEAMS.

31:21.172 --> 31:28.550
SHE COULD WIN NEXT WEEK AND PUT
GUYS ON THE BLOCK AND I KNOW

31:28.586 --> 31:31.586
EVERYBODY FEELS BAD THAT SHE WAS
ON THE BLOCK TWICE IN A ROW.

31:31.619 --> 31:38.309
BUT IF I WON NEXT WEEK I'M
LOOKING AT BRIT INI.

31:38.344 --> 31:41.000
>> HANNAH, WE ALL AGREE SHE IS A
SMART PLAYER, RIGHT.

31:41.034 --> 31:42.205
>> YES.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.758
>> AND SHE PUTS TWO OF US UP,
SHE KNOWS WE'RE COMING AFTER

31:44.792 --> 31:48.172
HER, I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
BENEFITS ANYBODY TO PUT TWO OF

31:48.205 --> 31:50.034
US UP BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE
COMING AFTER.

31:50.067 --> 31:52.931
>> I HAVE TO KEEP HANNAH SAFE
BUT NOT SHOW MY CARDS AT THE

31:52.964 --> 31:54.240
SAME TIME.

31:54.275 --> 31:59.034
UNDER NO SIRKS CAN THERE BE ANY
WHIFF OF AN IDEA THAT MEMBERS OF

31:59.067 --> 32:00.517
THE COOKOUT ARE WORKING
TOGETHER.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.895
>> I GET THAT YOU GUYS ARE
THINKING ABOUT SWRIR AND

32:02.931 --> 32:05.826
THINKING ABOUT VOTES BUT I'M
STILL THINKING ABOUT MAKING IT

32:05.862 --> 32:07.067
THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

32:07.103 --> 32:11.309
OUT OF ALL OF US, HANNAH WOULD
PUT ME UP BEFORE ANY OF Y'ALL.

32:11.344 --> 32:12.586
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT ONE WEEK.

32:12.619 --> 32:15.792
SHE HADN'T RALLY OUR SUPPORT,
LIKE HEY, WE GOT PLAN A, WE WILL

32:15.826 --> 32:19.309
TAKE HER TO THE END WITH US, WE
HAVE SUPPORT THIS WEEK BECAUSE

32:19.344 --> 32:20.481
OF A DIFFERENT TARGET.

32:20.517 --> 32:23.034
>> SHE IS CLOSE TO SEVERAL
MEMBERS OF OUR ALLIANCE AND AS

32:23.067 --> 32:27.034
ONE NOT CLOSE TO HER THAT
IS-- SEEING YOU GUYS FIGHT FOR

32:27.067 --> 32:30.205
HER, SHE HAS MANAGED TO CONVINCE
YOU THAT THEY IS NOT GOING TO GO

32:30.240 --> 32:33.136
AGAINST YOU, SHE IS NOT A
THREAT, YOU CAN GET HER UNDER

32:33.172 --> 32:34.413
WHY YOU ARE WING.

32:34.448 --> 32:36.481
>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR AND SAY
I'M NOT NECESSARILY FIGHTING FOR

32:36.517 --> 32:41.136
HANNAH, WHAT I HAVE SAID IS WHO
MY TARGET WOULD BE WHICH WAS THE

32:41.172 --> 32:42.240
QUESTION.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.550
>> I DON'T THINK WE REALLY WANT
HANNAH ON THE BLOCK.

32:43.586 --> 32:49.136
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MEMBERS
OF THE COOKOUT ON THE BLOCK THIS

32:49.172 --> 32:50.309
WEEK.

32:50.344 --> 32:54.723
BUT HOPEFULLY THE TARGET STAYS
ON WHITNEY AND BRITINI.

32:54.758 --> 32:59.034
>> I JUST FEEL FOR OUR GAME AS A
WHOLE, I DON'T KNOW WHY NO ONE

32:59.067 --> 33:04.862
IS LOOKING AT SOMEBODY WHO CAN
TARGET BOTH OF OUR TEAMS.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.826
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL.

33:07.862 --> 33:12.550
>> YEAH, THOSE ARE THE THREE
PEOPLE THAT I HAVE THOUGHT

33:12.586 --> 33:13.826
ABOUT.

33:13.862 --> 33:15.862
>> I WISH YOU THE BEST IN YOUR
DECISION, GO WITH YOUR GUT, THIS

33:15.895 --> 33:18.103
IS YOUR H.O.H.

33:18.136 --> 33:22.758
>> ULTIMATELY IT IS YOUR
DECISION TO MAKE.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.619
>> SEND HOME ANYONE THAT IS NOT
IN THE FLUSH.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.448
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I SUPPORT

33:40.172 --> 33:42.448
>> HELLO JOKERS, HERE WE ARE
AGAIN.

33:42.481 --> 33:48.448
>> I'M SLIGHTLY CONFLICTED ON
WHO TO FOCUS ON AS A TARGET.

33:48.481 --> 33:52.826
SO I NEEDED TO MEET WITH THE
JOKERS TO SEE WHERE EVERYONE

33:52.862 --> 33:56.792
HAD, ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES AND
OPINIONS ON WHO I SHOULD PUT UP

33:56.826 --> 33:58.136
THIS WEEK.

33:58.172 --> 34:04.344
>> I WANT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT NEXT WEEK YOU GUYS WOULD

34:04.378 --> 34:05.619
HAVE ALL OF THAT.

34:05.654 --> 34:10.034
>> THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAS LIED
TO EACH OTHER TO GET THEIR OWN

34:10.068 --> 34:11.619
PLAYER OUT.

34:11.655 --> 34:13.931
SO THEY'RE NOT VERY TRUST WORTHY
ALREADY.

34:13.965 --> 34:19.965
IT SEEMS LIKE BEFORE BRENT WENT
ON AS SPOKESMAN FOR THE ACES, DO

34:20.000 --> 34:23.034
YOU THINK SOMEONE ELSE-- Z.

34:23.068 --> 34:27.793
>> I THINK SOMEONE ELSE IS
ALWAYS GOING TO KNOW SHE IS

34:27.827 --> 34:29.172
ALONGSIDE BRENT AND I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE WS.

34:29.206 --> 34:32.172
>> YOU ARE STUPID IF YOU THINK
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO PUT TWO

34:32.206 --> 34:33.344
PEOPLE FROM THE ACES.

34:33.378 --> 34:35.793
>> YOU HAVE LITERALLY NO IDEA
WHERE THEIR LOYALTY LIES.

34:35.827 --> 34:39.619
>> KIND OF RIGHT IN FRONT OF
YOUR FACE T IS LITERALLY WALKING

34:39.655 --> 34:42.965
WITH BLOND EXTENSIONS WALKING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.413
>> WHITNEY IS ALWAYS ONE TO
TALK, ALWAYS THE ONE PLANNING,

34:45.447 --> 34:49.862
THE ONE HAVING CONVERSATIONS
WITH EVERYBODY, LIKE SHE

34:49.896 --> 34:54.655
LITERALLY SAID IF THEY LOSE, WE
SHOULD ALL GO FOR THE KINGS, AS

34:54.688 --> 34:55.481
SHE SAID TODAY.

34:55.516 --> 34:57.000
>> SHE WAS DEFINITELY COMING FOR
YOU.

34:57.034 --> 34:59.275
>> I'M JUST GOING TO TELL THEM
THAT WHITNEY WAS GOING TO PUT

34:59.309 --> 35:01.000
THEM UP ON THE BLOCK.

35:01.034 --> 35:04.619
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER I NEED
TO DO TO KEEP THE TARGET OFF ME

35:04.655 --> 35:07.034
AND MY TEAMMATES.

35:07.068 --> 35:11.103
>> MY TARGET WAS W, I DON'T LIKE
NAMES BUT YES.

35:11.137 --> 35:15.931
>> THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO
MAKE THE MOVE TO SEND YOURSELF

35:15.965 --> 35:19.309
FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

35:19.344 --> 35:20.862
>> .

35:20.896 --> 35:22.275
>> THANK YOU.

35:22.309 --> 35:23.516
>> THANK YOU.

35:23.550 --> 35:26.655
>> I'M HOPING CHRISTIAN WILL
HAVE HIS SIGHTS SET ON WHITNEY,

35:26.688 --> 35:31.862
AS COOKOUT MEMBERS WE ALWAYS
DISSWAYED AND PUT DOWN ANY TALK

35:31.896 --> 35:36.827
OR CONVERSATION AROUND ANY
OTHERS AND TRY TO SQUASH THAT

35:36.862 --> 35:38.000
IMMEDIATELY.

35:38.034 --> 35:39.896
>> I WANT THE TARGET TO BE
HANNAH.

35:39.931 --> 35:44.827
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE NEXT WEEK
THEY'RE GOING AFTER WHITNEY.

35:44.862 --> 35:49.585
>> CLEARLY THE QUEENS DON'T WANT
HER OUT AND THE JOKERS WANT HER

35:49.619 --> 35:50.516
OUT.

35:50.550 --> 35:53.103
>> THE QUEENS AND JOKERS WANT
WHITNEY OUT.

35:53.137 --> 35:55.447
>> SO WHY ARE WE DOING THE JOKE
THAT THEY WANT TO.

35:55.481 --> 35:58.309
>> I HATE THAT MY TEAM IS SMART
IT MAKES IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT

35:58.344 --> 36:02.068
FOR ME TO PROTECT THE COOKOUT.

36:02.103 --> 36:08.172
>> NO ONE IS GOING AFTER HANNAH.

36:08.206 --> 36:16.034
>> I'M NOT THINK BEING MY REIGN,
I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN I DON'T

36:16.068 --> 36:23.931
HAVE THE POWER.

36:23.965 --> 36:25.206
HOW ARE YOU.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.309
>> AT THIS POINT I REALLY WANT
HANNAH TO TRUST ME GOING FORWARD

36:27.344 --> 36:29.931
WHICH ASK ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IF
THE NOMINATE, SO THE BEST WAY IS

36:29.965 --> 36:34.172
TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE SOURCE,
BRING HANNAH IN THE ROOM, HAVE A

36:34.206 --> 36:38.309
ONE-ON-ONE WITH HER AND DISCUSS
THE POTENTIAL OF HER GOING UP AS

36:38.344 --> 36:44.516
A PAWN AND SEE HOW SHE FEELS
ABOUT IT.

36:44.550 --> 36:52.688
>> IT SEESMS LIKE THE HOUSE IS
COMING AFTER WHITNEY.

36:52.724 --> 36:53.793
>> YEAH.

36:53.827 --> 36:59.275
>> AND I CAN'T PUT UP DEREK
BECAUSE-- I DON'T KNOW.

36:59.309 --> 37:04.137
I THINK WE HAVE TO GO H I DON'T
WANT TO RUIN IT BUT-- YOU STAY

37:04.172 --> 37:05.793
OVER WHITNEY.

37:05.827 --> 37:11.344
>> ARE YOU SAYING I'M GOING UP
AS A HAHN, JUST BE HONEST.

37:11.378 --> 37:12.619
>>.

37:12.655 --> 37:14.000
>> CHRISTIAN KIND OF HINTS THAT
I COULD BE PUT UP ON THE BLOCK

37:14.034 --> 37:17.655
AS A PAWN.

37:17.688 --> 37:22.137
MY WHEELS ARE TURNING AND
TRNING, WHAT CAN I SAY TO

37:22.172 --> 37:24.896
CONVINCE CHRISTIAN TO NOT PUT ME
ON THE BLOCK AS A PAWN?

37:24.931 --> 37:31.516
THIS IS A DO OR DIE CONVERSATION
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

37:31.550 --> 37:39.585
>> ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I
WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.

37:39.619 --> 37:42.862

SPINNING.

41:04.481 --> 41:08.965
