00:05.222 --> 00:09.661
- For ages, the Black man
has been seen as many things.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.795
As sketchy, as wild,

00:12.838 --> 00:15.841
as arrogant and insensitive,

00:15.885 --> 00:19.019
but I'm going to let you in
on a little secret

00:19.062 --> 00:20.281
about Black men.

00:20.324 --> 00:23.327
We have a softer,
more sensitive side.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.938
That's right. We love.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.897
The flowers are for his mom.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.160
And it ain't even Mother's Day.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.510
We laugh. Trust me.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.513
That dude is a joy
to be around.

00:35.557 --> 00:39.343
We care.
This guy cares about animals.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.519
That's a bean burrito,
for your information.

00:41.563 --> 00:44.174
And believe it or not, we cry.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.959
My man gets sad sometimes,
and that's okay.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.352
What I'm saying is...

00:50.180 --> 00:53.183
Our multitudes got multitudes.

00:53.227 --> 00:56.099
It feels so good
to get this off my chest.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.842
Thank you for letting me share.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.803
<i>Let's explore all of this
a bit more, shall we?</i>

01:09.504 --> 01:12.072
- Hey, here you go, guys.
Hey, baby.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.117
- Hey.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.466
- Okay.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.821
- Damn, homey, I know I said
don't bang where we hang,

01:22.865 --> 01:24.214
but you got her
slobbing on the job,

01:24.258 --> 01:25.781
so it must be going well.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.739
- How long's it been now?
- Four months.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.524
The thing about her is,
I've never been in love

01:29.567 --> 01:31.352
with someone more
in my entire life.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.701
- What?
- Full stop.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.616
- Bro, you out here
looking like a trampoline.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.792
Extra sprung.
Boing, boing.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.447
- Oh, he's been like this
ever since we were kids.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.275
In elementary school,
every Halloween,

01:41.318 --> 01:43.146
he would dress up
as a loving husband.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.756
- What?
- What is that costume?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.410
- Okay, shut it down
for a second, okay?

01:46.454 --> 01:48.108
Because you guys are making it
sound like I'm a sap,

01:48.151 --> 01:49.587
and I'm definitely not, okay?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.372
Lest we forget, I used to be
out on these date streets

01:51.415 --> 01:53.025
running hella game, okay?

01:53.069 --> 01:54.592
Dates on dates on dates
on dates on dates on dates.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.769
It's just with Alicia,
you know, she's--she's special.

01:57.813 --> 01:58.857
- Oh, come on, man,

01:58.901 --> 02:00.120
every other girl
you meet is special

02:00.163 --> 02:01.338
or one of a kind
or had you at hello.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.687
But I know
what's really going on.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.820
The sex is bomb.
She must be breaking that back.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.605
- For the last time,
can we please not talk

02:07.649 --> 02:09.390
about me having bomb sex
in front of my sister?

02:09.433 --> 02:11.392
- For the last time,
yes, we can.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.221
My sexuality has always been
key to this group.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.919
For example,
I have a Tinder date later,

02:16.962 --> 02:20.140
and I'm hoping it ends with
our crotches getting steamy.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.402
- Oh, thanks, Nicky.
That reminds me.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.143
I'm throwing
an anniversary party next week,

02:23.186 --> 02:24.231
and I expect all y'all
to be there.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.406
- What did Nicky just say

02:25.449 --> 02:26.755
that reminded
you of your anniversary?

02:26.798 --> 02:28.496
- On our honeymoon,
Kristen and I were having

02:28.539 --> 02:31.499
breakfast in bed, and I spilled
mint tea on my crotch.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.978
Steamy crotch.
- That makes sense.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.633
- Oh, yeah, it does.
- So speaking of anniversaries,

02:35.677 --> 02:38.680
feels like now's as good a time
to tell you guys as any.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.597
I'm gonna ask Alicia
to marry me.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.555
What?
- Why would you do that?

02:44.599 --> 02:45.991
- Wait, what's--
what's with the mumbles?

02:47.471 --> 02:48.646
- Seriously, dude, I've had
almond milk in my fridge

02:48.690 --> 02:49.995
longer than you've been
with Alicia.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.432
So maybe you're rushing.

02:51.475 --> 02:52.824
- Or maybe you should drink
your almond milk faster.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.174
- No, man. He's right.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.698
No Black man should get married
before age 75.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.482
You still look the same
and you get more time

02:58.526 --> 02:59.744
to sow your royal oats.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.224
Give me some.
- "Royal oats"?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.487
This isn't "Coming to America,"
and even if it was,

03:03.531 --> 03:05.402
Prince Akeem chose love
over the single life.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.708
Nah, I'm all for it.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.623
I love my queen,
and I'm excited

03:08.666 --> 03:11.191
that you gon' lock it down
with yours, Noah.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.368
Noah.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.457
- As I said before,
boing, boing.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.850
-
What y'all say?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.941
Whoo!

03:22.985 --> 03:24.334
- That sex.
- Mm.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.727
- Wow, that was
a great game out there.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.642
I mean, you really
left it all out on the court.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.470
- I know.
You--you were on fire.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.167
Hitting buckets from deep.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.564
-
- Whoo!

03:38.435 --> 03:44.876
<i>â™ª</i>

03:53.711 --> 03:54.712
- Sup?

03:54.756 --> 03:56.366
- Sup, king?

03:56.410 --> 03:58.368
- Chilling, man. How you doing?

03:58.412 --> 03:59.978
- Good, good, good.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.545
Yo, man, have you
been using my Netflix?

04:01.589 --> 04:03.068
- Oh, yeah, homey,
I've been watching

04:03.112 --> 04:04.896
this Japanese reality show
called "Ainori Love Wagon."

04:04.940 --> 04:05.941
Everyone is so polite,

04:05.984 --> 04:07.290
but there's still
palpable tension.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.770
That joint goes hard.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.598
- That's great, but now
my algorithm's all confused.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.687
All my shows are Japanese.
- You're welcome.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.080
Or should I say--

04:15.124 --> 04:17.387
- "Million Yen Women."
- Oh, that joint goes hard.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.910
- "Samurai Gourmet."
- That joint goes so hard.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.825
- "Devilman Crybaby."
- That joint goes the hardest.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.523
- "
The Sweet Tooth Salaryman"?

04:22.566 --> 04:25.265
- Ah, correction.
That joint goes the hardest.

04:25.308 --> 04:28.268
- Okay, cool.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.095
So it would be great

04:30.139 --> 04:32.315
if you could get
your own account at some point.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.622
- Oh, yeah. I know, right?
- Yeah, right.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.668
Also, have you seen
my kombucha?

04:37.712 --> 04:39.104
- Oh, definitely.
I drank those.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.323
- The whole case?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.020
- Oh, yeah, bro.
I was doing some research.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.892
Turns out kombucha has
hella benefits

04:43.935 --> 04:45.415
like reducing your risk of
cancer,

04:45.459 --> 04:46.590
promoting mental health.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.288
It's like a liquid shield.
Who knew?

04:48.331 --> 04:49.593
- Can you buy me
another pack, please?

04:49.637 --> 04:51.029
- Oh, for sure, my guy.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.857
Just as soon as I finishing
pumping this iron.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.646
<i>- And then Vin Diesel said,
"Nicky, we're family now."</i>

04:58.689 --> 05:01.779
- Wow.
Now that was an amazing story.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.608
- Thank you.
- This is so nice.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.957
Just being on a date

05:06.001 --> 05:08.656
with a funny, intelligent
Black woman.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.006
- Well, I guess the Lord
hath blessed ya.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.269
So tell me more about your job.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.358
- Yeah,
I-I work at a hedge fund.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.055
It definitely has
its ups and downs.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.230
- Mm-hmm.
- But hey,

05:18.274 --> 05:20.145
at least
the economy's recovered, right?

05:20.189 --> 05:21.756
Thanks, Obama.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.289
- Ah! Intruder! Intruder!
- No, no, no, no.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.988
Oh, I can't see!
- You picked the wrong one.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.468
Get ready to die.
I'll cut you deep.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.948
- It's Noah. It's Noah.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.036
- Noah?
- Yes!

05:41.079 --> 05:42.472
Boyfriend Noah.
Please don't stab.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.952
- You scared the crap
out of me.

05:43.995 --> 05:46.520
What's with this
measuring tape?

05:46.563 --> 05:48.826
- Oh, snap, was I--
was I sleep measuring again?

05:48.870 --> 05:51.481
- Hm?
- Right. Sorry.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.266
I was just trying to measure
your ring finger

05:54.310 --> 05:57.008
to propose marriage.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.619
I love you, Alicia.

05:58.662 --> 06:02.057
And I--I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.408
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.106
So what do you think?

06:10.065 --> 06:13.198
- No.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.983
- Uh...

06:17.551 --> 06:19.683
- Okay, so my date
with Davis went really well.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.598
He's got a sexy mind and body

06:21.642 --> 06:23.426
and smells like fresh lavender.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.995
But at one point in the night,
he did say,

06:27.038 --> 06:28.300
"Thanks, Obama."

06:28.344 --> 06:30.346
- Wait, how'd he say it?
Like, "Thanks, Obama!"

06:30.390 --> 06:33.218
- It was sarcastic.
Like, "Thanks, Obama."

06:33.262 --> 06:35.482
Made me wonder if he was,
like, a Black Republican.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.832
But they're not out here in
the streets like that, right?

06:37.875 --> 06:39.268
- So what are you gonna do?

06:39.311 --> 06:41.357
- I suppose the only way
to figure out what he meant

06:41.401 --> 06:44.665
is to see him again
and have sex with him.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.841
Ow! Thanks, Obama.

06:46.884 --> 06:50.322
- Yo, this new bar is dope.
Hey, how's that tequila neat?

06:50.366 --> 06:52.063
Looks like they did a good job.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.674
- It's a tequila neat,
so I guess they did

06:53.717 --> 06:55.502
a pretty good job
pouring tequila in a glass.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.852
- Hold up, I sense darkness
in your brightness.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.201
What's going on?

06:59.244 --> 07:00.550
And why aren't we
at Dolly Pitchers?

07:00.594 --> 07:04.249
- Oh, right.
Well, Alicia and I broke up.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.860
She figured out
I was gonna propose

07:05.903 --> 07:07.252
and said that she needed
some space,

07:07.296 --> 07:09.037
and I was like, "Done."

07:09.080 --> 07:10.255
- Whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.083
So we can't go
to Dolly Pitchers anymore?

07:12.127 --> 07:13.563
Damn!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.695
Let's not make him feel bad.

07:14.738 --> 07:15.913
He just had his heart broken.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.132
- Man, I just had
my heart broken too.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.047
Dolly Pitchers gave out
free hot dogs

07:19.090 --> 07:20.178
on Wednesday nights.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.745
I just lost Weenie Wednesdays.

07:21.789 --> 07:25.009
- Weenie Wednesdays is
the least of our worries.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.837
Breakup Noah is back.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.926
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.538
I knew you guys were gonna
bring up how I have reacted--

07:31.581 --> 07:34.410
Overreacted.
- In the past to breakups.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.412
But that was the old me, okay?
I can handle myself now.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.718
- Man, please.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.241
You gon' wallow,
and then you gonna beg for her

07:39.284 --> 07:41.591
to take you back with your
last-scene-in-a-rom-com ass.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.072
- Admit it.
You're soft like baby butt.

07:44.115 --> 07:47.292
- No.
I'm--I'm hard like muscle butt.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.164
Look, okay, I am totally fine,
all right?

07:49.207 --> 07:50.513
I promise you, I'm moving on.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.993
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, right.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.516
- Guys, I am for real.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.996
I'm good,
and we just found ourselves

07:55.039 --> 07:57.259
a new go-to bar,
so I'm extra good.

07:58.608 --> 07:59.609
- Wait, what's happening?

07:59.653 --> 08:01.219
- Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.483
This only happens
every 20 minutes or so.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.049
- We should keep searching
for a new bar, yeah?

08:05.093 --> 08:06.355
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.621
<i>â™ª</i>

08:11.665 --> 08:12.927
- Sup.
- Sup.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.319
- Man, I'm trying
to take a little nap

08:14.363 --> 08:15.364
and that's a little loud.
You think you could get

08:15.407 --> 08:16.496
a couple decibels
off that joint?

08:16.539 --> 08:18.019
- Damn, my bad.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.411
It's just the music really
helps me lock into my work.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.326
Any chance I could leave it?
- Uh, yeah.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.285
Yeah, all right, cool.
Yeah, no problem.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.547
- Oh, hey, by the way,

08:24.591 --> 08:26.288
I got new toilet paper
since it was my turn.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.769
I just got the single ply.
It was on sale.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.511
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.036
But you know I like the TP
with the thickness, right?

08:35.079 --> 08:36.559
Preferably the brand

08:36.603 --> 08:38.082
where the bears are taking
a dump in the woods.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.344
- Yeah but it's kinda
all the same to me

08:39.388 --> 08:40.302
and I didn't think
you'd mind saving money

08:40.345 --> 08:41.521
since you don't have a job-job.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.913
- Oh.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.393
You know,
that's an interesting point.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.699
I hadn't thought about it
in the way you just put it.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.136
Thank you for your
consideration in this matter.

08:48.179 --> 08:52.575
- For sure.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.489
Sup?
- Sup.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.143
- Nothing, you?
- Nothing.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.448
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.059
- Yeah, enjoy that nap.
- Thank you.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.756
I'ma get my Z's on.
- Do that.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.497
- All right.
- All right.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.846
<i>- Now a look at the weather
with Danielle.</i>

09:06.371 --> 09:07.938

09:07.982 --> 09:09.157
How you doing?
How you holding up?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.462

I was like,

Shout-out Taylor Swift.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.383
- Noah, those are
the white people

09:18.427 --> 09:19.602
that you listen to
when you are saddest.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.647
Are you sure you're good?

09:20.690 --> 09:22.257
- Dude, seriously,
I'm--I'm fine.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.606
But enough about me.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.042
Like, how are you? <i>
- Oh, good. Good.</i>

09:25.086 --> 09:26.087
Just putting
the finishing touches

09:26.130 --> 09:27.828
on this
eighth anniversary party.

You know,
I want it to be perfect.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.321
'Cause I'm pitching gold
over here.

09:43.365 --> 09:47.195
- Huh?
Yeah. Yeah.

09:47.238 --> 09:50.198
<i>- â™ª I could hardly

10:38.376 --> 10:40.161
- I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out

10:40.204 --> 10:42.990

"Twist of F8,

10:43.033 --> 10:44.948

10:44.992 --> 10:49.431
My wife is the smartest,
kindest person that I know.

10:49.474 --> 10:53.740
And she is so beautiful.
I mean, damn.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.785
- Oh, damn you.
- Oh, damn you.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.657
- Ooh, no, damn you.
- No, damn you.

Damn you.
- Damn you, girl.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.747
- I want to damn you all day.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.532
- You gonna damn you all day?
I'm gonna damn you all night.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.494
I love you so much, baby.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.540
- And I love you too.

11:11.583 --> 11:15.109
Cheers, y'all.
Cheers.

11:15.152 --> 11:18.329
- Hey, guys. Happy anniversary.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.941
- Aw, thanks, girl.
So good to see you.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.378
Noah, I'd love to introduce
to some of my friends

11:23.421 --> 11:24.814
now that you're back
on the market.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.295
There are some baddies here,
and they're all single.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.775
- Well, I mean,
as much as I love the fact

11:28.818 --> 11:30.515
that you refer
to your friends as baddies,

11:30.559 --> 11:31.734
I'm actually gonna head home
in a little bit.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.562
- Wow, he'd rather
go home and ponder

11:33.605 --> 11:35.390
his dead relationship
than stay at the party.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.784
- Mm-hmm. Baby butt.
- Boing, boing.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.307
- You know, I was 12%
gonna go home,

11:39.350 --> 11:41.091
but I'm actually feeling
a second wind.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.789
So yeah. Let's mingle.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.399
You guys better grab
your umbrellas,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.967
because there's about to be
a torrential flirt storm.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.272
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.666
- That is a beautiful dress.
Is that Cushnie?

11:50.710 --> 11:54.148
- Um, yes.
- I'm Noah. Nice to meet you.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.196
- You like kisses?
- Excuse me?

11:59.240 --> 12:02.765
- I'm sorry, I meant, quiches.
Noah. Nice to meet you.

12:02.809 --> 12:06.551
<i>â™ª</i>

12:06.595 --> 12:08.815
- I come to bury Caesar,
not praise him.

12:08.858 --> 12:11.513
The evil that men do
lives after them.

12:11.556 --> 12:14.908
The good is oft interred
with their bones.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.040
So let it be with Caesar.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.825
- Noah. Nice to meet you.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.872
- So what's the latest
with Davis?

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
Is he elephant or donkey?
- I think he's donkey.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.747
He's just so kind,
caring, and giving in bed.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.271
- Yo, see our boy Noah
over there?

12:30.314 --> 12:31.533
- Permission to dance
up on you?

12:31.576 --> 12:33.056
- Permission granted.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.105
- Future's looking quite great
for him right now.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.629
- Meanwhile, the future's not
looking so great for this bar.

12:40.672 --> 12:41.978
Couldn't find a coaster,
Ray Charles?

12:42.022 --> 12:43.371
-
Ray Charles.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.025
That's funny 'cause
he didn't see the coaster.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.027
- And the future's not looking
so great for your facial hair,

12:47.070 --> 12:48.985
over here looking like
a unfinished drawing.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.466
- Ooh, that's a good visual.
- Ha, okay. You're bald.

12:51.509 --> 12:52.772
- Ooh, heyo.
- And you look like you grew up

12:52.815 --> 12:53.947
in a country club, you sellout.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.513
- Ooh, this was fun
just a second ago.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.732
Is everything okay
between you two?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.820
- Oh, I'm all good over here.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.213
- Oh, we're great.
Never better.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.737
- I'ma gonna go this way.
- And I'ma go that way.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.391
- The just happened?

13:03.434 --> 13:04.827
<i>- â™ª Real love</i>

13:09.527 --> 13:11.268
and see where the rest
of the night goes?

13:29.199 --> 13:30.766

13:35.205 --> 13:36.990
- Yo, this place is cool,
right?

13:37.033 --> 13:38.469
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's all right.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.862
- All right, well,
next round's on me.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.559
Anybody need anything?
- Actually, I need a tea.

13:41.603 --> 13:42.952
I would like to have

13:42.996 --> 13:45.172
the "how was the rest
of your night with Kim" tea.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.783
- It was a great night.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.219
You know, she's a dope person.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.655
It was great
getting to know her.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.005
- Man, cut the crap.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.398
Did you put some miles
on the mattress or zwhat?

13:54.442 --> 13:57.184
- A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.664
So I guess I'm a bad boy,
because yeah.

14:01.405 --> 14:02.580
- God is good.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.930
- So when you gonna see her
again, bro?

14:03.973 --> 14:05.061
- Oh, you know,
we're hanging out next week.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.193
- Oh, that's dope. That's dope.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.498
- That's weird,
because Kristen said

14:07.542 --> 14:09.413
that Kim is going out of town
all next week.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.459
- Oh, right. Right.
I meant two weeks. Dinner.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.330
Little Dom's,
little Italian, you know?

14:13.374 --> 14:14.549
- I see.
- Yeah.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.898
- That's also weird
because Kristen said

14:15.942 --> 14:17.421
that Kim is gluten-free.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.423
- I didn't realize how close
Kim and Kristen are.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.555
That's so cool.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.904
- So you getting Italian

14:21.948 --> 14:23.906
in two weeks with a girl
that can't eat pasta?

14:23.950 --> 14:24.994
- Hold on.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.256
You guys smell that?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.649
- Smell what?
I don't smell anything.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.520
- Yeah, because no one can
smell their own lie pie.

14:29.564 --> 14:30.782
You're lying. But why?

14:30.826 --> 14:32.784
- Because he did hook up,
just not with Kim.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.090
- Alicia.
-

14:34.134 --> 14:36.266
- Okay, yes. Yes, we hung out.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.268
We talked and we're both cool
with the casual thing,

14:38.312 --> 14:39.574
so we're on the same page now.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.141
- Those sound like
different pages, homey.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.317
So you can claim to be
as casual as you wanna be,

14:43.360 --> 14:45.449
but sooner or later, your heart
is gonna grab your brain

14:45.493 --> 14:47.887
by the shoulders and scream,
"This is wack!"

14:47.930 --> 14:51.934
- I disagree.
Look, I love Alicia.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.370
And I really wanna
make this work.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.329
And all I've gotten
from each of you is judgement.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.460
Except for you, Wyatt.
Thank you.

14:56.504 --> 14:57.809
You've been very cool.
- Thank you.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.115
- Look, guys, we have
finally found ourselves

14:59.159 --> 15:00.421
a bar that we actually like.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.075
So can you guys
just lay off me for a second

15:02.118 --> 15:03.467
and just let me enjoy
my drinks in peace?

15:03.511 --> 15:05.121
- All right, all right. <i></i>

15:05.165 --> 15:08.516

the rave has begun.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.563

my guy.

15:12.607 --> 15:15.827
<i>â™ª</i>

15:15.871 --> 15:17.873

It's been a week now.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.831
You need to give me
my damn kombucha.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.224
- Who do you think
you're talking to?

15:21.268 --> 15:23.661
I'll get it when I get it.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.011
- Typical.
- Typical what?

15:25.054 --> 15:27.013
- Typical you,
taking your sweet time.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.188
- And typical you,

15:28.231 --> 15:29.972
always buying
single ply toilet paper.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.582
It's like wiping your butt
with cotton candy.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.844
- Again with the toilet paper.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.585
Geez!
- Oh.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.109
Oh, so, wanna slap box now.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.588
Oh, you're too soft
for all of that.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.287
- Soft? I ain't soft.
Let's box then.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.158
- Okay. All right.
- Come on. Whoo!

15:42.202 --> 15:43.855
I'm ready for you, baby.
I'm ready.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.988
- Oh, okay.
That was a quick one.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.076
I didn't know we started yet.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.338
- Yeah.
- All right then.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.426
- All, right, come on.
What you got?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.689
Give me your best shot.
Oh, whoa!

15:51.733 --> 15:54.823
Man, okay.
All right, okay.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.694
Okay. Whoo!

15:56.738 --> 15:59.697
Oh. Whoo! Whoo! Okay.

15:59.741 --> 16:03.353
- Ah! Okay, time out.
Time out. Time out.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.008
I'm not--I'm not stopping
because I'm hurt.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.314
I'm stopping
because my hands hurt

16:07.357 --> 16:08.576
from hitting you too hard.

16:08.619 --> 16:09.969
- Yeah.
- You got a strong jawline.

16:10.012 --> 16:10.882
- Yeah.
- You should be proud of that.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.232
- I am. I am actually.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.190
And I too am stopping
because my hands hurt

16:14.234 --> 16:15.975
and definitely not my face.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.630
- Look, man,
when Noah introduced us,

16:19.674 --> 16:21.328
I was pumped to be living

16:21.371 --> 16:22.982
with one of his homeys
from UCLA.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.288
- Yeah, well, I was pumped
as well.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.551
My homey's homey from home
was bound to be my homey too.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.249
- True.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.772
Sometimes I feel like
you look down on me

16:30.815 --> 16:32.078
because I didn't go to college
like the rest of y'all.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.688
I'm smart too, man.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.733
College wasn't for me,
but I got a 1,580 on my SAT.

16:35.777 --> 16:36.952
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.171
- Damn.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.650
- I'm a dope-ass
test taker, brah.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.174
They used to call me Bubbles
in high school

16:41.217 --> 16:42.697
'cause I was always
filling in the right answers.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.351
And because of my big,
juicy butt cheeks.

16:46.614 --> 16:50.226
- Look, man, you one
of the smartest people I know.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.402
I mean, I didn't know
you got a 1,580.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.708
That's just--
- Why, what'd you get?

16:53.751 --> 16:56.058
- Huh? Right in that zone.
We both did great.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.581
Point is,

16:57.625 --> 17:00.193
sometimes I feel like
you do things to provoke me.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.065
Yeah, I like big sweaters
and my white-collar job,

17:03.109 --> 17:05.285
but that doesn't make me
a sellout

17:05.328 --> 17:07.461
or any less Black than you.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.551
- Yo, I--now that I hear it,
I was wilding, man.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.422
I never meant to make you
feel like that.

17:12.466 --> 17:15.425
You're definitely Black.
Sure as hell slap like it.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.645
- Yo, man, I didn't mean to
make you feel belittled either.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.040
We cool?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.128
- Mm.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.218
<i>â™ª</i>

17:28.308 --> 17:30.527
- Oh, you are so good at that.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.790
- I'm just trying
to make you feel good.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.795
Oh, no.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.668
Oh, no.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.105
Oh, no.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.455
- What is it? What happened?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.153
- I'm sorry.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.329
Are you a Republican?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.766
- Well, yeah.
Is that a problem?

17:51.809 --> 17:53.246
- But you seem so normal.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.205
-
I am normal.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.034
Look, why can't we
just put politics to the side?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.210
I don't care
that you're a Democrat.

18:01.254 --> 18:04.822
I just care that you're funny
and you're smart.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.259
Damn, you turn me on.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.957
- Yeah? You're right.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.220
We shouldn't let politics
get in the middle of this.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.875
You know, with you being
so open-minded and all.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.964
- Excellent.
- Yes.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.493
What are your thoughts
on reproductive rights?

18:23.537 --> 18:26.496
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
Whoo, nope!

18:26.540 --> 18:28.759
- That was a lot of fun.
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.545
- So when can I see you again?

18:31.588 --> 18:33.982
- Maybe next week? Let's text.
- Okay, yeah.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.246
Just so you know, I'll probably
be seeing other people,

18:37.290 --> 18:39.683
since, you know,
we're doing the casual thing.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.424
- Yeah, I mean, you know,
it's what's best, right?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.470
- Right, and just so we clear,

18:43.513 --> 18:46.603
I will be getting intimate
with said people.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.257
For example,
hugging and/or kissing

18:48.301 --> 18:49.867
and/or full-on
sexual intercourse

18:49.911 --> 18:52.087
since I'm totally chill
and all the way casual.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.089
- Yeah, that sounds
pretty casual to me.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.527
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.054
- It's a 2016
de Jean Cab Franc.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.186
Enjoy.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.405
- Thank you.
- Great.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.189
Okay, I know we've been
trying to replace

19:07.233 --> 19:09.757
our old go-to bar,
and I've been thinking,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.889
maybe we should try
something completely new.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.804
- So a wine bar?

19:13.848 --> 19:15.502
- Yeah. It's a fresh start.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.199
- But you're back
with Alicia again, right?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.375
We could just go back
to Dolly Pitchers.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.248
- Nah, we can't.
- Really? What happened?

19:26.339 --> 19:27.340
- Wait, this <i>is</i> wack.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.602
- I'm sorry, what?

19:31.300 --> 19:34.825
- Look, I'm sick of pretending
I'm someone I'm not.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.132
Now, was me thinking
of marriage too early insane?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.568
Yes, it was absolutely crazy.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.571
But when I was 12 years old,
my mother passed away.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.530
And my father was never open
to love after that,

19:43.573 --> 19:46.881
and he just seems so miserable.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.971
So I always promised myself
that I would rather go crazy

19:50.014 --> 19:52.930
running toward love
than running away from it.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.149
And I may have watched

19:54.193 --> 19:56.107
one too many rom-coms
along the way,

19:56.151 --> 20:00.242
but I'm just a boy,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.462
standing in front of a girl,

20:02.505 --> 20:05.987
telling her I don't wanna
have sex with other people.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.468
It's too much pressure,
and what if I forget

20:08.511 --> 20:11.558
which sex moves
are for what person?

20:13.168 --> 20:15.344
Goodbye, Alicia.

20:15.388 --> 20:18.347
- So is Dad's emotional
barrenness after Mom died

20:18.391 --> 20:19.609
the reason why I try to collect

20:19.653 --> 20:21.437
as many dating experiences
as possible

20:21.481 --> 20:23.831
while using humor to keep
my walls up emotionally?

20:25.528 --> 20:27.269
Gulp-boo-da-boo!
I guess we'll never know.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.186
- And yeah, I wasn't just
putting up a front with her.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.667
I-I thought you guys
were judging me.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.146
But now I realize

20:35.190 --> 20:36.626
that you all were just trying
to help me through this.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.716
- Ah, man,
I was judging you a little.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.458
- So yes.
I am soft like baby butt.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.155
But you know what?
That's just who I am, man.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.288
I gotta keep it 100 with myself
and with y'all too.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.289
- To keeping it 100.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.856
To keeping it 100.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.210
- This is dope Cab Franc.
It's bold with a medium body.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.125
I think I taste notes
of blackberry,

20:57.168 --> 20:59.519
maybe a little cocoa in there.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.434
What? Maybe I read
a couple books on wine.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.305
And LeBron drinks it.
Wine is Black now.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.306
- All right.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.438
- I kinda like this place.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.004
- Yeah, I think I like it too.

21:07.048 --> 21:10.704
Ooh, if you'll excuse me,
my next adventure awaits.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.096
That man over there
in a zoot suit--

21:12.140 --> 21:14.925
ooh, he looking at me
like a old-timey snack.

21:14.969 --> 21:17.232
Watch out now.
- All right. I see you.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.320
I see you.
- Here I come.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.452
- Ask him where he got
that suit.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.105
- Looks like
they all discovered

21:21.149 --> 21:25.196
a little more about one another
while also discovering wine.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.589
I told you.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.375
Brothers are out here
feeling things, hmm?

21:29.418 --> 21:31.333
Will they continue
to grow together?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.814
What challenges will come
along the way?

21:33.857 --> 21:36.947
Let's see where this
grand crew goes, shall we?
