00:05.222 --> 00:09.661
- For ages, the Black man
has been seen as many things.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.795
As sketchy, as wild,

00:12.838 --> 00:15.841
as arrogant and insensitive,

00:15.885 --> 00:19.019
but I'm going to let you in
on a little secret

00:19.062 --> 00:20.281
about Black men.

00:20.324 --> 00:23.327
We have a softer,
more sensitive side.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.938
That's right. We love.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.897
The flowers are for his mom.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.160
And it ain't even Mother's Day.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.510
We laugh. Trust me.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.513
That dude is a joy
to be around.

00:35.557 --> 00:39.343
We care.
This guy cares about animals.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.519
That's a bean burrito,
for your information.

00:41.563 --> 00:44.174
And believe it or not, we cry.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.959
My man gets sad sometimes,
and that's okay.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.352
What I'm saying is...

00:50.180 --> 00:53.183
Our multitudes got multitudes.

00:53.227 --> 00:56.099
It feels so good
to get this off my chest.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.842
Thank you for letting me share.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.803
<i>Let's explore all of this
a bit more, shall we?</i>

01:09.504 --> 01:12.072
- Hey, here you go, guys.
Hey, baby.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.117
- Hey.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.466
- Okay.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.821
- Damn, homey, I know I said
don't bang where we hang,

01:22.865 --> 01:24.214
but you got her
slobbing on the job,

01:24.258 --> 01:25.781
so it must be going well.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.739
- How long's it been now?
- Four months.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.524
The thing about her is,
I've never been in love

01:29.567 --> 01:31.352
with someone more
in my entire life.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.701
- What?
- Full stop.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.616
- Bro, you out here
looking like a trampoline.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.792
Extra sprung.
Boing, boing.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.447
- Oh, he's been like this
ever since we were kids.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.275
In elementary school,
every Halloween,

01:41.318 --> 01:43.146
he would dress up
as a loving husband.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.756
- What?
- What is that costume?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.410
- Okay, shut it down
for a second, okay?

01:46.454 --> 01:48.108
Because you guys are making it
sound like I'm a sap,

01:48.151 --> 01:49.587
and I'm definitely not, okay?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.372
Lest we forget, I used to be
out on these date streets

01:51.415 --> 01:53.025
running hella game, okay?

01:53.069 --> 01:54.592
Dates on dates on dates
on dates on dates on dates.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.769
It's just with Alicia,
you know, she's--she's special.

01:57.813 --> 01:58.857
- Oh, come on, man,

01:58.901 --> 02:00.120
every other girl
you meet is special

02:00.163 --> 02:01.338
or one of a kind
or had you at hello.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.687
But I know
what's really going on.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.820
The sex is bomb.
She must be breaking that back.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.605
- For the last time,
can we please not talk

02:07.649 --> 02:09.390
about me having bomb sex
in front of my sister?

02:09.433 --> 02:11.392
- For the last time,
yes, we can.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.221
My sexuality has always been
key to this group.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.919
For example,
I have a Tinder date later,

02:16.962 --> 02:20.140
and I'm hoping it ends with
our crotches getting steamy.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.402
- Oh, thanks, Nicky.
That reminds me.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.143
I'm throwing
an anniversary party next week,

02:23.186 --> 02:24.231
and I expect all y'all
to be there.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.406
- What did Nicky just say

02:25.449 --> 02:26.755
that reminded
you of your anniversary?

02:26.798 --> 02:28.496
- On our honeymoon,
Kristen and I were having

02:28.539 --> 02:31.499
breakfast in bed, and I spilled
mint tea on my crotch.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.978
Steamy crotch.
- That makes sense.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.633
- Oh, yeah, it does.
- So speaking of anniversaries,

02:35.677 --> 02:38.680
feels like now's as good a time
to tell you guys as any.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.597
I'm gonna ask Alicia
to marry me.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.555
What?
- Why would you do that?

02:44.599 --> 02:45.991
- Wait, what's--
what's with the mumbles?

02:47.471 --> 02:48.646
- Seriously, dude, I've had
almond milk in my fridge

02:48.690 --> 02:49.995
longer than you've been
with Alicia.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.432
So maybe you're rushing.

02:51.475 --> 02:52.824
- Or maybe you should drink
your almond milk faster.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.174
- No, man. He's right.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.698
No Black man should get married
before age 75.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.482
You still look the same
and you get more time

02:58.526 --> 02:59.744
to sow your royal oats.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.224
Give me some.
- "Royal oats"?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.487
This isn't "Coming to America,"
and even if it was,

03:03.531 --> 03:05.402
Prince Akeem chose love
over the single life.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.708
Nah, I'm all for it.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.623
I love my queen,
and I'm excited

03:08.666 --> 03:11.191
that you gon' lock it down
with yours, Noah.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.368
Noah.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.457

boing, boing.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.850

What y'all say?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.941
Whoo!

03:22.985 --> 03:24.334
- That sex.
- Mm.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.727
- Wow, that was
a great game out there.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.642
I mean, you really
left it all out on the court.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.470
- I know.
You--you were on fire.

palpable tension.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.770

04:18.954 --> 04:20.825

Also, have you seen
my kombucha?

04:37.712 --> 04:39.104

I drank those.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.426
and smells like fresh lavender.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.995
But at one point in the night,
he did say,

06:27.038 --> 06:28.300
"Thanks, Obama."

06:28.344 --> 06:30.346
- Wait, how'd he say it?
Like, "Thanks, Obama!"

06:30.390 --> 06:33.218
- It was sarcastic.
Like, "Thanks, Obama."

06:33.262 --> 06:35.482

like, a Black Republican.

the streets like that, right?

06:37.875 --> 06:39.268

06:39.311 --> 06:41.357
- I suppose the only way
to figure out what he meant

06:41.401 --> 06:44.665
is to see him again
and have sex with him.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.841
Ow! Thanks, Obama.

06:46.884 --> 06:50.322

Hey, how's that tequila neat?

06:50.366 --> 06:52.063
Looks like they did a good job.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.674

so I guess they did

06:53.717 --> 06:55.502
a pretty good job
pouring tequila in a glass.

Well, Alicia and I broke up.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.860

I was gonna propose

some space,

07:07.296 --> 07:09.037

wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

to Dolly Pitchers anymore?

16:35.777 --> 16:36.952
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.171
- Damn.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.650
- I'm a dope-ass
test taker, brah.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.174
They used to call me Bubbles
in high school

16:41.217 --> 16:42.697
'cause I was always
filling in the right answers.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.351
And because of my big,
juicy butt cheeks.

16:46.614 --> 16:50.226
- Look, man, you one
of the smartest people I know.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.402
I mean, I didn't know
you got a 1,580.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.708
That's just--
- Why, what'd you get?

16:53.751 --> 16:56.058
- Huh? Right in that zone.
We both did great.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.581
Point is,

16:57.625 --> 17:00.193
sometimes I feel like
you do things to provoke me.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.065
Yeah, I like big sweaters
and my white-collar job,

17:03.109 --> 17:05.285
but that doesn't make me
a sellout

17:05.328 --> 17:07.461
or any less Black than you.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.551
- Yo, I--now that I hear it,
I was wilding, man.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.422
I never meant to make you
feel like that.

17:12.466 --> 17:15.425
You're definitely Black.
Sure as hell slap like it.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.645
- Yo, man, I didn't mean to
make you feel belittled either.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.040
We cool?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.128
- Mm.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.218
<i>♪</i>

17:28.308 --> 17:30.527
- Oh, you are so good at that.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.790
- I'm just trying
to make you feel good.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.795
Oh, no.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.668
Oh, no.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.105
Oh, no.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.455
- What is it? What happened?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.153
- I'm sorry.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.329
Are you a Republican?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.766
- Well, yeah.
Is that a problem?

17:51.809 --> 17:53.246
- But you seem so normal.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.205
-
I am normal.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.034
Look, why can't we
just put politics to the side?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.210
I don't care
that you're a Democrat.

18:01.254 --> 18:04.822
I just care that you're funny
and you're smart.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.259
Damn, you turn me on.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.957
- Yeah? You're right.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.220
We shouldn't let politics
get in the middle of this.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.875
You know, with you being
so open-minded and all.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.964
- Excellent.
- Yes.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.493
What are your thoughts
on reproductive rights?

18:23.537 --> 18:26.496
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
Whoo, nope!

18:26.540 --> 18:28.759
- That was a lot of fun.
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.545
- So when can I see you again?

18:31.588 --> 18:33.982
- Maybe next week? Let's text.
- Okay, yeah.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.246
Just so you know, I'll probably
be seeing other people,

18:37.290 --> 18:39.683
since, you know,
we're doing the casual thing.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.424
- Yeah, I mean, you know,
it's what's best, right?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.470
- Right, and just so we clear,

18:43.513 --> 18:46.603
I will be getting intimate
with said people.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.257
For example,
hugging and/or kissing

18:48.301 --> 18:49.867
and/or full-on
sexual intercourse

18:49.911 --> 18:52.087
since I'm totally chill
and all the way casual.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.089
- Yeah, that sounds
pretty casual to me.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.527
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.054
- It's a 2016
de Jean Cab Franc.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.186
Enjoy.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.405
- Thank you.
- Great.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.189
Okay, I know we've been
trying to replace

19:07.233 --> 19:09.757
our old go-to bar,
and I've been thinking,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.889
maybe we should try
something completely new.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.804
- So a wine bar?

19:13.848 --> 19:15.502
- Yeah. It's a fresh start.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.199
- But you're back
with Alicia again, right?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.375
We could just go back
to Dolly Pitchers.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.248
- Nah, we can't.
- Really? What happened?

19:26.339 --> 19:27.340
- Wait, this <i>is</i> wack.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.602
- I'm sorry, what?

19:31.300 --> 19:34.825
- Look, I'm sick of pretending
I'm someone I'm not.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.132
Now, was me thinking
of marriage too early insane?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.568
Yes, it was absolutely crazy.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.571
But when I was 12 years old,
my mother passed away.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.530
And my father was never open
to love after that,

19:43.573 --> 19:46.881
and he just seems so miserable.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.971
So I always promised myself
that I would rather go crazy

19:50.014 --> 19:52.930
running toward love
than running away from it.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.149
And I may have watched

19:54.193 --> 19:56.107
one too many rom-coms
along the way,

19:56.151 --> 20:00.242
but I'm just a boy,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.462
standing in front of a girl,

20:02.505 --> 20:05.987
telling her I don't wanna
have sex with other people.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.468
It's too much pressure,
and what if I forget

20:08.511 --> 20:11.558
which sex moves
are for what person?

20:13.168 --> 20:15.344
Goodbye, Alicia.

20:15.388 --> 20:18.347
- So is Dad's emotional
barrenness after Mom died

20:18.391 --> 20:19.609
the reason why I try to collect

20:19.653 --> 20:21.437
as many dating experiences
as possible

20:21.481 --> 20:23.831
while using humor to keep
my walls up emotionally?

20:25.528 --> 20:27.269
Gulp-boo-da-boo!
I guess we'll never know.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.186
- And yeah, I wasn't just
putting up a front with her.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.667
I-I thought you guys
were judging me.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.146
But now I realize

20:35.190 --> 20:36.626
that you all were just trying
to help me through this.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.716
- Ah, man,
I was judging you a little.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.458
- So yes.
I am soft like baby butt.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.155
But you know what?
That's just who I am, man.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.288
I gotta keep it 100 with myself
and with y'all too.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.289
- To keeping it 100.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.856
To keeping it 100.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.210
- This is dope Cab Franc.
It's bold with a medium body.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.125
I think I taste notes
of blackberry,

20:57.168 --> 20:59.519
maybe a little cocoa in there.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.434
What? Maybe I read
a couple books on wine.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.305
And LeBron drinks it.
Wine is Black now.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.306
- All right.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.438
- I kinda like this place.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.004
- Yeah, I think I like it too.

21:07.048 --> 21:10.704
Ooh, if you'll excuse me,
my next adventure awaits.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.096
That man over there
in a zoot suit--

21:12.140 --> 21:14.925
ooh, he looking at me
like a old-timey snack.

21:14.969 --> 21:17.232
Watch out now.
- All right. I see you.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.320
I see you.
- Here I come.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.452
- Ask him where he got
that suit.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.105
- Looks like
they all discovered

21:21.149 --> 21:25.196
a little more about one another
while also discovering wine.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.589
I told you.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.375
Brothers are out here
feeling things, hmm?

21:29.418 --> 21:31.333
Will they continue
to grow together?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.814
What challenges will come
along the way?

21:33.857 --> 21:36.947
Let's see where this
grand crew goes, shall we?
