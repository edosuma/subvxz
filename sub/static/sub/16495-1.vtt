01:02.280 --> 01:04.044
You, you're out.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.969
How goes it, Mitchel?

01:58.320 --> 02:00.084
Prison makes me nervous, Billy.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.807
Let's go, then.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.285
Here's something new for you.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.530
You can't smoke in the fucking pub.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.409
They done it in Ireland.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.522
They done it, fuck me,
they done it in France.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.363
New York, they've made the fags,

02:21.480 --> 02:24.051
so they burn out
if you leave them in the ashtray.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.124
Tastes like shit as well.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.162
You been to New York, Billy?

02:27.760 --> 02:30.240
Well, that's another
fucking story, isn't it?

02:30.920 --> 02:35.209
The guy that
owned this flat, this doctor,

02:36.880 --> 02:40.566
got into heavy schtook with,
shall we say, a money lender.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.161
Left everything.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.690
-You're the money lender?
-Well...

02:47.080 --> 02:48.525
Part of a firm.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.803
And, we'd like you to be on board.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.931
I don't think so, Billy.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.282
Still, you stay. Think about it. Whatever.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.682
Where you gonna go otherwise, right?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.243
What? £80 they give you
to make your way in London.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.600
In London?

03:14.120 --> 03:17.010
What is it, £47 a week
jobseekers allowance?

03:18.560 --> 03:21.484
850 a week, this place.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.765
On Kennington Road.

03:25.000 --> 03:25.887
Here.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.161
I won't use it.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.282
You need it.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.930
And you need me, mate.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.042
You need your friend, Billy.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.724
There's a party tonight,
of course there's a party.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.365
Usual, down at the Hanover.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.404
Don't be late. it's your party, isn't it?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.928
Did they hurt you in there, Mitchel?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.844
Nah, not so you'd notice.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.570
They hurt me in there, Mitchel.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.527
I know they did, Joe.
It's all right now. Here.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.846
You don't have to do that.

05:01.960 --> 05:05.089
Yeah, I do.
It's a tax you pay for being all right.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.729
You missed the World Cup.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.607
Let's have it.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.002
Fuck off.

05:48.040 --> 05:48.962
Go on.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.085
That's a shit place to park.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.126
You're a legend.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.885
A little something
for a rainy day, mate!

06:22.000 --> 06:23.126
Hers you go, mate!

06:23.720 --> 06:25.131
Welcome back, brother.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.041
Shame we can't talk about work
in a place like this, Mitch.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.846
There's something I want
to throw you way.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.327
If you don't talk about work hero,
Danny, where do you talk about it?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.363
-It's full of fucking reporters, isn't it?
-What?

06:36.680 --> 06:37.761
Do you know what I mean?

06:37.880 --> 06:41.089
Fucking congregation
of fucking southeast villains like this.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.487
I mean, see that one over there? There.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.443
Right, she's writing a fucking book.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.888
And they all want their
fucking picture taken, don't they?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.800
They all want their photo in it.
Fucking bunch of fucking tossers.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.929
The pad you're in, yeah?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.361
I don't need to tell ya
there's no free lunches.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.642
There are other things I can do,
and maybe I want to fucking do them.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.524
No, it ain't like you think.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.683
I ain't going back inside, Billy, ever.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.131
For fucking no one.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.288
Then don't get caught,
you fucking cunt.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.771
There's a bit of a ruckus
in the cellar, lad.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.961
I think it's your sister.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.486
Did you invite my sister?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.726
Me? No.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.406
She's a fucking cow.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.205
Come on, darling.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.081
What are you going to do?
Are you going to kill me?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.770
-Aye, I may.
-You going to kill me?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.411
Hay, hay. Yo, bro. It's all cool, yeah.
it's a'right.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.043
When you're black, I'll fucking tell you.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.651
I told him. I told him it was only kissing.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.805
Christ, Mitch, that ain't right. That's...

07:50.920 --> 07:52.763
I don't give a fuck who it is!

07:52.880 --> 07:54.405
That's Purple Dave's nephew.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.363
-Which Purple Dave?
-Eh?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.764
Hey, what's up?
Whore you going? Mitch?

08:08.760 --> 08:11.445
-You look nice, Briony.
-Yeah? Do you like it? I stole it.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.721
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.001
You get some rest
and no more drinking, right?

08:14.120 --> 08:15.770
I've not been drinking.
I've not been fucking drinking.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.370
-On my meds, some chance.
-Briony, you've been drinking.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.482
-Get some rest.
-I've not been drinking.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.125
I've not... Ugh!

08:21.240 --> 08:23.561
Fuck! Smells like someone's
been drinking in here.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.081
West 11. End of the road.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.407
And make sure
she gets to the front door, yeah?

08:28.520 --> 08:30.284
If you care about me,
you come and take care of me.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.811
We tried that.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.681
Here.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.647
All right.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.847
I haven't been drinking!

09:00.840 --> 09:02.251
Fancy a drink?

09:04.960 --> 09:06.610
All right. Not here.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.445
Somewhere else.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.251
Never again.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.087
Where's Mitch?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.731
Mad Tommy said...
Mad Tommy with the mad hairpiece,

09:16.840 --> 09:20.606
that this party was for a criminal,
just out of Pentonville.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.245
I was a criminal.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.524
Presently, I am just unemployed.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.847
Are you handy?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.048
What, with hammers and such?

09:31.160 --> 09:34.004
I might have something for you.
A job, I mean.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.726
I'm serious. I am.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.083
Is it too little for you now?
What a tradesman makes?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.447
No. I know how little I need.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.686
To be happy?

09:49.600 --> 09:50.567
To be alive.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.240
I'm Penny.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.806
I'm Mitchel.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.209
PENNY: Look, I have this, um, friend.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.525
We go back ages.
She lives in Holland Park.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.723
She's...retired.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.603
Friend your age? Retired?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.290
PENNY: You'd know
who it was if I told you.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.607
She's gone a bit Howard Hughes.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.483
Still blind, you old fraud?

10:51.880 --> 10:53.006
I need a favour.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.282
Jesus Christ, Joe. Put it back.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.404
-I found it in a bin, down the estates.
-Right.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.685
You know what?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.761
Put it away.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.201
Yes?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.687
My name's Mitchel.
I was told that I was expected.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.448
We may well be expecting you.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.484
I've been out of communication.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.531
Go round there and there's a door.
The kitchen door.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.730
Don't.
We keep the curtains closed.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.121
Right.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.885
Are you a thief?

13:36.280 --> 13:37.645
I've never stolen anything.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.091
Why did you go to prison?

13:41.480 --> 13:44.529
I was in an altercation.
It got out of hand.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.121
Do you like violence?

13:48.360 --> 13:51.967
I will hurt someone
before they hurt me.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.571
-Sometimes they come over the walls.
-The paparazzi.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.083
They're outside my house
all the fucking time.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.326
You know, it's got a bit much.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.971
Right.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.447
If they got over, if they got in...

14:07.160 --> 14:08.286
Did you fuck Penny?

14:09.640 --> 14:10.607
No.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.724
That's odd. She's fucked everyone
I've ever met. Except Jordan.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.126
Thank you very much.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.326
Could you get someone
off the property if you needed to?

14:22.440 --> 14:26.411
I mean, if I needed you to,
could you help look after me?

14:32.440 --> 14:33.441
Yes.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.687
Uh, you have to sign a piece of paper.
A...

14:40.800 --> 14:42.689
Non-disclosure agreement.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.370
Do you have a camera phone?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.049
Jordan will take care of everything.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.845
-Money.
-Thank you, miss.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.485
What she does these days, mainly,
is paint.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.843
She has a studio upstairs.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.242
The papers would say she daubs.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.202
See, you're not allowed
to do more than one thing,

15:09.320 --> 15:11.846
which is why a polymath,
such as myself,

15:12.240 --> 15:13.605
prefers to do nothing.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.283
It's all about privacy, you see.
This day and age.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.721
Privacy.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.202
I fancy celebrities
rather like the Olympians of old.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.163
They do wonder out there,
the little people,

15:32.280 --> 15:35.170
what their gods are doing,
who they're fucking,

15:35.280 --> 15:39.490
who they've chained to a rock,
or turned into a fucking ass.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.847
All this could be yours, later,

15:45.720 --> 15:47.529
if you haven't nicked
any Screaming Popes.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.486
Are you fixed up?

15:52.800 --> 15:53.767
For now, I am.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.963
Lt's a nice day,
if you like that sort of thing.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.250
Everything you could possibly need
is in hero. Tools, ladders, paints.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.601
If there's anything else,
we have an account, down the road.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.684
You've seen her in films?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.484
Getting her kit off.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.164
If it wasn't for Monica Bellucci,

16:26.280 --> 16:29.011
she'd be the most raped woman
in European cinema.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.202
And all before the age of 30.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.324
Of course, she's also
very serious about her acting.

16:35.440 --> 16:39.206
Apart from not wanting to do it,
she's incredibly serious about her craft.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.491
Her husband's a fuckwit.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.521
His cars.

16:44.760 --> 16:48.287
He hasn't a call for them.
He's in Spain. Drunk.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.169
They should be covered.
They need to be taken care of.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.520
Yes.

17:03.640 --> 17:07.087
Well, if we could find the fucking titles,
they'd have all have been sold.

17:08.280 --> 17:13.002
You will arrive promptly at 7:30,
work commences at 8:00 sharp.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.407
At 11:00, you'll have a tea break.
At 1:00, lunch for one hour.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.965
-Monday's you'll do painting".
-Jordan, I'm not sure of this...

17:19.079 --> 17:20.844
Please, bear with me.
I'm making all this up.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.689
I'm a model of efficiency.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.848
Wednesdays, the roof.
Thursdays, windows.

17:25.960 --> 17:30.010
Friday, the patio. Saturday, party.
Sunday, go to church.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.010
And pray, I pray you, for all of us entire.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.287
Right.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.161
Are you an actor?

17:36.880 --> 17:37.847
Am.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.925
I'm resting.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.605
You are no longer employed, Mr. Lee.
I thought I made that perfectly clear.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.882
Lighten up, mate.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.571
So I had a camera.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.647
Did I use it?

18:05.760 --> 18:08.570
-Did I?
-You have already been replaced.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.410
I don't think so.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.171
You see, I know too much, don't I? Eh?

18:24.560 --> 18:25.641
Cup of tea, Jord.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.042
Two sugars.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.090
There's a good boy.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.324
Get the fuck out of here,
you fat, fucking cunt!

18:39.440 --> 18:42.967
And you go anywhere near the tabloids,
and I will chop you up in court

18:43.080 --> 18:45.651
until there's nothing loft
but a fucking shin!

18:52.440 --> 18:53.601
Fuck off.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.970
Thank you. No heroin today.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.961
They'll take your photograph
until they realise you're nobody.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.887
They're kind enough to think
we're all somebody, for a minute.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.689
Is next Monday suitable?

19:29.320 --> 19:31.448
Oi! You want a talking to.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.485
He's got no idea, that posh cunt!
No ideal No fucking idea, mate!

19:35.600 --> 19:38.490
You've got to ask yourself how
he became posh in the first place.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.887
His grandfather probably did
your grandfather with a shovel.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.923
You don't want to fuck with me!

19:43.040 --> 19:45.122
I don't have to fuck with you,
you're already fucked.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.561
Out of a job, anyway.
Don't ever go there again.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.968
Oh, we'll see about that.
Your manor now, is it, sh? Eh?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.845
Maybe it's enough for you.
How's your brother?

19:54.880 --> 19:57.121
-What's your name?
-Harry Mitchel.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.247
Bullshit.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.521
You want to see
my driver's license, Les-Les?

20:04.800 --> 20:05.961
Fuck off.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.288
Detective Sergeant Bailey, Mr. Mitchel.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.445
Might I have a word?

20:55.520 --> 20:59.047
Now, we got a daily bulletin about all
ex-prisoners returning to our manor.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.169
And I recognise your name, of course,
but, hey,

21:03.040 --> 21:04.530
there's no address.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.120
Now why no address
when you so clearly have one.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.561
I'm not on parole.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.287
-I'm a free man.
-'Course you are.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.646
Where's the owner?

21:20.120 --> 21:23.124
How about a nice cup of tea?
Two sugars.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.125
Your friend Billy Norton
is sailing close to the wind.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.921
You'd be wise to avoid him.
And dodges like this fiat.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.730
Which, if I were to look into it...

21:40.840 --> 21:42.922
Yeah, I got my eye on you, Mitchel.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.521
You're in my manor.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.048
What is it? What you want?

21:50.240 --> 21:52.322
Consider it rent on the flat.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.280
-I'll see meself out.
-Yeah, you will.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.402
-Fucking cunt.
-I heard that!

22:18.640 --> 22:20.483
You ready to clock in?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.568
You're sailing close to the wind, Billy.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.887
-Eh? What?
-Policeman told me.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.208
You spoke to a fucking copper
about me?

22:28.320 --> 22:29.401
The same one
who got my address from you.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.091
Oh, Bailey? Oh, fuck Bailey.
You don't worry about him.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.205
Right. Hops the fucking lift's working.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.604
We start at the top,
we work our way down, right?

22:38.720 --> 22:39.721
When you finish this gaff, mats,

22:39.840 --> 22:41.365
you want to be near
the front fucking door.

22:41.480 --> 22:42.811
I shit you not.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.841
Get your mum.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.167
Your mum, yeah?

24:02.280 --> 24:03.202
Go on, get...

24:06.320 --> 24:07.401
What have you got for ma?

24:09.520 --> 24:11.204
Let's have a look then.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.801
No, you're a bit short, love.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.082
I had a difficult week.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.487
I had to buy a plane ticket,
my father's got cancer.

24:21.600 --> 24:26.481
Yeah? I could give a rat's fucking arse
about your Hindu psychodramas.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.682
You know, I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you what,

24:29.400 --> 24:31.402
you can double up next week.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.487
-All right?
-Yeah.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.409
-All right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.121
Hello.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.170
I'm Anthony Trent.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.963
This is my house.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.729
That is, it was my house
before it became your house.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.966
And now you want what?

24:53.320 --> 24:56.369
Funnily enough,
I thought I might collect some things.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.529
They made me write prescriptions
apart from everything else.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.166
I'm a doctor. I'm being investigated.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.207
Lt's a sad story, Anthony,
but given the people involved,

25:06.320 --> 25:08.129
I think it will get sadder
if you coma hare again.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.527
I reckoned it was a mistake to come.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.166
Nice night.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.331
Fuck yourself.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.128
How's the eating? You eating?

26:02.480 --> 26:04.721
You know I don't like to sat.
It makes me sick.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.365
There's only so far
I can take care of you.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.603
Mum went down helping you.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.166
Didn't have a life until she had cancer
because of you.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.564
I didn't come here for a lecture.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.125
You cams for a proper food
of meat and vegetables

26:15.240 --> 26:16.401
and you're going to fucking well have it.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.282
If I cook this,
and if you don't sat it, we're done.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.124
-Want vodka.
-I don't have any fucking vodka.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.765
All right? Have a fucking vegetable.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.450
-Want a vodka.
-You can't have vodka with your meds.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.482
I want a fucking vodka.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.682
You can't have fucking vodka
with your meds!

26:56.200 --> 26:57.565
Can't sit with that staring at me.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.884
Join the fucking club.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.964
I already told you
he's not in any condition for visitors.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.684
What is the problem, please?

27:30.800 --> 27:33.167
Ho wants to see our Mr. Anonymous.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.851
-His name is Joe.
-What's his last name?

27:36.600 --> 27:38.489
Matron, I'll deal with this.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.011
As a relative.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.850
A nephew perhaps?

27:42.960 --> 27:45.440
-That's right, I'm his nephew.
-Please.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.644
Joe is not in good shape.
I think he has 24 hours or less.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.727
-What?
-I'm very sorry.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.567
Do you wish to see him?

27:59.720 --> 28:01.802
-Please.
-I'm Dr. Raj...

28:02.320 --> 28:03.481
Mitchel.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.961
Mitchel.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.961
Hello, Joe.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.129
You should see the other guy.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.971
Who is the other guy, Joe?

28:27.280 --> 28:30.204
It's important you tell me
who the other guy is.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.049
It doesn't make a difference.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.766
Yes, it makes a difference.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.128
I don't want to dis, Mitch.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.641
I thought I wouldn't mind, but I do.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.044
Well, that's the difference, Joe.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.046
So you tell me who did this.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.484
Kid from the estates.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.648
About 16.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.600
Footballer.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.321
Real one.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.281
Scouted.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.646
This morphine is a rush, Mitch.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.047
I lived as long as I could.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.366
I tried.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.405
Well done, son. Well done.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.043
-I need a burial plot.
-What?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.970
I don't want to start from the beginning
again and tall you I need a burial plot.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.048
Now if you ask me fucking why.
Just get it done.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.563
It'll cost ya. Not just money.
I told ya, I need your help tomorrow.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.810
-Right.
-None of the lads are...

29:43.680 --> 29:46.286
Now it's one flat. One flat, that's all.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.326
This is it.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.442
You know who I am,
and you know what this is.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.361
He don't leave money here.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.291
Look, just gimme something.
I got to have something.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.323
I told you, I got nothing.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.365
-Where is he?
-He's out.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.765
-You'd better get out of here.
-Eh?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.611
Why? Why's that then?

30:16.720 --> 30:18.768
Why? Without what belongs to me.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.087
Nothing belongs to you.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.004
-What the fuck you say to me!
-My brother's coming over.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.528
-Yeah, your brother is?
-What the fuck you doing?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.244
Fucking get off me! Fuck off!

30:29.360 --> 30:30.771
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Billy?

31:32.200 --> 31:33.929
Nothing broken. Ribs.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.290
Nobody wants to pay compensations.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.524
Bones and teeth, you pay for them.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.721
Right.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.961
We seem to be missing
your NHS number.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.366
Taken care of, Matron. Thank you.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.649
-Right. Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you. No, thank you.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.441
Good man.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.803
I'll fix you up with some pain killers.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.167
I thought you was behind me.
I said that.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.090
I said, if it gets moody, run.
I said that in the van.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.167
No, you didn't.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.811
So what's this...this other job you got?

32:18.440 --> 32:19.566
I don't have a job.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.680
Listen, I run into Les
down the Feathers.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.326
He says... He says you got his job.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.371
He says he don't mind 'cause it's you.

32:28.760 --> 32:33.288
But, car collection in the garage.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.083
It's outrageous, Les says.
Like '60s Silver Cloud.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.011
And her,
Les says she's out of her mind.

32:40.480 --> 32:46.328
Yeah? Well, word's got around
and there's an interested party.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.441
Yeah?

32:49.440 --> 32:52.523
You put it all in a container, right?

32:52.960 --> 32:57.284
Cars, paintings, jewellery, furniture.
Off to Francs.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.125
What's your point, Billy?

33:00.080 --> 33:03.129
Well, it'd be worth knocking it over.
You and me.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.846
We'd have a grateful party.

33:05.960 --> 33:06.927
Billy.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.644
We got that car, them paintings.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.808
Who do you think
the cops will pull first?

33:12.840 --> 33:13.841
Well, there is that.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.644
Put it out of your mind,
you fucking understand me?

33:15.760 --> 33:20.288
Calm down, Mitch. I've been asked.
I asked you. I got me answer. Done.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.410
-What?
-Burial plot.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.762
Courtesy of a mate
you never knew you had.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.601
Same one who wants
the paintings and the cars?

33:41.040 --> 33:44.965
Bury your friend. Or not. Or not.
Up to you.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.368
-Any last words?
-Yeah.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.685
We're all fucked.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.241
Where'd you get the dog?

34:33.360 --> 34:35.567
A lady had him tied to soma railings.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.728
-Where'd you get the Scotsman?
-Outside Marks and Spencer.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.080
-Who's paying him?
So what!

34:40.199 --> 34:41.281
So what!

34:41.400 --> 34:43.129
I gave him a wank
while pretending to be his mum.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.289
- Fuck sake, Briony. Shh.
-It's common in Scotland.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.251
-Did he tell you that?
-No, I just know it.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.521
Come on.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.081
Well...

34:59.320 --> 35:00.367
Well...

35:01.520 --> 35:04.444
if you're a real doctor, do you
do, like, plastic surgery and stuff?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.767
-Plastic surgery?
-I'd quite like my chin done. Ooh!

35:07.360 --> 35:08.771
That's like a bit of a dance.
Do you dance?

35:10.680 --> 35:12.205
Can't dance with this hat.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.003
Is it terrible to say
that I'm enjoying myself?

35:19.320 --> 35:21.209
No, it's essential that
you enjoy yourself.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.125
My wife was a very shrewish woman.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.721
I told her finally,
'I love you, but I want to enjoy my life.'

35:32.080 --> 35:34.321
She was more outraged by that
than anything I'd ever said to her.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.171
I am divorced.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.970
I would like to see your sister, Mitchel,
with your permission.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.209
Sanji, it's a free country.
And you're a good man, but she's...

35:44.320 --> 35:45.731
I don't mind if she's got problems.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.925
Will you let me try?

35:52.680 --> 35:53.966
There we go.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.090
I read a lot in prison, Sanji.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.329
There was a poet named Rilke.
He's got a line.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.407
'Everything terrible
is something that needs our love.'

36:06.000 --> 36:07.923
-And that over there is terrible.
-No.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.241
But it doesn't want your love.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.567
It wants your fucking PIN number.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.127
You're a good man, Sanji,
no good will come of it.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.725
Saving people. Being a saint.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.522
And they just buried one, didn't they?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.322
Will you see her home?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.650
That's what I was talking about.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.246
-Tell her not to pay the piper.
-Oh, no, no, no.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.091
I'll take care of it. It'll be my pleasure.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.484
-How many kids have you got?
-I don't know. Three.

36:42.320 --> 36:45.369
There's a lot you don't know,
you fucking jaffa.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.162
-All right.
-Hi, there.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.171
How was it up the 'Ville?

36:54.120 --> 36:56.122
Better to be out.

36:56.720 --> 36:57.960
Got a favour to ask.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.969
Ask and you shall receive, my son.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.368
Two kids up Kennington Estates
did a Big Issue seller.

37:05.040 --> 37:05.962
Lit him on tire?

37:07.040 --> 37:08.769
Rita of passage.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.323
Rita of passage?

37:18.320 --> 37:19.242
So is that.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.682
Calm down.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.491
-I'll ask around.
-You do that.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.171
One of them's a football player.
Scouted.

37:27.040 --> 37:27.962
Everyone knows who did this.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.084
Someone had better bring me
a fucking name. Someone had better.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.047
Fuck.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.607
-How many in a baker's dozen?
-13.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.881
Thirteen.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.729
Did you have an accident?

38:11.400 --> 38:13.402
A strenuous workout, Jordan.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.366
Are you fit for work?

38:16.920 --> 38:19.127
Work is what you do when you'd
rather be doing something else, right?

38:20.040 --> 38:21.565
Always has been for me.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.969
I get them from Hong Kong.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.485
Not personally.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.889
How did you become a criminal,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.162
since you're not a big oink
with a missing chromosome?

38:57.760 --> 38:59.125
Do you want the real answer?

39:01.960 --> 39:04.167
Well, I was thinking
about something else.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.401
And what were you thinking about

39:05.520 --> 39:06.760
when you were thinking
about something else?

39:07.200 --> 39:10.727
Whatever it was, I wasn't
thinking about it clearly enough.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.845
We used to have parties.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.891
My husband's half-sister's stepfather
had a daughter by his previous...

39:16.000 --> 39:18.207
God, no,
I think it was his second previous.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.520
Strapping girl with big teeth
and dyslexia.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.402
She got married here under an awning.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.523
So did I. it's the Cape Canaveral
with shitty marriages.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.362
Well, it's the garden for it.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.610
So what was it like in prison?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.963
The truth is, it was embarrassing.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.607
Hmm.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.080
There's something
to say about those roses,

39:43.200 --> 39:44.850
but I can't think what it would be.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.285
-Well...
-No, I don't want a plan for them.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.401
They're beyond fucked.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.649
Now, you'd better go inside.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.285
-They're on the roof. They're up there.
-Shit!

39:53.400 --> 39:54.890
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Up here, for fuck's sake!

39:55.360 --> 39:56.725
Show us something!

39:57.720 --> 40:01.122
One day I wondered
what a shot of me dead would be worth.

40:01.840 --> 40:04.047
They pay big for morgue photos.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.365
Charlotte, you filthy slag!

40:11.480 --> 40:14.324
is that your new fuck buddy, Charlotte?

40:19.760 --> 40:21.171
What are you running away for?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.048
Charlotte, suck his cock!

40:27.760 --> 40:29.000
I went to RADA.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.164
Have I seen you in anything, Jordan?

40:31.800 --> 40:34.280
Well, I was on a kids' show.

40:36.480 --> 40:37.891
Then I was on methadone.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.484
Then I was a producer.

40:41.880 --> 40:42.881
Seriously.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.840
Listen, Jordan, I think you should
consider a bit more security.

40:54.080 --> 40:58.005
Burglar lights. Basically everywhere.
And the house isn't wired all that well.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.404
You'd be the expert.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.009
I'll leave you to it, all right.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.565
Let's go inside.

41:46.520 --> 41:47.567
Yeah.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.884
How you finding the place?
You comfortable?

41:50.640 --> 41:52.768
No, I'm talking to someone else.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.884
Well, don't hurt him hurt him.
Fucking hurt him.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.846
Yeah. What is it with you?

41:59.480 --> 42:02.768
Yeah. Bye, bye, bye, bye.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.330
Bunch of fucking morons.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.728
These people drive you fucking crazy.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.041
Cunts.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.321
Warm, isn't it?

42:22.800 --> 42:25.610
You haven't got a mobile, have you?
Get him a mobile.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.166
One with an answering machine
so we can keep in touch.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.887
Do you read books?

42:38.040 --> 42:41.249
-Yeah.
-Ah, just finished reading a book.

42:42.960 --> 42:47.841
The jury's still out whether we're
noble savages or just fucking savages.

42:48.480 --> 42:51.927
All them years on an inquiry,
they still don't fucking know.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.410
What do you think'?

42:54.520 --> 42:56.284
Soma ware noble, soma ware savages.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.766
Uh-huh.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.810
Fucking savages.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.285
That was good
what you done in Brixton.

43:08.400 --> 43:13.088
Took a lot of heart to stand up
half a dozen mechanical Islamics.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.726
Fuck me.
Who knows what them cunts get up to.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.481
There was four of them.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.921
-Yeah.
-What it took was stupidity.

43:22.840 --> 43:23.921
This cunt...

43:25.400 --> 43:27.289
What is this cunt doing?

43:28.120 --> 43:30.771
No, no, no.
That's not stupidity, you see.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.411
No. Stupidity runs away like a cunt,

43:34.520 --> 43:36.488
and then a bigger cunt,
he comes back to me

43:36.600 --> 43:38.887
and tolls ma that ha fucking run away.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.360
See, a man like you,
you send a message.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.608
What? That I can take a beating?

43:45.720 --> 43:47.882
I'm only alive
because they saw me hit Billy.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.567
Yeah, well.
They were very decent Zulus.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.401
Decent no more.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.050
-They don't know who's behind Billy.
-Right.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.128
You have to be very careful about that,
you see?

44:01.920 --> 44:05.367
Cunts like Billy, they've always got
someone behind them. Am I right?

44:06.560 --> 44:09.211
I mean even a spade who's just
come out of a fucking tree.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.241
You can never imagine
some cunt like that was in charge.

44:12.360 --> 44:14.328
Can you fucking imagine it?

44:17.320 --> 44:22.281
Yeah, well, I'm gonna put you in charge
of a high rise in Peckham.

44:23.720 --> 44:27.691
Need a bit of discipline there, you know,
been one or two boom-boom incidents.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.087
The natives are restless
and all out of bollocks.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.680
I see. I'm very honoured.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.364
But I'm still learning the ropes.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.084
That's old Navy talk.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.004
In case you don't quite understand
what that means,

44:49.920 --> 44:52.890
it means you have to learn the ropes
before you become an able seaman.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.970
-You understand that?
-Specialized business, isn't it?

44:56.080 --> 44:58.447
-Hmm.
-So I think I should hold off.

45:03.120 --> 45:06.090
Well, if you want to tag along
with that cunt a little bit longer,

45:06.200 --> 45:07.964
than that's up to you.

45:14.200 --> 45:15.361
Oh, fuck me.

45:16.400 --> 45:17.686
Bit early for that.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.931
Oh, I got a little surprise
for you Thursday night.

45:23.360 --> 45:24.407
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

45:25.080 --> 45:27.651
He'll pick you up. if he's still about.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.325
Good night, sweetheart.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.810
She in there or what?
You giving her one?

45:36.920 --> 45:37.921
Yeah, you're a guy working.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.121
We're just guys working, tool

45:39.240 --> 45:40.810
-PHOTOGRAPHER 1: is she in there?
-She's not here.

45:40.920 --> 45:42.524
Oh, come on,
she must be in there, yeah?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.369
Who's giving her one?
You must know who's giving her one.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.606
Give us something, mate,
I've got kids to feed.

45:45.720 --> 45:46.721
What's your name, yeah?

45:46.840 --> 45:48.365
Come on!

45:48.480 --> 45:50.289
Come on,
who are you? You doing her, yeah?

45:53.640 --> 45:58.202
Her husband crashed a car in Spain
and incinerated a fucking viscount.

45:58.840 --> 46:01.525
-Lovely.
-Now I have a dental situation.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.646
She wants to know if you can drive.
Can you drive?

46:28.120 --> 46:31.522
So, you're not a criminal.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.447
You're just like anybody
who might have gotten pinched

46:35.560 --> 46:37.130
for hitting someone in a bar.

46:37.960 --> 46:40.611
-There was more to it than that.
-Was or is?

46:42.800 --> 46:43.767
Was.

46:46.280 --> 46:48.851
So what do you want out of life, Mitch?

46:48.960 --> 46:51.201
Out of all this worthless shit?

46:51.320 --> 46:54.210
Enough to sat, a bed to lie in.
So I can think.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.441
You had that in jail.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.091
Could you get me a drink?

47:05.800 --> 47:06.926
A scotch.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.689
This place is a mausoleum.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.449
I didn't offer you one.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.369
-It's all right.
-No, it isn't.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.004
Listen, what you are,

47:43.960 --> 47:45.371
it's not what everybody is.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.162
It's all right to have trouble
with the basics.

47:51.480 --> 47:53.289
It would be odd if you didn't.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.090
Whore would you be if you were me?

48:04.920 --> 48:06.206
Los Angeles.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.442
There's no milk
and mice shat in the sugar.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.448
I suppose a biscuit's
out of the question.

48:29.560 --> 48:30.766
Fuck off.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.765
What we here for?

48:34.280 --> 48:35.441
To pack.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.371
They're not here yet.

48:42.440 --> 48:43.805
They will be.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.405
You've been down to my property.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.404
You took money from my Mitchel.

48:57.240 --> 48:58.571
-But Billy Norton said it was...
-No.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.251
Billy Norton is a cunt.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.448
Fuck Billy Norton. Fuck you.

49:08.280 --> 49:09.566
How much you take off my Mitchel?

49:10.520 --> 49:12.204
-Fifty.
-Giz it.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.165
Who do you work for?

49:19.280 --> 49:20.725
-The police...
-No, that's your day job.

49:21.720 --> 49:22.721
Cunt.

49:24.600 --> 49:28.650
You go down to my property again
and take my money off my boys

49:29.720 --> 49:31.688
and you'll end up in there.

49:34.320 --> 49:35.321
Is that clear?

49:35.960 --> 49:37.041
Nothing clearer.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.565
How's your egg sarn?

49:43.400 --> 49:45.562
-It's all right.
-Is it? Lovely.

49:46.520 --> 49:47.681
Fuck off.

49:48.560 --> 49:49.641
Go on.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.403
You can't seriously advise me

50:01.520 --> 50:02.885
that what I've been doing
is worth anything.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.729
Yes, I can. I just did.

50:06.760 --> 50:08.250
Do you know what
a woman's for in film?

50:08.360 --> 50:09.327
Go on then.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.930
What this job is
that I'm supposed to want?

50:11.040 --> 50:13.327
-I'm listening.
-A woman is there

50:13.440 --> 50:15.920
to get the hero to talk about himself.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.771
About his hopes. About his fears.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.326
Maybe even about his
fascinating fucking childhood.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.329
But I can't... I can't do it.

50:26.480 --> 50:28.482
Either you're getting your kit off,

50:28.600 --> 50:32.730
opening up the trousers or brains
of an idiot in a piece of shit.

50:32.840 --> 50:37.368
Or you're shooting MOS in Genoa
with some geriatric Italian pervert

50:37.480 --> 50:41.121
who really artistically needs the hero
to stick his thumb up your arsehole

50:41.240 --> 50:43.481
in the 17th sex scene.

50:43.680 --> 50:44.761
Right.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.247
Do you like the place?

50:50.120 --> 50:51.531
-Needs a bit of work.
-Yeah.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.445
You know, I was in Italy.

50:57.880 --> 50:58.961
And...

51:01.520 --> 51:03.284
And I started to fizz.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.084
My arms felt light.

51:11.680 --> 51:12.761
Dirty.

51:17.560 --> 51:20.245
My mind was racing
and I couldn't breaths.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.809
And I thought that I was going to die.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.362
I'll have a week for myself.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.121
A bath.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.850
But then I couldn't go out again
and now it's all this.

51:46.320 --> 51:47.924
You ever had it since?

51:49.720 --> 51:50.801
Fear?

52:03.960 --> 52:05.007
Um...

52:06.560 --> 52:09.166
Thanks for coming on,
for taking the job.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.046
I haven't taken the job.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.280
Good night.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.529
The man who did this,
did the White House.

52:30.840 --> 52:34.526
Seriously, went to America, as one
does when things go wrong.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.721
I've heard of that.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.568
You spent the night with her?

52:42.040 --> 52:44.088
I'm going to pretend
you didn't ask the question.

52:44.920 --> 52:48.402
-Did she toll you why she quit working?
-She doesn't like it.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.806
Doesn't see the point.

52:50.360 --> 52:51.930
She didn't tell you why she quit?

52:53.840 --> 52:55.569
She was raped in Italy.

52:57.880 --> 53:00.121
There were no police involved,
no newspapers.

53:00.240 --> 53:02.163
She can't really report things.

53:02.800 --> 53:06.486
-What happened to the man who did it?
-Well, it's an interesting story.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.962
Turns out there were Quaaludes
dissolved in his Adescian Chianti.

53:12.320 --> 53:13.810
A fucking lot of Quaaludes.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.489
He's on a machine in Barnet.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.688
You're late. You knew about it.

53:31.600 --> 53:33.523
What's the surprise, Billy?

53:34.320 --> 53:36.084
You'll see, won't you?

53:51.320 --> 53:54.927
Good of you to turn up, Mitchel.
Was this cunt late?

53:56.040 --> 53:58.122
You know Mr. Beaumont
and Mr. Fletcher.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.801
He's not one of them.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.368
-He's not one of them?
-He's not one of them.

54:05.480 --> 54:08.768
-He's not one of them, Billy.
-He's got a fucking foreskin, mate!

54:09.200 --> 54:11.282
I got done by the Nation of Islam!

54:11.680 --> 54:14.490
-And even if he was one of them...
-And even if he was, what?

54:15.720 --> 54:18.803
What, you go down there, Bill,
and pick up the first black boy you saw?

54:20.080 --> 54:23.687
Example, you said.
Even if it wasn't him, which it is him.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.689
Well, it fucking is now.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.964
You know when I was a kid,
I was underprivileged, yeah?

54:40.120 --> 54:43.124
My mother, don't get me wrong,
she kept a nice place and that.

54:43.240 --> 54:46.323
Just after the war,
weren't a lot of money about.

54:47.000 --> 54:53.042
But you know what, I remember
driving my girlfriend to Bermondsey,

54:53.160 --> 54:55.447
so she could go to a party
with another boy.

54:55.720 --> 55:00.726
Well, she didn't think I know.
But I did. I fucking know.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.291
She made me foal like a right cunt.

55:05.320 --> 55:06.242
What's that got to do with me?

55:07.840 --> 55:08.887
Fuck!

55:12.440 --> 55:14.169
Fuck me. Look at that.

55:15.400 --> 55:16.606
Right in the heart.

55:17.880 --> 55:19.211
Well, ain't we all.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.170
You're an accessory now.

55:22.600 --> 55:25.410
It's a bit like being married,
you know. it's for life.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.522
Now, men that take it to the next level,

55:30.520 --> 55:32.761
Except keeping a guy like Billy
from fucking up.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.645
-Well, we're of the same mind, here.
-You stupid cunt!

55:36.960 --> 55:40.760
Bill, take that down the estate, will you?

55:43.520 --> 55:45.522
-That could be difficult, Mr. Gant.
-Oh, really?

55:48.280 --> 55:51.045
Take that cunt down the fucking estate.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.960
Make the other fucking Zulus see it.
Or I'll fucking bury you, cunt!

55:55.320 --> 55:57.846
Now I'd invite you for a drink,
but I'm running a bit bad at the moment.

55:57.960 --> 56:00.804
You should ask a man before you
put him under this sort of contract.

56:00.920 --> 56:03.127
Yeah? Let's have a word.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.211
I didn't ask to know your business.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.810
I don't want to know
your fucking business!

56:09.920 --> 56:11.684
Well, now you know
my fucking business.

56:11.800 --> 56:14.929
What you want and what you don't want
are two different fucking things.

56:15.240 --> 56:17.402
-Now are we still friends?
-You're safe, if that's what you mean.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.490
As houses. Now, I know you.
And I know that cunt.

56:20.760 --> 56:22.091
You want me to kill him?
I'll fucking kill him now.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.850
-I didn't say that.
-You did.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.962
No, no, no. That's what you said.
You said it.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.686
-You said exactly that.
-Take it as you like, I didn't say that.

56:28.800 --> 56:29.961
You don't have a cunt like that
working for you.

56:30.080 --> 56:32.321
-I didn't fucking say that!
-You fucking said it. You fucking said it!

56:32.440 --> 56:36.126
You said it. You know what the most
powerful fucking thing is?

56:36.400 --> 56:40.200
Yeah, knowing what can go wrong.
For anybody, at any fucking time.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.845
Do you know that?

56:48.280 --> 56:49.406
Well...

56:50.920 --> 56:52.524
Look, what we shouting for?

56:53.400 --> 56:55.482
-Why... Why are we shouting?
-Fuck!

56:56.480 --> 56:58.323
We don't shout at one another a lot.

56:58.520 --> 57:01.171
Let's do lunch,
we'll sit down somewhere nice.

57:01.560 --> 57:04.882
Have a chat. Like fucking men!

57:08.400 --> 57:09.447
Cunt.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.410
Fucking cunt.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.327
What do you think'?
I want to live there.

57:32.440 --> 57:35.284
When I was a kid, I imagined a big
fuck-off house in London, this house.

57:35.640 --> 57:37.085
But it's his house.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.362
You have money of your own, right?

57:40.600 --> 57:42.967
-You ever had much money?
-On and off. Not freedom.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.844
-What's that?
-What?

57:47.680 --> 57:50.889
I'm not being a fucking existentialist
with a Gauloise,

57:51.480 --> 57:53.005
I'm just asking a question.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.369
Ask another one.

57:57.280 --> 58:01.171
How would you fool about
going to a restaurant? Like people?

58:03.080 --> 58:04.570
You would be sitting in a restaurant
with a man

58:04.720 --> 58:06.484
who just got out of Pentonville,

58:07.520 --> 58:09.522
after doing three years for GBH.

58:12.320 --> 58:14.004
As much as I love the idea,

58:15.200 --> 58:17.646
I think it's the worst thing
I could possibly do to you.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.890
Yeah, you'd be ripped apart.
I wouldn't want that.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.729
Okay, I'm going to be very brave hare.

58:31.840 --> 58:34.366
I'm going to be very bold
and very brave.

58:38.200 --> 58:40.806
If I fell a little in love with you
in the countryside,

58:44.400 --> 58:45.731
what would you do about it?

58:46.720 --> 58:47.926
Anything.

58:53.240 --> 58:54.526
Everything.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.603
I was talking shit earlier
about going to a restaurant.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.005
-I can't. I mean, I can't even...
-I know. I know.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.881
is she in there, mate!

59:08.000 --> 59:09.684
Oi, where's the cunt with the long hair?

59:11.960 --> 59:13.610
There's nowhere to hide, mate!

59:18.000 --> 59:18.967
Are you fucking her?

59:19.080 --> 59:20.081
You are, aren't you?

59:20.200 --> 59:22.248
But she smells lovely!

59:28.280 --> 59:31.329
There he is!
Up here mate, smile for the camera!

59:47.440 --> 59:52.367
I want you to organize collections,
Streatham, Clapham and Kennington.

59:53.520 --> 59:56.091
-Don't know about that, Mr. Gant.
-Call me Rob.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.249
I'm not expecting you
to go door to door, not in that suit.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.010
Fuck me, have a look at you.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.207
You know you could be
anything you want to be.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.481
That's what I've always heard.
'You could do anything}

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.602
Yeah.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.248
People don't get given chances.
Not like the chance I'm giving you.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:22.363
Now, your mate Mr. Norton,
your friend Billy.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.169
He couldn't run a firm,

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.409
he couldn't even bring me
the right spade.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.042
I can recommend the lemon sole,
it's blinding.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.411
Bit flash in here, I know,
but it's fucking British, isn't it?

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.201
I'll have the steak, rare and mash.
Thank you.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.805
I want to go with the lemon sole

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.491
and some mashed potatoes with it,
and a few bobby beans.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.402
Start with bottle of Sancerre
and a bottle of Haut-Brion.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.209
And a glass for each one.
One glass, the right fucking glass.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.204
-Sir?
-Send me the sommelier.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.291
You know, the wine geezer.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.886
You're looking for two Kennington kids
who bashed up some old wino.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.203
One of them is a young footballer
with promise.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.005
And I've got a lot of money
behind him. Future revenue.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.489
Also, it's the love for the game.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.046
-Isn't that lovely?
-Well, he's the bells of the ball.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.326
Right.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.442
No one's going to put him
in a frame, Mitch.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.207
You like this gaff?
You like the life, yeah?

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.290
Well, you're going to have to
give up your day job.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.209
-Not a chance.
-Ah.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.450
Lovely out in the country, isn't it, mate?

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.847
That's proper England, you know.
Jerusalem.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.003
You're a fucking gangster.
You're part of my firm.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.242
Well, there are times when a gangster

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.286
-Is something to be.
-And when is that?

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.766
You're not gonna come and work
for me, that's obvious.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.530
So when the fuck is it?

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.049
You saw ma shoot that fucking spade.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.641
Eh?

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.561
You really think I'm going to let you
walk free around this fucking planet?

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.761
It ain't gonna happen.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.122
Sea what you have to understand
is that if I was a gangster, Rob,

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.566
-you'd be the first to fucking dis.
-Huh.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.642
I wouldn't work for you. I'd kill you
and take everything you've got.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.726
-Oh.
-If I were a gangster.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.090
That's why you don't want me
to be a gangster.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.770
That's why nobody wants me
to be a gangster,

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.406
'cause I could not stop if I started.
Do you get it?

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.085
Don't ask again.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.841
That's for the steak.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.366
Welcome.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.129
I was just getting very high.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.842
Of course you are. it's 6:00 a.m.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.083
You haven't been paid yet.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.924
Rent on the flat.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.449
I'm not taking the job.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.525
You all right?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.527
Well, I wasn't expecting you,
but you'll do.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.286
This is my two friends.
Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Beaumont.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.204
-All right?
-Yeah.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.044
So what are you doing here?

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.684
I thought the place would be empty.
I came to collect some things of mine.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.441
-Of yours?
-That I'd left behind when l...

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.085
When I had to leave.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.409
You had to get your things in my flat?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.090
It sounds silly, but it used to be mine.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.089
No, no, no, no. It was never yours.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.971
-Since I still had a key.
-Oh, you still got a key, yeah.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.371
-But that's...
-That's my key.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.606
You all right? Don't be nervous,
there's no need to be nervous.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.644
-I'm not nervous.
-You're not?

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.002
-No.
-What, you always like that?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.001
What?

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.128
When I was a kid I used to love
going to the seaside with my uncle.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.163
Well, he wasn't my uncle.
He was with my mum.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.361
She had me, but he wasn't my uncle.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.042
He used to do things to me.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.921
You know how that made me foal?

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.930
Did you hear about Kennington?

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.491
-No.
-Go fuck yourself, Danny.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.840
Everyone knows who I'm looking for

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.883
and no one's bringing him to me.
I don't like that, Danny.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.088
All right, but you didn't hear it from me.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.407
What's his name and where is he?

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.643
I can't be seen with you, here, ever.
Not in England.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.641
I don't want them to take
your photograph. They can't have you.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.409
There's no need for that.
No need for that, Mitch!

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.363
Shall we go for a ride, Billy,
you and me?

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.891
Or are you gonna
get the hell out of here?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.729
-You're fucked, mate.
-How's that, Billy?

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.889
Gant's got a hard-on for you.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.923
-I ain't a fucking homosexual.
-Fuck this Gant's...

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.768
Fuck this Gant's homosexual shit.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.288
If he is, if he is, free country, isn't it?

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.883
I get you... l... I get you
the sweetest deal

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.611
and you shit all down it.
You just shit all down it.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.367
Your head's all fucked up. Eh?

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.560
It's all fucked up in your head.
Ho said you owe him, you owe him.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.091
I don't owe him anything.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.082
Get out of here, Billy.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.287
-Give us me some fucking keys then.
-One last thing.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.808
Three years ago when I did that guy,
how did your hands look afterwards?

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.566
How did your hands look, Billy?
You think I didn't fucking know?

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.082
-You think I didn't fucking know, Billy?
-You're gone! You're gone, man!

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.729
-I'm talking to a zero!
-Don't come around here again!

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.526
Gant wants that motor. Wants it!

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.723
Wants that fucking...
Wants that Bacon painting.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.126
-Wants it.
-It's not want he wants.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.561
Watch out for a
big Bosnian fucker!

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.290
Next time, he'll come!

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.209
PHOTOGRAPHER 1: Hey, hey,
hey! Whoa.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.611
-Have a word. Don't be shy.
-Hey, what's the rush?

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.491
-Who do you think that is?
-Some cunt.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.726
How do you fool about guns, Jordan?

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.927
My dear boy, I'm a trained actor.
I can feel anything about anything.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.283
You took it from a passing philosopher,
So what!

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.642
You got somewhere to put it?

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.721
I do.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.004
I need to borrow a car.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.491
Why fuck around?

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.645
Hello, Billy.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.847
-Fuckin' AI
-Get up! Get up!

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.967
Don't! Fuck! Fuck!

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.403
Come here! Come here!

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.931
We can... We can work it out!

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.605
-You're hurting me.
-You were in my house, Billy,

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.769
-where I fucking live!
-He told me to go.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.531
What happened to the owner
of my old place, Billy? Huh?

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.243
It was... It ain't to frame you, I swear.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.091
-The fuck it isn't.
-That fucking stupid bastard,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.807
he went in and he tried to get in
to get some fucking clothes.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.160
-Who?
-I don't know. I don't know.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.329
Yeah. So, Gant lost it! Yeah,
you know like he done that night

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.570
with the fucking spade!
He fucking lost it.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.764
Yeah, so he took the cunt down
to fucking Brighton.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.167
Ho took him down, he fucked him
up the fucking arse

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.568
and he cut his fucking head off, man!

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.484
I swear, Gant will kill everybody!

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.082
Yeah, everyone who belongs to you,
I swear, everybody.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.804
Does he know about my sister?

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.162
Everybody knows about your sister.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.288
Come here! Come here!
Look at me, you cunt!

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.961
Mitch! Mitch! Mitchy, it's me,

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.688
You remember me,

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.287
Come here.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.086
No, no, no. That's Gant's money.
That's Gant's money, don't touch it.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.851
No, it's not, Billy. No, it's not.
Just another fuckin' gangster, Billy.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.048
All the money is mine.
All the fucking money is mine!

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.969
Don't! Give me that money.
I'll give you my own fucking money.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.242
-Shay there!
-I'll give you my own fucking money.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.490
What have you done to ma?

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.929
-Is he all done and dusted?
-It's Mitchel.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.286
And what physical condition
is that Billy in?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.644
Can we talk a little business, Rob?

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.526
I don't foal we got too much more to say.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.642
Any more out of you and I'll be
paying you a fucking visit

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.250
and I'll cut your fucking throat!

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.441
BOY 1: That's mine!
BOY 2: Give me.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.131
BOY 1: That's mine, you cunts!

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.730
Don't you love this place?
My friend owns it.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.201
So what!

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.210
This is my sibling, Mitchel.
Mitchel, this is Alfons.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.361
A pleasure.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.485
I shall order for you both.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.609
Yeah, all right, but nothing nasty.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.968
-That's Alfons.
-Without a doubt.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.801
Have you been drinking?

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.288
Can we not talk about
anything important for a change?

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.522
Like the fact I've loft Dr. Raj...

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.246
No longer. Ms. and Dr. Raju, finito.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.530
You took his PIN number?

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.724
-What?
-His PIN number?

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.050
money, money, money,
it's all you aver talk about.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.128
-Your tie's undone.
-Yeah, it's been a long day.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.289
Listen. There are some people after me.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.403
-And they might try and hurt you.
-Ooh!

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.006
-Yeah.
-Ooh!

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.130
Very much so. So I want you out of
the country until I settle something.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.761
Well, the world's got an infinite
number of places, could be anywhere.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.400
Yeah, one of them's Paris.
Here, a train ticket.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.885
Ooh, Paris!

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.205
All right. But I'm going to need
more money than my usual.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.924
-Nona.
-Of course.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.644
-Yeah?
-No excuses.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.081
And stay there, right. Until I call.

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.802
You're not my dad, all right?

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.606
Alfons, can we get...

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.204
What should we have...
Two triple Sambucas on fire.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.243
-Briony.
-Make sure they're on fire.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.281
I like it when you take care of me.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.406
I love you.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.489
Mitchel, I'm not going to drink,
I promise I won't drink.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.443
I promise I won't drink!

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.370
Yeah, can I get my Sambucas please,
Alfons?

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.527
-You haven't been anywhere.
-Not yet.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.930
I've taken a job.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.051
That's good.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.000
-I have to go to LA.
-Get out of London.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.367
-Yeah, it doesn't suit me.
-Right.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.489
Will you come with me?

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.081
There's something I have to do first.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.764
But you'll come to America?

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.925
Yeah, I will.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.766
-Heard of the Chateau Marmont?
-Yeah.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.567
They have a list, it doesn't exist.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.525
Your name will be on it.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.801
Watch out for a big
Bosnian fucker!

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.445
Next time, he'll come!

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.284
You have a visitor.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.121
I'm not sure how to say this,

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.446
but it's the sort of thing a celebrity

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.040
really cannot afford to have
in the newspapers.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.328
What are we going to do with him?

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.962
Billy's get found dead everywhere.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.967
I'm going to need your help.
Are you able?

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.884
If I can poison a producer
with his own Quaaludes,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.287
I should say I'm equal
to just about anything.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.881
Compared to most people,
I'm a fucking Borgia Pope.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.247
What do you intend to do
about this Bosnian fucker?

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.846
This Storbor?

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.531
Kill him. Kill who hired him.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.041
We're gonna need e fuck
of a lot of drugs.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.924
You have found your man.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.567
Right.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.361
I am what I say I am.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.967
Lads!

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.484
I hear you've been looking for me.

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.323
You have balls, my friend.
I'll buy you a drink.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.283
No, I want to do a deal.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.448
Did you find something
at your house, huh?

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.689
That was a funny thing you did.
I like your style.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.931
-You coming?
-As long as my new friend comes too.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.930
-You're so fucked, mate!
-Yeah, why not.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.724
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.889
You ever heard of the Beatles?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.886
Niet.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.605
John Lennon was me uncle.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.129
Who's this wanker?

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.131
I love you.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.443
-Yeah.
-What does he mean, getting paid?

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.885
Does everyone get this high?

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.682
What do you mean, getting paid?

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.283
As in, you do Gant, I'll double it.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.408
Have you got the balls to kill Gant?

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.970
I have killed babies.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.730
That's good to know.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:34.001
Let it happen, mate. You're done.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.287
Mr. Mitchel, look, I won't say anything!

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.250
it's not just grass.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.321
Fuck!

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.771
-Hello.
-Briony, where are you?

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.407
-I'm in Paris, where else?
-Good girl. Slay there, all right?

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.527
All right.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.641
Breathe.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.167
Fuck!

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.006
Briony?

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.525
Where's Briony?

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.565
Well, well, well.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.489
What lovely surprises.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.528
Oh, you have no fucking idea.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.728
Thank you for coming in.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.207
Would you get down there, please?

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.487
What the fuck are you doing?
That's just dope, mate.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.726
Please.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.286
Right here. Right here.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.082
Yes?

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.609
-How the fuck did you get in?
-Your missus let me in.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.131
I've got 60 grand here. In this room.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.406
Got it.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.651
Don't open it.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.920
-Why not?
-Because there's a fucking gun in it.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.850
Out you come.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.166
Get into bed.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.403
You and me could be great.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.451
People will remember us.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.681
-It's funny what you remember.
-Oh, yeah.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.682
I wrote a poem for a girl once,

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.047
she signed her name to it
and gave it to her other boyfriend.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.282
What's that got to do with me?

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.645
My client has no knowledge
of any of these matters.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.886
At the time of the incident,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.651
my client was already in transit
to the United States.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.964
Heard you'd been looking for me.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.520
This is a matter for
the London Metropolitan Police.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.130
No further questions at this time.
