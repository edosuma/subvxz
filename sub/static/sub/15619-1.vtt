02:41.941 --> 02:43.341
Our world is gone now.

02:46.049 --> 02:48.569
Smashed by the wars.

02:50.369 --> 02:54.049
Now I am the keeper of his body...

02:54.609 --> 02:58.369
...embalmed here, in the Egyptian ways.

02:58.529 --> 03:02.409
I followed him as Pharaoh
and have now ruled 40 years.

03:02.569 --> 03:03.769
Hello, Papa.

03:03.929 --> 03:06.169
I am the victor...

03:06.329 --> 03:10.049
...but what does it all mean, when
there is no one left to remember...

03:10.649 --> 03:12.929
...the great cavalry charge at Gaugamela...

03:13.089 --> 03:16.409
...or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...

03:16.609 --> 03:22.249
...when we crossed
a 100,000-man army into India?

03:27.929 --> 03:31.289
He was a god, Cadmos...

03:31.489 --> 03:34.009
...or as close as anything I've ever seen.

03:34.169 --> 03:37.849
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. I laugh.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.609
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

03:40.769 --> 03:44.729
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

03:45.529 --> 03:47.809
It takes strong men to rule.

03:47.969 --> 03:54.169
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

03:54.769 --> 03:57.729
Before him, there were tribes...

03:57.889 --> 04:02.049
...and after him, all was possible.

04:02.209 --> 04:06.849
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

04:07.009 --> 04:09.409
...and be better for all.

04:09.729 --> 04:12.329
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built.

04:12.489 --> 04:17.529
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

04:17.689 --> 04:20.649
A Hellenic civilization...

04:20.809 --> 04:24.849
...open to all.

04:27.889 --> 04:31.489
But how can I say it?
How can I tell you what it was like...

04:31.649 --> 04:36.009
...to be young, to dream big dreams?

04:36.169 --> 04:40.849
To believe when Alexander looked you
in the eye, you could do anything.

04:41.009 --> 04:42.809
Anything.

04:44.609 --> 04:50.849
In his presence, by the light of Apollo,
we were better than ourselves.

04:52.889 --> 04:54.249
Truly...

04:54.849 --> 05:01.049
...I've known many great men
in my life, but only one colossus.

05:01.249 --> 05:03.969
And only now, when old,
do I understand...

05:04.129 --> 05:08.449
...who this force of nature really was.

05:12.529 --> 05:13.849
Or do I?

05:15.169 --> 05:19.449
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

05:19.649 --> 05:22.809
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

05:23.009 --> 05:27.609
Men, all men, reach and fall...

05:28.409 --> 05:30.889
...reach and fall.

05:35.849 --> 05:42.089
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

05:43.169 --> 05:46.329
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

05:46.489 --> 05:51.649
...Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

05:52.249 --> 05:56.209
For 100 years now, the Persian kings
had bribed the Greeks...

05:56.369 --> 05:59.489
...with their gold to fight as mercenaries.

06:00.009 --> 06:04.809
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

06:04.969 --> 06:09.569
...uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

06:09.729 --> 06:13.729
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

06:13.889 --> 06:17.529
...that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

06:18.529 --> 06:20.929
He then turned his eye on Persia...

06:21.409 --> 06:25.009
...where it was said
the new Great King Darius himself...

06:25.169 --> 06:29.249
...on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.

06:33.689 --> 06:39.609
It was from these loins of war
that Alexander was born, in Pella.

06:49.569 --> 06:53.849
Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...

06:54.049 --> 07:00.249
...and said that Alexander was the
child of Dionysus. Others, Zeus.

07:02.209 --> 07:06.329
But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...

07:06.529 --> 07:11.089
...at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.

07:11.249 --> 07:17.489
Fortune follows bold ones

07:18.889 --> 07:25.129
Trust the ones who give you love

07:25.609 --> 07:31.769
Life has just begun, son

07:31.929 --> 07:35.489
Her skin is water.

07:35.649 --> 07:37.849
Her tongue is fire.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.329
She is your friend.

07:43.889 --> 07:46.089
Take it.

07:48.689 --> 07:54.849
If you hesitate, she will strike.
Remember that.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.849
Never hesitate.

08:00.849 --> 08:02.889
Yes.

08:04.369 --> 08:06.809
They are like people.

08:07.889 --> 08:14.129
You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...

08:14.769 --> 08:19.209
...but still, they can turn on you.

08:26.369 --> 08:28.769
Don't hurt her.

08:30.169 --> 08:31.889
Good.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.609
Come.

08:41.609 --> 08:43.489
He calls me a barbarian.

08:43.649 --> 08:47.329
Philip makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

09:11.289 --> 09:17.289
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

09:48.609 --> 09:51.009
My little Achilles.

10:11.489 --> 10:14.489
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

10:15.969 --> 10:17.849
What is it you want?

10:18.009 --> 10:19.769
Six months. Did you miss me?

10:19.969 --> 10:23.449
- No. Not here!
- Proud bitch. I'm still your king.

10:23.649 --> 10:26.529
King of what? Sheepherders?

10:31.289 --> 10:36.009
- I am of Achilles' royal blood.
- The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.009
- You are nothing but a drunken whore.
- Shut your mouth.

10:39.169 --> 10:40.889
You 10-titted bitch from Hades!

10:41.049 --> 10:44.409
Which god could I curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

10:44.569 --> 10:47.289
Do you think people respect you?

10:47.449 --> 10:50.209
You think they don't know your bastards?

10:58.209 --> 11:01.609
Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!

11:01.769 --> 11:04.609
I told you not!
I told you not.

11:04.769 --> 11:07.329
- You'll obey me.
- I will not.

11:07.489 --> 11:11.649
You'll obey me, or I'll kill you
with my own hands.

11:14.249 --> 11:18.089
No! No! Stop! Papa!

11:20.009 --> 11:23.369
- Obey me!
- Your Majesty! No!

11:25.049 --> 11:26.809
In the name of the gods.

11:26.969 --> 11:31.929
He will never be yours! Never!

11:32.129 --> 11:36.569
In my womb, I carried my avenger!

11:45.569 --> 11:48.769
In the world he grew up to...

11:48.929 --> 11:53.689
...I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.

11:53.849 --> 11:57.129
You don't need much to fight.

11:57.289 --> 12:03.449
When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...

12:03.649 --> 12:07.529
...courage won't be in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.

12:07.689 --> 12:11.489
It's in the heart of a man.

12:11.649 --> 12:15.769
You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.

12:15.929 --> 12:18.209
You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...

12:18.369 --> 12:22.409
...when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.

12:22.569 --> 12:27.449
Come on, Alexander. Come on.

12:27.649 --> 12:30.409
Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?

12:30.569 --> 12:36.489
The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.

12:39.849 --> 12:41.409
Good. That's it.

12:41.569 --> 12:45.929
Well done, Hephaistion. Good wrestling.
That's what I want.

12:46.089 --> 12:47.569
Come, come, come.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.449
You did well, but you lost.

12:49.609 --> 12:54.889
Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.

12:55.049 --> 12:57.689
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

12:59.649 --> 13:01.809
You're right.

13:01.969 --> 13:04.889
But I promise you, I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

13:07.969 --> 13:11.849
It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...

13:12.009 --> 13:15.329
...except by Hephaistion's thighs.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.969
Although an inferior race...

13:19.169 --> 13:23.689
...the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

13:23.849 --> 13:28.889
But is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...

13:29.089 --> 13:32.569
...could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

13:32.769 --> 13:38.569
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

13:38.729 --> 13:43.209
...by this river east, down
into the great plains of India...

13:43.369 --> 13:47.769
...out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

13:47.969 --> 13:51.689
...and by this route up the Nile...

13:51.849 --> 13:57.689
...back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

13:58.369 --> 14:01.089
Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...

14:01.249 --> 14:04.209
...and act on their favored position
at the center...

14:04.369 --> 14:06.209
...Greece could rule the world.

14:06.609 --> 14:11.849
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

14:13.289 --> 14:18.049
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

14:18.209 --> 14:23.249
All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

14:23.649 --> 14:27.289
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

14:27.489 --> 14:29.969
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

14:30.129 --> 14:33.769
Tales of Amazons? No, Alexander.

14:33.929 --> 14:37.529
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

14:37.729 --> 14:42.169
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

14:43.649 --> 14:48.249
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

14:48.449 --> 14:53.569
It is... It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

14:54.609 --> 14:59.529
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

15:01.209 --> 15:02.729
Master?

15:02.889 --> 15:04.089
- Master?
- Yes?

15:04.249 --> 15:05.529
- Master!
- Out with it!

15:05.689 --> 15:08.489
- Why are the Persians so cruel?
- Oh, come on, Nearchus.

15:08.649 --> 15:10.809
That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.

15:11.009 --> 15:15.449
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

15:15.609 --> 15:18.329
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

15:18.489 --> 15:22.169
Excess in all things is the undoing of men.

15:22.329 --> 15:24.809
That is why we Greeks are superior.

15:24.969 --> 15:27.449
We practice control of our senses.

15:27.609 --> 15:29.849
Moderation, we hope.

15:30.049 --> 15:32.329
And what of Achilles at Troy, master?

15:32.489 --> 15:37.249
- Was he not excessive?
- Achilles simply lacks restraint.

15:37.409 --> 15:41.209
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

15:41.409 --> 15:44.489
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

15:44.649 --> 15:49.369
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

15:49.529 --> 15:53.249
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

15:54.369 --> 15:57.729
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

15:57.889 --> 16:01.569
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

16:01.729 --> 16:06.009
Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.

16:06.529 --> 16:11.329
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

16:11.489 --> 16:14.969
...that is pure and excellent.

16:15.129 --> 16:19.129
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

16:19.289 --> 16:23.049
...this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

16:23.209 --> 16:25.609
...and lift us from our frog pond.

16:30.369 --> 16:34.689
Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.

16:34.849 --> 16:39.129
And growing more ambitious, he now
planned the invasion of Persia.

16:45.209 --> 16:49.289
The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, I'll ride him myself.

16:49.449 --> 16:51.729
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.

16:52.289 --> 16:53.809
Not with your leg.

16:55.089 --> 16:56.729
He's been beaten far too often.

16:58.009 --> 17:00.449
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

17:00.609 --> 17:04.249
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

17:04.449 --> 17:06.489
For three and a half talents...

17:06.689 --> 17:09.209
...I couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you...

17:09.409 --> 17:12.049
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

17:14.089 --> 17:15.489
Do I seem so old?

17:21.569 --> 17:24.689
- Stay down, stay down.
- Hold him!

17:38.369 --> 17:42.489
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

17:42.649 --> 17:45.889
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

17:50.329 --> 17:51.649
And if you don't?

17:51.809 --> 17:55.289
- I'll pay for him myself.
- With what, your singing voice?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.129
I'll pay you!

17:57.289 --> 18:00.609
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

18:03.369 --> 18:06.249
He can be ridden. By me.

18:06.409 --> 18:09.049
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

18:09.249 --> 18:11.129
...at half the price.

18:11.289 --> 18:13.449
That horse will kill him, Philip.

18:13.609 --> 18:15.649
- He'll break the boy in two.
- Will he?

18:15.809 --> 18:18.489
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

18:28.569 --> 18:31.609
The boy doesn't have the craft.
He could hurt himself.

18:31.769 --> 18:35.449
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

18:41.529 --> 18:44.489
You don't like your shadow, do you?

18:44.649 --> 18:48.449
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

18:48.609 --> 18:52.329
Do you see? That's us.

18:53.249 --> 18:56.049
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

18:56.209 --> 19:00.489
He's the god of the sun.

19:03.649 --> 19:07.729
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

19:29.889 --> 19:31.689
Bucephalus.

19:31.849 --> 19:35.649
That's what I'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

19:38.329 --> 19:41.289
Bucephalus and Alexander.

19:42.649 --> 19:46.209
Come now, let's ride together.

20:17.689 --> 20:19.369
He's got some Titan in him yet.

20:19.529 --> 20:23.969
Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!

20:28.809 --> 20:31.969
Now, Bucephalus, show them.

21:03.569 --> 21:04.849
My son.

21:05.009 --> 21:06.609
My son!

21:18.209 --> 21:20.249
You remember Achilles.

21:20.449 --> 21:22.849
- He's my favorite.
- Why?

21:23.489 --> 21:26.689
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

21:26.849 --> 21:28.609
And his fate?

21:28.769 --> 21:31.889
That he must die young
but with great glory.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.649
Did he have a choice?

21:33.809 --> 21:38.049
Yes. He could live a long life,
but there would be no glory.

21:38.209 --> 21:42.249
You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.

21:42.409 --> 21:46.529
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

21:50.849 --> 21:53.649
One day, I'll be on walls like these.

21:53.809 --> 21:59.089
Prometheus stole the secret
of fire and gave it to man.

21:59.249 --> 22:01.929
It made Zeus so angry...

22:02.089 --> 22:05.049
...he chained Prometheus to a rock
in the Great Caucasus...

22:05.209 --> 22:09.369
...and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

22:09.529 --> 22:13.849
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

22:14.049 --> 22:15.249
Miserable fate.

22:19.809 --> 22:21.209
Why?

22:22.129 --> 22:24.889
Who knows these things?

22:25.049 --> 22:26.969
Anyway...

22:30.249 --> 22:36.489
Oedipus tore out his eyes when he
found out he'd murdered his father...

22:37.329 --> 22:42.489
...and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

22:42.649 --> 22:46.449
Medea, she slaughtered
her two children in vengeance...

22:46.609 --> 22:49.329
...when Jason left her for a younger wife.

22:59.009 --> 23:01.649
My mother would never hurt me.

23:02.529 --> 23:05.369
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

23:05.929 --> 23:12.169
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

23:16.449 --> 23:21.369
Herakles. Even after he accomplished
his 12 labors...

23:21.529 --> 23:26.009
...he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

23:27.289 --> 23:28.849
Poor Herakles.

23:29.769 --> 23:30.969
Great Herakles.

23:33.249 --> 23:35.449
All greatness comes from loss.

23:35.609 --> 23:41.529
Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.

23:41.729 --> 23:43.489
When I'm king like you, Father?

23:43.649 --> 23:47.289
Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.

23:48.409 --> 23:52.289
My father threw me into battle
before I knew how to fight.

23:52.449 --> 23:54.929
When I killed my first man, he said:

23:55.089 --> 23:57.209
"Now you know."

23:57.849 --> 24:01.689
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

24:01.889 --> 24:04.089
A king isn't born, Alexander.

24:04.289 --> 24:08.169
He's made by steel and by suffering.

24:09.089 --> 24:13.169
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

24:16.809 --> 24:19.129
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

24:20.129 --> 24:23.609
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

24:24.649 --> 24:30.049
No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.

24:30.209 --> 24:36.449
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

24:37.049 --> 24:40.889
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

24:41.889 --> 24:45.249
They make of us slaves.

25:10.049 --> 25:14.089
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

25:14.489 --> 25:18.409
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

25:18.569 --> 25:21.249
...and when her first son is born...

25:21.409 --> 25:26.529
...her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

25:26.689 --> 25:29.089
...with himself as regent.

25:29.249 --> 25:31.129
And you...

25:31.329 --> 25:35.169
...you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

25:35.329 --> 25:37.809
...against some monstrous Northern tribe...

25:37.969 --> 25:43.209
...to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

25:43.369 --> 25:47.089
And I, no longer queen,
will be put to death...

25:47.249 --> 25:51.129
...with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

25:51.329 --> 25:55.849
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

25:56.009 --> 26:00.569
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

26:02.049 --> 26:04.369
The only way is to strike.

26:04.529 --> 26:07.169
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

26:07.689 --> 26:11.849
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

26:12.009 --> 26:15.289
...and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.449
There is still Kynnane.

26:19.169 --> 26:22.889
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

26:23.049 --> 26:25.769
Say nothing more of my father.

26:25.929 --> 26:28.769
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

26:29.609 --> 26:31.249
You're right.

26:32.169 --> 26:34.169
Forgive me.

26:34.369 --> 26:37.049
A mother loves too much.

26:43.009 --> 26:45.529
Who shall I sing to sleep
at night anymore?

26:50.489 --> 26:55.249
I wish... I wish we could spend
more time together.

26:55.969 --> 27:00.209
Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.

27:05.369 --> 27:07.329
There's never been time, Mother.

27:08.129 --> 27:12.889
Since I was a child, I've been groomed
to be ever the best.

27:13.849 --> 27:18.129
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

27:18.289 --> 27:20.649
...cursed by your greatness.

27:25.089 --> 27:27.009
Take my strength.

27:32.449 --> 27:38.689
You must never confuse your feelings
with your duties, Alexander.

27:40.129 --> 27:44.489
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

27:44.649 --> 27:47.969
I know, but you will be 19 this summer...

27:48.129 --> 27:52.609
...and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.

27:52.769 --> 27:56.089
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

27:56.249 --> 28:00.249
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

28:00.449 --> 28:06.369
Hephaistion loves me,
as I am...

28:06.529 --> 28:07.849
...not who.

28:09.249 --> 28:12.609
Loves? Loves?

28:14.529 --> 28:17.009
In the name of Dionysus...

28:18.289 --> 28:23.769
...understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

28:23.969 --> 28:27.849
Your life hangs in the balance.

28:28.009 --> 28:32.769
- His spies are inside your closest circle.
- Stop!

28:34.929 --> 28:37.689
I'm his only worthy son.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.649
You crazed woman.

28:40.729 --> 28:42.649
He'd never hurt me.

28:43.769 --> 28:48.289
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

28:48.449 --> 28:51.729
Yes, and you would be 40.

28:51.889 --> 28:58.049
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

28:58.209 --> 29:04.289
Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.

29:04.849 --> 29:07.769
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

29:08.809 --> 29:10.329
Never.

29:26.809 --> 29:29.929
Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.

29:30.089 --> 29:32.409
If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.

29:35.449 --> 29:39.729
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

29:40.329 --> 29:43.049
...and that's the taste of a new woman.

29:43.209 --> 29:48.049
You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.

29:48.209 --> 29:50.809
Pausanias, you bore me.
Be gone with you.

29:51.009 --> 29:53.049
Alexander, I found you the right girl.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.649
- What's your name, darling?
- Antigone.

29:55.809 --> 29:57.729
- What's your name?
- Antigone.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.649
I love you, my little imp.

30:02.689 --> 30:04.449
And I love you, Cleitus.

30:05.529 --> 30:07.049
- Please, no!
- There you go.

30:08.609 --> 30:10.809
Would you prefer a seat, Cleitus?

30:11.009 --> 30:12.809
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

30:12.969 --> 30:16.209
While alive, I prefer dancing.

30:16.369 --> 30:17.809
Pausanias.

30:18.689 --> 30:20.249
Who's your new friend?

30:20.409 --> 30:22.969
- There's your new friend.
- Please don't!

30:25.089 --> 30:26.529
A toast.

30:26.689 --> 30:27.929
A toast!

30:28.649 --> 30:33.889
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

30:34.049 --> 30:39.729
...Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!

30:42.089 --> 30:48.329
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

30:48.489 --> 30:51.329
Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!

30:52.769 --> 30:58.489
And last, I drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

30:58.689 --> 31:01.569
...a Macedonian queen we can be proud of!

31:04.449 --> 31:07.609
To Philip and Eurydice...

31:07.809 --> 31:10.809
...and to their legitimate sons!

31:12.289 --> 31:14.009
Alexander, don't!

31:14.209 --> 31:17.049
What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.

31:28.609 --> 31:31.569
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

31:31.729 --> 31:33.569
Shut up, all of you!

31:34.009 --> 31:36.449
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

31:36.609 --> 31:38.529
Insolent pup.

31:38.689 --> 31:41.809
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

31:41.969 --> 31:45.209
You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.

31:45.409 --> 31:48.449
- And I dishonor you?
- You listen like your mother.

31:48.609 --> 31:50.729
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

31:50.889 --> 31:53.409
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

31:53.569 --> 31:56.649
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

31:56.809 --> 31:59.689
- You insult me!
- I insult you!

31:59.849 --> 32:02.809
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

32:03.009 --> 32:05.769
- You dog, questioning your queen.
- Shame?

32:05.929 --> 32:09.609
I've nothing to be ashamed of,
you arrogant brat.

32:09.769 --> 32:13.449
I'll marry the girl if I want,
and I'll have as many sons as I want.

32:13.609 --> 32:16.049
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

32:16.209 --> 32:18.049
Why, drunken man, must you think...

32:18.209 --> 32:20.609
...everything I do and say
comes from my mother?

32:20.769 --> 32:23.609
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

32:23.769 --> 32:25.849
...and I see her in your eyes.

32:26.049 --> 32:28.369
You covet this throne too much.

32:29.729 --> 32:34.809
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

32:35.009 --> 32:37.209
Well, you can both dream, boy.

32:37.369 --> 32:40.369
Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. It'll wait.

32:40.529 --> 32:42.009
Now!

32:43.169 --> 32:44.969
I command you.

32:45.929 --> 32:49.089
Apologize to your kinsman.

32:56.449 --> 32:58.089
Apologize.

32:58.249 --> 33:00.729
No kinsman to me.

33:04.129 --> 33:06.009
Good night, old man.

33:07.409 --> 33:11.689
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

33:12.249 --> 33:14.089
You bastard!

33:19.169 --> 33:21.249
You'll obey me. Come here.

33:39.849 --> 33:43.329
And this is the man who is going
to take you from Greece to Persia?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.929
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

33:46.089 --> 33:50.009
Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!

33:50.609 --> 33:53.889
Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.

33:54.809 --> 33:56.889
You're no son of mine!

34:03.329 --> 34:05.769
Everything suddenly changed for him.

34:08.208 --> 34:11.969
His father, King Philip, was murdered.

34:12.649 --> 34:15.129
And Alexander, at 20...

34:16.248 --> 34:20.049
...became the new ruler of Macedonia.

34:20.248 --> 34:25.289
And breaking their treaties with us,
dismissing Alexander as an untried boy...

34:25.449 --> 34:29.609
...several Greek city-states
rose up in revolt...

34:29.768 --> 34:35.129
...much to Persia's delight
and perhaps sponsored by their gold.

34:39.889 --> 34:42.248
Truly, Alexander could love like no other.

34:42.409 --> 34:46.969
But to betray him was to rouse
a vast and frightening anger.

34:47.129 --> 34:50.929
And he massacred several thousand
men of that tragic city, Thebes...

34:51.089 --> 34:54.289
...and sold the survivors into slavery.

34:54.889 --> 34:58.529
This, as intended,
stunned and defeated the Greeks.

34:58.689 --> 35:03.329
And though, in the end, he treated
most populations with magnanimity...

35:03.489 --> 35:05.369
...it is these exceptions...

35:05.529 --> 35:10.969
...Thebes, Gaza in Syria and, later,
Persepolis in Persia and others...

35:11.129 --> 35:16.369
...that are always remembered by those
who hate Alexander and all he stood for.

35:17.049 --> 35:23.209
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia
with an army of 40,000 trained men.

35:23.369 --> 35:26.649
And liberating one city-state
after the other...

35:26.809 --> 35:30.649
...he conquered all of western Asia
south to Egypt...

35:30.849 --> 35:36.529
...where he was declared Pharaoh
of Egypt, worshipped as a god.

35:38.009 --> 35:43.849
It was in Egypt that the
respected oracle at Siwah...

35:44.009 --> 35:46.529
...declared him the...

35:46.689 --> 35:50.009
...true son of Zeus.

35:51.969 --> 35:55.129
He finally provoked
Darius himself to battle...

35:55.289 --> 35:59.329
...in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

36:04.849 --> 36:06.329
It was mad.

36:06.529 --> 36:12.009
Forty thousand of us
against 250,000 barbarians.

36:13.049 --> 36:18.729
It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.

36:21.929 --> 36:25.529
Alexander, son of a god.

36:26.169 --> 36:28.089
It was a myth, of course.

36:28.289 --> 36:31.049
At least it started as a myth.

36:31.209 --> 36:33.249
I know.

36:33.409 --> 36:35.609
I was there.

36:35.809 --> 36:37.049
I saw his eyes.

36:37.249 --> 36:39.009
There.

36:39.169 --> 36:43.049
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

36:43.809 --> 36:44.969
Kill Darius?

36:45.129 --> 36:48.169
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

36:49.089 --> 36:51.289
If I die, it's one Macedonian.

36:51.489 --> 36:55.049
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

36:55.209 --> 36:56.689
Here.

36:56.849 --> 36:59.409
Right here, we cut the throat
of the Persian Army.

36:59.569 --> 37:02.729
This is madness. You'll never get
within 100 paces of him.

37:02.889 --> 37:04.969
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

37:05.129 --> 37:09.249
Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...

37:09.409 --> 37:13.689
...with your son Philotas,
for just one, two hours tomorrow.

37:14.969 --> 37:19.609
And you, unbreakable Antigonus,
the center phalanx.

37:19.809 --> 37:21.529
Perdiccas.

37:21.729 --> 37:23.769
Leonnatus.

37:23.929 --> 37:25.769
Nearchus.

37:26.209 --> 37:27.649
Polyperchon.

37:27.809 --> 37:31.769
If you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas here, in the center...

37:31.969 --> 37:34.809
...their cavalry will follow me
out to the right.

37:34.969 --> 37:37.209
And when bold Cassander breaks...

37:37.409 --> 37:40.249
...stretching their left, a hole will open.

37:40.449 --> 37:41.969
Then I and my cavalry...

37:42.129 --> 37:47.769
...our revered Cleitus,
Ptolemy and Hephaistion...

37:47.929 --> 37:49.849
...will strike through that gap...

37:50.609 --> 37:53.209
...and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

37:53.369 --> 37:57.009
Alexander, even with luck, timing,
the gods, we must rout them tomorrow.

37:57.169 --> 37:58.809
Destroy their army completely.

37:59.009 --> 38:02.409
Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home.

38:02.569 --> 38:04.609
Right.

38:04.769 --> 38:07.009
You speak of home.

38:07.169 --> 38:09.129
And retreat.

38:09.289 --> 38:12.889
But do you understand, Parmenion...

38:13.049 --> 38:15.529
...Babylon's my new home?

38:17.849 --> 38:19.449
Alexander...

38:19.609 --> 38:21.609
...if we must fight...

38:21.769 --> 38:23.129
...do so with stealth.

38:23.329 --> 38:28.089
Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.

38:29.689 --> 38:33.249
I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.

38:33.409 --> 38:36.409
No, you are too honorable for that.

38:36.609 --> 38:41.609
No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.

38:41.769 --> 38:45.169
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

38:46.009 --> 38:48.169
The lands west
of the Euphrates, Alexander...

38:48.329 --> 38:52.489
...the hand of his daughter in marriage.
When has a Greek been given such honors?

38:52.649 --> 38:56.449
These are not honors.
Parmenion, they're bribes...

38:56.609 --> 38:59.809
...which the Greeks
have accepted too long.

39:00.609 --> 39:04.049
Do you forget the man who murdered
my father lies across the valley?

39:04.209 --> 39:08.889
Alexander, we're still not sure if it was
Persian gold behind the assassination.

39:09.089 --> 39:12.969
- That is no matter!
- Parmenion, you know that's not true.

39:13.809 --> 39:17.609
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.

39:17.769 --> 39:20.569
Now I urge you, regroup.

39:20.729 --> 39:23.729
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

39:23.889 --> 39:28.009
I would, if I were Parmenion.

39:28.529 --> 39:30.569
But I am Alexander.

39:30.729 --> 39:34.569
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

39:35.169 --> 39:36.649
These are my terms.

39:36.809 --> 39:41.209
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

39:41.929 --> 39:44.569
...then he'll come to me tomorrow.

39:45.489 --> 39:50.169
And when he bows down to Greece...

39:50.329 --> 39:52.969
...Alexander will be merciful.

39:57.409 --> 40:01.049
By Ares' chains, he's got balls, men.

40:01.209 --> 40:03.929
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

40:05.409 --> 40:09.529
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

40:20.809 --> 40:23.409
To whom do you pray?

40:26.769 --> 40:28.729
Phobos.

40:30.409 --> 40:32.449
Fear?

40:35.209 --> 40:37.089
A bad omen.

40:38.929 --> 40:41.329
More so for Darius.

40:46.609 --> 40:52.049
I've come to believe that fear
of death drives all men, Hephaistion.

40:52.209 --> 40:55.129
This we didn't learn as schoolboys.

40:55.289 --> 40:59.129
It is the cause of all our misfortunes.

40:59.289 --> 41:02.689
- So, mighty Crateros.
- Your Majesty.

41:04.329 --> 41:07.609
- Are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?
- It's been too long coming.

41:07.769 --> 41:11.649
- The men are skittish as colts.
- Good.

41:11.809 --> 41:14.049
Fear makes men fight better.

41:14.729 --> 41:17.089
Post your sentries alertly
but rest them well.

41:17.249 --> 41:21.329
Don't worry, general. I'm known to sleep
with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

41:21.489 --> 41:25.089
Only because someone
might steal his loot, sire.

41:26.009 --> 41:28.969
After tomorrow, even the thrifty
among you shall be kings.

41:29.129 --> 41:33.889
The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
You'll stain the ground with Persian blood.

41:34.409 --> 41:37.049
I've always believed, Alexander.

41:37.209 --> 41:41.049
But this seems so much bigger than us.

41:41.209 --> 41:45.489
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when
they stood side by side at the siege of Troy?

41:45.649 --> 41:48.489
Patroclus died first.

41:48.689 --> 41:50.249
If you do...

41:51.129 --> 41:55.369
If you were to fall, Hephaistion,
even if Macedonia were to lose a king...

41:55.529 --> 41:58.129
...I will avenge you...

41:58.289 --> 42:00.969
...and follow you down
to the house of death.

42:01.129 --> 42:03.569
I would do the same.

42:12.689 --> 42:17.209
On the eve of battle,
it's hardest to be alone.

42:21.209 --> 42:23.209
Then perhaps...

42:24.729 --> 42:27.969
Perhaps this is farewell...

42:28.529 --> 42:30.769
...my Alexander.

42:30.929 --> 42:33.569
Fear not, Hephaistion.

42:34.649 --> 42:37.049
We are at the beginning.

43:09.449 --> 43:13.409
Blood makes the world rise.

43:14.489 --> 43:17.849
Blood makes the rain fall.

43:20.569 --> 43:24.289
Blood makes the earth grow.

43:25.209 --> 43:31.449
And in blood, all men are born and die.

43:33.129 --> 43:38.609
Blood is the food of the gods below.

43:52.089 --> 43:55.609
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.

43:58.289 --> 44:02.129
Company, group! Regroup!

44:13.009 --> 44:15.929
Phalanx, turn right!

44:32.289 --> 44:36.809
Phalanx, attention!

44:57.289 --> 44:59.849
Neoptolemus.

45:00.009 --> 45:02.969
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tire.

45:03.129 --> 45:06.289
You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?

45:11.449 --> 45:14.089
Dexippos, by Athena.

45:14.249 --> 45:18.249
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

45:18.409 --> 45:20.929
Will you match it with your spear?

45:25.249 --> 45:30.409
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

45:30.569 --> 45:35.089
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

45:35.249 --> 45:38.689
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

45:38.889 --> 45:41.689
You fight for them today.

45:43.049 --> 45:48.889
You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.

45:49.049 --> 45:53.609
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

45:53.929 --> 46:00.129
...where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army...

46:27.969 --> 46:33.009
But ask yourselves, who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

46:33.169 --> 46:35.609
...to murder my father, our king...

46:35.769 --> 46:40.409
...in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

46:40.569 --> 46:45.609
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

46:45.769 --> 46:50.049
Who is this king but a king of air?

46:50.249 --> 46:53.329
These men do not fight for their homes.

46:53.489 --> 46:56.849
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

46:57.449 --> 47:00.809
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

47:00.969 --> 47:03.929
...because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

47:04.969 --> 47:08.169
But we are not here today as slaves.

47:08.329 --> 47:10.369
We are here today...

47:10.529 --> 47:14.129
...as Macedonian freemen!

47:28.089 --> 47:29.849
Some of you...

47:31.449 --> 47:33.769
...perhaps myself...

47:33.929 --> 47:38.569
...will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

47:39.449 --> 47:41.449
But I say to you...

47:41.609 --> 47:45.369
...what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.849
Conquer your fear...

47:48.009 --> 47:51.329
...and I promise you,
you will conquer death.

48:13.409 --> 48:16.969
When they ask why you fought
so bravely, you will answer:

48:17.129 --> 48:19.929
"I was here this day at Gaugamela...

48:21.969 --> 48:24.289
...for the freedom...

48:25.369 --> 48:28.329
...and glory...

48:30.289 --> 48:32.569
...of Greece!"

48:38.849 --> 48:41.409
Zeus be with us!

49:07.249 --> 49:10.689
Cassander! Four columns, go!

49:15.889 --> 49:17.809
Where does he go?

49:17.969 --> 49:20.209
I don't know, Majesty.

49:20.369 --> 49:23.169
Envelop him, Bessus.

49:26.689 --> 49:29.649
Hephaistion, go!

49:38.849 --> 49:40.449
Phalanx!

49:58.129 --> 50:01.329
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

50:04.329 --> 50:05.849
Yes, great king.

51:05.449 --> 51:07.889
Be brave, men.

51:09.249 --> 51:10.769
Steady on the left, lads!

51:11.249 --> 51:13.529
Bend if you must, but never break.

51:14.809 --> 51:16.769
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

51:45.609 --> 51:47.649
Pick up the pace!

51:57.049 --> 52:00.609
Prepare to repel chariots!

53:22.409 --> 53:24.409
Cassander!

53:24.569 --> 53:26.809
Forward, men!

53:37.129 --> 53:41.249
- Left turn!
- Infantry, clear! Out now!

54:27.529 --> 54:29.129
Hold your positions!

54:29.289 --> 54:32.009
Hold your positions!

54:48.769 --> 54:50.769
We must fall back to the gully, Father.

54:50.929 --> 54:52.369
No, hold.

54:52.529 --> 54:56.289
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

54:56.449 --> 54:58.729
- Move!
- Yes, sir.

55:16.529 --> 55:19.929
Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

55:24.569 --> 55:28.689
- Shields, break off!
- Break off.

55:28.849 --> 55:31.089
The shields are here!

55:32.169 --> 55:34.449
Drive for the hole!

55:34.929 --> 55:37.889
- Drive for the hole!
- Drive for the hole!

56:19.249 --> 56:22.489
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

56:24.449 --> 56:27.329
- Philotas! Philotas!
- Father.

56:27.489 --> 56:29.449
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

56:29.609 --> 56:35.329
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

56:51.329 --> 56:55.729
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!

57:35.689 --> 57:38.209
Darius!

57:38.409 --> 57:40.369
Find your horses.

57:55.529 --> 57:57.849
Darius!

58:17.769 --> 58:20.529
Go! Go!

58:35.249 --> 58:39.609
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

58:39.769 --> 58:42.689
Provision the horses.

58:42.849 --> 58:46.649
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

58:46.809 --> 58:49.729
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

58:49.889 --> 58:51.929
Parmenion's crumbling.

58:52.089 --> 58:56.369
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

58:56.529 --> 58:59.849
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

59:08.449 --> 59:11.009
You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...

59:11.169 --> 59:14.049
...but you'll never run far enough!

59:14.209 --> 59:16.809
To Parmenion!

59:36.369 --> 59:37.889
You bleed free, my lord.

59:38.049 --> 59:41.289
- May I tend to your wound?
- No, Hermolaus, not now.

59:41.449 --> 59:43.569
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

59:43.729 --> 59:45.449
Help them.

01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:15.049
- Your Majesty.
- You're very brave.

01:00:16.009 --> 01:00:17.769
What shall I call you?

01:00:17.929 --> 01:00:20.649
- Glaukos, my king.
- Glaukos.

01:00:21.649 --> 01:00:25.409
- And where's your home?
- Illyria.

01:00:26.449 --> 01:00:28.969
Let your body go loose.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.289
Think of home now.

01:00:32.489 --> 01:00:34.849
Be brave again, Glaukos...

01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:38.649
...and you will live on in glory.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:41.529
Alexander.

01:00:50.889 --> 01:00:54.969
The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...

01:00:55.129 --> 01:00:57.249
...was destroyed.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:10.089
And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:23.489
Alexander once said to me:

01:01:23.689 --> 01:01:28.329
"We are most alone
when we are with the myths."

01:01:29.129 --> 01:01:30.849
Phalanx!

01:01:36.569 --> 01:01:38.929
And thus, it came to pass in a dream...

01:01:39.089 --> 01:01:42.889
...as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.

01:01:43.049 --> 01:01:46.129
At this one glorious moment in time...

01:01:46.289 --> 01:01:50.329
...Alexander was loved by all.

01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:57.009
But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...

01:01:57.169 --> 01:01:59.849
...than she was to leave.

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:52.249
Sikander! Sikander!

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:23.169
Imagine the minds that conceived this.
With architects and engineers like these...

01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:25.649
...we could build cities
as we've only dreamed.

01:03:25.809 --> 01:03:30.409
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

01:03:30.569 --> 01:03:35.969
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

01:03:36.169 --> 01:03:38.649
And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.

01:03:39.089 --> 01:03:42.289
Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.

01:03:44.689 --> 01:03:47.889
Not for the men who fought, I trust.

01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:52.049
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

01:03:52.209 --> 01:03:53.809
Now you sound like Philip.

01:03:54.809 --> 01:03:56.529
Philip never saw Babylon.

01:03:57.169 --> 01:03:59.089
No, he didn't, Hephaistion.

01:04:00.689 --> 01:04:02.769
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:06.329
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

01:04:06.489 --> 01:04:08.929
...but whatever our differences,
know this day...

01:04:09.089 --> 01:04:12.449
...your father would be very proud of you.

01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:15.809
Thank you, Parmenion.

01:04:16.569 --> 01:04:20.929
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

01:04:21.129 --> 01:04:23.209
They, too, blind me.

01:04:27.769 --> 01:04:31.289
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders...

01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:34.329
...we now rule 2 million square miles.

01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:37.809
Not if you keep giving it all away.

01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:43.769
None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.

01:04:44.169 --> 01:04:45.889
You overvalue us.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.569
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

01:04:49.729 --> 01:04:51.969
...and I but the king of air.

01:04:52.129 --> 01:04:56.969
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

01:04:57.129 --> 01:05:00.409
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

01:05:00.569 --> 01:05:03.769
Only when he's found will it be decided.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:07.449
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:10.409
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

01:05:10.569 --> 01:05:12.329
We must hunt Darius down to.

01:05:12.489 --> 01:05:15.809
- That was not your father's mission.
- And I am not my father.

01:05:18.369 --> 01:05:20.809
Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?

01:05:20.969 --> 01:05:22.569
Fortune favors the bold.

01:05:26.369 --> 01:05:27.729
By the gods, what is this?

01:05:27.889 --> 01:05:30.769
No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.

01:05:30.929 --> 01:05:34.369
I venture one for every night of the year.

01:05:59.329 --> 01:06:01.449
Help me, Aphrodite.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.889
How will I go back to Lysimache
after this?

01:06:04.049 --> 01:06:08.809
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.

01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:10.569
Apologies.

01:06:48.969 --> 01:06:51.129
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

01:06:52.489 --> 01:06:56.769
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:16.529
Great King Alexander.

01:07:19.129 --> 01:07:21.249
The princess of the thousand roses...

01:07:21.409 --> 01:07:24.489
...and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:27.609
...Stateira.

01:07:28.249 --> 01:07:29.849
Noble Alexander...

01:07:36.649 --> 01:07:39.569
...I come to beg for the lives...

01:07:40.009 --> 01:07:41.529
...of my sisters...

01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:45.289
...my mother, my grandmother.

01:07:49.729 --> 01:07:53.649
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:55.849
He, too, is Alexander.

01:07:59.529 --> 01:08:00.689
Please.

01:08:01.689 --> 01:08:05.129
I plead for my family's lives.

01:08:06.409 --> 01:08:09.409
- Sell me as a slave, great king, but...
- Look now...

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:11.609
...in my eyes...

01:08:12.769 --> 01:08:13.929
...princess...

01:08:15.889 --> 01:08:17.408
...and tell me...

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.049
...how would you like to be treated?

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:24.448
As I am...

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:26.569
...a princess.

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:31.368
Then so be it.

01:08:33.049 --> 01:08:35.969
You and your family shall
be treated as my family.

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:41.569
You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.

01:08:41.929 --> 01:08:45.448
Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?

01:08:47.889 --> 01:08:49.408
No.

01:08:50.368 --> 01:08:53.328
Everything I wish...

01:08:53.488 --> 01:08:55.209
...I have...

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:58.368
Requested.

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:00.529
Requested.

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:04.488
You truly are...

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:05.929
...a queen.

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:15.209
Yes, she would be
a perfect match for you...

01:09:15.849 --> 01:09:17.649
...but you do nothing.

01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:21.249
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:25.129
...at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

01:09:25.288 --> 01:09:28.849
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:31.448
I must watch him grow stronger.

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:41.368
I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:44.448
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:46.049
They are like snakes...

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.408
...and can be turned.

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:50.129
General Crateros.

01:09:52.969 --> 01:09:56.449
Cassander is Antipater's son.

01:09:56.609 --> 01:10:00.049
Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...

01:10:00.209 --> 01:10:03.129
...and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.

01:10:03.289 --> 01:10:05.449
But beware of men who think too much.

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:08.169
They blind themselves.

01:10:11.369 --> 01:10:13.369
Only Hephaistion do I leave out.

01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:16.929
But all of them you make rich...

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:22.689
...while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous poverty.

01:10:23.449 --> 01:10:26.769
Why won't you ever believe me?

01:10:26.929 --> 01:10:32.369
It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:35.009
For they are dark, Alexander.

01:10:35.169 --> 01:10:37.449
So dark.

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.049
But in you...

01:10:39.209 --> 01:10:43.849
...the son of Zeus,
lies the light of the world.

01:10:44.009 --> 01:10:47.889
Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...

01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:52.249
...when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

01:10:52.409 --> 01:10:56.649
...shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

01:10:56.809 --> 01:11:00.169
Never will there be an Alexander like you.

01:11:00.329 --> 01:11:03.169
Alexander the Great.

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:07.329
Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.569
I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...

01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:14.849
...they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

01:11:16.329 --> 01:11:19.769
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

01:11:19.929 --> 01:11:21.849
Bring her, Alexander.

01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:25.009
- It'll give her such joy.
- Joy?

01:11:25.769 --> 01:11:28.889
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

01:11:31.449 --> 01:11:34.009
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

01:11:40.089 --> 01:11:42.009
I'll take my own bath.

01:11:42.929 --> 01:11:44.449
Thank you, Bagoas.

01:12:00.489 --> 01:12:04.329
The generals question your obsession
with Darius.

01:12:04.489 --> 01:12:07.529
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:09.169
Naturally.

01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:13.489
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

01:12:13.649 --> 01:12:16.809
I've seen it now 1000 times,
on 1000 faces.

01:12:16.969 --> 01:12:19.009
These people want...

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:22.009
Need change.

01:12:22.769 --> 01:12:25.329
Aristotle was wrong about them.

01:12:25.489 --> 01:12:27.329
How so?

01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:29.289
Look at those we've conquered.

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:31.409
They leave their dead unburied.

01:12:31.569 --> 01:12:34.409
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

01:12:34.569 --> 01:12:36.489
They mate in public.

01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:41.329
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

01:12:41.489 --> 01:12:45.929
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:49.049
They can soldier or work in the cities.

01:12:49.209 --> 01:12:53.249
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

01:12:53.729 --> 01:12:56.529
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:57.889
...and the people.

01:12:58.049 --> 01:13:03.449
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:07.129
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

01:13:07.289 --> 01:13:12.329
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

01:13:13.329 --> 01:13:16.449
To free the people of the world...

01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:21.009
...such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:23.689
...a feat to rival Prometheus...

01:13:24.489 --> 01:13:27.009
...who was always a friend to man.

01:13:27.209 --> 01:13:29.449
Remember the fates of these heroes.

01:13:29.609 --> 01:13:33.649
- They suffered greatly.
- We all suffer.

01:13:34.089 --> 01:13:37.489
Your father, mine.

01:13:38.249 --> 01:13:40.249
They all came to the end of their time.

01:13:40.409 --> 01:13:44.289
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

01:13:45.569 --> 01:13:50.169
You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men."

01:13:50.489 --> 01:13:52.449
Are there no other forces?

01:13:53.449 --> 01:13:56.289
Is there not love in your life...

01:13:57.569 --> 01:13:59.489
...Alexander?

01:14:06.089 --> 01:14:11.129
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

01:14:12.249 --> 01:14:16.289
So many years,
so many miles between you.

01:14:17.609 --> 01:14:19.489
What is it you fear?

01:14:20.969 --> 01:14:23.129
Who knows these things?

01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:29.569
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.569
Which am I, Hephaistion?

01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:36.769
Weak or divine?

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:41.289
All I know is...

01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:44.369
...I trust only you in this world.

01:14:44.529 --> 01:14:46.529
I've missed you.

01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:48.489
I need you.

01:14:50.249 --> 01:14:52.049
It is you I love, Hephaistion.

01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:56.249
No other.

01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:03.809
You still hold your head cocked.

01:15:04.969 --> 01:15:06.649
- Like that.
- I've stopped that.

01:15:06.809 --> 01:15:08.649
Like a deer, listening in the wind.

01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:11.529
You strike me still, Alexander.

01:15:12.969 --> 01:15:15.449
And you have eyes like no other.

01:15:16.809 --> 01:15:20.809
I sound as stupid as a schoolboy, but...

01:15:23.449 --> 01:15:26.249
...you're everything I care for...

01:15:26.409 --> 01:15:29.889
...and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

01:15:30.409 --> 01:15:33.409
...I'm so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.

01:15:33.609 --> 01:15:36.129
You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.

01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:39.849
I'll be with you always.

01:15:40.449 --> 01:15:42.289
Till the end.

01:15:55.129 --> 01:15:57.689
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...

01:15:57.849 --> 01:16:02.889
...turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.

01:16:05.289 --> 01:16:11.049
We chased Darius towards Bactria
but missed taking him by hours.

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:16.049
He was dying when we found him, sire.

01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:18.049
He asked for water.

01:16:18.209 --> 01:16:20.489
He drank and died.

01:16:26.889 --> 01:16:31.369
The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.

01:16:58.289 --> 01:17:00.209
Fully honoring his corpse...

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:05.489
...Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...

01:17:06.009 --> 01:17:10.649
...crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.

01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:18.849
We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...

01:17:19.529 --> 01:17:22.689
...where only legendary heroes
had once trod.

01:17:22.849 --> 01:17:28.049
The surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.

01:17:28.209 --> 01:17:31.729
In fact, we were totally lost.

01:17:32.729 --> 01:17:35.649
Here, Alexander founded
his 10th Alexandria...

01:17:35.809 --> 01:17:40.969
...and settled it with veterans, their women
and any who would dare the frontier life.

01:17:41.929 --> 01:17:44.849
Unable to accept defeat in any form...

01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:49.249
...Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted...

01:17:49.409 --> 01:17:53.169
...until the day he received the head
of his last enemy in surrender.

01:17:57.729 --> 01:18:02.169
For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...

01:18:03.289 --> 01:18:07.529
...which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.

01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:15.209
It was here that Alexander made
one of his most mysterious decisions.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:51.129
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

01:19:52.689 --> 01:19:54.009
Perhaps too much.

01:19:56.289 --> 01:19:58.689
In the ways of my country...

01:19:58.849 --> 01:20:03.369
...those who love too much
lose everything...

01:20:03.529 --> 01:20:06.489
...and those who love with irony...

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.129
...last.

01:20:21.089 --> 01:20:25.449
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this, a hill chief's daughter.

01:20:25.649 --> 01:20:27.849
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.

01:20:28.289 --> 01:20:31.569
But what's the point, Alexander?
Just take her as your concubine.

01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:34.449
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

01:20:34.609 --> 01:20:39.089
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

01:20:39.249 --> 01:20:43.089
To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive, is a sign of deep respect.

01:20:43.249 --> 01:20:45.329
It will bring us together, unify us.

01:20:45.489 --> 01:20:47.889
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

01:20:48.049 --> 01:20:52.369
- As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.
- Alexander!

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:55.369
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

01:20:55.569 --> 01:20:57.729
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

01:20:57.889 --> 01:21:01.249
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

01:21:01.449 --> 01:21:04.889
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

01:21:05.049 --> 01:21:08.809
...chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

01:21:08.969 --> 01:21:10.929
For what? To build roads in Asia?

01:21:11.089 --> 01:21:13.169
To give these people cities?

01:21:13.329 --> 01:21:16.609
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

01:21:16.769 --> 01:21:19.049
- What benefit to Macedon?
- It's far richer!

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:21.369
- Look what you give them.
- With respect...

01:21:21.529 --> 01:21:25.209
...had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling...

01:21:25.369 --> 01:21:28.569
- How dare you, Nearchus?!
- General Nearchus to you, boy.

01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:32.089
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

01:21:32.249 --> 01:21:34.489
...or any of you could've done!
- Philotas!

01:21:40.209 --> 01:21:42.729
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

01:21:43.369 --> 01:21:46.209
I supported you at your father's death.

01:21:46.409 --> 01:21:49.169
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

01:21:49.329 --> 01:21:52.209
...and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

01:21:52.369 --> 01:21:54.369
...give us a Macedonian heir.

01:21:54.529 --> 01:21:56.169
A Macedonian heir.

01:22:02.289 --> 01:22:04.209
- You've been heard clearly.
- But...

01:22:04.369 --> 01:22:09.729
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where I look to you...

01:22:09.889 --> 01:22:14.809
...and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

01:22:15.249 --> 01:22:17.289
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

01:22:17.449 --> 01:22:21.209
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:24.089
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

01:22:24.249 --> 01:22:27.609
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

01:22:27.769 --> 01:22:31.209
He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.

01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:36.289
He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.

01:22:36.449 --> 01:22:39.049
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:42.409
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

01:22:42.569 --> 01:22:43.809
Old man...

01:22:43.969 --> 01:22:46.529
...we're in new worlds.

01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:50.729
Alexander, be reasonable!

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:53.249
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

01:22:53.409 --> 01:22:55.209
Share our rewards?

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:57.409
You remember what Aristotle said.

01:22:57.569 --> 01:22:58.849
An Asian?

01:22:59.009 --> 01:23:02.609
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:04.809
- Aristotle be damned!
- Alexander!

01:23:04.969 --> 01:23:06.369
By Zeus and all the gods...

01:23:06.569 --> 01:23:10.529
...what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?

01:23:10.689 --> 01:23:15.889
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

01:23:16.289 --> 01:23:18.049
Alexander.

01:23:20.609 --> 01:23:25.129
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:30.649
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

01:23:45.289 --> 01:23:49.529
And so 10 years after his mother's
insistence he marry a Macedonian...

01:23:49.689 --> 01:23:51.409
Through our union...

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:53.809
...Greek and barbarian...

01:23:53.969 --> 01:23:59.849
...the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.

01:24:00.009 --> 01:24:01.409
Why?

01:24:07.769 --> 01:24:11.249
Some say it was for alliance
with the tribes.

01:24:12.849 --> 01:24:15.129
Others, the desire for a successor.

01:24:17.409 --> 01:24:22.529
And yet others said Alexander
truly fell in love.

01:24:23.409 --> 01:24:25.289
Who Roxane really was...

01:24:25.449 --> 01:24:31.409
...I doubt any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes.

01:24:33.209 --> 01:24:35.089
Alexander...

01:24:36.689 --> 01:24:39.209
...special for you.

01:24:42.569 --> 01:24:45.169
On this glorious occasion...

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:49.489
...I toast this great army
that has given so much.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:53.609
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

01:24:53.769 --> 01:24:59.729
...I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

01:25:00.049 --> 01:25:01.289
Praise Alexander!

01:25:05.169 --> 01:25:07.209
And in honor of my bride...

01:25:08.249 --> 01:25:10.649
...my beautiful bride...

01:25:10.809 --> 01:25:15.209
...we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

01:25:15.369 --> 01:25:18.689
...and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

01:25:22.489 --> 01:25:25.169
And what about our boys?

01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:26.769
And lastly...

01:25:26.929 --> 01:25:30.089
...lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

01:25:30.249 --> 01:25:33.449
...that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

01:25:33.609 --> 01:25:38.009
...and military training
under our protection...

01:25:38.169 --> 01:25:42.249
...so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

01:25:42.409 --> 01:25:44.769
...in Asia.

01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:24.249
I found it in Egypt.

01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:29.089
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

01:26:29.249 --> 01:26:33.449
...when man worshipped sun and stars.

01:26:38.489 --> 01:26:40.649
I'll always think of you...

01:26:41.409 --> 01:26:43.649
...as the sun, Alexander.

01:26:43.809 --> 01:26:47.809
And I pray your dream
will shine on all men.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:58.489
I wish you a son.

01:26:59.929 --> 01:27:02.249
You're a great man.

01:27:06.409 --> 01:27:09.529
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep...

01:27:25.529 --> 01:27:26.889
You...

01:27:27.089 --> 01:27:28.689
...love him?

01:27:37.209 --> 01:27:40.129
He is Hephaistion.

01:27:53.289 --> 01:27:56.609
There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.

01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:59.129
Come.

01:28:13.009 --> 01:28:14.249
No.

01:28:14.409 --> 01:28:15.929
No, no.

01:29:04.009 --> 01:29:06.089
You have no fear.

01:29:07.449 --> 01:29:09.169
It's fitting.

01:29:10.409 --> 01:29:13.729
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

01:29:13.929 --> 01:29:15.809
...and finds her.

01:29:32.489 --> 01:29:34.209
The myth becomes real.

01:29:44.769 --> 01:29:46.449
Great man?

01:29:46.609 --> 01:29:48.569
Sikander.

01:29:48.729 --> 01:29:50.449
You, I kill now.

01:29:55.809 --> 01:29:57.369
Do it.

01:29:57.809 --> 01:30:00.369
End it. I would do...

01:30:00.809 --> 01:30:02.889
I would do the same.

01:30:03.769 --> 01:30:06.289
I'll die a fool for this...

01:30:06.769 --> 01:30:08.409
...love.

01:30:53.609 --> 01:30:55.569
My life is now yours.

01:31:19.249 --> 01:31:22.849
You will have my son.

01:31:58.049 --> 01:32:02.449
Who is this woman you call
your queen, Alexander?

01:32:02.609 --> 01:32:04.969
A hill girl?

01:32:05.169 --> 01:32:07.569
You, with your breeding.

01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:12.689
Already she makes enemies
with her strong, clumsy nature.

01:32:15.729 --> 01:32:18.009
Do not confuse us.

01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:21.889
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

01:32:22.049 --> 01:32:24.689
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

01:32:25.369 --> 01:32:28.289
Zeus is your father.

01:32:29.809 --> 01:32:33.569
Oh, I understand she brings
you some happiness...

01:32:33.769 --> 01:32:35.409
...but hear me when I tell you...

01:32:35.569 --> 01:32:37.729
...act and act soon.

01:32:37.889 --> 01:32:39.809
After seven years, people wonder:

01:32:39.969 --> 01:32:42.169
"Who is this King Alexander?"

01:32:42.329 --> 01:32:47.889
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

01:32:48.049 --> 01:32:51.049
Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.

01:32:51.809 --> 01:32:53.849
Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.

01:32:54.009 --> 01:32:56.449
But do not chase your dream...

01:32:56.609 --> 01:32:58.569
...further east.

01:32:58.769 --> 01:33:02.409
Your life and mine depend on it.

01:33:03.249 --> 01:33:04.849
Remember...

01:33:05.009 --> 01:33:08.569
...my only thoughts are of you.

01:33:08.729 --> 01:33:12.849
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

01:33:13.009 --> 01:33:15.049
Think kindly of your mother.

01:33:15.209 --> 01:33:16.689
Provide for me.

01:33:16.849 --> 01:33:20.329
Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.

01:33:21.689 --> 01:33:24.209
And remember always...

01:33:24.369 --> 01:33:27.809
...it is I who love you more than any.

01:33:33.809 --> 01:33:36.929
If only you were not a pale reflection...

01:33:37.089 --> 01:33:38.529
...of my mother's heart.

01:34:16.369 --> 01:34:18.249
Who did this?

01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:21.409
- Tell me.
- Hermolaus!

01:34:23.249 --> 01:34:26.889
Never will you find a man
as devoted as I. Yes.

01:34:27.049 --> 01:34:31.289
The conspiracy deeply upset Alexander...

01:34:31.449 --> 01:34:34.089
...not only because it involved
the young pages...

01:34:34.289 --> 01:34:36.049
...who'd shared his dream...

01:34:36.209 --> 01:34:39.729
...but, more intimately,
it implicated Philotas...

01:34:39.889 --> 01:34:45.489
...his companion from boyhood, who was
captain of Alexander's royal guards.

01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:46.889
Alexander.

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:49.849
Remember me for who I am.

01:34:50.609 --> 01:34:53.729
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

01:34:53.889 --> 01:34:57.929
It appears to me and your peers that
the true weather of your soul is ambition.

01:34:58.089 --> 01:34:59.249
No.

01:34:59.409 --> 01:35:01.849
- None of us defended Philotas.
- I didn't do this!

01:35:02.009 --> 01:35:04.329
Then again, none of us ever liked him.

01:35:04.849 --> 01:35:09.249
And, of course, his power
was carved up by the rest of us.

01:35:17.089 --> 01:35:22.529
Before he died, we tortured him to find out
what his father, Parmenion, knew.

01:35:22.689 --> 01:35:24.769
But this we never learned.

01:35:24.929 --> 01:35:28.849
What to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our supply lines...

01:35:29.009 --> 01:35:31.169
...was a far more delicate matter.

01:35:31.329 --> 01:35:35.009
Was he innocent in this,
or had he decided to act...

01:35:35.169 --> 01:35:37.929
...before age further withered his power?

01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:39.569
They'll be divided.

01:35:39.729 --> 01:35:43.089
- The men will follow their king.
- Alexander won't be there.

01:35:44.249 --> 01:35:46.089
Necessity required Alexander to act.

01:35:46.289 --> 01:35:47.689
The infantry will follow me.

01:35:47.849 --> 01:35:52.569
And he sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.

01:35:53.729 --> 01:35:57.489
Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.

01:35:57.649 --> 01:35:59.449
And go quickly.

01:36:01.049 --> 01:36:07.089
Three days' hard riding sent Antigonus
and Cleitus to Parmenion.

01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:13.249
His soldiers accepted the finding
of guilt against Parmenion...

01:36:13.409 --> 01:36:18.329
...as they understood that the head of
family is responsible for the behavior of all.

01:36:47.049 --> 01:36:49.689
Cleitus. Antigonus.

01:36:49.849 --> 01:36:51.409
Parmenion.

01:37:54.009 --> 01:37:57.129
I remember a remark of Bagoas' once...

01:37:57.289 --> 01:38:01.089
...that love eluded Alexander as much,
if not more...

01:38:01.289 --> 01:38:03.409
...than finding the end of the world.

01:38:09.809 --> 01:38:13.729
In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 150,000...

01:38:13.889 --> 01:38:16.809
...across the passes of the Hindu Kush...

01:38:17.329 --> 01:38:19.249
...into the unknown.

01:38:20.489 --> 01:38:25.089
In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.

01:38:25.249 --> 01:38:27.049
We were now a mobile empire...

01:38:27.249 --> 01:38:30.929
...stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.

01:38:31.089 --> 01:38:33.889
Cooks and architects,
doctors and surveyors...

01:38:34.049 --> 01:38:35.449
...moneylenders and wives...

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:38.369
...children, lovers, whores.

01:38:38.529 --> 01:38:40.009
And forget not the slaves...

01:38:40.209 --> 01:38:44.849
...that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.

01:38:45.009 --> 01:38:48.689
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...

01:38:49.529 --> 01:38:53.929
...no occupied territory
remained the same again.

01:38:55.889 --> 01:38:57.929
Although devoted to Roxane...

01:38:58.129 --> 01:39:00.849
...Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...

01:39:01.289 --> 01:39:06.049
...as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...

01:39:06.929 --> 01:39:09.889
...wounding Alexander's great pride.

01:39:12.449 --> 01:39:15.889
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

01:39:16.049 --> 01:39:18.289
In one of those caves.

01:39:19.089 --> 01:39:21.729
They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.

01:39:22.009 --> 01:39:26.609
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

01:39:29.169 --> 01:39:32.449
You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?

01:39:33.329 --> 01:39:34.849
Yes, I do.

01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:37.689
That when we reach these heights...

01:39:37.849 --> 01:39:40.929
...we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

01:39:41.089 --> 01:39:43.609
...and the outer ocean to the east.

01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:52.289
But I fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

01:39:52.489 --> 01:39:54.569
A world of Titans.

01:39:54.729 --> 01:39:58.529
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

01:39:58.729 --> 01:40:00.849
There is no way across.

01:40:01.409 --> 01:40:05.409
Except to the south, into India.

01:40:05.809 --> 01:40:08.729
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

01:40:09.529 --> 01:40:11.169
We will, Alexander.

01:40:11.329 --> 01:40:13.889
In a few years' time, we will return.

01:40:14.049 --> 01:40:17.689
But first, the men must see their homes.

01:40:19.089 --> 01:40:21.049
Have you found your home...

01:40:21.209 --> 01:40:22.849
...Ptolemy?

01:40:27.289 --> 01:40:30.409
More and more, I think
it will be Alexandria.

01:40:32.409 --> 01:40:34.489
Well, at least it's hot.

01:40:35.449 --> 01:40:37.129
And Thais...

01:40:37.969 --> 01:40:39.929
...she loved it there.

01:40:41.649 --> 01:40:43.809
Women bring men home.

01:40:44.849 --> 01:40:49.569
- I have no such feeling.
- You have Babylon, Alexander.

01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:51.809
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

01:40:52.209 --> 01:40:54.609
Yes, I have Babylon.

01:40:54.769 --> 01:40:58.969
But each land, each boundary I cross...

01:40:59.129 --> 01:41:01.369
...I strip away another illusion.

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:04.929
I sense death will be the last.

01:41:07.569 --> 01:41:10.849
Yet still I push harder and harder...

01:41:11.049 --> 01:41:14.449
...to reach this home.

01:41:19.809 --> 01:41:21.129
Where has our eagle gone?

01:41:25.609 --> 01:41:27.609
We must go on, Ptolemy.

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:30.449
Until we find an end.

01:41:38.529 --> 01:41:42.089
India, the land where the sun was born...

01:41:42.289 --> 01:41:44.769
...fabled to be even richer than Persia...

01:41:44.929 --> 01:41:48.809
...had never been explored or conquered.

01:41:49.009 --> 01:41:54.089
From the beginning, Alexander struggled
to unify a land without a center.

01:41:54.289 --> 01:41:56.889
Kings who conspired against one another.

01:41:57.049 --> 01:42:00.929
A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...

01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:05.129
...to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.

01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:09.209
Crateros, in the advance party,
fought against men with hairy skins...

01:42:09.369 --> 01:42:12.729
...who were tiny and lived
in the tops of trees.

01:42:20.569 --> 01:42:23.169
Until Hephaistion convinced us
these were animals...

01:42:23.329 --> 01:42:25.489
...who imitated men
but wore their own skin.

01:42:25.649 --> 01:42:27.209
Keep that away from me.

01:42:27.409 --> 01:42:30.329
They called this tribe "monkey."

01:42:32.369 --> 01:42:33.849
Monkey.

01:42:35.369 --> 01:42:37.329
- Incredible.
- Look at his hands.

01:42:39.409 --> 01:42:41.329
Look, Roxane.

01:42:42.769 --> 01:42:43.929
Hello, little man.

01:42:44.609 --> 01:42:47.649
- Do they speak?
- No, but they do sing.

01:42:47.809 --> 01:42:50.409
And then, there was the rain.

01:42:56.689 --> 01:43:00.289
Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...

01:43:00.449 --> 01:43:03.009
...for 60 days and nights.

01:43:06.329 --> 01:43:08.089
You know better, Machatas.

01:43:08.409 --> 01:43:09.889
What's your son going to say?

01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:12.489
Come on, man.
The older you get, the stronger.

01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:14.529
Right, my king.

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:16.089
Give me my horse, Alexander.

01:43:16.249 --> 01:43:18.369
I'll be with you at your side.

01:43:20.889 --> 01:43:22.569
Watch out for the serpent.

01:43:23.169 --> 01:43:25.169
Hold it, hold it tight.

01:43:26.409 --> 01:43:29.049
Cleitus, bring the snake healers!

01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:32.009
- Pauvanus. Someone bring Pauvanus.
- Where's the bite?

01:43:32.169 --> 01:43:33.849
- What happened?
- It's to the neck.

01:43:34.009 --> 01:43:36.249
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

01:43:36.409 --> 01:43:37.889
Hold on. Hold on.

01:43:38.089 --> 01:43:39.369
Be brave.

01:43:39.529 --> 01:43:41.129
Be brave.

01:43:41.329 --> 01:43:43.209
Oh, Zeus.

01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:48.489
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...

01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:50.889
...there was none to be had.

01:43:51.329 --> 01:43:53.089
Tempers worsened.

01:43:53.249 --> 01:43:56.089
We massacred all Indians who resisted.

01:43:56.249 --> 01:43:58.289
And with the local water putrid...

01:43:58.449 --> 01:44:01.249
...we drank the strong wine.

01:44:51.089 --> 01:44:52.809
As we moved southeast...

01:44:53.009 --> 01:44:57.209
...Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...

01:44:57.689 --> 01:45:00.329
...so as to make of them allies.

01:45:00.489 --> 01:45:02.889
But this did not sit well with the army...

01:45:03.089 --> 01:45:06.369
...who began to wonder if Alexander
was on some crazed quest...

01:45:06.529 --> 01:45:09.649
...to imitate the glory of Herakles.

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:33.609
Give him a kiss.

01:45:33.769 --> 01:45:35.649
Go on, kiss him.

01:45:39.569 --> 01:45:41.329
Give him a kiss.

01:45:51.729 --> 01:45:54.209
- To Bagoas.
- To Bagoas!

01:45:58.729 --> 01:46:02.689
- And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
- Dionysus!

01:46:02.849 --> 01:46:06.929
...who, we're told by our Indian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

01:46:07.089 --> 01:46:09.729
...some 6000 years ago.

01:46:09.889 --> 01:46:11.329
To a hero.

01:46:11.529 --> 01:46:13.409
To a hero!

01:46:31.889 --> 01:46:33.169
Roxane.

01:46:39.689 --> 01:46:42.009
You lose face.

01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:43.649
These Indians...

01:46:43.849 --> 01:46:45.529
...they are a low, evil people.

01:46:45.689 --> 01:46:48.049
You don't try to understand them.

01:46:48.209 --> 01:46:50.409
I try.

01:46:50.569 --> 01:46:53.449
But this I know, Alexander.

01:46:53.609 --> 01:46:56.609
In Persia, you are a great king.

01:46:56.769 --> 01:46:58.249
Here...

01:46:58.409 --> 01:47:00.329
...they hate you.

01:47:02.809 --> 01:47:06.169
Let us go back to Babylon.

01:47:07.089 --> 01:47:08.769
There, you are strong.

01:47:10.809 --> 01:47:13.089
We'll talk about this later.

01:47:13.249 --> 01:47:14.569
Yes.

01:47:14.729 --> 01:47:16.209
Later.

01:47:16.369 --> 01:47:17.849
Talk.

01:47:20.529 --> 01:47:22.409
I shall come.

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:23.889
Tonight.

01:47:24.769 --> 01:47:26.569
And I shall wait.

01:47:28.329 --> 01:47:30.329
Good night, my king.

01:47:31.969 --> 01:47:34.049
Your Majesty.

01:47:34.969 --> 01:47:36.689
I'll toast to Bagoas.

01:47:38.729 --> 01:47:42.049
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

01:47:42.209 --> 01:47:45.049
...we're training to fight
in this great army.

01:47:48.329 --> 01:47:50.209
And to the memory of Philip.

01:47:50.529 --> 01:47:53.289
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

01:47:53.449 --> 01:47:56.369
...transformed into such...

01:47:56.529 --> 01:47:58.209
...a pretty army.

01:48:00.289 --> 01:48:01.529
To Philip.

01:48:01.689 --> 01:48:03.809
To a real hero.

01:48:03.969 --> 01:48:06.049
Philip!

01:48:08.729 --> 01:48:13.449
And to Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.

01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:15.049
Cleitus.

01:48:16.409 --> 01:48:18.929
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

01:48:19.089 --> 01:48:21.969
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:23.889
...after 30 years' service.

01:48:24.049 --> 01:48:27.969
You call governing
this major province exile?

01:48:28.169 --> 01:48:31.169
Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...

01:48:31.809 --> 01:48:33.849
...a province so far from home?

01:48:34.009 --> 01:48:37.289
Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?

01:48:40.049 --> 01:48:42.089
So be it.

01:48:42.249 --> 01:48:45.569
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...

01:48:45.729 --> 01:48:47.809
...rather than shine...

01:48:47.969 --> 01:48:49.249
...in Eastern pomp.

01:48:50.609 --> 01:48:54.249
I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.

01:48:54.409 --> 01:48:57.809
Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.

01:48:58.289 --> 01:49:02.409
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:07.329
...Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...

01:49:07.529 --> 01:49:10.529
...bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

01:49:10.689 --> 01:49:13.329
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

01:49:13.489 --> 01:49:16.929
You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?

01:49:20.169 --> 01:49:21.569
Only when offered.

01:49:21.769 --> 01:49:24.089
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

01:49:24.529 --> 01:49:27.089
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

01:49:27.249 --> 01:49:29.729
You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...

01:49:29.929 --> 01:49:31.489
...but a son of Zeus.

01:49:31.649 --> 01:49:35.209
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

01:49:36.369 --> 01:49:38.249
Why not?

01:49:40.649 --> 01:49:42.609
I've achieved more in my years.

01:49:42.769 --> 01:49:44.649
Traveled as far.

01:49:44.809 --> 01:49:46.009
Probably farther.

01:49:46.169 --> 01:49:48.289
Herakles did it by himself.

01:49:48.449 --> 01:49:51.329
Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?

01:49:51.529 --> 01:49:53.249
Who planned the Asian invasion?

01:49:53.409 --> 01:49:55.049
Was it not your father?

01:49:55.209 --> 01:49:57.249
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

01:49:57.569 --> 01:50:00.969
- Zeus-Amon, is it?
- You insult me, Cleitus.

01:50:01.129 --> 01:50:03.809
You mock my family. Be careful.

01:50:04.169 --> 01:50:07.609
Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...

01:50:07.769 --> 01:50:10.329
...asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.

01:50:10.489 --> 01:50:12.329
Are we not good enough any longer?

01:50:12.489 --> 01:50:14.489
I remember a time...

01:50:14.649 --> 01:50:17.129
...when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

01:50:17.289 --> 01:50:20.049
None of this scraping, groveling.

01:50:21.689 --> 01:50:23.649
Now you kiss them?

01:50:24.289 --> 01:50:29.089
Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?

01:50:31.449 --> 01:50:35.449
Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.

01:50:38.969 --> 01:50:42.329
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:47.009
This army...
This army is your blood, boy!

01:50:47.169 --> 01:50:49.129
Without it, you're nothing!

01:50:54.009 --> 01:50:56.329
You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!

01:50:56.489 --> 01:50:59.129
- Get him from my sight!
- I don't serve your purpose?!

01:50:59.289 --> 01:51:03.169
What was I serving when I saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

01:51:03.369 --> 01:51:06.609
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

01:51:06.769 --> 01:51:08.129
Alexander!

01:51:08.289 --> 01:51:10.529
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

01:51:17.609 --> 01:51:19.369
- Who's with him?
- No.

01:51:19.529 --> 01:51:20.969
Who's with him?

01:51:21.609 --> 01:51:23.689
I call Father Zeus to witness.

01:51:23.849 --> 01:51:26.049
I call you to trial before him!

01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:28.609
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

01:51:28.769 --> 01:51:30.889
- Take him!
- You speak of plots against you?

01:51:31.049 --> 01:51:32.489
What about poor Parmenion?

01:51:32.649 --> 01:51:35.369
You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?

01:51:36.329 --> 01:51:39.249
Hypocrite. Despot. False king.

01:51:40.049 --> 01:51:42.889
You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.

01:52:06.569 --> 01:52:08.249
Cleitus.

01:52:08.409 --> 01:52:10.209
Oh, my Cleitus.

01:52:17.369 --> 01:52:18.849
- Let me pass.
- None can enter.

01:52:19.009 --> 01:52:20.809
I am the queen.

01:52:24.489 --> 01:52:26.609
I want to see him. I've waited three days.

01:52:26.769 --> 01:52:29.449
He says none, not even you.

01:52:30.449 --> 01:52:34.209
- He needs me.
- No, he doesn't.

01:52:34.369 --> 01:52:36.129
And he needs you?

01:52:37.689 --> 01:52:40.089
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.

01:52:46.009 --> 01:52:48.809
The army needs your reassurance.

01:52:49.249 --> 01:52:50.889
Alexander.

01:52:52.809 --> 01:52:54.369
Yes.

01:52:54.569 --> 01:52:58.249
Like an old lover they forgive,
but they will never forget.

01:52:59.929 --> 01:53:01.209
You know more than any...

01:53:01.369 --> 01:53:05.729
...great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted.

01:53:05.929 --> 01:53:07.889
You're Alexander.

01:53:08.049 --> 01:53:10.769
Pity and grief will only destroy you.

01:53:10.929 --> 01:53:14.649
Have I become so arrogant
that I am blind?

01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:17.929
Sometimes...

01:53:18.089 --> 01:53:20.129
...to expect the best of everyone...

01:53:20.769 --> 01:53:22.729
...is arrogance.

01:53:25.569 --> 01:53:28.169
Then Cleitus spoke true.

01:53:28.329 --> 01:53:30.209
I am become a tyrant.

01:53:30.609 --> 01:53:32.649
You're mortal.

01:53:32.849 --> 01:53:34.689
And they know it.

01:53:34.849 --> 01:53:39.329
And they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves.

01:53:40.329 --> 01:53:42.089
I've failed...

01:53:42.249 --> 01:53:43.969
...utterly.

01:54:12.249 --> 01:54:15.329
Philip, King of Macedonia...

01:54:15.489 --> 01:54:17.289
...and leader of the Greeks.

01:54:18.009 --> 01:54:22.769
All my life, I've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

01:54:24.009 --> 01:54:26.049
Today is that day.

01:54:33.289 --> 01:54:35.929
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

01:54:36.089 --> 01:54:39.809
...but Alexander is simply great."

01:54:41.129 --> 01:54:43.689
But if you ever insult me again...

01:54:43.849 --> 01:54:45.769
...I’ll kill you.

01:54:51.329 --> 01:54:52.649
I've missed you.

01:54:52.809 --> 01:54:55.369
In the spring, Persia.

01:54:55.529 --> 01:54:57.609
You'll command my horse from the right.

01:54:57.769 --> 01:54:59.929
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

01:55:00.089 --> 01:55:01.769
...for all the gold in the world.

01:55:01.929 --> 01:55:04.449
Which, one day, you'll have.

01:55:08.849 --> 01:55:11.329
Making himself a 13th god.

01:55:11.489 --> 01:55:13.529
He's drunk so much wine, my poor Philip.

01:55:13.689 --> 01:55:15.489
He's lost his mind.

01:55:18.409 --> 01:55:21.009
- Your Majesty.
- Attalus.

01:55:25.329 --> 01:55:28.129
I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...

01:55:28.289 --> 01:55:31.049
...as much as our regent.

01:55:31.209 --> 01:55:32.769
He's very tired.

01:55:36.809 --> 01:55:39.009
Hey.

01:55:41.289 --> 01:55:44.289
- Pausanias, bring the rest of the guard.
- Royal guard!

01:55:44.529 --> 01:55:47.129
To the arena! March!

01:55:47.289 --> 01:55:50.089
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?

01:55:50.249 --> 01:55:53.449
- Greeks all over the place.
- Cleitus, Cleitus.

01:55:53.609 --> 01:55:55.609
My Cleitus.

01:55:56.009 --> 01:55:58.569
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

01:55:59.009 --> 01:56:00.529
Treat him as you would me.

01:56:00.689 --> 01:56:02.809
He'll guard your back for you.

01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:05.409
Yes, Father.

01:56:05.569 --> 01:56:07.849
My people are guard enough today.

01:56:08.009 --> 01:56:11.489
Let these Greeks see for themselves
how I can walk through my people.

01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:13.089
Then let them call me tyrant.

01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:16.729
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

01:56:16.889 --> 01:56:20.409
Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.

01:56:20.569 --> 01:56:22.529
I want them to like me.

01:56:29.369 --> 01:56:31.889
Weren't you told? I go in alone.

01:56:32.049 --> 01:56:34.049
Follow with the main guard.

01:56:34.249 --> 01:56:35.609
Go on.

01:56:38.529 --> 01:56:41.729
- Go on.
- Father, it's best I go with you.

01:56:44.529 --> 01:56:47.489
You want the world to see
you're my successor.

01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:49.569
Is that what she wants?

01:56:50.049 --> 01:56:52.689
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

01:56:52.849 --> 01:56:56.889
You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.

01:57:00.489 --> 01:57:02.569
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

01:57:02.729 --> 01:57:05.209
...obey me this once!

01:57:06.449 --> 01:57:08.929
Have courage, Father.

01:57:09.089 --> 01:57:11.489
And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...

01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:13.769
...you may recall your valor.

01:57:48.089 --> 01:57:51.849
And now, our beloved King Philip...

01:57:52.009 --> 01:57:55.009
...in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

01:58:12.249 --> 01:58:14.569
Pausanias, I told you...

01:59:02.729 --> 01:59:04.329
The king is slain!

01:59:51.769 --> 01:59:54.169
The king lives!

01:59:54.329 --> 01:59:57.609
Alexander, son of Philip!

01:59:57.769 --> 01:59:59.489
May the gods bless the king!

02:00:03.849 --> 02:00:06.489
You're king now. You're king.

02:00:14.329 --> 02:00:17.649
May the gods bless Alexander!

02:00:19.529 --> 02:00:21.609
- Alexander!
- Alexander!

02:00:30.249 --> 02:00:31.529
Get out.

02:00:32.969 --> 02:00:34.369
Go.

02:00:39.089 --> 02:00:41.409
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

02:00:41.569 --> 02:00:43.729
Because it was meant to be.

02:00:43.889 --> 02:00:45.889
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

02:00:46.049 --> 02:00:50.209
- No one blames you.
- They blame me behind my back! In secret.

02:00:50.369 --> 02:00:51.849
- Slander is not power.
- Shame is?

02:00:54.529 --> 02:00:56.449
Who killed my father?

02:00:56.929 --> 02:00:58.449
Tell me.

02:00:58.609 --> 02:01:01.209
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

02:01:01.369 --> 02:01:03.849
- Pausanias.
- He had help!

02:01:04.009 --> 02:01:06.049
Did you help him?

02:01:12.889 --> 02:01:15.089
No, never.

02:01:15.529 --> 02:01:18.369
Why? Why would I?

02:01:19.449 --> 02:01:21.049
So many wanted it.

02:01:21.209 --> 02:01:22.529
Greeks, Persians, men...

02:01:22.689 --> 02:01:24.569
You're mad. You're cursed.

02:01:24.729 --> 02:01:27.289
You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.

02:01:27.449 --> 02:01:30.249
Now who is exaggerating?

02:01:31.129 --> 02:01:33.329
Even if it was the wish of your heart...

02:01:33.489 --> 02:01:36.089
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

02:01:36.249 --> 02:01:38.049
He was not your father!

02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:40.249
You owe no blood debt to that man.

02:01:40.409 --> 02:01:43.089
You lie and lie and lie.

02:01:43.249 --> 02:01:46.209
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

02:01:46.369 --> 02:01:49.609
Look at you. Look at you.

02:01:49.769 --> 02:01:53.129
You are everything that he was not.

02:01:53.289 --> 02:01:56.489
He was coarse, you are refined.

02:01:56.649 --> 02:02:00.369
He was a general, and you are a king.

02:02:00.529 --> 02:02:02.489
He could not rule himself...

02:02:02.729 --> 02:02:05.729
...and you shall rule the world.

02:02:05.929 --> 02:02:09.449
You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.

02:02:09.609 --> 02:02:11.449
Such thick pride...

02:02:11.609 --> 02:02:13.449
...and no mourning for your husband.

02:02:13.609 --> 02:02:14.929
Mourn...

02:02:15.089 --> 02:02:16.609
...him?

02:02:17.529 --> 02:02:19.969
What do you know of Philip?

02:02:21.409 --> 02:02:25.529
No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.

02:02:26.249 --> 02:02:29.809
- Act like it.
- My first act would be to kill you!

02:02:31.049 --> 02:02:33.289
You murdered me in my cradle.

02:02:33.449 --> 02:02:35.569
You birthed me in a sack of hate.

02:02:35.729 --> 02:02:37.809
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

02:02:37.969 --> 02:02:41.689
- Hate you have for men.
- I taught you my heart, Alexander!

02:02:41.849 --> 02:02:45.529
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

02:02:45.689 --> 02:02:47.889
Damn your sorceress soul.

02:02:48.049 --> 02:02:50.649
Your soul is mine, Alexander.

02:02:52.049 --> 02:02:53.529
No! No!

02:02:54.089 --> 02:02:57.849
You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!

02:02:58.449 --> 02:03:00.409
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

02:03:00.569 --> 02:03:02.929
You're a king. Act like one.

02:03:03.089 --> 02:03:04.769
Parmenion is with us, for once.

02:03:04.969 --> 02:03:06.729
Execute Attalus without delay.

02:03:06.889 --> 02:03:09.729
Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.

02:03:09.889 --> 02:03:11.249
Eurydice? Never.

02:03:11.409 --> 02:03:12.809
Laugh, you monster.

02:03:12.969 --> 02:03:14.249
You heartbreaker.

02:03:14.409 --> 02:03:17.209
How will you live out the year like this?

02:03:17.369 --> 02:03:21.929
- Have you learned nothing from Philip?
- No. From you, Mother.

02:03:24.969 --> 02:03:26.569
The best.

02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:40.609
What have I done
to make you hate me so?

02:03:42.289 --> 02:03:46.729
One day, you will understand this.

02:03:46.889 --> 02:03:50.329
But I have only you in my heart.

02:03:52.849 --> 02:03:55.969
I know what you need.

02:03:56.809 --> 02:03:59.049
Now is the time.

02:03:59.209 --> 02:04:01.369
The gods favor you.

02:04:01.689 --> 02:04:04.849
Great wealth, power, conquest.

02:04:05.009 --> 02:04:06.729
All you desire.

02:04:06.889 --> 02:04:09.409
The world is yours!

02:04:09.569 --> 02:04:11.409
Take it.

02:04:15.769 --> 02:04:17.449
Take it.

02:04:38.729 --> 02:04:42.009
He never saw his mother again.

02:04:44.689 --> 02:04:47.769
And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...

02:04:47.929 --> 02:04:53.369
...Olympias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.

02:04:54.889 --> 02:04:56.369
By necessity...

02:04:56.529 --> 02:05:00.169
...he had her uncle Attalus executed.

02:05:21.209 --> 02:05:22.769
Of course you have fears.

02:05:22.929 --> 02:05:24.329
We all have fears...

02:05:24.489 --> 02:05:27.489
...because no one has ever
gone this far before.

02:05:28.049 --> 02:05:32.329
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

02:05:32.609 --> 02:05:34.169
We'll build a fleet of ships...

02:05:34.329 --> 02:05:37.169
...and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:40.329
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

02:05:40.689 --> 02:05:42.849
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

02:05:43.009 --> 02:05:46.449
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

02:05:46.609 --> 02:05:51.249
And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.

02:05:52.409 --> 02:05:55.769
- Follow Alexander.
- I'll follow you.

02:06:00.209 --> 02:06:01.809
What?

02:06:01.969 --> 02:06:05.249
- Silence?
- We're with you, Alexander!

02:06:05.409 --> 02:06:06.569
Peucestas.

02:06:06.889 --> 02:06:08.929
A hero.

02:06:09.089 --> 02:06:12.129
Where are the Amazons of myth
who dare to fight and kill men?

02:06:12.489 --> 02:06:14.049
Where have they gone?

02:06:15.489 --> 02:06:18.169
We'll never leave you, Alexander!

02:06:19.209 --> 02:06:20.409
You, Meleager.

02:06:20.569 --> 02:06:23.889
Who are these tribes ahead
compared to those we've vanquished?

02:06:26.889 --> 02:06:28.569
Lysimachus?

02:06:31.049 --> 02:06:32.569
Antigonus.

02:06:34.569 --> 02:06:37.089
You break my heart, you men.

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:39.049
Afraid.

02:06:39.969 --> 02:06:41.409
Crateros.

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:44.689
Crateros.

02:06:44.849 --> 02:06:45.929
And another one.

02:06:46.089 --> 02:06:47.849
Crateros.

02:06:49.289 --> 02:06:51.049
Crateros.

02:06:57.449 --> 02:06:59.009
My king.

02:07:00.329 --> 02:07:04.289
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

02:07:06.009 --> 02:07:08.129
I lost many a man.

02:07:09.169 --> 02:07:11.689
Young ones, never been with a woman.

02:07:12.889 --> 02:07:14.969
Some died of disease.

02:07:15.529 --> 02:07:19.529
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

02:07:19.689 --> 02:07:21.409
Some died good.

02:07:21.569 --> 02:07:24.449
Some just didn't get no luck.

02:07:25.289 --> 02:07:26.929
But they died.

02:07:29.169 --> 02:07:31.969
Forty thousand I come over with
eight years ago.

02:07:32.129 --> 02:07:36.009
And we march after you
more than 10,000 miles.

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:40.649
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

02:07:40.809 --> 02:07:43.809
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

02:07:44.489 --> 02:07:46.809
We killed many a barbarian.

02:07:48.409 --> 02:07:53.049
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do I see?

02:07:53.209 --> 02:07:56.809
Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.

02:07:56.969 --> 02:08:00.409
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

02:08:00.569 --> 02:08:03.369
...cross a hundred more rivers.

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:08.129
Crateros. Good Crateros.

02:08:08.969 --> 02:08:13.889
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

02:08:14.889 --> 02:08:18.609
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

02:08:18.769 --> 02:08:24.329
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

02:08:24.489 --> 02:08:27.769
You have, my king,
and we love you for it.

02:08:28.689 --> 02:08:32.129
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

02:08:32.729 --> 02:08:36.129
You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...

02:08:36.289 --> 02:08:40.769
...humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

02:08:40.969 --> 02:08:47.169
...is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

02:08:47.649 --> 02:08:51.289
...before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

02:08:55.049 --> 02:08:58.569
Yes. You're right, Crateros.

02:08:58.729 --> 02:09:00.009
I have been negligent.

02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:04.809
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

02:09:04.969 --> 02:09:07.569
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:12.609
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

02:09:13.889 --> 02:09:17.369
And respected, rich, loved.

02:09:17.529 --> 02:09:22.209
You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...

02:09:22.369 --> 02:09:26.369
...and enjoy a peaceful death.

02:09:27.649 --> 02:09:29.689
But you dream, Crateros.

02:09:30.409 --> 02:09:34.569
Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...

02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:38.849
...and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

02:09:39.529 --> 02:09:44.649
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

02:09:45.609 --> 02:09:47.849
Do you not see?

02:09:48.969 --> 02:09:52.129
And you, as well as I, know...

02:09:52.289 --> 02:09:56.369
...that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

02:09:56.529 --> 02:09:59.209
...and all your great victories fade...

02:09:59.369 --> 02:10:04.809
...it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

02:10:04.969 --> 02:10:07.529
For I will go on, with my Asians.

02:10:10.889 --> 02:10:15.009
- To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
- We come for you, and you discard us.

02:10:15.169 --> 02:10:17.449
- Shame!
- We want to go home, Alexander.

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:19.289
We're tired of glory.

02:10:19.449 --> 02:10:22.249
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:26.169
I've got children I haven't even seen.

02:10:29.809 --> 02:10:32.729
I want to see my children.

02:10:32.889 --> 02:10:36.489
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

02:10:36.649 --> 02:10:39.769
And all I've asked of you
is one more month.

02:10:42.529 --> 02:10:44.329
- Shame.
- That's your king.

02:10:45.209 --> 02:10:46.729
What would your father say?

02:10:46.889 --> 02:10:49.929
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:53.889
So go home. I look to the
barbarians for their courage.

02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:56.649
I go east.

02:10:56.809 --> 02:10:58.769
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

02:10:58.929 --> 02:11:01.049
- Who said that?
- We won't make it to Macedonia.

02:11:01.209 --> 02:11:02.929
You despicable coward. Come forth.

02:11:03.089 --> 02:11:05.889
- Make your accusations public.
- So you can have us killed?

02:11:06.049 --> 02:11:08.929
- Son of Zeus.
- You desecrate your real father's memory.

02:11:09.089 --> 02:11:14.969
- Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
- Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

02:11:23.529 --> 02:11:28.089
You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.

02:11:28.249 --> 02:11:32.009
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

02:11:32.169 --> 02:11:35.649
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.

02:11:35.809 --> 02:11:38.809
And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.

02:11:39.969 --> 02:11:43.769
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.

02:11:44.489 --> 02:11:48.089
Arrest him.
After all I've done for you, you swine.

02:11:48.249 --> 02:11:50.089
You cowards. Traitors.

02:11:52.489 --> 02:11:54.809
Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?

02:11:57.089 --> 02:12:01.409
He drove on, south to the outer ocean.

02:12:03.049 --> 02:12:07.209
In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...

02:12:07.369 --> 02:12:12.289
...he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.

02:12:12.489 --> 02:12:15.769
But clearly, the army was divided.

02:12:16.649 --> 02:12:20.929
And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.

02:12:32.489 --> 02:12:34.369
Stay calm.

02:12:34.689 --> 02:12:36.449
Together we are strong as gods.

02:12:38.009 --> 02:12:42.409
Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.

02:12:46.089 --> 02:12:48.449
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

02:12:54.249 --> 02:12:56.329
Lock shields.

02:12:58.809 --> 02:13:00.889
Battle positions.

02:13:02.729 --> 02:13:04.249
Move.

02:13:10.169 --> 02:13:13.249
Choppers, prepare your knives.

02:13:13.449 --> 02:13:15.129
Follow me.

02:13:30.809 --> 02:13:34.089
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

02:13:51.489 --> 02:13:55.849
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.

02:13:56.009 --> 02:13:58.169
Cavalry!

02:14:06.369 --> 02:14:09.529
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

02:14:54.609 --> 02:14:59.689
- Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
- Follow Alexander.

02:15:03.009 --> 02:15:06.569
Charge. Charge. Charge.

02:15:09.689 --> 02:15:11.449
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

02:15:11.609 --> 02:15:14.809
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

02:15:14.969 --> 02:15:18.649
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

02:15:18.809 --> 02:15:21.849
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:40.409
Hephaistion. To the center.

02:15:43.049 --> 02:15:45.289
Come, Macedonians. Ride.

02:15:45.449 --> 02:15:47.809
Ride.

02:16:28.929 --> 02:16:31.449
Coenus! Get out of there.

02:16:32.568 --> 02:16:34.009
No.

02:17:02.449 --> 02:17:05.209
- The horses won't go.
- On foot, then.

02:17:11.449 --> 02:17:15.329
Fall back, men! Fall back!

02:17:16.648 --> 02:17:18.169
Come, Bucephalus.

02:17:26.409 --> 02:17:28.609
'Tis only sun and shadow.

02:17:31.249 --> 02:17:33.929
You and I together,
one last time, Bucephalus.

02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:39.289
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

02:17:39.449 --> 02:17:42.089
...and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

02:17:42.648 --> 02:17:45.929
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?

02:17:46.089 --> 02:17:51.689
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

02:18:07.049 --> 02:18:09.249
Attack.

02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:12.609
Alexander!

02:18:23.049 --> 02:18:24.929
Alexander.

02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:55.529
- The king is down!
- To the king!

02:21:14.529 --> 02:21:20.769
It was the bloodiest of his battles.
Pure butchery, the end of all reason.

02:21:24.529 --> 02:21:26.489
We'd never be men again.

02:23:05.489 --> 02:23:08.969
He lives! Alexander!

02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:37.129
Men of Macedon...

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:39.849
...we're going home.

02:23:40.929 --> 02:23:43.209
- What?
- What?

02:23:43.369 --> 02:23:45.009
- We're going home.
- Home?

02:23:45.209 --> 02:23:47.249
We're going.

02:23:51.689 --> 02:23:53.569
We're going home.

02:24:55.889 --> 02:24:58.849
His life should have ended in India...

02:24:59.969 --> 02:25:01.889
...but that's myth.

02:25:03.529 --> 02:25:09.129
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.

02:25:12.609 --> 02:25:16.329
Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...

02:25:16.489 --> 02:25:21.129
...Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...

02:25:21.289 --> 02:25:23.369
...across the great Gedrosian desert...

02:25:23.569 --> 02:25:26.889
...seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.

02:25:28.049 --> 02:25:32.769
To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.

02:25:34.649 --> 02:25:38.249
It was the worst blunder of his life.

02:25:38.409 --> 02:25:42.689
And when he finally reentered Babylon,
after six years in the Far East...

02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:48.609
...Alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives.

02:26:09.769 --> 02:26:12.609
- Just last night he was...
- It's the water, Your Majesty.

02:26:12.769 --> 02:26:14.889
He mixed it with the wine.

02:26:15.929 --> 02:26:17.489
But how can this be?

02:26:17.649 --> 02:26:21.529
- Typhus of India?
- I wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

02:26:21.689 --> 02:26:26.369
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold...

02:26:27.449 --> 02:26:28.809
Come, doctor.

02:26:37.049 --> 02:26:39.289
I feel better.

02:26:39.889 --> 02:26:43.609
Soon, I'll be up.

02:26:44.489 --> 02:26:48.249
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and I couldn't leave without you.

02:26:48.809 --> 02:26:51.129
Arabia.

02:26:53.769 --> 02:26:58.889
You used to dress me up like a sheik...

02:26:59.529 --> 02:27:01.369
...wave your wooden scimitar.

02:27:01.529 --> 02:27:04.489
You were the only one
who'd never let me win.

02:27:06.249 --> 02:27:09.129
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

02:27:09.609 --> 02:27:12.409
You saved me from myself.

02:27:14.729 --> 02:27:17.769
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

02:27:19.689 --> 02:27:22.009
My Alexander.

02:27:23.529 --> 02:27:29.049
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles and then outdid him.

02:27:29.209 --> 02:27:33.369
And you, Patroclus.
And then what happened?

02:27:33.529 --> 02:27:36.769
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

02:27:37.329 --> 02:27:43.249
- But how beautiful a myth it was.
- We reach, we fall.

02:27:44.449 --> 02:27:47.289
Oh, Hephaistion.

02:27:52.689 --> 02:27:58.049
- I worry for you without me.
- I am nothing without you.

02:27:58.969 --> 02:28:02.529
Come, fight, Hephaistion.

02:28:02.809 --> 02:28:05.209
We will die together.

02:28:06.809 --> 02:28:09.129
It's our destiny.

02:28:12.209 --> 02:28:17.569
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

02:28:18.569 --> 02:28:22.049
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

02:28:22.729 --> 02:28:27.289
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

02:28:28.089 --> 02:28:32.409
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

02:28:32.569 --> 02:28:37.289
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

02:28:37.449 --> 02:28:41.609
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

02:28:42.569 --> 02:28:45.009
And then explore the northern forests...

02:28:45.169 --> 02:28:48.769
...and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

02:28:49.969 --> 02:28:54.049
And then one day,
not 10 years from now...

02:28:54.609 --> 02:28:59.169
...Babylon, with its deep-water harbor,
will be the center of the world.

02:28:59.329 --> 02:29:04.249
Alexandrias will grow,
populations will mix and travel freely.

02:29:04.409 --> 02:29:07.009
Asia and Europe will come together.

02:29:08.729 --> 02:29:12.489
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

02:29:13.129 --> 02:29:18.529
...looking out our balcony
at this new world.

02:29:24.729 --> 02:29:27.049
Hephaistion?

02:29:28.369 --> 02:29:30.649
Hephaistion?

02:29:37.329 --> 02:29:41.769
- Where is this doctor?
- I can't explain this, Your Majesty.

02:29:41.929 --> 02:29:46.169
- It's not possible. I swear by Apollo.
- Execute him!

02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:50.329
Take him out now and execute him.

02:29:50.489 --> 02:29:54.529
- Come away, come away.
- Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

02:29:55.209 --> 02:29:58.689
Get out. Get out now!

02:30:06.329 --> 02:30:08.729
Be gone.

02:30:08.889 --> 02:30:13.609
Be gone with you.
Harpies. Get out. Get out.

02:30:13.769 --> 02:30:15.529
Are you drunk again?

02:30:15.689 --> 02:30:17.209
- Get out.
- He's dead.

02:30:17.369 --> 02:30:20.009
- Who?
- Many hated him...

02:30:20.169 --> 02:30:23.009
...but I don't think any other
would have dared.

02:30:24.449 --> 02:30:26.409
Hephaistion is dead?

02:30:30.209 --> 02:30:32.089
Are you mad?

02:30:34.129 --> 02:30:35.609
You monster.

02:30:36.769 --> 02:30:39.569
- Are you mad?
- You've taken from me all I've ever loved.

02:30:39.729 --> 02:30:43.769
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

02:30:44.809 --> 02:30:49.249
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

02:30:50.729 --> 02:30:53.409
- Alexander, we have a son.
- No.

02:30:54.969 --> 02:30:57.409
- The child.
- Oh, Your Majesty, no.

02:30:57.569 --> 02:31:03.689
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

02:31:03.849 --> 02:31:06.209
We have a son.

02:31:06.689 --> 02:31:09.929
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

02:31:11.529 --> 02:31:13.089
Never touch me again.

02:31:16.369 --> 02:31:18.329
No!

02:31:23.689 --> 02:31:26.369
One last toast!

02:31:29.569 --> 02:31:31.369
Before the dawn.

02:31:38.129 --> 02:31:41.169
To my old friends.

02:31:57.409 --> 02:32:01.129
- And to the myths.
- To the myths.

02:32:09.049 --> 02:32:11.289
Drink it down, Alexander.

02:32:11.449 --> 02:32:13.449
Drink it down.

02:32:27.289 --> 02:32:30.529
Yes, come on. Finish it.

02:32:49.449 --> 02:32:51.489
To the next dawn.

02:33:06.249 --> 02:33:08.449
Yes, come.

02:33:08.649 --> 02:33:14.849
Come to Babylon. I await you.
Your only loving son.

02:33:23.529 --> 02:33:26.569
Wait. Wait.

02:33:27.369 --> 02:33:29.529
Vultures. Wait.

02:33:29.689 --> 02:33:32.249
Your son, Alexander.

02:33:32.409 --> 02:33:34.889
Just three more months.

02:33:35.049 --> 02:33:38.849
Please live. Alexander.

02:33:39.009 --> 02:33:43.449
Alexander, we beg you. Tell us who.

02:33:43.609 --> 02:33:46.409
Who will rule this great empire
if you leave us?

02:33:46.609 --> 02:33:49.569
- Fear not. We're at the beginning.
- You're a great man.

02:33:50.729 --> 02:33:52.729
The myth becomes real.

02:33:57.849 --> 02:34:00.169
Beyond Herakles.

02:34:04.889 --> 02:34:08.409
When it's over, all that matters is
what you've done. I'll remember.

02:34:08.569 --> 02:34:11.369
Zeus is your father.

02:34:12.329 --> 02:34:14.529
Alexander, the army will divide.

02:34:14.689 --> 02:34:17.449
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

02:34:17.609 --> 02:34:18.849
Who will it be?

02:34:19.969 --> 02:34:22.369
Pray tell us, who?

02:34:24.649 --> 02:34:27.209
- What did he say?
- "To the best."

02:34:29.209 --> 02:34:31.489
- He said, "To the best."
- What?

02:34:31.649 --> 02:34:33.889
- No, he said, "To Crateros."
- To Crateros?

02:34:34.049 --> 02:34:35.649
Why would he say Crateros?

02:35:34.609 --> 02:35:38.689
On the 10th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...

02:35:38.849 --> 02:35:43.089
...Alexander's great heart
finally gave out.

02:35:43.249 --> 02:35:47.289
And as he vowed,
he joined Hephaistion.

02:35:50.489 --> 02:35:53.089
But in his short life,
he achieved, without doubt...

02:35:53.249 --> 02:35:58.409
...the mythic glory
of his ancestor Achilles and more.

02:36:01.609 --> 02:36:04.129
His sacrifice was an early death...

02:36:04.329 --> 02:36:06.569
...but in keeping
to his side of the bargain...

02:36:06.729 --> 02:36:10.409
...I cannot help but feel
he conquered death as well.

02:36:13.049 --> 02:36:15.849
Olympias' transgression
in the murder of his father...

02:36:16.009 --> 02:36:18.649
...is, to my mind, a probability.

02:36:18.809 --> 02:36:21.289
His, a burden.

02:36:22.129 --> 02:36:26.329
Alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it.

02:36:26.489 --> 02:36:31.889
But by blood, and blood alone,
he was guilty.

02:36:34.569 --> 02:36:36.489
No!

02:36:41.969 --> 02:36:44.129
- The body stays in Babylon.
- Within hours...

02:36:44.329 --> 02:36:47.169
...we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.

02:36:47.369 --> 02:36:49.409
The wars of the world had begun.

02:36:49.929 --> 02:36:51.929
Forty years, off and on, they endured.

02:36:52.529 --> 02:36:56.729
Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.

02:36:56.889 --> 02:37:01.089
Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egypt.

02:37:01.249 --> 02:37:06.409
- Until we divided his empire in four parts.
- Gentlemen, we are not savages.

02:37:06.569 --> 02:37:09.089
Cassander certainly proved
his will to power...

02:37:09.289 --> 02:37:13.649
...when seven years later,
he had Olympias executed.

02:37:14.409 --> 02:37:16.969
And within 12 years, he achieved...

02:37:17.129 --> 02:37:19.969
...the complete destruction
of Alexander's bloodline...

02:37:21.449 --> 02:37:23.289
...when he poisoned Roxane...

02:37:23.449 --> 02:37:28.969
...and Alexander's 13-year-old son,
the true heir to the empire.

02:37:31.689 --> 02:37:35.169
But the truth is never simple...

02:37:36.009 --> 02:37:38.009
...and yet it is.

02:37:38.449 --> 02:37:41.369
The truth is, we did kill him.

02:37:44.809 --> 02:37:48.089
By silence, we consented.

02:37:48.489 --> 02:37:50.409
Because...

02:37:50.569 --> 02:37:52.969
Because we couldn't go on.

02:37:53.129 --> 02:37:58.249
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

02:37:58.409 --> 02:38:03.449
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

02:38:03.609 --> 02:38:06.689
Mixing the races, harmony?

02:38:07.649 --> 02:38:10.289
Oh, he talked of these things...

02:38:10.449 --> 02:38:15.969
...but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

02:38:16.969 --> 02:38:19.809
I never believed in his dream.

02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:22.009
None of us did.

02:38:23.689 --> 02:38:25.849
That's the truth of his life.

02:38:26.009 --> 02:38:28.489
The dreamers exhaust us.

02:38:29.209 --> 02:38:33.209
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

02:38:34.529 --> 02:38:37.289
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

02:38:37.449 --> 02:38:39.769
It's an old fool's rubbish.

02:38:41.529 --> 02:38:46.729
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

02:38:47.489 --> 02:38:49.249
Yes, great Pharaoh.

02:38:49.409 --> 02:38:53.129
Oh, he could've stayed home in Macedonia,
married, raised a family.

02:38:54.329 --> 02:38:57.249
He'd have died a celebrated man.

02:38:59.529 --> 02:39:02.209
But this was not Alexander.

02:39:02.529 --> 02:39:08.169
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

02:39:08.329 --> 02:39:14.249
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

02:39:15.609 --> 02:39:19.409
The freest man I've ever known.

02:39:21.009 --> 02:39:25.809
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

02:39:25.969 --> 02:39:29.569
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

02:39:29.889 --> 02:39:32.449
And if his desire...

02:39:32.649 --> 02:39:37.329
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

02:39:39.769 --> 02:39:42.769
What failure!

02:39:43.049 --> 02:39:48.929
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

02:39:53.409 --> 02:39:55.089
I've lived...

02:39:55.289 --> 02:39:57.569
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

02:39:57.729 --> 02:40:00.009
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

02:40:00.169 --> 02:40:04.889
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

02:40:05.329 --> 02:40:10.369
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

02:40:11.529 --> 02:40:15.249
...Megas Alexandros.

02:40:16.649 --> 02:40:19.689
The greatest Alexander of them all.
