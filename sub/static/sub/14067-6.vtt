<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:02.500 --> 00:04.200
Oh, I'm in trouble now.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.000
Yes.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.200
What's with me?

00:06.200 --> 00:07.200
I killed a man.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.460
I bludgeoned him
with his own skillet.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.060
There are only two “get out of
jail free” cards in the game,

00:12.100 --> 00:13.360
and you've used them both up.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.260
You know what you are?

00:14.300 --> 00:15.760
–A hoot.
–With a capital “h”,

00:15.800 --> 00:16.660
that's what you are.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.600
–My friend—
–I <i>am not</i> your friend.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.960
You and me on a road trip…

00:21.000 --> 00:23.400
–A dude ranch.
–A dude ranch?

00:23.400 --> 00:26.200
It's horses and—and sheep.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.100
We'll have campfires and
marshmallows and tents and…

00:30.300 --> 00:31.800
sheep.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.200
All right. Be honest.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.760
Have you ever ridden
a horse before?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.060
Of course I have. Why?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.560
You look a little stiff.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.560
You know what? Don't worry
about me, Denny. I've ridden plenty.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.300
Just like riding a bike—

01:12.400 --> 01:13.600
never forget.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.660
When have you ridden a horse?

01:14.700 --> 01:15.760
–When I was a kid.
–Where?

01:15.800 --> 01:16.700
At a party.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.600
–A pony?
–No.

01:19.300 --> 01:20.700
I don't know.

01:20.900 --> 01:21.860
His name was Thunderclap.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.960
He had a hat with holes
cut out for his ears.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.260
All right, look,
we can't do this.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.760
–Why not?
–Because this is a serious dude ranch,

01:27.800 --> 01:28.900
dude.
–Well…

01:29.000 --> 01:31.700
We got a rodeo
followed by a 3-day ride

01:31.700 --> 01:33.760
and no Ritz-Carltons along the way.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.360
–What's your point?
–My point is,

01:35.400 --> 01:38.560
this is obviously the first time
you've ever mounted a proper horse.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.360
I know how to ride just fine.
Don't worry about me.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.700
Oh! Oh.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.500
Well, this is what
I call a small world,

01:45.500 --> 01:46.900
that's what this is.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.460
Look at you, Al…
–Oh, jeez.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.960
Snuggling up to your horse
like two peas in a pod.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Am I right, Denny?
Whoo-ee! Ride 'em, cowboy.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.560
To each his own,
that's what I say.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.360
Who is this guy?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.660
Melvin Palmer. I don't
believe we've actually met.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.600
A pleasure. I am a big fan.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.760
Al and I go way back,
that's what we do.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.400
Hey, we need to be bunkies,
that's what we need to do.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.860
Home on the range,
where the deer,

02:07.900 --> 02:10.060
the antelope and
the three of us play.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.360
This is gonna be a hoot.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.000
I want to go home.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.500
Whoa!

02:14.800 --> 02:18.500
Boston Legal 5×06

02:50.400 --> 02:52.000
I asked for Alan.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.400
He's out of state.
You get me.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.000
What did you do?

02:57.900 --> 02:58.700
Well,

02:58.800 --> 03:02.700
I was a victim of terrible
malpractice if you must know.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.500
And I took issue
with the doctor.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.000
You took issue
with the doctor how?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.800
I blew him up.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.700
I didn't <i>mean</i> to.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.760
I only meant to set fire
to his office.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.160
How would I know
he'd run back inside?

03:16.200 --> 03:18.800
So basically,
you committed murder.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.260
Well, aren't you
a defendant's dream?

03:21.300 --> 03:23.100
My God, Catherine.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.500
Look, honey,
the doctor didn't die.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.000
In fact, he was only
barely hurt.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.500
Uh, so I'm only charged
with attempted murder.

03:31.700 --> 03:35.460
I'm sure you'll do fine,
but you won't be as good as Alan.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.700
Why don't you
tell me what went down?

03:38.700 --> 03:41.600
What exactly was his malpractice?

03:41.700 --> 03:44.200
Well, I have some kidney issues,

03:44.200 --> 03:46.400
and I became anæmic.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.060
The doctor put me on a drug

03:48.100 --> 03:50.960
that caused me to have
a small heart attack.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.200
I'm fine now,
but I could've died.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.900
Then I come to find out

03:56.000 --> 04:00.300
this doctor is taking kickbacks
from the maker of the drug.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.006
That's when I decided
to torch his office

04:03.300 --> 04:06.800
and inadvertently blew him up.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.860
I've already been arraigned,

04:08.900 --> 04:11.160
so you needn't
bother with the trivial.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.100
Let's just go to trial.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.400
And I'd like a speedy one.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.300
After all, I'm old.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.500
As are you, dear.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.400
She handled her own arraignment.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.760
Evideny, she's gotten quite comfortable
with the judicial process.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.060
What will be your
defense, revenge?

04:29.100 --> 04:30.600
Temporary insanity.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.800
It's my only choice.
Plus, she is nuts.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.200
Katie.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.860
I need you to do some checking
for me on a doctor.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.660
Also, I need a little background
on a drug called axelogen.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.900
–Okay.
–And then there's a—

04:47.400 --> 04:48.460
I'm terribly sorry.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.060
My computer calendar is off.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.300
It indicated Halloween
was today. I apologize.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.860
I'm headed home to change.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.400
It won't happen again.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.200
Balls, balls, balls.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.560
I get one of those damn little smartphones
'cause supposedly, they do everything—

05:15.600 --> 05:17.860
music, daily planner, e-mail, text—

05:17.900 --> 05:19.560
but ask it to keep track
of the damn date?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.460
I guess that's too much.
You like my outfit?

05:21.500 --> 05:22.560
It's not Halloween,

05:22.600 --> 05:25.260
and I would have to be seen
by Shirley and Sack.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.560
Balls, balls, balls!

05:26.600 --> 05:29.060
If it's any consolation,
I think you look lovely.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.600
It's not funny.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.900
Carl.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.400
Bo.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.060
Jerry, you've made rather
a point of saying that

05:40.100 --> 05:41.660
this is the year
that you will make partner.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.260
There are many ways of
getting that job done, Jerry.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.700
Prancing around the office
as little Bo Peep…

05:47.700 --> 05:50.200
is not one of the better ones.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.200
Won't happen again.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.600
Uh, this is a-a very
grown-up place, Jerry.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.700
Halloween is a kids' thing.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.060
I actually arrived
before the fire department.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.060
And, sir, what possessed you
to enter the building?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.460
Well, the fire looked
fairly small when I got there…

06:17.500 --> 06:19.460
and I thought
I could rescue my files.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.612
And the woman who set this fire,

06:21.700 --> 06:22.860
she was your patient?

06:22.900 --> 06:23.900
Yes.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.060
And what were you
treating her for?

06:26.100 --> 06:28.000
She has some kidney disease

06:28.000 --> 06:30.760
for which she gets
occasional dialysis treatments.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.460
She was suffering from some anæmia,
so I put her on axelogen.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.560
And that was for the anæmia?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.976
Yes. At first,
it worked quite well.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.060
She then suffered
the heart attack.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.360
That was unfortunate,
but it was also unforeseeable.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.760
Sometimes there are side effects
that you just can't anticipate,

06:46.800 --> 06:48.912
especially with
these new drugs.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.700
Sweet.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.300
Are you my mount?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.100
What did you just say?

06:59.100 --> 07:01.560
I'm at a dude ranch, dude.
It's not like I can be choosy.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.760
Besides, all the sheep
are spoken for. I checked.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.200
Excuse me.
This is my wife here.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.100
Really? Okay.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.160
You must want me.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.760
–What's going on here?
–What's going on is that

07:10.800 --> 07:13.260
this man is making a
sexual advance on my wife.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.460
She is <i>nasty.</i>

07:14.500 --> 07:15.300
Excuse me?

07:15.300 --> 07:16.900
In a slutty sort of way.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.960
–Oh, my God.
–I paid a lot of money

07:18.000 --> 07:20.060
for this vacation.
–And I'm trying to show her a good time.

07:20.100 --> 07:20.960
Did you hear this?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.860
Did you hear what this disgusting
person just said to my wife?

07:23.900 --> 07:25.800
Go get your horse.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.600
Fine.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.800
My God.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.400
What a thing.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
What a thing.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.642
It's terrible to
have a heart attack.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.000
Have you had one?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.500
–Not yet.
–Oh.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.300
Something I wouldn't wish on anybody.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.900
Well…

07:48.600 --> 07:51.160
Catherine, at the time
the drug was considered safe.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.100
By who? The manufacturer and him.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.460
And he was on the take.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.600
–Objection.
–Sustained.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
Oh, do you realize,
doctors also get rebates?

08:01.900 --> 08:04.460
That's in addition to the
little stipend under the table.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.960
Objection.
Nothing is done under the table.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.300
How do the rebates work,
Catherine? If you know.

08:10.300 --> 08:14.560
Well, the doctor buys the drug directly
from the pharmaceutical company.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.060
They give a rebate based on
the amount the doctor purchases.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.800
Then the doctor sells it
to the patient—

08:20.800 --> 08:23.044
no discount to reflect
the rebate—

08:23.200 --> 08:27.500
and is reimbursed by either
Medicare or private insurance.

08:27.500 --> 08:32.000
So he's making a cash windfall
every time he prescribes the drug.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.299
The fix is in.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.299
–Objection.
–Sustained.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.760
These doctors
are bought and paid for.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.000
Strike that.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.799
And sometimes,
so are the judges.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.600
Oh, not you, of course.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.000
The other campers voted
to send you both home.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.900
–What? Why?
–Why?

08:55.900 --> 08:58.860
Because he made an unwanted
sexual advance on my wife.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.460
Not in the spirit of things.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.460
Now many of us paid a lot of
money for a wonderful escape,

09:03.500 --> 09:04.660
the trip of a lifetime.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.060
Irene didn't seem to mind.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.160
Did you hear what he just said?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.600
–Sir—
–You,

09:08.700 --> 09:10.560
don't talk to me.
–What did I do?

09:10.600 --> 09:12.260
He's just a hoot,
that's what he is.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.960
He's a troublemaker—
not in the spirit.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.660
Look, it's not that I wouldn't love to
leave this flea-infested paradise—

09:17.700 --> 09:20.460
By the way, the brochure
never said the ranch included him.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.400
Hooter.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.900
Oh, my God.
He fondled my buttocks.

09:23.900 --> 09:24.900
What⁈

09:25.000 --> 09:25.900
Now listen,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.960
I'm gonna give the two of you
one last warning.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
You play by my rules,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.260
or I send you packing.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.200
Oh.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.360
I paid a lot of money for
an experience of a lifetime here.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.600
Get 'em out of here.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.560
Denny, you promised
this would be fun.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.900
I'm having fun.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.400
This is a blast,
that's what this is…

09:47.000 --> 09:48.600
hoot.

09:56.900 --> 09:57.900
Carl.

09:57.900 --> 09:58.900
Katie.

09:59.100 --> 10:02.136
So tell me, Carl,
do you have Halloween plans?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.700
Oh, that's right.
It's a kids' thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.800
Were you always…

10:07.900 --> 10:09.700
how you are now, Carl?

10:09.700 --> 10:10.900
How I am now?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.400
You know, so proper and…

10:13.700 --> 10:14.900
behaved and…

10:16.100 --> 10:17.800
And what?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.000
Go ahead.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.160
Take your best shot.
I'm a big boy.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.800
You're not, actually.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.100
I'd say you're a big grown-up.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.000
It's a pity.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.660
Oh, I wish you'd waited
till I got back, Shirley.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.960
Well, make sure
you talk to the drug rep

10:38.000 --> 10:40.400
from the pharmaceutical company.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.260
You—you might even want
to put him on the stand.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.500
Excuse me.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.860
No phone calls allowed.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.400
I have an emergency

10:46.400 --> 10:48.260
We all have our offices.
We all have our little crises.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.412
Do you see any of us on a phone?

10:50.600 --> 10:51.660
He's not in the spirit again.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.060
Could you just go off and
work with your dialect coach?

10:54.100 --> 10:55.160
Did you hear that?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.960
–Oh, leave him alone, Ian.
–What a thing.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.960
What, are you taking his side?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.560
You promised you
wouldn't be getting upset.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.860
Well, now her vacation's ruined.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.260
I don't know why you put up with him, Irene.
–Nobody was talking to you.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.560
You've done nothing
but talk about me.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.460
Because you've done nothing
but cause trouble.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.160
You're an extra.
You don't get to talk.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.800
Oh, my God.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.700
Mr Rudeness—
that's what you are.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.000
–Oh, my God!
–Hey.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.260
What kind of example is that,
shooting a gun?

11:19.300 --> 11:21.260
That's a terrible example to set.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.800
Oh, my God.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.500
Hey!
Aah!

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
Again!

11:27.600 --> 11:30.160
I've about had it with you.
You understand?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.660
Why does nobody like me?

11:31.700 --> 11:32.760
I like you, bunkie.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.160
You just stick close to me
for the rest of the trip.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.060
My God. That one's
a homosexual.

11:37.100 --> 11:37.800
Ian.

11:37.900 --> 11:40.260
Supposed to be the trip of a lifetime,
and now we have a homosexual.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.060
It's a “don't ask,
don't tell” dude ranch.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.260
Surely you knew that, Ian.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.460
The one in the middle's a masher,

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
you're rude, and he's gay,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.160
and all three are from Boston.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.660
All right, buddy. I'm gon'
take you out behind this…

11:50.700 --> 11:52.614
I'm calling it like I see it.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.860
I think she felt so violated
after the heart attack and angry

12:09.900 --> 12:13.000
that she went into a mild
dissociative state.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.360
What does that mean?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.560
It means, basically,
that she snapped.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.000
She was so blinded
by rage and fear,

12:19.100 --> 12:20.600
she lost herself.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.792
In my opinion, she was not capable
of forming a mental intent.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.160
Are you getting paid
for this testimony?

12:26.200 --> 12:28.500
–Objection.
–Overruled.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.360
Are you getting paid?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.842
I'm compensated
for my services, yes.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.200
How much for today?

12:33.200 --> 12:35.000
$10,000.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.460
So she snapped, lit a fire,
but now she's sane again.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.700
Is that about it?

12:39.700 --> 12:42.200
I believe she's sane again, yes.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.600
Got it.

13:35.300 --> 13:38.600
♫ Michael, row your boat ashore ♫

13:38.600 --> 13:42.100
♫ hallelujah ♫

13:42.100 --> 13:45.500
♫ Michael, row your boat ashore ♫

13:45.500 --> 13:48.900
♫ hallelujah ♫

13:48.900 --> 13:52.300
♫ sister, help to trim the sails ♫

13:52.300 --> 13:55.800
♫ hallelujah ♫

13:55.800 --> 13:57.960
♫ sister, help to trim the sails… ♫

13:58.000 --> 14:00.060
I can't believe
you got me into this.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.160
Me? It was your idea.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.560
My idea was to take
a trip, not do this.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.200
Adjust your attitude.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.800
Look.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.400
I think Irene likes me.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.300
♫… home on the other side ♫

14:13.300 --> 14:17.300
♫ hallelujah ♫

14:18.400 --> 14:20.900
Hey! All right!

14:21.000 --> 14:21.900
Very nice.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.700
Um… okay, Ian,
you got a request?

14:24.700 --> 14:27.960
Yes, um, could you please
put the cigar out, please?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.860
You know, it causes
cancer, and— and I—

14:29.900 --> 14:33.600
I'm here for a wonderful
vacation escape, not cancer.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.300
It keeps the bugs away.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.100
If only it worked on pests.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.060
That's a put-down.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.060
–Ian, for God—
–No, no, never mind, Irene.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.760
That was a total put-down.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.600
Oh, come on. It was just a…

14:44.200 --> 14:45.360
Put your foot down, man.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.500
Everybody, quiet!

14:48.600 --> 14:52.200
Damn it. This is supposed
to be a joyful sing-along

14:52.200 --> 14:54.100
where we all bar

14:54.100 --> 14:56.560
I have a problem.
These aren't even cowboy songs.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.860
I paid a lot of money
for the experience of a lifetime, too.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.460
I expected to hear cowboy songs.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.060
How about “surrey with
the fringe on top”?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.660
Or “sweet betsy from pike”?

15:05.700 --> 15:06.860
“Michael, row your boat ashore”

15:06.900 --> 15:10.160
is a religious song with
a nautical theme for the kids.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.260
Next we'll have Irene here
singing in tongues.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.360
–Excuse me⁈
–I don't want

15:13.400 --> 15:15.760
my wife's name
out of your dirty mouth.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.900
Do you hear me?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.400
Whoa.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.800
Would you please…

15:21.900 --> 15:24.000
Hey, I got a cowboy song.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.400
Pass me that guitar, sport.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.600
You know I am
a get-along kind of guy

15:30.600 --> 15:31.900
that's what I am.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.800
And in the spirit of us <i>all</i>
gettin' along here,

15:35.800 --> 15:38.560
I'm gonna dedicate this
little number to my buddies

15:38.600 --> 15:41.400
Alan and Denny.

15:46.100 --> 15:49.300
♫ as I walked out ♫

15:49.300 --> 15:52.300
♫ in the streets of Laredo ♫

15:52.300 --> 15:54.400
♫ as I walked out ♫

15:54.400 --> 15:57.700
♫ in Laredo one day ♫

15:57.700 --> 16:00.700
♫ I spied a young cowboy ♫

16:00.700 --> 16:03.800
♫ all dressed in white linen ♫

16:03.900 --> 16:06.200
♫ wrapped in white linen ♫

16:06.200 --> 16:09.600
♫ as cold as the clay ♫

16:10.500 --> 16:13.800
♫ I see by your outfit ♫

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
♫ that you are a cowboy ♫

16:16.800 --> 16:19.600
♫ I see by your outfit ♫

16:19.600 --> 16:22.200
♫ that you are one, too ♫

16:22.200 --> 16:25.400
♫ we see by your outfits ♫

16:25.400 --> 16:28.300
♫ that you are both cowboys ♫

16:28.300 --> 16:30.900
♫ if we get some outfits ♫

16:30.900 --> 16:34.700
♫ we can be cowboys, too ♫

16:37.000 --> 16:38.560
They're making fun of us.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
I heard it.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.160
That was a Smothers brothers' bit.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.560
You know, I didn't like that song.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.060
We went to a lot of trouble
to get just the right outfits,

16:45.100 --> 16:46.160
and we quite like them.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.060
That song wasn't
in the spirit, Melvin.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.160
Well, good buddy,

16:49.200 --> 16:52.500
most hats don't
come with on/off buttons.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.460
Turn your hats on, Al, Denny.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.560
Let the group see.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.860
There's nothing wrong with a hat

16:56.900 --> 16:59.560
be used as a light source
in case of emergency.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.800
No doubt. Turn 'em on.
Let us have a look.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.900
–What?
–They're just jealous.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.571
Come on, Denny.
Let's go back to the tent.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.668
Do you think there are
mountain lions out there…

17:49.800 --> 17:51.200
or wolves?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.500
Could be.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.560
Denny, I really
want to go home.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.360
Can we please go home
in the morning?

17:57.400 --> 18:00.100
–It's our first day.
–I don't care.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.460
I don't like
pooping in the woods.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.560
I may have wiped myself
with poison oak.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.382
And I don't like the group.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.166
It reminds me when I was little
and kids were mean.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.160
I was bullied
as a child, you know?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.160
Alan, I gotta
tell you something,

18:15.200 --> 18:16.660
and I don't want you
to take it personally.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.260
Promise me you won't
take it personally.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.100
Ok, what?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.360
I-I have an erection.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.100
Oh!

18:23.100 --> 18:26.060
It has nothing to do
with you personally. I swear.

18:26.100 --> 18:26.660
I've had it all day,

18:26.700 --> 18:29.660
ever since I took the viagra
thinking it was my hay fever pills.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.812
And I-I think I got one of those

18:32.900 --> 18:34.500
priapism things.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.700
–That can be dangerous.
–I know.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.860
What if the group finds out?

18:39.900 --> 18:41.760
Alan, would you take a look?
Because—

18:41.800 --> 18:42.900
Absolutely not.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.000
–Alan—
–No.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.760
Well, what am I gonna do?

18:45.800 --> 18:47.200
Plus, I gotta pee,

18:47.400 --> 18:48.660
which is almost impossible when—

18:48.700 --> 18:52.000
We are going home
first thing in the morning.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.200
What was that?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.100
Something's out there.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.400
Hello?

19:07.300 --> 19:08.800
Hello.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.100
Go out and look.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.842
–You go.
–No, you have to pee anyway.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.200
There.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.100
It's just a sheep.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.900
Are they vicious,
the wild ones?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.900
I don't think so.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.660
I'm gonna go try and pee.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.400
Hurry.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.000
Get back in this tent.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.100
What?

20:03.135 --> 20:06.500
Don't even think of it.
Just… get back here.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.100
I think she loves me.

20:08.135 --> 20:09.800
Never mind.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.100
That's me, in college.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.500
And… here, here.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.860
That's me in high school.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.200
I was wild.

20:30.235 --> 20:32.660
My parents thought I was
a problem, all right?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.200
I was plenty wild.

20:34.235 --> 20:36.095
My goodness.
Who is this person?

20:36.135 --> 20:39.105
So don't pity me.
I was once very much a kid.

20:39.135 --> 20:40.895
I-I never meant to
imply that you weren't.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.795
I was simply pitying the fact
that you no longer are.

20:43.835 --> 20:46.060
They—they say we were
happiest as children,

20:46.100 --> 20:48.500
and those most happy in adulthood

20:48.535 --> 20:51.460
are the ones who never
let die the child within.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.760
There are plenty of proper lawyers
who dress up on Halloween…

20:54.800 --> 20:57.400
or who wear hula skirts in Hawaii.

20:57.500 --> 21:01.160
Denny and Alan are off somewhere
pretending to be cowboys…

21:01.200 --> 21:04.698
but that sort of nonsense
doesn't work for Carl Sack.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.300
That's not him.

21:06.500 --> 21:10.500
Perhaps someone he used
to be, but not anymore.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.900
Most certainly not.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.895
Don't take it personally, Carl.

21:17.935 --> 21:20.300
Oh, how can I not, Shirley?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.895
It wasn't a professional criticism.

21:21.935 --> 21:23.600
It was personal.

21:23.635 --> 21:26.095
Actually, I wouldn't mind a
professional critique once in a while,

21:26.135 --> 21:27.400
but…

21:27.800 --> 21:30.400
well, personally,
I consider myself..

21:30.500 --> 21:31.900
professional.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.700
What—don't bite your lip.

21:33.735 --> 21:35.295
I don't like it
when you bite your lip.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.595
How about I bite yours?

21:36.635 --> 21:37.895
Oh, you're handling me now.

21:37.935 --> 21:39.400
–Yes, I am.
–Mm.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.400
–In the office.
–I know.

21:41.435 --> 21:42.395
I'm not a fuddy-duddy.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.500
Yes, you are,
a little one.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.095
It doesn't matter.
I like fuddy-duddies.

21:47.135 --> 21:49.200
And hey, should McCain get in,

21:49.235 --> 21:51.695
we'd actually have
a fuddy-duddy in chief.

21:51.735 --> 21:53.700
Oh. Elmer Fuddy-duddy.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.480
–Let's go to dinner.
–I can't.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.600
I have to work on my closing.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.095
Lord knows what I'm gonna say.

22:01.135 --> 22:04.200
She practically blew up her doctor.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.595
You sound a little dismissive.

22:05.635 --> 22:09.600
Well, if you knew
this crazy Catherine Piper…

22:11.000 --> 22:13.800
Did I ever tell you
how my mother died?

22:14.000 --> 22:18.224
New blood thinner medication,
which, when combined with aspirin,

22:18.300 --> 22:21.200
caused her to bleed out
through an ulcer.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.095
Turns out her doctor,
who prescribed the medication,

22:24.135 --> 22:27.500
was a paid consultant
for the drug company.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.460
But you don't think doctors
are on the take, do you?

22:30.500 --> 22:33.560
I think they prescribe
drugs they think are safe.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.695
But, I mean, let's face it,

22:34.735 --> 22:38.695
with the rising malpractice premiums,
lower HMO reimbursements,

22:38.735 --> 22:41.595
many doctors can't even afford
to practice these days

22:41.635 --> 22:45.300
without pharmaceutical
consulting grants.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.700
And with those grants…

22:48.100 --> 22:51.500
comes a loss of objectivity.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.695
Did this doctor at least
tell this crazy Catherine Piper

22:54.735 --> 22:57.507
that he was on
the drug company's payroll?

22:57.600 --> 22:59.000
No.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.500
Hmm.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.900
Hello.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.500
Denny. Denny!

23:19.900 --> 23:20.900
Where are you?

23:20.935 --> 23:22.400
I'm trapped.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.595
You gotta come and help me.

23:24.635 --> 23:26.000
Trapped?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.995
Where? <i>What's going on?</i>

23:28.035 --> 23:30.000
In Hoberinn's tent.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.900
I came to visit Irene.

23:31.935 --> 23:33.500
–What?
–Shh.

23:33.535 --> 23:36.700
I fell asleep after.
Now Irene's gone.

23:36.735 --> 23:39.500
<i>And Ian's passed out
on top of me.</i>

23:39.535 --> 23:41.000
I can't move.

23:41.035 --> 23:42.495
You've gotta be kidding me.

23:42.535 --> 23:45.800
Get over here
and help get me free

23:45.900 --> 23:47.300
before he wakes up.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.000
–Where's Irene?
<i>–I don't know.</i>

23:50.035 --> 23:53.700
Just get over here. <i>Hurry.</i>

23:57.800 --> 23:59.700
Which tent are you—

24:00.100 --> 24:01.500
Never mind.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.700
I think I know.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.600
Oh, my.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.200
See if you can get his leg off.

24:13.300 --> 24:13.995
Where's Irene?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.660
Would you forget about Irene?

24:15.700 --> 24:18.300
Mm. Mm.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.400
Hurry!

24:25.435 --> 24:27.200
Don't rush me.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.800
Get his arm.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.800
This won't be easy.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.300
Aah!

25:05.335 --> 25:11.300
–Aah!
–Aah!

25:22.000 --> 25:25.095
I still don't understand.
Where exactly was Irene?

25:25.135 --> 25:26.500
She went out to pee.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.660
Then Ian came in drunk, crashed.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.100
Let's get outta here.

25:30.135 --> 25:32.595
Maybe we can get back
in time for Halloween.

25:32.635 --> 25:34.400
We could go as cowboys.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.095
And where do you think you're goin'?

25:36.135 --> 25:38.500
We're gettin' the hell outta dodge.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.900
What's with the rifle?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.800
You have to marry Irene,

25:43.900 --> 25:47.100
or the sheep or the captain
of the hockey team.

25:47.135 --> 25:48.495
You think you're funny.

25:48.535 --> 25:51.195
I paid a lot of money
for the trip of a lifetime.

25:51.235 --> 25:53.595
Well, you certainly got that,
didn't you, Ian?

25:53.635 --> 25:55.595
In addition to being
head of this dude ranch,

25:55.635 --> 25:58.000
I'm a volunteer constable sheriff.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.000
Good for you.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.795
I'm placing you under arrest.

26:00.835 --> 26:01.900
Arrest?

26:02.100 --> 26:02.700
For what?

26:02.735 --> 26:04.795
Adultery is a crime
in the state of Utah,

26:04.835 --> 26:07.460
as is fornication out of wedlock.
–Very funny.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.995
–You have the right to remain silent—
–You must be joking.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.895
And you're under arrest, too.

26:11.935 --> 26:12.900
Me? For what?

26:12.935 --> 26:14.695
Conspiracy to commit adultery,

26:14.735 --> 26:17.595
aiding and abetting
an adulterer and a fornicator.

26:17.635 --> 26:19.860
Now you have the experience
of a lifetime, don't you,

26:19.900 --> 26:22.600
Mr Boston, Mr Red Sox fan,

26:22.700 --> 26:25.495
Mr aider and abetter
from the evil Red Sox nation?

26:25.535 --> 26:27.119
All right. That does it.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.795
–Oh, for God's sake.
–Ian!

26:28.835 --> 26:29.695
–Denny.
–It's a—

26:29.735 --> 26:31.495
It's a tranq gun.
He'll sleep it off.

26:31.535 --> 26:34.600
Put down your weapon now, sir.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.800
Whether the doctor
made a mistake or not,

26:48.100 --> 26:51.560
that doesn't give her the right
to set fire to his office.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.995
Oh, sure. They put up
a hired gun expert to claim

26:54.035 --> 26:56.060
that she was temporarily insane.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.500
“dissociative state,”

26:57.535 --> 26:59.460
couldn't distinguish
right from wrong,

26:59.500 --> 27:02.400
not capable of forming
mental intent—

27:02.435 --> 27:04.217
all the technical buzzwords

27:04.235 --> 27:06.600
to allow you to free

27:06.700 --> 27:08.900
a sweet old lady.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.600
But you all know what happened.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.400
She got mad…

27:14.800 --> 27:16.600
and got even.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.995
You know the death grip
the pharmaceutical industry

27:21.035 --> 27:22.295
has on this country.

27:22.335 --> 27:24.800
They've infiltrated the FDA.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.095
A study showed that

27:26.135 --> 27:29.500
90% of all FDA advisory meetings

27:29.535 --> 27:32.895
had at least one person
with ties to big pharmigeutical,

27:32.935 --> 27:34.900
and then there's Congress.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
Big pharma gave members of
Congress $70 million since 1990.

27:40.035 --> 27:43.095
So who does that leave us
with but our doctors?

27:43.135 --> 27:45.500
And even they're being bought.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.100
Between consulting fees and rebates,

27:48.135 --> 27:51.395
doctors get hundreds of millions
of dollars every year,

27:51.435 --> 27:53.295
and my God, look what's happening.

27:53.335 --> 27:56.400
Drugs are being prescribed like candy.

27:56.435 --> 27:58.900
A famed Harvard psychiatrist—

27:58.935 --> 28:03.300
he helped fuel the recent boom
in antipsychotics for kids—

28:03.400 --> 28:07.558
turns out he personally took
over $1.6 million from drug makers

28:08.700 --> 28:10.700
over the past seven years.

28:10.735 --> 28:11.300
Um,

28:11.335 --> 28:15.757
he also failed to report this income
to the university, by the way.

28:16.300 --> 28:17.700
How can this be?

28:17.800 --> 28:22.100
We have no regulations,
no disclosure procedures in place.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.700
Nothing to ensure

28:23.735 --> 28:26.100
that we the patients can know

28:26.135 --> 28:29.100
whether our doctor
is on the take.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.600
How can this be?

28:31.700 --> 28:34.010
Catherine Piper
had a heart attack.

28:34.035 --> 28:35.900
She almost died.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.195
An unsafe drug was rushed
to the market.

28:38.235 --> 28:41.100
It was prescribed
by her own physician,

28:41.200 --> 28:45.200
perhaps because he had
a financial incentive to do so.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.000
She nearly died.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.400
When you go back to
that room, I want you to…

28:52.700 --> 28:56.600
try to imagine what it's like
to suffer a heart attack,

28:56.635 --> 29:00.900
to be lying on your kitchen floor

29:01.000 --> 29:04.100
with no one around,
thinking…

29:04.300 --> 29:06.400
“this is it.”

29:07.400 --> 29:10.700
It may not even possible
to imagine that.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.600
But then…

29:12.700 --> 29:14.000
she found out

29:14.035 --> 29:18.000
that the person she
perhaps trusted the most

29:18.100 --> 29:20.200
did this to her.

29:20.900 --> 29:23.400
It made her crazy.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.600
Wouldn't it you?

29:47.500 --> 29:48.600
Jerry?

29:48.700 --> 29:50.300
Katie.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.200
You have a paper bag
over your head.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.800
I do.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.100
Could you tell me why?

29:57.800 --> 30:00.500
I was looking to crawl
under a big rock.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.095
There were none available.

30:02.135 --> 30:04.195
The reason you wanted to
crawl under a big rock?

30:04.235 --> 30:08.200
I passed three partners today
who called me Bo.

30:08.235 --> 30:11.000
A fourth referred to me
as the peepster.

30:11.035 --> 30:14.095
Evidently I was seen dressed
for Halloween prematurely.

30:14.135 --> 30:15.195
And this is tragic?

30:15.235 --> 30:17.700
It is if one wants
to make partner.

30:17.735 --> 30:19.600
And if those same partners

30:19.635 --> 30:22.560
were to catch a glance of you
with a paper bag on your head?

30:22.600 --> 30:23.695
The damage is done.

30:23.735 --> 30:25.260
Jerry, take the bag off.

30:25.300 --> 30:28.560
You'll likely breathe in your own
carbon dioxide. It's not healthy.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.000
Take it off.

30:30.300 --> 30:31.900
Oh.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.260
Do you know what happens to lawyers
who make partner, Jerry?

30:37.300 --> 30:39.600
They become locked in, lifers.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.460
I'm not sure that's
something you want.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.495
Plus, there's rumors concerning
the firm's financial health.

30:44.535 --> 30:46.395
We represent a lot of
mortgage lenders.

30:46.435 --> 30:49.195
Partners don't just get the fruits.
They get all the liabilities.

30:49.235 --> 30:54.300
It's just, for seven years,
I've chased this particular carrot.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.900
Didn't get it.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.100
Now I'm up again.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.195
If I blow it—
–This is <i>that</i> important?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.800
Yes.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.538
Well, if my opinion counts
for anything, I…

31:07.600 --> 31:10.570
I thought you made
a perfectly fab lady Peep.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.000
What's wrong?

31:27.900 --> 31:29.900
They were arrested.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.500
–Who?
–Denny and Alan.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.500
For what?

31:35.535 --> 31:38.400
Ah, it seems Denny
committed adultery,

31:38.435 --> 31:41.300
which evidently
can be prosecuted in…

31:41.500 --> 31:42.895
I don't know what Alan did.

31:42.935 --> 31:43.795
They're being arraigned
in the morning.

31:43.835 --> 31:47.069
Can't they go to a stupid dude
ranch without get—

31:48.200 --> 31:50.395
Boy, you just find everything
funny these days—

31:50.435 --> 31:52.595
I'm—I'm sorry. I don't know
what happened there.

31:52.635 --> 31:53.700
Yes, you do.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.800
Denny did something crazy.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.895
Last week, he bet on a case.

31:57.935 --> 32:00.995
The week before that, he had his
penis hooked up to a monitor.

32:01.035 --> 32:02.895
It was cock-a-doodle-doing
in a courtroom.

32:02.935 --> 32:05.707
I mean, it's just
one thing after another.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.095
Hey… and I'm not being
Elmer Fuddy, Shirley.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.000
The man is losing his mind.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.295
We all know it.
We laugh it off.

32:12.335 --> 32:15.600
We say, “isn't the mad cow cute?”

32:16.900 --> 32:19.474
At what point does it
stop being funny?

32:19.700 --> 32:23.700
At what point do we all
admit the man needs help?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.900
Case number 4-2-1-2.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.100
State of Utah vs Denny Crane,

32:36.200 --> 32:37.795
on the charge of adultery,

32:37.835 --> 32:39.795
conspiracy to commit—
–Alan Shore for the defendant,

32:39.835 --> 32:40.600
your honor.

32:40.635 --> 32:42.695
We waive reading,
and plead not guilty

32:42.735 --> 32:43.995
and ask for immediate extradition

32:44.035 --> 32:46.495
to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
or any jurisdiction

32:46.535 --> 32:48.895
where the criminal justice code
isn't written in the good book.

32:48.935 --> 32:49.895
Hold on. Wait a sec.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.849
He's a defendant, too, judge.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.195
Yes, I am, your honor.

32:53.235 --> 32:55.595
Mr Crane would be
your adulterer and fornicator.

32:55.635 --> 32:57.095
I would be your aider and abetter.

32:57.135 --> 32:59.895
I'm not quite sure
how Irene escaped charges

32:59.935 --> 33:03.960
since adulterating and fornicating
is traditionally done in tandem.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.995
Mr Shore, defendants do not
speak in my courtroom.

33:07.035 --> 33:07.800
Ah.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.595
So that little right
to confront one's accuser?

33:10.635 --> 33:12.600
How's that done,
on the web?

33:12.700 --> 33:13.995
If you cannot afford counsel,

33:14.035 --> 33:15.195
one will—
–I can. I'm rich.

33:15.235 --> 33:17.095
Actually, Denny and I
flew here private.

33:17.135 --> 33:21.160
We can afford the best attorneys
and sometimes judges that money can buy.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.195
I'll represent myself,

33:22.235 --> 33:24.395
and let me just toss out
as an ice breaker,

33:24.435 --> 33:27.395
Utah is not the state that
wants to prosecute adultery.

33:27.435 --> 33:31.095
While it may technically be a crime,
so's polygamy, which you don't prosecute.

33:31.135 --> 33:34.060
I'm sure I'll get letters
for saying so, but you don't.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.595
I seem to be getting a lot of
gavel whacks. Is it just me?

33:36.635 --> 33:39.495
Your own attorney general,
uh, went on record as saying

33:39.535 --> 33:41.895
you lack the resources to
go after all the polygamists.

33:41.935 --> 33:43.695
Let's face it,
you've got a lot of them.

33:43.735 --> 33:45.495
Not a judgment.
Personally, I'm a fan.

33:45.535 --> 33:48.795
So's Denny. He's had six wives.
Is it six or seven?

33:48.835 --> 33:51.013
The former head
of N.O.W in Utah—

33:51.035 --> 33:54.595
I love that the national organization
of women actually has a chapter in Utah—

33:54.635 --> 33:57.300
anyway, she said the antipolygamy law

33:57.335 --> 34:00.095
has become as irrelevant as
the spitting-on-the-sidewalk ordinance.

34:00.135 --> 34:02.295
Now I know how we all
love to spit in Utah.

34:02.335 --> 34:05.795
You look like a lougie hacker
from way back. Send those letters.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.895
I even find polygamy funny,
just a little—

34:07.935 --> 34:10.795
these loser guys with
all these women, the hairdos.

34:10.835 --> 34:14.159
Unfortunately, in many cases,
there's child abuse involved.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.594
Whack away, but if you're
going to ignore child abusers

34:16.635 --> 34:18.995
and come after me for
aiding and abetting adultery,

34:19.034 --> 34:21.094
well, all I can say is,
take your shot.

34:21.135 --> 34:23.195
Please. I beg you.
Take your shot.

34:23.235 --> 34:26.733
Mr Shore, are you threatening
the good state of Utah?

34:26.735 --> 34:28.695
You're a quick study. I can
see why they made you judge.

34:28.735 --> 34:29.895
That's exactly what I'm doing.

34:29.935 --> 34:33.094
I'm ready to take on the state,
Mr Constable with the rifle there,

34:33.135 --> 34:35.594
and you, and everyone you're
married to, let the fun begin.

34:35.635 --> 34:37.699
Oh, it will be fun,
but first,

34:37.800 --> 34:40.195
I don't let people represent
themselves in my courtroom,

34:40.235 --> 34:42.094
so the first thing
we're going to do

34:42.135 --> 34:44.699
is get you an independent lawyer.

34:44.735 --> 34:48.300
Judge, I'll represent
the Hoot brothers.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.695
Oh, no. I'm not gonna
be defended by him

34:50.735 --> 34:53.395
or any other clown—
–I was there, judge.

34:53.435 --> 34:55.594
I could be a witness,
in fact— your call—

34:55.635 --> 34:57.595
but either way,
I could tell you a few things

34:57.635 --> 35:00.500
about Mr Shore and Mr Crane.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.200
Shall we go to chambers?

35:02.235 --> 35:03.795
–Let's go.
–Wait a second.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.095
If you're gonna have
an ex-parte meeting,

35:05.135 --> 35:06.595
we have a right to be present.

35:06.635 --> 35:09.195
Fine. But you keep
your mouth absolutely shut.

35:09.235 --> 35:11.200
One word, and you're out.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.495
What the hell are you doing?

35:12.535 --> 35:14.395
Just do as the judge says, Al.

35:14.435 --> 35:17.900
For once in your life,
let me do the talkin'.

35:21.100 --> 35:22.295
First of all, I don't know—

35:22.335 --> 35:23.860
First of all,
you don't talk.

35:23.900 --> 35:26.800
Not a peep,
or you go to jail.

35:27.000 --> 35:27.795
Let's hear it.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.495
Judge, I'm gonna be honest.

35:29.535 --> 35:31.800
I don't like this man.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.295
The old guy I kind of enjoy.

35:33.335 --> 35:35.595
He's just an old fart
who should be retired to stud.

35:35.635 --> 35:37.600
But him? I'll tell you what,

35:37.700 --> 35:39.614
I'm from Texas, and in Texas,

35:39.635 --> 35:42.095
if somebody messes with
a man's wife, you shoot him.

35:42.135 --> 35:44.195
Hell, he steps on
your property, you shoot him.

35:44.235 --> 35:45.295
Well, let me tell you something,

35:45.335 --> 35:48.400
this guy, he wants
to stand trial here.

35:48.435 --> 35:50.695
That's why he was
baiting you like that.

35:50.735 --> 35:53.895
He gets his jollies out of
playing David against Goliath,

35:53.935 --> 35:56.060
that's what he does.
But the thing is,

35:56.100 --> 35:59.100
he wields one hell of a slingshot.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.195
He took on the entire supreme court,

36:01.235 --> 36:04.495
insulted every one of 'em,
and he won his case to boot.

36:04.535 --> 36:07.595
This man can make some
serious noise in a courtroom,

36:07.635 --> 36:09.000
and let's face it,

36:09.100 --> 36:12.500
none of us wants to see
a big flap here, do we?

36:12.600 --> 36:15.000
Prosecuting for adultery?

36:15.100 --> 36:17.195
Nobody does that,
not even Texas.

36:17.235 --> 36:19.195
You certainly don't want
to be doing that here,

36:19.235 --> 36:21.800
not with the polygamy thing going on.

36:21.835 --> 36:25.595
Polygamy is illegal in Utah,
<i>and</i> not practiced by the majority—

36:25.635 --> 36:28.300
But it goes on, judge.
It goes on.

36:28.335 --> 36:31.400
And like he said,
often with underage girls.

36:31.435 --> 36:33.019
Now Utah's a fine state—

36:33.035 --> 36:36.195
fresh air, fine people,
orrin hatch— you got it all.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.800
But this polygamy thing…

36:38.900 --> 36:41.795
he's <i>dying</i> to get his day
in your court.

36:41.835 --> 36:43.495
Don't make his day, judge.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.295
Don't give this son of
a bitch what he wants.

36:45.335 --> 36:47.195
Boot his girlie ass outta here.

36:47.235 --> 36:48.100
Otherwise

36:48.135 --> 36:52.100
you'll be spoon-feeding him
the soapbox of a lifetime.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.200
Look at the way
he's drooling already.

36:55.300 --> 36:59.200
So's the old guy,
but that's the mad cow.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.895
I'm dismissing the charges.

37:01.935 --> 37:02.900
Too bad, Al.

37:02.935 --> 37:05.895
And I'm banning the both of you
from Utah for life.

37:05.935 --> 37:08.595
What? I got rezzies at Deer
Valley. I'm already booked.

37:08.635 --> 37:10.795
You'll be booked in here
if you don't shut your mouth!

37:10.835 --> 37:12.560
Get out of here, both of you!

37:12.600 --> 37:14.900
I never want to see you again.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.982
They weren't out very long.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.360
Do you think
they considered me sane?

37:30.400 --> 37:32.908
If only they could
know you like I do.

37:32.935 --> 37:36.200
I don't think I could
handle prison, Shirley.

37:36.235 --> 37:39.260
I hear the fights in the yard
can get pretty rough.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.082
Stiff upper lip, Catherine.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.400
Will the defendant please rise?

37:43.700 --> 37:45.000
Madam foreperson,

37:45.100 --> 37:47.595
has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

37:47.635 --> 37:49.200
We have, your honor.

37:49.235 --> 37:52.895
“In the matter of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs Catherine Piper

37:52.935 --> 37:55.795
”on the charge of
attempted murder and arson,

37:55.835 --> 37:58.295
”we find the defendant
Catherine Piper

37:58.335 --> 38:01.700
not guilty by reason
of temporary insanity.”

38:01.735 --> 38:03.560
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.095
thank you for your service.
You are dismissed.

38:06.135 --> 38:07.800
This court is adjourned.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.100
Thank God they bought it.

38:10.900 --> 38:14.500
Well, I guess prison's
gonna have to wait.

38:14.900 --> 38:17.000
Well, until your next crime.

38:17.300 --> 38:19.200
Oh, thank you, Shirley.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.400
You've been almost like
a big sister to me.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I—I'm touched.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.700
Melvin Palmer—of
all people to get us off.

38:31.735 --> 38:34.095
I now have to feel
indebted to <i>him</i>.

38:34.135 --> 38:35.095
Can you imagine—

38:35.135 --> 38:36.795
–Ah, he's a good guy.
–Good guy?

38:36.835 --> 38:39.013
–I like him.
–How can you possib—

38:39.100 --> 38:40.600
Oh, my.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.400
Okay.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Let's hear it.

38:48.100 --> 38:51.300
You are so sexy.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.500
–So are you.
–Thank you, Denny.

38:53.535 --> 38:55.700
–We're off to a party.
–Really?

38:55.800 --> 38:59.295
I thought maybe Carl was
taking you to his favorite club.

38:59.335 --> 39:01.095
–Very funny.
–I'm not kidding, Carl.

39:01.135 --> 39:04.595
After a few days on a dude ranch,
you actually look good to me.

39:04.635 --> 39:06.600
Don't you agree, Denny?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.200
Denny?

39:09.300 --> 39:10.900
–Aah!
–Denny!

39:10.935 --> 39:12.900
–Denny, hey!
–What the hell?

39:12.935 --> 39:14.295
–Denny!
–What is wrong with you?

39:14.335 --> 39:15.895
Good God! Are you all right?

39:15.935 --> 39:17.651
–I think he bit me.
–What⁈

39:17.700 --> 39:20.300
Will you <i>ever</i> change?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.200
I feel a little gypped.

39:32.300 --> 39:34.400
That whole trip was just…

39:34.500 --> 39:36.100
unsatisfying.

39:36.135 --> 39:37.600
How so?

39:37.800 --> 39:39.400
I don't know.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.495
Maybe it was the stark contrast

39:44.535 --> 39:48.095
between that magnificent scenery
and those awful ranching people.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.495
Well, at least you and I got
to spend some time together.

39:50.535 --> 39:54.500
Oh, please. You only
had eyes for barnyard animals.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.795
Denny, you think I was too rough on
Utah, playing the polygamy card?

39:58.835 --> 40:02.003
It was cheap, but hey,
they came after us first.

40:02.035 --> 40:05.467
We have to take another trip.
This one didn't count.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.695
They were wrong about our outfits.

40:08.735 --> 40:10.395
–We were hot.
–We're always hot.

40:10.435 --> 40:12.000
Irene…

40:12.200 --> 40:13.395
loved me.
Could you tell?

40:13.435 --> 40:14.600
Ian didn't.

40:14.700 --> 40:15.900
No.

40:17.500 --> 40:21.200
The best sex to be had
is with the Irenes of the world.

40:21.235 --> 40:21.995
Do you know that?

40:22.035 --> 40:24.081
–I didn't, actually.
–Oh, yeah.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.160
See, the thing is,
women who look like that

40:27.200 --> 40:29.495
make love like it's the last sex
they'll ever have

40:29.535 --> 40:31.600
'cause it very well could be.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.500
What?

40:33.535 --> 40:37.000
Nothing, just absorbing
your latest pearl.

40:41.100 --> 40:46.000
You know, you look at the Ians
and the Melvin Palmers…

40:46.100 --> 40:49.600
most men are so starved
for male friendship.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.595
We're blessed, Denny.

40:51.635 --> 40:52.560
Of course we are,

40:52.600 --> 40:55.795
and I'll bet we're the only ones
who shared the same sleeping bag.

40:55.835 --> 40:56.700
Yeah.

40:56.735 --> 40:59.600
Oh, I'm sorry about the erection.

41:00.300 --> 41:03.800
I'm over it.

41:06.100 --> 41:08.395
We really are the best couple I know.

41:08.435 --> 41:12.100
Mm-hmm. <i>And</i> we only get better.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.600
We do.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.600
We do.

41:18.100 --> 41:30.000
