WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.838
Virginia? Virginia? Virginia?

00:04.872 --> 00:07.208
Guess how I got this.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.709
Ooh, I love this game!

00:08.742 --> 00:10.911
JIMMY:
"Guess how I got this"
was a game

00:10.944 --> 00:13.681
my parents had been playing
for years.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.186
Guess how I got this.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.854
Guess how I got this.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.424
(water gurgling)

00:24.525 --> 00:27.161
Guess how I got this.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.930
(groans)

00:29.963 --> 00:32.100
Guess how I got this.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.768
Mm, mm.
(gasping)

00:34.802 --> 00:37.037
JIMMY:
I don't want to brag, but I was

00:37.071 --> 00:38.872
sort of the inspiration
for this game.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.874
Guess how I got this.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.680
I'm gonna guess that Sarah
McLachlan freed all the lobsters

00:46.714 --> 00:48.048
from the Seafood
Shack again.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.383
Nope.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.219
You won a bet with
the governor of Maine.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.686
Sabrina, Main Street
doesn't have a governor.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.054
You got to think
before you guess.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.923
You know, you guys
are ruining this game.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.391
Where'd you get
the lobster, Burt?

00:57.425 --> 00:58.792
Tyler couldn't pay me
for mowing his lawn,

00:58.826 --> 01:00.294
so he gave me
this little fella.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.595
Wow, Burt, I think you got

01:01.629 --> 01:03.464
the better end
of that deal.
Yeah.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.433
We could never afford
lobsters at the store.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.435
I know! Tyler says
supermarkets have to overcharge

01:07.468 --> 01:09.770
because of all the middlemen
they have to pay.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.105
The delivery guy, the ice guy,

01:11.139 --> 01:13.407
those useless baggers
and checkers.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.309
Oh, I hate those guys.
Jimmy, we are those guys.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.744
VIRGINIA:
You should make this

01:16.777 --> 01:19.247
a regular thing
with Tyler.
I'm gonna.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.282
But I was thinking,
why stop with lobster?

01:21.315 --> 01:22.650
This could be huge.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.818
Think of the other things
I could trade for.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.288
Crabs, shrimp, mollusks.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.323
No. Think bigger.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.824
I don't know. Oysters.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.426
Um, uh... pelicans!

01:32.460 --> 01:34.228
Even bigger.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.764
We could both trade
services for stuff.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.433
We'd be doing
the same amount of work,

01:39.467 --> 01:41.502
but enjoying a much bigger
return on the cool stuff.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.137
That sounds great!

01:43.171 --> 01:45.239
You guys should find some
tradable skills and join us.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.007
Must be something
you're good at.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.642
I've gotten really good at
avoiding ridiculous ideas,

01:48.676 --> 01:50.844
which is why we're
gonna bow out.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.946
Plus, we have Barney's
first aid class tomorrow.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.483
First aid class?
What do you need that for?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.318
Yeah, first aid is just
a scam dreamed up

01:57.351 --> 02:00.020
by the gauze
and bandage people.
Or a proven life saver.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.190
Yeah, and since Hope spends
so much time here, we think

02:02.223 --> 02:04.658
you guys ought to check out
the class, too, for Hope's sake.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.127
Jimmy, kids get
hurt-- they scrape

02:07.161 --> 02:09.497
their elbows, they cut their
finger, they fall through

02:09.530 --> 02:10.998
a hole in the
bottom of your car.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.300
Nothing you can do
to avoid it.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.667
Besides, we got

02:13.701 --> 02:15.936
a perfectly good
first aid kit right here.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.773
See? La-la!

02:19.807 --> 02:23.611
"Shoot flare, eat sandwich,
wait for help."

02:23.644 --> 02:25.279
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.315
Maybe we should just
skip the class and...

02:27.348 --> 02:28.982
Jimmy.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.051
Oh, my.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.653
(pop)
(gasps)

02:32.686 --> 02:35.589
(flare squealing)

02:37.225 --> 02:39.026
(groaning)

02:39.059 --> 02:42.530
Oh, the years have not been kind
to this turkey salad sandwich.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.898
* Whoo

02:44.932 --> 02:50.137
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:50.170 --> 02:52.806
JIMMY: The next day, my parents
put their bartering plan

02:52.840 --> 02:54.675
into action,
and it actually worked.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.143
They got things
they needed.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.012
They got things
they didn't need.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.715
And they got things
that were long overdue.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.451
Rinse.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.389
JIMMY: Most importantly,
they got things

03:08.422 --> 03:10.958
they had always dreamt about.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.928
Oh, if we have maple syrup
this incredible here,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.231
why do we even
talk to Canada?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.533
Oh, man.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.602
Barb, what you're doing
right now is actually

03:21.635 --> 03:24.037
making me look forward
to cleaning your drain hair.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.506
Ah.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.777
Hey, Virginia,
check out my new lid.
Ooh.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.079
Old Lady Stevens made this for
me for cleaning out her pool.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.382
This bartering thing--
it's the greatest thing ever.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.850
I know. Massages, lobsters,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.085
crocheted hats.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.787
It's like we're barter-aires!

03:39.820 --> 03:41.255
I was thinking.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.890
What if the people

03:42.923 --> 03:44.725
who are trading with us
started trading with each other?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.461
Yeah. Natesville would become
a place where the good things

03:47.495 --> 03:49.630
in life actually trickle up to
the people who do all the work.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.098
A trickle-up economy.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.066
I think that's a thing.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.067
Mm.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.436
No.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.970
I'm thinking Tickle Me Elmo.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.977
You all may wonder why I'm
qualified to teach this class.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.447
Well, I learned a thing or two
from the trusty scouts.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.048
They would often administer
first aid

04:08.081 --> 04:10.751
after they beat
the tarnation out of me.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.953
I suppose I was
an easy target.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.488
Overweight,
asthmatic,

04:14.522 --> 04:16.657
anemic and wildly
color blind.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.426
You're late.
Is everything all right?

04:18.459 --> 04:21.762
I just got this
postcard from my mother.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.631
"Wish you were here."

04:23.664 --> 04:26.400
Oh, she's being nice
this time.
Yeah. Turn it over.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.936
"Because
forehead reduction surgery

04:28.969 --> 04:31.104
is super cheap in Ecuador.
Love, Tams."

04:31.138 --> 04:32.806
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.475
Yeah. Really, I
should be flattered.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.076
I mean, even in
tropical paradise,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.746
she's thinking
about my flaws.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.248
Unfortunately,
I took six brutal beatings

04:41.281 --> 04:43.984
before I learned there was
no merit badge for cruelty,

04:44.017 --> 04:47.455
and I'd been letting the scouts
pummel me for no real reason.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.256
Hey, everybody.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.292
Check out my big cans.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.695
(laughter)

04:54.728 --> 04:57.297
You all remember Josh. He's back
after a couple years away.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.099
(coughing):
SEAL Team Six.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.034
Josh is amazing
with grocery humor.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.438
He does a similar joke
with jugs.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.774
JIMMY:
Once my parents had gathered
all of Natesville's

05:06.807 --> 05:10.110
skilled workers, they attempted
to lay out the plan.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.380
It took a while for some
of them to understand.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.448
Hi. My name's Phil,
and I'm an alcoholic.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.049
ALL:
Hi, Phil.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.451
Phil, for the second time,

05:17.485 --> 05:18.986
that's not why we're here.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.488
Oh.
For the past
few days,

05:20.521 --> 05:23.657
Virginia and I have
enjoyed a lifestyle

05:23.691 --> 05:27.294
that previously
was beyond our reach.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.730
How d we do it, Burt?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.965
Through barter.
Oh.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.001
In fact, after only
a few hours of lawn work,

05:34.034 --> 05:37.671
I was able to trade for
something that was heretofore

05:37.705 --> 05:40.841
only available
to tycoons and walruses.

05:40.874 --> 05:41.909
ALL:
Oh.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.143
What is it?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.344
Well, look

05:44.378 --> 05:46.346
under your chairs
and find out!

05:46.380 --> 05:48.148
(all murmuring)

05:48.181 --> 05:50.150
Is that a lobster?
(all murmuring)

05:50.183 --> 05:51.385
That's right.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.086
You get a lobster!

05:53.120 --> 05:54.522
You get a lobster!

05:54.555 --> 05:56.189
You get a lobster!

05:56.223 --> 05:59.393
(screaming and crying)

05:59.427 --> 06:01.094
No!

06:01.128 --> 06:02.996
(crying)

06:03.030 --> 06:04.732
Make it stop!

06:04.765 --> 06:07.034
Sorry about the
paper towel.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.902
I don't believe in gauze.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.271
The thing
we're trying to say is,

06:11.304 --> 06:13.073
I was able to trade
for all these lobsters

06:13.106 --> 06:14.775
because we cut out
the middleman.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.076
I didn't have to pay

06:16.109 --> 06:17.445
the delivery guy,

06:17.478 --> 06:19.413
or the claw-rubberbanderer guy.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.914
Sorry again, Barb.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.282
And we're

06:22.315 --> 06:25.185
inviting you
to do the same thing,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.855
and not just with us,
but with each other.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.457
Because the more people
that are involved,

06:29.490 --> 06:30.858
the more people benefit.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.093
And again, this is not
a pyramid scheme.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.394
Although if you make pyramids,

06:34.428 --> 06:36.029
you're welcome
to join our scheme.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.297
Uh, I mean, system.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.699
So, are you saying

06:38.732 --> 06:40.768
I can trade
Old Lady Stevens lobsters

06:40.801 --> 06:43.971
for a crocheted suit
in a 42 slim?

06:44.004 --> 06:45.639
Oh, honey, that's
not gonna work.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.608
I'm allergic
to crustaceans.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.377
That's easy. (laughs)

06:50.410 --> 06:52.813
I mow your lawn,

06:52.846 --> 06:56.249
you give Tyler the suit,

06:56.283 --> 06:57.985
Tyler gives me the lobsters.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.590
Again,

07:02.623 --> 07:04.157
I can't stress enough,

07:04.191 --> 07:06.293
this is not a pyramid scheme.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.665
And Clara Barton said,
"You know what? I will."

07:11.699 --> 07:13.233
(yawning)

07:13.266 --> 07:17.170
And that, I think,
covers the origins of first aid.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.973
Oh, I can't believe that took
an hour and 45 minutes.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.942
Oh, well, let's move
quickly to choking.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.812
Now, here are the most common
choking hazards.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.614
Finally, some food.

07:26.647 --> 07:30.117
I'm starving.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.253
(groans)
Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.588
I think James is
really choking!

07:34.622 --> 07:36.356
Okay, nobody panic.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.292
(indistinct chatter
and gasping)

07:39.326 --> 07:41.194
Has anyone here ever
actually done the Heimlich?

07:41.228 --> 07:44.097
Yes.
I've only ever done it
with my special body pillow.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.799
(other murmuring)

07:45.833 --> 07:47.635
Oh, it's no use.
My hands are slipping!

07:47.668 --> 07:49.336
Damn my vain compulsion
to moisturize!

07:49.369 --> 07:51.138
My hands are beautiful,
but useless!

07:51.171 --> 07:54.474
(Sabrina grunts)

07:55.976 --> 07:57.044
Oh.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.478
JOSH:
Oh,

07:58.512 --> 08:00.714
my God. Jimmy's wife

08:00.748 --> 08:02.783
just saved his life.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.351
What a wuss!

08:04.384 --> 08:05.853
Hey, Jimmy, what's next?

08:05.886 --> 08:08.355
Are you gonna start
peeing sitting down?

08:08.388 --> 08:09.957
(laughter)

08:09.990 --> 08:12.225
Okay, you know what?
Can you just cut it out, Josh?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.628
Okay, okay, calm down.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.229
They're not gonna kill him.
They're jokes,

08:16.263 --> 08:17.698
not grapes.

08:17.731 --> 08:21.334
(laughter)

08:21.368 --> 08:23.704
(laughing loudly)

08:23.737 --> 08:27.708
I apologize, Jimmy.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.409
If I don't laugh
along with his jokes,

08:29.442 --> 08:31.679
he'll start making
fun of me again.

08:31.712 --> 08:35.415
As you know, I'm a veritable
minefield of mockable traits.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.917
It's all right, Frank.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.986
Yo, Frank, you coming?

08:39.019 --> 08:43.523
Yeah. I was just pointing Jimmy
towards the sanitary napkins.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.158
(laughter)

08:45.192 --> 08:47.628
(whispering):
I'm so sorry.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.333
Hey, are you okay?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.535
Hey, you know, I'm not a baby,
Sabrina, all right?

08:55.569 --> 08:58.105
I-I can take care of myself.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.243
What was that all about?

09:03.276 --> 09:04.745
I'm afraid you saved his life,

09:04.778 --> 09:06.413
but in the process,
you may have killed his manhood.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.948
Well, he was choking.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.717
What was I supposed to do?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.518
Well, you could have waited for
the professionals to show up.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.953
It's not like
a few less brain cells

09:12.986 --> 09:14.287
is gonna cost him a Pulitzer.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.724
Oh, okay, so,
I should just wait for him

09:16.757 --> 09:18.892
to choke in public again,
and then not save him?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.393
Oh, that could take days,

09:20.427 --> 09:21.895
and I don't think
he's got that kind of time.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.530
You've got to help him get
his masculinity back.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.898
How am I supposed to do that?

09:24.932 --> 09:26.366
Why are you asking me?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.101
I have two mothers, no wife,

09:28.135 --> 09:31.739
and those scouts who used
to beat me up... were girls.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.406
(knocking)

09:36.176 --> 09:38.111
We've got
a problem, Burt.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.047
I gave Barb a lobster,
but she only massaged

09:40.080 --> 09:41.815
the left side
of my body.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.917
It only took me one to realize
I don't really like lobster.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.819
Turns out, I just really like
melted butter.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.254
But now my left side

09:47.287 --> 09:49.589
is relaxed, and my right side
is tense as hell.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.491
Okay, we can figure this out.

09:51.524 --> 09:56.063
Burt, look at this.
I totally get it.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.098
You're a mechanic
with a spare tire.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.733
Apparently,
an oil change

09:59.767 --> 10:01.735
is only worth
half a sweater now.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.271
Knitting a sweater
takes a long time.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.940
Just be happy
it covers your man boobs.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.308
At least
they're not bouncing

10:08.341 --> 10:10.277
off my knees, you
useless bag of wrinkles.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:11.945 --> 10:13.313
We can work
this out.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.483
First, Phil,
apologize to your mother.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.986
JIMMY:
Unfortunately, there were more
than a few people

10:19.019 --> 10:20.821
that had a problem
with Mom and Dad's plan.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.355
So they brought everyone
together

10:22.389 --> 10:23.791
and tried to figure things out.

10:23.824 --> 10:28.128
Okay, so if Tyler gives
two lobsters to Barb,

10:28.161 --> 10:33.000
and Barb gives a third
of a massage to Dr. Conway,

10:33.033 --> 10:35.435
and Dr. Conway cleans four

10:35.468 --> 10:37.437
of Pam, the fortune teller's
teeth...

10:37.470 --> 10:39.639
Right, and she
gives half

10:39.673 --> 10:41.141
of next week's lottery
numbers to Phil,

10:41.174 --> 10:43.977
Phil fixes Syrup
Sam's truck

10:44.011 --> 10:45.478
in exchange for six pancakes

10:45.512 --> 10:47.214
worth of syrup to
Old Lady Stevens.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.549
Who makes a crocheted
hat for...

10:49.582 --> 10:53.653
Wait. Who needs
a crocheted hat?

10:56.589 --> 11:00.627
Our micro economic group may be
experiencing a Hat Bubble.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.995
Maybe we don't have to trade

11:02.029 --> 11:04.564
one particular service
for another?

11:04.597 --> 11:06.633
Maybe there's something
we can create

11:06.666 --> 11:09.036
that represents
the value of services rendered.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.238
Like colored beads
or a piece of paper.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.305
Paper's a good idea.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.573
That's pretty cool.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.843
But to make it
even more official...

11:15.876 --> 11:17.911
we should put
someone's face on it!

11:17.945 --> 11:19.980
(quiet ooh-ing and ah-ing)

11:20.013 --> 11:23.350
Now, who could that be?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.919
*

11:31.091 --> 11:33.226
JIMMY:
To bring their barter system
to the next level,

11:33.260 --> 11:34.928
my parents went down
to Lee's Copy Shop

11:34.962 --> 11:37.497
and had him print up
hundreds of Burt Bucks.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.933
*

11:43.403 --> 11:44.905
There's plenty
to go around.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.007
Trust me, this'll make
everything easier.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.942
They come in threes,
sevens and 11's.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.911
Those are Burt's
lucky numbers.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.448
No...

11:55.482 --> 11:57.350
you are.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.119
Oh, that's good.

11:59.152 --> 12:02.722
(clattering)
SABRINA (calls):
Jimmy! Jimmy, help!

12:05.425 --> 12:08.228
(gasps):
Oh! I'll catch you!

12:08.261 --> 12:09.863
(grunts)

12:09.897 --> 12:11.731
Oh, my God!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.801
(muffled rock music
through headphones)

12:13.834 --> 12:15.769
Hey, Frank! Stop!

12:16.569 --> 12:18.305
Frank! Stop!

12:19.006 --> 12:20.607
(groans)

12:26.613 --> 12:27.881
(Sabrina grunts)

12:27.915 --> 12:29.249
Oh!

12:29.282 --> 12:31.018
Oh, my God.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.921
Ha! Classic!

12:33.954 --> 12:35.388
Congratulations, Jimmy.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.656
You're about
to go from being

12:36.689 --> 12:38.725
the biggest idiot
in the store

12:38.758 --> 12:40.828
to the biggest
on the Internet.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.930
No, you are!

12:43.997 --> 12:45.833
Well done, James.
You're a hero.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.400
If you hadn't caught
the dangling Sabrina,

12:47.434 --> 12:50.503
she may have... broken a log.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.571
Wait, that doesn't

12:51.604 --> 12:52.739
make any sense.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.274
Oh. A leg.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.275
Or...

12:55.308 --> 12:57.410
cut off her head?

12:57.444 --> 12:58.678
Wait a minute.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.413
You guys faked this?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.316
Bet that's not the only thing
she has to fake.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.618
(Frank chuckles)

13:05.652 --> 13:08.822
Sorry, I thought Josh
was still here.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.025
Well, I'm off to my mani-pedi.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.427
Can you spot me
a few Burt bucks?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.429
No. I spent my last ones
on a crochet lesson

13:16.463 --> 13:18.665
from Old Lady Stevens,
so I can make this

13:18.698 --> 13:22.202
toilet seat cozy.
Ooh, that's gonna be great
in winter, but if you're out

13:22.235 --> 13:23.503
of Burt Bucks and I'm out

13:23.536 --> 13:25.138
of Burt Bucks,
then we got a problem.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.840
I guess you're just gonna have
to mow more lawns

13:26.874 --> 13:28.341
and I'm gonna have
to clean more houses.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.610
But my mani-pedi's today.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.680
I've got so many paper cuts from
handling all those Burt Bucks,

13:33.713 --> 13:35.548
I'm getting a hot
paraffin wax dip.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.684
I can't miss that,
Virginia, I just can't.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.619
Doesn't seem fair.
If there's anyone

13:39.652 --> 13:42.622
who should never run out
of Burt Bucks, it's Burt.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.291
There's got
to be a way

13:44.324 --> 13:46.293
we can bail ourselves
out of this.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.129
What if we just print ourselves
some extra Burt Bucks?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.298
I mean, that's good
for everyone,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.866
because the more we spend,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.068
the more everyone else
will have to spend.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.137
I'm no Warren "Buffet,"

13:57.170 --> 14:00.640
but I bet that's just
the thing to stimulate
our bartering economy.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.575
Reading those money magazines
while you're on the can

14:02.609 --> 14:05.245
in the fancy houses you clean
is really paying off.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.350
*

14:10.383 --> 14:12.185
* I've got the brains

14:12.219 --> 14:14.754
* And you've got the looks

14:14.787 --> 14:18.425
* Let's make lots of money

14:18.458 --> 14:20.327
* You've got the brawn

14:20.360 --> 14:22.829
* I've got the brains

14:22.862 --> 14:25.032
* Let's make lots of

14:26.433 --> 14:28.268
* I've had enough of scheming

14:28.301 --> 14:30.403
* And messing around
with jerks *

14:30.437 --> 14:32.372
* My car is parked outside

14:32.405 --> 14:34.441
* I'm afraid it doesn't work

14:34.474 --> 14:36.509
* I'm looking for a partner

14:36.543 --> 14:38.845
* Someone who
gets things fixed *

14:38.878 --> 14:40.613
* Ask yourself this question

14:40.647 --> 14:42.815
* Do you want to be rich?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.853
* Let's *
* I've got the brains

14:46.886 --> 14:48.922
* Make *
* You've got the looks

14:48.956 --> 14:50.857
* Let's make lots of money

14:50.890 --> 14:52.625
* Money *

14:52.659 --> 14:54.894
* Let's *
* You've got the brawn

14:54.928 --> 14:57.130
* Make *
* I've got the brains

14:57.164 --> 15:01.268
* Let's make lots of money...

15:02.102 --> 15:05.105
Oil change is done.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.074
Change it again!

15:07.107 --> 15:09.076
(whooping)

15:09.109 --> 15:10.410
(both panting)

15:10.443 --> 15:12.045
That was amazing.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.115
Yeah. Now that we've made
sweet love on paper money,

15:15.148 --> 15:18.585
it's gonna be really hard
to go back to coins.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.053
(gasps)

15:20.087 --> 15:21.554
(gasps)

15:21.588 --> 15:23.123
I can't believe this.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.458
I'm all over the Internet.
I've got 58 views,

15:25.492 --> 15:27.894
and every time I check it,
it gets higher.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.329
Look at this! 59!

15:29.362 --> 15:31.098
How many times have
you checked it?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.766
I don't know, 50, 55.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.770
I don't want to be dramatic,
about this, but...

15:37.804 --> 15:41.241
sometimes I wish you
had just let me die
in that first aid class.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.742
(sighs)

15:42.775 --> 15:44.244
(clattering)
Jimmy, look...

15:44.277 --> 15:45.645
What was that?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.580
I think there's
somebody in the garage.

15:47.614 --> 15:52.219
Really? Your little stunt in
the grocery store wasn't enough?

15:54.354 --> 15:55.855
(gasps)

15:56.723 --> 15:58.691
Oh, come on.
No.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.860
A masked burglar?
I mean, what...
what is this,

16:00.893 --> 16:02.529
Scooby-Doo?
Jimmy, I...

16:03.830 --> 16:04.797
Josh?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.199
How could you hire the guy

16:06.233 --> 16:07.834
who makes
the most fun of me

16:07.867 --> 16:10.303
to make me feel even worse
about myself?

16:10.337 --> 16:13.506
I did not hire him.
I think he's actually
trying to rob us.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.208
Oh, yeah, like
I'm supposed to believe

16:15.242 --> 16:17.677
that this
is real.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.978
(gasps)
Jimmy!

16:23.316 --> 16:24.784
(grunts)

16:24.817 --> 16:26.086
(gasps)

16:31.891 --> 16:34.327
Why does this
keep happening?

16:34.361 --> 16:36.096
Um...

16:42.735 --> 16:45.205
You... should
be ashamed.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.506
What would
your brothers

16:46.539 --> 16:47.574
at SEAL Team Six

16:47.607 --> 16:48.908
have to say about this?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.677
Probably, "Who's Josh?"

16:50.710 --> 16:51.878
Because I was

16:51.911 --> 16:53.880
obviously lying about that.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.915
I was in prison, you idiots.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.684
So you just got out of prison

16:57.717 --> 16:59.552
and you're already
trying to rob us?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.888
Big house, tiny wife,
wimpy husband--

17:01.921 --> 17:03.690
it's what every
home invader dreams of.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.359
Oh, great. Now the police
and everyone in town

17:06.393 --> 17:09.396
are gonna know that
you saved me one more time.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.098
I'm never gonna be able
to live this down.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.599
Jimmy, we could
just tell everybody

17:12.632 --> 17:14.767
that you saved me, okay?
Who's gonna know?

17:14.801 --> 17:16.603
I'll know.
I'll know, too.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.272
You know what?
Maybe a little duct tape

17:19.306 --> 17:21.074
is gonna shut you up...

17:21.108 --> 17:23.110
in about...

17:23.143 --> 17:24.777
Eh...

17:24.811 --> 17:26.479
Yah!

17:36.156 --> 17:39.025
Jimmy, wha...
what is this?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060
Oh, those?
Uh... that's...

17:41.094 --> 17:43.196
that's nothing.
I'll-I'll get those.
Wait,

17:43.230 --> 17:45.465
but these are all addressed
to me-- why haven't I seen them?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.867
Maybe Hope put them in here--
you know that she likes

17:47.900 --> 17:49.636
to play mailman and hoarder.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.139
It's more of those postcards
from my mom.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.940
What are they doing out here?

17:53.973 --> 17:57.377
I always, um, hide them in here
before you see them,

17:57.410 --> 18:00.079
because I know
how much they upset you.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.682
I'm sorry.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.156
What was that for?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.457
Because you committed

18:10.490 --> 18:13.126
a federal crime
to protect my feelings.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.896
Oh, Jimmy, don't you see?

18:16.929 --> 18:20.167
I may have saved you
a couple times, but...

18:20.200 --> 18:23.035
you save me every day.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.176
I miss my prison husband.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.478
What?
Nothin'.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.180
Mmm!

18:33.213 --> 18:35.615
Burt, we've done it!

18:35.648 --> 18:37.917
We are livin' the good life.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.952
And even though I haven't eaten
anything but lobster, butter

18:39.986 --> 18:42.755
and maple syrup for
the last three days, I
have never felt better.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.791
You know, I was thinking,

18:44.824 --> 18:47.093
while lobster
is pretty damn good,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.329
what does Tracetown have
that Natesville doesn't?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.664
Reading level
of a third grade country.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.934
No, something we don't have:
delicious ribs.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.169
Mmm.
It's time to expand

18:56.203 --> 18:57.937
our system,
bring other towns in.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.340
Which would mean more
goods and services.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.608
And not just ribs.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.075
We could get pies.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.513
Or a dermatologist.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.915
(gasps)
A guy who makes keys.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.117
Hey, Chances.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.820
Hey, Tyler.
Lookin' sharp!

19:13.853 --> 19:15.488
Pour yourself a glass
of maple syrup.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.457
Oh, I'm good.
Uh, let me ask you,

19:17.490 --> 19:20.193
you didn't print up
any extra Burt Bucks, did you?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.396
We're not saying we did,

19:23.430 --> 19:26.966
butwe did...
why would that be a problem?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.201
I had a feeling.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.702
You flooded the market.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.970
You're welcome.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.872
It's not good.
I sold my last lobster

19:32.905 --> 19:35.675
for 4,000 Burt Bucks.
Didn't you learn anything

19:35.708 --> 19:38.044
from the hyper-inflation fiasco
in Zimbabwe?

19:38.077 --> 19:40.980
We didn't do it the Zim-bob-way,
we did it our way.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.216
(chuckles)
TYLER:
I'm sorry, guys,

19:43.250 --> 19:46.085
Burt Bucks are worthless;
I can't accept them anymore.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.522
See you around.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.991
Well, that's
just one guy.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.760
It shouldn't matter.
System's too big--

19:53.793 --> 19:55.728
it can't fail.
(chuckles)

19:55.762 --> 19:57.830
JIMMY:
But it wasn't just one guy,

19:57.864 --> 20:01.401
and it only took a couple hours
for the entire system to fail.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.503
Once lobster was out,
big syrup fell,

20:03.536 --> 20:06.205
and then the entire
crochet industry unraveled.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.576
Pretty soon, my parents
were left holding the bag...

20:09.609 --> 20:11.778
or, in this case,
several wheelbarrows

20:11.811 --> 20:14.146
filled with worthless paper.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.555
I guess if you think
about this purely in
terms of wheelbarrows,

20:22.589 --> 20:24.857
we came out
way ahead.
And...

20:24.891 --> 20:26.125
nobody really got hurt.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.294
True.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.528
LEE (calls):
Hello?

20:28.561 --> 20:29.929
Oh, hello!

20:29.962 --> 20:31.931
Mr. Lee? What are
you doing here?

20:31.964 --> 20:33.733
Well, I need to get paid
for the printing.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.802
No problem.
Can I pay you in Burt Bucks?

20:35.835 --> 20:38.438
(laughs)
That's very funny!

20:38.471 --> 20:40.640
What can I do
with all the play money?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.409
I can't pay rent,
I can't buy ink,

20:42.442 --> 20:44.277
and it's far too rough
for toilet paper.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.946
You need to take
care of this.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.449
(clears throat)
Okay.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.151
Uh-huh.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.755
Interesting. Mm-hmm.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.792
Let me ask you this.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.061
Do you take wheelbarrows?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.897
Mom and Dad's bartering system
finally worked...

21:04.931 --> 21:06.833
just not how they planned.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.101
They lived the high life
for one week,

21:09.135 --> 21:12.004
but it cost them 50,000 hours
of landscaping and cleaning.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.474
Burt, when you're done,
there are more hedges
behind the building.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.275
Nice!

21:18.110 --> 21:21.981
Well, on the bright side, this
won't be our problem forever.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.984
After we're gone, our children
and our children's children

21:25.017 --> 21:27.320
will be paying off our debts
to the Chinese printer.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.422
Well, it's a good thing
people smarter than us

21:29.456 --> 21:31.424
are running the
real government.
