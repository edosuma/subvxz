02:40.294 --> 02:42.863
- It was the night
that everything had changed.

02:43.098 --> 02:47.568
No one could predict,
but some saw it coming.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.907
Fernando was my best friend.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.544
- Last night, my brother.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.578
- Yeah, man.

02:58.979 --> 02:59.979
Boom.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.315
Bills.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.590
- I didn't think
I could keep my secret,

03:09.623 --> 03:11.292
but Fernando kept his.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.828
You're a spy.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.499
I'm drunk though, I am.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.471
Shawn, my man.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.373
- Come on.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.776
- Oh come on man, you've
been working for three weeks,

03:28.809 --> 03:30.009
you're still looking for ID's?

03:33.514 --> 03:35.549
- Suzanne, you're
looking lovely as ever.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.651
- Thank you, $5 handsome.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.753
- Oh come on, it's
the last night,

03:39.787 --> 03:40.921
shouldn't we all
get in for free.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.223
- Every week, every week.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.931
- Pretty sure I'm 21.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.367
- Bill, gotta
keep the books clean

03:53.401 --> 03:55.636
even though the place
has gone to shit.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.906
Even Shiam Simya doesn't
condone underage drinking.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.743
- You're weird
dude, but I love it.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.012
Come on in, let me
buy you a drink.

04:05.045 --> 04:09.383
- I'm on the clock, Bill,
but you go in and have fun.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.521
- Really?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.789
- Jacob was not that good.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.690
- I disagree.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.692
- I worked with the
man for six years,

04:19.726 --> 04:22.596
we were like brothers,
there's no way that he could

04:22.630 --> 04:25.065
have faked that he knew me.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.569
- Don't ever count anybody out.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.339
- I just totally don't agree.

04:31.372 --> 04:35.409
- Wouldn't be the first
time you were wrong.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.378
How much money do we got?

04:37.411 --> 04:39.580
- Well Shiam Simya took it all.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.350
- You're obsessed.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.919
- They were all
there, my wife Tammy,

04:45.953 --> 04:48.889
my girl Sandra, my
work buddy Tyler.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.025
And Sandra's BFF Karen,
and of course, Craig.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.563
All had their own secrets,
well except Craig.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.904
- Making a deposit, Tyler boy?

05:03.937 --> 05:05.706
- Huh?

05:05.739 --> 05:08.409
- There's a free urinal in
here if you piss standing up.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.777
- I find it weird
that you're concerned

05:09.810 --> 05:11.445
at all where I pee.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.949
- Last night at the old
watering hole, huh, T money?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.619
Let's go out with a bang, right?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.652
- Bang.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.657
- Well far be it
for me to tell a man

05:23.691 --> 05:26.394
how to conduct his business.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.427
- Exactly.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.836
- For you, and one for you.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.780
- I got this.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.702
- What's up my man?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.003
- What up, brother, how are you?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
Hey, how you doin'?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.207
Oh, nope.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.156
- Why don't you look
at a menu instead?

06:29.189 --> 06:32.593
- Don't worry, he's
not looking at you.

06:35.929 --> 06:36.997
- Is that on the
happy hour menu?

06:37.030 --> 06:38.030
- Gross.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.871
- Even with a discount, it will
be more than you can afford.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.640
- Ah, you'd be surprised
how big my wallet is, baby.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.176
- All the size in the
world can't make up

06:49.209 --> 06:52.079
for having a credit
score of asshole pervert.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.048
- Well what do you expect
wearing a skirt like that, huh?

06:55.082 --> 06:58.051
- I expect you to first,
not smoke in my bar,

06:58.085 --> 06:59.853
and second to order
for the last time

06:59.887 --> 07:01.455
so I don't have to
see you anymore.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.492
- Wow, way to kill the
mood, sweetheart, geez.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.126
Come on, you know what I want.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.194
It's gonna be hard
for me to find another

07:07.227 --> 07:09.129
good bar in this neighborhood.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.465
- Well you could,
you know, branch out,

07:11.499 --> 07:14.835
try new experiences, and
don't call me, sweetheart.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.203
I'm not your wife.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.006
- Oh, my wife is not sweet,
she gives me cavities.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.810
But you, if she was
half as good as you,

07:22.843 --> 07:25.112
I'd call her sweetheart too.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.015
What is this?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.851
What is this, you know
what I like, light beer.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.019
Come on.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.755
- Well shit Bill, I guess I'm
distracted by your charms.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.857
- When are you gonna
finally stop pretending

07:36.890 --> 07:38.258
that you're attracted to me,

07:38.291 --> 07:40.594
give me some of that sweet.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.063
- First of all, who
talks like that?

07:43.096 --> 07:45.599
Why do you try so hard?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.701
You got your light beer
right in front of you.

07:47.735 --> 07:52.005
- Well this beer only
quenches one kind of thirst.

07:52.039 --> 07:55.876
- You know how everybody
thinks girls dig assholes?

07:55.909 --> 07:59.980
Well they're wrong, they
like guys with class.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.181
Like your friend Tyler.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.816
- Oh, yeah I'm sure
the chiseled body and

08:02.850 --> 08:04.718
the washboard abs
don't hurt, huh?

08:04.752 --> 08:06.486
- You're an asshole.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.222
You might have your
wife at home fooled,

08:09.256 --> 08:10.924
and your sweet little
girlfriend in the corner

08:10.958 --> 08:14.728
obviously wants you more
than anyone ever would.

08:14.762 --> 08:18.599
So leave me the hell alone
and finish your drink.

08:18.632 --> 08:22.670
Maybe I won't tell either of
them how friendly you are.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.239
Oh, and I expect a good
tip for that wisdom.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.107
Good boy.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.081
- Oh, speak of the devil, damn.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.048
- Hi, honey.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.149
- Hey, sweetheart, how are you?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.183
- Oh.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.620
- What are you doing here?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.253
I thought you were
going to a new club

08:40.287 --> 08:41.655
with Jessica and Lizzie.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.823
- Oh, I'm not here
to spoil your fun,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.024
I'm gonna meet up
with them in a minute.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.292
- Come on, you're not
gonna spoil all the fun.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.259
But what's up?

08:46.293 --> 08:49.162
- I was just wondering
what time you'd be home?

08:49.196 --> 08:52.165
- Why didn't you just text me?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.736
- It was on my way.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.071
- I don't know, I mean,
it's the last night

08:58.105 --> 09:00.173
so I figured I'd
go the distance.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.109
- You're not in
college anymore, Bill.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.078
- Well, one could argue that
this is like grad school.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.279
- What time?

09:06.313 --> 09:09.583
- I don't know, 2:00 AM,
5:00 AM, I don't know.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.684
2:00 is fine.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.319
No, I said 5:00.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.854
- What will it be, Tammy?

09:13.887 --> 09:14.788
- Oh, the usual.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.057
- Coming right up.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.291
- Hey, guys.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.628
- Hey, Tyler, what's
up, look who it is.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.195
Playgirl centerfold.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.299
- What can I get
for you, sweetheart.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.669
- Hey, Jackie, just the usual.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.103
- Coming right up.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.276
- I don't believe
this, what is this?

09:36.309 --> 09:37.510
- Believe what?

09:37.544 --> 09:41.148
- What, my wife, mentally
addressing one of my best friends.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.349
Come on.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.152
- I can look, I
just can't touch.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.220
Right Bill, I mean that's
how you always do it.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.257
- Well, that only applies to me.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.094
- I will touch Tyler anytime
or place he wants me to.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.696
- Okay, all right, what is that?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.130
What is that, huh?

09:58.231 --> 09:59.933
- It's sovereign blanc,
it's a white wine.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.201
- Sovereign what?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.970
White wine, what are
you on your way to

10:03.003 --> 10:04.171
a Liza Minnelli concert?

10:04.204 --> 10:05.372
Come on Jackie, get
this guy a real drink.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.007
Come on, it's the
last night, come on.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.009
- Hey, it's up to him.

10:09.042 --> 10:13.313
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take
something stronger.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.248
- Give him my usual, you
remember what that is.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.417
- Light beer, maybe?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.252
- That's a real
professional, right there.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.121
- Well technically though, Bill,

10:21.154 --> 10:23.290
that light beer is not
even a third as strong

10:23.323 --> 10:24.825
as his white wine.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.694
- Ooh, well aren't we smart.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.663
All right Tyler, tonight
we're gonna play darts,

10:29.697 --> 10:31.064
we're gonna drink beer like men.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.265
Come on, what do you say?

10:32.299 --> 10:35.402
One last Mr. Phil's dart
game, what do you say?

10:35.435 --> 10:39.239
- Last game, you never
even had a first game.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.444
- Well maybe I'm
trying to branch out.

10:51.218 --> 10:56.023
- God damn it, I wish he would
come play with.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.056
- Me too.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.160
- I would ride
him like a donkey.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.696
I bet he's hung like a horse.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.966
- Only one way to know.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.035
- You got that right.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.037
- I think I should go
be with my husband.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.304
- Yeah, see ya.

11:17.845 --> 11:18.845
Hey, girls.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.153
- Can I have a ginger
ale please, Jackie?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.316
- Sure, coming right up.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.819
- Ooh, that sounds good,
can I have one too?

11:25.853 --> 11:27.454
- You got it.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.489
- Can you put some rum in mine?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.893
Well actually, can you
put a lot of rum in mine?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.928
Maybe some Jim, some whiskey.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.329
- Hey, it's your funeral Karen.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.299
Anything extra for you, Sandra?

11:39.332 --> 11:43.070
- Not quite yet, we'll wait a
little while before we start.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.504
- You guys wanna open a tab?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.940
Happy hour for
another 15 minutes.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.976
- Yeah, why do they
call it happy hour?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.377
I mean, that doesn't
make any sense.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.080
Shouldn't like every
hour be happy hour?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.281
- Well you both
look hot tonight,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.884
let's just say you
should be happy.

11:58.185 --> 12:02.222
- Ugh God, look Sandra,
Tammy's gonna leave any second.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.958
- I hope so, I need
to talk to him.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.294
- You know who you
should wanna talk to?

12:07.327 --> 12:10.130
Tyler, god he is
just perfection.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.867
Look at him, he's so big.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.037
Oh yeah, then there's
Bill who's Bill.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.374
- Well Bill has his charms,
besides Jackie's in love

12:21.408 --> 12:22.976
with Tyler, so.

12:23.010 --> 12:26.513
- Oh, love is definitely not
the word I would have used.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.547
- Well you better
get up on that,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.950
because that dick is mine.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.988
- You better turn your
attention elsewhere.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.790
Who's your runner up?

12:38.225 --> 12:42.362
Aw, Craig, you could be his one
and only doll for the night.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.800
- Hey, I don't
know, where is he?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.468
- You may wanna find
the nearest mirror.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.537
- Oh my God, wow, such a bitch.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.372
- I'm just kidding, he
usually goes to the gym

12:52.405 --> 12:55.475
before he gets here, so he
should be walking in any minute.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.545
- See, consistency, that's
a good trait for a man.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.048
- No, predictability, no way.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.783
What?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.820
- Oh nothing, I just didn't
know you knew a word that big.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.160
- That's good.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.863
- It's all about concentration.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.564
- Is that all you got?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.904
- Okay, I'll eat my
words, but watch this.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.339
♪ Too many people
living in this world

13:26.373 --> 13:30.510
♪ Wonder what's
gonna kill them all

13:31.544 --> 13:32.980
I made it on the board.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.018
I don't think that counts.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.989
Ooh.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.923
- Not bad at all.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.925
- That was pretty good.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.067
- So, what the doctor say?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.936
- If you came with
me you would know.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.605
- Come on, don't
start this again.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.340
- I know, I'm sorry.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.612
The doctor said that there's
no problem with your parts.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.415
Some couples just
can't conceive.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.420
- Okay, so what do we do now?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.322
- Well we're not
entirely out of options,

14:15.355 --> 14:19.492
we can keep trying, we can
adopt, we can get a surrogate.

14:21.494 --> 14:25.098
- Surrogacy, I get to
have sex with her, right?

14:25.132 --> 14:26.132
- Yeah.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.135
And medically she's
required to be

14:28.168 --> 14:30.037
a 19 year old cheerleader.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.639
- Yeah, you know,
doctors are so smart.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.275
Come here, hey, hey.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.412
Look, I know I talk
a lot, okay, but...

14:39.446 --> 14:41.982
- Look, there are worse things
in life than ejaculating

14:42.015 --> 14:44.217
into a cup while watching porn.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.487
- Well I do that now,
just not into a cup.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.191
- Well, we can make a
sex tape if you want.

14:53.293 --> 14:58.231
- Or we could find a
girlfriend and have a threesome

14:58.265 --> 15:01.268
for a while, until
she gets pregnant.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.203
- Very funny.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.405
- No, you can pick the girl.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.108
- Oh, you're so considerate.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.444
Okay, how about that one.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.393
- I'll see if she's interested.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.995
- Keep dreaming, tutz.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.965
If you touch any of these
girls, I'll kill you.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.435
- Okay, sounds good.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.170
Have a good time tonight.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.071
See you at 2:00.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.105
5:00.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.182
- What was that about?

15:49.216 --> 15:50.250
- Oh my god, do you
think Bill told her?

15:50.283 --> 15:54.521
- Not a chance, Bill
practically lives in secrecy.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.724
Lucky bitch.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.260
- Lucky?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.063
Okay look, her husband
is cheating on her.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.232
He spends every possible
moment in this shitty bar.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.466
- Hey!

16:06.499 --> 16:11.138
- I'm sorry, I love you very
much but this is a shitty bar.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.406
What the hell do you see in him?

16:13.440 --> 16:17.344
- Hello, he's got looks,
and charm, and brains,

16:17.377 --> 16:20.313
and yeah, he's
really, really cute.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.219
- And I thought I
had low standards.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.654
- He's got a wife.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.360
And she's gone so
go talk to him.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.261
- I will.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.232
I will, geez, just give me a...

16:39.266 --> 16:41.134
Just give me a minute.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.447
- Hey, you think Sandra's hot?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.116
- Yeah, she's all right.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.750
- Would you bang her?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.252
- Are you serious?

16:59.286 --> 17:01.821
- Oh come on, it's a
simple man to man question.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.456
- Dude, you're a sex addict.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.258
- Yeah, maybe.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.358
No come on, seriously,
there's gotta be somebody

17:06.393 --> 17:08.261
that you're interested in.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.429
Oh, Karen?

17:09.462 --> 17:10.597
- Mmm hmm.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.531
- Jackie, Jackie,
Jackie wants your ass.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.499
I'm hooking you up with Jackie,

17:12.531 --> 17:14.666
I'm gonna give her your number.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.539
- You a lefty?

17:19.571 --> 17:20.573
- Look, don't change
the subject, okay?

17:20.607 --> 17:21.674
I'm hooking you up with Jackie.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.642
- No.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.510
- Yes.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.542
- No.

17:27.847 --> 17:28.847
- Assholes.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.519
- Oh, and there's Fernando.

17:32.552 --> 17:36.156
- Dude, calm down, it's
not even a big deal.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.559
- He fired me, I've never
been fired from a job before.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.728
- You'll find another job.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.303
- A government job's
supposed to be secure.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.574
- Look, just don't do
anything stupid, all right?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.575
It's only a job.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.310
- Just a job?

17:57.344 --> 17:58.545
Let me tell you something,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.214
if I see my boss,
I will murder him.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.584
- Whatever you say, bro.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.617
Let's go.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.588
- His hair never moves.

18:08.621 --> 18:09.689
- Did you say he looked nice?

18:09.722 --> 18:11.224
- No, I said he...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.293
- What was that, what was that?

18:13.326 --> 18:14.761
- He made me look twice
to see if it was him.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.862
- Oh, right, right,
made me look twice,

18:15.895 --> 18:18.298
his hair looks nice, right?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.267
- What's up, dude?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.368
- Hey, what's up man?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.235
- I'm Craig.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.269
- Bill.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.138
- Hey, Tyler.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.740
- What's that?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.909
You shake like my grandma, dude.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.877
- Fernie!

18:30.910 --> 18:32.212
- Don't call me that, man.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.246
- Oh come on, lighten up, geez.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.814
- Not today man.

18:34.847 --> 18:39.186
- All right, let's just
throw some darts, all right?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.322
- Well I saw Tammy
pulling out of here.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.491
- Yeah, she was here
a little bit ago.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.193
- What, she's not gonna stay?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.561
- No, she went to checkout
some new cocktail bar

18:48.595 --> 18:49.796
with her friends.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.632
- What, aren't we her friends?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.634
- So anyway, listen
up, check this out.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.238
Okay, so this guy who's
engaged to be married,

18:58.271 --> 19:02.242
and he's always had the hots
for his fiance's sister.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.243
Look at this guy?

19:03.276 --> 19:07.414
So one day, they're home
alone and as the sister

19:08.548 --> 19:10.517
keeps, you know, kind
of flirting with him

19:10.550 --> 19:11.651
because she knows that he's
got the hots for her, right?

19:11.684 --> 19:13.420
It's written all over his face.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.224
So she says to him, "I know
that you have the hots for me,

19:17.257 --> 19:20.927
"and I know that you're not
married yet to my sister,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.330
"I'll have sex
with you one time,

19:23.363 --> 19:25.565
"and I promise that
nobody else will find out.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.935
"We'll go upstairs right
now and we'll do this."

19:28.968 --> 19:30.036
And so he hears this
and he's tripping out,

19:30.069 --> 19:32.639
he's like, you know,
sweating, his heart's beating.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.809
So he follows her
upstairs, gets to the top,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.579
all of a sudden spins around,
shoots down the steps,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.348
busts out the front door.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.316
When he gets out there, the
whole families out there,

19:43.350 --> 19:46.719
soon to be wife, mom, dad,
cousins, aunts, and uncles,

19:46.753 --> 19:48.321
everybody.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.758
Future father in law comes
up to him, embraces him,

19:51.791 --> 19:56.296
he says son, congratulations,
you passed the test.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.466
Welcome to the family,
you're the one.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.570
What's the moral
to the story, boys?

20:03.603 --> 20:04.737
- Don't cheat.

20:06.339 --> 20:09.309
- Always leave the
condoms in the car.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.246
Yeah?

20:13.280 --> 20:13.913
- Yes, dude?

20:13.946 --> 20:14.781
- Right, you with me?

20:14.814 --> 20:15.648
- I was with you, man.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.682
- Nothing?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.957
- You need a drink, let's go.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.969
- Tyler and I would
like the usual.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.339
- Piss beer, got it.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.275
- I make no apologies
for my taste.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.476
Fernie.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.977
- I told you to stop
calling me that.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.746
Yeah, I'll have another.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.980
- Craig?

20:48.014 --> 20:50.417
- Give me some Pink's
Jackpot Vodka shot.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.420
- Ooh, vodka and energy
drink, good man, good man.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.921
That's actually Sandra's
favorite drink too.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.423
You mind sending
one over to her?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.758
- Well Sandra just
had ginger ale before,

20:58.791 --> 21:01.628
and she's not
drinking, apparently.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.029
- Why not?

21:03.062 --> 21:06.633
- I don't know, why don't
you ask her yourself?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.000
- I will be back.

21:10.737 --> 21:11.671
- Last night.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.704
- Yeah, man.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.550
- Is Karen sitting here?

21:23.583 --> 21:24.517
- No, she's in the bathroom.

21:24.551 --> 21:25.852
She'll probably be a while.

21:25.885 --> 21:26.885
It's fine.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.561
- What, just ginger ale?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.896
- Bill, do you care about me?

21:36.929 --> 21:39.932
- Do fish fly, do
zebras have spots?

21:42.535 --> 21:45.004
- Why was Tammy pointing at me?

21:46.606 --> 21:49.876
- Oh yeah, I said that we
should have a threesome to

21:49.909 --> 21:51.744
get you pregnant, but I
think that twosome would

21:51.778 --> 21:52.612
probably work just...

21:52.645 --> 21:53.680
- I'm pregnant.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.456
- Oh my god, is it mine?

22:05.091 --> 22:08.060
- Yeah, it's yours,
and I'm keeping it.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.430
So you have to tell Tammy.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.100
- I will, I will.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.969
- Don't blow me off, okay.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.039
When are you gonna tell her?

22:20.072 --> 22:21.441
- Soon.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.743
- I want you to
tell her tonight.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.679
- Okay, I will, I will.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.115
- Okay, shake on it.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.386
- What are we
cowboys or something?

22:33.420 --> 22:35.021
I said I'd handle it.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.161
- Now you're committed.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.397
- What a wonderful word.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.569
Hey, hey!

22:49.602 --> 22:50.602
- Hey, that's not funny.

22:57.577 --> 22:58.778
You're freaking me out, man.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.112
- I'm in trouble, man.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.146
- What, how?

23:02.515 --> 23:04.451
- Can I tell you a secret?

23:04.484 --> 23:05.117
- Yeah.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.919
- This is big.

23:06.953 --> 23:07.954
- Mine is more important, man.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.056
- I'm losing my shit right now.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.192
I got Sandra pregnant.
- I got fired.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.694
- What happened?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.765
- You got her pregnant.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.467
- Don't tell Tammy.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.736
- Shit, man.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.038
- Yeah, she said she wants
to keep it, what do I do?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.173
- That means you gotta keep it.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.009
- Oh really, is that
what that means?

23:32.779 --> 23:35.515
- Well look, you're
gonna have to tell

23:35.548 --> 23:37.684
the wife eventually, right?

23:37.717 --> 23:38.885
Now you have a reason.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.053
- You know what, the
universe can suck it.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.890
The universe hates me, the
universe is ruining my life.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.157
- Come on, I wouldn't talk
that way about the universe

23:45.191 --> 23:46.759
right now, come on.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.194
- You know when Tammy finds
out, she's gonna kill me.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.328
She's gonna literally kill me.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.997
She's gonna find me at night,
she's gonna duct tape me

23:51.030 --> 23:52.632
and slit my throat.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.234
- She's a crazy bitch but
she's not gonna kill you.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.137
- No, you've really seen
the tip of the iceberg, man.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.539
Tammy is psycho.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.140
Okay, why do you think
I'm still with her?

24:01.173 --> 24:05.512
Shit, I wanted to leave her
after six weeks of marriage.

24:06.846 --> 24:10.617
Besides, I told Sandy that
I'd tell Tammy tonight.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.885
- Well look, um,

24:18.625 --> 24:20.960
do you want me to tell her?

24:20.993 --> 24:21.894
- What...

24:21.928 --> 24:23.563
- No, no, think about it.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.265
If you tell her, she'll
probably kill you.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.235
But if I tell her, she'll
get mad I kept a secret

24:29.268 --> 24:32.972
for a week, or maybe she'll be
calmer next time you see her.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.206
- Is that right?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.976
Or she'll put a bullet in my
head the second she finds out.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.518
- Let's do this!

24:45.552 --> 24:47.920
Can I get another shot
of Mr. Pink Jackpot?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.756
- Might wanna pace
yourself there, big guy.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.624
You don't wanna finish early.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.026
- Hey baby, I'm always
the last one to finish.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.996
Usually when the other
racers have finished two,

24:57.029 --> 24:58.698
three times.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.634
- I'd rather finish
myself I think.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.937
- Hey doll, it's way more
fun to finish together.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.206
Come on, we could
do it right now.

25:07.239 --> 25:11.578
You, me, that little
bathroom over there, come on.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.214
- You're not even
close to being my type.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.016
- What's your type, huh?

25:17.049 --> 25:18.818
The shaman of sexy?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.220
The midnight delight?

25:21.253 --> 25:24.591
Come on, what could be
more your type, baby girl?

25:24.624 --> 25:27.727
- Uh, someone with an
IQ in the triple digits,

25:27.760 --> 25:29.629
who doesn't smell or look
like he just stepped out

25:29.662 --> 25:32.565
of a Hollister
store, like Tyler.

25:32.599 --> 25:35.167
- You're way out of
luck on that one, baby.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.036
Boy Tyler likes
girls like Karen,

25:37.069 --> 25:40.773
you know blonde, big
tits, tiny waist.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.242
- Gee, thanks Craig.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.647
- Why don't you come to
the bathroom with me?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.882
Introduce me to the twins.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.118
Hey, I'd be happy
to kiss the girls.

25:52.151 --> 25:55.087
- No one wants to go to the
bathroom with you Craig, okay?

25:55.121 --> 25:57.056
What's wrong with
all these guys?

25:57.089 --> 25:58.758
Why are you wearing two shirts?

25:58.791 --> 26:00.292
- Because it's cool.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.831
- If I wanted them kissed,
I'd kiss them myself.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.032
- Prove it.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.333
- Not literally.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.070
- Karen, if they really
wanted you kissing them,

26:11.103 --> 26:13.673
they wouldn't be staring at me.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.242
- Oh my God, he's such a douche.

26:17.644 --> 26:18.945
- And you're a bitch.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.049
- Look man, Sandra
would probably kill you

26:23.082 --> 26:24.016
if you don't do it.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.050
- Yeah.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.888
God, look I'm...

26:30.356 --> 26:32.358
Look, you're a good
friend, I'm sorry,

26:32.391 --> 26:33.760
I didn't mean to make
this all about me.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.195
This whole job thing
must be eating you up.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.065
Do you need anything from me?

26:39.098 --> 26:42.168
- Just focus on you, brother,
this is some heavy stuff.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.907
Come on, let's go back
inside, we'll get some drinks.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.241
Come on.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.946
♪ Working people, they fear

26:56.749 --> 27:00.720
♪ What, hey, I ain't your bitch

27:02.755 --> 27:04.090
Hey, what you reading Ty Ty?

27:04.123 --> 27:05.858
- Hey, easy, come on.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.359
- Ooh, what a secret, huh?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.862
Come on, you can trust me.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.298
We used to sell investigations
for the FBI.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.299
- Are you drunk?

27:13.332 --> 27:14.667
It's what, it's not even...

27:14.701 --> 27:15.735
- Nah, nah, I'm just
getting started.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.136
Come on, what's this all about?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.338
- I'll tell you later, I've
got an announcement to make.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.440
- Okay, whatever, just let
me know if you need to talk.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.011
- Well I appreciate that,
Bill, that's really nice.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.947
Listen, Craig and Jackie,
what's the deal there?

27:27.980 --> 27:28.881
- Craig?

27:28.915 --> 27:30.850
- Yeah, the muscular gentleman.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.285
- Who knows, I heard
last summer he got a DUI,

27:33.319 --> 27:34.887
he shouldn't even be here.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.956
- Like I'm gonna miss the
last night at Mr. Phils?

27:36.989 --> 27:38.925
Come on, this is my spot.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.761
- It could be your last
if you're not careful.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.896
- Make me my drink, woman, okay?

27:43.930 --> 27:46.799
What are you a cop
or a bartender?

27:50.202 --> 27:51.738
- What are you, a creamsicle?

27:51.771 --> 27:54.040
- You want the stick?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.809
- What, Popsicle
sticks aren't even big.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.778
- Well mine's a jumbo.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.346
- It's a fudgicle.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.915
- If that's what you're into.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.052
- Oh, okay, you're into Jackie?

28:06.085 --> 28:06.919
- Yeah.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.054
- Yeah?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.088
- Yeah.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.761
Easy.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.262
- Ow, ow, relax man,
you're hurting my shoulder.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.897
- Don't touch the hair.

28:17.930 --> 28:21.233
- Damn, geez, where'd you
learn that Bruce Lee shit?

28:21.267 --> 28:23.069
- My father taught me.

28:23.102 --> 28:27.239
Craig and Jackie, seriously,
are they together?

28:27.273 --> 28:28.207
- What, together?

28:28.240 --> 28:29.141
- Yeah.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.977
- No, no, in Craig's dreams,

28:31.010 --> 28:32.979
if he's smart enough
to even have one.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.180
- All right, good.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.448
- So you want me to
set it up with Jackie?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.851
- No, no, I don't want that,
I'm perfectly capable...

28:38.885 --> 28:39.886
- Come on, I got your
back, I'll handle it.

28:39.919 --> 28:40.753
- No.

28:40.787 --> 28:41.420
- Yeah.

28:41.453 --> 28:42.288
- No.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.222
- Yes.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.090
- Bill, don't, don't do this.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.792
Don't, don't, don't.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.027
Um, shit, he's going there.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.033
- What?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.868
- Tyler's into you.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.069
- You're lying.

28:57.103 --> 28:57.904
- No, he told me to
come over here and

28:57.937 --> 28:59.238
talk to you for him.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.472
- Why are you telling me?

29:00.506 --> 29:03.309
It's not like you're a
good guy or anything.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.244
- Look, I know I have
my faults, all right?

29:05.277 --> 29:08.380
But I always stick
up for my friends.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.787
There's always one guy in
a bar who knows everybody,

29:14.821 --> 29:16.288
and everything that's going on.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.168
- After everything
I've done for you!

29:37.576 --> 29:41.513
- You know I've come here
every Friday night since 1997,

29:41.547 --> 29:43.549
when Mr. Phil opened up.

29:45.885 --> 29:50.022
And a little piss ant like you
ain't gonna ruin my streak.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.458
Hey Jackie, bring me my usual.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.161
Are we clear?

29:58.430 --> 29:59.430
- Yes, yes.

30:00.599 --> 30:01.599
- Saloom.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.320
- You're a dead man.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.972
I was just thinking about you.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.509
Yeah, he's here.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.946
He's talking to her a lot.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.582
I really wanna see you.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.252
Oh, I don't know.

30:54.653 --> 30:58.224
I don't think tonight's
the right night.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.426
No, no, I do wanna see you.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.398
Will you dress up for me again?

31:08.935 --> 31:12.604
No, baby please, no, you
should not come here.

31:16.976 --> 31:21.047
Okay, if you're sure it
can't wait, I'll be here.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.683
Yeah, yeah.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.716
Okay, bye.

32:01.187 --> 32:02.021
- What's up buddy?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.322
- What's up bro?

32:04.523 --> 32:06.592
Not much, how's it going?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.499
- Is that the blond
from the baseball game?

32:13.532 --> 32:14.700
- Hmm?

32:14.733 --> 32:16.568
- You don't have to tell me,
if you want a gorgeous blond,

32:16.602 --> 32:19.671
Karen's tits are a
whole other level.

32:21.307 --> 32:25.444
- Nah man, I dropped that
blonde a long time ago.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.712
- So who was on the phone?

32:26.745 --> 32:28.614
- It's just some dude.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.517
- What dude?

32:31.550 --> 32:32.718
A telemarketer?

32:32.751 --> 32:35.687
- No, some guy, getting
work done on the car,

32:35.721 --> 32:37.256
just boring shit.

32:39.125 --> 32:42.061
- Hmm, you ride a motorcycle.

32:42.094 --> 32:45.331
- I know, exactly, I'm
getting tired of the bike,

32:45.364 --> 32:47.133
it's time to take the
car out of the garage.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.068
- Okay then, man, sometimes
you just wanna relax

32:49.101 --> 32:51.670
in some AC on the
commute, right?

32:54.773 --> 32:57.609
What about, how come you
didn't take it to Larry?

32:57.643 --> 32:59.211
What, he's not good
enough for you?

32:59.245 --> 33:02.381
- Larry's fine, I just
needed something special,

33:02.414 --> 33:04.316
this guy's good with rims.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.384
- You mean like rim jobs?

33:08.487 --> 33:09.788
- Maybe if you
gave more rim jobs.

33:09.821 --> 33:13.159
- Oh, no, don't tell me
about your deep dark secrets,

33:13.192 --> 33:14.393
all right, guy?

33:50.296 --> 33:53.299
- Well, speaking of secrets,

33:53.332 --> 33:56.435
you thought about what
you're gonna say to Tammy?

33:56.468 --> 33:58.404
- I don't know,
it's just something

33:58.437 --> 33:59.538
you can't really
rehearse, you know?

33:59.571 --> 34:02.341
So I figured I'd
just kind of wing it.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.442
- I feel you.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.746
- All right, let's
assume for argument sake

34:08.780 --> 34:11.750
that I thought you telling
her was an okay idea.

34:11.783 --> 34:12.783
- Yeah.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.388
- About doing it?

34:16.422 --> 34:18.290
- Well you told Sandra
you'd tell Tammy tonight.

34:18.324 --> 34:22.228
- Yeah, I'm speaking hypothetically,
I know what I said.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.062
- Well, I don't know.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.699
It seems like you should
invite me over for dinner.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.835
- To my place?

34:29.868 --> 34:32.771
- Yeah, your
conflict, your place.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.440
- Okay.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.309
- Okay, you send me the invite,

34:37.342 --> 34:38.844
Tammy makes my favorite dish,

34:38.877 --> 34:42.181
lemon chicken and
roasted mushrooms.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.315
- Good enough, sounds a
little lightweight but

34:44.350 --> 34:46.585
I'm still listening.

34:46.618 --> 34:49.655
- And that's it, I
tell her over dinner.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.257
It's not gonna be easy,

34:51.290 --> 34:53.692
it certainly makes
you look like a pansy.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.261
- Yeah, I'm not really
concerned about that, all right?

34:55.293 --> 34:57.696
I just don't wanna hurt her.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.666
- Wait, you actually
care about her?

35:02.168 --> 35:05.471
- Yeah, I'm not a complete
asshole, all right?

35:08.307 --> 35:09.875
So you think it will work?

35:09.908 --> 35:11.910
- Well I'm not sure,
but I think it'll get us

35:11.943 --> 35:15.747
through that experience that
will get you killed by Tammy.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.383
- Well, I like it.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.221
- Yeah?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.655
You wanna take some
time to think it over?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.891
Maybe when you haven't
had a few drinks?

35:25.924 --> 35:28.760
- I'm the same
sober as I am drunk.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.462
Sounds like a plan.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.400
- And what about Sandy?

35:34.433 --> 35:36.235
- I'll run it by her.

35:40.306 --> 35:43.409
And I'll send
Karen over for you.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.442
- Wonderful.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.445
- What sarcasm from Fernie?

35:50.749 --> 35:52.518
Karen, can I steal Sandy
away from you for a moment,

35:52.551 --> 35:55.687
please, I promise
I'll be forever yours.

35:55.721 --> 35:57.689
- But promise me to
never call me baby.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.458
- Whatever it takes.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.729
Okay, here me out for a second.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.397
- This doesn't feel good.

36:05.431 --> 36:08.534
- Okay, Fernie and I have
decided that it'd be best

36:08.567 --> 36:10.236
if he told Tammy.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.303
- Him, wait, why him?

36:11.337 --> 36:12.338
- Shh!

36:12.371 --> 36:14.406
Lower your voice, okay?

36:14.440 --> 36:15.841
- Explain.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.809
- Okay, well he's my best
friend and he's known Tammy

36:17.843 --> 36:19.811
for a long time so we
figured that it'd be best

36:19.845 --> 36:22.681
if he told Tammy, that way I
could avoid being murdered.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.583
- If she's gonna kill
you, she's gonna kill you.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.418
What difference does it make?

36:26.452 --> 36:28.954
- You are remarkably
callus about my death.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.656
- You promised you'd
tell her tonight.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.691
- We've been married
for four years, okay?

36:32.724 --> 36:34.960
I can't just throw that away.

36:34.993 --> 36:38.697
- Bill, sweetheart,
do you love me?

36:38.730 --> 36:40.266
- Do I...

36:40.299 --> 36:42.768
Yeah, that's why this
is such a big deal.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.471
- Are you attracted to me?

36:45.504 --> 36:46.472
- Yeah.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.873
- Like, sexually?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.543
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.978
- Mmm hmm, say it.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.715
- Baby, I am so
attracted to you.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.586
Your heart, it's
your tender heart.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.456
- Make love to me, right now.

37:04.490 --> 37:09.295
- What, like right now, like
on this table right now?

37:09.328 --> 37:10.328
- Bathroom.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.931
- Okay.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.966
- You still find me sexy
even though I'm pregnant?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.903
- Our baby is the most
important thing in my life.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.005
- That's the man I
fell in love with.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.740
Five minutes, okay?

37:28.647 --> 37:30.316
- Give me the usual.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.483
- In a minute.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.351
- I got it.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.753
- Bill, there you are.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.388
Weren't you supposed to
talk to me about something?

37:36.422 --> 37:38.590
- Wait, no, wait, not
right now, I'm busy,

37:38.624 --> 37:39.525
talk to Karen.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.726
- Busy with what, drinking?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.661
- No, Sandy wants
the D right now.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.630
- This Karen chick is an idiot.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.332
- Not even close to
my problem, all right?

37:46.365 --> 37:47.533
Besides, look at her tits.

37:47.566 --> 37:50.302
- You do still want me to help
you with Tammy, don't you?

37:50.336 --> 37:51.737
- Come on man, give
me five minutes.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.904
- Five minutes.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.072
- Five.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.374
- You're fast.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.476
- Only when I have to be.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.812
- I'm starting the clock.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.626
- Wait, did you put
the sign on the door?

38:14.660 --> 38:15.494
- Hmm?

38:15.527 --> 38:16.362
- The sign?

38:16.395 --> 38:17.796
- Yeah, of course.

38:20.699 --> 38:23.435
- Oh God, I wanted you bad.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.102
- We got two minutes.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.937
- Wait, what?

38:25.971 --> 38:28.540
- Take it slow, baby.

38:28.574 --> 38:29.574
- Two minutes.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.415
It's been like three seconds.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.085
- You turn me on so much.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.687
- Really?

38:41.720 --> 38:42.720
- Uh huh.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.562
- Hey Jack.

38:53.131 --> 38:56.468
Bring me those
crosswords, will ya?

39:20.826 --> 39:22.594
- Who cares if there was no
weapons of mass destruction.

39:22.628 --> 39:25.130
We brought down a
dangerous dictator.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.499
- That depends,
dangerous to whom?

39:27.533 --> 39:28.600
- Whom, whom?

39:30.902 --> 39:32.738
How you learn to
talk like that, girl?

39:32.771 --> 39:35.774
- I'm sorry, am I supposed to
be an idiot with nice tits?

39:35.807 --> 39:39.478
- No, I'm sorry about that,
I was just being an idiot.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.146
- Yeah, well a lot of
guys don't like girls

39:41.179 --> 39:42.548
to use their brains.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.483
- No, you really
shouldn't do that.

39:44.516 --> 39:47.686
You're turning me on with
all this intellectual shit.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.854
- Are you hitting on me?

39:48.887 --> 39:51.657
- I swear, if Bill
and Sandra weren't in

39:51.690 --> 39:52.691
that bathroom right now.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.892
- Come on.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.562
- What, who better to
go back there with?

39:56.595 --> 39:58.997
What, is Craig more your type?

40:03.134 --> 40:04.135
- Hey, baby.

40:05.471 --> 40:06.838
- Hi.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.140
- I was just admiring your
skirt, what's your name?

40:09.174 --> 40:10.075
- Leela.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.108
- Leela!

40:11.910 --> 40:13.845
I love the way you
put your L's together.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.013
- You're cute.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.214
- Thanks.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.117
So about that skirt,
is it a space skirt?

40:19.150 --> 40:22.120
Because I'd love
to dock on Uranus.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.459
Hate to see you go but
love to watch you leave.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.663
- Peach schnapps, really?

40:31.697 --> 40:33.098
- For Tyler maybe.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.201
Okay, I can see that.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.638
But it looks like Jackie's
got dibs on him, so.

40:39.671 --> 40:40.671
- So, what?

40:41.940 --> 40:42.874
I'm supposed to sleep with you

40:42.908 --> 40:45.210
due to process of elimination?

40:45.243 --> 40:46.678
God forbid I'm here
just to have a good time

40:46.712 --> 40:47.946
with my friends, huh?

40:47.979 --> 40:50.582
I must need to hook
up someone tonight.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.083
- Girl, all those syllables.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.585
- God, whatever.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.589
- No, you shouldn't
have sex with me out

40:57.623 --> 40:59.024
of process of elimination,

40:59.057 --> 41:00.826
you should have sex with
me because you know I could

41:00.859 --> 41:02.928
make you, you know.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.530
- Fall asleep.

41:04.563 --> 41:08.099
- No, the opposite, I can
make you come real hard.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.968
- Oh my God, that's horrible,

41:10.001 --> 41:11.570
that can't actually
work on anyone.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.972
- All right, you
have your doubts,

41:14.005 --> 41:15.941
but a week from now
you'll be stalking me.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.710
Outside of my apartment
with binoculars on.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.879
- Okay, that sounds like
a restraining order,

41:20.912 --> 41:22.080
doesn't it?

41:22.113 --> 41:23.248
- Don't knock it
until you try it.

41:23.281 --> 41:24.482
- Oh my God.

41:25.551 --> 41:28.720
- Ladies, you're just in time.

41:28.754 --> 41:30.556
You got two free tickets
to ride on the Craig train,

41:30.589 --> 41:31.957
non stop to pound town.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.859
All aboard, toot toot!

41:34.726 --> 41:35.927
- You're gross!

41:37.028 --> 41:38.530
- So just you then?

41:38.564 --> 41:39.564
- Ew, die.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.033
- Gosh.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.269
- Whatever baby, once
we get married it will

41:44.302 --> 41:46.905
just all be part of our story.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.240
Target acquired.

41:59.084 --> 42:03.054
- You know what really
just turned me on?

42:03.088 --> 42:04.222
- My enormous member?

42:05.657 --> 42:08.594
- No, I was thinking
about our future.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.030
- Yeah?

42:12.063 --> 42:13.264
- Yeah, we're gonna
have like a huge house,

42:13.298 --> 42:17.636
and lots of kids, and a huge
wedding and Christmas parties.

42:17.669 --> 42:20.338
- Hold on, hold on,
hold on a second.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.371
- What?

42:23.274 --> 42:26.612
- Look, let's take
on thing at a time.

42:29.615 --> 42:30.982
- Wait, what do you mean?

42:31.016 --> 42:33.785
Like we just had sex, I
mean, if you call it that.

42:33.819 --> 42:35.854
- Okay, there's a lot to...

42:35.887 --> 42:38.123
It's not that simple,
it's not that easy.

42:40.626 --> 42:43.595
- Hey, hey, come
on, can we talk?

42:43.629 --> 42:44.629
Sandy?

42:46.832 --> 42:47.833
- Oh my God.

42:48.934 --> 42:49.768
- Ooh, baby.

42:49.801 --> 42:50.736
- Ooh, you are big.

42:50.769 --> 42:51.929
- That's right, girl for you.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.279
- Ah, okay, whoa guys,.

43:01.312 --> 43:02.748
- I know man, I lost track.

43:02.781 --> 43:03.749
Are you guys done?

43:03.782 --> 43:04.816
- Almost.

43:04.850 --> 43:05.717
- We're you guys...

43:05.751 --> 43:06.852
- Uh huh.

43:06.885 --> 43:09.955
- What, are you
gonna not talk to me?

43:09.988 --> 43:11.389
What, you're not
gonna talk to me?

43:11.422 --> 43:13.224
- Well that depends on you.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.826
- Look, what do
you want from me?

43:14.860 --> 43:16.594
- You're an asshole.

43:17.295 --> 43:18.295
- Sandy!

43:19.998 --> 43:20.998
Sandra!

43:52.397 --> 43:54.065
What in god's name.

43:56.768 --> 43:58.036
- That bad, huh?

44:01.472 --> 44:04.409
- Look at you,
what's the occasion?

44:05.844 --> 44:06.978
- You like it?

44:09.180 --> 44:11.316
- Uh, yeah, like it, yeah.

44:14.185 --> 44:18.323
- I dress up for you, and you
think you're hallucinating.

44:20.125 --> 44:23.194
- Come on babe,
you're turning me on.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.299
- So this is what you want?

44:28.333 --> 44:31.169
Me to dress like a whore?

44:31.202 --> 44:32.971
- You put the clothes
on, I can't help myself.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.444
You're hot, that's
why I married you.

44:43.148 --> 44:45.884
- God, those are bigger
than I ever imagined.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.919
- You've been fantasizing
about me, huh?

44:47.953 --> 44:49.187
- Si Mamasita, Si.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.823
- I can't stop staring at you.

44:53.191 --> 44:57.195
- You haven't looked at
me like that since Cabo.

45:04.102 --> 45:05.336
What!

45:05.370 --> 45:08.139
- No hey, wait, wait, no!

45:08.173 --> 45:09.173
Get off!

45:11.409 --> 45:13.711
What is going on in here!

45:14.946 --> 45:16.848
Get off him, you whore!

45:18.917 --> 45:19.917
Bitch!

45:21.086 --> 45:23.021
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

45:24.289 --> 45:26.257
- Yes, kill each other!

45:29.160 --> 45:30.228
Cat fight!

45:40.438 --> 45:41.506
- Stop, stop!

45:43.842 --> 45:45.176
Stop!

45:45.210 --> 45:47.212
- Ow, god damn it, Bill!

45:48.346 --> 45:51.116
- What the hell is
wrong with you guys?

45:51.149 --> 45:54.019
It's our last night, holy shit.

45:54.052 --> 45:57.055
- If you ever touch me
again, I will kill you!

45:57.088 --> 45:59.224
- She's a god damn psycho.

46:00.358 --> 46:02.527
- And how dare you touch her.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.296
She's probably
carrying diseases.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.332
- Okay, why do you even
care who he sleeps with?

46:07.365 --> 46:09.100
- That's a good question.

46:09.134 --> 46:12.303
- Because he's my
husbands best friend,

46:12.337 --> 46:14.139
and he's a bad influence.

46:14.172 --> 46:16.174
- Okay, that literally
makes no sense.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.977
And you put your hands
on a pregnant lady.

46:19.010 --> 46:20.278
- You're pregnant?

46:20.311 --> 46:22.213
With Fernando's baby?

46:22.247 --> 46:24.415
- Sandra's pregnant,
and it's Bill's.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.787
So suck on that.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.092
- It's not true.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.461
- It's true.

46:38.897 --> 46:40.565
- How could you, Bill?

46:42.533 --> 46:43.869
- Look, I was gonna
tell you tonight,

46:43.902 --> 46:46.337
I just found out
about the pregnancy.

46:46.371 --> 46:48.206
- Are you in love with her?

46:48.239 --> 46:50.175
- Look, Tammy, we've
been having problems,

46:50.208 --> 46:53.044
and not being able
to get pregnant.

46:53.078 --> 46:54.345
- Do you not love me anymore?

46:59.217 --> 47:00.585
- We have a lot to discuss.

47:00.618 --> 47:04.055
- Oh yeah, you mean you
have a lot to answer for.

47:04.089 --> 47:05.590
- You know, hold on.

47:05.623 --> 47:09.394
Why'd you act like
a lunatic just now?

47:09.427 --> 47:11.629
- I have to gather my thoughts.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.031
- No, I don't think so,

47:13.064 --> 47:14.399
why do you care
who Fernie bangs?

47:14.432 --> 47:16.467
And don't tell me because
he's a bad influence.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.603
- I am not the one
who's in trouble here.

47:18.636 --> 47:20.205
- No Tammy, hey, come...

47:20.238 --> 47:21.572
- Leave me alone!

47:54.539 --> 47:56.507
- Did you guys see
the look in her eyes?

47:56.541 --> 47:58.944
I'm surprised we're
all still alive.

47:58.977 --> 48:00.545
- You're telling me.

48:00.578 --> 48:01.947
- Did you see it, Ty?

48:01.980 --> 48:04.950
- I heard it, but I
was talking to Jackie.

48:04.983 --> 48:06.417
- Jackie, Jackie, you're
always talking to Jackie.

48:06.451 --> 48:08.419
Listen guys, be warned,

48:08.453 --> 48:11.056
all women go crazy eventually.

48:12.157 --> 48:13.258
- To hit and quit.

48:15.260 --> 48:17.662
- I mean, it's not that
bad, it's just a little cut.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.998
- A little cut, that's
easy for you to say,

48:20.031 --> 48:21.232
you don't have a mark on you.

48:21.266 --> 48:22.533
- Yeah, but I'm gonna
have nightmares about

48:22.567 --> 48:24.402
that glare for weeks.

48:24.435 --> 48:27.372
- Dude, that is a crazy bitch.

48:27.405 --> 48:30.275
- Did you seriously have to
tell her about me and Bill?

48:30.308 --> 48:32.177
And the baby, no less.

48:32.210 --> 48:35.080
- Look sweetie, I'm
sorry, but the truth was

48:35.113 --> 48:36.347
going to come out anyway,

48:36.381 --> 48:38.249
and that's a lot of pressure,

48:38.283 --> 48:41.419
and you know, the
cork's gonna pop.

48:41.452 --> 48:42.452
- Yeah.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.929
- So come out with it, Fernie.

48:53.598 --> 48:54.699
Why'd Tammy lose her
shit when she heard

48:54.732 --> 48:56.501
you were banging Karen?

48:56.534 --> 48:58.469
- Pretty obvious, dude.

49:00.538 --> 49:01.538
- Is it?

49:03.474 --> 49:06.211
- Come on, don't make me say it.

49:10.581 --> 49:13.651
Tammy's had a thing
for me for years.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.322
You must've seen it.

49:17.355 --> 49:20.725
- You know, I think a
reaction like that's a little,

49:20.758 --> 49:22.127
a little much, huh?

49:22.160 --> 49:23.628
- Yeah, well you
said it yourself.

49:23.661 --> 49:24.962
She's psycho.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.247
- Here we go again.

49:42.280 --> 49:46.751
- What's wrong Alex, not used
to men walking towards you?

49:46.784 --> 49:50.488
- If I were you, I would
stop picking on me.

49:50.521 --> 49:54.259
- If I were you, I would
stop picking on me.

49:59.364 --> 50:02.733
- Okay, what, I haven't
even said anything yet.

50:02.767 --> 50:04.302
- Good job with
the fight, Craig.

50:04.335 --> 50:05.636
- What, huh?

50:05.670 --> 50:07.238
- What, huh?

50:07.272 --> 50:09.774
You yelled out cat fight
like some stupid frat boy.

50:09.807 --> 50:13.078
- I represent.

50:13.111 --> 50:14.279
Huh!

50:14.312 --> 50:16.181
Come on baby, that's
exactly what it was.

50:16.214 --> 50:19.184
Besides, I did way more
than he did to break it up.

50:19.217 --> 50:21.286
- All right, I'm going on my
break, you guys need anything?

50:21.319 --> 50:23.388
- No Jackie, I'm
good, thank you.

50:23.421 --> 50:27.292
- I'm always good, but
you all ready knew that.

50:27.325 --> 50:29.360
- It never ends.

50:29.394 --> 50:32.230
- How'd you know girl, you
ain't even seen it yet?

50:34.732 --> 50:37.135
You get it, right?

50:37.168 --> 50:39.537
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.372
- Man, I'm the
funniest guy here.

50:41.406 --> 50:44.475
- You're the funniest
guy at the bar.

50:44.509 --> 50:45.643
- Only if you count
the guys that are

50:45.676 --> 50:47.845
trying to be funny though.

50:47.878 --> 50:52.150
But I am the best looking,
biggest catch at the bar.

50:52.183 --> 50:54.419
Like the Moby Dick of bros.

50:56.221 --> 50:58.689
I'm Broby Dick, that's awesome.

51:02.193 --> 51:05.130
- You got nice cheekbones.

51:05.163 --> 51:06.297
- Thanks, bro.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.534
No really, that's awesome.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.436
You know, it takes a man
who's real secure in his

51:11.469 --> 51:14.272
masculinity to compliment
another mans looks.

51:14.305 --> 51:15.606
I respect that.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.442
- No, I'm not too shabby myself,

51:17.475 --> 51:21.546
so it's not like we're going
to compete with each other.

51:21.579 --> 51:23.414
- Exactly, bro.

51:23.448 --> 51:27.585
I'm hot and you're hot, plenty
enough of us to go around.

51:29.354 --> 51:31.522
- Well you're in good
shape, I'll tell you that.

51:31.556 --> 51:33.124
- Thanks, man.

51:33.158 --> 51:36.461
Just a few hours in the
gym each day, you know?

51:36.494 --> 51:38.163
We should go together.

51:38.196 --> 51:39.330
- Really?

51:39.364 --> 51:41.466
- Of course man,
let's get that pump.

51:41.499 --> 51:42.433
- Yeah, we'll do
that, we can do that.

51:42.467 --> 51:45.836
- Yeah, it'll be great
dude, it'll be awesome.

51:45.870 --> 51:49.840
- Um, now you and Jackie,
is there something going on?

51:49.874 --> 51:50.741
- Oh, with her?

51:50.775 --> 51:51.775
- Yeah.

51:53.711 --> 51:57.382
- I mean, just your
average guy meets girl,

51:58.783 --> 52:02.753
you know, then guy hits
on girl, girl slaps boy.

52:04.889 --> 52:06.391
Rinse and repeat.

52:07.625 --> 52:11.496
But one day, one day
she'll realize that

52:11.529 --> 52:13.631
she wants the Craigster.

52:13.664 --> 52:15.166
- I can see that.

52:16.434 --> 52:18.436
- I mean, you did see
the way she referenced

52:18.469 --> 52:19.504
my love muscle.

52:19.537 --> 52:21.206
- Yeah, we all did.

52:23.541 --> 52:27.878
- Okay, I can't, I'm
pulling your dick, bro.

52:27.912 --> 52:29.914
She can't stand me at all.

52:36.721 --> 52:39.924
I have seen her
checking you out though.

52:39.957 --> 52:41.259
- Well I don't know
about all that.

52:41.292 --> 52:42.660
- I do, bro, I seen it!

52:42.693 --> 52:43.794
- Really?

52:43.828 --> 52:46.697
- Yeah man, you
could tap that ass.

52:47.965 --> 52:49.834
What's stopping you?

52:49.867 --> 52:51.569
- I'm not like you.

52:52.703 --> 52:55.740
- You know what,
I'll be your mentor,

52:55.773 --> 52:57.775
and your best bro.

52:57.808 --> 53:00.478
I will be your Brobi Wan Kenobi.

53:01.579 --> 53:04.549
- And I could be
your Luke Guywalker.

53:06.751 --> 53:07.818
- It's a start.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.987
No, I mean, it's
your first time.

53:10.020 --> 53:10.855
- That was my first one.

53:10.888 --> 53:11.722
- Exactly.

53:11.756 --> 53:12.690
- They'll get better.

53:12.723 --> 53:15.460
- We'll have plenty more.

53:37.348 --> 53:39.584
- Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.

53:39.617 --> 53:41.652
- No, it's okay, I'm finished.

53:41.686 --> 53:42.587
- I'll wait outside.

53:42.620 --> 53:44.755
- Don't be silly, come in.

53:45.856 --> 53:46.856
- Jackie.

53:49.026 --> 53:52.330
- Oh my God, Tyler, do I really
have to throw myself at you

53:52.363 --> 53:53.731
to get you to notice me?

53:53.764 --> 53:56.601
- We just talked for half
an hour at the bar, I...

53:56.634 --> 54:00.738
- Tyler, I want you, I've
wanted you for weeks.

54:00.771 --> 54:02.707
You're always the best
dressed guy in the bar.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.675
- Thank you, thank you.

54:06.377 --> 54:09.647
- Come on, I'm on
break for 15 minutes.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.383
- No, this is not a
good idea, Jackie.

54:12.417 --> 54:13.951
- Oh, what's wrong?

54:13.984 --> 54:14.984
You nervous?

54:16.354 --> 54:17.488
Don't worry, I'll
take care of you.

54:17.522 --> 54:20.291
- No, yes, very,
very nervous, yes.

54:20.325 --> 54:21.526
- You wanna go back to my place?

54:21.559 --> 54:22.960
We can relax properly?

54:22.993 --> 54:25.696
- Jackie, I'm not interested.

54:25.730 --> 54:26.564
- I don't get it.

54:26.597 --> 54:28.399
- It's not you.

54:28.433 --> 54:29.066
- What, you're married?

54:29.099 --> 54:30.099
- No, God.

54:31.101 --> 54:32.470
- Don't you like me?

54:32.503 --> 54:34.572
- Yes Jackie, I
like you very much.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.006
- I mean, my breasts
aren't bad either, right?

54:36.040 --> 54:37.408
I've been told they're
pretty fantastic.

54:37.442 --> 54:39.410
- They're awesome,
they're beautiful.

54:39.444 --> 54:41.512
Please put them away.

54:41.546 --> 54:43.714
- I don't believe you.

54:43.748 --> 54:47.385
- It's not you, Jackie,
it's nothing personal.

54:47.418 --> 54:49.987
- What, you like somebody
else, Karen, Sandy?

54:50.020 --> 54:51.021
- No, oh no.

54:52.590 --> 54:55.760
- They're pretty hot,
dude, I'd do them.

54:55.793 --> 54:56.627
- I should go.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.795
- No, I'll go.

54:59.430 --> 55:01.932
I mean, you've gotta pee, right?

55:03.100 --> 55:04.469
- Jackie, give me that back.
- What's this?

55:04.502 --> 55:05.370
- Jackie!

55:05.403 --> 55:07.338
- Wait, stop screaming!

55:08.506 --> 55:11.108
- Oh my God, it's
a suicide note!

55:11.141 --> 55:13.544
Tyler, you need
to call a hotline.

55:13.578 --> 55:16.447
I knew it, you had
to be depressed.

55:16.481 --> 55:18.549
- It's not a suicide note.

55:18.583 --> 55:21.752
- You're not alone,
we're here with you.

55:21.786 --> 55:23.388
- Give me the note, Jackie.

55:23.421 --> 55:25.790
- You have so much to live
for, to throw it all away.

55:25.823 --> 55:26.857
We're gonna get you help.
- I don't wanna die!

55:26.891 --> 55:28.092
I don't wanna die!

55:28.125 --> 55:30.795
- Nobody wants you
to, you're loved.

55:30.828 --> 55:31.762
- You're not listening
to me, Jackie.

55:31.796 --> 55:33.531
- I'm not gonna stand
by and let this happen.

55:33.564 --> 55:37.101
- Jackie, I like me,
okay, I like me, I'm gay!

55:37.134 --> 55:39.103
It's not you, it is me.

55:44.074 --> 55:45.074
- Wow.

55:52.683 --> 55:56.821
Okay, okay, well everything
makes so much more sense.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.789
You could've told me
this three weeks ago.

55:58.823 --> 55:59.990
- Well nobody knows.

56:00.024 --> 56:04.795
My aunt knows, I told her I'd
kill her if she told anyone.

56:04.829 --> 56:07.798
- That's overreacting
a little bit.

56:07.832 --> 56:09.400
Wait, are you threatening me?

56:09.434 --> 56:12.102
- No, and tonight was the
night I was coming out,

56:12.136 --> 56:14.038
and I was nervous and I
just wrote some stuff down,

56:14.071 --> 56:15.773
and that's the note.

56:15.806 --> 56:18.142
That's what that note is.

56:18.175 --> 56:21.045
- Aw, that takes
a lot of courage.

56:23.914 --> 56:25.683
And I am relieved because
if you were straight

56:25.716 --> 56:28.586
and rejected me, I'd
probably binge on ice cream

56:28.619 --> 56:30.455
for the next two weeks.

56:30.488 --> 56:31.689
- Be right there with you,

56:31.722 --> 56:32.923
there's another secret
that's not in the note.

56:32.957 --> 56:34.492
- Oh.

56:34.525 --> 56:36.894
- Well I come up here
every night to see Craig.

56:40.665 --> 56:41.799
- Wow.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.434
- Are you kidding?

56:45.570 --> 56:48.539
Okay, I'm sorry, is
my mascara running?

56:48.573 --> 56:50.441
- No, it looks good.

56:50.475 --> 56:51.976
- I'm not laughing
at you, I promise.

56:52.009 --> 56:55.045
But maybe finally now,
Craig will get some action.

56:56.681 --> 56:58.916
- Not even now, I'd never
talked to him until tonight,

56:58.949 --> 56:59.917
he's kind of an ass.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.786
- Uh yeah, no kidding.

57:03.488 --> 57:04.855
- Could you do me a favor?

57:04.889 --> 57:09.059
Don't tell anyone until I
make my announcement, okay?

57:09.093 --> 57:10.661
- Cross my heart.

57:12.196 --> 57:14.799
You're a really
sweet guy, Tyler.

57:14.832 --> 57:15.833
Last chance.

57:17.034 --> 57:21.205
- I'm good, and you're pretty,
and all of that is awesome,

57:21.238 --> 57:22.507
but you know.

57:24.174 --> 57:26.744
- Okay, I'll leave it alone
but if you ever want to

57:26.777 --> 57:30.147
experiment, you know
where to find me.

57:30.180 --> 57:32.116
- But that in the bank.

57:40.124 --> 57:42.560
- Holy shit, bro, bro, bro!

57:43.828 --> 57:46.664
Hey, you did not just hit that?

57:46.697 --> 57:47.532
- Hit what?

57:47.565 --> 57:48.833
- Jackie man!

57:48.866 --> 57:50.234
Dude I saw her coming
out of the bathroom,

57:50.267 --> 57:53.571
fixing her jacket and her apron.

57:53.604 --> 57:57.207
Dude, the sign, I
know what you did!

57:57.241 --> 58:01.145
- Yeah, it was great Craig,
she had long breasts.

58:01.178 --> 58:02.747
- Long tits?

58:02.780 --> 58:06.751
No shit, like how long
though, like out here?

58:06.784 --> 58:09.019
- Like long, erect nipples.

58:10.555 --> 58:12.623
- Okay, awesome, did she?

58:14.759 --> 58:16.060
Come on, did she?

58:18.629 --> 58:21.599
You know, the face, the...

58:23.801 --> 58:25.002
Yeah, she did!

58:25.035 --> 58:27.171
Yeah, I know she did, yes!

58:28.205 --> 58:31.008
Oh dude, I'm not
jealous or anything man.

58:31.041 --> 58:33.510
I have a really healthy ego.

58:35.145 --> 58:37.982
Man, honestly I'd
like some advice.

58:38.015 --> 58:40.618
Like what's your secret, bro?

58:40.651 --> 58:42.152
- Just be yourself.

58:47.958 --> 58:49.326
- What?

58:49.359 --> 58:52.296
- Don't what us, you just had
sex with Tyler, didn't you?

58:52.329 --> 58:53.329
- Oh, stop.

58:54.732 --> 58:57.101
- Oh my god girl, you
don't cover up well at all.

58:57.134 --> 58:58.736
- No, we didn't, I swear.

58:58.769 --> 59:01.305
We were in there together
and we just talked.

59:01.338 --> 59:02.773
- What you talk about, huh?

59:02.807 --> 59:04.174
His favorite position?

59:04.208 --> 59:08.679
- No, I swear to god, we
talked about authenticity.

59:08.713 --> 59:09.847
- You are full of shit.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.782
- So what's he like?

59:11.816 --> 59:14.051
- Is his dick as
big as I imagined?

59:14.084 --> 59:16.787
- Guys, I can't really
get into this right now.

59:16.821 --> 59:18.923
- So it was like straight,
or is it crooked?

59:18.956 --> 59:20.057
Because sometimes
when it's crooked it

59:20.090 --> 59:21.959
just hits that little
spot, you know.

59:21.992 --> 59:25.329
- Oh my God, we
literally just talked.

59:25.362 --> 59:28.232
Trust me, it will
make sense later.

59:28.265 --> 59:32.136
- It's hard to talk with
a dick in your mouth.

59:33.638 --> 59:34.638
- You guys.

59:39.209 --> 59:43.748
Um, we've been friends
for a long time, right?

59:43.781 --> 59:46.216
- Oh shit, who did you do?

59:46.250 --> 59:49.654
- No one, no, I just wanted
to get everybody together

59:49.687 --> 59:52.657
and just talk about something
that has been on my mind

59:52.690 --> 59:53.958
for a long time.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.827
And I thought it'd be
easier if I just had

59:56.861 --> 59:57.995
everyone together.

59:58.028 --> 01:00:01.131
- Well come on, come
on, out with it, man.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.068
- Guys, I'm gay.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:12.710
- Yeah, awesome, so what do
you wanna talk to us about?

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.244
- That's not really
news there, man.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.780
- Yeah, we've known for a while.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:16.947
- What?

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:18.148
What are you talking about?

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:20.250
I've got every chick
here wanting me.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.752
You guys are telling me
who to have sex with,

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:25.055
and new positions,
and drawing diagrams.

01:00:27.692 --> 01:00:28.392
- Come on man, any other
guy would've been banging

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:29.359
Jackie for years, all right.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.996
Plus you have a lilac.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.666
- It's a kerchief, it's French.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.967
- And tonight's the only
night that you've drank

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:38.869
something other than white wine.

01:00:38.903 --> 01:00:40.938
Plus we heard you
screaming in the bathroom

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.006
four minutes ago.

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:43.039
- No?

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.045
- Scream what from the bathroom?

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:49.379
- Tyler's gay.

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:52.783
- Told you everything
would make sense.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.390
- Dude, you're awesome, bro.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:02.259
- Yeah, thanks Craig.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:05.229
- No, really, you're
a true American hero.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:06.931
Like GI Bro status.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.734
First you're banging the
snot out of Jackie in

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.302
the bathroom, and then
you come over here and

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.271
you tell us all that you're gay.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:18.308
That's so good, I love you man.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:21.846
- Well I appreciate that,
Craig, that was nice.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.047
- We didn't do anything Craig.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.882
I mean, how did you
become so thick?

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:25.915
- That's what she said.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.285
- Okay, you guys are crazy.

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:29.920
- Tyler, we're
really proud of you.

01:01:29.954 --> 01:01:31.355
- Thank you.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:34.792
- You know, you're brave,
and if you ever wanna like

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:37.795
experiment maybe, like
tag team me, a couple guys

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:40.998
or something, you
know where to find me.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.968
- Well that is not
out of question.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.939
- You know, it took a lot
of guts, you're awesome.

01:01:48.973 --> 01:01:52.142
- You are awesome, thank you.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:54.111
- Sorry about the big surprise.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:55.980
- Ah, it's all
right, what are you gonna do?

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:58.248
- At least something
positive happened.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:01:59.750
- I wanna thank you guys
for sticking with me

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:03.453
and making this a
little easier on me.

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:04.321
Thank you.

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:05.354
- Wait.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:11.061
So, you're gay, you
didn't tap that ass?

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:17.101
- No, Jackie's great
but she's not my type.

01:02:18.803 --> 01:02:20.470
- Okay, what is?

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:23.273
- I don't know, you
finished drinking yet?

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:25.509
- Finished drinking?

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:28.012
I don't know, is it morning yet?

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:32.850
- Well have you ever had
the flavor of a nice Pinot

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:33.883
in your mouth?

01:02:35.552 --> 01:02:38.889
- No, actually, I'm not
really a fan of white wine

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:41.458
but sure dude, I'll try
anything once, you're buying.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.893
- He's so easy.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.886
- Hey babe, how you doing?

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.054
You all right?

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:14.024
No, no, that is not a good
idea, do not come here.

01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:17.294
No, we can talk about it later!

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:19.263
I gotta go, I gotta go.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:21.565
- Why so shady, brother?

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:23.167
What, you can't talk on the
phone in front of your friends.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.169
- That was Tammy, bro.

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.203
She's on her way back here.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:27.171
- And she called you?

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:29.073
- Oh, she's gonna call you?

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.909
She wants to talk about it.

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.310
- Well that doesn't sound good.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:37.014
- Yeah, you know her,
there's no way of knowing.

01:03:41.085 --> 01:03:45.222
- What they hell, she called
you from the parking lot.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.592
Why did you change?

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.160
- I told you not to come here.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.528
You show up dressed like that.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.163
- I need to talk to Bill.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.199
- Tammy, you cannot tell
him about us, all right?

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:56.366
He's all ready suspicious.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.635
- I'm not losing my
husband to that whore.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.270
- All right, he's my best
friend, I'm not losing that.

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:02.206
- You lost that as soon as
you started banging his wife,

01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:03.908
now didn't you?

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.043
- What are you gonna tell him?

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:08.212
- Oh, Fernie, it's
none of your business.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:09.446
- It is my business.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:12.382
- Ah, don't worry about it.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:15.652
I'll take care of
it, just relax.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.487
Hi Billy boy.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:18.889
- Hey, sweetheart.

01:04:18.923 --> 01:04:21.025
- We have a lot to
discuss, don't we?

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:22.526
- Yeah, yeah we do.

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.263
Let's discuss how hot you look,

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.032
I've never seen you
like this before.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:31.035
Give me a hard on
the size of Florida.

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:32.636
- You're as shallow as
a kiddie wading pool.

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:36.640
Can you please just be
a man for five seconds?

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:39.476
- I'll try, I can
guarantee two or three.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:42.412
- What about all this?

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:44.448
- Well we have options.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:47.151
- Options, good, what are they?

01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:51.055
- Uh, well one, we can
just completely distance

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:55.259
ourselves from the whole
situation and pay child support.

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:59.396
Two, we can accept the
child into our lives.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:02.032
Three, I can be in
the child's life

01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:05.235
and just not involve you at all.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:08.672
Or four, Sandy could
have an abortion,

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:10.607
but that would take
a lot of persuading,

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.977
and I don't see that happening.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.645
- Hmm, so in all four
of these scenarios,

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.115
you and I stay together.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:22.419
- Yeah, yeah, 100%, that's
what we want, right?

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.521
So, what do you wanna do?

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:30.027
- Then I'll go with option
two, we stay in the kids life,

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.595
we help raise it.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.398
I mean, just because
you're a real piece of work

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:37.701
doesn't mean the kid doesn't
deserve a dad, right?

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.536
- Sounds like a plan.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.039
I'll tell Sandy.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:43.007
- No you won't.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.308
- I won't?

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:45.642
- I'll tell her.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.477
- Of course.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:49.413
- Where is she?

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.281
- I haven't seen her.

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:54.184
- Okay, well don't
worry about it.

01:05:54.218 --> 01:05:57.521
You just run off and play with
your little friends, okay?

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:13.070
Sandra, may I have a
word with you, please?

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.638
- Yeah, okay, I don't think so.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.241
You're lucky she's
not in the hospital.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.642
- Well, she's about
to be in the hospital

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:23.080
having my husbands baby, so
I think I deserve a word.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.548
- Not now, they need to settle...

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:28.085
- You know, I'm as cool
as a cucumber, Karen.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:29.319
The way I see it, the
kid just doesn't deserve

01:06:29.353 --> 01:06:30.754
to grow up without a dad,

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:34.158
so I suggest that you and
I go somewhere privately,

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.426
and discuss the dynamics
of our new family.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.661
- All right.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:40.664
Yeah, Karen, I'm
willing to listen.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:41.665
- Will you excuse us?

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:43.500
You know, Karen can stay here,

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:46.370
I think you and I should go to
the bathroom, talk about it.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:47.237
- Okay.

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:48.271
- Okay.

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:53.777
- I have to get
over him anyways.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:56.513
- Are you really gonna be okay.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:23.307
- Look, all things considered,
I owe you an apology.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.243
I've been sleeping with
your husband and I'm sorry.

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:27.411
I know it was wrong.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.413
- Bro, what kind of
bullshit is that?

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:30.814
- What?

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:32.782
- Options, I thought you
were breaking up with her.

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.084
- What, I thought about
it and I decided I

01:07:34.118 --> 01:07:35.652
wanna stay alive.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:38.622
Besides, she's started looking
hotter over the last hour.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:39.756
- Yeah, that's the magic of
makeup and a tight dress.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:40.857
Come on?

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:41.825
- Something's gotta happen

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:42.792
and it's gotta happen soon.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.594
- Guys, it's all ready
been a night, all right?

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.830
And you're right,
Tammy looks great.

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:48.498
- Look, if you ever decide
to experiment on the straight

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.167
side, stay away from
my wife, all right?

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.501
She's bad news.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.470
- They're all bad news.

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:57.741
- Like I said, he
knows everything.

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:00.477
I don't remember
asking you to join us.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.179
- Hey, I don't remember
asking for all the shit

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:04.648
that happened neither,

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:08.518
because this is the one
night I come here to relax.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.720
- Well look man, none of
us wanted this to happen.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:13.823
- Well whatever
happened, it happened

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.693
because you messed up.

01:08:18.228 --> 01:08:20.296
- I oughta kick your ass.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:28.138
- Fernando, you lost your
job because you messed up.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:33.643
Are you gonna buy me a drink?

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.779
And you're gonna shut up.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.751
- Please give me a scotch.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:44.453
- Pay attention, Bill, that's
what a real man orders.

01:08:52.929 --> 01:08:56.233
- You don't know who's
who here, do you?

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.902
You don't even know
who you really are.

01:08:58.935 --> 01:08:59.868
- What the hell
you talking about?

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:01.505
These are my best friends.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:02.537
- Idiot.

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:11.548
You didn't figure out Tyler
here was gay until now.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:16.920
And Fernando, you keep
insisting that you just speak

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:21.425
with your best friends
wife privately.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.496
Privately.

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:34.904
And Billy, you're just facing
those little girls off in

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:37.541
there because you wanna
save your own ass.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.710
You wanna save your
own little sorry ass.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:43.447
- You're pretty quick to judge.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.613
- Hey Billy, there's
a lot of old sayings

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:47.817
written about guys
just like you.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.386
- What old saying?

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:53.323
- Such as hell have no
fury like a woman scorned.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.693
- Yeah, I've heard it, so?

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:00.564
- Yeah, what do you think
Tammy is doing with Sandra

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:08.472
in that room?

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:13.243
- Well, I'm not
entirely blameless,

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:16.813
I've been having an affair
with Fernando for months.

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:18.715
- Fernando, oh my God.

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:23.787
Okay, so that's why you
ran into the bathroom and...

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.689
- There's more.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.424
Bill and I've been trying
to get pregnant since we got

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:30.394
married and nothing's
worked until,

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:34.698
well, in a sick way hearing
Bill got you pregnant

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.566
was almost a relief.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.268
- Because you know
he's not sterile?

01:10:38.302 --> 01:10:42.306
- No, because I'm pregnant
with Fernando's baby.

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:48.712
- Oh my God, you're kidding?

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:54.651
Wow, I mean, I
guess it's perfect,

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.922
everyone gets what they wanted.

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:03.259
- I just never, never planned
for it to happen this way.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.029
- Well I mean, life
is what happens

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:07.431
when you're busy
making other plans.

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:10.667
I mean, that's what
they say, right?

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.871
- Yeah, it's just, it's
just a lot to take in, okay.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:16.806
- It's gonna be fine.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840
It will be fine.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.382
- Everything won't be fine.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:29.619
Why, we're both getting what
we wanted, it will be perfect?

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:31.388
- Do you remember what
I told you before,

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:33.557
last time we were in here?

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:38.895
I said if you touch me
again, I would kill you.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.929
You've been picturing
this perfect little life

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.365
where everything works out,

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.768
but you can't have it.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.352
- Bill, Bill, Bill!

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:41.825
Lay her down.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.695
- What you do, what happened?

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:49.966
- Bill, this isn't about you.

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:55.038
Fernando, I'm
carrying your child.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:07.651
Why did I have to
fall in love with you?

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.160
- Oh my God.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:26.670
Our friendship didn't mean shit!

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:28.705
- I can explain, bro.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:40.583
- Freeze!

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:44.721
- Calm down, Bill.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.055
- What's going on in here?

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.791
- Boys, back it off, relax!

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:49.626
- Hey, get off of me.

01:13:55.499 --> 01:13:56.933
- Hey, we'll take it from here.

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:58.935
Keep everything
locked down, officers.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:02.138
- Excuse me, who do
you think you are?

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.140
- You were my best man.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.809
- Someone need to
do some explaining,

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:06.943
what's going on in here?

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.513
- Stand down, officers,
we've got this.

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:10.647
- I need more than that, ma'am.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.149
- Federal agent,
we're good, thank you.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.551
Thank you for coming in.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.620
- You two want to
get fired, Officer.

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:17.987
- No, ma'am.

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:19.088
- Then I suggest you call
your god damn captain

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.858
and get on with doing my job.

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:25.261
- Gentlemen, I have
your proof right here.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.463
- Thank you, good work.

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:41.144
- Sit down, Fernando.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.283
Have you ever heard
of Shiam Simya?

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.519
- No, why should
I give a shit about them?

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:51.187
- It sounds like
Chinese or something.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.290
- It's actually Russian,
also known as MI7,

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:57.727
the biggest crime syndicate
in the former Soviet Union.

01:14:57.761 --> 01:14:59.262
- Were those the bastards
that killed Tammy?

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:03.099
- Not quite, why don't
you tell him, Fernando?

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:09.005
- I've got nothing to say.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.776
- It's all in there.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.018
- Your best buddy Fernando
here was paid to be

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:19.649
the eyes and ears of the Muerto,

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:22.952
MI7's biggest rival
in the heroin trade.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.955
- Geez, that's a lot of cash.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:27.757
- Yeah man, my idiot
dad decided he wanted

01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:28.925
to buy a house with cash.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:29.958
- Uh, okay.

01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:33.963
- You're all dead.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.765
- Everyone wanted to
keep an eye on you, Bill.

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:38.134
Tammy was an agent for MI7,

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:41.037
assigned to keep an eye
on you and Fernando.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.118
- Was that Russian?

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.821
- Hey, yeah, I'm taking a class.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.190
- I don't get it.

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:02.759
- It was all about Jacob, Bill,

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:04.193
everyone thought you were him.

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:07.030
- Jacob, no, they told me
he died four years ago.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:09.298
- He did, he took six
bullets to the chest

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:11.167
but not everyone was convinced.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:25.348
- He had a habit
of posing as you,

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:29.318
an average, government
employee, no threat to anyone.

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:31.955
- That doesn't make any
sense, why would he do that?

01:16:31.988 --> 01:16:34.323
- Because who knows what
kind of secrets people spill

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:37.360
when they think nobody knows
what they're talking about.

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:40.363
- In this case, the codes
for the information satellite

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:43.967
that MI7 uses for their
secure communication.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.736
- Yeah, your brother was
real close to cracking

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.772
those codes when he was killed.

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:50.707
Nobody knew how close he was,

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.341
and everybody wanted to know.

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:55.812
So convenient information
leak made the dealers think

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.181
that he was still alive
and posing as you.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.348
- We wanted to keep
an eye on them,

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:01.284
and knew they'd be drawn to you.

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:02.986
- Ah great, so you
used me as bait.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:06.756
- Sometimes sacrifices must
be made for the greater good.

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.658
- I know I shouldn't
have voted for Bush.

01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:10.293
- Actually, it was
Clinton who authorized

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:13.697
the company for
those types of calls.

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.730
- Bastards.

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:20.036
So, I don't get it, why
did Tammy kill Sandy?

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.738
- Sandy was with the Sicilians.

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.272
- The Sicilians were
also trying to get access

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.874
to that satellite.

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:32.314
- Sorry.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:44.093
- Oh, an Italian passport.

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:51.367
And they all thought
that I had these codes?

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.803
- Still not sure you don't.

01:17:53.837 --> 01:17:54.971
- Why didn't you just kill me?

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:58.041
- MI7 was afraid you had written
down the codes somewhere,

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:00.176
and everybody else
was afraid you hadn't.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.145
- So every relationship
that I've had for the past

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.447
four years has been a lie.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.049
I need a god damn drink.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:09.252
- Tyler was straight,
not literally,

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:11.921
but he wasn't an agent
and neither was Craig.

01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:14.057
You should just be happy
that you're alive, pal.

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.391
Tammy was actually supposed to

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:18.327
kill you and Fernando tonight.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:22.098
- It turns out she
really did love you guys.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.035
- So what about you three?

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:30.173
- Suzanne, Rafferty, and I,
we're assigned to protect you,

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:33.176
but we couldn't let you know.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.209
- Hey, hey!

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.346
- Off me, get off me!

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.882
- For gods sakes.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.350
Yeah, do it tight.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.388
- Okay, so what now?

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:49.425
- So now, your friend Fernando
goes away for a while,

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:51.227
a long while.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:54.798
And you go into
witness protection.

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:55.832
- You're still a target, Bill.

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:58.234
We can't risk letting you go.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:02.505
- I need a cigarette,
anybody have a smoke?

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:05.308
- There's no smoking in here.

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:08.177
- Well can I go out for
at least a minute, please?

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:12.849
- He's fine, I mean,
there's cops everywhere.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:13.882
- Here.

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:20.990
- Hey, Bill.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:23.425
I'm sorry.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:33.837
- All my friends
were not my friends

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:35.204
and I was just the job to them.

01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:44.413
But you are too.

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:46.182
Seriously, if you
need me for anything,

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:47.550
I got your back, okay?

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.290
Relax.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.501
It's finally over.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:25.982
- Well hell, this is
bigger than I thought.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.417
Isn't it?

01:21:33.156 --> 01:21:36.359
- Yeah, you were
right about one thing.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:41.264
Everybody has secrets.

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:51.574
My secret, I took my dead
twin brothers identity.

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:54.177
I had to, so I could survive.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:30.446
The Russian family, MI7,
wanted the codes very badly,

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:32.681
and would've stopped at nothing.

01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:35.518
