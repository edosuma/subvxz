>> THE LAUNCHER SHIFTED FUNNY.

27:03.321 --> 27:10.728
>> HAVING THE WORST TIME.
>> TWO PINS CONNECT THE
HYDRAULIC ARMS TO THE LAUNCHER.

27:10.862 --> 27:19.837
>> WHEN YOU SHAKE THE POT AFTER
AWHILE, IT GETS LOOSE.
>> Narrator: WITHOUT THEM, THE

27:19.971 --> 27:25.209
HYDRAULICS CAN'T POWER THE
LAUNCHER AND THE BOATS CAN'T
FISH.

27:25.343 --> 27:34.518
>> THEY JUMP RIGHT IN.
HE HAS THE TOOLS COMING OUT,
PROMPTED EVERYBODY TO GIVE HIM A

27:34.653 --> 27:42.326
HAND.

>> ALMOST DONE.

28:01.246 --> 28:08.686
>> OH.
COULDN'T COME AT A WORSE TIME.
>> HOPEFULLY THAT FIX WILL WORK

28:08.820 --> 28:14.825
FOR US.
>> HE IS COMING OUT.
THAT WILL BE GREAT IF WE'RE

28:14.960 --> 28:20.698
THERE.
>> HOW ARE WE LOOKING, GUYS?
>> HOPEFULLY IT WILL LAST

28:20.832 --> 28:37.348
ANOTHER FOUR HOURS.
>> GOOD TO GO?
ALL RIGHT.

28:37.482 --> 28:43.053
>> COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER.
WE'RE STILL WITHIN THE WINDOW, I
MEAN, IF WE CAN KEEP A SIMILAR

28:43.188 --> 28:50.327
PACE, GET OUT OF HERE, WEATHER
IS SUPPOSED TO BE BEARABLE, CAN

29:23.962 --> 29:28.198
HERE, THAT'S NO GROUND TO COVER
BETWEEN WHERE I STARTED AND
ENDED UP.

29:28.333 --> 29:34.705
I KEPT FOLLOWING THE CRAB.
I HAVE 100,000 POUNDS LEFT TO
CATCH.

29:34.839 --> 29:51.588
I WANT TO FILL THESE TANKS.
>> POT COMING UP.
>> SET THEM OUT, TRY TO STAY

29:51.723 --> 30:20.384
AHEAD OF THE CURVE WITH CRAB.
>> YEAH!
>> THAT'S A TANK FILLER.

30:20.518 --> 30:29.793

BAIRDI, THAT'S ABOVE THE AVERAGE
FOR OPILIO FISHING NOW BY 35

31:15.907 --> 31:23.714
CRAB.
NOT MOVING ANYWHERE.
OBVIOUSLY.

31:23.848 --> 31:42.366
I'M JUST GOING TO DESTROY THESE
CRABS.
I SMOKED IT.

31:42.500 --> 31:52.976
>> GUYS.
[BLEEP].
>> BLEW A HYDRAULIC LINE ON THE

31:53.111 --> 31:58.715
WENCH, RIGHT THERE.
>> I WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK ON WOOD,
BLEW OUT THE HYDRAULIC HOSE.

31:58.850 --> 32:04.855
I WAS JUST UP HERE TALKING ABOUT
HOW GOOD THE FISHING WAS.
RULE NUMBER ONE.

32:04.989 --> 32:12.129
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
SOMEBODY DOES HAVE A SENSE OF
HUMOR FOR SURE.

32:12.263 --> 32:25.776

GOOD, FIRST STRING OF THE DAY,
PICKING WENCH BLEW A LINE.

32:54.839 --> 33:09.153
IN AND FIXED.
>> LIKE A NASCAR TEAM.
>> MY SUPERSTITIOUS FISHERMAN

33:09.287 --> 33:13.590
WAYS, NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
FISHING GOOD AGAIN.
DIRECT CORRELATION, I DON'T CARE

33:13.725 --> 33:18.262
WHAT YOU SAY.
NEVER GOING TO JINX MYSELF
SAYING HOW GOOD THE TRIP IS

33:18.396 --> 33:26.870
GOING AGAIN.
EVERYBODY BETTER KNOCK ON WOOD
DOWN THERE.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.789
>> Narrator: HOT ON SIG'S TAIL,
JOSH HARRIS

33:43.654 --> 33:58.735

34:58.730 --> 35:05.903
KNOWN AS CRAB BALL.
>> THAT'S SOME EPIC [BLEEP].
>> HOPEFULLY THEY'RE NOT ALL

35:06.037 --> 35:17.281
TANGLED UP.
HOPEFULLY THERE'S A BUNCH OF
CRAB IN THEM.

35:17.415 --> 35:34.998
[BLEEP].
>> STARTING TO GET THICKER.
>> OH!

35:35.133 --> 35:49.212

480 IN THAT ONE.

37:13.631 --> 37:24.107
THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE EVEN
BIGGER.
>> THIS IS INSANE.

37:24.242 --> 37:30.680
>> ONE LITTLE PAD.
>> MY MONEY BALL.
MY MONEY BALL IS PAYING OFF.

37:30.815 --> 37:43.960
>> BIG POT.
WOO!
>> HE IS A YOUNG DUDE, YOUNG

37:44.095 --> 37:53.703
