WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:05.139
* Step down from your spaceship,
honey *

00:05.173 --> 00:09.043
* And put your feet
on the ground. *

00:09.077 --> 00:11.045
ALAN:
Non-Newtonian fluids, right?

00:11.079 --> 00:12.713
CHARLIE:
Right, non-Newtonian fluids.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.482
A fluid whose viscosity

00:14.515 --> 00:16.084
is variable based
upon applied stress.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.419
Yeah, see, Dad,
if you slap it...

00:18.452 --> 00:21.455
it acts like a solid,
but if you poke it...

00:21.489 --> 00:22.756
it's a liquid.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.426
This is, uh, in your
lesson plan, why?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.294
It's an interesting

00:26.327 --> 00:28.496
study in transitional
system analysis.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.531
Yeah, but I thought you teach
advanced number theory.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.534
Well, the Riemann
zeta function, um...

00:33.567 --> 00:35.069
What?

00:35.103 --> 00:36.437
Students will get a kick
out of it.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.805
And by the students,
you mean the teachers.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.074
All right, you know what?
I think we're good, huh?

00:40.108 --> 00:40.941
Hey,

00:40.974 --> 00:42.776
looking good,
Professor Fleinhardt.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.745
And I'm feeling good,
Professor Eppes.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.117
Oh. Oh!

00:49.150 --> 00:51.119
Uh, coffee, Alan?

00:51.152 --> 00:51.819
Absolutely.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.488
Oh, my.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.191
More starch.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.232
(indistinct conversation)

01:06.200 --> 01:07.601
Thank you so much
for coming.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.840
All seven seals

01:12.873 --> 01:14.175
of the Apocalypse
were shattered

01:14.208 --> 01:16.810
when Germany invaded Poland
in 1939.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.280
Hitler delivered Lucifer
into the world.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.814
It's documented.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.550
I'm looking for my mother.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.186
"They were given authority

01:25.219 --> 01:27.188
over a quarter of the Earth."

01:27.221 --> 01:30.124
World War II Europe--
that's a quarter of the Earth.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.659
Did you want
some coffee?

01:31.692 --> 01:33.194
I'd love some.
-Okay.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.863
"To kill with sword,
famine, plague,

01:35.896 --> 01:38.232
and by means of beasts
of the Earth."

01:38.266 --> 01:43.204
What beast of the Earth kills
more than man himself?

01:43.237 --> 01:45.839
CRAIG:
Thank you, Audrey.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.775
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.911
Here it comes.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.880
Excuse me for a minute.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.748
Reverend...

01:54.782 --> 01:55.916
Walter...

01:55.949 --> 01:58.152
Walter?!

01:58.186 --> 01:59.220
Grandpa, are you okay?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.821
(screaming with pain)

02:00.854 --> 02:03.624
Oh, my God, no!
Somebody help me!

02:03.657 --> 02:05.459
(groaning)
Oh, no!

02:05.493 --> 02:06.794
Craig?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.696
(groaning)
Craig, what's wrong?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.864
Craig...?

02:10.898 --> 02:11.932
Craig?

02:11.965 --> 02:12.933
Can somebody help us?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.469
Craig...
(groaning)

02:15.503 --> 02:16.670
Craig?

02:16.704 --> 02:18.939
(panicked murmuring)

02:18.972 --> 02:21.175
(parishioners clamoring)

02:21.209 --> 02:22.843
What's wrong?

02:22.876 --> 02:24.912
Oh, Lord, please don't...

02:24.945 --> 02:27.248
Play it in back your stance,
right?

02:27.281 --> 02:29.583
Choke up and just punch it,
all right?

02:29.617 --> 02:31.585
It's not a big follow through.
-Just punch it.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.620
Punch it.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.654
Okay.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.223
Choke and punch.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.259
(chuckling):
Choke and punch it.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.194
Are you enjoying this
at all?

02:40.228 --> 02:42.196
Somewhat, I hope.
-Yeah.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.198
Beautiful weather,
sexy instructor--

02:44.232 --> 02:45.633
what's not to like?

02:45.666 --> 02:48.336
"Got a tight spot here.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.937
Tight spot."
-I'll say.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.440
(laughing)

02:52.473 --> 02:53.741
It's from O Brother,
Where Art Thou?

02:53.774 --> 02:57.478
Uh, actually, it's from
Sullivan's Travels, originally.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.846
Maybe the best movie
ever made.

02:58.879 --> 02:59.947
Huh.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.882
I would've thought
you would've been into Heat,

03:01.915 --> 03:03.284
or something like that.
-"What are you

03:03.317 --> 03:04.418
giving me the high hat,
girlie?"

03:04.452 --> 03:08.289
(phone ringing)

03:08.322 --> 03:10.958
United States Attorney's Office
doesn't take the weekend off.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.993
Brooks.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.496
(phone ringing)

03:15.529 --> 03:17.798
(parishioners clamoring)

03:19.767 --> 03:22.236
DON:
What is this?

03:22.270 --> 03:23.271
ROBIN:
Patmos Church--

03:23.304 --> 03:24.872
government classifies them
as a dangerous cult.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.840
They're not allowed
to receive medical attention,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.576
or see a doctor--
only God can heal.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.378
Paramedics got
a 911 call

03:30.411 --> 03:32.746
from inside, looks like some
kind of mass poisoning.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.315
So what are you doing out here?

03:34.348 --> 03:35.949
You will not violate
our religious freedom!

03:35.983 --> 03:39.720
The First Amendment
forbids your trespass.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.854
SUSAN DORAN: Faith will heal
the righteous!

03:40.888 --> 03:42.590
Normally we'd
break the gate,

03:42.623 --> 03:44.892
but LAPD's already got three
lawsuits pending

03:44.925 --> 03:47.261
from these wackos, and we're
under a consent decree.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.029
ROBIN: Okay, well, this
is some very gray

03:49.062 --> 03:50.698
First Amendment real estate.
-We believe

03:50.731 --> 03:52.900
in the power of the Lord,
not your wicked elixirs.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.435
ROBIN:
Who called it in?

03:54.468 --> 03:55.769
OFFICER:
Anonymous.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.271
But we're sure it came
from an inside line.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.606
Okay, well, if someone
in there wants help,

03:58.639 --> 03:59.773
we might have grounds.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.808
No.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.975
Stop! Stop!

04:02.009 --> 04:03.511
You can't do this!

04:03.544 --> 04:05.313
The First Amendment
forbids it.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.614
You can't do it!

04:06.647 --> 04:07.848
Read the First Amendment.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.283
We have rights!
-Come on, come on.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.884
Let's go.
All right, back up.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.654
It's okay, let them through.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.788
REVEREND EZRA: God loves us;
this is just a message

04:14.822 --> 04:16.056
from him.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.891
We're here to help you.
Let's go. Move back.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.527
Let's go!
Move back!

04:19.560 --> 04:21.329
Back up, everybody.
Give us some room here.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.863
"Nor did they repent

04:22.896 --> 04:24.798
their murders and
their magic potions."

04:24.832 --> 04:25.899
Lady...

04:25.933 --> 04:28.769
You don't even know who you are.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.438
You need to leave.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.840
(panicked shouting)

04:32.873 --> 04:34.007
I just want to help you.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.042
(clamoring)

04:35.075 --> 04:36.744
Over here, please!

04:36.777 --> 04:37.745
OFFICER:
Calm down!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.046
No!
We're here...

04:39.079 --> 04:40.314
WOMAN:
We don't want your help.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.682
Thank you.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.551
Sure.
-Please stay back.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.719
The paramedics are here.
-I know.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.054
Stop right now!

04:47.087 --> 04:48.722
Is he going to be okay?

04:56.997 --> 05:00.701
MEGAN: Patmos Church was
founded in 1978,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.603
hit the NRM list in '93.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.405
NRM?

05:04.438 --> 05:05.439
"New Religious
Movement."

05:05.473 --> 05:06.507
They believe
the Apocalypse

05:06.540 --> 05:07.775
has been going on for 70 years--

05:07.808 --> 05:09.377
started with World War II--

05:09.410 --> 05:11.845
and that the Book
of Revelation proves

05:11.879 --> 05:13.681
that Hitler

05:13.714 --> 05:14.782
released Lucifer,

05:14.815 --> 05:16.617
and he is
here on Earth

05:16.650 --> 05:18.752
specifically
targeting them.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.687
I thought cults believe

05:19.720 --> 05:21.422
they were the first
to get into Heaven.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.690
Why are they still here?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.992
We could call it a literal take
on the Bible--

05:25.025 --> 05:27.395
that only the
Chosen People,

05:27.428 --> 05:31.865
144,000 Jews, were
raptured out in 1939.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.434
Patmos believes
they're going

05:33.467 --> 05:34.868
to have to stay
here on Earth

05:34.902 --> 05:36.937
and fight with Lucifer for
their place in Heaven.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.772
All right,
so how does this all relate

05:38.806 --> 05:40.641
to refusing medical help?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.909
I'm not really sure
that it does.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.144
I mean, they've created
their own

05:44.177 --> 05:46.680
little strange patchwork
quilt of ideas.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.849
Techs confirmed
the poison was arsenic--

05:48.882 --> 05:50.518
delivered through the coffee.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.453
You have two dead,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.455
three in a coma,
and another 16 victims.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.689
The ground water tested

05:55.723 --> 05:58.826
normal, and there's no residual
poison in the construction.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.627
COLBY:
Jim Jones.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.762
Instead of cyanide
in the Kool-Aid,

06:01.795 --> 06:03.163
it's arsenic in the java.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.533
Reverend Ezra makes the coffee
in the church kitchen,

06:05.566 --> 06:07.034
but he also leaves it
unattended.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.736
So anybody has access to it.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.439
Any chance we can track
the poison?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.573
Arsenic is a common pesticide,

06:12.606 --> 06:14.442
and this area has
been an agricultural

06:14.475 --> 06:15.709
for the past
hundred years, so

06:15.743 --> 06:17.010
I think it could have
come from anywhere.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.880
You know, this could really
be a hate crime.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.550
Angry neighbors, ex-member
with a grudge,

06:22.583 --> 06:23.951
maybe disgruntled parents.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.487
DAVID: Well, the church compound
is heavily fortified,

06:26.520 --> 06:29.056
and they have locked gates,
barbed wire fences,

06:29.089 --> 06:30.991
and they have security cameras
all over the place.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.827
The up side
of being paranoid nut jobs.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.596
Yeah.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.765
Sunday was my day off.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.068
I would say it's an inside job,

06:41.101 --> 06:42.903
'cause they have a
pretty extensive

06:42.936 --> 06:44.171
security system.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.540
Uh, and how many members
in this cult?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.542
Well, a thousand,
at least.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.544
(knocking on door)

06:50.578 --> 06:53.046
I embrace in situ
experimentation

06:53.080 --> 06:54.582
as much as any
physicist,

06:54.615 --> 06:57.518
but next time you make
the aqueous odyssey.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.552
Well, it'll work next time.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.620
A scientist
is never

06:59.653 --> 07:01.622
as diligent as when he himself

07:01.655 --> 07:03.591
is the experimental subject.
-Hey, I was diligent!

07:03.624 --> 07:05.058
Right now,
I'm calculating possible

07:05.092 --> 07:06.226
concentration-temperature
coefficients...

07:06.259 --> 07:07.495
All right...

07:07.528 --> 07:08.729
Charlie, come on,
please, focus?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.030
Certainly.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.131
On what?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.666
There was
a mass murder attempt

07:12.700 --> 07:14.635
at a cult church
this morning.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.769
Attempt?

07:15.803 --> 07:16.870
DON:
Yeah, arsenic.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.639
Although, fortunately,
since 9/11,

07:18.672 --> 07:20.708
we've been stockpiling
the antidote.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.909
Dimercaprol.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.143
We saved most of them,
although, actually,

07:23.176 --> 07:24.144
they tried to stop us.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.112
Faith healers?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.548
And I was
telling him

07:27.581 --> 07:28.716
unless we have a thousand
psychopaths,

07:28.749 --> 07:29.683
the poisoner's motives

07:29.717 --> 07:31.885
and/or actions should
be easily detectable

07:31.919 --> 07:33.687
according to normal
social dynamics,

07:33.721 --> 07:35.656
whatever those are.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.629
Social network analysis--

07:41.662 --> 07:42.696
Bayesian network analysis--

07:42.730 --> 07:44.665
will help me uncover
hidden dynamics

07:44.698 --> 07:45.799
and covert architecture

07:45.833 --> 07:47.267
of this cult.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.235
Well, I wouldn't
so readily

07:48.268 --> 07:51.271
discount the
"thousand psychopaths" theory.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.708
I mean, what kind of
mindless cretins...

07:54.742 --> 07:55.776
"Creh-tins"?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.979
...would blind themselves
to the gifts of science?

07:59.012 --> 08:02.883
How else would a Creator
reveal himself but through

08:02.916 --> 08:06.019
his creation? And to deny
the mind of that creation

08:06.053 --> 08:08.989
is to deny the mind of God!

08:11.825 --> 08:15.763
Isn't it "cree-tins"?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.765
Did you know that Don's
favorite movie

08:17.798 --> 08:19.767
is a Preston Sturges
comedy?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.769
It's not Heat?
-I know, right?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.236
CRAIG:
What do you call this?!

08:23.270 --> 08:25.739
REVEREND EZRA: You're the one
who crossed the line.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.742
Be angry with me for
getting medical help,

08:28.776 --> 08:30.243
but don't shirk responsibility

08:30.277 --> 08:32.546
for your sexual misconduct.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.982
I'm 18! I'm an adult!
I can do what I want!

08:35.015 --> 08:37.284
Hey, guys, keep it
in your own corners.

08:42.756 --> 08:46.226
He thinks he can just control
me like he always has.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.728
Things are going
to change.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.062
What kind of things?

08:49.096 --> 08:50.698
I spent the night
with my girlfriend.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.165
I love Audrey and I'm done.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.268
I'm done sneaking around.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.641
I know how the government
regards us, Agent Granger,

09:00.674 --> 09:02.710
but we are a church,
not a cult.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.578
This was a hate crime.

09:04.612 --> 09:05.913
We were attacked
because of our faith.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.247
The kind of faith
where everyone

09:07.280 --> 09:09.917
turns over power of attorney
to their leader?

09:09.950 --> 09:12.620
We live in Lucifer's time,

09:12.653 --> 09:15.589
forced to contend with schemes
that he disguises as laws.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.791
My flock looks to
me for guidance.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.127
Well, they weren't so happy
with your decision

09:20.160 --> 09:22.029
to let the paramedics
save their lives.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.798
Sadly, there is a tradition at
Patmos of misinterpreting

09:24.832 --> 09:26.900
scripture on faith-
based healing.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.335
Now, I've been working with the
Council of Elders

09:28.368 --> 09:29.269
to change that.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.839
Well, we're going to
need to take a look

09:31.872 --> 09:33.173
at some church files--
records, history.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.709
Sister Susan Doran will give
you everything you need.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.678
I'll instruct her
to be cooperative.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.348
Boy, that's the fourth
security camera we've passed

09:41.381 --> 09:43.016
since they buzzed us
through the gate.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.018
Extremist in Orwellian
paranoia

09:45.052 --> 09:47.054
as well as stunted
religious beliefs.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.388
Hey, so,
did you see anything

09:48.421 --> 09:49.857
on that surveillance footage?

09:49.890 --> 09:50.824
No outsiders got in,

09:50.858 --> 09:53.360
and the coffee urns were
placed strategically

09:53.393 --> 09:55.195
nowhere near all
those cameras,

09:55.228 --> 09:57.197
so the enemy lies within.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.366
Well, isn't it always so?
-Hmm.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.102
Huh, what do you think
these people are so afraid of?

10:02.135 --> 10:04.104
Anybody not them.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.774
They feel privy
to sacred information

10:06.807 --> 10:08.008
that they're morally

10:08.041 --> 10:09.877
obligated to defend.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.279
MEGAN: And Ideologues
tend to demonize

10:12.312 --> 10:13.914
anyone who opposes them.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.883
Mrs. Doran,

10:15.916 --> 10:17.751
I'm Special
Agent Reeves.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.720
These are Doctors
Fleinhardt and Eppes.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.255
We're here to go through
your church records.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.658
Yeah, we're just here
to help.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.827
You've already put our souls
in jeopardy.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.962
How are our people supposed
to meet the Father

10:28.996 --> 10:31.932
with your noxious medicine
flowing through their veins?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.934
Without
said "noxious medicines,"

10:33.967 --> 10:37.170
you would have dozens now dead
instead of just the two.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.172
Or has your zealotry
blinded you to that?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.307
Larry...

10:40.340 --> 10:41.842
Hitler adopted
the cult of science.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.676
Do you align with him?

10:42.710 --> 10:44.077
LARRY: Oh, those are
my choices here?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.079
Hitler's science
or your religion?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.314
Oh, my God in Heaven.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.949
Do not take
His name in vain!

10:48.982 --> 10:50.784
What is vain is
my appeal to Him

10:50.818 --> 10:53.453
to grace you with some small
glimmer of rational thought.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.689
Hey, that's enough.
-Maybe you should take a walk.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.158
Yes, exactly.
So...

10:58.191 --> 10:59.893
MEGAN: Mrs. Doran, we respect
your religious freedom--

10:59.927 --> 11:00.894
you can believe anything

11:00.928 --> 11:03.196
that you like--
we're just here to go through

11:03.230 --> 11:04.431
the church records, that's all.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.967
We're neutral, you know?
Just scientists.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.968
You're bricklayers,

11:08.001 --> 11:11.071
paving the path to hell
with good intentions.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.275
Coming?

11:15.308 --> 11:16.777
I'll be right back.

11:19.012 --> 11:19.612
Hey.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.814
Audrey will help you find

11:20.848 --> 11:21.915
the files you need.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.150
Thanks, Audrey.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.886
Hi.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.455
MEGAN: Wow, that's an awful
lot of cash.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.824
Safer here
than under the eyes

11:30.858 --> 11:32.359
and hands
of Lucifer's moneylenders.

11:34.862 --> 11:39.432
My father, Reverend
Richard Doran, founded Patmos.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.068
We've been custodians
of the church's finances

11:41.101 --> 11:42.836
and records
since the early days.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.938
It's only a matter
of time

11:44.972 --> 11:46.840
before Reverend Ezra
and his deceitful son

11:46.874 --> 11:49.509
put an end to that
tradition, as well.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.479
Mother... Craig is
a good person.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.948
You never lied to me
until you met him.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.888
My father passed away
last summer.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.156
The church
is in a period of transition.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.859
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:05.893 --> 12:06.860
How did your father die?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.029
Heart attack.

12:09.062 --> 12:09.863
And then

12:09.897 --> 12:11.899
Reverend Ezra took over
the church?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.333
Yes.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.870
But he and Craig joined us
almost three years ago.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.439
Heart attack...

12:19.472 --> 12:23.310
Arsenic poisoning can sometimes
be misread as heart failure.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.878
We're going to
want to exhume

12:24.912 --> 12:26.814
your husband's body.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.982
Absolutely not.

12:29.016 --> 12:32.185
His body, in life or in death,
is sacred.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.332
Ezra agreed to the
exhumation on the condition

12:45.365 --> 12:47.134
that he be present

12:47.167 --> 12:49.903
to protect the sanctity
of Richard Doran's body.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.539
Hmm. Let's see
what we turn up.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.412
Everyone present?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.491
All done with the cutting.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.593
I don't understand.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.761
We all have normal levels

13:14.794 --> 13:17.497
of heavy metal like arsenic
or mercury in our bodies.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.934
Hair shows abnormal dosages.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.970
Even a year later?
-Well, they dug up Napoleon,

13:23.003 --> 13:24.171
and it worked on him,
so yeah,

13:24.204 --> 13:25.906
I think we still
got a window here.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.810
Atomic absorption
spectrometry.

13:34.982 --> 13:40.220
This bad boy zaps it all the way
from a liquid into free atoms,

13:40.253 --> 13:43.290
measuring the concentration
of the arsenic.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.958
Now, a normal person's hair
would read

13:44.992 --> 13:47.060
10 to 20 PPB--
parts per billion.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.261
And what about
a murder victim?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.164
Above 10,000
will be fatal.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.476
(door opens)

14:03.510 --> 14:04.878
You did this.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.279
REVEREND EZRA:
Susan, we need to know

14:06.313 --> 14:07.414
whether or not Richard...

14:07.447 --> 14:08.648
We don't need
anything from them.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.017
You're desecrating
my husband,

14:10.050 --> 14:12.319
just like you
destroyed my church.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.620
DAVID:
Mrs. Doran, please.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.990
(rapid clicking)

14:17.024 --> 14:19.126
(three short beeps)

14:19.159 --> 14:21.128
What does that mean?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.964
That your husband was murdered.

14:32.973 --> 14:36.176
COLBY: Reverend Doran gets
poisoned, and you get Patmos.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.412
REVEREND EZRA: I was in Alaska
on a mission before he died.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.681
Returned home to perform
his service, in fact.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.584
And jumped
Susan Doran's place in line.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.220
She wants to stand still
30 years in the past,

14:47.254 --> 14:50.357
when Patmos consisted
of 11 people in tents

14:50.390 --> 14:52.092
in an orange grove.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.961
So everyone just follows a guy
who's been around

14:53.994 --> 14:56.997
less than three years?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.598
The council
is painfully aware

14:58.631 --> 15:02.102
of the prejudices against us--
prejudices that begin

15:02.135 --> 15:05.939
with the government
classifying us as a cult.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.308
They believe
that I can move us forward,

15:08.341 --> 15:11.244
see that our traditions
are recognized and respected.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.281
Your tradition against
the Devil.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.951
Don't you fight against him
every day?

15:17.985 --> 15:20.320
Isn't that why this room exists?

15:23.390 --> 15:26.126
CHARLIE: All right, top-level
priorities-- Reverend Ezra.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.360
This is the percentage
for info in.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.197
Oh, I thought
that was info out.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.299
No, I've got information
moving out from Reverend Ezra.

15:32.332 --> 15:36.236
Okay, so I need to rework
my equation for info out.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.337
I hate to break this up,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.506
but I was about to pass out
from the marker fumes.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.042
Ah, yes,
that would be the lemon.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.410
I told you
it was too much.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.411
I like it.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.113
It smells like a urinal cake.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.214
Statement from Reverend Ezra.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.348
Thanks.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.317
Looks like there was infighting
for control of the cult.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.020
Okay, that's excellent,
because it's that kind

15:53.053 --> 15:53.820
of concealed dynamic

15:53.853 --> 15:55.422
that will help
uncover the motive

15:55.455 --> 15:58.125
for poisoning the entire church.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.659
Uh, in social
network analysis,

15:59.692 --> 16:01.094
we examine the
differences

16:01.128 --> 16:03.330
between the perception
of a group's structure

16:03.363 --> 16:07.034
and its actual structure--
the hidden architecture.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.235
In an apartment building,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.470
hidden behind the walls,
under the floors,

16:10.503 --> 16:12.139
are complex systems--

16:12.172 --> 16:14.707
plumbing, electricity,
phone lines.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.709
While we may endow
the penthouse

16:16.743 --> 16:19.312
as being the most powerful
location in the building,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.581
the nerve center
is actually in the basement.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.283
So, using three variables--

16:23.316 --> 16:25.652
connectivity, access
and information--

16:25.685 --> 16:28.321
we can map the way
in which Patmos functions.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.589
And who's being left
in the dark.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.360
Susan Doran... isn't this the
woman that you threw down with?

16:33.393 --> 16:37.397
I... didn't say
"threw down."

16:37.430 --> 16:39.466
You know, I was taken aback

16:39.499 --> 16:42.069
by the intensity
of her intolerance, yes.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.270
Aren't you the one
that told me

16:43.303 --> 16:45.472
never to try to teach anybody
who doesn't want to learn?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.673
My dad used to say,

16:46.706 --> 16:49.276
"Don't talk religion unless
you're looking for a fight."

16:49.309 --> 16:50.410
(stammers, gasps)

16:50.443 --> 16:52.312
(drops marker)

16:54.781 --> 16:57.016
Your dad makes a good point.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.323
ROBIN:
I found something interesting.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.324
Yeah, what's that?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.793
In Patmos' latest appeal
for legal recognition,

17:06.826 --> 17:08.395
Reverend Ezra added a list

17:08.428 --> 17:10.463
of nine practices
that he's changing,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.299
including no more
prohibitions

17:12.332 --> 17:13.333
against people seeking
medical help.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.467
So what?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.469
I mean, you think
he's going legit?

17:16.503 --> 17:19.239
And trying
to make a ton of dough.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.607
In property taxes alone,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.375
they're paying
over six figures.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.145
Members pay 75% of their
income to the church,

17:25.178 --> 17:27.147
and Ezra controls
all of it.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.349
If they go legit
and get tax-exempt status,

17:29.382 --> 17:30.783
he gets millions more
to play with.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.784
Goes to motive.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.386
Right, but he
was in Alaska

17:33.420 --> 17:36.223
for the other
reverend's murder.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.091
Yeah, but he's still good
for the recent attacks.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.025
Dose the congregation,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.461
show them modern medicine
ain't so bad.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.297
So, what, maybe, like, two
of them did the poisoning?

17:44.331 --> 17:46.433
I know it doesn't seem likely,

17:46.466 --> 17:50.370
but I don't have a lot to go on
in this "cockeyed caravan."

17:50.403 --> 17:53.573
Wow, Preston Sturges,
Sullivan's Travels.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.742
I did my Don Eppes homework.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.211
Opposition research, my friend--
you should try it.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.246
All right.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.781
DON: Hey.
-Hey.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.417
So we've been studying the
hidden dynamics of your cult.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.320
Not a cult much longer,
if Ezra can help it.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.256
You know, that fits the pattern.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.423
You see, overtly,

18:10.457 --> 18:12.192
Reverend Ezra
is the leader

18:12.225 --> 18:14.261
with a council and
members below him.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.364
Yeah, we mapped out
more covert social networks--

18:17.397 --> 18:19.699
power relationships,
financial status, marriages.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.303
In the past, Susan Doran
was the connecting node--

18:23.336 --> 18:24.571
the gatekeeper,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.306
controlling the
flow of information

18:26.339 --> 18:27.907
amongst all the
subnetworks.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.810
Right, she had the safe
with all the records.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.245
Yeah, she's been the hidden
power behind Patmos

18:32.279 --> 18:33.280
for 30 years.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.581
CHARLIE:
However, we've noticed

18:34.614 --> 18:36.516
that she's had less
and less influence

18:36.549 --> 18:37.750
over the past
few years,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.552
since her husband
and Reverend Ezra

18:39.586 --> 18:41.688
began going on
missions together.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.390
Ezra usurped her position.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.225
Yeah, left her disconnected.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.694
What, are you saying
she killed him for power?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.596
Yeah, but it doesn't work, so
she loses status even faster.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.299
Now she's got to reveal Ezra
as an impostor

18:52.332 --> 18:54.667
by creating a situation
where he goes against church law

18:54.701 --> 18:56.603
and has to use medicine
to save his son.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.407
That's right-- so if she
mixed this poison at home,

19:00.440 --> 19:02.275
you're going to find
trace amounts of arsenic.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.948
ALAN:
You know what the best part

19:08.981 --> 19:10.450
about being
a student is?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.552
If I don't pass
a reflective surface,

19:12.585 --> 19:14.221
I'm convinced
that I'm 25 years old,

19:14.254 --> 19:16.689
and I'm, uh, about
to conquer the world.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.925
Well, I surrendered all
my dreams of conquest

19:18.958 --> 19:21.428
when I realized all I'd
have to show for it is...

19:21.461 --> 19:23.396
the world.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.665
Hey, hey, Larry,
what's eating you?

19:25.698 --> 19:28.535
A particularly repugnant woman
who somehow manages

19:28.568 --> 19:31.504
to link all science
with Hitler and the Devil.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.206
Oh, come on, Larry.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.308
It's not worth getting upset
about every crazy out there.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.142
Yeah, I know this!

19:36.175 --> 19:39.212
I live in a monastery,
I meditate.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.881
I-I believe in peace
and, and compassion

19:41.914 --> 19:43.716
and tolerance,
but still,

19:43.750 --> 19:47.254
this woman, she triggered
such outrage in me.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.388
I think that
people like that,

19:48.421 --> 19:50.723
like this woman, they're just
looking for something--

19:50.757 --> 19:52.225
they're looking for answers,

19:52.259 --> 19:54.294
you know, maybe even
some of the answers

19:54.327 --> 19:57.464
that you are, but just by, uh,
different means.

19:57.497 --> 20:01.434
You cannot begin to justify this
woman's spewing of her venom.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.435
N-N-N-No,

20:02.469 --> 20:03.536
I'm not, I'm not.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.306
It's just that, um,
not everyone has the emotional

20:06.339 --> 20:07.940
and intellectual resource
to search

20:07.974 --> 20:09.576
for God in a
supercollider.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.577
People look for answers

20:10.610 --> 20:12.379
in what's available to them,

20:12.412 --> 20:15.248
and when they're
particularly desperate,

20:15.282 --> 20:18.751
they latch on to the closest
answer that's available.

20:18.785 --> 20:23.256
I mean, it may make them wrong
but not necessarily evil.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.527
Yeah.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.463
Listen, I know you're right.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.433
All my life I have attempted

20:33.466 --> 20:38.305
to find just that perfect point
of beauty and balance

20:38.338 --> 20:41.841
between science
and spirituality,

20:41.874 --> 20:44.977
where they
not only coexist,

20:45.011 --> 20:46.879
they complete each other.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.615
And I saw in this woman's...

20:48.648 --> 20:53.586
rage and her ignorance
a complete caricature

20:53.620 --> 20:58.291
of my faith, and yes,

20:58.325 --> 21:02.729
I did match her bigotry
with my own.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.735
God will rain His
justice on your heads.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.903
I can live with that,
Mrs. Doran.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.774
You're a faithless
charlatan!

21:16.809 --> 21:18.778
You've spit on everything
we sacrificed our lives for!

21:20.647 --> 21:22.349
You can't hide
in the church!

21:22.382 --> 21:24.083
He will find you there!
-We're positive for arsenic

21:24.116 --> 21:25.084
residue in the
laundry room.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.387
How conclusive is this?
-Heavy concentrations.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.556
We're going to find it
all through the house.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.758
Why would anyone want
to harm us?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.493
It's indicative
of someone mixing water

21:33.526 --> 21:35.061
and arsenic in a container,

21:35.094 --> 21:36.729
not someone trying
to kill you.

21:36.763 --> 21:40.567
Are... are you accusing me?

21:40.600 --> 21:44.537
Actually, Mrs. Doran,
I am arresting you.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.606
Please...

21:46.639 --> 21:48.508
This is Your test.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.477
I can see that now.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.544
Let me be strong enough...

22:01.921 --> 22:03.523
(screaming):
Hurry! Audrey!

22:03.556 --> 22:06.426
Hold on, I'm going to get you
out of there-- back up!

22:08.495 --> 22:11.398
(coughing)

22:11.431 --> 22:14.367
Craig, give me your hand.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.968
You okay?
(Audrey coughing)

22:16.002 --> 22:17.670
Can you walk?

22:17.704 --> 22:20.072
(panting)
(coughing)

22:22.542 --> 22:24.844
(grunting)

22:28.515 --> 22:31.083
(coughing)

22:31.117 --> 22:33.152
Father--
in the kitchen.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.655
(coughing)

22:35.688 --> 22:37.123
(fire crackling)

22:39.592 --> 22:41.127
(coughing)

22:41.160 --> 22:42.562
Reverend Ezra!

22:42.595 --> 22:43.530
(coughing)

22:43.563 --> 22:45.398
(David straining)

22:45.432 --> 22:46.766
(coughing):
Reverend!

22:46.799 --> 22:48.601
(coughing)

22:48.635 --> 22:51.471
Reverend Ezra!

22:57.910 --> 22:58.945
Audrey.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.117
(coughing)

23:11.223 --> 23:13.693
My father?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.495
Craig, we weren't able
to get to your father.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.904
Hey, so, anyone else?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.038
Just Reverend Ezra.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.575
Craig Ezra, Audrey Doran,
they were shaken up a bit,

23:28.608 --> 23:29.809
but they're going
to be just fine.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.043
And you guys
are all right?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.178
Yeah. I was going
to wait

23:32.211 --> 23:33.245
for the fire department
to get here,

23:33.279 --> 23:35.615
but Granger made me look bad
by running in there.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.816
Ah, heroes.
-Right, the reluctant hero.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.952
Hey, at least you got
to carry a girl.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.488
So any idea
what caused it?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.689
No, we don't know yet,

23:42.722 --> 23:44.591
but the kitchen's hot
for arsenic dust.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.858
It was clear yesterday.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.126
Susan Doran?

23:47.159 --> 23:48.695
DAVID: She was cuffed
and in our custody.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.096
But she could've
set a trap.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.764
Well, maybe a kid.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.200
Craig says he and Audrey
were here to meet with his dad.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.234
Their alibi for the coffee
poisoning is weak.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.203
I mean, the hotel has them
checking in and out,

23:57.236 --> 23:58.505
but it doesn't mean
they were there.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.572
DAVID:
So what do you think?

23:59.606 --> 24:02.642
Kill Dad, put Mom in jail,
then they get married,

24:02.675 --> 24:04.544
take over the church,

24:04.577 --> 24:06.245
but that'd mean he
drank his own poison

24:06.278 --> 24:07.947
and he sat on
his own bomb.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.016
Right, so it makes him stupid
or a hardcore.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.555
LARRY (over radio): You know,
it's really your dad's insight

24:15.588 --> 24:17.824
that led to the epiphany

24:17.857 --> 24:20.527
re: my egregious behavior.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.661
Goggles.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.633
LARRY:
Okay.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.635
Version 17...

24:28.668 --> 24:30.136
(motor running)

24:31.671 --> 24:33.540
No reaction.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.274
Let's try intentional ignition.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.910
All right, where was I,
by the way?

24:37.944 --> 24:40.580
Uh, "epiphany"
and, uh...

24:40.613 --> 24:41.948
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
-"egregious behavior."

24:41.981 --> 24:43.950
There I was, I mean,
so self-righteously

24:43.983 --> 24:48.220
attacking Susan Doran
but never realizing

24:48.254 --> 24:51.057
that I was just projecting
my doubts onto her.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.659
Doubts about, uh...
about what?

24:52.692 --> 24:54.126
Well, about my
faith, you know.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.128
I have to wonder, all these
questions I'm asking--

24:56.162 --> 24:58.798
are they an expression
of my belief,

24:58.831 --> 25:03.603
or are they just a failure
to surrender myself to it?

25:03.636 --> 25:05.304
Larry, does it have to be
an "either-or"?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.607
Hey, there's one
to grapple with.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.576
LARRY: You know, the monks say
there are no enemies,

25:09.609 --> 25:12.579
just the unresolved within us.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.613
Hey.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.148
Hey, so... so we think heat

25:16.182 --> 25:18.551
accelerated arsenic dust
to create this fire.

25:18.585 --> 25:19.952
There was a similar
dust explosion

25:19.986 --> 25:21.954
at a sugar factory in Georgia.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.723
Wasn't that an accident?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.625
LARRY: Set off by sparking
heavy machinery.

25:25.658 --> 25:29.095
Yeah. We've been
attempting to recreate

25:29.128 --> 25:31.631
the accidental combustion
all morning,

25:31.664 --> 25:33.332
using kitchen appliances,

25:33.365 --> 25:34.634
but nothing's
exploded yet.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.768
Yeah, but that won't explain

25:35.802 --> 25:37.904
what the arsenic was doing
there in the first place.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.639
Which is why our next test

25:39.672 --> 25:43.142
will be to determine if the
explosion occurred by design.

25:46.646 --> 25:47.814
(switch clicks)

25:47.847 --> 25:49.582
Oh!

25:51.250 --> 25:54.253
Whew! Uh, confidence is high
this wasn't an accident.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.823
What does that do
to your network analysis?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.925
Well, network analysis
was an analytic sledgehammer.

25:58.958 --> 26:02.595
With the additional murder,
we've graduated to a scalpel--

26:02.629 --> 26:03.663
affinity analysis.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.031
Beer and diapers.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.666
Oh, it's a
classic story,

26:06.699 --> 26:07.900
most likely apocryphal,

26:07.934 --> 26:09.736
all about a grocery store
that wanted to know

26:09.769 --> 26:12.672
what items sold
most often with diapers.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.340
They discovered it was beer.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.342
Now, from this, they inferred
that the wives

26:16.375 --> 26:19.211
had delegated the diaper-buying
to their husbands,

26:19.245 --> 26:23.683
who consolidated this duty
into their weekend beer runs.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.752
They started
stocking the diapers

26:25.785 --> 26:26.653
next to the beer coolers,

26:26.686 --> 26:27.687
and increased their sales.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.757
So, using
affinity analysis

26:30.790 --> 26:32.224
and association rule mining,

26:32.258 --> 26:33.993
we determined that this
crime must have been

26:34.026 --> 26:35.261
committed by
a partnership.

26:35.294 --> 26:38.064
So, we reexamined
the relationships

26:38.097 --> 26:40.366
and behaviors of,
of your various suspects,

26:40.399 --> 26:43.670
and it keeps leading us
back to Audrey.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.037
MEGAN:
Susan's daughter?!

26:49.341 --> 26:50.977
Okay, so Charlie says to
reinterview the suspects.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.411
I think I could
have told you that.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.081
But Audrey is the one
with no motive.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.949
Not if she's helping
her boyfriend.

26:56.983 --> 26:57.950
Or her mother.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.118
I see the thinking.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.953
I say she's a wedge.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.154
That's our only move.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.155
Thanks, Peter.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.257
Oh, and Don?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.926
Quit browbeating
my assistant

27:06.959 --> 27:08.427
for personal
information on me.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.429
You gave me up?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.932
I know where my
paycheck comes from.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.268
Aha.
-Now, what makes you think

27:16.302 --> 27:18.971
that he would have
something juicy on me?

27:19.005 --> 27:20.139
I'm thorough.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.141
Oh, yeah?
What do ya got?

27:22.174 --> 27:24.243
We'll see.
I'm still compiling.

27:24.276 --> 27:27.279
Nothing.
You got nothing, Eppes.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.417
And what about the hotel?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.252
Was Audrey there with
you the whole time?

27:33.285 --> 27:35.187
No. Not the whole time.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.288
She left for an hour

27:36.322 --> 27:37.857
for dawn prayers
with her mother,

27:37.890 --> 27:38.725
but she came right back.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.127
So she had time
to poison the coffee?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.929
Audrey?

27:42.962 --> 27:45.131
COLBY: She was the only one
who didn't have an alibi

27:45.164 --> 27:46.265
for all three of the crimes--

27:46.298 --> 27:49.101
the fire, the poisonings
and the death of your father.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.241
But she handed me the coffee.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.009
The morning of the poisonings?

27:57.043 --> 27:58.010
Yeah, first thing.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.246
I mean...

28:00.279 --> 28:01.347
she poured me a cup.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.916
But she didn't have any herself?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.185
No.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.355
Oh, God...

28:09.388 --> 28:11.057
What?

28:11.090 --> 28:11.891
Well, before
the church exploded,

28:11.924 --> 28:14.827
she called us over,
Father and me.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.232
Audrey's the only person
in the entire church

28:20.266 --> 28:23.903
who doesn't have an alibi for
all three of the incidents.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.371
Why would she need an alibi?

28:25.404 --> 28:26.405
Because we have
a statement

28:26.438 --> 28:28.374
implicating her
in the poisoning.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.109
SUSAN:
What?

28:30.142 --> 28:31.343
MEGAN: Your daughter
set you up, Susan.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.912
She killed your husband.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.814
Is she working with Craig?
No!

28:34.847 --> 28:38.250
Is she working
with you?

28:38.284 --> 28:40.920
I know I am being tested.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.789
We found arsenic
all over your house.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.357
If it wasn't you, it was Audrey.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.862
She had nothing to do with it.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.097
I did it.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.331
I did it all.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.866
What did you do?

28:53.900 --> 28:55.401
Poisoned the coffee.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.169
Poisoned my husband.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.874
Huh. This is wrong.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.409
She's the wrong person.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.977
It's not the outcome
we expected,

29:05.011 --> 29:06.012
but they've got
their confession.

29:07.079 --> 29:07.947
You know something?

29:07.980 --> 29:10.482
I think you need to
arrest Craig Ezra.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.483
Well, how you
figure that?

29:11.517 --> 29:14.486
What we may have here
is the test of Solomon.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.188
Now, if so,
Susan Doran just now

29:16.222 --> 29:18.190
sacrificed herself
for her daughter.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.192
Okay? You tried
to cut her baby in half.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.327
She wouldn't let you,
no matter how much

29:21.360 --> 29:23.195
the cost to herself.
-And then Craig

29:23.229 --> 29:24.831
fed her to the wolves.
-LARRY: That's it.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.298
CHARLIE: However, it's pretty
counter-intuitive

29:26.332 --> 29:27.967
that he would put himself
in harm's way twice.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.802
And still he survives.
-Hold on.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.104
A Bible story's not
gonna trump a confession.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.973
No, I mean, obviously,
with real stories of faith,

29:34.006 --> 29:35.474
you know, they don't
have easy answers,

29:35.507 --> 29:38.377
but this story does give
us a place to find them.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.245
All right,
you know what?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.047
Given the results
of the interviews,

29:41.080 --> 29:42.915
why don't... why don't
you give us some time

29:42.949 --> 29:43.983
to revisit
our affinity analysis?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.417
All right, good.
Go for it.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.453
CHARLIE:
All right, so,

29:47.486 --> 29:48.487
well, this isn't working.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.389
Craig-slash-Audrey

29:50.422 --> 29:53.459
and Craig-slash-Susan
have low support values.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.394
Craig alone has
a low predictive value.

29:55.427 --> 29:58.364
I'm thinking we circle back,

29:58.397 --> 30:00.332
try a K-optimal
pattern discovery.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.500
Charles...

30:06.505 --> 30:07.940
What are we missing here?

30:07.974 --> 30:09.408
Aside from a positive result?

30:09.441 --> 30:12.411
Reverend Ezra.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.480
I'm put in mind
of one Abimelech,

30:14.513 --> 30:17.016
who slays his clan

30:17.049 --> 30:20.519
in order to rule his
family and his kingdom.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.357
Slay your clan,
poison your church.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.093
After murdering
his own people,

30:27.126 --> 30:29.495
God condemns and
kills Abimelech,

30:29.528 --> 30:31.497
but not for his sins
against his people.

30:31.530 --> 30:35.501
No, it was for dishonoring
his father, Gideon...

30:35.534 --> 30:36.969
who was already dead.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.605
Wow. I really don't
understand the Bible.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.507
Well, the point
I'm making here

30:41.540 --> 30:44.977
is that a father's influence
over his son can define him,

30:45.011 --> 30:48.147
and maybe even drive him.

30:51.683 --> 30:56.288
So Ezra-... slash-Craig.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.591
That's a relationship we
haven't been focusing on.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.328
DAVID: Before 1998,
a Joseph and Emily Ezra

31:02.361 --> 31:03.529
lived in Bangor, Maine,

31:03.562 --> 31:05.464
They went to work,
went to school,

31:05.497 --> 31:08.600
they paid taxes...
and then... nothing.

31:08.634 --> 31:09.701
(typing)

31:09.735 --> 31:14.573
Now, between 1998 and 2005,
the Ezras did not exist.

31:14.606 --> 31:18.077
No credit cards, no drivers'
license, no taxes-- nada.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.679
Then Joseph and Craig Ezra
showed up at Patmos.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.082
So, what happened in 1998?

31:23.115 --> 31:28.554
I think the real Joseph
and Emily Ezra, they died.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.956
A car crash.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.958
The bodies were burned
beyond recognition,

31:31.991 --> 31:34.560
no match to dental records,
the identities went unknown.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.428
1998.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.097
Portland, Maine.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.432
I know you got more than this.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.101
Yes, I do.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.436
Before the Ezras went missing...

31:44.470 --> 31:45.938
they had a foster child.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.075
MEGAN:
That would be Craig.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.245
Craig?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.982
Hey, Craig, we're gonna
need to speak to you

31:56.015 --> 31:57.950
for a second.
-What for?

31:57.984 --> 31:59.651
Just want to talk to you.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.720
About Audrey?

32:01.753 --> 32:02.621
Me?

32:02.654 --> 32:03.555
Ah!

32:03.589 --> 32:05.557
Come on!
You okay?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.393
DON:
Hey!

32:07.426 --> 32:08.260
Ezra!

32:09.261 --> 32:10.629
Craig, stop!

32:10.662 --> 32:11.630
DON:
Hey!

32:17.269 --> 32:18.404
Colby!
-Gotcha!

32:18.437 --> 32:20.306
(clattering)

32:36.622 --> 32:37.589
(engine starting)

32:37.623 --> 32:39.491
(tires screeching)

32:46.665 --> 32:48.634
This is Eppes. You need to
run California plates:

32:48.667 --> 32:51.570
four, David, ocean,
queen, six, seven, eight.

32:51.603 --> 32:52.738
You all right, Colb?

32:52.771 --> 32:54.606
Yeah. Yeah.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.747
DON: All right, so
Craig ditched the car.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.150
And we got no bites
on the APB.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.185
DAVID: William Boone.
Bunko has a long rap sheet

33:06.218 --> 33:08.354
on this guy; he's got
short cons, fraud, scams,

33:08.387 --> 33:09.688
been in and out of jail.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.157
He drops off
the radar in 2005.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.658
Oh.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.794
COLBY: William Boone and Craig
set up shop at the church

33:15.827 --> 33:18.530
as father and son,
Joseph and Craig Ezra,

33:18.564 --> 33:20.032
working a long con.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.700
Life con.
You don't get

33:21.733 --> 33:24.603
into the tax-exempt business
looking for a quick buck.

33:24.636 --> 33:25.804
Boone had
a retirement plan.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.439
Okay.
-DAVID: Craig kills

33:27.473 --> 33:30.076
Reverend Doran while
Ezra-slash-Boone is away.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.078
And Boone poisons the coffee
while Craig's away.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.047
This way, they both alibi out
for the other murder.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.149
And I think church poisoning
was meant to be minimal.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.318
You know, just enough
to sicken people

33:39.351 --> 33:40.586
and give Patmos the option

33:40.619 --> 33:42.088
of accepting
medical treatment.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.390
DAVID: They drop controversial
beliefs, including

33:44.423 --> 33:45.757
the mandatory
faith-based healing.

33:45.791 --> 33:46.792
They fall off the cult list,

33:46.825 --> 33:49.095
get recognized
as a real church,

33:49.128 --> 33:50.162
get the tax-exempt status.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.297
So what are you thinking?

33:51.330 --> 33:54.133
Boone gets greedy and
uses more poison than planned?

33:54.166 --> 33:55.767
COLBY: Yeah, Craig drinks it
'cause he thinks

33:55.801 --> 33:58.204
it's going to be mild,
ends up almost dying.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.506
So, to pay Boone back,
he decides to blow him up.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.773
And these guys go to war

34:01.807 --> 34:03.475
against each other,
but at the same time,

34:03.509 --> 34:05.111
they keep pointing the finger
at Susan Doran.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.280
MEGAN: So Craig's got three
years invested in this scam.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.149
Now he's out in the cold,
he has nothing.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.850
And that church has
a safe full of money.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.153
I bet he's just
obsessing about it.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.622
Sure. All right, he knows
better, but he's a con artist,

34:16.655 --> 34:18.357
so he's always going to be
thinking about that score.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.859
Audrey?

34:20.892 --> 34:22.394
If she agrees,
we can run a sting on Craig.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.263
Sure.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.600
And if I don't agree?

34:28.634 --> 34:30.702
Then he gets away
with killing your father

34:30.736 --> 34:32.238
and destroying
your mother.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.143
Audrey, he gave us
enough testimony

34:37.176 --> 34:38.677
to get you the death penalty.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.812
He literally
threw you at us.

34:40.846 --> 34:41.813
He was scared.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.550
He was scared he'd get nailed

34:44.583 --> 34:46.185
for blowing up that church,
killing his dad

34:46.218 --> 34:47.386
and trying to kill you.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.621
He never tried to kill me.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.564
Audrey...

34:58.597 --> 35:01.700
he left you
in a burning building.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.869
He loves me.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.609
There's somebody that loves you,

35:10.642 --> 35:12.344
it is just not Craig.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.182
Here.
(remote clicks)

35:16.215 --> 35:18.517
MEAGAN: If it wasn't you,
it was Audrey.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.720
SUSAN:
She had nothing to do with it.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.589
I did it.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.656
I did it all.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.657
You did what?

35:25.691 --> 35:27.626
Poisoned the coffee.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.261
Poisoned my husband.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.234
(steam hissing)

35:35.267 --> 35:36.368
Oh, dear.

35:36.402 --> 35:37.703
You all right? Here.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.206
Let me give you a hand.
I got it. Thanks.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.173
There you go.

35:41.207 --> 35:44.476
I think this cappuccino
is a vanished dream.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.513
Have the regular stuff.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.215
Hey, nice turnaround
on Susan Doran.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.617
Well, it's no easy thing.
I'll tell you--

35:51.650 --> 35:53.952
separating the ugliness
of her dogma

35:53.985 --> 35:55.587
from the sincerity
of her faith.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.423
Yeah, I agree.

35:57.456 --> 36:01.193
You know, you with your job,
there's so many horrific things

36:01.227 --> 36:03.262
that you hear people say or do.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.863
How do you
shrug that off?

36:04.896 --> 36:07.666
Alcohol.
(wry chuckle)

36:07.699 --> 36:09.768
No, look, I-I try to remember

36:09.801 --> 36:11.337
the job's more
important than me.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.272
Well, we all

36:13.305 --> 36:16.575
pray at our own
unique altars, don't we?

36:16.608 --> 36:19.311
Well...

36:19.345 --> 36:22.248
you know, I think
of religion as a...

36:22.281 --> 36:24.216
a really good police force,
you know?

36:24.250 --> 36:26.352
It keeps 90% of
the people honest

36:26.385 --> 36:27.719
and then we worry
about the other ten.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.787
That's religion.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.855
How about belief?

36:30.956 --> 36:32.258
Well, look,

36:32.291 --> 36:34.393
you know we weren't a big
"God house."

36:34.426 --> 36:39.431
I just always figured
one exists, but...

36:39.465 --> 36:40.866
that's pretty much
the extent of it.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.269
Pascal's Wager.

36:43.302 --> 36:44.836
One lives as if God exists.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.938
If He does,
your gain is infinite.

36:46.972 --> 36:50.809
If He doesn't, well,
you've lost nothing.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.944
Think Vegas gives odds on that?

36:52.978 --> 36:56.315
(wry laugh)

36:56.348 --> 36:59.618
You don't feel any...
any emptiness in this?

36:59.651 --> 37:02.788
Ah, well, hence the alcohol.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.825
Well...

37:10.896 --> 37:12.864
They let my mom go an hour ago.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.300
I think they're
going to arrest me.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.734
CRAIG (on phone):
The church has been

37:15.767 --> 37:17.035
tainted by outsiders.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.838
We have to rebuild it.
-How?

37:19.871 --> 37:21.740
We need the money.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.908
It's the right thing to do.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.710
I mean, you know
the combination.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.845
To start again, we need a lot.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.314
As much as you can take.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.850
Okay.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.652
Okay, yes.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.957
Where should I meet you?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.460
Union Station in an hour,
main entrance.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.996
Audrey, I love you.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.900
I love you, too.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.851
All right, there he is.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.052
We moving in?
-Let him take the bag.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.455
What if he wants
to take her with him?

38:09.488 --> 38:11.957
DON: Don't worry,
not this guy.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.925
I wasn't sure.
I didn't think

38:13.959 --> 38:15.093
you were going
to make it.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.294
How much did you get?

38:17.529 --> 38:18.997
I don't know, a lot.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.800
Okay, look, go back to Patmos,

38:21.833 --> 38:23.034
and, um...

38:23.068 --> 38:24.770
I'll call you as soon
as I find a safe place.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.872
Craig...
-Trust me, Audrey.

38:26.905 --> 38:27.939
This is for the best.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.411
Bitch!

38:38.083 --> 38:39.418
Please! Move!

38:39.451 --> 38:41.086
Move!

38:42.388 --> 38:43.689
Audrey, come with me.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.399
Not sure where
you're going, buddy.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.601
DAVID: I'm pretty sure the top
of this tower doesn't come out

38:55.634 --> 38:57.636
in Mexico!

39:02.974 --> 39:05.444
Mom!

39:07.178 --> 39:09.681
Clear the bottom!
Clear the bottom!

39:09.715 --> 39:10.949
DAVID:
Come on, Craig!

39:10.982 --> 39:12.618
We know who you really are.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.753
You're not
the jumping type!

39:17.088 --> 39:18.957
DON:
Freeze!

39:18.990 --> 39:21.092
Don't move!
Freeze!

39:21.126 --> 39:22.093
Take it easy.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.094
Nice and easy.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.696
That's it.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.665
(panting)

39:28.634 --> 39:30.001
Now get your hands
on your head.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.703
Get them up!
-She told me to do it.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.139
Everything.
"She"?

39:34.172 --> 39:35.507
Which one?

39:35.541 --> 39:37.409
Audrey.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.010
Audrey told me to do everything.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.879
DAVID:
Seriously?

39:40.912 --> 39:43.114
I bet Colby 20 he'd blame Susan.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.819
WOMAN (on TV):
...stay out of town.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.820
MAN (on TV):
Thanks.

39:48.854 --> 39:49.621
I know 50 times as much

39:49.655 --> 39:51.022
about trouble
as you ever will.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.091
Besides, you
owe it to me.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.594
You sort of belong to me,
when you're a hobo.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.962
I found you.
-DON: Careful.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.096
MAN (on TV):
Careful.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.498
(reciting with TV):
I tell you it's

39:59.531 --> 40:00.999
absolutely out
of the question.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.100
(remote clicks)

40:02.133 --> 40:03.635
You know every line?

40:03.669 --> 40:05.971
Not on purpose.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.182
Yes?

40:17.215 --> 40:18.750
Thanks for not making me
watch Heat.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.486
(chuckles)

40:21.587 --> 40:24.055
Oh, I forgot.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.660
For you.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.796
Chocolates?

40:30.829 --> 40:32.664
You know what,
not a big fan.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.600
I don't know anyone who
doesn't like chocolate.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.167
Mm, I expected better

40:36.201 --> 40:38.837
investigative prowess
from you, Agent Eppes.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.172
I see-- so that's it? You're not
even going to open them?

40:43.241 --> 40:44.142
Okay.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.118
It's watermelon?
-Aha.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.053
That's my favorite.
-Aha, ha, ha.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.992
See?

41:03.094 --> 41:04.162
How did you know?

41:04.195 --> 41:05.664
No one knows.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.567
(remote clicks)
Ball's in your court, kid.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.101
WOMAN (on TV): Yes, I'll follow
you and I'll holler,

41:10.135 --> 41:12.704
"This guy's a phony,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.139
"This is Sullivan, the big
director from Hollywood.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.642
A phonus-balonus,
a faker, a heel..."

41:16.675 --> 41:18.610
MAN 2: If I man join
in the controversy, sir,

41:18.644 --> 41:20.579
I think the young lady's
suggestion is excellent.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.747
(movie dialogue fades)

41:21.780 --> 41:23.515
Emergency retrieval
equipment?

41:23.549 --> 41:25.551
Check.
-Drying mechanism, check.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.718
Okay, have we
thought of everything?

41:26.752 --> 41:29.621
Only one way to find out.
-Break.

41:29.655 --> 41:30.789
I don't know,
it kind of looks

41:30.822 --> 41:31.890
like it did the
other day, but...

41:34.025 --> 41:35.093
Um, all righty, wish me luck.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.027
(Charlie chuckles)

41:36.061 --> 41:37.228
Oh, oh, wait, wait,
Charlie, you forgot

41:37.262 --> 41:38.664
to take your shoes off.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.865
No, I didn't.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.301
(screaming)

41:43.334 --> 41:45.203
(cheering and applause)

41:49.107 --> 41:50.809
(laughs)

41:50.842 --> 41:52.778
(cheering and applause)

41:57.315 --> 41:58.183
Okay, who's next?

41:58.216 --> 42:00.051
(screams)

42:00.085 --> 42:03.722
* Call me when your feet
hit the ground *

42:03.755 --> 42:05.657
* Baby, take a look

42:05.691 --> 42:09.628
* Baby, take a good look
around. *
