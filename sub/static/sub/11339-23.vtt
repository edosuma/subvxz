01:01.312 --> 01:03.914
Hey, is there a problem
with the pump?

01:03.981 --> 01:05.482
Negative.
The pump is fine.

01:05.550 --> 01:08.452
Stand by. Let me check
the pressure.

01:08.519 --> 01:10.487
Good. It's all good.

01:10.555 --> 01:12.489
All right. Something
must be blocking it.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.157
- Boo!
- What, man!

01:17.962 --> 01:20.297
Kill the pump! Kill the pump!

01:20.364 --> 01:21.665
Kill the pump!

01:21.733 --> 01:23.066
Kill the pump!

01:23.134 --> 01:25.268
You gotta help me, man!
Come on!

01:39.131 --> 01:40.765
The barge moves
up and down the coast

01:40.850 --> 01:43.101
repairing beaches
from weather damage.

01:43.185 --> 01:46.071
And how deep is the water that
this sand's coming from?

01:46.138 --> 01:48.189
About 100 meters.
The pump spews out

01:48.257 --> 01:50.091
all kinds of stuff
from the ocean floor.

01:50.159 --> 01:51.526
And you do this
every year?

01:51.594 --> 01:53.529
First time in Jacksonville.
We just moved the barge here

01:53.547 --> 01:54.748
3 days ago.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.082
Thousands of miles
of open water

01:56.150 --> 01:58.752
and blind luck uncovers
an unsub's graveyard.

01:58.819 --> 02:02.088
I had them stop the pump
once I realized what this was.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.757
We're going to need you
to turn the pump back on.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.425
If we don't keep digging,
we're not gonna know

02:05.493 --> 02:07.911
how many bodies
there are down there.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.795
What'd you find?

02:09.864 --> 02:11.281
A scary math problem.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.800
I just finished doing my
Jacksonville missing persons sweep.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.086
There are 6 unresolved
cases, 3 of which are kids,

02:16.170 --> 02:17.904
and you have 9 adult bodies.

02:17.955 --> 02:20.473
Then he's not hunting here.
Widen your search.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.791
Yeah, I will do that.
Just remember,

02:21.876 --> 02:24.611
it is difficult to I.D. match
a thigh bone or coccyx.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.296
- Agent Hotchner.
- Yes, sir.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.798
Detective Foreman.
Call me JT.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.967
Not the most
cushy arrangement,

02:31.051 --> 02:32.986
but it'll keep your team close
to the crime scene for now.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.487
- Well, thank you for setting it up.
- Of course.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.272
This will help us
preserve what we can.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.307
Excuse me.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.525
Yeah, I'm back.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.477
You know, based on
the parasites

02:40.561 --> 02:42.312
on the most recent kill,
the unsub killed

02:42.396 --> 02:43.863
as recently
as a month ago,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.165
which means
he's still active.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.649
How did you establish
a timeline so quickly?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.451
By reverse engineering
mother nature. Each year,

02:48.536 --> 02:50.153
sand and sediment
cover up the remains,

02:50.237 --> 02:51.905
creating layers
on the ocean floor.

02:51.956 --> 02:54.374
That makes sense. The deeper
the pump dug, the older the remains.

02:54.441 --> 02:57.327
9 victims in 9 years means that
he's in control of his urges.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.344
Any sense of the victimology?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.846
Only that he likes variety.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.448
Pelvic bone width indicates
that he kills both men and woman,

03:02.500 --> 03:05.118
and skull structure says
he crosses racial lines as well.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.619
Agent Hotchner, excuse me.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.188
We found 3 more remains.

03:10.007 --> 03:11.925
If he's been dumping
this long,

03:11.992 --> 03:13.292
it's not just
out of convenience.

03:13.344 --> 03:15.028
There's got to be
an emotional tie as well.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.462
He'll change his M.O.
because he has to,

03:16.514 --> 03:17.997
but he won't be happy
about it.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.517
Then he'll have the entire
Atlantic to choose from.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.241
Help!

03:28.309 --> 03:30.309
Help!

03:31.862 --> 03:34.614
Help!

of human restlessness."

04:24.062 --> 04:25.512
Joseph Conrad.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.015
You know, that site is known for
record catches of yellowmouth.

04:28.082 --> 04:29.352
So the unsub was smart enough

04:29.377 --> 04:31.279
to dump during the off season
and avoid fishermen.

04:31.302 --> 04:32.519
Then he's a local.

04:32.586 --> 04:33.854
I'm afraid to ask--

04:33.921 --> 04:35.355
could this be
one of my guys?

04:35.423 --> 04:37.858
We run interdiction
exercises around that spot.

04:37.925 --> 04:39.443
No, it's most likely
another fisherman.

04:39.527 --> 04:40.794
Well,
how could you know?

04:40.862 --> 04:42.562
Come here,
I'll show you.

04:45.984 --> 04:48.368
See, he disarticulates
the bodies at the joints.

04:48.436 --> 04:49.870
It helps them sink.

04:49.937 --> 04:51.872
Now, that's a skill that only
an experienced butcher

04:51.939 --> 04:53.373
or fisherman would have.

04:53.441 --> 04:55.042
The bone nicks indicate
this guy inflicted

04:55.109 --> 04:58.145
a lot of pain on his victims,
which means he's a sadist.

04:58.212 --> 04:59.346
Wow.

05:00.348 --> 05:01.748
Excuse me.

05:03.918 --> 05:07.354
Enchantress of all things
possible. Use your imagination.

05:07.422 --> 05:09.723
Can you enchant me with a list
of boat owners in Jacksonville?

05:09.790 --> 05:12.359
You know I can, baby.
Ok, in Duvall County

05:12.427 --> 05:14.945
we're looking at 31,047
registered boats.

05:15.013 --> 05:16.330
Well, limit that
to the boats

05:16.397 --> 05:18.231
that can only be operated
by one person.

05:18.299 --> 05:20.334
Ok, I'm gonna need a lot
more than this to do that.

05:20.401 --> 05:22.135
It's still looking like a list

05:22.203 --> 05:24.804
that makes "War and Peace"
read like a comic book.

05:25.907 --> 05:27.107
Hey, you ok?

05:28.376 --> 05:30.861
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

05:30.945 --> 05:32.645
I'll keep you posted.

05:32.697 --> 05:34.814
Aye aye, Captain.

05:36.084 --> 05:39.753
Why wouldn't you be ok?

05:39.820 --> 05:41.755
It's just in cases
like these

05:41.822 --> 05:43.190
where there's only
pieces, it's tough.

05:43.257 --> 05:44.858
The best we can do
is catalog them

05:44.926 --> 05:46.677
and wait for the unsub
to screw up somewhere else.

05:46.761 --> 05:48.462
You think he's moved on?

05:48.563 --> 05:50.197
If he's smart he has.

05:50.264 --> 05:53.100
And so far, this guy
seems very smart.

05:55.103 --> 05:57.404
Have you nailed down
the victimology?

05:57.472 --> 05:59.022
I found a unique
evolution, actually.

05:59.107 --> 06:01.224
The earliest victims
appear to be high-risk.

06:01.309 --> 06:03.143
These lesions are
consistent with syphilis,

06:03.211 --> 06:04.478
most likely a prostitute.

06:04.545 --> 06:06.813
This one has severely
ground and missing teeth,

06:06.881 --> 06:09.483
commonly seen in excessive
methamphetamine abuse.

06:09.534 --> 06:11.118
And then all of a sudden
out of nowhere,

06:11.185 --> 06:12.319
a sea change--

06:12.370 --> 06:13.653
healthier
and stronger victims

06:13.705 --> 06:15.288
all the way through
to number 12.

06:15.356 --> 06:17.157
Lower-risk,
harder for him to hunt.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.792
What do we know
about the first victim?

06:18.860 --> 06:19.960
You know,
that one's tough.

06:20.027 --> 06:21.578
He or she has been
in the water so long,

06:21.662 --> 06:23.080
they're mostly
bone fragments.

06:23.164 --> 06:24.297
I can attempt
to reconstruct--

06:24.365 --> 06:25.766
You've got 3 hours.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.334
I can do it in 2.

06:27.385 --> 06:28.719
Make it one.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.094
How much has gotten out?

06:37.178 --> 06:40.514
Can't tell. Some of these
news crews are national.

06:40.565 --> 06:43.517
If the unsub doesn't know
we found his graveyard yet,

06:43.584 --> 06:44.818
he will soon.

06:44.886 --> 06:46.453
Then we'll hear from everyone

06:46.521 --> 06:49.189
who's ever filed
a missing persons report.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.092
Maybe we can use this
to our advantage.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.528
I could talk to them.

06:54.595 --> 06:56.396
It might feed his ego,

06:56.464 --> 06:58.198
take the sting out
of him losing his site.

06:58.266 --> 06:59.766
It could keep him
in the area.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.868
Good.

07:04.905 --> 07:07.124
At this moment it would be
premature to comment

07:07.208 --> 07:08.809
on the details of the case.

07:08.876 --> 07:12.312
Our goal is to identify the recovered
remains as quickly as possible

07:12.380 --> 07:13.746
for the families involved.

07:13.798 --> 07:16.316
In order to expedite that,
we're asking

07:16.384 --> 07:18.585
that the families or friends
of people who went missing

07:18.653 --> 07:20.654
on the east coast
of the United States

07:20.721 --> 07:23.106
since the year 2000
come forward.

07:23.191 --> 07:25.025
We'll be matching DNA
to the remains,

07:25.092 --> 07:27.944
and it will be helpful for
us to have a personal item

07:28.029 --> 07:29.980
from each
of the missing persons.

07:30.064 --> 07:31.731
An article of clothing,
a hairbrush,

07:31.799 --> 07:34.034
a blanket, a pillowcase,

07:34.101 --> 07:36.486
photographs or medical or
dental records if you have them.

07:36.571 --> 07:38.872
We're also looking
for items of significance

07:38.940 --> 07:42.509
to help us determine the last known
whereabouts of each of the victims.

07:42.577 --> 07:46.513
Correspondence like letters
or emails will be helpful.

07:46.581 --> 07:50.050
Morgan was telling me how
difficult these cases can be.

07:50.117 --> 07:52.552
Who did he lose?

07:52.620 --> 07:54.354
Aunt Yvonne.
How you doing?

07:54.422 --> 07:57.824
Derek, is my baby girl
on that beach?

07:57.892 --> 07:59.526
We've talked about this.

07:59.594 --> 08:02.262
There's no reason to think
she'd be down here.

08:02.330 --> 08:05.265
She went missing 7 years ago
and from Charleston.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.933
That's east coast,
just like your boss said.

08:07.001 --> 08:08.401
Come on now, auntie,

08:08.469 --> 08:10.303
we both know
what happened to Cindi.

08:10.371 --> 08:12.972
Somehow you're just gonna
have to learn to accept it.

08:13.024 --> 08:14.841
I'll stay in touch.

08:14.909 --> 08:16.676
Ok. Thank you, Derek.

08:25.536 --> 08:27.487
Some years back,

08:27.555 --> 08:29.789
Morgan's cousin
fled a stalker.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.092
She made it
to South Carolina.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.594
She was never seen
or heard from again.

08:34.662 --> 08:36.363
Was it the stalker?

08:36.429 --> 08:37.864
He killed himself
2 weeks later,

08:37.932 --> 08:39.900
so we never found out
for sure.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.836
But Morgan's profile
led straight to him.

08:42.904 --> 08:47.207
So whenever unidentified
female remains turn up...

08:47.275 --> 08:49.776
He gets that call.

09:10.197 --> 09:12.299
Why are you doing this?

09:12.366 --> 09:14.501
Come on, man.

09:15.503 --> 09:18.037
Come on, man,
talk to me.

09:27.315 --> 09:29.316
No, no, no, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

09:29.383 --> 09:31.751
Listen! Not again.

09:31.819 --> 09:33.320
Why are you doing this?

09:33.387 --> 09:34.487
Uhh!

09:34.555 --> 09:36.907
Son of a...Bitch!

09:52.089 --> 09:55.375
Alex Cottle, Beth Riley,
Louise Jones,

09:55.426 --> 09:58.011
come with me, please.

09:58.078 --> 10:00.430
We were working on a gene
therapy project at Johns Hopkins

10:00.514 --> 10:02.282
when Samantha got the news.

10:02.350 --> 10:03.350
Parkinson's.

10:03.417 --> 10:04.851
That must have been
pretty rough on her.

10:04.919 --> 10:06.319
I was her best friend,

10:06.387 --> 10:08.939
and all I ever got
was this postcard.

10:13.594 --> 10:15.629
"Weze, I'm not
going back to school.

10:15.696 --> 10:17.197
"There's nothing there
for me.

10:17.264 --> 10:19.933
I need to find myself.
Love, Sammy."

10:20.001 --> 10:21.468
Does this sound
like her to you?

10:21.535 --> 10:23.203
Not really, no.

10:23.270 --> 10:25.538
She would have written
a 12-page letter.

10:25.606 --> 10:27.440
But she addressed it
to "Weze."

10:27.508 --> 10:30.543
She's the only one
who called me that.

10:32.279 --> 10:35.315
I'd like to keep this if that's
all right. It may be evidence.

10:35.383 --> 10:37.384
I...

10:37.451 --> 10:38.885
Yeah, ok.

10:38.953 --> 10:40.720
Thank you.

10:40.788 --> 10:42.472
Did you happen to bring
anything of hers

10:42.556 --> 10:43.957
that we could get
DNA from?

10:44.025 --> 10:45.525
Well, everyone
on the project

10:45.593 --> 10:47.761
mapped their DNA
into the database.

10:47.828 --> 10:50.313
I'll need that information.

10:50.398 --> 10:51.564
You know,
on this first victim,

10:51.632 --> 10:53.066
the more I work
on this skeleton,

10:53.133 --> 10:54.734
the more I question
its condition.

10:54.802 --> 10:56.903
The ocean floor preserved the
other remains remarkably well.

10:56.971 --> 10:58.738
I think something else
caused this.

10:58.806 --> 11:01.207
Could this be the age of these
bones as opposed to the others?

11:01.275 --> 11:03.159
Well, he's significantly older.
Arthritis in the joints

11:03.244 --> 11:04.341
puts him in his late 50s,

11:04.342 --> 11:06.242
but that doesn't account
for this degree of breakdown.

11:06.247 --> 11:08.348
In fact, nothing
in the ocean would.

11:08.449 --> 11:09.833
If the unsub's responsible,

11:09.917 --> 11:12.352
maybe he didn't
disarticulate this victim

11:12.420 --> 11:13.953
but he tore him apart
instead.

11:14.005 --> 11:16.089
And look at this.
This bone has a defensive wound,

11:16.156 --> 11:17.957
like he held it up
before the blow came down.

11:18.009 --> 11:19.959
I think the bone-smashing
occurred

11:20.011 --> 11:21.628
while the victim
was still alive.

11:21.679 --> 11:23.129
Overkill.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.681
He worked out a lot
of aggression on this victim.

11:24.765 --> 11:25.865
He didn't do that
with the others.

11:25.933 --> 11:27.200
That would indicate
a personal relationship.

11:27.268 --> 11:28.368
Father?

11:28.436 --> 11:29.869
That would be my guess.
And not a good one,

11:29.937 --> 11:32.171
based on the low calcium levels
consistent with alcoholism.

11:36.944 --> 11:39.412
Think it's time
to rethink Cindi?

11:39.480 --> 11:42.382
Rossi, the only connection
right now is Charleston.

11:42.450 --> 11:43.550
It's weak.

11:43.617 --> 11:45.118
Victim number 5

11:45.186 --> 11:47.420
is an African-American
woman in her 20s

11:47.488 --> 11:49.556
who died in 2004.

11:49.623 --> 11:51.157
That's not weak.

11:51.225 --> 11:55.261
My aunt has spent years obsessing
over Cindi's last few hours.

11:55.329 --> 11:56.730
She doesn't go out.

11:56.797 --> 11:58.031
She doesn't sleep.

11:58.099 --> 12:00.400
She forgets to take
her medication.

12:00.468 --> 12:01.801
It's killing her, Rossi.

12:01.869 --> 12:04.070
It hasn't been easy
for you, either.

12:04.138 --> 12:06.673
But everything I've learned
as a profiler has taught me

12:06.741 --> 12:09.075
that it's not about
what I want to be true.

12:09.143 --> 12:10.710
It's about what I can prove.

12:11.779 --> 12:12.896
So I can't go there.

12:12.980 --> 12:14.213
We got a match.

12:15.316 --> 12:16.900
Meet our first
confirmed victim,

12:16.984 --> 12:18.269
Dr. Samantha Cormick.

12:18.294 --> 12:19.814
Since her DNA profile
was already developed,

12:19.820 --> 12:21.221
we were able to save
a couple of days.

12:21.288 --> 12:22.555
So he dumps here
and hunts in Charleston.

12:22.606 --> 12:24.824
Tourist spot.
Larger victim pool.

12:24.892 --> 12:27.393
It's a 250-mile trip back here.
It's a lot of exposure.

12:27.461 --> 12:29.129
Torture takes time
and privacy,

12:29.196 --> 12:31.631
and disarticulation
is a mess.

12:31.699 --> 12:33.533
You know, he could have
a mobile torture chamber

12:33.601 --> 12:35.435
in his truck or trailer.
We've seen that before.

12:35.503 --> 12:37.670
Or maybe he doesn't drive at all.
He could do it all from his boat.

12:37.738 --> 12:39.372
Well, if he gets them on board
in Charleston and sails them out here,

12:39.423 --> 12:40.707
he would have time
for both.

12:40.775 --> 12:42.709
And nobody would
even notice a fisherman

12:42.777 --> 12:44.043
tossing chum into the water.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.612
Yello.

12:45.679 --> 12:47.814
Garcia, we've got more
information about the unsub's boat.

12:47.882 --> 12:49.282
It might help you
narrow your list.

12:49.350 --> 12:51.618
Ok. Bring it.
Can you give us boats with cabins

12:51.685 --> 12:53.686
large enough
to hide a torture chamber?

12:53.754 --> 12:56.055
Torture chamber?
'Cause that would, yeah,

12:56.107 --> 12:58.625
totally be listed in the
manufacturer's specs of amenities.

12:58.692 --> 13:00.794
Try cabin dimensions.

13:00.861 --> 13:04.063
Start at 10 by 10 feet
and cap it at 30.

13:04.115 --> 13:05.815
That is totally
gonna take forever

13:05.900 --> 13:07.400
'cause I gotta go
record by record.

13:07.434 --> 13:09.202
You are lucky
I love you. Bye.

13:09.270 --> 13:10.336
We need to go back
to the families

13:10.404 --> 13:11.538
and see who else
got a postcard.

13:11.605 --> 13:13.206
This might finally
be a link to victimology.

13:13.274 --> 13:15.341
Sending goodbye postcards
as a ruse is a gamble.

13:15.409 --> 13:16.843
Even if written
under duress,

13:16.911 --> 13:18.978
the victim could sneak
their own message into it.

13:19.046 --> 13:21.080
I don't think this was
written under duress.

13:21.148 --> 13:24.050
You said Dr. Cormick wasn't taking
medication for Parkinson's, right?

13:24.117 --> 13:25.668
Look at her handwriting.

13:25.753 --> 13:30.006
No indication
of tremors or shaking.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.891
There's a drug called
trilamide.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.126
In minute doses
it treats Parkinson's,

13:33.194 --> 13:35.512
but its main use
is for seasickness.

13:35.629 --> 13:37.964
Something a fisherman
would have access to.

13:38.032 --> 13:39.632
And criminals
in South America.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.301
Intel reports say
they figured out

13:41.368 --> 13:42.869
a high dose makes the victim
totally compliant.

13:42.937 --> 13:44.337
Yeah, they slip it
in your drink

13:44.405 --> 13:45.688
or blow the powder
in your face

13:45.773 --> 13:47.540
and nasodermal absorption's
almost immediate.

13:47.608 --> 13:50.193
You're instantaneously
susceptible to any suggestion.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.846
There have been reports of locals
letting thugs into their apartments

13:52.913 --> 13:55.615
to rob them, even helping
them load the getaway trucks.

14:02.034 --> 14:03.935
Dad, please...

14:05.437 --> 14:06.971
Don't listen to him.

14:07.039 --> 14:08.706
Fight it.

14:08.774 --> 14:10.308
Ok.

14:19.051 --> 14:20.484
Understand?

14:20.552 --> 14:21.652
Yes.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.621
Good.

14:37.536 --> 14:39.670
It's me.

14:39.738 --> 14:42.173
It's James.

15:20.679 --> 15:22.179
Choose one.

15:31.723 --> 15:35.960
Good. That's gonna be the knife
you kill yourself with.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.597
We got 4 more postcards.
Samantha makes 5.

15:49.172 --> 15:50.506
Any patterns
geographically?

15:50.536 --> 15:52.554
Geographically each victim
was from a different state.

15:52.639 --> 15:54.139
But they all went missing
from Charleston?

15:54.206 --> 15:55.458
Two of them did.

15:55.483 --> 15:57.092
The other three were
mailed from Miami.

15:57.143 --> 15:59.311
He's bouncing between
two cities?

15:59.379 --> 16:00.646
You know, Miami
makes a lot of sense.

16:00.713 --> 16:02.581
It's a coastal town
with a lot of tourists.

16:02.649 --> 16:03.949
And by alternating
hunting grounds,

16:04.017 --> 16:05.651
he ensures that neither city
pays too much attention

16:05.718 --> 16:06.818
to people going missing.

16:06.853 --> 16:08.654
But why these 5?
What connects them?

16:08.721 --> 16:10.072
Right now it's
just the postcards.

16:10.156 --> 16:11.857
They may be the rosetta stone
that we need.

16:11.924 --> 16:13.625
You know, the victims
write the postcards,

16:13.693 --> 16:15.527
but the unsub
dictates the message.

16:15.578 --> 16:17.162
He might have revealed something
about himself through them.

16:17.230 --> 16:18.780
Start a linguistic profile.

16:18.865 --> 16:22.467
We need to sit down with the people
who got these postcards.

16:22.535 --> 16:24.953
No, boats around here
get handed down

16:25.038 --> 16:26.672
from generation
to generation.

16:26.739 --> 16:29.958
So none of the locals would
fish in Charleston and Miami?

16:30.043 --> 16:31.943
A guy like
you're describing,

16:32.011 --> 16:34.379
he starts bringing in
blackfin from Carolina

16:34.447 --> 16:36.948
or kingfish from Miami,
we'd notice.

16:37.016 --> 16:40.952
Well, if you hear
of anything that might help,

16:41.020 --> 16:43.188
please give us
a call.

16:45.191 --> 16:48.527
We need to rethink how
our unsub finds his victims.

16:48.594 --> 16:51.363
These guys are loners.
Our guy isn't.

16:51.430 --> 16:55.934
Yeah, that guy
needs good social skills,

16:56.002 --> 16:58.603
a boat that's inviting,
recreational.

16:59.706 --> 17:01.840
What if he runs
a charter outfit?

17:01.908 --> 17:04.742
Plenty of customers
in Charleston and Miami.

17:06.646 --> 17:10.682
So he takes out a group,
but how does he pick his victim?

17:10.750 --> 17:13.652
He starts with the passengers
that are traveling alone.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.554
That lets him know
they're vulnerable.

17:15.621 --> 17:17.388
Harmless questions
would tell him

17:17.457 --> 17:19.257
who would miss them
back at home.

17:19.325 --> 17:20.992
And if they pay
with a credit card,

17:21.060 --> 17:22.461
he'd just tear up
the transaction.

17:22.528 --> 17:24.796
Then there's never any
record of them being on board.

17:24.847 --> 17:27.465
Well, that might tell us
how he's hunting.

17:27.532 --> 17:30.602
The question is...Who?

17:32.138 --> 17:33.939
What brought your son
to Miami?

17:34.006 --> 17:35.240
Work.

17:36.609 --> 17:39.444
He kept saying
this was it.

17:39.495 --> 17:42.013
This is the fresh
start he needed.

17:43.449 --> 17:47.252
When did you
start to get worried?

17:47.319 --> 17:49.287
One week maybe.

17:50.623 --> 17:52.374
Why did it take you so long

17:52.458 --> 17:54.292
to file a missing persons
report?

17:54.360 --> 17:55.627
I got this postcard,

17:55.695 --> 17:57.879
and it's her handwriting.

17:57.964 --> 18:00.132
I lived with this
handwriting for 4 years.

18:00.183 --> 18:02.367
I didn't think
to question it.

18:04.303 --> 18:06.888
So you'd say she was
a responsible person?

18:06.973 --> 18:09.057
Come on, Rossi.
Yes.

18:09.142 --> 18:10.642
Next question.

18:10.693 --> 18:12.911
Look, Derek,
I know it's unpleasant.

18:12.979 --> 18:15.947
But we're looking at the
risk level of all the victims,

18:16.015 --> 18:17.949
even the potential ones.

18:18.017 --> 18:20.285
Cindi didn't drink.
She didn't do drugs.

18:20.353 --> 18:21.753
She kept a steady job.

18:21.821 --> 18:23.255
And what about the stalker?

18:23.322 --> 18:24.623
What about him?

18:24.690 --> 18:26.691
Did she sleep with him?

18:26.759 --> 18:29.127
You know the answer
to that.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.746
Well, maybe you ought
to rethink it.

18:30.830 --> 18:32.247
Maybe you'll
remember something.

18:32.331 --> 18:34.032
They went on one date.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.568
He got one
good-night kiss.

18:36.636 --> 18:39.237
But this was a classic
power assertive stalker,

18:39.305 --> 18:41.757
and I'd seen enough of these
cases to know how they end.

18:41.841 --> 18:44.075
So you encouraged her
to move.

18:44.143 --> 18:47.245
Now, you never told me that.

18:47.313 --> 18:49.147
Now, why did she go
to Charleston?

18:49.215 --> 18:51.983
I don't know.

18:52.051 --> 18:54.119
I told her to pick a city
and not to tell anyone,

18:54.187 --> 18:55.570
and that included me.

18:55.655 --> 18:58.490
Well, let's think about it
for a second.

18:58.558 --> 19:00.992
Had she been there before?
Did she have friends there?

19:01.060 --> 19:03.962
Maybe she just wanted
to be close to the ocean.

19:08.701 --> 19:10.585
What?

19:11.954 --> 19:15.574
Fourth of July 1996.

19:15.641 --> 19:18.743
The whole family was
picnicking on the lake.

19:18.811 --> 19:21.179
And all the kids
ended up on paddle boats.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.049
And was Cindi
on one of them?

19:24.116 --> 19:26.351
No. No,
that's what's weird.

19:27.453 --> 19:30.472
She stayed on the shore
the whole day.

19:33.526 --> 19:35.260
Tell your son
you abandoned him.

19:38.030 --> 19:39.664
I didn't.

19:39.732 --> 19:41.766
- Do it.
- Ohh!

19:51.777 --> 19:54.379
Then why did you
give up custody?

19:54.447 --> 19:57.549
I couldn't afford
the lawyers anymore.

19:57.617 --> 19:59.985
It just got to the point

20:00.052 --> 20:02.120
where I had to get on
with my life.

20:04.790 --> 20:05.891
But he wouldn't let you.

20:05.958 --> 20:07.359
Would you?

20:07.426 --> 20:09.361
Tell him you hate him.

20:09.428 --> 20:11.162
No.

20:11.230 --> 20:12.497
Do it!

20:21.307 --> 20:24.709
Tell him exactly
how you felt at that time.

20:24.777 --> 20:26.678
I--

20:26.712 --> 20:29.948
I just stopped loving you.

20:44.931 --> 20:47.465
You have something you want
to say to your father?

20:53.339 --> 20:54.706
Dad...

20:54.774 --> 20:57.676
Please...

20:57.743 --> 20:59.878
Stop stabbing yourself.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.619
The unsub we're looking for

21:07.686 --> 21:09.788
is a 30- to 40-year-old
fisherman currently chartering

21:09.855 --> 21:12.457
his boat to tourists trying
to find a victim of medium risk.

21:12.524 --> 21:14.659
What's medium risk?

21:14.710 --> 21:17.295
Say your car breaks down
in a bad neighborhood.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.797
Once you're outside
your normal routine,

21:18.864 --> 21:20.799
there's a greater chance
for victimization.

21:20.866 --> 21:22.050
Hence, medium risk.

21:22.134 --> 21:24.202
Each of these victims
was trying to start over.

21:24.253 --> 21:26.304
They were out of a relationship
or starting a new job,

21:26.372 --> 21:29.474
but to this unsub, they were
abandoning their responsibilities.

21:29.541 --> 21:32.143
We can tell this in the messages
that he forces them to write.

21:32.211 --> 21:33.478
"It's too much."

21:33.545 --> 21:34.980
"There's nothing for me here."

21:35.047 --> 21:36.731
"It's better if I leave."

21:36.816 --> 21:40.652
We believe this anger stems from
his first victim--his father.

21:40.719 --> 21:43.321
Most likely a local fisherman,
definitely an alcoholic,

21:43.389 --> 21:45.156
and based on this unsub's
level of sadism,

21:45.224 --> 21:46.558
violently abusive.

21:46.626 --> 21:48.960
He's also the first person
to abandon the unsub.

21:49.028 --> 21:52.280
Walked out on his family, maybe,
even wrote a postcard like this.

21:52.365 --> 21:55.667
So the unsub picked a site
of significance to them both,

21:55.735 --> 21:58.770
a spot known to local fisherman
that he turned into his prison.

21:58.838 --> 22:01.339
But that's gone now,
so where will he head next?

22:01.407 --> 22:02.807
Well, he can't go back
to that spot,

22:02.875 --> 22:04.609
but he won't leave
Jacksonville either.

22:04.677 --> 22:06.244
That prison was
his responsibility,

22:06.312 --> 22:07.762
and without it,
he'll cling to what he knows.

22:07.847 --> 22:10.248
He'll change his M.O., and
that'll make him erratic.

22:10.316 --> 22:13.802
He'll escalate his sadism
and he'll kill uncontrollably

22:13.886 --> 22:16.287
until he finds another spot in
the ocean to replace this one.

22:16.355 --> 22:18.273
Thank you very much.

22:18.357 --> 22:19.607
Aunt Yvonne.

22:19.692 --> 22:23.761
He said
you would need DNA.

22:35.541 --> 22:39.044
I hated you when you left.

22:39.111 --> 22:41.513
Did you know that?

22:41.580 --> 22:43.481
Yeah.

22:43.549 --> 22:45.817
So why did you even
take me back?

22:45.885 --> 22:47.585
James--

22:50.556 --> 22:53.224
I couldn't live
without you anymore.

22:53.292 --> 22:57.128
And I won't let you
go again, I promise.

22:58.330 --> 23:00.231
Dad...

23:00.299 --> 23:01.900
What are we gonna do?

23:02.902 --> 23:04.903
I'll figure it out.

23:10.159 --> 23:12.510
I was right, wasn't I?

23:12.578 --> 23:15.146
You found her body
on the beach.

23:15.214 --> 23:17.449
Actually, we're trying
to rule her out.

23:17.516 --> 23:19.718
I know you, Derek.

23:19.785 --> 23:21.920
I know that look
in your eye.

23:21.987 --> 23:24.355
There is something,
isn't there?

23:24.423 --> 23:28.293
Auntie, I've been doing
this job a long time.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.962
The things I've seen...

23:31.030 --> 23:32.497
I don't want to drag
you into them.

23:32.565 --> 23:35.166
Honey, I'm already in.
You don't have to protect me.

23:35.234 --> 23:38.303
I need to find out
about my Cindi.

23:42.074 --> 23:43.174
All right.

23:43.242 --> 23:44.676
One of the victims
that we found

23:44.744 --> 23:46.594
fits Cindi's
general description.

23:46.679 --> 23:48.446
I am not saying
that it's her.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.548
But if it is, something
doesn't add up.

23:50.616 --> 23:52.450
That's why I'm here.
I'm hoping you can help.

23:53.586 --> 23:55.286
Was Cindi afraid of water?

23:55.354 --> 23:57.288
No. She loved to swim.

23:57.356 --> 23:59.023
It's just that one of
the fourth of July picnics

23:59.091 --> 24:01.058
I remember she wouldn't
get on the paddle boats.

24:01.110 --> 24:02.911
Oh, well, boats were
a whole different story.

24:02.995 --> 24:04.929
If Cindi as much as
sat in a canoe,

24:04.997 --> 24:06.831
she'd get violently
seasick.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.953
He's not finding
his victims through his boat?

24:12.037 --> 24:13.858
If he tried to talk Cindi
into a charter,

24:13.883 --> 24:15.039
she wouldn't even stop.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.341
His ruse doesn't fit her.

24:16.408 --> 24:18.109
We don't know that
she's victim number 5.

24:18.177 --> 24:19.626
I still rushed her DNA
to Quantico.

24:19.627 --> 24:20.650
They're working on it for me.

24:20.662 --> 24:22.630
But until we get a confirmation,
we can't make any assumptions

24:22.681 --> 24:23.815
based on her behavior.

24:23.883 --> 24:25.483
I'm not saying that
we throw away the profile.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.769
I'm just saying
let's expand our thinking.

24:29.087 --> 24:30.138
Magic eightball.

24:30.222 --> 24:32.791
Garcia, we're looking
into other ways

24:32.858 --> 24:34.325
that the unsub might be
finding his victims.

24:34.393 --> 24:36.728
What are the victims' histories
in Charleston or Miami?

24:36.779 --> 24:40.999
Of the 5 we've I.D.'d
so far...

24:41.066 --> 24:42.033
There isn't any.

24:42.101 --> 24:43.168
Maybe he meets them
in transit.

24:43.235 --> 24:44.335
How did they get there?

24:44.403 --> 24:45.670
Right. Right.

24:45.738 --> 24:47.539
Ok.

24:47.606 --> 24:49.908
Um, but there's nothing
there either.

24:49.975 --> 24:51.008
But how is that possible?

24:51.033 --> 24:52.374
These people are starting
their lives over.

24:52.444 --> 24:53.545
The whole point
is to travel.

24:53.612 --> 24:55.046
Even if they paid cash,
Garcia,

24:55.114 --> 24:56.314
there'd be a name
on a ticket.

24:56.382 --> 24:57.682
Yeah. No, I agree
with you,

24:57.750 --> 25:00.168
but my binary boxes
are never wrong,

25:00.252 --> 25:03.121
so however these folks got from
point "A" to point unsub,

25:03.189 --> 25:04.656
there's no record of.

25:04.723 --> 25:07.492
This guy's not abducting them
in Miami or Charleston.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.360
He's grabbing them
while they're en route.

25:53.539 --> 25:56.541
Clean it up!

26:04.516 --> 26:06.150
Aah!

26:25.971 --> 26:27.171
Aah!

26:32.728 --> 26:34.445
Dad!

26:34.513 --> 26:36.681
Dad!

27:11.983 --> 27:13.968
You know, if the unsub's
abducting in transit,

27:13.972 --> 27:15.390
how can he cover it up?

27:15.474 --> 27:18.576
I felt like we were close
with the charter idea.

27:18.644 --> 27:21.079
Maybe he doesn't abduct
them off a boat.

27:21.146 --> 27:22.647
The details of his ruse
were right.

27:22.714 --> 27:26.551
What means of transportation
doesn't issue a ticket in advance?

27:27.653 --> 27:28.920
Passenger trains.

27:28.987 --> 27:31.255
A conductor
can hand-write a ticket

27:31.323 --> 27:32.740
once you're already
on board.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.425
Actually, most of the smaller
stations aren't even manned.

27:34.493 --> 27:36.261
You have to buy tickets
on board.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.072
You know, the train is
a concept that attracts people

27:38.073 --> 27:39.183
who are trying to start over.

27:39.185 --> 27:41.053
The appeal of escape,
of romance.

27:41.112 --> 27:43.181
If he's a conductor,
he's in a target-rich environment.

27:43.602 --> 27:45.470
My men pulled a body
out of the water.

27:45.537 --> 27:48.072
Agent Morgan's
at the autopsy now.

27:50.175 --> 27:53.127
The wounds on the thigh
show hesitation marks.

27:53.212 --> 27:55.847
An unsub this experienced
wouldn't display that.

27:55.914 --> 27:57.482
I don't think the unsub did.

27:57.549 --> 28:00.051
The angle indicates
left-handed dominance.

28:00.102 --> 28:01.552
The file says this guy
was left-handed, too.

28:01.603 --> 28:03.054
You know, if he'd
been given trilamide,

28:03.105 --> 28:04.856
the unsub could have
forced him to cut himself.

28:04.923 --> 28:07.225
It makes sense for a sadist
with abandonment issues,

28:07.276 --> 28:08.826
but why didn't he
finish the job?

28:08.894 --> 28:10.728
The victim must have gotten
a chance to escape and took it.

28:10.796 --> 28:14.398
But how? The trilamide kept him
compliant enough to hurt himself.

28:14.466 --> 28:16.167
It overcame his
self-preservation instinct.

28:16.235 --> 28:18.069
Well, then another instinct
must have been stronger.

28:18.137 --> 28:19.971
Like what?
A protective one.

28:20.038 --> 28:21.906
This guy was mentally
and physically compromised,

28:21.974 --> 28:24.408
but he still went after the
unsub with everything he had.

28:24.443 --> 28:28.212
Who would he fight
that hard for?

28:28.280 --> 28:29.413
A child, Garcia.

28:29.481 --> 28:31.082
Search nationwide
missing persons reports

28:31.133 --> 28:33.000
for men traveling
with their kids.

28:33.085 --> 28:34.502
Am I looking for
a son or daughter?

28:34.586 --> 28:35.636
We don't know yet.

28:35.721 --> 28:38.256
No, no, I'm sorry, honey.
No dice.

28:38.323 --> 28:41.625
Hey, what if they're not
reported as missing yet?

28:41.626 --> 28:42.540
Yeah, of course not.

28:42.541 --> 28:44.184
When the unsub met them,
they were starting over.

28:44.813 --> 28:46.664
All right, baby girl,
new deal.

28:46.732 --> 28:48.833
USPS change of address
notices,

28:48.901 --> 28:51.402
people moving into Florida
and South Carolina.

28:51.469 --> 28:52.904
Done.

28:52.971 --> 28:54.105
All right, eliminate women,
wives, couples.

28:54.173 --> 28:55.306
Narrow it down
to men only.

28:55.357 --> 28:57.492
So we're thinking
divorced dad here, right?

28:57.576 --> 28:58.943
Yeah, but not
just any divorced dad.

28:58.994 --> 29:00.745
This guy wants
as much distance

29:00.812 --> 29:02.346
between his son
and his ex-wife as possible.

29:02.414 --> 29:05.216
So look for custody disputes,
injunctions, allegations.

29:05.284 --> 29:06.450
The messier the better, Garcia.

29:06.518 --> 29:08.419
I get you.
I'll call you right back.

29:33.445 --> 29:35.947
Take it.

29:46.491 --> 29:50.428
Go ahead.
Give it your best shot.

29:50.495 --> 29:54.332
Like your father did.

29:59.338 --> 30:00.504
Gut it.

30:02.507 --> 30:03.841
Gut it!

30:18.941 --> 30:20.942
I'm getting it now, baby girl.
That's our victim.

30:21.059 --> 30:24.161
My beautiful SSA Derek Morgan,
you deserve a raise.

30:24.229 --> 30:26.430
Gary Rhymer of Virginia
just got full custody

30:26.498 --> 30:28.616
after his wife failed
drug test number 3.

30:28.700 --> 30:29.967
Who's the child?

30:30.035 --> 30:31.869
His name is James.
He's 15.

30:31.902 --> 30:33.083
Enrolled to start school
next week

30:33.108 --> 30:34.608
in Mount Pleasant,
which is east of Charleston.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.340
Looks like Gary
has a sister there.

30:36.408 --> 30:37.608
How about
how they're traveling?

30:37.676 --> 30:39.743
No. Sorry, babe,
there's no record of that.

30:39.795 --> 30:41.479
Just like the others.

30:41.546 --> 30:42.980
Thanks, doll.

30:43.048 --> 30:45.349
None of the family members
could confirm a train line for us.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.551
So what do we do,
we just rule it out?

30:47.619 --> 30:49.186
No. There's one person
we haven't asked.

30:49.254 --> 30:50.221
Who?

30:50.289 --> 30:51.422
Your aunt.

30:54.610 --> 30:56.694
The train?

30:56.762 --> 30:58.145
Did she ever mention it?

30:58.230 --> 31:01.632
No. She never told us anything.
You said it was safer that way.

31:04.970 --> 31:08.239
You know, when your
Uncle Paul was still alive,

31:08.307 --> 31:10.641
he took the train
to Myrtle Beach.

31:10.709 --> 31:12.743
Really?
What was the line?

31:12.811 --> 31:15.446
Silver Star.

31:16.948 --> 31:18.749
Cindi visited him once.

31:18.817 --> 31:20.284
By train?

31:20.352 --> 31:21.552
Yes.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.688
Auntie, that's
a 36-hour-trip.

31:23.755 --> 31:24.855
How old was she?

31:24.923 --> 31:26.657
10.

31:29.177 --> 31:31.629
Sometimes we want
something so bad

31:31.697 --> 31:34.231
that our minds
will invent details.

31:34.299 --> 31:35.232
But--

31:35.300 --> 31:36.851
No, listen to me,
please.

31:36.935 --> 31:40.471
I want to find Cindi for you.
Believe me, I do.

31:40.539 --> 31:42.506
But right now he has
someone else's child,

31:42.574 --> 31:44.675
someone we can
still save.

31:44.743 --> 31:47.478
We can't afford
to be wrong.

31:48.947 --> 31:50.948
I'm sorry.

31:51.016 --> 31:52.717
I was just trying
to help.

31:52.784 --> 31:55.619
I know. I know.
That's ok.

31:55.687 --> 31:57.621
Try to remember.

31:57.689 --> 31:59.757
Did she visit him?

32:03.095 --> 32:05.396
Yes.

32:05.464 --> 32:07.898
But she flew.

32:07.966 --> 32:11.936
And I remember all the
paperwork I had to fill out.

32:12.003 --> 32:14.839
She was an
unaccompanied minor.

32:26.651 --> 32:28.452
James took the train
3 summers in a row

32:28.520 --> 32:29.653
during his parents' divorce.

32:29.721 --> 32:31.288
His aunt from South Carolina
bought the tickets,

32:31.356 --> 32:33.324
filled out the unaccompanied
minor paperwork,

32:33.392 --> 32:35.459
which is why it didn't
show up in my search.

32:35.527 --> 32:36.794
What's the train line?

32:36.861 --> 32:39.213
Surf Rider. It makes stops
in Jacksonville,

32:39.331 --> 32:40.431
Charleston, and Miami.

32:40.499 --> 32:42.266
Cross-reference
your list of boat owners

32:42.334 --> 32:44.635
with railroad employees.

32:44.702 --> 32:45.736
I got a hit on a last name.

32:45.804 --> 32:47.905
Chuck Wells, local fisherman,

32:47.973 --> 32:50.841
son Blake,
conductor on the line.

32:50.909 --> 32:53.077
And there it is. He didn't show
up for work this week.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.278
Is there
a current address?

32:54.346 --> 32:56.947
No. Only a boat
in the dad's name,

32:57.015 --> 32:58.449
which moved to Norfolk
in 2000

32:58.517 --> 33:00.851
when the mom was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

33:00.919 --> 33:02.186
She died a few months later.

33:02.254 --> 33:04.422
Dad walked out and the unsub
had to punish him for that.

33:04.489 --> 33:05.990
James doesn't fit
the victimology.

33:06.057 --> 33:07.525
It doesn't make sense the unsub
would take him.

33:07.576 --> 33:08.993
He picked up on
a father-son relationship

33:09.060 --> 33:10.361
that reminded him
of his own.

33:10.429 --> 33:11.595
What he didn't count on

33:11.663 --> 33:13.964
was Gary fighting
for James' life.

33:14.032 --> 33:16.751
How do we know the unsub
hasn't already killed James?

33:16.835 --> 33:18.252
So far he's only
punished people

33:18.336 --> 33:20.304
who've abandoned
their responsibilities.

33:20.372 --> 33:23.107
But that's exactly what James
is to him now, a responsibility.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.426
The unsub's gonna get
angrier and angrier at that kid,

33:25.510 --> 33:27.678
and when he does, he's gonna
become more like his father.

33:35.687 --> 33:39.723
I was just about your age
when I started working here.

33:39.775 --> 33:42.893
14 hours a day, every day.

33:42.944 --> 33:46.280
That son of a bitch
said I had to earn my keep.

33:46.364 --> 33:49.900
And then he'd beat me,
he'd take my paycheck,

33:49.968 --> 33:52.236
and he'd drink it away!

34:05.217 --> 34:06.784
Get up.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.418
Garcia narrowed
the unsub's history

34:15.485 --> 34:16.920
with his dad
down to two locations.

34:17.966 --> 34:20.417
Seaside pier, which is where
Chuck Wells used to dock his boat.

34:20.485 --> 34:23.587
All the locals do.
It's the cheapest spot to tie off.

34:23.655 --> 34:25.422
She also mentioned a cannery
on St. John's River.

34:25.489 --> 34:27.591
That place went out
of business last year.

34:27.659 --> 34:28.926
It's abandoned.

34:28.994 --> 34:30.226
The dad brought
his catch there

34:30.295 --> 34:32.062
while the unsub worked the floor.
Started at 16,

34:32.130 --> 34:34.031
which is roughly
the same age as James.

34:34.099 --> 34:35.996
All right, we'll split up.
Morgan, you take one SWAT team

34:35.996 --> 34:36.779
and go to the cannery.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.179
Detective Foreman and I
will take the other

34:38.235 --> 34:39.737
and we'll go to the docks.

34:39.804 --> 34:42.706
We can be in both locations
in 5 minutes.

34:50.614 --> 34:54.351
One day I was late for work
and my dad broke my arm.

34:54.418 --> 34:56.337
And he told me
to keep gutting.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.323
And I cut and I cut

34:59.391 --> 35:01.992
till I passed out.

35:09.834 --> 35:11.635
Now gut the fish.

35:36.161 --> 35:38.128
Yeah.

35:38.196 --> 35:40.431
Morgan, he's not here.
I think you've got him.

35:40.498 --> 35:42.466
I see the boat, Hotch.

35:42.533 --> 35:43.533
Let's go.

35:46.004 --> 35:48.389
No, I won't do it.

35:50.175 --> 35:51.892
Pick up the knife.

35:51.977 --> 35:53.093
Or what?

35:53.178 --> 35:55.179
You gonna break my arm?

35:56.881 --> 35:58.232
No.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.451
I'm gonna
slice your throat.

36:00.519 --> 36:02.537
Blake! FBI!

36:02.621 --> 36:05.490
Stand down! Stand down!
Do not shoot!

36:05.541 --> 36:06.874
Everybody stand down.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.042
Drop it.

36:08.127 --> 36:09.127
Drop the knife.

36:09.194 --> 36:10.578
Stand back.
Stand back!

36:10.662 --> 36:11.796
Ok. Ok.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.922
I'm gonna put this away,
all right?

36:14.948 --> 36:17.082
I just want to talk to you.

36:18.585 --> 36:20.219
Come on, man.

36:20.287 --> 36:22.888
Look at James.
He's just a kid.

36:22.956 --> 36:25.674
Blake, you don't hurt kids.
You're not that guy.

36:25.759 --> 36:27.810
You have no idea
who I am.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.396
I know that
you're a smart man.

36:30.463 --> 36:32.515
You had a long run
at killing under the radar.

36:32.599 --> 36:36.435
But I also know that we can lear
a lot from a man like you.

36:36.486 --> 36:39.355
See, studying men like you
is my responsibility.

36:39.439 --> 36:42.007
And I'm telling you,
if you let James go,

36:42.075 --> 36:44.343
we can be
a part of your life.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.846
We won't abandon you, Blake.

36:49.850 --> 36:52.751
What makes you think
I want to teach you?

36:52.819 --> 36:54.420
Look at your alternative, man.

36:56.623 --> 36:57.823
My guys are ready.

36:57.891 --> 37:01.393
They will take the shot
and they will kill you.

37:01.461 --> 37:03.729
What happens
after that, Blake?

37:03.797 --> 37:07.466
Do you really think you're gonna
get to see your mom again?

37:07.517 --> 37:10.736
Or maybe it'll just
be cold...

37:10.804 --> 37:14.540
Dark, empty.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.942
Like the water
where you put your dad.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.813
It's your choice, man.

37:35.328 --> 37:37.162
Get him out of here.

37:38.999 --> 37:40.866
Take him.

37:58.885 --> 38:01.921
All right, Blake,
here's how it works.

38:01.988 --> 38:06.258
We verify every word you say
against forensics and records.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.694
You lie to me, deal's off.

38:08.762 --> 38:11.130
What do you want to know?

38:11.197 --> 38:15.234
Let's start with how you
abducted these victims.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.008
Carol Reed.

38:24.644 --> 38:26.979
Oh, I could smell
the fear on her.

38:27.047 --> 38:31.283
Oh, she promised me
she would do anything

38:31.351 --> 38:32.985
if I let her live.

38:33.053 --> 38:35.788
Your method of abduction?

38:35.855 --> 38:37.856
She was easy.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.459
She was a meth addict.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.728
I just told her
I was holding.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.703
Alton McKee.

38:50.770 --> 38:53.172
I caught him off guard.

38:53.239 --> 38:57.609
He was running away
from his nagging wife.

38:58.945 --> 39:02.214
He couldn't stop
calling her a bitch.

39:02.282 --> 39:04.083
You're really enjoying
yourself, aren't you?

39:05.585 --> 39:06.986
You making up
for your loss?

39:12.559 --> 39:14.927
What loss is that?

39:14.995 --> 39:16.395
Well, it must have really
gotten under your skin

39:16.463 --> 39:19.164
that they stumbled onto your
perfect little hiding place.

39:19.232 --> 39:22.468
Not really.

39:22.535 --> 39:25.738
How do you know I don't have
a dozen more just like it?

39:25.805 --> 39:27.239
It's a big sea.

39:27.307 --> 39:28.774
No.

39:28.842 --> 39:32.011
Blake, it's the same place where
you dumped your own father.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.278
He was the most
important one,

39:33.346 --> 39:35.681
so you had to come back here
and dump the other bodies.

39:47.293 --> 39:50.129
I didn't dump her there,
did I?

39:55.602 --> 39:57.102
She means something
to you, doesn't she?

39:57.170 --> 39:59.938
They're all special
to me, Blake.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.975
If you can't remember her,
we can just move on.

40:03.043 --> 40:04.977
I do remember her.

40:05.045 --> 40:07.780
You want to know,
Agent Morgan,

40:07.847 --> 40:11.950
who she cried out for right before
I made her slice her own throat?

40:12.018 --> 40:13.485
Go ahead.

40:13.553 --> 40:14.853
Tell me.

40:16.222 --> 40:17.656
You.

40:17.724 --> 40:20.993
She cried out for you.

40:21.061 --> 40:23.328
Where were you...

40:23.396 --> 40:26.799
When she bled out
on the floor of my boat?

40:30.403 --> 40:33.672
You are a sick
son of a bitch.

40:33.740 --> 40:35.541
But you didn't kill her.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.014
I did kill her.

40:42.082 --> 40:43.615
No.

40:43.683 --> 40:45.184
You didn't.

40:45.251 --> 40:47.920
And I was very clear
about the rules.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.107
- Deal's off.
- I did kill her.

40:52.192 --> 40:54.576
You said you wanted
to learn from me,

40:54.661 --> 40:55.861
and now you won't listen!

40:55.929 --> 40:57.413
Hey, come back here!

40:57.497 --> 40:59.948
Agent Morgan!

41:00.033 --> 41:01.467
I did kill her!

41:01.534 --> 41:03.135
How did you know?

41:03.203 --> 41:05.871
He knows his victims' names.

41:05.939 --> 41:07.873
He didn't know Cindi's.

41:07.941 --> 41:10.242
Agent Morgan,
you get back here!

41:12.378 --> 41:14.746
Agent Morgan!

41:31.898 --> 41:33.832
Did you find her?

41:33.900 --> 41:36.201
No, auntie.

41:38.371 --> 41:41.807
I'm never gonna know,
am I?

41:45.912 --> 41:47.913
He picked out her picture.

41:49.749 --> 41:52.518
He did?

41:57.640 --> 42:00.476
Thank you.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.961
Thank you.

42:08.101 --> 42:10.802
Thank you.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.775
"We are tied
to the ocean,

42:16.826 --> 42:19.194
"and when we go back
to the sea,

42:19.279 --> 42:21.813
"whether it is to sail
or to watch,

42:21.881 --> 42:24.750
we are going back
from whence we came."

42:24.817 --> 42:26.618
John F. Kennedy.
