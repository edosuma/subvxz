00:00.033 --> 00:02.832
- Look at that, heh, nice.

00:03.033 --> 00:04.832
- I love cycling.

00:05.090 --> 00:06.532
Andy, I feel like a tourist in
my own city.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.002
I literally can't wait to wake up
every morning.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.832
- Ok.
- She is a beauty.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.832
- Can't beat a horse.
A horse is a bike that pedals itself.

00:13.567 --> 00:15.168
- Oh, look at that, smooth roll.
-Yeah

00:15.206 --> 00:18.336
- You got it!
Lance Armstrong's bike.

00:18.404 --> 00:20.105
- Yes!
- His ass was on that seat?

00:20.172 --> 00:21.606
- All right!
- Nice.

00:21.674 --> 00:23.333
- No, Mary,
that's not his actual bicycle.

00:23.401 --> 00:26.316
But it is the same
exact model he uses.

00:26.384 --> 00:28.251
- I'm on Sheryl Crow's side
in that whole thing,

00:28.319 --> 00:30.017
So I feel really weird
right now.

00:30.084 --> 00:32.180
- Michael!
- Oh.

00:32.244 --> 00:34.842
Yes, I can ride a bike.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.540
I take spinning classes
three times a month.

00:37.608 --> 00:39.472
I think I know
how to ride a bike.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.340
- Are you sure you once
knew how to do this?

00:41.408 --> 00:42.409
- I did, yes!

00:42.477 --> 00:44.576
I had those extra wheels
on the back

00:44.644 --> 00:46.143
That support you.

00:52.814 --> 00:54.917
- Yeah!
- Just steer more now.

00:54.985 --> 00:57.416
- Oh, my--
- not the car!

00:57.484 --> 00:59.251

He's kind of like...

Scranton Steve Nash.

01:51.690 --> 01:52.690
- Will you stop
trying to put it in terms

01:52.757 --> 01:53.990
You think
they'll understand?

01:54.058 --> 01:55.258
It's condescending.
- I'm not doing that.

01:55.325 --> 01:56.826
I'm just explaining.

01:56.893 --> 01:59.327
- And who is this
"the" Steve Nash?

01:59.395 --> 02:01.262

02:01.329 --> 02:02.963

- No? Nothin'?

02:03.031 --> 02:04.764
- No, Mr. Jock Hipster.

02:04.831 --> 02:06.264
- Well, I'm neither
of those things, so...

02:09.033 --> 02:09.967

Oh, my god!
- What? Is Dan okay?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.880
- No, he died.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.281
It's Broccoli Rob.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.582
You know this guy.

02:30.649 --> 02:32.383
I showed you his picture

It's great.

02:52.568 --> 02:53.668
- You know,
I forget about milk.

02:53.735 --> 02:55.735
This is a terrific reminder.

02:59.037 --> 03:02.201
- I was the artsy
musical one.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.969
And here comes trouble.
I had four solos.

03:04.037 --> 03:05.637
Broccoli Rob had three.

Danny Cordray is the worst.

03:27.521 --> 03:28.987
- Well, by worst,
you mean the best.

03:29.055 --> 03:30.689
- The best salesman ever.

03:30.756 --> 03:32.456
He works for Osprey paper
over in Throop,

03:32.524 --> 03:34.791
Steals more clients from
dunder-mifflin than anyone.

03:34.859 --> 03:36.292
- So the situation
is the worst.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.593
- Also, he slept with pam.

03:37.661 --> 03:39.695
- No, he didn't.

03:42.531 --> 03:43.498
- Tell 'em.

03:43.565 --> 03:45.299
- Nothing happened.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.000
We went on a couple of dates.

03:47.068 --> 03:48.435
He never called me again.

03:48.502 --> 03:50.002
- What?
He never called <i>you?</i>

03:50.070 --> 03:51.037
I thought you said
it just fizzled.

03:51.104 --> 03:52.204
- That's fizzling.

03:52.272 --> 03:54.005
I mean, someone has
to start the fizzle.

03:54.073 --> 03:55.006
- Yeah, I thought
you started it.

03:55.074 --> 03:56.908
- No, I liked him.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.009
For a couple of days.

03:59.077 --> 04:00.677
Four years ago.

04:02.413 --> 04:04.313
You know I have a kid
with you, right?

04:04.381 --> 04:05.514
- Ah.

04:08.450 --> 04:09.717
- I'm gonna intimidate him.

04:09.785 --> 04:10.951
Okay?
- Okay, great.

04:11.019 --> 04:12.953
I'm just gonna watch.
- Watch this.

04:13.021 --> 04:15.121
So anyway, she says,
"that is the biggest penis

04:15.189 --> 04:17.156

and I said, "I know.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.458
"that's why I brought you
to the penis museum,

04:19.524 --> 04:21.492

04:26.431 --> 04:28.631
Good to see you too.

04:28.699 --> 04:30.133
- Oh, I'm just here

04:30.200 --> 04:32.368
- Oh, like hell you are.
- Dwight!

04:32.436 --> 04:34.469
- He's not just here
for the coffee, Jim.

04:34.537 --> 04:36.037
Wake up.

04:36.105 --> 04:38.039
- Brainstorming session
is now open.

04:38.106 --> 04:40.207
Anyone has an idea.

04:40.275 --> 04:41.541
hold...On.

04:41.609 --> 04:43.009
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:43.077 --> 04:44.077
Hello?

04:44.144 --> 04:45.511
- Hey, it's Jim.

04:45.579 --> 04:47.212
Listen, this is important.
Are you busy?

04:47.280 --> 04:48.313
- Oh, hey.
No, I'm not busy.

04:48.381 --> 04:49.581
What's up?
- You are busy!

04:49.649 --> 04:50.682
We're in a meeting!

04:50.750 --> 04:52.917
- It's Jim, okay?
Yes.

04:52.984 --> 04:54.151
- Listen, you gotta
get over here,

04:54.218 --> 04:55.452
'cause we're
pitching Steve Nash

04:55.486 --> 04:56.653
And Danny Cordray's here.

04:56.721 --> 04:58.654
- You need the big guns, yes?

04:58.722 --> 04:59.822
- Yes.
- What'd he say?

04:59.890 --> 05:02.023
What did he say?
- The big gun thing. Stop.

05:02.091 --> 05:04.458
- I will see you in ten.
Bye! Hold tight.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.262
Well, I know a lot of you
thought that my sales days

05:09.329 --> 05:10.529
Were behind me.

05:10.597 --> 05:12.097
And, to be honest,
so did I.

05:12.164 --> 05:14.699
And the only reason
I got out of the sales game

05:14.766 --> 05:16.467
Was to be reluctantly
called back in.

05:16.534 --> 05:18.068
- You don't look reluctant,
Michael.

05:18.136 --> 05:19.269
You look really eager.

05:19.337 --> 05:21.937
- no, I don't have time for this.

05:22.005 --> 05:23.439
Are you kidding me?
- You don't?

05:23.507 --> 05:25.407
- No! Okay.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.677

don't knock back ♪

05:29.744 --> 05:31.979

It's your office.

05:32.046 --> 05:33.214
Do you have a minute?

05:33.282 --> 05:36.984

with time-sensitive work.

05:37.052 --> 05:38.685
- Not to go all
Sherlock Holmes on you,

05:38.753 --> 05:40.186

the reflection in your glasses

05:40.254 --> 05:42.855

into weightwatchers.com.

05:42.923 --> 05:44.790

immediately,

05:44.858 --> 05:46.225
You forget.

05:46.292 --> 05:47.626
What?

05:47.694 --> 05:51.095
- I'm starting a band,
and I need you on keyboards.

05:51.163 --> 05:52.363
- Nah.

05:52.431 --> 05:53.697
I play for pleasure.

05:53.765 --> 05:55.132
- This is for pleasure.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.900
- Wouldn't enjoy that.

05:56.968 --> 05:58.135
- I'm willing  pay you.

05:58.202 --> 05:59.736
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:59.804 --> 06:01.704
- How much?
- 60 bucks a session.

06:01.772 --> 06:03.239
- That's crazy money.

06:03.306 --> 06:04.240
I'll take 40.

06:04.307 --> 06:05.507
- Yes!

06:06.609 --> 06:07.709
- There he is.

06:09.511 --> 06:10.945
- Oh, no,
that's a male model.

06:11.013 --> 06:12.245
- No, that's him.

06:12.313 --> 06:14.247
- That...

06:14.315 --> 06:16.749
Hello.

06:16.817 --> 06:18.618
Michael Scott,
Dunder-Mifflin paper company.

06:18.686 --> 06:20.953
- Danny Cordray, Osprey paper.
- Nice to meet you.

06:21.021 --> 06:22.788
- Three of you guys
for one sale?

06:22.855 --> 06:24.122
- Yeah, well...

06:24.190 --> 06:25.390
We call it overkill.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.259
Why am I telling you
my strategy?

06:27.326 --> 06:29.494
- Well, whatever
works for you.

06:29.562 --> 06:30.762
Anyway, all right.

06:30.829 --> 06:31.829
- All right.
- Good to see you guys.

06:31.897 --> 06:33.364
Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.866
I could swear that guy
was a male model.

06:35.934 --> 06:36.867
- He's ready for you.

06:36.934 --> 06:38.501
- Oh, thank you.
All right.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.003
On the count of three,
it's showtime.

06:40.071 --> 06:41.871
Ready, one, two--
- no, I'm not doing that.

06:41.939 --> 06:43.405
- I've been in showtime mode
since breakfast.

06:43.473 --> 06:45.040
- All right,
just forget it then.

06:45.107 --> 06:46.040
- Showtime!
- It's showtime!

06:46.108 --> 06:48.909
Oh...Never mind.
Let's go.

06:48.977 --> 06:51.077
When I knock on your door,
you know who it is.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.511
It's Michael Scott.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.246
We've been together forever,
and--

06:54.314 --> 06:56.950
- Michael, I appreciate
everything that Dunder-Mifflin

06:57.018 --> 06:58.719
Has done for this company.
- You know what?

06:58.787 --> 07:02.190
You are hang some problems
with your loading dock.

07:02.258 --> 07:03.758
Are you not?
All right.

07:03.826 --> 07:05.560
We're going to deliver to you
on weekends.

07:05.628 --> 07:07.562
- That's very generous
but--

07:07.630 --> 07:09.163
- And you know what else
we're gonna do?

07:09.231 --> 07:10.831
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

07:10.899 --> 07:12.899
We are going to offer you
our paper at cost.

07:12.967 --> 07:14.400
I know.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.102
I could get in a lotta
trouble for this,

07:16.170 --> 07:17.670
So you'd better shake
my hand right now.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.105
- He's not kidding.
- Shake it, shake it!

07:19.173 --> 07:20.473
- Michael,
I'm going with Danny.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.107
- Oh.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.275
- Thanks for coming in.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.344
- Okay.
Thank you.

07:27.579 --> 07:29.814
- Jim talked too much.
- No, I didn't.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.148
- Yes, you did.
- Stop it.

07:31.215 --> 07:32.916
Just stop it.
We did what we should have done.

07:32.984 --> 07:34.985
We just got bested.

07:36.521 --> 07:37.854
Why is there
a door close button

07:37.922 --> 07:41.090
If it doesn't even
close the door?

07:41.158 --> 07:43.426
How do I feel about
losing the sale?

07:43.494 --> 07:47.163
It's like if Michael Phelps
came out of retirement,

07:47.230 --> 07:51.066
Jumped in the pool,
belly-flopped, and drowned.

07:51.134 --> 07:52.901
You know who we always
lose out to?

07:52.968 --> 07:56.137
Staples, the big guys.

07:56.204 --> 07:58.305
Osprey?
They're a small company.

07:58.373 --> 07:59.606
They're smaller than we are.

07:59.674 --> 08:02.575
What's our excuse?
How do we combat this guy?

08:02.643 --> 08:04.143
Stanley,
how do we combat him?

08:04.211 --> 08:05.244
- We sell better?

08:05.312 --> 08:06.846
- Okay. You know what?

08:06.914 --> 08:10.015
You clearly don't care,
so why don't you just leave?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.284
- I would like to stay.
This pertains to me.

08:12.352 --> 08:15.019
- Why don't you go outside
and...take a shot of insulin

08:15.087 --> 08:16.586
And have a nap, okay?

08:16.654 --> 08:18.588
- Why do you always assume
I have diabetes?

08:18.656 --> 08:20.189
- I don't know.
Your frame, your build.

08:20.257 --> 08:21.991
Why don't you have a glass
of apple juice

08:22.059 --> 08:23.259
And tell me
you're not a diabetic.

08:24.761 --> 08:26.862
- See? I could tell by the sound
you made when you stood up

08:26.930 --> 08:28.764
That you have--okay.
Yes, Phyllis?

08:28.831 --> 08:30.265
- I could try to seduce him.

08:30.332 --> 08:31.699
- Oh, my god!

08:31.767 --> 08:34.335
- I know how we can
learn his tricks.

08:34.403 --> 08:38.206
What I'm about to show you
is of the utmost secrecy.

08:38.274 --> 08:40.674
- Is that your office?
- Yes, Jim.

08:40.743 --> 08:43.010
And with a little tweaky,
it becomes a different office.

08:43.078 --> 08:45.713
We lure Danny to it
and watch him sell.

08:45.781 --> 08:47.614
- Ehh...
- I'm outta here.

08:47.682 --> 08:49.616
- This is weird.
- You know what this is?

08:49.684 --> 08:51.318
This is a stinger.
- A what?

08:51.385 --> 08:54.587
- Like the movie.
- Oh, you mean <i>The Sting.</i>

08:54.655 --> 08:57.056
- Paul Newman, Robert Redford.
They're bank robbers?

08:57.124 --> 09:00.192
- Nope. Different movie.
- <i>The Sting. The Sting.</i>

09:04.927 --> 09:06.727
- Your 2:00.

09:06.795 --> 09:07.895
- Thanks, hon.

09:07.962 --> 09:09.563
- Meredith
was the perfect choice

09:09.631 --> 09:11.898
To play the head
of the company.

09:11.966 --> 09:14.300
Her lunch break lined up
with our appointment with Danny

09:14.368 --> 09:16.869
And...That's it.

09:16.936 --> 09:18.937
That's really
all we were looking for.

09:19.005 --> 09:20.505
- Danny Cordray.
It's great to meet you.

09:20.573 --> 09:22.107
- Meredith Van Helsing.
Pleased to meet you.

09:22.175 --> 09:23.742
- Meredith Van Helsing?

09:23.809 --> 09:25.310
- Van Helsing
was a respected professor

09:25.377 --> 09:27.245
Before he was
a vampire killer.

09:27.313 --> 09:28.947
- Okay. But what is he
more famous for?

09:29.014 --> 09:30.114
- Shh!

09:30.182 --> 09:32.183
Hey! That's my mug.

09:32.251 --> 09:34.018
- You know this isn't
real TV, right?

09:34.086 --> 09:35.886
- Yes.

09:35.954 --> 09:39.090
♪ please, Mr. President ♪

09:39.191 --> 09:42.294
♪ if you wanna
give hope a whirl ♪

09:42.361 --> 09:44.863
♪ bring our troops home

09:44.930 --> 09:48.099

09:48.166 --> 09:50.834
- ♪ please, Mr. President ♪

09:50.902 --> 09:52.235
- One second, one second,
one second.

09:52.303 --> 09:55.772
So...The song is from the point
of view of a little girl.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.407
- Yeah.
- But you're singing it.

09:57.474 --> 09:58.975
- Yeah. But I'm using
my falsetto.

09:59.042 --> 10:01.744
- No, that's not a good idea.
It's not a very good song.

10:01.812 --> 10:03.345
- Yeah, well,
it'd sound a lot better

10:03.413 --> 10:05.413
If you actually
sang with some soul.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.482
- Oh, I never sing with soul.
- That's a lie.

10:07.550 --> 10:09.917
- I could sing it.
- I just was hoping maybe

10:09.985 --> 10:11.352
You'd save your voice

10:11.419 --> 10:13.086
In case we did a novelty
song about frogs.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.422
- But my voice is unique.
Like Bob Dylan.

10:16.489 --> 10:17.656
- Okay, three-way argument

10:17.724 --> 10:19.524
Between a drummer,
a keyboardist,

10:19.592 --> 10:21.359
And the front man
lead singer.

10:21.427 --> 10:24.029
Wonder who's gonna
win this one.

10:24.096 --> 10:26.431
Two, three, four--

10:26.499 --> 10:28.433
- I'm gonna take off my coat,
if you don't mind.

10:28.501 --> 10:31.202
It's a bit warm in here.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.104
- Hel...lo!

10:34.171 --> 10:35.838
- Oh, no, no, no.
Don't...

10:35.906 --> 10:38.340
- People can't keep their
true natures hidden for long,

10:38.408 --> 10:40.475
And this guy is smoldering
like a tire fire.

10:40.543 --> 10:42.209
- Testify.
- He's not that good-looking.

10:42.277 --> 10:43.744
I don't understand why
everybody's--

10:43.812 --> 10:45.213
- Yeah, he is that
good-looking.

10:45.281 --> 10:46.615
- He's very, very handsome.
- Okay.

10:46.683 --> 10:48.550
- That's a great set
of shoulders you got there.

10:48.618 --> 10:51.353
What is that, genetics?

10:51.421 --> 10:52.388
Creatine?

10:53.523 --> 10:54.723
Sorry.

10:54.791 --> 10:56.959
Yeah.
- Pull it together, all right?

10:57.027 --> 10:59.094
Stop lookin' at him.

10:59.162 --> 11:00.928
- I'm sorry.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.630
You're here
to sell me some paper.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.400
- Well, actually, uh...
No, miss Van Helsing.

11:07.468 --> 11:08.735
that's not why I'm here.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.236
I'm here to meet you,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.704
See if we'd be a, you know,
good fit.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.706
- What do you mean?
- Oh, my God!

11:14.773 --> 11:17.641
He's making her sell to him.

11:17.709 --> 11:19.276
♪ bring our troops home ♪

11:19.344 --> 11:20.844
♪ safe and sound ♪

11:20.912 --> 11:22.845
♪ says this little girl ♪

11:22.913 --> 11:24.646
- Okay. Honest feedback time.

11:24.714 --> 11:25.881
Oscar.

11:25.948 --> 11:27.183
- That's pandering.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.285
And it makes me think
you think I'm stupid.

11:29.352 --> 11:31.220
- But do you think
it could be famous?

11:31.287 --> 11:32.855
Like in a car commercial
or something?

11:32.922 --> 11:34.022
- Not really.

11:34.090 --> 11:35.857
It's kinda weird
that a grown man

11:35.925 --> 11:38.693
Is singing from the point
of view of a little girl.

11:38.761 --> 11:41.295
- I feel like I can see
someone ice skating to it.

11:41.363 --> 11:43.363
You know,
like in the olympics.

11:43.431 --> 11:45.031
- I-I don't think
they usually...

11:45.099 --> 11:47.967
Skate to such...
bad songs.

11:48.034 --> 11:50.435
- Rude.
And not helpful.

11:50.503 --> 11:52.871
- Well, I really,
really, really liked it.

11:52.939 --> 11:55.641
- Well, that,
really bums me out.

11:55.708 --> 11:58.077
- You're welcome.

11:58.144 --> 11:59.711
- We should think of this
as a first date.

11:59.779 --> 12:01.278
- and I think it's going

12:01.346 --> 12:03.212
Very well.
How 'bout you?

12:03.280 --> 12:05.680
- Real well.
Uh...

12:05.748 --> 12:07.748
Feels more like
a third date to me.

12:07.816 --> 12:09.083
- Ha ha.
There you go!

12:11.119 --> 12:13.419
- Stay--
- shut up and let me do this!

12:13.487 --> 12:15.421
You know,

12:15.488 --> 12:18.590
What is with this desk
keeping us so far apart?

12:18.657 --> 12:20.157
- I've never been a desk man.

12:20.225 --> 12:24.094
Always traveling on the road.
Come on, why not, huh?

12:24.129 --> 12:26.296
- Oh...
- Well, we'll get this...

12:28.699 --> 12:30.232
- Oh...
- Oh, man.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.400
- So...What's your drink?

12:31.467 --> 12:34.302
You a vodka man?
Me too.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.337
- We gotta get someone else
in there rightow.

12:36.405 --> 12:38.305
You're an exec
at pennsylvania solartech.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.740
- That sounds fake.
- What do you mean?

12:39.808 --> 12:40.941
- I told you.

12:41.009 --> 12:42.342
You're an exec
at Stark industries,

12:42.410 --> 12:44.177
A corporation
you inherited from your father.

12:44.245 --> 12:45.378
- Stop it.
Here's the story.

12:45.446 --> 12:47.313
They need Meredith somewhere
else ASAP, okay?

12:47.381 --> 12:48.648
So you're taking over.

12:48.715 --> 12:50.682
You just gotta get her
out of there as soon as you can.

12:50.750 --> 12:51.850
- I can do that.
Then what?

12:51.917 --> 12:53.185
- Then make him
pitch to you.

12:53.253 --> 12:54.653
You gotta see what he's got.
- Exactly.

12:54.721 --> 12:56.622
- Okay, and remember.
You're not gay.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.191
- Stop it.
It's gonna be great.

12:58.258 --> 13:01.261
And listen, if anything else
happens, just... roll with it.

13:03.497 --> 13:05.330
- Meredith, I--
- oh, Manuel.

13:05.398 --> 13:07.732
This is Manuel,
my cleaning man.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.167
He doesn't speak
any English.

13:09.235 --> 13:11.436
- <i>Hola. ¿que tal?</i>

13:11.503 --> 13:13.371
- <i>¿como estas?</i>

13:13.438 --> 13:16.807
- Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.976
- Who else we got?

13:20.444 --> 13:24.179
- Okay. You're a young hotshot
from Stark industries.

13:24.247 --> 13:26.348
You've just bought this company.
Meredith is fired.

13:26.416 --> 13:28.850
It's a whole new regime.
He's gotta pitch to you now.

13:28.918 --> 13:30.818
- Okay. Stark industries
isn't real.

13:30.886 --> 13:32.920
I run google.
Larry and Sergey brought me--

13:32.988 --> 13:34.955
- That sounds awesome.
Just have him pitch to you.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.424
- Don't let us down.
- Will do. Won't do.

13:37.491 --> 13:40.259
- Yeah, sure.
- You smell like a Scorpio.

13:40.326 --> 13:43.528
- This is Esteban,
another cleaning man.

13:43.596 --> 13:45.564
He doesn't speak English
either.

13:45.631 --> 13:48.066
Esteban, el flooro.

13:54.105 --> 13:55.872
- You know what?

13:55.940 --> 13:57.540
I may have parked my car
in a compact space,

13:57.608 --> 13:59.208
And I hate when I see
others do that, so--

13:59.275 --> 14:01.209
- Danny, I feel
a real connection to you,

14:01.277 --> 14:02.777
And I gotta get real.

14:02.845 --> 14:04.178
- No. No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no!

14:04.246 --> 14:05.713
I'm goin' in!
- Michael!

14:05.780 --> 14:07.314
No, Michael, stop it!
No!

14:07.381 --> 14:09.049
- Stop, stop!
Oh, my God!

14:09.116 --> 14:11.484
Okay. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.

14:11.552 --> 14:12.985
Gross!
Stop it, please.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.588
Everybody stop.
- Michael Scott.

14:15.656 --> 14:17.056
- I said stop.

14:18.832 --> 14:19.898
- Okay, Danny...

14:19.966 --> 14:21.233
This is not
Pennsylvania Solartech.

14:21.301 --> 14:23.635
This is Dunder-Mifflin
paper company.

14:23.703 --> 14:25.470
This is Meredith Palmer.
- Pleased to meet you.

14:25.537 --> 14:27.370
- Don't--stay away from him,
please just leave.

14:27.438 --> 14:29.105
Get out of here.
Go. Forever.

14:29.173 --> 14:32.140
- Hmm.
- I owe you...

14:32.207 --> 14:33.641
A most sincere
and humble apology.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.042
We were trying to watch you
to see your sales technique

14:36.110 --> 14:38.744
So we could stop losing
so many clients to you.

14:38.811 --> 14:39.911
- But from where?

14:39.979 --> 14:41.912
- A surveillance room
next to this one.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.813
- Okay, so you...
Set up this fake company,

14:44.881 --> 14:46.715
Then you hired
this homeless woman

14:46.783 --> 14:49.950
To impersonate an executive
to spy on me

14:50.018 --> 14:51.989
So that you could copy
my sales technique.

14:52.056 --> 14:54.058
- Yes. And it's the sincerest
form of flattery.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.726
- Or...Crazy.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.060
- Well--
- I'm gonna go.

14:57.128 --> 14:59.295
- Okay. You know what,
it wasn't just me.

14:59.396 --> 15:01.631
Jim and Dwight
are behind that wall

15:01.698 --> 15:04.333
In the surveillance room,
and  was their plan as well.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.801
- no!!
- No, no, no, no.

15:05.868 --> 15:07.101
- Oh, well, then, yeah.
All right, hey!

15:07.169 --> 15:09.403
Good luck, guys!

15:09.470 --> 15:11.571
Seems like you got
a great operation here.

15:11.638 --> 15:13.139
- No, we don't.
Here's...Here's my point.

15:13.206 --> 15:16.076
Danny, listen,
you have to understand

15:16.144 --> 15:18.345
That we are not normally
like this.

15:18.412 --> 15:20.246
We just--we wanted to know
your tricks.

15:20.314 --> 15:22.314
- What do you mean, tricks?
There's no tricks, man.

15:22.382 --> 15:24.083
I'm just a good salesman.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.684
You wanna copy that?
You can't copy that!

15:25.751 --> 15:26.918
- You are, you are.
You are!

15:26.986 --> 15:28.119
Stop it, stop it.

15:28.187 --> 15:30.321
Stop.
You are a good salesman.

15:30.389 --> 15:33.191
And because of that...

15:33.259 --> 15:35.193
I want you to work for me.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.127
- Sure. You seem like
a fun, professional guy.

15:37.195 --> 15:38.428
- So you will.
- No!

15:38.496 --> 15:40.096
- Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold on.

15:40.164 --> 15:43.332
Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.766
Danny, I want you
to look at me.

15:46.035 --> 15:48.069
Do you want your life
to be better

15:48.137 --> 15:50.204
Or to be worse
or to stay the same?

15:50.271 --> 15:51.939
- Get out of my way.
- Answer the question.

15:52.006 --> 15:53.473
Do you want
a better life, Danny?

15:53.541 --> 15:56.443
- I swear to God,
I'm gonna hit you.

15:56.511 --> 15:58.012
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.

15:58.079 --> 16:00.180
I'm not--it's just
I'm very upset right now.

16:00.248 --> 16:01.782
I'm very upset!
- I know, I know.

16:01.850 --> 16:03.684
Do you want more freedom,
less freedom,

16:03.751 --> 16:05.252
or to stay the same?

16:05.319 --> 16:06.920
More freedom.

16:06.988 --> 16:08.921
- I can give you
more money.

16:08.989 --> 16:10.523
There's your better life.

16:10.591 --> 16:12.659
I can let you come and go
as you please.

16:12.727 --> 16:14.460
There's your freedom.

16:14.528 --> 16:15.995
And you already know
Dunder-Mifflin

16:16.063 --> 16:18.264
has the best service
and the best prices.

16:18.332 --> 16:20.032
But you beat us anyway.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.001
- Can you imagine

16:22.068 --> 16:25.236
how well you would do
selling our stuff?

16:28.341 --> 16:30.709
Everyone,
may I have your attention?

16:30.777 --> 16:33.946
I would like to introduce you
to Mr. Danny Cordray.

16:34.013 --> 16:38.117
He's going to be joining us
as our new traveling salesman.

16:38.185 --> 16:39.552
Say hello to Danny!

16:39.619 --> 16:41.488
- me.

16:41.555 --> 16:43.390
- Okay.
You know what?

16:43.458 --> 16:45.059
No. No.

16:45.126 --> 16:47.828
This is not some sort
of construction site

16:47.896 --> 16:49.196
Or all of Italy

16:49.264 --> 16:51.298
Where you can just go around
treating people like meat.

16:51.366 --> 16:53.000
We are to respect him.

16:53.068 --> 16:56.702
I respect him because
he reminds me of somebody.

16:56.770 --> 16:58.636
Can anybody guess
who that is?

16:58.704 --> 17:01.072
- Josh Duhamel.
- Yeah, I can see that!

17:01.139 --> 17:03.840
- No. No. No.
Somebody in this office.

17:03.908 --> 17:05.974
- He's like
a better-looking Andy.

17:06.042 --> 17:07.242
- Thanks, Kevin.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.911
- No. Me.
Right?

17:09.979 --> 17:12.579
Sorta like...A little
younger version of me.

17:12.647 --> 17:14.648
- It's hard to judge ourselves
accurately, isn't it?

17:14.717 --> 17:15.717
- Michael.
- Yes.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.951
- Can I talk to you
about something?

17:17.019 --> 17:18.352
- No, you may not.

17:18.419 --> 17:19.819
- It's about this very
announcement you just made.

17:19.887 --> 17:21.255
- I just said no.
- Michael--

17:21.323 --> 17:23.223
- Michael, I think you
really want to talk to him.

17:23.290 --> 17:24.724
- Okay, let's--
all right, all right.

17:24.791 --> 17:26.392
Let's talk.
Please don't let him leave.

17:26.459 --> 17:27.759
Don't leave.
- Gotcha.

17:27.827 --> 17:30.460
- You hired him?
- Guys, let me ask you something.

17:30.528 --> 17:32.195
Do you want your life to be
better or worse

17:32.262 --> 17:34.163
- Or stay the same?
- Stay the same.

17:34.230 --> 17:37.364
- Okay. Well...Get ready,
'cause it's gonna get better.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.766
- It's not gonna get better.

17:38.834 --> 17:40.268
He's gonna steal
all of our clients.

17:40.335 --> 17:41.736
- No. No. Wrong.

17:41.803 --> 17:43.370
He would have stolen
your clients,

17:43.438 --> 17:45.172
But you know what?
He can't now.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.841
This guy used to steal
sales from us.

17:47.909 --> 17:49.743
Now he's going to steal
sales <i>for</i> us.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.545
- Where's he gonna sit?
There's no more seats.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.780
- He doesn't need to sit.
He's a traveling salesman.

17:53.848 --> 17:56.249
Look, I am not going to exclude
good people from our staff

17:56.317 --> 17:58.784
simply because
they are threatening to you.

17:58.852 --> 18:00.586
And unless you have a better
argument than that,

18:00.654 --> 18:02.021
I suggest you leave.

18:02.088 --> 18:03.788
- Mm!

18:03.856 --> 18:05.056
- Where's he gonna park?

18:05.124 --> 18:07.092
There's no more
reserved parking spots.

18:07.159 --> 18:08.326
- Good-bye!

18:11.929 --> 18:14.229
- Songs about truth.
- Yeah.

18:14.297 --> 18:15.930
- What's something
you really care about?

18:15.998 --> 18:18.199
- Reverse snobbery.

18:18.268 --> 18:19.367
- More universal.

18:19.435 --> 18:22.269
- Sometimes I feel like
life has passed me by.

18:23.971 --> 18:27.374

18:27.441 --> 18:29.876

18:32.480 --> 18:34.315
You just made that--

18:53.567 --> 18:55.935
- Oh, don't worry about it.

18:56.003 --> 18:57.437
- Wait.
Seriously?

18:57.505 --> 18:58.772
- Yeah.

18:58.839 --> 19:01.307
- So we're just like
jamming as friends?

went on a few dates.

19:10.618 --> 19:12.118
- Did ya?

19:12.186 --> 19:13.420
- Yeah, way, way,
way back.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.988
- I'm just kidding.
She told me about it.

19:15.056 --> 19:17.157
- Oh. Yeah.
She was not into me.

19:17.225 --> 19:18.625
- Oh.
- Obviously.

19:18.693 --> 19:19.993
- I don't even think
she called me back.

19:20.061 --> 19:22.329
- You snubbed <i>her.</i>
- Dwight, please.

19:22.396 --> 19:23.663
- Let me handle this, Jim.

19:23.731 --> 19:25.464
Drop the act, Cordray.
Okay?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.300
We all know
that you probably thought

19:27.368 --> 19:31.337
that Pam was too "meh"
or thin without being toned.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.871
But I wanna tell you something.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.807
She is one of the plain,
hearty women of Scranton

19:34.874 --> 19:37.042
that make this city great.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.577
And so what if she doesn't
wear makeup?

19:38.644 --> 19:40.645
- we like her better that way!

19:40.713 --> 19:42.413
And you steal clients,
don't you?

19:42.481 --> 19:44.382
Don't you!

19:44.450 --> 19:45.683
- Okay...That's different.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.251
- Oh, that's different,
is it?

19:47.319 --> 19:48.719
Okay, thief.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.587
You better check
your things, people.

19:50.655 --> 19:52.556
In fact,
where are my keys?

19:52.623 --> 19:54.758
Oh.
They're in my pocket.

19:54.825 --> 19:56.426
False alarm.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.928
Okay.

20:00.598 --> 20:03.266
So you're...
Gonna be workin' here.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.635
- Uh...I mean...

20:05.703 --> 20:06.936
Yeah.

20:07.004 --> 20:09.438
- Welcome aboard.

20:10.907 --> 20:12.674
- Thank you.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.676
- Hey, crazy, um...

20:14.744 --> 20:18.079
So...That's it?
You're just--you're fine?

20:18.147 --> 20:21.381
- It's after 5:00, Jim.
I'm not gonna take this home.

20:21.449 --> 20:23.183
- Oh.
- Pleasure.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.684
- Thanks.

20:24.752 --> 20:27.519
- This morning, Danny Cordray
stole a sale from me.

20:27.587 --> 20:28.787
So what do I do?

20:28.855 --> 20:30.956
I go out
and I steal Danny Cordray.

20:31.024 --> 20:32.724
The sale that mattered,
I made.

20:32.792 --> 20:33.958
Boom.

20:34.026 --> 20:35.726
Funny thing about it,
we don't even need him.

20:35.794 --> 20:38.362
We already have Packer
on the road.

20:38.429 --> 20:39.362
Ccchhh! Crap.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.131
I forgot about Packer.
