So, that's how you leave it?

14:48.626 --> 14:50.933
I mean, she don't want
you talkin' to me right?

15:05.817 --> 15:09.386
I ain't heard from Star
and them if that's what
you came here for.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.084
Is that why you came here?

15:11.736 --> 15:13.913
Cool. Thanks.

15:27.230 --> 15:30.103
You came here about
this damned script pad?

15:30.146 --> 15:31.887
-How you got this, Dai?
-Do it matter?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.934
You stole the script pad,
it is all over your face!

15:34.977 --> 15:36.196
Shh!

15:36.239 --> 15:37.371
I should go over there
and tell your mama.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.677
Don't. She ain't feeling good.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.897
She had a rough
time at grandmas.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.466
Alma could worry Iyanla
out her best life.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.990
David, why did you do this?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.731
We was broke.

15:51.298 --> 15:54.866
I was just tryin' to stop this,
make it easier.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.479
And you just let
them rope me in.

15:58.522 --> 16:02.178
I mean the way I see it,
you was happy too.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.571
Excuse me?

16:03.614 --> 16:05.573
I can't do this no more.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.010
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.319
But I need a way out.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.321
-How?
-For tonight.

16:14.364 --> 16:17.019
I said how, not when.

16:17.063 --> 16:21.241
Elijah, I need you to help
us get this off of us.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.025
Me and Raynan tryin'
to get his uncle

16:23.069 --> 16:27.029
who knows about this, who's
probably gonna hurt us or worse,

16:27.073 --> 16:29.075
to focus on somebody else.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.860
Someone more close to him.

16:34.558 --> 16:36.038
David, why don't
you just get Gloria

16:36.082 --> 16:37.474
to talk to this uncle?

16:37.518 --> 16:39.172
She can't.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.956
David I'm gonna explain
somethin' to you someday,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.742
-but women have a way with men.
-Nah.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.615
I think he might be
more like you.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.704
Oh, you clockin' folks.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.272
That kid is dead 'cause of us.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.187
-Willy gone because I let--
-I told them

16:54.230 --> 16:56.058
they was bein' sloppy.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.021
I'm tryin' to stop this before,

17:03.674 --> 17:05.850
before anyone else gets hurt.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.854
What?

17:09.898 --> 17:12.727
David, what, I can't do nothin'
with the lights cut off.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.083
[scoffs]

17:21.910 --> 17:23.129
You know what?

17:23.172 --> 17:25.218
I'ma have to stop
lettin' y'all come up

17:25.261 --> 17:27.220
in through my treasure trove.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.577
You gotta call Raynan.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.578
Pardon?

17:37.621 --> 17:38.753
Nice.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.276
Nice, next time try,

17:40.320 --> 17:41.669
"Uh-huh Dai."

17:41.712 --> 17:43.932
Thank you, uh-huh Dai.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.238
Pretty please.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.588
He has the numbers and
all the info you need.

17:47.631 --> 17:51.113
It's the last one Elijah,
I promise.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.550
[sighs]

17:53.594 --> 17:55.683
-Come on.
-You smilin' like your daddy,

17:55.726 --> 17:57.989
but you got Gloria in them eyes.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.687
What you up to?

17:59.730 --> 18:01.123
Your cell workin'?

18:02.211 --> 18:03.125
Yeah.

18:07.521 --> 18:11.002

18:13.266 --> 18:15.006
Only if pussy get you stuck.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.965
What if it don't work?

18:19.010 --> 18:22.971
Uncle Teo will make sure,
that we all get stuck.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.155
[typing]

18:38.682 --> 18:42.077
[Mrs. Hertrude] We started
a fund for Willy Derrick.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.036
I know we ain't got no
lights and some of y'all

18:45.080 --> 18:46.255
suffered damage from the storm.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.997
But we have a neighbor
who's in the rain

18:49.040 --> 18:51.173
and she needs our help.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.567
Well what about when
the lights come back on?

18:58.354 --> 19:00.574
We act like we don't
got a problem here.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.753
That baby died 'cause he was
runnin' around with them boys.

19:05.796 --> 19:08.364
It shouldn't take somebody
grievin' for a child

19:08.408 --> 19:10.149
for us to act on it.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.499
We seen it.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.764
We see who doin' it.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.420
And we need to call him out.

19:21.377 --> 19:25.338
That's right,
I'm talkin' to you, son.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.124
This new crew bringin'

19:29.168 --> 19:31.431
and we need you to speak up.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.347
Otherwise,

19:34.390 --> 19:36.566
-this death on your hands.
-Uh-uh!

19:36.610 --> 19:38.133
-Don't do that!
-What you mean?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.526
-Don't do that!
-Gloria!

19:39.569 --> 19:41.441
They here to mourn
their friend.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.225
-Whatever.
-You right.

19:43.269 --> 19:44.531
You just gonna make
him act to be some--

19:44.574 --> 19:46.228
Look, look, look.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.970
I know...

19:49.013 --> 19:50.711
I know I gotta do somethin'.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.496
I haven't been doin' my part.

19:54.541 --> 19:58.240
I've been so busy tryin'
to get outta here.

20:00.373 --> 20:03.245
Tryin' to go to
a different school elsewhere.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.337
Look I'm sorry for Willy, I am.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.384
He was a friend to my brother.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.821
I ain't dealin'.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.302
Y'all know that.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.698
But I do know somethin'.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.657
And if I say somethin',

20:25.136 --> 20:26.703
y'all know what that mean.

20:28.879 --> 20:33.797
That mean they gonna
hurt my family and me.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.801
But that's why we gotta
stick together.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.156
We gotta stay ready.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.943
Stay ready,
we won't have to get ready.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.684
[crowd murmurs in agreement]

20:59.345 --> 21:02.304
Uh-uh, uh-uh, not tonight.

21:03.914 --> 21:05.002
I got company.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.787
What?

21:06.830 --> 21:07.831
I can't come in?

21:07.875 --> 21:09.311
You cannot.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.402
A'ight.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.099
You was beggin' for me.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.319
Now I can't come in?

21:17.363 --> 21:18.451
A'ight then.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.931
Nasty ass faggot boy.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.977
I'd tell your buddy in there,
better be careful.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.023
-Y'all loose with it.
-I screen quarterly.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.503
You should too.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.852
I ain't no faggot.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.334
Do you even know what you are?

21:38.384 --> 21:39.863
You a distraction.

21:39.907 --> 21:43.084
I let your ass distract me
a few times to get me right.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.825
Get my head right.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.348
But yeah, it s cool.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.132
I see how this shit work.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.699
Just give me my shit back.

21:50.874 --> 21:51.962
You want your kiss back?

21:52.006 --> 21:53.399
No, you nasty ass...

21:55.401 --> 21:58.012
No, my script pad,
you know what it is.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.840
Get your hands off me.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.190
You see a blouse and some makeup

22:02.233 --> 22:03.539
but I will come

22:03.583 --> 22:05.324
and show you she's born with it.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.602
That's the last one I'm afraid.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.431
If your boss wants the rest,
he know where I live.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.997
I just need my money.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.782
Nah, you ain't gettin' shit.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.262
I'm out this bitch.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.917
Fuckin' shone,

[giggles]

22:54.808 --> 22:56.287
[sighs]

22:58.159 --> 22:59.856
All right, David,

22:59.900 --> 23:02.381

23:08.865 --> 23:10.301
[gasping]

23:11.564 --> 23:13.914
You not made for this nephew.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.744
You're not.

23:19.354 --> 23:22.575
I love that about you.

23:26.535 --> 23:30.670
I told you, I would never let
someone put a hand on you.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.460
I was you in my family.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.467
El negrito.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.338
The darkest one.

23:49.297 --> 23:54.781
And everyone, the whole family,
used to put hands on me.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.523
That's why I promised,
when you was born,

23:57.566 --> 24:01.962
and you came out already
black and beautiful,

24:02.005 --> 24:05.444
not one mark on this one.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.055
This one, mine.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.500
Now,

24:22.025 --> 24:24.288
I love you.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.465
But you're fucking
up my business.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.512
So you fired.

24:33.384 --> 24:34.516
Okay?

24:36.387 --> 24:37.519
Okay.

24:39.695 --> 24:42.916
Now I gotta go clean up
another mess you made.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.531
Let's talk about your
little friend David.

24:58.801 --> 25:04.546

25:36.143 --> 25:37.536
Hello.

Hi David.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.235
Hi.

25:41.278 --> 25:42.889
Don't worry.

25:42.932 --> 25:45.979
I think everybody too happy

25:47.502 --> 25:48.677
I'm lookin' for Seren.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.679
He ain't over here.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.640
I know, I--

25:54.683 --> 25:56.685
They say it's good to retrace.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.865
He was with you last, I know it.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.786
David,

26:12.266 --> 26:13.659

26:14.790 --> 26:16.575
What about it?

26:17.140 --> 26:18.751
What did it mean?

26:19.490 --> 26:20.535
Ask Seren.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.058
I can't!

26:22.102 --> 26:24.583
Yeah me neither.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.671
You know somethin'!

26:25.714 --> 26:27.586
You know! You fuckin' know!

26:32.808 --> 26:34.767
You never texted him.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.598
You know.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.689
You don't wanna
know what I know.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.693
I know about
bruises up and down.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.652
So bad he can't even
stand up straight.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.133
And when he not duckin' hits,

26:53.176 --> 26:55.309
he tryin' to keep
nigga's out his sheets.

26:57.528 --> 26:59.661
You don't wanna
know what I know.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.926
You wanna take your ass home
and hope they find my friend.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.194
Take off, Mrs. Kelly.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.676
We got a lot goin'

27:15.242 --> 27:16.722
Be safe.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.186
You leavin'?

27:48.275 --> 27:49.798
You don't need me anymore.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.238
I'll always need you.

27:55.282 --> 27:59.329
I'm always there,
for whatever you wanna ask.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.291
Not for everything.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.294
Try me.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.734
I would ask you,

28:12.778 --> 28:15.737
what was your last day
on Earth like?

28:19.088 --> 28:20.699
Hm.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.745
I would ask you...

28:24.833 --> 28:26.705
your favorite food,

28:29.446 --> 28:30.883
your favorite song.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.282
I would ask...

28:39.326 --> 28:41.371
if you had any regrets,

28:44.331 --> 28:46.072
anything you'd take back.

28:51.642 --> 28:54.210
And if you had one wish.

28:57.953 --> 29:00.347
That my son would
be better than me.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.919
Am I?

29:13.403 --> 29:15.318
Am I better?

29:20.628 --> 29:22.238
You the man.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.917
I would ask...

29:53.052 --> 29:55.794
what you would've wanted
to do with your life.

That's what you
wanted them to see?

30:48.934 --> 30:50.196
I was just tryin' to help.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.980
Help?

30:52.024 --> 30:56.028

So what?

31:06.125 --> 31:08.257
You think 'cause
you told the truth--

31:08.301 --> 31:11.217
The truth don't fix shit.
Okay?
