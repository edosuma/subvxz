00:42.922 --> 00:44.082
Do you understand?

00:44.190 --> 00:47.250
We, the Falafel family,

00:47.393 --> 00:49.258
from the very beginning until now,

00:49.362 --> 00:53.628
have ruled the desert
with one thing - ''speed''.

00:54.434 --> 00:56.402
Our ants run faster than others.

00:56.602 --> 00:58.570
We spend money faster than others.

00:58.705 --> 01:01.674
Now, from the ground...

01:03.042 --> 01:05.203
suddenly...

01:06.913 --> 01:10.076
Our planes fly faster than others.

01:10.249 --> 01:13.616
We have the fastest boats
and the fastest cars

01:13.753 --> 01:16.313
except for one.

01:16.923 --> 01:18.083
It is you!

01:18.191 --> 01:21.456
Last year I sent you
to race the Cannonball Run

01:21.561 --> 01:25.429
to let people know about
the Falafel family.

01:25.598 --> 01:27.657
The fastest family in the world.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.668
We could have won.

01:32.105 --> 01:35.563
But you guit during the race.

01:36.976 --> 01:38.238
A thousand thanks.

01:38.377 --> 01:40.641
Please listen to me.
We drove too fast,

01:40.747 --> 01:42.408
and that caused a flat tire.

01:42.515 --> 01:44.881
- Father.
- Stop explaining!

01:45.084 --> 01:48.850
You have already disgraced
the Falafel family.

01:51.724 --> 01:53.282
A thousand thanks.

01:58.865 --> 02:01.231
Do you have a blonde slave

02:01.367 --> 02:03.927
for any special reason?

02:05.404 --> 02:06.462
Don't underestimate him.

02:06.572 --> 02:09.039
Prior to becoming a slave,
he was a hotshot on TV.

02:09.208 --> 02:10.765
That's right.

02:14.781 --> 02:16.339
Two thousand thanks.

02:16.549 --> 02:19.814
If it weren't for my ulcer,
I would have won the last time.

02:19.919 --> 02:21.284
The worst part is...

02:21.888 --> 02:25.551
I order you to return to America

02:25.758 --> 02:29.216
to win the Cannonball Run.

02:29.362 --> 02:31.922
The problem is none of us
has a driver's license.

02:32.732 --> 02:35.200
Otherwise, I wouldn't ask you.

02:35.368 --> 02:36.835
But Father,

02:37.003 --> 02:39.563
there's no Cannonball Run this year.

02:39.739 --> 02:42.003
No race? Then organize one.

02:43.009 --> 02:45.068
I know what to do.

03:07.066 --> 03:08.226
Someone is speeding.

03:08.434 --> 03:10.197
Someone really has guts
but no regard for life.

03:12.939 --> 03:14.702
I'm not sure about that.
The ticket's going to be expensive.

03:14.941 --> 03:16.704
- Here they come.
- We have to chase them.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.233
''Speed Limit: 55 m.p.h.''

03:46.372 --> 03:48.840
''Speed Limit: 155 m.p.h.''

04:20.740 --> 04:21.603
This car is really fast.

04:21.774 --> 04:24.038
A white car is coming at you
in about 3 seconds.

04:24.343 --> 04:25.605
You're exaggerating.

04:25.778 --> 04:28.338
Right, there are two pretty girls
in the car.

04:43.429 --> 04:46.296
This is a straight road.
How could we miss them?

04:46.732 --> 04:49.200
Calm down. Look for dust and dirt.

04:49.402 --> 04:50.960
It must be them.

04:56.809 --> 04:58.276
We really have lost them.

05:01.414 --> 05:03.678
The two girls are driving
a white Lamborghini.

05:03.816 --> 05:05.681
How could we have missed them?

05:07.420 --> 05:09.285
Really, we didn't see them.

05:10.089 --> 05:12.649
I saw it.
This time, we won't lose them.

05:12.825 --> 05:14.588
Don't get cocky.

05:19.665 --> 05:22.725
We'll split up.
They won't get away.

05:24.537 --> 05:26.198
Let's do it.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.021
I'm heading south-east,
chasing a white Lamborghini.

05:50.229 --> 05:52.094
Be on the lookout.

06:15.521 --> 06:17.489
Thank you.

06:35.541 --> 06:37.805
Did I have too much drink or what?

06:37.877 --> 06:39.538
The white Lamborghini is gone.

06:39.678 --> 06:42.044
But here comes a red one.

06:42.248 --> 06:46.412
That isn't right.
There are two more girls speeding.

07:09.909 --> 07:11.968
It's boring racing with them.

07:12.311 --> 07:14.472
The Cannonball Run is much better.

07:14.613 --> 07:17.173
Right. There's a Cannonball Run
this year.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.816
Why don't we compete race?

07:18.984 --> 07:20.349
It must be exciting.

07:20.519 --> 07:23.283
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.281
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:56.388 --> 07:58.549
welcome to the Human Cannonball show.

07:58.691 --> 08:02.354
Get ready to be thrilled
by a brave performer.

08:03.129 --> 08:06.997
This stunt pushes human ability
to its limit.

08:07.066 --> 08:09.432
This is a record-breaking event

08:09.602 --> 08:11.263
that defies death.

08:11.437 --> 08:14.998
It's a gamble of life.

08:22.014 --> 08:25.074
J.J., is this going to work?

08:26.519 --> 08:28.384
It'll work.

08:28.921 --> 08:31.481
- We're going to be rich.
- Rich...?

08:31.657 --> 08:33.419
We're going to split
all the money in half.

08:33.558 --> 08:35.720
We're partners.

08:35.828 --> 08:38.388
- You perform and I get the money.
- That's fair.

08:38.464 --> 08:42.230
- You won't go wrong with me.
- Because we're partners.

08:42.902 --> 08:44.563
My part is more dangerous.

08:45.204 --> 08:46.364
Don't be a chicken.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.104
The pilot is very experienced.

08:50.276 --> 08:52.437
- He can do it with his eyes closed.
- Closed eyes?

08:52.545 --> 08:54.706
Don't be afraid.
He'll drop you gently.

08:55.481 --> 08:58.041
- Then you'll go through that.
- Go through what?

08:58.250 --> 09:01.515
- Go through a net. It's very safe.
- Really?

09:01.587 --> 09:03.145
There's hay behind it.

09:03.255 --> 09:06.315
If you don't catch the net,
you'll wind up as a scarecrow.

09:06.892 --> 09:08.450
What if it doesn't work?

09:08.627 --> 09:10.788
- It's not dangerous?
- I'm very calm.

09:10.963 --> 09:13.523
- Have some confidence.
- Right.

09:13.732 --> 09:15.791
If you have confidence,
I won't be worried.

09:15.935 --> 09:17.698
Good luck.

09:17.836 --> 09:20.304
- J.J., I'm still scared.
- Scared?

09:20.506 --> 09:24.169
If you are scared,
then change into Captain Chaos.

09:24.376 --> 09:25.536
Everything will be fine.

09:25.678 --> 09:29.444
Captain Chaos only appears
when human life is in grave danger.

09:30.482 --> 09:34.043
Right, ask him to come.

09:39.391 --> 09:41.256
Hello, this is Jack Smith.

09:41.393 --> 09:43.953
We brought our camera

09:44.096 --> 09:45.859
to report

09:45.965 --> 09:47.626
to our viewers

09:47.733 --> 09:49.598
who will witness a stunt

09:50.336 --> 09:53.203
called the Human Cannonball.

09:53.339 --> 09:56.604
A human bomb will be dropped
at 140 m.p.h.

09:56.842 --> 09:59.606
If he is lucky,

09:59.745 --> 10:02.305
he will become a national hero.

10:02.448 --> 10:04.814
His face will not only be seen
on magazine covers,

10:05.017 --> 10:06.780
but millions of adoring women

10:06.852 --> 10:08.217
will be at his feet.

10:08.387 --> 10:13.051
He will be surrounded by women.

10:19.598 --> 10:20.963
Clumsy oaf.

10:23.602 --> 10:26.162
J.J., long time no see.

10:26.405 --> 10:27.770
You look great.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.208
I think I'd better take your place.

10:30.309 --> 10:32.174
l'll do it. We're good partners.

10:32.311 --> 10:33.175
It's better if i take your place.

10:33.379 --> 10:34.437
- Really?
- Right.

10:34.613 --> 10:35.773
Then go ahead.

10:36.181 --> 10:37.148
Thank you.

10:37.383 --> 10:38.850
- Be cool.
- I will.

10:39.918 --> 10:41.180
He's in grave danger.

10:44.690 --> 10:47.955
Drinking beer is better
than doing anything else.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.324
Drinking beer...

10:52.498 --> 10:59.461
lced cold beer...with chicken wings...

10:59.972 --> 11:01.940
Let me take a sip to wake myself up.

11:04.910 --> 11:05.672
What's the matter?

11:05.844 --> 11:06.902
I want to go down.

11:07.112 --> 11:09.672
That's easy. Watch me.

11:21.794 --> 11:25.252
Don't blink. The Human Cannonball
is ready to be dropped.

11:28.467 --> 11:30.628
Everything is ready.

11:59.631 --> 12:02.293
The smart has the ideas.
The dumb one does the work.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.692
An ambulance is here

12:03.836 --> 12:05.804
to see if he's all right.

12:06.205 --> 12:09.174
The pilot is great.
Are you all right?

12:09.341 --> 12:12.401
It's really exciting. It's great.
The event was wonderful.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.305
- You really accomplished something.
- Pull me out first.

12:14.446 --> 12:16.607
- It's fabulous. We'll be rich.
- Hurry up!

12:16.715 --> 12:18.478
You'll be a star
and appear on magazine covers.

12:18.617 --> 12:20.881
You can do whatever you want, J.J.

12:22.187 --> 12:24.747
J.J...
you seem to be shorter?

12:24.923 --> 12:26.481
J.J., are you all right?

12:26.892 --> 12:28.553
- We'll make tons of money now.
- Is that right?

12:28.727 --> 12:31.287
If we perform this ten times a day
for about a year,

12:31.463 --> 12:32.828
we'll be billionaires.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.562
What?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.828
The prize for the Cannonball Run
is a million dollars.

12:37.970 --> 12:39.733
It's just a small amount.
It's nothing.

12:39.938 --> 12:41.303
A lottery prize is more than this.

12:44.410 --> 12:45.468
Did i say something wrong?

12:45.644 --> 12:47.612
You want me to perform this
ten times a day?

12:48.113 --> 12:49.478
How about nine times?

12:51.116 --> 12:52.879
I just want you to be rich.

13:01.093 --> 13:05.359
I want to discuss something
at this meeting today.

13:05.597 --> 13:10.864
Our family has had money
and power for a long time.

13:11.036 --> 13:14.699
I control everything in America,

13:14.873 --> 13:18.240
prostitution, gambling,

13:18.410 --> 13:23.370
drugs, racketeering,
and prostitution.

13:23.515 --> 13:27.076
Boss, you said prostitution twice.

13:27.186 --> 13:33.147
I like it.
Our business has gone down.

13:33.292 --> 13:37.251
Guys, who worked for us before,
work for other families.

13:37.362 --> 13:41.628
They don't even consider us.
Why is this?

13:42.234 --> 13:43.701
It is because we're nice guys?

13:44.002 --> 13:46.163
Is the interest too high?

13:46.338 --> 13:47.999
Too many people emigrate?

13:54.246 --> 13:55.713
None of the above.

13:56.748 --> 14:01.708
No...you're all stupid.

14:01.787 --> 14:03.755
I didn't know we'd be playing
a guessing game.

14:03.922 --> 14:05.480
Give us a hint.

14:06.859 --> 14:10.727
Last year, i passed my business
over to my son, Don Don.

14:10.896 --> 14:14.457
I asked you all to assist him

14:14.633 --> 14:18.694
to increase business.

14:19.304 --> 14:20.965
And what are the results?

14:21.874 --> 14:25.742
He has only brought our family
disgrace and shame.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.208
What happened?

14:32.851 --> 14:34.512
This cat is dead.

14:37.189 --> 14:38.850
Give me a new cat.

14:43.428 --> 14:50.391
Even cats can't survive.
Thank you.

14:52.337 --> 14:56.296
This hair is soft. It's interesting.

14:57.976 --> 14:59.341
It's a boy.

15:04.116 --> 15:08.485
Go and bring Don Don back.

15:10.122 --> 15:11.384
Don Don.

15:12.057 --> 15:14.025
Your father wants us
to learn about your affairs.

15:14.526 --> 15:17.086
What are your assets?

15:17.696 --> 15:22.065
I'm...i'm good-natured,
and i dress well, and...

15:22.234 --> 15:26.102
No. What about your liabilities?

15:26.338 --> 15:31.002
Well, there is one small liability.

15:31.209 --> 15:32.369
What...?

15:32.744 --> 15:35.713
I could use a tummy tuck.

15:35.781 --> 15:37.248
- A tummy tuck?
- Yes, i have to pee.

15:37.449 --> 15:38.609
You have to pee?

15:39.818 --> 15:43.686
- I'm going to kill you...
- Calm down.

15:44.623 --> 15:48.081
Don Don,
do you have any outstanding debts?

15:48.860 --> 15:50.225
It's all here.

15:50.829 --> 15:51.989
Take a guick look.

15:54.032 --> 15:58.594
$30,000?
We have to get the money back.

16:00.472 --> 16:01.837
Fenderbaum?

16:02.007 --> 16:04.475
- Right.
- We have to get it back.

16:08.313 --> 16:10.474
You better tell Jim
where his car is.

16:10.649 --> 16:13.311
Me again?
It's your turn.

16:18.290 --> 16:19.450
How are you?

16:19.992 --> 16:21.960
Can i help you ladies?

16:22.260 --> 16:23.522
Our car broke down.

16:24.463 --> 16:26.328
Right.

16:26.531 --> 16:28.294
Take a hike?

16:29.067 --> 16:30.432
Get lost.

16:34.773 --> 16:36.240
What a jerk!

16:36.808 --> 16:38.673
- What are we going to do?
- Martha.

16:40.078 --> 16:42.046
Come here...

16:42.147 --> 16:44.911
Come on here, baby.

16:48.253 --> 16:49.413
Are you all right?

16:50.188 --> 16:54.056
Could be. This is a beauty,
just like you.

16:54.159 --> 16:55.524
It's about average.

16:55.694 --> 16:58.663
I have to enjoy it
before the license fee goes up.

16:58.830 --> 17:00.092
What do you want?

17:00.265 --> 17:03.132
- A ride.
- All right. Get in.

17:04.002 --> 17:05.663
- I'm Martha.
- I'm Jill.

17:05.837 --> 17:08.305
- I'm George.
- You're a nice guy.

17:12.010 --> 17:14.877
Attention Japan Cargo.
Please land at hangar three.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.445
Roger.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.415
We're in trouble.
We have to go through customs.

17:20.618 --> 17:22.176
And they'll impound the car.

17:22.354 --> 17:24.015
And we won't be able
to enter the race.

17:24.222 --> 17:25.587
What shall we do?

17:26.657 --> 17:28.922
- Land immediately.
- All right.

17:29.761 --> 17:30.921
Take emergency action.

17:31.697 --> 17:33.358
A cop car is following us.

17:33.765 --> 17:35.426
- Get rid of it.
- Roger.

17:38.036 --> 17:40.095
- Take action 9.
- Roger.

18:21.179 --> 18:22.840
Great, look for a place to hide.

19:07.726 --> 19:09.489
I know you are in there.
Open the door.

19:10.195 --> 19:13.255
Open the door, Blake. It's Fenderbaum.

19:13.732 --> 19:15.393
It's me.

19:18.203 --> 19:19.670
I know you're in there.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.156
I know a way.

19:44.396 --> 19:49.766
Men...Women...

19:52.270 --> 19:56.229
When i make a dry Martini,
it's really a dry Martini.

20:02.347 --> 20:05.316
- Someone's knocking at the window.
- It's the window cleaner.

20:07.686 --> 20:11.452
- Go and see who it is.
- Forget it. I don't have the time.

20:11.690 --> 20:14.557
Blake, open the window, let me in.

20:15.794 --> 20:19.059
Let me handle this.
I'll be back.

20:20.999 --> 20:26.266
Someone sure picked the wrong time.
It's annoying.

20:26.404 --> 20:28.770
Blake, I'm here.

20:31.476 --> 20:33.740
I'm in a serious situation.
You leave first.

20:33.912 --> 20:36.472
Blake, I'm here on serious business.

20:36.581 --> 20:38.139
- What a coincidence?
- Right.

20:45.290 --> 20:47.656
Do you want to kill me?
This is the 18th floor.

20:47.826 --> 20:48.884
Really? It's the 18th floor?

20:49.060 --> 20:51.324
- The 18th floor?
- Right, the 18th floor.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.260
Really?

21:04.476 --> 21:07.741
You are the tallest short guy
l've ever seen.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.039
- Read this good news.
- What?

21:11.216 --> 21:14.879
The Sheikh is organizing
the Cannonball Run this year.

21:15.086 --> 21:17.850
First prize is one million dollars.

21:18.056 --> 21:21.025
If we win, we'll be rich.

21:21.526 --> 21:23.391
Be careful! Watch out!

21:23.595 --> 21:26.655
- Don't come in. l'll come out.
- Blake.

21:29.868 --> 21:31.130
Where are you going?

21:31.269 --> 21:33.829
I don't need you
when I have a million dollars.

21:34.005 --> 21:35.267
You creep.

21:38.476 --> 21:40.137
How come you become
a window cleaner?

21:40.245 --> 21:41.803
Just now. It was the only way
to make you come out.

21:57.429 --> 21:59.989
You're on time, Doctor.

22:01.099 --> 22:04.557
- Money can make anyone on time.
- Smart.

22:04.903 --> 22:07.463
Don't worry.
I can cure those who aren't sick.

22:08.073 --> 22:11.531
I can't cure the ones who are sick.

22:11.810 --> 22:14.779
I have to win the Cannonball Run
this time.

22:14.980 --> 22:17.744
That's why I need you
to take care of me on the road.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.976
Are you good at curing ulcers?

22:21.119 --> 22:23.383
My speciality is haemorrhoids.

22:25.590 --> 22:28.354
I guess it's all the same.

22:28.526 --> 22:32.986
My examination will cure you.

22:33.598 --> 22:36.066
Let me give you a check-up.

22:36.568 --> 22:38.934
Open up your mouth.

22:42.941 --> 22:46.604
I'm clean. You know my rules.

22:47.512 --> 22:52.575
Everyone has to pay me
no matter who it is.

22:54.285 --> 22:58.654
Right...you're good.

23:01.593 --> 23:04.061
What are you doing? Drinking milk?

23:04.696 --> 23:07.460
It won't improve your health
if you fool around like this.

23:07.599 --> 23:09.658
It's better than nothing.

23:11.636 --> 23:12.694
Can i help you?

23:13.138 --> 23:14.400
Whiskey and water.

23:14.739 --> 23:16.502
Does anyone speak Oriental?

23:17.142 --> 23:19.303
Two Whiskeys and water.

23:19.577 --> 23:21.841
I'll get you something.

23:28.119 --> 23:33.887
Are you deaf?
Whiskey and water. Go.

23:36.661 --> 23:39.528
- Hurry.
- All right, coming right up.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.031
We'll get a bottle of champagne.

23:43.201 --> 23:45.169
And we'll go up to my place.

23:45.503 --> 23:47.266
Father, what are you saying?

23:48.706 --> 23:51.072
Haven't you seen The Thornbirds?

23:53.812 --> 23:57.270
Pal, this outfit is no good.

23:57.415 --> 24:00.782
You can look but you can't touch.
It's a pity.

24:01.386 --> 24:03.354
Why do i still feel hungry?

24:03.588 --> 24:05.351
Order something again.

24:05.523 --> 24:09.391
Roast pigeon tastes good,
at a good price.

24:09.527 --> 24:11.995
What about steak? Last time l...

24:13.331 --> 24:15.196
I'm not talking about food.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.800
What are you talking about?

24:16.935 --> 24:19.699
- I meant women.
- Women.

24:19.904 --> 24:22.065
If there aren't women in this world,

24:22.340 --> 24:24.808
being a rich man is meaningless.

24:24.976 --> 24:27.843
- Right, i agree.
- You agree?

24:28.079 --> 24:31.537
Yes, J.J., I'm not gay.

24:31.716 --> 24:32.683
I know you're not.

24:32.917 --> 24:37.377
You're just a little different.

24:39.524 --> 24:40.684
I'm just kidding.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.158
If you want a girl,
I'll give you one of mine.

24:43.261 --> 24:44.228
But that's how you get diseases.

24:44.362 --> 24:45.420
It wouldn't be a coincidence.

24:45.497 --> 24:48.466
Then hurry up.
I can't hold on anymore.

24:51.069 --> 24:52.536
- What's up?
- Seems like we have the girls.

24:52.737 --> 24:53.897
We'll have fun tonight.

24:54.038 --> 24:54.800
Yeah, have fun tonight.

24:55.006 --> 24:57.167
- What fun?
- Let's go.

25:00.745 --> 25:03.305
You have to leave after the fun.

25:05.016 --> 25:06.278
J.J. how are you?

25:06.417 --> 25:09.386
- Do you have any plans tonight?
- Not yet.

25:09.521 --> 25:12.388
Let's have fun tonight.

25:12.824 --> 25:14.086
Count me in.

25:30.542 --> 25:34.706
Do we still owe Don Don $30,000?

25:35.280 --> 25:37.248
- Didn't you pay him back?
- No.

25:37.849 --> 25:40.613
That means
you still owe him $30,000.

25:41.653 --> 25:44.918
Some collectors are here
for the money.

25:45.056 --> 25:46.921
What collectors? Where?

25:47.058 --> 25:48.923
They're at the entrance. Don't look.

25:50.995 --> 25:53.657
Stupid, i told you not to look.

25:53.865 --> 25:57.232
They're at the entrance,
so we'll sneak out the back door.

25:57.402 --> 26:00.371
They can't be in two places
at the same time.

26:00.838 --> 26:03.102
- Good idea.
- Of course.

26:11.282 --> 26:12.647
We're dead this time.

26:14.886 --> 26:17.150
They won't be easy on us.

26:17.222 --> 26:18.883
You signed the loan.

26:19.057 --> 26:21.821
Then it has nothing to do with me.

26:29.767 --> 26:31.428
If you don't pay, you won't live.

26:32.237 --> 26:34.000
My life isn't worth anything.

26:36.741 --> 26:39.710
Listen to me.
Do you think we'd run away?

26:39.811 --> 26:41.278
We know we owe you money.

26:41.412 --> 26:43.972
That's why we're here?

26:44.148 --> 26:46.412
Then, tell me what you want to do.

26:46.584 --> 26:49.246
We want to enter the Cannonball Run.

26:49.354 --> 26:51.618
We want to win the million dollars
and pay our debt.

26:51.789 --> 26:54.155
What idiot would offer
that much money?

26:55.326 --> 26:58.693
Fenderbaum, Blake,
aren't you both in the race?

26:58.930 --> 27:01.797
Why don't you go rest?

27:01.866 --> 27:03.731
It starts early tomorrow.

27:07.739 --> 27:10.606
You guys don't have taste.

27:13.211 --> 27:17.477
Take the money.
The Godfather look is out.

27:17.715 --> 27:18.977
Buy yourself something new.

27:19.617 --> 27:20.879
That's him.

27:21.619 --> 27:25.282
It seems like this Sheikh is rich.

27:45.810 --> 27:48.472
Boss, it's nice to see you.

27:49.447 --> 27:54.407
You look handsome.
Welcome to the Pinto Ranch.

27:54.519 --> 27:56.077
Do you want to have some fun today?

28:01.092 --> 28:03.458
- May i have a chair?
- Of course.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.596
This is serious.

28:10.802 --> 28:13.464
My...my father, do you know him?

28:13.638 --> 28:15.799
Do you mind if i call you Dumb-Dumb?

28:16.941 --> 28:18.499
Okay. Dumb-Dumb.

28:19.243 --> 28:21.711
Your father knows
you are a bum.

28:21.879 --> 28:23.437
That's why he asked me to help you.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.082
So he sent you to Las Vegas

28:26.250 --> 28:28.309
to learn the business from me.

28:28.519 --> 28:32.182
So what did i do?
I gave you a job on this ranch.

28:32.357 --> 28:35.224
But you only fool around
with the girls here.

28:35.259 --> 28:36.123
I just slept with one girl.

28:36.327 --> 28:38.989
- The girl was ugly.
- Shut up.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.690
Forget about that.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.769
I lent you the money
to operate a prostitution ring.

28:45.903 --> 28:50.465
- The economy isn't doing well.
- Is that right?

28:52.176 --> 28:53.040
How much does he owe?

28:53.111 --> 28:54.772
As of 9:30 a.m.,

28:54.879 --> 28:59.145
with compound interest
and administrative fees,

28:59.283 --> 29:04.550
the total is $9,332,448.55.

29:05.490 --> 29:07.151
Mr. Hahn, I'm doing the best i can.

29:07.325 --> 29:09.384
What? You're going to die.

29:12.597 --> 29:14.656
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

29:14.799 --> 29:17.165
You have to pay off your debt
by tomorrow.

29:17.301 --> 29:20.862
You still have a day.
Tomorrow is the due date.

29:21.139 --> 29:23.004
- Great.
- Shut up.

29:24.642 --> 29:29.306
You'll be dead if you don't pay
within 24 hours.

29:30.815 --> 29:33.079
Don't ever have a name like his.

29:33.918 --> 29:35.078
What do you think?

29:38.523 --> 29:41.083
- It's funny, boss.
- Don't laugh.

29:41.492 --> 29:43.357
No one can laugh
without my permission.

29:45.296 --> 29:47.059
So that's it. Dumb-Dumb.

29:48.666 --> 29:51.032
Mr. Hahn, i have a guestion.

29:51.803 --> 29:53.270
I'm dead.

29:56.941 --> 29:58.408
Anymore guestions?

29:58.543 --> 30:01.706
No...no guestions.

30:07.185 --> 30:08.743
Is he really your uncle?

30:08.886 --> 30:10.945
He is also your uncle.

30:11.088 --> 30:12.055
The relationship is complicated.

30:12.223 --> 30:14.282
I still don't understand.

30:14.859 --> 30:18.226
He used to visit us often.
I call his mother, Aunt.

30:18.362 --> 30:20.922
Your mother
and my mother are sisters.

30:26.671 --> 30:28.036
He's the spouse of our eldest aunt.

30:28.172 --> 30:30.037
I haven't seen him for a long time.

30:30.708 --> 30:33.472
I only know he drives a white car.

30:34.011 --> 30:35.569
My mother never mentioned him.

30:37.515 --> 30:38.777
Uncle.

30:42.620 --> 30:46.579
Sons, my place sells high-end cars.

30:46.724 --> 30:48.885
Nowadays, we have ways
of doing business.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.121
I started my business here.

30:51.462 --> 30:56.422
Uncle, I'm Melvin.
You held me when i was a child.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.632
Are you really my nephews?

30:58.803 --> 31:00.862
I am Susan's son.

31:01.205 --> 31:02.570
I don't recall.

31:03.841 --> 31:07.902
That doesn't matter.
Doesn't that driver look different?

31:09.547 --> 31:11.208
He...is a bit special.

31:11.415 --> 31:14.782
Not only that, he looks strange.

31:14.919 --> 31:17.080
I didn't know it was so easy
to get a license here.

31:18.155 --> 31:21.124
He doesn't have a license of course.
Come here...

31:21.692 --> 31:23.557
I drive from the back.

31:23.694 --> 31:26.254
He just pretends to drive the car.

31:26.497 --> 31:29.159
It's my way of doing business.
Here's my slogan...

31:29.333 --> 31:33.201
''If a monkey can drive, so can you.''

31:36.707 --> 31:40.666
He's interesting.
I treat him like my partner.

31:42.213 --> 31:44.579
Come, partner, isn't this fun?

31:45.650 --> 31:46.912
Yes, it's fun.

31:47.051 --> 31:49.417
Uncle, we have a small problem.

31:49.620 --> 31:53.283
Yes. We're broke.
We're almost bankrupt.

31:53.558 --> 31:54.820
We want to borrow your car.

31:57.395 --> 31:58.953
Are you going to use it
for something illegal?

31:59.096 --> 32:02.964
No, we want to get into a race.

32:03.067 --> 32:04.432
The Cannonball Run.

32:05.169 --> 32:08.832
Stop it. I told you not to play
with the phone.

32:10.474 --> 32:13.932
This stupid monkey always makes
long distance calls by mistake.

32:15.746 --> 32:19.307
Stupid monkey. Stop it.

32:19.550 --> 32:23.111
Wait a second.
I'll teach him a lesson.

32:24.522 --> 32:25.682
Stupid monkey.

32:28.826 --> 32:30.088
I can't stand this anymore.

32:33.731 --> 32:36.700
Let's do this.
I will lend you the car.

32:36.901 --> 32:39.563
But you have to bring him along.

32:39.670 --> 32:41.934
You don't have to pay me if he dies.

32:47.478 --> 32:49.639
I didn't expect

32:49.847 --> 32:51.109
to look so real in a nun's habit.

32:51.716 --> 32:54.583
It's so hot in this outfit.

32:54.719 --> 32:56.186
- I want to get a cup of coffee.
- Good.

32:56.420 --> 32:58.581
- Are we scheduled tomorrow?
- Yes...

32:59.924 --> 33:01.391
I'm sick of playing small roles.

33:01.626 --> 33:03.093
I don't even have a line.

33:03.227 --> 33:06.390
Dreaming of becoming a star
is ruining my life.

33:11.302 --> 33:13.463
My goodness, it's so crowded here.

33:14.672 --> 33:16.640
We're finished.
You can have our seats.

33:16.874 --> 33:18.842
- Thank you.
- You're so nice.

33:18.943 --> 33:20.706
God bless you.

33:27.351 --> 33:30.616
I'm sick and tired
of being a supporting actress.

33:30.755 --> 33:32.120
I really want to change my career.

33:32.289 --> 33:33.449
Betty, you can't rush things.

33:33.557 --> 33:34.922
You have to wait for a chance
in this business.

33:35.126 --> 33:36.991
I'll have to wait until i get old.

33:37.094 --> 33:39.654
The best way to make money
is to look for a rich man.

33:39.797 --> 33:41.059
It doesn't matter if he marries me.

33:41.265 --> 33:43.426
As long as he gives me money.

33:43.534 --> 33:45.195
How are we going to spend
a million dollars?

33:45.269 --> 33:46.531
- How will we spend it?
- Listen to me.

33:46.704 --> 33:49.366
I want to buy a race horse
for the Derby.

33:49.507 --> 33:51.566
Then I'll buy a TV station
for my son.

33:51.709 --> 33:55.668
I'll spend the rest on a mistress.

33:56.614 --> 34:00.072
There are a thousand ways
to spend the money.

34:00.217 --> 34:01.878
- Right?
- You're smart.

34:02.753 --> 34:04.414
We've found our targets.

34:04.522 --> 34:05.784
- Are you insane?
- Listen to me.

34:07.124 --> 34:09.489
You're so clumsy. Look at you.

34:09.827 --> 34:10.885
What shall i do?

34:10.995 --> 34:13.759
- Women will suck you dry...
- Come over here.

34:13.864 --> 34:16.025
Mister. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.967
We accidentally spilled coffee
all over our table.

34:19.103 --> 34:20.661
May we join you?

34:20.871 --> 34:23.840
Certainly. It's great...

34:24.041 --> 34:26.509
You don't have to get up.
We'll sit couple to couple.

34:27.011 --> 34:29.672
- Couple to couple?
- Great.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.940
- J.J. they're joining us.
- Thank you.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.745
I'm Sister Veronica.

34:34.918 --> 34:36.681
- I'm Sister Betty.
- How are you?

34:36.887 --> 34:39.856
I'm J.J. and he's my partner, Victor.

34:39.989 --> 34:41.252
We're partners.

34:41.425 --> 34:42.891
Are you two related?

34:43.360 --> 34:45.328
No, we're just business partners.

34:47.797 --> 34:50.062
It's that simple.

34:50.266 --> 34:51.324
And you two?

34:51.534 --> 34:55.494
Betty and i are like real sisters.

34:56.674 --> 34:59.734
What is your occupation?

34:59.944 --> 35:02.708
- We're professional...
- Car racers.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.940
Right. We're in a race today
that's going to the east coast.

35:06.150 --> 35:08.311
Really? Then you'll be rich?

35:11.422 --> 35:13.083
Sure. Which church are you from?

35:13.190 --> 35:15.556
Our church is old and ugly.
We're from...

35:15.726 --> 35:16.784
The Old and Ugly Church.

35:16.861 --> 35:18.328
We and some other sisters

35:18.529 --> 35:20.997
- organized a detox centre...
- It's a community.

35:21.132 --> 35:22.793
It's called
the Desert Detox Community.

35:22.967 --> 35:26.232
- The name sounds strange.
- It's new.

35:26.303 --> 35:27.565
I'm very familiar with the bible,

35:27.738 --> 35:30.707
because i always pray
the night before a race.

35:30.908 --> 35:33.968
l've never heard that name.

35:34.178 --> 35:35.236
You're reading an old version
of the Bible.

35:35.379 --> 35:38.348
Even the teaching material
changes every year.

35:38.449 --> 35:40.610
- Right.
- Is that right?

35:40.785 --> 35:42.548
The Bible has to be updated.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.982
It should be.

35:44.622 --> 35:46.988
We still have work to do.
Let's go. Bye.

35:47.358 --> 35:50.225
- Right, we'll talk later.
- Good.

35:50.628 --> 35:51.890
- Let's go.
- When does the race begin?

35:52.096 --> 35:54.462
- At noon.
- At the hotel entrance.

35:54.632 --> 35:56.395
- Bye, sisters.
- Bye.

35:57.668 --> 35:58.726
Let's go.

35:59.136 --> 36:00.899
- Talk to you later.
- Bye.

36:01.138 --> 36:03.800
- Bye...
- Many people need our help.

36:06.710 --> 36:07.870
Is the problem resolved?

36:08.078 --> 36:11.343
I can solve any problem.

36:11.448 --> 36:13.109
We have the thing planned.

36:13.217 --> 36:14.775
While they are racing,

36:14.919 --> 36:16.978
we will get that Arab.

36:17.121 --> 36:19.885
Are you insane? Kill the Arab?

36:19.990 --> 36:21.855
He is a very rich man.

36:22.059 --> 36:23.219
Yes, i know.

36:23.327 --> 36:26.091
I still owe someone a lot of money.
What time is it now?

36:26.197 --> 36:28.358
I'm in trouble.
I have to pay off my debt tomorrow.

36:28.432 --> 36:31.890
If we catch the Arab,
everything will be solved.

36:32.102 --> 36:35.560
He wants us to think of a way
to catch that Arab.

36:35.706 --> 36:36.764
Why?

36:36.874 --> 36:39.843
Why? lf we have him,

36:40.010 --> 36:42.478
we can extort him.

36:42.713 --> 36:45.580
Don't get mad. i know what to do.

36:45.749 --> 36:47.717
- You really blew me off.
- Good night.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.294
Anna, try it again.

37:18.782 --> 37:20.147
Step on the gas.

37:27.658 --> 37:28.920
Everything is fine.

37:34.632 --> 37:35.997
Do you think those military people

37:36.166 --> 37:38.634
will salute when they see you?

37:41.805 --> 37:43.466
You're cunning.

37:44.375 --> 37:47.344
Jill, Martha, it's great.

37:49.179 --> 37:52.637
J.J. looks cocky.

37:52.816 --> 37:54.579
His partner doesn't look that great.

37:54.752 --> 37:57.516
That fat guy always gets cheated.

37:57.655 --> 37:59.816
Those two can't compare to us.

37:59.924 --> 38:03.189
- Let's check out the other racers.
- All right.

38:05.429 --> 38:06.191
How do i look?

38:06.330 --> 38:09.993
- You look smart and sexy.
- Sexy?

38:12.503 --> 38:15.063
- You too...
- I don't look that great.

38:15.239 --> 38:17.207
- No.
- What's my title?

38:17.341 --> 38:19.002
Landmine soldier.

38:20.778 --> 38:23.542
A solider on the front lines.

38:23.614 --> 38:24.774
- That's brave.
- Right.

38:24.882 --> 38:27.350
J.J., i want a medal.

38:27.518 --> 38:29.782
- A medal?
- I'll look better with one.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.581
All right, you can choose one.

38:31.722 --> 38:34.691
No, i can't take one of yours.

38:34.825 --> 38:35.689
I feel embarrassed.

38:35.859 --> 38:37.121
We're partners. Help yourself.

38:37.294 --> 38:38.454
All right.

38:39.863 --> 38:42.127
That one looks good. Thank you.

38:42.466 --> 38:46.334
You're so generous.
A medal of the highest honour.

38:46.804 --> 38:50.467
Thank you so much. This suits me.

38:50.808 --> 38:53.572
It's beautiful. I really like it.

38:53.744 --> 38:57.305
It looks so shiny under the sun.
Look who it is.

38:57.614 --> 38:58.979
How are you?

38:59.550 --> 39:00.915
- How are you?
- Are you a General?

39:01.118 --> 39:04.485
You're a General. He's a lieutenant.

39:04.989 --> 39:06.047
He's just a soldier.

39:06.156 --> 39:09.819
General, can you help us?

39:09.960 --> 39:11.928
We have an urgent errand
and we have to go to New York.

39:12.129 --> 39:14.393
There are many people
who need our help there.

39:14.531 --> 39:16.499
Can you give us a ride?

39:16.633 --> 39:18.601
It's because our church is poor.

39:18.769 --> 39:21.932
- We can't afford to buy tickets.
- Let's do it.

39:22.639 --> 39:25.403
The other racers
aren't as fast as you.

39:26.143 --> 39:28.407
And you're funny.

39:29.246 --> 39:30.213
Funny?

39:30.381 --> 39:32.941
Yes, you know that we're sisters.

39:33.183 --> 39:35.048
We may look serious,

39:35.285 --> 39:37.344
but we like to relax
when we get the chance.

39:37.521 --> 39:38.385
Relax?

39:38.522 --> 39:40.786
You want to relax?
As you like.

39:40.991 --> 39:43.551
We have to discuss this.

39:43.694 --> 39:45.457
- What are you doing?
- Come over here.

39:45.896 --> 39:46.954
What?

39:47.131 --> 39:48.792
I think you overdid it.

39:49.066 --> 39:51.125
Funny and relaxed.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.962
What's wrong with being relaxed?

39:53.137 --> 39:55.503
- i know.
- Helping people is difficult.

39:55.706 --> 39:57.367
It's a jinx to have nuns
come with us.

39:57.508 --> 39:58.372
Just do something good.

39:58.575 --> 40:00.042
If we let them come with us,

40:00.210 --> 40:02.770
we won't be able to pick up girls.

40:02.946 --> 40:05.915
I know I'm a womanizer.

40:06.050 --> 40:07.813
But if they come with us...

40:07.951 --> 40:11.216
- We can use them as shields.
- All right.

40:17.227 --> 40:18.592
J.J. is the best.

40:19.229 --> 40:20.196
Let's get into the car.

40:20.364 --> 40:22.332
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.897
J.J., you'll go to heaven.

40:25.035 --> 40:26.297
It's an honour for the angels.

40:27.171 --> 40:28.229
The handbag is trendy.

40:28.672 --> 40:30.037
We follow trends, too.

40:31.008 --> 40:33.272
I have to make myself clear.
We're in the military.

40:33.444 --> 40:37.005
We do what we want to do.
Aren't you scared?

40:37.214 --> 40:39.079
- That's all right.
- That's good.

40:40.150 --> 40:41.913
Being a nun is a tough job.

40:42.119 --> 40:43.780
My daughter
doesn't want to become one.

40:46.623 --> 40:47.885
Look who is here.

40:48.492 --> 40:49.857
It's someone famous.

40:50.227 --> 40:53.196
It's General Patent
and General Administrator.

40:56.166 --> 41:00.227
It's better to be a cop
when you're chased by one.

41:00.804 --> 41:01.964
Something's wrong.

41:02.973 --> 41:05.840
Miss, let me tell you.

41:05.943 --> 41:09.504
We were disguised as priests before.
We didn't win.

41:09.646 --> 41:11.614
Disguising yourselves as nuns
won't do you any good.

41:13.750 --> 41:15.217
That's why we're disguised as cops.

41:15.352 --> 41:17.912
We can protect the ladies.

41:18.122 --> 41:23.788
We can also search them.
That's great.

41:23.994 --> 41:25.052
You really have guts.

41:25.329 --> 41:28.196
They're real nuns.

41:28.332 --> 41:29.697
You have to pay them respect.

41:31.401 --> 41:33.266
Watch yourself!

41:51.121 --> 41:52.486
You solve your own problem.

41:52.756 --> 41:54.519
Everybody, come here...

41:54.691 --> 41:57.251
Fenderbaum, Blake, J.J. and fat guy,

41:57.461 --> 42:00.430
come here and listen
to the rules of the race.

42:00.564 --> 42:03.328
Although I'm the prince
of the Falafel family,

42:03.433 --> 42:09.599
I do my business seriously.

42:11.475 --> 42:12.635
Don't laugh...

42:12.809 --> 42:16.370
To encourage this race,

42:16.446 --> 42:19.006
I personally donate a million dollars

42:19.183 --> 42:22.050
as the first prize.

42:22.486 --> 42:24.249
We will be rich.

42:27.558 --> 42:30.322
- Good.
- I wish i had a million dollars.

42:30.427 --> 42:35.296
But i get an advantage
for offering this prize.

42:35.399 --> 42:37.367
I have to be the first one
to start the race.

42:41.371 --> 42:42.929
General, is car racing dangerous?

42:43.073 --> 42:45.132
It's not. It's exciting.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.341
Captain Chaos is back.

42:51.915 --> 42:53.075
How are you?

42:53.383 --> 42:55.943
J.J., I'm here to protect you.
You will win this time.

42:56.086 --> 42:58.850
Ask the nuns to get into the car.
We'll take off now.

42:59.122 --> 43:00.885
Your partner is good at acting.

43:01.625 --> 43:03.991
It's not acting. This is real.

43:05.329 --> 43:06.887
General, you sit in the back.

43:07.064 --> 43:10.124
Sister Betty and l
will sit up front.

43:12.469 --> 43:15.233
- The fat guy is cute.
- Of course.

43:18.141 --> 43:19.904
Don't try to be funny.

43:20.344 --> 43:25.407
Everybody, wish me luck.
I hope all of you fail. Cheers.

44:05.789 --> 44:07.950
Thank you. Goodbye...

44:29.012 --> 44:30.570
Are you out of your mind?

44:30.714 --> 44:33.274
You're blocking the way. Move away!

44:33.417 --> 44:34.679
All right.

45:07.184 --> 45:08.549
Say it again.

45:09.953 --> 45:13.218
You're so stupid. Listen carefully.

45:13.323 --> 45:14.585
Get close to his car.

45:14.691 --> 45:17.159
Press the button at the right time.

45:17.361 --> 45:18.726
The metal hand
clamps onto the car's bumper.

45:18.895 --> 45:21.056
Then i will step on the brake

45:21.164 --> 45:24.429
to stop his car.
Then you go and grab him.

45:25.268 --> 45:27.031
Now do you understand?

45:29.539 --> 45:30.506
I understand.

45:51.161 --> 45:53.322
Attention, there's a cop behind you.

45:53.930 --> 45:55.090
We'll be in trouble.

45:55.298 --> 45:57.266
This doesn't work during the day,
only at night.

45:58.001 --> 45:59.662
Show them what you can do.

46:00.070 --> 46:01.628
The cop is getting closer.

46:04.708 --> 46:06.471
- Everything is ready.
- The jet is ready.

46:17.587 --> 46:20.351
Good, this is great.

46:27.464 --> 46:28.624
They are coming.

46:28.965 --> 46:31.126
Are they here yet?
I am still a bit confused.

46:32.402 --> 46:36.361
It's easy. We'll chase them
and grab their rear bumper.

46:37.140 --> 46:39.301
Watch me. I'm ready. Be careful.

46:39.509 --> 46:41.977
Be calm. Ready. Go.

46:42.512 --> 46:44.173
Press the button...

46:44.614 --> 46:45.672
Press.

46:47.384 --> 46:49.352
The car is shaking,
I can't press the button.

46:49.986 --> 46:52.750
If you're so good,
why don't you do it? Press...

46:55.325 --> 46:58.988
- His car isn't going anywhere.
- Not going anywhere.

47:07.504 --> 47:10.769
The car took off.
We can't even follow them now.

47:24.988 --> 47:26.751
That's cute.

47:43.373 --> 47:44.840
Granny,
do you want a tire change?

47:47.677 --> 47:49.838
Tony, will we make it this time?

47:50.013 --> 47:52.675
Shut up, we've been working together

47:52.849 --> 47:54.316
for a long time,
have we ever failed?

47:59.890 --> 48:01.551
The control panel

48:01.658 --> 48:04.422
in this helicopter
has been improved.

48:06.196 --> 48:09.563
Your body may be intact
after a car accident,

48:09.666 --> 48:12.134
but you'll be minced meat
in a helicopter accident.

48:16.139 --> 48:19.597
Shut up.
Keep reading the instructions.

48:20.010 --> 48:22.570
If you want to live, read louder.

48:40.630 --> 48:42.097
We made it.

48:42.432 --> 48:44.297
But you're so scared
your hair is standing on end.

48:44.601 --> 48:47.069
Can you explain to me
how to catch him?

48:47.404 --> 48:48.166
Why?

48:48.305 --> 48:50.466
This is too complicated.
One explanation isn't enough.

48:50.874 --> 48:53.035
You are as dumb as a pig.

48:53.243 --> 48:57.202
Listen, we have a magnet.
It can even pick up a truck.

48:58.181 --> 48:59.842
Is it that powerful?

49:04.421 --> 49:06.184
We are driving really fast.
Are we speeding?

49:06.389 --> 49:08.550
Yes. We are going 110 m.p.h.

49:11.127 --> 49:12.788
It is really exciting.

49:13.063 --> 49:14.621
Are you touching my thigh?

49:16.032 --> 49:17.294
Yes.

49:20.470 --> 49:22.438
It's all right. Please continue.

49:27.510 --> 49:28.772
We have just passed a cop.

49:28.979 --> 49:30.446
It doesn't matter.
Just pretend we didn't see him.

49:31.114 --> 49:32.775
Sir, how fast are you driving?

49:32.882 --> 49:35.544
About 80 m.p.h.

49:35.719 --> 49:37.687
They just passed us.

49:37.887 --> 49:39.650
We have to give them a ticket.

49:39.990 --> 49:41.855
Watch me. You're still a rookie.

49:42.025 --> 49:45.085
So you've never been involved
in a real car chase.

49:47.564 --> 49:49.327
Oh no. The cops are behind us.

49:50.433 --> 49:52.901
They just want my autograph.

49:57.707 --> 50:00.801
What is wrong? What happened?

50:00.877 --> 50:03.243
I am afraid of the cops.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.347
You are afraid?

50:06.683 --> 50:09.243
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

50:09.419 --> 50:12.286
I am counting on you.
Your hands are warm.

50:12.455 --> 50:14.218
They are steaming hot.

50:14.758 --> 50:17.522
- His whole body is very warm.
- Is that right?

50:17.661 --> 50:21.119
You know what?
Fatty's thigh is warm, too.

50:23.733 --> 50:24.995
There is a technigue to speeding.

50:25.135 --> 50:27.103
Going in the same direction

50:27.270 --> 50:29.738
will give you 20 m.p.h. more,
even when making a turn.

50:48.591 --> 50:49.649
What are you writing?

50:49.793 --> 50:50.953
My resignation letter.

51:02.205 --> 51:03.467
It is lunch time, Prince.

51:03.907 --> 51:05.772
You will get a stomach ache
if you eat too much.

51:05.942 --> 51:09.708
Let me have some.
I will have the stomach ache instead.

51:15.151 --> 51:16.709
His car is ahead of us.

51:16.853 --> 51:18.013
I see it.

51:22.225 --> 51:23.886
This is getting exciting.

51:24.094 --> 51:25.959
What do we do now?

51:26.362 --> 51:28.728
Of course, we will follow it.

51:28.898 --> 51:30.263
When they are not looking,

51:30.400 --> 51:33.267
we will use the magnet
to pick the car up.

51:33.369 --> 51:34.836
It's better than using super glue.

51:35.004 --> 51:38.462
That is great, Tony.
I have faith in you.

51:38.641 --> 51:40.700
I have to be 100%   certain.

51:41.377 --> 51:42.742
That is good.

51:44.013 --> 51:45.275
Do you think we are too low?

51:45.815 --> 51:46.782
You don't understand.

51:47.951 --> 51:49.111
We are almost touching the car.

51:49.285 --> 51:50.946
Don't you think i know that?

51:54.357 --> 51:59.624
Go left. A bit left.

51:59.729 --> 52:02.994
Stop mumbling in my ear.
I know what to do.

52:03.066 --> 52:04.328
Go a bit lower.

52:05.301 --> 52:06.666
Lower the magnet.

52:08.404 --> 52:10.065
It sticks like super glue.

52:14.310 --> 52:19.771
It's so tight,
nothing can break it apart.

52:21.351 --> 52:25.014
Let's fly into the sky...

52:27.891 --> 52:31.156
Let's fly into the sky.

52:34.831 --> 52:36.196
How come it is not working?

52:36.733 --> 52:37.995
Do you think the fan belt is broken?

52:39.569 --> 52:42.834
Is it too light?
Is that why it won't work?

52:43.573 --> 52:47.942
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

52:49.445 --> 52:51.913
I think we will have to wear
our seatbelts.

53:19.142 --> 53:20.404
It is lunch time.

53:21.344 --> 53:23.209
You feed him. Let me drive.

53:23.379 --> 53:25.939
No. It is your turn. Hurry up.

53:29.152 --> 53:30.210
This is for you.

53:31.788 --> 53:34.655
What are you doing, monkey?

53:34.858 --> 53:37.918
That monkey is crazy.
It should be sent to a clinic.

53:43.499 --> 53:49.563
London Bridge is falling down,
falling down...

53:52.475 --> 53:54.033
- Soldier.
- Yes, sir?

53:54.143 --> 53:55.508
- You're driving well.
- Thank you, Sir.

53:55.712 --> 53:56.770
Keep up the good work.

53:58.147 --> 54:02.607
Sister Betty,
I am familiar with the Bible.

54:02.719 --> 54:05.984
Why haven't i heard about
the Desert Detox Community?

54:06.222 --> 54:08.190
- It has to do with morality.
- Morality?

54:08.391 --> 54:10.359
She doesn't have a good memory.

54:12.061 --> 54:16.521
- We want to rest now.
- Go ahead.

54:16.833 --> 54:19.301
If you don't mind,
we have to change.

54:19.369 --> 54:22.338
Please go ahead. Don't be shy.

54:22.472 --> 54:24.133
Goodnight.

54:31.114 --> 54:34.880
I think they're open-minded.

54:34.984 --> 54:36.645
It's nice that they're open-minded.

54:37.086 --> 54:40.954
Nice?
I can't control myself anymore.

54:41.958 --> 54:44.017
J.J., you have to control yourself.

54:44.193 --> 54:46.058
It's very difficult. They always...

54:46.195 --> 54:49.653
They're religious.
You have a dirty mind.

54:54.404 --> 54:56.372
- They're nuns.
- They're women, too.

54:56.472 --> 54:58.633
I don't know what to say to you.

55:00.276 --> 55:03.336
I can't stop fantasizing
about those girls.

55:07.517 --> 55:08.677
J.J.

55:09.986 --> 55:11.954
Please forgive me, God.
I have sinned.

55:26.469 --> 55:28.835
Good morning, Officer.
Nice day, isn't it?

55:28.938 --> 55:33.102
- Don't sweet talk me. Step aside.
- All right.

55:37.547 --> 55:39.515
- Good morning.
- General?

55:41.384 --> 55:42.851
What's the matter, Officer?

55:43.419 --> 55:45.580
Nothing, your car
was over the speed limit.

55:45.989 --> 55:47.650
It's a military emergency.

55:48.157 --> 55:49.317
How urgent is it?

55:49.892 --> 55:51.154
It's highly confidential.

55:51.928 --> 55:52.792
Where is your driver's license?

55:52.962 --> 55:55.522
Stop.
I'm contaminated with radiation.

55:57.867 --> 55:59.630
Do you think I'm an idiot?

55:59.836 --> 56:01.201
There was a nuclear radiation leak.

56:01.771 --> 56:04.239
We have to take the leaky object
to the next state.

56:04.707 --> 56:05.867
Why?

56:08.244 --> 56:09.506
To store it in a warehouse.

56:10.780 --> 56:12.338
This is nonsense.

56:14.183 --> 56:15.241
Hey, Brother-in-law!

56:15.551 --> 56:17.018
That's my wife's brother.

56:17.286 --> 56:19.151
- Go ahead. We'll wait for you.
- Thank you.

56:19.255 --> 56:21.018
Long time no see...

56:21.157 --> 56:23.125
- I didn't know you're coming back.
- Private.

56:25.294 --> 56:26.454
General.

56:27.430 --> 56:28.795
Why are you here?

56:28.898 --> 56:32.459
I'm on vacation.
I haven't had one in 10 years.

56:33.436 --> 56:35.996
I order you to drive this car
to the next state.

56:36.272 --> 56:38.035
- Go and drive.
- Yes, Sir.

56:38.141 --> 56:41.406
Wait a minute.
I have to check it out first.

56:41.811 --> 56:44.279
His rank is higher.
I have to listen to him.

56:44.414 --> 56:46.075
See how many medals he has.

56:46.349 --> 56:48.909
I don't care. I have to check.

56:50.920 --> 56:52.581
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Officer.

56:53.089 --> 56:54.249
What's going on?

56:54.357 --> 56:55.619
General, what happened?

56:55.725 --> 56:56.783
I'm sorry, Sisters.

56:56.926 --> 56:59.690
I tried to explain everything
to the officer.

57:00.430 --> 57:01.692
Why are these nuns with you?

57:01.998 --> 57:06.560
- Just in case we die while on duty.
- This is serious.

57:06.769 --> 57:08.532
The mission is called ''God Knows''.

57:08.638 --> 57:10.503
We have to keep this top secret.

57:10.706 --> 57:14.472
If we don't complete this mission,
the U.S. may be destroyed.

57:15.344 --> 57:17.107
You have to be careful.

57:17.580 --> 57:21.744
ln that case,
I will escort you to the border.

57:22.018 --> 57:23.076
God bless you.

57:23.186 --> 57:24.744
Officer, i have to tell you.

57:24.921 --> 57:27.685
There are two spies
disguised as cops.

57:27.824 --> 57:32.090
They're following us in a red car.
They're spies.

57:32.762 --> 57:35.230
- Is that true?
- It's true.

57:38.401 --> 57:40.961
Attention, there's a message
from the General.

57:41.104 --> 57:44.665
Two spies disguised as cops
are driving a red car.

57:44.740 --> 57:46.708
They are trying to steal
our nuclear waste.

57:46.943 --> 57:50.003
If you see them, stop them.

57:50.413 --> 57:51.880
Do you understand?

57:54.717 --> 57:57.083
Units Two and Five
are heading east.

57:57.186 --> 57:59.347
We saw the spies.

57:59.822 --> 58:00.982
Spies?

58:01.557 --> 58:04.822
l've always been mistaken by others,
but never for a spy.

58:05.061 --> 58:07.120
Do they think i am James Bond?

58:07.597 --> 58:10.862
Report to the General.
The spies won't get away.

58:13.436 --> 58:15.700
Report to the General.
What General?

58:16.739 --> 58:21.301
It's that jerk, J.J.,
he's playing a trick on us.

58:30.553 --> 58:34.216
Good work.
But we're not free yet.

58:34.457 --> 58:37.017
Units Two and Five
are heading west.

58:38.027 --> 58:39.289
This is the Captain.

58:39.428 --> 58:42.488
Capture them. Dead or alive.

58:43.199 --> 58:46.066
We will have to take a chance.

58:46.269 --> 58:47.531
I am going to place the car
in the middle of the road.

58:47.670 --> 58:50.639
So they will be blocked.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.808
If they have the guts,
they will hit us.

58:52.975 --> 58:56.035
Or else they'll go into the ditch.

58:56.112 --> 58:58.376
Let's do that. Speed up.

58:59.081 --> 59:00.548
If they have the guts,

59:00.983 --> 59:02.644
we'll be minced meat if they hit us.

59:02.818 --> 59:03.682
That's right.

59:20.570 --> 59:24.438
Don't throw that, stupid monkey.

59:25.808 --> 59:29.369
I hate sitting up here.
I am bored.

59:29.812 --> 59:34.078
Do you think i enjoy
sitting back here? Stupid monkey.

59:36.385 --> 59:38.649
I won't be easy on you
if you keep on throwing stuff.

59:49.665 --> 59:52.532
- Why are you out here?
- It is safer here.

59:54.070 --> 59:56.231
- Who is driving?
- He is.

01:00:08.351 --> 01:00:11.115
Do you want to take me to a disco?

01:00:11.287 --> 01:00:13.255
I haven't put on my dancing shoes.

01:00:22.298 --> 01:00:23.765
- Blake.
- What?

01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:25.128
It's the General's car.

01:00:25.568 --> 01:00:26.830
Is the fat guy driving?

01:00:28.104 --> 01:00:31.164
No, the General is driving.

01:00:31.274 --> 01:00:33.139
The General is driving.

01:00:33.376 --> 01:00:36.834
I am going to teach him a lesson.

01:00:44.954 --> 01:00:49.118
We're going to win this time
and get the prize.

01:00:52.795 --> 01:00:56.458
You have to trust me.
You won't forget this experience.

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:59.065
- Will we have fun together?
- Yes.

01:01:00.436 --> 01:01:04.497
You'll be proud
to tell your grandchildren.

01:01:04.674 --> 01:01:07.040
If you crash the car,

01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:08.837
I will never forget the experience.

01:01:09.278 --> 01:01:10.438
That won't happen.

01:01:10.613 --> 01:01:14.379
We will be gentle with it.

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.108
Do you think you can handle
the both of us?

01:01:19.955 --> 01:01:21.718
- All right.
- We got it...

01:01:21.924 --> 01:01:23.892
The keys are in the car.
Don't mess around.

01:01:24.026 --> 01:01:26.586
Or else my friends will laugh at me.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:28.797
They will envy you.

01:01:29.031 --> 01:01:32.091
- Really?
- Drink more milk for energy.

01:01:32.368 --> 01:01:33.528
Really?

01:01:39.475 --> 01:01:41.238
Is the tank full?

01:01:41.344 --> 01:01:43.403
Please drive carefully.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.538
Bye, handsome.

01:02:01.797 --> 01:02:04.664
Look at that fat guy.

01:02:12.141 --> 01:02:13.403
What are you doing?

01:02:17.513 --> 01:02:19.071
What do you want?

01:02:28.357 --> 01:02:29.619
Give me a hand.

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.851
Why do i have to?
I am not involved in this.

01:02:32.061 --> 01:02:33.824
Help me cut this. Come on.

01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:38.195
- Thank you.
- You don't have team spirit.

01:02:56.886 --> 01:02:58.251
I will help you later.

01:03:09.932 --> 01:03:11.695
Did i scare you? Are you all right?

01:03:11.834 --> 01:03:13.802
Don't be afraid.
I will protect you.

01:03:13.936 --> 01:03:15.995
Can we go for a ride later?

01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:24.370
This is the first time
l've been rescued.

01:03:24.547 --> 01:03:27.107
Please stay for dinner
and meet my parents.

01:03:27.516 --> 01:03:29.074
- You're great.
- You're so capable.

01:03:29.118 --> 01:03:30.380
- It's wonderful.
- Please, don't mention it.

01:03:30.586 --> 01:03:31.644
What's your name?

01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:32.821
I'm Jack...

01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:34.923
We still have to finish the race.

01:03:35.024 --> 01:03:36.491
A million dollar prize
is waiting for us.

01:03:36.692 --> 01:03:37.954
No, she and i are...

01:03:38.227 --> 01:03:40.195
Don't forget me when you get rich.

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:44.025
When i am rich, i will come back.

01:03:47.203 --> 01:03:48.465
Why are they taking so long?

01:03:51.273 --> 01:03:53.833
They look great. They have changed.

01:03:56.679 --> 01:03:59.842
- Are we too sexy?
- Maybe.

01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:04.109
I am afraid we may scare them.

01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:07.585
General, you have two pretty women
for this task.

01:04:07.723 --> 01:04:10.692
I guess the mission
must be very important.

01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:21.465
All right, we have enough food.
We don't have to worry.

01:04:22.738 --> 01:04:26.196
You won't starve.

01:04:38.254 --> 01:04:41.314
You look great out of your outfit.

01:04:47.863 --> 01:04:50.423
They're beautiful.
Private, come with me.

01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:54.133
Disguised as nuns, huh?

01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:58.473
Get into the car, guickly.

01:04:59.542 --> 01:05:03.410
Yes, General.

01:05:21.497 --> 01:05:25.365
What are you doing?
We don't need a gun.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.506
Turn right...

01:05:35.744 --> 01:05:41.205
We'll use the wire to stop the car.
Then you steal the money.

01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:43.885
- I steal the money?
- I will kidnap the Prince.

01:05:44.053 --> 01:05:47.113
After that,
we will go back to Las Vegas.

01:05:47.289 --> 01:05:48.551
Let's do it.

01:05:50.092 --> 01:05:51.559
This is Falafel.

01:05:52.561 --> 01:05:55.826
Did you get it? Doubtful?

01:05:56.165 --> 01:05:57.530
What a name for a company.

01:05:58.634 --> 01:06:01.501
The name doesn't sound good,
but go ahead and buy it.

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.639
Use another name
to make birth control pills.

01:06:04.773 --> 01:06:07.640
I am going to buy. That is it.

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.473
Do you understand?

01:06:10.779 --> 01:06:13.247
I can't hear you. Speak up a bit.

01:06:13.449 --> 01:06:15.314
I said,
do you still have a stomach ache?

01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:18.384
- Thank you.
- It is a deal. Bye.

01:06:26.495 --> 01:06:27.757
What happened?

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:33.495
- They are coming. Make it tighter.
- I know.

01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:36.430
- I have tried my best.
- They are coming...

01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:52.079
What lousy luck!

01:06:53.656 --> 01:06:55.214
This car is like a toy. I am so mad!

01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:57.655
You get what you pay for.

01:06:57.926 --> 01:06:59.188
- What shall we do?
- I don't know.

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:03.191
Go and flirt with someone
so they can fix it.

01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:22.150
They are getting intimate.

01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:25.053
It is a real show.

01:07:39.168 --> 01:07:43.332
The car just suddenly stopped.

01:07:43.505 --> 01:07:46.474
It looks like there is a gas leak.

01:07:47.376 --> 01:07:48.741
It is here.

01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:50.938
This isn't the gear box.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.741
What gear box?

01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:54.143
Can you fix it?

01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:57.614
I am a car repair expert.

01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:00.481
Really?

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:18.139
How powerful is your truck?

01:08:18.474 --> 01:08:21.932
It is eguipped with a jet engine.

01:08:22.111 --> 01:08:24.875
- The horsepower is second to none.
- Really?

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.546
It doesn't look bad.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:32.145
It is so hot.

01:08:34.089 --> 01:08:35.852
It is really hot.

01:08:40.362 --> 01:08:43.421
Sonny, believe me,
I won't trick you.

01:08:44.066 --> 01:08:47.126
If my boss knows i am speeding,
he will yell at me.

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:49.134
How will he know?

01:08:49.638 --> 01:08:51.697
How about this?
Why don't you take me back first?

01:08:51.907 --> 01:08:56.276
Let me explain to my boss.
Or else i will be fired.

01:09:02.451 --> 01:09:05.511
Forget it. I don't care.

01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:09.388
We will make this trip unforgettable.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.663
Attention, a cop is approaching...

01:09:22.805 --> 01:09:24.272
We have to race them.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:28.600
- Use the jet.
- All right.

01:09:30.546 --> 01:09:32.604
The jet is ready, 3, 2, 1.

01:09:32.747 --> 01:09:34.716
- Ready.
- Go.

01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:47.326
- Turn it off.
- Why?

01:09:47.496 --> 01:09:48.861
Turn it off.

01:09:50.799 --> 01:09:53.267
We're going into the water.

01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:10.584
There is nothing we can do.

01:10:28.537 --> 01:10:30.903
Look, beer cans.

01:10:32.107 --> 01:10:34.075
- Release the oil.
- All right.

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:41.442
There is an oil leak.

01:10:41.817 --> 01:10:44.684
They caused the accident.
We had nothing to do with it.

01:10:44.786 --> 01:10:46.151
I am sorry.

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:51.824
Attention...

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.927
What is the matter now?

01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:09.642
Turn off the engine.

01:11:11.546 --> 01:11:12.808
Keep guiet.

01:11:12.948 --> 01:11:15.007
Underwater operations. Ready.

01:11:17.219 --> 01:11:18.379
It is all right.

01:11:24.559 --> 01:11:26.925
You have to have patience
to catch a big fish.

01:11:27.062 --> 01:11:29.121
- I have been waiting for 5 years.
- It is been that long?

01:11:29.298 --> 01:11:31.163
That is why you have to be guiet.

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:33.699
- How do you know?
- From experience.

01:11:33.835 --> 01:11:36.895
When my wife is home, i hide.

01:11:37.306 --> 01:11:39.774
I saw a big fish recently.

01:11:40.776 --> 01:11:43.244
He must be drunk.

01:11:49.751 --> 01:11:51.616
Highway 40 is up ahead.

01:11:51.787 --> 01:11:53.049
Go at full speed.

01:12:12.174 --> 01:12:15.143
Speak of the devil. You see.
I caught a big fish.

01:12:15.377 --> 01:12:18.039
- I caught a fish.
- That is great.

01:12:21.383 --> 01:12:23.044
Going at full speed.

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:29.486
Look, smoke is coming out of it.

01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:31.056
The fish must be big. Don't let go!

01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:33.022
That fish must weigh
a few hundred pounds.

01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:35.291
Hold on tight. Don't let go!

01:12:43.105 --> 01:12:44.970
It must be fun to be in the army.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.800
It's not bad when you're not at war.

01:12:48.543 --> 01:12:49.908
- General.
- What is the matter?

01:12:50.412 --> 01:12:52.073
Since our mission is dangerous,

01:12:52.147 --> 01:12:55.116
why don't we let the Private go?

01:12:56.051 --> 01:12:56.915
I will consider it.

01:12:57.052 --> 01:12:59.020
His girlfriend is waiting for him.

01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:01.487
- J.J., let him go.
- Well...

01:13:01.656 --> 01:13:03.021
This is inhumane.

01:13:03.258 --> 01:13:05.920
I'll break the rules just this once.
Watch me.

01:13:06.461 --> 01:13:07.826
- Private.
- Yes, Sir?

01:13:08.497 --> 01:13:09.862
You have done well.

01:13:10.699 --> 01:13:13.167
ln order not to disappoint
your girlfriend,

01:13:14.036 --> 01:13:17.199
l've decided to let you go home.
Stop the car.

01:13:17.406 --> 01:13:18.566
Yes, Sir.

01:13:40.662 --> 01:13:41.924
Listen to me.

01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:44.594
I really appreciate your attitude.

01:13:44.766 --> 01:13:48.327
Your performance shows
that you are a patriot.

01:13:48.703 --> 01:13:52.366
l've decided to give you a medal
of the highest honour.

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:59.178
- My medal?
- That is right. Your medal.

01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:11.216
- Then i won't have any.
- Shut up.

01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:15.630
General, i have taken
my driving test 30 times.

01:14:15.797 --> 01:14:17.162
I am delighted
that i have gained your trust

01:14:17.332 --> 01:14:18.594
to be your driver.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.859
I am really honoured.

01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:36.550
Goodbye.

01:14:57.506 --> 01:14:58.871
This time we can't go wrong.

01:14:59.074 --> 01:15:02.532
It is hard to find a partner
who can fly.

01:15:02.677 --> 01:15:04.645
You are flying now.

01:15:04.846 --> 01:15:07.212
- Read the landing instructions.
- All right.

01:15:10.118 --> 01:15:12.086
It says to lower the flaps.

01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:15.114
- Why don't you lower the flaps?
- Where are they?

01:15:15.423 --> 01:15:17.983
On the right side...stupid.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.821
There are 40 buttons.
They are all numbered.

01:15:19.995 --> 01:15:21.257
Which one do i press?

01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:22.558
Choose anyone.

01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:25.097
- An even or odd number?
- It is up to you.

01:15:49.624 --> 01:15:52.184
I am writing a song.
I am better than Quincy Jones.

01:15:56.498 --> 01:15:59.558
I don't understand.
I though flying was difficult?

01:16:00.202 --> 01:16:01.669
We can't fail this time.

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.532
I just spoke with Don Don.
He is mad.

01:16:05.974 --> 01:16:07.532
Don't worry.

01:16:08.476 --> 01:16:11.240
The easiest way is the best way.

01:16:11.346 --> 01:16:12.813
No problem.

01:16:13.515 --> 01:16:14.379
Really?

01:16:16.051 --> 01:16:18.212
Relax, all right?

01:16:23.525 --> 01:16:26.892
I am starting to have stomach ache.
Do you have any painkillers?

01:16:28.396 --> 01:16:30.364
This is a new product.

01:16:31.399 --> 01:16:36.462
It is slimy,
but it is better than an injection.

01:16:51.253 --> 01:16:52.914
I guess it is fate.

01:16:53.622 --> 01:16:55.590
This is a product of Allah.

01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:58.255
A pretty girl
standing by the side of the road

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.827
is a waste.

01:17:00.295 --> 01:17:02.263
Why don't you come home with me?

01:17:02.631 --> 01:17:04.895
I am the famous prince
of the Falafel family.

01:17:04.966 --> 01:17:06.228
My family is rich.

01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:08.029
You will enjoy luxury
if you come with me.

01:17:08.136 --> 01:17:12.596
After probation, you can be my...

01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:13.901
Seventieth wife.

01:17:14.075 --> 01:17:16.441
I hate people pointing guns at me.

01:17:19.681 --> 01:17:23.048
If you do well,
you will get promoted.

01:17:27.889 --> 01:17:29.151
This is fun. Did we make you horny?

01:17:29.324 --> 01:17:30.689
Especially when we got changed?

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:32.157
Did you guys get horny?

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.728
It was all Betty's idea.

01:17:34.863 --> 01:17:36.922
We are always dressed up.

01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:38.728
We didn't expect you to believe us.

01:17:38.967 --> 01:17:40.127
We are very innocent.

01:17:40.335 --> 01:17:44.601
We were afraid
that you would kick us out.

01:17:45.974 --> 01:17:47.236
How could l?

01:17:50.412 --> 01:17:52.471
We did it to make money.

01:17:53.315 --> 01:17:55.180
Who wouldn't want to?

01:17:57.452 --> 01:17:58.714
Let me kiss you.

01:17:58.887 --> 01:18:01.253
I have been waiting for this
for a long time.

01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:14.831
I hate giving out speeding tickets.

01:18:15.036 --> 01:18:17.800
Especially to big shots.

01:18:22.277 --> 01:18:23.642
I have to give you a ticket...

01:18:26.681 --> 01:18:28.046
Don't mess around.

01:18:32.487 --> 01:18:33.749
Why did you kiss that monkey?

01:18:33.955 --> 01:18:36.822
That car is a bit strange.
Go and check it out.

01:18:37.592 --> 01:18:38.957
I know. This must be Candid Camera.

01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:40.061
Don't look!

01:18:40.228 --> 01:18:43.493
The program
that plays tricks on people.

01:18:43.698 --> 01:18:46.064
- We are on TV now.
- We are going to be movie stars.

01:18:46.267 --> 01:18:48.735
Go back and be smart.
Stand straight, hurry.

01:18:49.904 --> 01:18:51.565
Be calm. Be more expressive.

01:18:51.706 --> 01:18:53.571
Come on...you can do better.

01:18:54.242 --> 01:18:56.005
I am sorry. Can i have your license?

01:19:02.984 --> 01:19:05.248
He hit a cop. He will go to jail.

01:19:06.721 --> 01:19:08.279
He thinks we are playing with him.

01:19:10.725 --> 01:19:12.283
Don't mess around.
Don't make him angry.

01:19:18.032 --> 01:19:19.693
You have to take it
if you want to be a star.

01:19:20.502 --> 01:19:22.868
I have had acting classes.
I know how to act.

01:19:26.474 --> 01:19:27.236
How was it?

01:19:27.409 --> 01:19:28.671
I think it is better
if we sing him a song.

01:19:28.843 --> 01:19:30.208
Get up and sing.

01:19:30.378 --> 01:19:31.936
Get up and work hard.

01:19:38.787 --> 01:19:40.550
We should go now,
or else we will be arrested.

01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:45.751
We haven't finished yet.
Shouldn't we get paid?

01:19:45.894 --> 01:19:47.953
Forget it. Let's go.

01:19:52.233 --> 01:19:53.700
Be guiet. Look.

01:19:54.335 --> 01:19:55.996
Why is everyone stopped there?

01:20:05.513 --> 01:20:07.481
What is going on? What happened?

01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:10.310
When i took some medicine,

01:20:10.351 --> 01:20:13.912
a pretty girl suddenly appeared.

01:20:14.155 --> 01:20:15.417
Actually, it was nothing.

01:20:15.623 --> 01:20:18.888
Falafel was kidnapped.
And the money was robbed.

01:20:19.761 --> 01:20:20.819
How did it happen?

01:20:20.962 --> 01:20:22.623
A pretty girl wanted to hitch a ride.

01:20:22.797 --> 01:20:24.560
Being nice guys, we stopped the car.

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:26.531
- God knows...
- That is impossible.

01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:28.464
No one knows
where the money was kept.

01:20:28.603 --> 01:20:30.662
Someone in this group
gave away the secret.

01:20:31.139 --> 01:20:32.800
He is right. No one else knew

01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:35.000
there was so much cash involved,
except us.

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:43.708
J.J.

01:20:44.552 --> 01:20:48.318
You two better talk.

01:20:48.523 --> 01:20:51.788
- How?
- Say it.

01:20:52.727 --> 01:20:54.592
J.J., this is simple.

01:20:55.763 --> 01:20:59.927
We owe a casino for a small amount.

01:21:00.869 --> 01:21:04.236
They were being cautious,
so they sent some collectors.

01:21:05.907 --> 01:21:07.568
You told them the secret.

01:21:08.343 --> 01:21:10.106
We didn't mean to.

01:21:10.278 --> 01:21:11.643
Who are they?

01:21:11.846 --> 01:21:14.508
They are friends
of the Godfather's son, Don Don.

01:21:14.649 --> 01:21:16.412
We have to find them
and discuss this.

01:21:16.651 --> 01:21:18.312
- That may work.
- It is not going to work.

01:21:18.419 --> 01:21:19.181
Why?

01:21:19.254 --> 01:21:20.312
Because the Pinto Ranch
is heavily guarded.

01:21:20.555 --> 01:21:22.716
It is not easy to get in.

01:21:23.391 --> 01:21:25.655
They can't scare us if i am here.

01:21:25.927 --> 01:21:27.394
You, Captain Chaos, go in.

01:21:27.595 --> 01:21:30.462
And you will end up not coming out.

01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:32.927
What else can we do?

01:21:33.034 --> 01:21:34.899
What is wrong?
Why are there so many people?

01:21:35.637 --> 01:21:37.298
We have to rescue the Prince
as soon as we can.

01:21:37.405 --> 01:21:38.565
He is probably fooling around
with some girls.

01:21:38.673 --> 01:21:41.540
He is going to be drained.

01:21:41.743 --> 01:21:44.906
I have a solution.
I can go to my old friend.

01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:48.146
He is a bad guy.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:52.408
It doesn't matter who he is
if he can help us.

01:21:53.688 --> 01:21:55.155
He is waiting for you.

01:22:09.003 --> 01:22:10.265
Sit here.

01:22:12.674 --> 01:22:14.539
Every time you come here,
it is bad news.

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:17.175
- You are bright.
- Right...

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.545
All right, how much do you want?

01:22:21.215 --> 01:22:23.979
We are not here
to ask you for money.

01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:27.514
We just need your help.

01:22:27.989 --> 01:22:30.150
Who told you to sit down.
Stand up.

01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:34.025
Mr. Sinatra.

01:22:34.195 --> 01:22:35.560
Call me Frank.

01:22:36.164 --> 01:22:37.324
I am really honoured.

01:22:37.999 --> 01:22:41.366
Hold on.
Let me take a good look at you guys.

01:22:41.469 --> 01:22:42.629
Don't try to be too cute with me.

01:22:42.804 --> 01:22:43.771
How should i address you?

01:22:43.938 --> 01:22:45.098
Call me, ''Sir''.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.803
- Call him, ''Sir''.
- I know.

01:22:48.309 --> 01:22:51.574
Sir, we are Cannonball racers.

01:22:51.779 --> 01:22:54.247
- What?
- Cannonball car racers.

01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:58.113
We have something in common.

01:22:58.319 --> 01:23:01.083
I like car racing, too.

01:23:02.924 --> 01:23:05.085
You are lucky
we have that in common.

01:23:05.293 --> 01:23:06.055
Sir.

01:23:06.294 --> 01:23:07.955
Sir, our race goes
from the west coast

01:23:08.162 --> 01:23:09.527
to the east coast.

01:23:09.631 --> 01:23:13.089
- During the race, Falafel...
- Falafel?

01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:15.166
Right, he is an Arab prince.

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.133
I know a lot of Arab princes.

01:23:17.238 --> 01:23:18.603
He could be your friend.

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:22.005
Someone kidnapped him
and stole his million dollars.

01:23:22.176 --> 01:23:23.643
That is why we are here
for your help.

01:23:24.312 --> 01:23:26.177
You should go to the FBl.

01:23:26.814 --> 01:23:28.873
You are better than the FBl.

01:23:32.186 --> 01:23:33.653
All right, tell me what you want.

01:23:33.855 --> 01:23:34.822
What is his background?

01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:37.157
He is the former Godfather's son.

01:23:39.861 --> 01:23:41.021
I have an idea.

01:23:41.763 --> 01:23:43.526
He's wanted to hire my performers
for a long time.

01:23:43.665 --> 01:23:45.326
I can introduce you to him.

01:23:48.803 --> 01:23:51.169
Anna, get me Don Don.

01:23:54.876 --> 01:23:56.844
Frank introduced me
to other performers,

01:23:57.011 --> 01:23:58.171
but they weren't very good.

01:23:58.279 --> 01:23:59.337
Maybe not.

01:23:59.447 --> 01:24:01.813
I guarantee you,
these girls will surprise you.

01:24:02.016 --> 01:24:04.576
Believe me. I am not bragging.

01:24:04.752 --> 01:24:07.812
Really? Let me meet them.

01:24:08.056 --> 01:24:09.523
Let's see the guality.

01:24:44.525 --> 01:24:45.992
What is the matter?

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.321
They are the ugliest group so far.

01:24:49.063 --> 01:24:52.521
You can't define art
by its appearance.

01:25:07.982 --> 01:25:09.643
They are not bad.

01:25:40.148 --> 01:25:43.413
Frank knows his stuff.

01:25:43.518 --> 01:25:46.078
He keeps the good ones to himself.

01:25:51.592 --> 01:25:52.752
Thank you.

01:26:01.636 --> 01:26:04.400
Great. You got the contract.

01:26:04.505 --> 01:26:07.269
It is an irrevocable contract.

01:26:07.441 --> 01:26:08.806
It will be extended to 1997.

01:26:09.043 --> 01:26:11.511
Nothing will be changed.
Let's get changed.

01:26:12.313 --> 01:26:13.780
Go...and get changed backstage.

01:26:13.981 --> 01:26:16.643
But don't remove your make-up.

01:26:16.784 --> 01:26:18.251
Do this favour for Frank.

01:26:18.452 --> 01:26:19.919
Don't argue with him.

01:26:25.593 --> 01:26:26.958
The bully is here.

01:26:43.644 --> 01:26:47.011
We will pay you
after signing the contracts.

01:26:47.148 --> 01:26:48.308
Great...

01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:51.311
Hey, what a pleasant surprise?

01:26:57.158 --> 01:26:59.524
What surprise?

01:27:01.596 --> 01:27:04.861
I told you I'd be here
to get my money.

01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:08.760
If you don't have the money,
you are dead.

01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:10.732
May l?

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.303
On no...

01:27:27.455 --> 01:27:29.116
Are they here to help you?

01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:31.048
They are dancers.

01:27:31.225 --> 01:27:34.194
Dancers?
Is the audience blind?

01:27:34.595 --> 01:27:35.653
It is a joke.

01:27:37.331 --> 01:27:38.992
How are you? Boss.

01:27:41.168 --> 01:27:44.137
- Shouldn't you shave?
- We try to be fair to the guys.

01:27:44.939 --> 01:27:47.407
I take too many birth control pills.

01:27:48.276 --> 01:27:51.939
You have to take them?
You could promote vasectomies.

01:27:53.581 --> 01:27:55.344
I am Laverne.

01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:04.248
- Keep an eye on them.
- All right.

01:28:06.427 --> 01:28:09.590
Dumb-Dumb,
do you have the money?

01:28:11.933 --> 01:28:13.594
I have a million in cash.

01:28:13.668 --> 01:28:17.627
I have some guys getting the rest.

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.305
This is just the interest.

01:28:20.474 --> 01:28:22.533
When are you going to pay
the remaining balance?

01:28:24.312 --> 01:28:26.576
All right, i will wait one more day.

01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:30.740
If you don't have it by then,
dig yourself a grave.

01:28:33.254 --> 01:28:35.415
Bye, everyone.

01:28:35.656 --> 01:28:37.419
Come again.

01:28:39.794 --> 01:28:42.558
Where is the ladies' washroom?

01:28:42.663 --> 01:28:46.030
- Upstairs and to the left.
- To the left.

01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:50.466
In the contract, you have to dance
and do the janitorial work.

01:28:55.242 --> 01:28:56.504
- Stick out your chest.
- Yes.

01:29:00.781 --> 01:29:01.941
Mr. Hahn.

01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:04.509
Don't let those girls
get too close to me.

01:29:07.088 --> 01:29:10.148
We would like
some show business advice.

01:29:10.658 --> 01:29:13.525
My advice to you is,
get out of show business.

01:29:14.061 --> 01:29:15.028
Hit them!

01:29:18.265 --> 01:29:21.234
Get the money. Go that way.

01:29:21.635 --> 01:29:23.296
Let's hide...

01:29:35.549 --> 01:29:37.312
- We got the money.
- Let's run.

01:29:37.451 --> 01:29:39.316
This way...

01:29:39.487 --> 01:29:40.954
- We have to rescue the Prince.
- All right.

01:29:41.055 --> 01:29:42.613
Hurry up.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.528
Excuse me. How are you?

01:29:48.729 --> 01:29:51.493
Can you get my luggage for me?

01:29:54.402 --> 01:29:58.065
- That girl is so ugly.
- She is as skinny as a skeleton.

01:30:04.545 --> 01:30:07.514
- I can't hold this anymore...
- We can't get in. It is locked.

01:30:10.251 --> 01:30:12.014
1, 2, 3.

01:30:14.488 --> 01:30:16.649
What is happening? More women?

01:30:16.824 --> 01:30:18.883
You will have to wait.

01:30:19.026 --> 01:30:21.790
There is only so much water
in the fountain.

01:30:21.962 --> 01:30:24.931
- We are not girls.
- We are men.

01:30:25.699 --> 01:30:27.963
Men? I am not interested in men.

01:30:28.102 --> 01:30:29.967
If i do this, i can't face Allah.

01:30:30.271 --> 01:30:32.739
Prince, we're here to rescue you.
Let's run.

01:30:32.873 --> 01:30:34.238
- I don't want to go.
- Come on.

01:30:35.009 --> 01:30:36.874
This is interesting.
It is a swing.

01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:39.875
I want to bring this home.
It is fantastic.

01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:42.140
Don't bother. Come.
Help me up.

01:30:43.717 --> 01:30:45.184
I am sorry. Mr. Hahn.

01:30:45.352 --> 01:30:48.913
I warned you.
If those girls took the money,

01:30:49.056 --> 01:30:53.823
- you are dead.
- Please don't.

01:30:54.161 --> 01:30:55.628
I will teach you a lesson.

01:30:55.763 --> 01:30:59.324
He will stab you a few times.
And he will stab you a few times.

01:30:59.567 --> 01:31:00.932
Then he will stab you a few times.

01:31:01.068 --> 01:31:02.831
Don't you worry.

01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:04.335
They can't leave.

01:31:04.472 --> 01:31:07.839
The Pinto Ranch has so many girls.

01:31:11.045 --> 01:31:13.206
None of them can run away.

01:31:14.215 --> 01:31:16.080
Hurry up...

01:31:16.584 --> 01:31:20.042
- Where are you taking me?
- Open the door.

01:31:20.187 --> 01:31:22.553
- Don't you have the car keys?
- I don't know.

01:31:22.857 --> 01:31:25.325
- You are useless.
- Don't move.

01:31:31.332 --> 01:31:33.095
The show is over.

01:31:42.209 --> 01:31:44.370
Shield me from any bullets.

01:31:47.748 --> 01:31:53.015
It's your turn to play,
any way you like.

01:31:53.154 --> 01:31:55.520
You heard him. Any way you like.

01:31:55.689 --> 01:31:57.452
We will kill them,

01:31:57.558 --> 01:31:59.116
so that there is no evidence.

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:00.820
Kill them?

01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:06.700
J.J., there is no way out.
What do we do?

01:32:06.767 --> 01:32:07.825
Be calm.

01:32:08.469 --> 01:32:09.936
We are in trouble.

01:32:29.323 --> 01:32:30.881
Give me back my money.

01:32:30.925 --> 01:32:34.088
Money? He is got the money.

01:32:34.428 --> 01:32:35.690
Now he has the money.

01:32:37.831 --> 01:32:38.991
J.J.

01:32:44.805 --> 01:32:47.865
As is customary,
any last reguests?

01:32:49.643 --> 01:32:50.507
Right.

01:32:52.913 --> 01:32:54.175
You are so generous?

01:32:54.281 --> 01:32:56.442
My wish will make you go bankrupt.

01:32:56.517 --> 01:32:58.678
I just want to have a crazy party.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.521
I want a guiet place to figure out
the lottery numbers.

01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:06.651
I...I don't know yet...
let me think about it.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.820
I want to eat expensive seafood
and drink wine.

01:33:13.067 --> 01:33:13.931
What about you?

01:33:14.435 --> 01:33:15.595
Do you have a menu?

01:33:16.170 --> 01:33:20.129
I do. I will send you one in hell.

01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:41.261
Our rescuers are here!

01:33:50.004 --> 01:33:51.471
This ranch is not bad.

01:33:58.078 --> 01:33:59.136
Hi there!

01:34:05.753 --> 01:34:09.211
- Come on.
- I am tough.

01:34:18.132 --> 01:34:19.793
I am tough.

01:34:24.538 --> 01:34:28.406
Hey...can i have a look?

01:34:28.509 --> 01:34:31.478
- No problem.
- It is small, but it is nice.

01:34:33.981 --> 01:34:35.243
That one is escaping.

01:34:37.551 --> 01:34:38.415
I will go after him.

01:34:38.552 --> 01:34:41.020
You go and catch him.
We will take care of you.

01:34:41.155 --> 01:34:43.020
Don't worry. I will be back soon.

01:34:51.899 --> 01:34:53.867
What happened to you?
You are not good in this.

01:34:54.368 --> 01:34:56.131
- Let me do it.
- Go ahead.

01:35:01.475 --> 01:35:02.840
That guy will be miserable.

01:35:18.892 --> 01:35:20.052
You are full of energy.

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:21.921
Of course.
It is an Olympic year.

01:35:22.096 --> 01:35:23.757
- Is that right?
- I am an athlete.

01:35:25.366 --> 01:35:26.731
Don't get injured.

01:35:27.134 --> 01:35:29.602
- Sisters, it is dangerous.
- I will protect you.

01:35:30.704 --> 01:35:32.569
5, 6, 7.

01:35:34.274 --> 01:35:35.036
Next.

01:35:39.947 --> 01:35:41.608
Do you have some good ones
to show me?

01:35:41.782 --> 01:35:44.250
The craftsmanship is wonderful.
Where did you get it?

01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:45.918
It is a gift from my cousin.

01:35:47.221 --> 01:35:50.384
Good. That is enough. Forget it.

01:35:51.558 --> 01:35:53.526
- A thousand thanks.
- Bless you, my son.

01:35:57.030 --> 01:36:06.701
This way...you will know my power...

01:36:17.284 --> 01:36:19.445
- You are smart.
- Of course.

01:36:24.458 --> 01:36:28.019
We owe you $30,000.
This will pay off the debt.

01:36:29.263 --> 01:36:33.927
Good. Let's have a drink. Waiter...

01:36:34.134 --> 01:36:36.193
They are busy now.
They don't have time.

01:36:40.974 --> 01:36:42.339
I am having so much fun.

01:36:45.312 --> 01:36:47.280
- Handle them.
- No problem.

01:36:48.415 --> 01:36:51.976
Captain Chaos is here.
Don't you worry.

01:36:52.085 --> 01:36:53.848
Here comes Captain Chaos.

01:36:55.489 --> 01:36:57.354
Up in the sky.

01:36:58.959 --> 01:37:01.723
Thank goodness i am in shape.
Go ahead.

01:37:02.396 --> 01:37:05.160
Is anyone injured?
Do you need any help?

01:37:05.265 --> 01:37:06.425
Give him a shot.

01:37:06.633 --> 01:37:08.396
It is a piece of cake.

01:37:09.136 --> 01:37:14.199
Watch me.
One shot will fix everything.

01:37:21.849 --> 01:37:24.317
Jackie, i am J.J.
We are from the same group.

01:37:32.092 --> 01:37:33.559
- Let's split up.
- Yes.

01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:38.991
Hi there.

01:37:42.603 --> 01:37:44.468
- It is Superman.
- He is on a trampoline.

01:37:54.748 --> 01:37:57.114
Can you hold this for me?

01:37:57.184 --> 01:38:01.052
Let me look at this.
The more i look, the more i like it.

01:38:05.492 --> 01:38:06.754
I am finished.

01:38:07.494 --> 01:38:08.961
Take that...

01:38:09.162 --> 01:38:13.929
Don't move...stop it.

01:38:15.068 --> 01:38:16.035
Look.

01:38:17.437 --> 01:38:18.802
It is a miracle.

01:38:18.972 --> 01:38:22.430
- No.
- No. it is us.

01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:26.676
- J.J.
- Captain Chaos.

01:38:27.748 --> 01:38:29.010
You are my girl.

01:38:29.917 --> 01:38:33.080
- This time i needed your help.
- No problem.

01:38:34.021 --> 01:38:36.683
We are here for you.

01:38:37.324 --> 01:38:38.689
- Did you miss us?
- A bit.

01:38:38.859 --> 01:38:40.019
This much.

01:38:41.028 --> 01:38:42.689
A bit more.

01:38:42.829 --> 01:38:44.694
- A bit more?
- All right.

01:38:46.066 --> 01:38:48.125
My dear. How lovely!

01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:51.135
Fenderbaum.

01:38:53.907 --> 01:38:56.068
- Couple to couple.
- Wait a minute.

01:38:59.513 --> 01:39:03.074
Fenderbaum,
don't mess with my partner.

01:39:03.584 --> 01:39:05.449
- Your partner?
- Partner?...

01:39:05.586 --> 01:39:09.147
Right. I bought the ranch.

01:39:09.556 --> 01:39:10.523
Right.

01:39:12.693 --> 01:39:15.856
It was worth it. I like this.

01:39:16.697 --> 01:39:19.257
I can't live without women.

01:39:21.168 --> 01:39:24.035
You got away with it this time.
You idiot.

01:39:24.237 --> 01:39:26.797
Does this guy know
you owe a lot of money?

01:39:27.507 --> 01:39:29.771
It doesn't help if you yell at me.
Stingy.

01:39:31.545 --> 01:39:33.103
- Prince.
- My partner.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:36.947
Prince, i need money to buy women.

01:39:37.851 --> 01:39:38.818
How much?

01:39:40.887 --> 01:39:42.354
$9,000,000.

01:39:42.556 --> 01:39:45.923
$9,000,000?
It's such a small amount.

01:39:46.526 --> 01:39:47.788
I will give you $18,000,000.

01:39:47.928 --> 01:39:49.896
Get some high guality girls.

01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:52.291
Thank you.
Why are you leaving so soon?

01:39:52.866 --> 01:39:54.527
I have a race to finish.

01:39:55.302 --> 01:39:57.463
Since everyone is here,

01:39:57.671 --> 01:39:59.832
in order to celebrate,

01:40:00.007 --> 01:40:01.372
I'd like to announce that the prize

01:40:01.508 --> 01:40:04.773
has been increased to $2,000,000.

01:40:04.845 --> 01:40:06.710
Great...

01:40:06.813 --> 01:40:09.179
- How many houses can that buy?
- I don't know.

01:40:09.282 --> 01:40:10.544
$2,000,000.

01:40:10.651 --> 01:40:12.915
If we win, we'll split it 3 ways.
Good...

01:40:13.086 --> 01:40:15.350
Get into the car, dear.
Get into the car.

01:40:16.323 --> 01:40:18.188
Get into the car...

01:40:24.531 --> 01:40:26.192
Fenderbaum, Blake, come here.

01:40:27.467 --> 01:40:29.332
Sir, we are going to race.

01:40:29.536 --> 01:40:32.903
I know. I'll be faster than you.
See you at the finish line.

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:32.495
Jackie, you are an average player.

01:41:32.632 --> 01:41:34.691
Don't embarrass yourself next time.

01:42:04.197 --> 01:42:08.065
Your pulse is irregular.
How am i going to cure you?

01:42:08.168 --> 01:42:09.931
Shut up...you are bothering me.

01:42:10.103 --> 01:42:13.561
Just keep me in shape until the end.

01:42:22.649 --> 01:42:24.412
The Prince is going to fail again.

01:42:25.786 --> 01:42:29.847
We are going to win.
We will get a million dollars.

01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:31.953
Each one gets a million.

01:42:38.765 --> 01:42:40.130
It is Frank.

01:42:41.434 --> 01:42:42.799
He is driving really fast.

01:42:43.003 --> 01:42:46.564
We have to be faster than him.
Go ahead.

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:48.305
We are at the limit.

01:42:48.875 --> 01:42:51.343
We want to talk business with you.
It is me.

01:42:51.545 --> 01:42:53.410
We are old pals.

01:42:53.547 --> 01:42:57.608
No matter who wins,
we will split it in half.

01:42:59.085 --> 01:43:00.848
You get 70 percent.
We get 30 percent.

01:43:02.122 --> 01:43:03.987
What about 10 percent?

01:43:05.759 --> 01:43:06.919
I won't care.

01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:33.117
No need to rush.
The champion arrived 4 hours ago.

01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:34.687
Get a drink and take a rest.

01:43:34.821 --> 01:43:37.187
The race continues tomorrow.
That is it.

01:43:38.792 --> 01:43:40.157
Who won? I have to take a look.

01:43:41.528 --> 01:43:44.497
We can't lose the race tomorrow.

01:43:44.931 --> 01:43:48.594
Relax. We didn't forget about you.

01:43:48.902 --> 01:43:51.769
You lost the Cannonball Run again.

01:43:51.938 --> 01:43:54.099
You really make me mad.

01:43:54.274 --> 01:43:57.038
Father, the doctor gave me
the wrong shot.

01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:58.472
That is why i lost.

01:43:58.578 --> 01:44:01.240
I am warning you.
If you don't win tomorrow,

01:44:01.381 --> 01:44:05.044
you will never drive again.
You will be riding camels.

01:44:05.218 --> 01:44:07.686
Father, don't get mad.
I will win tomorrow.

01:44:08.154 --> 01:44:10.918
Because i invited today's champion
to be my partner.

01:44:11.024 --> 01:44:13.185
This will work perfectly.

01:44:13.426 --> 01:44:17.385
He is just like you.
He admires you, too.

01:44:17.731 --> 01:44:18.891
Let's meet him.

01:44:21.468 --> 01:44:25.131
Let me introduce you.
Father, here is today's champion.
