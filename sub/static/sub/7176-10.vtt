WEBVTT

01:28.589 --> 01:30.798
All the treasure
is here, as promised.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.770
They have met
their obligations.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.607
The emperor expects
that you will meet yours,

01:47.691 --> 01:48.983
and leave immediately.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.792
I'll tell Ragnar.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.661
They've brought
the payment.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.834
I said...
I heard you.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.967
It makes no
difference to me.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.762
I am dying.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.647
But at least I know,

03:11.275 --> 03:12.817
I will see
Athelstan again.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.748
What did
I tell you, Rollo?

03:27.833 --> 03:30.251
I warned
all of you.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.753
The priest poisoned
Ragnar's mind

03:32.838 --> 03:34.797
and now we see
the fruit of it.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.215
It's true.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.051
And now I have
a heavy heart.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.727
I cannot believe
that Ragnar is
truly a Christian.

03:47.811 --> 03:48.894
Not in his heart.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.188
You saw what you saw.
And I heard what I heard.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.357
But you too, were
baptized, Rollo.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.567
It did not change you.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.819
I did not want
it to change me.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.822
The gods protected me
from the Christian magic.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.866
But they refused
to protect Ragnar.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.035
Why?
You know why.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.829
His name
was Athelstan.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.622
Do you think
it's true?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.207
What they're
saying about
Ragnar?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.792
I hope so.
Why?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.128
Because no
Christian king

04:14.212 --> 04:16.589
will ever be allowed
to rule our world.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.257
It's unthinkable.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.384
An insult to our
gods and our people.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.596
Then someone
needs to kill him.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.581
Princess Gisla,
I want to talk
with you.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.707
Not now, Count.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.876
It's neither the time
nor place for
earthly things.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.420
Forgive me.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.424
Count Odo,

05:41.508 --> 05:44.635
the princess doesn't
seem to appreciate
your valor.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.512
You saved our city.

05:47.305 --> 05:51.434
Please, allow me
to demonstrate
my gratitude.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.358
Later, perhaps.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.409
What a day
to celebrate.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.786
Our precious city
is saved.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.039
We paid them
to go away.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.500
How do you count
that a victory, Father?

06:17.627 --> 06:21.255
Because next time,
we will be better prepared.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.134
We will block the rivers,
prevent their incursions.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.888
If only my
grandfather was here.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.765
If only Charlemagne
was here.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.101
How we would rejoice.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.519
Are you sure?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.607
Now I am tired.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.610
God bless you,
Daughter.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.904
God bless Paris.

07:27.531 --> 07:28.989
Helga.
Let go of me!

07:29.074 --> 07:30.783
No, no, no, no.
Please!
Yes!

07:31.785 --> 07:34.954
After such knowledge,
what forgiveness?

07:35.038 --> 07:36.789
But you don't
understand.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.123
What is there
to understand?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.708
Everything!

07:56.351 --> 07:57.810
There will
come a time

07:59.729 --> 08:02.815
when you will
be responsible
for our people.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.777
You are our king.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.445
Hmm.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.863
For now.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.411
But when your time comes,

08:17.163 --> 08:18.872
you must lead with your head,

08:19.624 --> 08:21.250
not with your heart.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.711
Can you do that?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.629
Yes, Father.

08:27.090 --> 08:31.051
I have something,
I only trust you
to do for me.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.948
If you would
truly see what the gods
have in store for you,

08:53.074 --> 08:57.077
you would go down
now and dance naked
on the beach.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.921
Where does your husband
think you are tonight?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.215
My husband
will be too drunk
to even care.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.383
I almost
believe you.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.431
The princess will not
speak with you tonight.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.144
She will speak
with me, eventually.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.813
Her father
will insist.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.983
She seems very boring.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.778
So moral.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.571
So good.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.241
It is very tedious.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.246
You would soon tire
of her, believe me.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.915
Perhaps.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.544
But then again, breaking
her could be interesting.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.842
Is there a way
that I could
keep your interest?

10:02.519 --> 10:03.852
Come.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.521
We will see.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.860
If you would submit.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.778
To what?

10:55.530 --> 10:57.239
To being chained
up and whipped.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.454
Of course, I will allow
you to choose the whip.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.998
Some are more severe
than others.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.767
You will always be
able to call a halt,

11:25.769 --> 11:28.228
though I would prefer
to decide myself.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.308
It would keep
my interest.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.144
Undoubtedly.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.348
Tell me
when to strike.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.727
Say strike.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.278
Strike.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.667
What are you doing?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.174
Ragnar asked
me to build him
one last boat.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.330
It's almost a month
since we gave them
their blood money.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.082
So why are they
still here?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.375
We don't know.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.627
Perhaps it is
time we found out.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.272
He wants to know
why you're still here
and not returned home.

14:59.983 --> 15:00.983
They have honored
their pledge,

15:01.067 --> 15:03.235
why are you not
honoring yours?

15:06.948 --> 15:10.158
Our king, my father,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

15:11.160 --> 15:13.203
is too weak
and ill to travel.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.343
He wants to see.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.809
Wait.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.416
If he dies,
he has only
asked one thing.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.588
That he receive
a proper Christian burial.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.090
Otherwise,
we will not leave.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.031
He says you may
bring his body
to the cathedral,

16:31.115 --> 16:32.991
carried by unarmed men.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.119
They will say
a Christian mass
for his soul.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.070
You can go
talk to him now.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.037
Who knows, Ragnar,
what the gods have
in store for us.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.415
But this,

20:08.499 --> 20:10.333
I can never imagine.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.756
If you have
gone to heaven,

20:16.841 --> 20:19.300
then we will
never meet again.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.221
And yet,

20:23.305 --> 20:26.099
I think Odin will
ride like the wind,

20:26.183 --> 20:28.018
and rescue you,

20:28.102 --> 20:30.562
and take you to Valhalla,
where you belong,

20:30.646 --> 20:32.647
my own sweet Ragnar.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.608
And there,

20:35.693 --> 20:37.819
there we shall meet again,

20:37.903 --> 20:40.822
and fight and drink

20:42.241 --> 20:44.242
and love one another.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.664
I have never stopped
loving you.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.251
Not for one moment.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.174
You and I were
born to be together.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.804
I've always resented
you, it's true.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.682
No point denying it.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.979
I'm sorry you're dead,

21:13.814 --> 21:16.274
but it happens to all
of us, sooner or later.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.946
It's just funny that
the gods took you first.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.035
I always thought
they favored you.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.748
You thought so, too.

21:35.878 --> 21:39.547
You thought
you were a god, Ragnar.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.969
But in the end,

21:46.472 --> 21:48.139
you're just a man.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.352
So, then...

21:56.607 --> 21:59.234
I made the boat that
took you to fame,

22:03.781 --> 22:07.492
and I made the boat
that will take
you to your heaven.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.163
Give my regards
to Athelstan,
by the way.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.419
You betrayed us.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.922
You betrayed your heritage.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.841
You betrayed our future.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.926
You betrayed me!

22:25.803 --> 22:28.221
I loved you
more than anyone.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.182
I loved you more
than that priest
ever loved you.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.685
But it made no difference.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.813
You always thought,
"Oh, it's just Floki.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.898
"No need to
bother about Floki.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.692
"He's just a fool."

22:45.281 --> 22:48.408
I hate you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.790
And I love you
with all my heart.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.963
Why do you tear me
away from myself?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.232
Princess!

28:23.785 --> 28:25.328
I win.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.243
The princess!

29:46.034 --> 29:47.034
Cut them!

29:52.374 --> 29:53.666
Go!

31:36.061 --> 31:38.979
I can see
that not the living,

31:39.231 --> 31:41.982
but the dead,
will conquer Paris.

32:58.727 --> 33:02.521
Your Highness,
they raided many
parts of the city,

33:02.606 --> 33:05.191
took what they
wanted and left.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.653
Imperial Highness.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.494
Your Highness.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.997
They have
violated our city.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.251
What is there
to say?

33:25.921 --> 33:28.672
All the angels in
heaven are weeping.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.551
Father, get up.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.429
The heathens
have gone.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.285
Your Highness.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.543
Why did you not
tell us earlier?

34:05.627 --> 34:07.294
Did you not trust us?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.589
I did what my father
asked me to do.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.882
But...

34:11.967 --> 34:14.134
It was the way
he wanted to do it
and he is still king!

34:16.054 --> 34:17.972
And he succeeded.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.557
Hmm. He got us
into Paris.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.892
And now we have
even more spoils.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.320
We leave the camp
tomorrow for home.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.489
But because we intend
on raiding Paris
again in the spring,

34:35.574 --> 34:38.993
it is important
to maintain some
sort of presence here.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.330
I will stay.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.500
No.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.921
You have no reason
to stay here, Floki.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.218
And what reason
do you have, Uncle?

35:05.061 --> 35:06.687
Then it is decided.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.523
You will winter
here with the rest
of the warriors

35:09.608 --> 35:10.899
who decide
to stay with you.

36:21.304 --> 36:25.432
It is wonderful to be able
to eat good food again.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.937
These snails are
so plump, so juicy.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.150
You know
that the Northmen
have not all left.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.989
The great warrior
called Rollo has
remained in the camp.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.741
But most have gone.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.368
Yes...

36:44.452 --> 36:45.869
But they will
return again.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.788
That is why
Rollo has remained.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.374
They will return
in the spring,

36:50.458 --> 36:52.960
probably in even
greater numbers.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.671
Surely one of your brothers
will come to our aid?

36:57.966 --> 37:01.552
I have been weak enough
to send messages to them.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.139
I have begged
and pleaded our
cause to no avail.

37:06.141 --> 37:08.642
Their hatred for me
turns out to be
the supreme

37:08.727 --> 37:10.728
and guiding principle
of their lives.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.113
So, what are we to do?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.582
I will not be
known to history

37:32.125 --> 37:36.712
as the French emperor
who presided over
the destruction of Paris.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.798
I cannot
and will not allow

37:39.883 --> 37:43.510
such an intolerable fate
to befall our beloved city.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.721
You will have
to offer them
even more money.

37:50.477 --> 37:53.645
I will have to offer them
even more than that.

37:55.315 --> 37:58.817
I must offer them something
far more precious to me

37:59.611 --> 38:02.029
than gold or silver.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.205
I must offer your
hand in marriage.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.793
This is
Count Odo's doing.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.753
Just because I
refuse to marry him,

38:17.837 --> 38:20.214
he wants to have me
thrown to the dogs.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.799
Will you not
consider it, my child,

38:21.883 --> 38:23.217
for the sake of Paris?

38:23.593 --> 38:27.012
I would do almost anything
for the sake of Paris.

38:27.096 --> 38:30.307
I would kill myself
for the sake of Paris.

38:30.558 --> 38:33.143
But I will not be tied
in holy matrimony

38:33.228 --> 38:35.229
to someone who is
more beast than man.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.066
Then I will have
to recall our deputation.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.530
You have already
sent an envoy
to make this offer?

38:45.573 --> 38:47.157
Without even
asking me?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.535
Without even
thinking of me?

38:50.286 --> 38:51.537
Oh, Father!

38:51.996 --> 38:53.705
I am your father.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.918
But I am also
the Emperor of Frankia.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.922
And it is not your father
who asks this of you,

39:02.590 --> 39:04.258
it is the emperor.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.134
And therefore,

39:07.387 --> 39:08.637
you will obey him.

39:26.114 --> 39:30.033
You will be offered a vast
area of land in the northern
part of Frankia.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.202
The emperor will
also make you a duke,

39:32.287 --> 39:34.580
the highest honor
he can bestow.

39:34.664 --> 39:37.666
You will be very rich,
and you will be
very important.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.344
The emperor also
offers the hand
in marriage

39:49.429 --> 39:51.888
of his beautiful
daughter, Princess Gisla.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.646
What must
I do in return?

40:10.283 --> 40:12.826
You will defend Paris
against your brother.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.977
Floki!

43:15.009 --> 43:17.135
You killed Athelstan.
