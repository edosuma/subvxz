00:01.302 --> 00:04.138
Previously on Salvation...
RE/SYST.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.074
The hacker group sent you
the photo unsolicited?

00:06.107 --> 00:07.007
Yeah.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.244
I should get something
for my troubles, no?

00:12.113 --> 00:13.747
NAOMI: I've done a deep dive
on Zoe Barrows.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.083
DYLAN:
She friended me.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.584
Our parents are dating.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.585
You're back.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.319
Two conditions.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.521
First, I'm gonna
lead the room.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.522
Done.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.690
And the other thing?

00:22.723 --> 00:25.093
JILLIAN: I want to know
what I'm really working on.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.427
DYLAN: There's a manhunt
for Darius Tanz

00:26.460 --> 00:28.496
and Grace Barrows in Moscow.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.198
They're wanted
for murder.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.566
TANZ: Professor Croft.
Welcome to Moscow.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.601
You're not dead.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.603
Son of a bitch!

00:35.636 --> 00:37.605
Atlas is a weapons program.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.507
TANZ:
Yes, except the weapon

00:39.540 --> 00:41.075
was an asteroid.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.810
And we crashed it into Russia?

00:42.843 --> 00:44.345
Can the United
States of America

00:44.378 --> 00:45.479
and Russia

00:45.513 --> 00:49.350
ever learn to trust each other
after all that happened?

00:49.383 --> 00:51.352
Well, the Russians say
there's no deal

00:51.385 --> 00:54.188
unless Grace and Darius
run point on this operation.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.790
Seems they're the only ones
the Russians trust.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.692
HARRIS:
And the only ones we don't.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.561
Grace Barrows,
you're under arrest.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.429
What?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.364
HARRIS:
For violation of the Logan Act.

01:07.335 --> 01:10.138
But only if
you want it to.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.072
(door closes)

01:22.583 --> 01:24.385
(thump in distance)

01:30.224 --> 01:32.260
Zoe?

01:36.264 --> 01:38.266
*

01:53.181 --> 01:54.615
(sighs)

01:56.784 --> 01:59.553
(cell phone ringing, vibrating)

01:59.587 --> 02:01.922
Hey, Zoe. Thank God it's you.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.392
Yes, I'm fine. I'm okay.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.926
I'm so sorry about
what happened here.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.896
It's just
a-a huge misunderstanding.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.298
(sighs)

02:10.331 --> 02:12.333
Honey, it's a long story.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.436
The important thing is
that I'm home and I'm safe.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.805
No, no, no,
you stay put at Dad's.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.308
We'll talk in the morning, okay?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.343
I love you.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.215
(grunting)

02:31.285 --> 02:32.453
(Grace screams)

02:36.890 --> 02:38.692
(gasping)

02:42.463 --> 02:44.232
(silenced gunshot)

02:45.999 --> 02:47.535
(body thuds)

02:47.568 --> 02:49.537
GRACE:
Hi, Daddy, it's me.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.506
I think I need your help.

03:00.314 --> 03:04.285
The EmDrive-- they said
it couldn't be done.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.887
But we did it.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.822
It's beautiful.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.293
TANZ:
Let's admire it while we can,

03:12.326 --> 03:14.895
because tomorrow
it moves to the launch bay.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.366
And to think, all it took was
a billion dollars,

03:18.399 --> 03:21.302
a supercomputer,
an extremely rare space rock...

03:21.335 --> 03:24.338
And a turncoat
professor.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.710
Yeah.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.280
I still can't believe
Croft's alive.

03:34.282 --> 03:37.651
He sent his most sincere
apologies, by the way.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.954
I don't know if I feel
better or worse

03:40.988 --> 03:42.456
that I'm not a killer.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.957
If it's any
consolation,

03:43.991 --> 03:48.362
the Russians didn't seem
particularly enamored with him.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.334
And do you think
we can trust them

03:53.367 --> 03:54.568
not to double-cross us?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.270
This is the only one
of its kind.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.204
If anything happens to it,

03:57.237 --> 03:59.640
we do not have time
to build a new one.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.375
Which is why the EmDrive
stays with me

04:01.409 --> 04:03.477
and the launch codes
stay with Tess

04:03.511 --> 04:06.414
until I'm satisfied
that the Russians

04:06.447 --> 04:08.248
and the Pentagon play nice.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.019
(sighs)

04:12.052 --> 04:13.921
Big day tomorrow.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.025
Good work, Liam.

04:23.597 --> 04:28.068
HUGH: Good thing your mother
and I didn't take that cruise.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.372
Just the one slug, right?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.040
Anyone else know about this?

04:33.073 --> 04:36.076
I don't know who I can trust.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.011
(blows)

04:38.045 --> 04:39.680
What are you doing?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.750
He was carrying
a Beretta PX4.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.453
No serial number,
custom compensator,

04:45.486 --> 04:47.355
six-inch silencer.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.689
Meaning?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.358
The guy was a pro.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.726
If we can I.D. him,

04:52.760 --> 04:55.896
we might be able to figure out
who hired him.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.465
What exactly did you do

04:57.498 --> 04:59.467
for the CIA?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.738
I'm not sure why I thought
you'd answer that.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.417
It's encrypted.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.118
I know a guy
pretty good with technology.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.687
He should be able to crack it.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.954
I know a guy, too.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.424
Trust me, mine's better.

05:25.459 --> 05:29.430
Look, I'm sorry I...
brought you into this.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.964
You did the
right thing.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.566
I'll cash in
some favors.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.437
In a few hours, there'll be
no blood, no DNA, no body.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.738
You'll never know
anything happened here.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.740
But I will know.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.410
I'll know a man tried
to kill me in my living room.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.111
I mean, how do I
keep that from Zoe?

05:44.144 --> 05:46.346
H-How do I even go back to work?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.083
Here's what
you're gonna do.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.386
You're gonna go upstairs
and get dressed,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.388
as if it were
any other day.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.523
You're gonna put
on your makeup.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.590
(elevator bell chimes)

05:56.624 --> 05:58.592
HUGH: You're gonna walk
into the Pentagon

05:58.626 --> 06:01.762
like you've done
a thousand times before.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.764
Because there's nothing else
you can do.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.436
When you come across the person

06:08.469 --> 06:11.572
who never expected
to see you again,

06:11.605 --> 06:13.774
you'll know it.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.978
*

06:49.076 --> 06:50.744
Well, shall we get started?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.555
(elevator bell dings)

07:12.600 --> 07:14.835
*

07:21.509 --> 07:22.810
(computer chimes)

07:37.591 --> 07:39.660
First, Defense Minister Toporov,

07:39.693 --> 07:41.161
I'd like to thank you
for agreeing

07:41.194 --> 07:43.230
to this joint effort between
Russia and the United States.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.834
Don't thank me,
thank Mr. Tanz and Ms. Barrows.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.268
Their courageous actions

07:48.301 --> 07:49.803
made this possible.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.639
Don't fret, Mr. Minister,
Grace has already been given

07:51.672 --> 07:54.274
the standard American pat
on the back for a job well done.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.743
Right, Mr. Deputy Secretary?

07:55.776 --> 07:59.647
Mr. Tanz, if you please,
take us through the plan.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.015
TANZ:
Certainly.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.586
First...

08:05.619 --> 08:08.589
we install the EmDrive
on the gravity tractor.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.559
We then load that onto
the Goliath Two rocket.

08:11.592 --> 08:15.596
Once in orbit, the EmDrive
will initiate thrust,

08:15.629 --> 08:18.732
and propel the GT
to the asteroid.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.601
And once it reaches it?

08:20.634 --> 08:21.735
Flies alongside it,

08:21.769 --> 08:24.538
creates a gravitational force
that pulls the asteroid

08:24.572 --> 08:26.006
off its trajectory.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.942
Just enough to miss
our fair planet.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.211
But to accomplish this,

08:31.244 --> 08:33.547
we have to launch
within 72 hours.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.716
(voice fading):
The GT takes four weeks to get

08:35.749 --> 08:37.284
to the asteroid,
and as many months

08:37.317 --> 08:39.553
to do its job,
and we're out of time.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.789
(Harris continues talking
indistinctly)

08:41.822 --> 08:43.591
*

08:50.363 --> 08:52.800
HARRIS:
Grace? Grace?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.802
Excuse me?

08:54.835 --> 08:57.070
The deal?
About the launch codes?

08:58.972 --> 09:03.043
Yes, uh, our government
has agreed to grant Darius

09:03.076 --> 09:05.045
and his team full control
of the gravity tractor launch,

09:05.078 --> 09:10.217
with joint supervision by both
Russian and U.S. officials.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.653
To ensure there's
no foul play, on either side.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.122
TOPOROV:
Our scientists maintain

09:15.155 --> 09:16.590
there are still risks.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.892
There's risk when
you walk across the street.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.194
This option is, to be frank,

09:21.228 --> 09:24.865
our last best hope
to preserve life on this planet.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.606
Your terms are acceptable.

09:33.707 --> 09:37.110
My scientists
will stand at the ready.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.213
Upon success,

09:40.247 --> 09:43.216
may we usher in
a new era of peace.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.918
TOPOROV: Thank you,
Mr. Secretary.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.020
CALHOUN: In light of
all that's transpired

09:47.054 --> 09:49.089
between our nations,
we thank you

09:49.122 --> 09:51.925
and your country for
this leap of faith.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.632
I'm not always the keenest
observer of moods,

09:58.666 --> 10:02.002
but if I'm not mistaken, you
don't seem very happy about...

10:02.035 --> 10:03.003
(lock clicks)

10:03.036 --> 10:05.405
...saving the world.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.074
Someone tried to kill me.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.409
What?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.411
Last night, after you left,
someone was in my house.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.180
Are you all right?
Me? Yeah.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.415
Him not so much.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.250
You didn't call
the police.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.788
My father handled it.
Don't ask.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.957
Why would someone
want me dead?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.392
Atlas?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.060
Or to blow the deal.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.361
If you wouldn't
have shown,

10:28.395 --> 10:29.863
the Russians would've
gotten spooked,

10:29.897 --> 10:31.899
called off the launch.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.403
This is all we found
on the body.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.672
It's encrypted. If you can
crack it, maybe we can...

10:38.706 --> 10:39.940
(phone vibrating)

10:46.914 --> 10:48.415
(phone beeps)

10:53.186 --> 10:54.922
(line clicks, beeps)

10:54.955 --> 10:57.090
(whispering):
Someone's checking in.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.259
To see if the job was done.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.697
Grace, we're gonna find
out who targeted you,

11:03.731 --> 11:07.735
and when we do,
there'll be hell to pay.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.740
*

11:28.188 --> 11:30.891
Here you go.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.426
New I.D. badge, new title.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.396
Skybox supervisor.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.365
Hey.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.367
If the gravity tractor
is gonna launch,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.236
why is Darius moving forward
with the Ark Project?

11:43.270 --> 11:46.039
That's a worst-case
scenario, you know.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.376
Not sure I can do this.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.411
What?
Just...

11:51.444 --> 11:53.313
look them in the eye,
lie to their faces?

11:55.348 --> 11:58.451
Well, does it... does it
help that Mason's a prick?

11:58.485 --> 12:01.288
No.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.758
Remember you have an
important mission...

12:04.792 --> 12:06.493
and it's for the
greater good.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.796
That's the way
I got through it.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.900
Liam, I, uh...

12:12.933 --> 12:15.002
I just can't...

12:15.035 --> 12:18.972
jump back into... us.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.210
I'm still trying to process
everything that's happened.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.411
No, I know. I know.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.519
Can we just... take it slow?

12:32.552 --> 12:33.520
Sure.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.789
What, like, snail slow?

12:35.823 --> 12:37.457
Like turtle slow.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.462
Sure. I mean, turtles are much
faster than snails, right?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.533
Come on, get in there.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.274
TANZ: ...team of scientists
worked around the clock

12:54.307 --> 12:55.408
to develop this
technology.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.944
It's truly a
thing of wonder,

12:56.977 --> 13:00.113
and we're very proud
to-to have it and to show it...

13:06.219 --> 13:07.821
(talking quietly)

13:07.855 --> 13:08.856
Ah, Liam.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.459
Guys, can you give us a second?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.961
Liam, this is Dr. Vassily Orlov,

13:13.994 --> 13:16.529
Chief Science Advisor
to the Kremlin.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.365
Quite the pleasure to meet you.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.067
What you have accomplished here

13:20.100 --> 13:21.969
is nothing less
than extraordinary.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.837
Well, uh, thank you,
Dr. Orlov.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.473
A lot of blood, sweat and tears
went into this.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.975
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:28.008 --> 13:30.844
we'll need six hours to
disassemble the EmDrive,

13:30.878 --> 13:32.479
two hours to transport
to Wallops,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.047
and then ten hours to reassemble

13:34.081 --> 13:35.615
and load onto
the gravity tractor.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.384
Mr. Cole here
has been instructed

13:37.417 --> 13:39.887
to oversee the care and feeding
of the EmDrive.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.855
Direct all questions to him.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.925
It's been a pleasure.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.260
Thank you all.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.097
Um, this is a room full
of military bigwigs,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.899
and you want me
to be in charge?

13:51.932 --> 13:55.402
In any baseball game,
the umpire has the power.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.071
If there's trouble, buzz me.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.344
(chuckles softly)

14:10.617 --> 14:13.286
ED: So, when I explicitly told
you to drop the Atlas story,

14:13.320 --> 14:16.156
you decided, "Hey, why not do
the exact damn opposite"?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.657
It needed to be told.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.127
There are a
dozen places

14:20.160 --> 14:23.630
I can call right now
that would jump at the chance

14:23.663 --> 14:25.565
to expose a government
conspiracy this big.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.566
Your sources are
all off the record.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.436
Yeah, like a little thing
called Watergate.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.471
Amanda...
Everything
in that envelope

14:31.504 --> 14:33.573
not only matches up
with what I already know,

14:33.606 --> 14:35.342
it filled in all the gaps.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.443
And you don't
find that convenient?

14:36.476 --> 14:39.312
The missing details regarding
the story of the century

14:39.346 --> 14:41.614
fall out of the sky
and land on your desk?

14:41.648 --> 14:42.882
You're right.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.618
It is the story of the century.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.520
And it's my name
on the byline,

14:47.554 --> 14:49.189
so if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.124
Fire me. Sue me. Okay?

14:51.158 --> 14:54.194
But if I'm right, Ed...

14:54.227 --> 14:59.899
Capitol Eyes will be the
hottest news site in the world.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.273
DYLAN:
A misunderstanding?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.441
What kind of misunderstanding
gets your mother

15:08.475 --> 15:10.944
arrested by her alleged
boyfriend and Pentagon police

15:10.978 --> 15:12.712
and then released the same day?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.147
I know.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.616
It's... incredible.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.551
The lies just keep
coming with her,

15:18.585 --> 15:20.720
and I don't know
what to think.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.992
What if... what if
I did know what to think?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.994
What does that mean?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.462
Well, you know
you're going to Africa

15:29.496 --> 15:31.098
because you want
to make a difference.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.665
Yeah.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.601
What if you could do
some of the most important work

15:34.634 --> 15:37.070
of your life right here?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.638
With me.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.142
Doing what?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.511
GRACE:
What are we looking at?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.079
TANZ: Tess unlocked your
would-be assassin's phone,

15:46.113 --> 15:48.081
but it had another
layer of encryption

15:48.115 --> 15:50.750
to conceal all incoming
and outgoing messages.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.619
TESS:
Decrypting now.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.322
GRACE:
It's my address.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.293
(sighs)

16:02.329 --> 16:03.630
Sorry.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.433
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.970
You're lucky to be alive.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.677
(computer beeps)

16:17.710 --> 16:19.612
GRACE:
"Consider it done.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.250
Then Tanz.
Money is in your account."

16:23.283 --> 16:25.252
I was next.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.587
We need to find out
who he was working for.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.559
Tess, can you extract
the sender's phone number?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.727
TESS:
It's a 710 area code.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.764
Wait, 710-- that's reserved
for government officials

16:37.797 --> 16:40.067
during emergencies
when normal networks are down.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.401
Someone's using it for cover.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.802
Because it's untraceable.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.771
We may be able to find
where the texts came from.

16:44.804 --> 16:48.041
Tess, try and geotag
those incoming messages.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.776
Meantime, I'm getting you
a bodyguard.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.478
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.214
Grace, I'm not gonna allow
anything to happen to you.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.783
Darius, what happened
in Moscow...

16:56.816 --> 16:58.751
Needs to stay
in Moscow. I know.

16:58.785 --> 16:59.719
Things are just too...

16:59.752 --> 17:01.488
Complicated.
No.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.390
Insane.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.691
Damn, just when
I thought we were

17:04.724 --> 17:06.159
finishing
each other's sentences.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.063
The bodyguard-- you-you
won't know he's even there

17:10.097 --> 17:11.498
unless you need him.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.533
(phone chimes, vibrates)

17:20.673 --> 17:23.143
Dr. Orlov, you're leaving?

17:23.176 --> 17:25.178
Why?

17:25.212 --> 17:27.780
We've received instructions.

17:27.814 --> 17:32.085
The deal on the table
has been revoked.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.321
I'm so sorry, Mr. Tanz.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.223
I'm so sorry.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.757
GRACE:
Liam, what's going on?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.527
This.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.728
HARRIS:
I understand, sir.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.497
I urge you to reconsider.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.267
Yes, of course.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.703
The Russians just
pulled their people.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.105
The joint launch is off.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.840
What the hell is happening?

17:57.744 --> 17:58.745
Capitol Eyes?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.513
No one reads this trash.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.115
CALHOUN:
No one has to.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.650
It's being picked up
by every major

18:03.683 --> 18:05.618
news organization in the country
and it's spreading.

18:05.652 --> 18:09.622
But the-the Russians
already know about Atlas.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.191
What's changed?

18:11.224 --> 18:15.162
The article says Chelyabinsk
wasn't an accident.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.298
That we landed a meteor there
on purpose.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.803
HARRIS:
So, in other words,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.872
the truth.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.744
(whooping, excited chatter)

18:31.778 --> 18:34.381
(upbeat music playing)

18:34.414 --> 18:36.549
I told you I'd put us
on the map.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.585
You did. I'm sorry
I ever doubted you.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.821
Hey, everyone,
listen up, listen up.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.224
Look, before today,
this little site of ours

18:44.257 --> 18:46.526
never got 10,000 hits
on a single article.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.895
Today, we're about
to hit a million.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.199
So, please, raise a glass
to our intrepid reporter

18:52.232 --> 18:53.666
Amanda Neel.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.369
Hopefully she remembers us
after she wins a Pulitzer.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.570
(laughs)
Cheers.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.639
(applause, whooping)

18:59.672 --> 19:01.574
Mm.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.943
Ed, the White House
just issued a statement.
Turn it up.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.246
Mackenzie, who denounced
the website as rag journalism,

19:06.279 --> 19:07.647
issued the following statement:

19:07.680 --> 19:09.816
"We categorically
deny the allegations

19:09.849 --> 19:11.518
"published by Capitol Eyes.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.486
"The article was unsourced,
(phones ringing)

19:13.520 --> 19:16.356
"false, and further proof
that the deep state

19:16.389 --> 19:18.725
is attempting to undermine
this presidency."

19:18.758 --> 19:20.627
MAN: Someone answer
the damn phones!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.729
Just say, "No comment."

19:22.762 --> 19:26.199
President just called us liars
on national television.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.668
Well, what did you think
she was gonna say?

19:28.701 --> 19:32.339
"Oops, I intentionally bombed
Russia with space rocks.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.540
Sorry."

19:33.573 --> 19:35.675
MAN: No comment.
WOMAN: No comment.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.545
This is why Russia has been
at odds with us.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.714
Why someone tried to kill me
when I poked my nose into it.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.916
MAN: We have no
comment at this time.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.852
(phones continue ringing)

19:45.885 --> 19:47.554
WOMAN:
No comment.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.821
If we can't shore up
on this story fast,

19:48.855 --> 19:49.922
our heads are
gonna roll.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.358
You need to haul ass

19:51.391 --> 19:54.694
and get sources
on the record, now!

19:57.797 --> 19:59.299
Minister Toporov,

19:59.332 --> 20:01.801
is there anything
I can do to persuade you?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.738
Of course.
I-I understand.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.340
(phone chimes)

20:07.374 --> 20:08.675
It's over.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.645
Amanda Neel just texted me
a link to the article.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.947
Darius, she's asking
me if I'm her source.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.949
Asking you?
She doesn't know?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.618
She must think I leaked
the information to her.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.487
First, someone
tries to kill me.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.821
Now Atlas leaks
to the press.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.657
This-this timing can't
be a coincidence.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.993
(phone chimes)

20:27.026 --> 20:28.995
It's my father.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.930
He's got intel.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.704
Russian subs are moving back
into firing range.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.706
By tomorrow, we'll be
where we were a week ago.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.608
Except now
we have less than

20:41.641 --> 20:44.977
36 hours before the asteroid
crosses the Rubicon line.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.713
The point of no return.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.282
As expected,
the president is furious

20:49.316 --> 20:50.650
about the Atlas leak.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.653
She's issued a statement
categorically denying.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.054
(sighs)

20:55.087 --> 20:57.724
If she doesn't own this,
apologize...

20:57.757 --> 20:58.991
Apologize?

20:59.025 --> 21:00.259
Sir, all due respect,

21:00.293 --> 21:03.596
that may be the only way to get
Russia back in our good graces.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.933
So we're not just duplicitous,
we're also gutless?

21:08.968 --> 21:10.803
You said the Russian subs

21:10.837 --> 21:13.540
won't be back in firing position
until tomorrow.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.375
Yes, but the odds...

21:15.408 --> 21:17.644
Just tilted in our favor.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.447
We are going to launch
that gravity tractor.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.649
There's only one EmDrive.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.451
They shoot it down, we're done.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.852
The president needs
to acknowledge this.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.354
Claire.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.622
The president has stated clearly

21:29.656 --> 21:31.791
that no such thing
will be happening.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.727
She feels it will diminish us
on the world stage.

21:34.761 --> 21:38.331
So instead we're moving forward
with this suicide mission?

21:38.365 --> 21:40.767
Suicide is waiting
for Russia's permission.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.836
Now, if we launch
before the Russian subs

21:43.870 --> 21:46.105
reach firing range,
we stand a chance.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.107
Now, Tanz has
those launch codes.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.710
I need you to get
them for me. Now.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.714
CLAIRE:
Harris?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.949
This is madness.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.551
We're in this
situation because

21:58.585 --> 22:00.019
the president
won't own what she did,

22:00.052 --> 22:02.455
what she ordered us to do.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.824
Harris.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.862
POTUS is not herself.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.698
What does that mean?

22:11.731 --> 22:12.932
The president

22:12.965 --> 22:15.001
is... ill.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.038
I fear she's not in a position
to make the best decisions.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.973
When were you planning on
sharing this with me?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.775
Senior cabinet
members felt

22:22.809 --> 22:24.877
if the Russians knew,
they'd think we were weak.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.448
We're out of moves.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.750
There is one.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.952
Enlist Darius Tanz.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.754
(scoffs)

22:34.787 --> 22:35.688
He's the one
holding all the cards.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.657
We need to stack the deck
in our favor.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.659
(sighs)

22:39.692 --> 22:41.894
Whatever your feelings
are for him,

22:41.928 --> 22:43.663
you have to
set them aside.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.666
This is our last shot, Harris.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.143
Liam, thanks for seeing me.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.779
Not here. Come on.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.850
AMANDA: Did you send me
that story to sabotage me?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.585
LIAM:
What?

23:05.618 --> 23:07.920
No. I have much more
pressing issues than you.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.989
I know the story
is true, Liam.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.058
I just need a source
to go on record.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.560
You or Darius Tanz,

23:13.593 --> 23:15.728
or someone.
I'm sorry.

23:15.762 --> 23:16.863
It's not gonna happen.
Come on.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.631
My career's hanging by a thread.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.867
(scoffs)

23:20.900 --> 23:22.101
You owe me.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.570
For what?

23:23.603 --> 23:24.937
Screwing up my life?

23:24.971 --> 23:26.439
If you don't want me

23:26.473 --> 23:27.874
to tell your girlfriend
everything...

23:27.907 --> 23:29.041
A-Are you threatening me?

23:29.075 --> 23:30.477
Really?

23:30.510 --> 23:31.778
Amanda.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.112
Jillian.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.581
You're back.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.483
Yeah. And so are you.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.587
Listen, for the record,

23:40.620 --> 23:43.923
that kiss between Liam and me,
it didn't mean anything...

23:46.092 --> 23:48.795
...to me.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.863
It's great to see you both.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.870
The instinct...

23:57.904 --> 24:00.573
to say nothing...

24:00.607 --> 24:02.008
is a good one.

24:08.848 --> 24:09.849
(church bell tolling)

24:09.882 --> 24:11.918
I was able to
run his prints.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.020
His name was
Michael Owens.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.124
It was easier
to compartmentalize

24:18.157 --> 24:19.992
before he had a name.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.828
He has no employment
history after 2012

24:21.861 --> 24:23.563
or a current
address on file.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.865
And this...

24:25.898 --> 24:27.500
was the only identifying
mark on his body.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.868
Tattoo. He was military.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.903
Air Force.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.905
Flew in the same squadron
as someone you know.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.941
Who?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.577
Your boss.
Harris Edwards.

24:39.812 --> 24:43.683
Gracie, if you
ever trusted him,

24:43.716 --> 24:45.552
don't.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.724
TANZ:
Grace,

24:51.758 --> 24:54.594
look who decided
to make a house call.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.932
Hello.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.877
(sirens wailing)

25:10.910 --> 25:12.211
(tires screeching)

25:21.253 --> 25:24.256
Pentagon security is on their
way to confiscate the EmDrive

25:24.290 --> 25:25.958
and transport it
to the launching pad.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.627
We don't have much time
for discussion.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.830
And you're coming to us
for help to try and stop it.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.132
Why should we believe
anything you have to say?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.768
Because right now,
we, the four of us,

25:35.802 --> 25:37.870
are all that's standing between
a lying president,

25:37.904 --> 25:39.639
an unhinged
secretary of defense...

25:39.672 --> 25:41.340
And the end of the world.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.142
(elevator doors open)

25:44.376 --> 25:47.079
Darius, we have visitors.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.051
If you relinquish that EmDrive,
it's over.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.625
Let's go.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.759
(guns click)

26:03.062 --> 26:04.731
Mr. Tanz.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.933
I'm sure the deputy secretary
and Ms. Rayburn

26:06.966 --> 26:09.602
have explained
the situation.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.038
We are going to need that
EmDrive and those launch codes.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.039
Immediately.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.073
If I refuse?

26:14.106 --> 26:15.174
If you refuse,

26:15.207 --> 26:16.743
I'll bring in
the National Guard,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.811
and I'll take your
entire company by force.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.181
(exhales)

26:22.214 --> 26:23.750
Help them load it up.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.251
What? Come on.
You can't be serious.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.153
Liam, just do as I say.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.589
Why fight
the inevitable?

26:33.125 --> 26:34.326
Follow me.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.974
Now, you take care of
your business and...

26:48.007 --> 26:49.776
I'll take of care of mine.

26:55.347 --> 26:59.418
After all their lies,
how can we trust them?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.688
Because, for once,
we want the same thing:

27:01.721 --> 27:05.658
to get the gravity tractor
launched safely.

27:05.692 --> 27:08.761
Tess is working on
the decryption of the phone.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.330
It's a complex web.
We'll know more soon.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.833
I'm not sure
I want to know.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.202
The man who
tried to kill me,

27:16.235 --> 27:19.238
he served in Harris's squadron,
in the Air Force.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.009
Darius, do you think...?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.376
Harris is capable
of a lot of things,

27:24.410 --> 27:27.914
as we both know, but not that.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.181
With you?

27:29.215 --> 27:31.217
(softly):
Yeah.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.919
(sighs)

27:32.952 --> 27:34.220
I don't want you
to be alone.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.388
Grab Zoe; you can stay in
one of the bungalows here.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.791
No. I'm not gonna
live in fear.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.729
Good luck
with this plan.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.263
Let's hope we're smarter
than Calhoun.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.132
We are.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.776
OFFICER:
We're all set. Let's move.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.177
OFFICER 2:
All right, let's go.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.948
Ready. Let's
go, let's go.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.082
(siren chirps)

28:03.115 --> 28:04.216
(truck horn honks)

28:07.153 --> 28:08.955
How'd it go?

28:08.988 --> 28:11.357
Didn't suspect a thing.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.994
Time to reach out
to your friend.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.329
Please, don't ever
call her that.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.068
(cell phone ringing)

28:22.101 --> 28:24.370
(clears throat) Hello?
LIAM: Hey.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.238
It's Liam.
I need you to put me in touch

28:26.272 --> 28:27.306
with your friends at RE/SYST.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.976
Why the hell would I do that?

28:30.009 --> 28:31.878
Because Darius Tanz
will go on the record,

28:31.911 --> 28:33.279
verifying your story.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.282
Uh, give me ten minutes.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.750
Listen,

28:37.784 --> 28:39.318
I'm sorry
what I said to Jillian.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.320
No, you're not.

28:41.353 --> 28:44.190
Look, you'll get what you want
if I get what I want.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.858
(phone beeps)

28:49.361 --> 28:51.363
What's the word from Wallops?

28:51.397 --> 28:54.166
Launch codes are secure,
Mr. Secretary.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.401
The EmDrive
is on board.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.403
All pre-flight
checks are go

28:57.436 --> 28:59.238
for launch commit
on your command.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.773
Proceed.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.474
We are go for launch.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.411
T-COM: T-minus ten seconds
and counting.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.179
Ten, nine,

29:07.213 --> 29:10.249
eight, seven, six,

29:10.282 --> 29:13.319
five, four, three,

29:13.352 --> 29:15.354
two, one.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.455
Ignition.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.191
DEXTER:
We have liftoff.

29:19.225 --> 29:22.294
T-COM: Sir, radar's picking up
an unidentified projectile

29:22.328 --> 29:26.298
on a heading of 270 from
38 degrees, 28 minutes north,

29:26.332 --> 29:28.968
59 degrees, 21 minutes west.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.569
HARRIS:
International waters.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.339
Last known sub in that area
was the Vostov.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.340
The Russians.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.341
Launch countermeasures.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.577
Launch THAAD missiles.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.312
Take that bogey out.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.950
T-COM:
Missiles have been deployed.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.385
Heading toward target.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.888
Time to intercept: 42 seconds.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.990
We're not gonna make it, sir.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.265
Sir, we've lost telemetry.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.403
Get me the president. Now.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.855
DYLAN:
Liam.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.858
I was surprised to hear
you wanted to meet.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.927
I brought a friend.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.198
TANZ:
Nice decor.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.101
Early brick and mortar.
I'm quite fond of the period.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.104
What do you want?

30:38.137 --> 30:40.072
You get right to the point.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.540
I like that.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.543
Liam says you guys are good,

30:44.576 --> 30:48.414
that you possess a certain...
technical sophistication.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.317
We have a proposal for you.

30:58.257 --> 31:01.193
(car alarm chirps)

31:01.227 --> 31:03.195
HARRIS:
Grace.

31:03.229 --> 31:06.298
Sir! You're not to get within
50 feet of Ms. Barrows.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.134
HARRIS: Any idea
what you're doing?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.335
I'm the Deputy Secretary
of Defense.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.471
Get your hands off me.

31:12.504 --> 31:13.906
He's unarmed, ma'am.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.408
Grace, what is this?

31:16.442 --> 31:18.510
It's okay. Just give me
a second, okay?

31:18.544 --> 31:20.212
Thanks.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.918
You're afraid
to be alone with me?

31:33.025 --> 31:35.194
(exhales)

31:35.227 --> 31:37.596
And you thought
I might've been the one

31:37.629 --> 31:40.532
who sent them
to your house?

31:40.566 --> 31:44.570
All the things you did,
in the name of country.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.341
Maybe I was just
another casualty.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.943
Like Carnahan.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.546
How could you even think I'd...

31:54.580 --> 31:57.583
I'd ever authorize
something like that?

32:00.752 --> 32:04.590
The hit man was a member
of your flight squadron

32:04.623 --> 32:06.092
in the Air Force, Harris.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.495
Someone's trying
to make it look as if

32:09.528 --> 32:11.263
I had something to do with this.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.398
And I didn't.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.633
I didn't.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.468
And if you don't know me
well enough by now...

32:16.502 --> 32:19.538
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.542
Are you with him?

32:26.512 --> 32:27.946
Darius?

32:28.747 --> 32:30.582
(knock on window)

32:30.616 --> 32:33.319
Everything all right
in there, Ms. Barrows?

32:33.352 --> 32:35.321
Yeah, thanks.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.763
Thank you for reaching
out to Darius.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.966
Let's hope he succeeds
where the government failed.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.340
(car door closes)

32:54.373 --> 32:56.508
A cyber blackout?

32:56.542 --> 32:59.478
Of Russia's entire satellite
array and power system for...

32:59.511 --> 33:01.013
for 20 minutes?

33:01.047 --> 33:02.481
LIAM: Plus, all their
ground-based radar

33:02.514 --> 33:03.749
and wireless
tracking networks.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.751
Okay, but aren't they
pissed off enough about

33:05.784 --> 33:07.386
Atlas and Chelyabinsk?

33:07.419 --> 33:08.520
TANZ: In this case,
what they don't know

33:08.554 --> 33:09.521
really won't hurt them.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.290
Yeah, but it may hurt us.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.125
Well, not if RE/SYST
is as good as the hype.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.294
"Untraceable, Virtually"--
isn't that your motto?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.428
What's in it for us?

33:16.462 --> 33:17.596
One million.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.531
No. Your money's
no good here.

33:19.565 --> 33:20.599
(computer chirps)

33:20.632 --> 33:21.533
Wait.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.606
Big boss says it is.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.042
Fine.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.543
Money sits
in an escrow account,

33:31.577 --> 33:34.413
transfer to occur
upon delivery of services.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.248
Take it or leave it.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.452
He says take it.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.255
Now, how exactly do you
plan to accomplish this?

33:43.289 --> 33:46.692
There's a heat wave across
Eastern Europe right now.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.261
So, first, we create a series
of rolling brownouts in Moscow

33:49.295 --> 33:50.662
and the surrounding areas.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.597
LIAM:
Like a typical

33:51.630 --> 33:53.432
summer surge in A.C. use.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.634
Right. I have
proprietary software

33:55.667 --> 33:58.337
that will temporarily blind
their satellite grid, so...

34:00.272 --> 34:02.074
I didn't catch your name, son.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.042
And you never will.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.425
ZOE:
Dylan.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.160
I'm in.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.499
(keyboard clicking)

34:27.533 --> 34:29.801
Almost ready, Mr. Tanz.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.370
I got to hand it to you.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.339
Building a decoy
EmDrive, that's...

34:33.372 --> 34:34.706
well-played, sir.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.442
(chuckles)

34:36.475 --> 34:39.211
Meantime, the real EmDrive has
been safely transported here,

34:39.245 --> 34:41.813
and Claire secured
a gravity tractor from NASA.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.516
And you're sure the Russians
can't shoot this one down?

34:44.550 --> 34:46.518
In about 30 seconds,
all of the satellites

34:46.552 --> 34:48.554
that send information to
Russia's subs

34:48.587 --> 34:50.356
and land bases

34:50.389 --> 34:51.657
will go dark.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.091
We hope.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.162
Preflight checks are good.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.763
Mr. Tanz, stand by.

35:00.366 --> 35:05.337
And blackout to commence
in three, two, one.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.276
Did RE/SYST just rip us off?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.478
Breathe, Liam. You're too young
to give yourself an ulcer.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.816
TANZ:
There it is.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.319
Begin protocol.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.423
Now, once the EmDrive kicks in,

35:24.456 --> 35:26.892
the gravity tractor
will head toward the asteroid

35:26.925 --> 35:29.328
at speeds exceeding
40,000 miles per hour,

35:29.361 --> 35:30.762
which is faster than
any man-made object

35:30.796 --> 35:33.299
has ever traveled
in outer space.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.801
Before today, planes have flown,
rockets have been launched,

35:35.834 --> 35:39.338
but no one's ever sent
a working EmDrive into space.

35:39.371 --> 35:42.341
This is one of the greatest
scientific achievements

35:42.374 --> 35:43.709
of all time.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.678
Sir, protocol's engaged.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.414
T-COM:
Ten, nine, eight...

35:48.447 --> 35:51.950
Innovation is not about why,
it's about why not.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.786
...three, two, one.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.555
Ignition.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.493
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
We have liftoff.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.595
Come on.

36:12.238 --> 36:13.539
Come on!

36:21.547 --> 36:24.750
There's still some beauty
left in this world.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.488
What now?

36:29.521 --> 36:33.359
We wait, and we hope.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.339
DYLAN:
16 minutes and holding.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.709
Can I ask you something?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.478
You can always ask.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.712
A million.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.547
Sure, it's a
lot of cheese,

36:55.581 --> 36:57.949
but we've never been
about the cheese.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.918
We're still not.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.454
The big boss wanted
to slip a stealth root key

37:02.488 --> 37:04.523
into the Tanz system somehow,

37:04.556 --> 37:05.857
and this was
our opportunity.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.793
Now we can track
every move he makes,

37:07.826 --> 37:10.228
from this day forward.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.535
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
Second stage engine cutoff

37:16.568 --> 37:18.937
in three, two, one.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.677
Like a butterfly
emerging from its cocoon.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.482
LIAM:
There she is.

37:30.516 --> 37:33.485
FLIGHT DIRECTOR: Payload is
away, waiting on your command

37:33.519 --> 37:34.953
to engage EmDrive, sir.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.625
Engage.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.960
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
Roger.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.933
We have EmDrive thrust, sir.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.770
(laughing softly)

37:55.006 --> 37:56.942
Initial data looks good.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.678
EmDrive is
building velocity.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.915
This is hope.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.417
TANZ:
You're right.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.419
Now we celebrate.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.420
(laughs)

38:08.454 --> 38:10.722
(cheering, applause)

38:14.426 --> 38:16.428
(laughs):
Yes!

38:18.730 --> 38:20.699
Yes!
Yes!

38:20.732 --> 38:23.068
(Grace chuckles)

38:29.641 --> 38:30.876
(grunts)

38:32.444 --> 38:34.079
GRACE:
What a night.

38:34.112 --> 38:36.081
Champagne, anyone?

38:36.114 --> 38:38.083
I-I have to go
and find Jillian.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.719
Go.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.521
(laughs)

38:42.554 --> 38:44.890
Much as I'd love
a fancy bottle of bubbly,

38:44.923 --> 38:46.892
I have a meatloaf

38:46.925 --> 38:48.994
waiting for
me at home.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.597
Uh, my father's
cooking dinner tonight.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.932
He kind of moved in
for the time being.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.001
Good.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.744
Thank you.

39:06.812 --> 39:07.946
Thank you.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.782
For making
all this happen.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.784
There's still some margin
for error up there,

39:12.818 --> 39:14.853
but let's just say
that today was a good day

39:14.886 --> 39:19.691
in our little effort
to save planet Earth.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.793
(laughs softly)

39:21.827 --> 39:24.362
(phone chimes, vibrates)

39:26.765 --> 39:28.166
It's Tess.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.001
She's located
the source of the call.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.940
(excited chatter)

39:37.008 --> 39:38.977
MASON:
Oh, God!

39:39.010 --> 39:39.978
Goal!

39:40.011 --> 39:41.980
You cheated!

39:42.013 --> 39:43.982
You know, cheaters, they-they
don't make the 160.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.017
("Sunrise Sunset"
by Rogov playing)

39:46.051 --> 39:48.019
* Wake up, wake up

39:48.053 --> 39:53.024
* It's the sunrise...

39:53.058 --> 39:55.827
Darius? What?
What is it?

39:55.861 --> 39:57.996
TANZ: Tess is pinpointing
who made that call

39:58.029 --> 40:00.031
to the assassin's phone.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.970
The call came from
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

40:05.003 --> 40:08.440
The White House.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.209
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.044
*

40:13.078 --> 40:15.581
* It's all right

40:16.715 --> 40:18.717
* It's all right

40:19.785 --> 40:20.752
* It's all right...

40:20.786 --> 40:22.020
How was your day, Zoe?

40:22.053 --> 40:23.789
You know,

40:23.822 --> 40:25.223
the usual.

40:25.256 --> 40:28.727
* Oh, it's all right...

40:28.760 --> 40:30.562
You?

40:30.596 --> 40:32.764
* It's all right...

40:32.798 --> 40:34.065
Same.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.802
* It's all right...

40:36.835 --> 40:39.004
(grunts)

40:39.037 --> 40:40.806
*

40:40.839 --> 40:44.109
Well, I really think
I outdid myself this time.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.811
Don't you, Gracie?

40:48.580 --> 40:50.115
* It's all right...

40:50.148 --> 40:52.117
You certainly did, Dad.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.119
*
