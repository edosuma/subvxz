YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT ISN'T FAIR.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:28.071
YOU SHOULD LET YOUR MOTHER
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT EYE.

01:06:28.114 --> 01:06:30.769

DO ME A FAVOR?

01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:34.903
WHEN YOU DREAM TONIGHT,
REMEMBER IT FOR ME.

01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:37.384
WHY? AM I GONNA DREAM
THAT WE'RE MARRIED?

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:42.041
MAYBE I'M CRAZY.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:45.218
AND IF I AM, I NEED
SOME SERIOUS HELP.

01:06:45.262 --> 01:06:48.091
BUT IF I'M NOT,

01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:51.616
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
THIS DREAM, PLEASE.

01:06:51.659 --> 01:06:54.227
JUST DO IT FOR ME, PLEASE.

01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:55.663

01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:58.405
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:08.633
WE'RE GONNA KILL
DUMAS FOR THIS.

01:07:08.676 --> 01:07:11.636
- HEY, BE CAREFUL.
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:15.944
- HI, MISS DIAMOND.
- WELL, IF YOU AREN'T A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:18.295
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY...
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.

01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:20.297
THANK YOU, MOTHER.
WE'LL BE FINE.

WON'T BE IN SCHOOL MONDAY.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.403
THAT'S A REAL GOOD IDEA, PAL...
REAL GOOD.

01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:41.187
BOBBY, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:43.363
DO YOU REALLY, HONESTLY
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
RIGHT... MONEY?

01:08:04.297 --> 01:08:06.256
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU.

OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE'S A
LOT OF FUNNY THINGS ABOUT THIS.

MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND;

I'M IMPRESSED.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

FOR BEING LATE AGAIN.

AND THE TEACHING
AT THAT SCHOOL

HAS DECLINED FASTER THAN
THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:12.512
IT'S RIDICULOUS. THEY DON'T TEACH YOU
ANYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ANYMORE.

THEY TEACH YOU NOTHING

DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM?

TELL HIM WHAT?
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
