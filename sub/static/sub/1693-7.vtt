WEBVTT

00:01.304 --> 00:03.735
Nucky Thompson. You
have appointed

00:03.760 --> 00:07.006
a less-than-enthusiastic
prosecutor to his case.

00:07.030 --> 00:10.136
And if I appointed one who took
Nucky's case more seriously...

00:10.160 --> 00:13.261
Then I'm sure my interest in how you
and your cronies plan to plunder

00:13.285 --> 00:16.276
the veterans bureau
would wane accordingly.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.331
My man there.

00:17.356 --> 00:19.248
- He'll be staying on in the states.
- Why?

00:19.439 --> 00:21.000
I have no stomach
left for it, sir.

00:21.024 --> 00:22.333
Bring him around tomorrow.

00:22.357 --> 00:23.281
Jack Dempsey.

00:23.305 --> 00:24.921
How you feeling about
Carpentier, champ?

00:24.945 --> 00:26.191
I'm gonna knock his block off.

00:26.215 --> 00:28.441
Train here. Fresh sea air...

00:28.465 --> 00:29.665
Let me help you with that.

00:31.312 --> 00:33.606
Always happy to be of service, Mrs.
Schroeder.

00:35.347 --> 00:36.768
It's a girl.

00:37.283 --> 00:40.537
I did this, for us.
That child is for you.

00:40.561 --> 00:42.797
- Don't touch me!
- Rose! Rose!

00:45.994 --> 00:48.566
I've told you of my brother
and sisters in Ireland.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.790
There is a telephone number.

00:51.115 --> 00:53.724
He said Peggy Rohan
died 10 years ago.

00:54.073 --> 00:56.159
- I made a mistake, Nuck.
- All right.

00:56.183 --> 00:59.125
- I need you to get on your knees.
- What?

01:03.207 --> 01:04.673
Enough.

01:04.729 --> 01:06.895
We got speedboats, over a dozen.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.510
Once they make shore in Philly,

01:08.534 --> 01:11.028
the goods are loaded onto
trucks by Waxey's men.

01:11.052 --> 01:12.677
This could be an
opportunity, gentleman.

01:12.701 --> 01:14.200
A hundred grand there, Boychik,

01:14.224 --> 01:15.710
five of which is mine.

01:15.734 --> 01:17.782
- So they'll advance us.
- Sure.

01:17.806 --> 01:19.525
You deliver the load to Chalky

01:19.549 --> 01:21.467
Nucky Thompson is
none the wiser.

01:21.491 --> 01:24.546
And then we meet up. And we
figure a way to take it all.

DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-

03:04.607 --> 03:06.610
- Look at that!
- Give it to him!

03:06.664 --> 03:09.363
- Square on the nose!
- He's got a glass jaw.

03:23.568 --> 03:25.042
Say, champ, champ, champ,

03:25.076 --> 03:27.170
what do you tell people who
say you dodged the draft?

03:27.212 --> 03:28.685
I don't tell them nothing!

03:28.719 --> 03:30.375
'Cause nobody ever
says that to my face.

03:30.409 --> 03:32.403
Does it bug you that
Carpentier is the favorite?

03:32.427 --> 03:34.030
Yeah yeah, he is a
war hero, after all.

03:34.054 --> 03:36.889
On July 2nd, he's going to wish
he had a foxhole to crawl into.

03:36.913 --> 03:39.241
Hey, what about
his secret punch?

03:39.275 --> 03:40.754
You hear he's got
a secret punch?

03:40.778 --> 03:43.057
That's a lot of hooey. Besides,
I got tricks of my own.

03:43.091 --> 03:44.376
What, you got a
secret weapon, champ?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.480
Yeah, matter of fact, I've
been training with a fella

03:46.504 --> 03:48.944
knocked old "carpet ear" out in
the first round over in Paris.

03:48.968 --> 03:50.992
- What?
- Yeah. Hey, doc, bring him out here.

03:51.043 --> 03:52.560
Aw, you betcha, champ!

03:52.584 --> 03:54.123
Wait till you guys
get a load of this.

03:54.152 --> 03:57.664
Go get him, killer!

03:58.990 --> 04:01.502
No hitting below ze belt.

04:01.548 --> 04:04.446
Whoa whoa, is he talking
about my belt or his?

04:04.470 --> 04:07.747
All right, that's it
for today, everybody.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.800
Hey, a fella's gotta
get his beauty rest.

04:12.799 --> 04:14.255
En garde!

04:14.289 --> 04:17.060
Whoa, look out. Ooh!

04:17.101 --> 04:20.062
- Hey, go get them, champ.
- Whoa, don't hit... don't hit me!

04:20.101 --> 04:21.785
How'd I do?

04:21.809 --> 04:23.729
If you lose the fight,
there's always vaudeville.

04:25.046 --> 04:27.006
I'd take a rotten tomato
over a left hook anytime.

04:27.030 --> 04:28.989
Except there ain't no
dough in tomatoes.

04:29.025 --> 04:31.105
Say, I'm wondering if
you'd do me a favor.

04:31.139 --> 04:33.660
I'm sure you've heard we're selling
the fight over the wireless.

04:33.698 --> 04:34.816
Can I get your autograph?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.698
$2.50 a ticket to hear
it as it happens.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.826
They'll be broadcasting
right from ringside.

04:38.866 --> 04:41.029
It'd be a big boost if you
did a little promotion.

04:41.082 --> 04:44.365
Friday at babette's, shake
some hands, wave to the girls.

04:44.418 --> 04:48.207
It's all right by me, especially
the part about the girls.

04:48.256 --> 04:51.384
Uh, as long as doc here
gives the okay, of course.

04:51.426 --> 04:54.631
Considering the good doctor
is pocketing 10% of the take,

04:54.665 --> 04:57.602
- I'm sure he will.
- Two bits for each set of ears?

04:57.648 --> 05:02.103
- That's progress, boys.
- Gents, gents, one more question.

05:02.138 --> 05:04.699
- Save it for next time, Pal.
- This one's for nuck.

05:04.731 --> 05:06.943
What'd you and the attorney
general talk about

05:06.979 --> 05:09.614
at the seaview golf
club on memorial day?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.508
Sand trap... It's a doozy.

05:12.541 --> 05:14.926
Nothing about your
election-rigging case?

05:14.950 --> 05:17.360
Show us that hook, Jack.

05:18.328 --> 05:20.157
Come here, you. Get over here.

05:20.191 --> 05:21.671
I'm gonna feed him

She cried for five
hours straight today.

06:03.428 --> 06:06.377

- Of course I fed her.

06:06.411 --> 06:09.619

She's gone to visit
an aunt in Milwaukee,

06:26.555 --> 06:29.248
according to the neighbors.

06:29.282 --> 06:31.824
You got a, uh,

06:31.872 --> 06:34.952
number for this aunt?

06:36.816 --> 06:38.706
An address?

06:38.730 --> 06:40.641
She will not speak to
me on the telephone.

06:40.675 --> 06:43.299
She will not answer my letters.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.436
We're being tested, rose and I.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.557
And what about me?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.667
I'm sure you're being
tested as well,

06:49.691 --> 06:51.050
in your fashion.

06:51.173 --> 06:54.803
I'm talking about
our arrangement.

06:54.845 --> 06:57.701
Nelson, you owe me money.

06:57.907 --> 07:00.015
Yes, I'm sorry. I don't have it.

07:00.049 --> 07:03.037
You don't have it now?

07:05.773 --> 07:08.905
You don't have it at all?

- I need an answer.

07:23.655 --> 07:27.556
- Extremely penetrating sound.
- It's $3,000.

07:27.765 --> 07:30.848
- That's a large sum.
- It is to me.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.652
Lord knows what I was thinking.

07:34.892 --> 07:38.036
You were conning me?

07:38.070 --> 07:41.715
- You made me go through all this?
- Frankly frankly,

07:41.750 --> 07:44.655
it's impossible to concentrate
under these conditions.

07:44.679 --> 07:49.334
We had an agreement.
You owe me money!

07:49.369 --> 07:53.103
This is your baby.
You bought it!

07:53.157 --> 07:57.273
The kid doesn't
even have a name!

07:57.297 --> 08:00.178
Shut up with the
shouting already.

08:00.212 --> 08:03.268
You shut up!

08:07.082 --> 08:10.213
We gonna start this thing?

08:10.337 --> 08:14.031
- Give it another minute.
- Your grandpa in the woods...

08:14.129 --> 08:16.526
Sammy sabbath from philly?

08:16.566 --> 08:20.006
- Manny. What about him?
- He keeps hocking me for five grand.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.252
- You agreed to advance him.
- You had a gun on me.

08:23.276 --> 08:25.717
I'll cover it.

08:25.741 --> 08:27.838
- As a gesture.
- It's not a favor.

08:27.871 --> 08:30.697
You should probably begin.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.188
Gentlemen,

08:35.212 --> 08:37.375
I want to thank you
all for coming.

08:37.409 --> 08:40.753
It's hard to believe that a
year ago, a year and a half,

08:40.777 --> 08:44.059
- things have changed so much.
- Sure... meyer started shaving.

08:44.094 --> 08:46.037
Kind of my point.

08:46.071 --> 08:49.060
Nucky Thompson, Johnny Torrio,

08:49.094 --> 08:50.809
Rothstein, Waxey Gordon...

08:50.843 --> 08:53.964
They have problems,
they come to us.

08:54.094 --> 08:57.139
- Exactly why we don't need 'em.
- Speak for yourself, Salvatore.

08:57.191 --> 08:59.292
What are you, my priest?

08:59.376 --> 09:02.366
- Back off.
- Charlie, we're here to listen.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.556
As of this moment, the coast
guard in Atlantic city

09:04.590 --> 09:06.460
is in my back pocket.

09:06.695 --> 09:09.105
That puts all of us in a
very unique position...

09:09.139 --> 09:11.313
Gentlemen, sheriff Thompson.

09:13.026 --> 09:15.386
- You start without me?
- How long were we supposed to wait?

09:15.410 --> 09:17.835
You lose the keys to the jail?

09:17.869 --> 09:20.774
Eli, this is Al,

09:20.798 --> 09:23.840
- Charlie and Meyer.
- We've already met.

09:23.874 --> 09:26.761
- Yeah, I remember.
- Not as good as me, I bet.

09:29.339 --> 09:32.790
The men talk. The
geisha retires.

09:37.007 --> 09:38.924
As I was saying,

09:38.958 --> 09:40.796
we have special advantages here.

09:40.898 --> 09:43.003
You send your suppliers
to a friendly port.

09:43.058 --> 09:46.481
We offload, store it, truck
it to you as needed.

09:46.515 --> 09:48.222
With the sheriff as a partner,

09:48.268 --> 09:50.628
there's no limit to
what we can bring in.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.133
No worries with the cops, no
trouble with the hijackers.

09:54.157 --> 09:57.674
Torrio's got suppliers...
Canada, a fella remus in Ohio.

09:57.702 --> 09:59.395
Yeah, and Torrio takes
care of Torrio.

09:59.419 --> 10:01.133
So where does that leave you?

10:02.188 --> 10:03.930
How do you propose
to handle Nucky?

10:03.954 --> 10:04.954
He goes to jail.

10:05.111 --> 10:08.119
I have mayor bader replace
him with some patsy.

10:08.153 --> 10:09.831
They both report to me.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.368
The way this place runs, you
have to keep people happy.

10:12.501 --> 10:15.274
You have hotel owners,
clubs, theaters.

10:15.308 --> 10:17.647
They need to know that
when one boss is gone,

10:17.671 --> 10:19.696
someone else is there
to keep things in line.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.960
They figure that out by the
gat you shove in their mouth.

10:21.984 --> 10:24.584
- I'm tellin' you it's not gonna fly.
- Worked with the sheridans.

10:24.608 --> 10:25.859
The greektown Irish?

10:25.883 --> 10:27.348
This one left the
brains on the wall.

10:27.379 --> 10:28.637
So who doesn't get
their hands dirty?

10:28.661 --> 10:29.919
Are we counting notches now?

10:29.943 --> 10:32.326
- Anytime you want, ciccio.
- Whenever you're ready, sal.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.691
This is not Chicago or New York.
Things are different here.

10:34.725 --> 10:36.158
And the way it works
with Nucky...

10:36.182 --> 10:37.862
the way I say it's gonna
work with Nucky...

10:37.886 --> 10:40.612
Jesus Christ, just kill him.

10:44.854 --> 10:46.706
What, is he king
fucking Neptune?

10:46.740 --> 10:49.925
He's creeping around with
lawyers and politicians

10:49.949 --> 10:52.703
and all of you with this
bullshit pissing match.

10:52.803 --> 10:55.535
Put a bullet in his
head, get it over with.

10:55.592 --> 10:57.724
I'm sick of all this
fucking nut-twisting.

10:57.748 --> 10:59.978
You and I can talk
about it later.

11:00.002 --> 11:01.698
Talk about it now
in front of them.

11:01.742 --> 11:05.189
Look, your thing with him, the
political whattayacall...

11:05.213 --> 11:07.218
- I don't see the angle.
- You don't live here.

11:07.242 --> 11:08.553
That's right, Pal.

11:08.577 --> 11:10.097
So it's a long way
to come for nothing.

11:10.121 --> 11:12.255
Pop him. What's the big deal?

11:12.279 --> 11:14.938
- He's just another old timer.
- So's Arnold Rothstein.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.214
Come to my house,
we'll discuss that.

11:17.238 --> 11:20.376
You would kill your brother?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.888
No. Someone else will.

11:22.912 --> 11:25.705
I'll call Chicago. We'll
get a paisan on the train.

11:25.739 --> 11:28.452
- He comes up, does the job...
- He goes home.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.367
We start making some real dough.

11:30.461 --> 11:32.389
Which is what it's
all about, ain't it?

11:32.423 --> 11:33.917
Well?

11:35.126 --> 11:37.046
You don't like to
keep people waiting.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.251
Make your phone call.

11:56.372 --> 11:58.515
I've been working out
of the post office,

11:58.539 --> 11:59.825
if you can believe it.

11:59.939 --> 12:02.614
The nearest law
library is in Camden.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.671
I'll have one of
the clerks do it.

12:04.787 --> 12:06.249
Yes, sir, I understand.

12:06.273 --> 12:07.833
That will not be an
issue, I assure you.

12:07.966 --> 12:10.245
What in damnation
is going on here?!

12:10.269 --> 12:12.294
Where is agent Sawicki?

12:13.217 --> 12:15.169
Yes, sir, absolutely.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.804
Well, discovery is
just beginning...

12:19.828 --> 12:21.998
Who is this woman at my desk?

12:23.196 --> 12:25.248
She's on the phone with
the attorney general.

12:25.362 --> 12:28.219
Of course. Thank you, sir.
I'll be in touch.

12:32.220 --> 12:35.169
Agent van Alden, I presume.
Esther Randolph,

12:35.345 --> 12:39.426
chief investigator Lathrop, and
my clerks Pratt and Halsey.

12:40.648 --> 12:42.863
- What are you doing here?
- Beg pardon?

12:42.897 --> 12:44.976
That is my station.
This is my office.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.875
The investigation necessitated
ad hoc arrangements.

12:47.899 --> 12:49.543
Ad hoc?

12:49.706 --> 12:52.345
I am the head of prohibition
enforcement for this city.

12:52.446 --> 12:56.055
And I am the assistant U.S. Attorney
prosecuting enoch Thompson.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.369
That's your stuff over there.

13:02.272 --> 13:05.199
Does the justice department
not give advance notice?

13:05.223 --> 13:07.158
You and your colleague
will practice discretion

13:07.269 --> 13:08.909
with regard to what you
hear in this room.

13:09.008 --> 13:11.802
- Do you understand, agent van Alden?
- I took an oath.

13:11.826 --> 13:13.135
As did I.

13:15.193 --> 13:17.511
Now if you'll excuse me.

13:29.264 --> 13:31.590
In his testimony,
confidential witness ♪2

13:31.691 --> 13:33.933
claims that ballot boxes
with non-republican votes

13:33.957 --> 13:36.359
were tossed into absecon bay.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.867
Take Halsey, nose
around out there.

13:39.054 --> 13:41.370
It's a long shot,
but you never know.

13:41.394 --> 13:43.548
Where's a good place
to buy wading boots?

13:43.687 --> 13:46.473
- You'll be eaten alive.
- In the bay?

13:46.585 --> 13:49.012
By Nucky Thompson. The
charges won't stick.

13:49.046 --> 13:51.357
And your lack of confidence
is based upon what?

13:51.391 --> 13:54.608
That the scales of justice are
weighted down with graft.

13:54.726 --> 13:57.899
My, that is shocking.

14:06.698 --> 14:09.765
This does not belong to me.

14:24.507 --> 14:26.506
Thank you.

14:37.273 --> 14:39.576
How much are you charging
for those things?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.380
Only because you're pretty.

14:44.422 --> 14:46.473
I'll fix it, don't you worry.

14:46.527 --> 14:47.564
Come on.

14:47.598 --> 14:50.019
Nice and light... yes.

14:50.065 --> 14:52.197
Nice and sharp.

14:57.312 --> 14:58.714
This one.

14:58.738 --> 15:00.178
A good piece of
material from Sicily.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.515
- Very good.
- How much you want for that?

15:08.558 --> 15:10.895
Jimmy's the one
that was talking.

15:11.112 --> 15:14.260
Can't keep his trap
shut, that one.

16:02.214 --> 16:04.660
- I'm sorry?
- Didn't I say it right?

16:04.694 --> 16:06.669
She's been practicing all day.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.501
- Is it Beth?
- The same.

16:09.525 --> 16:13.428
- And little Aylesh.
- Oh... don't call me that.

16:13.550 --> 16:15.714
What should I call you?

16:16.578 --> 16:17.828
Juliet!

16:18.748 --> 16:20.878
Very well.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.020
Eamoinn, she's here.

16:26.044 --> 16:28.373
Nuala.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.482
Do you not know me?

16:32.346 --> 16:34.947
- You're Margaret.
- Yes.

16:35.065 --> 16:37.384
Who else on earth would you be?

16:42.650 --> 16:44.562
Eamoinn.

16:46.126 --> 16:47.986
Hello, Peg.

16:50.778 --> 16:53.910
Thank you for replying
to my letter.

16:54.025 --> 16:57.243
Couldn't leave you out there
wandering so far from home.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.447
Could we?

16:59.506 --> 17:02.265
You can let her cross
the threshold, so.

17:18.473 --> 17:21.705
It's taffy, right
from the boardwalk.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.070
Oh aye. They have the
same at Luna Park.

17:24.105 --> 17:26.538
Ahem.

17:26.561 --> 17:28.509
I'm sure it's grand.

17:33.205 --> 17:35.757
We'll hug then.

17:48.751 --> 17:52.264
There's dinner... roast and
potatoes, so come along.

17:52.298 --> 17:55.127
Take your sister's hat now.
Make her feel at ease.

18:01.836 --> 18:04.175
See the little bee in the rose?

18:10.644 --> 18:13.780
She's like you, Peg,
always dashing about.

18:14.898 --> 18:17.531
Name's Esther Randolph,
from California.

18:17.743 --> 18:21.464
U.S.C. Graduate. 10 years
as a public defender

18:21.495 --> 18:24.591
representing draft
dodgers and prostitutes.

18:24.617 --> 18:26.775
And she works for
Harry Daugherty?

18:26.871 --> 18:30.481
Yeah, caught the governor's
eye in California,

18:30.505 --> 18:32.637
joined the u.S.
Attorney's office.

18:32.671 --> 18:34.797
I don't think Daugherty
could get rid of her.

18:34.998 --> 18:38.990
- Why the fuck not?
- Someone has to look honest.

18:40.955 --> 18:43.892
- Transfer to federal court.
- I've been waiting for this.

18:43.926 --> 18:46.125
It was your idea. What
do you want me to say?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.378
More to the point is what
do you want me to say?

18:48.455 --> 18:51.035
If the attorney general
can't help you, how can I?

18:51.069 --> 18:53.147
I'm not the only one in town
with something to lose.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.573
But you are the one that
they're coming after.

18:55.607 --> 18:59.310
The commodore's in a diaper.
O'Neill's off hiding.

18:59.344 --> 19:01.832
Neary, Boyd, Paddy Ryan...

19:01.856 --> 19:04.192
If you can't work something on
them and get me out of this,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.184
what the fuck am I
paying you for?

19:06.218 --> 19:08.409
For sitting here while you
talk to me like that.

19:10.386 --> 19:13.153
I am so sorry, but you
have two visitors.

19:13.187 --> 19:15.197
Is this a mirage
sitting before me?

19:16.450 --> 19:17.902
I'm in the middle of something.

19:18.151 --> 19:20.202
I realize that.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.868
Ah ahem.

19:23.892 --> 19:26.355
I'll leave you to
your next meeting.

19:40.369 --> 19:44.184
You and I have not seen each other
since may 23rd of last year.

19:50.070 --> 19:52.596
Don't start that way.

19:53.548 --> 19:55.308
Shh shh shh.

20:00.712 --> 20:04.222
I'm sorry, Lucy.
Congratulations.

20:04.396 --> 20:07.791
- You look glowing.
- I look like shit.

20:09.766 --> 20:13.038
She is kinda cute though, huh?

20:13.062 --> 20:16.221
10 toes and everything.

20:23.954 --> 20:26.911
I thought I'd try
shaking you down,

20:26.935 --> 20:30.013
but I knew I'd never swing it.

20:30.047 --> 20:33.429
And anyhow, that's no way
for a mother to act.

20:33.463 --> 20:35.332
I'm glad you're
taking it seriously.

20:35.438 --> 20:37.781
I'm taking it very seriously.

20:37.815 --> 20:40.302
I mean look at her.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.828
She's just a little
scoop of ice cream.

20:47.755 --> 20:51.106
You and I had some good times,

20:51.331 --> 20:53.743
didn't we, daddy?

20:53.771 --> 20:57.117
You and me? Sure we did.

20:57.141 --> 21:00.191
I always knew what I
was supposed to do.

21:00.237 --> 21:04.210
Every day, just wake
up and make you happy.

21:05.456 --> 21:07.411
Things change. You know that.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.692
Sure I do.

21:09.727 --> 21:14.785
Now there's someone else
I gotta make happy.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.950
And she'll always be mine.

21:19.042 --> 21:21.703
That's the best part of it all.

21:21.753 --> 21:24.131
You're going to do a swell job.

21:25.432 --> 21:28.071
I really want to.

21:28.095 --> 21:30.344
Which is why...

21:30.368 --> 21:32.312
I need money.

21:33.843 --> 21:35.704
Isn't there a father?

21:35.728 --> 21:38.865
Doesn't there have to be?

21:38.899 --> 21:41.434
You don't know who he is.

21:41.673 --> 21:44.698
Yeah, I know.

21:44.732 --> 21:47.255
I guess you might too.

21:48.259 --> 21:50.127
You understand the reason

21:50.156 --> 21:52.058
for this additional deposition, Mr.
Neary?

21:52.113 --> 21:53.819
'Cause it's federal now?

21:53.843 --> 21:55.571
Speak into the machine, please.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.360
I do understand.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.332
And your sworn testimony
will be used as a basis

21:59.480 --> 22:01.401
for prosecuting Mr. Thompson.

22:02.765 --> 22:05.763
The dictaphone can't
hear you nod.

22:06.619 --> 22:08.116
I mean yes.

22:08.212 --> 22:11.744
In your former testimony, you
mentioned cash for votes,

22:11.778 --> 22:13.404
multiple casting of ballots...

22:13.438 --> 22:15.145
Yep.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.875
Mr. Neary, you were
arrested last march

22:16.899 --> 22:19.664
for the storage of illegal
alcohol with intent to sell.

22:19.691 --> 22:21.357
I paid my debt on that.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.179
A $500 fine bargained
down to $50.

22:24.883 --> 22:27.483
- Quite a forgiving judge.
- Special agent van Alden.

22:27.530 --> 22:29.104
What's that got
to do with Nucky?

22:29.139 --> 22:31.380
Consider this your
chance to illuminate me.

22:31.429 --> 22:34.357
No no no no. I had a deal
with the other prosecutor.

22:34.391 --> 22:35.750
That deal is null and void.

22:35.784 --> 22:38.086
I can make your life quite
difficult, Mr. Neary.

22:38.119 --> 22:41.047
In fact I might enjoy it.

22:41.081 --> 22:43.202
I understand. Right away.

22:44.607 --> 22:46.305
A situation has arisen.

22:46.352 --> 22:49.452
I'll return as soon as possible.

23:07.601 --> 23:10.079
Did you take a boat here, miss?

23:10.113 --> 23:11.681
She's not a miss, Aylesh.

23:11.795 --> 23:15.119
- She's our Peg of old, just.
- I took the train.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.813
You can't take a
train from Ireland.

23:17.837 --> 23:20.288
I live in Atlantic city.

23:20.404 --> 23:23.156
- What do you do there?
- I look after my little ones.

23:23.191 --> 23:25.921
- You've children now, Peg?
- Theodore is seven

23:25.955 --> 23:28.816
- and Emily four.
- American names.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.191
- They're quite the patriots.
- And the father?

23:32.215 --> 23:36.169
- You've not mentioned him.
- My husband hans.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.715
He passed last year.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.237
A widow so soon?

23:41.261 --> 23:43.563
I'm going to cry.

23:43.628 --> 23:45.987
You've a good heart, Nuala.

23:46.011 --> 23:49.357
- And live how?
- Pardon?

23:49.381 --> 23:51.178
Well, how do you live?

23:51.238 --> 23:54.339
To come to New York on a jaunt
with your children behind.

23:54.373 --> 23:56.932
- They're being looked after.
- Who by?

23:56.966 --> 23:58.272
Eamoinn.

23:58.447 --> 24:01.147
A woman I pay.

24:01.337 --> 24:04.090
- Well, there's a bit of luxury.
- And why not, if she can?

24:04.124 --> 24:06.595
No reason.

24:08.249 --> 24:10.361
Ach, you've bags of time.

24:10.385 --> 24:14.181
- He's on a night crew.
- Digging the fourth avenue line.

24:14.216 --> 24:16.871
- That's the subway.
- Nuala's at sewing,

24:16.895 --> 24:19.187
beside a hundred other girls.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.152
Beth presses in a laundry.

24:21.186 --> 24:23.493
Aylesh is in school.

24:23.517 --> 24:25.909
They send an officer around
if we don't let her go.

24:26.022 --> 24:29.202
I know you work hard, Eamoinn.

24:29.317 --> 24:31.088
We're as you see us.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.934
I could offer help.

24:39.031 --> 24:40.930
We haven't asked.

24:46.873 --> 24:48.897
Beth made a trifle.

24:48.932 --> 24:51.175
Oh, there's nothing
like a bit of sweet.

24:54.186 --> 24:57.386
Keep your eyes closed.

25:02.456 --> 25:05.069
When did you start
getting modest?

25:05.103 --> 25:07.171
This isn't a flattering light.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.005
Men don't have to worry
about these things.

25:11.478 --> 25:14.100
All right.

25:14.214 --> 25:16.314
Ready for your judgment.

25:18.566 --> 25:20.328
Meeting someone?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.129
Just some girls from
the beaux arts.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.683
They'll clock every wrinkle.

25:24.717 --> 25:27.839
You don't get old, ma.

25:31.958 --> 25:34.578
Remember summers on the beach?

25:34.602 --> 25:37.096
People thought I
was your brother.

25:37.130 --> 25:39.176
We belong here.

25:39.317 --> 25:43.197
It wouldn't be right
anywhere else.

25:43.231 --> 25:46.100
Do you know what
happens tomorrow?

25:46.134 --> 25:48.933
It's not important.

25:50.769 --> 25:53.154
It is to me.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.624
A man's gonna get off a train.

25:57.451 --> 26:00.064
He's gonna walk up
to Nucky Thompson

26:00.098 --> 26:02.649
and he's gonna put
a bullet in him...

26:04.187 --> 26:08.146
Right here, just
because I said so.

26:11.219 --> 26:13.726
- What do you think about that?
- I think

26:13.760 --> 26:16.075
the world's going to find out

26:16.109 --> 26:18.488
what kind of man
it's dealing with.

26:18.512 --> 26:20.303
And if I call it off?

26:21.727 --> 26:23.703
Your friends wouldn't like that.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.346
They don't care what
happens to Nucky.

26:26.381 --> 26:29.503
No, but they are watching you...

26:29.565 --> 26:31.368
Very closely.

26:31.392 --> 26:34.103
They're delightful boys, dear...

26:34.137 --> 26:36.614
Colorful and ambitious,

26:36.766 --> 26:41.023
but I'd never make the mistake of
letting them see me be indecisive.

26:41.047 --> 26:42.882
And that's why he dies?

26:49.108 --> 26:51.628
This isn't what we
talked about, ma.

26:52.709 --> 26:55.819
Well, we weren't
being honest then.

26:55.843 --> 26:58.327
Now we are.

26:58.449 --> 27:00.667
I don't want to do this.

27:00.701 --> 27:02.849
It's already done.

27:03.030 --> 27:05.526
It was done when you
gave the order.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.695
The rest is just bookkeeping.

27:08.729 --> 27:11.549
And you can't bother with that.

27:14.025 --> 27:16.393
Make me proud of you.

27:32.579 --> 27:35.161
Lucy, would you be
so kind as to give

27:35.195 --> 27:38.161
agent van Alden and
myself a moment alone?

27:49.724 --> 27:51.185
I didn't know what else to...

27:51.219 --> 27:52.889
We'll discuss this at home...

27:53.057 --> 27:54.858
Dear.

27:59.468 --> 28:01.400
If there was ever a time...

28:01.424 --> 28:02.964
No, thank you.

28:03.010 --> 28:04.849
Fair enough.

28:07.085 --> 28:10.121
First and foremost,

28:10.181 --> 28:12.196
here's to you.

28:12.230 --> 28:15.808
It is after all a blessed
event in the life of any man.

28:15.870 --> 28:16.870
What do you want?

28:16.894 --> 28:19.398
This actually might be a
good time to charm me.

28:19.433 --> 28:21.606
Why? Does that make
blackmailing easier?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.918
I don't judge people.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.609
I help them.

28:25.643 --> 28:29.035
Perhaps you can see the value
of that more than you once did.

28:29.059 --> 28:31.596
And what do you propose
to help me with?

28:31.661 --> 28:33.633
Where to begin?

28:33.657 --> 28:37.645
Supporting a wife, a
mistress, a baby girl,

28:37.669 --> 28:39.505
all on a government salary?

28:39.791 --> 28:41.516
How do you do it?

28:41.601 --> 28:45.290
My financial arrangements
are none of your concern.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.356
Sadly true.

28:47.420 --> 28:50.266
My concern is Esther Randolph.

28:50.303 --> 28:52.392
I want to know everything...

28:52.426 --> 28:54.767
Who she talks to, what they say,

28:54.801 --> 28:57.525
what's on every scrap of paper
that comes across her desk.

28:57.761 --> 29:00.350
She renews her subscription
to "Vogue" magazine,

29:00.374 --> 29:02.537
I want to know about it.

29:04.650 --> 29:07.818
- And in exchange?
- Your budget problems go away.

29:07.842 --> 29:09.949
And no questions asked

29:09.983 --> 29:12.511
about how you've managed
to afford this up to now.

29:14.768 --> 29:16.517
What's her name?

29:16.552 --> 29:18.838
What?

29:18.862 --> 29:21.048
Your little girl.

29:21.072 --> 29:24.195
She doesn't have one yet.

29:25.649 --> 29:27.478
Well, you can't go wrong

29:27.502 --> 29:29.675
picking something
from the Bible.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.300
Just think it over.

29:32.351 --> 29:34.811
That doesn't cost anything.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.476
And what I gave Lucy... A
gift, no strings attached.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.308
You gave her money?

29:41.342 --> 29:44.326
Tea's on, if you
still drink that.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.468
Never say no to some Barry's.

29:46.502 --> 29:48.642
We'll talk a bit
first, Peg and I.

29:49.797 --> 29:51.824
Let's look in on poor Mrs.
Gillibrand.

29:51.936 --> 29:54.852
- Do we have to?
- It's the Christian thing.

30:05.228 --> 30:07.893
- Fag?
- No, thank you.

30:08.943 --> 30:11.578
I'm not as American
as you thought.

30:16.520 --> 30:20.876
Mam's in the earth, so
there's news for you.

30:20.910 --> 30:23.262
Martin Hennessey wrote me.

30:23.314 --> 30:27.006
The cousin in America. You
kept up with him at least.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.411
She's in the Keel parish yard?

30:30.517 --> 30:33.369
Right beside da.

30:33.421 --> 30:35.662
And not at each other's
throats for once.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.934
She asked for you...

30:40.042 --> 30:42.357
At the last.

30:42.391 --> 30:45.181
I told her you'd be coming home.

30:45.455 --> 30:47.987
What else could I say?

30:52.029 --> 30:54.364
Will you weep, Peg?

30:55.788 --> 30:57.423
Now that it doesn't matter?

30:58.859 --> 31:00.396
I did what I had to.

31:00.430 --> 31:02.649
Can't hear ya.

31:02.683 --> 31:04.808
I did what I had to.

31:10.817 --> 31:12.722
So we all think to ourselves.

31:12.756 --> 31:15.128
Would you have seen me off
to the Magdalene sisters

31:15.163 --> 31:16.890
and broken in the workhouse?

31:16.924 --> 31:19.099
The priest judged
it fit correction.

31:19.123 --> 31:21.090
What makes it right for
others and not you?

31:21.228 --> 31:23.927
What makes it right for anyone?

31:23.961 --> 31:25.950
Would you wish it upon Nuala?

31:25.984 --> 31:28.058
Beth? Aylesh?

31:28.092 --> 31:31.429
Or am I the only sinner
you've ever met?

31:35.146 --> 31:37.337
Who was the father?

31:38.579 --> 31:41.242
You can tell me now.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.452
Douglas Walton.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.960
The barrister's boy.

31:47.559 --> 31:50.827
- You must have known.
- I'm blind when it comes to that.

31:54.821 --> 31:56.635
Did he force himself

31:56.759 --> 31:58.950
as you claimed?

32:04.007 --> 32:06.990
A son seven and
your daughter four.

32:09.978 --> 32:12.165
I miscarried on the crossing.

32:15.129 --> 32:16.961
Then I'm sorry.

32:28.921 --> 32:32.496
- What's that for?
- To return what I stole.

32:32.530 --> 32:35.379
It was mam you took
it from, not me.

32:35.414 --> 32:37.317
Meant for your passage here.

32:37.341 --> 32:39.243
Is that what brought
you to Brooklyn?

32:39.267 --> 32:42.277
To return a debt?

32:42.395 --> 32:45.035
To be among those who know me.

32:53.542 --> 32:55.766
That was quick.

32:55.790 --> 32:58.035
She wants me to pick up
3 lbs of pig trotters.

32:58.069 --> 33:01.691
Then you'd best oblige her
before the butcher closes.

33:03.972 --> 33:07.157
Can't we have some trifle first?
Please?

33:17.561 --> 33:19.693
This is a bad idea.

33:19.717 --> 33:21.973
Don't you trust me, Charles?

33:22.061 --> 33:24.390
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:24.452 --> 33:26.936
Then I'll just sew
up my dress and go.

33:35.200 --> 33:38.188
I'm gonna whip you through the
mud like a filly at Belmont.

33:52.259 --> 33:54.537

34:55.224 --> 34:57.230

34:57.297 --> 34:59.392
She had to pick up some formula.

34:59.532 --> 35:03.427
I said we had plenty of milk,
but she's very particular.

35:03.451 --> 35:07.148

35:07.182 --> 35:09.152

36:29.367 --> 36:31.519
- Her man pays for it.
- Beth.

36:31.543 --> 36:34.490
Well, she's got one. Don't you?

36:34.599 --> 36:37.669
- What's he like?
- He's...

36:37.693 --> 36:39.887
Very mysterious.

36:39.921 --> 36:42.201
And very powerful.

36:42.235 --> 36:43.874
He has minions.

36:43.898 --> 36:45.559
What's that when it's at home?

36:45.593 --> 36:49.344
It means people do his bidding
or they pay the price.

36:50.461 --> 36:53.416
- Don't they?
- Yes.

36:53.450 --> 36:55.577
With a snap of the finger.

36:56.594 --> 36:59.638
But he has a secret tragedy.

36:59.858 --> 37:02.267
His heart was broken.

37:02.301 --> 37:04.749
And he'll never let
anyone near it again.

37:04.783 --> 37:07.155
Where are you getting that from?

37:07.190 --> 37:09.044
You with your stories.

37:09.068 --> 37:10.943
She's always got her
nose in a book.

37:12.269 --> 37:13.947
I'll send you some
if you'd like.

37:13.971 --> 37:17.135
- Would that be all right?
- Can she?

37:17.256 --> 37:19.822
You'll need to ask eamoinn.

37:25.812 --> 37:28.450
Well, think of us now and then.

37:28.482 --> 37:32.690
- Three hours to Atlantic city.
- Luck to you, peg.

37:32.714 --> 37:35.447
After all these years.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.674
I was only joking with you...

37:58.708 --> 38:00.468
About the man.

38:00.671 --> 38:02.698
He must be very nice, really.

38:02.918 --> 38:06.150
Yes. He can be.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.503
And you're my sister.

38:08.625 --> 38:11.680
I'm Margaret Catherine

38:11.814 --> 38:14.677
Sheila rohan.

38:16.178 --> 38:18.489
How do you do?

38:18.523 --> 38:20.875
Aylesh!

38:20.908 --> 38:22.709
To bed with you.

38:22.743 --> 38:25.224
- Do I have to?
- I'm off to work.

38:25.248 --> 38:27.708
You'll not keep your
sisters up all night.

38:34.214 --> 38:37.511
Send me books. I like
anything with a horse in it.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.919
Deborah...

38:53.739 --> 38:55.872
Hannah.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.528
Abigail.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.361
It wouldn't be a bad idea to
start tailing Nucky Thompson.

39:39.398 --> 39:40.983
How close?

39:41.007 --> 39:42.887
You don't have to hide
behind the potted plants,

39:42.911 --> 39:44.804
but I would like a fuller
picture of exactly...

39:44.838 --> 39:46.541
Mrs. Randolph.

39:49.622 --> 39:52.051
Miss.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.859
May we speak privately?

40:07.597 --> 40:09.259
Ahem.

40:18.222 --> 40:20.173
I am a married man.

40:21.637 --> 40:23.505
There goes my dream.

40:26.377 --> 40:30.345
Last autumn, under great duress,

40:30.379 --> 40:34.342
my self-discipline
was compromised.

40:37.107 --> 40:39.194
I have a daughter
born out of wedlock.

40:39.278 --> 40:42.697
Surely you can speak to
a minister about this.

40:42.766 --> 40:46.471
I bare my soul not for
forgiveness nor introspection.

40:46.505 --> 40:49.053
I admit to these
sins so you know

40:49.165 --> 40:51.839
that I am, in my heart,

40:51.947 --> 40:53.845
honest.

41:03.269 --> 41:05.278
This is a file

41:05.312 --> 41:08.546
I've kept on Nucky Thompson
for the past 16 months.

41:11.118 --> 41:12.920
It runs the gamut

41:13.136 --> 41:16.382
from bootlegging, gambling,
vice, extortion,

41:16.416 --> 41:19.516
up to and including murder.

41:24.023 --> 41:28.266
And you've been sitting on this
information for what reason?

41:28.300 --> 41:32.223
I was ordered by my supervisor
to focus on illegal alcohol.

41:37.577 --> 41:41.509
And you will testify to the
accusations made in this file?

41:43.740 --> 41:45.307
I will.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.771
Well, this could prove useful.

41:50.806 --> 41:53.693
That's all that matters to me.

41:55.084 --> 41:57.015
Agent van Alden?

41:57.049 --> 41:59.322
Your domestic situation...

41:59.440 --> 42:00.820
We'll get that sorted out.

42:00.910 --> 42:03.223
Just don't go telling everyone.

42:14.534 --> 42:16.744
Just here. Thank you.

42:18.390 --> 42:20.302
Olly olly oxen free!

42:27.459 --> 42:29.844
- Go ahead.
- You fancy this one?

42:34.811 --> 42:36.605
Thank you very much.

42:38.638 --> 42:41.950
- You haven't read it?
- No.

42:41.979 --> 42:44.779
I hope you like it.
And when you finish,

42:44.817 --> 42:47.071
you'll tell me all about it.

42:47.105 --> 42:49.200
How?

42:49.232 --> 42:52.367
You'll write me and
I'll write you back.

42:52.410 --> 42:55.212
We'll have a secret
correspondence.

42:55.249 --> 42:58.601
- That'd be a good crack.
- What's that mean?

42:58.625 --> 43:01.495
Do you not know it?
Just something fun.

43:01.546 --> 43:04.334
Mam would say it always.

43:04.380 --> 43:06.503
What was she like?

43:07.798 --> 43:09.454
You don't remember her?

43:13.949 --> 43:16.104
The horse doesn't die, does it?

43:16.128 --> 43:19.581
- No.
- Because I wouldn't like that.

43:21.869 --> 43:25.256
You can visit me, you know?
Over the summer.

43:25.356 --> 43:27.235
There's no end of things to do

43:27.343 --> 43:29.999
and you'd meet your
niece and nephew.

43:30.962 --> 43:34.113
I'm an aunt. That's
funny, isn't it?

43:34.147 --> 43:35.201
It is rather.

43:35.260 --> 43:37.344
- Morning.
- And we can...

43:40.451 --> 43:42.684
Good morning.

43:44.014 --> 43:46.598
What have you there?

43:46.638 --> 43:48.676
I brought aylesh a book.

43:48.850 --> 43:51.866
Oh aye. She's keen on those.

43:51.890 --> 43:56.388
- I'll make your breakfast.
- Go and read.

43:56.412 --> 43:58.876
That's what you
want to do anyway.

43:58.900 --> 44:00.981
Away with you now.

44:11.996 --> 44:15.145
- How was your work?
- I thought you were off in your car.

44:15.179 --> 44:17.857
She's my sister too.

44:17.881 --> 44:20.053
And you'll rescue her, will you?

44:20.077 --> 44:24.171
- To ease your mind?
- Must you hate me so, eamoinn?

44:24.205 --> 44:26.062
I don't hate you.

44:26.086 --> 44:28.201
I don't feel much
about you at all.

44:34.262 --> 44:36.538
I can't accept the money.

44:36.571 --> 44:38.515
I don't know where it's from.

44:40.545 --> 44:43.578
- You're honest, are you?
- I don't ask for trouble.

44:43.602 --> 44:45.343
Never take more than you need.

44:45.533 --> 44:49.846
Never talk back to the priest
or the boss or the policeman.

44:49.873 --> 44:52.463
Never question.

44:52.581 --> 44:54.324
Never make a fuss.

44:54.348 --> 44:58.414
Never dare to stand up for me,
your own flesh and blood,

44:58.451 --> 45:02.822
who begged you for help when
she'd nowhere else to turn.

45:02.846 --> 45:06.679
- And you're proud of it.
- You did as you wanted, peg.

45:06.793 --> 45:08.805
You always have.

45:08.849 --> 45:11.289
Nothing you bring and nothing
you buy will change that.

45:11.313 --> 45:14.395
- I'll make her life better.
- The way you've made yours?

45:16.322 --> 45:19.654
You'll go now, back
to your own place

45:19.688 --> 45:22.031
and leave us be.

45:22.065 --> 45:24.592
There's no one here
who knows you.

45:44.134 --> 45:47.690
Don't miss out on the biggest
story of the century.

45:47.797 --> 45:50.452
Dempsey defends the title and...

45:54.473 --> 45:56.933
- Did Owen call?
- No, sir.

45:56.967 --> 45:59.589
But Mrs. schroeder's on her
way back from New York.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.468
I'm taking the children
to the beach with Katy.

46:08.749 --> 46:11.836
- Operator.
- Get me the ritz.

46:11.958 --> 46:15.775
- Ritz Carlton.
- Myra, ring my suite.

46:15.942 --> 46:18.712
- Mr. Thompson's suite.
- Eddie, have you heard from Owen?

46:18.746 --> 46:21.371
Nucky, not yet. I was just...

46:21.406 --> 46:24.101
- Well, come get me. I'm late.
- Of course. I was...

46:29.489 --> 46:31.147
Uh, Billy.

46:31.171 --> 46:32.850
Eh, he never picks up the stuff.

46:32.966 --> 46:34.962
That's Billy.

46:34.996 --> 46:37.769
It's a crying shame, I
tell ya, about him.

46:45.854 --> 46:48.170
Here you go.

47:05.693 --> 47:08.190
Is it del grogan?

47:10.066 --> 47:12.797
- Do I know you?
- It's Owen sleater.

47:12.821 --> 47:15.188
Sean's cousin from dunmurry.

47:15.212 --> 47:17.889
That pimple on the
arse of the lord?

47:17.953 --> 47:21.729
Quiet town on a Saturday night.

47:21.847 --> 47:23.817
Every other night of
the week as well.

47:23.932 --> 47:25.902
Won't dispute it.

47:29.564 --> 47:31.535
On the halligan side?

47:31.569 --> 47:33.301
How's that?

47:33.335 --> 47:35.053
The relation.

47:35.293 --> 47:37.579
Ah no no. We're all
the cavanaughs.

47:37.603 --> 47:39.910
You're desi's boys?

47:41.920 --> 47:44.042
God rest his soul.

47:45.232 --> 47:47.157
That was bad luck.

47:49.044 --> 47:50.976
It was the black and tans.

47:52.732 --> 47:55.792
- I stayed out of that.
- There's a fight that'll never end.

47:55.859 --> 47:58.761
- They're welcome to it.
- Yeah.

48:00.083 --> 48:02.743
Still, free and clear
here though, aren't we?

48:05.855 --> 48:07.950
Stars and stripes forever.

48:14.119 --> 48:17.147
- Buy you another?
- Next time.

48:20.016 --> 48:22.662
Do me the honor. I...

48:24.117 --> 48:26.603
I miss a bit of home,
still and all.

48:29.135 --> 48:32.671
- Whiskey then?
- Two.

48:32.717 --> 48:36.324
- Coming up.
- Off for a slash first.

50:06.259 --> 50:08.088
Shhh.

50:08.152 --> 50:10.191
Shhh.

50:10.225 --> 50:13.346
Sally, get back here.

50:40.884 --> 50:44.188
Lead me on a merry chase
these five months,

50:44.214 --> 50:46.586
you traitorous fuck!

50:58.435 --> 51:00.991
A woman's baking a pie
when she calls out

51:01.095 --> 51:04.426
to her husband in the next room,
"darling, do you want a piece?"

51:04.450 --> 51:06.898
Fella walks into the kitchen.
Wife looks at him

51:06.932 --> 51:10.673
and she says, "honey, put
your pants back on!"

51:12.910 --> 51:14.629
After this song you can start.

51:14.658 --> 51:18.250
And don't forget to mention
radio corporation of America.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.480
How could I forget, doc?

51:20.514 --> 51:22.735
You wrote it down in my speech.

51:31.316 --> 51:33.266
How are ya?

51:35.625 --> 51:38.609
Good afternoon,
ladies and gents.

51:40.505 --> 51:42.326
"For those of you who...

51:42.493 --> 51:45.389
Don't know me"?

51:45.498 --> 51:48.490
I'm Jack dempsey,

51:48.549 --> 51:51.142
heavyweight champ of the world.

51:57.381 --> 52:00.413
You, sir, you might have heard.

52:00.526 --> 52:02.904
- Madam, how about you?
- Whoo hoo!

52:02.928 --> 52:04.850
Well, I know everyone
else here has heard.

52:05.022 --> 52:07.565
On July 2nd, I'm gonna
be in Jersey city

52:07.683 --> 52:10.570
beatin' the tar out
of George Carpentier.

52:12.699 --> 52:16.828
Of course, there are some who think
it will be the other way around,

52:16.862 --> 52:19.231
with me taking the licking.

52:19.336 --> 52:21.160
Ever heard such a thing?

52:21.281 --> 52:25.532
Well, either way it'll
be a swell fight.

52:25.571 --> 52:29.307
And, uh, thanks to the radio
corporation of America...

52:29.341 --> 52:31.013
What do you want?

52:31.037 --> 52:32.982
I just want to tell
you something.

52:33.158 --> 52:35.668
So? Tell me.

52:35.692 --> 52:38.223
It doesn't make a difference
if you're right or wrong...

52:38.257 --> 52:40.211
Carpentier saying his prayers

52:40.235 --> 52:42.210
when I start closing in...

52:42.312 --> 52:44.059
You just have to
make a decision.

52:44.093 --> 52:46.849
Either way, it'll
be a swell fight.

52:46.883 --> 52:48.603
I'm only gonna be here
for a few more hours.

52:48.816 --> 52:51.216
I gotta get back to training,
so if you want to come up to me

52:51.240 --> 52:53.484
and, uh, introduce
yourself, say hello...

52:55.344 --> 52:58.854
I'm a federal agent! United
states department of justice!

52:58.888 --> 53:01.496
Everyone remain calm and
stay where you are.

53:02.436 --> 53:04.551
It's okay, he's alive!

53:06.654 --> 53:08.399
- You all right?
- You okay?

53:08.438 --> 53:10.900
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.

53:11.086 --> 53:13.003
Stay right with us, champ.
Don't worry.

53:13.027 --> 53:15.122
It ain't anything
to worry about.

53:29.022 --> 53:31.593
- Just there is fine.
- Yes, ma'am.

53:34.715 --> 53:36.527
Thank you.

53:40.514 --> 53:42.875
Katy?

53:42.917 --> 53:44.822
Lilian?

53:53.462 --> 53:56.275
- Help you with that?
- No, thank you.

53:56.310 --> 53:58.267
Don't be daft now.

54:01.927 --> 54:03.494
How's the great Metropolis?

54:03.561 --> 54:05.164
Fine.

54:05.220 --> 54:08.089
- Humid.
- Ah, summer's fierce here, isn't it?

54:08.259 --> 54:11.289
Wouldn't wish it on a hottentot.

54:11.313 --> 54:14.302
No one much seems to mind.

54:14.422 --> 54:17.069
Always something to keep
you busy in New York,

54:17.182 --> 54:18.792
I expect.

54:18.827 --> 54:20.962
Yes.

54:20.986 --> 54:22.992
Very lively.

54:25.533 --> 54:27.475
All right then.

54:34.446 --> 54:36.204
Where are the children?

54:36.419 --> 54:38.163
The girls took them
down to the beach.

54:38.193 --> 54:40.083
That's hardly Katy's job.

54:40.116 --> 54:42.037
Ah, the boss gave
her the afternoon.

54:42.061 --> 54:43.981
Why aren't you with him?

54:44.005 --> 54:46.705
I had some business.
Missed him just.

54:46.729 --> 54:49.955
Then shouldn't you be making
an effort to find him?

54:51.930 --> 54:54.723
Where do you want the bag?

54:54.758 --> 54:57.121
The foot of the stairs.

55:02.679 --> 55:05.362
You find it odd here ever?

55:06.449 --> 55:08.860
- In this house?
- In this country.

55:08.967 --> 55:10.909
How do you mean?

55:13.141 --> 55:15.046
Everything's off...

55:15.081 --> 55:17.546
The air, the water,

55:17.581 --> 55:20.253
the people... And yourself.

55:20.277 --> 55:24.012
You're off too, bit by bit.

55:24.046 --> 55:26.900
And you think,

55:27.101 --> 55:30.017
if I vanished now,

55:30.051 --> 55:32.365
who'd care?

55:32.389 --> 55:35.551
Or even notice?

55:35.575 --> 55:38.521
Is that how you feel?

55:38.545 --> 55:41.898
Ah. Summer days, maybe.

55:43.180 --> 55:45.354
And life...

55:45.388 --> 55:47.546
Passing by.

55:51.665 --> 55:54.527
Then you should be on
the beach with Katy.

55:55.748 --> 55:58.424
I thought you wanted me after Mr.
Thompson.

56:00.356 --> 56:02.833
In either case you
needn't be here.

56:02.857 --> 56:04.566
I'll go if you tell me.

56:07.789 --> 56:10.788
- Are you mine to command?
- If you like.

56:20.063 --> 56:22.193
You can bring the bag up.

56:38.260 --> 56:40.321
On the bench.

56:50.915 --> 56:53.720
You're the cool one, missus.

56:53.754 --> 56:56.657
No, I'm not.

56:56.684 --> 56:59.747
I'm not how you see me at all.

57:11.072 --> 57:13.730
When we're done you'll leave

57:13.773 --> 57:16.815
and we'll not speak
a word about it.

57:16.928 --> 57:18.616
Ever.

57:19.816 --> 57:23.371
Well, it's all between
strangers anyway.
