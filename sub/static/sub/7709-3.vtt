Michael!

16:42.950 --> 16:44.930
Oh, for Christ's sake.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.030
I tried being rational, OK?

16:57.030 --> 16:58.310
And what happened?

16:58.310 --> 16:59.810
The employees went crazy.

16:59.810 --> 17:03.080
I got no help from corporate so
that leaves me with no options.

I'm now going to read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.930
When you hear yours read,
please raise your hand

17:07.930 --> 17:09.300

You have forfeited
that privilege.

I have tried to treat
you all as adults

Because if you do,
I want that covered.

17:35.460 --> 17:36.590
I thought your
vagina was removed

A uterus is different
from a vagina.
