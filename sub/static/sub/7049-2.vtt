00:02.419 --> 00:03.795
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.879 --> 00:04.879
Hello, Ava.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.010
You're pregnant?

00:13.597 --> 00:17.934
It's like the best news I've heard in, like...

00:19.061 --> 00:21.104
- Ever?
- That's the word I was looking for.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.857
Maybe we should, I don't know,

00:25.859 --> 00:29.487
start looking for a house or something.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.032
You know the baby's the size of a walnut
right now, don't you?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.535
You know it's gonna get bigger, too, right?

00:35.619 --> 00:38.037
Mags' bank accounts have been seized
along with her property,

00:38.122 --> 00:39.997
but there's still a sizeable amount
of money missing.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.165
How sizeable, Raylan?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.917
Well over $10.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.129
Tell you what. I'll ask around.
See if I can't get a line on that money for you.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.464
- I appreciate it.
- In exchange for an apology.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.590
I'm sorry. What?

00:49.675 --> 00:51.759
By the time I got out
to Wade Messer's house,

00:51.844 --> 00:55.263
Dickie Bennett was tuning you up like
it was his birthday and you were his piÃ±ata.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.557
- You're saying you saved my life.
- Are you saying I didn't?

00:57.641 --> 01:01.436
You think I'm gonna hand a man over
to you to be murdered like he is, what,

01:01.520 --> 01:02.979
some pig I borrowed from you?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.188
You gave me your word.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.648
I got half a mind to kick...

01:09.945 --> 01:11.362
What the hell's he doing here?

01:23.167 --> 01:26.586
And this home is one
I think you both will really enjoy.

01:26.795 --> 01:31.507
Several amenities, including convenient
shopping and some wonderful restaurants,

01:31.675 --> 01:35.720
as well as a number of top private schools.
And you'll find...

01:36.889 --> 01:40.641
Mr. Hawkins. So glad to finally meet you.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.310
I don't see why that's so funny.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.814
You know what?
Why don't we start with the backyard?

01:46.899 --> 01:47.899
Right this way.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.570
I swear to God, I didn't know they were
here until I heard them downstairs.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.156
And yet you managed
to get all your clothes on.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.033
Hey, the only reason we're here is
'cause of you.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.159
I guess.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.787
You guess? No. No guess.
That's why we're here.

02:00.996 --> 02:04.207
Well, least I don't have to worry about
you taking up with the realtor.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.416
Why's that?

02:05.501 --> 02:06.709
'Cause she's too old for you.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.377
That guy was cute, though.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.878
I think he's married.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.464
So was I.

02:12.382 --> 02:16.928
Too short for me, though. I need someone
tall and strapping, like a... Like...

02:17.095 --> 02:19.472
- Like a...
- Like a fireman.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.724
Like a lion tamer.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.144
Outdoorsy. Good with animals.

02:25.229 --> 02:29.607
Can find alternative uses
for household furniture.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.195
No, as far as realtors go, I'm done.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.948
Person spends enough time lying
for a living,

02:37.032 --> 02:38.157
gets to the point where you realize

02:38.242 --> 02:41.369
the only thing he doesn't mean
is what he's actually saying.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.497
I'm sorry. Say that again?

03:06.144 --> 03:07.562
Crowder!

03:10.482 --> 03:11.941
You got a visitor.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.279
Let's go!

03:28.667 --> 03:34.463
Well, hello, Raylan. There you are.
Hello, Raylan. This is a surprise.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.842
Did you know my mama's Uncle Everett?

03:38.302 --> 03:40.636
Owned that squat, irritable boar.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.598
Charge you 12 bucks
to breed your sow with it.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.182
That sounds vaguely familiar.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.853
He thought he was gonna be a prizefighter
till Tommy Hearns detached both his retinas.

03:48.937 --> 03:49.979
You don't say.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.733
He once told me
that he wouldn't have relations

03:53.817 --> 03:56.027
in the three weeks prior to any fight.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.945
To keep his legs fresh?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.488
Because of his head.

04:00.115 --> 04:04.911
He said women were put here
on Earth to turn men's head to mush.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.871
Raylan, what are we talking about?

04:07.247 --> 04:13.210
What do you make of a man who divorces
a woman, then gets her pregnant,

04:13.337 --> 04:16.172
then wonders if maybe
they should move in together?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.382
Well, now, Raylan, you're talking to a man

04:19.468 --> 04:22.178
who's sleeping with his dead
brother's widow and murderess,

04:22.429 --> 04:25.097
so if you're looking for someone
to cast stones at you on this matter,

04:25.182 --> 04:27.475
I think you've picked the wrong sinner.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.102
I have not been myself, Boyd.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.149
I couldn't see that you weren't
assaulting a federal officer.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.153
You were just having a dustup
with an old buddy. And, hey,

04:39.237 --> 04:41.989
it takes two to make an accident. I know that.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.743
So, I talked to AUSA.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.204
I told them I want to amend my statement.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.040
And hopefully we'll have you out of here
by the end of the day.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.084
- I'm sorry...
- It might not be till tomorrow morning

04:53.168 --> 04:56.003
'cause the warden likes to do
his releases after wake-up.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.883
But I just hope you'll understand.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.970
Raylan...

05:08.058 --> 05:09.058
I'm done.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.978
Lot of action down here lately, if you
believe what you read in the papers.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.106
Nah, it's mostly local stuff, you know,
up in the hills.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.733
I don't think it'd bother your people
too much.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.904
Boy, I got one boy, though,
keeps finding himself in the middle of it.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.739
Finding himself or putting himself?

05:25.200 --> 05:29.578
Yeah, I think he might be my penance
for all the shit I put my first chief through.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.205
Probably.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.249
First few years I had my star,

05:33.333 --> 05:37.837
I kept waiting for my chance to walk in
the saloon through the swinging doors,

05:37.921 --> 05:40.089
hear my spurs scrape on that wood floor.

05:40.298 --> 05:44.385
Piano player stops playing.
Everybody's head turns and looks at you.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.429
"Who is that tall stranger with the badge?"

05:47.180 --> 05:50.641
You know, I used to wonder
how I'd match up with those old-timers.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.271
You know, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson,
Bass Reeves.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.148
One of my all-time favorites.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.317
And good luck trying to find a movie
about him.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.279
Somebody needs to tell Denzel that story.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.239
Bill, I got to get back to work.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.200
Yep. I can take a hint. I got rounds to make.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.744
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.537
You stop by next time you're through.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.623
I'll do it. Who else is gonna keep me
apprised of the local mischief?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.167
That's right.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.131
- Dewey, you stand away from me.
- Boyd, listen.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.593
Dewey, I know Dickie Bennett's
your new road dog,

06:25.802 --> 06:28.304
but this business ain't got
nothing to do with you.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.349
Now, when I spot him, I'm gonna go for him.
You best not be in between.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.643
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's not here.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.937
A couple screws just came,
took him to isolation.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.940
I guess they must have been tossing cells
while we were at rec time

06:40.150 --> 06:42.234
and found some contraband
under his mattress.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.153
I wonder how many days he'll get.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.823
- What?
- Raylan.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.660
- Raylan Givens? What's he got to do...
- Any chance you been here long enough

06:51.745 --> 06:54.080
to know which one
of these hacks is approachable?

06:54.206 --> 06:57.124
The kind of guy that will smuggle in
a cell phone for you for the right price?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.376
What do you need a phone for?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.253
I don't.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.257
- "The wind tickled Calliope's whiskers."
- You skipped a part.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.844
Well, how do you know? You can't even read.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.013
Did you skip a part or not?

07:11.681 --> 07:12.848
Well, you seem to think so.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.974
I know so.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.519
Baby's down. Finally.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.522
Your turn, June Bug.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.399
Mommy, I don't need to take a nap.
Naps are for babies.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.778
Naps are for Mommy
so she doesn't lose her mind.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.782
Now say goodbye to Uncle Bill.
He's gonna be gone before you get up.

07:30.992 --> 07:31.992
Bye-bye.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.787
All right. Come on.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.375
Thank you, ma'am.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.627
No contact with your family?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.254
'Course not.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.632
Not even a quick call to your mama on
her birthday?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.175
Not even.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.553
Nobody from your old life?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.972
I am following the guidelines.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.975
What about June?
Is she following the guidelines, too?

07:56.059 --> 07:58.144
Probably not.

07:58.270 --> 08:02.314
Good news is she tells her teacher one day
that she used to live in New Mexico,

08:02.399 --> 08:05.317
and the next day, she used
to be the princess of Fairyland.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.529
I can't imagine anybody takes her word
as gospel.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.909
Gets easier.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.082
Once you testify,
that's not hanging over you.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.917
This will always be hanging over me.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.796
You think Carlos Salazar is one
to forgive and forget?

08:26.089 --> 08:30.217
The entire 40-year history
of the WitSec program,

08:30.302 --> 08:31.760
however many thousand witnesses,

08:32.095 --> 08:34.554
we never lost a one
who followed the guidelines.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.185
Jesus, Bill, you scared the hell out of me.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.729
You better have one hell of a story to tell me.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.440
I do. I do. You ain't gonna believe this.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.151
I got to show you something.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.872
Stay there! Stay there! Get your hands
off it, Bill. I'll shoot you in the head.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.791
Get your hands off it!

10:25.875 --> 10:28.502
Where's your piece?
Get your friggin' leg down.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.213
Get out of here!

10:32.382 --> 10:34.383
Sorry, Bill, but you know how it is.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.179
Deputy Brooks.
My office called to tell you to expect me.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.847
- Yeah. Yeah. But...
- Hug me.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.724
In case anyone's watching.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.728
I'm your college roommate,
and I'm visiting from Dallas.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.358
- Let's go.
- Okay.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.984
I think we might be in trouble.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.528
I still... I feel like I still have some
of that jelly on my stomach.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.614
- No, I mean, just from this angle...
- Wish somebody would get me a wet wipe.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.533
...It bears a striking resemblance to
the creature from Alien.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.077
It's six weeks old, Raylan.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.954
Fine. Don't come running to me when
it busts out your ribcage.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.790
I'm so glad you're having fun with all this.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.752
Mostly I'm just scared.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.671
That's just what every little girl
dreams Prince Charming will say.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.302
I'm scared, too. FYI.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.725
Do you remember the other day,
I said something

12:06.810 --> 12:09.478
about me and you starting to
look for a house?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.564
- Think we should start looking for a house?
- That what you want?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.526
Why wouldn't I?

12:15.652 --> 12:19.655
I mean, have you given it any thought,
what you want to do after your place sells?

12:21.324 --> 12:22.449
Some.

12:25.829 --> 12:26.912
- Shit.
- What?

12:27.038 --> 12:29.790
I forgot to turn my phone back on.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.001
- Seventeen missed calls. That's bad.
- I gotta go.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.928
- How come your phone's off?
- I...

12:43.012 --> 12:45.013
Deputy Givens, Assistant Director Goodall.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.598
Hello, Raylan.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.559
Goodall?

12:48.685 --> 12:51.228
And here I thought you'd be more
surprised by the "assistant director."

12:52.856 --> 12:54.356
What are you doing here?

12:54.691 --> 12:59.903
Marshal Bill Nichols. His car was found
parked outside the diner at Castlewood.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.866
Body was dumped near a pasture
at Khartoum Farms

13:04.159 --> 13:06.034
probably sometime around midnight.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.245
Said the stink was spooking the horses.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.790
Body was mostly bled out.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.626
Three shots, leg and head.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.212
Leg shots were sufficiently clotted

13:17.297 --> 13:21.633
that the ME says that it was probably made
several hours before the kill shot.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.969
- I don't like where that leads.
- No. Me, neither.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.054
Till we know different,
we have to assume he was tortured

13:26.139 --> 13:28.307
into giving up the location
of one of his people.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.892
How many people did he have?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.393
Three in the eastern district.

13:31.603 --> 13:37.024
Mary Archer, Darrell Simmonds,
and Terry Powe,

13:37.817 --> 13:41.403
but he was responsible for all the WitSec
clients in the state and Ohio, too.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.490
- We moving them?
- No, we're just sitting on them right now.

13:44.699 --> 13:47.201
Rachel's with Mary and her two kids
in Castlewood.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.870
Tim's down in Versailles with Simmonds,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.331
and Powe's with the LPD
until I can get there.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.083
And you're just gonna keep me here when
we're "all hands on deck"?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.794
No, you're coming with me
to see Little Joe Delahunt.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.963
Remember him from your
O.C. Task Force days?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.215
We're going to Boston?

14:01.299 --> 14:04.301
Little Joe's in Lexington.
Has been for the last three days.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.095
- So?
- So, before he went into WitSec,

14:07.263 --> 14:10.015
Terry Powe was a button man
named Walter Vondas.

14:10.141 --> 14:13.519
Put Big Joe Delahunt in Leavenworth
for life times 14.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.272
Who's driving?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.149
He got guys with him?

14:19.234 --> 14:20.442
We should assume so.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.529
Be nice not to have
to kick the door down blind.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.657
I could just knock, and whoever answers,
I pull him out by the hair.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.368
Little Joe answers, you could.
He's pretty little.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.828
Little guys are always the worst.
They're more physical.

14:31.913 --> 14:35.499
How about you knock,
no matter who answers, you say,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.709
"Oh, geez. I'm sorry.
I have the wrong room"?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.420
- "Oh, geez. I'm sorry"?
- "I have the wrong room."

14:40.505 --> 14:42.214
You're different than I remember.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.840
Yeah, well, I'm older.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.552
No. It's something else.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.472
When did you get married?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.559
Few months before I got divorced.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.604
Anyway, I think it's a good plan.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.523
Unless he doesn't follow.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.568
Nothing I can think of that would keep
a guy from coming after you.

15:27.969 --> 15:31.096
Mr. Powe, Chief Deputy Art Mullen.
You should be expecting me.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.807
- What did you guys screw up this time?
- Excuse me?

15:34.225 --> 15:36.393
The guy on the phone said you were
coming by, but he didn't say why.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.270
Mr. Powe, could we do this inside

15:38.354 --> 15:40.063
in case your neighbors are looking
out the window, please?

15:40.148 --> 15:41.565
Yeah, yeah.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.866
He said you were coming by.
He didn't say why,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.702
but I've been through enough of these
scrambles to know it must be a screw-up...

15:53.786 --> 15:56.413
Mr. Powe, I'm gonna have to ask you to
step away from the window, please.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.581
Yeah. All right.

16:02.587 --> 16:06.214
You know, most of the places I've been,
lawmen always travel in packs.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.635
Roxbury detectives came to get me once.
They sent nine of them.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.389
Nine of them in two cars. They were...
They were packed in there like circus clowns.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.310
But you WitSec boys are the only ones
I've ever known to travel solo.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.479
- I'm not with WitSec.
- Oh, no?

16:20.563 --> 16:23.982
Mr. Powe, I'm going to ask you again to
step away from the window.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.194
And I'm gonna ask you again
what this is all about.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.862
Got to be some kind of threat.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.115
Otherwise, why you telling me
to get away from the window?

16:33.034 --> 16:34.993
But if that's the case,
why don't you just move me?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.457
You ain't moving me 'cause you ain't
certain the threat's for me, right?

16:41.167 --> 16:44.252
But then if that's the case...

16:45.254 --> 16:47.506
Holy shit.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.883
Did something happen to Nichols?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.013
That's it, right?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.766
That's why I couldn't get him
on the phone this morning.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.103
What is he, missing or dead?

17:03.773 --> 17:05.482
So, what, do you collect reptiles?

17:07.734 --> 17:10.112
Yeah. I collect all kinds of reptiles.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.448
Got 15 of them. The broads love them.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.784
What do you do with them? You pet them?

17:15.867 --> 17:18.578
Pet them? You can't pet them.
I don't pet them. I don't walk them.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.664
I just throw food in there,
and I leave them alone. I just...

17:20.748 --> 17:23.458
Never understood
that whole pet-reptile thing.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.836
Might be better for you
to pack a bag, Mr. Powe,

17:25.920 --> 17:27.295
in case we do have to move you.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.632
Yeah, all right.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.762
What do you feed them? Mice?

17:37.140 --> 17:38.682
I'll tell you the truth.
I don't know what to feed them.

17:38.766 --> 17:42.060
Everything I put in there, they don't eat.
They just die.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.854
I end up feeding them to the snake.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.524
You know, it's a real shame about Nichols.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.318
I always liked him. He was very decent to me.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.988
Always treated me with respect.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.575
You know, I'll tell you, Chief y,
you catch up with this guy,

17:56.659 --> 17:59.286
you ought to give me a call
before you bring him in, you know?

17:59.370 --> 18:01.955
- Nichols deserves some payback.
- Mr. Powe...

18:02.081 --> 18:04.708
Hey, hey, you know what?
Call me Walt, all right?

18:05.460 --> 18:07.169
What happened to "Terry"?

18:07.253 --> 18:09.045
Who's gonna overhear?

18:10.381 --> 18:14.718
Mr. Powe, I hope you're not informing
a sworn officer of the law

18:14.802 --> 18:16.845
of your intention to commit a major felony.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.097
Nah. I mean, look, call it a joke if you want,
you know?

18:19.182 --> 18:22.809
All I'm saying is that whoever did this
to Nichols needs to pay for it.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.269
That's all.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.093
You boys mind if I work in a set?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.853
Let's get this sleeve off.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.983
Well, I think I might need a spot.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.320
Here you go, fool.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.799
Oh, my goodness.
I must have the wrong room.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.885
Oh, no. You're wrong, honey.
This is definitely where you belong.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.012
Let go of my arm, or I'll call the manager.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.890
Hey, now, honey.
I apologize if we got off the wrong foot.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.100
Why don't you come inside?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.561
We'll grab a couple
of those travel bottles in the minibar,

19:47.645 --> 19:49.813
see if I can't put a smile on that pretty face.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.481
Butchie, what the hell's going on, huh?

19:51.566 --> 19:54.484
- And who is this guy?
- Where the hell is the goddamn ice machine?

19:54.569 --> 19:55.610
I'll show you where it is.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.575
US Marshal. Who else is inside?

20:01.659 --> 20:02.701
You just broke my damn hand!

20:02.785 --> 20:05.412
At least you put a smile on my face.
Who else is inside?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.123
You stay right there.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.002
I'm starting to doubt your plan.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.295
He came after you, didn't he?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.588
Be a doll and get me my purse.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.173
Hell. US Marshals! Open the door!

20:17.258 --> 20:19.134
Raylan? Raylan Givens?

20:19.552 --> 20:20.969
Open the door, Joe.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.596
Who's the girl?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.765
- Assistant Director...
- Goodall.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.184
- ...Goodall.
- Yeah, what's she want?

20:28.477 --> 20:31.813
Right now what I want is for you
to open the door.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.441
I guess if you had a warrant,
you'd have said so already.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.818
What kind of half-assed assistant director
doesn't have the juice

20:36.903 --> 20:38.069
to get herself a warrant?

20:38.154 --> 20:40.280
You know, you're right.
I don't have a warrant.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.948
You want to talk about juice, though?

20:42.325 --> 20:44.576
I have the juice
to get your daddy put in solitary,

20:44.660 --> 20:46.328
fed all his meals through a slot in the door.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.205
I have the juice to kick open this door
and make you put your hand in there

20:49.290 --> 20:50.582
while I kick it closed again,

20:50.666 --> 20:53.043
and I'm gonna do that over and over again
until you tell me

20:53.294 --> 20:55.879
which one of your guys murdered
a Deputy Marshal.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.798
And if you still don't,
then I'm gonna get mean.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.346
Whichever of my guys did what?

21:06.474 --> 21:07.974
What's going on, Raylan?

21:09.185 --> 21:10.185
You're sure?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.521
Yeah. No, I'll take care of it.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.316
Everything all right?

21:16.400 --> 21:19.194
Actually, no. Little Joe's here in Kentucky.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.529
We think some of his guys
might be on the way over here.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.407
- What does that mean?
- That means we have to get out of here,

21:24.492 --> 21:26.076
so get your bag.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.961
So, I really got to stay down here
the whole time?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.004
Yeah. Sorry. Protocol.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.968
Same protocol that says you got
to take my car?

21:43.052 --> 21:44.844
If your vehicle had been compromised,

21:44.929 --> 21:48.181
if they had installed a tracking device
on it or something,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.141
they would have already been
at your address,

21:50.226 --> 21:53.019
which would mean they wouldn't need
to track your car.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.729
Makes sense.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.901
Look, this is probably not the thing you want
to hear from the guy

21:59.986 --> 22:01.611
that's supposed to be protecting your life,

22:01.696 --> 22:03.947
but I really have no idea
where that safe house is.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.991
Do you mind if I use your navigation system?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.409
Knock yourself out.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.122
Hey, you think they're gonna
relocate me again?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.500
Tell you, if they do, this time,
I got to spend more time picking my name.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.379
That "Terry" was like a joke.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.173
You know, like that movie
with the guy and his wife.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.342
They get their WitSec names,
and the wife says, "Terry,"

22:24.427 --> 22:28.138
and the Marshal or whatever, he says,
"No, no. That's your name."

22:32.059 --> 22:34.185
Tell you, I can use a new gig, too.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.230
You think they would let me work
in a bar or something?

22:37.606 --> 22:39.607
You know what?
We're not as far away as I thought.

22:42.778 --> 22:43.945
You kidding me? Already?

22:46.824 --> 22:47.824
What the...

22:56.292 --> 22:59.127
- Get out, you son of a bitch.
- All right. All right.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.383
Mr. Crowder, federal law requires me

23:05.468 --> 23:08.094
to give you the option
to refuse all medical treatment

23:08.262 --> 23:11.723
and to also tell you that by doing so
may result in disciplinary action.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.435
Do I have your consent to proceed?

23:15.686 --> 23:16.686
You do.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.563
All right. Let's see here.

23:22.610 --> 23:23.943
Open five.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.226
Ask my permission to use my car.
Ask my permission to use the nav.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.395
Real careful. Make sure you're doing
everything by the book.

23:59.480 --> 24:03.024
Then we get here, you start searching
my friggin' house without a warrant?

24:03.609 --> 24:06.236
Well, we were using the new book then.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.698
Now we're using the old book.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.620
That's my savings. I don't trust the banks.

24:17.832 --> 24:22.544
Walter, all that permission I was asking
was before I got into your nav system

24:22.628 --> 24:26.881
and figured out exactly where your car was
at the moment Bill Nichols was killed.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.468
Now, we don't have a lot of time here.

24:30.553 --> 24:35.431
You got one chance, exactly one,
to tell me what you did.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.061
All right.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.022
We'll stick to the Old Testament, then.

24:43.107 --> 24:47.527
You know, back in the old days, we used
to use the phone book. You know, whack!

24:48.237 --> 24:51.197
But people don't even
have phone books anymore.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.409
We still used to tell people,

24:54.493 --> 24:57.787
"You have the right to remain silent as
long as you can stand the pain."

24:59.832 --> 25:01.457
Son of a bitch!

25:06.046 --> 25:07.755
That phone call I got

25:08.716 --> 25:11.092
was from my guy who I sent
to brace Little Joe.

25:11.886 --> 25:15.638
And the kid gave you up,
said that you called him a few days ago,

25:15.723 --> 25:18.558
and you asked him how much it would cost
for you to buy back into the game,

25:18.642 --> 25:21.144
square everything
for sending the old man to jail.

25:22.062 --> 25:25.273
He told you $2 million,
thinking that you'd never come up with it,

25:26.150 --> 25:29.444
and then you told him to come on down here
to Kentucky.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.070
Now, the way I figure it,

25:31.155 --> 25:35.533
the only way you come up with that kind
of money is by trailing your WitSec Marshal,

25:35.784 --> 25:38.077
finding out where all his other clients are,

25:38.162 --> 25:41.915
and then selling out at least one of them
to whoever's looking for him.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.627
So, what happened?

25:45.711 --> 25:48.087
Nichols figured out you were trailing him.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.257
Yeah, let me guess.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.218
You never planned on killing him.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.054
- It just kind of happened.
- Yeah.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.688
I know what you mean.
I didn't really plan any of this.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.565
Just kind of happened.

26:08.317 --> 26:12.528
So, the only people you intended to hurt
were your fellow protectees,

26:12.988 --> 26:14.989
people in the exact same position as you,

26:15.574 --> 26:18.243
living scared every day of their lives.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.204
Except that maybe some of them were
in the Witness Protection Program

26:21.288 --> 26:23.665
'cause they wanted to do the right thing

26:23.749 --> 26:27.126
and not because they were a sniveling,
murdering, piece of shit like you,

26:27.211 --> 26:29.128
who just wanted to stay out of jail.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.344
That the gun you killed Nichols with?

26:38.097 --> 26:40.181
- You need to talk to me, Walter!
- Hey!

26:58.033 --> 27:00.159
All right. This is what's gonna happen.

27:00.411 --> 27:04.330
You're gonna tell me who you sold out
and who you sold them out to.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.292
Otherwise, I'm gonna take your gun.

27:07.376 --> 27:11.796
I'm gonna fire a couple bullets into that wall
over there, and then I'm gonna take my gun.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.340
I'm gonna fire a couple bullets into your face.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.718
Then, when the cavalry gets here,
I'll just tell them

27:16.802 --> 27:20.179
that you drew down on me,
and I did what I had to do.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.890
I don't think anybody will shed
too many tears.

27:24.018 --> 27:26.394
Hey! Hey!

27:32.651 --> 27:34.902
Deputy Brooks, I was about
to make some tea. You want some?

27:34.987 --> 27:37.322
- Thanks. That would be wonderful.
- Okay.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.368
Hey, Art.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.292
They're already here.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.434
- Art?
- Yeah.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.064
He followed Nichols, sold out Mary Archer.
We got to go.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.942
Let's go!

28:49.144 --> 28:50.520
Oh, my God.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.503
Rachel, talk to me.

29:58.881 --> 29:59.922
We're good, Art.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.891
Hey, hey. Come... Come on.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.394
Ain't you supposed to call out
the cell number when you're opening up?

30:13.479 --> 30:14.479
Hello, Dick.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.647
Help!

30:26.742 --> 30:29.243
There ain't nobody
gonna save you now, Dick.

30:29.912 --> 30:33.331
Are you ready for what it's gonna feel like
when I open you up?

30:33.415 --> 30:35.708
That blood pouring out of you.

30:35.792 --> 30:39.754
The air whistling through that little hole
I'm about to make in your neck.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.344
I'm gonna take my hand off your mouth.

30:46.595 --> 30:51.891
But if I even think for one second you
gonna scream, trust me, you gonna scream.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.687
Ready? On three. One, two.

31:00.943 --> 31:05.446
Boyd, you know...
You know I never meant to hurt...

31:05.614 --> 31:09.325
Hey, hey. Don't even say her name.
You understand me?

31:10.077 --> 31:13.538
Making up lies about how you shot Ava by
mistake ain't gonna be your salvation today.

31:13.622 --> 31:14.622
But, Boyd...

31:14.706 --> 31:17.708
The only thing that's gonna save you
right now is the truth.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.378
The truth?
Okay, what kind of truth do you want?

31:20.462 --> 31:22.296
- Well, I'm glad that you asked.
- Okay.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.465
The truth about your mama's money.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.925
Mama's money?

31:26.009 --> 31:31.138
But you, you know better than anyone
that all that money, the Black Pike money...

31:31.306 --> 31:33.224
- Oh, Dick, Dick.
- It went right into trust for Doyle's boys.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.309
That ain't the money I'm talking about.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.979
I'm talking about everything she squirreled
away over all them years.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.815
You're gonna tell me how
to get my hands on it.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.364
I can't.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.409
Boyd, wait, wait.

31:51.493 --> 31:55.371
You don't understand.
I'm just saying that I can't tell you

31:55.455 --> 31:59.625
how to get your hands on it because
I'm the only one he will give it to.

31:59.710 --> 32:05.089
I'm the only one. Even if I told him,
"Hey, give it to him. Boyd is my friend,"

32:05.173 --> 32:10.678
or whatever, he will never,
ever give it to someone else.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.390
- Who is he?
- Have you heard of Ellstin Limehouse?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.267
- Yeah, I heard of him.
- Nobles Hollow. Okay.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.103
He owed Mama some kind of debt, okay?

32:19.187 --> 32:22.690
And that's why she knew
that he was gonna keep her money safe.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.942
And now, listen, Boyd. Hey, hey.

32:25.027 --> 32:29.780
I'm just telling you that money dies
right here with me, okay?

32:30.699 --> 32:31.699
I'm just...

32:40.208 --> 32:41.292
What time is your flight?

32:41.376 --> 32:42.918
Any time I want.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.795
They flew me down on the service jet.

32:44.880 --> 32:45.880
Look at you.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.549
Want to go to Miami?

32:53.305 --> 32:56.974
They just let you use the jet like that?
Like you're some kind of rock star?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.268
I take it to Paris every weekend.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.730
You know, I transported a prisoner
from Paris once.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.482
They had some really good coffee.

33:05.025 --> 33:09.362
But it was so little, I didn't know if I could
hang out or if I was supposed to leave.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.113
Felt a little uncomfortable.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.409
I miss Miami, Raylan.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.954
- I miss Dan.
- Yeah?

33:19.456 --> 33:21.749
He was the best chief I ever had.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.250
Art seems good.

33:24.586 --> 33:25.670
Yeah.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.131
Art saved my life.

33:30.801 --> 33:31.884
How?

33:33.428 --> 33:35.930
Ever tell you I'm from Harlan County?

33:37.599 --> 33:38.641
No.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.771
You got nothing to worry about.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.028
How you feeling?

33:51.113 --> 33:53.823
I'm fine. It's not like he's my first.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.785
No. He's your first since your first.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.955
You sound like that psychologist I had
to speak to the last time.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.373
What did you tell him?

34:02.457 --> 34:05.960
I told her what I felt was a tremendous relief.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.601
I just heard.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.647
I'm so sorry.
I just want to make sure you're okay.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.576
Thank you.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.580
Should I stay? Or meet me at home, or...

34:42.664 --> 34:45.123
- No, if you don't mind, stay.
- I'll stay.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.333
You want to sit?

34:48.795 --> 34:50.713
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm okay.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.174
- Just give me a minute. I'll be one sec.
- All right.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.177
Yeah, I'll call you back.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.514
Hey, did you ever hear
from Arnett's assistant?

35:02.142 --> 35:03.142
- Yvette?
- Yeah.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.853
- You ever heard from her since that night?
- No. Why?

35:05.979 --> 35:07.438
That was FPD.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.232
They said all the carpet had been pulled out
of Arnett's office

35:10.317 --> 35:12.777
and the concrete underneath
had been bleached.

35:12.903 --> 35:13.944
That's never good.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.947
Might be worth a trip
down there tomorrow morning.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.038
Are you okay?

35:24.623 --> 35:27.249
Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

35:35.425 --> 35:37.718
Hey. We good?

35:38.720 --> 35:40.513
You file your report?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.724
Then, yeah, you're sprung.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.812
It's good to see you.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.232
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.553
Baby. What happened to your face?

36:20.637 --> 36:23.806
The apple of my eye, the rose of my Sharon.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.433
Is it possible
that you could be more beautiful?

36:30.397 --> 36:32.022
Will you tell me what happened to your face?

36:32.107 --> 36:34.191
I didn't play well with others.

36:34.734 --> 36:37.152
It was a little harder to get to Dickie
than I thought.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.488
- But you did get to him?
- I did.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.576
And he told you
where his mama kept her money?

36:43.827 --> 36:45.035
He did.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.871
Fact you're not dancing me
around this parking lot

36:46.955 --> 36:48.831
makes me think there's a "but" coming.

36:48.999 --> 36:52.626
But getting at it's gonna take some doing.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.753
Why? Where is it?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.630
It's with Limehouse.

37:16.651 --> 37:21.947
Bernard, you know the Army used
to hang men who fell asleep on watch?

37:23.325 --> 37:25.034
Yes, sir, Mr. Limehouse.

37:25.452 --> 37:28.162
Yeah, these dangerous times for us,

37:28.371 --> 37:32.499
with the law sniffing around us,
that Crowder boy fresh out of jail.

37:41.468 --> 37:45.095
Now more than ever, we need to stay vigilant,

37:45.180 --> 37:47.848
starting with the man on night watch

37:47.933 --> 37:51.101
over the one bridge we got going in and out
of our holler.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.895
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Yes, sir.

37:55.649 --> 37:59.693
Bernard, did you ever hear me argue with
your dad about the best way to train a dog?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.528
There was a time I thought

38:02.864 --> 38:08.994
that pain was the only thing
a dog remembers.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.457
But it was your daddy who taught me

38:14.334 --> 38:18.837
a dog also remembers
when you elect not to hurt him.

38:20.173 --> 38:24.093
And if you can get your dog
to not just remember,

38:24.177 --> 38:28.389
but to learn from the not hurting,
then he's yours for life.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.975
But some dogs, though,

38:33.061 --> 38:37.982
they take you not giving them the hurt
that they deserve as weakness.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.402
And after that first pass, well,
they can't never be taught.

38:42.112 --> 38:44.530
You got no choice but to put that dog down.

38:50.996 --> 38:56.250
You ever see what happens when you put
too much lye in the scalding water?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.254
Well, it burns off the hair

39:02.132 --> 39:03.882
and the hog's skin besides.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.223
Now, I'm gonna give you a choice, Bernard.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.062
I can pour some of this here
on the back of your hand,

39:18.690 --> 39:22.192
see, turn the heat on
the pressure hose up near boiling,

39:23.069 --> 39:25.154
and then we'll take this hand,

39:27.073 --> 39:30.534
and we stick it in
under the stream till I decide we square.

39:31.661 --> 39:35.289
Then we take your hand out,
pour on some vinegar,

39:36.041 --> 39:38.417
and hope that lye hasn't eaten down
to the bone.

39:39.878 --> 39:43.088
Or you promise me

39:43.590 --> 39:46.050
that you will never fail me
again in any capacity,

39:46.134 --> 39:48.510
and we can all go on back about our evening.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.971
Now, before you choose,

39:52.307 --> 39:53.849
I'm gonna tell you what.

39:53.933 --> 40:00.314
That first way hurt like nothing
that you ain't ever felt, but it'll square us.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.941
Second way doesn't hurt,

40:03.026 --> 40:07.821
but it will mean next time you screw up,

40:09.115 --> 40:13.660
I'll have to take that as a sign
that you don't respect me anymore.

40:16.247 --> 40:20.751
Now, can I assume from your face
that you're choosing door number two?
