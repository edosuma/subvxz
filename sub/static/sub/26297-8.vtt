00:02.089 --> 00:05.222
ADULT ADAM: The '80s gave us countless fad diets and fitness crazes.

00:05.309 --> 00:08.965
FromBody By Jake
toBuns of Steel,
my mom did 'em all.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.794
My dad, not so much.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.231
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Emory.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.363
We need to have
a little pow-wow...

00:15.450 --> 00:17.321
Oh, crap,
here we go.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.062
He got the results
of your blood work back,

00:19.149 --> 00:21.978
and your triglycerides
are over 500!

00:22.065 --> 00:24.198
Wow! That's amazing!
Way to go, Dad!

00:24.285 --> 00:26.417
No, it's a bad thing.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.811
Oh, no!
You're blowing it, Dad!

00:28.898 --> 00:31.770
You and I are going on
a serious health kick,
starting now.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.599
It's called
Sweatin' to the Oldies,

00:34.686 --> 00:36.514
and that is Richard Simmons.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.690
He plays Motown hits,
and you and I

00:38.777 --> 00:41.606
will sweat together
as a couple! Fun!

00:41.693 --> 00:44.435
Getting schvitzy
to old

00:44.522 --> 00:46.002
That does sound fun!

00:46.089 --> 00:47.395
Bevy, go grab
my walking sneakers

00:47.482 --> 00:48.744
out of the back
of the closet.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.006
What's going on?

00:50.093 --> 00:52.139
Why is Dad standing
as if to participate?

00:52.226 --> 00:54.054
Because your mother
is right.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.794
Today begins
a new me.

00:55.881 --> 00:59.015
Time for Richard Simmons
to take us down
to Funky Fitness Town!

00:59.102 --> 01:02.714
For my beautiful angel,
anything.

01:02.801 --> 01:06.544
Since when do you
walk or wear sneakers
or participate in life?

01:06.631 --> 01:08.720
Here's the deal. Every year
after I see the doctor,

01:08.807 --> 01:12.159
your mom forces me to do
some stupid new exercise fad.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.638
Since when?
I've never seen that.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.770
Exactly!

01:14.857 --> 01:16.815
Right before
we start working out,

01:16.902 --> 01:19.818
I bombard your mom
with a year's worth
of compliments.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.907
So you don't compliment
the lady all year long?

01:21.994 --> 01:24.171
No, I save it all
for this very moment.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.086
And it gets her
all flustered and distracted,

01:26.173 --> 01:27.652
and that's when
I ask her out

01:27.739 --> 01:30.264
for a big, fancy
lobster dinner.Why?

01:30.351 --> 01:32.701
Your mom forgets
all about exercising,

01:32.788 --> 01:35.486
and I get to dump ocean meat
into hot butter.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.620
But they list lobster
as market price on the menu.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.491
You say they're vague
on purpose to rip you off.

01:40.578 --> 01:43.277
Oh, it's so worth it, man.
I don't want to exercise.

01:43.364 --> 01:46.497
Okay, there's no way
any of this actually works
in the real world.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.109
Time to shake it,
Mustang Murray!

01:49.196 --> 01:50.936
ADULT ADAM: And so my dad
put his plan into action.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.547
Go easy on me,

01:52.634 --> 01:54.418
because I'm not
in perfect shape
like you are.

01:54.505 --> 01:55.724
Me?

01:55.811 --> 01:57.987
Oh, stop it.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.337
Maybe it's just
your beautiful new haircut?

02:00.424 --> 02:02.034
I didn't think
you noticed.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.427
How could I not?

02:03.514 --> 02:05.560
It looks like
you're wearing a golden crown,

02:05.647 --> 02:07.301
which makes sense
because you're my queen.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.303
And you are
my big, grumbly king.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.132
How about we head downtown
to Bookbinders

02:12.219 --> 02:14.177
for a delicious
lobster dinner?

02:14.264 --> 02:15.787
Well, I better
get outta this spandex

02:15.874 --> 02:18.747
and put on
my sparkliest sweater.

02:18.834 --> 02:22.229
And that is how
you never move your body.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.708
You're not a very good
life partner.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.622

ADULT ADAM:
It was November 28th,
1980-something.

02:41.813 --> 02:44.642
and I was in a real quandary, thanks to my toy truck.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.861
Sup, nerd.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.819
My Big Trak programmable
robo-truck

02:47.906 --> 02:49.647
went rogue and rolled
into the living room.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.259
Ohh, man.
Not the living room.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.086
Yep. Our living room.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.653
It was my mom's pride and joy.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.438
She kept it
like a pristine museum,

02:57.525 --> 02:59.875
and for us, it was completely off limits.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.008
Can you
be a heroic big sis

03:03.095 --> 03:04.619
and trot in there
and grab it for me?

03:04.706 --> 03:05.794
Hell no!

03:05.881 --> 03:07.622
You know
that room is off limits

03:07.709 --> 03:09.580

when Mom wants to entertain

03:09.667 --> 03:12.409

lame-ass furniture.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.758
Ugh. And don't get me
started on...

03:13.845 --> 03:15.282
The owls.

03:17.327 --> 03:20.243
You want my advice?
I'd forget the toy truck.
It's gone. Move on.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.419
But I can see it
right there!

03:22.506 --> 03:25.901
This is crazy.
The point of a living room is
to use it for actual living.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.816
I'm going in!
You're a klutz.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.426

All I need is two seconds...

Ever since I decided

diet and exercise

05:13.791 --> 05:15.402
are important
to living a long life?

05:15.489 --> 05:16.272
Rings a bell.
Sure.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.708

Apparently, my dad's
Tetris-Cyclopses

means the world to me,

"I love you,"

do you really mean
not talking to him

05:35.030 --> 05:36.553
but he just knows?
No!

05:36.640 --> 05:38.468
I mean,
say the words.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.165
Now, when you say
"Say the words,"

05:40.252 --> 05:42.559
do you really mean
go up to him with
the intent of saying it

05:43.952 --> 05:45.388

I'm talking about
actual words
or even a hug.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.915
Now, when you say "hug,"
do you really mean
rough horseplay

05:51.002 --> 05:52.439
that ends with me getting
tackled through drywall?

05:52.526 --> 05:54.658

is I need to use

08:06.834 --> 08:09.793
Charles and I would like Chad
to take over the flower shop,

08:09.880 --> 08:13.101
but he'd rather play Nintendo
and drink his precious Pepsi.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.756
If our kids don't want
anything we value,

08:15.843 --> 08:17.975
then why are we saving it
in the first place?

08:18.062 --> 08:20.717
Well, my big game plan
is to get really old and die

08:20.804 --> 08:23.328
and then they have to take it
out of obligation.

08:23.415 --> 08:26.636
Okay, yes, we all agree
your dying would be
the best-case scenario.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.204
But that's not really
something we can explore
as an option right now.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.467
Then what do we do?

08:31.554 --> 08:35.427
If our kids aren't going to
appreciate any of this,
then we will.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.822
Starting tomorrow, I am gonna
sell everything in here
and use the money for me.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.042
No, for us.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.957
I'm gonna buy us all
a cruise to the Bahamas

08:43.044 --> 08:45.655
like that Kathie Lee Gifford
sings and dances about.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.091
Oh!
Go, Bev!

08:47.178 --> 08:48.136
Frentas forever!

08:49.441 --> 08:51.052
All right, I'm home.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.532
Nobody bother me!

08:52.619 --> 08:54.534
Wow! Look who's
fresh from work

08:54.621 --> 08:56.753
and is immediately dropping
his pants at the door.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.450
What the hell,
moron?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.148
Why is there a metal
octopus in my den?

09:00.235 --> 09:01.889
This is a Bowflex,

09:01.976 --> 09:04.587
an all-in-one
total body sculptor

09:04.674 --> 09:07.198
which has been assembled
by the greatest minds
of my generation.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.417
That's us.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.071
Really hoping this bar
isn't crucial in any way.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.421
I don't care what it is,
it's blocking my chair,

09:12.508 --> 09:13.770
and that's where
I do my best sitting.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.990
Starting now,
you only sit in this.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.775
And through the power
of science and pulling,

09:18.862 --> 09:21.473
it will transform your body
into Lorenzo Lamas.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.040
I don't know
who that is,

09:23.127 --> 09:25.869
but I hate his name
and this Moron-Flex thing.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.218
You haven't even
tried it!

09:27.305 --> 09:28.698
Watch as I
flex these bows.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.615
Ah!
You really want
a workout?

09:32.702 --> 09:34.574
Clean this up
and take it out
to the garbage.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.402
Damn it!

09:37.489 --> 09:39.535
Why won't he fall
for my ingenious traps

09:39.622 --> 09:41.319
of health
and wellness?

09:41.406 --> 09:42.886
Okay, you love your dad,
right?

09:42.973 --> 09:45.759
Just tell him how you feel
and stop with the tricks.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.804
ADULT ADAM: With that,
Barry went and did
the next logical thing.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.633
Coach accepts
your challenge.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.853
Molding your lumpy father
into hardened steel

09:52.940 --> 09:54.463
will forever
be my legacy.

09:54.550 --> 09:57.205
This is a good choice.
I made a good choice.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.860
♪♪

09:59.947 --> 10:02.427
ADULT ADAM: Now that
we rejected our mom's
prized possessions,

10:02.514 --> 10:05.213
she went to the one place
where they would fetch
top dollar.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.129
Okay, our auction begins
tomorrow at noon.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.087
You have the catalogue.
Everything is in it.

10:10.174 --> 10:13.656
I set some preliminary prices
to get the ball rolling.
Any questions?

10:13.743 --> 10:16.790
Yes, many questions,
starting with
what the ?

10:16.877 --> 10:17.878
Oh, wow.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.620
Your pricing
is embarrassingly low.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.013
Okay, well, why don't you
name some prices,

10:23.100 --> 10:24.972
and we'll come
to a happy medium.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.626
And that's exactly
what she did.

10:26.713 --> 10:30.412
You think an umbrella stand
made of pure antique brass
is $50?

10:30.499 --> 10:32.153
No. Try $2,000.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.372
This commode
is one-of-a-kind.

10:34.459 --> 10:37.201
I'll take no less
than $6,802.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.073
This Victorian-style
chandelier

10:39.160 --> 10:40.640
needs all-new
wiring and bulbs

10:40.727 --> 10:42.380
and is
$42,000 American.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.513
Chippendale-style
slant front desk.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.602
It has my son Barry's name
carved in it,

10:46.689 --> 10:49.126
which makes it
$100,000 exactly.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.607
Semi-authentic
Cherry Blossom privacy screen.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.696
I think 1.2 is fair,

10:53.783 --> 10:55.306
but I don't want to
seem unrealistic,

10:55.393 --> 10:56.699
so... 1.1.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.483
This golden
red velvet couch

10:58.570 --> 11:01.095
is the aria of
my personal furniture opera.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.880
I'll accept no less than
$6.5 million.

11:04.794 --> 11:05.926
This is priceless.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.277
The display of dead owls
is priceless?

11:09.364 --> 11:12.106
See, I bought them
on my honeymoon in London,

11:12.193 --> 11:14.021
and you can't just bring
things like this

11:14.108 --> 11:16.893
back into our country
for disease-control reasons,

11:16.980 --> 11:18.982
so when I was at customs,

11:19.069 --> 11:20.941
I pretended to be
a science teacher

11:21.028 --> 11:22.420
in need of them
for my students.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.074
That can't
possibly be true.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.033
That story is 100% real.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.122
Which is why
this item is so special,

11:28.209 --> 11:30.820
one cannot
put a monetary value on it.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.779
Let me take a stab.
60 bucks?

11:32.866 --> 11:36.347
I hear you, and I'm willing
to go down to $40,000.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.436
ERICA: "Michael Locati
Auction House presents

11:38.523 --> 11:41.788
"The Beverly Goldberg
Million

11:41.875 --> 11:43.441
Oh, my God!
Is this for real?

11:43.528 --> 11:47.358
Look, $40,000
for our ugly-ass
red garbage couch.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.578
That's my couch
I didn't want!
But now I do!

11:49.665 --> 11:51.841
No, you passed on it,
so now it's mine.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.321
And I will fight you
for it!

11:53.408 --> 11:54.539
Hey.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.498
I wasn't just
standing out here waiting,

11:56.585 --> 11:58.326
but since I am here,
I wanted to let you know

11:58.413 --> 12:00.894
that you're too late
to have my prized heirlooms.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.157
But those belong
to our family!

12:03.244 --> 12:06.377
And soon they'll belong
to wealthy European tycoons.

12:06.464 --> 12:10.381
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a Caribbean cruise
to plan with the Frentas.

12:10.468 --> 12:14.037
Those sassy cows
are living high off
our inheritance. Unreal!

12:14.124 --> 12:16.344
Well, I suppose
I do have a few baubles left.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.302
If either one of you
would like to claim them...

12:18.389 --> 12:19.739
Those baubles are mine!
I call all the baubles!

12:19.826 --> 12:21.131
Ohh!

12:21.218 --> 12:23.394
♪♪

12:26.267 --> 12:28.922
Ohh, this is
a big win for me.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.793
Gah!

12:30.880 --> 12:32.577
Mornin',
Murray Goldberg!

12:32.664 --> 12:34.188
You did the right thing
calling in Coach
from the bullpen.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.972
I didn't call anyone.
I did.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.974
Coach is here to
whip us both into shape.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.976
But mostly you.
Ho, yeah.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.065
Now, are you ready to begin
the long, painful journey

12:42.152 --> 12:43.545
to physical perfection?
What do you say?

12:43.632 --> 12:45.199
I say
get out of my house.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.766
Barry said you'd say
those exact words.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.942
But Coach never knows
when to go away,

12:49.029 --> 12:50.944
so pop off that shirt
and let me see what
I'm working with.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.423
Nobody's popping off
anything.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.860
Don't worry.
When I'm done with you,

12:53.947 --> 12:55.600
that shirt's gonna
pop itself off.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.167
Are you ready
to feel the burn?

12:57.254 --> 12:59.039
ADULT ADAM:
Of course he wasn't.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.737
And so my dad proceeded to break down Mellor just like he did with my mom.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.130
You know what, Coach?

13:03.217 --> 13:05.132
Your fiery fitness words
have me pumped up.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.003
Hot dog!
Score!

13:07.090 --> 13:09.353
Bar, go grab my
walking sneakers out
of the back of my closet.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.528
On it!

13:10.615 --> 13:12.139
Just go easy on me.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.228
Clearly, I'm not
in perfect shape like you.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.056
Oh. Well,
I wouldn't say "perfect."

13:16.143 --> 13:18.145
Elite, maybe.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.843
Are you kidding?
They ought to put up a statue
of you in the town square.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.106
Well,
I'm not a vain man,

13:23.193 --> 13:25.456
but if a statue of me
inspired the town

13:25.543 --> 13:27.502
to physical fitness,
I wouldn't object.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.461
Hey, what do you say
we stop off at the buffet

13:30.548 --> 13:34.030
at the Ritz in Center City
and map out a game

13:34.117 --> 13:35.423
That's the fanciest
breakfast in town.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.859
They put parsley
on every plate,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.034
even the ones
that don't need it.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.602
Your body's
a fine-tuned machine, Coach.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.083
You need to feed it
the best triple-stack waffles

13:43.170 --> 13:45.302
and buttermilk biscuits
in town.

13:45.389 --> 13:48.566
Well, I do allow myself
a cheat day once a decade,

13:48.653 --> 13:49.829
and that day's arrived!

13:49.916 --> 13:51.265
Go warm up the car.

13:51.352 --> 13:52.570
You got it.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.094
Today, we feast!

13:54.181 --> 13:55.965
Hello, and welcome.

13:56.052 --> 13:59.403
Today, we begin with
items from the
Beverly Goldberg Collection.

13:59.490 --> 14:04.060
First up is this unique
red sitting opportunity.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.280
And the bidding begins at...

14:06.367 --> 14:07.847
$40,000.

14:08.804 --> 14:09.805
Anyone?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.025
Anyone?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.375
Tell them
it's a family heirloom.

14:14.462 --> 14:18.292
My grandfather made a horse
carry it across Slovania.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.642
The horse was proud,
but never the same.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.036
Okay. Anyone want to
be a part

14:23.123 --> 14:25.690
of this lady's
upsetting history?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.605
Anyone?
What's happening?

14:27.692 --> 14:30.217
Why is no one getting in
on that bargain
basement price?

14:30.304 --> 14:31.871
You know,
if you really wanted
this to sell,

14:31.958 --> 14:34.743
you would let me
lower the price
to something like $200.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.877
There you go.
$200, going once.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.139
That is
highway robbery!

14:39.226 --> 14:41.010
Essie, quick!
Bid $100,000.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.664
I'm not doing that.
Why?

14:42.751 --> 14:45.319
Honestly, 'cause
that couch looks like
it belongs in a bordello.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.538
Fine. Virginia!
You always do what I say.
Bid right now.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.018
But I don't want to.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.108
This fidgety blond woman
wants to bid $100,000.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.415
I really don't!
No, she really doesn't.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.852
Anyone
Any real bids?
Anyone at all?

14:56.939 --> 14:58.680
I bid $500,000.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.768
Ignore that woman.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.683
And sold for $200!

15:01.770 --> 15:04.164
No! Unsold!

15:04.251 --> 15:05.774
Next up, we have...
Oh, Lord.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.384
I bid $10 million.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.560
I'm taking it all back.
No one touch my stuff.

15:09.647 --> 15:10.910
Happy this is over.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.912
Moving on!

15:12.999 --> 15:14.739
ADULT ADAM:
While my mom's auction
proved to be a bust,

15:14.826 --> 15:17.177
my dad was proving
that even Coach couldn't
whip him into shape.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.483
Ugh. Tummy so full.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.876
I gotta unbutton...

15:20.963 --> 15:22.530
There's the stuff.
Yeah.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.619
What the hell?
Why are you slothing around

15:24.706 --> 15:26.316
with Coach
instead of getting fit?

15:26.403 --> 15:27.970
Gimme another sleeve
of Double Stufs, Mur-Money.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.363
Dude, your dad
ruined Coach Mellor.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.886
It's been one day!
How?

15:30.973 --> 15:33.149
I know how!

15:33.236 --> 15:35.935
You fed him fancy foods
and compliments
like with Mom, didn't you?

15:36.022 --> 15:37.762
I didn't compliment
anyone, moron.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.155
Well,
you said my calves

15:39.242 --> 15:40.765
look like
recently picked coconuts.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.550
Right off the tree.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.465
You leave me
no choice, Father.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.249
It's time I express
my feelings for you

15:46.336 --> 15:48.121
in a totally real
and honest way.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.253
You can do it, Bar!
No! Don't do it, man!

15:50.340 --> 15:52.647
I'm scared,
but there's no going back.I can't watch this.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.431
Prepare to hear everything
that's in my heart.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.651
Okay, I think it's time
for ol' Coach to scoot.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.914
No, you stay!
What's happening?

15:59.001 --> 16:01.743
I want everyone to watch me
openly, directly
communicate with my dad.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.136
What?
Don't do any of that.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.485
This can't be done!
Dad...

16:04.572 --> 16:06.356
Don't say it, man.
...I care about you.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.141
Oh! He said it.
I don't know where to look.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.751
Stop using
those words at me.

16:09.838 --> 16:10.882
You mean everything to me!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.362
