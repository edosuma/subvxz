00:00.065 --> 00:02.125
Previously onThe Originals...
When the spell is over,

00:02.175 --> 00:03.525
you got to get away
from each other,

00:03.565 --> 00:05.045
and you have to stay away
from Hope.

00:05.085 --> 00:06.485
So the evil is
separated for all time.

00:06.525 --> 00:08.305
A powerful seer
prophesied destruction.

00:08.355 --> 00:09.875
"And thou shall know the signs

00:09.925 --> 00:11.615
of blood from water,
vipers from the rivers."

00:11.665 --> 00:12.875
KLAUS: "Fire across the water,

00:12.925 --> 00:14.665
"monsoons from the sea.

00:14.705 --> 00:16.105
The death of all Firstborns."

00:16.145 --> 00:17.185
Freya, me.
Hope.

00:17.235 --> 00:19.325
This is the last time
we can do this.

00:19.365 --> 00:20.935
I'm gonna fix this for us.

00:20.975 --> 00:23.155
We have to save
always and forever.

00:23.195 --> 00:25.155
I'd really like your help.
Anything you need.

00:25.195 --> 00:26.765
He let Hayley die!
She thought Elijah

00:26.805 --> 00:28.195
was there for her,
but he wasn't.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.375
[neck snaps]
[gasps]

00:30.415 --> 00:31.205
This is revenge.

00:31.245 --> 00:32.555
I'm taking great pleasure

00:32.595 --> 00:33.945
knowing she'll suffer.

00:33.985 --> 00:35.205
For a cure for Klaus's bite,
he wants to make a deal.

00:35.245 --> 00:36.815
Are you ready?
Open the red door.

00:36.865 --> 00:38.255
Remember your family.

00:38.295 --> 00:39.865
Remember Hayley!
[shouts]

00:39.905 --> 00:40.995
Why isn't he waking up?

00:41.035 --> 00:41.955
What the hell just happened?

00:41.995 --> 00:43.125
You better hope that he wakes up

00:43.175 --> 00:44.345
in time to get you this.

00:45.735 --> 00:47.135
ELIJAH: There's no way out.

00:47.175 --> 00:50.135
We're trapped here.

00:50.175 --> 00:53.965
KLAUS: In New Orleans,
bodies cannot be buried.

00:54.005 --> 00:56.705
Instead, in boxes above the ground,

00:56.745 --> 00:58.885
the dead cluster together.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.055
When a man passes on,

01:01.105 --> 01:04.015
his family tomb is cracked open.

01:04.065 --> 01:09.155
Old bones are shoved aside to
make room for fresh remains.

01:09.195 --> 01:13.115
Bloodlines rot, entangled.

01:14.985 --> 01:18.075
The houses are that way, too.

01:18.115 --> 01:20.685
Layer upon layer
of peeling paint,

01:20.735 --> 01:23.385
hiding little tragedies.

01:23.425 --> 01:25.695
Scorch marks from the fires.

01:25.735 --> 01:28.125
Waterlines on wallpaper.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.745
[thunder rumbling]

01:34.525 --> 01:38.315
These are the tombs
of the living,

01:38.355 --> 01:41.485
where we rot alongside
memories of our dead.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.795
[tinkling]

01:42.835 --> 01:44.845
Crowded with people
we have failed

01:44.885 --> 01:47.195
and those who have failed us,

01:47.235 --> 01:50.805
we are forced to struggle
with those we love.

01:50.845 --> 01:53.805
Every last exit is sealed.

01:53.855 --> 01:55.635
If you're thinking
about jumping, don't.

01:55.675 --> 01:57.115
I already tried it.

01:57.155 --> 01:58.945
I landed in the world's
most pretentious wine cellar.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.075
You sorted it by vintage.

02:02.515 --> 02:04.865
You don't remember, do you?

02:04.905 --> 02:07.865
I thought Marcel was intent
on retrieving your memories.

02:07.905 --> 02:09.475
He was. He failed.

02:09.514 --> 02:11.305
I still remember
absolutely nothing,

02:11.345 --> 02:12.695
and Antoinette is dying.

02:12.735 --> 02:15.745
Is she? Right.
Yes. I'd forgotten.

02:15.785 --> 02:18.095
What the hell are we doing here?
What is this place?

02:18.135 --> 02:19.965
This is dangerous,
you and I here together.

02:20.005 --> 02:22.225
We're not actually here
together, are we?

02:22.265 --> 02:24.405
Not physically, at least.
[sighs]

02:24.445 --> 02:26.315
It's called a Chambre de Chasse.

02:26.365 --> 02:28.845
It's a magical mental prison
designed to resemble our home.

02:28.885 --> 02:30.665
But don't worry.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.195
There's always a way out...
A game or a riddle.

02:33.235 --> 02:34.805
How do we solve this riddle?

02:34.845 --> 02:37.765
We don't do anything.

02:37.805 --> 02:39.855
We're square, you and I.

02:39.895 --> 02:41.635
You got Hayley killed,

02:41.685 --> 02:44.295
and Antoinette will die
because of me.

02:45.855 --> 02:48.465
I would hate to upset
that delicate balance.

02:48.515 --> 02:52.775
So I'm gonna find my way out,
and you're on your own.

03:23.145 --> 03:26.275
Who's there?

03:26.325 --> 03:28.285
Show yourself!

03:28.325 --> 03:30.895
REBEKAH: Oh, Nik.

03:32.985 --> 03:34.895
Always so dramatic.

03:34.935 --> 03:36.985
Rebekah.

03:38.945 --> 03:40.385
[chuckles]

03:42.205 --> 03:44.125
[sighs]

03:49.565 --> 03:53.265
[sighs] Bloody hell.

03:53.305 --> 03:56.745
My least favorite
recurring nightmare.

03:56.785 --> 04:01.095
I was in Corsica, drowning
my sorrows about Hayley,

04:01.145 --> 04:03.755
and I suddenly dropped.

04:03.795 --> 04:05.015
[scoffs]

04:05.055 --> 04:07.625
What I wouldn't give
to spend just a decade

04:07.665 --> 04:10.885
without being dragged into
a godforsaken Chambre de Chasse.

04:10.935 --> 04:13.235
Suppose you were
in a board meeting.

04:13.285 --> 04:16.505
I was waiting for my wife
to come home from work.

04:16.545 --> 04:20.635
Once again, ripped from complete
contentment for... this.

04:20.685 --> 04:22.375
Suppose I'll ask the obvious:

04:22.425 --> 04:24.165
Piss off any witches lately?

04:24.205 --> 04:27.345
Actually, my current enemies
are a group of hatemongers

04:27.385 --> 04:29.515
who see myself and my daughter
as abominations

04:29.555 --> 04:31.345
to the vampire race.

04:31.385 --> 04:32.915
The bigoted undead.

04:32.955 --> 04:35.735
That's new.
They must have a witch-for-hire.

04:35.785 --> 04:37.565
A witch that's spent
enough time here

04:37.615 --> 04:39.875
to replicate every detail.

04:39.915 --> 04:43.265
This is Elijah's prized Cheval Blanc.

04:43.315 --> 04:46.095
FREYA: The culprit may be closer to home.

04:46.145 --> 04:49.575
A witch who knows
the compound well

04:49.625 --> 04:53.235
and who doesn't trust you
to stay away from Elijah.

04:53.275 --> 04:55.285
Someone who would risk

04:55.325 --> 04:58.895
everything to save New Orleans
from plagues.

04:58.935 --> 05:00.595
Vincent.

05:00.635 --> 05:03.815
On the bright side,
he'd never harm Hope.

05:03.855 --> 05:06.815
You, on the other hand,
I expect he'll be shipping

05:06.855 --> 05:09.295
your bodies to the four corners
of the world.

05:09.335 --> 05:11.685
All of our bodies?

05:13.215 --> 05:15.255
He isn't here, is he?

05:15.305 --> 05:16.565
ELIJAH: He is.

05:18.345 --> 05:21.225
I think I might have just found
a way out of here.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.665
This wasn't here before.
What is it?

05:35.885 --> 05:38.285
It's representational magic.

05:38.325 --> 05:41.195
I expect there are keys,
one for each of us,

05:41.245 --> 05:42.985
hidden somewhere meaningful.

05:43.025 --> 05:44.765
Somewhere connected
to who we are.

05:44.805 --> 05:46.815
And for those of us
who don't remember who we are?

05:46.855 --> 05:48.895
I'll give Antoinette
your regards.

05:52.335 --> 05:55.515
Door won't open unless
all five locks are released.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.215
The only way out is together.

05:59.345 --> 06:00.955
Elijah,

06:00.995 --> 06:03.175
if we're to get through this
without bloodshed,

06:03.215 --> 06:06.045
I recommend that you go
to the corner of the house

06:06.095 --> 06:07.095
furthest from Nik.

06:09.225 --> 06:11.185
Come on. Follow me.

06:17.235 --> 06:18.275
Split up.

06:18.325 --> 06:20.365
We need to turn this
place upside down.

06:20.405 --> 06:21.885
I only just promised
my grieving daughter

06:21.935 --> 06:23.285
I wouldn't abandon her again.

06:24.505 --> 06:26.725
I can't be stuck here.

06:30.635 --> 06:32.115
Ominous weather.

06:32.165 --> 06:34.165
That's an indication
of what's actually happening

06:34.205 --> 06:35.205
in New Orleans.

06:35.255 --> 06:36.775
Hope and Klaus
are in the same city.

06:36.815 --> 06:40.035
The resulting consequence
is leaking into this reality.

06:41.475 --> 06:44.255
Here, this might jog
your memory.

06:44.305 --> 06:46.435
This is all the junk

06:46.475 --> 06:49.355
you deemed as worthy
of preserving.

06:51.315 --> 06:52.875
Ring any bells?

06:52.925 --> 06:57.355
You know, Klaus came to visit me
at my bar in France.

06:57.405 --> 06:59.275
Rebekah, too. You didn't.

06:59.315 --> 07:01.885
You and I have never
really had much in common

07:01.925 --> 07:03.885
besides our dashing good looks.

07:03.935 --> 07:07.935
And you and Freya more or less
murdered my wife, so...

07:10.895 --> 07:13.115
I'm...

07:13.155 --> 07:15.115
The journals.

07:15.155 --> 07:19.075
They may contain information
about what represents you,

07:19.125 --> 07:23.125
somewhere amongst the martyrdom
and self-righteousness.

07:25.385 --> 07:26.345
Wait.

07:28.525 --> 07:31.915
Did I ever apologize to you
for what I did?

07:33.355 --> 07:36.355
In your peculiar way, I suppose.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.485
Look, what matters
is that I got her back.

07:42.885 --> 07:46.145
Not everybody is so lucky.

08:00.725 --> 08:03.865
HAYLEY: This is your family's house?

08:07.345 --> 08:09.035
What the hell happened here?

08:09.085 --> 08:10.955
A battle, obviously.
They lost, I won.

08:10.995 --> 08:12.695
The world is right again.

08:12.735 --> 08:14.485
Why don't you find a bedroom.

08:14.525 --> 08:16.565
Preferably one that
hasn't been contaminated

08:16.615 --> 08:18.395
by Marcel's miscreant pests.

08:18.445 --> 08:19.875
I'm not staying here.

08:19.925 --> 08:21.535
This isn't a home.

08:21.575 --> 08:23.225
This-this is a war zone.

08:23.275 --> 08:24.575
You see that crest?

08:27.365 --> 08:28.455
My heir belongs here.

08:28.495 --> 08:30.935
What you want is of no consequence.

08:30.975 --> 08:33.155
Klaus, I can be your hostage,

08:33.195 --> 08:38.245
or we can try and be better than that.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.205
For our child.

08:40.245 --> 08:43.465
We can try and make her feel safe.

08:47.035 --> 08:49.735
I'll have someone clean this up.

08:49.775 --> 08:52.605
Why don't you take Kol's room.

08:53.785 --> 08:57.345
It has a fireplace.

08:57.395 --> 09:00.095
Klaus.

09:00.135 --> 09:04.665
I want to believe that this baby
means something to you.

09:04.705 --> 09:07.405
I want to believe in you.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.495
Don't let us down.

09:26.465 --> 09:29.205
REBEKAH: Nik, it's done.

09:32.475 --> 09:35.955
I think we've established that
there's no key in the crest.

09:35.995 --> 09:38.085
The thing was a relic anyway.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.605
[grunts]

09:42.175 --> 09:43.485
Marcel.

09:43.525 --> 09:44.485
Damn it!

09:44.525 --> 09:46.485
I got to go now.

09:46.525 --> 09:48.225
Hey!

09:48.265 --> 09:49.875
What game is Vincent playing?

09:49.925 --> 09:52.055
Oh, this has nothing to do
with Vincent.

09:52.095 --> 09:54.585
We got to get out of here.
The city is about to wash away.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.015
She's out of her damn mind.

09:56.055 --> 09:58.195
Who, Marcel?!
Who put you here?!

09:58.235 --> 10:01.845
It was Hope. Hope is responsible
for all of this.

10:07.205 --> 10:08.635
Ivy was telling Vincent and me

10:08.685 --> 10:10.815
all about the latest prophecy
when a hurricane showed up

10:10.855 --> 10:12.815
off the coast out of nowhere.

10:13.365 --> 10:15.445
A monsoon from the water
is the final curse before

10:15.495 --> 10:17.015
the Firstborns die.

10:27.155 --> 10:29.115
I went to go find you guys.

10:29.155 --> 10:31.075
Hope was at St. Anne's.

10:31.115 --> 10:33.855
She had Klaus and Elijah's
bodies laid out on the floor.

10:33.905 --> 10:36.255
She's gathering up all of you
to take back the power

10:36.295 --> 10:37.775
that's been split up inside of you.

10:37.815 --> 10:39.165
KLAUS: She can't do that.

10:39.215 --> 10:41.435
It'll destroy her.
That was the whole point.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.865
She threw me in here
when I tried to stop her.

10:43.915 --> 10:46.785
I can't leave until
you guys find your keys.

10:46.825 --> 10:48.435
REBEKAH: Well, she can't find my body.

10:48.485 --> 10:49.705
It's halfway across the world.

10:51.095 --> 10:52.835
KLAUS: She has help.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.095
I created hybrids with her blood;
They're sired to her.

10:55.145 --> 10:56.275
They'll do anything she asks.

10:57.705 --> 10:59.445
She'll take the power back.

10:59.495 --> 11:01.885
She'll end the curses,
she'll keep the firstborns safe,

11:01.935 --> 11:03.885
and then my daughter
as we know her

11:03.935 --> 11:06.155
will be forever lost
to darkness.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.945
[thunder rumbling]

11:17.035 --> 11:20.035
What was my relationship like
with your daughter?

11:21.735 --> 11:24.695
The irony of you expressing
interest in family...

11:24.735 --> 11:25.955
Listen, I got nothing
to go on here.

11:25.995 --> 11:28.005
You help me,
we all get out of here.

11:33.265 --> 11:37.535
The day she was born,
you gave her this.

11:41.315 --> 11:43.315
KLAUS: She needs a name, Hayley.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.935
[cooing]

11:47.975 --> 11:50.235
Zoe?

11:50.285 --> 11:53.115
Caitlin?

11:53.155 --> 11:54.115
Katherine?

11:54.155 --> 11:56.115
God, no.
[chuckles]

11:59.815 --> 12:03.255
I never knew I could
love something so much.

12:03.295 --> 12:06.165
It honestly feels...

12:06.215 --> 12:08.515
awful.

12:08.565 --> 12:11.045
Like it might kill me.

12:12.345 --> 12:14.265
It nearly did.

12:16.435 --> 12:20.265
I'm sorry the beginning
of her life was so violent.

12:20.315 --> 12:23.225
It's not your fault, Klaus.

12:25.365 --> 12:27.055
I know that you fought for us.

12:29.145 --> 12:32.365
You know, when Elijah thought
you were dead,

12:32.415 --> 12:36.285
he said we'd lost
our family's only hope.

12:38.075 --> 12:39.685
"Hope."

12:44.385 --> 12:46.995
Hope Mikaelson.

12:49.645 --> 12:54.565
Hope Andrea Mikaelson.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.005
You gave her her name.

13:21.205 --> 13:23.335
You got something
against literature?

13:23.375 --> 13:27.685
Well, these are the collective
works of William Shakespeare.

13:27.725 --> 13:30.035
Love, power, betrayal.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.685
How to thrive in the Mikaelson clan 101.

13:32.735 --> 13:35.215
Davina and I sent these to Hope
on her ninth birthday.

13:35.255 --> 13:38.435
How is Davina?

13:38.475 --> 13:40.915
You know, she doesn't call much
these days.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.485
Well, that's how
normal families work.

13:42.525 --> 13:45.045
You learn what you can,
and then you grow up.

13:45.095 --> 13:47.445
Join a cult, start a rock band,
find love,

13:47.485 --> 13:49.355
make your own family.

13:49.405 --> 13:53.275
Hmm. Doesn't that fly in the
face of "always and forever"?

13:53.315 --> 13:56.275
You know, to think I spent
a thousand years dying

13:56.325 --> 13:58.365
to be a part of that vow.

13:58.415 --> 14:01.155
What changed?

14:01.195 --> 14:03.245
I met a girl.

14:11.465 --> 14:14.125
Voilà.

14:14.165 --> 14:16.425
Four more keys to go.

14:17.735 --> 14:20.695
Why would your book of plays
be in the music room?

14:20.735 --> 14:22.345
Kids are messy?

14:22.395 --> 14:26.395
Yeah, but this room
doesn't even exist anymore.

14:26.435 --> 14:27.875
There was a storm.

14:27.915 --> 14:30.665
Everything was damaged.
That was at least a century ago.

14:30.705 --> 14:33.485
Hope's never even seen
this room.

14:38.585 --> 14:40.755
[thunder rumbling]

14:48.725 --> 14:51.555
It doesn't feel real yet.

14:53.425 --> 14:56.595
I guess I've always
been jealous of her.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.605
I was jealous
when I saw her with Hope.

14:58.645 --> 15:01.605
I was jealous
when she got married.

15:01.645 --> 15:03.785
I guess I'm even jealous
that she's dead.

15:03.825 --> 15:06.045
KOL: Wow, that's morbid.

15:06.085 --> 15:09.265
Freya, I'm trying
to sort out a puzzle.

15:09.305 --> 15:12.135
A Chambre de Chasse of this
size would be constructed

15:12.185 --> 15:14.965
from the depth of memory, right?

15:15.835 --> 15:17.225
But there's a room here

15:17.275 --> 15:19.105
that hasn't existed
for a century.

15:19.145 --> 15:20.715
And Hope would've never seen it.

15:20.755 --> 15:22.365
Oh, that's impossible.

15:22.405 --> 15:24.415
Wiped out by a storm.

15:24.455 --> 15:26.065
The music room.

15:26.105 --> 15:28.455
Oh, I brought you there

15:28.505 --> 15:31.635
during the 1914 Christmas party,

15:31.675 --> 15:35.115
where we drank, Marcel
played "Carol of the Bells,"

15:35.155 --> 15:37.295
Niklaus stabbed me in the heart.

15:37.335 --> 15:38.515
You remember.

15:38.555 --> 15:41.385
Kol.

15:41.425 --> 15:45.515
KLAUS: Freya, what have you done?

15:50.855 --> 15:52.115
Hope asked for my help.

15:52.405 --> 15:54.235
So you decided to lend a
hand in her destruction?

15:54.275 --> 15:55.675
The plagues
are nearing their end.

15:55.715 --> 15:57.495
All it would take is one
more meeting between you

15:57.545 --> 15:59.715
to end it all;
Something needed to be done.

16:01.015 --> 16:03.445
I was leaving New Orleans
when you struck me down.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.325
Who's to say you wouldn't be weak again?

16:05.365 --> 16:08.495
Test the limits to lay your eyes
on Hope, as you did with Elijah?

16:08.545 --> 16:10.235
Don't put this on me!

16:10.285 --> 16:11.105
[thunder rumbling]

16:11.155 --> 16:13.115
I was trying to protect her.

16:13.155 --> 16:15.155
Perhaps I was wrong
to have faith in you.

16:15.195 --> 16:16.855
Maybe your obligations
to family were

16:16.895 --> 16:19.425
infringed upon by other plans.
Keelin's back, isn't she?

16:19.465 --> 16:22.385
Stop it, Klaus.

16:22.425 --> 16:27.775
I have sacrificed everything
for you, for Hope.

16:29.565 --> 16:32.395
I understand that you were
trying to protect her,

16:32.435 --> 16:35.085
but that is not
what she needs right now.

16:35.135 --> 16:36.835
I'm her father.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.575
I decide what she needs
and what she doesn't.

16:38.615 --> 16:40.445
Do you?

16:40.485 --> 16:44.225
Because while you were gone,
I was here, with Hayley.

16:44.275 --> 16:47.105
Hope did everything
we ever asked of her.

16:47.145 --> 16:50.535
The one time she acted out, it
was because she missed her dad.

16:52.585 --> 16:53.845
You want to see what she does

16:53.895 --> 16:56.505
with a lifetime
of missing both her parents?

16:58.545 --> 17:01.375
We have to let her make
her own choices.

17:01.425 --> 17:03.165
She's a child.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.595
Her childhood ended
three days ago,

17:05.645 --> 17:07.555
when she lost her mother.

17:09.775 --> 17:13.085
And as long as that magic
is inside of you, Klaus,

17:13.125 --> 17:15.565
she's as good as orphaned.

17:15.605 --> 17:18.265
Look, we've all done
dangerous things

17:18.305 --> 17:22.395
for family, and we've seen
each other through it.

17:24.575 --> 17:26.224
Now it's her turn.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.405
Freya.

17:27.444 --> 17:30.235
You have to stop her.

17:30.275 --> 17:33.235
No.

17:43.635 --> 17:45.985
[thunder rumbling]

17:46.025 --> 17:48.205
I was avoiding you.

17:50.465 --> 17:52.425
Look, I got to ask.

17:52.475 --> 17:54.905
How come your pain-in-the-ass
brother Kol can be happy

17:54.955 --> 17:56.825
with someone he loves,
but you can't?

17:56.865 --> 17:59.125
Can this conversation
please wait?

17:59.175 --> 18:00.785
Till when?

18:00.825 --> 18:03.835
I mean, tomorrow you'll be gone
or the world will be on fire.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.095
The world ison fire, Marcel.

18:06.135 --> 18:08.575
Right now, I just...
[sighs]

18:08.615 --> 18:10.405
I need to find this key.

18:13.275 --> 18:15.715
Uh, Hope's a teenager
with secrets.

18:15.755 --> 18:18.145
She knows all the good
hiding places.

18:18.195 --> 18:22.545
You remember when this room
used to be yours?

18:22.585 --> 18:25.065
And I was a lovestruck idiot,
writing you letters?

18:26.505 --> 18:28.555
You hid them where Klaus
wouldn't find them,

18:28.595 --> 18:29.725
but I would.

18:36.645 --> 18:38.565
[sighs]: Thank God.

18:42.605 --> 18:45.435
You know, I used to think
I could choose when to love you.

18:45.485 --> 18:48.875
You'd leave, and then I'd fall
back into the arms of this city.

18:48.915 --> 18:51.135
Every time.

18:51.185 --> 18:53.225
But that's not working anymore.

18:54.705 --> 18:57.235
I love you, Rebekah.

18:57.275 --> 18:59.925
I always have and I always will.

19:01.365 --> 19:03.625
The least you could do
is tell me why you left me

19:03.675 --> 19:05.285
standing alone at city hall.

19:05.325 --> 19:07.935
Why would you want
to be loved by me, Marcel?

19:07.985 --> 19:09.545
My family is cursed.

19:09.595 --> 19:11.725
Oh, bull. Look, I'm not Hayley
and I'm not Cami, all right?

19:11.765 --> 19:12.895
I'm not gonna die on you.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.465
I'm not worried
I'm gonna kill you.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.685
There are far worse ways
that I could destroy you.

19:18.735 --> 19:20.955
Oh, I know.

19:20.995 --> 19:23.435
You're doing a pretty good job
of it right now.

19:52.415 --> 19:55.415
HAYLEY: Who knew that an
11-year-old's birthday party

19:55.465 --> 19:56.765
would be so exhausting?

19:56.815 --> 19:58.685
[chuckles]

19:58.725 --> 20:01.555
Oh, she, uh, she really liked
the bike you got her.

20:01.605 --> 20:03.865
Well, she doesn't need to know
where it's from.

20:03.905 --> 20:06.085
Look, I can't fix this

20:06.125 --> 20:09.735
if I don't know
why you two aren't speaking.

20:09.785 --> 20:11.785
Well, that's actually why
I'm calling.

20:11.825 --> 20:15.785
We no longer need to continue
having these little chats.

20:15.835 --> 20:17.795
You've done a fine job with her.

20:17.835 --> 20:19.965
And I trust you'll continue to do as such.

20:20.005 --> 20:22.665
Since when do Mikaelsons
bail on each other?

20:22.705 --> 20:24.145
You're not a Mikaelson.

20:25.665 --> 20:27.625
You've escaped us, Hayley.

20:27.665 --> 20:29.195
For God's sake, take the win.

20:29.235 --> 20:31.195
I'm not giving up on you, Klaus.

20:31.235 --> 20:32.675
[beep]

20:48.515 --> 20:50.085
MARCEL: Kol and I already
searched this room,

20:50.125 --> 20:52.785
unless you're just here
for the trip down memory lane.

20:52.825 --> 20:54.085
There is no memory lane.

20:54.135 --> 20:56.655
That's what I'm told.

20:56.695 --> 20:58.395
Though I find it
very hard to believe,

20:58.435 --> 21:00.525
considering Vincent finished
the spell.

21:00.575 --> 21:02.315
Maybe Vincent should
find himself a new hobby,

21:02.355 --> 21:04.575
'cause clearly this witchcraft
thing isn't working out for him.

21:04.615 --> 21:06.705
Either that, or whatever
meddling you did

21:06.755 --> 21:07.925
fried my brain.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.275
You don't remember teaching me

21:10.325 --> 21:12.755
how to play the piano
in this room?

21:12.805 --> 21:14.805
Or welcoming me home

21:14.845 --> 21:16.895
from the war, in the courtyard?

21:18.505 --> 21:21.635
How about exiling me
from the city that I built?

21:21.685 --> 21:23.855
Or ripping my heart out,

21:23.895 --> 21:25.985
before dropping my body
off a bridge?

21:26.035 --> 21:28.905
No.Well, I guess if I were you,

21:28.945 --> 21:30.255
I wouldn't want
to remember either.

21:30.295 --> 21:33.515
What are you suggesting
here, Marcellus?

21:35.825 --> 21:37.135
"Marcellus."

21:39.435 --> 21:42.175
I guess something in your memory
is working after all.

21:44.965 --> 21:47.145
[flames crackling]

21:51.755 --> 21:53.665
What are you burning?

21:53.715 --> 21:56.105
Ancient history.

21:59.505 --> 22:01.285
You know, you're all the same.

22:01.325 --> 22:03.895
You setting fire to your guilt,

22:03.935 --> 22:05.765
Rebekah pretending
she doesn't love me,

22:05.815 --> 22:07.425
and Elijah...

22:08.725 --> 22:11.685
lying about his memories.

22:13.815 --> 22:15.255
What do you mean?

22:15.295 --> 22:17.305
He just called me "Marcellus."

22:20.215 --> 22:23.085
Things are creeping in,
only nothing of substance,

22:23.135 --> 22:24.875
nothing that hurts.

22:24.915 --> 22:28.575
If Elijah doesn't know who he
is, it's not because of magic.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.665
It's because he doesn't want
to remember.

22:30.705 --> 22:32.575
[metal clinks]

22:37.975 --> 22:39.975
Well, now he's gonna have to,

22:40.015 --> 22:43.675
if he wants to save
his girlfriend's life.

22:47.605 --> 22:49.515
[thunder rumbling]

22:49.565 --> 22:53.085
All right, Hope,
where did you put his key?

23:11.545 --> 23:13.455
[door creaks]

23:29.645 --> 23:31.605
You've been lying to us all day.

23:31.645 --> 23:32.984
You remember everything.

23:33.985 --> 23:35.685
I remember nothing.

23:35.725 --> 23:36.165
[panting]

23:36.205 --> 23:40.475
For all I know, I was born
at a bus stop seven years ago.

23:41.905 --> 23:43.995
Lie.

23:44.915 --> 23:46.735
Why would I lie?

23:46.785 --> 23:48.825
I want out of here
as bad as you.

23:48.875 --> 23:51.045
What's going on? Our brother has
been deliberately

23:51.095 --> 23:53.785
repressing his memories
to keep us trapped here.

23:53.835 --> 23:56.795
I am not your brother!

23:56.835 --> 23:58.795
And I didn't ask
for any of this.

23:58.835 --> 23:59.925
You most certainly did.

23:59.965 --> 24:01.185
It's not like you
held a family vote

24:01.235 --> 24:03.325
before you decided
to erase all of us.

24:03.365 --> 24:04.755
You ever consider
the possibility

24:04.805 --> 24:06.195
that perhaps you don't
even want me back?

24:06.235 --> 24:08.105
I mean, it seems to me
that I make you all

24:08.155 --> 24:09.375
incredibly miserable.

24:09.415 --> 24:10.935
We all make each other
miserable.

24:10.985 --> 24:14.155
But through it all, we are
family, and we made a vow.

24:14.205 --> 24:15.815
Always and forever.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.945
I made another vow!

24:17.985 --> 24:19.685
And the woman that I pledged

24:19.725 --> 24:22.775
my life to is out there,
and she is dying.

24:24.685 --> 24:28.345
So, if you believe in any way
that-that I am your family,

24:28.385 --> 24:31.955
then I'm begging you...
I'm beggingyou... help me.

24:32.005 --> 24:34.695
When Vincent and Marcel were
recovering your memories,

24:34.745 --> 24:36.095
what did you see?

24:40.885 --> 24:42.705
A white corridor.

24:44.235 --> 24:46.365
A long white corridor
with a red door.

24:46.405 --> 24:48.585
That's where you hide the things
you don't want to remember.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.755
You've been doing it
for a thousand years.

24:50.805 --> 24:51.895
Then what happened?

24:51.935 --> 24:54.505
I tried to open the door.

24:55.985 --> 24:58.855
The handle was on fire.
It was a searing heat.

24:58.895 --> 25:00.855
I mean, I've been in broad
daylight without my ring,

25:00.905 --> 25:05.075
and I've never, ever experienced
any heat like it.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.255
So you know how it feels

25:06.295 --> 25:08.695
to have your flesh melt
from your bones,

25:08.735 --> 25:10.695
have your insides
turned to lava.

25:10.735 --> 25:14.215
Because that pain is
the last thing Hayley knew.

25:15.475 --> 25:17.305
No swift and painless
death for her.

25:17.355 --> 25:19.355
Just raw fire!

25:20.965 --> 25:22.535
It's true.

25:22.575 --> 25:25.575
And that is
what's behind your door:

25:25.625 --> 25:29.105
The truth about what you did
to the woman you love.

25:29.145 --> 25:31.455
The woman I love is Antoinette.

25:31.495 --> 25:34.105
How can Antoinette possibly
hold a candle to Hayley,

25:34.155 --> 25:35.805
to the way that
you felt about her?

25:35.845 --> 25:37.065
You loved her.

25:37.115 --> 25:41.415
I mean, did I? Did I really?

25:41.465 --> 25:42.985
Are you sure that my feelings
weren't simply

25:43.025 --> 25:46.905
the product of my ridiculous
crusade to try and save you?

25:46.945 --> 25:48.905
Any excuse whatsoever

25:48.945 --> 25:54.085
just to maintain that
pathetic entanglement...

25:54.125 --> 25:55.995
of always and forever.

25:57.955 --> 25:58.955
[thunder rumbling]

26:02.745 --> 26:05.135
The storm's escalating.
We're running out of time.

26:05.185 --> 26:07.925
We're wasting it
rehashing ten centuries

26:07.965 --> 26:10.495
of separation anxiety;
And none of this

26:10.535 --> 26:12.275
has anything to do with our vow.

26:12.315 --> 26:14.145
It has everything
to do with our vow.

26:14.195 --> 26:16.935
Why do you think we never tore
Elijah and Hayley apart?

26:16.975 --> 26:19.505
You knew that Hayley would
stay close because of Hope,

26:19.545 --> 26:20.935
and as long as Elijah was
in love with Hayley,

26:20.985 --> 26:22.245
he would never
leave you, either.

26:22.285 --> 26:23.895
But he did leave!

26:25.335 --> 26:27.945
Elijah was always there for me.

26:27.985 --> 26:29.035
Swooping in

26:29.075 --> 26:30.645
when my rage
got the better of me,

26:30.685 --> 26:32.295
setting me on a path
to redemption.

26:32.335 --> 26:34.865
For a thousand years,
he made me need him.

26:36.345 --> 26:40.475
My brother was my greatest ally.

26:40.525 --> 26:42.045
He was the only one

26:42.085 --> 26:45.355
who could give me a chance
of being worthy of Hope.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.655
And he was my best friend.

26:49.225 --> 26:52.095
You killed him.

26:54.275 --> 26:57.105
And I hate you for that.

26:57.145 --> 26:59.935
[grunts]

26:59.975 --> 27:01.105
[gasping]

27:05.455 --> 27:07.855
KLAUS: Hope's taking the power from us.

27:07.895 --> 27:09.075
There's no stopping it.

27:09.115 --> 27:10.725
It's too late.

27:13.725 --> 27:14.945
Oh...

27:19.255 --> 27:20.435
[grunts]

27:30.095 --> 27:31.965
[water dripping]

27:43.755 --> 27:45.715
[quiet hissing]

27:45.755 --> 27:48.325
Great.

28:08.835 --> 28:10.225
Rebekah.

28:10.275 --> 28:12.365
Elijah's key, I got it.

28:12.405 --> 28:13.885
How did you find it?

28:13.925 --> 28:16.545
Well...

28:16.585 --> 28:18.415
Cole's key was in
As You Like It.

28:18.455 --> 28:19.805
Act one, scene three.

28:19.845 --> 28:21.675
"Now go we in
content to liberty,

28:21.715 --> 28:23.245
not banishment."

28:23.285 --> 28:25.765
Hope knows you can't stay.
She's setting you free.

28:27.895 --> 28:31.165
Rebekah, she put yours on the
necklace that you gave her,

28:31.205 --> 28:33.385
hidden somewhere
safe and secret.

28:33.425 --> 28:35.955
Just like I hid her
when she was a baby.

28:35.995 --> 28:39.955
Klaus found his in letters
Hayley wrote to him about Hope.

28:39.995 --> 28:41.215
Get on with it.

28:42.955 --> 28:46.485
Elijah has been a lot of
things to me over the years.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.575
After you ripped my heart out,

28:48.615 --> 28:51.005
all you represent to me
is death.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.885
After what happened to Hayley,

28:54.925 --> 28:58.325
Hope sees you the same way.

29:00.715 --> 29:04.455
Your key was in a coffin,
in the dungeon.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.555
Come on.

29:11.595 --> 29:14.335
Let's be done with
my daughter's maze of metaphors.

29:42.885 --> 29:44.585
Oh, bloody hell.

29:44.625 --> 29:47.805
Now we're in
Elijah's mental maze.

29:47.845 --> 29:51.025
Of all the hells
I've had to endure...

29:51.065 --> 29:52.505
The door.

29:54.245 --> 29:56.555
What is this, Hope's revenge?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.945
Imprison me till I reclaim
all of my memories,

29:58.995 --> 30:01.865
forcing me to accept
accountability for all of this?

30:01.905 --> 30:03.255
KOL: Well,

30:03.295 --> 30:05.995
as much as I love a cherry
on top of a scheme...

30:08.045 --> 30:10.305
I have somewhere else to be.

30:38.075 --> 30:40.685
[panting]

30:43.905 --> 30:47.255
Nik, we can't just
leave him here.

30:47.295 --> 30:48.955
He can find his own way out.

30:48.995 --> 30:50.045
We made a vow.

30:50.085 --> 30:51.475
I made a vow to my brother.

30:51.525 --> 30:53.045
That's just the man who
got Hope's mother killed.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.875
I thought the same
thing about you once.

30:54.915 --> 30:57.095
Do you remember our mother?

30:57.135 --> 30:59.445
Before all of the turmoil?
Because I do.

30:59.485 --> 31:02.055
I remember when she would
put flowers in my braid,

31:02.095 --> 31:05.015
and I remember when she would
sing to us in the morning.

31:05.055 --> 31:06.625
And then you killed her.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.365
Why are you
bringing this up now?

31:08.405 --> 31:10.545
Because we are capable
of doing terrible things,

31:10.585 --> 31:13.365
but we are also capable
of forgiveness.

31:17.595 --> 31:20.685
It's just a door, Elijah!
Open it!

31:21.815 --> 31:24.115
[panting]

31:24.165 --> 31:26.335
Go on, Rebekah.

31:26.385 --> 31:30.425
We'll be right behind you,
both of us.

31:35.265 --> 31:37.215
[gasps]

31:45.445 --> 31:47.095
You killed my brother

31:47.145 --> 31:49.015
when you let Hayley die.

31:49.055 --> 31:51.535
Because despite what you might
think, you did love her.

31:51.585 --> 31:54.365
Not 'cause of some family
obsession, because of her.

31:54.415 --> 31:56.235
Because she believed
in something better

31:56.285 --> 31:59.025
for all of us.

31:59.065 --> 32:02.375
And because she fought for it
when we couldn't.

32:05.115 --> 32:07.295
Come on.

32:09.165 --> 32:13.295
I don't know who you'll be on
the other side of that door,

32:13.345 --> 32:15.955
but I know that you
can't open it alone.

32:18.695 --> 32:21.435
You need me.

32:35.145 --> 32:36.755
[gasps]

32:56.345 --> 32:57.775
Elijah.

32:59.215 --> 33:01.215
HAYLEY: Elijah.

33:20.805 --> 33:22.455
[exhales]

33:32.205 --> 33:33.725
[crying]

33:42.175 --> 33:44.085
[panting]

33:47.305 --> 33:49.135
[Elijah cries out]

33:55.185 --> 33:56.925
[sobbing]

33:56.965 --> 33:58.885
[cries out]

34:02.105 --> 34:04.015
[panting]

34:26.085 --> 34:28.915
There's enough here
to cure Antoinette.

34:35.185 --> 34:38.275
If what you desire
is to let go of your past

34:38.315 --> 34:41.795
and build a future with her,

34:41.835 --> 34:44.755
then you should go to her.

34:51.065 --> 34:52.804
Niklaus.

35:01.555 --> 35:03.945
[inhales deeply]

35:15.005 --> 35:17.175
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

35:20.315 --> 35:21.925
You've watched
the French Quarter

35:21.965 --> 35:24.095
triumph over
far worse than this.

35:24.145 --> 35:27.235
There's always
a new storm coming.

35:30.275 --> 35:33.235
[chuckles softly]

35:33.285 --> 35:35.415
I want that.

35:35.455 --> 35:37.245
A life with context.

35:37.285 --> 35:39.945
I want to have
children and grow old.

35:39.985 --> 35:43.035
I want to...
die a brittle lady

35:43.075 --> 35:46.295
with spots on my hands
and clouds in my eyes.

35:48.865 --> 35:51.215
But I'll never have that.

35:53.825 --> 35:57.395
You get to have
so much more than that.

35:57.435 --> 36:00.745
We get to bear witness,
to watch history unfold,

36:00.785 --> 36:05.225
to see barriers fall,
to see the oppressed rise.

36:05.275 --> 36:07.965
We get to watch it all.

36:08.015 --> 36:10.315
Together.

36:10.365 --> 36:12.105
Isn't that worth it?

36:14.805 --> 36:19.025
That's why you're so great
at being a vampire, Marcel.

36:19.065 --> 36:20.595
You chose this.

36:24.555 --> 36:26.295
[sighs]

36:26.335 --> 36:27.725
I didn't have a choice.

36:27.775 --> 36:31.165
I'm cursed and...

36:31.205 --> 36:33.125
I'm angry.

36:35.605 --> 36:39.875
I don't want you to promise to
be by my side while I fester.

36:45.395 --> 36:47.665
'Cause I love you, Marcel.

36:49.575 --> 36:52.975
That's why I won't let
my sadness destroy you.

37:14.255 --> 37:17.345
It used to be noise.

37:17.385 --> 37:19.085
Now it's music.

37:19.125 --> 37:20.345
Antoinette.

37:20.385 --> 37:22.565
Elijah... [panting]Shh, shh, shh.

37:22.605 --> 37:25.135
Shh, shh.

37:25.175 --> 37:26.485
I'm here.

37:26.525 --> 37:29.355
Drink.

37:29.395 --> 37:31.095
[panting]

37:36.405 --> 37:38.585
[breathing slows]

37:49.675 --> 37:51.465
Thought I'd lost you.

37:55.515 --> 37:57.335
[chuckles softly]

38:08.305 --> 38:09.785
Elijah.

38:22.585 --> 38:24.755
Forgive me.

38:36.465 --> 38:38.645
I need the room.

38:38.685 --> 38:41.165
Hope is fine.

38:41.205 --> 38:44.125
No fevers, no magical outbursts.

38:44.165 --> 38:47.045
Yeah, I just looked in on her.

38:47.085 --> 38:49.305
She's practically comatose.

38:49.345 --> 38:50.475
She's asleep.

38:51.565 --> 38:53.615
She deserves the rest.

38:53.655 --> 38:55.445
You should be proud of her.

38:55.485 --> 38:57.965
Your 15-year-old
just saved an entire city,

38:58.005 --> 39:00.575
and no one will know
to thank her for it.

39:00.615 --> 39:04.495
I said I need the room.
