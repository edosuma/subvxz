WEBVTT

00:36.912 --> 00:39.748
Kate? There you are.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.460
You're supposed to be sleeping.

00:45.045 --> 00:49.466
Every single client, Martin.
They hacked every single client.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.718
And we've reached out
to every single client.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.679
Who the fuck is doing this to us?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.389
We'll get through it.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.432
Will we?

00:59.268 --> 01:00.477
Alice called.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.938
She said we specialize
in keeping people out of the news,

01:03.021 --> 01:05.107
yet we've been the only story for days.

01:05.691 --> 01:06.775
It's her job to worry.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.485
Then she needs a raise.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.824
She wants to know about Cresswell.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.454
He is who we thought he was.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.271
Come on. Come on, Dora. Good girl.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.734
Dora. Dora!

02:31.944 --> 02:32.986
Stop!

02:38.951 --> 02:40.244
Dora.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.678
There's been no official comment

02:57.761 --> 03:01.014
following the latest twist
in the Leo Newman kidnapping case.

03:01.515 --> 03:05.686
After the coordinated hack on clients
of PR giant Cooper Newman,

03:05.769 --> 03:09.273
messages urging Leo's mother,
Katherine, to "tell the truth,"

03:09.356 --> 03:11.483
have appeared
on digital signs and billboards

03:11.567 --> 03:13.402
on both sides of the Atlantic.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.697
There's also no comment
on the man believed to be Eric Cresswell,

03:16.780 --> 03:20.242
who again appeared on the hacker's
most recent video demand.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.704
Do we know exactly what time
they went off-grid?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.747
…it seems pressure will continue to build…

03:25.831 --> 03:28.125
No, because they weren't
under surveillance.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.294
…and address the kidnappers directly…

03:30.377 --> 03:33.213
unless UK and US forces
working on the case

03:33.297 --> 03:35.174
make a breakthrough in locating Leo.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.089
Let me call you after.
All we have is the DB.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.468
-Okay, anything else? Okay.
-It's good. Yes, it's still here.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.677
I'll call you back later.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.056
-What do you have?
-Confirmation that the cottage

04:24.139 --> 04:26.683
was the UK residence
of the man found dead at the bridge.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.894
Any confirmed ID?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.187
Samuel Brolin,

04:30.854 --> 04:32.731
according to the neighbor
and the utility companies.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.609
But the property is owned
by a company in Israel.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.696
So it's an alias.
So what, what else is the neighbor saying?

04:40.489 --> 04:43.408
-"Why the hell didn't you come sooner?"
-And why didn't we?

04:43.492 --> 04:46.703
Because the call was only urgent when
the address had been linked to our body.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.122
But he gave positive IDs?

04:49.206 --> 04:52.835
On Tilson and McAllister, yes.
But he didn't see any of the others.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.712
They burned out his vehicle
when they abandoned it

04:55.796 --> 04:58.298
but SOCO have blood in Brolin's car
and in the house.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.675
We don't know whose yet.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.303
It's a hell of a lot more
than we have here though.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.514
It still is pretty clear
what happened here.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.974
Oh, yeah?

05:08.559 --> 05:10.686
They were trying to get out of the country
and something went wrong.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.062
Based on what evidence?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.440
-We're at an airfield.
-But we don't know if they were.

05:15.524 --> 05:16.942
Let alone if they planned
to get on a plane.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.110
For God's sake. They're running!

05:18.193 --> 05:20.821
And even if they were here,
it wasn't necessarily by choice.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.240
We know Tilson met up with McAllister
at some point,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.492
plus we know Monique wasn't even
part of the kidnap gang.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.869
Maybe that's why she's dead.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.705
You really think Natalie Thompson
would be party to that?

05:29.788 --> 05:31.456
Maybe she lost the argument.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.251
What I really think is you have
underestimated these people

05:34.334 --> 05:35.335
right from the beginning.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.881
-And you, maybe.
-What's that?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.383
I'm ex-military, Scott.
I have seen operations like this before.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.261
This scene's been cleaned.
There's no shell casings, no tire marks.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.597
There are bullet holes in the walls
and the floor, but no blood

05:46.680 --> 05:48.265
-apart from Monique's.
-What's your point?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.892
You wanted them deported
from the beginning,

05:49.975 --> 05:51.894
then you went over my head
to get surveillance pulled.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.938
Because I knew that Tilson would be
trying to skip the country!

05:55.022 --> 05:59.484
Look, I understand you feel responsible,
okay, but I am FBI, not CIA.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.197
You seriously think I sent
a rendition team to snatch these people?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.115
If I had, they'd have been
in a dark site hours ago.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.450
We don't have time for this.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.493
They wouldn't be
in some goddamn country cottage.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.413
They did this. Not us! Hey, we're talking!

06:11.496 --> 06:12.664
Should we find them?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.628
The next step is
getting passports, so I'll need photos.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.172
Hey, can I take 'em?
I can take 'em.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.133
Well, I suppose we should let him
make himself useful.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.927
Still not sure
what he brings to the party.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.804
Well, with all due respect, you're not
exactly the most approachable person.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.348
Whereas I can talk to people.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.266
People like to talk to me.
People tend to like me.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.685
-I don't like you.
-Well, you're the exception.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.104
Does anybody like him?

06:36.855 --> 06:37.856
Yeah.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.359
Yeah, I like him.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.073
Who found this car that we just stole?

06:46.156 --> 06:49.201
Once the pictures are done,
you three get the next train to London.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.371
And I need 80 grand in clean money
by 10:00 a.m.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.415
Send instructions to this number
via the app I've specified.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.709
-By 10:00?
-Are you nuts?

06:57.793 --> 06:59.711
Don't ask questions
you don't wanna hear the answer to.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.755
-You hacked Cooper Newman PR.
-Yeah, that took weeks.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.966
You asked to come.
Wanna get to Martin Copeland or not?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.930
-Okay.
-So, figure it out. Ten o'clock.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.265
Don't let me down.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.810
We rendezvous at 1530
in Battersea Park, okay?

07:14.893 --> 07:16.854
-What about me?
-You're coming with me.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.689
-Why?
-'Cause I don't trust you.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.484
Now, you'll all be tempted
to contact your people. Don't.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.612
Every risk you take now puts me at risk.
So do as you're told.

07:25.696 --> 07:29.366
Or one way or another, you'll never see
your loved ones again. All right?

07:30.409 --> 07:33.787
Now, when we get to London,
pick up new outfits, change your hair.

07:33.871 --> 07:37.249
If we're gonna make it through
an airport, we all need to look different.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.460
Now, run it once more. Quickly.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.839
-Always be the gray man.
-Or woman.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.842
Don't stand out or act out of character.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.847
Be in a couple. Couples get stopped less.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.515
Especially when they're arguing.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.851
Always have an objective in mind.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.477
Anything but running from the police.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.522
Don't be first or last.
You're more likely to be remembered.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.818
Try to make out
like you're part of a larger group.

08:04.902 --> 08:08.071
Don't make eye contact.
Don't get into stupid arguments.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.033
Anybody questions you,
be generic in your replies

08:11.116 --> 08:12.659
and have someone you know in mind.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.077
You'll remember details.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.038
And always remember,

08:16.121 --> 08:17.873
we think that other people
are interested in us,

08:17.956 --> 08:19.958
but really they're only interested
in themselves.

08:20.626 --> 08:24.046
So, act natural. Try not to show nerves.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.465
You'll be amazed
at what you can get away with.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.677
What exactly is
the truth the kidnappers are demanding?

08:30.761 --> 08:33.514
If Katherine Newman knows,
she's not letting on.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.558
A popular support for the Tell the Truth
movement appears to be building.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.604
Yesterday evening, an anonymous group
hacked advertising screens

08:40.687 --> 08:42.313
on the London Underground.

08:42.397 --> 08:46.360
This was outside Cooper Newman's
head office in Chicago a few hours ago.

08:46.443 --> 08:50.572
There have been similar acts of
vandalism reported across the country

08:50.656 --> 08:52.074
and, indeed, worldwide

08:52.157 --> 08:56.161
as the Tell the Truth message
increasingly becomes a demand.

08:56.245 --> 09:00.707
Vandalism. Hacking.
They never win public sympathy.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.670
It's pretty ironic they're demanding
the truth while wearing masks, huh?

09:04.753 --> 09:06.505
Alice was right to be worried.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.384
We both know how bad the optics are.

09:10.968 --> 09:14.054
Hey, there's a hell of a lot
of positive comment online.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.140
I know.
You asked Caitlin to show me, and she did.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.686
She didn't tell me that
most of the content was generated

09:20.769 --> 09:22.479
by people working for us.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.439
She didn't need to.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.443
We're at war here, Kate.
Same strategies apply.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.320
I get it.

09:30.404 --> 09:34.783
You were calling IOP Energy.
Well, what did Amy say?

09:34.867 --> 09:36.827
That she'll only speak with you.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.705
Well, I'm not leaving
New York. Not without Leo.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.832
If she wants to see me, she can come here.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.458
She arrives this afternoon.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.881
Even if Cresswell is still out there,

09:49.381 --> 09:52.426
he's worked pretty hard
to stay off the map for 25 years.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.052
What about his paper?

09:54.136 --> 09:56.054
Nobody has access to that.

09:56.972 --> 09:57.973
Nobody.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.226
You have to trust me, Kate.
This was all dealt with years ago.

10:04.188 --> 10:08.150
If he can be found,
we better get there first.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.420
So how'd you get into your line of work?

10:28.504 --> 10:30.214
I mean, I know you were in the army,
but what,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.883
were you military or paramilitary? Or--

10:41.683 --> 10:43.977
Can you at least tell me which
junction we're gettin' off at?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.562
I'd like to look out for the exits.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.649
Nope? Okay.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.995
Listen, Sean.

11:03.205 --> 11:06.750
My dad hates me,
but I'm very close with my mom

11:06.834 --> 11:09.086
and I'd like to tell her that I'm okay
before we leave.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.589
-So, would that be something I--
-Stop talking or I'll shoot you.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.350
Put Reuben on speaker.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.314
-Sir?
-Where are you?

11:29.398 --> 11:32.067
Heading back to base.
The scene was completely clean.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.987
I've had an update
from forensics at the cottage.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.072
Fingerprint matches for all five suspects.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.575
This is party line, sir.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.702
Hi, it's Scott.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.454
Hi, Scott.
They also have two sets of bloods.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.915
One for Monique Thompson,
the other is Eddie Walker.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.712
Well, we're covering the hospitals.
Any more on the guy who owned the house?

11:51.795 --> 11:53.964
Inquiries are out with agencies worldwide.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.800
But our priority has to be finding
the five suspects.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.969
Agreed. Stay in contact.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.433
Well, if they're together,
they should be easier to track.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.686
Not as easy as if we kept them
under surveillance.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.403
We are now arriving at Didcot parkway.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.780
Change here for services to Hereford,

12:18.864 --> 12:20.991
Banbury and Oxford.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.911
If you are leaving us here…

12:24.620 --> 12:26.038
How's it going?

12:26.121 --> 12:28.665
All right. I'm in the offshore account.
I've got the money.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.959
Now the tricky part.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.129
The fuck?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.633
What is she doing?

12:43.889 --> 12:46.350
ANPR picked it up
a few miles outside London.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.228
-Turned off before the next checkpoint.
-That could be Tilson.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.856
But is that McAllister?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.066
Can't be sure.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.109
We've got eyes out for the car
all over London,

12:56.193 --> 12:58.654
plus ARVs in plain clothes
doing a street search.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.698
It makes sense they split up.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.493
-We got the airports covered?
-And private airfields.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.995
They won't get out of the country
without being spotted.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.708
How'd you get
five convincing passports this fast?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.794
There's nothing you can't get
as long as you can pay.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.295
Aadesh won't let us down.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.673
I've never seen anybody like him
when it comes to computers. He's--

13:17.756 --> 13:20.801
These guys are dangerous,
so I need you to not talk right now.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.136
-Right. Yeah. I can do that.
-I mean, at all.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.722
Yeah, I completely understand.
I was just wondering where exactly--

13:25.806 --> 13:26.932
Can you--

13:27.015 --> 13:28.016
Yeah.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.900
You must be desperate.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.031
Who is this with you?

13:43.907 --> 13:45.492
Who is he?

13:45.576 --> 13:46.827
Nobody. Don't worry about him.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.882
Not the phone.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.011
Okay.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.520
£20,000. I hope that's why you're here.

14:13.604 --> 14:17.149
I've got what I owe and more.
And a shopping list.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.258
He says he has the money he owes in full.

14:43.342 --> 14:47.429
He also wants five UK passports
with American ESTAs.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.598
Plus clean cash in sterling and dollars.

14:51.183 --> 14:55.437
I'll also take a tracker if you have one.
And I need it all within the hour.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.733
Told you I'd be back, Masoud.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.152
You fucking scum.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.536
-What are you doing?
-I'm building a farm.

15:10.619 --> 15:11.620
You're--

15:12.871 --> 15:14.748
You know how long
we have to do this, Aadesh,

15:14.831 --> 15:16.250
and you're playing a game.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.169
No. I have to build a farm
to access the marketplace.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.588
What are you talking about?

15:23.006 --> 15:24.007
Okay.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.677
So I'm moving your cash into this game.

15:26.760 --> 15:31.974
I buy in-game credits, then transfer
the account details to someone else,

15:32.057 --> 15:34.643
and they sell those credits online
for clean money.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.646
But first, I have to build a farm.

15:39.898 --> 15:43.193
I'm guessing that what you're doing
right now isn't legal.

15:44.444 --> 15:49.157
Natalie, every minute that we stay
on this train, the less innocent we are.

15:49.741 --> 15:53.161
You understand that, right?
We're gettin' deeper and deeper in.

15:53.245 --> 15:56.707
Now, there is still a chance
that people may understand

15:56.790 --> 15:59.251
everything we've done until now,
but money laundering?

15:59.960 --> 16:02.171
Going to America? What are we thinking?

16:05.299 --> 16:07.134
Look at who we're trusting.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.637
Eddie's like,
"Sean can't afford to kill you.

16:10.721 --> 16:13.515
You hacked CNPR.
Even you don't know what you know.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.810
You're like R2-D2 in Star Wars
carrying the Princess Leia hologram.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.146
You're too valuable to kill."
But I don't wanna be valuable.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.856
Not as a droid, anyway.

16:20.939 --> 16:24.651
I want to be a successful businessman.
A father, a husband.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.448
You don't have to decide
about New York yet, Aadesh.

16:30.449 --> 16:33.493
But you do have to get that money to Sean.
Now.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.465
Shit. Signal's dropped out.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.799
Apologies, ladies and gents.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.760
It might be slow-going for a little while.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.180
I'll let you know what's happening
as soon as someone tells me.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.018
Did she make you use the safe word?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.228
Yeah, she did.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.563
Thank you.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.190
-Just gonna grab a cup of tea, okay?
-Okay, yeah.

17:45.274 --> 17:46.400
Come here.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.240
You look… different.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.368
Nope. Bad luck. Still me.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.123
She swears a lot. I like her.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.000
I know. Heather's cool.

18:06.670 --> 18:07.754
You're nervous.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.758
There's stuff everywhere about you.

18:13.302 --> 18:14.344
I know.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.346
Is it true?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.102
Some.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.022
But I'm not gonna tell you
what to believe.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.649
I just don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.653
Photos are shit…

18:32.154 --> 18:33.488
Sorry, what's that?

18:33.572 --> 18:35.908
He's saying he's not sure
it's worth taking the risk.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.659
Extra five thousand…

18:38.994 --> 18:41.955
We need an extra 10,000.
That's 75 in total.

18:42.039 --> 18:45.667
And this time you get nothing
before we get the money. You have it?

18:51.590 --> 18:53.926
-Problem?
-No problem. No.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.595
Just need a few minutes. That's all.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.599
-I've got to go away.
-How long?

19:01.308 --> 19:03.977
I don't know. Hopefully not long.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.229
Where to?

19:06.271 --> 19:10.400
I can't tell you that.
But I want you to remember one thing.

19:10.484 --> 19:13.612
Whatever happens, whatever anybody says…

19:15.697 --> 19:18.575
you're the best thing I ever did,
Daisy Duke.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.203
Just--

19:21.286 --> 19:23.121
Just be yourself. Okay?

19:26.792 --> 19:28.544
There's nothing to be scared of.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.967
I just want you to promise me one thing.
That wherever you go…

19:38.804 --> 19:40.264
you won't bring me back a snow globe.

19:42.641 --> 19:43.642
Okay.

19:48.981 --> 19:49.982
Okay.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.693
I love you so much.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.615
Okay, go back to your friends.
And not a word to your dad.

19:58.699 --> 19:59.700
Okay.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.537
Thank you.

20:26.727 --> 20:27.561
There is no money…

20:27.644 --> 20:28.687
We know he's a liar…

20:28.770 --> 20:30.522
and his face is all over the news!

20:30.606 --> 20:32.316
English lessons still going
well over there, Masoud?

20:33.483 --> 20:35.152
He worries people have seen you come here.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.612
They didn't.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.114
Is there a reward?

20:39.448 --> 20:40.741
Check.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.662
Make them not so easy to recognize.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.665
Wait! Wait! The money's coming, I swear.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.417
Just give us half an hour.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.377
Just give us half an hour.

20:55.589 --> 20:56.590
Ali.

21:02.054 --> 21:03.430
You two follow me.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.815
Wait in here.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.578
Hey, dude, listen, back there I-- I re--

21:27.287 --> 21:29.206
Who the fuck are you?

21:29.289 --> 21:32.209
-I've already told you.
-What kind of a student speaks Iranian?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.877
A languages student.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.587
You said you're studying history.

21:35.671 --> 21:39.216
And my ex was doing oriental studies.
You're hurting me.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.468
Yeah. So your ex made you learn Iranian,
did she?

21:41.552 --> 21:43.554
Yes. It's actually Farsi.

21:43.637 --> 21:45.389
I bought us 30 minutes.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.807
I bought us 30 minutes.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.272
You still not sure
what I bring to the party?

22:01.572 --> 22:03.866
What do you think's
gone wrong with the money?

22:03.949 --> 22:06.577
Maybe she never had it.
Maybe they went to the police.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.787
Gone to-- No,
they wouldn't have done that.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.501
-Still no Wi-Fi?
-Please stop asking me that. Please.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.465
I was thinking…

22:21.842 --> 22:25.012
when we press send, if we do…

22:26.763 --> 22:28.223
he doesn't actually need us, does he?

22:29.850 --> 22:33.353
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry for the delay to your service today.

22:33.437 --> 22:38.483
We will shortly be arriving into London
Paddington, our final destination.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.240
We're back.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.808
Well?

23:11.892 --> 23:13.185
You got my money?

23:13.268 --> 23:15.145
Not yet. It's coming.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.149
Wait! Wait!

23:19.233 --> 23:20.359
Wait, wait, wait! Was that you?

23:20.442 --> 23:21.318
Was that you?

23:22.861 --> 23:23.695
Was that your phone?

23:26.156 --> 23:27.324
Sean, check the phone.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.035
Check the phone.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.292
-It's here.
-Show me.

23:40.796 --> 23:41.797
The money's here.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.974
If you wanna call your ma,
they'll have a burner you can use.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.225
Just keep it short, all right?

23:57.104 --> 23:58.397
One more thing.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.317
There's a car parked a few streets away.
I need to trade it for something smaller.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.823
If you see
something that doesn't look right,

24:07.906 --> 24:09.241
speak to a member of staff

24:09.324 --> 24:14.246
or call the British Transport Police
on 61016.

24:14.329 --> 24:17.165
See it, say it, sorted.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.212
We apologize
for the disruption caused today

24:22.296 --> 24:24.506
by technical issues
with our departure boards.

24:24.590 --> 24:27.176
Please listen for further announcements.

24:27.259 --> 24:32.055
On behalf of Network Rail, we'd like to
apologize for any inconvenience caused.

25:18.352 --> 25:19.728
Jump on.

25:24.399 --> 25:25.817
Yep.

25:33.450 --> 25:35.869
-Any news on Cresswell?
-Nothing on his current whereabouts.

25:37.538 --> 25:40.040
But we've had multiple possible sightings
of Chopra and McAllister,

25:40.123 --> 25:41.333
but nothing confirmed.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.543
Uniform are checking them all.

25:42.626 --> 25:44.753
-And Tilson and the car?
-Nothing yet.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.421
-Ma'am?
-Yeah?

25:46.505 --> 25:49.716
-Lydia Thompson is in reception.
-She's been informed, right?

25:50.551 --> 25:52.803
She wants to hear it from you.
Says it's your responsibility.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.225
-We're kind of busy right now.
-Is that what I should tell her?

26:10.445 --> 26:11.572
Hello?

26:12.072 --> 26:14.074
Joe, it's me.

26:15.534 --> 26:16.702
All right, I know you say

26:16.785 --> 26:20.205
that I never listen, but by law,

26:20.289 --> 26:23.333
my legal representative's calls
can't be intercepted, can they?

26:24.001 --> 26:25.127
That's right.

26:26.170 --> 26:29.506
Okay. I need you to tell Mum

26:29.590 --> 26:31.800
to meet me at Dad's place in half an hour.

26:32.384 --> 26:36.263
Please, Joe. I'll never ask you
for anything again, I promise.

26:37.598 --> 26:38.849
I'm sorry.

27:00.454 --> 27:04.458
So when the thieves all left, Ali Baba…

27:04.541 --> 27:08.462
So very slowly,
Ali Baba went towards the cave.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.174
But the door wouldn't move.

27:12.257 --> 27:15.010
He tried to move it himself with
his hands, but it just would not move.

27:17.262 --> 27:20.682
The magic words.
The magic words were, "open sesame."

27:22.392 --> 27:25.938
And he had to walk really, really slowly
because…

27:28.148 --> 27:30.275
it was so, so dark.

27:30.359 --> 27:33.028
He had to be careful and walk slowly…

27:35.447 --> 27:37.407
-You can't be here.
-I had to see you.

27:37.491 --> 27:41.828
I'm lucky to still have this job.
They're watching all of us.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.706
Even the NCA won't know it's library day.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.959
I'm getting all sorts of people
calling me.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.003
Is that why you stopped using my name?

27:54.925 --> 27:58.720
Aadesh, you don't even look like you.

27:59.304 --> 28:00.430
Listen.

28:01.807 --> 28:04.184
Whatever comes out of this,
I want you to know.

28:06.812 --> 28:09.439
I need you to know.

28:11.567 --> 28:13.068
This isn't a lie.

28:14.403 --> 28:17.322
Me and you.
This was always real. It still is.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.159
I'm still me, Son.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.287
I'm still me.

28:23.787 --> 28:24.997
And I still love you.

28:30.252 --> 28:33.005
This is the part where
you say that you love me too.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.466
And that we should run away together.
Right now.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.347
I believed in you, Aadesh.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.600
And I loved you.

28:47.352 --> 28:48.770
I don't believe anymore.

29:58.507 --> 30:01.009
I'm sure she's safe.
They'll be picking her up right now.

30:21.989 --> 30:25.868
Mrs. Thompson, apologies
for keeping you waiting so long.

30:27.202 --> 30:28.912
Joe said you might have found Natalie?

30:30.038 --> 30:33.750
Sorry, but no.
No, we're still trying to locate her.

30:38.422 --> 30:40.424
I'm so sorry about Monique.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.176
We both are.

30:54.104 --> 30:55.689
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

30:55.772 --> 30:59.526
If we both go, she'll think we're worried.
I'll be fine.

31:05.199 --> 31:10.746
Tell the truth!
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

31:46.114 --> 31:47.282
Amy.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.744
New York traffic. Sorry.

31:51.286 --> 31:54.540
Under the circumstances,
I'm grateful for any time at all.

31:54.623 --> 31:58.627
I always have time for you.
It's good to see a friendly face.

32:06.218 --> 32:08.053
I've got three plus the stepchildren,

32:08.136 --> 32:10.264
and I can't imagine
what you're going through right now.

32:10.347 --> 32:12.975
The last thing I wanna do
is put more pressure on you.

32:13.058 --> 32:16.144
-But you're concerned. I understand.
-You know Daddy's not a well man.

32:16.228 --> 32:18.438
You know how fond of him I am.

32:18.522 --> 32:22.568
I don't mean to sound presumptuous,
but I've always felt protective of him.

32:22.651 --> 32:23.652
Of both of you.

32:25.028 --> 32:27.030
I used to be jealous of you.

32:27.781 --> 32:30.409
I thought you were the daughter
Daddy wished he'd had.

32:30.492 --> 32:33.453
I happen to know
Charlie couldn't be prouder of you.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.707
You know, I hear CEOs all the time
comparing their job

32:36.790 --> 32:38.375
to turning around an oil tanker.

32:38.458 --> 32:42.254
And there you are,
literally doing just that.

32:43.088 --> 32:45.215
But you're the one who knows
where the bodies are buried.

32:47.551 --> 32:50.262
I really hoped this was about
the ambassadorship.

32:50.345 --> 32:51.638
Who's Eric Cresswell?

32:51.722 --> 32:53.182
I don't have all the answers, Amy.

32:53.265 --> 32:57.477
But you know how bad it could be.
I'm not a little girl anymore.

32:57.978 --> 32:59.730
How much has Charlie told you?

32:59.813 --> 33:02.274
When I took over IOP Energy,
Daddy was clear

33:02.357 --> 33:05.652
he'd only tell me what I needed to know
to take the business forward.

33:05.736 --> 33:08.655
That way we could maintain
plausible deniability.

33:09.489 --> 33:11.158
Can't think where he got that advice.

33:12.993 --> 33:15.746
I know enough to know that the truth
can't be allowed to come out

33:15.829 --> 33:17.581
under any circumstances.

33:17.664 --> 33:19.499
Then you know everything there is to know.

33:20.083 --> 33:24.213
I've put my life into shifting this
business to clean energy, Katherine.

33:24.296 --> 33:25.756
Renewables, ethical practice.

33:25.839 --> 33:28.342
We can't afford
to be the bad guys anymore.

33:30.552 --> 33:32.638
Daddy was your first-ever client.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.057
I don't need to be reminded
what I owe him.

33:35.140 --> 33:39.770
And I know how loyal you are,
but I also know what Leo means to you.

33:42.439 --> 33:44.608
Tell Charlie not to worry.

33:45.317 --> 33:48.403
We're gonna find Eric Cresswell and Leo.

33:48.487 --> 33:51.365
We're gonna contain this. It's what we do.

33:53.992 --> 33:55.077
I hope so.

34:06.129 --> 34:08.130
How come you got to choose
where we went shopping?

34:10.175 --> 34:11.385
I look rubbish.

34:15.222 --> 34:17.139
Nat, hey. Nat.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.726
I almost didn't recognize you.

34:19.810 --> 34:21.186
That's the point, innit?

34:23.522 --> 34:25.357
-Where did you go?
-Shopping.

34:26.567 --> 34:27.818
You?

34:28.485 --> 34:29.820
Same.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.822
I wasn't sure you'd show up.

34:33.657 --> 34:36.368
I'm R2-D2. You need me.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.081
-Any sign of Tara?
-No.

34:45.002 --> 34:47.504
All right, since I didn't get any say
in the clothes situation,

34:47.588 --> 34:49.630
can you at least tell me why here?

34:49.715 --> 34:51.550
This park doesn't have
security cameras.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.217
That's why I chose it.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.602
You okay?

35:01.685 --> 35:04.354
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-Did you dump the computer?

35:05.230 --> 35:06.356
Is that all you have to say?

35:07.357 --> 35:09.193
Do you know what he had to do
to get that money?

35:09.276 --> 35:10.986
He built a fucking farm.

35:12.154 --> 35:15.240
I said ten o'clock.
So where's the other one?

35:15.824 --> 35:18.368
Don't know. She got off the train
before we hit London.

35:19.995 --> 35:22.497
Okay, then let's do this quick.
Under the table.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.584
Passports, tickets, cash.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.794
Use it to get a night in a cheap hotel.

35:27.878 --> 35:29.254
Fly separately.

35:29.755 --> 35:32.883
We meet 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
Eastern Standard.

35:34.259 --> 35:36.094
Washington Square Park.

35:36.178 --> 35:37.721
I'm flying via Reykjavik?

35:37.804 --> 35:41.058
We're flying three different
routes, from three different airports.

35:41.141 --> 35:42.643
She's here.

35:43.769 --> 35:46.063
Wow. Do any of you do anything on time?

35:46.146 --> 35:48.524
Tara, where've you been?

35:48.607 --> 35:50.025
You two should go.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.204
Don't tell me, I'm with you.

36:03.497 --> 36:05.290
I need to talk to you.

36:05.374 --> 36:08.001
Go for a walk. Stay in sight.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.925
Black coffee please. What old…

36:15.676 --> 36:17.678
I came to tell you myself
so that you'd believe me

36:17.761 --> 36:19.179
when I say I won't betray you.

36:23.225 --> 36:25.018
I can't go through with this.

36:27.354 --> 36:28.355
How was Daisy?

36:30.691 --> 36:32.943
-You knew I'd go.
-Yeah, I knew you'd all go.

36:33.026 --> 36:34.903
I just wanted to make sure
you were careful.

36:36.947 --> 36:38.574
I thought I could do it.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.660
I thought I was strong enough
to leave her--

36:44.413 --> 36:47.791
When I was seven,
my dad was taken by masked men

36:48.625 --> 36:51.211
who said that he was an informer
for the Brits.

36:52.462 --> 36:54.464
And they gave him a choice.

36:55.465 --> 36:57.259
Admit it, be kneecapped.

36:57.342 --> 36:59.094
Or deny it and die.

37:01.638 --> 37:02.806
He denied it.

37:02.890 --> 37:07.686
I blamed him for that
for a long, long time.

37:09.271 --> 37:11.690
Until I realized that he was
setting an example for me.

37:12.274 --> 37:15.110
When you give a kid that,
you won't need much more.

37:17.696 --> 37:20.824
Even after your ma decides
that she can't carry on.

37:22.784 --> 37:24.119
She killed herself.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.330
What happened to you?

37:26.413 --> 37:28.332
I stayed with my granda.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.585
Till I joined the army, the British Army,

37:31.668 --> 37:33.378
and I got revenge for both of them.

37:35.088 --> 37:38.550
And I set an example of my own.

37:42.012 --> 37:44.556
I also need you
to keep an eye on the student.

37:48.393 --> 37:50.687
I'll buy you some clothes at the airport.
Come on.

38:56.211 --> 38:58.005
-We should get back.
-Yeah.

39:00.632 --> 39:01.633
Thanks.

39:03.802 --> 39:05.429
Hey, where'd you serve?

39:06.180 --> 39:07.598
-Sorry?
-Back at the airfield,

39:07.681 --> 39:08.974
you said you were ex-Forces?

39:10.058 --> 39:13.103
Royal Military Police.
Special Investigative Branch.

39:13.812 --> 39:16.315
I can tell you've had to do that
plenty of times.

39:16.398 --> 39:17.900
You handled that really well.

39:18.817 --> 39:21.278
I used to worry that I'd get
too accustomed to it,

39:22.237 --> 39:23.530
but never do.

39:23.614 --> 39:26.325
Nope. Last time I had to do it
I had to tell a mother

39:26.408 --> 39:28.493
that her twelve-year-old son
was never coming home.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.662
Was that the Denver case?

39:31.872 --> 39:33.874
I read about it before you came.

39:35.792 --> 39:37.586
Well, that explains
why you don't trust me.

39:37.669 --> 39:41.381
-No. No.
-Yeah, it was my fault. We had the guy.

39:42.591 --> 39:44.218
And I let him go.

39:45.219 --> 39:46.345
I'm sorry.

39:46.428 --> 39:49.348
My point is that when I tell you
that Monique's death is not on you,

39:49.431 --> 39:51.308
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

39:54.228 --> 39:56.021
Scott, I need to tell you something.

39:56.939 --> 39:58.148
Sorry.

39:59.650 --> 40:00.776
Aadesh Chopra.

40:03.028 --> 40:06.365
Wow, he did a pretty good job.
But that's definitely him, right?

40:06.448 --> 40:07.533
Yeah.

40:08.158 --> 40:09.535
Stansted.

40:10.035 --> 40:13.038
Well, if he's getting on a plane,
it would make sense they all are.

40:13.830 --> 40:15.374
How do you want to do this?

40:16.959 --> 40:18.293
What?

40:18.377 --> 40:20.170
Mum, I can't really talk,

40:20.254 --> 40:22.965
but I wanted to let you know that
there's no need to worry.

40:23.048 --> 40:24.049
I'm all right.

40:24.967 --> 40:27.469
I'm going away with some friends,
so you might not hear from me for a while.

40:27.553 --> 40:30.055
But I'll be in touch. Trust me. Okay?

40:30.556 --> 40:31.849
I love you. Bye.

40:32.516 --> 40:35.727
That was… Eddie Walker.

40:37.938 --> 40:40.274
Real name Liam McKenna.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.277
We recruited him out of drug squad.

40:44.027 --> 40:47.781
He's got talent but not much experience.
Only done a few bits and pieces so far,

40:47.865 --> 40:50.325
but I think he's perfect for this.

40:50.409 --> 40:52.744
-Almost.
-He's tasked with infiltrating the gang,

40:52.828 --> 40:56.707
finding out which of them is involved
and hopefully taking us to Leo.

40:59.293 --> 41:02.504
You faked it all?
His arrest? Your interview?

41:04.590 --> 41:06.133
And you couldn't trust me with this?

41:06.216 --> 41:08.969
His message arrived around
the same time as Lydia Thompson.

41:10.053 --> 41:12.556
He has a phone, but he's obviously
being closely watched.

41:12.639 --> 41:15.809
In the message he's telling us
that he's in control, that it's working.

41:16.685 --> 41:19.646
But our risk assessment didn't include
international travel.

41:20.147 --> 41:22.316
As soon as they're in the air,
they're out of NCA jurisdiction.

41:23.734 --> 41:25.360
So if we let them through--

41:26.028 --> 41:27.070
If we let them through?

41:27.654 --> 41:29.156
It's gonna have to be your call.

41:33.410 --> 41:37.372
Passports, please. Boarding passes.

41:54.264 --> 41:55.265
Passport.

42:27.464 --> 42:28.799
Okay. Understood.

42:37.891 --> 42:40.310
Okay, wait.
Help me get my pitch straight here.

42:41.019 --> 42:44.773
We've identified four potential
kidnappers, possibly terrorists,

42:45.482 --> 42:48.193
one of whom we know
is a multiple murderer,

42:48.277 --> 42:50.654
who you knowingly let fly out of the UK,

42:50.737 --> 42:52.406
all heading toward US airports.

42:52.489 --> 42:55.200
And our play once they land is,
we let them run.

42:55.784 --> 42:57.870
But I shouldn't worry about it
because you put trackers

42:57.953 --> 43:00.080
in their hand luggage
and we have an asset with them

43:00.163 --> 43:02.708
who has barely a year of field experience

43:02.791 --> 43:05.169
and a cell phone that can be used
as a tracker

43:05.252 --> 43:06.962
as long as it's switched on.

43:07.045 --> 43:08.463
Did I miss anything?

43:09.173 --> 43:12.384
Yes, actually. Tilson for one
will already be suspicious.

43:12.885 --> 43:15.262
Put them under standard surveillance,
and he'll smell it in seconds.

43:15.345 --> 43:18.348
-Scott, help me out here.
-We know there's a risk, sir.

43:18.432 --> 43:20.100
One that ends careers.

43:20.184 --> 43:23.020
But look at the risk that they're taking.
Why go back?

43:23.520 --> 43:26.064
We know they're not dumb,
so there's gotta be a pretty good reason.

43:26.148 --> 43:29.735
Now, we could pick 'em up. Sure.
But that doesn't get us any closer to Leo.

43:29.818 --> 43:30.861
Fuck's sake.

43:30.944 --> 43:34.156
I know New York's a little behind London
in terms of the number of public cameras

43:34.239 --> 43:36.325
we can point at them, but we're
gonna be watching all of them.

43:36.408 --> 43:39.161
And, sir, we need to know
where they're going.

43:58.430 --> 43:59.681
Needed some air.

44:00.933 --> 44:02.267
Yeah, me too.

45:11.503 --> 45:13.714
Two and the easy lay-up for Jamal Brown.

45:13.797 --> 45:15.757
The second time in this half.

45:16.717 --> 45:18.051
Perrosi to Bradley at the top of the key.

45:18.135 --> 45:20.470
Bradley, back to Perrosi.
He's got a man open underneath.

45:20.554 --> 45:23.724
There's a little dish in behind the head.
Slam, no look.

45:23.807 --> 45:25.767
Slam dunk number 14.

45:25.851 --> 45:27.853
Maurice Wilson. Beautiful play.

45:27.936 --> 45:32.274
58-56 Icebergs.
And they dunk the ball again.

45:32.357 --> 45:34.026
Do you want to get in with him or shall I?

45:34.109 --> 45:35.277
He's all yours.

46:22.157 --> 46:23.700
See you in the morning.

46:26.495 --> 46:28.080
Big day tomorrow.

48:11.308 --> 48:12.476
All set?
