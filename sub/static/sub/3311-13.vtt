00:06.607 --> 00:09.377
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.279 --> 00:14.382
HELLO! WHO'S HERE? I GOTTA TELL
SOMEONE ABOUT MY CRAPFEST OF A DAY.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.451
- YOU!
- SORRY, I HAVE NO TIME TO ATTEND CRAPFESTS.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.587
JUST PICK ME UP A
LITTLE T-SHIRT.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.190
THE KIDS ARE FINISHING THEIR DINNER,
THAT MEANS I AM OFF THE CLOCK.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.557
- SO NIGHT.
- HOLD IT.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.593
WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING OFF TO
IN YOUR NEW FANCY MAN-SHIRT?

00:25.626 --> 00:28.996
NEW, NOT FANCY. KEEPING TRACK
OF MY CLOTHES, ARE YOU?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.564
YEAH. YOUR CLOTHES
ARE INTERESTING.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.600
YOU... NOT SO MUCH.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.635
I GOT A DATE, OKAY?
YOU REMEMBER THOSE?

00:34.668 --> 00:36.637
YEAH, I DATE. I DATED RECENTLY.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.407
ALL RIGHT? INTERNET
CHATROOMS COUNT.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.342
IT SUCKS I HAVE NO PRIVACY HERE.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.145
OH HEY, SINCE YOU'RE HERE...

00:44.178 --> 00:47.681
AM I SHOWING OFF A LITTLE TOO
MUCH CLEAVAGE FOR A FIRST DATE?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.683
WOW. WHO IS THIS GIRL?

00:49.717 --> 00:52.353
I MEAN, SHE MUST BE PRETTY SPECIAL
TO GET YOU ALL DUDED UP AND NERVOUS.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.688
I AM NOT NERVOUS. JOE LONGO
NEVER LOSES HIS COOL.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.058
YEAH, OF COURSE. HEY, IS THAT LITTLE
SPAGHETTI SAUCE ON YOUR COLLAR?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.760
WHAT? WHERE?

00:59.793 --> 01:02.163
THAT? THAT WAS JUST... NO, THAT?

01:02.196 --> 01:04.598
I THINK THAT'S JUST A SHADOW FROM MY CHIN.
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW?

01:04.632 --> 01:07.735
- NO, I JUST...
- YOU KNOW, JOE, I KNOW I CAN BE CRITICAL

01:07.768 --> 01:09.703
ABOUT WHAT YOU WEAR
AND WHAT YOU SAY

01:09.737 --> 01:11.572
AND HOW YOU LOAD THE DISHWASHER.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.108
I MEAN, KNIVES FACING UP...
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

01:14.142 --> 01:16.177
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE,

01:16.210 --> 01:19.180
I WILL WITHHOLD JUDGMENT.
NOW WHO IS SHE?

01:19.213 --> 01:22.416
FINE. UM, SEE, IT'S WEIRD
'CAUSE HER AND I...

01:22.450 --> 01:24.685
UH, WELL, WE... IT'S...

01:24.718 --> 01:26.487
TIFFANY.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.590
OH, YOUR EX-WIFE? WELL,
MMM, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.159
MM-HMM. ( chuckles )

01:31.192 --> 01:32.826
ARE YOU INSANE?

01:32.860 --> 01:35.696
I MEAN, SHE'S A LUNATIC. HAVE
YOU LOST YOUR FRIGGIN' MIND?

01:35.729 --> 01:38.532

TIFFANY? THE SAME
TIFFANY WHO MARRIED YOU

02:01.822 --> 02:04.658
AND THEN DUMPED YOUR ASS THE MINUTE
THE GRAVY TRAIN RAN OUT OF GRAVY?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.560
WITH A LITTLE DISTANCE
AND FURTHER REFLECTION,

02:06.594 --> 02:08.729
SHE REALIZED THAT SHE DIDN'T
MISS ALL THAT STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

02:08.762 --> 02:12.633
AND WHAT SHE REALLY MISSED
WAS ALL THIS STUFF.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.368
IT TOOK HER FOUR MONTHS
TO REALIZE THAT?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.337
I MISSED "SEX AND THE CITY"
THE DAY IT WENT OFF THE AIR.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.639
AND THOSE MOVIES
HAVE NOT HELPED.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.641
THIS TIFFANY NOW IS ALL RIGHT?
TIFFANY,

02:20.674 --> 02:22.710
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT I
FELL FOR THREE YEARS AGO

02:22.743 --> 02:25.145
WHEN I SPOTTED HER ACROSS
A CROWDED BROKER BAR.

02:25.179 --> 02:29.317
AW. AND OUT OF ALL THE OTHER
GOLD-DIGGERS, YOU CHOSE HER.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.652
IT'S LIKE A ROMANCE NOVEL.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.821
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THINGS
SLOW AND SEE WHERE THEY GO.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.823
WE'RE GONNA START OUT AS
FRIENDS AND GO FROM THERE.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.326
I APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING
JUST DINNER, SO RELAX.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.428
JUST DINNER? THAT'S LIKE
SAYING IT'S JUST MURDER.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.196
ALL RIGHT? THAT WOMAN IS TOXIC.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.365
I MEAN, WHEN YOU PARTS
START FALLING OFF.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.467
YOU HAD HAIR WHEN
YOU MET HER, RIGHT?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.670
YEAH. WHO KNOWS WHAT
YOU'LL LOSE NEXT?

02:49.703 --> 02:52.540
I THINK I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES
WITH HER, ALL RIGHT?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.442
BUT NOT WITH THIS SHIRT.
I GOTTA CHANGE.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.610
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A
SHIRT MADE OUT OF MONEY.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.878
THAT'LL GET HER ATTENTION.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.248
HEY, NO COMPUTERS
AT THE DINNER TABLE

03:00.281 --> 03:03.817
UNLESS YOU'RE DOING MY
ONLINE TRAFFIC SCHOOL.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.487
WHAT? ISABEL LIPPI
FOR MOST POPULAR.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.888
SHE'S A HORRIBLE PERSON.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.623
HORRIBLE WORKS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.325
PLUS SHE HAS A POOL.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.727
YOU KNOW "THE GREAT RANT"...
THE SCHOOL BLOG?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.729
WELL, THEY'RE DOING A
POLL FOR CLASS FAVORITES.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.632
AW, PLEASE DON'T
DRAW ME INTO THIS.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.835
UNFAIR. I HATE THIS
IS EVIL.PEOPLE.

03:21.869 --> 03:26.206
THE PEOPLE GETTING VOTES FOR BEST
LOOKING AND BEST EYES AND BEST SMILE...

03:26.240 --> 03:28.642
OH, THIS IS NOTHING BUT
A POPULARITY CONTEST.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.779
HONEY, USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE
RUNNING FOR MOST POPULAR,

03:31.812 --> 03:34.715
IT'S A POPULARITY CONTEST.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.285
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CARE WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.420
I WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY
SLAPPING A LABEL ON ME.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.222
OH, TOO LATE, SNOTTY McBOOGER.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.759
I HAD A COLD LAST MONTH. WHY
CAN'T PEOPLE GET OVER THIS?

03:45.793 --> 03:49.863
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THE
BOYS VOTED ME EASIEST...

03:51.665 --> 03:53.834
TO GET ALONG WITH.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.271
WOW... TWO FANCY MAN-SHIRTS.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.839
YEAH, I HAVE MORE
THAN ONE SHIRT.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.242
IT'S REALLY CRAZY DOWN THERE.
IT'S LIKE I'M A ROCK STAR.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.312
WHO'S YOUR DATE WITH?

04:04.345 --> 04:06.447
- UH WELL...
- HIS EX, TIFFANY.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.881
- OH MY GOD.
- JOE, DON'T.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.484
HEY, STOP IT, ALL OF YOU.
ALL RIGHT?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.486
LOOK, I REALIZE IN HASTE
AFTER WE BROKE UP,

04:12.520 --> 04:14.488
I MAY HAVE SAID SOME THINGS
THAT MADE HER SOUND LIKE A...

04:14.522 --> 04:15.656
MONEY-GRUBBING BITCH.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.726
I'M NOT BEING MEAN.
THAT'S THE LEGAL TERM.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.761
I AM CONVINCED THAT IF
YOU ALL MET TIFFANY,

04:20.794 --> 04:22.262
YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR MINDS.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.332
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM
GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.734
OH MY GOSH, I GET TO
MEET MY NANNY'S EX-WIFE?

04:26.767 --> 04:29.537
IT'S THE MOMENT EVERY
GIRL DREAMS OF.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.973
AND YOU WILL FIND THAT SHE IS A
KIND, CARING, GENUINE HUMAN BEING.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.609
HEY, WITH JUST A
TOUCH OF SILICONE.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.346
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
SHE'S 98% GENUINE.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.652
THERE SHE IS, LOOKIN'
AT IT AGAIN.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.654
WELL, LOOK WHO'S
IN THE LEAD NOW.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.956
THERE'S NO WAY ANNETTE RYAN
IS MOST POPULAR ANYTHING...

04:48.989 --> 04:52.693
EXCEPT MAYBE WITH THE
ENTIRE FOOTBALL TEAM.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.662
WHY DO YOU CARE?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.497
I DON'T CARE.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.533
UH-HUH. THOSE ARE THE CLENCHED
FISTS OF SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T CARE.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.735
I COULD GET VOTES
IF I WANTED TO.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.338
YOU KNOW, I COULD BE
BEST HAIR, NICEST SMILE.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.774
I COULD BE SWEETEST, DAMN IT.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.276
WELL, YOU'VE DEFINITELY GOT
A SHOT AT MOST DELUSIONAL.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.612
IT IS NOT THAT
HARD TO WIN THESE.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.047
IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING
ATTENTION AND KISSING UP.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.384
OH, I COULD TOTALLY
TAKE THEM DOWN.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.687
I WOULD BE INCLINED TO SAY
YOU ARE A LOT OF TALK.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.756
AND I'D BE INCLINED TO SAY
SHUT UP AND WATCH ME.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.692
OKAY OKAY, WHICH ONE
ARE YOU GOING FOR?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.560
ALL OF 'EM...

05:26.594 --> 05:28.796
SMARTEST, BEST FRIEND,
MOST COMPASSIONATE.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.433
OH, THE SCHOOL IS GONNA
TREMBLE AT MY GREATNESS.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.503
OR POSSIBLY SHOVE
YOU IN A LOCKER.

05:39.840 --> 05:44.311
OH, "SENIOR CITIZEN RENT
INCREASE EXEMPTION PROPOSAL."

05:44.344 --> 05:47.481
OH GOD, I'M GONNA NEED SOME
OXYGEN TO GET THROUGH THIS ONE.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.684
- ( doorbell rings )
- OH, THANK YOU, WHOEVER YOU ARE.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.055
OH MY GOSH, ARE YOU MEL BURKE?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.857
- TIFFANY?
- UH-HUH.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.393
WOW, SO WE FINALLY GET TO MEET.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.695
I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE
MUCH LESS ATTRACTIVE...

06:01.729 --> 06:04.765
YOU KNOW, HELMET HAIR, SCARF
COVERING UP A BIG CHICKEN NECK.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.735
( laughs ) BUT LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE PRETTY.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.770
I MEAN, NOT ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME WORRY,

06:09.803 --> 06:13.774
BUT A STRONG SIX. GOOD FOR YOU.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.977
WELL, I AM DOUBLE-D-LIGHTED
TO MEET YOU.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.746
COME ON IN.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.047
THANK YOU.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.750
OH, WHERE'S MY JOEJOEBEE?

06:22.783 --> 06:25.085
UH, "JOEJOEBEE"?

06:25.118 --> 06:27.020
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I CALL JOE.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.856
DID HE TELL YOU HIS
PET NAME FOR ME?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.692
ACTUALLY, HE'S CALLED
YOU QUITE A FEW NAMES.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.128
JOE IS JUST DROPPING THE KIDS
OFF AT A BASKETBALL GAME.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.697
HE'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.599
- CAN I GET YOU A GLASS OF WINE?
- NO.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.534
I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T.
I CAN'T BECAUSE,

06:40.568 --> 06:42.736
WELL, NO REASON, JUST NOTHING.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.938
OKAY, I THINK I'M PREGNANT.

06:44.972 --> 06:48.008
OH WOW, BOY, OKAY, THAT WAS
LIKE A BULLET OF TRUTH.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.712
UM... ( laughs ) I
AM UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.046
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.648
IT'S JUST BEEN A FEW DAYS.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.016
I'M LATE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.652
I HAVE READ "OUR
BODIES, OURSELVES."

06:58.686 --> 07:00.854
UM, SO DOES JOE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.790
NO. AND YOU CAN'T TELL HIM.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.792
PLEASE PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T TELL HIM.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.094
PROMISE. PINKY-SWEAR
ON OUR FRIENDSHIP.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.897
- OUR FRIENDSHIP?
- OH, YOU FEEL IT TOO?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.933
OH, IT'S LIKE WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOREVER.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.869
YEAH. IT DOES SEEM THAT WAY.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.439
OH, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.675
NOW I CAN REALLY LET IT ALL OUT.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.977
OH, YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK?

07:24.011 --> 07:27.047
I'VE HAD NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT
THIS SINCE IT'S HAPPENED.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.919
MY BOOBS ARE ALL TENDER AND I
HAVE GAS LIKE A TRUCK DRIVER.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.687
WOW, YOU HAVE BEEN HOLDING BACK.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.489
OKAY, PLEASE CONTINUE TO DO SO.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.158
UM, BUT MAYBE YOU NEED TO
TALK TO JOE ABOUT THIS.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.728
OH, NO NO NO. JOEJOEBEE
AND I JUST RECONNECTED.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.063
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE HIM OFF.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.065
HE'S SUCH A SPECIAL GUY.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.668
AND I'VE DATED A LOT OF GUYS...

07:47.701 --> 07:50.704
A LOT.

07:50.738 --> 07:54.742
LIKE A PARKING LOT?

07:54.775 --> 07:56.810
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?

07:56.844 --> 08:00.013
I THOUGHT I HAD THAT
RHYTHM METHOD DOWN PAT.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.783
YEAH, WELL, SOMETIMES
YOU MISS A BEAT.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.852
BUT LOOK, IF YOU WANT
A FUTURE WITH JOE,

08:04.885 --> 08:06.987
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM ABOUT THIS.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.089
OH NO! I MEAN, NOT
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.959
I CAN HIDE IT UNDER
BIG BULKY CLOTHES.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.595
OH, YOU'LL LEND ME
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

08:14.628 --> 08:19.600
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA CHALK THAT
UP TO YOU NOT THINKING CLEARLY.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.203
OH, WHERE'S MY JOEJOEBEE?
I NEED MY JOEJOEBEE.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.739
OKAY, SWEETIE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO STOP SAYING "JOEJOEBEE,"

08:25.773 --> 08:28.609
'CAUSE IT DOES SOMETHING
TO ME RIGHT HERE.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.779
HEY, MEL, IS... OH, TIFFYPOP!

08:31.812 --> 08:33.847
- JOEJOEBEE.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.818
- SORRY I'M LATE.
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.987
SO WHAT HAVE YOU TWO LADIES
BEEN DOING UP HERE, HUH?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.789
TALKING ABOUT BOYS
AND SHARING SECRETS?

08:41.822 --> 08:44.091
UH, WE'VE BEEN SHARING
AND THERE ARE SECRETS,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.726
BUT NOT FOR LONG. RIGHT, TIFF?

08:45.759 --> 08:48.662
YEAH YEAH. LET'S GO, JOE.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.063
SHE'S KIND OF SWEET, ISN'T SHE?

08:50.097 --> 08:53.266
- COME ON, JOEJOEBEE!

OH, GOOD MORNING.
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.855
YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO HEAR HOW
LAST NIGHT WENT WITH TIFFANY.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.790
OH, IT WENT AMAZING.

09:16.824 --> 09:20.794
REALLY? SO, YOU KNOW, SHE
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

09:20.828 --> 09:24.064
ANYTHING YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING?

09:24.097 --> 09:27.000
ACTUALLY SHE DID. SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
THINKING ABOUT GOING TO NURSING SCHOOL.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.669
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

09:28.702 --> 09:32.840
NURSING, YEAH, THAT... THAT...
SHE COULD BE GOOD AT THAT.

09:34.975 --> 09:38.712
ALL RIGHT, NO MORE eBAY FOR YOU.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.880
THANK YOU.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.616
TODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF VOTING,
SO I'M GOING FOR BROKE.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.285
I'M GONNA TRY TO TAKE MOST
DRAMATIC, MOST STYLISH,

09:45.318 --> 09:46.887
AND THE BIGGEST FLIRT.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.822
THROW IN "MOST LIKELY
NOT TO PAY FOR DINNER,"

09:48.856 --> 09:50.590
AND YOU GOT THE TYPICAL GIRL.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.992
OH, COME ON, YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.896
AND I HAVE A SECRET
WEAPON FOR MOST DRAMATIC.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.699
LENNOX?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.802
FAKE FAINT.

10:01.835 --> 10:05.706
HUH? HUH? NOW THAT
IS SOME DRAMA.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.877
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GONNA
WORK ITSELF OUT, I HOPE.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.680
I MEAN, THERE'S A SCHOOL
COUNSELOR, RIGHT?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.314
ALL RIGHT, SPEAKING OF
DRAMA, JUST CURIOUS...

10:14.347 --> 10:17.084
TIFFANY DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING
WE TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.919
AS HARD AS THIS MAY BE
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.788
WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT YOU.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.891
JOE, I TOLD YOU I HAVE TO BE AT
SCHOOL 45 MINUTES EARLY TODAY, RIGHT?

10:23.924 --> 10:27.627
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- I WROTE IT DOWN.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.730
HOW COULD I NOT SEE THAT?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.999
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE.
- JOE, I JUST...

10:32.032 --> 10:34.067
I CAN'T. I GOTTA GET HIM TO SCHOOL.
CAN IT WAIT?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.103
YEAH, IT CAN WAIT.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.643
MEL, THE ANTI-CRUISING
POLICE DETAIL IN THE PARK

10:43.677 --> 10:45.913
WAS JUST CAUGHT
CRUISING IN THE PARK.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.248
THE PRESS WANT A STATEMENT.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.051
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
DO YOU HATE ME?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.886
STEPH, SIT. I NEED SOME ADVICE.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.223
FROM... FROM... FROM ME?

10:57.925 --> 10:59.893
OKAY.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.329
ALL RIGHT, GIRL TO GIRL,
IT'S ABOUT A PREGNANCY.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.397
OH MY GOD! YOU'RE PREGNANT? HOW?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.900
I MEAN WHY? I MEAN YIKES.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.902
AN UNMARRIED PROMISCUOUS
CITY OFFICIAL?

11:08.936 --> 11:10.838
THE PRESS IS GONNA CRUCIFY US.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.007
OH, BUT I THINK A
BABY IS A BLESSING.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.077
WOW, WELL, I THINK A CALM
ASSISTANT IS A BLESSING.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.679
I'M NOT PREGNANT.
IT'S ABOUT A FRIEND.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.849
OH, A "FRIEND," RIGHT.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.984
GOOD. I CAN SPIN THAT.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.886
HOW WOULD YOU BE
ABLE TO SPIN THAT

11:25.919 --> 11:28.789
IF I WERE ACTUALLY PREGNANT AND
I SAID THAT SOME... NEVER MIND.

11:28.822 --> 11:32.292
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL... JOE HAS
STARTED SEEING HIS EX-WIFE AGAIN.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.262
- ( gasps )
- MY REACTION EXACTLY BUT WITH BOTH HANDS.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.397
YEAH, SO SHE COMES OVER
WHEN JOE'S NOT HOME

11:37.430 --> 11:39.967
SO I CAN SEE WHAT A NICE PIECE
OF PSYCHOTIC WORK SHE IS.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.803
AND THEN SHE BLURTS OUT THAT SHE'S
PREGNANT AND I CAN'T TELL JOE.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.005
BUT HE DESERVES TO KNOW
THAT HE'S SEEING SOMEONE

11:45.038 --> 11:47.040
WHO'S GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER MAN'S BABY.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.708
WHAT THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.011
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED YOU
BEFORE YOU UNLOADED ALL THIS.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.013
I'M REALLY TERRIBLE
AT GIVING ADVICE.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.082
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE
ABOUT YOUR NEW HAIR COLOR,

11:55.115 --> 11:59.686
- BECAUSE ON THAT...
- OKAY, DIG DEEPER.

11:59.719 --> 12:04.057
MY MOTHER ELAINE IS REALLY GOOD
AT THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.894
SO I THINK THIS IS
WHAT SHE WOULD SAY...

12:08.762 --> 12:12.365
DARLING, I THINK YOU GOT
A THING FOR THIS JOE GUY

12:12.399 --> 12:14.334
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
REALLY BOTHERING YOU.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.805
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
YOUR OWN FEELINGS FIRST

12:17.838 --> 12:20.407
AND THEN TELL HIM WHAT
THAT GIRL TOLD YOU

12:20.440 --> 12:23.977
AND YOU DON'T WANT HIM GETTING
BACK WITH THAT CRAZY HUSSY.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.380
THANKS, STEPHANIE.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.882
OH, DON'T THANK
ME; THANK ELAINE.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.151
YEAH, BUT SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY...

12:31.184 --> 12:33.186
THANKS, ELAINE.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.025
( beeping )

12:38.058 --> 12:40.460
GREAT, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.396
NO, THIS IS NOT A "GREAT,
YOU'RE HOME EARLY."

12:43.430 --> 12:46.033
THIS IS A "YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?"

12:46.066 --> 12:48.869
- THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU.
- ME FIRST.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.104
CHECK OUT THIS LITTLE AWESOME PIECE
OF TECHNOLOGY I JUST GOT US.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.174
NO LONGER WILL I HAVE TO READ A SHOPPING
LIST WRITTEN IN YOUR CHICKEN SCRATCH.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.309
MY CHICKEN SCRATCH? YOURS
LOOKS LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD

12:56.343 --> 12:58.245
USED A BROKEN CRAYON
ON A WET NAPKIN.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.381
WHATEVER. WATCH THIS.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.550
BANANAS.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.956
- "BANANAS."
- HUH?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.891
ISN'T THAT GREAT? IT PRINTS
OUT EVERYTHING YOU SAY.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.425
- GO AHEAD, GIVE IT A TRY.
- NO, JOE, I...

13:12.459 --> 13:14.161
- COME ON, GIVE IT A TRY.
- JOE, I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.163
SAY IT INTO THE MACHINE. SAY IT
INTO THE MACHINE, ALL RIGHT?

13:16.196 --> 13:18.999
TRY IT. BY THE WAY, IT
HELPS IF YOU ENUNCIATE.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.534
TIFFANY GOT KNOCKED
UP BY SOME GUY

13:21.568 --> 13:24.104
AND SHE'S NOT TELLING YOU.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.112
UH-OH.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.315
WHY ARE YOU SAYING "UH-OH"? THE
IRRESPONSIBLE IDIOT WHO GOT HER PREGNANT

13:35.348 --> 13:37.284
SHOULD BE SAYING "UH-OH."

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
UH-OH.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.998
IT'S YOU? YOU'RE THE
FATHER OF TIFFANY'S BABY?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.832
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TAKING IT SLOW?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.501
I THOUGHT IT WAS A
BURGEONING FRIENDSHIP?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.803
IT BURGEONED.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.538
BUT YOUR FIRST DATE
WAS JUST LAST WEEK.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.140
HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE YOU?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.009
YEAH, THAT WAS OUR FIRST DATE,

14:02.042 --> 14:05.112
BUT IT WASN'T TECHNICALLY THE FIRST TIME
WE'D BEEN TOGETHER SINCE WE BROKE UP.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.015
NONE OF THIS IS
MAKING ANY SENSE.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.351
CAN WE TALK IN PRIVATE?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.855
ALL RIGHT, ABOUT A MONTH AGO
TIFFANY CAME BY THE HOUSE.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.557
I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THAT.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.993
NO, IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
YOU WERE OUT SAVING TOLEDO AND ALL.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.229
ANYWAY, SHE CAME BY AND SHE
SAID THAT SHE MISSED ME

14:22.262 --> 14:24.364
AND THAT SHE WAS READY TO TAKE
OUR MARRIAGE VOWS SERIOUSLY.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.400
OH, AND WHAT WERE YOUR VOWS...
"LET'S DO THIS THANG"?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.202
SORRY. GO AHEAD.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.872
LISTENING, NOT JUDGING.
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.574
IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF AMAZING.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.010
I MEAN, HERE I AM, BROKE AND
LIVING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE

14:37.044 --> 14:38.378
AND SHE STILL WANTED
TO BE WITH ME.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.247
I MEAN, THAT'S...
THAT'S LOVE, RIGHT?

14:40.280 --> 14:45.118
SO YOU THINK IT'S TRUE LOVE BECAUSE
YOU HAD A QUICKIE IN THE BASEMENT?

14:45.152 --> 14:47.420
- WE NEVER MADE IT TO THE BASEMENT.
- WHOA, WHERE'D YOU MAKE IT?

14:47.454 --> 14:50.290
- THAT... THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS...
- MY ROOM?

14:50.323 --> 14:51.358
WHAT? NO.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.360
I WOULD NEVER.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.362
PLUS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN WAY
TOO LONG TO GET UP THERE.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
- ANYWAY, THE POINT IS...
- WHERE?

14:57.597 --> 14:59.232
- DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO KNOW WHERE?
- YES.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.334
FINE, ALL RIGHT.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.037
IT HAPPENED, UM...

15:06.173 --> 15:08.275
OH, GROSS ME OUT!

15:08.308 --> 15:10.343
OH MY GOD, YOU JUST
LET ME SIT THERE?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.512
THAT'S NOT EVEN SCOTCHGARDED.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.915
BUT THEN AGAIN, NOTHING WAS
PROTECTED AROUND HERE, WAS IT?

15:15.949 --> 15:18.418
HEY, I AM SORRY, ALL RIGHT? BUT
I GOT A LOT BIGGER PROBLEMS

15:18.451 --> 15:20.387
TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW
THAN DEFLOWERING YOUR SOFA.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.655
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUILDING TRUST.
IS THIS HOW YOU BUILD TRUST?

15:22.689 --> 15:25.025
- WITH HER, NOT WITH YOU.
- DO YOU EVEN GIVE

15:25.058 --> 15:27.427
ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT LIFE WITH
A BABY IS GONNA BE LIKE?

15:27.460 --> 15:30.397
I JUST FOUND OUT FIVE MINUTES AGO!
IT'S STILL SINKING IN.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.365
IT'S DEFINITELY SINKING.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.434
OH GOD, IT JUST SUNK.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.137
( sighs )

15:37.170 --> 15:39.206
HOW COULD I BE SO CARELESS?
HOW COULD I DO THIS?

15:39.239 --> 15:40.673
I MEAN OUR ENTIRE MARRIAGE

15:40.707 --> 15:44.277
I NEVER GAVE HER A PRESENT ONCE
WITHOUT WRAPPING IT FIRST.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.613
ALL RIGHT.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.948
I KNOW.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.986
I KNOW. YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON
WHO DIDN'T MEAN TO SLIP UP.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.954
BUT I DID. I DID, DIDN'T I?

15:54.988 --> 15:57.424
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
REMARRY TIFFANY.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.692
I'M GONNA HAVE TO MOVE OUT
OF HERE AND GET MY OWN PLACE

15:59.726 --> 16:01.328
AND, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY
GET A SECOND JOB.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.363
AND I'LL BE UP ALL
NIGHT CHANGING DIAPERS

16:03.396 --> 16:05.132
SO I'LL HAVE NO TIME AT
ALL TO GO TO THE GYM.

16:05.165 --> 16:09.002
SO ALL THE YEARS THAT I'VE SUNK INTO THIS
BODY ARE GONNA BE COMPLETELY WASTED.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.970
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL TIFFANY
RIGHT NOW AND PROPOSE.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.573
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK THE
ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS MORE TIFFANY.

16:13.606 --> 16:17.244
I THINK THIS IS A TIME
TO BREATHE AND THINK

16:17.277 --> 16:20.147
AND JUST KEEP TIFFANY
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.149
- ( knock at door )
- Tiffany: JOEJOEBEE?

16:22.182 --> 16:25.152
- OH NO.
- TIFFYPOP.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.254
JOEJOEBEE, I HAD TO SEE YOU.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.356
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.425
SWEETIE, IT'S OKAY. MEL
TOLD ME ABOUT THE BABY.

16:32.459 --> 16:36.296
( gasps ) HOW COULD YOU AFTER YOU
PINKY-SWORE ON OUR FRIENDSHIP?

16:36.329 --> 16:39.566
OKAY, WHAT KIND OF LEGAL
CONTRACT IS THIS?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.668
TIFFANY, IT'S OKAY. ALL RIGHT?

16:41.701 --> 16:44.071
I'M... I'M OKAY WITH THIS

16:44.104 --> 16:47.474
AND I AM UP FOR THE CHALLENGE AND
I WILL BE A GREAT GREAT FATHER.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.677
AW! HOW COULD I HAVE
EVER LET YOU GO?

16:50.710 --> 16:54.447
OH, AND BY THE WAY, I GOT MY PERIOD.
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.516
OH, THANK THE INFERNAL GODS.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.652
I MEAN, WHATEVER.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.489
SO, OKAY, SO YOU'RE
NOT PREGNANT,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.357
WHICH MEANS THAT
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

17:04.391 --> 17:09.362
WELL, THIS WHOLE BABY SCARE
GOT ME THINKING ABOUT US,

17:09.396 --> 17:11.498
HOW GREAT WE WERE TOGETHER

17:11.531 --> 17:13.733
AND HOW GREAT WE COULD BE AGAIN.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.735
TELL ME YOU DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.305
I DO SOMETIMES, YEAH.

17:18.338 --> 17:22.309
THERE'S NO PROBLEM BETWEEN US
THAT A BABY COULDN'T SOLVE.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.776
LET'S MAKE A BABY

17:23.810 --> 17:25.612
RIGHT HERE ON OUR LUCKY COUCH.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.514
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA
WHOA WHOA WHOA.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.450
YOU'RE LIKE A BIG
CARNIVAL OF CRAZY.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.152
HOW ABOUT IT, JOEJOEBEE?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.721
JOE... ( hums circus music )

17:34.754 --> 17:37.023
BUT SHE NEEDS ME. SHE NEEDS
ME TO GO TO HER RIGHT NOW

17:37.056 --> 17:38.425
AND WRAP MY BIG STRONG
ARMS AROUND HER.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.294
NO NO NO, SHE NEEDS A STRAITJACKET
WITH BIG STRONG STRAPS AROUND HER.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.697
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO RACE BACK INTO
THIS RELATIONSHIP FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.066
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO A MINUTE

17:47.100 --> 17:49.436
WHILE I GO CALL ONE OF THOSE
CRIME-SCENE-CLEAN-UP CREWS.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.175
LOOK, TIFFANY...

17:55.208 --> 17:57.277
UH UH! TIFFYPOP.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.411
( laughs )

17:58.445 --> 18:01.314
TIFFANY, UM...

18:01.348 --> 18:03.683
ALTHOUGH YOUR OFFER
IS VERY TEMPTING,

18:03.716 --> 18:06.286
HAVING A BABY IS A
REALLY BIG DECISION.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.422
SO I THINK THAT

18:09.456 --> 18:11.491
YOU AND I SHOULD JUST
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

18:11.524 --> 18:14.294
TO THINK ABOUT THIS, YOU
KNOW, IN OUR OWN PLACES,

18:14.327 --> 18:18.265
AND JUST KNOW THAT WE'LL
ALWAYS HAVE THE... THE COUCH.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.833
OH. OKAY SURE.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.770
NO HURRY. BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

18:23.803 --> 18:26.539
I'LL BE OVULATING IN TWO WEEKS.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.508
CALL ME.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.277
I WILL DEFINITELY CONSIDER THAT.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.645
OH, YOU'LL CALL ME.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.287
WOW. SHE IS CRAZY HOT.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.289
YEAH, YOU'RE HALF RIGHT.

18:42.322 --> 18:47.126
I HOPE YOU'RE REALLY NOT SERIOUSLY
GONNA GET BACK INTO THAT WHOLE THING.

18:47.160 --> 18:51.698
I MEAN, YOU DESERVE A
NICE NORMAL SANE WOMAN.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.234
KNOW WHERE I COULD
FIND ONE OF THOSE?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.736
NOT IN MY IMMEDIATE CIRCLE.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.639
HEY, BURKE,

18:59.672 --> 19:01.808
THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.877
YEAH, WELL, NOBODY NEEDS
CHAOS LIKE THAT IN HIS LIFE.

19:04.911 --> 19:08.348
I DON'T KNOW. I SORT OF LIKE A
LITTLE BIT OF CHAOS IN MY LIFE.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.882
THIS WHOLE THING IS YOUR FAULT.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.151
OH, EXCEPT FOR ALL THE
PARTS THAT ARE YOUR FAULT.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.454
I THOUGHT THAT GUY ON TOP
OF YOU WAS A PERVERT.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.357
OKAY, WHEN YOU SAY PERVERT,
I KNOW I CAN'T DUCK IT.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.692
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHO DID THAT TO YOUR EYE?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.528
OH, I'LL TELL YOU. YOU
REMEMBER THIS MORNING

19:21.561 --> 19:23.396
WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS
GONNA FAKE FAINT?

19:23.430 --> 19:27.767
AND YOUR AUNT SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER
TO STOP YOU? MM-HMM YES, GO ON.

19:27.800 --> 19:32.339
WELL, I DID. AND THEN SOME OLD GUY
JUMPED ON TOP OF ME TO GIVE ME C.P.R.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.408
YEAH, I NEVER SAW HER FAINT. I JUST
SAW THIS BIG DUDE ON TOP OF HER

19:35.442 --> 19:37.877
SO I JUMPED ON TOP OF HIM.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.912
HE WAS THE P.E. TEACHER.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.149
MR. CARLSON? HE'S ENORMOUS.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.586
YEAH, AND HE DOESN'T LIKE WHEN
PEOPLE GRAB HIM BY THE WHISTLE.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.289
WELL, YOU SHOULD MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.158
YOU SHOULD THANK ME FOR PULLING
OLD BALD MEN OFF OF YOU.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.160
ALL RIGHT, TAKE THIS
TO THE KITCHEN.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.629
ALL RIGHT? WE NEED TO GET A
STEAK ON THAT EYE IMMEDIATELY.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.698
SO IS THIS ENOUGH CHAOS FOR YOU?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.533
YEAH, IT'LL DO FOR NOW.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.713
- SO HOW'S THE STEAK, MAN?
- IT'S GOOD.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.849
JOE, THIS ISN'T THE SAME ONE I HAD
ON MY EYE FOR THREE HOURS, IS IT?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.686
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO
LIVE ON A BUDGET.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.491
YOU GUYS, LOOK...
I MADE THE LIST.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.692
I MADE THE LIST.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.761
LENNOX SCANLON,
MOST UNPREDICTABLE.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.763
AND WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THIS?

20:30.797 --> 20:33.700
UH YEAH. I MEAN,
I'M ON THE BOARD,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.802
NOT THAT I, YOU KNOW,
CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.737
YEAH, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE THINKS

20:37.770 --> 20:39.806
BECAUSE SHE'S UNPREDICTABLE.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.708
I COULD LEAVE
UPSTAIRS OR I COULD

20:41.741 --> 20:44.644
LEAVE THROUGH THE DOOR.
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.313
AND WE DON'T CARE.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.282
THIS IS NICE, YOU KNOW? WE SHOULD
DO LABELS LIKE THIS IN OUR HOUSE.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.951
UM, FOR INSTANCE, I
WOULD BE BEST HAIR,

20:51.984 --> 20:55.722
BEST AUNT AND BEST PERSONALITY.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.824
WHAT, ON OPPOSITE DAY?

20:57.857 --> 21:00.760
YEAH, WELL, YOU WOULD
GET MOST MATURE... NOT!

21:00.793 --> 21:03.663
RIGHT AFTER YOU GOT LEAST CONSISTENT
ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU EVER SAY.

21:03.696 --> 21:04.897
EH, NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.733
RYDER, DO YOU WANT
TO GO UPSTAIRS?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.368
I CANNOT DEAL WITH ONE
OF THESE RIGHT NOW.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.736
YEAH, ME EITHER.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.538
"NAH NAH NAH NAH."
WHAT WAS THAT?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.473
WHAT ARE YOU, A
ROADRUNNER OR SOMETHING?

21:13.506 --> 21:14.741
YOU WOULD GET MOST ANNOYING.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.709
- OH, I'D GET MOST ANNOYING?
- YEAH.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.846
- REALLY? OKAY, WELL, I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.
- AND MOST BALD.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.883
