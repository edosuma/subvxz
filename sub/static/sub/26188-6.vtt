This programme contains
some strong language

00:11.990 --> 00:13.620
Who pays your bills?

00:14.390 --> 00:15.749
Nice try.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.950
By the way, this phone...

00:20.670 --> 00:21.900
...it's bugged.

00:22.670 --> 00:23.749
By you?

00:23.750 --> 00:25.700
Would I tell you if it was?

00:27.670 --> 00:29.590
Take care, Ms Ashby.

00:56.379 --> 00:57.790
Where am I?

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:33.969 --> 02:35.129
Sorry.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.510
I was, er, in a meeting.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.030
Phone was switched off.

02:45.070 --> 02:46.909
You OK?

02:46.910 --> 02:48.620
Yeah, you know.

02:51.990 --> 02:53.990
I didn't expect you to still be here.

02:54.910 --> 02:56.380
Ah, well.

02:57.350 --> 03:00.269
Those are my absolute favourite.

03:00.270 --> 03:01.949
Any excuse, huh?

03:01.950 --> 03:03.620
In the country, I mean.

03:08.190 --> 03:10.790
I have some things to clear up first.

03:11.038 --> 03:12.158
Such as?

03:13.958 --> 03:15.198
You want to order?

03:16.318 --> 03:18.838
I'm not sure any of this is to my taste.

03:21.878 --> 03:24.157
You have not looked at it.

03:24.158 --> 03:27.518
You were set to go back immediately
after your triumph in Paris.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.237
Yes, I was.

03:30.238 --> 03:32.917
But then suddenly
Patrice Ganimana arrived here

03:32.918 --> 03:35.158
and you decided to stay. Why was that?

03:40.118 --> 03:45.038
Something tells me
you already have an opinion on that.

03:46.198 --> 03:48.918
Tell me about Bibi Mundanzi.

03:50.718 --> 03:52.437
What do you want to know?

03:52.438 --> 03:54.557
You were brought up together?

03:54.558 --> 03:57.597
Yes. My family adopted her.

03:57.598 --> 03:59.998
So, like a sister?

04:01.438 --> 04:03.238
Like that.

04:04.138 --> 04:08.260
And now you want to bring
her down your sister?

04:09.358 --> 04:10.330
Ah.

04:10.355 --> 04:13.324
And you're waiting for the
perfect moment to do it.

04:14.238 --> 04:15.919
You had one in France, but this one,

04:15.920 --> 04:18.438
this looks even better, doesn't it?

04:22.398 --> 04:24.598
At least you're not trying
to tell me I'm wrong.

04:27.158 --> 04:30.037
I am not trying to bring her down.

04:30.038 --> 04:31.078
Then what?

04:32.398 --> 04:33.558
I just...

04:34.798 --> 04:37.837
...I want her to make an adjustment.

04:37.838 --> 04:39.198
To what?

04:40.491 --> 04:42.451
Our constitution.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.838
To stop her running again? Too late.

04:47.598 --> 04:50.197
To ensure others can run against her.

04:50.198 --> 04:51.740
They can already.

04:52.558 --> 04:56.158
No, Kate, they cannot, not really.

04:58.318 --> 04:59.958
So how are you going to do it?

05:02.064 --> 05:03.344
Hmm!

05:08.078 --> 05:11.598
Erm... pick my moment...

05:12.758 --> 05:14.517
...very carefully.

05:14.518 --> 05:16.197
And Michael's helping you to do this?

05:16.198 --> 05:19.597
You are going to have to ask him
about that.

05:19.598 --> 05:22.620
I have. He keeps telling me to wait.

05:24.045 --> 05:27.005
But I've started to figure it all
out by myself.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.198
You want the Ganimana extradition
to fail.

05:32.278 --> 05:34.797
It has nothing to do with him,
not really.

05:34.798 --> 05:36.300
Oh, I think so.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.757
You are waiting for your sister to
look weak

05:39.758 --> 05:43.277
on the same international stage
on which you just looked so strong.

05:43.278 --> 05:44.504
That's your moment, isn't it?

05:44.505 --> 05:45.737
Oh...

05:45.738 --> 05:50.517
It is only... a part of it.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.038
But it's a part.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.300
You don't...

05:59.158 --> 06:00.997
...you don't look too good right
now, though.

06:00.998 --> 06:03.380
No, I, erm...

06:04.038 --> 06:06.077
- ...I don't...
- Did Michael put you up to this?

06:06.078 --> 06:08.117
- Hmm?
- Get you to confess.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.637
No.

06:09.638 --> 06:11.517
So why did you call me?

06:11.518 --> 06:12.558
I did not.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.292
You sent me a text.

06:15.317 --> 06:17.157
Only to say that you were late.

06:29.964 --> 06:32.524
- Do... do not eat it.
- What?

06:32.758 --> 06:35.197
- Don't eat what?
- Did you eat anything?

06:35.198 --> 06:37.317
- No!
- What did you ea...?

06:37.318 --> 06:39.318
Nothing!

06:55.158 --> 06:56.717
Yes!

06:56.718 --> 06:58.477
Hello?

06:58.478 --> 07:00.478
Hello? Hello!

07:30.038 --> 07:32.558
Call an ambulance. Now!

07:40.838 --> 07:43.198
So, so, so...

07:45.238 --> 07:46.958
C'est magnifique!

07:48.998 --> 07:50.078
Isn't it?

07:57.758 --> 07:59.478
Surprisingly, it's pretty good.

08:01.505 --> 08:02.545
How is she?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.164
Ripped out the lining of her stomach.

08:07.345 --> 08:10.545
- You're sure you didn't...?
- No... Michael.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.924
- Why were you so late?
- I was with...

08:18.085 --> 08:19.205
...I was with a friend.

08:20.745 --> 08:21.785
Who?

08:22.958 --> 08:26.398
You think President Mundanzi
runs a one-party state.

08:29.278 --> 08:31.117
De... de facto, yeah.

08:31.118 --> 08:33.638
So how the hell do you think you're
going to change their constitution?

08:37.890 --> 08:39.251
Alice told you.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.380
You didn't tell me you two were lovers.

08:43.198 --> 08:44.477
A long time ago, yeah.

08:44.478 --> 08:46.838
- Don't lie to me, Michael...
- I'm not.

08:47.798 --> 08:50.238
...ever again.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.184
Oh, keep it.

08:53.209 --> 08:54.860
I have copies.

08:58.838 --> 08:59.878
Kate!

09:07.198 --> 09:08.397
Mr Viner?

09:08.398 --> 09:09.957
This is Kate Ashby.

09:09.958 --> 09:12.837
I am so sorry I didn't manage
to get out to you last night.

09:12.838 --> 09:15.637
I was... unavoidably detained.

09:15.638 --> 09:20.078
But if it's OK, I could come now.
I'd really like to see that file.

09:21.358 --> 09:22.718
Thank you.

09:32.198 --> 09:33.878
- The other one first.
- Hm?

09:35.224 --> 09:36.824
That one first!

09:43.038 --> 09:45.998
Hm! It's not exactly Fort Knox.

09:47.104 --> 09:49.104
And what if there was a fire?

09:49.129 --> 09:50.689
There wasn't.

09:51.838 --> 09:53.517
These are people's lives.

09:54.537 --> 09:57.957
You know, the older you get,

09:57.958 --> 10:00.197
the more you realise...

10:00.198 --> 10:02.118
...no-one gives a shit.

10:05.231 --> 10:08.940
There. 2... D.

10:30.051 --> 10:31.651
They're optimistic?

10:31.676 --> 10:32.860
Yes.

10:34.358 --> 10:35.998
Colostomy bag!

10:36.998 --> 10:39.917
Kind of takes the strain out of
things, wouldn't you say?

10:39.918 --> 10:42.598
And guilt-free use of the disability loo.

10:43.758 --> 10:46.700
Except if it was the three of us,
we'd have to stand in line.

10:47.303 --> 10:48.383
You not good?

10:50.978 --> 10:52.940
They're not too happy with my ovaries.

10:53.518 --> 10:57.038
Me neither. Got me a 30-year-old
still living at home.

10:58.011 --> 10:59.411
You don't have kids, Eunice.

11:01.758 --> 11:05.558
Two things, never let the truth
get in the way of a good gag,

11:06.268 --> 11:08.678
and yet another reason to hate my
ovaries.

11:13.398 --> 11:14.638
You're right.

11:18.558 --> 11:19.958
About Kate.

11:21.718 --> 11:23.020
Let her go to Rwanda.

11:23.365 --> 11:26.085
It'll raise her profile over there
and that's what we need.

11:27.892 --> 11:29.020
Good.

11:29.878 --> 11:31.878
But she can't be out there alone.

11:33.012 --> 11:34.812
She won't want to go with me.

11:35.878 --> 11:37.278
She doesn't need you, Mikey.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.478
I've got someone else.

11:41.758 --> 11:43.260
He's been with her for a while.

11:53.198 --> 11:54.518
Shit.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.278
Pick her up.

12:09.998 --> 12:11.758
And you're sure that's everything?

12:11.783 --> 12:14.823
No, those are just the headlines.

12:14.848 --> 12:16.648
The bulk of the files will be

12:16.673 --> 12:19.593
- where those headlines say they are.
- Hm.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.957
- In the UK?
- No, no.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.077
Your mother did it for the ICTR,

12:24.078 --> 12:27.038
- so I guess they'll be in Arusha.
- PHONE RINGS:

12:28.652 --> 12:31.132
Tanzania.

12:31.157 --> 12:32.877
That's where the trials were held.

12:33.238 --> 12:36.677
There's no guarantee they won't
have been destroyed either.

12:36.678 --> 12:39.269
The case never made it to an indictment.

12:39.269 --> 12:40.788
Why was that?

12:40.789 --> 12:42.788
Good question.

12:42.789 --> 12:44.908
Which only your mother could answer.

12:46.549 --> 12:48.220
You'll need to sign for it.

12:49.149 --> 12:51.349
Strict protocol.

13:11.949 --> 13:13.988
I liked your mother.

13:13.989 --> 13:15.589
She was strong.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.615
Too strong, maybe.

13:18.869 --> 13:20.260
Why?

13:20.789 --> 13:26.428
Well, storms come, weeds bend, oaks fall.

13:26.429 --> 13:28.309
Bit of country lore there, ol' timer?

13:29.629 --> 13:32.228
Whatever it is, young lady,

13:32.229 --> 13:34.700
I'm guessing it's what killed your
mother.

13:35.389 --> 13:38.229
You just be sure it doesn't do the
same to you.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.669
Are you expecting someone?

13:51.669 --> 13:53.428
Milkman.

13:53.429 --> 13:54.669
Too fast for a milkman.

13:55.949 --> 13:57.908
Do you have another way out?

13:57.909 --> 13:59.269
KNOCK ON DOOR:

14:10.069 --> 14:11.229
Hi.

14:13.109 --> 14:14.549
Kate Ashby.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.416
Can I speak with her?

14:19.629 --> 14:20.989
Not here.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.349
It's one way in and one way out.

14:35.789 --> 14:37.709
If you give me no choice.

14:44.789 --> 14:47.620
We just going to stand here all day
till you fall over?

14:48.589 --> 14:50.229
No need.

14:59.389 --> 15:00.549
Shit!

16:55.549 --> 16:57.829
Yes! Yes!

17:28.348 --> 17:30.868
Agh! Agh!

17:30.869 --> 17:32.268
Fuck!

17:32.269 --> 17:34.229
Shit! Shit!

17:37.389 --> 17:38.589
Fuck!

18:03.789 --> 18:05.868
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?
- You bugged it.

18:05.869 --> 18:07.504
- What?
- When you put your number in my phone,

18:07.529 --> 18:08.788
- you bugged it.
- No!

18:08.789 --> 18:10.389
How else did you know I was here?

18:11.389 --> 18:12.428
Because I knew you would not call.

18:12.429 --> 18:14.668
So why are you wondering
why I didn't answer?

18:14.669 --> 18:17.388
- Cos I could've killed him!
- Yes! Yes, you could!

18:17.389 --> 18:19.388
You saw him first.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.668
- Huh?!
- So?

18:20.669 --> 18:22.509
So why didn't you pick up the phone?!

18:23.509 --> 18:26.628
How...? How can I begin
to even get the logic of that?!

18:26.629 --> 18:29.388
- Excuse me...
- No! No! Not now!

18:29.389 --> 18:31.228
You are lucky to be alive!

18:31.229 --> 18:32.468
Where are you going?

18:32.469 --> 18:34.268
Oh, that's right, now you haven't
got a phone to follow.

18:34.269 --> 18:35.588
I am trying to help you!

18:35.589 --> 18:37.068
Oh? Really?

18:37.069 --> 18:39.909
By flattening Lance Armstrong here?
Thank you for that!

18:40.949 --> 18:42.588
What's in the box?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.149
You wish.

18:45.229 --> 18:46.709
He tell you where to take it?

18:47.709 --> 18:48.860
Who?

18:49.509 --> 18:51.629
David Runihura.

18:55.749 --> 18:56.989
Who do you work for?

18:59.829 --> 19:00.908
You.

19:00.909 --> 19:03.588
No. Eunice Clayton.

19:03.589 --> 19:05.029
- Eunice?
- Mm.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.828
You work for the Americans?

19:08.829 --> 19:10.948
I work for Eunice, who happens to be one.

19:10.949 --> 19:13.228
And an Assistant Secretary,
State Department.

19:13.229 --> 19:15.629
I do not work for them, just her.

19:16.869 --> 19:18.068
You knew about this?

19:18.069 --> 19:19.308
Just today.

19:19.309 --> 19:20.540
Why'd she want it?

19:21.429 --> 19:22.748
Well, after what happened to Alice.

19:22.749 --> 19:24.628
No, he'd been on me long before that.

19:24.629 --> 19:26.189
Since your mother got killed.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.628
You gave me that priest, his photo,

19:31.629 --> 19:33.188
in the catacombs.

19:33.189 --> 19:34.428
Did Eunice know about that?

19:34.429 --> 19:35.749
Yeah.

19:37.869 --> 19:39.628
- Did you?
- No.

19:39.629 --> 19:43.948
Right, so we've both been screwed
over. How does that make you feel?!

19:43.949 --> 19:45.900
Beginning to get used to it.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.109
Some of the things...

19:49.149 --> 19:52.188
- ...I do, methods I use, are...
- Illegal.

19:52.189 --> 19:53.228
Tell me about it!

19:53.229 --> 19:54.588
Well, that's the thing,
Eunice didn't want to.

19:54.589 --> 19:56.588
What's it to do with her?

19:56.589 --> 19:58.588
You know that photo that Alice gave you?

19:58.589 --> 20:02.308
Of her and Eve and me and Ed
from all those years ago?

20:02.309 --> 20:04.140
Eunice took it.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.789
She and Ed worked at the same NGO.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.788
Oh.

20:11.789 --> 20:13.588
She wants to keep you safe.

20:13.589 --> 20:16.428
Not me, Alice Munezero.

20:16.429 --> 20:18.508
- Both.
- Bullshit!

20:18.509 --> 20:20.588
Your employer is backing Alice Munezero

20:20.589 --> 20:22.189
to topple a sitting president!

20:24.189 --> 20:25.509
Give us a minute.

20:30.269 --> 20:31.749
MICHAEL CLEARS HIS THROAT:

20:36.389 --> 20:39.468
- I know how this looks.
- Yeah, me too.

20:39.469 --> 20:42.188
You lot go to secret meetings
with your trouser legs rolled up.

20:42.189 --> 20:44.148
Alice isn't looking to topple Mundanzi.

20:44.149 --> 20:45.880
Just to change the constitution.

20:45.905 --> 20:48.188
Yes, I know, we've had this conversation.

20:48.213 --> 20:51.628
The only way she can do that
is to make Mundanzi look weak.

20:51.629 --> 20:54.548
And the best way to make her look
weak is to make sure

20:54.549 --> 20:57.068
Patrice Ganimana is not extradited.

20:57.069 --> 20:58.428
No.

20:58.429 --> 21:02.148
So why didn't you give Runihura
that file?

21:02.149 --> 21:04.189
- It was a mistake.
- How many more?

21:05.549 --> 21:07.428
Fingers of my left hand,

21:07.429 --> 21:09.349
not including the thumb, it stops there.

21:13.169 --> 21:15.009
You should go to Rwanda.

21:16.829 --> 21:19.228
What, just to prove you right?

21:19.229 --> 21:20.280
Well, like I said,

21:20.305 --> 21:23.228
I'm not sure the Rwandan
judiciary has the capability

21:23.229 --> 21:24.456
of trying a case like this,

21:24.457 --> 21:28.628
but if they do,
Ganimana should be extradited,

21:28.629 --> 21:30.269
and I want to help.

21:33.035 --> 21:34.315
Why?

21:34.340 --> 21:35.900
We all make mistakes, Kate.

21:35.925 --> 21:38.700
Even you.
You were wrong about your mother.

21:39.509 --> 21:42.540
She wanted to pursue Ganimana
just as much as you do now.

21:43.509 --> 21:45.148
So why did she stop?

21:45.149 --> 21:47.072
Why anyone does.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.588
When there's no chance of success.

21:49.589 --> 21:53.108
Well, there is now.

21:53.109 --> 21:55.309
And if there is, I want to help...

21:56.402 --> 21:57.522
...but on one condition.

22:01.629 --> 22:03.828
A Yankee spy?! No fucking way.

22:03.829 --> 22:07.508
Actually, I was born in Rwanda,
just like you.

22:07.509 --> 22:10.348
I don't actually know where I was
born, thank you very much.

22:10.349 --> 22:12.149
Ah, hence the weird accent.

22:16.349 --> 22:18.589
- They'll know what you are.
- So what?

22:20.149 --> 22:22.268
Whatever it is they don't want
being known,

22:22.269 --> 22:24.308
they're not going to tell you,
whether I'm there or not.

22:24.309 --> 22:27.068
They're not going to tell me anything
with some killer by my side.

22:27.069 --> 22:28.789
Who says I'm a killer?

22:30.335 --> 22:31.655
Something in your eye.

22:35.829 --> 22:37.509
You want to know the truth?

22:40.869 --> 22:43.629
I'm coming whether you like it or not,

22:44.340 --> 22:47.629
so do yourself a favour,
at least let me carry that box.

23:32.749 --> 23:34.748
This your first time here, since...?

23:34.749 --> 23:37.869
You mean you don't already
know the answer to that?

23:40.789 --> 23:41.908
Yeah, it is.

23:41.909 --> 23:43.349
"Yeah, it is."

23:45.715 --> 23:46.955
Me too.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.829
You know, you haven't
even asked me my name.

23:57.229 --> 23:58.660
Florence.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.748
F-Florence?!

24:00.749 --> 24:02.388
No.

24:02.389 --> 24:04.148
Florence.

24:04.149 --> 24:05.189
Oh?

24:06.349 --> 24:07.908
You got a problem with that?

24:07.909 --> 24:10.669
Baby, I've got a problem with everything.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.469
Florence Karamera.

24:21.909 --> 24:23.949
Florence Karamera.

24:25.029 --> 24:27.388
- So strange.
- What is?

24:27.389 --> 24:29.668
To hear my name.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.268
What, since they gave it to you
at spy school?

24:32.269 --> 24:33.629
Out loud.

24:35.629 --> 24:36.789
Here.

24:38.675 --> 24:40.795
Since I was a little boy.

24:41.949 --> 24:43.549
Never thought I'd come back.

24:45.789 --> 24:47.469
But here I am.

25:06.469 --> 25:08.188
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

25:08.189 --> 25:10.468
Stop! Stop the car!

25:45.709 --> 25:47.509
Sorry.

25:49.029 --> 25:50.909
- OK?
- Hmm?

25:52.229 --> 25:53.269
Yeah.

25:54.949 --> 25:56.269
Your dress.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.028
Are you well?

26:13.029 --> 26:14.588
I'm fine now, thank you.

26:14.589 --> 26:16.588
It has been a long journey for you.

26:16.589 --> 26:18.869
- But I'm here now.
- Yes.

26:19.869 --> 26:20.980
You are.

26:21.629 --> 26:23.260
Welcome! Please.

26:33.349 --> 26:34.668
This looks new.

26:34.669 --> 26:36.308
It's a copy.

26:36.309 --> 26:39.188
- Not the original?
- No.

26:39.189 --> 26:41.189
But everything in it's been copied
across.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.589
Where is the original?

26:44.909 --> 26:46.348
Safe.

26:46.349 --> 26:48.388
And there is not more?

26:48.389 --> 26:50.108
Apparently, these are just the headlines

26:50.109 --> 26:52.828
but they should indicate
where all the files are.

26:52.829 --> 26:54.348
In the UK?

26:54.349 --> 26:56.908
No. In Arusha, I believe.

26:56.909 --> 27:00.108
Ah! Fine.

27:00.109 --> 27:01.388
Very good.

27:01.389 --> 27:03.500
Excellent! We have everything we need.

27:04.069 --> 27:07.308
Ms Ashby, thank you.

27:07.309 --> 27:10.509
You have done us a huge service.

27:12.340 --> 27:15.020
Monsieur, how are you today?

27:15.829 --> 27:17.629
- You know who he is?
- Yes.

27:18.789 --> 27:20.180
I know.

27:20.669 --> 27:22.620
I've been reading about you.

27:23.069 --> 27:24.628
Oh?

27:24.629 --> 27:26.109
Yes.

27:28.269 --> 27:32.669
And how does it feel to finally
return to the country of your birth?

27:38.509 --> 27:40.940
It's OK, there is no need.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.555
I understand.

27:47.469 --> 27:51.628
So, this is Dirk Schreiber,
an advisor on international crime

27:51.629 --> 27:53.788
working within our prosecution unit.

27:53.789 --> 27:56.828
- He will be the one to show you around.
- Good morning.

27:56.829 --> 28:01.548
Dirk, this is Ms Kate Ashby,
adopted daughter of the famous Eve.

28:01.549 --> 28:05.548
- And this is...
- Florence Karamera. I'm...

28:05.549 --> 28:07.669
He is here to watch over us.

28:08.749 --> 28:11.988
So, I am Dirk Schreiber.

28:11.989 --> 28:15.069
As is my name, so is my job.

28:19.549 --> 28:21.068
Yeah.

28:21.069 --> 28:23.188
So, come, please,

28:23.189 --> 28:26.709
it is my duty now
to show you Rwandan justice.

28:32.349 --> 28:35.348
I am employed entirely
by the German government.

28:35.349 --> 28:39.868
Before that, I was at the ICC
for seven years as an investigator.

28:39.869 --> 28:44.428
Now it is my job to offer
an expert opinion on the ability

28:44.429 --> 28:48.588
of the domestic system here
to prosecute international crime

28:48.589 --> 28:50.709
for whomsoever makes the request.

28:52.268 --> 28:55.940
- And what's your view?
- For you to see things for yourself.

28:57.829 --> 28:59.309
The President.

29:09.909 --> 29:11.188
Who's that?

29:11.189 --> 29:13.380
I'm not informed, I'm sorry.

29:15.189 --> 29:16.549
I know him.

29:22.029 --> 29:24.389
What she has done for this country.

29:41.909 --> 29:43.708
Allo!

29:43.709 --> 29:45.629
Allo!

29:47.389 --> 29:52.508
Why do you go crazy
every time you're here?

29:52.509 --> 29:55.700
Cos I'm crazy wherever I go!

29:59.429 --> 30:01.708
Saw it in Lie-chester Square.

30:01.709 --> 30:04.268
Got the taxi to stop and everything.

30:04.269 --> 30:06.429
And why do you always take taxis?

30:07.869 --> 30:09.788
Ah! Hmm?

30:09.789 --> 30:13.349
Because I'm married to a national hero!

30:16.109 --> 30:17.229
Ah!

30:18.429 --> 30:20.420
I had a girlfriend like this once.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.508
This one's more lively, though.
Hee! Di-di-doo!

30:23.509 --> 30:27.029
Maybe because you have
your hand stuck up its arse.

30:28.549 --> 30:29.940
Oh?

30:30.429 --> 30:33.660
No, I tried that on the girlfriend too!

30:34.509 --> 30:36.269
Frank, I'm already ill.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.989
OK.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.828
The doctors say you can come home soon.

30:50.829 --> 30:52.109
Hmm?

30:55.429 --> 30:57.428
Police come up with anything?

30:57.429 --> 30:58.869
No.

31:01.629 --> 31:02.909
You?

31:14.389 --> 31:15.980
I've never lied to you.

31:16.549 --> 31:17.589
You know that.

31:19.389 --> 31:22.180
You have that girlfriend
after we were married?

31:25.975 --> 31:30.900
But only after you decided
to give yourself to your country.

31:32.229 --> 31:33.789
You did pretty well out of it.

31:34.402 --> 31:35.842
Did?

31:37.709 --> 31:38.869
Why the past tense?

31:40.829 --> 31:42.029
I, erm...

31:43.949 --> 31:45.989
...I have something to give you.

31:51.189 --> 31:52.749
Open it.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.789
Do not play it.

32:09.549 --> 32:10.988
What is it?

32:10.989 --> 32:13.149
Something that must be heard...

32:14.789 --> 32:18.540
...that people do not want to hear.

32:20.269 --> 32:22.708
That why they did this?

32:22.709 --> 32:26.980
Take it back. Keep it very, very safe.

32:28.149 --> 32:31.188
And when I finally return,

32:31.189 --> 32:33.300
bring it to me at the airport.

32:34.509 --> 32:37.829
This is real, Frank.

32:40.909 --> 32:45.588
If they look through your accounts,
is everything clean?

32:45.589 --> 32:47.709
I mean everything.

32:54.149 --> 32:55.789
I took that Land Rover.

32:59.389 --> 33:01.749
Then you have to find yourself
some insurance.

33:03.109 --> 33:04.389
What do you mean?

33:07.189 --> 33:10.708
In the accounts of other people?

33:10.709 --> 33:13.029
Oh, Alice!

33:17.309 --> 33:19.629
What's this all about?

33:54.229 --> 33:56.148
Is that what they teach you?

33:56.149 --> 33:57.348
Hmm?

33:57.349 --> 34:00.708
Wear a shirt like that?
Weaken the female defence?

34:00.709 --> 34:02.708
- Will you shut up?
- Hmm?

34:02.709 --> 34:06.189
It's a shirt I have. I did not think
of you when I put it on.

34:07.309 --> 34:11.139
And yet you're here at all,
when I didn't ask you.

34:15.789 --> 34:17.029
Have you ordered?

34:22.228 --> 34:24.629
Apparently, they drank
the pool water here.

34:25.909 --> 34:27.149
Hmm.

34:29.909 --> 34:31.789
Everything around them.

34:33.549 --> 34:34.909
Whistles, pangas.

34:38.228 --> 34:39.589
Pool water.

34:44.309 --> 34:46.659
Tomorrow they want us
to visit the memorials...

34:47.882 --> 34:49.081
Not me.

34:49.829 --> 34:52.228
I'm not going to be a tourist
to my own history.

34:53.309 --> 34:54.708
Hello. What can I get for you?

34:54.708 --> 34:56.748
- Nothing.
- Yet.

34:56.748 --> 34:58.148
Don't answer for me.

34:58.149 --> 34:59.348
Please, take your time.

34:59.349 --> 35:01.309
Yeah, I'll take what I want.

35:03.860 --> 35:07.148
I'm just out of sync, that's all.

35:07.149 --> 35:08.309
Sure.

35:11.549 --> 35:14.469
You probably know more
about my past than I do.

35:15.629 --> 35:18.508
I'm guessing you've been
given a file or some...

35:18.509 --> 35:20.628
- Not really.
- Hmm?

35:20.629 --> 35:22.469
No? Well...

35:24.149 --> 35:25.669
...not much to say.

35:25.922 --> 35:27.282
Then don't.

35:32.669 --> 35:34.660
Bellboy saw me to my room...

35:36.229 --> 35:39.188
...showed me around, was a bit slow,

35:39.189 --> 35:41.268
I gave him a couple of dollars

35:41.269 --> 35:44.028
and as he turns to go, there's this
huge scar

35:44.029 --> 35:45.629
right down the back of his head.

35:48.589 --> 35:50.868
Back home, I'm special.

35:50.869 --> 35:55.069
Here, I'm just one Tutsi
amongst millions.

35:55.489 --> 35:57.849
His story, mine, theirs...

35:59.109 --> 36:03.229
...all individual, but all the same.

36:07.949 --> 36:11.389
So, what's yours?

36:16.429 --> 36:18.428
Nothing you'd want to hear.

36:18.429 --> 36:20.069
Don't tell me what I want to hear.

36:27.149 --> 36:28.629
I'm Hutu.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.309
My father, erm...

36:44.109 --> 36:46.469
I'm not really sure what he was, but...

36:48.815 --> 36:50.735
...he was pretty bad.

36:54.789 --> 36:57.068
Anyway, erm...

36:57.069 --> 37:00.068
...as Mundanzi came in,

37:00.069 --> 37:03.189
we got out, into Zaire, in '94.

37:05.309 --> 37:06.669
Erm...

37:07.829 --> 37:10.860
Sorry, I... I don't really remember,
like you, but...

37:13.389 --> 37:15.509
...three years later they were dead.

37:18.549 --> 37:19.589
That I remember.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.069
Cholera.

37:27.069 --> 37:30.829
I was on my own and that's when things...

37:32.429 --> 37:35.308
You... you were in a camp?

37:35.309 --> 37:37.229
Everyone was in a camp.

37:42.269 --> 37:43.629
No.

37:45.869 --> 37:49.509
I became part of... a militia.

37:51.629 --> 37:53.269
First Congolese War.

37:59.982 --> 38:01.662
How old were you?

38:03.009 --> 38:04.089
Not old enough.

38:09.669 --> 38:12.108
But a few years later, I...

38:12.109 --> 38:13.740
...I got lucky.

38:14.069 --> 38:15.580
I got caught.

38:16.029 --> 38:18.029
I thought they were going to kill me...

38:19.589 --> 38:21.389
...but, er, instead they...

38:22.509 --> 38:26.629
...put me into this educational
programme funded by your Yankees.

38:28.269 --> 38:30.868
And, er, when I was 13,

38:30.869 --> 38:32.868
they shipped me over there.

38:32.869 --> 38:35.869
High school, college, military.

38:38.389 --> 38:42.388
And... now here you are.

38:42.389 --> 38:43.749
Hmm.

38:46.709 --> 38:48.349
What's Eunice to do with it?

38:49.869 --> 38:52.189
She sponsored it... me.

38:53.589 --> 38:56.909
Well, that sounds familiar.

38:58.829 --> 39:00.820
Still the same story, just...

39:01.869 --> 39:03.149
...from the other side.

39:06.229 --> 39:07.660
The wrong side.

39:20.029 --> 39:21.429
It wasn't your fault.

39:37.469 --> 39:39.789
Are you going to help me
with this, erm...?

39:41.709 --> 39:44.109
Are you going to help me
with this report?

39:47.389 --> 39:48.468
Yeah.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.589
Yes? Yeah.

39:52.695 --> 39:53.895
OK.

39:55.789 --> 39:56.829
OK.

39:58.549 --> 40:01.980
I, er, I think I'm ready to order.

40:12.789 --> 40:14.148
- Yo?
- Michael?

40:14.149 --> 40:15.748
Kate!

40:15.749 --> 40:18.020
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

40:19.762 --> 40:22.562
Well, it's been two weeks.
I haven't heard from you.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.187
We've been busy.

40:24.309 --> 40:26.309
And what have you found?

40:27.509 --> 40:30.788
The case construction is organised,
purposeful

40:30.789 --> 40:34.108
and, I'm repeatedly told, unimpeded

40:34.109 --> 40:38.268
by any political intervention
of any sort.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.348
Records are held in paper files,

40:40.349 --> 40:43.348
but are organised, safely kept

40:43.349 --> 40:46.868
and easily accessible
in a unit specifically created

40:46.869 --> 40:48.229
for this purpose.

40:49.149 --> 40:53.828
I have been shown a singular case
file on an Erik Mutsinzi,

40:53.829 --> 40:58.148
an ex-government officer accused
of participation in the genocide,

40:58.149 --> 41:01.029
and whose trial I was given the
opportunity to visit.

41:03.789 --> 41:06.468
Over the last few years,
the law has been updated

41:06.469 --> 41:09.100
to match international standards.

41:09.709 --> 41:11.548
Death penalty's gone,

41:11.549 --> 41:13.588
guarantee of fair trial,

41:13.589 --> 41:15.388
unimpeded choice of defence lawyer,

41:15.389 --> 41:17.268
guarantee of cross-examination,

41:17.269 --> 41:19.668
guarantee of witness protection.

41:19.669 --> 41:23.788
All these appear to be present
and standard.

41:23.789 --> 41:26.068
The central prison is old,

41:26.069 --> 41:28.588
but access to the defence team
and a telephone

41:28.589 --> 41:31.468
is regular and unsurveilled.

41:31.469 --> 41:34.069
I've seen it for myself
and believe it to be true.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.668
There is no evidence,

41:37.669 --> 41:40.468
and none has been suggested
by the prisoners themselves,

41:40.469 --> 41:43.748
of torture or any form of maltreatment.

41:43.749 --> 41:48.028
Now, when you set this in the context
of what these men are accused of,

41:48.029 --> 41:51.708
the level and extent of their injury
to the people of this country,

41:51.709 --> 41:54.148
the State's restraint, professionalism

41:54.149 --> 41:58.068
and even respect for the rights
and wellbeing of these individuals

41:58.069 --> 41:59.829
is nothing short of remarkable.

42:02.549 --> 42:05.308
Listen, I know it's only been a
little while,

42:05.309 --> 42:08.788
but based on the evidence
I've been presented with so far,

42:08.789 --> 42:12.429
Patrice Ganimana could well stand
trial here, in Rwanda.

45:32.549 --> 45:34.509
She's coming.

45:42.229 --> 45:43.700
His birthday.

45:44.589 --> 45:45.948
Hm.

45:45.949 --> 45:47.349
You didn't say.

45:49.829 --> 45:52.260
His first here in many years.

45:53.869 --> 45:54.949
Happy birthday.

45:56.380 --> 45:57.588
Thanks.

45:57.589 --> 46:00.069
Much to celebrate, I think.

46:08.269 --> 46:10.508
KNOCK ON DOOR:

46:10.509 --> 46:12.029
Just there!

46:17.549 --> 46:20.189
You go on down, I'll be there.

46:36.269 --> 46:39.309
I am a friend of Erik Mutsinzi.

46:41.109 --> 46:43.789
The man whose trial you visited.

46:44.989 --> 46:46.188
Right.

46:46.189 --> 46:50.300
The witness you saw giving evidence
against him...

46:50.909 --> 46:52.349
...she was lying.

47:18.949 --> 47:20.509
Answer no more.

47:32.789 --> 47:36.349
Yego, nabikubonera mu kwezi kundi.

47:44.589 --> 47:47.788
Well, that was pointless.

47:47.789 --> 47:49.588
The only reason people talk

47:49.589 --> 47:52.548
is if they're more afraid of you
than the other person.

47:52.549 --> 47:54.269
She's not afraid of you.

47:56.309 --> 47:58.429
Go wait in the bar.

48:27.709 --> 48:30.469
Sit down and listen.

48:39.389 --> 48:41.748
She will withdraw the evidence.

48:41.749 --> 48:43.788
Did you coerce her?

48:43.789 --> 48:46.340
Just went further up the food chain.

48:47.269 --> 48:48.549
Where?

48:49.669 --> 48:52.428
The factory used to be owned
by the Mutsinzi family.

48:52.429 --> 48:55.508
And the new owner is worried
that if he's released,

48:55.509 --> 48:56.988
he'll claim it back.

48:56.989 --> 48:59.297
So, he's got a worker
to testify against him?

48:59.298 --> 49:01.189
Not only her. He did it himself.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.380
Shit.

49:05.180 --> 49:06.388
Perjury.

49:06.389 --> 49:08.829
- Hm, but that's not the problem.
- Then, what is?

49:09.829 --> 49:12.100
The whole community knew he was doing it.

49:14.309 --> 49:16.748
So why didn't the defence counsel
find out?

49:16.749 --> 49:18.188
Exactly.

49:18.189 --> 49:20.229
That's the problem.

49:22.149 --> 49:23.948
I've only just started,

49:23.949 --> 49:26.108
but I doubt if I can catch up.

49:26.109 --> 49:27.148
Why?

49:27.149 --> 49:30.108
Look about you.
I do not have the resources.

49:30.109 --> 49:32.108
It is why the last man left.

49:32.109 --> 49:33.148
Why?

49:33.149 --> 49:35.868
They have changed the way we are paid.

49:35.869 --> 49:37.708
It is now a fixed fee.

49:37.709 --> 49:38.988
So?

49:38.989 --> 49:43.188
When it started,
it was 30,000 francs per hour,

49:43.189 --> 49:46.909
but now it is 15 million, period.

49:47.989 --> 49:49.388
What's that?

49:49.389 --> 49:50.829
About 18,000.

49:54.229 --> 49:56.949
- So?
- It is four years' work at least!

49:58.309 --> 49:59.588
Right.

49:59.589 --> 50:02.269
I can hardly afford to pay for a phone.

50:05.869 --> 50:07.828
Why didn't you say?

50:07.829 --> 50:09.868
They are still being paid.

50:09.869 --> 50:12.388
When you set it in the context
of the average wage here...

50:12.389 --> 50:14.348
This... this isn't the average activity.

50:14.349 --> 50:16.268
It's a job that sits on the world stage.

50:16.269 --> 50:18.388
Do you realise
how expensive that would be?

50:18.389 --> 50:20.188
Do you realise how necessary it is?

50:20.189 --> 50:23.028
You have to understand
how far they have come.

50:23.029 --> 50:24.228
Don't.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.228
Don't infantilise this country!

50:26.229 --> 50:27.588
I'm not.

50:27.589 --> 50:31.149
I'm telling you this country
could not afford what you suggest.

50:33.749 --> 50:36.348
So, this makes me very happy.

50:36.349 --> 50:38.708
So you can prove me wrong?

50:38.709 --> 50:40.789
So I can offer you help!

50:44.949 --> 50:46.468
How?

50:46.469 --> 50:49.948
The extraditing country,
like, say, the UK,

50:49.949 --> 50:51.908
would also agree to foot the bill

50:51.909 --> 50:54.308
for a defence team
of the accused's choice

50:54.309 --> 50:55.629
throughout the trial.

50:56.829 --> 50:58.428
A very interesting idea.

50:58.429 --> 51:00.348
Which you might explore?

51:00.349 --> 51:01.748
We do already have a provision

51:01.749 --> 51:03.948
for Western lawyers
to work within our system.

51:03.949 --> 51:05.988
But not for defence counsels

51:05.989 --> 51:09.468
to be paid for directly
by an extraditing state.

51:09.469 --> 51:11.268
It is just that, wherever possible,

51:11.269 --> 51:14.468
we are looking to cut
our imperial apron strings,

51:14.469 --> 51:16.909
not... tighten them.

51:17.340 --> 51:20.388
Forgive me, but I thought
you wanted to see justice done

51:20.389 --> 51:23.260
and for the whole world to see you do it.

51:24.109 --> 51:26.348
Madam President.

51:26.349 --> 51:30.509
This is Kate Ashby,
the daughter of Eve, the lawyer.

51:30.980 --> 51:33.268
Thank you for everything
that you are doing.

51:33.269 --> 51:35.708
Oh, I'm... I'm not sure I am.

51:35.709 --> 51:37.180
I am sure you are.

51:38.069 --> 51:40.909
- David, in five minutes, yes?
- Of course.

51:42.869 --> 51:44.349
Have you seen the gorillas?

51:48.229 --> 51:51.748
Er, no, I haven't had the time.

51:51.749 --> 51:55.269
Isn't that what you all think we are
here for where you come from?

51:57.469 --> 51:59.428
Erm, I...

51:59.429 --> 52:01.749
To protect the gorillas.

52:04.229 --> 52:06.948
Actually, I was born here.

52:06.949 --> 52:09.388
Oh, yes, I understand.

52:09.389 --> 52:10.988
But now from the UK.

52:10.989 --> 52:12.469
Yes?

52:14.109 --> 52:15.388
Yes.

52:15.389 --> 52:16.828
And in the UK,

52:16.829 --> 52:18.629
have you met your prime minister?

52:22.029 --> 52:23.708
No.

52:23.709 --> 52:26.620
And yet, somehow, you expect to meet me.

52:27.349 --> 52:29.028
Oh, no, I didn't, I just...

52:29.029 --> 52:31.589
Thank you for everything
that you are doing.

52:33.989 --> 52:35.789
Five minutes, David!

52:44.109 --> 52:47.829
She can be a little... spiky.

52:51.509 --> 52:53.788
Perhaps I should not have set that up.

52:53.789 --> 52:55.580
You set that up?

52:55.949 --> 52:57.828
I must go.

52:57.829 --> 53:00.828
But there is one problem.

53:00.829 --> 53:02.348
Your mother's file,

53:02.349 --> 53:03.788
it has been very helpful.

53:03.789 --> 53:06.028
We are managing to locate
everything we need,

53:06.029 --> 53:08.140
except for one article.

53:10.749 --> 53:12.109
This.

53:13.709 --> 53:17.148
That is the number
for a file we cannot find.

53:17.149 --> 53:21.340
When you return to London,
might you perhaps take another look?

53:22.029 --> 53:24.748
Well, I'm not sure where. What is it?

53:24.749 --> 53:27.348
That is what we would like to know.
Please.

53:27.349 --> 53:29.628
What about the funding issue?

53:29.629 --> 53:32.389
Oh, feel free to approach
whomever you wish.

53:33.469 --> 53:34.789
I couldn't do that.

53:35.829 --> 53:38.149
Then, who could?

53:40.269 --> 53:42.428
Can't think the issue of defence funding

53:42.429 --> 53:44.588
hasn't already been discussed.

53:44.589 --> 53:48.508
Only as a pro bono committee through
the Attorney General's office,

53:48.509 --> 53:50.828
and that was before we had
Patrice Ganimana holed up

53:50.829 --> 53:53.788
in a prime bit of London real estate.

53:53.789 --> 53:57.269
So, will you show this to the Minister?

54:00.229 --> 54:04.028
Who opened the doors for you in Rwanda?

54:04.029 --> 54:05.788
David Runihura, Special Advisor...

54:05.789 --> 54:08.829
Yeah, I know who he is, Michael.

54:11.069 --> 54:13.388
You know Rwanda is of particular interest

54:13.389 --> 54:15.108
to the Secretary of State.

54:15.109 --> 54:16.428
- Yes?
- Hm.

54:16.429 --> 54:20.908
He was a junior at the FCO
during the genocide.

54:20.909 --> 54:22.268
It caught him out.

54:22.269 --> 54:23.868
Wasn't exactly alone.

54:23.869 --> 54:25.468
But he's a great admirer

54:25.469 --> 54:28.068
of how the country managed
to pick itself back up.

54:28.069 --> 54:29.628
Who isn't?

54:29.629 --> 54:33.068
I prosecuted one of the first cases
at the ICTR.

54:33.069 --> 54:34.709
Yes, of course.

54:36.549 --> 54:40.828
Actually, we had Eunice Clayton in
here the other day.

54:40.829 --> 54:42.268
Did you?

54:42.269 --> 54:44.988
Didn't realise she had her boots
on the floor, as it were,

54:44.989 --> 54:46.700
during the whole horror of it.

54:47.909 --> 54:49.580
She was with an NGO.

54:50.149 --> 54:51.308
That how you met?

54:51.309 --> 54:52.549
Yeah.

54:55.229 --> 54:58.989
She has a very particular way
of speaking, don't you find?

55:00.749 --> 55:01.869
Direct?

55:03.229 --> 55:04.269
Gynaecological.

55:05.349 --> 55:07.188
In, er, quite some discomfort, actually.

55:07.189 --> 55:09.228
I had to offer her a paracetamol.

55:09.229 --> 55:12.708
Perhaps that's what made her
so ill-humoured.

55:12.709 --> 55:14.908
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Hm.

55:14.909 --> 55:17.668
Well, that and the fact that I'm not sure

55:17.669 --> 55:21.988
she and the Minister
share quite the same... vision

55:21.989 --> 55:23.468
for that region.

55:23.469 --> 55:24.629
Which is?

55:32.571 --> 55:36.708
That Mundanzi went for a third term
is, of course,

55:36.709 --> 55:40.629
a matter of deep regret
for the democratic cause.

55:41.762 --> 55:43.400
However,

55:43.829 --> 55:48.468
after the salutary lessons of Libya,

55:48.469 --> 55:51.548
and with the scorch of burnt wool

55:51.549 --> 55:54.269
still permeating the Minister's wardrobe,

55:54.580 --> 55:58.948
the presence of a strong man, or
woman, of Africa is,

55:58.949 --> 56:00.588
for the time being at least,

56:00.589 --> 56:02.508
felt to be far preferable

56:02.509 --> 56:06.348
to yet another descent
into intertribal insanity.

56:06.349 --> 56:08.148
Which no-one is looking for.

56:08.149 --> 56:09.300
Of course not.

56:10.269 --> 56:12.789
How is Alice Munezero?

56:17.935 --> 56:20.175
She's not looking to topple
the President.

56:21.922 --> 56:22.962
Hm.

56:24.229 --> 56:27.508
Although I applaud your directness,
it is, of course,

56:27.509 --> 56:30.060
quite impossible for me to have
heard what you just said.

56:31.029 --> 56:33.908
Though I'm bound to wonder what it
is, exactly,

56:33.909 --> 56:36.069
this is really about.

56:37.648 --> 56:39.300
Oh, well...

56:40.109 --> 56:41.868
That's simple.

56:41.869 --> 56:43.229
It's about justice.

56:45.709 --> 56:46.788
Really?

56:46.789 --> 56:48.269
Absolutely.

56:50.909 --> 56:51.989
What else?

57:03.869 --> 57:05.709
David Runihura.

57:07.869 --> 57:11.348
You realise he's rumoured
to be the Earl of Leicester

57:11.349 --> 57:13.149
to Mundanzi's Elizabeth?

57:13.500 --> 57:15.020
Yeah.

57:15.669 --> 57:20.389
And with Alice Munezero
as Mary, Queen of Scots,

57:20.740 --> 57:24.589
you might just care to ask yourself,
where does that place you?

57:26.069 --> 57:28.988
Fella named David Rizzio, I believe,

57:28.989 --> 57:33.989
was Mary's chief advisor
and sometime lover.

57:36.029 --> 57:38.269
I'm presuming that didn't end well.

57:41.229 --> 57:45.268
But stabbed 56 times, Mikey,

57:45.269 --> 57:47.749
with a knife that long.

57:48.989 --> 57:52.869
They found almost as many divots
in the floor beneath his body.

57:54.062 --> 57:57.262
Makes you wonder just how much
he must have pissed people off,

57:57.287 --> 57:58.967
doesn't it?

57:59.069 --> 58:01.548
But then, perhaps, people like that

58:01.549 --> 58:03.908
never quite understand

58:03.909 --> 58:06.669
the true nature of their game.

58:09.189 --> 58:10.629
Safe journey.

58:16.909 --> 58:18.709
Fuck you!

58:19.305 --> 58:25.827
