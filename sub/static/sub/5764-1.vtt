Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

00:01.996 --> 00:03.021
What are you doing here?

00:03.021 --> 00:04.421
There is something you need to kwon.

00:04.421 --> 00:05.645
I need your help.

00:05.645 --> 00:07.309
You'v got to find that book.

00:07.309 --> 00:09.776
That book...
It's special.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.661
It shouldn't end up in the wrong hands.

00:11.661 --> 00:13.093
The book is the one come and threat.

00:13.093 --> 00:16.309
I mean, my dreams, the thief.
The book is the key to everything.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.433
The book is always changeing.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.433
New things are written.
Old things are erased.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.885
I know this is about our baby,
I just kown it.

00:22.165 --> 00:25.586
- Will my son be able to do what I do?
- No.

00:26.049 --> 00:29.395
He'll be able to do much,
much more.

00:30.679 --> 00:32.189
I looked at the book last night

00:32.189 --> 00:33.948
And there was something really scary.

00:33.948 --> 00:36.328
September 25th.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.044
My due date.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:12.013 --> 01:13.013
Ok.

01:15.365 --> 01:17.510
You've changed the sheets.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.575
Yeah. It gets dusty.

01:19.575 --> 01:21.300
In one day?

01:22.061 --> 01:24.423
I think you need to
get something to eat.

01:25.369 --> 01:26.389
Ok.

01:27.525 --> 01:30.466
Thank you,
for painting the room again.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.042
You are right, honey.

01:32.042 --> 01:35.239
Bule is better, calmer.

01:35.635 --> 01:37.437
I miss the yellow.

01:37.437 --> 01:40.327
Don't, you're perfect.
It's perfect.

01:40.327 --> 01:41.783
I'm just...

01:42.388 --> 01:44.004
- I'm grumpy. - No.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.431
Moody!
That's what I am.

01:45.431 --> 01:47.614
I am just a big crazy
pregnant moody lady.

01:47.614 --> 01:49.919
- And you have exams.
- It's nothing, it's fine.

01:49.919 --> 01:51.935
No, med school is nothing?

01:51.935 --> 01:53.573
It's huge. Ok!

01:53.573 --> 01:56.280
And then you cooked, and you
exchanged to correct the new one.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.412
So much better. By the way,
I mean you've done such...

01:58.412 --> 02:00.489
you couldn't have got my car fix?

02:00.969 --> 02:02.477
I remember they had to order the part.

02:02.477 --> 02:04.817
Yeah, but did you tell them
that we are stuck in your truck?

02:04.817 --> 02:06.498
Your ancient unreliable truck?

02:06.498 --> 02:08.744
I mean, did you tell them
that this is an emergency?

02:08.744 --> 02:10.531
- What emergency?
- This could be an emergency.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.999
Look, I know that it's your due
that the watchers predicted.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.600
But you're not ganna
have a baby tonight,

02:14.600 --> 02:16.606
'cuz it's after 8.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.273
It's the Book of Changes.

02:18.273 --> 02:20.869
Ok, not the watchers, and it's
been right about everything else.

02:20.869 --> 02:23.744
Ok. Do you really want it
to be right about this.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.712
I wanna be prepared.

02:27.228 --> 02:28.982
- Easy. - I got.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.107
Let's go.

03:14.331 --> 03:15.469
Hi, how are you holding up?

03:15.469 --> 03:18.885
Sixteen laps.
No progress.

03:21.372 --> 03:25.130
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- Yes you can. You have to.

03:27.191 --> 03:29.066
Ok, you're gonna be ok.

03:29.066 --> 03:30.765
Come on!

03:34.279 --> 03:36.725
Hey, honey. The doctor is here.
We should go.

03:38.646 --> 03:40.846
Thank you for not treating
me like I'm crazy.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.730
It's just the feeling,
you know.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.306
Doesn't sound like you're in labor.

03:44.306 --> 03:46.043
But we'll just make
sure everything is ok.

03:46.043 --> 03:47.417
Ok.

03:50.865 --> 03:52.684
Your baby is showing
signs of fetal distress.

03:52.684 --> 03:54.190
We need to move you
to immediate delivery.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.080
Get Dr. Glasson.
Call the OR.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.751
- Jim what's happening?
- They have to get the baby out.

03:57.751 --> 04:00.435
Something's obstructing the
blood supply, could be the cord.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.413
Is it ok?

04:05.413 --> 04:07.394
Is everything ok?

04:08.715 --> 04:10.751
Ok, was it ok? Jim?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.515
You need to do a C-section right now.

04:12.515 --> 04:14.000
You're ganna be ok, Melinda.
I'm gonna be with you.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.920
- I'll be right with you, I promise.
- Jim.

04:24.275 --> 04:27.812
- Jim, I'm scared.
- Honey, I'm right here.

04:29.266 --> 04:30.723
It will be ok.

04:30.723 --> 04:32.403
You'll feel pressure, ok?

04:32.835 --> 04:34.602
You're doing great.
Here we go.

04:35.771 --> 04:38.072
Here he comes.

04:38.072 --> 04:39.691
We got you,
little guy.

04:39.691 --> 04:41.741
It's almost there.

04:41.741 --> 04:42.825
This color is good.

04:55.245 --> 04:56.756
Tell me what's gonna happen.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.467
Is he gonna be ok?

04:58.467 --> 05:00.577
Is he gonna be born this
day like the book said

05:00.577 --> 05:02.257
because that's his fate?

05:02.257 --> 05:03.959
Fate.

05:04.649 --> 05:06.246
You made this happen,

05:06.246 --> 05:07.595
You end the book.

05:07.595 --> 05:09.287
So that's how it works?

05:10.791 --> 05:12.951
Fate and freewill working together?

05:12.951 --> 05:14.499
I hope so,

05:14.499 --> 05:17.618
I'd really like to see your child live.

05:23.399 --> 05:25.295
Ok, we got it,
we got it.

05:25.295 --> 05:27.545
Out at 11:48.

05:27.881 --> 05:30.177
Mel, you're ok,
you are all right.

05:34.831 --> 05:37.159
Hello, buddy.

05:37.159 --> 05:38.939
His color is good.

05:48.663 --> 05:50.943
- He's not breathing.
- He isn't breathing.

05:50.943 --> 05:52.345
Why isn't he breathing?

05:52.345 --> 05:53.773
What do you mean he's not breathing?

05:54.037 --> 05:55.765
It's OK.
It's all right.

05:55.765 --> 05:57.712
What do you mean he's not breathing?
You stay with him.

05:57.712 --> 05:58.961
It's all right.
I will. I will.

06:08.278 --> 06:10.769
- Is... is he OK?
- He'll be OK.

06:10.769 --> 06:12.333
They're giving him breath.

06:13.978 --> 06:14.940
It's OK.

06:16.603 --> 06:18.225
Buddy, come on!

06:23.490 --> 06:25.678
Here we go.

06:31.895 --> 06:34.473
Here's your little boy.

06:39.008 --> 06:42.288
I feel like I've waited my
whole life just to be with you.

06:47.478 --> 06:51.292
Hi, Doctor Chase. You were gone a
really long time. Something wrong?

06:51.292 --> 06:54.386
His Edgar scores are normal.
He's healthy and responsive.

06:54.386 --> 06:56.460
Everything seems to be fine.

06:56.613 --> 06:59.424
Doc, is there anything
you're not telling us?

07:00.349 --> 07:04.156
When we got to him, his pulse was low,
his coloring was blue.

07:04.156 --> 07:07.450
Everything pointed to some kind
of obstruction or distress.

07:07.450 --> 07:09.962
And then,
before he even breathed on his own,

07:09.962 --> 07:11.887
his color flooded back.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.524
I've never seen anything like it.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.202
I think somebody's ready to celebrate.

07:21.202 --> 07:22.590
He wants to nurse.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.355
You are not just somebody.
Your name's Aiden.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.233
Honey, my dad's name.
Are you sure.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.720
Aiden Lucas.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.159
He'll celebrate Sam, too,
you know.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.495
Two people who brought us
this beautiful little life.

07:41.496 --> 07:42.837
Thank you.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.072
- That's normal.
- OK.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.256
Another man's at home

07:56.400 --> 07:58.981
And we are gonna protect you.

07:59.466 --> 08:01.510
We will always protect you.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.200
OK.

08:16.510 --> 08:17.713
Aiden Lucas

08:17.713 --> 08:18.945
just because it's almost your birthday

08:18.945 --> 08:20.589
doesn't mean you can
leave your junk at a pile

08:20.589 --> 08:23.094
- Aiden, listen to your mother.
- OK. OK. I'm coming.

08:24.310 --> 08:26.500
Hey, Aiden,
Slow down.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.352
I want a super huge cake with 5 candles

08:30.353 --> 08:32.652
and 5 spoons and plates for 5 cakes.

08:32.652 --> 08:33.974
Well, you've got about five
minutes to play with your dad

08:33.975 --> 08:35.720
before he goes back to the hospital.

08:35.929 --> 08:36.880
Oh, here he comes.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.075
Mom, did you invite dad to my party

08:40.075 --> 08:42.441
and Charlie and Rally and Gus?

08:42.441 --> 08:44.760
Is this what our lives will
become to get the little man?

08:45.170 --> 08:47.101
One giant party?

08:47.820 --> 08:49.038
Yes.

08:50.787 --> 08:52.661
Dad's gonna kill us!
He's gonna kill us!

09:25.460 --> 09:26.350
Melinda.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.861
In the bathroom.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.910
Cross match 2 units of pack cells.

09:32.010 --> 09:33.660
Start an I.V. lining.
Get some oxygen.

09:39.770 --> 09:42.070
Wait a minute,
did you just go to some place or

09:42.670 --> 09:44.974
did some one just come and visit us.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.609
It was a nurse

09:47.110 --> 09:48.210
She was standing right there.

09:48.830 --> 09:51.549
You know, is it me or this is
happening more often these days.

09:51.990 --> 09:54.580
Yeah, I guess in the
last couple of years.

09:54.630 --> 09:57.928
- She was asking for 2 units
of pack cells. - Blood.

09:57.928 --> 10:00.380
Does she have anything to do with a
ghost you're dealing with right now?

10:00.600 --> 10:04.230
- I don't think so.
But it fell from a layer. - Good.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.160
I hope she won't bother
us anymore tonight.

10:06.410 --> 10:09.090
Yeah. Hopefully not.
Did you check on Aiden?

10:09.340 --> 10:10.555
Sound asleep.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.850
Here we go.
Aiden look here is dad.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.598
- Hey daddy.
- Hey birthday boy. How are you doing?

10:17.598 --> 10:20.100
Good to see you, come on,
it's so good to see you.

10:20.210 --> 10:21.130
Can I start to slide you down?

10:21.490 --> 10:24.590
- Daddy. No, not again.
- Yeah, please don't.

10:24.940 --> 10:27.700
- Listen. We are early but can you
take a break? - It's a perfect time.

10:27.860 --> 10:28.910
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

10:28.910 --> 10:32.160
We brought a lot.
So you can share with your friends.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.910
Hey, I'm sorry I am gonna miss
your party with your friends but

10:38.010 --> 10:39.910
another doctor got sick so...

10:40.290 --> 10:41.540
It's okay.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.848
The next week on my day off
I'm gonna come to school

10:44.849 --> 10:45.750
and I'm gonna take you out of there

10:45.990 --> 10:48.390
We are gonna go out to some cool...
wherever you want your choice

10:48.800 --> 10:50.390
- Just us guys?
- Yeah.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.190
Oh.
Fine if that's the way you two want.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.750
Will Bitecreamers says
he doesn't see ghosts.

11:03.850 --> 11:05.100
He said we made them all up.

11:06.602 --> 11:07.800
Did he used to see them?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.040
Yeah, not anymore.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.646
Why am I gonna stop seeing them?

11:12.646 --> 11:14.640
Do you wanna stop?

11:14.980 --> 11:16.334
Did you?

11:17.510 --> 11:18.830
Sometimes.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.200
What about you?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.640
You know,
to tell you the truth

11:28.460 --> 11:31.650
I don't remember ever seeing them.
I mean I'm sure I did.

11:31.830 --> 11:34.214
But then our old friend are grown up.

11:34.214 --> 11:37.280
Probably came up to me and told
me that I was imagining them.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.790
So they lied to you?

11:40.160 --> 11:41.870
No I think they didn't understand.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.080
Like Bitecreamers
doesn't understand mommy?

11:45.500 --> 11:46.903
Can you still see them?

11:46.903 --> 11:49.760
Is that why we have to keep it a secret?

11:51.827 --> 11:54.867
Does this feel bad having
to keep it a secret?

11:54.867 --> 11:58.690
It's fire I put on that ball,
that was a bullet.

12:00.550 --> 12:02.450
Does all the ghosts like your job?

12:04.880 --> 12:07.800
- Can ghost give birthday presents?
- No.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.810
She's the authority.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.230
- Too bad.
- Yeah, too bad.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.220
Is that Ned's girlfriend?

12:18.500 --> 12:20.450
No that's Del's daughter
she just helping out.

12:21.020 --> 12:23.267
Besides, Ned doesn't really
have time for a girlfriend

12:23.267 --> 12:24.900
with all the coursework you give him.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.690
I have him for one class.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.460
And by the way I've seen him on campus.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.100
He makes time of plenty.

12:30.290 --> 12:31.990
Yeah.
So does this one.

12:32.630 --> 12:34.380
I thought you were dating Steve.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.383
No, at this point,
we are more of just friends.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.561
Okay, so I've met a few more people

12:40.562 --> 12:42.592
now that I have all these
commercial listings.

12:42.592 --> 12:44.390
I should have got my
real estate license.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.380
Is that actual paint on that tail.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.270
No that is velcro.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.500
But it doesn't mean that they won't
find a way to take an eye on with it.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.657
Yeah. It's always a toss up,
you know,

12:54.657 --> 12:56.960
do you order an icecream
truck or an ambulance.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.500
Don't you just miss the days
that one couldn't turn over?

13:01.160 --> 13:03.260
Yeah.
I definitely missed it today.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.090
Right.
The birthday Curse.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.300
I don't know about that one.

13:07.610 --> 13:10.230
Haven't you ever noticed that
every year it's something?

13:10.560 --> 13:13.990
Yeah. I mean last year Aiden fell off
that bouncer and need the sticthes.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.250
And before that I walked
into that plainglass store

13:16.410 --> 13:19.050
Yep. When he was 2 he was
like that crazy high fever.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.658
Oh look at him now.
Aiden's the best one.

13:22.150 --> 13:24.050
He is so much cooler
than the other kids.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.990
- Even he can do tricks.
- All right. Eli.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.750
What the watcher said he has super power

13:33.890 --> 13:35.400
They said he would be powerful.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.040
- You guys are talking about Aiden's
super power? - Both of you, enough.

13:38.758 --> 13:41.130
Okay.
But aren't you curious?

13:41.810 --> 13:46.140
I mean, he's five now. Look at him,
he's just so happy and normal.

13:46.270 --> 13:48.186
Yeah.
You can imagine my concerns.

13:48.186 --> 13:50.610
Cause what mother wouldn't
want a happy normal kid.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.003
Yeah.
But this is not about what you want.

13:53.003 --> 13:56.390
He's life, he's gift makes
him for a larger purpose.

13:58.190 --> 14:01.610
- Who's gonna help me with
the goodie bags? - I'm there.

14:04.050 --> 14:05.460
Come on, you guys.

14:05.570 --> 14:08.370
Hey guys.
Here you go.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.750
Hey, Aiden these goodie
bags are for guests.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.550
Happy birthday to you.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.560
Oh thank you.
Aiden loves that.

14:23.480 --> 14:28.280
Happy birthday to Aiden.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.330
It's okay that you don't have a present.

14:30.530 --> 14:31.640
I have one for you.

14:32.990 --> 14:34.021
Aiden,

14:35.416 --> 14:37.560
are you ready to come with me now?

14:40.550 --> 14:42.052
Aiden,

14:43.894 --> 14:45.502
come with me.

15:03.924 --> 15:07.652
- Who are you?
- Shouldn't you check up the baby?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.506
Aiden, Aiden, baby,
what's up?

15:18.290 --> 15:21.763
Aiden. Oh, God!
Please!

15:24.284 --> 15:26.796
He is on oxygen,
getting the fluids.

15:27.372 --> 15:29.803
Squeeze my hand if you still feel ok.

15:30.906 --> 15:33.649
The bandage comes off
when the I.V. comes out.

15:35.150 --> 15:38.087
Remember squeeze twice when
you feel pain anywhere else.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.450
How could she be doing this to him?

15:40.836 --> 15:43.060
Look, they'll want to run some
tests on him tonight, it'll be ok.

15:43.084 --> 15:46.962
They said his blood pressure is normal.
That his heart is fine.

15:46.990 --> 15:49.318
- Melinda.
- They're not gonna find anything.

16:14.704 --> 16:18.756
- Whare are we?
- At the hospital.

16:18.756 --> 16:21.014
Did we come to pick up daddy?

16:21.014 --> 16:23.864
You don't remember anything?

16:24.270 --> 16:26.607
Did I fall asleep in the car?

16:29.294 --> 16:32.048
No, baby. Come here.

16:39.245 --> 16:41.036
Do they really have
to keep him overnight?

16:41.036 --> 16:42.621
It's good.
He'll get some sleep.

16:43.254 --> 16:45.485
You know, there's gotta be
a medical cause for this.

16:45.485 --> 16:47.578
I am telling you it was a ghost.
I saw her.

16:47.578 --> 16:49.035
You see a lot of ghosts,
all right.

16:49.035 --> 16:50.702
And I've seen you
experience lot of hideous...

16:50.702 --> 16:52.124
I'm the only one who experienced.

16:52.124 --> 16:54.220
I know, in your vision,
but it's over and you are fine.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.605
So was Aiden.

16:55.605 --> 16:57.790
Physically? I mean,
he doesn't remember a thing.

16:57.790 --> 17:01.130
This time,
what if it happens to him?

17:01.130 --> 17:06.010
I don't know.
I don't know what the ghost does.

17:06.010 --> 17:07.694
Does Aiden?

17:12.704 --> 17:16.250
- Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

17:17.343 --> 17:19.588
- How are you doing?
- Good.

17:19.588 --> 17:20.930
Where is dad?

17:20.930 --> 17:23.922
He is doing his rounds.
And then we are going to have breakfast.

17:23.922 --> 17:26.740
- Your dad is gonna take you home.
- Okay.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.818
Then I'm going to figure
out what you are sick.

17:28.818 --> 17:30.636
But I'm not sick.

17:31.624 --> 17:35.950
Aiden, do you remember anything about
last night before you fell asleep?

17:35.950 --> 17:38.502
Did you see someone?

17:38.502 --> 17:41.087
- You mean, a ghost?
- Yes.

17:41.087 --> 17:44.558
Just a lady.
The one who sings to me.

17:44.558 --> 17:47.600
- Sings to you?
- Happy birthday.

17:49.008 --> 17:52.433
- Have you seen her before.
- I see her every year.

17:52.433 --> 17:55.151
- Do you know who she is?
- No.

17:55.361 --> 17:59.234
But she always remembers
my birthday, always.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.832
"She always remembers my birthday",

18:05.832 --> 18:08.264
how long is always to a
little kid do you think?

18:08.264 --> 18:09.490
I bielieve him.

18:09.490 --> 18:11.474
I mean, all the illness,
the accidents,

18:11.474 --> 18:12.640
every year on his birthday

18:12.640 --> 18:15.542
something bad's happened
to Aiden or Jim or me.

18:15.542 --> 18:18.738
I think she's been there.
I mean she's been with us every year.

18:20.471 --> 18:22.950
Yeah, but she's haunting
Aiden or the whole family

18:22.950 --> 18:25.430
and why only on that day?

18:26.564 --> 18:28.722
What?
Five second rule?

18:29.934 --> 18:32.660
If it is every year, how come he
hasn't mentioned her until now?

18:32.660 --> 18:34.100
Because he sees ghosts all the time.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.754
Yeah, and they didn't affect him,

18:35.754 --> 18:37.409
not like the way this one did.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.281
Maybe she is feeding off his strength,

18:39.281 --> 18:40.154
maybe she knows that he is...

18:40.158 --> 18:43.142
What? That he can see ghosts
just like every kid at his age?

18:43.142 --> 18:45.422
Yeah, but he isn't like
any other kid at his age.

18:45.422 --> 18:47.703
Not according to the
watchers and the book.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.738
What about the book?

18:54.451 --> 18:57.030
You know, I've been studying
the book for years now.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.728
I was practically majoring in it.

19:00.128 --> 19:01.972
When I heard about what
happened last night,

19:01.972 --> 19:03.544
I went to the page with your name on it.

19:03.544 --> 19:05.216
The one that predicted Aiden's birth.

19:05.693 --> 19:09.864
You know, sometimes the book changes.
It actually changes.

19:09.864 --> 19:13.814
There's been a new entry.
It's about your son.

19:13.814 --> 19:15.654
Ok.
So what does that mean for Aiden?

19:15.654 --> 19:19.016
I don't know, but that writing,
that is Latin.

19:19.016 --> 19:22.230
It says, when the leaves fall,
so will the innocent.

19:22.706 --> 19:24.532
Maybe the ghost is a part of prophecy,

19:24.532 --> 19:26.358
maybe she's a part of
what's supposed to happen.

19:26.358 --> 19:29.314
What? To Aiden? Is that what we're
really talking about right now?

19:29.314 --> 19:30.719
Because it not gonna happen.

19:30.719 --> 19:32.882
And I want this ghost to
stay away from my son.

19:32.882 --> 19:35.214
Okay.
But we don't even know who she is.

19:37.462 --> 19:40.990
Look, the--the clock stopped right

19:40.990 --> 19:44.038
right before Aiden got back last night.

19:44.606 --> 19:46.811
And it happened once before,

19:46.811 --> 19:49.016
the night he was born.

19:53.606 --> 19:55.082
Cross match two units of pack cells.

19:55.082 --> 19:57.758
Start an I.V. lining.
Get some oxygen.

19:58.286 --> 20:00.462
The patient was in blood.

20:02.044 --> 20:04.866
I think she died at that hospital,

20:04.866 --> 20:07.688
the night my son was born,

20:07.688 --> 20:10.511
11:48 PM.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.948
- Does Jim like working here?
- Yeah, he loves it.

20:17.948 --> 20:20.348
I'm just glad we didn't have
to move for his residency.

20:20.348 --> 20:22.231
But you feel it too, right?

20:22.231 --> 20:24.114
Everytime I treat a patient here,

20:24.114 --> 20:25.998
as soon as I walk into the building.

20:25.998 --> 20:28.388
Yeah, I feel it.

20:28.388 --> 20:30.979
Lost souls,
you know, but

20:30.979 --> 20:33.560
it's a hospital,
people die here.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.321
You know,
I worked at a lot of hospitals.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.083
Something's different about this one.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.880
This is her,
Amber Heaton.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.079
She was only 20 when she died

20:40.079 --> 20:42.678
at the aortic rupture as
a result of child birth.

21:25.965 --> 21:28.095
Don't you dare threathen my son?

21:28.095 --> 21:30.840
I don't have to.
It's already done.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.346
He's mine.

22:17.902 --> 22:19.186
How're we doing?

22:19.186 --> 22:20.912
Better since.

22:21.682 --> 22:24.226
Look, this might not be the
best time to tell you, but

22:24.692 --> 22:26.601
or I'll say maybe it's perfect.

22:27.524 --> 22:28.756
Look, remember that I promised Aiden

22:28.756 --> 22:31.188
that I would take him
anywhere he wanted to go,

22:31.188 --> 22:33.110
as I missed his party.

22:34.338 --> 22:36.117
Look, I caved.

22:36.117 --> 22:39.646
I told him that I would take
him to Pickwick's Fun Factoria

22:39.646 --> 22:40.947
and Bowling Alley.

22:40.947 --> 22:42.262
Pickwick's really?

22:42.262 --> 22:44.142
Yeah. Look, and I told him that
it was once in a life trip,

22:44.142 --> 22:46.440
and I also told him never to
bother you about it again.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.574
Jim, it is fine.
It's your party.

22:49.791 --> 22:52.034
Pickwick's is fine.

22:54.239 --> 22:55.587
Melinda,

22:56.207 --> 22:57.538
what's the matter?

22:58.594 --> 22:59.705
The ghost,

23:00.409 --> 23:03.338
I think she believes that her
son's spirit went into Aiden.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.256
What? Like what happened to me?
Like a step in?

23:05.256 --> 23:08.418
It would explain why she showed
me his body at the morgue.

23:08.418 --> 23:10.487
Why she wrote "He is mine" in blood,

23:10.487 --> 23:12.300
It's not so impossible really.

23:12.300 --> 23:15.678
I mean,
we both had traumatic deliveries.

23:15.678 --> 23:17.028
She died during child birth.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.700
I'm sure if we stay in that
morgue a little longer,

23:18.700 --> 23:20.689
we would have found out
that her son died, too.

23:21.046 --> 23:23.062
Yeah.
But how did he get into Aiden?

23:23.062 --> 23:24.543
Think about it.

23:25.078 --> 23:28.780
Aiden was blue,
his heart wasn't pumping,

23:28.780 --> 23:31.035
We don't know that he didn't
died for a split second,

23:31.036 --> 23:33.290
but long enough for her son to go in.

23:33.290 --> 23:34.592
Honey you don't believe it,
do you?

23:34.592 --> 23:36.429
Not in my heart, no.

23:36.429 --> 23:40.078
But it would explain some things,
like why doesn't he have super powers,

23:40.078 --> 23:42.681
You know, you've just been
talking to Eli too much.

23:42.681 --> 23:44.269
You know,
I would love him the same.

23:44.269 --> 23:47.884
Either way,
he's my son.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.436
But I can't help wondering that

23:51.800 --> 23:54.197
maybe he'll be better off if he wasn't.

23:54.688 --> 23:56.686
Why, why,
becasue the book says.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.824
When the leaves fall,
so will the innocent.

23:59.964 --> 24:02.340
Jim, I'm worried.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.595
What if I don't know what's coming?

24:04.925 --> 24:07.054
What if I can't protect him?

24:12.702 --> 24:13.661
Hello.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.366
Before I tell you what I got,
will you just take a moment

24:16.366 --> 24:18.662
to appreciate how good a friend I am?

24:18.662 --> 24:19.860
Which you get?

24:20.341 --> 24:22.151
The moment I appreciated was
a little longer than that.

24:22.151 --> 24:25.554
But ok, I got all the medical
records of your ghost.

24:25.554 --> 24:26.487
How?

24:26.487 --> 24:28.784
Jim asked all the hospital contacts.

24:28.784 --> 24:32.051
I treat people there.
I have my own system passwords.

24:32.051 --> 24:34.189
I entered a patient name incorrectly,

24:34.190 --> 24:36.260
like illegally incorrectly,

24:36.260 --> 24:38.198
which is why I thought maybe thank you,
you know...

24:38.198 --> 24:40.564
Ok, thank you.
What did you find out?

24:40.564 --> 24:43.515
First of all, it's not a coincidence
that the ghost is attached to you.

24:43.515 --> 24:44.800
You are right.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.210
She died in the O.R.,
the delivery room right next to yours.

24:48.210 --> 24:51.204
Ok, so what happened to Emily's baby?
I mean, did he died?

24:51.204 --> 24:54.772
Almost. His blood supply was cut off,
and he coded.

24:54.772 --> 24:57.301
But he was revived,
no permanent tissue or brain damage.

24:57.301 --> 25:00.018
Thank god.
Ok, so then what?

25:00.018 --> 25:01.300
Then what, what?

25:01.300 --> 25:04.342
If Amber thinks that her baby
died and he came back as Aiden,

25:04.342 --> 25:06.895
which obviously he didn't.
So where is he now?

25:06.895 --> 25:08.948
With his adopted parents, yes.

25:08.948 --> 25:11.194
Wait, it says in his medical
records that he was adopted?

25:11.194 --> 25:14.486
They had to take him into custody.
Amber was dead.

25:14.486 --> 25:16.325
Ok, do his parents have names?

25:18.116 --> 25:21.278
No nice.
Closed adoption.

25:41.728 --> 25:43.783
Ok, we got it,
we got it.

25:43.783 --> 25:45.891
Out at 11:48.

25:47.524 --> 25:49.360
- He's not breathing.
- He isn't breathing.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.992
Why isn't he breathing?

25:52.167 --> 25:54.095
What do you mean he's not breathing?

25:54.701 --> 25:56.664
Jim. Stay with him.
What do you mean he's not breathing?

25:56.664 --> 25:58.759
It's OK.

26:11.450 --> 26:12.718
Amber,

26:14.450 --> 26:15.908
where are you?

26:24.468 --> 26:25.595
Amber?

26:26.878 --> 26:28.142
We need to talk.

26:28.142 --> 26:31.480
I want my baby.
You tryied to take him away from me.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.142
I'm not trying to take
anything away from you.

26:33.142 --> 26:36.181
You told him he doesn't have
to see me if doesn't want to.

26:36.504 --> 26:38.924
Oh, when I told him that he
didn't have to see ghost?

26:38.924 --> 26:40.192
That's what got you upset?

26:40.192 --> 26:43.867
I'm his mother.
A child ought to be with his mother.

26:43.867 --> 26:47.776
You really think that you are Aiden's
mother. What makes you so sure?

26:50.762 --> 26:55.195
There wasn't any time for pain
medication. So I still feel everything.

26:56.132 --> 26:58.372
I was bleeding so badly.

26:58.690 --> 27:01.303
My baby was dying inside of me.

27:01.303 --> 27:03.485
They were racing to get him out, but

27:03.485 --> 27:05.906
even when they got him free,

27:05.906 --> 27:09.362
he was too weak.
He wouldn't breath.

27:09.928 --> 27:13.070
I kept trying to tell
them to show me my son.

27:13.070 --> 27:15.033
They wouldn't let me speak.

27:15.481 --> 27:18.408
I saw two nurses rushed him away,

27:19.313 --> 27:21.448
I couldn't fight any more.

27:31.903 --> 27:35.826
One of the nurses came back.
She said something to the other nurse,

27:36.442 --> 27:38.582
I knew that my baby was dead,

27:39.140 --> 27:41.978
I kept screaming at them to
tell me what had happened.

27:41.978 --> 27:44.204
But they couldn't hear me.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.442
I waited to take him into the light.

27:47.442 --> 27:49.656
But he didn't come.

27:50.232 --> 27:52.489
And then I heard him.

27:54.582 --> 27:55.895
He was alive.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.459
He might have delivered in another form.
But my son was alive,

28:02.459 --> 28:06.054
But you didn't see his spirit
go into my son's body, did you?

28:06.054 --> 28:07.734
I didn't have to.

28:07.734 --> 28:12.442
That child,
the one you called Aiden. He's mine.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.108
If you are sure,
then why would you hurt him?

28:14.109 --> 28:16.014
Why would you want him to suffer?

28:16.014 --> 28:17.101
I would never do that.

28:17.101 --> 28:19.817
But you did.
You give him those symptoms.

28:19.817 --> 28:21.760
No, I didn't.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.130
I was just watching him.
I was just watching my son.

28:25.130 --> 28:27.290
Amber, there is something
that you need to know.

28:27.290 --> 28:31.785
Your son's spirit didn't need anther
child's body because he didn't die.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.540
But those nurses...

28:33.540 --> 28:35.357
They were probably talking about you.

28:35.357 --> 28:39.070
That what a tragedy it was that
you never got to hold your son.

28:39.498 --> 28:42.253
I don't understand.
If he's still alive, where is he?

28:42.253 --> 28:43.854
He was adopted.

28:44.470 --> 28:45.444
That can't be.

28:45.444 --> 28:48.700
It's true and it's really good news.

28:49.340 --> 28:51.616
He went straight to the
family that you chose for him.

28:51.616 --> 28:52.496
I choose?

28:52.496 --> 28:54.065
It was closed adoption.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.233
That means there was a contract that
you probably agreed to in advance.

28:57.233 --> 29:00.499
- No. That's no possible.
I didn't want that. - What do you mean?

29:00.499 --> 29:04.459
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- Yes you can. You have to.

29:12.828 --> 29:14.793
Is that the adopted father?

29:27.574 --> 29:29.717
That message was for the nurses.

29:29.717 --> 29:32.926
You changed your mind about the
adoption. You want to keep your baby.

29:32.926 --> 29:35.205
They can't have him.

29:35.205 --> 29:36.360
It's too late.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.388
Your babe belongs to them now.

29:38.388 --> 29:40.593
He belongs with me.

29:46.324 --> 29:47.353
You're not gonna find them.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.621
And closed adoptions,
the birth parents, the adopt parents,

29:49.621 --> 29:51.888
- The record just sealed.
- Well, I have to find them.

29:51.888 --> 29:53.840
I mean,
you should see how angry she was.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.055
- At you. - No.

29:55.055 --> 29:57.055
The adopted father,
they were arguing.

29:57.055 --> 30:00.194
Arguing, they should never even met.

30:00.947 --> 30:01.970
What were they arguing about?

30:01.970 --> 30:04.137
She changed her mind,
it sounds like he was threatening her.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.697
You know,
maybe he was gonna take her to court.

30:07.080 --> 30:10.337
Yeah, but don't the adoption
laws protect the birth mother,

30:10.337 --> 30:12.454
it always allows for a change of heart.

30:12.454 --> 30:16.958
I mean,
he would not have a leg to stand on it.

30:21.182 --> 30:23.549
- Unless.
- Unless he has his own right.

30:23.549 --> 30:27.025
Parental rights, like the kind you
would get if you were the blood father.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.442
Adopting your own kid,
I mean, why would he do that?

30:29.442 --> 30:30.955
She was 20 years old.

30:30.955 --> 30:33.663
He looked like he was in his
late 30s and I guess married.

30:33.663 --> 30:35.293
Yeah, how do they get involved?

30:35.293 --> 30:39.179
The girl's sealbag said she was
an intern in Ufland Consulting.

30:42.381 --> 30:43.324
There he is.

30:43.324 --> 30:46.416
The guy she was arguing with,
Dale Harmon.

30:52.019 --> 30:54.396
- Hello.
- Hi. My name is Melinda Gordon.

30:55.420 --> 30:59.514
Listen, Dale's son goes to school
with mine, does he have a minute?

30:59.514 --> 31:02.141
Oh, I'm sorry. He's not here.
He's at his son's birthday party.

31:02.141 --> 31:06.748
Oh, right, yeah, he's at Tyer's
birthday party, of course.

31:06.748 --> 31:10.363
- Tell him that Aiden is a guest.
- Right. Right.

31:10.882 --> 31:12.507
You know,
we are supposed to be there.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.471
But with lost the invite.
Can you tell me where the party is?

31:17.858 --> 31:19.142
Thank you.

31:19.887 --> 31:21.217
What? What's wrong?

31:21.217 --> 31:22.772
They are at Pickwick's.

31:22.772 --> 31:25.693
- So. - That's where Jim took Aiden.
They're at the same place.

31:25.693 --> 31:28.378
I'm so sorry, but just once,
can you just watch the store?

31:28.378 --> 31:30.786
Yes, of course.
I still have my key.

31:30.786 --> 31:32.487
But relax, Mel,
that's a coincidence.

31:32.487 --> 31:34.592
Yeah, I used to believe in conincidence.

31:34.592 --> 31:35.611
What happened?

31:35.611 --> 31:37.767
I red a book that change my mind.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.704
I thought we shouldn't go bowling.

31:39.704 --> 31:43.030
You wanna tell me how you got so
good on air hocky all of a sudden.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.935
Sneaking down here with
your mother, correct?

31:44.935 --> 31:47.849
Mom hates this place,
you know that.

31:48.395 --> 31:51.392
Dad, did you play your holidays?

31:51.392 --> 31:53.845
Yeah, I did.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.380
Just about.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.463
How hungry are you?

31:56.463 --> 31:59.755
- How about some birthday pizza.
How do you feel like that? - Yeah.

32:03.030 --> 32:04.569
What's your name?

32:06.347 --> 32:07.883
Do you know who I am?

32:09.294 --> 32:11.102
You should know who I am.

32:14.814 --> 32:16.617
Tylar, don't go too far.

32:16.617 --> 32:19.385
- Leave me alone.
- Hey, what do you want on your pizza.

32:19.770 --> 32:23.408
What is it?
Ok, there you go.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.740
Why don't you go barn some quaters
while I wait for your food.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.754
But stay while I can see you come out.

32:27.754 --> 32:28.671
Ok.

32:41.235 --> 32:42.296
Hi, honey,
how are you doing?

32:42.296 --> 32:44.618
The couple that adopted
the girl's child are there.

32:44.618 --> 32:46.988
- They're here?
- I need you to talk to them for me.

32:46.988 --> 32:49.415
Keep an eye on their son
until I can get there.

32:49.415 --> 32:50.809
How can I tell who they are?

32:50.809 --> 32:52.515
Yeah, I'll describe the dad.

32:52.938 --> 32:56.790
The father's tall,
brown hair and the son is Aiden's age.

33:01.091 --> 33:02.925
Why are you following me?

33:13.420 --> 33:14.640
Leave me alone.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.755
Why won't you leave me alone?

33:16.831 --> 33:18.594
I thought you were dead.

33:18.594 --> 33:21.034
Don't you know me?
I'm your mommy.

33:21.204 --> 33:22.501
No, you're not.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.925
Who said that,
sweet heart?

33:23.925 --> 33:26.613
Go away.
I don't like you.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.264
Please don't speak to me that way.

33:28.264 --> 33:31.220
He doesn't understand.
He's just scared.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.412
Please, stop scaring him.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.771
I'm his mother.

33:34.771 --> 33:36.233
No, you are not.

33:36.233 --> 33:38.186
They took him away from me.

33:39.097 --> 33:41.098
Now, he hates me.

33:41.594 --> 33:43.710
They made hime hate me.

33:47.451 --> 33:49.385
I won't let them take him.

33:49.999 --> 33:52.265
I won't let them take him.

34:09.367 --> 34:11.634
Mel, hi,
this is Dale and his wife Emily.

34:11.634 --> 34:13.886
Hi, I'm...
She is not here.

34:13.886 --> 34:14.813
Where's the son?

34:14.813 --> 34:16.283
I don't know,
let's just say we can't find him.

34:16.283 --> 34:17.355
Ok, what about Aiden?

34:17.355 --> 34:20.351
No, no. It's all right.
He's right there by the...

34:34.414 --> 34:36.222
I won't let them take him.

34:36.666 --> 34:38.757
I won't let them take him.

34:38.969 --> 34:41.119
I won't let them take him.

34:41.543 --> 34:46.393
Get off him. He is my son,
don't take him away from me.

34:46.831 --> 34:48.261
I swear he was right by the machine.

34:48.261 --> 34:49.453
Ok.
Just check the kitchen.

34:49.453 --> 34:51.920
All right, we'll take the lance
and I'm gonna go this way.

35:00.621 --> 35:01.879
Melinda.

35:03.540 --> 35:04.304
Where are they?

35:04.304 --> 35:07.155
I'm afraid it's too late,
you can't help them.

35:07.155 --> 35:08.514
Are they in danger?

35:08.514 --> 35:09.666
Aiden isn't

35:09.666 --> 35:11.024
if he stays where he is.

35:11.024 --> 35:12.819
What about Tyler?

35:16.030 --> 35:18.964
Aiden, please hear me.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.599
Just stay where you are.

35:21.599 --> 35:24.692
Ok, and make sure that
Tyler stays with you.

35:27.423 --> 35:29.831
- Come here.
- No, I'm scared.

35:29.831 --> 35:31.248
You are not safe there.

35:31.248 --> 35:32.537
How do you know?

35:32.537 --> 35:35.011
I don't know.
I just know.

35:40.077 --> 35:42.735
Quick. Grab my hand.

35:56.143 --> 35:57.620
I got you.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.402
- Tyler. - Aiden.

36:00.402 --> 36:01.320
Mommy.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.016
Honey, are you ok?

36:03.592 --> 36:05.520
- Mommy. - Aiden.

36:06.061 --> 36:07.548
Tyler, come here.

36:08.111 --> 36:09.587
Hold on, ok?
Just hold on.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.816
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:14.816 --> 36:16.259
I mean,
Tyler stays with me.

36:16.259 --> 36:17.511
Like I was supposed to.

36:17.511 --> 36:19.283
Who told you that you're supposed to?

36:19.283 --> 36:21.539
I don't know.
Did I make a mistake?

36:21.539 --> 36:24.669
No. No, baby.
You did great.

36:24.669 --> 36:25.967
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.666
- Ok, good.
-I'm Ok. Mom.

36:35.849 --> 36:37.269
How are you doing?

36:37.269 --> 36:38.625
Still a little rattled.

36:38.625 --> 36:41.386
- Do you need decaf?
- I think so.

36:42.043 --> 36:43.703
All the boys seem ok.

36:43.703 --> 36:44.724
Thanks.

36:48.359 --> 36:50.949
I think Amber is ready to talk now.

36:52.531 --> 36:54.999
Why don't I give your
husband a hand with the boys.

36:59.053 --> 37:02.073
I'm sorry about what
I did in that place.

37:02.073 --> 37:04.101
I didn't know I could do that.

37:04.627 --> 37:08.844
She's sorry about what
happened with the boys.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.132
She didn't know her own strength.

37:11.132 --> 37:13.687
Yeah. Well, I'm...
I'm sorry, too.

37:13.687 --> 37:15.199
Can you tell her why?

37:17.060 --> 37:19.427
I'm not pride of what I did back then.

37:19.531 --> 37:21.266
It was a hard time for me and Emily,

37:21.267 --> 37:22.351
but that's no excuse.

37:22.351 --> 37:24.310
So then what happened?

37:24.310 --> 37:27.556
They were trying really hard to get
pregnant. But it wasn't working out.

37:27.556 --> 37:29.173
My wife and I were having problems.

37:29.173 --> 37:30.549
I stayed late at the office and

37:30.549 --> 37:35.247
Amber was always right
there just ready to listen.

37:35.247 --> 37:37.777
It was a party to celebrete
landing a new client.

37:37.777 --> 37:39.666
There was some office party.

37:39.666 --> 37:42.097
I know it's a cliche.

37:44.897 --> 37:47.681
I never thought I could
do something like that.

37:50.063 --> 37:54.866
Is was one time,
one time and I was pregnant.

37:57.467 --> 38:00.162
I knew I had to have the baby,

38:01.364 --> 38:03.563
but I was 20 years old.

38:03.563 --> 38:05.589
I thought I had my whole
life in front of me.

38:05.589 --> 38:10.197
Emily, she... we really,
really wanted children.

38:10.467 --> 38:12.105
And we've already decided to adopt

38:12.105 --> 38:14.173
when Amber came to me pregnant.

38:14.173 --> 38:16.750
So you thought a closed
adoption would be prefect

38:16.750 --> 38:18.557
because then your baby
would have a home.

38:18.557 --> 38:22.922
Without anger or resentment
and his wife will never know.

38:23.215 --> 38:25.375
And then she changed her mind.

38:25.405 --> 38:28.058
At the last moment I
thought I could do it.

38:28.427 --> 38:30.417
I can raise my son.

38:33.585 --> 38:36.226
I didn't know what would happen.

38:36.226 --> 38:39.639
I didn't know how she'd treat
him if she ever knew the truth.

38:43.097 --> 38:45.862
- Is she here?
- Yeah.

38:45.862 --> 38:47.813
It's Ok,
Emily knows everything.

38:47.814 --> 38:49.587
I told her that night.

38:54.383 --> 38:57.387
When man you love, trusted,

38:57.388 --> 39:00.091
comes to you with something like this.

39:00.775 --> 39:02.895
It could turn your heart to stone.

39:04.913 --> 39:07.689
Unless you're holding
a baby in your arms.

39:07.689 --> 39:12.683
Watching him grow,
knowing he needs you,

39:12.693 --> 39:14.511
He needs love.

39:18.895 --> 39:20.946
He needed us.

39:21.615 --> 39:25.349
Because Amber who left him
and gave him my foster home.

39:30.151 --> 39:32.508
I saw that before,

39:33.160 --> 39:35.527
but I felt so alone.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.291
So scared for him.

39:41.050 --> 39:43.821
But I know you are Ok now.
Aren't you, sweetheart?

39:48.789 --> 39:50.576
Tell them to be good to him.

39:53.871 --> 39:55.453
To keep loving him.

39:56.207 --> 39:58.738
She wants you to love him.

39:59.275 --> 40:01.151
The way that she would have.

40:01.151 --> 40:05.660
We will.
I think we always have.

40:06.253 --> 40:10.770
And one day he was ready,
I will tell him all about you.

40:27.045 --> 40:28.427
She's gone.

40:35.755 --> 40:37.081
I got it.

40:38.931 --> 40:40.131
You catch me.

40:46.477 --> 40:48.334
- Buy. - Buy.

40:48.876 --> 40:50.297
I've got company.

40:51.111 --> 40:52.675
I will be inside.

40:54.599 --> 40:57.719
OK.
So how long have you known?

40:57.719 --> 40:58.883
Konwn what?

40:58.883 --> 41:01.411
How long have you known
what my son can do?

41:01.411 --> 41:04.259
You mean what you two can do together?

41:05.523 --> 41:07.501
Look, we're connected.

41:07.501 --> 41:09.904
I've always known that somehow, but

41:10.909 --> 41:13.663
the visions I've had
they've been from Aiden?

41:13.663 --> 41:15.596
How do they come to him?

41:15.596 --> 41:18.688
I mean, is he...
is he a sensitive?

41:18.688 --> 41:21.703
The words you're looking for is empath.

41:21.703 --> 41:25.954
He can share other people's feelings.
Their experiences.

41:26.342 --> 41:28.448
That's why he's sick and he gets better,

41:28.448 --> 41:30.288
Why he turned blue and couldn't talk.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.196
It's like he's experencing something

41:32.196 --> 41:35.021
that somebody else has
already been through somehow.

41:35.021 --> 41:37.512
Like the day he was born?

41:38.550 --> 41:40.569
And every birthday since.

41:42.849 --> 41:46.271
Her symptoms.
She relived them and

41:46.271 --> 41:48.412
he relived them right along with her.

41:48.412 --> 41:51.485
And you relived some of
the tell through him.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.989
Tea.
You want a refill?

41:56.171 --> 42:00.013
I would love whisky sour.

42:01.871 --> 42:03.975
Sometimes I just wish you
were less of a watcher

42:03.975 --> 42:05.005
and more of a talker.

42:05.005 --> 42:06.671
I mean,
people almost got hurt.

42:06.671 --> 42:10.445
That's how we learn.
All of us living and dead.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.895
And besides,
it's the rules.

42:12.895 --> 42:15.832
God, you have an answer for everything.

42:15.832 --> 42:18.417
If I did,

42:18.417 --> 42:22.609
there'll be no need for
us to watch with there.

42:39.635 --> 42:41.103
What are we gonna tell him?

42:41.995 --> 42:45.333
Nothing.
Not about this.

42:45.333 --> 42:47.415
You don't want him to know
he's connected to you.

42:47.415 --> 42:50.085
No, if he did then

42:50.085 --> 42:54.421
he'd know that his
dreams aren't really his.

42:55.591 --> 42:57.278
I want his dreams to belong to him

42:57.278 --> 42:59.199
like any little boy.

43:01.745 --> 43:05.105
I heard your voices.
I thought you were in my dream.

43:06.303 --> 43:07.235
No.

43:07.235 --> 43:09.422
But you're our dream.
