02:48.383 --> 02:53.038
to a continual parade
of environmental disasters,

has come together to create
the first space station on Earth,

03:18.076 --> 03:20.770
a self-contained world,
a pure environment,

03:20.870 --> 03:25.524
unspoiled, unpolluted, a world
that no longer exists outside.

03:25.624 --> 03:30.236
This Earth Day, Dr Faulkner and four
carefully chosen, qualified scientists

03:30.336 --> 03:34.824

17:17.436 --> 17:21.798
but as you see,
right now we have work to do.

17:21.897 --> 17:23.974
Work to do!

17:28.405 --> 17:34.894
Who could be stupid enough
to think Bio-Dome was a mall?

17:34.994 --> 17:37.562
Bud MacIntosh and Doyle Johnson.

17:37.662 --> 17:40.732
Generation-X road kill
on the superhighway of progress.

17:40.832 --> 17:44.236
They're not terrorists,
they're college students from Tucson.

17:44.336 --> 17:47.363
They really did think it was a mall.

17:47.463 --> 17:51.742
- Get them out now!
- The doors are sealed for one year.

17:51.842 --> 17:56.788
I can't open the doors. If I do, the integrity
of all the scientific data is compromised.

17:56.888 --> 18:00.500
Everything depends
on the precise time frame of one year!

18:00.600 --> 18:03.961
Screw the time frame!
I have $100 million invested in this,

18:04.061 --> 18:08.799
and I don't intend to lose it
because two twits from Tucson

18:08.899 --> 18:12.553
can't tell a mall toilet
from a damned rain forest!

18:15.947 --> 18:18.937
(WHISPERS) Squirl, break the ice.

18:22.786 --> 18:26.438
- Excuse me, Miss. Are you tired?
- I beg your pardon.

18:26.538 --> 18:29.066
- Are you tired?
- No. Why?

18:29.166 --> 18:33.736
Cos you've been running
through my mind all day.

18:33.836 --> 18:35.949
Excuse me, Miss.

18:37.006 --> 18:41.869
If you were a yoghurt, would you be
fruit at the bottom, or stirred?

18:41.969 --> 18:44.876
This is your problem. Fix it.

18:45.389 --> 18:50.960
- Then they have to stay.
- All our preparation was for five people.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.713
Adding two more
will throw the system off balance.

18:53.813 --> 18:57.183
Then the system... will adapt.

19:00.193 --> 19:02.804
- Did it hurt?
- Did what hurt?

19:02.904 --> 19:05.349
When you fell from heaven, did it hurt?

19:07.449 --> 19:10.227
Bud! Doyle! Hello!

19:10.327 --> 19:14.814
I'm Dr Noah Faulkner. You may recognise
me from my Bio-Dome films on television.

19:14.914 --> 19:17.734
Are you the guy with the spray-on hair?

19:17.834 --> 19:21.613
Anyway, as I'm sure you already know,

19:21.713 --> 19:25.657
you have stumbled
into an exciting new world.

19:25.757 --> 19:29.453
Tell me, have you ever
dreamt of being famous?

19:29.553 --> 19:35.082
When I was a kid I wanted to be a rock
star cos I could do this with my finger.

19:35.182 --> 19:39.503
But as I got older I realised
that the corporate rock world sucked.

19:39.603 --> 19:41.713
And besides, you only knew one song.

19:41.813 --> 19:45.383
<i>♪ Iron Man, Iron Man,
does whatever an iron can</i>

19:45.483 --> 19:48.935
- <i>♪ Pancake-flat, like a glove...</i>
- Hold it!

19:49.320 --> 19:53.349
That's "Spider-Man".
Black Sabbath did "Iron Man".

19:53.449 --> 19:56.643
Oh, come on!
What, do you think you're so... smart?

19:56.743 --> 19:59.103
Do you think
you're some rocket scientist?

19:59.203 --> 20:01.613
- Yes.
- Sorry.

20:01.998 --> 20:04.233
What do you boys want out of life?

20:04.333 --> 20:07.121
To die and come back as a leotard.

20:09.046 --> 20:11.030
Well...

20:11.130 --> 20:16.125
I may be able to offer you
a springboard to that future.

20:17.178 --> 20:21.832
- We would like you to stay with us.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, man.

20:21.932 --> 20:25.043
You guys aren't one of those
freaky clans, are you?

20:25.143 --> 20:28.045
Dancing naked, you want us
to take off our clothes,

20:28.145 --> 20:30.934
- and feed us some weird punch?
- No.

20:32.316 --> 20:36.017
Damn! We almost had it.
It was this close.

20:37.236 --> 20:42.141
Boys, this is where you'll be staying,
and I want you to feel right at home.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.317
BOTH: <i>♪ Wah, wah, wah</i>

20:45.827 --> 20:49.731
We'd be obliged if we could get
some nice cushy beds with magic fingers.

20:49.831 --> 20:53.651
Like the ones at the mall that
the big tourists lie in for free.

20:53.751 --> 20:56.654
They just plop down,
the little kids are around them.

20:56.754 --> 21:00.282
"Daddy, look at the little thing!"
And it just rolls...

21:00.382 --> 21:02.200
Ow! Ow! I have a sciatic!

21:02.300 --> 21:06.830
- Actually, we have no extra beds.
- Can we just get our own mattress?

21:06.930 --> 21:09.373
- Sorry, no.
- Here, guys.

21:09.473 --> 21:13.252
- Petra and I can live without this stuff.
- I know it's not much.

21:13.352 --> 21:17.516
Hey, have you ever been
with a squirrel and a stub?

21:21.276 --> 21:23.352
For the pillow.

21:24.361 --> 21:28.849
(SINGSONG) You lose the pillow!
For the blanket.

21:28.949 --> 21:31.143
You lose the blanket!

21:31.243 --> 21:33.318
For fun.

21:41.418 --> 21:43.487
DOYLE: I can't sleep.

21:43.587 --> 21:45.663
I can't sleep either.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.293
Let's go find us some beds.

22:00.393 --> 22:03.099
(♪ "I WANT CANDY" BY BOW WOW WOW)

22:21.745 --> 22:23.438

22:23.538 --> 22:25.615
PETRA: Get out of here!

22:38.301 --> 22:41.007
(SQUAWKS) Wake up! Smell the coffee.

22:43.890 --> 22:48.836
Good morning, and congratulations, all.
We have survived night one.

22:48.936 --> 22:52.637
- Congratulations, Doyle!
- (GRUNTS)

22:53.147 --> 22:59.262
And the best thing is,
homeostasis was maintained all night.

22:59.362 --> 23:01.521
No!

23:02.572 --> 23:04.391
No!

23:04.491 --> 23:09.228
It is bad enough that for the next year
I must share my air, food and water

23:09.328 --> 23:11.981
with these... Neanderthals.

23:12.081 --> 23:15.818
But I will not share
my tools of hygiene!

23:15.918 --> 23:20.580
Relax! It's sanitised.
I dunked it in Olivia's Scope.

23:21.756 --> 23:23.750
- Simian!
- Dick!

23:26.802 --> 23:30.455
Look, you guys are the ones
that wanted us to stay.

23:30.555 --> 23:35.001
Think back. "Springboard into the future".
We didn't prepare for this voyage.

23:35.101 --> 23:38.796
We need clean teeth too, all right?
His teeth... Look.

23:38.896 --> 23:41.715
You are absolutely right.

23:41.815 --> 23:45.268
You should be brought up to speed.
It is time for a tour.

23:46.778 --> 23:51.891
Boys. Boys! From here you can see
all the regions of the Bio-Dome:

23:51.991 --> 23:57.021
The rain forest, the tropical lagoon,
the farm, and the great desert.

23:57.121 --> 24:00.440
Every effort was made
to duplicate them precisely,

24:00.540 --> 24:03.115
and all of this is your home now.

24:06.086 --> 24:11.867
But remember, the survival of this system
is dependent upon homeostasis.

24:11.967 --> 24:16.961
That means a balance
within an enclosed system itself.

24:19.056 --> 24:21.416
Faulkner?

24:21.516 --> 24:23.593
Could we get some binoculars?

24:27.397 --> 24:29.465
Let's make a rule:

24:29.565 --> 24:33.636
Everything that you did at home,
you're forbidden to do here.

24:33.736 --> 24:35.179
BOTH: Everything?

24:35.279 --> 24:37.641
Shave poochie-poochie.

24:38.031 --> 24:40.393
Shave poochie-poochie.

24:47.873 --> 24:49.775
- Everything.
- OK.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.035
- All right.
- Don't move.

24:53.378 --> 24:56.072
- I'll be right back.
- I got a wicked itch on my nads.

24:56.172 --> 24:57.917
Don't move!

25:04.054 --> 25:08.083
(WHISPERS) Bud,
I got a wicked itch on my nads.

25:08.183 --> 25:11.386
(WHISPERS) Faulkner said don't move.

25:13.938 --> 25:17.967
I can't take it any more!
I can't take it any more!

25:18.067 --> 25:21.261
Well, I guess this means
we're our own tour guides.

25:21.361 --> 25:25.223
All right. Now, everybody,
do not feed the animals, stay together,

25:25.323 --> 25:27.391
and no flash photography.

25:27.491 --> 25:32.437
Remember, at Bio-Dome we're dependent
on balancing homos within the system.

25:32.537 --> 25:37.449
OK. Now, everybody stay with the group.
Follow me. This way.

25:38.209 --> 25:42.487
- Jerk! You shouldn't have hit me so hard.

25:42.587 --> 25:45.615
(WHISPERS) No, wait.
Come here, come here.

25:45.715 --> 25:50.994
- Hey! There's no knob here!
- OLIVIA: Oh, God. Here we go.

25:51.095 --> 25:54.206
Olivia, what's with this door?
It's not opening.

25:54.306 --> 25:57.585
Of course it won't open.
It won't open again for an entire year.

25:57.685 --> 26:00.753
Nothing comes in, nothing goes out.
Not even air.

26:00.853 --> 26:04.174
It would take a Sherman tank
to open that door.

26:04.274 --> 26:08.635
- Hmm... So what you're saying is...
- You can't get out.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.929
- We're stuck here.
- For 12 months.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.390
- That's right.
- 12 months?

26:13.490 --> 26:15.516
- 52 weeks.
- Yes!

26:15.616 --> 26:18.060
Three hundred and eighty-five days?!

26:18.160 --> 26:20.024
Yes. Yes. Yes!

26:21.414 --> 26:25.115

27:42.944 --> 27:45.221

And you're a miracle too, Petri.

27:55.829 --> 27:58.107
Why are you putting him

27:58.207 --> 28:02.277
Tilapia are an integral part
of our food supply.

28:02.377 --> 28:07.574
- They eat the algae then fertilise the rice.
- So then these... tipatilia,

28:07.674 --> 28:10.159
they're goin' unh-unh on the rice?

28:10.259 --> 28:12.161

28:20.560 --> 28:22.969

I told you we were into nurturing
Mother Earth, but you didn't believe us.

Now you guys are thinking locally,
and we're acting globally!

30:04.108 --> 30:06.010
- Just get out of there.
- We can't.

30:06.110 --> 30:08.471
We signed up. We're part of the few.

30:08.571 --> 30:13.308
- Part of the problem!
- It's an important biological experiment.

30:13.408 --> 30:16.562

Don't you think your couch

30:23.417 --> 30:26.820
So what are we supposed to do?
Wait a year for you guys to get out?

30:26.920 --> 30:32.200

30:36.679 --> 30:38.998
and now is that time.

30:39.098 --> 30:43.126

- No. This is how I really feel.

30:43.226 --> 30:45.920
Budly! There's people around.

30:46.020 --> 30:47.881
I know. I miss you.

30:47.981 --> 30:49.798
I'm proud of you.

30:49.898 --> 30:52.307
So I guess this is goodbye.

30:52.901 --> 30:54.978
I guess.

31:07.539 --> 31:10.031

31:10.584 --> 31:13.705
Well... We gotta go. Bye.

Bye.

31:30.559 --> 31:32.921
Cheers, mate.

31:43.070 --> 31:47.151
- What's with this Kibble?
- Are you guys trying to poison us?

31:47.657 --> 31:51.311
- You don't like soy casserole?
- It tastes like it came out of Romulus.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.188
Maybe it did.

31:53.288 --> 31:57.441
Soy is our principal source of protein.
You'll learn to love it.

31:57.541 --> 32:03.196
Could you at least make it taste
like chicken? A bouillon base, paprika...

32:03.296 --> 32:07.992
Spice it up a little? Otherwise
I'm gonna shrivel up like a supermodel.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.328
- I am so fat!
- No, you're not.

32:11.428 --> 32:14.081
- Nobody likes me.
- You're beautiful.

32:14.181 --> 32:18.085
- People didn't like me in high school.
- Everybody loves you.

32:18.185 --> 32:21.921
Oh, thank you! You're so sweet, Naomi.

32:22.021 --> 32:24.976

Are you sleepin'?

32:43.248 --> 32:46.609
- What'd you have to hit me for?
- I can't sleep.

32:46.709 --> 32:48.236
Oh...

32:48.336 --> 32:52.030
Hey, just think back
to those sleepovers we used to have.

32:52.130 --> 32:55.200
If you think back,
then maybe you'll be able to sleep.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.377
- OK.
- OK.

32:59.137 --> 33:03.503
(BUD HOWLS) What's up, buddy?
Cos I'm the weasel.

33:04.559 --> 33:06.502
OK, my turn.

33:06.602 --> 33:08.678
(FARTS)

33:13.942 --> 33:16.017
(SNIFFS)

33:19.155 --> 33:22.099
Peanut butter and jelly with bacon.
That's easy.

33:22.199 --> 33:27.353
Good call, man! Keep on cruisin'.
Keep on goin'.

33:27.453 --> 33:29.816
Keep on goin' down the line.

33:32.666 --> 33:36.403
Mixed green salad with 1000...
blue cheese dressing.

33:36.503 --> 33:41.407
Rad, dude! That was fully major.
Your beaker always knows, buddy.

33:41.507 --> 33:46.496
Keep on cruisin'. Come on, buddy.
It's OK. Keep on cruisin'.

33:46.596 --> 33:48.755
Wait. It's over here now.

33:58.105 --> 34:02.519
Yo, Mone. Check it out. Your friends
Bob and Darryl are gettin' tail.

34:07.572 --> 34:10.360
- Assholes!
- If I were you, Mone,

34:10.617 --> 34:14.018
I'd go out and hump for the next year.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.480
If I were you, Russ,

34:16.580 --> 34:19.983
I'd have my mouth full of shotgun
with my toe on the trigger.

34:20.083 --> 34:24.117
It's frightening how much you want me.

34:27.547 --> 34:30.254
Stubby! "Thriving on Chaos"!

34:31.967 --> 34:35.920
Those'll sell better
than Iron Maiden merch.

34:37.264 --> 34:40.751
Let's hope so. I just want
you gentlemen to remember

34:40.851 --> 34:44.879
how important you are
to this whole experiment.

34:44.978 --> 34:50.592
Feel free to contribute. You are
an integral part of the Bio-Dome system.

34:50.693 --> 34:52.969
Um... Since you put it that way,

34:53.070 --> 34:56.598
we were thinking of you producing
maybe environmental condoms,

34:56.697 --> 35:01.602
so when you... rip the packet,
it's automatic sap lubrication.

35:01.702 --> 35:07.191
No chalk on the bark. And then
when you're pollinating your flower...

35:07.291 --> 35:10.944
Slide, slide, slipperty-slide.
Just smooth.

35:11.044 --> 35:14.531
- Right in.
- And the Bud and Doyle action figures.

35:14.631 --> 35:19.044
- Action figures.
- Anatomically correct, of course.

35:25.890 --> 35:30.003
And last but not least,
1-900-SQUIRLY-STUB.

35:30.103 --> 35:31.717
Watch this.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.803
- HUSKY: Hi, I'm Doyle.
- And I'm Bud.

35:39.903 --> 35:43.056
And when we're not out
saving the environment,

35:43.156 --> 35:48.269
we're thinking of you, naked,
thigh-deep in tofu.

35:52.497 --> 35:54.859
You likey, Leaky?

35:56.293 --> 36:01.703
BUD: Our home is the Garden of Eden!

36:02.006 --> 36:05.742
More like the Garden of Boredom,
and I'm chairman of the bored.

36:05.842 --> 36:08.495
Come on, Stub. We can have our own fun.

36:08.595 --> 36:11.798
Remember the time the Magnavox
went out? What did we do?

36:14.475 --> 36:20.339
Fly, Mary Poppins!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

36:20.439 --> 36:22.715
Can we do it again, Squirly?

36:22.815 --> 36:26.135
- Those were the days.
- Cheer up, buckaroo.

36:26.235 --> 36:29.971
Just cos we're stuck in a bubble
doesn't mean we can't cause any trouble.

36:30.071 --> 36:32.432
We're the everlasting force

36:32.532 --> 36:36.603
of Squirly!

36:36.703 --> 36:38.281
Stubby!

36:41.248 --> 36:45.200
You ready? Hut one, hut two,
hut, hut, hike!

36:48.880 --> 36:50.407
- Let me through!
- No!

36:50.507 --> 36:53.081
- Come on, let me through.
- No!

36:57.763 --> 37:00.708
- Neon Deion!
- No fair!

37:00.808 --> 37:03.167
- No fair! Personal foul!
- You want some of me?

37:03.267 --> 37:07.463
I told you
you shouldn't have had some of me.

37:07.563 --> 37:09.842
Squirly!

37:10.899 --> 37:12.975
Fish on the play!

37:13.819 --> 37:16.972
My proposal
is that we plant these seeds.

37:17.072 --> 37:20.766
And I know you're thinkin'
"Illegal! Illegal!"

37:20.866 --> 37:26.188
But the value of purple sticky punge
goes way beyond just tokin' it.

37:26.288 --> 37:33.739
- Ain't that right, Professor Johnson?
- That's correct, Professor MacIntosh.

37:34.795 --> 37:39.992
"Purple sticky punge, or hemp,
is an excellent source of paper."

37:40.092 --> 37:42.119
"It makes a fine rope."

37:42.219 --> 37:45.913
"It can even make
a contaminant-free fuel."

37:46.013 --> 37:53.503
"But the greatest value to us Bio-Domers
is its rapid rate of photosyninthesis,

37:53.603 --> 37:57.590
which means more oxygen for everyone."

37:59.775 --> 38:02.220
BOTH: On three... Three!

38:16.081 --> 38:18.158
Cannonball!

38:23.921 --> 38:26.074
- There you go, Mr Bloom.
- Thanks, girls.

38:26.174 --> 38:29.243
Tell Bud and Doyle
I'm writin' a song about them, OK?

38:29.343 --> 38:31.536
Cool!

38:31.636 --> 38:33.417
- Mone!
- JEN: Oh, God.

38:34.473 --> 38:37.751
Check it out. This is the event
you've been waiting for.

38:37.851 --> 38:43.255
The Annual at Arizona Tech, a three-day
blowout to benefit the rain forest.

38:43.355 --> 38:48.634
There's gonna be, like, seminars
and lectures, and kegs and dudes galore.

38:48.735 --> 38:51.513
- Monique, we cannot go to this.
- Why not, pray tell?

38:51.613 --> 38:55.598
- Do the names Bud and Doyle ring a bell?
- A year's a long time to wait.

38:55.699 --> 38:58.811
- Do you know how old we'll be in a year?
- Old.

38:58.911 --> 39:01.855
- Real old.
- As in not spring chickens, over the hill...

39:01.955 --> 39:03.357
OK, OK, OK!

39:03.457 --> 39:07.110
Plus, did you see the pictures
of the chicks they're in there with?

39:07.210 --> 39:11.196
- They're hot.
- So? I trust Doyle.

39:11.297 --> 39:14.074
Listen, I love Bud
just as much as you love Doyle.

39:14.174 --> 39:18.672
But we gotta start thinking
about ourselves. They are.

39:19.554 --> 39:21.298
Oh... OK.

39:24.433 --> 39:29.843
- Now, pay attention, Soave Bolla.
- You're king, I'm peasant.

39:35.443 --> 39:37.804
Good afternoon, Petri dish.

39:38.654 --> 39:41.181
May-may.

39:41.281 --> 39:45.226
Perhaps you'd like to join us
for a little apéritif on the ridge.

39:45.326 --> 39:49.605
Allow me to present...
Chateau Squirly Stub.

39:49.705 --> 39:53.400
It's a bit plucky, a bit fruity perhaps,

39:53.500 --> 39:56.987
but it'll satisfy your palate,
especially with a big piece of pork.

39:57.087 --> 39:59.697
So that's what happened
to our fruit harvest?

39:59.798 --> 40:02.076
You're incorrigible.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.911
- I think they're into us.
- In a huge way.

40:06.011 --> 40:08.088
Mini tribal.

40:10.807 --> 40:12.883
- Marco!
- Cholo!

40:14.727 --> 40:16.803
- Marco!
- Cholo!

40:17.813 --> 40:20.720
Look. Biodegradable pineapple.

40:21.984 --> 40:25.678
Olivia, Romuli. Why don't you guys
join us for a little soak?

40:25.778 --> 40:29.599
That's not for bathing.
This is the artificial rain generator.

40:31.909 --> 40:35.479
- (FARTS)
- Whoo! It just got a little warmer.

40:35.579 --> 40:40.150
- There's nothing artificial about that.
- A little acid rain.

40:40.250 --> 40:45.488
They dominate a number of pivotal
processes occurring in the soil,

40:45.588 --> 40:47.990
and that's what makes this so exciting.

40:48.090 --> 40:51.951
Ladies and gentlemen,
here are Bud and Doyle.

40:52.051 --> 40:55.789
Doyle! What's the hot gossip
on the inside?

40:57.848 --> 41:00.584
I can't make any comment at this time,

41:00.684 --> 41:05.338
but all I know is, if I see one more
massive orgy, I'm movin' to Tibet.

41:05.438 --> 41:09.093
And Faulkner? Quit hogging the KY!

41:09.442 --> 41:11.260
Thirty-one,

41:11.360 --> 41:13.934
forty-two, sixty-nine,

41:14.988 --> 41:17.065
seventy-four...

41:21.786 --> 41:24.148
A hundred... a thousand!

41:24.997 --> 41:26.825
Here I come!

41:30.543 --> 41:32.862
Rombo! You gotta hide me.

41:32.962 --> 41:36.074
Not in here! You'll upset my bugs.

41:36.174 --> 41:37.373
Look out! It's...

41:39.343 --> 41:41.412
May I help you?

41:41.512 --> 41:44.289
- What are these guys?
- Well...

41:44.389 --> 41:47.545
They're two of the rarest
lepidoptera in the world.

41:47.975 --> 41:51.097
Leppard?
Didn't their drummer lose an arm?

41:52.814 --> 41:56.174
No. They're butterflies
from the Brazilian rain forest.

41:56.274 --> 41:58.844
So are you tryin'
to get 'em to start porking?

41:58.944 --> 42:03.806
Actually, yes. In nature, the chances
of these two finding each other,

42:03.906 --> 42:06.392
or "porking",

42:06.492 --> 42:08.936
are very remote.

42:09.036 --> 42:12.026
We hope to breed thousands here.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.649
Easy, Rombo.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.907
- Got ya!
- You gotta take me first!

42:32.348 --> 42:36.585
BOTH: Mothra! Come back, Mothra!
Please come back, Mothra!

42:36.685 --> 42:39.557
Lepidoptera!

42:39.980 --> 42:42.548
- Monique, should we be doing this?
- Yes!

42:42.648 --> 42:47.561
Jen, we are not doing anything wrong.
Besides, it's to save the rain forest.

42:52.323 --> 42:54.934
- Denise.
- Roach.

42:55.034 --> 42:57.111
One word: Raid.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.442
Hey, man.

43:03.542 --> 43:08.655
She thinks she's cool cos she hangs out
with Bud and Doyle's girlfriends.

43:08.755 --> 43:12.283
- She digs me, though.
- Are those Bud and Doyle's girlfriends?

43:12.383 --> 43:14.495
- Yeah.
- Put that back.

43:16.887 --> 43:19.623
Excuse me. Are you guys
done with those beers?

43:19.723 --> 43:23.584
Thanks, but we're having
too much fun sober.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.838
We were just going around
trying to collect empties and recycle 'em.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.465
- Oh! Well, here, take this.
- Take mine.

43:30.565 --> 43:35.303
- There's a lot of waste at these parties.
- That's awfully noble of you.

43:35.403 --> 43:37.764
It's just what we're compelled to do.

43:37.864 --> 43:42.851
We're having a fête to save the rain forest.
If you guys'd like to show your support...

43:42.951 --> 43:46.563
- It's not gonna be like this, is it?
- Not at all.

43:46.663 --> 43:49.607
- It's gonna be decent.
- It's at the quad.

43:49.707 --> 43:53.824
OK, we'll be there.
We'll see you tomorrow. Thanks.

43:56.296 --> 43:59.241
Noah, it's been a nonstop moronathon,

43:59.341 --> 44:04.161
and I did not dedicate my life to science
to baby-sit a couple of baboons.

44:04.261 --> 44:09.250
They eat like savages. At the rate
they're going, we'll run out of foodstuffs.

44:09.350 --> 44:13.003
They're going to ruin everything.

44:13.103 --> 44:16.131
- (GOAT BLEATS)
- Sliced it!

44:16.231 --> 44:19.049
Damn it, Billy.
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

44:19.149 --> 44:24.555
How am I supposed to hit a double birdie
with my bogey billy with a shower iron?!

44:24.655 --> 44:28.433
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends!

44:28.533 --> 44:32.354
- Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.
- Come on, Billy.

44:35.831 --> 44:37.907
Anatomically correct.

44:47.383 --> 44:50.077
Are you sure this flypaper's gonna work?

44:50.177 --> 44:54.998
Positive. It's really sticky. My dad
used it to line my playpen all the time.

44:55.098 --> 44:58.668
So you must have been stuck
in this position a lot.

44:58.768 --> 45:04.843
Help, Daddy! Please, get me down!
I wet my Huggies! Nobody loves me!

45:06.108 --> 45:07.884
OK! I'll shut up!

45:07.984 --> 45:11.596
CD-ROM! You gotta come with us quick.
We got a big surprise for ya.

45:11.696 --> 45:15.141
You've been diagnosed with Ebola,
and you're about to bleed out?

45:15.241 --> 45:19.770
No... Doyle's got a boner
and he wants to put it in your ear.

45:19.870 --> 45:23.565
No, there's a really big surprise.
We want you to come with us, please.

45:23.665 --> 45:27.193
If it's about Faulkner's third nipple,
don't bother. I know that.

45:27.293 --> 45:30.696
- Faulkner's got three nipples?
- Yeah.

45:30.796 --> 45:34.284
- Cool. Come on.
- Come on, let's go. Hurry.

45:35.133 --> 45:38.703
Rommy, we felt pretty awful
when we let all your bugs out.

45:38.803 --> 45:43.457
We promised we wouldn't get a wink
of sleep until we brought back every bug.

45:43.557 --> 45:45.800
You mean you found my bugs?

45:46.852 --> 45:48.003
Look!

45:48.103 --> 45:51.673
- Giant flypaper!
- I think we got all the little 'squitos,

45:51.773 --> 45:54.425
but there's still
a couple flapping right there.

45:54.525 --> 45:56.601
(ROMULUS SCREAMS)

45:59.321 --> 46:03.901
No! The horror! The pain!

46:08.120 --> 46:10.815
- (FAULKNER HUMMING)
- BUD: Come on!

46:10.915 --> 46:13.406
BUD AND DOYLE: We're sorry!

46:15.251 --> 46:18.405
What I wouldn't do
for just a Big Mac right now.

46:18.505 --> 46:21.031
Dude! Don't even say that word. (HUMS)

46:21.131 --> 46:27.246
Two all-beef patties, special sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, boy!

46:27.346 --> 46:29.505
On a sesame-seed bun.

46:31.599 --> 46:34.092
Bladder buster, no ice...

46:35.853 --> 46:39.887
- Breakfast burrito.
- I can't take it any more!

46:44.069 --> 46:46.804
I gotta get outta here.

46:46.904 --> 46:51.350
We should just relax a little before
Chaulkner chills out, don't you think?

46:51.450 --> 46:54.060
What's he gonna do? Expel us?

46:55.120 --> 46:58.690
You're right, Stub. You're right.
We own this place.

46:58.790 --> 47:01.910
- The whole world!
- The whole world.

47:03.836 --> 47:06.328
Hey. OK, turn into a table.

47:09.132 --> 47:13.416
Uppity-up. OK, you're pretty steady
on all fours. Get me up.

47:18.140 --> 47:19.837
Right down here.

47:20.892 --> 47:23.587
- Are you sure?
- Look, I can tell it.

47:23.687 --> 47:27.934
My beak has got a hunch,
like a Doberman pinscher.

47:39.701 --> 47:41.776
OK, the coast is clear.

47:44.830 --> 47:47.323
Stop... OK. Come down.

47:52.336 --> 47:54.413
(SNIFFS)

47:58.884 --> 48:01.828
- This is it. Open it up.
- Are you sure?

48:01.928 --> 48:04.291
- Bring it down.
- All right.

48:06.223 --> 48:08.584
Come on. Be careful.

48:08.684 --> 48:12.213
This is the one. I know
there's food in there. I can feel it.

48:12.313 --> 48:14.673
I can feel the aroma.

48:14.773 --> 48:17.383
- Ohh!
- Hey, Squirl?

48:17.484 --> 48:20.804
If we blow up,
it's been nice knowin' you, OK?

48:20.904 --> 48:23.182
OK. Open it.

48:25.199 --> 48:26.850
(BOTH YELL)

48:26.950 --> 48:28.446
Right?

48:29.912 --> 48:33.982
Didn't I tell you? Huh?
Who's the master? Who's the king?

48:34.082 --> 48:36.651
- Squirly!
- Who's the shrewdest?

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.875
All we found were these.

01:05:32.975 --> 01:05:35.585
They look like they've been chewed
through by a rat.

01:05:35.686 --> 01:05:38.546

I should have left you in charge.

01:05:44.777 --> 01:05:46.806
Well... maybe not.

01:05:47.862 --> 01:05:50.849
Mr Leaky, the damage is devastating.

01:05:50.949 --> 01:05:56.110
The toxins are way off the scale, and the
pH is acidic enough to digest a battery.

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:59.899
It took years to build this world,

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:04.068
and you geniuses
took only one month to destroy it!

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:07.030
God couldn't work at such a fast pace.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.990
I haven't seen devastation
of this magnitude

01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:13.294
since the Great Chipmunk Fire of '79.

01:06:15.387 --> 01:06:17.880
Go home! It's over.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:22.926

01:06:23.394 --> 01:06:26.052
- We've gotta fix it.
- We gotta.

01:06:29.107 --> 01:06:31.760
- Where are you guys headed?
- Out.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.678
Wait. You can't leave.

01:06:33.778 --> 01:06:36.013
- We're gonna need your help.
- For what?

01:06:36.113 --> 01:06:38.974
- To clean this place up.
- There's no point in staying.

01:06:39.074 --> 01:06:42.061
- The ecosystem is dead.
- It's not. It's just thrashed.

01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:47.106
The aim was life in a sealed environment
without contact from the outside world.

01:06:47.206 --> 01:06:50.484
The entire experiment
has been compromised.

01:06:50.584 --> 01:06:52.198

And you guys are gonna help us fix it.

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:13.129

it would be to make this place habitable?

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.803
Impossible's my nom de plum.

01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:27.445

01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:31.895
Come on, guys.
We gotta save the Bio-Dome.

01:07:34.998 --> 01:07:38.610
I've never quit anything in my whole life

01:07:46.509 --> 01:07:51.037
Well, maybe not masturbation. But give
me a break. It's the only thing I'm good at.

01:07:51.137 --> 01:07:55.249

01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:58.885
So come on! Who's a quitter?

01:08:02.106 --> 01:08:06.176
In five seconds, I'm gonna swallow

01:08:06.276 --> 01:08:08.554
you'd better do it now.

01:09:48.948 --> 01:09:52.894

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:56.273
- GIRL: Bud and Doyle, I love you!
- A standoff?

01:09:56.373 --> 01:09:59.567
There's Mr Leaky,
the project's principal investor.

GIRL: I studied chemistry in Sweden!

01:10:02.711 --> 01:10:07.157
All I can say right now
is that we're still negotiating.

01:10:07.257 --> 01:10:12.744
We're trying to keep them aware of the
dangerously low level of oxygen inside.

01:10:12.844 --> 01:10:13.913
That's all for now.

01:10:14.263 --> 01:10:17.124
COMPUTER: Homeostasis is 1% of normal.

01:10:17.224 --> 01:10:20.210
Animal life will terminate in 14 days.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:24.338
- 14 days. That's almost two weeks.
- I don't see how it can be done.

01:10:24.438 --> 01:10:27.800
Plant life must be revived
in order to produce oxygen for survival.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.890
Bingo! Revive plant life!

01:10:32.904 --> 01:10:37.892
Now the plants will get that island tan.
Photosynthesise, planties.

01:10:37.992 --> 01:10:42.146
Hopefully it'll also produce what
Doyle and I call "the beer-can effect".

01:10:42.246 --> 01:10:47.567
Heat inside stimulates condensation,
like the outside of a cold brew.

01:10:47.667 --> 01:10:51.321
That should increase the moisture
inside here and bring on a downpour.

01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:54.615
It'll work. All we gotta do
is filter the air.
