02:14.280 --> 02:15.360
Tom!

02:15.960 --> 02:18.960
- Get him!
- Tom, get back!

02:23.880 --> 02:25.840
- Hello, Brother.
- Hello.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
Hey, Brother, look at me!

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
Brother?

02:32.840 --> 02:33.800
Brother?!

02:34.120 --> 02:35.400
You all right, Brother?

02:35.880 --> 02:36.960
Brother?

02:37.360 --> 02:38.720
Oh, it's Tom, is it?

02:39.040 --> 02:42.840
Oh, yes, I'm just taking my leisure, Tom.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.000
Having a bit of a ponder.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.800
Having a snooze.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.080
Yes, I think I did doze off for a while.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.960
A combination of old Sol and old age.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.840
Are you cold, Tom?

02:59.840 --> 03:01.000
A bit, Brother.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.520
Mmm. The water's getting a
bit cold now for swimming.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.680
There won't be any more swims
this season, I'm afraid.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.880
Water can get so cold
it can freeze you to death.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.840
I'm freezing just here.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.920
- Oh, run along with you.
- See you, Brother.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.520
- Gotcha!
- You got balloon, Waite, yeah? - Yeah.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.200
Oh, you can beat me, can you?

03:31.280 --> 03:32.960
- Any time, Waite!
- Yeah?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.640
Yeah!

03:35.360 --> 03:36.800
All right.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.800
- Tell you what.
- What?

03:41.320 --> 03:46.080
The winner can do anything
he likes to the other. Right?

03:46.200 --> 03:46.800
Right.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.640
Anything! Right?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.640
Told you, Waite. It's easy.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.000
- Well?
- Well what?

04:00.520 --> 04:02.080
What are you going to do to me?

04:02.680 --> 04:04.680
Nothing! I won, that's enough!

04:05.760 --> 04:07.760
Come on, Scraggs,
there'll be no hot water left!

04:17.160 --> 04:18.519
For goodness's sake, Allen,
what do you think you're doing?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.800
I can't wash properly, Brother.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.800
Get them on. You're disgusting,
exposing yourself.
Where's your modesty?

04:25.200 --> 04:29.160
If you're to be a little brother of Mary,
you must learn your body is your
worst enemy, Allen.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.760
Avert your eyes, you lot!
The eyes are the windows of the soul
 and must be protected.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.920
You must be on guard against
all your senses at all times.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.120
You're preparing for a brotherhood
which requires you to
take stringent vows:...

04:42.000 --> 04:46.080
poverty, obedience, chastity. Hear that, Allen?

04:46.200 --> 04:51.560
Chastity! If you're to carry them out,
you must train yourselves now.

04:51.720 --> 04:56.160
Turn your backs on worldliness...
purge yourself of temporal temptations.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.520
Practice self-denial.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.320
Self-examination, self-discipline!

05:00.800 --> 05:03.880
So that you may be worthy of the
call to be among God's chosen few.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.280
Come on!

05:25.960 --> 05:28.560
- How long did it take you to read it?
- Two hours.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.520
You're kidding!

05:30.720 --> 05:31.920
Carry on, brave soul!

05:32.600 --> 05:37.000
The one night, I discovered that
Jan went with a man
behind the chicken houses.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.160
Oh, Walter! That could make us anything!

05:40.560 --> 05:41.400
Oh, yes!

05:41.560 --> 05:43.560
- Go on, Timmy!
- Come on!

05:43.760 --> 05:44.840
Come on, Timmy!

05:49.640 --> 05:52.520
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

05:53.800 --> 05:57.680
<i>The one with the waggedy tail.</i>

05:58.600 --> 06:01.680
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

06:03.160 --> 06:06.560
<i>I do hope that doggy's for sale!</i>

06:07.160 --> 06:10.720
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

06:12.120 --> 06:15.000
<i>The one with the waggedy tail.</i>

06:15.120 --> 06:16.000
Watch that!

06:16.280 --> 06:19.160
<i>How much is that doggy in the window?</i>

06:20.480 --> 06:23.760
<i>I do hope that doggy's for sale!</i>

06:59.400 --> 07:04.680
Amen.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.720
- Late again, James!
- A few more minutes...

07:32.120 --> 07:33.600
Punctuality is a virtue, Brother.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.800
- Good morning, Jim.
- Good morning.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.480
- How much longer until the boys' bell?
- Only twenty minutes.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
I'm afraid I'm a bit late.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.640
I've got to rush.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.720
He pissed his bed.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.000
- Pissed the bed!
- Pissed the bed!

09:12.000 --> 09:12.880
Wet the bed again, Allen?

09:14.560 --> 09:15.560
Yes, Brother.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.040
- You drink anything last night?
- No, Brother.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.520
Are you sure?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.600
Yes, Brother.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.760
Hurry up and fix them.
You'll be late for Mass again.

09:26.960 --> 09:27.760
Yes, Brother.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.920
Fifteen lates and four untidies.

10:36.920 --> 10:37.920
That must be a record.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.200
- Gee, you're in trouble.
- Shut up, Woody.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.960
Eggs and chops, please.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.720
Porridge again.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.840
Leave that... leave it!

11:12.240 --> 11:15.720
Let it set. You'll ruin anything, you scallywags!

11:16.520 --> 11:19.720
"Nor am I aware of it,"
replied the Lord with a sigh.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.160
"But I should like to know whether
you have any idea of the meaning
of those words...

11:25.360 --> 11:26.200
"punching ball?"

11:28.360 --> 11:31.320
"My knowledge of the English language
has not improved, Lord,"
replied Don Camillo...

11:32.440 --> 11:35.720
That gives us 2x,
and subtract those: x² from x²,...

11:35.800 --> 11:38.680
no remainder; 2x from 4x gives us 2x,...

11:38.800 --> 11:41.560
bring down the 4... Let's try that.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.560
Now 2 times x gives us 2x.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.120
Two times two, 4. Bring that across...

11:48.520 --> 11:51.720
Subtraction: x² from x²: no remainder.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.800
Allen. Allen!

11:57.400 --> 11:59.040
You're an idiot, Allen. What are you?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.640
What are you, Allen?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.320
An idiot, Brother.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.320
Righto, that's enough.
Come on, Westaway, you're no better.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.400
Right, page 41, everybody.
I want ten answers before the break.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.880
Come on, get to it.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.960
Damn you, damn you,
who the hell do you think you are?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.920
Running away like shit off a shovel.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.600
Come back, you wave of curly thick head.
Come back you good-for-nothing coward!

12:38.800 --> 12:41.080
Righto, righto, come on, back to work.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.680
Hey, Casey... what's the difference
between Allen and a crocodile?

13:01.960 --> 13:03.640
A crocodile likes his bed in a river,...

13:03.840 --> 13:06.040
and Allen likes a river in his bed!

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
Hiya, Tom. Hiya, mate!

13:08.920 --> 13:10.600
A right boy your are, hey?

13:13.600 --> 13:18.960
At your age, Smith, you may have noticed
certain changes
taking place in your body.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.840
Hair growing in places it wasn't before.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.720
You may have been having
what are called "wet dreams".

13:31.120 --> 13:33.520
- You know what wet dreams are?
- Yes, Brother.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.600
Have you experienced it?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.160
Now these changes
are called puberty. It's, um...

13:42.560 --> 13:44.600
nothing to worry about.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.320
It's just your body growing into manhood, and...

13:47.040 --> 13:49.600
you're experiencing for yourself
one of the miracles of life.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.600
What!?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.120
What's it about?

14:17.880 --> 14:18.640
Casey!

15:05.840 --> 15:07.320
Come on, hurry up.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.720
He wants to tell you
about what you've just been doing.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.680
Funny, Casey.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.480
Take your hands out of your pockets!

15:21.560 --> 15:23.680
I don't know who was the
more embarrassed, them or me.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.440
Have you finished with that, Brother?

15:27.640 --> 15:30.600
- I don't envy you, Brother.
- I don't think it's necessary.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.040
Neither do I. We're not Jesuits!

15:33.880 --> 15:35.160
Well, you're certainly not.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.360
If I'd wanted to go into theology,
they'd think
one ought to become a priest.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.920
Priests or Brothers... they're all the same.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.520
Slow eaters.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.600
My point is that if you dedicated yourself
to the religious life,
then that's what you should do.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.160
There's no one more dedicated than the Irish.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.640
But there's never been an Irish pope,
has there, Father?

15:54.760 --> 15:57.040
You're right, Mrs. Sullivan,
that's the luck of the Irish.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.000
- That's true.
- Luck of the Irish.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.800
I've got lots to learn about teaching yet.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.680
But you're teaching religion, also.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.960
That's a bit unfair, Frank.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.120
Not everyone who goes into business
wants to be managing director.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.120
Not every politician wants to be
Prime Minister, either.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.280
That's laziness, or lack of ambition.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.080
Oh, come on, Frank. I think
that all God would require of a man...

16:18.160 --> 16:20.360
is that he does what he feels
he can the best that he can.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.920
Here's your sweets, Brother.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.520
We've got more than enough to do anyway,...

16:24.720 --> 16:26.600
with university courses and study.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.080
And I've got more than enough
to do than stand around...

16:29.160 --> 16:30.760
all day listening to this nonsense.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.640
Have you finished with that, Brother?

16:35.640 --> 16:36.720
The mind should be fully occupied.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.600
Discipline of the mind is the
most important facet of religious life.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.880
- An undisciplined mind is...
- "The Devil's Playground"!

16:52.280 --> 16:54.360
Hey, Tom. Hey, Tom, you want to wrestle?

16:54.440 --> 16:55.920
- Not now, Scraggs.
- Oh, come on!

16:56.040 --> 16:57.120
Scraggs!

17:07.800 --> 17:08.800
You got hair yet?

17:10.000 --> 17:10.880
A little.

17:11.760 --> 17:12.560
So have I.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.040
Funny stuff... what's it for?

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
I don't know.

17:18.599 --> 17:22.079
You should see Tomkin...
I reckon he cuts it to make it grow faster.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.680
- Tomkin's warped.
- Tomkin's is going to fall off.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.960
He never leaves it alone, you know.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.520
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

17:32.040 --> 17:35.520
- Yeah.
- It keeps swelling up. It won't go away.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.000
- You should leave it alone,
- Oh, sure.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.680
- Hey... you seen Mahoney? - No.
- Oh, he'd beat Smith, I reckon.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.040
- You seen Mickey Smeall's.
- He wouldn't have any.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.320
He would, I reckon.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.720
That lad Thomas has, and he's only twelve.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.280
Maybe he would.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.760
I wouldn't mind seeing Smeall's.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.840
Hey... did you see
what Tierman did the other night?

18:05.560 --> 18:08.040
- No... what?
- Pretended he was sleep-walking.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.920
Nothing on. It was sticking right out.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
He threatened to climb into Johnson's bed!

18:15.800 --> 18:16.960
Really? Oh, wow!

18:23.280 --> 18:25.240
Hey... you want to wrestle?

18:25.760 --> 18:26.520
Huh?

18:28.720 --> 18:29.800
No... no.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.000
"Devil's Playground."

18:40.080 --> 18:42.880
I wish he'd play on somebody else's
ground and leave me alone.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.560
He ought to try Arnie for a change.
He wouldn't have a hope.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.720
That guy is so pure he makes me feel
like Saint Augustine
before he got religion.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.000
Saint Augustine... hope for me yet, Jim!

19:13.920 --> 19:16.600
Ah, there's Sebastian,
talking to young Allen again...

19:16.680 --> 19:18.480
confusing the poor little blighter.

19:19.880 --> 19:20.840
We ought to keep them apart.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.920
He's too impressionable, that Allen.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.600
He tries. He's got the right feelings.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.600
He's an untidy little bugger, though.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.680
He's constantly got an erection.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.840
Talk about sex rearing its ugly head!

19:40.160 --> 19:42.640
It just about rears him off the ground permanently.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.720
Sex.

19:58.200 --> 20:02.600
What about you, Jim? Young blood
in the prime of his pulsings?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.080
What tricks do you use to
keep your bolter at bay, huh?

20:12.360 --> 20:15.640
- Jim?
- Not just at the moment.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.120
Look at that bloody fanatic.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
What a prick!

20:33.800 --> 20:37.200
Pardon me, Brother.
Would you mind explaining
where you've been the past three days?

20:37.400 --> 20:41.680
Certainly, Brother Celian.
With three big-breasted blondes
in a brothel in Perth.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.560
Brother, really!

20:44.440 --> 20:45.720
Francine!

20:46.320 --> 20:47.520
That's beautiful.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.520
If you were Francine,
what would you be doing right now?

20:50.800 --> 20:57.680
I'd be crawling behind that hedge
like vermin, trying to catch you rats
imitating my mental deficiencies.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.960
It gets us all in various ways.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.600
It's not natural.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.320
It's not bloody natural.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.520
Chess, Victor?

21:21.520 --> 21:22.800
Mmm, chess!

22:01.080 --> 22:01.960
Thomas!

22:03.560 --> 22:04.440
Fitzpatrick!

22:06.360 --> 22:07.240
Turner!

22:07.840 --> 22:08.720
Reilly!

22:11.320 --> 22:12.280
Smith!

22:13.800 --> 22:14.680
Allen!

22:16.880 --> 22:17.760
Thompson!

22:19.360 --> 22:20.240
Westaway!

22:22.120 --> 22:23.000
Mahoney!

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
Good news?

22:31.080 --> 22:32.760
Yeah, great!

22:33.080 --> 22:33.960
I got good news, too.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.640
- I've been accepted into Fidelity.
- Have you!?

22:37.440 --> 22:38.920
- Yeah.
- Not much hope for me there.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.400
That's 'cause you're always late!

22:40.480 --> 22:42.120
I can't help it.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.840
- I'm supposed to be at the old job now!
- Hang on, I'll come with you!

22:44.960 --> 22:46.240
I've got something else to tell you.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.000
It's all based on Saint Nigella.
Hanson's is the founder.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.000
This order started the same way,
with just a handful of men.

22:55.880 --> 23:02.160
Hanson's wants it to be special:
dedicated only to prayer,
meditation, and penance.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.960
The mind will be the master.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.640
We need to... isolate pain.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.720
Sort of separate it from yourself.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.280
We want to achieve purification of the
body and the soul.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.760
To experience ecstasy, like Nigella did.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.760
The true religious experience.

23:23.560 --> 23:29.840
Discipline, control, concentration, and meditation.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.920
I've got to get going. Fitz will kill me.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.800
Keep it quiet. We don't want anyone to know yet.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.280
Most of them wouldn't understand.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.640
- See you there tonight, then!
- Righto!

23:41.440 --> 23:43.520
It's well, you're my mate...
nobody else'd put up with you.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.600
Keep the damned thing straight, will you?

23:48.680 --> 23:51.360
Don't push back! Just pull! Pull!

23:52.560 --> 23:53.560
That's it... pull!

23:54.440 --> 23:55.520
Get the rhythm... that's it, Tom!

23:57.040 --> 23:59.600
- We're not bleeding cutting anyway.
- Thank God for that!

24:00.320 --> 24:01.800
Just pull... that's it!

24:02.080 --> 24:03.960
What are you going on to?
Minding pigs? Gardening?

24:04.280 --> 24:06.440
- Haircutting.
- Haircutting? Count me out!

24:06.560 --> 24:08.120
Thought you'd be my first customer.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.120
Not on your life!

24:09.320 --> 24:10.480
Come on!

24:11.080 --> 24:11.960
Ah, we're through.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.560
What's the difference between a
good haircut and a bad haircut?

24:14.760 --> 24:16.840
Yeah, I know... two weeks!

24:17.720 --> 24:19.520
Two weeks too cold!

24:21.400 --> 24:23.680
Hey, listen... while I think of it:...

24:23.880 --> 24:25.880
don't get tangled up
with that Turner bloke, either.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.360
He's nuts, do you hear me?

24:27.640 --> 24:29.800
Go on, that's enough.
Nick off to the lounge {????}.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.200
- Thanks, Fitz.
- See you later.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.200
See you, Fitz.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.680
Come on, you can do better than that! Come on!

24:36.560 --> 24:37.560
- Bring it over here.
- Come on, bring it back!

24:40.440 --> 24:41.640
Play the ball, not the boy!

24:43.240 --> 24:45.520
Allen... to left wing!

24:46.200 --> 24:49.080
- You pigheaded idiot!
- Back me up!

24:49.160 --> 24:50.720
Come on, come on, come on.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.640
Oh, come on, help me.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.720
Casey, over here!

25:14.120 --> 25:15.920
You all right, mate?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.600
Hey, you rat, Allen!

25:24.920 --> 25:27.680
Rules are rules
and they've been rules for generations.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.560
- Discipline of mind, body, and soul...
- It hasn't happened in ordinary colleges.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.440
This is NOT an ordinary college.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.520
The fact that the boys always
have to keep their bodies covered,
even in the shower...

25:41.120 --> 25:42.800
that's still unhealthy and unjust.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.760
Oh, come on. I don't believe that.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.640
It's not natural,
it must breed sick attitudes.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.320
You know, they've already made the
dictionary a dirty book.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.920
That's 18 years ago.
It certainly wasn't me.

26:05.320 --> 26:09.680
It certainly is. A harmless bit of titillation
is transformed into pornography.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.080
They have smutty minds.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.960
Well, they're undergoing immense
physiological changes.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.120
Strange things are happening
as far as they're concerned.

26:20.040 --> 26:20.800
Bad luck, Brother.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.680
Obviously they are more
than conscious of sex.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.760
Because that's what it's all about!

26:28.880 --> 26:30.760
Sexual awakening... ripening!

26:31.160 --> 26:33.040
- Oh, great shot!
- God's on your side.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.800
And they want to know
if it's happening to others.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.680
- How can they?
- It's all so secretive, all covered up.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.160
This bit or that... it's unnatural.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.960
Ah, well... it's a breeding ground
for bloody poofters.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.520
You've been there, Frank, we all have.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.520
It's so stupid.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.240
It makes it all so unnecessarily important.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.600
Come on, Jim, you've got a setup.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.840
Well, change the rules.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.520
But they weren't made for no reason.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.120
Break the discipline with masturbation.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.000
Don't tell me you don't think
they masturbate now, Frank?

27:06.280 --> 27:08.720
They shouldn't be here
if they can't control themselves.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.840
We should be tougher...
keep their minds occupied.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.840
Teach them self-discipline...
that's what the rules are for!

27:15.720 --> 27:18.600
Discipline, training, to resist temptation.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.680
I think I'm going to need self-discipline
to get out of this one.

27:24.360 --> 27:28.680
- Pray, Brother, pray.
- What's so wrong with masturbation, anyway?

27:29.360 --> 27:32.760
If you don't do it yourself, well,
it comes out of its own accord.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.720
You know, for years I fought against it.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.720
All you learn is to hate your body.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.800
You know, we're old men.
Our religion is based on love.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.880
We spend the time hating ourselves.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.160
And another thing...
what if God isn't there? Heh?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.040
We'll hate ourselves then, won't we?

28:02.840 --> 28:03.800
Anybody care for a game of snooker?

28:06.800 --> 28:09.400
- There we are, Brothers!
- Dedicated to the power of prayer.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.880
Harder!

28:36.160 --> 28:37.440
Harder!

28:42.360 --> 28:44.640
Welcome to our purification, Tom!

28:45.760 --> 28:48.600
Come... bare your despicable body!

28:49.920 --> 28:51.800
Let us beat out your evils!

28:52.800 --> 28:54.160
Transcend pain with us...

28:54.400 --> 28:56.560
to a true spiritual love!

28:57.440 --> 28:58.640
You're bloody mad!

28:58.720 --> 29:00.000
Stop him, Brothers! Quick!

29:11.320 --> 29:13.520
- You better stop, Allen
- Don't tell anyone, Allen!

29:13.600 --> 29:15.080
- Head him off!
- Stop, Allen!

29:21.600 --> 29:22.640
- Secrecy {????}, Allen.
- Promise, Allen!

29:22.760 --> 29:26.120
Or we'll cover you in birds' blood.
Secrecy, Allen! Promise!

29:26.440 --> 29:27.720
- Someone's coming!
- Run!

29:28.320 --> 29:29.400
What's all the noise here?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.680
What happened to you? You all right?

29:33.800 --> 29:38.080
Oh, not them! I told you to stay away
from those fanatics, didn't I?

29:38.760 --> 29:41.440
They ought to be stopped
before they go too far. They're mad!

29:43.640 --> 29:45.440
Haven't got much to say
for yourself, have you?

29:45.640 --> 29:47.400
You nut! Come on.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.080
One! Two! Three!

29:55.000 --> 29:56.480
That's what I should do to you.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.520
The your body would be
just like your brain... frozen solid!

29:59.680 --> 30:00.720
Like yours, you mean!

30:02.240 --> 30:06.400
Wouldn't want to fall in.
Wouldn't last thirty seconds in there!

30:23.520 --> 30:25.360
Do you ever worry about dying, Fitz?

30:26.800 --> 30:27.680
No.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.840
I hope I die in a state of grace.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.520
You? State of grace?

30:36.840 --> 30:38.480
Probably die playing with yourself.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.800
- Quit it, Fitz.
- Straight to hell!

30:41.000 --> 30:42.280
Fitz!

30:42.560 --> 30:43.560
Oh, you'll be all right, mate.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.520
You're practically an angel, you're so holy.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.320
You're always in chapel.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.800
I don't know how you do it.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.160
I get sore knees and run out of words.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.560
There's only so much you can say
to someone who's not around at the time.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.640
What do you do? Say the Rosary?

31:05.520 --> 31:09.000
No... just think.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.360
It's quiet. I think.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.960
Tell Him my problems. Ask His help.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.440
Tell Him my doubts.
Do you ever doubt, Fitz?

31:27.240 --> 31:28.520
Sometimes.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.880
Hey, Scallan's gone, you know?

31:35.280 --> 31:36.760
Scallan? When?

31:37.160 --> 31:40.480
Today. Celian called him
out of class this morning.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.240
Told him to take his pin,
and that was that.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.600
Whoa. What'd he do?

31:44.920 --> 31:46.000
Don't know.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.360
He was a great bloke, though.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.960
- Pretty clean, too.
- Must have been something.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.720
We'll never know.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.720
It's really bad...
no explanations, no goodbyes.

31:58.520 --> 32:02.480
- Just take your pin.
- Maybe he chucked it in?

32:02.800 --> 32:03.560
Lost his vocation.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.560
- They'll never tell.
- Maybe he had trouble at home.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.520
Maybe. They should be able to tell us.
We're not idiots.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.000
Probably think it'll make us doubt.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Yeah... cut out the rotten fruit
before it contaminates the rest.

32:17.200 --> 32:17.960
Load of rubbish.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.640
Must think our vocations are pretty weak!

32:23.360 --> 32:24.440
Just take your pin.

32:29.040 --> 32:29.920
Yeah.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.200
Quickly and quietly! Quickly and quietly!

32:35.200 --> 32:36.280
Move on quickly.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.560
- Save us a place, Mick.
- Haven't got a chance, Tom.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.040
Sorry, Turner. Hot water bottles aren't that hot.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.400
I put boiling water in it.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.400
Boiling water?

33:22.880 --> 33:24.480
Boy, it would burn your leg off.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.760
Didn't feel a thing.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.320
- I transcended it.
- Ten minutes?

33:28.640 --> 33:30.920
You kept your leg on it for ten minutes?

33:31.320 --> 33:32.480
Yeah... look!

33:33.480 --> 33:35.280
God, brother, you're mad!

33:35.560 --> 33:38.840
Perfect meditation.
With this sort of concentration,
I could achieve any spiritual state.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.520
Ecstasy.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.680
- Now I'll see if I can endure cold.
- Tom!

33:43.400 --> 33:44.360
Brother wants to see me.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.720
Be careful of following around fanatics.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.520
You keep your innocence, Tom.
Be true to yourself.

33:58.400 --> 34:03.480
You've got a smile that'll take you
half way around the world, Tom.
Don't you lose it!

34:15.679 --> 34:16.840
Slow down... you'll kill us.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.719
Well, we don't want to miss the bounce!

34:19.120 --> 34:20.520
We only get to the footie
four times a year.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.280
- Tom at full forward?
- You bet!

34:24.400 --> 34:28.159
- Great!
- I can't wait to get lost among that crowd!

34:28.719 --> 34:29.960
Normal humans again.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.719
Well, are you normal?

34:32.040 --> 34:33.320
- Freak!
- Well, almost!

34:36.320 --> 34:37.679
Hey, why don't you join us, Frank?

34:37.800 --> 34:41.679
Yeah, it'll do you good.
Have a bit of a yell, let off some steam!

34:41.760 --> 34:42.679
Perfect.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.639
I'm going to have a nice quiet day.

34:44.760 --> 34:46.040
There's a great exhibition at the museum.

34:46.840 --> 34:50.000
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll pick you up
at the post office, will we?

34:50.400 --> 34:51.400
Fine.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.560
What about six?

34:52.880 --> 34:55.040
Give or take an hour or two, knowing you.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.720
- Any chance of you being served there?
- Not much!

35:00.720 --> 35:01.840
Here, Jim!

35:04.120 --> 35:06.800
- Can't you see that? You bloody mad?
- Get off it. You're mad!

35:08.320 --> 35:09.400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.880
- Kick it!
- Get rid of it!

35:12.680 --> 35:14.360
Great! Great play!

35:30.440 --> 35:32.120
Hey, hey, get off him, will you?

35:45.240 --> 35:47.600
Pride, they say, Brother,
comes before the fall.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.400
I think he's hurt more than his pride.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.760
Come on, let's move it!

35:58.360 --> 36:00.360
Oh, wow, look at those!

36:01.560 --> 36:03.840
- Would she be shaved?
- I think it's painted out.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.520
Sure, it would be underneath, wouldn't it?

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
Stop!

36:09.600 --> 36:11.160
Oh, you little bastard, Allen!

36:12.680 --> 36:14.560
- Give us my ball.
- Piss off!

36:15.560 --> 36:16.520
- Give us my ball.
- Piss off!

36:16.720 --> 36:18.000
Oh, give it to him, Westy.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.600
Give us my ball.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.560
Righto. Get it, Piss-the-bed!

36:28.160 --> 36:29.440
- I've got it all worked out.
- What?

36:29.840 --> 36:30.840
The endurance to cold.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.000
The lake... at night!

36:34.800 --> 36:36.000
Freezing!

39:00.680 --> 39:01.760
What a game, hey!

39:03.160 --> 39:05.840
The best. It was brilliant!

39:06.640 --> 39:07.840
He's the best rover in the league!

39:10.720 --> 39:13.520
Hey. Cop that!

39:18.920 --> 39:20.480
Would you like to...

39:25.800 --> 39:27.080
Give us a refill, thanks, man.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.360
Oh, this is doing me good!
Doing me good!

39:49.560 --> 39:50.720
Here's what we need.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.720
Not bad in here, is it?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.400
Had enough beers, Madge?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.560
They killed them today. Really killed them.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.760
Yeah... great match.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.840
They even beat the umpire.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.720
Come on, Jim.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.400
Let's see how we came.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.760
Come on, what are you scared of?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.640
They won't bite.

40:33.440 --> 40:34.640
Hi, girls.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.520
Oh! Hi, handsome.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.600
Mind if I join you?

40:40.000 --> 40:41.760
Please do.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.360
What about your pretty friend? He shy?

40:51.160 --> 40:52.320
A bit, yeah!

40:52.720 --> 40:54.520
- Hey, come on, Jim.
- Yeah, come on, Jim.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.920
It's all right, mate, come on.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.080
We won't eat you.

41:05.560 --> 41:06.720
Hey, Jim!

41:07.240 --> 41:10.560
I need... I need some air.
I'll see you in the car.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.600
Can't take it, these young blokes.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.000
Drink?

41:31.400 --> 41:32.960
Well... what do you girls do for a living?

41:33.080 --> 41:35.160
Oh, we work around the
corner in the factory.

41:35.440 --> 41:38.720
I'm a secretary. Madge here's in accounts.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.800
It's pretty boring.

41:42.120 --> 41:47.080
- Oh?
- We'd much rather just live it up a bit.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.160
Have a bit of fun.

41:49.680 --> 41:50.960
Yeah... a bit of fun.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.720
A few laughs, a few drinks.
Meet some interesting fellows.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.120
And what do you do
with yourself all week?

42:03.520 --> 42:04.880
I'm a schoolteacher.

42:05.200 --> 42:09.680
Oh, so you'd need a
bit of fun yourself, then.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.240
Yeah.

42:11.960 --> 42:12.840
Yeah, sure.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.800
How do you... what do you...

42:35.200 --> 42:36.400
Well, it's about time.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.560
God, Jim, they were serious.
They nearly had me.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.440
It's the last time, Jim. I promise.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.720
It's the last time.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.720
Frank will be furious.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.280
It must be really late.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.040
- Sober up.
- Yeah, OK.

42:50.560 --> 42:55.440
OK. That was too close. It was close, Jim.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.720
Slow down, Vic!

43:16.240 --> 43:17.640
Look out, you'll kill us!

43:32.840 --> 43:36.520
We're not too bad.
A few bruises, the back's a bit sore.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.200
The car must be a mess.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.680
Oh, yeah, you should see it.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.640
It's going to cost us a fortune, I'm afraid.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.320
You don't look too good.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.800
That's funny... I feel wonderful.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.800
How are the others?

43:51.400 --> 43:55.880
Well, Brother James is all right.
Francine's rather badly shaken up,
I'm afraid.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.760
We saw him go inside a minute ago.
He looked a bit strange. Isn't he...

43:58.840 --> 44:00.720
He probably didn't see us, Dear.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.200
Probably.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.680
- Hi Mom, hi Dad!
- Here's Tom. Well, I better leave you.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.560
Goodbye, Brother.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.840
Have a nice stay, Mrs. Allen.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.240
Thank you.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.800
- How about this lot.
- Hi, Tom.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.600
By golly, he's grown, hasn't he?

44:13.600 --> 44:14.600
How are you?

44:15.600 --> 44:16.680
What do you think
about your Mum staying, eh?

44:17.480 --> 44:19.680
- That be good?
- I'll say. Two weeks.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.600
It's more than a guest house.
You'll have to have a look at it.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.000
It'll do you good. Won't it, Dick?

44:24.880 --> 44:27.680
Auntie Mary's due to have a baby soon.
It might be twins.

44:27.880 --> 44:31.560
- Twins? Gee.
- They think so. She's rather large.

44:31.640 --> 44:32.560
Isn't she, Dick?

44:32.640 --> 44:33.600
Like a mountain!

44:34.600 --> 44:36.080
Here, Dear, have one of these,
something to keep you going.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.960
- I got a new bike.
- Yeah, the lucky devil!

44:39.480 --> 44:40.840
Have you? A newie?

44:41.760 --> 44:44.160
No, it's Stevie's old one, I'll fix it up.

44:49.120 --> 44:57.600
<i>Tell me I may always dance
The anniversary waltz with you.</i>

44:58.320 --> 45:07.200
<i>Tell me this is real romance
An anniversary dream come true.</i>

45:07.600 --> 45:18.560
<i>Let this be the answer to our future years
Through millions of smiles
and a few little tears.</i>

45:18.960 --> 45:29.560
<i>May I always listen to
the anniversary waltz with you.</i>

45:33.760 --> 45:34.920
God, I'm in trouble again!

45:39.680 --> 45:44.600
C = (F - 32) x 5/9

45:44.800 --> 45:47.600
He steeped himself in the
rationalism of the Enlightenment...

45:47.680 --> 45:49.480
and the romantic philosophy of Rousseau.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.640
And you'll note that it starts in a
circle at the top...

45:52.760 --> 45:54.440
those of you who listen to me
in French class...

45:54.520 --> 45:58.000
will know it's called a cirque.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.600
This is Bryan Anderson.
Bryan just started in accountancy.

46:20.680 --> 46:21.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.240
And this is Nigel Ryan.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.840
- Nigel's an actor.
- A resting actor.

46:25.920 --> 46:26.840
- Hello.
- Hello.

46:27.320 --> 46:30.800
- And over here, Miss Doyle...
- Hello.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.480
and Miss Weatherhead.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.760
Hello. He's handsome, isn't he?

46:36.160 --> 46:38.040
Take after his father?

46:38.240 --> 46:39.120
Of course.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.120
Miss Doyle and Miss Weatherhead
are in charge of the girls...

46:42.200 --> 46:45.880
- who are here on the Christian...
- Christian Fellowship Association.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.760
Quite a job they have, too.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.640
- You know what you've been
missing out on? - Quit it, Lynnette!

47:16.840 --> 47:17.840
I think so.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.120
Aren't you a bit young to know?

47:19.320 --> 47:20.800
I'm in fourth form.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.480
- Just because you're bright doesn't mean
to say you know everything! - Quit it, Lynnette!

47:23.840 --> 47:24.720
You're only 13.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.200
Well, it's better you than me,
that's all I can say.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.800
You won't be able to get married,
have a family.

47:31.400 --> 47:33.680
There's a lot more to life than that, too!

47:35.160 --> 47:36.640
Vocation is a special thing.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.720
It's hard to explain.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.600
Not many people are so lucky.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.480
Lynnette!

47:45.800 --> 47:47.560
- Lucky!
- Hang on, Nigel.

47:48.880 --> 47:51.840
- How did you get your vocation?
- Did God send you a letter or something?

47:54.240 --> 47:55.440
Sorry.

47:55.920 --> 47:59.320
It was during Benediction. It's hard to describe.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.600
I sort of got carried away...

48:03.800 --> 48:05.680
- The atmosphere.
- Yeah.

48:07.440 --> 48:09.920
- Once removed from God.
- One thing about the Catholics,
you know...

48:10.040 --> 48:11.600
their services are pure theater.

48:12.120 --> 48:14.200
- Wonderful.
- You're a nut, Nigel.

48:15.480 --> 48:16.360
True.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.760
Lynette, you've had it...
I'm going to get you now!

48:19.040 --> 48:20.280
Girls!

48:40.040 --> 48:41.640
I'm going to get you!

48:44.320 --> 48:45.400
Given up, have you?

48:47.800 --> 48:49.080
It's so high.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.960
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

49:34.760 --> 49:42.360
<i>It's whispered to me that
you're wonderful, beautiful, heavenly</i>

49:42.440 --> 49:44.520
- <i>and that you're...</i>
- Are you singing, Allen?

49:44.640 --> 49:46.320
- Yes. Brother.
- I can't hear you.

49:47.720 --> 49:48.880
My voice has dropped, Brother.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.560
Are you sure you're not
dropping it deliberately?

49:53.080 --> 49:54.240
Yes, Brother.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.520
Yeah, well, very well, right.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.320
Well take it from the
third and fourth lines, boys.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.080
Ready? One, two, three:...

50:00.480 --> 50:04.160
<i>It's whispered...</i>
Oh, come on, come on,
why aren't you singing now?

50:04.480 --> 50:06.560
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning, Father.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.720
I'm sorry, Father. I didn't see you there.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.000
Welcome back!

50:10.200 --> 50:11.280
It's good to be back, Brother!

50:12.200 --> 50:13.760
Well, all ready for the retreat, boys?

50:14.280 --> 50:15.160
Yes, Father.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.920
A retreat is a time for meditation.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.920
The silence isn't a hardship,
penance, it has a purpose...

50:23.000 --> 50:25.600
it's there to rid you of all distractions.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.960
So that you can think and concentrate.

50:28.480 --> 50:31.440
So that you can examine
yourselves... thoroughly.

50:32.160 --> 50:34.440
Three days' silence isn't a long time...

50:34.520 --> 50:35.720
when you consider the benefits.

50:37.200 --> 50:41.400
In the days before the retreat,
I'll be available to talk to.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.680
As you can see,
I'm quite a friendly chap,...

50:44.760 --> 50:46.840
with quite broad shoulders.

50:48.040 --> 50:51.720
If there's anyone who has any problem
he'd like to speak to me about...

50:51.920 --> 50:52.920
feel free.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.600
I find it hard sometimes, Father.

51:01.200 --> 51:04.480
I'm always in trouble for being late.
Being untidy.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.240
But you're trying, aren't you, Tom?

51:06.440 --> 51:07.640
I am trying.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.720
I'd like to make this a
vale to Our Lady if I can.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.880
Well, trying's the important thing.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.160
Keep trying, and pray to God.

51:15.480 --> 51:16.760
He'll help you.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.640
I spend a lot of time in chapel, Father.

51:18.720 --> 51:20.720
I noticed that, Tom, that's good.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.680
Anything else worrying you?

51:23.800 --> 51:27.560
Any problem you think
you can't talk to anyone about?

51:28.760 --> 51:30.040
No. Not really.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.720
You don't sound sure.

51:33.720 --> 51:36.000
You can talk to me, you know,
that's what I'm here for.

51:36.520 --> 51:37.600
To help.

51:39.000 --> 51:39.920
Nothing, really.

51:42.280 --> 51:45.640
Do you have any...
temptations you find hard to handle?

51:48.760 --> 51:51.720
- Bad thoughts, say?
- No more than normal, Father.

51:55.240 --> 51:59.680
Do you have trouble with...
playing with yourself?

52:02.520 --> 52:03.600
No, Father.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.280
That's good.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.640
I believe you have a
problem with bedwetting.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.520
I've got something here that might help.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.600
It's water from the shrine at Lourdes.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.280
Lourdes water?

52:20.800 --> 52:21.680
Really?

52:24.880 --> 52:27.560
At the invitation of Brother Gérard,...

52:31.160 --> 52:32.600
- With red hair?
- That's right!

52:32.760 --> 52:35.560
Extraordinary! I've known him for years.
I was stationed with him...

52:36.560 --> 52:38.840
...six years ago.
He runs a marvelous community.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.720
Yes, you wouldn't get away
with much with him, though.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.800
He's as tough as nails.

52:43.920 --> 52:44.880
He's got a great sense of humor, though.

52:46.880 --> 52:49.840
- Remarkable man.
- Yes, he certainly is.

52:51.760 --> 52:53.240
He's the reason I became a Brother.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.520
- Really?
- He used to teach me
when I was at school.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.800
I thought he was wonderful.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.280
You're a bit edgy tonight, Frank.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.040
My word, I'm edgy.
I very nearly lost my life
because of you and your weakness.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.600
An experience I could
well have done without.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.120
- Oh, let's not go through all that again...
- Excuse me...

53:12.400 --> 53:14.000
But we were having a pleasant evening!

53:14.880 --> 53:18.080
I don't think Father Marshall should be
subjected to our family squabbles.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.040
Sorry.

53:21.280 --> 53:24.440
Please, please, treat me as one
of the family. I enjoy it.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.520
I should think so, too. I mean, where else
could you find such wonderful company?

53:27.840 --> 53:29.080
Intellectual, witty, talented...

53:31.800 --> 53:33.880
That was a rather nice piece
you were playing then, Brother.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.440
Perhaps Father Marshall
would like to hear some more?

53:37.160 --> 53:39.400
- Marvelous!
- Yes, more please!

53:57.560 --> 53:58.520
How are the studies, James?

54:00.720 --> 54:02.320
Oh, managing.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.480
Managing!? He loves it!

54:05.280 --> 54:06.640
He's going to do very well, I think.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.520
You really love all this...
brotherhood, don't you?

54:18.040 --> 54:18.920
Yes, I do.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.280
I belong here.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.280
Part of a community.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.560
Oh, I've got my weaknesses.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.240
As he knows.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.920
There's a lot here that troubles me.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.520
A lot of things I don't agree with, but...

54:44.720 --> 54:46.560
I'm a grass reed... I'll go with it.

54:48.280 --> 54:49.960
Hopefully, I can affect
some changes for the good.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.560
I'm good with the boys.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.600
I don't know...
it's a pretty hard thing to explain, really.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.880
- I'm off to bed. Good night.
- Good night, Brother.

55:17.320 --> 55:19.680
Maybe it's because
we're one big happy family.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.080
Hey, Tom. Would you like to go
for a walk with us girls?

55:28.560 --> 55:29.440
Do you mind, Mom?

55:29.560 --> 55:30.840
No, go on... the fresh air will do you good!

55:30.920 --> 55:33.520
Great, see you. Bryan, Nigel?

55:33.800 --> 55:36.680
I'm just about to move
in for the big destroy.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.160
Oh, yeah?

55:56.960 --> 55:58.840
Hey... it's starting to rain!

55:59.960 --> 56:01.320
We'll get saturated!

56:01.440 --> 56:02.720
Let's head for that tree over there.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.080
Come on!

56:05.680 --> 56:08.080
It beats drowning. It's great, isn't it?

56:08.160 --> 56:09.240
Yeah, it's great!

56:11.960 --> 56:13.440
It's coming down in buckets.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.920
Did you get very wet?

56:15.000 --> 56:16.080
A bit.

56:16.480 --> 56:17.760
- You cold?
- A bit.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.560
I'm leaving tomorrow.

56:26.840 --> 56:27.720
I know.

56:30.640 --> 56:31.600
Will you write to me?

56:32.920 --> 56:34.000
Do you want me to?

56:34.480 --> 56:36.760
- Please!
- OK.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.640
I'm not a very good letter writer, though.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.520
- I am.
- OK.

56:44.800 --> 56:46.680
Well, you'd better pretend
you're my cousin when you write.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.880
They check all our letters.

56:50.360 --> 56:51.560
- Would you rather I...
- No!

56:52.360 --> 56:53.920
Please write.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.720
- Bye, Dad.
- See you.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.680
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, son.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.560
Bye-bye, son. See you soon.

57:04.680 --> 57:07.160
- Bye, Tom. Bye.
- Be good!

58:00.440 --> 58:02.920
Lourdes water? Really? Show me?

58:08.320 --> 58:09.680
Looks just ordinary water to me.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.680
- Father Marshall gave it to me.
- What for?

58:13.800 --> 58:14.880
To cure my problem.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.560
What, whacking off?

58:17.840 --> 58:18.840
Wetting the bed.

58:19.680 --> 58:22.520
- What do you do?
- Put a drop on your tongue every night...

58:22.600 --> 58:24.400
- and say a prayer to Our Lady...
- On your tongue?

58:25.680 --> 58:29.720
You should put it on your dick.
Stop all the pissing and the pulling!

58:30.080 --> 58:30.960
Shut up, Fitz!

58:31.560 --> 58:32.640
The weird and the whacking...

58:32.720 --> 58:35.000
- Quit it, Fitz!
- Flowing and the blowing...

58:36.320 --> 58:41.000
Now quit making that row.
Now get on with it. Where's the milk?

58:41.400 --> 58:43.760
Look at those peelings, all over the place!

58:45.960 --> 58:48.160
You two boys,
you can't do anything right!

58:52.040 --> 58:53.160
Keep still.

58:53.520 --> 58:54.400
This better be good, Allen.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.600
Don't worry, it's beautiful.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.680
You're the first solo,
it's got to be beautiful.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.360
- Ouch!
- Sorry, forgot to keep the clippers going.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.520
No nicks, right?

59:05.120 --> 59:07.120
There was a little.
I'm fixing up, it won't be long.

59:08.320 --> 59:10.200
Take your time,
it's only been half an hour.

59:10.480 --> 59:11.480
Keep still.

59:14.160 --> 59:16.960
There! Perfectly straight! No nicks, look!

59:17.840 --> 59:20.320
- It's beautiful!
- Oh, hell, Allen!

59:25.720 --> 59:30.720
Without exception, death will come
to each and every one of us.

59:31.920 --> 59:36.000
The clods of earth will rattle
on each of our coffins.

59:37.280 --> 59:42.280
The body we pamper
will become a city of corruption.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.440
A horror under the earth.

59:46.560 --> 59:50.520
Our own mothers
could not bear to look upon it.

59:51.640 --> 59:57.520
If we are saved, our bodies will rise again,
free and glorious, when Christ comes.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.960
But if we lose our battle with temptation,

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.560
we know what our agony will be.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:14.640
Forever more, we shall be awash
in the burning rivers of the dead.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:21.000
Forever more, the stench of hell,
of the rotting flesh of the damned...

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.560
will fill our nostrils.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:30.640
Forever more, our ears will resound
with the screams of the tormented.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.920
Forever more, our pain will be
like the pain of a man
tied down, unable to move,

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.600
while one fiery worm eats at his vitals.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.760
The man screams for unconsciousness,

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.360
but there is no unconsciousness in hell.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.840
The worm eats and eats
and its work will never finish,

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.000
but continues forever more.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.880
And what does that forever more mean?

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.040
Imagine a sphere of metal,
vast as the sun.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.920
Imagine that once
every ten thousand years...

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.520
a sparrow should visit it
and brush it with its wings.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.880
When that ball
had been worn to nothing...

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.600
we would still be in hell!

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.440
We would still be the howling damned...

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.520
who do not see God's face!

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.080
The retreat has begun.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.760
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It is one week since my confession.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.360
- Yes...
- Father, I have...

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.840
Yes, come on, lad.
You don't have to be shy with me.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.520
- It's not easy.
- Well, what's the matter?

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.280
Have you been
abusing yourself, have you?

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.960
No good trying to hide it if you have.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.560
- It's more than that, Father.
- Oh, don't be so ridiculous, lad.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.840
Whatever it is,
tell me and have done with it.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.920
I... I've made 17 bad confessions
and 119 bad communions.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
You what? How could you?

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.680
You're imagining it!

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.640
Stop wasting my time with your
silly scruples and let's get on with it.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.840
It's not scruples, Father.
I've been abusing myself
and I haven't confessed it.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.520
Rubbish. What are you
talking about? Why?

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.080
Because I'm scared, Father.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.960
Scared? Scared of what?

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.840
Scared of you, Father.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.440
Scared of me? Why?

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.000
Rubbish! How often do these acts occur?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.480
- Two or three times...
- Two or three times a week?

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.080
You better get ahold of yourself, me lad!

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.560
- A day, Father.
- A day?

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.520
You're wasting my time.
You're too old for this sort of nonsense.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.200
I'm going to absolve you now.
And don't you be coming in
here with such nonsense again!

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.680
Scared of me, indeed!

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.880
You'll be saying three decades of the
Rosary as penance,

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.160
and praying to Our Lady
to keep you pure.
And stop telling me lies!

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.920
Say the Act of Contrition now,
and be off with you!

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:14.800
Quick!

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.040
Oh, no, I'm soaking wet!

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.680
I am sure you all have a great future
ahead of you in the religious life.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.560
If you've used the last three days
wisely and well...

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.120
then the retreat should have been of
real value to you.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.720
It should have helped you gain
confidence in yourself...

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.600
and strength in your vocation.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.680
But it must not end there, of course.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.840
That's about all.
I've enjoyed being with you.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.640
I'd give my right arm to stay longer.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.720
By the way, boys,
if any of you become missionaries,

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.880
never say that to a cannibal.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.960
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.640
Bless us, oh Lord, and these Thy gifts
which of Thy bounty we are about
to receive. Through Christ our Lord.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.520
Amen!!

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.600
- Yes, Tom?
- Would it be all right
if I drank tonight, Brother?

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.680
You haven't shown
any improvement at all.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.560
The doctor says it doesn't help.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.560
It makes it worse.
It makes me more conscious...

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.320
- We've been through all that.
- But it's a feast.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.800
- The others will think I'm stupid
if I can't... - Offer it up
as an extra-special penance, Tom.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.680
- But, Brother...
- Off you go now.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.960
Tom! That way.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.640
- Have a drink, mate.
- I'd better not.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.040
James isn't looking.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.800
Thanks anyway, Fitz.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.000
I can't. I bloody can't.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.680
Come on, Tom. Have some!

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.760
- Better not.
- What's the matter? Not allowed!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.720
It's getting crook.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.600
Come on, wrestle.
If you beat me, you beat me.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.680
Peter, bloody get off me.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.480
Ah! Come on!

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.840
Come on, mate, it's only in fun.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.840
No, you're hurting me.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.600
Why don't you leave me alone?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.080
For God's sake, what do you want, Waite?

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.960
Cut the bull and get on with it.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.040
- You want to?
- Come on.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.720
Really?

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.520
- Come on.
- You're hurting.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.480
Come on. I'm ready.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.960
- Come on.
- Geez, Scraggs.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.760
Come on.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.840
It's all right. Come on, grab me.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.000
Come on. Grab me.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.880
Now squeeze.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.680
Oh, harder.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.800
Harder.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.520
Hey, what are you doing?

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.920
You, too. I've got to do you.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.800
Oh, squeeze!

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.680
Harder! How is it?

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.760
What now? What else?

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.040
Nothing. This is it.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.800
You're kidding!
Don't you want to be pulled?

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
What?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
Pulled.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.760
What's that?

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.120
You rub it up and down
'til stuff spurts everywhere.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.720
Spurts what?

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.800
White stuff.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.080
I don't know. No.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.760
If you do it, do it properly.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.920
- I've never...
- For God's sake!

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.600
It could be dangerous. I've never...

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.600
It's too warped. We'd better stop.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.680
Just what I expected. Can't handle it.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.560
You haven't got a single clue!

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.640
You're a miserable prick, Scraggs!

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.600
This letter to Miss Cochrane, Tom.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.080
Is she your cousin?

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.560
- No, Brother.
- Relative of any kind?

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.840
No, Brother.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.520
Then what's this: "Love", Tom?

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.920
And these kisses?

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.600
They always do that, Brother.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.880
It's like starting a letter off with "Dear".

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.840
Well... I think you'd better
rewrite the last page.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.720
And I think this had better
be the last letter.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.600
My, my, my. There's a gloomy face...

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.880
that matches the day.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.960
Are you miserable, Tom, hey?

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.360
Yes, Brother.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.840
We all have our troubles, Tom.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.800
Some a great deal worse than yours.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.680
You must stop worrying
about not being perfect.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.560
Nobody can be, so stop worrying about it.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.560
Otherwise, you'll have a
nervous breakdown.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.920
If the life here troubles you
too much, give it up.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.600
A lifetime's a long time
to be unhappy, Tom.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.000
Hang on to life, Tom.
It's supposed to be God's gift.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.880
Some gift, if it's just a misery.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.760
Enjoy life, Tom.
Make up your own mind about it.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.640
And don't be obsessed
about rules and regulations.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.000
Half the rules they make here
are unnecessary. And unnatural.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.680
You must do what's right for you.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.080
God Himself said,
"Be for Me or against Me,...

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.960
"but don't sit on the fence.
He that is tepid...

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.720
"I shall spew from My mouth."
Or words to that effect, anyway.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.920
Help me back to my room,
would you, lad?

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.800
It's a bit far for old meat.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:11.960
That's better.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.040
All right, time's up.
Hand your papers across to the center.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.520
Come on, hurry up.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.720
- Tough, hey?
- Have you heard from the Postulants?

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.960
What you make of question 7?

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.840
Hey, Westy, where's Turner?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.240
- He's missing.
- Missing?

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.520
Yeah. They reckon he's done the bunk.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.000
Turner?

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.680
Now I'll see if I can endure cold.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.560
I'm going to swim it... the lake!

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.040
The lake. I didn't take any notice.
I thought that...

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.720
That's good, Tom. Thanks for telling us.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.400
God help him.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.680
He was convinced he could
get across the lake.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.040
- He had some weird ideas that...
- Thank you, Tom! Thank you!

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.040
Yeah, further under, Phil, further under.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.600
Come here, you two, will you?

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.880
Come on, hurry up with those blankets!

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080
See if you can find me some long poles over there.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.560
OK, over the top, then back around.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:33.920
Come on, Jackson, keep moving!

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.520
You boys, over there, move right
around there, that's right. Keep looking!

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.480
Over here!

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.680
- Jesus save us!
- Bloody hell!

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.040
Secret society? New religious order?

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.640
That's not all.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.600
Homosexuality. Sadism. Masochism.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.280
Really sick.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.960
How did you find out?

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.440
Tom Allen told me. I can believe him.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.720
Gave him a pretty bad time, I'm afraid.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.800
Such a preposterous story!

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.200
My God, what have we done?

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.960
Rules. Too many bloody rules!

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.040
You see, Frank?

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:05.120
- It can't be true.
- It's true, Frank!

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.720
We questioned everyone,
didn't we, Arnold?

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.200
It's quite horrifying. The whole thing's
got to be changed, and soon!

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.960
It's just a few rotten apples, that's all.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.640
Get rid of them, it'll be all right!

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.040
- You'll see.
- It's much more of a problem
than that, I'm afraid.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.200
Too many bloody rules!

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.680
There's too much protection!

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.560
There's too much isolation,
they're too introverted.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.160
They know nothing of the world,
and they've got no chance of finding out.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.840
Everything out of proportion.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.600
- Mediaeval.
- It's worked up 'til now.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.800
Has it?

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.480
Well, look at us.
There's nothing wrong with us, is there?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:03.560
Celian handled pretty well.
He didn't dwell too much on the past.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.640
He talked a lot about future plans,
possible changes.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.720
They all pitched in with suggestions.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.200
Some good ones, too.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.480
Really helped clear the air.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:18.040
He spoke of the possibility of combining
the juniors as part of a
normal boarding school.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.200
Yeah, they really liked that idea.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.520
I think they realize it'll take a while.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.080
At least they'll know
something's being done.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.680
I must be off. I have to see how the
concert preparations are going.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.440
They seem to be doing all right now,
judging by the noise.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.920
Take care, my friend.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.720
What's this? For breaking the record
for the shortest broad jump:...

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.280
Compton.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.560
- Have to go on a diet I think, Jack.
- God bless you.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:12.640
The 1953 open sprint champion: Fitzpatrick.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.840
Won by the grace of a long nose, I'm told.
And Brother Victor's keen eyesight.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.120
Congratulations.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.680
<i>It's whispered to me that
you're wonderful, beautiful, heavenly...</i>

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:34.160
<i>and that you're mine, dear.</i>

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:57.640
<i>I'll take you home again, Kathleen...</i>

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:05.040
<i>- across the ocean wide...</i>
- It's his favorite.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.920
His best friend dies, so he sings.
How damned Irish!

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.200
He's happy. He knows, now, so...

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.880
He always knew!
He could see right through us!

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.960
He knew all our weaknesses.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.640
I hated his dotty, doubting senility.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.920
I hated him. But now I know I needed him.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.800
I need him now.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:13.880
<i>You will sit and watch the
moon rise over Claddagh</i>

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:25.760
- <i>And see the sun go down
on Galway Bay...</i>
- He loved life. - He loved life!

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.520
Well, he loved death.
He couldn't stand living.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.000
Well, he hasn't much choice now, Frank.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.560
- So let's remember what he did love:
Sebastian! - Sebastian!

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.040
I hate life. I hate it!

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.520
It's evil! Sick! Despicable!

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:49.440
Flesh! The Body!
Bunches of rules and discipline!

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.800
Control the body! Despise and
dominate it with your mind! Hogwash!

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.080
The body dominates the mind! Clogs it to the very corners!

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.160
The body doesn't lose...
it simply misses out.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.960
The body won't be denied.
The body WON'T be denied!

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.120
It keeps on fighting
with the mind. It loses.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.920
Wins the struggle
but loses everything else.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.080
What else do you think of, Vic?
Your mind is a cesspool of desire.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.360
And you, Jim? Even you, Arnie,
I bet gets you, too.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.840
Sebastian knew!
He's lucky... he's out of it.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.320
We're not... we're stuck with it.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.080
Give in. That's the only answer. Give in!

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.200
Or lose your mind.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.040
I've got a damned good body!

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.000
Nobody's looked at it for years,
let alone touched it.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.800
The body beautiful.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.600
The body innocent.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:14.680
It's done nothing. But the mind... it has!

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880
It has.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.960
It's sinned. Oh, how it's sinned!

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:31.120
Twisted, cowardly, perverted...
disgusting sins.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:42.920
I hate life. I hate it!

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.480
What's the matter? Sing, damn you!

01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.720
Go on, sing!

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.960
Francine's left the order, you know?

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.640
I thought he'd just gone to hospital.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.520
He did. He cracked up, apparently.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.280
Not surprised.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.880
He was really warped.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.640
Warped? He was round the bend.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.520
Like you, he had sexual problems.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.720
Oh, funny, Fitz.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.480
But he's had his first woman.If he marries
that lot, he'll probably drown somewhere.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.880
- What'll he do?
- Teach, I suppose.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.640
Pity the poor kids that get him.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.560
He'll probably be worse than he was here.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.600
He'd have trouble.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Eighteen years he's been a Brother.
Be a bit of a shock to him outside.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.280
What a life.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.360
He worries me. I don't know if I can do it.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.640
Could end up a nut like Francine,
or a pisspot like Victor.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.200
Victor's all right.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.800
No one could be perfect.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.960
There's no chance of me
being perfect, mate.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:23.560
It's the girls. Can't get them off my mind.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.440
Hannibal, looking out,
sees what he would take
to be the normal square Roman phalanx.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.720
Just like that, see?

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.600
This time, Scipio has made little holes
in the phalanx like that.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.080
So, when the elephants attack,
and they come across here...

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.640
they go straight down the center.
They take the least line
of resistance, see?

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.840
Would you favor us with your attention,
please, Allen?

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.720
Allen?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.280
Oh. Yes, Brother.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.160
Thank you.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.560
So, in come the elephants...

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.320
- Where's Fitz?
- He's gone.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.600
Celian called him out of class.
Told him to take his pin.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.800
- Gone?
- Liquidated. Just...

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.760
What'd he do?

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.240
Who knows? Probably had a cupboard
full of warped magazines.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.920
I can't give you his address, Tom.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.600
It wouldn't be right for you
to be in contact with him now.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.800
It could harm your vocation.

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.720
He'll have different ideas, now.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.840
Different ways of looking at things.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.120
It could put bad thoughts...
unnecessary thoughts... into your head.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.120
I know he was your
best friend, Tom, but...

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.800
well, it's best if you think of him as dead.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.680
You'll pray for him, Tom.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.160
That's the best thing you can do.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.640
Why?

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.600
Nothing's right. I fuck up everything.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.600
Hey, God... are You there?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.080
Where are You?

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.040
I pray, I ask, I try.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.640
Where are You?

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.800
Where's the help?

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.680
Come on... show me You're there.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.080
Answer me!

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.240
Answer just one prayer, even!

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.840
I want help, damn You!

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.520
Where you from?

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.000
Melbourne.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.560
Long way from home.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.400
I was visiting a school friend in Woody.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.920
How old are you?

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.320
Thirteen.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.200
Bit young for hitchhiking, aren't you?

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:17.360
- It's more fun than a train.
- Don't look like
you're having much fun to me!

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.760
Well, this is as far as I go
along my way, son.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.520
Thanks, Mister. Thanks a lot.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.600
Are you running away, Allen?

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.280
Get in. Come on, get in.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.480
I don't want to.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.840
Come on, we're going your way.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.520
Hurry up, come on or
we'll miss the curtain-raiser.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.800
Couldn't get a lift
with a nicer couple of fellows, Tom.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.720
You all right?

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.080
Yes, thanks, Brother.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.360
I knew you'd do it.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.840
I said you wouldn't last, didn't I, Jim?

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.600
Hey, what do you think of our civvies?
Pretty classy, hey?

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.200
Think we look human?

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.160
Yes, Brother.

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:08.240
Hey, why don't we take him with us?

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.520
What, the semi? Yeah!

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.920
Want to see the semi-final, Tom?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.200
- Oh, yeah!
- Righto, you're on!

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.680
Don't worry. We'll ring your folks
and run you home afterwards, hey?

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:24.760
How about that? It'll keep Jim
off the streets and out of
temptation's path, so they say!

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.720
Keep you out of the pub!
That's the groan!

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.800
Oh, no worries!

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.880
Tom's dad's good for a couple.
He likes a drink, doesn't he, Tom?

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080
I reckon.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.560
- Like Tom at full forward?
- We'll give it the gun!

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.600
Yeah, righto, what are we
wasting our freedom for?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.920
We haven't got as much time
out here as he's going to have!

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.000
Hang onto your hat, Tom!

01:32:45.305 --> 01:32:51.837
