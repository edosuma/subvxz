WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:08.410
Carry on, my wayward son

00:27.227 --> 00:29.707
I will save my brother or die trying.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.302
- It's the Mark of Cain.
- It's just a curse. It can be removed.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.403
- You're their bitch.
- Get out.

00:34.568 --> 00:39.847
The Book of the Damned is a spellbook for
creating or undoing any damnation there is.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.111
I think. this is in code.

00:41.275 --> 00:46.122
Bring me Nadya's Codex
and I'll break this text right open.

00:52.686 --> 00:57.066
Dean is not getting any better. If we don't get
the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.038
My grace, it's been restored.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.739
Find me a cure for my brother,
and I'll kill Crowley.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.448
Thank you, Sam,
for reminding me who I really am.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.586
There must be something
I don't know about her.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.914
Something I could hold over her
as a bargaining chip.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.557
She's cracked the code.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.422
Charlie?

01:26.887 --> 01:31.131
- I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.292
Anything?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.863
Twelve voicemails.

02:01.021 --> 02:05.163
Lo-jack on the Impala
has clearly been disabled...

02:05.325 --> 02:07.498
...so a big heaping scoop of nothing.

02:07.661 --> 02:11.768
We need Rowena
to hold up her end of the bargain, now.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.546
- What?
- Nothing. it's...

02:17.704 --> 02:21.618
It's just, if she removes the Mark
using the Book of the Damned...

02:21.775 --> 02:23.311
...what of the consequences?

02:23.477 --> 02:24.820
Which are what?

02:25.612 --> 02:27.057
- Dean said...
- Dean guessed.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.190
Cass, what are we supposed to do, huh?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.799
Just sit on our asses? Do nothing?

02:37.958 --> 02:40.871
- No. We find Dean.
- And then what?

02:41.561 --> 02:43.905
The only thing that stopped Cain was death.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.010
Do you wanna kill Dean? Because I don't.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.306
And the only way I know how
to save my brother is to cure the Mark.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.506
And, yes, I know there
will be consequences.

02:51.672 --> 02:55.643
But not you, not Dean, not anybody,
can tell me what those consequences are.

02:55.809 --> 02:59.222
So I'm not gonna let my brother
destroy himself on a guess.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.425
We save Dean.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.234
I'm good.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.867
I'm good.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.926
Rose McKinley.
Raised up about three miles from here.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.825
Nice parents. God-fearing folk.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.262
Who let her leave the house
looking like a whore.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.966
Whoa.

04:19.125 --> 04:22.573
- Why don't you tell me what you really think?
- I'm sorry, sheriff. My bad.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.937
Well, let me tell you
how we work out here, son.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.172
That right there could be the Whore of
Babylon, wouldn't make no difference at all...

04:30.337 --> 04:32.783
...because all I see is
somebody's little girl.

04:33.173 --> 04:37.644
And I feel like a real jerk suggesting
otherwise, sheriff. My apologies.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.450
Good luck cracking the case
with your eyes shut.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.996
You worked some pretty dark stuff
in your day, haven't you, agent?

04:47.154 --> 04:49.156
Must have left quite a mark.

04:49.322 --> 04:50.926
Oh, you have no idea.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.632
- Your partner's a piece of work, agent.
- Yeah, ain't he though?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.639
Dean-o.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.209
Welcome to the party.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.110
The hell you doing here, Rudy?

05:01.268 --> 05:04.181
Oh, you know,
just a thing I got for dead girls. Heh.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.451
Working a gang of fang, you know?
Just like you.

05:09.609 --> 05:12.886
Not today you're not. I'm gonna need
you to take a walk on this one.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.451
Uh, okay, except, uh...

05:15.615 --> 05:19.358
- Except I called you, so if
anybody's walking... - You called me?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.129
No, no. You begged me.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.498
Just like Tuscaloosa. Just like Old Lyme.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.502
We know you're playing dress-up here.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.074
Just a matter of time before you get
yourself killed. So take that walk...

05:31.231 --> 05:33.541
- ...and let the real hunters do the work.
- Agents.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.475
New deal.

05:35.635 --> 05:38.206
Rose wasn't alone when she disappeared.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.874
A friend name Crystal Thorrson
was with her.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.682
And Crystal is still AWOL.
I'm heading over to interview the parents.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.251
How about we agree
you boys sit this one out?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.326
You know something?

05:52.485 --> 05:55.329
Life's too short, partner.

05:55.488 --> 05:59.061
You know, I don't know what crawled up
your ass today. Frankly, I don'! care.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.906
Regards to your brother.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.357
Hello, boys. Just in time for tea.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.359
Unless something on your mind?

06:25.518 --> 06:27.691
Five things, actually.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.296
Hollow tips filled with witch-killing brew.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.099
How exciting for you.

06:34.261 --> 06:37.401
Your NRA will be beside themselves
with pride.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.569
No more games, Rowena. Do the spell now.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.376
Or what, exactly?

06:45.538 --> 06:49.486
Come on, Samuel. You and I both
know that's nothing but a bluff.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.318
Charlie may have cracked the Codex,
but who's going to read it if I'm gone?

06:53.480 --> 06:56.825
Not to mention handling the ingredients,
getting the measurements right.

06:56.983 --> 07:00.430
Unless of course, either of you
have spent years of your life...

07:00.587 --> 07:04.262
...studying with the greats, mastering
the intricacies of high witchcraft.

07:04.424 --> 07:08.463
But forgive me, maybe you have.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.501
I know you're upset. We all are.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.172
Poor Dean.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.979
Let's just have a nice wee cup of tea...

07:22.142 --> 07:23.678
...and negotiate.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.292
- What do you want?
- Oh, well...

07:30.917 --> 07:32.487
We know what I wanted.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.996
Soiled the sheets on that one, didn't we?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.930
Let's talk about what I'll take.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.196
My freedom, guaranteed...

07:40.360 --> 07:41.703
...and the Codex.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.141
- Sam, you can't be...
- Do you know which spell?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.845
I do.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.349
Sam.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.952
This is a mistake.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.790
Rose and Crystal were friends since...

08:02.349 --> 08:04.056
...forever, it seems.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.693
You think that Crystal could
still be in danger?

08:08.855 --> 08:11.631
We do, Mrs. McKinley.
And the fastest way to find Crystal...

08:11.791 --> 08:13.634
...is to find out who did this to Rose.

08:13.793 --> 08:16.501
Did you notice any change
in her behavior recently?

08:16.663 --> 08:20.634
Uh, new friends? Uh, a new boyfriend?
Maybe a crush?

08:21.668 --> 08:24.012
Rose was...

08:24.170 --> 08:26.013
...a shy girl.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.920
But you think she might know
who did this to her?

08:32.078 --> 08:34.251
In Rose's case,
she not only knew the person...

08:34.414 --> 08:36.587
...she was trying
to have intercourse with them.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.927
So I'm just trying to figure out
whether it was a boyfriend...

08:40.086 --> 08:42.760
...or whether it was just some
random roll in the hay.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.730
No...

08:46.226 --> 08:48.570
...there were no relations
that we're aware of.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.401
No relations at all.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.737
- What the hell is this, agent?
- I'm just doing my job, Mr. McKinley.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.939
- By suggesting my daughter was a slut?
- I'll admit, that thought crossed my mind.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.778
Then I came here and smelled the deceit,
the beatings and the shame...

09:02.942 --> 09:05.616
...that pervade this home,
and I don't blame Rose anymore.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.521
- Shut your face.
- No wonder she put on that skank outfit...

09:08.681 --> 09:10.683
...and went out looking for validation.

09:10.850 --> 09:14.127
Right into the arms of the monster
that killed her. Joe, who did this?

09:15.922 --> 09:17.560
- Joe!
- Who did this?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.567
- Stop!
- Joe.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.262
Who did this?

09:29.869 --> 09:32.076
I don't know.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.115
I don't know.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.672
- Whoa.
- What?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.833
Crystal, she's still...?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.138
Why?

10:04.070 --> 10:06.641
There were these guys
living out by Cross Creek.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.485
Said they were rehabbing a cabin out there.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.623
Mostly I think they just wanted a place
to drink and meet girls.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.918
And Crystal and your sister
knew these guys?

10:16.783 --> 10:19.764
You couldn't tell the cops that
when your sister turned up dead'?

10:19.919 --> 10:22.593
I was the one who brought them there
in the first place.

10:33.833 --> 10:39.112
"Something made by God,
but forbidden to man."

10:39.272 --> 10:40.979
Forbidden?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.788
The forbidden fruit?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.181
No.

10:50.517 --> 10:54.829
The actual apple is the first ingredient?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.828
Okay, what's next?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.963
"Something made by man,
but forbidden by God."

11:03.129 --> 11:07.134
Okay, well, God forbade false idols, right?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.836
The Golden Calf.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.678
Wasn't that destroyed?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.250
Great. Ahem.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.855
What's the third ingredient?

11:22.982 --> 11:24.586
Oh.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.253
What?

11:27.153 --> 11:29.531
The third ingredient, it's impossible.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.199
What is it?

11:32.258 --> 11:34.534
Loosely translated?

11:34.694 --> 11:35.832
My heart.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.937
That's not impossible at all.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.236
Not my literal heart, feathers.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.006
Something I love.
The spell calls for me to kill it.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.443
- A sacrifice.
- Precisely.

11:44.604 --> 11:48.177
The book will grant freedom from the curse,
but it wants something in return.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.912
- Then give it.
- Bring me something I love, I'll kill it.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.557
I want my freedom too much
to make a fuss over that.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.556
The problem is, I don't love anything.

11:55.715 --> 12:00.061
- What about Crowley?
- Happy to kill him. Let's not call it love.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.622
I don't believe you.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.427
Everyone loves something.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.102
Oskar.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.635
Oskar.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.075
Polish boy.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.782
Oskar.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.716
I'm sorry. Oskar?

12:23.876 --> 12:25.787
You saw Oskar?

12:25.945 --> 12:28.824
- Who is he?
- Who was he? A peasant boy.

12:28.982 --> 12:32.259
His family helped me through
some difficulties 300 years ago.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.434
Rudy, what's up?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.627
I wish I could say it was good news, Sam.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.899
I just bumped into Dean working
a fangbanger case in Superior.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.306
- Dean's in Nebraska? Working a case?
- Yeah.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.313
My case.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.513
And he's not playing well with others.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.778
Yeah, Dean's not exactly...

12:55.942 --> 12:57.853
...in the best place right now.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.117
You know what? Do me a favor.
Just text me the details, would you?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.023
- All right. Whatever you need.
- Okay. Thanks.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.632
- What's going on?
- Cass, take this.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.827
It's Dean's hair. You
need it for the spell.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.495
Cass, I need you to do this for me.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.643
Make the spell happen, whatever it takes.
Please.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.634
Dean-o, this is Reggie.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.739
We're just gonna talk. All right?

13:48.895 --> 13:51.068
And come to an understanding.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.336
Back your ass out of the room, mister.
And leave the blade.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.878
Yeah...

13:57.036 --> 13:58.310
...no.

13:58.471 --> 14:02.214
- Rudy, walk away.
- No... No, Dean. Dean-o, just do what he says.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.855
He's not gonna kill you.
You're his insurance, all right?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.082
Now, man the hell up and walk away.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.988
Oh, I will kill him, friend.
You keep yapping, I will.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.492
- Do it.
- Dean.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.925
- Back up.
- Do it.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.930
- Do not... Don't test me.
- Dean, stop.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.500
You don't have the guts.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.766
Aah!

14:31.270 --> 14:33.216
What did you do?

14:34.774 --> 14:36.185
You're Crystal, right?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.681
Yeah, well...

14:40.413 --> 14:41.619
...I just rescued you.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.852
He... You could have talked.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.620
You just.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.355
You're welcome.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.784
He just let him die.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.188
He just let him die.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.324
Just let him die.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.334
Agent.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.701
Maybe you can tell me
what in the hell is going on here.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.837
The way the girl outside tells it,
one of your boys came in hot...

16:11.003 --> 16:12.710
...got his partner killed...

16:12.872 --> 16:16.217
...and then went some kind of samurai
on that son of a bitch over there.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.116
I knew that boy...

16:36.629 --> 16:39.041
Who summons anymore?

16:39.232 --> 16:40.302
Couldn't you call?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.343
You're not in my contacts list.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.479
- What?
- I need your assistance...

16:47.640 --> 16:49.711
...to help cure Dean of the Mark.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.720
What's the expression?
I gave at the office.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.825
Maybe I'd feel different if Sam Winchester
hadn't just tried to bloody kill me!

16:57.984 --> 17:02.364
I'm afraid no is not an acceptable answer.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.523
Or what?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.896
- Or?
- That's right.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.696
Burn those eyes blue.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.865
Spread those broken wings and destroy me.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.035
Or do it my way.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.248
Right.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.712
Now, beg.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.914
- What?
- Blast me, or beg.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.420
- Crowley...
- King.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.217
King.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.394
If you... If you would...
If you would be so kind...

17:38.024 --> 17:39.935
...the three ingredients on this list.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.396
"Forbidden fruit."

17:44.397 --> 17:47.901
Well, for starters, it's a
quince, you dummy. Not an apple.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.079
No problem. "Golden Calf."

17:51.237 --> 17:53.740
Or what's left of it. Check.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.947
Something Rowena loves?

17:56.108 --> 18:00.579
- I would've thought it'd have been you, but...
- Spare me. I've lived it.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.932
- Well...?
- I'm in.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.625
Dean, it's me.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.003
Don't tell me that's queso.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.706
Yeah. Yes.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.738
Queso and taquitos.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.883
Tamales.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.849
Homemade by yours truly.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.882
All with the bad fat.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.757
Consider it an offering.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.717
For?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.897
I want you to kill me.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.239
What I find truly fascinating, Dean...

20:31.630 --> 20:33.871
Mm. That's good.

20:34.033 --> 20:38.379
...Is that you and I both know that
I've been burned by you Winchesters before.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.312
Yet, you still call.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.079
Yeah, I know. But not this time, okay?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.086
No games, no second thoughts.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.557
I know you know what this is.

20:51.717 --> 20:54.596
I know you know what it can do.
I've tried to fight it.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.325
I've tried to beat it on my own...

20:57.990 --> 20:59.162
...and I can't.

21:00.159 --> 21:03.766
I got no moves left. Except you.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.839
Well, I never thought I'd see the day.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.673
My goodness.

21:09.835 --> 21:13.248
Dean Winchester has tipped over his king.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.956
But I won't kill you, Dean.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.784
You're Death.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.918
And that Mark on your
arm is the first curse.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.858
Nothing can kill you.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.692
Okay, forget killing me.
Can you get rid of it?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.765
I could.

21:31.957 --> 21:32.958
But...?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.973
God created the Earth out of nothing.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.044
Or so your Sunday School teacher
would have you believe.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.205
Oh, so Genesis is a lie? Huh? Shocker.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.612
Before there was light,
before there was God and the archangels...

21:50.776 --> 21:53.154
...there wasn't nothing.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.622
There was the Darkness.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.886
A horribly destructive, amoral force...

21:58.050 --> 22:02.795
...that was beaten back by God and
his archangels in a terrible war.

22:02.955 --> 22:06.801
God locked the Darkness away
where it could do no harm.

22:06.959 --> 22:12.807
And he created a Mark
that would serve as both lock and key.

22:13.299 --> 22:17.338
Which he entrusted
to his most valued lieutenant, Lucifer.

22:17.503 --> 22:21.315
But the Mark began to
assert its own will...

22:21.473 --> 22:25.512
...revealed itself as a curse
and began to corrupt.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.318
Lucifer became jealous of man.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.359
God banished Lucifer to hell.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.360
Lucifer passed the Mark to Cain...

22:34.520 --> 22:37.433
...who passed the Mark to you.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.436
The proverbial finger in the dike.

22:43.762 --> 22:47.710
Well, that is just
fan-frigging-tastic, isn't it?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.541
So I could remove the Mark...

22:50.703 --> 22:54.116
...but only if you will
share it with another...

22:54.273 --> 22:58.050
...to ensure that the
lock remains unbroken...

22:58.210 --> 23:01.885
...and the Darkness remains bound.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.886
I'm not doing that.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.226
Not to anyone.

23:09.688 --> 23:15.366
What if I told you I could relocate you
somewhere far away, not even on this earth...

23:15.527 --> 23:20.738
...where you would still be alive but no
longer a danger to yourself or to others?

23:29.575 --> 23:32.215
- Dean.
- I gave it a shot, Sammy.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.824
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing...

23:34.980 --> 23:37.119
...whatever you've done, please...

23:38.083 --> 23:40.654
Hell, I even worked a case.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.924
I gave everything I had
to beat this thing down.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.002
I saw. I saw Rudy.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.900
Well, then you saw what I did.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.597
No, that wasn't you.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.902
Sure as hell felt like me.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.242
Brother, I'm done.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.613
No. No, you're not. Dean...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.412
Grab a pen. it's time to say goodbye.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.580
I'll get your refill, Jimmy.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.667
Fancy a story?

24:16.922 --> 24:19.528
You. What did you do?

24:26.799 --> 24:30.645
A long, long time ago,
there once lived an evil bitch...

24:30.803 --> 24:32.612
Sorry. "Witch."

24:32.771 --> 24:36.719
...who was forced to flee her home
and her only son because she was, well...

24:36.875 --> 24:38.445
...horrible.

24:38.610 --> 24:43.059
Starving and homeless, she threw herself
upon the mercy of a peasant Polish family...

24:43.215 --> 24:47.322
...who took her in, fed her,
and nursed her back to full strength.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.727
This was a kindness she had never known.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.233
She was particularly taken
by their 8-year-old son...

24:53.692 --> 24:55.797
...who, apparently...

24:55.961 --> 24:58.498
...she grew to love. Hm.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.207
How do you know all this?

25:02.668 --> 25:04.705
A hamster told me.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.083
Tragically...

25:09.508 --> 25:12.853
...the boy was terminally
ill, and soon to die.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.685
But before the witch departed...

25:14.847 --> 25:19.262
...she gave the boy and his family
the only thanks that made sense.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.694
She cured the boy with one spell.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.698
And cast another that would take root
once he was full-grown.

25:24.857 --> 25:30.933
That lying, manipulative, whore mother of
mine gave you immortality, didn't she, Oskar?

25:50.749 --> 25:53.753
- Hey.
- Sam.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.802
- What is this?
- We need to talk.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.632
Whatever you are thinking of doing, don't.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.305
There is another way.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.276
You don't need to go with him.
You don't need to die.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.403
Funny you say that.

26:11.703 --> 26:16.049
Truth is, when I left,
I thought the only way out was my death.

26:17.476 --> 26:18.921
I was wrong, Sam.

26:20.145 --> 26:22.216
It's yours.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.895
What? He's gonna...?

26:33.058 --> 26:36.232
- He's gonna send you into outer space?
- He didn't say "outer space."

26:36.395 --> 26:38.739
- This is madness, Dean.
- Far from it, I'm afraid.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.808
- No one's asking you.
- Hear him out.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.439
Our conundrum is simple, Sam.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.311
Your brother cannot be killed,
and the Mark cannot be destroyed.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.283
Not without inciting a far greater evil...

26:50.442 --> 26:53.423
...than any of us have ever known.
- What evil?

26:53.579 --> 26:55.422
- The Darkness.
- What the hell is that?

26:55.581 --> 26:58.118
What's it sound like?
Does it sound like a good thing?

26:59.785 --> 27:03.289
Even if I remove Dean
from the playing field...

27:03.455 --> 27:05.162
...we're still left with you.

27:05.357 --> 27:11.603
Loyal, dogged Sam, who, I suspect, will
never rest until he sets his brother free.

27:11.763 --> 27:16.269
Will never rest
until his brother is free of the Mark...

27:16.435 --> 27:22.681
...which simply cannot happen
lest the Darkness be set free.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.881
Then there was that time you stood me up.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.130
You traded my life.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.858
I'm willing to live with
this thing forever...

27:38.023 --> 27:42.631
...as long as I know that I and it
will never hurt another living thing.

27:43.695 --> 27:44.696
This isn't you.

27:46.798 --> 27:49.836
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, it makes perfect sense.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.539
If you stop thinking about yourself
for one damn minute.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.544
It's for the greater good.

27:55.707 --> 28:00.349
Once you consider that,
this makes all the sense in the world.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.860
Why the long faces?

28:09.054 --> 28:11.159
Oh, let me guess.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.532
Mother showed you
her mustn't-touch-it again.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.070
You have the ingredients?

28:21.433 --> 28:25.347
The quince cost me a major IOU
with a Palestinian warlock.

28:25.504 --> 28:28.713
The gold from the calf?
Well, let's just say...

28:28.874 --> 28:33.721
...I'll be hanged under certain sexual deviancy
laws if I ever show my face in Jordan again.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.257
- And the third?
- Ah, yes.

28:39.751 --> 28:45.258
All my long life I wondered what I'd done to
deserve a mother who refused to show love.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.399
I pained over it.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.772
I built my bloody kingdom on top of it.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.241
And then one day...

28:57.402 --> 28:58.779
...epiphany struck.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.981
My mother was incapable of loving anything.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.379
For the first time in hundreds of years...

29:07.546 --> 29:08.786
...I felt free.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.483
And then you showed up in my dungeon.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.919
We communed...

29:14.086 --> 29:18.091
...and I began to realize
you weren't incapable of love.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.563
You were incapable of loving me.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.936
Goodness, Fergus.
Save it for the stage, why don't you?

29:25.097 --> 29:29.136
I mean, fabulous speech, but you put
yourself on far too high a pedestal.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.643
The fact remains, I do not...

29:33.105 --> 29:36.985
...will not and have not
loved anything, ever.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.307
You were saying?

30:00.465 --> 30:03.639
Remember when we were in that church,
making Crowley human?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.975
About to close the Gates of Hell.

30:06.138 --> 30:09.347
You sure as hell were ready
to die for the greater good then.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.985
Yeah, and, Dean, you pulled me back.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.851
And I was wrong.

30:14.546 --> 30:15.616
You were right, Sam.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.155
You knew that this world would be better
without us in it.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.128
No, no, no. Wait a second.
You're twisting my words here.

30:22.287 --> 30:25.200
Why? Because we... We
track evil and kill it?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.064
The family business, is that it?

30:28.126 --> 30:30.197
Look at the tape, Sam.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.535
Evil tracks us.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.008
And it nukes everything in our vicinity.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.703
Our family, our friends.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.712
It's time we put a proper name
to what we really are...

30:39.871 --> 30:41.851
...and we deal with it.

30:42.841 --> 30:47.153
Wait a second. We are not evil.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.190
Listen.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.487
We're far from perfect...

30:51.650 --> 30:52.720
...but we are good.

30:54.386 --> 30:58.994
That thing on your arm
is evil, but not you.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.363
Not me.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.505
I let Rudy die.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.043
How was that not evil?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.406
I know what I am, Sam.

31:11.203 --> 31:15.879
But who were you when you-J?
When you drove that man to sell his soul?

31:17.409 --> 31:22.222
Or when you bullied Charlie
into getting herself killed?

31:22.381 --> 31:23.917
And to what end?

31:24.082 --> 31:26.028
A good end?

31:26.184 --> 31:27.561
A just end?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.265
To remove the Mark
no matter what the consequences...

31:31.423 --> 31:32.766
...Sam, how is that not evil?

31:33.925 --> 31:35.563
I have this thing on my arm...

31:35.727 --> 31:39.766
...and you're willing to let the Darkness
into the world.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.104
You were also willing to summon Death...

31:42.267 --> 31:46.113
...to make sure you could never
do any more harm.

31:47.439 --> 31:52.752
You summoned me because you knew
I would do anything to protect you.

31:53.779 --> 31:56.259
That's not evil, Dean.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.760
That's not an evil man.
That is a good man...

31:59.918 --> 32:05.266
...crying to be heard.
Searching for some other way.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.067
No, there is no other way, Sam.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.667
I'm sorry.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.247
Good.

32:23.308 --> 32:24.412
Fight.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.583
This is ridiculous.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.927
Do you love this man, Rowena? Is it true?

32:32.083 --> 32:33.756
Of course it's true.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.325
Say hello, Oskar.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.831
Rowena.

32:41.159 --> 32:44.629
Even for you, Fergus, this is a new low.

32:46.431 --> 32:49.139
A cruel, shameful, disgusting low.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.680
It's only cruel
if you actually go through with it.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.682
Though...

32:56.475 --> 32:58.716
...who's the cruel one then?

33:28.039 --> 33:29.211
Okay.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.014
That's enough.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.888
You will never...

33:43.321 --> 33:44.732
...ever...

33:45.056 --> 33:46.535
...hear me say...

33:46.691 --> 33:48.693
...that you...

33:49.160 --> 33:51.071
...the real you...

33:51.997 --> 33:53.567
...is anything but good.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.214
But you're right.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.752
Before you hurt...

34:10.549 --> 34:11.891
...anyone else...

34:13.518 --> 34:16.431
...you have to be stopped, at any cost.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.594
I understand.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.271
Do it. Ahem.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.583
Please.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.255
Do me the honor.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.903
Close your eyes.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.120
Sammy, close your eyes.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.153
Wait.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.628
Take these.

35:24.155 --> 35:27.295
And one day, when you find your way back...

35:28.960 --> 35:31.372
...let these be your guide.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.773
They can help you remember...

35:34.933 --> 35:36.935
...what it was to be good.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.675
What it was to love.

35:59.357 --> 36:03.499
It's for family you must proceed, Dean.

36:03.662 --> 36:09.635
To be what you are, to become what you've
become is a stain on their memory.

36:10.702 --> 36:11.737
Do it.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.376
Or I will.

36:31.222 --> 36:33.168
Forgive me.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.798
You've grown so big.

37:10.028 --> 37:13.976
Not too big to give
your old Auntie Rowena a hug, I hope?

37:14.132 --> 37:16.442
I hope I haven't hurt you.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.643
Don't think about that one moment.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.250
Everything's fine, Oskar.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.616
Everything's fine.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.583
Nobody's hurting anybody.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.791
Goodbye, my sweet wee boy.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.144
You okay?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.156
I'll live.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.453
You?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.460
Fantastic.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.198
I think I just killed Death.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.852
That sound right to you?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.047
What is this?

39:11.649 --> 39:13.060
This is impossible.

39:13.218 --> 39:14.595
You're not powerful enough.

39:14.752 --> 39:18.757
To what? Control the likes of a bored king
and a wayward angel?

39:23.895 --> 39:27.069
I'm afraid, Fergus, that
in all your long life...

39:27.232 --> 39:30.577
...you've never seen what a real
witch can do with real magic.

39:31.402 --> 39:36.374
I'm terrifically pleased
it's the last thing you'll ever see.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.556
Castiel...

39:43.715 --> 39:45.217
...don't.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.586
Do not.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.389
Don't. Please!

39:54.592 --> 39:58.904
This is good. Dean. This is good.
The Mark is off your arm.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.440
Nothing crazy happened.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.600
You get your baby back.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.113
Yeah. I'm sure everything's perfectly fine.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.551
What the...?

40:28.092 --> 40:30.470
What did Death call this?

40:31.162 --> 40:32.163
The Darkness.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.002
- Get in the car. Let's go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.855
Dean.

41:47.071 --> 41:48.141
Dean!
