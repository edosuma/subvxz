PLEASE LEAVE, ALL RIGHT?

11:30.472 --> 11:33.475
I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE.THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT.
NO ONE GETS IT.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.085
SO THERE'S NO LEMONS HERE?

11:35.085 --> 11:37.087
NO, I DON'T THINK SO!

11:37.087 --> 11:40.090
I REALLY FELT LIKE...
MM, NEVER MIND.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.658
YOUR SISTER
NEEDS YOU HERE NOW.

11:42.658 --> 11:46.357
AS COMFORTING AS IT MIGHT BE
TO CRAWL UNDER THE BLANKET

11:46.357 --> 11:50.535
OF NARCOTICS THAT YOUR HUSBAND
HAS SO GENEROUSLY PROCURED

11:50.535 --> 11:53.147
FOR YOU,
IT'S BETTER THAT YOU DON'T.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.540
[sniffles] NOTHING I DO
IS GOING TO HELP HER.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.021
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.631
WHAT'S THE POINT?

11:59.631 --> 12:03.374
WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH
IS IRRELEVANT.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.421
BUT IF YOU ARE ABSENT
IN THIS MOMENT,

12:06.421 --> 12:08.423
YOU WILL REGRET IT
FOR THE REST

12:08.423 --> 12:11.208
OF WHAT WILL BE
A MISERABLE LIFE.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.257
THAT'S ALL.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.824
SEE YOU.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.748
[Lisbon] WHAT WERE YOU
DOING BACK THERE?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.446
OH, JUST GETTING A SNACK,
A LITTLE LIGHT REFRESHMENT.

12:31.446 --> 12:35.276
WHY DON'T I BELIEVE YOU?WHAT? W-WHAT IS THIS?

12:35.276 --> 12:38.888
THIS IS PROOF OF MY VERACITY.IT'S TIME TO GO.

12:38.888 --> 12:42.457
I'M GONNA STAY.I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
BOSCO'S GOT THE RED JOHN FILE.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.286
YOU THINK IF YOU HANG AROUND
LONG ENOUGH,

12:45.286 --> 12:48.376
YOU'LL WEASEL YOUR WAY INTO IT."WEASEL" IS A LITTLE STRONG.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.465
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
BOSCO WILL NEVER GO FOR IT.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.336
NEVER.

12:52.336 --> 12:55.600
WHAT?
I'LL NEVER GO FOR WHAT?I LIKE THE WAY YOU WORK.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.386
I WANT TO WORK ON YOUR TEAM
ON THE, UH, KIDNAPPING DETAIL.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.562
OH, YOU DO, HUH?

13:00.562 --> 13:02.390
A LIVE KIDNAPPING VICTIM
IS SO MUCH MORE MY SPEED

13:02.390 --> 13:05.393
THAN A SHRIVELED CORPSE.LIKE I CARE ABOUT YOUR SPEED.

13:05.393 --> 13:08.788
LISBON, YOU CLAIM TO HAVE
CONTROL OVER THIS WHACK-JOB.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.313
WHY DON'T YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND WALK HIM AWAY?DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.577
YEAH, THAT'S VERY RUDE.QUIET. MINELLI GAVE US
SPECIFIC ORDERS.

13:15.577 --> 13:19.363
I DON'T GIVE A FLYING--HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY!
YOU THIS AGENT'S BOSS?

13:19.363 --> 13:22.584
WHY?I WANT HIM REMOVED
FROM THIS CASE NOW.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.716
NOW,ALL RIGHT?

13:24.716 --> 13:27.676
HE'S--HE'S DISRESPECTFUL
AND, UH, RUDE

13:27.676 --> 13:30.374
AND--AND UNPROFESSIONAL.OH, HE'S JUST ANGRY
'CAUSE I CALLED HIM

13:30.374 --> 13:34.726
ON HIS LITTLE DRUG DEAL THING.OKAY, YOU'RE NUTS.
I HAVE NO DRUGS.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.163
LIAR.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.600
I DEMAND YOU TAKE
THIS MAN OFF THE CASE,

13:38.600 --> 13:41.951
OR THERE WILL BE
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.WELL, SIR,
THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.997
OH, YEAH? YOU THINK?

13:43.997 --> 13:46.869
ONE PHONE CALL, I CAN HAVE YOU
DIRECTING TRAFFIC.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.349
IS THAT RIGHT?

13:48.349 --> 13:50.394
YEAH, IT IS.

13:50.394 --> 13:53.397
WELL, MAKE YOUR CALL, BECAUSE
THIS MAN'S STAYING ON THE CASE

13:53.397 --> 13:56.357
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.REALLY?

13:56.357 --> 13:59.534
YEAH.YOU SEE--SEE THIS? YOU SEE
WHAT HE'S DONE TO MY WIFE?

13:59.534 --> 14:02.102
I MEAN,
THIS GUY'S OUT OF CONTROL.SHUT UP, DUNCAN.

14:02.102 --> 14:05.932
BABY,
I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN--SHUT UP.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.759
MR. JANE, IS IT?

14:07.759 --> 14:09.283
YEAH.

14:09.283 --> 14:14.679
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER
WAS RIGHT. THANK YOU...

14:14.679 --> 14:16.507
I GUESS. [chuckles]

14:16.507 --> 14:19.380
[sniffles]
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.910
OKAY, THEN. IT'S SETTLED.
HAVE FUN. BOYS.

14:34.525 --> 14:37.137
WAIT.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.145
FROM THE COLIN HAYMER CASE.

14:45.145 --> 14:48.104
SO YOU WANT NAMES THAT BEGIN
WITH "A" THROUGH "L"

14:48.104 --> 14:49.671
OR "M" THROUGH "Z"?"A" THROUGH "L."

14:49.671 --> 14:51.455
YOU GOT IT.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.631
CHANGED MY MIND.
I WANT "M" THROUGH "Z."

14:53.631 --> 14:55.285
TOO LATE. YOU ALREADY CHOSE.

14:55.285 --> 14:58.506
OH, COME ON.
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS? STEP UP.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.900
HEY, BERT, CAN I GET
ON THIS ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.554
I HAVEN'T HAD A REALLY GOOD
GAME SINCE I WAS, OH, 10.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.383
IT'S RIGSBY.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.777
I KNOW.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.954
HEY, WHAT'S WITH HICKS
CALLING ME BERT?

15:11.954 --> 15:14.609
UM, I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.741
IT'S BERT, LIKE THE MUPPET.

15:16.741 --> 15:20.136
IT'S JUST A STUPID NICKNAME.
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.138
BOSCO'S TEAM CALLS US
BERT AND ERNIE.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.793
YOU KNEW THAT,
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?IT WOULD BOTHER YOU.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.969
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?NO.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.885
WHY NOT?ERNIE'S THE CLEVER,
HANDSOME ONE.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.800
WHERE'S JANE?WITH BOSCO.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.194
DON'T ASK ME WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

15:34.194 --> 15:37.893
AND I DON'T CARE.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?I'VE BEEN CHECKING OUT
THE HOUSE

15:37.893 --> 15:40.635
WHERE WE FOUND
COLIN HAYMER'S BODY.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.550
IT'S BEEN ABANDONED
SEVEN YEARS.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.552
THERE WERE SOME COMPLAINTS
ABOUT SQUATTERS

15:44.552 --> 15:46.554
FIVE, SIX YEARS AGO.
NOTHING ELSE.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.470
AGENT LISBON,
THERE'S A LOUIS EARLEN

15:49.470 --> 15:52.473
TO SEE YOU IN YOUR OFFICE.KEEP DIGGING.

15:52.473 --> 15:53.648
RIGHT.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.606
LIEUTENANT EARLEN.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.348
THANKS FOR COMING.LOUIS, PLEASE. I'M RETIRED.

15:58.348 --> 16:01.177
SO YOU FOUND
POOR COLIN HAYMER?

16:01.177 --> 16:02.744
WE DID.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.920
YOU WERE THE S.F.P.D. OFFICER

16:04.920 --> 16:06.487
IN CHARGE OF THE KIDNAPPING
INVESTIGATION, RIGHT?

16:06.487 --> 16:10.230
I WAS. SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH THE HAYMER FAMILY.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.623
HAVE THEY BEEN NOTIFIED?THEY HAVE.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.625
OH. HOPE IT'S SOME KIND
OF CONSOLATION.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.845
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR THAT BOY.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.890
WE HAVE ANOTHER KIDNAPPING.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.284
WE THINK THE SAME PEOPLE
MIGHT BE BEHIND IT.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.677
HOW CAN I HELP?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.679
ANYBODY YOU THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT?

16:24.679 --> 16:27.464
[chuckles] TALL ORDER.
WE LOOKED AT A LOT OF PEOPLE.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.293
WELL, WE WERE WONDERING
IF MAYBE IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.774
THE RANSOM DEMAND
WAS PRETTY SPECIFIC.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.471
WE CONSIDERED THAT.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.518
I ALWAYS HAD A FEELING
ABOUT COLIN'S GIRLFRIEND--

16:37.518 --> 16:40.303
NOTHING SOLID, JUST A FEELING.DO YOU REMEMBER HER NAME?

16:40.303 --> 16:43.480
DIANE ZAR... ZARANSKI.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.178
YEAH.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.180
TALKED TO HER
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.920
WHEN'S THE RANSOM DROP?

16:48.920 --> 16:51.401
TONIGHT, 6:00.UH-HUH.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.447
THE NIGHT COLIN'S RANSOM
GOT PAID,

16:53.447 --> 16:57.625
I SAT WITH HIS PARENTS
TILL MORNING

16:57.625 --> 17:00.628
JUST WAITIN' TO HEAR
HE WAS SAFE.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.022
DON'T THINK WE SAID
TEN WORDS.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.376
[sighs]

17:09.376 --> 17:13.510
IF IT IS THE SAME PEOPLE
THAT TOOK COLIN,

17:13.510 --> 17:15.991
YOU DO THIS GIRL'S FAMILY
A FAVOR.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.471
MONEY DROPS AT 6:00.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.387
AT 6:01, YOU TELL THEM
THEIR CHILD IS DEAD,

17:20.387 --> 17:23.216
GIVE 'EM A CHANCE
TO GET USED TO IT.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.479
IT WOULD BE A KINDNESS.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.146
BOSS, I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.WHAT?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.539
THOSE SQUATTERS IN THE HOUSE
WHERE WE FOUND HAYMER?

17:42.539 --> 17:45.107
THEY WERE DRUG DEALERS.
A DETECTIVE IN OAKLAND NARCOTICS

17:45.107 --> 17:47.457
SAID THEY'RE AN EXTENDED
FAMILY--EIGHT OR TEN PEOPLE.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.459
THEY GREW POT ON A FARM
CALLED CRAZY HILL

17:49.459 --> 17:52.158
IN GOODHUE COUNTY,
BROUGHT IT INTO OAKLAND

17:52.158 --> 17:54.856
AND SOLD IT OUT OF THE HOUSE.AND THIS HAS TO DO
WITH COLIN HAYMER HOW?

17:54.856 --> 17:56.858
APPARENTLY,
THEY ALSO SOLD DRUGS

17:56.858 --> 17:59.078
THAT THEY BOUGHT
FROM BORDER CARTELS,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.428
ANDTHEY PICKED UP SOME
OF THE CARTELS' HABITS

18:01.428 --> 18:03.517
LIKE KIDNAPPING FOR CASH.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.563
SO THEY WENT FROM DEALING POT
TO KIDNAPPING WEALTHY KIDS?

18:06.563 --> 18:09.610
LESS EFFORT, MORE PROFIT.DO YOU HAVE ANY NAMES?

18:09.610 --> 18:11.612
THEY'RE KNOWN AS
THE CRAZY HILL GANG.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.962
ONE OF THE RINGLEADERS
WAS NICKNAMED "DEEZER."

18:13.962 --> 18:16.007
NOBODY KNOWS HIS REAL NAME.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.487
APPARENTLY,
DEEZER'S BEEN HANGING AROUND

18:17.487 --> 18:20.099
AN APARTMENT BUILDING
IN WEST OAKLAND.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.580
BOSS WANTS US TO CHECK
THE BUILDING OUT.FORGOT MY EXTRA MAGS.
MEET YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.582
[lowers voice] "EXTRA MAGS."
MM. BIG MAN.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.280
WHERE'S YOUR VEST?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.585
[normal voice]
DON'T NEED ONE.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.761
SURE YOU DO.WE'RE JUST CANVASSING.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.895
FOR PEOPLE CALLED
"THE CRAZY HILL GANG."

18:33.895 --> 18:35.940
YOU SHOULD WEAR A VEST.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.160
LOOK, IT'S HOT.
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.684
HICKS ISN'T WEARING ONE.

18:40.684 --> 18:44.819
[scoffs] WHAT, YOU'RE AFRAID
HE'LL MAKE FUN OF YOU?NO. NOT AT ALL.

18:44.819 --> 18:47.343
[elevator bell dings,
doors open]DON'T BE AN IDIOT.
PUT ON A VEST.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.483
FINE. GET SHOT.
SEE IF I CARE.

19:04.621 --> 19:07.755
[speaks indistinctly]
THERE YOU GO.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.583
ONE MORE?

19:09.583 --> 19:10.714
SHE LIKES YOU.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.325
SHE HAS GOOD TASTE.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.502
YOU'RE GOOD WITH CHILDREN.UNLIKE YOUR EMPLOYERS?

19:15.502 --> 19:18.461
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.OH, COME ON.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.724
IT'S CLEAR TO SEE THEY'RE
SKITTISH ABOUT THE PARENTING.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.466
I WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.425
VERONA'S LOW SELF-ESTEEM
MAKES HER DOUBT

19:25.425 --> 19:27.557
SHE'LL EVER BE A REAL PARENT.

19:27.557 --> 19:30.125
AND BECAUSE DUNCAN
MARRIED HER FOR HER MONEY,

19:30.125 --> 19:32.780
HE SEES THE CHILD
AS A RIVAL,

19:32.780 --> 19:35.565
IN MORE THAN
THE USUAL FREUDIAN TERM.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.915
THEY'RE VERY CARING PEOPLE,
VERY LOVING,

19:37.915 --> 19:41.528
JUST NOT PARTICULARLY HANDS-ON,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:41.528 --> 19:45.880
HOW'S DUNCAN'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH MIA?

19:45.880 --> 19:48.491
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.537
WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.

19:50.537 --> 19:54.105
IF HE SEES HIS CHILD AS A RIVAL,
WHY NOT HIS SISTER-IN-LAW?

19:54.105 --> 19:57.805
I'VE HEARD ANGRY WORDS
BETWEEN THEM.

19:57.805 --> 20:01.069
I THINK MIA
DOESN'T TRUST HIM.

20:01.069 --> 20:04.290
BUT I SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.292
NO.

20:06.292 --> 20:09.643
BUT YOU DID.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.862
JANE,
WE GOT AN ERRAND TO RUN.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.168
OKAY.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.344
ALL RIGHT.
[clears throat] GOTTA GO.

20:15.344 --> 20:18.913
GOTTA GO AND RUN AN ERRAND
WITH THE BIG, SERIOUS MAN.COME ON. LET'S GO.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.132
BYE.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.840
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE?

20:32.840 --> 20:36.017
WELL, THE TATTOO
ON THE KIDNAPPER'S ARM

20:36.017 --> 20:40.021
SUGGESTS THE, UH, MEXICAN MAFIA
MIGHT BE INVOLVED.MM-HMM.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.459
THOSE GUYS--THEY'RE MEMBERS.
SO WE'RE GONNA GO TALK TO 'EM.

20:43.459 --> 20:46.593
THEY LOOK SCARY.THEY ARE SCARY.

20:46.593 --> 20:50.031
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE A FULL MEMBER
UNTIL YOU'VE KILLED SOMEONE.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.775
MAYBE I'LL JUST WAIT
IN THE CAR.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.212
NO. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
I NEED YOU FOR BACKUP.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.350
BACKUP?

21:06.787 --> 21:09.572
HEY, FELLAS.

21:09.572 --> 21:12.836

21:18.712 --> 21:21.062

21:21.062 --> 21:23.194
I WAS WONDERING
IF ANY OF YOU FELLAS

21:23.194 --> 21:25.240
HAVE SEEN YOUR MAN SNOOPY?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.764
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
SNOOPY?

21:27.764 --> 21:29.679
SNOOP.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.334
WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR HIM.
WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.423
HEY, KEEP WALKIN', MAN.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.860
WHO ARE YOU?

21:36.860 --> 21:39.733
WHY ARE YOU BEING THAT WAY?
I ASKED YOU NICELY.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.649
I-I ASKED--THE NAME IS RAOUL,

21:42.649 --> 21:45.434
AND I AIN'T GOT NO WARRANTS,
SO BACK UP, FOOL.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.176
WELL, RAOUL, YOU AND ME
ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO HAVE

21:48.176 --> 21:52.006
A PRIVATE CHAT IN A MOMENT.NAH. I AIN'T DID NOTHING WRONG.

21:52.006 --> 21:55.923
DON'T MAKE IT DIFFICULT.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.665
TOUGH GUYS, HUH?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.580
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN
BY "TOUGH."

22:00.580 --> 22:02.495
EMOTIONALLY RESILIENT?
YES.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.280
SO NOW YOU
GONNA PLAY ME, TOO?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.629
OH, RAOUL!COME ON!

22:06.629 --> 22:08.849

A BIG SCORE'S COMING UP,

22:58.594 --> 23:00.509
I HEAR ABOUT IT.

23:00.509 --> 23:03.120
PEOPLE START BRAGGING EVEN
BEFORE THEY GOT THE MONEY.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.862
I AIN'T HEARD NOTHING

CERTAINLY A LESSON IN LIFE
ON THE MEAN STREETS.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.076
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S WHAT COPS DO.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.339
WE GET A LEAD,

24:31.339 --> 24:33.994
MOST LEADS DON'T WORK OUT.
WE MOVE ON.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.213
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT,
DO YOU?

24:36.213 --> 24:39.782
ALL THIS KIND OF HARD,
METHODICAL WORK WE DO

24:39.782 --> 24:43.394
IS SOMEHOW BENEATH YOU...
NOT YOUR SPEED.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.353
OH, PLEASE,
GET OFF YOUR HORSE.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.529
YOU JUST WANTED
TO FRIGHTEN ME AND IMPRESS ME

24:47.529 --> 24:50.663
WITH YOUR MACHO COP PROWESS--
UNDERSTANDABLE IMPULSE.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.969
A LITTLE JUVENILE, PERHAPS.

24:52.969 --> 24:56.190
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
WORKING WITH US.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.627
YOU'RE HURTING PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW THAT?

24:58.627 --> 25:00.281
WHO?

25:00.281 --> 25:02.544
THE COPS YOU WORK WITH.
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.546
THEIR CAREERS
ARE TAKING A HIT.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.418
IF YOU CARE ABOUT 'EM,
YOU'LL LEAVE.

25:07.418 --> 25:10.509
COPS I WORK WITH,
MEANING LISBON?AND HER TEAM.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.380
BUT MOSTLY LISBON.

25:12.380 --> 25:15.731
THAT RANSOM DEMAND--
DID SHE TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT?

25:15.731 --> 25:18.125
SURE.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.389
AND YES, IT COULD MEAN
THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE.

25:21.389 --> 25:24.044
BECAUSE USEFUL TO KNOW
WHO IT IS, DON'T YOU THINK?

25:24.044 --> 25:25.698
WELL, WE'RE WORKING THAT,

25:25.698 --> 25:28.265
BUT THE RANSOM DROP'S
IN THREE HOURS.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.267
WE MAKE A MOVE
ON A SUSPECT NOW,

25:30.267 --> 25:32.792
ALL IT'LL DO IS
SPOOK THE KIDNAPPERS.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.142
THEY'LL KILL MIA,
AND THEY'LL SCATTER.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.753
WE GOTTA MAKE SURE
THE GIRL IS SAFE.SHE'S NOT GONNA BE SAFE.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.582
THEY WILL KILL HER FIVE MINUTES
AFTER THEY GET THE RANSOM.COULD HAPPEN.

25:40.582 --> 25:43.846
SO SHE DIES EITHER WAY.
WE COULD TRY SOMETHING.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.719
NO.YOU WANT TO HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY?

25:46.719 --> 25:48.285
NOT INTERESTED.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.897
OKAY, SURE, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED,

25:50.897 --> 25:53.682
