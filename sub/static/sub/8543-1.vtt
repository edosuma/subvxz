00:02.785 --> 00:03.655
[Jane]
Previously on
"The Mentalist."

00:03.742 --> 00:04.656
- Patrick.
- Hey, Patrick.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.049
Lorelei.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.311
Perhaps we can
see each other again.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.748
I do what Red John
tells me to do.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.011
Accept his friendship.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
- It's that easy?
- Sure.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.491
And you'll need
to bring him a gift.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.232
What kind of gift?

00:15.319 --> 00:17.626
Teresa Lisbon's dead body
would be the perfect thing.

00:17.713 --> 00:18.844
[laughs]

00:18.931 --> 00:20.368
Good luck, Teresa.
Love you.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.415
Well, the question remains,
why did Jane do this?

00:24.502 --> 00:26.461
- Orders from Red John?
- I don't know what to think.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.376
I want arrest warrants prepped
for every single member

00:28.463 --> 00:30.291
of that CBI team,
dead or alive.

00:30.378 --> 00:31.944
FBI! Nobody move!

00:32.032 --> 00:34.034
CBI! Don't shoot!
We're CBI agents!

00:34.121 --> 00:35.035
You're making
a terrible mistake.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.601
- Get out.
- Got the gift?

00:36.688 --> 00:38.299
- Red John in there?
- Mm-hmm.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.432
Our fake deaths were a ruse
to trap Red John, and it worked.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.955
[Red John]
'What if you
and I were friends?'

00:43.043 --> 00:44.479
'Imagine the life
we could lead.'

00:44.566 --> 00:46.220
Go to hell.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.873
[dramatic music]

00:55.359 --> 00:56.752
You're gonna break down
and you're gonna tell us

00:56.839 --> 00:58.406
everything you know
about Red John.

00:58.493 --> 01:02.453
- You're gonna sing like a bird.
- No, lover. I won't.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.454
Yes, you will.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.675
Yes, you will.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.725
[intense music]

01:30.960 --> 01:32.788
[music continues]

01:35.312 --> 01:36.792
[door closes]

01:36.879 --> 01:38.663
[footsteps approaching]

01:40.970 --> 01:42.189
[Lisbon]
'We're up.'

01:42.276 --> 01:44.887
- What?
- We have a case.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.802
Now?

01:46.889 --> 01:49.109
You can't talk
to her yet anyhow.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.981
- 'The FBI won't let you.'
- I'll be right there.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.165
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

02:04.863 --> 02:06.952
[instrumental music]

02:11.740 --> 02:13.785
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

02:16.745 --> 02:19.008
You can't leave
your car there.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.184
Hey!

02:27.930 --> 02:30.062
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

02:30.150 --> 02:32.761
Hey, boys.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.719
- You the responding officer?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.591
- 'Officer Yannick'
- 'What have we got?'

02:36.678 --> 02:40.160
A 9-1-1 call came in
from this location, 7:33 p.m.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.162
'But, uh, nobody spoke.'

02:42.249 --> 02:45.861
Door was unlocked, and, uh,
this is how we found 'em.

02:45.948 --> 02:49.081
This is Rex Lango
and, uh, Callie Karlsen.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.433
They both worked together
at the hotel convention center.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.174
- Uh, this is her place.
- Mm.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.698
- So the door was already open?
- Yes, sir.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.395
I figure the marks
and bruising on the neck

02:58.482 --> 03:00.702
indicate strangulation
and, uh

03:00.789 --> 03:02.747
he got clubbed to death
with the bottle, huh?

03:02.834 --> 03:06.186
Yes. Nice analysis there,
Yannick.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.883
Couldn't have killed
each other, could they?

03:07.970 --> 03:09.754
Unlikely. She'd have to be
conscious and active

03:09.841 --> 03:11.234
to hit him
with that bottle.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.454
[Rigsby]
'Check out the lipstick
on his cheek.'

03:13.541 --> 03:15.195
So it's
your classic love triangle.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.458
'Third wheel comes in,
finds these two kissing'

03:17.545 --> 03:18.676
'whacks the rival
with the bubbly'

03:18.763 --> 03:20.156
'chokes out Jezebel here.'

03:20.243 --> 03:22.071
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I..

03:22.158 --> 03:24.334
...uh, figured. Yeah.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.683
Jane? Thoughts?

03:25.770 --> 03:28.120
Well, the champagne's
an excellent vintage.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.905
Callie didn't have
a steady boyfriend.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.950
Uh, no spare toothbrush.

03:32.037 --> 03:35.345
She believes poor soul
in a benevolent universe

03:35.432 --> 03:38.130
and she, uh,
comes from money.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.657
- 'Mm.'
- Money? She works in a hotel.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.485
[Lisbon]
'I've seen enough.
We're out of here.'

03:44.572 --> 03:46.226
'Let forensics do their job.'

03:48.532 --> 03:50.534
So, uh, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.276
- Thank you, Officer Yannick.
- You're welcome. My pleasure.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.756
[tires screech]

03:59.151 --> 04:00.805
What are you guys doing here?

04:02.024 --> 04:03.982
What are you doing here?

04:04.069 --> 04:06.507
Hey, Teresa.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.204
What's up? You're all under
suspension, aren't you?

04:08.291 --> 04:09.771
We were told
to cover your calls.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.773
Suspension? What?
Who are you guys?

04:11.860 --> 04:14.471
FBI. Walk away.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.647
You didn't hear? The suspensions
have been lifted.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.170
The brass made a deal.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.955
Yeah, we heard
that they were talking.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.478
They put a lid
on the whole thing.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.698
It's business as usual.
Suspension's lifted.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.613
So you guys don't need
to be here.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.049
Look, I'm sorry
for the mix-up.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.616
Wait. Wait.
You mean to tell me

04:28.703 --> 04:31.271
that after the monumental
crap storm you guys created

04:31.358 --> 04:33.621
they're just gonna
let you walk away?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.753
- I'm stunned, frankly.
- I understand.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.191
I mean, you destroyed
the career of a fine FBI agent.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.193
You-you caused the death
of your own boss.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.499
And this one?

04:42.586 --> 04:44.022
This one's got assault,
narcotics

04:44.109 --> 04:45.241
'and fraud charges
against him.'

04:45.328 --> 04:47.591
All dismissed.
Part of the deal. Phew.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.463
How'd you get
such a sweet deal?

04:49.550 --> 04:52.335
Uh, we got a deal because, uh,
it was the FBI that messed up

04:52.422 --> 04:53.380
not me or the CBI.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.816
- The FBI.
- That's right.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.384
- That's incorrect.
- Oh, touche.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.560
We were this close to catching
Red John before you blew it.

04:59.647 --> 05:00.952
And even in spite
of your interference

05:01.039 --> 05:02.650
we caught Lorelei Martins,
so she's our--

05:02.737 --> 05:04.129
She's our suspect,
and we want her back.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.217
You're not getting her.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.091
Oh, we'll see about that.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.180
- We'll see.
- We'll see?

05:11.267 --> 05:12.964
Your inarticulate rage

05:13.051 --> 05:14.314
is understandable
but it's misplaced.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.446
You should probably
just calm down.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.405
You calm yourself down.
I'm not angry.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.058
No? Your temples
are pulsing

05:20.145 --> 05:22.234
like some weird
undersea creature.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.280
If that's not anger,
you should see a doctor.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.368
[Lisbon]
'Jane, stop.'

05:25.455 --> 05:27.588
Okay, I'm going.
Nice to see you.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.330
Watch this one.
He's a hothead.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.418
I am sorry.
He does that.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.507
- I'm not angry.
- I believe you.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.812
I just think you people
should be in jail

05:34.899 --> 05:36.161
not out working cases.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.554
- That's right.
- But we're not in jail.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.295
We're here,
so keep moving.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.950
Or else what,
you're gonna make us move?

05:42.037 --> 05:43.255
If you like.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.867
[laughs]
Then go ahead.
Make me move.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.521
Alright, that's enough.
You're both being childish.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.261
- You take your hands off!
- Hey! Hey!

05:49.349 --> 05:51.786
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Come on.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.397
Break it up!

05:54.484 --> 05:55.659
[Yannick]
'Come on. Let it go..'

05:55.746 --> 05:57.531
- Sorry.
- 'That's it!'

05:58.836 --> 06:00.011
[indistinct shouting]

06:00.098 --> 06:01.926
I'll see you
back at the office.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.060
- 'Knock it off!'
- 'Come on!'

06:05.147 --> 06:06.191
Get off!

06:06.278 --> 06:07.802
[instrumental music]

06:16.419 --> 06:17.681
[instrumental music]

06:23.557 --> 06:25.646
- Welcome back.
- Thank you so much.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.343
I could not be less happy
to be back.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.868
Uh...I'd like

06:30.955 --> 06:32.043
to take this opportunity

06:32.130 --> 06:33.654
to thank you for, uh..

06:33.741 --> 06:34.916
...fixing things.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.352
Yes, sir. We--

06:36.439 --> 06:39.529
You know, I thought
I had, as you say

06:39.616 --> 06:42.314
fixed things, and now
I discover that you

06:42.402 --> 06:45.927
and your FBI counterparts
have been fighting?

06:46.014 --> 06:47.668
- At crime scene?
- Sir, it was--

06:47.755 --> 06:50.061
IfI can persuade
the FBI

06:50.148 --> 06:51.715
to forget this latest
incident

06:51.802 --> 06:55.153
you, Jane, are down to
your very last chance.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.764
A-and you are only
granted this chance

06:56.851 --> 06:58.548
because to get rid of you now
would be evidence

06:58.635 --> 07:00.507
of the scandal we are trying
so hard to conceal!

07:02.509 --> 07:05.773
Looking on the bright side,
we have Lorelei Martins.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.905
'She can lead us
to Red John.'

07:07.992 --> 07:09.733
She knows who he is.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.387
California's most notorious
serial killer

07:11.474 --> 07:12.649
caught on your watch.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.521
Well, that remains
to be seen.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.784
But until I negotiate
an arrangement with the feds

07:16.871 --> 07:18.481
you cannottalk to her.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.701
- That's the deal!
- I understand.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.529
But here's the thing.
The FBI can't have her.

07:22.616 --> 07:25.009
In a half an hour, I have to
stand up at a press conference

07:25.096 --> 07:26.794
and lie to the people
of California

07:26.881 --> 07:30.232
in order to protect you,and you
are arguing with me now?

07:30.319 --> 07:31.886
They can't have her.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.540
I will do my best
to keep her, but you have--

07:33.627 --> 07:35.846
I promise, uh, there'll be
no more trouble from me.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.457
I-I won't say a word
at this press conference.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.936
You're damn right you won't
say a word

07:39.023 --> 07:40.285
'cause you won't be there!

07:41.243 --> 07:43.245
[instrumental music]

07:45.377 --> 07:46.814
[Bertram]
'Agent Schultz!'

07:47.467 --> 07:49.033
'Alexa.'

07:49.120 --> 07:50.861
[chuckles]
Hi.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.820
We still have a deal,
right?

07:52.907 --> 07:55.431
I'd rather eat spiders,
but, yeah, we still have a deal.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.824
Good, good.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.826
God, you look fabulous,
by the way.

07:58.913 --> 08:02.046
Camera ready.
Is-is my tie straight?

08:02.133 --> 08:04.788
You understand, Gale,
this matter doesn't end here.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.008
You have to give us
Lorelei Martins

08:07.095 --> 08:08.618
or there'll be consequences
down the line.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.752
Consequences for whom?

08:11.839 --> 08:14.189
It was your agents that killed
the best chance we've had yet

08:14.276 --> 08:15.625
of catching Red John.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.366
It was your agent Darcy
that killed Wainwright.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.543
Tragic outcome
in a deadly force situation.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.414
Agent Darcy is devastated.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.286
She's had a nervous collapse,
in fact.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.897
Your people committed
deliberate crimes.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.943
Well, that's debatable.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.553
Look!
We have agreed to a cover-up.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.860
That's the deal.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.688
If you're saying now that

08:34.775 --> 08:37.255
you're gonna dig this all up
again unless I do your bidding

08:37.342 --> 08:39.344
then no deal.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.825
No, let-let's
tell the truth right now.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.219
An FBI agent shot and killed
a CBI agent

08:44.306 --> 08:45.960
in the midst
of a botched operation.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.658
It'll be a huge scandal,
we'll probably lose our jobs

08:48.745 --> 08:50.660
but I'm sure we'll both
feel better for it.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.054
Some bitch.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.927
I am very proud to tell you
that last week

08:57.014 --> 08:59.321
in a joint FBI, CBI
sting operation

08:59.408 --> 09:01.584
'of great complexity
and danger'

09:01.671 --> 09:03.630
Lorelei Martins, a close
associate

09:03.717 --> 09:05.196
of notorious serial killer

09:05.283 --> 09:07.677
Red John, was arrested.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.027
'Tragically, in the course
of that operation'

09:10.114 --> 09:12.595
CBI special agent in charge
Luthor Wainwright

09:12.682 --> 09:16.033
was shot and killed.
Gale?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.906
Luthor Wainwright
was a good friend

09:18.993 --> 09:23.606
a valued colleague, and we all
mourn his passing deeply.

09:23.693 --> 09:24.607
He's a hero.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.001
'As part
of the sting operation'

09:27.088 --> 09:29.046
'one of our operatives,
Patrick Jane'

09:29.133 --> 09:31.571
had criminal charges
fabricated against him

09:31.658 --> 09:33.355
in order to go undercover.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.837
And we apologize to the public
for that deception.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.534
Today, the story is
of the great job done

09:38.621 --> 09:41.493
by these two teams
of consummate professionals

09:41.581 --> 09:43.017
working together in harmony.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.888
[Bertram]
'Questions?'

09:44.975 --> 09:48.326
This working in harmony business
is very hard to believe.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.851
There's a very long public
history of disharmony

09:50.938 --> 09:52.069
between your two bureaus.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.202
That's why they call it
history, Josh.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.421
- It's in the past.
- Exactly.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.207
What we're celebrating today
is the dawn of a new era.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.687
'Just this morning,
these two teams'

10:00.774 --> 10:02.384
began work on another
case together.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.908
A double murder
in Dupont Gardens.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.997
Best of luck on that one, guys.
Go get 'em.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.044
[instrumental music]

10:15.963 --> 10:17.747
Let's call it a truce,
shall we, guys?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.706
I mean, we're all
grownups here.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.577
- Yep, sure.
- Yeah.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.711
- Nice place.
- It is.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.458
This is like a bad date.

10:33.545 --> 10:34.982
I wish these bozos
would just vanish.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.248
Wow. Four cops.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.467
[chuckles]
Must be a red ball, huh?

10:42.554 --> 10:44.252
A red ball?

10:44.339 --> 10:46.297
Well, that's what you guys
call an urgent case, right?

10:46.384 --> 10:49.910
- All murder cases are urgent.
- Yes, of course. I..

10:49.997 --> 10:51.563
[sighs]
I would never imply
otherwise. I--

10:51.651 --> 10:53.696
What can you tell us
about Callie and Rex?

10:53.783 --> 10:57.004
Um, Callie has been with us
two years as a housekeeper.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.267
Reliable. Always upbeat.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.225
Really, uh, just
a lovely girl.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.663
Well, a woman, that is.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.187
Uh, Rex Lango
I don't know so well.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.667
He's only been here
a couple weeks

11:07.754 --> 11:10.104
and, uh, works over
in tech support.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.932
But he seems like, you know,
a good fellow.

11:12.019 --> 11:12.976
He..
Uh, punctual.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.762
Were they friends? Lovers?

11:15.849 --> 11:17.502
Uh, well, I wouldn't know.

11:17.589 --> 11:20.680
Um, you know, you should
check with their workmates.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.116
[Lisbon]
'You and Callie were close?'

11:22.203 --> 11:23.944
Yes, me and Callie
were friends.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.381
She was such a good,
kind person.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.122
Poor thing.
Oh, my God.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.037
Did she have any boyfriend
troubles that you know of?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.429
Nuh-unh. Men were always
asking her out

11:31.516 --> 11:33.127
but she would always
say no.

11:33.214 --> 11:36.043
- Was anybody bothering her?
- Not that she told me.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.436
What was her relationship
with Rex Lango?

11:38.523 --> 11:39.873
- None, I don't think.
- Hmm.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.573
What about Mr. Norris?
Did he have a thing for Callie?

11:44.660 --> 11:46.183
Oh, you think Mr. Norris?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.798
He would ogle her. But he did
that to all the women.

11:51.885 --> 11:56.541
Ogle them and, you know,
cop a feel sometimes.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.327
He always asks people out,
but nobody says yes

11:59.414 --> 12:01.590
because he had a girlfriend
once who worked here

12:01.677 --> 12:04.158
and they broke up,
and he fired her butt so fast.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.812
- Hmm.
- You think he did this?

12:07.509 --> 12:08.728
[instrumental music]

12:10.730 --> 12:12.253
- Did you get anything useful?
- Nope.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.994
- You?
- Nope.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.517
[cell phone ringing]
Be right back.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.650
Nah, nothing useful.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.783
Uh, excuse me.
Mr. Norris?

12:20.870 --> 12:23.438
Uh, thank you so much for
your help in the investigation.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.832
I just have a couple more
questions before we go.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.748
Um...how many employees
are you responsible for

12:28.835 --> 12:30.401
here at the hotel?

12:30.488 --> 12:34.014
- I supervise 210 employees.
- Wow. That is a lot.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.363
Have you ever seen
your mother naked?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.408
What? No!

12:37.495 --> 12:38.583
Well, we'll leave that alone
for a moment.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.281
Let me ask you this.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.893
Have you ever looked at
Callie Karlsen in a sexual way?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.590
No!

12:45.677 --> 12:48.855
I mean, you know,
she's an attractive...woman.

12:48.942 --> 12:52.467
- Sure.
- I didn't look away.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.904
So, yes, you looked at her
sexually.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.776
- Uh, have you touched her?
- No!

12:58.603 --> 13:00.475
Why are you shielding
your right side?

13:00.562 --> 13:01.737
Are you hiding something?

13:01.824 --> 13:03.130
Hiding? I'm not hiding
anything!

13:03.217 --> 13:05.349
Something. Your-your
inside jacket pocket

13:05.436 --> 13:06.655
is making you nervous.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.004
- No!
- What do you have in there?

13:08.091 --> 13:10.659
Uh, w..
nothing. Oh. Okay. A wallet.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.314
Wh-why are you wanting
to hide your wallet from us?

13:13.401 --> 13:15.838
I don't.
It's just a wallet.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.971
- Hey, you can't do that.
- It's a gray area.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.755
Okay, there's nothing
in there.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.366
Well, lookee here.
Callie Karlsen.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.846
That's our girl, isn't it?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.630
Couldn't resist
a souvenir, huh?

13:25.717 --> 13:29.112
Okay. I have never
seen that before in my life.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.593
Really? Has this wallet been
out of your possession recently?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.291
[sighs]
No, but I swear,
I-I've never seen that before.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.597
I swear to God.

13:35.684 --> 13:36.946
Well, I tell you what,
Mr. Norris.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.208
Why don't we talk some more
downtown

13:38.295 --> 13:39.644
see if we can solve
this mystery?

13:39.731 --> 13:42.125
No. No, no, no. No, no.
I've got a hotel to run.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.953
- I cannot--
- Whoa, whoa! Wait a second.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.173
- He's our suspect.
- Looks like he's ours to me.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.783
No, no. That's not fair.

13:47.870 --> 13:51.178
Fair? What are you,
seven years old? Fair!

13:51.265 --> 13:53.006
Tell you what.
You give us Lorelei Martins

13:53.093 --> 13:54.007
we'll give you this guy.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.663
That's fair.
No? Okay. Bye-bye.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.538
Bastards.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.976
Hey, no need to be
so grumpy. You got your wish.

14:07.063 --> 14:10.850
You wanted them to vanish?
Vanished.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.374
What is so funny?
They took our suspect.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.679
No, they took
theirsuspect.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.116
Norris isn't our man?

14:16.203 --> 14:18.422
Small hands,
addicted to routine.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.947
No way a man like that
strangles a woman on impulse.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.600
- But the photos in his wallet--
- Planted.

14:22.687 --> 14:23.645
I took them
from Callie's apartment

14:23.732 --> 14:25.429
for just such an occasion.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.736
You know full well that is
illegal in 20 different ways.

14:27.823 --> 14:28.911
Oh..

14:28.998 --> 14:30.217
What about your promise
to Bertram?

14:30.304 --> 14:31.827
I had my fingers crossed.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.743
Didn't you wish for Mancini
and Smith to just disappear?

14:34.830 --> 14:37.877
Well, voila,your wish
was granted, like magic.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
Now we can focus
on catching the real killer

14:40.009 --> 14:41.663
while the FBI's
dealing with Norris.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.751
That is not the point.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.537
[instrumental music]

14:46.624 --> 14:47.930
[Lisbon]
'We're supposed
to be rebuilding'

14:48.017 --> 14:49.758
'our relationship
with the FBI.'

14:49.845 --> 14:52.413
- Rebuilding trust.
- Trust is not an option.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.632
Red John has a friend
inside the FBI.

14:54.719 --> 14:58.158
If they get hold of Lorelei,
she will die or escape.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.247
Oh, God, here we go.
How do you know that?

15:00.334 --> 15:02.075
Red John told me.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.295
Well, he was lying, of course,
to muddy the waters.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.818
Why would he tell you
the truth?

15:06.906 --> 15:10.648
Because he knows we'll assume
he's lying.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.869
And he knows we'll begin
to suspect the truth anyway.

15:13.956 --> 15:17.699
It's a double bluff
to conceal his friend.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.136
Or he's lying and he has
no friend in the FBI.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.746
Why are you so determined
to believe that?

15:21.833 --> 15:24.358
Because I would like to feel
solid ground under my feet.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.534
I would like to trust
somebody or something.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.840
You know, you, with your
wheels within wheels..

15:28.928 --> 15:30.712
You're driving me nuts.

15:35.325 --> 15:35.935
[instrumental music]

15:38.633 --> 15:40.069
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Grace.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.072
Where are we with Karlsen
and Lango?

15:43.159 --> 15:44.813
Uh, looked into
the phone records.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.815
No calls in or out
for Lango that evening.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.905
Callie Karlsen called
Nicola Karlsen at 7:15

15:49.992 --> 15:51.689
eighteen minutes before
the 911 call.

15:51.776 --> 15:54.083
Hey, boss. Where's the FBI?

15:54.170 --> 15:56.346
They are pursuing
other inquiries.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.869
Sweet!

15:57.957 --> 16:00.960
Listen to me.
The FBI is a fine organization

16:01.047 --> 16:02.004
and they are our partners.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.701
We need to work with them.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.878
They deserve our respect
and our trust. Am I clear?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.097
Yeah.

16:12.928 --> 16:16.105
- Did you contact the sister?
- Yes. She lives out in Boone.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.238
She was out of contact for two
days at a swap meet in Tahoe.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.891
Got home this morning.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.633
- Local sheriff gave the news.
- What's her story?

16:22.720 --> 16:26.115
Oh, the Karlsen Family used
to own half of Alameda County.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.899
Lost it all
in the crash of '06

16:27.987 --> 16:31.164
parents died a year later,
highway collision.

16:31.251 --> 16:34.732
Nicola is the older sister.
Single mom, two kids.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.778
Jewelry designer is what
it says on her IRS forms.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.998
- What about Lango?
- Moved to town from L.A.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.477
Six months ago.
No rap sheet on him.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.218
'No relatives
or friends nearby.'

16:42.305 --> 16:43.567
We went through his apartment.
Nothing.

16:43.654 --> 16:44.873
Bare bones.
Mattress on the floor.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.527
Running from something,
maybe?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.964
Keep digging on Lango.
It sounds promising.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.010
Jane and I will go
talk to the sister.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.750
You two go and canvass
the crime scene

16:52.837 --> 16:54.796
like you should have instead
of fighting with the FBI!

16:56.450 --> 16:58.365
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.149
[instrumental music]

17:05.937 --> 17:07.461
[indistinct chattering]

17:09.419 --> 17:11.030
[Rigsby]
'Hey, Yannick.'

17:11.117 --> 17:13.249
- Agents.
- Thanks for your help.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.685
No problemo.

17:14.772 --> 17:15.773
Just don't hit me, okay?

17:16.818 --> 17:18.254
Funny.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.301
Hey, no offense,
but...I never saw that before.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.781
Law enforcement agents
fighting it out in the street?

17:23.868 --> 17:25.740
[laughs]
You guys are hard-core, man!

17:29.265 --> 17:32.355
[sighs]
Yes. Uh, so, anyway,
we started canvassing already.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.575
Nothing useful so far.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.098
Let's check out
the rest of tem.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.362
[instrumental music]

17:43.497 --> 17:45.847
Alright. Thank you very much
for your time. Appreciate it.

17:45.934 --> 17:48.502
[music continues]

17:53.159 --> 17:55.596
[indistinct chattering]

17:55.683 --> 17:57.119
Saw a young fellow
over there.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.382
Same one they've
been showing on the TV.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.862
Got beat to death.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.690
And you saw
just one man?

18:02.777 --> 18:04.300
- Rex Lango?
- Yes, sir.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.476
Knocking on her door
about 6:30.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.218
We were sitting out in the sun,
then we came inside.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.959
Did you ever see him
around here before?

18:11.046 --> 18:12.743
No, first time.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.355
She didn't have
visitors much.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.792
And then later we heard
a scream from over that way.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.403
Just a little short one,
like, uh, "Aah!"

18:23.319 --> 18:25.016
And you weren't concerned?

18:25.104 --> 18:29.543
Well, no. At the time, I thought
it was you know, passion.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.241
I said to Bucky,
"Good for her.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.548
That Karlsen girl
got a boyfriend at last."

18:34.635 --> 18:36.027
And what time was this?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.638
I know what time it was
because we were checking

18:37.725 --> 18:39.205
our lottery tickets
on the TV.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.598
It was ten past seven.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.949
Here's me thinking
her luck had changed

18:45.036 --> 18:47.126
when really, she was dying.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.259
Poor girl.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.392
[instrumental music]

19:08.451 --> 19:10.845
Hell. Nicola Karlsen?

19:10.932 --> 19:14.283
Hi.
Um, you must be the CBI.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.719
We're very sorry
for your loss.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.637
Uh, girls, could you maybe
take the boys to your place

19:20.724 --> 19:22.073
'watch some TV or something?'

19:22.161 --> 19:24.728
Sure. Come on, guys.
Let's go.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.600
[crows cawing]

19:28.471 --> 19:31.779
I was at a crafts fair
in the Sierras.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.129
The hippie geniuses in charge
picked a place

19:34.216 --> 19:37.263
with great vibes
and no cell phone reception.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.613
So, I didn't
get this message.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.268
[Callie]
'Nic! Call me
as soon as you can!'

19:44.400 --> 19:47.273
I didn't get that call till
last night when I came home.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.276
Then I called her,
and called..

19:50.363 --> 19:53.148
...and called, and then the
sheriff came by this morning.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.324
[clears throat]

19:55.411 --> 19:57.587
[Lisbon]
'Nicola, tell us
about your sister.'

19:57.674 --> 20:00.373
To be honest, we haven't found
a motive yet.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.725
Who would want to hurt
Callie?

20:04.812 --> 20:07.467
I mean, she was a warm, happy
spirit. Everybody loved her.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.686
'Did she have any failed
relationships in her past?'

20:09.773 --> 20:11.297
No.

20:11.384 --> 20:14.430
What about feuds with neighbors
or financial disputes?

20:14.517 --> 20:16.127
Maybe somebody
who felt burned

20:16.215 --> 20:17.694
when your family's business
went under?

20:17.781 --> 20:20.697
We paid off all the debts.
All of them.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.700
That's why I'm here
doing this, a..

20:23.787 --> 20:26.094
And Callie was cleaning rooms
instead of going to college.

20:27.617 --> 20:28.966
Wow, you make some
beautiful things here.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.055
Thank you.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.796
Do you know Rex Lango?

20:32.883 --> 20:34.581
[inhales]
Is that the man
who died with her?

20:36.322 --> 20:38.062
No, I've never heard
the name before.

20:38.149 --> 20:41.065
Well, it seems that, uh,
Callie and Rex were, uh

20:41.152 --> 20:44.939
about to drink a very nice
vintage champagne, 1975.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.681
About, uh, 500 bucks
a bottle, I'd guess.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.770
At least.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.467
That was the last
from my dad's cellar.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.123
There's no way Callie'd take it
out of the fridge herself.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.430
She'd been saving
that bottle for years

20:57.517 --> 21:00.520
for a special occasion,
like a talisman.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.392
She would have told you
if there was a relationship

21:03.479 --> 21:05.394
brewing
with her and Lango?

21:05.481 --> 21:07.570
Yes. Absolutely.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.139
We're very close.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.184
Callie was not interested
in finding a man.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.362
She wanted to go to college
first and get her career going.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.713
And what kind of career
did she want?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.410
[exhales]
She had all kinds
of big hopes.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.675
She was the optimist
of the two of us.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.895
She always said our luck
was gonna turn somehow.

21:29.984 --> 21:30.985
[chuckles]
I always said..

21:32.334 --> 21:34.249
"Don't hold your breath."

21:34.336 --> 21:35.946
[phone rings]

21:36.033 --> 21:37.208
Oh, sorry.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.124
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.954
- Hello?
- 'There's good news, Jane.'

21:44.041 --> 21:45.782
The FBI folded
on Lorelei Martins.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.393
- 'She's all yours.'
- Folded?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.090
Well, that's not like them.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.875
- You want her or not?
- Yes. I'm on my way.

21:56.053 --> 21:57.577
[dramatic music]

22:00.623 --> 22:02.233
Uh, we need to go soon.

22:05.236 --> 22:08.065
That's all for now,
Nicola.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.416
But I want you to know
we're gonna do everything

22:10.503 --> 22:12.287
we can to bring whoever
did this to justice.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.593
Yes, we sure will.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.551
I don't really care
who did this.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.597
Justice for them
won't help Callie or me.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.732
[sighs]
That was rude.
I'm sorry.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.430
It's your job. I'm sure
you do it very well.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.171
No apology needed.
You make a very valid point.

22:27.258 --> 22:30.479
Can I ask you, how much
is this particular one?

22:34.657 --> 22:37.268
- What are you thinking?
- She's ready to crack.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.358
Nicola?

22:39.445 --> 22:40.620
Lorelei.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.186
I meant,
what are you thinking

22:42.273 --> 22:43.797
of the case
we're working on now?

22:43.884 --> 22:45.929
Well, that one's a puzzler,
isn't it?

22:46.016 --> 22:47.366
What the hell is the motive?

22:47.453 --> 22:49.933
I don't think it was
the sister. I like her.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.892
So did you buy that bracelet
for Lorelei?

22:51.979 --> 22:53.589
- No, just a whim.
- Mmm.

22:53.676 --> 22:54.808
I liked it.

22:57.027 --> 22:59.465
When I talk to her,
I need to be alone.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.336
You will be.

23:01.423 --> 23:05.122
I mean, with nobody
watching or listening.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.909
I need to be able
to tell her truthfully

23:08.996 --> 23:10.606
that we are alone.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.092
- Okay.
- Thank you.

23:18.179 --> 23:19.746
Just be careful.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.226
And don't get pulled
into her game.

23:22.313 --> 23:25.055
- What game is that?
- I don't know. You tell me.

23:25.142 --> 23:28.276
Well, I'm supposed to tell you
a game that you're thinking of?

23:28.363 --> 23:31.801
Okay. Uh, you're thinking
of, uh, twister?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.281
Go ahead. Laugh.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.022
Uh, but she's practically
the first person

23:35.109 --> 23:37.851
since your wife that
you've, you know..

23:37.938 --> 23:39.635
Oh!

23:39.722 --> 23:42.464
It wouldn't be surprising
if you had feelings for her.

23:42.551 --> 23:45.206
She's a stepping stone
to Red John.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.425
I knew that
from the beginning.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.818
I don't have any feelings
for her.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.389
[dramatic music]

24:05.792 --> 24:08.098
Hello, Patrick.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.492
Lorelei.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.277
Is it just us,
or are your friends listening?

24:13.364 --> 24:15.366
[Jane]
'It's just us.
We're alone.'

24:15.454 --> 24:17.978
[Lorelei]
'Good, it's much nicer
that way.'

24:23.897 --> 24:25.899
Sorry, I didn't come
to visit you sooner.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.988
I've been a little busy
with a case.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.555
It's okay.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.731
I've been enjoying
the peace and quiet.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.907
Is there anything you need?

24:33.994 --> 24:35.604
I'm fine.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.041
Never mind about me.
How are you?

24:38.128 --> 24:40.261
'Back to solving crimes, huh?'

24:40.348 --> 24:42.132
Yeah.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.221
Mmm.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.528
Why do you bother?

24:46.615 --> 24:49.226
You're trying to hold back
the tide with a broom.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.619
What good are you doing?

24:52.752 --> 24:56.973
I think you do it to be close
to Teresa Lisbon.

24:58.758 --> 25:01.108
'I think you're a little bit
in love with her.'

25:01.195 --> 25:03.371
[Jane chuckles]
'Hmm.'

25:06.330 --> 25:07.897
I-I do it to, uh..

25:09.464 --> 25:10.639
...pass the time.

25:12.598 --> 25:13.947
What good are you doing?

25:15.252 --> 25:16.776
Not much in here.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.952
But I'll be out soon enough.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.128
How and when
is up to Red John.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.521
You think he'll get you
out of this?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.437
He'll kill you.
It's easier.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.657
That's okay,
if that's what he wants.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.094
You're that far
under his control?

25:31.181 --> 25:34.402
He'll kill you as well
if that's what he wants.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.925
You just can't accept
the fact.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.884
I can make you a better offer.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.625
No killing.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.628
I can get you out of here now.
Today, if you want.

25:42.715 --> 25:46.066
I get you money,
a new identity, uh..

25:46.153 --> 25:49.199
Set you up with a new life
far away from here.

25:49.286 --> 25:50.418
[Lorelei]
'You can do that?'

25:50.505 --> 25:52.812
[Jane]
'Yes, I can.'

25:52.899 --> 25:55.641
I can do anything you want
if you give me Red John.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.693
I want..

26:04.780 --> 26:06.652
...your trust

26:06.739 --> 26:08.392
and friendship.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.655
You have that.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.744
I don't believe you.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.049
How can I make you believe?

26:16.357 --> 26:17.576
Kiss me.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.317
What does that prove?

26:20.404 --> 26:22.232
[chuckles]

26:22.319 --> 26:25.801
[sighs]
First you say
you'll do anything I want.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.761
Then you refuse
the first thing I ask for.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.458
You're very complicated.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.375
[dramatic music]

26:41.077 --> 26:42.557
Let me get you out of here.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.084
I need time to think.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.870
Not for long,
I don't know how much longer

26:50.957 --> 26:52.393
we're gonna get
to keep you here.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.918
We'll talk again
this evening.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.404
[elevator bell dings]

27:06.755 --> 27:08.670
What are you? Huh?
Crazy?

27:08.757 --> 27:10.933
- Excuse me?
- I told you to be careful.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.500
I told you not to go
over the edge.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.981
- And I told you not to listen.
- Don't be childish.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.157
I am not your girlfriend.
I am an officer of the law.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.549
How could I not listen?

27:20.247 --> 27:22.902
You kissed her. You offered
to help her escape.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.165
And I would ask her to marry me
if I thought she'd buy it.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.907
- I was playing her.
- She's playing you.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.735
We should have given her
to the feds.

27:39.483 --> 27:43.487
Um, ME sent his report
on Callie and Rex.

27:43.574 --> 27:46.055
Confirmed it's not possible
they killed each other.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.883
And Callie had
a small white feather

27:47.970 --> 27:49.232
lodged in the back
of her mouth.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.061
- A feather? Like from a pillow?
- Right.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.847
Which suggests Callie
was strangled by hand

27:54.934 --> 27:58.111
and suffocated with a pillow,
probably in that order.

27:58.198 --> 28:00.591
Why two methods?
Two different people?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.810
Or the killer
wasn't strong enough

28:01.897 --> 28:02.855
to complete the strangulation.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.508
- Right.
- A woman?

28:04.595 --> 28:06.032
Women can strangle people.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.686
Oh, believe me,
I know I could.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.252
Where's Cho and Rigsby?

28:09.339 --> 28:12.516
I got a line on Rex Lango
finally. Changed his name.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.084
Used to be Erzat Lonagul
out of Bakersfield.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.957
Cho and Rigsby drove down there
to speak to his family.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.437
[instrumental music]

28:26.617 --> 28:28.402
Nobody could say his name.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.534
So he changed it to Rex.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.928
He was gonna be
a big businessman.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.802
And he thought that
sounded rich. Rex Lango.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.152
Was there any particular
business he was interested in?

28:39.239 --> 28:41.371
You know, he was good
at computers.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.983
But he didn't know yet
exactly.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.812
The internet, robots..

28:46.899 --> 28:48.117
'...or whatever.'

28:48.204 --> 28:49.728
Any brushes with the law?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.599
- Shady friends?
- No.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.557
My cousin was a good man.

28:53.644 --> 28:54.733
Ah!

28:54.820 --> 28:55.951
He wasa good man.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.214
And he's gone now,
so be nice.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.042
He was a bum.

29:00.129 --> 29:02.479
He was not.
He nearly always had a job.

29:02.566 --> 29:05.004
And he was never
in trouble with the law.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.267
Is that a bum?

29:07.354 --> 29:10.487
He was never in trouble
because he was too sneaky.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.707
The kid was stealing
candy and quarters

29:12.794 --> 29:14.665
'from before he could walk.'

29:14.753 --> 29:17.451
And then, he would lie
to your face like a rug seller.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.758
He was a dog
to the women always.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.324
A bum.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.630
[sighs]

29:27.026 --> 29:30.116
Scheming, dishonest,
greedy, selfish womanizer.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.074
Yeah, but not a criminal.
Just a creep.

29:32.161 --> 29:35.208
[Cho]
'He left Bakersfield two years
ago to avoid a paternity suit.'

29:35.295 --> 29:36.818
They had no idea
he was in Sac.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.298
Last they heard,
he was in LA.

29:38.385 --> 29:39.995
Hmm, that's interesting.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.954
So like I said,
it's a love triangle.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.607
But we've got
no jealous boyfriend

29:43.694 --> 29:46.132
and I can't see Callie
dating a sleaze like him.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.395
And she logged no calls
or texts to him, right?

29:48.482 --> 29:51.006
Nope. I'm waiting
for her e-mail records.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.399
I couldn't get them
direct from her PC.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.967
- The hard drive is fried.
- Oh!

29:55.054 --> 29:57.012
Well, that's why
he was there.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.840
'He was in tech support, right?'

29:58.927 --> 30:01.451
So he offers to fix her
computer. How could she refuse?

30:01.538 --> 30:03.410
- And then what happened?
- 'I don't know.'

30:03.497 --> 30:05.760
I gotta run. Lorelei's
on her way up from holding.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.372
Wait.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.115
We still haven't resolved
our issue.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.291
I don't think you should be
talking to Lorelei.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.684
- You're too close.
- Well, I disagree.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.425
I could put a stop
to this right now.

30:18.512 --> 30:21.123
- One word to Bertram about--
- Please don't do that.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.864
I know I can turn her.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.431
I know I can.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.476
And I promise you
I will be careful.

30:32.613 --> 30:33.701
[whispers]
Thank you.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.270
[elevator bell dings]

30:41.100 --> 30:42.753
- Hello.
- Hey.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.234
Stand down, man. I'm taking
charge of this prisoner.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.583
[Jane]
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?

30:46.670 --> 30:47.933
This is a federal judge's
warrant

30:48.020 --> 30:49.108
transferring custody
of Lorelei to the FBI.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.544
No, no, no.
You can't do that.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.067
- Back off.
- No, don't touch me, you..

30:52.154 --> 30:53.764
- Hang on.
- Let's go.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.766
- 'Please stay back, sir.'
- Don't let them take me.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.377
- Patrick.
- You can't just take her.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.770
- Patrick.
- Come on. Back it up.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.033
[Lorelei]
'Patrick!'

31:05.733 --> 31:06.821
There isn't a choice.
We have to get her back.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.171
Jane, the FBI outfoxed us.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.913
Th-they only pretended
to give up Lorelei

31:12.000 --> 31:13.872
while they were preparing
the warrant to take her.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.612
'We-we should have known
they wouldn't fold.'

31:15.699 --> 31:17.005
Just deal with it.

31:17.092 --> 31:19.486
I-I'd have to strong-arm
a judge and the FBI

31:19.573 --> 31:21.009
into an arbitration hearing,
and even then..

31:21.096 --> 31:22.489
Well, do it.

31:22.576 --> 31:24.839
The FBI know how
to interrogate people.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.275
They'll do a fine job.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.277
They will either kill her,
or she'll escape.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.192
And we will lose our best
chance, the best chance

31:30.279 --> 31:32.194
we've had of getting
to Red John.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.501
Kill her? W-what? Why?

31:34.588 --> 31:37.547
The-the FBI?
D-don't be ridiculous.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.723
Red John has a friend..

31:39.810 --> 31:41.247
...high up in the FBI.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.684
Oh, please.
Now, how do you know that?

31:43.771 --> 31:46.078
- He told me.
- Oh, well, there you go.

31:46.165 --> 31:49.298
If we don't get her, I will blow
this whole cover-up wide open.

31:49.385 --> 31:52.171
The truth of Wainwright's death,
all over the news.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.738
But if you do that,
this whole deal collapses.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.437
- And you go to jail.
- I don't care.

31:57.524 --> 32:00.657
You call a hearing, or I will be
very glad to sing like a bird.

32:10.189 --> 32:12.713
[clears throat]

32:12.800 --> 32:14.802
Well, I've studied all
the documents in this matter

32:14.889 --> 32:16.804
'and it is very clear to me'

32:16.891 --> 32:19.154
that all of you people
are lying through your teeth.

32:19.241 --> 32:21.504
- Judge--
- No, I don't wanna know.

32:21.591 --> 32:26.118
Whatever sordid errors you're
all conspiring to cover up

32:26.205 --> 32:28.120
I don't wanna know.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.774
The sole purpose of this meeting
is to decide

32:30.861 --> 32:34.648
'who is best equipped to have
custody of Lorelei Martins.'

32:34.735 --> 32:36.998
I will decide in favor
of whichever side

32:37.085 --> 32:39.348
irritates me the least.

32:39.435 --> 32:43.874
I will tolerate no misbehavior
of any kind.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.789
Proceed with care.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.444
Your Honor,
I would ask you

32:48.531 --> 32:50.881
to simply to look at the record
of Patrick Jane.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.275
'Red John killed his family.'

32:53.362 --> 32:55.669
'Lorelei Martins is a close
confederate of Red John.'

32:55.756 --> 32:58.846
How can this man possibly
treat her with the clarity

32:58.933 --> 33:00.674
'and the objectivity required?'

33:00.761 --> 33:04.721
He's not a trained professional.
He's a vigilante.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.767
And that alone
should disqualify the CBI

33:06.854 --> 33:08.769
'from custody at this matter.'

33:08.856 --> 33:12.468
For many years,
I have been pursuing Red John.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.950
I know this case better
than anybody else.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.300
These people, they don't know
how to make

33:18.387 --> 33:20.737
Lorelei Martins talk,
and I do.

33:20.824 --> 33:24.480
If I may interject,
Miss Martins tells us

33:24.567 --> 33:28.354
that she has had sexual
relations with Mr. Jane.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.573
That may be the source
of his confidence.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.314
Is that so?

33:32.401 --> 33:34.229
Yes, it is.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.926
We have a relationship.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.667
'Uh, that's a good thing.'

33:37.754 --> 33:39.365
That's how you turn people.

33:39.452 --> 33:42.020
I had expected a denial,
to be honest.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.891
'Do we need to continue?'

33:43.978 --> 33:48.069
Um, that does tend
to disqualify you, Mr. Jane.

33:48.156 --> 33:50.724
So, um, if you have
nothing further--

33:50.811 --> 33:52.726
She's already given me
valuable information.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.075
Let's not stop me now.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.511
Valuable information like what?

33:57.296 --> 33:59.559
With all due respect, this
is not the time or the place

33:59.646 --> 34:01.169
to share the details.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.389
If you wanna see
Lorelei Martins again

34:03.476 --> 34:07.132
this is both the time
and the place.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.177
She told me
that all Red John's friends..

34:11.266 --> 34:14.139
...have a secret sign they use
to identify each other.

34:15.488 --> 34:16.619
And what is it?

34:17.794 --> 34:19.753
Go on.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.973
They carry a glass bead
in their pocket.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.281
Blood red,
the size of a pea.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.891
Lorelei showed me hers.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.111
That's it?
Unprovable trivia?

34:30.198 --> 34:32.940
- It proves she trusts me.
- It proves nothing.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.247
Can we stop this farce now?

34:35.334 --> 34:38.250
It is a bit thin, Mr. Jane.
Is that all you have?

34:38.337 --> 34:40.339
[Jane]
'No.'

34:40.426 --> 34:42.123
[chuckles]
Not at all.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.474
- Well?
- Red John has an accomplice.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.389
- Inside the FBI.
- Come on.

34:47.476 --> 34:49.652
[laughter]
Judge, this man is just
spinning fantasies now--

34:49.739 --> 34:52.525
Yes, yes, you would say that.
I saw you.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.483
And what do you mean by that?

34:54.570 --> 34:57.878
When I mentioned the glass bead,
you suddenly looked very guilty

34:57.965 --> 34:59.706
and you glanced at your
right-hand jacket pocket.

34:59.793 --> 35:00.881
What's in there, Mancini?

35:02.578 --> 35:04.711
This-this is the same thing
that you did to Norris.

35:04.798 --> 35:05.886
- 'What?'
- Son of a bitch--

35:05.973 --> 35:07.061
[Judge Manchester]
'Agent.'

35:07.148 --> 35:08.802
What's in your pocket, Mancini?

35:08.889 --> 35:10.195
There's nothing.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.197
This is a childish trick,
Your Honor.

35:12.284 --> 35:15.504
Th-this man has just planted
a bead on me.

35:15.591 --> 35:18.551
Uh, let's be clear.
I have not touched you.

35:18.638 --> 35:21.293
Everybody in this room
has seen that.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.512
But you're saying
that there is, in fact

35:23.599 --> 35:25.471
a red glass bead
in your pocket.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.560
- Is that what you're saying?
- No.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.257
You're putting words
in my mouth.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.738
Show us what's
in your pockets, agent.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.218
- 'You don't understand--'
- Show us.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.965
[Mancini]
'He planted it.'

35:42.052 --> 35:43.663
He planted it.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.578
But he didn't touch you,
did he?

35:48.276 --> 35:50.670
You son of a bitch.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.498
- 'Mancini.'
- 'Order.'

35:52.585 --> 35:55.457
- Get over here.
- 'Order.'

35:55.544 --> 35:58.286
[Judge Manchester]
'Agent Schultz,
this is a disgrace.'

36:02.290 --> 36:03.770
- Huh!
- Ah, well done.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.598
Good job.
When do we get her back?

36:05.685 --> 36:07.948
Uh, judge says we can pick her
up at county jail tomorrow.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.429
Did, uh, Mancini really
throw a bottle at you?

36:10.516 --> 36:13.388
Yes, he did, and then
he proceeded to chase me

36:13.475 --> 36:17.175
through the state house,
but failed to catch me.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.481
Congratulations.
Another mortal enemy made.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.048
You should be very proud.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.876
'Uh, meanwhile,
we've got a case to solve.'

36:22.963 --> 36:25.270
Well, let's get busy
then, boss.

36:25.357 --> 36:27.228
[sighs]
So let's just a-assume

36:27.315 --> 36:29.665
that Rex was at Callie's
apartment to fix her computer.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.319
What happened next?

36:31.406 --> 36:32.929
How does that escalate
to a double murder?

36:33.016 --> 36:34.670
Well, maybe the computer
is the key.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.324
Maybe there was something
important on the hard drive.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.718
And she cleans hotel rooms.
What could be important?

36:38.805 --> 36:41.286
How does that connect
to her lipstick on his cheek?

36:41.373 --> 36:43.897
He couldn't fix her computer,
so they made out instead?

36:43.984 --> 36:47.030
Well, there are other reasons
for kissing someone.

36:47.117 --> 36:49.642
Celebration, for instance,
hence the champagne.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.730
What would they be
celebrating?

36:50.817 --> 36:52.210
Well, maybe the kiss was..

36:52.297 --> 36:53.689
"...Thanks for trying
to fix my computer."

36:53.776 --> 36:56.083
So who's the third person here?
What are we missing?

36:56.170 --> 36:57.824
[sighs]
Sorry, I'm late.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.869
They're setting up a stage
for the state lottery prize

36:59.956 --> 37:02.785
presentation at the capital.
Traffic on L Street was crazy.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.700
[Rigsby]
'Oh, the lottery,
they should do that'

37:04.787 --> 37:07.137
at Raley Field, or someplace
where they have parking.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.748
Uh, when did
computer forensics say

37:08.835 --> 37:10.358
they'd be done
with Callie's hard drive?

37:10.445 --> 37:11.925
- 'End of the week, but--'
- Ah!

37:12.012 --> 37:13.622
- What?
- Callie's sister, Nicola.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.145
You have a phone number?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.017
[instrumental music]

37:18.845 --> 37:21.239
[male #1]
'Ladies and gentlemen,
friends'

37:21.326 --> 37:24.720
it is my very great pleasure
to introduce to you at this time

37:24.807 --> 37:28.637
the lucky winner of this year's
biggest lottery jackpot.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.900
Please welcome to the stage
a young woman

37:30.987 --> 37:35.427
who is now worth $56 million

37:35.514 --> 37:37.080
'Valerie Whittaker.'

37:37.167 --> 37:38.386
'Come on out here, Valerie.'

37:38.473 --> 37:39.779
[crowd applauding]

37:39.866 --> 37:41.607
- 'There you go, Valerie.'
- 'Wow.'

37:41.694 --> 37:44.218
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

37:44.305 --> 37:46.786
Thank you so, so, so much.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.310
I'm so blessed.
Thank you.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.703
Valerie, how you feeling?

37:50.790 --> 37:52.879
[laughs]
Oh, I'm just in shock.

37:52.966 --> 37:53.967
It's like a movie.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.447
Any plans for the money?

37:55.534 --> 37:57.840
- Not yet.
- I'm gonna take a flier.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.364
Do you happen to know
a Tom Yannick

37:59.451 --> 38:00.756
of the Sacramento police?

38:02.410 --> 38:03.977
- No.
- Are you sure?

38:04.064 --> 38:05.544
''Cause I'm pretty sure.'

38:05.631 --> 38:06.936
'Who else would have had
the opportunity?'

38:07.023 --> 38:09.287
A random intruder?
Unlikely.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.810
Tom Yannick.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.420
Is he not your boyfriend then?

38:12.507 --> 38:13.813
- Huh-uh.
- Okay, just a moment.

38:15.249 --> 38:17.643
Valerie, this is Nicola Karlsen.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.123
She's Callie Karlsen's sister

38:20.210 --> 38:22.691
the woman that was brutally
murdered for the lottery ticket

38:22.778 --> 38:24.302
that won that check
you're holding there.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.216
'Would you tell her
you don't know Tom Yannick?'

38:29.089 --> 38:30.177
Aha!

38:33.006 --> 38:34.355
You told me
nothing would go wrong--

38:34.442 --> 38:36.357
- Shh! No, stop, stop!
- Thomas Yannick..

38:36.444 --> 38:37.532
...you're under arrest
for murder.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.447
[crowd muttering]

38:39.534 --> 38:42.320
Yes, this doesn't belong to you.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.846
We're gonna have to get
the name changed.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.239
Do you have a...marker?
Pen?

38:50.632 --> 38:52.373
Callie was checking
the lottery numbers

38:52.460 --> 38:55.115
while Rex tried to fix
her computer.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.986
She won $56 million.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.294
[screaming]

39:00.381 --> 39:01.861
[Rigsby]
She kissed Rex.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.776
Got the champagne
out of the fridge.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.344
And she called her sister.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.042
Then greed
got the better of Rex.

39:09.129 --> 39:12.872
And he tried to strangle Callie
so he could steal the ticket.

39:12.959 --> 39:14.526
But she killed him instead
with the champagne bottle

39:14.613 --> 39:16.310
and called 911.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.965
And half-strangled
and in shock, she fainted.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.882
And that's where you come in.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.101
You found the two of them,
you saw the lottery ticket

39:25.188 --> 39:27.800
and the champagne bottle
You put two and two together.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.236
Quite the detective.

39:29.323 --> 39:30.542
So you killed Callie.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.850
You think about it for a while,
or you just go for it?

39:37.418 --> 39:39.899
I-I thought about it
for a while.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.858
[sighs]
And I felt bad for her.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.947
But $56 million, man.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.993
Yeah.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.777
Well, you should have thought
about it a while longer.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.566
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.917
You're such a good man.
Mmm.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.179
[no audio]

39:59.266 --> 40:00.441
Thank you, hmm.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.619
Sorry to interrupt, Nicola

40:04.706 --> 40:06.055
but Jane and I
have to pick up a prisoner.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.407
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.020
[cell door buzzing]

40:17.980 --> 40:21.027
Come on!
What is taking so long?

40:21.114 --> 40:23.116
Relax. She'll be here.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.510
Look, I-I'm sorry,
by the way.

40:25.597 --> 40:28.817
For what? There's a long
list of possibilities.

40:28.904 --> 40:33.169
Yeah, well, this is more
of a general purpose apology.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.824
Use it for your top issue.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.130
Thanks.

40:39.175 --> 40:42.004
- 'There you go.'
- Who's this?

40:42.091 --> 40:44.442
- '5467B'.
- 'That's not her.'

40:44.529 --> 40:47.488
- There's been a mistake.
- There's no mistake.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.229
Her paperwork's all in order.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.926
It's the only
Lorelei Martins we got.

41:00.762 --> 41:03.025
[Jane]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

41:06.115 --> 41:07.813
