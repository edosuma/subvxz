00:25.025 --> 00:27.319
Theorizing that one could
time-travel

00:27.402 --> 00:28.612
within his own lifetime,

00:28.695 --> 00:32.115
Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into
the Quantum Leap Accelerator

00:32.198 --> 00:33.909
and vanished.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.458
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.708 --> 00:44.628
facing mirror images
that were not his own,

00:44.711 --> 00:46.964
and driven by
an unknown force

00:47.047 --> 00:49.466
to change history
for the better.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.344
His only guide on
this journey is Al,

00:52.427 --> 00:54.471
an observer from his own time,

00:54.555 --> 00:56.098
in the form of a hologram

00:56.181 --> 00:58.684
that only Sam
can see and hear.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.938
And so Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.063 --> 01:05.983
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.902
and hoping each time
that his next leap

01:09.486 --> 01:11.405
will be the leap home.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.458
Well?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.586
Well, can I?

01:25.669 --> 01:26.753
Can you, what?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.547
Kiss her.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.468
Go.

01:44.813 --> 01:45.939
Oh, boy.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.360
Leaping into
other people's lives

03:13.443 --> 03:15.320
can be an incredibly
emotional experience.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.574
In fact, sometimes it can be
downright spiritual.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.579
Ladies.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.956
You call that
a religious ceremony?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.040
Uh, uh...

03:27.541 --> 03:29.001
Well, I, uh...

03:29.126 --> 03:32.337
We been to 27 wedding
in this church.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.339
Twice that many funerals.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.674
Is that right?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.302
Don't worry,
I seen worse.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.930
The first time is
always the hardest.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.140
The first time is...

03:43.223 --> 03:45.559
We hardly
noticed the shaky legs.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.060
Or your heavy breathing.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.228
And the sweaty palms.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.355
Or the crack
in your voice.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.107
Anything else?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.735
You forgot to
introduce the newlyweds.

03:54.818 --> 03:58.614
A... a good priest always
introduces the newlyweds.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.950
Well, I... I just figured that
everybody knew 'em and...

04:02.159 --> 04:03.619
Or maybe not.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.163
Ladies.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.289
Uh, Padre.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.291
It was a lovely service,
wasn't it?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.334
Hmm.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.920
Father Pistano did heck of
a job, don't you think?

04:13.003 --> 04:16.005
Uh, Frank, could I see you
for a minute in my office?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.089
Frank?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.843
Frank. Yes, yes... yes, sure,
I'll see you.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.261
Ladies.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.098
Well, ladies, uh,
it was nice meeting you.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.683
Meet us?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.519
We come to Mass
everyday.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.647
I mean meeting you again.

04:31.688 --> 04:35.651
It was very nice to
meet you both again.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.035
No, no, no, I don't like
the looks of that one.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.330
Lost, hopelessly lost. Hmm!

04:48.956 --> 04:50.457
Momma...

04:53.627 --> 04:56.421
Looks like you experienced
two milestones today.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.048
Your first wedding,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.509
and your first encounter
with the Montocelli sisters.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.428
I hope they didn't
rough you up too much.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.182
Well, I guess I let my nerves
show a little, uh...

05:08.392 --> 05:09.434
Thanks for saving me.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.435
Forget it.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.605
I was here 10 years before
they quit reviewing my sermons.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.900
Now they just shoot me dirty
looks from the front row.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.735
At least you're Italian.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.737
They consider being
Irish a birth defect.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.031
You want some of this?
It'll help your nerves.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.783
No, thanks. I'm, uh...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.327
I'm... I'm fine now.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.037
Liquid courage.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.709
Tsk.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.462
I'm afraid I'm gonna need
all of that I can get today.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.800
I baptized that boy, Frank.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.387
And I watched him grow up.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.224
Now I gotta bury him.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.352
12 years old.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.152
I don't know.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.362
I guess I should've
seen it coming.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.740
It was...
it was an accident.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.200
How... how could you
see it coming?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.410
Oh, come on, Frank, we both
know it wasn't an accident.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.580
The kid's been walkin'
those tracks all his life.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.749
He didn't fall
in front of that train.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.459
Well, you know,

06:17.127 --> 06:18.795
accidents, uh...

06:19.296 --> 06:21.632
This kind of thing
is hard to accept,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.593
especially when it happens
to someone so young.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.261
Did you learn that
in the seminary?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.263
Uh, no.

06:30.641 --> 06:31.725
Yes.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.104
I mean, well,
yes... yes, uh...

06:39.233 --> 06:41.193
It just helps you

06:42.069 --> 06:44.071
kind of make
sense out of things.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.782
I don't know what
makes sense anymore.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.287
Blessed be the Lord God,

06:52.996 --> 06:56.083
for he hath visited
and redeemed his children.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.628
To bring light to
those who sit in darkness,

07:00.003 --> 07:01.380
and in the shadow of death.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.298
I... I don't know why
we had to come here.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.967
Just keep your eyes open.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.510
You don't need that thing.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.136
I'm not taking it
'cause I need it,

07:08.220 --> 07:09.513
I'm taking it
'cause I want it.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.223
Pop's buried here
somewhere, isn't he?

07:11.306 --> 07:12.850
How the hell
should I know?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.101
We should go see him.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.186
Seeing him won't change
nothin', Joey. He's dead.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.312
You ever think about him?

07:17.396 --> 07:19.398
You ever stop
asking questions?

07:19.481 --> 07:21.650
Come here
and give me a hand.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.780
Ready? Go.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.538
You know, you gotta stop worryin'
about other people so much.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.831
It's every man
for himself,

07:35.873 --> 07:37.249
and the sooner
you realize that,

07:37.332 --> 07:39.334
the better off
you'll be.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.586
Come on.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.462
We... we don't have
to do this, Tony.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.339
You don't wanna
be rude, do you?

07:44.423 --> 07:46.508
Let's go.
We're gonna be late.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.346
I still think
we should go see Pop.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.520
...to lead his children
into the kingdom of heaven

07:58.562 --> 08:01.190
to guide his feet
on the path of peace.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.401
That he would
grant that we be...

08:18.248 --> 08:20.292
That he would grant that

08:20.626 --> 08:23.504
we be delivered out of
the hands of our enemies,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.923
so that we might serve him

08:27.174 --> 08:30.511
without fear,
all the days of our life.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.011
Amen.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.393
We all loved Sonny.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.481
He was the best
part of what we are.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.567
He was a loving son,

08:47.819 --> 08:49.863
and he was a dear friend.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.032
But above all,
he was a boy.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.869
He was a child who
loved unconditionally,

08:56.328 --> 08:58.413
who trusted without question.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.249
If we failed him,

09:01.291 --> 09:05.087
then we must live
with the hope of forgiveness.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.843
I will miss him
with all of my heart,

09:12.511 --> 09:15.597
and I will remember him
for the rest of my life.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.949
I, uh, just want to express
my sympathy, uh, to you

09:34.032 --> 09:36.493
on this tragic day,
Mrs. Dellisio.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.581
Murderer! Murderer!

09:40.664 --> 09:41.790
Don't. Don't.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.793
Don't make
a circus out of this.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.378
Let this woman
grieve for her son.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.422
Come on, Tony,
let's go.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.133
You said he was my paisan.
Why should I leave, huh?

09:51.175 --> 09:53.302
Because he's asking you to.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.017
I'll see you around,
huh, Father?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.696
My baby's gone.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.751
See you.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.882
You coming inside, Frank?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.383
No, I'm gonna, uh...

10:33.759 --> 10:36.929
I... I think I'll just stay out
here and get some air.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.308
It's a long way from where
you started, isn't it?

10:41.934 --> 10:43.936
Yeah, you could say that.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.813
Well, I know
it's hard to believe,

10:47.564 --> 10:50.067
but this job does
have some rewards.

10:50.901 --> 10:54.321
I didn't realize Nehru jackets
were in style in '63.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.240
That's a real long one.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.700
I saw you earlier.
Where did you go?

10:58.742 --> 11:01.954
Hey, you priests drive around
in limos all the time?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.374
Only when we have
to bury somebody.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.668
Oh.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.378
Who died?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.171
A kid.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.215
A 12-year-old kid.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.592
Sorry.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.054
What am I doing here?

11:21.890 --> 11:25.686
Uh, your name is
Francis Giuseppe Pistano.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.646
uh, everybody calls you Frank.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.648
You've been two years
out of the seminary,

11:29.731 --> 11:32.067
and St. Dorothy's here
is your first assignment.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.819
Now, prior to that...

11:33.902 --> 11:35.487
Would you just
get to the point?

11:35.571 --> 11:36.947
Is it to prevent a murder?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.323
Uh, yeah.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.410
How did you know that?

11:41.785 --> 11:44.413
I think the kid that Father
Mac buried today was murdered.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.749
So, if I'm here to stop that,
I'm a little late.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.379
No, it wasn't him, I...
I... it was this Father Mac.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.340
Ziggy says there's
an 86.2 percent chance

11:55.424 --> 11:59.261
that this Father Mac is gonna
be murdered in the next 36 hours.

12:08.604 --> 12:11.481
Why would anyone want
to kill a priest, Al?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.359
Well, in Pennsylvania in 1963,

12:14.443 --> 12:17.779
it was probably fear of death
by electrocution,

12:17.863 --> 12:20.073
or even hanging.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.618
See, a month ago,

12:22.659 --> 12:24.703
Father Mac was one of
two witnesses to a robbery,

12:24.786 --> 12:26.663
and a store clerk
got killed.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.707
This case goes
to trial in two days,

12:28.790 --> 12:31.502
and the killer,
one Tony Pronti...

12:31.585 --> 12:33.253
He was at the funeral.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.964
Oh, well, he... he
probably killed Father Mac

12:36.089 --> 12:37.549
to keep him
from testifying.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.801
What about the other witness?

12:40.511 --> 12:42.513
That's the kid
you buried.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.689
Look, do we know exactly when

12:52.731 --> 12:56.485
this Tony Pronti
tries to kill Father Mac?

12:57.528 --> 13:01.823
Well, uh, Ziggy's havin'
problems getting the details,

13:04.034 --> 13:07.204
but, uh, I'll get back to you
as soon as he gets 'em.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.491
It truly is a sanctuary,
isn't it?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.081
I'd forgotten how
beautiful it could be.

13:56.545 --> 13:59.214
Uh, you want to talk about
what happened today?

13:59.298 --> 14:01.717
No, but I get
the feeling you do.

14:02.593 --> 14:05.304
One thing you have to remember
about this business, Frank.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.681
Things are never as bad

14:07.764 --> 14:09.641
or as good as
they appear to be.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.571
You all right?

14:22.613 --> 14:23.614
Yeah.

14:45.636 --> 14:48.096
There's a lot of
disturbed people out there.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.599
We're talking about one
particular disturbed person.

14:50.641 --> 14:51.808
Tony Pronti.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.185
Well, he certainly
has a motive.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.270
You can see for yourself
that's been tampered with.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.105
Now why don't you go
out and arrest him?

14:57.147 --> 14:59.650
Can you make
a positive ID, Father?

15:00.984 --> 15:02.611
Well, no.
It was dark.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.905
Father, look,
there's nothing I'd enjoy more

15:04.988 --> 15:07.157
than gettin' that
nutcase off the streets.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.993
But unless you saw somebody,
there's not much I can do.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.286
Oh, come on.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.454
He's right, Frank.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.498
We don't have any
proof that it was Tony.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.208
I'll have Jackson
and Little cruise

15:16.291 --> 15:19.044
close to the church
until the trial's over.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.588
I'm sorry,
I can't do more.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.144
Listen, Mac, I know it's
not my place to say anything

15:36.186 --> 15:38.480
but don't you think that your
drinking is getting to be...

15:38.522 --> 15:40.899
You're right.
It's not your place.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.134
Are you sure you want to
get out around here?

16:07.217 --> 16:09.970
I mean, this ain't
exactly Vatican City.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.098
You sure this is
where Tony hangs out?

16:13.182 --> 16:14.600
This is the place.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.851
How much do I owe you?

16:15.934 --> 16:17.144
Forget it, Father.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.313
I feel guilty enough
just bringing you here.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.731
Okay. Thanks.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.608
You... you take
care of yourself.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.563
It's a little
bit late to be out

17:01.605 --> 17:03.607
spreadin' the good word,
isn't it, Father?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.442
I need to talk to you.

17:05.526 --> 17:08.779
I'm sorry, I can't hear
a word you're saying. What?

17:15.117 --> 17:16.453
Excuse me.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.752
Ooh, Padre.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.253
Can you hear me now?

17:25.337 --> 17:27.005
That was pretty rude,
wasn't it?

17:27.964 --> 17:29.925
Wait a second.
I know why you're here.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.552
I lost my head...

17:31.635 --> 17:34.137
You're here collecting for
the poor, aren't you, Father?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.556
Excuse me.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.558
Sweetheart,
you got anything

17:37.641 --> 17:40.185
you'd like to uh, give to,
the good Father here?

17:40.269 --> 17:41.311
Tony.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.521
No?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.732
Sorry,
she already gave today.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.776
A couple of times.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.948
Would you
excuse us, please?

17:53.448 --> 17:55.868
Hey, you got somethin' to say
to me, you better say it, okay?

17:55.951 --> 17:59.121
'Cause this ain't no church,
and I ain't no altar boy.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.915
Although I understand
there's an opening.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.542
You were at
the church tonight.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.711
Somethin' happen
at the church, Father?

18:05.794 --> 18:07.963
Father Mac
was almost killed.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.133
I always said churches
was dangerous places.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.801
I'm not gonna
let you kill him.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.511
Don't push me, Father.

18:14.595 --> 18:16.638
What, are you gonna
push him back, punk?

18:16.722 --> 18:20.392
Like you pushed that little 12-year-old
kid underneath the train, huh?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.645
Did you sneak up behind him and
push him, you little loud-mouth punk?

18:23.729 --> 18:25.731
That's the way
you'd do it.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.281
Come on!

18:34.364 --> 18:35.324
Kid, get out
of the way.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.851
How'd you know
where to find me?

19:02.935 --> 19:04.603
I saw you taking the cab.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.522
I had a funny feeling,
and I followed you.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.859
Frank, where'd you learn
to use your feet like that?

19:12.152 --> 19:14.988
Uh, well, uh,
old Chinese movies.

19:16.031 --> 19:17.991
Old Chinese movies?

19:20.869 --> 19:23.372
Well, you sure made
an impression on Joey.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.207
I think I made
a bigger one on Tony.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.167
Yes, you did that.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.294
That's a strange duo.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.421
I mean, how does
a little guy like Joey

19:31.505 --> 19:33.590
end up hanging out
with trash like Tony?

19:33.966 --> 19:35.926
They're brothers, Frank.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.054
After the father died...

19:39.179 --> 19:41.098
Well, the mother
started drinking.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.976
Last I heard,
she was out on the streets.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.062
Tony's the only family
the kid's got left.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.732
It's a shame.
Joey's a good kid.

19:50.941 --> 19:51.900
He's a good fighter, too.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.402
I'd hate to lose him.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.740
You know, maybe, you know, if
you can get him away from Tony,

19:58.866 --> 20:01.285
uh, you might
just have a chance.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.169
This is where
Sonny was killed.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.087
Right under this bridge.

20:12.671 --> 20:16.466
They called me that night to
come down and identify the body.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.179
What was left of it.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.390
It's ironic,

20:24.016 --> 20:25.893
somebody that small

20:27.060 --> 20:30.105
leaves such a big gap
inside you when they go.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.402
I gotta get a drink, Frank.

20:48.916 --> 20:51.001
I thought
you said one drink.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.547
A friend wouldn't
make me drink alone.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.800
This isn't gonna help.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.595
Well, it's not
gonna hurt much, either.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.285
It's the Purple Heart.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.497
Silver Star.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.749
You got a trunk
full of commendations.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.000
You want 'em,
take 'em.

21:32.084 --> 21:34.336
They're all yours.
Take them all, Frank.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.713
You're a war hero.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.384
This guy, here,
he was no hero,

21:42.094 --> 21:43.679
just... just a survivor.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.311
There's 431 men
in that picture, Frank.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.939
Out in the Pacific?

21:54.064 --> 21:55.732
Guadalcanal.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.695
And you were the chaplain.

22:00.779 --> 22:03.782
No, no,
I was just a gyrene.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.873
First Marine Division.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.463
The Battle of Bloody Ridge.

22:19.798 --> 22:23.260
The enemy ran suicide squads
at us all day long.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.137
All day.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.392
I don't know how many men
I killed that day.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.352
50, 100...

22:34.396 --> 22:36.565
I just can't
remember anymore.

22:36.607 --> 22:38.901
But I swore if I lived,

22:39.985 --> 22:42.446
I'd spend the rest of my life
making up for it.

22:42.613 --> 22:44.489
So you became a priest.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.916
It seemed like
a good start at the time.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.542
Now, I don't know.

22:55.626 --> 22:57.920
See, Frank,
when I look around,

22:58.045 --> 23:00.380
I... I don't see that
I've done anybody any good.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.757
We all, uh,

23:03.008 --> 23:04.760
wonder sometimes

23:05.427 --> 23:07.387
if we're doing
the right thing.

23:07.471 --> 23:10.098
And I guess all
you can do is just believe

23:10.140 --> 23:13.268
that you'll make
a difference in the long run.

23:13.310 --> 23:14.937
Do you think you will?

23:14.978 --> 23:16.772
Well, I wouldn't be
here if I didn't.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.815
I wish I could be so sure.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.904
Listen, uh,
you know, Mac,

23:24.279 --> 23:26.949
I think maybe
we should call it a day, huh?

23:27.991 --> 23:31.370
I was thinkin' that tomorrow

23:31.453 --> 23:33.080
maybe, you know,
if you wanted to,

23:33.163 --> 23:35.999
we could, well,
think about maybe...

24:39.271 --> 24:42.065
It's a little past
your bedtime, isn't it?

24:43.984 --> 24:46.695
Not if you don't know
where your bed is.

24:48.614 --> 24:49.615
Hmm.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.659
You got a point there.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.120
How's, uh, Father Mac?

24:55.204 --> 24:56.747
Oh, he's still alive.

24:57.915 --> 24:59.041
Physically, at least.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.667
I don't know
about his soul.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.546
I think he's losing his faith
as fast as his bottles.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.298
Yeah, that happens.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.884
It happens to priests
more than you'd think.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.388
What's goin' on, Al?

25:14.056 --> 25:15.766
I mean, ever since
we started this leap,

25:15.849 --> 25:17.893
you... you've been acting
like you hate being here.

25:17.976 --> 25:20.437
What, is something wrong with
Tina or the project? What?

25:20.479 --> 25:22.898
Tina's... She's fine.

25:23.774 --> 25:24.650
What?

25:24.733 --> 25:27.194
I think that collar
is goin' to your head.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.404
It doesn't have anything
to do with the collar.

25:29.446 --> 25:31.198
Would you at least
just talk to me?

25:31.281 --> 25:32.407
What... what is it,
this place?

25:32.491 --> 25:34.910
The... the... the church?
Is that it? What?

25:37.830 --> 25:39.373
You remember how
I told you about

25:39.456 --> 25:41.917
how my dad put my sister
and me in an orphanage

25:41.959 --> 25:43.752
because he couldn't
take care of us?

25:43.794 --> 25:45.128
Yeah.

25:45.504 --> 25:48.131
Well, I was 10 years old
when he came back.

25:48.215 --> 25:50.133
And he was all
excited about this money

25:50.175 --> 25:52.845
that he'd earned in the oil
fields in Saudi Arabia.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.430
He said it was going to
give us a great new start,

25:55.514 --> 25:58.308
and nothing could
ever separate us again.

25:58.642 --> 26:02.271
He even bought a house.
It was not a big one,

26:02.312 --> 26:05.440
but it was the greatest house
I remember seein'.

26:05.899 --> 26:06.900
Tsk.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.443
Well, then he got sick.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.779
He got sick,
and it got worse, and worse,

26:10.821 --> 26:12.781
and worse until
he had to go to the hospital,

26:12.823 --> 26:15.659
and it turns out
he had cancer.

26:17.119 --> 26:19.788
Well, I go to see him
and he says to me:

26:19.830 --> 26:23.834
"Don't worry, everything will be all
right so long as you pray for me. "

26:23.917 --> 26:25.127
So I did.

26:26.003 --> 26:29.590
Every day I went to church
and I prayed and I prayed

26:29.673 --> 26:34.595
and I prayed my heart out
until the day he died.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.602
I'm sorry.

26:44.146 --> 26:45.230
I... I forgot.

26:45.314 --> 26:46.607
Oh, you didn't forget.

26:47.316 --> 26:49.735
You didn't know.
I never told you.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.613
Al...

27:08.462 --> 27:09.838
Who's there?

27:22.392 --> 27:23.936
What are you doing here?

27:24.061 --> 27:25.562
I wanted to talk to you.

27:25.646 --> 27:29.566
But I could wait outside until
you're finished talking to yourself.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.569
Father?

27:32.653 --> 27:33.695
What?

27:33.737 --> 27:35.864
You think
you could put me down?

27:46.416 --> 27:49.419
Just let me, uh,
turn on a light, here.

27:58.095 --> 28:00.222
This is your room,
isn't it?

28:01.723 --> 28:03.392
Of course it is.

28:13.944 --> 28:15.445
Got a light?

28:18.365 --> 28:21.076
Aren't you a little
young to be smoking?

28:24.121 --> 28:27.583
Besides, I don't think you came
over here in the middle of the night

28:27.666 --> 28:30.335
to, uh, ask me
for a match, did you?

28:37.134 --> 28:39.052
I want you to
talk to Father Mac.

28:39.136 --> 28:40.637
Tell him
not to rat on Tony.

28:40.721 --> 28:42.431
Telling the truth
isn't ratting.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.391
If he takes the stand,
Tony's gonna hang.

28:44.474 --> 28:46.310
Your brother's young.
If he confesses,

28:46.393 --> 28:48.478
he's got a good chance of
beating the death penalty.

28:48.562 --> 28:50.147
But if it goes to trial,

28:51.356 --> 28:53.150
and the jury
finds him guilty...

28:53.233 --> 28:56.528
He ain't guilty of nothin'
but tryin' to stay alive.

28:56.987 --> 28:58.739
Is that what Tony
told you to say?

28:58.822 --> 29:00.199
Are you kiddin'?

29:00.282 --> 29:03.327
He'd kill me if he knew
I was talkin' to you.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.995
You won't tell him,
will you?

29:05.078 --> 29:07.289
I mean, priests
can't tell things, right?

29:07.789 --> 29:08.832
That's right.

29:08.916 --> 29:09.875
Good.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.921
He's, uh, trying to stop Father Mac
from testifying, though, isn't he?

29:14.004 --> 29:15.005
I don't know.

29:15.172 --> 29:16.215
I think you do.

29:16.340 --> 29:20.677
Look, I just want things to be
like they used to be, before.

29:20.844 --> 29:22.012
Before what?

29:22.179 --> 29:23.472
You don't understand.

29:23.514 --> 29:25.599
Tony wasn't
always like he is now.

29:25.682 --> 29:27.392
We used to do things.

29:27.476 --> 29:30.437
We used to go see
the Phillies at Shibe Park.

29:30.521 --> 29:33.357
Pop worked there selling
hot dogs on the weekend.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.192
Tony loved baseball.

29:38.529 --> 29:39.988
Then Pop died.

29:41.323 --> 29:42.866
We never went back.

29:44.159 --> 29:45.285
He got mean.

29:45.369 --> 29:47.788
Like he was mad
at the whole world.

29:50.374 --> 29:52.459
I shouldn't have come here.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.840
Tell Father Mac I'm
sorry about Sonny.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.925
Why don't you tell him?

30:04.555 --> 30:06.223
I've already
done enough, Father.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.058
I really gotta go.

30:22.781 --> 30:25.450
No, no, no, don't shut them.

30:25.534 --> 30:28.453
Keep them open.
Bret, Bret, look at me.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.957
How do you expect to hit
somebody you can't see?

30:32.082 --> 30:34.126
Now, you gotta keep
your eyes open, okay?

30:34.209 --> 30:36.211
Now, stick and move.
Stick! Now, stick!

30:36.295 --> 30:40.048
Good! Now here. Now, move...
move... move around. That's it!

30:40.132 --> 30:42.926
Stick! Stick! And move.
Another one! That's it.

30:43.010 --> 30:45.095
Keep it going!
Now shoot one. Good!

30:45.179 --> 30:46.805
Another one.
Another one. Stick it!

30:46.889 --> 30:48.348
Stinger, sting!

30:48.432 --> 30:50.017
That's it. Good goin'.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.727
That's the way
to do it, Bret.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.647
Okay, guys, now you gotta remember
to keep movin', keep movin'.

30:55.731 --> 30:59.151
Somebody's gonna knock your
head off if you don't. Okay?

30:59.610 --> 31:01.236
Nice going, Bret.

31:01.278 --> 31:02.362
Hmm.

31:02.571 --> 31:05.032
That sounds like
good advice to me.

31:06.450 --> 31:09.286
Yeah, well, if I could
just get him to take it.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.246
Maybe get him to leave town,

31:11.330 --> 31:13.790
until the trial starts,
anyway.

31:13.832 --> 31:16.210
Do you have any idea
when Tony tries to kill him?

31:16.293 --> 31:20.589
No. Ziggy's, uh, having
problems getting the details.

31:21.089 --> 31:24.259
He'll have it straightened
out in a couple of hours.

31:24.343 --> 31:26.512
What if we don't
have a couple of hours?

31:26.595 --> 31:29.306
How come sometimes he knows stuff,
and other times, he, you know...

31:29.389 --> 31:31.391
I don't know.
Want to ask him?

31:33.477 --> 31:34.770
All right,
guys, one more time.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.104
What'd we learn today?

31:36.146 --> 31:37.689
Eyes open!
And?

31:37.773 --> 31:38.732
Hands up!

31:38.815 --> 31:40.943
And keep movin',
or you're gonna get your...

31:40.984 --> 31:42.152
Heads knocked off!

31:42.236 --> 31:44.238
Nice workout, guys.
Go on, get out of here.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.489
Listen, drink a lot of water.

31:45.572 --> 31:47.282
I don't want anybody
gettin' dehydrated.

31:47.366 --> 31:49.618
Listen, Father, I won't be
able to make it this afternoon.

31:49.701 --> 31:51.453
You need a lot of work
on that heavy bag.

31:51.495 --> 31:54.289
I'd like to but I gotta work
part-time over at Fazio's butcher shop.

31:54.373 --> 31:55.499
We sort of
need the money.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.626
Okay, I understand.
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

31:58.293 --> 32:01.922
You know, uh,
I saw this movie once

32:02.005 --> 32:04.383
where this guy used
the beef hanging up

32:04.466 --> 32:06.635
in a meat freezer
as a punching bag.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.262
You might give it a try.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.305
Beef? Yo.

32:10.764 --> 32:12.057
Yo.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.645
Frank, I'm glad you came down.

32:16.687 --> 32:17.980
Come on,
let's go a few rounds.

32:18.063 --> 32:20.107
Break the sweat.
Do you some good, huh?

32:21.859 --> 32:25.445
Me? No. I mean, no... no.
I... I don't...

32:26.071 --> 32:27.739
I don't think so.

32:29.074 --> 32:30.701
Uh, listen, Mac...

32:30.784 --> 32:33.620
Is this going to be another one
of those Father Frank sermons?

32:33.704 --> 32:34.746
I'm afraid so.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.666
Well, listen, If you're gonna preach
to me, come on, get in the ring.

32:37.749 --> 32:39.710
Let's go a few rounds, huh?
Come on.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.837
Oh, what the heck, huh?

32:42.045 --> 32:45.674
It's not like we're gonna hurt
each other or anything, right?

32:45.757 --> 32:47.634
You want to keep
your right hand up, Frank.

32:47.718 --> 32:50.012
You know, opponents, they'll
sneak up and sucker you, man,

32:50.095 --> 32:51.388
just lay it on you.

32:51.471 --> 32:54.683
That's kind of what I've been
wanting to talk to you about.

32:54.725 --> 32:58.687
I mean, it's been a long time since
you've had any time off, hasn't it?

32:58.896 --> 32:59.813
So?

32:59.897 --> 33:00.856
So.

33:00.939 --> 33:03.358
I was thinkin' maybe you
should take a couple of days.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.527
Yeah? What do you want
me to do, dry out?

33:05.611 --> 33:06.862
For starters.

33:06.945 --> 33:10.407
It might also keep you alive
until you have to testify.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.535
I'll tell you what,
Frank, okay?

33:13.619 --> 33:15.913
I'll stay away from that kid
until after the trial.

33:15.996 --> 33:19.041
I think it would just be
easier if you left town.

33:22.878 --> 33:24.922
You want me to run, Frank.
I can't run.

33:25.005 --> 33:26.340
Who said anything
about runnin'?

33:26.423 --> 33:29.843
Priests take vacations every
once in a while, don't they?

33:31.428 --> 33:34.556
I've never run from anything in my
life, Frank, and I fight my own fights.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.767
I do it my own way. Get up.

33:49.613 --> 33:52.115
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you wanted to die.

33:52.199 --> 33:55.619
Okay, Frank,
sermon's over.

33:57.329 --> 33:58.872
I gotta go
hear confession.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.624
I'll take it for you.

34:08.257 --> 34:10.217
You don't have to
do it this way, Tony.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.885
Yeah, what do you
know about it?

34:11.969 --> 34:13.512
You're not the one
that's gonna hang.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.681
We could take off.
Go to Canada.

34:15.764 --> 34:16.931
I heard
it's nice up there.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.725
Oh, you heard
it's nice up there.

34:18.809 --> 34:21.270
What, one of your good
friends has been there?

34:22.353 --> 34:24.313
There's only one
way to handle this.

34:24.398 --> 34:25.565
You're wrong, Tony.

34:25.649 --> 34:27.067
Yeah, what do you know?

34:27.150 --> 34:29.945
I know you wouldn't be
doin' this if Pop was here.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.572
You don't know nothin'.

34:31.655 --> 34:33.322
You didn't even
come to his funeral.

34:33.407 --> 34:35.826
Pop was a loser, and he never
cared for any of us, okay.

34:35.909 --> 34:36.909
He loved us.

34:36.994 --> 34:38.328
Then how come
he killed himself?

34:38.411 --> 34:39.996
That's a lie.
No, that's the truth,

34:40.080 --> 34:42.123
and you're old enough to
know it! You're a liar.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.792
Pop had a heart attack.
Mama told me!

34:43.876 --> 34:45.585
Yeah, she didn't
want you to know!

34:45.960 --> 34:47.920
I don't believe you.
Pop was a great man.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.172
He was a coward!

34:49.339 --> 34:50.465
I don't believe you!

34:50.549 --> 34:52.926
Yeah? He hanged himself!

34:53.010 --> 34:54.678
How do you know, huh?

34:56.847 --> 34:59.308
'Cause I was the one
who found him.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.862
Sam, why would you
want to volunteer

35:11.945 --> 35:13.155
to do his confessions
for him?

35:13.238 --> 35:14.990
I was angry.
I wanted him to sit there

35:15.032 --> 35:16.325
and think about
staying alive.

35:16.366 --> 35:17.951
Well, do you think
you can handle it?

35:18.035 --> 35:19.536
Well, I don't know.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.956
What choice do I have?

35:23.040 --> 35:27.878
Well, you know, confessions are
kind of a sacred kind of thing.

35:27.961 --> 35:29.213
Sacred?

35:30.005 --> 35:32.633
I thought you didn't
believe in this anymore.

35:32.716 --> 35:35.511
Uh, well, uh,
I... I... I sort of don't, uh,

35:35.552 --> 35:38.096
but old habits, you know,
they're hard to get rid of.

35:38.180 --> 35:40.015
Then why don't you come
and give me a hand?

35:40.057 --> 35:41.517
No, you can handle it.

35:41.558 --> 35:44.144
Just, uh,
forgive everybody.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.480
And don't talk too much.

35:46.647 --> 35:48.232
Forgive everybody,
and don't...

35:48.315 --> 35:49.858
Yeah, forgive
everybody everything.

35:49.942 --> 35:51.193
I heard you.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.664
Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned.

36:04.540 --> 36:07.084
It's been 10 years
since my last confession.

36:09.002 --> 36:11.421
Since then
I've killed two people.

36:13.841 --> 36:15.467
Make that three.

36:33.443 --> 36:35.571
He killed Father Pistano!

36:46.290 --> 36:48.792
Oh, God, don't do this.

36:51.670 --> 36:54.965
I swore I would never have
anything to do with you again,

36:55.048 --> 36:56.967
but you can't do this.

36:57.050 --> 37:00.137
He's done too much,
he's helped too many people.

37:00.679 --> 37:03.348
You can't take him like this.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.315
Frank! God, Frank.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.317
Where am I?

37:16.236 --> 37:17.446
Thanks.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.616
You'll be all right, Frank.
Now just lie still.

37:20.699 --> 37:22.034
Did anybody see
who did this?

37:22.159 --> 37:23.535
Who did this?

37:24.328 --> 37:26.455
Uh, it was Tony,
Tony Pronti.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.667
Stay with him
till the ambulance comes.

37:30.751 --> 37:33.545
What happened, Al?
I gotta stop him.

37:33.629 --> 37:34.713
Ziggy had it all wrong.

37:34.796 --> 37:36.965
You weren't here to stop
someone from killing Father Mac,

37:37.049 --> 37:39.092
you're here to stop
Father Mac from killing Tony!

37:39.176 --> 37:40.177
Killing Tony?

37:40.260 --> 37:42.179
Yeah.
He must be delirious.

37:42.262 --> 37:43.639
You gotta stop Father Mac.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.432
He's... he's gone
to find Tony.

37:45.516 --> 37:46.725
I gotta stop him.

37:46.808 --> 37:47.768
Yes.

37:47.851 --> 37:49.269
Al.
Al?

37:49.353 --> 37:51.605
Al... Albert,
he wants to talk to you.

37:51.688 --> 37:53.357
W- w-why does he
want to talk to me?

37:53.440 --> 37:55.317
What do I look like,
a mind reader?

37:55.692 --> 37:57.486
Ziggy says
you're just stunned.

37:57.569 --> 37:59.655
It's... it's nothing serious,
so get up.

37:59.696 --> 38:01.824
Get up, get up.
Try and get up. Come on.

38:03.450 --> 38:04.660
Attaboy! Get up!

38:04.743 --> 38:08.163
No, Father, you really mustn't
move till the ambulance gets here.

38:08.205 --> 38:10.123
That's it, Sam, get up.

38:11.375 --> 38:13.168
Uh, Al, what happened?

38:13.335 --> 38:15.170
Well, Tony thought
you were Father Mac.

38:15.212 --> 38:18.215
Uh, it looks like Pronti
was trying to kill you.

38:18.298 --> 38:19.341
Where is he?

38:19.508 --> 38:20.551
Where's who?

38:20.634 --> 38:21.885
He's talkin' to me!

38:21.969 --> 38:23.345
Father Mac, he...

38:23.428 --> 38:27.015
he's on his way to
the railroad tracks with Tony.

38:27.975 --> 38:30.477
Railroad tracks?
Why would he...

38:31.019 --> 38:32.855
Sam, he's got a gun.

38:51.748 --> 38:54.418
Look out! Look out!
Hey, watch yourself, huh?

38:55.002 --> 38:56.378
Oh, Father,
what happened?

38:56.461 --> 38:58.380
Watch out,
you're gonna get killed!

38:58.422 --> 38:59.506
Only a little accident...

38:59.590 --> 39:01.091
Listen, I... I need to
borrow your car.

39:01.175 --> 39:02.467
Oh, God, why?

39:02.551 --> 39:04.052
We're running
out of time, Sam!

39:04.136 --> 39:05.679
Look, I don't have
time to explain.

39:05.846 --> 39:07.431
Here, here.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.183
Bless you.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.560
All right, go, go, go!
Put the pedal to the metal!

39:17.774 --> 39:18.734
Oh, boy!

39:24.907 --> 39:25.908
This is stupid, man.

39:25.991 --> 39:27.534
You're never gonna
get away with it.

39:27.618 --> 39:28.827
You know that,
don't you?

39:28.911 --> 39:30.329
That's far enough.

39:31.914 --> 39:34.875
Remember this spot, punk?
Turn around.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.043
Turn around!

39:39.171 --> 39:40.422
What're you
gonna do now?

39:40.506 --> 39:41.757
It's confession time, kid.

39:41.924 --> 39:43.634
Get on your knees!

39:45.511 --> 39:46.845
Huh? Huh?

39:49.473 --> 39:50.432
Huh?

39:51.433 --> 39:53.268
Now, talk to me, kid.

39:53.727 --> 39:56.522
If you move,
I'll kill you right here.

39:56.897 --> 39:58.398
You got that, huh?

39:59.149 --> 40:00.734
Now, you talk to me, punk.

40:00.818 --> 40:02.778
Go on, punk,
tell me how it happened.

40:02.861 --> 40:04.488
Talk to me now.

40:05.823 --> 40:07.533
You're crazy, man.

40:08.492 --> 40:10.828
You're a priest!
You... you can't do this!

40:10.911 --> 40:12.830
I was a man first, kid.

40:19.127 --> 40:20.087
Sam!

40:24.925 --> 40:26.677
Around this way.
Go, go, go!

40:27.261 --> 40:29.638
All right, just tell me
what you want, and I'll do it!

40:29.680 --> 40:32.307
I want... I want you
to bring Sonny back.

40:34.935 --> 40:37.437
I want you
to bring back the clerk.

40:37.563 --> 40:39.147
I can't bring 'em back.

40:39.231 --> 40:41.149
I'm not God,
and neither are you, man!

40:45.362 --> 40:47.489
Then may he
forgive us both, son.

40:48.574 --> 40:49.575
Mac...

40:49.908 --> 40:52.327
No, don't do this.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.955
I'm not gonna
let him walk, Frank.

40:56.039 --> 40:58.292
We're runnin' out
of track here, Sam!

40:58.375 --> 41:01.044
He can't walk,
you're an eyewitness.

41:01.128 --> 41:03.505
I didn't see
the murder happen.

41:04.339 --> 41:06.091
Sonny was afraid.

41:07.759 --> 41:11.722
Yeah, he was afraid, so I said
I'd tell them that I saw it happen.

41:11.763 --> 41:13.473
I was gonna
tell them the truth

41:13.557 --> 41:15.726
right after he testified,
but I didn't see it.

41:16.351 --> 41:18.312
You never saw it happen?

41:25.694 --> 41:28.238
No, Mac.
We'll find another way.

41:29.531 --> 41:32.159
For God's sake,
let him off the track.

41:35.412 --> 41:37.414
Sam, get off
of the track!

41:38.457 --> 41:39.791
Frank, get off the track.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.293
He's scum,
he's not worth it!

41:41.376 --> 41:43.462
I'm not doin' it for him,
I'm doin' it for you.

41:43.545 --> 41:45.422
They'll never
convict him, Frank.

41:45.589 --> 41:47.508
Not without witnesses,
and there aren't any!

41:47.591 --> 41:49.259
They're all dead!

41:54.848 --> 41:57.100
I did it, all right?
I did it!

42:06.443 --> 42:07.569
Mac.

42:10.113 --> 42:11.406
Hi, Frank.

42:12.783 --> 42:14.451
You're up early.

42:14.952 --> 42:17.955
I thought I'd get in
a little work before Mass.

42:18.163 --> 42:19.164
You okay?

42:19.289 --> 42:20.332
A little shaky.

42:20.791 --> 42:23.418
I've been reachin'
for that crutch for 10 years.

42:23.585 --> 42:24.920
It's a little hard to stop.

42:25.045 --> 42:26.463
One day at a time.

42:26.630 --> 42:28.257
One day at a time.

42:31.343 --> 42:33.428
I'll have to remember that.

42:36.431 --> 42:39.601
Frank, the other night
on the track, I... I was wrong.

42:41.061 --> 42:43.355
If you hadn't
been there, I...

42:43.981 --> 42:46.692
Well, I... I'm pretty
sure I would have...

42:46.775 --> 42:47.818
I might have...

42:47.901 --> 42:48.944
Mac.

42:51.572 --> 42:54.783
You better hurry up.
You're gonna be late for Mass.

42:55.617 --> 42:56.869
Yeah.

42:59.997 --> 43:01.623
Thanks, Father.

43:09.631 --> 43:11.592
He's gonna be just fine, Sam.

43:11.675 --> 43:13.635
He's here for
the next 20 years.

43:13.677 --> 43:15.804
Even had two
Golden Glove champs.

43:15.846 --> 43:17.431
What about Tony?

43:17.973 --> 43:19.975
Well, uh,
he doesn't hang.

43:20.100 --> 43:22.394
Did some serious time,
but when he got out,

43:22.519 --> 43:24.771
he... he made something
out of his life.

43:24.855 --> 43:25.939
Joey?

43:27.149 --> 43:29.318
I think
he's in good hands.

43:34.990 --> 43:36.950
You did a great job, Sam.

43:38.660 --> 43:39.995
Well, so did you.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.289
Yeah. Me, what?
Uh, what did I do?

43:42.372 --> 43:43.582
I didn't do anything.

43:43.665 --> 43:45.334
You prayed for me.

43:58.597 --> 44:00.015
Snowball.

44:00.724 --> 44:03.018
Snowball, good boy.

44:03.268 --> 44:05.979
Don't worry, Carl.
Lions never eat photographers.

44:06.063 --> 44:07.648
They give them
indigestion.

44:07.731 --> 44:11.568
Though I understand they nibble
at the slow ones now and again.

44:14.238 --> 44:15.447
Snowball.

44:19.535 --> 44:21.161
Oh, boy.

44:27.042 --> 44:31.213
