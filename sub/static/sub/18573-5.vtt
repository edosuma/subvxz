00:48.674 --> 00:49.716
Commodus.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.011
I don't know how things have gone so far.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.431
There have been mistakes.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.392
Unlucky breaks.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.812
But the idea
that I'm somehow behind all this...

01:03.814 --> 01:04.897
it's insane.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.819
These were freak accidents,

01:09.653 --> 01:10.821
one after the other.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.990
No one could have prevented them.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.202
The plague was a freak accident.
Without question, Emperor.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.829
But the grain shortage?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.164
Now that was a calculated act.

01:22.124 --> 01:25.252
You'd have me believe Cleander
wanted my people to starve?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.714
I'd never presume to know
the mind of any man,

01:29.590 --> 01:34.344
but I do know that this grain shortage
was no natural occurrence.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.892
How do you explain it, Cleander?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.060
Simply.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.897
Dio is trying to
overcomplicate the matter.

01:46.690 --> 01:50.485
There was a grain shortage.
We tried to resolve it.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.072
The plague prevented us from doing so.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.743
It's a catastrophe,
but that's all.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.829
A grain shortage.

02:02.122 --> 02:02.998
In Egypt.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.625
Where else?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.919
What was it? Drought? Blight?

02:08.252 --> 02:10.047
We've heard nothing on our end.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.801
The Senate will never understand

02:14.885 --> 02:16.929
the details that go into
running an empire.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.972
You're right, Cleander.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.016
But reports have made their way to me.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.603
And all of them say the grain shipments
have continued uninterrupted.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.064
Shipments are disrupted all the time.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.566
Marauders. Storms.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.109
You're right, Cleander.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.320
It happens constantly.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.199
But it's never been enough
to cause a shortage before.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.828
Commodus,

02:42.996 --> 02:46.208
what possible reason
could I have to see the people starve?

02:48.585 --> 02:49.878
There isn't one.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.966
That depends on
where the missing grain is.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.135
If it's at the bottom
of the ocean,

02:57.219 --> 03:00.097
or in the hold of a renegade ship,
then I would agree.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.642
And where else could it be?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.856
Commodus.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.068
If your people are starving,

03:13.986 --> 03:16.363
if their very lives are in danger,
the lives of their families,

03:16.446 --> 03:20.868
and then one man
swoops in to save them

03:20.951 --> 03:24.872
at the last minute with his own
personal grain supply,

03:27.666 --> 03:31.670
well, that man would be called a hero.

03:33.172 --> 03:37.926
With one act, that man would win
the people's undying love.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.721
Ambition knows no limits.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.724
You would speak of ambition?
 You, who--

03:43.807 --> 03:44.766
Enough.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.704
Who do you trust, brother?

04:07.414 --> 04:08.248
Dio?

04:09.541 --> 04:12.544
Or your brother,
who has stood beside you your whole life?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.684
Right now, I don't trust either of you.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.277
At the end of the second century,

04:37.736 --> 04:41.532
a shortage in grain
has devastated the Roman Empire.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.117
And with riots in the streets,

04:44.535 --> 04:49.665
the Emperor's closest advisor
and members of the Roman Senate

04:49.748 --> 04:53.043
now blame each other for the chaos.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.885
With no one he can trust,

06:25.677 --> 06:31.391
Commodus is forced to face the possibility
that he's been betrayed by his advisor.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.064
It doesn't make any sense.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.900
- Senator Dio is hiding--
- No.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.735
Cleander.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.988
Nothing he's saying makes any sense.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.327
I don't trust the Senator either.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.456
I don't trust what he's doing,
or why he's doing it,

06:55.123 --> 06:56.208
but...

06:59.461 --> 07:00.295
What?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.257
Speak.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.137
Even if he's doing it
for the wrong reasons,

07:10.138 --> 07:11.807
that doesn't mean it's not the truth.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.187
You're right.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.609
I want nothing more than to believe
what Cleander is telling me.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.612
But he's lying.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.031
What are you going to do?

07:46.884 --> 07:49.303
Responsible for
the Empire's grain supply,

07:50.304 --> 07:56.226
Cleander must now stand trial to determine
who's to blame for the shortage.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.866
Cleander, my entire city
is calling for your head.

08:13.869 --> 08:14.912
There have been oversights.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.788
-I've admitted that already.
-That's not enough.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.836
I've done all I can to relieve you
of the burdens of government.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.882
Perhaps I put too much on myself.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.344
But everything I've done,

08:32.179 --> 08:33.639
I've done for you.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.351
My loyalty cannot be questioned.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.812
With your permission, Emperor.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.817
I have someone, I believe,
who can speak to Cleander's loyalty.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.538
You and I both know Dio cannot be trusted.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.332
Remember the lands with the military?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.169
He's betrayed us before,
he's only trying--

09:13.303 --> 09:14.346
Tell him.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.850
I, uh...

09:18.809 --> 09:22.396
You understand, Emperor,
the awkward situation--

09:25.274 --> 09:26.942
You were my sister's servant.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.111
Yes, Emperor.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.032
I'm well aware of
Cleander's affection for you.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.955
What's Dio giving you?

09:40.497 --> 09:41.582
Nothing.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.504
You wouldn't be here if what you'd say
wasn't beneficial to him.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.550
But I can't see why you'd speak
against Cleander for Dio.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.887
It's not for Dio.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.141
It's for my mother. She died.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.685
Earlier this week. From the plague

10:02.728 --> 10:04.396
From Cleander's plague.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.235
You're only repeating
the word on the street.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.654
Emperor. He knew.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.200
He knew of the grain shortage, yes.

10:16.992 --> 10:18.243
He was working to stop it.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.330
No. Not the grain shortage.
He knew of the plot to kill you.

10:25.125 --> 10:29.004
I overheard Lucilla talking about it
with Senator Quintianus.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.050
Cleander pushed me
to find out more and I told him.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.846
I told him everything,
but he didn't just know.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.683
He helped them.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.522
He was angry, with you.
Saoterus. He killed--

10:46.605 --> 10:48.023
- He killed him.
- Oh, bitch!

10:48.106 --> 10:49.274
-He bragged about it before.
-You bitch!

10:49.358 --> 10:52.069
Dio must be paying her!
You lying bitch!

10:52.152 --> 10:54.696
You hear me?
You filthy whore. I'll kill you.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.365
I'll fucking kill you!

10:57.950 --> 11:00.118
Commodus. Commodus, she's lying.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.538
Dio must have gotten to her.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.207
I would never do such a thing.

11:05.791 --> 11:06.708
You know me.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.295
Dio must be paying her.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.342
Commodus.
You're my brother.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.343
I wouldn't--

11:41.577 --> 11:43.453
When Cleander is killed,

11:44.121 --> 11:46.665
it was very clear
that all the important elements

11:46.748 --> 11:48.792
of Roman society were against this guy.

11:51.461 --> 11:55.549
I mean now you had the people rising up,
the Senate hated this guy,

11:55.632 --> 11:57.259
He just had to go.

12:03.056 --> 12:07.144
The Roman Emperor
has been betrayed by his closest advisor,

12:07.227 --> 12:11.064
the one man he trusted,
to help him rule the Empire.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.944
And now, Commodus has no choice

12:16.653 --> 12:19.907
but to give the Roman people
what they want.

12:24.161 --> 12:29.499
With the people demanding justice,
Commodus hands over Cleander's body,

12:29.583 --> 12:34.838
and it's soon decapitated
and dragged through the streets.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.175
Rome is an extremely violent place.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.638
In the case of Cleander,
it's fairly clear that there was, in fact,

12:42.721 --> 12:44.723
a mob calling for his blood.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.226
There were people who were
literally out there,

12:47.309 --> 12:49.228
ready to tear him to pieces.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.574
Commodus has killed his closest friend,

13:03.992 --> 13:06.203
and to bring order to Rome,

13:07.579 --> 13:10.999
he looks to his only
remaining source of support.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.797
My apologies
for keeping you waiting, Emperor.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.132
I was not expecting visitors so late.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.639
My city's in chaos.
We must act.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.643
I couldn't agree more.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.565
The question is, what do we do?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.192
We go to war,

13:38.944 --> 13:41.196
expand our borders,
strengthen our glory,

13:41.864 --> 13:43.824
show the people what it means to be Roman.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.870
And with victory,
we'll prove the Gods are still behind us.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.623
Do I have your permission

13:51.707 --> 13:53.125
-to speak candidly?
-Of course.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.672
Wars take time, money, people.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.257
All things we are dearly lacking.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.218
Well, I won't just sit here
while my people riot.

14:03.302 --> 14:04.970
So tell me, Dio,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.431
what should I do?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.183
Grain? Land?

14:09.266 --> 14:11.810
Well, those things
have worked for you before, but...

14:13.061 --> 14:14.688
we have never faced
anything like this.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.356
Well, then what, Dio?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.237
I'm afraid there is no clean answer.

14:22.321 --> 14:24.907
There is no one action
you can take to correct this.

14:24.990 --> 14:25.949
Commodus...

14:27.868 --> 14:30.704
The Empire works best with balance.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.123
The Emperor provides strength
for the people, yes,

14:33.207 --> 14:35.584
but the Senate must filter that strength.

14:36.627 --> 14:40.088
Our job is to act as a shield
 between you and the people.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.175
Otherwise, there is just
a single man at the top,

14:43.258 --> 14:45.677
one person they can blame
for all their problems.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.305
And we've seen the danger in that.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.726
-So this is my fault, then?
-No, Commo-- No, Commodus.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.689
We must all share the blame for this.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.614
We failed in our duty to prepare you.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.617
I see that now.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.371
So what would you have me do?

15:14.998 --> 15:16.834
Let us help you.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.631
Trust us to help you.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.678
Trust you?

15:43.402 --> 15:47.906
While many people may
accuse Commodus of having been paranoid,

15:47.990 --> 15:51.702
if you've been raised
with this power from birth,

15:51.785 --> 15:55.622
there had to have been a legitimate
concern on the part of Commodus

15:55.706 --> 15:58.417
that there is something to be feared.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.922
It is not paranoia
 if people are actually trying to get you.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.937
As conditions in Rome continue to decline,

16:19.730 --> 16:24.526
Commodus begins to realize
that he has no one left to turn to.

16:33.535 --> 16:38.207
And just when it seems the state of
the Empire can't get any worse,

16:38.290 --> 16:42.252
catastrophe strikes in the heart of Rome.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.348
Triggered by a passing storm,

16:55.015 --> 16:58.310
a massive fire erupts
in the center of the city,

17:00.562 --> 17:03.232
causing widespread destruction and panic.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.205
The fire was started by a lightning strike

17:19.289 --> 17:21.333
within the city itself,

17:21.415 --> 17:24.795
leading immediately to rumors
of divine wrath and retribution.

17:27.506 --> 17:30.300
The Gods themselves were
angry with Commodus,

17:30.384 --> 17:31.760
were angry with the city of Rome,

17:31.844 --> 17:35.347
and were therefore going to gut it
 and going to destroy it.

17:38.892 --> 17:43.647
In just days, the fire destroys
ancient government buildings

17:43.730 --> 17:45.983
and religious shrines,

17:46.066 --> 17:49.069
devastating the Roman people,

17:51.655 --> 17:53.198
and their Emperor.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.758
Commodus was affected by many of these

18:11.842 --> 18:16.054
traumatic experiences
in the various stages of his reign.

18:16.555 --> 18:20.350
He faced all of these
other plots, plagues, fires,

18:20.434 --> 18:22.811
and these forms of disasters,

18:22.895 --> 18:26.064
and it's not surprising,
having faced all of these plots,

18:26.148 --> 18:30.319
that he did not necessarily
 trust the old system anymore.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.785
With the city in ruins,

18:39.494 --> 18:43.207
Commodus realizes
he has no one to turn to for help

18:44.374 --> 18:50.839
and begins to believe that
he's the only person who can save Rome.

19:07.105 --> 19:12.528
With a plan to gain control of his Empire
and restore glory to Rome,

19:14.947 --> 19:17.824
Commodus calls a meeting
with the Senate.

19:22.538 --> 19:24.456
To start this formal session,

19:24.790 --> 19:29.169
I have the honor of introducing
 Emperor Commodus.

19:35.384 --> 19:37.261
I've heard talk of omens,

19:39.054 --> 19:41.473
of dissatisfaction amongst the Gods.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.769
Our great city
has been devastated

19:46.645 --> 19:50.524
with famine, plague, fire.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.069
Streets have been destroyed,

19:54.778 --> 19:57.781
temples burned to the ground.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.118
Lives have been lost.

20:06.707 --> 20:10.836
But I'm here to tell you
this is not a bad thing.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.265
In a forest,
fire is far from a catastrophe.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.767
It's a necessity.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.104
It burns out the dead wood,

20:30.564 --> 20:33.525
allowing new growth, new life.

20:33.901 --> 20:38.155
Senators, we stand at the dawn
 of Rome's rebirth.

20:38.739 --> 20:42.993
A new age is upon us,
and we must embrace it.

20:45.913 --> 20:47.497
To celebrate this new age,

20:48.957 --> 20:50.501
and the coming of the new year,

20:51.752 --> 20:56.006
I'm announcing 14 days of Plebeian games.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.514
They'll be the greatest games
 that Rome has ever seen.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.893
An excellent idea, Emperor.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.440
I'm sure I speak for all the Senate

21:13.524 --> 21:17.528
when I say I cannot wait
to watch these games by your side.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.867
No, Dio.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.746
My place will not be in the Imperial box,

21:28.413 --> 21:30.040
but on the battleground.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.168
The greatest games in our history

21:33.877 --> 21:36.004
will have its greatest gladiator as well,

21:36.672 --> 21:38.382
the Emperor himself.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.221
Emperor,

21:44.930 --> 21:47.182
gladiators are slaves.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.309
The Emperor cannot be--

21:54.815 --> 21:57.860
I'm not asking for
your permission, Dio.

21:59.945 --> 22:02.614
The Senate will be in attendance.

22:03.156 --> 22:08.745
You and all of Rome
 will bear witness to my triumph.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.263
This fool will destroy Rome.

22:28.182 --> 22:30.058
If he survives.

22:51.997 --> 22:56.502
To restore his city
and regain the faith of the Roman people,

22:57.336 --> 23:03.133
Commodus will put on the biggest show
of games Rome has ever seen.

23:04.927 --> 23:09.181
And for the first time,
at the center of the arena,

23:09.264 --> 23:13.143
the Emperor will fight as a gladiator.

23:13.227 --> 23:14.144
All of a sudden,

23:14.228 --> 23:18.023
Commodus decides that he wants to be
involved in the governing of the city.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.859
All of a sudden, he wants to be there,
he wants to be known,

23:20.943 --> 23:23.612
he wants to be praised by the people.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.740
You might almost think of it
as an apology of sorts

23:26.823 --> 23:29.159
for those years
when he wanted nothing to do

23:29.243 --> 23:32.829
with being Emperor and now he does,
and now he's going to make it right,

23:32.913 --> 23:34.957
but he needs to prove himself first,

23:35.040 --> 23:37.709
and he does so by becoming a gladiator.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.339
For the people of Rome,

23:42.881 --> 23:48.971
no figure is more inspiring than the man
fighting to the death in the Coliseum.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.017
These gladiators allowed

23:54.101 --> 23:57.479
the Romans to indulge in a fantasy world

23:57.563 --> 23:59.982
that had a very close relationship

24:00.065 --> 24:06.238
to their views of themselves and
the values that they considered important.

24:07.906 --> 24:14.162
By staging 14 days of games
and starring as a gladiator,

24:14.246 --> 24:20.794
Commodus is certain that he can usher in
 a new era for the Roman Empire.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.131
Commodus, as an Emperor,
went one step beyond.

24:24.548 --> 24:27.759
Many emperors had given
expensive, lavish games.

24:27.843 --> 24:29.219
But up to this point,

24:29.303 --> 24:32.389
no one had ever fought as a gladiator.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.766
I mean,
it's one thing to give a show,

24:34.850 --> 24:37.811
it's another to give the show
 and also star in the show.

24:55.329 --> 24:57.873
Knowing the dangers of the Coliseum,

24:58.498 --> 25:02.085
Commodus enlists a slave
who will train him to fight,

25:05.714 --> 25:09.843
a skilled Roman gladiator
named Narcissus.

25:10.552 --> 25:13.472
Narcissus was an athlete, a wrestler,

25:13.555 --> 25:15.098
and Commodus looks to him

25:15.182 --> 25:18.435
to train him, because he wants to achieve
the kind of level of fitness

25:18.519 --> 25:21.230
that you need need to have
 to appear in the games.

25:22.064 --> 25:25.526
If he wants to pass himself off
as a gladiator,

25:25.609 --> 25:28.195
then he himself has to look the part.

25:28.278 --> 25:32.115
He has to look as fit
 as someone like Narcissus.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.581
With shows of strength and survival,

25:41.708 --> 25:47.589
Narcissus has made a name for himself
as an invincible Roman gladiator,

25:48.674 --> 25:53.971
and will now train the Emperor
to fight to the death in the arena.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.063
You summoned me, Emperor.

26:05.691 --> 26:07.526
You're going to train me, Narcissus.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.321
Every day.

26:12.573 --> 26:13.991
Starting now.

26:37.431 --> 26:38.765
Again.

26:43.729 --> 26:45.981
That's good, but don't stop
when you have the advantage.

26:46.064 --> 26:46.940
We'll reset.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.416
Down.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.919
Let me steady my feet.

27:13.592 --> 27:16.345
Look at me, not my blade.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.055
Come on, Emperor, push harder!

27:21.683 --> 27:22.851
Harder!

27:26.897 --> 27:27.773
Again.

27:30.734 --> 27:31.610
Come on!

27:41.245 --> 27:42.246
Enough.

27:44.081 --> 27:45.499
Enough for today.

28:14.194 --> 28:15.237
Not bad.

28:16.613 --> 28:17.990
Not bad.

28:21.994 --> 28:25.163
See this? This is simple.

28:26.415 --> 28:29.334
Out there, you stand before
your enemy face-to-face.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.879
There's no tricks.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.340
It's not simple.

28:37.718 --> 28:42.264
Maybe not simple, but it does
all come down to skill in the end.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.892
Skill plays a part.

28:47.144 --> 28:48.812
I saw you fight.
You were unbeatable.

28:50.397 --> 28:53.650
I'm a man, just like everyone.

28:55.944 --> 29:00.199
But you're right.
People thought I was unbeatable.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.413
You see, it's not enough just to be
better than your opponent.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.625
That leaves room
for Fortuna to play her hand.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.335
No.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.423
See, I won my battles
before I even entered the arena.

29:17.633 --> 29:19.635
Men came to me hopeless.

29:21.762 --> 29:23.555
How did you make the people
believe that?

29:25.307 --> 29:27.392
I gave them something
they'd never seen before.

29:29.686 --> 29:31.146
I was invincible.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.009
Eclectus.

30:02.386 --> 30:03.762
Emperor.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.932
Cancel the meetings.
I need to increase my training.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.016
As you wish.

30:11.728 --> 30:14.356
Commodus was all about image.

30:14.439 --> 30:15.524
He is someone who is

30:15.607 --> 30:19.945
eager to prove himself,
prove his masculinity.

30:22.614 --> 30:26.451
He wanted to be loved and adored.

30:26.535 --> 30:30.873
Commodus was very concerned
about the populace.

30:47.055 --> 30:50.767
As Commodus continues to train,

30:50.851 --> 30:55.272
members of the Senate
look to put an end to the Emperor's plan,

30:56.190 --> 30:59.484
including Cassius Dio.

31:03.864 --> 31:09.161
For years, Dio has watched the Emperor
violate centuries of tradition,

31:09.244 --> 31:12.080
and defy the authority of the Senate.

31:12.664 --> 31:18.712
But with the announcement of his games,
Dio believes the Emperor has gone too far,

31:20.088 --> 31:25.844
and knows there's only one person in
a position to change the Emperor's mind.

31:42.277 --> 31:43.862
Senator Dio is here to see you.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.906
Send him in.

31:51.119 --> 31:54.081
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all.

31:54.164 --> 31:55.832
Are you here to see the Emperor?

31:58.293 --> 31:59.670
No, no.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.172
I'm here to see you Marcia.

32:06.593 --> 32:08.554
Now, you and the Emperor, you've, uh...

32:09.721 --> 32:11.431
become quite close.

32:12.474 --> 32:13.976
I'd like to think so.

32:16.228 --> 32:18.230
Oh, I'm sure there's no one
 he feels closer to.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.731
There's no one he talks to more.

32:21.275 --> 32:24.194
I'm sure you've heard all about
his big announcement today.

32:24.278 --> 32:26.196
He plans to fight in the games.

32:28.657 --> 32:32.911
I'm afraid the Senate
is more upset than the Emperor realizes.

32:33.871 --> 32:37.165
I'm not sure Commodus cares
if the Senators are upset.

32:38.458 --> 32:39.918
And why would he?

32:40.002 --> 32:41.295
He's the Emperor after all,

32:41.378 --> 32:45.632
and we are but a bunch of old men
 rattling on about tradition and honor,

32:46.675 --> 32:49.595
but I've known Commodus
since he was a boy.

32:50.304 --> 32:52.264
I don't want to see him hurt,

32:53.807 --> 32:56.018
or even worse.

33:03.942 --> 33:05.235
Marcia...

33:08.238 --> 33:10.949
Commodus will be
entering the arena as a gladiator.

33:11.033 --> 33:14.661
He will fight to the death
against a trained killer.

33:17.539 --> 33:20.542
These are uncertain times.

33:26.715 --> 33:32.012
Now, please, forgive me
for interrupting your evening.

33:40.479 --> 33:42.648
Marcia, under the Emperor Commodus,

33:42.731 --> 33:48.278
does seem to have been able to almost rise
to the level of a significant advisor.

33:48.362 --> 33:53.116
She was trusted by Commodus,
and what is interesting with Marcia,

33:53.200 --> 33:57.162
is that even though she comes
 from a very low background,

33:57.246 --> 33:59.665
the sources suggest
that the amount of influence

33:59.748 --> 34:03.961
that she actually had over him
may have been very, very significant.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.737
It's natural to be worried.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.241
You doubt me?

34:34.324 --> 34:36.368
No, no.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.135
Emperor.

34:58.891 --> 34:59.892
What is it, Eclectus?

35:01.143 --> 35:02.519
Well, I can return.

35:03.812 --> 35:04.813
Just be quick.

35:09.735 --> 35:13.030
I have reports on the capture
of the exotic animals

35:13.113 --> 35:14.698
that you requested for the games.

35:22.581 --> 35:24.416
They were able to retrieve everything.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.752
Yes, but there appear to be complications

35:26.835 --> 35:29.213
in keeping the crocodiles alive
during transport.

35:30.297 --> 35:32.174
Have them collect twice
 what we need.

35:32.257 --> 35:33.759
Some are bound to survive.

35:33.842 --> 35:36.011
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

35:53.153 --> 35:54.905
What was that about?

35:56.323 --> 35:57.908
The Games.

36:32.484 --> 36:33.527
Emperor.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.197
No!

36:39.867 --> 36:42.119
It's time I learned what
it's really like in the arena.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.956
No more practice swords.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.460
Today we use live steel.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.046
Give me everything you have.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.552
Is this wise?

37:41.386 --> 37:42.804
I order you to fight me.

37:49.061 --> 37:51.522
If only the people
could see you now.

37:51.772 --> 37:52.856
Narcissus,

37:52.940 --> 37:55.025
the feeble gladiator!

37:55.442 --> 37:57.653
The weak, the ignoble,

37:57.736 --> 38:00.405
the disgraced, the dishonorable!

38:28.892 --> 38:30.143
It wasn't just about

38:30.227 --> 38:32.980
violence and machismo.

38:33.063 --> 38:34.648
It was also about skill

38:34.731 --> 38:37.067
and self-control.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.571
When a gladiator fell,

38:40.654 --> 38:45.993
he had to accept the death blow
 from his opponent with a calm expression.

38:48.912 --> 38:54.501
He had to stare calmly ahead
as the blade was plunged into his throat.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.748
Leave me.

40:32.182 --> 40:33.350
What's happened?

40:38.480 --> 40:41.733
-Are you sure you want to do--
-Leave me, please.

41:01.628 --> 41:06.008
After months of training
and preparation for his games,

41:06.091 --> 41:10.721
Commodus begins to realize
 he's not ready for the arena,

41:11.346 --> 41:14.099
and with the games quickly approaching,

41:14.183 --> 41:17.769
he starts devising a way
 to secure his victory.

41:35.162 --> 41:37.414
On the eve of the games,

41:41.251 --> 41:45.088
Commodus hosts an elaborate feast
for the gladiators,

41:45.172 --> 41:47.382
honoring Roman tradition.

41:48.091 --> 41:51.011
On the evening before gladiators
appeared in the arena,

41:51.094 --> 41:53.555
they were given a last supper.

41:53.639 --> 41:56.600
Spectators were actually allowed to
come and watch them eat this,

42:02.856 --> 42:06.610
and we have descriptions
of how some ate heartily

42:06.693 --> 42:08.612
and seemed to enjoy the occasion.

42:12.074 --> 42:15.160
And it must have been
a very poignant scene.

42:30.843 --> 42:32.219
How's your neck, Emperor?

42:32.719 --> 42:33.971
It's just a scratch.

42:34.471 --> 42:36.348
The badge of any true gladiator.

42:38.851 --> 42:39.977
Wear it with honor.

42:43.188 --> 42:44.606
Look...

42:44.982 --> 42:47.025
You were right to push me.

42:48.485 --> 42:51.738
It would have been unfair
to send you into the arena unprepared.

42:53.115 --> 42:55.868
I failed my duty as your trainer.
Will you forgive me?

42:56.368 --> 42:57.703
I already have.

43:01.790 --> 43:03.041
Listen to them.

43:06.461 --> 43:09.298
You are part of a brotherhood now.

43:10.424 --> 43:13.760
“To be burned, to be bound, to be beaten,

43:16.054 --> 43:18.140
and to be killed by the sword.

43:19.433 --> 43:21.852
Those men out there in the pit,
they're your...

43:23.061 --> 43:24.104
they're your family.

43:28.066 --> 43:29.484
So am I,

43:30.986 --> 43:32.946
and I know you will do us honor.

43:35.365 --> 43:36.491
Brother.

43:54.718 --> 43:56.678
Commodus has laid the groundwork

43:56.762 --> 44:01.892
for the most impressive show of games
 the Empire has ever seen.

44:04.561 --> 44:07.689
And while the Emperor knows
 he's not ready to fight,

44:08.357 --> 44:10.692
he still decides to move forward,

44:11.527 --> 44:14.363
determined to secure his legacy.

44:15.322 --> 44:16.532
My brothers.

44:17.366 --> 44:20.244
Tomorrow is the beginning
 of 14 days of games.

44:23.872 --> 44:27.334
The greatest that have been
since the dedication of the Coliseum.

44:30.796 --> 44:33.757
Untold glory awaits us.

44:35.300 --> 44:40.138
By the time the festival is over,
 Rome will have been born anew,

44:41.557 --> 44:44.560
into an era of unprecedented greatness,

44:45.894 --> 44:48.814
and she will have been lifted there
 upon your mighty shoulders.

44:49.857 --> 44:53.694
As Emperor, I salute you.

44:56.113 --> 44:57.781
And as a Gladiator,

45:00.325 --> 45:02.494
it's an honor to be one of you.

45:11.587 --> 45:13.881
I will endure to be burned,

45:14.381 --> 45:16.550
to be bound, to be beaten,

45:19.094 --> 45:20.971
and to be killed by the sword.

45:29.563 --> 45:32.774
-"I will endure to be burned..."
-"I will endure to be burned..."

45:32.858 --> 45:34.193
