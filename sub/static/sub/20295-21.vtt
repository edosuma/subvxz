-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.367 --> 00:36.433
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.000
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.033 --> 00:41.167
in a court of law.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.033
-I work
auto theft investigations,

00:45.067 --> 00:46.800
which appealed to me

00:46.833 --> 00:48.267
because it involved
being in the field more,

00:48.300 --> 00:50.600
and bein' out and about,
not workin' behind a desk.

00:50.633 --> 00:51.900
There's a lot of stolen cars
out there,

00:51.933 --> 00:53.733
specifically
in the Sacramento region.

00:53.767 --> 00:56.800
We get a lot of cases
where it's one or two guys

00:56.833 --> 00:58.867
that are doing repeated cars,

00:58.900 --> 01:03.133
and by arresting them
and gettin' 'em off the streets,

01:03.167 --> 01:08.267
you can make a huge difference
in the auto theft crime rate.

01:08.300 --> 01:13.500
-(siren blaring)
-We're gonna try to stop
this vehicle up here,

01:13.533 --> 01:15.800
drivin' a high rate of speed.

01:15.833 --> 01:20.933
Westbound Bomark,
comin' up on... Tyler,

01:20.967 --> 01:23.067
silver Cadillac, no plates.

01:23.067 --> 01:26.300
Driving extremely erratically.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.300
Which way did he go?
-Left, left, left.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.433
-Hit a garbage can.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.333
Comin' up on Frizell,
and goin' westbound Frizell,

01:41.367 --> 01:45.567
from Tyler.
Uh, hit a garbage can.

01:49.433 --> 01:54.467
All right, he blew the stop
at Holly Court...
or Dolly Court.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.100
On the wrong side of the road.
He should be comin' up
on Hillsdale right now.

02:01.433 --> 02:04.433
-Oh, 901.
-Oh.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.733
-He's still goin'.
He's still goin'.

02:05.767 --> 02:10.800
-East two, 901, 901,
rollover, Hillsdale
and Frizell.

02:10.833 --> 02:12.500
Multi-vehicle.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.233
-Holy...

02:14.267 --> 02:16.533
-(indistinct radio transmission)

02:19.300 --> 02:22.167
-Hands! Hands!
Get your hands up!

02:22.200 --> 02:23.733
-Stay on the ground!
-I do!

02:23.767 --> 02:25.567
-Keep your hands right there!

02:25.600 --> 02:26.800
-Do not move!

02:26.833 --> 02:30.800
-(voice on radio)
East Two, one at gunpoint.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.567
-Do not move.
-I'm not, sir.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.233
-We'll get you medical attention
in a sec, okay?

02:34.267 --> 02:37.767
-I just wanna call my girl.
-I got you, we'll take care
of that.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.767
-I just wanna call my wife, man.
-Do not go back in the car.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.533
We need him handcuffed.
-All right.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.067
Dude, do not move!
-I'm not, sir.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.167
-Be careful.
He's got blood all over him.
-I'm not, sir.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.867
-Glove up, if you can glove up,
glove up.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.633
-I'll-- I'll-- I'll--
-Hey, who else is in the car
with you, dude?

02:49.667 --> 02:51.933
-Uh, nobody, sir.
-Hey, who's in the car with you?

02:51.967 --> 02:54.967
-Nobody, sir.
I was goin' to get something
to eat with my daughter.

02:55.067 --> 02:58.800
That's it, man.
-I'm gonna go check on them.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.467
I'm gonna check on them.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.067
-(siren approaching)

03:05.333 --> 03:07.067
-Woman: He totaled my car!
-I know.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.700
-And I'm still payin' on it!

03:08.733 --> 03:11.367
-Okay, you're not--
you're gonna be fine, ma'am.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.867
-Help me get-- Ah, my (bleep)
fell out.

03:13.900 --> 03:18.300
Get him up!
-I can't-- I can't believe
he lived.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.100
-Boy, you're lucky.
-Let's go have a seat.

03:20.133 --> 03:24.167
-Can you walk?
-Let's have a seat.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.900
-He passes us on Walerga
near Hillsdale,

03:26.933 --> 03:29.067
already at a high rate of speed,
going in the opposite direction.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.633
We're not lit up,
he doesn't see us.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.367
We fl-- It looked like
he had just done something.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.833
We flip. We don't catch him
till Bomark, where
you're makin' all those doglegs

03:36.867 --> 03:39.067
through Bomark?
We immediately go
lights and siren.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.567
He is smokin' every corner.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.400
He is cuttin' off cars.
He's blowin' every stop sign.

03:42.433 --> 03:45.867
And then
hits this stale red,
and does that.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.267
We got pressure on her thumb.
She's got a pretty bad
laceration.

03:48.300 --> 03:52.433
The lady in the black and white
floral shirt is the Civic driver
and she's--

03:52.467 --> 03:56.267
she's okay, she's
walking wounded.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.500
Hey, James, who'd that car
belong to?

03:57.533 --> 03:59.267
-I just bought
the mother (bleep).

03:59.300 --> 04:01.467
So it's your car?
-Yeah.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.300
-Okay. Why were you goin'
so fast, dude?

04:04.333 --> 04:06.700
-I didn't even mean to,
man, I didn't even know
I was drivin'

04:06.733 --> 04:07.933
somethin' like that
and goin' fast.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.667
-You didn't realize
you were goin' fast?
-No.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.800
-Well,
how'd that accident happen?
-Man, I knew I was goin' fast

04:11.833 --> 04:14.133
then, when you guys
turned around and I looked,
and I seen

04:14.167 --> 04:15.900
you were on me.
-So when did you see us?

04:15.933 --> 04:18.600
I didn't know it was y'all
until y'all hit your sirens.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.367
Right down there
when you turned on your sirens,
right before I started swervin'.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.333
-Well, let me ask you
a question, let me ask you
a question.

04:23.367 --> 04:24.967
Were you tryin'
to get away from us?

04:25.067 --> 04:27.067
-I'm tryin' to get away
from a mother (bleep)
shootin' at me, man,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.767
I didn't know.
-Who was shootin' at you?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.700
-Anybody, man,
you know how fools is.

04:31.733 --> 04:34.433
-Okay, this is the path
that the pursuit just went down,

04:34.467 --> 04:37.500
and we got a call
from a citizen that there
was a gun found

04:37.533 --> 04:38.700
on one of these driveways.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.833
-Here?
-Yeah. Oh.

04:40.867 --> 04:43.933
Right here.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.900
And it's cracked.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.967
You got an eyeball on it?
I'm gonna see who found it.

04:53.067 --> 04:54.367
How're you doin'?
-Good.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.500
-What happened, what'd you--
-(speaks Spanish)

04:58.533 --> 05:02.500
-(speaking Spanish)
-He said when he got home
from work,

05:02.533 --> 05:06.233
when he parked the car,
he saw the-- the gun,
just sittin' right there.

05:06.267 --> 05:10.167
-Okay.
-And earlier, earlier on,
there was sort of like,

05:10.200 --> 05:12.467
a bunch of like, cops
just passin' by her street.
-Yeah, like a chase?

05:12.500 --> 05:15.533
-Real fast, like a chase, yeah,
there you go.
-Okay, yeah, that was us.

05:15.567 --> 05:18.400
We chased a car through--
through here, so it's--

05:18.433 --> 05:19.900
-It makes it pretty obvious
why he was goin'.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.367
-Yeah. It's awesome
that you found it, thank you
very much.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.633
-All right.
-I appreciate it.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.733
All right, guys.

05:29.133 --> 05:32.633
Mm?
-Were there two
in the vehicle or one?

05:32.667 --> 05:34.167
-One.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.133
May have gone out
the sunroof or who knows.

05:37.167 --> 05:40.067
I'm gonna grab some gloves
and throw it in a bag.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.300
-He said he saw us,
didn't recognize us
as cops.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.833
He said he didn't see
our lights until right
over here?

05:44.867 --> 05:46.900
And at that point, he knew
we were cops, he tried
to slow down,

05:46.933 --> 05:49.333
he was goin' too fast.
He said he was running from us
because he thought

05:49.367 --> 05:50.733
we were gonna kill him.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.267
He thought
he was gettin' shot at.
-Oh, he's full of it.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.467
-So...

05:55.500 --> 05:57.833
-Did you see where the tire
ended up?
-No.

05:57.867 --> 06:00.700
-Over here in this front yard?
So the missing wheel
off that car

06:00.733 --> 06:03.867
is over by this tree
in the bushes
right over here.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.333
-Holy...

06:10.100 --> 06:12.367
Are you kidding me?

06:14.167 --> 06:17.800
-I'm just glad
there wasn't some innocent
citizen comin' out here

06:17.833 --> 06:19.433
to put the trash out
or somethin'.

06:19.467 --> 06:22.267
-And then if you look
at the drive tire
that's on the car now,

06:22.300 --> 06:25.067
it's totally bald,
so he's been
layin' rubber all over.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.800
-Yeah, I imagine
he's just drivin' like a jackass
and been gettin' away.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.167
-Tom... this
is the owner of the car.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.667
-You're-- you're the owner
of the car?

06:33.700 --> 06:36.900
-I let him use it,
he didn't bring it back
for like, two-- two days.

06:36.933 --> 06:39.367
-Two days he had it.
-I let him use it.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.633
-Is it registered
in your name?

06:40.667 --> 06:44.200
-Not yet, it was--
I just-- got the dealer--

06:44.233 --> 06:46.167
from the d--
-Were you gonna report it?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.133
-I was going to.
-You were gonna report it.

06:48.167 --> 06:51.533
-Yes, because, I know
his mom.
-Okay.

06:51.567 --> 06:52.700
I'm gonna take him
over to my car.

06:52.733 --> 06:54.067
And we're gonna take
a stolen report.

06:54.067 --> 06:58.267
Right now, the suspect's
in custody for vehicle theft,

06:58.300 --> 07:02.067
possession of stolen vehicle,
and felony evading,
with injuries,

07:02.100 --> 07:04.900
which is by far
the most serious charge.

07:04.933 --> 07:08.933
Uh, those two ladies
were injured, and hopefully,
they're gonna be okay.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.100
-I've been with Lubbock PD
for just over 10 years.

07:16.133 --> 07:20.867
I'd graduated
from Texas Tech University
with a degree in graphic design.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.733
I had a friend that,
he's actually a captain

07:22.767 --> 07:24.867
with
the Lubbock Police Department
at the time,

07:24.900 --> 07:26.367
but we had been friends
all growin' up,

07:26.400 --> 07:29.233
and, uh, just, some
of the stories that he told,

07:29.267 --> 07:32.533
some of the things that he did
just sounded like it would be

07:32.567 --> 07:34.733
somethin' that'd kinda
interest me.

07:34.767 --> 07:37.700
-72-55.
-(voice on radio) 72-55.

07:37.733 --> 07:40.467
-I'm gonna be behind
the suspect vehicle
for the robbery.

07:40.500 --> 07:45.900
We're westbound on Parkway
just underneath
the interstate overpass.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.800
This vehicle matches
the description
of a suspect vehicle

07:51.833 --> 07:55.300
in a home invasion robbery
that happened over
on the west side of town.

07:55.333 --> 08:00.333
Uh, the victim claimed
that two suspects
that were in this vehicle,

08:00.367 --> 08:03.867
uh, entered his house,
um, had him at gunpoint,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.967
and stole multiple items.
One of the things stolen

08:06.067 --> 08:08.700
was the victim's rifle.

08:08.733 --> 08:12.533
We're in the right hand lane,
by Flying J's,
turnin' into Flying J's.

08:12.567 --> 08:17.333
We're gonna go ahead
and try to initiate
a traffic stop on the vehicle,

08:17.367 --> 08:21.567
and see if we can't locate
the-- the suspects involved.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.900
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

08:34.933 --> 08:36.300
Let me see your hands!

08:36.333 --> 08:37.833
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

08:37.867 --> 08:39.800
Now! Put your hands
where I can see 'em,
on the steering wheel,

08:39.833 --> 08:42.400
right now.

08:43.867 --> 08:47.567
Stay where I can see 'em.
-What up?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.767
What's goin' on, dude?
-Keep your hands
where we can see 'em,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.500
you hear me?
-Yes, sir,
I understand.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.967
-Step out.

08:57.067 --> 09:02.067
Keep your hands up.
Hands up, turn around.
Turn around.

09:02.067 --> 09:06.700
Let me have your right hand.
Let me have your left hand.

09:06.733 --> 09:10.133
-(sirens approaching)

09:10.167 --> 09:14.067
-There's a gun right there
on the seat.
-Yeah, I see it.

09:18.533 --> 09:20.600
-Here, step back
to the side, back of the car.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.767
There's a gun
in the front seat.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.700
Is that gun real?
-It's not concealed...

09:26.733 --> 09:30.533
Somebody clear that gun
right there.

09:30.567 --> 09:34.067
-Man, I just got done
ballin', what you screwin'
with me for?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.633
Y'all serious?

09:35.667 --> 09:39.100
-Nothin' on you, right?
Guns, bombs...
-No, sir, I turned 'em in,

09:39.133 --> 09:41.367
I got my money, that's it.
-Where's your money at?

09:41.400 --> 09:44.133
-My money is my money,
I ain't tellin' you
where my money's at.

09:44.167 --> 09:48.700
-It's gonna be a Smith & Wesson
.22 long.

09:51.533 --> 09:56.133
-Check this out.
Said a rifle, right?

09:56.167 --> 10:00.667
-Yeah.
-A rifle, an Xbox,
cash, shoes, a shirt.

10:00.700 --> 10:04.700
-That's gonna be the gun
that was stolen from our victim
in our robbery

10:04.733 --> 10:06.900
at, uh, Hunter's Way.

10:06.933 --> 10:12.700
I guess they robbed him
at gunpoint, and they stole
his money and his rifle.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.367
-There's a gun
in your front seat,

10:16.400 --> 10:18.133
and there's a rifle
in the back seat.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.267
-That ain't mine.
-Okay.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.800
-We were playin' basketball,
I swear.
-This is the deal,

10:22.833 --> 10:25.800
pretend I have no idea
where you were
or who you are, okay?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.867
All I'm tryin' to figure out
is what happened today.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.300
-All right,
we were ballin', right?

10:29.333 --> 10:31.233
-Okay, where were you
ballin' at?
-At this park,

10:31.267 --> 10:32.933
I don't know (bleep)
this is.
-Okay.

10:32.967 --> 10:36.433
-I know one is Ray.
Like I've only met him,
like, two, three times.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.167
But he was cool, you know,
so hey, whatever.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.033
-Okay. Okay.
So, y'all-- y'all
are playin',

10:40.067 --> 10:45.067
you and Ray Ray--
-Me, Ray, his G,
and some black guys,

10:45.100 --> 10:47.200
I really don't--
I don't trust 'em,
that's what I'm tellin' you.

10:47.233 --> 10:49.600
-So at what point
did the rifle get in your car?

10:49.633 --> 10:51.700
-When he put it in there,
I guess.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.867
-But put it in there from where?
Did you see him
put it in there?

10:53.900 --> 10:55.700
-I don't know, but I did,
and we're playin' basketball,

10:55.733 --> 10:57.433
he said I'm gonna throw
my shirt in here, all right,

10:57.467 --> 10:59.367
cool. I didn't know
what he was talkin' about.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.200
-Okay.

11:01.233 --> 11:04.433
-He's got like 300 bucks
or somethin' in it,
that was in his sock

11:04.467 --> 11:08.567
of his pants.
-Okay, he took money,
too, right? During the robbery?

11:08.600 --> 11:11.067
-So I took it out,
I put it in an envelope,
I put it back in there.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.467
So he wouldn't flip out
about it.
-Okay.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.567
-But I haven't counted it,
I haven't gone through it yet,

11:15.600 --> 11:17.267
I don't know how much
was taken over there.

11:17.300 --> 11:21.333
-I may call... Did we see it?
I didn't even look
to see if there's a shirt

11:21.367 --> 11:23.667
or whatever
that matches what
they're talkin' about, but...

11:23.700 --> 11:25.400
-I don't know.
-I need to call
Brandon real quick,

11:25.433 --> 11:28.133
and find out specifics,
like how much money,
and stuff like that.

11:28.167 --> 11:30.567
-Right, right.
-Yeah. He's the one
takin' the report, I think.

11:30.600 --> 11:36.333
If we could figure out
approximately how much money,
um... things like that.

11:36.367 --> 11:39.533
-Okay, so we need this
for sure... definitely this.

11:39.567 --> 11:43.300
Let's go with that.
These were stolen.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.500
-I didn't
do a mother (bleep) thing.

11:47.533 --> 11:51.067
That's why
what's every cop wanting
to follow me I was, what's up?

11:51.067 --> 11:53.233
Hey, what the (bleep)
you doin', bro?

11:53.267 --> 11:56.467
I don't know what the (bleep)
is goin' on, them (bleep)
might've did it, I don't know.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.600
And I pulled up here
just to put some gas,
and y'all started

11:59.633 --> 12:03.833
(bleep) with me.
I mean, I understand why,
but damn.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.067
I didn't (bleep)
do nothin' to hurt nobody.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.833
Dude, why am I doin',
it's a Monday, my day off,
I work tomorrow.

12:08.867 --> 12:10.800
-Okay.
-I ain't tryin'--

12:10.833 --> 12:14.067
-Well, this-- this is the deal,
I'm just gonna be honest
with you, okay?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.900
What you're bein' charged
with right now
is aggravated robbery,

12:16.933 --> 12:20.067
and unlawful carrying
of a weapon.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.067
-I got that carrying
a weapon, I understand
that's me (bleep),

12:23.067 --> 12:26.400
I tell you, that's me.
-Okay. I'm just sayin'
right now,

12:26.433 --> 12:30.467
the reason for the charge
is because everything
stacks up that you're involved--

12:30.500 --> 12:32.533
that you're involved
in a robbery.

12:32.567 --> 12:35.833
Because let me explain to you
what's goin'-- the seriousness
of what's happenin', okay?

12:35.867 --> 12:39.733
The gun in your back seat
is stolen from a home invasion.
-A home invasion?

12:39.767 --> 12:41.967
-It wasn't like somebody
just dropped it in your seat,
it was stolen

12:42.067 --> 12:45.533
from a home invasion.
Okay? A gun was used
during the home invasion.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.867
I found a gun between
your seat and your console.

12:47.900 --> 12:52.167
-That's mine.
-I know. Which leads me
to believe... what?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.600
-(bleep) I don't know.
-That you might've
been involved.

12:54.633 --> 12:58.067
-You tryin' to say
I'm a robber. Hey,
I'm not (bleep)...

12:58.067 --> 13:00.333
Do you think I'm like
some schemin' ass
mother (bleep)?

13:00.367 --> 13:02.967
-I-- I'm not sayin' that.
I'm just sayin' that
the rifle that was found

13:03.067 --> 13:05.333
in your car
was from a home invasion.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.567
-See, and if I would have
said that--

13:06.600 --> 13:07.933
-Along
with the pair of shoes, what--

13:07.967 --> 13:09.900
the white pair of shoes?
-The white pair of shoes
are probably

13:09.933 --> 13:11.633
that little (bleep) G,
'cause he was short.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.733
I don't know the (bleep) he is.
-Well, they were also stolen
in a... robbery.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.233
-Oh, (bleep) I don't know,
either.
-Okay.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.967
-That's the suspect,
that's the stolen rifle,
the stolen tennis shoes

13:20.067 --> 13:22.233
are in the car,
that black sweater's the one
he was wearin'

13:22.267 --> 13:25.233
when he did it.
He's got half the money
that was taken in his sock.

13:25.267 --> 13:28.667
I don't know
who plays basketball with $372
in their sock.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.833
-The City of Lynn's
approximately 120,000 people.

13:34.867 --> 13:36.567
I was born and raised here.

13:36.600 --> 13:41.300
It's predominately working-class
people. We do have
a large addiction problem,

13:41.333 --> 13:42.833
mainly heroin right now.

13:42.867 --> 13:45.067
We try to be compassionate
with people.

13:45.067 --> 13:48.400
You know... you meet
your friends, and, you know,
people you grew up with,

13:48.433 --> 13:49.933
and they fall upon hard times,

13:49.967 --> 13:52.500
or they've-- you know,
they're sufferin'
with an addiction,

13:52.533 --> 13:55.933
and, you know, you're tryin'
to help 'em, but at the same
time, you gotta do your job

13:55.967 --> 14:01.500
and, you know, maintain,
you know... some order
with them.

14:01.533 --> 14:06.867
Um... they may not like it
at first, but, you know,
usually they come around.

14:06.900 --> 14:11.467
Goin' to a disturbance call
right now. Uh...
just up the street here.

14:11.500 --> 14:15.133
This is an argument
on our computer, so...

14:15.167 --> 14:17.167
Let's see what's happenin'.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.933
Kid in the green shirt, Joe.
Walkin' back in the yard.

14:24.967 --> 14:26.400
Kid in the green shirt
right there.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.100
Just turned around,
walked in there.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.433
I don't know, he's takin' off...
looks like.

14:30.467 --> 14:33.067
Is he runnin'?

14:36.367 --> 14:39.667
12, foot pursuit,
Arlington to Western,
green shirt, white male,

14:39.700 --> 14:41.767
Get down on the ground!

14:41.800 --> 14:44.500
-I wasn't doing anything!
-Get down on the ground,
and stop!

14:44.533 --> 14:46.767
What are you runnin' for?
-I'm just runnin'
from the (bleep) nothing.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.967
-Relax.

14:48.067 --> 14:50.100
-I'm just skatin'.
-You're not skatin'.

14:50.133 --> 14:53.533
Stand up, hold on.
-Can I just sit down, sir?

14:53.567 --> 14:56.333
-Just put your hands up.
-Can I light this?

14:56.367 --> 14:58.133
-No, you're not lightin'
that right now.

14:58.167 --> 15:00.900
-Okay, why am I
bein' detained?
-Why are you runnin'?

15:03.567 --> 15:05.367
-Left hand, left hand,
left hand, left hand.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.900
-What's your name?
-Jonathan.

15:06.933 --> 15:10.567
-Jonathan what?
-That was my ID
right in there, sir.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.733
I don't consent
to any searches right now.
-No one's searchin' ya.

15:13.767 --> 15:17.300
-Search and seizure.
-Huh?

15:17.333 --> 15:21.233
-Okay, I'm not gonna
do anything, can I sit down?
-Why you shakin'?

15:21.267 --> 15:25.067
-Because my arm hurts.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.800
-Here, take it.
Here's my phone, my charger.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.267
-Do you have warrants
or somethin'?

15:31.300 --> 15:34.533
-No, sir.
-Just-- I get paranoid
when people start look--

15:34.567 --> 15:37.800
chasin' me, and comin' up to me.
-We didn't even say anything
to you, you took off

15:37.833 --> 15:40.067
from the backyard
and started runnin'...
-I know, because I'm stupid.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.433
for no reason.
-I know, 'cause I'm scared
of you guys, I don't know why.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.400
-All right, scared of what?
Has anybody hurt you right now?

15:44.433 --> 15:49.200
-No, Officer. I'm just--
I have an anxiety disorder,
that I get really upset,

15:49.233 --> 15:53.800
and scared and I start runnin'.
Can I sit, Officer, please?

15:56.100 --> 15:57.867
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry, guys, I--

15:57.900 --> 15:59.467
-Sit down, relax.
Go ahead.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.900
Have a seat. Is that your mom?

16:01.933 --> 16:04.833
-Yeah, it's her.
-He's got one?

16:04.867 --> 16:07.367
-No, I don't have a warrant.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.700
No warrants.
-You sure?

16:08.733 --> 16:10.767
-I'm more than positive.
I been to all my court dates.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.733
-You're supposed to be
over here?

16:12.767 --> 16:15.900
-Yeah.
-(voice on radio)

16:15.933 --> 16:18.500
-All right.
Finish your cigarette.

16:18.533 --> 16:20.933
-I didn't--
-You got a warrant.

16:20.967 --> 16:22.067
-I got a warrant?
-Yeah.

16:22.067 --> 16:25.733
-Ma... Ma, I got a warrant.
-What for?

16:25.767 --> 16:27.200
-I don't know, they say
I got a warrant.

16:27.233 --> 16:29.667
-From where?
-Can you-- where's the warrant?

16:29.700 --> 16:32.433
-Out of Boston.
-Out of Boston? They say
a violation of order,

16:32.467 --> 16:34.800
I didn't--
-Do you have a girlfriend
or a baby's mom are in Boston?

16:34.833 --> 16:37.167
I didn't violate
any order, officer.
-Does anyone

16:37.200 --> 16:40.067
have a restraining order on you?
-Not that I know of right now,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.200
my ex-baby mother did.
-Maybe that's why you violated.

16:42.233 --> 16:45.067
-I didn't violate. I'm in Lynn,
she lives in Dorchester.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.167
-Aw, that's out of Boston,
Dorchester's
outta Boston, right?

16:49.433 --> 16:52.067
-Yeah, but I'm over here,
she's over there.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.233
-Doesn't mean you can't
violate the law to call her
on the phone,

16:54.267 --> 16:56.200
text her...
-I didn't, though...

16:56.233 --> 16:59.400
-Send her an email.
-So I'm going to jail?

16:59.433 --> 17:02.100
-Yeah.
-(bleep) damn. Really?

17:02.133 --> 17:04.633
-Yeah.
-Till, what time?

17:04.667 --> 17:06.467
-Huh?
-Could I see the judge today?

17:06.500 --> 17:09.200
-Well, if you stop talkin',
put your stuff in your pockets,
we can get you there,

17:09.233 --> 17:11.067
and you get over there,
and maybe you can get out.

17:11.100 --> 17:13.833
-Let's get out of here.
Ma! Can you-- can you walk me
over to my mom with with this?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.533
-Yeah. I'll give her your stuff.
-No, no, don't give her
my stuff.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.400
-You want to give her
your board?
-Yeah.

17:18.433 --> 17:19.433
-Here, give me this.
-Ma.

17:19.467 --> 17:22.600
-Put your hands
behind your back.

17:25.533 --> 17:28.867
-All right, you good?
-Yeah, can we walk to my mom?

17:28.900 --> 17:31.233
-Hold on, hold on,
hold on a second. I'm not
carrying your stuff.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.400
-It's sad, man, it sucks.
-It does.

17:34.433 --> 17:37.067
-I want my money, too.
-You're keepin' your money.
I'm not touchin' your money.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.200
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-Relax.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.800
Here. Go ahead.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.667
-Mother:
What happened?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.667
-They have a warrant
for my arrest.
-From where?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.200
-From violation
of a restraining order.

17:49.233 --> 17:51.767
-So, can you bail me out?
-A restraining order?

17:51.800 --> 17:54.200
-Here's his board.
-What violation
of a restraining order?

17:54.233 --> 17:56.467
-I don't know, probably
the baby's mama.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.533
Oh, yeah, because
he went to court the other time.

17:59.567 --> 18:02.633
It's our house, he got a warrant
when he went to court.

18:02.667 --> 18:06.767
-He violated the order,
or she's alleging
that he violated the order.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.267
Okay? She's got an order
against him.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.200
-She's the one
who's violating
the restraining order

18:11.233 --> 18:14.333
by-- by coming to my house.
-Well, you gotta call us,
if she comes to the house,

18:14.367 --> 18:16.067
you have to call us.
-She-- she's still in my house.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.400
-Have you gotten an order
against her?
-I'm gonna tell her right now,

18:18.433 --> 18:20.333
she has to leave.
-All right, well, then,
go to court

18:20.367 --> 18:21.900
and get an order.
-Yeah.

18:21.933 --> 18:23.567
-You can go to court,
court's open right now,

18:23.600 --> 18:26.067
if you want, go get an order
to keep her away from you.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.800
-Yeah, okay, thank you.
-All right?

18:30.267 --> 18:32.067
Hey, listen...
-Yes, sir?

18:32.067 --> 18:34.633
-You know there's a violation
of the restraining order, right?
-I have no idea.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.067
-Whatever-- whatever
your baby's mama did.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.433
Does she live
at your mother's house with you?
-No.

18:38.467 --> 18:39.633
-She doesn't live there?
-No.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.433
-Is she always over here?
-No.

18:41.467 --> 18:45.633
-No? She just comes and goes?
-My girl does.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.333
-Your girl does?
-Yeah, not my BM.

18:47.367 --> 18:50.333
-No? All right.
-But... you know
you have the warrant.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.300
All right?
And it was a dead giveaway
when you turned around

18:52.333 --> 18:54.300
and took off.
-Mm-hm.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.200
-All right?
I mean, had you just
stayed there,

18:56.233 --> 18:58.133
we probably wouldn't have
ran ya.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.567
-Yeah, but still, I gotta
take care of these things.
-You do.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.433
'Cause what's gonna happen,
when you violate the order,

19:02.467 --> 19:05.367
you may not know
that you violated the order,
or that she called on you.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.167
-Yeah, I don't know,
I have no idea.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.400
-So they'll send a warrant
out for you.
-Yeah.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.767
-And they'll mail it
to your house.
-Okay, they didn't mail me

19:11.800 --> 19:14.367
anything, arraign me, nothin'.
-Nothin'? Well, you're not
gonna get arraigned.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.867
You're
gonna get mailed. Where does
your mail go to? Here?

19:17.900 --> 19:20.433
-Maybe it's 'cause
I didn't pay a court fee?
-That's probably it.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.567
-Because I went
into community service
and give 'em a slip,

19:22.600 --> 19:25.767
and maybe it didn't work,
maybe they wanted me to do it
with the courthouse.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.367
-I don't know. But...
-The judge will know, right?

19:29.400 --> 19:32.733
-Yeah. The jud-- they'll
figure it out, if you need
to pay somethin' or whatever,

19:32.767 --> 19:35.333
so...
-All right, I'm gonna
put my phone back in my pocket.

19:35.367 --> 19:38.233
-Okay. All right?
So you're goin' to Lynn,
you're goin'

19:38.267 --> 19:39.833

right now.
-Thank you.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.533

19:41.567 --> 19:43.567

or nothin'?
-You're gonna get booked, yeah.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.067
