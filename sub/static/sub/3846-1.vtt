00:49.091 --> 00:52.334
Hello, Cassie! Hiya, girl.
Hello there.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.631
Now, let's see.

00:57.266 --> 01:01.101
Looks like Mari's getting cards
from half the civilized world.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.144
Mari Collingwood.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.268
Mari Collingwood.
Mari Collingwood.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.985
You'd think she's the only kid
to reach the age of 17.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.025
Of course, she is about
the prettiest piece I've ever seen.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.828
Mari Collingwood,
you hurry up!

01:29.006 --> 01:30.338
Okay, okay.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.670
Drill sergeant.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.873
Did you call
the repair service?

02:13.050 --> 02:14.040
Mmm-hmm.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.210
Did you tell them I was a physician
and had to have a phone?

02:17.387 --> 02:20.551
No, actually, I told them
you were an international bookie

02:20.724 --> 02:23.842
and I was 10 months pregnant
with quintuplets.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.388
Hey, what's new
in the outside world?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.897
Same old stuff,
murder and mayhem.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.024
What's for
dinner tonight?

02:32.194 --> 02:33.651
Freezer's full,
take your choice.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.904
What's that supposed to mean?
Mari, I want you to be careful tonight.

02:37.074 --> 02:41.318
Your mother tells me the place
you're going is in a bad neighborhood.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.240
I will, Daddy.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.863
No bra?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.998
Of course not!
Nobody wears those anymore.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.034
Nobody except us drill sergeants.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.046
Yeah, but look, Estelle.
You can see her nipples as plain as day.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.922
Daddy, don't be so clinical.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.048
But it's immodest.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.425
Then I'll get some sandpaper!

02:57.594 --> 02:59.301
Look, young lady,
when I was your age...

02:59.471 --> 03:01.178
When you were my age,
you all wore brassieres

03:01.348 --> 03:03.465
that made your tits
stick out like torpedoes.

03:03.642 --> 03:07.431
Tits! What's this "tits" business?
Sounds like I'm back in the barracks.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.096
All right, then.
Mammary glands.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.266
They used to tie them up
like little lunatics in straitjackets

03:13.443 --> 03:15.901
- and they stuffed socks in their bras.
- Mari!

03:16.071 --> 03:17.937
You told me that
yourself, Mother.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.777
If God had meant
women to go around

03:19.950 --> 03:22.363
with their busts exposed,
Mari Collingwood,

03:22.536 --> 03:25.028
he wouldn't have
given us clothes!

03:25.956 --> 03:27.538
Who are you
gonna see tonight?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.574
- Bloodlust.
- Bloodlust?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.993
Yeah, Bloodlust.
What's wrong with them?

03:32.170 --> 03:33.661
I was just reading
about them.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.798
Aren't they the guys that dismember
live chickens during their act?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.503
They only did
that once, Daddy.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.213
Don't you feel sorry
for the chicken?

03:40.387 --> 03:43.755
Oh, Daddy, I couldn't tell you the
nights I cried myself to sleep

03:43.932 --> 03:45.218
over that chicken.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.550
Hey, have you
seen the car keys?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.717
On the table.

03:47.894 --> 03:48.884
I think it's crazy.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.018
What's crazy?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.349
All that blood and violence.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.061
I thought you were supposed to be
the love generation.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.725
Hey, that reminds me.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.858
What?

03:57.028 --> 03:58.860
Here's a little
something for you.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.231
Just a gift to tide you over
till tomorrow.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.445
Oh, Daddy!

04:04.077 --> 04:05.238
Daddy.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.322
Oh, Mother.
It's nice.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.498
Well, maybe it'll
bring you luck.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.331
By the way, who are you going out with
tonight? Anyone we know?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.336
Well, Phyllis Stone.

04:16.505 --> 04:17.587
Phyllis Stone?

04:17.882 --> 04:19.839
But, yeah... I know you
don't like her, Mother,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.172
but I'm safe with her.
She comes from that neighborhood.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.335
What neighborhood?

04:23.513 --> 04:26.506
Where the concert is.
You know, from that slum.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.140
I'm sure she does.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.891
Come on!
I got something for us.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.563
What?

04:34.733 --> 04:35.849
Come on.
You'll see.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.688
- Okay. Oh!
- Hurry up.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.941
'Who's Phyllis Stone?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.355
'You make her sound like
the bride of Frankenstein.'

04:42.532 --> 04:44.023
'She's the girl
that takes care of the horses

04:44.201 --> 04:46.784
'down the Johnson place,
isn't she, Mari?'

04:46.953 --> 04:48.285
'What worries you?'

04:48.455 --> 04:49.662
'From what
Nancy Springer tells me,

04:49.831 --> 04:52.949
'that's not all she takes
care of down there.'

04:53.126 --> 04:56.210
Mari tells me you're from Manhattan.
What does your father do?

04:56.379 --> 04:59.668
'Oh, my parents are
in the iron and steel business.'

04:59.841 --> 05:02.049
Iron and steel,
both together. How unusual.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.882
Yeah, well, my mother irons,
and my father steals.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.050
'Come on, Mari.'

05:07.557 --> 05:09.093
I wish we had some decent grass.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.222
- Yeah, it'd be nice to get stoned.
- You don't have any, do you, Mari?

05:12.312 --> 05:16.431
- No! Of course not. Me?
- Maybe we can get some before the concert.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.270
Yeah, the concert.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.569
I wonder what it would be like
to make it with Bloodlust.

05:22.739 --> 05:27.074
It would just be really soft.
Like in a whole bunch of cotton.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.485
You know what I mean?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.904
- Cotton?
- No! Soft and gentle.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.199
- Oh, give me a break!
- Really sensitive, not wild and gory.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.366
God!

05:35.544 --> 05:38.412
- You're too much, man. Cotton!
- No.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.334
It's Bloodlust, man!
Like, they're crazy!

05:41.508 --> 05:43.170
Like cotton candy, you know.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.589
The leaves
are beautiful.

06:27.762 --> 06:31.676
Yep! They're really starting to change.
I guess winter's coming on.

06:31.850 --> 06:36.185
Yep. Hey, I changed.
I changed this winter.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.686
What do you mean,
you changed?

06:37.856 --> 06:40.724
I mean,
my breasts filled out.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.643
Yeah, didn't you notice? Look.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.402
I mean, they were
nothing last summer.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.779
I didn't know you
last summer.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.110
I know. Well, they have.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.820
Well, congratulations!

06:50.994 --> 06:54.283
Come on. I feel like a woman
for the first time in my life.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.663
Yeah?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.914
Rodney Johnson!

07:27.030 --> 07:28.237
You're crazy!

07:28.406 --> 07:31.524
'The police have already
spread their dragnet over a five-state area

07:31.618 --> 07:33.530
'in their effort to
apprehend the fugitives...'

07:33.620 --> 07:36.328
- 'Far out! This is gorgeous.'
- 'According to reliable sources...'

07:37.832 --> 07:39.243
'Leave that on, Phyllis.
I want to hear it.'

07:40.877 --> 07:43.585
'The daring daylight
escape of the two convicted murderers,

07:43.755 --> 07:47.715
'dope pushers and rapists
cost the lives of two prison guards

07:47.884 --> 07:50.547
'and surprisingly,
the life of a German shepherd.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.007
'According to eyewitness
reports, the animal,

07:53.181 --> 07:55.764
'which was sent after the two
fleeing men, was kicked to death

07:55.934 --> 07:59.928
'by a young, animal-like woman

08:00.105 --> 08:03.223
'The alleged driver of the car

08:03.733 --> 08:06.942
'Junior Stillo is the illegitimate son
of the leader of the two escapees,

'Krug Stillo, who was serving a life
sentence for the 1966 triple slaying

08:11.908 --> 08:13.774
'of a priest and two nuns.

'Krug Stillo is reputed to have

'but expect them to try to leave

08:49.571 --> 08:52.109
Thanks. Sounds like good advice.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.279
Sadie!

08:56.953 --> 08:58.239
- Yeah?
- Hurry up out of there!

08:58.413 --> 08:59.654
I want to take a bath, too.

08:59.831 --> 09:03.791
Okay, okay! Hey, what do you think
of your new clothes?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.917
I handpicked them at Korvette's.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.123
Wonderful.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.680
- Who is it?
- It's J. Edgar Hoover.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.351
- Any trouble?
- No.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.028
Where's Sadie?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.283
Taking a bath.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.653
Hey, is Junior back yet?

09:41.331 --> 09:42.993
Yeah, and I'm here, too.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.247
Send him in with my beer, okay?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.498
You heard her.

09:45.668 --> 09:49.503
Go to the icebox and get a beer.
There's a lady in there, man.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.807
Here's your beer, Sadie.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.818
There he is,
the man of the hour.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.863
Thank you.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.652
You glad your old man's
out of the clink?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.321
Yeah, sure.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.709
You know, it's really a shame
you don't get along better with Krug.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.790
You got to change
your head around.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.251
Become someone else altogether.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.882
I've been thinking about
names and everything.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.840
How does "Agatha Greenwood"
grab you?

10:43.017 --> 10:45.384
Like something
out of Brighter Day.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.519
Yeah, you're
probably right.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.981
What do you want to be?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.484
- A frog.
- You look like a frog.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.230
If I was a frog,
I'd have my own lily pad.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.899
I could sit there
all day long, just...

11:02.203 --> 11:04.320
I could do that, man,
and nobody would bother me.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.738
I could watch the flies.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.676
- Better watch him, Krug!
- Hey.

11:27.896 --> 11:32.436
Leave Sadie alone, you little toad,
or I'll squash you flat as a lily pad.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.407
- Do we have time before the concert?
- Sure, don't worry about it.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.613
Goodie! I want to have
at least two scoops.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.369
I know exactly what I'm going to have.
Mint chocolate chip.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.746
- A mint chocolate chip?
- Yeah.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.373
No, I don't like that.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.783
What's this
yellow stuff right here?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.917
Lemon sherbet.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.794
Sherbet.
I don't want sherbet.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.205
Oh, can I taste yours?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.669
Make your own.
What do you want?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.257
I don't want that. I want...
What else do you have?

12:02.472 --> 12:05.510
Banana Royal, Neapolitan,
Maple Walnut, Tutti-Frutti...

12:05.683 --> 12:08.050
- Nut!
- Nuts for the nut.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.520
Big goon, put me down!

12:14.025 --> 12:14.981
I hate you!

12:16.653 --> 12:17.609
Let me up.

12:17.779 --> 12:22.149
Hey, forget it! You got the cream
of American manhood here.

12:22.325 --> 12:25.159
The cream of American manhood.
That's good, Krug!

12:25.328 --> 12:27.945
Shut up! And get away
from my woman.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.159
Your woman?
I thought she was our woman.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.326
Just a minute! Buzz off!
I'm not neither of yours woman.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.119
I am my own frigging woman!

12:35.296 --> 12:36.878
- She's right, Krug.
- You shut up!

12:37.048 --> 12:39.005
Hey, what have
you been doing?

12:39.175 --> 12:42.293
Reading them creep women lib magazines
while I was up in the jug?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.631
Maybe.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.173
Why don't you just lay back
and enjoy being inferior?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.933
Zoom off!
You male chauvinist dog!

12:50.853 --> 12:52.515
- Pig, Sadie.
- What?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.021
Male chauvinist pig.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.931
Okay, you male
chauvinist pig!

12:56.109 --> 12:57.975
- She's right, Krug.
- You shut up!

12:58.152 --> 13:02.487
I ain't putting out anymore until I get
a couple of more chicks around here.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.864
Couple of more chicks?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.865
Yeah. Equal representation.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.027
- What, are you crazy?
- She's right, Krug.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.866
Get out of here!

13:10.039 --> 13:13.908
God! This neighborhood's awful.
It's so dirty. My mother was right.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.202
Come on, it's not awful,
it's just funky. That's all.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.495
Dirt all over the place.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.540
Keep your eyes open for someone
who might be dealing.

13:21.843 --> 13:22.799
Yeah.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.677
- Want me to ask him?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.218
Hey, man.

13:32.395 --> 13:37.186
You don't know where we could
score on some good grass, do you?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.896
- Nah, I don't know that stuff.
- Thanks.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.651
- Bummer.
- Come on.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.236
Oh, man! Hey, hey, lady!
Come on back here.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.196
Let's get together.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.614
Yeah?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.205
I do happen to have
in my possession

13:54.000 --> 13:57.038
an extra ounce
of good stuff.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.952
Oh yeah, what kind?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.086
Colombian.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.417
- Colombian?
- Yeah.

14:01.591 --> 14:02.832
Far out!

14:03.551 --> 14:06.294
- How much?
- $20.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.256
$20, and it's Colombian?

14:10.433 --> 14:13.221
Yeah, well, you know, I need the money,
but if that's too high...

14:13.394 --> 14:17.138
No, no, no! That's great.
We'll take it. How do we get it?

14:21.778 --> 14:22.768
Oh, uh...

14:23.154 --> 14:24.690
This is my roommate, Sam.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.854
Hiya, girls!

14:26.032 --> 14:28.319
This is my sister, Martha.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.736
Martha, these girls, you know,
want to buy some grass.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.700
Come on in.
Come on in.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.955
- Gotcha!
- Oh, shit!

14:42.048 --> 14:44.085
Hey, stick around a while.
How about a bite?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.500
Yeah, I'd like a little something
to eat myself.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.294
Nice going, junkie.
Here's your yum-yums.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.973
- So much for him.
- Now, I don't want you girls to worry.

14:56.479 --> 15:00.439
I mean, we just wanted some company.
That's all, you know.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.726
No, it wasn't that
expensive at all.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.269
Looks good.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.203
This room belongs
in a magazine.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.865
Not bad,
if I do say so. Hmm.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.463
I feel like a bridegroom.
I'm hearing bells.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.424
I have a cake in the oven.
Come on.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.133
A cake?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.845
You wanted some grass?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.892
What do you want
with some grass?

15:41.482 --> 15:44.316
Hey, you guys
ain't cows, is ya?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.691
Little cows looking
for some grass?

15:48.489 --> 15:50.697
Let me hear you moo. Come on.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.777
Yeah, but they got some
cute little udders on them.

15:55.955 --> 16:00.199
You guys let us the hell out of here,
or I'm going to start screaming!

16:08.384 --> 16:11.297
Hey, you gonna scream?

16:13.097 --> 16:14.338
Listen.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.259
Let me give you
a little bit of free advice.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.428
If you make one peep...

17:04.106 --> 17:05.597
Cockeyed as hell.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.940
John, I should have
bought one at the bakery.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.771
They had such
pretty ones there.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.654
Nonsense.
It's truly remarkable.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.405
Come on in the living room.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.031
I want to attack you.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.491
Listen. Why don't
you guys let us go?

17:20.665 --> 17:22.122
We know you were
just kidding around.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.452
- Oh, yes.
- We'll split,

17:23.626 --> 17:26.618
and we won't say anything
to anybody, I swear.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.621
You must think
we're pretty stupid.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.961
No.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.587
We ain't stupid.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.344
We might be

17:42.353 --> 17:43.810
horny old pigs,

17:44.313 --> 17:47.556
but we ain't stupid.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.023
Get your
hands away, Sadie.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.859
Come on, Krug.
I had her first. Please.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.490
I said get your
hands away, bitch!

18:02.832 --> 18:04.414
Chicken breast.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.534
Phyllis!

18:08.254 --> 18:10.166
Do that again,
and you're dead.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.830
Easy, Weasel.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.509
We don't want to off somebody
the first night out.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.885
I mean,

18:17.722 --> 18:21.511
it'd be a shame to get this floor
all messed up with blood.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.018
Be so messy.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.557
You see,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.901
there are other ways
to do things.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.069
No!

18:43.706 --> 18:45.072
Stop it.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.041
No. No.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.427
Castle's ready.
Here's to the princess.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.171
To the princess!

19:10.399 --> 19:11.981
To her queen.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.669
Come on!

20:04.829 --> 20:07.617
Okay, sweetheart, I'll put you
right on top of your friend here.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.622
Take it easy,
you could hurt 'em.

20:09.792 --> 20:10.782
They're okay.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.703
Okay, the both of you settle down,
you got a long ride ahead.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.415
I'm outta here.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.258
Yes.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.809
- 'It's pretty common, you know?'
- Yes, I understand.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.851
'Sure she hasn't called?'

20:31.021 --> 20:32.137
No, she hasn't.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.146
'Well, sorry I couldn't
have been of more help.'

20:34.316 --> 20:37.150
Why, thank you very much.
You're very kind.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.315
- Goodbye.
- 'Goodbye.'

20:43.033 --> 20:44.274
Nothing?

20:44.994 --> 20:49.034
The theater manager said that concert
was over at 2:00 this morning.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.032
Well, it's dawn now.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.080
We'll wait an hour,
then we'll call the police.

20:55.254 --> 20:59.373
Come on! Things are not that bad.
At least we have our phone again.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.250
She's all right.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.046
Staying out all night,
well, it's classic.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.509
It's a kid's way of
saying she's grown up.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.515
It's that damn
Phyllis Stone's fault.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.849
All right, don't, Estelle!
Now, she'll come home.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.308
Let her have a fling.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.248
Taking them girls, you know,
that's the kind of crime

22:19.421 --> 22:21.253
people never
forgive you for.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.755
A sex crime.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.837
Shut up, Weasel!
You're disturbing my rhythm.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.969
How would you do this
sex crime business, anyway?

22:28.138 --> 22:31.722
My brother Sol, the plumber,
he makes twice as much money as me

22:31.892 --> 22:33.554
and gets three weeks vacation, too.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.389
Shut up, shithead!

22:37.940 --> 22:39.602
You think the cops
is closing in on us?

22:39.775 --> 22:42.688
I don't know, I just got
this feeling at the back of my neck.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.649
Maybe you got crabs.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.958
Sex crime!

23:04.133 --> 23:06.591
I wonder what the meanest,
foulest, rottenest,

23:06.760 --> 23:08.717
raunchiest sex crime ever was.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.973
Hey, Sadie! What do you think
the sex crime of the century was?

23:13.684 --> 23:14.845
Oh, shit!

23:15.019 --> 23:16.681
Hey, I'm serious!

23:18.439 --> 23:19.896
I ought to kill you.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.831
How 'bout the Boston Strangler?
I always admired him.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.866
- Bush league!
- I got it!

23:40.044 --> 23:42.331
- You sure?
- Yeah! Frood!

23:43.047 --> 23:45.460
- Frood?
- Sigmund Frood!

23:45.716 --> 23:49.551
Do you remember when a telephone pole
was just a telephone pole?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.006
Yeah.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.762
Not anymore, sweetheart.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.181
It's a giant puh-hay-lis.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.842
- Puh-hay-lis?
- Puh-hay-lis?

23:57.019 --> 24:00.558
I can't even look at the Grand Canyon
anymore without crossing my legs.

24:00.731 --> 24:01.721
It's bullshit.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.232
This icing is delicious.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.108
You must get a lot of hysterical parents
calling you now, huh, Sheriff?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.147
Well, it's not that unusual,
Mrs. Collingwood.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.361
Oh?

24:12.534 --> 24:14.025
No, we've been getting
a lot of calls like this

24:14.203 --> 24:15.694
in the past three or four years.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.534
Kids running off to the big city
for a few days.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.996
Now, chances are that Mari
will be back before supper.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.252
Still, it's wise of you
to call us, Dr. Collingwood.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.333
At least all our
phones are working.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.718
That's just great!

24:32.888 --> 24:36.928
We're a million miles from nowhere, too!
King car of the road!

24:37.101 --> 24:38.467
All right, what's the matter?

24:38.644 --> 24:39.885
It stopped!

24:41.313 --> 24:43.600
Hey, I think
I found the trouble.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.691
This thing pulled out,
and it's all covered with oil.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.398
Christ, didn't they teach you
nothing in reform school?

24:49.571 --> 24:51.233
Take it easy on him,
he's just a kid.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.275
I know, but when I was his age,
I could fix any car in two seconds.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.908
You schmuck.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.909
Hey, Krug,
where the hell are we?

25:00.082 --> 25:04.417
I just have the strangest feeling
we should be doing something more.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.999
Now, hold on,
Mrs. Collingwood.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.711
Now Harry, my deputy Harry,
he's down there in the radio car.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.967
He's calling
New York right now.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.845
And if we hear anything...
Here he is right now.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.767
What did
you hear, Harry?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.302
New York police say
they don't have anybody

25:22.479 --> 25:24.812
answering Mari's description
in jail or on ice.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.939
- Harry...
- It's their term.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.852
Guy in the morgue says
he hasn't had a kid on ice all day.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.021
First time in five years.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.523
Is that the last of the cake?

25:37.953 --> 25:41.117
There's a tool kit in the trunk.
I want you to start this goddamn car.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.790
Bitch! She bit me!

25:47.963 --> 25:50.250
Krug, this ain't getting us
out of the state.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.258
She bit me!
That bitch bit me!

25:54.011 --> 25:57.254
Weasel, we're
gonna have a little fun.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.388
- Krug.
- Car's on the blink, Weasel.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.514
No, Krug.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.095
As long as we got
you brats along...

26:02.269 --> 26:03.305
What are you gonna do?

26:03.479 --> 26:06.313
We ain't going to be able
to call a mechanic, go to a gas station,

26:06.482 --> 26:07.768
nothing.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.647
We'll get the phone company
hustling on the service

26:11.820 --> 26:13.231
so we can get a call from her.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.566
It'll be all right.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.481
You know, kids get
ants in their pants sometimes.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.321
She's just letting
off a little steam.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.328
Come on, there!

26:37.513 --> 26:39.505
Dig these crazy woods, man.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.053
Come on, Junior. Come on.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.686
Come on. Move it.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.270
Let's go to the right,
down by the water.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.730
All right.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.238
Who do
you suppose that is?

26:58.408 --> 26:59.694
I don't recognize it.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.610
Looks like someone got stuck.
Want to go out, have a look?

27:02.788 --> 27:06.031
No, no. Come on, let's go, kid.
We got more important things to do.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.167
That ain't going to find us
Mari Collingwood.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.879
Weasel, take out your knife.

27:22.307 --> 27:26.051
Now I'm gonna tell
this little lady here to do something.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.764
And if she doesn't do exactly
what I tell her to,

27:31.275 --> 27:33.062
I want you to cut her...

27:33.819 --> 27:35.685
I want you to cut her friend.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.729
Oh, brother!

27:37.906 --> 27:40.523
- Untie 'em. Untie 'em.
- Come on.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.451
- Hey.
- He's talking to you.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.832
Come here.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.828
Come here.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.586
Piss your pants.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.887
Piss your pants!

28:04.057 --> 28:06.674
I said, piss your pants.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.557
You sick mother...

28:12.941 --> 28:14.773
Phyllis, he cut me.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.026
Piss your pants.

28:19.615 --> 28:20.651
Do it!

28:21.366 --> 28:23.028
Watch her pee.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.655
She's doing it.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.613
Look at that!

28:32.002 --> 28:33.664
Oh, God! Hell!

28:33.837 --> 28:35.373
That's beautiful.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.295
Now, take 'em off.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.006
I said, take 'em off!

28:46.183 --> 28:47.765
You're so sick!

28:52.314 --> 28:54.931
Oh, yeah! Take 'em off!

28:55.108 --> 28:56.349
I told you about her.

28:56.526 --> 28:57.983
She's got lovely legs.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.442
This is really
a riot, man! I dig it!

29:01.615 --> 29:03.402
Take 'em off!
Take it all off.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.487
She got her
little panties all stained.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.278
Can we get Weasel
a pair of those pants?

29:08.455 --> 29:10.071
Do you want a pair
of those pants, Weasel?

29:10.874 --> 29:12.615
How about some with
a couple of hearts on them?

29:13.919 --> 29:16.286
She's got
a good-looking ass on her.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.671
Come on, we're going to play.
Up we go.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.126
Hit her.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.299
Hard!

29:22.469 --> 29:24.051
Sock it to her, baby.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.256
I said, hit her.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.178
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, Mari.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.843
Hit her in the stomach
with all your might.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.511
Stop it! Stop it!

29:33.689 --> 29:35.351
You're gonna kill someone
if you're not careful.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.514
What the hell
are you doing?

29:36.692 --> 29:37.773
Oh, shit!

29:37.943 --> 29:40.026
You guys got
to be crazy, man.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.857
If you're not careful,
you're gonna kill someone.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.862
Make them make
it with each other, man!

29:44.032 --> 29:45.864
That's a good idea!

29:46.034 --> 29:47.775
Make them make it
with each other.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.364
Too sick, man.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.744
Loosen her up a little bit.
Wait a minute.

29:53.917 --> 29:57.410
Oh, baby, don't... Come on, sweetheart.
Don't worry about it.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.250
You'll have plenty of time
to feel the pain.

30:00.424 --> 30:03.963
You know, Weasel here
is a specialist with a twist.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.215
Do it!

30:20.277 --> 30:21.859
Get it off!

30:22.571 --> 30:24.233
Leave her alone!

30:28.869 --> 30:30.235
Come on.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.413
- We got to do it.
- I can't.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.166
I can't.
I can't.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.540
I know, it's sick.
I know.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.717
It's okay. I know.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.263
It's sick.
But it's okay.

30:55.604 --> 30:59.939
It's just you and me here.
Nobody else. Just you and me, okay?

31:07.616 --> 31:08.652
Do it.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.744
It's okay.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.871
It's all right.
We're not going to hurt you.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.335
You already hurt her!

31:25.509 --> 31:27.842
What do you think
you're doing?

31:29.513 --> 31:32.130
No, Doc Collingwood,
still no word on Mari.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.594
But we'll let you know
just as soon as we hear something.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.894
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.100
Yes.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.811
Well, I'm glad you
got your phone fixed.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.600
Yeah, Doc, now you just
stick right by that phone

31:44.778 --> 31:45.894
'cause she might call,
you know.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.528
'I'm holding you
personally responsible.'

31:47.697 --> 31:48.653
Yes, sir.

31:48.824 --> 31:49.985
'Call me if anything comes up.'

31:50.158 --> 31:51.148
Yeah, okay.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.988
- 'Goodbye.'
- Bye.

31:56.206 --> 31:59.290
Hot damn, I wish I was
something else sometimes.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.042
You mean, like a duck or something?

32:05.090 --> 32:09.676
No, you damn fool! I mean something else
besides being a policeman.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.299
Doc Collingwood again, huh?

32:12.472 --> 32:14.088
Doc Collingwood.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.180
I bet she shacked up
with Wilbur Cranshaw.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.931
That shows how much you know,

32:20.105 --> 32:23.314
'cause Wilbur's gone up to Coopersburg
with Sweet Lily.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.519
Who the hell is Sweet Lily?

32:24.693 --> 32:26.650
Well, it's his pig.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.235
He went up to Coopersburg. He's gonna
enter her in some fair up there.

32:31.575 --> 32:34.067
Wilbur always was a little strange.

32:35.871 --> 32:38.955
I remember he left town
real sudden once before.

32:39.499 --> 32:42.708
Just before his collie came
down with a litter of pups.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.497
I'm going up to the car

32:48.675 --> 32:52.419
to see if I can find something
to cut some firewood with.

32:52.846 --> 32:53.836
Firewood?

32:54.014 --> 32:57.178
Yeah, you know, you know,
heat things up a little bit.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.176
Oh, yeah.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.897
You can handle things
while I'm gone, can't you?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.477
Oh, sure.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.912
Hey, listen, I'm really cold.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.913
Do you think it'd be okay
if I just put on my clothes?

33:22.083 --> 33:25.042
Just till Krug comes back.
I'm really cold.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.087
Okay?

33:29.382 --> 33:30.918
Sure. Go ahead.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.779
Listen,
I'm gonna make a run for it.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.616
When they go after me,
you go and get help, okay?

34:00.789 --> 34:01.745
Okay.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.156
Okay.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.335
You want to play? Junior!

34:09.547 --> 34:12.291
Watch that other girl.
Don't let nothing happen to her.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.599
I'm going to get you!

34:47.960 --> 34:50.829
Man, I got to
give up cigarettes.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.545
- Shut up!
- Junior? Is that your real name?

34:54.717 --> 34:55.833
I told you to shut up,
or I'll slap you silly.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.673
I'm gonna give you
another name.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.088
I'm gonna give you another name.
I'm gonna call you Willow.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.348
- Willow. Willow.
- Willow.

35:02.517 --> 35:06.227
Because you're kind of beautiful,
and you shake when the wind blows.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.513
- Krug is the wind.
- Let me alone.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.517
Krug's gonna really be
pissed off we lost her.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.936
Split up, okay?
Go that way.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.927
You bitch! Slow down!

35:48.229 --> 35:49.720
Willow, do you
have a girlfriend?

35:49.898 --> 35:53.016
Sure, I got lots of girlfriends
just waiting to get me.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.149
I don't think you do.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.935
No, you're right.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.978
I want to give
you something.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.146
I don't want that.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.441
- It's worth a lot. See?
- I don't want it.

36:01.618 --> 36:02.779
I want to be your friend.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.113
You want to get free.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.449
- I want to be your friend.
- Sadie, where'd she go?

36:06.623 --> 36:09.536
I want to be your friend.
I can get you a fix.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.578
Yeah.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.205
You can get me a fix?

36:15.382 --> 36:16.668
Yeah, you'd like that.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.924
- Yeah. I'd like it.
- Sadie! Over there!

36:19.094 --> 36:22.428
My father, he works with addicts.
He's got it in his house.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.634
It's here.
I can get you methadone.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.300
I can get you methadone,
just as quick as that.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.810
Really! Come on,
let's get out of here.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.845
- What, are you crazy?
- I live over there.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.766
I live across the street.
Come on, please!

36:34.943 --> 36:36.184
- I can't leave!
- Please.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.695
- Krug will kill me.
- No, not if you're not here.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.753
Screw, creep!

37:08.059 --> 37:09.925
Son of a bitch.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.351
'Attention all townships.
Attention all townships.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.640

Let me up.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.560
Come on!
There she is!

40:59.916 --> 41:01.532
I'm gonna kill that bitch.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.803
- Feel better now?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.135
How did she
get so close to the road?

41:59.308 --> 42:00.924
She threw
some dirt in my face.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.934
We caught her, though.
What are you worried about?

42:19.078 --> 42:21.035
Goddamn car stopped.

42:23.124 --> 42:25.616
You're out of gas, you idiot!

42:27.128 --> 42:28.790
Out of gas?

42:28.963 --> 42:30.420
God damn!

42:41.726 --> 42:43.934
See? I told you
she wasn't going far.

43:11.631 --> 43:13.839
How's your back, baby?

43:54.674 --> 43:57.963
- Phyllis! Phyllis!
- Oh, Christ.

44:00.096 --> 44:01.086
Junior!

44:01.264 --> 44:02.550
You said my
name was Willow.

44:02.723 --> 44:03.759
Willow, then!

44:03.933 --> 44:06.550
You've got to be a man
and do something for once.

44:06.727 --> 44:10.266
Mari, what would you do?
What would you do if you were me?

44:10.439 --> 44:11.600
Fuck!

44:15.111 --> 44:16.397
Phyllis!

44:38.259 --> 44:40.171
They're coming after us.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.478
Going somewhere?

44:58.863 --> 45:01.446
- Phyllis?
- Phyllis?

45:03.201 --> 45:04.442
Did she get away?

45:39.278 --> 45:42.567
- Take this, pigs!
- Get outta here. We hate cops!

45:43.407 --> 45:44.989
God damn!

45:49.789 --> 45:51.325
Damn hippies!

46:05.680 --> 46:08.889
"K-R-U-G."

46:09.058 --> 46:11.550
"Krug." That's really nice.

46:17.900 --> 46:18.981
Oh, yeah.

46:19.527 --> 46:23.111
You're gonna get yours.
You are really gonna get yours.

down to sleep

and get the suitcases.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.604
Let's get washed up
and the hell out of here.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.815
Yeah. Let's do that.

50:41.455 --> 50:45.620
Good grief, Frank. We've been
walking for nigh on an hour now.

50:46.835 --> 50:49.703
It's 7:00 and we've still got
a good 10 miles to go.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.373
If you got any better ideas, Harry,
you just come right out with them.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.794
'Cause I can't think of
any other way to get from here to there

50:56.971 --> 50:59.805
or any other place either,
without riding or walking.

50:59.974 --> 51:03.809
And since riding is out,
thanks to you, you lamebrain you,

51:03.978 --> 51:06.971
then walking is
the only thing that's left.

51:07.773 --> 51:08.980
Listen.

51:10.276 --> 51:11.767
What?

51:12.069 --> 51:13.230
I hear something.

51:14.780 --> 51:16.646
All I hear is you,
you damn fool.

51:20.160 --> 51:23.324
Who the hell do you
think you are? Tonto?

51:24.456 --> 51:25.992
It's a truck.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.371
And some chickens, too.

51:30.546 --> 51:31.878
Chickens?

51:32.965 --> 51:35.002
I only tell you
what the road tells me.

51:50.858 --> 51:53.851
Listen, Ada, we got a problem here.
This is serious business.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.691
Now we got to get to the Collingwood
place right away.

51:56.864 --> 52:00.778
Now, this is police business,
and this is an emergency, you hear?

52:01.368 --> 52:03.325
Can you help us out?

52:03.495 --> 52:04.702
Have to ride on the roof.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.030
On the roof?

52:07.207 --> 52:09.324
It's the only place
I have any room.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.593
Fasten your seatbelts!

52:25.059 --> 52:26.425
Proceed, Ada.

52:26.602 --> 52:29.595
Now, listen, Harry, if you tell any
of the boys at the lodge about this,

52:29.772 --> 52:30.979
I'm gonna fix your wagon.

52:35.694 --> 52:37.401
God Sam!

52:45.913 --> 52:47.404
What in thunder's
going on here, Ada?

52:47.581 --> 52:49.493
It's got its maximum load.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.535
I couldn't get another chicken on here
without it stalling.

52:52.711 --> 52:56.921
And now I got you two on here,
and you two ain't chickens!

52:57.091 --> 52:59.083
You mean this truck
won't start with us on it?

52:59.259 --> 53:00.841
You said it!

53:01.011 --> 53:03.253
Listen, Ada, you're gonna have to
take some of those chickens

53:03.430 --> 53:04.762
off that truck and let us on,
you hear?

53:04.932 --> 53:06.764
How much do you weigh, Deputy?

53:06.934 --> 53:08.641
185. Why?

53:08.811 --> 53:09.767
How much you weigh, Sheriff?

53:09.937 --> 53:12.099
- About 180.
- Bullshit.

53:12.272 --> 53:14.559
Well, maybe 190. I don't
weigh myself every morning.

53:14.733 --> 53:18.067
That's 11 crates of chickens.
And that ain't hay.

53:19.238 --> 53:23.232
Now look, Ada, you know I'm
a solemnly sworn officer of the law?

53:23.409 --> 53:25.617
Now, I got the law
on my side, Ada.

53:25.786 --> 53:29.575
And, Sheriff,
I got the chickens and the truck!

53:43.721 --> 53:46.134
Water! Water!

53:47.307 --> 53:49.299
You found water, chief.

53:55.941 --> 53:56.977
Still got
some in your eye.

53:57.151 --> 53:59.313
Yeah? You get it.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.941
How's that?
How's that?

54:05.325 --> 54:07.112
Did I get everything?

54:12.166 --> 54:13.782
- Am I clean?
- Help me out of here. Come on.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.621
- Am I clean?
- Yeah.

54:20.215 --> 54:21.626
Atta girl!

54:26.221 --> 54:28.304
Have a look, Sadie.
Is my tie okay?

54:28.474 --> 54:29.430
Beautiful, baby!

54:29.600 --> 54:30.681
Yeah.

54:31.643 --> 54:33.851
- Gee, thanks!
- You're welcome.

54:48.827 --> 54:51.035
- John!
- I'm in here!

54:54.374 --> 54:55.910
We've got guests.

54:56.919 --> 54:57.875
I'm sorry.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.707
Guests! Who is it?

55:01.924 --> 55:03.040
Get your foot
off the table!

55:03.217 --> 55:06.631
Being in this house
makes me wish I was a lady.

55:07.679 --> 55:10.717
This place is in the middle
of nowhere, you know that?

55:10.891 --> 55:13.224
What are you doing
with the Holy Bible?

55:13.393 --> 55:15.635
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here..."

55:27.199 --> 55:28.781
Hey, Weasel,
what are you doing?

55:28.951 --> 55:29.907
Nothing.

55:30.077 --> 55:33.912
Who in the world is it?
I didn't know anyone was coming over.

55:36.708 --> 55:40.918
John, I want you to meet
Harvey Wilson and his wife, Dorothy.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.829
- How are you?
- Sam Hardy.

55:43.006 --> 55:43.962
Sam.

55:44.132 --> 55:47.375
- And Dave Rizalski.
- David.

55:47.553 --> 55:50.512
Do you know their car broke down
right out front, John?

55:50.681 --> 55:53.173
Oh? Anything serious?

55:53.350 --> 55:55.842
- Yeah, I'm afraid we blew a rod.
- Oh, no.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.762
Well, Willie's Esso station
is the only garage I know,

55:58.939 --> 56:00.521
and they close at 6:00.

56:01.191 --> 56:02.773
Well, it wouldn't make
any difference anyway.

56:02.943 --> 56:04.024
The phone is still dead.

56:04.194 --> 56:06.561
They wanted us to drive them
to a motel, but I said

56:06.738 --> 56:07.728
that would be up to you...

56:07.906 --> 56:09.522
Mari still
has the car.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.282
It's all right,
we've got plenty of room.

56:11.451 --> 56:14.694
Absolutely. Why,
we have a perfectly good guest room.

56:14.872 --> 56:17.114
And, well, there's
Mari's room, I suppose.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.203
Are you sure we're not gonna
put you folks to any trouble?

56:19.376 --> 56:22.369
Nonsense! Our home is yours.
Let me get your bags.

56:22.546 --> 56:27.541
No, no, no! Frank here is younger.
He can handle it.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.878
Well, why don't I show you
to your rooms? Come on.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.091
Fine.

56:42.733 --> 56:46.397
Here, and through there. Okay?

56:46.862 --> 56:51.982
I'll put some towels in the bathroom for
you, and you can wash up if you like.

56:52.159 --> 56:53.400
Bacon and eggs
all right in the morning?

56:53.577 --> 56:54.567
- Thank you.
- That's marvelous.

56:54.745 --> 56:58.955
Okay, well, we'll be in the living room,
and you can join us if you like.

56:59.124 --> 57:01.332
Okay, just make
yourselves comfortable.

57:01.501 --> 57:02.992
Much obliged.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.594
Come on!

57:15.515 --> 57:18.098
Very nice.
Very nice.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.927
The lady of the house is nice, too.

57:21.104 --> 57:23.642
Hey, Krug, I want my fix, man.

57:23.815 --> 57:24.896
Go jump!

57:25.067 --> 57:26.854
- Krug?
- Yeah?

57:28.362 --> 57:29.853
Look at this.

57:31.823 --> 57:33.030
What?

57:36.161 --> 57:38.153
Guess who lives here?

57:42.292 --> 57:44.830
I wonder what
the odds are on that.

57:45.170 --> 57:46.377
Couldn't even tell you.

58:02.437 --> 58:05.555
Feel like playing
"Three Thirds of a Ghost" or something?

58:05.732 --> 58:09.351
How would you like me to put my boot
up your ass sideways?

58:12.155 --> 58:15.569
I'm sorry I don't have anything
better to offer you, but...

58:15.867 --> 58:17.950
It's been such a confusing day.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.907
Hell, you've got a lot to offer.

58:20.414 --> 58:22.747
I mean, this food is impeccable.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.364
Are you folks on vacation?

58:57.534 --> 59:00.277
No. We're sort of
on a business trip.

59:00.454 --> 59:02.366
What sort of
business are you in?

59:02.539 --> 59:04.326
- Plumbing.
- Insurance.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.949
Well, which is it?

59:08.003 --> 59:10.290
You see, we're actually in both.

59:10.547 --> 59:13.130
We sell insurance
to plumbing companies.

59:13.300 --> 59:16.919
You know, in case they steal
some toilets or something.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.085
Yeah.

59:25.771 --> 59:28.184
Junior.

59:30.650 --> 59:33.984
Stop it!

59:34.154 --> 59:34.985
Stop it!

59:35.155 --> 59:36.737
- Willow!
- Stop it!

59:36.907 --> 59:38.489
You're gonna kill someone.

59:41.244 --> 59:43.281
Willow.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.991
I'm sorry.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.876
You don't mind
if I smoke, do you?

59:51.463 --> 59:53.170
I'm sorry!

59:54.841 --> 59:56.833
I'm sorry!

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.097
Shut up, you little creep!
I should've killed you down at the lake!

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.225
Shut up!
You're worse than your goddamn mother!

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:11.765
You see, Dave upstairs, he lost
one of our biggest accounts last week.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.229
International
Bathtub and Sink.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:18.195
$500,000 account,
down the drain, so to speak.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:23.075
He kind of takes the blame on himself.
Hasn't got over it yet.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.702
Any more spaghetti left?

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.953
Goddamn high-class,
tight-ass freakos.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.798
All that goddamn silverware.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.877
Who do they think they are, anyway?

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.296
People in China eating with sticks,

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:47.217
and these creeps got 16 utensils
for every pea on the plate.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.970
Take it easy.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.435
It don't make no matter,
one way or the other.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.234
Where's that goddamn son of mine?

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:03.821
He's taking a piss, or something.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:06.528
Did you get him his fix?

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:09.079
Screw him.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.773
Is there
anything I can do in there?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.741
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.373
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.454
Let me call my husband.
He's a doctor.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.415
No, no, lady, please!

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.292
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.403
Easy. Easy does it.
You okay?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.454
What the hell
have you been doing?

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:33.159
Nothing.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:38.669
Look, man!
I got to have a fix!

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.663
After breakfast.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.905
- Hey, Krug.
- Yeah?

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.035
I want my fix, man.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:15.747
Look, man!
Cut it out!

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:18.079
- I got to have a fix!
- Screw off.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:22.463
Krug, we gotta get out of here!
If they find out we killed their kid...

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.000
You shut up,
or you'll wind up in the lake with her!

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.941
- Oh, God, John.
- Jesus Christ!

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:31.107
Isn't there anything
we can do for her?

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:32.900
- Nothing.
- John.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.952
She's dead.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.490
Oh, my baby!

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:41.412
Oh, baby.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.044
Oh, my baby!

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:55.548
Don't move.
Open your mouth, please.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.302
Don't move.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.151
Open your mouth, please.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.615
- Lights.
- Lights.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:21.499
- Chisel.
- Don't move. Chisel.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:23.830
Hammer.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.540
Hammer.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:27.455
Wider now.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:29.460
Wider.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:33.753
Don't move.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.073
No good.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.010
Hello.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.922
What are you
doing up so late?

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:42.089
Oh, uh...

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.558
I thought
I heard noises.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.355
But it was just a dog
in the garbage can outside.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.149
I got a little hungry.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:57.149
Thought I might
raid the icebox.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.360
Well, I must say, you...

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.285
You do look like a man
with a huge appetite.

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:06.322
I mean, all that spaghetti
tonight and everything.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.490
Yeah, that's true.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.168
Say, where's your husband?

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:14.330
I couldn't help noticing
that your room was empty.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.089
Oh, he's there.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:35.854
He somehow finds
me too hard to...

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.863
- Well, he's afraid of me.
- You're kidding.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.984
Oh, no, I only wish I was.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:46.779
I could make love to a looker like you
with my hands tied behind my back.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.665
Let's go over to the couch.

01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.828
No, no, no!
Not here.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.005
John might hear us
and come in.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.170
Why don't we go outside?

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:00.300
Outside?

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.881
Please.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.841
I want you.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.216
Let's go outside.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:12.930
You know, I've always dreamed
of a man who could take me easily.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.100
Almost like you said,

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.192
with your hands
tied behind your back.

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:25.701
Baby, believe me,
I can literally do that. I'm so super.

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:56.617
God damn it.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.789
Here.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.374
Tie me up.

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:03.168
No, I couldn't!

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:06.176
I thought it was just
some girlish fantasy.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.096
I know no man could do that.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.179
I said, tie me up.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.020
Well...

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:10.108
Okay, now you just unzip me,
and that's all I'll need you for.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.901
Okay.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:17.956
You got it caught.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.415
On your little thing!
How did I do that?

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.583
- Shall I just give it a little yank?
- No!

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.548
No, no, don't do that!
Just ease it down.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.345
Nice and easy.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:36.600
That's it.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.928
Poor little fellow.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:42.772
It's not little. You just scared it,
that's all. Just wait.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.635
If you don't watch it,
I'm gonna come.

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:23.355
Please come then,
sweetie.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:27.651
Don't you want me to do you
good and proper?

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:32.902
You can do both, can't you?

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.617
Hell, yeah!

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:38.779
I can come five or six times
if you want me to.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.667
You bitch.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.998
I think I'm gonna come.

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:51.420
Are you sure, my love?

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.424
Sweet mama!

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.588
Here I come!

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.324
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Shut up.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:24.788
Krug, it's Weasel!
What the hell has happened to him?

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.668
What's the trouble, Doc?

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.829
Shut your filthy mouth!

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:32.875
Now, take it easy, Doc.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:40.177
Put the lights on!

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.438
Son of a bitch.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.483
Boy.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.573
You can do better than that,
come on. Right here.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.958
Come on, come on, right here.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:12.456
Oh, boy, you're almost as good as Sadie.
Why don't you get something to help you?

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:16.343
Come on. Maybe one of the andirons
or something, you know.

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:19.508
Let's even up the odds.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:23.717
Who's this? Hello, there.
You remember me?

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.772
Come on, Doc.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.685
We're just playing games now.
We're just beginning.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:36.526
And what did you do with Weasel?
What did you do with him?

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.379
What's your name, little angel?

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:00.637
Mari. Mari.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:03.970
She was a lot tougher
than you were, Doc.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:06.851
She took a while to kill.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:08.887
She was really tough.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:11.057
We had a hard time with her.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.434
But you're just a pussy!

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:20.149
A real pussy.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:25.488
Come on now, Doc.
You can do better than that.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:28.164
Just a couple of more, Doc.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.877
Maybe one more for me.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.353
What the hell
are you doing?

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:52.310
Oh, you wanna kill me.

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:53.519
I'll do it.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:54.682
Okay, well,
let me help you.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:55.850
I really will.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:59.021
Now, I want you to hold the gun out,
just like that, see?

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:03.067
You see that little notch in the back?
That little bump in the front?

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:06.658
I want you to kind of get
them lined up. That's right.

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.414
You're not shaking that much.
I know you can aim the gun.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.666
Just get them lined up,
and pull the trigger.

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:12.997
No.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:15.207
Come on.
Pull the trigger.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:19.090
I'm gonna kill you, Krug.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.717
You always were a loser.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.718
Junior,

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.222
I wanna talk to you.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.509
Listen to Daddy. Come on.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:31.144
Now, I want you
to take the gun,

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:35.311
then I want you
to turn around

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:38.234
and I want you to
put it in your mouth

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:43.570
and I want you to
blow your brains out!

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.243
- No!
- No. Not at me.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:52.249
I want you to take the gun,
and I want you to put it in your mouth

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.080
and I want you
to blow your brains out!

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.209
No!

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:57.371
- Blow your brains out!
- No!

01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:58.413
Blow your...

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:48.463
Sorry, Krug.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.091
But I could only
find one shell.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.221
- You better get out of here!
- Sadie!

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.186
Get away from me!

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:09.211
You're not going
to get away from me!

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:21.856
Get off of me!

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.356
Let's just get it over with!

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:32.461
John! For God's sake, don't!
