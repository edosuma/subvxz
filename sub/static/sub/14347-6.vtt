WEBVTT

00:02.833 --> 00:05.134
Battalion 1-5
to 1-5 Alpha.

00:05.169 --> 00:06.266
Transmit a 10-75.

00:06.301 --> 00:08.000
Come on, will you,
for crying out loud?

00:08.035 --> 00:09.067
Get your stuff
on there.

00:17.134 --> 00:18.232
So, how many guys?

00:18.267 --> 00:19.668
Three. Got me outside the bar.

00:19.703 --> 00:20.633
You okay, kid?

00:20.668 --> 00:21.665
They do any damage?

00:21.700 --> 00:23.300
Come on.
They work on Wall Street.

00:23.335 --> 00:24.865
Worst they can give me
is a paper cut.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.100
And you're sure your wife's
boyfriend put 'em up to this?

00:27.135 --> 00:28.566
What do you think?
I'm sure.

00:28.601 --> 00:31.166
Want me to call my cousin Benny?
He'll take care of this guy.

00:31.201 --> 00:34.000
You're talking about Benny, the one
I met at the Christmas party, right?

00:34.035 --> 00:34.965
That's
my cousin Larry.

00:35.007 --> 00:36.739
- Oh, Larry, with the kids?
- Yeah, twins.

00:36.784 --> 00:39.303
Oh, wow, so I guess that in vitro
thing really worked for them.

00:39.369 --> 00:41.534
It depends how you look at it.
The kids are black.

00:41.569 --> 00:42.932
Oh. That's a problem.

00:42.967 --> 00:44.732
Yeah, the doctor
screwed up the sperm donors.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.916
He impregnated Larry's wife
with the wrong guy's man-juice.

00:46.970 --> 00:48.297
- Wow.
- "Man juice?"

00:48.334 --> 00:50.634
- We weren't talking to you.
- Are we all clear here?

00:50.669 --> 00:52.926
Yeah, Franco's upstairs.
He's bringing somebody down.

00:52.984 --> 00:53.602
Good.

00:53.652 --> 00:54.717
So you want me
to call Benny?

00:54.768 --> 00:55.732
Nah. You know what?

00:55.767 --> 00:57.167
I think I'm gonna
handle this myself.

00:57.202 --> 00:58.367
I'm gonna take
the high road.

00:58.402 --> 00:59.366
Ha. You?

00:59.401 --> 01:00.867
Okay, maybe not
the high road,

01:00.902 --> 01:02.551
but certainly not
the lowest road.

01:02.586 --> 01:04.200
Which is where
you normally travel.

01:04.236 --> 01:05.266
Hey, you kidding me?

01:05.301 --> 01:06.733
I drew up
the original maps.

01:06.768 --> 01:07.834
Excuse me.

01:07.869 --> 01:08.865
Hey, Chris.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.065
Gotta get a mask on her.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.534
She ate a lot of smoke.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.800
Easy, easy,
sweetheart.

01:14.835 --> 01:15.865
We're trying
to help you.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.134
We're trying to help you. Relax.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.032
Never get used
to it,

01:21.067 --> 01:23.000
seeing little ones
like this.

01:23.035 --> 01:24.701
You got any kids?

01:24.736 --> 01:26.367
Nah. Well, yeah.

01:26.402 --> 01:27.434
Almost.

01:32.234 --> 01:34.267
Check out
the local talent around here.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.599
Take a gander, boys.

01:35.634 --> 01:38.134
Man, they sure grow 'em big
in this neighborhood.

01:38.169 --> 01:40.634
How'd you like to try
to shimmy up those legs?

01:40.681 --> 01:42.620
You better wear
your hiking boots.

01:42.867 --> 01:44.299
Yep. It's a guy.

01:44.334 --> 01:46.334
- You're out of your mind.
- Look at the calves.

01:46.369 --> 01:47.965
I don't know, Tommy.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.401
She looks like
most of the women

01:49.436 --> 01:50.499
in my wife's family.

01:50.534 --> 01:52.566
No way in the world
that's a guy.

01:52.601 --> 01:54.633
I know what I'm
talking about, okay?

01:54.668 --> 01:57.900
When I was a probie, I worked in the
meat packing district on the west side.

01:57.935 --> 01:59.700
There's more than one reason
they call it that.

01:59.735 --> 02:01.099
One, you work down there
long enough,

02:01.134 --> 02:03.134
you can see a trannie coming
with your eyes closed.

02:03.169 --> 02:05.318
Two, I came out of the building
10 minutes ago,

02:05.353 --> 02:07.467
and I asked he/she/it
if he/she/it was okay,

02:07.502 --> 02:09.065
and he/she/it said, "I'm fine,"

02:09.100 --> 02:11.100
but it wasn't like
a young hot chick "I'm fine."

02:11.135 --> 02:12.665
More like a James Earl Jones
"I'm fine."

02:12.700 --> 02:15.100
- Maybe she's a heavy smoker.
- I still say that's a dame.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.267
- Hey. Come with me here.
- What? What?

02:17.302 --> 02:18.767
Watch. Garrity.

02:18.802 --> 02:19.932
Yeah.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.684
All right, don't turn around
now, okay,

02:21.719 --> 02:23.366
but there's a chick
on the sidewalk.

02:23.401 --> 02:25.634
She's been checking you out
the entire last half-hour.

02:25.669 --> 02:27.034
Nah. Play it cool,
play it cool.

02:27.069 --> 02:27.999
Side of the eyes.

02:28.034 --> 02:29.034
- Side of the--
- Got it.

02:29.069 --> 02:29.999
Yeah.

02:30.034 --> 02:31.700
- Huh?
- Well, she's kind of--

02:31.735 --> 02:32.798
She's kinda big.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.266
She's not big.

02:34.301 --> 02:36.668
She's, you know, athletic.
You ever bang an athletic chick?

02:37.967 --> 02:39.132
Well, not that athletic.

02:39.167 --> 02:40.566
You don't know
what you're missing.

02:40.601 --> 02:43.000
I tell you, every muscle in
that body: tight as a drum.

02:43.035 --> 02:44.299
Every muscle?

02:44.334 --> 02:46.299
If it wasn't for my wife,
my high blood pressure

02:46.334 --> 02:48.867
and decreased sex drive, I'd
be on that like white on rice.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.032
- Really? She was checking me out?
- Mm-hmm.

02:51.067 --> 02:53.067
Let me know if you're
not gonna make a move--

02:53.102 --> 02:54.132
No, I'm going right now.

02:54.167 --> 02:55.867
- All right.
- Ah, you lucky prick.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.765
What do you think?
Helmet on or off?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.800
Start with the helmet on,
get the authority thing going,

03:00.835 --> 03:03.167
and then, midway through,
take the helmet off.

03:03.202 --> 03:04.132
He's good.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.317
Make us proud, kid.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.426
- Thanks.
- Jesus.

03:06.461 --> 03:07.797
He's a nitwit.

03:07.832 --> 03:09.266
He's unbelievable.

03:09.301 --> 03:10.665
- Hey, Franco.
- Yeah?

03:10.700 --> 03:13.668
We got Garrity
hitting on a trannie.

03:13.703 --> 03:14.999
Oh, yeah.

03:15.034 --> 03:16.534
- What's eating him?
- Wait, wait.

03:16.569 --> 03:18.034
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

03:18.069 --> 03:20.533
Nice to meet you.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.234
- How'd you make out?
- Pretty good.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.965
Yeah? Marriage material?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.201
I dunno about marriage, but
I gotta date with her tonight.

03:26.236 --> 03:27.335
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.434
I have to go now.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.117
Where you going?

03:31.152 --> 03:32.134
What's his problem?

03:32.169 --> 03:33.466
He's jealous.

03:33.501 --> 03:36.867
So, uh, I'd like to be there
on that date tonight.

03:36.902 --> 03:38.366
It's gonna be some evening.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.902
Yeah, but, Garrity, you know what?
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.867
I think this is gonna
be a quick in-and-out.

03:42.902 --> 03:44.700
- Why's that?
- Well, take a look at her.

03:44.735 --> 03:45.967
She's way out
of your league.

03:46.002 --> 03:46.867
Way out.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.367
Don't think
I can close the deal?

03:51.402 --> 03:52.832
- Nah. Not a chance.
- No way. Come on.

03:52.867 --> 03:55.467
I got 20 that says you don't
even get to first base tonight.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.132
- First base?
- Yeah.

03:57.167 --> 03:59.217
Oh, Jesus. All right, fellas,
I'll take that action.

03:59.252 --> 04:01.267
And tomorrow morning,
I'll be taking your 20 bucks.

04:01.302 --> 04:02.432
I'm in.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.067
These are the moments
I live for, Tommy.

04:04.102 --> 04:05.401
I know, I know.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.568
Hey, Lou,
somebody here to see you.

04:56.603 --> 04:57.733
- Who is it?
- Some guy.

04:57.768 --> 04:58.798
Dr. Thompkins?

04:58.833 --> 05:01.601
Okay, yeah. Thanks, kid.

05:04.992 --> 05:06.736
- Oh, Lieutenant Shea?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:06.785 --> 05:08.034
Come over here.
Come walk with me.

05:08.069 --> 05:08.999
Come on.
Walk with me.

05:09.034 --> 05:10.501
- Where are we--
- Walk with me.

05:10.536 --> 05:11.965
Walk with me.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.199
So, listen, what's up?

05:14.234 --> 05:16.865
Uh, well,
at last we meet.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.234
Well, we've spoken
so many times over the phone.

05:19.269 --> 05:21.401
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, what are you doing here?

05:21.436 --> 05:23.534
- Well, I know you're busy--
- Very busy.

05:23.569 --> 05:24.732
Uh, but the thing is,

05:24.767 --> 05:27.634
when you told me
about the poetry you'd written,

05:27.669 --> 05:30.334
well, I couldn't get it
out of my mind.

05:30.369 --> 05:31.533
I mentioned it
in passing--

05:31.568 --> 05:33.568
I hope you don't mind--
to some of the members

05:33.603 --> 05:35.334
of my post-traumatic
stress group,

05:35.369 --> 05:36.733
and their eyes just lit up.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.099
Yeah,
that's great.

05:38.134 --> 05:39.665
Look, this is
a city-owned building,

05:39.700 --> 05:41.900
and technically you're not even
supposed to be here.

05:41.935 --> 05:43.166
Well, I'm sorry,

05:43.201 --> 05:46.601
but I thought maybe if
I came and asked you in person.

05:46.636 --> 05:49.102
You have no idea
how helpful it would be

05:49.137 --> 05:51.385
if you shared your poetry
with the group.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.634
I just don't think
it's gonna happen, doc.

05:53.669 --> 05:54.698
Why not?

05:54.733 --> 05:55.999
Is it stage fright?

05:56.034 --> 05:57.599
We can have someone
read it for you.

05:57.634 --> 05:59.334
No, it's just that
I showed it to someone,

05:59.369 --> 06:01.601
and they didn't think
it was any good.

06:01.636 --> 06:03.798
Well, criticism
can be difficult to hear.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.634
You may have interpreted it
in a different way

06:05.669 --> 06:06.965
than was intended.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.833
They said it was the worst shit
they'd ever read.

06:09.868 --> 06:10.999
Well, whoever said that

06:11.034 --> 06:13.534
was obviously an uncaring,
insensitive,

06:13.569 --> 06:15.000
damaging human being.

06:15.035 --> 06:17.100
It was my wife.

06:17.135 --> 06:18.434
Ah.

06:18.469 --> 06:19.698
So.

06:19.733 --> 06:21.867
What else you got?

06:23.934 --> 06:24.999
Hey. Sean in yet?

06:25.034 --> 06:26.199
No, I haven't
seen him yet.

06:26.234 --> 06:28.067
Although I do want to hear
about last night.

06:28.102 --> 06:30.166
- Yeah.
- Imagine the moment of truth

06:30.201 --> 06:33.132
when a guy puts his hand
down a girl's pants,

06:33.167 --> 06:36.234
and all of a sudden,
everything's coming up balls.

06:36.269 --> 06:38.234
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

06:38.269 --> 06:39.684
Just shut up and eat.

06:39.719 --> 06:41.065
What's with the bag?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.301
A gift from a girl.
I put her air conditioner in.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.134
- What the hell is it?
- Oh, a snow globe.

06:45.169 --> 06:46.467
You shake it, it snows inside.

06:46.502 --> 06:48.199
Yeah. Pretty gay.

06:48.234 --> 06:49.434
Yeah, well, she's a girl.

06:49.469 --> 06:50.599
You know what would be cool,

06:50.634 --> 06:52.733
if you could shake that thing,
make it snow outside.

06:52.768 --> 06:54.001
Yeah. Then you'd have to shovel.

06:54.036 --> 06:55.234
No, you don't need
that bullshit.

06:55.269 --> 06:56.533
Yeah, right.

06:56.568 --> 06:58.401
You're not taking your bag?

06:58.471 --> 06:59.797
No. I don't want it.

06:59.842 --> 07:01.976
Perfect. I got my daughter's
birthday coming up.

07:02.035 --> 07:03.484
Shopping problem solved.

07:03.519 --> 07:04.934
- It's your day, babe.
- Yup.

07:04.969 --> 07:06.765
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.668
I believe
a couple people in this room

07:08.703 --> 07:09.601
owe me 20 bucks.

07:11.568 --> 07:12.533
Really?

07:12.568 --> 07:13.751
Yeah. First base, gentlemen.

07:13.786 --> 07:14.934
Come on. Show me the money.

07:14.969 --> 07:16.166
You got to first base?

07:16.201 --> 07:17.767
You mean,
you actually kissed her?

07:17.802 --> 07:19.401
Yeah. Tongues and everything.

07:19.436 --> 07:20.399
Now, come on,
pay up.

07:20.434 --> 07:22.134
Is that it? Tongues, and what?

07:22.169 --> 07:23.232
Well, that was...

07:23.267 --> 07:25.267
She did let me
suck on her tits a little.

07:25.302 --> 07:27.501
Oh, blessed mother, save me.

07:27.536 --> 07:28.967
Look, kid...

07:30.401 --> 07:33.401
Tommy, you want to tell him
or should I?

07:33.436 --> 07:34.599
What? Tell me what?

07:34.634 --> 07:35.950
I think you'd better tell him.

07:35.985 --> 07:37.232
If I do, it'll come out puke.

07:37.267 --> 07:38.534
What?
What are you talking about?

07:38.569 --> 07:39.800
Well, the thing is,

07:39.835 --> 07:41.301
um, we, uh...

07:43.700 --> 07:45.267
We want to go double or nothing.

07:45.302 --> 07:46.499
- Oh, God.
- Why? Wait, wait.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.232
- What's the bet?
- Eighty bucks says

07:48.267 --> 07:50.134
you can't close the deal
before the weekend.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.399
You mean sleep with her?

07:51.434 --> 07:53.000
Full penetration
before the weekend.

07:53.035 --> 07:54.499
Yeah. I-- I don't know.

07:54.534 --> 07:56.367
What? I thought you had game,
big shot.

07:56.402 --> 07:57.767
I do. I got game, all right?

07:57.802 --> 07:58.965
- Yeah?
- I just--

07:59.000 --> 08:00.166
I don't wanna rush it, okay?

08:00.201 --> 08:02.000
There's just something
about this girl.

08:02.035 --> 08:03.800
She's-- I don't know.
She's different.

08:03.835 --> 08:05.199
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.467
It's like she understands
the way a man thinks, you know?

08:08.502 --> 08:09.633
Yeah, I'm sure she does.

08:09.668 --> 08:11.533
- No shit.
- Are we on, or what?

08:11.568 --> 08:13.399
All right, boys,
let it ride, okay?

08:13.434 --> 08:15.733
And, by the way,
I got a date with her tonight,

08:15.768 --> 08:16.698
so this little wager

08:16.733 --> 08:18.134
may be over sooner
than you think.

08:18.169 --> 08:20.599
Might be.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.765
I have supported
everything--

08:21.800 --> 08:23.201
everything she's ever
wanted to do!

08:23.236 --> 08:25.065
The water coloring
class,

08:25.100 --> 08:27.134
the compost pit
in the backyard,

08:27.169 --> 08:28.651
all of that crap.

08:28.686 --> 08:30.099
And the one time--

08:30.134 --> 08:33.633
the one time that I ask her
for some support...

08:33.668 --> 08:36.601
It sounds like you have
a lot of rage towards your wife.

08:36.635 --> 08:39.432
Yeah, well--
Uh-huh.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.400
You know, after she said that
about my poetry, I mean...

08:43.601 --> 08:44.501
we haven't, you know...

08:46.000 --> 08:47.865
We haven't had sex since.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.301
Not that we were having it
before, but...

08:51.601 --> 08:53.000
At least
I was making an effort.

08:53.035 --> 08:54.432
Well, this is another reason

08:54.467 --> 08:56.201
why I think
you should reconsider

08:56.236 --> 08:57.832
speaking to the group.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.965
I think it would be
very cathartic for you.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.334
I think it would help release
all that bad energy

09:02.369 --> 09:04.034
trapped inside you.

09:04.069 --> 09:04.967
Well...

09:06.134 --> 09:08.865
I got plenty of that.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.050
I think a positive response
to your writing

09:11.085 --> 09:13.201
may also help heal the rift
with your wife.

09:14.833 --> 09:15.867
You think?

09:22.067 --> 09:23.267
Hello. Family Services.

09:23.302 --> 09:24.432
No, she's not in right now.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.167
She'll be back
in a couple of hours.

09:26.202 --> 09:27.865
Okay.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.399
Can I help you?

09:29.434 --> 09:30.734
I don't know.
I hope so.

09:30.769 --> 09:31.999
A couple of days ago,

09:32.034 --> 09:34.334
I dropped off a kid,
um, a little girl,

09:34.369 --> 09:36.634
her name was Keela,
Keela Valenzuela.

09:36.669 --> 09:38.199
Okay.

09:38.234 --> 09:40.698
Um, is she still here?

09:40.733 --> 09:42.166
The children aren't housed here.

09:42.201 --> 09:44.134
These are the
administrative offices.

09:44.169 --> 09:45.566
Right. Right.

09:45.601 --> 09:47.967
Um, is she still available?

09:52.201 --> 09:53.568
She's been placed.

09:53.603 --> 09:55.199
Placed?

09:55.234 --> 09:57.100
Uh, I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

09:57.135 --> 09:58.967
She's been placed with a family.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.900
Oh.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.351
That's good. That's good.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.076
Um, who-- who are they?

10:06.111 --> 10:07.732
Do they live
around here?

10:07.767 --> 10:10.134
That information
is confidential.

10:10.169 --> 10:11.566
Right.

10:11.601 --> 10:14.034
You know, I just wanna make sure
she's okay, you know?

10:14.069 --> 10:16.533
Are they in the city?

10:16.568 --> 10:19.184
Sir, I cannot give you
that information.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.800
Just be happy
that she's been placed.

10:21.835 --> 10:22.865
I'm sorry.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.100
What--what was your name?

10:24.135 --> 10:25.399
Liz.

10:25.434 --> 10:27.601
Liz. Uh, Liz, I'm Franco.

10:27.636 --> 10:29.635
Nice to meet you.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.599
You know, Liz,

10:31.634 --> 10:33.065
if you just happened

10:33.100 --> 10:36.634
to leave your computer screen
unattended, just for a moment,

10:36.669 --> 10:39.266
and I just happened

10:39.301 --> 10:40.800
to check out
that computer screen

10:40.835 --> 10:42.401
as a fellow city employee...

10:44.067 --> 10:46.434
that could happen, right?

10:46.469 --> 10:47.800
It could...

10:49.034 --> 10:50.967
but it won't.

10:57.434 --> 10:58.501
Thank you.

11:05.306 --> 11:06.934
- Yeah?
- Hey, Tommy?

11:06.986 --> 11:08.168
- What's up?
- I need a favor.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.401
I'm trying to get some information

11:09.434 --> 11:10.826
from these people
at family services,

11:10.867 --> 11:12.668
but they won't help me.
Do you know anybody?

11:12.703 --> 11:14.168
No, my brother Johnny might,
though.

11:14.203 --> 11:15.852
He's connected all over.
I'll ask him.

11:15.887 --> 11:17.466
All right, yeah,
whatever you can do, man.

11:17.501 --> 11:20.900
Yeah, yeah. I'll call him right
now, all right? Later.

11:27.568 --> 11:28.717
- Hey.
- Yeah, hey.

11:28.752 --> 11:29.909
He just pulled up.

11:29.944 --> 11:31.032
I'll send the guys in.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.267
Make sure Janet
doesn't see you.

11:32.302 --> 11:34.199
I'm two blocks away.

11:34.234 --> 11:35.232
Really scare him,
Johnny.

11:35.267 --> 11:37.000
I want this guy
pissing his pants.

11:37.035 --> 11:38.733
Do I tell you
how to put fires out?

11:38.768 --> 11:39.698
Throw him in a cell

11:39.733 --> 11:40.798
with, like,
six other guys

11:40.833 --> 11:42.034
and tell them
he's a pedophile.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.751
Hello?

11:43.786 --> 11:45.399
Ah, prick.

11:45.434 --> 11:47.833
Prick doesn't think I know
how to make a guy piss himself?

11:47.868 --> 11:49.167
Jesus Christ.

11:49.202 --> 11:50.432
All right,

11:50.467 --> 11:51.798
green light, fellows.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.383
Go easy if he resists. No guns.

11:53.418 --> 11:54.934
My brother's kids are in there.

11:57.401 --> 11:59.434
Okay, here we go.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.467
Showtime.

12:03.601 --> 12:04.798
Roger?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.733
Yeah. I got it, babe.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.932
Can I help you guys?

12:15.967 --> 12:18.267
NYPD.
We're looking for Roger Mills.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.918
Well, I'm Roger Mills.

12:19.953 --> 12:21.376
Is there a problem?

12:21.411 --> 12:22.765
What's going on?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.301
There's a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

12:24.336 --> 12:25.366
Please step outside.

12:25.401 --> 12:27.000
Can you put
the wine down, sir,

12:27.035 --> 12:29.999
and please
step outside?

12:30.034 --> 12:31.399
You don't need to cuff me--

12:31.434 --> 12:32.798
Sir, it's procedure. I have to.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.434
Could you please
be gentler with him?

12:36.501 --> 12:39.166
You crafty bastard.

12:39.201 --> 12:40.798
Yeah,
even I'm impressed.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.550
...for assault, sir.
You shouldn't hit a man--

12:42.585 --> 12:44.267
See you in cell
block six, asshole.

12:44.302 --> 12:45.732
You know,
this reminds me

12:45.767 --> 12:47.267
of Sister Mary Gregory
back in school.

12:47.294 --> 12:49.230
You remember what
she always used to say?

12:49.278 --> 12:51.632
"Revenge is the poor delight
of little minds."

12:51.685 --> 12:54.534
You're gonna throw
Sister Mary Gregory at me

12:54.569 --> 12:55.999
at this point?

12:56.034 --> 12:59.100
Hey, no, I'm just saying
two wrongs don't make a right.

12:59.135 --> 13:01.067
Hey, this stuff's in the Bible.

13:01.102 --> 13:02.368
What's in the Bible?

13:02.403 --> 13:03.599
"Thou shalt have

13:03.634 --> 13:06.434
your ex-wife's boyfriend
falsely arrested?"

13:06.469 --> 13:07.832
No, Exodus, asshole, okay?

13:07.867 --> 13:09.467
"Eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth."

13:09.502 --> 13:10.466
Come on.

13:10.501 --> 13:11.901
Like you know the Bible?

13:11.936 --> 13:13.266
I know the parts I can use.

13:13.301 --> 13:15.867
Well, how about this?
"You shall reap what you sow."

13:15.902 --> 13:16.867
Meaning?

13:16.902 --> 13:17.833
Meaning...

13:18.867 --> 13:20.599
just be careful.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.134
Oh! Here comes Janet.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.599
Time for phase two

13:23.634 --> 13:24.899
of my secret evil plan.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.599
You know, this is really sad.

13:26.634 --> 13:28.634
If Sister Mary Gregory
were here, she'd vomit.

13:28.669 --> 13:30.634
Okay, by the way,
if Sister Mary Gregory was here,

13:30.669 --> 13:32.266
she'd be, like,
120 years old.

13:32.301 --> 13:35.000
Scratch that. I think she was
120 when we were in school.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.501
She'd be, like, 150.
Now, get lost.

13:36.536 --> 13:37.732
It's open.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.099
You ought to be ashamed.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.767
You know what?
Just get out of here.

13:40.802 --> 13:42.634
- What?
- Huh? Hey.

13:42.669 --> 13:44.432
Uh, what's going on?

13:44.467 --> 13:45.668
What? You did get beat up?

13:45.708 --> 13:48.178
Yeah. Yeah. What's with
all the commotion, noise?

13:48.236 --> 13:49.832
They just arrested Roger.

13:49.885 --> 13:51.584
They said something
about him assaulting you?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.841
- Roger was involved?
- Involved with what?

13:53.900 --> 13:56.267
These three guys jumped me
outside a bar the other night,

13:56.310 --> 13:58.080
and one of the guys
mentioned Roger's name.

13:58.119 --> 13:59.925
I just thought it was
kind of strange, but, wow.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.168
He said that?

14:01.203 --> 14:02.332
Pretty much.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.000
No, no, no.
You don't know Roger, Tommy.

14:04.035 --> 14:05.634
He would never
do something like that,

14:05.669 --> 14:07.032
not in a million years.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.067
Why do people say that?
"Not in a million years."

14:09.102 --> 14:10.668
It's not like
we have a million years

14:10.703 --> 14:11.932
to find out for sure.

14:11.967 --> 14:14.034
So why didn't you
tell me that sooner?

14:14.069 --> 14:15.432
Because, you know,

14:15.467 --> 14:19.032
we have the stuff
with Colleen and us,

14:19.067 --> 14:21.434
and I just didn't
wanna stress you out, you know?

14:21.469 --> 14:23.668
Oh, that's real sweet, Tom.

14:23.703 --> 14:25.832
Look, if you did
get beat up--

14:25.867 --> 14:28.367
assuming that you didn't
beat yourself up--

14:28.402 --> 14:29.932
I am sorry,

14:29.967 --> 14:33.100
but I am sure that Roger
had nothing to do with this.

14:33.135 --> 14:34.266
I don't know Roger
well enough.

14:34.301 --> 14:35.900
I only talked to him
a couple times.

14:35.935 --> 14:37.166
Seemed like a nice guy.

14:37.201 --> 14:39.201
I hope he didn't have anything
to do with it.

14:39.236 --> 14:40.234
That'd be a little ugly.

14:40.269 --> 14:41.199
Yeah.

14:41.234 --> 14:42.665
Where you going?

14:42.700 --> 14:44.499
To help Roger. And, Tommy...

14:44.534 --> 14:46.967
if I find out this is just
more of your bullshit,

14:47.002 --> 14:48.299
- so help me--
- It's not bullshit.

14:48.334 --> 14:50.700
I will beat you up worse
than three guys ever could.

14:50.735 --> 14:51.698
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.434
"Yeah, yeah, yeah" yourself.

14:54.434 --> 14:55.665
So, uh,
that go as well

14:55.700 --> 14:57.366
as you hoped it would,
tough guy?

14:57.401 --> 14:59.900
It's all a part of
my secret evil plan, pal.

14:59.935 --> 15:02.867
Just watch.
Sit back and watch.

15:11.501 --> 15:13.332
That

15:13.367 --> 15:14.434
was nice.

15:14.469 --> 15:16.534
Mm.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.401
I actually thought
the third time was better,

15:20.436 --> 15:23.034
but I'm not gonna argue
with you.

15:23.069 --> 15:25.732
Remember last week

15:25.767 --> 15:27.800
when you said
you loved me?

15:27.835 --> 15:29.668
Did you really
mean that,

15:29.703 --> 15:31.466
or was it
just one of those

15:31.501 --> 15:33.767
"caught up in
the moment" things?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.999
Uh, well, I-- You know,

15:36.034 --> 15:39.000
I was caught up
in the moment, yeah, but--

15:39.035 --> 15:40.166
You know--

15:40.201 --> 15:41.134
No, wait. Wait.

15:42.634 --> 15:44.232
What?

15:44.267 --> 15:45.832
I, you know--
I wasn't kidding.

15:45.867 --> 15:47.467
I mean, obviously,
you know, I said it.

15:47.502 --> 15:49.267
I meant it
when I said it.

15:49.302 --> 15:50.332
Well,
if you love me,

15:50.367 --> 15:52.900
how come you never
bring me anything?

15:54.201 --> 15:55.234
What?
Bring you what?

15:55.269 --> 15:56.435
What do you want?

15:56.470 --> 15:57.566
Just anything.

15:57.601 --> 15:59.266
A card, flowers,
just something

15:59.301 --> 16:01.017
that shows
you're thinking about me.

16:01.052 --> 16:02.733
I'm thinking about you
all the time.

16:02.768 --> 16:03.951
What are you
talking about?

16:03.986 --> 16:05.426
Yeah, at 2:00
in the morning

16:05.461 --> 16:06.832
when you want
to get off.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.967
Tonight I called you.
It was, like, 20 to 10.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.668
I'm starting
to feel cheap, Tommy.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.501
You come here,
you bang me,

16:12.536 --> 16:13.765
you leave.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.467
It's not
very romantic.

16:15.502 --> 16:17.099
Okay, you know what?

16:17.134 --> 16:18.901
I did-- I did get you something,

16:18.936 --> 16:20.668
and it was gonna be
a big surprise

16:20.724 --> 16:22.581
- for our anniversary.
- You did?

16:22.678 --> 16:23.281
Yeah.

16:23.334 --> 16:25.067
Wow. You remember
the day we met?

16:25.102 --> 16:26.800
Hey, I never forget
stuff like that.

16:26.835 --> 16:27.999
Oh, that
is so sweet.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.299
Most men would never
remember that.

16:30.334 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, well, you're not
with most men, baby.

16:33.035 --> 16:36.234
Well, can I have
my present now?

16:36.269 --> 16:37.534
Like, right now?

16:37.569 --> 16:38.401
Mm-hmm.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.867
I mean, it's down in the truck.

16:43.034 --> 16:44.900
Please?

16:46.475 --> 16:49.218
- Yeah?
- Hey, son. It's me.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.988
Dad, what's up?
Why are you whispering?

16:51.069 --> 16:52.668
Never mind,
never mind that.

16:52.703 --> 16:54.251
I got
a quick question.

16:54.286 --> 16:55.800
You ever do mushrooms?

16:55.835 --> 16:56.765
What?

16:56.800 --> 16:57.899
Mushrooms.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.534
Not the ones
you put in a salad.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.132
The drug ones.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.434
Wait, you mean, like,
psychedelic mushrooms?

17:03.469 --> 17:04.934
Yeah, yeah.
You done 'em?

17:04.969 --> 17:06.499
No. Why?

17:06.534 --> 17:07.964
Teddy got his hands
on some.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.117
Now he wants us
to do them together.

17:10.152 --> 17:12.199
Now, I don't like
regular mushrooms,

17:12.233 --> 17:15.201
so my gut's telling me
not to get involved.

17:15.236 --> 17:16.165
What do you think?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.467
You know what?
Go with your gut.

17:18.501 --> 17:19.851
You okay?

17:19.886 --> 17:21.165
Yeah. Why?

17:21.201 --> 17:22.665
Well, you know, the whispering

17:22.700 --> 17:25.000
and you, quite frankly,
sound a little tired.

17:25.035 --> 17:26.566
Well, I won't
lie to you, son.

17:26.601 --> 17:29.199
It isn't easy keeping up
with your Uncle Teddy.

17:29.234 --> 17:32.334
We just got back from three days
up at the Indian casino,

17:32.369 --> 17:34.001
that Foxwood place?

17:34.036 --> 17:35.634
Teddy dropped...

17:36.534 --> 17:37.865
Ten grand.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.700
You're kidding me.
He has that kind of money?

17:39.735 --> 17:41.234
No, not anymore he doesn't.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.533
Jesus.

17:42.568 --> 17:44.417
How's your mother doing?

17:44.452 --> 17:46.267
She's all right, you know?

17:46.302 --> 17:47.468
Look, I gotta go.

17:47.503 --> 17:48.599
Nice talking to you.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.568
Call your mother.
Oh, shit.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.865
Oh, my God.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.000
Tommy, how did you know
I loved snow globes?

17:57.035 --> 17:58.199
Did I tell you?

17:58.234 --> 18:01.034
What can I say, baby?
I'm just a listener.

18:01.069 --> 18:02.568
It's adorable.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.935
Thank you.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.267
Happy?

18:07.733 --> 18:10.100
I feel like you know
so much about me,

18:10.135 --> 18:11.732
and all I know is your name.

18:11.767 --> 18:14.534
Well, sweetheart, I mean,
a name can mean a lot.

18:14.569 --> 18:16.634
Imagine if
you didn't even know that.

18:16.669 --> 18:18.535
Yeah, but we're
supposedly in love,

18:18.570 --> 18:20.401
and I've never even
been to your house.

18:20.436 --> 18:21.932
Mm. Someday.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.732
How about tomorrow night?

18:23.767 --> 18:26.134
Uh, I'm pretty sure
I'm working tomorrow night.

18:26.169 --> 18:27.366
Uh, yeah, definitely.

18:27.401 --> 18:29.566
I'm definitely working
tomorrow night.

18:29.601 --> 18:32.601
I'll give you something
I've been holding out on.

18:32.636 --> 18:33.765
Like what?

18:33.800 --> 18:36.767
You know, that thing
I said I don't like?

18:36.802 --> 18:39.334
I'll let you do it.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.934
Oh, really?

18:40.969 --> 18:42.299
Yeah.

18:42.334 --> 18:43.932
Well, I might be able

18:43.967 --> 18:45.934
to find somebody
to cover for me.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.733
Hi.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.383
No?
Still not talking, huh?

18:58.418 --> 19:00.459
I want to see my lawyer.

19:00.494 --> 19:02.466
You guys can't keep me here

19:02.501 --> 19:04.001
unless you charge me
with a crime.

19:04.036 --> 19:05.668
It's against the law,
and you know it.

19:05.703 --> 19:07.301
You know what else
is against the law?

19:07.336 --> 19:08.399
Huh?

19:08.434 --> 19:11.133
Conspiracy
to commit manslaughter.

19:11.168 --> 19:13.418
I didn't conspire
to commit anything.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.668
That's not
what your three pals said.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.832
What did they say?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.199
Well, according
to their statements,

19:21.234 --> 19:23.234
you hired them to
kick Tommy Gavin's ass.

19:23.269 --> 19:24.965
I did not hire them.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.067
They're just guys
from the office.

19:28.102 --> 19:29.732
They're friends.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.533
Look,
I told them about Tommy

19:31.568 --> 19:33.367
and about the things
that Tommy did to me.

19:33.402 --> 19:36.334
They took it
upon themselves to--

19:36.369 --> 19:37.798
Look, I never--

19:37.833 --> 19:39.067
I did not hire them.

19:39.102 --> 19:40.299
I swear.

19:40.334 --> 19:41.967
It's okay, man. Relax.

19:43.501 --> 19:45.900
You know, so you go
to jail, right?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.199
What's three,
four, six months

19:48.234 --> 19:49.833
when you're looking
at the big picture, huh?

19:49.868 --> 19:51.367
It's okay.

19:52.934 --> 19:54.401
Hey, you still
hungry?

19:54.436 --> 19:56.301
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

19:56.336 --> 19:57.299
Yeah?

19:57.334 --> 19:59.017
You want something to eat?

19:59.052 --> 20:00.700
Yeah, that would be nice.

20:00.735 --> 20:01.700
Start 'fessing up.

20:07.201 --> 20:09.166
Hey, Johnny.

20:09.201 --> 20:10.534
Hey, Janet.
What's up?

20:10.569 --> 20:11.818
How you doing, honey?

20:11.853 --> 20:13.060
Hey. I'm good.
How are you?

20:13.107 --> 20:15.700
- How are Jeannie and the kids?
- They're good. Thanks for asking.

20:15.749 --> 20:17.577
Listen, my friend Roger Mills
is inside.

20:17.618 --> 20:19.700
Yeah, I got him
in the back right now.

20:19.735 --> 20:20.732
It's not looking so hot.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.250
Okay, what exactly
is going on here?

20:22.285 --> 20:23.698
It looks like
your friend Roger,

20:23.733 --> 20:25.568
he got three of his buddies
to attack Tommy.

20:25.603 --> 20:26.832
Yeah, I'm sorry, Johnny,

20:26.867 --> 20:28.301
but this smells
like bullshit to me.

20:28.336 --> 20:29.432
Tommy gets attacked--

20:29.467 --> 20:30.798
not that I even believe that--

20:30.833 --> 20:32.833
and then somehow
the case winds up on your desk?

20:32.871 --> 20:35.588
- Pretty convenient, don't you think?
- What are you hinting at, Jan?

20:35.634 --> 20:38.267
I'm not hinting at anything.
I'm saying it's bullshit.

20:38.302 --> 20:40.234
I'll be honest with you.
This wasn't my case.

20:40.279 --> 20:41.854
This is my brother
we're talking about.

20:41.899 --> 20:44.440
I'm just supposed to sit by
and not get involved?

20:44.502 --> 20:45.533
That would be bullshit.

20:45.568 --> 20:47.167
And as for your little
girlfriend in there,

20:47.202 --> 20:48.601
he's this close to confessing.

20:48.636 --> 20:49.851
Got it?

20:49.886 --> 20:51.032
Really?

20:51.067 --> 20:52.067
Yeah, really.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.633
Look, you know,
not for nothing, Jan,

20:55.668 --> 20:57.499
but between this chump
and my brother,

20:57.534 --> 20:59.568
you're batting about a thousand
in the guy department.

20:59.603 --> 21:01.452
You know, if you want
to talk to him.

21:01.487 --> 21:03.301
I'll set it up.
Couple minutes, tops.

21:03.336 --> 21:04.266
No.

21:04.301 --> 21:05.366
You sure?

21:05.401 --> 21:06.401
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

21:06.436 --> 21:07.366
Yeah.

21:07.401 --> 21:08.733
Take care, Janet.

21:14.401 --> 21:15.867
Hey, guys.

21:15.902 --> 21:17.334
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:17.369 --> 21:18.299
Hi.

21:18.334 --> 21:19.367
What's going on?

21:19.402 --> 21:20.432
Nothing.

21:20.467 --> 21:23.733
Katy failed her spelling test.

21:23.768 --> 21:24.899
I studied real hard.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.234
Yeah, you know what,
sweetheart?

21:26.269 --> 21:27.534
I failed a lot of tests
growing up,

21:27.569 --> 21:29.332
and look at me, right?

21:29.367 --> 21:31.434
And why are you ratting
your sister out like that?

21:31.469 --> 21:32.967
What kind of brother
is that?

21:33.002 --> 21:34.867
No Gameboy for a week.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.034
But, Dad--

21:36.069 --> 21:37.132
No Gameboy.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.366
Can we get a dog?

21:39.401 --> 21:41.798
You gotta work on your timing.
No, we're not getting a dog.

21:41.833 --> 21:45.434
Colleen, take these two upstairs, get
them ready. I need to talk to your dad.

21:45.469 --> 21:46.833
Is it about Roger
being arrested?

21:46.868 --> 21:47.865
Uh-uh-uh.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.600
Innocent till proven guilty.

21:49.635 --> 21:50.968
I never said he was guilty.

21:51.003 --> 21:52.266
But you were going there.

21:52.301 --> 21:53.700
We don't do that
in this family.

21:53.735 --> 21:54.832
What do you care?

21:54.867 --> 21:56.100
I thought you hated him.

21:56.135 --> 21:57.299
No, I don't hate him.

21:57.334 --> 21:59.134
We have our differences,
but I don't hate him.

21:59.169 --> 22:00.235
I don't hate anybody.

22:00.270 --> 22:01.266
Not even the three guys

22:01.301 --> 22:02.899
who tried to kill me
the other night.

22:02.934 --> 22:04.967
I hope he stays in jail.
He creeps me out.

22:05.002 --> 22:05.932
All right, let's go.

22:05.967 --> 22:07.534
Come on, pinky.
Let's go.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.301
Tommy, I don't know what to say.

22:13.336 --> 22:16.278
I mean, the idea that Roger could
actually do something like this--

22:16.352 --> 22:18.059
Look, you know what?
You think you know people.

22:18.094 --> 22:19.767
You think they're normal,
civilized people,

22:19.802 --> 22:21.299
and next thing
you know,

22:21.334 --> 22:24.034
you find out they're evil,
dark, godless pricks.

22:24.069 --> 22:25.501
Not that I'm saying
Roger's a prick.

22:26.767 --> 22:28.668
So, what's gonna happen to him?

22:28.703 --> 22:29.832
Ball's in my court.

22:29.867 --> 22:31.668
I gotta figure out
if I wanna press charges.

22:31.703 --> 22:33.032
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

22:33.067 --> 22:35.167
I don't think
I'm gonna press charges.

22:35.202 --> 22:36.132
You sure?

22:36.167 --> 22:37.434
I don't need that, you know?

22:37.469 --> 22:38.633
We don't need that.

22:38.668 --> 22:39.832
But you're the one he hurt.

22:39.867 --> 22:41.283
So you should do
whatever you want.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.700
It's not like I'll let
that bastard

22:42.735 --> 22:44.217
come around here anymore.

22:44.252 --> 22:46.343
I'm gonna let him go.

22:46.378 --> 22:48.456
I am really sorry.

22:48.491 --> 22:50.534
It's not your fault.

22:58.234 --> 23:00.467
Yo, Tommy, what's up
with you, man?

23:00.502 --> 23:01.566
You've been up all day.

23:01.593 --> 23:03.816
They repeal the tax
on cigarettes or something?

23:03.850 --> 23:06.199
Actually, I wouldn't mind paying
the extra nine-and-a-half bucks

23:06.245 --> 23:07.887
a pack today,
because life is beautiful.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.067
Oh, I'm glad
to hear it.

23:09.102 --> 23:10.599
That reminds me.

23:10.634 --> 23:13.934
This, my friend, is the number
for Family Services.

23:13.969 --> 23:15.032
That guy, you call him,

23:15.067 --> 23:16.668
tell him Johnny Gavin
told you to call.

23:16.703 --> 23:17.985
He should be able
to take care

23:18.020 --> 23:19.267
of everything you need,
all right?

23:19.302 --> 23:21.032
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.533
You know, you really
should just let her go.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.301
I'm just trying to make sure
everything's okay, Tommy.

23:26.336 --> 23:27.599
Yeah.

23:27.634 --> 23:30.401
And if it ain't?
You're gonna make it better?

23:33.401 --> 23:34.767
See you.

23:41.034 --> 23:42.501
Hey, what
are you doing?

23:42.536 --> 23:43.552
What do you mean?

23:43.587 --> 23:44.760
Wanna grab a beer?

23:44.795 --> 23:45.899
No, I got plans.

23:45.934 --> 23:47.567
We'll just grab
a couple beers.

23:47.602 --> 23:49.167
No, I got plans,
Tommy, okay?

23:49.202 --> 23:50.734
Why do I have to
elaborate, okay?

23:50.769 --> 23:52.232
I don't have to
answer to you.

23:52.267 --> 23:54.568
- I'm not asking you to--
- Jesus. Well, don't, then, okay?

23:54.603 --> 23:56.867
It's like the Spanish
Inquisition around here.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.032
I don't necessarily see that.

23:59.067 --> 24:00.900
Of course, I'm not
a religious person,

24:00.935 --> 24:03.084
so I wouldn't be
persecuted by it.

24:03.119 --> 24:04.826
Other things, yeah,
but not that.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.534
Hey, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

24:06.569 --> 24:07.599
Hey.

24:07.634 --> 24:09.117
How's it going
with your little vixen?

24:09.152 --> 24:10.601
It's going good.
I'm seeing her tonight.

24:10.636 --> 24:12.435
You better hurry up on that bet.

24:12.470 --> 24:14.199
Well, it's not like
I ain't trying.

24:14.234 --> 24:16.267
We start making out,
it gets all hot and heavy.

24:16.302 --> 24:17.867
I go to reach
a hand down there?

24:17.902 --> 24:18.899
She gets all skittish.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.698
- Go figure.
- Tell you what, though.

24:20.733 --> 24:22.534
Last night, she gave me
the best blow job

24:22.569 --> 24:24.134
I have ever had
in my entire life.

24:24.169 --> 24:25.299
Oh, God.

24:25.334 --> 24:27.134
Something she was doing
with her mouth. Wow.

24:27.169 --> 24:28.934
I don't know what it was,
but it was wet.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.051
What's wrong?

24:30.086 --> 24:31.099
You okay?

24:31.134 --> 24:33.767
He had a bad sandwich
this afternoon.

24:33.802 --> 24:34.732
Really?

24:34.767 --> 24:36.300
- Yeah.
- You sure?

24:36.335 --> 24:37.601
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:37.636 --> 24:38.867
Hey, wish me luck.

24:38.902 --> 24:40.234
Good luck.

24:42.134 --> 24:45.432
And so, without further ado,

24:45.467 --> 24:48.567
I would like
to turn the room over

24:48.602 --> 24:51.668
to Lieutenant Kenny Shea,
Engine 62.

24:53.267 --> 24:55.132
I'm, uh,

24:55.167 --> 24:58.000
just gonna sit here
if that's okay.

24:58.035 --> 25:00.067
How you doing, everybody?

25:01.467 --> 25:03.865
Good.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.267
As, um, Dr. Thompson told you--

25:07.302 --> 25:09.184
It's Thompkins.

25:09.219 --> 25:11.032
Sorry. Um--

25:11.067 --> 25:13.299
Like the doc said,

25:13.334 --> 25:18.167
I was at the Towers that day
with my crew.

25:18.202 --> 25:19.401
We lost four men...

25:20.800 --> 25:22.232
And, uh,

25:22.267 --> 25:23.467
ever since then...

25:26.767 --> 25:29.267
You know what, I think
I'm just gonna read my stuff

25:29.302 --> 25:32.334
and let it
kind of do the talking for me.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.668
The first poem is called
"When Hell Came."

25:37.703 --> 25:39.700
"The sky was blue
and crystal clear

25:39.735 --> 25:41.232
"when hell came.

25:41.267 --> 25:42.765
"The morning just begun,

25:42.800 --> 25:46.833
"but then came smoke
and ash and fire,

25:46.868 --> 25:48.367
all blocking out the sun."

25:51.534 --> 25:52.865
Surprise.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.534
I know what
you're thinking--

25:55.601 --> 25:57.067
How did she find me?

25:57.102 --> 25:58.266
Yeah.

25:58.301 --> 25:59.798
Don't be mad.

25:59.833 --> 26:02.034
I followed you home last night.

26:02.069 --> 26:03.199
What?

26:03.234 --> 26:05.100
I'm, like,
your own personal stalker.

26:06.867 --> 26:10.534
Oh, Tommy, I love this place.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.000
It's so cozy.

26:12.035 --> 26:12.999
Yeah.

26:13.034 --> 26:15.132
Where's your bedroom?

26:15.167 --> 26:17.967
How long did it take me
to ask that?

26:18.002 --> 26:20.367
- It's, uh--
- Listen.

26:20.402 --> 26:22.266
I want you

26:22.301 --> 26:24.700
to pour me a nice,

26:24.735 --> 26:26.601
cold beer...

26:27.733 --> 26:30.216
'cause I'm
really thirsty

26:30.251 --> 26:32.592
and I'm gonna
go upstairs,

26:32.627 --> 26:34.934
and I'm gonna
count to 60

26:35.800 --> 26:37.566
And when I'm done,

26:37.601 --> 26:41.001
I want you to be
tearing my clothes off

26:41.036 --> 26:44.401
or there's gonna be
big trouble, mister.

26:48.167 --> 26:49.601
Okay. Cold beer.

26:50.867 --> 26:52.601
Maybe this whole
stalker thing's

26:52.636 --> 26:54.201
really gonna work out.

26:54.236 --> 26:56.601
Sixty seconds.

26:58.234 --> 26:59.734
Oh, shit. Wow.

26:59.769 --> 27:01.185
Hey.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.566
Hey--

27:02.601 --> 27:03.566
Oh, sorry.

27:03.601 --> 27:05.250
I shouldn't barge in like this.

27:05.285 --> 27:06.626
Hi. The refrigerator's a mess.

27:06.661 --> 27:07.967
The goddamn kids, you know?

27:09.668 --> 27:11.899
Whew. What's up?

27:11.934 --> 27:15.601
I just-- I came over to tell you
that they let Roger go.

27:15.636 --> 27:16.965
Yeah,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and he came over this afternoon
swearing up and down

27:19.035 --> 27:21.334
he had nothing to do
with what happened.

27:21.369 --> 27:22.566
Of course.

27:22.601 --> 27:24.332
I just told him to go.

27:24.367 --> 27:26.000
I mean, I kept
looking at him

27:26.035 --> 27:27.634
and thinking,
"Who is this guy?"

27:27.669 --> 27:28.832
Yeah.

27:28.867 --> 27:30.932
I don't know,
Tom.

27:30.967 --> 27:32.533
I guess what
I am trying to say

27:32.568 --> 27:34.167
is that I am really
starting to question

27:34.202 --> 27:36.584
some of the choices I've made.

27:36.619 --> 27:38.932
I think that's,
uh, that's normal

27:38.967 --> 27:41.700
after something like what
you've been through. It's--

27:41.735 --> 27:44.700
How did we let things
get so complicated?

27:44.735 --> 27:47.051
I-- I don't know.

27:47.086 --> 27:49.367
Twenty-nine...

27:50.534 --> 27:52.467
Thirty...

27:53.234 --> 27:54.999
Thirty-one...

27:55.034 --> 27:58.867
You know, this no-drinking thing
looks good on you.

27:58.902 --> 28:00.568
Yeah.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.733
Tommy, maybe we should
give it another shot.

28:07.767 --> 28:08.865
Um...

28:08.900 --> 28:11.167
You have coffee
at your place, right?

28:11.202 --> 28:12.633
Yeah.

28:12.668 --> 28:14.118
Yeah, because I'm all out.

28:14.153 --> 28:15.568
Why don't we
go to your place

28:15.603 --> 28:17.166
and have some coffee

28:17.201 --> 28:19.767
and sit down
and just talk about this?

28:21.568 --> 28:24.266
What do you think?

28:24.301 --> 28:25.434
I think
you have coffee.

28:25.469 --> 28:26.399
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:26.434 --> 28:27.833
Let's go over
to your place and--

28:27.868 --> 28:29.451
Why don't we just
talk here?

28:29.486 --> 28:31.034
Nah, it's better
at your place.

28:31.069 --> 28:32.167
Fifty-eight...

28:33.100 --> 28:34.401
Fifty-nine...

28:35.267 --> 28:36.232
I think
that landscaper

28:36.267 --> 28:37.668
might be ripping us off,
you know?

28:37.703 --> 28:39.299
How?

28:39.334 --> 28:41.334
There's no yellow flowers, you know?

28:41.369 --> 28:42.399
Tommy...

28:42.434 --> 28:43.367
What are you
doing?

28:46.367 --> 28:47.884
Hey.

28:47.919 --> 28:49.366
Oh.

28:49.401 --> 28:51.217
What's going on?

28:51.252 --> 28:53.034
Uh, nothing.

28:54.467 --> 28:55.717
Hi.

28:55.752 --> 28:56.967
Hi.

28:59.267 --> 29:01.367
Are you going to
introduce us?

29:01.402 --> 29:02.732
Yes! Yes.

29:02.767 --> 29:04.832
This is, uh-- this is my wife.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.634
I think I mentioned
my ex-wife Janet.

29:06.669 --> 29:08.401
Oh, yeah, the Janet
you said was crazy?

29:08.436 --> 29:10.199
I don't think I used that word.

29:10.234 --> 29:12.434
We had a fight,
and I think I was a little...

29:12.469 --> 29:14.201
- Oh.
- ...pissed off still.

29:14.236 --> 29:15.798
Ahem.

29:15.833 --> 29:16.833
And you are?

29:23.301 --> 29:25.568
You don't even know
her name.

29:25.603 --> 29:26.599
What are you, nuts?

29:26.634 --> 29:27.865
Of course I know her name.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.301
We've been dating
for over a month.

29:29.336 --> 29:30.934
Yeah. This is...

29:30.969 --> 29:31.800
Lauren.

29:33.201 --> 29:34.617
Ah, shit,
I knew it was Nancy.

29:34.652 --> 29:35.999
You don't even know my name?

29:36.038 --> 29:38.680
I know your name. I got hit
in the head a couple days ago.

29:38.727 --> 29:40.672
- Things are a little scrambled.
- This is perfect.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.434
- What are you looking at, bitch?
- Okay.

29:42.469 --> 29:43.868
Honey, are those tits real?

29:43.903 --> 29:45.401
Janet, don't.
Just go home.

29:45.436 --> 29:46.900
And I thought I was an idiot.

29:46.935 --> 29:47.951
Oh, you know what?

29:47.986 --> 29:49.043
These tits
are real,

29:49.078 --> 29:50.100
and they're
spectacular.

29:50.135 --> 29:51.099
- Uh-huh.
- Whore!

29:51.134 --> 29:52.299
Hey, come on, all right?

29:52.334 --> 29:54.099
- That's right.
- Inside.

29:54.134 --> 29:57.234
Walk away, bitch! Keep
walking! You don't want any of this!

29:57.269 --> 29:58.601
By the way, it's Karen!

29:58.636 --> 29:59.899
- Karen?
- Just take me home.

29:59.934 --> 30:02.134
- Okay. Where's your car?
- You know what? I took a cab!

30:02.169 --> 30:03.201
All right. Get in the truck.

30:06.634 --> 30:07.965
Oh, great.
It's locked!

30:08.000 --> 30:09.234
All right.
I'll get the keys.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.000
Hey, hey, hey!

30:12.035 --> 30:12.999
Hey!

30:13.034 --> 30:14.601
Just knock it off.

30:14.636 --> 30:15.467
Hey!

30:17.934 --> 30:19.867
"So just give me the knife,

30:19.902 --> 30:22.767
and I can end it all."

30:26.034 --> 30:27.800
Very powerful.

30:29.134 --> 30:31.867
You've written
from the heart,

30:31.902 --> 30:34.099
and it's just
so telling.

30:34.134 --> 30:37.668
I'd like to, uh,
open up the room.

30:37.703 --> 30:38.867
If anyone
has any questions

30:38.902 --> 30:41.301
for Lieutenant Shea.

30:41.336 --> 30:42.832
First of all,

30:42.867 --> 30:48.634
thank you for having the courage
to come here and share yourself

30:48.669 --> 30:50.384
with all of us.

30:50.419 --> 30:51.810
No big deal.

30:51.845 --> 30:53.166
Your poems

30:53.201 --> 30:56.965
were frightening,
yet beautiful.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.034
It took me back to Ground Zero
like it was yesterday.

31:01.069 --> 31:04.100
So you were there?
In one of the towers?

31:04.135 --> 31:05.965
No.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.733
You were in Lower Manhattan?

31:08.768 --> 31:11.100
I was in Manhattan...

31:13.234 --> 31:16.534
On the upper east side,

31:16.569 --> 31:18.367
getting a bagel.

31:19.833 --> 31:20.932
Oh.

31:20.967 --> 31:22.432
I'm sorry.

31:22.467 --> 31:23.767
I-- I just assumed--

31:25.534 --> 31:28.334
I mean,
I know you're all suffering

31:28.369 --> 31:30.999
from post-traumatic stress.

31:31.034 --> 31:33.367
I thought
you were actually there.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.367
Was anybody there?

31:38.534 --> 31:40.833
I was in Jersey
that day.

31:40.868 --> 31:42.568
I saw the smoke.

31:44.301 --> 31:46.534
I was in Paris.

31:46.569 --> 31:48.865
France.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.134
Yes, that Paris.

31:52.267 --> 31:54.601
Well, what do you got
to be stressed about?

31:54.636 --> 31:57.434
I wish I was going to Paris.

31:57.469 --> 31:59.032
I mean--

31:59.067 --> 32:00.765
Get a load of this guy.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.134
Proximity isn't the primary
influence on trauma, lieutenant.

32:03.169 --> 32:05.401
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:05.436 --> 32:07.599
So no one was actually there?

32:07.634 --> 32:08.900
I mean,
is that what I'm hearing?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.399
You were there.

32:13.434 --> 32:15.534
No, I was
at a conference

32:15.569 --> 32:16.568
in Virginia.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.434
Did anyone lose a family member?

32:24.469 --> 32:27.599
A close friend?

32:27.634 --> 32:30.867
Well, let me ask you this, then.

32:30.902 --> 32:34.100
Was anybody here
directly affected

32:34.135 --> 32:36.267
by the events of that day?

32:36.302 --> 32:37.533
I have a neighbor

32:37.568 --> 32:40.034
who has a cousin
who has a friend

32:40.069 --> 32:41.685
who lost someone.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.301
I can't believe this.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.299
What's wrong?

32:44.334 --> 32:46.566
What-- Everything is wrong!

32:46.601 --> 32:48.399
You're all a bunch
of goddamn pussies.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.601
Lieutenant, in this room,
we try not to use--

32:50.636 --> 32:51.968
No, no, no, no. No.

32:52.003 --> 32:53.266
They come in here,

32:53.301 --> 32:57.934
crying and pretending
that your lives were affected

32:57.969 --> 32:59.501
because of this,
okay?

32:59.536 --> 33:00.999
There are people
out there

33:01.034 --> 33:03.767
whose lives are never
gonna be the same.

33:03.802 --> 33:07.099
Fathers and mothers and kids--

33:07.134 --> 33:09.917
everyone who waited and prayed,
on that day,

33:09.952 --> 33:12.700
for someone to just come home
from work...

33:14.568 --> 33:16.634
to just walk through
the goddamn door...

33:17.700 --> 33:18.867
once more.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.099
Not to mention
us poor bastards

33:23.134 --> 33:25.500
who had to march
into that nightmare,

33:25.535 --> 33:27.867
and, if we were lucky,
to come out again,

33:27.902 --> 33:29.832
shells of what we used to be.

33:29.867 --> 33:31.867
We were all part of it
in our own way.

33:31.902 --> 33:33.768
You were in Virginia!

33:33.803 --> 33:36.251
That's it. I'm done.

33:36.286 --> 33:38.700
Lieutenant, I'm sorry--

33:38.735 --> 33:39.884
No. No, doc.

33:39.919 --> 33:40.999
Don't be sorry,

33:41.034 --> 33:43.067
because this was a very
cathartic experience, okay?

33:43.102 --> 33:44.566
Thanks to you,

33:44.638 --> 33:46.911
I'm not gonna be writing
any shitty poetry again!

33:47.467 --> 33:49.568
Bunch of frigging crybabies.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.301
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

34:02.336 --> 34:03.367
Everybody, inside.

34:03.402 --> 34:04.832
You!

34:04.867 --> 34:06.934
Are you deaf?
Did you hear me?

34:06.969 --> 34:07.965
I said, inside!

34:08.000 --> 34:09.534
Come inside, I said.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.166
Hey!

34:12.201 --> 34:14.065
What do you want?

34:14.114 --> 34:15.677
You put your hands on her again,

34:15.735 --> 34:17.645
and I'll come back here
and burn your house down.

34:17.703 --> 34:18.697
Who the hell are you?

34:18.733 --> 34:19.967
I don't know
who you are,

34:20.002 --> 34:21.032
but I'm her father.

34:21.067 --> 34:23.032
You're gonna tell me what to do?

34:23.067 --> 34:25.797
I got three
of these damn foster kids.

34:25.833 --> 34:28.067
The city doesn't pay me enough
to have to deal with

34:28.101 --> 34:29.568
this little bitch
who won't listen.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.099
Come on, come on,
come on!

34:31.134 --> 34:34.266
Hey, I told you
to keep your hands off her.

34:36.201 --> 34:37.166
Come here, sweetheart.

34:37.221 --> 34:39.061
- All right, take her.
- I will.

34:39.601 --> 34:41.568
Little piece of shit
won't listen anyway.

34:41.603 --> 34:43.266
Thank you
for getting me, Daddy.

34:51.234 --> 34:52.733
Jesus, Franco.
Where is she now?

34:52.768 --> 34:53.764
She's at my place.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.864
I got
an old girlfriend

34:54.900 --> 34:57.499
to come and sit
with her for the day.

34:57.534 --> 34:59.800
Man, that's like kidnapping.
You know, that's a crime.

34:59.832 --> 35:02.746
Yeah, I know, I was just going over
there to make sure everything was okay.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.366
The guy was hitting her,
calling her names.

35:04.401 --> 35:06.601
- What was I supposed to do?
- I know, man, but still--

35:06.636 --> 35:08.299
Yeah, I know.
I know.

35:08.334 --> 35:11.934
I mean, she's not really
your responsibility anymore.

35:11.969 --> 35:14.767
You know, I couldn't even
sleep last night, Tom.

35:14.802 --> 35:15.932
I kept waiting on the cops

35:15.967 --> 35:17.667
to bust down the door
and arrest me.

35:17.702 --> 35:19.501
This morning,
I was on my way to work,

35:19.536 --> 35:21.301
a siren went off--
I almost shit myself.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.801
What am I gonna
do, Tom?

35:23.836 --> 35:26.267
I'll call my brother Johnny.

35:26.302 --> 35:27.634
Yeah. Thanks.

35:30.401 --> 35:31.401
Hey, chief.

35:31.436 --> 35:32.399
Hey.

35:32.434 --> 35:33.865
- Guess what?
- What?

35:33.900 --> 35:35.517
I got a date with
you-know-who tonight,

35:35.552 --> 35:37.134
so I can pretty much
smell that 80 bucks.

35:37.169 --> 35:39.366
Hey, look, Garrity,
we gotta talk.

35:39.401 --> 35:41.100
This has been going on
entirely too long.

35:41.135 --> 35:42.351
I know
what you're gonna say.

35:42.386 --> 35:43.533
Well, I don't think you do.

35:43.568 --> 35:45.267
You know, that chick
you've been seeing--

35:45.302 --> 35:47.267
I know. She's a guy.

35:47.302 --> 35:48.566
What? You know?

35:48.601 --> 35:50.000
Come on, chief.
I'm not that stupid.

35:50.043 --> 35:52.527
So all that stuff you've been telling us
about making out

35:52.603 --> 35:53.765
and sucking on her boobs was--

35:53.800 --> 35:56.266
- No, that happened.
- When did you find out?

35:56.301 --> 35:59.100
The other night
while I was getting a blowjob.

35:59.135 --> 36:00.065
Oh, Garrity!

36:00.100 --> 36:01.366
Yeah, I know. It was crazy.

36:01.401 --> 36:03.601
I was just along for the ride,
having a great time,

36:03.636 --> 36:05.201
and I go to reach
under the skirt--

36:05.236 --> 36:06.534
- Hello!
- Oscar Mayer?

36:06.569 --> 36:07.865
Frank and beans.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.167
- Man, you must have freaked out.
- Yeah. It was pretty weird.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.932
I didn't want to make
a big scene, though,

36:11.967 --> 36:14.167
so as soon as he was through,
I told him I wasn't--

36:14.202 --> 36:16.367
Wha-- No, hold on a second.
"After he was through"?

36:16.402 --> 36:18.001
You mean you let him
finish the knobjob?

36:18.036 --> 36:19.601
Chief, the guy was giving me
a blowjob.

36:19.636 --> 36:20.865
I didn't wanna be rude.

36:20.900 --> 36:23.301
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that, hmm?

36:23.336 --> 36:24.965
Hey, don't tell Tommy,
all right?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.401
I'm gonna play a trick on him.
I wait a couple weeks,

36:27.428 --> 36:30.086
then tell him I'm getting married.
That's funny, yeah?

36:30.137 --> 36:31.568
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:31.603 --> 36:33.732
That's funny.

36:33.767 --> 36:34.967
Are you out
of your mind?

36:35.002 --> 36:36.332
That's what
I said.

36:36.367 --> 36:38.217
Jesus Christ. Kidnapping?
That's a serious offense.

36:38.257 --> 36:40.387
We're talking a nice
stretch of time for that shit.

36:40.409 --> 36:41.247
Goddamn it.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.867
Lucky for you,
it won't be a problem.

36:42.902 --> 36:44.032
It won't?
What do you mean?

36:44.067 --> 36:45.832
Well, what happened
when you took this kid?

36:45.867 --> 36:48.234
The guy come running after you?
Did he start yelling?

36:48.269 --> 36:49.867
Nah, no, he just
sort of stood there.

36:49.902 --> 36:51.032
You know, actually,

36:51.067 --> 36:53.267
he kind of told me
to go ahead and take her.

36:53.302 --> 36:54.618
- Of course.
- What's your point?

36:54.653 --> 36:55.934
My point is,
this guy's thrilled.

36:55.969 --> 36:57.432
Some of these foster parents,

36:57.467 --> 36:59.700
they never met a background
check they couldn't dance around.

36:59.735 --> 37:00.932
Bottom line,

37:00.967 --> 37:02.965
the guy gets a check
from the state every month.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.401
If you don't got to spend it
on the kid, it's beautiful.

37:05.436 --> 37:07.002
But what if he calls
Family Services?

37:07.037 --> 37:08.568
The cops knock your door down
last night?

37:08.603 --> 37:10.168
- No.
- This morning?

37:10.203 --> 37:11.698
He's not gonna call.

37:11.733 --> 37:13.633
Won't Family Services
check up on her and find out?

37:13.668 --> 37:15.534
Franco, you think
the Fire Department's messed up?

37:15.572 --> 37:17.153
You ain't
seen nothing yet.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.309
By the time Family Services figures out
she's not where she's supposed to be,

37:20.367 --> 37:22.367
she's gonna be putting
her own kids up for placement,

37:22.402 --> 37:23.499
all right?

37:23.534 --> 37:24.765
Enjoy your daughter.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.401
You gonna buy me a slice,
or what?

37:26.436 --> 37:27.618
Yeah, yeah. Happy?

37:27.653 --> 37:28.800
- Yeah.
- All right.

37:28.835 --> 37:30.100
Thanks.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.301
Hey,
where's your mom?

37:35.336 --> 37:36.499
Upstairs.

37:36.534 --> 37:38.434
She said
she doesn't want to see you.

37:38.469 --> 37:39.798
Perfect.

37:39.833 --> 37:41.633
Where's everybody else?

37:41.668 --> 37:44.934
Colleen and Connor
don't want to go.

37:44.969 --> 37:45.899
What?

37:45.934 --> 37:47.399
What's up?

37:47.434 --> 37:50.568
Mom says I'm old enough to
decide when I want to see you

37:50.603 --> 37:51.932
or not.

37:51.967 --> 37:53.967
Well, guess what? Today's
the day we see each other,

37:54.002 --> 37:54.999
so you're seeing me.

37:55.034 --> 37:56.434
Get your stuff.
Stop screwing around.

37:56.469 --> 37:58.301
Come on. Let's go.

37:59.601 --> 38:00.850
Hey, Daddy?

38:00.885 --> 38:02.326
Yes, princess?

38:02.361 --> 38:03.767
What's a whore?

38:03.802 --> 38:04.732
A-- What?

38:04.767 --> 38:06.399
What's a whore?

38:06.434 --> 38:08.117
That-that's-- that's a word--

38:08.152 --> 38:09.765
that's a very bad word
that I--

38:09.800 --> 38:12.467
Just finish your orange.
Finish your orange.

38:12.502 --> 38:13.434
Daddy?

38:15.301 --> 38:17.732
That didn't answer my question.

38:17.767 --> 38:20.167
All right, give me the orange.
You gotta go get your stuff.

38:20.202 --> 38:21.166
Hurry up.
Go get it.

38:21.201 --> 38:23.201
Get your stuff
and get ready.

38:54.301 --> 38:56.501
Everybody, out front.
Hurry up. Come on.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.599
This is bullshit, man.

39:00.634 --> 39:02.833
The fire was in the front
room on the ground floor.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.470
They break all my windows
in the back.

39:04.495 --> 39:06.292
The television set
in the living room's ruined.

39:06.332 --> 39:09.105
- We're doing everything we can, sir.
- I'm sure you are.

39:09.883 --> 39:12.295
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah. What happened?

39:12.385 --> 39:13.320
I don't know.

39:13.367 --> 39:15.800
I must've left the TV on and
it shorted out or something.

39:15.835 --> 39:17.451
I'm putting these guys to bed.

39:17.486 --> 39:19.067
I'm gonna finish dealing
with these guys,

39:19.102 --> 39:20.668
and I'm gonna need
a place to stay.

39:20.703 --> 39:22.367
Oh, don't even think about it.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.201
Now, come on, kids.
Come on.

39:25.236 --> 39:26.366
Thanks.

39:26.401 --> 39:27.932
It looks like
somebody threw

39:27.967 --> 39:30.333
a Molotov cocktail of some kind
through your front window.

39:30.378 --> 39:31.999
Impossible.
What are you talking about?

39:32.052 --> 39:33.253
No. We found it.

39:33.281 --> 39:35.483
There was a bottle filled
with lighter fluid,

39:35.536 --> 39:36.899
and it was taped to this thing.

39:36.934 --> 39:39.383
I think it's one of
those snow globes.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.833
Who the hell
would do something like this?

39:41.868 --> 39:43.700
Unbelievable.

39:45.434 --> 39:47.301
Hey.

39:49.067 --> 39:50.199
Sunshine.

39:50.234 --> 39:51.665
Hey.

39:51.700 --> 39:52.899
What are you, laying over,

39:52.934 --> 39:54.634
or did you stay here
last night?

39:56.334 --> 39:57.800
Had a fire at my house.

39:57.835 --> 39:59.367
What? Bad?

39:59.402 --> 40:00.901
First floor.

40:00.936 --> 40:02.366
Jeez, Tommy.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.234
Well, I hate to be the bearer
of even more bad news.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.634
I was just coming
around the corner,

40:06.669 --> 40:08.201
getting
a cup of coffee,

40:08.236 --> 40:09.698
and I saw some blonde raging,

40:09.747 --> 40:12.159
throwing a brick right through
the windshield of your car.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.842
I chased her, but she jumped
in her car and got away.

40:14.902 --> 40:16.867
I did get the make and model
of the car.

40:16.902 --> 40:18.184
- Want me to call the cops?
- No.

40:18.219 --> 40:19.467
- Don't wanna call the cops?
- No!

40:19.502 --> 40:20.533
- Why not?
- Hey, fellas.

40:20.568 --> 40:22.267
Wish me luck.
I'm getting married.

40:22.302 --> 40:23.466
- What?
- Yeah.

40:23.501 --> 40:25.501
I'm engaged to that girl
you hooked me up with.

40:25.536 --> 40:26.900
Isn't that great?

40:26.935 --> 40:28.732
Huh?

40:28.767 --> 40:30.967
Hey, Tom, I'm--

40:32.301 --> 40:33.733
You told him, didn't you?

40:33.768 --> 40:34.698
Mm-mm.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.334
You told him.
Come on, chief.

40:54.067 --> 40:57.467
Hey, there, kiddo.
Can I get you out of here, huh?

40:59.967 --> 41:00.932
Watch your arm.

41:00.967 --> 41:02.967
Watch your head, sweetie.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.432
All right.

41:04.467 --> 41:06.700
Why can't I live
with you?

41:06.735 --> 41:07.700
Well, come on, now.

41:07.735 --> 41:08.665
This is nice.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.134
You got grass
and trees, you know?

41:10.169 --> 41:12.501
You could run around. Huh?

41:12.536 --> 41:13.668
Hey, baby.

41:13.703 --> 41:14.765
Hey, Ma.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.234
And you must be Keela.

41:16.269 --> 41:17.665
Yeah.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.967
Would you like to come
and help me? I'm making bread.

41:20.002 --> 41:20.965
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.867
- Sounds good, huh?
- Good.

41:22.902 --> 41:24.065
Oh!

41:24.100 --> 41:25.432
Hey, Ma,
thanks a lot.

41:25.474 --> 41:27.657
I'll send money every couple weeks.
Don't worry about that.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.099
Yeah. We'll see how it goes.

41:29.134 --> 41:30.900
If it's too much,
if it's a problem.

41:30.935 --> 41:32.417
Yeah. I know. Um--

41:32.452 --> 41:33.865
What did Dad say?

41:33.900 --> 41:35.798
I haven't told him yet.

41:35.833 --> 41:38.668
I thought I'd leave that
up to you.

41:41.467 --> 41:43.534
Come on, sweetheart.

42:02.335 --> 42:05.335
