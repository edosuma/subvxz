WEBVTT

00:15.283 --> 00:17.285
Previously on
The White Princess...

00:17.385 --> 00:20.254
King Henry sent us here to
fetch you back to London.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.589
We will come willingly,
of course.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.324
I am to be the spoils of war?

00:23.424 --> 00:24.958
The wife
of a marauding madman

00:25.059 --> 00:26.227
whose mother
even murdered children

00:26.327 --> 00:27.595
just so he could
snatch the throne?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.430
This is yours now, Henry.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.798
Your kingdom.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.701
He based his claim for England
on you being by his side.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.503
What if I don't choose
to marry her?

00:35.603 --> 00:37.471
The Yorks will rise up
in her defense.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.039
Your mother bids you
to rape me?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.408
You think you have
free will in this?

00:40.508 --> 00:41.775
I am the king and I do not.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.377
Let's get it over then.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.347
A child! My grandson!

00:46.447 --> 00:47.948
He will be ours,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.683
our own rose of York.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.153
Are we certain
the York Princes
are truly dead?

00:52.253 --> 00:53.754
They are both dead.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.224
They think that you are dead,
my love, and so you will be
if you don't hide now.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.825
I will plot to bring
my brother back.

00:57.925 --> 01:01.329
I will fight them from within
my marriage and they
will not even know it.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.464
"Humble and penitent"
may be damned.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.135
"Hidden and patient."
That will be my motto.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.232
Your Grace?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.202
The king is calling for you.

02:26.747 --> 02:27.715
Are you well?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.261
My sickness is now
almost passed.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.371
Bishop Morton.
Welcome to our court.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.274
I am most honored
by his Grace, your son.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.743
I find myself appointed
to the royal council

03:29.843 --> 03:32.012
and made
Chancellor of England.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.615
God's will and ours are one.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.921
And the girl?
Is she obedient?

03:41.355 --> 03:44.592
She has a role to play,
but not the mother.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.608
Your smile is
almost convincing.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.543
My face aches from it.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.646
And if I have to hear
about his years in exile
one more time

04:05.746 --> 04:09.483
I think that I will choke him
with the pheasant legs
he has such a taste for.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.652
Henry. Bishop Morton.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.322
However will I keep it up for
eight weeks on Royal Progress?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.624
Don't be downcast.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.560
We shall make it work
to our advantage.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.662
I just wish I was
coming with you.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.499
Bishop Morton has
arrived at court. I wish...

04:25.599 --> 04:26.967
My daughter's dress
is cutting in

04:27.067 --> 04:28.436
and troubling the baby.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.037
We will change it in her rooms.

04:41.349 --> 04:44.718
Royal Progress is
our chance to flush out
who is still for York.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.186
Our first contact is crucial

04:46.354 --> 04:47.555
as we'll know
who else supports us.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.222
The De La Pools are out,

04:49.357 --> 04:51.559
they turned their coats
so quickly they don't have
a spine between them.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.531
The Staffords have refused
to bend their knee to Henry

04:57.631 --> 04:59.767
but he knows them all
as rebels so we cannot
go to them.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.635
Francis Lovell.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.803
Lovell?

05:03.471 --> 05:04.805
I thought he had
sworn fealty to Tudor?

05:04.905 --> 05:08.376
Richard said he was
the purest, whitest York
in all of England.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.743
He said he would
trust him with his life.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.381
No matter what he said
or did to fool his enemies,

05:13.481 --> 05:14.948
he was a York
right to his core.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.250
Then Lovell is our man.
Where can we find him?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.419
York...

05:25.393 --> 05:28.061
I ride through England,
and I do what exactly?

05:28.662 --> 05:32.466
You show off your person.
Your righteous sovereignty.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.006
That's it? I just "parade"?

05:40.408 --> 05:41.942
The people need
to see you with
their own eyes.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.512
And you must look
to them as wealthy
and as regal

05:44.612 --> 05:46.580
as God made you.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.782
Which is why
your likeness
will soon grace

05:48.882 --> 05:50.718
every sovereign
from the royal mint.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.826
This one.
And this.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.428
No. Black.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.565
I wish to keep it plain.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.900
You must wear
a sword though.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.471
I thought this was
to win their hearts

06:10.571 --> 06:11.672
not threaten them
with bloodshed?

06:12.239 --> 06:14.307
Your subjects are still
reeling from the battle

06:14.508 --> 06:15.943
and the change
of House.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.079
The wounds of England
will take time to heal.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.715
There may be

06:23.083 --> 06:24.718
skirmishes.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.856
The Yorks
are routed, Henry.
They are gone.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.626
There is none
to come against you now.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.001
Which route will
the Progress take?

06:42.770 --> 06:45.739
I have old friends
I should like to see
if we journey close.

06:46.006 --> 06:46.974
Old Yorks?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.742
Or once were Yorks.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.811
But now
my house is broken.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.948
Thanks to me.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.852
If I do not even
pay my respects,

06:58.952 --> 07:00.854
they will think
I am your prisoner.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.091
And how would that support
your image of two Houses

07:04.191 --> 07:07.495
now united by a happy,
peaceable marriage?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.536
We will journey
via Northampton

07:15.636 --> 07:17.905
through to Nottingham
and up to Lancaster.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.273
Not York?

07:20.508 --> 07:21.609
Of course not York.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.779
The place is
for its namesake,
your old House.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.849
The last
stronghold of traitors
has its nest there.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.721
Why do you smile?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.525
Because you lend them
greater power
if you fear them.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.661
What?

07:41.929 --> 07:43.997
Three stray Stafford rebels?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.634
And all the Tudor guards
with you

07:46.734 --> 07:49.136
and you fear
three beleaguered men
without an axe between them?

07:53.774 --> 07:56.544
You will turn them into heroes
if you fear to venture close.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.914
Tell me who you wish
to visit.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.750
The meeting will
take place in public

08:02.850 --> 08:05.586
and you will say
you're happy
with your lot.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.061
Two cargo ships
in the English Channel

08:14.161 --> 08:15.963
have been pirated
by Burgundy.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.132
Retaliation for the trading
rights we made them forfeit.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.901
How much has
the York bitch taken?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.904
Nothing of concern.
Mostly wine imports.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.305
Jasper?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.708
My Progress will
travel via York

08:27.808 --> 08:29.843
and grant
a royal audience there.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.044
York? Henry...

08:31.144 --> 08:33.914
I will not have them
thinking I'm afraid.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.463
Dear Francis Lovell,

08:50.598 --> 08:53.601
our lives are very changed
since the last time that we met.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.637
But I should like to see you
as I travel via York on
progress with the king.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.708
What is your name?

09:00.808 --> 09:02.275
Ruth, Your Grace.
Ruth.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.947
If I asked you
to convey a letter,

09:07.047 --> 09:10.083
could I trust that
it would not reach
Lady Margaret or the King?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.719
Of course,
Your Grace.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.787
Thank you, Ruth.

09:31.972 --> 09:32.973
Thank you.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.643
Girls. Your riding lesson.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.113
Dear Harry Stafford,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.883
Lizzie disappoints me.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.919
I hoped that she would stand
against her husband,

09:46.019 --> 09:47.855
and be loyal
to her own House, York,

09:49.857 --> 09:52.292
but she likes King Henry
more than I imagined
that she could,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.294
and is obedient to him.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.372
My-Lady-
the-King's-Mother?

10:15.883 --> 10:18.551
Her sole complaint with
Henry would seem to be

10:18.752 --> 10:20.287
within the marriage bed,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.359
as she grumbles
that his manhood

10:26.459 --> 10:29.730
rarely rises to occasion
and even when it does,

10:29.830 --> 10:32.700
he tries to thrust it
into the wrong...

10:59.793 --> 11:01.328
Cecily?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.736
How are
your rooms?

11:09.937 --> 11:11.304
Do you need
anything?

11:12.439 --> 11:13.941
New dresses?

11:14.341 --> 11:17.077
Oh, yes,
that would be...

11:17.177 --> 11:18.345
Thank you!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.748
Lizzie has so many,
I seem to have been
forgotten.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.149
And your mother?

11:22.249 --> 11:23.383
Well, how is she?

11:23.751 --> 11:26.419
It must be hard for her now
in my shadow.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.421
Hard for her to lose.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.123
Oh, my mother
doesn't lose.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.025
She always finds
a way to win.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.961
Ask Lizzie. They're
hand in glove together.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.070
I shall miss you
while you're gone.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.774
I will have no-one to share
my wickedness.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.410
You look radiant.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.181
The child is blooming.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.318
Thank you,
my Lady-the-King's-Mother.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.388
Which is why
you shouldn't travel.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.190
Oh, I am quite well.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.994
The war has left
its scars on England.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.562
And some say
sickness comes.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.899
Along the route
the Tudor army took,
I heard.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.633
An army formed
of convicts

12:13.801 --> 12:15.635
from the filthiest
jails in Europe.

12:15.803 --> 12:16.904
We should not be surprised.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.907
I do not think
the two things
are related,

12:20.007 --> 12:23.811
but we should not take
a chance with you.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.412
No,

12:27.247 --> 12:28.481
perhaps she's right.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.384
I shall go on Progress
in your place.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.486
I'm York
and will do just as well
to show England

12:33.586 --> 12:34.888
that the Houses live
in peace and harmony.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.827
Remember Lizzie,
"Humble and penitent."

12:52.940 --> 12:55.843
It was your mother's idea,
of course, to keep me here.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.211
Whatever you may think,

12:58.311 --> 13:00.313
she has your
best interests
at heart.

13:01.648 --> 13:02.916
Will you at least
write to me
while you are gone?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.753
I will be bored
beyond endurance.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.155
You may at least send news

13:08.255 --> 13:10.423
to entertain me
and provide distraction.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.059
As you wish.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.562
It will look better
in England's eyes
in any case,

13:15.662 --> 13:19.066
a marriage
with true care
and love in it.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.975
It should be me
who's going,

13:28.075 --> 13:29.910
I'm supposed to be his prize.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.778
But you must seem
to be obedient

13:31.879 --> 13:33.480
if we're not to set off
warning bells.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.882
And you would like
another round

13:34.948 --> 13:36.984
of playing Queen,
no doubt,

13:37.084 --> 13:39.152
driving all the plots
yourself.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.255
We must each do
what we can,
my Lizzie.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.129
The midwife
will consult with you.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.001
Take care, my Lizzie.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.169
I'll write.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.114
Bishop Morton wishes
to speak with you

14:07.214 --> 14:08.982
about her care
before we leave.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.584
Oh.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.125
Come on.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.930
Lady Mother,
what are we doing?

14:22.996 --> 14:25.332
Yeah, Mother, what
was that about?

14:28.235 --> 14:29.669
- Stay still there.
- Mother!

14:29.769 --> 14:30.803
- Lady Mother!
- Let me see!

14:31.004 --> 14:32.105
No.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.473
What's this?
Get off me. Get off me!

14:33.573 --> 14:34.541
Take your hands off them!

14:34.641 --> 14:35.808
Stay still.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.278
Stop it!
Don't touch her.
Come here!

14:43.316 --> 14:45.385
We will need those
while on Progress!

14:46.119 --> 14:47.587
Why would you care?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.290
A victory march for Tudor?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.325
Why would you even
want to be there?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.562
Unless you had a plot
you wished
to put into effect.

14:55.662 --> 14:56.964
What plot?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.166
You will remain here
until the King is back.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.971
I will return to pray
with you each day.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.484
Let us out of here!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.687
Let us out!

15:27.394 --> 15:28.628
I thought you said
we need a York

15:28.728 --> 15:30.130
to show we are united?

15:30.463 --> 15:33.700
And we have plenty
of the ones who are
now loyal to us.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.770
Henry. It has been lonely
all these years without you.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.342
I hope this trip will give us
time to know each other again.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.551
The sickness has reached
London to the west.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.022
Are we certain
we should take the risk?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.225
The scouts will ride
ahead of us.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.127
If there is danger,
we will know.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.465
Our boy must claim
his kingdom

16:06.233 --> 16:08.635
or the dangers
will be even greater.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.784
Where is my lady's
side-saddle?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.487
I cannot ride astride,
it is immodest!

16:27.820 --> 16:29.289
These are
different times,
Eliza.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.259
And we must learn
to change, or die.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.163
Catherine!

16:39.632 --> 16:42.169
Watch for Ned,
the stable lad.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.504
Watch closely now.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.775
Anne, pick some
horse hairs off my cape.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.549
Stand.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.251
Stand still now.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.872
Can you see
my mother, Maggie?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.308
I think so.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.510
Or is that her?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.212
Let's ride on the horses!

17:25.312 --> 17:27.247
Lizzie, can we
ride on the horses?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.949
No, Teddy. The horses
are going somewhere else.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.385
But we could play
Pins or Fox and Geese?

17:32.485 --> 17:34.454
Yes! Pins!
Or Fox and Geese!

17:34.554 --> 17:37.257
At least we can have fun
while they're gone.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.670
Good weather for it too,
young Henry.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.639
God must be on our side.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.749
Fetch me some soot.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.855
Keep watching, Catherine.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.857
What did he say
to you?

18:10.957 --> 18:12.325
The horse wasn't
groomed.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.577
Where are the games?

18:30.677 --> 18:31.778
The Pins?
Pins!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.680
They have been
tidied away, Your Grace.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.648
Away?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.526
The public rooms
are being closed

18:46.726 --> 18:48.528
while the court
is out on Progress.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.197
We are not on Progress.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.599
Your rooms
are being tended to.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.301
Where are the games,
Lizzie?

18:55.402 --> 18:57.670
My Lady-the-King's-Mother

18:57.970 --> 18:59.572
has left instructions
for your care.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.841
Where is my grandmother?

19:02.742 --> 19:03.776
The Duchess Cecily?

19:04.811 --> 19:05.812
If my mother
is not with me,

19:05.912 --> 19:06.879
I shall have
my grandmother.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.316
She will be brought to you...

19:09.416 --> 19:11.518
when you are in your rooms.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.777
Lady Mother.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.259
Ned.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.885
At last! I thought
they'd never
let you come.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.186
Yay! Granny Ceci!

20:20.287 --> 20:21.621
Will you play a game?

20:22.088 --> 20:23.790
Yes.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.994
I cannot stay here
with you, Lizzie.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.929
You can, or I will
make them!

20:30.029 --> 20:32.599
No, it's...
It's my choice.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.435
I'm leaving.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.736
But you can't...

20:37.770 --> 20:39.806
England
is too changed.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.676
I never thought I'd say this
to you nor to anyone, but...

20:43.876 --> 20:46.245
- I am afraid.
- What of?

20:47.714 --> 20:49.316
They're
barbarians.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.852
I am so sorry, Lizzie,
for your plight.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.990
Oh, you are so beautiful.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.627
You had such promise.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.028
And I still do.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.599
Your faith must rest now
with your mother.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.572
I am going to
my daughter's palace
in Burgundy.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.514
At least there, there will be
something to drink.

21:45.838 --> 21:46.939
He was angry.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.608
I was lucky
he didn't flay me.
I believe you were.

21:54.681 --> 21:58.451
...bring him to me.

21:58.551 --> 22:02.389
Hey. Hey, what is it?

22:03.390 --> 22:04.290
Right.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.394
You are restless
to hear my magic.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.765
Come on. Once round
the grounds then,

22:12.865 --> 22:14.100
before you sleep.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.076
Bring me Ned.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.690
Hey!

22:39.158 --> 22:40.893
What is it?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.988
To Francis Lovell.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.791
Lizzie wrote to you
to meet her

23:12.124 --> 23:15.862
but both of us have been
held here in Westminster
against our wishes.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.200
The Tudors are an outrage.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.035
They have no claim
to the throne

23:23.135 --> 23:24.871
and yet they force
themselves upon it

23:24.971 --> 23:27.740
with a swagger that must
make God in heaven weep.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.144
They are a canker
that must be cut out

23:32.244 --> 23:33.813
before it has a chance
to spread.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.817
I'm told you are
a loyal Yorkist.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.086
And if you are,

23:40.720 --> 23:44.824
then I beg you,
show your colors now.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.761
The Stafford lords
will help you.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.097
They've opposed
Tudor already.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.932
Francis Lovell?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.668
Please do our bidding,
Lovell.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.506
Do it for my dead son
and for me.

24:00.773 --> 24:05.645
Do it, and we'll put
Edward Plantagenet
on the throne

24:05.745 --> 24:09.148
and a white rose
will grace England
once again.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.797
Your Grace,
King Henry.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.568
We welcome you
to our City of York.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.202
We feared
you would turn back

25:03.302 --> 25:04.637
because of all
the sickness.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.439
Sickness?

25:07.807 --> 25:09.576
It's nothing.
It's passed.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.210
It's...

25:14.581 --> 25:16.148
I have been eager
to survey my lands

25:17.083 --> 25:19.586
and how well Tudor green
suits England.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.660
Please, come. Our taxes
are collected for you.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.429
But first,
the noblemen of York

25:30.597 --> 25:31.631
will show
their fealty to you.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.201
- Bow!
- Your Grace!

25:36.202 --> 25:37.436
Shield the king!

25:37.604 --> 25:39.005
Henry!

25:42.742 --> 25:44.611
Take him! Take him!

25:46.879 --> 25:48.114
Stop that man!

25:48.214 --> 25:50.449
- Protect the king!
- Get him inside!

25:50.617 --> 25:52.952
- Henry!
- Stop him! There, there!

25:53.886 --> 25:54.987
Henry!

26:03.162 --> 26:04.296
Henry.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.699
Henry, let me see.

26:06.799 --> 26:07.734
It's nothing.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.468
Henry, please,
you're bleeding.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.536
Let your mother tend...

26:10.637 --> 26:12.972
What is this sickness
you have kept from me?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.807
And made me look a fool
who does not even know

26:14.907 --> 26:16.042
what happens in his own lands.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.309
It is nothing.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.679
It is normal
for this time of year.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.048
I've barely been
out of London for a week

26:22.148 --> 26:23.349
and already
they're coming for me.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.653
A Yorkist rebel
we had missed.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.087
They will settle.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.255
You will see.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.790
I did not "settle".

26:30.890 --> 26:32.759
Not for 28 long years.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.661
I kept on fighting
for the throne.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.663
And I have no doubt
those who hate me

26:36.763 --> 26:39.331
and reject my claim
will do the same.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.868
Jasper has gone after them.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.671
He will find them
and kill them.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.977
We must come down
hard on them.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.882
Francis Lovell!

27:00.252 --> 27:02.154
Stop in the name of the King!

27:05.892 --> 27:06.926
Lovell!

27:19.438 --> 27:21.173
Stop in the name of the King!

27:23.475 --> 27:24.911
Stop him,
he's a traitor!

27:25.011 --> 27:26.012
Stop him!

27:29.415 --> 27:31.050
In God's name,
what's this?

27:31.784 --> 27:32.985
Turncoats?

27:33.452 --> 27:34.787
Traitors, stand aside!

27:35.387 --> 27:38.858
Turn back!
Turn back to York.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.069
Hyah!

28:15.828 --> 28:17.764
There is no news from anyone?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.032
Mother? Henry?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.201
Perhaps she's not
allowed to, Lizzie.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.771
She would find a way,
you know she would.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.108
Ruth isn't even here.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.779
Maggie, will you
go to the stables

28:32.812 --> 28:35.281
and ask Ned if he's been
passed any letters?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.941
Get back,
there's sickness.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.811
Sickness?
Plague, or something.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.079
I don't know. They sweat
and then they drop down dead.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.015
You mustn't take it
to your mistress.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.817
Is there word
from Lizzie's mother?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.051
Word?

29:12.451 --> 29:13.820
She's up there,
in the old tower.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.889
Would you return this to her?

29:31.203 --> 29:33.639
He says that they are
falling down and dying.

29:34.040 --> 29:34.974
What should we do?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.343
Stay as far
away from them
as possible.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.678
He says your mother
is still here.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.848
That she's locked up
in the old tower.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.382
And all the more
reason that Lizzie
shouldn't know.

29:43.482 --> 29:44.716
She'd only go out
looking for her

29:44.851 --> 29:46.752
and she might
get ill and
harm the baby.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.021
Lady Margaret
said I was to
keep her safe.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.402
No.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.171
No notes.

30:05.571 --> 30:06.973
What is it, Maggie?

30:07.539 --> 30:09.308
Nothing.
It's just...

30:10.176 --> 30:11.911
I wish there was news.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.057
Dear wife.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.895
I had imagined I would write
of triumph on my Progress,

30:29.962 --> 30:32.965
my impressions of my country
and my countrymen,

30:35.234 --> 30:37.136
but one week out of London,
there's a blade

30:37.236 --> 30:39.471
stuck in my flesh

30:39.571 --> 30:42.708
by a York
named Francis Lovell.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.277
I imagine I have you
to thank for that

30:46.045 --> 30:47.313
so you will be
irked to hear

30:47.413 --> 30:49.015
that despite your
best endeavors,

30:49.115 --> 30:53.019
your husband and the father
of your unborn child
still breathes.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.753
Your mother's signature
is over this with yours...

30:54.987 --> 30:56.022
From the King.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.090
...and if she were here
on Progress with me,

30:58.190 --> 31:01.127
I can tell you that she would
not be returned to you alive.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.097
But happily, my mother had
the good sense to leave her

31:05.197 --> 31:07.133
locked up there
in Westminster.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.268
My mother is not with him.
She is here.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.641
You both knew?

31:16.575 --> 31:17.944
There's sickness.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.378
It's the reason
why we didn't tell you.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.948
We didn't want you
or the baby getting ill.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.622
Lizzie,
you are not allowed
to be out here.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.495
How bad is it?

31:38.197 --> 31:39.531
How bad?

31:40.432 --> 31:42.168
People are dying.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.970
Everyone's afraid.

31:44.003 --> 31:44.971
That's why you
haven't seen

31:45.071 --> 31:46.305
the servant girl,
she's dead.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.573
And, and mother?
And the girls?

31:47.673 --> 31:49.976
They're safe.
They're locked up here.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.978
Has anybody sent help
out to the people?

31:57.016 --> 31:58.985
Lizzie, where
are you going?

31:59.051 --> 32:01.487
To do what someone
should have done already.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.324
How long must I be
cooped up here?

32:38.424 --> 32:40.192
I should have ridden out
with Jasper.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.693
Henry, you are the King.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.262
Is this what
it means then, is it?

32:43.362 --> 32:45.431
Crouched here in the darkness
with my mother like a coward.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.233
Tell me,
is this how you saw it?

32:47.333 --> 32:49.068
When you willed me
to be the King of England?

32:49.168 --> 32:52.038
If you are dead
then you are
king of nowhere.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.375
Even a mother's love cannot
pull you from the grave.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.551
Henry, as we are
this far in the north,

33:05.651 --> 33:08.520
I thought we should make
useful politics of it.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.325
King James of Scotland
needs a wife.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.429
We will
meet him on the border
and offer him Elizabeth.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.131
If he accepts...

33:20.132 --> 33:21.733
then England will be
rid of her forever

33:22.068 --> 33:24.936
and the Scottish threat
against us will be ended.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.074
Don't think,
that if we put Elizabeth
in Scotland,

33:28.174 --> 33:30.342
she might bring
the Scottish Army
to attack us,

33:31.210 --> 33:33.179
joining with
the Northern Lords
as they rode down,

33:33.279 --> 33:36.082
till we were hopelessly
outnumbered, slaughtered

33:36.115 --> 33:38.550
and York returned to power,
all in a single stroke?

33:42.088 --> 33:44.590
If you spent less time
flirting with my Uncle Jasper,

33:44.690 --> 33:46.692
perhaps you might give
better counsel.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.467
The people need
physicians,

33:55.567 --> 33:56.535
food and burials.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.105
Unlock the treasure room.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.472
Who has the key?

34:04.410 --> 34:05.744
Who has the key?

34:06.178 --> 34:07.346
I do.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.847
As his Grace's Chancellor.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.549
Then open it.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.385
Madam, you risk
your child's life

34:13.485 --> 34:15.287
and your own
by straying from your...

34:15.387 --> 34:16.555
Kick it down.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.190
They will do
no such...
What?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.126
You would rather
your families die
of plague

34:20.226 --> 34:21.627
'cause you were too afraid
to take my orders?

34:21.727 --> 34:22.694
Break it open!

34:22.794 --> 34:23.929
Madam!

34:24.496 --> 34:26.765
If the king were here
he would order the same.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.367
Open it.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.806
Stop.

34:34.906 --> 34:35.974
Kick it! Kick it!

34:36.142 --> 34:37.743
Stop!
This is robbery
and treason.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.845
Stand back.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.282
Stop.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.586
"Blessed are the
merciful, for they
will be shown mercy."

34:47.686 --> 34:49.488
"Thou shalt not steal."

34:49.588 --> 34:51.056
And this gold
is the King's.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.159
It is our royal duty
to provide.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.561
As you well know as you served
on my father's council.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.029
You are not crowned Queen

34:58.164 --> 34:59.531
and have no jurisdiction.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.700
But unless you plan
to hold me down,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.269
I shall do it anyway.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.645
Have the guards
take this out to the sick.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.181
Watch them safely
from a distance,

35:15.247 --> 35:16.815
but be sure the people get
what they need.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.684
This will not
go unpunished.

35:18.784 --> 35:19.818
There will be
repercussions.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.720
Where is my mother?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.022
She is locked in this palace
and you will tell me where

35:24.190 --> 35:25.524
or I will push this child
from my body,

35:25.624 --> 35:27.293
right here on the floor,

35:27.393 --> 35:28.394
and we will both
bleed to death.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.728
And it will be on your head.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.797
Only a demon
would harm a child.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.272
You are
your mother's daughter.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.714
God will
judge you for your sin.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.430
There is sickness then.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.298
It will play
in our favor.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.938
Cecily, I think I have
caught the sweat.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.243
"Favor"?

36:18.310 --> 36:20.312
People dying?
You think that
that is good?

36:20.412 --> 36:21.680
Of course it is.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.683
They'll blame the king
for bringing it to England.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.118
And think it's God's curse
for claiming
what was never his.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.255
And when enough of them
have died, the rest will

36:29.321 --> 36:31.457
rise up in their grief
and overthrow him.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.359
I sent out food and money.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.994
Physicians to
attend the sick.
You did what?

36:36.262 --> 36:37.363
We are not monsters!

36:37.463 --> 36:39.130
You cannot just
let people die.

36:39.265 --> 36:41.367
It is not at our hand.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.534
It works to our advantage.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.270
Surely you can
see that, Lizzie?

36:44.336 --> 36:45.571
Did you write
to Francis Lovell?

36:45.671 --> 36:47.873
Order him to kill the king?

36:47.973 --> 36:49.575
Of course I did. I...

36:49.675 --> 36:50.776
Is he dead?

36:50.876 --> 36:53.312
No, he is not dead.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.381
He is alive.

36:55.481 --> 36:56.615
How dare you do that?

36:56.715 --> 36:58.116
Write to him
without my knowledge,

36:58.284 --> 37:00.286
and in my name
I would imagine!

37:00.319 --> 37:02.288
We said that
we would come against him,

37:02.388 --> 37:03.789
what else did you
think that meant?

37:03.889 --> 37:08.026
That we would contact
loyal Yorks who would
muster men and mount...

37:10.629 --> 37:12.498
A what?
A... A war!

37:13.765 --> 37:14.866
A battle to depose him.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.435
Not an assassin
in the night!

37:16.535 --> 37:17.669
Oh, I see.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.471
So you would rather
that he died in battle,

37:19.571 --> 37:21.740
where thousands more will
lose their lives beside him,

37:21.840 --> 37:23.475
just so you can feel
a distance from it?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.643
No, of course not!

37:24.743 --> 37:25.877
What, then?

37:25.977 --> 37:27.779
He does not
have to die at all!

37:28.680 --> 37:30.382
We can remove him
from the throne

37:30.482 --> 37:32.083
and send him back to
where he has come from.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.152
Send him back?

37:34.320 --> 37:37.356
And he would just obey,
go, would he?

37:37.456 --> 37:39.425
Find a peasant wife
in Flanders,

37:39.525 --> 37:41.793
realize that's what
he wanted all along.
Maybe take up embroidery.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.562
That is not what I said.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.863
What, then?

37:44.963 --> 37:47.333
Because he will not
give up the crown
while he is breathing.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.934
Even if
he wanted to,

37:49.034 --> 37:50.869
his mother
would not let him.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.376
You have changed your tune.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.177
I thought you wanted him
as dead as I do.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.912
Of course I did.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.348
I do.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.352
But would you
kill a man so easily?

38:07.419 --> 38:08.654
A murderer.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.722
Doesn't that make you
a murderer, too?

38:10.822 --> 38:11.823
Lizzie...

38:14.059 --> 38:16.528
You must smelt iron
in your blood,

38:16.628 --> 38:19.064
if you are to be a queen
and lead our house to victory.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.667
Your moves
are far too obvious.

38:22.701 --> 38:26.004
He knows already that
it was you who sent
Lovell in with a knife.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.273
You will have us all thrown
under lock and key,

38:28.374 --> 38:30.542
and how will that help York
or victory?

38:31.743 --> 38:32.978
And the point is,
whatever plan

38:33.078 --> 38:34.613
we make to fight him
will be up to me.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.384
I am the Queen.
Or soon will be.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.551
Not you.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.988
Well, at least
now you're sounding
like a queen.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.492
Lady Mother,

38:46.592 --> 38:48.627
you must return now
to your rooms.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.662
Bishop Morton says so.

38:51.930 --> 38:56.802
I am to be held there
until the King can decide
what to do with me.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.040
He feels I am a threat
to Tudor rule.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.047
Mine.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.651
Perhaps I'll need it.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.453
God bless us.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.455
If you eat bread,
you won't die.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.457
Teddy, keep your
plague mask on.

39:51.557 --> 39:52.991
- Warwick!
- Earl Warwick!

39:53.091 --> 39:55.160
I'm Warwick!
King Warwick!

39:57.563 --> 39:58.764
King Warwick!

40:01.933 --> 40:03.835
Dear Henry.

40:04.670 --> 40:08.306
Thank you for your letter
but you judge me
far too harshly.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.308
Whatever you may think,
I had no knowledge

40:10.408 --> 40:12.844
of this threat
against your person
and no hand in it.

40:12.944 --> 40:16.414
If you knew me,
then you'd know that this
isn't something I would do.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.117
However we move
through this mess
we've made of England,

40:19.217 --> 40:20.552
know this, at least,

40:21.687 --> 40:23.589
it was not me.
Your Grace.

40:24.289 --> 40:26.424
And now I know
that my mother is imprisoned,

40:26.525 --> 40:28.794
I can rest assured
that it was not her.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.029
So if England
comes against you,

40:31.129 --> 40:34.466
you must look inside yourself
to find the cause.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.868
Your wife in London. Lizzie.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.019
Lovell has fled.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.122
We tailed him as far as
Middleham, but he, uh...

40:57.222 --> 40:58.456
We lost him.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.793
We should make
haste to London.

41:01.893 --> 41:02.928
Why?

41:03.028 --> 41:04.395
We cannot continue
the Progress.

41:04.596 --> 41:05.731
Unrest is breaking out.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.666
Some of your soldiers
are changing sides,

41:07.766 --> 41:09.735
joining with the rebels.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.404
"Changing sides"
to who though?

41:13.539 --> 41:14.706
There's no reason
to unseat me

41:14.806 --> 41:16.407
if they have no other
king to take my place!

41:16.942 --> 41:18.343
They're calling for
the Earl of Warwick,

41:18.610 --> 41:20.946
Teddy.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.748
That fool boy
over Henry?

41:39.865 --> 41:41.800
They say
Henry is cursed by God.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.570
His reign will fail.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.473
He brought the Sweat,

41:48.574 --> 41:50.876
and England will die
under him.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.179
It gives York hope.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.748
This cannot be allowed.
It cannot.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.051
Here.

42:00.586 --> 42:01.987
Take this.

42:10.128 --> 42:12.030
Are they getting
cured now, Maggie?

42:12.130 --> 42:13.298
I think so, Teddy.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.067
Well, they've stopped
dying anyway.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.774
Edward of Warwick.
Warwick! Earl of Warwick!

42:22.874 --> 42:26.778
His Grace the King
orders that you be taken
to the Tower.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.214
No! No! No!

42:29.314 --> 42:30.716
No, you can't!
He's done
nothing wrong!

42:30.816 --> 42:32.317
Please!
No, you can't!

42:32.884 --> 42:35.286
- Teddy!
- Maggie, Maggie help me!

42:35.821 --> 42:37.088
No!
Maggie!

42:37.188 --> 42:38.323
Teddy!
Maggie!

42:40.258 --> 42:41.793
Maggie!

42:42.160 --> 42:43.995
Teddy! Teddy!

42:47.298 --> 42:48.867
Lizzie, they've taken Teddy!

42:48.967 --> 42:50.535
You have to help him!
What?

42:50.636 --> 42:52.170
He's in the Tower, Lizzie.

42:52.437 --> 42:54.272
You have to tell them
that you told us

42:54.372 --> 42:56.474
to give all the food
and the money...

42:56.642 --> 42:58.644
That isn't why
they've taken him,
you idiot.

42:58.710 --> 43:01.647
Use your head.
He is a York boy, Maggie.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.149
He is a threat to Henry
because people might
prefer him on the throne.

43:04.249 --> 43:05.283
You knew of this.

43:05.383 --> 43:07.786
My Lady the King's Mother
writes to me with news.

43:07.886 --> 43:09.721
She told me it would be
for Henry's safety.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.657
Cecily, he is our cousin.

43:11.723 --> 43:13.959
And Henry is
my brother-in-law and King.

43:14.059 --> 43:15.794
So if I must choose
within my family,

43:15.894 --> 43:17.162
I would rather choose
the side that I am afraid of.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.197
Get out. Get out!

43:20.098 --> 43:21.466
I will make sure
they let him out.

43:21.700 --> 43:22.968
You can't.

43:23.068 --> 43:24.836
They will lock you up
if you two try
and leave the palace.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.271
Both of you.

43:26.371 --> 43:27.673
Lizzie.

43:27.773 --> 43:30.408
You know what they do
to York boys in the Tower.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.311
Please don't let them kill him
like they did your brothers!

43:33.411 --> 43:35.681
They only killed
one brother.

43:35.781 --> 43:38.684
Richard escaped, but now
we don't know where he is.

43:44.389 --> 43:46.692
Maggie. Maggie!

43:47.693 --> 43:49.527
You must not speak of it.

43:49.695 --> 43:51.897
We have to help him. Please.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.106
Shh.

44:28.967 --> 44:31.336
How glorious do I look now?

44:31.436 --> 44:34.005
Skulking home in shame
like the exile that I am,

44:34.105 --> 44:36.241
because I brought
the Sweat to England.

44:36.341 --> 44:39.210
The boy has been locked up
and will be dealt with.

44:39.745 --> 44:42.881
We shall set up
a private guard
to keep you safe.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.419
I feel as if
everything I say
is wrong.

44:49.154 --> 44:51.589
Lord knows,
I do not deserve
to be mistreated

44:51.757 --> 44:53.759
after everything
I have done for him.

45:09.775 --> 45:10.976
Guards! Guards!

45:12.844 --> 45:14.980
Get back!
Get back from the King!

45:18.449 --> 45:20.018
Are you deaf?
Get back!

45:20.485 --> 45:21.987
Jasper...
We ride on.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.124
Move aside.
Let us through!

45:32.330 --> 45:34.800
Bless you for
your kindness.

45:36.001 --> 45:37.268
King Henry...

45:38.169 --> 45:40.138
He's merciful.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.473
The King has shown us mercy.

45:42.941 --> 45:43.975
Thank you!

45:56.822 --> 45:59.390
She broke into the palace
treasure room.

46:01.159 --> 46:03.261
You brought this
on yourself, you know.

46:03.361 --> 46:06.031
He will be angry
as he should be.

46:06.898 --> 46:08.266
Please ask him
to let Teddy out.

46:09.835 --> 46:11.970
She threatened
the royal heir's life

46:12.070 --> 46:15.106
and I feared
she would use
witchcraft.

46:15.206 --> 46:16.975
Where is she?
Punish her, Henry.

46:17.075 --> 46:18.844
Severely.

46:19.845 --> 46:21.880
She must not get away
with this.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.381
You cannot leave people
dying in the streets

46:56.481 --> 46:58.283
when we have a means
to help them.

46:59.617 --> 47:01.486
I will take whatever
punishment you give me.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.289
You make it look so easy.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.894
You know just what to do
to make them love you.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.528
You reap what
you sow, Henry.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.465
You rule with fear

47:14.565 --> 47:16.902
and you will only get
dissent and hatred
in return.

47:18.269 --> 47:19.905
You take before
a man will give

47:19.971 --> 47:21.907
and you will
never win him,

47:23.174 --> 47:25.010
no matter what
he may pretend.

47:28.546 --> 47:30.181
My mother says the opposite.

47:35.020 --> 47:38.123
Was it her order to lock
my cousin in the Tower?

47:40.158 --> 47:41.459
Or was it yours?

47:41.559 --> 47:43.328
He is a York boy.

47:45.997 --> 47:47.832
They were calling for him,

47:47.933 --> 47:51.369
shouting that they would
support him over me.
What else could I do?

47:51.469 --> 47:54.805
You know the answer.

47:54.940 --> 47:57.943
If you want their love
then you should release him.

47:59.677 --> 48:02.047
Will you please allow
my mother from that room?

48:03.248 --> 48:05.550
I must assume
I cannot trust her.

48:05.650 --> 48:08.386
So I am to be
separated from her?

48:09.154 --> 48:12.523
Do you really think
she has your best interests
at heart, Lizzie?

48:18.529 --> 48:21.832
Teddy is no threat to you.
You know that in your heart.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.970
Of course he is a threat.
He is beloved.

48:26.704 --> 48:28.306
England hates me!

48:29.607 --> 48:30.808
You may be assured of that.

48:30.976 --> 48:33.311
The only hearts
I won on Progress
were due to you.

48:36.047 --> 48:38.249
They thanked me
for your actions.

48:38.783 --> 48:42.120
They fell down on their knees
and they praised me.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.029
I owe you my thanks.

48:58.003 --> 48:59.304
If only we could
work together,

48:59.404 --> 49:02.340
we could be a king
for England.

49:07.412 --> 49:09.347
But you hate me...

49:10.648 --> 49:12.317
and always will.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.698
Lovell has fled
to Burgundy.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.701
The Duchess is emboldened
by the news from Progress

49:30.801 --> 49:32.437
and has taken
three more ships.

49:32.537 --> 49:35.373
Burgundy has become
a rebel stronghold.

49:36.041 --> 49:38.276
- We will send an army.
- No.

49:40.245 --> 49:42.347
Not an army, Mother.
A peace envoy.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.683
We'll send my husband,
and his son Lord Strange.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.221
No.

49:51.256 --> 49:54.125
I will not deprive you
of your husband.

49:54.225 --> 49:55.326
It would be
too hard on you,

49:55.426 --> 49:57.528
after everything
you've done for me.

49:59.064 --> 50:01.532
Jasper may form the envoy
with Lord Strange.

50:01.632 --> 50:04.735
He doesn't have
a wife to miss him
or anyone to pine for.

50:06.204 --> 50:07.738
Marvelous.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.409
I couldn't face weeks
on the road and two rough
channel crossings.

50:21.686 --> 50:23.188
Did you punish her...

50:23.288 --> 50:24.622
for stealing the Palace gold?

50:24.722 --> 50:25.990
It will be a nice
trip for you.

50:26.091 --> 50:28.393
I never thought I'd live
to see Burgundy.

50:28.493 --> 50:30.128
I thanked her.

50:30.228 --> 50:32.563
I would go in your place,
but His Grace commands it.

50:43.841 --> 50:45.376
Did you ask him,
Lizzie?

50:45.476 --> 50:46.644
Did you ask?

50:46.744 --> 50:48.646
I'm sorry.
He will not release him.

50:50.915 --> 50:52.450
Well, may I visit him
at least?

50:52.550 --> 50:55.086
Not yet.
It will take time.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.223
But, Maggie,
I think I have learned a way

50:58.323 --> 51:00.225
to work my will on Henry.

51:00.325 --> 51:01.592
A way to help us win.

51:04.229 --> 51:06.397
I pray that he's a boy.

51:07.332 --> 51:09.834
Maybe when you've given
Henry a son and heir,

51:09.934 --> 51:11.802
he won't fear
poor Teddy anymore.

51:21.279 --> 51:23.314
Henry?

51:25.716 --> 51:28.018
There is something
that I would like to...

51:28.219 --> 51:29.754
Give me your hand.

51:37.162 --> 51:38.296
Kicking.

51:50.541 --> 51:52.543
You will submit
to your confinement.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.845
Until the child is born.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.481
A king may make
his own rules

51:56.581 --> 51:58.483
and elect to visit
if he so wishes.

51:58.583 --> 52:01.452
Only if he wishes to displease
the Holy Lord his God.

52:02.853 --> 52:05.022
Excitement stimulates
the womb.

52:05.190 --> 52:07.558
We cannot take a risk
with your heir.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.198
It will be
your choice, Henry.

52:29.214 --> 52:32.217
*
