00:01.134 --> 00:02.401
<i>[Dakota] We are back,
another road trip.</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:04.670
<i>You guys are gonna need
to put these blindfolds on.</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:07.039
- I'm actually scared.
- Where are we?

00:07.041 --> 00:08.841
When I walked in,

00:08.843 --> 00:11.610
<i>it's just a gut-wrenching
sadness.</i>

00:11.612 --> 00:13.879
<i>[Tanner] One hundred souls
lost their lives</i>

00:13.881 --> 00:15.581
<i>from negligence and accidents.</i>

00:15.583 --> 00:17.883
Can you please let us know
that we're not alone?

00:17.885 --> 00:20.019
<i>- [Ovilus] Enemy.
- Enemy.</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:21.353
Something feels weird
down there.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.722
What [bleep]. Holy [bleep].

00:23.724 --> 00:27.926
Something was telling me,
"You need to leave."

00:27.928 --> 00:29.628
<i>My name is Dakota Laden.</i>

00:29.630 --> 00:31.363
<i>I'm leading my sister</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.499
<i>and two best friends
on a road trip</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:36.535
<i>exploring the most haunted
locations in America.</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:38.904
[Chelsea screaming]
Oh, my God.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.940
[screaming]

00:43.710 --> 00:46.445
- Go, go, go, go.
- I'm freaked out.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.213
[Dakota]
<i>Experimenting with fear</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:49.882
<i>and how it affects
our interaction</i>

00:49.884 --> 00:51.450
<i>with the paranormal.</i>

00:51.452 --> 00:54.787
<i>Each night,
we separate and sleep alone.</i>

00:54.789 --> 00:58.857
<i>The catch is only one of us
knows where we're going.</i>

00:58.859 --> 01:01.960
[eerie music playing]

01:05.899 --> 01:09.835
[dramatic music playing]

01:23.650 --> 01:25.350
We are back.

01:25.352 --> 01:28.454
We are on the road again
for another road trip.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.788
It's only been a month

01:29.790 --> 01:32.091
since the last one
and this time,

01:32.093 --> 01:34.593
we will be traveling
to new frontiers,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.161
to new corners of the country

01:36.163 --> 01:37.830
that we've never
explored before.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.965
And some of the locations
I've picked

01:39.967 --> 01:42.734
have never been
investigated before either.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.003
Right now, we are in Montana

01:45.005 --> 01:48.307
headed to a haunted
abandoned orphanage.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.148
<i>This terrible place was home
to hundreds of children</i>

01:56.150 --> 01:58.050
<i>whose parents had either died,</i>

01:58.052 --> 01:59.852
<i>couldn't afford to care for them</i>

01:59.854 --> 02:02.221
<i>or even worse,
they just dumped them there,</i>

02:02.223 --> 02:03.989
<i>never to be retrieved again.</i>

02:03.991 --> 02:07.092
<i>What should've been
a place of love and care</i>

02:07.094 --> 02:09.161
<i>that protected
these vulnerable children</i>

02:09.163 --> 02:10.529
<i>was anything but.</i>

02:10.531 --> 02:12.264
<i>The abuse
that they suffered here</i>

02:12.266 --> 02:13.999
<i>was so severe</i>

02:14.001 --> 02:17.569
<i>that over a hundred kids died.</i>

02:17.571 --> 02:19.471
<i>And although there is said to be</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:22.374
<i>some child-like paranormal
energy still there,</i>

02:22.376 --> 02:24.910
<i>there are also reports
of a much darker,</i>

02:24.912 --> 02:26.645
<i>more malevolent presence</i>

02:26.647 --> 02:29.715
<i>that terrorizes those who enter.</i>

02:29.717 --> 02:31.884
<i>In the past,
we've explored the idea</i>

02:31.886 --> 02:34.353
that isolation intensifies fear.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.055
Our first spot
tragically is a place

02:37.057 --> 02:40.692
where the residents slowly
and devastatingly realized

02:40.694 --> 02:42.528
that nobody was coming
to save them

02:42.530 --> 02:46.231
and the fear that they felt
must've been agonizing.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.033
I'm gonna take
this one step further

02:48.035 --> 02:50.402
and explore why being alone

02:50.404 --> 02:52.371
causes us to be so afraid.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.174
[dramatic music playing]

03:01.915 --> 03:03.582
- [cheering]
- Whoa. Wow.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.651
[Chelsea] This is gorgeous.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.985
[Dakota] Yeah, it's beautiful.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.754
It's a good place to start

03:08.756 --> 03:10.422
a very terrifying road trip.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.724
Oh, yeah. That part too.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.059
I know every road trip
is different

03:14.061 --> 03:15.260
and they're very unpredictable

03:15.262 --> 03:16.828
but do you guys have any goals

03:16.830 --> 03:18.797
or any just things
you wanna try to achieve

03:18.799 --> 03:20.699
- on this road trip?
- I'd like to push myself

03:20.701 --> 03:22.301
a little bit farther, you know.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.770
Try to explore
a little bit deeper.

03:24.772 --> 03:25.971
A personal goal
that I think could be,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.105
like, a team goal is just

03:27.107 --> 03:29.141
to push ourselves creatively

03:29.143 --> 03:31.710
and not be so traditional.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.712
I think what you guys
were saying is on point,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.914
like, we do need to continue
to push ourselves.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.917
<i>We believe that being alone
intensifies your fear,</i>

03:38.919 --> 03:41.320
but I wanna explore
why being alone

03:41.322 --> 03:43.555
makes us so afraid,
what brings that.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.591
Oh, that kind of sucks.
[laughs]

03:47.126 --> 03:48.927
You know,
while the sun is still up,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.462
I do wanna go see

03:50.464 --> 03:52.564
some of the breathtaking views
of Montana.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.767
So we are going off-roading
up a mountain.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.603
- No way, what?
- That's so cool.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.472
Oh, my gosh,
a bunch of Midwesterners

04:00.474 --> 04:02.374
going off-roading
in the mountains.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.942
What could go wrong? [laughs]

04:03.944 --> 04:07.279
[upbeat music playing]

04:07.281 --> 04:09.314
- [Alex] Let's go.
- All right. Ready?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.316
[engine revving]

04:12.418 --> 04:13.418
- You know what, Dakota?
- What?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.454
I really try to avoid
these situations

04:15.456 --> 04:16.855
where my life is in your hands.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.458
I'm nervous and,
well, we got this.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.294
[Chelsea laughs] Oh, my God.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.096
[Tanner]
You're gonna eat our dust.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.334
My God. [laughs]

04:29.336 --> 04:32.404
[upbeat music playing]

04:35.875 --> 04:38.944
[laughter]

04:38.946 --> 04:40.145
Slow down, Tanner.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.515
Holy [bleep].

04:43.517 --> 04:45.517
Yeah.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.719
- Oh, my God, big dip.
- Big dip.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.656
Whoa.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.392
Yeah. [bleep]

04:53.394 --> 04:55.727
Holy crap, this is fast.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.666
My gosh, it looks so beautiful.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.535
I can't even believe it.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.237
- [bleep]
- Sup bro?

05:05.239 --> 05:08.674
- Yeah.
- Eat that dust. Eat it.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.710
[upbeat music playing]

05:15.481 --> 05:18.016
That was an absolute blast,
I mean, that reminded me

05:18.018 --> 05:19.918
of when we used to whip around
with those things

05:19.920 --> 05:22.020
around my yard
and just go cruising.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.789
You had this farm
and we would just

05:23.791 --> 05:26.258
rip around in the mud,
through the trees and stuff.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.227
Imagine if we didn't have
those childhood memories

05:29.229 --> 05:32.097
and imagine if we didn't have
each other growing up,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.865
how difficult
that would've been.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.500
Well, that's sad.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.869
Childhood memories
and making memories like that

05:37.871 --> 05:39.938
has a lot to do
with our haunted location.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.573
It's always good to step back

05:41.575 --> 05:43.275
and appreciate what you have

05:43.277 --> 05:44.543
and what you grew up with,

05:44.545 --> 05:46.611
but this is a really strange way

05:46.613 --> 05:48.580
- to do that, Dakota.
- Yeah, I know.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.748
You pulled a 180 on us.

05:49.750 --> 05:53.018
[suspenseful music playing]

05:53.020 --> 05:55.387
We're about five minutes
from the spot,

05:55.389 --> 05:57.389
but before we get there,

05:57.391 --> 06:00.058
you guys are gonna need
to put these blindfolds on.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.461
- Why?
- It makes sense, trust me.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.296
I don't want you guys to see

06:04.298 --> 06:06.498
where we're about to go do
the packet read.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.134
So I'm gonna guide you guys
all out one by one.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.002
Chels, here you go.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.771
This is ridiculous.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.807
[eerie music playing]

06:20.346 --> 06:22.814
All right, Chels,
I'm taking you out first.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.183
We'll see you guys in a sec,
I'm coming back for you.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.987
Dakota, I am...
I'm actually scared.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.189
This is freaking me out.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.493
Okay. That sounded creepy.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.660
- [exhales]
- [creaks]

06:35.662 --> 06:36.895
Whoa.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.831
[Dakota] Here we go.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.133
There's a chair.

06:41.135 --> 06:44.936
- See you, Chels.
- Oh, my God.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.845
I don't understand
what's going on.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.180
- Do you wanna go next?
- No.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.282
- What? Come on.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.650
All right. Ready?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.585
[both] Rock, paper, scissors.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.521
- What did you get?
- I did scissors.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.490
- What did you get?
- I did rock.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.858
[bleep]

07:06.860 --> 07:07.993
Yup. You're next.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.861
All right.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.897
- [screams]
- [bleep]

07:11.899 --> 07:13.632
- [laughs] What's up, guys?
- Nothing.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.033
[Dakota] All right.
Who should I take next?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.235
- [Tanner] Alex.
- All right.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.572
Oh, my God.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.274
Where, uh, where are we?

07:22.276 --> 07:24.342
- [Dakota] Follow me.
- [Alex] Okay.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.582
All right.
I put a walkie on the ground

07:30.584 --> 07:32.551
by your left foot.
I'll see you, dude.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.454
I am going to get Dakota back
so good for this.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.990
Dude, this is so weird.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.659
[Dakota] Okay. We're in.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.828
Come around here.
There, it's a tiny chair.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.863
Okay. Oh, yeah. What the hell?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.398
I'm gonna go to my location now

07:46.400 --> 07:47.732
and once I get set,

07:47.734 --> 07:49.167
I'm gonna come
through the walkie

07:49.169 --> 07:51.236
and at that point,
everyone will be able

07:51.238 --> 07:53.138
- to take their blindfolds off.
- All right. See you, dude.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.174
[suspenseful music playing]

07:58.544 --> 07:59.911
All right, you guys.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.580
- What the [bleep].
<i>- This is Dakota</i>

08:01.582 --> 08:04.783
and you can officially
take your blindfolds off.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.318
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.954
- Oh, my God.
- Where am I?

08:08.956 --> 08:12.390
Okay.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.092
If you guys look
under your feet,

08:14.094 --> 08:16.027
<i>you should see a packet.</i>

08:18.598 --> 08:19.764
Open up your packet.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.066
All right.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.434
Here we go.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.737
- Twin...
- Bridges...

08:25.739 --> 08:26.972
Orphanage?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.875
Is this where we are right now?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.977
- Yes.
- Dude, this is messed up.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.778
I wanted to try a different way

08:33.780 --> 08:35.981
of reading the packet
and I decided

08:35.983 --> 08:37.983
<i>we're gonna read it here,
tonight</i>

08:37.985 --> 08:39.117
<i>at the haunted location.</i>

08:39.119 --> 08:40.886
We're staying

08:40.888 --> 08:42.654
at the orphanage tonight?

08:42.656 --> 08:46.258
- Yes.
- What the hell, Dakota?

08:46.260 --> 08:48.894
All right. Well, Alex,
how about you start us off?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.929
Okay. Here we go.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.299
<i>Nestled in a basin</i>

08:54.301 --> 08:56.735
<i>between the majestic
Montana Mountains</i>

08:56.737 --> 08:59.070
<i>in the winding Beaverhead River</i>

08:59.072 --> 09:01.006
<i>is the behemoth property</i>

09:01.008 --> 09:03.808
<i>of the former
Twin Bridges orphanage,</i>

09:03.810 --> 09:05.477
<i>20 buildings spread out</i>

09:05.479 --> 09:07.846
<i>over 100 acres</i>

09:07.848 --> 09:11.516
<i>that now lay idle and forgotten.</i>

09:11.518 --> 09:14.185
<i>[John] I was put in the home
when I was five months old</i>

09:14.187 --> 09:17.022
<i>and I lived there
until I was 12.</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:19.791
It was a place that really

09:19.793 --> 09:23.695
should've been a safe haven,
it wasn't.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.431
<i>[Alex] The children
would work the property,</i>

09:26.433 --> 09:28.833
<i>operating the onsite barn,</i>

09:28.835 --> 09:31.503
<i>butcher shop, and steam plant,</i>

09:31.505 --> 09:35.607
<i>sometimes starting
as young as six years old.</i>

09:35.609 --> 09:37.943
<i>It was kind of like
a little community.</i>

09:37.945 --> 09:40.178
<i>The kids went out
and worked the farms.</i>

09:40.180 --> 09:42.881
The girls sewed.
They made their own clothes.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.784
- They did everything.
<i>- [Chelsea] The facility hit</i>

09:45.786 --> 09:49.120
<i>peak capacity
during The Great Depression</i>

09:49.122 --> 09:51.456
<i>with 300 children</i>

09:51.458 --> 09:54.192
<i>living on site.</i>

09:54.194 --> 09:56.695
<i>When children were admitted
to the orphanage,</i>

09:56.697 --> 09:59.164
<i>they would be separated
into cottages</i>

09:59.166 --> 10:02.200
based on their age and gender.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.935
Ripped from their siblings

10:03.937 --> 10:05.804
and forbidden to see them

10:05.806 --> 10:08.974
<i>except for one hour on Sundays.</i>

10:08.976 --> 10:10.775
This place sounds
messed up already.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.712
<i>Could you imagine
you already lost your family</i>

10:13.714 --> 10:15.714
and now they won't even
let you talk

10:15.716 --> 10:17.682
- to your siblings?
- That's really sad.

10:17.684 --> 10:21.453
<i>Each cottage was overseen
by a matron,</i>

10:21.455 --> 10:24.990
<i>a housemother who was there
to keep things in line</i>

10:24.992 --> 10:27.058
<i>and dole out discipline.</i>

10:27.060 --> 10:29.961
The caretakers were just there
for the job,

10:29.963 --> 10:32.497
they showed no love
towards the children.

10:32.499 --> 10:36.134
They were told every day,
"Your parents hated you

10:36.136 --> 10:39.004
and that's why they put you
in this place."

10:39.006 --> 10:41.306
At this point, you guys probably

10:41.308 --> 10:43.808
are starting to understand
the conversation that we had.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.311
This is definitely a place
where the children

10:46.313 --> 10:48.980
<i>unfortunately did not have
good memories.</i>

10:48.982 --> 10:50.949
What is wrong with this place?

10:50.951 --> 10:53.952
All right, Tanner,
you can read the next part.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.321
<i>[Tanner] Former residents
have told stories</i>

10:56.323 --> 10:57.856
<i>of the abuse they suffered</i>

10:57.858 --> 10:58.990
<i>during the early years</i>

10:58.992 --> 11:01.026
<i>of the orphanage's tenure.</i>

11:01.028 --> 11:03.094
I remember my father telling me

11:03.096 --> 11:06.665
that they put him in a closet
under the stairs

11:06.667 --> 11:08.266
<i>because he did not eat
his dinner</i>

11:08.268 --> 11:11.269
<i>and he spent a lot of times
in that closet.</i>

11:11.271 --> 11:14.339
The old matron,
she would whip kids

11:14.341 --> 11:16.374
<i>until she was exhausted</i>

11:16.376 --> 11:18.576
<i>and I would bite my cheeks</i>

11:18.578 --> 11:21.513
to keep from crying.

11:21.515 --> 11:25.050
The only thing that exceeded
her cruelty

11:25.052 --> 11:27.185
was my hatred for her.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.088
<i>[Tanner] In the end,
100 souls lost their lives</i>

11:30.090 --> 11:33.558
<i>from negligence, disease,
and accidents.</i>

11:35.695 --> 11:38.196
Though the majority
of the buildings onsite

11:38.198 --> 11:41.032
have been unoccupied
since the 1970s,

11:41.034 --> 11:43.568
the orphanage is anything
but empty.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.572
The most active areas
include the gymnasium.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.608
<i>Many people report seeing
large groups of children</i>

11:50.610 --> 11:53.111
<i>playing in and around
this building</i>

11:53.113 --> 11:55.580
<i>who then suddenly disappear.</i>

11:55.582 --> 11:58.750
<i>Balls and rocks spontaneously
move throughout this area</i>

11:58.752 --> 12:01.119
<i>even when there is no wind.</i>

12:01.121 --> 12:03.121
And that, you guys,
is the building

12:03.123 --> 12:04.756
I am in right now.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.525
I am in the gymnasium,
in the pool.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.461
<i>Tanner,
you can read the next one.</i>

12:09.463 --> 12:10.795
The school,

12:12.398 --> 12:15.400
<i>located directly next
to the gymnasium,</i>

12:15.402 --> 12:17.936
<i>disembodied gruff voices</i>

12:17.938 --> 12:20.438
<i>and heavy footsteps
can be heard,</i>

12:20.440 --> 12:23.174
<i>and objects appear to move
on their own.</i>

12:23.176 --> 12:24.576
<i>[Carissa] I don't even like
to be in there.</i>

12:24.578 --> 12:27.645
It's a coldness
that just goes to your core.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.248
And I'm assuming
that's where I'm at right now.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.851
Yes. That is exactly
where you are.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.452
I've never liked school.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.989
<i>The high girls' cottage,</i>

12:37.991 --> 12:40.358
<i>this was just
one of the buildings</i>

12:40.360 --> 12:42.660
<i>where children
were housed on site</i>

12:42.662 --> 12:45.463
<i>after being separated
from their siblings,</i>

12:45.465 --> 12:48.233
this has never been explored

12:48.235 --> 12:49.934
<i>by a paranormal team.</i>

12:49.936 --> 12:52.637
And Chelsea,
that is where you are.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.906
Great.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.475
Okay. Alex, your turn to read.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.110
The Castle,

13:00.846 --> 13:02.847
<i>also known as the Victorian.</i>

13:02.849 --> 13:06.050
<i>This was the main building
and the first constructed</i>

13:06.052 --> 13:07.585
<i>for the orphanage.</i>

13:07.587 --> 13:09.754
<i>People report seeing
the small faces</i>

13:09.756 --> 13:11.723
<i>of hopeful children peering out</i>

13:11.725 --> 13:13.525
<i>of the building's windows</i>

13:13.527 --> 13:15.827
<i>and hearing them sing
haunting melodies.</i>

13:15.829 --> 13:18.730
<i>When I walk in
or even on the steps,</i>

13:18.732 --> 13:22.801
it's just a gut-wrenching
sadness.

13:22.803 --> 13:26.171
<i>A matron can be seen
staring out the window</i>

13:26.173 --> 13:28.740
<i>and one can feel her eyes
watching you</i>

13:28.742 --> 13:32.043
as you walk the property,
but it's the bottom floor

13:32.045 --> 13:34.612
that has the most
negative paranormal energy

13:34.614 --> 13:36.815
<i>on the entire property.</i>

13:36.817 --> 13:38.516
<i>[Lisa] I was walking around
the building</i>

13:38.518 --> 13:40.685
<i>and my body went
into fight or flight mode.</i>

13:40.687 --> 13:42.353
I started getting
a little bit lightheaded

13:42.355 --> 13:43.755
and a little dizzy.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.356
<i>Something definitely
was in there</i>

13:45.358 --> 13:48.393
that was telling me,
"You need to leave."

13:50.696 --> 13:52.831
And Alex, that is where you are.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.566
You're not only in the Castle

13:54.568 --> 13:56.401
<i>but you are on the bottom floor.</i>

13:56.403 --> 13:59.470
I figured because
this looks like a basement.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.306
- What do you guys think?
- So far,

14:01.308 --> 14:03.741
I am not a big fan
of your plan, Dakota.

14:03.743 --> 14:04.876
I agree with Alex.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.178
Do I get to see you guys soon?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.413
So here's the thing,

14:08.415 --> 14:11.249
tonight we are starting alone.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.752
So we are going to remain
in our areas

14:14.754 --> 14:16.387
in the buildings that we're in.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.424
<i>And then around midnight,
we will meet up.</i>

14:19.426 --> 14:21.593
This is like
some sick joke, right?

14:21.595 --> 14:24.262
Nothing about this location
is standard

14:24.264 --> 14:27.532
and this was a place that was
plagued with loneliness.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.033
So we're gonna start alone.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.568
I don't like that one bit.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.637
Are you kidding me?

14:35.407 --> 14:37.775
[eerie music playing]

14:45.751 --> 14:47.118
All right.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.721
I guess this is where
I'm staying alone

14:49.723 --> 14:51.389
for the next few hours.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.193
I am in the high women's
cottage.

14:55.195 --> 14:59.297
I am not mentally
or physically prepared

14:59.299 --> 15:02.100
for this decision. [sighs]

15:04.436 --> 15:06.971
So I am now turning on
the Ovilus.

15:06.973 --> 15:10.108
<i>The Ovilus is a device
that has a word database.</i>

15:10.110 --> 15:12.477
If there's anything here,
you can use this device

15:12.479 --> 15:15.013
and select the words
that you want.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.248
Is there anyone here with me?

15:17.250 --> 15:21.286
What was it like
living in the orphanage?

15:23.055 --> 15:27.025
If there's someone here,
who are you?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.260
<i>[Ovilus] Ann.</i>

15:29.262 --> 15:32.864
Whoa. It just said
the word "Ann."

15:32.866 --> 15:35.967
Am I speaking to Ann?

15:35.969 --> 15:38.636
Okay, Ann,
if I am talking to you,

15:38.638 --> 15:40.905
are you a child?

15:40.907 --> 15:42.774
Are you a worker?

15:42.776 --> 15:45.777
Who are you, Ann?

15:48.013 --> 15:50.081
Did you make friends here?

15:50.083 --> 15:53.751
Did you feel fulfilled here?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.420
<i>[Ovilus] Harriet.</i>

15:56.922 --> 15:59.857
Oh, my gosh.
It just said "Harriet."

15:59.859 --> 16:02.360
The Ovilus has given me
two words,

16:02.362 --> 16:04.028
Ann and Harriet.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.731
Those are the names of girls.

16:06.733 --> 16:10.201
I've never heard the Ovilus
say those names before.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.504
Ann and Harriet,
were you two friends?

16:13.506 --> 16:16.174
Were you children here?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.543
Did you work here?

16:24.416 --> 16:26.217
[sighs]

16:29.555 --> 16:30.989
[Dakota] Oh, it's so cold.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.224
I'm gonna go inside
the gymnasium building

16:33.226 --> 16:36.794
where the windows are intact
and it's not near as cold.

16:42.234 --> 16:45.903
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.242
Right now, I'm gonna go
to the locker room

16:51.244 --> 16:55.246
and just settle down
and ask some questions.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.415
I did bring
the music box with me.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.751
<i>This is a device
that picks up motion.</i>

16:59.753 --> 17:01.619
I'm gonna set this
on the floor in front of me

17:01.621 --> 17:04.155
and see if I can get any
of the children who are here

17:04.157 --> 17:06.791
to come and play with it.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.060
If there are any children
that can hear me,

17:09.062 --> 17:10.895
you can play with this device.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.397
You can play with the music box.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.065
I brought it here for you.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.867
I don't want you
to be afraid of me,

17:15.869 --> 17:17.502
afraid of my presence.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.477
I don't wanna be here at all.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.213
There's so much noise
going on right now.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.383
It sounds like this building
is falling apart.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.620
Like, I really don't even know
if that's safe or not.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.655
Is there someone down here?

17:39.358 --> 17:42.226
<i>Can you talk to me
through this device?</i>

17:42.228 --> 17:44.128
Tell me who you are.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.030
What do you want?

17:50.469 --> 17:54.072
- [cracks]
- What the [bleep] was that?

17:54.074 --> 17:56.207
- [footsteps]
- What the [bleep].

17:56.209 --> 17:58.409
What the [bleep].

18:00.079 --> 18:02.914
What the hell?

18:10.789 --> 18:12.957
God, I don't know
what the hell that was.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.561
But it sounded like something
was about to just rush me.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.799
- [cracks]
- What the [bleep] was that?

18:21.801 --> 18:24.469
- [footsteps]
- What the [bleep] what the...

18:24.471 --> 18:26.471
If there's something down here

18:26.473 --> 18:28.139
that's trying to intimidate me,

18:28.141 --> 18:30.007
talk to me through this device.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.243
Say something to me
through this.

18:37.683 --> 18:40.685
[eerie music playing]

18:46.325 --> 18:48.025
I would love it
if one of the children

18:48.027 --> 18:50.228
or any of the children
came in here

18:50.230 --> 18:52.363
and played with this
box on the ground.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.432
If you just go up
in front of it...

18:55.901 --> 18:57.568
it'll play music.

19:07.246 --> 19:11.382
- [music box beeps]
- Oh, it just went off twice.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.750
[makes sound]

19:12.752 --> 19:15.753
There is something
in here with me.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.689
If I'm talking to a male, a boy,

19:18.691 --> 19:21.225
can you make
the music box go off?

19:25.297 --> 19:26.697
Okay.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.100
If I'm talking to a girl,
a female,

19:29.102 --> 19:31.669
can you make
the music box go off?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.205
- [music box beeps]
- Right when I asked it to.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.440
The music box
just went off twice.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.709
Thank you.
If you liked this place,

19:38.711 --> 19:40.278
if you liked the orphanage,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.980
can you make
the music box go off?

19:44.483 --> 19:45.917
It sounds like you didn't like

19:45.919 --> 19:48.085
your experiences here.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.887
If I'm right
and you didn't enjoy

19:49.889 --> 19:51.222
your experiences here,

19:51.224 --> 19:53.257
if you did not like
the orphanage,

19:53.259 --> 19:55.693
can you make
the music box go off?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.795
- [music box beeps]
- Right there.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.900
Thank you so much.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.569
Do you like the gymnasium?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.204
Is that why you're still here?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.240
- [music box beeps]
- Yes?

20:10.275 --> 20:11.509
Oh. I have the chills,

20:11.511 --> 20:14.278
like, this is so, so weird.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.781
I feel like this is something
positive and friendly

20:16.783 --> 20:19.250
but there is a very dark,
malevolent presence here

20:19.252 --> 20:21.619
that is said to follow people
throughout the property.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.957
It's definitely good
to not let my guard down.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.861
Is there anybody here with me?

20:30.863 --> 20:33.397
Can you give me
some sort of sign

20:33.399 --> 20:35.199
that I'm not alone?

20:39.771 --> 20:42.607
- [coughs]
- Holy [bleep].

20:42.609 --> 20:44.742
I've heard coughing
outside this room.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.213
[Tanner] Hello?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.218
Holy [bleep]
hold on, I'm gonna grab this.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.289
Hello?

20:58.291 --> 21:00.291
Is someone out there?

21:04.663 --> 21:06.664
- [coughs]
- Holy [bleep].

21:08.467 --> 21:10.101
- [coughs]
- Holy [bleep].

21:10.103 --> 21:12.503
I just heard coughing

21:12.505 --> 21:14.672
or some type of voice.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.641
Can you do that again?

21:19.945 --> 21:22.480
I have no idea
where that came from.

21:24.549 --> 21:26.217
Is there someone here?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.654
Are you okay?

21:34.426 --> 21:36.360
All right. I've walked
this entire building,

21:36.362 --> 21:38.963
I can't pinpoint
where that cough came from.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.131
It's like it's dead sound.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.699
It's almost like a child

21:41.701 --> 21:43.200
feels like he's gonna get
in trouble

21:43.202 --> 21:45.336
if I find him
so he's running away from me.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.271
I think I'm just gonna go back
to my original room

21:47.273 --> 21:50.608
and just stop
chasing this thing.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.677
[sighs]

21:52.679 --> 21:54.278
[Dakota]
<i>We've all been separated</i>

21:54.280 --> 21:55.613
<i>for a couple hours now.</i>

21:55.615 --> 21:56.847
<i>I think I'm gonna wrap things up</i>

21:56.849 --> 21:58.582
<i>and get on with the night.</i>

21:58.584 --> 22:00.618
<i>If you guys want,
you can wrap it up right now.</i>

22:00.620 --> 22:03.287
<i>I think we should be done
with the alone part.</i>

22:05.057 --> 22:06.324
All right. We're back.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.693
That was absolutely
a terrifying way

22:08.695 --> 22:10.895
- to start off the night.
- Dude, that was awful.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.930
No joke.
Something is down there, dark.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.099
I just felt like someone
was standing next to me,

22:15.101 --> 22:16.500
watching me the whole time,

22:16.502 --> 22:17.902
just listening
to what I was saying,

22:17.904 --> 22:18.969
and just watching.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.271
Screw that.

22:20.273 --> 22:22.973
<i>[Chelsea] Oh, my gosh.</i>

22:22.975 --> 22:24.975
I think for the rest
of the night

22:24.977 --> 22:28.446
that we should tackle
this place in duos.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.815
Thank God, we're in pairs now.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.817
[Dakota] Tanner, if you wanna
explore with me,

22:32.819 --> 22:35.686
and then Alex and Chelsea,
you guys go explore together.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.421
All right.
Let's do this, Chels.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.657
Bye. See you later.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.792
Oh, I need my flashlight
out there.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.461
Yeah. So, my partner
right there

22:43.463 --> 22:46.030
forgetting vital materials.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.565
- See you guys.
- Oh, sorry, Al.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.900
- [chuckles]
- [Alex] See what I mean?

22:49.902 --> 22:51.869
[laughter]

22:51.871 --> 22:53.571
[Chelsea] Oh, my gosh.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.240
Why couldn't they put
these buildings closer?

22:56.242 --> 22:57.808
It is freezing out here.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.410
What the hell are we doing?

22:59.412 --> 23:00.845
[Chelsea]
I wanna see the Castle.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.147
I know you spent
a lot of time there already

23:03.149 --> 23:05.015
but I've heard it's one
of the most haunted spots

23:05.017 --> 23:06.584
at this whole location.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.219
Oh, there it is.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.287
Spooky.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.524
<i>[Dakota] Tanner's has got
the thermal camera</i>

23:13.526 --> 23:15.326
<i>rolling as well,
we'll have that.</i>

23:15.328 --> 23:17.094
The thermals worked for us
in the past.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.362
[Tanner] Yeah.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.563
Let's test this thing out again,

23:19.565 --> 23:21.565
see if we get anything.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.769
[Dakota]
This is the gymnasium.

23:24.771 --> 23:28.172
[Tanner] This is it? Oh, man.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.074
[Dakota] This is where people
have reported to see

23:30.076 --> 23:34.412
large groups of children
playing in the gymnasium,

23:34.414 --> 23:36.213
outside of it.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.520
[exhales]

23:42.522 --> 23:45.823
Dang, this is where I was
for the packet read.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.324
That's so crazy.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.693
- Dude, there's no ceiling.
- [Dakota] No.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.796
[Tanner]
There's barely anything.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.934
Dude, this place is already
giving me the creeps.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.904
Whoa.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.272
Yeah. We probably shouldn't go

24:01.274 --> 24:02.740
more than a couple feet
into the gym

24:02.742 --> 24:05.042
because the floor
is falling apart.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.144
And, uh, yeah,
that could be really bad.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.312
We could die.

24:10.148 --> 24:13.851
If there's anybody here,
can you say something to us?

24:17.088 --> 24:20.324
Can you go to the center
of the gym and show yourself?

24:20.326 --> 24:22.893
We have something
that should be able

24:22.895 --> 24:24.495
to see you.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.136
[Tanner] Oh, there's nothing
out of the ordinary, man.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.604
All normal.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.606
[Dakota] I do wanna go
to the locker room.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.608
I spent some time
in there earlier.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.443
And I'm almost positive
I was talking

24:39.445 --> 24:42.046
to a little girl
and I wanna go back.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.082
I wanna try to follow up
and communicate more.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.805
Okay. That wind
is absolutely ridiculous.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.640
Like, I feel like
I keep hearing things

25:09.642 --> 25:11.208
but I don't know
if it's the wind,

25:11.210 --> 25:13.544
like, just rocking this house.

25:23.388 --> 25:25.823
This is a really
small room, it's...

25:25.825 --> 25:27.458
[Chelsea] It's super small.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.760
It makes you really sad
how small the...

25:40.005 --> 25:41.238
- [door shuts]
- Whoa!

25:42.374 --> 25:44.708
[eerie music playing]

25:50.181 --> 25:51.515
- [door shuts]
- Whoa!

25:51.517 --> 25:54.084
- [Alex] Oh.
- What the [bleep]

25:54.086 --> 25:55.653
It's so bad.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.454
[Alex] The wind just pushed
the door shut.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.790
Okay. Wind or not,

25:59.792 --> 26:01.959
that was terrifying.

26:01.961 --> 26:05.596
Okay. That was not
what I needed.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.031
[Alex] No.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.767
[Chelsea] Oh, my gosh,
that was so loud.

26:09.769 --> 26:13.504
I mean, the one thing
that I am terrified of hearing

26:13.506 --> 26:16.473
is the singing that people
hear in this building.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.609
- [door shuts]
- Oh, what the [bleep]

26:18.611 --> 26:20.578
- I hate this place.
- [laughs]

26:20.580 --> 26:22.846
I love that it's not me.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.215
All right.
Let's go, like, downstairs.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.121
I'm rolling
on the digital recorder.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.491
I'm gonna set this right here
in front of me.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.427
<i>We have something
that will be able</i>

26:36.429 --> 26:38.429
<i>to record your voice.</i>

26:38.431 --> 26:40.798
So if you talk right now,
we can hear you.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.467
When I was in here earlier,

26:43.469 --> 26:44.635
I thought I was talking

26:44.637 --> 26:47.271
with possibly a little girl.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.608
Can you tell me your name
and who you are?

26:54.379 --> 26:55.813
Is there anything
you would've liked

26:55.815 --> 26:59.450
to have said to your family?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.027
<i>Is there anything
you would've liked</i>

27:10.029 --> 27:12.930
<i>to have said to your family?</i>

27:15.834 --> 27:19.169
<i>Alright, I'm going to cut
on the digital recorder.</i>

27:19.171 --> 27:20.871
Nothing.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.673
We got nothing on the recorder.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.208
Mmm.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.509
I know there's something here.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.011
I know there's a child here,

27:27.013 --> 27:28.379
at least... at least one.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.680
I mean, for all we know,

27:29.682 --> 27:31.315
it was just
uncomfortable with us.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.318
- [Dakota] Yeah.
- Didn't wanna talk.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.587
Can you believe how sad
this place is, man?

27:36.589 --> 27:38.756
And this is beyond upsetting.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.091
Just the fact of the matter
that we're dealing with kids

27:41.093 --> 27:42.593
that were separated
from their families

27:42.595 --> 27:44.328
is just tough.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.263
Like, you don't expect
to lose your family

27:46.265 --> 27:47.965
- unless it's death.
- [Tanner] Mmm-hmm.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.467
And to lose your family,
knowing that they're still

27:50.469 --> 27:52.403
here on Earth living?

27:52.405 --> 27:53.737
Even if you have a sibling here,

27:53.739 --> 27:55.205
you're separated
and you don't get

27:55.207 --> 27:57.741
- to see them, like...
- That's just cruel.

27:57.743 --> 28:01.745
To know that I'm only
100 ft away from my sister

28:01.747 --> 28:04.081
and I'm not allowed
to talk to her,

28:04.083 --> 28:06.283
my goodness, man.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.951
[sighs]

28:16.594 --> 28:19.229
[Alex] Are we talking
to a child right now?

28:19.231 --> 28:20.631
Or is this something else?

28:20.633 --> 28:22.132
<i>Is this the matron?</i>

28:22.134 --> 28:25.302
<i>Is this something darker?</i>

28:25.304 --> 28:28.572
Who is in this room with us?

28:28.574 --> 28:30.808
What are you?

28:34.412 --> 28:36.880
I don't know
what to think, like...

28:36.882 --> 28:38.982
We're getting
nothing on the Ovilus.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.484
<i>[Ovilus] Friend.</i>

28:40.486 --> 28:42.219
- Dude!
- [Alex] What?

28:42.221 --> 28:44.421
- [Chelsea] It said friend.
- [Alex] Friend?

28:44.423 --> 28:46.857
We've been sitting here
waiting for an answer

28:46.859 --> 28:50.527
on who is in this room
and it said "friend."

28:50.529 --> 28:53.230
This is such a different
experience up here

28:53.232 --> 28:56.366
- than I had in the basement.
- Maybe we were...

28:57.535 --> 28:59.303
It said girl.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.672
- [Alex] It said girl?
- [Chelsea] Yeah.

29:01.674 --> 29:05.008
Like, I wonder if you being
in the room, Chelsea,

29:05.010 --> 29:07.945
like this little girl
is so much more comfortable

29:07.947 --> 29:09.379
showing who she is.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.448
Maybe she followed me
from the girls' cottage.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.850
She could have.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.052
I mean, you know,
if you think about it,

29:15.054 --> 29:17.187
these people were separated
from their siblings.

29:17.189 --> 29:21.825
It easily could be that you
remind her of her sister.

29:21.827 --> 29:25.696
I know, like, even something
as simple as us being alone

29:25.698 --> 29:28.699
for a few hours,
isolated by ourselves

29:28.701 --> 29:31.835
when we got put in duos,
I was like so pumped.

29:31.837 --> 29:34.538
I feel like humankind
is meant to be together

29:34.540 --> 29:37.307
and it's meant to be
surrounded by people.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.814
- Wow.
<i>- [Ovilus] Hide.</i>

29:43.816 --> 29:45.449
- Alex?
- [Alex] Yeah?

29:45.451 --> 29:48.318
I'm not kidding, the Ovilus
just told us to hide.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.188
[Alex] I wonder is this girl
trying to warn us

29:51.190 --> 29:54.224
about the dark entity
that's in this...

29:54.226 --> 29:56.059
<i>- [Ovilus] Enemy.
- What?</i>

29:56.061 --> 29:57.828
- Enemy, enemy.
- [Alex] No.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.964
It said "hide"
and then "enemy."

30:00.966 --> 30:03.433
I was actually feeling
so comfortable

30:03.435 --> 30:04.935
until that just happened.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.838
And now I have chills
running down my spine.

30:09.841 --> 30:11.542
Hello?

30:13.144 --> 30:15.312
Like, I'm almost wondering
if you're right,

30:15.314 --> 30:19.616
if someone followed you
from the high girls' cottage

30:19.618 --> 30:21.552
just to warn us about this.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.655
It went from something
really friendly

30:24.657 --> 30:27.791
to I just feel like
we should get out of this.

30:27.793 --> 30:29.359
[Alex] I think we should, too.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.894
[Chelsea]
Let's get out of here.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.299
You showed me around your spot.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.201
I'll show you around
where I spent

30:37.203 --> 30:38.435
the majority of my night.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.703
[Alex] I don't know why,

30:39.705 --> 30:41.338
but I just have a really,

30:41.340 --> 30:44.208
really bad feeling.

30:45.076 --> 30:47.411
[eerie music playing]

30:51.249 --> 30:55.252
So Tanner and I are headed
to the school right now.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.626
[Tanner]
Welcome to the school.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.428
This is freaky.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.798
This is one of the most
active areas

31:07.800 --> 31:09.600
on the property.

31:09.602 --> 31:12.135
So you were in here
for three hours.

31:12.137 --> 31:16.006
I heard coughing loud enough
to get me out of that room.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.042
Was it a girl? Was it a guy?
Could you tell?

31:19.044 --> 31:21.078
To be honest with you,
if I had to pick one,

31:21.080 --> 31:22.412
it would be a girl for sure.

31:27.185 --> 31:30.020
Is there anybody here with us?

31:30.022 --> 31:33.190
If there's a child
who can hear my voice,

31:33.192 --> 31:35.592
can you speak out loud to us?

31:40.265 --> 31:41.598
[Tanner]
It's like the science room.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.900
[Dakota] Okay.

31:44.102 --> 31:45.335
Can you please let us know

31:45.337 --> 31:46.703
that we're not alone?

31:46.705 --> 31:48.605
Can you make a noise?

31:52.777 --> 31:54.611
Where in the school
did you hear the coughing?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.880
Was it on the second floor
or was it on the first floor?

31:56.882 --> 31:58.248
I heard the coughing
on the first floor.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.883
- First floor.
- The first room

31:59.885 --> 32:01.618
that you put me in,
I heard coughing

32:01.620 --> 32:03.420
outside the hallway.
And I couldn't figure out

32:03.422 --> 32:05.889
- where it came from.
- Do you wanna go down there

32:05.891 --> 32:07.724
and just put it to the test?

32:07.726 --> 32:09.293
Let's try that experiment
you were talking about.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.261
Yeah, I'll set that up
down there.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.930
I got a good experiment,
something I've been

32:12.932 --> 32:15.065
wanting to try for a long time.

32:17.635 --> 32:20.737
So I have brought
a bunch of balloons with me

32:20.739 --> 32:22.773
and some string.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.643
<i>I wanna hang them from a wall</i>

32:26.645 --> 32:28.779
so that there's a couple
of them dangling

32:28.781 --> 32:31.281
and see if we can get
a child to maybe push it

32:31.283 --> 32:32.849
or move it or at least come out

32:32.851 --> 32:34.084
and interact with us.

32:34.086 --> 32:37.554
If we can capture that on film,

32:37.556 --> 32:39.122
I mean, dude,
that actually sounds

32:39.124 --> 32:41.091
<i>like a really good idea.</i>

32:41.093 --> 32:44.294
<i>[Dakota] I've set up a camera
filming those balloons.</i>

32:44.296 --> 32:46.096
<i>We're giving it some distance.</i>

32:46.098 --> 32:48.832
<i>And yeah, we're just gonna
ask some questions.</i>

32:48.834 --> 32:50.300
<i>[Tanner] Right.</i>

32:52.203 --> 32:53.937
Is there a child in here?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.607
We heard you coughing.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.643
We brought you balloons.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.014
[Tanner] You can take
one of those balloons

33:04.016 --> 33:06.350
to have if you want.

33:08.886 --> 33:11.755
So the balloons
are moving right now,

33:11.757 --> 33:13.623
but that's definitely
just the draft.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.892
There's a light wind in here.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.796
[Chelsea] So right now, we are

33:19.798 --> 33:21.832
in the high girls' cottage.

33:21.834 --> 33:26.536
This is the same location
that I started at.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.673
This is where I sat.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.342
When I was in here by myself,

33:32.344 --> 33:35.178
I had two words come
through on the Ovilus.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.781
And one was Harriet

33:37.783 --> 33:40.717
and the other was Ann.

33:40.719 --> 33:41.918
[Alex] Do you think
it'd be a good idea

33:41.920 --> 33:43.754
to try to follow up with that?

33:43.756 --> 33:48.225
[Chelsea] I would love
to get some answers.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.927
[Alex] What do you say
we whip out the Ovilus

33:50.929 --> 33:53.230
and ask some more questions?

33:53.232 --> 33:56.199
<i>Chelsea was here earlier</i>

33:56.201 --> 33:57.834
and you guys were talking to her

33:57.836 --> 34:00.504
through the same device.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.973
Is there any message
you wanna give us?

34:02.975 --> 34:05.075
We just wanna
have a conversation.

34:13.951 --> 34:17.587
Did you follow me over
to the Castle?

34:24.929 --> 34:27.831
I just keep thinking of...

34:27.833 --> 34:30.167
how sad it must have been
to be here

34:30.169 --> 34:33.637
and how lonely
every single person felt.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.706
It's really easy
to remember all the times

34:36.708 --> 34:38.909
that, like, I would fight
with my siblings

34:38.911 --> 34:40.710
and wish that I didn't have any

34:40.712 --> 34:42.612
or getting pissed at my parents

34:42.614 --> 34:43.880
for something stupid

34:43.882 --> 34:45.849
but, like, the children
that were here,

34:45.851 --> 34:48.218
that's all they wanted,
they would give anything

34:48.220 --> 34:50.821
- to have that.
- It's true. It's so true.

34:50.823 --> 34:52.122
I feel like
when we were younger,

34:52.124 --> 34:53.890
- we didn't really know.
- Yeah,

34:53.892 --> 34:58.095
it really makes me thankful
for what I had

34:58.097 --> 35:00.464
and what I still have.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.769
<i>[Chelsea] So we attempted,</i>

35:05.771 --> 35:08.572
<i>we did not get anything
on the Ovilus.</i>

35:08.574 --> 35:11.074
Honestly, I'm curious to hear
what the other guys

35:11.076 --> 35:12.876
have experienced tonight

35:12.878 --> 35:15.846
because we have not
seen them once.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.586
[Dakota] Nothing so far.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.057
It's just silent.

35:27.059 --> 35:29.559
- So weird.
- No noises,

35:29.561 --> 35:32.762
nothing playing
with the balloons.

35:32.764 --> 35:36.133
The sun's even starting
to come out.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.934
I feel like we just need
to give it time.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.236
It just needs
a little more time.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.971
Whoever's here,
whatever the child is,

35:40.973 --> 35:42.739
it just needs
to get comfortable.

35:44.175 --> 35:45.642
Whoever I heard earlier,

35:45.644 --> 35:48.845
can you please come
into this room

35:48.847 --> 35:50.847
and push one of those balloons
hard enough

35:50.849 --> 35:53.016
for us to know it's you?

35:56.320 --> 35:59.122
If you can play
with those balloons,

35:59.124 --> 36:00.991
we can bring in more toys.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.893
We can bring in
more stuff for you.

36:02.895 --> 36:05.061
But we just need to know
that you're here.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.969
Can you speak?
Can you cough again?

36:26.717 --> 36:28.785
I don't know if it's me
psyching myself out,

36:28.787 --> 36:30.487
but like out of nowhere,

36:30.489 --> 36:34.858
I feel like a really
weird presence.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.626
It almost feels like
we're about to get in trouble.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.295
[Dakota] Yeah.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.230
It's not like it's just
the feeling of this room

36:40.232 --> 36:42.032
because we've been in here
for a long time now,

36:42.034 --> 36:44.234
and it's felt pretty,
like, nothing.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.536
It feels like something knows
that we're intruding

36:46.538 --> 36:48.205
- in their space.
- [Dakota] Yeah.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.340
I don't know.

36:50.342 --> 36:53.076
I don't know
what to make of this.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.744
Nothing's going on
with the balloons.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.813
- [Tanner] No.
- I'm glad you feel it

36:56.815 --> 36:58.949
because I wasn't even
gonna say it,

36:58.951 --> 37:00.717
- but I was like...
- Yeah, like I was just like,

37:00.719 --> 37:02.752
okay, maybe I'm just
psyching myself out,

37:02.754 --> 37:05.755
but I was, like,
something feels weird now.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.923
- [balloon explodes]
- [Dakota] [bleep].

37:06.925 --> 37:08.091
[Tanner] Holy [bleep].

37:08.093 --> 37:09.626
[Dakota] It popped...
That balloon just popped.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.860
- [Tanner] Dude!
- Holy crap.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.529
[Tanner]
Dude, are you kidding me?

37:12.531 --> 37:14.431
[Dakota] The balloon,
the middle balloon is popped.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.999
Dude, what the [bleep] man.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.901
Do you see anything
on thermal over there?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.502
Anything at all?

37:19.504 --> 37:21.938
[Tanner] No, dude,
it's just a deflated just...

37:21.940 --> 37:23.340
[Dakota]
There's no heat signatures,

37:23.342 --> 37:25.208
- no cold spots?
- [Tanner] No, nothing.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.843
- Screw that, dude.
- Dude.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.078
Actually, screw that.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.179
I don't like that.

37:29.181 --> 37:31.548
We both at the same time
felt off

37:31.550 --> 37:34.084
and we both felt like
just something bad

37:34.086 --> 37:35.585
came into this room.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.755
I was, like,
something feels weird now.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.157
- [Dakota] What the [bleep].
- [Tanner] Holy [bleep].

37:42.793 --> 37:45.295
- Something feels weird now.
- [Dakota] What [bleep].

37:51.802 --> 37:52.902
<i>- [Dakota] Holy crap.
- [Tanner] Dude,</i>

37:52.904 --> 37:54.204
<i>- are you kidding me?
- [Dakota] The balloon,</i>

37:54.206 --> 37:56.406
the middle balloon is popped.

37:57.842 --> 37:59.576
Dude, that's [bleep] scary.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.745
- Let's go check it out.
- [Tanner] Okay.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.316
[Dakota] Okay.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.490
- What the...
- Dude, it like exploded,

38:13.492 --> 38:15.025
part of it is over here.

38:15.027 --> 38:17.060
[Tanner] What the hell.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.895
This is, like, 6 ft away.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.399
Why did this fly
all the way over here?

38:22.401 --> 38:25.902
It almost like as if
it walked in, it saw us,

38:25.904 --> 38:28.138
and got angry,
and just popped it.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.907
[Dakota] Yeah.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.942
Do you see anything
in the hallway?

38:34.945 --> 38:36.680
[Tanner] Nothing over here.

38:42.553 --> 38:44.321
- [Dakota] Nothing?
- [Tanner] Nothing.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.622
Come on, dude.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.890
[Tanner] Like,
I don't understand that.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.358
This is a total theory,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.493
but there is said to be a dark,

38:50.495 --> 38:52.095
malevolent force here

38:52.097 --> 38:54.731
that follows people in and out
of different buildings.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.533
I feel like
it might have just came

38:56.535 --> 38:59.602
into the school to freak us out.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.971
I'm gonna roll
on the digital recorder.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.374
<i>I'm gonna set it
underneath the balloon</i>

39:04.376 --> 39:05.709
that just popped.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.244
We're gonna go back
on the stage.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.648
Can you announce yourself?

39:11.650 --> 39:13.850
Can you tell us who you are?

39:14.985 --> 39:16.052
We have something,

39:16.054 --> 39:17.187
something that can hear you

39:17.189 --> 39:19.155
that will pick up your voice.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.657
Who are you?

39:31.068 --> 39:32.168
Nothing.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.772
- Nothing.
- All I know is I still

39:35.774 --> 39:37.841
feel like we're unwanted
in here.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.642
That definitely
was not the result

39:39.644 --> 39:41.978
I was looking for
with this experiment.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.180
I was hoping to get
a child ghost to come out

39:44.182 --> 39:45.849
and do something.

39:46.984 --> 39:49.819
That was quite the opposite.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.657
<i>Hey, Chelsea and Alex.</i>

39:54.659 --> 39:56.326
Yeah. What's up?

39:56.328 --> 39:58.361
Hey, I put up
a couple of balloons

39:58.363 --> 39:59.963
to try that experiment out

39:59.965 --> 40:01.331
where see if we can get a kid

40:01.333 --> 40:03.099
to move one of the balloons,

40:03.101 --> 40:06.202
<i>and one of the balloons
just kinda popped.</i>

40:06.204 --> 40:09.038
- What?
- What the hell.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.473
Yeah, dude.

40:10.475 --> 40:11.808
Me and Tanner
are gonna head there now,

40:11.810 --> 40:13.243
so we'll see you guys in a sec.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.879
<i>[Alex] All right.
Sounds good, man.</i>

40:15.881 --> 40:18.448
[Chelsea] Oh, we started off
the night blindfolded

40:18.450 --> 40:20.650
and we made it.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.285
[Alex] Oh, thank you.

40:22.287 --> 40:23.653
Holy [bleep] it's cold.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.555
[Chelsea]
You're... A balloon popped?

40:25.557 --> 40:27.624
[Dakota] Yeah.
A balloon freaking popped.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.360
Oh, my God, I would freak out.

40:30.362 --> 40:33.430
[dramatic music playing]

40:40.738 --> 40:43.673
That was such a difficult way

40:43.675 --> 40:45.408
to start a road trip.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.878
For me, this was more of,
like, a sympathetic experience

40:48.880 --> 40:51.748
that took
an emotional toll on me.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.950
I just hope that some
of the innocent souls

40:53.952 --> 40:55.618
of the children
who are still there,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.387
they were reassured
by our presence,

40:57.389 --> 40:59.456
and that they know
that they're still loved.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.291
The reason
why I blindfolded you guys

41:01.293 --> 41:03.426
is because I wanted you guys
to experience

41:03.428 --> 41:04.561
what the kids did.

41:04.563 --> 41:05.962
When they showed up there,

41:05.964 --> 41:07.897
they had no idea
what their future held.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.599
Knowing that I was by myself
in that building,

41:09.601 --> 41:11.201
you guys were all
far away from me,

41:11.203 --> 41:12.268
I just felt lonely.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.003
What an absolute

41:14.005 --> 41:17.173
helpless feeling
those kids must have felt

41:17.175 --> 41:19.742
- living there.
- This place is so sad.

41:24.949 --> 41:27.250
<i>I know we're tired.
I know I put you guys</i>

41:27.252 --> 41:29.686
<i>through an excruciating
experiment,</i>

41:29.688 --> 41:32.522
<i>kept you guys awake
for longer than we ever have.</i>

41:32.524 --> 41:34.390
<i>We have a long drive
ahead of us.</i>

41:34.392 --> 41:36.292
<i>We're gonna be able
to catch up on some rest.</i>

41:36.294 --> 41:39.262
Our next location is gonna be
another very challenging one.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.531
This has literally been
the longest day

41:41.533 --> 41:44.567
out of any of our road trip,
like I'm gassed.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.102
Honestly,
this was an emotional start,

41:46.104 --> 41:48.238
and I feel like
we're really starting off

41:48.240 --> 41:49.772
- on a high note.
- I got a lot

41:49.774 --> 41:52.108
of recovering to do
but I think you're right.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.777
I think it sets the tone
for the rest of the trip

41:54.779 --> 41:57.847
that we can do a lot more
than we think we can.

42:00.150 --> 42:03.152
[suspenseful music playing]
