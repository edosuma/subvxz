<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:01.909 --> 00:03.463
You took home someone else's baby

00:03.463 --> 00:05.400
and another family took home yours.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.048
Does anybody know where
this other child might be?

00:08.870 --> 00:11.195
I'm so glad you found it.

00:11.338 --> 00:12.175
Nice to meet you.

00:12.241 --> 00:13.143
Who's my father?

00:13.466 --> 00:15.496
It's a guy who took off
when Daphne was little

00:15.496 --> 00:16.804
and hasn't been in touch since.

00:16.941 --> 00:19.825
Did he leave because I'm deaf?

00:20.257 --> 00:21.477
Angelo Sorrento's my dad.

00:21.477 --> 00:23.059
I'm Angelo Sorrento's daughter.

00:23.633 --> 00:25.341
We found this guitar pick in his car.

00:25.669 --> 00:26.752
There are pictures of Bay

00:26.769 --> 00:28.000
when she was four years old.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.308
How do you have these?

00:29.499 --> 00:31.464
I found out 12 and a half years ago.

00:34.437 --> 00:36.605
Do you ever speak...

00:37.308 --> 00:39.575
like with your voice?

00:39.727 --> 00:43.345
There is one person who's
always been there for me.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.481
Emmett.

03:20.315 --> 03:24.004
I love the sense of the movement.
It reminds me of cave paintings.

03:24.453 --> 03:27.554
- Surréaliste.
- Yeah, that's exactly what I was going for...

03:27.703 --> 03:28.579
Surrealism.

03:29.424 --> 03:32.459
It's spray paint and stencil,
in case you're interested.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.595
Are you Bay, the artist?

03:35.419 --> 03:36.497
Yeah.

03:37.115 --> 03:39.700
Let me guess... you're a curator
from a gallery in New York.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.735
- Or Paris.
- No, I'm not.

03:42.018 --> 03:43.654
A scout looking for the next Basquiat?

03:44.109 --> 03:46.740
Because I'm also into neo-expressionism,
as I'm part puerto rican

03:46.775 --> 03:49.643
and extremely gifted.
But anti-heroin. Heroin's bad.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.480
- I'm not from any gallery, I'm sorry.
- Bummer.

03:53.739 --> 03:55.961
Hey, but you like art though.
So that's cool.

03:59.288 --> 04:00.288
Wow.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.307
Yeah?

04:02.522 --> 04:04.673
I'm wondering where you
got my lucky guitar pick.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.519
<i>Your</i> guitar pick?

04:20.038 --> 04:21.111
Angelo?

04:23.445 --> 04:25.612
Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

04:37.582 --> 04:40.569
How did you find me?
When did you find out?

04:40.657 --> 04:42.518
- What are you doing here?
- I know this is sudden,

04:42.553 --> 04:44.654
but I just found out and
I really wanted to see you.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.623
Look at you. ( Bay gasps )

04:48.592 --> 04:52.362
Um, h-how are Regina and Daphne?

04:52.396 --> 04:55.465
- They're good.
- Are they here? I'd love to see them.

04:55.499 --> 04:58.434
Uh, no, they're not. I don't
think that's such a great idea...

04:58.469 --> 05:01.604
You seeing them. I mean they don't
have the fondest memories of you.

05:02.299 --> 05:04.240
I'm sure you've heard a
lot of things about me,

05:04.937 --> 05:06.633
but I hope you can make up your own mind.

05:08.312 --> 05:10.413
Why did you just show up here?
I mean, why didn't you...

05:10.989 --> 05:12.348
call? This is so not fair.

05:12.718 --> 05:14.584
Hey, sweetie. Everything okay?

05:14.868 --> 05:15.870
Yeah.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.216
- This is a gallery owner from downtown.
- Oh.

05:21.216 --> 05:24.494
This is... this is my dad John Kennish.

05:24.718 --> 05:27.996
- Hi. Gallery owner... that's great.
- Angelo. Nice to meet you.

05:28.231 --> 05:31.267
Nice to meet you. Are you a parent here?

05:32.642 --> 05:33.654
Yes, I am.

05:34.185 --> 05:36.374
- John: A lot of interesting work, huh?
- Yeah.

05:36.527 --> 05:38.241
Bay is certainly talented.

05:38.275 --> 05:40.352
She's working on a piece
right now that's wild.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.121
- It's like tape and spray...
- Spray paint.

05:43.449 --> 05:44.418
- Spray paint.
- Spray paint, yeah.

05:44.516 --> 05:47.613
- I don't know where
she comes up with this stuff.
- Kathryn: <i>Honey.</i>

05:50.388 --> 05:52.655
Eh, my wife is trying to wrangle me

05:52.690 --> 05:54.579
into signing up for
the celebrity golf tournament.

05:54.579 --> 05:56.693
So I'd better go do that.
It was nice to meet you.

05:56.779 --> 05:58.328
- Very nice to meet you too.
- I'll see you.

05:58.689 --> 05:59.690
Bye.

06:00.297 --> 06:01.299
( sighs )

06:02.645 --> 06:04.500
That was surreal.

06:05.983 --> 06:08.216
Look, I'm staying at the bowman
hotel for the next three days.

06:08.281 --> 06:09.737
I'd love to see you.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.707
But if you don't want to, I understand.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.278
I'm just very happy I got
a chance to meet my daughter.

06:19.226 --> 06:20.227
Bye.

06:26.772 --> 06:29.267
Did the hospital send along
rose petals and wine?

06:29.267 --> 06:32.495
'Cause usually if someone's going
to screw me, I like a little wooing.

06:32.610 --> 06:35.598
- It's half as much as their last offer.
- Seriously?

06:35.632 --> 06:38.624
Just 'cause Regina knew about the girls
being switched we have no case anymore?

06:38.624 --> 06:41.304
We just lost significant leverage, yeah.

06:41.338 --> 06:43.373
And a no-fault clause?

06:43.407 --> 06:45.675
The hospital doesn't have to
admit they made a mistake.

06:46.176 --> 06:49.645
No! That's the least they can do.
They have to admit it.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.682
- You want us to accept this?
- Considering what's happened,

06:53.218 --> 06:55.351
this is as good as it's gonna get.

06:55.484 --> 06:58.488
- They're giving us 48 hours.
- 48 hours.

06:58.832 --> 07:01.657
After that, they could pull it and put
you through the expense of a trial,

07:01.692 --> 07:03.965
which they feel confident they'll win.

07:04.064 --> 07:07.597

me you were dating Emmett?

08:00.284 --> 08:03.352
Uh, I'm sorry.

08:03.715 --> 08:07.846
There wasn't exactly
a good time to tell you,

- That's why we're dating.

08:16.711 --> 08:20.336

You can't find someone else, really?

08:38.150 --> 08:40.832
You decided you liked him off a t-shirt.

08:40.942 --> 08:43.326
And the only reason that
you realized it is because your life's

08:43.360 --> 08:45.461
falling apart and you're looking
for someone to cling to.

08:46.611 --> 08:48.297
I should have never told you anything.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.572
And what happens when
things go back to normal?

08:51.016 --> 08:53.336
Is he just going to turn into
your little lapdog again?

08:54.020 --> 08:57.101
Is that really what you want for him?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.643
Is that what you came to tell me?

09:03.760 --> 09:06.215
Yeah, that was it.

09:15.492 --> 09:18.427
What's the best news I could
possibly give you right now?

09:18.462 --> 09:20.253
Olivia Wilde broke down
in front of my house,

09:20.253 --> 09:22.598
has to spend the night and wait for
the tow truck to come in the morning?

09:22.633 --> 09:23.864
Okay, second-best news.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.634
Now you're just
setting me up for disappointment.

09:25.867 --> 09:28.638
- We're playing East West Fest in St. Louis.
- What?

09:28.861 --> 09:32.313
Damn right. I sent in a DVD
of us playing the fundraiser,

09:32.516 --> 09:34.343
apparently it made them all
tingly because they want us

09:34.378 --> 09:36.546
to take the 15-minute
slot before cold war kids.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.248
Awesome! Yes!

09:39.283 --> 09:41.384
Only one hitch... we need Emmett.

09:41.561 --> 09:44.320
We needed a hook and two rich
kids from K.C. wasn't doing it,

09:44.354 --> 09:46.656
so I pushed the deaf drummer angle,
they loved it.

09:47.214 --> 09:48.817
We haven't played together
since the fundraiser though.

09:48.817 --> 09:50.278
I don't know if he'll be up for it.

09:50.738 --> 09:52.495
Well, we need to convince him.

09:52.529 --> 09:54.263
No Emmett, no show.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.403
Bay: He just waltzes in without warning,

10:00.437 --> 10:02.505
tells me he's here for 72 hours

10:02.539 --> 10:05.474
and then just expects me to drop everything

10:05.509 --> 10:09.545
and get to know him, risk pissing
off Daphne and my parents...

10:09.874 --> 10:12.448
Ha ha, all three of them.

10:15.636 --> 10:19.346
I want to be mad, but I'm not.

10:20.046 --> 10:23.426
He's never done anything to me.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.495
How do I know what's true

10:26.530 --> 10:30.366
unless I hear what he has to say?

10:35.051 --> 10:38.674
How do you sign and eat at the same time?

10:42.746 --> 10:44.580
Uh-huh.

10:47.248 --> 10:50.674
I'm sorry Daphne got mad at you.

10:57.672 --> 11:01.946
Okay, but, you know, things have
been sort of sucky for her lately.

11:02.083 --> 11:06.469
And it can't be easy for
her that we're together.

11:06.503 --> 11:07.670
And I just...

11:07.704 --> 11:10.640
I feel kind of bad.

11:16.819 --> 11:18.648

11:20.152 --> 11:22.204

11:22.877 --> 11:23.884
I don't know.

11:25.378 --> 11:28.758
Maybe I'm better off
just letting this one go.

11:34.970 --> 11:37.299
Emmett, you think I go looking for trouble?

11:56.787 --> 12:00.356
You've got 15 minutes.

12:04.902 --> 12:07.227
There is a cute store **,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.195
that's empty, within my budget,

12:09.229 --> 12:12.711
and I found a distributer who will
sell me sinks and dryers at wholesale.

12:12.831 --> 12:15.468
- Mmm, what about clients?
- Well, mine are pretty loyal.

12:15.573 --> 12:18.070
- I think they'll follow me.
- Okay.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.072
Can I get an appointment whenever I want?

12:20.107 --> 12:23.075
- Of course.
- Then I fully support it.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.045
- Support what?
- Tell her.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.414
I'm thinking of opening up my own salon.

12:28.618 --> 12:32.558
Plus she doesn't do so well with authority,
so might as well be her own boss.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.850
- Right?
- Mom!

12:34.041 --> 12:37.089
Congratulations. That's great.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.458
Well, don't congratulate me just yet.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.261
At least you know what you want to do.

12:43.081 --> 12:45.364
That's half the battle.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.504
Excuse me.

12:50.091 --> 12:53.405
So the cars... the cars are
going to roll down the ramp.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.441
Rolling, right? Rolling, yes yes.

12:55.705 --> 12:58.344
Then you kids meet them at
the end for the wipe down.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.980
Yes, very important, the wipe down.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.497
Spray bottle... sst sst. Inside, outside,

13:03.629 --> 13:05.151
details are very important.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.121
What... what is that?

13:09.987 --> 13:11.123
Like a glass thing?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.292
Um, Daphne, Daphne!

13:13.593 --> 13:16.195
Emmett's trying to tell me some...
I don't... um...

13:16.324 --> 13:20.065
He wants to know if they'll have
a sign that says it's for Carlton.

13:20.226 --> 13:24.170
A sign? I got a banner coming tomorrow.

13:24.379 --> 13:26.238
Yeah, tomorrow, you like that? I got that.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.208
Listen, can you fill her in on
the rolling and the wipe down?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.210
Excellent, all right, see you later.

13:42.842 --> 13:45.090
I was in Chicago on the train after work,

13:45.125 --> 13:48.127
looking for something to read.
Someone had left a paper.

13:49.124 --> 13:51.197
There it was... switched at birth.

13:51.712 --> 13:55.000
I nearly died. My girls... you...

13:55.302 --> 13:56.905
- I mean her.
- It gets confusing.

13:56.998 --> 13:58.601
Okay, so what am I exactly?

13:58.678 --> 14:01.340
- Italian?
- Italian, french, some algerian.

14:01.518 --> 14:03.175
- Algerian?
- Yeah.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.879

14:23.997 --> 14:26.232
I'm just excited. I don't
want to waste any more time.

14:26.635 --> 14:30.002
You know, I tried calling your mother,
but her number was disconnected.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.273
Uh, she and Daphne and Adrianna,

14:34.815 --> 14:36.242
they live in our guesthouse now.

14:36.391 --> 14:39.311
Adrianna too?
Wow, they didn't even talk back then.

14:39.904 --> 14:42.006
She's sober... Regina.

14:42.427 --> 14:43.434
No kidding.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.419
So what happened there

14:47.790 --> 14:49.421
with you and Regina?

14:50.066 --> 14:52.258
It takes too much to tell you in 15 minutes.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.394
I need time with you... real time.

14:56.802 --> 14:58.203
I want that too.

14:59.029 --> 15:00.611
But I can't do this in secret.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.135
I can't hide it from my parents.

15:03.571 --> 15:06.272
However you want to do it, we'll do it.

16:52.674 --> 16:55.261
Our Bay's artwork was definitely
the best of that show.

16:55.261 --> 16:58.330
- Of course it was.
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>

16:58.364 --> 17:00.299
Hi guys. Uh...

17:01.314 --> 17:03.273
I invited someone for dinner.

17:05.265 --> 17:07.579
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:08.132 --> 17:09.138
<i>Hi again.</i>

17:09.883 --> 17:12.855
Uh, mom, this is Angelo Sorrento.

17:13.146 --> 17:16.315
So nice to finally meet you.
You've done an incredible job,

17:16.492 --> 17:18.550
- both of you.
- Well, thank you.

17:20.137 --> 17:23.387
I'm sorry, who are you again?

17:28.992 --> 17:30.146
Mom...

17:31.159 --> 17:32.166
dad,

17:33.369 --> 17:35.067
this is my father.

17:39.263 --> 17:41.408
- What are you doing here?
- I came to meet Bay.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.375
No, I mean here, at our house.

17:43.409 --> 17:45.731
- Well, Angelo was at my art show...
- Sweetie, I understand.

17:45.813 --> 17:47.379
And by the way, what the hell was that?

17:47.482 --> 17:50.344
- Wait, you've met him before?
- Yeah, he said he was some art guy.

17:50.891 --> 17:52.384
What were you doing at Bay's school?

17:52.560 --> 17:55.012
Angelo: <i>I read in an article that
she was at Buckner Hall.</i>

17:55.188 --> 17:57.522
The website said there was a
student art show. I just showed up.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.248
- Why didn't you call us first?
- So you just ambushed her?

18:00.319 --> 18:02.461
- It wasn't like that.
- And then lied to me right to my face?

18:02.495 --> 18:04.790
- Wait, it's not his fault.
I could have introduced you...
- Now hold on.

18:04.790 --> 18:06.498
- But I wasn't ready.
- I'm not trying to cause trouble.

18:06.532 --> 18:10.208
Okay, there are boundaries. You can't
just show up at a teenager's school

18:10.208 --> 18:12.347
and surprise her with information
like this. I mean really!

18:12.347 --> 18:14.032
Bay, you need to go to your room right now.

18:14.032 --> 18:16.074
- I'm not going to my room.
- Right now! And you need to leave this house.

18:16.109 --> 18:17.376
We will go through proper channels

18:17.410 --> 18:19.378
and arrange a meeting at
the appropriate time and place.

18:19.587 --> 18:22.180
With all due respect, I don't
need permission to see my own kid.

18:22.215 --> 18:24.349
Actually you do need my permission
and you need to leave right now.

18:24.384 --> 18:27.505
- Dad!
- Honey, I can't believe
that you kept this from us.

18:27.576 --> 18:29.064
And where were you two before this?

18:29.152 --> 18:31.356
We were hanging out for a little bit.
And then I wanted...

18:31.439 --> 18:33.223
You were just hanging out?
Why didn't you tell us?

18:33.223 --> 18:36.353
If I knew you were going to freak out this
much, I wouldn't have even brought him here.

18:36.353 --> 18:38.881
- You don't have to worry.
I'm not going to kidnap her or something.
- What?!

18:38.881 --> 18:42.067
- John.
- Listen. What would you do if you
just found out you had a daughter?

18:42.101 --> 18:44.550
- I did just find out.
- Okay, great, so you understand.

18:44.632 --> 18:46.505
No, don't do that.
Don't compare yourself to me.

18:46.539 --> 18:49.374
You walked out on your family...
on my daughter.

18:49.721 --> 18:52.511
You are not welcome in this house.
You are not welcome in Bay's life.

18:52.545 --> 18:56.114
- You have nothing to do with her.
- Dad, he's the reason I exist.

18:58.217 --> 19:00.392
- Hi.
- Honey, I think we should...

19:00.452 --> 19:02.354
- Is this Daphne?
- Daphne: <i>What's going on?</i>

19:02.388 --> 19:04.289
- Who is this?
- He's...

19:04.324 --> 19:06.986
- Sweetie, it's okay, just go with your mom.
- Daphne...

19:07.062 --> 19:09.120
- It's not... he's nothing.
- You leave right now.

19:09.224 --> 19:11.196
Will someone please answer me, who is this?

19:11.230 --> 19:12.633
- No, stop stop!
- I need to talk to her.

19:12.737 --> 19:15.233
You want me to call the police? Go!

19:20.273 --> 19:22.143
Great, okay, she's gone. Thank you very...

19:22.187 --> 19:24.201
Can you please leave now? Go.

19:26.784 --> 19:28.305
I want to hear it.

19:29.415 --> 19:32.184
I want to hear what you have to say.

19:32.218 --> 19:34.119
Okay, great. Do you want to go outside?

19:34.153 --> 19:36.321
No, here now.

19:36.356 --> 19:40.058
Look, I don't know what Regina told you,

19:40.387 --> 19:43.095
but there were a lot of reasons why I left.

19:43.129 --> 19:45.947
It wasn't simple. But it doesn't matter,

19:45.947 --> 19:49.134
because what matters to you
is that your father left you.

19:49.575 --> 19:52.700
And I'm sorry for that.
But I'm here now to get to know you,

19:52.782 --> 19:55.206
see if I can make it up to you.

19:59.452 --> 20:02.114
You don't understand a
word I'm saying, do you?

20:05.203 --> 20:07.906
No, I don't.

20:18.823 --> 20:21.366
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, man. How's it going?

20:25.942 --> 20:28.120
Yes. Or-or no.

20:28.170 --> 20:31.276
Um, we're here to see you, man.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.549
Uh... how good is he at reading lips?

20:37.904 --> 20:40.218
Good enough to know that you're
talking about him right now.

20:40.476 --> 20:43.935
Listen, we're going to a music festival

20:44.028 --> 20:45.368
in St. Louis

20:45.571 --> 20:51.062
and we got in using a tape
that was made that night

20:51.097 --> 20:52.531
at the fundraiser where you played.

20:52.914 --> 20:55.500
And we're going.
We want you to come with us.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.304
Groupies, free beer,
road trip... what do you say?

21:10.042 --> 21:12.184
Maybe he didn't understand us.

21:12.218 --> 21:14.219
Yeah, maybe.

21:15.481 --> 21:17.322
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

21:17.747 --> 21:21.126
It's not your fault. I'm sure
it was just a matter of time.

21:23.022 --> 21:26.666
He just showed up. I mean, who is this guy?

21:26.962 --> 21:28.400
And where did you meet him?

21:28.434 --> 21:31.230
We met in Chicago. He just moved there.

21:31.306 --> 21:35.106
He's not violent.
He's impulsive and unpredictable.

21:35.141 --> 21:38.310
But the only person he poses
any real threat to is me.

21:39.263 --> 21:42.481
Yeah well, you should have seen
Daphne's face when she saw him.

21:42.515 --> 21:44.316
He spoke to Daphne?

21:46.459 --> 21:49.321
- I'll go talk to her.
- You know, I don't care
what this guy's rights are,

21:49.355 --> 21:51.750
- I want him gone.
- Honey, we can't just ban him.

21:51.838 --> 21:54.159
- Why not?
- On the upside,

21:54.193 --> 21:56.127
leaving is his specialty.

21:58.431 --> 22:01.299
<i>( tv playing softly )</i>

22:05.633 --> 22:06.505
Are you okay?

22:12.024 --> 22:13.480
Did you know that he was here?

22:13.885 --> 22:17.182
Of course not. I would
have told you if I did.

22:18.032 --> 22:21.052
I just don't know what else
you would keep from me.

22:23.165 --> 22:24.654
I guess I deserve that.

22:27.093 --> 22:29.060
I don't want him here.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.472
- Okay.
- I don't want to see him again.

22:31.581 --> 22:33.852
Bay can see him somewhere else.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.068
I can't control what Bay is gonna do,

22:38.337 --> 22:41.339
but I won't let him hurt you again.

22:41.869 --> 22:43.141
I promise.

22:53.119 --> 22:54.452
<i>( knocks )</i>

22:54.487 --> 22:58.156
- Can I come in?
- I can't believe you did that.

22:58.190 --> 23:01.393
Wait a minute, we are not
saying that you can't see him.

23:01.427 --> 23:05.030
But there are right and wrong
ways to initiate contact

23:05.064 --> 23:07.999
and that was totally
disrespectful to me and dad.

23:08.091 --> 23:10.302
Mom, this isn't about you. It's about me.

23:10.336 --> 23:13.371
Honey, it's not that simple.
We have to protect you.

23:13.995 --> 23:18.109
Mom, my entire life was thrown off
course when I was five hours old.

23:18.422 --> 23:20.111
Everything about me is messed up.

23:20.146 --> 23:23.415
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is. You know it is.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.252
There's this whole other me that
I think about every single day...

23:27.286 --> 23:30.188
Who was I supposed to be?
And whether you like it or not,

23:30.222 --> 23:32.257
Angelo Sorrento is key to that answer.

23:33.492 --> 23:36.394
And no matter what you or dad do,
nothing is going to stop me

23:36.429 --> 23:38.430
from wanting to find out more about him.

23:41.739 --> 23:42.839
Okay.

23:45.285 --> 23:46.817
Okay.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.390
Can you talk to dad

23:51.375 --> 23:53.178
And get him to back off?

24:48.701 --> 24:50.266
So why doesn't he want to go with us?

24:50.496 --> 24:52.537
He doesn't usually hang
out with hearing people.

24:52.571 --> 24:54.961
And I think the fundraiser was
like a one-time thing for him.

24:55.377 --> 24:56.509
That sucks!

24:56.980 --> 24:58.819
Well wait, what does that make you then?

25:00.482 --> 25:01.555

Hey hey.

25:04.214 --> 25:05.450
Oh, you're here.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.418
Didn't figure you were the charitable type.

25:07.453 --> 25:10.388
I've been blessed with so much
I figured I should give back.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.424
( laughs ) I lied to him and told
him it was a bikini car wash.

25:13.459 --> 25:15.793
- So he showed up.
- That hurts, man.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.557
Gina.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.408
You look incredible.

25:30.978 --> 25:32.577
I just found out about the girls.

25:32.795 --> 25:33.966
By accident.

25:34.119 --> 25:35.854
Why didn't you call me?

25:37.326 --> 25:38.984
Funny how now that you have a rich daughter,

25:38.984 --> 25:41.298
you suddenly seem interested
in being a father.

25:41.523 --> 25:43.655
Gina, you really think that's me?

25:44.954 --> 25:47.458
Just hear me out. You owe me that much.

25:57.370 --> 25:59.203
I can see that look in your eyes.

25:59.329 --> 26:01.406
You were hoping I'd be shirtless, wet,

26:01.512 --> 26:03.083
dripping with suds.

26:04.823 --> 26:07.307
Whatever that was,
I'm glad I didn't understand it.

26:07.701 --> 26:09.647
Well, of course you couldn't.
You weren't looking at my lips.

26:09.682 --> 26:12.150
You were too busy checking
me out like a piece of meat.

26:13.688 --> 26:14.686
( snickers ) No, I wasn't.

26:15.307 --> 26:19.657
To you I am just a big
beefy drumstick with eyes.

26:22.628 --> 26:24.595
And I'm a vegetarian.

26:24.630 --> 26:26.631
At least I got you to smile.

26:27.510 --> 26:30.702
Hey, come on. There's a pickup
truck with our names on it.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.471
♪ take me ♪

26:35.778 --> 26:39.412
I was holding a D.N.A. test in my hands
that said Daphne could not be related to me.

26:39.461 --> 26:41.655
And you looked me in the eyes and
said you hadn't had an affair.

26:41.737 --> 26:43.954
- Because I hadn't.
- What was I supposed to think?

26:44.025 --> 26:46.104
That our daughter was switched at birth.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.818
Who thinks that? She was blonde,
she had blue eyes.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.522
- Look at me, look at you.
- You should have trusted me.

26:51.620 --> 26:54.592
I told you I didn't care if you slept with
someone else, I just wanted to know the
truth.

26:54.626 --> 26:57.858
- I was telling you the truth.
- Look at it from my point of view.

26:57.951 --> 27:01.103
- You walked out on us.
- You pushed me out.

27:01.185 --> 27:04.075
- What?! No, I didn't.
- You said, "if you don't trust me,"

27:04.075 --> 27:07.073
"then just go."
You didn't give me any choice.

27:07.850 --> 27:11.194
- You left when she went deaf.
- No, don't put that on me.

27:11.445 --> 27:12.983
I wanted to stay in touch and you know that.

27:13.043 --> 27:15.313
By the time you tried,
she'd already forgotten about you.

27:15.347 --> 27:17.377
- It was just easier.
- Okay, but I wanted to.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.969
You know what? I have to go.
I have to go back to work.

27:18.969 --> 27:21.385
Listen, I know you want to blame someone,

27:21.420 --> 27:24.606
but it's not me. It's the hospital.

27:24.748 --> 27:26.724
If this hadn't happened

27:27.101 --> 27:29.175
We would still be together.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.764
- I have to go.
- Gina.

27:35.501 --> 27:37.602
( laughing ) I can't believe he did that.

27:39.977 --> 27:42.899
You said 20 bucks to run through the
car wash. Now quit laughing and pay up.

27:43.069 --> 27:46.828
- You bailed out halfway through the hot wax, man.
- It was like 1,000Â° in there.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.267
I think I lost an eyebrow.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.413
How's that "I'll never gamble again"
thing going for both of you?

27:51.490 --> 27:52.541
- Awesome.
- Clearly.

27:52.541 --> 27:53.718
All right, 20 bucks.

27:54.511 --> 27:57.588
Um, Toby... um uh,
what's the sign for "bet"?

27:58.215 --> 28:00.291
- Okay, he bet...
- You should have seen him, man.

28:00.431 --> 28:02.752
- <i>Oh my god.
- He bet Wilke 20 bucks</i>

28:02.779 --> 28:04.547
that he wouldn't go through the car wash.

28:04.547 --> 28:07.365
Uh, here, Toby bet me I wouldn't do it...

28:07.399 --> 28:09.567
( silent )

28:18.577 --> 28:20.745
Hey, what's wrong?

28:24.449 --> 28:26.484
I'm sorry, okay? I forgot.

28:27.398 --> 28:29.417
I finger spelled it. What's the big deal?

28:29.784 --> 28:31.885
Hey, okay, I'm studying my ass off.

28:32.383 --> 28:34.425
I'm practicing all the time.
It's a new language.

28:34.577 --> 28:36.460
It's hard to pick up in two weeks.

28:37.187 --> 28:39.330
Okay, what... why are you
picking a fight with me?

28:42.401 --> 28:43.534
Okay, slow down.

28:55.327 --> 28:56.909
Why are you doing this?

29:28.105 --> 29:31.682
Daphne told you that she likes you.

29:33.473 --> 29:34.585
Didn't she?

29:46.907 --> 29:50.468
My credit card says "Adam"
but my I.D. says "Angelo."

29:50.995 --> 29:53.392
I explained to the manager. Is she here?

29:53.687 --> 29:56.641
Hello, Angelo. Let's talk.

29:56.992 --> 29:58.005
Excuse me.

30:00.128 --> 30:02.380
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.

30:02.414 --> 30:04.749
- Bay really wanted to talk to me.
- Would you do me a favor?

30:08.763 --> 30:10.382
Stop hiding behind Bay.

30:10.804 --> 30:13.591
I came here to talk to you, man to man.

30:14.273 --> 30:17.328
Bay's my daughter too.
I deserve to get to know her.

30:18.541 --> 30:20.331
I don't need permission for that.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.434
Second, I'm not your enemy here.

30:23.794 --> 30:26.437
Who is the enemy, Angelo?

30:26.706 --> 30:29.440
Regina? Alcoholism?

30:29.474 --> 30:31.542
- Society?
- The hospital.

30:33.745 --> 30:35.767
That's why you showed up.

30:36.413 --> 30:38.649
- For the money.
- I want justice.

30:39.001 --> 30:40.785
- Just like you.
- Mm-hmm.

30:41.032 --> 30:44.534
- I know about your lawsuit.
- Did you know my lawsuit is tanking?

30:44.616 --> 30:46.723
No, but I know something you don't.

30:46.810 --> 30:49.940
- And what's that?
- The nurse assigned to our babies that night

30:50.624 --> 30:52.530
had worked 48 hours straight.

30:54.476 --> 30:57.601
That's 36 hours past union rules.

30:58.427 --> 31:00.020
I have a sworn affidavit.

31:00.758 --> 31:01.919
I'll give you a copy.

31:02.767 --> 31:04.359
You don't have to like me,

31:05.213 --> 31:06.750
but you do need me.

31:12.923 --> 31:15.145
So, this is her. This is the nurse.

31:15.323 --> 31:17.787
- Brizia Munoz.
- <i>Can you please explain to me</i>

31:17.864 --> 31:21.125
how you missed this? What I am paying
this firm thousands of dollars for?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.959
We didn't miss it. We deposed her.

31:23.024 --> 31:25.328
She couldn't remember the night
or how long her shift was.

31:25.421 --> 31:27.938
- Doesn't the hospital keep records?
- The shift records

31:27.938 --> 31:30.948
are destroyed after 10 years.
It's hospital policy.

31:31.046 --> 31:34.970
- Of course it is.
- How come she didn't say anything before?

31:35.424 --> 31:37.131
She may not have wanted to speak up.

31:37.191 --> 31:39.014
The hospital may have been
putting pressure on her.

31:39.112 --> 31:41.547
Let me ask you something.
If Angelo joins our lawsuit,

31:41.629 --> 31:44.223
we can use this testimony
to make our case, right?

31:44.874 --> 31:46.220
( sighs ) We could, but...

31:48.015 --> 31:50.286
You know, there's also
the distinct possibility

31:50.385 --> 31:53.679
that Angelo or his lawyer promised her
a part of his settlement money

31:53.745 --> 31:55.496
to get her to say what's in this document.

31:55.530 --> 31:57.498
- They paid her off?
- It's a little far-fetched, don't you think?

31:57.532 --> 31:59.266
How well do you know him?

32:00.721 --> 32:03.605
It's a little convenient that
she's just now remembered.

32:03.737 --> 32:07.693
And if he did bribe this nurse and
you're joined in the same lawsuit,

32:07.835 --> 32:10.030
it could have serious ramifications.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.343
Like what?

32:11.917 --> 32:14.380
Suborning perjury, witness tampering...

32:14.801 --> 32:19.319
criminal offenses.
We're talking potential jail time.

32:23.743 --> 32:27.227
Eventually I'll hire another
stylist and a manicurist.

32:27.262 --> 32:30.490
Depending on demand, I'd also
like to add someone to do facials.

32:30.522 --> 32:32.099
That's ambitious.

32:32.295 --> 32:33.921
There is no other full-service salon

32:33.981 --> 32:35.907
within five miles of my location.

32:35.973 --> 32:39.406
- The demand is built in.
- Hmm, well, this is impressive.

32:39.441 --> 32:43.177
- You've obviously done your homework.
- Been doing it since I was 21.

32:43.639 --> 32:47.962
Do you have any other sources
of collateral besides your car?

32:48.011 --> 32:50.284
Property or savings, perhaps?

32:50.550 --> 32:51.606
Uh... no.

32:52.017 --> 32:54.454
Or someone who could co-sign
the loan with you?

32:55.459 --> 32:58.578
My collateral is my track
record and my client loyalty.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.241
I am a good risk.

33:00.597 --> 33:06.009
I believe you, but unfortunately
this is a numbers-driven decision.

33:06.091 --> 33:10.204
With your credit history and the
personal debt you're already carrying,

33:10.238 --> 33:13.073
our formula reaches a different conclusion.

33:13.107 --> 33:15.209
Can't you override your formula?

33:15.382 --> 33:18.627
I wish we could. But if things change

33:18.693 --> 33:22.282
and you find additional
collateral or a co-signer,

33:22.425 --> 33:24.384
we'd love to do business with you.

33:33.703 --> 33:34.792
Hey.

33:37.922 --> 33:39.171
Wait wait...

33:39.733 --> 33:42.502
I don't know what you're saying.

33:45.791 --> 33:49.309
I'm here because of Bay.

33:56.423 --> 33:58.118
She likes you.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.488
But now she's sad.

34:04.352 --> 34:09.161
Don't treat my sister like that.

34:15.436 --> 34:17.172
Gun? Oh, gun.

34:18.498 --> 34:19.570
"Sister."

34:20.172 --> 34:21.130
Thanks.

34:25.402 --> 34:28.324
Angelo's obviously going to want to
have some kind of contact with Bay.

34:28.447 --> 34:30.114
Bay wants contact with him too.

34:30.733 --> 34:32.435
Well fine, they can have a phone call a week

34:32.505 --> 34:34.699
as long as one of us is
home to monitor the call.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.391
I don't think that we
can control that, honey.

34:37.699 --> 34:40.456
What are we supposed to do? Let him
see her whenever the hell he wants to?

34:40.527 --> 34:45.098
I've been dealing with it too...
another mom 50 feet away.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.303
It's not fun, I know that,

34:47.467 --> 34:49.393
but this is our situation and

34:49.967 --> 34:53.172
for the girls' sake,
we gotta find a way to make this work.

34:54.745 --> 34:57.344
You are an incredible woman.
Did you know that?

34:58.974 --> 35:00.966
Yeah, thanks.

35:01.568 --> 35:03.259
What? What did I say?

35:03.566 --> 35:05.793
It's just these past few months

35:05.842 --> 35:11.158
I've been trying to be a good
mom to both Bay and Daphne,

35:11.192 --> 35:13.393
and deal with your anger and the lawsuit

35:13.428 --> 35:18.031
and Toby and trying to figure out
how to make it work with Regina

35:18.066 --> 35:20.167
and...

35:20.376 --> 35:23.203
I got lost in the shuffle.

35:23.758 --> 35:28.175
I'm just "that mom whose
daughters got switched."

35:28.682 --> 35:29.689
Okay,

35:30.384 --> 35:32.661
what does that mean?
What do you want to do?

35:34.598 --> 35:35.709
( exhales )

35:36.365 --> 35:37.438
I don't know.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.655
But I'm going to find out.

35:46.746 --> 35:48.195
What are you doing here?

35:48.885 --> 35:50.397
No, okay, it's fine.

35:50.431 --> 35:54.201
You and Daphne, I get it.
I can't compete with that.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.104
Just don't make this harder
for me than it is already.

35:57.947 --> 36:01.108
Just because I always
have some snappy comeback

36:01.142 --> 36:03.143
doesn't mean that I don't break easily.

36:50.096 --> 36:51.097
I...

36:51.814 --> 36:52.821
just...

36:53.210 --> 36:54.211
want...

36:54.736 --> 36:55.743
you.

37:12.761 --> 37:13.763
All right.

37:14.786 --> 37:16.313
Bay, thanks for letting us use your car.

37:16.619 --> 37:20.320
Yeah sure. I thought you were playing,
like, four songs.

37:20.548 --> 37:22.155
Hey, go big or go home.

37:22.699 --> 37:26.093
You sure you don't want to
be our roadie? Last chance.

37:27.968 --> 37:30.130
Roadie... you know,

37:30.874 --> 37:33.166
beer-fueled guys who are muscular

37:33.347 --> 37:35.102
<i>and you know, move stuff,</i>

37:35.136 --> 37:36.269
and check out groupies.

37:36.324 --> 37:39.106
Oh, tempting, but no.

37:39.140 --> 37:42.726
There he is. We are going to rock!

37:42.765 --> 37:44.253
Yeah!

37:49.052 --> 37:53.386
Hey, so I have something for you.

38:00.801 --> 38:04.331
It's for the front of your drum kit.

38:18.393 --> 38:22.082
- Hey, Bay, could I check that out?
- Yeah, sure.

38:23.652 --> 38:27.254
Oh, and here. So you guys can sticker-bomb.

38:27.288 --> 38:28.355
- Yes!
- Awesome.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.874
- That's awesome.
- Bay, this is sweet.

38:29.874 --> 38:30.602
I know.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.392
Well, all right, gentlemen, the road's a-callin'.

38:33.427 --> 38:34.602
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

38:34.662 --> 38:35.778
Here, I got this.

38:44.305 --> 38:46.139
Yeah!

38:56.840 --> 39:00.153
Hey, just a heads up.
I think I'm kinda into Daphne.

39:01.103 --> 39:02.110
Really?

39:03.713 --> 39:04.934
Is she okay with that?

39:05.038 --> 39:06.991
No, but she will be.

39:09.224 --> 39:10.832
- Okay.
- You ready?

39:10.991 --> 39:11.998
( grunts )

39:12.600 --> 39:13.607
Bye!

39:14.068 --> 39:15.714
- Whoo!
- See you later.

39:16.677 --> 39:18.581
Yeah, rock on!

39:18.805 --> 39:21.208
Bay: Bye.
♪ this changes everything... ♪

39:21.602 --> 39:23.002
Road trip!

39:23.161 --> 39:27.346
And the world will never be the same.

39:29.684 --> 39:31.090
Hey, uh...

39:32.153 --> 39:35.648
I'm just checking... is everything okay?

39:37.443 --> 39:38.450
Fine.

39:39.293 --> 39:42.229
Cool, 'cause... I mean, I know

39:42.263 --> 39:44.551
that it's been, like, one harsh thing

39:44.612 --> 39:46.346
after another lately.

39:47.304 --> 39:50.527
In a way it's been helpful.
I know what I want.

39:50.937 --> 39:54.729
Okay. Hey, that's good.

39:56.776 --> 39:58.916
What is that exactly?

40:00.130 --> 40:02.035
I'm not giving up this time.

40:02.297 --> 40:05.022
You didn't want me to be with Liam,
so I broke up with him.

40:05.531 --> 40:07.540
But I'm not giving up on Emmett.

40:09.088 --> 40:11.649
I was checking in about Angelo.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.395
- I'm not okay with that either.
- Oh, okay.

40:17.368 --> 40:20.656
But he's my dad so...

40:26.396 --> 40:27.584
( knocks )

40:28.208 --> 40:29.308
Come in.

40:29.526 --> 40:32.212
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:32.438 --> 40:35.115
How did it go with Angelo?
Did John go see him?

40:35.212 --> 40:37.926
Yeah, it went fine. You know what?

40:38.030 --> 40:40.345
The thing is is he's going
back to Chicago tonight.

40:40.443 --> 40:43.579
Maybe he and Bay will have
conversations over the phone,

40:43.579 --> 40:44.919
but for now,

40:45.691 --> 40:47.688
Let's just manage him from afar.

40:48.095 --> 40:50.649
Huh. It sounds about right.

40:51.606 --> 40:54.267
Okay, see you later.

41:00.441 --> 41:02.442
Hey. ( Regina gasps )

41:03.519 --> 41:05.888
You keep appearing.

41:06.102 --> 41:07.962
I called you. Where were you?

41:08.132 --> 41:11.443
I, um... I went to
the bank to try to get a loan

41:11.541 --> 41:13.320
- to start my own salon.
- Great.

41:13.380 --> 41:15.470
It's not gonna happen.

41:16.302 --> 41:18.135
It seems impossible to start over.

41:18.606 --> 41:20.039
What about that lawsuit?

41:20.674 --> 41:23.163
No, um, let's just say there's reasons

41:23.322 --> 41:25.298
I'm not going to get
anything from that hospital.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.826
But I am. And what's mine is yours.

41:28.488 --> 41:30.715
- <i>Angelo...
- No no, I mean it.</i>

41:31.695 --> 41:34.307
I want us to be a family
the way we were supposed to be.

41:36.587 --> 41:38.912
I'm here to tell you I'm
not going back to Chicago.

41:39.651 --> 41:42.847
I'm staying. Things are gonna be different,

41:43.635 --> 41:44.899
I promise you.
