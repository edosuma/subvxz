WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:04.755
Previously on Future Man...

00:04.881 --> 00:05.756
That's the Kronitorium,

00:05.840 --> 00:07.067
where the super cure
was engineered.

00:07.091 --> 00:09.218
Your boss sounds like
a real interesting fellow.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.387
Kronish, nobody's
seen him in years,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.681
but he's giving some
sort of big announcement.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.183
My name is Joosh.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.643
You got a court order declaring
us mentally incompetent

00:17.685 --> 00:19.061
and putting us in this place.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.789
We need to kill Kronish,
destroy his research,

00:20.813 --> 00:22.023
and blow up the Kronitorium

00:22.064 --> 00:24.817
but this mission calls
for a much bigger kill team.

00:24.901 --> 00:27.445
If there's two of me,
that means there's two of you.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.280
Guys, you can have
the entire team back.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.032
Resistance forever!

00:31.115 --> 00:32.283
Mongoose, Butterfly,

00:32.408 --> 00:35.161
Owl before he got
that brain worm thing.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.538
All I have to do
is beat the game again.

00:37.622 --> 00:38.932
We need to back up,
there are about to be

00:38.956 --> 00:42.752
45 bloodthirsty warriors
up in this piece.

00:48.007 --> 00:50.509
Bomb, bomb, bomb, get it off me!

00:50.635 --> 00:53.137
‐Get it off me!
‐Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!

00:53.262 --> 00:54.889
‐Don't move!
‐...just chop my arm off!

00:55.014 --> 00:57.266
Stop moving,
if you breathe wrong,

00:57.391 --> 00:58.643
this blows.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.189
Fuck me.

01:03.314 --> 01:04.315
Clear.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.943
Fuckin' skull cunts
tagged me just as I jumped.

01:07.026 --> 01:07.944
Dingo, what happened?

01:08.027 --> 01:09.171
Where's the rest of the team?

01:09.195 --> 01:10.279
Dead!

01:10.321 --> 01:12.406
Just like you,
I just watched you die.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.533
Guys, is anybody else
noticing the hooded slave?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.827
That's no slave.

01:24.502 --> 01:25.502
‐Wolf. ‐Owl!

01:25.544 --> 01:27.046
Much obliged.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.547
Thank you.

01:28.631 --> 01:29.799
‐Tiger. ‐Owl!

01:29.882 --> 01:31.133
My good friend.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.176
How are you alive?

01:32.301 --> 01:34.637
Dingo plucked me
from a Biotic necro chamber.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.931
I've been tortured,
in and out of consciousness

01:37.056 --> 01:38.057
for about three weeks.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.309
So, that means you must be...

01:40.434 --> 01:42.061
AvoidTheTunnel.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.312
Welcome to our time.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.940
The greatest warrior in history?

01:46.065 --> 01:47.066
This wee boy?

01:47.149 --> 01:49.151
I'm going to 69 with him?

01:49.193 --> 01:50.569
Yeah, I have to
explain this again,

01:50.695 --> 01:52.321
that makes sense.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.872
So when I told Kronish his
future to get him on the boat,

02:01.914 --> 02:05.835
it put a fork into
the space‐time continuum.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.713
This is a fork, by the way.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.090
So, in your timeline,
you didn't take the bridge

02:11.132 --> 02:12.216
to steal the TTD?

02:12.258 --> 02:13.134
No.

02:13.259 --> 02:15.011
No, we took the tunnel
but it was a trap.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.262
DMC gas.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.365
They picked us off one by one
until we dropped to our knees

02:18.389 --> 02:19.890
just choking on death.

02:20.016 --> 02:22.768
Biotics have a mutated p36
immunosuppressant gene

02:22.893 --> 02:24.478
that renders them immune
to all poisons.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.646
I know, Owl.

02:25.730 --> 02:26.957
I actually used
that same principle

02:26.981 --> 02:28.774
to get all my coworkers
to shit themselves

02:28.899 --> 02:29.775
in their formal wear.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.485
So the bridge was also a trap?

02:31.527 --> 02:32.737
I mean, we were always doomed.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.464
This whole time I thought
I'd made the wrong call

02:34.488 --> 02:36.657
but there was no
right call to make.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.371
Well, I...

02:42.413 --> 02:43.873
I'm relieved.

02:43.956 --> 02:44.999
That is a load off.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.877
I mean, just fell right off me.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.731
So we kill Kronish,
blow up the building

02:50.755 --> 02:51.915
with all his research inside,

02:51.964 --> 02:54.216
we escape, no innocents die,
future saved.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.760
‐Yeah. ‐I'm confused,

02:55.885 --> 02:59.013
and maybe it's because I
haven't slept for 4,000 fingers,

02:59.138 --> 03:01.515
but why are we planning
an infiltration op

03:01.640 --> 03:02.975
when there are only five of us

03:03.017 --> 03:04.737
and we have enough nukes
to level this city?

03:04.769 --> 03:06.479
No, no, no nukes.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.022
We're doing this lean and clean,

03:08.147 --> 03:09.231
from a moral standpoint.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.650
Since when are you
anti blowing shit up?

03:11.734 --> 03:14.362
Truth be told, I'm transitioning
out of demolitions.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.155
I'm really more
of a chef these days.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.531
What the fuck's a chef?

03:17.656 --> 03:19.241
You see what I had to deal with?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.159
Quick question.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.244
Since we are
in possession of a TTD,

03:22.286 --> 03:24.288
why not go back to when
Kronish was a newborn?

03:24.413 --> 03:27.124
Babies are supposedly
soft and helpless,

03:27.249 --> 03:30.002
quite killable,
almost unfairly so.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.004
Perfect, easy skull smash.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.005
No.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.590
No, no baby killing.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.221
I don't know who
these two face pirates are,

03:40.262 --> 03:42.765
but you're not the Tiger
who took an anal rod to the gut,

03:42.848 --> 03:44.725
and you're not the Wolf
who took a nosedive

03:44.767 --> 03:46.018
into a firebog.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.603
We went through this, Dingo.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.772
The small alteration
in the space‐time continuum

03:49.855 --> 03:51.524
brought them to
a new spectral plane.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.525
It's not that complicated.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.527
No, not that, they've changed.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.903
Hey, you watch your rat hole.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.464
I have half a mind
to come over there

03:57.488 --> 03:58.965
and wash it out
with soap, young lady.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.866
Well, joke's on you,
I don't know what soap is.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.535
Owl, why did you eat
my olive tapenade

04:02.660 --> 04:03.911
with your bare hands?

04:04.036 --> 04:06.038
The serving spoon
was right in the dish!

04:06.163 --> 04:07.873
Hey, man, I just
learned what a fork is.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.625
Okay, all right,
all right, look.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.002
I see what's
going on here, okay?

04:12.044 --> 04:14.130
Some of us are from Timeline A,

04:14.171 --> 04:15.756
others from Timeline B,

04:15.798 --> 04:17.507
but we're all here
for the same reason.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.552
We can't have these
factions tearing us apart.

04:19.635 --> 04:23.639
What we need right now,
more than anything,

04:23.681 --> 04:25.766
is to come together.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.123
Am I supposed to
tag in or something?

04:31.147 --> 04:32.290
‐Charging up. ‐Complete charged.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.691
Charge that battery.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.317
‐Yeah, yeah.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.694
Stop avoiding the tunnel.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.321
‐Get down here. ‐.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.573
Okay, tension released.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.699
‐Wolf? ‐Check.

04:41.824 --> 04:42.658
‐Dingo? ‐Check.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.826
‐Owl? ‐What are you doing

04:43.909 --> 04:46.287
‐after this mission?
‐Gonna call that a check.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.913
Future Man?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.624
I'm fucking you
with your own dick.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.669
Okay, to business.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.147
There's going to be
a lot of security

04:55.171 --> 04:57.423
and we're not getting anywhere
without hand scan access.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.746
There's biometric hand scanners

04:58.799 --> 05:00.050
throughout the building.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.928
Lucky for us,
I got us a set of prints.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.556
Okay, Alpha Team will clear
civilians from the building,

05:05.639 --> 05:07.016
drawing out Biotic forces.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.643
Only problem is,
it's a suicide mission.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.396
One of us is gonna have
to be sacrificed.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.815
Looks like Destiny
has found her destiny.

05:14.940 --> 05:15.941
This is not a drill.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.652
All personnel must
evacuate immediately.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.200
Meanwhile, Bravo and Charlie,

05:24.325 --> 05:25.826
they're gonna enter
from underground.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.042
Bravo is gonna set charges

05:33.167 --> 05:34.418
throughout the building...

05:40.674 --> 05:43.052
while Charlie
goes deep into the core,

05:43.177 --> 05:45.554
using his genius
to kill the power.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.438
Opening the
impenetrable security doors,

05:54.563 --> 05:57.525
giving us access
to Kronish himself.

05:58.651 --> 06:01.070
It's been an orange, soldiers.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.197
Wait, orange?

06:03.322 --> 06:04.949
Honor, it's been an honor.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.662
I love you.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.125
Is he all right?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.877
He's a genius,
it's how they are.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.271
Once we get
the signal from Charlie

06:18.295 --> 06:19.296
that the doors are open,

06:19.421 --> 06:20.881
Alpha Team will blow Destiny,

06:20.923 --> 06:22.883
killing all the Biotics
in the lobby.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.802
That will give us a window
of a few minutes

06:24.927 --> 06:26.554
before reinforcements jump in.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.305
We use it to rendezvous
at Kronish's lab,

06:28.389 --> 06:30.641
kill Kronish,
set the final charges,

06:30.683 --> 06:32.393
and jump back to the future.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.771
Um, where do I go at that point?

06:35.813 --> 06:37.123
You're coming
with us, aren't you?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.566
To the future, no.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.943
I can't‐‐I mean,
I have my whole life here.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.696
‐What life? ‐Burn!

06:43.821 --> 06:45.781
No, I mean, I gotta go
and make things right

06:45.823 --> 06:49.201
with my parents and...

06:49.326 --> 06:51.579
That's all I can think of
right now, but stuff!

06:51.662 --> 06:53.205
Then you sneak out
as a civilian.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.291
Or maybe as a janitor.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.043
Yeah, I guess that
makes the most sense.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.630
World's greatest warrior
posing as a lowly janitor.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.674
Where does your brilliance
end, AvoidTheTunnel?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.175
I wouldn't drink that,

07:05.259 --> 07:08.512
it's like 10,000 volts
to your brain.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.264
Right, right.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.458
All right, all
the "innocent" people

07:14.560 --> 07:16.520
who we "can't let die" are out.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.189
Can we blow this shit up now?

07:19.315 --> 07:21.692
All right, Alpha's
ready to blow‐‐

07:21.775 --> 07:23.694
wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.698
No, we are not clear, we are‐‐.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.326
What the fuck?

07:30.409 --> 07:32.161
One fucking youngling?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.204
The fate of humanity's
in the balance here,

07:34.330 --> 07:35.998
what are you doing?

07:36.040 --> 07:36.874
No.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.293
I gotta get her outta there.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.794
The fuck you do.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.648
What do you think
your future's gonna be like?

07:43.672 --> 07:44.798
I don't know.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.027
It'd be just as strange for me
as it would be for you.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.385
Nothing to do but adapt.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.487
Yeah, it's easy for you to say,

07:49.511 --> 07:51.180
everywhere you go
everyone loves you.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.306
That they do.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.933
But hey, don't sell
yourself short.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:04.526 --> 08:05.819
Yeah.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.280
Way to find the weak
axis of the I‐beam.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.574
See, adapting already.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.580
Go.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.170
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Tiger?

08:23.295 --> 08:25.172
You talk funny,
you care about younglings,

08:25.297 --> 08:27.132
and you don't smell
like dirt anymore.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.343
This time has turned
you into a monster.

08:29.385 --> 08:32.261
And why do you keep
touching that strangle chain?

08:32.388 --> 08:33.639
No, no, no!

08:33.722 --> 08:36.015
Dingo, do not take my baby!

08:39.895 --> 08:43.732
"You'll always be
a member of the family"?

08:43.774 --> 08:47.736
"Love, Estelle
and Elias Kronish"?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.418
Yeah, you know,
when you read it out loud,

08:49.488 --> 08:50.906
it doesn't sound great.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.624
You got my payment
there, Whiskers?

09:05.587 --> 09:06.880
There's supposed to be four.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.216
What do you want,
they're cracking down!

09:09.258 --> 09:10.718
Got my intel?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.850
Stuart Gavin Camillo.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.644
What have you gotten
yourself mixed up with?

09:20.728 --> 09:21.770
Who are you talking to?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.980
Wait, let me guess,

09:23.021 --> 09:25.274
one of your disappearing
time travel buddies.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.109
What a fucking lunatic.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.909
Well, well, well.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.746
The pupil has become the master.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.432
Who would have thought
I had a knack for explosives?

09:40.456 --> 09:42.458
Not me, I never believed in you.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.710
I thought you were weak
and had bad plans.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.086
Yeah, I've heard that before.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.607
But you've been more
dedicated to this mission

09:49.631 --> 09:51.759
than anyone else.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.510
I want you to know,

09:53.635 --> 09:56.096
if you did come
to the future with us,

09:56.138 --> 09:58.015
I'd take care of you

09:58.098 --> 09:59.641
like you took care of us.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.395
‐Wow, Wolf. ‐I know.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.527
All right.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.365
You know, all I can think
about since I murdered myself

10:15.407 --> 10:16.468
is that I don't
belong in this time

10:16.492 --> 10:17.743
any more than you guys do.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.286
I feel like a man out of time.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.913
‐lt's a weird feeling, right?
‐Yeah.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.499
It's probably why
I did all that coke.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.959
I'm just kidding, I did
that because it was awesome.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.630
You know what?

10:29.755 --> 10:30.756
I'm gonna do it.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.639
I'm gonna go with you guys
back to the future.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.888
My days of being a janitor...

10:40.641 --> 10:41.642
they're over.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.352
All right.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.521
Bravo's at the Kronish door.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.356
Charlie, what's your ETA?

10:50.359 --> 10:54.404
Physics, inertia,
why have you forsaken me?

10:57.157 --> 10:58.033
Owl?

10:58.116 --> 10:59.660
Come in, Owl.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.747
Owl, are you there?

11:05.374 --> 11:06.708
"Yes, how may I help you?"

11:06.750 --> 11:08.877
"Yes, I believe I'm
supposed to have an orgasm."

11:08.961 --> 11:10.254
"Yes, right this way.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.880
Will this orgasm do?"

11:11.964 --> 11:14.007
"Yes, it will!"

11:14.132 --> 11:16.009
Is... Owl coming?

11:16.134 --> 11:18.387
‐No, he's been myrmed. ‐Again?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.389
God damn necro chamber.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.225
Every freaking timeline.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.894
A myrm eats its way through
your brain lobe by lobe.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.521
If he's having
an orgasm this intense,

11:27.646 --> 11:30.983
it can only be because the myrm
is chewing on his amygdala.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.861
That's the brain's clit.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.112
Yeah.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.781
So you went back to the '40s
to slit his throat as a baby,

11:37.906 --> 11:39.241
that part makes sense.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.243
‐Then what? ‐Well, then...

11:41.285 --> 11:43.745
one thing led to another
and you know how it goes.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.622
I kinda ended up raising him.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.500
Was that before or after
you sent him on the floaty box

11:48.625 --> 11:49.877
with his secret charging mate?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.254
It's called a boat
and it was after.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.381
Or before, depending
on how you view time.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.383
How many chances have you had

11:56.508 --> 11:58.635
to kill Kronish and not done it?

12:01.263 --> 12:03.515
‐Yeah.
‐The answer should be zero,

12:03.640 --> 12:04.892
you goddamn traitor.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.894
I'm not following
your plans anymore.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.228
I'm in charge now.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.282
Sweetie, you gotta
get outta here.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.909
The grown‐ups are playing.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.160
Go!

12:27.247 --> 12:28.832
Give me the detonator.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.850
Owl, open the goddamn doors,
I had to blow Destiny early.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.393
Dingo turned on me.

12:48.477 --> 12:49.394
We're screwed.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.646
Open those doors.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.522
It's not a sandwich,
it's a glove.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.987
Hey, free sandwich.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.038
God damnit!

13:08.163 --> 13:09.873
Fifteen brain bombs
just blew downstairs.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.376
Biotic reinforcements
are gonna be here any second.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.877
Shit.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.506
These doors must
be Israeli steel.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.007
We ain't blowing through this.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.510
Wait, you said that Kronish
doesn't let anybody

13:21.635 --> 13:22.844
into his lab, right?

13:22.886 --> 13:23.762
Yeah.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.263
But you know
what he does let in?

13:25.347 --> 13:26.848
Possums.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.892
They gotta go somewhere.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.644
Guys, the incinerator chute.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.771
‐That's our way in.
‐No, as soon as they arrive,

13:32.896 --> 13:34.749
they'll make straight for
Kronish, we'll be overrun.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.400
Yeah, but not if
you hold them off.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.835
Look, all you gotta do
is give me enough time

13:37.859 --> 13:38.860
to climb up the chute,

13:38.902 --> 13:40.737
set the final charge,
and kill Kronish myself.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.131
I appreciate your offer,
I really do,

13:42.155 --> 13:45.033
but you've got, like, what,
one kill notch on your belt?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.285
And let's be honest,
evil you did most of the work.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.745
No.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.497
No, if someone's
gonna kill Kronish,

13:50.539 --> 13:52.249
‐it should be me.
‐With that door sealed,

13:52.332 --> 13:54.876
your only exit is down
into the fire.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.253
Yeah?

13:56.378 --> 13:57.713
It's a suicide mission.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.880
It's a one‐way ticket.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.633
No coming back,
no do‐over, no tomorrow.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.198
‐You're gonna die.
‐Yeah, okay, look,

14:03.260 --> 14:05.345
I had it at "suicide."

14:07.014 --> 14:10.017
Look, when you guys invited
me to come to your future,

14:10.142 --> 14:11.244
that meant everything to me.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.370
All right,
but that's your world,

14:12.394 --> 14:13.270
that's not mine.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.622
And this world
isn't mine either,

14:14.646 --> 14:15.772
it's Joosh's.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.359
Destiny isn't something
that just arrives

14:19.401 --> 14:21.528
on your doorstep
in a wooden box from Japan.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.964
It's something that
you seize in a moment,

14:22.988 --> 14:24.031
a moment where you realize

14:24.156 --> 14:25.407
you have to murder/suicide

14:25.532 --> 14:27.034
your former boss and mentor.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.371
This is why you
came back for me.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.334
I can do this.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.889
Okay.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.141
Okay, look,
just wait for my signal.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.893
When that thing goes green,

14:52.976 --> 14:54.227
that means Kronish is dead

14:54.269 --> 14:55.589
and the final charge
has been set.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.898
Then you guys get
the fuck back to the future

14:57.981 --> 15:00.233
and do not come back
for me no matter what.

15:00.275 --> 15:04.112
All right, if this works,
you cannot risk undoing it.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.655
That's time travel 102.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.035
We'll never forget
what you did here.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.412
You're not Future Man.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.581
You're something much better.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.458
You're Josh "Foo‐terman."

15:16.500 --> 15:19.002
It's Futterman but I get‐‐

15:22.464 --> 15:24.633
‐Okay. ‐Okay.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.762
I know we'll never get
a chance to switch dicks back,

15:28.887 --> 15:30.388
but I'm cool with that.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.140
It was never about the dick.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.893
It's about the warrior's mane,

15:34.976 --> 15:37.145
and you earned every last hair.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.156
That's a goodbye.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.761
Okay.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.642
Hey, Manuel, don't you know
the building's being evacuated?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.018
What the fuck you doing?

16:17.144 --> 16:18.270
Clear the building.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.272
Lo siento, mi amigos.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.358
Mi trabajo es muy importante.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.904
Puck shot!

16:27.988 --> 16:28.988
Gut knife!

16:32.033 --> 16:35.162
Gut knife, gut knife,
fucking gut knife!

16:35.245 --> 16:36.371
Fuck you!

16:40.709 --> 16:42.002
Science wand!

16:48.508 --> 16:49.843
One more for the gobulator.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.094
Okay, let's not kid ourselves.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.637
Yeah, you're right.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.015
Fuck.

16:55.098 --> 16:58.018
So much for stealth mode.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.936
We gotta draw them
away from the door.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.815
I thought this would be easier.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.453
Why didn't I just play Madden?

17:23.292 --> 17:24.294
Fuck.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.047
Go!

17:31.134 --> 17:32.427
I'm hit!

17:39.935 --> 17:41.436
No!

17:58.662 --> 17:59.829
Fuck.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.124
Mr. Futterman.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.294
I've been expecting you.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.630
My God, you're evil now.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.551
God damnit.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.904
Why couldn't you have
just been happy

18:14.928 --> 18:16.054
eating your conch fritters?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.555
But I was, Josh.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.932
I was!

18:19.015 --> 18:20.058
As happy as a conch.

18:20.183 --> 18:22.686
Which is like a clam
only much more delicious.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.437
Leslie and I were
living our dream

18:24.521 --> 18:26.189
far, far away from here

18:26.273 --> 18:29.067
until one windless, fateful day

18:29.150 --> 18:31.695
just north of the Isle of Lamu.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.780
My dearest Leslie brushed
against a rusty nail

18:33.822 --> 18:35.573
and contracted
a staph infection.

18:35.657 --> 18:36.825
Simple, treatable,

18:36.950 --> 18:40.704
but we were a five‐day sail
away from the nearest hospital.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.539
‐ln Somalia. ‐God.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.750
By the time we reached dry land,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.753
the love of my life
expired right in front of me

18:48.795 --> 18:50.672
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.174
Please, you have to
make this easier for me.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.176
But there was something
I could do about it.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.261
You told me!

18:56.303 --> 18:58.179
The power to eradicate pain
and disease forever

18:58.305 --> 18:59.264
lay within me.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.658
I could make it so that
no one ever had to watch

19:00.682 --> 19:02.809
a loved one be taken away
from them ever again.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.061
How could I not pursue
such a noble path?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.447
What's the point?

19:15.572 --> 19:16.823
Just let me.

19:21.077 --> 19:25.040
You know, I don't remember
Dingo being such an asshole.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.167
Yeah, she was right though.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.296
We have changed.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.008
And for the better.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.760
I like who we've become.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.054
Which is why it sucks
we're about to die.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.566
Wait, maybe we don't have to.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.569
Maybe it's time for...

19:54.694 --> 19:56.321
Beaver's razor.

19:58.823 --> 19:59.908
I'm sorry about Leslie,

19:59.949 --> 20:01.659
I know that you
loved him so much.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.329
And you guys used to
really get after it sometimes.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.499
But the truth is,
every time and every timeline,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.417
your work leads to
the creation of the Biotics

20:09.542 --> 20:10.668
who destroy all of mankind.

20:10.794 --> 20:14.005
No, I kept the research,
all my research right here

20:14.047 --> 20:16.674
under this roof,
shared it with no one!

20:16.758 --> 20:17.884
I will never do that.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.428
I am dedicated to good,
to ending pain.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.807
I know that you are,
but this is already happening.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.810
I've tried really,
really, really hard

20:26.893 --> 20:27.894
not to kill you.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.188
Okay, it's been
my number one goal.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.690
I've tried to change you,
I've tried to control events,

20:32.774 --> 20:35.443
but it doesn't work.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.570
This is where we end up.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.280
You're wrong, Josh.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.701
‐I've been careful.
‐lt doesn't matter

20:43.827 --> 20:47.205
how careful you've been, okay?

20:47.288 --> 20:48.915
Look!

20:48.998 --> 20:51.668
Don't pretend you don't see
what's happening down there.

20:51.751 --> 20:57.173
This is the army
that your cure created.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.634
I wanted to heal the world.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.889
Build a legacy
like my fraternity brother,

21:04.931 --> 21:07.058
Blapple founder Lamar Price.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.268
I know you did.

21:09.561 --> 21:14.023
And in another life, you were
another kind of great man

21:14.065 --> 21:16.568
where you were strong and caring

21:16.651 --> 21:18.069
and warm and supportive.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.822
And that's what makes
this so much harder.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.579
It's now or never, Wolfie.

21:27.662 --> 21:28.580
Okay!

21:28.621 --> 21:29.914
Brain bombs or not.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.670
Say hello to
your little friends.

21:43.553 --> 21:46.306
You're not a killer,
are you, son?

21:46.389 --> 21:48.933
Today I am.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.768
And you have to die.

21:53.146 --> 21:58.067
Tomorrow, to demonstrate
my breakthrough to the world,

21:58.151 --> 22:00.445
I was going to inject myself

22:00.528 --> 22:03.281
with a needle
filled with microdoses

22:03.323 --> 22:08.453
of 100 of the world's
deadliest diseases,

22:08.578 --> 22:12.040
and then, dramatically,

22:12.123 --> 22:15.001
save myself with my cure.

22:16.294 --> 22:21.883
It would have been
fantastic theater.

22:21.925 --> 22:26.012
Tonight's performance
will have a different ending.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.547
Woo.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.426
That stings.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.930
We broke the Beaver's dam.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.015
Biotic flood comes next.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.688
Tell me...

23:16.771 --> 23:20.775
about the man you used to know.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.193
The dancer.

23:33.830 --> 23:34.872
Shit.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.916
I really thought
that was gonna work.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.378
And every year,

23:40.420 --> 23:42.255
you would do this goofy toast

23:42.297 --> 23:45.550
and hold up these
delicious chocolate balls

23:45.675 --> 23:47.051
that you named after yourself.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.887
So...

23:49.929 --> 23:51.764
whimsical.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.828
Help.

24:20.918 --> 24:24.255
I don't expect anyone
to understand what I've done.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.257
Please believe me
when I tell you,

24:26.299 --> 24:28.885
I'm not the person
they're saying I am

24:28.926 --> 24:32.055
or even the person
that you think that I am.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.934
I'm someone else entirely.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.186
I know that sounds confusing

24:38.269 --> 24:40.313
and I wish that
I could explain it.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.193
But what I know to be true

24:45.318 --> 24:47.570
is a burden I have
to carry alone.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.905
Maybe not for that long

24:48.946 --> 24:52.909
or maybe for
the rest of my life.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.203
All I can do, in my own way,

24:55.328 --> 24:56.829
is try to make things right.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.165
I think that's a lot of money.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.876
Cupcake, we're going home.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.897
Sometimes I feel like
I've spent my whole life

25:04.921 --> 25:07.048
pretending to be a hero,

25:07.131 --> 25:09.676
so when the time came
to be one in real life,

25:09.759 --> 25:11.052
I went for it.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.679
I really did.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.931
Which is why I have to go.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.309
‐I love you. ‐Joosh!

25:18.393 --> 25:20.395
Owl, Owl, are you there?

25:20.436 --> 25:22.689
Thirst hyped, brain plunged!

25:22.814 --> 25:24.691
‐Skippy‐di‐bop!
‐Owl, do you copy?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.155
‐Skippy‐di‐bop.
‐Owl, listen to me, okay?

25:31.197 --> 25:32.573
You need to cut
the power right now

25:32.699 --> 25:34.033
to the possum incinerator chute.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.703
Shut down the power to
the possum chute right now!

25:36.786 --> 25:38.639
Right now, you have to do it
or I'm gonna burn alive.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.039
Do you understand me,
do you copy?

25:43.167 --> 25:44.919
‐Skippy‐di‐bop. ‐Good enough.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.923
Fuck.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.017
I don't wanna die!

26:07.525 --> 26:08.693
I'm not dead!

26:14.824 --> 26:15.825
Thanks, Owl.

26:42.894 --> 26:44.687
I did it!

26:48.149 --> 26:49.776
You did it?

26:49.817 --> 26:53.321
Well, you mind if
I quote you on that?

27:02.163 --> 27:04.248
Check and mate.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.418
I don't think
that piece moves like that.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.670
Right, that's the horsey.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.548
No, that's the pawn.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.550
Speaking of pawns,

27:14.675 --> 27:17.887
I take it no word from
your time traveling pals?

27:17.929 --> 27:21.682
Hey, look, I blew up that
building completely on my own.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.142
You sat through the whole trial.

27:23.184 --> 27:24.310
Some friends.

27:24.393 --> 27:27.188
Leave you locked up while
they're free to robo‐surf

27:27.313 --> 27:30.691
and hunt sport gators
in a beautiful unknown future.

27:30.817 --> 27:35.029
No, this is
what I signed up for.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.281
And I'm free.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.451
In here and in here.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.997
Well, I better get going.

27:45.039 --> 27:48.876
The widow Santiago's
coming over for dinner.

27:48.918 --> 27:53.756
Pretty soon her belly's
gonna be swollen with meatloaf.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.675
Vince, are you...

27:55.800 --> 27:56.926
are you sweet on her?

27:57.051 --> 27:59.804
Time heals all wounds,
Futterman.

27:59.887 --> 28:01.556
By the way,

28:01.639 --> 28:04.684
I clipped this article for you.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.769
Looks like your folks
are putting good use

28:06.811 --> 28:08.312
to your Euros.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.654
Well.

28:21.325 --> 28:26.038
It ever bother you that everyone
thinks you're batshit crazy?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.040
I know the truth.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.376
That's all that matters.

28:30.418 --> 28:34.255
Reminds me of someone
I used to know.

28:34.297 --> 28:36.299
Vincent Skarsgaard.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.013
Next week, Future Man.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.017
On the door, coming out.

28:47.305 --> 28:53.578
