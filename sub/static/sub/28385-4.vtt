I guess I just wanted
to apologize.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.667
Well, this sounds promising.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.660
You are the superior Officer,

43:45.760 --> 43:48.320
and you know the streets
better than I do.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.617
I shouldn't be questioning you.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.386
You're damn right about that.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.999
You're a strange bird, Lee.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.067
How's that?

44:00.160 --> 44:02.264
Well, for starters,

44:02.360 --> 44:04.920
most cops don't dig around
in the guts of dead men.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.822
Well...

44:08.400 --> 44:10.061
I spent my whole life
on a farm.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.341
Cows start dying,
you gotta look inside,

44:13.440 --> 44:14.429
see what's killing them.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.943
People aren't animals.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.149
Aren't we?

44:21.880 --> 44:24.860
We've just got these
bigger brains that trick us

44:24.960 --> 44:26.382
into thinking
we're something else.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.862
Here you are.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.143
Put it on my tab.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.304
Look, you're a good kid,

44:39.400 --> 44:41.743
and you're gonna be a fine cop.

44:41.840 --> 44:44.024
And I should know.
I used to be one.

44:45.800 --> 44:47.745
One of these days,

44:47.840 --> 44:51.344
we'll get ourselves reassigned
out of Chinatown

44:51.440 --> 44:53.704
and we'll go Off and do
some real police work.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.119
All right?

44:55.200 --> 44:56.383
Sounds good, Sergeant.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.186
But until then,

44:58.280 --> 45:00.305
you keep your head down.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.709
You do what you have to
to survive.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.582
This Chinatown beat,

45:08.680 --> 45:12.901
there's about 100 different
ways it can bury you,

45:13.000 --> 45:14.979
on both sides of the line.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.908
Do you understand?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.627
I do.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.029
NO, you don't.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.429
Not yet.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.549
But you will.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.379
(MEN YELLING IN THE DISTANCE)

45:30.800 --> 45:33.143
I'm sorry to leave you
before you finish your drink,

45:33.240 --> 45:36.266
but I've got an appointment.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.537
MAN: Here we go.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.460
We're gonna do black,
all right?

45:55.120 --> 45:56.109
Deal me in.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.622
You know Fitz says
I can't give you

45:57.720 --> 45:58.789
any more markers, Bill.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.666
The buy-in is $10.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.261
Here's 30.
