ABBY LEE:
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.503 --> 00:03.370
The show has to go on.

00:03.370 --> 00:04.771
<i>In light of her legal woes,</i>

00:04.771 --> 00:07.040
<i>Abby is an emotional wreck,</i>

00:07.040 --> 00:09.142
but this is not fair
to our kids.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.611
ASHLEE: Abby, did you
come all the way

00:10.611 --> 00:13.313
to sit in the car,
or are you gonna come in?

00:13.313 --> 00:14.615
It seems like money has
somehow corrupted her,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.483
<i>so she's only fixated</i>
<i>on the money.</i>

00:16.483 --> 00:18.886
You didn't bring costumes,
you don't do your job!

00:19.953 --> 00:23.557
First place goes
to entry number 74.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.193
(crowd cheering)

00:26.193 --> 00:28.795
You don't want to be here,
just go home. Go.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.098
If you want to sit here and let
her play her (bleep) games,

00:31.098 --> 00:33.333
then you can,
so (bleep) you all!

00:33.333 --> 00:34.601
I'm not coming back
as long as she's there.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.403
<i>Kalani will probably</i>
<i>come home, too.</i>

00:36.403 --> 00:37.905
ABBY LEE:
Brynn is taking the lead.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.840
BRYNN: <i>Maddie is coming back,</i>
<i>and I really have to show</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:41.808
that I want to stay
on this team.

00:41.808 --> 00:42.910
Well, Maddie's back...

00:44.711 --> 00:46.647
... so I think
Brynn is on probation.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.150
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:50.150 --> 00:52.252
Hello! I have somewhere
I would rather be.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.155
JILL: <i>Abby has to get</i>
<i>her passion back.</i>

00:55.155 --> 00:58.692
Be a grown‐up, do your job.
You're a joke.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.361
JILL: Why did you not watch
Maddie on the <i>Ellen</i> show?

01:01.361 --> 01:03.397
We've thrown out a bunch of
stuff. How do you really feel?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.666
Well, whatever you're throwing
out is gonna your kid and you

01:05.666 --> 01:06.967
kicked off my team.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.035
<i>Maddie, you're back.</i>

01:08.035 --> 01:09.570
This should be
better than ever.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.471
MADDIE: <i>Abby is not acting</i>
<i>the same she usually does.</i>

01:11.471 --> 01:12.806
ABBY LEE:
Maddie, it's so blah.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.575
She used to talk about
us being jealous.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.109
The tables have turned.

01:17.811 --> 01:18.946
She's envious of your kid.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.684
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:23.684 --> 01:25.352
♪ ♪

01:28.822 --> 01:31.191
JOJO:
<i>Maddie, you're back!</i>

01:31.191 --> 01:32.225
Maddie, you're back forever!

01:32.225 --> 01:33.627
Are you excited
that you're back?

01:33.627 --> 01:34.995
I'm excited to be back,

01:34.995 --> 01:37.464
but I'm not excited for
the stressful competition.

01:39.232 --> 01:40.767
Yeah, exactly.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.937
Even though I did have
so much fun filming the movie,

01:43.937 --> 01:45.505
<i>it's so great to be back.</i>

01:45.505 --> 01:49.176
<i>And, to be honest,</i>
<i>I haven't really been here,</i>

01:49.176 --> 01:50.377
so I don't know what's up

01:50.377 --> 01:53.146
<i>with Abby, but I do</i>
<i>miss my friends.</i>

01:53.146 --> 01:55.382
And it's so great to just be
back with the girls.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.886
I'm just so excited that
Maddie's back and we're, like,

01:59.886 --> 02:01.121
a complete group again.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.923
Yeah, me, too.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.125
JILL:
<i>Now that Maddie's back,</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:07.194
<i>hopefully this will make</i>
<i>Abby happy.</i>

02:07.194 --> 02:09.529
Last week, she didn't want
to be with the team,

02:09.529 --> 02:10.964
she didn't want to be here.

02:10.964 --> 02:11.965
I'm not working anymore.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.200
The show has to go on. I mean...

02:13.200 --> 02:14.501
Why?

02:14.501 --> 02:16.470
<i>I understand</i>
<i>that Abby is dealing</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:17.471
with legal issues,

02:17.471 --> 02:18.472
<i>but, you know what,</i>

02:18.472 --> 02:20.240
<i>she needs to hold it together.</i>

02:20.240 --> 02:23.510
<i>Maybe because</i> Maddie's <i>here,</i>
<i>Abby will show up for work.</i>

02:24.945 --> 02:26.179
Hello.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.849
Hi.
Hey!

02:28.849 --> 02:30.817
You look very nice.
ABBY LEE: Oh, thank you.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.286
HOLLY: <i>Abby showed up.</i>
<i>And got dressed.</i>

02:33.286 --> 02:34.821
<i>Maybe our fearless leader</i>
<i>is back.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:37.157
But, honestly,
I'm not holding my breath.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.826
Last week, we found you
in your pajamas,

02:39.826 --> 02:44.398
not ready to do pyramid, so this
week, we find you ready to go.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.465
Is it because Maddie's back?

02:45.465 --> 02:46.466
No.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.736
HOLLY:
You told me,

02:49.736 --> 02:51.838
"I don't have the passion. I'm
not interested in this anymore."

02:51.838 --> 02:53.507
Has that changed?

02:54.708 --> 02:57.044
Do I have the passion
to teach dance,

02:57.044 --> 02:58.378
to choreograph, to create?

02:58.378 --> 03:00.280
Absolutely.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.882
That is my passion.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.484
It's not about quitting because
I'm afraid of hard work.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.987
I'm not.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.855
Then, Abby, what is it about?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.358
All those times where you
didn't want to be here,

03:11.358 --> 03:12.926
you didn't want the kids here,
you didn't want to do it,

03:12.926 --> 03:13.994
you didn't want to show...

03:13.994 --> 03:16.096
What is it about,
and‐and has that changed,

03:16.096 --> 03:18.365
so now we can
have Abby back?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.369
ABBY LEE:
It's financial issues.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.237
I think all of you kids...

03:24.237 --> 03:27.140
respect that and
you know that.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.375
It's the way it is.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.610
<i>These moms don't have any idea</i>

03:30.610 --> 03:32.612
the kind of stress
that I'm under,

03:32.612 --> 03:36.016
<i>emotionally, mentally</i>
<i>and financially.</i>

03:36.016 --> 03:39.820
<i>I've had years of success,</i>
<i>and now it's falling apart.</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:44.491
<i>It's hard to continue to do</i>
<i>my job because I don't feel</i>

03:44.491 --> 03:46.827
that I am putting
my best foot forward.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.664
<i>But my parents</i>
<i>never let me quit,</i>

03:50.664 --> 03:53.300
<i>so I need to suck it up</i>
<i>and put on a happy face.</i>

03:53.300 --> 03:55.435
Let's get finished.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.604
Okay, congratulations, girls.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.474
<i>It was a very successful</i>
<i>trip to Arizona.</i>

04:00.474 --> 04:01.942
Maddie, you're back.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.210
GIRLS:
Yay.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.012
You were doing a movie.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.048
You were a winner

04:08.048 --> 04:09.516
up until that point.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.917
When you came back

04:10.917 --> 04:12.853
and went and came back and went,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.154
you didn't win.

04:14.154 --> 04:18.158
Second place, 3A, "Bond Girl."

04:18.158 --> 04:20.594
The Abby Lee Dance Company!

04:20.594 --> 04:22.095
(crowd cheering)

04:22.095 --> 04:24.264
You need to get into the groove,

04:24.264 --> 04:27.701
and you need to be my number‐one
girl out there every week again.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.870
Do you understand that?
Yes.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.872
All right.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.774
<i>This week, my eyes</i>
<i>are gonna be on Maddie.</i>

04:33.774 --> 04:36.109
It's gonna be her
that gets the correction

04:36.109 --> 04:38.712
or her that gets reprimanded.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.480
<i>Getting to the top</i>
<i>is one thing,</i>

04:40.480 --> 04:43.150
<i>but staying on top is tougher.</i>

04:43.150 --> 04:45.185
Without her dance training,

04:45.185 --> 04:47.354
Maddie wouldn't be getting
these opportunities.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.356
Did you see her do the <i>Ellen?</i>

04:49.356 --> 04:50.490
Did you see the video?

04:50.490 --> 04:52.058
I didn't.
I sent it to you.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.261
ABBY LEE: I'm just busy.
I'm just doing other stuff.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.363
MELISSA: <i>This week,</i>
<i>Maddie was on the</i> Ellen <i>show,</i>

04:56.363 --> 04:57.831
<i>and Abby didn't watch it.</i>

04:57.831 --> 04:59.900
<i>It's a little bizarre</i>
<i>for Abby to act like this,</i>

04:59.900 --> 05:01.902
<i>but it is what it is.</i>

05:01.902 --> 05:04.304
But if Abby doesn't want
to watch her, shame on her.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.205
Pyramid.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.109
On the bottom
of the pyramid,

05:09.109 --> 05:11.978
we have... JoJo...

05:13.780 --> 05:14.981
... Nia...

05:16.416 --> 05:17.984
... Maddie...

05:20.387 --> 05:21.988
... and Mackenzie.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.192
In the group dance,

05:25.192 --> 05:26.660
you all really...

05:28.428 --> 05:31.565
... pulled it down a notch.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.700
ASHLEE: <i>So Maddie's at</i>
<i>the bottom of the pyramid.</i>

05:33.700 --> 05:35.202
I think I like this new Abby

05:35.202 --> 05:36.636
<i>that's hard on Maddie.</i>

05:36.636 --> 05:38.672
This could be
good news for Brynn.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.007
ABBY LEE:
And next up...

05:41.007 --> 05:43.343
Kendall.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.580
You did well.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.415
<i>To me, it looked like</i>
<i>you loved the dance</i>

05:48.415 --> 05:50.483
and that you loved
what you were doing.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.985
And then we have Brynn.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.487
Regardless of what
the judges thought,

05:54.487 --> 05:57.224
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>beautiful to look at.</i>

05:57.224 --> 05:59.492
<i>You were a good representative</i>
<i>for the Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

05:59.492 --> 06:01.695
And on top of
the pyramid,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.296
our overall high‐score winner,

06:03.296 --> 06:04.764
who did not let

06:04.764 --> 06:06.466
any of her mother's actions
or words

06:06.466 --> 06:08.869
faze her whatsoever...

06:10.904 --> 06:12.072
... Kalani.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.540
(girls cheering)

06:13.540 --> 06:15.108
ABBY LEE:
I thought you were

06:15.108 --> 06:18.845
<i>absolutely gorgeous on stage,</i>
<i>and it paid off.</i>

06:18.845 --> 06:20.714
Kira is not back.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.717
At the end of the
competition, I don't know

06:23.717 --> 06:26.753
what got into your mother,
but she gave me an ultimatum:

06:26.753 --> 06:28.321
Kalani or Brynn.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.591
No, I'm not coming back
as long as she's there.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.561
I don't really do ultimatums.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.930
JILL: I think she was hoping
you would tell Ashlee and Brynn

06:36.930 --> 06:38.932
their time here is done,

06:38.932 --> 06:41.468
because Brynn was
replacing Maddie.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.370
Maddie is physically
standing here.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.871
So Brynn's the swing.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.172
But we never had
a swing before.

06:46.172 --> 06:47.974
Well, I know.
Wouldn't it be nice if we did?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.676
JILL: So does that mean
she's off probation?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.011
ABBY LEE:
No.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.079
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>a problem with Brynn at all,</i>

06:53.079 --> 06:54.848
<i>but the mother?</i>

06:54.848 --> 06:56.650
The jury's still out.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.552
<i>Ashlee just rubs people</i>
<i>the wrong way.</i>

06:59.552 --> 07:01.621
ASHLEE: <i>Kalani's not</i>
<i>as good as she used to be.</i>

07:01.621 --> 07:03.189
What?!

07:03.189 --> 07:05.191
I do think Kendall could've
played it up a little bit more.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.393
Uh, I'm sure
you do think that.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.161
ASHLEE:
Kendall is old news.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.462
Don't talk about other kids!

07:09.462 --> 07:11.731
ABBY LEE:
<i>So I put Brynn on probation</i>

07:11.731 --> 07:15.068
<i>because of her mother,</i>
<i>and that's a shame,</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:17.604
because when Brynn steps
into that room to dance,

07:17.604 --> 07:18.939
<i>she's beautiful.</i>

07:18.939 --> 07:22.175
<i>Is Brynn maybe the next Maddie?</i>

07:22.175 --> 07:24.978
<i>That's up to her mother.</i>

07:24.978 --> 07:26.346
This week, we
are traveling

07:26.346 --> 07:27.847
to San Diego, California,

07:27.847 --> 07:30.050
and we will
be attending

07:30.050 --> 07:31.851
Dream National
Dance Competition.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.820
(girls cheering)

07:33.820 --> 07:36.690
Okay, now you already know
that there's gonna be

07:36.690 --> 07:38.224
incredible kids there.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.693
Right?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.795
You need to
step it up.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.197
So be motivated right now.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.566
We have...

07:46.566 --> 07:48.368
three solos.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.107
Nia, you will be doing

07:54.107 --> 07:56.376
a musical theater
routine...

07:56.376 --> 07:57.844
Oh, I love musical theater.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.612
(girls cheering)

07:59.612 --> 08:03.350
...entitled "Money Makes
the World Go Down."

08:03.350 --> 08:06.252
(laughter)

08:06.252 --> 08:08.321
All right.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.123
Mackenzie, you will be
doing a solo.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.795
The name of your routine
is "Don't Take My Fire."

08:15.795 --> 08:17.497
(imitates sizzling)

08:19.499 --> 08:22.302
My next solo...

08:22.302 --> 08:23.336
is going to JoJo.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.038
Yay.
(girls cheering)

08:25.038 --> 08:26.740
Thank you.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.941
You are a nurse.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.410
But you are a nurse

08:30.410 --> 08:31.678
that kills.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.046
Ooh!
JESSALYNN:
What?

08:33.046 --> 08:37.017
And the name of your piece
is appropriately titled "Mercy."

08:40.787 --> 08:42.322
<i>JoJo, Nia and Mackenzie</i>

24:24.129 --> 24:26.565
<i>Abby went on and on and on</i>

24:26.565 --> 24:28.600
<i>about how there are</i>

24:28.600 --> 24:30.169
gonna be amazing kids here.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.403
<i>But you know what?</i>

24:31.403 --> 24:33.706
<i>Even if Abby's</i>
<i>not giving her best,</i>

24:33.706 --> 24:36.175
they just need to go out
and do their job.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.277
ABBY LEE:
JoJo, Nia, Mackenzie!

24:38.277 --> 24:39.979
While you're putting
your makeup on, let's think.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.814
Straight legs,
feet pointed.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.916
All those things
that sometimes you do wrong

24:43.916 --> 24:46.585
can't be wrong today.

24:46.585 --> 24:48.587
HOLLY: <i>Nia, JoJo, and Mackenzie</i>
<i>all have solos this week</i>

24:48.587 --> 24:50.155
<i>and Abby basically</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:51.590
put forth no effort

24:51.590 --> 24:53.092
in choreographing
any of their solos.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.061
She basically doesn't care,
but she still expects them

24:56.061 --> 24:58.230
to pull out
all the stops and win.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.833
I did notice that you missed
a name in the program.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.900
I did?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.002
Well, I didn't know

25:03.002 --> 25:04.203
if she was on the team or not,

25:04.203 --> 25:06.338
but I guess she's not listed.
JILL: Who?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.640
Brynn.
Oh, her name's not
in the program?

25:08.640 --> 25:11.110
ASHLEE: Did you in the room
though, yesterday,

25:11.110 --> 25:12.745
you said,
"Now that you're on the team‐‐"

25:12.745 --> 25:15.347
ABBY LEE:
No, I did not say that.
I was very careful

25:15.347 --> 25:16.915
in my choice of words.

25:16.915 --> 25:18.817
I said, "Now that you're here,
and you're part of our family."

25:18.817 --> 25:23.322
Brynn, you're the newest
addition to our family.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.857
ASHLEE: Well, she misunderstood
'cause she said,

25:24.857 --> 25:26.225
"Now you're part of
our family, and I'm‐‐"

25:26.225 --> 25:27.393
She is.
She's part of my family.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.395
I adore her.
It's fine.
Okay.

25:29.395 --> 25:30.729
I misunderstood what you said.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.065
JESSALYNN: She's not even
in the program with the girls

25:33.065 --> 25:34.400
as listed as a team member,

25:34.400 --> 25:35.701
and actually I was happy
to see that,

25:35.701 --> 25:37.369
because she tells everyone

25:37.369 --> 25:39.505
that she's on the team,
and she's not.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.106
And that she's better
than all of our kids.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.775
I never said
she was better.
Every day you do.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.710
I said, "Of course, when we're
here trying to make the team,

25:44.710 --> 25:46.378
I'm gonna talk her up."
I mean, why would I not?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.747
JESSALYNN:
'Cause it's called being humble.

25:48.747 --> 25:51.083
Ashlee is like
every other young mom.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.684
They don't know when to zip it.

25:52.684 --> 25:56.555
<i>This is exactly why I need</i>
<i>for her to be on probation.</i>

25:56.555 --> 25:59.558
<i>You don't need to brag</i>
<i>about your child to us.</i>

25:59.558 --> 26:01.593
<i>Let her talent speak</i>
<i>for itself.</i>

26:01.593 --> 26:05.464
You just sit back and relax
and keep your mouth shut.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.699
Okay, JoJo.

26:07.699 --> 26:11.270
There's ballet technique
in this routine.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.338
You have the turns in the dance.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.340
We're utilizing your best skill.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.110
You can't get out there
and bobble.

26:18.110 --> 26:22.247
Mackenzie, you're going up
against JoJo.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.649
Your mothers are in here saying

26:23.649 --> 26:26.552
they want more choreography,
they want difficulty.

26:26.552 --> 26:27.886
We want to give it to you,

26:27.886 --> 26:29.588
but when we asked you
or we give you the step

26:29.588 --> 26:32.558
and you can't do it,
then we change it.

26:34.393 --> 26:37.830
Nia, you are closer
to embarking on a career

26:37.830 --> 26:42.034
in musical theater as an adult
than the rest of the group.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.368
You've done your homework.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.537
I've done my homework

26:45.537 --> 26:47.906

<i>stunning,</i>

<i>but Abby's choreography</i>

32:10.629 --> 32:11.530
No.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.731
ASHLEE:
No?

32:12.731 --> 32:14.266

32:14.266 --> 32:17.169

That's a new argument.
She's there.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.374

You thought quick on your feet.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.075
All right, that's a good one.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.378
So then how do your really feel

32:26.378 --> 32:28.447
Are you... feel like
she's beyond you?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.081

a bunch of stuff.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.317
How do you really feel?

32:32.317 --> 32:33.452
Well, whatever
you're throwing out

32:33.452 --> 32:34.486
is gonna get
your kid and you

32:34.486 --> 32:36.087
kicked off
my team.

32:36.087 --> 32:38.623
If there's one thing
that I can tell you,

32:38.623 --> 32:39.958
back me up.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.394
Because I can do wonderful
things for your kid,

32:42.394 --> 32:44.896

of nothing for your kid.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.899

32:49.267 --> 32:50.435
That was interesting.

32:50.435 --> 32:51.436
ASHLEE: It wasn't
really that bad.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.605
No, it was pretty bad.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.140
(laughing)

32:55.140 --> 32:57.642
When we were calling
her out about Maddie...

32:57.642 --> 32:59.878
I think it's a good sign for me

32:59.878 --> 33:01.780
that Maddie's not the
advertisement anymore.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.516
I think that's a good sign
for Brynn, personally,

33:04.516 --> 33:06.785
because I don't think
that Abby's gonna promote

33:06.785 --> 33:09.254
her next girl from somebody
who's already been here,

33:09.254 --> 33:11.923
because she could have pulled
any of your guys' kids and said,

33:11.923 --> 33:13.325
"You're the next Maddie,"
but she didn't.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.327
JILL: You still think
that she brought Brynn in here

33:15.327 --> 33:18.296
to be the next Maddie?

33:18.296 --> 33:20.198
The first day we walked in, Abby
said, "Welcome to the team,"

33:20.198 --> 33:21.533
and handed her Maddie's jacket.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.369
MELISSA: She didn't hand her
Maddie's jacket.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.204
She said, "You could wear it
until Maddie gets here."

33:26.204 --> 33:28.540
And you took
"welcome to the family"

33:28.540 --> 33:31.543

40:03.067 --> 40:04.435
HOLLY:
I was very happy

40:04.435 --> 40:05.870
with Nia's performance
today as a soloist.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.139
I still don't think it was
competitive for a teen division,

40:08.139 --> 40:10.341
but she did well.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.710
So was it a competition routine?

40:12.710 --> 40:14.512
Probably not.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.281
Could it help you
get a Broadway job?

40:16.281 --> 40:17.615
Yes.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.417
HOLLY:
As a teacher,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.719
if you have a high standard,

40:21.719 --> 40:24.555
those kids will push
themselves past the limit

40:24.555 --> 40:26.958
because there is an
expectation that you have set

40:26.958 --> 40:29.227
as a leader, like,
"Let me see what you can do."

40:29.227 --> 40:30.929
But if you set the bar so low,

40:30.929 --> 40:32.497
kids will achieve

40:32.497 --> 40:34.532
at the bare minimum.

40:34.532 --> 40:37.135
That is slapping me in the face,

40:37.135 --> 40:39.437
my vocation and what I do.
I'm not setting the bar low.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.472
You don't even show up

40:41.472 --> 40:42.640

40:43.942 --> 40:45.143
HOLLY:
<i>Wow, did Abby just say</i>

40:45.143 --> 40:46.477
<i>she's sorry?</i>

40:46.477 --> 40:49.113
Because if she did,
she's basically admitting

40:49.113 --> 40:50.982
<i>she gives Nia</i>
<i>subpar choreography,</i>

40:50.982 --> 40:52.617
<i>and that is shocking.</i>

40:52.617 --> 40:54.452
ABBY LEE:
Just like your kids

40:54.452 --> 40:55.653
have gotten older,
or they're changing,

40:55.653 --> 40:56.654
or they want this,

40:56.654 --> 40:58.623

40:58.623 --> 41:00.692
maybe I do, too.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.427

41:02.427 --> 41:05.797

ABBY LEE:
<i>Did I do my best this week?</i>

41:10.468 --> 41:11.602

41:11.602 --> 41:13.304
<i>Am I exhausted? Yes.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:14.806

41:14.806 --> 41:15.974

41:15.974 --> 41:18.309
<i>I'm sick and tired of fighting.</i>

41:18.309 --> 41:20.211
HOLLY:
If you consume yourself

41:20.211 --> 41:22.413
with all of this by fixating on,

41:22.413 --> 41:24.015
"I should have,
could have, would have,"

41:24.015 --> 41:26.551
you really will fall prey
to the seven deadly sins.

41:26.551 --> 41:29.253
You, yourself, will be
ultimately consumed by that,

41:29.253 --> 41:30.755

Maybe.
