06:04.425 --> 06:05.424
- Boo!
- Oh!

06:06.460 --> 06:08.293
Oh, my goodness.

06:08.295 --> 06:09.861
You scared me half to death.

06:11.865 --> 06:13.632
That's not funny.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.800
Well, it's a little funny.

06:15.802 --> 06:17.068
You ass.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.437
Well, I am
my mother's daughter.

06:20.439 --> 06:22.006
- Hmm.
- Why are you yelling?

06:22.008 --> 06:24.441
I told you I was
going for a walk.

06:24.443 --> 06:25.909
No, you didn't.

06:27.046 --> 06:29.712
Yeah, yeah, I remember

06:29.714 --> 06:32.548
you said you were going
swimming and then...

06:32.550 --> 06:33.449
Then what?

06:34.819 --> 06:35.818
I thought maybe,

06:37.989 --> 06:40.223
I thought that maybe
something happened.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.623
Mom, I am right here.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.758
Oh, I know.

06:44.094 --> 06:45.560
Never mind.

06:45.562 --> 06:49.765
Let's go, let's
go get up and go back inside.

06:51.168 --> 06:53.502
I'm lazy, you
should be lazy too.

06:53.504 --> 06:55.369
Maybe it's just
because I'm younger.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.604
I don't need all the rest.

06:56.606 --> 06:58.939
Oh, you're younger.

06:58.941 --> 07:00.341
- Yeah, I don't know.
- That has nothing

07:00.343 --> 07:01.309
to do with it.

07:01.311 --> 07:02.310
That is just numbers.

07:02.312 --> 07:03.577
Means nothing.

07:03.579 --> 07:07.414
Wow, that was
very deep and profound.

07:07.416 --> 07:11.418
Now, let's see how fast that
rickety old body can run.

07:15.490 --> 07:17.057
Hey, cheaters never win!

07:40.680 --> 07:42.245
- Oh!
- Uh, ha, ha!

07:43.048 --> 07:44.948
- Whoo!
- Roselee!

07:44.950 --> 07:46.516
Roselee, open up.

07:46.518 --> 07:47.751
Open up.

07:47.753 --> 07:49.986
What's
the magic word?

07:51.256 --> 07:53.756
I am not playing
that game with you.

07:53.758 --> 07:57.226
Kinda looks like you're
gonna play this game.

07:57.228 --> 07:59.261
Oh, princess.

07:59.263 --> 08:01.530
Uh, you know, I could, oh.

08:02.934 --> 08:04.867
What? You ain't
got nothing on me, sheriff.

08:04.869 --> 08:09.070
Mm, I could post drab picture

08:09.072 --> 08:10.338
of you on Facebook.

08:10.340 --> 08:11.606
Oh, that's too easy.

08:11.608 --> 08:15.477
You wouldn't dare.

08:15.479 --> 08:16.411
You're right.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.112
'Cause you know why?

08:18.114 --> 08:20.614
I've got this photo of
you with your braces on

08:20.616 --> 08:21.915
and your clarinet.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.417
- Oh, and that pretty little
- Oh, okay.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.786
sweater you wore that
gran-gran made for you.

08:25.788 --> 08:28.756
You made me play that
stupid instrument, though.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.156
That's a dirty pull.

08:31.493 --> 08:34.394
Hmm, princess,
I'm the sheriff,

08:34.395 --> 08:36.962
and the sheriff says "Open
up" and the word is blackmail.

08:38.533 --> 08:39.365
Hi there.

08:40.668 --> 08:41.600
- Thank you.
- There, are you

08:41.602 --> 08:42.601
proud of yourself?

08:42.602 --> 08:44.836
Using my childhood against me.

08:44.838 --> 08:46.037
Shameful.

08:46.039 --> 08:48.306
But effective.

08:48.308 --> 08:51.209
And also, just one more thing.

08:51.211 --> 08:52.310
What?

08:52.312 --> 08:53.644
I got the shower first!

09:30.280 --> 09:31.179
I don't know.

09:32.916 --> 09:34.682
I mean, I want to.

09:34.684 --> 09:35.616
You know that.

09:36.853 --> 09:37.885
Of course you do.

09:39.088 --> 09:39.954
I don't know.

09:41.590 --> 09:44.291
You don't think it's
kinda, kinda weird?

09:50.165 --> 09:51.631
Look, I'm not saying that.

09:53.835 --> 09:55.868
Well, you're the
one that saw her.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.871
You heard her talking
about her daughter.

09:58.873 --> 10:00.206
Oh yeah, I did.

10:04.045 --> 10:06.311
And this is how it starts.

10:07.848 --> 10:10.215
This is how it always starts.

10:10.217 --> 10:11.182
All right, Matt.

10:12.652 --> 10:14.152
You need to relax.

10:15.522 --> 10:17.554
You know, I think I need
to be a little more careful.

10:17.556 --> 10:18.455
So do you.

10:19.592 --> 10:22.960
That place creeps
me the fuck out.

10:24.096 --> 10:26.163
The noises and the screams.

10:26.165 --> 10:27.297
I just...

10:29.400 --> 10:30.566
Oh my God.

10:32.337 --> 10:34.337
I can still hear 'em.

10:34.339 --> 10:36.072
Oh please, listen.

10:37.675 --> 10:39.208
I know what you want.

10:40.945 --> 10:42.878
I know what you need
more than anyone.

10:43.981 --> 10:45.180
Sis has your back.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.616
- Always.
- Yeah.

10:49.353 --> 10:51.253
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

10:51.255 --> 10:52.521
No, no.

10:53.723 --> 10:55.422
They should be gone tomorrow.

10:57.326 --> 10:59.493
I'm already one step
ahead of you, sis.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.329
- How's that?
- I checked the list.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.566
They're here
through the weekend.

11:08.637 --> 11:09.536
Oh, wow.

11:12.407 --> 11:13.339
There he is.

11:14.809 --> 11:17.176
My little opportunist.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.713
Always looking for
that right angle.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.581
Hmm?

11:23.551 --> 11:24.449
You know what?

11:25.786 --> 11:29.154
Are you ready for the
best weekend of our lives?

11:31.558 --> 11:32.456
Oh yeah.

12:28.711 --> 12:31.510
Mom,
what are you doing?

12:31.512 --> 12:33.512
What does it look I'm doing?

12:33.514 --> 12:36.248
It's fucking eight at night.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.783
Language.

12:37.785 --> 12:40.486
For fuck's sake, I raised
you better than that, Lee.

12:41.555 --> 12:43.822
It's our third night here.

12:43.824 --> 12:45.890
It calls for shots.

12:45.892 --> 12:48.326
Not knitting or tea drinking

12:48.328 --> 12:50.862
or 12th century cabinet making.

12:50.864 --> 12:53.497
Fun, fun, fun!

12:53.499 --> 12:56.200
It calls for tea, darling.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.636
I don't know.

12:58.638 --> 12:59.770
I feel like staying warm

12:59.772 --> 13:02.473
and tucking in early.

13:02.475 --> 13:06.576
Well thank
you, Captain Excitement.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.277
You can do what you want,

13:08.279 --> 13:10.413
but not me.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.849
Lee, would you
put some clothes on.

13:14.119 --> 13:15.618
No.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.153
Lee!

13:18.022 --> 13:18.954
Oh my God.

13:18.956 --> 13:21.289
Are those your pajamas now?

13:21.291 --> 13:23.925
Yeah, sometimes I wear
even less than this.

13:23.927 --> 13:25.827
It's hot in here.

13:25.829 --> 13:27.829
And I'm fine just like this.

13:27.831 --> 13:28.730
Mm.

13:30.066 --> 13:31.532
You know that I had trouble
keeping your diapers on

13:31.534 --> 13:32.733
when you were a child.

13:32.735 --> 13:33.701
What if somebody comes
to the door, huh?

13:33.703 --> 13:36.137
It's late.

13:36.139 --> 13:37.371
Nobody cares about boobies.

13:37.373 --> 13:38.739
We're in Oregon.

13:38.741 --> 13:41.307
Remember when we went
country fair last year

13:41.309 --> 13:43.376
and there was
boobies everywhere.

14:50.006 --> 14:51.639
Mom?

14:51.641 --> 14:52.540
Mom?

14:53.609 --> 14:58.679
Mom?

15:09.190 --> 15:10.256
Oh, sorry.

15:17.031 --> 15:19.197
Hmm, that looks good.

17:08.132 --> 17:08.998
You want one?

17:10.734 --> 17:12.034
Oh, all right.

17:12.036 --> 17:13.836
Just one.

17:13.838 --> 17:14.637
Promise.

17:20.676 --> 17:21.643
What's wrong, Lee?

17:23.280 --> 17:27.048
Mom, where you
mad when I left?

17:28.185 --> 17:31.485
I mean, I know Dale
wasn't right for me.

17:32.788 --> 17:35.289
I know now that he
wasn't right for me,

17:35.291 --> 17:37.524
but where you mad?

17:37.526 --> 17:40.728
No, princess, I was not mad.

17:40.730 --> 17:43.062
I was concerned about you.

17:43.064 --> 17:45.565
You left for year with this guy

17:45.567 --> 17:47.000
that I didn't know,

17:47.002 --> 17:50.603
and what I did know,
I did not like.

17:51.907 --> 17:56.008
Well, I mean, learn
from experiences, right?

17:56.010 --> 17:56.875
Mm.

17:56.877 --> 17:58.110
Mm.

17:58.112 --> 18:01.146
It was good for me, though.

18:01.148 --> 18:04.249
Being out in the middle
of nowhere, Saskatchewan.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.518
Made me realize that it
wasn't the right decision.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.187
And then you bring me out here

18:10.189 --> 18:13.457
to the middle of
nowhere to bond.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.861
I think I've really had
my fill of wilderness.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.262
Oh, you needed this, baby.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.499
I needed this, you know?

18:22.501 --> 18:24.167
Really just needed to reconnect.

18:26.471 --> 18:28.772
Plus, I know you're
having a great time.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.741
I am not the great
party buddy, I agree,

18:32.743 --> 18:35.444
but you know, this is our time.

18:35.446 --> 18:37.212
We get to connect
with each other.

18:37.982 --> 18:39.014
Thanks, Mom.

18:39.884 --> 18:42.450
You're welcome.

18:42.452 --> 18:45.954
And you know, I
lied to you, huh?

18:45.956 --> 18:47.188
About what?

18:47.190 --> 18:48.923
I think I'm gonna have
to have another shot.

18:50.927 --> 18:53.961
Ooh,
I hate this stuff,

18:53.963 --> 18:55.963
but I'm gonna drink it.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.733
Bottoms up, as they say.

19:01.770 --> 19:02.869
Oh my God.

19:02.871 --> 19:04.271
Smooth, huh?

19:04.273 --> 19:05.638
I love you.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.706
That's really awful.

19:10.979 --> 19:11.978
Pour! Pour!

19:12.981 --> 19:14.313
Pour some more!

19:15.583 --> 19:16.816
- Oh, Jesus.
- One for me,

19:16.818 --> 19:17.882
- How do you do that?
- though.

19:17.884 --> 19:19.517
Okay, one for you.

19:19.519 --> 19:21.586
One for you, one for me.

19:21.588 --> 19:23.121
- Let's see, hmm.
- Ooh!

19:24.458 --> 19:26.024
Yeah, we better slow down.

19:26.026 --> 19:28.493
Seriously, we better slow down.

19:28.495 --> 19:29.660
Okay, just one more shot.

19:29.662 --> 19:31.295
And then we'll slow down.

19:31.297 --> 19:33.063
Then we'll slow down.

19:33.065 --> 19:34.832
Yeah, I'll pour one for me

19:34.834 --> 19:36.200
and then one for you.

19:39.438 --> 19:40.671
Oh, boy.

19:40.673 --> 19:42.105
It's a little
better this time.

19:42.107 --> 19:44.807
A little
smoother each time, right?

19:44.809 --> 19:45.708
Mm-hmm.

19:46.845 --> 19:49.946
Oh, that cinnamon
goes down so well.

19:49.948 --> 19:51.180
Here's one for you.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.984
'Cause the alternative is tea.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.419
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, here.

19:57.421 --> 19:58.387
No tea.

21:49.757 --> 21:51.023
Murder.

21:55.729 --> 21:56.595
Murder.

21:58.031 --> 21:58.630
Murder.

22:01.902 --> 22:02.801
Deceiver.

22:07.406 --> 22:08.305
Deceiver.

22:09.442 --> 22:10.341
Murder.

22:17.082 --> 22:17.981
Murder.

27:32.137 --> 27:33.069
Oh.

27:33.071 --> 27:34.805
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

27:34.807 --> 27:36.406
It's okay.

27:36.408 --> 27:37.641
I think I got 'em.

27:37.643 --> 27:38.842
Oh.

27:38.844 --> 27:42.411
Ah, so, um, you
staying around here?

27:42.413 --> 27:45.047
A tent or a lake house?

27:45.049 --> 27:46.615
- Oh.
- Just come

27:46.617 --> 27:48.517
for the nature?

27:48.519 --> 27:51.320
Actually, I'm here
with my daughter.

27:51.322 --> 27:52.887
We're just here for a week.

27:54.191 --> 27:56.391
We're only here for another
couple days, actually.

27:56.393 --> 27:58.159
It's been a great week.

27:58.161 --> 28:01.596
Except for the rain but
it's Oregon, you know.

28:01.598 --> 28:02.997
Yeah, mm-hmm.

28:02.999 --> 28:04.498
I'm sorry, I'm Sophie.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.532
Sophie Palmer.

28:05.534 --> 28:07.234
- Oh, Carla.
- Oh.

28:07.236 --> 28:08.702
I'm here with my brother Matt.

28:08.704 --> 28:10.337
- Oh, that's good.
- He should be

28:10.339 --> 28:11.505
around here,
actually, somewhere.

28:11.507 --> 28:12.806
He just went for more water.

28:12.808 --> 28:14.041
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah,

28:14.043 --> 28:15.175
you can never have enough.

28:15.177 --> 28:17.243
- Yeah.
- After one day,

28:17.245 --> 28:18.511
we ran out.

28:18.513 --> 28:20.279
Yeah.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.515
- Hey, Carla.
- Yeah.

28:22.517 --> 28:24.050
Look at that.

28:24.052 --> 28:25.017
Hi, Matt.

28:26.588 --> 28:27.487
Right on cue.

28:30.157 --> 28:31.490
Hey Carla, you coming?

28:32.759 --> 28:33.792
Or are you walking?

28:36.163 --> 28:38.196
Do you need a ride?

28:38.198 --> 28:40.198
Oh, okay.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.765
Yeah, thanks.

28:56.248 --> 28:57.447
Hi there, I'm Matt.

28:59.017 --> 29:02.051
Matt, this is our
new friend, Sophie.

29:03.255 --> 29:04.286
Nice to meet you.

29:05.122 --> 29:06.588
Nice to meet you.

29:06.590 --> 29:08.290
Where to, Miss Sophie?

29:08.292 --> 29:11.994
Oh, um, I am just over there.

29:11.996 --> 29:13.729
Once you start driving,

29:13.731 --> 29:14.663
when we get to the path,

29:14.665 --> 29:15.831
I'll just start walking.

29:15.833 --> 29:16.864
I'll tell you when.

29:17.634 --> 29:19.500
I'm with my daughter.

29:19.502 --> 29:21.302
You don't say?

29:21.304 --> 29:22.670
With your daughter.

29:23.473 --> 29:25.907
Oh, oh my God, Matt.

29:25.909 --> 29:27.208
You are such a pig.

29:28.577 --> 29:30.477
You'll have to
excuse my brother.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.045
He was raised with wolves.

29:33.448 --> 29:37.551
So, are you staying in that
first lake house over there?

29:37.553 --> 29:38.585
Oh yeah.

29:38.587 --> 29:39.853
How did you know?

29:41.188 --> 29:43.289
Oh, um, well,

29:43.291 --> 29:45.057
I saw you heading
out this morning

29:45.059 --> 29:46.926
when I was on my walk.

29:46.928 --> 29:48.827
It's beautiful.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.596
Mm, thank you.

29:51.699 --> 29:56.100
Um, if you don't
mind me asking,

29:56.102 --> 29:57.835
what happened a few nights ago?

30:02.275 --> 30:04.308
I don't now. What do you mean?

30:04.310 --> 30:06.877
Well, Matt and I
were asleep that night.

30:06.879 --> 30:09.613
Our tent isn't
too far from here.

30:09.615 --> 30:13.517
And we heard this horrible cry.

30:14.887 --> 30:17.053
Well yeah, we thought it was
like a wolf or something.

30:17.055 --> 30:18.421
- Mm.
- We were afraid

30:18.423 --> 30:19.722
and we started walking towards-

30:19.724 --> 30:20.957
- You were afraid.

30:20.959 --> 30:23.593
For the record,
I was not afraid.

30:23.595 --> 30:25.027
We were afraid,

30:25.029 --> 30:27.797
and we started walking towards
it with our flashlights.

30:27.799 --> 30:30.665
Yeah, in a classic white
person move from a horror film.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.500
"Hey, it's sound dangerous.

30:32.502 --> 30:33.835
It's dark and we're alone.

30:33.837 --> 30:34.970
Let's go check it out."

30:36.239 --> 30:38.540
We wanted to see
if we could help.

30:38.542 --> 30:41.008
Someone was clearly in distress.

30:41.010 --> 30:44.111
Um, but I was afraid
it was a bunch

30:44.113 --> 30:45.713
of crack heads or something.

30:46.882 --> 30:49.683
I feel bad knowing
it was you guys.

30:50.820 --> 30:52.151
So, um...

30:55.657 --> 30:56.522
What happened?

30:58.193 --> 31:00.460
Are you sure it
was the right place?

31:00.462 --> 31:02.128
Oh, positive.

31:04.632 --> 31:06.832
No, nothing happened.

31:06.834 --> 31:11.737
I was with my daughter
and we were drinking,

31:11.739 --> 31:14.072
but there was no loud music.

31:15.609 --> 31:18.776
Everything was pretty
low key, actually.

31:18.778 --> 31:20.611
No, it was the one
'cause there was this guy

31:20.613 --> 31:21.746
and he was loud.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.451
No, you have to be wrong.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.221
Mm.

31:31.223 --> 31:35.759
I mean, everything was fine.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.929
My daughter can be loud

31:39.931 --> 31:43.532
but she doesn't
sound like a man.

31:43.534 --> 31:44.400
Neither do I.

31:45.736 --> 31:49.104
Anyhow, maybe we'll
stop by for a BBQ

31:49.106 --> 31:51.006
with you and your daughter.

31:52.375 --> 31:55.109
Yeah, you're leaving
when again, in two nights?

32:09.758 --> 32:10.657
Sophie?

32:11.527 --> 32:12.459
Shall we go?

32:13.562 --> 32:17.730
You know what, I think
I'm just gonna walk.

32:17.732 --> 32:20.232
I'm sorry, thank
you so much, though.

32:20.234 --> 32:21.467
Hey, I'll tell you what.

32:21.469 --> 32:24.537
We'll stop by later
and check with you

32:24.539 --> 32:26.539
on that BBQ, if
that sounds good?

32:26.541 --> 32:30.942
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
that'd be great.

32:30.944 --> 32:33.011
Roselee loves to party.

32:33.013 --> 32:35.814
And I'm sure she'd
really like the company.

32:35.816 --> 32:38.650
- Thank so much you guys.
- Yeah, she will.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.918
Okay well, bye.

32:40.920 --> 32:43.087
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

32:44.523 --> 32:46.256
We are on our way.

32:49.862 --> 32:51.395
Yes.

35:09.356 --> 35:10.288
Oh no.

35:11.959 --> 35:12.891
Lee!

35:12.893 --> 35:15.060
Oh, why did you lock the door?

35:16.295 --> 35:17.895
Oh, why would you lock the door?

35:17.897 --> 35:19.363
Like we're out in the
middle of nowhere.

35:19.365 --> 35:20.798
Nothing's gonna happen.

35:20.800 --> 35:21.899
Lee!

35:21.901 --> 35:23.167
- Boo!
- Oh.

35:23.169 --> 35:24.935
Oh, my God!

35:24.937 --> 35:25.736
How many times do
I have to tell you

35:25.738 --> 35:27.805
not to sneak up on me?

35:27.807 --> 35:30.640
At least one more
time, Miss Palmer.

35:30.642 --> 35:31.875
Oh,

35:31.877 --> 35:33.443
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

35:33.445 --> 35:36.546
Yes, can you
please open the door?

35:36.548 --> 35:38.014
I left it opened and unlocked

35:38.016 --> 35:39.415
so you could get back in.

35:40.484 --> 35:42.317
Oh, do not tell me that.

35:42.319 --> 35:44.052
I do not have the keys.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.188
You have to have them.

35:46.190 --> 35:48.056
No, Mom, you do.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.726
The wind must have
blown the door closed.

35:50.728 --> 35:52.226
No!

35:52.228 --> 35:54.295
Oh, that means the
keys are in there.

35:54.297 --> 35:55.796
- I don't know.
- What are we gonna do?

35:55.798 --> 35:57.531
I don't know what
to tell you, Mom.

35:57.533 --> 35:58.699
Oh, man.

35:58.701 --> 36:00.268
Oh, okay.

36:00.270 --> 36:02.937
Let me, let me just
think a minute.

36:02.939 --> 36:04.170
Uh, oh my gosh.

36:04.172 --> 36:05.105
I got it.

36:05.107 --> 36:06.139
- What?
- Just wait.

36:06.141 --> 36:09.109
Where are you going?

36:57.021 --> 36:58.020
Oh!

36:58.022 --> 36:59.221
- Ha, ha!
- Oh, God.

36:59.223 --> 37:00.423
Tada!

37:00.425 --> 37:02.124
You worry way too much.

37:02.126 --> 37:03.726
The window was open.

37:04.528 --> 37:06.661
Wait, what's wrong?

37:06.663 --> 37:07.796
Nothing.

37:08.765 --> 37:10.031
Did you take your pills today?

37:10.033 --> 37:12.968
Yes! I took my fucking pills!

37:12.970 --> 37:14.069
Jesus!

37:14.071 --> 37:15.603
Okay, jeez, Mom.

37:16.472 --> 37:17.404
Gosh.

37:17.406 --> 37:19.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:20.776 --> 37:21.675
I'm sorry.

37:23.012 --> 37:25.546
I just met these
people on the way back.

37:25.548 --> 37:27.247
Oh, well that's good, right?

37:27.249 --> 37:29.515
You made friends and...

37:29.517 --> 37:31.918
I want you to be
straight with me, okay?

37:33.021 --> 37:36.155
Did anything happen when
I was away yesterday?

37:36.157 --> 37:40.125
Like, did anything strange
like loud noises or...

37:40.127 --> 37:41.293
But you were here, Mom.

37:41.295 --> 37:43.762
Yeah, but when I was away.

37:43.764 --> 37:46.598
Well, when you were in
town, nothing happened.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.968
No screaming or orgies, nothing.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.636
Why? What did they say?

37:52.872 --> 37:54.472
Never mind.

37:54.474 --> 37:55.940
Oh.

37:55.942 --> 37:58.075
I knew, I knew, I
knew, I knew it.

37:58.077 --> 37:59.276
It's okay. It's okay.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.878
You know what, I
gonna go have a nap.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.046
- Okay?
- Yeah,

38:02.048 --> 38:03.947
that sounds like a good idea.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.382
I'm gonna go back
to the lake then

38:05.384 --> 38:06.750
and let you relax.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.852
- Okay.
- I love you, Mom.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.286
Morning, ma'am.

42:25.422 --> 42:27.022
Sheriff Roy Keeps.

42:27.024 --> 42:28.222
Tad County Sheriff's Office.

42:28.224 --> 42:30.124
This is Park Ranger,
Jennifer Ross.

42:30.126 --> 42:31.692
Ma'am.

42:31.694 --> 42:32.893
And your name?

42:38.534 --> 42:39.433
And your name?

42:41.837 --> 42:44.170
I'm Sophie Palmer.

42:44.172 --> 42:45.438
Is everything okay?

42:45.440 --> 42:47.807
That's why we're
here, Miss Palmer.

42:47.809 --> 42:50.043
You rentin' from the Grangers?

42:50.045 --> 42:53.178
Yeah, Tom and Amy are friends
of me and my daughter's.

42:54.715 --> 42:57.116
Did something happen?

42:57.118 --> 42:58.484
Did you happen to
hear a disturbance

42:58.486 --> 43:00.552
last Thursday about 10:00 pm?

43:01.489 --> 43:03.055
Maybe you were having a party.

43:04.858 --> 43:06.024
A party, a party.

43:06.026 --> 43:08.426
Look, listen, my daughter and I,

43:08.428 --> 43:13.131
we're eating and
sleeping and sunbathing,

43:13.133 --> 43:15.999
and it's all very low key.

43:16.001 --> 43:18.835
Leave your daughter
by herself at any time?

43:18.837 --> 43:20.370
I went to the store, but

43:23.509 --> 43:26.276
if anything happened,
she would have told me.

43:26.278 --> 43:28.644
Sorry, Miss Palmer,
we received a call

43:28.646 --> 43:30.246
concerning noise after hours,

43:30.248 --> 43:32.448
and it's our job to
come and ask questions

43:32.450 --> 43:35.217
to be sure that you and
your daughter are safe.

43:35.219 --> 43:37.953
We certainly don't
wanna frustrate you.

43:37.955 --> 43:39.255
We're here for your safety

43:39.257 --> 43:41.423
and for the safety of
the other residents.

43:45.462 --> 43:50.532
My daughter is
a very good girl.

43:51.534 --> 43:52.533
We all have
secrets, Miss Palmer.

43:53.869 --> 43:56.437
Kids do things sometimes
they don't wanna talk about.

43:57.606 --> 43:59.907
The type of behavior
we wouldn't expect.

43:59.909 --> 44:01.508
Mean, aggressive.

44:01.510 --> 44:03.210
Even violence.

44:03.212 --> 44:05.378
It only takes one time
to cross that line.

44:06.781 --> 44:08.181
Would it be okay if we came by

44:08.183 --> 44:09.916
and spoke to your
daughter later?

44:11.186 --> 44:12.118
Of course

44:12.120 --> 44:14.120
Of course, that would be fine.

44:15.156 --> 44:16.388
Your daughter's name?

44:59.063 --> 45:00.829
Your daughters name?

45:00.831 --> 45:01.897
Miss Palmer?

45:04.067 --> 45:05.400
It's Roselee.

45:06.269 --> 45:07.101
Thank you.

45:07.103 --> 45:08.836
Oh, of course.

45:13.276 --> 45:14.976
Miss Palmer, are you okay?

45:14.978 --> 45:16.543
Is everything okay?

45:16.545 --> 45:17.477
It's fine.

45:17.479 --> 45:20.046
It's just these migraines.

45:20.048 --> 45:21.581
Everything is fine.

45:26.588 --> 45:27.753
We'll be back later.

45:29.424 --> 45:30.890
You have a good day, ma'am.

46:04.689 --> 46:06.556
Did Sophie seem weird to you?

46:08.493 --> 46:10.326
What do you mean?

46:10.328 --> 46:11.260
Seriously?

46:13.131 --> 46:14.964
I just don't want any trouble.

46:19.636 --> 46:20.635
You mean again?

46:22.306 --> 46:24.005
Listen, sis is
only gonna be able

46:24.007 --> 46:26.942
to get you out of
bind so many times.

46:26.944 --> 46:28.509
That's a street
that goes both ways.

46:28.511 --> 46:29.710
Or did you forget that?

46:33.349 --> 46:36.851
Hey, remember the first
time we went camping?

46:38.120 --> 46:39.219
How could I forget?

46:40.255 --> 46:42.856
It was a good time, no?

46:42.858 --> 46:44.090
It was the best time.

46:48.463 --> 46:50.463
I think the mom
would be down for it.

46:51.599 --> 46:52.798
I'm into some weird shit

46:52.800 --> 46:55.467
but I get this stay the
fuck away vibe, sis.

46:59.740 --> 47:02.140
We should drop by and
see how drunk she gets.

47:03.243 --> 47:05.510
Maybe the daughter
won't even show up.

47:05.512 --> 47:09.413
And if she does, you
can have the daughter,

47:09.415 --> 47:10.681
and I can have Sophie.

47:12.118 --> 47:13.985
Hmm, and if she doesn't,

47:14.954 --> 47:18.021
well, I'm sure the three of us

47:18.023 --> 47:20.924
can have a little
bit of fun, hmm?

47:24.530 --> 47:27.429
Listen, we always
have each other.

47:29.367 --> 47:31.267
We sure do.

47:31.269 --> 47:32.935
Always and forever.

48:18.645 --> 48:19.611
Gin.

48:19.613 --> 48:21.880
You always win.

48:21.882 --> 48:23.582
Not always.

48:23.584 --> 48:25.150
Most of the time,
but not always.

48:26.954 --> 48:28.185
Uh.

48:28.187 --> 48:30.521
I'm gonna go get out of
these stinky clothes.

48:30.523 --> 48:33.757
I smell like guano
and old cheeseburgers.

48:33.759 --> 48:34.992
Yeah.

48:34.994 --> 48:36.460
Can you turn the
shower on for me?

48:36.462 --> 48:37.661
Oh, sure.

48:37.663 --> 48:38.896
Just a minute.

48:56.313 --> 48:57.212
It's on, baby.

48:58.349 --> 48:59.348
Thanks.

48:59.350 --> 49:01.483
I'm gonna go get this funk off.

49:10.193 --> 49:12.560
Oh, you forgot
your towel, baby.

49:15.864 --> 49:18.231
Here you go, sweetie.

49:18.233 --> 49:19.866
Fuck!

49:19.868 --> 49:21.434
Oh, thanks, Mom.

49:21.436 --> 49:26.506
You're welcome.

49:28.709 --> 49:29.775
Mom?

49:29.777 --> 49:30.676
Yeah.

49:37.618 --> 49:40.752
You know, I know you did
your best to protect me

49:42.255 --> 49:45.390
from Dale and from Dad.

49:48.962 --> 49:51.695
And I know it wasn't
easy for you, either.

49:55.334 --> 49:57.401
I just wanted you to know that.

49:59.004 --> 50:00.237
You're welcome, baby.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.041
They deserve what they got, boy.

50:06.110 --> 50:07.510
Nobody hurts my baby.

50:09.414 --> 50:10.413
I know, Mom.

50:13.584 --> 50:16.618
You know, I should
have done more.

50:18.955 --> 50:20.455
Part of me didn't wanna believe

50:20.457 --> 50:22.691
that what was going
on was going on.

50:23.593 --> 50:25.060
I should have been stronger.

50:27.296 --> 50:32.366
But that other part of me,

50:33.436 --> 50:38.038
I never wanna see
that part of me again.

51:05.398 --> 51:07.364
Now I can count on you, right?

51:07.366 --> 51:08.599
What?

51:08.601 --> 51:11.102
Not to pull a stunt
like you did earlier.

51:11.104 --> 51:12.536
Not to bring this woman to tears

51:12.538 --> 51:13.871
by giving her the fifth degree.

51:13.873 --> 51:15.405
I'm not gonna make
any promises, Ross.

51:15.407 --> 51:17.107
I gotta trust me gut.

51:17.109 --> 51:18.541
Your gut?

51:18.543 --> 51:22.545
Like that time you trusted
your gut with that 12 year old?

51:22.547 --> 51:24.080
Hey, he looked shifty.

51:24.082 --> 51:26.549
What do you want me
to say, I'm sorry?

51:26.551 --> 51:28.283
Okay, I'm sorry.

51:28.285 --> 51:31.320
I would like to
just have an exchange

51:31.322 --> 51:34.723
without somebody
shitting themselves.

51:34.725 --> 51:36.458
I thought I was the hard ass.

51:36.460 --> 51:38.193
Hard-headed, maybe.

51:38.995 --> 51:40.561
I hate this place.

51:40.563 --> 51:41.796
It gives me the creeps.

51:41.798 --> 51:44.899
I just wanna get in and
take care of business

51:44.901 --> 51:46.267
and get the hell out.

51:46.269 --> 51:47.401
What is it about this place

51:47.403 --> 51:49.637
that makes you so spooky, Ross?

51:49.639 --> 51:51.538
I'll tell ya sometime.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.073
Just not now.

51:53.075 --> 51:56.109
Hey, I think you need to
tell me before we go in.

51:56.111 --> 51:57.344
It isn't a short story

51:57.346 --> 51:59.212
and it isn't a story
I like to tell.

52:00.182 --> 52:03.215
Now remember, smile.

52:03.217 --> 52:04.416
I am smiling.

52:04.418 --> 52:05.684
Seriously.

52:14.362 --> 52:15.260
Palmer.

52:41.186 --> 52:43.052
- Have a seat.
- Uh-huh.

52:43.054 --> 52:44.187
Would you like a coffee?

52:44.189 --> 52:45.454
- No.
- I would like...

52:46.558 --> 52:48.191
Sure, I would love
a cup of coffee.

52:48.193 --> 52:49.425
No, ma'am. No, thank you.

52:49.427 --> 52:54.496
Okay.

53:09.779 --> 53:12.313
Miss Palmer, you have
anything to tell us?

53:12.315 --> 53:16.182
Did you get a chance to speak
to your daughter, Roselee?

53:16.184 --> 53:17.650
What do you mean?

53:17.652 --> 53:19.686
Did you get a chance
to talk to your daughter?

53:20.856 --> 53:21.988
Oh.

53:21.990 --> 53:23.590
God, no.

53:23.592 --> 53:25.625
Oh, oh, yes.

53:25.627 --> 53:29.127
She says she does not
remember anything strange.

53:29.129 --> 53:30.162
Nothing at all?

53:30.164 --> 53:31.063
No.

53:32.399 --> 53:35.100
Would you mind if we ask
her a few questions ourselves?

53:35.102 --> 53:37.202
Oh, no.

53:37.204 --> 53:38.670
Ah, she's, ah...

53:40.073 --> 53:41.839
Oh, she's in the shower.

55:28.539 --> 55:30.806
Maybe we should come back.

55:32.476 --> 55:33.608
I'll say.

55:33.610 --> 55:34.509
Oh.

55:37.748 --> 55:41.215
Miss Palmer, are you on
any prescription medications?

55:42.919 --> 55:44.719
Hey, are you okay?

55:45.555 --> 55:48.356
Oh yes, I'm, I'm, I'm...

55:48.358 --> 55:49.357
Um, no. I mean, yes.

55:49.359 --> 55:50.524
I'm, I'm fine.

55:50.526 --> 55:51.424
I'm okay.

55:54.329 --> 55:56.062
That girl must
love her shower.

55:57.165 --> 55:58.765
How much longer do
you think it'll be?

55:58.767 --> 56:01.968
Oh, oh, not very long.

56:01.970 --> 56:04.336
But you said she didn't
recall anything, right?

56:04.338 --> 56:06.972
Right, right.

56:06.974 --> 56:09.942
She, she doesn't
remember anything.

56:09.944 --> 56:11.810
What, what do you want?

56:11.812 --> 56:14.480
Miss Palmer, there's
no reason to be upset.

56:14.482 --> 56:16.247
I am not upset!

56:16.249 --> 56:17.715
Miss Palmer.

56:17.717 --> 56:19.684
- Don't hurt us!
- Miss Palmer,

56:19.686 --> 56:20.651
it's okay.

56:20.653 --> 56:22.186
We didn't mean to.

56:28.961 --> 56:30.627
It's okay, Miss Palmer.

56:30.629 --> 56:33.463
I'm sorry.

56:33.465 --> 56:34.364
I'm sorry.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.099
I'm sorry.

56:37.336 --> 56:39.168
I'm sorry, it's just my,

56:41.205 --> 56:42.538
my husband.

56:43.341 --> 56:44.240
He...

56:46.377 --> 56:47.910
Oh, I'm so sorry.

56:47.912 --> 56:49.645
It's okay.

56:54.484 --> 56:56.818
I'm gonna talk to Lee.

56:56.820 --> 56:57.986
- Okay.
- No, Miss Palmer.

56:57.988 --> 56:59.187
We'll be going.

57:00.490 --> 57:02.890
We will be going.

57:02.892 --> 57:04.158
We'll show ourselves out.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.793
Thanks again for your time.

57:05.795 --> 57:07.528
We'll stop by again tomorrow.

57:19.674 --> 57:21.074
Something's just not right.

57:21.076 --> 57:22.442
I smell it.

57:22.444 --> 57:25.812
Jesus, Roy, will
you just let it go?

57:25.814 --> 57:28.547
It's bad enough we're
dredging up abusive nightmares

57:28.549 --> 57:29.781
for that poor woman,

57:29.783 --> 57:31.550
and you're putting
the screws to her too.

57:31.552 --> 57:34.052
Something's going
on here, Ross.

57:34.054 --> 57:38.023
You're not
in Dallas anymore.

57:38.025 --> 57:41.158
This is Century Lakes.

57:41.160 --> 57:45.162
It's just simple folk
with simple lives.

57:45.164 --> 57:46.964
Maybe you're right.

57:46.966 --> 57:48.065
I can't shake it.

57:48.067 --> 57:49.333
This place.

57:49.335 --> 57:51.468
What you won't tell
me about this place.

57:52.604 --> 57:53.503
It's...

57:54.439 --> 57:55.505
I feel it.

57:55.507 --> 57:57.040
It's a darkness, a chill.

57:58.443 --> 58:00.143
I felt this one time before.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.246
I ignored it, people
paid the price.

58:05.116 --> 58:06.915
What are you talking about?

58:14.358 --> 58:16.424
It happened in Dallas.

58:18.862 --> 58:20.394
There as a call.

58:20.396 --> 58:23.297
A neighbor said he
heard screams next door.

58:23.299 --> 58:25.333
I rolled out on it.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.467
When I got there,

58:27.736 --> 58:28.969
I went up to the door.

58:28.971 --> 58:30.804
Everything was quiet.

58:30.806 --> 58:31.838
It was too quiet.

58:32.908 --> 58:33.807
I knocked.

58:34.877 --> 58:36.843
A pretty little thing
came to the door.

58:36.845 --> 58:37.944
Late 20's.

58:38.713 --> 58:40.479
Didn't have any bruises.

58:40.481 --> 58:41.447
No cuts.

58:42.517 --> 58:44.116
Big smile.

58:44.118 --> 58:46.785
I ask her, "Everything okay?"

58:46.787 --> 58:48.988
I ask her repeatedly.

58:48.990 --> 58:50.356
Over and over.

58:50.358 --> 58:52.724
I interviewed her,
five or six minutes.

58:53.627 --> 58:54.559
She assured me.

58:56.296 --> 58:57.228
It was all right.

58:59.533 --> 59:00.598
I walked away.

59:01.501 --> 59:02.599
But I knew it wasn't right.

59:02.601 --> 59:04.635
I knew something was wrong.

59:04.637 --> 59:05.736
I had that feeling.

59:06.972 --> 59:08.672
Same feeling I got here.

59:12.044 --> 59:12.943
What happened?

59:21.686 --> 59:24.854
Second call came
in later that night.

59:24.856 --> 59:25.855
I was already off duty.

59:25.857 --> 59:27.355
I didn't take it.

59:27.357 --> 59:29.925
But when it came across the
scanner as the same place,

59:32.029 --> 59:33.461
I knew it was gonna be bad.

59:34.598 --> 59:35.497
And it was.

59:37.968 --> 59:38.999
What happened?

59:42.705 --> 59:45.372
Girl's boyfriend,
he was a meth head.

59:46.809 --> 59:48.275
He was high.

59:48.277 --> 59:49.276
He took a hammer

59:50.512 --> 59:52.779
and he beat her four
year old son to death.

59:54.583 --> 59:56.916
Coroner said the boy
didn't die right away.

59:58.019 --> 01:00:00.553
Said he probably lived
an hour, maybe two.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:05.757
Second call that
came in that night,

01:00:05.759 --> 01:00:07.226
that was the girl screaming.

01:00:09.763 --> 01:00:11.230
Boyfriend took the same hammer,

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:12.431
crushed her skull.

01:00:15.868 --> 01:00:16.934
I didn't do nothing.

01:00:19.906 --> 01:00:20.871
I walked away.

01:00:24.344 --> 01:00:27.944
Ross, you might
think I'm an asshole,

01:00:29.881 --> 01:00:33.250
but I can't get that
picture of that little boy

01:00:33.252 --> 01:00:35.285
and his mama out of my mind.

01:00:39.957 --> 01:00:41.690
I'm sorry, Roy, but

01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:45.761
this is not that situation.

01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:47.496
It just isn't.

01:00:48.733 --> 01:00:49.865
I wish I had your confidence.

01:00:49.867 --> 01:00:50.732
I really do.

01:00:52.202 --> 01:00:53.334
People are dark.

01:00:54.838 --> 01:00:56.271
Everyone has a secret.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.539
Everyone, Ross.

01:01:06.315 --> 01:01:07.547
I'm sorry, Roy.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:11.418
I'm really sorry that you
had to go through that.

01:01:12.755 --> 01:01:14.620
I've seen a lot of things.

01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:17.056
Some worse that that.

01:01:17.058 --> 01:01:18.924
Your cup fills up quick.

01:01:20.995 --> 01:01:23.529
You either gotta empty
your cup or get a new one.

01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:27.198
Well, to get a fresh start,

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.901
you need to let go of your past.

01:01:30.737 --> 01:01:31.636
Hmm.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.306
You're a good woman, Ross.

01:01:35.876 --> 01:01:37.342
It's getting late.

01:01:37.344 --> 01:01:38.509
Let's get outta here.

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:19.376
It's amazing.

01:08:19.377 --> 01:08:20.243
Peaceful.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:22.412
So serene.

01:08:23.482 --> 01:08:24.515
Yes.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:25.416
It's beautiful.

01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:28.350
Almost as beautiful as you are.

01:08:28.353 --> 01:08:29.919
Oh, you're such a charmer.

01:08:29.921 --> 01:08:31.319
Oh, you're the charmer.

01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:34.323
Bloodsucking whore!

01:08:34.325 --> 01:08:36.359
I know what you did!

01:09:07.288 --> 01:09:08.188
Mom?

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:13.460
Have you not
heard that banging?

01:09:13.462 --> 01:09:14.792
What banging?

01:09:15.996 --> 01:09:18.130
Seriously, you
have not heard it?

01:09:18.131 --> 01:09:19.064
No.

01:09:19.066 --> 01:09:20.399
What are you talking about?

01:09:20.401 --> 01:09:22.667
Just give me the keys.

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:24.770
I told you earlier,
I don't have them.

01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:33.944
Open this door.

01:09:36.316 --> 01:09:37.782
Mom, come back to bed.

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.385
Oh, okay.

01:09:46.591 --> 01:09:48.291
All right, let's go back to bed.

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:49.192
Come on.

01:10:41.809 --> 01:10:44.142
This is Sheriff Keeps.

01:10:44.144 --> 01:10:45.010
Ross?

01:10:45.913 --> 01:10:46.745
Everything okay?

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.615
Lunch.

01:10:53.486 --> 01:10:54.985
You wanna have lunch with me?

01:10:59.992 --> 01:11:01.374
Yeah, sure.

01:11:01.376 --> 01:11:02.758
No, I'm on the west side of
the lake up on Ridge Road.

01:11:05.463 --> 01:11:07.497
I can be there in 20 minutes.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:12.135
Okay, see ya at the park.

01:11:14.538 --> 01:11:16.171
I'll be damned.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:30.017
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.285
Oh, look at you.

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:37.358
Jeez, did you go through
some poison ivy or something?

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:42.462
Aw, I don't know.

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.264
Maybe we should get into town.

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.733
I could ask that
Matt guy to drive us,

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:48.335
and we could get some help

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:51.704
and I could get my keys redone.

01:11:53.474 --> 01:11:55.875
Yeah, but how's
your head, better?

01:11:57.578 --> 01:11:58.978
Hmm.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.845
It's okay.

01:12:02.282 --> 01:12:04.215
It's been days
now and I don't why

01:12:04.217 --> 01:12:05.550
you don't drink anymore.

01:12:09.222 --> 01:12:10.455
Look, I'm sorry.

01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:13.324
I know, I have not
been myself lately.

01:12:14.693 --> 01:12:17.594
It's just, I can't
help with this headache.

01:12:17.596 --> 01:12:19.930
And, ow, you know what?

01:12:19.932 --> 01:12:23.500
Now I just, I
can't find my keys.

01:12:23.502 --> 01:12:25.068
I can't sleep at night.

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:27.336
Look, look, look at this.

01:12:27.338 --> 01:12:29.972
Look at this.

01:12:31.843 --> 01:12:32.942
Okay.

01:12:32.944 --> 01:12:34.677
I know that you're worried

01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:36.812
if we wait until Saturday.

01:12:36.814 --> 01:12:39.948
Um, you said your friends
were gonna be back later.

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:42.250
Why don't we just wait for them,

01:12:42.252 --> 01:12:44.786
and then we can leave
when they get back.

01:12:46.657 --> 01:12:48.390
Unless they don't come.

01:12:50.626 --> 01:12:51.892
You know what?

01:12:51.894 --> 01:12:54.795
We could, we could just

01:12:57.533 --> 01:12:59.800
pack up and leave.

01:13:00.903 --> 01:13:03.903
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

01:13:05.607 --> 01:13:09.309
Do you remember this lullaby?

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:14.446
♪ Rock a bye baby ♪

01:13:14.448 --> 01:13:18.784
♪ On the tree top ♪

01:13:18.786 --> 01:13:22.187
♪ When the wind blows ♪

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:26.157
♪ The cradle will rock ♪

01:13:27.727 --> 01:13:31.729

01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:36.801

01:13:43.141 --> 01:13:45.976
♪ Cradle and all ♪

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:08.830
Hey, come.

01:14:09.599 --> 01:14:10.565
Have a seat.

01:14:13.303 --> 01:14:14.434
Don't mind if I do.

01:14:15.437 --> 01:14:17.804
This is quite unexpected.

01:14:17.806 --> 01:14:20.407
Well, we only see each
other regarding work,

01:14:20.409 --> 01:14:23.110
so I thought why not
actually have a social visit

01:14:23.112 --> 01:14:25.644
while we can get to know
each other a little better?

01:14:25.646 --> 01:14:27.179
That's very kind of you.

01:14:29.017 --> 01:14:32.785
Turkey or turkey?

01:14:32.787 --> 01:14:35.921
I think
I'll have turkey.

01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:36.822
Turkey it is.

01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:45.830
You had it planned,

01:14:45.832 --> 01:14:47.132
that I would take turkey.

01:14:59.879 --> 01:15:01.544
That's a damn good sandwich.

01:15:01.546 --> 01:15:02.812
Did you make this?

01:15:03.681 --> 01:15:05.181
Yes, I did.

01:15:05.183 --> 01:15:07.550
They say the way
to a man's heart

01:15:07.552 --> 01:15:09.218
is through his stomach.

01:15:11.222 --> 01:15:13.989
So, why a park
ranger in Oregon?

01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:15.524
Well there are only two states

01:15:15.526 --> 01:15:17.859
that don't require you to
have a gun to be a ranger,

01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:19.761
and Oregon is one of them.

01:15:19.763 --> 01:15:22.731
And I hate guns.

01:15:23.801 --> 01:15:26.967
I love the trees
and I grew up here.

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:28.569
Why Oregon for you?

01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:32.273
Hmm, well in I grew
up in East Texas.

01:15:33.509 --> 01:15:37.777
Trees, lakes, a
place much like this.

01:15:37.779 --> 01:15:39.913
Hunting, fishing, and guns.

01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:42.982
After the incident in Dallas,

01:15:42.984 --> 01:15:44.217
I needed a change.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.486
Tad County needed a sheriff.

01:15:47.956 --> 01:15:50.389
You know, guns are a
requirement for sheriffs.

01:15:51.425 --> 01:15:53.158
Maybe I should take
you shooting some time.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.962
No, that's okay.

01:15:56.964 --> 01:16:00.065
Lunch and conversation
is just fine.

01:16:02.001 --> 01:16:04.367
Fair enough.

01:16:04.369 --> 01:16:06.736
Listen, what happened
in that house?

01:16:06.739 --> 01:16:09.941
I know you may not
wanna talk about it.

01:16:09.943 --> 01:16:10.842
I understand.

01:16:12.445 --> 01:16:15.212
No, it's okay.

01:16:15.214 --> 01:16:16.780
It was a long time ago

01:16:16.782 --> 01:16:20.016
but there was a family
that lived there.

01:16:20.018 --> 01:16:23.086
And the man, Jim Talent,

01:16:23.088 --> 01:16:26.155
he was disturbed.

01:16:26.157 --> 01:16:28.457
He was mentally
ill and back then,

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:31.327
people just thought
he was mean-spirited.

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:33.896
He lived there with his wife

01:16:33.898 --> 01:16:36.365
and they were having an argument

01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:37.899
and he shot her.

01:16:39.269 --> 01:16:41.703
A kid was passing by on
a bike and heard the shot

01:16:41.705 --> 01:16:43.371
and walked in on Jim.

01:16:46.176 --> 01:16:51.245
The wife was dead on the
couch, covered in blood,

01:16:52.348 --> 01:16:54.348
and Jim was holding
a pistol in his hand.

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.816
Jim was out of his mind,

01:16:55.818 --> 01:16:58.085
and he kept yelling at
the kid to shoot him.

01:16:59.555 --> 01:17:01.221
He put the gun in the kid's hand

01:17:01.223 --> 01:17:03.156
and he was saying, "Shoot me!"

01:17:04.259 --> 01:17:06.259
He kept saying,
"End it, end it!"

01:17:07.228 --> 01:17:08.361
"Shoot me!"

01:17:09.597 --> 01:17:12.064
The kid, the kid
didn't know what to do

01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:16.668
so she dropped the gun,

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:17.702
she ran out

01:17:17.704 --> 01:17:22.774
and she thought, "I should have,

01:17:23.577 --> 01:17:24.509
I should have taken the gun.

01:17:24.511 --> 01:17:26.010
I should have grabbed the gun

01:17:26.012 --> 01:17:28.879
and run out with it so he
couldn't hurt himself."

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:31.315
And then

01:17:35.021 --> 01:17:37.188
a gun shot.

01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:39.222
Jim shot himself.

01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:48.231
That's why you
don't like guns.

01:17:48.233 --> 01:17:50.866
Do you still ride bikes?

01:17:50.868 --> 01:17:52.901
That's why I don't like guns.

01:17:55.139 --> 01:17:57.472
I never told that
to anyone before.

01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:59.541
Thank you.

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:04.445
Did anyone ever tell you
you're easy to talk to?

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:06.447
Just criminals.

01:18:50.656 --> 01:18:51.788
Here, stay here.

01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:52.923
Stay here.

01:18:52.925 --> 01:18:53.757
What is it?

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.526
I am gonna go upstairs

01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:58.128
and find out what
is behind that door!

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:00.731
I'm gonna have to break
it down if I have to!

01:19:00.733 --> 01:19:03.132
No, maybe there's a reason

01:19:03.134 --> 01:19:05.234
we're not supposed
to be in there.

01:19:05.236 --> 01:19:08.137
An animal or a water
heater or something.

01:19:09.941 --> 01:19:13.541
Lee, don't you
wanna get in there?

01:19:13.543 --> 01:19:14.676
Don't you wanna see
what's in there?

01:19:14.678 --> 01:19:16.444
I have to go up there!

01:19:16.446 --> 01:19:17.646
I'm sorry.

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:27.376
Oh thank you!

01:20:27.378 --> 01:20:28.444
Oh, thank you for coming!

01:20:28.446 --> 01:20:29.445
Thank you for coming!

01:20:29.447 --> 01:20:31.347
My daughter, she's gone!

01:20:31.349 --> 01:20:32.548
I can't find her!

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:36.051
She's hurt and I
can't find my keys!

01:20:36.053 --> 01:20:39.187
My keys are gone and I
have to find my daughter!

01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:40.021
You have to help me!

01:20:40.023 --> 01:20:41.422
Now just calm down.

01:20:41.424 --> 01:20:43.725
I told you this bitch was crazy.

01:20:43.727 --> 01:20:44.692
What? No, no, no.

01:20:44.694 --> 01:20:46.027
No, no, no. You don't under-

01:20:46.029 --> 01:20:47.562
- Just stay the fuck there.

01:20:47.564 --> 01:20:48.429
We don't want any problems.

01:20:49.264 --> 01:20:50.530
What?

01:20:50.532 --> 01:20:54.101
No, no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

01:20:54.103 --> 01:20:56.436
I can't find my daughter.

01:20:56.438 --> 01:20:59.072
And she's really hurt.

01:20:59.074 --> 01:21:01.607
I, I don't have my keys.

01:21:01.609 --> 01:21:03.042
I have to get into town.

01:21:03.044 --> 01:21:04.677
You, can you go to town?

01:21:04.679 --> 01:21:06.412
- Sophie.
- You go to town.

01:21:06.414 --> 01:21:08.381
You know something,
what the hell is going on?

01:21:08.383 --> 01:21:10.683
Yeah, we heard these screams
a few nights ago here,

01:21:10.685 --> 01:21:12.852
and now we're hearing
them in this upstairs,

01:21:12.854 --> 01:21:14.052
the same place.

01:21:14.054 --> 01:21:16.388
Yeah, there's no
doubt you need help,

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:17.589
but you know what,
right now, you need

01:21:17.591 --> 01:21:19.391
just stay the fuck away from us!

01:21:19.393 --> 01:21:21.192
What?

01:21:21.194 --> 01:21:22.460
But...

01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:25.496
Okay, okay, okay,
something strange,

01:21:25.498 --> 01:21:27.197
something strange is going on.

01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:29.666
It's true, it's true, it's true.

01:21:29.668 --> 01:21:31.568
I don't know what it is.

01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:33.237
My daughter is gone!

01:21:33.239 --> 01:21:34.171
Gone!

01:21:34.173 --> 01:21:35.172
Gone! Do you understand?

01:21:35.174 --> 01:21:37.106
She's not here!

01:21:37.108 --> 01:21:39.175
And she needs help.

01:21:39.177 --> 01:21:40.376
You satisfied?

01:21:40.378 --> 01:21:42.011
Can we get the fuck
outta here now?

01:21:42.881 --> 01:21:44.480
Wait, don't...

01:21:45.884 --> 01:21:46.783
Lee!

01:22:27.321 --> 01:22:30.189
Why do you hate me, Mom?

01:22:30.191 --> 01:22:32.424
I don't hate you, baby.

01:22:32.426 --> 01:22:34.960
Why, why would you say that?

01:22:34.962 --> 01:22:37.094
You let Dale take me.

01:22:37.096 --> 01:22:38.830
You could have stopped him.

01:22:38.832 --> 01:22:41.265
Uh, I didn't want
you to go, baby.

01:22:41.267 --> 01:22:43.601
I did my best, I did my best!

01:22:43.603 --> 01:22:46.270
Okay, I found somebody new.

01:22:47.106 --> 01:22:48.673
You know Matt.

01:22:48.675 --> 01:22:49.573
Hi, Sophie.

01:22:52.411 --> 01:22:55.879
Don't worry, I'll
take care of her.

01:22:56.782 --> 01:22:57.848
I'll make her happy.

01:23:01.419 --> 01:23:03.786
Our little girl's skin,

01:23:03.788 --> 01:23:05.788
as smooth as butter.

01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:08.791
Why would
you do that, Mom?

01:23:08.793 --> 01:23:10.392
Why would you let Dale hurt me?

01:23:13.263 --> 01:23:14.662
Yeah, Mom.

01:23:14.664 --> 01:23:15.897
How could you?

01:23:17.267 --> 01:23:20.468
You touch her
and I swear to God!

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.439
Or what, Mom?

01:23:27.209 --> 01:23:29.009
I'll fucking kill you!

01:23:34.717 --> 01:23:36.250
Mom.

01:23:40.688 --> 01:23:43.523
I'll
fucking kill you.

01:23:45.627 --> 01:23:49.361
Ooh, Mama has some spirit.

01:23:52.299 --> 01:23:55.033
After I'm done
with your daughter,

01:23:56.069 --> 01:23:58.970
maybe I'll get a
slice of you as well.

01:24:03.476 --> 01:24:05.709
I will fucking kill you!

01:24:06.646 --> 01:24:07.645
Me first.

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:12.483
Did you
take your pills today?

01:24:12.485 --> 01:24:14.551
Yes, I took my fucking pills!

01:24:14.553 --> 01:24:17.954
Hang on you bitch,
just give me a second.

01:24:17.956 --> 01:24:19.622
Okay, but you have
to drink another one.

01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:22.625
Did anything happen when
I was away yesterday?

01:24:22.627 --> 01:24:24.827
But
you're were here, Mom.

01:24:24.829 --> 01:24:26.094
Oh my God.

01:24:26.931 --> 01:24:29.197
Now what are the chances.

01:24:29.199 --> 01:24:31.066
You
let Dale take me.

01:24:31.068 --> 01:24:32.834
You could have stopped him.

01:24:32.836 --> 01:24:35.938
I didn't want you to go, baby.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.905
I did my best, I did my best.

01:24:37.907 --> 01:24:41.208
Maybe we should,
maybe we should leave.

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:43.711
What do you think?

01:24:46.783 --> 01:24:47.682
Okay.

01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:50.951
Okay.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:53.653
All right.

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:01.827
Okay.

01:25:57.714 --> 01:25:59.581
What are you doing here?

01:26:02.418 --> 01:26:04.818
I just want you to
know he's not a bad guy.

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.887
You could have told me first.

01:26:06.889 --> 01:26:07.788
Fuck!

01:26:08.591 --> 01:26:09.857
Can I come in?

01:26:11.727 --> 01:26:12.825
Come in, Dale.

01:26:14.396 --> 01:26:15.628
Come on in.

01:27:13.183 --> 01:27:18.252
Lee, come on, let's go.

01:27:18.955 --> 01:27:19.954
- Why?
- Lee, come on.

01:27:19.956 --> 01:27:20.922
Let's go.

01:27:20.924 --> 01:27:22.623
- But why?
- Lee, come on.

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:23.658
Let's go.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:25.025
- Just stop.
- Lee!

01:27:25.027 --> 01:27:26.226
Come on, let's go!

01:27:26.228 --> 01:27:27.761
- No.
- Lee, come on!

01:27:27.763 --> 01:27:29.096
- Let's go!
- Dale!

01:28:59.281 --> 01:29:00.580
Rise, princess.

01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:05.217
Shh, that's a good girl.
