00:25.400 --> 00:27.268
This is a form for
declaring a major.

00:27.302 --> 00:29.603
I saw the form.
Why did you lie to me?

00:29.638 --> 00:32.305
Why didn't you tell me you're
nowhere close to picking a major?

00:32.340 --> 00:34.275
OK, I'm sorry. I screwed up.

00:34.309 --> 00:36.110
But the truth is,
I'm not ready to graduate.

00:47.556 --> 00:49.724
Um... hi.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.592
Will you accept my a-pollen-gy?

00:51.626 --> 00:52.893
"A-pollen-gy?"

00:52.928 --> 00:56.564
Well, ahem, it was
either that or, uh...

00:56.598 --> 00:58.699
"please flor-give me."

01:00.469 --> 01:03.304
I bought the flowers. I didn't steal
them from someone else's lawn.

01:03.338 --> 01:05.438
So what do you say?

01:05.474 --> 01:07.842
Come on, Case, we've barely
spoken since Mardi Gras

01:07.876 --> 01:09.510
and now I'm apologizing.

01:10.579 --> 01:12.279
Thank you for the flowers.

01:12.314 --> 01:14.949
And how about the a-pollen-gy?

01:14.983 --> 01:18.285
Do you really mean it? - Sure.
I'm sorry for our fight.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.588
The fight? That's it?

01:20.622 --> 01:23.257
And anything else I may have
done recently, hence the flowers.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.793
Can we just make up and pretend
like this never happened?

01:25.827 --> 01:27.661
When I thought I might have
had a chance in Washington

01:27.696 --> 01:30.331
you told me you wanted to
declare a major, which implied

01:30.365 --> 01:32.967
that you wanted to move forward
with us after graduation.

01:33.001 --> 01:34.635
But now that you don't,

01:34.669 --> 01:36.203
I'm a little freaked out about us.

01:36.238 --> 01:37.505
Um...

01:37.539 --> 01:39.573
I have to get to class.

01:40.575 --> 01:42.309
Cool! Yeah, no, I'll just...

01:42.344 --> 01:44.011
...bring the flowers
by later, then.

01:47.783 --> 01:50.184
Your hair, it looks...

01:50.218 --> 01:52.653
Like Madonna's Lucky Star video,
1983?

01:52.687 --> 01:54.388
Exactly!

01:54.422 --> 01:56.724
I'm just trying out some looks
for '80s Night at Dobler's.

01:56.758 --> 01:57.858
Are you going?

01:57.893 --> 01:59.527
'Cause you should really come

01:59.561 --> 02:01.929
and dress as Anthony Michael
Hall in Sixteen Candles.

02:01.963 --> 02:04.665
Or in The Breakfast Club.
Or Weird Science.

02:04.699 --> 02:06.801
I might, but I wouldn't
know who to take.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.937
You see, I'm kind of in this
complicated dating situation.

02:09.971 --> 02:12.473
You see, there's Katherine
and there's Dana.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.208
I'm sort of dating Katherine,

02:14.242 --> 02:17.278
but Dana told me she likes me, too.

02:17.312 --> 02:19.380
But if I'm gonna get into
another relationship,

02:19.414 --> 02:21.348
I want to make sure that
I have the right match.

02:21.383 --> 02:24.518
OK, so how serious
is it with Katherine?

02:25.554 --> 02:27.321
She asked me to take her virginity,

02:27.355 --> 02:29.690
but I turned her down.

02:29.724 --> 02:32.560
Rusty. - What? I left
her a bunch of messages,

02:32.594 --> 02:33.861
but I haven't heard from her yet.

02:33.895 --> 02:35.462
Uh, you're never
gonna hear from her

02:35.497 --> 02:38.833
'cause she is never going
to talk to you again.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.235
You ran out on her when she tried
to lose her virginity to you?

02:41.269 --> 02:45.005
It wasn't because of her.
The circumstances were completely wrong.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.974
Rusty, she's gonna think
you thought she was fat.

02:47.008 --> 02:50.744
- She's so not fat.
- It doesn't matter. She's a girl.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.614
She's mortified,
and you blew it. Case closed.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.691
Can anyone tell me what
movie that was from?

03:03.725 --> 03:06.527
- A-heezy?
- Can't Buy Me Love, 1987.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.964
Yes! Today we're looking
at marketing in the 1980s

03:09.998 --> 03:13.167
and how companies started
using movies to sell to teens.

03:13.201 --> 03:16.737
Teens were finally recognized for
their legitimate buying power.

03:16.771 --> 03:19.907
They also flocked to movies
that could be made on the cheap,

03:19.941 --> 03:24.011
and all it took to market them was
one great pop song on the soundtrack.

03:24.045 --> 03:26.180
Can anyone name one of these songs?

03:26.214 --> 03:28.382
Anyone? Anyone?

03:28.984 --> 03:29.984
Anyone?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.255
Bueller? Get it?

03:35.290 --> 03:37.157
OK. Ferris Bueller...

03:37.192 --> 03:40.527
Hey, so you're absolutely positive

03:40.562 --> 03:41.996
that I blew it with Katherine?

03:42.030 --> 03:45.065
Yeah. But doesn't that
solve your problem?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.534
You are free to date Dana.

03:47.569 --> 03:49.203
She is perfect for you anyway.

03:49.237 --> 03:50.537
Yeah, she's pretty great.

03:50.572 --> 03:53.607
So what if she thinks that
I slept with Katherine,

03:53.642 --> 03:55.876
and I haven't talked to her
since she told me she liked me?

03:55.911 --> 03:58.145
- I'm gonna go for Dana.
- Oh, Rusty.

03:59.147 --> 04:01.148
She thinks I think she's fat, too.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.484
Yeah, probably.

04:03.485 --> 04:13.415

04:15.297 --> 04:17.197
Hello.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.202
Are you OK?

04:22.237 --> 04:24.638
Yeah.

04:24.673 --> 04:27.408
So I haven't seen you in a few days.
How are you doing?

04:27.442 --> 04:29.310
You don't have to give
me that pitying look,

04:29.344 --> 04:31.578
like I'm some kindergartener
who came to school

04:31.613 --> 04:34.481
with a maxi pad around her knee
because she thought it was a bandage.

04:34.516 --> 04:37.985
And if that did happen,
it would be a totally honest mistake...

04:38.019 --> 04:40.154
- Your finger's stuck?
- No.

04:40.188 --> 04:41.889
Let me help.

04:44.859 --> 04:48.395
Nothing happened with Katherine
after the Mardi Gras party.

04:51.266 --> 04:53.200
- Really?
- No.

04:53.234 --> 04:55.736
Even though she's blonde and leggy

04:55.770 --> 04:57.905
with high cheekbones
and a sure thing?

04:57.939 --> 04:59.506
Yeah. That's right.

04:59.541 --> 05:03.844
Uh, what I'm trying
to say now is...

05:05.313 --> 05:07.481
Dana, will you go out
with me Saturday night?

05:08.450 --> 05:10.184
I'll have to think about it.

05:11.486 --> 05:12.920
I'm just kidding.

05:12.954 --> 05:15.322
- Of course I will.
- Great.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
I'm sorry, Case.

05:21.229 --> 05:24.298
I just don't get why someone
as smart and amazing as Cappie

05:24.332 --> 05:26.567
would want to stay
in college forever.

05:26.601 --> 05:29.103
I understand wanting to party
and screw around for a while.

05:29.137 --> 05:30.537
I've done plenty of that myself.

05:30.572 --> 05:34.174
But I can't hehelp but wonder
if maybe you weren't right, Ash.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.110
What if we are too different?

05:36.144 --> 05:40.180
And what if we're...
not going to last forever?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.683
No matter how much we try or
how much we love each other.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.119
I don't want to be
right about that,

05:45.153 --> 05:47.388
so you need to address
this with Cappie,

05:47.422 --> 05:50.391
head-on. - OK, well,
how do I address someone

05:50.425 --> 05:53.727
who says he might never
want to leave college?

05:53.762 --> 05:56.130
He can't possibly mean that.
That'd just be crazy, right?

05:56.164 --> 05:58.899
Would it? I mean, it's Cappie
we're talking about here,

05:58.933 --> 06:01.535
and he definitely has his
own way of doing things.

06:01.569 --> 06:05.406
And, didn't you kind of already know
that when you got back together?

06:05.440 --> 06:07.408
So why are you trying
to change him now?

06:07.442 --> 06:09.877
You're right. I know.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.414
I love Cappie, and I
don't want to change him.

06:13.448 --> 06:16.283
But if we're on
completely different paths

06:16.317 --> 06:18.886
and he stays here forever
we're never going to work,

06:18.920 --> 06:21.255
which scares the crap out of me.

06:21.289 --> 06:22.956
Then you need to make
him understand that.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.762
Cheap beer and The
Political Economy.

06:28.797 --> 06:31.365
Wow, Evan, this is sad.

06:31.399 --> 06:35.102
I am behind in my reading,
and I can't afford good beer.

06:35.136 --> 06:38.906
I guess the economy and I
are both a bit depressed.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.076
- About Rebecca?
- Mmm.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.411
How could I have been so stupid?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.181
You know, buying her that
necklace with money I didn't have?

06:47.215 --> 06:49.083
I put my position in
the house at risk,

06:49.117 --> 06:50.784
not to mention my
friendship with you.

06:52.153 --> 06:54.521
And she slept with someone else.

06:54.556 --> 06:57.424
You have any idea who it was with? - No.
I don't really care.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.127
OK, I care a little.

07:02.730 --> 07:07.434
God, why, when beer is called "something's
best", is it always the worst?

07:07.469 --> 07:10.671
Good question. Hey, Grant went
to Michigan to see Kylie Minogue,

07:10.705 --> 07:12.372
so I'm flying solo this weekend.

07:12.407 --> 07:15.542
How about we go to this,
uh, '80s party?

07:15.577 --> 07:18.479
Everybody Wang Chung
like a virgin! -

07:18.513 --> 07:21.315
Maybe if my jokes were better
she wouldn't have cheated.

07:22.550 --> 07:25.085
Look, don't beat yourself
up about it, all right?

07:25.120 --> 07:26.954
Everybody knows Rebecca
Logan's got issues.

07:28.723 --> 07:30.757
For what it's worth,
I got the impression

07:30.792 --> 07:32.593
that she really did like you.

07:32.627 --> 07:35.762
That's worth about as
much as a bottle of...

07:35.797 --> 07:37.197
...Sandusky's Best.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.305
Rusty!

07:46.808 --> 07:49.510
Hey, Katherine.
I don't think you're fat.

07:49.544 --> 07:51.178
Nor do I.

07:52.447 --> 07:55.349
Oh, well, good. But you're
mad at me, though, right?

07:55.383 --> 07:58.852
Well, I see my failure to return
all seven of your voice messages

07:58.887 --> 08:02.022
has not gone unnoticed.
Rusty, I'm not angry.

08:02.056 --> 08:04.024
- You're not?
- Initially, I was.

08:04.058 --> 08:05.692
It was very embarrassing.

08:05.727 --> 08:07.995
But I realized that you were completely
right to withdraw when you did.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.630
The timing was completely off,

08:09.664 --> 08:11.331
and for you to have the
restraint to realize that

08:11.366 --> 08:14.801
in such a passionate moment
really was the height of chivalry.

08:14.836 --> 08:18.071
I'm completely mortified
by my actions,

08:18.106 --> 08:21.808
and I'm hoping that
we can move past this.

08:23.611 --> 08:26.146
Of course we can.

08:26.181 --> 08:29.483
So I guess we got through
our first big fight. -

08:29.517 --> 08:32.152
You know what they say about relationships:
they all have speed bumps.

08:32.187 --> 08:34.888
Relationships? - Furthermore,
I think we should take it slow.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.823
- You know, no sex yet.
- No.

08:36.857 --> 08:38.958
So do you have plans
tomorrow night?

08:38.993 --> 08:40.827
- No.
- Great.

08:40.861 --> 08:43.897
We can go to the Dobler's
'80s party together.

08:43.932 --> 08:46.667
That's nice. I never have any
dates for these Greek events.

08:46.701 --> 08:49.503
Um, but I'm late for my
hierarchy and hegemony seminar,

08:49.537 --> 08:51.371
so we'll talk details later.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.839
I promise I'll call you back.

08:57.712 --> 09:00.380
I know how much you don't want to
talk about this, but we have to:

09:00.415 --> 09:02.716
graduation, our future, all of it.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.954
We have to figure it out.
I mean, I am graduating in May.

09:06.988 --> 09:09.590
And I might be leaving CRU.

09:09.624 --> 09:11.325
But you might get into CRU Law,

09:11.359 --> 09:13.927
- and then we don't have to worry about it.
- But what if I don't?

09:13.962 --> 09:15.596
- But what if you do?
- Cappie.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.798
OK, look, if you go somewhere else,

09:17.832 --> 09:19.933
then we'll just do long-distance.

09:19.968 --> 09:22.803
But for how long? For 20 years,
until you graduate?

09:22.837 --> 09:24.938
- How will that work?
- Graduation isn't even until May.

09:24.973 --> 09:26.340
Why can't we just
deal with it then?

09:26.374 --> 09:30.477
Because I'm not as good at
living in the now as you.

09:30.511 --> 09:33.413
I just... I can't feel comfortable in our
relationship not knowing where we're going.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.782
- You might be going to CRU Law.
- But what if I don't?

09:35.817 --> 09:37.684
- But what if you do?
- Oh, my God, Cappie!

09:37.719 --> 09:40.687
You... You have to accept you
can't be in college forever...

09:40.722 --> 09:42.623
Surprise!

09:42.657 --> 09:46.293
April? Tobias? What the hell
are you guys doing here?

09:46.327 --> 09:48.362
Whoa! Too early for
a philosophy quiz.

09:48.396 --> 09:50.464
It's great to see you!

09:50.498 --> 09:54.601
This must be Casey. She's gorgeous!

09:54.636 --> 09:58.438
- Hi.
- Amazing eyes.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.140
Who are you?

10:00.174 --> 10:02.843
- Oh!
- Oh! Uh, Casey, um...

10:04.512 --> 10:06.246
These are my parents.

10:08.182 --> 10:11.652
Wow! - So this is where
the magic happens, huh?

10:19.304 --> 10:22.039
- Hurry up, Beav!
- Don't rush me.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.876
- What color am I again?
- Red.

10:25.911 --> 10:27.745
Damn it!

10:27.779 --> 10:29.714
So, guys, I have a little problem.

10:29.748 --> 10:33.351
I seem to have found
myself dating two girls.

10:34.753 --> 10:36.120
At the same time.

10:38.123 --> 10:40.624
And that's not enough?

10:40.659 --> 10:43.494
You want a different girl for every
night of the week? Way to be greedy.

10:43.528 --> 10:46.497
No. I think two girls
is one too many.

10:46.531 --> 10:48.032
I think one girl's one too many.

10:48.066 --> 10:49.867
I really need to figure this out.

10:49.901 --> 10:52.503
Two girls liking me? Yeah,
never happened before.

10:52.537 --> 10:54.338
It's like a syzygy or something.

10:54.373 --> 10:56.407
- Yeah, it is!
- No.

10:56.441 --> 10:59.643
A syzygy is the alignment of
three or more celestial bodies

10:59.678 --> 11:02.246
along a straight line.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.748
Never mind.

11:03.782 --> 11:05.983
So, I need to figure out
which one is better for me

11:06.018 --> 11:08.919
- and then go out with her.
- That sounds confusing.

11:08.954 --> 11:12.123
- I say you just date them both.
- Never mind. Is Cappie here?

11:12.157 --> 11:13.657
Uh, Spitter.

11:13.692 --> 11:15.960
There's nothing wrong
with dating two chicks.

11:15.994 --> 11:19.063
You just need to make sure they
both know things are casual.

11:19.097 --> 11:21.432
Keep saying the word "casual,"

11:21.466 --> 11:23.367
and make sure one never
finds out about the other.

11:23.402 --> 11:25.369
- Lying helps.
- Beaver has a point.

11:25.404 --> 11:27.738
And how are you ever gonna figure
out which one you like more

11:27.773 --> 11:30.474
- without dating both of 'em?
- That's true.

11:30.509 --> 11:32.143
You really think I
can pull that off?

11:32.177 --> 11:34.745
- Casual.
- Thanks, guys.

11:34.780 --> 11:38.082
Oh, Beav, I think Pledge
Snuggie is your next move.

11:38.116 --> 11:40.351
Pledge Snuggie,

11:40.385 --> 11:42.353
leapfrog Pledge Slanket
and get kinged.

11:43.722 --> 11:46.457
- Ohh!
- Great effort, pledge.

11:48.494 --> 11:50.361
Let's get out of here.
I don't want to run into Rebecca.

11:50.396 --> 11:52.830
Oh, no, she's not here.
She went to visit her mom.

11:52.865 --> 11:54.699
- She did?
- Yeah.

11:54.733 --> 11:57.101
So we don't have to study at the union.
We can just stay here.

11:57.136 --> 11:59.837
I only have an hour 'cause I'm meeting
Cappie and his parents for lunch.

11:59.872 --> 12:01.172
Cappie's parents?

12:01.206 --> 12:04.108
Yeah. They dropped in
for a surprise visit.

12:04.143 --> 12:05.877
Sounds like April and Tobias.

12:05.911 --> 12:07.779
You know, they're pretty
much the stereotype

12:07.813 --> 12:09.814
of the flaky hippies
who never grew up?

12:09.848 --> 12:11.182
Don't be such a snob, Evan.

12:11.216 --> 12:13.918
They seem really nice,
and Cappie adores them.

12:13.952 --> 12:15.586
It explains a lot
about Cappie, huh?

12:17.156 --> 12:19.390
I'm sorry. It's weird
for you to talk to me

12:19.425 --> 12:21.292
about my relationship problems.

12:21.326 --> 12:24.862
Oh, are you and Cappie
having relationship problems?

12:24.897 --> 12:27.799
Never mind. You can't be
objective about Cappie.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.467
There's too much baggage
between you two.

12:29.501 --> 12:31.903
Fair enough, but I can
be objective about you.

12:31.937 --> 12:34.072
Listen, you're never
gonna be the aimless

12:34.106 --> 12:36.207
and groundless kind of
people that they are.

12:36.241 --> 12:39.410
And it is, it's fun at first,
but it's not real, you know.

12:39.445 --> 12:42.380
And with them here, you're
gonna get to see that firsthand

12:42.414 --> 12:45.083
because I am pretty sure
they are still exactly

12:45.117 --> 12:49.020
the same irresponsible people
they were back at camp.

12:50.389 --> 12:51.889
Good day to you, Casey.

12:51.924 --> 12:54.425
- Deep-fried Divinity Square?
- Yeah. Um, thanks.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.594
Got the recipe from my
church potluck last week.

12:56.628 --> 12:58.429
- Evan, you want one?
- Yeah, I'll take...

12:58.464 --> 13:00.732
Wait, wait. Evan Chambers?

13:00.766 --> 13:04.435
Yeah. - Evan Chambers, the violent
predator of Rusty Cartwright?

13:04.470 --> 13:06.771
The betrayer of Cappie?

13:06.805 --> 13:09.040
You'll get one of
my deep-fried snacks

13:09.074 --> 13:12.110
when you pry it out of my cold,
dead hands.

13:13.312 --> 13:15.980
This... This week sucks.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.088
And does every ZBZ know about
Rebecca cheating on me?

13:24.123 --> 13:26.924
Yeah. It really sucks to
get cheated on, doesn't it?

13:26.959 --> 13:29.660
You're right.
I'm... I'm sorry, Case.

13:30.496 --> 13:32.363
I probably deserve it.

13:32.397 --> 13:35.199
You know, truth is, though,
Rebecca was always upfront with me

13:35.234 --> 13:37.468
about what she wanted,
and I was the one

13:37.503 --> 13:40.104
that tried to force the relationship
into something it wasn't.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.007
Right.

13:43.041 --> 13:45.843
- These maple bars are good.
- I knew you'd like them.

13:45.878 --> 13:47.678
I just love the smell
of maple, don't you?

13:47.713 --> 13:49.947
Second only to the smell
of blue permanent marker.

13:49.982 --> 13:53.284
I, uh, saw Katherine earlier.
You did?

13:53.318 --> 13:55.353
What did you say? What did she say?

13:55.387 --> 13:57.622
I didn't talk to her. Duh!

13:57.656 --> 13:59.757
You know, I just sort
of feel bad for her.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.559
I mean, are you guys
friends now or...

14:01.593 --> 14:03.494
- No!
- No? Why not?

14:03.529 --> 14:06.164
Um... because when I told her

14:06.198 --> 14:08.733
that you and I were
casually dating,

14:08.767 --> 14:11.702
she was really mad.
She yelled a lot.

14:11.737 --> 14:14.906
She told me to go suck on a lot of
different things. It was brutal.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.308
Jeez. Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Rusty.

14:17.342 --> 14:19.243
But you know what?
You did the right thing,

14:19.278 --> 14:21.345
and I'm sure she'll come
to appreciate your honesty

14:21.380 --> 14:24.215
and the fact that you didn't,
you know, just string her along

14:24.249 --> 14:26.851
only to dump her later.
You know, like some big fat jerk.

14:26.885 --> 14:30.188
Oh, right. Like a big fat jerk.

14:34.927 --> 14:36.894
- Oh, hey.
- Case.

14:36.929 --> 14:39.030
Hey, we turned pledge
checkers into pledge chess.

14:39.064 --> 14:40.932
We haven't figured
out how to play yet.

14:40.966 --> 14:42.900
Chess is hard.

14:44.203 --> 14:48.372
I know it's not exactly a
future-oriented activity...

14:48.407 --> 14:50.975
I get it. I know.
I sound like a broken record.

14:51.009 --> 14:53.911
So why don't we just wait to talk about
this until after your parents leave, OK?

14:53.946 --> 14:55.680
- Sounds great.
- Here they are, honey.

14:55.714 --> 14:57.548
Oh, hey there, Mr. and Ms...

14:57.583 --> 15:00.017
Please. April and Tobias.
Sorry we're early.

15:00.052 --> 15:02.253
I always lose track of
the time when I'm baked.

15:02.287 --> 15:04.622
- Tobias.
- I'm kidding.

15:04.656 --> 15:08.092
I love doing that. People get so
freaked out by hippie parents.

15:08.126 --> 15:10.761
Cappie, we just stopped for gas,

15:10.796 --> 15:12.763
and the attendant was
such an interesting guy.

15:12.798 --> 15:15.099
When I told him I was
visiting my son and his lover,

15:15.133 --> 15:18.970
he told me about this fantastic
campground just a few hours from here.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.438
Apparently it's hidden away,

15:20.472 --> 15:22.373
so no fanny pack-wearing tourists

15:22.407 --> 15:24.308
attracting bears
with their Twinkies.

15:24.343 --> 15:26.577
So what do you say?

15:26.612 --> 15:28.980
We skip lunch and go camping.
It'll be like old times.

15:29.014 --> 15:32.617
I brought my pan-flute. - I can make
my bulghar burgers and my soy-mores.

15:32.651 --> 15:34.085
Ooh.

15:34.119 --> 15:38.122
Um, I don't really have
any equipment or...

15:38.156 --> 15:40.992
It's OK. Guys, why don't we
just stick to lunch today?

15:41.026 --> 15:43.628
Beaver! My brother
from another mother.

15:43.662 --> 15:45.196
This guy!

15:46.665 --> 15:48.065
It's your move, Cap.

15:49.768 --> 15:52.103
Casey, I hope you don't think
we were being too pushy

15:52.137 --> 15:53.638
with this whole camping idea.

15:53.672 --> 15:55.773
We just thought it would
be the perfect setting

15:55.807 --> 15:58.442
for us to have a serious
conversation with Cappie.

15:58.477 --> 16:00.645
About what?

16:00.679 --> 16:03.314
Future stuff. We just have
some things we need to discuss.

16:03.348 --> 16:05.516
The future? Really?

16:05.550 --> 16:07.418
Um, you know what?

16:07.452 --> 16:09.553
I am sure that I can
rustle up a sleeping bag

16:09.588 --> 16:11.289
somewhere in the ZBZ house.

16:11.323 --> 16:12.823
- Really?
- Let's go camping.

16:12.858 --> 16:14.358
Oh!

16:20.426 --> 16:21.793
- Hey!
- Hey, Ash.

16:21.827 --> 16:24.596
Um, OK, which of these
do you like better?

16:24.630 --> 16:26.064
I'm sold on the jellies,

16:26.098 --> 16:28.166
but then I watched Can't Buy
Me Love last night,

16:28.200 --> 16:31.436
and I was reminded of the
charm of ankle boots.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.605
I was so born in the wrong decade.

16:33.639 --> 16:37.242
I have no idea. I need to talk to
you about my dating situation again.

16:37.276 --> 16:39.244
Oh. Well, perfect timing.

16:39.278 --> 16:40.845
I spent all last night
watching movies,

16:40.880 --> 16:42.981
pretty much the complete
works of Molly Ringwald,

16:43.015 --> 16:46.384
and then Just One of the Guys and
Girls Just Want to Have Fun.

16:46.419 --> 16:49.254
So I have watched many
complicated dating sfenarios.

16:49.288 --> 16:50.855
I am now an expert.

16:50.890 --> 16:52.924
OK, then. Here's one:

16:52.958 --> 16:56.361
Do you think it's possible for
a guy to date two girls at once

16:56.395 --> 16:58.530
without lying and being a jerk?

16:58.564 --> 17:00.699
Um, I think you know how I
feel about that subject.

17:00.733 --> 17:02.500
I know, and I don't
want to be like Fisher,

17:02.535 --> 17:07.972
but it turns out Katherine
and Dana both still like me.

17:08.007 --> 17:09.773
And Beaver says I
should date them both.

17:09.809 --> 17:11.843
- You asked Beaver?
- Cappie wasn't there.

17:11.877 --> 17:15.313
How else will I know which one is the
right choice without dating them both?

17:15.348 --> 17:19.117
Why can't life be easy,
like it is in those movies you watched?

17:19.151 --> 17:21.586
Hey, '80s rom-com
dating is never easy.

17:21.619 --> 17:23.454
You might have to give
your underwear to a nerd,

17:23.489 --> 17:25.656
you might have to
dress up like a guy

17:25.691 --> 17:27.392
and then fall for your best guy
friend who thinks that you're a guy.

17:27.425 --> 17:29.961
And this was all before people
were allowed to be gay in movies.

17:29.995 --> 17:32.297
And then, on top of it all,
your parents forget your birthday.

17:32.331 --> 17:34.833
- Does that sound easy?
- No. So, what do I do?

17:34.867 --> 17:36.201
I don't want to screw this up.

17:36.235 --> 17:39.537
Rusty, your situation is easy.

17:39.572 --> 17:42.207
Dana is the girl for you.

17:42.241 --> 17:45.210
Katherine isn't the underdog
girl who dates the science nerd.

17:45.244 --> 17:47.879
She's the imperious blonde
who dates James Spader,

17:47.913 --> 17:49.247
the preppy jackass.

17:49.281 --> 17:50.949
You're right.

17:50.983 --> 17:52.984
I should stick with Dana.

17:53.018 --> 17:55.120
It just feels right,when I'm wi.

17:55.154 --> 17:57.288
- That's important, isn't it?
- Of course.

17:58.724 --> 18:01.292
So you know what you
have to do now, right?

18:01.327 --> 18:03.395
You have to tell
Katherine the truth.

18:03.429 --> 18:05.063
I know.

18:11.937 --> 18:13.705
It seems mosquitoes can't resist

18:13.739 --> 18:15.874
my citrus vanilla body splash.

18:15.908 --> 18:19.277
Oh, you're getting eaten alive. Thanks for
being such a good sport about this.

18:19.311 --> 18:22.013
You sure you don't mind missing the
'80s party? - Not at all, not at all.

18:22.047 --> 18:25.216
I mean, really,
the '80s were a dark time.

18:25.251 --> 18:28.653
Trickle-down economics, The Super Bowl
Shuffle earning a Grammy nomination.

18:28.687 --> 18:30.088
Although I gotta say
I was looking forward

18:30.122 --> 18:33.992
to seeing you in that Madonna
pointy cones... thingamajig.

18:34.026 --> 18:36.761
Well, who says I didn't
bring it with me?

18:36.796 --> 18:40.965
A joke? A promise of sex?
Things are getting back to normal.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.934
What say we get
lost for a few hours

18:42.968 --> 18:44.436
while looking for some firewood?

18:44.470 --> 18:46.838
And miss more stories
about little Cappie?

18:46.872 --> 18:50.241
Not a chance. - Yes,
I'm very grateful my girlfriend knows

18:50.276 --> 18:52.510
that I wore hemp diapers
until I was five.

18:52.545 --> 18:55.513
We didn't want to rush you, hon, no matter
what that kindergarten teacher said.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.182
That's why we started
homeschooling.

18:57.216 --> 19:01.753
We moved around so much anyway:
Montana, Nova Scotia.

19:01.787 --> 19:03.321
Then we got that job
with the theater company,

19:03.355 --> 19:05.523
so we were all over New England.

19:05.558 --> 19:07.392
Lived in a few ashrams.

19:07.426 --> 19:08.726
Mmm!

19:08.761 --> 19:11.529
Oh, look, this is his
first grade picture.

19:11.564 --> 19:14.866
Wow! Uh, my first grade picture

19:14.900 --> 19:17.535
was of a bunch of little girls
with Hello Kitty barrettes

19:17.570 --> 19:19.604
and Disney princess dresses.

19:19.638 --> 19:22.073
Well, this was taken in Vermont.

19:22.107 --> 19:25.210
Then it was Panama,
and then Seattle.

19:25.244 --> 19:28.379
A riverboat along the Mississippi Delta.
I felt like Huck Finn.

19:28.414 --> 19:30.014
I can't even imagine.

19:30.049 --> 19:32.016
We moved down the street
when I was in sixth grade

19:32.051 --> 19:33.952
and I... I cried for a year.

19:33.986 --> 19:37.355
Well, you can get used
to anything, so I did.

19:37.389 --> 19:41.960
Well, um, that was a great
blast from the past.

19:41.994 --> 19:45.296
But, April, didn't you have something
else you wanted to talk about?

19:45.331 --> 19:47.131
Besides the past?

19:50.035 --> 19:52.470
Well, not just yet.
How about some music?

19:52.505 --> 19:55.340
- Oh!
- Look. Here she is.

19:55.374 --> 19:58.409
Oh, wow.

20:05.484 --> 20:08.386
Oh, man. Is that Eddie Murphy's
outfit from Raw?

20:08.420 --> 20:11.923
Jealous? What are you wearing?

20:11.957 --> 20:14.526
- Uh, I'll just take my socks off.
- That's weak.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.530
I... I don't know. Maybe I'm just not
jaunty enough for the '80s today.

20:18.564 --> 20:21.266
I just keep thinking about
how I'm just the schmuck

20:21.300 --> 20:23.134
who gave away that necklace,

20:23.168 --> 20:25.537
which is now sitting
somewhere in Rebecca's room

20:25.571 --> 20:26.838
just taunting me.

20:26.872 --> 20:28.973
All right, look,
I just can't take it anymore.

20:29.008 --> 20:31.442
We need to go retrieve
your manly dignity.

20:31.477 --> 20:33.211
Rebecca's over you,
so now it's time you got over her.

20:33.245 --> 20:36.180
- Yeah? Like how?
- Like we get that necklace back.

20:36.215 --> 20:38.283
Cal, I'm not... I can't
do that, all right?

20:38.317 --> 20:39.684
I'm taking the high road here.

20:42.221 --> 20:45.456
But, I mean, if we were going to go
get it back, how would that work?

20:45.491 --> 20:48.426
We can't just walk up the
stairs at ZBZ, you know?

20:48.460 --> 20:51.296
No, no. See, I think I may
have someone on the inside

20:51.330 --> 20:54.165
to get us into that boy-free zone.

20:54.199 --> 20:55.900
- You in?
- I'm in!

20:56.669 --> 20:57.936
All right.

20:57.970 --> 21:01.472
Schooled in manly dignity
by a guy in purple leather.

21:03.142 --> 21:05.143
You know, it's going
to get dark soon.

21:05.177 --> 21:06.644
Should we set up the other tent?

21:06.679 --> 21:08.980
What other tent?

21:09.014 --> 21:10.815
Looks like there's just one tent.

21:10.849 --> 21:12.283
Awesome, awesome.

21:12.318 --> 21:14.319
All that body heat
will keep us warm.

21:14.353 --> 21:16.688
Don't worry, we'll give
you two some private time.

21:16.722 --> 21:18.556
Thanks.

21:18.591 --> 21:21.426
Mmm! Dinner is amazing, Mr...

21:21.460 --> 21:24.796
- Sorry. Tobias.
- Thank you.

21:24.830 --> 21:26.230
Some more soy-mores?

21:26.265 --> 21:28.099
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.802
Mmm. - Took me years
to perfect those,

21:30.836 --> 21:32.704
but the bulghar burgers
are all Cappie.

21:32.738 --> 21:34.872
He came up with the
recipe one summer

21:34.907 --> 21:37.442
when we spent the entire year
at a converted wheat silo.

21:37.476 --> 21:39.677
I was inspired by my surroundings.

21:39.712 --> 21:42.080
He even got $1,
000 in scholarship money

21:42.114 --> 21:44.716
from the Wheat Growers
Society of America.

21:44.750 --> 21:48.720
Really? - You can get a whole
bunch of crazy-ass scholarships.

21:48.754 --> 21:52.323
I mean, I got one for spelling,
one for being ambidextrous,

21:52.358 --> 21:56.194
one for shaving "Stu's Steak Shack"
on the back of my head for two months.

21:56.228 --> 21:59.731
As vegetarians, we weren't too happy
about that one, but we let it go.

21:59.765 --> 22:01.799
He's such a smart kid.

22:01.834 --> 22:04.268
You know, he has almost
a free ride to CRU.

22:04.303 --> 22:06.270
Oh, oh! He is really smart.

22:06.305 --> 22:09.607
I mean, he has taken so many
different types of classes.

22:09.642 --> 22:12.543
Knowing Cappie, he probably has
enough credits to graduate already.

22:12.578 --> 22:15.380
- Is that so?
- Cappie, why the rush?

22:15.414 --> 22:18.016
Sounds like you're kind of
overextending yourself here.

22:18.050 --> 22:22.754
Stay at CRU until you're really ready
to leave, no matter how long that takes.

22:22.788 --> 22:26.758
Don't feel pressured by some
bourgeois four-year construct.

22:26.792 --> 22:29.861
Learning can be a lifelong
process. - Mm-hmm.

22:29.895 --> 22:31.696
- "Lifelong?"
- Yeah.

22:31.730 --> 22:34.298
Mom, Dad, Casey,

22:34.333 --> 22:37.435
I assure you I have no
intentions of rushing myself.

22:37.469 --> 22:40.204
But, I mean,
how is that even feasible?

22:40.239 --> 22:43.074
Your scholarship money is
going to run out sometime.

22:43.108 --> 22:46.310
We have an inheritance from my
father's free-range ostrich farm.

22:46.345 --> 22:48.246
He can stay as long as he likes.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.948
But why would you want him
to stay at a college forever?

22:50.983 --> 22:52.950
I mean, that's crazy.

22:52.985 --> 22:54.686
We believe that life is about doing

22:54.720 --> 22:56.688
what you as a person need to do,

22:56.722 --> 22:58.589
not what society tells you tw do.

22:58.624 --> 23:00.892
I thought you were gonna
back off about this.

23:00.926 --> 23:03.494
OK, well, I can't. So, excuse me.

23:15.374 --> 23:16.974
- Hi, Katherine.
- Hey, Rusty.

23:17.009 --> 23:18.810
We need to talk about our date.

23:18.844 --> 23:21.279
Oh, OK. Is it a matter
of dress formality

23:21.313 --> 23:23.715
or estimated time of arrival?
Because I'm very prompt.

23:23.749 --> 23:26.417
No. I can't go out with you.

23:26.452 --> 23:28.286
I'm sorry.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.221
But I'm dating Dana.

23:31.790 --> 23:33.558
Is it because I'm weird?

23:33.592 --> 23:35.393
No. Dana's weird, too.

23:35.427 --> 23:37.662
OK. Is it because I'm a whore?

23:39.064 --> 23:40.598
Because I threw
myself at you, or...?

23:40.632 --> 23:43.334
Oh, you're not a whore, and no.

23:43.368 --> 23:46.671
Well, I can't say that I'm not...

23:46.705 --> 23:48.539
...disappointed here, Rusty.

23:48.574 --> 23:50.575
I thought I had truly
found my match.

23:53.345 --> 23:55.747
Yeah, I know. I know
how important that is.

23:55.781 --> 23:57.415
You know, I know I
came on too strong,

23:57.449 --> 24:00.418
but I was so excited about finding
a fellow amalgam like you,

24:00.452 --> 24:03.221
you know, a Greek
who's also a geek.

24:04.823 --> 24:06.758
I thought...

24:06.792 --> 24:10.661
...that we had a unique
understanding of each other.

24:10.696 --> 24:12.830
I know. We do.

24:12.865 --> 24:14.198
And I thought, you know,
how perfect,

24:14.233 --> 24:17.602
someone who would really understand

24:17.636 --> 24:19.771
if I got caught up at a
four-hour chapter meeting,

24:19.805 --> 24:23.241
and who would totally
not make fun of me...

24:23.275 --> 24:28.579
...when I get so excited
about just cracking open

24:28.614 --> 24:30.348
a brand-new textbook.

24:30.382 --> 24:32.216
I would understand all that.

24:32.251 --> 24:33.851
It does make sense.

24:33.886 --> 24:35.853
I'm sorry it didn't
work out, Rusty.

24:35.888 --> 24:37.989
Then I guess I'll be
going to Dobler's solo.

24:38.023 --> 24:39.857
OK, wait, I might be rethinking...

24:39.892 --> 24:41.259
Goodbye, Rusty.

24:43.362 --> 24:44.695
Crap.

24:47.399 --> 24:49.133
What the hell was all that about?

24:49.168 --> 24:52.570
I thought we agreed on putting a
pin on the future stuff for now.

24:52.604 --> 24:54.572
Yeah, that's because I thought your
mother was going to talk to you

24:54.606 --> 24:56.240
about the future like
a rational person

24:56.275 --> 24:58.709
instead of condoning this idea you
should stay in college forever.

24:58.744 --> 25:01.045
I don't see why it's
such a big deal,

25:01.079 --> 25:03.714
especially since you might
get into CRU law school.

25:03.749 --> 25:05.416
- But what if I don't?
- But what if I do?

25:05.450 --> 25:07.151
Cappie, please!

25:07.186 --> 25:08.586
We can't do this again.

25:11.557 --> 25:15.092
Is your mom playing Physical
on the pan-flute?

25:15.127 --> 25:17.528
Does she think we're
going to do it in here?

25:17.563 --> 25:20.998
Probably, yeah.

25:21.033 --> 25:23.167
Oh, my God.

25:32.377 --> 25:33.678
I love you.

25:33.712 --> 25:36.180
And I want to be with you.

25:36.215 --> 25:38.583
But I don't know
how that can happen

25:38.617 --> 25:40.384
if you never want to graduate.

25:40.419 --> 25:43.454
And beyond that, I see so
much more out there for you.

25:43.488 --> 25:48.593
You have the potential to do something
extraordinary with your life.

25:48.627 --> 25:50.394
So here we are again.

25:50.429 --> 25:52.563
You want me to change
and I don't want to.

25:57.870 --> 25:59.637
You don't, do you?

26:02.941 --> 26:04.942
You're going to be
like your parents.

26:04.977 --> 26:08.279
That's what you want? - Maybe,
and what's wrong with that?

26:08.313 --> 26:09.814
And what's wrong with growing up?

26:12.117 --> 26:14.752
* Let me hear your body talk,
your body talk *

26:14.786 --> 26:17.154
* Let me hear your body talk *

26:17.189 --> 26:20.625
* Let's get physical, physical *

26:26.010 --> 26:27.945
Oh, back up. Evan
Chambers is your friend

26:27.979 --> 26:31.148
I'm supposed to help infiltrate ZBZ?
No way, no how.

26:31.982 --> 26:34.117
Get out of here! I'm not
afraid to use this spatula.

26:34.152 --> 26:36.920
Come on, Dale. - Yeah.
How about some Christian charity?

26:36.954 --> 26:39.723
Don't use my faith as a
cheap ploy, Chambers.

26:39.757 --> 26:42.859
And I'm not one of those wussy,
loving Christians, OK?

26:42.894 --> 26:46.263
I believe in a scary God who brings
hellfire to sinners like yourself.

26:46.297 --> 26:48.865
Wow! Well, this is pointless,
so I'm just gonna go.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.334
Rebecca can keep the stupid necklace.
I don't even care.

26:51.369 --> 26:53.603
- Wait, Rebecca Logan?
- Yeah.

26:53.638 --> 26:55.672
Why didn't you say so?
I'd aid and abet Satan himself

26:55.706 --> 26:57.841
to bring down that icy temptress.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.342
Welcome to ZBZ.

27:00.678 --> 27:02.312
- Cool.
- OK.

27:02.346 --> 27:04.448
Um, so what's the plan?

27:04.482 --> 27:06.116
'Cause we gotta sneak
past the girls,

27:06.150 --> 27:07.984
so maybe we need some
kind of distraction.

27:08.019 --> 27:09.386
I got that covered.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.355
Hey, ladies! Snickerdoodles
in the kitchen!

27:15.626 --> 27:19.663
Low-carb snickerdoodles!

27:19.697 --> 27:21.998
Don't justtand there admiring me.
You've got maybe five minutes

27:22.033 --> 27:24.000
to sneak through the front door and
get upstairs before they realize

27:24.035 --> 27:26.369
these are made with
high-fructose corn syrup. Go!

27:38.483 --> 27:41.218
Wow. Who knew Rebecca
was such a minimalist?

27:41.252 --> 27:43.553
Yeah, well, you know,
when you have no soul

27:43.588 --> 27:46.256
you don't crave the comfort
of sentimental knick-knacks.

27:48.893 --> 27:50.360
You can't even tell
they're low-carb.

27:50.394 --> 27:52.362
Dale should go on Top Chef.

27:57.902 --> 28:01.505
A-ha! - Fat-free
potato chips, girls!

28:01.539 --> 28:04.975
OK, let's go. - Guess what?
They have a laxative effect.

28:09.914 --> 28:11.915
She kept this from our first date.

28:14.852 --> 28:17.187
- Why would she do that?
- Yeah, uh, I don't know.

28:17.221 --> 28:18.555
Let's get the hell outta here.

28:25.463 --> 28:27.564
These snickerdoodles taste carb-y.

28:29.734 --> 28:31.735
- Are they?
- No.

28:31.769 --> 28:34.504
Don't you lie to me, Dale.
This is my fifth one.

28:34.539 --> 28:37.207
Would a loving Christian lie?

28:39.177 --> 28:42.612
Dale, the girls left the
dining room table a disaster.

28:42.647 --> 28:47.017
- How impolite of them.
- Well, what are you waiting for?

28:47.051 --> 28:50.086
The table's not going
to clean itself.

28:50.121 --> 28:51.621
No, it's not.

28:57.562 --> 28:59.529
- Nah.
- OK, I think I screwed up.

28:59.564 --> 29:02.732
I dumped Katherine,
but now I think I shouldn't have.

29:02.767 --> 29:05.302
Because breaking up with her was
like breaking up with myself.

29:05.336 --> 29:09.506
The Greek-geek amalgam. I've never met
one before. What if I never do again?

29:09.540 --> 29:11.942
What if this is my only chance at
finding my perfect counterpart?

29:11.976 --> 29:14.644
- Wait, what about Dana?
- I know.

29:14.679 --> 29:18.114
If you really think about it, though,
isn't Katherine a better match?

29:18.149 --> 29:20.116
Hold up.

29:20.151 --> 29:22.052
Maybe I've got this all wrong.

29:22.086 --> 29:24.254
Maybe Katherine isn't
the imperious blonde.

29:24.288 --> 29:27.490
She just looks like one.
She is an underdog, too.

29:27.525 --> 29:28.792
It's like in The Breakfast Club

29:28.826 --> 29:31.127
where you find out Molly
Ringwald has low self-esteem

29:31.162 --> 29:32.829
even though she's popular and hot.

29:32.863 --> 29:35.365
Well, I don't think
any of that matters

29:35.399 --> 29:37.834
because she's never gonna talk to
me again after what I just did.

29:37.868 --> 29:39.736
Eh, not so fast.

29:39.770 --> 29:43.406
The romantic comedy isn't
over until the credits roll.

29:43.441 --> 29:46.476
And even then, sometimes there's
a funny part after the credits.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.745
OK, Rusty...

29:48.779 --> 29:50.280
...we have to find her,

29:50.314 --> 29:52.015
no matter how impossible it seems.

29:52.049 --> 29:53.416
Even if she's about to get married

29:53.451 --> 29:55.151
or leaving for a semester at sea,

29:55.186 --> 29:57.520
or accidentally launching
herself into space.

29:57.555 --> 30:00.523
I think she's just at the
'80s party at Dobler's.

30:00.558 --> 30:02.993
Oh. Or that.

30:03.027 --> 30:04.127
Yeah. Let's go!

30:05.496 --> 30:06.763
Casey, wait up!

30:06.797 --> 30:09.165
Oh, are you going to the bathroom?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.500
There's a bathroom?

30:10.534 --> 30:13.236
Sure, you just duck behind a
tree and wipe with a leaf.

30:13.271 --> 30:15.972
Oh. Yeah, I don't...
I don't really have to go.

30:16.007 --> 30:20.043
Um, I just wanted to be by
myself for a little while.

30:20.077 --> 30:22.312
Well, actually I
wanted to talk to you.

30:22.346 --> 30:24.381
Is everything OK
with you and Cappie?

30:25.783 --> 30:28.451
- We had a fight.
- Oh.

30:28.486 --> 30:31.021
Anything that can't be resolved?

30:34.325 --> 30:36.459
For what it's worth,
I know it meant a lot to him

30:36.494 --> 30:38.361
for you to come out here tonight.

30:38.396 --> 30:42.232
You're the most important
person in his life.

30:42.266 --> 30:43.967
Thank you.

30:45.069 --> 30:46.803
We moved around so much,

30:46.837 --> 30:50.140
he had trouble bonding
with anyone other than us.

30:50.174 --> 30:53.209
Sometimes I worry that it
wasn't the st thing for him.

30:53.244 --> 30:56.646
The place he's lived longest
is the Kappa Tau house.

30:56.681 --> 31:00.050
Well, Cappie's turned out
to be such a great guy.

31:00.084 --> 31:02.152
I'm sure you had a
lot to do with that.

31:02.186 --> 31:03.887
Thanks.

31:04.789 --> 31:06.256
But you're the one now.

31:06.290 --> 31:10.193
You're his new family.
You, and those boys.

31:13.030 --> 31:16.633
You have been a good sport.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.402
I know there's a lot of other
things you'd rather be doing

31:19.437 --> 31:22.272
than spooning with a
couple of aging hippies.

31:22.306 --> 31:24.574
I could see that this is
really not your thing.

31:24.608 --> 31:27.711
Well, I mean, that's kind of what
Cappie and I were fighting about.

31:27.745 --> 31:31.348
It seems like his thing and
my thing are different,

31:31.382 --> 31:35.485
and we haven't quite figured
out how to make that work.

31:35.519 --> 31:38.421
Honey, he loves you
for who you are.

31:38.456 --> 31:41.358
You can figure this out,
and I really hope you do

31:41.392 --> 31:44.327
because he's gonna need
you now more than ever.

31:44.362 --> 31:45.562
What do you mean?

31:45.596 --> 31:49.232
Well, um, Tobias and
I are splitting up.

31:49.266 --> 31:50.700
Tobias is telling him right now.

31:50.735 --> 31:53.002
Um... You're getting divorced?

31:53.037 --> 31:55.972
Oh, no, hon. Uh...

31:56.006 --> 31:57.440
We were never really married.

31:57.475 --> 31:59.809
Except for that Navajo ceremony,

31:59.844 --> 32:01.845
but that was really more
of a group love thing.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.214
Anyway, we're going
our separate ways.

32:04.248 --> 32:06.216
But, um, why?

32:07.351 --> 32:09.386
We've been fighting a lot lately,

32:09.420 --> 32:13.823
and Tobias has this great opportunity
in Austin and I'd rather stay in Maine.

32:13.858 --> 32:16.693
I don't know. Some
things just stop working.

32:16.727 --> 32:21.331
The funny thing is, as soon as we
accepted it was going to be over,

32:21.365 --> 32:22.766
the fighting stopped.

32:24.135 --> 32:25.635
The pressure was off.

32:27.838 --> 32:30.073
But you guys seem to
really love each other.

32:30.107 --> 32:31.408
Isn't that worth fighting for?

32:31.442 --> 32:34.844
Not all relationships are
meant to last forever,

32:34.879 --> 32:37.080
even when you're in love.

32:37.114 --> 32:39.883
Some love stories
are short stories.

32:39.917 --> 32:43.286
But they are love
stories all the same.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.695
Oh, don't use these.
They have kind of sharp edges, OK?

32:52.730 --> 32:54.631
See you back at camp

32:54.665 --> 32:55.932
I'm gonna go do some yoga.

33:01.739 --> 33:05.141
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *

33:05.176 --> 33:10.880
* Ooh, yeah *

33:14.218 --> 33:15.852
Oh!

33:15.886 --> 33:19.522
I guess '80s bad taste
extends to beverages.

33:19.557 --> 33:21.958
Here's to the closing

33:21.992 --> 33:26.329
of the Rebecca Logan
chapter of my life.

33:26.363 --> 33:28.231
That was pretty convincing.

33:28.265 --> 33:30.800
Why are you still angsting?
Is it that stupid ticket stub?

33:30.835 --> 33:36.005
I can't start trying to
figure out her motives again.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.208
You know? It's too late.

33:38.242 --> 33:40.276
Right. You need to move on,
all right?

33:40.311 --> 33:42.078
You gotta find another
girl to talk to.

33:42.112 --> 33:45.181
Like, uh... Oh! Like her.

33:48.085 --> 33:50.720
- What? Katherine?
- Yeah

33:50.754 --> 33:55.492
I don't know.
She's a little... intense.

33:55.526 --> 33:58.027
You don't have to marry her.
Just talk to her.

33:58.062 --> 33:59.629
Get back on your feet.

33:59.663 --> 34:00.763
Yeah, yeah.

34:00.798 --> 34:02.432
You know what? You're right.

34:02.466 --> 34:05.435
You're right. I'm just gonna
throw myself back out there.

34:05.469 --> 34:06.703
All right.

34:11.375 --> 34:14.811
Hey, Katherine! You having fun?

34:14.844 --> 34:19.748
I was going to say I'm not
really into parties, but I won't.

34:19.783 --> 34:23.652
Based on recent events, I think I
need to be more of a people person.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.891
Um, well, hey,
can I buy you a drink?

34:28.926 --> 34:32.262
OK. A sloe gin fizz would be fine.

34:32.295 --> 34:33.530
OK.

34:37.333 --> 34:41.538
Oh my God, Rusty, I got so
caught up in your love story

34:41.572 --> 34:43.907
I forgot to put on my costume!

34:45.809 --> 34:46.809
Really?

34:54.018 --> 34:56.485
There. Flashdance.

34:57.221 --> 34:58.721
OK.

34:58.756 --> 35:00.657
Look, there she is and she's alone.

35:00.691 --> 35:02.926
Go talk to her!

35:02.960 --> 35:05.495
Wait, wait, wait!
What are you gonna say?

35:05.529 --> 35:08.498
Ash, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go off script on this one.

35:08.532 --> 35:11.901
Ooh, improv. How '90s.

35:11.936 --> 35:15.471
You're right. You go, you see her,

35:15.506 --> 35:18.408
you look her in the eye
and in that moment,

35:18.442 --> 35:19.943
you just know.

35:20.878 --> 35:21.878
Go.

35:26.584 --> 35:28.251
Katherine!

35:28.285 --> 35:32.121
Hey, sorry it took
so long... Rusty.

35:32.156 --> 35:34.624
The preppy jackass!

35:34.658 --> 35:35.625
What did you call me?

35:35.659 --> 35:37.393
You heard me.

35:37.428 --> 35:40.630
Now just excuse us.
I have to talk to Katherine.

35:40.664 --> 35:43.199
Yeah, well, you just
called me a jackass, so...

35:43.233 --> 35:45.301
Rusty, look, why don't
you just back off.

35:45.336 --> 35:47.971
Evan's in a rough spot,
he sorta broke up with Rebecca.

35:48.005 --> 35:52.108
Oh! So he found out she
slept with Beaver then?

35:52.142 --> 35:54.510
- What?
- Ooh.

35:54.545 --> 35:56.980
Beaver? That piece of crap?

35:57.014 --> 35:58.648
That's my brother
you're talking about.

35:58.682 --> 36:00.383
Your brother can
hardly stand upright.

36:02.586 --> 36:03.920
Rebecca didn't think so.

36:05.956 --> 36:08.591
Evan, what the hell?!

36:08.626 --> 36:11.094
You know what? You're right.
I feel a lot better.

36:12.896 --> 36:15.231
The preppy jackass strikes again.

36:23.642 --> 36:25.410
* I don't give a damn *

36:25.444 --> 36:27.912
* About the castle on the hill *

36:27.946 --> 36:30.615
* Or the gold that we could eat *

36:30.649 --> 36:33.184
* Or the horse you have for sale *

36:33.218 --> 36:36.187
* No, I'm getting kind of rich *

36:36.221 --> 36:38.990
* On the side of any soul *

36:39.024 --> 36:42.060
* Well, I *

36:45.030 --> 36:48.099
* I don't give a damn... *

36:48.133 --> 36:49.233
Are you OK?

36:49.268 --> 36:51.502
Yeah.

36:51.537 --> 36:54.138
Evan and I have kind of a history.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.506
Oh, dear.

36:57.309 --> 37:01.312
Can I ask... what you
wanted to talk to me about?

37:02.614 --> 37:04.682
Oh...

37:04.716 --> 37:06.317
I wanted to say...

37:12.357 --> 37:15.526
Hi. Happy '80s.

37:17.229 --> 37:19.997
Hi.

37:20.032 --> 37:21.799
Happy '80s to you.

37:23.869 --> 37:26.270
OK, see you later, Rusty.

37:26.305 --> 37:28.339
Bye, Katherine.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.542
Hey.

37:32.711 --> 37:34.512
What happened? Are you OK?

37:34.546 --> 37:36.747
Yeah. Evan's a jerk,

37:36.782 --> 37:39.851
but he stopped me
from making a mistake.

37:39.885 --> 37:42.220
What do you mean?

37:42.254 --> 37:45.857
I looked into her eyes,
like you said.

37:45.891 --> 37:51.829
I realized that I wanted a girl who
spits her gum out accidentally,

37:51.864 --> 37:54.465
and wears a maxi-pad
around her knee,

37:54.500 --> 37:58.636
and bakes really good maple
bars just to make me feel cozy.

37:58.670 --> 38:03.975
A girl who that enough
confidence to turn me down flat

38:04.009 --> 38:05.910
when I was dumb enough
to overlook her.

38:07.212 --> 38:09.780
That doesn't even sound
like a real person.

38:09.815 --> 38:11.149
It is.

38:11.183 --> 38:14.652
Katherine and I are a lot alike,
that's true.

38:14.686 --> 38:19.323
But Dana gives me something more.
She inspires me.

38:20.792 --> 38:24.095
She's proud of who she is.
That's who I want to be.

38:24.129 --> 38:25.163
That's who I want to be with.

38:25.197 --> 38:27.365
Oh, Rusty!

38:29.735 --> 38:31.202
Is that from Adventures
in Babysitting?

38:31.236 --> 38:34.639
It's not from anything.
That's how I feel.

38:34.673 --> 38:38.376
But I already left Dana a
message breaking our date.

38:38.410 --> 38:40.344
So it's too late.

38:40.379 --> 38:43.915
Maybe not yet.

38:43.949 --> 38:46.017
I have one more movie idea.

38:46.051 --> 38:48.019
Come on.

39:06.104 --> 39:07.104
Moi?

39:18.183 --> 39:20.885
So I guess you heard.

39:20.919 --> 39:23.154
I'm so sorry, Cap.

39:23.188 --> 39:26.190
You know, looking back at the past day,
all the signs were there.

39:28.126 --> 39:30.828
They weren't making out in front
of me nearly as much as usual.

39:32.631 --> 39:33.931
Oh.

39:37.469 --> 39:40.471
I'm sorry if I made
everything worse.

39:40.505 --> 39:43.941
But there's something I
want to talk to you about.

39:43.976 --> 39:45.576
Casey, I'm really not
in the mood right now...

39:45.611 --> 39:47.979
Wait. Just listen, OK?

39:52.718 --> 39:56.754
I'm sorry I tried to change you.
I won't do that anymore.

39:56.788 --> 40:02.426
I can accept you,
just the way you are.

40:03.729 --> 40:05.896
What about graduation? And May?

40:05.931 --> 40:07.999
We'll worry about that in May.

40:18.210 --> 40:22.246
Dana! Dana Stockwell!

40:22.281 --> 40:25.049
Crap. We forgot the Peter Gabriel.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.884
See if you can find
something on the radio.

40:26.918 --> 40:29.453
Wait...

40:31.857 --> 40:34.692
Yeah.

40:34.726 --> 40:37.461
Dana!

40:37.496 --> 40:38.996
It's Rusty!

40:39.031 --> 40:41.165
* It's all I can do *

40:41.199 --> 40:45.803
I made a mistake and I'm really,
really sorry!

40:45.837 --> 40:47.872
We are back and now with
the weather...

40:47.906 --> 40:50.174
- If you're there.
- Who're you Lloyd-Doblering?

40:51.476 --> 40:54.278
You. Didn't you get my message?

40:54.313 --> 40:57.448
Oh! Yeah. About captions? I agree.

40:57.482 --> 41:00.851
What? - There waa lot of static,
but you said we needed to talk?

41:00.886 --> 41:03.821
It sounded like you like...
captions?

41:03.855 --> 41:05.256
I assumed you meant
for the written report

41:05.290 --> 41:06.624
for the grant project.

41:06.658 --> 41:10.428
The... Yes. That is what I meant.

41:10.462 --> 41:15.666
Captions will make the
illustrations so much clearer!

41:15.701 --> 41:18.002
Did you need to talk to
me about anything else?

41:20.339 --> 41:22.039
No.

41:30.349 --> 41:31.716
That's the moment.

41:43.662 --> 41:44.795
Hey, Ash.

41:44.830 --> 41:46.464
Hey, happy camper!

41:48.100 --> 41:51.001
Oh no, it was that bad?

41:51.036 --> 41:56.006
Um... We camped. We ate. We talked.

41:56.041 --> 41:58.442
There was flute-playing.

41:58.477 --> 42:01.579
And I finally woke up.

42:01.613 --> 42:06.550
In a tent, right?
Was it really uncomfortable?

42:06.585 --> 42:11.322
Uh, it was surprisingly
comfortable once I let go.

42:11.356 --> 42:14.358
So, how are things with Cappie?

42:15.360 --> 42:17.194
Well, we're not fighting anymore.

42:17.229 --> 42:18.796
Oh, great.

42:18.830 --> 42:21.365
This whole time I've been
trying so hard to get him

42:21.400 --> 42:23.734
to wake up and face reality.

42:23.769 --> 42:28.973
But really, it was me who
needed to face reality.

42:29.007 --> 42:30.541
What do you mean?

42:36.314 --> 42:39.917
Cappie and I aren't
built to last, Ash.

42:39.951 --> 42:44.355
We work here, in college.

42:44.389 --> 42:46.690
And I don't think we'll
work anywhere else.

42:46.725 --> 42:49.593
No. You can make it work.

42:49.628 --> 42:53.798
There's... There's gotta be like,
a movie, or something.

42:53.832 --> 42:56.567
Why did I put all my DVDs away? Where's St.
Elmo's Fire?

42:56.601 --> 43:00.104
No, it's OK. It's OK, Ash. Um...

43:00.138 --> 43:01.505
I'm OK with it.

43:03.775 --> 43:07.711
Cappie and I aren't a movie.

43:07.746 --> 43:10.247
We're a short story.

43:10.282 --> 43:12.817
But a really good one.
