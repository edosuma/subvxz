WEBVTT

00:01.409 --> 00:03.043
You took a case
on contingency

00:03.078 --> 00:05.078
where every plaintiff
is dirt poor.

00:05.113 --> 00:06.046
Dump it.

00:06.081 --> 00:07.747
One of the victims
was my uncle Keith.

00:07.783 --> 00:09.683
Please, these people
need your help.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.818
They need someone like you
to fight for them,

00:11.853 --> 00:13.353
and I can't do it.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.055
Then what do you say
we do it together?

00:15.090 --> 00:16.222
I'd like to propose a change

00:16.258 --> 00:18.124
to the current
compensation formula.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.592
How many partners
do you have in your pocket

00:19.628 --> 00:20.794
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

00:20.829 --> 00:22.262
I can get 45%.

00:22.297 --> 00:23.430
I'm gonna get you
the difference.

00:23.465 --> 00:25.265
This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

00:25.300 --> 00:26.900
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

00:26.935 --> 00:28.168
You came to work for me,

00:28.203 --> 00:29.469
so now it's time
for you to decide.

00:29.521 --> 00:30.437
Are you with me or not?

00:30.472 --> 00:32.405
I just called
for a vote tomorrow,

00:32.441 --> 00:34.041
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

00:34.059 --> 00:36.242
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

Oh, hello.

00:51.143 --> 00:52.692
- I was just...
- Working.

00:52.728 --> 00:55.228
I see that,
but it's 7:30 in the morning.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.197
What are you doing here
so early?

00:57.199 --> 00:59.899
I like to get in
before the chaos starts.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.468
Tell you the truth,
I was under the impression

01:01.503 --> 01:03.636
that you wouldn't get in
till much later.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.071
I wanted to get a jump
on the day.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.874
Then maybe you should get
a jump on this.

01:07.909 --> 01:09.809
Why am I paying
Louis's laundry bill?

01:09.845 --> 01:10.944
Because if you pay it,

01:10.979 --> 01:12.712
he won't know
that we triple-starched

01:12.748 --> 01:13.780
all of his shirts.

01:13.815 --> 01:15.215
- We?
- Yes, we.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.450
He came after us.
We're coming after him.

01:17.486 --> 01:19.152
Did you think
I wouldn't have your back?

01:19.187 --> 01:20.187
You want the truth?

01:20.222 --> 01:21.588
I thought
you'd be asking for a raise

01:21.623 --> 01:22.956
after seeing
how much I make.

01:22.991 --> 01:24.524
I didn't look
at how much you make.

01:24.559 --> 01:25.759
And as far as I'm concerned,

01:25.794 --> 01:27.994
anyone who did
should be fired.

01:28.029 --> 01:29.479
You're all right, Gretchen.

01:29.531 --> 01:30.864
But for the time being,

01:30.899 --> 01:33.183
don't play any more jokes
on Louis.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.567
Mind if I ask why?

01:34.603 --> 01:35.969
Because I only play jokes
on people

01:36.004 --> 01:37.570
to express my affection
for them,

01:37.606 --> 01:41.107
and right now I have
no affection for Louis Litt.

01:43.011 --> 01:45.211
Looks like I got here
just in time.

01:45.213 --> 01:46.646
And why is that?

01:46.648 --> 01:47.914
Because I'm going
to ask you to do something

01:47.949 --> 01:49.215
you're not going
to want to do,

01:49.251 --> 01:50.650
only this time
you're going to do it.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.118
What didn't I do last time?

01:52.154 --> 01:55.188
I told you to apologize
to Louis.

01:55.223 --> 01:57.791
And I did, right before
he held hands with Jack Soloff

01:57.826 --> 01:59.976
and cut my earnings
in front of the entire firm.

02:00.011 --> 02:01.578
And if you hadn't have been
such a dick to Jack

02:01.613 --> 02:02.729
in the first place,

02:02.764 --> 02:04.497
Louis would have had
nowhere to go.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.099
This isn't about Louis,
is it?

02:06.134 --> 02:07.200
No, it isn't.

02:07.235 --> 02:08.701
I want you to bury
the hatchet with Jack.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.036
You mean you want me
to kiss his ass.

02:10.071 --> 02:11.471
I mean I want you
to figure out a way

02:11.506 --> 02:13.773
to make peace with a partner
whose influence is on the rise.

02:13.809 --> 02:15.041
That's kissing his ass.

02:15.043 --> 02:16.342
Well, if that's how
you want to look at it,

02:16.378 --> 02:18.845
then pucker up,
because that man is a threat,

02:18.880 --> 02:20.213
and he's aligned with Louis,

02:20.248 --> 02:22.682
and I am in no mood
for a power struggle.

02:31.993 --> 02:33.443
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:33.495 --> 02:34.944
I didn't hear
you leave today.

02:34.996 --> 02:36.596
That's because I left
at 5:00 in the morning,

02:36.631 --> 02:38.147
trying to get an early start
on this case.

02:38.183 --> 02:39.949
Mm.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.868
Uh, about that...

02:41.870 --> 02:43.536
I didn't want to say
anything last night

02:43.572 --> 02:45.171
because you were
so excited--

02:45.207 --> 02:47.941
But you're worried about me
working with your father.

02:47.976 --> 02:49.309
- Yes.
- Hmm.

02:49.344 --> 02:51.144
Mike, you're the two most
important men in my life.

02:51.179 --> 02:53.947
Neither of you back down
from a fight,

02:53.982 --> 02:55.548
and I'm just--

02:55.584 --> 02:57.851
I'm afraid you're gonna
end up hating each other.

03:01.189 --> 03:02.755
Rachel, do you hate
your father?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.657
Of course not.
I love my dad.

03:04.693 --> 03:07.026
And don't you have conflicts
with him all the time?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.779
Yes, I do,
but it's different.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.197
He's my family.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.333
Yeah, he's gonna be
my family too.

03:13.368 --> 03:15.018
And if I'm lucky,
I'm gonna fight with him

03:15.070 --> 03:17.036
about a lot of things
over the years.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.438
So why not start with a fight

03:18.473 --> 03:20.106
where we're both
on the same side?

03:20.141 --> 03:23.710
Okay, I trust you.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.812

to tell me

03:35.190 --> 03:36.756

is sitting in the lobby

03:36.791 --> 03:38.291
with an appointment
to see you.

03:38.326 --> 03:39.792
'Cause I'm pretty sure
he's not taking time

03:39.828 --> 03:41.694

to talk about centerpieces.

03:41.730 --> 03:43.763
No, he's not.

03:43.798 --> 03:47.867
He is here to co-counsel
the Kelton case.

03:47.903 --> 03:50.136
You mean the case
I explicitly told you to drop?

03:50.171 --> 03:52.872
I mean the case that you said
would cost a fortune to fund

03:52.874 --> 03:54.974
and you didn't wanna lay out
that kind of money for.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.043
I didn't want to lay it out
because this case is a loser.

03:57.095 --> 03:58.344
And I'm telling you
it's not.

03:58.396 --> 04:00.747
And even if it is,
I just took away our downside.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.416
By going behind my back
to our biggest competitor.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.184
Are you telling me that
you're scared of Robert Zane?

04:05.220 --> 04:06.719
I'd be a fool if I wasn't.

04:06.755 --> 04:08.388
And you're a fool
if you're not.

04:08.423 --> 04:09.689
We let that man
into our house,

04:09.724 --> 04:10.723
there's no telling
what he'll do.

04:10.759 --> 04:11.791
You know what, Jessica?

04:11.826 --> 04:12.892
If Harvey had done this,
you'd be pissed,

04:12.928 --> 04:13.860
but you'd let him
do it anyway.

04:13.895 --> 04:15.295
And you may be
as cocky as him,

04:15.330 --> 04:18.831
but you are not Harvey.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.184
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

04:21.236 --> 04:22.535
I guess I'll just
go tell Robert

04:22.570 --> 04:24.487
that we won't be working
together on this after all.

04:24.539 --> 04:27.006
You know damn well
if we tell him that now,

04:27.008 --> 04:29.609
I look weak.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.311

as good as Harvey.

we're taking
half the contingency.

And I'm here to respond.
I'm giving you 1/3.

05:27.502 --> 05:29.902
all I give a shit about
is keeping you in check.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.205
Which means, for the duration
of this matter,

05:32.240 --> 05:34.574
you will be treating

08:13.635 --> 08:15.135
Whoa, that must have hurt.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.670
Eh, it didn't hurt a bit, 'cause
I didn't mean it with her,

08:16.705 --> 08:18.271
and I'm not gonna do it
with you.

08:18.307 --> 08:20.073
See you in 10.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.676
Better make that 15.

08:29.234 --> 08:30.483
Heard you're looking for me.

08:30.485 --> 08:33.086
I was, because I wanted
to give you this.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.054
What's that?

08:34.089 --> 08:35.855
Directions to
Westchester Country Club.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.490
Why are you
giving them to me?

08:37.525 --> 08:39.592
Because I don't want you to be
late to your 11:30 tee time

08:39.628 --> 08:41.328
with Charles Barkley.

08:41.363 --> 08:43.496
I'm playing golf
with Charles Barkley?

08:43.498 --> 08:45.265
If you get there on time,
you are.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.833
If not and he starts whacking
at shit with his big club,

08:46.868 --> 08:47.784
he might kill someone.

08:47.836 --> 08:49.102
You'll miss the whole thing.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.738
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

08:51.773 --> 08:53.873
You're sucking up to me
'cause all of a sudden

08:53.909 --> 08:55.408
you realized I'm someone
to be reckoned with.

08:55.444 --> 08:56.609
That is what I'm doing.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.279
But you're a big golfer
and a bigger Barkley fan,

08:59.281 --> 09:01.781
and I thought we could use this
to get off to a fresh start.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.166
Here's the problem, Harvey.

09:03.201 --> 09:05.785
I don't give a shit
about Charles Barkley,

09:05.787 --> 09:07.420
and you don't give a shit
about me.

09:07.456 --> 09:09.622
Listen to me.
This is a gesture.

09:09.624 --> 09:10.757
Take it.

09:10.792 --> 09:12.258
I'm not gonna take it,

09:12.294 --> 09:13.593
and I'm gonna tell you why.

09:13.628 --> 09:14.961
Because you've never
treated me like a peer.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.381
You've only ever treated me
like competition.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.801
I'm trying very hard here.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.021
Well, you can stop trying,
because I'm not interested.

09:33.065 --> 09:35.782
Mr. Specter,
I swear he told me

09:35.817 --> 09:37.700
he was
a huge Charles Barkley fan.

09:37.736 --> 09:40.403
I'm sure he did,
but the problem is he lied,

09:40.455 --> 09:41.905
and you should've known it.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.830
Whatever you're doing,
put it back.

09:50.832 --> 09:52.749
- I need you.
- I can't.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.801
What do you mean, you can't?
We're about to go to war.

09:54.836 --> 09:56.553
I mean, I'm about
to go to war myself.

09:56.588 --> 09:57.837
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:57.839 --> 09:59.172
I'm taking a case
against Kelton Insurance.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.840
I gotta go meet the client
right now.

10:00.842 --> 10:02.058
Who the hell
authorized that?

10:02.094 --> 10:03.094
Jessica.

10:03.095 --> 10:04.761
You went to Jessica
instead of me?

10:04.813 --> 10:06.896
I didn't go to anyone,
all right?

10:06.932 --> 10:08.565
She came to me
after I took it.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.266
Well, I'm telling you, you're
gonna have to postpone it.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.901
Harvey, this case
is important.

10:11.937 --> 10:13.353
I'll tell you
what's important.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.405
I got a partner at this firm
coming at me.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.740
Well, I didn't know that
when I committed to this.

10:17.776 --> 10:19.359
What the hell? I thought
we were meeting in the lobby.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.411
You gotta be kidding me.
Your case is with him?

10:21.446 --> 10:22.829
You're damn right
it's with me.

10:22.864 --> 10:25.198
And we have
a first impression to make.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.783
I don't know what kind of law
you're teaching around here,

10:26.835 --> 10:28.668
but where I come from,
you show up on time.

10:28.703 --> 10:31.121
Let's go.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.105
You wanna go?

10:32.140 --> 10:33.473
Go.

10:40.732 --> 10:43.149
Jessica,
what can I do for you?

10:43.201 --> 10:44.784
You came to me
for some legal advice.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.152
Now I'm coming to you
for yours.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.021
Do I get to charge you
for it?

10:48.056 --> 10:50.023
You already do,
unless you suddenly

10:50.058 --> 10:52.058
started paying for law school
out of your own pocket.

10:52.093 --> 10:53.726
Free of charge it is.

10:53.762 --> 10:55.395
I want you to look this over

10:55.430 --> 10:58.798
and tell me if we have
any exposure.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.567
Okay, but this isn't a deal.

11:00.602 --> 11:01.602
This is a speech.

11:01.603 --> 11:02.669
I'm aware of that,

11:02.704 --> 11:04.270
but Gwen Barnes
is quite opinionated,

11:04.306 --> 11:05.705
and I don't want her
to say something

11:05.740 --> 11:07.140
that might get her sued.

11:07.175 --> 11:09.008
Dr. Gwendolyn Barnes?

11:09.044 --> 11:10.477
Do you have
a problem with her?

11:10.512 --> 11:12.278
No, not at all.
How much time do I have?

11:12.314 --> 11:13.546
Take as long as you want.

11:13.582 --> 11:15.262
Just make sure
whenever I come back for it,

11:15.267 --> 11:16.850
it's done.

11:18.353 --> 11:19.319
(Harvey)
What are you doing in here?

11:19.321 --> 11:20.703
I came to apologize.

11:20.739 --> 11:22.489
You don't need
to apologize.

11:22.541 --> 11:23.790
I was out of line.

11:23.792 --> 11:26.059
Soloff's an asshole,
and it wasn't your fault.

11:26.094 --> 11:29.345
No, you were right.
It was my fault.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.264
Well, what's done is done.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.850
If you don't mind,
I need to think right now.

11:33.902 --> 11:37.270
I'm sorry, Mr. Specter,
but what's done is not done.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.521
What are you talking about?

11:38.573 --> 11:41.774
I told you,
I got your back.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.326
What the hell is this?

11:43.361 --> 11:46.279
It's the bio of that asshole's
third biggest client.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.815
- And?
- Look where he's from.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.122
I appreciate you coming
all the way down here,

12:04.158 --> 12:05.824
but the last time
you came to me,

12:05.859 --> 12:08.460
you told me to sit tight,
and that was a week ago.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.429
Emma, I don't understand.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.496
What did you expect?

12:11.532 --> 12:13.332
I expected you to understand
what it feels like

12:13.367 --> 12:15.567
to be left hanging.

12:17.071 --> 12:18.503
Because if we can't
understand that,

12:18.539 --> 12:21.506
what's to stop us
from cutting and running

12:21.542 --> 12:23.041
when things get tough?

12:23.077 --> 12:25.160
And what is
gonna stop you?

12:25.212 --> 12:27.279
I know what's gonna
stop me.

12:27.314 --> 12:31.249
First year...you think
about it every day.

12:33.554 --> 12:36.955
You relive it.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.206
Doesn't matter
what you do.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.059
You can't get it
out of your head.

12:41.111 --> 12:43.695
People tell you
it's part of God's plan.

12:43.731 --> 12:46.698
Maybe they're right,
but it doesn't stop you

12:46.734 --> 12:48.066
from wanting
to punch them in the face

12:48.102 --> 12:50.035
every time they say it.

12:50.070 --> 12:53.372
Then time passes,

12:53.407 --> 12:56.341
two, three years.

12:56.377 --> 12:59.845
Maybe you even start
to feel normal.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.113
Maybe you start to believe

13:01.148 --> 13:05.684
that maybe this thing
won't actually scar you

13:05.719 --> 13:07.219
for the rest of your life.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.521
But then one day,

13:09.556 --> 13:11.823
something reminds you.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.660
A song or a...
or a smell.

13:17.698 --> 13:19.564
And it touches that nerve,
and all of a sudden,

13:19.600 --> 13:22.534
it's the day you got that news
all over again.

13:22.569 --> 13:26.171
So you have gone through
something like this yourself?

13:31.712 --> 13:35.514
I haven't just
gone through it.

13:35.549 --> 13:38.183
It's the entire reason
that I became a lawyer.

13:41.138 --> 13:43.155
And as far as it taking
as long as it did,

13:43.190 --> 13:46.992
it took a while
to work out the particulars.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.195
But I can assure you,

13:50.230 --> 13:51.730
it's worth the wait,

13:51.765 --> 13:54.065
because this right here,

13:54.101 --> 13:58.637
this is an all-star team,
and we're playing for you.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.141
Well...

14:07.431 --> 14:09.681
Where do I sign?

14:09.716 --> 14:11.750
All right,
we got that taken care of.

14:11.802 --> 14:12.802
Next step?

14:12.803 --> 14:14.136
Set up
a settlement conference.

14:14.171 --> 14:15.470
Got that right.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.606
You mean "You got that right,
partner."

14:17.641 --> 14:18.773
What the hell
are you talking about?

14:18.826 --> 14:20.192
You're the one
that said it yourself.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.993
You and me,
we're the all-star team.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.329
I meant I was the all-star.
You're the team.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.413
Oh, so I guess in this case

14:25.466 --> 14:27.415
the team just hit
the game-winning jumper.

14:27.468 --> 14:28.884
I got news for you, team,

14:28.936 --> 14:31.636
the game hasn't
even started yet.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.105
Mike, seriously,
back there,

14:34.141 --> 14:37.042
about your childhood,
I didn't really get it before.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.410
You got dealt a bad hand,

14:38.445 --> 14:39.678
and you pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps,

14:39.730 --> 14:40.812
and I respect that.

14:40.848 --> 14:42.481
Thanks, Robert.

14:42.516 --> 14:44.583
- You can call me "Dad."
- Really?

14:44.618 --> 14:47.352
No.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.870
So you know we're talking
about my father, right,

14:48.906 --> 14:50.455
who's no longer alive?

14:50.491 --> 14:52.791
- Yeah, I forgot that.
- You forgot that?

14:52.793 --> 14:55.510
The basis of your compliment
in the first place?

14:55.562 --> 14:58.396
You suck the fun
out of everything, don't you?

15:02.202 --> 15:03.919
You did this quickly.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.440
You gave me a job to do,
and I did it.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.975
And why did you leave it
on my desk

15:10.010 --> 15:11.610
instead of bringing it
to me directly?

15:11.645 --> 15:13.445
I just wanted to give you
a chance to look it over.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.713
And does that have something
to do with the fact

15:14.765 --> 15:16.464
that I asked you
to check it for exposure

15:16.517 --> 15:18.116
and not rewrite it?

15:18.151 --> 15:21.086
I know, I may have
overstepped my assignment.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.355
It's just Dr. Barnes
is the first black female

15:23.390 --> 15:26.024
chief of surgery
at a major New York hospital.

15:26.076 --> 15:27.659
She faced discrimination
at every turn,

15:27.694 --> 15:29.094
and she still got
the job done,

15:29.129 --> 15:33.098
so she doesn't need soaring
language to communicate that.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.699
I'll tell Dr. Barnes
you said that.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.835
So you're accepting
my changes?

15:36.870 --> 15:38.537
I'll present them to her
with my blessing.

15:38.572 --> 15:42.274
We'll see what she thinks.

15:42.326 --> 15:44.309
Jessica, um...

15:44.344 --> 15:48.146
if you ever have a case
with Dr. Barnes,

15:48.181 --> 15:49.748
I would love to be
a part of it.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.815
I have a better idea.

15:50.851 --> 15:54.786
Why don't you come
to the speech with me?

16:00.661 --> 16:02.627
That is exactly why
we need to figure out a way

16:02.629 --> 16:04.813
to get you on the board
of directors of Comcast.

16:04.848 --> 16:06.932
From your lips
to God's ears.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.667
Jack, I'm sorry.
Can I speak to you for a second?

16:08.702 --> 16:10.268
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.736
It'll only take a minute.
It's firm business.

16:11.772 --> 16:13.672
I'm afraid
it's not optional.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.273
I'm sorry to interrupt.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.943
Harvey Specter, by the way,
of Pearson Specter.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.646
This will only
take a second.

16:21.682 --> 16:23.348
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.250
You're trying to poach
my client.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.718
What makes you think
I'm trying to do that?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.954
Please, "Harvey Specter
of Pearson Specter."

16:28.989 --> 16:30.221
Let me tell you something,

16:30.257 --> 16:31.923
guy's been my client
for ten years.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.059
He's not leaving me
for the likes of you.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.393
Then I guess
our business here is done.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.828
What the hell is going on?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.363
Nothing's going on.
You're free.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.348
In fact,
I'll walk you back.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.702
Oh, look at that.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.086
Is that Charles Barkley
taking a selfie

16:45.138 --> 16:47.178
with your loyal client
who happened to have grown up

16:47.207 --> 16:48.974
in Philadelphia
during the Barkley era?

16:49.009 --> 16:51.009
Look, you might not
give a shit about Charles,

16:51.044 --> 16:53.244
but he sure as hell does.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.346
You son of a bitch.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.780
I'm sorry, Jack.
Could you repeat that?

16:55.816 --> 16:56.898
I couldn't hear you
over the sound

16:56.950 --> 16:58.149
of me taking your client.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.385
Then let me say it louder.
This isn't over.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.320
It better be, because you've got
four other clients

17:02.356 --> 17:04.823
from Chicago, Boston,
Los Angeles, and Houston.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.192
And you may not know
who those famous ballers are,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.176
but I do.

17:12.766 --> 17:16.067
Will, Jennifer, thank you for
seeing us on such short notice.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.486
Well, you did serve
our client with a lawsuit.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.805
Nevertheless,
we have an offer for you.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.579
You've gotta be kidding me.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.314
You called us all the way
down here for this?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.982
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with this.

17:31.034 --> 17:32.884
Well, Robert, we don't
look at it that way.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.754
How exactly
do you look at it, Will?

17:35.789 --> 17:38.023
We look at it as a gift
to a couple of vultures

17:38.058 --> 17:40.492
trying to pick the flesh
off the bones of an old case.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.726
That is what every lawyer

17:41.762 --> 17:43.662
who has had something to hide
has ever said.

17:43.697 --> 17:45.230
And it doesn't change the fact

17:45.265 --> 17:47.232
that your client
killed 200 people.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.367
Then we're gonna tell you
what we told the last attorney.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.019
You go to trial,
you'll be buried in paperwork

17:51.054 --> 17:52.370
for the next ten years.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.005
Well, if this were yesterday,

17:54.041 --> 17:55.674
then we might be rattled
by that.

17:55.709 --> 17:58.810
But since then, new information
has come to light.

17:58.862 --> 18:00.829
And what new information
is that?

18:00.864 --> 18:02.681
This is a list of everyone
who works at my firm.

18:02.716 --> 18:06.351
And this is a list
of everyone that works at mine.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.653
You see, we're not
some solo practitioner

18:08.689 --> 18:11.089
with a part-time paralegal
working out of a mall.

18:11.124 --> 18:15.660
What my associate is getting at
is we're two huge law firms,

18:15.696 --> 18:18.563
perfectly designed
to kick your ass.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.331
I don't care how many people
work at your firms.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.233
Someone needs
to pay their salaries.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.835
And if you're
working on this,

18:23.870 --> 18:25.236
you're not doing that.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.571
Then doesn't it
come in handy

18:26.606 --> 18:30.041
to have a $20-billion hedge fund
footing the bill?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.512
So you can either add
a bunch of zeroes

18:34.548 --> 18:37.298
to this bullshit offer,
or we'll see you in court.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.581
Mind if I ask you
a question?

18:49.617 --> 18:50.882
If it's about
using my connections

18:50.918 --> 18:52.851
to get Stevie Wonder
to play at your wedding,

18:52.903 --> 18:56.388
I already tried.

18:56.423 --> 18:59.024
Why didn't you tell me
about the hedge fund?

18:59.059 --> 19:00.225
Well, what difference
does it make

19:00.260 --> 19:01.360
where we get
our money from?

19:01.362 --> 19:02.527
It doesn't make
a difference,

19:02.563 --> 19:04.863
except for the fact
you didn't tell me.

19:04.898 --> 19:07.165
What are you getting
so bent out of shape for?

19:07.201 --> 19:08.667
We landed a punch
back there.

19:08.702 --> 19:10.268
We landed a punch
or you did?

19:10.270 --> 19:11.787
What's that
supposed to mean?

19:11.822 --> 19:14.222
First you call me "associate"
in front of opposing counsel,

19:14.258 --> 19:15.874
and now I find out
you're keeping things from me.

19:15.909 --> 19:16.925
Look--

19:16.960 --> 19:18.710
I'm just saying,
are we a team or not?

19:18.746 --> 19:20.879
I called you
what I called you in there

19:20.914 --> 19:22.614
because they want to see
someone in charge.

19:22.650 --> 19:26.351
And looking at the two of us,
they're gonna think it's me.

19:26.387 --> 19:28.420
And I didn't think
about telling you about Arcadian

19:28.455 --> 19:31.523
because I came up with that
when you weren't there.

19:32.843 --> 19:34.893
For the record,
I had the same idea.

19:34.928 --> 19:37.129
I went to a hedge fund
before I even came to you.

19:37.164 --> 19:38.196
Well, congratulations.

19:38.232 --> 19:39.898
If you had closed them
like I closed my guys,

19:39.933 --> 19:41.733
I wouldn't be standing here
explaining myself.

from these clowns.

Harvey just stole
one of my clients.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.091
I want him back.

20:06.126 --> 20:07.259
Do you have proof?

20:07.294 --> 20:09.177
Yeah, he orchestrated
some bullshit run-in

20:09.213 --> 20:10.429
with Charles Barkley,

20:10.464 --> 20:13.515
and miraculously my client,
he needs to make a change.

20:13.550 --> 20:15.267
Well, that's not proof.

20:15.302 --> 20:17.135
I don't need proof.
I know what the hell he did.

20:21.975 --> 20:23.275
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

20:23.310 --> 20:24.976
We'd be having
your exit interview.

20:25.028 --> 20:26.862
You gonna sling
accusations at me,

Let me tell you
something, Jack.

20:35.622 --> 20:38.707
When you went after Harvey,
you went after me,

20:38.742 --> 20:40.041

20:40.077 --> 20:42.127
that sent him after you

We got 'em on the ropes.
They're scared.

26:18.435 --> 26:20.768
Which is why
I scheduled a hearing

26:20.770 --> 26:22.937
with Judge Hernandez
for tomorrow morning.

26:22.989 --> 26:25.406
She's gonna dismiss
this bullshit,

26:25.442 --> 26:28.860
and I'm gonna get her to move
straight to trial.

26:30.747 --> 26:32.697
Uh, Robert,
that's a bad idea.

26:32.749 --> 26:33.948
What are you
talking about?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.868
They throw a jab,
we answer with a right cross.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.503
Yes, if we go to trial now,
we get a decision,

26:38.538 --> 26:40.121
but if we go in three months,
we get a knockout.

26:40.123 --> 26:41.456
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:41.458 --> 26:42.674
There's a bill
on the governor's desk

26:42.709 --> 26:44.259
waiting to be passed.

26:44.294 --> 26:45.960
It lifts the cap
on punitive damages.

26:45.962 --> 26:47.929
There's a reason
he hasn't signed it yet.

26:47.964 --> 26:49.797
The AMA is up his ass.

26:49.849 --> 26:51.432
We go now.

26:51.468 --> 26:54.502
The CEO of Kelton Insurance's
contract is up.

26:54.537 --> 26:56.220
He doesn't want
to be renegotiating

26:56.273 --> 26:57.772
while he's on the front page
of the <i> Journal</i>

26:57.807 --> 26:59.047
being accused
of killing people.

26:59.059 --> 27:00.441
That threat
takes these people

27:00.477 --> 27:02.810
from $1,000 per person
to $5,000,

27:02.812 --> 27:04.228
but if we actually
go to trial--

27:04.281 --> 27:07.615
If we go to trial,
we may get nothing.

27:07.651 --> 27:10.868
And I'm finished having
this conversation.

27:10.904 --> 27:12.987
So now I see where we stand.
We're not partners.

27:12.989 --> 27:13.989
I'm just the associate.

27:13.990 --> 27:15.290
You're the one
calling the shots.

27:15.325 --> 27:16.405
I thought I made that clear

27:16.409 --> 27:17.575
from the second
we started this thing.

27:17.627 --> 27:20.161
Now answer this motion,
get my motion done,

27:20.163 --> 27:21.496
and be in court
tomorrow morning,

27:21.498 --> 27:23.698
because this is gonna happen
whether you like it or not.

27:29.556 --> 27:31.172
Oh--what the hell?

27:31.224 --> 27:32.224
What the hell what?

27:32.258 --> 27:33.641
You spilled my coffee.

27:33.677 --> 27:35.059
You ran into me.

27:35.095 --> 27:36.728
I don't care
who ran into who.

27:36.763 --> 27:39.097
This is my office.
How about a little "excuse me"?

27:39.149 --> 27:41.316
Oh, okay, Harvey.
Excuse me.

27:41.351 --> 27:43.267
Feel free to send me
the bill for dry cleaning.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.903
I'm paying
for everything else around here.

27:54.364 --> 27:56.364
Donna, now is not
a good time.

27:56.366 --> 27:57.782
I don't care.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.234
I'm not a prize to be used
to get revenge on Louis.

28:00.270 --> 28:01.402
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:01.438 --> 28:02.770
Are you gonna deny
you told him

28:02.806 --> 28:03.905
that you were gonna
take me back?

28:03.940 --> 28:05.707
That is not what I said.

28:05.709 --> 28:07.091
No, do not lawyer me,

28:07.127 --> 28:08.626
because it may not be
exactly what you said,

28:08.678 --> 28:10.678
but don't try to tell me
it wasn't what you meant.

28:10.714 --> 28:11.763
Donna--

28:11.798 --> 28:12.880
And another thing,
what makes you think

28:12.932 --> 28:14.849
if I were ever to leave Louis

28:14.884 --> 28:18.302
that I would ever,
ever come back to you?

28:27.397 --> 28:29.230
Mr. Specter,
I know this is a bad time,

28:29.232 --> 28:30.865
but I have to remind you
that--

28:30.900 --> 28:33.634
I know!
Jessica wants to see me.

28:42.812 --> 28:44.762
Donna, hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

28:44.798 --> 28:46.514
It's actually not a good time
right this second.

28:46.549 --> 28:48.316
- It's important.
- [sighs]

28:48.351 --> 28:49.384
I just need to know if Harvey

28:49.419 --> 28:50.819
is still tight
with Judge Hernandez.

28:50.837 --> 28:51.986
Why?

28:52.022 --> 28:53.388
I need her to postpone
a hearing for me.

28:53.423 --> 28:54.355
You know what, Mike?

28:54.391 --> 28:55.523
If you want something
from Harvey,

28:55.558 --> 28:57.725
you're gonna have
to ask him yourself.

28:57.761 --> 28:59.527
(Harvey)
You wanted to see me?

28:59.562 --> 29:01.145
That was 12 hours ago.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.531
I was putting
some things in order.

29:03.583 --> 29:05.066
What things in order,

29:05.101 --> 29:06.918
stealing more
of Jack Soloff's clients?

29:06.970 --> 29:08.469
As a matter of fact, yes.

29:08.471 --> 29:09.637
God damn it, Harvey.

29:09.672 --> 29:11.506
Jessica, I went in there.
I tried to make peace.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.608
He spat in my face.

29:13.643 --> 29:15.143
I tried again.
He did it again.

29:15.178 --> 29:16.477
And I said,
"Enough is enough."

29:16.529 --> 29:18.413
Then you walk out the door.
You don't steal his clients.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.398
You know what?
This doesn't concern you.

29:20.433 --> 29:21.816
This is
between me and Jack.

29:21.851 --> 29:23.785
Oh, it was between you and Jack
until he came to me,

29:23.837 --> 29:25.853
and I had
to cover for you.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.221
You covered for me?

29:27.223 --> 29:28.423
Goddamn right I did.

29:28.458 --> 29:30.458
I told him sending you
after him was my idea

29:30.493 --> 29:31.493
in the first place.

29:31.494 --> 29:32.493
That's not covering for me.

29:32.529 --> 29:33.961
That's covering for you,

29:33.997 --> 29:36.130
because that should have been
your idea in the first place,

29:36.166 --> 29:38.332
instead of welcoming
every competitor we have

29:38.368 --> 29:40.268
into our offices
behind my back.

29:40.303 --> 29:41.536
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:41.571 --> 29:43.104
I'm talking
about Robert Zane

29:43.139 --> 29:46.040
and you bringing him in here
without consulting me.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.275
I didn't bring in shit.

29:47.310 --> 29:49.510
Mike Ross brought Zane in
without asking,

29:49.546 --> 29:51.512
and I had to pretend to be
on board with that too.

29:51.548 --> 29:54.098
And now you're hoping this leads
to what you always wanted.

29:54.150 --> 29:55.750
This thing's over,
Zane goes,

29:55.785 --> 29:57.318
and Mike heads
out the door with him.

29:57.353 --> 29:58.469
That's enough.

29:58.521 --> 30:00.655
You need to get yourself
under control right now.

30:00.690 --> 30:01.973
What the hell
are you talking about?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.608
I'm talking about
you have a problem,

30:03.660 --> 30:05.460
and it doesn't have
anything to do with me.

30:05.495 --> 30:06.861
And you just expose it
by bringing up

30:06.896 --> 30:09.030
some paranoid bullshit
about Mike Ross

30:09.082 --> 30:10.631
going with Robert Zane.

30:10.667 --> 30:13.401
Because this all started
when Donna left you,

30:13.436 --> 30:14.569
and now you're afraid

30:14.604 --> 30:16.304
that Mike's going to do
the same thing.

30:16.339 --> 30:17.572
So you better get

30:17.624 --> 30:19.373
your abandonment issues
under control,

30:19.375 --> 30:21.559
because Jack Soloff
is gonna keep coming,

30:21.594 --> 30:23.945
and now you're gonna
have to put him down.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.581
[heartbeat thumping]

30:31.421 --> 30:34.722
[indistinct voices]

30:46.102 --> 30:47.468
[slow motion]
Mr. Specter,

30:47.520 --> 30:51.906
Mike Ross is waiting for you
in your office.

30:51.941 --> 30:53.307
Hey, I need to talk to you.

30:53.343 --> 30:54.842
Not now.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.854
I know you're mad from before,
but I need a favor.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.546
I said not now.

30:58.581 --> 30:59.864
Harvey, what's going on
with you?

30:59.916 --> 31:02.700
Nothing's wrong.
I need a glass of water.

31:02.752 --> 31:04.719
What the hell
is going on?

31:04.771 --> 31:07.705
[heartbeat thumping]

31:12.762 --> 31:15.196
Okay,
I'm dialing 911.

31:15.231 --> 31:16.464
No, you're not.

31:16.499 --> 31:17.932
Yes, I am. You could be
having a heart attack.

31:17.967 --> 31:21.936
- It's not a heart attack.
- You don't know that.

31:21.938 --> 31:23.571
It's a panic attack.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.210
Oh, hate to interrupt
a special moment,

31:29.245 --> 31:33.247
but I thought you might wanna
take a gander at this.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.149
What the hell is that?

31:35.185 --> 31:37.618
If you recall,
our last proposal

31:37.654 --> 31:39.587
reduced contingent
compensation.

31:39.622 --> 31:42.356
This one wipes it out
altogether.

31:44.460 --> 31:46.260
What's the matter?
No snappy comeback?

31:46.296 --> 31:47.995
I've read the bylaws.
You can't do that.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.530
You doing his fighting
for him now?

31:49.566 --> 31:50.846
I don't care
what the bylaws say.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.600
I have Louis's backing.

31:52.652 --> 31:54.769
So either you
give back my client,

31:54.804 --> 31:56.804
or good luck
billing 2,500 hours a year

31:56.839 --> 31:58.756
like the rest of us.

32:00.143 --> 32:02.977
You go right ahead
and put your proposal to a vote.

32:03.012 --> 32:04.946
But by the time
this thing passes,

32:04.981 --> 32:06.547
I'll have
your other four clients.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.366
Bullshit, you couldn't have
gotten to them already.

32:08.401 --> 32:11.302
Go goddamn check.
They're already in play.

32:11.337 --> 32:13.154
You pass this thing,

32:13.189 --> 32:14.755
you won't be billing
anything at all.

32:14.791 --> 32:16.157
You're not gonna
get away with that.

32:16.159 --> 32:18.025
Wrong.
I didn't start this.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.360
But I'm gonna finish it.

32:19.412 --> 32:21.929
And when you said I only ever
looked at you as competition,

32:21.965 --> 32:23.164
you were wrong.

32:23.199 --> 32:25.466
I never looked at you
as anything at all.

32:37.714 --> 32:40.648
Are you all right?

32:40.683 --> 32:42.984
No.

32:56.783 --> 32:59.300
Is it true what you just said
about his clients?

32:59.335 --> 33:01.402
No, which is why
I need you

33:01.404 --> 33:02.570
to do anything
you have to do

33:02.572 --> 33:06.907
to convince him
this is happening.

33:06.909 --> 33:08.743
I'll get it done.

33:17.613 --> 33:20.114
[knocking]

33:20.150 --> 33:21.666
What are you doing here?

33:21.718 --> 33:23.134
This is my home.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.169
It's also your office.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.254
And that entrance
is right around there.

33:26.256 --> 33:28.056
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of my dinner.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.592
I called to set an appointment.
You didn't call back.

33:30.594 --> 33:31.726
Because I had patients.

33:31.761 --> 33:32.927
And what the hell am I?

33:32.929 --> 33:35.396
You're an ex-patient
I haven't seen in weeks,

33:35.432 --> 33:37.515
who ignored me when I said
that your panic attacks

33:37.567 --> 33:39.234
wouldn't stop
until you accepted the fact

33:39.269 --> 33:41.069
that your secretary
wasn't coming back.

33:41.104 --> 33:43.187
I did accept it,
and I had another one anyway.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.772
That's why I'm here.

33:44.824 --> 33:46.908
You mean you're here
to get more pills.

33:46.943 --> 33:48.326
Yes, I am.

33:48.361 --> 33:49.744
And what happened
to the ones I gave you?

33:49.779 --> 33:50.779
I threw them out.

33:50.780 --> 33:51.946
Bullshit, you didn't
throw them out.

33:51.998 --> 33:53.364
You ran out.

33:53.416 --> 33:54.699
No, I didn't run out.
I'm telling you the truth.

33:54.751 --> 33:55.833
Okay, well,
it doesn't matter,

33:55.869 --> 33:57.585
because I'm a psychiatrist,
not a pharmacy,

33:57.621 --> 33:59.287
and if you want my help,
you do it my way.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.755
You make regular appointments,

34:00.790 --> 34:02.624
and you commit
to doing the work.

34:02.626 --> 34:04.342
And you show up at my house
unannounced again,

34:04.377 --> 34:06.878
I'm calling the police.

34:06.930 --> 34:09.347
Do you have any time available
ten minutes from now?

34:12.185 --> 34:14.302
I want to give you time
to finish your dinner.

34:16.639 --> 34:20.358
[upbeat music]

34:20.393 --> 34:21.643
Is the car ready?

34:21.645 --> 34:25.362
It's downstairs
warming up, like you.

34:25.398 --> 34:26.813
What do you mean?

34:26.815 --> 34:28.733
Well, I received
the invitation

34:28.784 --> 34:30.652
and couldn't help but notice

34:30.704 --> 34:33.371
that Dr. Barnes
is in the program,

34:33.406 --> 34:35.907
and you're in the program too.

34:35.958 --> 34:38.376
Look at that, I am.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.661
Why didn't you tell me
it was your speech?

34:40.664 --> 34:41.795
I wanted
your honest opinion.

34:41.831 --> 34:42.797
But you didn't ask
for my opinion.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.465
You asked me to check it
for exposure.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.134
If there's one thing
I've noticed about you,

34:46.168 --> 34:47.835
it's that you give
your opinion

34:47.871 --> 34:49.971
whether it's asked for
or not.

34:51.675 --> 34:54.409
And why does my opinion
matter to you so much

34:54.444 --> 34:55.842
that you would
go through all this?

34:55.879 --> 34:58.546
Your opinion
doesn't matter to me.

34:58.598 --> 35:00.615
Your development does.

35:03.453 --> 35:04.719
What are you saying?

35:04.754 --> 35:09.757
Oh, you're gonna make me
say it out loud?

35:09.793 --> 35:11.159
You remind me of me.

35:11.194 --> 35:14.529
And what do I have to do
to get to be like you?

35:14.564 --> 35:16.164
Well, you should know.

35:16.199 --> 35:17.899
You read my damn speech.

35:19.069 --> 35:20.401
You mean I rewrote
your damn speech.

35:20.437 --> 35:22.370
Oh, shit, I said it.

35:22.405 --> 35:23.838
I'm going
to show you mercy,

35:23.873 --> 35:26.007
considering your dress choice.

35:26.042 --> 35:27.141
What's wrong with my dress?

35:32.615 --> 35:34.716
You wanna know the truth?

35:34.751 --> 35:36.984
I think you bottled up
your anger at Donna,

35:37.020 --> 35:38.519
let it out at Louis,

35:38.555 --> 35:39.487
and then when
it came back at you,

35:39.522 --> 35:40.455
you pushed it down again.

35:40.490 --> 35:41.422
That's bullshit.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.091
The clinical term
is displacement,

35:43.126 --> 35:45.393
and the cure for it is letting
your anger at Donna out.

35:45.428 --> 35:46.561
Well, I'm not gonna do that,

35:46.596 --> 35:48.563
because even if I would,
Donna's not here.

35:48.598 --> 35:50.531
No, I didn't say you had
to let it out at Donna.

35:50.567 --> 35:51.733
You can let it out at me.

35:51.768 --> 35:53.234
- That's stupid.
- No, it isn't.

35:53.269 --> 35:55.269
If she were here
right now,

35:55.305 --> 35:57.038
what's the first thing
that comes to your mind?

35:57.073 --> 35:58.473
Hey, Donna,
what are you doing here?

35:58.508 --> 36:00.708
What if I said,
"I'm here for you"?

36:00.744 --> 36:02.043
I'd say, "Shouldn't you be
at Louis's desk?"

36:02.078 --> 36:05.146
And what if I were?
How would that make you feel?

36:05.181 --> 36:07.148
It would make me feel like
role play is stupid,

36:07.183 --> 36:08.249
because you're not Donna,

36:08.284 --> 36:09.684
and I don't give a shit
what your degree says.

36:09.719 --> 36:10.818

go through this again

I'm a woman

36:18.094 --> 36:20.194

to get what you want.

36:20.230 --> 36:21.195
Bullying?
I'm paying you.

36:21.197 --> 36:22.613

that I exist

36:24.067 --> 36:25.266
Well, it goddamn should.

to Donna that way,

36:26.436 --> 36:27.668

was on the line

36:37.680 --> 36:39.480
and I was there for you
every step of the way,

36:39.482 --> 36:40.482
it meant nothing?

36:40.483 --> 36:41.783
It wasn't every step
of the way.

36:41.818 --> 36:44.085
You bailed out
the second I wanted more.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.254
That's when you decided
to betray me.

36:46.289 --> 36:48.923
How the hell is moving on
and putting myself first

36:48.958 --> 36:49.991

36:50.026 --> 36:51.125

to Louis to do it,

36:51.161 --> 36:52.293

37:48.818 --> 37:51.452
Your Honor, they just got
this case two days ago.

37:51.488 --> 37:54.155
They're using the timing of
our client's contract expiration

37:54.190 --> 37:55.623

37:55.658 --> 37:57.558
I have to say, Mr. Zane,
I find it hard to believe

37:57.594 --> 37:59.727
that in two days
you've found out enough

He thought it was nothing,

38:10.206 --> 38:12.707
but his wife insisted
he go to the hospital.

38:12.742 --> 38:13.841
When he got there,

38:13.877 --> 38:15.726
doctors couldn't find
anything wrong,

38:15.778 --> 38:19.981
but they wanted to keep him
for one extra day.

38:20.016 --> 38:21.482
Now unfortunately,

38:21.484 --> 38:23.651
Kelton Insurance
refused to pay.

38:23.686 --> 38:25.786
