00:00.569 --> 00:01.335
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.369 --> 00:02.369
Hey, Dad.

00:03.605 --> 00:05.272
Dad...

00:05.307 --> 00:07.441
I don't need a whole speech on
what a user our birth mother is.

00:07.476 --> 00:09.343
That doesn't mean I can't feel bad for her.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.445
Take some parenting classes
and get my baby girl back.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.116
- You have a kid?
- She's two. In a foster care like I was.

00:15.150 --> 00:18.185
I'm gonna get her back. My little Tasha.

00:18.220 --> 00:20.087
One minute, you're just cruising along,

00:20.122 --> 00:23.757
next minute, someone swoops
in and kills your dream.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.025
I'm never gonna get adopted.

00:25.060 --> 00:26.160
You don't know that.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.662
Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be.

00:30.031 --> 00:33.934
I gave up so much to be adopted.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:44.546 --> 00:45.479
We can't do this.

00:45.514 --> 00:47.681
But I'm not getting adopted.

00:47.716 --> 00:49.650
You don't know that.

00:49.684 --> 00:51.318
I love you.

00:54.389 --> 00:56.223
Brandon, I love you.

00:57.592 --> 00:59.460
I have to think about this...

01:00.495 --> 01:01.462
I have to...

01:46.508 --> 01:47.708
Uh... what exactly is that?

01:47.742 --> 01:49.577
It's the Grinch.

01:49.611 --> 01:52.379
- I made it in kindergarten.
- Were you blindfolded?

01:52.414 --> 01:55.382
Oh, look.. Baby's first Christmas.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.618
Ohh, look at you.

01:57.652 --> 02:02.122
I wonder who these are for.

02:02.157 --> 02:04.291
- Hmm... hmm...
- Hmm, I wonder...

02:08.029 --> 02:10.931
You guys are our babies and this
is your first Christmas with us.

02:10.966 --> 02:13.200
Photo op! Let's see what's in mine!

02:13.235 --> 02:16.170
Hold 'em up. Hold 'em up
there and say "cha-cha"!

02:16.204 --> 02:19.807
- Cha-cha.
- Photo bomb!

02:19.841 --> 02:22.743
- We need more decorations.
- We have all of Frank's plus ours.

02:22.777 --> 02:25.846
Gramps's are old-fashioned. Mr. Nesbit
next door, just blew up a giant snowman.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.915
- If we're gonna win, we need inflatables.
- Win what?

02:27.949 --> 02:29.783
- The contest.
- What contest?

02:29.818 --> 02:31.652
The homeowners' association.

02:31.686 --> 02:35.589
They give out prizes every year to the
best decorated house in the neighborhood.

02:35.624 --> 02:37.091
They give you a sign to put in your yard

02:37.125 --> 02:39.593
and then on Christmas Day the judges
come around and they hand out prizes.

02:39.628 --> 02:41.595
First place gets $250.

02:41.630 --> 02:44.431
Well, you gotta spend money to
make money. How much you need?

02:44.466 --> 02:45.633
Oh, no way, lady. Huh-uh!

02:45.667 --> 02:47.601
We're not spending any more
money on Christmas decorations.

02:47.636 --> 02:49.470
- We have plenty.
- You're not the boss of Grandma.

02:49.504 --> 02:51.305
No, I'm not, but I am the boss of you.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.341
Your mom's right. Just work with what
we've got and use your imagination.

02:54.376 --> 02:56.510
I don't have an imagination.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.113
That's true. You know what he
got me last year for Christmas?

02:59.147 --> 03:03.017
- What?
- A vibrating tooth brush from the 99-cent Store.

03:03.051 --> 03:05.185
- Eww!
- You sure it was a tooth brush?

03:05.220 --> 03:06.987
OK.

03:07.022 --> 03:09.223
I'm just saying if he's
my Secret Santa this year,

03:09.257 --> 03:11.925
- my Christmas is going to suck.
- Language.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.761
What's with our tree?
There's something missing.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.797
Presents?

03:16.831 --> 03:20.901
I mean, come on, Secret Santas
are for people who work in a bank.

03:20.935 --> 03:24.638
- Mother.
- It's a good thing that Santa Claus is coming to town.

03:24.673 --> 03:27.574
- Mm! Tinsel. We need tinsel.
- OK, you know what, Mother,

03:27.609 --> 03:29.777
I hope you didn't go overboard
this year with the presents.

03:29.811 --> 03:33.681
I did not. But I can't speak for St. Nick.

03:33.715 --> 03:35.783
OK, hey, listen, everybody.

03:35.817 --> 03:39.520
You know, this year, Christmas
is about spiritual not material.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.655
OK? It's not about the presents.

03:41.690 --> 03:45.392
It's about being together. We've been
blessed with Jude and Callie in our lives,

03:45.427 --> 03:48.395
and we don't need a stinking piece
of paper to make it official, do we?

03:48.430 --> 03:52.266
We're family. And I'll tell you what,

03:52.300 --> 03:56.203
this motley crew is the best
present I could ever ask for.

03:56.237 --> 03:59.306
- Amen.
- Amen!

03:59.341 --> 04:02.076
Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

04:02.143 --> 04:06.113
I hope the judge throws
the book at that Vito thug.

04:06.147 --> 04:09.216
- Vico.
- Vico.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.151
What kinda made up name is that?

04:11.186 --> 04:14.021
- Someone's here for Callie.
- Hello.

04:14.055 --> 04:17.991
I'm from the Mission Bay Giving Tree
and we're donating gifts to foster kids.

04:18.026 --> 04:19.660
Is Callie Jacob here?

04:19.694 --> 04:21.894
Yeah, I'm Callie.

04:21.930 --> 04:26.700
We hope you have a Merry Christmas
and find a forever family very soon.

04:26.735 --> 04:29.870
- Happy holidays.
- Thank you.

05:14.546 --> 05:18.546
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:20.422 --> 05:24.391
OK, let's get this cleaned up and
take these boxes to the garage, please.

05:27.462 --> 05:29.263
What am I supposed to do with this?

05:29.297 --> 05:31.698
I mean, I've never gotten
a pity present before.

05:31.733 --> 05:33.434
We always get them.

05:33.468 --> 05:34.668
But you're adopted.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.571
Well, yeah, but our names are
still on some list somewhere.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.407
And they come with no return
address so we don't know who to call.

05:40.442 --> 05:42.443
So you just keep them?

05:42.477 --> 05:45.446
Um... we put 'em under the tree
and open them on Christmas day.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.648
But then Moms make us donate them.

05:47.682 --> 05:50.617
Which kinda sucks because
sometimes we get good stuff.

05:50.652 --> 05:54.421
I guess that's what I'll do then.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.692
- Hey, have you got your gift yet?
- No.

05:58.694 --> 06:00.484
Do you wanna do some last
minute Christmas shopping?

06:00.518 --> 06:01.661
Yes, please.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.358
How did Jude take it? I mean,
that must have been a shock

06:08.393 --> 06:11.361
for him to find out he and
Callie have different dads.

06:11.396 --> 06:12.629
Yeah, it was.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.399
I think it was hard for him
to get adopted without Callie,

06:15.433 --> 06:17.568
but it doesn't change how close they are.

06:17.602 --> 06:19.336
Sharon, there's a UPS truck out front.

06:19.370 --> 06:22.272
Oh, thank God! I was so afraid
the gifts wouldn't arrive in time.

06:24.409 --> 06:27.711
I sincerely hope that she
did not go crazy this year.

06:27.746 --> 06:30.247
She can't afford to spend like this.

06:30.281 --> 06:32.316
Well, just be grateful
that your mom is here.

06:33.318 --> 06:35.252
Have you spoken to Dana?

06:35.286 --> 06:38.288
No, and I'm not going to
as long as they're with him.

06:38.757 --> 06:40.491
I mean...

06:40.525 --> 06:42.626
If they wanna let Nathan back
in their lives, that's fine.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.294
That's their business, but...

06:45.463 --> 06:47.664
... choosing to spend Christmas
with him instead of us?

06:49.534 --> 06:52.436
It's... it's just so insulting.

06:52.470 --> 06:54.438
I'm sorry, love.

06:54.472 --> 06:57.307
It is what it is.

06:57.342 --> 06:59.443
You know, I'm not gonna
let it ruin my holiday.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.315
I really have got to
go through these boxes.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.651
How long am I supposed to keep
my father's bank statements?

07:07.685 --> 07:09.553
Can they audit a dead person?

07:09.587 --> 07:11.288
They can audit the estate.

07:11.322 --> 07:13.457
Estate, that's funny. What estate?

07:13.491 --> 07:15.626
Well, he did give us a car, you know.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.629
With his entire savings I'm sure.

07:18.663 --> 07:20.497
He had to have had some money.

07:20.532 --> 07:23.333
On a policeman's pension?
That's funny. Let's see...

07:23.368 --> 07:25.235
Uh... when he died,

07:25.270 --> 07:29.439
he had exactly $300.52
in his checking account,

07:29.474 --> 07:31.608
a few thousand in his
savings, that's impressive,

07:31.643 --> 07:34.511
And a money market with...

07:34.546 --> 07:36.280
- Am I reading this right?
- What?

07:36.314 --> 07:37.381
Am I reading that right?

07:39.217 --> 07:41.985
$150,000? Did you know about this?

07:42.020 --> 07:43.987
Do I look like I knew about this?

07:44.022 --> 07:45.355
Well, where is it?

07:45.390 --> 07:49.159
I have no idea. The probate
lawyer did not mention it.

07:49.194 --> 07:52.996
Well, maybe Frank didn't
want you to know about it.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.199
Why?  Why?

07:55.233 --> 07:56.800
Maybe he left it to the church?

07:56.835 --> 07:58.101
Ooh... mm...

07:58.136 --> 08:00.904
Well, who else would he
leave it to, if not you?

08:07.846 --> 08:10.614
What do you think of the tree now?

08:19.168 --> 08:22.037
Well, you can't buy much with a $40 limit.

08:22.071 --> 08:24.039
Which is why we're not at the mall.

08:24.073 --> 08:26.341
So, come on, you can tell me who you got.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.909
No way.

08:27.944 --> 08:29.978
Fine. I won't tell you either then.

08:32.081 --> 08:35.049
But, you know, just for the
hell of it, is this your style?

08:35.083 --> 08:38.086
No. No. I'm not really a cuff girl.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.020
I see.

08:40.056 --> 08:42.791
But this is pretty.

08:42.825 --> 08:44.058
A hundred dollars?

08:45.995 --> 08:48.029
Pretty expensive. Hm.

09:03.679 --> 09:05.313
Need any help?

09:13.623 --> 09:16.224
Now this is the perfect gift for you.

09:16.259 --> 09:19.160
A kitchen table?

09:19.195 --> 09:21.329
Don't you remember, it was the
first thing you wanted to buy

09:21.364 --> 09:23.365
for your Independent Living apartment?

09:23.399 --> 09:24.432
Even over a flat screen TV.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.067
Or a couch.

09:26.102 --> 09:28.270
As I recall, the floor was
pretty comfortable, but...

09:32.942 --> 09:38.847
Well, if we wanna keep this Secret
Santa thing secret, we better split up.

09:38.881 --> 09:40.749
That's a good idea.

09:48.791 --> 09:49.958
How could you not tell me?

09:49.992 --> 09:51.526
Well...

09:51.561 --> 09:53.562
maybe I just didn't want
you to take it personally.

09:53.596 --> 09:54.930
Take what, personally?

09:54.964 --> 09:57.599
That I attract abundance in my life.

09:57.633 --> 09:59.601
Mom, you didn't attract this.

09:59.635 --> 10:02.470
You inherited $150,000

10:02.505 --> 10:05.340
because Dad never got around to
changing his will after the divorce.

10:05.408 --> 10:06.708
Maybe he chose not to.

10:06.742 --> 10:08.677
You know Frank was very tight with a buck.

10:08.711 --> 10:10.478
He could count every penny he ever made.

10:10.513 --> 10:12.280
Yes, and he could also procrastinate.

10:12.315 --> 10:14.416
I have a garage full of boxes he
never sorted through to prove it.

10:14.450 --> 10:16.318
Stef, it is what it is.

10:16.352 --> 10:18.353
Would you stop saying that?

10:21.123 --> 10:24.960
We have five kids to support,
Lena, and put through college.

10:24.994 --> 10:28.163
I highly doubt that Dad intended
to leave his money to a woman

10:28.197 --> 10:30.999
he was no longer married to and
really didn't get along with.

10:31.033 --> 10:34.869
- Hey, you know I'm right here.
- Yes, Mom. OK.

10:34.904 --> 10:38.940
Look, no offense, but Dad did not
approve of the way you spent money.

10:38.975 --> 10:41.076
Dad, or you?

10:41.110 --> 10:42.877
No, don't answer that, all right?

10:42.912 --> 10:45.814
There's three things that a family
shouldn't discuss at Christmastime:

10:45.848 --> 10:47.782
Politics, religion, and money.

10:47.817 --> 10:48.950
And a woman's real age.

10:48.985 --> 10:50.852
So let's just nip it in the bud

10:50.886 --> 10:53.421
before somebody actually does take offense.

11:08.337 --> 11:11.172
I thought it could help you get
over your fear of little dogs.

11:11.207 --> 11:12.407
Hey, that was on the down low.

11:12.441 --> 11:14.075
Ha!

11:14.110 --> 11:15.176
Well, Merry Christmas.

11:15.311 --> 11:17.345
I got something for you too.

11:19.415 --> 11:23.018
Wow, just what I've always
wanted. A job application.

11:23.052 --> 11:25.987
I talked to my boss and he's hirin' and
you said you wanted to make some money.

11:26.022 --> 11:27.188
Oh, totally. That would be fun.

11:27.223 --> 11:28.256
We'd get to work together.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.825
I'll ask my... Stef and Lena.

11:30.860 --> 11:31.960
You mean your moms?

11:33.829 --> 11:35.730
I'm not adopted yet.

11:35.765 --> 11:39.034
Which I was reminded of when this
lady from some charity came by

11:39.068 --> 11:41.603
to give the poor foster kid a present.

11:41.637 --> 11:44.039
So you gonna feel sorry for yourself
cause somebody gave you a present?

11:44.073 --> 11:46.741
You got people, OK?

11:55.384 --> 11:57.452
- You heard from your social worker?
- No.

11:58.688 --> 11:59.621
I'm sure you will.

11:59.655 --> 12:00.689
Tasha's gonna be turning two.

12:00.723 --> 12:02.457
I've done everything I'm supposed to

12:02.491 --> 12:04.426
and they still won't give me visitation.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.261
I can't even give my baby
girl a Christmas present.

12:06.295 --> 12:08.263
Well, do you get pictures at least?

12:08.297 --> 12:10.231
No. Not even.

12:11.534 --> 12:13.368
- But I seen her.
- Where?

12:13.402 --> 12:16.137
At the park, near where she
lives with her foster lady.

12:16.172 --> 12:18.440
How do you know where she lives?

12:18.474 --> 12:21.109
Social worker had her folder on the desk.

12:21.143 --> 12:23.278
If they find out that you've
been, like, stalking her,

12:23.312 --> 12:25.080
- you'll never get visitation.
- I'm not stalking her.

12:25.114 --> 12:27.182
- She's my kid.
- As long as she's in the system,

12:27.216 --> 12:29.117
she belongs to the state.

12:33.189 --> 12:35.857
Look, you just gotta be patient.

12:35.891 --> 12:39.794
Just keep doing everything right and you'll
get to see her. But don't go back to that park.

12:42.064 --> 12:43.765
OK.

12:50.773 --> 12:51.940
What's this?

12:51.974 --> 12:54.642
A list of gifts under $40 you can get me.

12:54.677 --> 12:56.644
- Just in case you drew my name.
- Don't worry, I didn't.

12:56.679 --> 12:58.546
Well, just keep that list
for future reference then.

13:01.450 --> 13:06.588
- Hey. Hey, you're, like, crafty, right?
- I prefer "artistic."

13:06.622 --> 13:08.556
Moms won't give me any money
for any more decorations,

13:08.591 --> 13:10.625
so I need to, like, make some or something.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.561
OK, hold up. You do not
need any more decorations.

13:13.596 --> 13:16.331
It's not about quantity, it's quality.

13:16.365 --> 13:19.467
You need a theme. Your
decorations should tell a story.

13:19.502 --> 13:21.469
That's why I need you. Please?

13:21.504 --> 13:24.272
What if I give you the $40
instead of getting you a gift?

13:24.306 --> 13:26.040
I knew you drew me.

13:26.075 --> 13:27.008
Come on, Mariana.

13:29.311 --> 13:34.082
OK, but I'm not doing any manual labor and I
also want a 20 percent commission if you win.

13:34.116 --> 13:35.316
- Fine.
- Oh, I'm not done.

13:35.351 --> 13:38.019
I also want total creative
control and final cut.

13:38.053 --> 13:39.988
- We're not making a movie.
- Those are my terms.

13:40.022 --> 13:42.824
- OK.
- I want it in writing.

13:44.126 --> 13:46.027
I can't believe she's not
the least bit chagrined

13:46.061 --> 13:48.897
- about inheriting Dad's money.
- Can we please stop talking about this?

13:48.931 --> 13:50.832
I mean, you know she's just gonna
flush it right down the toilet.

13:50.866 --> 13:52.567
You know what she got
the kids for Christmas?

13:52.601 --> 13:54.536
She got them electric
skateboards and Go-Pros.

13:54.570 --> 13:55.970
- What the heck is that?
- How do you know?

13:56.005 --> 13:57.939
I may have un-taped the little
corners of some of the presents.

13:57.973 --> 13:59.575
- Stef?
- What? I taped them back.

13:59.625 --> 14:00.759
- She's never gonna know.
- What are we getting?

14:00.793 --> 14:02.427
I don't know.

14:02.461 --> 14:04.993
The point is that...

14:05.027 --> 14:07.628
They don't need the top
ten gadgets of the year.

14:07.663 --> 14:09.564
What they need is a college education.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.065
There is nothing that
you can do about this.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.701
And I hate to say this, but you are
starting to sound a little bit petty.

14:15.537 --> 14:17.772
Oh, I sound petty? Well that's interesting.

14:17.806 --> 14:18.906
You're the one who won't
talk to your own mother

14:18.941 --> 14:20.742
because she's spending
Christmas with your brother.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.510
Half-brother.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.546
Half-brother?

14:26.682 --> 14:28.549
Have you seen the jingle bell napkin rings?

14:28.584 --> 14:29.784
Does it make a difference?

14:29.818 --> 14:31.519
Yes. I want the table to look festive.

14:31.553 --> 14:33.588
- No. I'm talking about Nathan.
- Really?

14:35.424 --> 14:37.625
We don't have the same mother.
So yes, it makes a difference.

14:37.659 --> 14:41.329
You can say that it doesn't.
But half is not full.

14:41.363 --> 14:43.197
I think they're in the garage.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.456
Found them.

15:10.526 --> 15:14.195
Would you care to reconsider
what you said about half-siblings?

15:14.229 --> 15:17.265
Especially in a house of adopted kids?

15:17.299 --> 15:19.100
What did I say?

15:19.134 --> 15:21.068
That half isn't the same as full.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.337
I meant...

15:23.372 --> 15:26.040
I meant a full sibling
who you grow up with.

15:26.074 --> 15:27.442
Who you live in the same house with.

15:27.476 --> 15:29.377
I barely knew Nathan.

15:29.411 --> 15:32.146
Why are you so hurt about
something he said once in anger?

15:32.181 --> 15:34.115
Once, to my mother's face.

15:34.149 --> 15:37.018
Who knows how many times
he said it behind her back?

15:37.052 --> 15:38.186
She's forgiven him.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.821
Well, I have not.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.989
- It's a word.
- A hateful word.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.858
Yes. An ugly, horrible word.

15:43.892 --> 15:46.727
And you know what, I've had
people call me a dyke to my face,

15:46.762 --> 15:49.931
who I know in their
hearts aren't homophobic.

15:49.965 --> 15:52.733
So what are you saying?
Hate the word, not the hater?

15:52.768 --> 15:54.902
I'm... I'm just saying that

15:54.937 --> 15:59.740
sometimes people use hateful words
because they hurt not because they hate.

16:01.443 --> 16:02.844
And he was so young and...

16:02.878 --> 16:06.747
you know, people grow
up, grow wiser, kinder.

16:08.750 --> 16:13.254
- And, uh, holding a grudge makes you...
- What?

16:13.288 --> 16:14.622
Makes you say hurtful things...

16:16.358 --> 16:18.392
... that I think Jude may have overheard.

16:27.402 --> 16:30.990
- Where's your brother?
- Which one?

16:30.993 --> 16:34.075
The pretty one with the unibrow.

16:35.110 --> 16:36.043
Jesus?

16:39.214 --> 16:41.182
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

16:41.216 --> 16:44.151
Somebody slashed this inflatable snowman.

16:44.186 --> 16:45.987
- Well, it wasn't me.
- Now listen here, sonny.

16:46.021 --> 16:48.990
I've won this contest three years in a row

16:49.024 --> 16:51.125
and I never had any problem with vandals

16:51.159 --> 16:53.895
until you decided to enter.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.730
So be warned,

16:55.764 --> 16:57.665
I will sit up all night

16:57.699 --> 17:00.801
to protect my decorations and my property.

17:00.836 --> 17:02.937
And anyone who trespasses

17:02.971 --> 17:06.874
will have me and the end of a
baseball bat to contend with.

17:13.382 --> 17:15.415
- You didn't... ?
- No.

17:15.450 --> 17:19.654
Well, now that we're getting death threats,
I might want to renegotiate my contract.

17:19.688 --> 17:22.290
You know, for hazard pay.

17:26.428 --> 17:29.397
Hey.

17:29.431 --> 17:30.565
Who's that for?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.069
I won't tell.

17:35.103 --> 17:36.437
Callie.

17:36.471 --> 17:38.172
Ohh.

17:39.074 --> 17:40.241
Can I see?

17:42.411 --> 17:45.146
Wow.

17:45.180 --> 17:46.948
It's gorgeous.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.184
I wanted to get her
something nice, since...

17:50.218 --> 17:52.053
... she didn't get adopted and stuff.

17:52.087 --> 17:53.988
And you got this for $40?

17:59.928 --> 18:03.864
Well, Callie sure is lucky to have
a brother with such good taste.

18:07.769 --> 18:09.604
You know, I have a brother.

18:10.906 --> 18:12.640
I don't talk about him very much.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.842
Well, at all, really.

18:16.645 --> 18:18.779
And why not?

18:18.814 --> 18:23.484
Well, my dad was married
before he met my mom.

18:23.518 --> 18:27.722
And he and his first wife
had a son named Nathan.

18:29.491 --> 18:30.558
And we didn't live in the same house.

18:30.592 --> 18:32.493
So we didn't get to share

18:32.527 --> 18:38.299
all those bonding experiences
that make siblings close.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.535
Is that why you don't talk about him?

18:41.570 --> 18:44.438
Because you didn't grow up together?

18:46.975 --> 18:49.110
No. It's more complicated than that.

18:50.946 --> 18:53.047
You see, he lived in
another state with his mom

18:53.081 --> 18:56.083
and when he did come to visit...

18:59.221 --> 19:00.888
... he wasn't...

19:05.093 --> 19:07.094
... he wasn't very nice.

19:11.594 --> 19:13.995
Well maybe he was jealous,

19:14.030 --> 19:18.433
because you got to live
with your dad and he didn't.

19:22.538 --> 19:24.372
You know, I think...

19:24.407 --> 19:26.608
I think maybe you're right.

19:28.744 --> 19:31.513
Grandma and G-Pa aren't coming this year

19:31.547 --> 19:34.416
because they're spending
Christmas with him.

19:35.685 --> 19:37.385
And I think...

19:39.422 --> 19:41.256
I don't know, I think maybe I was...

19:41.290 --> 19:43.525
... feeling a little jealous myself.

19:47.396 --> 19:50.298
And it made me say some things
that I really don't mean.

19:53.302 --> 19:55.003
Anyway...

19:59.008 --> 20:02.110
You know, Callie is going
to love that bracelet.

20:04.013 --> 20:05.780
But I hope you know you
don't have to make up

20:05.815 --> 20:07.749
for her not getting adopted or for anything

20:07.783 --> 20:10.752
with a special gift.

20:10.786 --> 20:12.787
She loves you

20:12.822 --> 20:14.923
and you're special enough.

20:34.577 --> 20:36.578
Um, excuse me?

20:38.481 --> 20:41.316
I was looking at this bracelet yesterday,

20:41.350 --> 20:45.287
and I guess I put it in my
pocket and forgot to pay.

20:48.257 --> 20:49.491
So anyways, I just...

20:49.525 --> 20:52.494
I wanted to bring it
back and say I'm sorry.

20:54.063 --> 20:55.330
Do you want to pay for it now?

20:56.499 --> 20:58.466
Um... How much is it again?

20:58.501 --> 21:00.168
A hundred bucks.

21:00.202 --> 21:02.037
Um...

21:02.071 --> 21:03.905
Yeah, that's a little over my budget.

21:03.939 --> 21:06.107
So, sorry.

21:06.142 --> 21:08.143
Wait... a minute.

21:10.146 --> 21:11.179
What's your budget?

21:13.015 --> 21:14.215
Forty bucks.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.901
You're lucky. This
bracelet just went on sale.

21:17.936 --> 21:18.936
60 percent off.

21:20.838 --> 21:22.806
Are... are you sure?

21:22.840 --> 21:23.874
I'm sure.

21:25.643 --> 21:27.778
But you better fork over the
cash before the sale ends.

21:34.619 --> 21:35.852
Happy Kwanzaa.

21:38.656 --> 21:40.757
S'up?

21:40.792 --> 21:46.530
Hey, uh, so my moms invited you to
come over tomorrow for Christmas.

21:46.564 --> 21:48.498
We're just gonna eat and watch movies.

21:48.533 --> 21:49.666
Sound good?

21:51.402 --> 21:52.336
Please come.

21:54.238 --> 21:56.173
OK. Thanks. What time?

21:56.207 --> 21:57.307
Anytime.

21:57.342 --> 21:59.309
All right. See ya tomorrow.

22:26.070 --> 22:27.871
Tasha.

22:37.740 --> 22:41.442
Doesn't everybody look lovely.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.472
Stefanie, how nice to see you in a dress.

22:44.506 --> 22:45.640
Thank you, Mother.

22:45.674 --> 22:47.842
I do, actually, wear dresses often.

22:47.876 --> 22:49.443
I wasn't implying you don't.

22:49.478 --> 22:51.412
- Really?
- What are these?

22:51.446 --> 22:53.447
It's a Lena thing. Just go with it.

22:53.482 --> 22:54.715
Put them on, let me see.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.485
- Let me see.
- What did you get, Jude?

22:57.519 --> 23:02.323
- It's a bow tie.
- Bow tie! Oh, handsome. Look at you.

23:02.357 --> 23:06.193
Very festive. Very nice.

23:07.496 --> 23:10.298
Hey, where's mine? What
did I get this year?

23:10.332 --> 23:14.135
You look fantastic.

23:14.169 --> 23:15.369
For you my love,

23:15.404 --> 23:17.271
straight from the hutch.

23:17.306 --> 23:19.040
That's a very fancy box.

23:19.074 --> 23:20.408
Ooh!

23:20.442 --> 23:23.344
Lena Adams Foster...

23:30.285 --> 23:31.252
Do you like them?

23:32.321 --> 23:33.854
They're beautiful.

23:33.889 --> 23:35.089
Let me see!

23:37.793 --> 23:39.960
Diamond earrings?!

23:39.995 --> 23:41.629
I want diamond earrings.

23:43.098 --> 23:44.732
Are you sure you like them?

23:44.766 --> 23:45.866
No... Yes, I do.

23:45.901 --> 23:47.034
I do, I just...

23:47.069 --> 23:49.503
I just hope they're not real.

23:49.538 --> 23:52.506
Oh, Stefanie, What a thing to
say. Of course they're real.

23:52.541 --> 23:54.508
I mean they are, aren't they?

23:54.543 --> 23:56.644
Yes. Yes, they're real.

23:56.678 --> 23:57.845
How many karats?

23:57.879 --> 24:00.781
I just, I meant that I hoped
they were not too expensive.

24:00.816 --> 24:03.451
- That's what I meant.
- Honey, after the year you've had,

24:03.485 --> 24:05.519
I thought you deserved something nice.

24:05.554 --> 24:07.722
Don't be such a
cheapskate, just put 'em on.

24:07.756 --> 24:09.657
Put them on!

24:13.328 --> 24:15.363
We said that we were not giving
each other gifts this year.

24:15.397 --> 24:16.464
No, but it's OK.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.531
- It's not OK.
- It's OK.

24:17.566 --> 24:21.202
It's not OK. I didn't get you anything.

24:22.504 --> 24:26.273
Well, I'm just glad that
someone living in this house

24:26.308 --> 24:28.042
has an abundant mind set.

24:28.076 --> 24:30.144
Don't you mean an abundant debt, Mom?

24:30.178 --> 24:32.980
I mean, after all, isn't that how you
were able to afford electric skateboards

24:33.014 --> 24:35.883
and extravagant beds
that we don't even want?

24:35.917 --> 24:37.952
We're getting electric skateboards?

24:37.986 --> 24:40.087
It wasn't extravagant.
It was a wedding gift.

24:40.122 --> 24:42.690
- OK. Just inappropriate.
- Stef, come on.

24:42.724 --> 24:44.692
I mean, a bed is a very personal thing.

24:44.726 --> 24:47.728
And not only did you buy
us a bed without asking us,

24:47.763 --> 24:48.896
but you got rid of the one that we love.

24:48.930 --> 24:51.599
Look, if you don't like the bed, please...

24:51.633 --> 24:53.567
We don't. We don't.

24:53.602 --> 24:54.702
Not everybody likes memory foam.

24:54.736 --> 24:56.771
And, you know, it's
practically ruined our sex life,

24:56.805 --> 24:58.806
with the up and the down and
the thing in the middle...

24:58.840 --> 25:00.775
- Is something burning?
- I mean, what would you think, Mom,

25:00.809 --> 25:03.511
if I went into your
underwear drawer and I, say,

25:03.545 --> 25:05.679
threw away all of your favorite pairs

25:05.714 --> 25:09.450
and filled it with nothing but thongs, hmm?

25:09.484 --> 25:12.486
Well, actually, I wear nothing
but thongs anyway. Want to see?

25:12.521 --> 25:15.423
No, Mother, I don't want to see your thong.

25:15.457 --> 25:18.526
The point is, Mom, is it's a very
personal and inappropriate gift.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.194
That's it.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.463
I'm sorry.

25:24.499 --> 25:26.200
But I have to say,

25:26.234 --> 25:29.136
I think you could use some new underwear.

25:29.171 --> 25:32.206
I was folding the laundry and I couldn't
help but notice yours are very sensible.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.008
Maybe that's part of the sex problem.

25:34.042 --> 25:36.043
You know what? It's not funny, Mom.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.378
- This is not funny.
- You're telling me?

25:37.412 --> 25:39.947
I'm the one who's got hurt feelings here.

25:39.981 --> 25:41.949
Well... burnt the lasagna.

25:45.821 --> 25:46.854
Honey, I'm sure that it's fine.

25:46.888 --> 25:48.789
No, it's not fine! It's not fine.

25:48.824 --> 25:50.024
And I'm sorry that I bought you a gift.

25:50.058 --> 25:51.992
And I'm sorry that your dad
didn't leave you his money.

25:52.027 --> 25:54.862
And I'm sorry that we didn't like the bed.

25:54.896 --> 25:56.630
But I'm trying to have a nice holiday

25:56.665 --> 25:58.833
and you and your mother are ruining it!

25:59.601 --> 26:00.534
Honey...

26:08.410 --> 26:10.678
♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪

26:10.712 --> 26:12.580
♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪

26:12.614 --> 26:14.648
♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪

26:14.683 --> 26:17.618
♪ And a happy new year ♪

26:17.652 --> 26:20.521
I'm so sorry. It's a bad time.

26:20.555 --> 26:22.256
Merry Christmas.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.131
Don't get up.

26:34.503 --> 26:36.303
Let's just eat.

26:44.946 --> 26:47.047
I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry.

26:49.050 --> 26:50.251
I'm so sorry.

26:57.893 --> 27:00.961
It's not that we don't
appreciate your generosity, Mom.

27:02.864 --> 27:04.932
I am just worried about my kids,

27:04.966 --> 27:08.969
and college, and you,

27:09.004 --> 27:11.906
when you get old and
have nothing to live on.

27:14.910 --> 27:16.777
Oh, for heaven's sake, Stefanie.

27:16.811 --> 27:19.547
I tried. I tried to apologize.

27:19.581 --> 27:21.749
Can we maybe, like, cut
around the burned part?

27:28.657 --> 27:30.558
- Open it.
- I don't want to open another present, Mother.

27:30.592 --> 27:32.526
Just open it!

27:56.117 --> 27:58.319
What is it?

27:58.353 --> 28:01.188
It's, uh...

28:02.190 --> 28:03.324
... college...

28:07.293 --> 28:10.161
college investment accounts for, uh...

28:10.229 --> 28:13.932
... for all of you.

28:16.369 --> 28:20.071
Did you think I was going to
keep all Frank's money for myself?

28:22.074 --> 28:23.274
You could have told me, Mom.

28:23.309 --> 28:26.077
I wanted it to be a surprise.

28:26.112 --> 28:30.915
If you haven't heard, tomorrow's Christmas.

28:32.818 --> 28:34.753
Well, I feel like an idiot.

28:36.122 --> 28:37.722
Every village has one.

28:37.757 --> 28:39.891
Yes, it does.

28:39.925 --> 28:41.993
I know you've been under a
lot of pressure. I know that.

28:42.028 --> 28:43.728
You're doing a great job, OK?

28:45.031 --> 28:48.933
You just have to have faith
that the universe will provide.

28:50.936 --> 28:53.471
Where do you think
Frank got all that money?

28:53.506 --> 28:55.674
I invested it.

28:55.708 --> 28:57.809
I was in on the dot com boom.

28:57.843 --> 29:01.746
You don't have to worry about me.

29:01.781 --> 29:05.550
I have plenty to live on in my old age.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.622
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.

29:10.656 --> 29:12.457
Thank you so much.

29:18.264 --> 29:20.632
And I love the earrings.

29:24.603 --> 29:28.139
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

29:28.174 --> 29:31.376
Jude and Callie, what do you think
of your first Fosters Christmas?

29:37.990 --> 29:40.380
_

29:47.359 --> 29:49.260
Daphne?

29:50.262 --> 29:52.030
Daphne?

30:06.926 --> 30:08.093
What did the social worker say?

30:08.127 --> 30:10.161
They want to adopt her. That's
why I haven't got visitation.

30:10.196 --> 30:12.964
Can she talk? I mean, can
she tell people who took her?

30:14.166 --> 30:15.233
No.

30:15.267 --> 30:16.835
Callie you can't get involved in this.

30:16.869 --> 30:17.869
You're still on probation.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.170
What if we dropped her at a fire station?

30:19.205 --> 30:21.239
No. That's, like, for infants.

30:21.273 --> 30:22.941
Not kids who've been kidnapped.

30:22.975 --> 30:25.810
And any safe place we take
her they're gonna use cameras.

30:25.845 --> 30:27.012
He's right.

30:27.046 --> 30:28.046
You can't get involved.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.147
I shouldn't have never called you.

30:29.181 --> 30:31.650
No, I'm already involved.
But you should go.

30:31.684 --> 30:34.586
Yeah, like I'm gonna leave you here
and go home like nothing happened.

30:36.622 --> 30:38.757
You said you know where Tasha lives?

30:42.628 --> 30:43.895
Jeez, you scared me.

30:43.929 --> 30:46.631
I brought you some hot cocoa.

30:46.666 --> 30:49.634
- Thanks.
- I can't believe you're sleeping outside.

30:49.669 --> 30:52.537
People are stealing decorations.

30:52.571 --> 30:54.673
Well, this is comfy.

30:54.707 --> 30:56.741
It's just for the night.

30:56.776 --> 30:58.543
So, listen.

30:58.577 --> 31:03.281
I was thinking about what I said
earlier about you giving terrible gifts.

31:03.315 --> 31:04.315
Wait, when did you say that?

31:04.350 --> 31:05.617
Oh, uh...

31:05.651 --> 31:07.552
Maybe you weren't there.

31:07.586 --> 31:09.354
Thanks a lot.

31:09.388 --> 31:12.524
Well look, anyway, um...

31:12.558 --> 31:15.393
this being Jude and Callie's
first Christmas with us

31:15.428 --> 31:19.130
got me thinking about our first Christmas.

31:19.165 --> 31:22.467
Or, well, our last Christmas with Ana.

31:22.501 --> 31:27.172
Or without her. Since she went out
to get high and never come back.

31:29.208 --> 31:31.242
We were five years old, and
we spent Christmas all alone.

31:31.277 --> 31:34.913
Why are you thinking about that?

31:34.947 --> 31:36.915
Because...

31:36.949 --> 31:39.984
I was scared and sad

31:40.019 --> 31:44.122
and you made me feel better.

31:44.156 --> 31:47.759
Even though you must have
been scared and sad, too.

31:49.061 --> 31:51.796
And you still always try
to make me feel better.

31:54.066 --> 31:56.835
And, well, that's a pretty awesome gift.

31:56.869 --> 31:59.971
So I just wanted to say thank you.

32:00.940 --> 32:03.007
So...

32:03.909 --> 32:06.444
So... you're gonna keep me company?

32:06.479 --> 32:08.613
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

32:08.648 --> 32:10.749
I don't sleep outdoors. But happy camping.

32:18.524 --> 32:20.392
That's the house.

32:20.426 --> 32:23.528
At least there aren't any cop cars.

32:23.562 --> 32:24.663
I'll take her.

32:24.697 --> 32:27.499
- Callie?
- No.

32:27.533 --> 32:29.467
I gotta do this.

32:29.502 --> 32:32.203
Drive around the corner.

32:32.238 --> 32:36.274
Wait like, five minutes and
if I don't come, take off.

32:41.347 --> 32:43.448
Shh...

32:43.482 --> 32:46.184
It's OK, baby, it's OK.

32:52.224 --> 32:56.027
Shh.

32:56.062 --> 32:58.897
Look at me. Look at me.

32:58.931 --> 33:01.933
Hey, keep this, OK?

33:01.967 --> 33:05.003
Take this with you and go to the door

33:05.037 --> 33:07.205
and you knock, OK?

33:08.908 --> 33:11.843
Go on, take this with
you, OK? Knock on the door.

33:35.735 --> 33:36.835
Tasha!

33:54.520 --> 33:56.621
- Hey?! Hey!
- You!

33:56.655 --> 33:59.424
Hey!

33:59.458 --> 34:01.626
I see you bums! Get outta here!

34:01.660 --> 34:04.529
Get out!

34:04.563 --> 34:06.664
No! Don't swing, don't swing! Don't swing!

34:14.473 --> 34:16.474
They broke my baby Jesus.

34:16.507 --> 34:18.342
What?

34:22.348 --> 34:26.184
I have to admit, you did
a nice job on your house.

34:26.217 --> 34:27.552
I like the theme.

34:27.585 --> 34:31.289
It's very... now.

34:31.322 --> 34:34.092
I have to give my sister credit for that.

34:34.126 --> 34:35.393
Ah!

34:35.427 --> 34:41.232
You know in my day, families
all had a mom and a dad.

34:41.266 --> 34:45.103
And everybody all looked the same.

34:45.137 --> 34:49.239
And if you had an adopted
kid, it was like a secret.

34:49.274 --> 34:50.942
You didn't tell anyone.

34:50.976 --> 34:53.311
It didn't matter how you all came together,

34:53.344 --> 34:58.282
it's just nice to have a big family.

35:00.219 --> 35:03.221
Especially around the holidays.

35:05.324 --> 35:06.991
What about your family?

35:07.026 --> 35:11.863
I got three kids, all grown,
scattered about the country.

35:11.897 --> 35:15.967
Since my wife died, they
don't make it out every year.

35:16.001 --> 35:18.202
They've got their own kids, you know,

35:18.237 --> 35:19.971
and they want to be home Christmas.

35:20.005 --> 35:22.040
Why don't you go see them?

35:22.074 --> 35:23.808
They ask me...

35:26.845 --> 35:28.680
... but I wanna be home, too.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.818
And anyway, I've got the contest.

35:33.852 --> 35:36.754
And I hate to break my winning streak.

35:36.789 --> 35:40.525
Although I think I got
some competition this year.

35:40.559 --> 35:42.760
Your house looks great, too.

35:42.795 --> 35:44.529
Yeah.

35:45.931 --> 35:50.468
I don't think those punks'll be
back to mess with the likes of us.

35:50.502 --> 35:51.736
Hey, thanks for the cocoa.

35:54.873 --> 35:57.742
Merry Christmas.

36:31.176 --> 36:32.343
Merry Christmas.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.434
Very funny, Mom.

36:58.070 --> 36:59.270
Not for you kids to see.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.039
Well, I certainly wouldn't want
to get you anything personal.

37:02.074 --> 37:06.010
- I think there's one for you, Sharon.
- Yes there is. Right there.

37:06.044 --> 37:09.313
Oh, thank you. What could this be?

37:13.886 --> 37:16.287
- Frank's ashes?
- Mom! Oh, my gosh.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.157
He definitely weighed more than that.

37:19.191 --> 37:21.192
How did you afford this?

37:21.226 --> 37:23.928
It was on sale.

37:23.962 --> 37:25.062
For real.

37:25.097 --> 37:27.198
I love it. Thank you.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.040
Merry Christmas!

37:36.074 --> 37:37.809
Merry Christmas.

37:37.843 --> 37:39.644
I'm so happy you called.

37:39.678 --> 37:41.746
- Oh! We miss you all.
- We miss you, too.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.815
Hold on. Let me put
your father on the phone.

37:43.849 --> 37:47.819
Actually... can you
put Nathan on the phone?

37:49.588 --> 37:50.688
Just a minute.

37:53.592 --> 37:54.792
Hi, Lena.

37:54.827 --> 37:56.527
Hi Nathan...

37:58.530 --> 38:00.565
Merry Christmas.

38:04.636 --> 38:06.404
Who's that from?

38:06.438 --> 38:07.805
Wyatt.

38:12.477 --> 38:13.511
Whoa, cool.

38:13.545 --> 38:17.448
Wow. Those are the foster presents?

38:17.482 --> 38:19.750
- Yeah.
- How did they know our names?

38:19.785 --> 38:22.587
I thought they only knew if you were
a boy or girl and how old you are.

38:22.621 --> 38:23.621
Can we keep them this year?

38:23.655 --> 38:25.356
Um, sure.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.534
What're you doing out here?

38:38.537 --> 38:41.339
I'm not really feeling
the Christmas spirit.

38:41.373 --> 38:43.341
I guess I can just return this then.

38:43.375 --> 38:45.343
Well, I'm definitely feeling presents.

38:48.647 --> 38:50.414
Here.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.520
Here, let me...

39:01.460 --> 39:03.527
Wow.

39:03.562 --> 39:05.196
Do you love it?

39:05.230 --> 39:06.364
Um...

39:09.334 --> 39:10.368
... yeah.

39:10.402 --> 39:12.436
It's... it's awesome.

39:12.471 --> 39:16.207
You can wear it when you
play for the Junior Symphony.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.176
Yeah...

39:21.580 --> 39:24.415
There might not be any symphony.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.152
Or piano for that matter.

39:28.186 --> 39:31.188
Brandon, you can't think like that.

39:33.125 --> 39:36.093
What if I'd given up and
gone into Independent Living?

39:36.128 --> 39:39.163
I'd have a kitchen table without
a family to sit around it.

39:45.304 --> 39:47.104
You really think I'd get you a cheesy tie?

39:49.141 --> 39:51.242
It's not, that, cheesy.

39:51.276 --> 39:53.244
Yeah, you are a terrible liar.

40:20.172 --> 40:21.205
I love it.

40:25.043 --> 40:26.010
For real.

40:31.249 --> 40:33.250
Let's promise each other,

40:33.285 --> 40:35.353
that no matter how many set backs

40:35.387 --> 40:38.055
or and stuff that gets in our way...

40:40.058 --> 40:42.226
... we never let each
other give up on our dreams.

41:51.363 --> 41:53.030
Come on, let's go.

41:58.236 --> 42:00.204
OK, let's go.

42:00.238 --> 42:01.939
Out of the way, please.
