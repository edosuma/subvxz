00:05.104 --> 00:08.073
[Haunting music]

00:08.519 --> 00:10.520
It was a beautiful old fireplace.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.958
The only thing was, it was boarded up.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.042
Built her house...

00:17.094 --> 00:19.662
It was beyond my wildest imagination.

00:19.696 --> 00:23.300
There was blood dripped around his head.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.335
Whatever's in there is coming out.

00:25.368 --> 00:27.271
And of the son.

00:27.304 --> 00:29.606
Something trying to get into my house.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.140
My heart stopped for a minute.

00:31.173 --> 00:32.208
Pull harder.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.243
What are you looking at, baby?

00:34.277 --> 00:35.878
Honey.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.780
- Mandy?
- Mommy!

00:37.813 --> 00:40.783
It was something evil.

00:40.816 --> 00:42.520
There was no one I could call.

01:10.513 --> 01:14.150
In 1984, my Dad passed.

01:14.183 --> 01:16.252
And it was devastating.

01:16.286 --> 01:17.754
I loved him so much.

01:21.691 --> 01:23.793
I was just 21 years old.

01:23.826 --> 01:27.011
I had a daughter, Mandy, and
I was pregnant with my son.

01:28.064 --> 01:29.666
Linda took it the hardest.

01:29.698 --> 01:32.402
She was the baby of the family.

01:32.435 --> 01:33.806
[Doorbell ringing]

01:35.539 --> 01:38.327
My boyfriend was a truck driver.

01:38.874 --> 01:41.043
Months at a time, I wouldn't see him,

01:41.076 --> 01:44.777
so I was on my own with Mandy a lot.

01:45.915 --> 01:49.286
Dad left us a small inheritance.

01:49.319 --> 01:53.090
He wanted to make sure that
we were taken care of.

01:53.123 --> 01:55.826
I felt like I needed to
stand on my own two feet.

01:56.421 --> 01:59.305
_

01:59.429 --> 02:03.700
So I started looking for a place to live,

02:03.733 --> 02:06.704
a place where I could raise my children.

02:09.372 --> 02:12.543
I seen this apartment building

02:12.575 --> 02:15.144
that was in a familiar neighborhood.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.281
It was gorgeous.

02:17.313 --> 02:19.549
This is the home for me and my babies.

02:29.693 --> 02:33.530
I remember it being there
since I was a kid.

02:33.562 --> 02:35.899
It was comforting, and it was perfect.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.905
Ow.

[Grunts]

02:44.007 --> 02:45.141
[Sighs]

02:45.175 --> 02:47.344
The one thing that really caught my eye

02:47.724 --> 02:49.727
was a beautiful old fireplace.

02:52.177 --> 02:55.214
The only thing was, it was boarded up.

02:55.246 --> 02:57.683
I thought maybe later on
when I had a bit more money

02:57.715 --> 03:01.453
that I might be able to restore it.

03:01.487 --> 03:04.169
[Door creaking]

03:11.797 --> 03:13.032
A few days later,

03:13.065 --> 03:15.001
I started fixing the back bedroom up,

03:15.034 --> 03:16.896
'cause that was gonna be Mandy's room.

03:36.388 --> 03:40.193
[Blowing and patting]

03:54.173 --> 03:56.982
In one corner of the room was a closet.

03:58.443 --> 03:59.744
When I opened it up,

03:59.778 --> 04:03.615
I noticed that there's an object in there.

04:13.559 --> 04:15.428
The object was round,

04:15.461 --> 04:19.177
and it had shapes and designs.

04:19.197 --> 04:22.169
It was pretty, so I kept looking at it.

04:22.202 --> 04:24.171
It felt like it had a meaning.

04:24.203 --> 04:26.473
So I didn't want to just
throw something away

04:26.506 --> 04:30.343
because I figured someone
will come back for this.

04:30.376 --> 04:33.480
So I hung it back into the closet.

04:33.894 --> 04:38.199
And I just didn't think about it again.

04:51.631 --> 04:54.100
After I got settled into my apartment,

04:54.133 --> 04:58.138
every morning I'm pulling my curtains over,

04:58.171 --> 05:01.943
and it's like there was no light beam.

05:01.976 --> 05:03.544
Nothing.

05:06.412 --> 05:08.615
And I thought, "well,
this is really strange."

05:11.051 --> 05:13.120
So I thought, "well, okay.

05:13.152 --> 05:16.189
Well, I'm just going to scrub them down

05:16.222 --> 05:19.193
and see if I can get them
to shine a little bit."

05:24.131 --> 05:26.933
[Breathing deeply]

05:26.967 --> 05:30.104
But still no light.

05:30.136 --> 05:32.339
It was almost like some kind of shield

05:32.373 --> 05:36.210
that kept the sun from
coming into the house.

05:36.243 --> 05:38.346
It was gloomy.

05:43.851 --> 05:48.022
[Siren wails and dog barks]

05:54.028 --> 05:56.198
As the evening started coming around,

05:56.231 --> 05:59.033
the atmosphere changed.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.836
It felt uneasy.

06:01.868 --> 06:05.539
There was a sense of... Not fear,

06:05.572 --> 06:07.976
but something's not right.

06:11.712 --> 06:16.150
I just put it down to
settling in, new place,

06:16.183 --> 06:19.253
and maybe being a little lonely.

06:21.822 --> 06:23.791
And I was always waiting to find out

06:23.824 --> 06:26.762
when Mandy's Dad would be in.

06:30.897 --> 06:34.835
[Hollow scraping]

06:46.813 --> 06:50.418
[Rattling]

06:58.793 --> 07:02.462
Hansel and Gretel went to bed
thinking they were in heaven.

07:02.525 --> 07:03.792
So at night,

07:03.825 --> 07:07.164
Mandy always looked forward
to her bedtime stories.

07:07.197 --> 07:10.200
But the old woman had only
pretended to be friendly.

07:11.433 --> 07:12.701
[Breathing]

07:12.734 --> 07:16.639
I'm hearing this really heavy breathing.

07:16.673 --> 07:19.543
And it's right by me.

07:22.044 --> 07:24.547
Had only pretended to be friendly.

07:24.580 --> 07:26.582
She was a wicked witch who was lying in

07:26.616 --> 07:27.984
waiting for children.

07:28.017 --> 07:31.488
So we're sitting there,
and I'm reading to her.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.788
She had built her house...

07:33.957 --> 07:36.260
[Heavy breathing]

07:38.561 --> 07:39.895
It was like...

07:39.928 --> 07:44.835
[Ragged breathing]

07:49.472 --> 07:52.584
The wicked witch thought,
"now I've got you!"

07:54.109 --> 07:57.446
[Sharp breathing]

08:02.685 --> 08:05.188
It was right at my left ear.

08:05.220 --> 08:08.457
Honey, you know what? It's getting late.

08:08.491 --> 08:10.159
Let's take this into your room, okay?

08:10.193 --> 08:12.596
- Okay.
- I'll meet you there.

08:12.628 --> 08:16.925
I started wondering, "what was that?"

08:18.267 --> 08:21.604
I couldn't get over the
breathing I kept hearing.

08:23.405 --> 08:24.540
I got to thinking,

08:24.573 --> 08:26.443
"I'm just tired. I'm stressed."

08:26.476 --> 08:29.012
I just tried to forget about it.

08:29.044 --> 08:30.558
It didn't happen.

08:35.018 --> 08:38.688
We Haven't been in the apartment
long when my cousin Jeanne

08:38.721 --> 08:41.077
ended up coming over to see me.

08:42.592 --> 08:43.893
It's pretty dark in here, hon.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.060
I joked with her.

08:45.093 --> 08:47.063
I said, "you need to wash your windows."

08:47.096 --> 08:50.166
And she gave me her Linda look.

08:50.198 --> 08:51.867
Mm.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.803
I was in the kitchen talking to her,

08:53.836 --> 08:55.238
and she was doing laundry.

08:55.270 --> 08:56.640
How are you feeling, anyway?

08:56.673 --> 08:57.731
Pregnant.

08:59.132 --> 09:01.611
I noticed Mandy nodding her head

09:01.644 --> 09:03.847
as if she's having a conversation.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.616
And she's answering back

09:06.649 --> 09:10.721
to whoever may be talking to her.

09:12.221 --> 09:13.722
What is Mandy doing?

09:13.755 --> 09:16.025
She was looking the same
place all the time.

09:16.058 --> 09:21.964
And it was always up like it
was somebody bigger than her.

09:21.997 --> 09:23.532
She's just playing.

09:23.566 --> 09:27.704
Well, I took it as a child's imagination.

09:27.736 --> 09:29.204
Isn't it strange, though?

09:29.237 --> 09:31.573
It's like she's talking to an adult.

09:31.606 --> 09:33.842
It's her imaginary playmate.

09:33.876 --> 09:37.279
And I said, Linda, "I've got five kids."

09:37.313 --> 09:39.780
None of them have ever done that.

09:40.717 --> 09:42.151
She's fine.

09:47.055 --> 09:48.224
Here you go.

09:55.298 --> 09:58.635
Because I had Mandy in bed in my room

09:58.668 --> 10:00.370
when I would have company,

10:00.403 --> 10:04.274
I pulled my bedroom door partway shut.

10:04.307 --> 10:10.414
So I turn around and my bedroom
door is pushed completely shut.

10:12.848 --> 10:15.984
I go over and I turn the knob,

10:16.018 --> 10:18.688
and I can't get in my bedroom.

10:18.721 --> 10:21.157
So I'm pushing on the door.

10:21.189 --> 10:22.725
- Mandy?
- Mommy!

10:22.759 --> 10:25.462
I was really concerned that an intruder

10:25.495 --> 10:26.496
had gotten into my home.

10:26.529 --> 10:27.463
Open up.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.032
Mommy! Mommy!

10:30.066 --> 10:31.334
Mandy!

10:31.366 --> 10:32.769
Mommy!

10:41.043 --> 10:44.914
- _
- Mandy? Mandy, honey.

10:44.947 --> 10:48.050
- _
- Mandy! Open up!

10:48.083 --> 10:51.053
And I'm going, "Mandy! Mandy!"

10:51.087 --> 10:52.722
Why are you shouting?

10:52.755 --> 10:55.457
I'm throwing my whole
body against this door,

10:55.491 --> 10:58.461
trying to get into my bedroom.

10:58.494 --> 11:00.263
What's the matter?

11:07.569 --> 11:09.872
Oh, my God. Honey!

11:09.905 --> 11:11.311
How did this get here?

11:13.876 --> 11:17.347
The bed had been lodged
up against the door.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.347
Is someone in here?

11:18.380 --> 11:19.815
I don't know.

11:19.848 --> 11:22.785
For someone to move something like that,

11:22.818 --> 11:25.629
it had to take a lot of strength.

11:25.690 --> 11:28.393
She couldn't understand why I was so upset

11:28.426 --> 11:31.296
and why I was yelling her name.

11:31.328 --> 11:34.065
I had a little girl to think about.

11:34.099 --> 11:37.703
I could feel something wasn't right.

11:37.735 --> 11:40.306
I was really scared.

11:48.145 --> 11:49.847
So the next morning, I get up.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.116
I'm getting a cup of coffee.

11:52.149 --> 11:55.419
I'm standing at the window.

11:55.452 --> 11:59.423
And I'm hearing this... Crack, crack.

11:59.456 --> 12:01.293
And it startled me a little bit.

12:01.326 --> 12:02.427
And I turn around,

12:02.460 --> 12:05.965
and I start hearing this creaking.

12:08.966 --> 12:12.937
I realize that it is
coming from the fireplace.

12:12.971 --> 12:14.905
I hear this loud pop.

12:14.938 --> 12:16.641
[Popping]

12:19.144 --> 12:23.048
I walk over and try to peek in there.

12:33.591 --> 12:36.861
But when I did, it stopped.

12:36.894 --> 12:40.932
So I just kind of let that go.

12:40.965 --> 12:43.902
I thought, "well, it might
have been a breeze...

12:49.908 --> 12:53.245
Or maybe a bird fell down there."

12:58.850 --> 13:00.118
You're not hearing what I'm saying.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.452
You sound like you're freaking out.

13:01.485 --> 13:03.221
So a couple days later,

13:03.254 --> 13:06.158
my phone rings and it's my boyfriend.

13:06.191 --> 13:08.994
And I start telling him what's going on.

13:09.027 --> 13:12.597
He's thinking that I got baby blues.

13:12.630 --> 13:17.202
He's trying to tell me that
it's just my imagination.

13:17.235 --> 13:18.870
It was very frustrating

13:18.903 --> 13:21.273
'cause this wasn't my imagination.

13:21.306 --> 13:22.507
- I love you.
- Bye.

13:22.539 --> 13:24.709
And it wasn't my hormones.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.799
I thought it was just time to
start getting Mandy used to

13:47.831 --> 13:51.303
sleeping in her new bedroom in the back

13:51.336 --> 13:55.106
so I would have more space
for the baby in my room.

14:08.318 --> 14:11.021
All of her toys are set up.

14:11.054 --> 14:13.090
It was so cute.

14:13.124 --> 14:14.692
Mandy!

14:14.726 --> 14:17.828
Come on, honey.

14:17.861 --> 14:20.998
What do you think of your room?

14:21.032 --> 14:22.434
I love it. Thank you.

14:22.466 --> 14:26.337
Yeah. Here, help mommy.

14:26.370 --> 14:27.972
There you go.

14:32.277 --> 14:34.613
Mommy worked very hard.

14:39.583 --> 14:42.219
I figure, well, the doors are open.

14:42.253 --> 14:44.956
If she needs me, I can hear her.

14:55.866 --> 14:57.668
It was around midnight.

14:57.702 --> 14:58.736
I'm lying in my bed.

15:01.472 --> 15:03.040
[Screaming]

15:03.073 --> 15:06.210
All of a sudden, I hear
this horrible scream.

15:06.244 --> 15:07.279
Mandy.

15:07.312 --> 15:10.849
The scream was just bloodcurdling.

15:10.881 --> 15:12.917
I ran so fast,

15:12.951 --> 15:14.786
like her life depended on it.

15:14.818 --> 15:16.320
Mandy!

15:16.354 --> 15:17.556
Mommy!

15:17.588 --> 15:19.523
The bed was just violently shaking.

15:19.557 --> 15:21.192
It was just banging so hard.

15:21.226 --> 15:22.461
Mandy!

15:22.494 --> 15:25.697
Mandy is hanging on, and she's screaming.

15:25.730 --> 15:27.231
Mommy!

15:27.264 --> 15:28.966
I grabbed her so fast.

15:31.101 --> 15:32.336
All I kept thinking was,

15:32.370 --> 15:34.373
"how am I going to protect my babies?"

15:39.644 --> 15:43.447
On the couch, honey. On the couch.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.783
Are you okay?

15:44.816 --> 15:46.585
So I'm sitting there,
and I'm holding Mandy.

15:46.618 --> 15:48.487
And I start hearing this sound.

15:48.519 --> 15:50.554
You're fine. You're fine.

15:50.587 --> 15:52.623
[Whimpering]

15:52.657 --> 15:54.526
It's the fireplace.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.928
[Rumbling and creaking]

15:57.961 --> 15:59.630
- What is that, mommy?
- I don't know.

15:59.663 --> 16:01.098
Stay there.

16:01.131 --> 16:05.769
The wood is popping, and
it's pushing outward.

16:05.803 --> 16:08.005
And I'm thinking, "oh, my God.

16:08.038 --> 16:11.175
Whatever's in there is coming out."

16:11.208 --> 16:13.811
My heart was pounding so hard.

16:13.845 --> 16:16.315
I thought it was going
to pound out my chest.

16:19.216 --> 16:20.751
I was terrified.

16:25.188 --> 16:27.692
There was something trying
to get into my house.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.561
Be careful, mommy!

16:33.331 --> 16:34.265
[Gasps]

16:41.905 --> 16:47.489
_

16:50.347 --> 16:55.819
I could see a shadow of a
shape pushing and scratching.

16:55.852 --> 16:57.454
And it wasn't no bird.

16:57.487 --> 16:58.823
It wasn't a draft.

17:13.170 --> 17:17.642
This was something trying to
come through that fireplace.

17:20.477 --> 17:22.179
Come on, hon. Come on.

17:22.213 --> 17:24.316
I turn around and I grab Mandy.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.585
And we went back into the bedroom.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.587
And at this point,

17:28.620 --> 17:31.924
I knew that something paranormal
was going on in my house.

17:34.324 --> 17:41.466
But I had that little tiny seed
of doubt that maybe it was me.

17:41.498 --> 17:45.437
Maybe I was going a little crazy.

17:49.273 --> 17:52.878
I kept Mandy close to me,
and I couldn't sleep.

17:54.344 --> 17:56.347
All I could do was pray for morning.

17:58.783 --> 18:00.452
Everything right now was revolving around

18:00.485 --> 18:02.987
keeping Mandy as safe as I could.

18:03.021 --> 18:09.127
And then my other big concern
was the baby coming.

18:09.159 --> 18:11.896
I don't have my Dad.

18:11.928 --> 18:15.566
My boyfriend was driving
a truck cross-country.

18:18.268 --> 18:19.570
It was late at night

18:19.603 --> 18:23.040
and there was no one I could call and say,

18:23.073 --> 18:25.276
"please come get me."

18:41.658 --> 18:44.062
I got up the next morning.

18:44.094 --> 18:46.497
I walked back into Mandy's bedroom.

18:51.968 --> 18:53.371
Everything was calm.

18:59.243 --> 19:01.279
I pulled the door shut

19:01.312 --> 19:03.548
and I never went back into that room.

19:05.949 --> 19:07.485
I didn't want to stay there,

19:07.517 --> 19:11.523
but I invested everything
I had in the apartment.

19:12.657 --> 19:14.893
Whatever was here,

19:14.926 --> 19:17.795
I was really hoping it would just go away.

19:20.363 --> 19:22.333
This was supposed to be our home.

19:24.802 --> 19:26.838
I decided to call my sister, Audrey,

19:26.870 --> 19:29.373
and ask her if she could come over.

19:34.011 --> 19:35.780
Mandy was asleep.

19:35.812 --> 19:38.783
- Hey.
- What's going on?

19:38.815 --> 19:41.685
It's the fireplace.

19:41.718 --> 19:42.920
[Heavy breathing]

19:42.954 --> 19:44.255
Then all of a sudden,

19:44.287 --> 19:51.662
there was a slow breathing
sound right next to my ear.

19:51.696 --> 19:54.099
And I got scared, and I jumped up.

19:54.131 --> 19:55.399
Audrey?

19:55.433 --> 19:58.069
I was trying to get it away from me.

19:58.101 --> 20:01.572
I was hitting at it.

20:01.606 --> 20:02.607
Are you okay?

20:02.639 --> 20:04.007
Audrey's standing there,

20:04.041 --> 20:06.110
and she's trying to SWAT
this thing away from her.

20:06.143 --> 20:08.145
And she's pushing it and fighting it,

20:08.178 --> 20:09.246
trying to swing it away.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.816
Linda?

20:11.849 --> 20:14.452
Something raised my arm up, just like this.

20:14.485 --> 20:15.553
Something's got me.

20:15.585 --> 20:17.187
- Audrey.
- Pull harder.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.655
Audrey.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.725
Something had a hold of her arm.

20:20.757 --> 20:22.659
And she's trying to help me.

20:22.693 --> 20:24.028
It was like a tug-of-war

20:24.061 --> 20:28.099
trying to get her away from this.

20:28.131 --> 20:31.668
It finally released me.

20:31.701 --> 20:34.204
She fell backwards and landed on the couch.

20:34.237 --> 20:35.539
We just hung on to each other.

20:35.572 --> 20:38.442
We just couldn't believe
what just happened.

20:38.476 --> 20:41.446
It was beyond my wildest imagination.

20:41.478 --> 20:44.014
She was breathing hard,
and her being pregnant...

20:44.047 --> 20:46.416
The baby's coming.

20:46.449 --> 20:48.553
I told Lin, I said, "we
need to get out of here."

20:48.585 --> 20:52.089
[Baby crying]

20:56.793 --> 20:58.763
Here we go.

20:58.795 --> 21:00.465
Your new home.

21:00.497 --> 21:02.866
He's beautiful, isn't he?

21:02.899 --> 21:06.036
Aaron is born, and he was beautiful.

21:06.070 --> 21:07.806
We went back home.

21:07.839 --> 21:09.808
Yeah.

21:09.841 --> 21:11.176
After she had the baby,

21:11.208 --> 21:13.277
she seemed almost like her old self again.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.216
[Light flickering]

21:18.248 --> 21:21.351
Okay. Go on in.

21:21.385 --> 21:23.988
Thanks.

21:24.021 --> 21:28.259
So I get him home, and nothing happens.

21:28.292 --> 21:31.428
It was very peaceful. It was calm.

21:31.462 --> 21:33.865
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

21:33.898 --> 21:37.034
Yeah, got to make a go at this.

21:37.068 --> 21:39.805
I felt like I turned a corner.

[Car alarm wailing]

22:18.341 --> 22:21.646
the popping and the
scratching from the fireplace

22:21.678 --> 22:23.581
gets so much worse.

[Banging]

22:24.715 --> 22:25.984
Stop.

22:26.016 --> 22:28.452
It's like something is trying to fight

22:28.485 --> 22:31.089
to get into the apartment.

22:31.121 --> 22:33.757
I was scared. I didn't know what to do.

22:33.791 --> 22:36.895
It was late, but I called my cousin Jeanne.

22:36.928 --> 22:38.396
[Phone ringing]

22:40.464 --> 22:41.599

What's wrong, sweetie?

22:45.703 --> 22:48.740
Jeanne, whatever's here, it won't go away.

22:48.773 --> 22:50.241
I'm not kidding!

Jeanne?

22:59.582 --> 23:02.253
The phone went dead.

23:02.285 --> 23:05.822
She sounded really anxious, stressed.

23:05.856 --> 23:07.558
"I need you here now."

23:07.591 --> 23:09.593
And I told her I'd be right over.

I've got to go over to Linda's.

23:12.964 --> 23:14.232
[Knocking]

23:17.168 --> 23:19.603
As soon as I walked in the door,

23:19.637 --> 23:23.174
she goes, "this place is haunted."

23:23.206 --> 23:24.742
She didn't tell stories.

23:24.774 --> 23:26.009
Come on, now.

23:26.043 --> 23:27.645
There's something in the fireplace.

23:27.678 --> 23:29.112
She had a lot to deal with.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.416
Come on, let's settle down a little, okay?

23:31.448 --> 23:34.052
She was by herself,
basically, raising them.

23:34.084 --> 23:36.921
I wanted to be there for
her as much as I could.

23:44.995 --> 23:46.697
You got a screwdriver?

23:46.731 --> 23:48.466
I thought maybe, you know,

23:48.498 --> 23:51.402
birds might have got down
in there, flopping around.

23:57.941 --> 24:00.143
I started taking the screws out.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.913
Whoever put the board there

24:01.946 --> 24:03.514
wanted to make sure it stayed up.

24:07.784 --> 24:10.021
I just got this really bad feeling

24:10.053 --> 24:12.489
that I shouldn't take the board off.

And I started putting the screws back in.

24:19.697 --> 24:20.898
What are you doing?

24:20.930 --> 24:22.332
And I just told her, I said,

"Linda, I don't think this
is meant to come down."

24:25.002 --> 24:27.138
Every time I take out a
screw, I get a worse feeling

24:27.170 --> 24:29.106
like this is something
I'm not supposed to do.

24:29.139 --> 24:30.441
I'm not going to take it off.

Something just...

25:09.112 --> 25:10.614
You guys need to get out of this apartment.

25:10.648 --> 25:11.616
You need to move.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.718
- And she started crying.
- Please come with me.

25:14.752 --> 25:16.687
She said the kids weren't safe there

25:16.719 --> 25:18.856
in that apartment.

25:24.495 --> 25:26.764
It was devastating.

25:26.796 --> 25:29.066
I suggested she come with me,

25:29.100 --> 25:31.069
and she said she couldn't.

25:31.101 --> 25:33.704
Your place is full without us being there.

25:33.736 --> 25:36.306
I couldn't pile in all my family, you know?

25:36.340 --> 25:37.942
They still had their life.

25:37.975 --> 25:39.476
I have to.

25:39.510 --> 25:44.315
So I was stuck in a place where
I couldn't keep my baby.

I'll stay.

She gathered up stuff, threw
it in a bag real quick,

25:59.196 --> 26:00.532
and I walked out of the apartment.

26:03.533 --> 26:06.536
I said, "I'll bring them
back tomorrow daylight."

26:06.570 --> 26:07.772
And I said, "okay."

It was my home...

Supposed to be my home.

27:17.140 --> 27:19.543
I crawled in bed, I turned the light off,

27:19.576 --> 27:20.744

All I could do was pray.

It let me up.

28:09.158 --> 28:12.562
that I didn't have any idea what it was.

28:12.595 --> 28:14.664
Maybe it's just all a bad dream.

28:14.697 --> 28:17.235
I started wondering if
it was all in my mind.

28:24.374 --> 28:27.744
I was lost on what direction to go.

28:27.777 --> 28:31.948
I didn't know what to do or who to go to.

28:31.982 --> 28:35.353
I couldn't leave the kids with my family,

because my first instinct was
my children should be with me.

31:06.169 --> 31:08.840
_
- There's something in there with my baby.

31:11.175 --> 31:12.243
Oh, my God.

31:12.275 --> 31:14.077
And I flipped the light on.

31:15.912 --> 31:17.481
Honey.

31:20.050 --> 31:22.587
And there was blood dripped around him.

31:29.025 --> 31:30.561
What is it?

31:30.593 --> 31:33.563
It was like almost somebody stood over him

31:33.597 --> 31:35.166
maybe with an eyedropper or something,

31:35.198 --> 31:36.801
just perfect spots.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.635
Where did all this blood come from?

31:38.668 --> 31:40.470
I don't know. There's no cuts.

31:40.504 --> 31:42.305
That's when we did start thinking,

31:42.339 --> 31:44.008
maybe a ritual.

31:44.041 --> 31:46.476
My God, it was going to take the baby.

31:46.510 --> 31:47.711
I'm checking everything,

31:47.744 --> 31:50.214
trying to figure out where this came from.

31:50.246 --> 31:51.948
I stripped him down.

31:51.982 --> 31:55.252
There was no marks, no cuts.

31:55.284 --> 31:59.255
- I don't get it.
- No reason for the blood.

31:59.289 --> 32:01.125
It doesn't make any sense.

32:06.362 --> 32:09.099
I felt helpless.

32:09.131 --> 32:10.834
I didn't know what to do.

32:17.474 --> 32:20.444
The children had to be protected.

32:20.476 --> 32:22.379
We're gonna call the church.

32:22.411 --> 32:25.081
We're gonna have a preacher
exorcise this house.

32:35.158 --> 32:36.694
In the name of the Father...

32:36.726 --> 32:40.430
The priest began to read from the Bible.

32:40.464 --> 32:43.033
And it was blessings.

32:43.065 --> 32:44.200
Amen.

32:44.234 --> 32:46.603
Amen.

32:46.637 --> 32:49.306
Amen.

32:49.339 --> 32:52.877
Most glorious prince of
the heavenly armies,

32:52.909 --> 32:54.477
Saint Michael the archangel...

32:54.511 --> 32:58.616
You could start hearing
the sound of muffling

32:58.649 --> 33:00.783
in the fireplace.

33:00.816 --> 33:02.452
My heart stopped for a minute.

33:02.485 --> 33:06.223
Against the rulers of
this world of darkness,

33:06.255 --> 33:09.726
against the spirits of
wickedness in the high places.

33:16.265 --> 33:19.269
[Crashing]

33:19.303 --> 33:21.906
It was like an invisible creature...

33:21.938 --> 33:25.743
And those who hate him flee before him.

33:25.775 --> 33:29.246
As smoke is driven away,
so are they driven.

33:42.258 --> 33:45.295
[Crashing]

33:45.329 --> 33:47.630
As wax melts before the fire...

33:47.664 --> 33:51.101
It ran and it hit Audrey's leg.

33:51.133 --> 33:52.135
[Yelps] What is that?

33:52.168 --> 33:53.303
We drive you...

33:53.337 --> 33:54.939
But you could hear whatever this was...

33:54.972 --> 33:58.108
It was going around the table
and it was going fast.

33:58.140 --> 34:01.745
All satanic powers flee before Him.

34:11.387 --> 34:13.723
It ran up the chimney.

34:13.755 --> 34:15.224
It went... [Pattering]

34:15.257 --> 34:17.995
You could hear it hitting
the inside of the wall.

34:25.034 --> 34:26.536
After it went up the chimney,

34:26.570 --> 34:29.505
everything got really, really quiet.

34:30.907 --> 34:35.312
But you could feel there was
a lightness in the air.

34:35.344 --> 34:39.382
The sun was starting to
shine through the windows.

34:39.416 --> 34:43.687
We were just ecstatic that this was over.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.621
She was going to be safe
and wouldn't be afraid

34:45.655 --> 34:48.992
to stay in that apartment
with her two babies.

34:53.764 --> 34:57.702
[Hammer pounding]

35:14.151 --> 35:15.820
- Thanks.
- Yep.

36:00.997 --> 36:03.734
I'll just get you some milk, honey.

36:09.372 --> 36:11.408
[Heavy breathing]

36:23.119 --> 36:24.554
[Phone ringing]

36:24.588 --> 36:26.390
My phone rings.

36:28.492 --> 36:31.428
[Phone ringing]

36:34.497 --> 36:35.566
Hello?

36:35.599 --> 36:37.568
It's the priest and he says...

36:37.601 --> 36:40.204
You need to get the babies and
get out of that apartment.

36:40.236 --> 36:41.972
- What?
- It's not gone.

36:42.005 --> 36:44.173
It's still there, Linda. I was attacked.

36:44.207 --> 36:45.943
This thing left bruises and...

36:45.976 --> 36:47.276
[Gasps]

36:47.309 --> 36:48.845
And at that point,

36:48.878 --> 36:52.648
I got sick to my stomach.

36:52.682 --> 36:55.252
Something was trying to
break through the board

36:55.285 --> 36:56.920
from the inside.

36:56.952 --> 36:59.288
But the board is nailed shut.

36:59.322 --> 37:01.825
Whatever this thing was, it was back.

37:01.858 --> 37:04.928
And it was just horrifying.

37:07.130 --> 37:11.401
Mandy, honey. Please, I need your help.

37:11.434 --> 37:14.204
Grab everything that you want.
We're going to auntie's tonight.

37:14.236 --> 37:17.073
Come on. Let's go.

37:19.008 --> 37:21.110
I need help with your brother.

37:21.144 --> 37:24.915
Mandy.

37:24.948 --> 37:27.184
No playtime right now.

37:27.216 --> 37:29.986
She says, "who is that, mommy?"

37:30.019 --> 37:31.354
Who's that, mommy?

37:31.387 --> 37:33.189
Who's who, honey?

37:33.222 --> 37:35.591
And she went quiet.

37:35.624 --> 37:37.026
And I'm looking, I'm like,

37:37.059 --> 37:39.061
"what are you looking at, baby?"

37:39.095 --> 37:40.164
Honey...

37:40.189 --> 37:43.525
When she moved her head towards me...

37:52.658 --> 37:53.659
- _
- Please, Mandy.

37:53.692 --> 37:57.578
- _
- Mandy, please. I need your help.

37:58.197 --> 37:59.332
Honey.

38:01.393 --> 38:03.393
_

38:04.302 --> 38:05.371
She had this grin.

38:05.404 --> 38:06.873
Mandy.

38:06.906 --> 38:07.873
Mandy.

38:07.906 --> 38:10.042
And her eyes weren't her eyes.

38:10.076 --> 38:12.048
They had turned black.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.448
It wasn't her.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.482
Mandy?

38:16.514 --> 38:18.083
Something took her.

38:18.116 --> 38:19.819
Come on.

38:19.851 --> 38:24.489
And I just grabbed her.

38:24.522 --> 38:27.926
Mommy?

38:27.960 --> 38:30.295
And it was Mandy again.

38:30.328 --> 38:33.951
She's looking at me and she...
She doesn't understand.

38:35.368 --> 38:36.802
Are you okay?

38:36.835 --> 38:40.872
How could I tell her that it
wasn't her I was looking at?

38:40.906 --> 38:43.576
She was just a baby.

38:43.609 --> 38:48.380
I was clinging on and I just
kept her right about me.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.719
My heart starts racing.

38:53.752 --> 38:55.788
I've got to get my kids out of here.

39:02.127 --> 39:04.029
I was done with the apartment.

39:04.063 --> 39:05.365
It was over.

39:17.375 --> 39:19.511
So a week or two later,

39:19.545 --> 39:21.647
I had a few things still
left in my apartment.

39:21.679 --> 39:24.717
And I asked my cousin Jeanne
if she would help me.

39:29.822 --> 39:31.658
[Door creaking]

39:36.529 --> 39:40.065
I went back in the back bedroom.

39:40.098 --> 39:41.466
I opened the closet door to see

39:41.500 --> 39:43.937
if there was anything else in the closet.

39:47.373 --> 39:49.876
And there was this thing hanging there.

39:55.947 --> 39:57.650
It was really odd-looking.

39:57.683 --> 39:59.786
I'd never seen anything like it before.

39:59.819 --> 40:03.589
And I called to Linda and I asked her...

40:03.621 --> 40:06.692
Linda, does this thing go too?

40:06.725 --> 40:07.726
What thing is that?

40:07.759 --> 40:09.562
Come here a sec.

40:15.301 --> 40:17.737
I said, "when I moved in here, I seen it,

40:17.770 --> 40:20.239
but I figured it just belonged here."

40:23.275 --> 40:26.179
I said, "doesn't that
look like a pentagram?"

40:26.212 --> 40:27.547
And she goes...

40:27.580 --> 40:28.714
Oh, my God.

40:28.746 --> 40:29.982
Yes.

40:30.014 --> 40:32.918
She's like, "this really
looks like this is..."

40:32.951 --> 40:34.319
Something evil.

40:34.353 --> 40:36.089
Something that a witch would work with.

40:42.127 --> 40:43.528
And at that moment,

40:43.562 --> 40:48.366
I got to remembering
that when I was a child,

40:48.400 --> 40:51.871
there was an old woman who
lived in this apartment.

40:51.904 --> 40:53.406
Come on, girls.

40:53.438 --> 40:57.342
The very same apartment that
I'm living in right now.

40:57.375 --> 41:00.278
It suddenly made sense to me.

41:00.312 --> 41:03.482
People used to always make a comment...

41:03.516 --> 41:06.819
There she is. There's the nasty old witch.

41:06.851 --> 41:08.987
"Don't go too close to her house.

41:09.020 --> 41:11.123
She's a witch, and she's mean."

41:13.192 --> 41:15.995
And it was very clear she
did not like children.

41:16.027 --> 41:18.531
She was always looking out the windows,

41:18.563 --> 41:22.000
especially when she heard kids out there.

41:22.034 --> 41:25.605
I couldn't believe that I did not remember

41:25.638 --> 41:29.475
about this woman living in my apartment

41:29.507 --> 41:32.478
and everybody accusing
her of being a witch.

41:38.917 --> 41:40.285
How could I forget that?

41:40.319 --> 41:42.922
She kept shaking her head,
"how could I forget that?"

41:42.955 --> 41:44.090
I said, "well, Linda..."

41:44.123 --> 41:45.191
It was a long time ago.

41:45.223 --> 41:48.493
You were, what, six, seven years old?

41:48.527 --> 41:50.730
I said, "let's get out of here now."

41:50.763 --> 41:53.732
And so we grabbed the other
boxes from that room

41:53.766 --> 41:56.936
and we were gone in no time flat.

42:19.924 --> 42:25.497
I knew in my heart that
I may never truly know

42:25.531 --> 42:28.268
what really was in that apartment.

42:34.239 --> 42:36.676
I didn't know if it was the soul

42:36.708 --> 42:39.779
of this old woman tormenting me

42:39.812 --> 42:42.447
or if it was something that
she may have conjured up.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.683
These are things I'll never know.
