WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.205
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT
TO KEEP THINGS CASUAL.

00:04.205 --> 00:07.007
SUSAN MADE HER FEELINGS CLEAR.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.041
SO IF I WAS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,
THAT WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU?
 NO, IT WOULDN'T.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.212
YOU WORK HERE?

00:11.212 --> 00:13.744
I'M GREAT WITH FOOD.
I UNDERSTAND BUSINESS.

00:13.744 --> 00:16.387
BREE MADE ORSON A PARTNER.

00:16.387 --> 00:19.220
IS SHE STILL ASKING YOU
QUESTIONS ABOUT ME?
 A FEW.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.293
AND DAVE TOOK STEPS TO GET
KAREN McCLUSKEY OUT OF THE WAY.

00:22.293 --> 00:26.127
YOU THINK YOU CAN SCREW WITH ME?
 (all screaming)

00:26.127 --> 00:28.799
(Edie) KAREN!
 STOP DOING THAT.

00:33.164 --> 00:36.167
(Mary Alice) AS A MASSEUR
FOR THE FAIRVIEW COUNTRY CLUB,

00:36.167 --> 00:38.209
CARLOS SOLIS
HAD BECOME AN EXPERT

00:38.209 --> 00:41.072
ON HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HAPPY.

00:42.773 --> 00:45.546
THAT'S WHY HE ALWAYS HAD
SCENTED CANDLES WAITING

00:45.546 --> 00:48.349
FOR SUE BRIDGES...

00:48.349 --> 00:53.524
NEW AGE MUSIC
FOR BETSY DANIEL...

00:53.524 --> 00:58.629
AND APPLE SCHNAPPS
FOR SHANNON GLENN.

01:00.161 --> 01:04.165
YES, CARLOS HAD MADE
A LOT OF WOMEN HAPPY

01:04.165 --> 01:07.138
OVER THE YEARS.

01:07.138 --> 01:12.103
BUT ON ONE VERY UNUSUAL
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...

01:12.103 --> 01:14.745
HE MADE
MRS. VIRGINIA HILDEBRAND

01:14.745 --> 01:17.248
A LITTLE HAPPIER...

01:17.248 --> 01:20.181
THAN HE INTENDED.

01:24.555 --> 01:26.857
HELEN SAID YOUR LAST RESERVATION
JUST CANCELED.

01:26.857 --> 01:29.860
DO YOU WANT A RIDE HOME?
 THANKS, CLAY.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

01:29.860 --> 01:34.094
UM... CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
HOW LONG YOU BEEN A MASSEUR?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.766
14 YEARS.

01:35.766 --> 01:39.170
OKAY.
AND IN ALL THOSE YEARS...

01:39.170 --> 01:42.633
HAVE YOU EVER ACCIDENTALLY
GIVEN A WOMAN...

01:42.633 --> 01:44.735
AN ORGASM?
 AN ORGASM?!

01:44.735 --> 01:47.578
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
YOU WANT TO GET ME FIRED?

01:47.578 --> 01:51.882
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY
GIVE A WOMAN AN ORGASM?
 I DON'T KNOW.

01:51.882 --> 01:56.116
I CAN BARELY GIVE MY GIRLFRIEND
ONE, AND I TRY REALLY HARD.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.149
ALL I DID
WAS TOUCH HER BACK.

01:58.149 --> 01:59.820
ARE YOU SURE?

01:59.820 --> 02:02.693
SOME OF THESE OLD BROADS--
THEIR BODIES DROP.

02:02.693 --> 02:05.356
NOT EVERYTHING'S
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

02:05.356 --> 02:08.658
I MAY BE BLIND, BUT MY SENSE
OF TOUCH IS JUST FINE.

02:08.658 --> 02:11.162
WELL, THEN MAYBE SHE JUST
REALLY LIKED THE MASSAGE.

02:11.162 --> 02:14.835
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE MOANERS I GET ON MY TABLE.
 I'M TELLING YOU,
HER BODY WAS QUIVERING,

02:14.835 --> 02:16.337
AND SHE COULD BARELY BREATHE.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.840
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THERE'S ONE
SURE-FIRE WAY TO FIND OUT.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.343
WHERE'S YOUR TIP ENVELOPE?
 ON THE COUNTER.

02:24.715 --> 02:26.877
HOW MUCH SHE LEAVE ME?

02:28.619 --> 02:31.151
ENOUGH FOR TWO ORGASMS.

02:33.184 --> 02:35.826
YES...

02:35.826 --> 02:40.631
CARLOS SOLIS WAS AN EXPERT
ON HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HAPPY.

02:40.631 --> 02:44.295
I'M ABOUT TO GO GET GROCERIES.
WHERE ARE YOUR TIPS?

02:46.797 --> 02:50.371
OH, MY GOD!
HOW DID YOU GET SO MUCH?

02:50.371 --> 02:54.245
AND HE KNEW THE BEST WAY
TO KEEP HIS WIFE HAPPY...

02:54.245 --> 02:56.247
JUST... GOOD AT MY JOB.

02:56.247 --> 02:57.848
WELL...

02:57.848 --> 02:59.179
MWAH.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.882
WAS TO LIE.

03:13.264 --> 03:16.797
THERE ARE DANGEROUS WOMEN
IN THIS WORLD--

03:16.797 --> 03:20.731
DEVIOUS PREDATORS
WAITING TO STRIKE.

03:20.731 --> 03:24.735
YOU CAN SPOT THEM
BY THE LIPSTICK THEY USE,

03:24.735 --> 03:27.207
THE SHOES THEY WEAR

03:27.207 --> 03:29.440
AND THE PERFUME THEY CHOOSE.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.684
BUT THE EASIEST WAY
TO SPOT A DANGEROUS WOMAN

03:33.684 --> 03:36.417
IS TO SEE HOW SHE BEHAVES...

03:36.417 --> 03:39.320
I AM ABOUT TO MAKE YOU
SO HAPPY.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.923
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.326
AMY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE LUNCH SPECIALS.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.329
I AM ONLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT ONCE I...

03:51.832 --> 03:55.506
ACTUALLY, YOU DO THEM.
I'M GONNA BE A WHILE.

03:55.506 --> 03:57.738
(brakes squeal)

03:57.738 --> 04:00.441
TOM?
 (car door shuts)

04:02.273 --> 04:04.975
H--LYNETTE, HEY.
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:04.975 --> 04:07.848
SO FUNNY. I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.551
BUT I WAS GONNA
START WITH "WHAT THE HELL?"

04:10.551 --> 04:13.554
YOU REMEMBER ANNE, RIGHT?
ANNE SCHILLING.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.886
KIRBY'S MOM. (chuckles)

04:15.886 --> 04:18.689
WE WERE ROOM PARENTS TOGETHER
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.430
RIGHT.

04:20.430 --> 04:22.963
SO... WHAT THE HELL?

04:22.963 --> 04:25.966
TOM, WHY DON'T WE JUST
SHOW HER?

04:34.044 --> 04:36.046
IT'S FOR MY BAND.

04:36.046 --> 04:38.809
ANNE HAS BEEN HELPING US
FIND A REHEARSAL SPACE.

04:38.809 --> 04:41.412
OH. OH.

04:41.412 --> 04:43.414
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE A REALTOR.

04:43.414 --> 04:46.887
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
IT SEEMS LIKE A WASTE OF MONEY.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.019
BUT I JUST GOT THEM
TO REDUCE THE RENT

04:49.019 --> 04:51.021
AND THROW IN
THE UTILITIES.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.864
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE NOISE

04:53.864 --> 04:56.727
WHEN WE PRACTICE IN THE GARAGE,
SO, YOU KNOW...

04:56.727 --> 04:59.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.931
I THINK...

05:00.931 --> 05:02.633
IT'S GREAT.

05:02.633 --> 05:03.804
YOU DO?

05:03.804 --> 05:04.975
YEAH.
 AH!

05:04.975 --> 05:05.936
(laughs)
 WONDERFUL.

05:05.936 --> 05:07.478
(laughs) YEAH.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.980
LISTEN, I HAVE
TO BE SOMEWHERE BY 10:00,

05:09.980 --> 05:12.483
SO WHY DON'T WE
SIGN A LEASE RIGHT NOW?

05:12.483 --> 05:16.717
WOW! I-I WAS CONVINCED THAT YOU
WOULD THINK IT WAS A DUMB IDEA.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.749
WELL... IT'S A LITTLE DUMB,

05:18.749 --> 05:20.921
BUT COMPARED TO WHAT
I WAS THINKING...

05:20.921 --> 05:23.093
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

05:23.093 --> 05:25.926
WELL, IT'S JUST...

05:27.498 --> 05:29.700
I SAW YOU TWO TOGETHER,
AND I...

05:29.700 --> 05:32.703
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE...
AND SHE LOOKS SO...

05:34.064 --> 05:37.067
FOR GOD SAKES, TOM,
THE WOMAN HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.370
JUST SIGN THE DAMN LEASE.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.345
SO OUT OF NOWHERE, JACKSON SAYS,
"LET'S MOVE IN TOGETHER."

05:45.345 --> 05:47.848
I-I MEAN, OF COURSE
I WAS STUNNED.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.821
AND THEN WHEN I SAID NO,
HE JUST BROKE UP WITH ME.

05:50.821 --> 05:53.824
I MEAN, DOES HE REALLY
EXPECT ME TO BE IN LOVE

05:53.824 --> 05:56.056
AFTER JUST FIVE MONTHS?
THAT'S CRAZY.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.590
YEAH, I GUESS, ALTHOUGH HIS WORK
ON THESE MOLDINGS IS AMAZING.

05:59.590 --> 06:01.962
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO REPAINT THESE, SUZANNE?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.634
IT'S SUSAN.

06:03.634 --> 06:06.637
AND HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET SERIOUS.

06:06.637 --> 06:09.640
WHICH IS WHY I WAS HAPPY.
WE WERE JUST HAVING FUN.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.642
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CALL HIM.

06:11.642 --> 06:13.944
HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS COLOR?
 NOT SO MUCH.

06:13.944 --> 06:15.946
FRANK, HOW CAN I CALL HIM?

06:15.946 --> 06:18.649
HE'S THE ONE
THAT ENDED IT WITH ME.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.712
LOOK,
THE GUY MAKES YOU HAPPY.

06:21.712 --> 06:24.054
HE SAYS HE LOVES YOU.

06:24.054 --> 06:26.056
YOU GONNA LET PRIDE STOP YOU

06:26.056 --> 06:29.760
FROM FINDING OUT
WHERE THIS THING COULD GO?

06:29.760 --> 06:31.061
COME ON.

06:31.061 --> 06:33.594
DON'T BE STUPID.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.596
(sighs)

06:37.528 --> 06:39.530
HOW MUCH AM I PAYING YOU?

06:39.530 --> 06:41.171
$14 AN HOUR.

06:41.171 --> 06:43.904
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.977
NO, MA'AM, IT'S NOT.

06:46.977 --> 06:49.980
(wind chimes tinkling)

06:51.742 --> 06:54.645
CARLOS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

06:54.645 --> 06:57.047
UH, VIRGINIA INSISTED
ON GIVING ME A RIDE.

06:57.047 --> 06:59.149
YOU MUST BE GABRIELLE.

06:59.149 --> 07:01.622
CARLOS HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.093
I'M VIRGINIA HILDEBRAND.

07:03.093 --> 07:06.196
OH!
YOU ARE THE MRS. HILDEBRAND.

07:06.196 --> 07:08.198
WELL, YOU'RE
CARLOS' FAVORITE CLIENT.

07:08.198 --> 07:09.660
OH!

07:09.660 --> 07:11.502
WELL, MINE, ANYWAY. (laughs)

07:11.502 --> 07:14.505
I BOUGHT THIS TOP WITH
THAT CRAZY TIP YOU GAVE HIM.

07:14.505 --> 07:17.007
YOUR CARLOS HAS
HELPED MY BACK PROBLEMS

07:17.007 --> 07:19.009
LIKE NO MASSEUR
I HAVE EVER HAD.

07:19.009 --> 07:21.071
I'M PAIN-FREE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.

07:21.071 --> 07:24.144
OH, THAT'S CARLOS FOR YOU.
MR. MAGIC HANDS.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.847
HE HITS THE OL' SWEET SPOT
EVERY TIME.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.619
OKAY, GABY.

07:28.619 --> 07:30.080
I SHOULD GO NOW,

07:30.080 --> 07:32.923
BUT PROMISE YOU'LL AT LEAST
CONSIDER MY LITTLE PROPOSAL.

07:32.923 --> 07:34.955
WHAT PROPOSAL?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.227
I HATE TO STOP WHEN WE'RE
MAKING SO MUCH PROGRESS,

07:37.227 --> 07:39.930
BUT I NEED TO GO TO EUROPE
FOR TWO MONTHS,

07:39.930 --> 07:41.632
MOSTLY LONDON AND ROME.

07:41.632 --> 07:43.133
I'D BE SO GRATEFUL

07:43.133 --> 07:46.136
IF CARLOS WERE TO ACCOMPANY ME
AS MY PERSONAL MASSEUR.

07:46.136 --> 07:48.499
TWO WHOLE MONTHS?

07:48.499 --> 07:51.642
SEE? I TOLD YOU. IT'S TOO LONG,
AND GABY HAS THE GIRLS AND--

07:51.642 --> 07:53.644
I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

07:53.644 --> 07:56.807
WHICH IS WHY
I'M OFFERING CARLOS $50,000.

07:56.807 --> 07:58.478
$50,000?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.680
PER MONTH.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.683
WELL, PIP-PIP
AND ARRIVEDERCI!

08:02.683 --> 08:04.885
GABY.
 I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO
TO DISCUSS IT.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.888
WELL, UH, WHAT'S TO DISCUSS?
FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY,

08:07.888 --> 08:10.891
YOU CAN LOCK HIM IN A CAGE
AND FEED HIM PEANUTS.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.123
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, CARLOS.
LOVELY MEETING YOU, GABY.

08:15.566 --> 08:18.068
CARLOS, DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT SAYING NO TO THIS!

08:18.068 --> 08:20.070
SHE IS NOT MY ONLY CLIENT.
 (engine starts)

08:20.070 --> 08:22.573
I'LL BE LETTING DOWN
THE REST IF I GO.

08:22.573 --> 08:26.076
MR. BANKS
COULD EVEN FIRE ME.
 OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT MR. BANKS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.078
GABY!
 AND SO WHAT IF HE FIRES YOU?

08:28.078 --> 08:30.080
ONCE VIRGINIA TELLS
ALL OF HER RICH LADY FRIENDS

08:30.080 --> 08:32.042
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID FOR HER,

08:32.042 --> 08:34.544
THEY'LL BE LINING UP
AROUND THE BLOCK.
 (door opens)

08:34.544 --> 08:36.046
GREAT.

08:38.048 --> 08:39.990
(whirring)

08:39.990 --> 08:42.522
(Orson) HEY, GREAT NEWS.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.726
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM
MY OLD FRIEND, PETER HICKEY.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.298
I DON'T RECALL EVER HEARING
THAT NAME BEFORE.

08:48.298 --> 08:51.001
HE'S A FRIEND FROM COLLEGE.
ANYWAY, HE MENTIONED THAT

08:51.001 --> 08:53.303
HIS PARENTS' 50th ANNIVERSARY
WAS NEXT MONTH,

08:53.303 --> 08:57.167
AND I CONVINCED HIM TO LET US
CATER IT. DINNER FOR 80.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.538
80?!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.611
HE SHOOTS, HE SCORES!
(laughs)

09:00.611 --> 09:02.573
ORSON! YOU ARE AMAZING!

09:02.573 --> 09:04.144
OH!

09:04.144 --> 09:06.146
ONE WEEK ON THE JOB,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.078
AND HE'S ALREADY
BRINGING IN HUGE ACCOUNTS.

09:08.078 --> 09:10.080
(chuckles nervously)
THAT'S GREAT.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.124
WELL, BETTER GO MARINATE THOSE
SCALLOPS FOR THE LUNCH TOMORROW.

09:14.124 --> 09:16.687
OH, SCALLOPS? DONE.

09:16.687 --> 09:18.058
DONE?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.761
MM. OH, I ALSO MADE
THE PESTO MAYONNAISE,

09:20.761 --> 09:23.694
AND I PUT THE INDIVIDUAL
COBBLERS IN THEIR RAMEKINS.

09:23.694 --> 09:26.566
OH. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
ALL SET UNTIL THE MORNING THEN.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.569
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF?
 AND DO WHAT?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.172
I DON'T KNOW--READ, RELAX,
GIVE YOURSELF A PEDICURE.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.144
FINE.

09:36.006 --> 09:38.308
WHAT DO YOU BET
I TAKE MY SOCKS OFF

09:38.308 --> 09:41.011
AND SEE ORSON'S
ALREADY DONE IT FOR ME?

09:41.011 --> 09:42.683
(door closes)

09:47.017 --> 09:48.889
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.721
REFRIGERATOR NEEDS CLEANING.

09:50.721 --> 09:52.062
NO, IT DOESN'T.

09:52.062 --> 09:55.265
AND BESIDES, I GAVE YOU
THE DAY OFF. NOW GO HOME.

09:55.265 --> 09:59.169
I'M THINKING ABOUT
MOVING TO MARYLAND.

09:59.169 --> 10:01.131
MARYLAND?

10:01.131 --> 10:03.133
MM-HMM. DYLAN'S THERE
WITH HER HUSBAND,

10:03.133 --> 10:05.135
AND THE BABY'S COMING SOON.

10:05.135 --> 10:08.138
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GO INFLICT MYSELF ON THEM.
 YOU CAN'T JUST UP AND MOVE.

10:08.138 --> 10:11.942
YOU HAVE A LIFE HERE.
 NO, I DON'T.
I HAVE A JOB--PERIOD.

10:11.942 --> 10:15.085
NO KIDS TO RAISE, NO HUSBAND,
NO BOYFRIEND.

10:15.085 --> 10:18.749
MIGHT AS WELL THROW IN THE TOWEL
AND... GO BE A GRANDMA.

10:18.749 --> 10:22.793
KATHERINE, YOU ARE A VIBRANT,
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. YOU--

10:22.793 --> 10:24.795
WHO HASN'T HAD SEX
IN TWO YEARS.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.797
THAT SPELLS "GRANDMA" TO ME.

10:28.659 --> 10:30.330
(chuckles nervously)

10:30.330 --> 10:33.864
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.
JUST LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.866
AND HELP KEEP ME BUSY.

10:35.866 --> 10:37.868
WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT,

10:37.868 --> 10:40.811
THE OVEN COULD USE
A REALLY GOOD SCRUBBING.

10:40.811 --> 10:42.212
BLESS YOU.

10:46.777 --> 10:49.019
KAREN?

10:49.019 --> 10:50.951
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

10:50.951 --> 10:54.124
OH. THOSE MUST'VE
SET YOU BACK A CHUNK.

10:54.124 --> 10:55.826
YES, THEY DID...

10:55.826 --> 10:59.189
NOT THAT YOU DESERVE THEM.

10:59.189 --> 11:01.762
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING MAD.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.134
I'M NOT MAD.

11:04.134 --> 11:05.866
I'M FURIOUS.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.168
NOW WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING,

11:08.168 --> 11:10.871
COMING AT MY HUSBAND
WITH A BASEBALL BAT?

11:10.871 --> 11:13.343
I KNOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY, EDIE.

11:13.343 --> 11:16.346
THE DOCTOR HAD ME ON THESE
NEW MEDS, AND IT MADE ME LOOPY.

11:16.346 --> 11:19.049
I THOUGHT DAVE
WAS MESSING WITH MY HEAD,

11:19.049 --> 11:21.351
AND ALL THE TIME,
IT WAS THE DAMN PILLS.

11:21.351 --> 11:24.254
WELL, I HOPE
YOU STOPPED TAKING THEM.

11:24.254 --> 11:25.956
(sighs) YOU BET.

11:25.956 --> 11:28.158
I HAD TO GET
MY MARBLES BACK. (laughs)
 (chuckles)

11:28.158 --> 11:30.160
UH, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU JUST GOT HERE,

11:30.160 --> 11:32.092
BUT I AM SO SLEEPY AND...

11:32.092 --> 11:35.365
OF COURSE. I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA
CALL MY SISTER

11:41.701 --> 11:44.704
AND SEE IF I CAN
STAY WITH HER FOR A WHILE.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.707
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
BE ON MY OWN JUST YET.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.340
OKAY. THEN I'LL
SEE YOU WHENEVER.

11:50.340 --> 11:54.144
OH, BE SURE AND TELL DAVE
HOW SORRY I AM.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.146
HE WILL BE SO GLAD.

11:56.146 --> 11:58.488
HE'S REALLY FOND OF YOU,
YOU KNOW.

12:06.857 --> 12:08.158
(speed-dials, phone rings)

12:08.158 --> 12:10.861
OH, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

12:10.861 --> 12:12.863
HEY, SIS. IT'S KAREN.

12:12.863 --> 12:15.866
DO ME A FAVOR
AND GET YOUR SORRY ASS OVER TO

12:15.866 --> 12:17.868
FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
A.S.A.P.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.040
I NEED YOU BIG-TIME, KIDDO.

12:28.979 --> 12:30.280
(knock on door)

12:30.280 --> 12:33.053
COME IN.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.355
HI. I'M LOOKING FOR ORSON HODGE.
I'M PETER HICKEY.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.058
OH! YES, OF COURSE.
UH, I'M HIS WIFE BREE.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.060
I'M AFRAID
HE'S OUT RUNNING ERRANDS,

12:40.060 --> 12:42.362
BUT HE'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

12:42.362 --> 12:46.536
OH?
 YES. HE SAID YOU WERE
ROOMMATES BACK IN COLLEGE.

12:46.536 --> 12:49.069
YES, WE WERE.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.971
HAVE A SEAT.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.973
ANYWAY, MY PARENTS'
50th ANNIVERSARY IS COMING UP,

12:52.973 --> 12:55.806
AND I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE THEM
WITH A FAMILY REUNION.

12:55.806 --> 12:58.278
WHAT A THOUGHTFUL SON
YOU ARE.

13:04.254 --> 13:05.385
(chuckles)

13:05.385 --> 13:09.089
SO, UH, HAVE YOU GIVEN
ANY THOUGHT TO THE VENUE?

13:09.089 --> 13:12.092
UH, YES. I HAVE A SUMMER PLACE
UP IN LAKE PLEASANT.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.095
AH, PRETTY SURE THE TERRACE
FITS EIGHT TABLES OF TEN.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.097
MY, THAT'S A NICE LITTLE
TERRACE.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.099
WELL, WE WILL THROW YOU
A PARTY SO SPECIAL

13:19.099 --> 13:22.032
THAT YOU'LL WANT US TO CATER
 YOUR ANNIVERSARY, TOO.

13:22.032 --> 13:24.975
UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT MARRIED.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.277
OH. (chuckles)

13:27.277 --> 13:30.210
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.912
WITH A NEW CLIENT,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.384
WHAT I USUALLY DO
IS DISCUSS POSSIBLE MENUS,

13:34.384 --> 13:37.087
AND THEN I HAVE
MY VERY BEST CHEF

13:37.087 --> 13:38.588
PREPARE A SAMPLE DINNER.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.391
"SAMPLE DINNER"?

13:41.391 --> 13:43.994
WE DON'T DO SAMPLE DINNERS.

13:43.994 --> 13:46.526
BUT THIS IS
ORSON'S COLLEGE ROOMMATE.

13:46.526 --> 13:50.060
AND... (whispers)
HE'S QUITE THE CATCH!

13:50.060 --> 13:51.401
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:51.401 --> 13:54.064
IS THIS A SETUP?
BECAUSE I LOATHE BLIND DATES.

13:54.064 --> 13:56.336
WELL, THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT IT.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.338
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A BUSINESS DINNER.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.410
IT HAS ALL THE POTENTIAL UPSIDE
OF A DATE

14:00.410 --> 14:02.412
WHILE STILL BEING
TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.

14:02.412 --> 14:05.345
FINE.
I WILL COOK FOR THE MAN.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.048
BUT I AM NOT
GOING TO GET DRESSED UP,

14:08.048 --> 14:11.581
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT ON MAKEUP,
AND I AM NOT GOING TO FLIRT.

14:11.581 --> 14:13.583
HE CAME WHILE ORSON WAS OUT.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.256
I LET HIM RECORD A MESSAGE
ON MY PHONE.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.961
Orson,
sorry I missed you, buddy.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.963
Catch you next time, okay?
 (beep)

14:22.963 --> 14:25.265
YOU REALIZE YOU COULD HAVE
JUST LED WITH THIS

14:25.265 --> 14:27.537
AND SAVED US
THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.271
(blows)

14:31.271 --> 14:33.303
(coughs)

14:33.303 --> 14:34.644
JEEZ, ROBERTA!

14:36.907 --> 14:39.549
PUT THAT DAMN THING OUT.
YOU'RE NOT IN A CORNER SALOON.

14:39.549 --> 14:42.152
THEN HOW COME THERE'S BOURBON
IN MY COFFEE?

14:42.152 --> 14:44.154
DO I HAVE TO CALL A NURSE?

14:44.154 --> 14:46.116
FINE. I DROVE 80 MILES
TO SEE YOU, KAREN.

14:46.116 --> 14:49.319
YOU BETTER BE DYING,
OR YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR MY GAS.

14:49.319 --> 14:52.322
I'M NOT DYING, BUT THERE'S
SOMEONE WHO SURE WISHES I WAS.

14:52.322 --> 14:54.494
SON OF A BITCH
LANDED ME IN HERE.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.127
YOU TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM.
I'LL CLEAN HIS DAMN CLOCK.

14:57.127 --> 14:59.299
NO, WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS GUY.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.571
MM.
 HE'S DANGEROUS.

15:01.571 --> 15:04.274
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT THAT BIKER IN FLORIDA

15:04.274 --> 15:06.406
WHO NOW HAS TO PUREE
ALL HIS FOOD.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.639
HMM, NEARLY FORGOT
ABOUT HIM.

15:09.639 --> 15:11.942
THAT WAS A FUN VACATION.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.043
(both laugh)

15:13.043 --> 15:15.045
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED ME
TO DO?

15:15.045 --> 15:17.988
LET ME COME STAY WITH YOU
WHEN I GET OUTTA HERE.

15:17.988 --> 15:19.990
THIS GUY THINKS
I'M OUT OF COMMISSION,

15:19.990 --> 15:21.992
AND I WANT
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

15:21.992 --> 15:23.994
AND YOU CAN HELP ME
DO SOME DIGGING.

15:23.994 --> 15:25.996
YOU STILL WORK FOR
THAT CELL PHONE COMPANY? THE...

15:25.996 --> 15:27.557
TELESHORE. YES, GOD HELP ME.

15:27.557 --> 15:30.961
GOOD. PULL HIS RECORDS
AND SEE WHAT TURNS UP.

15:30.961 --> 15:32.963
THE NAME IS
DAVE WILLIAMS.

15:32.963 --> 15:35.565
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S WITH TELESHORE?
 I WENT THROUGH HIS MAIL.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.410
GOD, YOU REMIND ME OF MOM.

15:42.272 --> 15:44.374
SO WHAT ELSE YOU NEED?

15:44.374 --> 15:47.247
(sighs) COULD YOU
SMUGGLE ME IN A COLD BREWSKI?

15:52.082 --> 15:54.384
BOY, NO ONE KNOWS YOU
LIKE FAMILY.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.086
(fizzes)

16:05.635 --> 16:07.667
JACKSON? IT'S ME.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.169
(knocks on door)

16:09.169 --> 16:13.243
(shower running, door creaks)

16:13.243 --> 16:14.544
HELLO?

16:14.544 --> 16:17.547
(shower continues running)

16:21.281 --> 16:23.283
THAT'LL WORK.

16:36.266 --> 16:38.198
(squeaks)

16:44.674 --> 16:47.307
AAH!

16:47.307 --> 16:51.181
AAH! AAH!

16:51.181 --> 16:52.342
(screams)

16:52.342 --> 16:53.543
(grunts)

16:53.543 --> 16:55.145
(groans)
 (thud)

17:08.498 --> 17:10.430
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.732
I THINK SO.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.204
GOOD. (sighs)

17:15.204 --> 17:17.567
SO WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

17:17.567 --> 17:20.369
DARCY.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

17:20.369 --> 17:22.642
SUSAN, JACKSON'S GIRLFRIEND.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.345
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A GIRLFRIEND

17:25.345 --> 17:28.318
WHEN WE HOOKED UP
AT THE CLUB.
 WELL, WHEN GUYS GO
SLUT-HUNTING,

17:28.318 --> 17:31.321
THEY TEND NOT TO PLAY
THE GIRLFRIEND CARD.

17:31.321 --> 17:34.254
DID YOU JUST CALL ME
A SLUT?!

17:34.254 --> 17:37.257
YOU MET THE GUY TONIGHT.
NOW YOU'RE IN HIS SHOWER.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.259
I'M JUST DOING THE MATH.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.231
GOT THE PIZZA.
OH... CRAP.

17:41.231 --> 17:42.692
SO WE BREAK UP,

17:42.692 --> 17:45.795
AND 15 MINUTES LATER
YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

17:45.795 --> 17:47.797
YOU GOT OVER ME FAST.

17:47.797 --> 17:51.301
I'M SURPRISED IT TOOK
15 MINUTES.
 STAY OUT OF THIS.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.303
SUSAN, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

17:53.303 --> 17:56.246
I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

17:56.246 --> 17:59.349
YOU--YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANT A FUTURE.

17:59.349 --> 18:01.711
WELL, I WAS STARTING
TO CHANGE MY MIND,

18:01.711 --> 18:03.713
AND THEN I SHOW UP

18:03.713 --> 18:07.657
AND FIND 5 FEET OF LIP GLOSS
IN THE SHOWER.

18:07.657 --> 18:10.320
I BROUGHT HOT WINGS.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY.

18:15.365 --> 18:17.367
HI. WHAT'S THAT FOR?

18:17.367 --> 18:20.370
WELL, I WAS GONNA USE IT TO WASH
DOWN A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS

18:20.370 --> 18:22.332
THE NEXT TIME
YOUR HUSBAND'S "BAND"

18:22.332 --> 18:23.703
DEFILED
ANOTHER ROCK CLASSIC.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.705
BUT SINCE YOU GOT THEM
A REHEARSAL SPACE,

18:25.705 --> 18:29.239
I THOUGHT WE COULD
SHARE IT OVER ICE.
 (laughs) COME ON IN.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.283
(Lynette) HEY.
 WE'RE TAKING OFF.

18:33.283 --> 18:35.815
REMEMBER, I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT KIRBY'S HOUSE.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.817
OH, RIGHT. AND, KIRBY,
TELL YOUR MOM THANKS.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.250
THAT PLACE SHE FOUND FOR TOM
IS ALREADY PAYING OFF.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.292
YEAH, SHE SAID SHE WAS
THERE YESTERDAY

18:42.292 --> 18:45.655
AND SAID IT WAS LOOKING
PRETTY COOL.
 SH-SHE WAS THERE? WHY?

18:45.655 --> 18:48.528
SHE WAS JUST DROPPING OFF SOME
OLD FURNITURE FOR MR. SCAVO--

18:48.528 --> 18:50.630
A COUPLE CHAIRS,
LAMP, FUTON.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.262
OH.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.404
WELL, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

18:54.404 --> 18:56.436
OKAY. DRIVE SAFELY.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.308
(Porter) YEAH.

18:58.308 --> 19:00.440
UM... NEAT OR ROCKS?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.572
ROCKS.

19:02.572 --> 19:06.646
SO WHY DOES TOM NEED A BED
IN HIS REHEARSAL SPACE?

19:06.646 --> 19:10.650
NOT A BED--
A FUTON, LIKE A COUCH.
 THAT FOLDS OUT TO A BED.

19:10.650 --> 19:15.225
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
 WELL, IF IT'S JUST A COUCH, WHY
DIDN'T TOM TELL YOU ABOUT IT?

19:15.225 --> 19:18.658
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T?
 I DON'T. DID HE?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.592
NO.

19:22.592 --> 19:25.395
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

19:25.395 --> 19:26.866
GOOD FOR YOU

19:26.866 --> 19:29.369
FOR NOT WORRYING ABOUT
YOUR HUSBAND'S BACHELOR PAD.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.372
YOU ARE NOT THE TEENIEST BIT
PARANOID, AND I SAY BRAVA.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.675
NOW WHY AREN'T WE DRINKING?

19:37.307 --> 19:40.310
(playing blues music)

19:43.553 --> 19:45.555
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
 (laughter)

19:45.555 --> 19:48.418
NOT BAD! I MEAN,
WE WERE REALLY COOKIN' THERE.

19:48.418 --> 19:50.920
TOM, YOU GOT ANY BEER
IN THE FRIDGE?

19:50.920 --> 19:53.493
I GOT NOTHING BUT BEER
IN THE FRIDGE.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.495
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
GO GRAB A COLD ONE.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.727
YOU EARNED IT.
YOU SOUNDED GREAT. (laughs)

19:57.727 --> 20:00.400
OH, DO WE BLOW.
 OH, YEAH.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.901
NOT YOU, THOUGH.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.274
MAN, YOU GOT THE HEART
OF A REAL BLUES GUY.

20:04.274 --> 20:06.976
AH, THAT'S WHAT FIVE YEARS
IN PRISON'LL DO TO YA.

20:06.976 --> 20:09.909
OH, YEAH. I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
STILL...

20:09.909 --> 20:12.312
IT'S FUN, ISN'T IT?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.314
HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.645
YOU KNOW, UH...

20:15.645 --> 20:18.418
I WAS THINKING, MAYBE WE SHOULD
BUMP UP OUR REHEARSAL SCHEDULE,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.291
YOU KNOW, TO START
WORKING THE KINKS OUT.
 AH, TWICE A WEEK'S
ABOUT ALL I CAN HANDLE.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.953
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS?

20:23.953 --> 20:26.356
WELL, LET'S SEE.
MY JOB, MY SON.

20:26.356 --> 20:30.430
UH... ALSO, I JUST...
MET THIS WOMAN.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.502
OH, NO, DUDE,
NOT BLOWING US OFF FOR A GIRL.

20:32.502 --> 20:35.004
(laughs) BUDDY, I JUST STARTED
SEEING HER, ALL RIGHT?

20:35.004 --> 20:36.506
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT

20:36.506 --> 20:39.309
FOR THE WHOLE "GETTING BACK
ON THE HORSE" THING.

20:39.309 --> 20:40.740
RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT
SATURDAY AFTERNOON?

20:40.740 --> 20:44.013
I MEAN, COME ON, MAN.
WE GOTTA DO THIS.

20:44.013 --> 20:47.016
WHY? YOU'RE PUTTING
A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT

20:47.016 --> 20:49.449
INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD
GARAGE BAND.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.951
WHY IS IT
SUCH A BIG DEAL TO YOU?

20:51.951 --> 20:54.354
(stammers)

20:54.354 --> 20:55.385
IT'S NOT. (stammers)

20:55.385 --> 20:58.988
I'M--I'M JUST HAVING
A REAL GOOD TIME. (chuckles)

20:58.988 --> 21:01.631
ALL RIGHT, BOYS!
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:01.631 --> 21:04.564
WE GONNA DRINK BEER OR WE GONNA
PLAY SOME ROCK 'N' ROLL?

21:04.564 --> 21:07.637
(telephone rings)

21:07.637 --> 21:09.268
(ring)

21:09.268 --> 21:10.770
(sighs deeply)
 (beep)

21:10.770 --> 21:12.542
TOM, WHERE ARE YOU?

21:12.542 --> 21:15.405
HEY, BABE, WE JUST REALLY
GOT INTO A GROOVE AT REHEARSAL,

21:15.405 --> 21:17.877
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA PLAY
FOR A COUPLE MORE HOURS.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.449
YEAH?

21:19.449 --> 21:21.751
ANYWAY, I JUST WANNA SAY
DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

21:21.751 --> 21:24.754
AND I WILL, UM, I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

21:24.754 --> 21:26.656
OKAY. BYE.

21:26.656 --> 21:27.987
(beep)

21:27.987 --> 21:30.990
(car doors close,
men laughing)

21:32.662 --> 21:35.525
(speaking indistinctly)

21:38.928 --> 21:41.931
(lasers firing)

21:43.803 --> 21:45.605
OH, MY GOD.

21:47.677 --> 21:49.339
LYNETTE!

21:49.339 --> 21:51.381
(chuckles nervously)

21:51.381 --> 21:54.544
YOU SAID YOU WERE
REHEARSING.

21:54.544 --> 21:56.886
I KNOW. I KNOW. (chuckles)

21:56.886 --> 21:59.889
THE GUYS--THE GUYS LEFT,
AND I JUST FIGURED I'D, UH...

21:59.889 --> 22:01.951
HANG OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT.

22:01.951 --> 22:04.754
WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT
AT HOME?

22:06.826 --> 22:09.058
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

22:09.058 --> 22:11.661
YOU MOVING OUT ON ME?

22:11.661 --> 22:13.963
WHY WOULD I MOVE OUT?

22:13.963 --> 22:16.366
SO YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR AFFAIR--

22:16.366 --> 22:19.338
YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT
FOLLOWS THE SPORTS CAR

22:19.338 --> 22:21.340
AND THE GARAGE BAND

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
AND WANTING
TO QUIT YOUR JOB,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.675
THE FINAL STAGE
OF YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS.

22:25.675 --> 22:28.077
OH, AND THEN...

22:28.077 --> 22:31.751
WHEN I HEAR ANNE SCHILLING
HAS BEEN DROPPING BY--

22:31.751 --> 22:35.455
LYNETTE! SHE HAD A BUNCH OF OLD,
CRAPPY FURNITURE IN HER GARAGE.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.457
I BOUGHT IT FOR 50 BUCKS.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.559
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT...

22:42.462 --> 22:44.093
OKAY...

22:46.065 --> 22:47.737
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,

22:47.737 --> 22:51.070
WHEN WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING ABOUT
THE CAR AND THE ROAD TRIP,

22:51.070 --> 22:52.502
PART... (sighs)

22:52.502 --> 22:55.505
PART OF ME THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
JUST COMPLAINING TO COMPLAIN,

22:55.505 --> 22:57.507
TRYING TO RUIN MY FUN.

22:57.507 --> 23:00.009
BUT IF IT'S AFFECTING YOU
LIKE THIS,

23:00.009 --> 23:02.081
IF IT'S MAKING YOU
ACTUALLY THINK

23:02.081 --> 23:04.113
THAT I WOULD HURT YOU
IN THAT WAY,

23:04.113 --> 23:06.115
I'M DONE WITH ALL OF THIS.

23:06.115 --> 23:08.057
(sighs)

23:08.057 --> 23:09.719
SO YOU'LL COME HOME?

23:09.719 --> 23:11.421
OF COURSE.

23:11.421 --> 23:13.493
(sighs)

23:13.493 --> 23:16.165
(kisses, sighs deeply)

23:22.602 --> 23:25.104
LET ME JUST SQUARE
ALL THIS STUFF AWAY, OKAY?

23:25.104 --> 23:28.107
AND THEN I WILL SEE YOU THERE.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.442
GOOD. (chuckles)

23:36.415 --> 23:38.417
MAYBE WHEN YOU COME HOME,

23:38.417 --> 23:40.720
YOU COULD TEACH ME
 HOW TO PLAY THAT VIDEO GAME.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.421
THAT'D BE GREAT.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.525
OKAY.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.857
(door closes)

24:01.070 --> 24:03.813
(telephone rings)

24:03.813 --> 24:05.815
HEY, CLAY.
IS MR. BANKS AROUND?

24:05.815 --> 24:07.817
UH, HE'S NOT BACK
FROM LUNCH YET. WHAT'S UP?

24:07.817 --> 24:09.819
OH, I NEED
TO SWEET-TALK HIM

24:09.819 --> 24:11.821
INTO GIVING CARLOS
TWO MONTHS OFF.

24:11.821 --> 24:15.224
OH, YOU TWO
GOING AWAY SOMEWHERE?
 NO, JUST CARLOS.

24:15.224 --> 24:17.226
MRS. HILDEBRAND
IS TAKING HIM TO EUROPE

24:17.226 --> 24:19.989
AS HER PERSONAL
MASSAGE THERAPIST.

24:19.989 --> 24:21.831
PERSONAL MASSAGE THERAPIST?

24:21.831 --> 24:24.494
PAYING HIM A FORTUNE.
BUT HE'S WORTH IT.

24:24.494 --> 24:26.696
I MEAN, WHAT HE'S DONE
FOR THAT WOMAN,

24:26.696 --> 24:29.038
NO ONE ELSE
HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO.

24:29.038 --> 24:31.170
SO... HE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?

24:31.170 --> 24:34.674
THEY BOTH DID.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE WOMAN,

24:34.674 --> 24:37.507
LOOKING AT CARLOS,
GUSHING LIKE CRAZY.

24:37.507 --> 24:39.809
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THEM
GOING AWAY TOGETHER?

24:39.809 --> 24:41.811
(laughs)
WHY SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

24:41.811 --> 24:43.482
THE WOMAN'S, LIKE, 60.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.485
IF SHE GETS OFF ON CARLOS'
MAGICAL TOUCH, WHAT DO I CARE?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.658
(laughs) YEAH.
WELL, YOU'RE BROAD-MINDED.

24:48.658 --> 24:50.790
YOU KNOW,
IF MY GIRLFRIEND KNEW

24:50.790 --> 24:53.492
THAT MY MASSAGES WERE
GIVING A WOMAN ORGASMS,

24:53.492 --> 24:56.195
NO MATTER HOW OLD SHE WAS--
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
NOBODY USED THE "O" WORD.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.669
HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT?

24:59.669 --> 25:02.231
NO!
HE'S GIVING HER ORGASMS?!

25:02.231 --> 25:03.933
NAH, NOT DELIBERATELY!

25:03.933 --> 25:07.176
UH, HE SWEARS HE'S ONLY BEEN
DOING HIS STANDARD MASSAGE.

25:07.176 --> 25:10.540
OH, I BET HE DOES!
WHERE IS HE? IS SHE HERE NOW?

25:10.540 --> 25:12.011
OH, NO, NO.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.144
SHE PREFERS HER PLACE, SO SHE'S
BEEN SENDING A CAR FOR HIM.

25:17.887 --> 25:19.889
WHERE? WHERE DOES SHE LIVE?

25:19.889 --> 25:21.220
IT'S THAT BIG HOUSE

25:21.220 --> 25:23.222
ON THE CORNER
OF LAKE AND PINEHURST.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.224
I'M SORRY, GABY.
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

25:25.224 --> 25:29.829
HMM. WELL, WHEN THE TIME COMES,
AN ALIBI WOULD BE NICE.

25:33.202 --> 25:35.264
(sighs) WE NEED TO TALK.

25:35.264 --> 25:36.936
SORRY. BAD TIME.

25:36.936 --> 25:40.009
I HAVE THE MAILMAN
UPSTAIRS IN MY TUB.

25:40.009 --> 25:41.310
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:41.310 --> 25:43.913
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

25:43.913 --> 25:45.244
I DON'T?

25:45.244 --> 25:48.217
I TRY TO COMMIT TO YOU,
AND YOU PUSH ME AWAY.

25:48.217 --> 25:50.219
I TRY TO MOVE ON,
AND I'M A SHALLOW JERK,

25:50.219 --> 25:52.221
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

25:52.221 --> 25:54.223
YEAH, I HAVE
BEEN MARRIED TWICE,

25:54.223 --> 25:56.225
AND BOTH TIMES
THAT'S IMPLODED,

25:56.225 --> 25:58.227
SO REALLY, I FEEL LIKE...
(scoffs)

25:58.227 --> 26:00.289
LOVE IS NOT MY FRIEND.

26:00.289 --> 26:04.033
YOU KNOW, I-I WISH THAT I COULD
SAY IT WAS JUST ROTTEN LUCK,

26:04.033 --> 26:05.735
BUT...

26:05.735 --> 26:08.337
I JUST AM THINKING THAT...

26:08.337 --> 26:10.339
I CAN'T DO THIS.

26:10.339 --> 26:11.671
YOU CAN'T?

26:11.671 --> 26:14.173
I-I NEVER EVEN HAD A REAL
GIRLFRIEND BEFORE I MET YOU.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.675
I DIDN'T WANT ONE.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.678
AND THE FIRST TIME I TRY
TO COMMIT, BAM! I GET SMACKED.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.811
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE WE ARE ANYMORE.

26:21.811 --> 26:23.282
(sighs) WOW.

26:27.056 --> 26:30.219
WE REALLY MESSED THIS UP,
DIDN'T WE?

26:31.861 --> 26:33.993
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.697
WE JUST HAVE
SO MUCH BAGGAGE.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.869
I WISH WE COULD START OVER.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.735
CAN WE START OVER?

26:52.842 --> 26:55.244
(door closes)
 (sighs deeply)

26:58.147 --> 27:00.149
(cell phone rings)

27:00.149 --> 27:02.792
(sighs)

27:02.792 --> 27:06.395
(ring)

27:06.395 --> 27:08.027
(beep)

27:08.027 --> 27:09.999
HELLO?

27:09.999 --> 27:13.663
(man) Hi.
Uh, is Susan Meyer there?

27:16.866 --> 27:18.668
MAY I ASK WHO'S CALLING?

27:18.668 --> 27:20.209
THIS IS JACKSON... BRADDOCK.

27:20.209 --> 27:23.212
UH, WE MET ONCE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ME.

27:23.212 --> 27:25.074
I HAVE BROWN HAIR.

27:25.074 --> 27:27.216
UH, YEAH.
I THINK I REMEMBER YOU.

27:27.216 --> 27:29.879
WELL, ANYWAY,
I THOUGHT WE REALLY CLICKED,

27:29.879 --> 27:32.882
SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT
WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

27:32.882 --> 27:35.124
OKAY.

27:35.124 --> 27:36.255
WHEN?

27:36.255 --> 27:38.057
TOMORROW.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.059
I KNOW THIS GREAT MEXICAN--

27:40.059 --> 27:41.230
(coughs)

27:41.230 --> 27:42.261
FRENCH PLACE.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.063
SOUNDS GREAT.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.065
PICK ME UP AT 7:00.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.266
GREAT.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.138
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

27:49.138 --> 27:51.370
(laughs)

27:52.842 --> 27:55.104
(beep)

28:02.782 --> 28:06.055
MAY I HELP YOU? EXCUSE ME.

28:06.055 --> 28:08.217
I AM GABRIELLE SOLIS.

28:08.217 --> 28:11.791
PERHAPS YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND?
HE "RUBS" YOUR BOSS.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.262
WHERE ARE THEY?

28:13.262 --> 28:17.696
I AM UNDER STRICT INSTRUCTIONS
NOT TO DISTURB MRS. HILDEBRAND.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.999
YOU CAN WAIT HERE.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.330
FINE.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.335
WHEN THE COPS
BUST UP THIS BROTHEL,

28:26.335 --> 28:28.838
I'M GONNA TELL THEM
YOU'RE THE MADAME.

28:28.838 --> 28:30.179
(sighs)

28:35.384 --> 28:37.346
MMM. MMM, YES.

28:37.346 --> 28:40.820
THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.022
YOU SURE
THIS ISN'T TOO ROUGH?

28:43.022 --> 28:45.124
(Virginia moans)
MMM. NO WAY.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.126
GO DEEPER. I CAN TAKE IT.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.829
OHH.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.301
MMM. MMM.

28:55.905 --> 28:59.338
(moaning)

28:59.338 --> 29:01.240
AHH. HOLD ON.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.512
I'VE GOT A CRICK. I...

29:09.378 --> 29:11.380
CARLOS, I JUST REMEMBERED

29:11.380 --> 29:14.323
I HAD AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS CALL
TO MAKE.

29:16.385 --> 29:19.358
COULD YOU GIVE ME THE ROOM
FOR A MINUTE?
 ABSOLUTELY.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.497
(door closes)

29:28.497 --> 29:31.070
MRS. SOLIS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:31.070 --> 29:34.373
I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO,
AND SHAME ON YOU.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.976
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.278
I KNOW ABOUT...
(whispers) THE BIG "O."

29:39.278 --> 29:41.811
OH, DEAR. HE COULD TELL?

29:41.811 --> 29:44.413
I'M BEYOND MORTIFIED.

29:44.413 --> 29:45.915
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN,

29:45.915 --> 29:48.417
BUT I ASSURE YOU
IT WAS ONLY THAT ONE TIME.

29:48.417 --> 29:49.919
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN.

29:49.919 --> 29:51.921
AND IT NEVER WILL,
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK

29:51.921 --> 29:55.394
I'M GONNA LET YOU DRAG CARLOS
OFF TO EUROPE, YOU'RE NUTS.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.396
I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD BE FLATTERED

29:57.396 --> 29:59.798
THAT A WOMAN AS YOUNG
AND BEAUTIFUL AS YOU

29:59.798 --> 30:01.800
SHOULD SEE ME AS A THREAT.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.803
BUT IT WOULD BE A SHAME
TO LET IT END A FRIENDSHIP

30:04.803 --> 30:07.036
THAT'S COME TO MEAN
SO MUCH TO ME.

30:07.036 --> 30:09.038
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

30:09.038 --> 30:12.481
MRS. SOLIS, MY HUSBAND'S GONE.
I'M ESTRANGED FROM MY FAMILY.

30:12.481 --> 30:14.483
IF YOU LIVE WITH LONELINESS
LONG ENOUGH,

30:14.483 --> 30:17.917
IT BECOMES AN ACHE INSIDE YOU--
AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL PAIN.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.349
I THOUGHT I'D LIVE WITH
THAT PAIN THE REST OF MY LIFE.

30:20.349 --> 30:22.351
THEN YOUR HUSBAND HEALED ME.

30:22.351 --> 30:25.224
CAN YOU BLAME ME
FOR BEING GRATEFUL?

30:27.296 --> 30:29.999
NO, BUT I JUST THINK
WE SHOULD END THINGS

30:29.999 --> 30:32.061
BEFORE THEY GET ANY WEIRDER.

30:32.061 --> 30:36.165
CARLOS TELLS ME YOU USED
TO BE A FASHION MODEL.

30:37.306 --> 30:40.009
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PASSION
FOR CLOTHES.

30:40.009 --> 30:42.311
THE REASON
I'M GOING TO EUROPE IS

30:42.311 --> 30:45.114
TO SEE THE COUTURE COLLECTIONS
IN PARIS AND MILAN.

30:45.114 --> 30:46.315
LUCKY YOU.

30:46.315 --> 30:49.979
IT'S NOT SO MUCH FUN
GOING ALONE.

30:49.979 --> 30:52.882
BUT IF I HAD A KNOWLEDGEABLE
COMPANION LIKE YOU

30:52.882 --> 30:54.353
TO BE MY GUIDE...

30:56.285 --> 30:59.058
IN FACT, YOU COULD BE
MY PERSONAL SHOPPER.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.559
(laughs) THAT IS,

31:00.559 --> 31:03.262
IF YOU DON'T MIND
BEING PAID IN DRESSES.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.596
GOSH, THAT'S A...

31:07.596 --> 31:10.169
A HELL OF A SWEET OFFER,

31:10.169 --> 31:13.602
BUT I'VE... GOT THE GIRLS,
AND, UM...

31:13.602 --> 31:15.474
WE'LL BRING THEM ALONG.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.477
THINK WHAT FUN WE'LL HAVE
DRESSING THEM UP.

31:21.350 --> 31:24.353
WHAT THE HELL? YOU'RE NEVER
TOO YOUNG TO SEE PARIS, RIGHT?

31:24.353 --> 31:26.555
I'M SO GLAD! (laughs)

31:26.555 --> 31:30.519
I CAN SEE WE'RE
GOING TO BE GREAT FRIENDS.

31:30.519 --> 31:34.223
CARLOS!
I'M DONE WITH MY CALL.

31:40.069 --> 31:41.130
(mouths word)

31:53.912 --> 31:55.314
(singsongy) HELLO!

31:55.314 --> 31:57.186
MM!

31:57.186 --> 31:59.188
HEY, HON. CHECK THIS OUT.

31:59.188 --> 32:01.490
(normal voice) IF IT'S
THE CAT EATING SPAGHETTI,

32:01.490 --> 32:03.352
I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT.

32:03.352 --> 32:04.653
IT'S OUR BAND LOGO.

32:04.653 --> 32:07.056
WE'RE THINKING OF GETTING
T-SHIRTS MADE UP.

32:07.056 --> 32:09.598
"BLUE ODYSSEY"?
WHO CAME UP WITH THAT?

32:09.598 --> 32:11.600
THIS WAS THE NAME
OF MY BROTHER'S BAND

32:11.600 --> 32:13.602
WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

32:13.602 --> 32:16.305
YOU HAVE A BROTHER?

32:16.305 --> 32:19.068
HAD. HE DIED.

32:21.310 --> 32:24.943
WELL, YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT HIM.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.275
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:29.378 --> 32:32.221
HIS NAME WAS STEVE.

32:32.221 --> 32:34.723
HE WAS A GREAT GUY...

32:34.723 --> 32:39.428
JUST KINDA GOT CAUGHT UP
IN DRUGS AND COULDN'T GET OUT.

32:39.428 --> 32:41.660
HE WENT TO PRISON,
AND WHEN HE WAS THERE,

32:41.660 --> 32:44.433
HE WAS KILLED...
BY ANOTHER INMATE.

32:44.433 --> 32:47.466
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GUY WHO KILLED HIM?

32:47.466 --> 32:50.539
OH, THE COURT RULED IT
SELF-DEFENSE,

32:50.539 --> 32:54.103
SO THE GUY FINISHED HIS TIME,
AND HE GOT OUT.

32:54.103 --> 32:58.477
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE
NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT HIM.

32:58.477 --> 33:02.351
I MEAN, IT MIGHT HELP YOU
TO TALK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.

33:05.354 --> 33:08.257
I HAVE MY OWN WAY
OF DEALING WITH IT.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.362
OH, SORRY I'M LATE.

33:13.362 --> 33:14.993
THAT REHEARSAL WAS AWESOME.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.995
THEY'RE LETTING ME SING
LEAD VOCAL

33:16.995 --> 33:19.498
ON "HOTEL CALIFORNIA."
 OH, THAT'S NICE.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.500
HEY, WAS THERE
A BLUE CONVERTIBLE

33:21.500 --> 33:24.233
PARKED
IN FRONT OF KATHERINE'S?
 YES, THERE WAS. NICE ONE.

33:24.233 --> 33:27.336
MY GOD, HE'S STILL THERE.
 WHO'S STILL THERE?

33:27.336 --> 33:30.339
WELL, KATHERINE'S BEEN LONELY,
SO I SET HER UP WITH A CLIENT,

33:30.339 --> 33:32.711
AND HE'S BEEN THERE
FOR OVER FOUR HOURS,

33:32.711 --> 33:36.085
SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING WELL!
 GOOD FOR YOU!
MY CLEVER LITTLE MATCHMAKER.

33:36.085 --> 33:39.017
MMM.
 OHH. MWAH. WELL,
YOU DESERVE SOME CREDIT, TOO.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.019
I MEAN, YOU BROUGHT US
PETER'S BUSINESS.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.452
PETER? PETER HICKEY?

33:43.452 --> 33:45.023
YES.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.496
YOU SET HIM UP
WITH KATHERINE?
 IS THAT BAD?

33:47.496 --> 33:49.158
POTENTIALLY.

33:49.158 --> 33:50.499
IS HE GAY?

33:50.499 --> 33:53.502
UGH! I KNEW HE HAD
TOO MUCH PRODUCT IN HIS HAIR.

33:53.502 --> 33:56.505
NO, IT'S JUST THAT WHEN
I BOOKED THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY,

33:56.505 --> 33:59.208
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND PETER,

33:59.208 --> 34:02.411
SO I SAID WE'D MET IN COLLEGE,
WHICH IS NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE.

34:02.411 --> 34:06.075
WELL, WHERE DID YOU MEET?
 PRISON.

34:06.075 --> 34:08.717
PETER'S A FELON?

34:08.717 --> 34:11.280
BUT HE'S SO REFINED,
SO HANDSOME.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.782
TWO QUALITIES THAT DID NOT
SERVE HIM WELL BEHIND BARS.

34:13.782 --> 34:15.784
MY GOD, ORSON.
WHAT KIND OF CRIMINAL IS HE?

34:15.784 --> 34:19.388
A KILLER OR A RAPIST?
 OH, NO, NO, NO,
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

34:19.388 --> 34:21.389
THEY GOT HIM
FOR ORGAN TRAFFICKING.

34:21.389 --> 34:22.460
WHAT?!

34:22.460 --> 34:24.463
HE WAS A SURGEON,
AND IT SEEMS

34:24.463 --> 34:26.435
THAT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTED ITSELF,

34:26.435 --> 34:28.437
HE'D HARVEST
THE ODD LIVER OR KIDNEY

34:28.437 --> 34:30.139
FROM A DECEASED PATIENT

34:30.139 --> 34:33.141
AND THEN SELL IT
ON THE BLACK MARKET.
 ARE YOU TELLING ME

34:33.141 --> 34:36.445
THAT I SET KATHERINE UP
WITH A CONVICTED GRAVEROBBER?!
 WELL, YOU SAID YOURSELF,

34:36.445 --> 34:38.476
WOMEN OVER 40
CAN ONLY BE SO CHOOSY.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.650
THAT IS NOT FUNNY!
I HAVE TO GO WARN KATHERINE.

34:44.612 --> 34:46.784
(beeping)

34:46.784 --> 34:48.786
(phone rings)
 (Katherine whispering)
Hello?

34:48.786 --> 34:50.489
KATHERINE, HI!

34:50.489 --> 34:52.491
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
OVER THERE?

34:52.491 --> 34:54.422
Yes, everything's fine.

34:54.422 --> 34:56.425
THEN WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

35:00.169 --> 35:03.232
PETER JUST FELL ASLEEP.
I DON'T WANT TO WAKE HIM.

35:03.232 --> 35:04.873
OH, MY GOD.

35:04.873 --> 35:07.836
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM?

35:07.836 --> 35:10.539
YOU CAN WAG THAT FINGER
ALL YOU LIKE.

35:10.539 --> 35:14.883
I'VE GOT JUST SIX WORDS
FOR YOU, BREE HODGE...

35:14.883 --> 35:16.885
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU!

35:16.885 --> 35:20.449
OH, I JUST REALLY WISH
YOU'D TAKEN THINGS MORE SLOWLY.

35:20.449 --> 35:23.452
BREE, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
THE MOST MAGICAL NIGHT I'VE HAD

35:23.452 --> 35:25.454
SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHEN.

35:25.454 --> 35:28.457
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE ME
FEEL BAD ABOUT IT NOW?

35:28.457 --> 35:30.699
NO, I'M NOT.

35:30.699 --> 35:34.533
OH! HE IS JUST SO WONDERFUL.

35:34.533 --> 35:38.407
I TELL YOU, IF I'M NOT CAREFUL,
THIS GUY COULD STEAL MY HEART.

35:38.407 --> 35:42.371
WELL, IF HE TRIES,
JUST PROMISE YOU'LL CALL.

35:42.371 --> 35:43.672
(beep, phone hits table)

35:43.672 --> 35:44.843
(mouths word)

35:50.779 --> 35:52.481
(ice rattling, door opens)

35:52.481 --> 35:54.583
SORRY I'M LATE.
 (door closes)

35:54.583 --> 35:56.585
I WAS SLEEPING SO SOUNDLY.

35:56.585 --> 35:58.727
PETER DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE ME. (giggles)

35:58.727 --> 36:00.629
WHAT'S THIS?

36:00.629 --> 36:03.832
A COSMOPOLITAN.
THAT'S YOUR FAVORITE, ISN'T IT?

36:03.832 --> 36:06.335
IT'S 10:00 A.M.
I DON'T WANT A DRINK.

36:06.335 --> 36:09.298
(sighs) YOU WILL.

36:09.298 --> 36:11.640
(crying)

36:11.640 --> 36:15.804
BUT... THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE
WHOSE KIDNEYS HE BOUGHT--

36:15.804 --> 36:19.448
HE AT LEAST PAID THEM WELL,
RIGHT?

36:19.448 --> 36:22.651
OH, I AM SO, SO SORRY.

36:22.651 --> 36:25.354
OH, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

36:25.354 --> 36:27.656
I HAVE NO ONE BUT MYSELF
TO BLAME.

36:27.656 --> 36:29.488
(cries and sighs)

36:29.488 --> 36:31.460
THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING TO MARYLAND.

36:31.460 --> 36:34.763
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE
BECAUSE OF ONE BAD DATE.

36:34.763 --> 36:37.195
YOU DON'T GET IT.

36:37.195 --> 36:41.500
WHEN WE STARTED THIS, YOU WERE
JUST AS LONELY AS I WAS--

36:41.500 --> 36:43.532
ORSON IN JAIL, BENJY GONE.

36:43.532 --> 36:45.534
AND I FELT BAD FOR YOU,

36:45.534 --> 36:48.537
BUT, BOY, WAS IT NICE TO HAVE
SOMEBODY IN THE SAME BOAT.

36:48.537 --> 36:52.781
AND THEN ORSON GOT OUT,
AND NOW HE'S HERE ALL THE TIME.

36:52.781 --> 36:54.883
AND I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE THIS...

36:54.883 --> 36:58.617
FUN, HAPPY POWER COUPLE,

36:58.617 --> 37:02.691
AND I'M JUST THIS NEEDY,
PATHETIC IDIOT...

37:02.691 --> 37:04.693
(crying) WHO HOPS INTO BED

37:04.693 --> 37:09.498
WITH THE FIRST PANCREAS THIEF
WHO KISSES HER.

37:09.498 --> 37:13.262
(sobbing)

37:14.703 --> 37:16.705
I SHOULD BE WITH FAMILY.

37:16.705 --> 37:18.507
AND I'M NOT FAMILY?

37:20.969 --> 37:26.445
KATHERINE, ALL MY LIFE,
I WANTED A SISTER.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.917
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE
I FINALLY HAVE ONE.

37:28.917 --> 37:33.722
BUT WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING
AND COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER.

37:33.722 --> 37:37.586
WELL, WHAT COULD BE
MORE SISTERLY THAN THAT?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.630
I KNOW I'M NOT THE MOST...

37:43.462 --> 37:47.536
DEMONSTRATIVE... PERSON,
BUT I CARE ABOUT YOU DEEPLY,

37:47.536 --> 37:50.869
AND IF YOU WERE
TO JUST WALK OUT OF MY LIFE,

37:50.869 --> 37:53.572
I WOULD BE VERY...

37:53.572 --> 37:55.474
VERY UNHAPPY.

37:57.506 --> 37:59.578
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT THAT.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.311
GOOD.

38:02.311 --> 38:05.584
(both laugh)

38:05.584 --> 38:08.657
WELL,
NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED...
 (claps hands)

38:08.657 --> 38:10.889
LET'S MAKE SOME PIES.
 OKAY.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.492
(sniffles)

38:13.492 --> 38:15.063
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER COSMO?

38:15.063 --> 38:17.025
NO.

38:19.928 --> 38:22.501
HEY, IS PORTER
STILL AT KIRBY'S?

38:22.501 --> 38:23.632
YEAH.

38:23.632 --> 38:26.475
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU'VE BEEN ANTSY ALL NIGHT.

38:26.475 --> 38:29.007
NOTHING. NO, I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

38:29.007 --> 38:32.341
(door closes)

38:32.341 --> 38:34.583
OKAY, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

38:34.583 --> 38:37.586
I HAVE HAD THIS NAGGING FEELING
THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING,

38:37.586 --> 38:39.588
AND THEN I JUST REALIZED

38:39.588 --> 38:42.651
I THINK I LEFT THE FREEZER DOOR
AT SCAVO'S OPEN.
 YOU SURE?

38:42.651 --> 38:46.455
NO. THAT'S WHY IT'S GONNA
DRIVE ME CRAZY. (laughs)

38:46.455 --> 38:48.757
I BETTER GO DOWN THERE
AND CHECK. MMM.

38:48.757 --> 38:50.098
OKAY.

38:50.098 --> 38:51.530
HURRY BACK.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.443
I'M SO GLAD YOU WERE ABLE
TO GET AWAY.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.515
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D MAKE IT.

39:06.515 --> 39:08.517
YEAH.

39:08.517 --> 39:11.650
I'M GLAD MY PARENTS STILL THINK
I'M YOUNG ENOUGH FOR SLEEPOVERS.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.652
(car door shuts)

39:16.655 --> 39:19.357
CRAP! IT'S MY DAD!

39:24.362 --> 39:25.664
(door slams)

39:25.664 --> 39:28.467
DAD, HI.
I WAS JUST--I WAS JUST...

39:28.467 --> 39:31.099
I KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE "JUST."

39:32.941 --> 39:35.874
WHEN I FOUND THIS,
I THOUGHT,

39:35.874 --> 39:37.576
OH, GREAT!

39:37.576 --> 39:40.579
ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE BAND
IS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.911
AND THEN IT HIT ME--
PORTER HAS A KEY.

39:44.713 --> 39:46.555
WHERE IS SHE?

39:46.555 --> 39:47.916
(mouths words)

39:47.916 --> 39:49.518
OH.
 DAD.

39:49.518 --> 39:50.989
DON'T.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.722
SHE ISN'T WEARING ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT?

39:53.722 --> 39:55.524
WHO IS SHE?

39:55.524 --> 39:57.526
JUST SOME GIRL
FROM ENGLISH CLASS.

39:57.526 --> 39:59.097
YOU--YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.099
I'M GONNA
GO IN THE BATHROOM.

40:01.099 --> 40:04.102
YOU GOT 60 SECONDS
TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.

40:05.874 --> 40:08.777
(exhales deeply)

40:19.518 --> 40:21.620
(shifts gears)

40:27.496 --> 40:29.498
OH. HEY, MIKE.

40:29.498 --> 40:32.430
WOW. LOOK AT YOU
ALL DRESSED UP.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.203
(chuckles) OH, I WAS, UM,
KIND OF ON A DATE.

40:35.203 --> 40:37.966
OH. HOW DID IT GO?

40:37.966 --> 40:39.508
PRETTY BAD.

40:39.508 --> 40:41.810
BASICALLY, SHE JUST GRILLED ME
ALL THROUGH DINNER--

40:41.810 --> 40:44.773
WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT THIS?
WHAT WOULD I DO IF THAT?

40:44.773 --> 40:46.475
I BARELY EVEN KNOW HER.

40:46.475 --> 40:49.478
I FELT LIKE I WAS
ON TRIAL FOR MY LIFE.
 OH, I'M SORRY.

40:49.478 --> 40:52.481
I JUST WANTED SOMEBODY NICE
TO HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE WITH.

40:52.481 --> 40:54.953
I GUESS
THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.886
WELL, IT'S KINDA LATE
FOR COFFEE, BUT...

40:57.886 --> 40:59.888
I DO HAVE LEMONADE.

40:59.888 --> 41:01.690
I'D SETTLE FOR LEMONADE.

41:09.738 --> 41:11.600
HEY, YOU KNOW,

41:11.600 --> 41:14.603
I KNOW IT SEEMS
LIKE I AM BEING HARD ON YOU,

41:14.603 --> 41:16.605
BUT LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

41:16.605 --> 41:17.946
I DON'T THINK

41:17.946 --> 41:20.148
THAT YOU'RE
EMOTIONALLY READY FOR SEX.

41:20.148 --> 41:22.581
I KNOW. YOU SAID.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.613
JUST MAKING SURE
YOU HEARD ME.

41:24.613 --> 41:26.014
MM-HMM.

41:26.014 --> 41:27.686
NOW GO TO BED.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.017
(chuckles)

41:29.017 --> 41:30.559
IT'S LATE.

41:30.559 --> 41:31.620
MM.

41:34.663 --> 41:36.494
WANT ME TO, UH,

41:36.494 --> 41:38.797
PUT THE CAR COVER ON
FOR YOU FIRST?

41:38.797 --> 41:41.499
SURE. THANKS.
 (key jingle)

41:41.499 --> 41:42.701
(Tom sighs)

41:42.701 --> 41:46.034
(front door closes)

41:54.212 --> 41:56.815
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. SOMEONE
MIGHT RECOGNIZE YOUR CAR.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.687
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

41:58.687 --> 42:01.289
YEAH. MY DAD
DOESN'T SUSPECT ANYTHING.

42:01.289 --> 42:04.052
I'M SORRY IF
I GOT YOU IN ANY TROUBLE.

42:04.052 --> 42:07.556
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE WORTH IT.

42:09.558 --> 42:12.530
THERE ARE DANGEROUS WOMEN
IN THIS WORLD.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.603
SOME ARE LOVERS,

42:14.603 --> 42:18.707
BLIND TO THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THEIR ACTIONS.

42:18.707 --> 42:20.609
(door opens)

42:20.609 --> 42:23.742
SOME ARE WIVES
ENRAGED BY THE BETRAYAL

42:23.742 --> 42:26.244
OF THOSE THEY TRUSTED.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.246
(zips up bags)

42:30.218 --> 42:32.550
OTHERS ARE PREDATORS,

42:32.550 --> 42:36.725
DEVIOUSLY SETTING TRAPS
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.

42:39.788 --> 42:42.290
IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY ENOUGH
TO COME UPON

42:42.290 --> 42:45.093
ONE OF THESE
DANGEROUS CREATURES,

42:45.093 --> 42:47.866
THE SAFEST THING TO DO...

42:47.866 --> 42:50.198
I PULLED THOSE RECORDS
YOU ASKED FOR.

42:50.198 --> 42:53.201
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MR. WILLIAMS
IS KEEPING A LITTLE SECRET.

42:53.201 --> 42:56.074
IS RUN THE OTHER WAY.
