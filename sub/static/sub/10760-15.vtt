how great you were tonight.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.000
Well, thanks, Dad,
but I wasn't great.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.000
I just walked out on the court

12:24.300 --> 12:25.900
and heaved the ball
as hard as I could,

12:26.200 --> 12:27.300
and the rest was just luck.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.400
That may be so, Niles, but still and all,
you did go down and do it.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.300
Not many people
could have done that.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.400
I know I always told you boys
that sports aren't important,

12:35.700 --> 12:37.700
but they are.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.300
And what you did tonight out there
makes me really proud.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.700
Thanks.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.700
Good thing I wangled those tickets,
hey, Dad?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.500
Oh, look, Niles is on TV!

12:48.800 --> 12:51.200
I can't believe it.
You made Play of the Week.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.300
We got us a real live celebrity
in our own home.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
It's up and it's good!

13:05.000 --> 13:08.400
NILES: Excuse me.
Nonfat latte to go, please.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.900
Hey, Frasier, mind if I join you?

13:14.400 --> 13:18.100
Are you sure?
The jocks usually sit over at that table.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.100
This thing?

13:20.400 --> 13:24.000
Yes, this was just part
of a gift package the Sonics sent over.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.500
I just didn't wanna seem ungrateful.
Not that I owe them anything.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.600
After all, I'm the one
that drained it from way downtown.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.900
Yes, so we've been hearing.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.400
NILES:
Frasier, don't grouse.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.300
I've earmarked
a pair of practise pants for you.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.300
Thank you, Niles, but I like to think
I've already mastered pants.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.300
I assume you're gonna select

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
a more appropriate jacket
for this evening's concert.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.100
Yeah, about that, Dad wants me
to go with him to McGinty's,

13:52.400 --> 13:53.900
so he can have me tell the tale.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.100
But we've already
rescheduled the concert once.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.600
That was because of you.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.800
It was not because of me,
it was because of Dad.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.500
- So is McGinty's.
- Well, it's not the same.

14:02.900 --> 14:03.900
We had an agreement.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.000
If you should choose to dishonour it,
there will be consequences.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.300
Why don't we compromise?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.300
Let's say we go and have
a drink with Dad at McGinty's,

14:12.600 --> 14:14.900
and then afterwards
proceed on to the concert?

14:15.200 --> 14:17.100
Well, I just don't...
I don't... Well, l...

14:17.400 --> 14:19.100
All right, fine.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.800
- Thank you. I'll see you later, Frasier.
- Yes.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.000
Wow, Niles.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.600
Finally made varsity
after 30 years, huh?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.200
Yes, but it's not
a real varsity jacket, Roz,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.200
so you're under no obligation
to sleep with me.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.600
- See you around.
- Take care.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.200
Hi, Frasier.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.100
You may join me if you wish, Roz.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.000
Be forewarned,
I'm feeling a bit peevish.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.700
For God's sake,
you're like Goldilocks with that latte.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.200
This foam is too hard,
this foam is too soft.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.600
No, this is not about
latte foam, Roz.

14:57.900 --> 15:01.000
And since Niles made that basket, his
head's been getting bigger and bigger.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.600
You have to admit
it was pretty amazing.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.300
Amazingly lucky.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.100
But to hear Niles tell it:

15:08.400 --> 15:12.400
It all started
in a little rubber factory in Sumatra,

15:14.200 --> 15:16.500
where an unsuspecting basketball
began a journey

15:16.700 --> 15:18.900
that would lead to greatness.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.900
So he's milking it a little bit.
You would do the same thing.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.200
I would not.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.400
I would treat it
as the chance occurrence it was.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.500
Like finding a terrific parking spot
in front of the opera house.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.900
- You bragged about that for weeks.
- It was right in front of the steps, Roz.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.300
You know what I mean, Frasier.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.500
Yes, I suppose I do.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.400
Guess I'll just have to grin
and bear it for a little while longer.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.000
ROZ:
Here's Jean-Pierre.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.800
Oh, your French beau.
How's that going?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.500
- I'm breaking up with him.
- I'm sorry.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
- Actually, you're going to do it for me.
- What?

15:50.300 --> 15:52.700
Since I don't speak French,
I need you to translate, please.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.800
For God's sake... Well, all right.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.000
We're having coffee. Sit down.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.200
I can't imagine
why this isn't working.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.000
Jean-Pierre, this is Frasier.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
[IN FRENCH]

16:10.200 --> 16:11.500
ROZ:
Now, I wanna do this gently,

16:11.800 --> 16:14.000
so will you tell him
that I think he's a really nice guy?

16:14.300 --> 16:15.200
Uh-huh.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.600
[IN FRENCH]

16:25.400 --> 16:26.500
- What did he say?
- Um...

16:26.600 --> 16:29.900
He says
that he's very fond of you too.

16:30.600 --> 16:35.700
Okay. Now tell him that these past
few weeks have been really fun.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.500
You can go faster, Roz.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.300
Let me do this my way. Tell him.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.700
He says,
"What are you trying to say?"

17:01.000 --> 17:02.200
Okay.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.500
Tell him that another time,

17:04.800 --> 17:08.800
another place,
we might have a shot.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
But this just isn't working for me.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.500
Is there any chance
you would reconsider?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.600
- I don't think so.
- Uh-huh.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.900
- Is he okay?
- Yes, Roz, he'll be fine.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.000
But, you know, for his sake I think
we should wrap this up, all right?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.100
- Jean-Pierre...
- Roz.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.100
- He says that he'll...
- Please, Frasier.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.500
Some things
don't need to be translated.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.000
So at this point,
what were you thinking?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.200
Stop tape, please.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
I'd have been thinking
about that sweet truck.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.500
BARTENDER: Yeah, me too.
- Not me.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.100
If you're focusing on the reward,

18:21.400 --> 18:24.300
that's energy you're not using
to make the shot.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.100
MARTIN:
You know what else?

18:26.300 --> 18:28.100
He's donating that truck
to the Police Activities League.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.400
[PATRONS APPLAUDING]

18:29.600 --> 18:32.800
I just want the kids to know
it's about the playoffs, not the payoffs.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.000
Is this a great boy or what?

18:36.300 --> 18:38.100
You sure I can't pay you
for this beer?

18:38.400 --> 18:39.400
Your money's no good here.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.800
Half-court Crane's dad
doesn't pay for drinks.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.800
Excuse me, Niles,
but we have a concert to make.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.400
I know, soon. I can't leave
the fellas hanging, Frasier.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.900
All right, back to the tape.

18:50.200 --> 18:54.200
All right, now,
that's about 45 feet to that basket.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.900
You see, I used my whole body.
Form is everything.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.700
You've already made
or missed the shot

19:02.000 --> 19:04.600
even before you release the ball.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.100
And, of course,
we all know the rest of the story.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
Yes, yes.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.200
The story is:

19:10.400 --> 19:13.200
Once upon a time, Niles Crane
accidentally made a basket.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.400
The end!

19:17.100 --> 19:18.800
I don't deny
there was some luck involved,

19:18.900 --> 19:22.800
but as we all know,
luck is the residue of design.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.500
Please. Somehow managing to hurl
a ball forward is hardly design.

19:27.900 --> 19:32.500
You're just jealous
because I have game and you don't.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.300
Oh, please.
So you think you have game?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.800
- I do have game.
- Do you think they're gonna fight?

19:39.200 --> 19:41.400
I got news for you, they are fighting.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.600
We'll just see about that. Barkeep.

19:43.900 --> 19:44.900
What are you doing?

19:45.200 --> 19:48.300
I'm gonna challenge Niles to a game of
one-on-one on that contraption there.

19:48.700 --> 19:49.900
What do you wanna do that for?

19:50.100 --> 19:51.900
Twenty dollars
of your cleanest quarters.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.200
What about your concert?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.000
You guys better get moving.
Tick, tock.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.500
All right, Frasier, game on.

19:59.600 --> 20:04.100
Wait, it's not worth it.
Sports aren't everything.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.400
All right, hotshot, after you.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.600
Let's go half court. Put it up, baby.

20:10.900 --> 20:11.900
Thank you, thank you.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.700
I appreciate the support, but I think
I might throw better with fewer voices.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Well, obviously I'm accustomed
to shooting from further back.

20:28.300 --> 20:31.700
Yes, and just once. Allow me.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.300
All right, all right, your turn.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.500
All right.
I believe I'm warmed up now.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.900
Yeah, I hit the round part
and that's worth a half a point.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.200
- I think I could use another beer.
- That will be 2.95.
