00:02.673 --> 00:05.536
(Meredith) THE FIRST 24 HOURS
AFTER SURGERY ARE CRITICAL.

00:05.536 --> 00:08.509
EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE,
EVERY FLUID YOU MAKE

00:08.509 --> 00:11.212
IS METICULOUSLY RECORDED
AND ANALYZED...

00:11.212 --> 00:13.214

THE NEXT 24 HOURS?

00:15.286 --> 00:18.289
SO YOU AND CRISTINA
ARE GOING FISHING?

00:18.289 --> 00:20.651
WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?

00:20.651 --> 00:22.653
OWEN'S CONCERNED ABOUT
LEAVING CRISTINA ALONE,

00:22.653 --> 00:24.695
SO WHEN I TOLD HIM
I WAS GOING FISHING...

00:24.695 --> 00:28.659
RIGHT, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO CRISTINA?

00:28.659 --> 00:30.801
ACTUALLY, I HAVE.

00:30.801 --> 00:33.304
YOU SPOKE TO HER? WHEN?

00:33.304 --> 00:36.267
I CALLED HER LAST NIGHT.
WELL, SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
DRUNK OR SOMETHING,

00:36.267 --> 00:38.539
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T DO
THE WILDERNESS.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.442
I MEAN, THERE AREN'T EVEN
ANY BATHROOMS IN THE WILDERNESS.
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HER,

00:41.442 --> 00:43.444
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE

00:43.444 --> 00:45.446
WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

IS YOUR BIG PLAN

00:48.048 --> 00:50.321

WE'RE NOT TRYING

00:50.321 --> 00:52.723

SHE'S OKAY.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.253
UGH!
OHH.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.925
LAPS! LAPS!

09:14.925 --> 09:17.087
(gushes)

09:25.295 --> 09:27.698
GREY, I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
I'M SUCTIONING.

09:27.698 --> 09:30.671
SUCTION'S TOO SLOW.
USE YOUR HANDS. ANOTHER SUCTION.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.773
HOW'S HIS PRESSURE?
(man) 79 OVER 40.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.305
HE'S LIKE A BUCKET
FULL OF HOLES.

09:35.305 --> 09:37.577
I'M GONNA OCCLUDE THE AORTA
AT THE HIATUS

09:37.577 --> 09:39.650
TILL WE CAN GET
HIS PRESSURE BACK UP.

09:39.650 --> 09:42.753
HOW MANY UNITS HAS HE GOTTEN?
THREE UNITS OF O-NEG, ONE UNIT
A-POSITIVE TYPE SPECIFIC,

09:42.753 --> 09:44.755
AND ONE UNIT OF F.F.P.
OKAY. LET'S GET
SOME MORE PACKS IN THERE.

09:44.755 --> 09:46.787
LET'S TRY AND ISOLATE THIS
BLEEDER UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT

09:46.787 --> 09:50.290
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. LAPS.
MORE. KEEP 'EM COMING. MORE.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.063
MORE. QUICKLY. FASTER. I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE TO KEEP ASKING.

09:53.063 --> 09:56.066
(birds chirping)

09:58.899 --> 10:00.771
CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION?

10:00.771 --> 10:01.902
YEAH.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.135
IF YOU MOUNT
THE ROD HOLDERS MID-SHIP,

10:05.135 --> 10:08.378
WE CAN BOTH REACH THE RODS
FROM EITHER END OF THE BOAT.

10:08.378 --> 10:10.981
AFTER YOU CALLED LAST NIGHT,
I DID SOME RESEARCH.

10:10.981 --> 10:13.383
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
ANYTHING LESS THAN SEAWORTHY.

10:13.383 --> 10:14.985
WELL, IT'S A LAKE.

10:14.985 --> 10:16.146
STILL.

10:16.146 --> 10:19.249
UH, ACTUALLY, IT'S, UH...

10:19.249 --> 10:21.121
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.854
YOU MAY NEED CLIP-ON MOUNTS
TO CLEAR THE GUNWALES.

10:23.854 --> 10:26.757
ARE YOU GONNA BE LIKE THIS
ALL DAY?

10:26.757 --> 10:28.729
I CAN'T HELP IT.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.003
I'VE TRIED TO AVOID
GETTING A NEW HIP

10:33.003 --> 10:36.106
BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH THE RECOVERY, BUT--

10:36.106 --> 10:40.040
THERE'S NO CARTILAGE LEFT,
BONE SPURS.
OUR DAUGHTER'S
AN ORTHODONTIST IN SARASOTA.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.371
HMM.
SHEILA.

10:41.371 --> 10:43.373
WHAT? THEY SHOULD KNOW
THAT WE HAVE

10:43.373 --> 10:45.215
MEDICAL PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY.

10:45.215 --> 10:47.147
WE'RE NOT JUST NOBODIES
OFF THE STREET. (chuckles)

10:47.147 --> 10:50.180
MR. CHERKOVSKY,
CLEARLY YOU NEED A NEW HIP.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.723
NOW I'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
WITH A NEW,

10:52.723 --> 10:54.985
MINIMALLY INVASIVE TECHNIQUE.
DR. KAREV.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.987
WELL, SHE'D USE
COMPUTER GUIDANCE

10:56.987 --> 10:58.989
TO AVOID ANY EXCESS RADIATION.

10:58.989 --> 11:01.992
AND SHE'D MAKE A SMALL INCISION
ALONG THE MUSCLE...
(clicks keyboard keys)

11:01.992 --> 11:04.865
SO WE WOULD AVOID
DAMAGING THE HIP MUSCLE.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.798
NOW I CAN FIT YOU IN
THIS AFTERNOON AT 2:00 P.M.

11:07.798 --> 11:10.200
AND HAVE YOU WALKING OUT OF HERE
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.003
WHY DOES SHE HAVE AN OPENING?
WHY ISN'T SHE BUSIER?

11:13.003 --> 11:16.206
WHAT MY WIFE WANTS TO KNOW--
I-I HEARD HER. I'M--
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

11:16.206 --> 11:19.079
UM, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
COMING OFF OF SOME LEAVE,

11:19.079 --> 11:21.451
AND SO MY SCHEDULE'S FLEXIBLE.

11:21.451 --> 11:24.454
BUT, UH, I'M THE ONLY SURGEON
IN THE NORTHWEST

11:24.454 --> 11:26.957
DOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE
HIP REPLACEMENTS.

11:26.957 --> 11:29.219
ASK HER WHY NO ELSE
IS DOING IT IF IT'S SO GREAT.

11:29.219 --> 11:31.461
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T,
AND SHE CAN.

11:31.461 --> 11:33.794
TELL THEM YOU WANT
A SECOND OPINION.
SHEILA--

11:33.794 --> 11:35.826
NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY, YOUR WIFE'S RIGHT.

11:35.826 --> 11:38.098
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA
TO GET ANOTHER OPINION.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.100
CALL DAN MILLER

11:40.100 --> 11:42.102
AND SEE IF HE CAN
SQUEEZE THEM IN RIGHT NOW.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.104
MAYBE I SHOULD MENTION

11:44.104 --> 11:47.237
THAT THEIR DAUGHTER
IS AN ORTHODONTIST.
YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA MEET
WITH MILLER,

11:47.237 --> 11:49.239
HEAR ABOUT
HIS 6-WEEK RECOVERY PERIOD,

11:49.239 --> 11:51.842
AND COMING RUNNING BACK.
KEEP MY 2:00 P.M. SLOT OPEN.

11:51.842 --> 11:54.084
WE'RE GONNA BE REPLACING
RON'S HIP.

11:54.084 --> 11:55.485
HEY, MORNING, ELI.
HEY.

11:55.485 --> 11:57.487

MR. RABB'S SAMPLE

11:57.487 --> 12:00.090

TO THE LAB YET?
NOT YET.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.893
UH, I ASKED FOR IT
OVER AN HOUR AGO.
YEAH, I WAS LETTING HIM REST.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.895
HE DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH
LAST NIGHT.

12:04.895 --> 12:07.397

CHECK OUT MRS. KAY.

12:13.804 --> 12:16.206

I'M TIRED.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.210

TERRIBLE.

12:20.210 --> 12:22.212
OKAY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
THAT SHOWS

ARE SLEEPING OR--OR EATING--

18:14.093 --> 18:16.566
JUST STOP. STOP TALKING.
STOP WORRYING.

18:16.566 --> 18:19.329
STOP THINKING. STOP.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.331
CAN WE--CAN WE--
CAN WE JUST--

18:21.331 --> 18:24.334
CAN WE JUST TRY IT MY WAY,
PLEASE?
NO.

18:24.334 --> 18:27.337
(reel clicks)

18:28.738 --> 18:31.681
I CAN'T STOP.

18:31.681 --> 18:34.544
I CAN'T TURN MY MIND OFF.

18:34.544 --> 18:36.516
YES, YOU CAN.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.647
BUT--

18:37.647 --> 18:39.389
YOU CAN.

18:39.389 --> 18:41.651
JUST FISH.

18:43.193 --> 18:46.796
(birds calling)

18:46.796 --> 18:48.398
(sighs)

18:51.261 --> 18:52.762
(line clicks)

18:52.762 --> 18:54.504
(Teddy) DO IT PRO BONO.

18:54.504 --> 18:56.506
LOOK, HENRY NEEDS
LONG-TERM MEDICAL CARE,

18:56.506 --> 18:59.509
AND THE HOSPITAL JUST CAN'T
AFFORD TO TAKE THAT ON.
OH, SO WE DO NOTHING?

18:59.509 --> 19:01.541
NO, WE TREAT HIM WITH DRUGS
AND WE SCHEDULE

19:01.541 --> 19:03.613
REGULAR FOLLOW-UPS
AT THE CLINIC.

19:03.613 --> 19:05.615
WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
DO NOTHING.

19:05.615 --> 19:08.518
LOOK, I WISH I COULD TREAT HIM.
I REALLY DO.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.920
BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.
THAT IS A LOAD OF CRAP.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.922
I HAVE SEEN YOU
BEND THE RULES AROUND HERE.

19:12.922 --> 19:15.285
IF I WAS BAILEY OR SHEPHERD,

19:15.285 --> 19:18.288
I'M SURE THAT YOUR HANDS
WOULDN'T BE SO TIED.
DR. ALTMAN, THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:18.288 --> 19:19.829
I'M SORRY.

19:19.829 --> 19:23.293
CRISTINA YANG
IS FISHING TODAY.

19:23.293 --> 19:25.695
SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED
SURGICAL RESIDENTS

19:25.695 --> 19:27.297
I HAVE EVER SEEN,

19:27.297 --> 19:29.299
AND SHE IS FISHING
INSTEAD OF OPERATING,

19:29.299 --> 19:31.801
AND THAT IS PARTLY MY FAULT.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.943
I JUST WANT TO DO
SOMETHING GOOD TODAY.

19:33.943 --> 19:37.176
MAKE IT UP, PAY IT FORWARD--
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT--

19:37.176 --> 19:40.450
I... I JUST NEED TO DO
SOME GOOD.

19:40.450 --> 19:43.813
♪♪♪

19:43.813 --> 19:47.317
(sighs) I'LL...
SET UP A MEETING

19:47.317 --> 19:48.718
WITH THE REVIEW BOARD.

19:48.718 --> 19:51.821
THANK YOU.

19:51.821 --> 19:54.824
LOOK, THEY MET WITH DR. MILLER
THREE HOURS AGO.

19:54.824 --> 19:57.827
GIVE IT TIME.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA CALL
'CAUSE THEY'RE IDIOTS.

19:57.827 --> 20:00.330
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M GOING
UP TO MILLER'S OFFICE

20:00.330 --> 20:02.632
TO TELL 'EM
WHAT IDIOTS THEY ARE.
NO, THEY'RE GONNACALL.

20:02.632 --> 20:05.475
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING STUBBORN.
YES, I AM BEING STUBBORN.

20:05.475 --> 20:07.477
I AM STUBBORNLY
CHOOSING TO BELIEVE

20:07.477 --> 20:09.479
THAT SOMETIMES
PEOPLE MAKE SANE DECISIONS,

20:09.479 --> 20:12.382
LIKE HAVING MINIMALLY INVASIVE
SURGERY WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE.

20:12.382 --> 20:14.384
I AM STUBBORNLY CHOOSING
TO BELIEVE THAT

20:14.384 --> 20:17.387
NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE EVIL AND BAD
AND LEAVE ME IN AIRPORTS.

20:17.387 --> 20:19.519
(rings and buzzes)

20:19.519 --> 20:21.851
(rings and buzzes)
HMM.

20:21.851 --> 20:23.753
(rings and buzzes)
TOLD YA.

20:23.753 --> 20:26.496
GOOD. THE SHUNT IS IN.
SECURE IT INFERIORLY.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.358
UMBILICAL TAPE.

20:28.358 --> 20:30.930
(woman) HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.
UH, NOW WE'RE GONNA FIX
THE I.V.C.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.633
I'M GONNA LIFT THE LIVER
ONLY ENOUGH FOR YOU

20:33.633 --> 20:36.466
TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE TEAR.
YOU'RE GONNA LET ME SEW?

20:36.466 --> 20:39.469
ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY JUDGMENT
OR ARE YOU SAYING THANK YOU?

20:39.469 --> 20:41.611
NO, I JUST...
THANK YOU.

20:41.611 --> 20:43.643
GOOD. SO...

20:43.643 --> 20:45.415
ONE STITCH AT A TIME.

20:45.415 --> 20:47.947
SLOW AND STEADY. READY?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.880
OKAY. 3-0 PROLENE, BOKI.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.482
MM. ANYBODY WANT MY SOUP?

20:52.482 --> 20:54.484
IT'S REMINDING ME
OF PANCREATIC FLUID.

20:54.484 --> 20:56.686
OH, MM-HMM.
THEN I DEFINITELY WANT IT.

20:56.686 --> 20:58.428
SPARKLE.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.630
THAT WAS THE NAME
OF MY PONY.

21:00.630 --> 21:02.261
DR. KEPNER, YOUR PATIENT,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.634
MRS. HATHAWAY
JUST CAME INTO THE E.R.

21:04.634 --> 21:06.636
SHE'S IN SEPTIC SHOCK.
C.T. SHOWED A FISTULA.

21:06.636 --> 21:08.998
DR. BAILEY WANTS YOU
IN O.R. 2 RIGHT AWAY.
NO. MRS. HATHAWAY?

21:08.998 --> 21:11.871
WE JUST DISCHARGED HER
THREE DAYS AGO. SHE WAS FINE!
HMM.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.574
AND THEN THERE WERE TWO.

21:17.707 --> 21:20.710
UM, ELI, I NEED ANOTHER SAMPLE
OF MR. RABB'S FLUID.

21:20.710 --> 21:23.653
UH, THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.
I TOOK THE DRAIN OUT.

21:23.653 --> 21:25.655
YOU WHAT?
WELL, WITH THE DRAIN IN,

21:25.655 --> 21:27.987
HE CAN'T TURN OVER, WHICH MEANS
HE HAS TO SLEEP ON HIS BACK,

21:27.987 --> 21:31.561
WHICH MEANS
HE ISN'T SLEEPING, SO--
OKAY, JUST CALL RADIOLOGY.
WE HAVE TO PUT IT BACK IN.

21:31.561 --> 21:33.593
I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO SEE THE FLUID

21:33.593 --> 21:36.466
TO TELL IF THERE'S AN INFECTION.
WELL, I CAN TELL BY LOOKING
AT IT THAT IT'S NOT INFECTED.

21:36.466 --> 21:40.069
JUST CALL RADIOLOGY.
LOOK, IF DR. BAILEY WANTS IT
PUT BACK IN, THEN I WILL.

21:40.069 --> 21:42.502
NO, SHE'S IN SURGERY.
WELL, THEN IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.335
FINE. OKAY. YOU KNOW,
I'LL--I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
THAT PATIENT.

21:45.335 --> 21:46.736
EXCUSE ME?

21:46.736 --> 21:50.309
YOU HAVE YOUR LIST, BUT I HAVE
12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

21:50.309 --> 21:52.842
THAT TELLS ME THAT PUTTING
THAT DRAIN BACK IN RIGHT NOW

21:52.842 --> 21:55.345
COULD ACTUALLY PUT HIM
AT MORE RISK FOR INFECTION.

21:55.345 --> 21:57.987
12 YEARS, I'VE BEEN HERE--
12 YEARS.

21:57.987 --> 21:59.989
NOW YOU RESIDENTS,
YOU COME AND GO,

21:59.989 --> 22:02.522
BUT THIS IS MY HOME,
AND YOU ARE MY GUEST.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.924
AND RIGHT NOW,
YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.756
(people speak indistinctly)

22:14.464 --> 22:18.368
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:18.368 --> 22:20.009
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

22:20.009 --> 22:22.011
OH, UH, I NEED A FAVOR.

22:22.011 --> 22:23.913
A NURSE HATES ME.

22:23.913 --> 22:25.645
YOU'RE A RESIDENT.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.647
I'M SURE ALL THE NURSES
HATE YOU.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.680
YES, WELL, THEY LOVE YOU.
I THINK YOU LOVE ME.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.752
FINE. OKAY. WHATEVER.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.754
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST TALK TO HIM,

22:34.754 --> 22:36.756
SMOOTH THINGS OVER,
SO THAT WHEN I GO TO TAKE

22:36.756 --> 22:39.559
MY PATIENT BACK TO RADIOLOGY
AND GET HIS DRAIN PUT BACK IN,

22:39.559 --> 22:41.090
HE DOESN'T MAKE A SCENE?

22:41.090 --> 22:42.892
FINE. I'LL TALK TO HIM.

22:42.892 --> 22:46.596
BUT YOU GOTTA MEET ME
AT JOE'S TONIGHT FOR A DRINK.
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

22:46.596 --> 22:48.598
THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE ME,
'CAUSE I'M UNBELIEVABLE.

22:48.598 --> 22:52.041
YOU AND I, WE DON'T WORK, OKAY?
WE-WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.943
ONE DRINK.

22:53.943 --> 22:56.646
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:56.646 --> 22:58.608
FINE. ONE DRINK.

22:58.608 --> 23:01.050
OH, GOD.
OKAY, THERE HE IS.

23:01.050 --> 23:03.583
ELI?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.814
E--

23:04.814 --> 23:06.916
TWO DRINKS.

23:06.916 --> 23:08.057
FINE.

23:08.057 --> 23:10.059
FINE. STAY HERE.

23:10.059 --> 23:12.592
(door opens)

23:12.592 --> 23:14.424
ELI.
YEAH.

23:14.424 --> 23:16.426
(snaps fingers)
YOU GOT A SECOND?

23:16.426 --> 23:18.968
OH, LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

23:18.968 --> 23:21.971
BUT I KNOW BETTER THAN TO
MESS WITH YOU ON YOUR TURF,

23:21.971 --> 23:23.973
SO DO ME A SOLID.
MM-HMM.

23:23.973 --> 23:27.607
NOD, ACT AS IF WE'RE HAVING
A BIG DEBATE HERE,

23:27.607 --> 23:30.409
'CAUSE DR. GREY OVER THERE,

23:30.409 --> 23:33.543
SHE AGREED TO GO OUT WITH ME
IF I TALK TO YOU.

23:33.543 --> 23:36.546
SHE'S BOSSY.
I KNOW. I DIG IT.

23:36.546 --> 23:39.589
MM. WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

23:39.589 --> 23:41.420
SEAHAWKS, SUNDAY, BOX SEATS.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.422
PARKING?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.824
OF COURSE.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.557
MM-HMM. OKAY.

23:47.557 --> 23:51.430
UNLESS DR. BAILEY HERSELF
ORDERS THAT DRAIN PUT BACK IN,

23:51.430 --> 23:52.702
I--

23:52.702 --> 23:55.104
NOW MENTION HOW HIGHLY
I THINK OF HER.

23:55.104 --> 23:57.867
I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK
DR. GREY IS THE BEST RESIDENT

23:57.867 --> 24:00.139
YOU'VE EVER SEEN
COME THROUGH THIS PROGRAM.
MM-HMM. I UNDERSTAND.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.572
AND I RESPECT THAT.
THANK YOU.

24:02.572 --> 24:03.673
YEAH.

24:07.817 --> 24:10.950
WELL, I DID WHAT I COULD.
WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OFF?

24:10.950 --> 24:13.753
WHAT?! THAT'S IT.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.454
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.230
YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH SLOAN TONIGHT?

24:21.230 --> 24:23.633
ONE DRINK, AND THEN YOU
ARE GONNA INTERRUPT US

24:23.633 --> 24:25.635
AND TELL ME THAT THERE'S
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.637
WELL, THERE MIGHTBE
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY

24:27.637 --> 24:30.600
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT DRAIN
BACK IN YOUR GUY.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.602
I'M JUST SAYIN',
I GUESS YOU CAN OBSERVE

24:32.602 --> 24:34.544
WHEN I'M
TAKING OUT THAT GALLBLADDER

24:34.544 --> 24:36.245
THROUGH A DUDE'S MOUTH.
(chuckles)

24:36.245 --> 24:38.247
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:38.247 --> 24:41.751
DR. HUNT, I UPDATED MRS. PAIZ
AND CHECKED YOUR CALLS.

24:41.751 --> 24:43.783
UH, DR. MARSHALL
FROM N.Y.U. CALLED

24:43.783 --> 24:45.184
ABOUT SPEAKING
AT THEIR CONFERENCE,

24:45.184 --> 24:47.787
AND THE LAB CALLED WITH RESULTS
FOR YOUR KIDNEY PATIENT.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.789
THAT IT?
N-NOTHING FROM MY WIFE?

24:49.789 --> 24:52.662
NO, THAT'S IT.
(sighs)

24:52.662 --> 24:54.223
YOU READY?

24:54.223 --> 24:56.926
LIFTING THE LIVER.

24:56.926 --> 24:59.929
(birds chirping)

25:11.510 --> 25:14.043
(Derek sighs)

25:14.043 --> 25:16.045
DR. MILLER CAN'T FIT RON IN
FOR THREE WEEKS,

25:16.045 --> 25:18.047
AND WE CALLED
OUR DAUGHTER IN SARASOTA,

25:18.047 --> 25:20.049
AND SHE SAID
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT,

25:20.049 --> 25:23.052
BUT RON WANTS IT, AND I-I JUST
WANT WHAT RON WANTS,

25:23.052 --> 25:26.055
SO, UM, TELL HER, RON,
TELL HER WE WANT THIS 2:00 SLOT.

25:26.055 --> 25:29.158
OH, YEAH, I WISH I COULD,
BUT I'M--I'M ALREADY BOOKED.

25:29.158 --> 25:31.030
NO--NO, YOU'RE NOT.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.633
YEAH, I AM. YEAH.
I HAVE THAT, UM...

25:33.633 --> 25:35.064
FUSED KNEE THING.

25:35.064 --> 25:37.166
RIGHT, RIGHT,
THE GUY WITH THE KNEE.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.769
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
LET ME SEE IF I CAN, UH,

25:39.769 --> 25:41.210
SWITCH SOME THINGS AROUND.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.073
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

25:44.073 --> 25:46.175
OH, WHAT IF I PUSH THAT
DOWN TO LATER?

25:46.175 --> 25:49.178
NO, YOU'RE GETTING THAT AWARD
TONIGHT. YOU CAN'T MISS THAT.

25:49.178 --> 25:50.780
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.682
SHOOT.

25:52.682 --> 25:54.684
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:54.684 --> 25:58.057
I'LL DO RON, AND THEN I'LL
JUST BE LATE FOR THE DINNER.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.059
I AM SO SICK OF THOSE
AWARDS DINNERS ANYWAY.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.292
IT'S LIKE...
WAKA, WAKA, WAKA. (laughs)
THANK YOU.

26:03.292 --> 26:05.064
YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.667
THANKS.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.068
ELI.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.070
DR. BAILEY,
HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY

26:11.070 --> 26:13.072
HOW MUCH I LIKE YOUR EYES?

26:13.072 --> 26:16.075
D--I AM NOT IN THE MOOD.
WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE DRAIN?

26:16.075 --> 26:19.048
BECAUSE IT WAS READY
TO BE REMOVED.
NOW I HAVE TO PUT THE DRAIN
BACK IN.

26:19.048 --> 26:21.050
AND WRITE YOU UP.
'CAUSE THAT--

26:21.050 --> 26:23.783
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
WRITE--WRITE HIM UP.
LET ME HANDLE THIS, GREY.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.286
OKAY, MR. RABB IS NOT SLEEPING,
DOCTOR. THAT'S A PROBLEM BEC--
OKAY, I FEEL FOR HIM,

26:27.286 --> 26:29.288
BUT THIS PROTOCOL
ISN'T JUST ABOUT HIM.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.290
I DON'T DO PROTOCOLS.
I TREAT PATIENTS.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.093
ELI, SAVE YOUR HIGH-AND-MIGHTY
ROUTINE FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.226
NOW I'M SICK OF ALL OF THESE
POST-OP COMPLICATIONS.
I HATE POST-OP COMPLICATIONS
MORE THAN YOU DO, DR. BAILEY.

26:37.226 --> 26:39.228
I DO. THEY'RE TIME CONSUMING.
THEY'RE MESSY.

26:39.228 --> 26:41.100
THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO CHECK UP

26:41.100 --> 26:43.032
ON MY FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM
AS OFTEN AS I'D LIKE,

26:43.032 --> 26:45.635
SO I MAKE SURE THAT
MY PATIENTS DON'T GET THEM.

26:45.635 --> 26:47.877
I MEAN, YOU KNOW YOU'RE HAPPY
WHEN I'M WORKING.

26:47.877 --> 26:50.109
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE
OF MY PRETTY FACE.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.041
IT'S 'CAUSE I'M GOOD
AT WHAT I DO.

26:52.041 --> 26:54.043
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU HAD

26:54.043 --> 26:56.716
A POST-OP COMPLICATION
WITH ONE OF MY PATIENTS? HMM?

26:56.716 --> 26:58.718
GOOD WORK.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.720
I THINK I CAN GET
ANOTHER STITCH IN.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.622
WE CAN'T RISK IT. THERE'S
TOO MUCH PULL ON THE LIVER.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.355
I'M LOWERING IT.
I WANT TO TRY.

27:06.355 --> 27:09.628
NO.
THERE'S NOT AS MUCH BLOOD
IN THE FIELD AS BEFORE.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.631
HE CAN HANDLE ANOTHER STITCH.
REMOVE YOUR HAND, DR. GREY.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.033
JUST ANOTHER SECOND.
DON'T--

27:14.033 --> 27:16.736
DONE.I GOT IT.
I--LOWER THE LIVER.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.738
GET OUT OF MY O.R.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.971
WHAT? I DID IT. LOOK.
SEE? HE'S FINE.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT AGAIN.

27:21.971 --> 27:23.642
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:23.642 --> 27:25.644
(suction gurgling)

27:25.644 --> 27:28.377
(instrument clatters)

27:28.377 --> 27:30.920
(instrument clatters)

27:30.920 --> 27:32.321
(beeping continues)

27:32.321 --> 27:33.923
(clicks button)

27:33.923 --> 27:35.424
(door hisses)

27:43.733 --> 27:45.965
NO, I JUST GOT KICKED OUT
OF THE O.R.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.237
BECAUSE I'M JUST SO SICK
OF ALL OF THIS.

27:48.237 --> 27:50.239
I'M SICK OF HER
NOT TALKING TO ME.

27:50.239 --> 27:52.341
I'M SICK OF YOU TWO
PRETENDING TO BE FRIENDS.

27:52.341 --> 27:54.343
So put her on the phone.

27:54.343 --> 27:57.346
WELL, THANK YOU, DR. KELLER.
I THINK YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,

27:57.346 --> 27:59.809
COILING THE ANEURYSM
RATHER THAN CLIPPING IT.

27:59.809 --> 28:01.310
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE,

28:01.310 --> 28:03.913
AND I WILL
CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER.
(beeps)

28:03.913 --> 28:05.354
WAS THAT MEREDITH?

28:05.354 --> 28:07.056
NO.

28:08.958 --> 28:10.219
YES.

28:12.161 --> 28:13.692
(line clicks)

28:13.692 --> 28:16.225
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
I THINK I HAVE A BITE.

28:16.225 --> 28:18.397
OH, MY GOD! WHAT DO I--
WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO?!

28:18.397 --> 28:21.300
OH, MY GOD! WHAT DO I DO?!
STAY CALM. STAY CALM.
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.973
OH! OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD.
OKAY, OKAY. I'M SITTING DOWN.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.105
I DIDN'T READ THE PART
WHERE YOU--

28:26.105 --> 28:28.707
WHAT--WHAT TO DO
WHEN YOU CATCH A FISH.
OKAY, LET IT RUN FOR A SECOND.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.310
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!
STAY RIGHT THERE. SIT DOWN.

28:31.310 --> 28:34.113
OKAY, OKAY.
LET IT--LET THE FISH RUN
A LITTLE. LET IT--LET IT--

28:34.113 --> 28:36.445
OKAY, GO. GO, GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO, GO.
GIVE IT SOME--JUST GIVE IT
SOME--THERE IT IS.

28:36.445 --> 28:38.717
OKAY, OKAY. NOW WHAT?
GIVE IT SOME LINE. LET IT GO.
EASY. LET IT--

28:38.717 --> 28:41.020
YES.
LET IT TIRE ITSELF OUT.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.452
OKAY.
EASY. NOW REEL IT IN.

28:43.452 --> 28:45.454
REELING IT IN. OKAY.
GOOD, GOOD.
GOOD, GOOD.
SEE, YOU'RE FISHING.

28:45.454 --> 28:48.127
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD! I'M FISHING!
(Derek speaks indistinctly)

28:48.127 --> 28:50.399
I'M FISHING! (laughs) AAH!
(laughs) YOU'RE FISHING.
WHOA!

28:50.399 --> 28:52.902
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:52.902 --> 28:54.764
OKAY.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.505
(chuckles) YOU'RE GOOD.

28:56.505 --> 28:59.138
YEAH, WELL,
TELL THAT TO STARK.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.140
STARK? PLEASE.
YOU DON'T NEED STARK.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.912
YOU KNOW WHY?

29:02.912 --> 29:05.875
IN A YEAR, EVERYONE'S GONNA
WANT THIS SURGERY...
(bangs tool)

29:05.875 --> 29:08.347
EXCEPT THERE'S ONLY
ONE OF ME.

29:08.347 --> 29:12.822
UNLESS...
I CREATE ANOTHER ME.

29:12.822 --> 29:14.984
THAT COULD BE YOU--

29:14.984 --> 29:16.385
THE GUY ME.

29:16.385 --> 29:19.528
NOT AS PRETTY, NOT AS GOOD,
BUT CLOSE.

29:19.528 --> 29:22.231
I COULD TEACH YOU
IF YOU WANT.

29:22.231 --> 29:24.533
SCREW STARK.

29:24.533 --> 29:27.036
(laughs)
STARK'S LOSS IS MY GAIN.

29:27.036 --> 29:28.367
(laughs)

29:28.367 --> 29:31.440
OKAY, RON,
HERE COMES YOUR NEW HIP.

29:35.444 --> 29:38.107
COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

29:38.107 --> 29:40.109
UH, GUYS,
GIVE US THE ROOM.

29:40.109 --> 29:41.851
YES, DOCTOR.

29:43.252 --> 29:45.254
(door opens)

29:45.254 --> 29:47.917
(door closes)

29:47.917 --> 29:51.190
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING. I KNEW
I COULD DO THAT SECOND STITCH.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.192
AND YOU KNEW I COULD DO
THAT SECOND STITCH.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.895
AND IF IT WERE ANYONE ELSE,
YOU WOULD'VE LET THEM DO IT.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.498
BUT BECAUSE I QUESTION
HOW YOU HANDLE CRISTINA

29:59.498 --> 30:01.931
YOU CHOSE TO SLAP ME DOWN

30:01.931 --> 30:05.304
AND LET EVERYBODY KNOW
WHO'S BOSS.
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.906
I THINK YOU'RE RECKLESS.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.208
I THINK YOU'RE RECKLESS
WITH YOUR OWN LIFE,

30:09.208 --> 30:11.380
AND TODAY, YOU WERE RECKLESS
WITH A PATIENT'S LIFE.

30:11.380 --> 30:14.483
AND I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE,
I DON'T WANT THAT IN MY O.R.,

30:14.483 --> 30:16.485
AND I DO NOT WANT THAT
AROUND MY WIFE,

30:16.485 --> 30:18.487
WHO IS STRUGGLING
JUST TO HOLD ON.

30:18.487 --> 30:21.120
YOUR WIFE IS STRUGGLING
JUST TO HOLD ON

30:21.120 --> 30:23.292
BECAUSE YOU MARRIED HER

30:23.292 --> 30:27.126
AND LET IT BE OKAY FOR HER
TOCOMPLETELYFALL APART.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.959
WHAT IS CRISTINA GONNA DO
WHEN SHE GETS BACK

30:29.959 --> 30:32.101
FROM HER FISHING TRIP TONIGHT,

30:32.101 --> 30:35.034
TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK,
NEXT MONTH, NEXT YEAR?

30:35.034 --> 30:37.436
BECAUSE WE'LL ALL
BE HERE WORKING,

30:37.436 --> 30:39.568
AND CRISTINA WILL BE...
WHERE?

30:39.568 --> 30:41.570
I DON'T KNOW.
OH.

30:41.570 --> 30:44.343
I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE HAS
THE RIGHT TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.345
YOU DON'T KNOW.
WELL, I KNOW,

30:46.345 --> 30:48.347
BECAUSE I KNOW CRISTINA YANG.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.349
AND SHE NEEDS TO WORK,

30:50.349 --> 30:53.382
BECAUSE SURGERY
IS WHO WE ARE.

30:53.382 --> 30:55.484
YOU TOLD A GUY WITH A GUN
TO SHOOT YOU.

30:55.484 --> 30:58.087
THATIS WHO YOU ARE.
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WI--

30:58.087 --> 31:00.189
YOU--YOU ARE FEARLESS,
AND I DON'T MEAN THAT

31:00.189 --> 31:01.590
IN A GOOD WAY.

31:01.590 --> 31:05.034
MOST PEOPLE DON'T TELL THE GUY
WITH THE GUN TO SHOOT THEM.

31:05.034 --> 31:08.397
MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE CRISTINA.
MOST PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.

31:08.397 --> 31:11.540
SO WHAT SHE NEEDS
ISN'T WHAT YOU NEED.

31:11.540 --> 31:15.174
(exhales deeply)

31:15.174 --> 31:17.476
SHE ISN'T YOU...

31:17.476 --> 31:19.148
MEREDITH.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.182
WELL, HE'S RIGHT.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.184
HIS PATIENT RECORDS
FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS

31:25.184 --> 31:27.886
SHOW A POST-OP COMPLICATION RATE
WAY LOWER THAN THE NORM.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
WAIT, 12% COMPARED TO 42%?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.290
YEAH.
WOW.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.892
OKAY, CAN YOU TWO STOP
BEING IMPRESSED BY HIM?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.065
IT'S A FLUKE.
HE'S MEAN.

31:36.065 --> 31:38.067
HAND ME THOSE CHARTS.
I THINK HE'S KINDA HOT.

31:38.067 --> 31:40.069
CAN YOU SAY THAT
ABOUT A NURSE?
NO.

31:40.069 --> 31:41.670
OKAY. OH.
DAY THREE.

31:41.670 --> 31:44.603
DAY...

31:44.603 --> 31:47.576
THREE.

31:47.576 --> 31:49.178
DAY THREE.

31:49.178 --> 31:50.579
YEAH?
WHAT?

31:50.579 --> 31:52.181
(Jackson) DAY THREE?

31:52.181 --> 31:55.184
OH. OH, OH, OH, OKAY, DEEP--
DEEP BREATHS.

31:55.184 --> 31:57.546
DEEPBREATHS.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.148
OOH, YES.

31:59.148 --> 32:01.320
DR. BAILEY?
OKAY. OKAY.

32:01.320 --> 32:05.224
OKAY,
SHOULD WE BE FOLLOWING HER?

32:05.224 --> 32:06.996
A MedicAlert BRACELET?

32:06.996 --> 32:09.198
THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION?

32:09.198 --> 32:11.660
IF THE PATIENT HAS
A HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS--

32:11.660 --> 32:15.434
WHEN... WHEN HE HAS
A HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS...

32:15.434 --> 32:17.436
THE PARAMEDICS WILL BRING
MR. BURTON HERE,

32:17.436 --> 32:19.408
AND WE'LL TREAT
HIS EMERGENT CONDITION.

32:19.408 --> 32:21.410
YEAH, THAT'LL BE TOO LATE.
HE'LL BE DEAD.

32:21.410 --> 32:23.412
SO YOU'RE SENDING HIM HOME
TO DIE,

32:23.412 --> 32:26.275
BUT YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM

32:26.275 --> 32:29.018
A BRACELET WITH HIS NAME
ON IT.
HEY!

32:29.018 --> 32:33.152
UM, IF WE REMOVE THE DRAIN ON
DAY THREE INSTEAD OF DAY FIVE,

32:33.152 --> 32:36.255
WE CAN REDUCE THE FORMATION
OF FISTULAS BY 30%.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.258
SEE, UH, ELI TOOK OUT A DRAIN
WHEN HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO,

32:39.258 --> 32:41.690
AND I WAS GONNA WRITE HIM UP
BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO THAT,

32:41.690 --> 32:43.962
BUT HE DID.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.696
UH, I'M GOING TOLEAVE
THESE FILES FOR YOU TO LOOK AT.

32:47.696 --> 32:50.299
OH. UH--

32:50.299 --> 32:53.272
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M... MIRANDA BAILEY--

32:53.272 --> 32:55.444
THE DOCTOR WHO CURED FISTULA.

32:55.444 --> 32:57.276
THAT'S RIGHT.
I SAID IT. (laughs)

32:57.276 --> 32:59.608
UH, JONAS SALK--
HE CURED POLIO.

32:59.608 --> 33:04.583
MIRANDA BAILEY
IS GOING TO CURE FISTULA.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.255
(chuckles)

33:06.255 --> 33:10.189
(laughs) TH-TH-THREE.
DAY THREE.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.526
28... POUNDS.
(Derek laughs)

33:17.526 --> 33:19.998
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST
WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR.
AH, LOOK AT THAT.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.470
WOW.
NICE FISH.

33:21.470 --> 33:23.632
THANKS.
YOU WANT A PICTURE?

33:23.632 --> 33:26.105
OH, DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY.
TAKE A PICTURE. COME ON.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.507
LET'S TAKE A PICTURE.
ALL RIGHT. YOU PICK IT UP,
I'LL GET THE CAMERA.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.140
(Cristina) OH, MY GOD. HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO PICK IT UP?
YOU JUST PICK IT UP
AND TAKE IT OFF. YOU CAN.

33:31.140 --> 33:33.682
IT'S VERY SLIPPERY,
SO BE CAREFUL.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

33:33.682 --> 33:36.685
HOLD IT UP LIKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT? READY? GREAT.
YES, YES, OH, GOD. OH, MY GOD.
IT'S TOTALLY HEAVY.

33:36.685 --> 33:38.687
OKAY, READY?

33:38.687 --> 33:41.290
YEAH, FIRST TIME.

(Cristina laughs)
YES, SHE IS.

35:13.482 --> 35:15.484
JASON, HONEY.

35:15.484 --> 35:18.447
WE WERE ABLE TO REPAIR
THE DAMAGE,

35:18.447 --> 35:21.720
BUT THE NEXT 24 HOURS
ARE CRUCIAL.
BUT HE CAN RECOVER, RIGHT?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.323
IF--IF EVERYTHING GOES OKAY,
HE'LL FULLY RECOVER?

35:24.323 --> 35:27.196
WE'RE JUST FOCUSING ON
GETTING JASON THROUGH THE NIGHT.

35:27.196 --> 35:28.727

BUT TRY NOT TO THINK
TOO FAR INTO THE FUTURE.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.262
I'M AFRAID TO TOUCH HIM.

35:33.262 --> 35:36.265
(Meredith) I KNOW RIGHT NOW
ALL YOU CAN SEE

35:36.265 --> 35:38.567
ARE THE MACHINES
AND THE DAMAGE,

35:38.567 --> 35:40.609
BUT HE'S STILL THERE.

THERE'S MY STAR RESIDENT.

36:03.732 --> 36:05.734
COME ON. WE'RE DRINKING.
I'M BUYING.

36:05.734 --> 36:08.337
OH, DUDE. SORRY, I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

36:08.337 --> 36:10.539
STARK ENDED UP HATING THE GUY
WHO ASSISTED HIM TODAY

36:10.539 --> 36:12.541
EVEN MORE THAN HE HATES ME.
(laugh) OH, GOD.

36:12.541 --> 36:15.444
ANYWAY, THERE'S A MIDGUT
VOLVULUS, AND I'M GONNA ASSIST.

36:15.444 --> 36:16.845
(elevator bell dings)

36:16.845 --> 36:18.847
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO STARK?

36:18.847 --> 36:20.879
I MEAN, THE GUY'S A DOUCHE,
AND--AND HIPS ARE COOL,

36:20.879 --> 36:23.181
BUT YOU KNOW--
JUST GO.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.184
(indistinct conversations)

36:30.589 --> 36:32.321
I'M STILL AWESOME.

36:32.321 --> 36:34.323
(Richard) I'VE PRESCRIBED
ALPHA BLOCKERS

36:34.323 --> 36:37.366
AND SET YOU UP
IN OUR FREE CLINIC.

36:37.366 --> 36:41.470
YOU NEED ANYTHING AT ALL...
CALL ME.

36:41.470 --> 36:43.372
WE'RE GONNA
SEE YOU THROUGH THIS.

36:43.372 --> 36:45.634
THANK YOU.

36:50.879 --> 36:52.841
HEY.

36:52.841 --> 36:55.444
UM...

36:57.346 --> 37:00.218
I TRIED. I'M SORRY.
I, UH--

37:00.218 --> 37:01.750
I'LL BE OKAY.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.822
DR. WEBBER SLIPPED ME
SOME FREE SAMPLES,

37:03.822 --> 37:05.824
SO I'M GOOD FOR A WHILE.

37:05.824 --> 37:09.358
GOOD. GOOD.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.862
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

37:22.711 --> 37:25.744
I HAVE
GREAT MEDICAL INSURANCE.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.718
(chuckles) WAY TO KICK A GUY
WHEN HE'S DOWN.

37:29.718 --> 37:31.720
I'M SAYING, I'M--I'M...

37:31.720 --> 37:34.383
(laughs)

37:34.383 --> 37:36.825
I'M SAYING
THAT I'LL MARRY YOU.

37:42.391 --> 37:44.493
UH...

37:44.493 --> 37:47.766
THAT'S
A REALLY GENEROUS OFFER.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.538
BUT I CAN'T.

37:49.538 --> 37:50.939
I'M A DOCTOR.

37:50.939 --> 37:52.541
