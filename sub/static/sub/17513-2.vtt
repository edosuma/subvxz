00:20.589 --> 00:22.556
Do I have to call you boss or anything?

00:22.557 --> 00:23.581
You can if you want.

00:23.582 --> 00:25.592
Or sir, Mr McCallum.
Whatever feels right.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.512
Dum-bum?

00:27.513 --> 00:28.597
You know, once we get in
there I'm your manager,

00:28.598 --> 00:30.585
so prepare to be managed.

00:32.593 --> 00:34.545
Uh.. Oh...

00:35.565 --> 00:37.524
Thank you.

00:39.545 --> 00:42.508
- Good morning, Mrs Marsh.
- Oh, hello.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.520
- How are things?
- Good.

00:44.521 --> 00:46.552
- Any calls?
- No.

00:46.553 --> 00:48.580
- Any messages?
- No.

00:48.581 --> 00:49.781
Emails?

00:50.601 --> 00:52.533
No.

00:53.585 --> 00:55.541
Good book?

00:56.585 --> 00:58.537
No.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.516
Thank you for choosing McCallum
Real Estate. This is Daniel.

01:21.517 --> 01:23.677
Yes, I'd love to sell your
house for a billion dollars.

01:24.605 --> 01:26.600
Excuse me, Sir Boss.

01:26.601 --> 01:28.548
First customer?

01:28.549 --> 01:30.533
Close. There's still no milk.

01:31.601 --> 01:33.560
Ooh, here we go.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.512
Time to real estate.

01:41.533 --> 01:44.584
Hi. Uh, thank you for choosing
McCallum Real Estate.

01:44.585 --> 01:47.516
This is... I'm Daniel. Hi.

01:47.517 --> 01:49.593
What can I do for... all of you?

01:52.541 --> 01:54.513
Where's Barbara?

02:27.573 --> 02:29.516
Where's Barbara?

02:29.517 --> 02:32.524
Uh, she's away at the
moment, so I am in charge.

02:32.525 --> 02:34.552
Wait, you're not Danny
McCallum, are you?

02:34.553 --> 02:36.556
- Daniel.
- I thought you were on the mainland.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.585
Uh, I was. I came back to...

02:37.585 --> 02:38.785
You couldn't hack it?

02:40.521 --> 02:42.524
You probably don't remember me, do you?

02:42.525 --> 02:43.597
Uh...

02:43.598 --> 02:45.556
Olive. I'm not surprised.

02:45.557 --> 02:46.601
You and your mother never turned up

02:46.602 --> 02:48.564
to any of the Neighbourhood
Watch meetings.

02:48.565 --> 02:50.564
Well, to be fair, there's
no crime in Rosehaven.

02:50.565 --> 02:52.565
- Thanks to us.
- Nice.

02:53.553 --> 02:56.532
Yeah, sorry, how can I help all of you?

02:56.533 --> 02:58.508
The locksmith's retired.

02:58.509 --> 02:59.709
His son Damien's taking over.

03:01.573 --> 03:02.589
Good?

03:02.590 --> 03:04.568
Not good. Damien's a weirdo.

03:04.569 --> 03:07.576
I don't want him
with the means to get into my house.

03:07.577 --> 03:09.596
No one here does. He's odd.

03:09.597 --> 03:13.577
Saw him smelling a bush
with no flowers once.

03:15.525 --> 03:16.549
Okay. Um...

03:16.550 --> 03:19.532
You tell him he's got no business
being Rosehaven's locksmith.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.581
Well, maybe he doesn't want to do it.

03:20.581 --> 03:21.605
Who wants to do their parents' job?

03:21.606 --> 03:24.508
It's like, find your own path,
right? Sorry.

03:24.509 --> 03:25.573
He wants to do it.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.597
You'll meet him. You'll see.

03:26.598 --> 03:28.596
You won't want him creeping
about in your undergarments.

03:28.597 --> 03:30.572
- Does he do that?
- Probably.

03:30.573 --> 03:31.593
And he's a hoarder.

03:31.594 --> 03:33.596
Yeah, sorry, we need a locksmith, so...

03:33.597 --> 03:36.552
I do not want Damien Nedbits
sneaking round my laundry,

03:36.553 --> 03:37.585
putting my pegs on himself.

03:37.586 --> 03:39.537
- Why... why would he...?
- Let's go.

03:54.509 --> 03:55.561
How's it going?

03:55.562 --> 03:58.532
The closest eyebrow place
is an hour and a half away.

03:58.533 --> 04:00.552
No, no, locksmiths. Is there
anyone other than Damien?

04:00.553 --> 04:06.512
Oh. One, but he's really far away
and he said he'd charge extra.

04:06.513 --> 04:07.585
Maybe we should call Barbara.

04:07.586 --> 04:11.524
No, I don't want to call her with
a problem my first day in charge.

04:11.525 --> 04:12.577
I'm sure we can work this out.

04:12.578 --> 04:14.572
Are locksmiths allowed
to visit people in jail?

04:14.573 --> 04:17.516
I don't know. Do they check
visitors' jobs when you go in?

04:17.517 --> 04:21.507
Like, "Hello, I'd like to see my
friend. I'm a demolitions expert"?

04:21.509 --> 04:23.512
No, I'm not going to let you in.
Get out of here.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.520
- You're a demolitions expert.
- Is there a problem, Miss?

04:25.521 --> 04:27.524
All right. Can you give him
this large, ticking cake, please?

04:27.525 --> 04:29.528
I'll find out how much
we paid the old locksmith.

04:29.529 --> 04:30.581
Maybe the call-out fee isn't that bad.

04:30.582 --> 04:32.540
Good plan. I'm going to the op shop.

04:32.541 --> 04:34.516
- What for?
- I need clothes.

04:34.517 --> 04:35.573
- Okay. You can go on your break.
- Great.

04:35.574 --> 04:37.560
No, no, I meant you can go on
your break, which is later.

04:37.561 --> 04:38.569
Okay, I'll move it to now.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.536
Okay, but that means
you can't take your break later.

04:40.537 --> 04:41.565
Well, who knows what'll happen later.

04:41.566 --> 04:43.585
- Well, I do. You'll be working.
- See ya!

05:04.521 --> 05:07.520
- Hi, excuse me. I'm...
- Hello.

05:07.521 --> 05:09.528
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you before.

05:09.529 --> 05:10.565
Are you lost, or...?

05:10.566 --> 05:12.604
No, I'm just down visiting.
I'm a Rosehaven virgin.

05:12.605 --> 05:15.544
Oh. So what are you doing here?

05:15.545 --> 05:16.601
- Flat tyre, or...?
- No.

05:16.602 --> 05:18.600
- Do you know Daniel McCallum?
- Danny?

05:18.601 --> 05:20.580
- Yes.
- There's a Rosehaven virgin.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.544
Glad he's found someone.

05:22.545 --> 05:23.601
Me? Oh, no, we're friends.

05:23.602 --> 05:27.577
Oh. Poor Danny. Again.

05:28.601 --> 05:32.540
But he's had sex, on the mainland.
Heaps. Too much.

05:32.541 --> 05:36.536
Oh. Well, really. Well, go, Danny.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.596
Yeah, he's been bangin'.
Anyway, I need some clothes.

05:39.597 --> 05:41.572
- I've only got this and beach wear.
- Oh.

05:41.573 --> 05:42.593
Beach wear?

05:42.594 --> 05:44.560
I say dress for the weather you want.

05:44.561 --> 05:47.513
Oh. Well, what about this blazer?

05:48.577 --> 05:50.532
Dying to get rid of it.

05:50.533 --> 05:51.553
Is it haunted?

05:51.554 --> 05:53.540
No, Ruby Maxwell brought it in

05:53.541 --> 05:56.520
and she's constantly popping by
to see if someone's bought it.

05:56.521 --> 05:58.604
I think she regrets giving it away,
but she's too proud to buy it back.

05:58.605 --> 06:00.572
Her husband bought it for her...

06:00.573 --> 06:02.524
after he unfriended her on Facebook

06:02.525 --> 06:03.573
because her posts were too long.

06:03.574 --> 06:06.512
- And they were too long...
- Sorry, I just have to take this.

06:06.513 --> 06:07.565
- Sorry.
- Okay.

06:07.566 --> 06:10.572
Hi, Mum. It's, um... good.

06:10.573 --> 06:16.560
I just, uh... Listen, Josh and I
are having sex right now.

06:16.561 --> 06:20.509
Yeah. Well, it's our honeymoon,
what are we gonna...

06:21.549 --> 06:24.524
Bali's beautiful, and I will put
some photos up not of us having sex.

06:24.525 --> 06:26.508
Okay, I've gotta go. Sorry about that.

06:26.509 --> 06:28.548
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah!

06:28.549 --> 06:32.532
Um, do you know,
I will take that blazer.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.565
What else have you got?

06:33.566 --> 06:35.600
- I'll take this one.
- Yes.

06:35.601 --> 06:39.512
That, and something from over...
from those stands as well.

06:39.513 --> 06:40.597
- Brown.
- Brown is good.

06:40.598 --> 06:42.512
Love a bit of brown?

06:42.513 --> 06:43.589
Yeah, I'll take that one, and that one.
Do you have bags?

06:43.590 --> 06:45.517
- So many.
- Great.

06:57.589 --> 07:00.513
- Do you need a hand?
- No.

07:01.569 --> 07:07.528
Do you... need... a...

07:07.529 --> 07:08.729
porcelain cow?

07:09.581 --> 07:11.592
- Thanks.
- How'd you go?

07:11.593 --> 07:15.540
Well, I couldn't find out
how much we paid the old locksmith

07:15.541 --> 07:18.520
because Mrs Marsh wouldn't give me
the internet banking password.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.544
Your mother wouldn't want you
snooping around on there.

07:21.545 --> 07:23.592
Well, you can't snoop around
a business you're in charge of.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.540
I'm sorry.

07:25.541 --> 07:28.552
I, uh... called Damien, he charges
a lot less than everyone else.

07:28.553 --> 07:29.601
Great. We'll use him.

07:29.602 --> 07:31.524
Yeah...

07:31.525 --> 07:32.553
What?

07:32.554 --> 07:34.540
Well, he sounded a bit... weird.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.553
So?

07:35.554 --> 07:37.512
Well, I mean,
we need to be able to trust him.

07:37.513 --> 07:38.593
He's going to have access to
everyone's homes, so...

07:38.594 --> 07:40.580
I'm going to go and meet him
and see what he's like.

07:40.581 --> 07:42.556
Where?

07:42.557 --> 07:44.520
He invited me round to his place.

07:44.521 --> 07:45.541
Yes!

07:45.541 --> 07:46.585
What?

07:46.586 --> 07:48.525
He's a hoarder.

08:10.605 --> 08:12.572
I still think you should have washed it.

08:12.573 --> 08:13.593
It's fine. They wash them.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.516
Yeah, I don't think they do.

08:15.517 --> 08:16.717
Oh, well.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.516
Yeah?

08:23.517 --> 08:25.544
Hi, Damien. Uh, I'm Daniel.
This is Emma.

08:25.545 --> 08:26.569
From McCallum Real Estate.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.601
I know. I wasn't expecting anyone else.

08:33.577 --> 08:35.580
Have a seat.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.544
- Oh! Magazines!
- Thanks for coming over.

08:38.544 --> 08:40.524
I don't like going out unless I have to.

08:40.525 --> 08:42.580
Do you know you could
sell these to dentists?

08:42.581 --> 08:46.572
Um... yeah, yeah. Looks like
you've got everything here.

08:46.573 --> 08:48.556
Do you know all of the things you have?

08:48.557 --> 08:52.508
Like, do you know what's in that box?

08:52.509 --> 08:53.593
Not sure.

08:53.594 --> 08:56.520
And you don't feel trapped?

08:56.521 --> 08:59.524
No. I find it comforting.

08:59.525 --> 09:00.557
It is a bit, isn't it?

09:00.558 --> 09:03.580
I always thought I'd be a hoarder.
You know, if I had more stuff.

09:03.581 --> 09:08.508
I was expecting it to be more hoardery.

09:08.509 --> 09:11.520
Like, no offence, but it's
just kind of cluttered.

09:11.521 --> 09:13.528
You can have a look around if you like.

09:13.529 --> 09:14.729
Yes, please.

09:20.537 --> 09:24.556
Uh, yeah, so, um... Damien,
thanks for inviting us over.

09:24.557 --> 09:27.520
I wanted to meet you if we were
going to be working together.

09:28.582 --> 09:30.604
So your Dad's retired?

09:30.605 --> 09:32.568
Yes.

09:32.569 --> 09:36.528
And you're planning on
taking over his business?

09:36.529 --> 09:40.512
Yeah. I can do odd jobs too.
Painting, maintenance. Whatever.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.581
What's this?

09:41.582 --> 09:45.532
Uh, that's the bottle cap of
every beer I've ever drunk.

09:45.533 --> 09:46.733
Amazing.

09:47.569 --> 09:51.532
So is there a code of
ethics for locksmiths?

09:51.533 --> 09:53.528
- Um...
- I just cut keys.

09:53.529 --> 09:55.516
Sure. You've never been to jail, or...?

09:55.517 --> 09:56.541
- What?
- Nothing.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.573
I love your place.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.520
Do you guys want some Frangelico?

10:01.521 --> 10:02.565
- Oh!
- No, we should be going.

10:02.566 --> 10:04.552
We just got here.

10:04.553 --> 10:08.520
Is this... is this a box of
just left-handed gloves?

10:08.521 --> 10:10.512
Yeah. Yeah, the right
ones are over there.

10:10.513 --> 10:11.713
Really?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.537
So you'll call me when you need me?

10:15.553 --> 10:17.516
Um... yeah, well..

10:17.517 --> 10:18.597
I found a match!

10:18.598 --> 10:20.536
What's that?

10:20.537 --> 10:22.509
Ooh, troll dolls!

10:24.593 --> 10:26.596
I like him. Upstanding citizen.

10:26.597 --> 10:28.604
Completely trustworthy.
Good cook, I imagine.

10:28.605 --> 10:31.512
You're not worried about
your undergarments?

10:31.513 --> 10:34.544
What? No. Didn't even think
about him in my undergarments.

10:34.545 --> 10:35.553
Shut up.

10:35.554 --> 10:37.512
I can kind of see why Olive's worried.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.600
- Why?
- Well, he's a bit odd.

10:39.601 --> 10:42.516
So what? Gherkins are odd,
and they're delicious.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.581
They just get a bad rap
because they look gross,

10:43.582 --> 10:45.524
and gherkin is the worst word ever.

10:45.525 --> 10:47.552
- I reckon 'brittle' is.
- What?

10:47.553 --> 10:49.532
Brittle. When is something
good if it's brittle?

10:49.533 --> 10:50.541
- Peanut brittle.
- Hey.

10:50.542 --> 10:52.508
Oh!

10:52.509 --> 10:53.585
You forgot this.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.604
- Oh, um, my wallet.
- Mm-hm.

10:55.605 --> 10:58.525
- Thanks, Damien.
- See ya.

11:00.553 --> 11:02.512
You're welcome.

11:02.513 --> 11:03.529
For what?

11:03.529 --> 11:04.557
Honesty test.

11:04.558 --> 11:06.552
I left your wallet in there,
and he didn't steal anything.

11:06.553 --> 11:07.581
Well, why didn't you use your wallet?

11:07.581 --> 11:08.605
- How'd you get...
- Would you focus?

11:08.606 --> 11:11.561
That guy is a good guy.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.749
Okay.

11:25.537 --> 11:27.564
Where'd you get a basketball?

11:27.565 --> 11:29.544
Mrs Marsh gave it to me.

11:29.545 --> 11:32.572
I thought you two might
like to have a play.

11:32.573 --> 11:35.516
You used to love basketball, Daniel.

11:35.517 --> 11:38.533
Yeah, well, I'm not a kid anymore.
I'm sorry, Mrs Marsh, that was rude.

11:39.589 --> 11:41.548
Damien, pros and cons.

11:41.549 --> 11:43.576
Pros, he lives here. He's cheap.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.552
He's got at least 25 toasters.

11:45.553 --> 11:47.512
Is that a pro?

11:47.513 --> 11:49.580
Cons, nothing. This is stupid.
Let's play basketball.

11:49.581 --> 11:50.585
Em...

11:50.586 --> 11:52.516
What have you got against hoarders?

11:52.517 --> 11:53.717
Nothing. It's just...

11:54.545 --> 11:56.556
this is the first decision I've
ever made for the business.

11:56.557 --> 11:57.581
I want to make sure it's the right one.

11:57.582 --> 12:00.508
Did you call Greg to see if
he has a criminal record?

12:00.509 --> 12:02.508
Yes. And no.

12:02.509 --> 12:03.557
You did call him?

12:03.557 --> 12:04.601
Yeah. And no to the other bit.

12:04.602 --> 12:07.544
- About him having a record?
- Yes.

12:07.545 --> 12:08.589
Damien doesn't have a record?

12:08.590 --> 12:10.540
No, Damien doesn't have a record.

12:10.541 --> 12:11.597
See, by saying such a short
answer at the start,

12:11.598 --> 12:13.560
it's your fault this
interaction took so long.

12:13.561 --> 12:15.544
He's just trying to follow
in his dad's footsteps

12:15.545 --> 12:16.577
and everyone is against him.

12:16.578 --> 12:18.529
Remind you of anyone?

12:19.525 --> 12:21.552
Yeah, you're right. I'll call him.

12:21.553 --> 12:23.580
Besides, Olive and the
Neighbourhood Watch

12:23.581 --> 12:25.536
can't tell me how to
run my own business.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.588
I'll book a meeting
with them at the pub.

12:27.589 --> 12:30.524
Now you're sounding like a Sir Boss.

12:30.525 --> 12:32.516
- You should get a briefcase.
- I'll get two briefcases.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.917
You'll need two briefcases to
hold all your mother's respect.

12:54.597 --> 12:57.528
This is crazy. How many people are
there in the Neighbourhood Watch?

12:57.529 --> 12:59.596
Oh, heaps. Olive's very
passionate about it.

12:59.597 --> 13:02.552
She's very persuasive about memberships.

13:02.553 --> 13:03.597
And you're sure Damien's trustworthy?

13:03.598 --> 13:06.592
Oh, yeah, no problems at all.
His dad was great.

13:06.593 --> 13:09.605
Really kind, generous.
Olive's just being Olive.

13:11.517 --> 13:12.517
Damien's a good kid.

13:12.517 --> 13:13.569
Right.

13:13.570 --> 13:16.549
Course it could just mean
he never got caught.

13:17.553 --> 13:18.593
Thanks, Dave.

13:18.594 --> 13:20.592
Hey, great blazer.

13:20.593 --> 13:22.521
You can't have it back, Ruby.

13:29.549 --> 13:30.749
Hi.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.532
Grace, hi.

13:33.533 --> 13:36.536
Um, are you in the
Neighbourhood Watch too?

13:36.537 --> 13:37.589
No, and I normally avoid the meetings,

13:37.590 --> 13:39.580
but I heard you'll be
standing up to Olive.

13:39.581 --> 13:41.576
Oh, not really standing up to her...

13:41.577 --> 13:43.604
You'll be great, if
you do a good speech.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.509
Thanks.

13:46.533 --> 13:52.528
Um... so do you come here, to this bar?

13:52.529 --> 13:53.545
I should have just said 'often'.

13:53.546 --> 13:55.512
I was trying to put my own spin on it.

13:55.513 --> 13:58.580
The pub? In the daytime? Not
usually, but maybe I should.

13:58.581 --> 14:00.572
Forming positive social relationships

14:00.573 --> 14:02.512
can increase a person's lifespan

14:02.513 --> 14:04.556
to an equal or greater extent
than physical exercise.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.536
I try and do both.

14:06.537 --> 14:09.556
Oh, Dan, Dan... Gez has got
this metal detector and...

14:09.557 --> 14:11.568
Hi, Grace... and Daniel, talking.

14:11.569 --> 14:13.592
- Hi.
- You know Gez.

14:13.593 --> 14:15.524
Yes. Hey, Gez.

14:15.525 --> 14:16.601
- Welcome back, Danny.
- Daniel.

14:16.602 --> 14:19.581
I hear you're having a lot
of sex on the mainland.

14:21.517 --> 14:22.569
Come on, we should probably get started.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.509
Oh...

14:28.601 --> 14:30.560
You ready?

14:30.561 --> 14:32.564
Can't I just tell them all individually?

14:32.565 --> 14:35.561
No. Just read out your statement.
I'll be right here.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.528
Okay.

14:39.529 --> 14:41.520
Ooh, do you want me to
do a joke at the start?

14:41.521 --> 14:42.597
- Warm the crowd up?
- What's the joke?

14:42.598 --> 14:44.568
- It involves the C-word.
- No.

14:44.569 --> 14:45.577
Your loss.

14:45.578 --> 14:47.552
- Here we go.
- Wait, wait, wait...

14:47.553 --> 14:49.568
Ting, ting, ting, ting,
ting, ting, ting!

15:01.513 --> 15:02.713
Hi. Um...

15:09.557 --> 15:12.560
Uh, hi. Thank you for... for coming.

15:12.561 --> 15:16.508
Firstly I'd like to thank Dave
for letting us use the pub today.

15:16.509 --> 15:18.553
No worries, you can pay me at the end.

15:19.569 --> 15:21.528
Sorry? Pay? Why?

15:21.529 --> 15:23.524
You've displaced my regular customers.

15:23.525 --> 15:26.520
- We are your regular customers.
- Shut up, Phil.

15:26.521 --> 15:28.584
Are we having this
meeting or not, Danny?

15:28.585 --> 15:31.509
Daniel. Yes.

15:34.577 --> 15:35.577
I understand

15:35.578 --> 15:38.556
you don't, uh, want Damien Nedbits
to take over as locksmith.

15:38.557 --> 15:40.537
- Correct.
- Right.

15:41.549 --> 15:45.596
Well, I have it on good authority
that Damien is an upstanding citizen

15:45.597 --> 15:48.584
and fully capable of
performing this position,

15:48.585 --> 15:51.545
as confirmed by Officer Greg Hardwick.

15:54.589 --> 15:56.540
He's in the toilet.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.557
I still don't trust him.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.585
His dad was the last locksmith.

15:58.586 --> 16:00.604
- I... don't... care.
- No, no.

16:00.605 --> 16:03.604
Em's right. He's just trying to
take over the family business.

16:03.605 --> 16:07.512
We're not going to stop him doing it.

16:07.513 --> 16:08.713
In fact...

16:10.521 --> 16:13.536
McCallum Real Estate will
be using his services

16:13.537 --> 16:15.577
for all our locksmithing
and handyman needs.

16:16.557 --> 16:18.512
If he...

16:26.533 --> 16:29.552
Fine. But if he screws
up, it's your head.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.508
Well, that's a bit dramatic.

16:31.509 --> 16:32.565
And as a gesture of goodwill,

16:32.566 --> 16:35.508
we are willing to allow
you to buy us a drink

16:35.509 --> 16:36.545
to consolidate the agreement.

16:38.549 --> 16:42.544
Okay, well, one each, and beer only.

16:42.545 --> 16:45.537
- I'll try a sangria, Dave.
- Me too!

17:00.585 --> 17:03.512
We should have beer work
meetings in pubs every day.

17:03.513 --> 17:05.540
Yeah, don't get used to it.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.579
Thank you for choosing McCallum
Real Estate. This is Daniel.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.536
Bloody long intro.

17:09.537 --> 17:11.588
- Hi, Mum. How are you?
- Bored.

17:11.589 --> 17:15.536
Waiting to go into surgery. It's
taking forever. What's the latest?

17:15.537 --> 17:17.528
Are there ants in the kitchenette?

17:17.529 --> 17:19.509
- No.
- Good.

17:20.553 --> 17:23.568
Hey, I tried to get into
the online banking today,

17:23.569 --> 17:25.584
and I think you might have forgotten
to give me the password.

17:25.585 --> 17:27.548
You don't need it.

17:27.549 --> 17:29.512
No... Well, I do...

17:29.513 --> 17:31.556
No, you don't need to
look into the banking.

17:31.557 --> 17:32.581
Mum, I'm not embezzling...

17:32.582 --> 17:35.520
Just answer the phone
and stay out of the finances.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.601
I'll fix it when I'm back.

17:36.602 --> 17:38.537
Fix it?

17:39.569 --> 17:43.516
Finally! Only 30 minutes late.
Is that a record for you guys?

17:43.517 --> 17:44.585
I gotta go.

17:47.509 --> 17:48.709
Love you...

18:30.561 --> 18:32.564
What's going on?

18:32.565 --> 18:34.576
Hi, mate!

18:34.577 --> 18:36.533
Oh, check it out.

18:37.521 --> 18:38.549
Jean hat!

18:38.550 --> 18:40.556
Gez, who knows everything
about everyone, by the way,

18:40.557 --> 18:43.524
said the previous owner
got his foot run over by a tractor,

18:43.525 --> 18:44.537
but after he got rid of the hat,

18:44.537 --> 18:45.737
so I figure it's good luck.

18:46.549 --> 18:48.548
Are you... okay?

18:48.549 --> 18:49.569
Yeah!

18:49.570 --> 18:51.596
It's just you're rummaging through
a bunch of garbage bags

18:51.597 --> 18:53.516
in the middle of the night.

18:54.546 --> 18:56.556
Mum won't stop calling,
asking how the honeymoon's going,

18:56.557 --> 18:58.576
and I don't know enough about Bali
to keep lying to her,

18:58.577 --> 19:01.548
so I've started telling her
population stats from Wikipedia.

19:01.549 --> 19:03.508
- Well, just tell her you're here.
- No!

19:03.509 --> 19:04.581
I don't want to deal with it.
That's why I'm here.

19:04.582 --> 19:07.525
Oh, saucepan clock!

19:08.549 --> 19:09.581
I'll be fine. Go back to bed.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.560
No, I... can't sleep either.

19:12.561 --> 19:14.557
- Bladder problems?
- No.

19:15.577 --> 19:20.564
I just... I don't think the business
is in as good a shape as Mum let on.

19:20.565 --> 19:22.568
She wouldn't give me
the banking password.

19:22.569 --> 19:25.520
Oh. How bad is it?

19:25.521 --> 19:26.549
I don't know,

19:26.550 --> 19:29.585
but I'm assuming if she won't
let me look, it's in the red.

19:31.573 --> 19:32.577
Is that the good one?

19:32.577 --> 19:33.581
Hmm?

19:33.582 --> 19:35.592
I never know if in the red
or in the black is good.

19:35.593 --> 19:38.532
- They both sound bad.
- Red... red is bad.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.549
- Red is bad.
- Red is bad.

19:39.550 --> 19:40.950
- What's green?
- There is no green.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.597
Okay. Honestly, what do you think?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.604
It's... gooooood.

19:50.605 --> 19:52.525
It's for you.

20:00.513 --> 20:02.532
- The hat was a joke.
- Oh, thank God.

20:04.585 --> 20:06.524
Mrs Marsh put new batteries in.

20:06.525 --> 20:08.576
Hi, Greg! Are you okay?

20:08.577 --> 20:12.552
Uh, yeah. Just a bit of a... mob.

20:12.553 --> 20:14.516
A mob?

20:14.517 --> 20:16.536
Yeah, when people
got home after the meeting,

20:16.537 --> 20:18.512
they noticed stuff was missing,

20:18.513 --> 20:21.600
and... Olive did a ring-around
and now they're all blaming Damien.

20:21.601 --> 20:24.532
- Oh, no.
- What stuff?

20:24.533 --> 20:27.540
Oh, appliances, tools, bits and pieces.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.568
Nothing worth that much,
but they're furious.

20:29.569 --> 20:33.552
And now they've gone around there
to give it to him... get it from him.

20:33.553 --> 20:35.596
Well, both, really. It could get nasty.

20:35.597 --> 20:38.588
I need you to come and talk 'em down.

20:38.589 --> 20:40.604
Yeah, let's go!
You've got the police on your side.

20:40.605 --> 20:42.512
One.

20:42.513 --> 20:43.545
Yeah, but he's got a gun, right, Greg?

20:43.545 --> 20:44.553
I wish.

20:44.554 --> 20:46.580
Hang on, Greg, can't you have a
first pass at sorting it out

20:46.581 --> 20:48.508
and then come and grab me if you need?

20:48.509 --> 20:49.553
- Come on. This is our fault.
- Our fault?

20:49.553 --> 20:50.597
- You did vouch for him.
- So did you!

20:50.598 --> 20:54.512
I think they could be headed here
next unless we get it sorted.

20:54.513 --> 20:56.564
Shotgun front seat!

20:56.565 --> 21:00.532
All right, just let me get my... I
don't know what you bring to a mob.

21:00.533 --> 21:01.733
Let's go.

21:10.605 --> 21:12.576
Show yourself, please!

21:12.577 --> 21:15.512
Damien Nedbits,
get out here now!

21:15.513 --> 21:16.713
Come on!

21:18.565 --> 21:20.552
Come out and deny it!

21:20.553 --> 21:23.604
Say you haven't been breaking into
our homes and stealing our things!

21:23.605 --> 21:27.512
I want my footbath! 
My feet are disgusting!

21:27.513 --> 21:29.560
Arrest him!

21:29.561 --> 21:32.524
Please return to your homes.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.561
Oh, stay out of it, Greg.

21:35.565 --> 21:36.577
I did what I could.

21:36.578 --> 21:39.540
I can talk to him. 
We understand each other.

21:39.541 --> 21:41.600
Did he just go through a break-up too?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.528
What?

21:43.529 --> 21:45.512
Oh, I heard about the honeymoon stuff.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.601
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

21:46.602 --> 21:49.548
Though to be fair,
 I'm usually the last one told.

21:49.549 --> 21:51.521
- I didn't tell anyone.
- I know.

22:00.565 --> 22:02.512
Hi, guys.

22:02.513 --> 22:03.601
- Can we come in?
- Sure.

22:03.602 --> 22:05.589
Sorry about the honeymoon.

22:07.557 --> 22:08.561
Yeah, so you know

22:08.562 --> 22:10.544
how there's a group of angry people
on your front lawn?

22:10.545 --> 22:12.540
- Yeah.
- I feel like I should join them, okay?

22:12.541 --> 22:14.528
- I stood up for you...
- Thanks, mate.

22:14.529 --> 22:15.541
No, I shouldn't have,

22:15.541 --> 22:16.605
because you broke into
their houses and took...

22:16.606 --> 22:18.508
No, he didn't take anything!

22:18.509 --> 22:19.589
- No, I did.
- Dammit.

22:21.565 --> 22:23.544
Damien, is everything in there stolen?

22:23.545 --> 22:25.525
Oh, no, I didn't steal anything.

22:28.557 --> 22:30.556
You're an apologist for
the establishment.

22:30.557 --> 22:35.544
Settle down, everybody. Just...
just... settle down.

22:35.545 --> 22:37.572
- Really!
- Just piss off, Greg.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.525
Now, I know you don't mean that.

22:41.553 --> 22:42.753
I'll leave you to it.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.588
Did you fire him? Send him out.

22:47.589 --> 22:50.532
Listen, he did take some stuff...

22:50.533 --> 22:51.557
- Uh...
- I knew it!

22:51.558 --> 22:53.588
- No, no, let me finish.
- Wait till Barbara hears about this.

22:53.589 --> 22:56.533
No, no, no, he only took the stuff
his dad loaned to all of you.

22:57.509 --> 22:58.517
The stuff you never gave back.

22:58.517 --> 22:59.541
What?

22:59.542 --> 23:01.524
Well, the stuff you never returned,
like...

23:01.525 --> 23:02.725
Olive.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.564
You've had his dad's
lawnmower since 2010.

23:06.565 --> 23:09.600
No, I got that mower from...

23:09.601 --> 23:11.597
Frank? Where's Frank?

23:12.565 --> 23:13.605
Frank, it's been three and a half years.

23:13.606 --> 23:15.576
You must have watched the
Godfather DVDs by now.

23:15.577 --> 23:18.532
Not the third one. I've been flat out.

23:18.533 --> 23:19.561
And Phil?

23:19.562 --> 23:23.548
You've had his dad's fishing
rod, fold-up chair, esky...

23:23.549 --> 23:26.516
He wasn't using any of that stuff.

23:26.517 --> 23:29.117
Well, I'm gonna go off script and
say that's because you had them.

23:29.561 --> 23:32.525
Ruby, you've had his
blender for a year now.

23:32.605 --> 23:33.805
Steve? Where's Steve?

23:34.565 --> 23:36.532
And in here, just sponges.

23:36.533 --> 23:37.733
Never been wet.

23:38.593 --> 23:40.572
You must be so mad at them.

23:40.573 --> 23:42.580
I don't really get mad.
It gives me headaches.

23:42.581 --> 23:44.545
I do. Bloody Gez!

23:45.513 --> 23:46.557
Now everyone knows.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.557
Yeah, but now everyone knows.

23:50.569 --> 23:51.581
Want to fill up the bath

23:51.582 --> 23:54.528
and see if we can absorb all the
water if we tip these sponges in?

23:54.529 --> 23:55.729
Yes, please.

23:58.577 --> 24:00.584
Damien's dad was one of the most
generous people in Rosehaven

24:00.585 --> 24:02.536
and you all took advantage.

24:02.537 --> 24:04.532
You knew he wasn't going to ask
for any of that stuff back.

24:04.533 --> 24:07.516
Hang on, he's still trespassing
on private property.

24:07.517 --> 24:08.581
Oh, shut up, Olive.

24:08.582 --> 24:10.521
Good one, Phil.

24:22.589 --> 24:25.552
Good to see someone
finally stand up to Olive.

24:25.553 --> 24:27.596
- Hi.
- She's a difficult patient.

24:27.597 --> 24:30.524
Keeps bringing me handouts
from the internet

24:30.525 --> 24:32.560
and saying, "I have this, fix it."

24:32.561 --> 24:34.605
Yeah, she's... she's
tricky to deal with.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.524
I didn't think real estate would
involve so many speeches.

24:38.525 --> 24:40.576
- Oh, I'm freezing. Let's go.
- Hi, Grace!

24:40.577 --> 24:42.552
- What happened?
- Sponge fight.

24:42.553 --> 24:44.520
Well, don't get in the car like that!

24:44.521 --> 24:46.521
Oh...

24:55.577 --> 24:57.548
312 sponges?

24:57.549 --> 24:58.593
Give or take.

24:58.594 --> 25:02.528
I'm glad you were keeping busy while
I was dealing with an angry mob.

25:02.529 --> 25:03.729
I was on my break.

25:05.565 --> 25:08.560
Why are you so upset? We did good.

25:08.561 --> 25:10.560
Is it the banking stuff?

25:10.561 --> 25:13.512
Yeah. I just wish Mum'd
tell me what's going on.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.512
She will. She's probably just...

25:15.513 --> 25:17.536
- Insert good reason.
- That's pretty lazy.

25:17.537 --> 25:19.513
Sorry.

25:24.553 --> 25:25.753
You gonna tell her?

25:27.537 --> 25:30.589
Might as well. Gez has
probably already told her.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.521
Aloha!

25:37.561 --> 25:38.597
I'm good, Mum.

25:38.598 --> 25:40.564
Um, listen, just quickly...

25:40.565 --> 25:42.600
uh... so I'm not in Bali.

25:42.601 --> 25:44.544
We broke up.

25:44.545 --> 25:47.513
I'm in Tasmania with Daniel and
I'm going to stay here for now.

25:52.601 --> 25:55.528
That's not true. I've done
heaps more immature things.

25:55.529 --> 25:56.729
Okay, I've gotta go. Bye.

26:04.593 --> 26:08.588
Hey, if I get this in,

26:08.589 --> 26:11.604
everything works out
brilliantly for both of us,

26:11.605 --> 26:14.540
personally and financially,

26:14.541 --> 26:17.577
and all our wildest dreams come true.

26:18.569 --> 26:19.769
You got this.
