WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.909
I told you
I really don't think

00:03.969 --> 00:05.381
you should wear a necktie.

00:05.438 --> 00:06.849
Well, all right.

00:06.906 --> 00:08.977
Okay, everybody, latest poll

00:09.042 --> 00:13.422
is Newport 40%, Leslie 32%
with everyone else way back.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.461
Now, this debate is our best
chance to close that gap.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.393
Chris, Ann and Tom,
you guys will be

00:18.451 --> 00:20.158
talking to reporters,
providing facts.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.255
General spin.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.697
Spin team!

00:22.822 --> 00:25.166
This is the best
possible job for me.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.501
I can literally make
anything sound positive.

00:27.594 --> 00:28.971
Your house just burned down

00:29.029 --> 00:30.940
and you lost all your money
in the stock market.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.840
It's a chance to start over,
fire is cleansing,

00:32.899 --> 00:35.209
and true wealth is measured by
the amount of love in your life.

00:35.268 --> 00:39.114
If I had to have anybody
tell me that I had cancer,

00:40.206 --> 00:41.514
I would want it to be me.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.144
Ron, April and Andy,
you'll be throwing

00:43.209 --> 00:44.552
a party for our
biggest donors.

00:44.611 --> 00:47.148
Are they big, big?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.250
They're rich people that
gave money to the campaign.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.591
I hope they don't expect us
to have an elevator

00:51.651 --> 00:53.858
or, like, caramels.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.263
I don't know
about rich people.

00:55.321 --> 00:56.823
I was preparing for big people.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.392
Is the menu all set?

00:58.458 --> 01:01.462
Yes, I will be
providing several slabs

01:01.528 --> 01:03.371
of my world-famous
Swanson ribs.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.570
And I will be providing my world-famous
hundred-dollar lap dances.

01:06.633 --> 01:07.771
Sweet.
No.

01:07.834 --> 01:12.214
Okay. The election is in two weeks.
The debate is in nine hours.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.042
Let's get to work.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.553
Yeah!

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

01:37.163 --> 01:38.164
Wow!

01:38.465 --> 01:40.445
I can't believe
we're doing this here.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.036
This seats, like, 800 people.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.308
Well, that's what
you get when

01:43.369 --> 01:45.815
your opponent is the most
famous person in town.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.310
This is a lot bigger than my
high school debate auditorium.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.013
Did you know I played
Peter Pan in high school?

01:51.077 --> 01:52.954
I can't picture it.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.924
Four feet. Exact same
size as the podium

01:55.982 --> 01:57.484
you use in
the Parks Department.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.120
Opening statement.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.461
I am Leslie Knope
and I love this town,

02:01.521 --> 02:03.660
and I've worked my whole life
to make it great.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.168
I believe that
I've earned your vote.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.898
Bobby Newport believes
he can buy it.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.405
You got this.
I got this.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.973
You could debate
Newport in your sleep.

02:10.029 --> 02:11.064
I have.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.111
I know. We sleep in the same bed.
It's been hell.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.911
When I was 18
and ran for mayor,

02:14.968 --> 02:17.312
I was way behind
going into the debates.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.407
And I crushed my opponent.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.951
It's why I won.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.577
That and the fact
that I threw a bunch

02:22.642 --> 02:25.122
of Day-Glow Ray-Bans
into the crowd.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.590
It was 1993.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.526
My dad managed a sunglass hut.
Not a big deal.

02:30.683 --> 02:33.095
I finally get a chance to
stand in front of everyone

02:33.153 --> 02:35.463
and talk about
the town that I love.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.192
What if the town
loves Bobby more than me?

02:37.257 --> 02:39.635
There's no way.
You're going to destroy him.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.103
I'm going to wipe
the floor with his face.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.334
You're going to rip out his
spine with your teeth,

02:43.396 --> 02:45.808
and then chew it up
and gargle with it.

02:46.132 --> 02:47.907
I love it when
you're needlessly disgusting.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.271
Hey! You can't be in here.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.714
The debate doesn't start
for another seven hours.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.649
Sorry, we're leaving.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.212
Leslie Knope!

02:59.112 --> 03:00.614
I'm trying to
clean up for the party,

03:00.680 --> 03:03.251
but I swear to God, my
arms can't move that way.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.354
Leave it messy. It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.524
Life is garbage.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.090
What happened?

03:10.156 --> 03:12.762
Ann broke up with me.
For reals this time.

03:12.992 --> 03:15.199
And all I did was call
in to this radio station

03:15.261 --> 03:16.638
and give her
a sweet little shout-out.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.766
So, we're up in the club.

03:17.830 --> 03:18.831
It's me.

03:18.898 --> 03:22.243
We're <i>dancing.</i> We're <i>sweating Let's
just say,</i> we <i>got to second that night.</i>

03:22.302 --> 03:23.576
Kind of.

03:23.636 --> 03:24.808
Me so horny.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.782
This chick's name
is Ann Perkins.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.479
Look her up on the government website.
She is crazy hot.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.112
Isn't that great? Come here.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.422
I complimented you.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.560
I guess she's just afraid of
how powerful her feelings are.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.426
Dude, that's not why
she broke up with you.

03:39.485 --> 03:40.759
I really like her.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.821
Well, does she know that?

03:41.888 --> 03:44.926
The whole town knows it.
I live my life out loud.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.232
Dude, you have to
stop your stupid swagger

03:47.293 --> 03:50.206
and just tell her, in a normal
voice, that you care about her.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.209
What do you know?
You don't care about things.

03:52.265 --> 03:56.577
Yes, I do. I care about
Andy and Champion.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.310
And I want Leslie to win.
And I like sleeping.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.310
So, everybody has
things they care about.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.355
If Ann is yours,
you need to tell her.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.791
Hey. You guys all set?

04:09.849 --> 04:11.522
Ann, you have all
the facts you need?

04:11.584 --> 04:12.824
Totally. Listen to this.

04:12.885 --> 04:16.196
The average human grows 50 feet
of hair in their lifetime.

04:16.789 --> 04:17.961
That's really interesting.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.163
How about some facts
we can use in the debate?

04:20.226 --> 04:22.137
Yeah. No, I have those, too.
But you have to admit

04:22.195 --> 04:24.072
that the human body is amazing.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.165
I say it all the time.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.268
I have been researching
facts about Pawnee

04:27.333 --> 04:30.644
and sometimes I just get sucked
into an Internet rabbit hole.

04:30.737 --> 04:34.344
And next thing I know, I'm
looking up how slugs have sex.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.812
It's weirdly beautiful.
YouTube it.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.050
Okay, Chris.
Hypothetical crisis.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.888
Leslie just tried
to answer a question

04:41.948 --> 04:45.020
and audibly farted,
then threw up. Spin.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.655
Leslie Knope is
literally overflowing

04:47.720 --> 04:49.324
with ideas for this town.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.697
And speaking of methane,

04:50.757 --> 04:53.033
have you heard about her plan to
limit greenhouse gas emissions?

04:53.092 --> 04:54.435
Wow.
Nice.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.768
Spin team!

04:55.828 --> 04:57.865
Ann and I make
such a great team.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.035
It's silly that
we're not a team in real life.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.441
I just heard those words
come out of my mouth,

05:01.501 --> 05:02.639
and I have made a decision.

05:03.036 --> 05:06.643
I've heard that
you and Tom Haverford

05:06.706 --> 05:08.982
are no longer romantically involved.
Is that true?

05:09.208 --> 05:11.017
Yes, we broke up.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.683
And I honestly
can't believe we ever dated.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.353
It does defy logic.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.953
I still have
feelings for you.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.192
Strong feelings.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.998
Emotional, primal feelings.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.204
And I would like to give
our relationship another try.

05:28.428 --> 05:32.103
Chris. We dated for, like,
three months, a year ago.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.610
And you broke up with me.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.341
I honestly think that you've built
this into something that it wasn't.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.041
And according to your rule, we
can't date because you're my boss.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.553
Maybe not for long.
If Newport wins,

05:43.609 --> 05:44.883
the City Council
may replace me.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.582
But it would open it up
for us to be together.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.892
Would you like that?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.019
Don't answer.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.294
Just think about it.
Come on. Let's spin.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.101
So, you do
a lot of investing?

06:03.162 --> 06:04.641
We like to dabble.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.440
I recently invested in some
shirts at a garage sale.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.947
I left them at Wendy's
on the way home.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.011
The economy.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.881
Excited for the debate?

06:18.945 --> 06:22.688
I don't believe in debates I think
there should be less talking.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.956
In politics?
In life.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.565
Do it.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.036
Fierce. Power.
Pump it up. 2012.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.404
Go... Okay, sorry.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.171
Nothing gets
me more amped than Sarah McLachan.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.234
Opening statement.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.109
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town,

06:43.169 --> 06:44.443
and I've worked my whole
life to make it great.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.574
I believe that
I've earned your vote.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.879
Bobby Newport believes
he can buy it.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.647
I have the best campaign
manager in the world.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.683
I wouldn't say that
Jen's a killer.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.281
You can beat Newport. I don't
know if I can beat her.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.161
Here's what I know.
I love you and I like you.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.889
I love you and I like you.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.022
Oh, hey.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.731
Do you maybe wanna go pay
Newport a little visit?

07:03.790 --> 07:07.328
Ben and I are about to pull the
oldest debate team trick in the book.

07:07.393 --> 07:08.633
Before we all
go out on stage,

07:08.694 --> 07:11.504
we're going to storm into
Newport's room unannounced

07:11.564 --> 07:13.635
and wish him luck.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.303
So if you need to find me,

07:15.368 --> 07:17.245
I'll be in
Bobby Newport's head.

07:17.303 --> 07:20.978
Hey, Bobby. I just wanted to say...
I can't do this.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.044
It's too hard. I'm too scared.
Please don't make me.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.282
Someone's having a moment.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.190
For like three weeks I've
been trying to figure out

07:33.252 --> 07:35.254
ways to make things
better in this town.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.323
You guys,
there's so many problems.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.767
Somebody needs to
fix these problems.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.998
Bobby, take a deep breath.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.569
Remember what we talked about?
Yeah, don't be myself.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.906
Be a smarter version
of yourself.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.240
And a person
with less feelings.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.975
I just want to take a nap.
Can't we cancel this thing?

07:51.070 --> 07:52.515
No, we can't.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.209
Can we call in
a bomb threat?

07:54.273 --> 07:56.753
My dad did that once when I didn't
want to go to my lacrosse game.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.283
What's going on in there?
Is this some kind of trick?

08:03.349 --> 08:06.023
You got to cancel it. I broke my foot.
No. He's a disaster.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.792
Okay. What do we do.
Should I back off?

08:07.854 --> 08:09.026
I don't want to
come across as a bully.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.932
No. Same game plan.
You go on the offensive.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.868
And if he's reeling,
all the better.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.735
You land an early
knock-out punch.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.469
Your boxing metaphors
are beyond sexy.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.943
All righty, folks. One minute.
Thank you, Lorenzo.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.807
Hello.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.873
You are here
because you gave us money.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.544
Now, we will give you ribs.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.483
Also, you will
watch the debate.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.080
If you like the debate,
you'll give us more money.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.587
That is all. Ron Swanson.

08:38.784 --> 08:39.818
Uh oh.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.729
Somebody forgot to
pay the cable bill.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.668
Am I right?

08:45.725 --> 08:46.760
It was me.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.028
What can we expect
from tonight's debate?

08:49.095 --> 08:51.006
Prepared statements
from Bobby Newport,

08:51.063 --> 08:53.202
impassioned answers
from Leslie Knope.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.873
But Bobby Newport is super
handsome and charming,

08:56.936 --> 08:59.542
so, that means people
will probably vote for him

08:59.605 --> 09:01.778
because there's no
justice in the world.

09:04.911 --> 09:11.795
And the home of the brave

09:21.460 --> 09:24.737
Good evening, everyone, and welcome
to the event we are doing tonight,

09:24.797 --> 09:29.212
which is a City Council candidate
debate that we're going to start now.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.440
I'm Perd Hapley.

09:30.503 --> 09:34.815
And I am legendary newswoman,
Joan Callamezzo, newly single.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.218
It's time for
opening statements.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.584
I am Fester Trim.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.815
Many of you know me as the
man who sells you your guns

09:41.881 --> 09:44.794
at the Gun-believable Gun Emporium.
Whoo!

09:44.850 --> 09:47.922
I want to tell you
about my idea

09:47.987 --> 09:51.264
for assault rifle
vending machines.

09:52.224 --> 09:55.000
Is he going to be okay?
Who?

09:55.528 --> 09:59.704
Bobby. He'll be fine.
Expectations are crazy low.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.045
If he puts two sentences
together without crying,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.081
the press is going to say
he's doing surprisingly well.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.809
And if he falls to pieces, he's
going to look sympathetic.

10:05.871 --> 10:06.906
It's a win-win.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.884
So, do you have any idea how
long this is going to take?

10:08.941 --> 10:10.079
You might bethinking,

10:10.142 --> 10:13.180
"What does an adult film star
know about politics?"

10:13.245 --> 10:17.819
Well, I produced and starred in over
400 adult films this year alone.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.118
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.528
And just like Leslie,

10:20.586 --> 10:23.658
I know what it's like to be the
only woman in a room full of men.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.566
I am Manrico Della Rossa.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.731
I believe animals are
as important as people.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.172
And if elected,
I will fight for them

10:31.230 --> 10:33.141
as if they are
my own children.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.109
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town,

10:36.168 --> 10:38.546
and I've worked my whole life
to make it great.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.906
I believe that
I've earned your vote.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.214
Bobby Newport
believes he can buy it.

10:43.309 --> 10:47.451
And maybe that's because he's never
earned anything his entire life.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.451
Wow. Come on.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.257
That hurt my feelings.
Hurt my feelings.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.060
You're supposed to be
this positive person.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.725
Can't we just talk
about things we like?

10:58.824 --> 10:59.996
Well said.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.370
Just a reminder to our
candidates to keep it civil.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.834
I'm looking at you, Leslie.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.968
That's okay, Joan.
I'm okay. I'm just...

11:09.035 --> 11:11.675
I'm nervous, man. I'm nervous.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.808
I guess I want
to do a good job.

11:13.873 --> 11:17.116
Because I like it when people
think I do a good job.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.985
And I want your vote because
I want Pawnee and my dad

11:20.046 --> 11:21.650
to see what I'm made of.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.718
So, let's do this.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.994
The wrecking crew!
Who let you guys in?

11:30.756 --> 11:31.757
Hey, Jason.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.295
Ease back.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.869
I can't get through to the cable company.
Can you do something?

11:40.933 --> 11:41.934
Like what?

11:42.768 --> 11:44.839
Anything?
Andy is just acting out

11:44.904 --> 11:46.042
scenes from his
favorite movies.

11:47.506 --> 11:51.249
So, Swayze runs. Boom! Tackles
the guy off the motorcycle.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.414
Dude's like,
"You're dead, bro."

11:52.478 --> 11:55.391
Comes at him.
Swayze ducks. Scissor kick.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.325
The guy holds
Swayze's head and he says,

11:57.383 --> 11:59.556
"I used to  guys
like you in prison."

11:59.618 --> 12:03.122
By the looks of this guy, this is not
consensual sex we're talking about.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.227
We see bad guy
had a gun the whole time.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.327
He's like,

12:07.393 --> 12:09.202
"I'm going to kill you
the old-fashioned way."

12:09.261 --> 12:10.968
Swayze's like,
"Not this time."

12:11.030 --> 12:12.475
That's subtext.
He doesn't say that.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.977
Bypasses the gun,
hooks the arm,

12:15.034 --> 12:17.071
back to the secret move he
used before to kill somebody.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.444
He feels so bad
about it, but this time,

12:18.504 --> 12:20.814
he has to do it because
it's self-defense.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.512
Takes the esophagus
out of the neck area.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.716
You can't eat.
You'll starve to death.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.918
And that is Road House.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.322
What should I do next?

12:30.649 --> 12:33.892
This question about public
safety comes from Twitter,

12:33.953 --> 12:37.059
because apparently, that's
something that happens now.

12:37.389 --> 12:40.233
@munchmeat2015 asks,

12:40.292 --> 12:42.203
"Pawnee used to be safe.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.639
"Someone stole my car.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.337
"What will you do
to make Pawnee safe,

12:47.399 --> 12:49.208
"and can you help
me find my car?"

12:49.335 --> 12:50.871
I can assure you.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.284
If you had a gun
mounted on the dashboard

12:54.373 --> 12:57.843
which automatically shot people
trying to break into it,

12:57.910 --> 12:59.651
you would still have your car.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.683
You know, I guess I would
like to tell Mr. Munchmeat

13:02.748 --> 13:04.955
that I think that stinks
that happened to him.

13:05.017 --> 13:08.157
You know, one time, a guy stole
some downhill skis out of my Jeep

13:08.220 --> 13:11.258
and I was so mad,
I punched a mailbox.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.304
I'm against crime, and I'm
not ashamed to admit it.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.368
This question is about
Pawnee's park system.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.743
Why is Ramsett Park
so filthy and awful?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.010
It's difficult to get into

13:26.071 --> 13:29.848
the complicated problems with Ramsett
Park in such a short amount of time.

13:29.909 --> 13:30.979
You have 20 seconds.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.786
Oh, my God. Okay. I will say
that the parks in Pawnee are...

13:34.847 --> 13:37.760
I do have an update
on your time allotment.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.661
And that update is that
your time is almost gone.

13:40.719 --> 13:41.789
I have no more time left?

13:41.854 --> 13:44.562
Well, you had some time
when I started talking.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.694
But by the time I finished
your time was up.

13:46.759 --> 13:47.829
Thank you very much.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.236
She's off her game.
She's fine.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.706
Mr. Newport, rebuttal.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.710
I know this. If something is
dirty, we should clean it up.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.779
Let's start there. Right?

13:58.103 --> 14:01.414
You know what? I had this
cleaning lady named Yolanda

14:01.473 --> 14:02.975
who was very wise.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.578
She basically raised me.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.213
And one day, she said,

14:06.278 --> 14:09.418
"Little Bobby, I am not going
to clean your room no mas. "

14:09.481 --> 14:13.293
And from that day on, my room was gross.
Really bummed me out.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.424
I think we should make our
parks look like my room

14:16.488 --> 14:18.195
after Yolanda finally,
you know,

14:18.257 --> 14:19.827
gave in and
cleaned it up for me.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.805
If I may, Joan, that's a
very sweet story, Bobby.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.899
But not all of
us have Yolandas

14:24.964 --> 14:26.966
who can clean up
our room for us.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.103
Some of us believe that you
need to roll up your sleeves

14:29.168 --> 14:30.704
and do the
hard work yourself.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.478
Mr. Newport, your response.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.816
I'm glad I grew
up with Yolanda.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.617
She taught me
everything I know.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.147
In fact, Yo-Yo, if you're
watching I love you.

14:42.982 --> 14:45.292
I'm sorry I couldn't protect
you from Leslie's mean words.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.228
Look I have
no beef with Yo-Yo.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.493
I'd just like to say
that, like Leslie,

14:49.555 --> 14:51.159
I don't have people
do my work for me.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.533
Leslie and I do
our work ourselves.

14:53.692 --> 14:57.799
My work, of course, is having sex
with men and women on camera.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.668
Once again,
Brandi and Leslie

15:00.733 --> 15:02.770
are essentially
the same person.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.146
How do you respond
to Newport's claim

15:05.204 --> 15:06.740
that the city parks
need to be cleaned up?

15:06.805 --> 15:09.615
Pawnee parks were rated
in the Indiana top ten

15:09.675 --> 15:11.552
for cleanliness
and maintenance.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.750
78% of Pawneeans
label our parks, "pristine."

15:14.813 --> 15:17.020
And we all know
the better-looking a park is,

15:17.082 --> 15:19.494
the more attention
it will get from lady parks

15:19.551 --> 15:21.656
who want to have
sex with it.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.165
Excuse us.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.997
What the hell
is wrong with you?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.196
We're fighting for
our lives out there.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.535
Oh, I don't know. Maybe the
fact that we just broke up

15:29.595 --> 15:31.097
and you're already
riding the Traeger train.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.608
What are you
talking about?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.872
I saw you guys getting back together.
What about us?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.345
What about us, Tom?

15:36.402 --> 15:39.144
We're not together anymore because
you keep acting like an ass.

15:39.905 --> 15:43.250
I'm sorry. I just
act that way sometimes

15:43.309 --> 15:45.687
because I'm nervous

15:45.744 --> 15:47.746
and I feel like
you're out of my league.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.760
But I'd do anything to get
back together with you.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.261
Please.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.025
Vote for me
to be your boyfriend.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.594
Ben, he's winning.
How is he winning?

15:57.656 --> 16:00.102
Everything he's saying is
nonsense, and he's fooling them.

16:00.159 --> 16:01.229
Okay, you're doing fine.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.397
I need to go
back on the attack.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.906
No. No, no, no. See?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.136
Okay. When you attacked, you
kind of came off like a bully,

16:06.198 --> 16:07.268
and he looked sympathetic.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.836
So, you know, you did a really
good job of easing off.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.745
Leslie.
This is fun, isn't it?

16:11.837 --> 16:12.941
Yeah.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.076
Well, there's no reason
on earth that I can think of

16:15.140 --> 16:17.120
that we shouldn't have
concussion grenades

16:17.176 --> 16:19.087
in our nation's
movie theaters.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.383
It doesn't mean anything about
my stance on immigration.

16:21.447 --> 16:22.926
It just means
I love burritos.

16:23.615 --> 16:24.855
Daniel Craig.

16:25.217 --> 16:26.218
No.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.557
Timothy Dalton.

16:28.620 --> 16:33.899
And anyone who even rubs their
hands on a leather jacket

16:33.959 --> 16:35.870
should be tried for murder.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.939
Bachelor's degree. Princeton.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.477
I'm an American.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.068
My father is an American.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.738
My mother is an American.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.942
My godfather is the viceroy of the
Principality of Liechtenstein.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.247
Sure, I agree that
movies should be more

16:51.310 --> 16:52.948
faithful to the books
that they are based on,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.787
but what does that have
to do with this election?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.520
All my movies
are based on books.

16:56.582 --> 17:00.257
By the year 2013, we will have a
fully functional mall on Jupiter.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.193
Once again, people,

17:03.255 --> 17:04.256
grenade launcher.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.894
I guess my thoughts
on abortion are,

17:06.959 --> 17:08.733
you know, let’s just
all have a good time.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.807
I don't care about that issue.
Just ask someone else.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.901
No, I'm not a vegan.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.412
I am an onionarian.

17:16.468 --> 17:20.507
I only eat onions
and onion-based juices.

17:20.571 --> 17:23.519
Just to be clear, when you
talk about bigger government,

17:23.575 --> 17:25.851
are you talking
about the buildings?

17:27.311 --> 17:28.313
Pass.

17:28.614 --> 17:29.786
For the record,
I'd appear in a film

17:29.848 --> 17:31.987
with any of my
fellow candidates.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.097
Anteaters.
Kill shot.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.635
Money shot.
Fudgicles.

17:38.690 --> 17:39.998
I don't know, Liam Neeson.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.630
Ah, I should've said
Liam Neeson.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.867
Let's spend our money
on what matters.

17:44.930 --> 17:48.207
Police, fire,
parks and schools.

17:50.302 --> 17:53.249
After a rough start,
your girl's doing okay.

17:53.305 --> 17:55.581
I think she's doing
a little better than okay.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.678
Or did you miss
the applause she got

17:57.743 --> 17:58.949
on the raccoon
safety question?

17:59.011 --> 18:01.685
No, that was great. That probably
pulled her even with Bobby.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.651
I can't believe
you're so casual about this.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.286
Don't you even want
to win the debate?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.126
We're going to
win the debate.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.827
We've got an ace in the hole.
Little surprisey-wisey.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.925
What?
Oh, you'll see.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.026
Hey, quick question.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.731
Does that guy, Chris Traeger,
have a girlfriend?

18:15.794 --> 18:16.829
And is his penis normal?

18:16.895 --> 18:18.272
Stop talking.

18:18.497 --> 18:23.037
Open on villagers being
thrown out into a rice field.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.139
Land mines blowing
them up into pieces.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.274
A bad guy smoking cigarettes.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.684
After I steal this cable feed,
I will repay the cable company

18:30.742 --> 18:32.221
for the service we used.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.762
This last question before
the break is for Mr. Newport.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.633
Some, not me,
have criticized

18:44.690 --> 18:48.103
your involvement with your
father's candy company, Sweetums.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.231
Would your affiliation
with big business

18:50.295 --> 18:52.639
affect your decisions
as a City Councilor?

18:52.698 --> 18:55.201
I want to run this town
like a business.

18:55.267 --> 18:59.738
My opponent, Leslie Knope, has
a very anti-business agenda.

19:00.272 --> 19:03.776
Recently, my dad told me that if
Leslie Knope wins the election,

19:03.842 --> 19:06.823
they'll probably have to
move Sweetums to Mexico.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.627
That would be
terrible, of course.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.686
Thousands of people in this
town would lose their jobs,

19:13.752 --> 19:15.527
and we all
wouldn't have candy.

19:15.587 --> 19:19.000
Now, I'm not saying that is going to happen.
But I do know this.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.661
If I win...

19:21.393 --> 19:23.737
I bet I could
get them to stay.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.569
Shocking stuff.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.442
We're going to be back
with our closing statements

19:29.501 --> 19:31.947
right after a word
from our sponsor, Sweetums,

19:32.004 --> 19:34.883
Pawnee's biggest
supplier of candy and jobs.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.511
Stick around.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.858
So, Sweetums is going to move
to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win?

19:41.914 --> 19:44.588
How could they do that to this town?
What a crappy stunt to pull.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.651
One minute back.

19:45.717 --> 19:46.718
Shut up, Lorenzo.
Shut up, Lorenzo.

19:46.785 --> 19:47.820
What do we do?

19:47.886 --> 19:49.593
I think we attack him.
He's more confident now.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.725
I have to attack him.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.269
And say what? We didn't plan for this.
What would you even say?

19:53.325 --> 19:55.100
I don't know. I'll figure
it out as I'm saying it.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.197
Just let me attack him.
I want to attack him.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.900
No. No, no, no.
It's too risky.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.807
Just go with the closing
statement we rehearsed,

20:00.866 --> 20:02.709
add a line at the end about
how you're pro-business,

20:02.768 --> 20:05.044
and we'll deal with the
fallout tomorrow. Okay?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.117
What?
What's the matter with you?

20:09.374 --> 20:10.546
I can do it.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.283
I can crush him.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.219
I promise.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.457
Screw it. Go get him.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.655
Really?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.057
Kick his ass.

20:22.721 --> 20:28.000
lam a lineman for the county

20:28.060 --> 20:32.600
And the Wichita lineman

20:38.570 --> 20:43.076
Is still on the line

20:43.141 --> 20:46.782
The final things these candidates will
say are their closing statements.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.985
We will begin with our first
candidate to go, Bobby Newport.

20:50.649 --> 20:54.893
Look, I wouldn't be here today if I
didn't want to be your City Councilor.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.297
Sure, it will
impress my dad,

20:57.356 --> 20:59.393
and "give me something
to do during the day."

20:59.458 --> 21:00.801
But it's more than that.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.204
How do we fix this town?
I have no idea.

21:04.296 --> 21:08.005
You tell me. That's what I'm counting on.
You telling me.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.876
I will ask
lots of questions.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.307
You give me answers.

21:13.372 --> 21:16.353
Questions are great
but answers are better.

21:16.408 --> 21:19.287
And answers
phrased as questions

21:20.379 --> 21:21.824
is how you play Jeopardy.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.053
And that's how it ends.

21:27.719 --> 21:30.063
I loved it.
It's called Babe.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.532
And I know it sounds corny,
talking pig, whatever.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.127
You should all see it.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.102
I feel like I just did.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.164
It's on.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.472
And Leslie Knope?
Closing statement?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.446
I am very angry.

21:47.673 --> 21:53.419
I'm angry that Bobby Newport
would hold this town hostage

21:53.478 --> 21:56.755
and threaten to leave if you
don't give him what he wants.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.787
It's despicable.

21:59.284 --> 22:02.891
Corporations are not allowed
to dictate what a city needs.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.093
That power
belongs to the people.

22:05.524 --> 22:10.030
Bobby Newport and his daddy would
like you to think it belongs to them.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.106
I love this town.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.067
And when you love something,

22:14.132 --> 22:15.577
you don't threaten it.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.204
You don't punish it.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.078
You fight for it.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.575
You take care of it.
You put it first.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.384
As your City Councilor,

22:25.444 --> 22:28.755
I will make sure that no one
takes advantage of Pawnee.

22:29.314 --> 22:31.191
If I seem too passionate,

22:31.249 --> 22:33.388
it's because I care.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.227
If I come on strong,

22:35.287 --> 22:37.096
it's because
I feel strongly.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.635
<i>And if! push too hard,</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:42.069
it's because things
aren't moving fast enough.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.305
This is my home.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.967
You are my family.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.441
And I promise you.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.172
I'm not going anywhere.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.609
Holy , Leslie.
That was awesome.

22:59.845 --> 23:00.949
Thanks, Bobby.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.461
Yeah! Play it! Whoo-hoo!

23:10.522 --> 23:14.436
Knope 2012! Yeah! Yeah!

23:17.863 --> 23:18.898
Ron?

23:18.964 --> 23:22.138
What the voters saw tonight
is an undeniable fact,

23:22.200 --> 23:24.840
that one of these candidates
is right for this town,

23:24.903 --> 23:26.644
and one of them is not.

23:26.705 --> 23:27.706
Thanks, guys.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.475
Ann Perkins. Uh oh.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.884
I'm sorry, Chris.
It's very flattering,

23:32.944 --> 23:35.424
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.160
It was worth a shot.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.623
Well, I hope that
whoever you end up with

23:40.685 --> 23:43.689
treats you like the amazing
person that you are.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.859
Thank you.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.563
And I am going to
go run some stairs

23:47.626 --> 23:49.105
and work through
these feelings.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.241
Is he sad?
Oh, my God.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.571
He looked sad.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.236
I'm not going out
with Chris again.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.335
Does that mean
we're getting back together?

23:56.401 --> 23:58.881
No. I don't know.
No, not right now.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.941
There's a chance I'm never going
to date anyone, ever again.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.315
I'll take it.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.116
And you know what else?

24:05.377 --> 24:07.254
I'm coming for you, girl.

24:07.312 --> 24:10.418
Just like you want.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.462
Just get out there
and spin, man.

24:12.517 --> 24:13.655
You got it.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.289
Leslie Knope is scrappy,
like a terrier.

24:16.354 --> 24:18.925
She's smooth like
a blended whiskey.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.664
My girl has big ideas
and big feelings,

24:21.726 --> 24:22.932
and she's not
afraid to express them.

24:23.562 --> 24:24.632
Was I too mean?

24:24.696 --> 24:25.731
No, you were perfect.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.071
Leslie!
Hey!

24:27.132 --> 24:29.544
That was amazing!
Oh, thank you.

24:29.601 --> 24:30.671
Hey, how was
the Spin Room?

24:30.735 --> 24:32.408
- It was a lot. We'll talk about it.
- Whoo!

24:32.471 --> 24:34.644
We did it!
We did it! Oh, my God.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.686
I was so nervous, but we
completely got through it.

24:36.741 --> 24:39.119
I haven't felt this good since I
scored that lacrosse goal at State.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.316
Seriously. Hey, party
at my dad's lake house.

24:41.379 --> 24:42.687
Bring whoever you want.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.735
Scrawny Christians.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.431
Missionaries come to him. They're
like, "Are you John Rambo?"

24:55.494 --> 24:56.529
He's like, "Yeah."

24:56.595 --> 24:58.404
And they're like, "We need
you to take us upriver."

24:58.463 --> 25:00.636
And he's like,
"It's a war zone up there."

25:00.699 --> 25:03.270
And they're like, "Yeah, we know.
That's why we have to go.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.246
"We're going to change
things."

25:05.470 --> 25:07.882
And he's like,
"You bringing any weapons?"

25:07.939 --> 25:09.316
And they're like,
"Of course not."

25:09.374 --> 25:11.513
"Then, you're not changing
anything. Go home."

25:11.576 --> 25:13.453
And then they come back
in a rainstorm.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.526
This time, he says,

25:16.581 --> 25:18.322
"Nope. Go home."

25:18.383 --> 25:21.330
They go home again.
Bottom line, they go upriver.

25:21.386 --> 25:22.831
Does not go well.
