00:00.410 --> 00:02.349
Previously on "The Listener"...

00:02.350 --> 00:04.270
You're Maya's boy.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.749
You've got the gift, just like she did.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.950
Brian Becker. I'm the
new head of the Unit.

00:08.980 --> 00:11.230
He says he doesn't want to know

00:11.260 --> 00:13.579
what happened to his mom
but I don't believe him.

00:13.609 --> 00:15.169
Say it, your name is Toby.

00:15.170 --> 00:17.463
- Toby.
- That's the only name you have now.

00:18.580 --> 00:19.699
This is not about the past,

00:19.700 --> 00:21.431
it's about the here and the now.

00:21.461 --> 00:23.199
What we are doing as a team.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.259
You sure about that?

00:24.260 --> 00:27.649
There's not much to know, really.

00:28.770 --> 00:29.709
What's not much?

00:29.710 --> 00:31.169
We're on a bridge just
outside of Auburn.

00:31.170 --> 00:33.320
There's a car, it's buried under snow.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.589
It's that guy.

00:37.590 --> 00:40.790
The guy who called saying he
has information about Toby's mom.

Oz, man.
What's up, bud?

00:52.500 --> 00:53.731
Hey..

00:54.380 --> 00:55.809
You look deep in thought.

00:55.810 --> 00:57.280
No, deep in thought is
when I'm thinking about

00:57.310 --> 00:58.159
the specials of the day.

00:58.189 --> 01:01.400
I am in a quandary,
contemplating a conundrum.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.949
- This came in the mail today.
- Yeah.

01:03.950 --> 01:06.020
Sandy's wedding invitation.
Yeah, we got that, too.

01:06.050 --> 01:08.559
You're not still bummed out
about the breakup, are you?

01:08.560 --> 01:12.229
No! It's just, you know, it says
an invitation for two.

01:12.230 --> 01:13.939
- Sure.
- Who are you going to invite?

01:13.940 --> 01:15.060
I don't know.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.799
You must know someone you can invite.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.349
I've been working
my ass off around here,

01:18.350 --> 01:19.859
I haven't had time to meet anybody.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.089
You got great girls coming
in here all the time.

01:22.090 --> 01:23.790
They're great. But they're
not great in that

01:23.820 --> 01:27.609
"I'm over you and also would you look at
who I'm dating right now".

01:27.610 --> 01:30.280
- Kind of way.
- I'm happy you're not bitter.

01:30.710 --> 01:32.120
Yeah, that is good.

01:39.264 --> 01:41.840
- Sergeant McCluskey.
- Deputy Commissioner.

01:41.870 --> 01:44.130
Judge Griffin. I've been in
your courtroom before, Sir.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.230
Sergeant. Very good of you to come in.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.690
I've certainly heard the best things.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.040
Thank you.

01:50.660 --> 01:53.449
I have to say I was a bit confused
to hear that you asked

01:53.450 --> 01:56.931
for a confidential meeting,
especially without the head my Unit.

01:56.961 --> 01:59.769
Ah. This is where things
become sensitive, Sergeant.

01:59.770 --> 02:02.330
Staff Inspector Becker is
the reason for this meeting.

02:02.340 --> 02:03.349
Judge Griffin has come to me

02:03.350 --> 02:05.469
with some very serious
allegations against Becker.

02:05.499 --> 02:06.510
What kind of allegations?

02:06.520 --> 02:11.100
Well, he's involved with a former
police officer, Curtis Maynard.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.899
I'm sorry, former police officer?

02:12.900 --> 02:15.569
Maynard was found to have worked
in collusion with a drug dealer.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.410
named Nathan Aldine.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.290
After Maynard gave false
evidence at Aldine's trial,

02:20.320 --> 02:22.729
money was tracked from Aldine
into Maynard's accounts.

02:22.730 --> 02:25.110
You can't possibly think that Becker
has something to do with this.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.499
Becker and Maynard were Partners

02:27.500 --> 02:30.579
at the Metropolitan
Police
force for over a year.

02:30.580 --> 02:34.411
Now, a source has informed us
that they are still involved,

02:34.441 --> 02:37.290
and they both have
connections to Aldine.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.429
You can't ask me
to investigate my boss.

02:40.430 --> 02:42.059
That's exactly what we're doing.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.348
And you can't have Internal
Affairs take care of this?

02:44.378 --> 02:47.400
We need to know what Maynard
and Becker are planning

02:47.410 --> 02:50.150
and how far this conspiracy extends.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.669
You and your team are perfectly placed

02:51.670 --> 02:54.040
to investigate without alerting him.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.099
You know, many of us believed
you that should have been

02:56.100 --> 02:59.020
given command of this
Unit when Klein moved on.

02:59.790 --> 03:02.949
This would guarantee you
the promotion you deserved.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.629
Look, i-if Brian Becker is a bad cop,

03:05.659 --> 03:07.449
you're gonna be doing everyone a favour

03:07.450 --> 03:10.019
by seeing him stripped of his command.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.819
We'll send you over all
the relevant material

03:11.820 --> 03:13.740
we've managed to collect already.

03:15.030 --> 03:17.250
Yeah. I'll look into it.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.589
Well, that's all we ask.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.780
I know how difficult this is for you.
So, thank you.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.840
Thank you, Sergeant.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.300
How's it going?

03:46.490 --> 03:49.170
Still monitoring the surveillance
on our weapons dealer.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.259
He's been stalling his customers

03:50.260 --> 03:52.139
- for the last week and a half.
- So what are we gonna do?

03:52.140 --> 03:54.640
- Just play the waiting game?
- Always been a game I hated.

03:54.670 --> 03:56.010
Ah, me too.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.959
Dev's filling me in
on the surveillance op.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.230
Yeah, we need to put that
on hold for a bit.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.289
How are things going
on the surveillance op?

04:05.290 --> 04:07.970
We're expecting a shipment.
It's just a matter of time.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.769
Well, keep on it.
If we don't get a break soon,

04:10.770 --> 04:13.370
we're gonna have to just
back burner this thing, OK?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.810
- So what's going on?
- I can't tell you guys here.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.170
Let's go.

04:39.820 --> 04:42.729
So I walk into this meeting
and there is Judge Griffin

04:42.730 --> 04:45.850
- And Deputy Commissioner Bamford.
- Bamford...

04:45.860 --> 04:48.920
Like our boss's boss's boss Bamford?

04:49.210 --> 04:51.149
They want us to investigate Becker.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.847
- What?
- They're saying that he's involved

04:52.877 --> 04:54.140
with this dirty cop,

04:54.170 --> 04:56.149
this guy who was working
with a drug dealer.

04:56.179 --> 04:58.568
Well that's crazy. Becker's
as straight as they come.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.059
Yeah, I know. We all know that, right?

05:00.060 --> 05:02.219
But I mean, this guy was
Becker's old partner.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.689
I don't know, maybe he's doing
something for him out of loyalty.

05:04.690 --> 05:06.239
Becker wouldn't cross a line.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.729
That's what we've have to prove.

05:07.930 --> 05:09.809
They're sending over all
of their information.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.220
We assess their Intel, and
then we need to go deeper.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.590
- We run a surveillance?
- Exactly.

05:15.070 --> 05:17.490
Look, I'm gonna need you
to read him, OK?

05:17.662 --> 05:19.819
- Do we even have a choice?
- This was an order.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.650
If we don't do it, someone else will.

05:21.660 --> 05:22.869
We do what we have to do to prove

05:22.870 --> 05:24.825
that Becker's innocent
and then we move on, OK?

05:24.855 --> 05:25.744
OK.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.349
Any luck with the company
that might have made

05:36.379 --> 05:37.540
Toby's mom disappear?

05:37.570 --> 05:40.980
None, I have spent all morning
on-line trying to find anything

05:40.990 --> 05:42.279
to do with Westerly Cable,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.359
or Westerbrook Cable.
Nothing.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.940
Same here. Not even a name
that's a derivative.

05:46.950 --> 05:49.450
So, it's just as we suspected,
it's a fake.

05:50.210 --> 05:52.660
No company. Just a name
on the side of a truck.

05:52.670 --> 05:55.849
So then what were they?
What, a cover for the people

05:55.850 --> 05:58.499
who were chasing her? Some
kind of government agency?

05:58.500 --> 06:00.319
You know, Tia, some people
might take this as a hint

06:00.320 --> 06:03.309
- to drop the whole thing.
- I'm not "Some people".

06:03.310 --> 06:04.660
I am going to see this through.

06:04.670 --> 06:06.629
OK, Nancy Drew.
Where do we go from here?

06:06.630 --> 06:09.219
- I don't know. I'll keep you posted.
- Great.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.150
Hey, any luck finding a date
for Sandy's wedding?

06:12.180 --> 06:13.419
Still working on it.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.060
I think I might have to scratch
"Supermodel" off my wish list.

06:16.090 --> 06:18.766
Yeah, that's a good start.
OK, I'll check back in later.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.159
I got the material that you
forwarded me from Bamford.

06:22.160 --> 06:26.060
It starts with Becker's
former partner, Maynard.

06:26.860 --> 06:29.360
Guy's had stellar career
for the last fifteen years.

06:29.370 --> 06:32.809
Mostly in guns and gangs.
He moved over to drugs 5 years ago.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.419
So that must be where
he first came into

06:34.420 --> 06:36.269
contact with Aldine, the dealer.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.409
Yeah, Maynard was working
the Aldine case for months,

06:38.410 --> 06:39.919
but unable to secure a conviction.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.069
And then when Aldine
was busted in a raid,

06:42.070 --> 06:43.750
Maynard shocked everybody

06:43.760 --> 06:44.590
and got the trial thrown out.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.279
Said the drugs were planted.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.419
An Internal Affairs investigation
later proved

06:48.420 --> 06:50.539
that he was in fact
getting payouts from Aldine.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.139
Where does Becker fit into all this?

06:52.140 --> 06:54.640
I think the Deputy Commissioner
may've been right.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.149
I've been checking into
Becker's phone records.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.519
He got two calls from Maynard,
two weeks ago.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.409
I have noticed he's been
using a personal phone

07:03.410 --> 07:05.369
- since we've been back.
- You think it's a burner?

07:05.370 --> 07:08.220
I do. I haven't been able
to secure the ESN yet,

07:08.230 --> 07:09.429
But if he uses it again,

07:09.430 --> 07:11.540
I should be able to snag the code
and clone it.

07:11.550 --> 07:12.470
Once I do that,

07:12.480 --> 07:13.470
we'll have a window

07:13.480 --> 07:15.469
with those conversations,
texts, e-mails, everything.

07:15.470 --> 07:18.359
Look, I'm still uncomfortable
with investigating one of our own.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.930
I think you're about to get
a little more uncomfortable.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.639
The Deputy Commissioner sent over

07:24.640 --> 07:27.015
the surveillance video from last week.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.139
What do we think is in the package?
Drugs? Money?

07:33.140 --> 07:34.480
That's what we need to find out.

07:34.490 --> 07:37.149
I was also thinking of running
a test on Becker's car,

07:37.150 --> 07:39.269
maybe I can find out what
it was he put in the trunk.

07:39.270 --> 07:40.700
OK, good.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.600
Look, none of us like is, OK?

07:45.610 --> 07:47.959
But if for some crazy
reason Becker is guilty,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.259
we can't let him take
down the rest of this Unit.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.439
When people know what I
can do, they trust that

07:52.440 --> 07:54.259
I won't be in their heads
without them knowing.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.689
I start throwing away my rules

07:56.690 --> 08:00.940
and I lose the few
relationships I do have.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.910
This is about helping Becker, OK?

08:05.900 --> 08:07.750
I need you to do this.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.130
OK.

08:14.510 --> 08:16.489
Are you sure we should be doing this?

08:16.490 --> 08:18.929
I assure you, the orders
come from the highest office.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.930
You just can't let your boss know.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.380
I don't feel any better
about this than you do.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.389
I take it that's not
a regulation equipment?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.698
Please, my coffee maker's not regulation.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.289
Neither is mine.

08:41.620 --> 08:42.729
What are we checking for?

08:42.730 --> 08:44.902
We need to do a full
drug spectrum test.

08:44.932 --> 08:46.030
OK.

08:47.010 --> 08:49.160
There are traces of powder in here.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.989
Can you at least tell me if this
is an official investigation?

08:51.990 --> 08:52.989
Honestly, it's just better

08:52.990 --> 08:54.789
if you don't know everything
that going on right now.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.399
We've been working together
a long time,

08:56.400 --> 08:57.999
I kind of thought
you'd trust me by now.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.409
I do. You know more about our Unit

09:00.410 --> 09:03.930
than anyone else in the building.
We trust you.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.309
Well, it's nice to know you
think about me in that way.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.269
Are you kidding? I think
about you all the time.

09:08.270 --> 09:11.779
- What?
- In th.. the...

09:11.780 --> 09:15.770
as... as a f-forensic investigator.

09:15.810 --> 09:19.630
Do you ever think about
anything else besides work?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.330
Yeah, I like music.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.470
- I like dancing.
- I like dancing.

09:27.940 --> 09:32.399
You know, maybe sometime,
me and you could...

09:32.400 --> 09:35.400
- No way.
- No, I didn't... I didn't...

09:35.410 --> 09:38.115
- Mean you like that, I meant...
- Cocaine.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.430
And from the speed
of the reaction, I think it's pure.

09:50.710 --> 09:54.030
Maybe the cocaine residue was from
the evidence being transported.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.859
Look, since Becker's been at the
IIB, we haven't worked a drug op.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.789
And the car was new when
it was issued to him.

10:05.790 --> 10:09.080
What are we saying here? Do we
actually believe that he's dirty?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.990
There has to be another explanation.

10:12.450 --> 10:13.820
Thank you.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.389
You got something for me
on this gun smuggling op.

10:18.390 --> 10:19.829
He still hasn't received his delivery.

10:19.830 --> 10:22.050
But I think we have
something else going on.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.849
An anonymous informant

10:23.850 --> 10:27.980
gave us a lead on a large scale
cocaine distribution network.

10:28.450 --> 10:30.140
Sounds intriguing.

10:30.170 --> 10:32.950
Not now. Could bring them too close.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.790
Word is, Metro's been trying
to take this guy down for a while.

10:37.065 --> 10:37.980
Well, then it's their play.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.180
They've got a good team over there.

10:39.210 --> 10:40.899
The informant told us
that the set dealer

10:40.900 --> 10:43.340
might have had help from
a disgraced cop.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.730
Just need another few days
to make my play.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.370
- What else do you guys know?
- That's it.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.969
The informant wants to meet
to give us more information.

10:52.970 --> 10:54.345
OK.

10:54.824 --> 10:56.820
Give the gun smuggling
op another 24 hours.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.210
If you aren't get anything,
just hop on this drug thing.

10:59.460 --> 11:00.602
Whatever the informer tells you,

11:00.632 --> 11:04.055
- I want to be the first to know. Clear?
- Of course.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.890
Thank you.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.009
- Well?
- Well, he wanted to keep us

11:12.010 --> 11:15.310
away from them for a couple of days
until he can make his play.

11:16.130 --> 11:19.320
Maybe the Deputy Commissioner
was right. Maybe he's dirty.

11:22.254 --> 11:24.949
We think Becker and Maynard
are definitely up to something.

11:24.950 --> 11:28.389
We said we wanted to open a cocaine
investigation, he got nervous.

11:28.390 --> 11:31.149
Let's get a wire on his home phone
and in his car, everywhere.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.850
Alright, so we've gotta get
some warrants?

11:32.860 --> 11:34.199
Judge Griffin already signed it.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.299
- So what do you want me to do?
- Stick out Maynard's place.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.899
Find out whatever you can.
See if he's involved with Aldine,

11:38.900 --> 11:41.889
But we have to assume
that he's dangerous, OK?

11:41.890 --> 11:43.590
Well, I'm not going to go out
looking for trouble.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.170
- OK. I'll text you his address.
- Sounds good.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.350
Who do you work for?

11:57.610 --> 11:59.320
What do you mean?
No! No, nobody. No, no!

11:59.350 --> 12:01.299
You've been sitting outside my place
for the last half hour.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.089
What are you? Metro?

12:02.090 --> 12:04.929
No, I... look, I'm
waiting for my date.

12:04.930 --> 12:05.749
You're lying.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.109
No, look, she lives
on the second floor, OK?

12:08.110 --> 12:09.059
And I was waiting here,

12:09.060 --> 12:10.979
and she called me, she said
she would be late in a meeting

12:10.980 --> 12:12.730
and so I said I would wait.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.949
What's her name?

12:13.950 --> 12:16.859
Second floor could be
the blonde? Daria?

12:16.860 --> 12:19.620
Her name's Daria, OK?
She's blonde.

12:24.405 --> 12:25.482
And I...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.409
I don't know who you thought I was

12:27.410 --> 12:30.310
- but they sure had you spooked.
- You have no idea.

12:30.860 --> 12:35.210
Either you can choose a dishonourable
discharge, or you go to jail.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.579
You know there's better
ways of dealing with people.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.490
Like, maybe you should talk
to someone that.

12:43.570 --> 12:45.870
Don't worry.
I can deal with it on my own.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.400
We don't have any option.
We gotta take Griffin out. Fast.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.570
Wait for your date somewhere else.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.129
He said he's planning
to take out the judge.

13:05.130 --> 13:06.400
And you're sure Becker was there?

13:06.430 --> 13:07.697
It's what I read, yeah.

13:07.727 --> 13:09.789
OK. Thinking Becker was selling
the drugs is one thing,

13:09.790 --> 13:11.502
but hanging out with somebody

13:11.532 --> 13:13.399
planning on taking out a federal judge?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.670
Maybe Maynard has me sort
of leverage on him?

13:15.680 --> 13:18.249
And you checked his e-mail,
his cell phone records?

13:18.250 --> 13:20.280
- Yeah, there's nothing.
- Well, if Maynard is saying

13:20.310 --> 13:22.189
that he's gonna taking out
the judge, we have to warn him.

13:22.190 --> 13:24.180
We'd be implicate Becker
a murder plot, though.

13:24.210 --> 13:27.760
If he kills him and we knew about it,
that's gonna be on us.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.870
I'll try to keep Becker
out of it if I can.

13:32.850 --> 13:35.329
- How did you find this out?
- My team is good.

13:35.330 --> 13:38.300
And we believe that Maynard will be
making a move against you.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.019
- You're certain?
- No, not certain, but I thought

13:40.020 --> 13:41.719
it was important enough
to let you know.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.930
Now we have a security detail
watching your home,

13:43.940 --> 13:45.689
your office, following
all of your movements.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.729
For how long, if you found
all this out,

13:47.730 --> 13:50.280
surely you have enough
evidence to arrest them.

13:50.624 --> 13:52.810
This was unsupported by evidence.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.940
You are hiding something.

13:54.950 --> 13:56.310
Look, I admire loyalty,

13:56.340 --> 13:58.990
but this is way past loyalty, Sergeant.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.519
As soon as we can make
an arrest or arrests,

14:01.520 --> 14:03.139
we will do whatever it is necessary.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.870
Well, I think that would
be very wise, Sergeant.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.740
Thank you.

14:13.650 --> 14:14.729
Dev. What's going on?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.409
I just got a hit on
Becker's burner phone.

14:16.410 --> 14:18.289
Maynard called Becker and
said he was feeling jumpy,

14:18.290 --> 14:20.109
said they had to make a move soon.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.959
He called for a meeting at
the rent boatyard in an hour.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.170
OK, have Toby picked up surveillance
equipment and meet me there.

14:27.970 --> 14:30.699
Corporal. I'm out for lunch.
You want anything?

14:30.700 --> 14:33.610
- I'm good.
- Alright. Back in an hour.

14:35.820 --> 14:38.460
It's a bad idea meeting in the
middle of the day like this.

14:38.490 --> 14:40.450
I'm pretty sure someone's watching me.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.380
They already took
your badge, man. 

14:43.640 --> 14:44.899
What else can be possible?

14:44.900 --> 14:45.920
OK, look.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.660
There was someone siting in a car,
outside my apartment, watching me.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.940
He said, he was there for a date
with a girl, who lives there.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.160
When I ask her afterwards,
she didn't know him.

14:56.940 --> 14:58.111
I don't know how he knew

14:58.141 --> 15:00.571
the one person on the floor,
that I know.

15:01.665 --> 15:04.190
When he said he had a date,
were you thinking about that girl?

15:04.230 --> 15:05.229
Yea, I guess.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.609
This guy, dark hair, litter eye.

15:07.610 --> 15:10.920
- Yeah. Why? You know him?
- Yeah, man, I think I know him.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.709
- What the hell is this?
- We need to make a move. Soon.

15:17.710 --> 15:18.870
Yeah, exactly.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.510
Drop the gun!

15:50.943 --> 15:53.220
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

15:53.390 --> 15:54.849
I can't believe you tiled me.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.209
What the hell's are you
going on here, Becker?

15:56.210 --> 15:57.749
You should have stayed out
of my business!

15:57.750 --> 15:58.719
We trusted you.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.309
You said you would look
into drug dealers

16:00.310 --> 16:01.610
while this guy try to take out
of a judge?

16:01.620 --> 16:03.750
Where are they getting
this from, Becker?

16:04.480 --> 16:07.300
They got to my own team, set me up...

16:14.660 --> 16:18.567
Whatever you were told,
it was a lie.

16:19.090 --> 16:21.980
He's telling the truth.
There's something else going Here.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.720
Let's put our guns down!

16:27.610 --> 16:29.020
Curtis, meet my team.

16:30.840 --> 16:34.213
Put it down, man. Put it down.

16:40.830 --> 16:41.949
How'd they get to you?

16:41.950 --> 16:43.640
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.360
They said that you're working
with a drug dealer.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.019
That you were trying
to take out Judge Griffin.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.569
You just believed him
like that, did ya?

16:48.570 --> 16:49.529
He showed us a video of you

16:49.530 --> 16:50.667
taking a package from this guy.

16:50.697 --> 16:51.802
We found drugs in your car.

16:51.832 --> 16:54.178
You found what they
wanted you to find.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.320
- You could have just asked me.
- Why didn't you just tell us?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.703
You should have trusted us.

16:58.733 --> 16:59.630
Oh, God.

17:02.150 --> 17:04.229
We need talk about this, alright?
We need to talk.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.037
We can't talk about it at the IIB,

17:06.067 --> 17:06.973
out here in the open.

17:07.002 --> 17:08.474
- It's not safe.
- Alright, look.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.290
We can go to my place, OK?

17:10.319 --> 17:11.770
It's off the radar.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.930
- What? You trust them?
- Yes, I trust them.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.713
And right now it's
your only choice, so let's go.

17:28.318 --> 17:30.860
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thanks.

17:31.598 --> 17:34.170
- Is that coffee fresh?
- It was fresh this morning.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.570
Did you want tell us what's going on?

17:36.600 --> 17:39.100
It's Curtis' story.
I'll let him tell it.

17:41.570 --> 17:44.499
I was investigating a drug dealer.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.346
- Aldine.
- Yeah.

17:45.376 --> 17:47.026
I tried everything
I could to catch him dirty.

17:47.056 --> 17:49.540
But he... was always
step ahead of us.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.089
He was working with
someone in the force?

17:51.090 --> 17:53.210
Maybe, that's not what this is about.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.009
Anyway, I caught some Intel
that he was making big deals.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.850
So I order backup.

18:00.350 --> 18:01.699
He shows up at a warehouse,

18:01.700 --> 18:04.600
he parks his car, I lower the boom.

18:04.930 --> 18:07.249
I order him out of the car,
I put him up against the wall,

18:07.250 --> 18:09.189
I pat him down. Next thing I know,
I turn around

18:09.190 --> 18:12.529
and there's 3 bricks of coke
sitting on he front seat of his car.

18:12.530 --> 18:14.419
That's great. You got exactly
what you were looking for.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.409
Yeah. Except they weren't
here 20 seconds ago,

18:16.410 --> 18:18.560
when I got Aldine out of his car.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.729
But forensics shows up
the next morning,

18:20.730 --> 18:22.260
his prints are all over it.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.679
- He was set up.
- Yeah. Everybody up and down the line

18:24.680 --> 18:26.339
was congratulating
themselves with the bust,

18:26.340 --> 18:27.570
but I knew it was wrong.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.839
You know what, I've got no problem
putting away a guy like Aldine.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.159
But there is a way to do this job.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.529
So you testified that the drugs
weren't in the car.

18:35.530 --> 18:37.860
Next thing I know, I'm being convicted.

18:39.070 --> 18:40.629
You know, for taking payoffs

18:40.630 --> 18:42.810
they had all these bogus
evidences against me.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.900
They made me take the
dishonourable discharge.

18:46.930 --> 18:48.189
So who do you think was behind it?

18:48.190 --> 18:49.750
That's where I come in.

18:49.810 --> 18:51.389
Curtis asked me to look into it

18:51.390 --> 18:54.619
and listen, it's not just a story
about a couple cops gone bad.

18:54.620 --> 18:55.629
It's way bigger than that.

18:55.630 --> 18:58.249
You know that package,
you guys saw me, take from Curtis?

18:58.250 --> 19:00.500
Well, that was all the evidence
he'd put together.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.279
And most of it led right
back to Judge Griffin.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.640
I went through all the cases
he'd presided over.

19:05.820 --> 19:08.269
In the last three years alone
there've been 12 cases

19:08.270 --> 19:11.079
where hard-to-catch criminals,
they show up in front of his bench,

19:11.080 --> 19:12.609
they claim they've been set up

19:12.610 --> 19:15.429
These guys, most of them get
railroaded into long sentences.

19:15.430 --> 19:16.930
And the three people who got off?

19:16.940 --> 19:19.609
They were found murdered a month
after their release.

19:19.610 --> 19:21.059
You guys are saying

19:21.060 --> 19:23.589
that Griffin is running
some kind of star chamber?

19:23.590 --> 19:26.210
He's killing the people he can't
take down in his courts?

19:26.620 --> 19:28.319
OK, you know this is
hard to believe, right?

19:28.320 --> 19:30.700
It was hard for me to believe too,
until I saw the evidences.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.680
Listen, Curtis is a good cop.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.149
He's not dirty.

19:34.150 --> 19:36.419
Judge Griffin was just
getting you to take me down,

19:36.420 --> 19:37.670
because I'm helping him.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.300
Or to witness your death.

19:39.510 --> 19:42.299
Maybe he didn't trust that
we'd believe you're dirty.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.440
So he tried to make it look like
a drug deal gone bad.

19:45.470 --> 19:46.694
He's a powerful man.

19:46.724 --> 19:48.079
He got the Deputy Commissioner

19:48.080 --> 19:49.739
to initiate this whole investigation.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.300
He's got friends everywhere.

19:52.303 --> 19:55.029
The problem is, we don't know
which ones of them are involved.

19:55.030 --> 19:56.809
You know, I warned him
that he might be in danger.

19:56.810 --> 19:59.140
That's probably why he made
his move on you.

19:59.314 --> 20:01.610
- I could have gotten you killed.
- Look,

20:02.853 --> 20:04.680
I didn't bring you guys in on this

20:04.690 --> 20:07.000
because I didn't want to put
anyone else in danger.

20:07.010 --> 20:10.219
But now that you guys know,

20:11.460 --> 20:13.300
you've got a decision to make.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.549
I think we've gotta make it look like

20:14.550 --> 20:16.689
we're still trying to take you down.

20:16.719 --> 20:19.139
It's Dev. He says he has something.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.499
Curtis, we're not gonna take you home.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.789
We'll find you a place to lay low,

20:21.790 --> 20:23.249
these guys, they probably won't give up.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.100
How do we fight these guys,
they hold all the cards.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.118
Not quite, there's one
card we haven played.

20:27.148 --> 20:27.920
Let's go.

20:27.930 --> 20:29.890
Fill Dev in. Meet up with you later.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.739
OK, so we run tests on
the shooter's weapon.

20:32.740 --> 20:33.760
We found fingerprints

20:33.770 --> 20:35.839
belonging to a female
associate of Aldine's.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.579
That's convenient.

20:36.580 --> 20:39.129
Try to make it look like one of
Aldine's people took them out.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.789
Yeah, but we have to assume
this is the same woman,

20:40.790 --> 20:43.470
who planted the drugs in the
back of Becker's car, right?

20:45.590 --> 20:47.790
Would the security cameras
in the IIB parking garage,

20:47.820 --> 20:48.810
would they cover that area?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.650
Yeah, sure, but I told
you I already checked them.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.130
Becker's the only one
that touched his car.

20:52.140 --> 20:54.159
Yeah, but if these people
had access to the IIB,

20:54.160 --> 20:56.729
they could have got a hold of
the footage and doctored it.

20:56.730 --> 20:58.400
Would you be able to
tell if they did that?

20:58.760 --> 21:00.859
Yeah, I can check for glitches

21:00.860 --> 21:02.630
that might show some edit points...

21:07.320 --> 21:08.519
I don't know how
I didn't see this before.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.050
There was a truck backing up
and it just disappeared.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.529
You're totally right.
They edited the footage

21:12.530 --> 21:13.770
and they doctored the time code.

21:13.780 --> 21:15.389
Can you restore the lost footage?

21:15.390 --> 21:16.500
It'll just take some time.

21:18.350 --> 21:19.410
McCluskey.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.840
Yeah, of course. I can be there
in half an hour.

21:24.540 --> 21:25.760
OK, see you then.

21:26.230 --> 21:27.869
- What is it?
- It's Judge Griffin.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.480
He wants a further report on the
danger that I warned him about.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.419
You're not going to go.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.620
I have to, otherwise he'll
know something's wrong.

21:34.750 --> 21:37.880
But maybe we can find out more
from him than he will from me.

21:37.970 --> 21:39.480
Keep working on the footage.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.269
Well, honestly, from this
talent record of your team,

21:46.270 --> 21:49.730
I would have thought you'd have
had this all wrapped up by now.

21:50.140 --> 21:53.959
It's... It's important for us
2to find the evidence, Sir.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.510
You know, we need to follow procedure.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.109
You should see the world
from my bench.

22:00.139 --> 22:02.109
Murderers, thieves, drug dealers

22:02.139 --> 22:03.680
who's destroying our city,

22:04.710 --> 22:06.199
all waking free.

22:07.090 --> 22:10.360
About six years ago, I presided over
a human trafficking case.

22:11.220 --> 22:14.008
Solid evidence supported
the charges that the man behind

22:14.038 --> 22:16.729
it brought in over 200 women.

22:16.730 --> 22:19.590
Over 30 of those women were found...

22:20.510 --> 22:22.780
found murdered over a two year span.

22:24.090 --> 22:26.339
Now between the lawyer's ploys
and the jury's uncertainty,

22:26.340 --> 22:30.769
that man walked free...
free to continue doing his business.

22:30.770 --> 22:34.010
Well, everyone has a
limit... That was mine.

22:35.010 --> 22:37.999
Seeing that man walk free,
laughing at me,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.550
laughing at our system of justice.

22:42.350 --> 22:44.250
That's just more than I could abide.

22:45.380 --> 22:48.240
I've had my share
of criminals walk free.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.420
But I've also seen
innocent men go to prison.

22:52.650 --> 22:54.210
I still believe in the system.

22:54.890 --> 22:57.310
Individuals can't decided what justice is.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.359
Well, that's where you're wrong.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.209
And thinking like that
could lead an officer

23:00.210 --> 23:02.510
with a promising career
into dangerous water.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.800
That sounds like a threat.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.800
Just an observation.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.890
Especially if that officer had
a husband with a criminal record

23:15.199 --> 23:18.549
always one step away from his
business losing its liquor license,

23:18.550 --> 23:19.719
maybe going to jail.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.140
And if that officer had a little girl?

23:23.380 --> 23:26.270
Child services would have to get involved,

23:26.710 --> 23:32.080
what happens to children who enter
the system is really quite tragic.

23:33.070 --> 23:37.620
And I imagine that the rest of your team
have loves and lives that they...

23:37.650 --> 23:39.750
would like to keep safe as well.

23:41.030 --> 23:43.949
So I would think very hard about

23:43.950 --> 23:46.880
this next move, Michelle.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.479
Because you could move very
rapidly up the chain of command

23:50.480 --> 23:53.108
or you could just as rapidly

23:53.138 --> 23:55.979
head in the opposite direction.

23:57.810 --> 24:02.465
The choice is entirely
up to you. Of course.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.200
Now listen to me.

24:14.290 --> 24:16.700
If you betray me I'll know
before you do.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.380
The people who work with you,
they're protected?

24:19.690 --> 24:22.255
If you do your part, I'll do mine.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.100
You are now a ghost in
the service of justice...

24:27.306 --> 24:28.689
You're untouchable.

24:28.719 --> 24:30.691
_

24:37.381 --> 24:39.638
It's OK.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.599
- Hello?
- Hey Adam, it's me.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.420
I need you to get Carrie. And you
two need to go somewhere safe, OK?

24:46.430 --> 24:48.229
And you guys need to stay
there until you hear from me.

24:48.230 --> 24:49.643
- What's going on?
- It's a case.

24:49.673 --> 24:52.628
I'm just afraid that it might
spill over to you and Carrie.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.019
This isn't good, Mich.

24:54.020 --> 24:56.080
I'm gonna fix it though,
I promise you.

24:56.090 --> 24:57.457
Yeah.

24:58.530 --> 24:59.980
Let's go. Let's go.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.989
I've been pretty busy
since you've been back, guys.

25:06.990 --> 25:08.239
And it seems pretty certain

25:08.240 --> 25:10.940
that Aldine's associate did the shooting.

25:12.430 --> 25:13.709
I checked with Metro

25:13.710 --> 25:16.600
and nobody has a hit
on him for months.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.840
OK, so this whole thing's
had me a little bit paranoid

25:33.850 --> 25:36.129
so I ran a sweep of the office.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.509
I found one of those little buggers
under each of our desks,

25:38.510 --> 25:39.689
including Becker's office

25:39.690 --> 25:41.069
The phones, the computers?

25:41.070 --> 25:42.019
The phones are all tapped.

25:42.020 --> 25:43.540
The only thing not tapped
is my computers

25:43.720 --> 25:44.939
since I've re-coded the firewalls.

25:44.940 --> 25:47.650
What about the security
footage from the garage?

25:49.400 --> 25:50.309
Yeah.

25:50.310 --> 25:51.799
I found it. I checked it out.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.880
You remember that van
that pulled out and disappeared?

25:54.890 --> 25:55.559
Yeah.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.480
Look what happens after they leave.

25:58.650 --> 26:00.739
Unfortunately the video's
a little bit low-res

26:00.740 --> 26:01.880
for me to I.D. her from.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.879
When I read Griffin I saw
him give her a new identity

26:04.880 --> 26:07.100
in the name of Alice Merton.

26:07.170 --> 26:08.370
Alice Merton.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.619
OK, let me check it out.

26:09.620 --> 26:12.130
If we don't get a break here, I mean,

26:12.620 --> 26:14.700
the judge is gonna make us pay.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.300
You're not saying we give in?

26:16.310 --> 26:17.310
No.

26:18.070 --> 26:20.160
But that's exactly what
it's gonna look like.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.319
I want to know who shot at me.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.160
We believe it was one
of Aldine's people.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.849
You know what?
While we're on the subject,

26:32.850 --> 26:34.379
what were you doing there with Maynard?

26:34.380 --> 26:35.560
That's not your concern.

26:35.570 --> 26:37.459
If you're involved
in something like this,

26:37.460 --> 26:38.439
you need to let us know.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.459
What is this, corporal?
Some kind of interrogation?

26:40.460 --> 26:42.329
Your friend Maynard is dirty

26:42.330 --> 26:43.689
the sooner you come to terms with that,

26:43.690 --> 26:45.549
the sooner your problems will be over.

26:45.550 --> 26:48.580
You know what, get the
hell out of my office.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.059
OK, it looks like the room
is clear of listening devices,

27:00.060 --> 27:02.670
but, I really can't be
sure about the phones.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.499
Great.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.929
We're gonna find a way through this.

27:04.930 --> 27:05.999
We're gonna get our lives back.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.699
Griffin assumes that
I've made my decision.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.710
So that should buy us a bit more time.

27:09.810 --> 27:12.419
I looked into the shooter's
name that Toby got from Griffin:

27:12.420 --> 27:13.699
Alice Merton.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.289
Now she's registered
in all of the systems,

27:15.290 --> 27:17.139
but the address is totally bogus.

27:17.140 --> 27:18.960
So she really is a ghost.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.019
Not quite.

27:20.020 --> 27:23.069
The image quality from the
surveillance photo from the garage

27:23.070 --> 27:24.820
was too low-res for facial rec.

27:24.850 --> 27:27.569
but I was able to use
the photo from her fake ID

27:27.570 --> 27:32.400
to find that her name
is Renee Rucka.

27:32.430 --> 27:33.539
Age 33.

27:33.540 --> 27:34.949
Top student in her class

27:34.950 --> 27:36.679
in both high school
and her police academy.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.279
But she left halfway
through her last year

27:39.280 --> 27:40.339
and just sort of fell off the map.

27:40.340 --> 27:42.219
More like she was cherry-picked,

27:42.220 --> 27:43.839
recruited into Griffin's organization

27:43.840 --> 27:46.399
before she was known to the rest
of the low enforcement community.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.059
So this is Griffin's enforcer.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.090
So now we just have to find this ghost.

27:53.803 --> 27:55.547
- Hey.
- Hey...

27:56.846 --> 27:57.700
They...

27:57.730 --> 27:58.750
Yeah.

27:58.780 --> 28:00.270
Hey.

28:02.210 --> 28:03.651
Hi, um...

28:04.189 --> 28:05.480
So...

28:05.680 --> 28:07.269
- What's going on?
- Something's come up,

28:07.270 --> 28:11.589
and there's been a threat
made against all of us.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.899
So we gotta be extra
careful these next few days.

28:14.050 --> 28:16.260
OK. Can you tell me what it is?

28:16.290 --> 28:20.209
There's some people high up
who are taking

28:20.210 --> 28:21.529
the law into their own hands.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.630
And they're gonna stop
anyone who gets in their way.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.360
- And that would be you.
- That would be us.

28:26.390 --> 28:28.239
We're going to do everything
we can to take care of it.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.600
Everything's gonna be OK.

28:29.820 --> 28:30.639
Promise?

28:30.640 --> 28:32.840
Yes, I gotta go.

28:38.420 --> 28:41.569
Whoa, Dev. My life is research,

28:41.570 --> 28:44.689
but this is not your garden
variety search engine.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.429
It's tunneled into the IIB Mainframe.

28:46.430 --> 28:48.299
I actually have it tricked
out so it's full clearance

28:48.300 --> 28:50.640
two levels up from the
Deputy Commissioner's office.

28:50.650 --> 28:53.980
Wow, that's incredible.
Way above me.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.510
- Corporal.
- Excuse me.

29:04.190 --> 29:06.929
Look, we really don't know how
far up the chain this thing.

29:06.930 --> 29:09.220
We don't know who
we can trust, if anyone.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.539
Griffin and his people don't know
that we know about the bugs.

29:35.540 --> 29:36.629
We can use that.

29:36.630 --> 29:38.609
You mean, feed them even
more false information?

29:38.610 --> 29:41.009
Yeah, we bait a trap and
take down whoever comes out.

29:41.010 --> 29:44.120
- If they don't take us down first.
- No one lives forever.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.050
Let's get back to the office.

29:46.590 --> 29:48.170
See if we can put on a good show.

29:51.555 --> 29:54.040
Hey, look, maybe you
should go to your mother's,

29:54.110 --> 29:55.470
until this blows over.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.000
- Careful.
- Alright. Super careful.

29:58.515 --> 30:01.140
- Logan.
- Yup. See ya, babe.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.369
You got into Dev Clarke's computer,

30:07.370 --> 30:09.450
the most secure computer
on the planet?

30:09.490 --> 30:11.349
It turns out the Westerbrook cable...

30:11.350 --> 30:13.209
It's a front for an ex-federal agent

30:13.210 --> 30:15.920
who specializes in helping
people disappear.

30:17.720 --> 30:21.590
I had the phone number.
The question is, should I use it?

30:22.813 --> 30:24.336
The answer is yes.

30:24.570 --> 30:26.070
Yes. A resounding yes.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.640
I mean we got this far, didn't we?

30:40.530 --> 30:41.407
Yes?

30:41.584 --> 30:46.218
Hi. You don't... you don't know
me, but I need your help.

30:46.600 --> 30:50.610
You provided services to a woman
in Auburn about 4 years ago.

30:50.620 --> 30:51.720
You've got the wrong number.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.800
We don't provide services in that area.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.360
Look, I know what you really do.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.790
The woman is my boyfriend's
mother. And, um...

31:01.280 --> 31:03.559
I have to get in touch with her.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.030
I told you I don't know
what you are talking about.

31:06.100 --> 31:07.950
I'm just trying to bring
them back together.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.440
She had to abandon him
when he was a child.

31:13.930 --> 31:15.350
She was trying to protect him,

31:16.790 --> 31:19.130
and that was then and
this is now. And now.

31:21.470 --> 31:24.420
Sir, he is connected to people
who can look out for them.

31:25.090 --> 31:26.640
Look out for both of them...

31:30.040 --> 31:32.076
I know this goes against the
whole point of your business

31:32.106 --> 31:34.130
and you have no reason to help me.

31:35.180 --> 31:37.850
Except that it would mean a lot to him.

31:39.170 --> 31:41.600
And I think it would mean
a lot to her, too.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.850
I know the woman you're looking for.

31:49.030 --> 31:53.100
But you're too late.
She died over a year ago.

31:53.410 --> 31:54.400
I'm sorry.

31:56.550 --> 31:59.340
You be wise to lay it to rest, too.

32:01.072 --> 32:02.040
Thank you.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.090
He said she's dead.

32:15.790 --> 32:16.920
What do we do?

32:18.620 --> 32:22.570
Well, I'm just saying here,

32:23.780 --> 32:25.670
Toby didn't want you
to go looking for her.

32:27.550 --> 32:29.069
He's made peace with where he is.

32:29.070 --> 32:32.050
I can't not tell him.
He needs to know.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.150
Yeah, you're probably right.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.820
I just got a call.
I thought you should know.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.829
Hey Curtis. It's me. Listen,
I think I've got something.

33:00.830 --> 33:04.680
I've figured out a way to take
down Griffin and his whole network.

33:05.744 --> 33:08.780
No, I can't entrust my
own people on this one.

33:08.860 --> 33:10.560
This is just you and me.

33:11.670 --> 33:14.420
Meet me at the docks at
the end of Cherry street.

33:14.490 --> 33:17.070
I'll have all the evidence
we need. Yeah.

34:21.909 --> 34:24.030
IIB! Stop where you are!

34:28.400 --> 34:29.731
Freeze!

34:31.190 --> 34:32.681
Freeze!

34:33.030 --> 34:34.690
On the ground, now!

34:37.790 --> 34:39.739
On your knees, now!

34:49.850 --> 34:51.710
Your aim is proving.

34:56.370 --> 34:58.320
I'd also say you owe me
a new windshield,

34:59.950 --> 35:02.550
but I think that's really the least
of your problems right now.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.230
Let's go.

35:13.380 --> 35:15.510
You're not leaving here alive.

35:16.260 --> 35:17.610
Take it easy. We need he alright?

35:19.930 --> 35:21.110
Take a rest.

35:23.410 --> 35:25.810
If you guys think I'm talking
to you, you're wasting your time.

35:26.150 --> 35:27.740
How long do you think
you can hold me?

35:28.320 --> 35:30.620
You think you and Griffin
work outside the system?

35:31.393 --> 35:33.310
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

35:33.350 --> 35:35.440
- I don't even know any Griffin.
- Yeah, you do.

35:36.740 --> 35:38.380
What, you think you can trust him?

35:39.060 --> 35:40.630
'Cause I know if he were right here,

35:40.720 --> 35:42.190
he'd give you up in a heartbeat.

35:42.450 --> 35:44.409
He won't turn on me if he's smart.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.920
conversations, evidence...

35:46.950 --> 35:50.159
Oh, OK. I get it. You've probably got
your bases covered,

35:50.160 --> 35:51.789
don't you? A little bit of insurance.

35:51.790 --> 35:54.780
Some evidence stashed away
just in case they try anything.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.360
I just hope you kept it
somewhere safe...

36:02.120 --> 36:05.489
Jenny, you've gotta keep it
for me... anything happens,

36:05.490 --> 36:07.409
Anything at all, you
send it out, the press,

36:07.410 --> 36:08.990
the internet, everybody. OK?

36:12.020 --> 36:13.570
I'm just playing with you.

36:14.095 --> 36:15.439
We've already arrested
your friend Jenny.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.000
We got what you put in the locker.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.639
You know I can't talk to you.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.760
Gods, they'll kill me.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.210
Without your insurance policy,
they'll kill you anyway.

36:26.220 --> 36:27.990
Your only chance is to cooperate.

36:29.810 --> 36:30.770
Come on.

36:36.490 --> 36:39.129
I'm not used to unannounced visits,
Sergeant.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.419
I think my assistant
should have notified me.

36:41.420 --> 36:42.960
Oh, she assured me
it would be fine.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.870
You should know I'm beginning
to lose patience.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.369
So I hope you come to me
with some good news.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.570
No, actually, I've come
with very bad news.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.393
You're under arrest.

36:53.715 --> 36:56.032
Really?

36:56.680 --> 36:59.130
Do you have any idea how
difficult that's going to be?

36:59.510 --> 37:00.690
Not so difficult.

37:02.260 --> 37:04.459
If you're thinking of phoning
the Deputy Commissioner,

37:04.460 --> 37:05.199
I wouldn't bother.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.710
He's been arrested along with the
rest of your little star chamber.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.359
Turns out your enforcer, Rucka,

37:09.360 --> 37:10.669
was really good at keeping records.

37:10.670 --> 37:12.739
She kept recordings of
all your conversation,

37:12.740 --> 37:13.790
evidence of every hit.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.510
She's down at our office
right now giving her statement.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.010
You threatened my family.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.429
Now I'm going to make sure
that you're put away for a very,

37:20.430 --> 37:21.730
very long time.

37:22.789 --> 37:23.661
Ugh!

37:36.550 --> 37:38.489
OK, so I realize yeah, listen,

37:38.490 --> 37:40.989
I should have brought you
guys on this way earlier.

37:40.990 --> 37:41.930
But I don't want...

37:42.519 --> 37:44.150
to put you guys in jeopardy.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.560
That turned out well, didn't it?

37:45.850 --> 37:47.719
Yup. I told you when
you started here:

37:47.720 --> 37:49.070
we take care of each other.

37:50.020 --> 37:52.359
I'm just happy we came out
of this in one piece

37:52.360 --> 37:53.509
and so did our families.

37:53.510 --> 37:54.359
Here, here.

37:54.360 --> 37:57.280
And speaking of family,
I'm going to get home to mine.

37:57.870 --> 37:59.640
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

38:00.330 --> 38:02.690
- Me too.
- Hey, uh Logan.

38:04.620 --> 38:07.509
Spent the last three years thinking
that you got Charlie Marks killed.

38:07.510 --> 38:11.150
And thinking that
if I put my trust in you that

38:11.887 --> 38:13.009
others would get hurt, too.

38:13.010 --> 38:15.250
- Look, I get it.
- No, man. I'm sorry.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.530
That was wrong.

38:17.770 --> 38:18.970
You're really, um...

38:21.400 --> 38:23.828
You really pulled out
all the stops for Maynard.

38:23.858 --> 38:24.659
And for me, too.

38:24.660 --> 38:25.929
I appreciate that, thank you.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.840
OK, you know what you
would do the same thing.

38:29.690 --> 38:31.350
It's nice working with you again.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.302
- You have a goodnight.
- You too. See you tomorrow.

38:41.123 --> 38:42.524
Goodnight, team.

38:49.292 --> 38:50.892
Guess just you and me.

38:51.650 --> 38:52.849
Yes.

38:54.644 --> 38:57.840
You did really great work on
this. I mean, you always do.

38:58.610 --> 38:59.650
Thanks.

39:00.190 --> 39:01.282
You too.

39:02.065 --> 39:03.130
Thanks.

39:08.838 --> 39:12.070
OK, well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:14.570 --> 39:15.720
Hey, Alex...

39:18.550 --> 39:21.009
You remember before you
said you liked dancing...

39:21.010 --> 39:25.360
Yes... I would love to go out with you.

39:25.370 --> 39:26.852
- Really?
- Yeah!

39:27.263 --> 39:29.250
My gosh, that took way too long.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.473
Is it really over?

39:43.940 --> 39:45.584
It's over.

39:54.519 --> 39:56.182
You know, when they...

39:56.474 --> 39:58.459
When they said they were gonna
come after you and Carrie,

39:58.460 --> 40:02.370
I...I actually scared myself,
you know, I thought that...

40:02.550 --> 40:04.710
I thought that I would killed them.

40:05.310 --> 40:06.700
But you didn't.

40:07.610 --> 40:09.580
That will always be the difference.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.060
So, listen, I have

40:16.530 --> 40:18.629
a whole time vacation time phase.

40:18.630 --> 40:21.070
And I think, three of us,

40:21.810 --> 40:23.400
should go a road trip.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.330
What do you think?

40:25.620 --> 40:26.900
I don't know, Mich.

40:27.730 --> 40:30.590
The club's busy, I'd lose customers...

40:35.880 --> 40:38.130
I'm totally kidding.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.384
- That's a brilliant idea.
- Yeah?

40:44.520 --> 40:45.560
Let's get the hell out of here.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.793
- Give me 20 minutes to pack the car.
- Alright.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.200
- Hey!
- Hey.

41:03.230 --> 41:04.701
Look who's back?

41:04.731 --> 41:05.800
Uh!

41:06.265 --> 41:07.419
Is there a beer with
my name on it?

41:07.420 --> 41:08.359
You got it, my man.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.371
Thanks.

41:10.192 --> 41:11.611
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:15.410 --> 41:16.979
You took down the people
who were threatening you?

41:16.980 --> 41:17.809
Better believe we did.

41:17.810 --> 41:20.810
Judges, cops, politicians
and IIB brass.

41:21.060 --> 41:23.079
The reporter in me needs details.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.429
You gonna get all the details.

41:24.430 --> 41:26.220
And so is to be the news.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.870
You know what? No.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.459
You need to write a book.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.699
Or you might wanna leave
all the details of how you

41:31.700 --> 41:32.769
read a bunch of people's minds

41:32.770 --> 41:34.589
and then used that information
to help convict criminals.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.183
Oh yeah, that's obvious.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.586
What's up?

41:44.646 --> 41:46.680
I have to talk to you about something.

41:47.503 --> 41:48.904
Sounds serious.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.570
I know you ask me not to....

41:55.160 --> 41:56.440
look into you past.

41:57.330 --> 41:58.583
What did you do?

42:12.580 --> 42:14.040
It's been a long time.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.387
I'm so proud of you.

42:16.730 --> 42:18.218
You're really here.

42:18.940 --> 42:20.719
I am so sorry for leaving you.

42:20.720 --> 42:21.998
Stop, stop, mother.

42:22.028 --> 42:25.640
- I know you were trying to protect me.
- Toby.

42:25.940 --> 42:28.605
You must be the young woman
who called the cable company.

42:33.060 --> 42:34.621
Guys, this is my mom.
