12:01.171 --> 12:03.037
but when Hoxley does it,
it's a magic trick?

12:03.131 --> 12:05.206
Says the guy
who bought his book.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.876
Maybe what our boy Bright needs
is a moniker.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.395
Like, uh...

12:10.546 --> 12:11.788
BrainHacker.

12:11.806 --> 12:12.972
JT:
Professor Profile.

12:13.124 --> 12:14.733
DANI:
Captain CrimeFighter.

12:23.818 --> 12:26.035
-You got something?
-Uh, no.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.080
Nothing yet.

12:29.975 --> 12:32.584
<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> My boy! It's okay. I'm alone.</i>

12:32.811 --> 12:35.661
So...

12:35.814 --> 12:37.313
a globe-trotting killer

12:37.332 --> 12:40.407
is murdering his own...
couriers?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.319
And the agent thinks it's the
same person who killed Endicott.

12:43.412 --> 12:46.155
So I need to outthink him
before he gets too close.

12:46.216 --> 12:49.325
But if the murderer kills
this courier

12:49.344 --> 12:52.845
who saw your face,
maybe that works in your favor.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.164
I'm just floating an idea.

12:55.183 --> 12:58.193
No. That woman does not
deserve to die.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.838
Yes, excellent point, of course.

13:01.931 --> 13:04.173
(clears throat)
So, uh, who's this...

13:04.267 --> 13:07.285
Eurotrash investigator
they've sent?

13:08.013 --> 13:09.496
It's Simon Hoxley.

13:11.683 --> 13:13.440
The MindSleuth?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.700
The one and only.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.610
Ooh, boy.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.021
He's got a perfect track record.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.705
<i> Perfect conviction rate.</i>

13:19.800 --> 13:20.873
Perfect teeth.

13:20.967 --> 13:21.949
For a Brit.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.468
This is not helpful.

13:23.695 --> 13:25.545
<i> You know, for years,</i>
<i> he tried to interview me,</i>

13:25.697 --> 13:27.121
<i> but I wasn't interested.</i>

13:27.173 --> 13:28.807
That's why I barely earned
a passing mention

13:29.034 --> 13:31.367
<i> -in his book.</i>
-Can we focus?

13:31.386 --> 13:32.477
Please?

13:32.704 --> 13:34.962
I am deceiving my team,
and I'm currently

13:34.981 --> 13:37.131
breaking into
a seafood processing plant.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.208
I should not be doing
any of these things.

13:39.260 --> 13:40.877
Yeah, well,
your family is at stake.

13:40.895 --> 13:42.803
If you want to get ahead
of Simon Hoxley,

13:42.897 --> 13:44.471
you're gonna
have to be ruthless.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.050
Yeah, well,
I can<i> think</i> ruthless.

13:47.068 --> 13:49.068
I don't know
if I can<i> be</i> ruthless.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.570
Okay, so let's think ruthless.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.388
Why a seafood fac...

13:52.481 --> 13:54.165
(laughs): Oh...

13:54.317 --> 13:57.894
Oh, I bet they vacuum-sealed
and flash-froze

13:57.912 --> 14:00.654
<i> Mr. Endicott</i>
<i> like a big-eye tuna.</i>

14:00.748 --> 14:02.248
Yeah, that sounds about right.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.234
<i> Yeah, well, your father</i>
<i> has skills, my boy.</i>

14:05.253 --> 14:06.827
<i> I just wish more people</i>
<i> would utilize them.</i>

14:06.847 --> 14:08.071
<i> I tell you what.</i>

14:08.164 --> 14:09.848
Why don't I break out,

14:09.999 --> 14:12.016
take care of Hoxley...

14:12.911 --> 14:14.185
I'm not hearing any of this.

14:14.337 --> 14:16.521
<i> And then we all go</i>
<i> on the run together!</i>

14:16.748 --> 14:19.065
No, no, no, no, no.

14:21.753 --> 14:24.237
-(dial tone droning)
-So you're saying that's a no?

14:31.613 --> 14:32.745
(groans)

14:46.127 --> 14:48.177
I'm sorry about this.

14:50.782 --> 14:53.266
Be ruthless.

14:56.545 --> 14:57.878
(grunts, groans)

14:57.972 --> 14:59.898
(nearby rattling)

15:00.049 --> 15:01.423
DANI:
You're not their main supplier,

15:01.425 --> 15:02.959
but we still have
to cover all our bases.

15:03.052 --> 15:05.052
Well, fine,
but our crew's gone home.

15:05.146 --> 15:07.463
We're gonna need your records
on personnel, too.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.032
We got a body!

15:11.727 --> 15:13.620
Oh, God.

15:13.805 --> 15:14.895
That's Brian.

15:14.989 --> 15:17.040
Brian Tamishiro.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.375
I'm calling it in.

15:28.744 --> 15:30.336
(camera clicking)

15:30.488 --> 15:33.056
-(police radio chatter)
-(sirens wailing outside)

15:34.601 --> 15:36.250
You got here fast.

15:37.178 --> 15:39.520
I was in the neighborhood.
(chuckles)

15:41.775 --> 15:43.015
Why is your arm wet?

15:43.168 --> 15:45.559
BRIGHT:
Oh... (laughs)

15:45.612 --> 15:46.794
Uh...

15:46.796 --> 15:49.355
if you really want to know,
there was a, um,

15:49.449 --> 15:50.673
cab and a pothole

15:50.766 --> 15:52.024
and water and...

15:52.118 --> 15:53.952
Hey, this the victim?

15:54.103 --> 15:55.602
The dead man? Yes.

15:55.697 --> 15:57.121
Good catch.

15:58.049 --> 15:59.606
The victim is Brian Tamishiro.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.017
He worked as a delivery driver,

16:01.035 --> 16:03.795
but he also did packing
and shrink-wrapping.

16:04.022 --> 16:07.281
Endicott's body never showed
much evidence of freezer burn,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.709
so the shrink-wrapping
and flash-freezing were

16:09.861 --> 16:11.194
likely done here.

16:11.287 --> 16:13.196
I'm never buying
frozen fish again.

16:13.214 --> 16:15.807
Vic was shot twice,
and as a bonus,

16:15.958 --> 16:17.976
the killer took his thumb.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.978
Initial blood spatter is
contained.

16:20.205 --> 16:22.963
And Brian was here after
the shift finished, which means

16:22.983 --> 16:24.874
he stayed late to meet someone.

16:24.892 --> 16:27.727
I believe
the victim knew his attacker.

16:27.879 --> 16:29.045
Now...

16:29.063 --> 16:30.713
the missing thumb.

16:30.732 --> 16:33.140
The killer took the thumb
because he needed it.

16:33.234 --> 16:36.643
I'll wager we haven't
recovered a phone yet.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.889
(chuckles) I was gonna say
the same thing.

16:39.907 --> 16:42.074
And you'd both be right--
no phone.

16:42.227 --> 16:44.577
It'll be an older model
with a print scanner

16:44.729 --> 16:46.153
instead of facial recognition.

16:46.247 --> 16:49.065
Otherwise, the killer
would have taken the whole head.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.341
BRIGHT (laughs):
Yes.

16:50.568 --> 16:53.085
Yes, we are lucky that
that's not the case.

16:53.238 --> 16:56.589
The killer will use the phone
to locate the next link

16:56.683 --> 16:57.923
in the chain.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.910
Maybe we can get there first.

17:00.928 --> 17:02.912
Save whoever it is.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.747
I was going to say
the same thing.

17:04.766 --> 17:07.416
Look at that, you guys
agreeing on something.

17:07.477 --> 17:10.936
(chuckles) When a crime scene
is this obvious,

17:11.089 --> 17:12.679
so are the conclusions.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.349
Or perhaps the scene is obvious

17:15.368 --> 17:18.494
because it was designed to be?

17:30.291 --> 17:32.425
Dr. Capshaw, are you all right?

17:35.630 --> 17:37.764
I'm fine.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.450
Nice work with the pans.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.061
Thank you.

17:45.807 --> 17:47.273
What is it?

17:49.718 --> 17:51.794
The, um...

17:51.813 --> 17:53.145
(inhales sharply)

17:53.298 --> 17:55.073
...the patient from earlier.

17:55.224 --> 17:57.800
He had a bleed
in his subclavian.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.077
He-he died.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.746
Ten minutes after he got
to the trauma center.

18:01.897 --> 18:04.323
Damn.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.167
I'm sorry.

18:07.812 --> 18:09.754
You're sorry?

18:11.591 --> 18:12.815
The Surgeon?

18:12.834 --> 18:14.908
<i> A</i> surgeon.

18:15.002 --> 18:17.670
I once was a doctor like you.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.247
Yeah, with a complete lack

18:20.266 --> 18:22.433
of regard for human life.

18:22.585 --> 18:24.435
Not complete.

18:24.662 --> 18:26.662
I've gotten that call.

18:26.755 --> 18:28.755
It hurts.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.999
You don't believe me?

18:30.017 --> 18:32.017
You killed 23 people.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.112
Never on my operating table.

18:34.339 --> 18:37.340
Church and state, Dr. Capshaw.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.617
I never mix business
and pleasure.

18:39.768 --> 18:42.453
How can you separate the two?

18:42.680 --> 18:44.847
Perhaps that was my...

18:44.866 --> 18:47.291
particular brand of madness.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.777
I'm here, after all.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.446
As are you.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.989
It's a job.

18:53.991 --> 18:56.300
You're better than this place.

18:57.528 --> 19:01.055
Well, tell me,
h-h-how did you end up here?

19:03.977 --> 19:06.260
They told me you'd do this.

19:06.371 --> 19:07.794
Do what?

19:07.889 --> 19:10.556
Lure me in.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.725
Manipulate me.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.278
It's not happening, Whitly.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.197
I'm in charge.

19:19.642 --> 19:21.492
Do we understand each other?

19:22.612 --> 19:24.737
Yes.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.555
I believe we do.

19:26.649 --> 19:28.040
Good.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.152
The blood drain's clogged.

19:32.246 --> 19:35.298
Wipe up the floor,
and you can go.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.051
It would be my pleasure.

19:41.406 --> 19:44.073
-Good Lord, that is excellent!
-(laughs)

19:44.091 --> 19:46.091
American women make
better cocktails,

19:46.244 --> 19:47.927
and I'll fight anyone
who disagrees.

19:48.079 --> 19:49.520
Just keep piling on the charm,

19:49.747 --> 19:52.172
and maybe I won't notice that
you are here with an agenda.

19:52.266 --> 19:54.583
Mm, another great
American quality.

19:54.602 --> 19:57.102
-Getting down to brass tacks.
-Well...

19:57.197 --> 20:00.013
I know you think Nicholas
was killed in New York,

20:00.107 --> 20:02.107
and I was one of the last people
to see him alive,

20:02.202 --> 20:04.109
so your curiosity is
understandable.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.537
Hmm. I'm glad you feel that way.

20:06.764 --> 20:08.931
(exhales)
But, sadly...

20:09.024 --> 20:12.168
I can't offer any insight
on Nicholas's death.

20:13.938 --> 20:16.288
Now, how did
a clever woman like you

20:16.441 --> 20:20.292
get entangled with
so many homicidal men?

20:20.445 --> 20:21.794
(laughs)

20:21.946 --> 20:24.313
So we're already
down that road, are we?

20:24.373 --> 20:27.450
You must've been furious
when your latest paramour

20:27.468 --> 20:29.876
turned out to be
a murderous thug.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.879
Jessica Whitly...
played for a fool...

20:32.974 --> 20:36.025
yet again.

20:38.053 --> 20:41.989
So...<i> I</i> killed Nicholas.

20:44.986 --> 20:47.227
(chuckles)

20:47.247 --> 20:50.155
Perhaps I did it...

20:50.250 --> 20:53.417
after his thug stabbed Gil
in the gut

20:53.644 --> 20:56.462
and I sat by my dying friend
in the hospital.

20:57.498 --> 20:59.665
Or... maybe...

20:59.817 --> 21:01.259
during Gil's surgery!

21:01.410 --> 21:03.094
I took a little trip
to the snack machine

21:03.321 --> 21:06.171
and lured Nicholas back
to my lair and killed him.

21:06.324 --> 21:07.490
Right here.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.993
But most likely,
Detectives Powell, Tarmel and I

21:11.012 --> 21:13.938
stayed by Gil's side
as he clung to life.

21:14.089 --> 21:15.998
Is that alibi sufficient
for you?

21:16.017 --> 21:18.759
I cannot believe
I made you a martini.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.260
Well, I am very honored

21:20.280 --> 21:21.946
to have been invited
to your home.

21:22.097 --> 21:25.283
It's quite perfect.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.601
Yes, it is.

21:27.695 --> 21:29.512
Which is why it's puzzling

21:29.530 --> 21:30.771
you would even suggest

21:30.865 --> 21:34.083
that Nicholas Endicott
was killed here.

21:34.869 --> 21:36.201
(gasps) I was just...

21:36.354 --> 21:38.945
I never would have imagined
that this very room

21:38.965 --> 21:41.206
might be the scene of the crime.

21:41.359 --> 21:45.118
-Oh...
-His throat was slit, you know.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.379
A bloody business that is.

21:47.532 --> 21:51.142
And now I'm noticing
this brand-new rug.

21:51.293 --> 21:54.270
It's less sun-drenched
than its counterpart.

21:55.964 --> 21:59.058
I've met some terrifying men
in my day...

21:59.210 --> 22:01.134
so if you're trying to scare me,

22:01.228 --> 22:03.988
you're gonna have to
do better than this.

22:05.066 --> 22:07.825
-Now...
-(pats hands)

22:08.052 --> 22:11.220
I hope you enjoy
your stay in New York.

22:11.313 --> 22:14.540
I intend it to be a short trip.

22:20.989 --> 22:23.007
(door opens, closes)

22:23.158 --> 22:25.676
(breath trembling)

22:25.828 --> 22:28.971
Family meeting. Now.

22:32.259 --> 22:35.335
You should have called me
the second he showed up.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.521
Because that wouldn't
have seemed suspicious.

22:37.748 --> 22:39.297
She has a point.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.266
You have no idea what I've been
doing to keep this family safe.

22:41.419 --> 22:45.270
No, we don't.
Because you do not let us in.

22:45.423 --> 22:47.089
Oh, well, what would you
like to know?

22:47.182 --> 22:48.849
How I've been dishonest
with my team?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.184
Or maybe you'd like to know
about the thumb in my freezer.

22:51.278 --> 22:53.946
-Wait, what?
-I do not want to know that.

22:54.098 --> 22:55.873
Just "letting you in."

22:56.024 --> 22:57.099
AINSLEY:
Okay, well, I for one

22:57.192 --> 22:58.951
think we've done
a pretty good job

22:59.103 --> 23:00.769
in regards to this murder.

23:00.863 --> 23:02.454
JESSICA:
Are you listening to yourself?

Didn't see you there.

37:15.959 --> 37:17.567
That's okay.

37:17.794 --> 37:19.361
I know you had a long night.

37:21.222 --> 37:22.464
(sighs)

37:22.557 --> 37:25.817
Turned out she was in
pretty deep with Endicott,

37:25.969 --> 37:28.078
and we know how he used people.

37:29.306 --> 37:31.873
It's looking like she just...
(sighs)

37:32.809 --> 37:34.960
...had enough and killed him.

37:38.815 --> 37:40.740
I...

37:40.759 --> 37:42.342
I tried to save her.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.429
I know.

37:47.674 --> 37:49.099
You did good work here.

He had some help.

37:50.994 --> 37:52.176
(chuckles)

37:52.329 --> 37:53.103
I just gave my statement

37:53.254 --> 37:55.663
to Detectives Powell and Tarmel.

37:55.682 --> 37:56.940
Now I'm off for some rest,

37:57.091 --> 38:01.736
relaxation and painkillers.

-You are always welcome here.

Lieutenant Arroyo,
I promise I will try.

38:19.447 --> 38:20.964
(pats arm)

38:23.860 --> 38:25.969
Glad you're here.

38:26.196 --> 38:28.162
I wanted to apologize.

38:28.164 --> 38:31.141
-I got so defensive
of my family...
-No, stop.

38:32.126 --> 38:34.719
It's you who should
have the apology.

38:34.871 --> 38:39.149
Threatening you with
a paring knife was so dramatic.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.026
What was I thinking?

38:42.729 --> 38:44.212
"Those who mine darkness

38:44.230 --> 38:46.364
see shadows
where there are none."

That's from<i> MindSleuth.</i>

38:49.235 --> 38:51.569
You have read my book.
(chuckles)

38:51.663 --> 38:53.404
And I'll read the next one.

38:53.557 --> 38:55.147
Oh. That's kind.

38:55.241 --> 38:59.502
But there's nothing sexy
about the silver medalist.

39:01.565 --> 39:02.505
You solved this one.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.824
Not true.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.677
You were the one who tied
Endicott to the courier network,

39:07.829 --> 39:11.756
followed the murder trail
from Estonia to Manhattan.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.909
I was more
of a supporting character.

39:14.928 --> 39:19.597
-More Lestrade to your Sherlock.
-Hmm.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.108
You found the head of the snake.

39:23.269 --> 39:26.421
It's almost as if
my investigation forced

39:26.439 --> 39:30.158
the head of the snake to
come back and eat her own tail.

39:30.944 --> 39:32.443
Sounds like a best seller.

39:32.596 --> 39:34.687
Maybe.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.022
But the press is so fickle.

39:37.117 --> 39:40.293
I haven't booked
an appearance in years.

39:41.438 --> 39:43.713
I might be able
to help with that.

39:43.865 --> 39:46.290
Tell me, what was it like

39:46.443 --> 39:50.035
to finally catch the woman
that murdered Nicholas Endicott?

39:50.088 --> 39:54.373
It felt like something
we all needed.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.392
Closure.

39:55.543 --> 39:57.394
I go into more detail
in my new book

39:57.621 --> 39:59.211
<i> The Ouroboros Murders.</i>

39:59.231 --> 40:03.975
<i> Named after the ancient symbol</i>
<i>of a snake eating its own tail.</i>

40:04.127 --> 40:06.144
<i> Hmm. That's a brilliant title.</i>

<i> It really is. Yeah.</i>

40:11.317 --> 40:13.801
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you enjoyed that

40:13.895 --> 40:15.895
-a little too much.
-Of course I did.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.249
I got to put this Endicott mess
behind us.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.075
And the prime-time slot.

40:21.828 --> 40:24.254
To getting away with murder.

40:24.405 --> 40:25.380
Oh...

40:27.926 --> 40:31.386
How about--
to keeping it in the family?

40:33.432 --> 40:35.748
-I'll drink to that.
-(Ainsley chuckles)

40:35.767 --> 40:38.184
To family.

40:49.522 --> 40:51.072
Mr. David?

40:52.784 --> 40:57.162
I was dreaming about Versailles,
so this had better...

40:58.940 --> 41:00.439
Dr. Capshaw.

41:00.459 --> 41:05.186
I sent Mr. David to check
on another patient.

41:05.205 --> 41:09.782
I assure you we're very alone.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.192

41:11.285 --> 41:15.472
what plans you had
for my suture scissors...

41:16.866 --> 41:19.200
...but I need them back.

41:20.127 --> 41:22.395
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.983
Then you can't think
very much of me.

41:33.808 --> 41:38.286
You don't have the slightest
clue what I think of you.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.374
I won't ask you again.

41:46.229 --> 41:48.079
I'm doing you a favor, Whitly.

41:48.231 --> 41:50.915
If you're caught
with those scissors,

41:51.067 --> 41:54.260
14 days in isolation.
