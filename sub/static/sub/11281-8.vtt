"Everybody Hates Minimum Wage"
Closed Captioned

00:03.137 --> 00:07.241
CHRIS ROCK:
By 1986 I'd been working
at Doc's for three years.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.443
Outside of getting robbed
four times,

00:09.477 --> 00:12.346
sick on the pickles three times
and a double hernia,

00:12.380 --> 00:15.649
it was the single greatest
job I ever had.

00:15.683 --> 00:19.653
And from time to time, a pretty
girl might stroll in.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.124
In exchange for all
my hard work,

00:23.157 --> 00:24.658
I got paid three dollars
an hour.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.694
Good job, man.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.663
$60-- cold hard cash.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.132
I had the perfect job...

00:31.165 --> 00:33.534
till I found out
about minimum wage.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.803
Basically, minimum wage
is the only guarantee

00:35.836 --> 00:37.505
people get paid in money.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.108
Your boss would pay you in
Popsicle sticks if he could.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.476
Great work.
A Popsicle stick?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.578
What do you take
this thing for, man?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.780
I cannot work and live off
no Popsicle sticks.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.283
The least you can do is give me
the damn Popsicle.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.785
Minimum wage. Shoot.

00:51.819 --> 00:56.190
There was a time when
the maximum wage for
black folks was zero.

00:56.224 --> 01:00.761
But now the government requires
that you pay me $3.35 an hour.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.530
Well, work for
the government.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.865
Look, Chris, I like
having you around

01:04.898 --> 01:06.867
and you do a good job.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.302
But I just can't
spare the money.

01:08.336 --> 01:11.205
It's only 35 cents
more an hour.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.442
35 cent an hour...
that's $28 a month.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.577
That's three cartons
of milk a day,

01:16.610 --> 01:18.746
that's two boxes of
Mike and Ike an hour.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.515
That's no.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.617
That's when I realized
I'd found the one person

01:23.651 --> 01:24.918
cheaper than my father.

01:24.952 --> 01:28.589
I thought about picketing, but
I was afraid this would happen.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.757
He won't pay!

01:29.790 --> 01:31.692
I won't stay!

01:31.725 --> 01:33.761
He won't pay,
I won't stay!

01:33.794 --> 01:36.130
I thought about a sit-in,
but I was afraid

01:36.164 --> 01:37.665
this would happen again.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.866
* Wages...

01:40.301 --> 01:42.536
No justice, no peace!

01:44.772 --> 01:46.307
But I decided on an ultimatum.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.209
Doc, listen,

01:48.242 --> 01:50.778
I come in on time,
and I never leave early.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.913
I work hard,
so I deserve minimum wage.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.915
And if you're not
going to give me a raise,

01:54.948 --> 01:56.917
I'm going to have to leave.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.586
It's a matter of principles.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.853
Is that an ultimatum?

01:59.887 --> 02:00.921
Well, is it?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.223
Yeah.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.461
Nice working with you.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.797
You'd really let me go?

02:09.830 --> 02:10.764
Where else are you
going to find

02:10.798 --> 02:13.334
somebody as reliable
and trustworthy as I am

02:13.367 --> 02:15.669
that'll work for $60 a week?

02:15.703 --> 02:17.605
Sir, are you hiring?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.774
Well, am I?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.276
Are you?

02:22.310 --> 02:24.178
Depends.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.179
You gonna pay me?

02:25.213 --> 02:26.447
Nope.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.783
Then yes, 'cause I quit.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.853
Maybe I should have gotten
Al Sharpton involved.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.197
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:43.231 --> 02:47.235

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

03:06.454 --> 03:07.921
ROCK:
I tried to get minimum wage

03:07.955 --> 03:09.790
while my father tried to get
minimum sleep.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.860
Guess what? Vanessa asked me
to be her hair model

03:12.893 --> 03:14.528
for the upcoming
hair show.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.830
By "Vanessa asked," she meant
"I begged."

03:16.864 --> 03:20.534
Please, please, please, please
let me be your hair model!

03:20.568 --> 03:22.970
Fine. Pull yourself together.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.606
Thank you!

03:25.639 --> 03:26.874
Hair show, huh.
Yes.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.008
Does it pay?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.878
Well, it pays $100, but I'm
not doing it for the money.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.881
You know, it's always
been a dream of mine
to be a hair model.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.683
Julius, I could just
see myself

03:35.716 --> 03:36.984
walking down that runway.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.867
I said, "You better
give me my money, fool."

03:53.901 --> 03:57.438
At dinner, Drew looked sadder
than 69-cent shoes.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.939
Hey, Drew.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.608
What's wrong?

04:00.641 --> 04:01.842
Failed my history test.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.845
Told you sleeping in a room with
Chris would make you stupid.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.013
Tonya, hush.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.114
What happened, baby?

04:07.147 --> 04:10.518
I studied, but when
I sat down, my mind went blank.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.954
Your mind went blank?
What kind of excuse is that?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.923
Did you eat breakfast?
Yes.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.791
Well, did you get
a good night's sleep?

04:17.825 --> 04:18.992
Yes.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.894
Well, boy, did you hit
your head

04:20.928 --> 04:22.863
on a stupid rock
on the way to school?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.698
No.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.967
Well, I'm gonna help you study
for that next test.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.302
'Cause I didn't raise
no dummies.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.970
Bush's mom says that, too.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.071
How was work, Chris?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.040
Huh?
How was work?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.409
Oh, oh, it was fine.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.044
Good. Tell Doc I said hi.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.045
He's a good guy.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.981
Yeah, he's great.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.418
If I developed a drug problem,
my next job might be president.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.519
You quit?

04:45.553 --> 04:47.455
Yeah, now I have
to find another job.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.923
I can't tell my dad
I quit my job.

04:49.957 --> 04:50.924
He'll kill me.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.927
I've got a couple things
circled to check out.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.931
* How happy you made me, oh,
Mandy, well, you came... *

04:57.965 --> 05:00.000
Greg?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.535
* Well, you came
and you gave without... *

05:01.569 --> 05:02.603
Greg!
What?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.705
You're drooling.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.940
* But I sent you away,
oh, Mandy... *
It's Mandy.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.742
* You kissed me and stopped
me from shaking... *
She's so hot.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.077
She's all right.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.945
Plus, you've been saying
that for the past month.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.014
Why don't you just
go talk to her?

05:14.047 --> 05:16.384
I can't just go up to her
and start talking.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.951
Works for pimps.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.487
Yeah, you can.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.054
Okay, smarty-pants,

05:21.088 --> 05:23.924
Do I say "hi"?
Do I say "hello"?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.826
Or maybe "hey"?

05:25.859 --> 05:26.960
Or even "hey, hi"?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.562
The possibilities
are endless.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.964
We haven't even gotten
to what I'll be wearing.

05:30.998 --> 05:35.102
I know what you'll be wearing--
a look of frozen terror.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.937
* And I need you...

05:36.970 --> 05:41.975
I wasn't getting paid,
and Greg was afraid.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.778
Oh, girl, I'm so excited!

05:44.812 --> 05:46.547
So what styles
do you have in mind?

05:46.580 --> 05:50.418
Well, let me tell you about
my follicular extravaganza.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.485
Girl, check out
Vanessa's designs.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.655
Ooh, my goodness!

05:54.688 --> 05:56.123
Who did these drawings?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.825
Girl, my cousin Dante.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.159
He's taking an art class
in prison.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.562
ROCHELLE:
They are so cute.

06:01.595 --> 06:05.599
I could just picture myself
in all of them.

06:05.633 --> 06:09.603
My mother imagined herself
in the Eiffel Tower...

06:09.637 --> 06:12.940
the Helicopter...

06:12.973 --> 06:14.842
and the Black Smacker.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.411
Ooh!

06:17.445 --> 06:21.915
I've decided to go with
the one that is the most
difficult technique-wise.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.151
The Tsunami.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.987
Whoa. You know what, I heard
the last hairdresser

06:27.020 --> 06:28.456
who tried the Tsunami died.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.023
No, actually, the hairdresser
was fine--

06:30.057 --> 06:32.059
It was the model
that died.
What?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.093
Mm-hmm, hairspray poison.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.028
Wait a minute,
what's this one?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.930
Girl, that's the upside down
cruise ship--

06:36.964 --> 06:38.098
you know, The Poseidon
Adventure?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.232
But we're not
going to do that one.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.635
You know how hard it is to get
1,500 tiny little people

06:41.669 --> 06:43.837
made out of hair?
It's a mess.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.440
Wait a minute, I heard
Jacquot LeBluke is competing.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.908
This is a long, dramatic story

06:47.941 --> 06:48.909
about back-stabbing
hairdressers

06:48.942 --> 06:51.078
that we've heard before.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.813
So we're going to move on.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.683
While my mother got
a dye job,

06:55.716 --> 06:59.219
I went to get a job-job.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.855
This was the first restaurant
in Bed-Stuy

07:01.889 --> 07:03.190
without a bulletproof window.

07:03.223 --> 07:06.059
There was the bulletproof
fish place...

07:06.093 --> 07:08.496
then the bulletproof
salad bar...

07:08.529 --> 07:10.931
and the bulletproof
hot dog stand.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.067
MAN:
Yeah, man, can I get
a number two, please?

07:14.101 --> 07:14.902
When can you start?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.204
Tomorrow after school.
You're hired.

07:17.237 --> 07:21.241
The job pays minimum wage
and all the rice you can eat.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.644
I'll take it!

07:23.677 --> 07:26.680
Listen closely,
and you'll learn how to say

07:26.714 --> 07:28.816
the "N" word in Chinese.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.984
Now focus, boy.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.222
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.624
Chris, where
you been?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.626
You were supposed to
be back an hour ago.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.260
I was out selling crack.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.196
Not all my early attempts
at comedy were a success.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.632
Just kidding.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.667
I was out
looking for work.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.235
Found a job working
at Hoo's Hunan.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.269
Hoo's on First?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.072
I like Woks on Second.
What happened to Doc's?

07:52.105 --> 07:53.507
He refused to pay me
minimum wage,

07:53.541 --> 07:55.075
so I found a job that would.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.744
Minimum wage.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.780
I paid a man to let me
work my first job.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.148
You kids
got it good.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.150
It's about the principle, Dad,
not the money.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.787
I work hard, and if the man says
I should be paid $3.35

08:06.820 --> 08:08.088
then he should pay me.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.590
Good luck with that.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.191
You get free Chinese food?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.060
Yeah, all the rice I want.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.628
I like those principles.

08:14.662 --> 08:18.098
Good, 'cause I ain't cooking
till after the hair show.

08:18.131 --> 08:22.069
The next day,
I got $3.35 worth of new job.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.073
About as much as you look
like Yoko Ono.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.307
You're late.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.842
No, I'm not.
It's 3:00.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.943
It's 3:01.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.178
Now, get to work.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.479
No matter what I did,

08:32.512 --> 08:36.083
it seemed like I was supposed
to be doing something else.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.154
When I washed the floors...

08:41.188 --> 08:44.157
Lionel Ritchie,
set the tables.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.893
When I set the tables...

08:45.926 --> 08:48.896
Lionel, organize
the fortune cookies.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.832
When I organized
the fortune cookies...

08:54.602 --> 08:57.304
5:30. Lionel Ritchie,
go wash the dishes.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.774
He wouldn't talk to the real
Lionel Ritchie like that.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.083
What?

09:10.117 --> 09:12.252
Keep on working.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.255
I was lucky Mr. Fong
wasn't zoned to grow cotton.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.367
What are you doing?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.937
Oh, I finished the dishes, so
I decided to start my homework.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.104
No homework.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.339
You have work-work.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.108
But Doc always let me
start my homework.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.645
Well, you are not
at Doc's anymore.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.212
Go fix the menu numbers.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.850
I was getting minimum wage
and having minimum fun.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.823
My new job wasn't just
making me tired of working,

09:49.857 --> 09:51.959
it was making me
tired of Greg.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.694
Hey, man, you look terrible.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.663
I know.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.930
I work more
at Hoo's in a day

09:56.964 --> 09:59.332
than I do at Doc's
in a month.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.335
There's Mandy.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.337
I've decided to go
with "hey."

10:04.371 --> 10:07.340
Can't figure out what I'm gonna
do with my hair though.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.977
Should I part it to the side
or go straight back?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.112
Shave it off and start over.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.682
Chris, wake up, I'm trying
to tell you something.
What?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.149
I've been having
a hard time

10:16.183 --> 10:17.250
with my Mandy situation.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.252
This girl could be
my future ex-wife,

10:19.286 --> 10:21.388
and I don't want
to mess it up.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.190
Greg still isn't over
his parent's divorce.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.291
That's not a real problem.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.293
You think you're
having a hard time?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.195
You've got an
obvious solution.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.930
Let me help you.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.064
Hey, Mandy...

10:32.065 --> 10:33.200
Greg wants
to talk to you.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.668
Who's Greg?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.638
Him.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.344
There, how's that?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.079
You're embarrassing me.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.447
And when it comes
to embarrassing myself

10:47.480 --> 10:50.183
in front of girls,
I don't need any help.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.419
I don't know.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.822
I think she kind of liked him.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.695
Ta-da!

11:01.729 --> 11:04.431
Well, what do you think?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.767
Fabulous!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.435
Now, remember,
don't move it.
Don't touch it.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.337
Don't stick
anything in it.
Don't scratch your head.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.939
Don't move
your eyebrows.
Don't shower.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.440
Don't bathe.
Wash up.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.475
And, most important
of all, don't lie down.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.710
Well, how am I
supposed to sleep?

11:16.744 --> 11:19.112
You're not supposed to sleep.
You're a hair model.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.948
Well, models sleep.
They don't eat.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.282
Not hair models.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.450
They eat, not sleep.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.285
Everybody gather round!
Look at me!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.054
Look at me!

11:27.087 --> 11:28.488
Ooh!

11:28.521 --> 11:30.390
While a team of people
worked on my mother's hair,

11:30.423 --> 11:33.260
Idid the work of a team.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.296
He who sleeps at work wakes up
with a foot in the ass.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.098
I wasn't sleeping.
I was breathing.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.067
Well, breathe while you work.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.502
Mr. Fong,
can I ask you a question?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.371
All talk
and no work

11:44.404 --> 11:47.474
makes Chris unemployed.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.877
I embarrassed my friend Greg
in front of a girl,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.111
and now he won't talk to me.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.112
What should I do?

11:52.145 --> 11:54.114
Here.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.388
"Get back to work."

12:01.421 --> 12:03.824
Now, hand out
these delivery menus.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.426
People found the idea
of getting food delivered

12:06.459 --> 12:08.461
in Bed-Stuy unbelievable.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.530
Delivery in Bed-Stuy.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.465
Unbelievable.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.902
Delivery

12:14.935 --> 12:16.503
Man, you crazy.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.006
I got kids over here
I don't visit.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.508
So how's it going

12:21.541 --> 12:22.475
out there, Chris?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.444
They're not working you
too hard, are they?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.413
No. It's great.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.480
Mr. Fong's cool.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.350
So how's it going here?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.318
Good.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.153
Good.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.788
So, um...

12:34.822 --> 12:36.423
it's not too hard, you know,

12:36.456 --> 12:39.559
working over here by yourself?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.394
Hey, Chris.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.463
James, what are
you doing here?

12:43.496 --> 12:44.464
I work here.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.199
You think I'm just
walking around in an apron

12:46.233 --> 12:47.467
carrying boxes for nothing?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.002
I'm trying
to make some

12:49.036 --> 12:50.403
extra money.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.872
Man, there must be
something wrong with you.

12:51.905 --> 12:52.940
This is a goodjob!

12:52.973 --> 12:54.975
I'm sure glad you quit.

12:55.008 --> 12:58.578
And tell Tonya I'm holding
aside the bubble gum she likes.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.513
You're going
to be holding your teeth

13:00.547 --> 13:03.150
if you go near my sister.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.019
You failed
the test again?!

13:06.053 --> 13:07.855
But we studied this, boy!

13:07.888 --> 13:09.890
What happened?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.925
I don't know.
My brain froze.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.260
Well, you better
thaw it out!

13:13.293 --> 13:15.829
My teacher says she wants
a parent to come in.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.564
Well, your father
will go with you tomorrow.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.166
Why can't you go?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.834
I can't go with this hair.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.035
I don't want those people

13:22.069 --> 13:23.536
to think I'm some
no-account hair model.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.405
Here.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.575
If Drew didn't
get it together quick,

13:28.608 --> 13:30.978
he was going to be lost at sea.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.214
Delivering in Bed-Stuy
was an adventure.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.188
Who is it?!

13:41.221 --> 13:42.856
Hoo's.
Who's what?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.025
Hoo's delivery.
Who--- I don't know!

13:45.058 --> 13:47.060
Man, it's Chinese food!
Oh.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.996
Thank you.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.007
Chinese food.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.942
Oh, don't worry,
'cause this your last supper!

14:01.975 --> 14:04.044
I saw you with her!

14:04.077 --> 14:05.612
Didn't you see him, baby?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.047
Everybody did!

14:07.080 --> 14:08.916
You must think
I'm stupid or blind.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.018
Maybe you think
I'm stupid andblind.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.485
How much is it, baby?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.453
Well, one thing
I promise you--

14:13.486 --> 14:15.923
you ain't going to have
to think much longer!

14:15.956 --> 14:17.624
He must think I'm crazy.
He must...

14:17.657 --> 14:19.626
Baby

14:19.659 --> 14:23.163
Oh. Oh, no, don't move.
Don't move!

14:28.335 --> 14:31.604
Lionel Ritchie, you're back just
in time for another delivery.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.406
I'm not going back out there.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.342
This neighborhood
is too dangerous for deliveries.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.509
You're basically
sending me out there

14:36.543 --> 14:39.112
with a sign saying, "Hey,
I got money. Please rob me."

14:39.146 --> 14:40.647
Plus, I almost got shot.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.417
My nephew has been shot by
the Chinese army seven times.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.489
He should stop attacking China.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.523
Here's your check.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.059
Maybe it help
you feel better.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.596
$48.29?

14:56.629 --> 14:58.298
Where's the rest of the money?

14:58.331 --> 15:01.534
Taxes. The law says
I have to take out withholding.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.403
Welcome to America.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.005
Now take this
to Decatur Street.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.008
Uh-uh. You take it.
'Cause I quit.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.277
And I don'tlook
like Lionel Ritchie.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.378
Yes, I do!

15:15.115 --> 15:17.250
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Chris.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.952
How's the new job
working out?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.988
I quit.
You quit?

15:21.021 --> 15:22.622
Quitting is for smoking
and drinking.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.025
You better have a good reason
for quitting your job.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.460
Mr. Fong kept yelling at me,
I almost got shot at,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.196
I got robbed,
I'm getting sick of rice,

15:29.229 --> 15:30.630
and to top
that all off,

15:30.663 --> 15:32.966
I'm getting paid
way much less
than I was before.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.534
You know what, Chris?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.436
You quit Doc's
for your principles.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.605
He was a good boss,
but you picked minimum wage

15:38.638 --> 15:39.706
over good working conditions.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.242
Looks like you picked
the wrong principle to stand on.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.510
Yeah, I did.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.645
What you going to do now?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.647
I'm going to go out
and find a new job.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.516
That's not it, Chris.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.352
You can't just quit every time
you don't like something.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.022
What if Miles Davis
had quit the trumpet?

15:55.055 --> 15:56.356
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.724
What if George Washington Carver
quit the peanut?

15:57.757 --> 16:00.060
What if B.B. King
quit "Lucille"?

16:00.093 --> 16:02.495
What if Paul Robeson
quit "Old Man River"?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.431
What if Bill Cosby
quit Jell

16:04.464 --> 16:06.766
What if Mr. T quit
pitying the fool?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.700
What if Stevie
quit wondering?

16:07.734 --> 16:10.537
What if Fat Albert
quit The Cosby Kids.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.039
What if Ashford
quit Simpson?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.140
What if Michael Jackson

16:13.173 --> 16:14.574
quit doing
the moonwalk?

16:14.607 --> 16:16.143
What if Diana Ross
quit The Supremes?

16:16.176 --> 16:17.644
Diana Ross
did quit the Supremes.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.312
You get my point.
Just go get a job.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.547
Okay.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.551
Later, my mother's Tsunami
came crashing down in waves.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.390
Hair today, gone tomorrow.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.162
Oh, hey...

16:35.195 --> 16:37.797
The tsunami turned
into Hurricane Rochelle.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.332
What happened
to my hair?

16:39.366 --> 16:40.700
What happened to my hair?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.102
All my work! What did you do?

16:42.135 --> 16:43.670
What did you do?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.439
What am I supposed to do
with a head full of broken hair?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.440
What am I gonna do
about the show?

16:47.474 --> 16:48.441
Oh, God, the show!

16:48.475 --> 16:50.410
Forget the show!

16:50.443 --> 16:51.678
Julius is never going
to sleep with me again!

16:51.711 --> 16:52.679
Everybody's going to think...

16:52.712 --> 16:54.814
My mother's career
as a hair model was over

16:54.847 --> 16:57.717
faster than Pacman Jones'
career as a citizen.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.355
My father went to get to
the bottom of Drew's problem,

17:02.389 --> 17:04.757
which was actually
where the problem started.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.093
Is that
Ms. Crabtree?

17:06.126 --> 17:08.395
Yep. That's her.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.397
My father took one look
at Ms. Crabtree

17:10.430 --> 17:11.664
and knew exactly
why Drew was failing.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.500
Excuse me. Can I help you?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.136
Hi, Drew.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.837
Hi.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.107
Is all of that
really necessary?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.774
I'm sorry. All of what?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.710
All of this.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.278
I mean, the boy
can't even concentrate.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.546
Neither can you.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.780
I'm sorry.
I still don't follow.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.849
Excuse me.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.852
Drew, what's eight times 12?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.321
I don't know.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.855
How about now?

17:35.888 --> 17:36.789
96.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.826
Who wrote
the Declaration of Independence?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.328
I don't know.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.462
How about now?

17:42.495 --> 17:43.730
Thomas Jefferson.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.499
Drew, what's your name?

17:46.533 --> 17:48.335
I don't know.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.372
Look, if you're going
to be an educator,

17:52.405 --> 17:55.175
buy some uglier clothes.
Please.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.478
Come on.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.647
Drew's grades improved
after he transferred

18:00.680 --> 18:02.182
to the class of Miss Murphy,

18:02.215 --> 18:04.717
a 90-year-old lady
with a mustache.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.885
Come on.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.420
All righty, class.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.721
So, today, we're going to learn

18:08.755 --> 18:09.722
about the Mexican-American War.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.725
What do we know about
the Mexican

18:12.759 --> 18:13.926
Anybody?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.263
We know we'd like to take you
out for Mexican food.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.598
Nobody?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.135
Hey, Greg.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.838
Ididn't know
what to say to Greg,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.575
so I imagined
what Doc would say.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.812
Chris, you need to tell
your friend you're sorry.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.881
Why? He's the one
with the problem.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.749
All I did was
try to help.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.585
I got him
talking to Mandy.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.753
You got him to feel
like an idiot.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.389
He is an idiot.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.856
All I got to do
is say "hi."

18:48.295 --> 18:49.596
Look, Chris.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.632
A man can't say "hi"
or "good-bye" to a woman

18:52.665 --> 18:54.634
unless he's ready
to do it on his own.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.769
Now, you got him
to talk to Mandy.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.406
Now you got to get him
to talk to you.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.709
Hey, man, listen.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.811
I'm sorry for embarrassing you
in front of Mandy.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.813
What the heck?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.281
It's not like I have other
friends to hang out with.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.783
So we're cool?
Yeah.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.454
We were friends,
but we were far from cool.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.194
I can't believe the Knicks

19:21.228 --> 19:22.762
lost that game
last night.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.830
Hey, Doc.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.369
Hey. Good to see you, Chris.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.970
Just coming by to say I'm sorry.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.605
Sorry for what?

19:32.639 --> 19:33.973
Quitting my job.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.308
I mean, I didn't know
how good I had it.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.445
Chris, if I paid you
minimum wage,

19:38.478 --> 19:40.913
you'd get taxed,
and I'd get taxed.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.882
I'd have to get
unemployment insurance,

19:42.915 --> 19:44.584
workmen's compensation.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.786
And there are
child labor laws.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.323
Look, the bottom line is,
if I paid you minimum wage,

19:50.357 --> 19:51.958
I'd have to close up the store.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.793
Years later,
Doc closed the store

19:53.826 --> 19:55.862
and opened a Wal-Mart.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.365
Oh. Well, thanks. See you later.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.999
Wait, wait, wait, Chris.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.435
If you want your job back,
it's yours.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.471
What about James?

20:04.504 --> 20:05.338
He quit.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.706
Here you go, Doc.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.007
You're working at Hoo's now?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.842
Yeah, man. That's a good job.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.379
I don't know
why you quit.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.715
He pays $67 a week cash.
No taxes.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.949
Must be
something wrong

20:16.983 --> 20:18.851
with you.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.887
I'd like to kick him
in the fortune cookies.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.922
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.955 --> 20:26.626
