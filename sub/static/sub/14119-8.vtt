00:33.834 --> 00:35.734
(SNIFFING) Mmm.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.737
(CONTINUES HUMMING)

00:38.739 --> 00:40.105
Bon appetit!

00:41.775 --> 00:42.975
What is it?

00:42.977 --> 00:44.443
It's a four cheese frittata!

00:44.445 --> 00:46.111
Oh, yeah?
What are the four cheeses?

00:46.113 --> 00:47.946
Cheddar, Swiss and Burrata.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.748
That's three cheeses.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.717
Why are you calling it
a four cheese frittata?

00:51.951 --> 00:53.552
Okay, it's an expression.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.187
PIGEON:
It's not an expression.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.423
It means,
you didn't follow the recipe.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.957
Probably why it tastes
like (BLEEP).

00:58.959 --> 01:01.660
(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)
Am I right? Ah?

01:02.028 --> 01:03.862
I will never high five you.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.065
Yes, thank you
for not high fiving that.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.267
Good morning, everybody!

01:08.269 --> 01:10.369
Okay, everybody,
we have a new mystery.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.704
Ooh, girl, is that
a four cheese frittata?
(SNIFFING)

01:12.706 --> 01:14.106

Michael, that's a hot skillet.

"Dear Mike Tyson Mystery Team,

Is this a joke?

01:48.975 --> 01:50.109
What are you taking about?

01:50.376 --> 01:51.743
How is this a mystery?

01:51.745 --> 01:55.481
Uh-uh! Not everything
has to be goblins and ghouls
and phantasms.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.417
Choosing a house involves
a bit of a mystery.

01:58.419 --> 02:01.153
What makes one gravitate
toward a Craftsman home

02:01.155 --> 02:02.754
while another might prefer
a Spanish style.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.357
Personally, I don't see
the charm in either,
I'm more of a Tudor man.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.558
Oh, you're a Tudor man, huh?

02:06.560 --> 02:10.129
I always figured you're more
of a two balls and a dick man.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.331
(LAUGHING) Am I right?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.465
Ah...

02:13.467 --> 02:14.800
Ugh.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.570
Now, let's go help Caitlyn,
Gary and Jasper find a house.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.808
Well, maybe we'll have
an early lunch.

02:37.390 --> 02:41.160
Hi, Mike, I'm Neil,
Caitlyn and Gary's realtor.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.195
Hi, nice to meet you,
I'm Mike.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.230
-Hi, Neil Mathers.
-Oh, that's Marquess.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.099
Hi, Neil. Nice to meet you.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.102
-Hi, Marquess, Gary Fewkes.
-Hello.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.737
-Hi, Gary.
-Hi, Mike.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.605
This is my wife, Caitlyn.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.774
-Hi, Caitlyn.
-Hello.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.676
-Hi, I'm Caitlyn.
-Hi.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.877
Oh, that's Yung Hee.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.012
-Hi, Yung Hee.
-Hi.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.980
-Am I pronounce... Yung Hee?
-Yeah.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.782
-I'm Gary.
-Okay.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.317
-Did you meet Neil?
-This is Neil.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.052
-Oh! Uh, yeah, hi. Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.687
-That's our realtor, Neil.
-Neil.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.755
Nice to meet you.
I'm Yung Hee.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.123
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you, Yung.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.125
My God!
Why does any of this matter?

03:13.127 --> 03:16.328
We're never going to see
each other after today.

03:16.663 --> 03:17.863
Oh, I'm sorry, this is Pigeon.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.899
Hi, Pigeon, Gary.
This is Caitlyn.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.234
-Hi, I'm Caitlyn.
-(BARKS)

03:22.236 --> 03:25.103
-Ooh, I forgot
about our dog, Jasper.
-Oh!

03:25.105 --> 03:28.540
-Hi, Jasper, I am Mike Tyson.
-He's a labradoodle.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.275
Jesus Christ!

03:32.445 --> 03:33.946
-Wow, it's so big.
-NEIL: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.480
-GARY: Wow.
-Oh, my gosh!

03:35.482 --> 03:37.583
NEIL: It is 3,000 square feet

03:37.585 --> 03:40.852
and Caitlyn,
it has the open floor plan
you were looking for.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.387
And you know what
I'm going to ask.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.290
Is this within
Caitlyn and Gary's budget?

03:45.292 --> 03:49.027
Well, it's a little over,
but it has four bedrooms,

03:49.029 --> 03:52.064
one of which could
easily be converted into
a man cave for you, Gary.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.099
(CHUCKLES) I like that.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.868
(GASPS) Oh, look at
all these windows.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.838
I love all this natural light.
It's like I've died
and gone to heaven.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.408
Hey, you've died all right,
but sadly for us
you're not in heaven.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.378
Neil, I'm noticing
a lot of stairs,

04:06.380 --> 04:08.547
how is that going
to work out for Jasper?

04:08.681 --> 04:10.882
Ooh, that'll be
an adjustment for him.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.918
We didn't have stairs
in San Jose.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.087
They don't have stairs
in San Jose?

04:15.089 --> 04:17.122
Okay, let me show you
how they work.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.890
It's very easy.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.293
You go right foot
and left foot,

04:22.161 --> 04:23.729
or left foot and right foot.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.598
It doesn't matter what foot,
that's what makes it so easy.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.303
And say hello
to your master bedroom
with <i> en suite.</i>

04:31.305 --> 04:33.939
(GASPS) O-M-G!

04:33.941 --> 04:36.441
Get in here, Caitlyn!
Run, don't walk!

04:36.709 --> 04:38.777
I could live in this closet.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.347
Well, you sure
can't seem to live out
of the closet, huh?

04:42.349 --> 04:44.483
(LAUGHING) Am I right?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.918
I don't get it,
but you're on fire today,
Pigeon.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.454
This open floor plan is
exactly what I'm looking for.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.756
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.759
And the yard
will be perfect for Jasper

04:53.761 --> 04:56.795
but, I gotta say,
I'm a little worried about
going over our budget.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.096
-Mmm. Mmm-hmm.
-Yeah?

04:58.564 --> 05:00.999
I do think this is a great
home for entertainment,

05:01.001 --> 05:04.136
but those stairs
and the high price tag, man,

05:04.138 --> 05:06.171
they have me very concerned.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.740
I think Neil needs to show us
more properties.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.142
I don't think we need to see
any more homes.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.611
Mystery solved,
this is the house.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.316
Huh. Well,
Caitlyn has pretty good tits.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.953
NEIL: Now,
this is a model home,

05:21.955 --> 05:23.655
but it will give you
a pretty good idea

05:23.657 --> 05:25.390
of houses in this development.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.292
It's a little smaller
than the last house

05:27.294 --> 05:30.896
but at $680,000,
it is right in your budget.

05:30.898 --> 05:31.997
MARQUESS: Okay, I hate it.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.234
Sorry, let's see inside.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.371
-I hate it!
-Slow down, Marquess.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.839
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.075
-Neil.
-Neil, where's
the bathroom at?

05:43.077 --> 05:44.509
There's a half bath
right over there

05:44.511 --> 05:47.779
and there are two
full bathrooms
off of the bedrooms.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.348
It just feels a little small.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.784
Yeah, and this location's
a lot further from my new job.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.387
-Not sure how I feel
about a commute.
-Mmm.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.923
I think, what Gary
and Caitlyn are learning

05:57.925 --> 06:00.926
is that for this price point,
they're gonna have
to make some sacrifices.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.594
(TAPPING KEYPAD)

06:02.596 --> 06:04.863
I don't even understand
why you're interviewing me.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.631
I don't care what (BLEEP)
house they get.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.166
This isn't a mystery.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.502
-(HORN HONKING)
-Let's go!

06:12.238 --> 06:14.740
Okay, I don't think
you should get this house
for two reasons.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.342
That half bath
has no shower in it.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.378
And also, something is wrong
with the plumbing

06:19.380 --> 06:20.912
because the toilet
doesn't flush.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.081
This is a model home,
there is no plumbing.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.350
Well, I just had
four cheese diarrhea,

06:25.352 --> 06:27.986
so we should probably
see another property, Neil.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.588
-Come on, Jasper.
-(BARKS)

06:32.959 --> 06:34.626
CAITLYN: Oh,
this is beautiful!
NEIL: Uh-huh.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.228
GARY: So much character.
NEIL: Uh-huh.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.730
Well, it's one
of the oldest homes
in Phoenix.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.166
It's five bedrooms,
three and a half baths

06:41.168 --> 06:42.934
and, it's close to your work.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.404
I don't even want to ask
how much it costs.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.539
(CHUCKLES)
That's the best part.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.141
It's way below budget.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.876
(BLEEP) Yeah, Neil.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.179
Let's take a look
at the inside.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.680
It's been completely updated.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.849
This is a complete
waste of time.

06:57.851 --> 07:02.020
They're never going to do
better than that first home.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.661
How on earth is this
under our budget?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.963
You know, I have no idea,
it's been on the market
for months,

07:11.965 --> 07:13.064
it's an incredible buy.

07:13.066 --> 07:16.134
Now I want to know
about the school district.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.004
Oh, well, uh, this is one
of the best in Phoenix.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.372
The middle school
is actually...

07:20.374 --> 07:22.073
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say,

07:22.075 --> 07:24.142
"I want to know
about the school district?"

07:24.144 --> 07:25.444
I meant to say,

07:25.446 --> 07:28.847
"I don't give a (BLEEP)
about the school district."

07:29.015 --> 07:30.782
I'll be in the car.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.225
(PIGEON HUMMING)

07:40.626 --> 07:42.227
-Oh, dear God!
-Ugh.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.862
I'll lock the doors
so he can't get in.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.398
No, not him, her!

07:52.839 --> 07:54.773
-Who?
-You don't see her?

07:57.076 --> 07:59.678
Open the door,
it's 1000 degrees out here.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.113
(GASPS) She must be a ghost.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.249
This place is haunted.
I have to warn them.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.617
YUNG: Yeah!
Finally a mystery.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.556
How am I supposed
to turn on the AC

08:11.558 --> 08:14.092
without the car keys,
you dumb bitch?

08:20.733 --> 08:22.100
(SCREAMS)

08:23.870 --> 08:25.470
Evil lives here!

08:25.738 --> 08:26.872
What are you seeing?

08:27.073 --> 08:29.007
(SCREAMING)

08:29.408 --> 08:33.411
(SOBBING) I can't! I can't!
It's too horrible.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.081
(GASPS)

08:37.884 --> 08:39.251
I have to warn them.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.090

(SCREAMING)

08:50.763 --> 08:52.497

08:53.566 --> 08:56.468
-Oh, I could definitely
see this as my man cave.
-Couldn't you?

08:56.470 --> 08:58.570
-I'm not going to be
allowed in here. (LAUGHING)
-Nope.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.005
She won't.
You won't let her in,
right?

09:00.007 --> 09:02.007
Stop! We have to leave.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.708
This is a house of horrors.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.411
Nice try, Marquess,
they're not gonna get
that first house

09:06.413 --> 09:07.779
just because you want it.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.147
It's out of their price range.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.016
I think
you should listen to him.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.586
And I think you should
listen to me
and I say, buy this house.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.790
-BOTH: We'll take it.
-(CHUCKLES)

09:30.636 --> 09:32.737
I'm reading this cartoon here

09:32.739 --> 09:34.639
and, uh,
there's a big elephant

09:34.641 --> 09:36.808
and it says
"the deficit" on it

09:36.810 --> 09:39.010
and it's sitting on a mouse

09:39.012 --> 09:42.847
and the mouse says...
(STUTTERING)

09:43.349 --> 09:46.251
"Home crisis housing."

09:47.086 --> 09:49.454
I don't understand
this cartoon.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.922
I like <i> Marmaduke.</i>

-Who are you even talking to?
-PIGEON: Ah? (LAUGHING)

09:53.060 --> 09:54.726
Who are you even talking to?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.962
Uh, just the... The room.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.797
Yeah, well,
the room's not listening.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.600
I was holding court.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.804
I don't get it,
we can see you,

10:05.806 --> 10:07.872
how come we couldn't see
those other ghosts?

10:07.874 --> 10:09.040
Oh, they were specters!

10:09.042 --> 10:11.343
One was a wraith.
As a stage-four phantasm,

10:11.345 --> 10:13.745
I have corporeal form,
but can still perceive...

10:13.747 --> 10:15.847
Boring.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.916
That couple was murdered!

10:17.918 --> 10:19.584
MARQUESS: What?
Oh, my God! (GASPS)

10:20.653 --> 10:22.654
"Gary and Caitlyn
were found butchered

10:22.656 --> 10:24.823
"in their recently
purchased home."

10:24.825 --> 10:26.057
Blah, blah, blah...

10:26.059 --> 10:29.594
Dog, Jasper,
also butchered. Jesus.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.729
No one listens to me.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.797
I said evil
lived in that home.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.432
I'll tell you
where evil lives.

10:35.202 --> 10:38.803
And why do I keep eating
these four cheese frittatas?

10:38.805 --> 10:39.938
(DOOR CLOSING)

10:58.524 --> 11:01.493
Oh, this is some bullshit
right here, man. What?

11:01.495 --> 11:05.263
"Three bedrooms, 2.7 million,"
give me a break!

11:05.265 --> 11:07.699
Come on, man,
this is just really rude.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.933
Uh...

11:08.935 --> 11:11.269
Oh, what company is this?
This is...

11:11.271 --> 11:13.238
Man, this is ridiculous, man.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.373
Can I say...
Can I say the company's name?
