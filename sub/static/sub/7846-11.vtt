<i>For your safety, please stop the vehicle</i>

20:04.450 --> 20:06.057
<i>and return to the passenger seat.</i>

20:06.060 --> 20:09.239
Looks like the only way
to survive is to crash.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.047
Too dangerous! Too dangerous!

20:20.488 --> 20:21.520
[ALL LAUGHING]

20:21.523 --> 20:23.052
Take that, you bucket of bolts.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.896
Oh, I'm sorry, is that offensive, or...

20:24.899 --> 20:26.565

[LAUGHS] Whoo-ooh!

20:36.449 --> 20:38.805
I'm alive! This is awesome!

20:38.808 --> 20:41.907
Aww, looks like somebody's first crash.

20:51.411 --> 20:53.095
Have a good day, Mr. McD.

20:53.098 --> 20:54.248
Nice work today, Launchpad.

20:54.251 --> 20:55.201
See you tomorrow.

20:55.204 --> 20:57.371
You're not gonna replace me?

20:57.374 --> 20:59.545
Replace you? Don't be daft.

20:59.548 --> 21:00.615
Where would I ever find a driver

21:00.617 --> 21:03.031
as crazy and dangerous as I am?

21:03.034 --> 21:06.365
Oh! Dewey told me about
your driver's license.

21:06.368 --> 21:08.368
Congratulations.

21:08.371 --> 21:10.204
[GRUNTS]

21:10.207 --> 21:13.308
Aww, your approval is all
the driver's license I need.

21:13.311 --> 21:15.311
Come on. [STRAINING]

21:15.314 --> 21:17.812
You should really keep the license.

21:21.055 --> 21:23.312
Sir, I was cleaning out my desk

21:23.315 --> 21:24.648
when suddenly the prototype armor

21:24.651 --> 21:27.058
burst from the chamber like
so many split atoms, and...

21:27.061 --> 21:29.443
Eh, save it. You're not fired...

21:29.446 --> 21:31.090
Gizmoduck.

21:31.093 --> 21:33.213
[SIGHS] Scrooge is always complaining

21:33.216 --> 21:35.066
my inventions are dangerous.

21:35.069 --> 21:37.171
This armor's gotta be 100% idiot proof,

21:37.174 --> 21:39.241
and, well, you're just
the idiot to prove it.

21:39.244 --> 21:41.439
Oh, thank you, sir!
You won't regret this.

21:41.442 --> 21:43.626
This project stays top
secret till it's out of beta.

21:43.629 --> 21:44.962
I won't tell a soul.

21:44.965 --> 21:46.343
[LAUNCHPAD] Bye, Gyro!

21:46.346 --> 21:47.503
Bye, Gizmoduck!

21:47.506 --> 21:48.909
From now on.

[SIGHS] Gizmoduck.

21:51.312 --> 21:52.910
What a stupid name.

21:56.350 --> 22:00.017
Gizmoduck... I must have him.
