WEBVTT

00:00.401 --> 00:00.901
Hey.

00:00.968 --> 00:01.802
Just ask him.

00:01.869 --> 00:02.936
No, I don't want
to bother him.

00:03.003 --> 00:03.937
Ask him!

00:04.004 --> 00:05.406
Fine.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.609
Mr. Gable, uh, if you're
going to Enzo's tonight,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.611
perhaps I could join you
for a pint.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.048
Why would we do that?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.584
Come on, Dad.
It'll be nice.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.419
And you never hang out
with Chale.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.653
We're hanging out
right now!

00:19.720 --> 00:21.255
We're -- We're awkward
kitchen buddies.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.691
It's kind of like
our thing, right?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.925
Absolutely.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.061
What we've got works for us,
right, Mr. Gable?

00:27.128 --> 00:28.429
Mm-hmm.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.664
Why do you always set me up
for failure?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.733
Hey, I just set you up.
The fail part was all you.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.504
Hey, honey, no one's
going to Enzo's today.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.038
Remember --
My cousin Irene is coming,

00:38.106 --> 00:40.208
and you said you'd entertain
Stuart while we catch up.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.442
( Sighing ) Ohhh.

00:41.509 --> 00:45.045
That's right --
Stuart Borington.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.580
Don't tell me
they're staying the night.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.016
I won't. They're staying
three nights.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.484
But we do a catch a break
during the day

00:50.551 --> 00:52.120
because he's got a convention
in the city.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.454
No, I --
I can't do it!

00:53.521 --> 00:55.022
The guy's brutal,
all right?

00:55.089 --> 00:56.624
He sucks the life
out of you.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.793
His stories are pointless,
and on top of that...

00:59.860 --> 01:01.495
he keeps a journal.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.030
A lot of people
keep a journal.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.933
A dream journal.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.535
Still, it's not so bad.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.303
And he tells you
about them.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.439
Yes, okay,
he's a little bit rough,

01:11.505 --> 01:13.574
but he's nowhere near as bad
as your Uncle Lou.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.509
Uncle Lou?
That man is a saint.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.077
Okay, that man
is over three bills

01:17.145 --> 01:19.947
and walked around our backyard
in a Speedo.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.882
That wasn't a Speedo.
They were regular shorts.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.417
It's just,
once he starts walking,

01:23.484 --> 01:24.852
everything
turns into a Speedo.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.455
It gets sucked up
into the vortex.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.522
( Knock at door )

01:28.589 --> 01:30.158
Oh. Rootger's here.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.992
Come in!
From next door?

01:32.059 --> 01:35.095
No -- Rutger Hauer,
star of "Blade Runner."

01:35.163 --> 01:36.096
Hi.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.298
Good morning, friends.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.200
I, uh, hate to pee-pee
in your Corn Flakes

01:39.267 --> 01:42.236
this early in the morning,
but look what I find.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.804
Are you kidding me?!
Yeah.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.639
I just made
that Jets mailbox.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.275
What kind of animal
would do this?

01:47.341 --> 01:50.911
The kind that wants
to up property values
in the neighborhood?

01:50.978 --> 01:53.947
Too soon, Donna.
Too soon.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.383
Well, we should call
the police.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.950
Oh, yeah, hey,
that's a good idea.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.352
"Hey, uh, could you get me
the police?"

01:58.419 --> 02:00.053
"Uh, sir,
you are the police."

02:00.120 --> 02:01.355
"That's right.
I keep forgetting.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.390
My wife makes me call" --

02:02.456 --> 02:04.958
Okay, all right,
honey.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.528
Uh, you're retired.
You're not the police anymore.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.962
Do you want me
to call them back?

02:09.029 --> 02:10.831
'Cause I'll call them back.
I have the number, all right?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.566
What are we gonna do?
We got to do
something about this,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.235
'cause whoever did this
thinks they got away with it.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.436
There's just gonna
go for it again.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.737
You know what?
I'm gonna call the guys.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.406
We're gonna set up
like a neighborhood watch.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.840
I want in.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.209
Criminals --

02:21.275 --> 02:23.277
They're like those, uh, bugs
that come into your house.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.378
Now, what do you
call them? Um...

02:24.445 --> 02:25.613
In Holland,
we call them kakkerlakken.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.047
Kakkerlakken?
Yeah, kakkerlakken.

02:27.114 --> 02:30.117
They come in, and they go...
( Imitates skittering )

02:30.184 --> 02:31.252
Oh, like termites?

02:31.319 --> 02:32.820
No. No, no, no.
( Scoffs )

02:32.886 --> 02:34.087
( Imitates skittering )

02:34.154 --> 02:35.256
Crickets. He's talking
about crickets.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.324
No crickets, no crickets.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.525
It's kakkerlakken.
You know, they...

02:37.591 --> 02:38.926
Kakkerlakken.
Oh, okay.

02:38.992 --> 02:39.927
Kakkerlakken.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.229
Kakkerlakken!
Oh, kakkerlakken!

02:41.295 --> 02:42.730
Kakkerlakken!
Right!

02:42.796 --> 02:44.498
Oh, yeah, we have those, too.
Okay, yeah.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.499
All right.
I'll see you tonight.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.534
Okay.
All right!

02:46.600 --> 02:48.135
Okay, but not tonight --
Stuart.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.438
Don't worry, sweetheart.
It's not gonna take long.
I promise.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.606
And then tomorrow night,
I will be back

02:52.673 --> 02:55.008
and I will hang out
with Stuart Borington.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.778
Stop calling him that,
because you say it
like a joke,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.213
and it's gonna slip out
when he's here.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.848
I mean, do I need
to remind you about

03:00.914 --> 03:05.118
that wonderful Thanksgiving
we spent with my Aunt Skanky?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.820
She's 72
and she's wearing a tube top.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.955
She earned that nickname.

03:09.557 --> 03:14.562
* I am not your ordinary guy

03:14.628 --> 03:16.464
So, I'm riding through
this castle

03:16.530 --> 03:18.098
on the back
of a velvet camel,

03:18.165 --> 03:20.200
but we're moving super-slow

03:20.268 --> 03:23.371
because the floors
are made of yogurt.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.106
Wow.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.141
That is quite the dream
right there.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.778
You know what --
It's actually time for me

03:30.844 --> 03:31.979
to get on my velvet camel,

03:32.045 --> 03:33.347
'cause I got to go out
and fight some crime.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.549
Uh, we have a little problem
in the neighborhood.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.884
Oh, that's terrible!

03:36.950 --> 03:39.320
You know, our neighbors
were making methamphetamine.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.421
What?!
Yes.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.923
The FBI came,
there were helicopters,

03:42.990 --> 03:44.157
this big shootout.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.159
A couple people died!

03:46.226 --> 03:47.528
So, what's going on here?

03:51.832 --> 03:54.134
It's kind of a, uh,
it's a mailbox situation.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.837
But, I mean, crime's crime,
right? I mean, so...

03:56.904 --> 03:59.206
All right, uh,
I'll see you guys later, then.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.541
Oh, no.
One sec, Kev.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.310
Before you leave, I kind of
wanted to tell you about

04:02.376 --> 04:03.944
our luggage fiasco
at the airport.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.579
Whoop!
That's my phone vibrating.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.681
That's a call to action
right there.
Okay.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.317
It's on the table, honey.
Yep.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.484
Saw it moving.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.287
Hey! Chale.
Uh, this is Stuart.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.390
He's got a great story for you
about luggage.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.625
Oh.
And you know what?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.393
This is a great time
to show you

04:19.460 --> 04:21.495
the bathroom
we wanted to remodel.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.663
Great!

04:27.468 --> 04:28.836
Do you keep
a dream journal?

04:31.605 --> 04:34.508
Man, these goggles
are unbelievable!

04:34.575 --> 04:36.710
I have the vision
of a barn owl.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.245
All right,
so, what's the plan here?

04:38.312 --> 04:39.547
Should we split
into teams?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.948
No, no, no, no.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.850
If they see us,
we'll scare them off,
all right?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.485
I've set up
the new mailbox.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.388
Now we just got to
wait for the kakkerlakken
to take the bait.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.522
Then we stomp them.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.823
( Laughs ) I like it!

04:49.890 --> 04:51.592
( Imitates skittering )

04:51.659 --> 04:53.060
And dead.
Mm-hmm.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.596
( Siren wails )

04:55.663 --> 04:57.130
Is that Dawson?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.368
Gable?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.702
What are you guys
doing?

05:01.769 --> 05:04.204
Just talking.
Sorry. Is that a problem?

05:04.271 --> 05:06.840
It is when I get a complaint
about four creepy guys

05:06.907 --> 05:08.842
sitting in a car
with binoculars.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.310
Night-vision goggles.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.212
And I can see
your tonsils.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.617
( Chuckling )
Wait. Are you guys on,
like, some sort of stakeout?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.919
( Inhales deeply, exhales )
That is adorable.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.422
Somebody trashed my mailbox
last night, all right?

05:21.489 --> 05:23.491
We didn't want
to bother you guys with it,

05:23.557 --> 05:24.892
so we thought
we'd handle it ourselves.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.961
Man, I heard about the retired
guys missing the action,

05:28.028 --> 05:29.530
but this is sad.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.866
Why don't you guys go get,
like, a hobby or something?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.569
I used to play pinochle
on Fridays.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.339
Guys, let's keep the weirdness
to a minimum.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.874
Okay.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.343
10-91.
It's all clear.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.547
Just four old guys
sitting in a car.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.582
Come on, he's right.
This is ridiculous!

05:48.649 --> 05:50.117
Yeah, if we're
looking for a guy,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.785
let's go out
and look for him.
Yeah!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.353
Whoa, whoa.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.022
Hold some phones.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.924
Here comes a kid
on a bike.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.158
Is that a golf club?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.593
That's our guy.
Let's go!

05:59.660 --> 06:02.029
Whoa, whoa, wait. Let's just
take a minute, all right?

06:02.095 --> 06:03.030
What do you mean?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.465
Let's kick him off
the bike,

06:04.532 --> 06:06.434
hold him down
till we get some answers.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.001
I like Rootger.
Yeah, let's move.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.671
Wait, wait, wait!
Guys, guys, it's not him.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.005
How do you know?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.907
Because it was me.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.143
What?

06:16.209 --> 06:19.012
You trashed
your own mailbox?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.280
I did.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.785
Honestly...

06:24.852 --> 06:27.387
this is a twist
I did not see coming.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.789
**

06:31.324 --> 06:33.193
So, you knock down
your own mailbox

06:33.260 --> 06:34.862
and start up
a neighborhood watch

06:34.928 --> 06:38.331
to avoid hanging out with
Donna's annoying relatives?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.501
All right.
We're caught up

06:40.568 --> 06:41.969
You're sick.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.837
Sick or brilliant?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.405
For a 30 buck mailbox,

06:45.473 --> 06:48.075
I came up with
the greatest escape plan ever.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.778
Great for you, but why do we
have to be out in the cold?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.245
'Cause you're part
of the illusion.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.647
Oh, yeah, well,
here's an illusion for you.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.816
Keep thinking I'm in your back
seat, 'cause I'm leaving!

06:55.883 --> 06:58.051
Yeah, I could be
in the comfort of my own home.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.687
Oh, really? How comfortable
are you gonna be

06:59.753 --> 07:01.955
when Didi makes you give her
a two-hour foot rub?

07:02.022 --> 07:02.956
Not cool!

07:03.023 --> 07:04.291
I told you that
in private!

07:04.357 --> 07:06.827
She has circulation issues!
You know this!

07:06.894 --> 07:08.128
So, you do want to be there
or you don't want to be there?

07:08.195 --> 07:09.262
Now,I'm confused!

07:09.329 --> 07:11.231
I don't want
to be there!
Okay!

07:11.298 --> 07:14.502
Everybody stop
your babies crying.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.637
I can fix this.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.039
**

07:19.106 --> 07:21.709
Now, this is how you do
a stakeout.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.511
Fake stakeout.
Yeah.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.646
Wow, man, this is
a sweet R.V.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.880
Where'd you get
this thing?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.215
You know that game show
"The Price is Right"?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.517
You were on that?

07:29.583 --> 07:32.385
No, no, no, my brother's
best friend, Dennis, was.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.288
Long story short --
couldn't pay the taxes,
got deported,

07:35.355 --> 07:37.324
dang dang dang,
bada bing, bada boom --

07:37.390 --> 07:39.493
well, here we are.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.663
Look at this! You got beer,
vodka -- you got everything!

07:42.730 --> 07:45.298
Well, you know
what they say --
"Go home or go big," right?

07:45.365 --> 07:46.500
( Chuckles )

07:46.567 --> 07:49.369
Actually, I think
it's "Go big or go home."

07:49.436 --> 07:50.704
I don't think so.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.340
You're probably right,
you're probably right, yeah.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.808
All right, boys,
who wants a cold one?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.276
Hit me up!
Yeah!

07:56.343 --> 07:58.846
Got to admit, Rootger,
this place is pretty cool.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.281
Pretty cool?
I'll tell you what's cool.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.983
35 speakers...

08:03.050 --> 08:05.085
and a subwoofer
in the couch.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.387
( Electronic music plays )

08:12.893 --> 08:14.261
Whoa-ho!

08:14.327 --> 08:16.296
Whoa!
Yeah!

08:16.363 --> 08:18.165
( Laughter )

08:26.339 --> 08:27.741
Donna: Hey!
Hey.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.309
How'd it go out there?
Any luck?

08:29.376 --> 08:30.510
Uh, no.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.112
Um, we thought
we caught the guy,

08:32.179 --> 08:34.247
but it turned out
it was just a possum

08:34.314 --> 08:35.983
eating fish sticks
out of the garbage can.

08:36.049 --> 08:36.950
Oh.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.752
We'll get them,
uh, tomorrow.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.554
Tomorrow? No!

08:40.621 --> 08:43.090
Honey, tomorrow, Irene and I
are having girls night,

08:43.156 --> 08:45.458
and you're supposed to
take Stuart off our hands.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.526
Okay, I'll do it.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.796
Okay, look, I know
that it's painful,

08:48.862 --> 08:49.997
Honey.
but I --

08:50.063 --> 08:52.199
Take "yes"
for an answer, hmm?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.102
Right. Okay.
All right?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.003
Thank you.
Okay.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.137
Thank you.
Let's go to bed.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.338
Okay.
I will be right up.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.707
I'm, uh, gonna get
a water.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.675
Do you need anything, or...?
Oh, no, I'm good.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.210
Okay, good.
I'll see you.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.382
( Clanking )

09:14.387 --> 09:15.388
Hey.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.290
Chale, I-I need
to ask you a favor.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.993
I can't sit
with Stuart anymore.
He's insufferable.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.229
This favor will make it so we
never have to
see Stuart again.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.831
Whatever it is,
I want in.
Good.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.398
There's a sledgehammer
in the shed --

09:25.465 --> 09:29.069
Oh, Mr. Gable, I can't!
That is too far!

09:29.136 --> 09:30.437
I don't want you
to hurt him.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.539
I just want you to knock down
the new mailbox.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.707
Why?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.676
So tomorrow night,
we can be back on patrol,

09:35.743 --> 09:37.444
far away
from the dream-weaver.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.646
Brilliant!

09:38.712 --> 09:39.579
Mm.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.981
But what if I get caught?

09:41.048 --> 09:43.250
You won't,
because you're smart
and you're sneaky.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.752
I mean, look how long
you've lived here,

09:44.818 --> 09:46.887
and I -- I've barely
noticed you, right?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.790
That's true.
Yes.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.358
( Chuckles )
All right.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.262
**

10:25.158 --> 10:26.326
Hey!
Hey!

10:26.393 --> 10:28.528
Kevin!
Hey!

10:28.595 --> 10:30.363
Honey, you're not
gonna believe this.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.999
They got us again!

10:32.065 --> 10:33.200
Are you kidding me?!

10:33.266 --> 10:35.836
You -- You turn your head
for one second...

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
Yeah, and not only that,

10:37.470 --> 10:40.473
but someone put a giant bag
of garbage
on your front stoop.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.075
Oh, actually, that was me.
I'm sorry.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.745
I forgot to take it out.
I totally...

10:44.812 --> 10:46.947
Maybe you and the guys
should go back out there.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.182
No! You guys got
your girls night out!

10:49.249 --> 10:51.184
Well,
we'll figure it out.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.419
All right,
I got to call the guys,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.487
tell them we're back on,
I guess.

10:58.792 --> 11:03.163
**

11:03.230 --> 11:05.165
And that's when the guy said,
"That's not my gate."

11:05.232 --> 11:07.200
( Laughing ) No, he didn't!
He said,
"That's not my gate."

11:07.267 --> 11:08.702
Ooh! Nachos
are ready, guys.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.370
( Cheering )

11:10.437 --> 11:12.172
Up next --
mini egg rolls.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.941
How you making out
over there, Chale?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.243
Martinis are done.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.444
Hey, hey!

11:17.510 --> 11:20.814
And we also have
Rootger's vermouth spritzer.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.550
Hey, if you're going to the
dance, fix your hair up nice.

11:23.616 --> 11:24.918
Am I right?

11:24.985 --> 11:26.987
Yes, you are.
All right.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.989
Hey, so, how many mailboxes
did you go through?

11:29.056 --> 11:31.258
Uh, just the two.
I destroyed the first one.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.659
Chale got the second.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.829
Hey! Way to step up, Chale.
You're all right, man.

11:35.896 --> 11:36.964
Thank you.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.599
And, uh, I am very grateful
to Mr. Gable

11:39.666 --> 11:43.436
for having the confidence
in me to let me
join his crime spree.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.906
Ooh! Can you set
my garbage pails on fire?

11:45.973 --> 11:48.976
My mother has
a mah-jongg group
coming over on the 18th.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.578
Actually, that week is
a bit of a bear for me,

11:51.644 --> 11:53.146
but, uh,
I can juggle.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.281
( Laughter )

11:54.347 --> 11:55.983
I need you
the beginning of May.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.650
Didi's mother's
turning 90.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.086
She wants a bounce house.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.788
She's pretty much
cottage cheese up there now.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.555
Okay.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.225
Guys, guys, look,
there's enough fake vandalism
to go around

12:05.292 --> 12:06.927
for everybody,
all right?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.161
Yeah, you're right.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.463
Yeah, to Kev. Huh?
The mastermind.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.599
No, to freedom, huh?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.467
All: Freedom!

12:14.534 --> 12:16.636
And to me,
the mastermind! Ha!

12:16.703 --> 12:19.807
**

12:19.873 --> 12:21.408
So, this is
our wheaten terrier.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.244
She's 13, but she acts
so much younger.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.147
Yeah, I mean, if it weren't
for the milky eyes,

12:27.214 --> 12:29.649
she'd look like a puppy.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.418
Yeah, you know, guys,
I really got to study, so...

12:31.484 --> 12:33.020
No, no, no, you're good.
You can stay.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.455
Oh, no, Mom. You know I can't
'cause I got that --
that test.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.490
But you already get
straight A's, you brainiac.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.759
So sit down.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.528
She works so hard.
( Laughs )

12:41.594 --> 12:43.163
You're hurting me.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.498
And here she is
eating a bully stick.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.000
She cannot get enough
of that one.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.102
Oh, honey, nobody
wants to see that.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.403
Show them the one
at the beach.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.438
Yeah, go forward.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.305
Go forward.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.140
Go forward.

12:53.206 --> 12:53.907
Not that one.

12:53.974 --> 12:54.942
Go forward.

12:55.008 --> 12:55.943
No, go forward.

12:56.009 --> 12:56.977
Go forward.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.178
That's -- No.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.112
Go forward.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.180
Yeah, almost.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.648
No. I think
it's a different folder?

13:01.714 --> 13:03.116
Go forward.
Go forward.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.252
Okay, I got to go!

13:05.318 --> 13:06.453
Here she is.
Oh!

13:06.519 --> 13:08.555
Aw.
What a day.
( Chuckles )

13:08.621 --> 13:10.523
Man, I wish
Kevin were here to see this.

13:11.859 --> 13:12.893
So do I.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.897
( Electronic music plays )

13:16.964 --> 13:19.232
Ohh!
Wha!

13:19.299 --> 13:20.433
( Laughing ) Oh!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.269
Oh, ah! Oh!

13:22.335 --> 13:24.071
That's water!
That was water!
Boom!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.906
All: Oh!

13:25.973 --> 13:28.008
Chale: Oh, oh, oh.
Whoa!

13:28.075 --> 13:28.675
Whoa!

13:28.741 --> 13:29.843
Whoa!

13:29.910 --> 13:31.211
Hoo! Ooh, ooh!

13:31.278 --> 13:32.079
Ohh!

13:32.145 --> 13:34.781
All: Oh!

13:34.848 --> 13:36.816
Goody is
the new champion!

( Music stops )

13:45.225 --> 13:46.393
Stuart.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.262
Sounds like you guys
are having a lot of fun.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.730
Room for one more?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.701
Oof. Buzzkill.

**

13:59.839 --> 14:01.841

14:01.909 --> 14:03.376
So, now
we're at the carousel.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.013
Still no sign of our bags.
( Chuckles )

14:06.079 --> 14:08.615
I look over at the, uh,
rental car outlet.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.150
What do you think
I see?

14:11.851 --> 14:12.886
Your bags?

14:14.922 --> 14:17.024
Yes.
Both of them.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.159
( Laughing )
How wild is that?!

14:22.095 --> 14:24.597
Boy, that story
just laid there
like a dead fish.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.936
Just me?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.071
You know what? We're getting
so caught up listening to Stu.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.941
Um, Duff, when is --
when is the next patrol?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.175
Oh. Uh...

14:35.242 --> 14:36.476
You know what?
That's right now.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.777
Yeah.
Uh, Goody, you're up.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.012
Wait a second. No, you --
you went already, right?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.780
Yeah.
Oh, then you, uh --

14:40.847 --> 14:42.482
Everybody's been
around the horn.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.118
Um, uh, Stu,
you want to give it a shot?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.253
You want me
to go out?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.655
Yeah, I mean, look,
we went out already,

14:48.721 --> 14:49.889
and none of us
had any luck,

14:49.957 --> 14:52.492
so, uh...yeah.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.826
I'm in.
Okay.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.595
What do I do?
Well, you just --
you go out,

14:55.662 --> 14:58.265
you head north, right,
and then you loop it
back around.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.334
You come back south, and you
just, like, repeat that...

15:01.401 --> 15:03.836
s-seven times.

15:05.872 --> 15:06.873
Got it!

15:08.041 --> 15:09.409
Oh, hey, and if, uh,
you get lost,

15:09.476 --> 15:12.612
you just, uh,
follow the moon.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.813
So, what am I
looking for?

15:13.880 --> 15:14.982
Oh, uh, well, the guy

15:15.048 --> 15:16.716
knocked down my mailbox,
uh, twice.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.352
It's a Jets mailbox, so it's,
um -- I'd look for somebody

15:19.419 --> 15:21.854
who's not a Jet fan,
I guess, right?

15:21.921 --> 15:22.789
Yeah.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.424
( Laughing )
All right.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.858
Oh, my God.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.429
Man,
that guy can kill a room.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.301
I have a video
of a bear on a trampoline.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.535
What are we waiting for?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.437
Let's do it.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.406
**

15:39.472 --> 15:40.640
Ohh!
Ohh!

15:40.707 --> 15:42.209
That bear
just did a flip!

15:42.275 --> 15:43.743
Wow, that's amazing!

15:43.810 --> 15:46.846
( Bear growls )
Legs get stuck
in the springs.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.615
Fur goes everywhere.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.917
( Roaring )
Camera guy
gets too close.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.119
Oh, yeah,
bear gets angry.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.621
I got to stop this.
It gets a little dark.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.224
Who is it?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.092
It's Stuart!
I found him!

15:59.159 --> 16:01.361
I know who did it!

16:02.929 --> 16:05.298
( Breathing heavily )

16:05.365 --> 16:06.633
No doubt about it.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.469
This vehicle belongs
to the guy you're looking for.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.271
I-I-I don't --
I don't think so, man.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.372
Kevin, come on. Look.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.806
There's a Patriots sticker
right there,

16:13.873 --> 16:15.442
and out in front,
there's a little dent

16:15.508 --> 16:17.244
where he hit
the mailbox!

16:17.310 --> 16:19.146
T-This car belongs
to Mr. Ferguson.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.581
L-Let's just go back
to the RV. Come on.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.816
No. Not this time.

16:24.951 --> 16:25.752
What are you doing?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.320
Serving justice!

16:27.387 --> 16:29.622
What?!
There's no justice! No!

16:29.689 --> 16:31.458
( Air hisses )
No! Stuart!

16:31.524 --> 16:33.726
Stuart!
He didn't do it!

16:33.793 --> 16:36.496
( Air hisses )
Mr. Ferguson --
he's in a wheelchair!

16:39.999 --> 16:41.568
Don't believe
the sticker.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.869
That's for good parking.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.805
Kevin, I'm gonna do
what I should have done

16:45.872 --> 16:47.974
to those meth heads
in Santa Fe --

16:48.041 --> 16:49.642
take back
the neighborhood!

16:51.511 --> 16:53.880
That felt great!

16:53.946 --> 16:55.282
Quick --
let's get out of here.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.288
Whoa. That guy
is sick in the melon.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.956
Okay, look, we --
we got to fix those tires

17:04.023 --> 17:05.658
a-and replace the window --
quick.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.195
All right, w-what's the name
of that 24-hour glass place?

17:08.261 --> 17:09.829
The one that advertises
all the time.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.664
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, the name's in the jingle
in the song.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.665
It's, uh...

17:12.732 --> 17:14.267
( High-pitched vocalizing )

17:14.334 --> 17:15.802
* We're there for you

17:15.868 --> 17:17.737
No, no, no, no.
You're going up.
You should go down.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.439
( Vocalizing )

17:19.506 --> 17:21.040
* Something, something
auto glass *

17:21.108 --> 17:23.576
( All vocalizing )

17:23.643 --> 17:25.945
* Brand-new glass
will make you feel merry *

17:26.012 --> 17:28.715
* At our new location
in West... *

17:28.781 --> 17:29.816
* Westbury

17:29.882 --> 17:31.418
Both:
* Westbury Auto Glass!

17:31.484 --> 17:32.585
( Laughter )

17:32.652 --> 17:34.387
You did it!

17:34.454 --> 17:35.522
( Sirens wailing )

17:35.588 --> 17:36.956
Oh.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.791
My green card's
a little sketchy.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.360
I got to go.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.935
**

17:52.805 --> 17:55.475
All right, so,
I've been through everything
with Mr. Ferguson,

17:55.542 --> 17:57.444
and, uh, he's willing
to drop the charges.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.745
( Sighs )

17:58.811 --> 18:00.980
As long as you guys pay
for the car window and tires.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.615
Oh, absolutely.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.583
Oh, and the fence.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.685
The fence?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.754
It's a long story.
Uh-huh.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.990
Mr. Ferguson, I-I-I just want
to say I'm sorry,

18:11.057 --> 18:14.427
and I personally want
to thank you for your service

18:14.494 --> 18:17.997
and let you know that
your sacrifices
for our country

18:18.064 --> 18:20.133
do not go unnoticed.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.234
Oh, this.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.803
Uh, no, I was
in Costa Rica ziplining.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.338
I overshot the pool.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.709
Either way,
you have our thanks.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.312
( Knock on door )

18:32.379 --> 18:34.481
Guess who missed their flight!
But good news.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.650
I got a couple hours
to tell you
a whale of a story.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.352
First of all,
Irene is in tears.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.921
I'm saying to her,
"Irene, what? Is it the dog?

18:41.988 --> 18:43.623
Is it the cat?
We don't even have a cat."

18:43.690 --> 18:45.124
See, I'm trying
to make her laugh.
I'm getting out.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.393
She's not laughing.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.927
I said to her, "Listen to me.
We have options."

18:47.994 --> 18:49.562
We have money.
I don't have a great job.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.898
I've got a good job.
I can afford another flight.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.767
Next thing I know, I might not
be able to get another flight.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.669
Turns out there are
weather conditions

18:56.736 --> 18:59.872
that one is not always
"in control of."

18:59.939 --> 19:02.309
I do remember
thinking to myself
there was one time

19:02.375 --> 19:04.644
where I was considering
being a pilot myself.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.514
That way, I wouldn't
have to be dependent
on other people.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.616
Chances are
it's something I could do...

19:09.682 --> 19:12.985
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

19:13.052 --> 19:16.523
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

19:16.589 --> 19:18.725
* Do, do, do, do, do

19:18.791 --> 19:20.260
* Do, do, do, do

19:20.327 --> 19:23.863
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

19:23.930 --> 19:26.933
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

19:26.999 --> 19:29.569
* I just don't want no...
