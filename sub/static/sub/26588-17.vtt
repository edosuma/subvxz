00:01.120 --> 00:04.880
Dre: For a Black man,
breaking into my field

00:04.880 --> 00:07.250
wasn't as easy
as you might think.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.500
Crowd:
"No Dre, no way!"

00:08.500 --> 00:11.000
Okay. That was
an exaggeration.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.460
But let's be honest --

00:14.460 --> 00:18.500
even now, Stevens & Lido
isn't brimming with diversity.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.170
And when I was first hired,

00:20.170 --> 00:22.670
I quickly figured out
why I was there.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.920
Uh, excuse me.
New guy.

00:24.920 --> 00:28.670
Where do Black people
buy their laundry detergent?

00:28.670 --> 00:29.670
The store.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.120
Knew it.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.540
We have an expert
right here.

00:33.540 --> 00:34.710
Andre.

00:34.710 --> 00:37.460
When you're talking
low-interest home loans,

00:37.460 --> 00:40.120
do you do so with your "homies"
or with your "boyzzz"?

00:41.380 --> 00:42.500
My "boyzzz."

00:42.500 --> 00:45.960
Um, are your people
still saying "Yo"?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.170
Yeah.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.710
But thanks to my trailblazing,

00:49.710 --> 00:53.080
I've paved the way
for a few more Black faces,

00:53.080 --> 00:54.710
like my assistant Curtis,

00:54.710 --> 00:58.000
or Junior, who turned
an internship into a job.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.380
Man, so much has gone on since
we last talked this morning!

01:02.380 --> 01:05.460
Josh is taking me to lunch
to share some industry intel.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.330
Did you know
that there is a secret meeting

01:07.330 --> 01:09.330
to decide
the new flavor obsession?

01:09.330 --> 01:12.710
Pumpkin spice is out --
garlic maple is in.

01:12.710 --> 01:15.250
Garlic maple?
What?!

01:15.250 --> 01:17.620
All right, I gotta go
scrub in again, sweetie.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.620
All right.
Bye, hon!

01:18.620 --> 01:21.380
Lunch with Josh?

01:21.380 --> 01:23.960
Why does he suddenly
care about you?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.080
Because he's my mentor?

01:26.290 --> 01:27.500
Garlic maple!

01:27.500 --> 01:29.040
Yeah! So hype!

01:30.790 --> 01:31.790
What the --

01:37.120 --> 01:39.000
Sometimes
you gotta take a chance

01:39.000 --> 01:40.500
when you're making
a pitch.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.710
Risks are opportunities
wrapped in barbed wire.

01:43.710 --> 01:45.580
Wow. I mean,
they really are.

01:45.580 --> 01:48.170
Man, look at this
ebony and ivory atrocity

01:48.170 --> 01:49.540
going on over there.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.750
It's unnatural...
Mm.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.290
...like eating chicken and eggs
at the same time.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.540
Or eating an egg
while you make a chicken watch.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.790
What?

01:57.790 --> 01:59.000
They hate that.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.460
That's why I do it.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.120
Huh. What's this,
the Black people meeting?

02:03.120 --> 02:05.790
Josh is mentoring
Junior.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.380
He is?
Mm-hmm.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.170
That's just
unnatural.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.330
It's like a Black man
with chin hair and no mustache.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, that's -- that's --
that's crazy.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.710
Josh is
up to something.

02:19.710 --> 02:22.500
So, I was thinking about
the Gumdrop Speaker campaign.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.500
So, what if
during the spot,

02:25.500 --> 02:28.750
someone eats the speaker,
like a piece of candy,

02:28.750 --> 02:32.000
and every time they open
their mouth, music comes out?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.620
I mean, it's like
the music is always with them.

02:34.620 --> 02:35.620
Junior...

02:35.620 --> 02:36.960
that's great!

02:36.960 --> 02:38.710
And I like how you used
those persuasive metaphors

02:38.710 --> 02:40.250
we talked about
at lunch.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.830
And I like
how you didn't cry

02:41.830 --> 02:43.710
when the waitress
wouldn't give you her number.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.290
You are toughening up.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.000
Thank you, dude.
All right.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.210
Oh, hey. Mr. Stevens.
Yeah?

02:49.210 --> 02:52.250
I got a great new idea for
the Gumdrop Speaker campaign.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.380
Okay, what if
someone eats the speaker,

02:54.380 --> 02:56.830
and every time they open
their mouth, music plays?

02:56.830 --> 02:58.580
Mnh-mnh.
You know, like the music
is always with them.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.290
Wow, I actually like that
quite a bit.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.000
He's taking
Junior's idea.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.920
Hmm.
Classic move.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.290
White man's
been putting his name

03:05.290 --> 03:07.620
on our innovations
for centuries.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.420
Of course Elvis was the king,

03:10.420 --> 03:13.790
but a lot of people don't know
that his biggest influence

03:13.790 --> 03:15.120
was Black musicians who --
Charlie: Hold up, Dre.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.500
What?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.460
And like I said,
it was all Junior's idea.

03:19.710 --> 03:23.670
What we actually witnessing
is even more classic-er.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.420
Black man needing a White man
to jump-start his career.

03:26.420 --> 03:28.620
Charlie:
Mike Tyson needed Cus D'Amato.

03:28.620 --> 03:30.880
"12 Years a Slave"
needed Brad Pitt.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.380
And Shaq needed that little
White boy to make a wish.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.250
Oh, my God.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.670
This White man only has
good intentions for my son.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.420
Yeah,
he's Pat Riley-ing him.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.830
He doesn't need
a Pat Riley.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.460
He's got me.
Hmm.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.330
And everybody knows
that I'm the person

03:47.330 --> 03:49.080
that Black people
should look up to.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.080
I don't look up to you.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.210
I'm half your height,
and I don't look up to you.

03:53.210 --> 03:55.040
You know what? I'm gonna go
down to the Boys & Girls Club

03:55.040 --> 03:57.960
and find somebody who hasn't
even ever seen a commercial

03:57.960 --> 03:59.540
and I'm-a make them
the best.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.210
Or you could just mentor
your assistant, Curtis.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.040
Even better.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.620
Saves me a trip.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.960
You know what?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.710
This is the most productive
Black people meeting

04:08.710 --> 04:10.460
that we ever had.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.710
Remember
what we just did.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.830
Emerson:
Check out my mom.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.830
My mom is so dumb.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.290
She really
hurt herself.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.290
You think this is funny?
Check out our mom.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.380
Yes! Yes!

04:31.380 --> 04:33.620
♪ Okay, okay ♪
Oh! Okay.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.170
♪ All day, I slay ♪

04:36.170 --> 04:38.710
Beyoncé: ♪ Okay, ladies,
now let's get in formation ♪

04:38.710 --> 04:39.710
♪ Okay, ladies ♪

04:39.710 --> 04:41.040
Hey!

04:41.040 --> 04:42.330
You guys, this is private time!

04:42.330 --> 04:44.120
She gets, like, 9 seconds a day
away from her family,

04:44.120 --> 04:45.540
and that's
what she does with it.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.460
So dumb.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.790
Yeah.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.250
And her butt.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.460
So dumb.

04:50.460 --> 04:51.460
Her what?

04:51.460 --> 04:52.750
Here.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.790
Let's zoom in
on how dumb her butt is.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.620
Dude, that's my mom.

04:56.620 --> 04:58.540
Yeah, it is.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.000
She ever talk
about me?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.710
-Huh?
-Hmmm...wha...?

05:03.710 --> 05:05.790
Hello, children!

05:05.790 --> 05:06.880
How was school?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.540
Baffling.
Why?

05:08.540 --> 05:10.380
Jack showed his friends
your Beyoncé video,

05:10.380 --> 05:11.920
and now everyone thinks
you're the hot mom.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.580
Wh--

05:13.580 --> 05:14.580
Me?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.080
Yeah.
I don't get it, either.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.620
Can we just
switch the subject?

05:17.620 --> 05:20.210
I-Iran. A-Are those sanctions
ever gonna end?

05:20.210 --> 05:21.710
No, no, Jack.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.040
We are going to
talk about this...
Rainbow: Yes.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.290
...because this
makes zero sense.
Okay.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.210
Our school is stocked
with trophy wives.
Yeah.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.460
Tucker's mom is
a former Miss Alabama.
Yeah.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.710
How are you
the hot mom?

05:30.710 --> 05:32.420
Oh, w-- I'm sorry.
Uh, did y--

05:32.420 --> 05:34.670
Did you --
Did you say the hot mom?

05:34.670 --> 05:36.790
Not a hot mom,
but the hot mom?

05:36.790 --> 05:39.500
Really? This is what
we're really talking about?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.500
Well...

05:40.500 --> 05:42.290
What about the bees,
you know?

05:42.290 --> 05:44.210
Haven't heard about the bees
in a while. They all right?

05:44.210 --> 05:46.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I understand. I understand.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.790
No need for you
to be embarrassed, okay?

05:47.790 --> 05:49.880
It's just --
It's what little boys do.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.710
You know
what I mean?

05:50.710 --> 05:51.960
They're just...

05:51.960 --> 05:53.920
They're obsessed with...

05:53.920 --> 05:55.880
...your very hot doctor mom.
It's okay.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.000
That's the problem.
Oh.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.670
Tone it down, Mom.
Mm.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.540
You're holding it together
pretty well for 35,

06:00.540 --> 06:02.120
but right now,
just ease up.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.710
Do you really think
your mom is 35?

06:04.710 --> 06:06.250
You're not 35?

06:06.250 --> 06:08.120
Well, if you think
I look 35 --

06:08.120 --> 06:09.790
She's not --
Do I look 35?

06:09.790 --> 06:11.120
Dah!

06:11.120 --> 06:12.500
Go to your room.

06:14.710 --> 06:16.330
Hey.

06:16.330 --> 06:17.580
I'm about to change
your life, Curtis.

06:17.580 --> 06:19.210
Okay.
Okay.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.460
I've decided
to mentor you.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.750
Oh. Oh, wow.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.670
Um...really?

06:24.670 --> 06:25.670
Mm-hmm.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.620
Uh, you as my mentor?

06:27.620 --> 06:28.960
You're welcome.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.290
Uh, no, no, no, no.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.120
I didn't -- I didn't --
I mean...

06:32.120 --> 06:34.830
I didn't think of you
as the mentoring type.

06:34.830 --> 06:36.920
What?
No, it's cool.
It's cool. I --

06:36.920 --> 06:39.380
You're just one of those dudes
that doesn't give back.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.880
Curtis, what are you
talking about, man?

06:40.880 --> 06:42.420
I'm always
helping you out.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.580
You are my main man,
Special K!

06:45.580 --> 06:47.330
See, that --
that's it right there.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.880
Um...
What?

06:48.880 --> 06:50.790
My name is Curtis...

06:50.790 --> 06:52.580
with a "C."

06:52.580 --> 06:54.420
Oh.

06:54.420 --> 06:57.500
I-I always thought
it was with a K...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.080
like Kurtis Blow.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.000
I know. You say it every time
you introduce me to a client.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.670
So once.

07:03.670 --> 07:04.670
Curtis.

07:06.210 --> 07:07.960
Let me mentor you.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.580
You know what?
Um...

07:09.580 --> 07:12.330
I appreciate the offer, boss,
but, uh, I'm-a go ahead

07:12.330 --> 07:13.960
and get me
some of that Josh mentoring.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.920
Yeah. Thank you.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.790
Hey! Get in here,
Vitamin C!

07:17.790 --> 07:19.540
Come on.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.620
How you doing?

07:22.210 --> 07:23.960
Wow.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.750
I haven't seen someone lose
that many young Black people

07:26.750 --> 07:29.000
since Kanye started talking
about Trump.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.170
Have you?

07:32.830 --> 07:34.710
If you have,
you would tell me, right?

07:37.380 --> 07:39.420
I'm here for you.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.920
I'm over 30,
but...I still matter.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.380
The hot mom --
over Miss Alabama?

07:49.380 --> 07:50.620
What?

07:50.620 --> 07:52.960
Bow, forget Miss Alabama,
all right?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.120
Can you believe
that Curtis

07:54.120 --> 07:55.710
doesn't think
I'm the mentoring type?

07:55.710 --> 07:57.250
Well...

07:57.250 --> 08:00.040
Can you name someone that's
opened more doors than me?

08:00.040 --> 08:01.120
Well...
Huh? Name somebody.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.920
Okay, well, I --
Anybody!

08:02.920 --> 08:04.500
Well, I'll start with --
See? You can't even name
one person, Bow.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.120
You can't name one.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.540
I --
All right?

08:07.540 --> 08:09.750
If it wasn't for me,
Curtis wouldn't have a job,

08:09.750 --> 08:12.420
Charlie wouldn't have a job,
and Junior wouldn't have a job.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.000
Dre!

08:14.000 --> 08:16.670
You didn't hire Charlie,
and you didn't hire Junior.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.040
But I created the environment
for them to get hired.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.290
Oh, really?
See?

08:20.290 --> 08:22.420
By leading by example...
Uh-huh.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.500
...I've given them
the blueprint to success.
Oh.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.540
Stay woke, Bow.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.290
Okay, I don't think
you understand

08:27.290 --> 08:28.460
the meaning of "woke."

08:28.460 --> 08:29.790
Oh, I'm wide awoke --
Yeah.

08:29.790 --> 08:32.210
Eyes wide woke.
Sure.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.330
And once I've gotten them
through the door...
Mm-hmm.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.500
...what else am I
supposed to do?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.710
Mentoring, Dre.

08:36.710 --> 08:39.420
It's about bringing along
the next generation.

08:39.420 --> 08:41.540
In the medical field,
we have a little saying --

08:41.540 --> 08:44.880
"You see one, you do one,
you teach one." Okay?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.880
So you see a surgery,
you do a surgery,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.500
and then
you teach that surgery

08:49.500 --> 08:51.250
to those that are
coming up behind you.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.290
You just, pftt, bring 'em along.
Okay, w-w-w-w-w-w-wait.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.290
Yes?
So...

08:54.290 --> 08:56.790
you see one surgery...
Mm-hmm.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.830
...then you're
able to do it?
N--

08:58.830 --> 09:00.790
Okay.
I've played Operation.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.960
Can I scrub in?

09:01.960 --> 09:03.540
It's a metaphor!

09:03.540 --> 09:06.620
Babe, I've opened the door
for many people.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.080
Dre, if you feel like you have
more to offer than Josh,

09:09.080 --> 09:11.380
then fight
to be a mentor.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.460
You're giving me
a lot to think about.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.580
That's what I do.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.120
Like,
what do you guys do

09:16.120 --> 09:18.380
for seven years
in medical school?

09:18.380 --> 09:21.000
I'm too hot
for this conversation.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.960
Dre: My super-hot wife
was right.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.210
I needed to be a MILF --

09:28.210 --> 09:29.880
A Mentor I'd Like to Follow.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.710
Now, th--
that's great advice.

09:31.710 --> 09:34.790
We are gonna be much better
fathers because of this.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.710
Hey, guys.
Come on, you two. All right?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.290
You need a Black mentor
to teach you the Black ropes.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.290
My office, now.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dre, what's going on?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.750
Sorry, Josh, there are just some
lessons that you can't teach.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.040
Uh, I don't know.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.540
I feel like things have been
going pretty well so far.

09:46.540 --> 09:47.290
Right, guys?

09:47.290 --> 09:48.330
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.960
Yeah, it's been going
really well.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.170
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:51.170 --> 09:52.750
All right, well,
what would you say they do

09:52.750 --> 09:54.580
if they're in
the middle of a meeting

09:54.580 --> 09:58.290
and are asked to be the
mouthpiece for all Black people?

09:58.290 --> 09:59.750
Hmm?

09:59.750 --> 10:00.710
Does that happen?

10:00.710 --> 10:02.540
It -- It happens.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.460
Y-Yeah, it -- it happened
on the way to this meeting.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.750
Mm. See?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.380
Black people
need different things.

10:07.380 --> 10:11.250
So from now on, I will mentor
Curtis and Junior.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.000
Okay?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.710
Okay.

10:13.710 --> 10:14.750
What about Zion?

10:14.750 --> 10:16.330
Who's Zion?

10:16.330 --> 10:17.790
Is there a brother here
named Zion

10:17.790 --> 10:19.040
that I don't know about?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.290
Zion!

10:20.290 --> 10:21.290
Yeah.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.710
I started last month.
You hired me.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.960
You said, "Zion?
That's a weird name for a girl."

10:26.960 --> 10:28.290
You're mine, too.

10:28.290 --> 10:29.670
Let's go, guys.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.880
And Zion.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.040
Josh: Guys?

10:36.330 --> 10:37.670
Yeah! Whoo!

10:37.670 --> 10:38.790
Yes, yes, yes!

10:38.790 --> 10:40.170
Go, Valley -- Okay.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.960
Uh -- uh,
good half, guys!

10:41.960 --> 10:43.380
Such a good half!

10:43.380 --> 10:45.120
Yeah, bring it in.
All right.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.540
Hey!

10:46.540 --> 10:50.080
"Orange" you glad
I sliced up some snacks?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.790
Good one, Dr. Bow.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.080
Thank you.
Oh, please.
You know it's not.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.710
Oh, c--
come on.

10:54.710 --> 10:57.500
Hey, how are things
with you, Dr. J?

10:57.500 --> 10:58.790
Truly?

10:58.790 --> 11:00.460
They're fine, Mason.
Everything's fine.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.750
So, what have you done lately
that's...just for you?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.790
Um...oh.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.250
Okay.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.500
I'll tell you
in one second, kiddo.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.880
What the heck?
What are
you talking about?

11:10.880 --> 11:11.960
I thought you said
you were gonna tone it down.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.290
Look at you!
What?

11:13.290 --> 11:14.960
I -- I'm dressed
like all the other moms.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.580
Please.

11:16.580 --> 11:18.000
You really think the boys
are here to see Joanne?

11:19.710 --> 11:22.120
Don't play naive.
This is Jack you're talking to.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.290
Yes,
I know who you are.

11:23.290 --> 11:25.000
I've been watching you flirt
all day.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.170
Flirt? What?

11:27.170 --> 11:28.250
What are you
talking about?

11:28.250 --> 11:30.120
"Great half, guys.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.380
I've brought
orange slices.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.790
Water helps
with cramps."

11:32.790 --> 11:34.710
You want me to just
let lactic acid build up

11:34.710 --> 11:36.080
in the muscles
of these children?

11:36.080 --> 11:37.210
Oh, I don't think so.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.960
Listen to me.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.250
I'm not doing anything.
Nothing.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.920
You are seeing things
that aren't there.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.000
Am I?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.040
Yes, sweetheart,
I promise.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
I'm j--
Joshua: Ow!

11:46.040 --> 11:47.460
Oh! Ooh!
My leg!

11:47.460 --> 11:49.330
Is there a female doctor
in the house?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.790
Perhaps...
a supple anesthesiologist?

11:53.790 --> 11:55.120
This is a nightmare.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.000
Yes, okay. I see it now.
I got you.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.540
Okay, so the rapper --
w-whoever's hot at the time...

12:00.540 --> 12:01.830
Mm-hmm.
Right, right.

12:01.830 --> 12:03.920
...he ties his shoes too tight
and says...

12:03.920 --> 12:06.330
"Ooh!
These too tight!"
Yeah.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.880
And then we widen out
and we see...

12:08.880 --> 12:10.880
Name, logo here.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.580
"These too tight."

12:12.580 --> 12:15.000
Whoo!
What do you think?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.670
I think it's terrible.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.040
Whoa.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.880
Guys, take a seat.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.170
All right.

12:23.170 --> 12:27.710
Advertising isn't just
about selling a product.

12:27.710 --> 12:30.830
It's about selling
a feeling.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.670
You have a voice
that's needed here.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.330
Tell your stories,
make it personal,

12:36.330 --> 12:39.040
because that is what people
will respond to.

12:40.710 --> 12:41.670
Curtis.

12:43.710 --> 12:44.920
What's true to you?

12:46.210 --> 12:49.420
Well, I didn't get my first pair
of fly kicks till I was 9.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.960
Mm.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.920
And I'll never forget
the sound of the paper crinkling

12:53.920 --> 12:55.250
when I pulled them
out the box.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.580
Bingo.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.880
I had these hot-pink high-tops
when I was little,

12:59.880 --> 13:01.960
and I used to wear them,
like, everywhere.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.420
It didn't take long

13:03.420 --> 13:06.710
for my mentees using
Dre's Protégés Program --

13:06.710 --> 13:07.920
patent pending --

13:07.920 --> 13:09.750
to make major strides.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.880
Josh may have warmed them up,

13:11.880 --> 13:14.790
but I was conditioning them
into all-stars.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.080
And after a few days,

13:16.080 --> 13:18.380
when the opportunity
presented itself,

13:18.380 --> 13:21.540
I decided to let them
do a trial pitch.

13:21.540 --> 13:24.500
So, if you're
a true sneaker-head like me,

13:24.500 --> 13:26.330
then you never forget
your first pair.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.290
Yes, and -- and growing up,
we were paycheck-to-paycheck.

13:29.290 --> 13:31.880
So when I cracked open
that box

13:31.880 --> 13:36.210
and I felt the paper crinkle
over a pair of new Air Max 90s,

13:36.210 --> 13:38.250
I felt like
anything was possible.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.080
Yeah, my dad got me
my first pair

13:40.080 --> 13:41.290
on my 3rd birthday.

13:41.290 --> 13:42.710
And I kept
tripping in them

13:42.710 --> 13:44.380
because they were
three sizes too big.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.880
But it was worth
chipping my baby teeth

13:47.880 --> 13:49.080
to look so fresh.

13:50.420 --> 13:52.960
And that right there
is our way in.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.920
"My First Kicks" --
the story of your first pair.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.080
Wow.
That is great.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.080
Hot, right?
Thank you.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.670
It is so exciting to hear
these fresh, young voices

14:05.670 --> 14:07.380
with their fingers
on the pulse.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.040
It's like
that first home.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.880
You know,
that's a landmark thing.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.250
Your first wife --
landmark thing. You know?

14:13.250 --> 14:17.040
Or the first time you realize
that you own 51% of the company

14:17.040 --> 14:19.420
and can fire
anyone in this room.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.790
And, uh, hey,
that's a landmark.

14:22.670 --> 14:25.460
To come up with something
this good at your level...
Yeah.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.170
...is very impressive.
It really is.

14:28.420 --> 14:29.920
But why don't you
come up with something

14:29.920 --> 14:31.330
like that, Dre?
Yeah, Dre.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.620
They keep coming up with
ideas like this,

14:32.620 --> 14:34.040
we're not gonna need you
around here anymore.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.710
Actually...

14:40.710 --> 14:43.040
...I didn't want to say this,
because I'm too classy,

14:43.040 --> 14:45.620
but...this is my idea.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.170
All right?
All of it.

14:47.170 --> 14:49.040
Every single piece of it.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.920
You know, from the shoes
to the personal touch,

14:50.920 --> 14:52.210
to the crinkling.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.960
Come on, man.
I buy tons of shoes.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.080
Don't nobody crinkle
like Dre.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.080
All right?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.960
This is Dre day all day!

14:57.960 --> 14:59.120
Now siéntate-say!

15:00.790 --> 15:02.330
Go on, sit down.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.460
All right?

15:03.460 --> 15:05.000
Well, Dre,
if that's the case, then...

15:05.000 --> 15:06.710
great work.
Thank you.

15:06.710 --> 15:09.210
Well, if you love that idea,
then you'll love mine.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.170
Your last
pair of shoes.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.040
The ones you die in.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.380
Everybody has a story
for that.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.290
Oh, no,
it went great.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.080
Hey.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.000
What was that
back there?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.250
Let me call you back.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.460
What are you
talking about?

15:26.460 --> 15:27.460
It went great.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.000
Yeah,
it was going great,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.380
until you totally took credit
for our ideas!

15:31.380 --> 15:33.000
Wha--
That wasn't cool!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.210
Zion wants
a piece of you.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.380
What is she mad at?

15:37.380 --> 15:40.000
We came up with this
as a team!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.960
I gave you
your way in.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.960
Before me,
you had nothing!

15:43.960 --> 15:46.960
Yeah, but those were our ideas
that they responded to.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.170
Then you swooped in
and stole our thunder.

15:49.170 --> 15:50.500
You made it
all about you.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.540
Yeah, man.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.710
Curtis crinkles!
Dre don't crinkle.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.330
Oh, I crinkle.
And I crunch.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.040
Man, I don't have to sit here
and take this mess.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.250
You know what?
This is my office. You leave.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.290
And lock the door
behind you.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.290
Go judge me
from someplace else.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.040
Dre, Dre, Dre.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.330
Is it true?

16:23.330 --> 16:24.710
Is what true?

16:24.710 --> 16:27.540
Your mentees are saying
that you stole their idea.

16:27.540 --> 16:29.920
It wasn't even
a real pitch, man.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.120
There's no client.
There's no money on the line.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.670
Congratulations, Dre.

16:34.670 --> 16:35.960
You won practice.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.500
I felt like I was being
shoved out of my lane.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.170
Wh-- You felt threatened
by them?

16:41.170 --> 16:43.420
You think that's why
we hired you?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.210
To be the voice
of young, urban identity?

16:46.460 --> 16:48.960
"Urban" is
in my title.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.920
I mean, yeah,
we did initially,

16:51.920 --> 16:54.580
but you're
45 years old now.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.620
If we want to know
what young people think,

16:56.620 --> 16:58.710
we'll go look
at an 8-year-old's Instagram.

16:58.710 --> 17:01.710
You're not just
"the Black guy."

17:01.710 --> 17:03.710
You've shown over the years
that you're more than that.

17:06.170 --> 17:07.290
I know.

17:08.830 --> 17:11.000
But when I came up,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.960
there was one Black executive
for the one Black spot,

17:13.960 --> 17:16.380
and there wasn't room
for someone else.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.750
Uh, see? That's what
they said about the NHL.

17:18.750 --> 17:21.000
And now we got
two whole brothers up in there.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Just take it easy.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.670
Sometimes our insecurities

17:24.670 --> 17:26.790
lead us all
to do some stupid things.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.000
You did this, too?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.830
To Black people?
Hell no!

17:29.830 --> 17:31.250
That's despicable.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.250
But I have dragged down

17:33.250 --> 17:35.830
every woman
I've ever worked with.

17:35.830 --> 17:36.790
Thanks, Daphne.

17:36.790 --> 17:37.790
"Daphne"?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.330
Wh-- What?

17:39.330 --> 17:41.290
You think just because
we had this sensitive moment

17:41.290 --> 17:42.880
that we're
on a first-name basis?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.380
No, I was --

17:44.380 --> 17:45.580
You better check yourself.

17:45.580 --> 17:47.040
I...I --

17:47.040 --> 17:48.790
Lost your damn mind.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.330
"Daphne."

17:50.330 --> 17:51.790
Hey.
Hey, Mom.

17:51.790 --> 17:53.250
Hi, sweetie.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.330
Oh...my God!

17:55.330 --> 17:56.830
What -- What --
What happened?!

17:56.830 --> 17:58.120
I got in a fight.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.620
Uh,
he lost the fight --

17:59.620 --> 18:01.380
to Mason.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.420
And, yes,
that Mason.
What?

18:03.420 --> 18:05.040
I had to do something.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.420
The boys
wouldn't stop talking

18:06.420 --> 18:08.080
about how you "brought
your milkshake to the yard."

18:08.080 --> 18:09.250
Oh, my God.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.880
And now I have to delete Kelis
off my phone.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.500
That song is ruined.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.830
Sweetheart,
can you give us a second?

18:15.830 --> 18:17.880
Can you sit down?
Are you okay?

18:17.880 --> 18:19.420
Yeah.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.290
Oh, my God, Jack.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.620
You know a fight is never
how you solve something.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.250
I just want things to go back
to the way they were.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.290
I know.

18:28.290 --> 18:30.120
Before the guys
got all into you,

18:30.120 --> 18:31.620
we --
we were just normal.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.080
We would just talk about
"Fortnite" and "Rick and Morty,"

18:34.080 --> 18:36.540
and -- and if we'd rather
get bit by a shark or a tiger.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.460
Tiger.

18:38.460 --> 18:39.960
I would -- I think ti--

18:39.960 --> 18:41.080
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.290
Now they're just
all weird.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.000
Look, I know this is
a weird time, Jack.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.330
But it's weird
for everybody.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.290
Do you know
that Grandma Ruby told me

18:49.290 --> 18:51.460
that when your dad
was in middle school,

18:51.460 --> 18:53.380
he had a crush
on the mail lady

18:53.380 --> 18:54.920
because she wore
knee socks?

18:54.920 --> 18:56.120
That's all it took?

18:56.120 --> 18:58.000
Yeah. Absolutely.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.670
What?

18:59.670 --> 19:00.920
But then it passed.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.920
And it's gonna pass with
your friends. It totally is.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.380
They're gonna start having
crushes on girls your age,

19:06.380 --> 19:09.380
or...your mom's
gonna turn 36.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.580
Thanks, Mom.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.420
You're welcome,
sweetheart.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.290
Boy, I'm not looking forward

19:15.290 --> 19:17.830
to going through this again
with Devante.

19:17.830 --> 19:19.420
I don't think you're gonna
have that problem, Mom.

19:19.420 --> 19:20.580
Mm.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.380
'Cause you're gonna be,
like, old.

19:23.880 --> 19:24.880
Like, super old.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.420
Jack.
Come on, Mom.

19:26.420 --> 19:28.000
Diane already told me
that you're 50.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.880
Ah!

19:32.880 --> 19:35.000
Look who it is.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.210
What did you come by
to take credit for this time?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.000
My outfit, perhaps?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.380
I bought you that.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.710
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

19:42.880 --> 19:46.120
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.830
And if it makes you
feel any better,

19:48.830 --> 19:52.290
I told Stevens that
those stories were 100% yours.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.540
Wow. You did?

19:54.540 --> 19:58.380
I was serious about
offering you real guidance here,

19:58.380 --> 20:01.040
because I want to do
what I can

20:01.040 --> 20:03.460
to set you up
for futures here.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.540
Look at it right now --
there's only a few of us.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.000
But if we do this right,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.120
it can be like Wakanda
up in this piece.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.880
All right,
so, when you're ready to --

20:12.880 --> 20:14.290
Oh, I'm ready!
I'm ready.

20:14.290 --> 20:16.080
I'm ready.
Okay. Okay.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.830
Look, I've been your assistant
for like five years now.

20:18.830 --> 20:20.330
I got a kid
looking at colleges.

20:20.330 --> 20:21.460
Damn.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.000
I think it's about time
I made some moves.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.420
Okay.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.420
All right,
Curtis with a "C."

20:27.880 --> 20:30.080
You know, I will make sure
that you get some real work

20:30.080 --> 20:31.790
on some other accounts.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.040
Okay?
I appreciate it.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.500
You got my word
on that.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.500
Thanks, Dad.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.330
Mm-hmm.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.960
Yeah.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.790
Thanks, Dre.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.290
Damn, she's strong.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.620
You sure you're okay
with me being here?

20:49.620 --> 20:51.040
Yeah. You're my mom.
I want you here.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.540
Okay.

20:52.540 --> 20:54.670
Oh. Also, thanks for dressing
as frumpy as possible.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.750
Oh, I --
I thought I looked nice.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.380
But...sure.

20:58.380 --> 21:01.210
Dude! You got to check out
Dane's mom. Whew!

21:01.210 --> 21:04.620
She's been taking some swings
since the divorce, and wow.

21:04.620 --> 21:05.830
Later, Mom.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.960
Oh. Sure.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.830
That's my baby.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.710
My disgusting baby.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.790
Okay. Okay. Okay.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.670
Okay, on the field.
On the field.

21:17.670 --> 21:18.710
Yeah.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.170
-Mom!
-Shhh! Daddy's working!
