WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.539
SORRY I HAVEN'T
BLOGGED IN A WHILE.

00:08.539 --> 00:11.112
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY PLAYING
THAT NEW VIDEO GAME

00:11.112 --> 00:12.683
"REALM OF THE TOWER."

00:12.683 --> 00:15.446
THAT'S ME!
I'M A FIRE ELF!

00:15.446 --> 00:19.690
VERY DIFFERENT
FROM A CHRISTMAS ELF--
I KILL STUFF!

00:19.690 --> 00:22.593
I'VE BEEN PLAYING ONLINE WITH
MY NEW BEST FRIEND KILGORE.

00:22.593 --> 00:25.696
IT'S SO COOL -- HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW I'M A DOG!

00:25.696 --> 00:27.528
HA HA HA! YEAH!

00:27.528 --> 00:30.701
ALL RIGHT, KILGORE,
LET'S WIN THIS BATTLE
AND GET OUT OF THE FOREST.

00:30.701 --> 00:32.803
ALL THESE TREES ARE
MAKING ME WANT TO PEE.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.735
UH, WHAT?
I MEAN,

00:34.735 --> 00:37.037
NOT LIKE A DOG, I MEAN,
I-I'M NOT A DOG.

00:37.037 --> 00:42.073
I'M A NORMAL PERSON...
WHO PEES ON TREES!

00:42.073 --> 00:44.545
STAN, TYLER IS
DRIVING ME CRAZY!

00:44.545 --> 00:47.078
HE KEEPS TAGGING
THE ART WALL IN MY ROOM!

00:47.078 --> 00:50.551
NO MATTER WHAT I DRAW,
HE ADDS A HANDLEBAR
MUSTACHE TO IT.

00:52.423 --> 00:55.055
HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:55.055 --> 00:57.688
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
I KNOW, RIGHT?

00:57.688 --> 01:00.591
I JUS WISH SOMEONE AROUND HERE
WOULD APPRECIATE ART.

01:00.591 --> 01:02.062
YOU'RE LOSING THE BATTLE!

01:02.062 --> 01:04.465
YOU'RE TELLING ME.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.667
THROW HIM INTO
THE FLAMING PIT OF RONDOR!

01:06.667 --> 01:10.201
HAVE YOU HEARD
A SINGLE WORD I'VE SAID?

01:10.201 --> 01:14.675
OF COURSE. THROW TYLER INTO
THE FLAMING PIT OF RONDOR.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.250
CAN'T FIND A FLAMING PIT,
JUST FILL HIS PILLOWCASE
WITH WHIPPED CREAM.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.613
WHIPPED CREAM IN THE PILLOWCASE.
THAT'S MESSY AND IMMATURE.

01:22.613 --> 01:24.385
I LOVE IT!

01:24.385 --> 01:26.687
STAN, ARE YOU STILL
PLAYING THAT GAME?

01:26.687 --> 01:28.389
YOU'VE BEEN GOING AT IT
FOR WEEKS NOW.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.621
HOLD ON A SEC,
KILGORE.

01:30.621 --> 01:34.665
FIRST OF ALL, CALL ME
BY MY AVATAR NAME--
"POODLE LOVER 152."

01:34.665 --> 01:39.870
I'M PRETTY SURE THE OTHER 151
DON'T LOVE POODLES
THE WAY I LOVE POODLES.

01:39.870 --> 01:43.434
SO, ARE THESE THE CREATURES
YOU GET TO FIGHT IN BATTLE?

01:43.434 --> 01:46.477
YEAH. I GET TO DROP CAVE TROLLS
AND ICE TROLLS

01:46.477 --> 01:49.340
AND THE SURPRISINGLY VICIOUS
OCTO-BUNNY.

01:49.340 --> 01:52.313
THE BEST PART IS,
MY BATTLE BUDDY KILGORE

01:52.313 --> 01:54.215
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I'M A DOG.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.217
HUH?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.419
UH, I THINK HE DOES NOW.

01:58.419 --> 02:01.652
I MEAN, A--
A DOG WITH THE LADIES.

02:01.652 --> 02:04.895
OWOOOO!

02:04.895 --> 02:06.727
( howling )

02:06.727 --> 02:08.729
♪♪

02:26.577 --> 02:28.779
I THINK WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

02:28.779 --> 02:30.881
IT'S TOO TIGHT.

02:30.881 --> 02:32.623
IT'S STRETCHING MY FACE.

02:32.623 --> 02:36.657
I LOOK LIKE AUNT MARY
AFTER HER VACATION.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.291
SWEETIE, YOU NEED TO LOOK GOOD
FOR YOUR SCHOOL PICTURE
ON THURSDAY.

02:40.291 --> 02:44.465
DON'T WANT ANOTHER DISASTER
LIKE LAST YEAR, DO WE?

02:44.465 --> 02:47.898
THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE
A PICTURE OF THE BACK
OF YOUR HEAD.

02:47.898 --> 02:50.471
DON'T YOU WANT TO HAVE
A NICE SCHOOL PICTURE,

02:50.471 --> 02:53.173
LIKE TYLER AND AVERY?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.246
TYLER!

02:55.246 --> 02:57.648
ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

02:59.310 --> 03:02.353
MOMMY, STOP.
MY HAIR DOESN'T LIKE THIS.

03:02.353 --> 03:04.585
WELL, WHEN YOU GET TO SCHOOL
ON PICTURE DAY,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.287
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TRY VERY HARD

03:06.287 --> 03:09.590
NOT TO LET THE RED MONSTER
TAKE OVER.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.562
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

03:11.562 --> 03:15.566
I TRIED TO TELL YOU--
THE HAIR WANTS WHAT IT WANTS.

03:16.927 --> 03:19.600
IF YOU WANT ME TO LOOK GOOD,
GET MY EARS PIERCED.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.602
YOUR EARS PIERCED?
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.734
MY FRIEND JULIE
GOT HER EARS PIERCED.

03:23.734 --> 03:26.677
JULIE'S PARENTS--
AND YOU CAN NEVER
SAY THIS TO ANYONE,

03:26.677 --> 03:29.610
IT'S OUR LITTLE SECRET--
ARE STUPID-HEADS.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.343
YOU'LL GET YOUR EARS PIERCED
WHEN YOU'RE TEN, LIKE AVERY DID.

03:32.343 --> 03:34.214
CAN'T WE JUST SAY I'M TEN?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.688
YOU TELL EVERYONE
YOU'RE THIRTY-TWO.

03:37.688 --> 03:40.421
NOW YOU CAN GET THEM PIERCED
WHEN YOU'RE TWELVE.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.222
OHHHH!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.955
STAN, IS DADDY
IN THE OFFICE?

03:44.955 --> 03:47.598
YEAH, I'M WAITING FOR HIM
TO GO OUT SO I CAN DROP A TROLL.

03:47.598 --> 03:51.762
DON'T WAIT TOO LONG--
YOU'LL GET A TUMMYACHE.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.736
DADDY, CAN I GET
MY EARS PIERCED?

03:55.736 --> 03:59.670
OH! MY LITTLE GIRL
IS GROWING UP.

03:59.670 --> 04:02.813
TODAY YOU WANT TO
GET YOUR EARS PIERCED,

04:02.813 --> 04:06.747
SOON YOU'RE GONNA BE TOO OLD
FOR A NECKIE-WECKIE.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.619
PHHFFFT!

04:08.619 --> 04:10.781
I'M ALREADY
TOO OLD FOR THAT.

04:10.781 --> 04:13.924
WOW. BEFORE LONG,
YOU'RE GONNA BE

04:13.924 --> 04:16.587
A NOTED
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
LIKE YOUR DADDY

04:16.587 --> 04:18.689
WITH A DIPLOMA LIKE THAT
ON YOUR WALL--

04:18.689 --> 04:20.961
TYLER!

04:20.961 --> 04:23.934
SO, CAN I GET
MY EARS PIERCED?

04:23.934 --> 04:25.766
OF COURSE,
PRINCESS.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.498
YAY! WHOO-HOO!

04:27.498 --> 04:28.999
OH, PRINCESS.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.571
KING.

04:31.642 --> 04:33.574
QUEEN.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.646
WAIT! CHLOES!

04:35.646 --> 04:37.648
HOLD ON, CHLOE.

04:37.648 --> 04:38.979
AH-AH-AH-AH.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.612
SWEETHEART,
BY ANY CHANCE

04:41.612 --> 04:44.585
DID YOU ASK MOMMY ABOUT
GETTING YOUR EARS PIERCED?

04:44.585 --> 04:47.518
YES.
AND WHAT DID MOMMY SAY?

04:47.518 --> 04:48.919
SHE SAID NO.

04:48.919 --> 04:52.763
CHLOE, I AM VERY
DISAPPOINTED.

04:52.763 --> 04:54.425
ME TOO!

04:54.425 --> 04:56.797
MOMMY'S BEING SO MEAN.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.900
NO, HONEY,
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.674
YOU CAN'T PLAY MOM AND ME
AGAINST EACH OTHER LIKE THAT.

05:03.674 --> 05:06.607
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.
WE SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.609
THEN HOW COME WE
ALWAYS DO WHAT MOMMY SAYS?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.542
BECAUSE THAT'S THE VOICE
WE SPEAK WITH.

05:11.542 --> 05:16.016
DOES THAT MEAN MOMMY'S
LIKE THE MAN IN THE FAMILY?

05:16.016 --> 05:19.049
NO, HONEY. YOUR MOM
IS ALL WOMAN.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.631
OOH! GREAT BATTLE, KILGORE!

05:30.631 --> 05:32.663
YEAH! AWESOME,
POODLE LOVER.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.805
HEY, I GOTTA GO
DO MY HOMEWORK.

05:34.805 --> 05:36.467
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

05:36.467 --> 05:38.939
WE HUMANS AND OUR
CRAZY AMOUNTS OF HOMEWORK

05:38.939 --> 05:41.972
AND OUR WALKING ON TWO LEGS--
WACKY STUFF!

05:44.645 --> 05:47.618
HEY, TALKING
TO KILGORE AGAIN?
YEAH,

05:47.618 --> 05:50.451
AND IT TURNS OUT
HE LIVES IN PASADENA, TOO.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.124
WE'RE MEETING AT THE PARK
FOR "THE REALM OF THE TOWER"
GAME-PLAYERS GATHERING.

05:54.124 --> 05:57.558
IT'S PART OF THEIR
"GET A LITTLE SUN" INITIATIVE.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.431
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
OVERLOOKING SOMETHING?

06:00.431 --> 06:03.694
NO. THERE'LL BE
UMBRELLA HATS FOR
THE REALLY PALE KIDS.

06:03.694 --> 06:06.597
WHAT ABOUT FOR
THE TALKING DOGS?

06:06.597 --> 06:09.670
OH, MAN! I DIDN'T
EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT!

06:09.670 --> 06:13.744
AND I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING TO MEET KILGORE
PROPERLY, YA KNOW?

06:13.744 --> 06:16.807
LICK HIS FACE,
SNIFF HIS BUTT...

06:16.807 --> 06:18.709
HEY! I COULD GO WITH YOU!

06:18.709 --> 06:21.652
YOU WANT TO LICK HIS FACE
AND SNIFF HIS BUTT?

06:21.652 --> 06:24.885
NO, NO. I MEAN, I'LL PRETEND
LIKE I'M THE ONE

06:24.885 --> 06:26.757
WHO'S BEEN PLAYING THE GAME
AS "POODLE LOVER."

06:26.757 --> 06:29.820
MOM CAN TAKE US TO THE PARK,
YOU CAN COME WITH ME AS MY DOG

06:29.820 --> 06:31.722
AND MEET HIM
IN THE REAL WORLD,
LIKE YOU WANT.

06:31.722 --> 06:34.725
BUT HOW CAN YOU BE ME?
WHEN I PLAY, I HAVE
THE VOICE OF

06:34.725 --> 06:37.167
(lowers voice)
A BRAWNY, MACHO BARBARIAN--

06:37.167 --> 06:39.730
AS THE NAME "POODLE LOVER"
IMPLIES.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.732
UH...OOH!

06:41.732 --> 06:43.774
WHAT IF I SAY THAT
I USE A VOICE MODIFIER

06:43.774 --> 06:46.437
SO THE BOYS AREN'T EMBARRASSED
WHEN THEY LOSE TO A GIRL?

06:46.437 --> 06:50.040
WELL, THE FEMINIST AGENDA
IS A BIT GRATUITOUS, BUT OKAY.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.143
HOW WILL YOU KNOW
WHAT TO SAY?

06:53.143 --> 06:56.086
YOU'LL TELL ME.
IT'LL BE LIKE YOU'RE
LIVING THROUGH ME.

06:56.086 --> 06:59.620
I'LL BE...YOUR
REAL-WORLD AVATAR.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.724
YES! IF YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE WORLD THROUGH MY EYES,
YOU GOTTA LIVE LIKE A DOG--

07:03.724 --> 07:06.697
EAT, SLEEP AND BREATHE
LIKE A DOG.

07:06.697 --> 07:08.559
YOU GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO,
OKAY?

07:08.559 --> 07:10.701
LESSON ONE:
GET OFF THE COUCH!

07:10.701 --> 07:13.864
PERFECT. YOU'RE READY.

07:13.864 --> 07:16.867
Chloe (chanting):
I WANT MY EARS PIERCED!

07:16.867 --> 07:20.170
I WANT MY EARS PIERCED!
I WANT MY EARS PIERCED!

07:20.170 --> 07:21.772
I WANT MY EARS PIERCED--

07:21.772 --> 07:24.444
CHLOE! A TANTRUM
IS NOT GOING TO WORK!

07:24.444 --> 07:26.947
THAT'S HOW YOU
GOT EARRINGS.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.750
YOU ARE NOT GETTING
YOUR EARS PIERCED.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.753
DADDY AND I MADE UP OUR MINDS,
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ACCEPT IT.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.556
I WANT MY EARS PIERCED!

07:35.556 --> 07:37.588
I WANT MY EARS PIERCED...

07:37.588 --> 07:39.089
NOT SO FAST!

07:40.831 --> 07:42.763
BENNETT, SHE'S
THROWING A TANTRUM.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.495
WELL, THAT'S HOW
YOU GOT EARRINGS.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.539
YOU'RE THE CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST--
DO SOMETHING.

07:48.539 --> 07:50.470
WELL, I COULD REFER HER
TO MY ARTICLE

07:50.470 --> 07:53.774
"FROM PIERCED EARS
TO LIP PLATES:
A SLIPPERY SLOPE."

07:54.875 --> 07:56.547
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

07:56.547 --> 07:59.650
I WANT MY EARS
PIERCED!...
CHLOE, COME HERE.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.051
SHH! LISTEN.

08:01.051 --> 08:04.515
IT IS TIME FOR
THE LIPPER ZIPPER.

08:04.515 --> 08:06.987
NOW, YOU WANT
TO UNZIP YOUR LIPS,

08:06.987 --> 08:09.920
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET THE KEY!

08:09.920 --> 08:11.522
THAT'S VERY SMART.

08:11.522 --> 08:14.525
SMARTER THAN YOU THINK--
I STILL GOT THE KEY.

08:14.525 --> 08:16.927
WELL, AT LEAST
I BOUGHT US SOME TIME.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.829
YEAH, BUT SHE'S NOT
GONNA LET THIS GO.

08:18.829 --> 08:22.272
WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING
TO DISTRACT HER SO
SHE'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT IT.

08:22.272 --> 08:26.176
I'D DO IT, BUT I PROMISED AVERY
I'D TAKE HER TO SOME VIDEO GAME
THING IN THE PARK.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.739
I CAN'T TAKE CHLOE.
I HAVE PATIENTS.

08:28.739 --> 08:30.581
WELL, I HAVE RUN OUT
OF PATIENCE,

08:30.581 --> 08:32.913
TO THE POINT WHERE
I CAN'T EVEN ENJOY
THAT CLEVER WORDPLAY

08:32.913 --> 08:34.585
ENOUGH TO SAY,
"GOOD ONE, ELLEN."

08:34.585 --> 08:35.886
GOOD ONE, ELLEN.

08:35.886 --> 08:38.819
SOMEONE IS GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP CHLOE ENTERTAINED
THIS AFTERNOON.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.921
NOT SO FAST!

08:40.921 --> 08:42.553
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.899
MOM AND DAD SAID I HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

08:48.899 --> 08:51.001
HMMMMM! UMM-MMM!

08:55.866 --> 08:58.308
OH. I WANT TO
GET MY EARS PIERCED.

08:58.308 --> 09:00.871
DID YOU ASK MOM AND DAD?
YES.

09:00.871 --> 09:02.873
COOL! LET'S GO.

09:12.923 --> 09:16.126
WOW! IT'S GREAT TO SEE KIDS
GETTING OFF THE COMPUTER
AND OUT OF THE HOUSE...

09:16.126 --> 09:19.660
TO GET RIGHT BACK
ON THE COMPUTER AGAIN.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.832
HEY! I THINK THAT'S
THE FRIEND I'M MEETING.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.964
HOW DO
YOU KNOW?
THAT'S MY
AVATAR NAME.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.696
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU LIKED POODLES.

09:25.696 --> 09:27.598
APPARENTLY YOU HAVEN'T
READY MY DIARY.

09:27.598 --> 09:29.840
NO, I HAVE. THERE'S
NOTHING IN THERE--
AHA!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.702
HMM. ALL RIGHT,
IF YOU NEED ME,

09:31.702 --> 09:33.874
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER THERE WHERE
I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.946
OOH. JUST STAY AWAY
FROM THAT KID.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.748
OH, SHE'S NOT
PART OF THE GAME.

09:37.748 --> 09:39.249
THAT'S "ANGRY TINA."
SHE'S REALLY NICE.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.153
"FRIENDLY TEDDY"
HAD IT COMING.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.916
DON'T LET THE NAME
FOOL YOU.

09:45.916 --> 09:49.189
LET'S MEET KILGORE!
LET'S MEET KILGORE!

09:49.189 --> 09:51.862
(sobbing)
LET'S MEET KILGORE!!!

09:51.862 --> 09:54.164
ALL RIGHT,
BUT WE GOTTA
PLAY IT COOL.

09:54.164 --> 09:56.366
I'M COOL, BABY.

09:56.366 --> 09:58.899
OKAY. I'VE GOT
THE EAR PIECE IN.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.871
Stan (over transmitter):
IS THIS COSTUME HIDING
MY MOUTH AND HEADSET?

10:00.871 --> 10:04.004
YEAH, IT LOOKS GOOD.
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT COSTUME, ANYWAY?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.777
I MADE IT WITH SOME MATERIAL
I FOUND AROUND THE HOUSE.

10:06.777 --> 10:09.239
I'M OFF TO MY
SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT.

10:09.239 --> 10:11.611
SHOW 'EM WHAT YOU GOT.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.046
COME ON, LET'S GO.

10:16.046 --> 10:19.319
UM, EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU KILGORE?
YEAH.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.152
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M POODLE LOVER 152.

10:22.152 --> 10:26.026
OH! YOU'RE A GIRL!
SEE, NOW THAT NAME
MAKES SENSE.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.258
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

10:28.258 --> 10:31.261
BUT ONLINE,
YOUR VOICE SOUNDS LIKE...

10:31.261 --> 10:33.804
A BRAWNY, MACHO
BARBARIAN?

10:33.804 --> 10:35.836
THAT'S THE SETTING I USE
ON MY VOICE MODIFIER.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.810
I COULDN'T CHOOSE BETWEEN THAT
AND AN AMAZON WARRIOR PRINCESS.

10:39.810 --> 10:42.773
AY-YI-YI-YI-YI-
YI-YI-YI-YI-YI!

10:42.773 --> 10:44.074
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

10:44.074 --> 10:46.717
SO, IS IT A PROBLEM
THAT I'M A GIRL?

10:46.717 --> 10:50.080
UH, NO. ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF COOL.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.024
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOIN' IN
FOR A SNIFF.

10:54.024 --> 10:55.285
( sniffing )

10:55.285 --> 10:58.188
WHOA!
C-CONTROL YOUR DOG!

10:58.188 --> 11:00.660
I'M SORRY, HE'S JUST
TRYING TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.262
I DIDN'T GET
A GOOD WHIFF!

11:02.262 --> 11:05.265
YOU'RE SCARING HIM AWAY.
JUST STAND TO THE SIDE
AND FEED ME YOUR QUESTIONS.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.938
FINE, JUST DO ME A SOLID
AND SNIFF HIS BUTT.

11:07.938 --> 11:09.900
I GOTS TO KNOW!

11:11.101 --> 11:14.104
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE
WITH YOUR FREE SAMPLES,

11:14.104 --> 11:15.846
BUT I'M A SAVVY CONSUMER.

11:15.846 --> 11:18.008
YOU'RE NOT JUST GONNA
HOOK ME ON YOUR PRODUCT

11:18.008 --> 11:20.310
AND GET ME TO BUY
SOMETHING I DON'T NEED.

11:20.310 --> 11:23.353
I WILL, HOWEVER,
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
YOUR OFFER FOR A TASTE.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.457
WOW! OH, MY--!

11:32.092 --> 11:35.025
THAT'S GOOD, THANKS.
I'LL TAKE THIS TOO.

11:37.327 --> 11:40.300
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE WERE AMBUSHED BY
THE DREAM WINJIN GUILD

11:40.300 --> 11:42.402
AND THEY STOLE OUR
RING OF DESHERMANE?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.304
OH, YEAH,
THAT WAS SO DEPRESSING.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.208
NO! THE RING
WAS A BOOBY TRAP.
IT WAS AWESOME!

11:48.208 --> 11:51.711
AND BY "DEPRESSING,"
I MEAN "AWESOME"!

11:51.711 --> 11:53.313
THAT'S HOW WE SAY IT
AT MY SCHOOL.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.115
DEPRESSING!

11:55.115 --> 11:56.787
WELL, THAT'S COOL.

11:56.787 --> 12:00.150
SO, BESIDES
REALM OF THE TOWER,
WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO?

12:00.150 --> 12:03.023
I LIKE TO CHASE CARS
AND DRINK OUT OF THE TOILET.

12:03.023 --> 12:07.097
UH, I LIKE CAR CHASES
AND USING INDOOR PLUMBING.

12:07.097 --> 12:08.128
( laughs )

12:08.128 --> 12:10.000
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.933
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.966
YOU'RE REALLY...
DEPRESSING!

12:15.966 --> 12:19.009
YEAH, YOU TOO. I MEAN,
LIKE, TOTALLY MOROSE!

12:19.009 --> 12:20.811
HEY, GUYS, HOW'S IT GOIN',
HAVE YOU TRIED THIS JUICE,

12:20.811 --> 12:22.212
I'VE HAD LIKE TEN OF 'EM,
THEY'RE GREAT!!!

12:22.212 --> 12:25.245
WOW! THERE'S A BIRD! OKAY, KIDS,
HAVE FUN NOW, BYE!

12:25.245 --> 12:26.777
SORRY,
THAT WAS MY MOM.

12:26.777 --> 12:29.950
DOES SHE KNOW HOW MUCH SUGAR
IS IN THOSE DRINKS?

12:29.950 --> 12:33.984
MAYBE SHE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
WHEN THAT TAI-CHI CLASS
CHASES HER OFF.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.330
WOW, THIS IS MAKING ME THIRSTY!
I GOTTA GO GET SOME MORE JUICE!

12:40.330 --> 12:45.335
OKAY, NOW ASK KILGORE
WHAT HIS FAVORITE
LEFTOVER MEAT IS.

12:45.335 --> 12:48.238
SO, UH, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
SUBJECT IN SCHOOL?

12:48.238 --> 12:51.271
"MEAT." THE CATEGORY
WAS "LEFTOVER MEAT."

12:51.271 --> 12:53.273
I LOVE ART.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.045
I LOVE ART!

12:55.045 --> 12:57.447
"ART" BETTER BE THE NAME
OF THE COW YOU JUST BUTCHERED,

12:57.447 --> 12:59.549
BECAUSE THE SUBJECT IS MEAT!

12:59.549 --> 13:01.551
I HAVE AN ART WALL
IN MY ROOM

13:01.551 --> 13:03.013
THAT I DRAW ON
ALL THE TIME!

13:03.013 --> 13:05.015
THAT IS SO COOL!

13:05.015 --> 13:08.889
HEY! AVERY-TAR!
DON'T GO ROGUE ON ME.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.192
ASK HIM IF HE CAN
THROW A BALL. MOST
OF THESE KIDS CAN'T.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.165
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

13:15.165 --> 13:17.327
YOU'RE NOT WHAT
I WAS EXPECTING, EITHER.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.870
BY THE WAY, MY NAME'S KEVIN.

13:19.870 --> 13:21.331
OH. MY NAME IS STAN.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.173
MY NAME'S AVERY.
THAT'S IT!

13:23.173 --> 13:24.935
YOU ARE THE WORST AVATAR EVER!

13:24.935 --> 13:27.177
( barking )

13:27.177 --> 13:29.139
( growling )
OH! I-I'M SORRY.

13:29.139 --> 13:32.082
MY DOG CAN BE
A REAL PAIN THE BUTT!

13:32.082 --> 13:34.084
( barking )
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING,

13:34.084 --> 13:35.385
BUT IT WAS REALLY
NICE MEETING YOU.

13:35.385 --> 13:38.919
YEAH. YOU TOO.
MAYBE WE'LL PLAY
ONLINE LATER?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.951
YEAH, THAT'D BE
DEPRESSING!

13:42.122 --> 13:44.254
I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.356
I'M NOT TALKING

END OF THE GAMER JUICE RAINBOW

14:25.035 --> 14:28.168

IT'S TAKEN US THREE MONTHS,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.687
BUT WE'VE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL BATTLE.

15:17.687 --> 15:18.918
ROGER THAT, AVERY.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
DON'T CALL ME
THAT GIRLY NAME!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.553
(lowers voice)
IT'S "POODLE LOVER."

15:23.553 --> 15:25.355
OH, HEY,
IS THAT KEVIN?

15:25.355 --> 15:27.027
I WANT TO ASK IF HE
WANTS TO GO TO THE MALL

15:27.027 --> 15:29.559
AND FLY THOSE
LITTLE HELICOPTERS
INTO THE HAIR SALON.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.602
BACK OFF. HE'S BUSY
PLAYING WITH HIS REAL FRIEND.

15:32.602 --> 15:34.634
I KNOW. I'LL BE HIS
FRIEND IN THE REAL WORLD,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.636
YOU'LL BE HIS FRIEND
IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.668
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY FRIEND
IN BOTH WORLDS,

15:38.668 --> 15:40.370
AND NOW HE CALLS ME "AVERY."

15:40.370 --> 15:42.372
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

15:42.372 --> 15:43.613
HEY, KEVIN!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

15:43.613 --> 15:46.076
THE BATTLE'S BEGUN!
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

15:46.076 --> 15:49.679
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR
VOICE MODIFIER, POODLE LOVER?

15:49.679 --> 15:52.182
Avery: I TURNED IT OFF.
Stan: BUT IT'S BACK ON NOW.

15:52.182 --> 15:54.584
NOW IT'S BROKEN!
FIXED IT!

15:54.584 --> 15:57.357
QUIT MESSIN' AROUND!
WE'RE GETTING ANNIHILATED!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.690
GREAT. WE LOST.

16:00.690 --> 16:04.334
WHAT?!
NOW I HAVE TO START
THE LEVEL ALL OVER!

16:04.334 --> 16:06.966
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR PLAYING
WITH A STUPID GIRL!

16:06.966 --> 16:10.040
YOU'RE WEIRDER
THAN YOUR MOTHER!

16:10.040 --> 16:12.072
(battle sounds)
OH, NO!

16:12.072 --> 16:15.445
KILGORE JUST KILLED ME
AND STOLE ALL MY WEAPONS
AND SPELLS!

16:15.445 --> 16:18.078
AND JUST CALLED ME
AS WEIRD AS MY MOTHER.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.750
OF ALL THE HURTFUL THINGS
HE COULD HAVE SAID!

16:20.750 --> 16:23.383
AND MY MULE!
I HAD A FLYING MULE!

16:23.383 --> 16:26.586
SURE, HE WAS STUBBORN,
BUT HE COULD GO ANYWHERE!

16:26.586 --> 16:28.418
CAN'T YOU JUST
GET MORE STUFF?

16:28.418 --> 16:31.661
IT TOOK ME THREE MONTHS
TO COLLECT ALL THIS STUFF!

16:31.661 --> 16:34.724
I THOUGHT KILGORE WAS MY FRIEND,
AND HE BETRAYED ME.

16:34.724 --> 16:38.098
NONE OF THIS WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HAD
JUST STAYED OUT OF IT!

16:38.098 --> 16:40.130
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

16:44.104 --> 16:46.706
COULD YOU PLEASE
OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.080
LEAVE ME ALONE!|

16:50.080 --> 16:52.582
NO! WE HAVE TO GET
THOSE EARRINGS OUT, OKAY?

16:52.582 --> 16:54.144
YOUR PICTURES
ARE TODAY.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.586
IF YOU TAKE THEM OUT,
MY NEW HOLES WILL CLOSE.

16:56.586 --> 16:59.649
IF WE LEAVE THEM IN,
MOM AND DAD WILL PUT
NEW HOLES IN ME.

16:59.649 --> 17:02.021
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
THEY SAID NO.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.753
YOU NEVER ASKED.

17:03.753 --> 17:05.695
STOP SAYING SOMETHING
I WOULD SAY!

17:05.695 --> 17:07.497
NOW GIVE ME
THOSE EARRINGS!

17:07.497 --> 17:09.229
TYLER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH CHLOE?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.362
UH, JUST HELPING HER GET READY
FOR HER SCHOOL PICTURES,

17:12.362 --> 17:15.034
MAKING SURE WE HIDE
THOSE HIDEOUS EARS.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.037
WHAT? HER EARS
ARE ADORABLE!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.770
ADORABLE?!
SHE'S GOT THE EARS
OF A FRUIT BAT!

17:20.770 --> 17:22.572
HEY, I HEARD THAT.

17:22.572 --> 17:23.773
OF COURSE YOU DID.

17:23.773 --> 17:25.675
EEE! EEE! EEE! EEE!

17:25.675 --> 17:29.419
CHLOE, COME ON,
LET'S GET THAT HAIR
PULLED BACK OFF YOUR FACE.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.721
NO! I THINK
SHE LOOKS MUCH BETTER

17:31.721 --> 17:33.753
WITH HER LOOSE
AND FLOWING.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.825
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
LOOSE AND FLOWING IS IN.

17:35.825 --> 17:37.457
I WANT TO SEE HER FACE.
FACES ARE OUT!

17:37.457 --> 17:38.628
GIVE ME HER HAIR!
NO!

17:38.628 --> 17:39.789
I'M HER MOTHER!
LOOK!

17:39.789 --> 17:41.691
OH, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE!

17:41.691 --> 17:44.234
WHAT IS GOING ON?

17:44.234 --> 17:46.836
HER TINY BAT HEAD
NEEDS WARMTH.

17:46.836 --> 17:50.570
I WANT PEOPLE
TO SEE MY EARRINGS.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.606
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THIS HAPPENED?

17:56.606 --> 17:58.748
YOU NEVER ASKED?

18:03.713 --> 18:05.215
YOU'RE NOT
PLAYING YOUR GAME?

18:05.215 --> 18:07.086
WHAT'S THE POINT?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.320
LOOK, STAN,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.692
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
HOW MUCH KEVIN MEANT TO YOU.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.266
"KILGORE."
RIGHT.

18:16.266 --> 18:19.469
LOOK, YOU KNEW HIM FIRST,
AND I SHOULD HAVE
RESPECTED THAT.

18:19.469 --> 18:22.432
I JUST THOUGHT THAT FINALLY
I HAD A REAL FRIEND.

18:22.432 --> 18:24.734
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:24.734 --> 18:26.476
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

18:26.476 --> 18:29.309
I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT ME,
BUT IT'S JUST DIFFERENT.

18:29.309 --> 18:33.313
I'M YOUR DOG. I HAD A CHANCE AT
A REAL FRIENDSHIP WITH KILGORE

18:33.313 --> 18:35.415
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS A DOG.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.518
BUT I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE A DOG.

18:38.518 --> 18:42.492
WE'D BE FRIENDS
IF YOU WERE A DOG
OR A PERSON OR A CAT.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.197
I CARE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE,
NOT WHAT YOU ARE.

18:47.197 --> 18:49.229
REALLY?
YEAH.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.831
NOW, STAN,
I'VE TOLD YOU THINGS

18:51.831 --> 18:53.863
I'VE NEVER
TOLD ANYONE ELSE...

18:53.863 --> 18:55.865
YOU MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
WHEN I'M SAD...

18:55.865 --> 18:58.768
YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND
I'VE EVER HAD.

18:58.768 --> 19:00.540
YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND
I'VE EVER HAD.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.344
I GOT SO CAUGHT UP,
I JUST FORGOT THAT.
I'M SORRY.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.915
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS,

19:05.915 --> 19:08.578
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
YOU ALWAYS STAY FRIENDS.

19:08.578 --> 19:11.150
I LOVE YOU, AVERY.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.252
I LOVE YOU TOO, STAN.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.327
DID YOU JUST CALL ME A CAT
A MINUTE AGO?

19:17.327 --> 19:19.929
HEY, YOU KNOW,
KILGORE WAS NEVER
A REAL FRIEND, ANYWAYS.

19:19.929 --> 19:22.161
FRIENDS DON'T STAB
OTHER FRIENDS IN THE BACK.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.934
HE ACTUALLY
CLEAVED ME DOWN THE MIDDLE
WITH A BROADSWORD,

19:24.934 --> 19:26.796
NOT TO SPLIT HAIRS.

19:26.796 --> 19:29.339
WHICH HE ALSO DID.

19:29.339 --> 19:30.800
WELL, THEN...

19:30.800 --> 19:33.743
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
FOR US TO DO.

19:33.743 --> 19:35.545
OKAY, AVERY,
IT WONT BE EASY

19:35.545 --> 19:37.407
TAKING KILGORE DOWN
IN HIS LAIR.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.909
WE HAVE TO MOUNT A PERFECTLY
COORDINATED ATTACK.

19:39.909 --> 19:42.482
FOLLOW VERY CAREFULLY
IN MY FOOTSTEPS

19:42.482 --> 19:43.883
AND DO EXACTLY--
ALL RIGHT, TIME'S UP.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.515
LET'S DO THIS!

19:45.515 --> 19:48.488
AVERY JENNINGS!!!

19:48.488 --> 19:49.919
OH, MY GOD,
SHE JUST RAN IN!

19:49.919 --> 19:51.821
STICK TO THE PLAN!
USE YOUR SOUL STONE!

19:51.821 --> 19:53.423
WHAT'S A SOUL STONE?!

19:53.423 --> 19:54.824
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:54.824 --> 19:56.466
KNOCK IT OFF!

19:56.466 --> 19:58.868
Stan: HEY, KILGORE,
SAY HELLO TO MY REAL FRIEND--

19:58.868 --> 20:01.501
HER NAME IS AVERY,
AND SHE'S GOT A BATTLE AX
TO GRIND!

20:01.501 --> 20:02.832
YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT, KEVIN!

20:02.832 --> 20:05.875
HOW DOES IT FEEL
LOSING TO A GIRL?

20:05.875 --> 20:07.907
NOT THAT--
DON'T DO THAT!
DON'T DO THAT!

20:07.907 --> 20:09.839
NO!!!!

20:09.839 --> 20:11.981
HOLY COW!
YOU BEAT HIM!

20:11.981 --> 20:14.744
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I DID!

20:17.347 --> 20:18.818
WHOO!

20:18.818 --> 20:21.721
Stan:
SO AFTER A SWIFT
YET FIERCE BATTLE,

20:21.721 --> 20:25.224
POODLE LOVER 152
AND "STAN ROCKS"--

20:25.224 --> 20:26.796
THAT'S WHAT SHE GETS
FOR SAYING,

20:26.796 --> 20:28.898
"YOU PICK MY NAME,
I DON'T CARE" --

20:28.898 --> 20:31.461
CELEBRATED THEIR
GLORIOUS TRIUMPH.

20:33.603 --> 20:34.964
IT'S KINDA COOL--

20:34.964 --> 20:37.607
WE REALIZED WE WERE
CLOSER THAN WE THOUGHT,

20:37.607 --> 20:40.670
AND THEN WE GET EVEN CLOSER
THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.273
AND SOMETHING ELSE KIND OF COOL
CAME OUT OF THIS--

20:43.273 --> 20:45.445
I DISCOVERED GAMER JUICE.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.647
THIS STUFF IS GREAT!

20:47.647 --> 20:49.349
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I EVER LIVED WITHOUT IT!

20:49.349 --> 20:51.481
I BEEN CHASING STUFF
ALL DAY!

20:56.986 --> 20:58.588
Chloe:
I WANT TO WATCH TV!

20:58.588 --> 21:01.961
I WANT TO WATCH TV!
I WANT TO WATCH TV!!!

21:01.961 --> 21:04.294
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
OH, BOY.

21:04.294 --> 21:07.367
I KNOW WE HAD TO PUNISH HER
FOR THE EARRING THING,

21:07.367 --> 21:08.998
BUT DID WE HAVE TO
TAKE AWAY TV?

21:08.998 --> 21:10.670
FEEL LIKE WE'RE THE ONES
BEING PUNISHED.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.602
LOOK, I WISH WE'D COME UP
WITH SOMETHING CLEVER

21:12.602 --> 21:15.545
LIKE WE DID TO PUNISH TYLER
FOR ALL THAT MUSTACHE NONSENSE.

21:15.545 --> 21:17.507
Tyler:
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

21:17.507 --> 21:21.280
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL. BYE.
MORNING, TYLER. SLEEP WELL?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.684
YEAH. AND THANKS FOR
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WHOLE
EARRING THING WASN'T MY FAULT.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.657
WE'D NEVER PUNISH YOU
FOR SOMETHING THAT
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.789
I'M RUNNING LATE.
I GOTTA GO.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.923
I'M WALKING THAT CUTE
NEW GIRL TO SCHOOL.

21:33.923 --> 21:35.595
OKAY, HAVE A GOOD DAY.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.797
REMEMBER, IF SHE DOESN'T
HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR,

21:37.797 --> 21:40.029
SHE'S NOT FOR YOU.
WHAT?

21:40.029 --> 21:42.031
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER...

21:42.031 --> 21:44.303
BY ABOUT AN HOUR.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.875
DID WE GO TOO FAR?

21:45.875 --> 21:47.877
IT WAS A LITTLE
UNORTHODOX PARENTING,

21:47.877 --> 21:49.038
BUT I THINK IT WAS WARRANTED.

21:49.038 --> 21:51.511
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU USED PERMANENT MARKER.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.712
OH, I DID.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.983
GOOD ONE, ELLEN.

21:56.085 --> 21:59.018
I WANT A MUSTACHE!
I WANT A MUSTACHE!

21:59.018 --> 22:01.090
I WANT A MUSTACHE!!!

22:01.090 --> 22:02.792
OHH...
GRANT ME THE STRENGTH...

22:04.494 --> 22:06.526
I WANT A MUSTACHE!
