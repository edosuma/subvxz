00:00.039 --> 00:02.281
LAINEY: <i>Back in the '90s, our
clothes were what defined us,</i>

00:02.351 --> 00:04.070
<i>but like most schools,
we had a dress code</i>

00:04.109 --> 00:05.750
<i>the kids were always violating,</i>

00:05.812 --> 00:07.640
<i>like wearing jeans that have been ripped</i>

00:07.711 --> 00:09.377
<i>or straps that were spaghetti</i>

00:09.430 --> 00:10.858
<i>or even tops that had been tubed.</i>

00:10.952 --> 00:12.882
<i>But there was no bigger
dress-code offender</i>

00:12.964 --> 00:14.382
<i>than the funny off-color T-shirts.</i>

00:14.484 --> 00:15.650
Hey!

00:15.719 --> 00:18.349
Co-Ed Naked Baseball?
Is that some kind of joke?

00:18.435 --> 00:20.154
- Yeah, it's funny, right?
- Not to me.

00:20.223 --> 00:21.956
The lascivious implication is an affront

00:22.025 --> 00:23.925
to co-ed sports everywhere.

00:24.027 --> 00:25.727
And you! Get over here!

00:25.796 --> 00:28.494
How dare you promote the sport
of co-ed naked soccer?

00:28.533 --> 00:29.699
Lighten up, Coach.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.200
They sell these at Banana Republic.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.534
Oh, I got mine at Structure.

00:32.604 --> 00:33.770
It's like The Gap, but cooler,

00:33.838 --> 00:35.305
because they got Greco-Roman pillars.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.923
It's a blatant violation
of the school's dress code,

00:37.986 --> 00:39.342
and you know what that means.

00:39.411 --> 00:41.177
Sweet God, no, please. Not the bin.

00:41.246 --> 00:43.146
Oh, yes. The bin.

00:43.214 --> 00:44.814
Hey. You know the rules.

00:44.883 --> 00:47.250
Every student at this school
is required to dress...

00:47.319 --> 00:49.085
BOTH: Neat, clean, and appropriate.

00:49.154 --> 00:50.219
And an untucked T-shirt

00:50.289 --> 00:52.554
glorifying a butt-naked
sporting event is...

00:52.623 --> 00:54.790
BOTH: Neither neat nor clean
nor appropriate.

00:54.892 --> 00:56.425
Very good. Now get out.

00:56.494 --> 00:57.859
<i>Yep, Glascott was on a mission</i>

00:57.895 --> 00:59.861
<i>to make sure every student
followed the rules.</i>

00:59.930 --> 01:03.064
Uh, excuse me. That skirt is in
clear violation of the dress co...

01:03.133 --> 01:05.167
Oh. You're not a student.
You're a Lainey.

01:05.235 --> 01:06.168
[Chuckles] Thank you?

01:06.236 --> 01:07.536
Come on, the dress code clearly states

01:07.638 --> 01:09.371
that no skirt should be shorter
than your fingertips

01:09.440 --> 01:10.739
when your arms are down by your sides.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.175
I know that, and I'm good. See?

01:13.277 --> 01:14.310
All the way down.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.378
This is where they naturally
land. I'm sorry.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.481
I want your arms down by your
sides like a sloth, right now.

01:19.583 --> 01:20.876
I want sloth arms.

01:20.939 --> 01:22.493
And... violation.

01:22.548 --> 01:24.782
The dress code shouldn't even
apply to me, John. I'm a teacher.

01:24.855 --> 01:27.423
Exactly. If anyone should obey
the rules, it's you.

01:27.491 --> 01:29.891
I'm sorry, but we got to
take a trip to the bin.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.959
Listen to me.

01:31.028 --> 01:32.327
I will never,<i> ever</i> wear

01:32.395 --> 01:33.894
a dank, oversized shirt from the bin,

01:33.963 --> 01:35.363
so help me God.

01:36.333 --> 01:39.133
♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪

01:39.235 --> 01:42.102
♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪

01:42.205 --> 01:45.072

01:48.978 --> 01:51.312
<i>It was January 22nd, 1990-something,</i>

01:51.414 --> 01:53.348
<i>and Coach Mellor and
his girlfriend, Nurse Julie,</i>

01:53.450 --> 01:54.782
<i>were enjoying their morning ritual.</i>

01:54.884 --> 01:57.288
One cup of "Good Morning
America" for my lady.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.086
Two lumps of sugar and a dash of milk,

01:59.188 --> 02:00.888
just like the good Lord intended.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.357
What would I do without you, Rick?

02:02.459 --> 02:05.125
You would eat a lot less
root vegetables, Nurse Julie.

02:05.228 --> 02:06.093
Aww.

02:06.195 --> 02:07.628
- You guys are weird.
- But professional!

02:07.731 --> 02:09.896
You see, normally, I would
give her a kiss goodbye,

02:09.999 --> 02:11.766
but this is a place of business,

02:11.868 --> 02:13.133
so I'm going to send her off

02:13.236 --> 02:15.435
with an appropriate farewell canoodle.

02:15.537 --> 02:16.370
Mm!

02:16.472 --> 02:17.905
- Mm.
- Mm. [Giggles]

02:18.007 --> 02:19.340
For the record,

02:19.441 --> 02:22.109
canoodling is a thousand times
more disturbing than a kiss.

02:22.211 --> 02:24.144
Not for the canoodl-ees, Ms. Howell.

02:24.247 --> 02:26.513
There truly is no feeling
like mashing faces

02:26.615 --> 02:27.714
with the one you love.

02:27.816 --> 02:30.184
Whoa! Wait, love?
You dropped the L-bomb?

02:30.286 --> 02:30.985
Oh, God, no.

02:31.087 --> 02:32.052
I love Julie too much

02:32.154 --> 02:33.487
to actually let her <i> know</i> I love her.

02:33.589 --> 02:35.222
You see, every time I tell
a lady friend I love her,

02:35.324 --> 02:36.623
it ends in disaster.

02:36.725 --> 02:38.859
I either say it too early
or I say it at the wrong time.

02:38.961 --> 02:40.761
I even said it to an answering machine.

02:40.863 --> 02:42.363
That did not help me in court.

02:42.464 --> 02:44.731
So, you're <i> never</i> gonna tell
Julie you love her?

02:44.833 --> 02:46.400
Not with my mouth and words.

02:46.502 --> 02:48.502
But this weekend, I am giving her

02:48.604 --> 02:51.238
the perfect six-month anniversary gift

02:51.340 --> 02:53.140
that says "I love you" without
actually having to say it.

02:53.242 --> 02:54.275
Ooh. Whatcha thinking?

02:54.377 --> 02:56.842
I've narrowed it down
to a few romantic gems

02:56.945 --> 03:00.046
that speak to what's really
deep down in my heart.

03:00.148 --> 03:01.480
Blue lady shorts?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.950
Like mine, but for a lady,
because I love her.

03:04.052 --> 03:06.286
You know what gift
<i>really</i> says "I love you"?

03:06.388 --> 03:07.120
What? Tell me.

03:07.222 --> 03:09.055
Actually saying "I love you"!

03:09.157 --> 03:11.190
Oh, you do that well. Maybe
<i>you</i> could tell her I love her.

03:11.293 --> 03:13.026
- No!
- Well,<i> someone</i> has to tell her.

03:13.128 --> 03:14.794
Wait, that's it.

03:14.896 --> 03:16.296
Every time I go see my fam,

03:16.398 --> 03:17.997
I always tell them
how much I love Julie.

03:18.099 --> 03:20.533
They will definitely spill the
beans when they finally meet her.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.002
Introducing her to the family?
Wow. That's big.

03:23.104 --> 03:24.003
Huge.

03:24.105 --> 03:25.271
It's time Julie meets

03:25.373 --> 03:27.440
the most important people in my life.

03:27.542 --> 03:30.443
Julie, I want you to meet
my football family!

03:30.545 --> 03:32.078
ALL: Julie!

03:32.180 --> 03:34.147
Wait, we're... we're not meeting
your <i> actual</i> family?

03:34.249 --> 03:36.448
God, no. I wouldn't waste a Sunday
talking with those crazy people.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.817
This right here is
my real support in life.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.785
We've all had season tickets forever.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.422
Meet Fishtown Frankie, One Yard Jack.

03:43.523 --> 03:44.990
We got Willy wit' Whiz,

03:45.092 --> 03:46.758
and we got Willy wit' out Whiz.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.062
Get ready for the most exciting
6 1/2 hours of your life!

03:50.164 --> 03:51.729
Wait. How long is this game?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.031
Are you hungry?

03:53.100 --> 03:54.599
The Vet's got the best
soft pretzels in all of Philly.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.435
You can have my end nub if you want.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.735
It's the best part.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.671
No, thank you, Fishtown Frankie.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.473
Boy, you were right
about this one, Ricky.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.008
She's polite <i> and</i> pretty.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.943
Tell her what else I said,
like how she makes me feel.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.412
I think it's obvious.
He's head-over-heels in...

04:07.514 --> 04:08.413
ALL: Oh!

04:08.515 --> 04:09.675
Damn it!

04:09.730 --> 04:11.149
<i>As Coach's plan got delayed,</i>

04:11.251 --> 04:12.884
<i>Glascott arrived with urgent news.</i>

04:12.953 --> 04:15.241
Shut up, everyone! We got a
legitimate emergency on our hands!

04:15.266 --> 04:16.265
- What happened?
- Oh, my God.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.732
- Is everyone okay?
- It's a dress-code emergency!

04:18.757 --> 04:20.423
- You are the devil, John!
- Damn you, man!

04:20.493 --> 04:22.093
We've got school tours all this week,

04:22.161 --> 04:24.261
and Earl Ball said
to crack down on the dress code,

04:24.330 --> 04:26.030
so I've sent so many kids to the bin

04:26.132 --> 04:27.965
that I've run out of triple XL muumuus!

04:28.034 --> 04:30.301
- How many naked co-ed sports are there?
- 58.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.844
Co-ed naked sports
was just the beginning.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.104
They keep pushing the limits

04:33.172 --> 04:35.473
to what inappropriate pun
they can print on a T-shirt.

04:35.574 --> 04:37.008
- Like this.
- Oh, God.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.410
Is that worm coming out of
the bucket supposed to be a...

04:39.479 --> 04:41.245
That's right, Elizabeth. It's a dong.

04:41.347 --> 04:42.579
- Mm.
- Can you believe it?

04:42.648 --> 04:44.081
- A dong!
- Ha!

04:44.150 --> 04:47.284
Okay, we need to amend
the school dress code ASAP.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.786
We're talking no clothing
with any kind of sports logos

04:49.855 --> 04:52.323
or band names or cartoon characters.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.991
Sorry, but no exceptions, CB.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.893
From now on, you wear regular ties only.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.628
But these hilarious ties
are what makes me <i> me,</i> okay?

04:58.696 --> 05:01.031
I wear my heart on my sleeve on my tie.

05:01.099 --> 05:03.066
Look, clothes are how people
express themselves,

05:03.168 --> 05:05.135
kinda like how my
super-cute Pearl Jam tee

05:05.203 --> 05:06.369
says I'm cool as balls.

05:06.438 --> 05:07.504
If I allow <i> your</i> band,

05:07.572 --> 05:09.239
then I have to allow bands like this.

05:09.341 --> 05:11.274
Butthole Surfers? That can't be real.

05:11.343 --> 05:12.308
And popular.

05:12.377 --> 05:14.577
To be safe, no more band names.

05:14.646 --> 05:17.780
Sorry, Johnny. Rush included.
Take that T-shirt off.

05:17.849 --> 05:18.848
You got it, boss man.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.850
Shirt back on! Shirt back on!

05:20.952 --> 05:23.353
Look, you can't just ban
entire groups of clothing.

05:23.455 --> 05:25.455
We just got to clearly define
exactly what clothes

05:25.524 --> 05:27.924
are neat, clean, and appropriate
and which aren't.

05:28.026 --> 05:29.025
Well, then, let <i> me</i> define it.

05:29.127 --> 05:30.893
Marvin the Martian is hereby acceptable.

05:30.962 --> 05:32.195
There's a lot at stake here, so I think

05:32.297 --> 05:33.696
it should be headed up
by someone with style.

05:33.765 --> 05:34.797
You're right. I'll do it.

05:34.866 --> 05:35.965
I was talking about me, Liz.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.500
I thought you said style.

05:37.602 --> 05:40.102
ALL: Ooh!

05:40.204 --> 05:41.937
Look at you,
doing the wave like a natural.

05:42.039 --> 05:43.439
Is this great or what?

05:43.507 --> 05:44.473
Listen, you would agree

05:44.542 --> 05:46.308
that we have a strong
relationship, right?

05:46.410 --> 05:47.376
I'd say it's more than strong.

05:47.478 --> 05:48.843
I'd say our relationship is jacked.

05:48.912 --> 05:50.179
So, it won't matter if I admit

05:50.281 --> 05:52.047
that I'm not actually an Eagles fan?

05:52.116 --> 05:55.150
If you're not an Eagles fan,
then w-w-what's your team?

05:55.219 --> 05:57.186
Bucs? Bears? Bills?

05:57.254 --> 05:59.321
Sweet Mother of Mercy,
do not say Cowboys.

05:59.390 --> 06:00.556
No, you're not getting it, Rick.

06:00.624 --> 06:03.125
I-I don't have a team because
I don't like football.

06:03.194 --> 06:05.360
What do you like? Baseball? Basketball?

06:05.429 --> 06:06.595
- No.
- Squash?

06:06.663 --> 06:08.597
Stop naming sports.
It's... It's just not my thing.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.665
Since when? We watched
all those games together.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.201
Because we just started dating.

06:12.269 --> 06:14.736
But like you said,
our relationship is jacked,

06:14.805 --> 06:16.572
so it shouldn't change anything, right?

06:16.673 --> 06:18.439
ALL: Whoa!

06:20.443 --> 06:22.176
Epic game yesterday.

06:22.245 --> 06:24.678
How'd it go with Julie?
Anyone drop the L-bomb?

06:24.747 --> 06:26.114
No. No L-bombs.

06:26.182 --> 06:28.382
But, uh, she did manage to
blow up my entire world.

06:28.451 --> 06:30.718
Turns out she was only
pretending to like the Eagles.

06:30.786 --> 06:33.588
So? It's all good, as long as she's
not a whack-ass Cowboys fan.

06:33.656 --> 06:34.922
Is she a Cowboys fan?

06:34.991 --> 06:36.824
She doesn't like any teams 'cause
she doesn't like football.

06:36.926 --> 06:38.058
- So, she likes baseball?
- Nope.

06:38.128 --> 06:39.393
- Volleyball?
- She doesn't like sports!

06:39.462 --> 06:40.761
What?! Is she some kinda maniac?!

06:40.830 --> 06:42.796
Hey, that's the love of my life
you're talking about!

06:42.865 --> 06:44.565
But yes, she may be a maniac!

06:44.667 --> 06:45.933
I mean, I can't believe this.

06:46.002 --> 06:47.368
I always thought I'd end up

06:47.437 --> 06:49.270
with a female version of myself.

06:49.372 --> 06:50.904
A female Mellor.

06:51.007 --> 06:51.939
A FeMellor.

06:52.008 --> 06:53.307
But I guess not.

06:53.376 --> 06:55.376
I'm so sorry, Rick.

06:55.445 --> 06:57.178
GLASCOTT: All right, Liz,
what kind of clothing

06:57.247 --> 07:00.180
do you find neat, clean,
and appropriate?

07:00.249 --> 07:02.616
Well, for girls, clearly,
a stylish pantsuit

07:02.684 --> 07:04.083
and a funky tortoise-shell barrette.

07:04.153 --> 07:05.718
Wow. Good stuff, Liz.

07:05.820 --> 07:06.719
And for the boys?

07:06.788 --> 07:08.321
I'd like to enter into the record

07:08.423 --> 07:10.290
a 10-page report that I wrote.

I can't wait not to read that.

I'm gonna ignore you entirely
and say the boys should wear

07:18.300 --> 07:20.333
cool khakis, a crisp button-down,

07:20.402 --> 07:21.868
and a matching sweater vest.

07:21.936 --> 07:24.019
- Fine choices, John.
- Are you two kidding me?

07:24.074 --> 07:25.938
You're just writing down
exactly what <i> you're</i> wearing.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.508
Because what we wear is neat,
clean, and appropriate.

07:28.577 --> 07:30.009
You know, how a teacher <i>should</i> dress.

07:30.111 --> 07:31.844

[Chuckling] No, no,
she's not saying that.

That's <i> exactly</i> what I'm saying.

Look, she's wearing
a swimsuit and flip-flops.

07:36.885 --> 07:39.151
For your information,
I got this top at Express,

07:39.221 --> 07:40.653
in the "Look Hot at Work" section.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.222
And these are Steve Madden
fashion-forward work sandals.

- Oh, please.

You've been flipping and flopping
around here all week, girl.

multiple flips <i> and</i> flops

There it was!
A flip, followed by a flop.

I personally did not hear
the flip, but a flop was heard.

07:59.873 --> 08:01.840
Okay, fine. My cute shoes
occasionally flop,

08:01.909 --> 08:03.242

but when will people
hear me out on the ties?

08:19.393 --> 08:21.959
Okay, this is starting to feel
a tad counterproductive.

08:22.061 --> 08:23.561
I'm just saying, we
shouldn't force the students

08:23.663 --> 08:25.697

Janet Reno farted out.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.565
Likewise, the students shouldn't dress

09:14.725 --> 09:15.824

09:15.849 --> 09:18.090
