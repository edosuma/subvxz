00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.710 --> 00:12.544
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.546 --> 00:15.114
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:15.116 --> 00:17.850
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.852 --> 00:20.152
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.154 --> 00:22.521
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.523 --> 00:25.691
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.693 --> 00:29.661
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.663 --> 00:33.699
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.701 --> 00:36.702
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.704 --> 00:38.337
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.339 --> 00:40.739
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.741 --> 00:43.175
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.177 --> 00:45.711
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.713 --> 00:51.583
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:01.729 --> 01:03.495
Oh, isn't this fun?

01:03.497 --> 01:05.998
There's only thing
I love more than decorating.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.599
Redecorating!

01:07.601 --> 01:10.102
Could you move the tapestry
a bit higher?

01:11.338 --> 01:12.905
An inch to the right.

01:12.907 --> 01:16.742
An inch and three-quarters
to the left.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.445
On second thought,
please hang it
in the other room.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.358
Hmm. Strange.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.361
One pretty little tile,
all alone on that wall.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.701
What in the world?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.970
Where am I?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.805
Is this...

01:46.807 --> 01:49.875
Oh, a secret passageway?

01:52.113 --> 01:55.914
Stairs? Leading
under the castle?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.117
I can't believe
this was here all along,

01:58.119 --> 01:59.985
and I never knew
about it.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.954
Oh, this would've been
the best hiding place

02:01.956 --> 02:03.689
when I was little.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.796
Oh, wow.
What is this place?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.598
( thudding sound )

02:12.600 --> 02:13.966
Footsteps?
Who can that be?

02:13.968 --> 02:16.869
Oh, what do I do?
What do I do?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.507
Sofia?

02:21.509 --> 02:22.774
What are you
doing here?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.677
Me? Amber, what
are you doing here?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.646
You're not
going to believe this.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.515
I was redecorating
my room,

02:29.517 --> 02:30.849
when I found
a hidden door

02:30.851 --> 02:33.819
behind a tapestry,
and it led me here.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.687
Well, you're not
supposed to be here.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.489
You need to go back.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.857
But what is all this?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.359
What are you up to
down here?

02:40.361 --> 02:42.427
I can't say.

02:43.964 --> 02:47.866
Sofia, your
amulet's glowing.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.369
Is that a boat?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.804
Wait a minute.
Your amulet glows,

02:52.806 --> 02:54.840
and now this boat
appears?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.975
Did your amulet
do that?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.844
Is your amulet magical?

02:58.846 --> 03:01.680
I'm sorry, Amber.
I really don't have
time to explain.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.849
I really have to
get somewhere,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.551
and you
have to go back.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.853
- Is that so?
- What are you doing?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.888
You don't actually
think I'm leaving

03:09.890 --> 03:12.191
now that I'm in
this amazing secret
passageway,

03:12.193 --> 03:14.326
and your amulet's
summoning magic gondolas,
do you?

03:14.328 --> 03:17.863
Amber, I'm asking you,
please, leave right now.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.866
No, Sofia.
I want to see everything,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.068
and I want to know
everything, too.

03:23.070 --> 03:27.139
Somehow, my amulet
decided that I was to
become the story keeper.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.241
Now it's my job
to make sure

03:29.243 --> 03:31.343
the stories in
the secret library
get a happy ending.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.745
So your amulet glows,
and leads you here

03:33.747 --> 03:37.082
to this secret library
which is filled with stories

03:37.084 --> 03:38.817
that you need to finish?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.552
I don't know why;
it just happened.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.924
Here comes a book now.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.844
AMBER:<i> "The Tale of</i>
<i> the Crystal Masters."</i>

04:05.846 --> 04:07.479
That sounds incredible.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.958
BOOK NARRATOR:<i> High above</i>
<i> the highest clouds,</i>

04:19.960 --> 04:22.094
<i> past the bluest moon,</i>

04:22.096 --> 04:25.130
<i> float the legendary</i>
<i> Mystic Isles.</i>

04:25.132 --> 04:27.866
Mr. Cedric told me
about the Mystic Isles.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.135
He said that all magic
comes from there.

04:30.137 --> 04:34.039
<i> The Mystic Isles are made up</i>
<i> of countless floating islands.</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:35.941
<i> Each one is home</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:38.810
<i> to different magical</i>
<i> creatures and objects.</i>

04:38.812 --> 04:40.979
SOFIA: That must be
the Isle of Centaurs.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.814
And that's
the Isle of Unicorns.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.949
Unicorns?!

04:43.951 --> 04:45.550
<i> For centuries,</i>

04:45.552 --> 04:47.819
<i> crystal masters</i>
<i> on the Isle of Crystals</i>

04:47.821 --> 04:49.788
<i> have peacefully grown</i>
<i> magic crystals</i>

04:49.790 --> 04:52.991
<i> for wizards everywhere</i>
<i> to use in their scepters,</i>

04:52.993 --> 04:54.626
<i> wands and amulets.</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:57.329
- I wonder if yours
came from there.
- Maybe.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.265
<i> But one crystal master</i>
<i> has a wicked plan</i>

05:00.267 --> 05:03.902
<i> to grow magic crystals</i>
<i> on the other Mystic Isles.</i>

05:03.904 --> 05:06.271
<i> Doing this will drain</i>
<i> all the magic</i>

05:06.273 --> 05:08.974
<i> from the creatures</i>
<i> who live there, forever.</i>

05:10.411 --> 05:11.843
- Oh, no.
- Wait.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.812
Where's the rest
of the story?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.915
Remember, it's my job
as story keeper
to finish it.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.917
I have to go
to the Mystic Isles,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.285
to stop
that crystal master,

05:20.287 --> 05:21.920
and give this story
a happy ending.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.855
Well, what are
we waiting for?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.924
Let's go do
some story fixing.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.426
Story keeping.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.795
Amber, you can't
go with me.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.263
Why not?

05:31.265 --> 05:33.598
Because I'm
the story keeper,
not you.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.435
So no one else can have
secret adventures
and magical amulets but you.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.170
Is that it?

05:38.172 --> 05:39.938
I didn't say that.
It's just...

05:39.940 --> 05:42.207
It could be dangerous.
I can't let you go.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.876
Fine. I'll go back
to my plain old,

05:44.878 --> 05:47.212
very safe life, Sofia.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.381
All I want is to go
to the Mystic Isles

05:49.383 --> 05:51.616
and find an amulet
of my own,

05:51.618 --> 05:53.452
so I can have my own
special adventures.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.220
I don't know, Amber.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.521
Think about it, Sofia.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.890
Is it fair that
you're the only one

05:58.892 --> 06:01.393
who has a magic amulet
and gets to do all
these special things?

06:01.395 --> 06:04.563
( sighs ) No,
I guess not.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.231
Oh, all right.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.066
You can come...
this one time.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.302
Oh, thank you.

06:10.304 --> 06:13.739
As long as you remember,
we're going to
the Mystic Isles

06:13.741 --> 06:15.540
to help give this story
a happy ending.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.376
Yes. Of course.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.212
Now we just have to
figure out how to get there.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.884
Or... maybe the library's
going to do it for us.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.819
What do you mean?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.388
I think it wants
to take us there.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.089
- Come on.
- Wait. What
is this thing?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.958
It's the enchanted
elevator.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.996
Uh, how high
does this thing go?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.931
Usually, it takes me
to the very top

06:39.933 --> 06:41.800
of the secret library.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.938
Sofia, where's this thing
taking us?!

06:46.940 --> 06:50.642
Whoo! Well, it's
definitely taking us
somewhere.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.351
That's funny.
We're landing.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.254
Why? The book said
the Mystic Isles
are up, not down.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.130
Look. These are
the same flowers

07:12.132 --> 07:14.232
that are on
the enchanted elevator.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.302
There must be a way
to get to the Mystic
Isles from here.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.038
Let's hope so.
There goes our ride.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.113
What are we even
supposed to be
looking for?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.081
I'm not sure.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.585
Maybe a flying coach
or a magical creature
or a... girl!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.821
Oh, my.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.123
Oh, I do hope
I didn't startle you.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.560
Oh, that crystal
looks so familiar.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.962
It's magical,
isn't it?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.997
Uh, yes.
How did you know?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.967
Oh, I know an awful lot
about magic crystals.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.303
You see,
I'm a crystal master.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.104
At least, I was once.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.106
What do you mean,
once?

07:55.108 --> 07:57.576
My terribly unkind
sister Azurine

07:57.578 --> 07:59.177
took my crystal powers away.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.112
She turned my beautiful
crystal self

08:01.114 --> 08:03.315
into the regular girl
you see before you.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.484
I had to flee our home
in the Mystic Isles,

08:05.486 --> 08:07.085
and now,
I'm trying to get back.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.454
Oh, we're headed to
the Mystic Isles

08:09.456 --> 08:11.690
to stop a mean
crystal master right now.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.458
That must be
your sister.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.293
You think so?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.795
Oh, do let me
come with you.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.263
If I get
my powers back,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.365
I can help you
stop Azurine.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.001
Well, we could always
use another hand.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.870
Sure, we'll take you
with us.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.672
Oh, thank you.
Thank you ever so much.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.174
I'm Prisma,
by the way.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.709
Princess Sofia.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.277
Princess Amber.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.112
This must be
my lucky day.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.448
I've been wandering
this field waiting and hoping

08:36.450 --> 08:38.650
- for the unicorns.
- Unicorns?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.319
Yes, to come fly me
back to the Isles.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.955
But now, your amulet
can summon them.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.690
You simply must ask it.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.559
Really? It can
summon the unicorns?

08:47.561 --> 08:50.061
Oh, you see why
I want an amulet?

08:50.063 --> 08:52.030
Okay, I'll try.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.367
Um, please send
some unicorns.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.109
( unicorns whinnying )

09:12.586 --> 09:16.021
Who summons the unicorns
of the Mystic Isles?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.188
Uh, hi.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.190
I'm Sofia
of Enchancia,

09:19.192 --> 09:20.992
and this is
my sister Amber.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.095
Do you wish for passage
to the Mystic Isles?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.564
Yes, please.
Wait!

09:25.566 --> 09:29.568
I can understand
unicorns?!

09:29.570 --> 09:32.170
Yes. Every creature
from the Mystic Isles

09:32.172 --> 09:33.939
can magically talk
to others.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.774
Quickly, girls,
hop on.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.136
It's so beautiful.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.373
We're not there yet.
We must climb even higher.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.626
Welcome to
the Mystic Isles.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.761
Oh, how wonderful
it is to be back.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.230
So on all your
story keeper adventures,

10:32.232 --> 10:34.733
your amulet's been leading
you to places like this?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.301
I've never seen
anyplace like this.

10:37.471 --> 10:41.272
- SOFIA: Dragons!
- That's the Isle of Dragons.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.174
And that's
the Isle of Wishes.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.176
SOFIA: This place
is amazing.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.782
Can we go to
that Isle of Wishes?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.984
I'd like to wish for
a certain something.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.787
I'll give you a hint.
It rhymes with "pamulet."

10:55.789 --> 10:57.489
Maybe after we stop
Azurine.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.357
Right. Of course.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.259
Oh, let's ride
a unicorn there.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.994
Yoo-hoo, unicorn!

11:04.965 --> 11:08.299
Oh, Amber, I'm sure
my sister will be
watching the skies,

11:08.301 --> 11:10.769
and would see us
flying in on unicorns.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.371
I'm afraid we must
go on foot.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.340
Oh. I guess you're right.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.677
Clear yon path!
Quick as a lick!

11:21.381 --> 11:22.614
( all exclaiming )

11:22.616 --> 11:25.183
- ( groaning )
- Are you okay?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.718
Fear not, kind maiden.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.853
I was merely testing
my new wings.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.288
New wings?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.390
Flying unicorns
get their wings

11:32.392 --> 11:34.225
when they reach
a certain age.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.027
Specifically,
my age.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.902
- Perhaps a touch
of assistance.
- Of course.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.106
( grunting )

11:49.543 --> 11:51.576
You're really stuck.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.185
Oh, sweet freedom.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.053
Thank you
ever so muchly.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.189
And to repay you
for freeing me,

12:04.191 --> 12:07.592
by the magic of my horn,
I, Skye the unicorn,

12:07.594 --> 12:10.428
vow to accompany you...
you...

12:10.430 --> 12:11.496
Princess Sofia.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.199
Princess Sofia,
and serve you

12:14.201 --> 12:16.201
as your loyal
and eternally
devoted helper,

12:16.203 --> 12:18.503
now and forever.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.506
We're heading to
the Isle of Crystals,

12:21.508 --> 12:23.241
and like I said before,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.243
we can always use
another hand.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.878
Or hoof.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.379
Come with us.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.049
It shall be
my honor,
my lady.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.017
Wonderful. Now we
must go lickety-split.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.285
We're in quite a rush.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.288
I shall lead you to
yon path ahead.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.698
( muttering )

12:46.700 --> 12:49.033
Perhaps I should walk.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.403
It's okay.
We can walk together.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.305
Maybe you can point out some of
the sights along the way.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.974
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.409
Yes, we shall walk.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.712
It would be my honor
to give you a guided tour.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.413
Look all around.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.382
Feast your eyes
as we explore

13:04.384 --> 13:07.152
the magic of
the Mystic Isles.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.887
¶ Come with me ¶

13:08.889 --> 13:10.722
¶ Right this way ¶

13:10.724 --> 13:13.158
¶ Let's walk,
no, let's run ¶

13:13.160 --> 13:16.928
¶ For this is
the place ¶

13:16.930 --> 13:19.631
¶ Where all magic
comes from ¶

13:19.633 --> 13:22.467
¶ Every isle that you see ¶

13:22.469 --> 13:26.137
¶ Is called home sweet home ¶

13:26.139 --> 13:29.407
¶ By all magical creatures ¶

13:29.409 --> 13:32.477
¶ From griffin
to gnome ¶

13:32.479 --> 13:34.979
¶ Take it in ¶

13:34.981 --> 13:38.082
¶ This is where ¶

13:38.084 --> 13:43.988
¶ All magic begins ¶

13:45.325 --> 13:48.326
¶ Behold,
the Isle of Wishes ¶

13:48.328 --> 13:51.462
¶ Every dream
is granted there ¶

13:51.464 --> 13:53.698
¶ And on the Mermaid Isle ¶

13:53.700 --> 13:56.835
¶ Girls with fins
splash everywhere ¶

13:56.837 --> 13:59.771
¶ Eyes up,
the Isle of Dragons ¶

13:59.773 --> 14:02.640
¶ Where those creatures
roar with flair ¶

14:02.642 --> 14:05.443
¶ And on
the Isle of Centaurs ¶

14:05.445 --> 14:11.349
¶ Men are part horse,
women mare ¶

14:11.351 --> 14:14.018
¶ The magic
goes on for miles ¶

14:14.020 --> 14:17.822
¶ The magic of
the Mystic Isles ¶

14:17.824 --> 14:20.792
¶ Behold the magic ¶

14:20.794 --> 14:28.566
¶ Of the Mystic Isles ¶

14:28.568 --> 14:30.969
So did the dragons
and mermaids in our world

14:30.971 --> 14:32.537
come from here?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.239
Or their parents did.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.541
You see, my princess,
if not for the magic here,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.977
there would be
no magic anywhere.

14:38.979 --> 14:42.046
¶ I must do
all that I can ¶

14:42.048 --> 14:45.416
¶ To keep the magic here
in this land ¶

14:45.418 --> 14:47.819
¶ On these isles,
there's gotta be ¶

14:47.821 --> 14:53.558
¶ A rare enchanted jewel
that's just for me ¶

14:53.560 --> 14:56.494
¶ For me ¶

14:56.496 --> 14:59.430
¶ Look left,
the Isle of Memories ¶

14:59.432 --> 15:01.699
¶ Go re-live a deja vu ¶

15:01.701 --> 15:04.769
¶ And if you like
flying carpets ¶

15:04.771 --> 15:07.405
¶ Have I got
the isle for you ¶

15:07.407 --> 15:10.208
¶ Hey ho,
the Isle of Beanstalks ¶

15:10.210 --> 15:13.511
¶ Tallest plants
that ever grew ¶

15:13.513 --> 15:16.281
¶ And on
the Isle of Fairies ¶

15:16.283 --> 15:21.686
¶ The cutest things
that ever flew ¶

15:21.688 --> 15:24.689
¶ The magic
goes on for miles ¶

15:24.691 --> 15:28.192
¶ The magic of
the Mystic Isles ¶

15:28.194 --> 15:30.461
¶ Behold the magic ¶

15:30.463 --> 15:33.264
¶ Yes, the marvelous
and mystical ¶

15:33.266 --> 15:36.034
¶ The majestic, magnificent ¶

15:36.036 --> 15:50.982
¶ Magic of
the Mystic Isles ¶

15:53.420 --> 15:55.820
Okay, what's next?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.488
All we have to do
is cross this isle,

15:57.490 --> 16:00.325
then we shall get to
the Isle of Crystals.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.661
Onward. Through the Isle
of Dancing Deserts.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.742
I don't understand.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.510
How is this
a dancing desert?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.779
These wondrous magic sands
will show you

16:21.781 --> 16:23.581
anything you want them to.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.750
Allow me
to demonstrate.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.586
Good sands,
show me a dragon.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.826
- Wow!
- ( ferocious roaring )

16:34.828 --> 16:37.829
Back, O sandy reptile.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.831
You are frightening
my princess.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.733
( whimpers )

16:43.703 --> 16:45.503
That's amazing.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.572
Can I see a castle?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.511
AMBER: It looks
just like our castle.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.546
Oh, look,
there's my room.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.149
I know this is all
so very magical, Sofia,

16:58.151 --> 16:59.884
but the magic will
soon be gone

16:59.886 --> 17:02.553
if we don't hurry up
and stop Azurine.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.189
Sands, please show us
the way to

17:05.191 --> 17:07.125
the Isle of Crystals.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.297
Wait.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.535
I didn't get to ask the sands
for anything.

17:17.537 --> 17:21.072
Show me
a magic jewel.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.582
There's nothing there.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.684
We really should
press on anyway.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.753
There must be
magic jewels over there,

17:35.755 --> 17:37.989
or why would the sands
show it to us?

17:37.991 --> 17:39.490
( panting )

17:39.492 --> 17:41.626
Where are you,
little jewels?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.595
( gasps )

17:44.597 --> 17:46.731
So sparkly.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.633
I told you.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.336
Oh, I bet you're magical,

17:52.338 --> 17:54.105
just like Sofia's amulet.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.407
I wish to be
invisible.

17:58.044 --> 18:01.846
Oh, I want to grow
really big.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.584
Why won't this work?

18:06.586 --> 18:09.220
Please, Amber,
we must be going.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.924
Okay. Coming.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.601
Just over this bridge
lies my beautiful crystal home.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.636
Can you give me
the power to fly?

18:25.638 --> 18:28.806
Um, can you give me
that power, too?

18:28.808 --> 18:32.210
Oh! What is wrong
with this jewel?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.712
Why won't it work?

18:36.082 --> 18:37.648
Amber, what have you done?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.851
- ( screaming )
- Sofia!

18:43.823 --> 18:45.656
SKYE: We have to
get off this bridge.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.125
Fast!

18:56.903 --> 18:58.870
Thank you.
You saved us.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.275
Who are you?
What are you?

19:04.277 --> 19:06.644
And where do I get
a magic bracelet like that?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.813
My name is Orion.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.148
I am a wind walker,

19:10.150 --> 19:12.150
and a Protector
of the Mystic Isles.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.351
A Protector?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.686
The Protectors keep
everyone in the Isles

19:15.688 --> 19:17.355
from harm's way.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.924
That is, of course,
when I am not available.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.594
Well, that broken bridge
could've caused a lot of harm.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.163
You should talk to
whoever built it.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.331
It's your magic stone
that caused the trouble.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.267
That is a shatter stone.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.469
If you strike something
with it three times,

19:31.471 --> 19:34.138
this powerful rock
will magically shatter it.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.040
But I found it
in the sand,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.775
looking so harmless
and dazzling.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.045
Actually, shatter stones
come from another isle.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.181
We Protectors thought it
safest to store them here

19:43.183 --> 19:44.715
in the Dancing Desert.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.985
Sand cannot break
since it is already broken.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.521
Sounds like you have to
leave the stone here, Amber.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.056
Oh, fine.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.364
Good-bye, shiny friend.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.336
Now I must go.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.238
There is a dangerous
crystal master on the loose,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.140
and I have to find her.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.075
We're looking
for her, too.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.743
I'm the story keeper,

20:12.745 --> 20:14.045
and it's my job
to try and stop her.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.747
Of course.
The story keeper.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.550
I wondered what you beings
from the ever realm

20:19.552 --> 20:21.319
- were doing here.
- The ever realm?

20:21.321 --> 20:23.821
That's what we of the isles
call your world.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.590
We're bound for
the Isle of Crystals,

20:25.592 --> 20:27.558
my good man,
to search for this villain.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.060
I have just come
from that isle,

20:29.062 --> 20:30.828
and did not
find her there.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.530
Please, keep a lookout.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.565
This crystal master
presents a grave threat

20:34.567 --> 20:36.234
to our isles.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.735
Be safe, my friends.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.939
I don't understand.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.875
If Azurine isn't
on the Isle of Crystals,

20:44.877 --> 20:46.077
where could she be?

20:46.079 --> 20:48.346
My sister is cunning.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.081
She must've hidden
from Orion,

20:50.083 --> 20:51.882
or tricked him somehow.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.884
I'm sure she's on
the Isle of Crystals.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.885
We must hurry.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.521
But wait.
This bridge is gone.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.090
Oh, Amber!

20:59.092 --> 21:00.958
I just wanted
a special jewel of my own,

21:00.960 --> 21:02.693
like your amulet.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.829
We shall have to find
some other way there.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.399
Noble sands, please
show us another way

21:08.401 --> 21:10.101
to the Isle of Crystals.

21:17.910 --> 21:21.545
Oh, that looks
really far away.

21:21.547 --> 21:22.747
Indeed.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.982
It appears we must cross
yet another isle

21:24.984 --> 21:26.617
before we get to
the Isle of Crystals.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.785
We better hurry then.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.820
Yes, the longer
we delay,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.155
the closer
my sister gets

21:31.157 --> 21:33.457
to taking over
the Mystic Isles.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.611
What isle are we on now,
the Isle of Mess?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.813
This is
the Isle of Rompkins.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.351
We got visitors.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.820
SKYE: Stay back!

22:02.822 --> 22:05.956
Visitors. We never
get visitors.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.758
Ooh, look at her.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.494
Aw, so small.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.699
Ooh, come on in,
visitors.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.901
Have a seat.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.838
We're so happy you came.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.640
We're happy
anybody came.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.308
Back, back, I say.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.444
Away from my princess.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.812
Off the table.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.847
Let's smash a toast.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.482
Yes!

22:31.484 --> 22:33.617
Unhand us,
you brutes!

22:33.619 --> 22:35.052
( laughs )

22:35.054 --> 22:37.688
I am ever so sorry,
big fellows,

22:37.690 --> 22:40.324
but we have to leave.
Immediately.

22:40.326 --> 22:43.027
It's true. We're on
a really important journey.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.995
But you just got here.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.564
You have to stay.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.399
No, we have to leave.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.001
Why does everyone
always leave?

22:51.003 --> 22:52.570
( all crying )

22:52.572 --> 22:55.873
No one ever
wants to stay on our isle.

22:55.875 --> 23:00.010
Everyone's always scared
of us.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.313
I don't know why.

23:02.315 --> 23:07.084
Nobody even stays long
enough to try this on.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.986
Ooh, what is that?

23:08.988 --> 23:11.155
It's the crown
of our queen.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.023
May I see it?

23:13.025 --> 23:16.060
- Amber, we have to go.
- We really, truly do.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.729
You guys, look at this.
It's so wonderfully shiny!

23:18.731 --> 23:22.032
Is this crown
in any way magical?

23:22.034 --> 23:24.101
Oh, smack!

23:24.103 --> 23:27.104
We forgot to say,
once you put the crown on,

23:27.106 --> 23:28.873
you become
our queen.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.341
Your queen?

23:30.343 --> 23:32.743
Double smack!

23:32.745 --> 23:35.946
We also forgot to say
once you're our queen,

23:35.948 --> 23:39.083
you're our queen
forever!

23:39.085 --> 23:42.119
- Wait, forever?
- ALL: Our queen forever.

23:42.121 --> 23:46.090
- What are you talking about?
I can't stay here forever.
- None of us can.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.526
Our queen forever!
Our queen forever!

23:48.528 --> 23:51.061
- Oh, no!
- Our queen forever!

23:51.063 --> 23:53.130
Our queen forever!

23:53.132 --> 23:56.300
If we can't get out of here,
we can't stop Azurine.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.936
We must attempt
a daring escape.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.372
I have an idea.

24:01.374 --> 24:03.741
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

24:03.743 --> 24:05.409
Excuse me!!

24:05.411 --> 24:06.744
Hold it, boys.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.446
( sighs )

24:08.448 --> 24:09.780
Thank you.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.549
Now, gentlemen,

24:11.551 --> 24:13.584
do you know why no one
ever wants to come to your isle?

24:13.586 --> 24:15.386
No. Not really.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.254
- Not one clue.
- Don't ask me.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.089
Because you're too rough.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.560
We don't mean to bash
and smash so much, miss.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.929
It's just
what Rompkins do.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.132
I know, but that's why you
should let your queen help you.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.500
Wait, what?

24:29.502 --> 24:31.936
Let our queen help us?

24:31.938 --> 24:35.573
Let your queen help you
become calmer, daintier
Rompkins.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.741
Oh, that's right.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.511
As your queen,
I can help you.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.981
But you must follow
our royal plan.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.785
¶ Step one of
the royal plan ¶

24:47.787 --> 24:49.987
¶ Is to do
all that you can ¶

24:49.989 --> 24:54.091
¶ To romp
much more delicately ¶

24:54.093 --> 24:56.494
¶ Left, right, we go ¶

24:56.496 --> 24:57.995
¶ Whoa, whoa whoa, whoa ¶

24:57.997 --> 24:59.997
¶ Pinky up,
you sip your drink ¶

24:59.999 --> 25:02.366
¶ When you toast,
make a gentle clink ¶

25:02.368 --> 25:06.170
¶ Then set your chairs
down carefully ¶

25:06.172 --> 25:08.873
¶ Set down soft...
oh! ¶

25:08.875 --> 25:10.374
Not in there!
Oh, no!

25:10.376 --> 25:14.445
¶ You'll be at
your Rompkin best ¶

25:14.447 --> 25:18.816
¶ Following
your queen's request ¶

25:18.818 --> 25:20.518
¶ Don't be brash ¶

25:20.520 --> 25:22.453
¶ When you smash ¶

25:22.455 --> 25:24.221
¶ Step light ¶

25:24.223 --> 25:27.291
¶ It's more polite ¶

25:27.293 --> 25:28.359
¶ Just act cute ¶

25:28.361 --> 25:30.494
¶ Not like a brute ¶

25:30.496 --> 25:32.162
¶ If you clang ¶

25:32.164 --> 25:34.632
¶ Try not to bang ¶

25:36.702 --> 25:38.869
Try again, Harumph

25:38.871 --> 25:40.905
Put the mug
down gently.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.842
Hmm.

25:44.844 --> 25:48.212
Oh, this time,
imagine that the mug

25:48.214 --> 25:50.381
is a baby bird.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.653
No bash!
I'm a gentle giant now,

25:55.655 --> 25:58.722
thanks to
my queen.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.159
¶ Now that you are
gentle guys ¶

26:02.161 --> 26:04.695
¶ Your queen is needed
'cross the skies ¶

26:04.697 --> 26:07.998
¶ She wishes you
to set her free ¶

26:08.000 --> 26:09.166
( Rompkins groaning )

26:09.168 --> 26:11.001
Go free,
boo-hoo.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.003
¶ But she has
work to do ¶

26:13.005 --> 26:15.072
( groaning )

26:15.074 --> 26:16.740
Well...

26:16.742 --> 26:19.176
¶ As much as it will
break our heart ¶

26:19.178 --> 26:21.245
¶ We'll allow you
to depart ¶

26:21.247 --> 26:23.380
¶ We'll miss our queen
most terribly ¶

26:23.382 --> 26:25.115
( sobbing )

26:25.117 --> 26:29.119
¶ You are at
your Rompkin best ¶

26:29.121 --> 26:33.290
¶ When you heed
your queen's request ¶

26:33.292 --> 26:35.893
¶ To set us free ¶

26:35.895 --> 26:37.227
¶ Oh, happily ¶

26:37.229 --> 26:39.196
¶ Gotta go ¶

26:39.198 --> 26:40.764
¶ We'll miss you so ¶

26:40.766 --> 26:43.267
¶ Quite well done ¶

26:43.269 --> 26:45.869
¶ And kinda fun ¶

26:45.871 --> 26:49.239
¶ Now we can rest,
'cause she's impressed ¶

26:49.241 --> 26:55.946
¶ And we fulfilled
our queen's request ¶

26:59.118 --> 27:01.318
Here you are.
You can go.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.754
SOFIA: Thank you.
I guess it's good-bye then.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.222
So long,
big fellows.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.124
Fare thee well, friends.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.792
Bye, queen-queen.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.828
Sniff, sniff.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.396
Good luck
saving the magic.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.132
Good-bye, Harumph.
I hope I see you again.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.334
I hope I see
you again, too.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.803
Crack.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.338
That's my heart
breaking.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.506
( whimpers )

27:22.508 --> 27:24.708
( all saying good-bye )

27:33.152 --> 27:36.286
At long last,
the Isle of Crystals.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.088
Oh, we made it.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.624
My beautiful
crystal home.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.326
- How I've missed you.
- Oh, look at that.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.362
Is that a crystal butterfly?

27:45.364 --> 27:46.964
It is!

27:46.966 --> 27:48.966
I've never seen
so much sparkle.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.335
PRISMA: There's
Azurine's farm.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.204
SOFIA: But where's
the wicked crystal master?

27:54.206 --> 27:56.206
All I see
is a farmer.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.208
That's Azurine.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.144
My sister may look
sweet and innocent,

28:00.146 --> 28:03.180
but I promise you,
she is not.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.649
That's where she locked
up my Terra crystal.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.818
What's that?

28:07.820 --> 28:10.320
The tool we crystal masters
use to grow magic crystals.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.223
I must have it if
I'm going to stop Azurine.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.326
Okay, then how can we
get past her to get it?

28:16.328 --> 28:18.295
I shall fetch
the Terra crystal

28:18.297 --> 28:21.198
for my princess.
Head down, hooves moving.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.434
( straining )

28:25.204 --> 28:26.503
Skye, are you okay?

28:26.505 --> 28:28.405
I was not harmed.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.340
Much.

28:30.342 --> 28:33.410
But perhaps someone else
should get the Terra crystal.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.316
I know. I'll use
my amulet to turn
into a bird.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.419
Then I can fly to the silo
to get the Terra crystal.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.254
Oh, how clever.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.824
I just knew your amulet
would save the day.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.827
Thank you, Sofia.
An eternity
of thank-yous.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.062
I wish to be
a crystal bird.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.373
Oh, thank goodness
she's got it.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.041
Here she comes.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.886
Oh, no!
My Terra crystal.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.788
- My princess.
- Sofia's trapped.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.022
( peeping )

29:57.496 --> 30:00.230
Don't worry,
my little friend.
I'll get you free.

30:01.967 --> 30:06.403
Oh! Sofia is in
grave danger from
my wicked sister.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.674
Amber, I can protect her
if you quickly fetch
my Terra crystal.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.843
Me?

30:12.845 --> 30:15.078
If Azurine sees me here,
all of this will have
been for nothing.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.915
And if you get it,
I promise I'll make you

30:17.917 --> 30:20.517
your very own
magical amulet,

30:20.519 --> 30:24.454
just as sparkly and shiny
and special as your sister's.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.490
Oh, I'll be right back.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.406
There you go,
little one.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.679
Something's not right.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.782
Would a wicked crystal master
really be so nice?

31:00.526 --> 31:02.559
I wish to be
myself again.

31:04.797 --> 31:08.232
Wait, Amber, I suddenly
have a bad feeling about this.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.534
Oh, but Sofia, Prisma
really needs this.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.169
Wait, Amber!

31:12.171 --> 31:14.838
And besides, she's going
to make me my own amulet.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.374
- Here you
are, Prisma.
- No!

31:17.376 --> 31:20.477
Oh, thank you, Amber,
so very much.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.845
Don't.

31:21.847 --> 31:25.382
Finally, I have
my Terra crystal back.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.451
<i> Crystalo!</i>

31:34.159 --> 31:35.492
Wow!

31:35.494 --> 31:39.029
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

31:39.031 --> 31:41.465
<i> Crystalo!</i>

31:48.340 --> 31:51.174
It feels so wonderful,
so powerful,

31:51.176 --> 31:53.543
to make crystals again.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.545
Now the magic of
the Mystic Isles

31:55.547 --> 31:58.415
will all be mine!

31:58.417 --> 32:00.851
You said that was
Azurine's plan.

32:00.853 --> 32:03.420
Oh, did I say that?
Do forgive me.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.857
I misspoke.
It was my plan all along.

32:06.859 --> 32:09.693
So then, the wicked
crystal grower in the book

32:09.695 --> 32:11.094
is you?

32:11.096 --> 32:12.763
( giggles )

32:12.765 --> 32:14.431
I'm sorry if I was
a tad unclear.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.832
Prisma!

32:17.403 --> 32:18.468
Prisma?

32:18.470 --> 32:20.604
Hello, dear sister.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.472
<i> Crystalo!</i>

32:28.881 --> 32:30.447
- ( both gasping )
- Oh!

32:33.719 --> 32:35.485
Why are you
doing this?

32:35.487 --> 32:39.056
Why? Oh, it's
a really good story.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.558
Pull up a chair,
and I'll tell you
all about it.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.527
<i> Crystalo!</i>

32:50.903 --> 32:54.137
<i> Crystalo!</i>

32:58.644 --> 33:02.245
¶ Back when we were
just little crystal kids ¶

33:02.247 --> 33:05.916
¶ My sister
was always the star ¶

33:05.918 --> 33:09.987
¶ Her talent was praised
all across the isles ¶

33:09.989 --> 33:13.690
¶ While people said
mine was sub-par ¶

33:13.692 --> 33:15.325
<i> Crystalo!</i>

33:15.327 --> 33:18.829
¶ And when sorcerers needed
magic gems ¶

33:18.831 --> 33:21.264
¶ Who did they come to? ¶

33:21.266 --> 33:23.100
¶ My sis ¶

33:23.102 --> 33:26.870
¶ I felt so left out,
how much it hurt ¶

33:26.872 --> 33:32.776
¶ When I was just
simply dismissed ¶

33:32.778 --> 33:34.578
¶ But those days
are over now ¶

33:35.981 --> 33:40.317
¶ 'Cause I'll soon be known
throughout the land ¶

33:40.319 --> 33:44.121
¶ My crystals finally
in demand ¶

33:44.123 --> 33:48.158
¶ And when I make
my big premiere ¶

33:48.160 --> 33:55.032
¶ My power will be
crystal clear ¶

33:55.034 --> 33:56.733
<i> Crystalo!</i>

33:59.171 --> 34:03.073
¶ I'll use the magic
of the isles ¶

34:03.075 --> 34:06.843
¶ To make
new crystals grow ¶

34:06.845 --> 34:10.647
¶ And if some creatures
lose their charms ¶

34:10.649 --> 34:14.851
¶ It's just
the way it goes ¶

34:14.853 --> 34:18.188
¶ So let's get on
with the show ¶

34:18.190 --> 34:22.392
¶ I'll soon be known
throughout the land ¶

34:22.394 --> 34:26.196
¶ My crystals finally
in demand ¶

34:26.198 --> 34:29.933
¶ And when I make
my big premiere ¶

34:29.935 --> 34:37.674
¶ Then it will all be
crystal clear ¶

34:37.676 --> 34:45.048
¶ My power will be
crystal clear ¶

34:45.050 --> 34:58.595
¶ Yes, it will all be
crystal clear ¶

35:04.303 --> 35:07.471
And I lived
happily ever after.

35:07.473 --> 35:10.540
Now be honest, wasn't that
a great story?

35:10.542 --> 35:12.442
You can't go through
with it, Prisma.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.212
Of course I can,
silly girl.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.414
Oh, and before I forget,

35:17.416 --> 35:19.749
here's that amulet
I promised you, Amber.

35:19.751 --> 35:23.120
After all, I owe this
all to you.

35:23.122 --> 35:27.124
But I never wanted
any of this to happen.

35:27.126 --> 35:30.227
Now, friends, I'm afraid
it's time for you to go.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.028
<i> Crystalo!</i>

35:36.668 --> 35:38.869
Toodle-oo!

35:41.807 --> 35:43.840
Amber, grab onto Skye.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.809
He can fly us
out of here.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.777
Got him.

35:47.779 --> 35:52.182
Alas, my princesses, I still
do not quite know how to fly.

35:52.184 --> 35:56.186
SOFIA: Try, Skye. Try!
You've got to try.

35:56.188 --> 35:59.489
I can, I can.
I cannot.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.258
Maybe if we try together.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.360
I wish to be
a flying unicorn.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.865
Flap those wings, Skye.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.868
I shall flap as I have
never flapped before.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.770
I wish to be a unicorn.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.806
A flying bird.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.108
A dragonfly.

36:18.110 --> 36:20.477
Oh, it's not working.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.846
It's okay, Amber.
Skye and I can do this.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.719
SKYE: Landings
are tricky.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.122
Brace the knees,
keep the wings outstretched.

36:32.124 --> 36:34.791
And... oh!

36:42.668 --> 36:44.868
I wish to be myself.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.905
This is terrible.
Just terrible.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.473
Don't worry, Amber.

36:50.475 --> 36:52.142
We'll find a way
to stop Prisma.

36:52.144 --> 36:53.743
No, not that.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.346
This amulet doesn't have
any magic at all.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.915
Your amulet, that's
what you're worried about?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.917
Prisma's going to take
all the magic away

37:00.919 --> 37:02.852
from the isles,
and you helped her.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.555
I made an honest
mistake, Sofia.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.024
I thought Prisma
was our friend,
and so did you.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.727
I told you not to
give her the crystal,

37:10.729 --> 37:12.762
but you just had to get
a magic amulet for yourself.

37:12.764 --> 37:16.333
But that's the thing;
it isn't magical.

37:16.335 --> 37:19.002
I want to fly,
I want to grow big.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.671
See. It doesn't have
any power.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.206
My good princesses,

37:23.208 --> 37:24.841
I fear we do not have time
to waste discussing

37:24.843 --> 37:26.943
how Prisma got
her crystal back.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.012
That's right,
we need to focus
on what's important.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.114
Yes, getting it
back from her.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.882
No, getting
out of here.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.252
Sofia, the three of us
can't possibly stop Prisma.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.786
We have to try.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.788
I'm the story keeper,
and I can't leave

37:38.790 --> 37:40.790
until I give this story
a happy ending.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.759
And I say
we need a happy ending.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.928
We need to get back home
while we still can.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.931
Amber, stop thinking
only about yourself.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.233
What about all those creatures
who will lose their magic?

37:50.235 --> 37:52.969
They have those
Protectors to help them.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.639
Don't they?
Like that man we met,
the one with the wings.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.941
- You mean Orion.
- Yes.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.909
Isn't he supposed to
take care of problems like this?

37:59.911 --> 38:02.112
You're right, Amber.

38:02.114 --> 38:04.080
We have to tell Orion
that Prisma got
her Terra crystal back.

38:04.082 --> 38:06.616
And then maybe
he can help us get home.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.918
- So how can we find him?
- Through his enchantlet.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.954
- That magic bracelet?
- Yes.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.656
All Protectors
have them.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.958
It should alert Orion
whenever someone's in trouble.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.827
Help! We're
in trouble!

38:17.829 --> 38:20.897
Orion! We need you!

38:20.899 --> 38:23.066
I am normally
quite brave,

38:23.068 --> 38:25.835
but I require assistance
at this particular moment.

38:35.247 --> 38:37.914
Isn't this lovely?

38:37.916 --> 38:39.916
Far nicer than
your plain old farmhouse.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.951
Prisma, I am
begging you.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.920
Please do not harm the isles.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.022
Oh, but Azurine,

38:46.024 --> 38:47.757
I'm so happy
with my plan.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.826
<i> Crystalo!</i>

38:51.963 --> 38:55.265
There. I can see
all the Mystic Isles,

38:55.267 --> 38:57.934
each one of them
bursting with magic.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.669
Magic I can use
to grow crystals

38:59.671 --> 39:01.938
more powerful than
you ever made.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.974
But then the creatures
living there will
lose their powers.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.843
True, true.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.379
But just think how impressed
all the sorcerers will be

39:09.381 --> 39:12.148
once they see
the magic crystals I grow,

39:12.150 --> 39:17.020
starting right here
on Isle of Unicorns.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.555
No, Prisma, no.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.423
<i> Crystalo!</i>

39:24.463 --> 39:27.030
- Orion!
- Help, Orion!

39:27.032 --> 39:29.899
Uh... I feel funny.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.669
Skye, your horn.
Your wings.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.537
Am I seeing things?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.473
Or rather,
not seeing things?

39:36.475 --> 39:38.074
It must be Prisma.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.176
She's growing crystals
on your isle.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.811
Now I have lost
my wings,

39:41.813 --> 39:43.713
before I even learned
how to use them.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.316
Don't worry, we'll
stop Prisma somehow.

39:46.318 --> 39:48.184
We'll get them back.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.019
Oh!

39:50.021 --> 39:52.589
- Is that Orion?
- SKYE: I believe
it is.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.924
His enchantlet
must've alerted him
to our troubles.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.128
Oh, no!

40:03.568 --> 40:05.702
Ker-slam!
Gotcha!

40:05.704 --> 40:08.571
Oh, Harumph.
You saved him.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.273
You're a great big hero.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.575
It was easy
because he's so small.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.378
- And now I will
put him down.
- Mm-mm-mm.

40:15.380 --> 40:19.015
I mean, set him down.
Gently.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.518
There you go,
tiny Protector.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.286
It appears you were
doing the protecting

40:23.288 --> 40:25.955
this time, my friend.
I am forever grateful.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.691
You shouldn't swoosh around
up in the sky

40:28.693 --> 40:30.126
if you don't have wings.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.462
I had wings
but a moment ago.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.964
It's Prisma.
She got her
Terra crystal back,

40:34.966 --> 40:37.066
and she must've
grown crystals
on your isle.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.368
Just as I feared.

40:38.370 --> 40:40.570
But the Protectors
can stop her, right?

40:40.572 --> 40:43.640
Our only chance
is to destroy
her Terra crystal.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.376
Doing so will undo
all the damage she's caused.

40:46.378 --> 40:49.579
But... but Terra crystals
are impossible to break.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.482
No, it can be done,
with the right magic.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.551
But I must hurry and reach
the other Protectors

40:54.553 --> 40:56.453
before Prisma drains
the magic from all of us.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.122
The other Rompkins
are over there
through the woods.

40:59.124 --> 41:03.626
They have wagons that can
zoom you faster than
your teeny-tiny legs.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.595
Thank you, friend.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.931
I am indebted to you
once again.

41:07.933 --> 41:11.167
Wait, Mr. Orion.
We want to help.
What can we do?

41:11.169 --> 41:13.770
That is a brave offer
from a brave girl.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.972
But Prisma
is too powerful,

41:15.974 --> 41:17.640
even for a story keeper.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.143
That's what I've been
telling Sofia.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.311
This is a job best left

41:21.313 --> 41:23.980
for the Protectors
of the Mystic Isles.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.183
See, Sofia?

41:27.185 --> 41:28.952
The Protectors don't
even want our help.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.320
We should just go home,

41:30.322 --> 41:32.622
and stop worrying
about the Mystic Isles.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.725
I'm sure everything
will be fine from now on.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.240
She's growing
crystals here!

41:55.514 --> 41:57.981
I shall protect you,
my princesses.

41:57.983 --> 42:01.050
Uh, watch out,
queen-queen.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.135
Harumph!

42:19.137 --> 42:21.905
I'm teeny!

42:21.907 --> 42:24.207
- ( crying )
- Oh, Harumph.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.242
This isn't right.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.244
We can't let Prisma
do this to our friends.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.712
( evil laugh )

42:29.714 --> 42:31.915
Isn't that adorable?

42:31.917 --> 42:33.816
The dear girl thinks that
just because she escaped

42:33.818 --> 42:36.920
my crystal vortex,
she can somehow stop me.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.087
( giggles )

42:38.089 --> 42:40.924
She really
makes me giggle.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.525
Laugh all you want,
Prisma,

42:42.527 --> 42:44.894
but I think maybe
that girl can stop you.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.997
With what, a sister who
thinks only of herself?

42:47.999 --> 42:50.199
A unicorn
who can't fly?

42:50.201 --> 42:53.002
A giant who's
downright tiny?

42:53.004 --> 42:55.638
I almost feel sorry
for Sofia.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.180
Oh, this would've been easy

43:04.182 --> 43:07.183
back when I was
the big me.

43:07.185 --> 43:09.452
( crying )

43:11.690 --> 43:13.189
Wait, Sofia.

43:13.191 --> 43:16.192
Going back to face Prisma
is not a good idea.

43:16.194 --> 43:17.460
Amber, look at Harumph.

43:17.462 --> 43:19.529
Can't you see
how unhappy he is?

43:19.531 --> 43:21.064
Don't you wanna
help him?

43:21.066 --> 43:23.232
Of course I do.
It's just...

43:23.234 --> 43:25.301
Just what?

43:25.303 --> 43:27.971
The Rompkins made
you their queen,
and they need you.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.939
You know it's
the right thing to do.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.775
I want to help him,
to help everyone here,

43:32.777 --> 43:35.144
but Sofia...
( sighs )

43:35.146 --> 43:37.547
I'm not sure I can.

43:37.549 --> 43:40.083
I'm starting to think
there's a reason

43:40.085 --> 43:41.484
why you get to be
story keeper,

43:41.486 --> 43:43.319
and have
a special amulet,

43:43.321 --> 43:44.954
and I don't.

43:44.956 --> 43:48.758
¶ Every day I watch ¶

43:48.760 --> 43:51.828
¶ You give your all
to those in need ¶

43:51.830 --> 43:54.497
¶ Every place we go ¶

43:54.499 --> 43:58.267
¶ You make things better
with your good deeds ¶

43:58.269 --> 44:01.270
¶ You're the one
who saves the day ¶

44:01.272 --> 44:03.806
¶ Of that,
there's no doubt ¶

44:03.808 --> 44:07.510
¶ You're so strong,
a natural hero ¶

44:07.512 --> 44:13.182
¶ Inside and out ¶

44:13.184 --> 44:17.286
¶ But that's not
who I am ¶

44:17.288 --> 44:20.356
¶ Though it makes
my heart break ¶

44:20.358 --> 44:23.593
¶ That's not who I am ¶

44:23.595 --> 44:29.098
¶ I don't have
what it takes ¶

44:32.003 --> 44:35.438
¶ So today I caused ¶

44:35.440 --> 44:38.941
¶ Nothing but trouble,
can't you see ¶

44:38.943 --> 44:42.178
¶ Every place we've gone ¶

44:42.180 --> 44:45.214
¶ I've been thinking
only of me ¶

44:45.216 --> 44:48.451
¶ I'm the one
who let harm come ¶

44:48.453 --> 44:51.320
¶ To all our new friends ¶

44:51.322 --> 44:54.357
¶ I was wrong
to think that I'm brave ¶

44:54.359 --> 45:00.129
¶ It was all
just pretend ¶

45:00.131 --> 45:04.400
¶ 'Cause that's not
who I am ¶

45:04.402 --> 45:07.203
¶ Though it makes
my heart break ¶

45:07.205 --> 45:10.406
¶ That's not
who I am ¶

45:10.408 --> 45:14.077
¶ I don't have
what it takes ¶

45:14.079 --> 45:15.845
But that's
not true, Amber.

45:15.847 --> 45:18.681
There's so many times
I've seen you do
the right thing.

45:18.683 --> 45:20.083
You have?

45:20.085 --> 45:22.318
Yes. You rescued Dad
and James

45:22.320 --> 45:24.353
from the jade jaguar.

45:24.355 --> 45:27.423
You went after Mom when
you thought she was
taken by Selians.

45:27.425 --> 45:30.426
You even helped fix Clio
and Hildegard's friendship.

45:30.428 --> 45:33.229
I guess there were
times when I put
others first.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.298
Yes. You do have it
in you, Amber.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.270
¶ You're the one
I've counted on ¶

45:41.272 --> 45:44.774
¶ To stand by my side ¶

45:44.776 --> 45:49.278
¶ You're so strong,
a natural hero ¶

45:49.280 --> 45:53.449
¶ When you reach
deep inside ¶

45:53.451 --> 45:57.920
¶ 'Cause that's just
who you are ¶

45:57.922 --> 46:00.389
¶ We all make mistakes ¶

46:00.391 --> 46:04.260
¶ That's just
who you are ¶

46:04.262 --> 46:06.863
¶ You've got
what it takes ¶

46:06.865 --> 46:10.266
¶ Yes, that is
who I am ¶

46:10.268 --> 46:12.969
¶ I'll fix my mistakes ¶

46:12.971 --> 46:16.072
¶ And I'll come through ¶

46:16.074 --> 46:18.474
¶ Do all I'm meant to do ¶

46:18.476 --> 46:27.850
¶ 'Cause that is
who I am ¶

46:28.887 --> 46:30.486
So you'll stay?

46:30.488 --> 46:32.288
I will.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.157
I'm going to help
our friends.

46:34.159 --> 46:36.125
And I promise,
this time,

46:36.127 --> 46:38.728
I won't get distracted
by amulets or magical stones.

46:38.730 --> 46:41.464
Stones.
That's it, Amber.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.466
The shatter stones.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.067
From the Dancing Desert?

46:45.069 --> 46:46.769
They can shatter
anything, remember?

46:46.771 --> 46:48.571
If we get one,
we can use it

46:48.573 --> 46:50.273
to shatter Prisma's
Terra crystal.

46:50.275 --> 46:52.308
Orion said
that would stop her,

46:52.310 --> 46:53.843
and undo the damage
she's done.

46:53.845 --> 46:55.778
I would grow
big again?

46:55.780 --> 46:57.513
And I would
regain my wings.

46:57.515 --> 47:00.650
Skye, which way to
the Isle of Dancing Deserts?

47:00.652 --> 47:03.386
Ah, follow me,
my princess.

47:05.423 --> 47:08.357
Ah, that is
a clever plan.

47:08.359 --> 47:10.459
It just might work,

47:10.461 --> 47:13.696
unless a certain someone
decides to... I don't know...

47:13.698 --> 47:15.765
turn the Isle of
Dancing Deserts

47:15.767 --> 47:18.768
into my own personal
crystal farm.

47:18.770 --> 47:20.503
<i> Crystalo!</i>

47:30.448 --> 47:33.549
SOFIA: It's Prisma.
She's taking the magic
from this isle.

47:33.551 --> 47:35.351
AMBER: We're too late.

47:35.353 --> 47:38.221
Noble sands,
I beseech you.

47:38.223 --> 47:40.156
Do you have enough
magic left to tell us

47:40.158 --> 47:41.591
where the shatter stones are?

47:45.496 --> 47:47.196
Oh, it's no use.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.365
And even if we could
find the stones,

47:49.367 --> 47:51.634
the crystals probably
took their magic, too.

47:51.636 --> 47:54.136
Wait.
I just remembered.

47:54.138 --> 47:56.405
The crystals may have
drained magic from this isle,

47:56.407 --> 47:58.040
but Orion told us
the shatter stones

47:58.042 --> 48:00.643
- weren't even from here.
- Oh, that is correct.

48:00.645 --> 48:02.845
He said they were
from another isle.

48:02.847 --> 48:04.881
So maybe Prisma
hasn't gotten to

48:04.883 --> 48:06.649
the shatter stones'
home isle yet,

48:06.651 --> 48:08.851
and they still
have their magic.

48:08.853 --> 48:11.354
- We've got to find one.
- Oh, those dunes
over there.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.556
That's where I found
the stones before.

48:15.827 --> 48:18.494
- She's right, you know.
- I know, I know.

48:18.496 --> 48:19.996
I just can't remember

48:19.998 --> 48:22.465
what isle those
shatter stones came from.

48:24.269 --> 48:27.003
Was it the Isle of Miracles?

48:27.005 --> 48:28.871
No, no,
that's not it.

48:28.873 --> 48:31.774
Oh, I must stop them
from reaching those stones.

48:31.776 --> 48:33.309
<i> Crystalo!</i>

48:34.512 --> 48:36.012
We're almost there.

48:36.014 --> 48:38.214
Oh, Prisma must know
we're here.

48:38.216 --> 48:39.582
Keep running.

48:41.886 --> 48:43.853
Ka-bam!

48:43.855 --> 48:46.589
I guess being small
isn't all bad.

48:46.591 --> 48:49.358
The shatter stones
were by these dunes.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.093
I'm sure of it.

48:51.095 --> 48:53.162
Search the sand.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.465
- Sofia!
- Amber!

48:56.467 --> 48:57.900
My princess!

48:57.902 --> 49:00.436
- My queen-queen!
- Harumph!

49:00.438 --> 49:02.571
Stay close.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.473
- Sofia?
- I'm here.

49:04.475 --> 49:07.276
SKYE: We all are.

49:07.278 --> 49:08.778
Okay.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.446
( grunting )

49:10.448 --> 49:12.949
Harumph, can you
break the crystal?

49:14.585 --> 49:16.719
Break. I said break!

49:16.721 --> 49:18.721
Curses, teeny body.

49:18.723 --> 49:20.756
Stand back.
I shall use my horn

49:20.758 --> 49:22.224
to free us
from this trap.

49:22.226 --> 49:25.461
But Skye,
you don't have a horn.

49:25.463 --> 49:28.130
That might've worked better
if I still had a horn.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.466
( grunting )

49:32.303 --> 49:34.570
Oh, this is impossible.

49:34.572 --> 49:37.673
Well, that little problem
is taken care of.

49:37.675 --> 49:39.508
Back to the fun stuff,

49:39.510 --> 49:43.612
like growing crystal charms
on the Isle of Trolls.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.648
<i> Crystalo!</i>

49:45.650 --> 49:49.485
Ooh! And magic medallions
on the Isle of Witches.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.420
<i> Crystalo!</i>

49:52.657 --> 49:54.957
There must be a way.

49:54.959 --> 49:57.460
Please, girls,
find a way.

49:57.462 --> 50:01.130
( Sofia grunting )

50:01.132 --> 50:02.531
We can't get out.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.934
I won't be able to give
the story a happy ending.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.870
But Sofia,
you always find a way.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.605
Don't you?

50:09.607 --> 50:12.775
Yes, but without
a shatter stone, we're trapped.

50:12.777 --> 50:14.710
Because of me.

50:14.712 --> 50:17.713
Oh, if only I hadn't wanted
a magic amulet so badly.

50:17.715 --> 50:20.349
Now we're stuck here.

50:22.553 --> 50:25.187
Amber, this story
isn't over yet.

50:25.189 --> 50:27.656
( sighs )
Just admit it, Sofia.

50:27.658 --> 50:29.725
This story is finished.

50:29.727 --> 50:34.230
Sand, we're close to
the shatter stones, aren't we?

50:34.232 --> 50:37.733
If you have any magic left,
please show us one.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.817
I wish to be small.

51:07.165 --> 51:09.465
( banging sound )

51:12.170 --> 51:14.770
Sofia! How did you...

51:14.772 --> 51:16.439
Look what I found
in the sand.

51:16.441 --> 51:18.774
Now we can get Prisma.

51:18.776 --> 51:20.910
I told you
this story wasn't over.

51:20.912 --> 51:22.445
Way to go!

51:22.447 --> 51:23.846
What was that, sister?

51:23.848 --> 51:26.182
Do you have
something to tell me?

51:26.184 --> 51:28.951
No. I was just, uh,
admiring

51:28.953 --> 51:31.387
the beautiful
glass slippers you grew

51:31.389 --> 51:33.222
over on the Isle
of Magical Music.

51:33.224 --> 51:35.691
Can you even see those
from so far away?

51:35.693 --> 51:37.393
Yes, they're that good.

51:37.395 --> 51:39.595
I have to admit,
you truly are

51:39.597 --> 51:42.364
the most talented
crystal master.

51:42.366 --> 51:45.601
Oh, that's so sweet
of you to say.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.737
See how well we get along
when I'm in charge?

51:48.739 --> 51:50.206
Oh, and you're right.

51:50.208 --> 51:52.775
This is a particularly
gorgeous batch.

51:52.777 --> 51:54.643
Hurry, girls, hurry.

52:02.987 --> 52:04.920
It looks so different.

52:04.922 --> 52:06.555
Prisma must
be in there.

52:06.557 --> 52:08.624
But how will we get
close enough

52:08.626 --> 52:10.226
to use the shatter stone?

52:10.228 --> 52:12.728
Maybe one of you
can distract Prisma

52:12.730 --> 52:14.296
while I sneak inside.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.832
I humbly volunteer
my services, my lady.

52:16.834 --> 52:19.668
No, Skye,
I caused this mess,

52:19.670 --> 52:21.170
and I'm going
to fix it.

52:21.172 --> 52:23.572
I even have a plan.

52:31.849 --> 52:32.915
Whoa.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.822
That's a lot
of stairs.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.690
Come on.

52:41.692 --> 52:44.093
Ooh, those wizards will be
so impressed

52:44.095 --> 52:46.095
with these magic rings.

52:46.097 --> 52:47.830
I know I am.

52:50.468 --> 52:52.668
I'm going to
distract Prisma.

52:52.670 --> 52:55.804
When she's not looking,
you go get Azurine.

52:55.806 --> 52:57.740
Right.

53:02.313 --> 53:04.113
Oh, there you are.

53:04.115 --> 53:06.615
The supposedly best
crystal master in the land.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.784
Amber, how did
you get here?

53:08.786 --> 53:11.287
I have some complaints
about this amulet you made.

53:11.289 --> 53:12.721
Now's our chance.

53:12.723 --> 53:14.823
I'm going to free
Azurine.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.192
You two stay here.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.665
We cannot stand
idly by

53:22.667 --> 53:24.466
while our princesses
face danger.

53:24.468 --> 53:26.335
We must go protect them.

53:26.337 --> 53:30.773
Good idea, but shush!
Be dainty like them.

53:34.145 --> 53:36.178
Huh. I must admit,

53:36.180 --> 53:38.380
I thought if anyone
could escape my crystal trap,

53:38.382 --> 53:39.715
it would be your sister.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.817
Well, it was me.

53:41.819 --> 53:43.852
I just had to show you
that this amulet is defective.

53:43.854 --> 53:46.322
You said it would
be magical,

53:46.324 --> 53:48.090
but it doesn't
do anything.

53:48.092 --> 53:49.758
I haven't gotten
one special power.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.494
I never said I would
give you a special power.

53:52.496 --> 53:54.930
Why? Because
you can't?

53:54.932 --> 53:57.499
Oh, because you're
not talented enough?

53:57.501 --> 54:01.904
I am the most talented
crystal master there ever was.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.038
Prove it.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.541
Give this some real magic.

54:05.543 --> 54:07.409
All right then.

54:07.411 --> 54:08.744
<i> Crystalo.</i>

54:08.746 --> 54:10.846
There, now it glows.
Isn't that nice?

54:10.848 --> 54:13.215
It glows? You expect me
to be impressed

54:13.217 --> 54:15.050
with a glorified
night light?

54:15.052 --> 54:18.787
My sister's amulet
can turn her into a unicorn.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.589
Settle down.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.258
I was just
getting warmed up.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.926
<i> Crystalo!</i>

54:25.896 --> 54:28.964
There. I know how much
you care about your appearance,

54:28.966 --> 54:31.600
so now you can conjure
up a mirror whenever you like.

54:31.602 --> 54:32.901
Go on, try it.

54:32.903 --> 54:35.938
I wish for a mirror.

54:39.310 --> 54:42.544
Now are you
satisfied?

54:42.546 --> 54:45.781
Hardly. I mean,
I already carry three mirrors.

54:45.783 --> 54:48.617
Oh, maybe I should
talk to your sister
over there.

54:48.619 --> 54:50.452
I'm sure she can
do better.

54:50.454 --> 54:52.988
Don't be silly.

54:52.990 --> 54:55.224
I can do much more
than Azurine.

54:55.226 --> 54:57.726
Watch.
<i> Crystalo!</i>

55:06.671 --> 55:07.970
Princess, let me out.

55:07.972 --> 55:09.505
Okay. Get ready.

55:19.183 --> 55:20.349
What's this?

55:21.952 --> 55:23.619
It's not too late, Prisma.

55:23.621 --> 55:25.120
Hand over your Terra crystal.

55:25.122 --> 55:26.655
No, thank you.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.857
I think it's time
we finally find out

55:28.859 --> 55:32.361
which one of us
is truly the best
crystal master.

55:32.363 --> 55:35.197
¶ I have a hunch
it's me ¶

55:35.199 --> 55:36.999
<i> Crystalo!</i>

55:38.836 --> 55:40.703
<i> Crystalo!</i>

55:41.872 --> 55:44.440
That was impressive,
dear sister.

55:44.442 --> 55:46.508
Let me freeze this moment

55:46.510 --> 55:48.043
so we can
remember it forever.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.778
<i> Crystalo!</i>

55:52.616 --> 55:54.383
<i> Crystalo!</i>

55:59.657 --> 56:01.857
- You again!
- That's right.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.726
And I've got
a shatter stone.

56:03.728 --> 56:06.061
Keep that thing
away from me.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.031
<i> Crystalo!</i>

56:13.804 --> 56:15.237
That's two.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.908
<i> Crystalo!</i>

56:23.881 --> 56:25.914
- Sofia!
- The stone!

56:33.023 --> 56:34.757
Oopsies.

56:34.759 --> 56:35.991
Looks like you lost
your little rock.

56:35.993 --> 56:37.826
My hunch was right.

56:37.828 --> 56:42.664
I win at being
the best crystal master!

56:42.666 --> 56:46.034
Queen-queen, catch!

56:46.036 --> 56:47.636
What?!

56:49.740 --> 56:52.908
Oh, Amber, I'm so sorry
I have to do this.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.743
<i> Crystalo!</i>

56:54.745 --> 56:56.645
I wish for a mirror.

56:58.716 --> 57:01.250
Amber, I've already tapped
her Terra crystal twice.

57:01.252 --> 57:04.119
Just once more,
and it'll shatter.

57:05.623 --> 57:07.356
Wait, wait, wait.

57:07.358 --> 57:08.424
If I lose my magic,

57:08.426 --> 57:10.058
you'll lose yours.

57:10.060 --> 57:11.026
What do you mean?

57:11.028 --> 57:13.395
If you smash
my Terra crystal,

57:13.397 --> 57:16.198
everything I've created
with it will disappear,

57:16.200 --> 57:19.601
and that includes
your amulet.

57:19.603 --> 57:21.970
It has even more magic
than your sister's.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.405
Don't listen to her, Amber.

57:23.407 --> 57:25.607
Think of the Rompkins,
the unicorns,

57:25.609 --> 57:27.810
all our friends
in the Mystic Isles.

57:27.812 --> 57:31.613
Our sisters are
always telling us to
think of others first.

57:31.615 --> 57:33.315
But what about what we want?

57:33.317 --> 57:34.950
Shouldn't that matter?

57:34.952 --> 57:37.453
Now give me
the shatter stone, Amber.

57:40.791 --> 57:43.058
Okay, I'll give it to you.

57:56.006 --> 57:59.174
No! My beautiful
crystals.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.410
My wings!

58:02.346 --> 58:06.081
Boom! I'm big me again.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.617
This can't
be happening.

58:08.619 --> 58:10.319
It should not
have come to this, sister.

58:10.321 --> 58:13.288
But now, I must take you
to the Protectors.

58:13.290 --> 58:14.923
Azurine, please.

58:14.925 --> 58:16.091
I'm sorry, Prisma.

58:16.093 --> 58:19.094
No. I got away
from you once before,

58:19.096 --> 58:20.696
and I can do it again.

58:25.035 --> 58:28.770
- After her, Skye!
- Cling tight, my princess.

58:39.650 --> 58:41.450
Faster, Skye, faster!

58:41.452 --> 58:43.285
We are gaining on
the evil-doer.

58:44.855 --> 58:47.189
Not only that, Skye,
you're flying.

58:47.191 --> 58:50.025
What? The ground is
no longer touching my hooves.

58:50.027 --> 58:52.628
I am.
I'm flying!

58:52.630 --> 58:56.198
Look at me, look at me,
I'm flying!

58:56.200 --> 58:57.900
And not only that,

58:57.902 --> 58:59.535
we have caught up
to the evil-doer.

59:00.804 --> 59:02.704
Hold on, my princess.

59:09.079 --> 59:12.080
Halt, in the name
of the Protectors.

59:12.082 --> 59:14.316
No!

59:31.101 --> 59:34.002
My princess,
I must inform you
that we are not alone.

59:36.373 --> 59:38.340
SOFIA:
It's Orion.

59:38.342 --> 59:39.808
SKYE:
And the Protectors.

59:41.378 --> 59:43.579
Greetings,
Princess Sofia.

59:43.581 --> 59:45.180
Excellent work.

59:45.182 --> 59:46.915
We will take custody
of your prisoner now.

59:46.917 --> 59:48.550
Prisoner?!

59:48.552 --> 59:50.886
I am nobody's
prisoner.

59:50.888 --> 59:53.789
I am the greatest
crystal master
that ever lived.

59:53.791 --> 59:55.390
That's debatable.

59:55.392 --> 59:57.693
But what is certain
is you will never again

59:57.695 --> 59:59.828
harm the Mystic Isles.
Take her away.

1:00:01.565 --> 1:00:03.298
Let go of me!

1:00:11.241 --> 1:00:14.142
This is all
your fault, princess,

1:00:14.144 --> 1:00:17.045
and don't think
I won't remember.

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:27.923
Sofia, your time
as story keeper

1:00:27.925 --> 1:00:30.125
has taught you much.

1:00:30.127 --> 1:00:33.261
Yes, we all witnessed
your capture of
the crystal master.

1:00:33.263 --> 1:00:35.230
Very impressive.

1:00:35.232 --> 1:00:38.500
Well, I couldn't let her harm
all the good creatures here.

1:00:38.502 --> 1:00:41.937
Princess Sofia, because of
your selfless actions,

1:00:41.939 --> 1:00:44.740
and the skill you have
demonstrated here today,

1:00:44.742 --> 1:00:46.908
we would like
to invite you

1:00:46.910 --> 1:00:48.243
to join our ranks,

1:00:48.245 --> 1:00:50.145
and become
a Protector.

1:00:50.147 --> 1:00:52.280
- Me?
- Huh?

1:00:52.282 --> 1:00:54.650
A non-magical creature
has never been a Protector.

1:00:54.652 --> 1:00:58.987
That is precisely why
we are interested in
this brave girl.

1:00:58.989 --> 1:01:01.156
We have long searched
for a Protector

1:01:01.158 --> 1:01:03.191
who could help us
with problems that arise

1:01:03.193 --> 1:01:04.626
outside of
the Mystic Isles.

1:01:04.628 --> 1:01:07.095
So you're saying I could
become a Protector

1:01:07.097 --> 1:01:09.197
back home in
Enchancia?

1:01:09.199 --> 1:01:12.367
Yes. The Protector
of the ever realm.

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:14.169
That is,
if you accept.

1:01:16.206 --> 1:01:18.173
It would be my honor.

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:20.342
Good. Now return
to your kingdom.

1:01:20.344 --> 1:01:23.145
When the time is right,
we will begin your training.

1:01:23.147 --> 1:01:25.347
ORION: There will be
much for you to do,

1:01:25.349 --> 1:01:26.815
and to learn.

1:01:26.817 --> 1:01:28.350
I can't wait.

1:01:28.352 --> 1:01:30.619
Thank you, Mr. Orion.

1:01:34.958 --> 1:01:37.359
Congratulations,
my princess.

1:01:37.361 --> 1:01:41.329
I suggest we celebrate
with some loop-de-loops.

1:01:41.331 --> 1:01:43.398
Whoo hoo!

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:49.204
You're going to be
a Protector?

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:51.840
Oh, I'm so happy
for you, Sofia.

1:01:51.842 --> 1:01:54.176
And for them.
They're lucky to have you.

1:01:54.178 --> 1:01:56.011
I'm proud of you.

1:01:56.013 --> 1:01:58.180
I know it wasn't easy,
giving up your amulet.

1:01:58.182 --> 1:02:00.315
The strange thing is,
it was easy.

1:02:00.317 --> 1:02:02.417
I don't miss it,

1:02:02.419 --> 1:02:04.586
not the way Harumph
would've missed being a Rompkin,

1:02:04.588 --> 1:02:06.655
or Skye would've missed
his wings.

1:02:06.657 --> 1:02:08.690
I know you
had it in you, Amber.

1:02:08.692 --> 1:02:11.426
Now I know it, too.
Thanks, Sofia.

1:02:11.428 --> 1:02:13.595
Drip-drop.

1:02:13.597 --> 1:02:16.398
Those are
my tears falling,

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.233
because I will miss you.

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:20.569
Oh, me, too, Harumph.

1:02:20.571 --> 1:02:23.105
I suppose I have to
give this back,

1:02:23.107 --> 1:02:24.906
since I'm leaving and all.

1:02:24.908 --> 1:02:27.042
No, keep the crown.

1:02:27.044 --> 1:02:30.112
You will always be
my queen-queen.

1:02:30.114 --> 1:02:32.848
And my friend.

1:02:32.850 --> 1:02:35.984
Crack.
That's my heart breaking.

1:02:39.690 --> 1:02:41.523
For my queen.

1:02:44.728 --> 1:02:46.795
Skye, can you
lead the way home?

1:02:46.797 --> 1:02:49.598
Most assuredly.
But if you do not mind,

1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:52.467
I prefer to do it
airborne!

1:02:52.469 --> 1:02:54.069
This way,
my princesses.

1:02:54.071 --> 1:02:55.570
AMBER: Can we take
the scenic route?

1:02:55.572 --> 1:02:57.272
Splendid idea.

1:02:57.274 --> 1:02:59.107
We can stop by
the Isle of Fairies.

1:02:59.109 --> 1:03:01.576
Ooh, ooh,
and the Isle of Wishes.

1:03:01.578 --> 1:03:05.213
And I must show you
the Isle of Mermaids!
