WEBVTT

00:09.243 --> 00:10.511
SO LAME.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.646
ALL ANYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
IS THIS ELECTION.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.349
IT'S RUINING TWITTER.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.017
MANDY, YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.586
THIS WILL BE
YOUR FIRST TIME VOTING.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.388
I BELIEVE I SPEAK
FOR ALL OF AMERICA

00:20.421 --> 00:22.956
WHEN I SAY,
LET HER SIT THIS ONE OUT.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.895
SO, I ASSUME YOU'RE GONNA BE
VOTING FOR THE PRESIDENT?

00:27.928 --> 00:30.331
UM, EVERYONE'S VOTING
FOR THE PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

00:30.364 --> 00:32.500
AND A BUNCH OF LAWS
AND STUFF.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.536
I MEAN, ARE YOU VOTING
FOR OBAMA?

00:35.569 --> 00:38.339
OH. I DON'T KNOW, KRIS.
MOM, WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?

00:38.372 --> 00:39.673
I AM NOT TELLING.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.110
THAT HAS BEEN MY POLICY
SINCE BUSH/DUKAKIS.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.944
(stifles laugh)

00:43.977 --> 00:46.714
WHAT'S A DUKAKIS?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.251
A SMALL GREEK MAN
FROM MASSACHUSETTS

00:50.284 --> 00:51.885
WHO CLIMBED INTO A TANK
ONE DAY

00:51.919 --> 00:54.355
AND DISAPPEARED FOREVER.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.924
HEY, YOUR FATHER
WAS NOT A FAN.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.692
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
AGREE WITH DAD ON THIS ONE.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.629
NO GOVERNOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS
SHOULD EVER BECOME PRESIDENT.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.131
HEY, HEY, HEY!

01:03.164 --> 01:05.933
THE SECRET BALLOT IS
A CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY,

01:05.966 --> 01:07.968
AND HAVING A FEW SECRETS
FROM YOUR FATHER

01:08.001 --> 01:09.470
IS THE CORNERSTONE
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.139
(laughs)
(door opens)

01:11.172 --> 01:14.608
SO... LET'S KEEP THE PEACE
BY KEEPING THIS ZIPPED...

01:14.642 --> 01:17.145
OH...
AND THIS, TOO.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.647
COME ON. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
DAD LOVES A GOOD ARGUMENT.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.250
YEAH, AND SO DO I,
UNLESS IT LASTS FOR THREE HOURS

01:22.283 --> 01:24.952
AND FOCUSES MAINLY
ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.387
(Mike) WHEW!

01:26.420 --> 01:29.457
BOY, SOME BIG DOG
DUMPED SOMETHING ON OUR LAWN.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.226
WHEW!

01:32.260 --> 01:33.994
YOU MEAN SOMEBODY PUT A SIGN
WITH THE NAME OF OUR PRESIDENT

01:34.027 --> 01:35.829
ON THE LAWN?
WHO COULD THAT HAVE BEEN?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.232
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.500
YOU DON'T MOW THE LAWN,

01:39.533 --> 01:41.735
AND NOW SHE'S ACTIVELY
DEFACING IT.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.804
WE'RE HAVING A NICE
TRI-TIP TONIGHT.
WHAT--

01:43.837 --> 01:46.174
EVERYBODY LIKE THAT?
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
OH! MM, YEAH.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.176
OKAY, THERE ARE, LIKE, A MILLION
ROMNEY SIGNS OUT THERE.
(Mike groans)

01:48.209 --> 01:49.910
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT LIKES THINGS,

01:49.943 --> 01:51.345
YOU KNOW,
FAIR AND BALANCED.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.147
YOU WANNA START
THIS UP--
GOES GREAT WITH CHIMICHURRI.

01:53.181 --> 01:56.684
I LOVE CHIMICHURRI SAUCE.
THAT'LL BE GOOD ON THERE.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.852
I THOUGHT YOU VOTED REPUBLICAN
LAST TIME.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.521
OH, YEAH, I KNOW YOU--
YOU THOUGHT THAT.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.122
I JUST--I JUST COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO VOTE

02:02.156 --> 02:05.493
FOR A WOMAN WHO LIKES TO SHOOT
WOLVES FROM A HELICOPTER.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.329
SO YOU VOTE FOR A-A GUY
FROM KENYA INSTEAD?

02:08.362 --> 02:11.165
YOU'VE GOT IT MIXED UP, OKAY?
OBAMA WAS NOT BORN OVERSEAS.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.834
OVERSEAS IS WHERE ROMNEY
LIKES TO HIDE HIS MONEY.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.135
OHH...

02:15.169 --> 02:17.538
(mouth full) OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS SO BORING!

02:17.571 --> 02:19.507
WAIT, WAIT.
WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN

02:19.540 --> 02:21.342
TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE YET.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.444
OH, DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON THIS.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.113
YOU KNOW, AARON BURR SHOT
ALEXANDER HAMILTON

02:26.146 --> 02:28.782
TEN YEARS TOO LATE
IN MY BOOK.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.051
MOMMY!
WHOA!

02:31.084 --> 02:32.686
(laughs) THERE'S
MY LITTLE MAN. MMM!

02:32.720 --> 02:34.222
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT
AT YOUR DAD'S?

02:34.255 --> 02:37.558
DADDY'S BED COMES
RIGHT OUT OF THE COUCH!
(Mike laughs)

02:37.591 --> 02:39.627
(Mike) WELL, GREAT.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.196
SEAMLESS TRANSITION FROM
SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING

02:42.230 --> 02:44.064
TO... LAYING AROUND
DOING NOTHING.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.700
DAD.
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD EVER
SINCE I GOT BACK TO DENVER.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.669
I'VE BEEN AT THE ICE FACTORY
SIX MONTHS NOW.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.671
YOU WORK
AT AN ICE FACTORY.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.674
WOW. YOU KNOW WHO COULD
DO YOUR JOB BETTER?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.843
JANUARY.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.678
WOW.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.480
HEY, COOL OBAMA SIGN, MIKE.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.181
GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE COMING AROUND.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.583
I'M NOT COMING AROUND.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.052
I YANKED THAT OUT OF MY YARD
SO I COULD THROW IT OUT,

03:05.085 --> 03:07.321
MAKE ROOM
FOR MY ROMNEY SIGNS.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.590
OH, YEAH, I SAW THOSE OUT THERE,
JUST FLOPPING AROUND

03:09.623 --> 03:11.725
WHICHEVER WAY THE WIND BLOWS.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.327
(mouths words)

03:13.361 --> 03:15.763
YOU KNOW, ROMNEY IS A DOER.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.198
IT'S EASY TO BE CONSISTENT
LIKE OBAMA

03:18.232 --> 03:21.735
WHEN ALL YOU'VE EVER DONE
IS "ORGANIZE COMMUNITIES."

03:21.769 --> 03:24.772
HE DID A GREAT JOB WITH THAT
SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO,

03:24.805 --> 03:25.939
BOY, DIDN'T HE?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.575
IT RUNS LIKE A WATCH DOWN THERE.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.943
YOU CAN'T WEAR ONE, YOU KNOW?

03:29.977 --> 03:32.946
(chuckles)
HONEY, BACK ME UP ON THIS.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.949
YEAH, THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES
CALL FOR A GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.385
THERE YOU, GO.
THANKS, HONEY.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.686
OF COURSE,
IT'S THE BUSINESSMEN

03:38.719 --> 03:40.954
WHO GOT US INTO
THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.091
WHERE DOES SHE STAND?

03:44.124 --> 03:47.561
(singsongy) NOBODY KNOWS!

03:47.595 --> 03:49.096
HMM. FLIP-FLOPPING.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.465
SOUNDS JUST LIKE
YOUR CANDIDATE, DAD.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.866
YEAH, LIKE YOUR CANDIDATE,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.536
SHE THINKS IT'S GOOD
TO FEED FREELOADERS.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.939
THAT SOUNDED LIKE
A DINNER INVITATION TO ME.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.486
(scoffs)
FANTASY FOOTBALL TIME?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.288
YEAH. TODAY'S
THE TRADING DEADLINE.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.989
PEOPLE ARE MAKING MOVES
LIKE CRAZY.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.326
GROWN MEN PLAYING
FAIRY TALE FOOTBALL.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.661
WE GOT A FANTASY TEAM
OF EMPLOYEES,

04:20.694 --> 04:22.896
AND NONE OF YOU ARE ON IT!

04:22.930 --> 04:24.598
CLOSE UP THE COMPUTERS!

04:24.632 --> 04:26.634
YOU'VE GOTTA GO TO WORK.
CLOSE 'EM UP!

04:28.936 --> 04:31.372
(opens and closes door)

04:35.008 --> 04:36.610
(Ed) RIGHT. YEAH...
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH

04:36.644 --> 04:37.978
THEY'RE INTO THAT
FANTASY FOOTBALL.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.947
SHH! SO WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU FOUND OUT

04:39.980 --> 04:41.081
MY QUARTERBACK IS INJURED,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.183
AND YOU CALLED JUST TO GLOAT.
IS THAT IT?

04:43.216 --> 04:44.985
(chuckles)

04:45.018 --> 04:47.355
YEAH, WELL, I PLAN
ON WINNING THIS THING,

04:47.388 --> 04:48.956
AND I WILL NOT LOSE AGAIN

04:48.989 --> 04:51.859
TO A COLD, BLACK-HEARTED SHARK
LIKE YOU!

04:51.892 --> 04:52.926
(sighs)

04:52.960 --> 04:55.228
YOUR DAUGHTER EVE SAYS HELLO.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.599
THAT WAS EVE ON THE PHONE?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.167
SHE'S WON THREE YEARS
IN A ROW.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.636
I HAVE A PLAN TO BRING DOWN
THAT SHE-DEVIL.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.838
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M SORRY.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.375
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.343
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT THIS
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE ELECTION?

05:09.377 --> 05:11.945
I DON'T VOTE ANYMORE.
THEY JUST BREAK MY HEART.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.146
LIKE NIXON!

05:15.215 --> 05:16.650
THE MAN WAS A GIANT,

05:16.684 --> 05:19.186
AND HE QUIT WITHOUT EVEN
PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.491
SO--SO YOU'RE GOOD
WITH FOUR MORE YEARS

05:23.524 --> 05:25.659
OF BIG GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS?

05:25.693 --> 05:28.862
AND A FIRST LADY WHO DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN SLEEVES?

05:28.896 --> 05:31.865
WELL, WITH GUNS LIKE THAT,
WHO CAN BLAME HER?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.333
(chuckles) YEAH.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.468
HEY.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.969
HEY.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.138
MITT NEEDS YOUR HELP.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.807
CAN ONE OF THE OTHER GUYS
HELP HIM?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.075
MR. ALZATE TEXTED
HE WANTED TO SEE ME.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.317
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
AH, THANKS FOR COMING.
YEAH.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.686
SO, ONCE AGAIN,
THE FOOTBALL GODS

05:52.720 --> 05:54.722
HAVE BEEN UNKIND TO YOU,
HUH?
I KNOW.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.490
I'VE HAD A ROUGH YEAR.
YEAH.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.859
MY STRATEGY OF NOT DRAFTING
ANYONE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD

05:58.892 --> 06:00.594
SEEMS TO HAVE BACKFIRED.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.696
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO FIGURE THAT STUFF OUT.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.232
WELL, I HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING
THIS YEAR, ALL RIGHT?

06:05.265 --> 06:06.767
I WANT YOU TO TRADE ME
YOUR QUARTERBACK.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.669
I WANT AARON RODGERS.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.671
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR

06:10.704 --> 06:12.706
TO THE REST OF THE LEAGUE
IF I GAVE YOU RODGERS.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.442
AND BESIDES,
HE'S THE HEART AND SOUL

06:14.475 --> 06:16.744
OF MY LOCKER ROOM, AND HE WORKS
WITH UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS...

06:16.777 --> 06:19.379
AH.
IN MY FANTASY COMMUNITY.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.016
I LIVE ALONE.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.786
YEAH. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.187
YOU KEEP RODGERS.
OKAY.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.622
GO AHEAD. (chuckles)

06:28.656 --> 06:31.925
AND, KYLE, COULD YOU SWEEP
THE PARKING LOT TODAY?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.429
ALL RIGHT.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.030
UH, BUT IS THIS JUST
A COINCIDENCE,

06:37.064 --> 06:38.365
OR ARE YOU PUNISHING ME

06:38.398 --> 06:39.767
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
MAKE THIS TRADE?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.569
I WOULDN'T PUNISH YOU, SON.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.871
YOU HAVE PRINCIPLES,
AND I RESPECT THAT.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.106
NOW GRAB A BROOM...

06:46.139 --> 06:48.776
AND THE BEAR COSTUME.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.386
ED'S PRESSURING KYLE
TO TRADE HIM AARON RODGERS.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.755
EXCUSE ME?
FOR HIS FANTASY TEAM.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.457
YOU WORK WITH THE GUY,
AND I GET NO INTEL ON THIS?

07:03.491 --> 07:06.159
WHAT'S THE POINT OF SENDING YOU
TO THAT OFFICE EVERY DAY?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.597
THERE'S THINGS GOING ON
IN THIS COUNTRY

07:09.630 --> 07:10.964
THAT WILL CHANGE THE COURSE
OF HUMAN--

07:10.998 --> 07:12.332
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.101
OH, YES!

07:14.134 --> 07:16.236
(singsongy) I JUST GOT
DARREN McFADDEN!

07:16.269 --> 07:19.473
(groans)
OH, OH, OH, YEAH!

07:19.507 --> 07:22.342
YEAH! ED CAN HAVE
AARON RODGERS NOW, MAN!

07:22.375 --> 07:23.844
THIS IS HUGE!

07:23.877 --> 07:24.978
WHOO!

07:27.047 --> 07:28.482
DID YOU JUST MENTION
AN OAKLAND RAIDER

07:28.516 --> 07:30.083
IN A DENVER BRONCO
HOUSEHOLD?
(sighs)

07:30.117 --> 07:32.085
(normal voice) McFADDEN'S NOT
JUST A RAIDER ANYMORE, DAD.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.022
HE'S A RAIDER. HE--
HE'S THE NEW STARTING TAILBACK
ON MY FANTASY TEAM,

07:35.055 --> 07:38.659
THE THREE FACES OF EVE.
YEAH, BABY!

07:38.692 --> 07:42.830
AND ALL THREE OF THOSE FACES
ARE SAYING, "SUCK IT, ED!"

07:42.863 --> 07:46.600
LISTEN. THE RAIDERS ARE
SWORN ENEMIES OF THE BRONCOS.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.168
IT'S LIKE THE CRIPS
AND THE BLOODS,

07:48.201 --> 07:50.470
BOTH OF WHOM
ARE RAIDERS FANS.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.472
SORRY, DAD.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.508
BUT AS THE GREAT AL DAVIS
SAID,

07:54.542 --> 07:56.043
"JUST WIN, BABY!"

07:56.076 --> 07:59.947
THAT'S ANOTHER NAME WE DON'T
SAY IN A BRONCO HOUSE!

08:09.022 --> 08:11.391
BOYD, HURRY UP!
YOUR DAD'S WAITING!

08:11.424 --> 08:15.462
(Boyd) I HAVE TO GET THAT
BORING TOY DADDY GAVE ME!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.364
YOU TOLD ME
I HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT

08:17.397 --> 08:20.400
SO HE WON'T FEEL BAD!

08:20.433 --> 08:23.904
MANDY, HONEY,
I FOUND THIS VOTER'S GUIDE

08:23.937 --> 08:25.839
SO YOU CAN STUDY
FOR THE ELECTION.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.407
STUDY? MOM, HOW HARD
CAN IT BE?

08:27.440 --> 08:31.411
NANA VOTES, AND SHE TRIED TO
BUY OUR GROCERIES WITH BUTTONS.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.413
MANDY, IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO BE INFORMED

08:33.446 --> 08:35.515
ABOUT THE ISSUES BEFORE
YOU STEP INTO THAT BOOTH

08:35.549 --> 08:37.150
AND PULL THE CURTAIN.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT, MANDY.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.819
IT'S JUST LIKE
A DRESSING ROOM.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.990
EXCEPT--MANDY, HONEY, LOOK.
TH-THIS IS IMPORTANT.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.425
DON'T TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.929
THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD ADVICE.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.363
LISTEN, I MADE YOU A LIST

08:50.397 --> 08:52.065
OF EVERYTHING
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR

08:52.099 --> 08:53.601
AND EVERYBO YOU SHOULD
VOTE FOR.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.268
COOL, A CHEAT SHEET!

08:55.302 --> 08:58.171
AND I DON'T MIND IF YOUR
FRIENDS COPY OFF OF THAT.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.041
YOU CAN'T JUST TELL HER
HOW TO VOTE, DAD.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.076
I KNOW.
SHE WON'T REMEMBER.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.580
THAT'S WHY I PRINTED IT OUT.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.718
(laughs) OH! SWEET!
THEY WANT TO LEGALIZE WEED?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.119
(laughs)
(forced laugh)

09:12.152 --> 09:15.388
BUT THEY STILL CAN'T
GET ME TO TRY IT.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.526
SO, WAIT, WHY DO I LIKE
ROMNEY AGAIN?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.529
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
HE DOESN'T SMOKE WEED.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.598
OR CIGARETTES
OR DRINK BOOZE.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.933
AND IF YOU CUT HIM,

09:25.966 --> 09:29.703
SOME SORT OF HYDRAULIC FLUID
LEAKS OUT.

09:29.737 --> 09:33.373
(laughing)

09:33.406 --> 09:35.776
BUT AT LEAST
HE'LL BE SOBER ENOUGH

09:35.809 --> 09:37.377
TO REIGN IN
THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.311
HMM. HALLELUJAH.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.248
OBAMA RESPECTS
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.683
HALLELUJAH!

09:44.284 --> 09:47.387
HOW LONG CAN SHE
KEEP DOING THIS?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.323
NOBODY KNOWS.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.325
ALL RIGHT. LET ME
PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE

09:52.359 --> 09:54.061
WITH THE INHERITANCE TAX.
(mutters)

09:54.094 --> 09:55.996
NOW, ONE DAY,
I AM GONNA DIE,

09:56.029 --> 09:57.798
AND I'LL SPLIT THINGS UP
AND GIVE IT YOU GUYS, RIGHT?

09:57.831 --> 10:00.333
I CALL THE MONEY
AND THE HOUSE!

10:01.534 --> 10:04.805
(gasps) OH,
AND I'LL MISS YOU, DAD.

10:06.674 --> 10:10.510
ANYHOW, THE DEMOCRATS
WILL TAX THAT INHERITANCE

10:10.543 --> 10:13.280
AND PROBABLY USE THAT MONEY
TO THROW GAY WEDDINGS

10:13.313 --> 10:15.182
FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.286
(mouths words)
BUT... THAT'S NOT FAIR.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.288
WE WORKED REALLY HARD
FOR THAT MONEY.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.157
YES, WE DID.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.359
BUT IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN...
MM-HMM?

10:26.393 --> 10:30.197
THE ONLY THING YOU'LL INHERIT
IS A $16 TRILLION DEBT.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.833
WAIT, YOU MEAN THE DEBT
THAT WE GOT FROM BUSH

10:32.866 --> 10:34.702
CUTTING TAXES
ON BILLIONAIRES,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.136
AND, OH, TWO UNPAID-FOR WARS?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.871
LISTEN. YOU KNOW,
YOUR MOUTH OPENS,

10:37.905 --> 10:40.573
BUT BILL MAHER'S VOICE
COMES OUT.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.111
WE NEED SOMEBODY
IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO'S TOUGH

10:44.144 --> 10:45.645
SO HE CAN MAKE
TOUGH DECISIONS.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.214
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHO'S TOUGH?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.349
THAT GUY WHO KILLED
BIN LADEN.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.051
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE ALL YOUR GUY
TRIED TO KILL

10:51.084 --> 10:53.153
WAS THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY.
UH-HUH.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.525
DEMOCRATS...
MM.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.328
LOVE SPENDING
OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.865
LIKE FREE HEALTH CARE
FOR EVERYBODY--WHOOPEE!

11:06.599 --> 11:09.402
NOW LAZY PEOPLE CAN JUST
GO AROUND LICKING DOORKNOBS.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.140
MIKE, JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE

11:13.173 --> 11:14.708
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU'RE LAZY.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.676
MEDICAL CARE SHOULD BE
A BASIC RIGHT.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.178
YEAH, YOU WERE BORN,
YOU DID YOUR JOB,

11:18.211 --> 11:19.713
NOW IT'S UP TO THE REST OF US
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU?

11:19.747 --> 11:21.481
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A RICH GUY, MAN,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.350
SO MAYBE ROMNEY MAKES SENSE
FOR YOU.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.719
BUT OBAMA IS LOOKING OUT
FOR WORKING PEOPLE.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.020
HE'S GOT TO LOOK OUT
FOR 'EM,

11:27.054 --> 11:29.389
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND!

11:29.422 --> 11:30.924
WHERE ARE THE WORKING PEOPLE?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.826
THEY'RE ALL IN MEXICO
GETTING JOBS!

11:32.860 --> 11:35.228
HE'S GOT MEXICANS
GOING BACK TO MEXICO!

11:35.262 --> 11:38.698
(Kristin) BOYD!

11:38.732 --> 11:40.934
DADDY, I LOVE MY ABACUS.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.736
EVERY TIME I PLAY WITH IT...

11:42.770 --> 11:45.038
I LEARN.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.940
I LOVE YOU. MWAH!
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.743
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT, MIKE.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.745
HEY, BOYD, WHY DON'T YOU
USE YOUR ABACUS

11:51.779 --> 11:53.546
TO TEACH YOUR DAD
ABOUT THE DEFICIT?

11:53.580 --> 11:57.384
THOSE LITTLE RED BEADS--
THEY'RE TRILLIONS!

11:57.417 --> 11:59.086
YOU KNOW, DAD, I REALLY WISH

11:59.119 --> 12:00.854
YOU HADN'T LAID
INTO RYAN LIKE THAT.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.355
HE JUST LOST HIS JOB.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.124
LOST HIS JOB
AT AN ICE FACTORY?

12:04.157 --> 12:07.995
WHAT, DID SOMEBODY LEAK
THE SECRET RECIPE?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.898
AND WHEN RYAN LOST HIS JOB,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.732
BOYD LOST
HIS HEALTH INSURANCE.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.968
YOU SEE, MANDY, THIS IS WHAT
OBAMA IS TRYING TO FIX.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.703
LISTEN, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
GOES WRONG WITH BOYD,

12:16.736 --> 12:17.805
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.872
FAMILIES TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.073
I DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT

12:20.107 --> 12:21.474
STICKING ITS FAT NOSE
IN EVERYTHING.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.876
OKAY, THEN WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE OTHER 5-YEAR-OLDS

12:22.910 --> 12:25.212
THAT DON'T HAVE
NICE, GENEROUS GRANDFATHERS?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.080
(door opens)

12:28.515 --> 12:30.918
(clicks tongue)
WAIT A MINUTE. (sighs)

12:30.951 --> 12:34.087
I CAN'T READ THIS.
THIS THING IS IN SPANISH.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.136
GRACIAS. (laughs)

12:54.041 --> 12:57.410
I CAN HEAR YOU GRINDING
YOUR TEETH OVER THERE.
(groans)

12:57.444 --> 13:00.981
OBAMA?
NO. McFADDEN.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.652
THE "DON'T WORRY,
BE HAPPY" GUY?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.787
THAT'S McFERRIN.
OH.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.790
NO, McFADDEN.
HE'S AN OAKLAND RAIDER.
YEAH. MM. MM-HMM.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.792
EVE PICKED HIM
FOR HER FANTASY TEAM,

13:12.826 --> 13:15.829
AND NOW I'VE GOT
A RAIDER IN THE HOUSE

13:15.863 --> 13:18.031
AND A TRAITOR IN THE HOUSE.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.801
WAIT. SO--SO YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT FANTASY FOOTBALL?

13:21.835 --> 13:24.271
AND KRISTIN
AND THE ELECTION.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.339
AHH! I KNEW IT!

13:26.373 --> 13:27.707
DON'T TURN ON THE LIGHT.
WAIT--
(switch clicks)

13:27.740 --> 13:29.109
OH!
SORRY.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.011
YOU KNOW, IF I LOSE MANDY,

13:31.044 --> 13:34.014
I'VE LOST ALL THREE
OF MY DAUGHTERS IN ONE WEEK.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.648
YOU'RE NOT LOSING THEM.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.784
THEY'RE JUST DEVELOPING
THEIR OWN IDEAS.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.787
I KNOW.
WHAT DID WE DO WRONG?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.522
(Mike sighs)

13:42.555 --> 13:44.624
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.627
THEY'RE BECOMING STRONG,
INDEPENDENT-MINDED WOMEN.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.897
YOU KNOW, THE FOUNDING FATHERS
KNEW IT TOOK

13:49.930 --> 13:52.132
EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM
TO VOTE.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.467
THAT'S WHY ONLY LANDOWNERS
COULD VOTE.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.070
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I THINK THAT'S REALLY SMART.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.040
YOU MEAN MEN. WHITE MEN.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.175
YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT MAKES YOU SICK.
OH.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.544
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, YOU MARRIED ONE.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.679
(switch clicks)
SO, ARE YOU HONESTLY SAYING
THAT YOU THINK

14:06.713 --> 14:08.882
THINGS WERE BETTER
WHEN THERE WAS SLAVERY

14:08.916 --> 14:10.017
AND WOMEN COULDN'T VOTE?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.053
NO! SLAVERY WAS HORRIBLE.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.728
AND?

14:21.761 --> 14:23.363
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.839
("Hail to the Chief" playing)
HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.875
THIS CHAIR IS MINE.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.280
HI. MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.683
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE,
AS PROPERTY TAXES GO UP,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.786
RESPECT FOR THE LANDOWNER
GOES DOWN.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.789
WE USED TO LISTEN TO GUYS
LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON,

14:49.822 --> 14:51.091
THOMAS JEFFERSON.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.026
WE KNEW THEY CARED
ABOUT THIS COUNTRY

14:53.060 --> 14:55.562
BECAUSE THEY OWNED IT.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.797
WE DIDN'T CALL THEM
THE FOUNDERS.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.134
WE CALL THEM
THE FOUNDING FATHERS.

15:01.168 --> 15:05.138
BECAUSE WE RESPECTED FATHERS.
NOW NOBODY LISTENS TO FATHERS.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.408
EXCEPT HERE AT OUTDOOR MAN.
WE LISTEN TO YOU FATHERS.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.443
YOU BRING ME
YOUR PROPERTY TAX BILL

15:10.477 --> 15:13.413
AND PROOF
OF AN UNGRATEFUL CHILD,

15:13.446 --> 15:15.448
AND WE'LL TREAT YOU
LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.485
(chuckles)
OR BETTER YET, HOW THE MEDIA
TREATS THE PRESIDENT--

15:18.518 --> 15:22.622
WITH KID GLOVES,
ALL PUCKERED UP.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.791
(chuckles)

15:29.296 --> 15:31.498
I AGREE WITH YOUR VLOG,
MR. B.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.001
THOSE FOUNDING FATHERS
WERE TOTALLY AWESOME DUDES.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.735
WELL, THEY DON'T CARVE
A DUDE'S HEAD

15:35.768 --> 15:39.272
IN THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN UNLESS
HE'S TOTALLY AWESOME, KYLE.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.807
YOUR VLOG MAKES ME WONDER
IF GEORGE WASHINGTON

15:40.840 --> 15:42.475
WOULD HAVE TRADED
AARON RODGERS

15:42.509 --> 15:44.511
JUST BECAUSE HIS BOSS
MADE HIM

15:44.544 --> 15:46.179
CRAWL ALONG
THE WAREHOUSE RAFTERS

15:46.213 --> 15:49.149
TRYING TO CATCH PIGEONS
IN A BEAR SUIT.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.619
YOU ASK THE BIG
POLITICAL QUESTIONS, KYLE.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.287
YOU KNOW, I BET YOU
BEN FRANKLIN

15:54.321 --> 15:55.622
WOULDN'T HAVE TRADED
RODGERS, EITHER--

15:55.655 --> 15:58.325
EVEN IF, YOU KNOW, AFTER
HE DIDN'T CATCH THE PIGEONS,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.760
HE WAS FORCED TO CLEAN UP
THEIR DROPPINGS...

16:00.793 --> 16:03.030
IN A BEAR SUIT.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.265
AS IT TURNS OUT,
FRANKLIN HAD A HIGH TOLERANCE

16:05.298 --> 16:06.433
FOR THE DISGUSTING.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.569
HE, UH, SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH THE FRENCH.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.206
I ADMIRE YOU
AND THE FOUNDING FATHERS

16:13.240 --> 16:15.208
FOR STANDING UP
TO OPPRESSION.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.844
THANKS.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.379
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THIS ELECTION, MR. B.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.981
YOU KNOW, EVERY FOUR YEARS,

16:22.015 --> 16:23.783
WE GET THE CHANCE
TO MAKE OUR OWN CHOICE.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.818
PEOPLE MAY TRY TO BRIBE
OR BULLY YOU,

16:25.852 --> 16:30.523
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT BOOTH,
NOBODY CAN TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.525
I LIKE THAT.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.727
(chuckles) I LIKE THAT, TOO.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.900
WELL... THOSE PIGEONS AREN'T
GONNA CATCH THEMSELVES.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.208
HEY, SWEETHEART.
HI.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.642
SO HOW WAS YOUR FIRST TIME?

16:49.676 --> 16:50.777
WHAT?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.716
OH, YOU MEANT VOTING.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.353
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I MEANT?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.757
VOTING.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.326
UM... I DON'T KNOW.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.661
I'M STILL KIND OF
THINKING IT OVER.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.530
I-I WENT TO ONE OF THOSE
WEB SITES YOU RECOMMENDED.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.165
THAT'S GOOD.
MM-HMM.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.501
AND ONE KRISTIN RECOMMENDED.
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.936
HEY! THEY JUST CALLED NEW YORK
FOR OBAMA!

17:16.969 --> 17:18.405
WHAT A SURPRISE--NEW YORK,

17:18.438 --> 17:22.008
THE STATE THAT OUTLAWED
THE BIG GULP.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.510
HEY, MANDY, HUSTLE UP.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.412
POLLING PLACES CLOSE
IN 28 MINUTES.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.713
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.115
THIS IS A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.549
THEY'LL KEEP 'EM OPEN
A LITTLE BIT LATER.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.918
DAD, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.286
I DON'T REALLY FEEL
LIKE GOING.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.454
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.289
WELL, YOU CAN'T NOT VOTE.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.690
OKAY, IT'S JUST,
IF I--IF I VOTE ONE WAY,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.292
THEN YOU'LL BE MAD AT ME.
IF I VOTE THE OTHER WAY,

17:39.326 --> 17:40.360
THEN KRISTIN WILL BE
MAD AT ME, SO...

17:40.393 --> 17:42.462
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.465
KRISTIN WILL BE JUST FINE.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.069
I-I DID SOME RESEARCH.
AND?

17:50.103 --> 17:51.638
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE PRESIDENT

17:51.671 --> 17:53.740
DESERVES A CHANCE TO FINISH
WHAT HE STARTED.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.943
DISMANTLING A ROARING
FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM?

17:56.976 --> 18:00.380
YOU WANT HIM TO FINISH
THAT LITTLE JOB?

18:00.413 --> 18:03.416
ACTUALLY, DAD, THE STOCK MARKET
HAS DOUBLED SINCE OBAMA CAME IN.
SO WHAT?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.051
AND DID YOU KNOW
THAT UNDER CLINTON

18:05.084 --> 18:06.486
THERE WAS
A HUGE BUDGET SURPLUS?

18:06.519 --> 18:07.954
AND, OH, BY THE WAY,
CLINTON'S MOM

18:07.987 --> 18:11.191
IS OBAMA'S
SECRETARY OF STATE.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.332
YOU'RE AN 18-YEAR-OLD
ENTERING THE JOB MARKET.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.668
YOU'RE VOTING
FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.303
WAIT. IS THAT ACTUALLY IN HERE?
CAN I REALLY VOTE FOR THAT?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.671
(giggles)

18:24.704 --> 18:27.574
SHE'S VOTING
FOR EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.242
SO YOU'LL BOTH BE
MAKING ZERO.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.977
SEE? I KNEW YOU'D BE
MAD AT ME.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.579
THAT'S WHY I FIGURED
I'D JUST SKIP THE WHOLE THING.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.913
GREAT. YOU HAPPY, DAD?

18:33.946 --> 18:37.184
NO, I'M NOT HAPPY.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.252
I'M RAISING THREE DAUGHTERS.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.654
TWO ARE DEMOCRATS.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.957
THERE'S WET BRAS IN
EVERY BATHROOM IN THIS HOUSE.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.529
GET YOUR I.D.
I'LL DRIVE YOU.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.164
OKAY, BUT I JUST TOLD YOU
I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THE PRES--

18:51.198 --> 18:52.532
BUP-BUP--I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.
I KNOW WHO YOU'RE VOTING FOR.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.334
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT
AGAIN.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.968
I WANT YOU TO STAND UP,
SWEETHEART,

18:56.002 --> 18:57.170
TO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.938
THAT'S WHAT I WANT,
YOU KNOW, SO...

18:58.971 --> 19:02.342
EVEN IF IT'S LIKE PUNCHING
YOUR MOTHER IN THE STOMACH.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.510
RIGHT, HONEY?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.878
NICE TRY.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.780
GET YOUR COAT.
OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.149
WAIT. W-WAIT. SO YOU'RE
ACTUALLY GONNA DRIVE HER

19:10.183 --> 19:12.151
TO GO VOTE FOR
A BLEEDING-HEART LIBERAL?

19:12.185 --> 19:15.522
IN A VEHICLE THAT GETS
4 MILES PER GALLON.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.125
MANDY, LET'S GO!
WAIT. HOLD ON.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.027
(chuckles) YOU JUST WANT
TO DRIVE HER

19:21.060 --> 19:22.895
SO THAT YOU CAN TRY
AND CHANGE HER MIND ON THE WAY.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.131
BY LAW, I CAN CAMPAIGN
UP UNTIL 100 FEET

19:25.164 --> 19:27.133
IN FRONT OF A POLLING PLACE.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.369
LISTEN.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.439
I MAY HAVE LOST YOU, BUT I STILL
HAVE A SHOT WITH HER.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.409
YOU'LL NEVER LOSE ME, DAD.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.479
BUT I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.848
AND I'M GONNA GO PUT ON
MY OBAMA SHIRT.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.050
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU
IN MY TRUCK.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.853
THEN I'LL RIDE ON THE ROOF,
LIKE ROMNEY'S DOG.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.021
OKAY, SO MAYBE
HE SHOULD HAVE PUT THAT DOG

19:49.055 --> 19:51.057
IN A LITTLE CARRYALL,
KINDA LIKE THE ONE

19:51.090 --> 19:54.227
OBAMA USES
TO CARRY BIDEN AROUND!

19:58.698 --> 20:00.333
YOU OKAY?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.201
YEAH, I'M AN AWESOME DAD.
I'M A GOOD--
YOU ARE. YOU ARE.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.538
YOU KNOW, I'M RAISING STRONG,
INDEPENDENT-MINDED WOMEN.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.939
YOU MARRIED ONE, TOO.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.277
(chuckles)
NO, I MARRIED
A LOVELY MIDWESTERN GIRL.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.580
THAT STRONG, INDEPENDENT THING
REALLY BLINDSIDED ME.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.782
(laughs)
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

20:15.815 --> 20:19.051
AH! THEY JUST CALLED
MICHIGAN FOR OBAMA.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.888
(forced chuckle)

20:30.129 --> 20:31.964
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BOYD?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.400
I DON'T KNOW.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.969
(chuckles) WHAT WAS
YOUR DAD THINKING?

20:37.003 --> 20:40.573
I DON'T KNOW.
I WANTED A KITE.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.810
THAT'S A TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE
GIFT FOR A KID YOUR AGE.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.313
HEY, UM...

20:46.346 --> 20:48.080
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT
IN THE BACKYARD

20:48.114 --> 20:49.316
AND BLOW STUFF UP
WITH A CHERRY BOMB?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.818
YAY!

20:53.320 --> 20:55.755
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
BLOW UP, GRANDPA?

20:55.788 --> 20:58.124
(whispers)
GO GET THE ABACUS.

21:00.126 --> 21:00.192
OKAY.
