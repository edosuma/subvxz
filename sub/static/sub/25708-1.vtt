04:14.382 --> 04:18.612

The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.

Delivery will be via air
to the Finance Ministry

41:45.313 --> 41:47.244
An armored motorcade

42:13.579 --> 42:15.047
The asset.

42:16.913 --> 42:19.877
We paid a great deal of
money for this information.

42:22.412 --> 42:25.246
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

42:26.345 --> 42:28.010
His name is Solomon Lane.

42:28.012 --> 42:30.946
British Special Agent
turned anarchist.

42:31.745 --> 42:33.843
He used rogue
covert operatives

42:33.845 --> 42:36.279
to create a terror network
called the Syndicate.

42:37.212 --> 42:40.477
Sabotage, assassination,
mass murder.

42:40.479 --> 42:43.077

42:43.079 --> 42:46.576

You seem displeased, Lark.

43:00.845 --> 43:03.779
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear.

43:04.578 --> 43:07.111
I came to Paris
for plutonium.

43:07.113 --> 43:09.778
Well, there must be
a misunderstanding.

43:09.780 --> 43:11.778
I'm just a broker.

43:11.780 --> 43:14.376
I connect a buyer
and a seller.

43:14.378 --> 43:18.380
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

43:19.279 --> 43:20.879
Extract Lane

43:21.478 --> 43:23.543

I wanted Lark to break

47:10.312 --> 47:12.209
I'm guessing
that wasn't Lark.

More likely
one of Lark's recruits.

47:13.813 --> 47:16.277
Not according

47:16.279 --> 47:18.413
Intelligence gathered
by whom?

47:20.645 --> 47:22.576
Hunt.

47:22.578 --> 47:26.209
You've long held suspicions that
Lark was an American agent.

47:26.211 --> 47:27.977
Someone who knew
our every move.

47:27.979 --> 47:30.347
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

47:31.578 --> 47:35.343
You're suggesting
Hunt is John Lark.

47:35.345 --> 47:39.810
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

47:39.812 --> 47:41.444
It won't work.

47:41.446 --> 47:44.843
Think about it. Would a man
as careful as Lark

47:44.845 --> 47:46.942
really stick his neck out
like that?

47:46.944 --> 47:49.210
For a face-to-face
with the White Widow?

47:49.212 --> 47:51.977
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

47:51.979 --> 47:53.543
And if he was really smart,

47:53.545 --> 47:56.310
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

47:56.312 --> 47:58.511
in front of
a reliable witness.

47:58.513 --> 47:59.743
Me.

47:59.745 --> 48:03.210
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

48:03.212 --> 48:05.943
So he pays a man
to play the part of Lark

48:05.945 --> 48:07.744
and has him killed.

48:07.746 --> 48:10.544
And under the guise
of serving his country...

48:10.546 --> 48:13.209
Assumes his own
secret identity.

48:13.211 --> 48:14.611

48:16.679 --> 48:18.244
Why?

48:18.246 --> 48:20.376
Why would Hunt turn?

48:20.378 --> 48:24.177
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

48:24.179 --> 48:27.244
They were believers
in a cause.

48:27.246 --> 48:29.510
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

48:29.512 --> 48:32.411
they turned
against their masters.

48:32.413 --> 48:35.842
How many times has Hunt's
government betrayed him,

48:35.844 --> 48:37.976
disavowed him,
cast him aside?

And how long before
a man like that

Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.107
Capturing the plutonium, and
the Apostles, and John Lark

01:19:52.109 --> 01:19:54.541
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

01:19:54.543 --> 01:19:56.241
But if Sloane knew
the meeting was a trap,

01:19:56.243 --> 01:19:57.676
why didn't she just tell us?

01:19:57.678 --> 01:19:59.808
<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John Lark,

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:01.611
including one of us.

01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:05.044
And now her suspicions
are confirmed.

01:20:07.244 --> 01:20:08.642
According to that dossier,

01:20:08.644 --> 01:20:11.475
a trail of electronic evidence
connects Hunt

01:20:11.477 --> 01:20:14.475
to the theft of smallpox
from the CDC.

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:17.041
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

01:20:17.043 --> 01:20:19.141
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Delbruuk.

01:20:19.143 --> 01:20:21.675
And, of course, Hunt
handed over the plutonium

01:20:21.677 --> 01:20:23.409
to the Apostles himself.

01:20:23.411 --> 01:20:25.442
Now, those facts,
coupled with

01:20:25.444 --> 01:20:28.676
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

01:20:28.678 --> 01:20:31.110
corroborate a CIA narrative

01:20:31.943 --> 01:20:34.242
that Hunt has snapped.

01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:36.409
And that his search for Lark
is nothing but a cover

01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:38.478
to hide the fact
that Lark...

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:40.545
...is me.

01:20:42.544 --> 01:20:44.776
<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> I've got to

Normally, when people refer to
you as your own worst enemy,

01:20:47.311 --> 01:20:49.177
it's just a figure of speech.

01:20:53.511 --> 01:20:57.107
I'm afraid Sloane's got some
questions for her as well.

01:20:57.109 --> 01:21:00.242
The Widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

01:21:00.244 --> 01:21:02.545
And where did Sloane
get this information?

01:21:03.376 --> 01:21:05.274
<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> She didn't say.

01:21:05.276 --> 01:21:08.141

01:21:08.143 --> 01:21:10.341
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:13.208
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:15.075

- <b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> Hunt.

no intention of going back.

01:21:17.576 --> 01:21:19.142
That's why
we're taking him back.

01:21:19.144 --> 01:21:22.309
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:23.675
- Ethan...
- <b><font color="#404040">ETHAN:</font></b> Sir, what do you

01:21:23.677 --> 01:21:24.874
think this is?
A coincidence?

That someone just
happened upon this?

01:21:26.143 --> 01:21:28.541
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

01:21:28.543 --> 01:21:30.708
Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in.

01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:31.974
Don't you see?

01:21:31.976 --> 01:21:33.874
This, sir...

01:21:33.876 --> 01:21:35.508
This is the trap.

01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:37.474
- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:40.207
There are still two plutonium
cores in the wind!

01:21:40.209 --> 01:21:42.644
And you lost them!

01:21:44.344 --> 01:21:47.275
In fairness, sir,
we all lost them.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:50.274
Respectfully, sir,
you weren't there.

01:21:50.276 --> 01:21:54.074
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:57.609
Good God, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

01:21:57.611 --> 01:22:00.541
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

01:22:00.543 --> 01:22:03.475
This is as close as you're ever
gonna get to that plutonium.

01:22:03.477 --> 01:22:05.409
Sir, you don't
actually believe this.

01:22:05.411 --> 01:22:07.676
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

01:22:07.678 --> 01:22:10.245
or the IMF, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

01:22:11.643 --> 01:22:12.974
And if I refuse?

01:22:12.976 --> 01:22:15.208
What do you think
he's here for?

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:16.676
You think
he's some observer?

01:22:16.678 --> 01:22:18.107
He's an assassin!

01:40:47.075 --> 01:40:49.574
They were happy

But every time something
bad happened in the world,

01:40:52.677 --> 01:40:55.408
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

01:40:55.410 --> 01:40:58.141

"Who's watching the world

watching me?"

01:41:00.476 --> 01:41:03.806

that someday, somehow,

something truly terrible
was going to happen

01:41:08.309 --> 01:41:10.675

01:45:03.176 --> 01:45:05.907
Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

01:45:05.909 --> 01:45:08.173
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

01:45:08.175 --> 01:45:10.639
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:13.307

to cut both fuses.

01:45:13.309 --> 01:45:14.939
So one of us
needs to get the detonator

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:16.006

Okay. We copy.

Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

- He'll get it done!

02:13:38.473 --> 02:13:40.673
We're out of time. We just
have to hope he has it.

02:13:40.675 --> 02:13:43.005
- Okay, we're ready.
- <i>At two seconds we cut.</i>

02:13:43.007 --> 02:13:44.539
Wait, wait, wait! Why two?
Why not one?

02:13:44.541 --> 02:13:45.937
You want to cut it that close?

02:13:45.939 --> 02:13:47.204
It's a second
we'll never get back.

02:13:47.206 --> 02:13:48.371
Can we make
a decision on this?

02:13:48.373 --> 02:13:49.872
All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

02:13:49.874 --> 02:13:50.938
Cutting on one?

02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:52.100
Yes, one.
