00:24.983 --> 00:26.234
Will!

00:28.236 --> 00:29.237
Will!

00:29.320 --> 00:30.864
- Dustin!
- Mrs. Byers?

00:30.947 --> 00:32.741
What's going on? Where's Will?

00:33.575 --> 00:34.826
The field!

00:37.829 --> 00:40.749
Will. I just found him like this!

00:40.832 --> 00:42.500
I think he's having another episode!

00:44.127 --> 00:46.588
Will! Will! Will!

00:46.671 --> 00:49.424
Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom!

00:50.383 --> 00:51.383
Will!

00:55.930 --> 00:57.515
Will, wake up!

00:57.599 --> 00:58.808
Can you hear me?

01:02.228 --> 01:04.980
Will, please, just wake up.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.065
Please, wake up!

01:08.777 --> 01:09.819
It's Mom!

01:11.446 --> 01:12.489
It's me!

02:28.231 --> 02:30.275
Okay, that totally freaked me out.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.985
Did that not freak you guys out?

02:32.068 --> 02:35.363
- Two episodes in two days.
- It's getting worse.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.115
You think it's True Sight?

02:37.198 --> 02:38.491
What's True Sight?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.369
It's nothing.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.960
I can't remember.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.713
I need you to try.

02:53.381 --> 02:57.218
I... I was on the field and...
and then it...

02:57.302 --> 03:00.847
it all just went blank, and...
and then you were there.

03:02.181 --> 03:05.351
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.228
I am.

03:20.366 --> 03:24.078
This shape, I saw it on the video tape
from Halloween night.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.414
It's the same shape as... as your drawing.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.252
These episodes that you're having,
I think Dr. Owens is wrong.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.670
I think they're real.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.965
But... but I can't help you
if I don't know what's going on.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.010
So, you have to talk to me. Please.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.514
No more secrets, okay?

03:46.017 --> 03:47.018
Okay.

03:47.101 --> 03:50.813
Did... did you see this thing again
on the field?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.069
Yes.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.697
What... what is it?

04:03.409 --> 04:04.827
I don't know.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.082
It's almost
more like a feeling.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.835
Like the one you had
that night at the arcade?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.341
Yes.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.344
What does it want?

04:24.222 --> 04:26.140
I don't know.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.310
It came for me, and...

04:29.394 --> 04:30.395
Go away!

04:30.478 --> 04:34.732
And I tried. I tried to make it go away.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.443
But it got me, Mom.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.736
Well, what does that mean?

04:38.820 --> 04:42.323
I felt it... everywhere.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.200
Everywhere.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.078
I... I still feel it.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.665
I just want this to be over.

04:50.748 --> 04:54.210
It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.170
Listen. Look, look at me.

04:56.754 --> 05:01.217
I will never, ever let anything bad
happen to you ever again.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.972
Whatever's going on in you,
we're gonna fix it. I will fix it.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.309
I promise. I'm here.

05:51.642 --> 05:55.021
"Friends don't lie."
Isn't that your bullshit saying?

05:55.104 --> 05:57.815
Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!

06:00.985 --> 06:03.446
Where'd you go
on your little field trip, huh?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.197
Where?

06:07.158 --> 06:08.743
Did you go see Mike?

06:09.660 --> 06:10.661
He didn't see me.

06:10.745 --> 06:15.208
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter
did and they called the cops.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.503
Now, did anyone else see you?

06:18.586 --> 06:20.421
Anyone at all?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.256
Come on, I need you to think!

06:22.340 --> 06:24.425
Nobody saw me!

06:25.718 --> 06:27.386
You put us in danger.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.764
You realize that, right?

06:29.847 --> 06:31.974
You promised...

06:33.726 --> 06:35.019
I go!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.729
And I never leave!

06:37.563 --> 06:39.023
Nothing ever happens!

06:39.107 --> 06:42.443
Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!

06:45.196 --> 06:46.405
You lie!

06:46.489 --> 06:50.368
I don't lie!
I protect and I feed and I teach!

06:50.451 --> 06:54.831
And all I ask of you is
that you follow three simple rules.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.999
Three rules. And you know what?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.211
You can't even do that!

07:06.134 --> 07:07.135
You're grounded.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.637
You know what that means?

07:10.346 --> 07:12.432
It means no Eggos...

07:15.435 --> 07:18.146
And no TV for a week.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.779
All right, knock it off. Let go.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.909
Okay.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.578
Two weeks.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.289
Let go!

07:37.748 --> 07:39.876
- A month!
- No!

07:41.627 --> 07:43.087
Well, congratulations.

07:43.171 --> 07:48.217
You just graduated from no TV for a month
to no TV at all!

07:48.301 --> 07:49.594
No!

07:50.803 --> 07:53.264
No! No. No!

07:53.347 --> 07:57.894
You have got to understand that
there are consequences to your actions.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.937
You are like Papa!

08:00.021 --> 08:01.230
Really?

08:01.898 --> 08:04.025
I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.153
Wow! All right.
You wanna go back in the lab?

08:07.945 --> 08:09.614
One phone call. I can make that happen.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.240
I hate you.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.242
Yeah, well,
I'm not so crazy about you, either.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.119
You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.454
You know what that word means?

08:16.537 --> 08:19.582
How about that be your word
for the day, huh? Brat.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.710
Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.794
Brat.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.301
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.846
Hey!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.140
Hey!

08:36.974 --> 08:38.392
Hey! Hey!

08:40.311 --> 08:42.020
Open this door!

08:42.104 --> 08:44.023
Open the damn door!

08:44.106 --> 08:45.733
You wanna go out in the world?

08:45.816 --> 08:47.401
You better grow up!

08:47.485 --> 08:49.278
Grow the hell up!

09:14.011 --> 09:15.096
Mom?

09:17.473 --> 09:18.599
Will?

09:22.144 --> 09:23.396
Hello?

10:01.976 --> 10:03.644
Do you like those grapes, Holly?

10:04.770 --> 10:07.773
Hey, Mom, I was thinking about
staying the night at Stacey's tonight?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.483
We were gonna have a girl's night.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.278
Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip...

10:12.361 --> 10:14.196
Sure! That sounds like fun.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.075
Toast? No?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.296
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.799
Did you see your mom?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.552
No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.307
You don't have to do this, you know.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.184
Stop saying that.

10:54.695 --> 10:58.491
- Hawkins Police.
- Flo, it's Joyce again.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.576
Oh, hi, Joyce.
Listen, I gave him your message...

11:00.660 --> 11:02.370
- He's still not there?
- No, but...

11:02.453 --> 11:05.122
Did he get any of my messages
from yesterday? Did you give...

11:05.206 --> 11:08.668
- Yes, do you wanna talk to...
- No, no, I need Hopper.

11:08.751 --> 11:13.172
Just tell him to call me
the second he gets in. Please.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.965
- Thank you.
- Bye.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.556
Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.058
- Any better?
- Mmm-mmm.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.394
Same as last night? Still weird?

11:26.477 --> 11:27.561
Yeah.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.313
All right.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.565
Hmm.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.072
Okay, let me see.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.830
Is it a fever?

11:46.872 --> 11:51.043
No. Uh, actually, it's cold.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.420
Do you feel cold?

11:52.503 --> 11:56.132
No. Just a little out of it.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.634
Like I haven't really woken up yet.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.012
You promised no doctor.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.056
And I meant it. No doctor.

12:04.723 --> 12:05.724
You know what?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.227
I'm gonna run you a nice bath
and it'll warm you up

12:08.310 --> 12:09.895
and hopefully get you feeling better.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.022
How's that sound? Okay.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.747
Morning, Dart.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.417
Got you some breakfast.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.877
Your favorite.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.007
I gotta go to school,

12:38.090 --> 12:40.176
but I'll be back soon. Sound good?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.531
Stop being a baby
and do it already!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.075
This is so disgusting.
Is this really necessary?

13:07.703 --> 13:08.913
What the hell's going on?

13:08.996 --> 13:11.123
What do you think? We're looking for Dart.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.750
- Jesus!
- Oh!

13:12.833 --> 13:14.043
Ugh!

13:15.794 --> 13:17.379
Well, well, well.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.757
Look who finally decided to show up.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.676
After I drew the short straw.
Real convenient.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.678
You stink!

13:28.390 --> 13:29.391
Hi, Max.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.227
Hi.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.688
- Where's Will?
- He'll be here.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.482
Are you just gonna stand there?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.234
Or you gonna help?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.574
All living things,
from complex mammals

13:45.658 --> 13:48.827
to single-celled organisms,
instinctively respond to danger.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.873
Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical,
and it will flee.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.543
Or deploy some other defense mechanism.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.046
We're very much the same.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.510
When we encounter danger,
our hearts start pounding.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.725
Our palms start to sweat.

14:14.770 --> 14:20.067
These are the signs of the physical
and emotional state we call...

14:21.402 --> 14:22.528
fear.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.107
Hey, you reached Jim.

14:29.159 --> 14:32.162
I'm probably doing something
incredible right now and I can't...

14:32.997 --> 14:34.206
Mom.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, sweetie, what is it?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.334
It's too hot.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.637
I... I can cool it down
a little bit, baby,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.931
- but we gotta get your body temp back up.
- No.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.726
What?

14:55.477 --> 14:56.770
He likes it cold.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.298
Hey, kid.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.806
Listen, um...

15:34.642 --> 15:36.727
about last night, I, uh...

15:42.900 --> 15:45.069
I want this place cleaned up
by the time I get back

15:45.152 --> 15:47.363
and then maybe I'll consider
fixing the TV.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.656
You hear me?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.624
Come in, Hop.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.460
Come in, Hop.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.171
Come in, Hop.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.508
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm on my way in,

16:07.591 --> 16:10.344
and, yes, I do know what time it is.

16:11.095 --> 16:14.848
Joyce Byers has called
eight times already this morning.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.475
Eight times.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.895
For my sake, please deal with her!

16:25.150 --> 16:28.737
Let's go. Pass it up now.
Get open!

16:29.446 --> 16:33.200
All right! All right, all right!

16:33.283 --> 16:35.661
King Steve. King Steve, everyone.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.579
I like it. Playing tough today.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.331
Jesus! Do you ever stop talking?
Come on!

16:39.415 --> 16:40.958
What?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.711
You afraid the coach is gonna
bench you now that I'm here? Huh?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.637
You were moving your feet.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.974
Plant them next time, draw a charge.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.069
Don't sweat it, Harrington.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.864
Today's just not your day, man.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.949
Yeah. Not your week.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.588
You and the princess break up for one day,

17:16.617 --> 17:18.369
she's running off
with the freak's brother.

17:20.079 --> 17:23.416
Oh, shit. You don't know.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.588
Jonathan and the princess skipped
yesterday. Still haven't shown.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.632
But that must just be
a coincidence, right?

17:33.844 --> 17:35.596
Don't take it too hard, man.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.849
A pretty boy like you has got
nothing to worry about.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.518
Plenty of bitches in the sea.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.980
Am I right?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.360
I'll be sure to leave you some.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.085
It's 15 past.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.711
Yeah, I know.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.422
Just give him time.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.386
That guy. There.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.766
- What?
- He just... just talked to himself.

18:33.153 --> 18:36.490
Duck, duck, duck,

18:36.573 --> 18:39.409
duck, duck...

18:46.500 --> 18:49.044
Duck, duck, duck...

18:54.466 --> 18:57.010
Duck, duck, duck...

18:59.555 --> 19:00.722
Duck...

19:02.474 --> 19:05.102
Duck, duck...

19:05.185 --> 19:06.645
Goose!

19:06.728 --> 19:08.188
I think we should go.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.430
Trouble with your car, miss?
I can give you two a lift if you like.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.683
Jonathan.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.402
You sure you don't need that ride?

20:17.674 --> 20:18.800
Hello?

20:18.884 --> 20:20.344
Leave it open.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.805
Where the hell have you been?

20:23.889 --> 20:27.226
I overslept. What the hell's going on?
It's freezing.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.899
Hey! Knock, knock.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.361
We have a visitor.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.160
So this thing, this shadow thing.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.996
You told your mom it likes it like this.
It likes it cold?

20:48.997 --> 20:49.998
Yeah.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.251
How do you know that?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.003
I just know.

20:59.716 --> 21:00.717
Does he talk to you?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.220
No. It's like...

21:03.303 --> 21:04.972
I don't have to think.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.723
I just know things now.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.434
Things I never did before.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.233
And, uh...

21:17.276 --> 21:18.402
what else do you know?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.655
It's hard to explain.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.200
It's like old memories
in the back of my head,

21:25.284 --> 21:28.537
only... they're not my memories.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.414
Okay.

21:31.873 --> 21:35.002
I mean, I don't think
they're old memories at all. They're...

21:36.003 --> 21:39.548
they're now-memories,
happening all at once, now.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.883
Can you describe these now-memories?

21:45.887 --> 21:48.473
I don't know.
It's... it's hard to explain.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.601
I know it's hard
but can you just... Can you try?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.353
For us?

21:55.689 --> 21:56.898
It's like...

21:57.858 --> 22:01.028
They're growing and spreading...

22:02.362 --> 22:03.363
killing.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.282
The memories?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.659
I don't know.

22:09.953 --> 22:10.954
Oh!

22:11.038 --> 22:13.874
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.466
Hey, hey, sweetie...

22:23.508 --> 22:25.719
what if you didn't have to use words?

22:51.787 --> 22:54.747
Hey,
you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...

22:57.751 --> 22:58.752
Anything?

22:58.835 --> 23:02.506
We need to talk. AV room. Right now.

23:04.883 --> 23:05.884
Party members only.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.053
Come on, Mike.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.846
No! This is non-negotiable.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.808
- Sorry, Max.
- Sorry.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.358
Will didn't want me to tell anyone,

23:21.441 --> 23:24.945
but on Halloween night
he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.863
A shadow?

23:26.947 --> 23:28.573
What kind of shadow?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.408
I don't know. But it scared him.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.161
And if Will really has True Sight...

23:33.245 --> 23:35.455
I mean, if he can really see
into the Upside Down,

23:35.539 --> 23:37.541
maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.086
- So that's why he was frozen like that?
- Maybe.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.170
Can it hurt him?

23:42.254 --> 23:45.006
I mean, if this shadow thing
isn't from our world...

23:45.090 --> 23:46.758
I'm not sure. Dustin?

23:46.842 --> 23:48.218
Well, if you're in another plane,

23:48.301 --> 23:50.137
you can't interact
with the material plane,

23:50.220 --> 23:52.305
so theoretically,
no, the shadow can't hurt him.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.015
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.685
This isn't D & D. This is real life.

23:56.768 --> 23:57.769
So what do we do?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.563
We acquire more knowledge.

23:59.646 --> 24:02.149
I'll go to Will's after school.
See what's going on.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.552
You guys stay here and find Dart.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.318
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.945
Will heard him in the Upside Down.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.448
I don't know how yet,
but he's gotta be connected to all this.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.616
He's gotta be.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.786
If we find Dart,
maybe we can solve this thing.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.205
Maybe we can help Will.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.700
Hey! Hey, assholes!

26:17.284 --> 26:18.827
Let us out of here!

26:20.453 --> 26:21.871
Oh!

26:22.872 --> 26:24.833
Not very pleasant in here, is it?

26:24.916 --> 26:29.129
Sorry about that.
Hospitality's not our strong suit.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.131
You know, scientists and all.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.303
Yeah. Okay.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.347
You up for a little walk?

26:42.100 --> 26:44.644
I'm assuming you're behind me.

26:44.728 --> 26:48.064
"Men of science have made
abundant mistakes of every kind."

26:48.148 --> 26:49.649
George Sarton said that.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.569
You guys know who George Sarton is?
Doesn't really matter.

26:52.652 --> 26:55.113
The point is,
mistakes have been made. Yes.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.489
- Mistakes?
- Yes.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.699
You killed Barbara.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.619
Abundant mistakes, but,
the men involved with those mistakes,

27:01.703 --> 27:05.623
the ones responsible for what happened
to your brother and Miss Holland's death,

27:05.707 --> 27:08.418
they're gone.
They're gone, and for better for worse,

27:08.501 --> 27:10.621
I'm the schmuck they brought in
to make things better.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.840
But I can't make things better
without your help.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.550
You mean without us shutting up?

27:15.633 --> 27:18.928
She's tough, this one.
You guys been together long?

27:19.012 --> 27:21.765
- We're not together.
- Wanna see what really killed your friend?

27:24.809 --> 27:28.229
Teddy, I brought you an audience today.
I hope you don't mind.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.522
More the merrier, sir.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.445
I'd call it one hell of a mistake.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.030
Wouldn't you?

27:40.075 --> 27:45.497
See, the thing is,
we can't seem to erase our mistake...

27:45.580 --> 27:47.999
but we can stop it from spreading.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.086
Like, it's like pulling weeds.

27:51.711 --> 27:55.298
But imagine for a moment
if a foreign state,

27:55.382 --> 27:58.843
let's say, the Soviets...
If they heard about our mistake...

27:59.677 --> 28:02.097
do you think they would even
consider that a mistake?

28:03.598 --> 28:05.392
What if they tried to replicate that?

28:12.190 --> 28:14.776
The more attention we bring to ourselves,
the more...

28:14.859 --> 28:17.237
the more people like the Hollands
know the truth,

28:17.320 --> 28:19.531
the more likely that scenario becomes.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.285
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.329
Just, same as those weeds there.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.750
By whatever means necessary.

28:36.131 --> 28:40.009
So, we understand each other now,
don't we?

29:02.907 --> 29:05.452
This is more of the same.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.788
Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.

29:09.622 --> 29:10.623
Wait!

29:11.875 --> 29:12.959
- What? What?
- Wait.

29:13.042 --> 29:16.379
- Wait. These black lines, see?
- What?

29:17.547 --> 29:19.174
Look, they connect.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.137
They connect.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.564
Does this mean anything to you?

30:16.648 --> 30:17.649
No.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.611
I mean,
is it some sort of maze or a road?

30:22.153 --> 30:26.908
I mean, it's sort of forking
and branching like... like lightning.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.159
You think it's that storm?

30:28.243 --> 30:31.788
No, the storm he drew was
completely different. He used red.

30:31.871 --> 30:36.000
And this is all blue
and it has some weird dirt color.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.795
I mean, maybe it's roots.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.422
'Cause remember,
he was saying it was spreading and...

30:41.506 --> 30:42.882
Killing.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.551
He said they were killing.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.887
Vines.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.271
He's drawing vines.

30:59.315 --> 31:03.236
Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin?
We're supposed to meet after class.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.197
Max!

31:07.198 --> 31:10.702
Hey, Max! Hey, where you going?
Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.161
Yeah, good luck with that.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.332
What is wrong with you?

31:16.416 --> 31:18.251
What is wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

31:18.918 --> 31:22.338
- I don't understand.
- No! I don't understand!

31:22.422 --> 31:24.299
You guys act like
you want me to be your friend

31:24.382 --> 31:25.842
but then you treat me like garbage!

31:25.925 --> 31:27.635
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is!

31:27.719 --> 31:29.012
You go and hide in the AV Club,

31:29.095 --> 31:31.389
keeping secrets like we're
in second grade or something.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.892
You know, I thought you guys wanted me
in your party.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.394
- We do. But it's...
- But what?

31:37.228 --> 31:39.564
There... there are just things.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.066
Things we can't tell you, all right?
For your own safety.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.860
- My own safety?
- Yes!

31:43.943 --> 31:47.280
- Because I'm a girl?
- What? No!

31:47.363 --> 31:49.157
Did you keep secrets from El?

31:50.909 --> 31:52.160
How do you know about El?

31:52.243 --> 31:53.578
Did you?

31:53.661 --> 31:55.872
That was different. Trust me. Okay?

31:55.955 --> 31:57.957
That was just... just different.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.460
Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay?

32:01.044 --> 32:03.463
I don't wanna be in your
stupid party anyway. I'm out.

32:04.213 --> 32:05.632
Have a nice life.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.720
- Max!
- You still stink, by the way!

32:13.348 --> 32:14.766
Oh, shit!

32:26.986 --> 32:29.697
That kid you were talking to, who is he?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.240
He's no one.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.368
- No one?
- This kid from my class.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.805
Why was he talking to you?

32:53.888 --> 32:55.640
It was just about
a stupid class assignment.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.476
- Then why're you so upset?
- I'm not!

32:58.559 --> 32:59.560
He causing you trouble?

33:00.269 --> 33:01.396
Why do you care?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.272
Because, Max, you're a piece of shit,

33:03.356 --> 33:05.775
but we're family now
whether we like it or not,

33:05.858 --> 33:07.694
meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.088
- What would I ever do without...
- Hey!

33:11.030 --> 33:12.782
This is serious shit, okay?

33:12.865 --> 33:14.409
I'm older than you.

33:14.492 --> 33:15.785
And something you learn

33:15.868 --> 33:19.163
is that there are a certain type of people
in this world that you stay away from,

33:19.247 --> 33:21.874
and that kid, Max...

33:21.958 --> 33:24.877
That kid is one of them.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.755
You stay away from him, you hear me?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.716
Stay away.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.353
"Ives.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.190
Terry."

34:45.373 --> 34:46.918
Jane.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.184
Papa.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.517
...President Reagan's...

36:25.892 --> 36:28.394
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

36:44.535 --> 36:45.745
Rainbow.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.041
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.464
Rainbow.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.424
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.259
Four-fifty...

37:07.350 --> 37:08.351
Jane.

37:12.813 --> 37:13.940
Mama?

37:27.995 --> 37:29.455
Mama!

37:34.210 --> 37:35.962
Mama?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.053
Mama!

37:45.263 --> 37:46.764
Mama!

37:51.352 --> 37:52.561
Mama...

38:07.451 --> 38:08.619
Mama!

38:18.879 --> 38:19.964
Hello?

38:20.047 --> 38:21.173
Will!

38:21.799 --> 38:23.759
Mrs. Byers?

38:23.843 --> 38:25.886
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.638
- Is Will here?
- You know what?

38:27.722 --> 38:29.098
Now is not a really good time.

38:29.181 --> 38:30.266
Is he okay?

38:31.976 --> 38:35.313
Yeah. You know, he's...
he's just not feeling real well.

38:35.396 --> 38:38.524
He's laying down,
so I'll tell him you stopped by, okay?

38:40.067 --> 38:42.862
It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?

38:52.830 --> 38:54.040
Have a nice day.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.078
Doesn't really matter.
The point is, mistakes have been made.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.329
- Yes.
- Mistakes?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.172
The men involved
with those mistakes,

39:36.207 --> 39:38.376
the ones responsible
for what happened to your brother

39:38.459 --> 39:41.045
and Miss Holland's death, they're gone...

39:42.046 --> 39:44.507
...the ones responsible
for what happened to your brother

39:44.590 --> 39:47.051
and Miss Holland's death, they're gone.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.056
You still wanna do this?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.935
Let's burn that lab to the ground.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.159
Mew-mew, dinner!

40:12.243 --> 40:14.912
Where are you? Mew-mew!

40:15.496 --> 40:17.331
- Hey, Dusty!
- Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.917
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.

40:24.046 --> 40:26.590
Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.176
It's about my friend, Will.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.053
I think...

40:45.651 --> 40:46.777
What the hell?

40:52.867 --> 40:54.076
Dart?

42:44.728 --> 42:46.146
Oh, Jesus.
