"In order that capitalism

00:21.588 --> 00:24.318
could come to dominate
other ways of life,

00:24.457 --> 00:26.118
it had to originate somewhere

00:26.259 --> 00:29.990
as a modus vivendi common
to whole groups of man. "

00:31.097 --> 00:32.758
Nothing?

00:32.899 --> 00:33.923
Hello?

00:34.067 --> 00:36.467
Hillary Clinton is president,
sir!

00:36.603 --> 00:40.437
I thought I would just
try to scare you out of it.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.473
I need you to wake up, sir.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.601
Your son-in-law
has taken over the company.

00:45.745 --> 00:48.339
He's installed your daughter
as the CEO.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.540
Don't get me wrong.
She's a wonderful girl.

00:57.690 --> 01:01.421
I've been stripped of all my
responsibilities, ostracized.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.257
This morning, I had to cut
my own cantaloupe.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.796
They're moving me
from the 52nd floor

01:05.932 --> 01:07.957
down to my new office...

01:08.101 --> 01:09.762
on 12.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.564
12!

01:11.704 --> 01:13.729
You've got to wake up, please!

01:13.873 --> 01:15.101
Ugh!

01:18.578 --> 01:20.011
Oh, God.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.773
Marcus Schenkenberg
was there.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.939
Who?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.779
Okay, the craziest thing
happened this morning.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.443
I was home on my treadmill
and the phone rings,

01:27.587 --> 01:29.782
and you will not believe
who it was.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.947
Liz?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.456
It's, uh, Floyd.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.581
Oh, my God.
Floyd called?

01:33.726 --> 01:34.920
You were using
your treadmill?

01:35.061 --> 01:37.325
Yes, and, yes, Pete,
I use it every day.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.267
Whew!

01:45.405 --> 01:46.770
What did Floyd want?
He's in town.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.498
He was only supposed to be here
for a day,

01:48.641 --> 01:49.835
but there's
some big storm coming,

01:49.976 --> 01:51.967
and his flight on JetFun
got canceled.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.511
JetFun. Is that the one
with the footbaths?

01:53.646 --> 01:54.613
Oh, no, that's AirBike.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.977
They also have in-flight pornos
and NBC news.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.812
JetFun's the one that hands out
fresh popcorn.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.112
Listen to me!

02:00.253 --> 02:03.484
Floyd wants to know
if he can crash at my apartment.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.647
So? What's the big deal?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.191
I haven't seen Floyd
since he left for Cleveland.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.726
The last time I tried
to get in touch with him,

02:08.862 --> 02:11.056
some Rust Belt tramp
answered the phone,

02:11.197 --> 02:13.961
and now he's here and I don't
know what "crash" means.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.863
I just don't want
to embarrass myself.

02:16.002 --> 02:19.369
I want to be top dog for once
instead of just... dog.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.030
Then you need to make him regret
ever leaving.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.801
You need to pretend
you're doing great.

02:22.942 --> 02:23.840
<i>I am doing great.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:24.636
Ohh.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.677
For once,
I am not gonna be Jan Brady.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.303
I'm gonna be Marcia, damn it.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.380
Oh, my nose!

02:29.516 --> 02:30.642
My bad!

02:30.783 --> 02:32.876
See?
It's starting already.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.579
Look out, Floyd.
There is a new Liz and...

02:35.722 --> 02:37.656
Ooh, Sandwich Day.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.348
What's that?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.551
You've never heard
of Sandwich Day?

02:41.694 --> 02:45.095
Why, it's the most wonderful day
of all.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.323
Once a year,

02:46.466 --> 02:49.833
the Teamsters go to this Italian
sandwich shop in Brooklyn.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.062
No one knows what it's called
or where it is.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.730
It's a Teamster secret.

02:54.874 --> 02:57.638
But they buy us
these sandwiches.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.506
Oh, such sandwiches!

02:59.646 --> 03:02.444
And the dipping sauce.
Oh, joy!

03:02.582 --> 03:05.847
God bless us, every one!

03:05.985 --> 03:07.452
Yeah!

03:15.195 --> 03:18.562
Well, I wish you the very best
with the office, Kathy.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.893
By the way,
you know who hates unicorns?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.797
Mark Wahlberg.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.403
Kathy Geiss' office.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.937
Please hold.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.946
Mr. Donaghy, you're not really
going down to 12, are you?

03:36.082 --> 03:37.276
I have to.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.406
Of course it's humiliating.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.109
Banks is trying to shame me
into leaving.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.618
But where else
am I gonna go?

03:41.754 --> 03:44.552
I've been sleeping with the Cindy Crawford
of corporations for the last 22 years.

03:44.691 --> 03:47.888
What am I supposed to do? Just
lie down with some skank like 3M?

03:48.027 --> 03:48.994
What about Washington?

03:49.128 --> 03:50.618
I'm sure your friends in the
Bush Administration would...

03:50.763 --> 03:53.095
Bush?
Has it gotten that bad?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.326
Good God, I'd rather work
for an American car company

03:55.468 --> 03:57.129
than jump
on that sinking ship.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.568
I made you this.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.833
Uh, no.
No, no, you didn't.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.670
Well...

04:06.980 --> 04:11.110
I will remember you?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.186
Will you remember me?

04:14.320 --> 04:15.685
Doobie-doo, doobie-doo?

04:15.822 --> 04:19.349
Don't let your life
pass you by?

04:28.501 --> 04:29.559
Hold it!

04:31.838 --> 04:33.203
Hey, Jack.

04:33.339 --> 04:36.172
I got a company-wide e-mail
from the new CEO

04:36.309 --> 04:39.710
that was just a link
to cats wearing bow ties.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.710
Is everything okay?

04:40.847 --> 04:42.041
Everything's great.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.172
Yeah,
I'm really... crushing it.

04:45.685 --> 04:46.811
Why are you going to 12?

04:46.953 --> 04:47.977
12? Did I hit 12?

04:48.121 --> 04:51.147
I wanted, uh... 4012,

04:51.291 --> 04:54.351
which is 52,
where I work.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.990
Business.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.896
I can't believe
Sandwich Day is over.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.030
Hey, look.
Lutz is still eating.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.641
You're savoring it?

05:09.776 --> 05:11.903
What, you think you're better
than us?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.842
No, that's not it at all.
Since my surgery,

05:13.980 --> 05:16.574
I have to eat slowly
or my insides might explode.

05:16.716 --> 05:17.740
Give me it!

05:18.951 --> 05:20.976
It's like knives!

05:21.120 --> 05:24.886
Look. Liz Lemon's sandwich
is still on her desk.

05:25.024 --> 05:29.051
Ohh. Taking Liz's food
is not good.

05:29.195 --> 05:32.096
Where's my mac and cheese?!

05:32.231 --> 05:37.259
But as far as Liz Lemon knows,
her sandwich never came.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.778
Uh, Liz?

05:48.581 --> 05:50.014
Floyd.
I didn't see you there.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.413
Wow.
You look great.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.576
Do I?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.120
I'm pretty tired
from playing as hard as I work.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.780
Okay, now... bring up 23.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.758
And give me some air.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.323
My key.

06:06.466 --> 06:07.364
Thank you.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.297
Thank you so much
for doing this.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.461
Uh... hey, can I take you
out to dinner tonight?

06:12.605 --> 06:15.472
You know, maybe we hit that
barbecue place you puked at.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.076
You'll have to be
more specific.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.478
Well, I'll see you
back at your place.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.913
Oh, somebody get me
out of this dress!

06:32.058 --> 06:33.355
I can't breathe!

06:35.561 --> 06:37.051
Huh.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.830
You guys are working hard
for once.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.569
Where's my sandwich?!

06:46.706 --> 06:47.638
Lutz made us do it!

06:47.774 --> 06:49.401
No, it was Frank.
No, it was you!

06:49.542 --> 06:50.406
I'm a patsy?

06:50.543 --> 06:52.568
Stop it!

06:52.712 --> 06:54.236
This is all my fault,
Miss Lemon,

06:54.380 --> 06:56.405
because I let it happen,

06:56.549 --> 06:59.313
and the only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil

06:59.452 --> 07:01.181
is for good men
to do nothing.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.255
Please ask my permission
before you quote me, Kenneth.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.290
I don't know how,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.860
but you're gonna get me
another sandwich,

07:08.995 --> 07:11.862
or I'm gonna cut your face up
so bad, you'll have a chin.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.630
You'll all have chins!

07:19.272 --> 07:20.796
<i>Floor 12.</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:29.047
<i>Door closing.</i>

07:33.319 --> 07:35.048
<i>Failure.</i>

07:37.857 --> 07:39.791
It's me again, sir.

07:39.926 --> 07:43.487
I thought you'd like to know
that it's snowing out...

07:43.629 --> 07:47.531
the city all silent and white.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.130
Wake up!

07:51.270 --> 07:52.532
Wake up!

07:54.907 --> 07:56.397
Wow, snow in May.

07:56.542 --> 07:57.702
Thank you, global warming,

07:57.844 --> 07:59.903
for extreme, unpredictable
weather patterns.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.207
There was actually a tornado
in Cleveland last week.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.441
Destroyed
an entire city block...

08:04.584 --> 08:06.677
three bowling alleys,
a liquor store,

08:06.819 --> 08:08.684
and the liquor-store museum.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.948
So, do you have time
to grab dessert?

08:11.090 --> 08:12.785
Yikes!
Do you know it is 4:30?

08:12.925 --> 08:15.120
I haven't stayed up this late
since college.

08:15.261 --> 08:18.856
And behind this trapdoor,
more Orcs.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.523
That'll really piss off Samir.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.658
My flight's in two hours.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.100
I'm sorry. I got to go.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.973
You know, sometimes I really
regret leaving New York.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.043
Like right now,
for instance.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.841
Well, what does New York have
that Cleveland doesn't have?

08:35.982 --> 08:37.916
I read that you guys
are getting an Ikea.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.244
Yeah, I'll believe it
when I see it.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.511
We've just been burned
before.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.957
It was really great seeing you,
Liz.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.592
I'll see you.

08:52.832 --> 08:56.199
Now turn
and look back at me.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.067
Attaboy.
Eat it up, Cleveland.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.665
Whoo!

09:03.809 --> 09:06.209
Oh, God. Youths.

09:06.345 --> 09:07.869
I'm losing it, Don.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.005
I mean, I've been walking
the streets in this crazy snow,

09:10.149 --> 09:12.709
trying to figure out who I am,
where I fit in.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.821
I even stopped to catch
a snowflake with my tongue,

09:15.955 --> 09:17.946
but, evidently, that's some
sort of signal in Chelsea.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.892
Just give me a sign.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.518
I've given everything
to this company,

09:23.663 --> 09:26.860
but now I feel
that maybe I should...

09:26.999 --> 09:28.227
quit.

09:28.367 --> 09:31.734
You have to leave.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.372
What?

09:34.507 --> 09:37.943
Visiting hours were over
some time ago.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.807
What happened to your voice?

09:40.947 --> 09:44.212
I was hit by lightning
as a child.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.750
They made a movie
about me.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.190
You have to leave GE.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.486
What did you say?

09:55.628 --> 09:58.324
Geriatric Extended Care.

09:58.464 --> 10:04.869
That's what this wing
of the hospital is called.

10:07.039 --> 10:10.668
I have to leave GE.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.617
After last night's freak
snowfall, it's 90 and humid.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.014
In other global-warming news,

10:21.153 --> 10:23.678
a tornado hit downtown Detroit,
putting out several fires.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.484
The fire department...

10:30.496 --> 10:31.428
Hello?

10:31.564 --> 10:32.826
How did it go
with Floyd?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.433
The poor guy got Lemoned...
hard.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.503
Started babbling about how he
wished he'd never left New York.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.128
Did you do that thing
I showed you?

10:40.272 --> 10:41.170
No, Jenna,

10:41.307 --> 10:42.865
I did not come back
from the bathroom

10:43.009 --> 10:44.340
and hand him my underwear.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.910
That's how I met
that mobster.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.513
Next time Floyd brings
some cornpone tranny

10:48.648 --> 10:49.512
back to his apartment,

10:49.649 --> 10:51.640
all he's gonna be thinking
about is me,

10:51.784 --> 10:53.251
standing there
in the snow,

10:53.386 --> 10:56.014
looking like the one
who got away.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.122
Crone!

10:57.256 --> 10:58.314
Aah!

10:58.457 --> 11:00.322
We'll get Liz Lemon
her sandwich.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.654
I'm an international superstar.

11:02.795 --> 11:07.164
The Teamsters will be honored
that I'm even talking to them.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.529
That old soft-shoe?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.899
Is comin' around the bend?

11:12.038 --> 11:13.505
That's enough.
That's enough.

11:13.639 --> 11:15.630
Now, you two, kiss.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.039
You with the sport coat,
you're the girl.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.077
What are you doing?

11:20.212 --> 11:22.840
All we want
is one more sandwich.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.542
Or just the name
of the place.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.983
Now, why would we want
our secret place

11:28.120 --> 11:29.314
to become public knowledge

11:29.455 --> 11:32.652
and get overrun
by a bunch of sissies?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.157
I know what driving
the long haul's like.

11:34.293 --> 11:35.726
After my junior year
at Oberlin,

11:35.861 --> 11:37.556
we road-tripped
to South by Southwest.

11:39.465 --> 11:42.696
You lads got a lot of nerve.

11:42.835 --> 11:46.327
You got to earn
that information, girls,

11:46.472 --> 11:49.339
on our terms in competition.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.908
Bible trivia?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.501
Drinking contest.
Here. Tonight.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.636
Come on in.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.113
Uh, a Band-Aid just fell
out of your hair.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.652
Well...

12:02.788 --> 12:03.948
This is fun.
You're back.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.421
What happened?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.422
Good morning.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.925
I'm checking in for Flight 1876
to Cleveland.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.528
Oh, no, no.
We're canceled.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.029
Canceled?
You got to be kidding me!

12:13.165 --> 12:15.133
Oh, I would have checked
my flight...

12:15.267 --> 12:17.064
Oh, no, no.
The airline is canceled.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.534
We're not an airline anymore.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.231
Wait, wait, wait. One storm?
That's all it takes?

12:21.373 --> 12:22.840
We're still
gonna make popcorn.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.136
Just no more airplanes.
I'm sorry.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.939
Hey, Karen, I hate your guts.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.446
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.447
You know, my cell was dead

12:31.584 --> 12:33.518
'cause I didn't bring
my charger.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.550
Ohh.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.619
Who was that bitch that answered
your phone eight months ago?

12:44.764 --> 12:45.753
Whoa!

12:46.265 --> 12:48.460
So, this girl...
What's her lower-back tattoo?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.398
A Chinese character
that she thinks means "peace,"

12:50.536 --> 12:51.867
but it really means
"I have chlamydia"?

12:52.004 --> 12:52.868
Oh, my God.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.199
Liz, I'm so glad
you're bringing this up.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.637
Really? You are?
Yeah, yeah.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.675
I feel bad how we never
got to talk about it,

12:57.810 --> 12:59.300
and I didn't bring it up
last night

12:59.445 --> 13:01.379
because we were having
so much fun,

13:01.514 --> 13:02.674
and I didn't
want to ruin it.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.476
Okay. Well, okay.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.482
I've been thinking about this
a lot,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.883
and it's just... Oh, shoot.
Hold on. I'm sorry.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.682
Oh, I got a flight.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.519
Oh, in 40 minutes.

13:13.659 --> 13:14.921
No, no, no, no, no.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.687
This is more important
than me getting home

13:16.829 --> 13:18.797
or my partner meeting
with Peter Venkman.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.491
No, don't do that. Just go.
But you call me.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.397
I will.
I- I will.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.663
Or you could ride
to the airport with me.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.897
No, it's okay.

13:27.039 --> 13:28.529
You go, and we'll talk.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.403
Okay. Wow.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.238
And I thought you were cool
last night.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.710
I do rock.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.815
A drinking contest?

13:36.949 --> 13:39.747
What am I, 12 and at
my boyfriend's frat party?

13:39.885 --> 13:40.852
We need you, Jenna.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.920
Lutz can't drink
because of his operation.

13:43.055 --> 13:44.079
Kenneth doesn't drink.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.850
Drinking's
against my beliefs,

13:45.991 --> 13:47.925
like gambling
or freeway driving.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.722
And I can't drink! I still got
my Hollywood sock on.

13:50.863 --> 13:53.024
And I can't have booze
because I'm on antibiotics

13:53.165 --> 13:55.258
after having
some skanky club sex.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.266
He's on antibiotics
because he lost his lucky penny

13:57.403 --> 13:58.665
and assumed
it fell in his ear again.

13:58.804 --> 13:59.668
Shut up, Lutz.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.932
Your surgery was
for an undescended testicle.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.634
Wrong again. It was for
two undescended testicles.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.541
Okay, wait. So, no one else is
drinking against the Teamsters?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.375
It's only me?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.006
I'll do it,
but only for the attention.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.049
Yes!

14:13.185 --> 14:13.776
Is Lemon around?

14:13.919 --> 14:15.113
I haven't seen her, sir.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.448
Tell her I need her.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.386
I'll be on 12
the rest of the day.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.418
As a joke.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.757
Hey,
can you make the Teamsters

14:23.896 --> 14:25.693
tell us where they get
those sandwiches?

14:25.831 --> 14:28.026
Only if you beat them
in a drinking contest.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.465
It's in their contract.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.037
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover?

14:33.172 --> 14:35.140
I'm a child, I'm a...?

14:35.274 --> 14:36.764
Mother!

14:36.909 --> 14:37.773
Floyd?

14:37.910 --> 14:40.435
Oh, boy.
Oh, no.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.240
Why aren't you at the airport,
Floyd?

14:42.381 --> 14:45.214
There was no flight,
was there?

14:45.351 --> 14:46.375
Not at the time, no.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.145
But I do have one tonight,
so...

14:48.287 --> 14:49.276
You lied to me.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.787
I just didn't want to talk
about that stuff.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.222
Can't we just fast-forward
to being friends again?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.850
You know...

14:55.995 --> 14:56.859
Ow!

14:56.996 --> 14:59.260
Your cellphone was dead.
You faked that e-mail.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.458
Peter Venkman...
That's from "Ghostbusters"!

15:02.601 --> 15:04.330
You used "Ghostbusters"
for evil!

15:04.470 --> 15:06.768
I'm glad we didn't talk
about that girl,

15:06.906 --> 15:07.838
because you're a liar.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.305
Okay. Okay, fine.
You want some honesty?

15:10.442 --> 15:12.569
I don't know what girl
you're talking about, Liz.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.737
I'm single. I'm a lawyer.
I wear nice coats.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.906
I'm the Michael Clayton
of Cleveland.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.642
Well,
I hope your car blows up.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.650
You made a choice.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.779
I asked you to come to Cleveland
with me, you... you nut job.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.256
I'll move to Cleveland
when you get that Ikea.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.291
Never!

15:28.427 --> 15:29.451
Oh, you...

15:29.595 --> 15:32.860
Don't you deprive the good
people of Cleveland an Ikea!

15:32.998 --> 15:35.228
You are vindictive,
Liz Lemon!

15:39.305 --> 15:40.602
Smooth.

15:40.739 --> 15:43.537
Oh, come on, you guys.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.008
You guys do one.
I've had 10 shots.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.635
You've only had five shots.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.442
No, today.
I've had 10 shots today.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.311
You fought a hell
of a good fight, Blondie,

15:52.451 --> 15:53.975
but you can't win.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.279
We failed.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.181
Hey, I found my lucky penny.
It's not in my ear.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.791
Battery's dead.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.022
I got a half-hour
before they track me down.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.154
Alcohol?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.665
This smells
just like Hill People Milk.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.532
I've been drinking this
since I was a baby!

16:14.907 --> 16:16.499
Mmm!

16:16.642 --> 16:17.540
It's on, y'all.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.007
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

16:20.546 --> 16:22.036
Oh, boy.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.884
How'd they do that?

16:32.024 --> 16:34.959
I'll be here?

16:35.094 --> 16:40.657
In sunshine or in shadow?

16:40.799 --> 16:44.257
Oh, Danny boy?

16:45.671 --> 16:48.435
So, should I ask why you're
showing up for work at 6:30?

16:48.574 --> 16:50.064
I'm not gonna lie to you,
Jack.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.007
I was working from home.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.169
Lemon, we should talk.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.177
Fine.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.043
Floyd was in town,
and it was awful.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.377
And it started out great
and then it was awful

16:59.518 --> 17:00.382
and now it's over.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.611
What happened?

17:01.754 --> 17:03.949
He lied
about going to the airport.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.255
And?

17:06.392 --> 17:08.791
And I said I hope he dies
in a car explosion.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.896
Lemon, life is
about minimizing regrets.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.865
You never know when someone's
going to slip into a coma

17:16.001 --> 17:18.026
and leave you regretting
all the things you didn't say

17:18.170 --> 17:21.230
or get in writing
from the company's lawyers.

17:21.373 --> 17:25.241
What I'm trying to say
is you're... young

17:25.377 --> 17:27.845
and you still haven't blown it
completely,

17:27.980 --> 17:31.472
so don't... start now.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.381
Ugh.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.920
I hate going to the airport.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.820
Floyd! Floyd!

17:43.962 --> 17:45.293
Oh. Sorry.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.696
I need the cheapest ticket
you have going anywhere.

17:52.771 --> 17:53.863
Ugh!

17:57.709 --> 17:59.006
What's that in your bag?

17:59.144 --> 18:02.136
Uh, a sandwich
and... dipping sauce.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.805
Unh-unh.
That's more than 3 ounces.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.348
You can't bring that
past here.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.974
Really?
Mm-hmm.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.950
No, look, I just need
to catch up with this guy

18:09.088 --> 18:10.521
before he gets on a plane
to Cleveland.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.317
That's sort of a cliché.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.686
You're sort of a cliché.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.987
One-way ticket to Montreal?

18:16.128 --> 18:16.992
Crazy eyes.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.029
I should detain you.

18:19.164 --> 18:20.495
Please, I just need
to talk to him

18:20.632 --> 18:22.623
before he takes off and I
never get the chance again.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.498
Fine. Just leave the sandwich
and go through!

18:25.637 --> 18:27.298
Leave the sandwich?

18:28.974 --> 18:30.498
Leave the sandwich?

18:30.642 --> 18:33.338
<i>Final boarding call

18:36.849 --> 18:38.840
You're choosing a sandwich
over a guy.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.714
Hmm.
That is less clichéd.

18:41.854 --> 18:42.821
I can do it.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.014
I can have it all!

19:01.273 --> 19:04.265
God, lady,
you're eating foil!

19:11.550 --> 19:12.414
Liz.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.848
What are you doing here?

19:13.986 --> 19:14.884
I don't want your car
to explode

19:15.020 --> 19:16.180
and I don't want you
to go into a coma

19:16.321 --> 19:19.017
and I don't want to stab you
in the face with a giant fork.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.147
What?

19:20.292 --> 19:21.190
Oh, that's not you.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.884
I've been threatening
a lot of people lately.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.258
Look, Liz, I'm... I'm really
sorry about what happened,

19:25.397 --> 19:26.261
you know?

19:26.398 --> 19:28.923
Are we at the part where we just
become friends again?

19:29.067 --> 19:30.557

didn't I?

19:30.702 --> 19:32.932
And I wolfed my Teamster sub
for you.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.164
Wait, no.
