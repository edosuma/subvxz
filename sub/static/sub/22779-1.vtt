25:35.784 --> 25:37.994
none of you well-meaning souls...

25:39.329 --> 25:40.413
take him in.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.043
Unless you want to suffer...

25:46.628 --> 25:49.005
like our Lord Jesus suffered
for all of us.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.823
Just like to know
who's lying here in my barn.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.663
You can't stay here much longer.

29:51.956 --> 29:55.418
I don't have enough to feed you,
and even if I did, I don't know you.

29:57.378 --> 30:00.006
So as soon as you're well enough,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.264
You're lucky there wasn't
more of a moon the other night.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.205
Must have been hard for Roy
to put him down like that.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.166
He couldn't have gotten far on foot.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.418
Except he ain't on foot.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.088

He knew there ain't no way
to track him over the rocks.

He's got at least a three-day head start.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.859
[Frank] So?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.027
So...

31:06.030 --> 31:08.908
he could have headed south
to the Gunnison River and crossed.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.911
Or, if he was smart,
rode right down the middle...

31:12.203 --> 31:15.206
seeing as it's shallow and sandy
all the way to New Mexico.

31:17.917 --> 31:18.918
[Frank] Or?

31:20.545 --> 31:22.755
He could have headed north
to the Purgatoire,

31:22.839 --> 31:24.966
followed it for a bit to lose any trail,

31:25.049 --> 31:27.093
then turned and headed up into Wyoming.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.180
He could have even circled around
and gone east.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.187
It's any man's guess which way he chose.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.152

40:21.252 --> 40:24.213
There's some lore about finding gold
under the fence posts.

40:25.005 --> 40:28.926
They say that's where the old ranchers
used to hide it from Indians and outlaws.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.387
Of course, I've never found any myself.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.764

Do you mind my asking...

40:40.438 --> 40:41.689
...how you three...

40:42.523 --> 40:44.066
ended up in this place?

40:44.942 --> 40:45.943
Well...

40:47.111 --> 40:48.237
it's a bit of a story.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.871
I was only 17...

40:57.663 --> 41:01.167
and I came out here to marry
the son of my father's business partner.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.045
All I knew about him
was that his name was Henry...

41:05.880 --> 41:08.048
and he was to meet me
at the train station.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.511
He'd sent me a new dress...

41:12.595 --> 41:14.555
yellow, so I'd stand out...

41:15.598 --> 41:18.476
and told me to wear it
the day I arrived so he'd know me.

41:20.478 --> 41:24.190
On the way back from the station, Henry
wants to take a ride around the property,

41:24.273 --> 41:25.483
show off his land.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.235
"Our land," he said.

41:30.779 --> 41:34.325
After a while, the horse pulling the buggy
starts getting antsy.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.496
I look up and see this strange cloud.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.707
Black with green around the edges.

41:43.834 --> 41:46.504
Henry says,
"Looks like we got a bit of rain coming."

41:47.630 --> 41:49.798
Next thing I knew, the cloud was gone.

41:50.758 --> 41:51.842
Just vanished.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.096
Now the horse starts to rear
in the traces.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.850
Henry helps me out of the wagon
when I hear a rumble.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.146
I turn around and see a six-foot wall
of water coming right at us.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.650
Henry, the horse,

42:07.733 --> 42:08.734
the buggy...

42:09.902 --> 42:12.363
they all got washed away
right in front of me.

42:15.491 --> 42:19.411
I almost did, too, but my new yellow dress
got hung up on some mesquite.

42:21.830 --> 42:22.998
Saved my life.

42:27.753 --> 42:31.382
I wandered off for eight days
in the wrong direction before I was found.

42:32.466 --> 42:33.300
Found?

42:34.468 --> 42:35.469
By who?

42:37.888 --> 42:39.181
That's another story.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.813
I'd offer to wash your clothes,

42:45.896 --> 42:48.065
but they look like they'd come apart
in the creek.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.445
My husband's stuff should fit you.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.781

44:26.330 --> 44:27.331
Miss Dunne,

44:27.414 --> 44:29.750
if I'd had me a teacher pretty as you,

44:29.833 --> 44:32.503
I don't think
I'd have learned a darn thing.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.254
Oh, I don't know, Marshal.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.340
I can be pretty persuasive.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.008
I have not doubt.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.178
I'm looking for Sheriff McNue.

44:57.820 --> 44:58.821
No, no, no, no.

45:01.281 --> 45:02.282
No, uh...

45:03.617 --> 45:04.618

45:05.786 --> 45:08.122
Well, look at you, McNue...

45:08.205 --> 45:10.624

45:11.834 --> 45:15.212
Well, you ain't exactly covered
with morning dew yourself, Marshal.

45:15.712 --> 45:18.382
I recall you was always
more of a checkers man.

45:18.966 --> 45:22.052
You gonna swallow that squirrel,
or just keep chewing on him?

45:23.679 --> 45:26.682
I'm emulating old Jacob Lee from Abilene.

45:27.182 --> 45:28.809
[mutters] Oh, Jesus.

45:28.892 --> 45:32.104
One of  the  great fornicators of all time.

45:33.355 --> 45:37.317
He also had himself
a finely groomed patch of facial hair,

45:37.401 --> 45:39.945
I hear served all sorts of purpose.

45:40.028 --> 45:43.824
The man also had himself a pecker
weighed as much as his .45.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.662

45:49.580 --> 45:51.457
[chuckles] And of your mustache.

45:51.540 --> 45:54.168
A man needs something to proceed hisself,

45:54.251 --> 45:55.961
other than mere rumor.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.131
How are you, Bill?

46:00.340 --> 46:02.426
You being a good mama to them little ones?

46:02.509 --> 46:05.637
Are you kidding?
Around here they got 100 mamas.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.848
[thunder rumbles]

46:09.183 --> 46:12.019
So, John,
what brings you all the way out here?

46:12.519 --> 46:14.438
Besides interrupting my leisure time.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.150
I'm looking for Frank Griffin.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.445
You think he might be here?

46:22.779 --> 46:25.365
There's a regiment up in Olegrande.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.992
I'm on my way up there...

46:27.868 --> 46:29.870
to see if the captain will help me out.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.331
You're... You're going to the army?

46:32.414 --> 46:35.375
Ain't no regular posse
will go after him no more.

46:36.210 --> 46:39.171
Not after they seen
what he left behind in Creede.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.298
What happened up there?

46:41.798 --> 46:42.883
Jesus, Bill.

46:43.675 --> 46:45.761
Ain't you been reading  The Daily Review?

46:47.471 --> 46:49.723
I don't read much of anything these days.

46:49.806 --> 46:54.394
Well, that A.T. Grigg
is selling papers like bullets.

46:54.978 --> 46:58.440
Griffin's been hitting mines
all over the territory

46:58.524 --> 47:00.317
the last six, seven months.

47:02.778 --> 47:03.779
Lately, though...

47:04.738 --> 47:07.699
he's run himself
into some kind of a problem...

47:08.867 --> 47:11.119
goes by the name of Roy Goode.

47:11.703 --> 47:12.829
Boy from Moses?

47:12.913 --> 47:15.582
That boy was a dead gun at 16.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.584
[marshal] That's the one.

47:18.293 --> 47:19.711
But he's not a boy no more.

47:20.546 --> 47:21.755
He's all growed up.

47:22.631 --> 47:25.842
Been riding with Griffin
for at least a dozen years,

47:25.926 --> 47:28.220
until he disappeared a while back.

47:28.971 --> 47:31.974
Word was Goode drowned six months ago

47:32.057 --> 47:33.517
trying to cross Harlin Creek.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.311
But then he showed up
at Griffin's last robbery.

47:36.853 --> 47:38.689
What do you mean, "showed up"?

47:39.273 --> 47:41.024
Stole the whole take.

47:41.108 --> 47:43.151
About $50,000 worth.

47:45.028 --> 47:46.029
Goddamn.

47:46.905 --> 47:49.658
Grigg has taken
to calling him "Robin Goode"...

47:50.784 --> 47:53.120
even though he stole from the crooked

47:53.203 --> 47:55.581
and ain't gave a dime so far to nobody.

47:56.415 --> 47:57.249
Hm.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.918
And you say this was where again?

48:00.252 --> 48:01.336
Up in Creede.

48:03.255 --> 48:05.465
Griffin hit the Tomboy Mine up there.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.927
Payroll comes into town

48:09.011 --> 48:11.221
on this little narrow gauge...

48:11.805 --> 48:13.599
spurs off Savage Basin.

48:45.380 --> 48:47.007
[metal screeching]

48:47.883 --> 48:49.092
[passengers screaming]

49:04.566 --> 49:07.069
[marshal]
Weren't just no ordinary train, neither.

49:07.152 --> 49:09.738
Turns out, aboard was J.B. Sloan,

49:09.821 --> 49:13.408
president of the outfit
that holds the claim on the Tomboy.

49:14.701 --> 49:17.287
The man travels with his own security.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.084
But that didn't matter much.

49:30.926 --> 49:33.512
What in the good holy hell's
going on here?

49:33.595 --> 49:34.596
Hey, there.

49:36.056 --> 49:38.141
Suppose you tell us
where the payroll's at,

49:38.225 --> 49:39.685
save us all some time?

49:40.602 --> 49:43.480
Do you boys have
any goddamned idea who I am?

49:44.523 --> 49:45.524
[woman screams]

49:51.446 --> 49:53.198
I know you were Jimmy Sloan.

49:54.157 --> 49:58.036
And I don't appreciate you using
the Lord's name in vain as such.

49:58.370 --> 49:59.496
Everyone, outside!

49:59.996 --> 50:01.998
[heavy breathing]

50:03.208 --> 50:04.501
Look at you.

50:04.584 --> 50:05.752
My, oh, my!

50:06.795 --> 50:08.422
[woman screams]

50:08.505 --> 50:09.589
[man grunts]

50:14.052 --> 50:14.886
Come on!

50:24.479 --> 50:26.940
[marshal]
Maybe he was there waiting all along.

50:27.023 --> 50:28.191
Hurry it up!

50:28.275 --> 50:29.901
Maybe he come later.

50:30.527 --> 50:31.987
Hard to say,

50:32.070 --> 50:33.864
as I only got the one witness.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.199
And given what they done to her...

50:37.242 --> 50:39.453
I don't know how reliable she was.

50:39.995 --> 50:41.496
[laughter]

50:41.580 --> 50:43.415
But she said they called him Roy...

50:44.541 --> 50:46.376
and that they was all afraid of him.

50:55.469 --> 50:56.303
Shh.

51:01.850 --> 51:03.101
[Frank] Roy Goode!

51:12.360 --> 51:13.445
Why are you doing this?

51:13.528 --> 51:14.613
Ride out, Frank.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.364
What all got you so mad at me?

51:18.700 --> 51:20.202
Damn it, I raised you up, Roy.

51:20.285 --> 51:22.662
Ride on out
or I take your fucking head off.

51:23.955 --> 51:25.207
This ain't my death.

51:32.088 --> 51:33.048
[whistles]

51:36.468 --> 51:37.469
Roy!

51:42.140 --> 51:43.767
[hollering]

51:50.565 --> 51:52.984
[marshal] While Frank ran after Roy
and his money,

51:53.068 --> 51:55.779
the miners finally came up
from the Tomboy.

51:55.862 --> 51:57.489
[men hollering]

52:02.244 --> 52:03.703
Where is everybody?

52:03.787 --> 52:05.205
[man] They's right here.

52:06.623 --> 52:08.625
[guns cocking]

52:10.752 --> 52:13.922
Town sent word
they had a couple of Griffin's boys,

52:14.005 --> 52:16.716
so I put a posse together
and headed up that way.

52:18.426 --> 52:21.179
A couple of things happened
while I was en route.

52:21.263 --> 52:22.681
[grunting]

52:25.433 --> 52:29.980
First, the good people of Creede
decided to lynch the Devlin Twins.

52:30.564 --> 52:31.565
Now...

52:32.399 --> 52:34.776
which one wants to watch
the other get hung first?

52:34.860 --> 52:36.069
I'll go first, brother.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.865
The second thing...

52:39.948 --> 52:43.410
Frank Griffin decided to turn around
and come back.

52:43.493 --> 52:44.911
You folks want a lynching?

52:45.829 --> 52:47.205
You got one!

52:47.289 --> 52:49.291
[screaming and gunfire]

52:54.045 --> 52:56.256
Whatever it was turned him around...

52:57.132 --> 52:59.134
it seems that sometime during the chase,

52:59.217 --> 53:01.553
Roy'd put a bullet in Frank's arm.

53:10.478 --> 53:11.980
[marshal]  Them sons of bitches...

53:12.731 --> 53:14.774
lynched the damn mob.

53:17.903 --> 53:19.905
[screaming]

53:20.530 --> 53:21.656
[gunshot]

53:21.740 --> 53:23.533
[woman screams]

53:24.200 --> 53:25.827
Every last one of them.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.537
[screaming]

53:29.539 --> 53:30.540
[glass shatters]

53:31.666 --> 53:34.377
Then he burned the whole town
to the ground.

54:03.406 --> 54:05.033
[panting]

54:09.204 --> 54:10.372
Their blossom...

54:11.081 --> 54:12.624
shall go up as dust...

54:15.043 --> 54:18.588
because they have cast away
the law of the Lord.

54:25.011 --> 54:27.263
I come riding through the next morning.

54:29.432 --> 54:31.434

54:39.109 --> 54:40.735
[marshal]  Tears come to my eyes.

54:43.488 --> 54:45.740
I just couldn't reckon with it.

54:48.243 --> 54:52.747
They've been robbing mines
all over Colorado and Wyoming.

54:52.831 --> 54:55.542
It's only a matter of time
before they come this way.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.294
But we're shut down.

54:58.378 --> 55:00.588
Frank Griffin don't know that.

55:01.673 --> 55:04.801
And when he finds out
who all's mostly living here...

55:06.136 --> 55:08.847
that ain't exactly gonna be
a discouragement.

55:11.891 --> 55:13.727

Like I said, he knows horses.

57:49.007 --> 57:50.800
Glass of bonded, you got any.

58:03.563 --> 58:07.317
My daddy always said it was bad luck
to spill even a drop of fine whiskey.

58:10.403 --> 58:12.363
Certainly explains things around here.

58:13.490 --> 58:16.034
It ain't spilled whiskey
causing all  our  problems.

58:16.534 --> 58:19.954
It's that damn Fletcher witch
cursed this place.

58:22.290 --> 58:23.500
[glass placed down]

58:24.709 --> 58:26.294
Too much coal dust in the shaft.

58:27.045 --> 58:29.714
It ignited
and the fire just drunk up all the air.

58:30.215 --> 58:33.343
Eighty-three good men gone
in less than five minutes.

58:34.552 --> 58:36.137
Just plain old bad luck.

58:43.311 --> 58:46.105
Outside of the sheriff
and that boy deputy,

58:46.189 --> 58:48.775
how many folks left around here
can fire a gun?

58:49.359 --> 58:50.193
Why?

58:51.444 --> 58:52.987
Is there gonna be trouble?

58:54.197 --> 58:55.823
Just asking, that's all.

58:55.907 --> 58:57.951
Well, if there's trouble,

58:58.034 --> 59:00.036
the sheriff ain't gonna be around, anyhow.

59:00.954 --> 59:02.747
But his sister can sure shoot.

59:02.830 --> 59:04.249

-[McNue] How are you doing, son?
-I'm good.

59:38.324 --> 59:40.326
Yeah? Let me look at you.

59:44.789 --> 59:46.249
[McNue] Afternoon, Miss Fletcher.

59:46.874 --> 59:47.875
[Alice] Sheriff.

59:49.502 --> 59:51.087
How is that well coming, son?

59:51.170 --> 59:52.255
It's getting there.

59:52.922 --> 59:56.342
If he spent more time digging down there
and less time pondering the universe,

59:56.426 --> 59:57.802
we'd have water by now.

1:00:03.016 --> 1:00:05.685
Truckee, why don't you take
the sheriff's horse?

1:00:16.404 --> 1:00:19.073
There was bloody business up north
with Frank Griffin.

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:21.075
What sort of bloody business?

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.828
Well, Griffin robbed
the Tomboy Mine in Creede.

1:00:24.495 --> 1:00:26.456
He ended up killing everyone in town.

1:00:27.373 --> 1:00:28.541
My God.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:31.461
Yeah, he and one of his boys
got into it over the money.

1:00:31.711 --> 1:00:34.464
Now Griffin's tearing up the territory
looking for him.

1:00:35.173 --> 1:00:36.507
A fella named Roy Goode.

1:00:42.055 --> 1:00:43.056
Let's go inside.

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:54.192
You've got quite the herd
out there, Alice.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:56.819
A gift from Narrienta.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:58.696
A gift or a bribe?

1:00:59.614 --> 1:01:02.283
His other son
just lost his wife to rubella.

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:04.118
Tell me more about this Roy Goode.

1:01:05.244 --> 1:01:07.246
What are you planning on doing
with all of them?

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:10.375
I've been talking
to some ex-buffalo soldiers,

1:01:10.458 --> 1:01:12.710
having a go at their own town
outside Easton.

1:01:12.794 --> 1:01:14.045
You mean Blackdom?

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:17.173
That's more a few sod huts
than any kind of town.

1:01:17.256 --> 1:01:19.092
You sure them folks got the money?

1:01:19.175 --> 1:01:20.301
They say they do.

1:01:20.968 --> 1:01:23.388
I see them doing odd jobs
in town sometimes.

1:01:25.348 --> 1:01:27.308
What all you know about this Roy Goode?

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:31.396
Well, Marshal in Santa Fe
tells me he killed at least a dozen men.

1:01:34.649 --> 1:01:35.483
Listen...

1:01:36.317 --> 1:01:38.236
I was thinking it might be a nice gesture

1:01:38.319 --> 1:01:41.656
if you sold a few of them animals
to the ladies down in La Belle.

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:43.533
Nice gesture?

1:01:44.242 --> 1:01:45.827
They shot my husband in the back.

1:01:45.910 --> 1:01:47.453
Well, you don't know that.

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:49.664
I know they left him in the mud to die.

1:01:49.747 --> 1:01:51.749
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.

1:01:52.458 --> 1:01:54.711
They've all had
their own heartache since then.

1:01:55.503 --> 1:01:58.047
You know, maybe it's time
y'all buried the hatchet.

1:01:58.131 --> 1:02:01.092
Hell, maybe it's time we all moved on.

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:04.804
Truth is...

1:02:06.514 --> 1:02:08.975
I come down here
to talk to you about just that.

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:10.810
The future.

1:02:12.145 --> 1:02:13.896
I don't say this to you now,

1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:14.981
I never will.

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:21.404
It seems Anna's been coming to me
in my dreams less and less.

1:02:23.406 --> 1:02:26.617
I can't tell if it's because
she's fading away from me or...

1:02:29.912 --> 1:02:31.998
because I see you there more and more.

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:36.043
Alice...

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:39.547
I need to know where I stand with you.

1:02:47.764 --> 1:02:49.182
I'm being foolish, ain't I?

1:02:49.265 --> 1:02:50.266
No, you're not.

1:02:50.349 --> 1:02:53.728
It's all right. Ain't the first time
the wish was feather to the thought.

1:02:53.811 --> 1:02:54.979
[footsteps]

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:57.273
[hoarse] Excuse me, ma'am.

1:02:58.941 --> 1:03:00.109
Are you the local law?

1:03:02.695 --> 1:03:03.946
Yes, sir, I am.

1:03:05.156 --> 1:03:07.241
I'm Roy Goode, sir.

1:03:09.827 --> 1:03:12.747
And if it's all right with you,
I'd like to turn myself in.

1:03:12.830 --> 1:03:14.916
I knew it! I knew you were somebody!

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:17.001
Truckee, stay outside.

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:18.169
What? Why can't I--

1:03:18.252 --> 1:03:19.295
Go!

1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.013
You're Roy Goode?

1:03:30.431 --> 1:03:31.474
Yes, sir.

1:03:32.225 --> 1:03:33.059
Ma'am...

1:03:34.352 --> 1:03:36.312
we may need to borrow your mare,

1:03:36.395 --> 1:03:39.440
or even the old lady's burro, seeing as
the little packhorse I rode in on--

1:03:39.524 --> 1:03:42.109
Just wait. Just wait a minute, goddamn it.

1:03:45.196 --> 1:03:48.366
Suppose you start by telling me
exactly what all you're doing right here?

1:03:48.449 --> 1:03:51.118
He showed up in the middle of the night,
about a week ago.

1:03:51.202 --> 1:03:52.411
A week ago?

1:03:53.287 --> 1:03:56.874
-And when was you planning on telling me?
-She didn't know who I was.

1:03:56.958 --> 1:03:57.959
Speak up, son.

1:03:58.042 --> 1:03:59.168
[clears throat]

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:03.381
She didn't know who I was.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.634
Why are you talking all soft for?

1:04:07.218 --> 1:04:10.429
Ma shot him in the throat,
but he'd already been shot two times.

1:04:14.225 --> 1:04:17.186
I got into it with Griffin and his boys

1:04:17.270 --> 1:04:19.063
at a place called Doubtful Canyon.

1:04:19.146 --> 1:04:20.648
I don't believe I've heard of it.

1:04:20.731 --> 1:04:24.402
It's up north in Colorado,
a few miles outside a town called Creede.

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:27.071
Frank had just robbed the payroll.

1:04:27.572 --> 1:04:29.699
I went ahead and took it from him.

1:04:29.782 --> 1:04:33.119
-And why would you do a thing like that?
-Because I knew he'd chase me.

1:04:33.911 --> 1:04:37.456
I was trying to draw them as far away
from the folks in that town as I could.

1:04:39.125 --> 1:04:41.836
But things didn't quite work out
the way I planned.

1:04:41.919 --> 1:04:43.129
I'd say not.

1:04:43.963 --> 1:04:44.964
What happened?

1:04:45.047 --> 1:04:48.926
Well, I seen from my horse's mouth
he was flecking blood.

1:04:49.510 --> 1:04:51.012
Began to flounder.

1:04:51.095 --> 1:04:53.723
I could see the poor boy
didn't have much life left.

1:04:55.725 --> 1:04:57.560
It weren't long before he bottomed out--

1:04:57.643 --> 1:05:00.396
I didn't ask you what happened
with your damn horse.

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:03.983
I asked you, "What happened?"

1:05:04.567 --> 1:05:05.568
Oh, well...

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:08.863
we ended up shooting it out in the canyon.

1:05:10.156 --> 1:05:11.490
You against all of them?

1:05:11.574 --> 1:05:12.658
[Roy] Yes, sir.

1:05:14.118 --> 1:05:16.829
Boy, Griffin's got 30 men riding with him.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.372
Thirty-two that day.

1:05:18.456 --> 1:05:20.791
And you held them all off by yourself?

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:24.879
Sir, a situation like that,
a rifle can be mighty comprehensive.

1:05:24.962 --> 1:05:25.963
[McNue] Still...

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:28.716
there was 32 of them and just one of you.

1:05:29.508 --> 1:05:30.593
[clears throat]

1:05:30.676 --> 1:05:33.429
I knew there was no way
they were gonna work through that gorge,

1:05:33.512 --> 1:05:34.764
boxed up the way it was,

1:05:34.847 --> 1:05:36.349
without getting shot to a man.

1:05:37.892 --> 1:05:42.104
And that black-handled .38 I hear
so much about... where might that be?

1:05:42.188 --> 1:05:43.189
I lost it...

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:46.192
and my rifle, crossing the San Juan.

1:05:46.275 --> 1:05:49.528
And that cash you stole from Griffin,
you lose that in the river, too?

1:05:49.612 --> 1:05:50.988
I lost everything.

1:05:53.157 --> 1:05:56.410
You know, you don't seem all that much
like a desperado to me

1:05:56.494 --> 1:05:58.329
so much as you just look desperate.

1:06:01.332 --> 1:06:02.750
I am who I say.

1:06:03.501 --> 1:06:05.753
[McNue] Well, if that is true, son,

1:06:05.836 --> 1:06:07.254
if you are Roy Goode...

1:06:09.215 --> 1:06:10.925
they're gonna hang you for sure.

1:06:32.697 --> 1:06:33.781
Goodbye, Mr. Goode.

1:07:26.959 --> 1:07:28.169
[sighs]

1:07:31.047 --> 1:07:32.506
God help you folks.

1:07:57.782 --> 1:07:59.784
[whinnying]
