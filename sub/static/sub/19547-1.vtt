Miles!

02:52.605 --> 02:53.705
Breakfast!

02:56.643 --> 02:57.676
Your alarm!

03:11.524 --> 03:12.958
Don't piss me off!

03:23.804 --> 03:24.804
Coming!

03:33.746 --> 03:35.714
Hey there, easy on that stuff.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.782
It's fine.

03:37.517 --> 03:40.085
You all set for today?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.653
Senior year!

03:42.488 --> 03:44.323
Last time you get to say that.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.225
Until college.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.527
The only people who
care about senior year

03:47.528 --> 03:49.695
are gonna live here
forever anyways.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.662
So what's the big deal?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.165
You don't know that.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.167
I can't wait to be in Chicago.

03:55.169 --> 03:58.503
Well, how do you plan
on getting to Chicago?

03:58.505 --> 04:00.372
We don't need to talk
about this right now.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.206
Okay, but I'm
definitely going to

04:01.208 --> 04:03.542
Columbia college in Chicago.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.277
It's a really good film school.

04:05.279 --> 04:08.847
How 'bout when you need
a real job after school?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.515
I'll get one in film.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.516
Besides...

04:11.518 --> 04:12.852
we don't wanna be
late today sweetie pie.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.387
There's a campus tour
in Chicago next month

04:14.388 --> 04:16.421
and you'll see how cool it is.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.724
Just not on a school
night sweetheart.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.192
Yeah, Chicago's
three hours away.

04:20.194 --> 04:21.692
I ain't driving that.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.461
Why not?

04:22.463 --> 04:23.528
If I were you,

04:23.530 --> 04:25.230
I'd be thinking
more along the lines

04:25.232 --> 04:28.567
of Springfield
community college.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.036
We're having meatloaf tonight.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.972
Will you be
joining us this time?

04:37.745 --> 04:38.777
You ready?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.747
I just need my backpack.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.582
Done?

04:52.393 --> 04:53.725
Keys.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.727
Let's go.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.517
Have a good first day.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.651
You too.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.523
Ah, welcome back miles.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.590
Thanks.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.295
Are you our av guy
again this year?

05:30.297 --> 05:33.632
All right, the next
Steven Spielberg.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.200
Don't forget about
the little people.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.602
You got it.

05:44.277 --> 05:47.312
Okay quiet down everybody.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.313
Good morning.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.616
As you all know my
name is Mrs. Walton.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.552
Welcome to senior English.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.554
I hope that you all
enjoyed your break

05:55.556 --> 05:58.390
and that you are ready
and raring to learn!

05:58.392 --> 05:59.458
'Cause I sure am.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.693
Let's get started with role.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.420
"Miller in the morning"
with me, Scott Miller.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.622
Cathy Voltmer is over there,

07:03.624 --> 07:05.290
happy Saturday morning to you.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.892
Big ticket giveaway coming up.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.460
If you're into trucks I have

07:08.462 --> 07:10.061
the perfect thing for you.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.029
We're giving away

07:11.031 --> 07:12.097
a pair of tickets

07:12.099 --> 07:14.566
to the 37th annual
Midwest truck show

07:14.568 --> 07:17.269
being held at the prairie
capital convention center

07:17.271 --> 07:20.038
here in Springfield...

07:20.040 --> 07:22.140
Ron?!

07:24.945 --> 07:25.945
You okay?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.613
Oh no!

07:28.615 --> 07:29.615
Oh my god!

07:32.452 --> 07:33.418
Are you Pam Walton?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.620
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.554
Hi, I'm Dr. Meade.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.755
Oh good.

07:36.757 --> 07:40.625
Our EMT's worked on
Ron at your residence.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.893
Then I tried myself,

07:41.895 --> 07:43.895
but as far as we could tell,

07:43.897 --> 07:46.565
he was gone before he got here.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.100
We did all we could
for him Mrs. Walton.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.301
I'm so sorry.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.636
That can't be.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.573
He has an upper
respiratory infection.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.241
We were just at the
doctor last week,

07:56.243 --> 07:57.609
he's taking medication for it

07:57.611 --> 07:59.744
and he said he's
feeling so good.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.314
Well we think that a hole
had formed in his heart

08:02.316 --> 08:05.250
which slowly filled the
lining up with blood.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.586
And when it got too
full it just burst.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.422
Can you check the files?

08:10.424 --> 08:11.590
For what?

08:11.592 --> 08:12.925
Well maybe you could
call Dr. Spalding's office

08:12.926 --> 08:15.694
and they can send you their
reports of what we all...

08:15.696 --> 08:16.761
mom.

08:16.763 --> 08:17.629
Discussed last Tuesday...

08:17.631 --> 08:18.597
mom.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.764
To the x-rays.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.767
He just said dad's
heart exploded.

08:22.769 --> 08:23.769
He's dead.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.304
I'll give you folks a minute.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.606
What?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.541
He's dead, mom.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.480
It's okay.

08:36.282 --> 08:40.217
Ron is remembered by
his loving wife, Pamela,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.523
of 23 years.

08:44.525 --> 08:48.627
He is remembered by his
talented son, miles.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.565
By grateful friends
and relatives.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.203
This is a very hard
day for us here.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.405
Every one of us gathered today

09:00.407 --> 09:01.706
has been touched by Ron

09:01.708 --> 09:03.575
in one way or another.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.871
Well that was a nice service.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.139
Yeah it was.

09:36.676 --> 09:40.412
It's funny how two
people change over time.

09:42.048 --> 09:45.684
Well I mean that he was so kind,

09:45.686 --> 09:47.519
and sweet, and caring.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.624
Your dad used to be so much fun.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.659
I was so in love with him.

09:58.230 --> 10:01.433
These changes,
they happen so slowly.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.703
And then one day you
wake up and you realize

10:04.705 --> 10:07.772
you're two totally
different people.

10:10.309 --> 10:12.944
Your dad just got
so controlling.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.814
He kept tightening
his grip on me.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.284
I felt so cut off.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.625
And I knew he was
fooling around on me.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.496
I guess you probably
knew it too, huh?

10:35.401 --> 10:36.569
You know I came
so close to asking

10:36.570 --> 10:38.503
your dad for a divorce.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.409
At least now we know the lying

10:44.411 --> 10:47.646
and the sneaking
around is finally over.

10:52.251 --> 10:55.754
I'm just so sorry he
wasn't nicer to you.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.973
You're gonna want seconds?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.174
Yes please.

11:42.068 --> 11:45.203
Welcome, you have mail.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.651
Mom?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.695
What the hell is all this noise?

14:26.899 --> 14:28.032
What's wrong?

14:30.069 --> 14:32.370
We don't have any money.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.473
What do you mean?

14:35.475 --> 14:38.710
I mean your dad
spent all our savings.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.647
There's supposed to
be $30,000 in here

14:42.649 --> 14:44.716
to pay for your college.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.057
He bought her that car.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.827
Oh my god.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.329
He never let me go
through the bank statements.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.529
He never let me do anything.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.733
He... your dad, he was in
charge of the money stuff

15:01.735 --> 15:03.434
and he just,

15:03.436 --> 15:06.504
he just... he blew it all.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.108
He blew it all.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.177
Mom, it's okay.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.754
I'm so sorry.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.056
I'm sorry.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.457
It's okay.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.627
It's okay.

15:50.716 --> 15:54.385
You don't have to go to school
today if you don't want to.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.454
Are you not going?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.122
I need a few days.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.093
Should I take dad's truck today?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.796
Oh that's okay, I'll drive you.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.409
Hey hon, thinking of you guys.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.244
Thanks.

16:58.617 --> 16:59.784
Can I help you?

16:59.786 --> 17:03.554
Yes you can, I'm Ron's wife,
is she here?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.556
- She ain't here.
- What do you want?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.558
When did he give it to her?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.726
What?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.795
The car, the corvette.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.531
My daughter got that car
a couple of months ago.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.367
Well guess what, I want it back.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.469
Well you ain't getting
it back, it was a gift.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.471
Let me tell you something,

17:19.570 --> 17:20.637
if I'm the one making
the payments on it

17:20.640 --> 17:22.707
and my son's college money
was used as a deposit,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.242
I consider it my car, okay?!

17:25.244 --> 17:27.045
Well it ain't yours, it's hers.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.247
Where is she? Is she upstairs?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.314
Why don't you go home, Pam?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.315
Don't you have a kid
you gotta take care of?

17:31.317 --> 17:32.651
I would like to talk
to Jennifer, please.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.019
Settle down, I told
ya she ain't here.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.922
Now I don't appreciate you
coming over here to bother us.

17:37.924 --> 17:38.856
Let me tell you something.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.024
I want that car.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.726
I swear to god, I will come over

17:41.728 --> 17:44.362
here with a tow truck and
I will take it myself!

17:44.364 --> 17:45.263
I want it back!

17:45.265 --> 17:46.097
It's my car!

17:46.099 --> 17:47.865
Do that and I'll call the police

17:47.867 --> 17:49.567
for trespassing and theft!

17:49.569 --> 17:51.502
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

17:51.504 --> 17:52.870
Making excuses
for your daughter!

17:52.872 --> 17:54.338
Breaking up a family!

17:54.340 --> 17:55.940
Your family was already broken.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.375
You're disgusting!

17:57.377 --> 18:01.012
You are going off the deep
end coming over here like this.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.548
That car is in Jennifer's name,
it's hers!

18:03.550 --> 18:04.749
Shame on you!

18:04.751 --> 18:05.583
You need some help!

18:05.585 --> 18:06.617
You need help!

18:06.619 --> 18:08.453
Get out of my face or
I'll call the police!

18:08.455 --> 18:10.388
I'll call the police on you!

18:10.390 --> 18:11.556
How dare...

18:11.558 --> 18:13.691
Hey, open the door!

18:18.931 --> 18:23.201
Hey miles, Mrs. Armstrong
is waiting to see you.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.636
It's good to see you back.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.638
Thanks.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.640
So how's everything at home?

18:29.642 --> 18:30.608
We're okay.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.977
Oh good, that's great.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.379
We're sure glad to
see you back, miles.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.881
Thanks, Mrs. Armstrong.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.750
So, what can I do for you?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.719
I'm here because I'm
looking for a new college.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.387
Oh, all right then.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.722
Tell me what you're thinking.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.391
Okay, I'm looking for
a school in Chicago.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.094
I wanted to do the film
program at Columbia college

18:50.096 --> 18:51.729
but it's too expensive.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.731
Right, right.

18:53.733 --> 18:58.269
Well it is an arts school.
Um...

18:58.271 --> 19:01.239
You know, Springfield community

19:01.241 --> 19:02.640
has a films studies program.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.742
And I hear the one at
Southern is quite good.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.778
Yeah, but it needs
to be in Chicago.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.647
I'm afraid if I
stay here one more

19:09.649 --> 19:12.750
day than I have to, I'll get
stuck here like everyone else.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.854
Oh, right.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.590
So is it too late
for scholarships?

19:19.592 --> 19:22.093
Well, I have a list.

19:22.095 --> 19:23.794
This is a pretty
common question.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.697
So I keep this list of
college scholarships

19:26.699 --> 19:28.266
that are available in Chicago.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.635
Why don't you have
a look at that?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.436
What's a national merit scholar?

19:32.438 --> 19:34.472
Oh, uh...

19:34.474 --> 19:37.441
You don't quite
qualify for that so,

19:37.443 --> 19:38.543
we should keep looking.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.610
Oh.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.548
Men's volleyball scholarship
to Loyola university.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.649
What's this?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.150
It's just what it says.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.119
Well that's in Chicago isn't it?

19:48.121 --> 19:51.455
Yes but you'd have to
be on the volleyball team.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.624
Then I'll get on
the team, I'm good.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.027
Sweetie, it's a girls' team.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.132
Well is there a law
saying that a boy

20:01.134 --> 20:02.800
can't play on a girls' team?

20:02.802 --> 20:05.203
You know, we did
have this come up

20:05.205 --> 20:08.739
with a girl in football
a few seasons ago.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.908
And because of title nine,
we let her play,

20:10.910 --> 20:15.479
but we never had a boy
wanna be on a girls' team.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.481
I mean...

20:17.649 --> 20:19.483
I'm just saying I think that

20:19.485 --> 20:21.052
maybe you should continue to

20:21.054 --> 20:23.054
look for other options.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.526
Yeah, you're probably right.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.627
Yeah.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.340
So, I'm gonna need you
to warm the girls up.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.608
Okay, start peppering...

20:43.610 --> 20:44.942
hey coach.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.877
Is it too late to tryout?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.179
For who, for you?

20:48.181 --> 20:50.047
Yeah I wanna play.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.250
Well this is a girls' team.

20:52.252 --> 20:56.454
Well if there's a boys' team
I'd be there.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.688
Come on, please?

20:59.625 --> 21:00.692
All right, well what the heck.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.393
Go suit up and be back in five.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.761
Okay.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.302
All right, ladies.

21:16.241 --> 21:21.212
Please don't expect any
favors or any free rides.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.547
This is a challenging sport.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.116
A little more energy,
that's right.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.317
Faster, faster!

21:26.319 --> 21:28.552
One that brings the
best out of my girls.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.888
Uh, all of my students.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.256
Higher, higher, higher!

21:32.258 --> 21:33.624
That's it, come on!

21:33.626 --> 21:35.726
Come on, Penelope, do it!

21:35.728 --> 21:39.397
I take this sport
very seriously,

21:39.399 --> 21:42.300
and I expect you
all will as well.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.567
A spot on this team

21:43.569 --> 21:46.404
does not come cheap.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.571
Ballet class.

21:47.573 --> 21:50.107
So if you've come to play,
I want you to play hard.

21:50.109 --> 21:54.912
But I also want you to
learn how to play well.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.580
This is where we see
what you're made of.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.983
This is where you bump
your distractions,

21:58.985 --> 22:02.119
set your targets,
and spike your goals.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.354
Not the worst I've seen.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.588
Nice work, keep it up.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.424
What are you doing
out there, Candace?

22:06.426 --> 22:08.092
If you make the cut,
your name will

22:08.094 --> 22:11.762
be posted outside my
office after tryouts.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.432
I want those butts lower,
lower, lower those butts.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.198
Lower.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.133
If your name is not on the list,

22:16.135 --> 22:17.268
that's it.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.570
No tears, no phone
calls from your parents.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.572
All right?

22:20.672 --> 22:23.774
I wish you the best of luck,
ladies... and miles!

22:35.620 --> 22:36.454
Yes!

22:36.456 --> 22:38.122
Awe snap!

22:38.124 --> 22:39.957
Love the enthusiasm.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.726
I'm sorry,
I didn't see you there.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.227
Most people don't.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.862
Oh, before you pop a chub,

22:44.864 --> 22:46.731
you should know that
everyone made the team.

22:46.733 --> 22:47.733
How do you know?

22:47.833 --> 22:50.368
Well eight people tried out,
eight people made the team.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.070
Six on the court, two
on the bench, duh.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.538
I'm miles, by the way.

22:55.140 --> 22:55.906
Penelope.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.376
Oh, but my friends call me P.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.546
You can call me P.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.547
Oh okay, um...

23:03.549 --> 23:05.483
ooh, parental release forms.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.485
Thanks, P.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.886
You got it, girl.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.345
Refill?

23:45.223 --> 23:47.691
Can you please just sign it?

23:51.396 --> 23:52.731
Why would you wanna
join a girl's team

23:52.732 --> 23:54.632
when there's so many boy sports.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.300
I like volleyball.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.472
Hey, I know the football coach.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.541
I bet he'd let
you be the kicker.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.741
Do you want me to ask him?

24:03.743 --> 24:06.310
No mom, that's okay just...

24:10.482 --> 24:11.882
I don't know honey,
with dad gone

24:11.884 --> 24:13.584
this sure seems
like a lot for you.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.219
Mom, that's why I wanna play.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.456
It's something to get
my mind off of him.

24:19.724 --> 24:20.724
Okay.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.726
It'll be fun, it's just a game.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.299
Here you go.

24:33.238 --> 24:34.071
Hey miles.

24:34.073 --> 24:34.805
Yeah.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.807
Tell everyone I'm doing okay.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.809
Okay.

24:42.113 --> 24:43.447
Okay.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.751
We want everyone in this room,

24:47.753 --> 24:50.621
in this school,
and in this town,

24:50.623 --> 24:52.523
coming out to support us.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.592
Let me hear you, Pondley high!

25:02.434 --> 25:05.703
Here is the moment you've
all been waiting for!

25:05.705 --> 25:07.271
Let me introduce you to the

25:07.273 --> 25:11.642
1999 girls varsity
volleyball team!

25:11.644 --> 25:13.110
Come on out!

25:24.456 --> 25:27.124
So come on out for our first
game of the season against...

25:27.126 --> 25:28.726
Walton's a fag!

25:28.728 --> 25:31.462
- Calvary high on...
- Who said that?

25:32.697 --> 25:34.532
Who said that?

25:34.534 --> 25:35.799
For that, Mr. Roberts,

25:35.801 --> 25:37.801
you can see me after.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.071
So yeah, come and support us.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.706
We'll see you next week.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.643
Hey, let's hear it for
the lady warriors huh?!

25:55.053 --> 25:57.922
So I went over there
and her delightful mother

25:57.924 --> 26:00.157
Rhonda answered the door.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.561
I felt like I was
talking to her bodyguard.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.930
And then, she had
the nerve to slam

26:05.932 --> 26:07.431
the door in my face right after

26:07.433 --> 26:09.567
she told me that I needed help.

26:09.569 --> 26:13.604
Can you imagine, like I'm the
crazy one in this situation?

26:15.106 --> 26:17.708
And now that Ron is dead,

26:17.710 --> 26:18.976
I just feel...

26:23.348 --> 26:24.748
I don't know,
I feel so pissed off

26:24.750 --> 26:27.585
that I'm the one left
holding the bag, you know?

26:27.587 --> 26:30.554
And apparently now I'm
the one who needs help.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.722
Why doesn't he need help?

26:31.724 --> 26:34.458
Why does Ron get off so easy?

26:34.460 --> 26:36.026
Dying is easy.

26:38.096 --> 26:41.098
I just think he should have
to pay for his mistakes.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.667
I feel so mad, it's not fair.

26:47.372 --> 26:48.372
Thank you.

26:48.675 --> 26:49.574
Pam?

26:49.575 --> 26:52.409
- Hi Pam, how ya doing?
- - Oh hi, Jean.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.411
I'm doing okay.

26:53.611 --> 26:56.413
So I got to thinking while
you were telling your story.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.916
And I think I figured
out what you need

26:58.918 --> 27:00.417
to make you feel better.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.952
It just hit me out of the blue.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.253
Oh yeah?

27:03.255 --> 27:05.055
W-what is that?

27:05.057 --> 27:08.626
You need to get
yourself some new d girl.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.729
I'm so sorry, what is that?

27:11.731 --> 27:12.796
Some dick.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.432
And I know what you're thinking.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.636
There goes Jean rambling
on about cock again.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.238
But trust me, it is
essential that you

27:21.240 --> 27:22.641
just go out and you
get yourself laid

27:22.642 --> 27:25.309
straight away after
your husband dies.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.646
While it's fresh, it still
feels like cheating.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.116
Jean, I just feel like

27:32.118 --> 27:33.752
we're around so many
people so it's very public.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.653
- Oh.
- I mean...

27:35.655 --> 27:38.522
Ricky and I practically
only did it in public.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.758
- Is that right?
- Like one time he just had me

27:40.760 --> 27:42.092
just going up against a wall.

27:42.094 --> 27:45.763
And I just accidentally
set off the fire alarm.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.131
Jean.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.932
We just kept
doing it right there

27:48.934 --> 27:50.534
in the indoor rain.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.468
Wow.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.771
- It was glorious.
- Huh.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.638
Yeah.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.541
I just thought you
needed to know.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.476
- Oh.
- Well thank you, Jean.

28:00.445 --> 28:03.814
I appreciate you giving
me that information.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.449
It's good to know.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.451
But listen, we're all
gonna go get a drink after.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.687
It's our little tradition,
you gotta come.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.523
Oh no, I can't, I wake up
early, I'm a school teacher.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.625
- No, you gotta get back in the saddle.
- I'm a teacher!

28:13.626 --> 28:14.391
Come on!

28:14.393 --> 28:15.292
Okay!

28:15.294 --> 28:17.361
Have a beer, one beer.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.303
Hey Brian, did you get it?

28:26.305 --> 28:27.137
You get the poster?

28:27.139 --> 28:28.005
Office space, right?

28:28.007 --> 28:29.139
Yeah.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.541
Okay here.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.210
Did you know the Swingline
stapler guy in the movie

28:32.211 --> 28:33.812
doesn't really talk
like that in real life?

28:33.813 --> 28:36.814
Yeah, on "newsradio"
he's totally different.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.649
Here, it's got his full name

28:38.651 --> 28:41.218
and the login for a
lexisnexis account okay?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.420
So you just run a search for him

28:42.421 --> 28:44.021
and it'll tell you
all sorts of stuff.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.090
Thanks, I owe you, man.

30:41.105 --> 30:43.607
Would you like to reconnect?

31:11.736 --> 31:13.203
Welcome.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.084
Know anything about me?

32:34.086 --> 32:34.952
Yeah.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.553
Anything bad?

32:51.236 --> 32:54.504
Shut up, he'll love you.

33:40.218 --> 33:41.218
Shit.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.900
Knock knock.

33:56.902 --> 33:57.902
Come in.

33:59.637 --> 34:00.637
I'm going to group.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.072
- Okay.
- Don't stay up.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.174
Okay.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.742
Can I borrow dad's bronco
while you're at your meeting?

34:05.744 --> 34:06.977
Oh honey, I don't think so.

34:06.979 --> 34:08.545
I need to go to Michael's
first science project.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.648
Plus I was thinking about
seeing the sixth sense again.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.248
Fine, but be careful.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.884
I will be, I promise.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.152
Do you need money?

34:15.154 --> 34:16.152
Sure.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.221
All right, here ya go.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.525
And also make sure you
get gas on your way home.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.793
Okay I will.

34:24.661 --> 34:26.096
All right see you.

35:26.757 --> 35:27.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.392
Would you like a cup?

35:29.394 --> 35:30.293
Oh thank you.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.461
Careful, it's very hot.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.762
Good.

35:32.764 --> 35:33.763
Pam, right?

35:33.765 --> 35:34.598
Yes.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.632
Hello.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.566
Hi.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.734
I'm Lloyd.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.603
Yes I remember.

35:39.605 --> 35:40.604
Oops sorry, no go ahead.

35:40.606 --> 35:41.571
No you go.

35:41.573 --> 35:42.973
I insist.

35:43.574 --> 35:44.641
Okay.

35:45.576 --> 35:46.576
Grab one.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.044
Oh that was mine.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.189
Can I help you?

36:32.191 --> 36:34.357
Hi, I'm miles Walton
from Pondley high.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.294
I'm on the volleyball
team there, um...

36:37.296 --> 36:38.361
I sent you an email

36:38.363 --> 36:40.697
but I wanted to also give you

36:40.699 --> 36:43.733
a schedule of all our
games this season.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.036
I wrote them down for you.

36:50.474 --> 36:53.043
I'd really love it if you could

36:53.045 --> 36:54.644
come and watch me
play so I could

36:54.646 --> 36:57.647
be considered for a scholarship.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.482
In fact, our first game
is coming up at home.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.551
So if you could make it?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.554
Well this is a first.

37:04.556 --> 37:08.124
Never had someone come
to my door before.

37:10.661 --> 37:14.831
So uh, how did you
get my address?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.334
I'm sorry, I just
wanted to make sure

37:16.335 --> 37:17.934
you got all my messages.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.737
Oh I think I'm all set, miles.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.843
Look, I've got a pretty
busy schedule right now,

37:25.844 --> 37:27.377
but I'll be sure to let you know

37:27.379 --> 37:29.913
if I can make it down
to Pondley, all right?

37:29.915 --> 37:31.281
Thank you so much.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.515
That would be amazing.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.951
Okay, you have
a safe drive back.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.119
Thank you.

37:44.929 --> 37:45.929
Hey Pam?

37:46.764 --> 37:49.532
That was a good session
don't you think?

37:49.534 --> 37:51.601
Oh yeah, I thought it
was really good this week.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.137
I feel like it's helping.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.372
Yeah me too.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.940
Yeah, good.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.708
Yeah.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.545
Um...

38:04.382 --> 38:05.416
This is gonna sound
weird no matter

38:05.417 --> 38:06.583
how I say it.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.152
But seeing as we all
know we're singles here,

38:09.154 --> 38:12.922
I was wondering if you might
like to have dinner sometime?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.724
With me.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.226
Oh.

38:16.228 --> 38:17.394
You don't have to.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.629
Oh no, but would that be

38:19.631 --> 38:22.265
kinda weird because
you're my boss.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.233
Well I'm not actually your boss

38:23.235 --> 38:25.568
I'm your bosses boss.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.971
Though I do have the power
to fire you on the spot.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.073
Oh do you?

38:29.273 --> 38:32.809
Well that was a bad joke,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.810
It's okay.

38:33.812 --> 38:34.944
You don't have to.

38:34.946 --> 38:35.779
Let me just ask you this.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.580
If we did go out,

38:37.582 --> 38:39.582
would I have to tell Trent?

38:39.584 --> 38:40.817
Trent?

38:40.819 --> 38:44.321
Trent our principle,
Trent Wilson, my boss.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.088
Wilson.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.923
No, you could if you'd like,

38:46.925 --> 38:48.958
but I don't think
it's necessary.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.960
Hmm.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.929
Is that a yes?

38:52.931 --> 38:54.264
Yeah I think it is.

38:54.266 --> 38:57.267
All right, well good,
good, good, good, good, good.

38:57.269 --> 38:59.536
You'll have to fire
me on another day.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.538
You got it.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.107
- Same way.
- Oh.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.710
- You go.
- I'll go first.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.729
Hey, you feeling ready?

39:25.731 --> 39:26.563
Hey.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.466
All right I brought you these.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.536
Got you the number you wanted.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.571
Awesome.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.706
Yeah, looking good, right?

39:38.642 --> 39:40.643
Umm, what are these?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.645
- Those are your bun huggers.
- Um...

39:42.647 --> 39:45.749
You know, your coochie cutters?

39:45.751 --> 39:46.817
You hadn't noticed the
tight little shorts

39:46.818 --> 39:49.319
the girls were wearing?

39:49.321 --> 39:51.855
You know what, why don't you
just wear your PE shorts.

39:51.857 --> 39:52.989
Yeah that sounds good.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.591
Okay, all right I'll
see you out there.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.493
All right.

40:04.001 --> 40:07.504
Let's hear it for
our lady warriors!

40:07.506 --> 40:10.340
Number nine, senior,
Wendy Prazda.

40:11.342 --> 40:14.677
Number two, junior,
Penelope Walker.

40:14.679 --> 40:18.748
Number 17, senior, miles Walton.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.404
Let's hear
it for your home team!

41:14.406 --> 41:16.139
That's 15 points, folks!

41:16.141 --> 41:18.908
And a first set
for Pondley high.

41:32.590 --> 41:33.656
Yes.

41:43.869 --> 41:46.636
Pondley high wins!

41:46.638 --> 41:50.273
Your lady warriors win their
first game with a shut out!

41:50.275 --> 41:51.875
Go Pondley!

41:52.943 --> 41:55.612
Good game, good game, good game,

41:55.614 --> 41:59.616
good game, good game, good
game, good game, good game.

42:58.108 --> 42:59.742
Good game last night.

42:59.744 --> 43:00.777
Thanks, Rory.

43:03.047 --> 43:04.480
You have a five?

43:07.084 --> 43:10.687
So, are you really sticking
with this girls' team thing?

43:10.689 --> 43:12.221
Yeah it's fun.

43:12.223 --> 43:14.958
Well I heard some people
are ticked about it.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.092
Really?

43:16.094 --> 43:17.560
Yeah, like you're trying to make

43:17.562 --> 43:20.530
some big statement or something.

43:20.532 --> 43:23.266
I don't know, I just really
like playing volleyball.

43:23.268 --> 43:24.301
I hope it's really not that big

43:24.302 --> 43:26.169
of a deal or anything.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.907
Run, Lola, run, right?

43:30.909 --> 43:32.642
The eye level camera
angles and long takes

43:32.644 --> 43:34.611
when she runs are insane.

43:35.713 --> 43:37.146
Cool.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.315
I just like the poster
because of her hair.

43:39.317 --> 43:40.717
Thanks for the hookup and

43:40.719 --> 43:42.552
good luck on the team.

43:55.065 --> 43:56.633
Hey coach.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.635
I just had a talk
with coach Tilden.

43:58.637 --> 44:00.069
He said his girls
aren't comfortable

44:00.071 --> 44:02.739
playing against your
team with a boy on it.

44:02.741 --> 44:04.141
Why, 'cause they
know we're gonna win?

44:04.341 --> 44:06.743
Girls regulation nets are
six and a half inches lower

44:06.745 --> 44:07.744
than the boys' nets.

44:07.746 --> 44:09.579
Oh please, can
we just play ball?

44:09.581 --> 44:12.615
Look, I'm just passing
the message here.

44:12.617 --> 44:14.584
Nah, he's going in.

44:14.586 --> 44:15.852
All right then.

44:27.431 --> 44:28.431
Pam Walton?

44:28.433 --> 44:30.099
Oh hi, Marge.

44:30.101 --> 44:33.102
I thought I saw you over there.

44:33.104 --> 44:35.104
So you're still teaching
history over at Calvary?

44:35.106 --> 44:36.272
Mmm hmm.

44:36.274 --> 44:37.607
I was hoping I'd run into you.

44:37.609 --> 44:40.443
I didn't get to catch
you at the game.

44:40.445 --> 44:42.145
I wanna ask you about
something for Lisa.

44:42.147 --> 44:43.279
My oldest.

44:43.281 --> 44:44.480
Oh sure, what's that?

44:44.482 --> 44:45.448
Your boy, miles,

44:45.450 --> 44:46.750
what do you think
the chances are

44:46.950 --> 44:49.652
he's gonna keep playing on
the girls' team like he is?

44:49.654 --> 44:52.321
He sure slaughtered our
poor girls last night.

44:53.792 --> 44:55.725
Well he is really enjoying it.

44:55.727 --> 44:56.960
In fact, they're
actually over playing

44:56.961 --> 44:58.194
their first away game.

44:58.196 --> 44:59.562
How is Lisa liking it?

44:59.564 --> 45:01.064
Oh she loves it.

45:01.066 --> 45:02.532
Oh good, good.

45:04.234 --> 45:05.535
Pam, the thing is,

45:05.537 --> 45:09.138
is Pondley shut us
out in two sets.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.074
And you know, it's funny,

45:11.076 --> 45:12.542
but some of the
girls on Lisa's team

45:12.544 --> 45:14.310
were saying that
it's not really fair

45:14.312 --> 45:15.478
him being a boy and all.

45:15.480 --> 45:20.817
I think there might
be rules about that.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.318
Well, you know.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.653
Boys will be boys.

45:23.655 --> 45:24.587
Well.

45:24.589 --> 45:26.622
And miles will be miles.

45:28.992 --> 45:31.194
Besides, if the
conference had a boys' team

45:31.196 --> 45:32.729
this wouldn't even be an issue.

45:32.731 --> 45:34.230
Well they do have boys' teams.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.666
But for football and baseball.

45:38.602 --> 45:39.602
Right.

45:41.338 --> 45:42.338
Right.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.076
Well, just something
to think about.

45:47.078 --> 45:48.111
Mmm hmm.

45:48.113 --> 45:49.245
I should get going.

45:49.247 --> 45:50.513
Okay, sounds good.

45:50.515 --> 45:51.849
Please give my
best to your girls.

45:51.850 --> 45:52.615
You take care now.

45:52.617 --> 45:54.117
You, too.

46:14.805 --> 46:15.805
Yes!

46:20.711 --> 46:22.445
Good job, miles!

46:33.123 --> 46:34.123
Yes!

46:56.580 --> 46:58.915
Hey you're back!

46:58.917 --> 46:59.982
I'm going to my group.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.450
Okay.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.286
There's dinner and
groceries in the fridge.

47:03.288 --> 47:04.554
Sounds good.

47:07.524 --> 47:09.025
How was your game?

47:09.027 --> 47:10.092
It was fine.

47:10.094 --> 47:12.261
How many points did you score?

47:12.263 --> 47:14.363
Uh, I don't remember.

47:14.365 --> 47:15.766
I'm probably just
gonna watch the Goonies

47:15.767 --> 47:17.600
in my room tonight
if that's all right.

47:17.602 --> 47:19.869
That's fine, sweetie pie.

47:20.604 --> 47:21.971
Have fun tonight.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.973
Don't wanna be late!

47:23.975 --> 47:24.774
Bye.

47:24.776 --> 47:25.776
Bye.

47:28.779 --> 47:32.548
You know, it's been so
long now since Angela passed.

47:32.550 --> 47:35.952
And... so now that the kids
are out of the house,

47:35.954 --> 47:39.288
it's starting, just
starting to feel like

47:39.290 --> 47:41.958
maybe this is a new chapter.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.460
Mmm hmm, you feel like
a whole new person, right?

47:44.462 --> 47:46.729
Yes, yes, exactly!

47:46.731 --> 47:47.731
So you know.

47:48.031 --> 47:51.701
Well maybe it's time
to start working out.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.636
Or just to try new things.

47:53.638 --> 47:57.540
Try to push myself out of my
comfort zone, do you know?

47:57.542 --> 47:58.641
Cheers to that.

47:58.643 --> 48:00.076
That's what I'd like to say.

48:00.078 --> 48:03.980
Cheers and to
having a lovely dinner

48:03.982 --> 48:05.648
with a gorgeous woman.

48:05.650 --> 48:08.584
Awe, well I wouldn't
say gorgeous but...

48:08.586 --> 48:10.386
Oh, I sure would.

48:11.822 --> 48:12.989
That's so sweet.

48:18.328 --> 48:21.163
So when you shared that
story with the group,

48:21.165 --> 48:23.933
about Ron's mistress
and the car.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.002
Oh my goodness.

48:26.004 --> 48:30.573
How are you not absolutely
losing your mind over that?

48:33.278 --> 48:34.210
I don't know.

48:34.212 --> 48:35.544
I mean believe me, I've had some

48:35.546 --> 48:37.713
terrible, terrible thoughts.

48:37.715 --> 48:39.348
I bet.

48:39.350 --> 48:40.617
Put it this way,
she would not wanna

48:40.618 --> 48:42.785
meet me in a dark alley, okay?

48:42.787 --> 48:44.620
I'd knock her teeth out.

48:44.622 --> 48:46.522
But I don't know what to do.

48:46.524 --> 48:48.024
The thing is in her name.

48:48.026 --> 48:51.060
Her lunatic mother protects
her like a bulldog.

48:51.062 --> 48:52.528
And she looks like one, too.

48:53.932 --> 48:55.198
Is that so mean
of me to say that?

48:55.199 --> 48:56.966
No, you're so not mean.

48:56.968 --> 49:00.369
What if you weren't so nice,
what would you do?

49:00.371 --> 49:02.204
If you could do anything
about this right now,

49:02.206 --> 49:03.639
what would you do?

49:04.741 --> 49:05.541
Anything?

49:05.543 --> 49:08.444
Yeah, if you weren't so sweet.

49:09.646 --> 49:12.915
You're gonna think I'm terrible.

49:12.917 --> 49:15.151
All right, this might be
the wine talking but...

49:16.621 --> 49:17.753
No!

49:35.405 --> 49:36.439
Drive!

49:47.084 --> 49:49.885
Oh I'm so glad
you're still awake!

49:50.654 --> 49:52.755
How ya doing, buddy?

49:52.757 --> 49:53.757
Good.

49:56.594 --> 49:58.694
So who is the date with?

49:58.696 --> 50:01.030
How'd you know I was on a date?

50:01.032 --> 50:02.865
You never wear that
to a group meeting.

50:02.867 --> 50:06.702
You also never wear
this much perfume.

50:06.704 --> 50:09.505
I think that smell is the wine.

50:10.707 --> 50:11.707
Wow.

50:14.711 --> 50:16.645
So, are you okay with this?

50:16.647 --> 50:17.947
With me going on a date?

50:17.949 --> 50:19.782
Yeah we're cool.

50:19.784 --> 50:21.050
I want you to have fun.

50:21.052 --> 50:21.984
Was it good?

50:21.986 --> 50:23.386
It was great!

50:23.388 --> 50:25.621
So, who is he?

50:25.623 --> 50:27.523
Are you ready for this?

50:27.525 --> 50:28.525
Mr. Bryant.

50:29.726 --> 50:32.294
The new superintendent.

50:32.296 --> 50:34.730
Whoa, scandal.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.799
Scandal.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.469
Are you gonna get
in trouble for that?

50:40.471 --> 50:41.571
No I'm not gonna get in trouble.

50:41.572 --> 50:43.539
We can be very,
very professional.

50:46.810 --> 50:50.546
As long as I lay off the wine,
I think we'll be fine.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.547
Hey!

50:51.549 --> 50:53.049
We should get pizza.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.316
Way too late.

50:54.318 --> 50:55.484
You should go to bed.

50:55.486 --> 50:56.752
You're right.

50:56.754 --> 50:57.486
Night-night.

50:57.488 --> 51:02.058
- See you up in the morning.
- Love you.

51:02.060 --> 51:03.325
I really do.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.532
The reason that I wanted
to speak to everyone

51:09.534 --> 51:12.501
is because we've had some
complaints about miles

51:12.503 --> 51:15.004
playing on the girls' team.

51:15.006 --> 51:17.206
Okay, what about it?

51:17.208 --> 51:19.341
The Illinois high
school association

51:19.343 --> 51:20.576
gave me a ring yesterday.

51:20.578 --> 51:23.412
There's a petition going
around to stop him.

51:23.414 --> 51:24.548
What do you want from me, Trent?

51:24.549 --> 51:27.016
He tried out, he was really
good, he made the team.

51:27.018 --> 51:28.117
They're just jealous.

51:28.119 --> 51:30.086
Well, that's the
issue here, Leslie.

51:30.088 --> 51:32.455
They think there might
be an unfair advantage.

51:32.457 --> 51:33.723
Can we find a way
for him to play

51:33.724 --> 51:35.391
a more appropriate sport?

51:35.393 --> 51:37.026
Appropriate sport?

51:37.028 --> 51:38.961
No, this is his sport.

51:38.963 --> 51:41.430
Mr. Wilson, I get it that
people are upset about this.

51:41.432 --> 51:42.699
But since there's no boys' team,

51:42.700 --> 51:45.468
I have to stay on
the girls' team.

51:45.998 --> 51:47.437
Honey, let me ask you.

51:47.438 --> 51:50.773
Why is this so, so
important to you?

51:50.775 --> 51:52.943
Because, I'm trying to get
this volleyball scholarship

51:52.944 --> 51:54.610
that'll get me into Loyola.

51:54.612 --> 51:55.978
It's almost a full ride

51:55.980 --> 51:57.646
and since you and dad
couldn't pay for it,

51:57.648 --> 52:00.816
I thought I'd take
care of it myself.

52:02.152 --> 52:02.985
What?

52:02.987 --> 52:05.121
So that's what
this is all about?

52:05.123 --> 52:06.489
Yeah, it's the
only chance to get

52:06.491 --> 52:08.557
to Chicago I still have.

52:10.427 --> 52:13.062
Honey, I hate to have to
be the one to tell you this,

52:13.064 --> 52:15.564
but it is extremely
difficult to get

52:15.566 --> 52:17.099
a sports scholarship anywhere.

52:17.101 --> 52:19.268
You have to be like really good.

52:19.270 --> 52:22.638
He is playing fair and
square by state rules.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.574
Unless Trent wants to put
together a boys' team for him?

52:25.576 --> 52:26.976
You know that I can't do that.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.611
It would take thousands.

52:28.613 --> 52:30.746
We're strapped enough as it is.

52:30.748 --> 52:32.414
And it'd be even
more phone calls.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.916
Well he's staying.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.152
If they're so worried about it,

52:35.153 --> 52:36.585
tell 'em to practice harder.

52:36.587 --> 52:38.754
We're barely into
the season, Leslie,

52:38.756 --> 52:40.589
and already there's
an IHSA investigation.

52:40.591 --> 52:42.291
Can't we quit while we're ahead?

52:42.293 --> 52:43.259
No, we cannot.

52:43.261 --> 52:44.594
And I will take this
thing all the way

52:44.595 --> 52:45.795
to the top if I have to, Trent.

52:45.796 --> 52:49.665
I don't have to listen
to all this horse shit.

52:50.700 --> 52:52.935
I'm really not trying
to upset everyone.

52:52.937 --> 52:55.104
Pam, I could sure
use your help on this.

52:55.106 --> 52:56.772
What can we do here?

52:58.275 --> 53:01.277
Honey, what about joining

53:01.279 --> 53:03.445
the computer club or something?

53:03.447 --> 53:06.448
You know, you're always
at home on the computer.

53:06.450 --> 53:09.218
Yeah, maybe we could
expand your av duties.

53:09.220 --> 53:12.221
I like playing, it's the
only sport I'm good at.

53:12.223 --> 53:13.956
I know, but it
would mean so much

53:13.958 --> 53:15.624
to the other teams
and their parents

53:15.626 --> 53:19.695
if you would just consider
any other options.

53:19.697 --> 53:23.132
Is there a law saying I
have to quit or something?

53:23.134 --> 53:24.800
I'll tell you what.

53:24.802 --> 53:26.702
I've never done this before.

53:26.704 --> 53:30.573
But what is we got you on the
varsity baseball team, huh?

53:30.575 --> 53:31.740
How's that sound?

53:31.742 --> 53:34.643
Name the position, it's yours.

53:34.645 --> 53:38.214
I'm sorry but I've
got to get to class.

53:51.028 --> 53:52.028
Miles.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.267
Quincy high forfeits.

53:58.269 --> 53:59.401
What?!

53:59.403 --> 54:00.403
Come on!

54:14.718 --> 54:17.119
Sub 17 for 7.

54:26.696 --> 54:28.864
McCarthy forfeits the game.

54:43.413 --> 54:45.347
Sub, 17 for six.

54:45.982 --> 54:47.249
Miles, you're in for Paris.

54:47.251 --> 54:48.050
Really?

54:48.052 --> 54:48.817
Yeah, go.

54:48.819 --> 54:49.819
Okay.

54:52.322 --> 54:55.057
17 for six.

54:55.059 --> 54:57.059
Time out, Ursuline academy.

54:57.061 --> 54:58.494
Come on, girls.

55:01.598 --> 55:03.966
Just huddle up,
I'll take care of this.

55:03.968 --> 55:05.467
What am I supposed
to do with this?

55:05.469 --> 55:07.303
I can't play with
that kid on the court.

55:07.305 --> 55:09.872
Good work out there...

55:11.074 --> 55:12.808
It's the league rules
and everything.

55:12.810 --> 55:14.743
What's the problem here?

55:14.745 --> 55:16.045
What can we do
about this, Leslie?

55:16.145 --> 55:17.746
You know I can't play with
that boy on the court.

55:17.748 --> 55:19.748
Oh for god's sake,
why are you doing this?

55:19.750 --> 55:21.250
You know why I'm doing this.

55:21.252 --> 55:22.818
I got parents
breathing down my neck.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.486
If that boy so much
as touches the ball,

55:24.488 --> 55:25.588
I'm supposed to
call the game off

55:25.589 --> 55:26.989
and nobody wants that.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.925
Just let the kid get a little
bit of playtime, all right?

55:28.926 --> 55:30.693
How 'bout until the
end of the set?

55:30.695 --> 55:32.761
Sorry Leslie,
my hands are tied here.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.763
All right, what are
we gonna do, folks?

55:34.765 --> 55:37.299
Leslie, you know this
isn't coming from me.

55:37.301 --> 55:38.634
I understand that Rick,

55:38.636 --> 55:40.703
but grow a pair, will you?

55:40.705 --> 55:42.271
I'll handle this.

55:42.273 --> 55:45.507
We're fine, miles,
go ahead and serve.

55:50.147 --> 55:52.014
You know what to do.

56:04.294 --> 56:05.528
All right the game is called.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.396
Ursuline academy forfeits.

56:07.398 --> 56:10.799
All right, let's go, folks,
pack it up!

56:11.701 --> 56:12.701
Ridiculous.

56:15.239 --> 56:17.239
Great, just great.

56:17.241 --> 56:19.641
Shake it off, Brazda, it's done.

56:19.643 --> 56:21.143
Shame on you!

56:21.145 --> 56:22.478
Get your own team!

57:00.183 --> 57:02.551
Knock, knock, can I come in?

57:02.553 --> 57:03.352
Hey Steve.

57:03.354 --> 57:04.354
Hey.

57:04.888 --> 57:07.689
Uh, mind if we have
a little chat?

57:07.691 --> 57:09.358
Sure, what's up?

57:09.360 --> 57:15.264
Um... So how's the
volleyball thing going?

57:16.433 --> 57:18.801
A customer told me
about it the other day.

57:18.803 --> 57:20.302
Pointed you out.

57:21.070 --> 57:21.937
Oh yeah.

57:21.939 --> 57:22.939
Yeah.

57:23.740 --> 57:27.042
Yeah, a couple people have,
actually.

57:27.044 --> 57:29.878
I had no idea it
was this big deal.

57:29.880 --> 57:32.481
Yeah, people are crazy about

57:32.483 --> 57:35.651
their volleyball
around here, I guess.

57:37.554 --> 57:38.720
Right, yup.

57:43.893 --> 57:47.229
So listen, I hate
to have to do this.

57:47.231 --> 57:50.799
And I always hate
having these talks but,

57:52.802 --> 57:55.404
I'm gonna have to let you go.

57:55.406 --> 57:56.738
What?

57:56.740 --> 57:57.740
Why?

57:58.942 --> 58:02.611
Well, I was doing some
poster inventory the other day

58:02.613 --> 58:05.380
and I noticed a few
were missing.

58:06.583 --> 58:07.950
I know you took 'em

58:07.952 --> 58:10.452
and I can't have that.

58:10.454 --> 58:12.654
But everyone takes those
old posters all the time.

58:12.656 --> 58:16.825
Or they just end up
getting thrown out anyway.

58:18.595 --> 58:19.696
Listen, I don't
wanna make this harder

58:19.697 --> 58:21.096
than it needs to be.

58:21.098 --> 58:23.832
So, if you just wanna

58:24.767 --> 58:25.767
head home now.

58:26.970 --> 58:30.772
I can man the booth
the rest of your shift.

58:32.108 --> 58:33.475
And I won't say nothing.

58:33.477 --> 58:35.711
I can just say you quit to work

58:35.713 --> 58:38.780
the new multiplex in
Springfield or something.

58:38.782 --> 58:40.716
Please don't fire me.

58:43.987 --> 58:45.621
It's been a pleasure, miles,

58:45.623 --> 58:47.789
and I wish you luck and all,

58:47.791 --> 58:50.459
but I can't budge on this one.

58:50.461 --> 58:52.528
I'm letting you go
and that's that.

59:11.814 --> 59:14.149
So what are you gonna do?

59:18.488 --> 59:19.488
Hmm?

59:21.491 --> 59:22.725
You know what I
think you should do?

59:22.726 --> 59:24.993
I think you should go
back to the theater

59:24.995 --> 59:27.029
with every poster from your room

59:27.031 --> 59:29.097
and ask them to take it
out of your paycheck.

59:29.099 --> 59:30.400
That's what I think
you should do.

59:30.401 --> 59:34.169
Mom, this has nothing
to do with the posters.

59:34.171 --> 59:35.171
It's over.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.541
Honey, I really
think this scholarship

59:38.542 --> 59:40.175
business is getting out of hand.

59:40.177 --> 59:42.077
You gotta get your
priorities straight.

59:42.079 --> 59:43.279
I don't wanna stay in this town

59:43.280 --> 59:44.913
any longer than I have to.

59:44.915 --> 59:46.449
And I don't wanna end
up like you and dad

59:46.450 --> 59:49.084
and be completely unhappy.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.652
This is my way out.

59:51.854 --> 59:53.088
I'm not unhappy.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.456
Mom, I'm sorry but you are!

59:54.458 --> 59:56.592
You're so stuck in this town!

59:56.594 --> 59:58.393
All you ever do is go to work,

59:58.395 --> 59:59.294
come home and cook dinner,

59:59.296 --> 01:00:01.229
and cut coupons every Saturday!

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:03.432
I don't want that and
I've never wanted that!

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:04.600
Okay and that's fine!

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.268
You don't have to want that,
I understand!

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.569
Don't want that!

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:10.038
But I don't see what the big
rush is to get to Chicago.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.574
I mean, I don't see
that there's anything

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.575
wrong with you staying
here for awhile,

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:15.110
saving up a little money,

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.980
and then you can go to
the college that you want!

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:18.213
What's wrong with that?!

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.247
I knew you'd say that.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:20.650
Well, sometimes
you gotta be a little

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:21.851
more patient with
this stuff, miles.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:22.885
I'm sorry, mom,
but I'm not gonna let

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:24.554
dad screwing around and
blowing all our money

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:26.221
mess up my future.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:29.391
And you shouldn't either.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.661
Miles.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.566
In two months,

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:39.134
we get along fine.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.969
You do love me don't you?

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.738
I think so but,

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.873
I have to think about it.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.644
Hello, dear.

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:49.444
Hello, mom.

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.079
Have a nice time?

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.948
Jeff's awfully handsome.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.683
Such a smooth dancer.

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.926
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.596
I need to let you all
know that the forfeit

01:01:06.597 --> 01:01:09.097
petition has been
approved by the IHSA.

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.766
What does this mean?

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.601
Well there's a hearing
Thursday night.

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:14.870
Miles, you and coach Wayne,
you'll need to be there

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:15.972
so that you can answer

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:19.541
superintendent
Bryant's questions.

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:21.643
Trent, are there
any other options?

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.445
Well, he could leave the team.

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:24.613
That's some option.

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:26.381
For god's sake,
just let him play.

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:27.650
Mr. Wilson,
what if I just sat out

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:29.818
for most of our games so
I don't bother anyone?

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.620
Well, you can ask
him on Thursday.

01:01:31.622 --> 01:01:34.623
But it sounds like they've
made up their minds.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.725
All right, that's all I have.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.126
Great, thanks.

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:47.636
Hey.

01:01:47.638 --> 01:01:48.470
Hey.

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:50.138
Listen, I just wanna say

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.640
I know this thing
has gotten a little

01:01:51.642 --> 01:01:53.709
blown out of
proportion here and,

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.977
I can tell some feelings
are getting hurt

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:57.546
and I certainly don't want that.

01:01:57.548 --> 01:01:59.314
I don't think anybody does.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:02.884
But, I was just hoping

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.220
for the best for miles here

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.990
and not give him
any mixed messages.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:10.659
You know?

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:12.694
I'm not sure I can
help you with that, Pam.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:14.362
Miles is doing what
he feels is right

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:16.198
and that's good for him.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.033
Right, but I think
I can be the judge

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.068
of what's best
for my son or not.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.703
I think miles is
old enough to be

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:23.271
the judge for himself.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:25.273
He's certainly
inspired me more than

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:27.542
any other high school kid
ever has.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:29.711
And maybe, I don't know,

01:02:29.713 --> 01:02:31.613
I think maybe
Pondley needs to see

01:02:31.615 --> 01:02:34.616
this kind of courage
more than we realize.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:37.352
More than you realize, Pam.

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:05.714
Is that okay?

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:06.815
Yeah.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.121
Is it okay?

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:15.157
Yeah.

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.159
Yeah.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.741
So I was thinking,

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:35.143
it'd be nice to have you come
over for dinner sometime.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.479
Maybe even tomorrow night.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.248
Sure, yeah.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.750
I'd love that.

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:44.920
It'd be nice for you to
spend some time with miles.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:45.987
Yeah.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:48.590
I'm sure he'd like to
get to know you better.

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:49.925
Yeah.

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:51.259
Maybe you two could talk about

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:56.264
this whole volleyball thing
before the big hearing.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:58.266
Oh whoa, whoa.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.135
Hold on, hold on.

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:02.270
Please tell me,
please tell me that's not

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.705
what this is all about.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:04.573
No.

01:04:04.575 --> 01:04:05.273
Are you sure?

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:06.275
Yes.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.109
I just get the feeling
it's a big deal to him

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.611
and I was just...

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.613
all right, well,

01:04:11.615 --> 01:04:12.614
just so you know I'm getting

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:15.483
a lot of pressure
from other parents.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:17.452
From all sides.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.054
Miles being on this girls' team

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:21.823
is causing real problems.

01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:24.526
That they come here
for a fair game,

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:28.263
and then this is not
what they signed up for.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:32.868
And besides, is this really

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.637
the best way to make
this kind of statement?

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.806
He's just playing a game.

01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:38.908
And I've never seen
him so passionate

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.642
about anything ever.

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:43.645
Except for maybe
moving away from Pondley.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:44.880
Well,

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.982
if we don't make an
example out of this,

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:50.652
then all the teams are gonna
try becoming co-ed one day.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:51.988
And all the students
are gonna think

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:54.322
they have some sort
of open door now

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:56.858
to challenge everything
they don't like.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:59.728
So what's wrong with that?

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.665
Well for starters it
makes my job a lot harder.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.602
Look, if he wants

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:10.705
a boys volleyball team,
there's a right way to do it

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.374
and there's a wrong way
to do it.

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:14.643
This is not the right way.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.279
Okay.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.349
Don't get me wrong.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:24.753
I would love to come to
your home for dinner.

01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:25.620
I really would.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.622
I like you very much.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:30.191
I like you, too.

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:31.793
Well I'm glad.

01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:35.864
I just don't want all of
that to ruin all of this.

01:05:35.866 --> 01:05:36.965
Uh huh.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:37.967
Please.

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:40.302
Okay, sure.

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:42.971
Good.

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:47.542
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:48.576
Okay.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:49.811
In there.

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:23.311
You have mail.

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:34.756
Whoa!

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:36.758
No way.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.326
Oh hell yeah!

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.452
Please quiet down.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:06.221
We have quite a lot
to cover tonight,

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:09.691
so why don't we just
get things rolling.

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.627
I'd like to jump right
into the matter of

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:15.530
student miles Walton
and his involvement

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.732
with the girls volleyball team.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:19.235
Let the minutes reflect
we have Mr. Walton

01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:22.871
here with us as well
as his coach, Ms. Wayne.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.474
Ms. Wayne, can you tell us

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:29.144
how long Mr. Walton
has been on your team?

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:31.479
- The entire year.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.481
And was he approved to play?

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.583
Yes he was.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:38.319
He tried out and made the team
with his mother's permission.

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:39.487
Okay, thank you.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:41.556
Now as you may know,

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:44.559
we have a lot of opposition

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:45.827
from local parents.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:47.362
Are you aware of that?

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:48.897
I am aware of it.

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.433
Okay.

01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:54.702
Now you have won six out
of eight games played.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:58.740
Four of those six due to
opposing teams forfeiting.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:00.575
Is that correct?

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:04.946
It is, but they chose
to forfeit, not us.

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:06.781
Well, Mr. Walton,

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:12.020
I hate to say it but the
Illinois high school association

01:08:12.022 --> 01:08:14.756
has really carefully
considered your situation.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:17.425
And in this case
they have decided

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.995
that miles cannot play on
the girls volleyball team.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:21.997
Wait, why?!

01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:24.566
And to ensure your cooperation,

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:25.868
the board has been
advised to immediately

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.803
suspend Mr. Walton if
he should try to play.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.404
You gotta be kidding me!

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:31.573
That's completely unfair!

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.608
If title nine says a girl
can play on a boys' team

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.111
then why can't I play
on a girls' team?

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:38.046
I am sorry, I truly am.

01:08:38.048 --> 01:08:39.581
But they've made their decision,

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:43.283
and we have to
take it seriously.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:47.589
Let the record reflect
Mr. Walton is hereby no longer

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.890
involved with the team.

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:52.260
That's not fair,
we want him on the team.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:53.895
I second that.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:56.064
Moved and seconded, thank you.

01:08:56.066 --> 01:08:57.398
It's not about winning.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.901
He has a college
recruiter interested.

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:00.970
He's coming to
our game tomorrow.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:01.903
I have to play.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.404
Here's the letter he sent me.

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:06.441
Miles, this is an
open and shut situation.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:07.575
It really is, I'm sorry.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.310
The kid is trying to
get himself into college!

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.145
Why the hell are you
trying to stop him?

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.747
Ms. Wayne, can we try
to keep this professional?

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.750
Just because a boy
wants to play volleyball

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:17.952
you try to shut it
down immediately?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.121
Leslie, it would
really be in your

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:22.290
best interest to stop
talking right now.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.093
- Lloyd please.
- - What, are we living in the dark ages?

01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:25.093
Would you please
just look at this?

01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:26.627
Just let him read his letter!

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.595
"Hi miles, you're in luck."

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.264
"I'm coming to see
your match this Friday"

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.265
"against mount Palasky..."

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.966
I'm so sorry, but we are done...

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:33.600
let the kid read the thing!

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:35.270
We are done
discussing this matter

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:37.538
and moving on with our agenda.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:39.274
You all should be
ashamed of yourself.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:42.176
You're a bunch of
narrow-minded cavemen.

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:43.179
Please!

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.212
I move to suspend
Ms. Wayne for two weeks

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:47.115
without pay
effective immediately.

01:09:47.117 --> 01:09:48.149
Wait, no!

01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:49.117
Second.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.618
Moved and seconded, thank you!

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:52.453
This is...

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:53.321
bullshit!

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.423
Miles.

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:57.292
I just wanna run away from
this stupid small-minded town.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.128
Look, I know this seems
like a big deal right now,

01:09:59.129 --> 01:10:01.563
but in the grand scheme
of things it's really not.

01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:02.463
I'm sure for you it isn't.

01:10:02.465 --> 01:10:04.065
You'd live here
forever if you could.

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:06.634
Look, just try to finish
high school in one piece.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:08.303
You can stay here
a little bit longer

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:09.804
and then you can go
wherever you want.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.073
For what, so I
can start being some

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:13.641
unfulfilled zombie like
everybody else in this town?!

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:15.043
Like you and your
boss boyfriend?

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:16.145
How can you date
him knowing he's

01:10:16.146 --> 01:10:17.745
holding me back from everything?

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.647
All right, miles,
that is enough!

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.250
You have no idea what
you are talking about.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:25.119
I just wanna run away right now.

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:29.657
Fine, you wanna run away?

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.526
You really wanna run away?!

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:32.627
Here.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.667
Get out.

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:42.170
If you wanna be gone so badly
then run away right now!

01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:43.572
If you hate where
you came from so much

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:44.707
and the people who
raised you then go!

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:45.740
I'd love to!

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:46.909
I don't care what
you do anymore!

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.110
Go all the way to damn
Chicago for all I care!

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:49.911
I will!

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.079
Good, I dare you!

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.347
Fuck finishing high school!

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:53.349
Fine!

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:18.640
I'm so glad you're still here.

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:20.708
Well, I'm barely here.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.610
I'm exhausted.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:23.879
Listen Lloyd, this
whole volleyball thing

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.713
has really gotten out of hand.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:30.051
Is there anything you can
do to help me out here?

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:31.053
Pam.

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.756
Did you not see
what happened here?

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:36.391
This is my son, Lloyd?!

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.893
This is involves his whole
future, do you understand?

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.396
Can't you just let him stay
on for just one more game

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.097
is all I'm asking?!

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.800
I wish there was something
I could do to help,

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:45.901
I really do.

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:47.902
But then let him stay on
for one more game!

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.605
I just gave the final word.

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:53.608
If I go back on this,
I could lose my job.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.144
Why don't you let miles
think about that?

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:56.577
Maybe think about
what kind of mess

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:57.746
he's making for everybody else.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.247
Oh come on.

01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:01.749
He pulls Leslie into this
and she gets all worked up.

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:05.653
Like it's some big act of
prejudice or something.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:09.724
Come on, save that crap
for Chicago or whatever.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.593
What is that supposed to mean?

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:14.762
Look, I know it seems
like a big deal to him

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.097
but he's a smart kid.

01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:17.765
And he should think about

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:21.836
maybe it's not worth
rocking the boat like this.

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.440
You know what, Lloyd?

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.974
I think maybe
Pondley needs to see

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:30.678
this kind of courage
more than we realize.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:34.949
And I think it is
worth rocking the boat.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.152
Well I disagree.

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:04.806
You have mail.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.064
Knock, knock.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.132
Hey, you made it.

01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:39.133
Oh are you kidding?!

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:40.968
There's no way I'm missing this.

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:42.036
Are you ready?

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.137
No.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.908
Listen miles, I'm
sorry about blowing up

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:47.909
at the meeting last night.

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.644
I shouldn't be speaking
for you like that.

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:50.478
No, it's good.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.546
You stood up for me.

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:52.813
I know but,

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:53.881
this is a big deal for you

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:54.983
and I shouldn't be
making it harder

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:56.484
than it needs to be.

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:58.653
No, I'm glad to
have you in my corner.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:15:59.955
I'm really sorry
you got suspended.

01:15:59.956 --> 01:16:01.156
Oh no, that's okay.

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:05.059
I'd be lying if I said I didn't
kinda want the break, so...

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.361
But it did dawn on
me earlier today

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.230
that you're only 17.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.732
You say it like it's so young.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.701
That's because it is.

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.703
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:17.405
As ready as I'll ever be.

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:18.507
Can't quit now.

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.408
How else am I supposed
to get out of Pondley?

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:23.244
You could win the lottery.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:25.246
Besides, you don't
really think they'll

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.114
do anything to me do you?

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:30.184
Oh I absolutely do.

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.040
Hey, so how are you feeling?

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:54.775
I heard the recruiter's here.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:55.910
Nervous.

01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:57.211
I hope they really let me play.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:58.312
Yeah I hope so, too.

01:16:58.314 --> 01:16:59.981
And I hope you
get a scholarship.

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:01.382
You're a damn good player,
miles.

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:02.783
Thanks, Wendy.

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:05.787
Okay, we're all rooting for you.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.622
Thanks.

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:09.091
Miles, you know you
shouldn't be here.

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.492
Just one set.

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.093
Son, I can't, we've already
been through this.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.394
Mr. Wilson, please.

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.729
It's already been decided.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:15.896
But he's already here.

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:17.598
It doesn't change anything,
I'm sorry.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.766
Number 17 can't play.

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:20.234
All right, son,
you heard the man.

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:21.969
No, I'm ready to play,
I'm playing.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:22.903
It's not happening, miles.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:24.472
No, I'm playing.

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:29.510
Number 17 is ejected.

01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:34.415
Let's not make a scene.

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:43.658
All right, I'll go.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.428
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:50.331
- Can we talk about this?
- No, not now.

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.460
I hate this town
and everyone in it.

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:20.795
Why won't they let me play?

01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:23.064
I'm sorry you
didn't get to play.

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:24.965
Why does this even
matter to them?!

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.534
I'm trapped in
this town forever!

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:28.536
Surrounded by people
who hate my guts.

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:29.638
No, no one hates your guts.

01:18:29.639 --> 01:18:33.541
Then why are they
doing this to me!?

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:34.643
I wasn't supposed
to lose my job,

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:35.976
I wasn't supposed
to lose my dad,

01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:38.646
I was supposed to go to Chicago.

01:18:38.648 --> 01:18:41.415
Everyone and everything
is against me.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.417
Miles.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.822
We're gonna get you there.

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.058
Thanks, mom.

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:33.868
Miles!

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:49.083
This is a very exciting
and very proud moment.

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:51.952
And I ask you all
to stand please.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.756
And it is my great honor

01:19:55.758 --> 01:20:00.060
to present the Pondley high
school graduating class of 2000!

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.476
Hey, thanks for everything,
Leslie.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:17.478
So you're leaving leaving?

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.747
You're not even
staying for cake?

01:20:19.749 --> 01:20:21.248
I'll be back for Thanksgiving.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.751
Well we're gonna
miss you around here.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:24.752
Chicago's getting a good one.

01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:26.321
And I don't know if your
mom told you the good news,

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.589
but principle Wilson
is retiring this summer

01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:30.758
and I am on the short
list of candidates.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.659
That's great, coach.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:32.927
Yeah.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:34.762
And you know that my gym door

01:20:34.764 --> 01:20:38.032
is always open for my
favorite lady warrior, right?

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:38.799
Got it?

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:39.633
Got it.

01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:40.701
Okay.

01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:41.702
Oh before I forget.

01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:43.037
The girls on the team pitched in

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.272
and we got you
some train passes.

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:46.707
So you should be
all set for getting

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:49.210
yourself around the city
for the next few months.

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:51.178
Wow, this is so nice.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.781
I don't know what to say.

01:20:53.783 --> 01:20:55.616
Just come hug me
and get out of here

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.685
before I start to cry.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.120
I'm proud of you.

01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:01.188
Thank you.

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:03.958
You ready?

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960
Yeah.

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:08.696
Take care.

01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.397
You too.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.720
This is it!

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:33.721
You all set?

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:34.889
I think so.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:38.592
I'm so proud of you, honey.

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:40.060
Now remember, always
keep your wallet

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:41.662
in your front pocket.

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.697
Don't go anywhere
unsafe by yourself.

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:46.100
And you can always call
a taxi if you need to.

01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:47.101
Mom. Come on.

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:49.603
It's a mom's job to worry.

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.539
Oh.

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.146
What's this?

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.752
Mom, where'd you get all this?

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:06.620
I sold dad's bronco.

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.757
Awe man.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.727
You didn't have to do all that.

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:14.995
It was time.

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:18.132
It was just sitting there.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:20.801
It's for you to get
started in Chicago!

01:22:20.803 --> 01:22:21.869
Thank you.

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:26.206
Oh!

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:29.143
And this is a li'l
going away/graduation gift.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.711
You can open it on the bus.

01:22:30.713 --> 01:22:33.147
This is all too much.

01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:35.049
I wanted to do it.

01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:36.217
Are you sure you're
gonna be all right

01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:37.618
while I'm gone?

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.822
We'll see,
it's a whole new world.

01:22:41.824 --> 01:22:42.890
Yes it is.

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:47.734
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.568
Now go.
