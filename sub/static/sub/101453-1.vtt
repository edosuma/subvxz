WEBVTT

01:58.975 --> 02:00.010
Jack?

02:00.043 --> 02:01.111
Patty?

02:01.144 --> 02:02.479
This is you.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.415
Yes, this is you.

02:04.447 --> 02:05.248
Yeah!

02:05.281 --> 02:06.483
Hey, you look
just like your picture.

02:06.516 --> 02:08.519
- Wow!
- Oh my God!

02:08.550 --> 02:09.887
Jack, I love the <i>Titanic.</i>

02:09.919 --> 02:12.022
- That's my favorite movie.
- Oh my God!

02:12.056 --> 02:13.324
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. Mine too.
- Yeah?

02:13.356 --> 02:14.891
I love when Jack drowns.

02:14.925 --> 02:15.960
Oh.

02:15.992 --> 02:16.793
- Yes, it's a really...
- That's a little morbid.

02:16.826 --> 02:18.763
It's an emotional moment
in the movie.

02:20.663 --> 02:22.500
I like sixty-five...

02:30.341 --> 02:31.542
Oh, you're smart.

02:40.818 --> 02:42.420
True?

02:42.453 --> 02:43.586
Veronica?

02:43.620 --> 02:44.555
- Hey. Oh...
- Oh...

02:44.587 --> 02:45.955
I'm a hugger.

02:45.989 --> 02:49.593
Oh, um, well, please sit.
I got you a chai latte.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.429
Your profile said
you like them so...

02:51.461 --> 02:52.562
That's so thoughtful.

02:52.596 --> 02:54.632
- Yeah.
- sorry.

02:54.664 --> 02:55.932
Do you have a cold?

02:55.966 --> 02:57.968
Uh no, no. I just, um,

02:58.001 --> 03:00.771
sometimes I get nervous.

03:00.804 --> 03:02.573
Don't be nervous.
I don't bite.

03:02.605 --> 03:03.941
Hey... you know,
enough about me.

03:03.973 --> 03:05.342
Um, what about you?

03:05.376 --> 03:06.977
You're a, uh,
veterinarian dentist?

03:07.009 --> 03:08.078
Wh... what's that like?

03:08.111 --> 03:09.646
Much like humans.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.549
I brush their teeth,
do cleanings; things like that.

03:11.581 --> 03:12.682
Don't you ever get bitten?

03:12.716 --> 03:13.850
Occasionally...

03:13.883 --> 03:14.984
But I started to bite back.

03:15.018 --> 03:16.721
Ugh! Oh! Oh!

03:16.753 --> 03:18.388
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

03:18.421 --> 03:20.056
That's so terrible!

03:20.090 --> 03:22.058
It's okay.

03:22.092 --> 03:23.728
- True, it... it happens.
- Oh, you know what?

03:23.760 --> 03:25.862
Actually, I just... I got
a text message from a client.

03:25.895 --> 03:28.631
I completely spaced that I have
to meet with her... him... her...

03:28.664 --> 03:30.501
Herman. Um...
You're great.

03:30.533 --> 03:31.668
Buh-bye.

03:31.701 --> 03:33.704
That's all yours,
if you want green tea.

03:33.736 --> 03:34.537
It's peach flavored...

03:34.570 --> 03:35.840
Um...

03:42.079 --> 03:43.114
True?

03:43.146 --> 03:44.414
It doesn't work.

03:44.448 --> 03:45.415
- The app's not ready yet.
- What?

03:45.449 --> 03:46.584
Who... where's Benny?

03:46.616 --> 03:47.784
3:30, you know him.

03:47.818 --> 03:48.753
Like clockwork, nature calls.

03:49.653 --> 03:51.655
Jesus, Benny,
you could set a clock

03:51.687 --> 03:52.722
<i>to your bowel movements.</i>

03:52.756 --> 03:53.790
I take dumps.

03:53.824 --> 03:54.725
<i>I don't have bowel movements.</i>

03:54.758 --> 03:56.126
We can't go up there.
The app isn't working.

03:56.159 --> 03:57.395
What are you talking about?

03:57.427 --> 03:58.596
The beta tests
are going incredible.

03:58.628 --> 03:59.829
The algorithm
still needs some tweaking.

03:59.862 --> 04:00.963
It's not matching me
with the right girls.

04:00.997 --> 04:03.433
<i>This is no time
to be second-guessing our...</i>

04:04.735 --> 04:07.505
Wait.
It happened again?

04:07.538 --> 04:10.174
How the hell are you still
awkward around chicks, bro?

04:10.206 --> 04:12.810
Someday, you gotta come out
from behind the screen

04:12.842 --> 04:14.043
<i>and learn how to talk to women.</i>

04:14.076 --> 04:16.112
Shut up, Kiki!
I can talk to women.

04:16.146 --> 04:17.515
<i>Your names, please?</i>

04:19.817 --> 04:22.552
I'm...

04:23.653 --> 04:25.689
This is True Andrews...

04:25.721 --> 04:27.557
I'm Benjamin Vaswani.

04:27.591 --> 04:29.192
And this is
our lawyer, Kiki.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.461
Ahem.

04:30.494 --> 04:32.897
<i>I mean, Enrique.
Calderon.</i>

04:32.930 --> 04:36.199
Yes, here you are. Mr. Woods
is on the sixth floor.

04:36.233 --> 04:37.701
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:39.536 --> 04:40.805
<i>Remember what we practiced.</i>

04:40.838 --> 04:41.706
<i>You see a pretty girl in there,</i>

04:41.738 --> 04:43.706
you imagine that girl's
head on a turkey,

04:43.740 --> 04:46.110
your grandma...
twerking,

04:46.142 --> 04:49.212
but you do not lose your cool
in this meeting!

04:49.245 --> 04:50.447
You hear me?

04:52.249 --> 04:53.451
I'll see you guys
up there.

04:53.483 --> 04:54.517
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, hey!

04:54.550 --> 04:56.052
That's six flights up, dude.

04:56.086 --> 04:58.456
Fear of women,
fear of enclosed spaces.

04:58.488 --> 05:00.757
You have a fear
of success too?

05:00.790 --> 05:02.427
This is all in your head.
You know this.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.129
I don't have
achievemephobia.

05:05.161 --> 05:07.063
But Claustrophobia
and Venustraphobia

05:07.096 --> 05:08.064
are real conditions.

05:08.098 --> 05:09.167
Ask my doctor.

05:10.533 --> 05:11.968
Your pediatrician
doesn't count!

05:14.904 --> 05:15.972
<i>I'd like to thank you all</i>

05:16.005 --> 05:18.875
for linking your social media
profiles in advance.

05:18.908 --> 05:20.978
"Compatible" now has
enough information

05:21.011 --> 05:22.546
to find each of you a match.

05:22.579 --> 05:25.716
So, all I have to do
is press this little heart?

05:25.749 --> 05:27.551
Yes, Mr. Woods.

05:27.584 --> 05:29.519
Call me Maximillion.

05:29.552 --> 05:32.956
Yes, Mr. Maximillion.
Please touch the hearts

05:32.990 --> 05:35.259
and watch "Compatible"
find your match.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.161
We've taken
your profile information

05:37.194 --> 05:40.230
and caused it to create
over 25 points of compatibility

05:40.264 --> 05:42.500
including daily routines,
food preferences,

05:42.533 --> 05:43.867
likes and shares,

05:43.901 --> 05:45.836
to match you with someone
who likes the same things.

05:45.869 --> 05:48.772
Well, I doubt
it could find a match for me

05:48.805 --> 05:52.141
'cause I'm a man
of EXTRAORDINARY taste

05:52.175 --> 05:54.078
and bizarre pleasures.

05:55.144 --> 05:56.746
Oh, wow!

06:00.016 --> 06:01.552
<i>Aaahh!</i>

06:05.588 --> 06:07.190
"Compatible"...

06:07.223 --> 06:08.925
can find someone for everyone.

06:08.959 --> 06:11.762
Wait, who the heck is...

06:11.795 --> 06:13.730
Betty?

06:22.673 --> 06:24.942
Extraordinary!

06:24.975 --> 06:26.610
I don't have any matches.

06:26.642 --> 06:29.145
You won't always find a partner
within close proximity...

06:29.178 --> 06:30.313
But you can adjust this

06:30.346 --> 06:31.882
by changing your environment.

06:31.915 --> 06:33.617
Take the dog for a walk,
for example.

06:33.649 --> 06:35.818
Or go get a cup of coffee.

06:35.851 --> 06:38.021
My partner, True Andrews,

06:38.055 --> 06:39.189
will now talk a little more

06:39.221 --> 06:41.291
about the future of
"Compatible";

06:41.324 --> 06:45.194
the art of letting love
find you.

06:45.228 --> 06:48.331
The soft launch of "Compatible"
was successful

06:48.365 --> 06:50.901
with 100,000 downloads
in just a few hours.

06:50.934 --> 06:53.837
We're now in Mexico, Canada,

06:53.870 --> 06:55.838
and soon to be launching
in Japan and Europe.

06:55.872 --> 06:57.107
<i>How do you
propose to sustain</i>

06:57.139 --> 06:59.108
market penetration
and market share

06:59.141 --> 07:00.843
when your competitors
have deep pockets

07:00.877 --> 07:01.978
and are years ahead?

07:02.012 --> 07:03.346
Well, the unique features

07:03.379 --> 07:05.649
that combine
proximity with routine

07:05.682 --> 07:07.985
make potential love matches
that other apps don't.

07:08.017 --> 07:10.053
Well, it figured
I'm a germaphobe

07:10.086 --> 07:12.990
and it matched me
with the cleaning lady.

07:13.023 --> 07:15.326
I mean, that is pretty neat.
It really is.

07:15.358 --> 07:18.795
That's like up there
on the list of neat.

07:18.829 --> 07:22.833
Julie, uh, be sure
to get her phone number

07:22.865 --> 07:27.137
because I want to test
this theory tonight.

07:27.170 --> 07:29.372
Hmm?

07:42.285 --> 07:45.122
Sorry I'm late.

07:45.154 --> 07:46.790
Her head on a turkey.

07:50.726 --> 07:52.262
Hi, True.

07:54.297 --> 07:55.633
Um... ahem.

07:55.665 --> 07:59.403
Um... the um... the algorithm
of "Compatible"

07:59.435 --> 08:02.872
takes the... the guesswork
out of... of going out.

08:02.906 --> 08:06.276
No more striking out because
now you only approach people

08:06.309 --> 08:08.178
that actually want to
talk to you.

08:08.211 --> 08:11.215
Yeah. Ooohh oh.

08:11.247 --> 08:13.050
Twerking, man.

08:16.218 --> 08:18.254
Ahem.

08:18.288 --> 08:19.389
Mm.

08:24.927 --> 08:26.797
Oh.

08:26.829 --> 08:31.334
Um-um, no more lonely nights
swiping left and... and right

08:31.367 --> 08:34.004
and hoping,
because with "Compatible",

08:34.037 --> 08:36.840
it can even help
even the most awkward person

08:36.873 --> 08:39.176
find love with just a simple
touch of the boobs...

08:40.177 --> 08:41.311
I was...
I was going to say... I...

08:41.344 --> 08:42.312
Hmm...

08:50.921 --> 08:53.057
I am so sorry.

08:53.090 --> 08:55.192
Don't! Just don't!

08:56.493 --> 08:58.028
We just lost
millions of dollars

08:58.061 --> 09:00.096
because you're
mentally 12 years old.

09:00.129 --> 09:01.264
I'll fix it.
I'll call...

09:01.298 --> 09:03.167
No! You will
not make this worse!

09:03.200 --> 09:04.235
I'm not gonna make this worse!

09:04.268 --> 09:07.071
Sometimes I wonder why
I ever partnered with you.

09:07.104 --> 09:09.038
You do this every time!

09:09.072 --> 09:10.139
Hey!

09:10.173 --> 09:11.741
Come on.
I don't do this every time.

09:11.774 --> 09:13.876
Remember in college
when I fell in the pool and I...

09:13.909 --> 09:15.778
and I was floundering around
like some helpless animal

09:15.812 --> 09:17.047
and... and you still got laid?

09:17.080 --> 09:18.415
Hey! Hey! Hey! Shut up!

09:18.447 --> 09:20.049
They're calling. It's them!

09:23.186 --> 09:24.254
Enrique Calderon.

09:25.889 --> 09:27.124
Yes.

09:27.157 --> 09:28.926
Uh-huh.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.094
Of course.

09:31.128 --> 09:32.930
I'll tell them.

09:32.962 --> 09:34.064
Thank you.

09:42.072 --> 09:43.774
KIKI?

09:43.807 --> 09:46.176
Don't make me climb back there
and beat it out of you.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.443
Spit it out!

09:47.476 --> 09:49.746
Well, looks like
you've done it again.

09:51.081 --> 09:53.884
After all those hours
of hard work,

09:53.917 --> 09:55.985
they want to invest in the app!

10:04.827 --> 10:07.831
Oooh-oh.

10:07.864 --> 10:10.801
To the two luckiest
bastards I know.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.235
You know what?
You know what?

10:12.269 --> 10:15.538
This milestone requires
a much bigger celebration.

10:15.572 --> 10:17.240
What'd you have in mind?

10:17.274 --> 10:21.410
A-a-a full-on gods
of Hollywood weekend, bitches!

10:21.443 --> 10:22.478
Yeah!

10:22.511 --> 10:23.546
I have a client

10:23.580 --> 10:25.549
who has a fat pad
on the Sunset Strip.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.250
Says I can use it
whenever I want.

10:27.283 --> 10:28.351
Let's go.

10:28.384 --> 10:30.153
- Yeah!
- I mean, I... I'd love to, guys.

10:30.187 --> 10:32.121
but the app's still not
a hundred percent.

10:32.154 --> 10:33.856
Um, you know, you two go.

10:33.889 --> 10:36.393
I'm just gonna stay
and work on the app.

10:36.426 --> 10:37.927
What? Are you joking?

10:37.961 --> 10:40.096
Hell yes,
I'm joking!

10:40.129 --> 10:41.932
We're going to LA.

11:47.297 --> 11:48.532
Angelica?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.468
Uh-uh, I'm True.

11:54.571 --> 11:56.206
I can't believe
we're a match.

12:00.943 --> 12:04.213
Are you there with them?
They're with you?

12:04.246 --> 12:05.514
<i>No hablo inglès.</i>

12:09.318 --> 12:10.420
You don't speak English?

12:12.022 --> 12:13.423
Oh, my gosh!

12:13.456 --> 12:14.557
I'm so stupid.
Of course!

12:14.591 --> 12:16.225
I... I forgot to add
a language quotient

12:16.259 --> 12:17.260
to the match variable.

12:18.528 --> 12:20.464
That's... that's
probably a good thing

12:20.496 --> 12:22.899
because I'm usually
really bad with girls.

12:22.932 --> 12:24.333
I mean,
I... I... I talk too much.

12:24.366 --> 12:25.635
When I get nervous,
I say the wrong thing.

12:25.668 --> 12:26.603
But not right now,

12:26.636 --> 12:28.304
probably because I'm
a little bit hammered.

12:28.337 --> 12:29.972
I mean, I'm not wasted.

12:30.005 --> 12:31.540
I mean, I'm not like
I'm an alcoholic or anything.

12:35.144 --> 12:37.581
You wanna...
you like dance? Dance?

12:38.682 --> 12:40.283
<i>Si.</i>

12:40.317 --> 12:41.652
Cool.

13:21.457 --> 13:23.159
Oh!

13:36.038 --> 13:37.540
An- <i>hel-</i> ica.

13:37.573 --> 13:40.043
An- <i>hel-</i> ica.

13:40.076 --> 13:41.278
True.

13:41.311 --> 13:42.312
True.

13:42.345 --> 13:43.480
True.

13:43.513 --> 13:44.682
T-r-r-r-oo.

13:48.485 --> 13:49.385
Your mouth is so cute

13:49.419 --> 13:51.688
when you try and say my name,
An-HHHHHelica.

13:53.089 --> 13:55.192
<i>Te ves tan raro
diciendo mi nombre.</i>

13:58.193 --> 14:00.197
<i>¿Angelica,</i>

14:00.230 --> 14:03.366
<i>dónde está la biblioteca?</i>

14:03.399 --> 14:06.135
<i>No sé.</i>

14:06.168 --> 14:08.004
<i>Eres gracioso.</i>

14:12.042 --> 14:14.110
<i>Dos tacos por favor.</i>

14:16.046 --> 14:18.348
<i>¿No mas dos?</i>

14:18.380 --> 14:21.617
<i>Uno, dos.</i>

14:21.650 --> 14:23.152
Ah.

14:27.356 --> 14:28.759
Will you take
a selfie with me?

14:39.101 --> 14:40.269
Angelica...

14:40.302 --> 14:42.405
<i>ya llego el coche.</i>

14:42.438 --> 14:45.708
<i>Lo siento.</i>

14:45.741 --> 14:49.712
<i>Me tengo que ir.
Me diverti mucho.</i>

14:59.589 --> 15:02.159
Ooohh la la.
Way to go, True!

15:02.192 --> 15:03.626
My brother!

15:08.130 --> 15:09.565
What happened?

15:09.599 --> 15:10.801
She gave me her address.

15:10.833 --> 15:13.436
- Yeah!
- Noooo!

15:13.470 --> 15:14.638
High-five!

15:22.177 --> 15:24.413
This looks amazing.

15:34.356 --> 15:37.726
What's up, player?
Huh? Huh?

15:37.759 --> 15:38.828
Did you text her back yet?

15:38.861 --> 15:40.496
No, I didn't text her back.

15:40.529 --> 15:42.131
Last night was a fluke.

15:42.164 --> 15:43.632
Were we even
at the same club last night?

15:43.666 --> 15:45.535
Yeah. I had
an 80 percent match,

15:45.567 --> 15:46.735
but she doesn't
speak English.

15:46.769 --> 15:48.138
How does that work?

15:48.171 --> 15:49.506
The less she can understand you,
the better.

15:49.538 --> 15:50.706
And how long
does that last?

15:50.740 --> 15:52.174
What happens when
she learns English

15:52.207 --> 15:53.677
or I learn Spanish?

15:53.710 --> 15:55.412
Then I make a fool out of myself
in two languages?

15:55.445 --> 15:56.646
- No thanks.
- <i>True?</i>

15:56.678 --> 15:58.314
Please tell me
you're kidding!

15:58.347 --> 15:59.281
You know what I blame?

15:59.315 --> 16:00.350
Yeah. We know!

16:00.383 --> 16:01.518
- The algorithm!
- The algorithm!

16:01.551 --> 16:03.253
I told you.
It's not ready.

16:03.285 --> 16:05.754
I should've
figured this out sooner.

16:05.788 --> 16:07.257
Oh, my gosh!

16:07.289 --> 16:08.557
What if Maximillion's team
finds out?

16:08.591 --> 16:09.625
Then... then we could lose
the whole deal.

16:09.658 --> 16:13.196
Whoa! Stop right there.

16:13.229 --> 16:15.398
Don't ever let those words
come out of your mouth again.

16:15.431 --> 16:18.235
Dude, "Compatible"
matched you at 80 percent.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.704
You owe it to yourself
to at least believe it!

16:20.736 --> 16:22.371
But it's ignoring
the national distinctions

16:22.404 --> 16:23.372
in our launch region.

16:23.405 --> 16:25.307
So what? Was she hot?

16:25.341 --> 16:26.509
Yes.

16:26.543 --> 16:28.245
Then "Compatible" is fine
just the way it is.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.546
Now, get in the car!

16:29.578 --> 16:31.548
We're still celebrating.

16:33.750 --> 16:34.750
Back seat!

16:36.485 --> 16:37.854
Did he just call
back seat?

16:37.886 --> 16:38.821
Yep.

16:38.855 --> 16:40.856
<i>Tonight, we ride!</i>

16:40.889 --> 16:43.659
- <i>You're a unique one, Kiki.</i>

16:49.499 --> 16:51.600
This place is massive!
It has at least ten bedrooms.

16:51.634 --> 16:53.436
I bet you we could fit like
a hundred people in there.

16:53.469 --> 16:54.504
We can have a party...

16:55.938 --> 16:57.274
- What the hell, man!
- True!

16:57.307 --> 16:58.108
You guys are right.

16:58.140 --> 17:00.176
If the algorithm
is fine the way it is,

17:00.210 --> 17:01.478
then I'm the one
that's wrong.

17:01.510 --> 17:03.746
Maybe language isn't
a barrier for love.

17:03.779 --> 17:05.882
I need to see Angelica.
We're going to Mexico.

17:05.914 --> 17:07.750
- You sure?
- Yes! Let's go. Now.

17:07.784 --> 17:08.752
Take this exit.

17:08.785 --> 17:09.819
That's my boy.

17:09.852 --> 17:11.188
That's what
I like to hear.

17:11.221 --> 17:13.656
Hell, yeah!
Let's go to Mexico, bros!

17:13.690 --> 17:15.458
- Whoooo!
- Whoooo!

17:15.490 --> 17:16.692
Yes! Yes!

17:16.726 --> 17:17.894
- Whoa...
- Whoa, whoa...

17:17.925 --> 17:19.627
- Oh, sorry.
- Chips all over me.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.923
What the hell, Kiki?
There's no spare!

18:20.957 --> 18:22.993
I knew I shouldn't have gotten
a car from your shady uncle.

18:23.026 --> 18:24.561
Should've asked for
the spare tire option.

18:24.594 --> 18:26.395
Spare tire's not an option!

18:26.429 --> 18:27.964
Man, this is what I get
for trying to be impulsive.

18:41.877 --> 18:42.878
<i>¿Todo bien?</i>

18:42.912 --> 18:44.047
I got this.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.682
<i>Tenemos un flat tire.</i>

18:48.317 --> 18:49.519
You guys gonna be okay?

18:49.551 --> 18:50.919
Oh, we don't
have a spare.

18:50.952 --> 18:52.422
Do you know where
we can get one?

18:52.454 --> 18:53.956
There's one place
here in Valle.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.858
Your best bet is Juan.

18:55.892 --> 18:58.628
Flat tire in the middle
of a vineyard?

18:58.661 --> 19:00.964
Looks like you boys
are in a grape jam.

19:02.898 --> 19:04.967
No worries, boys.
We'll give you a lift.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.670
But first, we have to
drop off this load

19:06.702 --> 19:08.370
up at Encuentro Regina.

19:08.403 --> 19:10.839
That's exactly the place
we're looking for.

19:10.873 --> 19:11.908
I'm True Andrews.

19:11.941 --> 19:13.009
True.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.510
Uh, this is Benny.
This is Kiki.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.746
My name's Karina Salas,
and this is Sabi Segovia.

19:16.778 --> 19:19.615
We're pretty full
with groceries, but, um,

19:19.648 --> 19:21.484
one of you's gonna have to
ride on each other's lap.

19:29.959 --> 19:31.461
How is this winning?

19:31.493 --> 19:32.861
Just don't get too happy.

19:32.894 --> 19:35.898
So, what brings you boys
to Encuentro Regina?

19:35.932 --> 19:37.334
I'm here to see a girl
who lives here.

19:37.366 --> 19:38.734
<i>Really?</i>

19:38.768 --> 19:42.471
Only Regina, the owner,
and myself live there full time.

19:42.505 --> 19:43.840
What's this girl's name?

19:43.873 --> 19:45.409
Angelica.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.011
Whoa! What's that look?

19:49.045 --> 19:50.580
Nothing.

19:50.613 --> 19:52.615
Um, it's just Angelica
is the niece of the owner.

19:52.647 --> 19:55.384
Uh, Regina's the only
woman in the valley

19:55.417 --> 19:57.986
to own and run
her own winery,

19:58.019 --> 20:00.824
<i>and she's very protective
of her family.</i>

20:00.856 --> 20:03.526
And Sabi is very protective
of Dona Regina.

20:03.558 --> 20:05.127
He's also the head vintner,

20:05.161 --> 20:06.629
and has won the house
many medals

20:06.662 --> 20:08.131
for his lovely wines.
Haven't you, Sabi?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.633
And Karina
is an amazing chef.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.371
Wait, so how did you
meet Angelica?

20:14.403 --> 20:16.071
I met her last night
in San Diego.

20:16.105 --> 20:18.107
And you came
to see her today?

20:18.141 --> 20:20.410
<i>Este buey esta enamorado!</i>

20:21.743 --> 20:22.978
Loco for sure, right?

20:23.011 --> 20:23.946
<i>You must've really hit it off</i>

20:23.980 --> 20:25.382
<i>for her to invite you today.</i>

20:25.414 --> 20:28.050
Mm, she didn't
exactly invite us.

20:28.084 --> 20:31.554
This is a surprise visit?

20:31.586 --> 20:33.655
<i>You are one brave boy.</i>

20:33.689 --> 20:35.091
When True gets
something in his mind,

20:35.124 --> 20:36.826
it's impossible
to talk him out of it.

20:36.858 --> 20:37.993
It's his gift.

20:38.027 --> 20:39.395
And his curse.

20:39.429 --> 20:41.131
Well, good for you, <i>mijo,</i>

20:41.163 --> 20:44.500
'cause love makes
<i>pendejos</i> of us all.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.803
Oh, I'm sure she's gonna be
really happy to see you,

20:46.836 --> 20:48.171
and you can sample
our restaurant

20:48.203 --> 20:50.038
and enjoy Sabi's wines.

20:50.071 --> 20:51.607
Here we are.

21:26.709 --> 21:27.844
Ah!

21:32.548 --> 21:33.549
<i>This is beautiful.</i>

21:35.518 --> 21:38.788
What!
There's a band here, man.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.523
<i>This is like Shangri-La.</i>

21:42.557 --> 21:44.661
This is amazing.

21:44.693 --> 21:45.795
Wow.

21:45.827 --> 21:47.431
- Oh my God.
- Holy crap.

21:50.866 --> 21:52.134
<i>Are you guys hungry?</i>

21:52.167 --> 21:54.002
Oh. Yeah, we're hungry, thirsty,

21:54.036 --> 21:56.239
and culinarily curious.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.706
Come on over.

22:04.881 --> 22:05.982
So, you're a chef, huh?

22:06.015 --> 22:07.116
Oh no, no.
I'm just a line cook,

22:07.150 --> 22:09.552
but I'm studying at the Culinary
Institute in Ensenada

22:09.585 --> 22:11.621
so hopefully one day
I'll have my own kitchen.

22:11.653 --> 22:13.957
Oh, wow! What...
what do you recommend?

22:13.990 --> 22:15.724
How about I send out
some appetizers?

22:15.758 --> 22:18.161
Great!
Well, just bring a variety

22:18.193 --> 22:21.163
and whatever bottle of wine
you recommend.

22:21.196 --> 22:22.798
Oh, and could you
let Angelica know

22:22.832 --> 22:24.234
that True is here to see her.

22:24.267 --> 22:25.701
Wait, not right now.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.069
I mean, if she's busy...
it's not... I mean... I...

22:27.103 --> 22:28.971
if I'm not... it...
it doesn't... you...

22:29.005 --> 22:30.673
Surprise.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.208
Just let her know, please.

22:33.241 --> 22:35.479
Okay. I'll see
if I can find her.

22:36.811 --> 22:40.115
Can't wait to taste
what you've got... like food.

22:41.717 --> 22:43.086
Dude, what if
she's weirded out?

22:43.118 --> 22:44.653
I mean, wouldn't you
be freaked out

22:44.686 --> 22:45.754
if some guy you met
the night before

22:45.788 --> 22:46.955
showed up
at your place of work?

22:46.989 --> 22:48.625
I would.

22:48.657 --> 22:49.858
I did not think this through.

22:49.892 --> 22:52.596
Just calm down, man.
You're too wound up.

23:01.037 --> 23:02.905
You've no idea
what you're doing, do you?

23:02.939 --> 23:04.841
Nope, not one bit.

23:04.874 --> 23:07.175
I saw this in that movie
<i>Sideways.</i>

23:07.209 --> 23:10.013
Ugh, anyway, it's alcohol, bro.
It's all good.

23:10.046 --> 23:13.316
Cheers guys, to
success in our endeavors.

23:13.348 --> 23:14.283
- Eyes.
- Eyes, eyes.

23:14.317 --> 23:15.585
- Eyes.
- Eyes.

23:19.087 --> 23:21.190
Ah, wow! That is good.

23:21.222 --> 23:23.058
Damn good.

23:23.092 --> 23:25.828
This was a great idea
to come out here, True.

23:25.861 --> 23:27.797
I mean,
now that we have our deal,

23:27.829 --> 23:29.765
we've gotta start
getting used to this lifestyle.

23:29.798 --> 23:30.966
Don't jinx it, bro.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.268
It ain't done
'til the ink is dry.

23:32.300 --> 23:34.102
Guys, let's focus
on the task at hand.

23:34.135 --> 23:36.705
Okay. I see it like this.

23:36.739 --> 23:40.009
A. She will see you
and like what most women do,

23:40.041 --> 23:41.144
make a run for it.

23:41.176 --> 23:42.978
Thanks.

23:43.011 --> 23:45.981
Or B. She'll be flattered
when Karina tells her

23:46.015 --> 23:48.051
that someone drove
for two hours,

23:48.084 --> 23:50.874
dealt with a flat tire
to come find her.

23:51.943 --> 23:57.000
But they came from San Diego and got
a flat tire. I can't ask them to leave.

23:58.086 --> 24:01.231
Tell them that I got sick, and I'm not here.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.292
Why did you give him your information
If you didn't want to see him?

24:04.333 --> 24:06.542
I was drunk!

24:06.583 --> 24:08.750
And I wanted to have fun for one night.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.667
Besides, he was nice...

24:11.708 --> 24:13.333
and I never thought he would come.

24:13.375 --> 24:18.292
You suck. They seem nice.
The chubby one is a bit fresh, but...

24:18.333 --> 24:19.982
They seemed alright.

24:20.016 --> 24:23.920
<i>Mm. Okay.</i>

24:23.954 --> 24:26.875
Ok. Go find out what they do for a living.

24:26.917 --> 24:29.583
I don't want another bum in my life.
My parents would kill me.

24:30.750 --> 24:34.542
Yes? Please? I owe you one.

24:34.583 --> 24:35.898
One thousand.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.801
Did you find her?

24:38.834 --> 24:39.869
Oh, Angelica
is actually taking care

24:39.902 --> 24:41.371
of some important business,

24:41.403 --> 24:44.106
but she wanted me to bring
some of her favorite appetizers.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.209
She's here? Great.

24:46.241 --> 24:47.309
What's this dish?

24:47.343 --> 24:48.745
<i>Chimichurri octopus.</i>

24:48.778 --> 24:51.314
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

24:52.748 --> 24:53.582
Karina, would you
like to sit down?

24:53.615 --> 24:56.185
Um, okay.
Um, but just for a moment.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.123
This is amazing! How!

25:00.155 --> 25:02.858
It's actually
one of my favorites.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.428
So, what's your story?

25:05.461 --> 25:10.400
Oh, he's a computer geek,
he's a business stiff,

25:10.432 --> 25:14.136
and my name is Enrique Calderón,
Attorney at Law.

25:14.170 --> 25:15.038
Pleased to meet you.

25:16.439 --> 25:18.106
True and I have been
business partners for years

25:18.140 --> 25:19.409
and we developed a dating app.

25:19.442 --> 25:20.376
That's cool.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.311
I can't bring myself
to get on those sites.

25:22.344 --> 25:23.946
I feel like a bunch of creeps
get on them.

25:23.979 --> 25:25.213
- I'm on there.
- Exactly.

25:26.182 --> 25:27.950
<i>We just landed
a big investor.</i>

25:27.982 --> 25:29.418
That's why we're here,
to celebrate.

25:29.451 --> 25:30.920
That's part of the reason
why we're here.

25:30.952 --> 25:32.320
Right. Angelica.

25:32.354 --> 25:33.890
<i>Last night,
the app matched them</i>

25:33.923 --> 25:35.223
and he's here to see

25:35.257 --> 25:36.793
if the connection
is a fluke or not.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.960
Because if it was a fluke,

25:37.992 --> 25:39.194
that means
your app doesn't work.

25:39.228 --> 25:41.029
See? Karina gets it.

25:41.063 --> 25:42.098
Yes, exactly!

25:42.131 --> 25:44.367
She's a genius.
You're a genius.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.436
So, uh, what's her story?

25:46.469 --> 25:47.703
I thought you would know
everything about her

25:47.737 --> 25:49.038
based on your app.

25:49.070 --> 25:51.006
You can never know everything.

25:51.039 --> 25:53.809
I mean, tell me something
I wouldn't know about her.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.211
She's a good person.

25:56.244 --> 25:59.081
Okay, um, she's here from
Mexico City for a short while

25:59.115 --> 26:01.150
<i>to learn the wine business.</i>

26:01.182 --> 26:02.751
Aunt Regina's husband
passed away

26:02.785 --> 26:04.220
and they never had any kids.

26:04.252 --> 26:06.455
So I think she's being prepared
to inherit the business.

26:06.489 --> 26:10.293
Ooohh, an heiress.
Not too shabby, True.

26:10.326 --> 26:11.094
<i>Looks like
this match turned out</i>

26:11.126 --> 26:13.930
better than we thought, huh?

26:13.962 --> 26:15.464
Listen, guys, I gotta
get back to the kitchen,

26:15.498 --> 26:16.798
but I'm gonna send
more appetizers your way.

26:16.832 --> 26:18.334
Thank you.

26:20.402 --> 26:21.871
Wow! To life.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.417
They are the owners of Compatible.

26:27.792 --> 26:31.042
They are the owners of the app?

26:31.083 --> 26:34.483
Yes. They created it. So they're not bums,
They have jobs and money.

26:52.968 --> 26:54.269
<i>¡Hola!</i>

26:54.303 --> 26:55.305
<i>¡Hola!</i>

26:56.292 --> 26:58.239
Fancy seeing you here.

26:58.273 --> 27:02.778
Uh-um, sorry for
dropping in on you like this.

27:02.811 --> 27:05.113
We were gonna go
to Los Angeles,

27:05.146 --> 27:07.115
but then we decided
to come here.

27:07.148 --> 27:09.017
I was like, "Hey,
let's go see Angelica."

27:09.050 --> 27:11.019
And then... so we got a car,
then we got a flat,

27:11.053 --> 27:13.956
and I rode on Kiki's lap,
which he oddly liked.

27:13.989 --> 27:16.925
But then now you're here and uh,
I'm here and we're... wow!

27:16.959 --> 27:19.061
You're... you...
you look good.

27:19.094 --> 27:21.230
Dude, she only speaks Spanish.

27:21.262 --> 27:22.264
Thank God.

27:24.875 --> 27:27.470
- Come with me.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:31.507 --> 27:34.043
It's sweet.

27:46.488 --> 27:48.158
I just had to come see you.

27:55.463 --> 27:57.099
<i>Gracias.</i>

28:07.576 --> 28:08.944
Thanks.

28:14.516 --> 28:16.385
- Cheers.
- <i>Salud.</i>

28:19.288 --> 28:21.557
Oh, you're looking me
in the eye.

28:21.589 --> 28:23.326
You must know about
the seven years of bad sex

28:23.358 --> 28:25.360
in Mexico too, huh?

28:25.394 --> 28:26.996
<i>¿Sexo?</i>

28:27.028 --> 28:28.597
No. No, no, no. No <i>sexo.</i>

28:28.631 --> 28:30.500
I mean... I... I mean
eyes like, um...

28:31.875 --> 28:33.534
Calm down, True.

28:33.568 --> 28:35.070
Mm...

28:37.125 --> 28:38.072
I have an idea.

28:38.106 --> 28:39.366
Mhmm.

28:41.242 --> 28:43.980
Oh whoa!

28:44.012 --> 28:45.013
No <i>sexo.</i>

28:45.583 --> 28:46.780
Do you have your cell?

28:46.814 --> 28:49.251
Oh. Um...

28:49.285 --> 28:50.653
- Mhmm.
- Okay.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.355
I... I was... I... I thought
you were just being skanky.

28:53.388 --> 28:55.523
I would... shame...
I wouldn't have actually minded,

28:55.557 --> 28:56.625
but I um...

28:56.659 --> 28:59.295
Um... oh!

28:59.327 --> 29:01.497
Translator app.
Great idea.

29:04.465 --> 29:05.934
<i>Skanky.</i>

29:05.968 --> 29:07.603
No, no, oh. Oh, ooh. Hmm.

29:07.635 --> 29:09.372
<i>Cochina. Sucia.</i>

29:11.140 --> 29:14.477
That is not the first thing
I wanted you to understand.

29:14.509 --> 29:16.278
<i>Un poco.</i>

29:16.311 --> 29:17.346
<i>A little.</i>

29:20.415 --> 29:22.550
I love that you have
a sense of humor.

29:22.584 --> 29:24.186
Love?

29:24.219 --> 29:26.221
Uh no, no. I'm...
not like-like, love,

29:26.255 --> 29:28.024
like um... I mean, not...
I mean, not right now.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.558
I mean, maybe someday.

29:30.592 --> 29:34.663
Wow! Oh, mm, uh sex,
uh skanky, love.

29:34.696 --> 29:36.564
I'm really hitting it
out of the park, aren't I?

29:39.268 --> 29:41.470
- Oh man.
- Ehm...

29:41.502 --> 29:44.139
<i>Tengo que regresar a trabajar.</i>

29:44.173 --> 29:45.274
<i>I have to get back to work.</i>

29:46.575 --> 29:49.111
Maybe I could...
I could see you after work?

29:49.144 --> 29:51.579
<i>Te puedo
ver despues del trabajo?</i>

29:51.613 --> 29:53.615
<i>No puedo.</i>

29:53.648 --> 29:54.616
<i>I can't.</i>

29:56.184 --> 29:57.252
Yeah.

29:57.286 --> 29:59.422
<i>Tal vez Mañana.</i>

30:01.457 --> 30:04.160
<i>Me puedes acompañar
si queires.</i>

30:04.192 --> 30:05.094
<i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>

30:05.127 --> 30:07.262
<i>I'm going to check out
the competition.</i>

30:07.296 --> 30:09.432
<i>You can join me
if you'd like.</i>

30:09.464 --> 30:10.598
Really? Yes!

30:10.632 --> 30:12.634
I'd... I'd...
I'd love to. Yeah.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.636
<i>¿Nos vemos a las diez?</i>

30:14.670 --> 30:16.138
- Uh... ten?
- Mhmm.

30:16.171 --> 30:18.574
Yes, I'll... I'll meet you
here. Or there or...

30:18.606 --> 30:19.975
Anywhere really

30:20.009 --> 30:21.076
that you are at.

30:21.109 --> 30:21.943
I'll be there.

30:21.978 --> 30:23.412
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:23.444 --> 30:24.646
- See you then.
- Bye.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.149
Ten, bye.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.292
Who's that?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.542
A friend.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.435
A friend? With those hungry eyes?

30:38.469 --> 30:39.708
Oh, Auntie.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.500
Look, your parents sent you here
to focus on business.

30:42.542 --> 30:45.417
Not to keep losing your head
over another boy.

30:45.567 --> 30:47.792
But Auntie, this time It's different.

30:47.833 --> 30:49.958
He's not a poor boy like Daniel.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.417
It's not important what he has
or what Daniel doesn't have.

30:55.458 --> 31:00.750
What's important is what you have
when there isn't a Daniel or a...

31:00.792 --> 31:02.518
- What's his name?
- True.

31:29.478 --> 31:31.114
<i>Wow! Sabi's got some moves.</i>

31:32.213 --> 31:33.182
There you guys are.

31:33.214 --> 31:34.250
Speaking of moves,

31:34.282 --> 31:35.317
how'd it go?

31:35.349 --> 31:36.818
Seeing her
tomorrow at ten.

31:36.852 --> 31:38.586
- Nice!
- No, you're not.

31:38.619 --> 31:40.388
We're leaving tonight.

31:40.422 --> 31:41.624
We...

31:41.656 --> 31:44.592
Sorry, boys.
They didn't have the right size,

31:44.625 --> 31:47.029
but Juan's going into town
to buy the right tire tomorrow.

31:48.396 --> 31:50.365
There you go.
We can't leave anyway.

31:50.398 --> 31:52.167
We don't have
a place to stay.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.536
You say it like
it's my fault.

31:53.568 --> 31:55.471
It IS your fault.

31:55.503 --> 31:57.439
If we weren't out here
chasing some tail...

31:57.472 --> 32:00.142
Done!
They had one room left

32:00.174 --> 32:01.676
and I just booked it.

32:01.710 --> 32:05.181
So you guys shut up
and let's drink the night away.

32:05.213 --> 32:06.347
Yeah!

32:06.381 --> 32:08.250
And if you dummies
will excuse me,

32:08.282 --> 32:11.419
I have a <i>señorita</i>
who's giving me the eye, huh?

32:11.452 --> 32:12.488
Whooo!

32:42.250 --> 32:44.319
Mm, Kiki?

32:44.353 --> 32:47.156
- Ugh! Ugh, mm. Ugh...
- ooh, oh.

32:57.566 --> 32:59.802
My head is pounding.

32:59.835 --> 33:02.904
We must've been up
until four in the morning.

33:02.938 --> 33:05.174
We went to bed by 11:30.

33:05.207 --> 33:06.843
What! No way.

33:08.343 --> 33:10.579
Yep.
We shut the place down.

33:11.613 --> 33:12.882
We're party animals.

33:36.704 --> 33:37.806
Can you believe this place?

33:40.442 --> 33:42.510
Okay True,
it's do or die time.

33:42.544 --> 33:44.547
You close on this girl today
and we go home.

33:44.579 --> 33:46.048
Understand?

33:46.082 --> 33:48.517
We don't have time for this
<i>Lost in Translation</i> crap.

33:48.549 --> 33:50.919
We can always
come back, right?

33:50.952 --> 33:51.854
Uh-mm.

33:51.887 --> 33:54.423
You think Karina'll
give me her number?

33:54.455 --> 33:56.257
Sure.

33:56.290 --> 33:58.860
Let's focus on this car thing
and get some breakfast, huh?

34:24.987 --> 34:26.521
Good morning, boys.

34:26.554 --> 34:27.455
Hey, Sabi.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.659
<i>What are you doin'?</i>

34:30.692 --> 34:33.762
Um, makin' a wound
to see if it bleeds.

34:33.795 --> 34:37.364
If it releases this water-like
substance called xylem fluid,

34:37.398 --> 34:38.666
it's not ready.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.301
So, you wound the grape
to see if it's ready?

34:40.335 --> 34:42.471
Yeah. Well, a mature grape
can handle the scar.

34:44.505 --> 34:46.442
What's your plan with Angelica?

34:46.474 --> 34:48.443
Um, I'm goin' on a date
with her in a bit.

34:48.476 --> 34:50.312
After he's done,
we leave.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.781
Love can't be nurtured
with one date.

34:53.815 --> 34:56.619
Love?
Who said anything about love?

34:59.021 --> 35:01.423
Until you experience
the kind of love

35:01.456 --> 35:04.526
that punches you in the gut
and leaves you breathless

35:04.559 --> 35:06.528
with a simple thought of her,

35:06.561 --> 35:08.664
not only have you not
lived a true life,

35:08.697 --> 35:10.833
you haven't become a true man.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.806
Ah.

35:17.838 --> 35:20.275
Ah. Look at these vines.

35:20.309 --> 35:22.745
The mother vine
is a hundred years old.

35:22.777 --> 35:24.512
Came from Italy.

35:24.545 --> 35:28.750
A cutting takes three years
to make good grapes.

35:28.784 --> 35:31.019
You can't rush it, son.

35:31.052 --> 35:33.321
You can't rush love.

35:33.355 --> 35:35.423
Well, maybe you can
give True a few tips,

35:35.456 --> 35:37.058
'cause he doesn't have
a hundred years.

35:37.092 --> 35:40.528
Well, there's no more important
business than love.

35:40.561 --> 35:42.563
But you have to be patient.

35:42.597 --> 35:46.368
You have to nurture it,
savor every moment

35:46.400 --> 35:49.538
and you have to figure out
what she really wants.

35:49.570 --> 35:51.806
You know what they say
about wine and women?

35:51.840 --> 35:53.509
The cheap ones
gives you headaches.

35:53.541 --> 35:55.443
Right?

35:55.476 --> 35:58.480
When love is ready,
you will know.

36:03.485 --> 36:07.956
What's
<i>'Listo para familia',</i> mea?

36:07.989 --> 36:10.726
Oh, um, that means
she wants a guy

36:10.759 --> 36:13.329
who's ready to have a family.

36:13.362 --> 36:14.363
Yep, we should go right now.

36:14.396 --> 36:15.264
Wait a minute.

36:15.297 --> 36:17.465
I mean, I haven't
thought about it before.

36:17.498 --> 36:21.636
It hasn't been a viable option
for anyone, but yeah, sure,

36:21.670 --> 36:24.072
I-I think I'd like to
have a family someday.

36:24.106 --> 36:25.808
You want a Mexican family?

36:25.840 --> 36:27.976
Woah, woah, woah,
why do you say it like that?

36:28.009 --> 36:29.010
A Mexican family?

36:29.043 --> 36:30.278
I didn't mean it like that,

36:30.311 --> 36:33.449
but do you want to get mixed up
in all these immigration issues?

36:33.481 --> 36:35.617
I mean, things are only gonna
get harder for these people.

36:35.650 --> 36:37.385
What do mean by 'these people'?

36:37.418 --> 36:39.054
I am these people.

36:39.086 --> 36:41.889
Last I checked,
these people are your lawyer.

36:41.922 --> 36:42.924
I didn't it mean like...

36:42.958 --> 36:44.093
All right,
all right, guys,

36:44.126 --> 36:45.094
we're getting ahead
of ourselves.

36:45.126 --> 36:46.561
No one's marrying anyone.

36:46.594 --> 36:47.695
So, get to it then.

36:47.728 --> 36:48.629
Kiki and I
will go pick up the car

36:48.664 --> 36:50.799
and meet you back here
afterwards, yeah?

36:50.831 --> 36:51.866
Yeah.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.902
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Karina!

36:53.934 --> 36:55.371
Hey, good morning, guys.

36:55.403 --> 36:57.672
- <i>Morning.</i>
- Hi, good morning.

36:57.706 --> 36:59.007
Where you off to,
looking all cute

36:59.039 --> 37:00.108
with your backpack?

37:00.141 --> 37:01.076
I'm going to study.

37:01.110 --> 37:02.845
I have to prepare
for the culinary competition

37:02.878 --> 37:04.413
- in two days.
- Oh.

37:04.445 --> 37:06.714
So your homework
is to make delicious food?

37:06.748 --> 37:08.751
- Yup.
- How would you like this dog

37:08.784 --> 37:10.552
to eat your homework?

37:12.753 --> 37:14.757
So, we're actually
leaving today,

37:14.789 --> 37:17.425
and I was wondering...

37:17.458 --> 37:18.760
maybe you can give me
your phone number,

37:18.793 --> 37:20.128
- grab a drink...
- <i>Mommy!</i>

37:21.000 --> 37:23.625
Hi my love! Say hi to these boys.

37:23.659 --> 37:24.500
Hi.

37:24.532 --> 37:26.701
Hi.

37:26.735 --> 37:28.503
<i>Karina, how do I say,</i>

37:28.536 --> 37:31.873
'You're the most interesting
woman I've ever met' in Spanish?

37:31.907 --> 37:38.447
<i>Tú eres la mujer más
interesante que he conocido.</i>

37:38.480 --> 37:41.150
What about um, what about
'your eyes are beautiful'?

37:41.182 --> 37:42.583
Tell them, baby.

37:42.617 --> 37:45.120
<i>Tus ojos son muy bonitos.</i>

37:46.588 --> 37:48.590
Who do you want to say that to?

37:48.623 --> 37:50.425
<i>He has a date
with Angelica later.</i>

37:50.458 --> 37:52.794
And he doesn't speak Spanish?

37:54.996 --> 37:56.664
Any other tips I should know?

37:56.697 --> 37:58.900
How about learning some Spanish?

37:58.934 --> 38:00.002
Nice.

38:00.034 --> 38:01.803
Well, if you're here
just for fun,

38:01.836 --> 38:03.204
she's gonna smell that
a mile away

38:03.237 --> 38:04.806
and crush your balls.

38:06.541 --> 38:08.110
Crush balls. Got it.

38:08.143 --> 38:09.177
<i>Glad I could help.</i>

38:09.210 --> 38:10.445
Is your car ready?

38:10.478 --> 38:12.047
Yes. Thank you so much
for everything.

38:12.079 --> 38:12.880
<i>My pleasure.</i>

38:12.914 --> 38:14.616
It was very nice
meeting you guys.

38:14.648 --> 38:16.085
Will we be seeing you here
again soon?

38:19.019 --> 38:22.690
Me? Oh, ah, it ah, um,
yeah, I-I guess so.

38:22.724 --> 38:24.126
Yeah. Yeah, probably, yeah.

38:24.159 --> 38:25.561
Yeah.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.563
Okay then.
See you then.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.864
Nice to meet you.

38:28.896 --> 38:29.898
Bye.

38:29.931 --> 38:31.233
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:31.266 --> 38:34.202
Oh, well, too bad.

38:34.235 --> 38:36.038
I'm just not ready
to be a father yet.

38:51.708 --> 38:54.850
Welcome to Filippi Winery. Follow me please.

38:54.884 --> 38:57.092
Ready?

39:05.599 --> 39:09.137
<i>Estos tanques
son hechos de secuoya roja.</i>

39:11.572 --> 39:16.944
These tanks are made out of
2,000-year-old redwood.

39:16.978 --> 39:20.682
<i>Ah, the temperature in the...
in these tanks is controlled,</i>

39:20.715 --> 39:22.518
<i>but when the wine is ready...</i>

39:29.224 --> 39:33.458
<i>Me encata el olor de los barriles.</i>
(I love the smell of wine barrels.)

39:35.030 --> 39:37.599
<i>These barrels
that you see here are special.</i>

39:37.632 --> 39:39.534
And the owner
only lets important people

39:39.568 --> 39:41.158
to carve into the wood.

39:41.772 --> 39:47.500
If you look at the barrel over here,
you can see some signatures.

39:47.542 --> 39:51.167
That's because the owner of the winery
lets special people carve their initials...

39:55.250 --> 39:59.750
We are special people.

40:00.221 --> 40:02.023
Won't we get in trouble?

40:16.838 --> 40:18.574
This is incredible.

40:18.606 --> 40:21.050
<i>Que atrevido.</i>
(You're so daring!)

40:21.084 --> 40:22.611
You're so beautiful.

40:22.643 --> 40:25.713
And I'm so near you.
I almost can't believe it.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.117
I think I'm over my phobia.

40:32.186 --> 40:34.856
Where'd everyone go?

40:37.092 --> 40:41.697
Ah, where's True?
I'm going to wring his neck.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.998
Wait, maybe
he's closing the deal.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.769
You really don't
know True, do you?

40:47.936 --> 40:50.238
Still no reception.

40:50.271 --> 40:54.107
<i>El siguente grupo debe llegar en cualquier momento.</i>
(Don't worry. The next group will be here at any moment.)

40:54.141 --> 40:55.844
I hate enclosed spaces.

40:55.876 --> 40:57.011
<i>Estas bien?</i>
(Are you ok?)

40:57.045 --> 40:58.747
We have to
get out of the cellar.

40:58.780 --> 40:59.748
Oh, yeah.

40:59.780 --> 41:02.884
I don't know what you're saying, but calm down they're coming.

41:02.916 --> 41:04.318
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

41:04.351 --> 41:07.121
Whoo!

41:07.458 --> 41:12.125
Hey, I don't know what you're thinking,
But I'm not that kind of woman!

41:12.167 --> 41:14.667
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

41:15.875 --> 41:17.631
Pull your pants up!

41:17.665 --> 41:20.668
I'm suffocating down here!
I-I can't breathe!

41:24.304 --> 41:27.141
Ah-ha-ha!

41:29.777 --> 41:31.178
I am sorry.

41:31.211 --> 41:33.715
<i>Disculpame.</i>

41:33.748 --> 41:35.250
<i>Disculpame.</i>

41:35.282 --> 41:37.286
<i>Disculpame, disculpame,
disculpame, disculpame.</i>

41:38.750 --> 41:41.625
Here. Thanks for not arresting him.

41:41.667 --> 41:44.417
He's a little sick in the head.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.875
Thank you miss.

41:47.917 --> 41:51.866
Tell your boyfriend that we have
great psychologists in Tijuana.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.836
Of course I will.

41:57.458 --> 41:59.667
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:59.708 --> 42:02.292
Don't worry about it. Are you alright?

42:03.143 --> 42:04.145
I'm loco.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.182
That's what I told the security guard

42:11.286 --> 42:12.788
<i>Me diverti mucho.</i>

42:14.121 --> 42:15.257
<i>I enjoyed myself.</i>

42:15.289 --> 42:17.326
Really?

42:19.083 --> 42:23.458
Shall we go to Encuentro?

42:34.442 --> 42:36.911
You're <i>loco</i>
for kissing me after that.

42:39.047 --> 42:40.481
Yeah, she paid the guard

42:40.514 --> 42:42.317
with a bottle of wine
and batting her eyelashes;

42:42.349 --> 42:44.418
otherwise, I'd be
in a Mexican jail right now.

42:44.452 --> 42:45.987
That girl thought
you were perving out

42:46.019 --> 42:47.755
and it all ended
with a kiss?

42:47.789 --> 42:49.758
Oh.

42:49.791 --> 42:52.027
Your algorithm
was right all along.

42:52.059 --> 42:55.163
And now that you got it
out of your system, we could go.

42:55.195 --> 42:57.031
I still think "Compatible"
shouldn't be matching people

42:57.065 --> 42:58.432
who don't speak
the same language.

42:58.465 --> 42:59.467
<i>I mean,
how cool would it be</i>

42:59.501 --> 43:00.802
<i>if we stayed
a few more days, huh?</i>

43:00.835 --> 43:02.871
Not cool at all.

43:02.903 --> 43:05.373
Maximillion's people sent
some logistics to go over

43:05.405 --> 43:07.208
before they draw up
the contract.

43:07.242 --> 43:08.277
Hey, Karina!

43:10.512 --> 43:11.780
Hey.

43:11.813 --> 43:13.315
Hey, True.
So, how'd it go?

43:13.347 --> 43:16.250
Great. I mean, horrible,
but great.

43:16.284 --> 43:18.320
Listen, I'm gonna ask you
a strange question.

43:18.353 --> 43:19.488
I'm listening.

43:19.521 --> 43:21.156
Can you teach me Spanish?

43:21.188 --> 43:23.524
What did I tell you?

43:23.557 --> 43:24.960
That I should
learn Spanish.

43:24.992 --> 43:26.927
A-and I'm willing to pay.
I-I'm a good student.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.830
I'm a line cook.
I'm a student and I'm a mother.

43:29.864 --> 43:31.266
I'm not a Spanish teacher.

43:31.298 --> 43:33.400
Please.
I know you can do it.

43:33.434 --> 43:35.304
I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.242
Karina, please?

43:41.275 --> 43:42.476
I-I'm a quick learner.

43:42.510 --> 43:44.346
I can, I'll-I'll come
during the day.

43:44.378 --> 43:45.413
I'll just observe and learn.

43:45.445 --> 43:47.214
Aren't you leaving tonight?

43:47.248 --> 43:50.552
Um, no. I want to stay
a few more days.

43:50.585 --> 43:52.320
You can't learn Spanish
in a few days.

43:52.353 --> 43:53.954
I can learn
a few key phrases.

43:53.987 --> 43:55.990
Just enough to...
look, please? Please?

43:57.000 --> 44:01.583
Tell him $300 dollars a day.

44:01.625 --> 44:04.130
Good idea! A high price so he says no.

44:04.164 --> 44:05.300
Don't... please don't say no.

44:05.333 --> 44:06.535
I-I heard you say no.

44:06.568 --> 44:09.004
See, I'm already learning
Spanish from you.

44:09.036 --> 44:11.205
My manager says
$300 a day.

44:11.239 --> 44:13.041
Done! Yes, deal.

44:13.074 --> 44:14.442
Wait, what? No!

44:14.474 --> 44:15.409
I'm sorry.
A deal's a deal.

44:15.443 --> 44:17.012
We already fived on it.

44:17.045 --> 44:19.213
- When do we start?
- God, okay, fine.

44:19.246 --> 44:20.414
Meet me inside
in ten minutes.

44:20.447 --> 44:22.016
Awesome.

44:22.050 --> 44:23.919
I'll be the best student
you ever had.

44:23.952 --> 44:26.321
Don't worry, it's easy.

44:26.353 --> 44:29.991
I've been speaking
two languages my whole life.

44:31.391 --> 44:33.194
<i>Why the hell are you so happy?</i>

44:33.228 --> 44:34.096
Okay, don't be mad,

44:34.128 --> 44:35.429
but I'm going to stay
a few more days.

44:35.463 --> 44:37.165
What? Why?

44:37.197 --> 44:39.067
I hired a tutor.
I'm going to learn Spanish.

44:39.099 --> 44:42.069
- Wow.
- True, we came.

44:42.103 --> 44:44.039
We saw.
You didn't conquer.

44:44.072 --> 44:45.207
We're gone.

44:45.239 --> 44:46.907
I can do this, Benny.

44:46.940 --> 44:47.875
Then I'll be
a hundred percent certain

44:47.909 --> 44:49.443
I feel comfortable
not telling Maximillion

44:49.476 --> 44:51.545
- about the glitch.
- There is no glitch.

44:51.579 --> 44:55.350
If you tell him that,
you will sabotage this deal.

44:55.382 --> 44:59.253
You know what? Fine, stay.

44:59.286 --> 45:00.521
You do this every time.

45:00.554 --> 45:01.922
Do what?

45:01.956 --> 45:04.059
You leave me to take it
to the finish line.

45:04.092 --> 45:05.327
What are you talking about?

45:05.360 --> 45:06.528
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have an app.

45:06.561 --> 45:07.896
If it wasn't for me,

45:07.929 --> 45:11.266
you wouldn't have
a $10 million deal.

45:11.298 --> 45:14.969
I'm getting real tired
of picking up your slack.

45:15.003 --> 45:15.804
What's that supposed to mean?

45:15.836 --> 45:16.672
- Huh?
- Guys, guys, guys, stop. Stop.

45:16.704 --> 45:19.540
Benny, I will stay here
with him, okay?

45:19.574 --> 45:21.476
We'll work from here.

45:21.509 --> 45:22.878
Whatever.

45:22.911 --> 45:24.179
You're going to do
what you want anyway.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.889
That went well.

45:38.259 --> 45:39.461
Hmm. Come on.

45:49.036 --> 45:51.205
If she doesn't say yes,
the lesson's pointless.

45:51.239 --> 45:52.374
Sent.

45:54.242 --> 45:55.677
You think
she'll say yes?

45:55.710 --> 45:57.412
I'm five years old.

45:57.445 --> 46:00.448
I have no idea.

46:00.481 --> 46:03.451
<i>True, come antes
de que empezemos.</i>

46:03.483 --> 46:05.119
Are you talking to me?

46:05.152 --> 46:08.923
Your lesson started.
<i>Comer</i> means eat.

46:08.956 --> 46:10.525
Have something
before we start.

46:14.394 --> 46:16.398
She said no.

46:16.431 --> 46:20.235
- You're kidding.
- Yes, I am.

46:20.268 --> 46:22.403
She said to meet her here
at eight o'clock.

46:22.436 --> 46:24.371
Ah-ha!

46:24.405 --> 46:25.941
You have a mean streak
but it doesn't matter

46:25.974 --> 46:27.509
because I have a date tonight.

46:27.541 --> 46:29.710
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- If you have a date tonight,

46:29.744 --> 46:31.446
we better start the lesson.

46:31.478 --> 46:32.346
Oh, okay.

46:32.380 --> 46:38.119
A-E-I-O-U.
Let's begin with the vowels.

46:38.152 --> 46:39.287
A.

46:39.320 --> 46:42.356
No. Don't open your mouth
so wide.

46:42.389 --> 46:45.159
Smaller, like you're saying...

46:45.193 --> 46:48.563
Aw! Oh-o-oh!
There's that mean streak again.

46:48.596 --> 46:50.164
Oh, that deserves a tickle.

46:50.197 --> 46:52.232
Tickle.

46:52.266 --> 46:53.335
Get out of here, you.

46:53.367 --> 46:56.036
<i>Ah-ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah!</i>

46:56.070 --> 46:59.307
Oh man, she's too cute.

46:59.340 --> 47:00.408
Did you really strip down
to your <i>chonies</i>

47:00.440 --> 47:01.643
at the winery?

47:01.675 --> 47:02.978
You heard about that too?

47:03.010 --> 47:04.445
The whole town
heard about it.

47:04.478 --> 47:07.147
I'm really claustrophobic.

47:07.181 --> 47:10.385
I-I don't know,
I just-sometime... ah.

47:12.085 --> 47:15.622
Tacos is not a first-date food
for you, is it?

47:15.655 --> 47:16.724
You're a mess.

47:20.594 --> 47:25.000
Look, um,
you're on the right track.

47:25.032 --> 47:27.434
If a man traveled
across the border

47:27.467 --> 47:30.437
and paid way too much
to learn Spanish...

47:30.471 --> 47:31.505
I'd hit that.

47:31.539 --> 47:34.710
You're one classy dame.

47:40.248 --> 47:42.450
How do you say dog in Spanish?

47:42.483 --> 47:43.385
<i>Perro.</i>

47:45.250 --> 47:48.083
Kiki is a hair.

47:48.588 --> 47:50.525
Oh boy,
we have some work to do.

47:50.557 --> 47:52.193
Okay.

47:52.226 --> 47:54.429
Let's start with some phrases.

47:54.461 --> 47:56.130
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola.</i>

47:56.164 --> 47:57.599
- <i>Me llamo...</i>
- <i>Me llamo...</i>

47:57.632 --> 47:59.267
- True.
- True.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.135
- <i>Bien.</i>
- <i>Bien.</i>

48:01.168 --> 48:02.136
- Good job.
- Good job. Oh-ah...

48:02.170 --> 48:03.805
<i>"Muy bien"</i>
means good job.

48:03.838 --> 48:05.340
Hmm, okay.

48:05.373 --> 48:06.673
Okay.

48:06.706 --> 48:08.375
The chocolate?

48:08.409 --> 48:09.344
- No. It's high five.
- Oh.

48:09.376 --> 48:10.545
Oh.

48:17.818 --> 48:22.556
Angelica, you're beautiful.

48:22.590 --> 48:24.826
Oh, hey,
good evening, Regina.

48:24.858 --> 48:26.728
- Oh, good evening.
- Hmm.

48:26.760 --> 48:29.063
- Have you got a minute?
- Oh, yeah.

48:29.097 --> 48:30.298
- Sit down, please.
- Sure.

48:34.268 --> 48:37.105
Enrique is not
your average lawyer, is he?

48:37.137 --> 48:39.440
That's
the understatement of the year.

48:39.474 --> 48:41.109
No, ma'am.

48:41.141 --> 48:44.478
And um, I hear
you really like Valle

48:44.512 --> 48:46.280
despite the near-death
experience

48:46.313 --> 48:48.382
you had at the winery?

48:48.416 --> 48:49.484
You heard about that too?

48:49.516 --> 48:51.852
Well, everyone did.

48:51.885 --> 48:54.556
Well, I-I-I promise
not to take my clothes off

48:54.588 --> 48:56.190
for the rest of the trip.

48:56.224 --> 48:59.094
Oh, that's good.

48:59.126 --> 49:01.195
- Oh.
- You know,

49:01.228 --> 49:04.465
when I was 25 years old,

49:04.498 --> 49:08.669
my parents wanted me to marry
someone they had chosen.

49:08.702 --> 49:15.375
He came from money, education,
but I didn't love him.

49:15.409 --> 49:19.713
They tried to force a connection
that simply wasn't there.

49:21.181 --> 49:24.318
You don't think Angelica
and I have a connection?

49:24.351 --> 49:26.788
No, um...

49:26.820 --> 49:29.656
I think my niece
is not an experiment

49:29.690 --> 49:32.726
to test out the validity
of your app.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.862
No, I agree.

49:33.894 --> 49:35.362
Hmm-mm. Hmm.

49:35.396 --> 49:37.365
I-I-I'm not a bad guy.

49:37.398 --> 49:39.467
I know you're not, True.

49:39.500 --> 49:45.273
But time is something that
young people take for granted.

49:45.306 --> 49:50.278
And I need her to focus
on bigger matters.

49:50.311 --> 49:51.379
Do you understand?

49:53.880 --> 49:55.282
And...

50:01.355 --> 50:02.590
I'm sorry.

50:02.623 --> 50:03.825
Excuse me.

50:41.896 --> 50:43.664
Sorry.

50:46.400 --> 50:47.402
Karina...

50:47.434 --> 50:48.469
Hey, True.

50:48.501 --> 50:49.836
I can't do it.

50:49.869 --> 50:51.405
Do what?

50:51.438 --> 50:52.539
I'm supposed to
meet with Angelica

50:52.574 --> 50:54.809
in just a few minutes
and-and it's happening again.

50:54.842 --> 50:56.544
Like I-I'm supposed to
meet with her but like...

50:56.577 --> 50:59.480
there is like Regina and then
like I-I don't ,

50:59.512 --> 51:00.981
and I-I can't even
speak English.

51:01.014 --> 51:02.317
How am I supposed to
speak Spanish?

51:02.349 --> 51:03.717
So what?
She knows that already.

51:03.751 --> 51:04.852
No. It's-it's way worse!

51:04.885 --> 51:07.621
Like when I... when I get nervous,
I completely lose it.

51:07.655 --> 51:09.357
You have to help me.

51:09.389 --> 51:10.458
How?

51:10.490 --> 51:12.693
You have to listen in

51:12.726 --> 51:13.994
and tell me what to say.

51:14.027 --> 51:15.562
No, I'm working.

51:15.596 --> 51:17.298
How did you communicate
with her before?

51:17.331 --> 51:18.533
Over a translation app.

51:18.565 --> 51:19.866
Great. Use that.

51:19.900 --> 51:21.436
No, it's...
it's too awkward.

51:21.469 --> 51:22.836
I need to make
a good impression.

51:22.869 --> 51:24.438
Please? Please,
please, please, please...

51:24.472 --> 51:25.306
Okay. Okay, okay, okay,

51:25.340 --> 51:26.307
- I'll help you.
- Ah, thank you.

51:26.340 --> 51:27.107
But I won't translate
anything kinky, okay?

51:27.141 --> 51:28.576
- Keep it clean.
- Got it.

51:28.608 --> 51:29.811
Nothing kinky, clean.

51:29.844 --> 51:31.445
Just clean. Okay.

51:31.478 --> 51:32.413
Ah, ah, can I see
your phone please?

51:33.547 --> 51:34.416
Please, please, thank you.

51:41.289 --> 51:42.991
Okay.
We're connected.

51:43.023 --> 51:45.993
<i>Testes, testes,
ah, uno, dos, um...</i>

51:46.027 --> 51:48.396
can you give me one test
to go, please?

51:48.429 --> 51:49.831
What are you, like 12?

51:49.864 --> 51:50.831
<i>Perfect. Got it.
Thank you.</i>

52:03.978 --> 52:04.725
<i>Hola.</i>

52:04.759 --> 52:06.049
<i>Say
"Te ves muy hermosa".</i>

52:06.083 --> 52:10.167
Angelica, you're beautiful.

52:10.208 --> 52:13.920
Thank you. And you look very handsome.

52:13.954 --> 52:15.623
She just said
you look handsome.

52:15.655 --> 52:18.592
Great. I mean, <i>gracias.</i>
Um, hmm? Hmm?

52:21.792 --> 52:23.462
Thank you. What a gentleman.

52:31.472 --> 52:34.542
<i>Oye, que bien estas
hablando el Español.</i>

52:34.574 --> 52:35.942
<i>She just said
you're speaking Spanish well.</i>

52:35.976 --> 52:36.978
Say <i>práctique.</i>

52:37.625 --> 52:38.712
I practiced.

52:44.719 --> 52:46.054
Ah, everything okay?

52:48.500 --> 52:51.333
Yeah, everything's ok.

52:51.375 --> 52:52.491
An ex-boyfriend?

52:52.525 --> 52:54.995
<i>Nice.</i>

52:55.028 --> 52:58.900
Hmm, <i>sí.
Su nombre es Daniel.</i>

52:58.932 --> 52:59.934
<i>Daniel, that's his name.</i>

53:01.625 --> 53:04.071
Why you and him no more?

53:04.105 --> 53:08.543
Um, okay.

53:08.576 --> 53:11.679
<i>Es immaduro y cuando le da
selos, se porta como un bobo.</i>

53:11.711 --> 53:13.547
When he gets jealous,
he acts like an idiot.

53:13.581 --> 53:15.583
- <i>Me manda texts hablandome...</i>
- He sends her a nice text.

53:15.615 --> 53:19.653
- <i>...bonito, pero no cambia.</i>
- And then he doesn't change.

53:19.686 --> 53:20.987
Sounds like
I got like a shot.

53:21.021 --> 53:22.023
<i>Sure does.</i>

53:23.292 --> 53:24.690
Shall we take a selfie, True?

53:24.724 --> 53:26.822
Oh, y-yeah. Yeah.

53:36.137 --> 53:37.837
What a beautiful photo.

53:37.871 --> 53:38.906
It's-it's a good-looking
couple.

53:41.074 --> 53:43.043
Ah, yeah. It's good.

53:45.746 --> 53:48.048
<i>Tu si les cairías
muy bien a mis papás.</i>

53:48.081 --> 53:49.983
She said her parents
would really like you.

53:50.016 --> 53:51.085
Yeah. Ah-ah...

53:51.117 --> 53:52.420
Hey!

53:52.452 --> 53:57.525
Ah, oh, ah, please,
oh, yeah, yeah. Hmm.

54:02.042 --> 54:05.750
A toast.

54:05.792 --> 54:06.933
To old loves and new friends.

54:06.967 --> 54:07.969
<i>Gracias.</i>

54:08.003 --> 54:12.572
A toast. To son loves and egg friends.

54:18.445 --> 54:19.880
Oh, ah, ah,?

54:19.914 --> 54:21.716
No.

54:21.748 --> 54:22.750
Daniel?

54:23.333 --> 54:27.487
- Yes. He got upset over the selfie of us that I sent him.
- Hmm.

54:27.521 --> 54:29.858
Oh no, she just
sent Daniel the selfie.

54:34.208 --> 54:36.000
Do you have the pig feet?

54:36.708 --> 54:40.833
You have pig feet.

54:42.667 --> 54:44.625
Give me the tongue.

54:44.667 --> 54:46.792
Give me the tongue.

54:46.833 --> 54:47.607
Gross.

54:47.641 --> 54:48.909
Oh, no!

54:48.943 --> 54:50.512
<i>You just asked her
to give you her tongue.</i>

54:53.449 --> 54:57.516
Hey, what's that? What's in your ear?
Who are you talking to?

54:57.550 --> 54:58.418
<i>She's onto us.</i>

54:58.452 --> 54:59.821
She wants to know
what's in your ear.

54:59.853 --> 55:00.722
What do we do? I-I...

55:00.756 --> 55:01.977
What's wrong with you, True?

55:02.011 --> 55:07.762
Ah, Um... hmm-mm.

55:07.795 --> 55:09.831
Eh-huh, hey. Hmm?
Hmm-mm.

55:09.864 --> 55:11.699
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm-mm. Hmm...

55:11.731 --> 55:13.134
Is this yours?

55:13.166 --> 55:15.068
Ah, oh no.
Ah, it's not mine.

55:15.101 --> 55:17.137
I, ah, but I'll take it
to lost and found for you.

55:17.170 --> 55:18.538
No problem.

55:21.041 --> 55:22.143
Karina?

55:23.875 --> 55:26.833
The number you dialed is no longer in service.

55:37.757 --> 55:40.727
<i>A Daniel le encanta los juegos.</i>

55:40.760 --> 55:42.028
<i>Daniel liked games.</i>

55:43.697 --> 55:46.067
<i>Ya basta con niños que
les gusta perder mi tiempo.</i>

55:46.099 --> 55:47.902
<i>Necesito un hombre verdad.</i>

55:50.036 --> 55:51.838
<i>Enough with
children with their games.</i>

55:51.871 --> 55:53.740
<i>I need a real man.</i>

56:08.322 --> 56:09.757
Hey, Benny.

56:09.789 --> 56:11.125
<i>Hey, Max has some
pretty exciting news.</i>

56:11.157 --> 56:12.893
<i>I'm going to patch him
right through.</i>

56:12.927 --> 56:14.961
- Wait, no I don't...
- <i>Konichiwa, boys, I'm in Toko</i>

56:14.994 --> 56:16.297
<i>with my business partner.</i>

56:16.329 --> 56:17.731
<i>And guess what?</i>

56:17.764 --> 56:20.233
<i>He loves, absolutely
loves the app.</i>

56:20.266 --> 56:22.736
<i>So, he adores Dalmatians.</i>

56:22.769 --> 56:24.005
<i>And what happened
is that it matched him</i>

56:24.038 --> 56:26.039
<i>with a very attractive
firefighter.</i>

56:26.072 --> 56:27.275
<i>I'd say three months,</i>

56:27.307 --> 56:30.043
<i>we want to release "Compatible"
throughout Asia.</i>

56:30.077 --> 56:32.246
<i>Maximillion,
that's fantastic.</i>

56:32.278 --> 56:33.179
<i>Right, it is.</i>

56:33.213 --> 56:34.815
<i>But for me,
what's really fantastic</i>

56:34.847 --> 56:36.550
<i>is my dream came true.</i>

56:36.583 --> 56:38.085
<i>Betty Boop bought me
this kimono.</i>

56:38.117 --> 56:39.586
<i>I didn't even...
even ask for it.</i>

56:39.619 --> 56:41.288
<i>Somehow, she knew
I love kimonos.</i>

56:41.322 --> 56:43.624
<i>I haven't worn a kimono
in like 15 years.</i>

56:43.657 --> 56:46.760
<i>So look at you boys,
I mean, you're cyber Cupids.</i>

56:46.793 --> 56:49.029
<i>I mean, that is so neat.
Betty and...</i>

56:49.063 --> 56:50.298
<i>ah, Betty.</i>

56:50.331 --> 56:52.033
<i>Don't...</i>

56:52.065 --> 56:54.668
- Mr. Woods, um... okay. Yeah.
- <i>Betty, not now.</i>

56:54.702 --> 56:55.636
- <i>I'm...</i>
- Go ahead.

56:55.668 --> 56:57.003
Take all the time you need.

56:57.036 --> 56:59.606
<i>I'm talking to my future
partners, Betty.</i>

57:02.309 --> 57:04.278
It's um... um...

57:07.780 --> 57:10.918
It's, ah, Mr. Woods,
as I was saying, um,

57:10.951 --> 57:14.922
there are a lot of
different languages in Asia

57:14.954 --> 57:17.991
and based on
my recent experience,

57:18.025 --> 57:20.760
I think it's important that
there be a language quotient

57:20.793 --> 57:24.699
- on the next variable.
- <i>Oh no, I... bad action.</i>

57:25.733 --> 57:26.801
<i>What the hell, True?</i>

57:26.833 --> 57:28.301
I didn't prove
the app works, Benny.

57:28.335 --> 57:30.338
I only proved it doesn't work.

57:30.371 --> 57:32.907
<i>Just get your ass back here
and let's finish this deal.</i>

57:32.940 --> 57:34.141
One more day?

57:34.173 --> 57:35.376
<i>Where's Kiki?
I'll make him bring you back.</i>

57:35.409 --> 57:36.911
I need one more day.

57:36.943 --> 57:37.945
<i>Dammit, True.</i>

57:40.047 --> 57:43.150
<i>You know what? Fine.</i>

57:43.182 --> 57:44.652
<i>The biggest moment of your life,</i>

57:44.684 --> 57:46.253
<i>and you're going to
leave me alone.</i>

57:46.286 --> 57:47.788
You're being dramatic.

57:47.820 --> 57:49.255
<i>You want dramatic?</i>

57:49.289 --> 57:50.191
<i>How's this?</i>

57:51.358 --> 57:52.293
Ah-ah.

58:22.389 --> 58:23.758
<i>Sí, ¿quien es?</i>

58:23.791 --> 58:24.692
<i>True.</i>

58:28.128 --> 58:29.963
I need
your help, please.

58:29.996 --> 58:31.699
At nine at night?

58:31.731 --> 58:32.666
I know,

58:32.699 --> 58:34.301
but I keep playing tonight
over in my head.

58:36.170 --> 58:37.204
All right, come in.

58:37.237 --> 58:38.372
But you have to be quiet

58:38.405 --> 58:40.207
because Amalia and my mom
are asleep.

58:40.239 --> 58:41.174
Got it.

58:44.010 --> 58:45.913
Looks like someone's hungry.

58:45.945 --> 58:47.081
Oh, I'm working on
some appetizers

58:47.114 --> 58:49.050
for the scholarship cook-off.

58:49.083 --> 58:50.718
You know what?

58:50.751 --> 58:53.254
You'll be my sous chef
while you sulk.

58:58.726 --> 59:00.260
Don't ask.

59:00.293 --> 59:02.262
It's my mother's
weight loss plan.

59:02.295 --> 59:03.297
Don't I look hot?

59:04.797 --> 59:05.766
In fact...

59:07.900 --> 59:10.904
Oh, that's
a lovely question.

59:10.938 --> 59:14.240
If I win the Miss
Valle de Guadalupe pageant,

59:14.273 --> 59:16.409
I'll find homes for
all the street dogs.

59:16.443 --> 59:19.747
I'll erect street signs
so no one gets lost.

59:19.780 --> 59:21.015
And I'll solve
world hunger

59:21.047 --> 59:22.716
with Karina's amazing cooking.

59:23.851 --> 59:24.785
- Shh.
- Oh, oops.

59:24.818 --> 59:26.320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:26.353 --> 59:27.855
- Knock it off.
- Sorry.

59:27.887 --> 59:29.190
And start
beating those eggs.

59:29.222 --> 59:30.958
Okay.

59:30.990 --> 59:32.259
Bad eggs. Bad eggs.

59:32.291 --> 59:34.060
Bad eggs. Bad eggs.

59:34.094 --> 59:34.994
- True!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

59:35.028 --> 59:36.431
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:38.931 --> 59:42.802
Oh um, if you go
a little faster like this,

59:42.835 --> 59:43.937
it'll make them
a little fluffier.

59:43.971 --> 59:44.905
Got it.

59:49.009 --> 59:50.478
Ah, wait,
why did you come here?

59:50.510 --> 59:52.512
I screwed up.

59:52.545 --> 59:53.748
She's impetuous like that.

59:53.780 --> 59:56.083
She likes
daring type of guys.

59:57.483 --> 59:58.518
Daring?

59:58.552 --> 01:00:00.054
She wants to
see the world.

01:00:00.086 --> 01:00:02.456
Bungee jump off bridges,
that kind of crap.

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:05.157
Around here?

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:06.861
That's how she met you.

01:00:06.893 --> 01:00:10.163
Regina had no idea that she was
gone partying in San Diego.

01:00:10.197 --> 01:00:11.099
Could you rinse these?

01:00:15.536 --> 01:00:16.804
- Hey, True?
- Yeah?

01:00:16.836 --> 01:00:17.972
Of all the apps

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:19.306
you could have created...

01:00:19.338 --> 01:00:21.241
...why a dating app?

01:00:22.943 --> 01:00:26.914
Well, after my father
left my mother,

01:00:28.148 --> 01:00:29.150
she always said
there was the perfect match

01:00:29.182 --> 01:00:30.351
for her out there
somewhere.

01:00:32.485 --> 01:00:33.520
Just never
seemed to find it.

01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:37.458
Your poor mom.

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:41.261
I figured I-I wouldn't
leave it to chance,

01:00:41.295 --> 01:00:43.463
so I decided I'd create

01:00:43.496 --> 01:00:45.365
the perfect mathematical
formula for love.

01:00:47.233 --> 01:00:50.403
You think math
can help you find love?

01:00:50.436 --> 01:00:54.507
Of course. I mean,
if you weigh in value,

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:58.077
mutual likes and dislikes,
add proximity detectors

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:01.181
and process it all
using the latest targeted

01:01:01.215 --> 01:01:05.352
advertising algorithms,
you get "Compatible".

01:01:05.385 --> 01:01:06.453
Boop.

01:01:06.485 --> 01:01:08.855
How unromantic. Boop.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:13.227
What are you doing?

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.328
I'm creating your profile.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.295
Humor me.

01:01:16.362 --> 01:01:18.298
Karina?

01:01:18.331 --> 01:01:19.465
- Salas.
- Salas.

01:01:19.498 --> 01:01:21.034
That's... that's right.

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:22.603
Now a quote.

01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:29.210
"The flavor of life is made
with love, sweat and tears."

01:01:29.242 --> 01:01:30.244
Ah, so silly.

01:01:32.346 --> 01:01:34.581
I'm an aspiring chef.

01:01:34.614 --> 01:01:39.286
My friends would say
I'm loving, patient, funny.

01:01:40.987 --> 01:01:42.889
I'm a great Spanish tutor...

01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:45.593
and I love my family.

01:01:47.427 --> 01:01:50.498
Looking for someone
ready to adore me.

01:01:55.369 --> 01:01:56.604
- Oh!
- I'm an idiot.

01:01:56.637 --> 01:01:57.939
- Shoot.
- Ah.

01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:10.384
Ah.

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:11.317
Ah. I-I shouldn't
be doing this.

01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:12.452
I'm-I'm sorry. I-I...

01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:15.388
Look, True,
I um, I'm married.

01:02:15.422 --> 01:02:16.490
What?

01:02:16.523 --> 01:02:18.125
He's not here.

01:02:18.157 --> 01:02:19.926
He left to the States
to help us out financially.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.528
It was supposed to be a year.
It's been three.

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:27.166
- Ah!
- You should go.

01:02:27.199 --> 01:02:28.101
- Ah!
- You have to go.

01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:29.169
You should...

01:02:29.202 --> 01:02:30.471
Yeah. Yeah. Ah!

01:03:02.635 --> 01:03:05.273
Thanks for meeting me
and not ignoring my text.

01:03:06.505 --> 01:03:07.974
Um...

01:03:15.132 --> 01:03:18.951
Like this?

01:03:18.985 --> 01:03:20.019
Where's the library?

01:03:26.259 --> 01:03:27.461
<i>I understand everything you say.</i>

01:03:27.494 --> 01:03:29.396
- <i>¿Que es?</i>
- <i>What is this?</i>

01:03:29.429 --> 01:03:31.030
It's called a pilot.

01:03:31.063 --> 01:03:32.432
Kiki got it from
this girl named Aureli.

01:03:35.469 --> 01:03:40.007
Look, um, I'm sorry
I pretended like I knew Spanish

01:03:40.039 --> 01:03:43.476
and for taking my clothes off,
and for pretty much everything.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.112
This is me.

01:03:45.144 --> 01:03:48.248
I-I like plain beef tacos
and-and gluten free beer.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.416
I'm not an adventurous guy,

01:03:49.449 --> 01:03:52.485
and-and I'm not really
a wine guy either.

01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:56.990
I'm pretty simple,
but I do know I like you,

01:03:57.023 --> 01:03:59.192
and it... the app matched us
for a reason.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:01.362
And-and if you just have
some tacos with me

01:04:01.394 --> 01:04:03.063
and-and a beer,

01:04:03.096 --> 01:04:05.431
ah, I think you'll find
that I'm a pretty cool guy.

01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:11.070
<i>You know what?</i>

01:04:11.103 --> 01:04:13.106
<i>Daniel
always does what Daniel wants.</i>

01:04:16.376 --> 01:04:18.078
<i>And here
you are doing this for me.</i>

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:20.114
<i>It's like my mom says...</i>

01:04:22.215 --> 01:04:23.417
<i>...one nail removes another.</i>

01:04:23.449 --> 01:04:25.385
Yeah. I have no idea
what that means.

01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:31.792
<i>That's what I love about you.</i>

01:04:33.193 --> 01:04:34.228
<i>You make me laugh.</i>

01:04:37.797 --> 01:04:38.664
<i>This can't be.</i>

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.414
Ah.

01:04:58.085 --> 01:04:59.086
Ah.

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:07.628
Angelica, who's he?

01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:09.763
- Daniel.
- <i>Daniel.</i>

01:05:09.795 --> 01:05:11.230
Daniel?

01:05:11.264 --> 01:05:13.800
<i>Dos meses sin ver
tus lindos ojos...</i>

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.101
<i>Two months
without your beautiful eyes.</i>

01:05:15.135 --> 01:05:17.204
<i>...y mi alma revive con
una sola mirada.</i>

01:05:17.237 --> 01:05:18.505
<i>And my soul
revives with just one glance.</i>

01:05:18.538 --> 01:05:20.574
Ah, hmm-mm. Daniel,.

01:05:20.606 --> 01:05:21.474
<i>Daniel, what are you doing here?</i>

01:05:22.608 --> 01:05:23.143
<i>I couldn't stand a second more.</i>

01:05:24.143 --> 01:05:25.545
<i>I traveled three days.</i>

01:05:26.514 --> 01:05:27.715
<i>I had to see you.</i>

01:05:27.748 --> 01:05:31.418
Ah, <i>hola.</i> So I'm,
so I'm so sorry... so I'm... s...

01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:33.454
<i>Soy</i> True. I'm True so...

01:05:33.487 --> 01:05:37.124
Daniel.

01:05:37.157 --> 01:05:38.459
<i>Daniel, remember the friend</i>

01:05:38.492 --> 01:05:39.827
<i>I told you about, True?</i>

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.861
<i>Hey.</i>

01:05:40.894 --> 01:05:42.396
- No. Daniel.
- <i>No. Daniel.</i>

01:05:43.563 --> 01:05:44.765
<i>Don't hit him.</i>

01:05:44.797 --> 01:05:46.199
I'm not going to hit you.

01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:48.768
<i>I'm not going to hit him.</i>

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:51.572
<i>I'm changing my way.</i>

01:05:51.605 --> 01:05:52.472
Hmm-mm.

01:05:52.505 --> 01:05:53.739
<i>All of a sudden.</i>

01:05:53.773 --> 01:05:54.775
Nice to meet you, True.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:59.245
Any friend of Angelica
is a friend of mine.

01:05:59.278 --> 01:06:00.547
It's a pleasure
to meet you too.

01:06:01.547 --> 01:06:04.350
It's a pretty kick-ass bike
you got there.

01:06:05.385 --> 01:06:06.219
Thanks,
I restored it myself.

01:06:06.253 --> 01:06:07.688
- It's awesome.
- You know how to ride?

01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:12.259
Huh?
Sure, yeah. Totally.

01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:14.193
- All right.
- You never forget.

01:06:18.664 --> 01:06:20.266
<i>You're so annoying.</i>

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.235
Hey.

01:06:25.838 --> 01:06:27.474
Is it... is it... is it on?
Is it...

01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:29.543
<i>You got to pump it?</i>

01:06:29.576 --> 01:06:31.878
You got to
turn on the key first.

01:06:31.911 --> 01:06:35.348
Oh. Ah, got it.

01:06:36.282 --> 01:06:37.518
Cool.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:39.219
I knew that, by the way.

01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:42.389
I knew that... I knew you...
where that was... ready?

01:06:42.422 --> 01:06:44.324
- Here I go.
- Rev it up.

01:06:44.356 --> 01:06:45.458
I don't know, man.

01:06:45.492 --> 01:06:49.596
All right, here we go.
One, two, three.

01:06:49.628 --> 01:06:53.299
Woah, woah, woah, woah, wah!

01:06:56.503 --> 01:06:58.205
Oh my...

01:06:58.237 --> 01:06:59.172
True!

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:06.379
True!

01:07:08.715 --> 01:07:10.417
- True!
- I'm so sorry.

01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:11.792
Are you ok?

01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:14.150
Calm down, Daniel!

01:07:14.184 --> 01:07:15.189
No, no,
I'll fix everything.

01:07:15.222 --> 01:07:15.942
<i>Tranquilo.</i>

01:07:15.976 --> 01:07:19.225
My love look, I want to punch
him in the face, but nothing!

01:07:19.259 --> 01:07:20.494
<i>I will fix everything.
I am so sorry.</i>

01:07:20.527 --> 01:07:21.628
- No, no, no.
- I know you restored it...

01:07:21.661 --> 01:07:22.663
but I will...
I will-you-the... this is...

01:07:22.695 --> 01:07:23.797
Don't worry about it.

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:24.831
I'll take care of...

01:07:31.403 --> 01:07:32.972
Kiki, we're leaving
back to San Diego.

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:34.974
We're heading back
in 15 minutes.

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:37.476
Why are you leaving?

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:38.445
Hey.

01:07:39.878 --> 01:07:42.415
Staying was a mistake.

01:07:42.449 --> 01:07:44.518
I just can't stop
thinking about the way

01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.552
she looked at him.
I can't get it out of my mind.

01:07:46.585 --> 01:07:48.354
At who?

01:07:48.387 --> 01:07:49.655
Daniel.

01:07:49.688 --> 01:07:51.391
He's here?

01:07:51.423 --> 01:07:53.460
He rode in
on his motorcycle,

01:07:53.492 --> 01:07:56.230
looking all <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>
with his muscles and his hair

01:07:56.262 --> 01:07:59.232
and she just completely melted.

01:07:59.266 --> 01:08:00.500
Man, I just... I don't
know what it is,

01:08:00.532 --> 01:08:02.868
but that guy has
such a hold on her.

01:08:02.902 --> 01:08:06.340
I made a fool of myself.
I just... I fell apart.

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:08.875
Apparently, I get flustered
in front of beautiful men too.

01:08:08.907 --> 01:08:10.344
Don't worry about him.

01:08:10.376 --> 01:08:13.512
Daniel <i>es un bruto;</i>
you're funny.

01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:14.748
You listen to women,

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.751
and you're willing
to take a chance on love.

01:08:17.783 --> 01:08:18.884
Benny was right.

01:08:18.917 --> 01:08:21.654
I came, I saw,
I didn't conquer.

01:08:21.688 --> 01:08:23.390
It's time to go home.

01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:25.692
No, you can't leave now.

01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:29.395
You owe it
to yourself to fight.

01:08:29.429 --> 01:08:30.930
How was it going
before Daniel showed up?

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:35.335
She wanted to give me a chance,

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:38.939
but I blew it when
I crashed his motorcycle.

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.640
You crashed
his motorcycle?

01:08:41.675 --> 01:08:44.743
Yeah.

01:08:44.778 --> 01:08:45.877
That's awesome.

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:51.716
That is not awesome!
He was so mad.

01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:55.453
True, listen.
About last night... I just...

01:08:55.488 --> 01:09:00.359
Oh, so hot in Valle!
Aurelie is so gorgeous.

01:09:00.393 --> 01:09:02.029
All she wants is the Kiki.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.697
We're heading back
to San Diego.

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:04.663
If you can be ready in an hour,

01:09:04.698 --> 01:09:06.667
I'm telling Sabi
to take us to the border.

01:09:06.698 --> 01:09:09.068
What? No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:12.639
No, Aurelie invited us
to a party tonight.

01:09:12.671 --> 01:09:15.707
Bro, I've been here for you
for the last three days.

01:09:15.742 --> 01:09:17.676
The least you could do
is be here for me.

01:09:17.711 --> 01:09:18.743
Kiki, it's time...

01:09:18.778 --> 01:09:20.514
No, no!

01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:23.683
Tonight we dance and you...
get a babysitter.

01:09:23.716 --> 01:09:25.018
You're coming with us.

01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:26.019
Oh, I should probably
rest for the cook off...

01:09:26.051 --> 01:09:29.421
No, pshhh.
No, more Mr. Nice Kiki.

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:31.557
Only Mr. Dancing Kiki.

01:09:50.577 --> 01:09:52.011
- Ugh.
- Wow.

01:09:56.015 --> 01:09:57.017
Are you feeling better?

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.086
Angelica who?

01:10:01.387 --> 01:10:02.722
You know any of these people?

01:10:02.756 --> 01:10:04.490
Many of them.
It's a small community.

01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:07.761
Everyone knows everyone.
They all know about you.

01:10:07.793 --> 01:10:09.462
What? What do they know?

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:10.997
They have bets going on

01:10:11.029 --> 01:10:13.065
whether Angelica's going to
fall for you or not.

01:10:13.099 --> 01:10:14.067
No, they do not.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.702
Yeah.

01:10:16.935 --> 01:10:18.804
They don't know
about Daniel.

01:10:18.837 --> 01:10:21.841
I could make a lot of money
with that useful info.

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:23.109
Hey, I'm hurting here.

01:10:23.143 --> 01:10:24.610
Stop.

01:10:32.786 --> 01:10:36.390
So I um, have news...

01:10:36.422 --> 01:10:39.893
Carlos was deported.
My husband.

01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:42.529
What? No way.

01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:44.096
Yeah, he's being held
at the border,

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.067
and we're not sure
when he'll be released.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.035
Wow.

01:10:52.104 --> 01:10:54.540
He started a new family.

01:10:54.573 --> 01:10:55.509
What?

01:10:57.543 --> 01:10:59.046
He has a little boy
named Carlitos.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:02.708
Son of a useless mother.

01:11:03.983 --> 01:11:06.019
You are scary
when you speak Spanish.

01:11:09.788 --> 01:11:11.123
You know what?

01:11:11.157 --> 01:11:14.795
Forget Angelica,
forget Carlos.

01:11:14.828 --> 01:11:16.062
No more talking.

01:11:16.095 --> 01:11:18.565
Tonight, we dance.

01:11:18.597 --> 01:11:20.766
Okay.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.935
Hey True, Karina!

01:11:21.967 --> 01:11:23.036
Hey, Kiki!

01:11:23.069 --> 01:11:25.038
Hey!

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:27.173
You made it! Hey! Cheers, man.

01:11:27.207 --> 01:11:28.975
- Oh my gosh.
- Hey, look who's here.

01:11:35.481 --> 01:11:37.884
My friend
was a . Yes.

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.953
- Oh no.
- I know.

01:11:39.985 --> 01:11:40.987
Ah. Oh.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.989
Isn't this beautiful?

01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:44.690
It's so peaceful out here.

01:11:47.226 --> 01:11:48.694
My app is stupid.

01:11:48.728 --> 01:11:50.163
No, it's not.

01:11:50.195 --> 01:11:52.198
But don't you think,
in the end,

01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:55.534
it's people's true nature what
really makes the relationship

01:11:55.568 --> 01:11:57.537
either stick or not?

01:11:57.569 --> 01:11:58.871
I hope not,

01:11:58.904 --> 01:12:00.873
because my true nature
is to be a huge dork.

01:12:00.907 --> 01:12:02.742
You know
what pisses me off?

01:12:02.774 --> 01:12:03.844
What?

01:12:03.877 --> 01:12:05.912
It's been over for about a year.

01:12:05.944 --> 01:12:07.179
I haven't been in love
with Carlos,

01:12:07.212 --> 01:12:10.182
but I hung in there
because we made vows.

01:12:10.216 --> 01:12:11.518
Right.

01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:12.919
And because we have Amalia.

01:12:12.952 --> 01:12:14.521
Right. I mean,
you're not the only one

01:12:14.554 --> 01:12:15.521
that's been waiting for him.

01:12:15.555 --> 01:12:16.957
- So is she.
- Exactly.

01:12:16.989 --> 01:12:18.757
He doesn't think that
I've had feelings for others?

01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:19.893
Exactly.

01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:21.194
I have needs too.

01:12:21.226 --> 01:12:23.729
- Of course, you do.
- I'm such a fool.

01:12:23.762 --> 01:12:25.131
Here I am being faithful...

01:12:25.163 --> 01:12:27.000
Idiot.
I mean him, not you.

01:12:27.033 --> 01:12:28.101
...fighting my feelings for you.

01:12:28.134 --> 01:12:30.203
Exactly... wait, what?
What? What?

01:12:32.905 --> 01:12:33.841
I'm such a bad friend...

01:12:36.175 --> 01:12:39.813
But I can't help
what I'm feeling.

01:12:39.845 --> 01:12:41.213
Karina...

01:13:00.567 --> 01:13:03.970
<i>Welcome to our annual
culinary cook-off contest.</i>

01:13:08.073 --> 01:13:11.877
Encuentro Regina Scholarship
was started five years ago.

01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:13.980
Our goal is to develop
the talents

01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:16.783
of our local aspiring chefs

01:13:16.815 --> 01:13:20.019
and send them to study
with the masters of the world.

01:13:20.052 --> 01:13:22.255
Judges, please take your seats
at the table.

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:28.193
Ladies and gentlemen,
our chefs:

01:13:28.226 --> 01:13:31.631
Karina, Carmela, and Ricardo.

01:13:31.663 --> 01:13:33.867
Karina!

01:13:37.904 --> 01:13:40.140
<i>Our chefs have prepared
a three-course meal</i>

01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:41.707
<i>for our judges,</i>

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.145
and they will now present
the appetizers.

01:14:06.032 --> 01:14:09.336
And now, it's time
for the main course.

01:14:16.975 --> 01:14:18.488
- Oh, excuse me.
- Watch it, man.

01:14:18.522 --> 01:14:20.012
Excuse me. S-sorry.

01:14:20.046 --> 01:14:21.615
<i>Bueno.
We will give the judges</i>

01:14:21.648 --> 01:14:24.117
<i>30 minutes to make
their selection.</i>

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:27.853
<i>In the meantime,
continue to enjoy our wine</i>

01:14:27.886 --> 01:14:30.222
<i>and delicacies of our region.</i>

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.668
There you are.

01:14:42.702 --> 01:14:43.770
Did you get this text
from Benny?

01:14:43.802 --> 01:14:45.704
Yeah, that's why I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

01:14:45.738 --> 01:14:47.039
- What's going on?
- I-I don't know.

01:14:47.073 --> 01:14:48.807
Benny's gone off the rails.

01:14:48.841 --> 01:14:49.909
<i>True.</i>

01:14:49.942 --> 01:14:50.909
- Oh, ah... I need a second.
- What?

01:14:50.943 --> 01:14:52.345
- Can you give me one second?
- No, no, no.

01:14:52.377 --> 01:14:53.345
I just... just one second,
please? Thank you.

01:14:53.378 --> 01:14:54.680
Ah, whatever.
I'm going to call him.

01:14:54.713 --> 01:14:56.882
Thanks. Um...

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:59.052
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola.</i> Um...

01:14:59.085 --> 01:15:00.020
Hmm-mm.

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:06.092
I have something to tell you.

01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:10.697
<i>I also
have something to tell you.</i>

01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:13.132
I understand
how you feel for Daniel.

01:15:19.005 --> 01:15:20.673
<i>Daniel
wants me to go back with him</i>

01:15:20.707 --> 01:15:21.908
- <i>to Mexico City.</i>
- I get it.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.409
I-I get it.

01:15:24.377 --> 01:15:26.780
No.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:28.748
<i>No, I don't want to.</i>

01:15:33.219 --> 01:15:35.922
Ah... ah, Karina,
it's-it's not what you think.

01:15:35.954 --> 01:15:36.890
<i>Karina,</i>

01:15:36.922 --> 01:15:38.757
Ah!

01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:39.793
Ah.

01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:42.833
Karina, please.

01:15:42.875 --> 01:15:44.625
Carlos please, I can't do this.

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:46.116
Karina, I'm talking to you!

01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:55.240
<i>You know what?
Your app doesn't work.</i>

01:15:55.274 --> 01:15:57.410
<i>My friends created my profile.</i>

01:15:57.443 --> 01:15:59.846
<i>You and I have nothing
in common, you idiot.</i>

01:16:03.815 --> 01:16:04.842
Karina, please.

01:16:04.876 --> 01:16:07.260
No, Carlos. You're shameless. How dare you show up here?

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.535
- Is everything okay?
- Let go of me, Carlos!

01:16:10.569 --> 01:16:12.991
- Who's this idiot?
- A friend. This is my husband.

01:16:13.024 --> 01:16:14.193
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention...</i>

01:16:15.261 --> 01:16:16.429
<i>Please. Everyone...</i>

01:16:16.462 --> 01:16:19.065
Oh! Oh! Ow.

01:16:19.097 --> 01:16:21.100
<i>...the judges
have made their decision.</i>

01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:22.836
<i>And it is unanimous.</i>

01:16:22.868 --> 01:16:24.002
- Jesus, True.
- Whoa...

01:16:24.036 --> 01:16:25.070
- You okay?
- Uh-uh.

01:16:25.104 --> 01:16:26.506
Hey, get up. Ah.

01:16:26.538 --> 01:16:28.073
Hey, we got to get back
to San Diego now.

01:16:28.106 --> 01:16:29.309
I just got a PDF

01:16:29.341 --> 01:16:30.375
from Benny's lawyer.

01:16:30.408 --> 01:16:31.877
You're Benny's lawyer.

01:16:31.911 --> 01:16:34.114
Not anymore.
He screwed us, man.

01:16:34.146 --> 01:16:36.349
He screwed us hard. Okay?

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.484
Now, he's going forward
with "Compatible" without you.

01:16:38.518 --> 01:16:39.819
Come on, we got to go.

01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:40.787
<i>The winner of this year's</i>

01:16:40.819 --> 01:16:43.956
<i>culinary cook-off contest
scholarship is</i>

01:16:43.989 --> 01:16:45.390
Karina Salas.

01:16:47.894 --> 01:16:49.195
Karina!

01:17:29.268 --> 01:17:30.368
Benny, how could you do this?

01:17:30.403 --> 01:17:32.472
<i>We've been best friends
since the seventh grade.</i>

01:17:32.505 --> 01:17:34.073
Don't talk to my partner.

01:17:34.105 --> 01:17:36.275
Your partner?
Benny's my partner.

01:17:36.309 --> 01:17:38.878
He was your partner.

01:17:38.911 --> 01:17:40.145
I spent my whole career

01:17:40.179 --> 01:17:42.047
making snap judgements
on people's characters.

01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:44.516
And 99.999% of the time,
I'm right.

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.418
The first time I met you,
I didn't like you.

01:17:46.452 --> 01:17:49.055
You had some good ideas,
but you're not a winner.

01:17:49.087 --> 01:17:50.889
You're like
a whiny little wiener.

01:17:50.922 --> 01:17:51.791
It's not true.

01:17:51.823 --> 01:17:53.158
You don't even know
what the truth is.

01:17:53.192 --> 01:17:55.127
You spend your whole time
chasing dreams

01:17:55.161 --> 01:17:56.529
instead of grabbing
onto reality.

01:17:56.561 --> 01:17:58.597
For once in your life,
do the right thing!

01:18:01.033 --> 01:18:03.837
Here is an offer from
Mr. Vaswani and Mr. Woods.

01:18:03.869 --> 01:18:05.971
I think you'll find it
quite fair.

01:18:06.005 --> 01:18:07.440
We're going to proceed
with the three F's.

01:18:07.472 --> 01:18:09.442
Fun, fast, and fair for all.

01:18:11.543 --> 01:18:14.447
I got another
F-word for you, buddy.

01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:16.014
<i>I trusted you.</i>

01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:17.483
"Compatible"
was my idea, Benny.

01:18:17.515 --> 01:18:21.220
True, you can trust me,
but I can't trust you.

01:18:21.253 --> 01:18:22.221
What?

01:18:22.255 --> 01:18:23.856
I would never do something
like this to you.

01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:25.358
<i>Oh, but you did.</i>

01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:26.259
This last week,

01:18:26.292 --> 01:18:29.629
you abandoned our company
for a chick?

01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:32.565
<i>But it's not just about
this last week, man.</i>

01:18:32.597 --> 01:18:35.335
From the beginning,
you've been insecure,

01:18:35.368 --> 01:18:37.403
unable to pull the trigger
on anything,

01:18:37.435 --> 01:18:40.505
and yes, it was your idea,
but without me,

01:18:40.538 --> 01:18:44.509
"Compatible" would simply
be that... an idea.

01:18:44.542 --> 01:18:46.979
<i>I've made this into a reality.</i>

01:18:47.012 --> 01:18:50.250
What we are offering
is more than fair, True.

01:18:50.283 --> 01:18:51.517
Don't say my name.

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:53.887
T-t-t-r-r-r-oo-oo-oo.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.020
Don't say my name.

01:18:55.054 --> 01:18:56.122
- True.
- No.

01:18:56.154 --> 01:18:57.456
- Ta-rue.
- Don't...

01:18:57.489 --> 01:18:58.490
- True!
- Don't say my name!

01:18:58.524 --> 01:19:01.027
Ta-ha-hoa-ruea.

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:02.095
- Don't!
- A-True!

01:19:02.127 --> 01:19:03.128
- Don't!
- True!

01:19:03.162 --> 01:19:05.899
Bless you!
Don't! Don't!

01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:07.900
Choo, choo,
choo, choo, True!

01:19:07.934 --> 01:19:09.435
A choo-choo train? Don't!

01:19:09.467 --> 01:19:10.435
True.

01:19:10.469 --> 01:19:12.639
- Shut up!
- True!

01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:17.376
Okay, gentlemen,
let's just settle down, huh?

01:19:17.409 --> 01:19:20.313
Ah, Mr. Andrews and I
will look over your offer

01:19:20.345 --> 01:19:22.981
<i>and get back to you
with our decision.</i>

01:19:23.015 --> 01:19:26.119
I know my decision.
No! My answer is 'No' now.

01:19:26.152 --> 01:19:27.987
It's 'No' tomorrow.
It'll be 'No' forever!

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.122
That's okay.

01:19:29.154 --> 01:19:30.055
Thank you very much.

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:32.557
Let's go, True.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:33.693
- No!
- Thank you.

01:19:33.725 --> 01:19:35.260
- No!
- Let's go.

01:19:35.293 --> 01:19:36.362
<i>Come on, just watch your step.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

01:19:36.395 --> 01:19:37.931
<i>You can suck my app!</i>

01:19:39.431 --> 01:19:40.500
Can you believe that guy?

01:19:40.533 --> 01:19:42.168
I actually can't.

01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:44.404
Oh, oh, okay.
This is extreme.

01:19:44.436 --> 01:19:46.639
I'm not signing
those papers, Kiki.

01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:49.274
Son of... he pulled
a Zuckerberg on us.

01:19:49.307 --> 01:19:52.412
But-but-but Benny did
give you two options.

01:19:52.444 --> 01:19:54.246
A, they could buy you out,

01:19:54.279 --> 01:19:57.015
or B, you could be
a silent partner

01:19:57.048 --> 01:19:58.484
with no voting rights.

01:19:58.516 --> 01:20:00.118
I don't care if they offer me
three times that amount.

01:20:00.152 --> 01:20:02.956
I'm not selling
or giving up what's mine.

01:20:02.988 --> 01:20:04.156
How can he do this to me?

01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:05.958
Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:05.992 --> 01:20:08.427
You don't have to accept
his terms. All right?

01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:12.131
Ah, you definitely won't get
the deal from Maximillion,

01:20:12.163 --> 01:20:14.634
but we can find
another investor.

01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.170
Without me,
"Compatible" will die.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.742
Hello?

01:20:22.774 --> 01:20:24.109
<i>Hola,</i> Sabi.

01:20:26.278 --> 01:20:27.213
Oh, no.

01:20:30.015 --> 01:20:32.617
Thank you
for letting me know.

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:33.586
<i>Adios.</i>

01:20:36.055 --> 01:20:37.690
Everything okay?

01:20:37.722 --> 01:20:41.226
No. Regina died.

01:21:26.271 --> 01:21:30.510
It was a beautiful funeral.

01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:31.610
I bet the whole town was here.

01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:42.288
I should've told her
that I loved her.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.457
She knew.
I mean, we all did.

01:21:47.626 --> 01:21:49.529
What am I
going to do without her?

01:21:52.097 --> 01:21:53.432
She was my best friend.

01:21:56.167 --> 01:21:57.569
First Benny,
now Regina.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.476
Benny died?

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:07.480
Oh, no, no.
I-I... he-he screwed me.

01:22:07.512 --> 01:22:09.181
He doesn't want to be
my business partner.

01:22:16.588 --> 01:22:22.494
I spent so many years talking
about business with Regina,

01:22:22.528 --> 01:22:24.731
I was never able to tell her
what I felt.

01:22:27.332 --> 01:22:28.500
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:33.605
You want me to tell Benny
I love him?

01:22:39.177 --> 01:22:42.481
The more I teach you,
the dumber I get.

01:22:48.854 --> 01:22:53.159
So, what happens with
Encuentro Regina now?

01:22:56.494 --> 01:22:57.663
We're about to find out.

01:23:19.251 --> 01:23:20.854
Kiki, what are you doing?

01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:25.557
Thank you all for coming.

01:23:25.591 --> 01:23:27.593
<i>My name is Enrique Calderon,</i>

01:23:27.626 --> 01:23:29.427
<i>and for those of you
who don't know me,</i>

01:23:29.461 --> 01:23:31.463
<i>I'm an attorney.</i>

01:23:31.497 --> 01:23:34.800
Two weeks ago, Regina
asked me to make some changes

01:23:34.832 --> 01:23:36.434
to her last will and testament.

01:23:37.469 --> 01:23:39.939
<i>Now these documents
are drafted in English</i>

01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:43.208
and I've asked Sabi
to translate to Spanish

01:23:43.242 --> 01:23:44.744
for those of us
who are in need of it.

01:23:49.881 --> 01:23:54.286
I, Regina Aragon,
being of sound mind and body,

01:23:54.319 --> 01:23:58.356
leave the following
as my final will and testament.

01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:01.661
Encuentro Regina has been
more than a business.

01:24:01.694 --> 01:24:03.629
It was created out of love.

01:24:03.662 --> 01:24:05.498
We shared this love

01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:08.301
with visitors from
all around the world.

01:24:10.903 --> 01:24:13.338
I tried to prepare
somebody to take over

01:24:13.372 --> 01:24:15.675
when I would no longer be here,

01:24:15.707 --> 01:24:19.711
but found not one person
qualified to run the business.

01:24:21.447 --> 01:24:23.315
<i>Qué!</i>

01:24:23.349 --> 01:24:25.650
<i>I am not leaving
Encuentro to any one of you.</i>

01:24:25.684 --> 01:24:26.953
Wow.

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.923
I am leaving it to ALL of you

01:24:31.957 --> 01:24:36.229
to own, manage,
and grow together.

01:24:36.261 --> 01:24:40.966
The vineyard, hotel, restaurant,
and all properties and assets

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.436
will be owned in common
by all employees.

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:48.274
Wow.

01:24:48.306 --> 01:24:50.909
<i>To my niece,
Angelica Beltran,</i>

01:24:50.943 --> 01:24:53.846
<i>I leave 20% of the business</i>

01:24:53.878 --> 01:24:56.782
<i>as long as she stays
to work and manage it</i>

01:24:56.814 --> 01:25:00.352
<i>for a period of
not less than five years.</i>

01:25:02.287 --> 01:25:03.488
<i>To Sabio Segovia,</i>

01:25:05.323 --> 01:25:07.559
<i>I leave 10% of the business</i>

01:25:07.592 --> 01:25:11.930
<i>in honor of his years of
loyal and dedicated service.</i>

01:25:11.963 --> 01:25:14.966
<i>The remainder of the business
is to be shared equally</i>

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.403
among all salaried employees,

01:25:17.435 --> 01:25:22.340
currently under staff,
with Encuentro Regina.

01:25:22.373 --> 01:25:26.545
With all of my love
and gratitude, Regina Aragon.

01:25:36.755 --> 01:25:37.890
Hey.

01:25:37.922 --> 01:25:40.292
That was a surprise!

01:25:40.326 --> 01:25:43.462
Yeah. Um, sorry
I couldn't tell you sooner.

01:25:43.494 --> 01:25:45.363
Ah, Regina wanted
to keep it a secret

01:25:45.396 --> 01:25:48.734
until after she passed.

01:25:48.766 --> 01:25:50.970
You mean,
she knew she was dying?

01:25:51.002 --> 01:25:52.938
Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah.
<i>Pobrecita.</i>

01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:55.440
She didn't know if it was
three days or three months,

01:25:55.474 --> 01:25:57.943
but she knew
it was terminal.

01:25:57.975 --> 01:26:00.478
So, you two never...?

01:26:00.511 --> 01:26:02.380
Ah, no. Hell no.

01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:06.085
I let your twisted little brain
jump to its own conclusion.

01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:07.520
You're a sly dog, Kiki.

01:26:07.552 --> 01:26:10.088
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:10.122 --> 01:26:14.560
Well, I'm glad things
all worked out in the end.

01:26:14.592 --> 01:26:15.860
Well, I hope so.

01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:19.431
I mean, they have their work
cut out for them.

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:20.966
What do you mean?

01:26:20.998 --> 01:26:23.368
The winery is heavily in debt.

01:26:23.402 --> 01:26:25.805
Regina had a major
US-based distributor pull out

01:26:25.837 --> 01:26:28.106
after the political situation
changed.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.376
I mean, it's not going to be
easy for them

01:26:30.408 --> 01:26:33.045
to keep this place, you know?

01:26:33.078 --> 01:26:34.414
I'm sure they'll pull it off.

01:26:39.451 --> 01:26:41.354
Excuse me, buddy.
I got to talk to someone.

01:26:41.386 --> 01:26:42.521
Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead.

01:26:44.055 --> 01:26:46.791
Sabi, can I have a moment?

01:26:46.824 --> 01:26:48.793
<i>Sí.</i>

01:26:48.827 --> 01:26:52.131
Um, do you know
where Karina went?

01:26:52.163 --> 01:26:53.332
She left in a hurry.

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.570
I messed up.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:27:00.105
As long as there is
breath left in you...

01:27:00.139 --> 01:27:04.076
and breath in her,
there's still a chance.

01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:06.045
Why don't you stay,
fix things with her?

01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:18.090
A wise man once told me...
when love is ready, I'd know.

01:27:35.474 --> 01:27:38.077
Can I talk to her
for a moment?

01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:39.112
Yeah, sure.

01:27:50.756 --> 01:27:51.724
Hmm.

01:28:00.466 --> 01:28:02.067
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

01:28:04.235 --> 01:28:07.773
Ah!

01:28:07.805 --> 01:28:09.007
<i>You didn't waste my time.</i>

01:28:11.643 --> 01:28:14.613
I just wanted a beautiful
and smart girl to love.

01:28:16.081 --> 01:28:17.817
That would love me back.

01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:21.921
True...

01:28:21.953 --> 01:28:23.521
<i>True, you do have</i>

01:28:23.555 --> 01:28:24.789
<i>a beautiful woman who loves you.</i>

01:28:24.823 --> 01:28:25.758
<i>Go to her.</i>

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.563
I have to do something first.

01:28:51.716 --> 01:28:52.818
Hmm.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:12.637
I'd know that cheap watch
anywhere.

01:29:12.671 --> 01:29:14.807
3:30 on the dot.
It's been said before

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.574
that you can set a clock
by your bowel movement.

01:29:16.608 --> 01:29:18.043
It's over, True.

01:29:18.076 --> 01:29:21.212
Just sign the papers and let me
take my dump in peace.

01:29:21.246 --> 01:29:22.715
<i>This isn't the time
or place for this.</i>

01:29:22.747 --> 01:29:23.882
Oh, I think
this is the perfect place

01:29:23.916 --> 01:29:25.650
for a piece of crap like you.

01:29:25.684 --> 01:29:26.851
So it's like that now?

01:29:26.885 --> 01:29:29.021
See, I just had
a little chat with Betty.

01:29:29.054 --> 01:29:30.189
The cleaning lady?

01:29:30.221 --> 01:29:31.689
And I just slipped her
a hundred dollars

01:29:31.722 --> 01:29:33.893
to take every bit of paper
out of this bathroom.

01:29:39.898 --> 01:29:41.800
Good luck wiping
with the air blower.

01:29:41.832 --> 01:29:43.101
That's not funny, True.

01:29:44.168 --> 01:29:45.871
True?

01:29:45.904 --> 01:29:48.774
<i>True! Come back here.</i>

01:29:51.342 --> 01:29:52.545
<i>Spare a square!</i>

01:29:55.948 --> 01:29:58.017
I'm cutting you off financially.

01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:01.753
I don't care, Mom.
I... oh, I'll call you back.

01:30:01.787 --> 01:30:04.123
Hi, hi, hi... Hi Betty.

01:30:08.193 --> 01:30:09.929
Hi, Maxi.

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:21.073
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:30:21.105 --> 01:30:22.942
Hmm. You're so hot. Oh.

01:30:22.975 --> 01:30:24.710
Yeah.

01:30:24.743 --> 01:30:27.179
- Oh. Ah.
- Ah-ah.

01:30:27.212 --> 01:30:29.648
Sometimes you do things
that seem wrong...

01:30:30.782 --> 01:30:32.217
...because it's
the right thing to do.

01:30:33.885 --> 01:30:36.855
Betty, don't leave this here.

01:30:36.887 --> 01:30:38.557
You know I'm a germaphobe.

01:30:42.793 --> 01:30:44.729
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:30:44.762 --> 01:30:46.798
Hey, hey, don't...
don't be mad at Betty, okay?

01:30:46.832 --> 01:30:48.634
Don't be mad at...
and hey, I got...

01:30:48.667 --> 01:30:51.270
I got hand sanitizer,
all right? No big deal.

01:30:54.038 --> 01:30:56.108
<i>Look, I'm here
for a second chance.</i>

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:59.711
I've been in Valle de Guadalupe
with a truly incredible woman

01:30:59.744 --> 01:31:01.913
and I blew it.

01:31:01.947 --> 01:31:05.016
Shocker! That's your plea
for a second chance?

01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:07.820
"Compatible"
matched me with her.

01:31:07.853 --> 01:31:10.788
<i>But a machine isn't enough.</i>

01:31:10.822 --> 01:31:13.092
Love doesn't work that way.

01:31:13.125 --> 01:31:14.627
But if it wasn't for
"Compatible",

01:31:14.659 --> 01:31:15.961
I never would have
went down to Mexico.

01:31:15.993 --> 01:31:16.994
I never would have
made a fool of myself

01:31:17.029 --> 01:31:18.998
and I never would have met
the most incredible,

01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:21.199
hardworking woman
in the world.

01:31:21.233 --> 01:31:23.636
Are you here to brag, son?

01:31:24.903 --> 01:31:26.072
No.

01:31:34.912 --> 01:31:36.247
"Compatible" said
your favorite's Tempranillo.

01:31:40.152 --> 01:31:42.054
And that's a copy
of all the emails Benny sent

01:31:42.087 --> 01:31:43.222
<i>backstabbing me.</i>

01:31:43.255 --> 01:31:44.323
<i>If he can turn on
someone he's known</i>

01:31:44.355 --> 01:31:45.390
since the seventh grade,

01:31:45.423 --> 01:31:47.092
what's he going to do
with someone he just met?

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.329
What is this?

01:31:51.363 --> 01:31:54.200
I signed.
I'm taking your deal.

01:31:57.368 --> 01:32:02.974
Ah! I guess you're...

01:32:03.007 --> 01:32:06.010
not the wiener
I thought you were.

01:32:06.043 --> 01:32:07.012
Good luck.

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.823
Last year, we had a heat
wave that dried the grapes,

01:32:18.856 --> 01:32:22.994
but this year,
it's been plentiful.

01:32:25.096 --> 01:32:27.865
It's the most beautiful
place in Valle de Guadalupe.

01:32:27.899 --> 01:32:30.469
- True, how are you?
- Good.

01:32:30.502 --> 01:32:32.237
<i>Mr. Mendez,
this is True Andrews,</i>

01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:34.073
<i>he's a friend of the family.</i>

01:32:34.105 --> 01:32:36.307
True, this is
Mr. Marco Mendez.

01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:40.713
He's um... he's buying
Encuentro Regina.

01:32:40.746 --> 01:32:43.114
We'll simply call it
Encuentro, of course.

01:32:43.148 --> 01:32:45.851
We're not
changing the name.

01:32:45.884 --> 01:32:47.485
<i>True, what are you
talking about?</i>

01:32:47.519 --> 01:32:48.954
Mr. Mendez is buying
the vineyard.

01:32:48.987 --> 01:32:51.023
He can call it
what he wants.

01:32:51.055 --> 01:32:53.257
Sorry.
Can I have a moment?

01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:55.061
<i>Excuse us.</i>

01:33:04.336 --> 01:33:05.503
What is this?

01:33:05.537 --> 01:33:07.173
You said you needed
an investor.

01:33:10.007 --> 01:33:13.045
True, I can't accept this.

01:33:13.078 --> 01:33:14.880
You worked so hard
on your app.

01:33:14.912 --> 01:33:15.913
<i>I'll create a new app,</i>

01:33:15.947 --> 01:33:18.484
or I won't.
Besides, it's done.

01:33:18.516 --> 01:33:20.786
Ah.

01:33:20.819 --> 01:33:22.855
<i>Ah, I get it.</i>

01:33:22.887 --> 01:33:26.024
You don't want to be
my partner either.

01:33:26.056 --> 01:33:30.094
I may be old,
but I'm not a <i>pendejo.</i>

01:33:30.127 --> 01:33:34.265
I'm sorry, Mr. Mendez, but
the vineyard is already sold.

01:33:34.298 --> 01:33:36.135
I'll explain it
over a bottle of wine.

01:33:37.868 --> 01:33:40.938
Ah, Sabi, I need to
talk to Karina.

01:33:40.971 --> 01:33:43.908
Ah, <i>mijo,</i>
she won the contest.

01:33:43.942 --> 01:33:47.880
She's leaving for Spain today.

01:33:47.912 --> 01:33:50.982
She's catching a bus
to the airport from Ensenada.

01:33:54.418 --> 01:33:55.453
Sorry, big guy.

01:34:00.292 --> 01:34:02.795
Um, do you prefer
red or white?

01:34:40.164 --> 01:34:41.100
<i>¿Todo bien?</i>

01:34:46.872 --> 01:34:48.407
<i>Tengo un flat tiro.</i>

01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.951
Don't ever tell anyone
I was your Spanish tutor.

01:35:00.551 --> 01:35:01.987
I see you've been working out.

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.388
Hmm. I figured
if I wore this,

01:35:03.421 --> 01:35:05.123
you couldn't stay mad at me.

01:35:05.155 --> 01:35:06.925
You're right.

01:35:06.957 --> 01:35:07.992
But I haven't been mad at you.

01:35:08.025 --> 01:35:10.929
I just, I-I was at first,
but I talked to Angelica.

01:35:10.962 --> 01:35:12.898
We're good.

01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:15.867
Okay, great.
And ah, what about Carlos?

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:18.470
He's out of the picture.
We're no longer married.

01:35:18.502 --> 01:35:20.037
So fast?

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:22.106
Have you heard
of a Mexican divorce?

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.342
You guys have
drive-thru weddings,

01:35:23.375 --> 01:35:25.543
we have drive-thru divorces.

01:35:25.577 --> 01:35:28.079
I can't say
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:35:28.113 --> 01:35:30.916
What does True want?

01:35:30.948 --> 01:35:33.217
He wants me to forgive him
and be his girlfriend. Should I?

01:35:33.251 --> 01:35:34.953
No.

01:35:34.985 --> 01:35:37.256
Come on.
Are you serious?

01:35:37.288 --> 01:35:38.322
You have to be kidding.

01:35:38.355 --> 01:35:41.626
Yes, I am.
I am kidding.

01:35:43.962 --> 01:35:45.297
I have to go.

01:35:45.329 --> 01:35:47.466
I'll wait for you.

01:36:03.314 --> 01:36:04.282
<i>Check the app.</i>
