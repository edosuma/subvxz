[Luke gasps]

02:04.286 --> 02:05.704
[both panting]

02:07.915 --> 02:09.083
[metal creaking]

02:16.257 --> 02:18.009
[both grunt]

02:37.987 --> 02:39.822
[both moaning]

02:46.245 --> 02:47.872
[panting]

02:47.955 --> 02:49.707
[both sighing]

02:56.172 --> 02:57.256
Let me down.

02:58.049 --> 03:01.177
- Um, Robyn says you're too loud.
- [Jessica sighs]

03:02.428 --> 03:04.763
It's nice to grub out
with a girl who likes to eat.

03:04.846 --> 03:07.349
Well, we had quite a workout.

03:10.102 --> 03:13.397
I've never done it with someone else
who has, you know...

03:15.357 --> 03:16.692
Gifts?

03:16.775 --> 03:19.278
Yes, well, you are very gifted.

03:19.361 --> 03:20.612
Likewise.

03:22.073 --> 03:25.117
So just how unbreakable are you?

03:25.201 --> 03:28.870
On a scale of "I don't know" to...

03:28.955 --> 03:30.664
"I'd rather not find out"?

03:30.747 --> 03:36.045
So if I were to bite your finger

03:36.128 --> 03:39.381
with all of my considerable strength...

03:41.800 --> 03:44.553
Depends on how considerable.

03:45.471 --> 03:48.515
So don't go getting any ideas
about my extremities.

03:49.433 --> 03:50.767
[chuckles]

03:50.851 --> 03:52.769
So what else you do?

03:52.853 --> 03:56.523
- Can you punch through a wall?
- [chuckles softly]

03:56.607 --> 03:58.775
Can you stop a moving car?

03:58.859 --> 04:00.486
A slow-moving car.

04:01.946 --> 04:03.948
Can you fly?

04:04.031 --> 04:06.993
It's more like jumping

04:07.076 --> 04:08.660
and then falling.

04:08.744 --> 04:10.036
[laughs]

04:11.538 --> 04:14.708
Okay, there's you, me...

04:15.876 --> 04:17.836
the big green dude and his crew.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.589
You think there's
more of our kind out there?

04:22.841 --> 04:24.385
What?

04:24.468 --> 04:25.844
Nothing.

04:25.927 --> 04:28.221
- Can I have a coffee?
- [man] You got it.

04:29.515 --> 04:31.183
You know somebody else like us?

04:31.267 --> 04:33.269
No. Not like us.

04:38.024 --> 04:40.609
Well, you're the first I've met.

04:42.861 --> 04:44.155
Were you born this way?

04:44.238 --> 04:46.448
Nope. Accident.

04:46.532 --> 04:47.741
You?

04:48.492 --> 04:49.826
Experiment.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.579
Does anyone else know
about your abilities?

04:52.663 --> 04:55.582
Couple. I'm not hiding,
but I'm not advertising.

04:55.666 --> 04:58.419
People find out, they either come at you
with a noose or their hands out.

04:58.502 --> 05:01.088
I got no use for either.

05:01.172 --> 05:03.174
So what, you just don't use it?

05:04.591 --> 05:06.927
[sighs] I protect myself and what's mine.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.180
But that's it.

05:09.263 --> 05:12.099
Being a hero
just puts a target on your back.

05:13.559 --> 05:15.561
Yeah, been there, done that.

05:16.812 --> 05:17.938
The hero gig?

05:18.022 --> 05:19.941
[sighs] I gave it a shot once.

05:20.024 --> 05:22.484
Tell me there was a costume
and you still got it.

05:24.945 --> 05:26.197
It didn't work out.

05:27.614 --> 05:29.866
You still get points for doing good.

05:32.286 --> 05:34.455
Not near enough to cancel out the bad.

05:35.372 --> 05:39.960
The way I see it,
most people got both going on.

05:40.043 --> 05:42.879
Just depends on which part wins that day.

05:45.716 --> 05:47.259
More?

05:47.343 --> 05:49.220
Nah. I'm full.

05:50.137 --> 05:52.473
I wasn't talking about the food.

06:06.112 --> 06:07.697
[both grunting]

06:08.655 --> 06:10.616
[bed rattling]

06:11.992 --> 06:12.993
[bed frame snaps]

06:14.995 --> 06:16.162
[Jessica grunts]

06:22.043 --> 06:23.336
[pants]

06:26.590 --> 06:27.883
[Jessica breathing deeply]

06:32.179 --> 06:34.390
[Jessica] Don't suppose you have
an extra toothbrush?

06:34.473 --> 06:35.474
[Luke] No.

07:10.842 --> 07:12.469
She died.

07:12.553 --> 07:14.138
Bus crash.

07:22.979 --> 07:24.022
I'm sorry.

07:31.447 --> 07:33.324
I gotta go. I got work.

08:14.615 --> 08:16.992
[radio host] <i>Thanks for calling</i>
<i>New York's number one talk radio.</i>

08:17.075 --> 08:19.202
<i>- Next caller...</i>
- [caller 1] <i>I mean, let's get real.</i>

08:19.286 --> 08:20.954
<i>Are we just supposed to just
let that Shlottman girl</i>

08:21.037 --> 08:23.207
<i>run around the city
shooting anybody she wants?</i>

08:23.290 --> 08:24.291
<i>Give me a break!</i>

08:24.375 --> 08:25.751
[radio host] <i>Westchester, you're on.</i>

08:25.834 --> 08:28.003
[caller 2] <i>Ever since those guys quote,</i>
<i>"saved the city,"</i>

08:28.086 --> 08:30.922
<i>people have been making up stories
about more super folk out there.</i>

08:31.006 --> 08:32.383
<i>Now some kid
is pinning her murder on one?</i>

08:32.466 --> 08:35.302
I'll take the bourbon.
Cheapest one you got.

08:35.385 --> 08:37.679
<i>Have you ever heard of
a more made-up name than Kilgrave?</i>

08:37.763 --> 08:39.681
- [clerk chuckles]
<i>- I mean, come on. Give me a break.</i>

08:39.765 --> 08:41.392
[radio host] <i>Raises a good point.</i>

08:41.475 --> 08:43.434
What, you trying to drive
customers away with that shit?

08:44.520 --> 08:45.729
You don't want to buy here,
don't buy here.

08:45.812 --> 08:46.813
[caller 2] <i>...run around the city,</i>

08:46.897 --> 08:50.401
<i>creating all this nonsense
for the rest of us to deal with?</i>

08:50.484 --> 08:53.904
<i>Look, bottom line, the girl's a murderer,
she needs to pay.</i>

09:10.170 --> 09:12.463
[podcast host] <i>It's not the first time</i>
<i>we've seen a vicious killer</i>

09:12.548 --> 09:15.008
<i>lay the blame for their actions

09:15.091 --> 09:19.388
{an8}<i>Remember, Son of Sam said he was</i>
<i>taking orders from his neighbor's dog.</i>

09:19.471 --> 09:24.142
{an8}<i>We laughed at him, through our tears,</i>
<i>and we should laugh at Hope Shlottman.</i>

09:24.225 --> 09:26.728
{an8}<i>She claims to have been controlled</i>
<i>by someone else.</i>

09:26.812 --> 09:29.356
{an8}<i>But she's just another</i>
<i>weak and damaged person</i>

09:29.440 --> 09:32.901
{an8}<i>hiding behind the timeless excuse that</i>
<i>"the devil made me do it."</i>

09:34.903 --> 09:37.781
[Jessica] <i>But what if the devil</i>

09:43.662 --> 09:48.292
<i>Even if you could prove it,

09:56.049 --> 09:58.134
<i>Could you ever forgive yourself?</i>

10:01.388 --> 10:02.431
[man] Fifty-third!

10:02.514 --> 10:03.890
[door closing]

10:03.974 --> 10:06.602
[Hogarth] Jessica,
you can't just barge in here.

10:06.685 --> 10:08.729
Hope Shlottman is getting crucified
in the media

10:08.812 --> 10:10.439
and you need to get out there
and defend her.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.442
Well, until I have irrefutable proof
that she's not a lunatic,

10:13.525 --> 10:15.611
I will not get involved
with the public debate.

10:15.694 --> 10:18.113
You would if you had any balls.

10:18.196 --> 10:21.867
If you would like to display some courage,
let's talk about your testimony.

10:21.950 --> 10:22.993
My testimony?

10:23.076 --> 10:25.871
About you being
another one of Kilgrave's victims.

10:29.833 --> 10:32.043
- Hope. She told you.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:34.087 --> 10:37.173
[scoffs] You like having something on me,
don't you?

10:37.257 --> 10:40.511
I like winning cases
and your story will help me.

10:41.177 --> 10:44.640
My story will put me
in the same position as Hope.

10:48.268 --> 10:49.436
Incarcerated?

10:51.146 --> 10:54.400
Kilgrave leaves a trail
of broken people behind him.

10:54.483 --> 10:55.817
Get some of them to testify.

10:55.901 --> 10:58.153
You get them,
I will use them.

10:58.236 --> 11:00.656
I am busy trying to bring Kilgrave in.

11:00.739 --> 11:03.534
Change public perception
and victims will come forward.

11:03.617 --> 11:05.619
If I go public,
I undercut my credibility,

11:05.702 --> 11:08.121
which will hurt
any argument I bring to trial.

11:08.204 --> 11:10.331
Oh, so you're a cheat and a coward.

11:10.416 --> 11:14.420
[sighs] Careful, Jessica,
because I am the only other person

11:14.503 --> 11:17.464
who is trying to save Hope's life.

11:19.049 --> 11:22.135
Your compassion is overwhelming.

11:28.391 --> 11:29.935
[cell phone vibrates]

11:38.652 --> 11:40.028
[chuckles softly]

11:40.111 --> 11:42.155
[sighs] I'm such an asshole.

11:45.909 --> 11:48.036
- [sighs] Hey, are you busy?
- [elevator dings]

11:48.954 --> 11:50.456
<i>Trish Talk</i> is a lifestyle show.

11:50.539 --> 11:52.248
Being in prison is a lifestyle.

11:52.332 --> 11:55.502
I can't just go on the radio and say,
"Mind control is real."

11:55.586 --> 11:57.045
But people trust you.

11:57.128 --> 11:58.964
Yeah, that's because I back up my claims.

11:59.047 --> 12:00.632
You know it's true.

12:00.716 --> 12:02.258
I'll think about it.

12:02.342 --> 12:05.971
And in the meantime,
you're hiding from Kilgrave, right?

12:06.054 --> 12:08.056
No.

12:08.139 --> 12:11.059
If he was coming after me,
he would've done it by now.

12:11.142 --> 12:14.521
I think with me, he's more into torture
and long-term suffering.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.190
[sighs]

12:17.023 --> 12:19.485
- I'll catch you later.
- I knew it.

12:20.235 --> 12:23.154
You said "Let's do lunch."
You hate that saying.

12:23.238 --> 12:25.491
Because it's stupid.
You eat lunch.

12:25.574 --> 12:28.368
It sounds better than,
"Let's do Jessica another favor."

12:28.451 --> 12:30.662
Look, it's not that, all right? I just...

12:30.746 --> 12:32.205
I really need to get some drugs.

12:32.288 --> 12:34.332
Uh, graduating from alcoholism?

12:34.415 --> 12:36.001
They're for Kilgrave.

12:37.252 --> 12:39.588
Surgical anesthesia knocks out his powers.

12:40.881 --> 12:42.674
Okay, that is huge.

12:44.134 --> 12:45.552
How do we get some?

12:45.636 --> 12:50.015
I mean, it doesn't sound like something
your average drug dealer would have.

12:50.098 --> 12:52.433
Sufentanil is only available in hospitals,

12:52.518 --> 12:55.478
so unless you know
any morally compromised doctors...

12:55.562 --> 12:58.189
All the doctors I know
save small villages.

12:58.273 --> 12:59.399
Figured.

12:59.482 --> 13:01.067
I got it handled.

13:01.151 --> 13:03.153
You mean you're gonna steal it.

13:03.236 --> 13:05.030
I prefer "redistribute it."

13:05.113 --> 13:07.032
Come on, Jess, you're better than that.

13:07.115 --> 13:08.491
- Jesus.
- What?

13:08.575 --> 13:10.118
- Jesus Christ, Trish!
- Oh!

13:10.201 --> 13:11.494
It's nothing.

13:11.578 --> 13:13.205
[Jessica] Who's doing that to you?

13:13.288 --> 13:14.372
Is your mom back?

13:14.455 --> 13:16.332
Just calm down, will you?

13:17.543 --> 13:18.794
Okay, is this why you have

13:18.877 --> 13:21.672
the video surveillance
and the steel-reinforced door?

13:21.755 --> 13:26.092
And bulletproof windows, a safe room.
I made some upgrades.

13:26.176 --> 13:29.470
You... What you made is a fortress.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.932
Trish, what are you afraid of?

13:32.015 --> 13:35.936
Not much, anymore. Except clowns.
But that's just common sense.

13:37.353 --> 13:39.064
You turned my room into a gym.

13:40.023 --> 13:41.692
I needed a place to train.

13:41.775 --> 13:44.152
By "training,"
you mean getting beaten purple.

13:44.903 --> 13:46.822
[both grunt]

13:48.907 --> 13:50.826
No one touches me anymore
unless I want them to.

13:50.909 --> 13:52.744
[breathing heavily]

13:52.828 --> 13:55.914
I let you fight my battles for too long.
When you left...

13:55.997 --> 13:57.290
You became a ninja?

13:57.373 --> 13:59.542
Krav Maga. More brutal.

13:59.626 --> 14:02.253
Well, can you back off?
You're scaring me a little.

14:02.337 --> 14:04.047
I'll make sandwiches.

14:19.187 --> 14:20.647
Thanks.

14:24.818 --> 14:26.027
What are you doing here?

14:26.111 --> 14:27.528
I need a doctor.

14:27.613 --> 14:32.326
[inhales deeply]
A somewhat flexible doctor.

14:32.408 --> 14:35.203
- Uh-huh. Did Jeri send you?
- No.

14:35.286 --> 14:36.997
I want Sufentanil.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.164
[Wendy scoffs]

14:38.248 --> 14:40.291
Actually, I need it. Badly.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.002
And I'll do anything for you to get it.

14:42.085 --> 14:43.294
Anything.

14:43.378 --> 14:45.631
Surgical anesthesia?

14:45.714 --> 14:48.842
Um, do I look like the kind of doctor
who would feed an addict's drug habit?

14:48.925 --> 14:51.552
I hoped. Figured I would ask,
maybe get lucky.

14:52.345 --> 14:53.722
Get out.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.556
I know what's going on.

14:55.641 --> 14:58.977
One of New York's sharkiest lawyers
is divorcing you.

14:59.060 --> 15:02.773
Do you think you're gonna get
a penny out of Hogarth?

15:02.856 --> 15:05.025
You could use someone in your corner.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.447
[quietly]
You're making a lot of assumptions.

15:10.530 --> 15:13.491
What assumptions?
That she's a lawyer?

15:13.574 --> 15:16.828
A shark? That she's divorcing you.

15:16.912 --> 15:17.996
Storms blow over.

15:18.079 --> 15:19.497
Lot of wind, lot of rain.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.332
Jeri's smarter than this.

15:21.416 --> 15:25.128
You don't throw away
the life we built together.

15:25.211 --> 15:26.630
She'll see that, eventually.

15:27.463 --> 15:31.968
Maybe if you do me this favor,
she'll be reminded of your good heart.

15:34.846 --> 15:38.141
I have actual patients waiting for me.

15:38.224 --> 15:39.517
You need to go.

15:40.476 --> 15:41.769
[Wendy sighs]

15:41.853 --> 15:44.815
Look, there is someone out there
doing a lot of harm to a lot of people

15:44.898 --> 15:46.983
and as crazy as it sounds,

15:47.067 --> 15:49.485
Sufentanil is my only chance
at stopping him.

15:54.615 --> 15:55.741
[inhales sharply]

16:01.039 --> 16:02.791
I don't have access
to surgical anesthesia,

16:02.874 --> 16:06.336
so here is a prescription
for an anti-psychotic.

16:07.838 --> 16:09.630
It's for you.

16:09.715 --> 16:10.799
[scoffs]

16:11.842 --> 16:13.844
Just in case.

16:19.766 --> 16:21.268
[indistinct conversations]

16:30.777 --> 16:33.405
[Jessica] <i>Knocking out one clerk</i>
<i>to catch Kilgrave?</i>

16:33.488 --> 16:34.781
<i>Worth it.</i>

16:37.951 --> 16:40.245
<i>Knocking out two people?</i>

16:40.912 --> 16:42.413
<i>Still the right call.</i>

16:44.499 --> 16:45.876
<i>Three people...</i>

16:47.418 --> 16:50.421
<i>or four, depending on
when she's due?</i>

16:51.422 --> 16:52.798
[indistinct radio chatter]

17:15.613 --> 17:16.739
- [bike tires squealing]
- [crashing]

17:16.823 --> 17:18.700
- [man grunting]
- [Malcom] Oh.

17:18.784 --> 17:20.617
- Hey!
- I'm sorry, man. I...

17:20.701 --> 17:22.619
- Hey, <i>Requiem for a Dream...</i>
- [Malcom grunts]

17:22.703 --> 17:23.954
...watch where the hell you're going!

17:24.039 --> 17:27.041
[stammering] Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't... I didn't see you.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.419
- No, no, no. Come back here.
- [Malcolm grunts]

17:29.502 --> 17:33.548
You know what? I'm on this bike every day
because I care about the planet.

17:33.631 --> 17:36.885
And you're too busy self-medicating
to even turn your moronic head.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.095
- [Jessica] Hey!
- [cyclist grunts]

17:39.179 --> 17:42.057
We get it,
you're a real gift to humanity.

17:44.017 --> 17:45.393
Pilates.

17:45.476 --> 17:47.103
Get back to saving the planet.

17:48.939 --> 17:50.774
You're a good person, Jessica Jones.

17:50.857 --> 17:52.067
[scoffs]

17:52.150 --> 17:53.484
You're high.

17:57.864 --> 17:59.074
[knocking on door]

18:03.829 --> 18:04.955
[sighs]

18:06.289 --> 18:07.540
[knocking continues]

18:09.709 --> 18:11.377
This the door you want fixed?

18:12.587 --> 18:14.422
You called for an estimate.

18:14.505 --> 18:15.631
You're early.

18:15.715 --> 18:17.217
We're three hours late.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.594
[speaking Portuguese]

18:19.677 --> 18:21.762
Uh, this is a very broken door.

18:23.014 --> 18:27.143
Thank you for the diagnosis.
What's it gonna cost me?

18:27.227 --> 18:28.770
[conversing in Portuguese]

18:36.277 --> 18:38.154
You got the decimal in the wrong place.

18:38.238 --> 18:39.489
[speaking Portuguese]

18:44.535 --> 18:45.996
My father says,
"This is our business,

18:46.079 --> 18:48.164
not a charity
for women with broken doors."

18:48.248 --> 18:50.541
- Just fix the goddamn door. I'll cover it.
- [cell phone vibrating]

18:50.625 --> 18:53.128
- We start tomorrow.
- Well, be on time.

18:54.379 --> 18:55.755
Trish?

18:55.839 --> 18:58.299
[Trish sighs] <i>The interview is set</i>
<i>for tomorrow. You wanna be here?</i>

18:58.383 --> 19:00.718
- You found a brainwashing expert?
<i>- Better.</i>

19:00.801 --> 19:02.971
And I gotta say,
Jeri is a force of nature.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.848
<i>She is the one that made it happen.</i>

19:04.931 --> 19:06.975
Jeri... Hogarth?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.810
We're doing a live remote
with Hope from the prison.

19:09.895 --> 19:11.229
No.

19:11.312 --> 19:13.064
<i>Jess, you asked me to defend her.</i>

19:13.148 --> 19:15.775
Yeah, not to drag her out in public
with her guts hanging out.

19:15.859 --> 19:18.569
Hey, it's me. I'm on her side.
I'll go easy.

19:18.653 --> 19:19.988
Trish, he'll be listening.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.948
- He wouldn't miss it.
<i>- Probably not.</i>

19:22.032 --> 19:25.118
He'll be listening to her
and thinking about me.

19:26.161 --> 19:28.872
He's already thinking about you.

19:33.626 --> 19:34.794
Thank you.

19:35.836 --> 19:39.757
Hope wants to fight back
and I want to help her.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.926
Okay?

19:41.009 --> 19:43.136
<i>Jess, okay?</i>

19:47.390 --> 19:49.225
[cell phone beeps]

19:49.309 --> 19:50.560
[blues music playing]

19:59.235 --> 20:00.736
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.701
Sorry that I took off the other night.

20:06.784 --> 20:09.579
Hard to know when to bring up a dead wife.

20:12.832 --> 20:14.625
Do you know any drug dealers?

20:14.709 --> 20:15.960
[scoffs]

20:17.462 --> 20:20.256
I own a bar in Hell's Kitchen.
What do you think?

20:20.340 --> 20:22.050
I need a drug.

20:26.054 --> 20:27.222
[Luke] Any drug?

20:28.056 --> 20:30.391
You're gonna have to be
more specific than that.

20:31.267 --> 20:33.186
It's called Sufentanil. It's...

20:34.562 --> 20:37.440
used to knock people out for surgery.

20:38.733 --> 20:40.276
Can't help you there.

20:41.527 --> 20:43.863
Is that really
why you came here at this hour?

20:43.947 --> 20:45.406
Well, I figured, NSA and all,

20:45.490 --> 20:47.617
you wouldn't want
to talk about this over the phone.

20:47.700 --> 20:48.909
[sighs]

20:49.827 --> 20:51.412
I appreciate that.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.627
[both sigh heavily]

21:00.755 --> 21:02.757
[Luke breathing heavily]

21:06.052 --> 21:07.845
Sweet Christmas.

21:08.554 --> 21:10.306
[exhales sharply] Yeah.

21:12.392 --> 21:13.559
I think.

21:14.477 --> 21:16.021
[both chuckle]

21:21.609 --> 21:22.610
[sighs]

21:24.654 --> 21:26.364
Just say it, woman.

21:29.575 --> 21:31.244
Say what?

21:31.327 --> 21:33.871
Whatever it is you've not been saying
since I met you.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.250
I haven't... not said anything.

21:38.959 --> 21:40.211
Is it a racial thing?

21:41.504 --> 21:43.464
[exhales sharply] I'm kidding.

21:49.137 --> 21:50.388
- Is it?
- [exhales sharply]

21:59.897 --> 22:01.941
[Jessica sighs]

22:04.444 --> 22:07.363
Maybe it's about this thing...
[sighs heavily]

22:07.447 --> 22:09.032
that we have.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.744
These abilities.

22:15.496 --> 22:17.915
What if there was
someone else out there...

22:19.334 --> 22:23.088
but his ability was to make people
do whatever he wanted?

22:24.672 --> 22:26.757
You mean like mind control?

22:32.012 --> 22:34.099
Or exactly mind control.

22:35.975 --> 22:37.643
[inhales sharply]

22:37.727 --> 22:40.980
Is this about your case
the cops grilled me about?

22:41.063 --> 22:43.733
The girl who shot her folks
in your building,

22:43.816 --> 22:45.443
claims some guy made her do it?

22:47.653 --> 22:49.322
Maybe she's telling the truth.

22:50.531 --> 22:52.032
Maybe she's nuts.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.494
You go into a bar any night of the week,

22:54.577 --> 22:57.872
you'll find some crazies
arguing with the voices in their heads.

23:06.506 --> 23:08.216
What if I believed her?

23:10.135 --> 23:11.636
Would that change your mind?

23:12.553 --> 23:15.640
I'd believe that you believed it.

23:19.269 --> 23:21.687
Says the man with unbreakable skin.

23:24.064 --> 23:25.650
You can see my skin.

23:26.609 --> 23:27.902
You can touch it.

23:29.237 --> 23:32.365
But you got no idea
what my mind is thinking.

23:43.459 --> 23:45.002
I think I do.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.756
[sighs] Okay, then.

23:55.638 --> 23:58.140
I got no idea what you're thinking.

24:05.773 --> 24:07.275
I think you do.

24:18.494 --> 24:20.788
[Hope] It was my mother's birthday.

24:22.832 --> 24:24.625
He made me call her

24:24.709 --> 24:27.337
because she'd have known
something was wrong if I didn't.

24:27.420 --> 24:31.466
<i>And I wanted to tell her
that I was in trouble</i>

24:31.549 --> 24:34.760
<i>and that he was holding me prisoner.</i>

24:36.178 --> 24:39.682
<i>And making me do things
that I've never done,</i>

24:39.765 --> 24:42.142
<i>that I never would do.</i>

24:42.227 --> 24:45.771
<i>I wanted to tell her and my dad
to come and get me.</i>

24:45.855 --> 24:47.273
But you didn't.

24:48.399 --> 24:54.864
The words were in my head,
but way in the back, like this tiny echo.

24:54.947 --> 24:57.700
[Trish] <i>What was happening?</i>
<i>Can you describe it?</i>

25:00.245 --> 25:04.249
All I could feel was this need.

25:05.207 --> 25:07.001
<i>He said, "Wish her a happy birthday,"</i>

25:07.084 --> 25:10.129
<i>and that was suddenly
the only thing that I wanted to say.</i>

25:10.212 --> 25:12.798
That was the last time I spoke to her

25:12.882 --> 25:17.052
before she and my dad came to find me,

25:17.136 --> 25:19.680
<i>to rescue me.</i>

25:20.973 --> 25:26.646
And the whole time you were with Kilgrave,
you were aware you were being controlled.

25:27.272 --> 25:32.693
[Hope] <i>Not at first,</i>
<i>but then I'd get these glimpses of myself.</i>

25:32.777 --> 25:34.945
<i>And I'd try to hold onto them...</i>

25:36.406 --> 25:38.616
[voice breaking]
<i>but I wasn't strong enough.</i>

25:39.784 --> 25:41.494
[crying] But when he told me...

25:43.162 --> 25:45.873
to do that to my parents...

25:48.793 --> 25:51.671
[sobbing] I fought so hard.

25:51.754 --> 25:53.381
<i>But I couldn't...</i>

25:54.590 --> 25:56.676
[Trish] Hope, did you love your parents?

25:56.759 --> 25:59.094
Yes, so much.

25:59.178 --> 26:01.221
[Trish] <i>Did you want to shoot them?</i>

26:01.306 --> 26:02.307
No!

26:02.390 --> 26:03.558
Then why did you do it?

26:03.641 --> 26:07.019
Because Kilgrave wanted me to.

26:07.102 --> 26:08.479
<i>Because he made me.</i>

26:10.481 --> 26:15.152
As you can see, Trish, my client's
delusion is quite fully formed.

26:16.654 --> 26:20.450
Wait, you're dismissing the possibility
that Hope is telling the truth?

26:20.533 --> 26:23.411
That she was telepathically
compelled to kill her own parents?

26:23.494 --> 26:26.331
It's unprecedented,
to say the least.

26:26.414 --> 26:29.584
As was the city being attacked by aliens,
but it happened.

26:29.667 --> 26:32.753
Buildings were destroyed,
people were killed.

26:32.837 --> 26:36.131
Perhaps what happened to Hope
has happened before.

26:36.215 --> 26:37.674
[Hogarth] <i>Well, certainly,</i>
<i>if there are other people</i>

26:37.758 --> 26:39.844
who feel they have been controlled
by this Kilgrave character,

26:39.927 --> 26:43.973
they are more than welcome
to contact my office,

26:44.056 --> 26:47.852
<i>but it is more likely that my client
experienced a psychotic break.</i>

26:47.935 --> 26:51.689
Uh, Hope has no history of mental illness,
has shown no evidence since...

26:51.772 --> 26:54.191
Trish, sounds like you believe
this Kilgrave is real.

26:57.945 --> 27:00.573
I believe it's naive to assume he isn't.

27:00.656 --> 27:03.325
So yes, I think he's out there,

27:03.409 --> 27:05.703
this sick, perverted man...

27:05.786 --> 27:07.079
No, Trish!
Trish, shut up.

27:07.162 --> 27:08.914
He is preying on the hopeless
so he can feel powerful,

27:08.998 --> 27:11.709
probably terrified of his own weakness,
which suggests impotence.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.293
You need to cut her mic right now.

27:13.378 --> 27:15.505
- We're in the middle of a broadcast.
- Cut it!

27:15.588 --> 27:17.923
Probably suggests
some serious Oedipal issues...

27:18.007 --> 27:19.800
[buzzing]

27:19.884 --> 27:22.177
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trish! He's listening, hearing you...

27:22.261 --> 27:25.055
- He'll hear the truth.
- He doesn't want the truth!

27:25.139 --> 27:28.142
<i>We've got a few calls coming in.
Let's start with Susan in Vinegar Hill.</i>

27:28.225 --> 27:30.811
- [Susan] <i>Hey, Trish! Thanks for having...</i>
- [dial tone]

27:30.895 --> 27:32.980
- Trish. You're gonna piss him off, Trish.
- [telephone ringing]

27:33.063 --> 27:35.232
- Good.
- No, not good.

27:35.315 --> 27:38.819
So he gets to run around,
destroying lives, destroying your life,

27:38.903 --> 27:40.530
and I have to just sit here and shut up?

27:40.613 --> 27:42.615
Yes! Until I neutralize him.

27:42.698 --> 27:44.617
Next caller.

27:44.700 --> 27:47.620
[Kilgrave] <i>First-time caller,</i>
<i>long-time listener.</i>

27:47.703 --> 27:50.289
<i>Trish, I want to applaud your courage.</i>

27:50.372 --> 27:53.125
<i>You've always been a hero
to the downtrodden.</i>

27:53.208 --> 27:54.794
<i>Self-preservation be damned.</i>

27:54.877 --> 27:56.045
[echoing] <i>It's admirable.</i>

27:56.128 --> 28:01.759
<i>But my question is, if there really is
a man with the abilities you've described,</i>

28:01.842 --> 28:06.431
<i>someone who could make anyone, anywhere,
do whatever he wanted them to do...</i>

28:07.723 --> 28:11.769
<i>seems to me that insulting him
would be wildly dangerous.</i>

28:11.852 --> 28:15.230
<i>Or, let's just say it,
stupid in the extreme.</i>

28:15.314 --> 28:18.150
<i>Everyone has feelings, even,
um, how did you put it?</i>

28:18.233 --> 28:20.736
<i>- Sadistic, corrosive men.</i>
- No!

28:24.364 --> 28:25.574
[wailing] No!

28:25.658 --> 28:29.036
[Kilgrave] <i>Are you worried he might,</i>
<i>I don't know, make you kill yourself?</i>

28:29.119 --> 28:30.329
<i>Or worse?</i>

28:30.412 --> 28:32.832
<i>I'll take my answer off the air.</i>

28:36.919 --> 28:39.922
{an8}I had to defend Hope.
Hogarth was throwing her under a bus.

28:40.005 --> 28:44.259
Hogarth set you up to defend
the crazy-ass notion of mind control.

28:44.343 --> 28:45.635
[Trish] So she wouldn't have to.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.681
God, that is so... smart.

28:48.764 --> 28:50.475
And evil, of course.

28:50.558 --> 28:52.017
You insulted him, Trish.

28:52.101 --> 28:54.311
You put yourself in Kilgrave's crosshairs.

28:54.394 --> 28:56.939
He could be sending
some poor asshole to kill you right now.

28:57.022 --> 28:59.567
It's a good thing you built a fortress.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.694
Just stay close to me.

29:01.777 --> 29:03.195
- Where's your car?
- Patsy Walker?

29:04.238 --> 29:05.280
- Oh, my God.
- [man grunting]

29:06.198 --> 29:08.576
- He grabbed me.
- Oh, shit.

29:09.326 --> 29:10.578
He's a fan?

29:10.661 --> 29:12.205
- [rasping] Autograph?
- You're a fan. Oh, I'm...

29:12.287 --> 29:15.290
Oh, my God, I'm so, so sorry.
[stuttering]

29:15.374 --> 29:16.791
- I miss your red hair.
- Sorry, I... [stammering]

29:16.876 --> 29:19.044
Okay, come on, we have to go.
Come on, we have to go.

29:19.128 --> 29:21.421
[stammering] I gotta go, I'm sorry!

29:21.506 --> 29:24.467
Wow, Jess, I think I really hurt that guy.

29:24.550 --> 29:27.637
I hate feeling this way,
I don't know how you handle it.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.555
It's called whiskey.

29:29.639 --> 29:31.724
Here, I put an app on this.
It tells me where you are.

29:31.807 --> 29:34.059
Keep it on you, don't leave.
Set your alarm.

29:34.143 --> 29:35.394
Where are you going?

29:35.478 --> 29:38.064
- To get some goddamn drugs.
- [elevator dings]

29:39.899 --> 29:42.192
- [elevator dings]
- Check again.

29:42.276 --> 29:44.361
It's Dr. Kurata.

29:44.444 --> 29:46.405
David Kurata with a "K," yeah.

29:46.489 --> 29:49.950
He... He teaches
in the biology department.

29:50.034 --> 29:51.494
Or chemistry. I don't know.

29:51.577 --> 29:53.245
Is bio-chemistry a thing?

29:53.328 --> 29:55.330
I don't know which one,
it's science.

29:55.414 --> 29:58.417
Just check them all, it's important.
Yeah, I'll hold.

29:58.501 --> 29:59.794
[sighs]

30:04.423 --> 30:05.549
[keys jangling]

30:07.552 --> 30:09.095
- [rattling]
- [sighs exasperatedly]

30:10.930 --> 30:13.348
What? [exhales sharply]

30:20.105 --> 30:21.148
{an8}[sighs]

30:21.231 --> 30:23.025
- Shit.
- [paper crumpling]

30:25.736 --> 30:27.112
[lock breaks]

30:27.196 --> 30:29.782
Wait, when did he quit?

30:29.865 --> 30:31.534
Did he leave a forwarding address?

30:35.245 --> 30:36.872
2112...

30:38.165 --> 30:39.374
Parliament Street.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.960
New Delhi.

30:41.043 --> 30:42.211
India?

30:44.714 --> 30:47.466
I guess when the man runs, he runs.

30:47.550 --> 30:48.551
[sighs]

30:48.634 --> 30:49.635
[elevator dings]

30:50.803 --> 30:52.388
[Ruben grunting] Okay.

30:52.471 --> 30:55.932
[straining] Right foot, then left foot.

30:57.309 --> 30:59.561
[grunts] You have to use your knees.

31:00.855 --> 31:02.189
That's it.

31:02.272 --> 31:04.191
Oh, hey, Jessica.

31:04.274 --> 31:06.944
Uh, he's heavier than he looks.

31:07.945 --> 31:10.322
And he keeps listing to the right.

31:10.405 --> 31:13.951
He came into our apartment by mistake.

31:14.034 --> 31:18.247
[pants] Guess I forgot to lock the door
after I took out the trash.

31:18.330 --> 31:19.664
[sighs]

31:19.749 --> 31:21.542
[Malcolm] The elevator went too high.

31:21.626 --> 31:23.169
[Jessica] You're too high.

31:23.252 --> 31:25.212
Mmm. [sighs]
Hey, am I bleeding?

31:25.295 --> 31:26.546
You're fine.

31:27.632 --> 31:29.884
Robyn was asleep.

31:29.967 --> 31:32.803
I was in the other room
with my beetle collection

31:32.887 --> 31:35.222
and I heard the door

31:35.305 --> 31:38.183
and then there he was.

31:38.267 --> 31:41.228
- Eating our peanut butter.
- [sighs]

31:41.311 --> 31:42.647
Robyn was so scared.

31:42.730 --> 31:45.565
She thought he was a rapist or something,
till I turned the light on.

31:45.650 --> 31:47.818
It's broad daylight.

31:47.902 --> 31:49.820
We have foil over the windows.

31:49.904 --> 31:52.489
Why? No. I don't want to know.

31:53.198 --> 31:55.325
She hit me with a little man.

31:55.409 --> 31:56.785
- [sniffs]
- It was a trophy.

31:56.869 --> 31:58.621
[sighs] Of a little man.

31:58.704 --> 32:01.165
It was a little woman, actually.

32:01.248 --> 32:03.834
Bowling trophy.
She bowls like a dream.

32:03.918 --> 32:05.085
[sighs]

32:05.169 --> 32:07.630
- Am I bleeding now?
- No, you're still fine.

32:07.713 --> 32:11.091
I mean, I guess he is kinda scary,
if you just wake up

32:11.175 --> 32:13.593
and you don't know him
and maybe you're a bit racist.

32:13.678 --> 32:15.638
Go. Lie down.

32:15.721 --> 32:17.473
- Keys!
- [clatters]

32:17.556 --> 32:19.599
- They say everyone is a little...
- [door slams]

32:20.893 --> 32:22.687
Everyone's a little what?

32:22.770 --> 32:24.521
Everyone's a little racist.

32:24.604 --> 32:29.318
Like, if you see someone like Malcolm,
you make a snap judgment, you know?

32:29.401 --> 32:31.236
It's something to overcome.

32:37.993 --> 32:39.870
[Malcolm] Hmm, this hospital smells.

32:41.413 --> 32:44.208
But why are we in a hospital?
I mean... [blows raspberry]

32:45.125 --> 32:48.628
I mean, I feel... I feel pretty all right.
You know? I feel...

32:48.713 --> 32:49.755
[sniffs]

32:49.839 --> 32:52.341
Look, I appreciate the concern, I do.

32:52.424 --> 32:54.927
[chuckling] It's all so...
It's nice.

32:55.010 --> 32:56.136
I don't really need to be...

32:56.220 --> 32:57.679
- [Jessica] Sorry about this.
- What?

32:58.848 --> 33:00.350
- [supplies clattering]
- [Malcom groaning]

33:01.391 --> 33:04.353
Oh, my God, somebody help!
Somebody help!

33:04.436 --> 33:05.437
[woman] What happened?

33:05.520 --> 33:06.731
He just lunged at her!

33:06.814 --> 33:08.816
- [hospital staff clamoring]
- [Malcolm groaning]

33:08.899 --> 33:11.110
- [doctor 1] All right. Keep still.
- [doctor 2] Don't move.

33:13.403 --> 33:15.447
[guard] We need someone over here, please.
Give me a hand?

34:01.160 --> 34:02.619
[doorbell ringing]

34:05.205 --> 34:06.331
Shit.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.252
[clears throat]

34:10.335 --> 34:11.585
Yes?

34:11.670 --> 34:13.505
I'm looking for
Ms. Patricia Walker?

34:14.714 --> 34:16.257
This is she.
How can I help you?

34:16.341 --> 34:17.802
I need to ask you some questions

34:17.885 --> 34:20.929
about an alleged assault
that happened outside station WNEX.

34:21.931 --> 34:23.139
[softly] Damn it.

34:26.768 --> 34:29.103
[clears throat] Ask away, Officer...

34:29.188 --> 34:30.647
Simpson.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.649
Uh, ma'am, can you open the door?

34:32.732 --> 34:34.150
You know,
I'd prefer to talk with you in person.

34:36.027 --> 34:38.530
I'm sorry, uh, can I see
some identification, please?

34:38.612 --> 34:39.697
[Simpson] Mmm-hmm.

34:46.455 --> 34:47.831
That's you, all right.
[chuckles nervously]

34:48.748 --> 34:52.502
You know, the guy that was assaulted
ended up in the hospital.

34:52.585 --> 34:54.504
He says that you attacked him.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.177
Maybe I should call my lawyer first.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.179
Ma'am, I know who you are.

35:02.262 --> 35:05.015
And you should know that if I have
to come back here with an arrest warrant,

35:05.099 --> 35:08.518
then the chances are
this whole business ends up on the news.

35:09.979 --> 35:11.730
Which I'm sure that you're used to,

35:11.814 --> 35:14.609
[chuckling] but it wouldn't be
my first choice.

35:20.155 --> 35:21.365
Suit yourself.

35:24.076 --> 35:25.452
Hold on.

35:27.454 --> 35:28.663
[sighs]

35:32.501 --> 35:33.668

36:06.493 --> 36:07.870
You don't want to do this.

36:07.953 --> 36:10.039
- Yes, I do.
- No!

36:17.922 --> 36:19.214
[Trish grunting]

36:39.234 --> 36:40.360
Get off her!

36:41.695 --> 36:43.029
[grunting]

36:44.990 --> 36:46.533
Trish, talk to me.

36:46.616 --> 36:48.118
- It'll be all right.
- [gasping]

36:48.202 --> 36:49.369
I have to kill her.

36:49.453 --> 36:50.745
Not gonna happen.

36:50.829 --> 36:51.996
[Simpson] I have to!

36:53.123 --> 36:55.000
- He's waiting for me!
- Where?

36:55.792 --> 36:56.793
I can't tell you.

37:03.175 --> 37:04.551
[grunts]

37:06.511 --> 37:08.430
- Trish, Trish.

37:18.523 --> 37:19.649
You killed her!

37:21.986 --> 37:23.403
Trish.

37:24.779 --> 37:27.824
Trish. Trish.
[breathing heavily]

37:41.505 --> 37:43.757
Okay. You're gonna feel better
in a few hours.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.175
I'm sorry.

37:47.302 --> 37:48.888
[exhales sharply]

37:49.638 --> 37:51.515
You son of a bitch!

37:51.598 --> 37:52.975
You son of a bitch.

37:53.058 --> 37:54.685
- I don't wanna shoot you.

- [Simpson] <i>Very.</i>

39:30.114 --> 39:33.325
[Kilgrave] <i>Well, a lot of people will be.</i>
<i>Patsy was such an icon.</i>

39:33.408 --> 39:36.161
<i>Personally, I always thought
her television show was shite.</i>

39:36.245 --> 39:37.329
<i>Honestly, Patsy was a...</i>

39:37.412 --> 39:39.498
grating teenage do-gooder.

39:39.581 --> 39:41.833
So sanctimonious.

39:41.916 --> 39:44.919
Why Jessica was so attached to her,
I'll never understand.

39:45.003 --> 39:46.170
[woman] Here's your lunch, sir.

39:46.255 --> 39:49.174

That way.

No, no, no!

- [groans]

I caught you, okay?
You did what he said. It's over.

48:24.856 --> 48:29.653
I did? I remember I was
about to leap off, and then you...

- You caught me?
- I fell with you.

48:32.446 --> 48:33.614
You grabbed me?

No. No, you didn't.

49:10.819 --> 49:12.821
- I killed her.
- You're confused.

49:12.904 --> 49:15.406
No one died, nothing happened.
Okay?

49:15.489 --> 49:16.700
Just go home.

49:18.534 --> 49:19.868
[exhales sharply]

49:43.684 --> 49:44.852
[door opens]

49:51.192 --> 49:52.693
Rough night?

49:57.824 --> 50:01.160
- I did something.
- Looks like it.

50:02.411 --> 50:03.621
[door creaking]

50:06.833 --> 50:08.167
I can't come in.

50:10.962 --> 50:12.171
Ever.

50:13.923 --> 50:15.383
This isn't right.

50:17.551 --> 50:18.636
Feels right to me.

50:18.719 --> 50:20.179
I have business.

50:21.555 --> 50:22.556
Unfinished.

50:22.640 --> 50:26.101
And you've been [sighs]
through too much for me to...

50:26.185 --> 50:28.062
Can't handle a dead wife, huh?

50:37.864 --> 50:40.033
[inhales sharply]
Do what you gotta do.

50:43.870 --> 50:44.996
[door closes]

50:56.549 --> 50:58.426
[indistinct talking]

50:59.635 --> 51:01.094
[door opening]
