38:44.907 --> 38:46.693

38:46.783 --> 38:49.741

I am so sorry to intrude on your Saturday,
but I did want to bring you up to speed.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.371
We're happy to hear from you whenever.

39:02.466 --> 39:05.708
As you know,
we had the second autopsy done.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.959
The doctor from Georgia.

39:07.054 --> 39:12.765
Right, Dr. Sperry. He's definitively ruled out
trauma from the bar fight as a cause of death.

39:12.851 --> 39:17.845
He agrees with Dr. Minyard that your son
died from natural causes, from asthma.

39:19.441 --> 39:23.935
We know that your son
was left untreated for several hours.

39:25.030 --> 39:29.865
Dr. Sperry's expert opinion
is that Billy's asthma was survivable

39:29.952 --> 39:31.863
given the proper treatment.

39:31.954 --> 39:34.320
He should have had his inhaler.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.406
And when his condition worsened,
he should have been sent to the hospital.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.037
Sounds like negligence to me.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.708
It does to me as well.

39:40.796 --> 39:44.960
How could they have done that to him?
Walk away and just let him die?

39:45.801 --> 39:47.257
I don't know.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.881
What kind of person does that?

39:49.972 --> 39:52.884
That's a good question, Mrs. Gilday.

39:52.975 --> 39:56.217
It's a question I ask myself
not only in your son's case,

39:56.311 --> 39:58.302
but often in my work.

39:59.273 --> 40:02.686
And I'm afraid
I don't have a good answer for it.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.562
Somebody has to be accountable.
God damn it.

40:04.653 --> 40:07.736
-Shh, Bill.
-Well, I would file on your behalf

40:07.823 --> 40:10.610
a federal civil rights case

40:10.701 --> 40:14.990
against the sheriff and the jail staff
for violating Billy's civil rights.

40:15.747 --> 40:20.616
It would be deliberate indifference
to a serious medical need and for negligence.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.542
It won't bring our Billy back.

40:22.629 --> 40:27.874
There have been several deaths at the jail
like your son's.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.466
Preventable deaths.

40:30.554 --> 40:35.765
This isn't some random acts of neglect
by bad individuals,

40:35.851 --> 40:41.096
but this is a pattern and practice
of violating people's rights at the jail

40:41.189 --> 40:43.601
and it has been going on for years.

40:43.692 --> 40:49.608
So I hope you'll do this not only for your son,
but also for someone else's son or daughter.

40:50.866 --> 40:53.232
