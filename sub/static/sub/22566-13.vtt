00:17.685 --> 00:20.654
FEMALE NARRATOR:
Previously on
The Girlfriend Experience...

00:20.754 --> 00:22.156
KOSCIELNY:
Do you know
who Martin Hoban is?

00:22.256 --> 00:24.024
ERICA:
The Canadian industrialist.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.394
What's your relationship
with Hoban?

00:26.494 --> 00:30.131
Let's just say we have
similar business interests.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.800
As a non US citizen,
it's illegal for Mr. Hoban

00:32.900 --> 00:35.969
to make donations
to US super PACS

00:36.070 --> 00:37.838
and it's illegal for me
to accept them.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.273
That won't be a problem.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.209
I want you to delete
any correspondence between

00:41.309 --> 00:42.910
Koscielny and Chiesurin,
everything.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.613
Emails, texts, phone logs...

00:45.713 --> 00:48.182
- Any record of this meeting.
- What's going on?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.618
[ sighs ]
No...just do it.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.685
What are you doing?

00:51.785 --> 00:54.088
You know exactly what I'm doing.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.395
I don't know
what she sees in you.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.800
She received a donation
from Citizens First

01:06.900 --> 01:08.302
a shell company
registered in Toronto

01:08.402 --> 01:11.472
controlled by Martin Hoban,
a Canadian businessman.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.440
It's all in there.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.807
What did she
give him in return?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.876
I don't know.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.812
I need you to continue
monitoring her.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.781
No way. You said this was it.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.015
I can't.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.817
Here.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.219
I could lose my job.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.787
No one will ever find out.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.091
It's ten thousand dollars.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.362
It's your choice,
if you don't want it

01:34.462 --> 01:36.797
all you have to do is leave.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.700
But if you continue,
you will make a lot of money.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.372
Trust me, no one
will ever find out.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.474
You want to be
on the right side of this.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.187
There's one more thing.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.489
She's an alcoholic.

02:01.589 --> 02:02.423
She's drinking heavily
on the job

02:02.523 --> 02:04.592
and it's getting out of control.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.584
Erica Myles met
with Peter Koscielny

02:30.684 --> 02:33.354
and personally solicited
the donation.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.889
Here are the files
that show the transfer.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.725
And it'd be good
to start leaking it.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.859
Understood.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.763
[ indistinct chatter ]

02:45.733 --> 02:47.067
Well, the networks
are increasing coverage

02:47.167 --> 02:48.469
which will mean more donors

02:48.569 --> 02:49.770
which will be
crucial for Ohio...

02:49.870 --> 02:51.839
[ clears throat ]

02:51.939 --> 02:53.841
Can I talk to you for a second?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.609
I've got to go.
Call you back.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.347
- What is it?
- Look, uh...

02:59.447 --> 03:01.181
I don't want to be an alarmist

03:01.282 --> 03:03.684
but I've been hearing rumors
about Erica.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.186
Aside from that mess
with the Attorney General

03:06.287 --> 03:09.022
the FBI is apparently
looking into the donation

03:09.122 --> 03:10.824
Erica solicited
from Peter Koscielny.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.263
Erica!

03:17.865 --> 03:18.932
We need to talk.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.902
What is it?

03:24.305 --> 03:25.973
I just spoke with Sam Perez.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.207
He's hearing rumors
that the FBI

03:27.308 --> 03:28.942
is looking into
the Koscielny donation.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.143
- What?
- Are we at risk?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.446
No, of course not.
I vetted him. He's clean.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.814
- Are you sure?
- One thousand percent.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.082
Then why are people talking?

03:35.182 --> 03:37.918
I have no idea.
People talk all the time.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.620
Well, you might want
to find out.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.530
SANDRA:
I'll let her know
that you called.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.566
I know.
That's the best I can do.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.502
Yes, I passed that along,
and she will get back to you

03:54.602 --> 03:57.037
as soon as she can. Yes...

03:57.137 --> 04:00.374
I need to speak with you
in my office, now.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.842
She'll get back to you.

04:10.951 --> 04:11.952
Shut the door.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.059
What do you know
about Martin Hoban?

04:19.159 --> 04:21.429
Nothing. Who is he?

04:21.529 --> 04:24.197
Is he behind Citizens First?

04:24.298 --> 04:26.600
Did anyone ask you about him?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.869
No.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.405
- No one?
- No, no one.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.407
Are you telling the truth?

04:33.507 --> 04:37.010
Yes. What's going on?
You're scaring me.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.679
Apparently, the FBI

04:38.779 --> 04:41.715
are looking into
the Koscielny donation.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.183
Oh, my God.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.585
And if they find out who he is

04:44.685 --> 04:47.187
I'm gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.357
Who is he?

04:49.457 --> 04:50.924
I can't tell you,
but if they contact you

04:51.024 --> 04:53.927
don't mention him
or the re-registration.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.363
- Nothing.
- Okay.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.964
You can't say anything.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.399
I won't. Don't worry.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.135
Okay.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.671
Thanks.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.031
Did anyone else contact you
about Martin Hoban?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.433
No one. Why?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.935
Apparently, the FBI
are looking into the donation.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.804
If they contact you,
please don't tell them

05:36.904 --> 05:39.339
that I asked you
to look into him.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.241
I can't do that.
That would be illegal.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.677
Come on, Matt.
No one has to know.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.479
If you keep it to yourself,
they'll move on.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.649
I already told you,
I can't do that.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.485
And maybe it's better if you
find someone else to work with.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.120
I don't think
I can help you anymore.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.257
- Matt...
- I'm sorry.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.559
I have to go.

05:59.893 --> 06:00.894
Goodbye, Erica.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.067
You look well.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.469
I am.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.871
You look tired.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.140
I'm not sleeping...

06:47.240 --> 06:49.643
...well these days.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.079
Got some problems at work,
and Darya and I

06:52.179 --> 06:54.181
parted ways for good.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.349
- What happened?
- I don't know.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.952
We realized it just
wasn't gonna work.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.925
I guess we really never
loved each other.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.126
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.763
- Don't be.
- Excuse me.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.602
Hi there.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.638
At 8:00? That's fine.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.840
I'm really looking forward
to seeing you.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.012
That sounds wonderful.
See you soon.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.882
Bye.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.160
Are you still pregnant?

07:41.762 --> 07:43.964
No. I had an abortion.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.669
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.238
Maybe we can try again one day.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.774
I'd really like
a child together.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.711
Don't. I have to go.
I'm meeting a client soon.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.748
Perhaps we could have
dinner one night?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.950
I'm very busy. I have to go.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.854
Can I call you?

08:06.954 --> 08:09.156
I-I won't have time.
Good luck with work.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.695
- Anna...
- Why are you here?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.531
Because I love you.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.633
And I'm so sorry
that I hurt you.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.469
I...hate myself for that.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.171
Please give us another chance.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.973
I know that we can make it work

08:26.073 --> 08:28.609
and that we can be happy.
I know that.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.310
Leave me alone.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.712
Please!

08:33.180 --> 08:34.214
[ sobbing ]

09:22.796 --> 09:24.164

[ sighs ]

10:13.146 --> 10:14.181
I'm sorry.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.278
What do you want?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.149
Just lie with me.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.365
Did you miss me?

11:29.489 --> 11:30.958
I missed you.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.399
[ breathing heavily ]

12:01.154 --> 12:02.355
Have a seat.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.527
I wanna talk to you about Erica.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.762
Okay.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.663
I've been hearing rumors
about her.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.633
Serious ones.
You work closely with her.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.803
Yes, I do.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.438
What do you know
about Peter Koscielny?

12:18.538 --> 12:19.672
I don't know anything except

12:19.773 --> 12:22.275
that he gave us
twenty-five million dollars.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.410
Why?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.114
I just need to know
what's going on.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.519
I'm going to need
some incentive.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.622
What do you want?

12:35.722 --> 12:38.158
I hear Melissa Daniels
might be leaving.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.393
I want to be considered
for her position.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.431
Okay.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.837
That twenty-five
million dollar donation

12:49.937 --> 12:52.039
from Peter Koscielny
was actually just a front

12:52.139 --> 12:54.607
for Martin Hoban,
a Canadian businessman

12:54.707 --> 12:56.443
with substantial holdings
in the oil and gas

12:56.543 --> 12:58.812
industry in Alberta.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.581
Instead of reporting it,
Erica tried to bury it.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.083
How?

13:03.183 --> 13:05.118
She told me to delete
all records of her interactions

13:05.218 --> 13:08.421
with Koscielny
and did the same herself.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.723
Oh, and when I went
to her house

13:10.824 --> 13:13.693
I found her blind drunk, and was
forced to shower her half-naked

13:13.793 --> 13:15.896
because she could barely stand.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.430
She's a trainwreck.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.141
[ rattling ]

13:40.954 --> 13:43.590

- Here.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.227
Thanks.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.787
Where's Jim?
Do you know where he is?

14:14.888 --> 14:15.889
No. I haven't seen him
since this morning.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.158
I think he may out for the day,
but I'm not sure.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.930
MELISSA:
He isn't happy at Craswell.
I know he'd agree to a meeting.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.231
What's going on?
Why is my office locked?

14:24.331 --> 14:25.999
Why doesn't my key card work?

14:26.099 --> 14:27.467
SIMONS:
Can you give us a minute?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.102
Are you gonna tell me?

14:30.670 --> 14:34.474
Who are you calling? Security?

14:34.574 --> 14:38.145
Why are you calling security?
Why are you calling security?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.080
What's the matter, you can't
do your dirty work by yourself?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.515
You got to call daddy
to come and fucking help you?

14:42.615 --> 14:43.883
You've been terminated.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.956
- On what grounds?
- Incompetence.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.924
Insubordination,
unauthorized absences

14:51.024 --> 14:53.393
and possible criminal behavior.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.495
What criminal behavior?
What are you talking about?

14:55.595 --> 14:58.598
- Don't embarrass yourself.
- What are you talking about?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.167
Mr. Simons.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.102
What criminal behavior?

15:02.202 --> 15:03.803
We'll send you
your personal belongings

15:03.903 --> 15:05.172
and you'll be hearing
from our attorneys.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.573
Fuck you!

15:22.689 --> 15:25.425
- Mardian, what's going on?
- Keep walking.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.061
- Why am I being shut out?
- Can't talk about it.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.097
Are the FBI coming after me?

15:30.197 --> 15:31.464
Where did Perez
hear those rumors?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.366
Who's he been talking to?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.501
Jim, please!

15:36.169 --> 15:37.470
Are they coming after me?

15:38.638 --> 15:40.740
Yes.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.375
What do they know?
Did you speak with them?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.577
What do they know?

15:46.179 --> 15:48.115
What did you tell them?

15:48.215 --> 15:50.283
- What did you tell them?
- Back off!

16:01.161 --> 16:02.562
Erica, we spoke on the phone.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.963
- I'm Brent Crone.
- Hi.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.698
Noah's gonna meet us
in the conference room.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.899
Can I get you a water
or something?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.601
- Uh, no, I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.046
What am I facing?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.580
HUNT:
I really advise against

16:20.680 --> 16:21.614
speculating at this point.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.350
Just tell me.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.386
What's the worst case scenario?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.355
HUNT:
If, and again,
this is highly speculative

16:28.455 --> 16:30.923
but if they charge you
with both soliciting

16:31.024 --> 16:33.126
and receiving a donation
in violation

16:33.226 --> 16:36.529
of the Federal Election
Campaign Act and convict you

16:36.629 --> 16:40.067
you could be facing up to
10 years in a federal prison.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.769
But it is way too early
in the process

16:42.869 --> 16:45.272
to be making any assumptions.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.174
They haven't even
charged you with anything.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.242
Let's just take it
one step at a time.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.179
Let me call over to the FBI and
see what they have, if anything.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.484
I don't know
what I'm gonna do if anyone

16:57.584 --> 16:59.719
looks into that transaction,
I'm fucked.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.954
Maybe it is just a rumor.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.956
But what if it's not?
What if it's true?

17:04.057 --> 17:06.493
It will end my career,
I could go to prison.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.062
I'm sure even you
can understand that.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.098
What is that supposed to mean?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.100
Don't make this about you.
Not now.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.606
I'm fucked! What am I gonna do?

17:22.842 --> 17:23.976
You know, I used to admire you.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.845
I thought you were strong

17:25.945 --> 17:27.547
but now I realize
how weak you really are.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.116
You whine like a child.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.983
You created this mess,
why don't you solve it

17:31.084 --> 17:32.685
instead of drinking yourself
to death?

17:32.785 --> 17:34.954
Because there isn't a solution.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.789
Please don't start. Please.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.991
Not now, I can't take it now.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.593
I know I've got my faults
and I haven't

17:40.693 --> 17:42.862
treated you well, but I...

17:42.962 --> 17:45.998
- I love you.
- You hate me.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.334
Just like you hate yourself.
You're full of hate.

17:47.434 --> 17:51.037
No! It's not true. I love you.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.805
I adore you.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.345
You stink.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.849
Kiss me.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.559
There's nothing there.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.175
I won't remember you.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.643
I never remember anything
that hurts me.

18:47.059 --> 18:47.860
[ door opens ]

19:13.085 --> 19:15.622
[ wind blowing ]

19:38.211 --> 19:39.379
[ glass shattering ]

20:19.386 --> 20:20.387
[ Erica sighs ]

20:20.487 --> 20:23.390
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.157
Just remember you're here
on your own accord.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.394
Don't react,
say as little as possible.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.429
We just need to see
what they have. That's it.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.530
Okay.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.677
Is it safe to assume that
in your role as Finance Director

20:44.777 --> 20:47.647
you are aware that soliciting
donations or accepting donations

20:47.747 --> 20:50.850
from a foreign individual
or entity are federal crimes?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.184
Yes.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.020
What's your relationship
with Martin Hoban?

20:55.788 --> 20:56.889
I don't know him.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.825
- Have you ever met him?
- No.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.427
Ever spoken to him or had

21:00.527 --> 21:02.128
any correspondence
with him at all?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.130
No.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.832
Did you personally solicit
a donation

21:05.932 --> 21:08.535
from him on behalf
of Right To Action?

21:08.635 --> 21:11.404
- No.
- Are you sure?

21:11.504 --> 21:12.872
My client already responded.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.073
Did Right To Action accept

21:14.173 --> 21:15.775
a donation from Citizens First

21:15.875 --> 21:18.311
a company controlled
by Martin Hoban?

21:18.411 --> 21:20.413
I'd have to check my records.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.384
You don't recall
if Citizens First

21:24.484 --> 21:26.386
made a twenty-five
million dollar donation

21:26.486 --> 21:27.654
on October 4th

21:27.754 --> 21:28.821
three and a half weeks ago?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.390
You're badgering her.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.558
RAKITIC:
It's a straightforward
question.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.925
And she already responded.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.495
I remind you, Miss Myles
came in here voluntarily

21:35.595 --> 21:37.263
and she's
fully cooperating with you.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.232
- Do you know a Sandra Fuchs?
- Yes.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.234
- In what capacity?
- She's my assistant.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.203
- At Right To Action?
- Yes.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.172
RAKITIC:
Do you recall having
a conversation with her

21:46.272 --> 21:47.907
this past Tuesday
about Martin Hoban

21:48.007 --> 21:50.109
and a donation that he made
to Right To Action?

21:50.209 --> 21:51.678
No.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.154
ERICA:
Shut the door.

22:02.254 --> 22:05.224
What do you know
about Martin Hoban?

22:05.324 --> 22:07.960
SANDRA:
Nothing. Who is he?

22:08.060 --> 22:10.296
Is he behind Citizens First?

22:10.397 --> 22:11.798
ERICA:
Did anyone ask you about him?

22:13.032 --> 22:15.034
SANDRA:
No.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.203
- No one?
- No, no one.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.606
ERICA:
Are you telling the truth?

22:19.706 --> 22:22.108
SANDRA:
Yes. What's going on?
You're scaring me.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.776
ERICA:
Apparently, the FBI

22:23.876 --> 22:25.612
are looking into
the Koscielny donation.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.280
SANDRA:
Oh, my God.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.281
ERICA:
And if they find out who he is

22:29.382 --> 22:30.950
I'm gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.151
SANDRA:
Who is he?

22:32.251 --> 22:33.553
ERICA:
I can't tell you,
but if they contact you

22:33.653 --> 22:36.489
don't mention him or
the re-registration. Nothing.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.625
- Okay.
- You can't say anything.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.128
SANDRA:
I won't, don't worry.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.030
ERICA:
Okay. Thanks.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.174
I need to use the restroom.

22:55.274 --> 22:56.443
I'll be right back.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.033
701 Connecticut Avenue.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.737
[ sobs ]

24:46.886 --> 24:48.555
[ inhales ]

25:06.606 --> 25:09.075
[ machines whirring ]

25:24.891 --> 25:25.992
[ sighs ]

25:43.075 --> 25:45.945
[ sobbing ]

26:03.630 --> 26:05.297
[ crying ]

26:20.146 --> 26:22.014

26:50.176 --> 26:52.044
