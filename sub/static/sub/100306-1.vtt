00:43.252 --> 00:45.671
<i>And the doctor told me,</i>

00:45.838 --> 00:49.050
<i>"James, you'll never walk again</i>

00:49.216 --> 00:51.594
<i>in your life."</i>

00:51.761 --> 00:55.347
I said, "Man, get the fuck out of here.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.224
"You're full of shit.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.560
I'm gonna walk."

00:59.727 --> 01:03.689
But... I went to therapy,

01:03.856 --> 01:07.902
and everything I had to do, I did,

01:08.069 --> 01:10.196
to try to walk on my own.

01:11.530 --> 01:15.451
And I'd be damned
if that doctor wasn't right.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.371
I never walked since that day.

01:20.956 --> 01:24.543
And that hurts me by being a quad.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.923
But... life, it is what it is.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.342
Life is wonderful.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.220
Life is beautiful.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.306
I love life.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.266
You can't fool me.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.769
I love... I love everything about life,

01:41.936 --> 01:46.023
even the ducks, the chickens, the rats.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.192
Love... Love conquers all.

01:48.359 --> 01:49.777
That's just my belief.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.571
And when you have love,

01:52.738 --> 01:56.408
you got everything, in my life.

01:57.451 --> 02:02.248
But I went a long time without love.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.375
And I've been the lonely one.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.585
I call myself "the lonely one."

02:07.920 --> 02:10.256
And I say that for a reason,

02:10.422 --> 02:14.552
because have to reach out so hard

02:14.718 --> 02:18.097
to get friends, but they're not right.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.432
And you know they're not right.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.519
And God does not like ugly.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.649
You got to deal with people
that's on your level,

02:28.816 --> 02:30.568
not on their level...

02:32.069 --> 02:33.154
you know.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.306
<i>Grandpa.</i>

03:02.975 --> 03:04.143
<i>Grandpa.</i>

03:05.895 --> 03:09.607
You're going to be late.
You're going to be late.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.489
You have to be on the bus at 7:45.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.839
You're going to be late.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.592
I heard you. Stop yelling.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.638
You have to get on the bus.

03:40.804 --> 03:44.391
<i>We were welcomed by a foreign land</i>

03:46.060 --> 03:52.066
<i>That gave us love, a helping hand</i>

03:52.233 --> 03:56.779
<i>Your native land was ravaged
By a killing spree</i>

03:56.946 --> 04:00.950
<i>And here, everyone is free</i>

04:02.576 --> 04:06.288
<i>- Abandoned us despite her will to live!</i>
- I gotta go.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.250
I gotta go. I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for work.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.127
<i>America!
Your newly found home!</i>

04:12.294 --> 04:14.630
You're gonna be late. Grandpa!

04:14.797 --> 04:16.173
<i>Love!</i>

04:25.224 --> 04:27.893
<i>We were welcomed by a foreign land</i>

04:28.060 --> 04:29.812
<i>That gave us love, a helping hand...</i>

04:35.234 --> 04:37.319
No... No cooking, okay?

04:37.486 --> 04:40.197
No cooking. No cooking.

04:40.990 --> 04:44.034
7:45, Lilya's funeral.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.745
You cannot miss it. Okay?

04:46.912 --> 04:50.332
<i>Abandoned us despite her will to...?</i>

04:50.499 --> 04:51.625
<i>To live.</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:54.086
<i>Fate played a cruel joke on you.</i>

04:56.005 --> 05:00.926
When one loves
a woman, one loves everything about her...

05:01.093 --> 05:05.848
the way she walks,
the way she talks,

05:06.015 --> 05:09.310
the way she laughs,
the way she eats...

05:12.313 --> 05:14.273
Everything.

05:16.859 --> 05:21.280
That was love with Lilya?

05:21.447 --> 05:23.824
Love...

05:32.916 --> 05:34.793
Everything is just beginning...

05:40.924 --> 05:43.469
The van is at 7:45.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.887
Don't be late.

06:18.922 --> 06:20.840
What?

06:21.006 --> 06:23.717
- Now, come on, man, what the fuck?
- Just help me.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.179
You know, now you're gonna make me...
You're gonna make me late now.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.640
- All right, this shirt.
- I need to brush my teeth.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.642
Okay, you got it.
Where are your pants?

06:31.809 --> 06:33.644
The hamper in the closet.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.610
Here's your brush.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.698
Hey, can you hand me that?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.909
Yeah. You know what, fuck it.
We'll wash it later.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.637
We don't have time for you
to brush your teeth now.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.580
- You really gotta do something about this.
- About what?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.250
When was the last time
you used that elliptical?

06:56.417 --> 06:58.460
Fuck off, man. I did weights last night.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.755
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Just help me already.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.384
I'm working on it.
You're gonna make me late for work now.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.760
Let's get your walker.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.055
- All right...
- Help me with these pants.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.391
Yeah, yeah, I got you.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.476
Okay. You good?

07:14.643 --> 07:16.228
Let's go. Let's get you out of here.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.896
- All right.
- Come on.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.877
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin'.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.754
This is ridiculous.
I can't do this for you all the time.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.531
And we are out of here.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.551
You're not gonna head
to the west side today, do you?

07:29.575 --> 07:30.575
I don't know.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.429
You didn't see that shit
on the news last night?

07:32.453 --> 07:34.389
- All right...
- Chirpin', man. They're...

07:34.413 --> 07:38.167
Goddamn it, man.
What, did you take those dumbbells to go?

07:38.333 --> 07:41.253
Hey, man, I just lost 90 pounds
in the hospital, okay?

07:41.420 --> 07:43.630
Come on.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.466
Let's get your hat back on.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.384
- So you look pretty.
- Yeah.

07:48.844 --> 07:49.845
Let's go.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.765
They burned some houses down last night.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.602
- In where?
- The west side, man.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.229
That's all they do
in this country is protest.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.231
Nobody's happy anymore.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.109
They're fucking upset about everything,
you know.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.404
We live in the United States
and they're unhappy.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.948
You know, we live in the land of the free

08:10.115 --> 08:12.302
and they're fucking mad all the time.

08:12.326 --> 08:16.371
People got the most freedom of anywhere.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.957
The police had to call in the SWAT.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.920
Everyone's got some kind
of problem with something.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.172
Nothing, nothing is right.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.383
Everyone's upset, they're fucking mad.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.511
All they want to do is fucking protest.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.181
Fucking protesters,
they're never fucking happy.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.599
I mean, fucking look at me.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.684
I've got things
I could fucking bitch about.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.312
Fucking whine.

08:40.479 --> 08:43.106
I fucking can't walk.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.817
I got to take four shots of insulin a day.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.237
You hear me bitchin' and complainin'? No.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.990
It's just so unrealistic that
these people are so unhappy.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.910
Just live life already.
Stop complaining so fucking much.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.370
I just don't get it, man.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.622
So glad I can't see these people.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.999
- I would be so angry.
- All right...

09:01.166 --> 09:03.252
You know, I've been goin' through
so much shit, man,

09:03.418 --> 09:06.046
since my dad died in '03.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.467
And nothin' but bad luck, man.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.013
No money. My father died.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.183
He had a heart attack.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.602
I got that call
in the middle of the night.

09:21.937 --> 09:26.358
And this was way back in '03,
and broke my heart.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.902
Then I lost my fuckin' eye sight.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.320
Then I broke my leg.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.823
Hi, Vic. How you doin'?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.216
- Heard you're going to in the talent show.
- Yes, I am.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.765
- Know what you're gonna be singin'?
- "Rock Around the Clock."

09:40.789 --> 09:43.250
"I Want to Hold Your Hand"
from The Beatles.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.793
Oh, yeah? I love The Beatles.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.188
- Absolutely killer.
- She was named after The Beatles.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.213
Really?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.382
And her brother was named
after a soap opera.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.550
Really? Which one?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.468
<i>Days of Our Lives.</i> Alex Marshall.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.029
Your boyfriend's gonna be in the show?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.613
Her boyfriend sings like Elvis.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.141
Well, is he gonna help you out
in the talent show?

09:59.308 --> 10:03.061
Uh, I'm gonna see him at the concert.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.564
I don't know. I think
you need a new boyfriend.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.554
I don't know about that.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.199
- How you doing today?
- I'm doing good.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.410
How you doing?

10:18.577 --> 10:20.621
Can't complain.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.040
So, uh, you're a big Elvis fan?

10:23.206 --> 10:27.085
- Yeah. And Michael Jackson.
- Yeah...

10:27.252 --> 10:28.896
It's gonna be out front
with you, Michelle, Okay?

10:28.920 --> 10:29.920
Okay.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.465
Put your seat belt on.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.175
I hate Elvis.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.720
I went to Graceland.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.823
You know what I hate more
than Elvis though?

10:38.847 --> 10:41.224
- Hmm?
- Impersonators.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.810
Why do they spend their whole
life trying to be Elvis

10:43.977 --> 10:46.521
- when... they can't?
- I don't know.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.484
Yeah, I really just,

10:50.651 --> 10:52.944
I just don't like his music and all.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.405
Then you got these people
who dress like him,

10:55.572 --> 10:56.698
try to sound like him.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.201
They devote
their whole life to being Elvis.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.453
I just listen to his music.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.954
I just don't like the guy.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.165
To listen to Elvis,
he just doesn't do it for me.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.877
In high school, there was this guy
that looked like Cliff Clavin.

11:09.044 --> 11:12.631
And I let him know every day
that he looked like Cliff Clavin,

11:12.798 --> 11:15.008
and he called me an asshole.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.095
His dad looks like Cliff Clavin too.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.599
Yeah, my fishes and I go way back.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.769
I came here one time,
and I was in a fit of rage,

11:25.936 --> 11:27.479
and I had... I just had to eat it.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.207
- You're comin' to pick me up, aren't you?
- No.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.311
How am I gonna get home?
I don't have any rides left.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.960
Dude, I don't know.
I'm gonna be at work all day.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.088
You gotta pick me up, all right?
I have no way to get home.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.215
Just give me a call later today
and we'll see what happens.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.133
- Make sure you come get me, man.
<i>- ♪ One o'clock... ♪</i>

11:39.157 --> 11:41.284
Give me a call later
and we'll work something out.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.425
<i>- ♪ Gonna rock around the clock tonight ♪</i>
- Be there in 10 minutes.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.347
Vic, are we gonna be late?

12:04.433 --> 12:05.809
Yeah, I'm... I'm on my way.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.287
Just give me another ten minutes
and I'll be there shortly.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.355
Are we gonna be late for the talent show?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.900
Vic, I can't miss the talent show.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.403
I can't miss it.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.782
You guys are still here?

12:20.949 --> 12:23.660
The van never came. I called it in.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.330
She's all alone there.
Who will bury her? Call them! Call them!

12:27.497 --> 12:29.624
I don't know.
They should be here any minute.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.002
She's at the cemetery
all by herself!

12:32.169 --> 12:33.754
LILYA-#702 - FUNERAL - TODAY

12:33.920 --> 12:35.982
We're better off getting there on foot.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.716
They'll bury us with her if we do.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.223
What floor?

12:45.390 --> 12:46.683
Seven-oh-two.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.226
Lilya.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.900
- You going to the funeral?
- Funeral? What funeral?

12:55.650 --> 12:56.902
Lilya's funeral.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.821
My aunt, 702? Lilya?

12:59.988 --> 13:02.073
Lilya? Man, what funeral?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.534
Yeah, she died like a couple days ago.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.371
But how? We talked like three days ago.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.208
- On the phone.
- I'm sorry.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.919
- What happened, man?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.629
<i>Floor six.</i>

13:15.796 --> 13:17.255
But Lilya's my aunt.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.822
You know you're not supposed
to be cooking by yourself, right?

13:24.846 --> 13:27.046
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I got him.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.727
He came asking
for salt, and got himself locked out.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.522
Do you still need salt?

13:33.688 --> 13:36.817
How many times did I tell you?
You cannot cook without me home.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.151
Look what you did!

13:39.820 --> 13:42.256
They're gonna get you evicted over this.
Where are we gonna live?

13:44.241 --> 13:46.961
They should evict him
before he burns us all down.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.248
It's a little bit burnt, right?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.172
- A little burnt, right?
- Smells good, Grandpa!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.050
It's hot in here.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.055
I need to finish the chicken.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.724
Trust me,
it's finished, Grandpa.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.935
The USSR circus in action!

14:14.688 --> 14:17.607
Let me show you my set.

14:17.774 --> 14:22.028
One! Two! Ten times.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.572
And like this...

14:23.738 --> 14:25.657
Show me this one.

14:25.824 --> 14:30.036
Punch me in the head, come on!
Straight in the face!

14:32.414 --> 14:33.790
The face!

14:38.545 --> 14:42.007
- Good job! You're the best!
- You ain't seen nothing yet!

14:43.800 --> 14:45.176
Watch.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.554
Grandpa, what did you burn?

14:47.721 --> 14:49.472
Whatever...

14:49.639 --> 14:52.058
- Which pair?
- This one.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.895
- Cajun style!
- Yoga!

14:55.061 --> 14:58.023
I sit like this, and not
a single care about anything.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.736
Put your pants on, Grandpa.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.992
Grandpa, come on,
get dressed, we got to go.

15:10.619 --> 15:14.789
- Grandpa, the shirt...
- Got a side dish for the chicken?

15:14.956 --> 15:18.251
Sauerkraut! Awesome!
Damn, you sealed it, Grandpa.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.420
You ain't seen nothing yet.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.632
You're some guy, Grandpa.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.569
- You ain't seen nothing yet!
- One, two, three.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.428
My pants are falling down.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.765
What is this? Baseball bat?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.332
I thought it must be big. You know?

15:33.475 --> 15:36.603
That's his meat
tenderizer slash nut cracker.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.564
Never in my life,
understood this fucking game.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.399
- Pitcher.
- Huh?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.903
Whoo! Throw it.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.571
Up in the air...

15:46.738 --> 15:49.407
Whoo!

15:49.574 --> 15:51.493
My jacket!

15:54.329 --> 15:56.915
- The flowers...
- So cool.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.670
Nice apartment. You both live here?

16:01.836 --> 16:03.672
My poems...

16:03.838 --> 16:08.259
The flowers. Let's go.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.766
You son of a...

16:29.948 --> 16:32.158
I got to go to work, okay?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.911
Vic? Vic?

16:35.078 --> 16:38.623
Vic, please help us.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.583
She's all alone there,
poor thing.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.228
I can't,
I'm already late for work. I got clients.

16:42.252 --> 16:46.506
It's a two-minute ride.
It'll take no time at all.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.359
Like I said, I got clients waiting,
I'm already late for work.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.636
It's only five,
ten minutes.

16:51.803 --> 16:55.932
It's a good deed before God,
it's a mitzvah.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.267
Let's call a cab.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.978
Are you crazy? You see
how many of us there are?

17:00.145 --> 17:01.980
Cabs are cheap here!

17:02.147 --> 17:03.898
Be a mensch, Vic!

17:04.065 --> 17:05.942
We have to bury
my auntie, man.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.737
We are all she has.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.614
David, talk to your grandson.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.324
Victor, you've got to help.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.117
Do it.

17:15.285 --> 17:18.913
Do it the Russian way,
the good way.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.133
"What Russian doesn't like fast driving?"

17:35.638 --> 17:38.141
- Are you coming with us?
- Yep.

17:38.308 --> 17:42.187
- And who are you?
- I'm Lilya's nephew.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.022
Lilya had a nephew?

17:44.189 --> 17:46.691
- You don't see the resemblance?
- No, we don't.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.778
It's 'cause
they had different dads.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.530
A nephew? That's news.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.241
We thought
she had no family.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.703
Big age difference,
my dad and Aunt Lilya.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.040
Different dads, same mother.

18:02.207 --> 18:06.669
Revolutions, wars,
you know how it goes.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.922
My name's Dima, from Brooklyn.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.593
- And what are you doing here?
- Lilya, my aunt.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.723
- So you're coming with us then?
- Yep.

18:20.558 --> 18:23.238
Yeah, I know. I'm on my way.
Ten minutes, tops. I'll be right there.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.289
<i>You're 30 minutes late. How much longer?</i>

18:25.313 --> 18:26.540
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.733
There were shootings here
just last night.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.069
They were setting things
on fire, rioting.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.546
What happened here, man?

18:32.570 --> 18:34.489
This is a black part of town.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.336
How people can live here?

18:36.407 --> 18:38.952
They manage to get by somehow.

18:39.119 --> 18:45.041
- It was on the news... riots.
- Oh, that sucks.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.919
A very bad part of town.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.005
Let's get out of here.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.136
We won't ever bury her
moving at this pace.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.346
Hey, hold it right there.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.200
What the hell are you doing?

19:01.224 --> 19:02.535
- What's going on?
- What does he want?

19:02.559 --> 19:04.479
The road is blocked. There's a protest.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.789
You can't go this way. You're gonna have
to go all the way around.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.941
Why are they protesting?
What do they want?

19:10.108 --> 19:12.110
There's a protest for a shooting.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.695
There were shootings.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.366
Let's get the hell out of here!

19:24.205 --> 19:27.208
- Bro, I need to take a leak.
- Bad timing.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.418
Thank you!

19:30.837 --> 19:32.714
You've got some dope driving skills.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.259
Step on it, step on it!

19:38.136 --> 19:39.554
Fuck.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.848
- Oh, man.
- Fuck!

19:42.015 --> 19:43.375
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

19:46.978 --> 19:48.538
<i>What you trying to do to me?</i>

19:48.563 --> 19:51.774
I'm on my way. I'm... I'm driving.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.694
I'll be there soon.
Ten minutes, five minutes?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.780
- I'm not sure, but soon!
- Vic, how much longer?

19:59.824 --> 20:01.701
Two hours of cruising...

20:01.868 --> 20:03.494
Roads like in Russia!

20:05.955 --> 20:08.416
We're elderly people.
We're tired.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.938
Oh, no, I can't fuckin'
pull over right now.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.299
The roads are blocked off. Please, come
on, I don't need you on my ass.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.260
Just give me ten minutes.
Ten minutes tops.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.102
Where did you find this road?

20:28.269 --> 20:29.812
Attaboy.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.583
<i>Dammit. I'm sick
and tired of calling you. Where are you?</i>

20:32.607 --> 20:34.025
The roads are blocked off.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.589
What do you want me to do?
I'm doing my best here.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.493
<i>I can't cover your back all the time.</i>

20:40.990 --> 20:41.991
I know!

20:50.959 --> 20:52.669
Ms. Holmes?

20:52.835 --> 20:53.836
Tracy Holmes?

20:54.003 --> 20:55.643
I'll get her mom. Okay.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.775
Get it in.
I'm tryin' to get it in. My leg.

20:57.799 --> 20:58.757
Tracy Holmes?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.093
- Yes?
- Your ride's outside.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.446
- You're an hour late.
- The roads are blocked off.

21:02.470 --> 21:03.763
People are protesting.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.532
Are you ready to go?
I got people in the van.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.576
Of course I'm ready to go,
but look what this...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.227
Mom, let me go. Come on, now.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.996
- Clayton! Driver!
- Boys? Push!

21:11.020 --> 21:13.189
- Clayton!
- Just push, okay?

21:13.356 --> 21:14.565
Come on!

21:14.732 --> 21:16.150
Driver, I'm an hour late.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.557
- Damn it! Damn it!
- Stop yelling!

21:18.695 --> 21:21.239
Sis, don't start
with me today. Clayton!

21:21.406 --> 21:23.366
Not right now. Clayton!

21:23.533 --> 21:24.533
You ready to go?

21:24.534 --> 21:27.120
Yes, of course I'm ready to go.
Does it look like I can go?

21:27.287 --> 21:30.415
Clayton, get your ass down here
and help with this mattress!

21:30.581 --> 21:32.821
- What?
- Get down here and help Mom with this.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.235
I've been workin' all night.
Tell Lonnie to do it!

21:35.336 --> 21:37.231
- You don't have a job.
- I'm not doing nothing!

21:37.255 --> 21:39.692
- I've been working all night, man!
- You don't have a job.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.301
Ask Lonnie! Ask Lonnie!

21:41.467 --> 21:43.737
- Lonnie isn't doing anything.
- What you mean?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.805
You don't do nothing all day!
Come help Mom!

21:45.972 --> 21:48.057
What a fucking distraction, man.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.726
I got it, Ma. I got it.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.978
I'm sorry for my language. I'm sorry.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.398
- Driver, go ahead, get it.
- Ma, no. Ma, move.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.401
- Come on. Come on.
- What... What the hell is this?

21:58.568 --> 22:01.446
- I don't want that mattress in my house.
- Ma!

22:01.612 --> 22:03.823
- Oh, no!
- It has plastic on it.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.074
No, I don't care.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.745
I don't want that dirty,
filthy mattress in my house.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.098
- I'm sleepin' on that mattress.
- It's filthy.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.726
- Ma, help him.
- That man was bumpin' and grindin'...

22:13.750 --> 22:16.350
- ...with that naked woman.
- That's why I'm keepin' it, Ma.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.088
I don't have time for y'all.
Y'all gettin' on my last nerve.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.095
- Wait. Wait.
- Hey, hey, hey. What about you on mine?

22:22.175 --> 22:23.885
I got to go, man. I'm sorry.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.155
- Lonnie, get up. You not doin' nothin'.
- No!

22:26.179 --> 22:28.907
- You don't do nothin' no other time!
- Come on, come on.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.308

23:13.393 --> 23:17.146

He wanted his people

- What do you mean, "no"?
- You're gonna make it worse.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.189
It's already bad enough
that it's not working.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.942
I just gotta like reset the joystick
and I should be fine.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.820
Okay, fine. Sure.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.747
Fuck. I need you guys
to get off for a minute.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.375
We don't understand.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.422
I gotta get 'em off for one second.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.631
Have you any idea
what part of town this is?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.387
What are you doing? What's going on?

24:31.554 --> 24:34.199
Uh, I just gotta drop 'em off real quick
on the way to The Eisenhower.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.975
- Drop them off?
- Yeah.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.382
You're dropping them off first?

24:37.477 --> 24:40.563
It's only gonna take five,
ten minutes tops. I promise.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.857
Really, it's only gonna take a minute.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.487
- Will we get to the cemetery?
- We will. I promise.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.032
Damn it. Ah.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.701
- What?
- The sword. The sword! The... The...

24:53.868 --> 24:55.387
What are you talking about? What sword?

24:55.411 --> 24:57.038
The gift. It's a gift I have to take.

24:57.205 --> 25:00.333
I need you to go inside, tell my mom
that I need the gift, the sword.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

25:01.584 --> 25:02.728
All you need to say is "the sword",

25:02.752 --> 25:04.670
she'll know exactly
what you're talking about.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.255
Oh, Vic, thanks!

25:09.509 --> 25:10.676
The sword.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.973
Okay. There it is.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.226
All right, thank you.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.613
- Okay. We good?
- Yes, thank you.

25:30.780 --> 25:31.906
All right, great.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.308
I got to get them off the bus,
and then get you off the bus,

25:41.332 --> 25:43.477
and then get 'em back on,
it's gonna kill too much time.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.461
I have people waiting.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.255
But are they supposed to be on this van?

25:47.421 --> 25:49.382
Nobody. Just gonna
drop 'em off real quick,

25:49.549 --> 25:51.269
and we're gonna head over
to The Eisenhower.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.177
But are they supposed to be on this van?

25:56.931 --> 25:59.684
Hi, I'm calling to report a situation.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.568
He's got a whole bunch of people
on this van right now.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.444
It's fuckin' insane.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.573
And then he had the nerve to say
that he droppin' them off first.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.899
I'm not bullshitting you.
She made me drag her mattress

26:15.992 --> 26:18.077
in and out of the house to get her out.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.321
- Ten minutes tops.
- Get your shit together.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.542
Why the fuck did you do that?

26:24.709 --> 26:28.087
Hey! Hey, what the fuck?
What'd you do that for?

26:28.254 --> 26:29.922
What, are you deaf?

26:30.089 --> 26:33.175
I'm asking you,
why the fuck did you do that?

26:33.342 --> 26:34.862
You know I might lose my job for this.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.780
- Where the hell you goin'?
- It's barricaded.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.484
Your whole damn neighborhood
is barricaded.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.100
- My damn neighborhood?
- Yeah, your damn neighborhood.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.507
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your damn neighborhood!

26:43.603 --> 26:44.895
Why do you think I was late?

26:45.062 --> 26:47.023
Fuckin' sorry-ass,
white-ass excuse.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.816
Oh, yeah, the race card.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.460
The fuckin' race card.
I was waitin' for that one.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.528
I ain't got no fuckin' race card.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.030
You just need to get me to work.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.966
Do you have any idea
how many people depend on me?

26:55.990 --> 26:57.510
You know how many people depend on me?

26:57.617 --> 27:01.037
I depend on you. I depend on you.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.413
So just make a left.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.793
- Whoa!
- Why?

27:13.007 --> 27:16.177
Now we've done it.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.928
Bye-bye, Lilya.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.895
Victor, thank you!
From Lilya! From all of us!

27:20.181 --> 27:21.766
There. Over there. Thank you.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.939
- See what you made me do?
- Me?

27:29.106 --> 27:30.941
Yeah? You're gonna get me fired now.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.420
- Who the fuck is gonna drive you?
- That's not my problem.

27:33.444 --> 27:34.880
I can find somebody else to drive me.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.923
Fucking damn mattress
all day and that's the thanks?

27:36.947 --> 27:37.947
You're crazy!

27:39.200 --> 27:40.910
What the fuck?
You just hit my fuckin' car.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.388
I know, I know. My company's got...
My company has insurance.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.892
- They'll take care of it.
- Fuck that. You got to pay me $500.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.601
- I got to call it in. I got to call it in.
- Put the mic down.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.436
Put the phone down.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.355
- Put the phone down.
- Hey, how's it going, man?

27:51.379 --> 27:53.231
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.233
- Oh! Relax, man!
- I'm talkin' to him.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.218
- No big deal!
- Dima, sit down!

27:57.385 --> 27:59.655
- I have a little bit of cash.
- Don't give him wallet!

28:04.392 --> 28:06.227
- Sit the fuck down.
- This all you got?

28:06.394 --> 28:08.246
- Yeah, I don't have that much money.
- How much on there?

28:08.270 --> 28:09.939
They're all maxed out.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.899
What the fuck,
you buyin' drugs or something?

28:12.066 --> 28:13.442
Naw, no drugs. Music.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.778
- Music?
- Yeah, vinyls.

28:15.945 --> 28:17.822
- Like records?
- Yeah.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.699
Man, my old man got plenty of this shit.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.159
I could... I could...
I could connect you to this.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.329
- Let's go.
- Where?

28:25.496 --> 28:27.140
We're going to the time machine. Let's go.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.559
Oh, relax, man. It's not big deal.

28:29.583 --> 28:32.020
- Here's chicken. Have a bite.
- I don't want no damn chicken.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.404
You don't fuckin' understand.
Relax, I'll take care of this.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.608
- It's between me and... Let's go.
- Listen, listen. Listen, listen.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.527
There's no money in them,
and I can't leave this van.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.945
These people,
they depend on me, all right?

28:39.969 --> 28:42.155
- The ATM machine is right there.
- Listen, my insurance company...

28:42.179 --> 28:44.449
- they'll take care of it.
- The ATM machine's right there.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.992
- No. No, there's no money on it.
- Bruh. Bruh.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.144
Now you told on us, bruh.
Let it go. I'm tellin' you.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.896
I just got fucked in the insurance.
I ain't tryin' to hear that.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.183
Please, I'm telling you.
Just let it go, bruh.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.043
- I'm telling you.
- No, fuck... Fuck that.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.713
- Insurance fucked me already.
- Yeah, well, you're not listening.

28:57.737 --> 28:58.779
Yo, yo, shut up!

28:58.946 --> 29:00.823
Shut up! Let it go!

29:00.990 --> 29:02.825
What did I tell you? Let it go.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.994
They got insurance. You'll be a'ight.

29:05.161 --> 29:07.163
You start this shit,
it's gonna be a problem.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.206
Insurance ain't gonna pay
for my fuckin' car.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.018
You already know what's going on
in the neighborhood? What the fuck, man?

29:12.042 --> 29:14.503
- You better calm down.
- I need... I need my money.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.338
- Back up.
- I want my car fixed today.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.424
Fuck that. My car need
to be paid for right now.

29:18.591 --> 29:21.153
We got to get to where the fuck we got to
go, so you got to back up.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.363
Leave us the alone so we can
get the fuck up out of here!

29:23.387 --> 29:25.181
I need my car fixed.
I need $500 right now.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.667
You keep talkin' that shit,
you gonna be ridin' in this van

29:27.808 --> 29:29.745
- with me, for life.
- Come on, let's go, we gotta go.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.413
Listen, there's no money
on those cards either way.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.899
- Leave us alone!
- And you will know I am the Lord,

29:35.065 --> 29:37.985
when I lay my vengeance upon them!

29:38.152 --> 29:40.446
Sister, cools! Tops! Respect!

29:41.989 --> 29:44.301
- Eat it, loser!
- Back up and let us go!

29:44.325 --> 29:46.202

- Whoa! Whoa!

29:46.368 --> 29:49.538

- What the fuck? Sit the fuck down.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.416
- All right!
- Drive! Drive!

29:52.583 --> 29:54.060
Drive!

29:54.084 --> 29:56.170
- Drive! Drive!
- Get the fuck out of the car!

29:56.337 --> 29:58.005
You wrecked my car!

30:05.888 --> 30:09.058
Strong woman. Respect.

30:09.225 --> 30:10.935
Tops.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.461
<i>What are you doin'?
Did you ever drop 'em off here?</i>

30:19.485 --> 30:21.129
I'm driving.
I'm on my way to The Eisenhower.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.656
- <i>How much longer?</i>
- I should be there in 10.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.325
<i>Hurry up and get your ass here.</i>

30:26.492 --> 30:29.286
She is having a diabetic attack!

30:29.453 --> 30:30.955
Give her something sweet!

30:31.121 --> 30:33.290
- There's candy in her purse!
- She can't find it!

30:33.457 --> 30:36.377
- In her purse!
- She lost it!

30:36.544 --> 30:38.879
She's fading!

30:39.046 --> 30:41.257
Vic, stop! She needs her candy.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.567
- Driver!
- What?

30:42.591 --> 30:43.985
I'm two hours late! We got to go!

30:44.009 --> 30:45.195
What am I supposed to do with them?

30:45.219 --> 30:46.699
Not my problem. These people,

30:46.762 --> 30:48.156
that's why my client is two hours late.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.516
- They'll bury her without us!
- Vic, she's fading.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.203
I didn't ask for them to be here!
Where did they even come from?

30:53.227 --> 30:55.896
Stop this damn march! She's not well!

30:59.275 --> 31:02.361
Give her something sweet!

31:02.528 --> 31:04.697
I know, Steve, I know. I know.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.831
Hello. How are you?

31:15.583 --> 31:19.169
- So what's going on now?
- An emergency. I need to get them off.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.456
What's going on now?

31:20.588 --> 31:22.464
She's not feeling well, so...

31:22.631 --> 31:24.300
So all of 'em got to get off?

31:24.466 --> 31:25.676
Come on.

31:25.843 --> 31:28.220
Michelle, boo, I'm gonna
see you later, okay, girl?

31:28.387 --> 31:31.223
Sorry about this morning.
Who knew this was gonna happen?

31:31.390 --> 31:35.144
I love how the accordion
got off this van before I did,

31:35.311 --> 31:37.646
knowing that I'm supposed
to be getting off here.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.815
But that's cute. That's real cute.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.692
- Sorry, Steve.
- Two minutes.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.903
I didn't know this was going to happen.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.654
I didn't know.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.072
I didn't mean it.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.035
We scheduled this without these people.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.329
Have you ever seen these
people on the van before?

31:53.495 --> 31:55.140
Please know that I still
have to get off here.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.957
Cool beans. Don't even.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.376
As long as I get off of this van,
it's all that matters.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.337
Go ahead. I hope you guys have a good day.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.797
They get to go wherever
they want to go. We're late.

32:06.592 --> 32:07.968
My main man Steve.

32:08.135 --> 32:11.305
Finally the driver does
something right today.

32:11.472 --> 32:14.183
Yeah, Steve. Careful, don't...

32:14.350 --> 32:16.119
Careful, don't rush Steve.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.603
Hey, Steve.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.481
Oh, I know. I know.

32:20.648 --> 32:21.648
I know.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.108
Two hours late, I know.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.527
Don't be mad at me. Don't blame me.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.696
Okay.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.532
But I have a job interview for you today

32:30.699 --> 32:32.242
that I'm gonna take you on, all right?

32:32.409 --> 32:34.578
And I have paperwork for you to fill out.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.247
Right in here.

32:37.414 --> 32:40.709
But because I do have
to go inside for a little bit,

32:40.876 --> 32:42.796
we can fill this out when
we get back, all right?

32:42.962 --> 32:44.380
Does that work for you?

32:44.546 --> 32:45.673
Okay, cool.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.800
What the...? Wait.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.260
Driver! Driver!

32:52.554 --> 32:55.391
Okay. All right.

32:55.557 --> 32:56.642
I'm not gonna get mad.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.818
Hi, this is Tracy Holmes.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.029
I'm calling because I need to request
for a new driver right now.

33:11.115 --> 33:13.659
Well, right now I'm stuck
on 43rd and Woolworth.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.456
Okay, so how long is that gonna take?

33:21.709 --> 33:23.127
45 minutes?

33:25.087 --> 33:28.090
No, that's ridiculous.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.509
Ah!

33:31.343 --> 33:33.262

37:31.750 --> 37:33.293

37:33.460 --> 37:36.100
I got to take Steve to his job interview,
but I'm locked back here.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.649
I need you to help us out, all right?

37:37.673 --> 37:39.525
- So go to the passenger door.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.944
Go to the passenger door. It's unlocked.

37:40.968 --> 37:42.719
- Okay. All right.
- Okay. Thank you.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.640
Oh, thank God, Steve, we got somebody.

37:46.807 --> 37:48.892
Baby, I don't think
I can open these.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.644
Keep trying. Keep trying.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.688
Look up. Happy birthday!

37:54.189 --> 37:56.149
Oh my... You should not have.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.902
Of course. What do you mean?

37:59.069 --> 38:01.029
Look what I got him.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.824
Oh, wow. I...

38:05.867 --> 38:07.119
I love it.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.329
This is a lion too?
This is my favorite animal.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.665
Well, you know, you're my lion.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.168
I was trying to surprise you,
but, you know,

38:15.335 --> 38:16.795
the driver messed that up.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.090
Okay,
so before we forget, I have this box.

38:20.257 --> 38:21.883
I need to take it to your place.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.427
Okay, sure. Why, what's going on?

38:23.593 --> 38:25.804
'Cause of my aunt.
She's gonna be moving into my room

38:25.971 --> 38:27.472
when I move in with you, so...

38:28.724 --> 38:30.350
- Why is your aunt moving?
- Who knows?

38:30.517 --> 38:32.602
She's always got some
personal problems going on.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.604
I ain't got time for her right now.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.858
So I need you to take this, um,
and hold it for me, all right?

38:38.025 --> 38:40.360
Hey, can you hold onto this please?

38:40.527 --> 38:41.903
I can't bring it inside.

38:43.405 --> 38:45.325
- Yeah, I mean...
- I can't bring it back inside.

38:45.407 --> 38:46.950
- Oh, okay.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.661
All right, Steve, be careful,
I'm gonna tuck it right here.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.206
Okay, be careful 'cause it's sharp.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.083
I don't want you to get hurt.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.879
Oh, gosh, Steve.

38:59.046 --> 39:01.316

39:29.868 --> 39:31.995
I'm gonna go get the driver. I'll be back.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.955
All right. Thank you.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.352

41:52.385 --> 41:53.428
But nothing.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.430
They try cut his head.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.557
- Sword breaks.
- Because of Jesus?

41:59.559 --> 42:02.103
Because he believe Jesus.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.314

You understand?

42:13.907 --> 42:15.116
So what happened?

42:16.117 --> 42:17.869

42:18.036 --> 42:19.788
This is really cool deal.

42:19.955 --> 42:21.540

42:28.755 --> 42:30.715
She pray, pray, pray, pray.

42:30.882 --> 42:33.426
In end, Pantaleon says,

42:34.135 --> 42:35.804
"Brothers and sisters,

42:35.971 --> 42:37.472
I'll show you miracle.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.933
Now I'm fucking tired.

42:40.100 --> 42:43.144
Basta. I want... I want to relax."

42:43.311 --> 42:45.272
And he say, "You can kill me.

42:45.438 --> 42:47.440
I don't scare. Go cut my head."

42:48.483 --> 42:50.986
And they cut his head.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.238
Just...

42:53.405 --> 42:54.406
Phew!

42:55.574 --> 42:57.534

You smile, I see you.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.250
You smile. Hollywood smile.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.335
We've got to be with Lilya.

43:07.502 --> 43:08.563
You don't know that.

43:08.587 --> 43:11.131
She's all alone at the cemetery.

43:11.298 --> 43:14.926
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- They'll bury her without us!

43:15.093 --> 43:17.012
I said I'm doing my best!

43:17.178 --> 43:18.805
We need to be with her!

43:18.972 --> 43:22.892
Her life was an endless trial,
and no break in death either.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.419
They're the only way that
we can get to where we have to go.

43:25.562 --> 43:28.440
He just messed up your appointment because
of these people back here.

43:28.607 --> 43:30.275
They're not even supposed to be here.

43:30.442 --> 43:32.736
I know, I know. I go off a lot of times,

43:32.902 --> 43:35.947
but it's only because I know
the kind of position we're in.

43:36.114 --> 43:40.201
- We need to be with her, you understand?
- I know!

43:40.368 --> 43:42.871
Okay, enough! Listen up!

43:43.830 --> 43:45.206
He made me mess up my whole day.

43:45.373 --> 43:49.169

44:09.481 --> 44:12.108
I cannot be on the phone
while I'm behind the wheel.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.616
I can't just get up
in the middle of the day

44:19.741 --> 44:21.344
and leave work, all right?
I just can't do it.

44:27.707 --> 44:29.347
I'm gonna have to get you off real quick.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.169
Get me off? For what?

44:31.336 --> 44:32.936
They're here for the funeral.

44:33.088 --> 44:35.507
I really got to get you off
in order to get them off the bus.

44:35.674 --> 44:37.300
Absolutely not. Not happening.

44:37.467 --> 44:41.721
Please, come on. You'd be
doing me and them a huge favor.

44:41.888 --> 44:43.390
- No.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.183
They... They can't miss this funeral.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.102

44:47.268 --> 44:49.771

This is ridiculous.

45:00.824 --> 45:02.158

45:02.325 --> 45:04.953
I don't want to hear
any more excuses after this shit.

Come on.

45:06.454 --> 45:08.873
Okay, okay. Little bit, little bit.

45:47.537 --> 45:49.622
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.750
Chair can't even take this terrain.

45:53.710 --> 45:54.836
Oh. Oh.

45:55.003 --> 45:56.296
Damn it.

45:56.463 --> 45:58.173
Oh, no.

46:07.807 --> 46:11.060
Look,

46:13.229 --> 46:15.023
We knew this would happen!

46:16.399 --> 46:18.943
Why? You didn't...

46:19.110 --> 46:20.570
What the fuck?

46:21.654 --> 46:24.657
Alone she lived, alone she died.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.159
Can't expect us to wait all day.

46:26.326 --> 46:28.578
They buried her!

46:33.875 --> 46:35.543
No, you keep that.

46:35.710 --> 46:37.545
Set the flowers down, everyone.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.297
Take it, come on.

46:40.882 --> 46:42.509
Excuse me!

46:42.675 --> 46:44.761
Clear a place for the accordion.

46:44.928 --> 46:46.596
Excuse me!

46:46.763 --> 46:49.390
Excuse me! Hello!

46:49.557 --> 46:52.227

46:54.270 --> 46:56.731
- Oh, what happened?
- My chair is broken.

46:56.898 --> 46:59.275
It's not moving. No, my chair broke.

46:59.442 --> 47:00.762
Stop, you're gonna make it worse.

47:00.902 --> 47:02.028
What are you doing?

47:02.195 --> 47:04.447

47:04.614 --> 47:06.454
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

47:06.574 --> 47:08.535
What are you doing? Oh, my gosh.

47:08.701 --> 47:11.162

47:11.329 --> 47:13.456
- Hell no.
- Quickly. Quickly.

47:13.623 --> 47:15.792
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on.

47:15.959 --> 47:17.377
Oh.

47:17.544 --> 47:18.753
Lilya await us.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.564
I don't even know... What is a Lilya?

47:30.431 --> 47:34.519
Lilya was born
in the western part of Belarus.

47:34.686 --> 47:39.148
Her small town had Belarusians,
Ukrainians and Jews,

47:39.315 --> 47:42.652
and they all lived in peace
with each other...

47:42.819 --> 47:47.991
We're freezing.
Enough! Some other time.

47:48.157 --> 47:53.830
Let's remember Lilya
with her favorite song...

47:53.997 --> 47:57.625
a Belarusian resistance song.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.670
She's a war child from Belarus.
This is her song.

48:00.837 --> 48:04.257
I will not sing it!

48:04.424 --> 48:07.552
She loved Russian songs!

48:07.719 --> 48:10.471
Nonsense!

48:10.638 --> 48:13.850
Why can't it be a nice Jewish song?

48:14.017 --> 48:17.395
Quiet, everyone!

48:17.562 --> 48:19.647
Let's not yell.

48:22.275 --> 48:24.485
I said Belarusian! Period!

49:38.393 --> 49:40.478
What is this?

49:44.023 --> 49:45.566
Where's Lilya?

49:46.901 --> 49:48.987
That Lilya?

49:49.153 --> 49:52.113
- Did you dig any other graves today?
- Where's my aunt, guys?

49:52.156 --> 49:53.550
We buried
one other person right there.

49:53.574 --> 49:56.160
Over here, about 30 minutes ago,
and this one here.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.097
Everyone, pick up
your flowers and let's move!

49:58.121 --> 49:59.181
What the hell, guys?

49:59.205 --> 50:01.045
This is not Lilya's grave!
The next one!

50:01.207 --> 50:02.407
Where? Here?

50:02.500 --> 50:05.420
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Right over there.

50:05.586 --> 50:08.923
My legs are in pain!
I'm freezing!

50:10.508 --> 50:12.945
- One more time for my sweet Lilya!
- What are you doing?

50:12.969 --> 50:14.329
This is my aunt.

50:14.387 --> 50:17.640
Everyone,
we're moving to that grave!

50:17.807 --> 50:20.226
Everyone, come back!

50:20.393 --> 50:24.272
Here's the grave! Let's do it!

50:27.358 --> 50:30.987
Let's do one more song
for Aunt Lilya!

50:31.154 --> 50:33.781
Should I read again?

50:33.948 --> 50:35.742
Yes, absolutely! Go!

50:49.005 --> 50:51.966
I won't sing it! She loved...

51:15.615 --> 51:18.618
You know, folks around
here froze like a motherfucker.

51:18.785 --> 51:20.161
Yes, indeed.

51:20.328 --> 51:21.829
Fuckin' Siberia.

51:21.996 --> 51:24.156
- My grandfather's girlfriend.
- Oh, wow.

51:24.248 --> 51:25.559
Oh, thank you.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.852
Well, at least Grandpa still had it.

51:26.876 --> 51:29.378
You better not blow that in my face.

51:29.545 --> 51:33.174
- Help me, please.
- We apologize for the inconvenience.

51:33.341 --> 51:35.551
- What, man?
- We apologize for the inconvenience.

51:35.718 --> 51:38.096
I am too, man. Cool.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.262
- Good luck, guys!
- All right, thanks, guys.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.432
Nice job!

51:41.599 --> 51:43.392
Ooh, fucking Siberia.

51:43.559 --> 51:45.353
Fuckin' Wisconsin.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.105
Ooh. This is cold.

51:48.356 --> 51:49.524
Oh, gosh.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.818
Help me, please. Give me cigarette.

51:51.984 --> 51:54.153
- Cigarette? I can't...
- I got it.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.155
Ooh.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.074
Fucking Siberia.

51:58.241 --> 52:01.119
Why Wisconsin? America very big.

52:01.285 --> 52:02.411
Oh, boy.

52:02.578 --> 52:04.330
She spoke and sang in Yiddish.

52:04.497 --> 52:11.379
Belarusians, Russians, Jews,
and Poles lived in harmony.

52:11.546 --> 52:14.966
Everyone was friends
in that conflict-free zone.

52:15.133 --> 52:17.969
- Now we're getting evicted.
- What is it?

52:18.136 --> 52:20.346
Let's go to
Lilya's apartment. Lilya's!

52:20.513 --> 52:24.308
It would've made her happy.

52:32.108 --> 52:35.027
Hello? How are you?

52:37.613 --> 52:39.365
How can I help you?

52:39.532 --> 52:42.076
Uh, Dima. 702.

52:42.243 --> 52:44.036
Lilya died.

52:44.203 --> 52:45.955
Buried, you know. Um...

52:46.122 --> 52:47.582
We want to sit at table.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.542
Drink, eat, uh,

52:49.709 --> 52:52.461
talk about Lilya after funeral, you know.

52:52.628 --> 52:54.797
In her apartment, her place.

52:54.964 --> 52:56.174
How can I help you?

52:56.340 --> 52:58.134
We have key, and he's going past place,

52:58.301 --> 53:00.779
- but lock on door, you know.
- Yeah, my grandpa burnt...

53:00.803 --> 53:03.097
- the chicken today.
- This is no fire. Just chicken.

53:03.264 --> 53:04.825
Chicken, smoke. This is not fire.

53:04.849 --> 53:06.969
- How can I help you?
- Can you open the door, please?

53:07.059 --> 53:09.812
No, I cannot open the door.
How can I help you?

53:09.979 --> 53:12.190
Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Lilya, my aunt, died.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.692
I'm nephew. You can open the door, please?

53:14.859 --> 53:16.402
- In your apartment?
- No, I cannot.

53:16.569 --> 53:19.113
You'll have to call the manager's office.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.782
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I come from Russia.

53:21.949 --> 53:24.327
This is real far. To be with my aunt.

53:24.493 --> 53:25.493
She died.

53:26.954 --> 53:28.289
My only relative.

53:28.956 --> 53:30.708
I orphan.

53:30.875 --> 53:34.253
I'm sorry about your aunt,
but I cannot help you.

53:34.420 --> 53:36.964
You'll have to call
the manager's office on Monday.

53:39.217 --> 53:40.301
Okay, I understand.

53:40.468 --> 53:43.262
Rules. Rules are rules, I understand.

53:47.225 --> 53:48.392
I understand.

53:50.561 --> 53:51.812
You have nice tat.

53:53.940 --> 53:55.441
- Thanks.
- I have too.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.570
Nice.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.865
Like it? That's my girlfriend.

54:03.032 --> 54:04.784
She break my heart. My first love.

54:04.951 --> 54:06.619
She cheated me, my friend.

54:08.162 --> 54:10.248
Yeah. Best.

54:11.832 --> 54:12.917
What I do now?

54:13.084 --> 54:15.461
Tattoo have. Girlfriend, no.

54:15.628 --> 54:17.088
I have different tat.

54:19.006 --> 54:21.968
- Another girlfriend?
- Worse. Same girlfriend.

54:27.306 --> 54:28.349
Cool. Thank God.

54:28.516 --> 54:29.892
I cannot open the door.

54:30.059 --> 54:32.812
You will have to wait until Monday
when the manager's office open.

54:34.105 --> 54:36.649
Yes, rules are rules.

54:36.816 --> 54:39.694
My best friend, here, walking, night,

54:39.860 --> 54:42.780

54:42.947 --> 54:44.115
He defended his wife.

54:44.282 --> 54:45.616
And knife, like this.

54:45.783 --> 54:47.785
And here, boom, right here.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.495
Yeah. And here, you know.

54:49.662 --> 54:52.707
That's what you guys do in y'all country?
Definitely don't want to go there.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.583
I show you mine, you show me yours?

54:54.750 --> 54:55.835
I don't think so.

54:56.002 --> 54:57.479
Come on, show me yours.

54:57.503 --> 54:58.663
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

54:58.796 --> 55:00.673
- Get off my desk.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.383
I have one beautiful tat on my leg.

55:02.550 --> 55:04.319
- No. Uh, hey, hey.
- Come on, Dima...

55:04.343 --> 55:06.470
- Relax, man.
- Keep your pants on.

55:07.930 --> 55:09.181
And get out of here.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.475
Show me your tat, please.

55:15.771 --> 55:17.541
Mom, I'll take the couch out
before the recital.

55:17.565 --> 55:19.775
I'm getting a second line.
They need me at the office?

55:19.942 --> 55:21.169
What, they want me to come in now?

55:21.193 --> 55:22.903
- Who is "A"?
- Aaron.

55:23.070 --> 55:24.613
- Who is this Aaron?
- My boyfriend.

55:24.780 --> 55:27.033
You have boyfriend?
You together, you happy?

55:27.199 --> 55:30.036
You... Cool life, yeah?

55:30.202 --> 55:32.830
- No.
- What happened?

55:32.997 --> 55:34.832
He was a creep.

55:34.999 --> 55:38.169
I know you.
You and me, we're the same.

55:38.336 --> 55:39.670
I think I feel you.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.797
You're like me, you know?
I really feel you.

55:41.964 --> 55:44.050
- I know you.
- Mm-hmm.

55:47.219 --> 55:48.429
Thank you.

55:50.973 --> 55:52.808
I know you.

57:06.215 --> 57:10.177
<i>The first day I laid my eyes on her,
I knew I loved her. I knew it.</i>

57:10.344 --> 57:12.471
<i>And she felt the same way.</i>

57:12.638 --> 57:15.141
<i>I fell in love at first sight.</i>

57:23.941 --> 57:25.568
<i>I still love her.</i>

57:25.734 --> 57:26.819
I loved her, man.

57:26.986 --> 57:30.281
Love is blind sometimes, okay.

57:30.448 --> 57:32.825
So what made her so special?

57:32.992 --> 57:34.869
It's the way she treated me,

57:35.035 --> 57:36.745
and it's the way she loved me,

57:36.912 --> 57:40.916
and it's the way she took...
the way she cared for me.

57:41.083 --> 57:44.336
And I haven't met
a woman since, until now.

57:45.629 --> 57:47.548
Yeah, you still want this cigarette?

57:47.715 --> 57:49.258
Yeah. Thank you.

57:49.425 --> 57:50.759
You got it, man.

I'm not really, you know.

58:05.191 --> 58:07.359
- I don't really "sing" sing.
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

58:07.526 --> 58:10.696
Kinda like how, you know,
I don't really "walk" walk.

58:10.863 --> 58:14.450
You know?

58:14.617 --> 58:16.137
Just like I don't "drive" drive.

58:16.285 --> 58:17.536
Right, exactly.

58:17.703 --> 58:19.580
Kinda like how you're, like, not on time.

58:19.747 --> 58:21.248
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Exactly.

58:21.415 --> 58:22.791
Yeah, Ma.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.669
I told you I'm on the way.
All right, I'll see you later.

58:25.836 --> 58:28.547
Ma, I can't talk. Can't talk.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

58:28.714 --> 58:32.384
Hey, you remember what
you were sayin' to that guy?

58:32.551 --> 58:35.137
Somethin' about, like, the records?

58:35.304 --> 58:37.389
Were you makin' that up?

58:37.556 --> 58:41.143
- No, not at all.
- You know you can download for free.

58:41.310 --> 58:42.853
I'm well aware that, thank you,

58:43.020 --> 58:46.857
but it's just, it's something
about vinyls, you know.

58:47.024 --> 58:49.109
A certain type of quality.

58:49.276 --> 58:51.529
People nowadays,
they don't, they don't hear it.

58:51.695 --> 58:54.573
- It's almost like their deaf.
- Vinyl? That's like your thing?

58:54.740 --> 58:56.825
That's like what you're into and stuff?

58:56.992 --> 58:59.787
I mean, clearly, 'cause you got a whole
box of it just sittin' here.

58:59.954 --> 59:01.434

59:03.749 --> 59:05.292
You know, I'm movin' out.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.211

59:07.378 --> 59:08.879
Yeah.

59:10.839 --> 59:11.839
That's pretty cool.

I can't even move around.
I ain't movin' no-damn-where.

59:37.491 --> 59:40.536
Just some bullshit at work. Fuck it.

Fuck it.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:23.203
<i>Your grandfather's not
my problem. That's your problem.</i>

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.414
<i>You're supposed to take care
of your grandfather.</i>

01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.684
I don't think you give a fuck about
nobody but yourself.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:28.751
You care about yourself.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:32.046
- That's absolutely not true.
- Give me my fucking key.

01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:39.011
Okay, so when you run late...

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.514
- Quinton!
- Yes?

01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:45.351
He has to take up your slack.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:46.911
Vic has a lot going on
with his grandfather.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:50.522
And I got a lot going on, too.
When that phone rings,

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.900
I have to take up your slack.

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:58.238
How can I take up your slack
when you're out fucking off?

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.032
My problem is to run this company.

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:02.242
My problem is to make sure
that you have a job.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:06.097
If you can't give me what I want, how can
I give you what you want?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:15.297
<i>We are four drivers short
for the disco party pickup.</i>

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.091
<i>Would you like me to cancel it?</i>

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.926
We'll take care of it. Vic!

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:21.553
<i>...grilled feta cheese omelet.
Then they brought me soup.</i>

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.324
<i>- Then they brought me a cheese steak...</i>
- It's your lucky break.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.475
...with fries and onion rings.

01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:28.322
Then they brought me,
like, some more soup.

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:30.688
Some chicken dumplings.
Chicken noodle soup.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.440
They just kept feeding me.
What the fuck took you so long?

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:34.733
They kept bringing me food.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.485
Apple pie, man, with ice cream on it.

01:01:36.652 --> 01:01:37.921
What do you expect's gonna happen?

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.425
I'm never gonna lose weight that way.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:41.573
But then you leave me
in my favorite restaurant.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:46.161
Six fucking hours.
I got a girl, man. You know that?

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:48.789
She's absolutely beautiful.

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:51.625
- How the hell do you know?
- Touched her lips, man.

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:55.629
Touched her lips.
That's how I see in this world.

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:58.048
She changed my luck, man.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.134
Shit, the other day,

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.220
she got me to fucking dance
and I can barely stand up.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.973
<i>You know, I've been going
through so much shit, man,</i>

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.891
<i>since my dad died.</i>

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.561
- What is this? What're you doin'?
- It's ours, man.

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:12.521
What do you mean, ours? What's ours?

01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:14.440
- Try open.
- Open what?

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.233
- What is this?
- It's ours.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.026
Where'd you get this?

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:19.193
It's ours.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.505
I want to know where you got it.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:22.072
My aunt, my money. Open the cabbage.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.239
- What do you mean?
- Try to open the cabbage, man.

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:26.493
- This?
- Open. Try it.

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:28.912
Try it. Try it!

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:33.292
More, try it.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.545
Get up. Get up. Get up.

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.714
- No, no.
- No what?

01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:41.425
- What are you doing?
- Under the bed.

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.469
Up, lift it, lift it! Come on!

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.846
What the fuck are you looking for?

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.182
No, other side. Come on.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.100
Lift it.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.269
She's gonna fall.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:53.479
Higher!

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.285
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:57.107
Keep it up!

01:02:58.025 --> 01:02:59.860
Fucking hurry up!

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.528
Oppa, we got it, man.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:05.699
Come on. Get dressed.
I've got to go to work.

01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:09.244
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:13.040
It's my money. My aunt, my money.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:17.419
It's my money. My aunt, my money.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.087
I only relative, you know?

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:20.756
I don't get it, who get it?

01:03:20.923 --> 01:03:23.091
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who get it?

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.658
- I'm running late for work already.
- Managers.

01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:29.681
- Let's go.
- I give you share, man.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:32.476
- Share of what?
- We split.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:35.312
No.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.522
Hello, my darling.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.732
What do you need from the kitchen?

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:40.317
What? Come on, Grandpa. What?

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:42.212
- Grandpa, come on...
- Good, good.

01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:43.797
All right, let's go. Last one.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:45.548
- Through the... Go.
- Chicken, really?

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.426
Yeah, give me... Give me the chicken.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.285
Mwah.

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:52.621
- So, no luck in love.
- Let's get out of here.

01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:53.988
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:55.433
Y'all not supposed to be in here.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.042
No luck in love today.

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:58.544
Today, no luck in love.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.104
You guys are
not supposed to be here.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.339
Get the hell out of here.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:05.759
Oh, yeah, you're
weak today, motherfucker.

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:21.955
You're really killing me right now, okay?

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:24.069
You just, you have no patience.

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:26.613
You with this...
You with this damn couch, Ma.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.157
Give me ten minutes
and I'll be right there, okay?

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.159
You can't be pressuring me like this...

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:56.143
Dima.

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:05.485
What's going on?

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.908
What are you doing?

01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:13.660
- Dima. Dima.
- Dima.

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:17.414
Always chicken.
It's an obsession.

01:05:18.624 --> 01:05:21.084
- Oh, smoked fish!
- Vic, sit down. Eat something.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.755
I have a recital today.
At least stay for the rehearsal.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:28.550
Talk to me.
I never see you.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:34.681
All I know is that you drive all the time.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:40.228
We came to America 25 years ago.
We did it for our children.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:43.774
My husband died here. His dad.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:46.318
There are two of them,
him and his sister.

01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:49.112
A daughter?
How old is she? Married?

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:53.158
She's a young widow.

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.453
We've been through so much.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.456
Dima, love,
have a positive influence on him.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:02.000
He's 25 and look at
what he does.

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:06.171
His grandpa was a scientist,
his dad a famous conductor.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:08.966
We arrived,
with zero English, nada.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:11.093
Everything is on me.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.971
I've been saving up to help him.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.973
All by myself.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:20.852
We sacrificed everything...
our apartment, our friends, our culture.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:24.815
What did we do all that for?
That was done for his sake.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.609
I never asked you to do anything.
I don't know why you did it.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.324
- Be nice to your mother.
- We got to take the couch.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.202
Sit down and spend quality time
with your mother.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:40.872
We just ate at the wake!
Come on, go, go get the couch.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.791
Wait!

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:47.462
Oy!

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.009
Mom, I...

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.302
When we were in Prague,
my husband bought it.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.469
I'm so sorry.

01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:59.558
We were close to concert.

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:01.601
Must be very expensive.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.813
Like the shards of my life!

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.734
It was such a wonderful concert.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.070
We took a long walk
after the concert.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:15.449
Right around Kafka's home.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:18.035
Such a precious memento.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.580
This is a nightmare!

01:07:21.747 --> 01:07:23.331
Sit down, Dima.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.792
- Driving this van...
- Your daughter, where is she?

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:30.505
She's a nurse. In the black part of town.

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:34.217
Her hands are like his...
musician's hands.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:38.013
Your hands are perfect
for cello.

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:44.978
I was torn between cello
and boxing!

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:50.484
I'm kidding... 37 fights, I dreamed
of the Olympics. I also wanted to box.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.944
Yeah, right,
some boxer you'd make.

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:57.449
He should've been a musician...
it was in his blood.

01:07:57.616 --> 01:08:00.619
<i>- Touch my hand. You see?
- What happened?</i>

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:04.456
<i>- Damaged from too much playing.
- Yeah.</i>

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:08.251
It hurts terribly when I play.
I need surgery.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.755
I've been saving money for you.
What money, Mom?

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:14.925
I want you to go to school.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:17.403
Mom, I'm not going to school.
I'm fine, and I don't need your money.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.822
I never asked you to save any money for
me. Please. I'm begging you.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.307
- I've saved up enough already.
- You shouldn't do that.

01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:26.353
All these savings...
What's the point of it?

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.648
You have no future!

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.691
This is a nightmare!

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:35.112
- This damn recital tonight...
- Mom, I'm done with this!

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.072
Leave me alone, please! I'm begging you!

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.615
Push it!

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:43.078
I want the very best for you.
I want you to be happy!

01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.203
I'm happy!

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:48.082
I'm begging you,
stop driving that van.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:51.086
These poor hands...
I'm doing this all for you.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:55.674
I just want you
to be happy!

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.430
Mom, why is he doing this?

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:06.600
I have a recital tonight, I need space.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.729
He's not a mover.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.524
You're crazy carrying this.
You're five months pregnant.

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:15.193
- Three months.
- Even worse. You're crazy.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.569
Dima, what the fuck?

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.488
- And where am I going to sleep?
- With me, in my bed.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.578
Eva! Eva, please. Eva, please!

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.502
Where is my glasses? My glasses.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.255
Oh, again, I don't know.
Where is my glasses?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.591
My, God. My glasses, my glasses.

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:17.088
Do you have any salt?

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.632
Salt?

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:03.009
Let me, let me, let me, let me.

01:11:20.235 --> 01:11:22.779
So sorry. So sorry.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.614
I'm such a fool.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.494
Salt cabbage.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.918
Take off your clothes.

01:11:58.356 --> 01:11:59.482
Try it on.

01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:15.540
Oh, my God.

01:12:19.461 --> 01:12:20.795
You look great.

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:23.757
So cool.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:25.652
Wait, what are you doing?

01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:28.863
Dima.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.074
- Dima, where you going?
- Mama.

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:32.760
Mama? You can't leave the couch like this.

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:34.828
- This is normal.
- I can't...

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:37.163
People sit down, eats,
eats, drink beer, this is cool.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.557
Not in America. It's not normal.

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:40.959
Pick up the couch.
Don't go inside. Come here.

01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:45.422
Where?

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.507
Just keep going. I'll tell you.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:54.889
Left. Left.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.642
Left! Left!

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:01.980
- How long?
- 10 miles.

01:14:02.147 --> 01:14:03.314
Fuck you.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.984
- Let's leave it here. Enough.
- Keep going!

01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:08.111
It's a good couch. Why get rid of it?

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:14.701
Is this real true,
husband to your sister die?

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:17.078
Yeah.

01:14:19.581 --> 01:14:20.581
Left.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.041
When?

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:26.588
Two months ago.

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.719
- Why?
- Heart attack.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.515
"We are the champions."

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.858
America.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.740
<i>Hey, your got
your sugar mama yet?</i>

01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:54.949
<i>What's up?</i>

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.202
<i>Don't you be late now.</i>

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:58.368
<i>I owe you one.</i>

01:14:58.453 --> 01:15:00.163
<i>You bet your ass you do.</i>

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:09.631
<i>Talk to me.</i>

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:12.091
<i>That's what I'm here for.</i>

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.594
<i>You're just like my son.</i>

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:18.056
<i>I'm talking to you
like I would talk to my son.</i>

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:19.891
<i>'Cause I love you, son.</i>

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:21.643
<i>And you're not even my son.</i>

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:25.104
<i>What, you're one of
the nicest kids I ever met.</i>

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:26.814
<i>You're respectful,</i>

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.274
<i>you're honest,</i>

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:29.734
<i>and you're dependable.</i>

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:32.612
And anything you need to know, you ask me.

01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:37.116
And if I don't know, I'll be
damned if I don't find out.

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:41.371
To tell you. That's what fathers are for.

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:44.874
When I was your age,

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:48.002
I had plenty of ambition.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.046
Why don't you have any?

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:53.383
Not once have you told me,

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:55.218
"I want to do this."

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:58.179
"I want to do that."
"I wanted to be this."

01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:01.349
"I wanted to be that." Why?

01:16:01.516 --> 01:16:04.602
I'm just asking you
a question, man-to-man.

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:07.605
Or father to son.

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:10.483
Like I do my own son.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:13.194
Can you answer that for me?

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.738
I don't know yet. Uh...

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.325
I guess I didn't find my purpose yet.

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:22.287
You know, some things
you just can't explain.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:24.581
It just happens.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.959
And when good things happens,
you got to grab it

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:33.089
with all you got and try
to keep it the best way you can.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:36.801
I'm telling you the facts, not fiction.

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:38.469
What I know.

01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:42.765
I know you're young.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.310
But you're not dumb.

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:46.686
Be yourself.

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:49.063
<i>The most important part about life</i>

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:52.108
<i>is livin'... That's what you know how.</i>

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.651
<i>You got the rest of your life</i>

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:56.404
<i>until you die to be something.</i>

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:58.114
<i>'Cause at the end,</i>

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:01.534
<i>it's gonna wind up
and something, or nothing?</i>

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:03.494
<i>What do you want out of life?</i>

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:04.661
<i>Man-to-man?</i>

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.082
<i>Something or nothing?</i>

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:09.542
<i>Oh, look who it is?</i>

01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:10.710
The runaway!

01:17:10.877 --> 01:17:13.254
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.773
- Ran away, huh?
- Can I come in for a second?

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.775
- I guess you need Trace, huh?
- Yeah.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:18.235
You can have a sleepover.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.486
Look... Look what you did.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:21.447
- Yeah, man, sorry about that.
- Just ran away on me.

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:22.573
I was really in a rush this morning.

01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:24.641
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey!

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.392
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.479
- Sorry to kind of barge in...
- Trace!

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:29.955
- ...and intrude in on your dinner.
- Oh, hi.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.397
- I just have...
- Trace!

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.500
- I need Tracy for a minute.
- Your ride is here!

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:34.918
- Okay.
- I kind of have a surprise for her.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:36.462
- Your ride!
- How about you come join us?

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.529
What? I can't, I'm with
my grandfather right now.

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.424
- Wait. Come here.
- I only want to stop by for a moment.

01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:42.343
- Bring your grandpa in.
- Just put the mattress here.

01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:43.785
I'd like to meet him.

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:45.745
Thank you, guys, for having us.

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:46.972
- It is enough.
- That's enough?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.539
- Enough, yeah.
- All right.

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.726
Sorry about earlier, man, I didn't
mean to leave you hangin' like that.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.835
Man, it's all, it's all right.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.505
- It's just the thing.
- For a first start, it's good.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:57.715
What's going on with the protest?

01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:59.676
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.595
Oh, hey, there's the girl!

01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:04.222
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey.

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:06.909
- They're destroying the city.
- Hi, honey.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:08.327
Why don't you come on in?

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:09.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.771
Actually, I have a little present for you,

01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:14.023
I guess, for my fuck up today.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.377
I borrowed it from a friend, temporarily.

01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:18.027
At least until you get yours fixed.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.030
So at least we can go
to the disco tonight.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:23.366
- Okay. Well, I mean, I guess that works.
- Cool?

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:25.368
- Yeah.
- Cool. All right.

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:28.663
- Um, okay.
- Here, let me help you get to the chair.

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:34.252
All right. Okay.

01:18:34.419 --> 01:18:36.855
Y'all gonna force...
Now you're gonna force me to eat?

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:40.591
You don't want to partake...
You don't want to participate in my life,

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.051
but you want to force me to eat.

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.428
This plate is clean?

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:45.430
What's up, man? Get out here.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:48.933
Where you goin'?

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.102
Um... Buckley.

01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:52.729
Uh... no, you're not.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:53.980
Where you goin'?

01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:55.867
Now you want to sound
interested in my life?

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.168
I'm just sayin', there's a lot of shit
goin' on in the neighborhood.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.872
Why y'all goin' out at this time of night?

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:03.257
I'm going to the studio, I told you that!
Monday through Friday, I go to the studio!

01:19:03.281 --> 01:19:04.866
Since when is the studio a job?

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.392
That is my job. That is my career.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:08.411
- That is my focus.
- Lay off my nephew.

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:10.806
How is it your career,
if you ain't makin' no money?

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.832
I am not makin' no money,
I'm puttin' money.

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.685
- I'm investing.
- Be a star.

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:17.128
- That ain't no job.
- What do you mean, it's not no job?

01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:19.505
- It's not a job.
- Tracy, believe in him.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:23.509
It's your career, but he's
not making any money off of it.

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:26.345
- So how is it a career?
- That's not work.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:28.931
It's like this...
I don't have support from y'all.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.743
- Right? Nope.
- I support you, Nephew.

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:32.703
Oh, you don't have support?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:35.271
You don't have support, but yet
I pay all the bills in here,

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:37.148
and you live under this roof.

01:19:37.315 --> 01:19:39.066
So you have all the support, son.

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:41.235
So you have
the right to tell me that...

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.589
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- I... What you mean?

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:47.575
As long as you live under this roof and
I'm paying these bills, absolutely.

01:19:47.742 --> 01:19:49.011
- Straight like that?
- Yes.

01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:50.846
I thought you would be the one
who would feel me though.

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.830
It's too late for y'all
to be goin' out.

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:55.249
KP, where y'all goin'?
Where y'all goin' tonight?

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.460
And you better keep it 100
with me, you know better.

01:19:57.627 --> 01:19:58.878
You know when he with me,

01:19:59.045 --> 01:20:00.731
you ain't got to worry
about nothing negative.

01:20:00.755 --> 01:20:03.007
We out here sellin' our CDs
and just doing some positive.

01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:05.652
- We came up with somethin' good.
- Y'all tryin' to do something good?

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:06.916
Makin' money the fast way.

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:09.722
The fast way? Of course y'all
makin' money the fast way.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:11.849
Put me on front like that,
in front of the family.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:14.328
Y'all better show me somethin'
or else Clay ain't goin' nowhere.

01:20:14.352 --> 01:20:15.913
- We could show you right now.
- Okay, well, then do it.

01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:18.499
- Superstars.
- Okay. They want to test me.

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:26.781

Yeah, there you... There you go!

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:53.641
See, I told you what kind of music you
was gonna me makin'.

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:55.184
Ma, I'm 18. I'm not 17 no more.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.537
Y'all can go, 'cause y'all
makin' too much noise.

01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:57.663
A'ight, we out of here. Peace.

01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:58.771
- Bye.
- Nice meetin' you.

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:04.235
So mine says, "He who
hurries cannot walk with dignity."

01:21:04.402 --> 01:21:06.122
- That's a good one.
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:07.738
So mine says,

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:10.950
"The one good thing
about repeating your mistakes

01:21:11.117 --> 01:21:13.369
is that you know when to cringe."

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.205
I think that makes sense, right?

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.416
It does. Somebody ought to know.

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.461
"Wisdom comes from experience."

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.171
Hey, hey, hey!

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.400
- Really.
- It sure does.

01:21:26.424 --> 01:21:28.426
I asked you to keep on sittin' down

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:30.595
'cause I want, I want
to tell you a story, okay?

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.347
My kids, they don't know how I am.

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:34.557
They don't understand

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:37.184
why I'm like I am in life.

01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:38.351
They don't.

01:21:38.436 --> 01:21:40.605
And, you know,

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.649
they knew of their father,

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.776
but not long enough,

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.613
and the thing is, is with their dad,

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:51.574
he... he...

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:53.868
He-he... He was, um...

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:56.245
He was a gambler.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:22:00.124
And then after I found out
that he was a gambler...

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:05.588
They don't know.

01:22:05.755 --> 01:22:08.132
And I don't know. Oh, can I tell him?

01:22:08.299 --> 01:22:09.884
Should I tell him?

01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:13.888
I was embarrassed.

01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:15.640
I was so embarrassed.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:19.352
I didn't think they would love me no more.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:20.728
My God...

01:22:20.895 --> 01:22:22.563
I'm so sorry.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:39.872
You know we love you.

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:52.051
"The sure way to predict
the future is to invent it."

01:22:52.218 --> 01:22:53.636
That is the truth.

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:58.015
<i>Oh, Sis, we love you.</i>

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:04.146
- Roll the paper...
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.609
And just grab it right there.

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:10.216
- Grab some tape...
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:10.277 --> 01:23:11.362
On point of tape, and...

01:23:21.205 --> 01:23:22.205
Yeah.

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:26.168
So all you have to do is kind of spin it,

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.295
and I'll try to catch the track.

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:29.714
- Okay.
- So...

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.008
Just spin it like this?

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:33.174
Yeah.

01:23:33.259 --> 01:23:35.011
So let's try to get it goin'.

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:39.932
Whoops.

01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:41.392
Keep it goin', come on.

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:50.109
- Didn't we just fuck up the record?
- Totally.

01:23:50.276 --> 01:23:53.446
All kinds of fuckin' up.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.031
Oh, wait, now my hand in the way.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:56.657
Okay, here we go.

01:23:56.824 --> 01:23:59.994
Here, hold my hand right there.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:17.428
<i>Hey, so, uh,
what's up with the sword?</i>

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:19.513
<i>It's a gift for my boyfriend.</i>

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.224
<i>Why a sword?</i>

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.768
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:27.897
<i>Nice. Very nice.</i>

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:32.526
<i>No. Uh, he collects them, so...</i>

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:35.863
<i>Oh, yeah? He's got a big collection?</i>

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:39.116
<i>Hmm? This is his first one, so...</i>

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:43.120
<i>Does he know he collects them?</i>

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.833
<i>Shit, he does now!</i>

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:53.398
- Oh!
<i>- Da!</i>

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.424
Well, my family cooks chicken.

01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:59.011
I'll help.

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:02.556
Plus, I learned to cook
chicken with my grandma,

01:25:02.723 --> 01:25:05.035
- but not like that.
- Yes, you're right.

01:25:05.059 --> 01:25:09.271
No. You're taking me back to my childhood.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:11.565
It smells like fried chicken.

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:13.984
I wish the children of today

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:17.279
had learned to cook with their parents,

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.049
- their grandparents, and...
- Yes. Yes.

01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:21.575
Yes. Heh.

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.869
They know nothing about cooking.

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:30.936
Children and food.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.921
Children and food, that's what we need.

01:25:34.088 --> 01:25:37.133
- Yes. Yes.
- Oh...

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:07.542
We can't move in together because
you want to try something new?

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.039
I already got boxes packed.

01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:11.083
My family knows I'm movin' in with you.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.002
So what are you talkin' about right now?

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:15.397
- They're not gonna kick you out.
- I can't go back there.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:19.341
Don't you understand that? Look at me.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:20.676
Look at me.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.347
What do you see?

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.413
You can't be playin'
with people like this!

01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:32.789
I want to try something new.
I want to get out.

01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:35.041
This whole thing doesn't even
make sense to me right now!

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:36.275
What are you...?

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:50.247
You are a grown-ass man.

01:26:55.169 --> 01:26:57.213
You're on fire!

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:46.887
Vic? Vic, can you take me home?

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.722
Can you take me home?

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.352
I don't understand
anything that you're saying.

01:27:53.519 --> 01:27:56.230
Mom, calm down. Mom, calm down.

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:59.149
Please. Please. Calm down.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:02.027
Okay. I'm on my... I'm on my way home.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:04.446
I'm on my way home. Bye.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:05.781
<i>Stop!</i>

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:07.449
Stop, driver! Stop!

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:09.135
- Calm down.
- Mom, calm down. Step back.

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:10.470
- Mom, step back!
- Get him out!

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:11.578
Get who out?

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:15.291
Get... Get... Clayton's been locked up.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:16.875
Why you springin' this up on me?

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:18.962
You're bringin' up somethin' on me.
What is this?

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.463
I ain't always bringing jack up on you.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.674
He was out there
with his friends, protesting.

01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:25.694
It's a thousand dollars. It's on you.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:27.904
Why do I have to go get him?
I don't have no thousand dollars!

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:29.305
- I don't either.
- That's on you!

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:32.433
- Why don't you go get him?
- Miss Whoop-Dee-Do that's got her money,

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:34.685
that's gonna be leavin' her family...

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:37.652
- ...that's gonna be leaving us.
- Mom, step back so I can talk to you.

01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:38.999
'Cause you're not makin'
no sense right now.

01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:40.858
You have got to go and get your brother.

01:28:41.025 --> 01:28:43.110
And that's that.

01:28:43.277 --> 01:28:46.238
- Why?
- Because I'm cold.

01:28:46.405 --> 01:28:48.032
What the fuck? Come back over here.

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:50.784
I'm cold and I'm motherfuckin'
sick and tired.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:55.539
Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.067
Ma. Ma.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:28.781
Ma. Ma. Ma.

01:29:31.492 --> 01:29:33.678
I have a friend who's in trouble, Mom.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:34.929
That's all you need to know right now.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:36.872
You need to find $5,000.
Can you do that for me?

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:39.267
- I will do but tell me...
- Can you do that?

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:42.503
- ...what happened? And for whom?
- Mom, I just have a friend in trouble.

01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:44.755
I save it for you.

01:29:44.922 --> 01:29:46.423
I just need to help somebody, okay?

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:48.871
And you need to help me right now.
Can you do that for me?

01:29:48.926 --> 01:29:51.095
Mom, please. Please do that for me.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.471
Please, Mom. Will you just go?

01:29:52.638 --> 01:29:55.432
- Fine, fine. Please.
- But it's a concert. What can we do?

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:57.327
Mom, I really need your help tonight.

01:29:57.351 --> 01:29:58.995
Mom, it's for a friend.

01:29:59.019 --> 01:30:00.747
Just listen to me.
Just trust me. Please.

01:30:00.771 --> 01:30:02.106
Please, I need it right now.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.568
I need it. Really, I have
a friend who's in trouble. I need...

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.335
It's okay.

01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:09.947
It's okay. It's an emergency.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.869
Sasha, please help.

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:18.997
- What is it?
- Can you do the accompaniment?

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:21.125
- I don't want to.
- Please.

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:23.669
We had this conversation before.
I won't play.

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:24.920
Please.

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:26.231
I won't play, Mom.

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:30.342
"Nel Cor Piu Non Mi Sento."

01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:31.635
<i>Grazie.</i>

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:52.716
Where's the money?

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:57.763
- Mom, where is it?
- I think where I put it.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:06.980
Where's the money, Mom?

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:09.399
I put it in couch.

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.444
- What?
- What's up?

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:14.905
Mom, where's the money?

01:32:15.072 --> 01:32:16.490
He wants the money.

01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:20.702
I want to give him,
but we put in the sofa.

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:24.373
What's up?

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:25.700
The money's in the fucking...

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:28.418
- The money's in the couch.
- In the sofa.

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.215
Dima, Dima, Dima, Dima.

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:35.501
- Whoo!
- Dima...

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:37.427
Dima. Dima.

01:32:37.594 --> 01:32:39.555
Dima, listen.

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.032
- Couch, money.
- Listen to me.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:43.100
- What money?
- Tracy's brother is in trouble.

01:32:43.267 --> 01:32:44.768
He needs the money. Can you help me?

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.542
- Do you have any money?
- Of course.

01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:09.751
How much you got?

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:11.420
- How much you need?
- 5K.

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:14.198
No problem, man.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:21.638
Vic...

01:33:23.682 --> 01:33:25.017
Where you going?

01:33:26.059 --> 01:33:27.185
Vic...

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:34.109
Is 1K enough?

01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:35.861
I hope so.

01:33:37.738 --> 01:33:39.990
I drive there every day.
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:33:40.157 --> 01:33:41.366
I work there.

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.577
Nothing's gonna happen, I'm telling you.

01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:52.628
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:55.672
- No, you're not.
- You know I am.

01:33:57.758 --> 01:33:58.758
Fine, suit yourself.

01:33:58.884 --> 01:34:01.094
Vic, we got to go to the station, please.

01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:02.387
We're going.

01:34:11.313 --> 01:34:12.898
Oppa!

01:34:13.065 --> 01:34:15.067
All my favorite people!

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.277
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:34:17.444 --> 01:34:19.404
Rumble in the jungle!

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:22.908
In red corner, Tracy...

01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:26.328
How your last name?
Oh, easy. Easy, partner.

01:34:26.495 --> 01:34:28.580
Funny guy, yeah?

01:34:28.747 --> 01:34:30.582
- How your last name?
- Holmes.

01:34:30.749 --> 01:34:33.085
In the red corner, lady...

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:34.753
Tracy Holmes.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.381
In the blue corner, Victor Funny Guy.

01:34:37.547 --> 01:34:39.257
It's show time.

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:43.804
Ladies and gentlemen, let's go.

01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:47.349
Fight! Whoo! Last, this is for you.

01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:49.518
- You stole it from my mom?
- No, just...

01:34:49.685 --> 01:34:52.604
I borrowed the flowers.
I'll give them back.

01:34:52.771 --> 01:34:53.915
Those are nice flowers.

01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:54.981
- You like it?
- Yes.

01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:57.359
- This is for you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:34:57.526 --> 01:34:59.069
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:59.236 --> 01:35:00.404
Take it. Take it. I show you.

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.323
One, two, three, four, five... 38.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:06.451
I give you one. This is good.

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:08.829
This leaves 37. No?

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:12.124
It's a superstition, you know?
An even number of flowers

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:14.626
in Russia is for the dead only.

01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:18.130
- Oh...
- Why are you so cheap?

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:20.716
- I cheap?
- Yes, you're cheap.

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:22.843
- No, no.
- Yes. Yes.

01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:25.137
- Thank you.
- I not cheap.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.806
I give you one present.
This is for you, too.

01:35:27.973 --> 01:35:31.017
- Come on. Oppa, oppa, oppa.
- Oh, no.

01:35:31.184 --> 01:35:33.687
Cool, cool.

01:35:33.854 --> 01:35:35.105
Today, present.

01:35:35.272 --> 01:35:37.941
I give it, Pantaleon, I give it today.

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:40.485

I give it.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:43.864
Flowers, Pantaleon, money.

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.158
I can give you my best shirt.

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:49.411
- Take it.
- Why?

01:35:49.578 --> 01:35:50.996
Because...

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:53.874
I met you.

01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:59.129
Why you look at me like...?

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:01.965
You jealous?

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:04.009
Why would I be jealous?

01:36:04.176 --> 01:36:06.511
- Vic, are you going the right way?
- Yeah.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:09.014
- Yes. I know you.
- You do?

01:36:09.181 --> 01:36:10.181
Yes.

01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:12.726
I know you very well.

01:36:13.727 --> 01:36:16.772
What do you know about me?

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:19.900
This is place, you know? Animal.

01:36:20.066 --> 01:36:22.569
I feel you. Animal. Soul.

01:36:22.736 --> 01:36:24.863
What, are you some type of mystic?

01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:27.908
No mystic. One guy.
Very small guy. A wise guy.

01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:30.535
He tell me one story.

01:36:30.702 --> 01:36:33.079

I like you.

01:37:12.953 --> 01:37:14.788

01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:30.886
What do you mean?

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:32.732
How long till
we get to the station?

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:35.767
We're on our way. Dima, did you hear me?

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:38.353
I said I know you. Don't fuck with her.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:40.397
She's been through enough.

01:37:40.564 --> 01:37:41.773
Vic...

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.751
You know where

01:37:47.529 --> 01:37:49.322
Vic, do you know
where you're going?

01:37:49.489 --> 01:37:51.157
Don't fuck with her. Yeah, I know.

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:53.410
What... What are you talking about?

01:37:53.577 --> 01:37:55.412
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:37:55.579 --> 01:37:57.539
Vic, just get us there.

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:02.335
What happened with you, man?
What the fuck...

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:04.337
I know exactly who you are.

01:38:06.006 --> 01:38:08.258
Tell me, how are you explaining
to do that again?

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.510
What the fuck your problem, man?

01:38:10.677 --> 01:38:11.803
You are my problem.

01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:13.239
Vic, up there,
you got to make a right.

01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:14.343
Just leave her alone, okay?

01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:16.111
Who you talking to? Who do you think I am?

01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:18.059
How are you even related to Lilya?

01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:20.353
What's Lilya got to do with any of this?

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.039
Where'd you get the dough?

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:25.275
The station's up here.
You got to make this turn.

Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

01:38:27.527 --> 01:38:28.767
Where'd you get the money from?

01:38:28.904 --> 01:38:30.544
You're a fucking scam artist!

01:38:34.993 --> 01:38:37.037

Officer! Officer, excuse me!

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:11.006
Officer, I need to get in there.
My brother's in there.

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:13.317
- I need to get in there.
- You can't come through here.

01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:15.176
What do you mean I can't go through there?

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:19.222
I got to go in there. Officer.
My brother's locked up in there.

01:40:19.389 --> 01:40:21.016
I have his bail. I can go in there.

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:22.868
Can't you see
what's going on out here?

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:25.061
I understand that, but I'm
only here for my brother.

01:40:25.228 --> 01:40:27.272
I promise you. Sir, I have to go in there.

01:40:27.439 --> 01:40:29.039
- No can do.
- I have his bail.

01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:31.192
I have his bail. That is unconstitutional!

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:32.586
Now you're messing with my rights.

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:33.850
You can't come in the building.

01:40:33.903 --> 01:40:35.506
I have every right to go in there.
I have his bail.

What do you mean step back?
Does it look like I can step back?

01:40:56.968 --> 01:40:58.568
You can't get in the building.

Lady, I'm sorry.
