WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.699
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.827
Watch out!
[horn honks]

00:04.963 --> 00:06.669
You seriously
can't feel pain?

00:06.798 --> 00:08.663
- It's called
idiopathic neuropathy.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.336
Chief Wournos, this is...

00:10.469 --> 00:11.675
- Special Agent Audrey Parker.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.215
- This could be why I thought
I recognized you.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.839
- We found that in our
newspaper archives

00:16.975 --> 00:18.385
from 27 years ago.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.259
- All right, I have a theory.
- Surprise.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.556
- There are two different
Havens.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.680
There's the one that's
right beneath the surface,

00:24.816 --> 00:27.193
and then there's one
right underneath that.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.729
- This is a whole new world.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.942
- Did you see anything?
- Yeah.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.903
A big metal ball
crushed my place.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.193
- You like it.
The weirdness.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.862
- I've seen this movie.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.700
- You know, you have
a very rare talent.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.911
You see things
the way they are.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.200
-Cmp

00:41.333 --> 00:42.573
All right,
can we at least agree

00:42.709 --> 00:44.574
that whatever's going on here,
this is not normal?

00:44.711 --> 00:45.700
- Yeah.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.055
[door creaks]

01:18.537 --> 01:20.243
[car alarm chirps]

01:31.133 --> 01:32.964
[engine starts]

01:35.637 --> 01:36.672
- Damn it.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.921
Aahl
[snarling]

01:41.435 --> 01:43.892
[scream echoing]

01:57.743 --> 01:59.108
- Hey!

02:00.996 --> 02:03.408
Hey, what—

02:03.540 --> 02:05.371
Eleanor,
what are you doing?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.786
- Teaching the summer people
where not to park.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.661
- What? It's a perfectly
good parking spot.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.504
- Back in '87, the Gibson girl
got hit by a car.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.374
She couldn't see it,
because the car parked here

02:15.510 --> 02:17.967
blocked the sight line,
so no one parks here now.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.473
- And how exactly
am I supposed to know that?

02:23.685 --> 02:26.893
What about posting a sign?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.512
Gah, why does everything
in this town

02:28.649 --> 02:30.640
have to be
such a huge secret?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.311
- No one'll talk
to you about your mother, huh?

02:36.448 --> 02:39.360
- Apparently, I don't have
the secret password yet.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.903
- Well, you stick out, Audrey.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.151
You gotta learn
to be a local.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.949
For instance, Larissa's
baked goods are too dry.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.413
Rosemary's are better.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.873
[cell phone rings]

02:49.002 --> 02:51.414
Ah, give it 10 or 15 years,
kiddo, you'll be fine.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.333
- Parker.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.832
Hey, where's
the Haven Hunt Club?

03:00.305 --> 03:04.674
[police radio chatter]

03:10.857 --> 03:13.189
So what is this exactly?

03:13.318 --> 03:14.478
I'm picturing
a lot of deer heads

03:14.611 --> 03:15.726
staring down at everyone.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.069
- Yep, except
most of the hunting is guys

03:18.198 --> 03:20.405
using shots of whiskey
to bring down business deals.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.569
It's exclusive.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.192
Well, not that exclusive.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.568
They let my father join.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.615
- You mean the chief?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.157
- I mean my father.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.996
This is his personal life.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.208
- And, uh, it's not yours,
apparently.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.543
- Nope. Not a big fan
of killing for fun.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.878
- All right,
so who's the victim?

03:35.006 --> 03:36.086
- T.R. Holt.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.831
Divorced, old money.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.003
- Whoa!

03:39.136 --> 03:40.592
- Consensus says
it was a wolf attack,

03:40.721 --> 03:42.757
but we'll have to analyze
the fur to make sure.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.754
Probably rabid.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.756
They think it broke
the window to get in.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.269
- But you don't?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.181
- Rabid wolves bite and run.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.598
They don't feed like this.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.724
- But they break into cars,
apparently.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.940
All right, so what,

03:56.069 --> 03:58.526
he used his head
to bash in the window?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.566
I mean, unless
he's as numb as you are,

04:00.699 --> 04:03.065
or he just really,
really wanted to get in.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.070
Something about this
just feels creepy.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.412
- Full moon last night.

04:09.541 --> 04:14.126
- Oh, look at you,
trying to make a werewolf joke.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.790
You know,
you should smile more often.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.537
People will know
when you're joking.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.505
- Probably.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.965
We got a problem.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.130
Manager says that Holt
was arguing

04:23.263 --> 04:25.504
with a guy named Brad Donnelly
when he left last night.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.800
- All right,
and the problem is?

04:26.933 --> 04:29.970
- My father.
They're both friends of his.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.139
- You want to blame this
on Brad Donnelly?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.729
How does that
even begin to make sense?

04:34.858 --> 04:36.098
- Chief, wolves don't just—

04:36.234 --> 04:37.644
- Look, don't be telling me
what they do

04:37.778 --> 04:38.767
or what they don't do.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.485
I'm looking
at what one of 'em did.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.229
That animal's
got to be killed, that's it.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.276
- Before it teaches other wolves
to break into cars?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.524
- We're gonna
organize a hunt.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.820
Put out the call
for volunteers.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.614
You're helping on this.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.328
- Putting dozens of men
in the forest

04:50.457 --> 04:53.119
blasting at everything
that moves is not a good idea.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.333
- You see, that's exactly
where you're wrong.

04:55.462 --> 04:59.125
- If we don't investigate
and something comes out later,

04:59.257 --> 05:02.465
it'll look like you were
covering for your buddies.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.381
- Look, it's gonna take
some time to organize your hunt.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.220
All right?
So just give us the day.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.637
- Okay, take the day.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.135
Nothing else better happen.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.138
[dramatic music]

05:16.274 --> 05:24.272
J‘J‘

05:47.097 --> 05:49.554
- What were TR. and Donnelly
fighting about?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.765
- A woman.
I don't know who.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.225
- Was it the kind of fight
worth killing someone over?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.434
- How would I know?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.179
These guys live
to piss on each other.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.522
Go find Landon, talk to him.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.391
I think he's around here
somewhere.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.768
- Landon Taylor?

06:02.904 --> 06:04.360
Owns the dry cleaners
over on Prince?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.353
- Yeah.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.900
He hangs around here a lot

06:07.033 --> 06:09.115
ever since his wife died
in that fire.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.700
I heard TR. and Donnelly

06:10.829 --> 06:13.787
damn near blew his head off
a couple of days ago,

06:13.915 --> 06:15.155
fighting about something.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.378
- Whenever you're ready,
Landon.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.495
- Pull!

06:24.509 --> 06:26.420
[gunshot]

06:26.553 --> 06:28.134
Didn't lead it enough.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.549
- Oh, no, you led it fine.
Your aim was just low.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.297
- I think I can tell, thanks.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.140
- Okay, if you think so.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.760
- I'm sure you think
you could do better?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.888
- Oh, by better, do you mean
hit the target?

06:39.024 --> 06:40.264
- Here.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.264
School me.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.766
- All right.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.818
Keep 'em coming.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.448
Pull.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.784
[gunshot]

06:52.913 --> 06:54.278
Pull!

06:54.414 --> 06:56.325
[gunshot]

06:56.458 --> 06:57.618
[gunshot]

06:57.751 --> 06:59.332
All right, how many of these
do I need to do?

06:59.461 --> 07:00.792
My shoulder's starting
to get sore.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.958
- I have been to school,
and I have learned.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.126
- Can we go talk
for a minute, Landon?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.465
- You all know
why we're here.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.131
T.R.'s dead.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.424
I want parties to start up
by the Derry Road,

07:12.557 --> 07:14.013
come back
across state land.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.757
We'll drive the sucker
to the sea.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.350
Who's
game?

07:17.479 --> 07:19.015
[men respond positively]

07:19.147 --> 07:20.432
- Excuse me.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.897
Gentlemen,
Mr. Donnelly.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.687
- Detective, you joining in?

07:24.819 --> 07:25.945
- No, sir.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.732
Neither are you.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.445
[men muttering]

07:29.574 --> 07:30.859
I need you all
to stand down.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.734
I know you all want to get
the animal that did this.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.531
That's understandable.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.907
But the chief has asked
that we hold off till tomorrow.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.123
- You saw the car, Wuornos.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.117
What's to investigate?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.040
- Go on, everybody.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.543
Go on.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.714
- Gillespie said
that you had been shot at?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.428
- Yeah? Well...

07:54.557 --> 07:55.683
It's no big deal.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.846
- Getting shot at
is always a big deal.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.844
You were with
TR. and Donnelly, right?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.767
- Yeah, but, uh—
- But...

08:02.899 --> 08:04.184
You don't think
you were the target?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.693
- No.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.434
- All right,
so who was shooting at who?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.316
All right, listen, I don't mean
to cause any trouble here.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.189
ljust—l need to know
what happened.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.285
- Donnelly fired, a bullet hit
a tree right next to me, okay?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.699
Scared me half to death.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.493
- Donnelly shot at T.R.?

08:20.625 --> 08:21.865
- I hate to think so.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.367
Accidents do happen
out there.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.799
- Mr. Donnelly,
we want to talk to you.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.667
- Wait, I've seen you around.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.340
You're that FBI girl,
Parker.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.632
- Oh, keen eyes.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.881
Makes me wonder
how you missed that shot

08:38.018 --> 08:39.724
that you took
at T.R. the other day.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.185
Coincidences make me curious.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.849
- T.R. wasn't shot,
and I didn't shoot him.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.188
There's a coincidence for you.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.567
- But you were
fighting with him.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.399
- TR. and l
were like brothers.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.190
Fought, drank,
raised hell...

08:51.322 --> 08:53.108
like brothers.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.983
Nobody's gonna miss
that poor bastard more than me.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.286
- Donnelly's hiding something.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.879
- Besides his charms?
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.374
But I don't buy
murder by animal.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.422
- Oh, there they are.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.591
- Landon confirmed
that T.R. shot at Donnelly?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.557
- Well, Landon didn't really
know one way or another.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.471
- Just the people
we were looking for.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.391
- Don't have anything,
for you, fellas.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.263
- Unless you want a pastry.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.435
- Are those Larissa's?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.478
- You bet they are.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.852
- Pass.
- You should try Rosemary's.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.819
- Oh, so I've heard.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.234
Hey, uh, can we talk
off the record?

09:36.367 --> 09:37.652
- That sounds exciting.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.323
- He says that when the waiter
offers to pepper his salad.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.162
- What do you guys
know about TR. and Donnelly?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.657
- Apparently, they were
quarrelling over a woman.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.001
- Oh, there's
that Jess Minion woman.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.666
She's some kind of
animal rights and wrongs person.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.380
- The word's "activist,"
Vince.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.420
- She's a witch.
- Got that right.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.804
- They were fighting
over her?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.091
- With maybe, not over.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.931
I mean, everyone at the club
agrees she's a pain in the ass.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.642
- Only if you
like shooting animals.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.806
- Okay, wait, wait.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.270
You're a member of the club,
Dave?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.558
- 35 years.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.522
More likely, uh,
they were fighting

10:10.652 --> 10:13.610
over Brad Donnelly's wife,
Susanna.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.821
- The dead guy had something
with Donnelly's wife?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.486
- That's what people
were saying, anyway.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.825
- It was mostly Dave
saying it.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.946
- Well, even a rumor
of adultery can be enough.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.787
Oh, yeah.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.659
These are awful.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.957
- That's what you've got?

10:32.090 --> 10:33.205
- Yeah.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.504
- If you take the gossip
down at that club serious,

10:36.636 --> 10:37.842
half the town
would be locked up.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.677
- Half the town isn't dead.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.138
- Not yet.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.508
They expedited your lab work.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.554
They just confirmed it
an "unusual event,"

10:48.690 --> 10:50.430
like we didn't
already know that.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.434
- There's gotta be a connection
with Donnelly here, I know it.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.026
- Officer Parker,
you can know it later,

10:55.155 --> 10:56.270
after we get that wolf.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.442
- This wasn't
an ordinary wolf attack.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.781
- This town's scared.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.321
Mayor wants a curfew,

11:02.453 --> 11:04.034
and I am this close
to ordering it,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.620
so unless
there's some real evidence

11:05.748 --> 11:08.535
that you haven't seen fit
to mention...

11:11.754 --> 11:13.881
Let's get it rolling.
The hunt's on.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.642
[wolf growls and snarls]

11:32.775 --> 11:34.151
[bottle shatters]

11:34.277 --> 11:35.141
[Donnelly screaming]

11:35.278 --> 11:36.859
Aah!

11:38.865 --> 11:41.151
[wolf growls]

11:46.706 --> 11:50.198
- Donnelly and TR.
both within 24 hours?

11:50.335 --> 11:51.916
That doesn't just happen.

11:52.045 --> 11:52.909
- Don't get
a lot of wolf attacks

11:53.046 --> 11:54.707
inside people's garages,
either.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.875
- How are you stocked
for silver bullets?

11:57.008 --> 11:57.997
- Funny.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.715
- I'm not sure
that was a joke.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.220
- Full moon was last night.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.586
How many nights
do werewolves get?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.963
- There are rules?
Who says?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.932
- Same guy who says
silver bullets actually work.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.677
- Come on,
let's go talk to his wife.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.431
- We have reports the men
were fighting over a woman.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.943
- You assumed it was me.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.445
But I bet it was
that Jess Minion woman.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.154
She's been hexing us.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.233
You didn't know?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.362
Right there.

12:29.499 --> 12:34.914
She told Brad it was some kind
of Micmac witch mark.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.254
Supposed to say something
to the animals about us.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.589
- Thanks, Susanna.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.298
If we need you,
we'll be in touch.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.337
[cell phone camera clicks]

12:42.470 --> 12:43.801
- Sure, but soon
as probate clears,

12:43.930 --> 12:46.091
I'm moving back to Tallahassee.
- Thanks for your time.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.548
- Okay, I've seen
that mark before

12:48.685 --> 12:49.970
at the Hunt Club.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.515
- You really think
this Jess Minion is a witch?

12:52.647 --> 12:55.013
- What? We were just talking
about werewolves a second ago,

12:55.149 --> 12:57.435
and now witches
are out of bounds?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.399
She's an animal rights
activist,

12:59.529 --> 13:02.020
and I saw this mark at the site
of the two other attacks.

13:02.156 --> 13:05.398
- Witch or not,
she's a person of interest.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.277
- Okay.
So let's be interested.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.998
[thudding]

13:14.127 --> 13:17.619
[truck engine rumbling]

13:24.971 --> 13:26.427
- Took you long enough.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.011
I was expecting you
last night.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.180
- You've been waiting for us?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.180
- T.R. is dead.
He hated me.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.059
Seemed inevitable
you'd show up here.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.322
You're Audrey Parker,
federal agent in exile,

13:43.448 --> 13:46.861
and you are Nathan Wuornos,
detective, son of chief,

13:46.993 --> 13:49.735
and I'm Jess Minion,
suspect du jour.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.236
- You seem to know a lot

13:51.372 --> 13:54.535
for someone who's
only been here for a year.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.998
You're a Quebecer,
aren't you?

13:56.127 --> 13:58.038
- Québécoise, yeah.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.002
You checked up on me too.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.340
This was
my grandmother's farm.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.381
I summered here as a child.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.014
Now it's mine.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.722
- All right,
back to why T.R. hated you...

14:11.851 --> 14:14.888
- I have 90 acres here.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.478
I'm letting it go back
to what it wants to be.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.519
I don't let the club hunt
on it.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.902
- I've heard reports

14:22.028 --> 14:24.064
you've taken a few potshots
at them out there.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.403
- 5:00 in the morning,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.738
how can you tell a banker
from a thief?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.983
Hard enough
in full daylight, right?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.572
- Can you explain this?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.039
- It's a Micmac hieroglyph.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.409
It means offering forgiveness.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.582
- Are you aware that
Brad Donnelly died last night

14:42.715 --> 14:43.921
the same way T.R. did?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.506
By a wolf.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.842
-lguess
they didn't forgive him.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.385
Come with me.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.976
Each of those stones
marks an animal

15:01.109 --> 15:03.771
that's died on this land.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.359
Wounded by guns,

15:05.488 --> 15:08.696
maimed by traps, poisoned.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.989
One step from being stuffed
and put on display.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.782
- Your people
kill animals too.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.452
- We use them.
We don't mock them.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.290
If the spirits
of these animals

15:20.420 --> 15:21.876
come knocking at the doors
of these guys,

15:22.004 --> 15:24.381
looking for revenge,
it's not a crime.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.168
That is justice.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.463
- Ms. Minion, why do people
think that you're a witch?

15:29.595 --> 15:32.132
- Maybe because they don't
like the way I think.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.472
- So you're not a witch.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.976
- What's a witch?

15:36.102 --> 15:39.060
Someone who does magic?

15:39.188 --> 15:41.304
What do you think
the troubles are?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.557
Magic is everywhere here.

15:43.693 --> 15:47.356
It's in the soil,
the water, in us.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.486
You suffer so much
because you can't understand

15:52.618 --> 15:54.779
what's happened to you.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.322
You know it's not
a medical condition,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.572
but you don't want to face
the real truth.

15:58.708 --> 16:02.200
You have been
transformed by magic.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.373
You're not less, Nathan.
You're more.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.548
The only thing wrong
with you is your perspective.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.668
- So where were you
last night around 8:00 pm?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.422
- Relax.
I didn't kill anyone.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.970
If you want to check,
call the AAA.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.343
Had my car towed in Derry.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.560
- Easy enough.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.304
Thanks for your time.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.430
- Anytime.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.658
- I don't believe
she's a witch.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.153
- Whatever she is,
she is interesting.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.873
- Brad Donnelly's death—

16:47.006 --> 16:48.507
- ls still under investigation.

16:48.633 --> 16:49.918
- Guys, we don't
have time for this.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.632
- What do you think
about the reward?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.126
- Reward?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.548
- Club members pitched in
to put a bounty on this wolf.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.012
They're shooting for $10,000.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.176
- Terrible, isn't it?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.719
- Yeah, about time.
People are scared.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.467
- We'll keep you posted.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.397
All right.
Okay, so what do we have?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.688
We have a wolf
inside Donnelly's garage,

17:09.820 --> 17:12.072
but do you buy a wild animal
stalking its prey indoors?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.234
- No, and we have
another broken window.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.857
It's back to human help.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.699
- An animal trainer?
Drugged animals?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.568
But getting in and out
unnoﬁced?

17:19.705 --> 17:20.740
- Tough sell.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.329
- What if it's
not an animal trainer

17:22.458 --> 17:24.665
but more like, uh,

17:24.794 --> 17:26.500
you know,
an animal whisperer?

17:26.629 --> 17:28.210
Somebody who's,
I don't know,

17:28.339 --> 17:30.045
but can make animals do things.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.584
- Like an evil Dr. Dolittle?

17:31.717 --> 17:35.005
- Or, you know,
like a witch.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.092
- Come on.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.758
Jess gave
the easiest alibi to check.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.266
Here.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.555
- Oh, wait, what difference
does it make about the alibi?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.473
I mean, if you can compel
animals to do something,

17:44.605 --> 17:46.470
you don't have to be there
when it happens.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.269
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.437
- Just because you like her,

17:50.570 --> 17:51.810
that doesn't
give her a free pass.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.686
[door creaks]

17:53.823 --> 17:56.030
- Okay, tell me
you got something.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.318
- We have a theory.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.827
- We have nothing.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.703
- Animals are going crazy,

18:02.832 --> 18:08.077
and, somehow, someone
is causing the attacks.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.171
- Nathan's right.
You got nothing.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.460
In the club, one hour.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.333
Oh, bring shotguns.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.141
- Hmml

18:28.274 --> 18:29.855
These really are better.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.191
- Rosemary's are the best.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.106
Zach!

18:36.115 --> 18:37.821
What are you
doing here, bud?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.656
- He woke up lonely
for his daddy.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.276
- Mom.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.153
- He was so worried
about you, though, honey,

18:44.290 --> 18:47.202
going out hunting again after
what happened the other day.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.825
- Mom, he's four.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.497
He's not worried about me.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.540
- Fine.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.378
I don't want you to go.
That better?

18:53.507 --> 18:55.122
- Well, at least
you're being honest.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.045
- So come on home
with us, please.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.544
Okay, let's just go outside.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.888
- It's us three
with the chief.

19:03.017 --> 19:06.009
- This is gonna be fun.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.430
- Oh, yeah.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.600
All kinds of fun.

19:15.946 --> 19:21.191
[distant gunshots]

19:21.327 --> 19:24.535
- They're gonna be blasting
at their shadows all day.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.029
- Where's Vince?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.871
- He doesn't hunt.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.662
He loves all creatures
great and small, he says,

19:30.795 --> 19:32.501
usually with fries.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.047
- Hold up.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.335
This is the back end
of the Minion farm.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.837
It's posted,
we can't go in.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.713
- Ever hear of hot pursuit?

19:44.850 --> 19:47.557
- Hey, this direction isn't
any more likely than another.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.767
- Or any less.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.432
Look, this is all part
of our area to sweep.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.724
We're going in. Let's go.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.643
- This is a bad idea.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.948
- Starting to look
like my definition

20:03.077 --> 20:04.567
of a good day's hunting.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.944
- What?

20:06.080 --> 20:08.867
- We're gonna eat lunch
before anything lunches on us.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.408
[growling]

20:12.545 --> 20:14.035
Whoa.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.341
[growling]

20:24.473 --> 20:25.553
- No!
[gunshot]

20:27.226 --> 20:28.215
- What the hell are you doing?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.593
- That was a dog!

20:30.730 --> 20:31.765
- I don't think you hit it.

20:31.897 --> 20:32.932
- Of course not.
You hit my gun!

20:33.065 --> 20:34.145
- Yeah, I hit your gun!

20:34.275 --> 20:35.435
It was Jess Minion's pet!

20:35.568 --> 20:37.934
[grunting]

20:38.070 --> 20:39.446
- Oooh!
- Oh!

20:39.572 --> 20:41.028
[moose grunting]

20:45.202 --> 20:48.319
[gunshots,
moose bellowing]

21:04.889 --> 21:05.878
- What the...

21:06.015 --> 21:08.301
That's stuffed
with rags and sand.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.059
- Dave, are you all right?

21:16.192 --> 21:18.433
What's that?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.042
- So much
for the werewolf theory.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.502
- Yeah,
we have real evidence now,

21:38.631 --> 21:41.043
but I have no idea
what to do with this.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.167
- Dave's
gotta get checked out.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.588
We gotta get him
out of here, okay?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.461
- Okay. What do you
want us to do with this?

21:47.598 --> 21:48.633
- Let me worry about this.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.347
What I want you two
is get out of here

21:50.476 --> 21:51.556
and just stop this nonsense.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.186
- Nonsense?
Like this hunt?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.518
- You think this
plays out better

21:54.647 --> 21:55.978
in the middle
of Main Street, Nathan?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.016
Is that what you think?

21:57.149 --> 21:58.480
Would you just
go get Teagues for me

21:58.609 --> 21:59.598
like I asked you?
Thanks.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.106
Like now.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.021
- Oh, nice.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.898
You know
he saved your life, right?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.866
- Who do you think's
been dealing with all this

22:09.995 --> 22:11.701
before you graced us
with your presence?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.947
Who do you think's gonna be
dealing with it after I'm gone?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.415
I wanted you in this job
because you had a knack

22:16.544 --> 22:17.750
with dealing
with all this crap.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.494
I'm just praying to God
some of it rubs off on him.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.542
- You know what, he's a lot
better at this than you think.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.881
- Well, I tell you what,
Agent Parker.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.920
This is a lot worse
than what you think.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.547
How you doin', Dave?
- That's a weird-looking moose.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.389
- Oh, man.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.097
You look kind of—
- Perfect.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.390
- Yeah, perfect.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.512
Let's get you home.

22:38.649 --> 22:39.980
- All right,
we need to go talk to Jess.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.645
- I know.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.109
- Jess being sympathetic
to your problem,

22:44.238 --> 22:46.229
it makes a lot more sense
if she's troubled too.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.357
- Well, if she is,
how do we stop it?

22:49.493 --> 22:53.702
- If she is,
does she want it to be stopped?

22:59.795 --> 23:02.036
[dog barking]

23:02.172 --> 23:04.037
[distant gunshots]

23:04.174 --> 23:05.084
- You hear that?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.458
Are you guys happy now?

23:07.595 --> 23:08.755
- Believe it or not,

23:08.888 --> 23:10.253
it's not my favorite sound,
either, all right?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.549
But we don't have time
for this.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.218
- We've had
three animal attacks.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.011
At least one of them
was stuffed.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.305
- Stuffed?

23:17.438 --> 23:18.894
You're joking, right?

23:19.023 --> 23:21.184
- Both of us were almost killed
by one of these things.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.774
- I'm sorry
that happened, Nathan,

23:23.903 --> 23:25.018
but I cannot help you.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.269
- Jess, if you're troubled,

23:26.405 --> 23:27.986
you might not even
be aware you're doing it.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.571
You might just think
it's part of

23:29.700 --> 23:31.656
whatever rituals you're doing.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.777
- Nathan,

23:34.914 --> 23:37.951
I'm not doing any rituals.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.246
I'm not a witch or a shaman
or anything like that.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.289
The only Micmac
was my mother's mother,

23:43.422 --> 23:45.083
and she was a half-blood.

23:45.215 --> 23:49.299
Most of what I know
is just. . .stories,

23:49.428 --> 23:50.964
third-hand legends.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.472
- The hieroglyph?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.134
- Wikipedia.

23:55.726 --> 23:59.139
I'm not troubled, Nathan.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.886
I'm just...
I'm just me.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.974
If I had any kind of power,
Officer Parker,

24:05.110 --> 24:07.726
those animals never would have
died in the first place.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.900
- All right, thanks.
I think we're done here.

24:13.452 --> 24:18.196
- Nathan, everything I said
about you is still true.

24:26.757 --> 24:27.997
- No werewolf

24:28.133 --> 24:29.293
and no witch.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.293
- How about some old-fashioned
physical evidence?

24:42.106 --> 24:44.222
- Taste.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.019
The final frontier.

24:52.366 --> 24:53.822
- Look.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.329
- Oh, man.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.997
We're gonna
need some help.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.430
- [chuckles]

25:15.556 --> 25:17.387
Well, at least clean-up
will be easy.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.926
The rags will
wipe up the sand.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.390
- [sniffs]

25:20.519 --> 25:22.134
Something smells off.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.011
- Might be this.

25:25.107 --> 25:28.895
Wolfie had a bedtime snack.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.313
Could be a match for T.R.'s.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.026
Well, you want to fill me in
on everything?

25:35.159 --> 25:37.775
Or are my services
no longer required?

25:37.911 --> 25:39.822
- No, I think we have it
from here, thank you.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.616
- Yeah, you keep
telling yourselves that.

25:41.749 --> 25:45.833
Doesn't have to be true
to make you feel better.

25:45.961 --> 25:46.996
Good luck.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.297
- What don't you want
her to know?

25:52.426 --> 25:54.337
- You know the moose
that attacked your dad?

25:54.470 --> 25:57.553
This plaque says that
he shot one up in Arrow—

25:57.681 --> 25:58.670
- Aroostook.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.513
Two years ago?
- Uh-huh.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.178
- You think that was
the same one?

26:02.311 --> 26:03.801
- Do you see a moose?

26:06.607 --> 26:08.768
Wolfie over there,
shot by Donnelly.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.812
This one by TR. Holt.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.105
The animals
are coming alive

26:13.238 --> 26:14.944
and killing the people
who killed them.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.407
- And then they
just go back to being stuffed?

26:18.535 --> 26:21.572
- See this? I found this
on wolfie over there.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.661
All of them have them.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.291
- C.L.-6?
What does that mean?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.000
- I don't know
what it means,

26:29.129 --> 26:31.745
but between the plaques
and the tags,

26:31.882 --> 26:33.167
we have a timeline.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.666
And the most recently killed
is coming alive first.

26:35.803 --> 26:39.637
- There's
some animals missing.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.552
- All right,
so the first question is,

26:42.684 --> 26:44.140
what's bringing them back?

26:44.269 --> 26:45.520
- No.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.479
First one is,
where's the bear?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.438
- Who killed it?

26:59.368 --> 27:00.574
[growling]

27:00.702 --> 27:02.408
- Vince, would you just take

27:02.538 --> 27:05.029
your damn
allergy medicine already?

27:05.165 --> 27:10.455
No one cares
if it makes you feel slow.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.999
No one would notice anyway.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.542
[growling]

27:14.675 --> 27:17.291
Vincent!

27:17.427 --> 27:19.918
- What?
Do you need something?

27:20.055 --> 27:21.556
[roars]

27:21.682 --> 27:23.798
- Oh!

27:24.852 --> 27:28.015
Get me out of here!
Vincent!

27:41.618 --> 27:42.733
[bear growling]
- Help!

27:42.870 --> 27:45.031
Help! Help me! Help!

27:45.164 --> 27:47.576
Somebody help.
Please call the police!

27:47.708 --> 27:49.289
- Help!

27:50.544 --> 27:52.910
[bear growling]

27:53.046 --> 27:54.786
- Yep.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.387
It took both of our shotguns
to blow the head off that moose.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.425
These things are useless.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.718
- Ideas?

28:08.645 --> 28:19.567
- Yeah,
let's turn up the heat.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.654
- Fire in the hole!

28:21.783 --> 28:23.819
[bear growls]

28:23.952 --> 28:25.738
Those are better
than silver bullets.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.790
- That was damndest thing
I've seen in ages!

28:34.922 --> 28:36.628
- You can be a little less
thrilled, Vince.

28:36.757 --> 28:37.792
It almost killed me.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.085
- I know!

28:39.218 --> 28:40.879
- All right, I know
that you guys are excited,

28:41.011 --> 28:42.091
but we really
need to discuss

28:42.221 --> 28:44.758
how you're gonna
write about this.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.755
- You're worried
how it'll look in The Herald?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.473
- Does it have
to look like anything?

28:48.602 --> 28:51.264
- What do you think
it's gonna look like, Dave?

28:51.396 --> 28:52.772
Uh, rabies?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.104
- Right time of year.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.348
- Oh, don't worry.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.690
We'll think
of something, dear.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.194
We always do.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.278
- Uh, hey,
do you guys, uh...

29:01.406 --> 29:03.271
do you recognize this?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.785
It came off the animal
that attacked T.R.

29:05.911 --> 29:06.821
- Maker's mark.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.320
My bear had one
just like it.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.696
"C.L.- 6."

29:10.832 --> 29:12.697
- Initials?

29:12.834 --> 29:16.122
"Canis lupus number six"
is my bet.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.665
Probably means
it's the sixth wolf

29:17.798 --> 29:19.709
that Landon Taylor stuffed.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.502
I recognize his mark.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.966
- Landon?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.428
- Hey, Landon?

29:31.561 --> 29:33.893
[bell dings]

29:34.022 --> 29:34.977
- I'm back here,

29:35.107 --> 29:36.347
cleaning up this mess.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.939
- Looks like another attack.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.814
What happened?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.312
- I just came in
and found this.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.609
Do you think this was
one of those rabid animals?

29:47.995 --> 29:49.826
- The animals aren't rabid.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.695
- You've heard about
the troubles, haven't you?

29:51.832 --> 29:53.538
- The troubles.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.328
- We found this
inside an animal

29:55.460 --> 29:57.792
that was killed
while attacking someone.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.423
- Recognize this?

30:00.549 --> 30:03.211
- All the attacking animals
are stuffed...

30:03.343 --> 30:04.753
by you.

30:06.388 --> 30:09.175
- This is, uh...

30:09.308 --> 30:11.344
this is ours.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.013
- It came from the moose
the chief killed two years ago.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.182
- The animals are killing
the people who killed them,

30:16.315 --> 30:19.682
and yours must be
coming after you too.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.651
- If that's true,

30:22.779 --> 30:24.280
they'd all have to be destroyed.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.776
I have to end this.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.991
- What are you doing here?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.076
- We just came
for Landon's help.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.411
- Stay away from my son.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.495
You're making a mistake.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.704
He has nothing
to do with this.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.199
- Mom, stop.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.542
- Landon, get in the car.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.410
Go!

30:40.547 --> 30:41.536
Go.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.913
- I just need to—
- Piper, don't!

30:43.050 --> 30:45.211
- Ma'am.
Down. Down.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.551
Let go. Drop it.
Drop it.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.759
- Ah!

30:48.889 --> 30:51.130
- Landon, your arm.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.055
- How...?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.520
- Let me go!
He needs me!

30:58.648 --> 31:00.559
- No, Landon, wait!

31:00.692 --> 31:02.353
Landon, stop!

31:03.362 --> 31:05.694
He didn't stuff himself.

31:05.822 --> 31:06.732
He's not the cause
of this.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.231
- It's my fault.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.448
It's all my fault.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.408
- He said he wanted to destroy
all the animals.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.743
- He can't do that.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.736
- Why?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.738
- I can feel them.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.740
They're all waking up.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.002
- But I thought Landon was
the taxidermist.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.125
- He was.
I never sewed them.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.798
ljust gave him
some of my sewing rags.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.796
l—l had no idea
that would be enough to...

31:32.933 --> 31:34.298
- To bring them back?

31:34.434 --> 31:36.140
- When I found him
in the fire,

31:36.269 --> 31:38.305
his wife was burned.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.769
l—l couldn't save her.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.229
But Lanny wasn't.

31:41.358 --> 31:44.100
He must have
just suffocated.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.898
He looked
like he was still alive.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.489
I couldn't help myself.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.199
I just—l just couldn't
help myself.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.286
- So you said that you could
feel them waking up?

31:56.415 --> 31:59.202
- When Landon came back,
I felt it.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.950
But then everything was fine
until...

32:02.087 --> 32:04.043
he almost got shot
the other day.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.788
And this feeling,
it just kept getting

32:06.925 --> 32:08.290
stronger and stronger.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.883
- Well, from what I've seen,
the stress,

32:10.011 --> 32:11.296
it makes these things worse.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.921
- My father wanted me
to be careful.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.265
I thought I was.

32:18.687 --> 32:22.430
All I ever wanted to do
was to keep him safe.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.621
- Landon, stop!

32:48.758 --> 32:50.259
- Piper, stay here.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.465
- He's my son.

33:01.688 --> 33:05.522
- Easy. guys,
we're on your side.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.311
- Speak for yourself.

33:11.031 --> 33:12.646
[lock clicks]

33:12.782 --> 33:15.524
[low growling]

33:15.660 --> 33:17.776
- Landon?

33:17.913 --> 33:18.777
Damn it.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.825
We gotta hurry.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.171
- I'm sorry,
but I made you,

33:30.300 --> 33:31.540
and I have to stop you.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.587
- Landon, get out of there!

33:33.720 --> 33:35.676
The animals you killed
are waking up!

33:35.805 --> 33:38.842
- They're coming for you!

33:38.975 --> 33:40.385
- Landon!
Landon, stop.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.849
- Mom! Open up!

33:44.981 --> 33:47.688
We have to kill them!

33:47.817 --> 33:48.897
- Piper!

33:49.027 --> 33:49.982
[pounding at door]

33:50.111 --> 33:51.066
- This is my fault.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.231
I started this!

33:52.364 --> 33:53.729
- Piper!

33:53.865 --> 33:55.241
- Piper!
- Mom!

33:55.367 --> 33:58.029
- If they kill me, they stop
and won't come after you!

33:58.161 --> 34:00.072
Now go!

34:00.205 --> 34:03.368
Mom, get out of there!

34:03.500 --> 34:05.411
- It ends with me.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.081
[lion growling]

34:08.213 --> 34:12.206
[snarling and roaring]

34:19.933 --> 34:22.140
[Piper screams]

35:01.600 --> 35:03.136
- [sighs]

35:09.774 --> 35:11.685
- They killed
three wolves today.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.774
God knows what else.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.313
- Is the rabies story
sticking?

35:15.447 --> 35:17.062
- Not sure I care.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.814
One way or another, we'll make
everyone think it's all right.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.157
- It is, Nathan.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.494
It's better, anyway.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.329
I think it was the fire
that caused

35:26.458 --> 35:29.666
Piper's condition
to flare up,

35:29.794 --> 35:32.501
and then she, uh,
revived Landon.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.838
So when Landon
was almost shot...

35:34.966 --> 35:37.799
- Her condition
went into overdrive.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.339
- So what are
we gonna tell him?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.053
- The truth.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.073
I'm sorry about
what happened to your mother.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.190
- We're destroying
all the animals

36:01.326 --> 36:04.033
that your mom brought back
just to be safe.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.527
- Except for me.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.575
Or did you change
your minds about that?

36:10.085 --> 36:13.373
- Landon, this doesn't
have to be so bad.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.416
You still have Zach
to live for.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.254
- Is that what I'm doing?

36:17.384 --> 36:18.749
Living?

36:18.885 --> 36:22.753
I'm not even real,
Officer Parker.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.138
- Nathan.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.562
- I can't feel that.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.811
You and I have
a lot in common.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.277
We're different,
but you know what?

36:43.410 --> 36:46.197
Doesn't make us
any less than anyone else.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.538
In some ways,
maybe it makes us even more.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.374
You've been this way
for how long?

36:53.503 --> 36:56.245
Six months?

36:56.381 --> 36:59.123
Were you any less
a father to him?

36:59.259 --> 37:00.874
Did he even notice?

37:01.010 --> 37:02.875
- No.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.593
- That's right.

37:04.723 --> 37:08.432
'Cause you're
more than this.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.677
Maybe even a little magic.

37:14.274 --> 37:15.889
- Maybe that's true.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.780
Come here, buddy.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.247
This way.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.576
- Do you really believe that,

37:36.713 --> 37:38.453
that you're magic?

37:38.590 --> 37:41.047
- [scoffs] Not quite.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.792
- Well, you just saved
that man's life.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.590
It may not be magic,
but it sure is close.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.543
- What now?

38:22.675 --> 38:24.336
Did someone else die?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.050
- Actually, yes.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.806
That's not why I'm here.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.052
I came to say I'm sorry.

38:34.437 --> 38:37.804
You're
sorry?

38:37.941 --> 38:39.681
- What you said was true.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.767
I don't know...

38:42.904 --> 38:44.485
I don't know about magic,

38:44.614 --> 38:48.323
but I'm
definitely something...

38:48.451 --> 38:49.486
different.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.197
Or I could be.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.501
- I kind of like you
the way you are.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.342
- Um...
[clears throat]

39:12.517 --> 39:16.351
Do you want
to get some pancakes?

39:16.479 --> 39:18.435
- I don't like pancakes.

39:18.565 --> 39:21.352
But I'd love to have
breakfast with you.

39:28.408 --> 39:29.773
[taps on door]

39:29.909 --> 39:31.490
- You wanted to see me,
kiddo?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.155
- Hey, thanks for coming.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.654
Listen, there's a lot going
on around here

39:35.790 --> 39:36.870
that nobody is telling me,

39:37.000 --> 39:41.585
and for some reason...

39:41.713 --> 39:43.169
I trust you, Eleanor.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.710
- That's your first mistake.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.629
- You did the ME. report,
right?

39:48.761 --> 39:50.752
You saw what I saw.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.881
You saw what
was left of Piper.

39:54.017 --> 39:57.009
- I saw a lot of rags
thrown around the room.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.931
- Exactly.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.681
- And that's what's going
into your report too, isn't it?

40:02.817 --> 40:03.932
- Sure.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.059
'Cause that's what
goes in a report, right?

40:11.075 --> 40:14.112
Piper was stuffed,

40:14.245 --> 40:15.621
and then she stuffed
her son.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.989
It must have been going on
for generations,

40:19.125 --> 40:20.535
and ljust—

40:22.211 --> 40:26.124
I just—
I couldn't write that down.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.794
- I'm guessing you didn't tell
Landon the truth, either.

40:28.927 --> 40:32.260
- No.

40:32.388 --> 40:36.131
I thought if something awful
happened to his boy that...

40:36.267 --> 40:40.306
Well, if he knew,
then he would be tempted

40:40.438 --> 40:41.644
to stuff him too.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.685
But l—l just don't feel
right about this.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.278
This is just another secret
that's gonna play itself out

40:51.407 --> 40:52.988
all over again.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.285
- You do what you can...

40:59.832 --> 41:01.697
And the world goes on.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.291
Here.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.331
This'll make you
feel better.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.095
- Is that Rosemary's?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.301
- Yeah.

41:18.935 --> 41:20.516
I'm gonna do what I can

41:20.645 --> 41:22.681
to help you find out
about your mum.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.181
- Wait, you would do that?

41:27.318 --> 41:31.311
- Well, we gotta
stick together up here.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.904
You're not a summer person
anymore, kid.
