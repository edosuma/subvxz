WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.034
AW, REMEMBER LAST YEAR'S
4th OF JULY BARBECUE?

00:03.034 --> 00:04.335
LOOK, THERE'S BOBBY
LIGHTING FIREWORKS.

00:04.335 --> 00:05.336
MM.

00:05.336 --> 00:07.308
THERE'S BOBBY ON FIRE.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.010
THERE'S YOU LAUGHING
AT BOBBY ON FIRE.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.382
I LOVE THAT PICTURE OF ME.

00:11.382 --> 00:14.315
(camera beeping)
THESE PICTURES SKIP
FROM LABOR DAY TO NEW YEAR'S.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.217
HOW DID WE MISS THANKSGIVING?

00:16.217 --> 00:20.151
REMEMBER, OUR SCHEDULES GOT
ALL MIXED UP?

00:20.151 --> 00:22.053
WE ALL WENT AWAY,
AND NONE OF US REALLY KNEW

00:22.053 --> 00:23.324
WHEN WE WERE COMING BACK.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.257
GUESS WHAT? TOMORROW
WE CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING.

00:26.257 --> 00:30.361
ORWE CELEBRATE
THANKSGIVING IN THE FALL.

00:30.361 --> 00:32.233
WHAT IF WE'RE NOT AROUND
NEXT FALL?

00:32.233 --> 00:34.235
WHAT IF A NEW GROUP COMES IN
AND REPLACES US?

00:34.235 --> 00:36.067
OH.
EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE LIKE,

00:36.067 --> 00:37.408
"WHAT HAPPENED
"TO THE CUL-DE-SAC CREW?

00:37.408 --> 00:39.170
"I MISS THEM.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.172
WHO ARE THESE NEW PEOPLE?
THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD."

00:41.172 --> 00:43.074
NO.
MNH-MNH.

00:43.074 --> 00:48.079
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:48.079 --> 00:51.182
OKAY, GUYS,
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:51.182 --> 00:53.224
AND, NO, ANDY,
FOR THE LAST TIME,

00:53.224 --> 00:55.086
WE'RE NOT HAVING
DUELING SLUMBER PARTIES.

00:55.086 --> 00:58.058
DAMN!I'M NEVER GONNA GET
TO DO A PANTY RAID.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.130
DREAM BIGGER, DUDE.

00:59.130 --> 01:01.332
LOOK, THANKSGIVING IS
MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY

01:01.332 --> 01:03.334
BECAUSE I GET TO TELL
THE PEOPLE I LOVE

01:03.334 --> 01:05.336
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THEM.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.268
SINCE WE MISSED LAST YEAR,

01:07.268 --> 01:11.102
I'VE DECIDED THAT TOMORROW
IS THANKSGIVING.

01:11.102 --> 01:12.203
OH, WELL, AS LONG
AS WE'RE MAKING THINGS UP,

01:12.203 --> 01:13.344
I WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTEND.

01:13.344 --> 01:16.107
I'M DRIVING TO GEORGIA
TO ADOPT A BABY UNICORN.

01:16.107 --> 01:19.110
I DON'T WANT
TO CELEBRATEFAKESGIVING.

01:19.110 --> 01:20.281
(chuckles)
WE'RE NOT CALLING IT THAT.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.113
EVERYONE'S CALLING IT THAT.
(Ellie and Bobby) YEAH.

01:22.113 --> 01:24.185
YEAH. BESIDES, JULES,
I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.157
(chuckles) THANKSGIVING IS
ALWAYS ON THURSDAY.

01:26.157 --> 01:28.088
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
FRIDAY OFF, TOO.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.290
LOT OF FAKE SHOPPING SALES.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.462
SORRY, J-BIRD, TOMORROW IS
NICKEL TACO AT NICKEL'S TACOS,

01:31.462 --> 01:34.295
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH NICKELTACO,WHICH SELLS

01:34.295 --> 01:37.198
TACOS EVERY DAY FOR A NICKEL,
BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT AS GOOD.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.271
LISTEN, HILLBILLY,
YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE HERE

01:40.271 --> 01:42.373
ARE COMING
TO JULES' THANKSGIVING.

01:42.373 --> 01:45.306
YOU MIGHT BE BRAVE ENOUGH
TO SAY NO TO HER.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.239
ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH
TO SAY NO TO ME?

01:48.239 --> 01:50.281
GO AHEAD. SAY SOMETHING, JELLY.
I DARE YOU.

01:50.281 --> 01:52.343
DAMN,TORRES.

01:52.343 --> 01:54.185
(lowered voice)
IF YOU WERE A DUDE,

01:54.185 --> 01:56.247
I'D BE SUPER TURNED-ON
RIGHT NOW.

01:56.247 --> 01:57.448
(lowered voice)
I WOULD WEAR YOU OUT.

01:57.448 --> 01:59.190
(gasps)
(cell phone alert chimes)

01:59.190 --> 02:02.223
NANNY TEXT.
WONDER WHAT STAN DID NOW.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.496
YOUR SON TAGGED MY GARAGE?

02:05.496 --> 02:06.497
GOT SOME GOOD HANDWRITING.

02:06.497 --> 02:08.459
RIGHT?

02:08.459 --> 02:11.332
RELAX. I BUY HIM
WASHABLE PAINT.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.264
WHY WOULD YOU BUY HIM
ANY PAINT?

02:13.264 --> 02:14.505
THE KID'S TOTALLY OUT
OF CONTROL.

02:14.505 --> 02:16.507
PLEASE.
KIDS GET INTO TROUBLE.

02:16.507 --> 02:18.269
(sighs)
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

02:18.269 --> 02:21.141
(chuckles)
HE HAS SO MUCH SPIRIT.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.245
SHE MAKES EXCUSES FOR STAN WHEN
SHE SHOULD BE PUNISHING HIM.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.516
TELL HER.
SHE'S BEING A BAD MOM.

02:25.516 --> 02:28.419
(chuckles) NO, NO, NO.
YOU DONOTWANT TO GO THERE.

02:28.419 --> 02:31.182
TELLING A WOMAN
SHE'S A BAD MOM IS, LIKE,

02:31.182 --> 02:33.324
THE MOST OFFENSIVE THING
YOU CAN SAY TO HER.

02:33.324 --> 02:36.156
I WAS AT THE ZOO IN 1994.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.429
I GAVE TRAVIS
TWO ICE-CREAM CONES.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.331
THEN THIS WOMAN
FROM OMAHA DECIDES

02:40.331 --> 02:42.293
TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT IT.

02:42.293 --> 02:43.494
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I'M GETTING ESCORTED OUT

02:43.494 --> 02:46.237
OF THE PARK WITH A CHUNK
OF HAIR IN MY HAND.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.341
HEY. I HEARD YOU GUYS ARE
HAVING A FAKESGIVING.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.402
NO ONE'S CALLING IT THAT.

02:51.402 --> 02:52.403
EVERYONE IS.

02:52.403 --> 02:54.375
WELL, YOU ARE WELCOME
TO JOIN US.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.247
OH, THANKS,
BUT I'M SCHEDULED

02:56.247 --> 02:58.178
TO PERFORM
ANEURYSM SURGERY.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.310
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
CATCH IT QUICK...

02:59.310 --> 03:01.382
(imitates whoosh
and explosion)

03:01.382 --> 03:03.254
(slurps)

03:03.254 --> 03:05.256
FOR A BRAIN SURGEON,
THAT GUY DRINKS A LOT OF BEER

03:05.256 --> 03:06.557
WHEN HE'S NOT
BRAIN SURGEONING.

03:06.557 --> 03:10.361
HEY, I HAVE SET MY CLOCK
TO COUNT DOWN TO OUR WEDDING.

03:10.361 --> 03:12.323
WE ONLY HAVE
FOUR MONTHS LEFT...

03:12.323 --> 03:13.424
BE MORE INSANE.

03:13.424 --> 03:16.267
AND GUESS WHO IS CRUSHING IT
AT WRITING HER VOWS?

03:16.267 --> 03:19.300
I WANT MY VOWS TO BE JUST
CRAZY ROMANTIC.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.203
ALL BOBBY SAID WAS,
"YOU'RE AWESOME. NICE HOOTS."

03:23.203 --> 03:24.535
(chuckles)
AND THEN HE MOTORBOATED ME.

03:24.535 --> 03:25.536
(imitates motorboat engine
rumbling)

03:25.536 --> 03:27.207
(laughs)

03:27.207 --> 03:28.409
YOU BETTER BRING
YOUR "A" GAME,

03:28.409 --> 03:32.343
BECAUSE MY VOWS ARE SO GOOD,
THEY'LL BLOW YOU AWAY.

03:32.343 --> 03:34.285
YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN
YOUR VOWS, HAVE YOU?

03:34.285 --> 03:37.248
NOT A WORD, BUT GRAYSON NEEDS
ALL THE TIME HE CAN GET.

03:37.248 --> 03:39.420
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT GREAT
AT EXPRESSING HIS FEELINGS.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.592
(chuckles) THIS BOX SHOWS
MORE FEELINGS THAN HE DOES.

03:41.592 --> 03:44.455
LOOK. MM. MM. WAH.

03:44.455 --> 03:47.328
AW, THIS BOX IS SAD.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.533
HOW DID STAN EVEN GET
DOWN HERE?

03:52.533 --> 03:54.435
OH, NO. HE WAS ASKING ME
A LOT OF QUESTIONS

03:54.435 --> 03:56.267
ABOUT THE BUS SCHEDULE.
OH.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.238
LADIES.
UGH.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.242
WELL, IF IT ISN'T MY COMPETITION
FOR THIS YEAR'S MAYORAL RACE.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.344
YOU'RE REALLY RUNNING
FOR MAYOR?

04:03.344 --> 04:04.345
NO BIG DEAL.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.377
IT TOOK 5 MINUTES TO SIGN UP
AND 19 YEARS

04:06.377 --> 04:08.319
IN THE BUSINESS WORLD
TO PREPARE.

04:08.319 --> 04:10.281
EXCUSE ME.

04:10.281 --> 04:13.424
(slurps)
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PIZZA TOSS, CHUMP.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.455
(chuckles)

04:14.455 --> 04:16.327
(sighs)
SEE YOU AT THE WHAT WHAT?

04:16.327 --> 04:17.628
OH, IT'S
SOME DUMB PUBLICITY STUNT

04:17.628 --> 04:19.560
AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.332
THEY GET ALL THE CANDIDATES
TOGETHER,

04:21.332 --> 04:23.394
AND THEY TOSS PIZZAS
FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHERS.

04:23.394 --> 04:25.265
OH, MY GOD. ANDY.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.597
YOU HAVE TO TOSS
THE CRAP OUT OF THAT PIZZA.

04:26.597 --> 04:29.540
ONE BAD PHOTO OP CAN RUIN
A CAMPAIGN.

04:29.540 --> 04:33.404
LOOK... (sighs) WHEN WE HEAR
STUFF ABOUT TAXES AND SCHOOLS,

04:33.404 --> 04:35.306
WE JUST TUNE OUT.

04:35.306 --> 04:37.408
ALL WE EVER REMEMBER
ABOUT CANDIDATES

04:37.408 --> 04:39.279
IS WHO TRADED SEX
FOR CRYSTAL METH,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.451
WHO SHOT AND ATE A DOLPHIN,

04:40.451 --> 04:43.584
AND WHO LOOKED LIKE A MORON
WITH PIZZA DOUGH ON HIS FACE.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.486
COME ON.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.418
(sighs)
OH, I FORGOT TO WASH

04:47.418 --> 04:49.590
THE GRAVY BOAT OUT
FROM LAST YEAR.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.291
OH, NO WORRIES.
IT'S EASIER TO PEEL OFF

04:51.291 --> 04:52.463
WHEN IT HARDENS, ANYWAY.

04:52.463 --> 04:53.564
OH, WOW.

04:53.564 --> 04:56.367
THAT IS
BOTH DISGUSTING AND AWESOME

04:56.367 --> 04:58.329
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

04:58.329 --> 05:00.401
(chuckles)
SO WHAT DID ELLIE WANT?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.602
(gravy boat clatters)
HMM?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.303
COME ON. THAT WHOLE GETTIN'
IN OUR FACES AND YELLIN' AT US

05:03.303 --> 05:06.306
TO SUPPORT YOU--
THAT'S A CLASSIC BUTTER-UP.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.608
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.309
THAT'S WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING
FOR SOMEONE--

05:09.309 --> 05:10.641
WHEN YOU WANT THAT SOMEONE
TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

05:10.641 --> 05:12.543
I DID IT WHEN WE WERE
MARRIED ALL THE TIME.

05:12.543 --> 05:14.314
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WANTED THAT POOL?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.546
I TOLD YOU I'D NEVER CHEAT
ON YOU AGAIN

05:15.546 --> 05:16.617
AND HOW MUCH I LOVED YOU,

05:16.617 --> 05:18.589
AND I GAVE YOU A FOOT RUB
AND WHATNOT.

05:18.589 --> 05:21.592
THEN I ASKED YOU FOR A POOL,
ANDBAM!I GOT A POOL.

05:21.592 --> 05:24.555
AND TWO MONTHS LATER, YOU BANGED
THE POOL GUY'S WIFE IN IT,

05:24.555 --> 05:26.627
AND I LEARNED
THE MEANING OF IRONY.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.359
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:28.359 --> 05:30.661
ELLIE'S MY FRIEND.
THERE'S NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.633
SHE JUST WANTS ME
TO BE HAPPY.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.337
BIG CARL. (sighs) MM.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.710
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME,
BUDDY. MM.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.341
YOU TALK TO HIM A LOT?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.444
ONLY AFTER YOU GO TO BED.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.715
HEY, SLICK.

05:44.715 --> 05:46.517
HOW ARE YOU COMING
WITH THOSE VOWS?

05:46.517 --> 05:47.678
HERE'S A LITTLE BIT.

05:47.678 --> 05:49.680
в™Є FOR BETTER OR WORSE в™Є

05:49.680 --> 05:51.682
в™Є FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE в™Є

05:51.682 --> 05:54.425
в™Є TILL DEATH DO US PART в™Є

05:54.425 --> 05:56.487
в™Є GONNA MAKE YOU MY WIFE в™Є

05:56.487 --> 05:59.630
в™Є 'CAUSE YOU WERE MADE FOR ME в™Є

05:59.630 --> 06:00.731
(chuckles)

06:00.731 --> 06:02.693
(voice breaks)
THAT'S A GOOD START. WHATEVER.

06:02.693 --> 06:05.436
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE
TOMORROW EXTRA SPECIAL?

06:05.436 --> 06:07.698
IF GRAYSON GOT TO HEAR
YOUR VOWS AT DINNER.

06:07.698 --> 06:08.739
WHAT?! (chuckles)

06:08.739 --> 06:10.601
I SHOWED YOU MINE.
YOU SHOW ME YOURS.

06:10.601 --> 06:13.504
CLASSIC SCHOOLYARD RULES, HUH?

06:13.504 --> 06:15.446
I CAN'T WAIT TO SAY THEM.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.450
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

06:19.450 --> 06:20.511
FOR FUN.

06:20.511 --> 06:22.513
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BROUGHT
THAT BOX HOME.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.416
(clicks tongue)

06:25.416 --> 06:28.388
(sighs)
WRITING VOWS IS REALLY HARD.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.590
IT'S TERRIBLE.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.593
"GRAYSON, THERE ARE
SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU.

06:32.593 --> 06:36.467
FOR INSTANCE, I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU HIT A CHILD."

06:36.467 --> 06:37.668
WOW. ALL RIGHT.

06:37.668 --> 06:40.601
UM, I'D HELP YOU
WITH THIS ROMANTIC STUFF,

06:40.601 --> 06:44.475
BUT THIS HERE--
JET-BLACK CAVE FULL OF BATS.

06:44.475 --> 06:47.438
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT,
SWEETIE.

06:47.438 --> 06:49.540
CAN I ASK YOU
A LITTLE FAVOR?

06:50.681 --> 06:52.743
I WAS WONDERING,

06:52.743 --> 06:56.416
DO YOU THINK STAN COULD BE
THE RING BEARER AT YOUR WEDDING?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.689
IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH
TO ME TO HAVE HIM THERE.

06:58.689 --> 07:01.692
PLUS, HE'D LOOK SO CUTE
IN HIS LITTLE TUX.

07:01.692 --> 07:02.693
(chuckles) WOULDN'T HE?
(chuckles) YEAH, HE--

07:02.693 --> 07:04.555
HEY, E-BISCUIT.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.627
STAN'S OUTSIDE TRYING
TO LASSO A PUPPY.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.629
HE IS GETTING GOOD
WITH THAT EXTENSION CORD.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.561
(whispers) HE'S AN ATHLETE.
MM.

07:10.561 --> 07:12.703
(sighs)

07:12.703 --> 07:14.565
GO AHEAD.
(door opens)

07:14.565 --> 07:15.636
(door closes)

07:15.636 --> 07:18.709
THAT BITCH JUST
BUTTERED ME UP.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.875
HEY, Y'ALL.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.146
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
(chuckles)

07:26.146 --> 07:27.217
FAKESGIVING.

07:27.217 --> 07:30.220
SHUSH IT. OKAY, UM, LAURIE,
I HAVE TO ASK YOU,

07:30.220 --> 07:32.082
BECAUSE YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

07:32.082 --> 07:35.085
IS THAT
A COSTUME OR A REAL OUTFIT?

07:35.085 --> 07:36.226
IT'S A COSTUME.

07:36.226 --> 07:38.989
DID YOU GUYS REALLY THINK
THIS WAS MY OUTFIT? (chuckles)

07:38.989 --> 07:42.032
BESIDES THANKSGIVING, I ALSO
MISSED HALLOWEEN LAST YEAR

07:42.032 --> 07:43.894
BECAUSE I WAS GETTING
THAT TATTOO REMOVED

07:43.894 --> 07:45.465
FROM MY UPPER LEFT DRUMSTICK,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
AND THEN ON CHRISTMAS,
I PASSED OUT ON THE BOOZE CRUISE

07:47.467 --> 07:48.999
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE
A CRUISE CRUISE,

07:48.999 --> 07:52.172
AND I WOKE UP IN BELIZE,
SO TODAY I'M GONNA REPRESENT

07:52.172 --> 07:54.204
ALL THREE HOLIDAYS
THAT I MISSED.

07:54.204 --> 07:57.077
HAPPYTHANKS-MAS-WEEN,EVERYONE!

07:57.077 --> 07:59.179
WELL DONE. YOU TOOK
SOMETHING COMPLETELY ABSURD

07:59.179 --> 08:01.181
AND MULTIPLIED IT BY 3.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.914
OKAY, I HAVE MADE A LIST
OF JOBS FOR EVERYONE.

08:03.914 --> 08:07.057
UM, BOBBY, YOUR JOB IS TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO

08:07.057 --> 08:08.188
ON THANKSGIVING.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.060
DRINK BEER
AND WATCH FOOTBALL?

08:10.060 --> 08:11.992
DON'T LET ME DOWN.
OOH.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
GRAYSON AND ANDY,
YOU GO BUY THE CENTERPIECE.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.095
(whispers) GO.
(grunts)

08:15.095 --> 08:16.967
OKAY, MISS KRAZY KAKES...
(Laurie gasps) YES?

08:16.967 --> 08:18.929
YOU'RE GONNA BAKE PIES...
WHOO!

08:18.929 --> 08:21.932
AND, TRAVIS, YOU'RE GOING
TO WRITE MY WEDDING VOWS.
(door opens and closes)

08:21.932 --> 08:23.073
(papers rustle)
WHAT?

08:23.073 --> 08:25.135
YOU GOT ME INTO THIS MESS,
AND BESIDES,

08:25.135 --> 08:26.937
YOU'RE SO CREATIVE.

08:26.937 --> 08:29.940
THAT'S WHY I WORK SO HARD TO PAY
YOUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE.

08:29.940 --> 08:33.013
QUALITY GUILT TRIP.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.085
NOW, ELLIE,
STAN CAN BE THE RING BEARER

08:35.085 --> 08:37.147
IFHE CAN PROVE HE CAN DO IT.

08:37.147 --> 08:38.148
HOW?

08:38.148 --> 08:40.050
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

08:41.151 --> 08:43.093
THINKING EQUALS DRINKING.

08:43.093 --> 08:45.155
OH, SURE, SURE. SURE.

08:45.155 --> 08:48.228
(clinks)

08:48.228 --> 08:50.160
(male announcer
speaking on TV)
THERE'S NO FOOTBALL ON
THIS TIME OF YEAR,

08:50.160 --> 08:55.035
SO I GOT A TAPE OF A GAME
FROM 1949 THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.266
WORKING
ON MOM'S WEDDING VOWS.

08:56.266 --> 08:58.238
(laughs)
YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY INHERIT

08:58.238 --> 09:01.041
THE ROMANTIC GENE
FROM YOUR POPS.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.172
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR WEDDING VOWS,

09:02.172 --> 09:05.045
AND I DON'T THINK MOM WANTS
TO MOTORBOAT GRAYSON.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.977
(chuckles)
HEY, THE CROWD LOVED IT.

09:06.977 --> 09:08.118
WELL, IF YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT IT,

09:08.118 --> 09:10.080
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
ROMANTIC TO THAT BEER?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.022
(clears throat)

09:12.022 --> 09:16.186
BEER, OTHER DRINKS MAY
GET ME DRUNK,

09:16.186 --> 09:19.329
BUT ONLY YOU INTOXICATE ME.

09:19.329 --> 09:22.262
WISH I FELT THAT WAY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.135
(crowd cheering on TV)

09:25.135 --> 09:28.068
IS THAT QUARTERBACK SMOKING?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.140
BACK THEN,
FOOTBALL WAS HARD-CORE.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.572
WHERE ARE
THE HOT BLACK GUYS?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.144
(sighs) I'M SO HAPPY
I'M WASTING MY TIME...
(latch clicks)

09:34.144 --> 09:35.205
DOING THIS
INSTEAD OF LEARNING

09:35.205 --> 09:37.247
HOW TO TOSS A PIZZA
IN FIVE HOURS.

09:37.247 --> 09:38.308
(clatters)

09:38.308 --> 09:41.581
DUDE, TOSSING 'ZA IS EASY.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.315
WHEN VIVIAN LEFT ME, I WATCHED
A LOT OF HOW-TO VIDEOS.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.257
I CAN ALSO TILE A BATHROOM,
MAKE SOAP,

09:47.257 --> 09:49.019
STONEWASH MY OWN JEANS,

09:49.019 --> 09:51.091
OH, AND I CAN SQUEEZE
A PRESSURE POINT ON YOUR HAND

09:51.091 --> 09:53.023
THAT WILL MAKE
YOUR WHOLE BODY RELAX.

09:53.023 --> 09:55.095
GREAT,
'CAUSE I AM FREAKED OUT.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.167
(gasps) GOOD GOD.
THAT'S AMAZING.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.168
YEAH?
WOW.

09:58.168 --> 09:59.169
IT'S LIKE MY LEGS ARE
JUST GONE.

09:59.169 --> 10:00.230
(thud)

10:00.230 --> 10:03.373
SAY HELLO TO THE GAUNTLET.

10:03.373 --> 10:07.207
IF STAN CAN WALK DOWN THIS AISLE
WITHOUT GETTING DISTRACTED,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.079
HE CAN BE THE RING BEARER.

10:09.079 --> 10:11.211
MY BOY IS GONNA CRUSH THIS.
HMM.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.385
(door closes)
THE ONLY WAY DEVIL BABY IS
GONNA BE IN OUR WEDDING

10:15.385 --> 10:18.248
IS IF WE HANNIBAL LECTER HIM
TO A DOLLY.

10:18.248 --> 10:20.220
I DON'T WANT HIM THERE
RAISING HELL EITHER.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.323
(chuckles) I HAVE RIGGED THIS
SO HE CANNOT WIN.

10:23.323 --> 10:27.057
FOR STAN, THIS IS A WALK
OF TEMPTATION.

10:27.057 --> 10:28.628
I'VE GOT
A TABLE FULL OF MARKERS,

10:28.628 --> 10:31.261
A HAMMER... (chuckles)
NEXT TO A JAR OF SHELLS,

10:31.261 --> 10:34.134
AND I BORROWED
THE FLANAGANS' PUPPY.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.406
NOW IS THE PUPPY A DISTRACTION
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH IT

10:36.406 --> 10:38.268
OR... (clicks tongue
and imitates puppy whimper)

10:38.268 --> 10:40.140
(chuckles) WHO CARES?

10:40.140 --> 10:44.114
(suspenseful music playing)

10:44.114 --> 10:46.216
STAN, COME TO MOMMY.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.080
OOH, PERMANENT MARKERS.
(chuckles)

10:50.080 --> 10:52.422
STAN, FOCUS ON ME.

10:52.422 --> 10:55.255
ALL RIGHT. YOU. ME.
COME ON!

10:55.255 --> 10:59.189
STAN, THERE'S A HAMMER. GO NUTS.
SMASH ANYTHING YOU WANT.

11:01.091 --> 11:02.392
DON'T LISTEN TO HER!
IGNORE HER.

11:02.392 --> 11:04.294
(whispers) SHE'S A WITCH.

11:04.294 --> 11:05.295
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

11:05.295 --> 11:07.397
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT. RICE!

11:07.397 --> 11:09.339
THERE YOU GO. YEAH.

11:09.339 --> 11:10.340
(grunts)
GO FOR THE EYES!

11:10.340 --> 11:12.172
I AM!

11:12.172 --> 11:13.343
(chuckles)

11:13.343 --> 11:14.344
IGNORE IT.
(chuckles)

11:14.344 --> 11:16.176
GOOD JOB!

11:16.176 --> 11:18.248
HE'S GONNA BE
YOUR RING BEARER.

11:18.248 --> 11:19.679
YAY.

11:21.211 --> 11:23.253
SO, GUYS, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING ME

11:23.253 --> 11:24.684
WITH THESE WEDDING VOWS.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.186
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES

11:26.186 --> 11:30.690
OF "I CANNOT WAIT TO SHARE
ONE LIFE, ONE HOME,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.222
ONE CONSCIOUSNESS"?

11:32.222 --> 11:33.263
STINKS.

11:33.263 --> 11:37.127
VOWS NEED TO BE HEARTFELT,
TRAV, LIKE,

11:37.127 --> 11:41.201
"GRAYSON, YOU'RE SO HOT
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND

11:41.201 --> 11:43.703
"THAT YOU'RE MATT DAMON
WHEN WE DO IT.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.236
I JUST PRETEND
THAT HE'S WATCHING."

11:46.236 --> 11:47.407
OH, I GOT IT.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.140
"GRAYSON,
YOU ARE MOUNTAIN-BREWED

11:50.140 --> 11:52.142
WITH THE CHOICEST OF HOPS."

11:52.142 --> 11:53.483
CAN ONE OF YOU SAY SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT ABOUT BEER

11:53.483 --> 11:56.316
AND NOT ABOUT HAVING SEX
WITH MATT DAMON?

11:56.316 --> 11:58.288
PFFT. (chuckles)

12:08.228 --> 12:09.299
PILSNER!

12:09.299 --> 12:11.301
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH LESS
THAN ZERO HELP.

12:11.301 --> 12:12.432
(paper rips)

12:12.432 --> 12:16.366
OKAY, I JUST MASHED TOGETHER
A BUNCH OF STAN'S PLAY-DOH

12:16.366 --> 12:19.209
'CAUSE THE CONSISTENCY IS
LIKE PIZZA.

12:19.209 --> 12:20.270
WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER THIS.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.342
SOME OF THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IN STAN'S BUTT.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.443
NOTED.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.246
TOSSING IS
ALL ABOUT CONFIDENCE.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.178
THERE IS NO PIZZA.

12:28.178 --> 12:29.379
THERE'S JUST YOU.

12:31.181 --> 12:32.252
HMM?
OH.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.254
GIVE HER A WHIRL.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.325
HERE WE GO.

12:35.325 --> 12:36.756
OHH.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.528
OH, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT BUILT FOR THIS.

12:38.528 --> 12:41.761
MY HANDS ARE LIKE FIVE
"D" BATTERIES TAPED TO A BAGEL.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.263
NO, NO. LOOK, LOOK,
LOOK, LOOK. YOU'RE FINE.
(clatters)

12:43.263 --> 12:45.465
JUST--JUST STOP BEING
A WUSS. YOU GOT THIS.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.467
I'M--I'M NEVER GONNA GET
TO BE THE MAYOR.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.768
(clatter)

12:48.768 --> 12:49.769
WHOA.

12:53.543 --> 12:56.406
WHY IS EVERYBODY SO DOWN?

12:56.406 --> 12:59.379
BOBBY, YOU'RE NOT EVEN WATCHING
YOUR OLD FOOTBALL GAME.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.410
THOSE DAMN LEATHER HELMETS.

13:00.410 --> 13:04.284
I MEAN, A GUY GOT HIT
AND NEVER GOT UP.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.316
I SAW A MAN DIE. (sighs)

13:06.316 --> 13:09.419
ALL RIGHT. UH, I KNOW WHAT
WILL CHEER EVERYONE UP.

13:09.419 --> 13:11.361
LET'S DRINK A BUNCH OF WINE!
(chuckles)

13:11.361 --> 13:12.362
OH, I LIKE THAT IDEA.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

13:12.362 --> 13:14.364
YEAH, OKAY.
(clears throat)

13:16.496 --> 13:19.369
(lowered voice)
HAND ME THE GLASS.

13:21.301 --> 13:27.307
(slow-motion voice) NO!

13:32.282 --> 13:34.244
(glass shards rattle)
(laughs)

13:34.244 --> 13:36.246
OVERREACTION IN THREE...

13:36.246 --> 13:37.547
(Laurie and Grayson mouth words)
TWO... ONE...

13:37.547 --> 13:39.589
YOUR SON JUST KILLED
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS!

13:39.589 --> 13:41.351
(all, singsongy)
CALLED IT.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.323
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.
I'LL BUY YOU A NEW ONE.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.356
DAMN IT, ELLIE.
DISCIPLINE YOUR SON.

13:46.356 --> 13:48.358
THAT'S HIM BEING OUT OF CONTROL,
AND IT'S YOUR FAULT

13:48.358 --> 13:50.300
FOR BEING A BAD MOM.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.301
(Travis and Grayson) OHH!
OH, NO. NO, NO.

13:51.301 --> 13:52.302
OHH.
WOW.

13:52.302 --> 13:53.403
(Laurie) NO. NO.
(gasps) WOW.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.365
OKAY. TAKE-BACKS?

13:55.365 --> 13:58.368
SCREWYOU,
AND I'M OUT OF HERE.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.613
WELL, THIS IS
THE WORST THANKSGIVING EVER.

14:03.613 --> 14:06.316
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S NOT THANKSGIVING.

14:06.316 --> 14:07.547
(whispers)
SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.154
GREAT NEWS.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.425
MY PATIENT DIED,
AND I BROUGHT WINE.

14:15.425 --> 14:16.486
ARE THOSE ALL FOR YOU?

14:16.486 --> 14:19.159
THIS IS HOW MUCH
BIG CARL USED TO HOLD.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.161
MM.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.393
(swallows) OHH.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.195
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

14:25.195 --> 14:27.537
I SAID THE MEANEST THING
TO ELLIE.

14:27.537 --> 14:29.239
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.271
Y-YOU'RE KIND.
YOU'RE SWEET.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.443
YOU GOT A TUSH
I CAN SET MY WATCH TO.

14:33.443 --> 14:37.177
AW. (chuckles)
THAT WAS WEIRD, BUT... AW.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.178
WELL...

14:38.178 --> 14:39.179
I NEED TO APOLOGIZE
TO ELLIE,

14:39.179 --> 14:40.450
AND I WANT YOU TO COME
WITH ME.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.452
(whispers) SCORE.

14:42.452 --> 14:45.515
(chuckles) DAD, I THOUGHT
YOU COULD USE A COLD ONE.

14:45.515 --> 14:47.187
(clears throat)

14:47.187 --> 14:48.458
LAURIE, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO GET YOU,

14:48.458 --> 14:50.490
SO HERE'S $46.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.322
THIS FEELS LIKE $43.

14:52.322 --> 14:55.295
HMM. I'M SMELLIN'
A BUTTER-UP.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.326
OH.
(sighs)

14:56.326 --> 14:58.428
I'M SORRY I BLEW UP
ABOUT THE VOWS.

14:58.428 --> 14:59.569
PLEASE COME BACK AND HELP.

14:59.569 --> 15:01.231
SUCCESSFULLY BUTTERED.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.433
I WAS RIGHT. THIS IS $43.

15:03.433 --> 15:06.276
THAT'S A WEIRD, SCARY TALENT.
(sighs)

15:09.409 --> 15:12.282
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
THE SADDEST HOLIDAYS

15:12.282 --> 15:14.384
ARE THE ONES SPENT ALONE,

15:14.384 --> 15:16.546
BUT ALONE
ON A FAKE HOLIDAY--

15:16.546 --> 15:18.288
THAT SEEMS WORSE.

15:18.288 --> 15:20.420
YOU ARE GOING TO MISS
THAT PIZZA TOSS, HUH?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.551
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?

15:21.551 --> 15:23.493
GOD, WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT
THIS SO MUCH?

15:23.493 --> 15:27.297
YOU AND I GOTTA BE
A TEAM NOW.

15:27.297 --> 15:28.558
JULES AND ELLIE--
THEY'RE ALREADY A TEAM.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.230
IF WE DON'T HAVE
EACH OTHER'S BACKS,

15:30.230 --> 15:32.232
THEY'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
BULLDOZING US

15:32.232 --> 15:34.534
INTO DOING A BUNCH OF STUFF
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.508
TODAY IT WAS A FAKE HOLIDAY.
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE TOMORROW?

15:38.508 --> 15:41.511
THEY'LL MAKE US GET ITALIAN FOOD
WHEN WE WANT CHINESE.

15:41.511 --> 15:43.613
OH, THAT WILL BE OKAY.
I'LL GET A NICE GNOCCHI.

15:43.613 --> 15:46.416
NO. YOU WANT CHINESE FOOD!

15:46.416 --> 15:48.348
IDOWANT CHINESE FOOD.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.450
THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY?
ARE WE A TEAM?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.622
I WILL STAND WITH YOU.

15:52.622 --> 15:55.525
GREAT. NOW LET'S GO
SLING SOME DOUGH.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.587
(chuckles)

15:57.587 --> 15:58.588
PLEASE DON'T HOLD MY HAND.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.330
OH. SORRY.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.332
THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.394
OH, SURE,
BUT WHY AM I HERE?

16:04.394 --> 16:09.269
WELL, I WANT ELLIE
TO USE UP HER MAD ON YOU.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.441
LOOK, TOM'S HERE...

16:11.441 --> 16:13.273
WITH MUDDY SHOES.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.374
(scoffs)
(high-pitched voice) AAH.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.306
OH, HEY.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.308
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL, BUDDY.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.282
AM I REALLY A BAD MOM?
(door closes)

16:22.282 --> 16:23.483
(clicks tongue) OH, SWEETIE.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.554
NO SHOES IN THE HOUSE.

16:24.554 --> 16:26.616
OH, YEAH. MM.

16:29.619 --> 16:32.362
WELL, NOW I'M 3 FEET TALL.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.366
(grunts)

16:36.366 --> 16:37.367
OHH.
(clatters)

16:37.367 --> 16:38.498
I LIKE THAT BOX'S CONCEPT,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.530
BUT IT'S LIKE
A BURP COFFIN IN THERE.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.472
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR AN HOUR. (sighs)

16:42.472 --> 16:43.603
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.634
I'M HUNGRY.

16:44.634 --> 16:45.635
LET'S GO
TO ELLIE AND ANDY'S.

16:45.635 --> 16:48.438
PEOPLE WITH KIDS HAVE
THE BEST SNACKS.

16:48.438 --> 16:51.611
EXCEPT FOR FOSTER PARENTS.
TOOTHPASTE SANDWICHES, Y'ALL.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.484
PLUS SIDE--I HAVE LITERALLY
NEVER HAD A CAVITY.

16:54.484 --> 16:55.515
(clatters)
OH.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.387
TRUE STORY. COME ON.

16:57.387 --> 17:00.650
OH, HONEY. I AM SO SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.322
I JUST--I FREAKED, YOU KNOW?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.554
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVED BIG CARL.

17:04.554 --> 17:08.398
I MEAN, HE WAS ALWAYS THERE
FOR ME, NEVER JUDGING ME.

17:08.398 --> 17:10.600
JUST THE THOUGHT OF HIM
MAKES ME SMILE.

17:10.600 --> 17:11.661
LAURIE, ARE YOU GETTING
THIS DOWN?

17:11.661 --> 17:13.533
HELL, YEAH, I AM.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.437
WELCOME TO THE GULFHAVEN
MAYORAL PIZZA TOSS!

17:17.437 --> 17:20.410
(cheering)

17:20.410 --> 17:22.542
CANDIDATES! C-CANDIDATES.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.614
(applause)

17:24.614 --> 17:27.677
HI, EVERYBODY. I'M ANDY TORRES,
AND I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

17:27.677 --> 17:30.550
SHUT UP, BALDY!
TOSS THE DOUGH!

17:30.550 --> 17:35.625
(cheering)

17:35.625 --> 17:38.488
(whispering)
THERE IS NO PIZZA.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.360
"THERE'S SNOW PEAS, BRA"?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.691
(normal voice)
THERE IS NO PIZZA!

17:41.691 --> 17:43.563
(lowered voice)
THERE'S JUST YOU.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.694
(chuckles) YEAH.

17:44.694 --> 17:47.667
READY? GO AHEAD.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.672
(epic theme music playing)

17:52.672 --> 17:56.376
(crowd cheering)

18:01.751 --> 18:05.585
(laughs)

18:05.585 --> 18:06.656
YOUR MOVE, MAYOR.

18:06.656 --> 18:10.590
(cheering)

18:15.525 --> 18:17.527
SO YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
I'M A BAD MOM?

18:17.527 --> 18:19.569
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT THE WORST.

18:19.569 --> 18:22.472
BUT YOU KNOW WHY I IGNORE
ALL THE CRAP THAT STAN DOES?

18:22.472 --> 18:23.703
IT'S NOT 'CAUSE I THINK
IT'S FUNNY.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.635
I IGNORE IT JUST
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO ADMIT

18:25.635 --> 18:27.637
MY KID IS A NIGHTMARE.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.709
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S HOW THIS
IS GONNA GO DOWN.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.681
I'M GONNA HELP YOU BE
STRICT WITH STAN.

18:31.681 --> 18:33.683
HE'S GONNA HATE ME.
FOR, LIKE, A MINUTE,

18:33.683 --> 18:36.546
AND YOU'RE GONNA FORGET MOST
OF THE BAD TIMES ANYWAY,

18:36.546 --> 18:38.418
ALTHOUGH IT IS HARD
TO FORGET THAT PHASE THAT

18:38.418 --> 18:41.551
TRAVIS SCREAMED EVERY TIME
HE SAW AN ETHNIC PERSON.

18:41.551 --> 18:42.692
MY MOM STILL DOES THAT.

18:42.692 --> 18:43.753
THIS IS GONNA SUCK
FOR A WHILE.

18:43.753 --> 18:47.657
IT WILL, BUT I PROMISE YOU,
BY THE TIME STAN IS 9,

18:47.657 --> 18:50.500
HE'S GONNA BE SLEEPING
IN YOUR BED EVERY NIGHT.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.763
WELL, THAT MIGHT JUST BE
TRAVIS AND ME. HMM.

18:53.763 --> 18:56.736
WE HAD A SLEEPOVER
LAST TUESDAY. (chuckles)

18:56.736 --> 18:58.508
OH, CUTE.

18:58.508 --> 19:00.640
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER KID,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.513
AND BEFORE I KNOW IT,
STAN'S GONNA BE A GROWN-UP,

19:03.513 --> 19:05.715
AND YOU
AND EVERY OTHER MOM I KNOW

19:05.715 --> 19:07.717
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT
THOSE MEMORIES

19:07.717 --> 19:09.649
WHERE THEIR KID DOES
SOMETHING SO CUTE

19:09.649 --> 19:12.522
THAT EVERYONE SAYS, "AW."
IT'S NOT FAIR.

19:12.522 --> 19:15.525
I'M NEVER GONNA HAVE ONE
OF THOSE MOMENTS.

19:15.525 --> 19:16.656
WELL, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE
YOU WILL,

19:16.656 --> 19:18.588
THEN I'LL BELIEVE FOR YOU.

19:18.588 --> 19:21.661
THANK YOU.
THE BATS ARE SMILING.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.832
(chuckles)

19:22.832 --> 19:25.565
OKAY, FIRST
I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE ANDY...

19:25.565 --> 19:26.736
AND THANK HIM AND GRAYSON

19:26.736 --> 19:29.599
FOR
THE VERY CREATIVE CENTERPIECE.

19:29.599 --> 19:31.801
IT'S A WATERMELON
SPRAY-PAINTED ORANGE.

19:31.801 --> 19:34.474
I THINK YOU OWE ME SOME VOWS.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.546
HAND ME THE NOTEPAD.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.608
(chuckles)

19:38.608 --> 19:42.482
"GRAYSON, YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE
FOR ME, NEVER JUDGING ME.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.813
JUST THE THOUGHT OF YOU
CAN MAKE ME SMILE."

19:43.813 --> 19:44.814
(Jules and Grayson chuckle)

19:44.814 --> 19:46.586
(whispers)
THESE ARE PERFECT.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.659
"I LOVE THAT I CAN FIT
AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF WINE IN YOU

19:49.659 --> 19:52.562
AND CARRY YOU AROUND."

19:52.562 --> 19:53.863
(whispers) WE SHOULD HAVE
CHANGED SOME STUFF.

19:53.863 --> 19:54.864
(whispers) YOU THINK?

19:54.864 --> 19:56.696
MOST OF IT WAS VERY NICE.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.827
ALL RIGHT.
(notepad clatters)

19:57.827 --> 19:58.828
LET'S HOLD HANDS.

19:58.828 --> 20:00.770
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:00.770 --> 20:02.872
OKAY, WHAT I LOVE MOST
ABOUT THANKSGIVING,

20:02.872 --> 20:04.774
EVEN IN THE SPRING,
IS THAT I GET

20:04.774 --> 20:06.706
TO BE AROUND ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.777
COULD I SAY SOMETHING?

20:07.777 --> 20:09.709
OH, HEY. I FORGOT
YOU WERE HERE. (chuckles)

20:09.709 --> 20:10.810
UH, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

20:10.810 --> 20:13.783
I AM SO HAPPY YOU LET ME BE
PART OF YOUR GROUP.

20:13.783 --> 20:17.547
WELL... (chuckles)
NO, NO. LET HIM HAVE IT.

20:17.547 --> 20:19.789
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING
MY FRIENDS.

20:19.789 --> 20:20.790
MM.
LET'S EAT.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.552
OKAY. (chuckles)
YAY.

20:22.552 --> 20:23.593
HEY, WHERE'S THE TURKEY?

20:23.593 --> 20:25.525
HAPPY THANKSGIVING, EVERYONE.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.597
OH, MY GOSH!
(Andy, Jules, Bobby,
Grayson, and Travis) AW.

20:27.597 --> 20:29.529
(man) в™Є SEE, I'M GONNA CHANGE
MY MIND в™Є

20:29.529 --> 20:31.531
в™Є CHANGE MY MIND в™Є

20:31.531 --> 20:32.602
(lowered voice) HOW'D YOU GET
HIM TO DO THAT?

20:32.602 --> 20:34.864
I PROMISED HIM
FOUR CANS OF SPRAY PAINT.

20:34.864 --> 20:37.667
YOU SHOULD PARK IN THE GARAGE
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

20:37.667 --> 20:38.908
YOU WANT--YOU WANT
TO CARVE?
YEAH.

20:38.908 --> 20:40.610
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
THE NEW DAD'S GONNA...

20:40.610 --> 20:42.912
(Laurie) LADIES, WINE?
(indistinct conversations)

20:47.317 --> 20:50.980
WE'RE ALL HERE TO PAY
OUR RESPECTS TO BIG CARL.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.953
I REMEMBER
WHEN I FIRST MET BIG CARL.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.755
HE WAS THE BASE OF A LAMP.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.928
(voice breaks) MM. I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE CROSSROADS, HOMIE.

20:58.928 --> 21:01.260
OH, NO. NOT THIS AGAIN.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.833
WITH ENDINGS COME
NEW BEGINNINGS.

21:03.833 --> 21:07.036
EVERYONE, SAY HELLO
TO BIG LOU.

21:07.036 --> 21:08.037
HI THERE.
OHH.

21:08.037 --> 21:09.038
(whispers) YEAH.

21:09.038 --> 21:12.302
(normal voice)
REST IN PEACE, BIG CARL.

21:12.302 --> 21:14.904
(voice breaks) WE'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER THE GOOD TIMES.

21:14.904 --> 21:17.907
(sentimental music playing
on piano)

21:25.014 --> 21:27.286
(bells tinkle)
