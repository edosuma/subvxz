WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:04.119
Okay.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.750
--Hinges.
--Yes.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.797
Screwdriver.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.297
Plunger.

00:14.182 --> 00:18.016
--Duct tape.
--Oh, sweet. Tiki lights.

00:18.102 --> 00:20.343
I thought we were just going to
concentrate on the essentials.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.975
Hello? Essentials.

00:24.692 --> 00:28.605
With a little work, our crack shack is
going to start feeling downright homey.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.280
Yeah, well, it's already the closest
thing I've had since I ran away at 18.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.278
So, where does a little Fae
sex killer grow up anyway?

00:35.369 --> 00:39.783
Small town Midwest. All car
shows and church socials.

00:39.874 --> 00:43.833
That would turn me homicidal.
Do you ever go back?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.535
It's kind of tough,

00:45.630 --> 00:47.791
growing up thinking that you might
have a shot at being prom queen,

00:47.882 --> 00:52.967
and find out that you're part of some
ageless, secret race that feeds on humans.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.919
I hate when that happens.

00:58.935 --> 01:00.641
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.310
I'm getting hungry.

01:03.397 --> 01:08.767
Okay. How about we make a deal,
we don't kill where we shop, okay?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.738
Trust me, buddy, you already got lucky.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.212
Come on, show yourself, you coward.

01:32.802 --> 01:34.588
What, is that the best you've got?

02:04.709 --> 02:06.165
Nice try.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.516
No, no, no, not this time.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.721
Gotcha!

03:13.361 --> 03:16.273
[BO] Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.276
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.279
My love carries a death sentence.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.486
l was lost for years,

03:24.580 --> 03:27.162
searching, while hiding,

03:27.249 --> 03:31.458
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:31.545 --> 03:36.414
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:43.307 --> 03:47.391
Easy! Not everyone here is
a nookie-powered Amazon.

03:47.478 --> 03:50.515
Whose idea was it to get a
ZOO-pound sideboard, anyway?

03:50.606 --> 03:52.642
Did somebody tell you we
were going to live like savages?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.645
--'Cause it wasn't me.
--Just lift.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.193
You know, filling this place
with furniture is one thing,

03:58.280 --> 03:59.986
paying for it is another.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.189
No problem.

04:01.283 --> 04:05.026
Really? You hoping I have some kind
of Fae money power I wasn't aware of?

04:05.121 --> 04:09.160
Didn't cost a thing.
We sort of liberated it.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.582
Oh no. No, no, we are not thieves.

04:11.669 --> 04:16.584
"Thieves" is such a harsh word.
Think of it more as redistribution.

04:16.674 --> 04:18.039
Okay, let's get one thing straight--

04:18.134 --> 04:20.716
We stay alive as long as we
don't piss off the Fae too much.

04:20.803 --> 04:24.341
We are not doing anything that draws
any extra attention to ourselves.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.888
Are you good with that?

04:25.975 --> 04:28.091
Define "good."

04:29.270 --> 04:31.932
--[BO] Holy crap!
--[KENZ|] Shit!

04:32.022 --> 04:33.353
Sorry about the couch.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.726
Oh!

04:36.277 --> 04:38.689
Okay, you have exactly two seconds
to tell us who the hell you are

04:38.779 --> 04:40.189
and what you're doing in our house.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.521
Well, look at you.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.072
You're everything the rumours in
the Fae community said you'd be.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.946
Wrong answer.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.698
--Oh, come on.
--Oh, come on. Enough already.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.780
lt's flaming, oh!

04:53.377 --> 04:55.538
Sorry about the fires.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.211
It's a reflex. Hell on the furniture,

04:58.299 --> 05:00.381
but it's kept me alive for a long time.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.584
Yeah, well, all good things
come to an end, buddy.

05:02.678 --> 05:06.762
See? See people always
go right to the violence.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.464
And I wonder why I stay elusive.

05:08.559 --> 05:09.639
Well, why don't you
tell us what you want

05:09.727 --> 05:12.093
and then you can elusive
yourself right out of here.

05:12.188 --> 05:15.897
Most people call me Will.
I'm a Will of the Wisp.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.396
You sure that's not a Chas of the
chunky or Bob of the butterball?

05:19.487 --> 05:22.445
Hey, I wrestle with my weight.
What can I say?

05:22.531 --> 05:23.987
You were telling us why you're here.

05:24.074 --> 05:28.488
Well, here's the deal, see? I'm a
woodland Fae--light, just so you know.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.911
| live in the forest outside of town.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.989
What, skipping and
a-jumping all of the day?

05:33.083 --> 05:35.244
Hey, there's no shame in that.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.827
And, of course, there are humans
who wander into my turf,

05:37.922 --> 05:42.586
crashing through the woods, cutting
down trees, looking for my treasure.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.089
Whoa! Did you just say "treasure"?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.590
Hey, get with the program.

05:47.681 --> 05:52.095
That's what this is all about.
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds.

05:52.186 --> 05:57.431
Sir! Have a seat. Have a seat.
That smell isn't bothering me at all.

05:57.525 --> 06:02.315
Okay. So I spend my nights searching
the woods for precious stones.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.360
What, like, they're just lying around?

06:04.448 --> 06:06.939
If you know where to look.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.367
Most of the humans that have heard
about it, that are out searchin',

06:10.454 --> 06:14.117
I'm able to throw them off with
a few well-placed fairy fires.

06:14.208 --> 06:18.042
But there's this one human, he's
been hunting me down for years.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.961
A couple of nights ago, he got past
the best I could throw at him

06:21.048 --> 06:25.633
and found my stash. I got home
and it was gone, all of it.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.380
And you want me to
help you get it back?

06:27.471 --> 06:30.133
Well, why not? You're
smart, you're capable,

06:30.224 --> 06:32.715
and best of all, you're
not part of the system.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.893
Okay. So why would you trust me?

06:35.980 --> 06:40.474
Because... I have
something you'll want.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.399
I'm not a big fan of riddles.

06:42.486 --> 06:47.571
First of all, l have to know
something. It's about your feet.

06:47.658 --> 06:51.025
--Kinky.
--Oh, please, grow up, will you?

06:51.120 --> 06:55.204
When I heard about the girl that
didn't know where she came from,

06:55.291 --> 06:57.156
thought it might be you.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.492
But I need to know for sure.

06:59.587 --> 07:03.000
Do you have a birthmark on your
left foot, just above the heel?

07:03.090 --> 07:05.331
How did you know that?

07:05.426 --> 07:08.668
Oh, true story, this.
Happened 28 years ago.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.718
l was in my woods, minding my own
business, and all of a sudden,

07:10.806 --> 07:13.218
there's this woman,
crashing through the brush.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.516
Yeah, and we're supposed
to care about this, why?

07:15.603 --> 07:19.516
Because the bundle she
was carrying was a baby.

07:19.607 --> 07:24.226
A little Fae girl with a birthmark on
her left foot, just above the heel.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.733
Bam! Got your interest now, right?

07:30.159 --> 07:34.903
--What else do you know?
--Uh-uh. Not so fast.

07:34.997 --> 07:39.411
That only happens
after you help me out.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.366
You do realize that it
might be hard to find

07:41.462 --> 07:45.546
some random guy in the
woods that stole your stuff.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.294
He dropped this.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.421
Maybe there's something in
here that'll help you track him.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.299
I'll see what I can do.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.807
What she means by that is she'll
see what she can do for a price.

08:00.898 --> 08:04.390
You know, we can talk flat rate
or a return of the percentage or--

08:04.485 --> 08:07.227
Excuse us.

08:07.321 --> 08:11.155
Look, this is not about money.
I need to know about my parents.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.324
Do you really think this
bozo can tell you anything?

08:14.411 --> 08:17.118
It's a chance I'm willing to take.

08:25.673 --> 08:29.086
[HALE] Saturday night, I'm out with Katia,
right, the girl l was telling you about.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.916
[DYSON] Remind me--human or Fae?

08:31.011 --> 08:33.297
This girl is all Fae, okay.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.596
So, after dinner we're back at
her place having a drink,

08:35.683 --> 08:38.766
listening to some music and one
thing kind of leads to another.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.183
Amazing how that happens, uh.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.852
Yes. So we're kissing right, she's
running her hands through my hair,

08:42.940 --> 08:45.352
unbuttoning my shirt,
stroking my man chest--

08:45.442 --> 08:47.478
--Stop it.
--Only, suddenly,

08:47.569 --> 08:49.480
there are a few too many hands.

08:49.571 --> 08:55.988
Yeah, I open my eyes,
two of her, man, yeah.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.943
--A Gemini?
--Yes.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.155
Both of them drop-dead gorgeous,
both of them wanting it bad.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.787
Just the way you're qualified
to deliver, my friend.

09:03.877 --> 09:07.665
Dude, I have sung my way into a lot
of women's pants over the years,

09:07.756 --> 09:11.214
but I promise you, this was the most
profound night of my life, man.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.293
They played ice cream sandwich,
okay. I was the ice cream.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.379
--Hey, man, that sounds profound.
--Yeah, yeah.

09:16.473 --> 09:20.341
Why | tell you is this:
She's got a twin sister, okay.

09:20.436 --> 09:25.976
Also a splitter, also gorgeous. So
you, me, Katia, Karen, double date.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.809
Technically, I think that's a quadruple
date, but let me get back to you.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.519
I think I've got something
to take care of.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.196
And I thought I was in over my head.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.744
How'd you get in here?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.913
I said that l was your girlfriend.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.207
Nobody seemed to have
a problem with it.

09:45.294 --> 09:50.880
I bet. Gentlemen, would you mind
just giving us a moment, please?

09:50.966 --> 09:52.422
Thanks.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.918
Are you okay?

09:56.013 --> 09:59.597
Yeah, I'm fine. You said that I could
find you here if I needed help.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.344
| just didn't think it would be this soon.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.517
Are you that disappointed to see me?

10:03.604 --> 10:06.186
That depends. What do you need?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.264
You look hungry. Should I be worried?

10:08.358 --> 10:10.849
You mean am I going to
go on a murder spree?

10:10.944 --> 10:17.816
No, I'm okay. But I do need help
tracking down who this belongs to.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.736
How the hell did you get this in here?

10:22.831 --> 10:26.039
My client needs to find somebody
who took something from him.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.539
He promised me info on my real
parents if I helped him out.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.212
That means this client is Fae.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.756
Well, there's a reason
you're a detective, huh?

10:34.843 --> 10:38.882
Bo, this is not a good idea.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.715
You should stay out of the
Fae world, just live your life.

10:42.810 --> 10:46.052
There's just one small problem.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.980
| wind up killing everyone
that I let close to me.

10:50.067 --> 10:55.107
Look, you are the only one of them that
I can talk to. You have to help me out.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.733
No, I don't.

10:56.824 --> 11:01.318
Fine. I'll get help elsewhere.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.073
But I've got to warn you--
this could get messy.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.075
I mean, I get taken in by human cops,

11:06.166 --> 11:10.830
l have no problem telling them
what I am or what any of you are.

11:14.383 --> 11:19.093
The Morrigan was right.
You are dangerous.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.795
Well, flattery will get you everywhere.

11:23.350 --> 11:27.434
Buddy, can you run the
registration on this for me?

11:27.521 --> 11:29.807
There's something I got to do.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.145
Are you sure we want to
get involved in this?

11:34.236 --> 11:38.195
I'm not sure about anything,
but just... just do it, okay.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.158
And you, come with me.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.110
Where are we going?

11:45.205 --> 11:48.493
You want to play in this world,
you got to learn the rules.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.376
[BO] |f getting a Fae education
is all about visiting a bar,

11:56.466 --> 11:58.843
then I should have
been schooled already.

11:58.927 --> 12:02.465
Well, this isn't quite your normal
bar. These are all our people.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.844
Your people maybe.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.391
It's a place where we don't
have to hide who we really are.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.970
--Dyson.
--l have someone you should meet.

12:12.065 --> 12:16.684
Trick, this is Bo. Bo, this is Trick.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.485
He's one of our elders and the
keeper of this waystation.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.690
Non-locals who pass through
have to declare themselves here.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.571
Well, your people have more
rules than my old high school.

12:25.662 --> 12:30.247
The Dal is also a place where all Fae
can find sanctuary from persecution.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.416
|t's neutral ground for
light and dark Fae.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.039
Well, the looks people are
giving me are hardly neutral.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.712
The politics of remaining
undeclared are complicated.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.925
Well, I'm not very political.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.000
Well, that's not something you
get to decide on your own.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.086
Okay, look, I just need somebody
to be straight with me.

12:44.181 --> 12:47.765
I'm, like, a baby here.
There's stuff l have to know.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.387
Come with me.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.729
Nice décor. Early Tolkien?

13:01.823 --> 13:04.906
Where do you think he got it from?

13:04.993 --> 13:12.911
Okay, Bo, mother's and father's names.

13:13.001 --> 13:17.210
Sam and Mary Dennis.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.255
I mean your real parents.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.878
You tell me.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.756
Well, we know they're both Fae.

13:24.846 --> 13:25.710
How do you know?

13:25.806 --> 13:28.718
Those born of only one Fae
don't have any Fae abilities.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.893
And you most certainly do.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.973
I guess you'll remain a
mystery. Sign in then.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.785
So, how about you helping me out?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.836
What do you know about us?

14:00.924 --> 14:04.166
That there are two types
of Fae, dark and light.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.468
That neither likes the other very much.

14:06.555 --> 14:11.140
And that all have some
kind of freaky going on.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.764
I suppose "freaky" is in the
eye of the beholder.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.471
And the issue between
the light and dark Fae

14:17.566 --> 14:20.023
is a little more than just
not liking each other.

14:20.110 --> 14:23.694
We've been on the edge of a war
for more than a thousand years.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.645
That's holding a grudge.

14:25.741 --> 14:30.485
A war between our people would end
the human race, as well as ours.

14:30.579 --> 14:34.322
Well, if you people are so powerful,
how do you stay under the radar?

14:34.416 --> 14:39.160
It's more comfortable
for us to remain a myth.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.664
But it's difficult to do that,

14:40.756 --> 14:44.624
especially when someone keeps
asking too many questions.

14:44.718 --> 14:48.131
Meaning me. Look--

14:48.221 --> 14:54.717
for some reason, my real parents
dumped me and I need to know why.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.187
Maybe they did it to protect you.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.808
Leaving your kid to grow up to
think that they're a serial killer

14:58.899 --> 15:03.393
without knowing how or why?
That's a hell of a way to protect them.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.728
Have you ever thought that maybe
what they were shielding you from

15:05.822 --> 15:08.074
might have been much worse?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.992
My office called while
you were in the back.

15:20.087 --> 15:24.046
The gun is registered to a
guy named Michael Connell.

15:24.132 --> 15:28.216
He lives in the north end
of the city in a trailer park.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.258
So, what are you going to do?

15:29.346 --> 15:33.009
Pay him a visit. Try to see
if he has my client's goods.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.011
I hope you leave him in one piece.

15:35.102 --> 15:39.596
Well, if not, I'll be sure he
goes with a smile on his face.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.020
I'm kidding.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.850
Bo, be careful who you trust.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.402
There's still a lot you don't know
and people will use that against you.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.899
Thanks.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.373
She's going to get herself killed
if she keeps going this way.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.120
I'm gonna have to find
a way to manage her.

16:01.211 --> 16:06.422
If she's who I think she is, managing her
will be more than any of us are up to.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.608
Well, if this guy's sitting
on a fortune in jewels,

16:26.695 --> 16:28.777
I hope he's planning
to upgrade his crib.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.196
I'm sure he'll appreciate the advice.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.174
Crap!
[g u n cocks]

17:01.855 --> 17:03.811
It's one hell of a doorbell.

17:10.739 --> 17:14.231
Tell me again why taking this
case is better than stealing.

17:21.458 --> 17:27.294
Fairy Folk and You, Mysterious Folklore
Creatures, Encyclopaedia of Legends.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.042
This is not light reading.
This is research.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.715
Will was right.
Connell was hunting him.

17:34.387 --> 17:41.680
"G.W. Thompson Company, Ltd. We buy
and sell jewels, wholesale and retail."

17:41.770 --> 17:44.307
If I just came into possession
of a pantload of gems,

17:44.397 --> 17:46.058
this is the guy I'd want to go visit.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.731
Yeah. A guy we might
want to visit, too.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.485
Hello, girls. Going somewhere?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.531
Actually, we're kind of in a hurry.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.860
Oh, you're kind of in a hurry.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.250
Oh, honey, you better have
such a damn good excuse

18:04.334 --> 18:07.201
for what the hell you're doing
here in my neighbour's place.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.998
--We're friends of Connell's.
--Friends?

18:12.092 --> 18:16.677
Yeah, we came to visit
and he must have forgot.

18:16.763 --> 18:21.757
Imagine, a pretty little thing like you
robbing a man's house and home.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.685
I'm sure we can work this out
without getting the police involved.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.854
Hey, hey, hey, no, no,
you stay. You stay--

18:27.941 --> 18:33.607
Hey, hey, hey--| just want to explain
it to you. It'll all make sense.

18:33.697 --> 18:34.857
I promise.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.690
--Bo!
--Just a snack.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.617
I've never had a...

18:40.704 --> 18:42.444
Bo, that's enough!

18:44.958 --> 18:49.918
Bo, stop, you're killing her! Bo, stop it!

18:50.005 --> 18:54.339
Ah! Bo, stop, it's me.
[choking]

19:00.640 --> 19:02.176
I'm sorry.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.720
I'm sorry. Thanks for the cockblock.

19:07.814 --> 19:12.103
Yeah, maybe next time,
I'll do it from a distance.

19:12.193 --> 19:15.401
Is she okay?

19:15.488 --> 19:19.606
Yeah. Thanks to you.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.910
Oh my god, you're totally healed.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.961
The side benefit of a feed.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.289
That's a hell of a health plan.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.965
Yeah, trust me, you couldn't
afford the premiums.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.591
Hey, what are we doing? Are you going
to tell Will his guy's on the run?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.421
You tell him. I'm going
to drop you off at home.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.098
Keep him there. Make sure he
doesn't burn the place down.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.642
Where are you going?

19:47.729 --> 19:49.685
I'm going jewellery shopping.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.984
Can I help you?

19:57.072 --> 20:01.782
I have an anniversary coming up and my
husband said the sky is the limit.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.859
So, I was thinking why
not make it jewellery.

20:03.953 --> 20:04.817
Of course you did.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.529
And if it was going to be jewels, I
thought of buying some raw stones

20:07.624 --> 20:09.285
and choosing the settings later.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.789
Someone told me that you have a nice
selection of unset stones right now.

20:12.879 --> 20:17.464
I don't deal in unset stones. If you don't
see it in the cases, it's not available.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.460
If you'll excuse me.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.633
Oh, hell.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.838
Look, I don't do undercover well,
okay, so let's talk straight about this.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.471
You bought a load of uncut jewels
from a guy named Michael Connell.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.973
He took them from a guy that
I know and I need to find him.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.679
I don't know any Connell.

20:32.774 --> 20:36.983
Oh, this is not going to go well.
Which hand do I break first?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.150
--What?
--Which hand?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.899
You've only got two and
I don't have all night.

20:39.989 --> 20:40.978
Ohh!

20:41.074 --> 20:45.363
Where is he? Simple.
You tell me and I'm gone.

20:45.453 --> 20:49.822
Lakeview Motel. He met with me
at the Lakeview Motel, Room 205.

20:49.916 --> 20:54.876
I could only afford some of them. I said
I'd be back later this week for more.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.876
Well, you probably won't be
making that appointment.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.960
Oh, by the way, that
emerald pendant is to die for.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.097
Dude, could you stop that?

21:12.188 --> 21:17.353
I told you, I can't help it.
Maybe if you'd stop watching me.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.902
It's kind of hard. For a sprite,
you take up a lot of real estate.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.445
Oh.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.570
I didn't mean anything by that.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.902
I'm large. I know it.

21:28.997 --> 21:34.208
What? I get lonely,
I get depressed, I binge.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.125
Aren't there people that
can help you with that?

21:36.212 --> 21:39.045
Like some kind of Fae Fat
Watchers or something?

21:39.132 --> 21:41.293
I don't exactly show up for meetings.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.249
Yeah, I guess not.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.922
--Yo.
--[BO] It's me. I've got an address.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.804
I think Connell's at the
Lakeview Motel. Meet me there.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.102
Should I bring our farty little friend?

21:54.189 --> 21:55.929
Let's just see if Connell's there first.

21:56.024 --> 22:00.108
Okay, good. I didn't really want to
singe the car upholstery, anyway.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.826
The succubus is having
herself some kind of party.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.575
Anybody asking any questions?

22:12.665 --> 22:16.453
I've laid some dulcet tones down
on anyone who took an interest.

22:16.544 --> 22:20.332
How many bodies are we going to
have to disappear for this chick?

22:20.423 --> 22:21.788
Maybe she didn't have a choice.

22:21.883 --> 22:27.674
Maybe she's out of control.
What the hell was she doing here?

22:27.764 --> 22:29.425
I don't know, but what
I do want to know

22:29.516 --> 22:32.929
is why someone rigs a
shotgun on their front door.

22:33.019 --> 22:36.511
Jehovah's Witnesses? I'm just saying.

22:36.606 --> 22:42.272
Look, we get our hands on Little Miss
Killer Kitty, maybe we'll find out both.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.728
All right. Get on it.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.526
He's still there.

22:51.621 --> 22:55.330
Sweet. Let's break in and get yakuza
on this guy's Fae-robbing ass.

22:55.416 --> 22:59.876
You stay here and watch the door.
I'll try to do this on the QT.

22:59.963 --> 23:03.626
Well, you're not gonna...

23:03.716 --> 23:08.756
Don't worry. The woman from the trailer
park will hold me over for a while.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.502
Maid service.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.046
[CONNELL] Come on in.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.853
I'll try to make this fast.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.183
Take your time. I'm not going
anywhere. I'm waiting for someone.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.688
Oh yeah?

24:06.779 --> 24:11.364
Surprised that someone's keeping such
a handsome guy like you waiting.

24:11.451 --> 24:15.785
You know what? I think it might
be you that I'm waiting for.

24:17.957 --> 24:24.078
Whoa! Whatever kind of date you're
expecting, you've got it all wrong.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.249
Maid was here a half hour ago.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.551
I knew he'd send somebody
for me. Where is he?

24:31.638 --> 24:32.923
"He," who?

24:33.014 --> 24:36.802
The man from the woods. My father.

24:47.153 --> 24:51.146
Okay, this doesn't make any sense.
Will can't be your father.

24:54.911 --> 24:59.245
No. I mean, yeah. You're normal.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.913
But you're not.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.743
He wouldn't have trusted someone
who wasn't one of them. You're Fae.

25:04.837 --> 25:05.997
I guess so.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.330
It took me years to learn
about all of this stuff.

25:08.424 --> 25:13.339
See, only my father was Fae,
so I didn't inherit anything.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.805
Never even got to know him.

25:14.889 --> 25:18.097
Okay, hold on. You've got to back this up
a few steps here. I'm missing something.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.176
You like fairy-tale romances?

25:21.270 --> 25:24.558
Here's one my mother told me a
thousand times when I was a kid...

25:26.859 --> 25:29.896
My mom worked at a research
station in those woods.

25:31.531 --> 25:38.118
One night, she's looking out the window
and she sees some green lights.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.445
She tries to follow them.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.826
Before she knows it, she gets lost.

25:42.917 --> 25:46.830
Next thing she knows,
there's some guy standing there.

25:46.921 --> 25:50.288
Don't tell me. Kind of an odd guy in
serious need of a wardrobe makeover?

25:50.383 --> 25:52.795
He seemed nice.

25:52.885 --> 25:57.174
He brought her food and wine, he told
her he can get her out of the woods.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.631
It was a romantic night,
full moon and everything.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.466
I'm afraid I know where this is going.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.802
When she left the woods that
night, she was pregnant with me.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.148
Look, if you have some
kind of daddy issues,

26:06.232 --> 26:08.314
there are other ways that
you can take it up with him.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.062
You think I haven't tried?

26:10.153 --> 26:13.691
My mom wasted years of her life,
just trying to find him to tell him,

26:13.781 --> 26:16.568
but all he did was distract
her with those stupid fires.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.992
In the end, she made herself sick,
just stumbling around in the dark.

26:20.079 --> 26:24.869
She died with everyone still
thinking that she was crazy.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.824
And so you figure you're
entitled to his treasure.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.707
I don't care about the treasure.
I just want to see him.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.254
| just want him to know me.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.252
Well, robbing him is a
hell of an introduction.

26:34.343 --> 26:39.508
Look, you know him, right?
He hired you to get his stuff back?

26:39.599 --> 26:44.343
I have the jewels in a locker at
Fortress Self Storage on 15th.

26:44.437 --> 26:49.898
You get him to meet me,
he can have it all back.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.501
Oh, crap balls!

27:16.511 --> 27:20.595
You sit tight and I'll call you
when I speak to him, okay?

27:22.016 --> 27:24.098
--Friend of yours?
--He followed you!

27:27.688 --> 27:30.020
Get out of here. I can handle this.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.279
Ah!

27:46.666 --> 27:49.282
Bo! Cleaning product, ten o'clock!

27:52.255 --> 27:54.871
Oh, it's like he's got eyes
in the back of his head.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.467
[BO] Minus the head!

28:06.435 --> 28:11.975
This is a new level of freaky.
You sure this job is worth it?

28:12.066 --> 28:14.728
I'm starting to wonder.

28:18.698 --> 28:22.691
[indistinct chatter]

28:22.785 --> 28:24.150
Hey.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.949
Bo, this isn't a place to bring a human.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.450
Where I go, she goes.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.952
You're claiming her?

28:31.043 --> 28:31.953
Yes.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.161
The girl is with her.

28:35.256 --> 28:39.465
Understand, she's your
responsibility from this point on.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.794
Try not to steal anything, okay?

28:42.889 --> 28:46.848
I'm checking in, like you asked.
We've got a small problem.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.344
"Well?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.352
I've got a body in the trunk of my car.

28:59.447 --> 29:03.235
And in a bag in the back seat.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.863
The girl from the trailer park
wasn't enough for you for one day?

29:05.953 --> 29:07.409
--Okay, you noticed, huh?
--Yeah.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.488
I know I didn't call you about
that, but this is different, okay?

29:10.583 --> 29:13.199
I found the guy that
stole my guy's jewels.

29:13.294 --> 29:16.206
And then there was another guy that
was trying to take the other guy out--

29:16.297 --> 29:18.379
Okay, okay, you lost
me at the second guy.

29:18.466 --> 29:19.831
Bo, you can't keep doing this, okay?

29:19.926 --> 29:23.214
I promise you--this is not
how I planned my day.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.425
Just show it to me.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.520
First problem: No head.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.347
He started that way.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.058
Yeah, second problem: it's a Dullahan.

29:39.153 --> 29:44.773
Okay, obvious question--
What the hell is a Dullahan?

29:44.867 --> 29:48.030
Well, you can say that they're
the mercenaries of the Fae world.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.112
Over the millennia, they evolved
the ability to remove their heads.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.289
Like the headless horseman.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.583
They use it to throw
fear into their victims.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.752
As a victim, I can vouch it works.

29:57.838 --> 30:01.376
They're usually unstoppable, Bo.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.549
I guess someone forgot to tell this guy.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.878
Or maybe he wasn't listening.

30:06.973 --> 30:10.431
Do you get it? No head.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.679
--Okay.
--I need to talk to you.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.059
Look, you have been lucky so far,

30:21.153 --> 30:23.565
but you are living in a world
you know nothing about.

30:23.656 --> 30:26.398
Well, I'm learning damn fast.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.572
Are you okay?

30:27.660 --> 30:30.823
I need to look up the light
Fae's doctor, Lauren.

30:30.913 --> 30:34.405
She said that she could help me to
take the edge off my lethal libido.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.910
That's asking a lot.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.243
Not so much.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.922
There are other ways for you
to deal with that problem.

30:43.009 --> 30:47.343
No offense, but I don't
want to owe your team.

30:47.430 --> 30:52.015
And I'm looking for a more
long-term solution. So...

30:52.101 --> 30:54.262
can you get me her number?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.969
Don't tell anybody
you got this from me.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.949
Look what I found in
Mr. No Head's pockets.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.119
Looks like Will isn't the
only one after the jewels.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.117
Either that, or this was payment
for taking out Connell.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.460
Looks like your friend Will's
got some 'splaining to do.

31:18.544 --> 31:22.162
Yeah, well, let's make sure he does that
before more bodies start piling up.

31:30.806 --> 31:31.795
Will!

31:31.891 --> 31:34.724
Oh, hey, hi. I was just wondering
where you guys were.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.550
Yeah, move.

31:38.939 --> 31:45.230
Oh, now that's handy. You just, like,
pull the trigger and, "Pphhtt!" It's out.

31:45.321 --> 31:46.982
I really have to get one of those.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.405
No.

31:49.492 --> 31:52.199
What you really have to start
doing is telling us the truth.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.242
You sent a headless
nightmare after Connell.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.241
What? You mean like a Dullahan?

31:56.332 --> 31:59.165
Oh, no way. I hate those
things. They're creepy.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.334
Beautiful. Now, we have the
pot calling the kettle creepy.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.254
Yeah, but you got away, right?
I mean, you're here.

32:05.341 --> 32:07.832
So what happened?
You catch this Connell?

32:07.927 --> 32:11.010
I barely helped him
escape in one piece.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.930
Um, maybe we had a
miscommunication. You know,

32:14.016 --> 32:17.179
I spend a lot of time on my own,
talk to myself a fair bit.

32:17.269 --> 32:21.854
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
But I did say to catch him, didn't I?

32:21.941 --> 32:24.853
Connell is your son.

32:24.944 --> 32:25.854
My what?

32:25.945 --> 32:27.560
Your son.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.024
T-That's enough.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.405
I mean, I c-couldn't be.
Me--me--me, a daddy?

32:35.496 --> 32:40.035
About thirty years ago, there
was a woman lost in the woods.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.582
You gave her food and wine--

32:41.669 --> 32:46.254
And then, you know,
"bow chicka wow wow."

32:47.007 --> 32:48.588
A woman...

32:50.344 --> 32:54.257
Ella? No. Ellie. Yeah. That's right.

32:54.348 --> 32:58.057
Oh, she was beautiful
even for a human.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.100
We... uh...

33:02.982 --> 33:04.688
Oh, shit.

33:08.529 --> 33:10.986
I'm a daddy.

33:11.073 --> 33:14.440
What does he do?
D-Does he look like me?

33:14.535 --> 33:17.902
He's got to be tall, right?
This is terrific.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.158
What am I talking about?
This is horrible.

33:20.249 --> 33:23.741
He's human. He can't know about me.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.578
That cat's way out of the bag.

33:26.672 --> 33:31.006
That's the whole reason he took your
jewels. He just wants to meet you.

33:33.888 --> 33:38.257
I want to meet him, too.
I could bring him something.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.808
What do you think? Teddy bear?

33:43.439 --> 33:44.770
Fire truck?

33:44.857 --> 33:51.103
Just come with us to see him.
That's all he wants.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.438
I have a stop to make and then
I'll work it out with Connell.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.648
Just wait here until I call you.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.404
Mm hm.

34:00.206 --> 34:04.540
Hey, it's not every day you
become a father, right?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.467
How long have you
been standing there?

34:15.554 --> 34:20.218
Not long. I like watching
a professional at work.

34:20.309 --> 34:23.142
Ah, well, it's just boring research.

34:23.229 --> 34:27.848
Yeah, well, some of that boring research
may stop me from killing someone.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.478
You, uh--you said that you might be
able to do something about my hunger.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.732
Does that offer still stand?

34:34.823 --> 34:36.563
You don't understand the
politics of this world.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.900
It could be dangerous for
me to even talk to you.

34:38.994 --> 34:43.158
The last thing I want to do is get
you in trouble, but I need this.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.080
Should I be worried right now?

34:45.167 --> 34:49.911
I have desires. Not
enough to kill someone.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.712
Who else has to say this kind of stuff?

34:54.134 --> 35:00.505
If you don't do it for me, then do it
for the next person that I feed on.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.091
There is something I developed
for an incubus I treated.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.186
If I'm right, it should take
the edge off your hunger,

35:08.274 --> 35:11.186
but it won't allow you to heal.

35:11.277 --> 35:16.192
Let's see if we can ramp you
back to randy. Or frisky, even.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.273
Take your jacket off.

35:20.286 --> 35:26.031
If you learn to control your abilities,
you might actually like being Fae.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.786
Maybe.

35:30.879 --> 35:34.042
You should think about
joining the light Fae.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.215
I wouldn't have to
hide my helping you.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.964
Well, they'd have to
loosen up a bit first,

35:39.054 --> 35:41.261
start playing by my rules.

35:45.311 --> 35:48.053
Seriously, thank you.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.603
Uh huh.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.289
Connell!

36:27.186 --> 36:29.347
Connell, you here?

36:33.400 --> 36:36.767
I didn't know if you'd come.
You talked to my dad?

36:36.862 --> 36:40.446
Yeah. He wants to see you as
much as you want to see him.

36:40.532 --> 36:46.778
I can't believe it. After all this time,
I'm actually going to see him.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.908
Do it. Call him.

36:55.714 --> 37:01.675
Kenzi, he's here.
Yeah, he's ready to meet.

37:01.762 --> 37:05.550
Okay, twenty minutes at
the Fortress Self Storage.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.924
You still have the gems?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.159
What is this?

37:36.255 --> 37:40.214
I'm sorry, I'm not going to be
happy with just a reunion.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.712
The world's got to know what he did.
My mother wasn't crazy.

37:42.803 --> 37:46.170
No, you don't want to do this,
Connell. The Fae won't let you.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.005
They won't have a choice.

37:48.100 --> 37:52.218
They kill me once I've outed them,
this thing will go even bigger.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.896
This is everything I've ever wanted
since I was a kid. Throw me your phone.

37:57.526 --> 38:00.563
You're fast, but you're
not that fast. Come on.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.032
Connell! Connell! Let me out of here.

38:11.123 --> 38:15.958
It's no use. You don't
understand what it's like...

38:16.044 --> 38:18.751
being abandoned by your father.
Not knowing who he is.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.420
Knowing he doesn't
give a damn about you.

38:20.507 --> 38:24.045
I do know! My Fae
parents abandoned me.

38:24.136 --> 38:27.469
They dumped me with foster parents and
I didn't even know that they existed.

38:27.556 --> 38:29.638
Not until the Fae started
happening to me.

38:29.725 --> 38:33.638
At least you got something out of it.
You're special, you're like them.

38:33.729 --> 38:37.893
Talk to him first. See what he says.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.396
We played it his way for
the last twenty years.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.603
Now we're going to play it my way.

38:51.830 --> 38:56.073
--Bo?
--Kenzi! Get out of here, it's a trap.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.454
--Go!
--Hold it. Hold it!

38:59.922 --> 39:02.083
I know your tricks, old man.
You're not going anywhere.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.586
I thought this was
supposed to be a reunion.

39:04.676 --> 39:09.261
You think you can just walk back
into my life like nothing's happened?

39:09.348 --> 39:11.088
The whole world's going
to know you're real.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.172
They're going to know what
you did to my mother.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.768
You can't do that.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.639
He's got the gun. He can
pretty well do what he wants.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.436
Your mother didn't understand.

39:18.524 --> 39:21.015
One of us can't be with
one of you forever.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.976
You didn't even give us a chance.

39:24.071 --> 39:26.938
All I wanted to do was see you.
I just wanted to get to know you.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.945
What I did, I did for her own good.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.995
Before you knew it, she'd
want to know her own kind.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.706
And she'd want to tell
them who she was with.

39:38.794 --> 39:43.379
She'd tell them about me.
I couldn't risk that.

39:45.259 --> 39:48.717
Didn't you even think about her?

39:48.804 --> 39:53.798
I did. But time moves
differently for my kind.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.055
Things are going to move
pretty fast from here on.

39:57.145 --> 40:02.890
You're stubborn. You got a
lot of your old man's traits.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.732
You did this!

40:07.823 --> 40:10.906
I didn't know you were my son.

40:10.993 --> 40:13.484
--Kenzi! In here.
--Call it off.

40:13.579 --> 40:17.197
I can't. Once they take a job,
they always follow through.

40:37.102 --> 40:41.516
Hey, flattop! We can both keep a calm
head on our shoulders here, okay?

40:41.607 --> 40:46.647
Bad analogy. I mean, nobody
has to lose a head, okay?

41:09.301 --> 41:10.541
So, what now?

41:10.636 --> 41:14.128
--I owe you a story.
--Better make it fast, Willy.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.599
That woman I saw running
with the baby that night,

41:16.683 --> 41:19.299
she was a Fae midwife.
She was scared.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.386
Why wasn't I with my real
parents? Were they dead?

41:22.481 --> 41:26.724
I don't know. This midwife wasn't
exactly what you'd call chatty.

41:26.818 --> 41:31.903
But what she did say was she was afraid.
She said someone was trying to hurt you.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.230
Who?

41:33.325 --> 41:38.786
That's all she said. Hey, you know
more now than you did before, right?

41:42.250 --> 41:46.414
I don't know what the story
was with your parents, Bo.

41:46.505 --> 41:53.047
But maybe they do want to see you.
Find them. Give them a chance.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.928
God, I hate when he does that.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.760
They're gone, and great--he
took the swag with him.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.812
Bo? Bo, do you need a doctor?

42:05.899 --> 42:08.982
No. Get me Dyson.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.147
[DYSON] Bo, have you
thought this through?

42:11.238 --> 42:14.822
[BO] No, but it's the only way I heal.

42:34.970 --> 42:37.712
Are you sure you have
enough medical experience?

42:37.806 --> 42:39.592
I know what you need.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.228
Are you going to keep doing this?

42:48.942 --> 42:51.854
If you don't want to help me,
I'll find somebody else.

43:02.247 --> 43:06.206
Are you sure you can handle it?
I won't kill you?

43:06.293 --> 43:08.534
I'll take my chances.
