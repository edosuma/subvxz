Look, uh...

35:55.718 --> 35:58.186
We're never going
to get out of here on foot.

35:59.521 --> 36:01.857
And that vehicle
is pretty heavily guarded.

36:03.493 --> 36:06.361

a coms back to our base.

You're the only other person
with Special Forces training, right?

36:21.011 --> 36:25.081
I need you to look after these
people until I get back.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.050
You can do that
for me?

36:28.620 --> 36:31.089
Yeah.
Okay?

36:31.623 --> 36:32.690
Yeah.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.033
Thanks.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.336
Good luck.

with you and the accountant?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.452
I like her.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.354
You guys have known each other
for a whole three hours,

37:03.388 --> 37:05.757
and she's walking around without
your handprint on her ass.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.325
I don't know
what to think.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.427
I don't know.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.531
She's different.

37:13.566 --> 37:14.612
Different? What do you mean?

37:14.637 --> 37:15.992
You haven't shagged
a blonde this week?

37:17.903 --> 37:20.405
No. I don't mean that.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.907
I do mean this, though.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.510
"Fuck you."

37:25.544 --> 37:27.979
Yeah, that's
more like it.

37:28.013 --> 37:31.516
Anyway, you got your
own thing going on.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.685
She's a little old for my taste.
Mrs. Heath?

37:33.719 --> 37:36.788
I'd rather be saving her than
some toerag spook.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.322
Basic impression,
he seems in good shape.

42:32.356 --> 42:34.291
He used alcohol,
but in moderation,

42:34.325 --> 42:36.260
he lied about his work
in a believable way

42:36.294 --> 42:38.996
and kept the conversation
neutral and light.

In fact, past a certain
superficial point,

42:41.800 --> 42:44.901
I found Sergeant Scott
completely impenetrable,

intellectually
and emotionally.

And the rest?

42:49.673 --> 42:51.841
In bed there was
nothing weird or violent.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.864
He didn't talk in his sleep
and in the morning he finished

it quickly and honestly.

him attractive?
