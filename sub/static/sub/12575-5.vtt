12:35.520 --> 12:38.580
<i>So get your heart off its butt
and back to work.</i>

12:38.657 --> 12:41.751
You're right, Uncle Hank.
What am I waiting for?

12:42.060 --> 12:43.721
Let's go get Wade!

12:45.397 --> 12:46.887
[Music stops]

12:46.998 --> 12:49.398
Bill, you need more confidence in yourself.

<i>If you ask Peggy Hill,
you Boot Scoot with the best of them.</i>

12:54.172 --> 12:57.232
<i>EMCEE: All right,
this next one's going to be ladies' choice.</i>

12:57.309 --> 12:58.833
Excuse me, Bill.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.537
[Music starts again]

13:01.513 --> 13:02.537
Hey, Peggy.

13:02.614 --> 13:06.072
Better than aerobics, huh?
You worked up quite a sweat.

13:06.151 --> 13:07.914
That's not my sweat.

13:14.526 --> 13:17.017
- Where's Luanne?
- Luanne's fine.

13:17.095 --> 13:21.498
<i>She's gonna get a ride home with a friend.
Tush-push on three!</i>

13:21.566 --> 13:22.931
And three!

13:27.939 --> 13:30.669
Is Luanne going to marry
her new boyfriend?

13:30.775 --> 13:34.506
Well, you never can tell.
But my guess is, yeah.

13:35.013 --> 13:36.207
BUCKLEY: Luanne!

13:36.581 --> 13:39.448
HANK: That's Buckley!
Those better be for me!

13:39.518 --> 13:42.544
No, they're for me for later.
Where's Luanne?

13:42.621 --> 13:44.885
Luanne is out with her new boyfriend.

13:44.956 --> 13:47.322
<i>She's in love. You blew it, diphead.</i>

13:47.392 --> 13:50.520
You can't compete with this new guy.
He's a football player.

13:50.595 --> 13:53.189
And football players
know how to treat women right.

13:53.265 --> 13:56.029
Now get off my lawn, and don't come back.

13:57.502 --> 14:00.801
Why did you send Buckley away?
Luanne wants him back.

14:00.939 --> 14:03.772
Not going to happen.
I found her a new guy.

14:03.875 --> 14:07.276
You broke the rebound rule?
What has gotten into you, Hank?

14:07.345 --> 14:11.008
Well, I was kind of hoping
she might fall in love with Wade.

14:11.082 --> 14:14.916
<i>Hope in one hand and boo in the other.
See which one gets full first.</i>

14:14.986 --> 14:18.820
You are out of your depth, Hank Hill.
You've opened a Pandora's Box.

14:18.890 --> 14:22.382
A box that has a sign that reads,
"For Women Only."

14:22.994 --> 14:26.486
<i>As long as it took that river to carve
the Grand Canyon...</i>

14:26.565 --> 14:30.934
that is how long women have been learning
to subtly manipulate relationships.

14:31.002 --> 14:33.266
You only think it's easy...

14:33.338 --> 14:35.363
because we make it look easy.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.567
Did you really believe...

14:37.642 --> 14:40.372
you could step in and fix it overnight?

14:40.645 --> 14:43.011
Could you really be such a fool?

14:43.448 --> 14:46.252
Woe is you, Hank Hill. Woe is you!

14:46.518 --> 14:49.419
No! Everything is going to be fine.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.021
Wade's a good guy.
You don't know. He runs fast.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.525
It'll be fine.

14:54.593 --> 14:55.582
[Tires screeching]

14:55.661 --> 14:56.855
What's that?

14:58.664 --> 15:00.689
<i>See? Everything's fine.</i>

15:00.766 --> 15:02.757
Good old Wade drove her home.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.100
Look at that, he's fixed his Dodge up
just like Boomhauer's.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.639
PEGGY: Why on earth
would anyone do that?

15:08.774 --> 15:10.139
Boomhauer!

15:11.744 --> 15:14.338
Good night. Thanks for the lift.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.104
No!

15:28.961 --> 15:31.327
HANK: Luanne, what happened to Wade?

15:31.397 --> 15:34.332
Why aren't you with Wade? I want Wade!

15:34.433 --> 15:37.925
<i>As soon as you left,
Wade turned into Mr. Grabby Sam.</i>

15:38.003 --> 15:41.029
I think you fixed me up with him
to get your den back.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.165
<i>Thank goodness Boomhauer gave me a lift.</i>

15:43.242 --> 15:46.439
A lift? Is that
what they're calling it these days?

15:46.512 --> 15:48.002
You can't trust this guy.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.277
He's a no-good, immoral,
skirt-chasing rascal.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.113
At least you like him better than Buckley.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.620
What are you saying?
He's your new boyfriend?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.350
<i>PEGGY: Hank?
LUANNE: So? What if he is?</i>

15:58.424 --> 16:00.415
If he is, he ain't no more!

16:00.492 --> 16:03.359
You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my father.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.762
Yeah, I guess not. Damn straight I'm not.

16:06.832 --> 16:09.926
But while you're under my roof,
I'm your landlord!

16:10.002 --> 16:12.903
And as your landlord,
I forbid you to date Boomhauer!

16:12.971 --> 16:15.701
<i>- Shut up, Hank.
- I can find another roof!</i>

16:15.774 --> 16:17.537
I'll stay at Boomhauer's!

16:17.609 --> 16:18.769
- Fine!
- Fine!

16:18.844 --> 16:21.278
Hey, wait, man. This ain't gonna work out...

16:21.347 --> 16:24.111
these little gals coming around here,
flat out no, man.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.810
Thanks, Boomhauer. Let's go.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.411
These dang old women from Mars, man.
I'll tell you what.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.191
Don't go in there, Luanne. I'm warning you.

16:38.263 --> 16:39.753
<i>You'll be sorry!</i>

16:39.832 --> 16:43.427
<i>DALE: Damn it! This neighborhood
is turning into Melrose Place.</i>

16:49.608 --> 16:51.473
[Leaf blower running]

16:55.681 --> 16:59.173
Hank, it is after midnight!
What the heck are you doing?

16:59.251 --> 17:01.811
Clearing some space for my leaf blower.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.948
Hank, this is not about
the leaf blower, is it?

17:06.023 --> 17:07.355
<i>Sure it is.</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:11.056
<i>[Swallowing]</i>

17:11.997 --> 17:13.657
- What are you eating?
- Nothing.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.858
You're eating your emotions, aren't you?

17:15.934 --> 17:18.266
Maybe. Who knows?
I don't care. Whatever.

17:18.337 --> 17:22.068
You thought you could fix Luanne
like a flywheel drive plate.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.336
But a flywheel drive plate
doesn't talk back.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.605
Flywheel drive plates do not have feelings.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.078
- Flywheel drive plates...
- I took her in, Peg.

17:29.148 --> 17:33.551
I put a 20-year roof over her head
and a sofa sleeper under the rest of her.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.645
And this is the thanks I get?
Well, no thanks.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.482
[Gulping]

17:39.324 --> 17:40.814
Just face it, Hank Hill.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.727
The only reason you're this upset is
because you care so much about Luanne.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.595
The only thing I care about
is getting my den back.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.963
Boy, I've never been in here before.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.871
It sure is bachelory.

That's real pretty. Gosh.

18:05.117 --> 18:08.018
You move very fast, Boomhauer, but...

18:08.320 --> 18:12.416
I'm having all these feelings,

18:26.138 --> 18:28.663
That cradle robber's
getting none of my beer.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.503
Boomhauer didn't do anything.

18:30.576 --> 18:33.977
Even if he did, why do you care?
Luanne's not your relation.

18:34.046 --> 18:38.745
Hell, she's my wife's brother's daughter.
You can't get any closer than that.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.719
Look, let's just split that six-pack up.
We can each take two.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.650
Tell you what, I'll take the whole thing.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.493
Okay, Mom, let's try a move of my own.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.024
And split kick right, and back...

18:53.098 --> 18:56.295
and split kick left, and sideways shuffle.

Go!

- Are you okay, Bobby?
- Yeah.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.608
Well, it was a nice move.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.411
- Yeah.
- Oh, honey.

19:06.945 --> 19:09.880
- It's just not right without Luanne.
- Yeah.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.115
This was a nice idea, Peg.
Get us out of that house.

Luanne! And Boomhauer, too.
Well, isn't this a nice surprise?

19:35.374 --> 19:37.604
Is that gravy lumpy tonight?

19:37.709 --> 19:39.939
Hi, Aunt Peggy, Uncle Hank.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.210
I'll take a bowl of the white gravy
and a bowl of brown gravy.

Hey, Dad. Can't you hear me?
Luanne, right behind you!

19:57.663 --> 20:01.292
Hank, man, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you've got to know...

<i>I'm no Woody Allen with that Soon-Li.
Nothing's going to happen.</i>

Boomhauer, you're not going
to talk your way out of this one.

20:08.674 --> 20:12.371
- Uncle Hank, I was...
- Don't "Uncle" me anymore, Luanne.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.470
Just come on by tomorrow,
and pick your stuff up.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.015

by her new boyfriend, Boomhauer.

[Whispering] He didn't dump her, you did.
