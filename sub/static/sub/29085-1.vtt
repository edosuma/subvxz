<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

00:39.547 --> 00:41.916
<i>and this man's
going to collect.</i>

00:42.048 --> 00:43.450
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

00:43.584 --> 00:44.952
<i>and he lives by...</i>

00:45.084 --> 00:46.786
Bounty Law.

00:46.919 --> 00:49.590
You don't ever bring them in
alive, do you, Jake?

00:49.724 --> 00:52.093
Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

00:57.331 --> 00:58.799
What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

00:58.932 --> 01:00.300
I'm looking
at an ugly owl-hoot

01:00.434 --> 01:02.803
about to get his jaw busted.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.004
Amateurs try
and take men in alive.

01:07.740 --> 01:09.242
Amateurs usually
don't make it.

01:09.377 --> 01:11.245
<i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

01:11.377 --> 01:14.948
<i>you're just a dollar sign</i>
<i>to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

01:15.082 --> 01:17.651
<i>Thursdays at 8:30,
only on NBC.</i>

01:22.156 --> 01:23.023
Hello, everybody.

01:23.156 --> 01:24.325
This is Allen Kincade

01:24.457 --> 01:26.359
on the set
of the exciting hit NBC

01:26.493 --> 01:28.863
and Screen Gems television
series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

01:28.996 --> 01:30.798
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

01:30.931 --> 01:32.433
don't adjust
your television sets

01:32.567 --> 01:34.635
because, well,
in a way, you are.

01:34.769 --> 01:36.603
To my right
is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead

01:36.737 --> 01:38.939
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

01:39.073 --> 01:41.842
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

01:41.975 --> 01:43.710
Welcome and thanks for
taking the time

01:43.844 --> 01:46.179
- to visit with us.
- It's our pleasure, Allen.

01:46.312 --> 01:48.082
So, Rick,
explain to the audience

01:48.216 --> 01:50.552
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

01:51.484 --> 01:53.019
Well...

01:53.153 --> 01:56.157
actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.225
Say Jake Cahill
gets shot off his horse.

01:59.359 --> 02:01.561
Now, can I fall off
a horse?

02:01.695 --> 02:04.364
Yes, I can,
and, yes, I have.

02:07.868 --> 02:10.638
But say I fall off wrong
and I sprain my wrist

02:10.770 --> 02:12.206
or I... or I
twist my ankle.

02:12.339 --> 02:15.341
Now, that can put
an undue burden on production

02:15.476 --> 02:17.544
because now maybe
I can't work for a week.

02:17.678 --> 02:20.381
So Cliff here is meant to help
carry the load.

02:20.514 --> 02:22.883
Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

02:23.017 --> 02:26.119
What, carrying his load?
Yeah, that's about right.

02:30.423 --> 02:33.026
Join me next week on the set
of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

02:33.160 --> 02:34.996
where I'll be talking
to comical cutups,

02:35.129 --> 02:36.730
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

02:36.863 --> 02:40.100
Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

03:56.510 --> 03:58.812
Hi. I missed you.

04:02.982 --> 04:04.885
The black one.
And the flowers.

04:05.018 --> 04:06.352
Flowers, Ava, flowers.

04:06.487 --> 04:07.855
And there's the small one.

04:07.988 --> 04:09.288
Can I see your tickets?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.859
Oh, good boy.

05:11.351 --> 05:13.887
Gina, Gina, Gina.

05:14.021 --> 05:15.689
The face
in the misty light.

05:15.822 --> 05:18.758
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

05:18.892 --> 05:22.897
I, uh... I have a meeting
with a very handsome cowboy man.

05:23.029 --> 05:25.031
He's waiting
for you in the bar.

05:25.765 --> 05:26.632
Ah.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.269
Well...

05:28.401 --> 05:30.137
since I just finished
watching

05:30.269 --> 05:32.438
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

05:32.572 --> 05:35.241
I think I know who you are.
Put it there.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.810
Well, it's my pleasure,
Mr. Schwartz.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.745
And thank you
for taking an interest.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.415
<i>Schwarz,</i> not Schwartz.

05:41.548 --> 05:44.385
Ah. G-goddamn it to hell.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

05:44.517 --> 05:47.587
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

05:47.721 --> 05:49.288
Marvin, call me Rick.

05:49.423 --> 05:50.725
- Rick?
- Yeah.

05:50.858 --> 05:52.860
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

05:52.993 --> 05:55.396
No, that's my stunt double,
Cliff Booth. Yeah.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.296
- Good to meet you.
- We've worked together

05:57.430 --> 05:59.298
since the last two seasons
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

05:59.433 --> 06:00.634
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop,

06:00.767 --> 06:02.069
so he gave me a ride.

06:02.202 --> 06:03.771
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

06:03.904 --> 06:05.738
<i>Rick got his driver's license
taken away</i>

06:05.873 --> 06:07.442
<i>for too many
drunk-driving tickets.</i>

06:07.575 --> 06:09.010
<i>Cliff drives him
everywhere now.</i>

06:09.142 --> 06:10.276
Oh, fuck.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.879
Well, sounds
like a good friend.

06:12.012 --> 06:13.947
- I try.
- Mm.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.716
I wanna send you greetings
from my wife,

06:16.849 --> 06:18.752
Mary Alice <i>Schwarz.</i>

06:18.885 --> 06:21.288
Oh, well, that's nice.

06:23.024 --> 06:24.759
Thanks a lot.

06:26.592 --> 06:29.863
We had a Rick Dalton
double feature

06:29.997 --> 06:31.665
in our screening room
last night.

06:31.798 --> 06:35.969
Oh, well, that's both
flattering and-and embarrassing.

06:36.103 --> 06:37.672
What'd you see?

06:37.805 --> 06:40.674
Thirty-five mm prints
of <i>Tanner</i>

06:40.808 --> 06:43.110
and <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

06:49.216 --> 06:52.586
I hope the, uh,
Rick Dalton double feature

06:52.719 --> 06:55.822
wasn't too painful for you
and the... And the missus.

06:55.955 --> 06:59.960
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop.
What are you saying?

07:01.594 --> 07:03.130
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

07:03.262 --> 07:05.132
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

07:05.264 --> 07:06.866
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.136
<i>And we thoroughly
enjoyed</i> Tanner.

07:09.269 --> 07:10.571
Oh, that's nice.

07:10.704 --> 07:12.840
It's really good.
And anyway, she goes to bed.

07:12.973 --> 07:16.009
<i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i>

07:16.142 --> 07:22.482
<i>I light up, I pour myself
a cognac and I watch...</i>

07:22.615 --> 07:25.051
<i>The Fourteen Fists
of McCluskey.</i>

07:25.185 --> 07:26.820
What a picture.

07:26.954 --> 07:28.689
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

07:28.822 --> 07:30.591
That is so much fun.

07:30.724 --> 07:31.724
All the shooting.

07:35.394 --> 07:37.430
I love that stuff.
You know, the killing.

07:37.563 --> 07:39.532
A lot of killing.
Lot of killing, yeah.

07:39.666 --> 07:43.370
Now, gentlemen,
the plan is, we reverse our forces

07:43.502 --> 07:46.474
<i>und</i> drive the Allies
back into the sea!

07:49.342 --> 07:50.543
Genius.

07:50.676 --> 07:52.312
Panzer divisions come in,

07:52.445 --> 07:54.981
and we drive them here
to the ocean.

07:55.115 --> 07:56.483
They'll be up against
the wall.

07:56.615 --> 07:58.685
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

07:58.819 --> 08:01.022
This is the spot...

08:01.988 --> 08:03.389
Hermann!

08:05.526 --> 08:06.427
Open the curtains.

08:26.212 --> 08:29.248
Anybody order
fried sauerkraut?

08:46.065 --> 08:49.569
Burn, you Nazi bastards!
Ha-ha-ha!

08:49.703 --> 08:53.574
That's you operating
the flamethrower, isn't it?

08:53.706 --> 08:55.608
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was. Yeah.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.511
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

08:57.645 --> 08:59.680
that-that's one shit-fuck
crazy weapon

08:59.813 --> 09:01.982
y-y-you do not wanna be
on the wrong side of.

09:02.116 --> 09:03.484
Boy, oh, boy.

09:03.617 --> 09:06.386
You know, I practiced
with that dragon, uh,

09:06.520 --> 09:08.288
three hours a day
for two weeks.

09:08.421 --> 09:10.156
Not just because
I wanted to look good

09:10.290 --> 09:11.892
in the picture,
but because I was...

09:12.025 --> 09:14.127
I was shit-scared
of the thing, to be honest.

09:15.061 --> 09:16.662
Mike fucking Lewis!

09:16.796 --> 09:18.330
Crisping them Nazis
to hell!

09:18.464 --> 09:19.999
Oh, shit, that's...

09:20.132 --> 09:21.634
All right,
that's too hot.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.769
Anything we can do
about that heat?

09:23.903 --> 09:26.506
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

09:26.641 --> 09:29.843
So I came to the office
early today,

09:29.977 --> 09:35.516
and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

09:35.648 --> 09:37.349
Jody Janice,

09:37.483 --> 09:39.853
wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

09:39.987 --> 09:43.190
$425 dead or alive.

09:44.525 --> 09:46.793
And you brought him here
to collect.

09:46.926 --> 09:49.529
I don't even know
where here is.

09:49.662 --> 09:51.731
It was just
the closest place.

09:51.864 --> 09:54.667
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

09:54.801 --> 09:56.736
So, bounty killer,

09:56.869 --> 10:00.240
the name of this town
is Janicetown.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.310
And that boy you killed...

10:04.444 --> 10:07.680
was Jody Janice.

10:07.814 --> 10:11.851
He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

10:11.984 --> 10:13.786
Hmm.

10:13.921 --> 10:17.791
Who's
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

10:17.924 --> 10:23.329
Well, I'll be sure
and introduce you

10:23.463 --> 10:25.565
when he gets here.

10:44.350 --> 10:46.419
Bounty Law.

10:49.355 --> 10:52.859
<i>Starring Rick Dalton.</i>

10:52.993 --> 10:56.229
<i>Then a couple of the
jokers over in archival sent over</i>

11:24.257 --> 11:26.926
on episodic TV shows
the last couple of years?

11:27.060 --> 11:32.865
Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot
f-for CBS right now.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.434
It's called... It's called
<i>Lancer.</i> I play the heavy.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.072
Did a, ahem,
Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

11:38.204 --> 11:41.108
I did a <i>Land of the Giants.</i>
<i>Green Hornet.</i>

11:41.241 --> 11:43.110
I did that show, uh...

11:43.243 --> 11:46.512
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid
Scott Brown. Yeah.

11:46.647 --> 11:49.916
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i>
that-that airs this Sunday.

11:50.050 --> 11:53.620
You, um... You always play
the bad guy on these shows?

11:53.752 --> 11:56.455
- Y-yeah. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

11:56.589 --> 11:59.358
So, and they have a fight scene
at the end of them?

11:59.492 --> 12:01.127
Well, not... Not...

12:01.261 --> 12:03.530
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i>
or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

12:03.662 --> 12:06.599
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

12:06.733 --> 12:10.404
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I'm... I'm the heavy.

12:10.536 --> 12:14.675
Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

12:14.807 --> 12:16.676
Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i>
for example.

12:16.810 --> 12:18.310
- Mm-hm.
- Right?

12:18.445 --> 12:21.315
So you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

12:21.448 --> 12:24.483
You wanna build up
his bona fides, right?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.820
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show

12:26.954 --> 12:28.488
- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.757
Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

12:31.892 --> 12:33.694
it's hero besting heavy.

12:33.826 --> 12:36.329
But what the audience sees

12:36.463 --> 12:41.334
is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

12:41.468 --> 12:43.002
- Uh-huh.
- You see?

12:43.136 --> 12:46.406
Then next week,
it's Ron Ely.

12:46.539 --> 12:49.876
And next week,
it's Bob Conrad,

12:50.009 --> 12:52.912
wearing his tight pants,
kicking your ass.

12:53.046 --> 12:55.315
Yeah.

12:55.448 --> 12:57.983
Now, in another couple of years,
playing punching bag

12:58.118 --> 13:01.188
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

13:01.320 --> 13:03.322
that's gonna have
a psychological effect

13:03.455 --> 13:06.859
on how the audience
perceives you.

13:06.993 --> 13:08.427
Right.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.397
So, Rick,

13:10.530 --> 13:13.334
who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?

13:13.467 --> 13:16.403
Mannix?
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

13:16.536 --> 13:18.470
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

13:18.604 --> 13:20.807
How about
Batman and Robin?

13:20.940 --> 13:22.541
Ping. Pow.

13:22.675 --> 13:24.545
Choom. Zoom.

13:26.647 --> 13:27.915
Down goes you.

13:28.047 --> 13:31.551
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

13:33.186 --> 13:39.325
Or do you go to Rome
and star in Westerns

13:39.459 --> 13:42.329
and win fucking fights?

13:48.868 --> 13:50.403
Ticket, señor?

13:58.078 --> 14:00.147
All right,
what's the matter, partner?

14:00.280 --> 14:02.616
Well...

14:02.749 --> 14:06.285
it's official, old buddy.
I'm a has-been.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.988
What are you talking about?
What did that guy tell you?

14:09.122 --> 14:11.458
He told me the goddamn truth,
is what he told me.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.762
- Oh. Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.564
- Hey.
- I'm sorry about that.

14:17.698 --> 14:18.565
Sorry about that.

14:18.699 --> 14:20.367
Here. Put these on.

14:20.499 --> 14:22.068
Don't cry
in front of the Mexicans.

14:22.201 --> 14:24.971
- Son of a bitch.
- What's got you so upset, man?

14:25.104 --> 14:27.373
Well, if coming face-to-face
with the failure

14:27.507 --> 14:29.575
that is your career
ain't worth crying about,

14:29.709 --> 14:31.310
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

14:31.445 --> 14:33.379
Right. That guy in there
turn you down?

14:33.512 --> 14:36.483
No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

14:36.616 --> 14:38.318
Then what's the problem?

14:38.450 --> 14:40.119
I gotta do
Italian goddamn movies!

14:40.253 --> 14:41.954
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.059
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't
matter whether I cry in public.

14:45.191 --> 14:47.360
Nobody remembers
who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

14:47.493 --> 14:49.362
<i>...at the Hall of Justice here.</i>

14:49.496 --> 14:51.965
<i>The defense will try

14:52.099 --> 14:53.834
- <i>was the product of a sick mind.</i>
- Fuck!

14:53.967 --> 14:56.502
- Thank you. Hey, let's go.
- Take me home, Cliff.

14:56.636 --> 14:58.272
Come on, take me home.

16:16.215 --> 16:20.219
And now a race
to the bottom. Heh.

16:20.353 --> 16:22.555
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of,

16:22.689 --> 16:25.825
so I can't say I really know
how you feel.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.328
What are you talking about?
You're my stunt double.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.930
Come on, now. Shit.

16:30.063 --> 16:33.433
Rick, I'm your driver, man.
I'm-I'm your gofer.

16:33.565 --> 16:36.103
I'm not complaining, man.
I like driving you around.

16:36.235 --> 16:37.870
I like doing shit
around the house

16:38.003 --> 16:39.839
and house-sitting
in the Hollywood Hills

16:39.973 --> 16:42.275
when you're gone.

16:42.408 --> 16:44.210
But I haven't been
a full-time stuntman

16:44.344 --> 16:45.911
for a while now,

16:46.046 --> 16:47.680
and from where I'm standing,

16:47.814 --> 16:49.916
going to Rome to star
in movies does not sound

16:50.050 --> 16:52.886
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

16:53.018 --> 16:57.222
Come on, now. You ever seen
an-an Italian Western, huh?

16:57.357 --> 16:59.425
They're awful.
It's a fucking farce.

16:59.559 --> 17:02.060
Yeah, how many you seen?
One? Two?

17:02.195 --> 17:05.265
I've seen enough, all right?
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.991
Oh, hell, man,
stay in L.A.

18:04.123 --> 18:05.691
Give it what fer
next pilot season.

18:05.825 --> 18:07.960
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

18:08.094 --> 18:11.198
I'm too insecure now
to score come pilot season.

18:11.331 --> 18:14.168
Screen Gems ain't gonna have
nothing good to say about me.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.202
- You know that.
- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

18:16.334 --> 18:18.537
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season.

18:18.671 --> 18:20.073
- No matter what I do...
- Ah...

18:20.207 --> 18:22.007
...I'm always gonna be
the horse's ass

18:22.142 --> 18:23.743
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> canceled

18:23.876 --> 18:27.646
because I wanted some fucking
rinky-dink movie career.

18:29.248 --> 18:32.117
- Tom. My friend.
- I met him?

18:32.251 --> 18:33.519
No, you haven't met him.

18:33.652 --> 18:35.488
You won't meet him
because I don't think

18:35.621 --> 18:36.523
- you'd like him.
- Why?

18:36.655 --> 18:38.157
Well...

18:40.325 --> 18:43.863
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

18:58.074 --> 18:59.045
Holy shit. Heh.

18:59.178 --> 19:01.581
That was Polanski.

19:01.715 --> 19:03.216
That was Roman Polanski.

19:03.348 --> 19:05.584
He's lived there
for a month now.

19:05.719 --> 19:08.087
First time I seen him.
Ha-ha-ha.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.190
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

19:13.325 --> 19:14.427
What do I always say?

19:14.561 --> 19:16.263
Most important thing
in this town is,

19:16.395 --> 19:18.731
when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.

19:18.864 --> 19:21.433
You don't rent.
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.636
Hollywood real estate
means you live here.

19:23.769 --> 19:27.172
You're not just visiting,
not just passing through.

19:27.306 --> 19:29.342
You fucking live here.

19:29.475 --> 19:31.044
Here I am flat
on my ass,

19:31.178 --> 19:33.213
and who I got living
next door to me?

19:33.345 --> 19:36.214
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i>
fucking <i>Baby,</i> that's who.

19:36.348 --> 19:38.617
Polanski, the hottest director
in town right now,

19:38.751 --> 19:40.018
probably the world.

19:40.152 --> 19:42.122
He's my next-door neighbor.

19:42.255 --> 19:45.190
I mean, shit. I mean,
who knows what could happen?

19:45.325 --> 19:47.861
I could... I could be
one pool party away

19:47.995 --> 19:49.896
f-from starring
in a new Polanski movie.

19:50.028 --> 19:51.363
So you're feeling better
now?

19:51.498 --> 19:53.266
Aw, yeah, yeah.
Sorry about all that.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.067
Give me my glasses back.

19:55.201 --> 19:57.135
Oh, come get them, fucker.
Come...

19:57.269 --> 19:59.471
All right, all right,
Audie Murphy, relax.

19:59.605 --> 20:01.974
- There you go.
- You need me for anything else?

20:02.109 --> 20:04.944
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot
of lines to learn for tomorrow.

20:05.076 --> 20:06.278
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

20:06.411 --> 20:07.913
I'm gonna get my carcass
on home.

20:08.046 --> 20:09.981
- All right.
- All right, 7:15 a.m.

20:10.115 --> 20:11.785
- Seven-fifteen.
- Out the door.

20:11.918 --> 20:13.253
- Out the door.
- In the car.

20:13.385 --> 20:14.420
All right,
see you then.

23:06.758 --> 23:09.627
Hello, coming in. Hello.

23:09.761 --> 23:11.630
Hello, darling. Hello.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.934
Mm. Mm.

23:14.066 --> 23:15.701
Come here.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.836
Hello, sweetheart.

23:17.969 --> 23:21.274
Mm. How was your day?
Hmm?

23:21.408 --> 23:23.176
Wait till you see
what I got for you.

23:23.309 --> 23:26.611
Wait until you see
what I got for you.

23:26.746 --> 23:28.714
Look what I got for you.

23:28.847 --> 23:30.315
Gonna blow your mind, man.

23:34.487 --> 23:36.456
Come here. Come here.

23:38.658 --> 23:41.594
Ta, ta, ta. Oh!

24:41.487 --> 24:43.022
Was that a whine?

24:44.457 --> 24:45.991
What did I tell you
about whining?

24:46.124 --> 24:47.493
You whine, you don't eat.

24:47.626 --> 24:49.327
I will throw this shit
in the trash.

24:49.461 --> 24:50.863
I don't wanna, but I will.

24:52.297 --> 24:53.164
You understand?

24:53.298 --> 24:55.867
All right.

25:31.304 --> 25:33.773
<i>I waited at
the bar till closing time,</i>

25:33.907 --> 25:36.442
<i>but he never came back.</i>

25:36.575 --> 25:38.844
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

25:38.978 --> 25:41.613
<i>I don't know.
Everything was fine.</i>

25:41.748 --> 25:43.382
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

25:43.516 --> 25:44.950
<i>And afterwards, you know,</i>

25:45.084 --> 25:46.885
- <i>while I was doing the dishes,</i>
- Tsk, tsk.

25:47.019 --> 25:49.320
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

25:49.455 --> 25:51.491
<i>And then, at the club,
Gabe was doing great.</i>

25:51.623 --> 25:53.726
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

25:53.860 --> 25:57.263
<i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i>

25:57.396 --> 25:59.298
- <i>Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.

26:05.304 --> 26:09.675
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal
tape starting in five, four,</i>

26:09.808 --> 26:12.377
<i>three, two, one.</i>

26:12.511 --> 26:16.815
Pepe, get your behind
behind that bar! I got a guest.

26:16.949 --> 26:18.383
<i>Johnny says...</i>

26:18.517 --> 26:21.554
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

26:21.688 --> 26:22.988
<i>How's the beans?</i>

26:23.122 --> 26:24.157
I've had worse.

26:25.857 --> 26:28.326
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

26:28.459 --> 26:29.961
<i>A toast.</i>

26:30.095 --> 26:32.463
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

26:32.597 --> 26:35.166
May they never meet.

26:35.301 --> 26:37.803
Señor Madrid,
care to join me at my table

26:37.937 --> 26:40.805
where I entertain my guests?

26:40.940 --> 26:44.009
<i>I would be
delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

26:45.644 --> 26:48.381
Take the bottle with you.

26:48.514 --> 26:50.549
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

26:50.682 --> 26:53.018
Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours

26:53.151 --> 26:54.520
with the fiddle?

26:54.653 --> 26:56.488
<i>She's asleep.</i>

26:56.622 --> 26:58.690
Well, wake her the heck up,
get her down here

26:58.824 --> 27:01.861
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guests.

27:01.994 --> 27:04.530
<i>Sí, señor,
but please don't hurt her this time,</i>

27:04.663 --> 27:05.631
<i>I beg you.</i>

27:05.765 --> 27:07.232
I ain't gonna hurt her.

27:07.365 --> 27:09.134
Just want her
to play the fiddle.

27:09.267 --> 27:10.869
Fetch her and tell her
I'll give her

27:11.003 --> 27:12.238
a fat $5 gold piece,

27:12.372 --> 27:15.274
she play her little chili pepper
heart out.

27:15.407 --> 27:18.344
So, Johnny, what else
you heard about me?

27:18.478 --> 27:21.246
<i>I heard you're
pushing Lancer pretty hard,</i>

27:21.380 --> 27:23.116
<i>but Lancer has money.</i>

27:23.248 --> 27:27.754
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.</i>

27:29.855 --> 27:31.257
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

27:31.390 --> 27:33.559
I'll open the door for you.

27:33.692 --> 27:35.294
You look good.

27:47.907 --> 27:49.509
I think Steve's
gonna be there too.

27:49.642 --> 27:50.610
Oh, yeah.

29:04.749 --> 29:06.819
Oh, look. They're here.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.337
Welcome to the Playboy
Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

29:24.469 --> 29:27.472
Hey, how are you doing,
baby?

29:27.605 --> 29:30.375
Hey! Heh. How are you?

29:43.322 --> 29:45.558
Oh, Cass!

29:57.335 --> 29:59.072
Yeah!

30:04.543 --> 30:05.879
Yeah, baby!

30:08.646 --> 30:11.650
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

30:20.559 --> 30:22.060
Oh, yeah.

30:54.860 --> 30:57.863
I'm gonna tell you a story.

30:57.997 --> 31:00.733
She was engaged to him.

31:03.902 --> 31:09.976
Then she flew
to the UK...

31:10.109 --> 31:12.276
to make a film
with him,

31:12.411 --> 31:17.950
and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.

31:19.384 --> 31:23.088
Then they moved
to Los Angeles,

31:23.221 --> 31:25.289
and the three of them

31:25.423 --> 31:27.258
have been inseparable.

31:27.392 --> 31:29.629
Really?

31:31.162 --> 31:32.832
What's up?

31:34.499 --> 31:37.869
Jay loves Sharon,
that's what's up.

31:38.003 --> 31:41.040
- Mm.
- And he knows...

31:41.172 --> 31:44.443
as sure as God made
little green apples...

31:46.011 --> 31:48.013
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's

31:48.146 --> 31:49.448
gonna fuck things up,

31:49.582 --> 31:52.818
and when he does,
Jay's gonna be there.

31:52.950 --> 31:55.187
Well, one thing's
for sure.

31:55.321 --> 31:56.988
Yeah?

31:57.123 --> 31:58.323
What's that?

31:58.457 --> 32:01.960
Sharon absolutely has a type.

32:03.094 --> 32:05.331
Cute, short, talented guys

32:05.463 --> 32:08.267
who look
like 12-year-old boys.

32:08.401 --> 32:10.202
Yeah.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.142
I never stood a chance.

32:54.345 --> 32:56.449
Argh. Fuck you,
Dr. Sapirstein.

33:41.058 --> 33:42.594
Oh, here we are.

33:45.130 --> 33:49.501
Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!

33:49.634 --> 33:52.137
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

33:52.270 --> 33:53.138
Go ahead.

33:56.642 --> 33:58.510
You can talk to him.
Just talk to him.

33:58.643 --> 34:00.645
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

34:00.778 --> 34:04.450
Ahem. I think the wind blew
down my TV antenna last night,

34:04.583 --> 34:07.286
so while I piss-fart
around with wardrobe,

34:07.419 --> 34:08.955
you mind going home
and fixing it?

34:09.087 --> 34:11.922
I can. You talk to
the stunt gaffer about me today?

34:12.056 --> 34:14.426
That way I'll know
if I'm working this week or not.

34:14.558 --> 34:16.726
Yeah. Ahem.
I've been meaning to tell you.

34:16.860 --> 34:20.965
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

34:21.100 --> 34:22.634
the gaffer
from <i>The Green Hornet...</i>

34:22.768 --> 34:25.004
...so there ain't no point.

34:25.136 --> 34:27.505
If you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.

34:27.638 --> 34:29.841
I don't need you. Not today.

34:29.975 --> 34:33.812
Go home, fix my antenna,
do whatever. See you at wrap.

34:36.482 --> 34:38.550
Hey!

34:38.683 --> 34:41.853
You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.

34:51.996 --> 34:53.132
Hey, hey.

34:53.264 --> 34:54.565
Hey, buddy,
I'm Rick Dalton.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.234
You know
where I'm supposed to go?

34:56.368 --> 34:58.504
They're waiting for you
in the makeup trailer.

34:58.636 --> 35:00.339
Where's the makeup trailer?

35:00.471 --> 35:02.542
Straight back the way you came,
hard right.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.549
Oh, my God.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.721
Rick Dalton.

35:16.855 --> 35:18.122
Sam Wanamaker.

35:18.256 --> 35:19.724
Hey, Sam.

35:19.857 --> 35:20.993
Sorry about the wet hand.

35:21.127 --> 35:22.995
Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it with Yul.

35:23.127 --> 35:25.529
I want you to know,
I'm the one who cast you.

35:25.663 --> 35:28.334
And I couldn't be more
delighted you're doing this.

35:28.466 --> 35:29.633
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

35:29.768 --> 35:32.204
I... I appreciate it.
It's a good part.

35:32.337 --> 35:35.240
Yeah, it is. Have you met
Jim Stacy, the series lead?

35:35.373 --> 35:36.676
Uh, not yet, no. No.

35:36.808 --> 35:39.544
Well, you guys are going
to be dynamite together.

35:39.678 --> 35:40.613
Mm. Mm.

35:40.745 --> 35:43.047
Well, it sounds exciting.

35:43.181 --> 35:45.216
- Yeah, lightning in a bottle.
- Mm.

35:45.350 --> 35:47.453
Now, you met Sonya,
makeup and hair?

35:47.585 --> 35:48.752
Hi.

35:48.886 --> 35:50.855
And this is Rebekka,
who does costumes.

35:50.989 --> 35:52.390
Hello.

35:52.524 --> 35:53.859
- Hi.
- Howdy.

35:53.991 --> 35:55.727
I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

35:55.861 --> 35:57.395
I don't want this
Western costumed

35:57.529 --> 35:59.131
the way they costumed
<i>The Big Valley</i>

35:59.263 --> 36:00.966
and <i>Bonanza</i>
for the last decade.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.703
I want a zeitgeist flair
to the costumes.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.771
I mean,
nothing anachronistic,

36:06.904 --> 36:11.109
but where does 1869
and 1969 meet?

36:11.243 --> 36:13.777
Especially when it comes
to you, Caleb.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.247
Mm. Mm.

36:15.379 --> 36:17.248
First off,
I want to give him a mustache.

36:17.381 --> 36:21.953
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

36:22.087 --> 36:24.089
Now, about his jacket.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.958
I want to give him
a hippie jacket.

36:26.091 --> 36:28.460
Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

36:28.593 --> 36:30.562
and look like the hippest guy
in the room.

36:30.696 --> 36:32.864
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket.

36:32.997 --> 36:34.565
Fringes all down the arm.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.468
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

36:37.602 --> 36:39.571
he could hit the Strip in it
tonight.

36:39.705 --> 36:41.672
That's my girl. Heh.

36:41.806 --> 36:44.643
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

36:44.776 --> 36:46.611
I want to go
with a different hairstyle.

36:46.745 --> 36:47.779
Huh. What?

36:47.913 --> 36:50.516
Something
more hippie-ish.

36:50.649 --> 36:53.918
You want me
to look like a hippie?

36:54.053 --> 36:57.022
Well, think less hippie,
more...

36:57.154 --> 36:58.189
Hells Angel!

37:00.960 --> 37:02.761
- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...

37:02.893 --> 37:05.663
Sam. Sam, uh...

37:05.797 --> 37:07.665
if you got me covered up
in all this...

37:07.799 --> 37:10.100
this junk, uh,

37:10.234 --> 37:12.003
how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

37:13.103 --> 37:14.172
I hope they don't.

37:14.306 --> 37:15.507
Mm.

37:15.640 --> 37:20.011
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

37:20.145 --> 37:22.980
I want them to see Caleb.

37:23.114 --> 37:25.917
I hired you
to be an actor, Rick.

37:26.051 --> 37:29.188
Not a TV cowboy.
You're better than that.

40:40.812 --> 40:44.549
<i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

40:44.683 --> 40:46.051
<i>he's best friends
with Randy,</i>

40:46.183 --> 40:47.718
<i>the gaffer</i>
<i>from</i> The Green Hornet,

40:47.852 --> 40:50.188
<i>so there really
ain't no point.</i>

41:05.536 --> 41:06.772
Hey, Randy.

41:09.174 --> 41:11.076
Cliff.

41:11.209 --> 41:13.511
So you're still with Rick,
huh?

41:13.645 --> 41:14.547
Still here.

41:16.047 --> 41:16.915
He in there?

41:17.049 --> 41:19.084
Yeah. Just knock.

41:23.455 --> 41:26.257
Look, just put him
in the wardrobe, all right?

41:26.390 --> 41:27.491
What's it gonna hurt?

41:27.625 --> 41:29.227
Then if you need him,
you got him.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.996
But then I gotta have
a conversation

41:31.129 --> 41:32.697
with that
wardrobe assistant,

41:32.830 --> 41:35.599
- and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
- I just don't... Please, I...

41:35.734 --> 41:38.502
Look, Randy, I'm asking you
to help me out, man.

41:38.636 --> 41:40.339
If the answer's no,
the answer's no,

41:40.471 --> 41:42.940
not no with excuses.

41:43.073 --> 41:45.342
Hey, man.

41:45.475 --> 41:48.546
This ain't a fucking
Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

41:48.681 --> 41:51.416
I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes

41:51.549 --> 41:53.585
and sit around talking
to each other all day

41:53.718 --> 41:55.319
on the chance
that I might use them.

41:55.453 --> 41:56.955
I got a four-man team here,
Rick.

41:57.087 --> 41:59.423
If I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.993
And, you know,
I gotta look after my dudes.

42:02.127 --> 42:04.996
Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,

42:05.129 --> 42:06.564
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

42:06.698 --> 42:09.267
but-but that's not the case,
and you know it.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.469
- He's a great match for me.
- Yeah, no...

42:11.602 --> 42:13.604
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

42:13.738 --> 42:16.808
Throw him off a building, right?
Light him on fire.

42:16.942 --> 42:18.744
Hit him with
a fucking Lincoln, right?

42:18.877 --> 42:20.445
Get creative.
Do whatever you want.

42:20.578 --> 42:22.247
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

42:22.379 --> 42:24.415
- Rick.
- Yeah?

42:26.584 --> 42:28.486
I don't dig him.

42:30.122 --> 42:33.457
And I don't dig the vibe
he brings on a set.

42:33.591 --> 42:36.228
What, is there some old beef
between the two of you?

42:36.361 --> 42:38.629
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

42:38.763 --> 42:40.966
The dude killed
his fucking wife.

42:42.933 --> 42:46.238
Come on, man. You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

42:46.370 --> 42:47.972
Yes, Rick, I do.

42:48.105 --> 42:51.142
And I work with my wife,
and she believes it.

42:51.276 --> 42:53.444
She doesn't want
his creepy ass around.

42:55.781 --> 42:57.315
You know, this is probably

42:57.448 --> 42:59.651
the shittiest weather ever.

42:59.785 --> 43:02.886
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

43:03.020 --> 43:04.522
with the shittiest person.

43:06.424 --> 43:09.827
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser. He's a loser."

43:09.962 --> 43:11.896
They all said it,
"He's a fucking loser,"

43:12.029 --> 43:13.297
and I didn't believe them.

43:13.431 --> 43:16.368
So I guess
I'm the fucking idiot.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.136
And now you're not
gonna talk to me?

43:18.268 --> 43:20.537
What, you don't feel
like fighting?

43:20.672 --> 43:22.307
Well, I feel like
fucking fighting

43:22.439 --> 43:24.508
because I've been up here
by myself

43:24.643 --> 43:28.213
for four hours on this
fucking shithole of a boat.

43:28.346 --> 43:29.982
Yeah.

43:32.017 --> 43:35.319
H-he's a goddamn
war hero. Fuck.

43:37.654 --> 43:38.857
Yeah, appreciate it.

43:42.960 --> 43:48.167
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

43:50.835 --> 43:52.771
Now, I'll put you
in wardrobe,

43:52.904 --> 43:55.507
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

43:55.640 --> 43:58.544
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

43:58.676 --> 44:01.345
You know my wife Janet,
don't you?

44:01.478 --> 44:02.846
Yeah.

44:02.980 --> 44:05.183
Steer clear of her.

44:05.317 --> 44:08.520
Now, I admire
Cassius Clay, I do.

44:08.654 --> 44:10.889
What I admire is,
in his sport,

44:11.022 --> 44:13.257
there's an element
of true combat.

44:13.390 --> 44:15.927
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

44:16.060 --> 44:18.263
that's not two athletes
posturing.

44:18.397 --> 44:20.265
That's combat.

44:20.399 --> 44:23.567
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

44:23.701 --> 44:25.736
If you don't beat him...

44:25.870 --> 44:27.939
he kills you.

44:28.073 --> 44:29.674
That's beyond athletics.

44:29.808 --> 44:33.378
That's beyond
<i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

44:33.511 --> 44:35.379
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

44:35.513 --> 44:37.949
That's what I admire.

44:38.082 --> 44:39.417
In martial arts tournaments,

44:39.551 --> 44:41.119
they won't let you fight
like that.

44:41.252 --> 44:43.254
It's very frustrating.

44:43.388 --> 44:44.689
You stand in front of a guy,

44:44.823 --> 44:47.625
and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

44:47.759 --> 44:49.294
But you can't.

44:49.426 --> 44:53.363
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

44:53.497 --> 44:56.600
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

44:56.734 --> 44:57.803
The colored boxer,

44:57.935 --> 44:59.604
not that white
kickboxing asshole.

45:00.939 --> 45:03.642
They do what
they need to do to win.

45:03.774 --> 45:05.676
They unleash
as much punishment

45:05.810 --> 45:08.146
as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

45:09.314 --> 45:10.949
But in martial arts
tournaments,

45:11.082 --> 45:13.451
I do to win what
they do to win.

45:13.585 --> 45:16.488
I unleash all my power.

45:17.254 --> 45:18.922
I kill people.

45:19.056 --> 45:21.160
If you fought Cassius
Clay, who would win?

45:21.292 --> 45:23.961
Well,
that would never happen.

45:24.094 --> 45:26.598
But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

45:27.799 --> 45:29.134
I'd make him a cripple.

45:32.437 --> 45:35.272
Hey, you. What's your name?

45:35.406 --> 45:37.809
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

45:39.109 --> 45:40.644
My name's Cliff.

45:40.779 --> 45:42.781
I'm Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

45:42.913 --> 45:45.517
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

45:45.649 --> 45:48.151
You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

45:48.285 --> 45:50.021
That's what they tell me.

45:50.154 --> 45:54.024
So did I say something
funny, stuntman?

45:54.158 --> 45:57.194
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

45:57.328 --> 45:59.330
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

45:59.464 --> 46:00.864
I'm just here
to do a job.

46:00.998 --> 46:02.801
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying.

46:02.933 --> 46:04.468
But I'm not saying
anything funny.

46:04.602 --> 46:06.904
So, what do you think
is so funny?

46:08.205 --> 46:10.341
What I think is...

46:12.542 --> 46:15.078
you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

46:15.212 --> 46:16.915
and I think you
should be embarrassed

46:17.047 --> 46:19.183
to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

46:19.317 --> 46:22.086
on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

46:22.219 --> 46:25.055
Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

46:25.189 --> 46:26.857
And I would really
enjoy closing it,

46:26.991 --> 46:29.993
especially in front
of all my friends.

46:30.127 --> 46:33.464
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

46:33.598 --> 46:35.866
That means,
we get into a fight,

46:36.000 --> 46:39.903
I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

46:40.038 --> 46:41.639
Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

46:41.772 --> 46:43.040
in a fight,
they go to jail.

46:43.174 --> 46:44.576
It's called
manslaughter.

46:44.709 --> 46:46.844
And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

46:46.977 --> 46:48.479
is just an excuse
so you dancers

46:48.613 --> 46:50.748
never have to get
in a real fight.

46:51.982 --> 46:52.884
Okay.

46:54.118 --> 46:55.921
How about
a friendly contest?

46:57.154 --> 46:59.056
No punching in the face.

46:59.190 --> 47:00.725
Two out of three.

47:00.859 --> 47:02.860
Who puts who
on the ground first?

47:02.993 --> 47:07.865
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

47:11.669 --> 47:14.138
That's a great idea, Kato.

47:25.783 --> 47:27.785
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kind of famous.

47:27.919 --> 47:29.421
That guy?

47:29.553 --> 47:30.921
For what?

47:31.056 --> 47:33.425
Killed his wife
and got away with it.

47:33.558 --> 47:34.693
That guy?

47:34.826 --> 47:36.361
That guy.

48:00.951 --> 48:02.286
Not bad, Kato.

48:03.620 --> 48:05.423
Try that again.

48:46.497 --> 48:48.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:48.966 --> 48:50.701
What the fuck
is going on here?

48:50.835 --> 48:53.939
Hey, jackass,
this is our series lead.

48:54.071 --> 48:55.640
What the fuck
are you thinking?

48:55.772 --> 48:57.975
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

48:58.109 --> 49:00.678
Don't fucking "Janet" me,
you prick.

49:00.812 --> 49:03.014
Hey.
What's up, babe?

49:03.147 --> 49:06.484
What's up, Randy,
is that your loser asshole,

49:06.616 --> 49:09.821
wife-killing buddy boy here was
beating the shit out of Bruce.

49:09.953 --> 49:11.354
What?

49:11.489 --> 49:13.492
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

49:13.625 --> 49:15.360
What the fuck, man?

49:15.493 --> 49:18.930
Let me just say, nobody beat
the shit out of Bruce.

49:19.064 --> 49:21.332
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

49:21.466 --> 49:24.036
I think that dent in the car
says something different.

49:25.703 --> 49:27.906
Oh, my God!

49:28.038 --> 49:30.440
What the fuck
did you do to my car?!

49:30.575 --> 49:32.710
What the fuck
did you do to her car?

49:32.843 --> 49:34.812
I threw this
little prick into it,

49:34.946 --> 49:36.881
but I did not know
it was her car.

49:37.013 --> 49:41.484
Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!

49:41.618 --> 49:42.553
- Janet!
- What?

49:42.687 --> 49:43.755
I will handle this.

49:43.888 --> 49:45.489
Then fucking handle it,
Randy.

49:46.991 --> 49:47.893
Cliff...

49:49.160 --> 49:52.263
get the wardrobe off,
get your shit,

49:52.397 --> 49:54.099
and get off the lot.

49:57.134 --> 49:58.536
Fair enough.

50:32.803 --> 50:35.238
Aw. What's the matter?

50:35.372 --> 50:39.209
Are you afraid I'll tell
Jim Morrison you were dancing

50:39.343 --> 50:41.645
to Paul Revere
and the Raiders?

50:41.779 --> 50:43.648
Are they not
cool enough for you?

50:53.256 --> 50:55.759
Who's this
shaggy asshole?

50:57.460 --> 50:58.796
Hello? Can I help you?

50:58.928 --> 51:01.631
Oh, yeah. Hey, man.
I'm looking for Terry.

51:01.765 --> 51:04.801
I'm a friend of Terry's
and Dennis Wilson's.

51:04.935 --> 51:07.072
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

51:07.205 --> 51:08.806
This is the Polanski
residence now.

51:08.939 --> 51:11.276
Really? He moved?

51:11.908 --> 51:12.810
Dang.

51:14.145 --> 51:15.979
Uh, you know...?
You know where?

51:16.114 --> 51:18.382
I'm not sure,
but the owner of the property,

51:18.517 --> 51:21.386
Paul, might.
He's in the guest house.

51:21.518 --> 51:22.986
Who is it, Jay?

51:23.120 --> 51:26.557
It's okay, honey.
It's a friend of Terry's.

51:26.690 --> 51:28.792
Yeah, just take
the back path.

51:28.926 --> 51:30.061
Thank you kindly.

51:32.196 --> 51:33.531
Ma'am.

51:49.413 --> 51:51.682
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

51:51.815 --> 51:53.384
I know they just
broke for lunch,

51:53.518 --> 51:56.220
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

51:56.353 --> 51:59.022
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

51:59.156 --> 52:03.460
I got my book. Say, say,
where's the bad-guy saloon?

52:03.593 --> 52:05.696
You just go straight
through the Western town,

52:05.830 --> 52:08.299
take a right and a left,
and you see it right there.

52:08.433 --> 52:11.035
Thanks, honey.

52:12.404 --> 52:14.406
Can we move to number two?

52:14.538 --> 52:16.006
How is his bounce?

52:16.140 --> 52:17.740
Can I get a bounce there?

52:17.875 --> 52:20.377
Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.

52:20.511 --> 52:21.713
Just make it a quick one.

52:23.047 --> 52:25.584
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

53:11.261 --> 53:12.596
Hello.

53:14.931 --> 53:15.834
Hello.

53:18.602 --> 53:19.937
Hello.

53:22.107 --> 53:23.306
Would...

53:23.440 --> 53:25.142
Would it bother you
if I sat

53:25.276 --> 53:27.279
next to you
and read my book too?

53:29.614 --> 53:31.149
I don't know.

53:32.082 --> 53:34.151
Would you bother me?

53:34.285 --> 53:35.754
I'll try not to.

53:39.156 --> 53:40.292
Sit.

54:25.303 --> 54:26.304
Ah.

54:27.538 --> 54:31.375
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Ahem.

54:36.714 --> 54:37.982
You don't eat lunch?

54:39.350 --> 54:41.518
I've got a scene
after lunch.

54:41.652 --> 54:42.654
Yeah?

54:44.288 --> 54:47.558
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

54:47.692 --> 54:49.493
I believe it's the job
of an actor...

54:49.627 --> 54:51.728
And I say "actor,"
not "actress,"

54:51.863 --> 54:54.665
because the word "actress"
is nonsensical.

54:54.799 --> 54:57.035
It's the actor's job
to avoid

54:57.167 --> 54:59.202
impediments
to their performance.

54:59.335 --> 55:03.908
It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.

55:04.040 --> 55:08.145
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...

55:08.946 --> 55:10.381
that's meaningful.

55:11.783 --> 55:14.485
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

55:14.618 --> 55:17.520
Mar... Marabella what?

55:17.654 --> 55:19.122
Marabella Lancer.

55:19.256 --> 55:22.526
No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?

55:24.661 --> 55:26.631
When we're on set,
I'd prefer to only

55:26.763 --> 55:28.698
be referred to
by my character's name.

55:28.832 --> 55:31.935
It helps me invest
in the reality of the story.

55:32.069 --> 55:34.238
I've tried it both ways,
and I'm always just

55:34.372 --> 55:36.574
a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

55:36.707 --> 55:40.245
And if I can be
a tiny bit better, I want to be.

55:43.446 --> 55:46.417
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

55:50.087 --> 55:53.391
I thought it was
pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

55:53.524 --> 55:56.627
I'm pretty sure
it's "DeCoteau."

55:58.930 --> 56:00.732
- DeCoteau.
- Mm.

56:02.200 --> 56:05.035
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

56:06.270 --> 56:07.605
Hmm.

56:22.953 --> 56:24.288
What are you reading?

56:25.622 --> 56:28.091
It's a biography
on Walt Disney.

56:28.225 --> 56:29.792
It's fascinating.

56:29.926 --> 56:31.762
He's a genius, you know.

56:31.895 --> 56:35.265
I mean, a once-in-every-50
-or-100-years kind of genius.

56:35.399 --> 56:37.469
What are you, 12?

56:38.335 --> 56:39.504
I'm 8.

56:40.404 --> 56:42.172
What are you reading?

56:43.741 --> 56:44.976
Just a Western.

56:45.109 --> 56:48.045
What does that mean?
Is it good?

56:48.178 --> 56:51.149
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

56:52.582 --> 56:54.285
I haven't finished
it yet.

56:54.417 --> 56:57.520
I didn't ask
for the whole story.

56:57.654 --> 56:59.357
What's the idea
of the story?

57:00.792 --> 57:02.259
Well... ahem,

57:02.393 --> 57:05.463
it's about this guy
who's a bronco buster.

57:06.663 --> 57:08.632
It's the story
of his life.

57:09.966 --> 57:11.768
Guy's name
is Tom Breezy,

57:11.902 --> 57:14.939
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

57:15.071 --> 57:17.642
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s

57:17.774 --> 57:20.777
and-and-and young and
good-looking, he could...

57:20.910 --> 57:24.147
He could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

57:24.281 --> 57:27.183
Back then,
he just had a way.

57:27.317 --> 57:30.587
Now he's into
his, uh, late 30s

57:30.721 --> 57:33.324
and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

57:33.457 --> 57:35.859
He's not... He's not...
He's not crippled

57:35.993 --> 57:38.328
or anything like that, but...

57:38.462 --> 57:40.431
But he's got
spine problems

57:40.564 --> 57:43.233
he never had before,
and he spends, uh...

57:44.734 --> 57:48.404
more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.

57:48.538 --> 57:51.441
Jeepers, this sounds
like a good novel.

57:52.375 --> 57:54.211
Yeah, it's not bad.

57:55.212 --> 57:56.914
Where are you in it?

57:57.047 --> 57:59.250
Mm. About midway.

58:00.618 --> 58:03.821
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

58:03.955 --> 58:06.424
Uh, he's, um...
He...

58:07.825 --> 58:09.593
He's not the best
anymore.

58:10.861 --> 58:12.729
In fact,
far from it. And...

58:14.631 --> 58:18.569
he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...

58:21.372 --> 58:22.906
use...

58:30.681 --> 58:34.953
Slightly more useless
each day.

58:50.433 --> 58:52.303
I-it's okay, Caleb.

58:52.435 --> 58:53.970
It's okay.

58:54.105 --> 58:56.540
It sounds like
a really sad book.

58:56.672 --> 58:58.575
Poor Easy Breezy.

58:58.709 --> 59:01.145
I'm practically crying,
and I haven't even read it.

59:03.214 --> 59:05.116
About 15 years,
you'll be living it.

59:05.248 --> 59:06.551
What?

59:09.919 --> 59:12.656
Nothing, pumpkin puss.
I'm just...

59:13.723 --> 59:15.158
I'm just teasing you.

59:16.527 --> 59:18.329
You know something? You...

59:19.730 --> 59:22.498
You might be right
about this book.

59:22.632 --> 59:25.837
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

59:27.672 --> 59:30.975
I don't like names
like "pumpkin puss,"

59:31.975 --> 59:33.943
but since you're upset,

59:34.078 --> 59:36.014
we'll talk about that
some other time.

01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:33.036
I'm only going as far
as Westwood Village.

01:00:33.169 --> 01:00:34.837
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers.

01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:35.872
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

01:00:56.493 --> 01:00:58.129
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

01:00:59.529 --> 01:01:01.332
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

01:01:01.464 --> 01:01:03.834
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

01:01:03.966 --> 01:01:05.169
- Take care.
- You too.

01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:14.105
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

01:02:14.238 --> 01:02:16.806
How can I help you,
young lady?

01:02:16.939 --> 01:02:19.175
Oh.

01:02:19.308 --> 01:02:21.011
I'm here to pick up
a first edition

01:02:21.145 --> 01:02:23.681
of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess</i>
<i>of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

01:02:23.814 --> 01:02:24.980
It's under Polanski.

01:02:25.114 --> 01:02:26.850
Yeah, you're talking books
there, kid.

01:02:26.984 --> 01:02:28.352
Oh, I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

01:02:28.484 --> 01:02:30.353
- Yeah. Oh, man.
- I just read it.

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:32.823
- I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.
- Mm.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:38.127
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

01:02:38.261 --> 01:02:40.797
Jim Stacy. This is my show.
Welcome aboard.

01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:42.665
We're real glad
to have a pro like you

01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:44.200
playing the heavy
on the pilot.

01:02:44.334 --> 01:02:46.703
And I gotta tell you,
I came damn close

01:02:46.837 --> 01:02:49.506
to being in <i>The Fourteen</i>
<i>Fists of McCluskey.</i>

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.808
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.509
Let me tell you, I...

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:54.845
I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

01:02:54.977 --> 01:02:56.645
Up until two weeks
before shooting,

01:02:56.779 --> 01:02:58.415
Fabian was in the part.

01:02:58.549 --> 01:03:01.152
Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a <i>Virginian.</i>

01:03:01.285 --> 01:03:02.486
That's how I got it, so...

01:03:02.618 --> 01:03:03.520
Ah.

01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:08.859
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:10.194
Was it true
you almost got

01:03:10.326 --> 01:03:12.029
the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

01:03:13.698 --> 01:03:16.700
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

01:03:16.832 --> 01:03:18.634
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

01:03:18.768 --> 01:03:21.370
Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

01:03:21.504 --> 01:03:22.806
Never met John Sturges.

01:03:22.939 --> 01:03:25.474
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:27.578
I almost got the part, but...

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:30.013
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

01:03:30.147 --> 01:03:32.415
I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:34.418
a hotshot pilot.

01:03:34.551 --> 01:03:38.622
But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

01:03:38.756 --> 01:03:41.558
McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:43.193
and during that
brief moment,

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:45.529
I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:46.763
You have other plans?

01:03:46.897 --> 01:03:48.098
I haven't seen Berlin yet

01:03:48.232 --> 01:03:49.700
from the ground
or from the air,

01:03:49.832 --> 01:03:52.035
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:53.569
You and who?

01:03:53.703 --> 01:03:56.873
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

01:03:57.006 --> 01:03:58.475
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

01:03:58.609 --> 01:04:00.110
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

01:04:00.243 --> 01:04:01.478
That's gotta hurt.

01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:03.646
Yeah, well,
I didn't get it,

01:04:03.779 --> 01:04:05.082
McQueen did it,

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:07.585
and, frankly,
I never had a chance.

01:04:09.152 --> 01:04:11.855
Ten days isolation,
Hilts.

01:04:11.989 --> 01:04:13.057
Captain Hilts.

01:04:13.189 --> 01:04:14.958
Twenty days.

01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:16.026
Right.

01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:20.196
Oh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

01:04:21.564 --> 01:04:23.200
Cooler.

01:05:18.388 --> 01:05:21.124
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

01:05:23.993 --> 01:05:26.462
What if I'm in the movie?

01:05:26.596 --> 01:05:28.165
What do you mean?

01:05:28.297 --> 01:05:30.868
I mean, I'm in the movie.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.468
I'm Sharon Tate.

01:05:32.602 --> 01:05:35.038
- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.

01:05:35.172 --> 01:05:37.308
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:39.776
That's me.

01:05:41.544 --> 01:05:44.214
But that's the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:49.886
Well, that's me, the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.655
Really?

01:05:51.788 --> 01:05:53.056
Really.

01:05:55.491 --> 01:05:57.894
Hey, Rubin!
Come out here.

01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:03.868
This is the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.035
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

01:06:06.169 --> 01:06:08.339
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.

01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:10.774
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

01:06:10.906 --> 01:06:13.809
- Oh.
- She's in this movie.

01:06:13.944 --> 01:06:15.512
- Oh.
- Sharon Tate.

01:06:15.645 --> 01:06:19.015
Well, welcome
to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

01:06:19.149 --> 01:06:20.749
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

01:06:20.884 --> 01:06:22.886
Would you like to come in
and see the show?

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:23.887
Could I?

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.221
By all means.

01:06:26.223 --> 01:06:27.158
Thank you.

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:31.027
Hey, can I get
a picture?

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.061
Oh, sure.

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:33.096
Okay.

01:06:37.366 --> 01:06:39.702
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster

01:06:39.837 --> 01:06:41.772
so people will know
who you are.

01:06:41.904 --> 01:06:44.140
Okay. Could you?

01:06:56.853 --> 01:06:58.321
Would you like
some refreshments?

01:06:58.455 --> 01:07:01.092
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

01:07:37.294 --> 01:07:39.629
<i>Can I ask
you a personal question?</i>

01:07:39.763 --> 01:07:41.998
- <i>I wish you would.</i>
- <i>How did a nice boy</i>

01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:44.967
<i>like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.969
<i>I turned to them
after I was rejected</i>

01:07:47.102 --> 01:07:49.172
<i>by the Daughters
of the American Revolution.</i>

01:08:11.627 --> 01:08:13.396
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

01:08:14.631 --> 01:08:16.166
- <i>Mr. Helm?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.367
<i>Oh!</i>

01:08:21.272 --> 01:08:22.706
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.175
<i>Welcome to Denmark,
Mr. Helm.</i>

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:29.011
<i>These are for you. Street maps,
places of interest.</i>

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:30.479
<i>This is for you too.</i>

01:08:32.247 --> 01:08:33.983
- <i>What year was that?</i>
- <i>1949.</i>

01:08:34.117 --> 01:08:35.785
<i>That's a very good year.</i>

01:08:35.919 --> 01:08:37.621
<i>I'm here to
help any way I can.</i>

01:08:37.754 --> 01:08:38.622
<i>Very nice of you.</i>

01:08:38.755 --> 01:08:39.622
<i>Is there anything</i>

01:08:39.755 --> 01:08:41.024
<i>you'd like me to do?</i>

01:08:41.157 --> 01:08:43.125
- <i>Yes, a couple things.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:08:43.259 --> 01:08:46.563
<i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i>

01:08:46.697 --> 01:08:48.332
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

01:08:48.465 --> 01:08:50.500
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
- <i>That's okay.</i>

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:51.602
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

01:08:53.069 --> 01:08:54.670
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

01:09:03.246 --> 01:09:06.247
<i>This is some kind of hotel
you've got here.</i>

01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:10.620
<i>Half a bottle
is better than none.</i>

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:22.098
Morning, partner.

01:09:22.232 --> 01:09:24.602
Probably come
by to see you later.

01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:00.470
That's far enough,
jughead.

01:10:01.304 --> 01:10:02.806
Name's not jughead.

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.343
What you doing
around here, boy?

01:10:06.475 --> 01:10:09.411
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon,
ain't it?

01:10:09.545 --> 01:10:12.614
Oh, yeah,
that's a saloon.

01:10:12.748 --> 01:10:15.286
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.624
Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:24.827
I know how bored
and restless you get

01:10:24.961 --> 01:10:26.930
when you run out of tamales.

01:10:28.732 --> 01:10:30.934
But, Mr. Gilbert,
if I was you,

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:34.904
I'd find out that
jughead's name.

01:10:36.372 --> 01:10:39.009
Allow me to introduce
the two of you.

01:10:40.743 --> 01:10:42.645
This here is Bob Gilbert.

01:10:43.813 --> 01:10:45.516
The Businessman?

01:10:45.648 --> 01:10:47.416
That's right.

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:51.888
Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?

01:10:52.022 --> 01:10:55.225
Well,
that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

01:10:56.093 --> 01:10:57.493
Johnny Madrid.

01:10:58.495 --> 01:11:00.397
Who's Johnny Madrid?

01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:08.304
He ain't from round here.

01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:10.473
No, really.

01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:11.675
Who is he, Caleb?

01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:18.215
Oh, you're about
to find out...

01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:21.050
Businessman.

01:11:38.835 --> 01:11:41.739
Ready when you are,
Gilbert.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.949
Johnny Madrid.

01:12:30.853 --> 01:12:32.623
How long has it been?

01:12:32.755 --> 01:12:36.225
Since that time in
Juárez, about three years ago.

01:12:36.358 --> 01:12:39.696
Well, come on in
and have a drink.

01:12:39.828 --> 01:12:42.198
Hell, in that case...

01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:46.603
buy you a drink, Caleb?

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:47.805
Sure, Johnny.

01:12:49.238 --> 01:12:51.808
How about some mezcal?

01:12:51.942 --> 01:12:53.777
Like that time in Juárez.

01:12:55.444 --> 01:12:57.813
A lot of people
died that day.

01:12:57.947 --> 01:12:59.415
Yes, they did.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.353
But we had a good time.

01:13:03.486 --> 01:13:04.587
Didn't we?

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.689
Yeah, we did.

01:13:07.823 --> 01:13:09.425
After you, DeCoteau.

01:13:10.894 --> 01:13:13.864
Pepe! Get your behind
behind that bar.

01:13:13.996 --> 01:13:15.698
I have a guest.

01:13:31.814 --> 01:13:33.149
How's the beans?

01:13:34.751 --> 01:13:36.119
I've had worse.

01:13:38.388 --> 01:13:40.457
One dollar.

01:13:43.425 --> 01:13:47.430
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

01:13:47.563 --> 01:13:49.632
May they never meet.

01:13:56.105 --> 01:13:59.675
Señor Madrid, you care
to join me at my table

01:13:59.809 --> 01:14:01.244
where I entertain
my guests?

01:14:01.376 --> 01:14:03.913
I'd be
delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

01:14:05.648 --> 01:14:07.584
Take the bottle
with you.

01:14:09.285 --> 01:14:11.220
So, Johnny, ahem...

01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:14.856
what brings you
to Arroyo del Oro?

01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:17.894
Oh, you know me,
Caleb.

01:14:18.027 --> 01:14:19.529
Money.

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:22.931
And who's paying
around here?

01:14:23.065 --> 01:14:24.533
I hope you.

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:26.435
Huh.

01:14:26.568 --> 01:14:28.937
And what have you
heard about me?

01:14:29.072 --> 01:14:30.907
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.209
All the cattle
you've appropriated.

01:14:33.343 --> 01:14:34.711
A lot of land,
a lot of cows,

01:14:34.844 --> 01:14:36.680
a lot of money,
no law to speak of,

01:14:36.813 --> 01:14:38.215
and nothing
but an old man

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:41.251
and some Mexican ranch hands
to shoo you off.

01:14:43.486 --> 01:14:45.689
Say, where's that
chili pepper

01:14:45.822 --> 01:14:48.091
daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:49.992
She's asleep.

01:14:50.126 --> 01:14:52.195
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

01:14:52.327 --> 01:14:55.831
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guest.

01:14:58.669 --> 01:15:00.871
But, please, don't hurt her
this time.

01:15:02.505 --> 01:15:03.973
I ain't gonna hurt her.

01:15:04.107 --> 01:15:07.810
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

01:15:11.281 --> 01:15:14.117
Line? "Go... Go fetch her
and tell her" what?

01:15:14.251 --> 01:15:15.752
"Go fetch her and tell her

01:15:15.885 --> 01:15:17.754
I'll give her a fat
$5 gold piece..."

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:19.322
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her

01:15:19.456 --> 01:15:21.291
I'll give her
a fat-fat $5 gold piece,

01:15:21.424 --> 01:15:23.760
she play her little
chili pepper heart out, right?

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.228
- Right.
- Got it.

01:15:31.434 --> 01:15:33.269
I ain't gonna hurt her.

01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:35.638
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.107
Now, go fetch her
and tell her

01:15:37.239 --> 01:15:38.774
I'll give her
a fat $5 gold piece,

01:15:38.907 --> 01:15:41.944
she play her little
chili pepper heart out.

01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:43.779
Go on.

01:15:48.117 --> 01:15:49.785
So, Johnny,

01:15:51.054 --> 01:15:52.654
what else you heard?

01:15:52.788 --> 01:15:54.256
Hmm.

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:56.925
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

01:15:57.059 --> 01:15:59.763
but Lancer's got money.

01:16:00.929 --> 01:16:02.965
At some point,

01:16:03.099 --> 01:16:05.368
he's gonna hire some guns

01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.536
and push back.

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:17.613
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:21.952
Maybe... Goddamn it!

01:16:22.085 --> 01:16:23.620
I fucked this
whole thing up, Sam.

01:16:23.754 --> 01:16:24.955
Keep going!

01:16:25.087 --> 01:16:26.355
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

01:16:26.488 --> 01:16:28.558
Can we just go back?
Please, can we just cut?

01:16:28.692 --> 01:16:30.026
Just say the fucking line!

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.594
No, really, Sam, please.

01:16:31.728 --> 01:16:33.196
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right!

01:16:33.328 --> 01:16:35.697
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

01:16:35.831 --> 01:16:36.799
All right, all right!

01:16:36.933 --> 01:16:38.201
Woo!

01:16:38.334 --> 01:16:40.370
You're a goddamn outlaw,
Rick. Come on, now.

01:16:40.502 --> 01:16:42.005
Woo!

01:16:42.138 --> 01:16:43.873
I got it. I got it.

01:16:45.241 --> 01:16:46.609
Go back a bit, would you?

01:16:46.742 --> 01:16:49.011
No, he's right. Back to one.

01:16:49.144 --> 01:16:51.513
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

01:16:51.647 --> 01:16:53.983
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

01:16:54.116 --> 01:16:55.051
I'm gonna use it.

01:16:57.153 --> 01:16:58.055
And...

01:16:59.154 --> 01:17:00.523
action.

01:17:03.425 --> 01:17:05.727
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

01:17:05.862 --> 01:17:08.364
but Lancer's got money.

01:17:09.532 --> 01:17:11.434
At some point,

01:17:11.568 --> 01:17:15.839
he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.

01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:22.077
Maybe he already has.

01:17:22.211 --> 01:17:24.714
Maybe.

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:29.085
Maybe
I don't like Lancer.

01:17:30.586 --> 01:17:32.388
Maybe I don't like
his boots.

01:17:34.056 --> 01:17:35.724
Maybe I don't like the way

01:17:35.858 --> 01:17:38.928
he uses those boots
to step on people.

01:17:42.564 --> 01:17:44.132
What the fuck was that?!

01:17:44.267 --> 01:17:46.702
Jesus Christ!

01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:48.037
Fuck!

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:50.372
Piece of shit.

01:17:50.506 --> 01:17:52.474
Fucking damn it, Rick,
I swear to God.

01:17:52.608 --> 01:17:54.811
Forgot your fucking lines,
embarrassed yourself

01:17:54.943 --> 01:17:57.145
like that in front of all
those goddamn people!

01:17:57.278 --> 01:18:00.248
You were drinking all night,
fucking drinking again,

01:18:00.382 --> 01:18:03.252
eight goddamn fucking
whiskey sours.

01:18:03.385 --> 01:18:06.455
Fucking bullshit.

01:18:08.491 --> 01:18:10.761
You're a fucking
miserable drunk.

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.196
Not fucking remembering
your fucking lines.

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:15.264
I practiced them,
and now I don't look

01:18:15.398 --> 01:18:17.033
like I goddamn practiced them!

01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:19.302
You're sitting there
like a fucking baboon!

01:18:21.403 --> 01:18:23.105
Fuck! Eight fucking
whiskey sours.

01:18:23.239 --> 01:18:26.209
I couldn't stop at fucking
three or four. I have eight!

01:18:26.343 --> 01:18:28.077
Why?! You're
a fucking alcoholic.

01:18:28.211 --> 01:18:29.913
You fucking drink
too much, huh?

01:18:30.045 --> 01:18:32.414
Every fucking night.
Every fucking night.

01:18:32.549 --> 01:18:34.149
That's it,
that's fucking it!

01:18:34.282 --> 01:18:35.550
That's fucking it.

01:18:35.684 --> 01:18:37.920
You stop drinking right now,
all right?

01:18:38.054 --> 01:18:39.322
Make a promise to yourself.

01:18:39.455 --> 01:18:41.558
You're gonna stop
fucking drinking.

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:42.725
Oh, fuck it.

01:18:46.429 --> 01:18:48.230
Damn it!

01:18:48.363 --> 01:18:50.065
You show that
little fucking girl.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.135
You're gonna show
that goddamn Jim Stacy.

01:18:52.268 --> 01:18:54.670
You're gonna show them
on that goddamn fucking set

01:18:54.804 --> 01:18:56.605
who the fuck
Rick Dalton is, all right?

01:18:56.738 --> 01:18:58.840
Let me tell you something.

01:18:58.974 --> 01:19:01.577
You don't get
these lines right,

01:19:01.711 --> 01:19:04.614
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out tonight.

01:19:04.747 --> 01:19:06.616
All right?
Your brains are gonna

01:19:06.748 --> 01:19:09.085
be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

01:19:09.219 --> 01:19:11.153
I mean it, motherfucker.

01:19:11.287 --> 01:19:12.555
Get your shit together.

01:20:18.787 --> 01:20:20.522
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

01:21:46.509 --> 01:21:47.510
Hey!

01:21:48.577 --> 01:21:49.479
Hi.

01:21:53.282 --> 01:21:54.683
Huh.

01:21:54.817 --> 01:21:56.819
Woo!

01:21:56.952 --> 01:21:58.154
Shit.

01:22:04.926 --> 01:22:07.330
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

01:22:07.462 --> 01:22:09.299
Oh, no.

01:22:24.679 --> 01:22:25.847
Hello, hot stuff.

01:22:25.982 --> 01:22:28.317
Looks like third time's
the charm.

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:30.319
Mm. How were those pickles?

01:22:33.622 --> 01:22:35.457
Real good.

01:22:35.591 --> 01:22:36.893
They were
the fancy kind.

01:22:37.026 --> 01:22:38.528
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:22:39.929 --> 01:22:41.163
Give me a lift?

01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:42.531
Where are you going?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.169
I'm going to Chatsworth.

01:22:46.301 --> 01:22:48.237
Chatsworth?

01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:51.073
You hitch up and down
Burbank Boulevard all day

01:22:51.206 --> 01:22:53.741
till someone says they'll
drive you to Chatsworth?

01:22:53.876 --> 01:22:55.512
Tourists love to drive me.

01:22:55.644 --> 01:22:57.846
I'm their favorite part
of their L.A. vacation.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:01.417
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:03.486
that they gave a ride
to the movie ranch

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.220
for the rest of their lives.

01:23:05.354 --> 01:23:06.756
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

01:23:08.123 --> 01:23:09.591
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going?

01:23:09.724 --> 01:23:10.658
Spahn Movie Ranch?

01:23:10.792 --> 01:23:11.827
Uh-huh.

01:23:11.961 --> 01:23:13.163
Why you going there?

01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:14.863
I live there.

01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:18.233
- Alone?
- No.

01:23:18.367 --> 01:23:19.669
Me and my friends.

01:23:21.104 --> 01:23:23.406
So you and a bunch
of friends like you

01:23:23.538 --> 01:23:25.375
all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

01:23:26.841 --> 01:23:27.743
Yeah.

01:23:30.078 --> 01:23:31.648
Well, hop in.
I'll take you there.

01:23:32.581 --> 01:23:33.783
Great!

01:23:43.259 --> 01:23:45.426
Go down here and get on
the Hollywood Freeway.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.996
I know where it is.

01:23:49.031 --> 01:23:52.301
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

01:23:52.434 --> 01:23:53.935
Whoa!

01:23:54.069 --> 01:23:55.571
What?

01:23:55.703 --> 01:23:57.072
I'm just surprised
how accurate

01:23:57.206 --> 01:23:58.940
that description
of me really is.

01:23:59.073 --> 01:24:02.411
Some old cowboy guy that used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

01:24:02.545 --> 01:24:06.015
So you used to make Westerns
at the ranch

01:24:06.148 --> 01:24:08.518
back in the old-timey days?

01:24:10.286 --> 01:24:12.855
Well, if by
"the old-timey days,"

01:24:12.987 --> 01:24:16.291
you mean television
eight years ago, yeah.

01:24:16.425 --> 01:24:17.760
Are you an actor?

01:24:17.894 --> 01:24:19.496
No, I'm a stuntman.

01:24:20.763 --> 01:24:22.431
You're a stuntman.

01:24:23.599 --> 01:24:25.735
That's way better.

01:24:25.868 --> 01:24:27.170
Why is that way better?

01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:30.607
- Actors are phony.
- Oh.

01:24:30.739 --> 01:24:32.808
They just say lines
that other people write

01:24:32.942 --> 01:24:36.612
and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.

01:24:36.745 --> 01:24:39.814
Meanwhile, real people are being
murdered every day in Vietnam.

01:25:02.504 --> 01:25:04.373
Want me to suck your cock
while driving?

01:25:13.282 --> 01:25:14.284
How old are you?

01:25:15.584 --> 01:25:16.551
What?

01:25:16.684 --> 01:25:18.353
How old are you?

01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:21.623
Wow, man.

01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:24.926
That's the first time
anybody asked that

01:25:25.059 --> 01:25:26.327
in a long time.

01:25:26.461 --> 01:25:27.930
What's the answer?

01:25:30.498 --> 01:25:33.903
Okay. We gonna play
kiddie games?

01:25:35.203 --> 01:25:37.773
Eighteen. Feel better?

01:25:37.907 --> 01:25:39.708
You got some ID,
you know,

01:25:39.841 --> 01:25:42.009
like a driver's license
or something?

01:25:42.144 --> 01:25:44.780
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not.

01:25:44.912 --> 01:25:48.383
I need to see something official
that verifies that you're 18,

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:51.287
which you don't have
because you're not.

01:25:54.556 --> 01:25:57.059
Talk about a bring-down bummer,
dude.

01:25:57.192 --> 01:25:58.261
That's you.

01:25:58.394 --> 01:25:59.596
Yeah.

01:26:04.166 --> 01:26:08.070
Obviously,
I'm not too young to fuck you.

01:26:08.203 --> 01:26:10.372
But obviously,
you are too old to fuck me.

01:26:11.907 --> 01:26:15.277
What I'm too old to do
is go to jail for poontang.

01:26:17.246 --> 01:26:19.248
Prison's been trying to get me
all my life.

01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.750
It ain't got me yet.
The day it does,

01:26:21.884 --> 01:26:24.286
it won't be because of you.

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:25.555
No offense.

01:26:28.523 --> 01:26:30.358
<i>You all right?</i>

01:26:30.492 --> 01:26:32.861
She's just
fine, ain't you, shorty?

01:26:32.995 --> 01:26:34.697
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

01:26:34.831 --> 01:26:36.297
<i>They haven't hurt you?</i>

01:26:36.431 --> 01:26:38.233
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:41.203
I'll be right out.

01:26:42.604 --> 01:26:44.806
<i>The war.</i>

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.777
<i>I rode with
the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

01:27:40.028 --> 01:27:42.665
Stand by, guys.
We're going in five.

01:27:57.545 --> 01:28:00.048
Lancer's boys are here!

01:28:00.181 --> 01:28:02.218
The old man here?

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:03.919
Nada.

01:28:04.051 --> 01:28:05.520
But the son is.

01:28:07.622 --> 01:28:09.590
Ah. Heh, heh.

01:28:09.724 --> 01:28:11.193
The one from Boston.

01:28:12.394 --> 01:28:13.328
I don't know.

01:28:14.362 --> 01:28:15.730
You from Boston?

01:28:15.864 --> 01:28:16.898
Yes.

01:28:17.032 --> 01:28:18.501
It's the Boston one!

01:28:20.303 --> 01:28:22.104
Keep the others outside.

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:24.674
Let the brother come in.

01:28:26.309 --> 01:28:28.044
You heard him, Boston.

01:28:37.019 --> 01:28:38.821
Come on in, Boston.

01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:41.556
See, honey?

01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:43.893
I told you they'd come
to parlay.

01:28:45.527 --> 01:28:46.761
You all right,
honey?

01:28:46.895 --> 01:28:49.898
Oh, she's just fine.

01:28:50.032 --> 01:28:51.701
Ain't you, shorty?

01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:54.836
I'm fine, Scott.

01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:56.739
They haven't hurt you?

01:28:56.871 --> 01:28:58.940
Not yet, I ain't.

01:28:59.073 --> 01:29:00.876
But that can all change...

01:29:02.044 --> 01:29:02.911
like that.

01:29:06.747 --> 01:29:08.216
Say...

01:29:08.349 --> 01:29:10.018
where'd you get that limp?

01:29:11.487 --> 01:29:12.788
- From the war.
- Mm.

01:29:14.089 --> 01:29:15.690
Which side?

01:29:15.825 --> 01:29:19.027
I rode with the British cavalry
in India.

01:29:19.161 --> 01:29:20.729
Mm.

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:23.364
What'd they call that outfit?

01:29:23.497 --> 01:29:24.899
Bengal Lancers.

01:29:28.836 --> 01:29:30.871
Now, now, now,
that is funny.

01:29:31.005 --> 01:29:33.441
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

01:29:33.575 --> 01:29:34.809
Don't you get it?

01:29:34.943 --> 01:29:36.812
"Bengal Lancer"?

01:29:36.944 --> 01:29:38.281
Hm?

01:29:38.413 --> 01:29:39.748
Oh, yeah.

01:29:39.881 --> 01:29:41.482
I get it now.

01:29:41.617 --> 01:29:44.686
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

01:29:44.819 --> 01:29:48.189
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

01:29:48.323 --> 01:29:50.792
So is blowing the heads
off little girls.

01:29:52.327 --> 01:29:55.330
But they can only hang me
once, right?

01:29:56.497 --> 01:29:57.433
So...

01:29:59.067 --> 01:30:00.636
you come down here for a...

01:30:00.769 --> 01:30:03.005
For a Boston social?

01:30:03.138 --> 01:30:05.774
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

01:30:05.907 --> 01:30:09.877
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:13.482
a whole lot of chicken mole
in Mexico.

01:30:13.614 --> 01:30:15.017
That's a lot of money.

01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:17.486
Well, she's a lot
of little girl.

01:30:17.618 --> 01:30:19.386
Or don't you agree?

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.822
I agree.

01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:24.459
So, what's next?

01:30:24.593 --> 01:30:26.961
Well, I'll send one of my boys
out to your ranch

01:30:27.095 --> 01:30:29.365
to fill you in
on all the details, but, uh...

01:30:31.166 --> 01:30:35.071
the one detail I'm gonna fill
you in on right now is this:

01:30:36.438 --> 01:30:39.373
I don't want
no beaner bronco buster

01:30:39.507 --> 01:30:41.109
handing me that $50,000.

01:30:41.243 --> 01:30:44.380
I want the old man himself.

01:30:44.513 --> 01:30:50.051
Murdoch Lancer
puts $50,000 in my lap...

01:30:50.184 --> 01:30:53.354
or I heave this little pitcher
down a well!

01:30:53.487 --> 01:30:55.990
You got that, Boston?

01:30:56.125 --> 01:30:57.859
Huh?

01:30:57.992 --> 01:30:59.393
Yeah.

01:30:59.528 --> 01:31:01.797
All right, messenger boy.

01:31:03.331 --> 01:31:04.866
Deliver my message.

01:31:11.639 --> 01:31:15.076
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:17.011
Settle into it.

01:31:17.144 --> 01:31:19.147
Enjoy it.

01:31:19.281 --> 01:31:20.381
And cut!

01:31:23.051 --> 01:31:24.219
Oh, boy.

01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:25.921
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella,

01:31:26.054 --> 01:31:28.390
- with that throw, did I?
- No, no, no. I'm good.

01:31:28.523 --> 01:31:30.024
I got pads on.

01:31:30.158 --> 01:31:32.161
And I throw myself on the floor

01:31:32.294 --> 01:31:35.264
just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

01:31:35.397 --> 01:31:36.665
The gate's clean.

01:31:36.797 --> 01:31:39.201
Rick, Rick, Rick.

01:31:39.334 --> 01:31:40.903
Put her there.

01:31:41.036 --> 01:31:42.136
- That was it.
- Really?

01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.705
That was absolutely fantastic.

01:31:43.839 --> 01:31:45.107
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:47.109
Your idea about
throwing the little girl

01:31:47.242 --> 01:31:49.044
on the ground
just worked like a charm.

01:31:49.178 --> 01:31:51.145
I figured you said Shakespeare,
so... Yeah.

01:31:51.279 --> 01:31:52.380
That's right. That was...

01:31:52.514 --> 01:31:54.584
That's what I mean
by "scare me."

01:31:54.716 --> 01:31:57.085
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

01:31:57.219 --> 01:31:59.621
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

01:31:59.754 --> 01:32:01.823
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

01:32:01.956 --> 01:32:03.491
Where the hell
did that come from?

01:32:03.626 --> 01:32:05.761
- I don't know. Improv.
- That was wonderful.

01:32:05.894 --> 01:32:09.298
It was just... That was
a triple alliterative improv.

01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:10.933
You don't hear those
too often.

01:32:11.065 --> 01:32:12.901
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't...?

01:32:13.035 --> 01:32:14.603
- Don't need to go again?
- We're done.

01:32:14.736 --> 01:32:16.071
- That was fantastic.
- All right.

01:32:16.203 --> 01:32:18.072
Okay, moving on.
We're in the bordello.

01:32:18.206 --> 01:32:19.608
Next setup!

01:32:23.411 --> 01:32:27.149
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

01:32:28.617 --> 01:32:29.484
Thank you.

01:32:29.617 --> 01:32:30.785
Heh.

01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:49.438
Rick fucking Dalton.

01:33:02.885 --> 01:33:03.986
That's a car.

01:33:05.287 --> 01:33:06.756
That's a strange car.

01:33:08.122 --> 01:33:10.459
Snake, go see
who's outside.

01:33:22.938 --> 01:33:24.340
So who is it?

01:33:24.473 --> 01:33:26.308
I ain't for sure yet.

01:33:26.442 --> 01:33:28.643
It's a bitchen yellow
Coupe de Ville.

01:33:28.777 --> 01:33:30.880
Keep an eye on him.

01:34:19.728 --> 01:34:21.263
Come on.

01:34:37.879 --> 01:34:39.614
Where the hell
is everybody?

01:34:48.924 --> 01:34:50.358
Hey, where's Gypsy?

01:34:50.492 --> 01:34:52.194
She's down
by the chop shop.

01:34:59.033 --> 01:35:01.135
- Hey!
- Hello!

01:35:01.269 --> 01:35:04.305
Gypsy! I want you
to come meet my new friend.

01:35:04.438 --> 01:35:06.740
Some old-looking
dude in a Hawaiian shirt

01:35:06.875 --> 01:35:08.544
who just gave Pussycat
a ride home.

01:35:08.676 --> 01:35:10.278
He just gave her a lift?

01:35:10.412 --> 01:35:12.414
Nope. She's bringing him

01:35:12.547 --> 01:35:14.416
down the ranch
to meet everybody.

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:17.118
Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.

01:35:19.287 --> 01:35:21.590
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

01:35:21.723 --> 01:35:24.158
Thank you for giving
our precious Pussy a ride home.

01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:25.493
Think nothing of it.

01:35:25.626 --> 01:35:26.995
We love Pussy.

01:35:27.129 --> 01:35:28.631
Yes, we do.

01:35:28.764 --> 01:35:30.899
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?

01:35:31.032 --> 01:35:33.567
Everybody left
for Santa Barbara.

01:35:33.702 --> 01:35:35.170
Really?

01:35:35.304 --> 01:35:37.305
Charlie's gone?
Everybody left?

01:35:37.438 --> 01:35:40.441
Well, not "everybody" everybody,
but mostly everybody.

01:35:43.411 --> 01:35:44.313
Drag.

01:35:45.714 --> 01:35:48.317
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:50.719
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig you.

01:35:50.853 --> 01:35:53.154
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

01:35:53.288 --> 01:35:55.724
Yeah, you got to come back.

01:35:55.858 --> 01:35:57.827
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

01:35:59.661 --> 01:36:02.663
So how's it all
comparing to your glory days?

01:36:02.796 --> 01:36:04.366
Well, things have changed.

01:36:07.769 --> 01:36:09.671
Not a bad mount, Connie.

01:36:09.804 --> 01:36:12.139
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

01:36:12.273 --> 01:36:14.309
- Is that right?
- Every day?

01:36:14.442 --> 01:36:16.345
Well, every week.

01:36:16.478 --> 01:36:18.046
All right.

01:36:18.179 --> 01:36:19.880
Ain't she just darling?

01:36:23.519 --> 01:36:26.688
So, uh, my name is Lulu.

01:36:26.821 --> 01:36:28.590
This is Tex.

01:36:28.724 --> 01:36:30.992
We're gonna be leading you
on a great trail ride

01:36:31.126 --> 01:36:33.495
through the beautiful
Santa Susana canyons.

01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:36.832
Now, Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

01:36:36.965 --> 01:36:39.233
- Yes.
- Yeah, so are you, Connie?

01:36:39.367 --> 01:36:41.370
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex? Come here.

01:36:41.502 --> 01:36:44.005
So, uh, if you're both
experienced riders,

01:36:44.139 --> 01:36:47.276
I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.

01:36:47.408 --> 01:36:48.675
You ready to have some fun?

01:36:48.809 --> 01:36:51.545
So Pussycat brought back
some guy with her.

01:36:51.679 --> 01:36:53.647
Gypsy wants you
to go give him a look-see.

01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:55.350
Yeah. Sure thing.

01:37:14.202 --> 01:37:17.172
Oh, and here's someone
you absolutely have to meet.

01:37:17.305 --> 01:37:19.607
One of our most favorite sons.

01:37:19.741 --> 01:37:22.377
Tex, come on over here
and say hi to Cliff.

01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:24.612
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

01:37:24.746 --> 01:37:28.250
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

01:37:28.382 --> 01:37:29.250
Copeville.

01:37:29.384 --> 01:37:31.587
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.188
Course I have.

01:37:33.321 --> 01:37:35.790
Yeah, I spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.

01:37:35.924 --> 01:37:37.559
In August, no less.

01:37:37.692 --> 01:37:40.095
That doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

01:37:40.228 --> 01:37:43.131
It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.

01:37:47.568 --> 01:37:48.469
Man...

01:37:49.772 --> 01:37:52.241
Charlie's gonna dig you.

01:37:52.373 --> 01:37:54.643
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

01:37:54.776 --> 01:37:57.178
Everybody's talking
all friendly.

01:37:57.312 --> 01:37:59.846
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:03.151
Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.

01:38:03.285 --> 01:38:05.586
If he comes this
way, let me know.

01:38:08.256 --> 01:38:10.825
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

01:38:10.959 --> 01:38:13.495
Yeah, George
still owns it.

01:38:13.627 --> 01:38:16.031
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

01:38:16.163 --> 01:38:19.032
Does he still live
right there?

01:38:19.166 --> 01:38:20.134
Yeah.

01:38:20.268 --> 01:38:21.536
Is he here now?

01:38:21.670 --> 01:38:23.272
I guess so.

01:38:25.273 --> 01:38:27.875
So George gave you all
permission to be here?

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:30.278
Course he did.

01:38:30.412 --> 01:38:31.981
And y'all take care of him?

01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:35.283
Oh, we take care
of George.

01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:36.517
We love George.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.321
Well,
is there anything wrong

01:38:40.455 --> 01:38:42.623
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

01:38:42.756 --> 01:38:44.526
You can't see him
right now.

01:38:44.658 --> 01:38:46.894
Why can't I see him
right now?

01:38:48.496 --> 01:38:50.164
Because
he's napping.

01:38:51.965 --> 01:38:53.968
This is his nap time.

01:39:03.478 --> 01:39:06.047
Well, I think I'll just
go see for myself.

01:39:07.415 --> 01:39:09.216
You never know.

01:39:09.349 --> 01:39:11.018
He might have just woke up.

01:39:20.595 --> 01:39:22.731
The old Hawaiian
guy's coming this way.

01:39:23.965 --> 01:39:25.567
Okay, y'all, beat it.

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.036
I'll handle this guy.

01:39:31.139 --> 01:39:32.140
Fine.

01:40:17.786 --> 01:40:19.288
You the mama bear?

01:40:21.089 --> 01:40:23.158
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

01:40:23.291 --> 01:40:26.259
I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

01:40:26.394 --> 01:40:27.762
That's very nice of you,

01:40:27.894 --> 01:40:29.730
but you picked
the wrong time.

01:40:29.864 --> 01:40:31.832
George is taking a nap
right now.

01:40:31.966 --> 01:40:33.835
Oh, that is unfortunate.

01:40:33.968 --> 01:40:35.237
Yes, it is.

01:40:36.604 --> 01:40:39.007
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.507
How do you know George?

01:40:40.642 --> 01:40:43.010
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

01:40:43.144 --> 01:40:45.413
When was the last time
you saw George?

01:40:45.546 --> 01:40:48.750
Oh, I'd say about...

01:40:49.651 --> 01:40:50.986
eight years ago.

01:40:52.554 --> 01:40:54.089
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:40:54.223 --> 01:40:56.357
I didn't realize the two of you
were so close.

01:40:56.491 --> 01:40:58.193
When he wakes up,

01:40:58.327 --> 01:41:00.429
I'll let him know you came by.

01:41:00.562 --> 01:41:03.064
I'd really like to say
a quick hello now

01:41:03.197 --> 01:41:04.431
while I'm here.

01:41:04.564 --> 01:41:06.067
Came a long ways.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.937
Don't know when I'll get back
this way again.

01:41:09.069 --> 01:41:12.506
Oh, I understand, but I'm
afraid that's impossible.

01:41:12.639 --> 01:41:14.274
Impossible?

01:41:14.408 --> 01:41:16.143
Why is that impossible?

01:41:16.278 --> 01:41:18.513
Me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday night...

01:41:18.647 --> 01:41:20.782
<i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i>
...but George finds it hard

01:41:20.916 --> 01:41:22.350
to keep awake,
so I make him nap

01:41:22.483 --> 01:41:24.619
so I don't get gypped out
of my TV time.

01:41:24.752 --> 01:41:25.987
Ah.

01:41:27.322 --> 01:41:31.359
Well, look, Red,
I'm coming in there.

01:41:31.492 --> 01:41:35.496
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna
get a good look at George.

01:41:36.264 --> 01:41:37.466
And this...

01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:41.103
ain't stopping me.

01:41:44.572 --> 01:41:45.473
Okay.

01:41:46.675 --> 01:41:48.210
Suit yourself.

01:43:14.261 --> 01:43:15.930
He back there?

01:43:17.265 --> 01:43:19.233
Door at the end
of the hallway.

01:43:20.535 --> 01:43:22.069
You might have to
shake him awake.

01:43:22.203 --> 01:43:23.938
I fucked his brains out
this morning.

01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:31.212
He may be tired.

01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:44.459
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

01:43:46.294 --> 01:43:47.761
George is blind,

01:43:47.894 --> 01:43:50.431
so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.

01:44:15.922 --> 01:44:17.358
George, you awake?

01:44:35.777 --> 01:44:36.712
George?

01:44:39.113 --> 01:44:40.047
George?

01:44:44.118 --> 01:44:45.019
George?

01:44:47.888 --> 01:44:50.390
- George!
- Jesus.

01:44:50.524 --> 01:44:53.027
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

01:44:53.161 --> 01:44:55.197
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:58.399
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Uh... Who are you?

01:44:58.532 --> 01:45:00.402
It's Cliff Booth.

01:45:00.535 --> 01:45:03.604
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doing.

01:45:03.737 --> 01:45:05.205
John Wilkes Booth?

01:45:05.339 --> 01:45:06.675
No, Cliff Booth.

01:45:09.010 --> 01:45:10.244
Who's that?

01:45:10.377 --> 01:45:12.913
I used to shoot
<i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

01:45:13.046 --> 01:45:15.015
I was Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:17.919
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:19.586
The Dalton Brothers?

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.322
No, Rick Dalton.

01:45:22.857 --> 01:45:24.024
Who's that?

01:45:24.158 --> 01:45:26.928
He was the star
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:28.729
And who are you?

01:45:28.862 --> 01:45:30.498
I was Rick's stunt double.

01:45:31.698 --> 01:45:33.567
Rick who?

01:45:33.701 --> 01:45:35.403
It don't matter, George.

01:45:35.536 --> 01:45:38.573
We were colleagues
from the past, and I just wanted

01:45:38.706 --> 01:45:40.541
to make sure
you're doing okay.

01:45:40.675 --> 01:45:42.944
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

01:45:43.077 --> 01:45:44.746
Can't see shit.

01:45:44.879 --> 01:45:46.614
Would you call that
"the matter"?

01:45:46.747 --> 01:45:48.448
The man can't see shit,
okay?

01:45:48.582 --> 01:45:51.018
I know. I'm sorry about that.
I was told.

01:45:51.152 --> 01:45:53.721
Squeaky
sent me to bed.

01:45:53.854 --> 01:45:56.089
Would that be
the little redhead out front?

01:45:59.094 --> 01:46:01.529
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

01:46:01.662 --> 01:46:03.097
First you wake me up,

01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:05.599
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

01:46:05.733 --> 01:46:07.769
I was fucking blind!

01:46:07.902 --> 01:46:10.938
How am I gonna know
what the hell color the head

01:46:11.072 --> 01:46:13.774
of the girl is that's with me
all the time?

01:46:13.907 --> 01:46:15.676
Oh, fair enough, George.

01:46:19.212 --> 01:46:22.483
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

01:46:22.617 --> 01:46:25.120
Everyone
don't need a stuntman.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:35.163
I don't know who you are...

01:46:36.797 --> 01:46:38.834
but you touched me today.

01:46:40.835 --> 01:46:43.337
You came to visit me.

01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:45.505
Now I got to go back to sleep.

01:46:48.076 --> 01:46:50.711
I got to watch
<i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.

01:46:50.845 --> 01:46:52.347
I watch it with Squeaky.

01:46:53.814 --> 01:46:57.285
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

01:46:57.417 --> 01:47:00.221
What happens when she
gets pissed off, George?

01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:02.623
Nothing.

01:47:04.291 --> 01:47:06.627
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

01:47:11.498 --> 01:47:15.202
So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?

01:47:20.774 --> 01:47:23.176
Just who the fuck are you?

01:47:23.309 --> 01:47:25.178
I'm Cliff Booth.

01:47:25.312 --> 01:47:26.514
I'm a stuntman.

01:47:26.647 --> 01:47:28.815
We used to work together,
George.

01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:31.652
And I just want
to make sure you're okay.

01:47:31.786 --> 01:47:35.456
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:38.326
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

01:47:38.459 --> 01:47:40.729
She loves me.

01:47:42.929 --> 01:47:45.032
So suck on that.

01:47:53.506 --> 01:47:55.175
You take care, George.

01:48:02.015 --> 01:48:03.651
Goddamn it.

01:48:25.105 --> 01:48:26.575
You embarrassed me.

01:48:27.575 --> 01:48:29.911
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.114
How'd your little talk
with George go?

01:48:34.247 --> 01:48:35.248
Are we kidnapping him?

01:48:35.381 --> 01:48:37.117
Not the word I'd use.

01:48:37.251 --> 01:48:39.454
Now you've talked to him, you
believe everything's all right?

01:48:39.586 --> 01:48:41.421
Not exactly.

01:48:41.555 --> 01:48:43.456
This was a mistake.
You should leave.

01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:45.326
Way ahead of you.

01:48:49.464 --> 01:48:51.599
George isn't blind!

01:48:51.732 --> 01:48:53.301
You're the blind one!

01:49:38.145 --> 01:49:39.813
You do that?

01:49:44.919 --> 01:49:46.955
You know, that's not my car.

01:49:47.087 --> 01:49:49.157
That's my boss's car.

01:49:49.290 --> 01:49:51.593
And if something were to happen
to my boss's car,

01:49:51.725 --> 01:49:53.161
well, I'd get in trouble.

01:50:11.479 --> 01:50:12.880
Fix it.

01:50:13.013 --> 01:50:15.183
Fuck you.

01:50:41.407 --> 01:50:43.611
- Leave him alone!
- He's a flower!

01:50:43.745 --> 01:50:45.279
He's a flower, man.

01:50:45.412 --> 01:50:47.747
He's just a flower.
He doesn't know better.

01:50:47.881 --> 01:50:49.683
Ladies.

01:50:55.723 --> 01:50:58.760
Come one step closer
and I will knock his teeth out.

01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:11.805
Fix it.

01:51:11.938 --> 01:51:14.207
Can I at least get a rag
to wipe my face first?

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.809
Nope.

01:51:15.943 --> 01:51:17.611
Tire first.

01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:29.622
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

01:51:29.756 --> 01:51:33.260
Get on a horse, go get Tex
and get his ass down here.

01:51:33.394 --> 01:51:34.295
Okay.

01:51:43.604 --> 01:51:45.306
<i>I love you.</i>

01:52:09.697 --> 01:52:12.132
Tex! Tex!

01:52:12.267 --> 01:52:13.968
That Hawaiian guy's
back at the ranch

01:52:14.102 --> 01:52:15.269
kicking Clem's face in.

01:52:15.403 --> 01:52:17.171
Ah, son of a...

01:52:17.304 --> 01:52:18.772
I'll take over for Tex.

01:52:18.906 --> 01:52:20.575
Right this way.

01:52:47.201 --> 01:52:49.037
Hyah! Hyah!

01:53:10.825 --> 01:53:12.492
Clem, you all right?

01:53:33.714 --> 01:53:35.349
How do?

01:53:35.483 --> 01:53:38.753
What a day.
Shit, I almost lost my shit.

01:54:26.867 --> 01:54:28.069
You, uh...

01:54:28.202 --> 01:54:30.271
You want to come in
and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i>

01:54:30.404 --> 01:54:33.174
Why, I just figured we would.
I got a six-pack in the back.

01:54:33.306 --> 01:54:34.575
Thought we'd order a pizza.

01:54:34.707 --> 01:54:35.942
All right.

01:54:36.076 --> 01:54:37.344
All right.

01:54:58.498 --> 01:55:01.001
<i>Eighteen miles to Pendleton,
Willard.</i>

01:55:01.135 --> 01:55:03.304
<i>Any kind of luck,
we'll be unloaded</i>

01:55:03.438 --> 01:55:05.940
<i>and back at El Toro
before my kids go to bed.</i>

01:55:10.778 --> 01:55:14.515
Hey, bought me
an acid-dipped cigarette today.

01:55:14.648 --> 01:55:15.950
Oh, yeah?

01:55:16.082 --> 01:55:18.118
You want to buy
a cigarette dipped in acid?

01:55:18.251 --> 01:55:19.786
Yeah.

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.955
If I'm gonna trip,
I want to trip here, man.

01:55:22.089 --> 01:55:24.158
Walk in the woods.
Not in my home.

01:55:26.126 --> 01:55:27.294
Just gonna stash it here.

01:55:27.428 --> 01:55:29.529
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

01:55:29.663 --> 01:55:32.498
You want to smoke some,
smoke some. Just save me some.

01:55:32.632 --> 01:55:35.868
Nah, I don't need
to trip out on no acid.

01:55:36.002 --> 01:55:37.839
My booze don't need no buddy.

01:55:37.971 --> 01:55:39.172
Whoa! Oh!

01:55:39.305 --> 01:55:41.142
Here I come. Here I come.

01:55:43.176 --> 01:55:44.377
Mm.

01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:46.546
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

01:55:46.679 --> 01:55:48.215
<i>There's a truck tailing us,
sir.</i>

01:55:51.484 --> 01:55:53.955
<i>It might be a farmer
in a hurry to get someplace.</i>

01:55:55.822 --> 01:55:57.490
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

01:55:57.625 --> 01:55:59.794
<i>Well,
take it as fast as you can.</i>

01:55:59.926 --> 01:56:00.995
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:56:04.297 --> 01:56:05.632
That PCH?

01:56:05.765 --> 01:56:08.736
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

01:56:08.868 --> 01:56:11.171
Puerco Canyon or some shit.
I don't know.

01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:19.679
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

01:56:22.849 --> 01:56:24.184
Boom! Ha, ha!

01:56:24.318 --> 01:56:26.254
Oh, man. Right in the face.

01:56:38.165 --> 01:56:39.733
That was a smooth leap.

01:56:39.867 --> 01:56:40.768
Thank you.

01:56:44.104 --> 01:56:46.941
Dead number two.

01:56:53.679 --> 01:56:55.414
I like that shot.

01:56:55.549 --> 01:56:58.051
That guy's a fucking prick.

01:57:04.358 --> 01:57:06.294
Um, that's Bobby Hogan.
Good guy.

01:57:15.769 --> 01:57:18.071
All right, get ready
for my big <i>F.B.I.</i> moment.

01:57:18.205 --> 01:57:20.440

- <i>Good.</i>

"Michael Murtaugh."

01:57:30.617 --> 01:57:32.453
- <i>The F.B.I.</i>
- Michael Murtaugh.

01:57:32.586 --> 01:57:33.853
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Sergio.

01:57:33.987 --> 01:57:35.756
Turn on Channel 7.

<i>F.B.I.</i>

01:57:39.026 --> 01:57:41.929

Except when Rick Dalton's
got a fucking shotgun,

01:58:02.817 --> 01:58:04.685
- I'll tell you that.
- You're goddamn right.

01:58:04.818 --> 01:58:05.819
<i>...new Ford Cortina.</i>

<i>After that Musso
& Frank's lunch meeting,</i>

01:58:38.484 --> 01:58:40.720
<i>Marvin did provide Rick
job opportunities</i>

01:58:40.854 --> 01:58:42.356
<i>in the Italian film industry.</i>

01:58:42.488 --> 01:58:45.858
Rick Dalton,
Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.

Hennessy X.O on the rocks.

01:58:47.894 --> 01:58:49.362
Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

01:58:49.496 --> 01:58:50.663
Two words.

01:58:50.797 --> 01:58:53.233
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

01:58:53.366 --> 01:58:55.269
N-Nebraska what?

01:58:55.402 --> 01:58:56.404
Sergio who?

01:58:56.537 --> 01:58:58.072
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

01:58:58.205 --> 01:58:59.672
A-and who's that?

01:58:59.806 --> 01:59:01.207
The second-best director

01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:03.442
of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

01:59:03.577 --> 01:59:06.881
He's doing a new Western.
It's called <i>Nebraska Jim.</i>

01:59:07.014 --> 01:59:09.450
And because of me,
he's considering you.

01:59:09.582 --> 01:59:12.451
<i>Well, Rick got</i> Nebraska Jim.

01:59:12.586 --> 01:59:14.955
<i>And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim,</i>

01:59:15.089 --> 01:59:17.457
<i>existing quite nicely
within Sergio Corbucci's</i>

01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:19.926
<i>rogues gallery of antiheroes.</i>

01:59:21.362 --> 01:59:22.930
<i>In Rome,
Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

01:59:23.063 --> 01:59:24.597
<i>and the fuss
they made over him</i>

01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:28.268
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim
<i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

01:59:28.401 --> 01:59:31.906
All right there, paparazzos.
All right. Take it easy.

01:59:32.038 --> 01:59:34.640
<i>He loved the food
so much that during his stay,</i>

01:59:34.774 --> 01:59:36.609
<i>Rick gained
almost 15 pounds.</i>

01:59:36.743 --> 01:59:39.612
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

01:59:39.746 --> 01:59:41.414
<i>In fact,
he thought the post-synced,</i>

01:59:41.547 --> 01:59:43.416
<i>"every actor
speaks their own language,"</i>

01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:45.185
<i>Tower of Babel shooting style</i>

<i>of European movies
was ridiculous.</i>

01:59:48.089 --> 01:59:50.290
<i>While in Rome,
Marvin plugged Rick</i>

01:59:50.424 --> 01:59:52.193
<i>into three other
Italian productions.</i>

01:59:52.326 --> 01:59:53.859
<i>His second Western was</i>

01:59:53.993 --> 01:59:56.096

<i>His third was

<i>although his swank

02:01:13.639 --> 02:01:15.575
<i>ate up a big chunk

<i>towards a new life
and uncertain future,</i>

02:01:36.063 --> 02:01:39.200
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

02:01:41.635 --> 02:01:43.870
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

02:01:44.004 --> 02:01:46.273
<i>working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

02:01:46.406 --> 02:01:49.910
<i>Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.</i>

02:01:50.044 --> 02:01:51.478
<i>He kept Rick company</i>

02:01:51.612 --> 02:01:54.581
<i>during his entire
six-month stay in Italy.</i>

02:01:54.715 --> 02:01:57.985
<i>However,
as the two men return home,</i>

02:01:58.117 --> 02:01:59.719
<i>they've come
to an understanding.</i>

02:01:59.854 --> 02:02:01.155
Well, here it goes now.

02:02:02.723 --> 02:02:03.690
With the, uh...

02:02:05.192 --> 02:02:06.727
With the new wife, I, uh...

02:02:08.194 --> 02:02:11.197
I just I can't afford you
anymore, Cliff.

02:02:11.331 --> 02:02:14.701
You know? I can barely afford
my own house anymore.

02:02:14.835 --> 02:02:17.504
So I think the plan
is to sell the house

02:02:17.636 --> 02:02:21.407
and buy-buy a condo in-in-in
Toluca Lake, bank the money.

02:02:21.541 --> 02:02:24.177
You know, live off it.
That type of thing.

02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:27.179
Hopefully,
I score come next pilot season.

02:02:27.313 --> 02:02:28.448
That's a good plan.

02:02:28.581 --> 02:02:30.616
Yeah. You know,

02:02:30.751 --> 02:02:33.120
by then, I'll know
if I have a career or not,

02:02:33.254 --> 02:02:37.256
if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

02:02:37.389 --> 02:02:41.627
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

02:02:41.761 --> 02:02:45.032
So when this whole
European journey is over,

02:02:45.165 --> 02:02:46.233
I think we've, uh...

02:02:47.902 --> 02:02:50.304
We've reached
the end of the trail, Cliff.

02:03:01.447 --> 02:03:03.450
<i>So these last
four Italian flicks,</i>

02:03:03.584 --> 02:03:05.019
<i>after nine years together,</i>

02:03:05.152 --> 02:03:08.255
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.</i>

02:03:08.389 --> 02:03:11.091
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue
what he's gonna do.</i>

02:03:11.224 --> 02:03:13.327
<i>The only thing the two men
know of for sure:</i>

02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:15.162
<i>Tonight,
Rick and Cliff will have</i>

02:03:15.295 --> 02:03:17.130
<i>a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

02:03:17.264 --> 02:03:20.300
<i>Both men know, once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

02:03:20.433 --> 02:03:22.702
<i>it'll be the end of an era
for both of them.</i>

02:03:22.836 --> 02:03:25.338
<i>And when you come to the end
of the line with a buddy</i>

02:03:25.471 --> 02:03:28.175
<i>who is more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,</i>

02:03:28.308 --> 02:03:29.710
<i>getting blind drunk together</i>

02:03:29.843 --> 02:03:32.446
<i>is really the only way
to say farewell.</i>

02:04:29.001 --> 02:04:31.537
Here it is, honey.

02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:33.339
- You like it?
- I love it.

02:04:44.884 --> 02:04:46.086
Where do you want it?

02:04:50.657 --> 02:04:51.858
<i>Hello?</i>

02:04:51.992 --> 02:04:53.394
Hey, it's Joanna and the baby.

02:04:53.527 --> 02:04:55.229
<i>Hi! Come on up.</i>

02:05:01.033 --> 02:05:02.602
Hi!

02:05:02.736 --> 02:05:05.471
Oh, honey. How are you?

02:05:05.604 --> 02:05:07.806
- Oh, my gosh, you're about to pop!
- I know!

02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:09.542
- I know.
- Oh!

02:05:09.675 --> 02:05:12.545
- And this is the nursery.
- Oh, my God, Sharon.

02:05:12.679 --> 02:05:13.947
- It's perfect.
- Do you love it?

02:05:14.081 --> 02:05:15.281
Little shoes!

02:05:15.415 --> 02:05:16.617
I know.

02:05:18.417 --> 02:05:20.053
I'm about to burst.

02:05:20.187 --> 02:05:22.656
- I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.
- Thank you.

02:05:25.858 --> 02:05:26.727
Mm!

02:05:39.273 --> 02:05:40.974
- Thanks, Gillian.
- Bye!

02:05:41.108 --> 02:05:42.443
Bye, Brandy!

02:05:46.913 --> 02:05:48.348
<i>Sharon had two friends</i>

02:05:48.482 --> 02:05:50.183
<i>move into
the Cielo Drive residence</i>

02:05:50.317 --> 02:05:52.785
<i>while Roman was in London
preparing his next movie:</i>

02:05:52.919 --> 02:05:56.290
<i>Voytek Frykowski, an old friend
of Roman's from Poland,</i>

02:05:56.422 --> 02:05:59.058
<i>and his girlfriend,
social worker Abigail Folger,</i>

02:05:59.192 --> 02:06:02.096
<i>heiress to the vast
Folger coffee empire.</i>

02:06:43.604 --> 02:06:45.839
<i>That night,
Sharon, her two houseguests</i>

02:06:45.971 --> 02:06:47.306
<i>and, naturally, Jay...</i>

02:06:47.439 --> 02:06:48.841
<i>all went to the West Hollywood</i>

02:06:48.974 --> 02:06:50.709
<i>Mexican restaurant landmark
El Coyote,</i>

02:06:50.844 --> 02:06:52.045
<i>on Beverly, for dinner.</i>

02:06:56.849 --> 02:06:59.218
What's going on
at the dirty movie place?

02:06:59.352 --> 02:07:01.054
Oh, they're having
a premiere.

02:07:01.187 --> 02:07:02.822
Dirty movies have premieres?

02:07:02.955 --> 02:07:05.224
Yeah. They're fun.

02:07:05.358 --> 02:07:07.060
- This place is always so busy.
- I know.

02:07:07.193 --> 02:07:08.495
It's crazy in here.

02:07:14.067 --> 02:07:15.602
And right here for you.

02:07:17.002 --> 02:07:18.938
- Gentlemen.
- Oh. Thanks.

02:07:21.041 --> 02:07:23.376
<i>While closer to
8:30, Rick and Cliff went</i>

02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:25.378
<i>to the Valley
Mexican restaurant landmark</i>

02:07:25.511 --> 02:07:26.913
<i>Casa Vega on Ventura.</i>

02:07:32.551 --> 02:07:33.786
Hello. Welcome.

02:07:35.755 --> 02:07:36.890
You're welcome, sir.

02:07:47.867 --> 02:07:50.370
Well, well, well,
if it ain't the cobra himself.

02:07:50.502 --> 02:07:52.772
- Hey, Doug. What's happening?
- How you doing?

02:07:52.906 --> 02:07:54.640
- It's good to see you.
- How's the wife?

02:07:54.773 --> 02:07:57.410
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

02:08:00.412 --> 02:08:02.549
<i>Brandy stayed
behind at Rick's house,</i>

02:08:02.683 --> 02:08:05.251
<i>guarding the beautiful
Italian woman asleep in her bed</i>

02:08:05.385 --> 02:08:08.088
<i>and waiting for Cliff

<i>while jet-lagged
Francesca slept.</i>

But you just get paid

02:08:16.996 --> 02:08:18.565
- that you cut his hair?
- No, no, no.

02:08:18.698 --> 02:08:20.433
I get paid $1000 a day.

02:08:20.567 --> 02:08:22.569
I get paid $1000
the day I arrive.

02:08:22.702 --> 02:08:24.705
- I get paid $1000...
- <i>At El Coyote,</i>

02:08:24.837 --> 02:08:28.474
<i>margaritas and good times
were had by all, except Sharon.</i>

02:08:28.608 --> 02:08:30.207
<i>Sharon was experiencing</i>

02:08:30.209 --> 02:08:32.278
<i>a touch of
pregnancy-induced melancholy.</i>

02:08:32.412 --> 02:08:34.147
<i>Not only that,
it was later reported</i>

02:08:34.281 --> 02:08:36.248
<i>that it was the hottest night
of the year,</i>

02:08:36.381 --> 02:08:38.218
<i>and it made her feel
especially pregnant</i>

02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:39.919
<i>in all the worst ways.</i>

02:08:40.053 --> 02:08:42.154
I don't want to party anymore.
I am tired.

02:08:42.287 --> 02:08:44.089
Because he got it done.

02:08:44.223 --> 02:08:46.759
No, it's not... It's not
because he just got it done.

02:08:46.893 --> 02:08:48.127
He had just as much time

02:08:48.261 --> 02:08:50.163
as all the rest
of the goddamn directors.

02:08:50.296 --> 02:08:52.398
What he did with that time...
That's what counted.

02:08:52.532 --> 02:08:55.235
<i>At Casa Vega,
Rick and Cliff drank so much that,</i>

02:08:55.367 --> 02:08:57.603
<i>when they left,
they left the Cadillac there</i>

02:08:57.737 --> 02:08:58.637
<i>and took a cab home.</i>

02:08:58.772 --> 02:09:00.506
The greatest action director,

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.009
underrated guy of all time.

02:09:03.143 --> 02:09:06.011
<i>Around 10,
Sharon and her friends</i>

02:09:06.145 --> 02:09:08.782
<i>left El Coyote

02:09:22.862 --> 02:09:24.831

<i>At more or less the same time,</i>

Feel better?

02:10:45.377 --> 02:10:47.714
That is drastically better.

02:10:49.381 --> 02:10:51.451
<i>It was after 11:45 by the time</i>

02:10:51.584 --> 02:10:53.752
<i>the yellow cab

All right. <i>Grazie,</i> amigo.

- How much do I owe you?
- Three dollars.

<i>Brandy was

- Thank you, brother.
- Thanks.

02:11:07.733 --> 02:11:09.068
More margaritas.

02:11:14.439 --> 02:11:15.975
<i>Around midnight,</i>

02:11:16.108 --> 02:11:18.310
<i>a completely drunk
Rick Dalton started making</i>

- We're walking.
- <i>At the same time,</i>

02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:29.755
<i>Cliff was attaching a leash</i>

<i>to an excited

I know.

02:11:38.264 --> 02:11:40.266
I remember you.

02:11:40.399 --> 02:11:41.768
A cigarette dipped in acid.

02:11:41.902 --> 02:11:44.103
- What's that do?
- You smoke it. It gets you high.

02:11:44.237 --> 02:11:46.206
- How much?
- Fifty cents.

02:11:48.273 --> 02:11:49.308
Fifty cents.

02:11:49.442 --> 02:11:51.845
Hippie girl, 50 cents.

02:11:55.281 --> 02:11:56.550

02:11:58.117 --> 02:11:59.719
Why not?

02:12:22.808 --> 02:12:25.178
And away we go.

02:12:27.346 --> 02:12:31.617
Our Polish friend said it was
the hottest day of the year.

02:12:31.751 --> 02:12:33.620
Despite the
fact that he said it,

02:12:33.752 --> 02:12:35.956
actually, it might be true.

02:13:56.702 --> 02:13:57.670
Goddamn.

02:13:58.871 --> 02:14:00.806
Fucking private road.

02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:03.442
Damn property taxes
up the butt.

02:14:03.576 --> 02:14:04.778
Goddamn.

02:14:12.218 --> 02:14:15.755
Bunch of goddamn
fucking hippies.

02:14:15.889 --> 02:14:18.225
What the fuck?

02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:22.461
Hey, you!

02:14:24.029 --> 02:14:27.968
Yeah, asshole,
I'm talking to you!

02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.902
What the hell
do you think you're doing

02:14:30.035 --> 02:14:33.439
bringing that noisy hunk of shit
around here at midnight?

02:14:33.572 --> 02:14:36.242
This is a private road,
all right?

02:14:36.376 --> 02:14:38.911
Who are you?
And who are you here to see?

02:14:39.045 --> 02:14:41.747
Nobody, sir. We just got lost
and a little turned around.

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:43.349
Ah, horseshit.

02:14:45.719 --> 02:14:47.486
You fucking hippies
came up here

02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:49.522
to smoke dope
on a dark road, huh?

02:14:49.656 --> 02:14:52.358
Next time you want to try that,
fix your fucking muffler.

02:14:52.492 --> 02:14:54.461
Look, we're really sorry
we disturbed you.

02:14:54.594 --> 02:14:56.529
Look, chief,
you don't belong here.

02:14:56.662 --> 02:14:58.663
Now, take this
mechanical asshole

02:14:58.797 --> 02:15:02.135
and get it
off my fucking street!

02:15:14.013 --> 02:15:15.480
Hey!

02:15:15.613 --> 02:15:18.317
Dennis Hopper!
Move this fucking piece of shit!

02:15:18.451 --> 02:15:20.819
All right. Just give me a moment
to turn it around.

02:15:20.953 --> 02:15:22.688
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

02:15:22.822 --> 02:15:24.723
but fucking drive it,
and drive it now!

02:15:24.857 --> 02:15:26.426
Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

02:15:26.559 --> 02:15:28.094
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

02:15:31.997 --> 02:15:35.667
The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?

02:15:35.801 --> 02:15:39.672
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

02:15:45.377 --> 02:15:46.845
Dirty fucking hippies.

02:15:59.826 --> 02:16:01.527
There in his
fancy fucking house,

02:16:01.661 --> 02:16:03.296
thinking he's handled it.

02:16:03.429 --> 02:16:06.032
But he's seen us.
He's awake. He's alert.

02:16:06.165 --> 02:16:09.402
They're all awake. They're
listening to fucking records.

02:16:09.535 --> 02:16:10.937
Everybody's fucking awake!

02:16:11.069 --> 02:16:12.205
Look!

02:16:12.337 --> 02:16:14.806
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:18.978
"Go to Terry's old house
and kill everybody in there."

02:16:19.112 --> 02:16:22.781
And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."

02:16:22.915 --> 02:16:25.917
Now, he either said that,

02:16:26.051 --> 02:16:27.786
or I'm a liar.

02:16:29.255 --> 02:16:32.358
Now, are any one of you
calling me a liar?

02:16:33.425 --> 02:16:34.959
Hm?

02:16:35.093 --> 02:16:36.928
How about you?

02:16:37.062 --> 02:16:38.564
Are you calling me a liar?

02:16:40.032 --> 02:16:42.067
No, of course not.

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.067
Good.

02:16:43.201 --> 02:16:44.570
Hold it.

02:16:44.702 --> 02:16:47.138
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

02:16:47.272 --> 02:16:48.473
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

02:16:48.606 --> 02:16:50.308
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

02:16:50.442 --> 02:16:53.379
That guy in the robe
was Jake Cahill.

02:16:53.513 --> 02:16:55.748
Wait a minute.
That was fucking Jake Cahill

02:16:55.882 --> 02:16:57.316
that just yelled at me?

02:16:57.450 --> 02:16:59.218
He was older,
but, yeah, I think so.

02:16:59.352 --> 02:17:00.452
So who's this Rick guy?

02:17:00.587 --> 02:17:02.388
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together.

02:17:02.522 --> 02:17:04.722
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill
on a cowboy show

02:17:04.856 --> 02:17:06.224
in the '50s called
<i>Bounty Law.</i>

02:17:06.357 --> 02:17:07.659
Fuck you, Katie.

02:17:07.793 --> 02:17:09.161
Sorry I don't know
the name

02:17:09.294 --> 02:17:11.062
of every fascist on TV
in the '50s.

02:17:11.196 --> 02:17:15.633
I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.

02:17:15.767 --> 02:17:18.504
When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

02:17:18.636 --> 02:17:20.906
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

02:17:22.275 --> 02:17:24.977
Dig this!

02:17:25.111 --> 02:17:26.978
When we've been having
our trip sessions,

02:17:27.111 --> 02:17:29.648
I've been expanding
on this one idea in my head.

02:17:29.781 --> 02:17:31.282
All right, dig it.

02:17:31.416 --> 02:17:34.886
We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

02:17:35.019 --> 02:17:36.554
And if you grew up watching TV,

02:17:36.688 --> 02:17:38.558
that means you grew up
watching murder.

02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:39.558
Mm-hm.

02:17:39.691 --> 02:17:41.326
Every show on TV

02:17:41.459 --> 02:17:44.196
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i>
was about murder.

02:17:44.329 --> 02:17:47.366
So my idea is...

02:17:47.499 --> 02:17:49.868
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

02:17:51.937 --> 02:17:53.504
I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

02:17:53.639 --> 02:17:56.041
We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

02:17:56.175 --> 02:17:57.977
The people
an entire generation grew up

02:17:58.109 --> 02:17:59.745
watching kill people
live here.

02:17:59.879 --> 02:18:01.847
And they live
in pig-shit fucking luxury.

02:18:01.981 --> 02:18:03.482
I say fuck them.

02:18:03.615 --> 02:18:06.050
I say we cut their cocks off
and make them eat it.

02:18:06.186 --> 02:18:08.355
That's a great idea, Sadie.

02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:12.525
You two ready
to kill some piggies?

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.201
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

02:18:24.337 --> 02:18:26.705
Sorry, I forgot my knife
in the car.

02:18:26.838 --> 02:18:28.639
Can I go...?
Can I go back and get it?

02:18:29.775 --> 02:18:31.044
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

02:18:31.177 --> 02:18:33.145
- Go on. Wait a minute.
- What?

02:18:33.278 --> 02:18:35.380
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:39.584
Oh.

02:18:39.718 --> 02:18:41.553
Right. Thank you.

02:18:41.687 --> 02:18:44.322
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

02:18:44.456 --> 02:18:47.425
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

02:18:57.736 --> 02:18:59.371
Oh, that fucking bitch!

02:18:59.504 --> 02:19:00.606
Shh! Calm down.

02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:02.409
There's a fucking house
right there.

02:19:03.709 --> 02:19:04.709
What do we do now?

02:19:04.843 --> 02:19:06.278
We do what we came to do.

02:19:06.411 --> 02:19:09.180
And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.

02:19:09.314 --> 02:19:10.514
Any more questions?

02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:11.885
Hm?

02:19:13.818 --> 02:19:16.589
Okay, pig killers,
let's kill some piggies.

02:19:16.722 --> 02:19:17.924
All right.

02:19:30.635 --> 02:19:32.438
Oh, someone's hungry.

02:19:41.213 --> 02:19:42.315
All right.

02:19:44.249 --> 02:19:46.119
It's feeding time.

02:19:49.122 --> 02:19:50.290
Brandy, couch.

02:19:56.928 --> 02:19:58.297
And don't you mo...

02:20:06.772 --> 02:20:08.707
Oh, man.

02:20:11.443 --> 02:20:12.345
Uh...

02:20:17.817 --> 02:20:19.853
The train
has left the station.

02:20:26.792 --> 02:20:28.027
Bad idea.

02:21:28.653 --> 02:21:30.156
Whoa.

02:22:17.535 --> 02:22:20.671
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

02:22:20.805 --> 02:22:22.641
All right? Go.

02:23:09.654 --> 02:23:10.956
Hey.

02:23:13.992 --> 02:23:18.029
I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

02:23:18.163 --> 02:23:20.332
Now, I do not want
to get into it tonight.

02:23:29.775 --> 02:23:32.511
Uh... can I help you?

02:23:38.884 --> 02:23:39.918
Shit.

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:43.154
How many other people
are here?

02:23:43.288 --> 02:23:46.058
Oh, just the one sleeping
in the back there.

02:23:47.659 --> 02:23:50.395
Go get him and bring him
into the living room.

02:23:50.528 --> 02:23:51.663
What if he says no?

02:23:51.797 --> 02:23:53.265
Don't take no for an answer.

02:23:53.398 --> 02:23:55.935
You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!

02:23:58.237 --> 02:23:59.739
Hey.

02:24:05.143 --> 02:24:06.945
You are real, right?

02:24:07.079 --> 02:24:09.716
I'm as real as a doughnut,
motherfucker.

02:24:19.591 --> 02:24:21.025
What the fuck?

02:24:27.933 --> 02:24:29.233
Go to the living room.

02:24:29.367 --> 02:24:31.036
What is going on, huh?

02:24:36.107 --> 02:24:37.809
- Go!
- Okay. <i>Si, si.</i>

02:24:40.178 --> 02:24:41.546
Who the fuck's that?

02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:42.581
I don't know.

02:24:43.981 --> 02:24:44.916
Francesca.

02:24:51.723 --> 02:24:54.392
Oh. Uh...

02:24:54.526 --> 02:24:56.261
What...?

02:24:56.394 --> 02:24:58.095
Oh, I know you.

02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:59.966
I know all three of you.

02:25:01.266 --> 02:25:03.802
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

02:25:03.936 --> 02:25:06.606
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:12.077
I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.

02:25:12.211 --> 02:25:15.714
And you, I remember
your white little face.

02:25:15.847 --> 02:25:17.749
And you were on a horsie.

02:25:17.883 --> 02:25:19.618
Yeah.

02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:22.820
Uh... You are...?

02:25:22.954 --> 02:25:24.789
I'm the devil,

02:25:24.922 --> 02:25:28.260
and I'm here to do
the devil's business.

02:25:30.963 --> 02:25:34.600
Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.

02:25:34.732 --> 02:25:36.736
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

02:25:40.239 --> 02:25:41.340
Fuck!

02:25:56.454 --> 02:25:57.856
Son of a bitch!

02:26:36.328 --> 02:26:37.230
Hey, you.

02:26:40.297 --> 02:26:42.435
How dare you come into my house,
motherfucker!

02:27:08.526 --> 02:27:10.194
Wow, man.

02:28:03.382 --> 02:28:04.483
What the fuck?

02:28:05.983 --> 02:28:07.519
Jesus Christ.

02:29:24.295 --> 02:29:25.697
Holy shit.

02:29:28.767 --> 02:29:31.569
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

02:29:50.821 --> 02:29:52.790
<i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>

02:29:52.924 --> 02:29:56.127
Around what time was it
when you confronted the intruder?

02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:58.095
It was about midnight.

02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:59.364
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

02:29:59.498 --> 02:30:01.065
How do you know
it was midnight?

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:04.436
Well, I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen.

02:30:04.569 --> 02:30:07.773
You know, I was
making margaritas, and, uh...

02:30:07.907 --> 02:30:09.607
I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler.

02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:11.409
I looked up at the clock.

02:30:11.543 --> 02:30:13.545
It said... The kitchen clock
said midnight.

02:30:13.677 --> 02:30:15.212
Twelve o'clock exactly?

02:30:15.347 --> 02:30:17.449
I mean,
it could have been 12:05.

02:30:17.581 --> 02:30:19.917
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

02:30:20.052 --> 02:30:22.153
until the woman attacked you
in the pool.

02:30:22.286 --> 02:30:24.222
No, no.

02:30:24.356 --> 02:30:26.425
So,
what did these perpetrators do?

02:30:26.559 --> 02:30:29.094
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

02:30:29.227 --> 02:30:32.665
Two of them burst through
the front door there,

02:30:32.797 --> 02:30:37.102
and the guy hippie
said he was the devil.

02:30:37.236 --> 02:30:39.938
And he said, "I'm here to...

02:30:40.071 --> 02:30:42.174
do some devil shit."

02:30:42.306 --> 02:30:44.909
Or...
That's not verbatim, but...

02:30:45.043 --> 02:30:47.813
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:03.996
And away we go.

02:31:07.198 --> 02:31:09.300
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

02:31:09.434 --> 02:31:11.069
What hospital you going to,
Cliff?

02:31:11.203 --> 02:31:12.437
I'll meet you there, huh?

02:31:12.570 --> 02:31:14.939
You don't want to meet me
in no hospital.

02:31:15.072 --> 02:31:16.908
Why don't you go take care
of your lady.

02:31:17.042 --> 02:31:19.911
Hey, she just took
five fucking sleeping pills.

02:31:20.044 --> 02:31:21.813
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

02:31:21.946 --> 02:31:24.415
These guys will probably
have to come out here again

02:31:24.549 --> 02:31:26.785
- just to wake her ass up.
- Hey, I'm not gonna die.

02:31:26.918 --> 02:31:28.754
I may get a limp,
but I ain't gonna die.

02:31:28.888 --> 02:31:30.822
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

02:31:30.955 --> 02:31:33.291
So no use waiting
in some waiting room.

02:31:33.425 --> 02:31:36.493
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature.

02:31:36.627 --> 02:31:38.129
Come visit me tomorrow.

02:31:38.263 --> 02:31:40.499
Bring bagels.

02:31:40.632 --> 02:31:43.001
You want to do something for me,
check on Brandy.

02:31:43.134 --> 02:31:44.969
She may be a little shook up
after that.

02:31:45.103 --> 02:31:47.473
- She may want to sleep with you.
- Are you kidding me?

02:31:47.606 --> 02:31:49.440
She's sleeping
with Francesca right now.

02:31:49.575 --> 02:31:51.475
You might never get her back.
Ha, ha.

02:31:51.609 --> 02:31:53.310
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

02:31:53.445 --> 02:31:55.814
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

02:31:59.284 --> 02:32:00.752
Hey. Hey.

02:32:04.722 --> 02:32:06.491
You're a good friend, Cliff.

02:32:07.992 --> 02:32:09.160
I try.

02:32:41.559 --> 02:32:42.461
Hello?

02:32:44.428 --> 02:32:45.296
Hey.

02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:46.463
I'm Jay Sebring.

02:32:46.597 --> 02:32:48.632
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

02:32:48.766 --> 02:32:51.303
You're Rick Dalton,
right?

02:32:51.436 --> 02:32:54.973
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

02:32:55.106 --> 02:32:56.907
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

02:32:57.042 --> 02:32:59.678
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

02:32:59.811 --> 02:33:01.779
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman,

02:33:01.912 --> 02:33:03.547
she just has to go next door,
right?

02:33:05.383 --> 02:33:07.084
No shit.

02:33:07.219 --> 02:33:09.553
What the fuck happened?

02:33:09.687 --> 02:33:12.222
Oh, th-these fucking
hippie weirdos,

02:33:12.356 --> 02:33:14.593
they-they-they
broke into my house.

02:33:14.725 --> 02:33:17.362
What do you mean, like,
trying to rob you?

02:33:17.495 --> 02:33:19.297
We don't know what the fuck
they wanted.

02:33:19.430 --> 02:33:21.131
Were they robbing me?
I don't know.

02:33:21.266 --> 02:33:23.368
Were they freaking out
on some bummer trip?

02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:26.772
Who knows? But they tried
to kill my wife and my buddy.

02:33:26.904 --> 02:33:30.275
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

02:33:30.409 --> 02:33:34.079
Now, my buddy and his dog
killed two of them, and then...

02:33:34.213 --> 02:33:37.215
Well, shit.
I-I torched the last one.

02:33:37.348 --> 02:33:39.084
- "Torched"?
- Yeah.

02:33:39.216 --> 02:33:41.620
I burnt her ass to a crisp.

02:33:41.752 --> 02:33:44.623
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...

02:33:44.757 --> 02:33:46.957
I got a flamethrower
in my toolshed.

02:33:47.091 --> 02:33:49.595
Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

02:33:49.728 --> 02:33:51.463
Yeah!

02:33:51.597 --> 02:33:53.064
Yeah. Yeah.

02:33:53.197 --> 02:33:54.732
That's... That's the one.

02:33:54.865 --> 02:33:58.068
Yeah, it still works too.
Thank God.

02:33:58.202 --> 02:33:59.504
Is everybody okay?

02:33:59.638 --> 02:34:02.106
Well, the fucking hippies
aren't,

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:03.976
that's for goddamn sure.

02:34:04.108 --> 02:34:05.642
Yeah. But I'm fine.

02:34:05.776 --> 02:34:07.477
You know, my wife's fine.

02:34:07.612 --> 02:34:10.314
We're just a little shook up,
is all.

02:34:10.448 --> 02:34:13.884
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
- Yeah.

02:34:14.018 --> 02:34:16.720
<i>Jay,
honey, is everything all right?</i>

02:34:16.855 --> 02:34:18.823
Everything's okay now, honey.

02:34:18.956 --> 02:34:21.693
But some hippies
broke into the house next door.

02:34:21.826 --> 02:34:23.629
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

02:34:23.761 --> 02:34:25.631
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

02:34:25.764 --> 02:34:27.331
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

02:34:27.465 --> 02:34:31.336
I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.

02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:32.871
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

02:34:34.639 --> 02:34:37.008
Yeah, that's me. Heh.

02:34:37.141 --> 02:34:39.510
<i>Oh. Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

02:34:40.612 --> 02:34:42.347
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:45.417
Yes, Sharon,
everybody's fine.

02:34:45.551 --> 02:34:47.686
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:34:49.221 --> 02:34:51.756
Well, yes, I am.
Thank you for asking that.

02:34:51.890 --> 02:34:54.259
<i>Rick,
would you like to come up to the house</i>

02:34:54.391 --> 02:34:56.861
<i>for a drink
and meet my other friends?</i>

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.169
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

02:35:06.303 --> 02:35:08.906
<i>Oh, hooray! Great.
I'll buzz you up.</i>

02:35:20.618 --> 02:35:21.519
Come on.

02:35:25.290 --> 02:35:27.425
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

02:35:27.558 --> 02:35:28.993
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

02:35:29.126 --> 02:35:30.161
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay.

02:35:30.294 --> 02:35:31.428
Pleasure's all mine.

02:35:31.562 --> 02:35:33.363
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

02:38:52.364 --> 02:38:54.099
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

02:38:54.231 --> 02:38:56.733
better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

02:38:56.867 --> 02:39:00.270
speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

02:39:00.403 --> 02:39:03.507
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

02:39:03.641 --> 02:39:05.976
But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

02:39:06.111 --> 02:39:08.579
been around since 1862,

02:39:08.713 --> 02:39:11.917
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.</i>

02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:15.152
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

02:39:15.285 --> 02:39:17.120
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

02:39:17.255 --> 02:39:20.158
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

02:39:20.291 --> 02:39:23.894
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

02:39:24.028 --> 02:39:25.929
with less burn on your throat

02:39:26.063 --> 02:39:28.499
than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

02:39:34.873 --> 02:39:36.174
Mm!

02:39:37.942 --> 02:39:40.478
Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

02:39:40.612 --> 02:39:41.479
Hm.

02:39:41.613 --> 02:39:44.448
Better drag, more flavor,

02:39:44.581 --> 02:39:45.983
less throat burn.

02:39:48.385 --> 02:39:50.988
That's the Red Apple way.

02:39:51.123 --> 02:39:54.793
So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

02:39:54.926 --> 02:39:58.496
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

02:39:58.630 --> 02:40:01.832
Take a bite
and feel all right.

02:40:01.965 --> 02:40:05.268
Take a bite of
a Red Apple.

02:40:05.402 --> 02:40:06.804
Tell them Jake sent you.

02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:11.141
And cut.

02:40:11.275 --> 02:40:13.077
This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

02:40:13.211 --> 02:40:14.979
And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

02:40:15.113 --> 02:40:16.546
I have a double chin.
All right?

02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:17.982
Nobody notices that crap?

02:40:23.843 --> 02:40:28.843
