10:38.630 --> 10:40.939
BILL:
You're tellin' me.
Luna's a beast.

10:40.980 --> 10:42.106
He'll pull through.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.639
-PAULA: Bill.
-Yeah.

10:44.990 --> 10:46.810
A bullet severed
his spinal cord.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.118
He's not gonna walk again.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.866
Well, just... just be careful.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.208
Yup. Always am.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.342
-Love you.
-I love you.

11:14.490 --> 11:15.661
[camera shutter clicks]

11:21.500 --> 11:23.149
Give me some good news.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.417
ICU.

11:24.460 --> 11:25.973
That's the best I got.

11:31.470 --> 11:32.505
Hey, guys.

11:33.510 --> 11:34.909
You get any footage off that?

11:36.520 --> 11:37.771
TECH: No, we didn't.
All the cameras
in here are fake.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.517
CADE: Nothing was stolen.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.606
No robbery.

JOSEPH [on voicemail]:
Hey, boss. It's me.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.104
Just calling to see
what kinda beer you like.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.286
Gimme a buzz.

12:08.330 --> 12:09.638
Luna said you like
lite beer.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.329
I told him
you'd rather drink water.

12:11.380 --> 12:12.984
LUNA [on voicemail]:
Sorry, Bill!
I told him not to call!

12:13.030 --> 12:15.339
Harris, will you just grab
the chicharrones. Come on.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.722
[gunshots]

12:16.770 --> 12:18.681

Luna, Luna! Luna!

Call 9-1-1!

12:22.520 --> 12:24.988
[doorbell tinkling]

12:29.830 --> 12:30.819
He didn't run.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.563
-What's that?
-The shooter.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.008
He waited
for a few seconds,

12:35.050 --> 12:36.699
and then he just slowly
pushed through the door.

12:36.750 --> 12:37.648
I heard it.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.881
He just calmly walked
out of here.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.192
In no hurry.

12:47.110 --> 12:48.452
He wasn't tryin'
to get away.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.769
So he could live
close by.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.458
One way to find out.
Let's go wake up some asses.

Units, continue
to be on the lookout

13:02.730 --> 13:03.947
for any suspicious behavior.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.331
Luna's shooter is still
on the loose.

13:05.390 --> 13:06.687
Let's make sure
we change that.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.219
Stay safe out there.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.909
Good morning, ma'am.
I'm Deputy Ward.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.428
No one knocked on my door
when y'all shot my cousin.

CADE:
Look, if you can remember
anything, here's my card.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.579
I didn't see anything.

13:20.580 --> 13:21.615
Can you help us out?

13:22.450 --> 13:24.054
What goes around,
comes around.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.419
Sheriff!

13:34.370 --> 13:36.065
-Hello, ma'am, my name's Cade--
-Hello. Shh!

13:36.110 --> 13:37.372
My son's napping.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.115
[softly]:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.594
I was just wondering
if you saw or heard anything

13:41.640 --> 13:42.948
last night, you know,

13:42.990 --> 13:44.719
an unfamiliar face
in the neighborhood

13:44.780 --> 13:46.429
or any commotion
from the neighbors.

13:46.470 --> 13:48.518
Well, my neighbors, uh,

13:48.560 --> 13:50.994
they stay out
pretty late sometimes.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.598
But you didn't
hear that from me.

13:52.650 --> 13:54.436
Well... if you see anyone

13:54.480 --> 13:56.607
that makes you think twice,
call me first.

13:56.660 --> 13:57.820
-Yes, sir.
-CADE: Yeah.

14:08.410 --> 14:10.537
Hey. Hey, wake up.

14:10.580 --> 14:11.717
[Minnick moans]

14:11.760 --> 14:13.625
I remembered something
about my day

14:13.670 --> 14:14.887
with Deputy Luna.

14:14.940 --> 14:16.840
He always had
a personalized lesson plan

14:16.890 --> 14:18.198
for his boots' first patrol.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.851
Yeah, I know.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.893
Man with a plan.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.248
So, he's, he's drilling me,

14:24.290 --> 14:25.848
and we stop off
at this strip mall,

14:25.900 --> 14:28.164
and they were selling dope
out of the laundromat.

14:28.210 --> 14:30.258
_There was this
white gangster there

14:30.300 --> 14:33.258
who knew Deputy Luna,
and he made a gun sign at us.

14:34.130 --> 14:35.165
Are you sure?

14:35.610 --> 14:37.168
Luna said he'd teach me
that lesson later.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.437
And he laughed it off,

14:38.480 --> 14:39.822
so I thought the dude
was just a punk.

14:39.870 --> 14:41.303
You got a name?

14:42.050 --> 14:43.824
I don't really remember,
but I got a place.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.393
Well, let's roll.

14:48.230 --> 14:50.141
What? Come on, man.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.703
Sheriff benched me.
I can't.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.008
Harris! You know what?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.368
Okay. Stay here.

14:55.410 --> 14:57.492
Be a good boy.
Do as you're told.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.588
But give me
the damn address.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.675
Alright, come on.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.682
[cell phone buzzing]

15:12.430 --> 15:13.556
Sheriff Hollister's phone.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.682
Hey, it's Cade.
Let me talk to Bill.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.082
I'll get the Sheriff,
hang on.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.295
Cade.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.338
Anything?

15:21.390 --> 15:22.527
We hit every door.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.390
Some friendly,
some not so much.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.522
No one knows squat.
It's too quiet here.

15:26.570 --> 15:29.095
So, I was thinking,

15:29.140 --> 15:31.358
maybe this is payback
for taking down Villalobos.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.129
Then why not
just come after us?

15:33.190 --> 15:35.750
They just did.
Your godson was right there.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.189
A warning shot
to back the hell off.

-[computer beeps]
-DEPUTY: Sheriff.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.139
Ballistics just sent this over.
We got a match.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.327
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, don't hang up.
-BILL: Hold on.

15:44.940 --> 15:47.329
DEPUTY:
The slug they pulled out
of Deputy Luna was key.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.941
The lands and grooves
resemble a Lorcin 380.

Gun was the favorite
of a career felon,

of Danny Flores.

What's his last known?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.120
All right.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.386
Here.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.121
Well, damn.
Let's go pay him a visit.

16:15.930 --> 16:17.318
How you doin'?
Come on in.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.582
Where's the chair?

16:22.630 --> 16:24.063

This will be quick.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.589
I know you're a busy man.

16:25.630 --> 16:27.018
I don't wanna
waste your time.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.808
BILL:
You caught a sales case.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.416
[Danny chuckles]

16:32.460 --> 16:33.802
I ain't trippin' on that.

16:34.290 --> 16:35.541
I can make it go away.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.897
Have you out of here
by tomorrow.

16:38.170 --> 16:40.468
-BISHOP: Is he serious?
-Shh!

16:40.520 --> 16:42.169
BILL: A gun shot one
of my deputies last night.

16:42.690 --> 16:44.385
[laughs]

16:44.430 --> 16:46.250
That's too bad.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.779
BILL: _
Actually, Danny, it was.

16:48.310 --> 16:50.699
Now, we've been
all over town

16:50.740 --> 16:53.482
jamming up anyone we can find
that might have had an issue

16:53.530 --> 16:55.566
with Deputy Luna doing
his sworn duty...

16:55.620 --> 16:57.133
which brings me to you.

16:57.530 --> 16:58.872
'Cause he put you in here.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.793
[chuckles]

17:00.840 --> 17:02.444
Well, I don't
remember him, man.

17:02.490 --> 17:04.572
Well, your prints came up
on a casing

17:04.630 --> 17:05.881
a few feet from his body.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.327
380 caliber.

17:07.370 --> 17:09.543
Which matches
two 380-caliber slugs

17:09.590 --> 17:10.887
that we pulled from Luna.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.190
He's in bad shape.

17:14.510 --> 17:16.466
You're crazy, man.
I was in here, all right.

17:16.510 --> 17:18.899
Did you put a green light
on my deputy?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.120
Your girlfriend has a 380
registered under her name

17:24.170 --> 17:25.649
but reported stolen.

17:25.690 --> 17:27.908
Now, I've never been
great at math.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.176
But I can make 380
plus 380

17:31.220 --> 17:32.300
equals you.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.954
So I'll say it again...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.082
did you put a green light
on my deputy?

17:36.140 --> 17:37.789
Why don't you do yourself
a favor, man,

17:37.830 --> 17:39.650
and get the hell up
out of my face, all right.

17:42.710 --> 17:44.052
You want outta here, right?

17:45.410 --> 17:46.889
Let me tell you
how that works.

17:46.930 --> 17:49.490
Basically, there's one way

17:49.540 --> 17:50.882
or there's another way.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.101
[crashing]

17:52.630 --> 17:54.416
My deputies run this jail.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.639
And they're not
as easy-going as me.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.114
So you wanna walk
out of here tomorrow,

17:59.160 --> 18:00.058
or never?

18:02.380 --> 18:03.597
I can't listen to this.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.857
If anyone were
to hear this--

18:04.900 --> 18:05.980
Relax, Bishop.

18:10.610 --> 18:11.770
All right.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.868
I may have something
for you.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.735
There you go.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.046
He's all right!

18:19.090 --> 18:21.046
He's just
a little dehydrated.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.874
Maybe we get him
a glass of water or something?

18:22.920 --> 18:24.182
Unbelievable.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.356
CADE: Hey, I know
you mean well.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.355
But don't be pulling
on his reins,

18:26.400 --> 18:27.480
not right now.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.882
We need Bill
the way that he was.

18:28.930 --> 18:29.919
Full-tilt.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.050
So we can catch
that bastard

18:31.110 --> 18:32.054
who shot Luna.

18:33.370 --> 18:34.530
I got a bad feeling.

18:34.590 --> 18:36.069
I've seen enough men
and women die

18:36.110 --> 18:37.668
from less than
what he got.

18:38.590 --> 18:39.761
So have I.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.630
DANNY: Okay,
check this out, man.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.461
Couple months ago, I heard
that this gun might've got

18:44.510 --> 18:45.670
to some guy, right?

18:46.470 --> 18:48.074
His name's Marquis Slaughter.

18:48.950 --> 18:50.383
He's with the Rolling 60's.

18:51.340 --> 18:52.466
That's all I know.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.682
Thanks for your time.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.345
Feel better.
Pop the door.

[buzzer sounding]

19:01.700 --> 19:04.009
Marquis Slaughter,
you ever heard of him?

19:04.050 --> 19:06.098
Doesn't ring a bell,
but I'll go ring his.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.133
-I'll go talk to the Mayor.
-Mayor?

19:09.190 --> 19:10.873
He doesn't have jurisdiction
over the Sheriff's Office.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.272
Oh, yes, he does.

19:25.590 --> 19:26.807
It's a web alert.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.721
Congratulations.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.377
I have it set up so that
all news about the Department

19:32.430 --> 19:34.421
comes to me,
and to you,

19:34.470 --> 19:36.165
because you are
the Sheriff and whatnot,

19:36.210 --> 19:37.689
and that way you can
get out in front of it.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.038
Well, if it makes the news,
we're too late already.

19:40.090 --> 19:42.217

On behalf of the acting Sheriff

we have a suspect
in custody,

19:45.830 --> 19:47.263
involved in _
Sergeant Luna's shooting.

-How the hell--
-Acting sheriff?

This dude's somethin'.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.091
[engine starts]

19:58.370 --> 19:59.405
Hey, Jerry,

19:59.450 --> 20:01.145
I said one press conference.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.270
You did that.
Plus one more.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.809
Bill, I tried
to reach you before.

20:04.850 --> 20:05.976
I knew your hands were full.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.509
I tried your assistant.
No answer.

20:07.550 --> 20:09.370
-The people have
a right to know.
-BILL: No.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.024
Not when it's
ass backwards,

20:11.070 --> 20:12.810
saying we have
a suspect in custody.

20:12.860 --> 20:15.021
Maybe you should program my
direct number into your phone

20:15.080 --> 20:15.944
so you know it's me.

20:15.990 --> 20:16.809
Bishop, give us the room.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.464
Everybody.

20:22.780 --> 20:25.305
-Who called you?
-Bill, change is hard.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.568
It's understandable that
deputies in this department

20:27.610 --> 20:29.919
would still feel a connection
to former Sheriff Bradford.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.302
They feel comfortable
reaching out to me.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.225

-All right.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.316
We go now.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.759
[indistinct radio chatter]

34:26.800 --> 34:28.700
Sheriff Hollister,
you're not going anywhere, sir.

34:29.370 --> 34:30.883
Team commander,
we got movement.

34:31.890 --> 34:33.016
_ MAN:_
Hold it! Hold it, guys.

34:33.070 --> 34:34.230
-[door opens]
-MAN: Hold up, hold up.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.157
MRS. MURPHY:
Don't hurt my son!

34:36.200 --> 34:37.713
Show us your hands. Now!

34:37.770 --> 34:39.249
[crying
My son]!

34:39.290 --> 34:41.110
[sobbing]

34:44.080 --> 34:46.071
It's lithium,
just lithium!

34:47.210 --> 34:49.121
I didn't have enough money
to pay for it.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.899
I barely can keep that house,

34:50.950 --> 34:53.293
let alone pay
for my son's pills.

34:53.350 --> 34:55.511
I didn't know.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.219
My son is sick.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.649
-He doesn't understand.
-All right.

34:59.700 --> 35:02.168
Ma'am, does your son
have a gun now?

35:05.970 --> 35:07.358
Yes.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.446
COMMANDER: Sir.

35:08.490 --> 35:10.219
We can take out
the target.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.440
I only want one man.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.104
Not collateral damage.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.588
7You with me?
-Right next to you.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.105
What the hell is he doing?

35:57.930 --> 36:00.194
[man sobbing]

36:07.420 --> 36:09.206
BILL: Donald.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.501
DONALD: Dad?

36:12.640 --> 36:14.335
Yeah, son.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.597
Go away!

36:19.350 --> 36:20.999
I came to apologize.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.169
Can I come in
and just talk to you?

36:25.090 --> 36:26.170
I guess so.

36:34.450 --> 36:36.918
It was me, wasn't it?

36:38.280 --> 36:40.180
Well, let's just talk
about that later, son.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.143
Why don't we go
find your mom.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.019
And we can send
all these folks home.

36:50.250 --> 36:53.151
Coming on one side window.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.723
COMMANDER [on radio]:
Team commander
to Long Rifle 1.

36:54.770 --> 36:56.203
Confirm your deploy.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.423
OFFICER [on radio] :
Long Rifle 1. Sights on.

36:58.470 --> 37:00.119
COMMANDER: Containment,
arrest team's in place.

37:00.170 --> 37:01.865
Long Rifle,
sights on target.

37:01.910 --> 37:03.730
Let's make sure we're watching
each other's backs.

37:03.780 --> 37:05.259
Not losing
any more deputies.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.652
I was looking for you.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.175
I was mad at you.

37:13.010 --> 37:14.352
I saw you...

37:16.190 --> 37:18.226
-You saw me at the store.
-Yes.

37:19.010 --> 37:20.750
I tried to kill you, Dad.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.358
I missed.

37:22.410 --> 37:23.661
I shot that man.

37:24.850 --> 37:26.147
And it's your fault.

37:27.540 --> 37:28.757
It's all your fault!

37:28.810 --> 37:30.107
Because you never loved me!

37:30.160 --> 37:31.058
BILL: Hey...

37:31.900 --> 37:33.026
easy.

37:33.070 --> 37:34.503
Go easy, Donald.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.376
Would you ask
those people to kill me?

37:41.040 --> 37:42.382
If I go for that gun...

37:43.730 --> 37:44.992
they have to.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.903
I heard it on the news.

37:49.650 --> 37:50.696
I won't do that.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.749
The only person...

37:55.400 --> 37:56.697
I hate more than you...

37:57.920 --> 37:58.909
is me.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.577
Stop!

38:08.410 --> 38:09.889
Who's firing?

38:32.830 --> 38:34.821
[helicopter hovering]

38:38.660 --> 38:41.709
["Wave" by Beck playing]

38:50.060 --> 38:55.362
I move away
from this place

38:57.160 --> 39:02.769
In the form
of a disturbance

39:04.420 --> 39:10.461
And enter into the world

39:11.910 --> 39:17.598
Like some tiny distortion

39:32.840 --> 39:34.011
Go home.

39:38.590 --> 39:39.625
We, uh...

39:41.550 --> 39:43.677
We all get to go home
to our families tonight.

39:45.510 --> 39:47.159
Let's do that
every single day.

39:48.290 --> 39:49.427
For each other.

39:54.470 --> 39:55.687
And for Luna.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.404
You should be home.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.009
Off duty.
Never off the clock.

40:27.810 --> 40:29.505
I found this
in the car.

40:36.950 --> 40:39.510
I hope it helps you
find peace.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.697
And I know you hate
hearing these words,

40:44.740 --> 40:46.173
but I am sorry.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.877
MINNICK: Thank you.

41:00.670 --> 41:02.399
[exhales]

41:32.790 --> 41:34.041
This whole damn city...

41:35.230 --> 41:36.652
is always on edge.

41:37.230 --> 41:38.481
Not up here.

41:40.580 --> 41:42.013
We should do this
more often.

41:43.540 --> 41:44.973
We should.

41:49.980 --> 41:52.448
A lot of people ignore
the gray in life.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.800
And you didn't.

41:57.290 --> 41:59.679
Well, last night could
have gone the other way.

42:01.690 --> 42:03.646
My deputies wanted revenge.

42:03.690 --> 42:05.032
A few weeks ago...

42:05.820 --> 42:07.378
that was me.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.568
Well, then,
I like the new you.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.224
Maybe we, uh...

42:18.270 --> 42:19.783
be a little late
to work today.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.966
Just hang here.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.446
I can't.

42:24.060 --> 42:25.140
Why?

42:27.190 --> 42:28.669
-Okay.
-We can do it.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.278
-Okay.
-Come on.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.581
Just five minutes.

42:31.630 --> 42:32.494
[Paula sighs]

42:32.550 --> 42:33.539
All that...

42:34.290 --> 42:35.541
is not going anywhere.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.891
Trust me.

42:40.290 --> 42:42.724
It'll still be there.
Coming at us.

42:44.250 --> 42:47.162
All it takes is one person
to try and change that.

42:49.780 --> 42:52.248
Maybe that person
can be you, Sheriff.

42:55.870 --> 42:57.565
Well, I may need
a little help.
