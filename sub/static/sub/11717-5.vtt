CAPTAIN (over speaker):
The limu lipoa is actually
a type of seaweed.

In fact, the waters of Waikiki

06:59.691 --> 07:01.859
Yeah. For the
last two years.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.411
Before that,
it was, uh, Budapest.

07:04.479 --> 07:07.114

Of course, growing up in foreign
countries with a security detail

07:13.455 --> 07:15.989

is not exactly

07:16.057 --> 07:17.925

07:17.992 --> 07:20.794
Did they, by chance,
have a detail with them

07:20.845 --> 07:22.029
when they went out
last night?

07:22.097 --> 07:23.680
Well, in the Philippines
it's one thing,

but we've been coming to Hawaii
since the girls were little.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.769
I guess we just didn't think
it was necessary.

07:28.836 --> 07:31.305

going to the movies.

07:31.356 --> 07:33.006
Don't blame yourself.
We're going to find Robin.

07:33.057 --> 07:34.841
We are.

07:34.893 --> 07:36.343
We are. I promise.

07:41.866 --> 07:43.350

Aloha.

08:18.853 --> 08:21.221
You know, it's possible that
your daughters were targeted

08:21.272 --> 08:22.940
because of your ambassadorship.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.609
Did you make any enemies
during your time abroad?

08:25.693 --> 08:27.727

It comes with
the territory.

08:31.366 --> 08:32.566
How about in the Philippines
itself?

08:32.616 --> 08:37.371
The U.S. gives a lot of aid
to that country.

08:37.422 --> 08:39.289
Most of the population
is grateful for our assistance.

08:39.374 --> 08:41.174
Yeah, but not everybody
appreciates the help.

08:41.241 --> 08:42.741
I mean, there's always
radical elements

08:42.794 --> 08:44.545
who resent
our presence.

08:44.596 --> 08:46.213
Michael, did any of
them ever threaten you?

08:46.264 --> 08:49.650
Office receives
dozens of threats.

08:49.717 --> 08:52.553
The security bureau
keeps all of that on file.

08:52.604 --> 08:55.222
Mrs. Reeves, you were a founding
partner in Sowersby Financial.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.307
Is it true
that you recently sold

08:57.392 --> 08:59.309
your stake
in that company?

08:59.394 --> 09:00.894
Yes, but how is that relevant?

09:00.945 --> 09:02.396
Well, because, ma'am,

09:02.447 --> 09:04.531
you just cashed out of Sowersby
for over $12 million.

09:04.599 --> 09:05.849
If we have that information,

09:05.917 --> 09:07.868
it's safe to assume that
other people do, too.

09:07.935 --> 09:10.654
What...? Are you saying Amanda's
dead 'cause I have money?

09:10.738 --> 09:12.623
I'm sorry, uh, ma'am,

09:12.707 --> 09:14.992
these high-profile cases
are usually

09:15.076 --> 09:16.493
about money.

09:16.578 --> 09:18.795
Then how come there
hasn't been a ransom demand?

09:20.281 --> 09:21.298
I don't know.

09:37.131 --> 09:38.599
Oh!

09:38.650 --> 09:39.600
Hi.

09:39.651 --> 09:40.934
Yeah.

09:40.985 --> 09:44.488
Um... Steve had to leave
for work,

09:44.572 --> 09:46.189
and he told me I should
just let myself out,

09:46.274 --> 09:47.407
so...

09:47.475 --> 09:49.526
Um... You must be...

09:49.611 --> 09:51.411
The sister. I'm Mary.
Yeah.

09:51.479 --> 09:53.947
I'm just visiting from L.A.

09:53.998 --> 09:56.083
Big night last night.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.200
Hmm?

09:57.285 --> 09:59.486
Old house. Thin walls.

09:59.554 --> 10:00.987
Oh, God!

10:01.039 --> 10:02.756
Yeah. You said
that a lot.

10:02.823 --> 10:04.007
It's embarrassing.

10:04.092 --> 10:05.042
Don't sweat it.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.493
I just broke up
with my boyfriend,

10:06.561 --> 10:08.929
so I plan on having
a lot of guys over soon.

10:08.996 --> 10:10.997
So it'll be a fair fight.

10:16.471 --> 10:17.471
Hey.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.390
Hey. Checked with State.

10:20.475 --> 10:21.642
No credible threats
against the ambassador

10:21.693 --> 10:23.226
in the last
three months.

10:23.311 --> 10:24.945
KONO: Okay, so this doesn't add
up-- why kill one girl

10:25.012 --> 10:26.730
and keep the other one alive?
Well, if it's a ransom attempt,

10:26.814 --> 10:29.316
it could be to show
that they mean business.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.850
HPD has a unit at the house.
Still no ransom call.

10:30.902 --> 10:32.736
So we got no motive.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.237
Okay, so we focus on
how the girls were abducted.

10:34.322 --> 10:36.823
75% of kidnappings

10:36.874 --> 10:39.693
are usually carried out by
people the victims already knew.

10:39.744 --> 10:41.628
We ran a background check
on the ambassador's staff,

10:41.696 --> 10:43.413
and everyone seems clean.
What about the new guy?

10:43.498 --> 10:45.031
That security consultant,
Russell Ellison.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.167
His story checks out.

10:47.218 --> 10:49.252
Ambassador just flew him
in from the mainland,

10:49.337 --> 10:51.138
and, uh, his plane touched down

10:51.205 --> 10:52.539
(cell ringing)
after the girls were abducted.

10:52.590 --> 10:54.591
McGarrett.

10:54.676 --> 10:55.759
On our way.

10:55.843 --> 10:58.878
Let's go, big guy.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.381
MAX: Just got back
the toxicology report.

11:01.432 --> 11:04.484
The victim had
benzodiazepine in her blood.

11:04.552 --> 11:07.771
You may be more familiar
with its street name-- roofies.

11:07.855 --> 11:09.272
Yeah, it's a date rape drug.

11:09.357 --> 11:11.608

I don't know, honestly. I...

16:37.318 --> 16:38.735

his last name.

his phone number.

to Kang?

16:42.857 --> 16:44.557

(women screaming)

23:11.964 --> 23:13.615
Building's secure.

23:13.666 --> 23:14.449
Where's Robin?

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
She's not here.

23:21.808 --> 23:24.643
STEVE:
Robin Reeves-- where is she?

23:24.727 --> 23:26.461
I never see that girl.

23:26.512 --> 23:27.796
CHIN: Well, seeing as
you're not even

23:27.847 --> 23:29.314
bothering to look,

23:29.382 --> 23:31.566
maybe you'll remember that she
was with her sister Amanda,

23:31.634 --> 23:33.268
and maybe you'll want to know
that she's dead now.

23:33.319 --> 23:35.303
I want you read my Miranda

23:35.354 --> 23:36.605
right now.

23:36.656 --> 23:38.807
Preferably in Chinese.

23:38.858 --> 23:40.859
My English not so good.

23:42.995 --> 23:44.246
What you do...

23:44.313 --> 23:46.481
What you doing?
What you doing?

23:46.532 --> 23:47.982
(speaks Chinese)

23:48.034 --> 23:49.150
No! Give me!

23:49.202 --> 23:50.151
Sit down!
Give me!

23:50.203 --> 23:51.203
Shut up.

23:53.489 --> 23:55.173
Give us a minute.

23:55.258 --> 23:57.209
Yeah, sure.

24:09.555 --> 24:11.556
(indistinct radio transmission)

24:14.777 --> 24:16.695
She ordered the kidnapping
of the Reeves sisters,

24:16.779 --> 24:18.697
but it wasn't for
the prostitution ring.

24:18.781 --> 24:20.515
- She tell you where Robin is?
- Doesn't know.

24:20.566 --> 24:22.451
According to her,
the Reeves girls never even

24:22.518 --> 24:24.152
passed through here.

24:24.203 --> 24:26.154
A private buyer paid her
50,000 to abduct them

24:26.205 --> 24:28.123
and hand them over.
Said the kidnapping was

24:28.190 --> 24:29.241
a freelance job.

24:29.325 --> 24:30.876
So it had nothing
to do with sex trade.

24:30.960 --> 24:31.877
Someone was targeting
them specifically.

24:31.961 --> 24:33.027
You get a name on a buyer?

24:33.079 --> 24:34.713
All she had was

24:34.797 --> 24:36.331
the phone number she used
to communicate with the guy.

24:36.382 --> 24:38.500
Said she was paid by wire.

24:38.551 --> 24:39.534
This will help.

24:39.585 --> 24:40.886
How'd you get her to talk?

24:40.970 --> 24:43.004
Told her the dog
would be put down

24:43.055 --> 24:44.589
once she went to lockup.

24:44.674 --> 24:46.408
Promised I'd find it a home.

24:46.476 --> 24:48.510
<i>If</i> she cooperated.

24:53.716 --> 24:55.901
What?

24:55.985 --> 24:57.986
It's not like
it's the dog's fault.

25:01.056 --> 25:03.492
CHIN: <i>So I ran the phone number</i>
<i>on our private buyer.</i>

25:03.559 --> 25:05.360
Turns out,
the calls were made from

25:05.411 --> 25:06.411
a disposable
cell phone.

25:06.496 --> 25:07.829
Which is untraceable.
That's right.

25:07.897 --> 25:10.064
But I was able
to pull the call logs.

25:10.116 --> 25:13.568
And get this: since the
Reeves sisters went missing,

25:13.619 --> 25:15.504
three calls were placed
from that cell phone

25:15.571 --> 25:16.705
to the ambassador's
private number.

25:16.756 --> 25:18.006
So you think
that he's somehow involved

25:18.073 --> 25:19.174
in his own daughter's
disappearance?

25:19.241 --> 25:20.158
No.

25:20.226 --> 25:21.710
No, this is a kidnap and ransom.

25:21.761 --> 25:23.678
Yeah, they're calling
the ambassador to make demands.

25:23.746 --> 25:26.214
That's why he brought
Ellison in

25:26.265 --> 25:27.265
after the girls
went missing.

25:27.350 --> 25:28.583
Ellison,
the security consultant.

25:28.634 --> 25:29.584
I will bet you

25:29.635 --> 25:31.603
he's not
a security consultant.

25:31.687 --> 25:33.555
- That guy is a K&R specialist.
- What's K&R?

25:33.606 --> 25:35.357
STEVE, DANNY and CHIN:
Kidnap and ransom.

25:35.424 --> 25:36.691
It's a type of insurance.

25:36.759 --> 25:39.394
Look, if the policyholder
gets abducted,

25:39.445 --> 25:42.197
the company comes in,
they pay the ransom

25:42.264 --> 25:43.982
and they supervise the exchange
with the kidnappers.

25:44.066 --> 25:47.702
And these guys got a tendency to
obstruct police investigations.

25:47.770 --> 25:49.905
So, if Ellison
is handling the drop,

25:49.956 --> 25:52.791
that explains why
the ambassador lied to us.

26:04.503 --> 26:05.971
Is your husband home?

26:06.055 --> 26:07.672
We uh, we need
to have a word.

26:07.757 --> 26:10.124
No, I... he had to step
out for a meeting.

26:10.176 --> 26:12.143
With Mr. Ellison?

26:14.180 --> 26:15.597
I don't know.

26:15.648 --> 26:16.514
What's going on?

26:16.599 --> 26:18.850
Mrs. Reeves, we know

26:18.935 --> 26:21.403
that the kidnappers have been in
communication with your husband.

26:24.807 --> 26:27.025
He hired Russell Ellison
to broker the deal,

26:27.109 --> 26:29.110
isn't that right?

26:31.197 --> 26:33.949
Sarah.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.700
Sarah, if you know something,
you have to tell them.

26:35.785 --> 26:37.986
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

26:40.006 --> 26:43.458
Last call came in an hour ago,
and the man on the end said

26:43.509 --> 26:44.876
that if we paid the money,

26:44.961 --> 26:46.127
we'd get Robin back.

26:46.178 --> 26:47.429
Okay, so your husband
and Ellison

26:47.496 --> 26:48.797
have gone to pay the ransom?

26:50.833 --> 26:53.167
Please, I just want
my daughter back.

27:02.999 --> 27:05.316
SARAH: <i>So, as soon as the kidnappers</i>
<i>made contact,</i>

27:05.368 --> 27:07.151
Michael called Mr. Ellison.

27:07.203 --> 27:09.421
He flew in with the money.

27:09.488 --> 27:10.839
He monitored all the calls.

27:10.923 --> 27:12.040
He told Michael exactly

27:12.124 --> 27:13.992
what to do and say.
Did your husband say

27:14.043 --> 27:15.493
where the transaction
was taking place?

27:15.544 --> 27:18.296
No, no. Mr. Ellison wouldn't
let him give me any details.

27:18.347 --> 27:19.965
Did Ellison ask you to lie?

27:20.016 --> 27:22.667
He said involving the police

27:22.718 --> 27:24.335
would only put Robin
in more danger.

27:24.387 --> 27:26.337
(cell phone ringing)

27:26.389 --> 27:28.056
Excuse me.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.224
Yeah?

27:29.308 --> 27:30.308
I just traced the money trail

27:30.359 --> 27:31.559
for that private buyer
who paid for

27:31.644 --> 27:32.644
the abduction
of the Reeves sisters.

27:32.695 --> 27:33.979
Uh-huh.

27:34.030 --> 27:35.680
The payment was wired from
a bank in the Philippines.

27:35.731 --> 27:36.681
CHIN:
The account belongs to

27:36.732 --> 27:38.783
a Carlos Bagoyo.

27:38.851 --> 27:40.402
Known member of
the National Liberation Front,

27:40.486 --> 27:41.519
operational in rural Luzon.

27:41.587 --> 27:44.322
They bombed a military base
there in '08.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.041
Lately they've taken to
targeting U.S. troops

27:46.125 --> 27:47.292
within the country.

27:47.359 --> 27:49.210
Of course they have.
Because we support

27:49.295 --> 27:51.046
the democratically-elected
government that keeps them

27:51.130 --> 27:52.464
out of power.

27:52.531 --> 27:53.832
Doesn't sound like they'd be
interested in a ransom.

27:53.883 --> 27:54.833
They're not.

27:54.884 --> 27:55.967
They didn't kidnap his daughters

27:56.035 --> 27:57.168
for money, this is political.

27:57.219 --> 27:58.553
If they're targeting
the ambassador,

27:58.638 --> 27:59.871
he must have
something they want.

27:59.922 --> 28:01.589
Yeah.

28:01.674 --> 28:04.676
And he just dropped his security
detail to go meet with them.

28:06.595 --> 28:08.596
Hey.

28:08.681 --> 28:11.049
Listen, all the cars
in the DSB motor pool

28:11.100 --> 28:12.901
have vehicle
transponders, okay?

28:12.985 --> 28:15.553
I need a location on the
car the ambassador left in.

28:47.636 --> 28:49.437
Government plates. It's him.

28:52.274 --> 28:53.725
Tires are still warm.

28:53.776 --> 28:55.760
They can't have
gone too far.

28:55.811 --> 28:57.395
Ellison probably sent
the ambassador in solo

28:57.446 --> 28:59.531
to make the swap,
but he'll be nearby

28:59.598 --> 29:01.399
monitoring with a tac team
to make sure it doesn't bad.

29:01.450 --> 29:03.702
And you know what?

29:03.769 --> 29:05.487
I may have a way to figure out

29:05.571 --> 29:06.621
where he's running
surveillance from.

29:06.706 --> 29:08.439
Yeah, I figured you would.

29:08.491 --> 29:09.908
You're gonna like this.

29:09.959 --> 29:11.960
(cell phone ringing)

29:21.420 --> 29:23.138
Was wondering
when you were gonna call.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.006
You get in late last night?

29:25.091 --> 29:26.624
I actually haven't
been home yet.

29:26.675 --> 29:28.292
Interesting.

29:28.344 --> 29:30.294
No, no, it's not
what it sounds like.

29:30.346 --> 29:31.730
I caught a high-priority case.

29:31.797 --> 29:33.348
Okay, why am I
getting the feeling

29:33.432 --> 29:35.400
that you're about to ask me
for another favor?

29:35.467 --> 29:37.235
Listen, I'll make it up to you,
all right?

29:37.302 --> 29:38.570
We'll finally get that dinner,

29:38.637 --> 29:40.739
and you'll get to taste
the best steak on the island.

29:40.806 --> 29:41.723
Who you talking to?

29:41.791 --> 29:43.274
All right, you got yourself

29:43.325 --> 29:45.110
a deal.

29:45.161 --> 29:46.611
What do you need?

29:46.662 --> 29:48.780
PACOM has a satellite
dedicated to Honolulu harbor.

29:48.831 --> 29:51.149
Can you use it to run a scan
on radio traffic?

29:51.200 --> 29:54.018
Yeah, what am I looking for?

29:54.086 --> 29:57.122
Uh, spread spectrum signal
in the 400 MHz range.

29:57.173 --> 29:59.007
Type used by high-end
surveillance gear.

29:59.091 --> 30:01.009
All right, one sec.

30:01.093 --> 30:02.493
Thanks, Cath.

30:02.545 --> 30:04.512
Oh, Catherine.
I should've known.

30:04.597 --> 30:06.264
That's who you were getting
right with last night.

30:06.331 --> 30:07.298
That's stunning detective work.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.767
Well done.
You know, it's amazing.

30:08.834 --> 30:12.771
Now, she-she catches bad guys
for you and she sleeps with you.

30:12.838 --> 30:13.938
Does she cook, too?

30:14.006 --> 30:15.807
Yeah, she does.
She's a great cook.

30:15.858 --> 30:17.725
MAN: Roger that. We've got eyes on
the northern avenue of approach.

30:17.793 --> 30:19.010
What's your status?

30:19.061 --> 30:20.728
All right, I think I got a hit
on your frequency.

30:20.813 --> 30:21.863
I'm tying you in right now.

30:21.947 --> 30:23.014
ELLISON:
Overwatch on Reeves is good.

30:23.065 --> 30:24.515
We're standing by.

30:24.567 --> 30:25.850
All right, that's our boy.

30:25.901 --> 30:28.236
Can you get a vector
on the signal source?

30:30.289 --> 30:33.374
All right,
the west end of the dock.

30:33.459 --> 30:35.994
It's coming from
a shipping container.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.697
What are you doing?
Lower your weapons!

30:39.748 --> 30:40.832
Right now! Lower your gun!

30:40.883 --> 30:42.217
You can't come in here.
You're gonna get

30:42.301 --> 30:43.868
this girl killed.
We're gonna get this girl killed?

30:43.919 --> 30:44.969
Hey!

30:45.037 --> 30:46.471
You obstructed
our investigation!

30:46.538 --> 30:47.672
Now unless
your men are ready

30:47.723 --> 30:49.174
to shoot a couple of cops,

30:49.225 --> 30:51.559
tell them to holster
their weapons now.

30:51.644 --> 30:53.178
Right now, buddy.

30:58.601 --> 31:00.235
Where's the ambassador?

31:00.319 --> 31:02.020
He's in position for the drop.

31:02.071 --> 31:03.321
Pull him out now.

31:03.388 --> 31:04.722
With all due respect,

31:04.773 --> 31:07.025
my team specializes
in these situations.

31:07.076 --> 31:08.359
We want to get Robin

31:08.410 --> 31:09.560
home to her family.

31:09.612 --> 31:10.979
Of course you do,
because if you don't,

31:11.046 --> 31:12.230
your firm is on the hook for

31:12.281 --> 31:13.698
six million, right?

31:13.749 --> 31:16.067
The man who kidnapped
the ambassador's daughters

31:16.118 --> 31:17.669
is a part of a Filipino
terrorist group.

31:17.736 --> 31:19.570
Sir, they just arrived.

31:19.622 --> 31:21.422
This is not about
cash, gentlemen.

31:21.507 --> 31:22.423
They lured him in.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.242
STEVE:
Look at that,

31:24.293 --> 31:25.343
Robin is not with them.

31:25.410 --> 31:28.379
Patch me into
the ambassador.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.748
ELLISON:
All right, listen, they're here.

31:30.799 --> 31:34.085
I want you to be calm and do
exactly as we already discussed.

31:50.786 --> 31:52.153
You know who I am?

31:54.206 --> 31:56.607
Carlos Bagoyo.

31:56.659 --> 31:57.608
You're an operative

31:57.660 --> 31:59.777
of the NLF,

31:59.828 --> 32:01.980
responsible for
the Zamboanga bombings

32:02.047 --> 32:04.448
that killed 78 people.

32:07.136 --> 32:09.087
I see you read
your security briefs.

32:09.138 --> 32:10.138
Where is she?

32:12.174 --> 32:13.624
Where's my daughter?

32:13.676 --> 32:14.809
She's nearby.

32:14.894 --> 32:16.144
When we get
what we want,

32:16.228 --> 32:19.097
we will release her.

32:19.148 --> 32:21.266
You didn't come all this way
for my money,

32:21.317 --> 32:22.633
did you?

32:22.685 --> 32:25.803
I'm afraid not, Ambassador.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.191
We came for you.

32:38.912 --> 32:40.829
What do you want?

32:44.625 --> 32:49.011
Your country sends military aid
to the Philippine regime.

32:49.079 --> 32:50.680
You put guns in the hands

32:50.747 --> 32:52.765
of soldiers that kill
our sons and brothers.

32:52.850 --> 32:54.267
I don't understand.

32:54.351 --> 32:57.586
There's a U.S. shipment of M-4
machine guns en route to Manila.

32:57.638 --> 33:00.773
You're gonna tell me where they
are right now and we're gonna

33:00.858 --> 33:03.059
use those weapons to
take our country back.

33:03.110 --> 33:04.260
I don't have that kind
of information.

33:04.311 --> 33:05.261
As ambassador,
you coordinate military aid

33:05.312 --> 33:06.612
with the State Department,

33:06.697 --> 33:11.267
which means you have access
to the classified server.

33:11.318 --> 33:13.452
Now if you ever want to see
your daughter alive again,

33:13.537 --> 33:15.905
log in.

33:15.956 --> 33:17.606
STEVE: All right, he finds out
where that shipment is,

33:17.658 --> 33:18.875
he can send a team in
to hijack it.

33:18.942 --> 33:20.076
We cannot let him
get to those weapons.

33:20.127 --> 33:21.443
Tell the perimeter team
to gear up.

33:21.495 --> 33:23.129
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

33:23.213 --> 33:25.131
We're running out of options.
We gotta move in.

33:25.215 --> 33:27.216
We don't need to do anything.
You need to pull your men out

33:27.284 --> 33:30.119
so my partner and I
can clean up your mess.

33:30.170 --> 33:33.389
Move out now.
I'm not gonna tell you again!

33:33.456 --> 33:34.473
Come on.

33:40.013 --> 33:42.932
Your wife already
lost one daughter.

33:42.983 --> 33:44.901
Are you prepared to tell
her your other child died

33:44.985 --> 33:47.270
because you wouldn't
do what was asked?

33:48.655 --> 33:49.805
Ambassador,
this is Commander McGarrett.

33:49.856 --> 33:51.774
Stay calm, listen.

33:51.825 --> 33:54.476
Tell them that you're willing
to cooperate,

33:54.528 --> 33:56.746
but first you need
to see your daughter.

33:56.813 --> 33:58.314
We cannot move in until we know
where she is, you understand?

33:58.365 --> 34:01.450
Fingerprint and password,
Ambassador, now!

34:01.501 --> 34:02.785
Please trust me.

34:02.836 --> 34:04.320
Do as I ask you.

34:04.371 --> 34:05.487
Tell Carlos you're willing
to cooperate,

34:05.539 --> 34:08.657
but first you need to see Robin.

34:13.347 --> 34:16.165
Ambassador, do it, please.

34:16.216 --> 34:19.768
You're asking me to commit
treason against my country.

34:19.835 --> 34:22.170
And I will do as you ask,

34:22.222 --> 34:25.024
but not until
I know she's safe.

34:26.059 --> 34:28.677
I want to see Robin.

34:31.531 --> 34:34.183
(speaks Tagalog)

34:34.234 --> 34:36.118
She's on her way.

34:36.186 --> 34:38.621
They're bringing Robin in.
We need to get a visual.

34:38.688 --> 34:40.322
You're kidding me.
No, I'm not kidding.

34:40.373 --> 34:42.358
Come here. Look, this one
controls the camera feed,

34:42.409 --> 34:44.126
the joystick is for
pans and zoom, okay?

34:44.194 --> 34:47.163
It's just like <i>Ms. Pac-Man.</i>
It's very easy.

34:48.665 --> 34:50.366
They're holding the ambassador
on dry dock number seven.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.368
And the daughter?
She's not on-site,

34:52.418 --> 34:54.637
but Bagoyo has just agreed
to provide proof of life.

34:54.704 --> 34:57.139
We think he's holding her
in a nearby location.

34:57.207 --> 34:58.540
As soon as we get eyes

34:58.592 --> 34:59.759
on Robin,
we can move in.

34:59.843 --> 35:01.844
Okay, we got a boat coming in.

35:01.895 --> 35:03.145
KONO:
Got her.

35:03.213 --> 35:04.880
All right, that's us.
We're going, Danny.

35:04.931 --> 35:06.265
Okay, I'll just be here

35:06.350 --> 35:08.234
in the penalty box.

35:17.995 --> 35:19.728
We still clear?

35:19.780 --> 35:21.063
Roger that.

35:39.132 --> 35:41.083
Daddy!

35:42.102 --> 35:44.186
Robin.

35:44.254 --> 35:46.022
Sweetie.

35:59.619 --> 36:01.871
Go.

36:06.443 --> 36:07.710
Okay, hold up, hold up.

36:07.777 --> 36:09.795
You got two
at the south entrance.

36:11.965 --> 36:14.633
One of them's making the rounds,
coming your way right now.

36:18.305 --> 36:20.622
He's coming up right behind you.

36:23.427 --> 36:27.629
He'll be on you
in about ten seconds.

36:30.183 --> 36:31.800
Wait for it.

36:31.852 --> 36:33.235
Now, now.

36:34.604 --> 36:35.654
Oh!

36:48.668 --> 36:50.619
BAGOYO:
That's enough.

36:50.670 --> 36:52.121
No, no, no, no, please, please?!

36:52.172 --> 36:54.957
Ambassador,
you've seen your daughter.

36:55.008 --> 36:56.509
Now log in.

37:07.471 --> 37:10.139
My patience is wearing thin,
Ambassador.

37:10.190 --> 37:12.691
Do it or she dies.

37:32.862 --> 37:35.197
Robin?

37:37.417 --> 37:38.534
It's okay.

37:38.585 --> 37:39.718
You guys okay?
Yeah.

37:47.561 --> 37:49.345
(grunts)

38:02.892 --> 38:06.028
(grunting)

38:33.940 --> 38:36.425
All right.

38:36.476 --> 38:38.427
Listen, I'm man enough to know
when I'm wrong.

38:38.478 --> 38:40.813
Thank you.
You both have great instincts,

38:40.897 --> 38:43.265
and if you ever consider

38:43.333 --> 38:45.234
coming down to the
private sector,

38:45.285 --> 38:46.819
you should give me a call.

38:46.903 --> 38:49.905
Men with your skill sets
deserve to be compensated.

38:49.956 --> 38:51.273
I know.

38:51.324 --> 38:53.108
Well, thank you very much.
I totally agree.

38:55.378 --> 38:56.829
Oh, what are you doing?
(handcuffs clicking)

38:56.913 --> 38:58.797
I'm getting compensation.

38:58.882 --> 39:01.000
You obstructed a
criminal investigation.

39:01.084 --> 39:03.168
That is an
arrestable offense.

39:03.253 --> 39:04.887
ELLISON:
Well, you and I both know

39:04.954 --> 39:06.455
that the charges
will never stick.

39:06.506 --> 39:08.674
Yeah, maybe not, but it's
going to take your firm

39:08.758 --> 39:11.960
at least 24 hours to get a
lawyer here from Los Angeles.

39:12.012 --> 39:14.129
I'm gonna make sure that
you spend that time in jail.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.964
Book him, Danno.

39:16.016 --> 39:17.966
You know, I got to be honest.

39:18.018 --> 39:19.518
I actually didn't mind that one.

39:19.603 --> 39:20.519
Really?
Yeah.

39:20.604 --> 39:23.105
Move.

39:27.477 --> 39:29.478
(sighs)

39:29.529 --> 39:31.196
You saved a girl's
life today.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.482
Just doing the job
you hired me for.

39:33.533 --> 39:35.834
Maybe so,

39:35.919 --> 39:39.255
but I made a promise
to a friend and...

39:39.322 --> 39:41.823
you let me keep it.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.959
Thank you.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.629
Hey, you okay?

39:47.664 --> 39:49.665
Yeah.

40:18.995 --> 40:21.981
♪ ♪

40:31.925 --> 40:36.895
Okay, to, uh, let me see--
well, how about this?

40:37.931 --> 40:39.648
To finally getting around
to dinner.

40:39.716 --> 40:42.017
Yes.

40:42.068 --> 40:44.386
Cheers.
Cheers.

40:45.388 --> 40:46.488
Mmm.

40:46.556 --> 40:47.906
All right, well, I don't
know about the food,

40:47.991 --> 40:51.827
but the view
here is amazing.

40:51.894 --> 40:53.061
How do you like
your steak?

40:53.113 --> 40:55.581
Bloody.

40:55.665 --> 40:56.615
That's my kind of girl.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.701
Think it'll be ready
in a minute.

41:00.704 --> 41:02.621
You know what?

41:02.706 --> 41:03.622
What?

41:03.707 --> 41:05.407
Make it medium.

41:07.594 --> 41:09.795
Oh, oh, hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah.

41:09.879 --> 41:11.213
Aah!
