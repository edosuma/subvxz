"Embiggens?"
Hm, I never heard that word

01:41.059 --> 01:42.310
before I moved to Springfield.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.520
I don't know why.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.938
It's a perfectly
cromulent word.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.777
Now, you all know

01:50.860 --> 01:54.030
Springfield's 200th birthday
is only a week away.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.866
Every class will do its part
to make our local Bicentennial

01:56.950 --> 01:59.536
just as memorable
as our national Bicentennial.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.205
Of course, you children
are too young to remember that

02:02.288 --> 02:04.332
with the possible exception
of Kearney.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.709
Those tall ships really lifted

02:06.793 --> 02:09.170
the nation's spirits
after Watergate.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.839
To celebrate our Bicentennial

02:10.922 --> 02:12.632
all 20 of you
will write an essay

02:12.715 --> 02:14.300
about Jebediah Springfield.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.219
And the best 18
will be put on file

02:16.302 --> 02:17.428
in the school library

02:17.512 --> 02:19.472
available to anyone
who requests them.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.849
Can we do illustrations?

02:20.932 --> 02:21.850
No.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.644
Hey...

02:24.727 --> 02:25.895
they need volunteers

02:25.979 --> 02:28.148
to play old-timey people
in the parade.

02:28.231 --> 02:31.734
Look, I can be a butter churner,
a typhoid carrier...

02:31.818 --> 02:33.403
an apprentice.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.029
I think I'll be
an apprentice, Marge.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.447
What kind
of apprentice?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.533
That's for my master
to decide.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.742
How about town crier?

02:39.826 --> 02:40.743
You'd be great at that.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.078
Do you think so?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.538
Well, yeah, Dad, you're
a big fat loudmouth.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.165
And you can walk
when you have to.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.834
Well, if you kids
believe in me that much,

02:47.917 --> 02:50.044
I'll give it my best shot.

Excuse me.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.406
I didn't mean
to startle you

03:18.489 --> 03:20.533
but I do love
to talk Jebediah.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.493
Even when I'm
drinking my chicory.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.996
I'm the curator,
Hollis Hurlbut.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.372
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.541
I'm here to research
a report on Jebediah.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.834
Oh, you're in for a treat.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.377
You know, some historians

03:31.461 --> 03:34.088
consider Jebediah Springfield
a minor patriot.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.633
But I think you'll find
he's easily the equal

03:36.716 --> 03:39.510
of William Dawes
or even Samuel Otis.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.893
Congratulations, Ned.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.103
-You are our new town crier.
-D'oh!

03:49.187 --> 03:50.897
May your shrill nasal voice

03:50.980 --> 03:53.191
ring throughout our streets
and brains.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.194

04:21.177 --> 04:23.179
Good God, he is fabulous.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.391
He's embiggened that role
with his cromulent performance.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.351
Top notch criering, I admit.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.395
But the hat and bell
belong to Flanders,

04:30.478 --> 04:31.729
so no dice.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.940
Oh-ho-ho, they're just
family heirlooms.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.401
That shouldn't stand in the way
of Homer taking my job.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.610
Less chat, more hat.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.780
-(fabric ripping)
-Woo-hoo!

04:40.863 --> 04:42.740
Hear ye, hear ye.

04:42.824 --> 04:47.036
The Homer Broadcasting System

04:47.120 --> 04:48.788

04:48.871 --> 04:50.581

04:50.665 --> 04:52.333
You're to restrict
your criering to the parade

04:52.417 --> 04:54.627
and selected pre-approved
publicity events.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.628
Okay.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.635
This case holds
our most treasured exhibit.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.596
Objects owned and
used by Jebediah.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.056
Here's his fife

05:07.140 --> 05:09.892
upon which he sounded
the sweet note of freedom.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.728
His hatchet,
which he hacked

05:11.811 --> 05:13.354
at the chains of oppression,

05:13.438 --> 05:14.522
and his...

05:14.605 --> 05:15.523
chamber pot.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.566
Wow!

05:16.649 --> 05:18.109
(bell dings)

05:18.192 --> 05:21.779
Excuse me, my microwave
Johnnycakes are ready.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.334

05:35.501 --> 05:37.712

05:39.464 --> 05:44.010
"The secret confessions

05:44.093 --> 05:45.887
"Know ye who read this

05:45.970 --> 05:48.765
there is more to my life
than history records..."

05:48.848 --> 05:52.018
Firstly, I did not tame
the legendary buffalo.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.562
It was already tame.
I merely shot it.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.774
Secondly, I have not always
been known

05:57.857 --> 06:00.276
as Jebediah Springfield.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.278
Until 1796,

06:02.362 --> 06:06.532
I was Hans Sprungfeld,
murderous pirate.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.869
And the half-wits of this town
will never learn the truth.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.829
(evil cackling)

06:13.706 --> 06:15.500
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."

06:15.583 --> 06:17.085
Oh, my God!

06:17.168 --> 06:19.295
Our town hero is a fraud.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.340
"I write this confession
so that my infamy will live on

06:22.423 --> 06:26.677
long after my body has succumbed
to my infectious diphtheria."

06:26.761 --> 06:27.678
Ew.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.638
(yells)

06:29.806 --> 06:31.766
Ugh. Agh. Ugh. Agh.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.649
HOLLIS: Here's Johnnycakes.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.735
Is everything okay?

06:42.819 --> 06:43.986
You look a bit flushed.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.154
Oh, it's just
the excitement

06:45.238 --> 06:46.614
of studying Jebediah.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.449
Sounds like
you've come down

06:48.533 --> 06:51.244
with a serious case
of "Jebeditis."

06:51.327 --> 06:53.830
Just when I was getting over
my "Chester A. Arthritis."

06:53.913 --> 06:56.249
(both chuckling)

06:56.332 --> 06:58.251
You had arthritis?

06:58.334 --> 06:59.460
Um... no.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.214
(bell ringing)

07:03.297 --> 07:05.675
Hear ye, hear ye!
What's for breakfast?

07:05.758 --> 07:06.759
Toast.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.970
I don't understand thee, Marge.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.597
Hmm. Ye olde toast.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.683
Ooh!

07:13.766 --> 07:15.435
What would you say
if I told you

07:15.518 --> 07:17.270
that Jebediah Springfield
wasn't as great

07:17.353 --> 07:19.564
as he's cracked
up to be? Look.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.232
Jebediah was really
a vicious pirate

07:21.315 --> 07:23.067
named Hans Sprungfeld.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.361
His tongue was bitten off
by a Turk

07:25.445 --> 07:27.113
in a grog house fight.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.489
No tongue, eh?

07:28.573 --> 07:31.409
How did he talk
and eat and laugh and love?

07:31.492 --> 07:34.454
He had a prosthetic tongue
made out of silver.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.039
Yes. That'd do.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.834
He was one of the
evilest men of the 1780s.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.919
He even tried to kill
George Washington.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.629
The dastard!

07:49.135 --> 07:50.761
Give me all your money.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.805
Never!

07:52.889 --> 07:54.599
(laughing)

07:56.392 --> 07:59.270
(both grunting)

08:06.611 --> 08:07.904
Ooh! Ow!

08:07.987 --> 08:10.531
I got the white
stars you wanted

08:10.615 --> 08:12.116
but I couldn't find
any red hearts

08:12.200 --> 08:14.368
yellow moons or
green clovers.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.078
Well, I'll use it,

08:16.162 --> 08:18.748
but I'm not paying for it.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.417
The next time Hans
Sprungfeld was seen

08:21.501 --> 08:22.877
he had changed his name

08:22.960 --> 08:24.587
to Jebediah Springfield.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.838
Lisa, honey,

08:25.922 --> 08:27.924
when my family first
came to this state,

08:28.007 --> 08:31.844
they had a choice of living
in Springfield or Stenchburg.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.722
You know why they
chose Springfield?

08:34.805 --> 08:36.140
Because everyone knows
Jebediah Springfield

08:36.224 --> 08:38.476
was a true American hero,
end of story!

08:40.269 --> 08:41.187
I believe you, honey.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.480
You do?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.148
Of course I do.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.566
You're always right
about this type of thing

08:45.650 --> 08:47.735
and for once, I want in
on the ground floor.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.655
Oh, thanks, Dad.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.991
Ralph, "A," Janey, "A,"

08:54.075 --> 08:55.701
and Lisa, for your--

08:55.785 --> 08:56.953
(clearing throat)
essay,

08:57.036 --> 09:00.331
"Jebediah Springfield:
Super Fraud," "F."

09:00.414 --> 09:01.541
But it's all true.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.125
Ah! This is nothing

09:03.209 --> 09:06.087
but dead-white-male bashing
from a P.C. thug.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.631
It's women like you
who keep the rest of us

09:08.714 --> 09:10.049
from landing a husband.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.593
Well, nice talking to you.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.178
(sobbing)

09:16.389 --> 09:17.890
(door slams)

09:17.974 --> 09:19.267
Lisa?

09:19.350 --> 09:21.894
Miss Hoover thought
I made the whole thing up.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.647
She called me a P.C. thug.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.857
I've been called
a greasy thug, too,

09:26.941 --> 09:28.568
and it never stops
hurting,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.111
so here's what
we're going to do:

09:30.194 --> 09:31.988
grease ourselves
up real good

09:32.071 --> 09:34.657
and trash that place
with a baseball bat.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.867
(sniffles)
That won't help, Dad.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.578
No one's ever gonna
believe me.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.912
But you have proof.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.038
We could go get
that confession

09:41.122 --> 09:42.290
out of Jebediah's fife.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.958
-We could?
-Come on.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.918
We can use the baseball bat
to smash open the case.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.878
-No baseball bat.
-Oh!

09:50.089 --> 09:52.008
Hi, Mr. Hurlbut.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.259
Oh, you're back.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.469
And you've brought a friend.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.305
Town Crier. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.725
One: where's the fife,
and two: give me the fife.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.809
Hey! Stop!

10:01.892 --> 10:02.977
I've got nothing
but respect

10:03.060 --> 10:04.312
for the office
of town crier

10:04.395 --> 10:06.606
but this is well outside
your jurisdiction.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.234
Oh, yeah? Well, put this
in your fife and smoke it.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.902
What the--

10:11.986 --> 10:13.779
That's Jebediah's
secret confession.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.449
It proves he was a fraud.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.202
"The secret confession

10:20.286 --> 10:22.622
"of Jebediah Springfield.
Know ye who reads..."

10:22.705 --> 10:24.999
Oh. I think, Lisa, that
you've been taken in

10:25.082 --> 10:26.626
by an obvious forgery.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.045
Unfortunately, historical
research is plagued

10:29.128 --> 10:30.463
by this sort of hoax--

10:30.546 --> 10:32.131
the so-called
confession.

10:32.214 --> 10:35.259
It's just as phony as
the Howard Hughes will,

10:35.343 --> 10:37.970
the Hitler diaries or
the Emancipation Retraction.

10:38.054 --> 10:42.642
But it explains why there's no
record of Jebediah before 1795.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.102
He was Hans Sprungfeld
until then.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.854
That's preposterous.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.564
Now, get out!

10:48.648 --> 10:51.484
You're banned from
this historical society--

10:51.567 --> 10:56.197
you and your children and
your children's children.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.032
For three months.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.666
I'm not gonna give up.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.250
I refuse to believe

11:08.334 --> 11:09.877
that everyone refuses
to believe the truth.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.760
I'd like 25 copies
on goldenrod, um,

11:17.843 --> 11:21.347
25 on canary, 25 on saffron,

11:21.430 --> 11:23.015
and 25 on paella.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.142
Okay. 100 yellow.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.686
You don't have to
help me with this, Dad.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.145
Oh, sure I do.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.231
I always believe in
helping the little guy

11:30.314 --> 11:32.400
and you're the
littlest guy I know.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.568
Question:
Is your name Ridley Scott

11:34.652 --> 11:35.695
or James Cameron?

11:35.778 --> 11:36.987
No, it's Homer.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.322
Then I would thank you

11:38.406 --> 11:40.324
to stop peering
at my screenplay, Homer.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.201
If I see a movie
where computers

11:42.284 --> 11:43.703
threaten our personal liberties,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.204
I will know
that you stole my idea.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.914
I'm just waiting for my kid.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.165
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN:</i>
<i>Mental note: steal his idea.</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:53.796
Hi, Apu.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.297
Can I put this poster
in your window?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.466
Well, of course you can,
you little pixie.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.886
Ooh! You are just as sweet as
the stix which bear your name.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.014
(gasping)
No, no, no.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.015
No, no, no, no.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.100
Take that down.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.601
As a semi-legal immigrant,

12:07.685 --> 12:09.979
your poster could land me
in a predicament

12:10.062 --> 12:12.148
as red hot as the candies
which bear that name.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.026
He wouldn't let
me put it up.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.279
Okay. Well, that's
not gonna stop us.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.990
I know a much better way
to get attention.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.075
Hear ye, hear ye!

12:23.159 --> 12:25.286
My daughter
has something to tell you

12:25.369 --> 12:26.912
about Jebediah Springfield.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.124
Aw! That little cutie
wants to do something cute.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.376
Shut up, you bums, shut up!

12:32.460 --> 12:34.920
Go ahead, angel.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.255
(clearing throat)

12:36.338 --> 12:37.923
Jebediah Springfield
was nothing more

12:38.007 --> 12:39.467
than an evil,
bloodthirsty pirate

12:39.550 --> 12:41.010
who hated this town.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.929
Good God!

12:44.013 --> 12:45.389
Homer,
you know I support

12:45.473 --> 12:48.017
uh, most any prejudice
you can name

12:48.100 --> 12:50.478
but your hero-phobia
sickens me.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.438
You and your daughter
ain't welcome here no more.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.106
Barney, show
them the exit.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.649
There's an exit?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.359
Evil bloodthirsty pirate...

12:57.443 --> 12:59.653
Hello,
Town Jubilation Committee?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.573
I got something that's going
to make you a lot less jubilant.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.661
Can't you understand,
little girl?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.413
Jebediah was no criminal.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.248
That's right.
The reason they say

13:11.332 --> 13:12.458
he had a silver tongue

13:12.541 --> 13:14.668
is because he was
such a fine speaker.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.962
That's a myth that got
mixed up with the truth.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.840
You are tampering with
forces you can't understand.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.467
We have major corporations

13:21.550 --> 13:22.635
sponsoring this event.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.719
I hope you know

13:23.803 --> 13:25.221
you're sponsoring a celebration

13:25.304 --> 13:26.388
for a murderous pirate.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.723
A pirate?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.558
Well, that's hardly
the image we want

13:29.642 --> 13:30.768
for Long John Silver's.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.480
Well, I see no way
of settling this.

13:34.563 --> 13:35.648
I say we imprison them

13:35.731 --> 13:37.733
for the duration
of our Bicentennial.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.734
There is one way.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.152
Get the silver tongue.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.654
If Jebediah's
who I say he is

13:41.737 --> 13:43.489
then it should
still be in his grave.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.907
(murmuring)

13:44.990 --> 13:48.452
I guess, but human
decency prevents--

13:48.536 --> 13:49.662
Dig him up!

13:49.745 --> 13:51.622
Dig up that corpse!

13:51.705 --> 13:54.250
If you really love
Jebediah Springfield

13:54.333 --> 13:56.335
you'll haul his bones
out of the ground

13:56.418 --> 13:58.087
to prove my daughter wrong.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.548
(chanting) Dig up his grave.
Pull out his tongue.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.341
Can't we have one meeting
that doesn't end

14:02.424 --> 14:03.592
with us digging up a corpse?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.359
Now, Lisa,
when you see

14:20.442 --> 14:22.069
there's no silver tongue
in there,

14:22.152 --> 14:24.530
will you stop trying
to ruin Jebediah's reputation?

14:24.613 --> 14:25.906
Yes.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.324
What do we win
if the tongue is there?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.576
Credibility.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.577
Ah, what a gyp.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.291
(gasping)

14:40.588 --> 14:41.797
Jebediah Springfield

14:41.881 --> 14:43.424
has been replaced
with a skeleton.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.051
No, that's the skeleton
of Jebediah.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.846
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Okay, uh...

14:48.929 --> 14:51.140
well, let's start
looking for that silver tongue.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.725
Don't forget to
look in his shoes.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.018
When I lose something

14:54.101 --> 14:55.144
sometimes it turns up
in my shoes.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.437
Actually, if it's anywhere

14:56.520 --> 14:57.980
it would be lodged
in the sinus.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.024
(chuckles)

15:00.107 --> 15:01.609
All right, here goes.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.818
Forgive us, Jebediah.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.320
We mean no disrespect.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.865
(all gasping)

15:07.948 --> 15:09.450
Well, that
settles that.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.578
There is no silver tongue,
is there, Bonesy?

15:12.661 --> 15:14.288
Oh, I wish, Chief.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.123
With that kind of dough,
I could buy me some eyeballs.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.207
(laughing)

15:17.291 --> 15:18.959
That's the spirit, Bonesy.

15:19.043 --> 15:19.960
Why don't you
sing a song

15:20.044 --> 15:21.003
for the nice people?

15:21.086 --> 15:22.004
All right.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.297
(clears throat)

15:23.380 --> 15:25.007
<i>♪ Camptown ladies</i>
<i>sing this song ♪</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:27.801
<i>♪ Doo-dah, doo-dah... ♪</i>

15:31.764 --> 15:33.140
I was so sure.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.266
Hear ye, hear ye.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.726
Everybody
makes mistakes.

15:35.809 --> 15:36.894
Let's go home.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.729
Not so fast, Simpson.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.065
This foul business
was all your fault.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.900
By the power
vested in me

15:42.983 --> 15:45.819
I hereby strip you
of your ceremonial bell...

15:45.903 --> 15:49.239
No! No!

15:49.323 --> 15:52.284
and tricorner hat.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.536
You will have the hat cleaned
and then return it.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.878
Oh...

16:02.962 --> 16:04.672
Oh, Dad, I'm
really sorry.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.924
I know how much you wanted
to be in the parade.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.717
Oh, it's not
your fault, honey.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.261
I'm supposed to be
the responsible one.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.806
I shouldn't have let you
let me get carried away.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.027
(knocking)

16:28.404 --> 16:31.240
Why did you dig up
the bones of the past?

16:31.323 --> 16:34.201
Why did you disturb
the ghosts of history?

16:34.284 --> 16:35.786
I-I-I...

16:35.869 --> 16:36.745
(grunts)

16:38.789 --> 16:41.458
General Washington?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.920
You did some good work
exposing Jebediah, Lisa.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.672
Don't stop now.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.049
There's just one piece left
in the puzzle.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.427
But I've caused so much trouble already,
General Washington,

16:51.510 --> 16:53.220
I can't go on.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.514
We had quitters
in the revolution too.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.516
We called them Kentuckians.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.435
Well, I'll just have to find

16:59.518 --> 17:01.395
another little girl
to be President.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.564
What's your friend
Janey's number?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.065
No! Not Janey!

17:05.149 --> 17:06.483
She'll pack the Supreme Court
with boys.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.778
Oh, let me help you,
George Washington.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.697
I still want to help you.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.325
"I want to help you,
George Washington"?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.494
Even your dreams
are square.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.834
Can you open my milk, Mommy?

17:23.917 --> 17:25.419
I'm not Mommy, Ralph.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.628
I'm Miss Hoover.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.838
(laughing)

17:38.348 --> 17:40.809
The missing piece of the puzzle.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.061
I've got it!

17:50.986 --> 17:53.489
You? What are you
doing here?

17:53.572 --> 17:54.990
I was right
about Jebediah

17:55.074 --> 17:56.742
and now I can prove it.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.744
Oh, please,
not that claptrap again.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.746
Haven't you hurt Jebediah enough

18:00.829 --> 18:03.540
with your childish tales
of pirate ships and fisticuffs

18:03.624 --> 18:05.834
and a silver tongue
that can't be found?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.336
That's because you stole it.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.587
That's a lie!

18:08.670 --> 18:10.672
I'm an antiquarian, damn it!

18:10.756 --> 18:13.133
It's my job
to seek out the truth.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.886
But when you found the truth,
you couldn't take it.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.139
You couldn't stand that you'd
devoted your life to a fraud

18:19.223 --> 18:20.974
so you covered it up,
didn't you?

18:21.058 --> 18:22.059
-Didn't you?
-No!

18:22.142 --> 18:23.685
No! That's
preposterous.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.145
I mean, I couldn't.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.563
You-You can't.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.606
Stop it!

18:27.689 --> 18:29.525
Where's the silver tongue?

18:43.831 --> 18:47.334
I thought no one
would ever find it.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.294
<i>When I pried open</i>
<i>the coffin, it was there.</i>

18:49.378 --> 18:52.256
<i>That shiny tongue</i>
<i>sticking out of his mouth</i>

18:52.339 --> 18:54.424
<i>razzing my entire career.</i>

18:54.508 --> 18:56.593
<i>My-My life.</i>

18:56.677 --> 19:00.222
<i>Before the dust could settle,</i>
<i>I pocketed it.</i>

19:00.305 --> 19:01.807
But I thought I had
you fooled.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.685
You did, until I realized
that Jebediah's confession

19:04.768 --> 19:07.396
was saying more
than he meant it to.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.607
How else could he
have gotten this?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.778
(gasps)

19:14.862 --> 19:16.363
<i>Sprungfeld must have</i>
<i>taken it with him</i>

19:16.446 --> 19:17.865
<i>when he ran off</i>
<i>after the fight.</i>

19:20.117 --> 19:21.493
Exactly.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.453
This celebration is a sham.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.497
And it's all my fault.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.082
We've got to get the word out

19:27.166 --> 19:29.209
to every man, woman
and child in town.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.669
<i>♪♪ (march)</i>

19:42.973 --> 19:44.391

Stop the parade!

19:48.437 --> 19:49.479
What?

19:49.563 --> 19:51.148
What's going on here?

19:51.231 --> 19:52.900
This is highly unorthodox.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.027
This is Lisa Simpson.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.654
She's discovered something
very important

19:57.738 --> 20:00.949
about Jebediah Springfield
that you need to hear.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.910
(microphone feedback)

20:02.993 --> 20:03.994
(clears throat)

20:04.077 --> 20:05.829
People of Springfield,

20:05.913 --> 20:07.206
I, um...

20:07.289 --> 20:09.291
I don't know
quite how to say this.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.792
Don't be shy,
little girl.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.754
Think of Jebediah
and the words will come.

20:13.837 --> 20:17.174
I did a lot of research
on Jebediah Springfield and--

20:17.257 --> 20:18.884
I think I can pick her off.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.761
Wait. Let's see what
she has to say.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.308
Jebediah Springfield was...

20:28.268 --> 20:29.186
Jebediah was...
