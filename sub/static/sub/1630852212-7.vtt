WEBVTT

00:15.099 --> 00:19.179
You're going to be
the Chocolate Princess.

00:20.039 --> 00:21.089
Esther...

00:22.030 --> 00:25.170
What did you do to your sister?
In the bathtub, right away.

00:26.019 --> 00:28.109
Rub her properly
with the sponge.

00:28.129 --> 00:31.019
Stay here with her,
you must watch her.

00:31.039 --> 00:32.109
I'll be right there.

00:35.210 --> 00:37.100
Let's see...

00:38.229 --> 00:42.210
I have to look after you
because I'm your big sister.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.189
Hi.

01:08.170 --> 01:11.129
Don't you want dinner?
I've got some salad left over.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.019
Are you all right?

01:14.129 --> 01:16.019
I'm perfectly fine.

01:37.090 --> 01:43.020
MARIA:
Can I sleep with you tonight?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.140
GUSTAVO:
Of course!!!

01:45.159 --> 01:47.170
You have your PJs here :))

01:55.000 --> 01:59.069
PERFECT LIFE

01:59.090 --> 02:05.200
WHEN EVERYTHING COLLAPSES

02:09.189 --> 02:11.189
SEVENTH MONTH

02:25.060 --> 02:26.090
Morning.

02:28.079 --> 02:29.110
Morning.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.090
You smell great.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.180
Did you sleep all right?

02:39.030 --> 02:40.120
Fantastic.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.150
Really fantastic.

02:44.129 --> 02:48.180
You don't appreciate a bed till
you've been
on a couch seven months.

02:52.079 --> 02:53.110
What?

02:56.199 --> 02:57.210
Look...

02:58.099 --> 03:01.099
I know that we said
we'd take it slowly but...

03:03.009 --> 03:05.000
you sleep here almost every
night.

03:06.189 --> 03:08.150
And Juanito will be here soon.

03:10.069 --> 03:12.150
-That won't be his name.
-Okay, all right.

03:12.169 --> 03:13.210
The baby, then.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.090
I don't know.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.159
Think about it.

03:18.009 --> 03:21.129
We could turn my office
into his room.

03:26.009 --> 03:28.210
-Pablo, are you dressing Paula?
-Yes.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.079
Hurry, please, I have an early
meeting.

03:31.099 --> 03:32.079
Coming, coming.

03:36.060 --> 03:38.180
If I don't drink water in five
minutes,
I'll die.

03:38.199 --> 03:40.180
What are you doing half-dressed?

03:40.199 --> 03:43.120
Pablo, Paula is running around
in knickers.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.199
No, sweetheart, no.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.150
Pablo, come and watch over
Martina.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.159
I'll need ten minutes.
Come on, let's get changed.

03:52.039 --> 03:53.210
Be right back, sweetie. Hurry!

03:53.229 --> 03:56.069
I'm running late, Leire.

03:59.079 --> 04:03.110
Come on, finish it off.
Otherwise Mummy
will kill me and with good
reason.

04:03.129 --> 04:05.009
-No more.
-No more?

04:05.030 --> 04:06.229
Okay, doesn't matter. Whatever.

04:33.069 --> 04:35.019
-Mum.
-María...

04:35.040 --> 04:37.019
-Do you know where your sister
is?
-No.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.199
We've called her to wish her
happy birthday and she isn't
picking up.

04:40.220 --> 04:42.120
She must be working.

04:42.139 --> 04:44.139
Did you wish her happy birthday?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.090
It's 10.15am, Mum.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.029
-She's been acting weird.
-Because she is weird.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.079
Don't say that.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.180
-You're living at her place.
-I'm saying it with love.

04:54.199 --> 04:57.139
-Tell her to throw a party.
-She hears you loud and clear.

04:58.019 --> 05:01.089
-It's on speaker mode.
-Throw her a party or something.

05:01.110 --> 05:03.170
I can't throw a party,
I'm super busy.

05:03.189 --> 05:06.149
Send us the latest ultrasound
image
of Juanito.

05:06.170 --> 05:09.050
That won't be his name.
You're all obsessed.

05:09.069 --> 05:11.149
I'm super busy now, really.
Love you.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.040
Ciao.

05:19.149 --> 05:22.149
INCOMING CALL
MARÍA

05:29.009 --> 05:30.149
Shall we go to Cádiz in the van?

05:32.230 --> 05:34.100
What are you on about? Now?

05:34.120 --> 05:36.029
Yeah, come on, let's go.

05:36.159 --> 05:38.069
No way, I have exams in ten
days.

05:38.090 --> 05:41.159
Exactly, so you can relax.
It'll be bloody great for you.

05:42.069 --> 05:44.199
-No.
-I bet you know it all off by
heart.

05:45.129 --> 05:49.029
You always get great marks.
You're a swot. Okay, listen up.

05:49.050 --> 05:51.129
-"Mechanisms and materials."
-Cut it out.

05:51.149 --> 05:52.189
-Go on, answer it.
-No, dude.

05:52.209 --> 05:55.000
-Answer me.
-I'm not going anywhere,

05:55.019 --> 05:57.029
I have to study.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.199
Come on. We'll grab some
mushrooms
and go to the seaside?

06:02.009 --> 06:02.230
I'm stressed...

06:04.170 --> 06:06.189
Are you thirteen years old or
what?

06:06.209 --> 06:08.230
Actually no, I'm not thirteen.

06:09.009 --> 06:11.189
I'm 40, and today is my damn
birthday.

06:12.199 --> 06:14.160
I've got the bloody day off.

06:14.180 --> 06:17.089
Don't you fancy spending it with
me?
Don't you?

06:17.110 --> 06:20.120
Here, keep your shitty
mechanics!

06:23.189 --> 06:26.009
You're gonna fail it, you know.

06:32.129 --> 06:35.209
I don't know why you're in such
a rush
to get back with Gustavo.

06:35.230 --> 06:38.199
You haven't had any time
to enjoy being single. None.

06:38.220 --> 06:41.009
You overrate being single.

06:41.029 --> 06:43.139
-And you overrate marriage.
-Yes.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.000
What's happening with Xosé?

06:46.019 --> 06:48.000
What do you mean? Nothing.

06:48.019 --> 06:51.000
Come off it, María,
you really fell for the guy.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.209
Okay, I fell for him, past
tense.
End of story.

06:53.230 --> 06:56.019
And you'll never see him again?

06:58.029 --> 07:00.220
You can live with Gustavo
and see Xosé whenever.

07:01.000 --> 07:01.180
It's okay.

07:01.199 --> 07:04.009
We don't all need lovers.

07:04.029 --> 07:07.019
I think it's fine if you have
them.
But it's not me.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.189
I'm not saying you need it.

07:08.209 --> 07:11.040
I'm saying that
if you fancy seeing Xosé,

07:11.060 --> 07:14.029
I don't understand why
you can't see him.

07:14.050 --> 07:16.149
And here's a newsflash
about lovers:

07:16.170 --> 07:18.230
they're a bloody amazing
dopamine fix.

07:19.009 --> 07:22.120
It's brilliant for stress.
Brilliant.

07:22.230 --> 07:25.100
Why not go and live by yourself?

07:25.120 --> 07:27.180
You can figure it out from
there.
Calmly.

07:27.199 --> 07:32.180
Because I don't want to live by
myself.
The baby is nearly due...

07:34.029 --> 07:36.149
You know? I want a normal
family.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.000
Normal?

07:39.019 --> 07:41.209
I want a normal family, go to
the beach
with them on Sundays.

07:42.069 --> 07:46.009
You take the car, go to the
beach,
look for a place, set up the
parasol.

07:46.029 --> 07:50.029
You take out a Tupperware,
then all eat water melon from
it.

07:50.050 --> 07:53.180
You missed out the bit about
not finding a bloody place to
park,

07:53.199 --> 07:57.220
the beach is chock-a-block, the
kids
can't swim, the sun is
scorching.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.009
And when you get the Tupperware
out...
it's warm.

08:01.029 --> 08:04.009
The bloody watermelon Tupperware
is always warm.

08:04.029 --> 08:05.139
That's what I want.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.149
My warm watermelon
in a Tupperware.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.230
You can do that with Gari.

08:16.050 --> 08:18.199
By the way,
did you tell him about Gus?

08:18.220 --> 08:19.189
No.

08:20.089 --> 08:22.139
I'm afraid he'll take it badly.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.180
Right.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.000
How are things?

08:25.019 --> 08:26.040
I'm good.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.050
Yeah.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.089
How's it going with Pablo?

08:29.110 --> 08:31.040
Same old, same old.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.129
Cris...

08:34.149 --> 08:35.230
I'm good.

08:36.110 --> 08:38.029
I have to go or I'll be late.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.059
Give me a hug. Come here.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.220
Love you.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.220
Love you too.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.139
Love you, Juanito, sweetie.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.090
His name isn't Juanito.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.210
-Wish me luck with the hearing.
-Good luck.

08:48.230 --> 08:50.179
-Call you later.
-Okay.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.009
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:02.029 --> 09:03.159
Can we talk for a minute?

09:03.179 --> 09:06.029
-Yeah. Sure, come in.
-Yeah?

09:06.049 --> 09:08.039
But first, I'll show you
something.

09:08.059 --> 09:10.139
-Yeah?
-Wait and see, you'll really
like it.

09:10.159 --> 09:12.080
-Ready?
-Yeah.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.120
-Sure?
-Sure.

09:13.139 --> 09:16.000
Okay then, one, two, three...
There!

09:16.019 --> 09:18.169
Ta-daa!

09:18.190 --> 09:20.210
Juanito's room! What do you say?

09:21.120 --> 09:22.210
-What...? Good.
-Yeah?

09:22.230 --> 09:23.210
-Great.
-Like it?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.009
I love it.

09:25.029 --> 09:26.220
There are still things missing.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.190
They all helped me.
It was a team effort, right?

09:29.210 --> 09:32.110
You all put a lot of work into
it.

09:32.129 --> 09:34.149
Hey, your belly has got a lot
bigger.

09:34.169 --> 09:36.139
She's seven months gone. Right?

09:36.159 --> 09:39.220
-Honestly?
-Yes, I haven't seen you for a
while.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.080
And so what did you want to talk
about?

09:44.220 --> 09:46.070
Well...

09:47.009 --> 09:49.039
-Maybe I'll come back another
time...
-No, no.

09:49.059 --> 09:51.070
-You're all here...
-No, we'll go.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.019
-Let's get a drink.
-Sure?

09:53.039 --> 09:56.129
-You want privacy, huh?
-Oh, they wanna discuss stuff...

09:56.149 --> 09:59.100
There are refreshments in the
fridge.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
Okay.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.029
So, what's up?

10:09.220 --> 10:12.090
I came to tell you something
about my life,

10:12.110 --> 10:14.059
which affects you in a way.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.019
Well, not you, it affects
Juanito.

10:16.039 --> 10:18.200
I know that won't be his name,
but it just came out.

10:18.220 --> 10:20.100
What do you want to tell me?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.139
I'm back with Gustavo.

10:22.159 --> 10:26.179
Oh! The guy who left and dumped
you?

10:27.059 --> 10:29.080
Yeah, he left, but he's back.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.000
And, the thing is...

10:31.200 --> 10:33.009
I think that...

10:33.029 --> 10:35.019
you need to know...

10:35.039 --> 10:36.159
we plan to live together.

10:36.179 --> 10:40.019
Well, we're thinking of living
together.

10:40.039 --> 10:43.100
-Well, that's normal, isn't it?
-Yeah, I guess.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.009
That's the normal thing.

10:45.029 --> 10:49.009
And when the baby is born,
he'll live with Gus as well.

10:49.029 --> 10:50.220
It's important you meet him,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.090
because he'll spend a lot of
time
with him and you're his dad.

10:54.110 --> 10:56.220
I think it's weird
you don't know each other.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.100
We're going to look
at prams this afternoon.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.129
Remember we're going to look
at prams?

11:02.019 --> 11:04.070
-Remember?
-Yeah, yeah, prams.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.120
So it's perfect.
You both come along

11:06.139 --> 11:08.179
-and can meet each other.
-Okay.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.220
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.039
-Do you think that's okay?
-Yeah.

11:25.090 --> 11:26.110
Hello.

11:27.149 --> 11:29.120
May I have a gown, please?

11:30.009 --> 11:31.090
A clean one, okay?

11:31.110 --> 11:34.000
Excuse me, we wash them every
week.

11:39.019 --> 11:45.009
Do you wish to talk with
REPENTANTMARRIEDGUY?

11:57.149 --> 12:01.049
KITTYONHEAT84:
Hi, RepentantMarriedGuy

12:06.100 --> 12:09.129
REPENTANTMARRIEDGUY:
Fancy playing, Kitty?

12:14.220 --> 12:18.009
KITTYONHEAT84:
And what do you want to play?

12:20.220 --> 12:24.000
REPENTANTMARRIEDGUY:
You a repentant married woman
too?

12:27.149 --> 12:30.070
KITTYONHEAT84:
Do you like married women?

12:39.129 --> 12:43.070
REPENTANTMARRIEDGUY:
No, looks like your husband
doesn't give you what you need.

12:47.019 --> 12:50.039
KITTYONHEAT84:
Quit talking about my husband,
okay?

12:59.049 --> 13:03.000
REPENTANTMARRIEDGUY:
If you want, we can talk
about your two daughters.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.129
Who the hell are you?

13:17.029 --> 13:19.090
I'm your boring husband.

13:45.039 --> 13:46.059
-Hello.
-Hi.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.090
You meet at last.

13:47.110 --> 13:49.120
Gari, Gustavo.
Gustavo, Gari.

13:49.139 --> 13:52.059
-Hello.
-Pleased to meet you.

13:53.059 --> 13:55.149
-María told me a lot about you.
-Yeah.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.009
Shall we choose a pram
and grab some dinner?

13:59.029 --> 14:01.169
I'd rather eat alone at home.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.039
That's fine.
We'll have dinner some other
time.

14:06.059 --> 14:07.159
-Yeah.
-Sure.

14:08.110 --> 14:11.070
Bet there are people
who've studied engineering

14:11.090 --> 14:14.070
and spend their entire lives
perfecting these prams.

14:14.090 --> 14:15.220
Look, this is for coffee.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.169
-Can I help you?
-Yes, please.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.149
-We're looking for a pram.
-Sure.

14:19.169 --> 14:22.049
And I need to pee.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.129
-Back there on the right.
-Just a sec.

14:24.149 --> 14:26.059
Thanks. I'll be right back.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.169
-All right.
-Thanks.

14:29.090 --> 14:31.080
Not long to go, huh?
Nervous?

14:31.100 --> 14:33.230
I have a four-year-old,
a month before he was born

14:34.009 --> 14:35.190
I was more hysterical than my
wife.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.039
Is it a boy or a girl?

14:37.059 --> 14:38.070
Boy.

14:38.169 --> 14:41.070
-Yes, you see, I'm not the
father.
-No...

14:41.149 --> 14:42.139
I'm the father.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.049
Ah, great.

14:45.070 --> 14:48.039
As for prams,
this one is definitely the best.

14:48.059 --> 14:50.019
-Right.
-Great value for money.

14:50.039 --> 14:52.120
Very good material, comfortable,
stable...

14:52.139 --> 14:54.110
Folds up like a dream.

14:54.129 --> 14:55.200
Do you have a car?

14:57.019 --> 14:58.070
No.

14:58.230 --> 15:02.120
I don't have a driving license
yet.

15:02.190 --> 15:04.000
Oh, all right.

15:04.019 --> 15:06.210
I got mine when my kid was born.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.230
Happy birthday, Esther.

15:12.009 --> 15:14.149
I've called you a few times,
can't track you down.

15:14.169 --> 15:17.179
See you later.
I'll pop by your place, okay?

15:17.200 --> 15:20.039
Love you lots, sis.

15:20.059 --> 15:21.070
Ciao.

15:34.009 --> 15:35.129
Yes, it has everything.

15:35.149 --> 15:36.230
Careful.

15:37.009 --> 15:38.110
Yes, but careful, okay?

15:38.129 --> 15:39.220
It's the latest model.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.100
You can take out the seat
and add the carrycot.
Marvellous.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.230
This is real leather. Feel it.

15:46.009 --> 15:47.179
And this has safety features...?

15:47.200 --> 15:50.059
Of course, absolutely...
Safety harness...

16:21.029 --> 16:22.120
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:31.159 --> 16:33.039
Wow, it's been ages.

16:33.230 --> 16:35.110
How's it going?

16:35.129 --> 16:36.179
Great.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.230
And how about you?

16:38.120 --> 16:40.000
Great, terrific.

16:40.019 --> 16:44.019
Actually, today is my birthday.
I'm throwing a tropical party.

16:44.039 --> 16:45.059
It's my 40th.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.090
-Forty.
-I know.

16:49.149 --> 16:54.110
I wanted to call you, honestly,
but I didn't know if you wanted
or...

16:54.220 --> 16:56.159
There's no normal tofu.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.090
-It's okay. That one is fine.
-Yeah?

16:59.110 --> 17:01.110
Let me introduce you to Ruth.

17:01.129 --> 17:03.000
-Ruth, Esther.
-Hi there.

17:03.019 --> 17:04.210
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

17:04.230 --> 17:08.009
And these two little ones
are Olivia and Cristina.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.009
Gosh...

17:11.029 --> 17:13.079
-Non-identical twins?
-That's right.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.230
How's your painting going?

17:15.009 --> 17:17.150
Remember I told you
that Esther is a painter?

17:17.170 --> 17:20.059
-Well, she's an artist.
-Great. I love art.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.160
Yeah, everything is terrific.

17:22.180 --> 17:25.140
-I'm going to exhibit at the
MACBA.
-Wow!

17:25.160 --> 17:27.230
-Get out of here!
-I can hardly believe it.

17:28.009 --> 17:29.180
-Congrats.
-It's like a dream.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.180
I've just started a new series

17:31.200 --> 17:34.099
about nooks and crannies,
obscure places.

17:34.119 --> 17:37.119
I'm working on the bidet
and toilet brush right now.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.089
-Okay.
-DJ Meneo will be coming.

17:39.109 --> 17:42.170
-So if you fancy stopping by.
-Send us invites, okay?

17:42.190 --> 17:44.099
-Please.
-We'd love to see it.

17:44.119 --> 17:46.200
We have to go.
I'm so glad to have seen you.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.160
Bye. It was a pleasure.
Say goodbye!

17:49.180 --> 17:51.099
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.220
MARIA

18:37.069 --> 18:39.190
It's me, Cris.
You're not picking up.

18:39.210 --> 18:42.039
I've left messages.
Have a great birthday.

18:42.059 --> 18:45.109
Lots of love, speak later.
Kisses, call me.

18:46.049 --> 18:47.200
Happy birthday!

18:47.220 --> 18:50.190
I wanted to say it in person,
but there's no sign of you...

18:50.210 --> 18:51.220
Are you all right?

18:52.000 --> 18:56.009
They're going a big mad at work.
I've covered for you, but...

18:56.029 --> 18:59.119
We love you so much, sweetheart.
We're very proud of you.

18:59.140 --> 19:02.000
It's lovely what you're doing
for your sister.

19:02.019 --> 19:03.049
Say something to her.

19:03.069 --> 19:06.009
Happy birthday,
I love you to bits.

19:06.029 --> 19:07.210
The sky's the limit for you.

19:07.230 --> 19:11.069
Because you're an extraordinary
person who...

19:11.140 --> 19:12.119
Hi, Esther.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.170
You should have said
it's your birthday.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.049
I don't know, never mind.

19:16.069 --> 19:18.150
We're at different stages
in our lives...

19:18.220 --> 19:21.119
and I guess the best thing is
if we split up.

19:21.140 --> 19:24.009
I hope it all really works out
for you.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.130
Honestly, I want you to be
happy, okay?

19:26.150 --> 19:28.230
Lots of love.
Oh, and happy birthday.

20:19.119 --> 20:22.059
You lied to my fucking face!

20:22.200 --> 20:27.009
That's why you don't want more
kids?
So you can screw around like a
whore.

20:29.150 --> 20:31.130
How many have you slept with?

20:32.089 --> 20:34.099
-Fifteen, twenty, two hundred?
-The girls!

20:34.119 --> 20:36.089
Now you're worried about them?

20:36.109 --> 20:39.170
So go and tell them a story
about their mother on heat 84.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.029
That's the problem.

20:42.049 --> 20:43.190
I'm your daughters' mum.

20:43.210 --> 20:46.049
That's what I've become:
their mum.

20:46.200 --> 20:51.000
You don't see me as a woman
anymore,
something's wrong with us.

20:53.130 --> 20:54.210
Pablo...

20:55.069 --> 20:56.160
Look at me.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.029
Tell me you've never slept
with anyone.

21:01.150 --> 21:04.089
On a shoot, a trip...
When I'm at home with the
kids...

21:04.109 --> 21:05.140
Never?

21:10.029 --> 21:11.039
No.

21:13.069 --> 21:14.119
Dude!

21:27.079 --> 21:29.160
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry I lied to you.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.029
I'm sorry.

21:32.039 --> 21:34.109
We've been in crisis for three
years.

21:34.130 --> 21:37.200
Three years almost without
looking
at one other, without touching
each other.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.029
And you've only reacted

21:39.049 --> 21:42.079
because I slept with five guys
I'll never see again.

21:42.099 --> 21:44.019
So, it was five?

21:59.210 --> 22:01.170
Where the hell are you going
now?

22:09.140 --> 22:11.079
It wasn't that bad in the end.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.009
-It went well, didn't it?
-Yeah, great.

22:14.029 --> 22:15.150
It was weird to start with...

22:15.170 --> 22:17.220
-But then we got over it.
-Yeah.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.099
-There was chemistry.
-Yeah, it was good.

22:20.119 --> 22:21.230
-Gari is really nice.
-Yeah.

22:22.089 --> 22:24.109
He'll be a wonderful dad.

22:24.130 --> 22:26.059
And you'll be a wonderful mum.

22:28.150 --> 22:30.220
And you'll be a wonderful
stepfather.

22:39.089 --> 22:41.009
-See you tomorrow?
-Yeah.

22:50.079 --> 22:51.130
Hey...

22:52.140 --> 22:54.200
And if we carry on where we left
off?

22:56.150 --> 22:58.029
At a notary's?

22:58.150 --> 22:59.220
No.

23:00.109 --> 23:01.230
Making wedding plans.

23:06.059 --> 23:08.099
Are you asking to marry me?

23:09.130 --> 23:10.190
I think so.

23:13.029 --> 23:14.150
All right.

23:15.109 --> 23:17.039
I do.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.049
Yeah?

23:20.119 --> 23:21.170
I do, too.

23:22.059 --> 23:24.170
-That's why I asked you.
-Sure.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.059
-It's a deal.
-It's a deal.

23:31.079 --> 23:33.079
-Love you
-Love you, too.

24:08.089 --> 24:10.009
God...

24:18.099 --> 24:21.180
I wanted to order something to
eat,
please.

24:23.099 --> 24:25.039
What sort of pasta do you have?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.039
Oh, great. No, that's perfect.

24:42.119 --> 24:44.200
...the first part
and quite confidently.

24:44.220 --> 24:48.180
Brian Roberts, passes without
looking.
Steals it from Brizuela.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.109
Shermadini on the floor.

24:50.130 --> 24:52.190
Movistar Estudiantes run with
it.
Caner Medley...

24:52.210 --> 24:55.089
-Foul?
-Bad sportsmanship.

25:59.180 --> 26:01.019
Happy...

26:15.190 --> 26:16.200
What's wrong?

26:18.109 --> 26:20.079
Welcome to my party.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.029
I bumped into Núria.

26:29.069 --> 26:33.160
She was with her new girlfriend,
she's had two gorgeous baby
girls.

26:35.029 --> 26:36.059
Gosh.

26:37.049 --> 26:38.079
I'm sorry.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.029
She couldn't just have one,
of course not.

26:41.049 --> 26:42.220
She had two.

26:43.130 --> 26:44.230
That's her decision.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.180
You're covered in paint.

26:53.099 --> 26:54.200
Shall I give you a bath?

26:54.220 --> 26:58.180
I'll give you a bath, okay?
And then we can have dinner
together.

26:59.039 --> 27:00.049
Fancy that?

27:00.069 --> 27:04.039
People have kids, María. And a
family.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.180
And I've got presbionics.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.029
-You've got what?
-Presbionics.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.039
Presbyopia?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.170
I can't see things close up.

27:15.190 --> 27:17.039
Well...

27:17.059 --> 27:18.190
You wear glasses.

27:19.089 --> 27:24.029
But the pharmacy ones are ugly
and they make your eyes look
big.

27:25.009 --> 27:27.019
And my face is weird anyway...

27:27.039 --> 27:30.049
No it isn't.
You have a lovely face.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.220
And besides, it's your birthday.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.009
Look, I've brought you
something.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.099
-You bought me a Swiss roll?
-Yeah.

27:42.059 --> 27:44.109
-Were there no Pink Panthers?
-No.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.039
Do you like it?

27:47.049 --> 27:48.170
Go on, blow it out. Make a wish.

27:50.099 --> 27:51.220
Make a wish.
