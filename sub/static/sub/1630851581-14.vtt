01:03.146 --> 01:04.898
Hey, Mike, do you want to play?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.067
No, thanks. Not today.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.748
‐ Glowboo?
‐ Greetings, Mike.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.250
How is your project going?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.876
I've been working on it all week

01:24.960 --> 01:27.212
and I think I cracked it.
This oughta unlock

01:27.212 --> 01:28.505
loads of your features.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.507
I knew you'd succeed
with your smart

01:30.507 --> 01:32.009
yet spongy human brain.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.386
However,
should we not alert Ms Jones

01:34.386 --> 01:36.680
‐ before upgrading me?
‐ But then it wouldn't be

01:36.763 --> 01:38.724
a surprise!
Just imagine her face

01:38.807 --> 01:40.726
when she sees you, I don't know,

01:40.726 --> 01:44.187
boocap a ghost in 30 seconds
and do a victory breakdance

01:44.271 --> 01:45.689
thanks to my handiwork.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.774
I do not know
what breakdance is,

01:47.774 --> 01:49.443
but I trust you, my friend.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.123
Now, go, go, go!
Move it or lose it!

02:03.123 --> 02:06.752
‐ How dare you?
‐ Sorry. Not you, lady.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.092
In the name of the law,
stop your car!

02:14.092 --> 02:15.010
Aaah!

02:24.227 --> 02:26.104
(Evil laugh)

02:28.023 --> 02:29.858
G‐g‐g‐ghost!

02:29.983 --> 02:31.902
(Yawning)

02:41.787 --> 02:43.246
Done.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.292
So? Feeling new and improved?

02:48.251 --> 02:49.378
Greetings, Spike.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.716
‐ Er, it's Mike!
‐ OK, upzorging my data‐blurg.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.887
Aw, man! My upgrade
must have boggled your circuits!

02:59.388 --> 03:02.307
Up and at 'em, Mike! We got
a brand‐new ghost in town.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.477
Uh, sure. Yeah. Be right there!

03:10.148 --> 03:12.192
I've got no record
of our spectre,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.945
but it's on the corner
of 5th and Madison.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.699
‐ You'd better take Glowboo!
‐ Or maybe he deserves a break?

03:18.782 --> 03:21.076
The three of us can handle this.
Right, guys?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.079
Glowboo's an indispensable
part of the team.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.705
He's going with you!

03:25.872 --> 03:27.916
BOTH: Let's go, Ghost Force!

03:28.500 --> 03:31.294
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

03:36.758 --> 03:37.968
Fury!

03:38.969 --> 03:40.262
Krush!

03:41.638 --> 03:42.931
Myst!

03:46.518 --> 03:47.853
Ghost Force!

03:52.149 --> 03:55.235
Er, since when did you learn
the backstroke, Glowboo?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.070
Anything to assist
the Gross Force.

03:58.071 --> 04:02.117
Ah! Ha, ha! Gross Force!
Nice one, Glowboo.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.995
Such a sophisticated
sense of humour.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.705
Look! Boo‐bogey below!

04:09.541 --> 04:11.710
Aaah!

04:17.048 --> 04:18.008
Quick, Boocap!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.557
Imminent danger detected.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.727
What?

04:32.814 --> 04:36.234
‐ Uh... What just happened?
‐ Not cool, Glowboo!

04:38.028 --> 04:41.448
Boocap hazard neutralised.
You are now safe, Smush.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.533
‐ (Makes weird noise)
‐ Smush?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.161
Is it just me or does Glowboo
have a major... ?

04:50.081 --> 04:52.417
Boo!

04:58.381 --> 05:00.967
‐ (Hoots)
‐ Woah!

05:03.804 --> 05:06.348
(Screaming)

05:09.476 --> 05:10.769
(Yawning)

05:10.894 --> 05:12.604
(Snoring)

05:16.775 --> 05:19.653
Roosters wake people up,
but this bird makes 'em sleep,

05:19.736 --> 05:22.155
so let's call it Snorebird?

05:22.280 --> 05:23.698
No, that's dumb.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.827
Got it. Somniboo! Way smarter!

05:27.452 --> 05:29.329
‐ Whoa!
‐ Whoa!

05:34.459 --> 05:37.003
Genius. The powder
comes from its rear plumage.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.297
So, let's shake
its tail feathers!

05:39.464 --> 05:42.801
Ob‐j‐ect‐ive
b‐b‐block bird butt!

05:45.428 --> 05:48.139
‐ Nice butterfly.
‐ Uh, thanks, Glowboo.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.642
But we're gonna need
more firepower.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.936
Fractal power!

05:53.812 --> 05:55.355
(Hoots) Boo!

05:55.522 --> 05:57.524
Uh... Looks like it made it
more angry

05:57.524 --> 05:58.692
than anything else!

06:08.201 --> 06:11.413
Our feathered friend
is still fighting back!

06:14.583 --> 06:16.167
So, what's our plan now? Huh?

06:17.669 --> 06:20.005
(Hoots)

06:20.714 --> 06:22.007
Huh?

06:27.512 --> 06:30.056
Under the feathers!
That's its power supply!

06:30.056 --> 06:32.017
Then that's our target!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.898
Huh?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.575
(Hoots happily)

06:50.076 --> 06:52.245
(Groan)

06:52.245 --> 06:54.664
Glowboo's out of whack.
I'm calling Ms Jones.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.125
What? He's acing this!

06:57.250 --> 06:59.377
Thanks to him
we know the ghost's weak spot.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.464
New objective.
Catch b‐b‐butterfly.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.381
(Squawks)

07:04.466 --> 07:06.968
(Frantic squawking)

07:06.968 --> 07:09.387
‐ You were saying?
‐ Kids, we got a problem!

07:09.554 --> 07:11.264
I'm afraid
Glowboo's been hacked!

07:11.431 --> 07:14.267
Oh, great!
We need his Boo‐Firefly

07:14.267 --> 07:16.061
to distract and defeat
this ghost!

07:16.227 --> 07:18.271
Well, what if we...

07:18.271 --> 07:20.148
Ooh! Hack the hacker!

07:20.148 --> 07:22.942
I'll get cracking, er, hacking!

07:25.111 --> 07:27.280
‐ (Gasps)
‐ Aaah!

07:27.405 --> 07:29.532
What do we do about
our butterfly chaser?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.451
He's becoming
a real loose cannon.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.911
I'll handle Glowboo.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.329
I know him
like the back

07:34.329 --> 07:35.288
of his circuit board.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.209
If you say so!
Good luck, Krush. Boo ya later!

07:42.253 --> 07:43.463
Phew!

07:50.053 --> 07:51.262
(Squawking)

07:51.721 --> 07:53.890
Huh? Aaah!

07:56.393 --> 07:57.602
Aaah!

07:57.977 --> 07:59.646
Glowboo! No!

08:03.441 --> 08:04.859
Huh? Whoa!

08:04.859 --> 08:06.903
Sorry to Fractal Boo you,
Glowboo,

08:06.903 --> 08:08.988
but you're becoming
way too dangerous.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.325
Hostile presence detected.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.662
Easy now, Glowboo.
It's me, Krush!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.497
Neutralizing Slush...

08:17.664 --> 08:18.832
Glowboo!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.504
(Hoots)

08:26.423 --> 08:28.174
‐ Thank you!
‐ (Hoots)

08:28.508 --> 08:29.467
Aaah!

08:33.471 --> 08:35.849
Aaah!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.479
Krush, over here!

08:48.862 --> 08:50.488
That was close!

08:56.995 --> 08:58.747
Ms Jones, things are heating up!

08:58.747 --> 09:01.291
Glowboo's our only hope.
If you can't fix him,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.585
it'll be nap time
in New York forever!

09:03.585 --> 09:09.090
Oh! I can't crack the malware.
it's password‐protected!

09:09.174 --> 09:11.509
27‐G‐01‐F!

09:11.885 --> 09:14.679
‐ What?
‐ Krush!

09:14.679 --> 09:18.224
27‐G‐01‐F. That's the password.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.729
I'm in! I can access the code!
Starting reboot now.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.777
‐ Rebooting.
‐ Well done, Krush!

09:28.902 --> 09:31.196
But how on Earth
did you know the password?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.697
Uh...

09:32.864 --> 09:35.241
Somniboo's going after Glowboo!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.291
Aaah!

09:44.167 --> 09:45.710
BOTH: Krush!

09:45.835 --> 09:47.253
(Groans)

09:48.213 --> 09:49.172
Oh, no!

09:54.052 --> 09:55.845
I'll put you to bed for that!

10:00.683 --> 10:01.768
Reset complete.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.603
Greetings, I am Glowboo.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.397
Time to give this ghost
a wake‐up call.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.191
Yeah!

10:15.115 --> 10:16.699
Now! Glowboo!

10:27.877 --> 10:29.712
Boo‐cap it, sis!

10:31.214 --> 10:32.590
Time to go to sleep!

10:34.884 --> 10:35.760
Octocat!

11:08.042 --> 11:09.043
Huh?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.634
Hello, my friend.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.970
Glowboo!

11:19.053 --> 11:20.305
Boo‐yah!

11:26.352 --> 11:29.355
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you
I wanted to upgrade Glowboo.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.982
I wanted to impress you,

11:30.982 --> 11:33.484
but instead
I messed up big time.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.612
Apology accepted, Mike.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.865
And I've gotta admit,
I am impressed.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.534
Your work
had a touch of brilliance.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.870
Whaddaya say
we both take a crack at it?

11:43.995 --> 11:48.208
Maybe together we could unlock
Glowboo's hidden features.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.169
‐ Hmm?
‐ I'd... uh...

11:51.169 --> 11:54.339
‐ Yes!
‐ If I can put in a request

11:54.464 --> 11:56.007
for a future update,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.259
I'd like to have
a special breakdance feature.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.511
Good one, Glowboo.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.056
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humour.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.058
Uh...
Didn't understand that one.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.685
Maybe you should update
his comedy features?

12:07.685 --> 12:10.521
(Laughter) Duly noted!

12:29.666 --> 12:33.086
(Frantic squawking)

12:36.798 --> 12:39.384
I don't understand
why you took that with you.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.386
This is my lucky charm!
And I could use

12:41.511 --> 12:43.221
all the luck I can get, Andy.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.348
Yeah, well,
I'm not superstitious, Liv.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.727
It's Charlie's Ghost Force Quiz.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.231
I don't need luck to win,
since we are the Ghost Force.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.277
Go away!

13:06.577 --> 13:08.997
Still don't believe in luck?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.164
(Groans)

13:16.004 --> 13:19.590
Here come the Bakers.
Now let the game begin!

13:20.216 --> 13:23.594
Welcome to my latest,
greatest Ghost Force quiz!

13:23.594 --> 13:27.265
We are live on my Ghostblog!
Everyone cool with that?

13:27.265 --> 13:29.767
‐ Yeah!
‐ Mmm‐hmm.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.685
(Dreamily) Yeah...

13:32.937 --> 13:36.149
‐ Mike?
‐ Right... Let's start!

13:36.232 --> 13:39.944
Excellent! You know the rules.
Buzz before you answer.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.739
All right, Ghost fans,
here we go!

13:43.281 --> 13:45.158
What's Liv got in her hand?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.661
‐ Some so‐called lucky charm.
‐ Won't do her any good,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.914
'cause I know my Ghost Force
trivia as if I was one of 'em.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.710
First question.
What is Myst's primary weapon?

13:56.461 --> 13:58.129
‐ Spectral Bow!
‐ Correct!

13:58.254 --> 14:02.508
One point for Liv's team.
Question two. What kind of power

14:02.508 --> 14:04.719
does the awesome and amazing
Krush have?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.888
‐ Ha!
‐ (Honking)

14:06.888 --> 14:08.973
‐ Fractal power!
‐ Yeah!

14:09.140 --> 14:10.308
(Honking) Burghorror!

14:12.477 --> 14:15.146
(Repeated honking)

14:15.146 --> 14:16.814
Blowing up fireworks!

14:17.690 --> 14:19.442
‐ Unbelievable, Liv!
‐ Yeah!

14:19.942 --> 14:22.028
Amazing! Liv is in it to win it!

14:22.153 --> 14:23.863
Argh!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.959
Huh?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.422
Boo!
(Evil laugh)

14:42.131 --> 14:43.341
‐ Aaah!

14:46.844 --> 14:48.846
(Evil laugh)

14:57.146 --> 15:00.733
Which ghost
did the Ghost Force... ?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.778
‐ Arak Gum, the giant spider!
‐ Wow, Liv!

15:03.903 --> 15:05.655
You really know your stuff!

15:05.738 --> 15:08.157
Charlie didn't even finish
the question!

15:08.157 --> 15:12.453
‐ I guess I'm just lucky!
‐ Aaah!

15:17.250 --> 15:18.876
(Evil laugh)

15:25.216 --> 15:28.302
Oh, no, no!
No! Not another ghost!

15:30.888 --> 15:32.014
Oh, no!

15:32.181 --> 15:33.641
(Laughter)

15:34.892 --> 15:37.145
Psst! Liv! Mike!

15:42.275 --> 15:44.110
‐ My lucky charm!
‐ Huh?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.778
(Evil laugh)

15:56.205 --> 15:57.123
Aaah!

16:00.001 --> 16:02.128
(Evil laugh)

16:02.253 --> 16:03.754
‐ Ghost!
‐ Oh!

16:07.466 --> 16:09.093
(Evil laugh)

16:13.181 --> 16:16.767
‐ It merged with my lucky charm!
‐ We'll get it back!

16:17.768 --> 16:19.770
ALL: Let's go, Ghost Force!

16:20.771 --> 16:23.399
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

16:28.821 --> 16:30.114
Fury!

16:31.115 --> 16:32.408
Krush!

16:33.784 --> 16:34.952
Myst!

16:38.497 --> 16:39.999
Ghost Force!

16:52.637 --> 16:53.971
Mmm‐hmm.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.015
‐ Your turn.
‐ FURY: Ms Jones,

16:56.015 --> 16:59.143
we've got a bogey
in Central Park!

16:59.143 --> 17:01.020
Oh, right. Glowboo and I

17:01.145 --> 17:03.272
were just in the middle
of a chess match.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.567
The lucky devil's already
beaten me 18 times in a row!

17:06.692 --> 17:07.944
That's more than luck,

17:08.110 --> 17:09.445
but we're dealing

17:09.445 --> 17:10.529
with a fiercer
opponent here.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.782
Indeed. That's Stretchy,

17:13.366 --> 17:15.910
a level‐7 merger ghost.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.870
Yeah.
It merged with my lucky charm!

17:18.037 --> 17:21.082
Hold on. I'm sending Glowboo
in for backup!

17:21.207 --> 17:24.126
‐ Checkmate.
‐ Argh! Not again.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.796
(Screaming)

17:27.171 --> 17:28.339
Aaah!

17:29.966 --> 17:32.468
‐ We gotta neutralise its fists!
‐ On it!

17:39.767 --> 17:43.187
‐ Hope they have insurance!
‐ Spectral Gate!

17:45.523 --> 17:47.316
Fractal mace!

17:53.948 --> 17:56.617
That ball of yarn could sure use
a knitting needle!

18:02.248 --> 18:05.251
‐ Aaah!
‐ (Gasps) My bad!

18:05.376 --> 18:07.753
Not so lucky without your charm,
huh?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.423
It's heading to Fifth Avenue!
We've gotta stop it!

18:17.221 --> 18:19.056
I'll handle our fuzzy friend!

18:22.476 --> 18:23.769
Second time lucky!

18:26.272 --> 18:27.648
What the... ?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.657
Krush! Watch out!

18:39.076 --> 18:40.286
Aaah!

18:49.170 --> 18:50.338
Krush!

18:50.504 --> 18:52.423
(Mocking laugh)

18:52.590 --> 18:53.758
Myst!

18:58.054 --> 18:59.639
What?

18:59.764 --> 19:02.725
Glowboo! Not a second too late!

19:02.725 --> 19:05.603
My internal clock
is highly accurate.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.441
My shield will not stand
for long... We need to retreat!

19:10.441 --> 19:14.028
What're you waiting for, Myst?
Use a portal right now!

19:14.153 --> 19:15.154
Hurry!

19:19.325 --> 19:23.079
‐ What's up with you, sis?
‐ I'm jinxed, that's what!

19:26.540 --> 19:28.959
You appear to be
in optimal condition.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.463
I mean, I'm all out of luck.
I can't do anything right

19:32.588 --> 19:35.341
ever since that ghost
merged with my lucky charm.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.468
(Screaming)

19:39.011 --> 19:41.263
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ On it!

19:43.974 --> 19:46.644
C'mon, I was joking about that!

19:46.769 --> 19:49.438
This is no joke!
All my arrows missed!

19:49.814 --> 19:52.024
And now Krush is down
thanks to me.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.693
Maybe I should sit this one out.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.528
The jinx is all in your head,

19:55.653 --> 19:57.321
making you lose your mojo.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.908
Oh! Please! Uh... maybe
I can give you a discount!

20:01.075 --> 20:02.702
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ Whoa!

20:06.414 --> 20:08.874
Oh!
My official hot‐dog provider!

20:08.999 --> 20:10.835
This is going too far!

20:11.168 --> 20:13.671
Whaddaya say
we unravel that ball of yarn?

20:13.671 --> 20:16.215
Glowboo, you blind it,
I'll grab its fists

20:16.340 --> 20:18.008
and Myst will do the rest, OK?

20:18.134 --> 20:20.010
‐ Are you sure? I...
‐ Boo‐firmative.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.520
You're up!

20:39.613 --> 20:41.449
It's over, wool‐ball!

20:54.378 --> 20:56.130
‐ Whoa!
‐ That's cheating!

20:59.467 --> 21:01.218
Oh!

21:05.848 --> 21:06.724
Oh, no!

21:12.521 --> 21:14.106
Glowboo!

21:20.821 --> 21:22.990
Talk about fists of fury!

21:36.712 --> 21:38.339
Ha!

21:49.391 --> 21:51.393
(Evil laugh)

21:53.687 --> 21:55.022
Spectral Gate!

22:10.663 --> 22:12.498
Your knitting days are over.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.461
'Cause I got my mojo back!

22:19.171 --> 22:20.464
Octocat!

22:59.128 --> 23:03.340
Good job, guys! Myst,
that really was a smart move.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.676
Well, it took me a while
to figure it out,

23:05.676 --> 23:08.387
but kicking butt
comes from the heart,

23:08.512 --> 23:10.055
not from some lousy keychain!

23:10.681 --> 23:12.057
ALL: Boo‐yah!

23:18.439 --> 23:22.276
All right... Ready
for round two, Ghost fans?

23:22.401 --> 23:25.571
I'm out. Can't compete with Liv
and her lucky charm.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.781
Oh, come on,
quit being superstitious.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.075
You can even have it,
if you want.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.914
Let's do this!
So, which fanged phantom

23:34.997 --> 23:37.917
did the Ghost Force defeat
by the skin of their teeth?

23:38.918 --> 23:41.503
‐ Er, the Molar Ghost?
‐ Wrong!

23:41.503 --> 23:43.547
And you just made that up,
didn't you?

23:43.631 --> 23:46.842
‐ The correct answer is ‐‐
‐ Sharkoak!

23:46.842 --> 23:48.761
Told ya.
I don't need my lucky charm!

23:48.928 --> 23:51.388
(Laughter)
