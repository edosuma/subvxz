I think the public
may lose faith in the Bureau,

11:32.609 --> 11:34.987
once they learn
that you squandered

11:35.069 --> 11:37.197
the chance to prevent
another attack.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.577
I'm not gonna be strong-armed,

11:38.656 --> 11:40.499
not by you,
not after today.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.960
Then I suggest
you start taking

11:42.035 --> 11:43.537
my client's words seriously.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.621
DiPIERRO: This is unreal.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.957
The country's under attack,
and you're protecting him?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.920
Wellick was targeted,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.970
because of his access
and credentials at E Corp.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.136
These terrorists threatened
his wife and son

11:56.216 --> 11:57.513
if he didn't comply.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.806
For five straight months,

11:58.885 --> 12:01.308
my client was held captive
in a basement.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.730
You can't expect us
to buy this.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.102
We have confirmation.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.733
Wellick gave
an unauthorized order

12:05.808 --> 12:08.027
to put server CS30
back on the network,

12:08.269 --> 12:09.942
the same night
the hack was initiated,

12:10.021 --> 12:11.739
all while being
investigated for murder.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.236
Yeah, a charge
for which he's been cleared.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.488
DiPIERRO: That doesn't change
the facts.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.569
Wellick got passed over
for CTO,

12:16.653 --> 12:18.655
got fired, two days later,
disappears,

12:18.738 --> 12:21.116
and now, hours before
the largest terror attack ever

12:21.199 --> 12:24.248
on U.S. soil, VVellick resurfaces,
claiming he was kidnapped.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.168
So, what,
are you charging my client

12:27.247 --> 12:29.170
with coincidental resurfacing?

12:29.582 --> 12:30.925
We don't call that coincidence
around here.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.092
We call it bullshit. Dom...

12:32.168 --> 12:34.387
We have motive.
Yeah, with no hard evidence.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.842
But here's what you do have.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.269
You have a guy
that'll point you

12:41.344 --> 12:43.346
to the terrorists
who held him hostage,

12:43.721 --> 12:46.770
the actual people
behind the attacks,

12:47.016 --> 12:50.361
the same ones planning
more destruction.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.359
Mr. Wellick can ID them,

12:52.522 --> 12:54.274
and tell you
their likely location,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.780
in exchange for protection
and immunity.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.985
We're not gonna cut a deal.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.572
We're gonna charge him and just add
obstruction of justice on top of it.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.656
You saw the video.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.118
Time is not a luxury
that you have,

13:05.201 --> 13:08.205
not with another attack
on the horizon, so...

13:09.205 --> 13:10.832
do you really wanna sit here

13:10.915 --> 13:13.464
and continue to quibble
about Mr. Wellick?

13:17.547 --> 13:18.719
DiPIERRO: Let's just
round them all up,

13:19.007 --> 13:21.385
Darlene, Elliot, Angela Moss.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.469
Let's just haul 'em all
in here and go at 'em hard.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.850
Wellick's lawyer
is right.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.439
Time is not
our friend here.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.190
And if Tyrell can get us
two workable leads...

13:28.266 --> 13:29.313
We're being played!

13:29.934 --> 13:31.151
How do you not see this?

13:31.436 --> 13:33.109
I still think
the Dark Army's involved,

13:33.229 --> 13:34.947
and bringing in the others
might expose that.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.320
I have to brief Comey,

13:36.399 --> 13:37.992
and he has to brief
the President.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.199
I won't go to them with
half-assed theories again,

13:40.278 --> 13:41.530
not when this much
is on the line.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.114
Why do you keep ignoring
our credible sources?

13:43.197 --> 13:45.495
The most credible one
being in that room.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.539
Tyrell Wellick's
name alone

13:47.618 --> 13:49.336
is going to play better
with them than the others.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.459
Play better?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.915
Are you already wondering
how this is gonna look?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.134
You wanna cover this up
to the FBI Director

13:55.209 --> 13:56.756
and the President
of the United States?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.179
Spare me
the conspiracy theories.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.631
I need to bring them
something concrete.

13:59.714 --> 14:00.715
And if Wellick's lying?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.638
Then this deal is off,
and we have our guy.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.056
It's a win-win for us,
either way.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.352
Why are you fighting
with me on this?

14:05.428 --> 14:06.930
Because something's
not adding up.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.442
What's that
supposed to mean?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.573

because you're overworked
