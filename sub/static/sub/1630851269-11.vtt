00:55.656 --> 01:00.159
Two months of rain have
transformed the manor.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.603
What was once a dry,
and desperate landscape

01:11.839 --> 01:15.908
Is now an edenri,
ch with possibility.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.249
But this new, green kalahari

01:24.518 --> 01:27.619
Is not quite
the paradise it appears.

01:30.257 --> 01:37.529
Every change in the environment
herachlds a ange in fortune.

has a cloud.

[birds chirp]

01:56.183 --> 01:59.551
The summer downpours

01:59.787 --> 02:03.455
Of tall sourgrass
acro ess thentire manor.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.560
Which, when you're
less than 12 inches tall,

02:08.796 --> 02:11.095
Makes it extremely
uldiffict to see...

02:11.232 --> 02:13.298
Or be seen.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.708
At the hakuna maurtata brow

02:23.944 --> 02:26.311
It's not just the height
of the grass

02:26.547 --> 02:29.148
That is proving to be
an irritation.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.451
The sap is causingin
eye fections

02:33.654 --> 02:36.755
And itchy sores
on everyone's skin.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.693

She's been allowed h home toelp

04:13.654 --> 04:16.388
Now that she is no longer
a threat to them

04:18.425 --> 04:20.759
But she's living
on a knife-edge...

04:20.861 --> 04:22.694
D
anshe knows it.

04:26.133 --> 04:30.034
So she's sucking up big time.

[squeaks]

04:42.082 --> 04:44.716
[cackles]

04:44.985 --> 04:48.119
The problem is her incessant
gr aoomingnd caressing

04:48.389 --> 04:51.823
Is just becoming another
irritation, to flint.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.606
The tall grass
is causing similar problems

05:08.742 --> 05:10.409
For thkee whisrs.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.280
The difference
is swift's youngest pups -

05:15.482 --> 05:17.582
Woolf, bronte and wilde -

05:17.818 --> 05:21.253
Are 7 weeks old and   well
on their way to independence.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.626
The trio arer bigge
than most pups their age -

05:28.896 --> 05:33.198
Thanks to the banquet of bugs
triggered by the sraummer ins.

05:34.601 --> 05:38.437
In fact, there are round bellies
everywhere you look.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.713
The pups are now old enougmoh o
ve with the rest of thlye fami

05:48.015 --> 05:52.017
So swift can lead them
to a better place to stay...

05:53.587 --> 05:56.254
...If they can
find their way to it!

05:58.625 --> 06:02.661
Young lueppin kes look-out
for approaching danger.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.997
And he's not the only one.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.634
A lark panics...

06:13.574 --> 06:15.707
At the sight of
a pack of predators.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.146
The flustered parent
is protecting a chick

06:21.281 --> 06:23.415
Somewhere on the ground.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.953
It would make a good
mealfor someone.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.024
But it could be anywhere.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.830
Thsecond parent
hits the panic button...

06:39.099 --> 06:43.368
...Seemingly offering a clue
to the locofation  its young.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.040
The clever lark is a decoy -

06:49.243 --> 06:52.377
To lure the wh
iskers away from the chick.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.554
Their deception outsmarts hachi!

07:05.826 --> 07:09.394
T
buunfortunatheely, t tactic
didn't work on laika...

07:09.696 --> 07:14.299
O'
whs already tucking into
her chick meal for one.

07:15.669 --> 07:19.304
Whiskers 1 - larks nil.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.575
Orpredats come in many guises.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.815
Swift would do well
to remember that

07:30.951 --> 07:33.452
As she leads hiler famy on.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.402
Meanwhile, unable to venture
far from their burrow,

07:50.604 --> 07:54.773
The hakuna matata are heading up
a nearby dune,

07:55.008 --> 07:57.442
To get othut of e grass.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.851
Finnick is first
to reach the top.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.791
His view across the manor
is now very different

08:13.126 --> 08:16.495
From the bleak dustbowl
the family h tas hado endure

08:16.730 --> 08:18.830
For so much of the year.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.266
But this highpoint doesn't offer

08:22.503 --> 08:25.237
The safe foraging
they were hoping for.

08:27.741 --> 08:32.077
Ndthe wi up here makes it hard
to hear predators.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.212
Exposed in the open,

08:35.449 --> 08:39.885
It would be all sytoo ea
for a raptor to strike.

08:52.132 --> 08:56.134
Perhaps this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.713
Back at the burrow,

09:08.982 --> 09:11.716
His roving adventures curtailed
by the long grass,

09:11.952 --> 09:14.719
Young gurke is patiently
helping his aunties

09:14.888 --> 09:17.322
Babysit the new kids.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.792

for days.

09:23.363 --> 09:27.198
Beneath him, in the network
nd   of uerground tunnels,

09:27.334 --> 09:30.235
Somethintig is srring.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.143
[squeaks]

09:43.817 --> 09:46.484
It's flint's new litter!

09:48.288 --> 09:52.857
The five tiny pups stumble
their way towards the entrance,

09:53.760 --> 09:56.094
Accompanied by sencha.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.635
First to appear is seymour.

10:05.839 --> 10:11.209
Asthen yha, mooncake,
reef and mae.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.645
The 3 boys and 2 girls

10:13.914 --> 10:17.649
Ve emerged several days
earlier than expected.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.853
They're far too young to leave
the saf fety othe burrow

10:22.089 --> 10:24.956
But sencha isn't concerned.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.762

s them  to suckle.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.702
[squeaks]

10:42.342 --> 10:45.276
Munchkin can't provide mililk
whe she's pregnant

10:45.479 --> 10:49.414
She keeps guard instead.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.252
She can't afford
anything to go wrong.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.089
If she gets kicked out,

10:58.291 --> 11:02.560
She will very likely
miscarry her own pups.

Bur t theiinnocent play is
about to be rudely interrupted.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.121
Still agitated from his
experience on the dune,

11:30.424 --> 11:33.924
Finnick is horrified to see
his pups in the open...

11:34.094 --> 11:36.161
And leaps into action.

11:37.864 --> 11:38.863
But instead of shepherding them

11:39.099 --> 11:41.566
Back into the safety
of the burrow,

11:43.336 --> 11:45.870
He de oes thunthinkable...

11:47.140 --> 11:50.008
...And starts moving the!M away

11:56.249 --> 11:58.183
What is he doing??

12:11.164 --> 12:13.965
Reef and seymour
are now out in tn,he ope

12:14.334 --> 12:19.404
Away from the burrow and no-one
seems to know what to do.

Over in whiskers territory,
keeping everyone together

12:29.883 --> 12:32.450
P
isroving just as
nerve-wracking for swift

12:32.719 --> 12:37.355
As she searches for a burrow
free of sourgrass.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.926
The difference is,
or  her ganised move

12:42.062 --> 12:44.362
Could be about to pay off.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.002
Finally, the grass r..Ecedes.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.840
And swift's plan...
Is revealed.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.682

rollo, ragnar and floki.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.921
What a sight for sore eyes!

13:12.259 --> 13:15.660
And an ingenious move
on swift's part.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.765
Agrazednd trampled
by their old neighbours,

13:20.934 --> 13:24.435
The grass is not a problem here.

13:24.738 --> 13:27.705
Th and e old place still has
all the welcome features

13:27.941 --> 13:31.643
That made ita  such good
family home earlier in the year.

has moved in.

on highe.R prey

Bit's aad day to be a bird.

15:28.695 --> 15:32.297
Swift won't tolerate
such a deadly neighbour...

So the whiskers' que

15:55.320 --> 15:58.523
What should be a safe home

For the latest

He seems to have

to the burrow.

But what about the others?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.570
Gurke retrieves yasha...

It's been a long day

catches her eye.

How strange.

The surroundings are lush
but not overwhelming.

22:20.406 --> 22:24.541
D the water tank
is like a fortress

22:24.811 --> 22:28.379
With a reinforced bunk
er and  protected sentry positis

22:28.581 --> 22:32.049
Which lupin seems
more than happy with.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.787
Yes.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.856
This will do nicely.

22:45.231 --> 22:48.699
But as the whiskers settle down
in their old home,

22:50.436 --> 22:54.871
Some membethrs of e family
are carrying a secret...

22:55.108 --> 22:58.676
One that cannot be hidden
for much longer...

22:59.645 --> 23:00.745
And one which owes less

23:01.047 --> 23:04.615
To the abundance of food
brought by the rains...

23:04.917 --> 23:08.486
Than it does to the persistence
of rovers.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.890
Swift's tolerance
of her daughters

23:14.093 --> 23:18.095
Is about to tebe tesd
m   onceore.

23:23.835 --> 23:33.644
