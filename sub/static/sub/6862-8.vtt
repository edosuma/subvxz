WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:04.572
Lemon, I cannot marry you,
not when a part of me is
in love with someone else.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.507
You don't know who you
are without Lemon.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.110
You're asking me
to date other people.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.544
I was just wondering
if you could do casual

00:10.578 --> 00:12.513
my way-- monogamous.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.115
Yeah, I think
I can do that.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.316
Lavon and I have put
all that election

00:15.349 --> 00:16.584
nonsense behind us.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.651
I'm hoping you
and I can, too.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.820
I'm gonna go while you're
still wearing things.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.422
She still hates me.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.790
Ruby doesn't get
to swoop in and take him.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.292
I saw him first.
No, you didn't.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.626
We were in love once,

00:25.659 --> 00:27.228
and Lord help me,
I still think I am.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.629
You think you could
be happy here?

00:28.662 --> 00:30.498
I know how important
your career is.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.799
I'm here now-- that's
all that matters.

00:31.832 --> 00:32.800
Let's just take
it day by day.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.138
WADE:
 I-I just don't see
 what the problem is.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.406
ZOE:
 I am tired

00:38.439 --> 00:40.274
of faking it;
I'm not good at it.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.709
Yeah, I know,
every time you try,

00:41.742 --> 00:43.644
you get that goofy little
smile on your face, like...

00:43.677 --> 00:45.113
Guh...
Oh!

00:45.146 --> 00:47.515
Shut up, I'm serious.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.817
Why do I have to pretend
to like Ruby Jeffries?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.819
Because you're
Lavon's friend, okay,

00:51.852 --> 00:52.820
and that's what
friends do.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.423
No, what about honesty,
integrity?

00:55.456 --> 00:57.525
What kind of world is it
where we have to pretend?

00:57.558 --> 00:58.526
(knocking on door)

00:58.559 --> 01:00.394
GEORGE:
Hey, Wade, you in there?

01:00.428 --> 01:02.263
Holy crap, it's George;
you got to get rid of him.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.532
Uh, door's open, Tucker.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.100
What are you doing?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.301
(laughs)

01:07.335 --> 01:09.570
(sighs)

01:09.603 --> 01:10.371
Hey, man.
Hey, bud.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.107
Just bringing back
your fishing gear.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.543
And I'm going
for a jog

01:15.576 --> 01:16.544
in a little bit.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.778
Do you want
to tag along?

01:17.811 --> 01:18.846
I'm feeling pretty
beat right now,

01:18.879 --> 01:20.281
so I'll pass.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.683
Getting soft
in your old age, huh?

01:22.716 --> 01:23.717
Big night or something?

01:23.751 --> 01:26.387
Aren't they all?
Uh...

01:26.420 --> 01:28.389
I'll take a rain check
on that run, all right?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.089
Yeah, yeah, man,

01:29.123 --> 01:30.458
all right.
All right, buddy.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.294
See you.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.365
(clears throat)

01:37.398 --> 01:39.600
Geez, have a whole
conversation, why don't you?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.135
You, uh,

01:41.169 --> 01:42.670
you find anything interesting
back there--

01:42.703 --> 01:45.673
m-my socks,
your dignity?

01:45.706 --> 01:47.841
Tell me again
why we can't just tell Tucker

01:47.875 --> 01:49.377
what's going on between us.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.478
Because he's
our friend.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.781
So, Lavon's our friend,
we got to be honest with him,

01:53.814 --> 01:58.619
and Tucker's our friend
and we hide behind beds.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.853
You know, this is
real complicated.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.389
I think I'd better
write this down.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.257
It's not the same
thing and you know it.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.592
We can't be honest with
George now; it's too late.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.760
We tell him the truth,
he won't understand

02:06.794 --> 02:08.729
and he will hate us
forever-- both of us.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.763
So, what,
we just keep this

02:09.797 --> 02:12.333
a big secret
until we all die?

02:12.366 --> 02:14.468
That would be the
mature thing to do.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.307
You don't think
he saw us, do you?

02:19.340 --> 02:20.541
Now you ask.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.476
(Ruby laughs)

02:22.510 --> 02:26.480
Mmm... are you really gonna
cut them onions that thin?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.349
What?
What?

02:28.382 --> 02:30.551
LAVON:
Are you questioning
my culinary prowess?

02:30.584 --> 02:31.752
RUBY:
No.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.187
Morning, Z,
you want a omelet?

02:33.221 --> 02:36.924
Uh, no, you know,
I am going egg-free.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.692
Oh.
Since when?

02:38.726 --> 02:39.960
Starting today, now.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.395
RUBY:
Hmm.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.531
Wow, you don't know
what you're missing.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.433
Looks like I'm missing
"No Pants Saturday."

02:47.435 --> 02:48.936
RUBY:
I better go put
some clothes on.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.571
Hey, do you want to come
to dinner tonight?

02:50.604 --> 02:52.206
Lavon's cooking.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.542
Maybe, but
I wouldn't count on me.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.110
Okay.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.351
You need to get
on board with this.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.718
Ruby is my girlfriend.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.288
What? I'm being nice.
No, you're not even trying.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.822
I can tell because of the way
you scrunch your nose

03:08.856 --> 03:10.524
every time I say
"girlfriend."

03:10.558 --> 03:12.826
Ah, yeah, see?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.396
Maybe my nose is just worried

03:15.429 --> 03:16.964
that Ruby Jeffries is never
gonna stay in BlueBell

03:16.997 --> 03:18.299
and you're gonna get hurt.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.300
I said it.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.701
And why would your nose...?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.303
(chuckles)

03:22.336 --> 03:23.571
Why would you...?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.273
Because I get
Ruby Jeffries.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.740
I am Ruby Jeffries.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.276
You know, if it wasn't
for some weird alignment

03:28.309 --> 03:29.142
of the universe,

03:29.176 --> 03:30.678
I wouldn't have stuck
around BlueBell.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.546
Plus, you told me that
her own grandfather said

03:32.580 --> 03:33.547
that she wouldn't.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.015
I told you that
in confidence,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.684
not so you could use it
against me.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.286
You told me that
because I'm your friend.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.854
Yeah, that's right,
so be my friend.

03:40.888 --> 03:41.989
Ruby's trying.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.691
She's been nothing
but nice to you, Zoe.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.259
Whatever--
what do you want me to do?

03:45.293 --> 03:46.460
You know, I'm already faking it.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.262
Fake it better.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.464
You can start tonight at dinner.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.733
(sighs)

03:55.569 --> 03:57.471
Wade Kinsella, you are
the answer to my prayers.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.607
Can't believe
I finally found you.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.608
Uh, well, it shouldn't
be that hard, Reverend,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.009
I'm always here.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.011
What can I do for you
and the, uh, big guy?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.012
Look, uh...

04:05.045 --> 04:06.714
our Eagle Ranger troop
is going

04:06.747 --> 04:08.349
on a camping trip
tonight,

04:08.382 --> 04:11.419
and my co-leader came down
with food poisoning.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.487
I'm just desperate to have
someone fill in, and,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.423
well, you were
my first choice.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.290
(laughs)

04:16.324 --> 04:18.358
Really, I was your
first choice to lead

04:18.392 --> 04:19.793
a bunch of kids
into the wilderness?

04:19.827 --> 04:20.761
What, you want
me to teach 'em

04:20.793 --> 04:22.896
how much gin goes into
an Alabama Slammer?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.432
Come on now,

04:24.465 --> 04:27.401
as I recall, you were
an Eagle Ranger yourself.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.037
For all of one day,
and even at age ten,

04:30.070 --> 04:32.740
I wasn't a big fan
of organized groups--

04:32.773 --> 04:33.974
n-no offense to your own.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.810
Uh, sorry, Rev,
not for me.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.046
Coffee's at the end of
the bar; help yourself.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.650
Well, well, twice
in one day, look at that.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.685
Tucker, what you doing here?
I thought you went for a run.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.720
Nah, I thought better of it;
sounded like work.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.657
Listen, would you want to hit
Tricky Rick's tonight?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.891
Maybe get
a couple of drinks?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.593
You asking me out on a date?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.395
I just got something
I need to talk to you about.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.897
You know, maybe
somewhere not so public.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.566
You kinda got that lawyer look.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.435
I'm not on trial, right?
(chuckles)

05:01.469 --> 05:03.837
Nah, I just need, like,
an hour of your time.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.907
Well I'd love to,
but the thing is

05:06.940 --> 05:09.009
I'm-I'm leading the
Eagle Ranger camping trip.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.345
Yeah, they're counting on me.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.814
So, sorry about that.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.749
All right.

05:15.783 --> 05:19.019
Some... some other time, then.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.891
And that's why
Canadians don't eat cheese.
(chuckles)

05:23.924 --> 05:25.626
Reverend, count me in.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.860
Really?! Why?

05:26.894 --> 05:27.895
Well, I just feel like it's time

05:27.928 --> 05:29.697
for me to give back, you know?

05:29.730 --> 05:33.567
Hell, maybe I can take one of
these trips every weekend.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.868
When do we leave?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.105
I tell you,
I'm developing

05:38.138 --> 05:41.375
a serious case of affection
for this little town.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.110
The historic sites,
this bakery,

05:43.143 --> 05:44.978
the local medical professionals.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.848
Well, it's my duty
to inform you,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.617
there may not be
a cure for that.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.890
Hello, Magnolia.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.559
Oh, Emily.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.428
Not bored
of our little town yet?

06:00.461 --> 06:01.962
It's a little slice
of paradise.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.030
(all chuckle)

06:03.063 --> 06:05.132
Hey, there.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.834
Did you just text me?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.736
I was just looking for you.
Come on.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.771
Do not ever text me!

06:10.804 --> 06:12.740
Do you know how
embarrassing that is?

06:12.773 --> 06:15.108
Lucas was holding my phone
when I got

06:15.142 --> 06:17.144
a smiley-face text
from my father.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.613
I am sorry, but there's
something I need to ask you.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.750
You know how you're always
complaining about my cooking

06:22.783 --> 06:25.586
and about how I have no taste,
so I can't buy you any clothes?

06:25.619 --> 06:26.620
Uh-huh.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.889
Well, tell me...

06:28.922 --> 06:31.959
how would you feel
if I was to invite Emily

06:31.992 --> 06:33.561
to move to BlueBell?

06:33.594 --> 06:36.530
Maybe live with us?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.969
You know that feeling you get
when you wake up in

06:42.002 --> 06:43.170
the middle of the night

06:43.203 --> 06:45.873
and you're sure you're
going to vomit?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.509
I'd feel like that...
only forever.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.113
See, Martha Stewart did not
become Martha Stewart

06:53.146 --> 06:55.115
by selling gourmet foods
to just her friends.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.485
She expanded her
"brand awareness."

06:57.518 --> 06:59.052
And that is what
we need to do.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.921
Lemon, did you go
to business school

07:00.954 --> 07:02.556
when I wasn't looking?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.458
If you subscribe
to the right magazines,

07:04.492 --> 07:06.126
you don't have to go
to business school.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.096
Besides, thinking about
our catering company

07:09.129 --> 07:11.699
keeps me from thinking
about Lavon, so...

07:14.635 --> 07:16.203
Come on, one drink.
We'll see what happens.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.138
Ooh...

07:18.171 --> 07:20.474
(chuckles)

07:20.508 --> 07:22.976
I think we both know
what's going to happen,

07:23.010 --> 07:24.144
which is why I'm saying no.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.979
And yet, you're
still standing here,

07:26.013 --> 07:28.081
so part of you must be
intrigued by my proposal.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.485
All right.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.053
(gasps)
RUBY: One drink.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.622
That's all.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.160
Positively scandalous!

07:40.193 --> 07:41.862
In the daylight hours, too.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.896
(gasps)

07:42.930 --> 07:45.866
Oh, poor Lavon.

07:45.899 --> 07:50.203
Oh, no... I know that look.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.606
Lemon, this is
not our business.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.577
You do not do
anything crazy.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.045
Do I ever?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.932
No. No, no, no.
Hey, you said
you would listen to me,

08:18.966 --> 08:20.868
and you didn't
even let me finish.
Because when you finish,

08:20.901 --> 08:22.002
I'm know I'm going
to say no,

08:22.035 --> 08:23.270
so I figured
I would get it over with.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.271
This sounds
like a scheme.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.606
It is not a scheme,
all right?

08:25.639 --> 08:26.607
It is the right
thing to do.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.609
We cannot go to Lavon

08:28.642 --> 08:29.877
until we have all
the information.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.044
See? You keep saying "we,"
but I'm not...

08:31.078 --> 08:32.546
I need you.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.147
As a doctor, you are in
a unique position;

08:34.181 --> 08:35.215
people open up to you.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.683
I'll point the guy out,

08:36.717 --> 08:38.018
and you're gonna go
talk to him.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.688
Tell him that there's
an outbreak of Ebola

08:40.721 --> 08:42.022
or Legionnaire's Disease
or whatever,

08:42.054 --> 08:44.124
and all out-of-towners have
to be checked.

08:44.157 --> 08:47.160
And then, when you're examine
him, you get him to confirm

08:47.194 --> 08:49.062
whether or not he's Ruby
Jeffries' secret lover.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.298
In your head, what would qualify
as a scheme?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.635
MAYFAIR:
Make a big pile over here.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.136
(clapping hands)

08:56.169 --> 08:58.672
Set it down.
Get it neat.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.773
Everybody, jump out, line up.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.675
Let's go!

09:01.709 --> 09:03.143
Line up here.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.045
Welcome to the Wilderness,
Eagle Rangers.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.680
Now, take a deep breath.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.949
That's the fresh air
of nature's playground.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.752
And it's all ours
for the next 24 hours!

09:11.785 --> 09:14.788
Anything you want to add?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.724
Uh...

09:16.757 --> 09:18.659
try not to get killed
by snakes.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.160
Okay. Words of wisdom.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.029
Now... let's buddy up.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.030
You two...

09:23.063 --> 09:24.932
Sorry I'm late.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.634
What the hell?
Who invited Tucker?

09:26.667 --> 09:27.801
He volunteered.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.637
I figure we could
use the help.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.072
You know George was
a Eagle Ranger for 12 years!

09:32.105 --> 09:33.273
Hey, you want me

09:33.306 --> 09:35.075
to give the "Welcome
to the Wilderness" speech?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.209
It's been covered.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.611
Oh, okay.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.946
Well, man,
this is gonna be great.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.047
I love camping,
and it looks like

09:40.080 --> 09:41.348
we'll finally
get our chance to chat.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.816
Okay, George,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.084
why don't you take the lead,

09:44.117 --> 09:45.318
take the boys out
to the campsite.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.087
Of course,
of course.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.822
Eagle Rangers,
to the skies.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.223
What am I supposed to do?

09:50.257 --> 09:54.194
I need you to take care
of Connor Snelling.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.963
Connor's parents bring
him out here every year,

09:55.996 --> 09:58.031
but he never wants
to be here.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.333
I need you to make him
want to be here.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.036
Oh, yeah.
I'm the guy for that job.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.642
Hey, Connor? Hey, bud?

10:08.676 --> 10:11.144
Hey, stinky face.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.180
Hey, Connor...
come on, you don't want

10:13.213 --> 10:15.148
to miss out
on all the fun, right?

10:15.182 --> 10:16.316
What if I did?

10:16.349 --> 10:18.118
What?!

10:18.151 --> 10:19.887
What if I did want to miss out

10:19.920 --> 10:21.221
on all the fun?
Can I stay here?

10:21.254 --> 10:24.324
J-Just get up.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.258
Come on.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.395
(both chuckle)

10:28.428 --> 10:30.731
Well, they say there's
a ghost at Fort Morgan.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.165
The original caretaker

10:32.199 --> 10:34.702
was beheaded
by a cannonball.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.369
You know, Magnolia's been
studying local history.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.672
Sweetie, do you know anything
about this ghost?

10:38.706 --> 10:41.241
Honey, put down the phone.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.143
We're playing a game,
and it's your turn.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.912
(sighing):
Fine.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.414
Oh.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.016
Oh, look!

10:49.049 --> 10:51.819
I get to buy a house.

10:51.852 --> 10:55.322
But, uh-oh, it's so small,
there's only room for two.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.158
You know, looks like
there's plenty of room to me.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.293
(phone ringing)

11:00.327 --> 11:02.162
Excuse me.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.031
Dr. Breeland.
Daddy, put down the phone.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.232
I thought
we were playing a game.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.299
Yes. Uh, I understand.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.768
I'll be right there.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.437
Jerry Turner's oxygen tank
needs a refill.
Oh.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.106
I'll, uh... I'll be back
as soon as I can.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.008
EMILY: Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.917
So, should we keep playing?

11:23.951 --> 11:26.820
I have to go to the bathroom.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.189
Might be a while.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.958
Don't wait up.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.330
Hey.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.332
Dude, what are you doing?!

11:39.366 --> 11:40.333
You... you-you you bent it.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.903
What are you trying to do,
hammer it into a rock?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.205
It was like that
when I got it.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.774
No, it wasn't, 'cause
I gave it to you.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.108
You know what happens

11:48.141 --> 11:49.810
if we don't get this tent up
before dark?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.779
I get to go home
and sleep in my own bed?

11:51.812 --> 11:54.514
Look, I'll take care
of the tent, all right?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.449
You just, uh...

11:56.483 --> 11:58.251
just keep a lookout, all right?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.787
What am I looking out for?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.188
George Tucker.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.490
You got to warn me
if he starts heading this way.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.826
And if he does, uh...

12:05.859 --> 12:07.494
can you fake a seizure?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.963
No, but I can do impressions.
Want to hear my Jay Leno?

12:09.997 --> 12:11.198
God, no.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.032
Bob Costas?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.834
Not interested?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.836
Fine. Why are you
avoiding George Tucker?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.470
Well... (clears throat)

12:17.504 --> 12:19.973
It's, uh... it's complicated.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.842
All right?

12:21.875 --> 12:24.477
George Tucker-- he suspects

12:24.511 --> 12:26.980
that I have something
he believes he should have.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.316
And, uh, well, if he found out

12:29.349 --> 12:32.853
that I do, in fact,
have it, well, he'd be upset.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.855
What do you have?

12:34.888 --> 12:37.190
Well, uh...

12:37.224 --> 12:40.027
it's a, uh... it's a cookie.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.263
See-see, George thinks
I took his cookie,

12:43.296 --> 12:45.432
but brother, that cookie
wasn't his to begin with.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.067
All right?
That was a... that was a...

12:47.100 --> 12:49.970
free-range cookie, and I have
zero interest, no interest

12:50.003 --> 12:52.039
at all into entering
into any kind of

12:52.072 --> 12:54.507
cookie negotiations with him,
all right? Zero.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.077
If you need cookies, I got
a whole stash of frosted animal

12:57.110 --> 12:58.846
cookies in the...
GEORGE:
Hey, Wade?

12:58.879 --> 13:01.148
(clears throat)
Hey, uh, you got a second now?

13:01.181 --> 13:04.417
Real top-notch
looking-out, buddy.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.387
Uh, George, I'm kind of in the
middle of this whole tent thing,

13:07.420 --> 13:09.456
so may-maybe we could
do this another...

13:09.489 --> 13:10.824
(clears throat) ...time.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.460
Wade, it's just
one second, all right?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.495
All right.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.532
Um...

13:19.566 --> 13:21.969
Okay, I've been trying to think
of a good way to say this,

13:22.002 --> 13:24.037
and I guess sometimes it's just
best to come right out with it.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.005
Ah, not always.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.273
Would you mind

13:26.306 --> 13:27.941
if I were to ask Tansy out?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.544
Tansy?

13:31.578 --> 13:35.048
Yeah.
As in my
ex-wife... Tansy?

13:35.082 --> 13:36.984
Yeah, well, we were hanging out

13:37.017 --> 13:38.418
a couple weeks ago,
election day...

13:38.451 --> 13:39.853
Huh.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.589
...actually,
and, well, we...

13:42.622 --> 13:44.057
we had a real connection.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.059
And I keep on thinking
that I should maybe

13:46.093 --> 13:48.095
take her out and see
if there's anything to it.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.097
Uh-huh.
But I think
that she might be

13:50.130 --> 13:53.066
a little self-conscious
about the whole situation,

13:53.100 --> 13:55.402
unless, of course,
you were okay with it, so...

13:55.435 --> 13:58.105
what do you say?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.341
Well, well, I'll, uh...

14:01.374 --> 14:03.877
I'll marinate on it,
get back to you.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.414
Bro, what did I tell
you about hammering?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.418
LEMON:
Dr. Hart?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.420
Oh, thank God you are in.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.622
I met this nice
visitor to our town,

14:15.655 --> 14:17.157
and I am terribly concerned

14:17.190 --> 14:19.459
that he might have
a contagious case of pinkeye.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.094
TIM:
I'm so sorry to barge
in on you like this,

14:21.128 --> 14:23.096
Doctor, but Ms. Breeland
stopped me on the street

14:23.130 --> 14:24.097
and said my eye
looked infected.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.966
Did she now?
Didn't even notice,

14:25.999 --> 14:28.401
but she insisted, and it is
starting to ache a little.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.203
Lemon, a minute?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.504
I don't think we have
a minute, Dr. Hart.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.373
I mean, shouldn't you
examine Mister...?

14:33.406 --> 14:34.641
Uh, Bunnell.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.209
I mean, we don't want him
to remember BlueBell

14:36.243 --> 14:37.510
as the town
where he went blind

14:37.544 --> 14:39.246
due to the negligence
of its doctor.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.280
(Tim laughs)
You know what?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.015
Go on. I'll wait right here.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.616
Dr. Hart is our second-best

14:43.650 --> 14:45.485
doctor in town,
and you can just

14:45.518 --> 14:47.254
tell her anything.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.555
Please.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.557
Right.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.963
There's no inflammation.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.365
Oh, that's a relief.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.133
You know how it is--
as soon as someone says

15:00.167 --> 15:01.368
your eye look red,
they just start to itch.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.104
Right. I have
to apologize on behalf

15:04.137 --> 15:05.939
of our aggressively
compassionate townspeople.

15:05.973 --> 15:06.673
Oh, it's no problem.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.408
It's a welcome change

15:08.441 --> 15:10.010
from the impersonal,
cold-blooded people of Dallas.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.012
Dallas.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.214
That's a long way away.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.648
You passing through?
Visiting friends?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.017
A special someone?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.118
Actually, I'm here on business.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.153
Really? What kind of business?

15:20.187 --> 15:21.955
Corporate headhunter.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.991
A big fashion company--
you'd recognize the name--

15:24.024 --> 15:26.326
hired me to find
them their new CEO.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.328
Oh, okay, and,
uh, you thought

15:28.361 --> 15:30.297
you'd find him
right here in BlueBell?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.966
Well, without giving
away any state secrets,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.734
your town is hiding one
of the most sought-after

15:34.767 --> 15:36.403
CEO candidates in the country.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.071
But not for long.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.372
I believe we got her.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.541
You don't say.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.243
I'll be right back.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.617
So...?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.219
So, she's not sleeping with him,

15:52.252 --> 15:54.521
but she is going
to break Lavon's heart.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.189
(whispering):
Why did you drag me into this?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.594
WADE:
Dude!

16:01.628 --> 16:03.296
Dude, you can't be here, man.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.732
Everybody's on the hike.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.700
I figured I'd stay around

16:07.734 --> 16:09.769
in case they got massacred
in the woods.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.571
Someone should call the cops.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.206
Besides, you're here.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.574
Well, yeah, but I'm
an adult, okay?

16:14.607 --> 16:15.808
I'm allowed to be.

16:15.842 --> 16:19.112
Plus, you know, I need some
time to myself to think, so...

16:19.146 --> 16:21.014
George Tucker mad
about that cookie?
No.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.615
He-he doesn't even know
about it, all right?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.584
He wanted to talk to me about
something else. Can I...?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.186
What?
Well...

16:26.219 --> 16:27.387
(clears his throat)

16:27.420 --> 16:29.389
It's about a, uh...

16:29.422 --> 16:30.590
It's about a brownie

16:30.623 --> 16:32.492
that used to be
in my kitchen,

16:32.525 --> 16:34.261
and, uh... and he found
it out in the woods,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.263
and he wanted to know
if it would be all right

16:36.296 --> 16:37.430
if he took it.
You-you following me?

16:37.464 --> 16:40.500
So, you're fighting
about a giant cookie,

16:40.533 --> 16:43.503
and there's a brownie
in the woods.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.638
I should have gone on that hike.
I like brownies.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.773
Point is,

16:46.806 --> 16:49.276
if I let him have the brownie,

16:49.309 --> 16:52.379
then George won't have
any room for the cookie, right?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.147
Why not? You give George
the brownie,

16:54.181 --> 16:56.549
and you keep the cookie.
Problem solved.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.288
No?! What do you mean, "no"?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.156
I mean no.
That's my answer.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.457
You cannot date Tansy.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.093
No, no and no.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.708
I don't get it.
Ruby said

17:21.741 --> 17:23.510
she was getting a
manicure this afternoon.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.544
The good news is,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.846
it looks like she's not
sleeping with another guy.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.415
How is that good news?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.783
I never thought
she was.
Well, I did.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.785
You know, before
I spoke with Tim.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.454
I mean, he's the guy who...

17:34.487 --> 17:35.522
I heard.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.557
How does any of this qualify
as you being supportive?

17:37.590 --> 17:38.725
Lavon, don't you think

17:38.758 --> 17:40.227
you're getting mad
at the wrong person here?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.429
Look, I am just
as upset as you are.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.399
Okay, maybe not just as,
but in the same ballpark.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.834
You know.
I should have
seen this coming.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.769
She was never going to
stick around BlueBell.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.171
You were right.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.605
Sometimes I hate being right.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.842
RUBY:
Mmm...!

17:55.875 --> 17:57.844
Something smells delicious!

17:57.877 --> 17:59.512
(laughs)

17:59.546 --> 18:01.814
Zoe, so glad you came.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.317
Yay. Me, too. So glad.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.186
Mmm!

18:08.488 --> 18:12.459
Magnolia?

18:12.492 --> 18:15.262
I promised your dad
I'd check on you before I left.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.564
You checked, I'm fine,
you can go now.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.301
Is there anything
I can do to help?

18:21.334 --> 18:23.303
Yes.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.705
Absolutely.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.508
You're the very first person
I want to confide in,

18:28.541 --> 18:30.343
since we know each other
so well.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.413
It's about a boy, right?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.848
A boy named... Lucas?

18:36.916 --> 18:38.885
How'd you know?

18:38.918 --> 18:41.288
Would you believe I'm psychic?

18:41.321 --> 18:43.456
Would you believe...

18:43.490 --> 18:46.293
you left your cell phone

18:46.326 --> 18:49.396
in the bathroom, and a text
came in while I was in there?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.498
I just saw the one, but...

18:51.531 --> 18:54.167
he sounds like a real jerk.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.274
If you say
there's more fish in the sea,

19:01.308 --> 19:02.809
I swear,
I'm going out the window.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.645
Is that him?

19:10.983 --> 19:14.554
Hmm, not much
to look at, is he?

19:14.587 --> 19:15.522
(laughs)

19:15.555 --> 19:16.923
(laughing)

19:27.300 --> 19:30.270
You know, I was just
trying to be a good guy.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.604
But this isn't
the Middle Ages,

19:31.638 --> 19:32.939
and I don't need
your blessing

19:32.972 --> 19:34.674
to date your ex-wife.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.709
For all you know, she
might not even care,

19:36.743 --> 19:39.412
so I might just take my chances
and ask her out anyway.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.813
Yeah, that'd be a mistake.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.982
See, I may not be married
to Tansy anymore, George,

19:43.015 --> 19:44.617
but I still care about her.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.852
And brother, I know you.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.720
What's that supposed to mean?

19:47.754 --> 19:50.323
It means I know y'all aren't
right for each other.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.292
Okay, you and Tansy--
you're not even

19:52.325 --> 19:53.826
from the same planet, Tucker.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.562
Gentlemen, we have a Code Red.

19:55.595 --> 19:56.829
What's that?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.398
I did a head count,

19:58.431 --> 19:59.332
and one of the Eagle Rangers
is missing.

19:59.366 --> 19:59.999
Which one?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.834
Yours, Kinsella-- Connor.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.703
Now, you two get out there
and find him right now!

20:03.736 --> 20:04.937
Come on!

20:04.971 --> 20:06.439
Big surprise.
Shut up!

20:06.473 --> 20:07.874
Oh.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.578
Mmm.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.814
Lavon, this
dinner is perfect!

20:14.847 --> 20:16.316
Mmm!

20:16.349 --> 20:17.984
You all right?

20:18.017 --> 20:19.586
You're awful quiet.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.688
He, uh, gets
like that sometimes.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.357
When he grills.
The propane.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.358
Hmm.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.327
So, uh,

20:27.360 --> 20:28.861
how was your day?
Oh, you know,

20:28.895 --> 20:30.530
uneventful.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.401
Your manicure went... smoothly?

20:34.434 --> 20:37.570
It... did.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.738
We should talk more
about the steak.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.872
Want to know why?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.474
'Cause that flank is bank.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.476
That's how the kids say good.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.546
'Cause your nail polish-- it
doesn't look particularly new.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.415
As a matter of fact,

20:48.448 --> 20:49.749
it looks just like
the same old nail polish

20:49.782 --> 20:50.750
you had on this morning.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.352
What do you think, Zoe?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.354
I-I didn't notice.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.022
You're asking me a lot of
questions about my nail polish.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.491
Well, you know,
as-as, uh, mayor,

20:58.525 --> 21:01.361
I should know if our local salon
is underperforming.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.796
Well, seems like it's...

21:03.830 --> 21:05.632
a little more than that.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.866
Lavon, if you got

21:06.899 --> 21:08.701
something to ask me...

21:08.735 --> 21:09.936
ask me.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.638
Okay, fine.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.440
This afternoon,

21:13.473 --> 21:15.642
when you said you were
getting a manicure,

21:15.675 --> 21:18.077
were you actually meeting
with a headhunter about a job

21:18.110 --> 21:19.679
out of town?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.950
You are un... believable.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.085
You spied on me?
No...

21:26.118 --> 21:27.454
No.
Oh, please...

21:27.487 --> 21:29.055
Lavon Hayes does not spy.
Course not.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.957
Right, right, right.
He had his best friend

21:30.990 --> 21:32.992
and tenant do it for him.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.462
Oh, no, I don't spy;
I'm a doctor-- I treat,

21:35.495 --> 21:37.964
I heal...
Well, d-don't turn
this around, now,

21:37.997 --> 21:40.667
'cause you're the one planning
to take a job you weren't
actually gonna tell me about.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.934
I mend.
You want to know why
I didn't tell you?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.102
Because I wasn't
gonna take the job,

21:43.135 --> 21:44.637
and I didn't want
to worry you.

21:44.671 --> 21:45.738
The board wanted
to meet with me

21:45.772 --> 21:46.973
in Dallas, and I said no.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.675
I'm supposed
to believe that.
Yes.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.443
Yes, shocking, because
I was being honest

21:50.477 --> 21:52.545
when I said I had every
intention of staying here,

21:52.579 --> 21:54.814
Lavon, and seeing if you
and I had something...

21:54.847 --> 21:56.983
Who's ready for dessert?
And you know what,
I'm being honest now

21:57.016 --> 22:00.787
when I say you're the same
jackass as you were when
you left for college.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.689
Hey, Ruby, baby...
No, you know what?
Don't bother.

22:02.722 --> 22:03.956
I just changed my mind.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.124
I think I will interview
for that job.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.660
Thank you, Lavon,
for your trust in me.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.830
And thank you, Zoe, for
making a difficult decision

22:10.863 --> 22:11.931
a lot easier.
Enjoy your dinner.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.445
I can't believe I bought
into your shenanigans.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.046
You know what, sometimes
"shenanigans" is just

22:27.079 --> 22:28.748
another word for
doing what's necessary.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.450
We screwed up a perfectly
happy relationship.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.752
Now Ruby is leaving,
and she won't even
talk to Lavon,

22:32.785 --> 22:34.053
and we have to fix this.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.988
Okay, that is too many
words in a row.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.391
Just take a breath, Zoe.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.059
You are looking at this
all the wrong way.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.028
I mean, even if Lavon
and Ruby do split up,

22:42.061 --> 22:44.030
we knew that she was gonna
break his heart eventually,

22:44.063 --> 22:45.865
so maybe this is for
the best, and why not

22:45.898 --> 22:48.601
just let it happen?
How can you say that?

22:48.635 --> 22:51.904
Sometimes I open my mouth and
the truth, it just comes out.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.907
The truth? What part of
what you just said is the...

22:57.677 --> 22:59.479
Oh, my God, Lemon,

22:59.512 --> 23:01.481
this is about you.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.483
You still have
feelings for Lavon.

23:03.516 --> 23:04.717
Deny it.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.785
Please deny it.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.890
It may be possible that I...
still have feelings for Lavon.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.125
How could I be so gullible?
I'm from New York.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.628
Yes, please,
remind me again.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.964
I screwed over my best friend,
torpedoed his relationship.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.165
We can't do this.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.633
I am not doing anything.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.569
I am simply letting
nature take its course.

23:22.602 --> 23:23.870
No, you are not.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.738
You are like one of
those super villains,

23:25.772 --> 23:27.774
making nature do what
you want it to do.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.609
Lemon, you had your
chance with Lavon.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.444
You broke his heart.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.613
Now, we have to make this right;
he deserves to be happy.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.648
You know what?

23:35.682 --> 23:38.417
So do I.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.822
(sighs)

23:46.526 --> 23:48.795
Hey... Hey, you want to
slow down a little bit?

23:48.828 --> 23:50.897
You having a hard time
keeping up, Tucker?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.164
No, but there
are protocols

23:52.198 --> 23:54.233
that we need to be
following here, all right?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.935
We need to alert Baldwin
County Search and Rescue,

23:55.968 --> 23:57.103
have them put
a team in place.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.738
I know I'm no
lifelong Eagle Ranger,

23:58.771 --> 24:00.773
but before we call in
the Air Force or whatever,

24:00.807 --> 24:01.841
maybe we should
just continue

24:01.874 --> 24:04.043
following the, uh, trail
of frosted animal cookies.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.917
I guess we could try that first.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.820
(phone ringing)
Hello?

24:13.853 --> 24:15.522
ZOE:
Hey. It's me.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.824
Look, I am so sorry to bug you,
but I kind of have

24:17.857 --> 24:19.592
an emergency here,
and I could use some advice.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.661
Yeah, George and I have
a bit of an issue, too.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.195
We're trying to
track down a kid.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.031
Wait, George is with you?
Hey, could you put him on?

24:25.064 --> 24:25.998
He'll know what to do.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.002
Tucker, it's for you.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.505
Well, put money on it--
15 years from now,

24:32.539 --> 24:34.173
you will not remember
that boy's name.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.274
(laughs)

24:35.307 --> 24:37.577
Well, well, well.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.579
Hey, Brick.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.113
Now, don't be alarmed,
but we've cleaned

24:41.147 --> 24:42.849
all the pie
out of your freezer.

24:42.882 --> 24:43.783
(Brick laughs)

24:43.816 --> 24:45.718
Well, you know, let me clean up.

24:45.752 --> 24:46.986
I'll join you.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.589
I'm going to bed, but,
Daddy, can I talk to you?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.727
I thought about it,
and...

24:54.761 --> 24:56.763
if you want to ask Emily

24:56.796 --> 24:59.599
to... you know...

24:59.632 --> 25:02.935
Well, I probably won't go
looking for circuses to join.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.278
Well, I mean... I think
you just got to be honest.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.947
You know, lay it on the line.
I don't think

25:14.981 --> 25:17.016
you really have
much of a choice.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.018
Yep, all right.
Well, good... good luck.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.186
Okay.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.988
(clears throat)

25:23.990 --> 25:26.025
What?
I want to know

25:26.058 --> 25:29.161
why you're never gonna
get my permission to date
Tansy, George? This.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.197
This is the reason
right here.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.633
'Cause I took
a phone call in the woods?

25:33.666 --> 25:36.736
Because you're never
gonna end up with Tansy,
or anyone like her, okay?

25:36.769 --> 25:38.337
She's like a placeholder
to you, George.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.172
She's the '64 Mustang
that you rent

25:40.206 --> 25:42.642
before you settle down
and buy the sedan.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.644
Can we just calm down
so we can talk about
this rationally, Wade?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.813
I'm gonna tell you exactly
how it's gonna happen.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.180
You're gonna take Tansy
out on a few dates,

25:48.214 --> 25:49.649
you're gonna have
a grand old time,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.217
and then you're gonna
leave her in the dust

25:51.250 --> 25:53.185
when you move on to
the girl you think

25:53.219 --> 25:55.054
you're supposed to be
with-- Zoe Hart.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.190
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

25:58.224 --> 26:01.160
Wade, you have no idea
what you're talking about.
Oh. Oh, oh,

26:01.193 --> 26:02.995
I know exactly what I'm
talking about, brother.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.797
Hey...

26:04.831 --> 26:07.066
you're not even
listening to me.
Found our runner.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.771
I understand you like cookies.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.172
ZOE:
 This whole situation

26:13.205 --> 26:14.941
is my fault,

26:14.974 --> 26:16.743
and I'm sorry.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.745
Zoe, look, I...
I got in Lavon's head.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.146
I planted doubt.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.682
But I thought it was
the right thing to do.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.618
Please... please give Lavon
a second chance.

26:25.652 --> 26:28.154
I mean, he thinks
the world of you,

26:28.187 --> 26:29.889
and he's the best judge
of character I know.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.090
Zoe, I thought
about it,

26:31.123 --> 26:34.326
and... truth is,
you did me a favor.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.695
I don't understand.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.963
(knocking on door)

26:36.996 --> 26:39.198
RUBY:
 I didn't come back to BlueBell

26:39.231 --> 26:41.333
to get involved
 with an old boyfriend.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.335
This was supposed to be
 a rest stop,

26:43.369 --> 26:45.805
a place for me to figure out
 my next move.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.707
That was the plan.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.841
Sometimes plans change.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.242
LEMON:
 I heard...

26:50.276 --> 26:51.243
what happened with Ruby.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.179
So...

26:53.212 --> 26:55.081
I made you a Bundt cake.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.083
The kind you like,
with the chocolate filling.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.186
I appreciate it.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.388
I'd invite you in, but, uh...

27:02.421 --> 27:04.691
I'm not very good
company right now.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.358
I understand.
I just...

27:06.392 --> 27:09.628
I wanted to let you know
that I was thinking of you.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.833
ZOE:
 What about Lavon?

27:13.866 --> 27:17.136
Lavon's a really good guy.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.205
Yeah.
But I can't derail

27:19.238 --> 27:21.908
my life for a murky
future in a small town.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.377
RUBY:
 Even with a good guy.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.379
This one really hurt, huh?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.883
It kind of took
me by surprise.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.319
I didn't realize how...

27:33.352 --> 27:36.322
hard I'd fallen for Ruby.

27:36.355 --> 27:39.191
And I think I lost her.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.860
ZOE:
 You know, don't think

27:40.893 --> 27:41.894
about the future.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.930
Just take it one day at a time.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.297
I'm not like you, Zoe.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.834
I'm not comfortable
living in the unknown.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.369
I'm going to the interview.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.238
I owe it to myself.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.108
I'm sorry.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.945
I haven't taken a leap
like this since...

28:01.080 --> 28:04.984
I'm sorry about that, too.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.319
Took me a long time
to get over you.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.956
I finally found someone
that makes me happy,

28:09.989 --> 28:11.323
and now...

28:11.357 --> 28:14.026
I almost wish she never
came back to town.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.031
'Cause now I know
what I'm gonna miss.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.836
Thank you for the cake.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.339
Good night.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.845
(sighs)

28:36.215 --> 28:36.983
(sighs heavily)

28:38.250 --> 28:40.086
(clears throat)

28:40.119 --> 28:42.021
(phone ringing)

28:45.858 --> 28:47.326
Lemon?

28:47.359 --> 28:48.527
Listen, you were right
about Lavon.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.062
We have to fix this.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.831
I don't think it's fixable.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.365
Do you know
who you're talking to?

28:53.399 --> 28:55.367
This is Lemon Breeland.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.369
I have a plan.
Meet me in five minutes.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.737
(sighs)

29:05.878 --> 29:08.180
Nah, nah,
I don't want any part of this.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.115
But you don't even
know the plan.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.983
Just hear us out and
you can reject it later.

29:11.017 --> 29:11.784
Start before he
says no again.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.119
Okay, in one hour,

29:13.152 --> 29:15.221
headhunter Tim is sending a limo
to pick Ruby up

29:15.254 --> 29:16.522
to bring her to the airport.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.456
But before it gets to her,

29:17.489 --> 29:19.091
the limo will be detained
by Sheriff Bill.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.392
At which point,
a second limo

29:20.426 --> 29:22.261
will arrive in front
of the Jeffries' house.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.462
And guess who's driving
that limo.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.831
You.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.366
And that's the plan?

29:27.399 --> 29:28.367
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.836
You drive Ruby
to the airport,

29:29.869 --> 29:31.137
you have 30 minutes of
her undivided attention

29:31.170 --> 29:32.905
where you can lay out your case.

29:32.939 --> 29:36.208
One problem:
I don't have a case to lay out.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.010
Yes, you do.
You want her to stay.

29:38.044 --> 29:38.945
That's never gonna happen.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.479
She said as much, right?

29:40.512 --> 29:41.914
A murky future.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.315
Life of the unknown.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.284
Ruby's just killing time with me

29:45.317 --> 29:47.987
till something better
comes along.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.355
Something better
just came, so...

29:49.388 --> 29:50.256
No!

29:52.024 --> 29:53.492
You are wrong.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.862
All great relationships
start with a murky future.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.329
And all the perfect
relationships

29:57.363 --> 29:58.464
where people think they're
going to be together forever,

29:58.497 --> 29:59.866
they explode.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.034
Romeo and Juliet? Dead.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.269
Antony and Cleopatra?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.270
Dead.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.072
Kristen and Rob?
Splitsville.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.007
No one knows what's
gonna happen.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.341
The future is a mystery.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.242
The only relationships
guaranteed to fail

30:10.276 --> 30:11.277
are the ones we don't chase.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.547
Rob and Kristen
are back together,

30:15.581 --> 30:16.983
but her point still applies.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.150
Shh.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.889
Look, I can out-wait you.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.224
I once spent five days
in a tree.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.160
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to talk.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.029
You don't even
know why I'm here.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.597
Is this 'cause
I didn't want to hear

30:31.630 --> 30:32.831
your stinkin'
Jay Leno impression?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.936
I'm sorry, okay?

30:36.969 --> 30:41.073
I've been, uh, preoccupied.

30:41.107 --> 30:43.275
Why are you here?

30:43.309 --> 30:45.111
The Wilderness
Run is tomorrow.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.979
I thought everybody loves
the Wilderness Run.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.480
Not everyone.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.616
Not the kid who gets
laughed at every year.

30:50.649 --> 30:54.220
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm not really an athlete,

30:54.253 --> 30:56.122
I'm kind of heavy,
I'm a slow runner...

30:57.924 --> 30:59.625
Hey, if you want
to disagree...

30:59.658 --> 31:01.360
I don't.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.095
You're right.

31:03.129 --> 31:08.100
You are not the, uh, traditional
Eagle Ranger type.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.501
Wow, you really
are bad at this.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.669
(chuckles)

31:10.702 --> 31:13.105
Yeah.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.107
Maybe that's 'cause
I was only an Eagle Ranger

31:15.141 --> 31:16.976
for all of four hours myself.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.677
You got kicked out?
No.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.379
No, sir.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.248
I quit.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.416
Showed up that first day,
took a look around

31:24.450 --> 31:28.620
at the other kids and I decided,
eh, wasn't for me.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.656
They thought they
were all better than me--

31:30.689 --> 31:34.426
faster, stronger, smarter.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.396
So, I bailed.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.265
Big mistake.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.333
Why?

31:41.367 --> 31:44.270
'Cause sometimes...

31:44.303 --> 31:46.138
sometimes the things
you tell yourself

31:46.172 --> 31:49.275
when you're ten years old,
they become kind of truth.

31:49.308 --> 31:53.012
So, here I am, 20 years later,

31:53.045 --> 31:57.016
I still believe I'm second-rate
to some of those guys.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.384
Even the ones
I'm still friends with.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.421
You can't grow up

32:02.454 --> 32:06.025
feeling like you're not as good
as the people around you.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.693
That's why
you got to participate

32:07.726 --> 32:09.028
in the Wilderness Run
tomorrow.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.262
Even though I can't run?

32:12.498 --> 32:14.566
Who says you gotta run?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.270
(both moaning softly)

32:21.340 --> 32:22.474
Fun night.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.210
Yeah. (chuckles)

32:24.243 --> 32:28.614
I almost hate to go back
to the real world tomorrow.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.984
Well, what if you didn't?

32:33.252 --> 32:35.121
I'm sorry?

32:35.154 --> 32:38.390
Emily...

32:38.424 --> 32:40.192
I think you
should move here.

32:40.226 --> 32:43.362
I mean, we wouldn't
have to say good-bye

32:43.395 --> 32:45.131
every other
Sunday night.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.133
No more Skyping.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.068
Be in the same zip code.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.636
I'm ready for that now.

32:50.669 --> 32:54.140
And now I think
my family is, too.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.609
Brick, I-I... like my life
the way it is right now.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.079
I just don't think
I'm ready for anything more.

33:00.112 --> 33:04.116
Emily, I have been
alone for 13 years.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.285
And I was fine with that...

33:06.318 --> 33:08.454
until I met you.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.290
And now, I just can't
imagine it any other way.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.758
Is that too quick? Maybe.

33:12.791 --> 33:17.429
But when you know,
you just know.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.365
Now, come on, let's not
waste any more time.

33:19.398 --> 33:20.799
Let's just jump
on this train,

33:20.832 --> 33:23.001
and see where it takes us.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.019
You have got to be kidding me.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.457
I've never been more serious.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.193
Despite the hat.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.527
Can I take your bag?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.196
There's no other limo coming
tonight, is there?

33:50.229 --> 33:51.830
No.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.532
Lavon, I'm going to Dallas.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.134
I'm interviewing for that job.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.436
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.171
Even with that hat.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.175
I understand.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.811
Just give me from here
to the airport to uh...

34:05.844 --> 34:07.279
make my case.

34:07.313 --> 34:08.780
Your case?

34:08.813 --> 34:10.815
Yeah.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.685
Starts with Romeo and Juliet

34:13.719 --> 34:16.554
and, uh, ends with a...

34:16.588 --> 34:20.759
mind-blowing and eloquent speech
from your driver.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.737
(exhales)

34:39.277 --> 34:40.712
You sure we did
the right thing?
Yes.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.313
Just checking.

34:48.853 --> 34:52.324
Eagle Rangers, line it up--
Wilderness Run's about to begin.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.193
Hey, Wade, hey.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.594
Where's Connor? He's supposed
to participate in this.

34:55.627 --> 34:56.728
Oh, he's gonna participate.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.198
He just, uh, won't be running.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.800
We had something
else in mind.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.602
Wh... (sighs)

35:03.635 --> 35:04.870
(mic feedback hums)

35:04.903 --> 35:07.273
Welcome to hell, little Rangers.

35:07.306 --> 35:11.377
Also known as the 25th
Annual Wilderness Run.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.844
When you hear the whistle,

35:12.878 --> 35:14.813
go out there and get some!

35:16.282 --> 35:18.450
All right,
you heard the man.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.719
On your marks,

35:20.752 --> 35:23.722
get set...
(whistle blows)

35:23.755 --> 35:26.692
Marcus "The Machine" Miller is
wearing his lucky purple socks.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.760
Miller is not far behind

35:28.794 --> 35:30.396
Darryl Braxton Hicks

35:30.429 --> 35:32.264
and he's wearing
no socks at all.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.899
Maybe that's why he's so fast.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.268
Oh, and down goes Hicks!

35:36.302 --> 35:37.769
If he were a horse,

35:37.803 --> 35:38.770
they'd have to shoot him.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.907
I left it all on the field.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.642
You know, I told her that, uh...

35:43.675 --> 35:45.811
epic love affairs only come
around once in a lifetime,

35:45.844 --> 35:48.280
but there's always
gonna be another job.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.782
Good.
Then what happened?

35:50.816 --> 35:52.918
And then she got on the plane
for Dallas.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.420
Haven't heard from her since.

35:54.453 --> 35:57.689
I keep checking
the phone, but...

35:57.723 --> 35:58.657
There you go.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.495
(clears throat)

36:03.529 --> 36:06.465
Mayor Hayes; Dr. Hart.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.799
Hey, Ruby,
I was just leaving.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.967
Catch up
with you later?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.502
Okay.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.313
(clears throat)

36:21.347 --> 36:22.548
So...

36:22.581 --> 36:23.849
did you have a good trip?

36:24.983 --> 36:27.319
I took the job.

36:27.353 --> 36:30.289
And right to the point.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.824
No dinner, no foreplay.
However...

36:32.858 --> 36:35.827
I told them I couldn't start
till the first of the year,

36:35.861 --> 36:37.629
which is a while
from now.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.430
You said that?

36:38.464 --> 36:39.931
Yeah.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.969
What do you think you
might do till then?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.937
I was...

36:45.971 --> 36:48.840
thinking I could spend
that time here... with you.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.544
See what we have together.
See if it works.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.614
And if it doesn't, you...
you take the job in Dallas.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.317
And if it does,

36:58.350 --> 37:00.018
you still take
the job in Dallas.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.454
(laughs) What kind
of a plan is that?

37:02.488 --> 37:03.555
Lavon...

37:03.589 --> 37:05.957
it's a work in progress.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.594
Something that we can
figure out together.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.296
I mean, I don't, I don't know

37:10.329 --> 37:11.463
what the future's
gonna look like,

37:11.497 --> 37:13.565
but I know what I want.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.334
I want a chance to have it all.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.803
You, job...

37:17.836 --> 37:19.237
the whole world.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.774
So, what you think?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.345
I'm in.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.679
Yeah?

37:27.713 --> 37:29.448
(both laugh)

37:29.481 --> 37:31.983
All right... yeah.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.662
Where's Emily?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.599
Oh, she... is gone.

37:47.633 --> 37:50.436
And I don't think we're gonna
be seeing much more of her.

37:51.903 --> 37:55.541
And after I was so nice
to her, too.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.008
(chuckles)

37:58.877 --> 38:00.346
I won't make that mistake again.

38:02.514 --> 38:06.017
Daddy...

38:06.051 --> 38:07.619
are you okay?

38:07.653 --> 38:10.589
I will be.

38:10.622 --> 38:14.993
You want to hear about
all the other fish in the sea?

38:15.026 --> 38:16.562
(laughs)

38:16.595 --> 38:17.596
Nobody wants to hear that.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.003
MAYFAIR:
All right, guys,

38:25.036 --> 38:26.738
five minutes,
then we're packing up,

38:26.772 --> 38:28.940
Five minutes, let's go.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.877
(whistling)

38:31.910 --> 38:33.845
(clears throat)

38:36.848 --> 38:38.784
GEORGE:
You did a good job
with that kid, man.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.419
Well... (wry laugh)

38:40.452 --> 38:42.120
guess my four hours
of being an Eagle Ranger

38:42.153 --> 38:43.455
weren't a total loss.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.055
(quiet chuckle)

38:46.057 --> 38:49.461
Hey, look, man, just so, uh, so
everything's out on the table,

38:49.495 --> 38:52.864
uh, I called Tansy,
left her a message.

38:52.898 --> 38:55.100
I kind of figured you would.

38:55.133 --> 38:58.136
Word of advice:
don't let her drive.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.638
(chuckles)

38:59.671 --> 39:02.474
Okay, I hear you
on that.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.010
But, uh, man, I want you
to know something, all right?

39:05.043 --> 39:07.713
I don't see Tansy the way
that you think that I do.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.649
I'm not saying I'm gonna
marry her or anything, but...

39:10.682 --> 39:12.751
I don't see her
as a placeholder.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.588
All right.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.724
Hey, appreciate it.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.893
And, uh, Wade, if, uh...

39:21.927 --> 39:25.030
if that's how you think
Zoe sees you,

39:25.063 --> 39:27.065
then you should
talk to her.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.501
Okay? Don't let it
drive you crazy.

39:31.637 --> 39:32.838
(quiet laugh)
What?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.973
Yeah, I know...
I've known for a while

39:35.006 --> 39:38.610
and I'm okay with it, well,
I'm... kind of okay with it.

39:40.612 --> 39:41.480
Just talk to her.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.616
Good luck.

39:44.650 --> 39:47.653
(sighs)

39:49.555 --> 39:50.922
(knocking on door)

39:55.894 --> 39:56.862
Hello.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.765
How was the wilderness?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.467
Uh... it was interesting.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.901
Yeah?

40:02.934 --> 40:06.004
I have had a couple
of interesting days myself.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.773
Do you want to come in?

40:07.806 --> 40:10.642
We can forget our
interesting days together.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.479
I-I was actually
hoping we, uh...

40:13.512 --> 40:15.180
we could talk.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.848
Talk? We don't talk.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.784
But...

40:18.817 --> 40:19.785
we could talk.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.053
What do you want
to talk about?

40:22.087 --> 40:26.658
Well, uh, a couple...
things actually.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.059
First...

40:28.093 --> 40:30.428
turns out,
George Tucker knows about us.

40:32.564 --> 40:33.799
He knows?

40:33.832 --> 40:36.535
Yeah, and, uh,
he doesn't care.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.170
Uh, he says he's
fine with it.

40:39.204 --> 40:42.040
Really? He is?

40:42.073 --> 40:45.176
Yeah.

40:45.210 --> 40:50.081
Well, that-that is cool.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.250
That is great,
you know, because...

40:52.283 --> 40:54.085
that's what I wanted

40:54.119 --> 40:58.590
and now we don't have
to worry about it.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.894
What is the second thing?

41:02.928 --> 41:05.463
Uh... (anxious laugh)

41:09.167 --> 41:11.069
There is no second thing.

41:11.102 --> 41:14.806
But you said you had a couple
of things to talk to me about.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.979
Guess I must've counted wrong.

41:23.048 --> 41:27.052
Look... I think I'm-I'm gonna
head back over to my place,

41:27.085 --> 41:28.954
take a shower, you know,

41:28.987 --> 41:31.156
wash the, uh, the woods off.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.291
Okay.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.826
Well, are you gonna
come over later?

41:34.860 --> 41:36.762
I don't think so.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.064
Got to be up early, so...

41:41.567 --> 41:43.201
All right.

41:45.637 --> 41:48.306
Well, have a good night.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.275
Yeah... (quiet laugh)

41:50.308 --> 41:52.510
You too.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.987
