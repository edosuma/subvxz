00:13.513 --> 00:16.266
[Alexa] My parents were taking Lucas
on a weekend college visit,

00:16.349 --> 00:19.310
which meant I would have
the entire house to myself,

00:19.394 --> 00:21.730
which meant no rules, no parents...

00:21.813 --> 00:23.690
...no curfews, no naps.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.192
No doing anything bad.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.696
I thought I could sneak that in there.

00:31.239 --> 00:35.827
No, this weekend is gonna be
out of control at Casa Fundoza!

00:35.910 --> 00:37.871
No, it's not!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.540
Because Casa Fundoza is cloza.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.500
You're staying next door.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.545
Come on, Mom. You can trust us.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.380
Oh, sweetheart, you know,

00:47.464 --> 00:50.717
you can tell your lies to Jennifer
for the next 24 hours.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.512
[Dave humming tune]

00:55.555 --> 00:59.934
[yells] Lucas, we have to be
at the airport at 17:00 hours!

01:00.018 --> 01:02.187
-Can you just say five o'clock?
-You know I can't.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.482
-Dad, you're in a good mood.
-Why wouldn't I be?

01:05.565 --> 01:08.318
We are going
to the United States Air Force Academy,

01:08.401 --> 01:12.030
where Lucas will soon spend the happiest
days of his life, just like I did.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.284
Except for the day I married your mom.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.914
And the days my kids were born, and...

01:22.082 --> 01:23.208
No, that's it.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.336
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, Jen.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.588
Did you get Alexa's list of reminders
I emailed you?

01:28.671 --> 01:32.550
-I know you're swamped with studying.
-I've got everything under control.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.594
Just go and enjoy your anniversary trip.

01:34.969 --> 01:35.970
It's a college trip.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.348
Oh, thank God.
I don't have to buy you a present.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.060
Don't worry. I am on top of this.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.020
Wow. Uh...

01:44.103 --> 01:47.941
"Healthy food, math tutor,
not going out at night."

01:48.024 --> 01:49.984
What? "Not going out at night"?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.236
Come on, it's one night,

01:51.319 --> 01:53.947
and Jennifer doesn't need to be worried
about where you are.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.032
She's gonna be studying
really, really hard

01:56.116 --> 01:58.034
if she has a prayer
of passing these classes.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.119
Lori!

01:59.202 --> 02:01.412
No, no. That's exactly what I told her.

02:06.042 --> 02:09.629
OK, Mendoza.
Ready for inspection? Ten-hut!

02:11.548 --> 02:13.550
Definitely Academy material.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.511
I understand
your dad was one of our finest.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.804
So he tells me, sir!

02:18.596 --> 02:19.806
At ease, Mendoza.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.142
Hey, w-where's your hoodie?

02:22.225 --> 02:24.853
Yeah, don't you want
to be twinsies with Dad?

02:24.936 --> 02:26.271
Yeah, don't you?

02:27.021 --> 02:30.483
It's in my bag. I'm keeping it fresh
for when I meet the colonel.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.069
-Kissing up to authority.
-Mm-hm.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.488
-I've taught you well. Ha-ha!
-Mm-hm.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.241
-[horn toots outside]
-All right. Well, have a good weekend.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.119
Honey, don't do anything
that I know you're thinking about doing.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.038
-Be good for Jennifer, all right?
-OK.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.582
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.376
Have fun!

02:48.459 --> 02:50.795
I got this.
Don't you give it a second thought.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.256
[Jennifer chuckles]

02:55.592 --> 02:57.010
[TV blares]

02:58.428 --> 03:01.723
Ha-ha! I didn't forget you guys. Come on.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.980
Hey, hold up.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.108
I'm inviting Hannah and Reagan
to sleep over tonight.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.735
Oh, uh, my mom has to study.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.862
I didn't say your house.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.781
It's started, hasn't it?

Uh... OK, I'll go as far as the tree,
but that is it.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.617
[Katie grunts]

04:03.910 --> 04:06.955
OK, but I am definitely not
going past here.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.415
[groans]

04:13.586 --> 04:17.548
All right, this is where I draw the line.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.635
OK, I am stepping over the line,

04:20.718 --> 04:23.137
but that does not mean
that the line is not there.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.766
Wait. OK, what are we doing?

04:26.849 --> 04:28.518
Whatever we want.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.937
For the last six months,
all I've had is rules.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.565
So tonight we're going to break out
the Ouija board, play truth or dare,

04:34.649 --> 04:37.986
do makeovers and stay up all night
and watch the sun come up.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.405
Come on, I really need this.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.115
And this.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.244
-Are you in?
-OK.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.454
[mumbles] I'm in.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.001
What about when Dylan
comes over for tutoring?

04:53.084 --> 04:54.210
I canceled it.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.712
Really?

04:55.795 --> 04:59.674
Oh, because you've been avoiding him
since you said no to the dance?

04:59.757 --> 05:04.429
No. Because tonight is girls' night,
and Dylan didn't make the cut.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.140
Besides, you, me, Hannah and Reagan
are all going together.

05:07.724 --> 05:11.769
Oh, yeah! OK, when they come over, we
can talk about what we're going to wear.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.146
Whose house we're gonna meet at.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.231
Practice our moves.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.652
OK, not that one.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.281
Wait. What do we do tonight
if my mom looks for us?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.490
[Jack] Not a problem.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.910
Alexa gave me a candy bar
to stand guard by your room,

05:27.994 --> 05:29.370
so when Mom calls for you...

05:30.455 --> 05:32.165
I can let you know. Copy that?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
Copy that.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.295
[boy over walkie-talkie] Jack?
I can't play now. My grandma's here.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.338
Copy that, Kyle.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.757
These are my friend Kyle's.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.259
Do not break them.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.221
-OK, Jack, back to your post.
-Copy that!

05:49.474 --> 05:51.142
Well, that's not gonna get annoying.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.228
[stammers] When did you get Jack on board?

05:54.312 --> 05:57.482
Last night. I wasn't gonna let anything
get in the way of tonight.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.817
I have backup plans for my backup plans.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.653
Girls' night starts now!

06:02.737 --> 06:05.031
Oh, yeah! And one... Are you ready?

06:05.114 --> 06:05.948
And three!

06:06.032 --> 06:07.825
And four! And five!

[Jack] Dylan's here.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.245
What? No, I canceled!

06:11.329 --> 06:13.247
OK, but there's a guy with glasses

06:13.331 --> 06:15.458
and a math book
heading to Katie's room with Mom.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.757

-No, I did.

-So, you didn't read my text?
-No, I did.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.065
Just your mom told me to ignore it
if you canceled this, so...

06:39.148 --> 06:41.234
Well, tonight's not really a good night.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.902
She said to ignore that, too.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.156
[Katie clears throat]

06:47.240 --> 06:51.661
Well, I love an awkward silence
as much as anybody...

06:51.744 --> 06:53.663
but... I've got to...

06:54.247 --> 06:55.081
Yeah.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.212
-So, do you want to talk about it?
-Algebra?

07:02.421 --> 07:03.840
Yeah, sure.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.051
So, last week we were working
on quadratic equations,

07:07.135 --> 07:08.636
and this week we're...

07:08.719 --> 07:10.596
climbing out the window.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.809
[TV blares]

07:17.353 --> 07:20.064
OK, so, now that I know how to break in
to both of your houses...

07:20.857 --> 07:22.024
are we going to do this?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.527
I just didn't want to deal with this
this weekend.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.195
I mean algebra.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.614
Algebra can be confusing.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.992
I mean, not for me.
I know how I feel about algebra.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.535
Obviously, you struggle with it.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.079

[knocking at door]

07:45.047 --> 07:47.216
-Secret sleepover!
-Hey, guys.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.384
Oh, hey, Dylan!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.760
We haven't seen you since--

07:49.844 --> 07:50.928
Ow!

07:51.012 --> 07:52.805
...since Alexa said no to you in--

07:52.889 --> 07:53.973
Ow!

07:54.056 --> 07:55.975
...in detention in front of everybody.

07:57.059 --> 07:57.894
Yeah.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.188
What do you want, Reagan?
I was trying to talk to Dylan.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.439
And you did.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.486
Wow. There are a lot of people here.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.198
You're not letting them play
with the walkie-talkies, are you?

08:11.199 --> 08:13.826
-No. What's up?
-Dylan forgot his cell phone.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.828
He got a text from somebody named Cyndi.

08:15.912 --> 08:16.913
What?

08:16.996 --> 08:20.750
I-I mean, you...
you shouldn't read people's texts.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.005
"Meet you at Wired at eight."

08:26.088 --> 08:27.590
Oh, plus two winky faces.

-Did you read my texts?

08:35.806 --> 08:36.974
-So you did.
-You did.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.059
-What?
-What?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.478
I'm going.

08:40.561 --> 08:41.729

08:59.038 --> 09:00.122
Not a bad flight.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.542
I get applause on my landings, but still,

09:02.625 --> 09:03.834
not a bad flight.

-Oh, you're a pilot?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.205
Why didn't you say so?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.332
Pilots don't have to wait.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.587
We'll get you your very own plane
for you and your whole pilot family.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.047
I don't have any updates.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
Uh... She has no info yet,

09:55.678 --> 09:57.888
but as soon as she does,
I will be the first to--

and is delayed three hours.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.811
It's engine problems. Now I can tell you.

10:05.187 --> 10:07.189
Three hours?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.817
Oh. Three hours?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.611
I can get some gossip magazines,

10:11.694 --> 10:14.363
hit the day spa,
do a little Christmas shopping.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.035

10:19.619 --> 10:20.453
See ya!

10:24.123 --> 10:27.418
Hey, this gives us time
to go over the Academy questionnaire.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.339
Is the first question still,
"Why do you want to fly?"

10:31.422 --> 10:33.633
Yeah. That's a big one.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.426
I know, right?

10:35.509 --> 10:38.763
I mean, how do you put your life's purpose
in 300 words or less?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.766
I liked your answer when you were five.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.017
Remember?

10:43.768 --> 10:44.852
Say it.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.771
Say it! Say what you said.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.814
I want to be just like my dad.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.652
And now I'm tearing up again.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.364
Good, good.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.033
OK, now... now highlight with triangles.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.202
Dinner is served.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.745
Nachos and nuggets.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.830
Ooh, yum!

11:04.914 --> 11:07.333
Hey, what are these red things
on the nachos?

11:07.416 --> 11:08.501
-Starbursts.
-Hm.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.297
I told you there are no rules tonight.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.216
So...

11:15.883 --> 11:19.762
uh do you guys send uh winky faces
in your texts?

11:19.845 --> 11:22.181
I mean, what kind of a person
sends a winky face?

11:22.681 --> 11:26.936
I know some people who do, but only
when they really like someone. Why?

11:27.478 --> 11:30.064
Just having fun, asking questions.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.315
Questions are fun.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.443
[Hannah] Let me see!

11:35.277 --> 11:36.529
I love it!

11:38.406 --> 11:40.324
-Hey, let's play truth or dare.
-Mm, yeah!

11:40.866 --> 11:42.243
All right. Um...

11:43.077 --> 11:44.120
Katie, truth or dare?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.831
Uh... Truth. Dare.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.249
Truth. Dare.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.000
Truth.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.962
-Do you like Ryan?
-Yeah.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.797
Ooh!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.424
As a friend.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.550
Boo!

11:58.008 --> 12:00.803
You know, I heard he's gonna ask you
to the Winter Formal.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.388
[Hannah and Reagan] Ooh!

12:02.471 --> 12:03.806
OK, OK, OK, OK!

12:03.889 --> 12:05.558
Uh... Alexa, truth or dare?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.518
-Uh... Truth. Go.
-Do you like Dylan?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.104
That's easy.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.730
No.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.024
That's why you won't go
to Winter Formal with him?

12:14.108 --> 12:16.318
Look, he only asked me
because he felt sorry for me.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.655
Now, why are we talking about Dylan?
This is girls' night.

12:19.738 --> 12:23.826
OK, but I'm getting someone to admit
they like someone before the sun comes up.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.828
Dylan likes Cyndi.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.081
What? Jack, you don't know
what you're talking about.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.291
Yes, I do.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.794
I saw the text.
He's meeting Cyndi at Wired at eight.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.962
Who's Cyndi?

12:35.045 --> 12:37.298
Oh, do you think it's Cyndi Greenburg?

12:37.381 --> 12:39.258
She's a second-year senior.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.095
-Let's go to Wired to find out who she is.
-Let's!

12:43.179 --> 12:45.139
I'm not gonna spy on Dylan.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.349
Yeah. Yeah, she's not gonna spy on Dylan.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.603
If you guys keep bugging me
about it, let's just go to Wired.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.645
Yes!

12:51.729 --> 12:52.855
Let's go!

12:54.315 --> 12:57.234
-I'll blend your make-up on the way.
-You mean it gets better?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.865
All right, Jack, we need you to make sure
your mom doesn't go in Katie's room

13:02.948 --> 13:03.949
while we go to Wired.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.117
Easy.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.660
I'll throw myself down the stairs

13:06.744 --> 13:09.413
and she'll have to take me
to the emergency room!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.333
Something like that.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.084
But nothing like that.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.129
Copy that.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.012
He's in the corner.
He obviously wants some privacy.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.765
And there's two cups.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.893
Hey, Barry.
Have you served anyone named Cyndi?

13:30.976 --> 13:34.146
And did it end with an "I" or a "Y"?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.856
Oh, yeah, I remember.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.650
It ended with an I... don't care.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.947
Oh, my gosh! Dylan sees us.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.241
He's still seeing us.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.243
-He's still--
-All right, Katie!

13:49.745 --> 13:50.746
Are you stalking me?

13:50.829 --> 13:53.165
You wish! Where's Winky-Winky?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.125
-Why do you care?
-I don't. Why do you care?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.169
-What?
-What?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.004
[door opens]

13:59.088 --> 14:01.215
Oh, hey, Cyndi.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.218
This is Alexa.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.345
She is also one of my students.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.723
Dylan is helping me
with my accounting class.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.517
-Mm-hm.
-[Cyndi chuckles]

14:11.600 --> 14:12.851
He's a sweetheart.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.938
Oh, Cyndi.
I wish all my students felt that way.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.359
Nice... Nice to meet you...

14:21.110 --> 14:22.278
Cyndi.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.781
OK, we should go right now, please.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.744
[Katie] Oh, no! My mom! Hide!

14:38.210 --> 14:39.295
Jack, what the heck?

14:39.378 --> 14:43.549
I know! I got her to go out for ice cream,
but then she had to get coffee.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.428
-I'll think of something.
-OK.

14:48.012 --> 14:48.846
For here or to go?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.515
I know I said this at the ice cream place,

14:51.599 --> 14:53.517
but I deserve a study break.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.602
I'll have it here.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.065
OK, we just have to wait her out
and we're all good.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.984
[cell phone ringing]

15:04.194 --> 15:06.697
-Oh, no! Now it's my mom!
-OK. Uh...

15:07.072 --> 15:08.782
-Hold the phone close to your face.
-OK.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.787
Hi, Mom! How's it going?

15:13.871 --> 15:17.374
Well, our flight's delayed. How are you?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.628
I'm great.
You know, just having a nice, quiet night.

15:20.711 --> 15:24.214
[Barry] Espresso for Max,
soy latte for Jill.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.634
Are you at Wired?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.677
-Wired?
-Hey, I got it.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.972
Yes. Yes, Lori.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.891
We're at Wired with my mom.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.394
Oh, let me say hi!

15:37.478 --> 15:39.396
Yeah, that's what everyone says.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.815
You know, think of something else
and call back. Bye!

15:43.776 --> 15:44.777
Nice.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.362
Attention, everyone!

15:46.987 --> 15:48.113
Um...

15:48.197 --> 15:49.907
I'm running for mayor!

15:51.033 --> 15:52.034
Jack, what are you doing?

15:52.576 --> 15:53.786
Run!

15:53.869 --> 15:55.037
Run!

15:55.120 --> 15:56.747
Running for mayor!

15:59.917 --> 16:01.543
Eh, I changed my mind.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.464
This is why we don't go out.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.720
There you are.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.765
Hey, let's uh... let's prep for your
interview with Colonel McIntyre.

16:14.848 --> 16:15.891
Sure, sure.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.727
-I'll be the colonel.
-Mm-hm.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.064
Here are the kinds of questions
you can expect.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.401
Are you saying that,
or is the colonel saying that?

16:26.777 --> 16:27.611
That's me.

16:27.695 --> 16:31.156
Hm. OK. But in my defense,
the colonel looks a lot like you.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.951
Come on, Lucas.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.412
Now I'm the colonel.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.541
[as Colonel McIntyre]
Tell me, son, why do you want to serve?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.251
Is that what he sounds like?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.460
Dead on.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.379
Focus.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.885
So, then, young man, what do you have
to offer the Air Force Academy?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.055
Half a Cinnabon.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.559
Lucas, are you gonna take this seriously?

16:59.268 --> 17:02.730
Don't you realize
this is the opportunity of a lifetime?

17:02.813 --> 17:05.232
I know. You keep telling me that.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.942
Yeah, but it's not getting through.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.529
I-I've got to wash my hands.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.910
Look, Dad! A pilot!

17:18.412 --> 17:20.247
Hi. What's your name, son?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.255
Locked!

17:28.338 --> 17:29.339
[Katie] OK.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.008
Oh, locked!

17:31.091 --> 17:33.302
-[car approaching]
-Oh, that's my mom's car!

17:33.385 --> 17:34.511
What do we do?

17:34.595 --> 17:36.263
Climb up the tree! Give me a boost!

17:37.014 --> 17:38.390
[Katie] I got it, I got it.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.933
[Alexa] One, two, three...

17:40.017 --> 17:41.226
-Quick, split up.
-OK.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.936
[all grunting]

17:43.020 --> 17:44.730
Wait! No, no! Other way! Other way!

17:44.813 --> 17:45.981
[Katie] Oh, oh, oh!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.858
[all grunting]

17:47.941 --> 17:49.610
OK, OK, OK.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.278
These things are really pretty.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.158
[both panting]

17:57.785 --> 17:59.453
-Hey, Mom!
-Study break!

18:00.746 --> 18:02.039
How did we beat her here?

18:03.082 --> 18:03.957
Hi.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.126
Sorry we took so long.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.170
Jack was sure I had a flat tire,

18:08.253 --> 18:10.339
and then he was sure I took a wrong turn,

18:10.422 --> 18:12.508
then he ran around the yard
for ten minutes.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.927
[mouths] Nice.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.387
Good night, Jack.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.311
I'm exhausted from all that studying.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.813
Good night, Mom.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.148
Lucky you. I still have two more hours.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.610
[marching band playing]

18:32.361 --> 18:33.904
[yells] Good night, you two!

18:37.783 --> 18:39.785
[band continues playing]

18:40.536 --> 18:41.662
What is happening?

18:41.745 --> 18:43.872
We might have summoned a ghost band!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.165
[doorbell rings]

18:49.336 --> 18:50.420
[Alexa yells]

18:50.504 --> 18:52.089
R-Ryan, no! No, no, no!

18:52.172 --> 18:55.509
-Shh! Shh!
-Please stop! Shh! Please!

18:55.592 --> 18:56.593
[tuba playing]

18:56.677 --> 18:59.638
Hi, Katie. Katie. Katie... hi.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.057
Can you please stop that?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.308
[playing stops]

19:03.392 --> 19:04.226
Sorry.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.310
[Alexa sighs]

19:06.186 --> 19:07.187
OK. Um...

19:07.271 --> 19:09.148
Um... OK.

19:09.731 --> 19:10.566
Here it is. Um...

19:10.649 --> 19:11.859
Katie Cooper...

19:12.568 --> 19:14.361
will you go to the Winter Formal with me?

19:14.444 --> 19:16.989
[Jack over walkie-talkie]
Guys, Mom's coming over there!

19:18.532 --> 19:19.533
Everybody, hide!

19:19.616 --> 19:21.034
[Alexa groans]

19:21.118 --> 19:24.204
I-I'm sorry, Ryan, but I can't.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.668
[cymbals crashing]

19:31.962 --> 19:33.797
[Jennifer panting]

19:33.881 --> 19:34.882
Hello?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.009
I am a woman with a bat.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.680
I have a full-time job, finals this week,
and I just had two cups of coffee!

19:41.763 --> 19:42.931
Let's dance!

19:44.933 --> 19:46.602
-Hey!
-Mom, we were just studying.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.936
In Katie's room.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.479
So, w-what's going on, Mom?

19:50.063 --> 19:52.441
It sounds like a marching band
or something?

19:52.941 --> 19:55.194
Oh, yeah, nothing in here.

19:56.028 --> 20:00.032
-Well, there's nothing in here, either.
-Oh, yeah. Everything's safe and sound.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.408
[Alexa mutters]

20:01.491 --> 20:02.910
[tuba honks]

20:02.993 --> 20:04.411
What was that?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.496
Excuse me.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.838
Well, I got some Christmas shopping done.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.090
I hope your mom and dad heart Dallas.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.967
Where's Lucas?

20:19.509 --> 20:20.510
I don't know.

20:21.011 --> 20:24.056
He's not taking this seriously.
I don't know what's going on with him.

20:24.139 --> 20:27.768
I'd look at his questionnaire if it wasn't
wrong to snoop on his computer.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.479
Hm.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.814
Honey, that's a breach of privacy.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.775
I call it "good parenting."

20:35.651 --> 20:37.110
And a weak password.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.446
Here's his questionnaire.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.075
He never even filled it out!
I can't believe it.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.494
I can't believe his password is "Lucas"!

20:48.455 --> 20:49.331
OK.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.626
That was way too close.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.629
I don't know,
maybe we should text Hannah and Reagan

20:55.712 --> 20:57.881
and just tell them the sleepover's over.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.341
But we want to see the sunrise.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.470
Katie, tomorrow,
everything goes back to normal.

21:03.553 --> 21:07.057
Back to, "Did you take a nap?"
"Don't forget to take your medicine."

21:07.140 --> 21:09.768
"Oh, sorry.
No, you can't do that, or that, or that."

21:11.270 --> 21:14.022
Look, as long as we stay up, we're free.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.816
It's our time.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.278
-OK, let's do it.
-Yes!

21:19.361 --> 21:22.489
Jack, we're going over
to Alexa's. Good night.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.748
Ouija, why did Katie say no to Ryan?

21:32.332 --> 21:33.583
He's so cute.

21:34.876 --> 21:35.919
Hm.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.881
"Poor Katie was embarrassed

21:39.965 --> 21:41.717
and didn't know what to say.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.593
And he was wearing a drum."

21:45.053 --> 21:47.931
Wow. Ouija's a little defensive tonight.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.809
Wait. How did Ryan know Katie was here?

21:50.892 --> 21:53.395
-Oh, I've been Instagramming all night.
-Hannah!

21:53.478 --> 21:54.771
I know!

21:54.855 --> 21:59.401
Apparently #SecretSleepover
isn't so secret to some people.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.445
Oh, I've got another one!

22:02.154 --> 22:04.823
Ouija, is there a ghost in this house?

22:07.242 --> 22:08.243
Oh, it's moving!

22:08.327 --> 22:10.037
Did somebody call me?

22:13.665 --> 22:15.292
Oh, Mom! Uh...

22:15.375 --> 22:17.127
W-We can explain.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.629
-Alexa?
-Yeah. Uh...

22:20.130 --> 22:21.798
So, I forgot my book and I need--

22:21.882 --> 22:23.383
Don't embarrass yourself.

Kyle's mom called me
on my way back from Wired.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.805
Then I turned Jack and he spied on you

22:28.889 --> 22:31.016
while you all thought he was spying on me,

22:31.099 --> 22:33.185
so I could keep an eye on you
while I studied.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.146
You're good!

22:36.813 --> 22:37.939
Well, he's eight.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.068
So Jack was a double agent?

I'm not even really asleep.

22:44.821 --> 22:48.241
OK, so, you girls clean up here.
You'll all come sleep over at Katie's.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.660
Um... Are you going to tell my mom?

22:50.994 --> 22:53.246
Not if you don't tell her
I forgot to feed you dinner.

23:02.589 --> 23:03.715
There you are.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.052
When were you gonna fill out
your questionnaire?

23:07.135 --> 23:10.388
I was gonna... Wait.
Did you look through my computer?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.474
Of course not! Your mother did.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.519
And don't change the subject.

23:16.019 --> 23:19.272
Look, if you don't want to go
to the Air Force Academy, just say that.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.524
I don't want to go.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.192

[Lucas sighs]

23:30.909 --> 23:35.705
Listen, Dad, I didn't want to tell you
because I don't want to let you down.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.166
So what are you gonna do instead?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.669
Go to a party school
and major in good times?

23:41.670 --> 23:42.838
Oncology.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.757
What?

When Alexa got sick I saw everything
the doctors were doing,

23:49.094 --> 23:52.222
and it made me want to go somewhere
that has a really good med school.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.182
I want to help people,

23:54.266 --> 23:55.559
like they helped Alexa.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.353
I am so proud of you, son.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.086
Yeah, why doesn't Wired deliver to trees?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.672
Trees don't drink coffee.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.182
Hey, do you like Dylan?

24:36.433 --> 24:37.767
I think he really likes you.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.106
OK.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.484
Maybe I like him.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.570
Yeah, you do.

24:52.866 --> 24:57.412
I'm glad we did this sleepy
up-all-night thing.
