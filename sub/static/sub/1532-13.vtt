00:02.240 --> 00:03.446
Previously on Arrow:

00:03.600 --> 00:06.763
That woman running around
in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.

00:06.920 --> 00:09.810
- It was. Who else would it be?
- That's why I'm talking to you.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.121
Who are we running from?

00:11.360 --> 00:14.967
His name is Ra's al Ghul. And he's
marked me and my family for death.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.129
I heard a rumor you were leaving town.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.288
Happy to say that those rumors are false.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.888
Ra's is going to come for me.
And he will learn the truth about Sara.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.600
- He'll come for Thea.
- That's why I have to kill him.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.361
- You couldn't before.
- This time I will have you to train me.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.328
Dinah Laurel Lance.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.122
Selfish bitch.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.970
You're not a hero.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.802
You're a liar. A fraud.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.490
And an addict.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.925
Sara.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.051
Sara, please. Please. I'm your sister.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.171
Then why are you trying
to take my place? Unh!

02:02.040 --> 02:04.202
What the hell do you think you're doing?

02:05.040 --> 02:06.371
Your job, apparently.

02:09.039 --> 02:13.409
- I told you that I didn't want you out here.
- And I told you that it wasn't your call to make.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.724
Think for a second about what it would do to
your father if something happened to you.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.247
What you're doing is selfish.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.046
Fighting for your city isn't selfish.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.611
It's what a hero would do.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.729
You're not a hero.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.084
Maybe it's best if we stay
out of each other's way.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.404
How'd it go out there?

02:37.560 --> 02:40.928
We ran into Laurel. Again.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.243
Diggle, how could you sign off
on her doing this?

02:44.400 --> 02:47.609
You might not notice, but she's not
lobbying for anyone's permission.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.609
- She has yours.
- Well, not at first.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.481
- But she can definitely hold her own out there.
- You have a visitor.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.445
Or as I like to call him, your new BFF.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.809
- I see things are running smoothly down here.
- What do you want?

03:01.640 --> 03:04.962
It's been a week since your return.
I thought it past time we spoke.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.282
Nanda Parbat is remote.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.962
But I wouldn't delude yourself
into thinking that Ra's al Ghul missed...

03:12.160 --> 03:14.288
...your televised return to Starling City.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.771
Your point, Malcolm?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.800
We can't merely wait
for Ra's to mobilize his forces.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.167
It's time to bring Thea into the fold.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.164
She's not ready to know my secret.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.970
I disagree.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.209
But in any case...

03:29.720 --> 03:31.722
...if we are to protect Thea...

03:31.960 --> 03:33.803
...and to defeat the League...

03:33.960 --> 03:36.122
...the three of us need to join forces.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.840
I don't see how we can do that
if she is to believe...

03:41.000 --> 03:45.801
...that her brother is a reformed playboy
and failed businessman.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.321
I told you before, if Thea finds out
you've been lying to her all this time...

03:53.480 --> 03:55.801
...you will lose her. Forever.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.607
How's Tatsu?

04:00.800 --> 04:03.406
She'll be better when we're far away
from here. Your bow.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.689
Want anything else, take it quickly.
We're leaving in five minutes.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.161
- We're not coming back.
- We can't just run.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.045
Waller knows I tried to steal the virus
to get Tatsu back.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.526
Even if she didn't...

04:13.680 --> 04:16.000
...Chien Na Wei knows where we live.
We have to go.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.204
- Look, Maseo...
- If you stay, Waller will torture you to find us.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.609
Contact your family, contact the press.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.207
Once the world knows Oliver Queen
is still alive...

04:25.360 --> 04:27.044
...it will limit A.R.G.U.S.' options.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.681
Make it more difficult for Waller
to assassinate you.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.611
That's reassuring.
What are you gonna do?

04:32.840 --> 04:36.561
I'll take Akio and Tatsu on the ferry
to Shanghai.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.889
From there, we will disappear.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.048
You saved us.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.202
Now save yourself.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.686
Mr. Zytle. Vertigo. Mr. Zytle.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.411
- How many have your drug killed?
- How many have you killed?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.130
Reaction to sentencing, Mr. Zytle?

05:04.320 --> 05:08.723
The Roman governor, Porcius Festus,
maintained that the accused...

05:08.920 --> 05:11.605
...has the right to face their accuser.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.928
Now, where is my accuser?

05:14.720 --> 05:17.166
I speak, of course, of the Arrow.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.926
Excuse me, Mr. Zytle
has no further comments.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.169
ADA Laurel Lance. Take him to the van.
Thank you.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.084
Stay back. Stay back!

05:44.360 --> 05:45.441
Where's Zytle?

05:49.560 --> 05:50.607
Hey.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.685
So you still haven't told me,
what did you think of my set last night?

05:54.920 --> 05:57.161
Fan girls on Vine called
it "epically epic."

05:57.360 --> 06:00.125
More like "epically profitable."

06:00.280 --> 06:02.681
It's kind of hot when
you talk business and numbers.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.805
Chase. God, if you ever really
wanna kiss me again...

06:07.000 --> 06:09.571
...you're gonna have to work on your game.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.370
Later, princess.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.531
Ollie.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.960
Hey, Speedy-

06:18.720 --> 06:21.166
I'm so happy you're home.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.689
What?

06:26.840 --> 06:28.808
I have to show you something.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.608
- Where are we going?
- The basement.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.690
I thought that you said
that it was flooded.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.484
I lied.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.929
Ollie, what's going on?
You're kind of making me nervous.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.761
I know that this isn't gonna mean much...

07:21.520 --> 07:25.206
...and I've given you no reason
to believe me when I say it...

07:25.360 --> 07:29.888
...but I lied all of this
time to protect you.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.610
You're...

07:41.760 --> 07:42.807
You're him.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.210
Yeah.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.565
That night with the Hoods...

07:53.760 --> 07:55.808
...and the woman in black, that...

07:56.040 --> 07:58.691
That was Ra's al Ghul's daughter.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.084
That was you.

08:08.280 --> 08:15.209
All those times I got so mad at you
for being a flake...

08:15.400 --> 08:20.008
...or telling me something I knew
that had to be a lie...

08:25.200 --> 08:27.521
...you were saving someone's life.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.645
Thank you.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.730
Thank you.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.284
Thank you.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.402
You know how many times I've wished
that I could thank the Arrow...

09:02.640 --> 09:04.927
...for things he's done for this city?

09:06.080 --> 09:09.448
Probably as many times as I've wished
we could have this conversation.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.210
Did Mom know?

09:12.680 --> 09:16.446
The night that she died, she told me...

09:16.640 --> 09:18.961
...that she'd known for a while.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.969
I was worried that you'd be angry.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.410
Only because you broke my window.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.967
Although I did kind of kick your ass.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.321
You didn't.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.849
- But you did have a good teacher.
- You were looking for Malcolm that night.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.610
We know about each other.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.842
Wait, Malcolm knows that you're the Arrow?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.971
I am amazed that he didn't tell you.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.767
And why did you tell me?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.007
Why now?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.640
Because Ra's al Ghul is coming for us.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.567
All of us.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.687
And the only chance that we have to survive
is to work together.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.120
To trust each other.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.646
He's right.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.125
No.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.362
No. No, he's not.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.370
I turned my back on everyone I know.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.688
Including my own brother.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.201
Because you told me there was nobody
I could trust.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.522
I was only trying to protect you.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.649
By driving a wedge between me and Ollie?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.361
You manipulated me.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.008
- Thea.
- Let her go.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.891
Yeah.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.411
You've reached Moira Queen.
Please leave a message.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.164
Mom, it's me.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.802
I'm alive. I'm... I'm in Hong Kong.
I know it sounds crazy...

10:49.040 --> 10:51.930
...but I'm alive, I'm in Hong Kong,
and I need your help.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.847
I want you to call Ned Foster, you tell him
to issue a press release. Tell everyone.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.326
You tell Thea.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.568
I'm coming home. I love you...

11:23.280 --> 11:24.327
What do we know?

11:24.520 --> 11:28.127
Apparently the federal marshal guarding
Werner Zytle just started shooting...

11:28.320 --> 11:30.209
...while Zytle waltzed off in the panic.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.564
This is my favorite part.

11:34.440 --> 11:38.161
It's pretty convenient. Guy decides
to wig out and Zytle takes advantage.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.011
It's planned.
Those are the effects of his Vertigo.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.964
Zytle was in a full set of restraints.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.563
- How did he manage to dose a federal agent?
- He didn't. One of the reporters did.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.287
What's wrong?

11:49.520 --> 11:50.806
Was my form off?

11:51.360 --> 11:53.203
She's right. About the reporter.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.968
- We need a name...
- And address on our clumsy reporter. I'm on it.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.610
What do you think you're doing?

12:07.800 --> 12:09.370
- I'm coming with you.
- You're not.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.324
I just gave you your only lead.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.205
Talk to you for a second? Alone?

12:19.720 --> 12:24.089
I know what you're gonna say. But I risked
my life for this city while you were gone.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.011
- That should earn me respect.
- This isn't about respect.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.168
And it's not about you risking your life.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.283
I understand that you miss Sara.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.005
And I understand that when you go out there
like this...

12:36.160 --> 12:37.844
...all of that pain goes away.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.525
- It's the only time it ever does.
- That relief isn't real.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.761
It's a drug.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.606
- If you're implying...
- You are an addict.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.168
Just like with booze and pills,
that high you're chasing every night...

12:50.360 --> 12:53.250
...is endangering your life.
Go to hell, Oliver.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.807
You don't get to play that card with me.
Even

12:56.960 --> 13:02.967
And if there is anyone who's using adrenaline to
hide the pain of real feelings and real life...

13:03.160 --> 13:04.889
...it's you.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.922
Oliver. Felicity tracked down
the reporter's work address.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.930
Anthony Walker. Where's Werner Zytle?

13:20.120 --> 13:23.567
- He's not... He's not here.
- You helped him escape today.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.042
Zytle threatened my wife.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.330
Said he could get to her,
that he'd kill her if I didn't do this.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.766
Do what?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.486
Kill you.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.564
- I'm so sorry.
- Anthony.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.000
Give me the detonator.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.884
He'll kill my Wife.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.889
We can protect her.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.003
Promise.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.249
Now, hand me the detonator.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.010
God forgive me.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.931
I will weep for thee.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.803
Ollie?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.245
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

14:41.480 --> 14:42.845
Can't sleep.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.965
Apparently insomnia is a common side effect
of finding out your brother's a vigilante.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.122
Heh. Right.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.524
You smell like smoke.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.530
- Korean barbeque?
- C4.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.160
Yeah.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.567
Nice that we can tell each other
this stuff now.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.683
It is, actually.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.930
You always had the lamest excuses.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.886
Lame excuses are sort of
an occupational hazard.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.084
What was tonight's hazard?

15:13.280 --> 15:18.605
Roy and I were looking for the man that
escaped from the courthouse earlier today.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.723
We found a bomb instead.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.082
Yeah, I don't know how you do it.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.001
Just risk your life out there
for people every night.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.844
It's my job.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.844
It is my job...

15:31.040 --> 15:33.566
...to keep the people of this city safe.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.206
And that includes you too, Speedy.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.923
Listen to me.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.042
I'm always gonna hate Malcolm Merlyn.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.642
But right now, he is a necessary evil.

15:47.880 --> 15:52.090
- We can take care of ourselves...
- Not against Ra's al Ghul.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.684
You have to trust me on this.

15:55.880 --> 15:56.961
I do.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.288
But I don't trust him.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.290
I can't.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.205
And I won't.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.205
Ten minutes.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.323
I'm impressed.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.603
I know Special Forces
who can't last longer than three.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.648
Eventually, though, everybody breaks.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.207
Tell me where the Yamashiros are
and it will stop.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.649
My family's gonna be looking for me.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.729
Everyone is gonna be looking for me.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.049
Because your mother issued
a press release?

16:42.760 --> 16:45.570
We erased your message
before she could hear a word of it.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.689
Be glad.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.171
If she had heard it,
your mother would be dead right now.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.846
You would never risk the exposure.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.371
You're right.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.370
Your mother's too public a figure.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.881
But your sister on the other hand...

17:02.120 --> 17:03.884
What's her name?

17:04.119 --> 17:05.565
Thea?

17:07.599 --> 17:10.887
Did you know she's developed something
of a substance abuse problem...

17:11.079 --> 17:12.969
...since you've been gone?

17:13.160 --> 17:18.405
I guess the strain of losing two family members
must have been too much for her to bear.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.403
One day, someone may just find her
in the back of a car...

17:24.640 --> 17:27.211
...dead with a needle in her arm.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.041
Poor Speedy.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.443
You stay away from my sister.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.484
I will. If you answer one question.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.570
Where are the Yamashiros?

17:52.040 --> 17:54.486
The ferry to Shanghai.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.650
Knock, knock.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.481
H9)'-

18:06.640 --> 18:10.645
You know, half the department is still talking
about the way you clocked that marshal.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.041
Those boxing lessons look like
they're paying off.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.321
Yeah, I guess so.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.761
Are those the cargo manifests
for the whole city?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.691
Yeah. Although, I gotta ask.
What do you need these for?

18:19.880 --> 18:22.247
Just a RICO case that I'm second chairing.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.726
Right.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.404
- Dad.
- Yeah. Sorry, I just...

18:30.120 --> 18:31.963
Have you heard from Sara lately?

18:32.160 --> 18:33.446
No. Why?

18:35.120 --> 18:37.361
I ran into her a few weeks back.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.451
And something just felt a little off.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.328
Then I ran into that friend of hers.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.291
You know the one with the, uh...
The boy hair?

18:48.520 --> 18:50.682
- Sin.
- Yeah, Sin. That's it.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.770
She said something strange.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.169
She said that the woman in black
isn't Sara.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.608
- That doesn't make any sense.
- No.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.089
I mean, look, I just wanna talk to her,
you know? Sara or not.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.005
But look, don't worry. I said I'd
start taking it easy, I meant it.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.204
I'll get out of your hair.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.525
You know, I've been wondering.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.810
How do you decide between the red hoodie
and the one with the mask?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.445
I'm glad you know.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.690
I felt pretty lame not recognizing my own
brotherjust because he's wearing a hood.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.247
I can't believe you knew before I did.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.885
He saved my life, Thea.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.522
He saved a lot of people's lives.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.922
- He thinks we need Merlyn's help.
- Hm.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.570
And what do you think?

20:03.560 --> 20:07.804
I think I wanna get as far away
from Malcolm Merlyn as I possibly can.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.889
Well, there's your answer right there.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.726
Hey.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.849
Sorry. May I borrow him for a second?

20:16.440 --> 20:20.365
Apparently he's been more yours
than mine lately, so...

20:28.280 --> 20:29.327
What happened?

20:29.480 --> 20:31.767
One of our trackers sent a signal
from the docks.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.810
Except we don't have any tracking devices
in the field.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.929
Unless we do.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.810
It's Laurel.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.170
- You tagged Laurel with a tracer?
- If she's gonna be reckless...

20:43.320 --> 20:46.802
...I need to know what she's doing.
She's definitely doing something.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.685
Just not exactly sure how reckless it is.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.284
I ran the manifest on these shipping
containers you see here.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.761
One of these leads back
to Zytle's old supplier.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.727
- Looks like Vertigo's back in business.
- She's gonna get herself killed.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.445
Suit up.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.169
Hey! Unh!

21:22.480 --> 21:23.845
Come on.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.207
Wonderful seeing you again.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.681
Ooh, I fancy the new outfit.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.966
Feeling my Vertigo, dear?

21:51.400 --> 21:55.405
Wonderful to...

21:55.600 --> 21:59.605
Dinah Laurel Lance.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.807
Selfish bitch.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.162
You're not a hero.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.203
You're a liar.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.841
A fraud.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.648
And an addict.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.607
Sara.

22:48.320 --> 22:52.291
Sara, please. Please. I'm your sister.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.086
Then why are you trying to take my place?

22:58.720 --> 22:59.881
Get away from her.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.605
You should be dead.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.280
I salute your persistence.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.644
Help me.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.130
Help... Help me.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.568
Help me. Help me.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.166
We need an IV.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.365
Watch her head.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.286
It's gonna be okay.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.482
- Why did I have to die?
- Sara.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.524
If you wanted to be me, you could have.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.131
I didn't have to die.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.044
I am so sorry.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.523
I'm so sorry, Sara. I'm so...

24:02.480 --> 24:03.811
Ollie.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.127
I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.890
Thea, go back upstairs.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.930
- Now!
- Hey. Don't talk to her like that.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.122
You don't have the right to kick her out.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.446
I'm not.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.286
- I'm protecting her.
- By telling her what to do?

24:19.480 --> 24:22.051
Work with Malcolm Merlyn,
let him get his hooks deeper?

24:22.240 --> 24:25.084
- Enough. She's my sister.
- She makes her own choices, Oliver.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.489
It's okay. We can talk later. I just...

24:28.680 --> 24:32.480
Just... is Laurel okay?
Is she a part of this too?

24:33.240 --> 24:34.890
She's gonna be fine.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.208
I promise. Just...

24:38.040 --> 24:39.883
Please go back upstairs.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.325
What the hell was that?

24:51.520 --> 24:53.807
You're the only person
who can stand up for Thea?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.566
I'm trying to figure out why
you're standing up to me.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.962
All right,
maybe we just need to throttle back.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.687
No. We need this. Oliver, you were gone.
Dead. At least we thought you were.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.360
And we had to go on with our lives.
And doing that...

25:05.600 --> 25:07.841
...meant not doing things your way.
Fine.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.010
- I'm back now.
- That doesn't mean that we can go back.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.286
And you do not have the right to come back
here and question everyone's choices.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.810
Just let me know if there's any change
in her condition.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.482
Hey. How's it going?

25:55.520 --> 25:57.010
What's that for?

25:57.240 --> 26:03.521
My life has been really complicated lately,
so I just need something simple.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.485
This seat taken?

26:17.720 --> 26:19.609
It's a free country.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.490
Apparently.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.566
The first time that we went after Zytle...

26:29.040 --> 26:31.441
...I told you that this was my crusade.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.330
- Doesn't seem to be the case anymore.
- You're right. It isn't.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.923
- You know, I get that I was gone...
- No, you weren't gone. You were dead.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.845
And all of us, including me,
we were ready to hang it up.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.766
Why didn't you?

26:45.960 --> 26:50.602
Because we realized we weren't just fighting
for you, we were fighting for ourselves too.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.526
That includes Roy.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.643
And yes, that includes Laurel.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.047
She's not a soldier.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.602
- Neither were you.
- It's not the same thing and you know that.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.884
What I know, Oliver,
is that you started something.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.649
Something strong enough
to live on past you.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.609
Question is...

27:16.800 --> 27:19.610
...can you live with what it's become?

27:33.400 --> 27:36.882
Oliver, are you all right?

27:39.480 --> 27:41.721
I told them you were on the ferry.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.327
I'm sorry.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.011
- They tortured you.
- I sold you out.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.410
No, you didn't.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.286
Because we were never going to Shanghai.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.686
I lied. A precaution just in case
you were captured.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.644
Then how'd they find you?

27:58.840 --> 27:59.966
They didn't.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.481
When I found out you'd been taken,
I came back.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.727
You're an idiot.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.322
Maybe. But I will not let you face
Waller alone for my actions.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.205
Now we're both gonna get tortured.
Or worse.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.481
Great plan.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.244
I must speak with Agent Waller.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.610
Hey! Why'd you...?

28:23.040 --> 28:24.963
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.167
H9)'-

28:26.360 --> 28:27.850
Hey, he)'-

28:29.280 --> 28:32.329
- Hey.
- How are you feeling?

28:38.400 --> 28:40.801
When Zytle hit me with Vertigo, I...

28:42.280 --> 28:43.805
I saw Sara.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.844
She was alive.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.888
And she was calling me a fraud.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.727
I was crazy to think that I was fit
to wear Sara's jacket.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.563
So much as follow in her footsteps.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.167
You're right.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.569
I hope I'm not out of line here...

29:11.960 --> 29:15.123
...but I think Sara wore her mask
just as much to hide her demons...

29:15.320 --> 29:16.685
...as she did to help people.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.968
And I don't see that with you.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.963
You have a light inside of you
that Sara never had.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.648
So maybe you should stop trying to be Sara.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.441
And just be yourself.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.411
Thank you.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.811
What's that?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.129
One of the chemical drums Zytle stole
tonight sent out a GPS signal.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.800
Why?

30:00.600 --> 30:02.841
Because he just opened it.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.688
I dig your place.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.247
I'm sorry I interrupted the tour.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.410
Pretty sure you saw everything
you needed to.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.484
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.844
This was nice.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.571
I almost took it personally
when you said I was simple.

30:37.720 --> 30:41.167
Well, I never said that you were simple.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.006
What?

30:52.920 --> 30:54.160
Nothing, it...

30:54.360 --> 30:56.249
It's just something my father once said.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.210
We were sitting in this little taberna
in Corto Maltese...

31:00.400 --> 31:03.131
...drinking this amazing Carménére...

31:03.960 --> 31:05.928
...and he said that for centuries...

31:06.120 --> 31:10.728
...noblemen had been using
the rich aroma of red wine...

31:10.920 --> 31:13.810
...to cover up a very different scent.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.210
Cyanide.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.565
Tell me who you are
and what you think you're doing here.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.047
Serving my master, Ra's al Ghul.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.691
- Please.
- Don't struggle.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.201
I can do this so you won't feel a thing.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.721
Get away from her.

31:47.320 --> 31:52.406
If you beg forgiveness for trying to harm
my daughter, I'll grant you a quick death.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.841
I'd never give you the
satisfaction, Al Sa-Her.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.162
You're unarmed
and you have nowhere to run.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.250
But there's someplace I can go
where you won't dare to follow.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.688
Daggett Pharmaceuticals. 5th and Kingsley.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.168
Looks like Zytle found a place to change
those chemicals into Vertigo.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.401
And he's got hostages.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.204
- Where's Roy?
- I can't reach him.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.284
Laurel.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.686
Oliver.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.089
There isn't anything that you can say to me
that I don't already know.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.402
Actually, there is.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.803
I must once again thank you...

32:58.000 --> 33:02.210
...for letting us use your laboratory
this evening.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.803
And my sincerest apologies
to your colleague here...

33:07.040 --> 33:11.443
...but mistakes will not be tolerated.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.409
Werner Zytle.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.646
- This ends now.
- As you wish.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.525
May I suggest a grand finale?

33:36.920 --> 33:39.764
Chlorine trifluoride.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.610
Oliver, I'm registering an enormous spike
in thermal activity.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.764
- The whole place is gonna blow.
- You have to get out of there.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.886
Not yet.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.242
Go. Run! Now!

34:14.520 --> 34:15.806
Unh!

34:20.840 --> 34:22.080
I'm surprised.

34:23.080 --> 34:29.531
Usually women don't return
for a second go with me.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.882
- Hi, sis.
- You're not her.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.204
You're not real.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.607
Oh, I'm quite real.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.324
You lied to me, Laurel!

34:54.520 --> 34:57.171
Straight to my face! My own daughter!

34:57.400 --> 35:00.051
Sara was my daughter.
I deserved to know. I had a right.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.930
To grieve! To mourn!

35:02.480 --> 35:05.643
And who do you think you are
to take that away from me, huh?

35:05.840 --> 35:07.808
Who do you think you are?

35:08.040 --> 35:10.168
- I'm sorry.
- I know you are.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.363
She said she's sorry,
but she would do it again.

35:19.080 --> 35:23.404
You keep my own daughter's death a secret
because you think I'm too weak for the truth?

35:23.640 --> 35:26.291
You think you can wear my mask?

35:26.480 --> 35:28.528
You think you can be me?

35:28.720 --> 35:30.290
No.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.727
And I'm done trying to be.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.846
Oliver, are you there?

35:56.040 --> 35:58.327
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.646
You have to get home.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.325
It's Thea.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.647
Okay, all good.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.243
- Hey.
- ls everything okay?

36:13.480 --> 36:17.326
Oh, yeah, just the usual insurance policy
search and seizure.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.807
Seems like I'm a high-risk case.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.729
Wonder what gave them that idea.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.051
What's the matter? You okay?

36:25.720 --> 36:27.165
Um...

36:28.840 --> 36:32.481
There's, um...
There's something that I have to tell you.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.446
And I didn't tell you...

36:37.240 --> 36:40.847
I didn't tell you before
because I was worried about your health.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.961
But I realized...

36:44.400 --> 36:45.765
...that you deserve to know.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.047
I already know it.

36:50.560 --> 36:54.485
Sara's off God knows where, and yet there's
another blond in a mask running around...

36:54.680 --> 36:57.365
...tuning up the bad guys,
and it's you, isn't it?

37:01.480 --> 37:05.405
Sweetheart, come on. It's all right.
It's okay.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.409
It's okay, honey.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.809
I mean, look, I am pissed as hell,
but, you know, we'll figure it out.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.691
- We figure out everything.
- No, no. No, Daddy, that...

37:16.040 --> 37:17.769
That isn't what I was gonna tell you.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.002
What I was gonna tell you...

37:23.160 --> 37:25.162
...is about Sara.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.289
No.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.249
Dad.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.160
No.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.606
- No.
- Dad.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.851
Not again.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.888
- Daddy.
- Not my baby. Not again.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.764
Sweetheart.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.086
I can't do this.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.245
Thea?

38:03.960 --> 38:06.088
It's okay. You're okay.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.531
I thought that I was stronger.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.647
I thought that I could keep myself safe.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.126
- Who was he?
- One of Ra's' agents.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.565
Roy...

38:24.960 --> 38:26.724
...can you give us a minute?

38:32.920 --> 38:35.810
I really hope you're not expecting
a "thank you."

38:36.080 --> 38:38.686
No parent needs gratitude
for saving their child.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.887
I didn't ask to be a part of this.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.367
I didn't ask for any of this.

38:48.640 --> 38:50.449
Maybe you were right.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.166
Maybe we can't do this without him.

38:58.760 --> 39:03.084
But I am never gonna forget
the things you've done.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.484
- Or the person that you are.
- Understood.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.122
But before we can begin...

39:09.360 --> 39:12.489
...there's something that only the two
of you can do.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.887
Ra's al Ghul preys upon the fears
of his enemies.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.763
Conquer your own fear...

39:19.520 --> 39:22.330
...and you eliminate
that critical advantage.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.044
For you...

39:25.240 --> 39:27.925
...there is only one place on earth
uniquely suited...

39:28.120 --> 39:29.849
...to doing that.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.730
So you're leaving again?

39:31.920 --> 39:34.207
She's got a point, man. You just got back.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.004
It's just for a few days.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.806
Ordinarily, I wouldn't do this.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.645
But it's for Thea.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.211
And if you've shown me anything,
it's that this city...

39:44.440 --> 39:46.647
...is more than safe in your hands.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.447
All of your hands.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.645
Thank you.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.565
Ollie told you we're heading out for a bit?

40:13.280 --> 40:14.327
You cool with it all?

40:15.680 --> 40:19.048
After the whole Chase thing,
I think it's gonna be a little while...

40:19.240 --> 40:21.368
...before I'm cool with anything.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.361
What was that for?

40:31.240 --> 40:32.321
Take your pick.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.127
Saving my life or standing up to Oliver
about Malcolm.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.769
I should get going.

40:49.040 --> 40:52.886
Come on, Speedy, we have four more miles
to make before nightfall.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.170
Ugh. God.

40:56.320 --> 41:00.245
I get that Malcolm wants to whip us
into shape so we can face the League...

41:00.440 --> 41:02.841
...but don't you think
this is a little bit excessive?

41:04.240 --> 41:06.891
We've been here for two hours.
Are you complaining already?

41:07.880 --> 41:10.406
I started thinking it after
the first 10 minutes.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.282
Well, give it time.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.002
Eventually, this place will feel like home.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.651
It does not look like home.

41:19.360 --> 41:24.491
It was for me. For other people,
this is purgatory.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.849
You're not dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

41:32.040 --> 41:36.523
Once again, you have the good fortune
of being uniquely qualified to help me.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.046
Me?

41:38.680 --> 41:39.806
Why?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.685
Chien Na Wei has left Hong Kong.
We've tracked her here.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.245
Here?

41:44.480 --> 41:46.289
Where are we?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.928
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.
