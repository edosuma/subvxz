Throughout all of our ghost

01:22.399 --> 01:25.000
it's always been a very
special time for us

01:25.002 --> 01:27.035

01:52.897 --> 01:56.698
We've decided to call back
some past guests,

01:56.700 --> 01:59.001
but these aren't
any ordinary guests.

01:59.003 --> 02:02.805
These experts, much like
the artifacts in my museum,

02:02.807 --> 02:05.741
are extremely
haunted themselves.

02:05.743 --> 02:08.744
They've affected us deeply
with their rituals,

02:08.746 --> 02:12.181
but their mystical
and often dangerous powers

02:12.183 --> 02:15.450
have also given us
incredible evidence.

02:17.822 --> 02:20.622
Tonight they will set out
to prove this

Have you ever done this,
spun three times?

And what do you say
three times into the mirror?

02:32.837 --> 02:34.036
Bloody Mary.

02:34.038 --> 02:39.541
<i>Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.</i>

02:39.543 --> 02:41.176
Has she ever appeared to you?

[ Thunder rumbles ]

02:48.953 --> 02:50.352
Bloody Mary.
-Mm-hmm.

02:50.354 --> 02:52.855
I brought you here
to the museum

02:52.857 --> 02:55.324
because I want you
to use the same powers

02:55.326 --> 02:58.260
that you have used on
previous investigations.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.262
BLOODY MARY: The spirit, the
fates come with us right now.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.331
Open the way
and come dance with us.

03:02.333 --> 03:06.301
Instead of you using
your objects,

03:06.303 --> 03:08.604
I have the objects
that I'd like you to use.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.573
BLOODY MARY: Right.

03:11.575 --> 03:13.041
Directly behind you...

03:13.043 --> 03:14.843
And look in this room.

03:14.845 --> 03:16.478
...is a human skull...

03:16.480 --> 03:17.646
Mm-hmm.

03:17.648 --> 03:21.717
...that I found in the attic
of an old hotel.

03:21.719 --> 03:24.253
The lady that sold it to me

03:24.255 --> 03:26.555
said that she wanted
to get rid of it

03:26.557 --> 03:30.125
and that it cursed a family
that owned it before me.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.730
-That snake.
-You want the snake?

03:34.732 --> 03:36.899
-Yeah. I want the snake.
-Okay.

-Do we put them all together?

03:43.774 --> 03:45.908
And we'll see what
we can summon.

03:45.910 --> 03:48.310
ZAK: I want to see if you
can use these objects

03:48.312 --> 03:50.479
to communicate
or make contact...

03:50.481 --> 03:51.747
BLOODY MARY: Got you.

03:51.749 --> 03:53.415
...with the spirit
that's attached to it,

03:53.417 --> 03:54.917
and I know that
can be dangerous,

03:54.919 --> 03:56.551
and we're prepared
for that.

03:56.553 --> 03:57.519
I need water.

03:57.521 --> 03:59.554
I need a candle,
and I need liquor.

04:22.713 --> 04:24.780
There's a knock at the door.

04:24.782 --> 04:27.516
I wonder who it can be.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.719
One thing you may want to do
is cover your neck.

04:30.721 --> 04:34.089

-Hello, Zak.

-...good to see you.
-This is my consort Isibella.

-Hello, Isibella.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.336

filming something called

04:47.338 --> 04:48.370
"NetherWorld"...

04:48.372 --> 04:50.405
-Yes.
-...in the Paris Catacombs.

04:50.407 --> 04:54.142
Can you please tell everyone
a little bit about yourself?

04:54.144 --> 04:55.744
I'm a fang-smith and impresario

04:55.746 --> 04:58.347
of the Endless Night Vampire
Ball in New Orleans.

04:58.349 --> 05:03.352
And I'm also an avid occultist,
and Isibella is my consort.

05:03.354 --> 05:05.954
She has been working with me
for several years now.

05:08.258 --> 05:10.559
I want to take you to a room
and show you something

05:10.561 --> 05:12.894
that I would like you
to get started on.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.498
So we have Father Sebastian,
the vampire, and I'm thinking,

05:16.500 --> 05:19.701
"What object can I
have you work with?"

05:19.703 --> 05:21.503
ZAK: Here at my museum,

05:21.505 --> 05:24.740
we have the cursed mirror
of Bela Lugosi,

05:24.742 --> 05:28.910
the screen actor
who immortalized Dracula.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.712
The interesting thing
about this mirror

05:30.714 --> 05:33.448
is it came from
Bela Lugosi's house.

05:33.450 --> 05:36.852
Bela Lugosi was very heavily
involved in the occult.

05:36.854 --> 05:41.857
After his passing, Frank Saletri
moved into Bela's house,

05:41.859 --> 05:46.161
where he lived until 1982
when he was brutally murdered

05:46.163 --> 05:49.598
directly in front
of this mirror.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.601
But that is not the end
of this story.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.371
Cindy Lee inherited the mirror
from her deceased uncle

05:56.373 --> 05:59.274
and witnessed her daughter
repeatedly strangled

05:59.276 --> 06:03.011
by an entity that would
emerge from the mirror.

06:03.013 --> 06:07.416
She could feel
the teeth bite her neck.

06:07.418 --> 06:10.719
Is it possible Bela Lugosi
used this mirror

06:10.721 --> 06:13.321
in an attempt
to contact the dead

06:13.323 --> 06:15.857
through the practice of scrying,

06:15.859 --> 06:18.260
thus leaving open a portal

06:18.262 --> 06:21.430
that would trap the energy
of that brutal murder?

06:21.432 --> 06:22.831
[ Gunshot ]

06:22.833 --> 06:26.401
There's three symbols
of the vampire -- the fang,

06:26.403 --> 06:29.871
the ankh, the Egyptian
symbol of eternal life,

06:29.873 --> 06:31.139
and the mirror,

06:31.141 --> 06:33.742
which is a reflection
of the spirit world.

06:33.744 --> 06:36.111
When we communicate
with the ancestors,

06:36.113 --> 06:37.679
the mirror is the portal,

06:37.681 --> 06:39.981
but sometimes, things get
stuck in the mirror

06:39.983 --> 06:44.753
or get not quite
through death.

06:44.755 --> 06:45.821
Mm-hmm.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.489
And they are captured
by the mirror,

06:47.491 --> 06:48.957
and they're
in between worlds,

06:48.959 --> 06:51.860
and that was what the mirror
represents to the vampire.

06:51.862 --> 06:55.030
Would you be willing to do
something with this mirror,

06:55.032 --> 06:59.067
a vampire, doing this to
Bela Lugosi's cursed mirror,

06:59.069 --> 07:03.238
and see whether or not
you could get a reaction,

-Absolutely.

we are going to monitor

07:08.312 --> 07:10.879
this whole situation,

some scientific equipment.

08:08.205 --> 08:10.038
you've actually
gone darker.

You've gone more demonic.

unaware of the identity

from her the nature

that they have planned.

Bill Chappell

Mike will be watching.

All right.
This is it.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.109
Everybody is inside right now.

11:35.111 --> 11:39.747

literally, what is attached

11:39.749 --> 11:43.184
to not only my objects,
but to these people.

11:43.186 --> 11:45.086

That's where the
dangerous part sets in.

Bloody Mary in the basement.

that may be groundbreaking

12:05.509 --> 12:07.675
and better than
we ever have before.

12:07.677 --> 12:11.513

12:16.753 --> 12:19.954

bad vibes, like Lady Snake.

-Do you want to do this?

You can't be scared, Dakota.

begins his scrying session

13:01.531 --> 13:03.765
in the cursed
Bela Lugosi mirror,

violent attacks on other people,

13:12.042 --> 13:14.676
Communion
is the exchange of energy,

13:14.678 --> 13:17.412

is you pull energy.

and you push energy out.

13:20.517 --> 13:21.583

And I'll push energy
into your hand.

So I'm feeding on your energy
on this hand,

my energy on this hand,

begins to pick up

is doing,

14:10.433 --> 14:14.335
to perform a voodoo ritual on
the same exact concrete where,

14:14.337 --> 14:18.406
in the 1970s, dark rituals
were conducted in this house,

in an attempt to call
upon Ed's spirit

14:43.166 --> 14:47.502
or the darkness that possessed
him, Lady Snake says this...

14:49.673 --> 14:52.573
When we rewind and look
at the security-camera footage,

14:52.575 --> 14:55.643
we see Lady Snake
doing things that, again,

14:55.645 --> 14:58.646
Patti senses from the other
side of the building

14:58.648 --> 15:01.683

who Lady Snake is,

right now doing this ritual.

to slice open the portal
she's created

15:20.570 --> 15:22.370
in order to let Ed Gein in.

Then Lady Snake drops
a string into the cauldron.

And finally, an offering
of tobacco is made.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.068
She's talking about
how mirrors are gateways,

talking about mirrors.

a good mirror.

16:35.512 --> 16:37.678
Okay.
Well, let's do that, then.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.646
Okay because the spirit
that's connected to this mirror

16:38.648 --> 16:40.114
is full of love,

16:40.116 --> 16:43.317
and that's a easier energy
to be inspired by.

it very chaotic.

is we're gonna shatter it

Sebastian!

22:52.980 --> 22:55.180
Can you talk to me?

22:55.182 --> 22:57.849
What's wrong?

22:57.851 --> 22:59.518
Sebastian?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.454
As Father Sebastian is not
answering my questions,

23:02.456 --> 23:05.524
I am very concerned,
and at this same exact moment,

23:05.526 --> 23:08.827
a very strange light anomaly
appears near him

23:08.829 --> 23:10.362
in the corner of the screen.

23:10.364 --> 23:12.964
It seems to be moving away
from his body,

23:12.966 --> 23:16.168
and coincidentally,
immediately after this,

23:16.170 --> 23:19.204
he is finally able
to get up and speak to us.

23:19.206 --> 23:21.940
Sebastian, come here, buddy.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.543
One, two, three.

23:24.545 --> 23:28.146
[ Coughing ]

23:28.148 --> 23:30.649
ZAK: Sebastian, what? What?
Can you talk to me?

23:32.619 --> 23:35.053
Okay.

23:35.055 --> 23:39.891
¶¶

23:39.893 --> 23:41.092
Can you close it?

23:41.094 --> 23:46.231
¶¶

23:46.233 --> 23:47.432
Talk to me.

23:47.434 --> 23:51.136
I couldn't move,
and I couldn't talk.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.504
What were you doing?

23:52.506 --> 23:55.240
I was trying to get it
out of the mirror!

23:55.242 --> 23:57.542
I was using some
of your technique

23:57.544 --> 23:59.010
to try to piss it off.

23:59.012 --> 24:00.445
-You were provoking?
-Yeah.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.882
So what did you start...

24:03.884 --> 24:05.884
I just...
Suddenly, I couldn't move,

24:05.886 --> 24:08.220
and Isibella...

24:08.222 --> 24:10.555
huh, it sucked.

24:10.557 --> 24:13.525
ISIBELLA: Yeah. He, like, wasn't
responding to me until,

24:13.527 --> 24:16.328
like, I was talking to him,
and he wasn't responding.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.762
I...

24:17.764 --> 24:20.966
You were, like, being
provoking to it,

24:20.968 --> 24:22.734
and you were, like...

24:22.736 --> 24:26.671
¶¶

24:26.673 --> 24:29.608
Oh, all right.

24:29.610 --> 24:32.811
What I did experience was

24:32.813 --> 24:34.546
this mirror
is a lot heavier,

24:34.548 --> 24:36.448
and whatever is behind,
attached to this mirror,

24:36.450 --> 24:38.884
doesn't want to let
anything else through.

24:38.886 --> 24:40.018
It didn't jump out.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.887
I started seeing movement
in the mirror,

24:41.889 --> 24:43.688
but just, like, you know,
if you were looking at,

24:43.690 --> 24:45.190
like, a dark pond,

24:45.192 --> 24:47.726
and you saw, like,
white fish swimming around.

24:47.728 --> 24:48.793
ZAK: Stay there.

24:48.795 --> 24:50.195
Watch him and have him
keep talking.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.030
I have to grab a camera
real quick.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.732
ISIBELLA: This is gonna
sound really weird,

24:53.734 --> 24:55.934
but my neck is,
like, burning.

24:55.936 --> 24:57.535
The back of my neck
really hurts,

24:57.537 --> 24:59.004
and it's, like, burning up.

24:59.006 --> 25:00.205
AARON:
The back of your neck?

25:00.207 --> 25:02.941
Like, right now, yeah,
like, really painful.

25:02.943 --> 25:05.977
It's building, building,
building, doo,

25:05.979 --> 25:09.247
something with the back
of the head, back of the neck.

25:09.249 --> 25:13.151
Like, right here,
right here.

25:13.153 --> 25:14.653
-It's red.
-Like, right here.

25:14.655 --> 25:17.622
-Yeah, it is red.
-Really red.

25:17.624 --> 25:19.257
It's, like,
really hot, burning.

25:19.259 --> 25:21.693
Yeah. I'm serious.
-Look at that.

25:21.695 --> 25:23.428
-It's, like, a bruise.
-I'm really serious right now.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.963
-Zak!
-What?

25:24.965 --> 25:26.798
AARON: Come here.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.367
The other guy has got
scratches on him now, too.

25:29.369 --> 25:31.036
Show yourself to me!

25:37.344 --> 25:41.380
¶¶

25:41.382 --> 25:45.984
ZAK: Just moments ago, Isibella
encountered something troubling

25:45.986 --> 25:48.921
at the very moment
Father Sebastian collapsed

25:48.923 --> 25:50.856
while looking into
the cursed mirror

25:50.858 --> 25:52.257
of Bela Lugosi.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.826
-Zak!
-What?

25:53.828 --> 25:56.295
AARON: Come here.

25:56.297 --> 25:59.097
ISIBELLA: My heart is racing
really fast right now.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.199
ZAK: What is that?

26:00.201 --> 26:01.467
I had this burning
feeling on my neck.

26:01.469 --> 26:03.836
It really started hurting.
-It just started.

26:03.838 --> 26:05.137
AARON: She started complaining
about a burning feeling.

26:05.139 --> 26:07.005
It just gave her a huge burn.
-Come here.

26:07.007 --> 26:09.842
Come on. Let's go.
Get out.

26:09.844 --> 26:13.345
Get out.
We're gonna go.

26:13.347 --> 26:14.713
Get the two of them
outside for a second.

26:14.715 --> 26:18.317
Do you guys want to sit
down here for a minute?

26:18.319 --> 26:20.452
It's, like...

26:21.522 --> 26:27.960
I think that Father Sebastian
had an energy that was so strong

26:27.962 --> 26:31.263
that the energy trapped
inside of the mirror

26:31.265 --> 26:32.931
almost felt threatened...

26:32.933 --> 26:33.966
Aah!
Sebastian!

26:33.968 --> 26:35.834
...or almost
competitive with it.

26:35.836 --> 26:37.002
I think that you gave...

26:37.004 --> 26:38.670
I could feel everything
and was conscious,

26:38.672 --> 26:41.707
but I couldn't talk,
and I couldn't move.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.609
Were you seeing something
in the mirror at this time?

26:43.611 --> 26:46.645
Just little, like,
white things moving around.

26:46.647 --> 26:47.913
Were your eyes
moving around,

26:47.915 --> 26:49.615
or were your eyes staring
right into the mirror?

26:49.617 --> 26:50.649
Staring into the mirror.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.150
-And you couldn't move?
-I...

26:52.152 --> 26:53.051
It got to the point
where I just,

26:53.053 --> 26:54.253
suddenly, I couldn't move.

26:54.255 --> 26:56.355
Did you have any thoughts
to do anything to her?

26:56.357 --> 26:58.323
No.
-But that's not true.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.759
You turned to me
really weirdly

27:00.761 --> 27:02.794
and slowly started
walking towards me

27:02.796 --> 27:04.463
and then suddenly turned
back to the mirror

27:04.465 --> 27:06.031
right before
you fell down.

27:26.053 --> 27:29.821
¶¶

27:29.823 --> 27:31.356
Yes, you did.
It really scared me.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.492
-Was he walking to you?
-I felt really intimidated.

27:33.494 --> 27:34.626
You did do that.

27:34.628 --> 27:36.662
She started feeling
a pain on her neck,

27:36.664 --> 27:38.764
and she got the red
mark on her neck.

27:38.766 --> 27:42.167
AARON: Yeah.
That's crazy. Whoa.

27:42.169 --> 27:43.335
Come on.
Stay here with them.

27:43.337 --> 27:44.603
-Whoa.
-Aaron, go with me.

27:44.605 --> 27:45.971
Okay.

27:45.973 --> 27:52.077
¶¶

27:52.079 --> 27:58.216
¶¶

27:58.218 --> 28:01.019
What are you?

28:01.021 --> 28:04.656
Let me feel what you
just did to Sebastian.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.992
Let me see you.

28:06.994 --> 28:10.062
Show yourself to me!

28:10.064 --> 28:12.331
Let me see what you did!

28:12.333 --> 28:19.237
¶¶

28:19.239 --> 28:21.073
I don't fear you.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.680
Show yourself to me.

28:31.952 --> 28:32.951
Oh! Oh.
-What?

28:32.953 --> 28:36.622
What happened?
Are you all right?

28:36.624 --> 28:38.523
Sit down.
Sit down.

28:38.525 --> 28:40.993
You're freezing cold,
dude.

28:40.995 --> 28:42.527
Just sit down
before you fall.

28:42.529 --> 28:44.496
Just sit.

28:44.498 --> 28:48.834
¶¶

28:48.836 --> 28:50.836
Did you see that?

28:50.838 --> 28:54.673
¶¶

28:54.675 --> 28:56.875
Okay, dude.
Smoke.

28:56.877 --> 28:59.177
All of a sudden, right after
I look into the mirror,

28:59.179 --> 29:01.213
and my own reflection
begins to morph

29:01.215 --> 29:03.081
into a face that is not mine,

29:03.083 --> 29:06.451
I jump back and see a black
smoke right above the mirror,

29:06.453 --> 29:09.287
and if you watch this
X camera very closely,

29:09.289 --> 29:11.790
we capture exactly
what I'm seeing,

29:11.792 --> 29:16.161
but the infrared on-camera light
has turned the smoke white.

29:16.163 --> 29:20.465
We cannot debunk this at all, as
no light fixtures are burning,

29:20.467 --> 29:23.168
and no electrical wires
are malfunctioning.

29:25.272 --> 29:28.640
It's almost as if the spirits
are making things happen here

29:28.642 --> 29:29.941
to get everybody out.

29:29.943 --> 29:31.610
Sebastian and them are out.

29:31.612 --> 29:33.512
They marked her, got him.

29:33.514 --> 29:34.813
He's out.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.481
Zak's being infected
because it's his museum.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.518
He's running around in here
just doing, like, weird stuff.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.721
What we don't know is what
we're capturing right now.

29:42.723 --> 29:46.224
What's that?
Oh, it's Zak.

29:46.226 --> 29:48.827
I was just talking about how the
weirdness is starting to happen.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.063
-Zak! Zak!
-What?

29:51.065 --> 29:52.164
ISIBELLA: The other guy has got
scratches on him,

29:52.166 --> 29:53.732
now, too, the camera guy.

29:53.734 --> 29:55.534
-Oh, my God, Dakota.
-He's been standing there.

30:00.441 --> 30:03.642
ISIBELLA: I swear to God,
the same thing.

30:03.644 --> 30:05.310
I see it as two
running parallel down.

30:05.312 --> 30:06.712
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

30:06.714 --> 30:08.413
I was like, "Has anything
like this ever happened to you?"

30:08.415 --> 30:09.915
He's like, "My neck hurts."

30:09.917 --> 30:11.083
He never touched it.

30:11.085 --> 30:12.184
I was there the whole time,
watching him.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.719
He was like,
"My neck really hurts."

30:13.721 --> 30:14.953
And I was like, "Do you
want me to check it for you?"

30:14.955 --> 30:16.221
And he's like,
"No. No. It's fine."

30:16.223 --> 30:17.989
I was like, "Let me just
check it," and it was there.

30:17.991 --> 30:21.526
I could see it, two marks.

30:21.528 --> 30:22.627
ZAK: What is in this room?

30:22.629 --> 30:24.796
BILLY: Has anyone seen Jay?
He's gone.

30:31.326 --> 30:36.062
¶¶

30:36.064 --> 30:39.298
ZAK: It's 2:30 a.m.
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

30:39.300 --> 30:42.168
and our investigation
is intensifying.

30:42.170 --> 30:45.738
All of a sudden,
our new cameraman, Dakota,

30:45.740 --> 30:49.475
who usually only helps us
film interviews, not lockdowns,

30:49.477 --> 30:51.811
begins to panic
as scratch marks

30:51.813 --> 30:53.679
suddenly manifest
on his neck.

30:53.681 --> 30:56.115
Yeah.
It was really scary.

30:56.117 --> 30:57.517
ZAK: You don't have, like, old
scars on your neck, do you?

30:57.519 --> 30:59.652
No. No.

30:59.654 --> 31:00.720
I don't have any scars or
anything anywhere on my body.

31:00.722 --> 31:01.954
I don't even feel,
like, burning.

31:01.956 --> 31:05.224
I just feel, like, pain,
like, a normal neck pain.

31:05.226 --> 31:07.727
ZAK: It isn't until Isibella
tells Dakota

31:07.729 --> 31:11.464
about the mark on her neck
that he begins feeling neck pain

31:11.466 --> 31:14.166
and reveals these
unexplained claw marks.

31:14.168 --> 31:17.403
When we take Dakota back inside,
he starts freaking out,

31:17.405 --> 31:19.438
as he feels these
marks start to go

31:19.440 --> 31:21.307
all the way down his back.

31:25.813 --> 31:27.146
-No.
-No, no, no, no, no.

31:27.148 --> 31:29.215
-It's weird, though.
-This is a straight-up scratch.

31:29.217 --> 31:30.750
-What the...
-All right.

31:30.752 --> 31:33.386
ZAK: Right now
we are documenting

31:33.388 --> 31:37.123
some really, really serious,
serious bad scratches

31:37.125 --> 31:38.624
on our cameraman.

31:38.626 --> 31:39.926
What does it look like?
Is it, like...

31:39.928 --> 31:41.327
-Dude, hold on.
-Dude.

31:41.329 --> 31:42.461
-Oh, God.
-Dakota.

31:42.463 --> 31:43.796
ZAK: It's, like, welted.

31:43.798 --> 31:46.632
What did I tell you
at the very beginning of this?

31:46.634 --> 31:47.700
"Don't be scared."

31:47.702 --> 31:50.202
-And what did you say?
-"I'm scared."

31:50.204 --> 31:51.470
Yeah.
Yeah.

31:51.472 --> 31:52.972
ZAK: I now begin to wonder.

31:52.974 --> 31:55.908
Are these attacks being
caused by an evil entity,

31:55.910 --> 31:58.177
or is it a vampire ghost

31:58.179 --> 32:00.379
that's known to be
trapped in the mirror?

32:00.381 --> 32:03.082
Or are we overlooking
the conjuring ritual

32:03.084 --> 32:06.485
that Lady Snake, who admits
to being a dark witch,

32:06.487 --> 32:08.621
is conducting right
down the hallway?

32:08.623 --> 32:12.191
To answer this question, I ask
Patti, who is a white witch,

32:12.193 --> 32:14.160
to enter Lady Snake's room.

32:14.162 --> 32:17.830
Again, Patti has no idea
who is here with us tonight.

32:17.832 --> 32:19.131
BILLY:
Has anyone seen Jay?

32:19.133 --> 32:20.900
-What do you mean?
-He's gone.

32:20.902 --> 32:23.936
AARON: Is he in the room?
Where is he now?

32:23.938 --> 32:26.105
He was right here
a few seconds ago,

32:26.107 --> 32:27.673
and now he's gone.
-Oh.

32:27.675 --> 32:28.741
Jay?

32:28.743 --> 32:30.543
Jay?

32:30.545 --> 32:31.744
ZAK: Jay?

32:31.746 --> 32:34.447
Upon searching for Jay,
the security camera

32:34.449 --> 32:37.149
shows him going downstairs
into the basement.

32:37.151 --> 32:39.118
He then sits on the same ground

32:39.120 --> 32:42.254
where Bloody Mary did her ritual
and drops his head.

32:42.256 --> 32:46.359
Jay doesn't change this odd
pose for nearly an hour.

32:46.361 --> 32:48.928
What has Lady Snake done to him?

32:48.930 --> 32:50.997
It is now time for Patti to meet

32:50.999 --> 32:53.699
Lady Snake for
the very first time.

32:56.004 --> 32:59.438
No.
[ Laughs ]

33:02.010 --> 33:04.543
I'm here.

33:06.614 --> 33:09.348
Ah, this was the fire.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.350
Ooh.
Something's building.

33:11.352 --> 33:15.788
It's, like, red energy,
like a volcano, very much.

33:15.790 --> 33:19.225
I'm seeing, literally,
a volcano, a pot that,

33:19.227 --> 33:24.664
wah, fire energy in it.

33:24.666 --> 33:26.432
ZAK:
It quickly becomes apparent

33:26.434 --> 33:28.267
that the energy
between these two

33:28.269 --> 33:31.303
opposing forces
could be dangerous.

33:31.305 --> 33:32.905
ZAK: Lady Snake,
are you all right?

33:32.907 --> 33:34.240
Why?

33:36.611 --> 33:38.678
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.479
Lady Snake, why are
you saying that?

33:44.218 --> 33:47.219
-Be in that cauldron?
-Mm.

33:47.221 --> 33:49.655
Can I have this?

33:49.657 --> 33:51.457
No.

33:51.459 --> 33:54.760
It's mine.

33:54.762 --> 33:57.296
What you doing?

34:11.012 --> 34:12.611
ZAK: What are you feeling
right now, Lady Snake?

34:14.015 --> 34:15.681
But you've never met
this person,

34:15.683 --> 34:18.517
and you immediately wanted
to do violence to her.

34:18.519 --> 34:20.853
Yes. Yes.

34:20.855 --> 34:23.155
Why? You don't know her.

34:33.201 --> 34:35.201
Where do you
release the energy?

34:36.938 --> 34:38.604
Ahh.

34:45.146 --> 34:47.813
I know.
Mm.

34:51.519 --> 34:52.852
Can I take this?

34:56.457 --> 34:58.791
No. Okay?

34:58.793 --> 35:00.726
I don't want
to hurt you.

35:03.731 --> 35:06.198
Oh.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.500
No.

35:09.203 --> 35:11.036
You feel it?
-Okay.

35:11.038 --> 35:13.405
Let's leave.
I just...

35:13.407 --> 35:17.843
She had some visions
that came true down the hall,

35:17.845 --> 35:21.013
and I just wanted her
to come inside, here,

35:21.015 --> 35:22.515
and just to feel it.

35:22.517 --> 35:25.684
I didn't know that there was
going to be a big reaction.

35:33.361 --> 35:34.593
You don't know
who she is.

35:34.595 --> 35:35.828
She doesn't know
who you are.

35:35.830 --> 35:38.097
You two have never
met before.

35:38.099 --> 35:41.333
You had two witches meeting
together for the first time.

35:41.335 --> 35:45.371
I think that that experiment,
in and of itself,

35:45.373 --> 35:48.841
really proved the polar
opposites of an energy

35:48.843 --> 35:51.410
that you all have,
and that was instant.

35:51.412 --> 35:53.913
When I was standing
in between you two,

35:53.915 --> 35:57.583
I was just charged
with their energies

35:57.585 --> 35:59.318
hitting right
in the middle.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.886
It was so strong.

36:00.888 --> 36:02.955
ZAK:
I make the executive decision

36:02.957 --> 36:05.124
for Patti
to leave the investigation

36:05.126 --> 36:07.693
so that things
do not get worse or dangerous

36:07.695 --> 36:10.029
between her and Lady Snake.

36:10.031 --> 36:11.897
But I have to know for myself.

36:11.899 --> 36:15.801
What has this dark witch
conjured here?

36:15.803 --> 36:18.971
[ Static ]

36:18.973 --> 36:20.072
ZAK: What is in this room?

36:20.074 --> 36:23.442
AARON: A demon!
Did you hear that?

36:23.444 --> 36:24.810
A demon.

36:24.812 --> 36:27.213
ZAK: What we hear in the moment
to be a voice saying

36:27.215 --> 36:29.949
"a demon" is actually
something different

36:29.951 --> 36:31.417
when we review the footage.

36:31.419 --> 36:36.222
Listen closely, and you can hear
this deep voice say "the devil."

36:36.224 --> 36:37.489
What is in this room?

36:40.428 --> 36:43.629
If the devil is here,
could he be playing tricks on

36:43.631 --> 36:47.466
Bloody Mary by luring her closer
through this innocent doll

36:47.468 --> 36:49.034
and calling her Mama?

36:49.036 --> 36:50.836
Open your mouth.

36:53.507 --> 36:54.907
Did it say "mamma"?

36:58.946 --> 37:00.045
BLOODY MARY:
Are there spirits here

37:00.047 --> 37:01.046
that have anything to say
to us?

37:01.048 --> 37:02.381
Show us.
Show us the way.

37:02.383 --> 37:04.516
Surprise.
I'm the devil.

37:15.655 --> 37:19.056
ZAK: The dark energy
in my museum is quite active,

37:19.058 --> 37:21.225
and as I go into
the basement to check on

37:21.227 --> 37:24.061
Bloody Mary, who is working
with Cynthia,

37:24.063 --> 37:26.464
a doll that spoke to us
here in the basement

37:26.466 --> 37:29.467
during a previous
investigation...

37:29.469 --> 37:30.768
Whoa!

37:30.770 --> 37:33.504
I've just felt something
spiraling around me,

37:33.506 --> 37:34.605
and that was the coldness.

37:34.607 --> 37:36.474
It's gone now.
-It's still on me.

37:38.645 --> 37:40.044
Over there, in that corner,

37:40.046 --> 37:42.480
there, lots of dots
and electromagnetic energy

37:42.482 --> 37:44.181
dancing around
like fireflies.

37:44.183 --> 37:45.917
Hello.

37:45.919 --> 37:47.018
That's three times
I saw it.

37:47.020 --> 37:49.353
Right.
Keep walking.

37:49.355 --> 37:50.488
Knock three times
on that wall.

37:56.362 --> 37:57.962
Show us.

37:57.964 --> 38:01.499
If there is something we need
to do, let us know.

38:01.501 --> 38:04.168
If there is a message,
tell us so.

38:04.170 --> 38:06.470
[ Knocks three times ]

38:06.472 --> 38:09.607
Earlier, I was having
the candle raise and lower,

38:09.609 --> 38:12.977
raise and lower
by asking it to.

38:12.979 --> 38:14.845
What does that say?
Mad.

38:14.847 --> 38:16.847
-Mad?
-It just said "mad."

38:16.849 --> 38:17.982
Who's mad?

38:17.984 --> 38:20.918
Why are you mad.
Here. Stop being mad.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.620
-Look.
-Calm down.

38:22.622 --> 38:24.221
Did you see
it just say "mad"?

38:24.223 --> 38:27.258
-Wow.
-Why are you mad?

38:27.260 --> 38:28.859
What is your name?

-Who else is here?
-That energy is right here.

38:31.264 --> 38:33.064
-It just said "Norman."
-Norman?

38:33.066 --> 38:34.699

"What is your name?"

38:34.701 --> 38:35.700
Yeah.
Who is here?

38:35.702 --> 38:37.101
"Norman."
-And it said "Norman."

38:37.103 --> 38:38.869
-Mad Norman.
-It just said "Norman."

38:38.871 --> 38:41.238
Now it just said "puncture."
-Oh, I got cold spots.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.208
Puncture every what?

38:44.210 --> 38:46.711
Puncture every what,
Norman?

38:46.713 --> 38:50.114
ZAK: What makes this extremely
compelling and proves

38:50.116 --> 38:53.384
that the Ovilus is an accurate
communication device

38:53.386 --> 38:55.853
is that Bill Chappell,
back at nerve center,

38:55.855 --> 39:01.158
also receives the name Norman
on the Paranormal Puck 2 twice.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.193
Oh, wow.

39:02.195 --> 39:04.028
We got Norman
when that lady came up,

39:04.030 --> 39:06.097
first time,
on the Ovilus.

39:06.099 --> 39:08.099
And Norman just came up
on the Puck.

39:08.101 --> 39:10.668
The odds of receiving
the name Norman

39:10.670 --> 39:14.672
three separate times after
three separate questions

39:14.674 --> 39:16.307
are extremely high,

39:16.309 --> 39:19.276
and one of the responses
on Bill's Puck device

39:19.278 --> 39:22.046
even has a chilling
request from Norman.

39:22.048 --> 39:23.781
Now it says,
"Norman, help."

39:23.783 --> 39:25.616
It's interesting that
two different devices,

39:25.618 --> 39:27.284
now, are bringing
that same name.

Stop, Zak.
Cup.

39:34.861 --> 39:37.294
She wanted a teacup.

39:37.296 --> 39:38.362
Yeah.
She wants...

39:38.364 --> 39:39.196
We promised that
we'd give teacups.

39:39.198 --> 39:40.564
She got frustrated again.

39:40.566 --> 39:42.466
I got little chills,
and my arm's standing up on end.

39:42.468 --> 39:44.635
She said that
she wanted a teacup.

39:44.637 --> 39:47.471
Earlier, when Bloody Mary
was channeling the doll,

39:47.473 --> 39:51.008
she said that the doll
wanted a teacup set.

39:54.247 --> 39:57.848
And now, all of a sudden,
Bloody Mary becomes a bit irate

39:57.850 --> 40:00.217
because I won't
produce this for her.

40:00.219 --> 40:02.286
Just, like, what we could do,
if you said,

40:02.288 --> 40:04.088
"You know, I'm not going
to buy your tea set."

40:04.090 --> 40:05.389
I want my tea set!

40:05.391 --> 40:06.691
Zak.

40:06.693 --> 40:07.992
How do you know that
she's not something dark,

40:07.994 --> 40:10.094
Bloody Mary,
portraying all of this?

40:10.096 --> 40:11.095
Because I saw her.

40:11.097 --> 40:12.530
I saw her.
I also am a conjurer.

40:12.532 --> 40:13.564
I believe in spirit rights,

40:13.566 --> 40:14.932
and you should believe
in innocent

40:14.934 --> 40:16.534
until proven guilty,

40:16.536 --> 40:19.570
so what would it hurt
if you bought her a tea set?

40:19.572 --> 40:21.639
Would that make a demon
any more demonic?

40:21.641 --> 40:23.941
It could be a step
into something else...

40:23.943 --> 40:25.509
Why?

40:25.511 --> 40:27.111
...because now she's demanded
something that you've got.

40:27.113 --> 40:28.279
So now...
-Submission.

40:28.281 --> 40:29.847
-You're submitting.
-...to make you...

40:29.849 --> 40:31.315
Yes. I'm always
giving the offers.

40:31.317 --> 40:32.950
I gave her a cookie.
I...

40:32.952 --> 40:35.186
Right, but I don't think
every single item

40:35.188 --> 40:38.022
is angelic and great
and beautiful.

40:38.024 --> 40:40.091
I also believe that
there's negative forces

40:40.093 --> 40:41.158
in this world as well.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.493
I believe, too,
and sometimes...

40:42.495 --> 40:44.829
So I just don't open myself
up to every object.

40:44.831 --> 40:46.997
Well, I will buy her
a tea set.

40:46.999 --> 40:49.266
-That's okay.
-Someone has got to produce.

40:49.268 --> 40:53.671
So if this doll wants someone
like Bloody Mary to be its...

40:53.673 --> 40:56.674
I just want to do
something real quick.

40:56.676 --> 40:58.409
Billy, come with me.

40:58.411 --> 40:59.610
I'm coming.

40:59.612 --> 41:01.712
I feel like I just took a child
from her mother,

41:01.714 --> 41:05.149
and as I rush to put Cynthia
the doll back in her case

41:05.151 --> 41:07.451
before Bloody Mary
catches up with us,

41:07.453 --> 41:10.221
my suspicions seem
to get confirmed

41:10.223 --> 41:14.558
when the Ovilus gives us
one final disturbing message.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.194
Tell me who you are
without Bloody Mary here.

41:17.196 --> 41:20.698

41:22.668 --> 41:24.535
-What?
-"Devil."

41:24.537 --> 41:26.504
It did all this at once.
It goes "contrition."

41:26.506 --> 41:28.806
Isn't that the prayer?
-She says "surprise."

41:28.808 --> 41:31.242
And then it goes "Surprise.
I'm the devil."

41:31.244 --> 41:32.543

This building houses some
of the most haunted objects

41:42.688 --> 41:44.722
in the world.

41:44.724 --> 41:48.626
With the added influence
of these masters of the occult,

41:48.628 --> 41:51.829
we were able to confront
the dangerous presence

41:51.831 --> 41:56.367
bound within the walls
of The Haunted Museum.

41:56.369 --> 41:59.703
