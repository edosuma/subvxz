WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
[hard rock music playing]

00:21.771 --> 00:23.106
Okay, you were right.

00:23.898 --> 00:24.983
We're not talking.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.027
I'm still extremely mad at you.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.030
Fine. Then I'm still mad at you, too.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.072
Great.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.200
-Your hair looks stupid by the way.
-[gasps]

00:34.284 --> 00:35.118
Your...

00:35.827 --> 00:36.661
face looks bad.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.997
-No, it doesn't. My face rules.
-Whatever!

00:39.080 --> 00:41.332
[both growl]

00:42.709 --> 00:43.710
[tires screech]

00:48.006 --> 00:49.716
-[Debbie gasps]
-Thank the Lord!

00:49.799 --> 00:52.761
Glad you're alive, but oh, boy,
are you dead meat.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.471
Your father and I have been sick,
worried about y'all,

00:54.554 --> 00:56.848
and you did not even have
the decency to answer your cell phones!

00:56.931 --> 00:58.266
-Cell phones are a privilege!
-That is right!

00:58.349 --> 01:00.143
Mom, Dad, cut the crap.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.895
-Blair, do not sass me!
-Yeah, cut the crap!

01:01.978 --> 01:02.896
[Anderson gasps]

01:02.979 --> 01:04.397
-Sterling!
-Sterling.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.690
What has gotten into you, young lady?

01:05.774 --> 01:08.026
We know about you!
The real whole dang serious truth!

01:08.109 --> 01:10.570
Yes, and where to begin, Mom?

01:10.653 --> 01:11.529
Well, let's see.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.198
You're not from Savannah,

01:13.281 --> 01:15.200
you're from Nandina, Georgia.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.953
Where you belong to
Tabernacle Church of Christ the Reindeer--

01:19.037 --> 01:20.622
-Redeemer, Redeemer...
-Redeemer!

01:20.830 --> 01:24.167
Where you might be sad to learnÂ that
one of your childhood snakes just died.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.254
And, oh, yeah, you're wanted
for first-degree arson!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.381
That's enough, Blair! That's enough.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.176
Mom, you have to tell us the truth.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.599
All right, yes.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.522
Yes, I have not been entirely truthful
about my past.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.439
[scoffs]

01:46.523 --> 01:49.984
But it was because she--
we needed to protect you.

01:50.068 --> 01:50.902
From what?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.405
All right, girls. Just listen. It...

01:55.198 --> 01:57.075
It was a different time in my life.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.537
I was very young and impressionable

02:00.620 --> 02:02.997
and I fell in with an extreme crowd,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.167
and I acted out of hate, not love.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.877
And that is not what God intended.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.088
I can see that now.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.214
So, you did this.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.007
You set fire to an abortion clinic!

02:14.050 --> 02:15.677
That is not very Christian of you!

02:15.760 --> 02:16.594
No.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.097
But at the time,
I thought it was very Christian.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.014
[scoffs]

02:20.098 --> 02:22.016
Obviously, I was wrong.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.727
-Was anyone hurt?
-No. No.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.479
Thank the Lord. No one was hurt.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.148
This is not an excuse

02:28.606 --> 02:31.484
because we should always
take responsibility for our actions,

02:31.943 --> 02:33.736
but I was acting under the influence

02:33.820 --> 02:37.991
of some very persuasive people.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.453
They were saying, uh,
provocative things about the Lord,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.122
things that are not true

02:44.581 --> 02:45.957
knowing God the way I do now,

02:46.457 --> 02:49.002
how he forgives and loves all people.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.797
I'm ashamed I fell so far off the path.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.053
Who are these people?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.598
Were you in a cult?

03:01.973 --> 03:02.974
Why did you do it?

03:03.057 --> 03:04.142
Are people after you?

03:04.225 --> 03:05.685
Did the police question you?

03:05.768 --> 03:07.770
-Did you feel cool in the moment?
-Blair!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.189
Girls, the details are not important.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.774
What you need to know is
that from the moment we had you,

03:11.858 --> 03:13.151
we have done everything in our power

03:13.234 --> 03:16.321
to make sure that you do not wind up
like I did those many years ago.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.157
All right, we have--

03:20.742 --> 03:22.243
We have worked so hard...

03:23.578 --> 03:24.621
to give you this life.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.748
We both have.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.797
-Are you in danger?
-Are we safe?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.717
I'm not in danger and we are safe.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.970
We have a plan, and lawyers.

03:41.054 --> 03:41.888
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.390
-And everything is gonna be just fine.
-Yeah.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.938
[exhales deeply] Okay.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.189
[chuckles] Wow.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.733
Our, uh-- Our big family secret is out.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.276
-It is a lot...
-A lot.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.819
...but it's out, there it is.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.905
So, here's what we're gonna do.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.326
[sniffs]
I am gonna pack y'all some snacks to-go

04:03.409 --> 04:04.994
while you put on your PJs,

04:05.078 --> 04:07.288
and y'all are gonna go
to that lock-in tonight

04:07.372 --> 04:10.333
and enjoy being teenagers
while you still can.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.836
All right. Come on, girls, let's go.
Chop chop!

04:13.920 --> 04:14.921
Hummus and veggies?

04:15.004 --> 04:16.589
-And Oreos.
-Yeah.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.549
Oh. All right. Go, go, go.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.468
[chuckles]

04:21.302 --> 04:23.972
[theme music]

04:24.055 --> 04:26.349
[vocalizing]

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
I need cash to deposit,
our bank account is low.

05:07.140 --> 05:07.974
Why?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.727
Gas, lock-in pizza.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.644
Fine.

05:13.813 --> 05:14.647
How much?

05:15.023 --> 05:15.857
Two hundred.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.283
So...

05:27.285 --> 05:28.119
So.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.331
Mom's a wanted fugitive.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.125
Mom is a wanted fugitive, happy Friday.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.713
It's like she was living
this whole double life

05:38.796 --> 05:39.756
that we didn't know about.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.342
We can't exactly judge her.
We're living a double life, too.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.178
Putting bad guys away.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.555
She was being a bad guy.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.018
Is that lip gloss?

05:53.394 --> 05:54.228
Oh.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.481
You're really pulling out
all the stops for April.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.150
Shove it. I want to look nice tonight,
in general.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.319
You're not gonna bail, right?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.697
I kind of need you there
with the whole me and April situation,

06:04.781 --> 06:06.657
for, like, moral support.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.744
Bailing is your thing, not mine.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.206
[cell phones bleep]

06:23.716 --> 06:25.176
Is he even here?

06:26.135 --> 06:28.763
-Girls.
-Bowser, what's happening?

06:28.846 --> 06:30.515
No offense, but we're slammed.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.350
I have 30 pizzas that are about to go live

06:32.433 --> 06:33.684
and I gotta be there when they land.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.771
Why do y'all work for me?

06:37.730 --> 06:38.731
Uh...

06:38.815 --> 06:41.025
You said you needed money
to fix your daddy's truck.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.903
You got that taken care of weeks ago.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.447
Yeah.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.455
-[Bowser] Hm?
-Wait! No, Bowser, that's not--

06:54.539 --> 06:55.873
It's, like, not what you think.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.583
How could you have known this whole time,

06:57.667 --> 07:00.670
and not told me that
your mama was some nutjob fugitive?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.256
Is that why you got in this business
in the first place, hm?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.174
To learn how to help somebody
evade the law?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.135
No, we didn't know, we promise.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.011
We just found out, like, today.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.555
Yeah, and our mom is not a nutjob.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.598
She only made a mistake,
like, a long time ago.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.184
How am I supposed to believe you?
You're a couple of liars.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.352
That is a nasty allegation.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.520
Never to you, Bowser.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.314
Really?

07:21.315 --> 07:22.358
[exhales deeply]

07:22.442 --> 07:24.068
Your folks came to see me yesterday,

07:24.152 --> 07:25.278
looking for you two.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.822
Lyin' is bad.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.408
But lying to your family...

07:32.243 --> 07:33.202
that's unforgivable.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.662
No, but we only skipped school

07:34.745 --> 07:36.497
so that we could figure out
what's going on with our mom.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.749
We swear we didn't know about her before.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.668
I ain't got time for all your excuses.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.546
This shit done got too complicated
with the two of you.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.716
Now I'm playing boss
and babysitter and bestie, apparently.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.386
You didn't have to answer my call today.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.971
I know I didn't have to.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.724
I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming myself.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.145
Running with y'all got me soft.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.481
So soft, I threw a skip.

08:02.106 --> 08:06.235
It reminded me why
I only look out for myself, and that's it!

08:06.319 --> 08:09.780
Well, I think
that's a really shitty approach to life.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.991
[Bowser] Yeah, well,
why don't you finish high school

08:12.074 --> 08:13.910
before you talk to me about life?

08:14.827 --> 08:15.661
Hm?

08:17.914 --> 08:18.748
You're fired.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.876
-We're fired?
-Mm-hm.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.004
Just because we're, like,
friends with you?

08:25.087 --> 08:26.464
No! You're fired because

08:26.547 --> 08:29.091
I should have never got involved with you
in the first place!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.844
A couple of kids in pajamas, even.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.847
I was doing just fine.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.935
And you came in
and you convinced me to change things.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.186
You mean be happy?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.103
Happy?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.356
Do I look happy to you, right now?

08:44.148 --> 08:44.982
No.

08:45.066 --> 08:45.900
No.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.278
And the mochi on the motherfucking
non-fat yogurt sundae...

08:50.696 --> 08:54.700
Now, I know the whereabouts
of a wanted fugitive.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.077
You're not gonna turn our mom in, are you?

08:57.787 --> 08:58.663
No.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.831
I'm not going to turn her in.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.084
Because of you!

09:04.085 --> 09:06.504
Because you put me
in an impossible situation here.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.258
So, now I'm forced to forgo my ethics

09:10.716 --> 09:12.677
and leave 90,000 dollars on the table.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.595
So, yeah, sorry, girls.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
I'm gonna need you to get up out of here.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.809
Now!

09:31.070 --> 09:32.238
[Blair sighs]

09:33.614 --> 09:34.448
Are you okay?

09:36.117 --> 09:36.951
Yeah.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.078
Just, you know...

09:40.955 --> 09:41.956
rejected.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.332
Again.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.759
I've been thinking about
what you said in Nandina.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.680
About me creating drama, or whatever.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.391
I'm sorry I said all that stuff, Blair,
but you said mean stuff, too.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.352
That you have blonde hair
and that you're gonna go to UGA?

10:03.686 --> 10:04.520
Yeah.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.897
Whoo. How will you ever forgive me?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.107
You said I was boring.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.193
You were harsh and you know it.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.528
Well, I was pissed, okay?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.118
But what sucks and makes me want to...

10:19.702 --> 10:21.329
punch you in the face, lightly...

10:23.164 --> 10:24.582
is that, uh...

10:28.753 --> 10:30.129
I think you're kinda right.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.343
I'd rather...

10:37.011 --> 10:39.180
stir things up, so...

10:40.514 --> 10:43.100
life feels bad because of my actions,

10:45.227 --> 10:46.187
rather than...

10:49.815 --> 10:52.943
just life... feeling bad.

10:55.029 --> 10:59.533
And I want to want
to go with you to the lock-in, but...

11:01.160 --> 11:02.411
I just don't.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.874
I want to be with Miles.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.754
I think I love him.

11:13.089 --> 11:13.964
Oh.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.259
Blair, it's gonna be really hard,

11:18.052 --> 11:20.304
and it's gonna take some time,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.099
but you're gonna get over it.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.183
Like I did with Luke.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.895
I don't love him the way you loved Luke.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.567
I love him the way Luke loves you.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.279
Oh. Um...

11:39.073 --> 11:39.949
Wow.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.742
That's the real deal.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.704
Yeah.

11:47.665 --> 11:52.378
Is it for you with... April?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.255
I don't know.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.424
It could be.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.385
[chuckles]
Soon you'll be scissoring our enemy.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.721
Girls don't actually scissor each other.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.097
What do they do?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.224
I don't know, but I guess I'll find out.

12:07.351 --> 12:11.230
You know I don't care
if you're, like, gay, or whatever.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.023
I'm more undefined than that.

12:13.816 --> 12:14.650
Like...

12:15.860 --> 12:17.987
if sexuality was a color wheel,

12:18.237 --> 12:23.284
I'd be in the blue-pink-purple part.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.994
I said, "Or whatever."

12:25.077 --> 12:27.037
You could bang a ficus, for all I care,

12:27.121 --> 12:29.832
just don't hide stuff.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.543
-Twin swear.
-Twin swear.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.588
Okay. [sniffs]

12:37.214 --> 12:38.924
[exhales deeply] Time to go get your girl.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.676
Time to get yours-- boy.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.511
No...  [sighs] ...Sterling.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.807
[sighs] He dumped me.
I'm not gonna go to him.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.100
You love him, right?

12:48.559 --> 12:51.896
Like, the full, real,
sick to your stomach kind of love?

12:51.979 --> 12:55.441
Yeah. Like--
Like I want to throw up all the time.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.234
Then you've gotta tell him how you feel.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.278
Okay? Life is too short to love in secret.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.489
"The truth will set you free."

13:02.031 --> 13:03.449
Oh, no, no.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.951
Love has made you too cheesy.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.879
Drive safe. Don't get pulled over,

13:16.962 --> 13:19.465
and call the second
you get across the border.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.183
[tires screech]

13:29.725 --> 13:32.186
-[Blair] Good luck!
-You, too. Bye!

13:42.905 --> 13:43.781
Oh!

13:43.864 --> 13:46.242
Thank the high, beautiful Heavens
you are here, Sterling.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.538
[groans] Coach Esposito has athlete's foot
running up and down both his legs,

13:50.621 --> 13:51.789
so I'm flying solo.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.165
People showed up early,

13:53.249 --> 13:54.917
April texted me that she's running late,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.710
and now Hannah B and Ezequiel

13:56.794 --> 13:59.004
are having a little bit
of a power struggle.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.339
What for?

14:00.422 --> 14:02.925
Over whether we're watching
Prince of Egypt

14:03.008 --> 14:05.052
or Davey and Goliath's
Snowboard Christmas.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.137
I prefer Prince of Egypt myself,

14:07.221 --> 14:09.098
so I can save Davey and Goliath
for the holidays with my nana,

14:09.181 --> 14:11.475
but I have been getting emails
from parents

14:11.559 --> 14:13.310
who are concerned that this lock-in

14:13.394 --> 14:15.688
is gonna promote sexual activity.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.524
And that animated Moses,

14:18.607 --> 14:22.194
I mean, he certainly promotes
something deep within, right?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.613
With the dark hair and the bronze calves,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.574
so I don't know what to do.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.741
It's your call.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.869
Um...

14:29.952 --> 14:31.787
-Prince of Egypt.
-Okay.

14:32.037 --> 14:35.624
Yes. Because I had a hard time
really believing

14:35.708 --> 14:39.336
that you kids would ever
be thinking about sexual activity

14:39.420 --> 14:41.839
at an innocent event
like an overnight lock-in.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.008
[all chattering]

14:48.888 --> 14:50.472
-Hi.
-Hey.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.473
Look, see?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.726
This is just good, clean fun.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.229
Um, I'm gonna double check
and see if the scavenger hunt clues

14:57.313 --> 14:58.689
-are all in the right places.
-Okay.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.065
[Sterling] I'll be back in a few.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.614
Oh, wow.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.365
I love your PJs, Lorna.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.369
Hi.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.746
Well, there you are.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.665
-Sorry, family stuff.
-Okay.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.501
Willingham students,

15:19.585 --> 15:22.171
welcome to the 12th annual

15:22.254 --> 15:24.715
Willingham Academy overnight lock-in!

15:24.798 --> 15:26.675
[all cheer]

15:28.260 --> 15:30.095
Now, I'm excited to announce

15:30.638 --> 15:34.642
that the doors are officially locked
from the inside.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.272
-Fire! Fire!
-[girl] Where?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.858
[muffled giggling]

15:42.942 --> 15:43.943
I got you guys.

15:44.026 --> 15:44.902
I'm just kiddin'!

15:44.985 --> 15:46.987
-[students groan]
-Oh, I love y'all.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.366
[cell phone rings]

15:52.034 --> 15:52.868
Hello.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.995
-Hey, when you gonna get here?
-[rock music playing]

15:55.079 --> 15:56.121
An hour.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.247
Okay.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.416
Vamos, amiga.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.542
Okay.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.586
[disconnects call]

16:09.802 --> 16:11.595
[tapping on cell phone]

16:11.679 --> 16:13.806
Lock-in pizza, get it while it's hot.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.142
[chuckles]

16:34.827 --> 16:37.830
[Hanna B] The movie should start at 11
when people have finished their pizza.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.289
And what will they do while they eat?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.500
Listen to all the chewing,
stare into each other's eyeballs?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.460
Maybe they'll have
meaningful conversations

16:43.544 --> 16:45.170
with their friends, Ezequiel.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.630
I wouldn't know what that's like.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.549
Hey, guys. Have you seen April?

16:48.632 --> 16:50.384
Uh, she snagged the good sleeping corner.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.885
Typically, seniors get that.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.178
She must have pulled some strings.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.850
-So, the movie's gonna start at 11:00.
-[groans]

16:57.933 --> 16:59.852
We're going to have
a little bit of prayer time.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.812
I saw you guys on the Twister mat earlier.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.440
You are very flexible.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.066
[people chattering]

17:06.150 --> 17:07.651
[April] You have to be careful, though.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.944
Twister is the devil's doorway.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.655
Hey, April. I thought
you were gonna save me a spot.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.241
Really? I don't remember that.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.159
What?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.746
Uh... No, remember you were--
you were gonna save me a spot

17:18.829 --> 17:20.748
because we were gonna hang out tonight?

17:22.833 --> 17:24.168
You must be thinking of someone else.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.714
-[chuckles]
-Hey!

17:28.797 --> 17:29.631
Hi.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.425
[Luke] Oh, hey, Sterling.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.802
Do you like my guitar-shaped sleeping bag?

17:34.094 --> 17:36.805
I love your sleeping bag, Luke.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.515
I think it's just...

17:39.558 --> 17:40.392
fascinating.

17:40.976 --> 17:41.977
[Luke] Wow, thanks.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.353
It was really expensive,

17:43.437 --> 17:45.147
and it's super small and hard to get into.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.108
I tried to zip it up earlier,
but it couldn't get past my quads.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.486
"Do, or do not."

17:51.195 --> 17:53.197
"There is no try."

17:53.614 --> 17:54.531
[both laugh]

17:54.615 --> 17:56.241
April, I need to speak to you, right now!

17:56.325 --> 17:58.786
It's about the-- the scavenger hunt.
There's a clue missing.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.622
I'm sure it'll work itself out.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.667
Got it.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.136
[doorbell rings]

[bluesy jazz music playing]

18:17.679 --> 18:18.680
May I help you, Miss?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.099
I need to speak with Miles.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.726
My apologies, but Mr. Taylor's
enjoying dinner with his family.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.228
Would you mind waiting
in the formal tea room

18:24.311 --> 18:25.145
until the meal is complete?

18:25.229 --> 18:28.065
Actually... uh, I do. Sorry!

18:30.901 --> 18:33.278
Hi... uh, dining room, please.
I need to speak with Miles.

18:33.362 --> 18:37.199
Well, my apologies, but Mister Taylor
is enjoying dinner with his family.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.660
Would you mind waiting
in the guest living room--

18:39.743 --> 18:40.953
Again, I do.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.998
-[woman] Oh.
-Miles--

18:46.834 --> 18:48.043
Uh...

18:48.127 --> 18:50.337
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.090
I have heard such good things
about you all.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.093
And I hate
to interrupt this lovely spread,

18:56.176 --> 18:58.679
but I need to talk to Miles.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.681
Blair, what the hell?

19:01.807 --> 19:02.975
Please come outside.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.685
No, Blair.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.022
Then, I'm gonna say it all here,

19:09.106 --> 19:10.065
[Miles sighs]

19:10.149 --> 19:11.150
in front of everyone.

19:12.609 --> 19:16.363
Miles, this whole boyfriend thing
is new to me.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.367
And I have realized
that I don't totally deserve you...

19:21.201 --> 19:24.413
because you are more thoughtful than me,

19:25.414 --> 19:27.666
kinder... more patient,

19:29.001 --> 19:29.835
but...

19:31.879 --> 19:33.463
I feel like I belong with you.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.677
And I would kick myself
every day in the butthole

19:38.760 --> 19:40.179
if I didn't tell you that--

19:41.889 --> 19:42.973
I love you, Miles.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.519
And I think that you love me, too.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.732
Miles, who is this?

19:59.114 --> 20:01.116
You didn't tell them about me?

20:04.828 --> 20:05.746
[sniffs]

20:06.663 --> 20:08.165
Sorry to have interrupted you.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.172
[Miles sighs]

20:16.715 --> 20:17.591
Hey, Blair.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.385
Blair!

20:22.512 --> 20:23.639
Blair, stop!

20:23.722 --> 20:26.183
No, I'm good. I'm nobody, anyway.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.476
Well, look, I'm sorry.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.102
I am sorry.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.104
What do you want?

20:31.647 --> 20:32.981
My mom is mid-campaign.

20:34.024 --> 20:34.942
And--

20:35.025 --> 20:35.859
[sighs]

20:36.485 --> 20:38.987
All right. You're the daughter
of white Republicans.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.405
Wow.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.159
All this time,
when I was ashamed of myself,

20:44.409 --> 20:46.745
it turns out you were ashamed of me, too.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.538
No, I wasn't. Uh...

20:49.164 --> 20:50.540
It's got to fit in with my family.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.461
I know I wasn't...

20:55.879 --> 20:57.589
really easy to be with all the time,

20:58.840 --> 21:00.884
but I came here tonight

21:00.968 --> 21:03.553
because I wanted to change for you.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.767
Because I thought that I loved you.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.560
Listen, Blair...

21:11.853 --> 21:13.355
you think you want this,

21:14.022 --> 21:15.732
but you can't really know what you want.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.277
Not until you know who you are.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.988
You don't know what I want.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.658
And I know who I am.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.161

gonna get to experience

that I'm gonna get to do in this world.

that the scavenger hunt's over?

even more exciting than the actual event.

Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.376
Why don't you throw in that playlist

22:16.460 --> 22:17.836

22:17.919 --> 22:18.795
Hm?

My fingers are crossed there's
some Good Charlotte on there

[Sterling sighs]

24:28.967 --> 24:30.010
I don't get you.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.678
What changed?

24:33.054 --> 24:34.222
I changed my mind.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.266
It's allowed.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.811
But I thought we--

24:42.898 --> 24:43.857
[gasps]

24:46.985 --> 24:48.612
As long as my dad is my dad,

24:49.070 --> 24:52.574
I can't be all, you know, "out there,"
sexually speaking.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.536
I'm not asking you
to headline a gay pride parade.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.331
I'm asking you to hold
my hand at the lock-in.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.957
He would never even know.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.876
Rumors travel fast.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.794
To prison?

25:07.422 --> 25:08.757
He got cleared of his charges.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.929
He's home...

25:14.513 --> 25:17.933
and surprise, surprise,
he's not a big fan of the gays.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.646
I have to focus on my family, Sterling.
Why don't you understand that?

25:23.813 --> 25:25.732
He's... He's out?

25:27.317 --> 25:29.236
He's got a lot of stuff
he wants to explain.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.863
And he wants to...

25:32.989 --> 25:33.949
reconnect.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.118
He asked about you and Blair,

25:37.702 --> 25:39.496
which was so random

25:39.579 --> 25:42.082
considering we've been
sworn enemies since the fifth grade,

25:42.165 --> 25:44.501
but it made me so freaked out
that he heard something already.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.505
But I was probably just being paranoid.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.633
Oh.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.514
Maybe someday, though?

25:58.848 --> 25:59.683
Maybe.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.646
Actually, I don't know.

26:13.863 --> 26:14.698
Bye, Sterl.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.748
[sobs]

26:23.832 --> 26:25.542
There will be other boys.

26:29.713 --> 26:32.549
I love him, but now I hate him.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.345
It's like my head and my heart
are at chemical warfare.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.139
[chuckles]

26:39.222 --> 26:42.183
I know, sweetie. I know. I know. I know.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.397
I don't want to eat nachos anymore.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.357
-Well, can I have some?
-Yeah.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.567
Okay.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.653
[cell phone bleeps]

26:57.907 --> 26:58.783
Hey.

27:01.077 --> 27:01.953
Luke.

27:02.037 --> 27:02.912
Hi, Sterling.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.748
I don't mean to pry or anything,

27:04.831 --> 27:07.250
but I saw you through the window.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.711
It looked like you might be crying.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.296
Oh, that's sweet.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.008
I guess I am crying.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.009
Um...

27:16.092 --> 27:16.968
I'm fine.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.595
I've just got a lot going on right now.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.971
You don't have to tell me.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.765
Just know that I'm here for you.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.059
As a friend.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.896
Luke is patient, Luke is kind...

27:30.231 --> 27:31.316
What's in your hair?

27:32.609 --> 27:33.485
Oh.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.071
I was trying to do a man bun,

27:36.154 --> 27:38.615
but, uh, my hair's not long enough,

27:39.532 --> 27:40.992
so it's more like a high pony.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.410
[chuckles]

27:42.494 --> 27:46.039
It's my last hurrah
before I start golf again on Monday.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.540
Yeah? You're back on the team?

27:48.249 --> 27:50.251
My brother, and my dad, and my grandfather

27:50.335 --> 27:52.087
had an intervention for me last weekend.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.881
Surprise dropÂ at the Bobby Jones
fairway bunker

27:54.964 --> 27:55.924
with a wedge after church.

27:56.549 --> 27:59.052
Perfect approach, straight onto the green.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.180
I'm so good at golf.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.558
But Franklin's gonna stay captain

28:05.642 --> 28:07.477
-since he's still a virgin and all...
-Mm.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.271
...but he couldn't deny that
The Crusaders need me on the team.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.857
So, no more guitar?

28:13.149 --> 28:15.235
Oh, no-- [chuckles]

28:15.318 --> 28:16.569
I plan to keep shreddin'.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.155
Just privately.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.115
Cool.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.368
[sighs]

28:23.451 --> 28:25.620
So, you're becoming friends
with April, huh?

28:28.081 --> 28:28.998
I guess so.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.669
She was really nice to me
at school the other day.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.588
And I thought about how you said

28:35.672 --> 28:38.007
we were together just
because of circumstance.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.886
And I was wondering,

28:41.970 --> 28:43.513
do you think it'd be okay if I...

28:44.305 --> 28:45.390
if I asked her out?

28:47.642 --> 28:50.228
Just to test out another circumstance.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.105
Oh, um...

28:53.314 --> 28:54.357
Yeah, you should--

28:57.485 --> 28:58.820
You should do what you want.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.406
I bet she says yes.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.117
I know you two don't get along.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.120
But I really do think
if you gave her a shot,

29:07.203 --> 29:08.371
you might be surprised.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.040
People change, Sterl.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.794
But they also change back.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.758
[sighs] I really miss you, Luke.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.552
Things with you were so easy.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.849
[sighs] Yeah, I mi-- I miss...

29:29.017 --> 29:30.185
I miss you a lot, too.

-Mom.

Oh. Found you.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.699

29:45.492 --> 29:46.326
Come on, get in.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.579
Text me later, maybe.

29:50.038 --> 29:50.914
Okay, maybe.

29:50.997 --> 29:51.831
Okay.

Hey, Mom.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.968

30:05.637 --> 30:09.182

30:09.265 --> 30:10.391

30:10.475 --> 30:11.518
Well, I'm really glad you're here

one of the worst nights

-Yeah, Luke.

I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to be sad.

Well, can I hug you?

30:27.659 --> 30:28.660
Yeah, Mom.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.961
[sniffs]
Hey, I'm gonna go pick up Sterling.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.379
She's having a bad night

30:39.462 --> 30:40.797
and she doesn't want to stay
at the lock-in.

30:44.133 --> 30:44.968
Wait.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.637
She says she's with you.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.391
She said that? That she's with me?

Yeah.

Alright, while ago I did something
a lot of people didn't like.

But I-- you know,
I still think it's the right thing.

33:37.306 --> 33:40.560
But we knew the police would not agree,

33:40.643 --> 33:43.021
so I've had to lay low.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.647
So, you're, like, a criminal?

33:46.649 --> 33:47.483
Why do you smoke?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.736
You know smoking is,Â like,
really bad for you, right?

33:50.737 --> 33:53.156
And Dana was the one
that set fire to that abortion clinic.

33:53.239 --> 33:56.451
And now, we have helped her out
here and there over the years,

33:56.534 --> 33:59.370
but lately she--
she's been threatening us for more,

33:59.620 --> 34:01.164
which we don't have.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.999
So, we're trying to get rid of her.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.084
You were trying to kill her?

34:05.168 --> 34:06.669
Oh, Lord, Blair, no.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.546
We wanted her to get out of the country.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.215

or what she's doing with her.

wanted. No one ever told you no, huh?

35:14.987 --> 35:15.863
All right.

35:16.948 --> 35:17.824
Just...

35:19.659 --> 35:21.577
Just trust me, okay?

35:22.203 --> 35:24.163
You do exactly as I say...

35:26.916 --> 35:28.584
and everything will be just fine.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.337
My suspicions were correct.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.713
You were lying!

35:32.797 --> 35:35.383
You know, this is very traumatic,

35:35.466 --> 35:37.760
making me not trust my own instincts.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.139
-I am going to be in therapy for years!
-Okay, Blair.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.015
I'm gonna have to take a gap year,
at least!

35:45.768 --> 35:48.396
Okay, I know that it's very important
to find Sterling right now,

35:48.771 --> 35:50.314
but please don't forget,

35:50.690 --> 35:53.234
-I'm really super mad at you.
-Okay.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.944
No, we won't, we won't, we won't. Um...

35:55.486 --> 35:57.905
Debbie, just keep trying Dana
and I'm gonna try Sterling, okay.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.032
I am. Goshdang it,
she's still not picking up.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.409
I think we need to call the police.

36:02.702 --> 36:03.578
-But--
-No.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.371
There's no "buts." I'm calling the police.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.289
Wait, Anderson--

36:06.372 --> 36:07.498
Sterling is our daughter

36:07.582 --> 36:09.458
and I am calling the goddamn police!

36:12.795 --> 36:13.629
Okay.

36:26.142 --> 36:26.976
Hey.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.312
What are you doing here so late?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.272
You don't need it anymore?

36:32.481 --> 36:33.524
Do you want to come in?

36:33.608 --> 36:35.109
No, no. Here.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.946
Going out of town for a little bit.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.281
Maybe a while.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.116
Going where?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.117
Down to Florida.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.078
I reconnected with Tim, and Jordy,

36:46.162 --> 36:47.580
and D. Brad, and those guys.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.458
They got a couple of skips
I brought in before,

36:50.541 --> 36:51.500
they could use my help.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.546
-You know you left Florida for a reason.
-Yeah.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.716
What about Yogurtopia?

36:58.799 --> 37:00.384
I'm letting Miss Cathy take over.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.595
Yeah, she damn near fainted
when I told her,

37:02.678 --> 37:04.138
or she was just really tired.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.434
Are you coming back... to Atlanta?

37:09.602 --> 37:11.729
Just feel like
there isn't much here for me now.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.731
[scoffs] Guess I'm just chopped liver?

37:15.816 --> 37:16.943
You're with someone else.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.448
So, what? You're leaving?

37:22.907 --> 37:24.200
Because you got your feelings hurt?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.744
I thought we were friends.

37:26.827 --> 37:27.870
Ah, look, here...

37:28.621 --> 37:32.124
I'm leaving because
it's feeling like a dead end.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.877
What about your team?

37:34.961 --> 37:36.420
My teenage white saviors?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.339
Yeah, they're kind of your family now.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.383
They are not my family, okay?

37:40.466 --> 37:42.510
They're little girls
with attitude problems.

37:43.803 --> 37:44.929
Actually, that's just Blair,

37:45.012 --> 37:48.766
but they're annoying
and they ask too many questions,

37:48.849 --> 37:51.060
and they talk with their mouths full.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.645
If I have to listen to one more--

37:52.728 --> 37:54.313
[cell phone rings]

37:57.149 --> 37:57.984
Hello.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.319
[cell phone buzzes]

38:01.237 --> 38:02.363
[sighs] Shit.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.449
Hey. Got held up, but I'm on my way.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.867
-[Levi] You almost here?
-Yes.

38:06.951 --> 38:07.868
We gotta go!

38:07.952 --> 38:09.662
Yes, yes, yes, just be patient, baby.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.085
Hey, can we pull up at this rest stop?
I gotta pee real bad.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.753
No, don't have time. Hold it.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.130
Okay, I would hold it,

38:19.213 --> 38:22.133
but there's this guy, Declan Wright,
in Blair's study hall

38:22.216 --> 38:24.719
who held his pee
and his testicle exploded,

38:24.802 --> 38:27.430
which is weird because
urine is in the bladder,

38:27.513 --> 38:28.723
but that's what the doctor said.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.599
If you hold your pee
for a really long time

38:30.683 --> 38:31.934
your bladder actually expands,

38:32.018 --> 38:33.811
which at first sounds like
it would be a good thing

38:33.894 --> 38:35.896
because it's like, you know,
a greater surface area,

38:35.980 --> 38:38.316
greater ability to house a larger volume,

38:38.399 --> 38:41.068
but in actuality, it's, um-- uh...

38:41.652 --> 38:42.695
[Dana clears throat]

38:45.656 --> 38:47.074
Jeez, you're just like my mom.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.244
Okay, we're pulling over.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.925
Hey. Stay close, Muffin.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.975
Whoa. What the hell are you doing?
I thought you had to piss.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.143
[machine beeps]

39:14.226 --> 39:15.895
Oh, I do, but I'm also starving.

39:15.978 --> 39:18.397
It's been two hours since I ate
and I'm growing like a weed. [chuckles]

39:18.481 --> 39:20.191
I gotta have a snack,
something Sour Patch.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.568
That shit's disgusting.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.744
You know kids and their candy. [giggles]

39:33.871 --> 39:35.998
[sighs]
My mom would never let me get this much.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.876
Thank you, so much, Mom's sister.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.544
Aunt Dana. [chuckles]

39:40.628 --> 39:41.712
You're the best!

39:42.755 --> 39:44.173
-Thank you.
-Oh, yeah, well.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.175
Sure.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.374
[breathing deeply]

40:28.551 --> 40:31.262
Dear Lord, what up? It's me, again.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.390
I'm really scared right now,

40:34.473 --> 40:35.891
but I know you have a plan.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.143
[breathing deeply]

40:37.226 --> 40:40.479
Please help keep me
and the people I love safe.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.107
Please help me be brave.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.151
Please help me kick butt.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.029
And then, something for later,

40:49.447 --> 40:51.407
when I'm not being kidnapped anymore.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.202
Please help DanaÂ figure out

40:55.703 --> 40:58.831
how to have a peaceful, more happy life.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.375
It seems like she's got a lot of,Â like...

41:02.376 --> 41:03.419
problems.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.005
Okay.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.089
I think that's it.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.341
[exhales deeply] Amen.

41:10.092 --> 41:10.926
[sniffs]

41:11.302 --> 41:12.136
-Hey!
-[pounding]

41:13.012 --> 41:13.929
Come on.

41:14.263 --> 41:15.264
You done pissin'?

41:15.556 --> 41:17.475
Don't forget to wipe-- front to back.
All right?

41:18.058 --> 41:18.893
Come on.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.480
Oh, right. Uh, good idea. Wiping now.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.693
And she's been missing
for less than an hour?

41:28.152 --> 41:30.779
-[Debbie] Yes.
-Someone picked her up at the school

41:30.863 --> 41:33.032
in a gray pickup truck,

41:33.115 --> 41:37.036
uh, license plate GT9684J.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.829
-And how do you know that?
-It's our car.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.125
Do you have any ideas
about the person in question?

41:43.209 --> 41:45.252
Well, yes.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.670
It's her aunt.

41:48.714 --> 41:52.635
So, her aunt picked her up at school
in the family vehicle?

41:54.094 --> 41:55.554
I'm sorry, is there any reason to believe

41:55.638 --> 41:57.765
that this family member
is a danger to your daughter?

41:57.848 --> 41:58.682
Yes.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.143
[officer] Okay, what is it?

42:01.227 --> 42:03.437
Oh, um... You-- n-- n--

42:03.979 --> 42:06.273
-N-- Nothing specific comes to mind.
-[cell phone bleeps]

42:06.357 --> 42:09.652
[Anderson] Ju-- Just generally
kind of a bad influence.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.279
[Blair]
The text message came in at 10:32 p.m..

42:12.363 --> 42:14.490
The school is 1.2 miles northeast of here

42:14.573 --> 42:16.784
and based on the truck's
Peach Pass time stamps,

42:16.867 --> 42:19.662
they're heading southwest
of Atlanta on I-85.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.206
My guess is that they have
a 35 minute lead on us.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.292
Good work.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.046
I'm really good at this,

42:29.964 --> 42:31.840
-like a prodigy.
-Okay, stop annoying me.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.385
I've been checking
her Instagram and her TikTok,

42:34.468 --> 42:35.302
there's been nothing.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.639
I emailed her and I texted her,
like, 60 times and there's still nothing.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.432
[cell phone bleeps]

42:41.475 --> 42:43.352
Hey! Bank account!

42:44.061 --> 42:46.897
Sterling just used her debit card,
like, a bunch of times at

42:46.981 --> 42:51.610
G-A-V-E-N-R-S-3-4-2-1.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.528
What does that mean?

42:52.611 --> 42:54.280
VEN: vending machine.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.115
RS: rest stop. Look up those numbers.

42:56.198 --> 42:57.533
Okay... Um...

42:59.326 --> 43:01.370
-It's right off Hawkins Ridge!
-Hold on.

43:01.453 --> 43:03.122
-[tires screech]
-[Blair screams]

43:05.124 --> 43:06.417
[horns honk]

43:18.887 --> 43:19.972
[gasps]

43:20.055 --> 43:21.181
Sour Patch Kids!

43:21.265 --> 43:23.475
Sterling hates them,
but she knows I love them,

43:23.559 --> 43:25.477
even when they cut my mouth up
like little razor blades.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.395
It's a sign.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.023
[door opens]

43:33.736 --> 43:34.612
Sterl--

43:36.196 --> 43:37.615
Hey, hey, message.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.244
"Dana, Mom's twin. Levi, white man,
croc tat, forties."

43:42.494 --> 43:44.330
"I-L-Y-S-M-S."

43:45.039 --> 43:47.583
License plate. I can run this
through the Georgia registry.

43:47.666 --> 43:50.169
Then we can do Florida and Alabama
if we come up short.

43:50.753 --> 43:54.340
No, "I love you so much, Sis."

43:55.257 --> 43:56.216
[sighs]

43:57.926 --> 44:00.137
-What--?
-Okay, kid. No, no, no, no, no...

44:00.304 --> 44:02.014
We're gonna get her, okay?

44:02.473 --> 44:04.683
Come on. Come on. Come on.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.185
-We're gonna get her.
-Okay.

44:06.268 --> 44:07.519
-All right? Let's go.
-Okay.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.399
We gotta dig up those names.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.151
Only cops can do that, right?

44:14.234 --> 44:15.694
Stop saying stuff I know.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.863
So, we need to talk to somebody
who knows cops, right?

44:17.946 --> 44:19.031
I said, stop saying stuff I know.

44:19.615 --> 44:20.616
Get in the car.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.080
Hey, my man, Bowser.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.248
Look, I got a lot of hits on that vid.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.208
No hard feelings, right?

44:29.291 --> 44:31.669
Yeah, my feelings are not hard.
Just give me the info, Terrance.

44:31.752 --> 44:35.381
Okay, my man, Arnold,
from the 16th Precinct hooked me up.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.425
What do we have here?
Nothing on a Dana Culpepper.

44:38.509 --> 44:39.927
Nada, zip.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.345
It's like she's a ghost or something,

44:41.428 --> 44:45.265
but I do have a record
on a white male, Levi, in his forties

44:45.349 --> 44:47.142
with a crocodile tattoo on his neck.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.312
Levi Yates, 44, brown hair.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.522
Ooh, he's been busy.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.358
What do we have here?
We got trespassing, B and E,

44:54.775 --> 44:55.859
aggravated assault,

44:55.943 --> 44:58.445
assault again, drug possession,

44:58.904 --> 45:00.781
two attempts to traffic over the border,

45:00.864 --> 45:02.157
and the list goes on.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.742
You got a last known address?

45:03.826 --> 45:07.162
Bluebird RV Park,
13 West Alpharetta Parkway,

45:07.246 --> 45:08.414
out in the middle of nowhere.

45:08.497 --> 45:09.665
That's out by 141.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.625
Makes sense
with the direction they're heading in.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.293
Dana's going to pick him up.

45:13.377 --> 45:14.336
Yep, all right.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.879
Hey, Terrance, um...

45:16.630 --> 45:17.464
thank you.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.674
Oh, you got it, my man.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.884
Anything you need, just let me know.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.220
Besides my girlfriend.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.596
Yeah, okay. Jesus.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.433
-[cell phone rings]
-Oh, God.

45:29.768 --> 45:32.146
-Hi, Mom.
-God, where the heck are you, sweetie?

45:32.813 --> 45:33.981
Are you out of your mind?

45:34.064 --> 45:36.150
-Your sister is missing and we--
-Yeah, no duh.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.694
-Hey!
-Sorry, I didn't mean to sass you,

45:38.777 --> 45:42.322
but Mom, the guy who Sterling
and I work for, Mr.Â Bowser,

45:42.406 --> 45:45.159
he's been helping me track Sterling
through the truck's Peach Pass

45:45.242 --> 45:46.410
and Sterling's bank account,

45:46.493 --> 45:48.495
and we think we know where they're headed.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.707
-Oh, Blair--
-Mom, you have to trust me on this.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.500
I'll text you the address, okay?

45:53.584 --> 45:54.543
No, just wait--

45:54.626 --> 45:55.627
[disconnect tone]

45:55.711 --> 45:56.628
[groans]

45:57.421 --> 45:59.214
-[sighs]
-[cell phone bleeps]

45:59.298 --> 46:01.300
[male police officer]
You said she's dangerous.

46:01.383 --> 46:02.468
What do you mean by that?

46:03.552 --> 46:04.386
Ma'am?

46:04.636 --> 46:06.638
We have a few questions
about the person of interest.

46:06.722 --> 46:10.476
Sure, you know, if I could just have
one moment with my husband.

46:10.559 --> 46:12.311
-[chuckles and clears throat]
-Excuse me.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.899
Oh, God. Oh.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.650
I know where Dana may be taking Sterling.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.402
-We have to go.
-Okay.

46:21.069 --> 46:21.904
Oh.

46:23.113 --> 46:25.616
-All right, go. Let's just go. Quietly.
-[person clears throat]

46:32.372 --> 46:34.249
[Anderson] Yee-haw!

46:34.333 --> 46:36.251
-[chuckling] Heck, yeah!
-[Debbie] Oh! Anderson!

46:36.752 --> 46:37.586
[tires screech]

46:44.843 --> 46:46.512
[buzzer sounds]

46:52.726 --> 46:54.102
This is where you're from.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.396
Your roots.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.566
Your mama's been
trying to hide it from you,

46:59.650 --> 47:02.110
but Aunt Dana's here to show you
where you really come from.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.906
This could have been you in another life.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.169
Hey, baby.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.171
What the hell is this?

47:21.255 --> 47:22.381
Sterling, meet Levi.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.007
You got Sterling.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.425
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.469
Dana, this was not part of the plan.

47:27.970 --> 47:31.598
Oh, well, if it's too much trouble,
then I'm happy to be on my way.

47:31.682 --> 47:32.724
You know what, I'll just hoof it.

47:32.808 --> 47:35.269
Don't worry about driving me.
Aunt Dana. I will see you at Christmas.

47:35.352 --> 47:36.770
No.

47:37.145 --> 47:38.230
No.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.775
I'm good at adapting to new situations.

47:42.901 --> 47:45.362
Since you went and made this decision
all by your little self...

47:45.445 --> 47:46.321
Oh, come on.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.614
I got a better idea.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.700
We're gonna ask for more money.

47:49.783 --> 47:50.659
Money from who?

47:51.535 --> 47:52.911
From the Richie Rich Wesleys.

47:53.579 --> 47:54.621
You made a dumb bitch move,

47:54.705 --> 47:57.374
but you stumbled
into a golden goose opportunity.

48:02.212 --> 48:03.714
Shit, the gate's locked.

48:09.386 --> 48:10.304
All right.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.639
[screams]

48:14.850 --> 48:15.851
[both laugh]

48:15.934 --> 48:18.312
-[Levi] What the hell was that?
-Help! I'm in here!

48:18.395 --> 48:19.479
Shut it, blondie.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.899
Do not call her that.
It's our thing, baby.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.862
Come on, let's just put that gun down
and talk about it, all right?

48:26.945 --> 48:29.448
And how do you suggest
I handle this situation, huh?

48:29.531 --> 48:30.365
Back off.

48:30.449 --> 48:33.035
I will not stand for you
putting Sterling at risk.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.620
You're all confident today.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.497
You takin' the pill again
without tellin' me?

48:37.748 --> 48:38.999
You know that's murder.

48:39.082 --> 48:39.917
No.

48:42.210 --> 48:45.047
I'm just mad 'cause you're acting
all irresponsible.

48:46.423 --> 48:47.799
Enough, all right?

48:47.883 --> 48:49.301
I'm sorry, baby.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.219
Let's say a quick prayer,

48:51.929 --> 48:55.140
and then we'll lock her in the bathroom
till the shit dies down outside.

48:55.223 --> 48:56.141
-Yeah.
-All right.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.436
Let's go. Come on up, little girl.

49:02.940 --> 49:03.857
Bow your heads.

49:07.861 --> 49:10.322
Dear Lord, please help Dana and Sterling

49:10.405 --> 49:11.823
not screw this whole thing up.

49:12.741 --> 49:15.619
In Christ's name, Amen.

49:15.786 --> 49:16.620
Amen.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.038
All right, in the bathroom.

49:18.121 --> 49:20.248
Now. Get her in the bathroom.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.132
You don't have to do this, you know.

49:29.466 --> 49:30.884
That guy seems kinda mean!

49:30.968 --> 49:33.053
No, he's not mean, he's passionate.

49:34.179 --> 49:36.515
Besides, I owe him some grace,
he's given me so much.

49:36.765 --> 49:37.641
What do you mean?

49:39.935 --> 49:43.522
When I was lost, down, real empty handed,

49:43.605 --> 49:44.731
he gave me a place to sleep,

49:44.815 --> 49:46.942
you know, and food to eat.

49:47.609 --> 49:50.278
A reason to keep going, keep on hidin'.

49:50.362 --> 49:53.573
Wow, you really put all your eggs
into one poorly woven basket.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.952
[sighs] You're so sweet.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.162
Why don't we just leave?

49:59.830 --> 50:02.124
The two of us,
just sneak out and don't look back.

50:02.207 --> 50:03.041
[scoffs]

50:10.090 --> 50:10.966
I can't.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.051
I can't leave him, I don't have a choice.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.219
No, you do have a choice.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.347
We always have a choice.
Be a good Christian,

50:17.764 --> 50:21.059
the real kind, with love in your heart.

50:22.394 --> 50:23.311
Do it for me.

50:24.312 --> 50:26.648
[voice wavering]
Look, I'm just a kid, do the right thing.

50:31.903 --> 50:33.321
It's easier said than done.

Oh, my Gosh, you came! You really came!

51:31.880 --> 51:33.381
Of course, I came. Are you okay?

51:33.465 --> 51:36.593
Did she hurt you?
Also, oh, my fucking jeez, Mom is a twin!

51:36.676 --> 51:38.553
It's insane. I'm really scared.

51:38.637 --> 51:40.764
They're armed and they're standing
on the inside of the door.

51:40.847 --> 51:42.099
The walls are like aluminum foil,

51:42.182 --> 51:43.642
so you got to be really careful
of gunshots.

51:43.725 --> 51:44.643
I'm gonna get you out of there.

51:44.726 --> 51:46.061
I love you so much!

51:46.144 --> 51:47.020
I love you so much.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.523
Also, I'm sorry I said
that your hair looks stupid.

51:49.606 --> 51:50.982
It actually looks really pretty like that.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.818
I feel like you don't do
half up-half down enough.

51:52.901 --> 51:55.946
Thank you! And I'm sorry I said
your face looks bad.

51:56.029 --> 51:57.364
Your face is so beautiful!

51:57.948 --> 51:58.949
Yeah, it really is.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.158
Okay, now, please save me!

52:00.242 --> 52:01.118
Oh, yeah!

52:02.077 --> 52:04.830
Dana and Levi are by the door
and they're armed.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.414
-How you know that?
-I just do.

52:06.498 --> 52:07.582
It's a twin thing.
