WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
[hard rock music playing]

00:21.771 --> 00:23.106
Okay, you were right.

00:23.898 --> 00:24.983
We're not talking.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.027
I'm still extremely mad at you.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.030
Fine. Then I'm still mad at you, too.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.072
Great.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.200
-Your hair looks stupid by the way.
-[gasps]

00:34.284 --> 00:35.118
Your...

00:35.827 --> 00:36.661
face looks bad.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.997
-No, it doesn't. My face rules.
-Whatever!

00:39.080 --> 00:41.332
[both growl]

00:42.709 --> 00:43.710
[tires screech]

00:48.006 --> 00:49.716
-[Debbie gasps]
-Thank the Lord!

00:49.799 --> 00:52.761
Glad you're alive, but oh, boy,
are you dead meat.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.471
Your father and I have been sick,
worried about y'all,

00:54.554 --> 00:56.848
and you did not even have
the decency to answer your cell phones!

00:56.931 --> 00:58.266
-Cell phones are a privilege!
-That is right!

00:58.349 --> 01:00.143
Mom, Dad, cut the crap.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.895
-Blair, do not sass me!
-Yeah, cut the crap!

01:01.978 --> 01:02.896
[Anderson gasps]

01:02.979 --> 01:04.397
-Sterling!
-Sterling.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.690
What has gotten into you, young lady?

01:05.774 --> 01:08.026
We know about you!
The real whole dang serious truth!

01:08.109 --> 01:10.570
Yes, and where to begin, Mom?

01:10.653 --> 01:11.529
Well, let's see.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.198
You're not from Savannah,

01:13.281 --> 01:15.200
you're from Nandina, Georgia.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.953
Where you belong to
Tabernacle Church of Christ the Reindeer--

01:19.037 --> 01:20.622
-Redeemer, Redeemer...
-Redeemer!

01:20.830 --> 01:24.167
Where you might be sad to learn that
one of your childhood snakes just died.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.254
And, oh, yeah, you're wanted
for first-degree arson!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.381
That's enough, Blair! That's enough.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.176
Mom, you have to tell us the truth.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.599
All right, yes.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.522
Yes, I have not been entirely truthful
about my past.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.439
[scoffs]

01:46.523 --> 01:49.984
But it was because she--
we needed to protect you.

01:50.068 --> 01:50.902
From what?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.405
All right, girls. Just listen. It...

01:55.198 --> 01:57.075
It was a different time in my life.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.537
I was very young and impressionable

02:00.620 --> 02:02.997
and I fell in with an extreme crowd,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.167
and I acted out of hate, not love.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.877
And that is not what God intended.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.088
I can see that now.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.214
So, you did this.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.007
You set fire to an abortion clinic!

02:14.050 --> 02:15.677
That is not very Christian of you!

02:15.760 --> 02:16.594
No.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.097
But at the time,
I thought it was very Christian.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.014
[scoffs]

02:20.098 --> 02:22.016
Obviously, I was wrong.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.727
-Was anyone hurt?
-No. No.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.479
Thank the Lord. No one was hurt.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.148
This is not an excuse

02:28.606 --> 02:31.484
because we should always
take responsibility for our actions,

02:31.943 --> 02:33.736
but I was acting under the influence

02:33.820 --> 02:37.991
of some very persuasive people.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.453
They were saying, uh,
provocative things about the Lord,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.122
things that are not true

02:44.581 --> 02:45.957
knowing God the way I do now,

02:46.457 --> 02:49.002
how he forgives and loves all people.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.797
I'm ashamed I fell so far off the path.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.053
Who are these people?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.598
Were you in a cult?

03:01.973 --> 03:02.974
Why did you do it?

03:03.057 --> 03:04.142
Are people after you?

03:04.225 --> 03:05.685
Did the police question you?

03:05.768 --> 03:07.770
-Did you feel cool in the moment?
-Blair!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.189
Girls, the details are not important.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.774
What you need to know is
that from the moment we had you,

03:11.858 --> 03:13.151
we have done everything in our power

03:13.234 --> 03:16.321
to make sure that you do not wind up
like I did those many years ago.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.157
All right, we have--

03:20.742 --> 03:22.243
We have worked so hard...

03:23.578 --> 03:24.621
to give you this life.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.748
We both have.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.797
-Are you in danger?
-Are we safe?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.717
I'm not in danger and we are safe.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.970
We have a plan, and lawyers.

03:41.054 --> 03:41.888
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.390
-And everything is gonna be just fine.
-Yeah.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.938
[exhales deeply] Okay.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.189
[chuckles] Wow.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.733
Our, uh-- Our big family secret is out.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.276
-It is a lot...
-A lot.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.819
...but it's out, there it is.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.905
So, here's what we're gonna do.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.326
[sniffs]
I am gonna pack y'all some snacks to-go

04:03.409 --> 04:04.994
while you put on your PJs,

04:05.078 --> 04:07.288
and y'all are gonna go
to that lock-in tonight

04:07.372 --> 04:10.333
and enjoy being teenagers
while you still can.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.836
All right. Come on, girls, let's go.
Chop chop!

04:13.920 --> 04:14.921
Hummus and veggies?

04:15.004 --> 04:16.589
-And Oreos.
-Yeah.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.549
Oh. All right. Go, go, go.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.468
[chuckles]

04:21.302 --> 04:23.972
[theme music]

04:24.055 --> 04:26.349
[vocalizing]

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
I need cash to deposit,
our bank account is low.

05:07.140 --> 05:07.974
Why?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.727
Gas, lock-in pizza.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.644
Fine.

05:13.813 --> 05:14.647
How much?

05:15.023 --> 05:15.857
Two hundred.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.283
So...

05:27.285 --> 05:28.119
So.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.331
Mom's a wanted fugitive.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.125
Mom is a wanted fugitive, happy Friday.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.713
It's like she was living
this whole double life

05:38.796 --> 05:39.756
that we didn't know about.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.342
We can't exactly judge her.
We're living a double life, too.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.178
Putting bad guys away.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.555
She was being a bad guy.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.018
Is that lip gloss?

05:53.394 --> 05:54.228
Oh.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.481
You're really pulling out
all the stops for April.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.150
Shove it. I want to look nice tonight,
in general.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.319
You're not gonna bail, right?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.697
I kind of need you there
with the whole me and April situation,

06:04.781 --> 06:06.657
for, like, moral support.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.744
Bailing is your thing, not mine.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.206
[cell phones bleep]

06:23.716 --> 06:25.176
Is he even here?

06:26.135 --> 06:28.763
-Girls.
-Bowser, what's happening?

06:28.846 --> 06:30.515
No offense, but we're slammed.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.350
I have 30 pizzas that are about to go live

06:32.433 --> 06:33.684
and I gotta be there when they land.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.771
Why do y'all work for me?

06:37.730 --> 06:38.731
Uh...

06:38.815 --> 06:41.025
You said you needed money
to fix your daddy's truck.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.903
You got that taken care of weeks ago.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.447
Yeah.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.455
-[Bowser] Hm?
-Wait! No, Bowser, that's not--

06:54.539 --> 06:55.873
It's, like, not what you think.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.583
How could you have known this whole time,

06:57.667 --> 07:00.670
and not told me that
your mama was some nutjob fugitive?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.256
Is that why you got in this business
in the first place, hm?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.174
To learn how to help somebody
evade the law?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.135
No, we didn't know, we promise.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.011
We just found out, like, today.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.555
Yeah, and our mom is not a nutjob.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.598
She only made a mistake,
like, a long time ago.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.184
How am I supposed to believe you?
You're a couple of liars.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.352
That is a nasty allegation.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.520
Never to you, Bowser.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.314
Really?

07:21.315 --> 07:22.358
[exhales deeply]

07:22.442 --> 07:24.068
Your folks came to see me yesterday,

07:24.152 --> 07:25.278
looking for you two.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.822
Lyin' is bad.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.408
But lying to your family...

07:32.243 --> 07:33.202
that's unforgivable.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.662
No, but we only skipped school

07:34.745 --> 07:36.497
so that we could figure out
what's going on with our mom.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.749
We swear we didn't know about her before.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.668
I ain't got time for all your excuses.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.546
This shit done got too complicated
with the two of you.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.716
Now I'm playing boss
and babysitter and bestie, apparently.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.386
You didn't have to answer my call today.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.971
I know I didn't have to.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.724
I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming myself.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.145
Running with y'all got me soft.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.481
So soft, I threw a skip.

08:02.106 --> 08:06.235
It reminded me why
I only look out for myself, and that's it!

08:06.319 --> 08:09.780
Well, I think
that's a really shitty approach to life.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.991
[Bowser] Yeah, well,
why don't you finish high school

08:12.074 --> 08:13.910
before you talk to me about life?

08:14.827 --> 08:15.661
Hm?

08:17.914 --> 08:18.748
You're fired.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.876
-We're fired?
-Mm-hm.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.004
Just because we're, like,
friends with you?

08:25.087 --> 08:26.464
No! You're fired because

08:26.547 --> 08:29.091
I should have never got involved with you
in the first place!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.844
A couple of kids in pajamas, even.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.847
I was doing just fine.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.935
And you came in
and you convinced me to change things.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.186
You mean be happy?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.103
Happy?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.356
Do I look happy to you, right now?

08:44.148 --> 08:44.982
No.

08:45.066 --> 08:45.900
No.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.278
And the mochi on the motherfucking
non-fat yogurt sundae...

08:50.696 --> 08:54.700
Now, I know the whereabouts
of a wanted fugitive.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.077
You're not gonna turn our mom in, are you?

08:57.787 --> 08:58.663
No.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.831
I'm not going to turn her in.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.084
Because of you!

09:04.085 --> 09:06.504
Because you put me
in an impossible situation here.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.258
So, now I'm forced to forgo my ethics

09:10.716 --> 09:12.677
and leave 90,000 dollars on the table.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.595
So, yeah, sorry, girls.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
I'm gonna need you to get up out of here.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.809
Now!

09:31.070 --> 09:32.238
[Blair sighs]

09:33.614 --> 09:34.448
Are you okay?

09:36.117 --> 09:36.951
Yeah.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.078
Just, you know...

09:40.955 --> 09:41.956
rejected.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.332
Again.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.759
I've been thinking about
what you said in Nandina.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.680
About me creating drama, or whatever.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.391
I'm sorry I said all that stuff, Blair,
but you said mean stuff, too.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.352
That you have blonde hair
and that you're gonna go to UGA?

10:03.686 --> 10:04.520
Yeah.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.897
Whoo. How will you ever forgive me?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.107
You said I was boring.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.193
You were harsh and you know it.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.528
Well, I was pissed, okay?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.118
But what sucks and makes me want to...

10:19.702 --> 10:21.329
punch you in the face, lightly...

10:23.164 --> 10:24.582
is that, uh...

10:28.753 --> 10:30.129
I think you're kinda right.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.343
I'd rather...

10:37.011 --> 10:39.180
stir things up, so...

10:40.514 --> 10:43.100
life feels bad because of my actions,

10:45.227 --> 10:46.187
rather than...

10:49.815 --> 10:52.943
just life... feeling bad.

10:55.029 --> 10:59.533
And I want to want
to go with you to the lock-in, but...

11:01.160 --> 11:02.411
I just don't.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.874
I want to be with Miles.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.754
I think I love him.

11:13.089 --> 11:13.964
Oh.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.259
Blair, it's gonna be really hard,

11:18.052 --> 11:20.304
and it's gonna take some time,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.099
but you're gonna get over it.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.183
Like I did with Luke.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.895
I don't love him the way you loved Luke.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.567
I love him the way Luke loves you.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.279
Oh. Um...

11:39.073 --> 11:39.949
Wow.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.742
That's the real deal.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.704
Yeah.

11:47.665 --> 11:52.378
Is it for you with... April?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.255
I don't know.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.424
It could be.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.385
[chuckles]
Soon you'll be scissoring our enemy.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.721
Girls don't actually scissor each other.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.097
What do they do?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.224
I don't know, but I guess I'll find out.

12:07.351 --> 12:11.230
You know I don't care
if you're, like, gay, or whatever.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.023
I'm more undefined than that.

12:13.816 --> 12:14.650
Like...

12:15.860 --> 12:17.987
if sexuality was a color wheel,

12:18.237 --> 12:23.284
I'd be in the blue-pink-purple part.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.994
I said, "Or whatever."

12:25.077 --> 12:27.037
You could bang a ficus, for all I care,

12:37.214 --> 12:38.924

12:39.341 --> 12:40.676

12:41.135 --> 12:42.511
No...  [sighs] ...Sterling.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.807
[sighs] He dumped me.
I'm not gonna go to him.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.100
You love him, right?

12:48.559 --> 12:51.896
Like, the full, real,
sick to your stomach kind of love?

12:51.979 --> 12:55.441
Yeah. Like--
Like I want to throw up all the time.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.234
Then you've gotta tell him how you feel.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.278
Okay? Life is too short to love in secret.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.489
"The truth will set you free."

13:02.031 --> 13:03.449
Oh, no, no.

Love has made you too cheesy.

you are here, Sterling.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.917

13:55.000 --> 13:56.710
and now Hannah B and Ezequiel

13:56.794 --> 13:59.004

of a power struggle.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.339
What for?

14:00.422 --> 14:02.925
Over whether we're watching
Prince of Egypt

14:03.008 --> 14:05.052
or Davey and Goliath's
Snowboard Christmas.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.137
I prefer Prince of Egypt myself,

14:07.221 --> 14:09.098
so I can save Davey and Goliath
for the holidays with my nana,

14:09.181 --> 14:11.475
but I have been getting emails
from parents

14:11.559 --> 14:13.310
who are concerned that this lock-in

14:13.394 --> 14:15.688
is gonna promote sexual activity.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.524
And that animated Moses,

14:18.607 --> 14:22.194
I mean, he certainly promotes
something deep within, right?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.613
With the dark hair and the bronze calves,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.574

14:26.657 --> 14:27.741
It's your call.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.869
Um...

14:29.952 --> 14:31.787
-Prince of Egypt.
-Okay.

14:32.037 --> 14:35.624
Yes. Because I had a hard time
really believing

14:35.708 --> 14:39.336
that you kids would ever
be thinking about sexual activity

14:39.420 --> 14:41.839
at an innocent event
like an overnight lock-in.

This is just good, clean fun.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.229
Um, I'm gonna double check
and see if the scavenger hunt clues

14:57.313 --> 14:58.689
-are all in the right places.
-Okay.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.065
[Sterling] I'll be back in a few.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.614
Oh, wow.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.365

when people have finished their pizza.

And what will they do while they eat?

Listen to all the chewing,

16:41.583 --> 16:43.460
Maybe they'll have
meaningful conversations

16:43.544 --> 16:45.170
with their friends, Ezequiel.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.630
I wouldn't know what that's like.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.549
Hey, guys. Have you seen April?

16:48.632 --> 16:50.384
Uh, she snagged the good sleeping corner.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.885
Typically, seniors get that.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.178
She must have pulled some strings.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.850
-So, the movie's gonna start at 11:00.
-[groans]

I saw you guys on the Twister mat earlier.

Hey, April. I thought
you were gonna save me a spot.

Really? I don't remember that.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.159

17:15.784 --> 17:18.746
Uh... No, remember you were--
you were gonna save me a spot

17:18.829 --> 17:20.748
because we were gonna hang out tonight?

It was really expensive,

is new to me.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.367
And I have realized
that I don't totally deserve you...

35:26.916 --> 35:28.584
and everything will be just fine.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.337
My suspicions were correct.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.713
You were lying!

35:32.797 --> 35:35.383
You know, this is very traumatic,

35:35.466 --> 35:37.760
making me not trust my own instincts.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.139
-I am going to be in therapy for years!
-Okay, Blair.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.015
I'm gonna have to take a gap year,
at least!

35:45.768 --> 35:48.396
Okay, I know that it's very important
to find Sterling right now,

35:48.771 --> 35:50.314
but please don't forget,

35:50.690 --> 35:53.234
-I'm really super mad at you.
-Okay.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.944
No, we won't, we won't, we won't. Um...

35:55.486 --> 35:57.905
Debbie, just keep trying Dana
and I'm gonna try Sterling, okay.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.032
I am. Goshdang it,
she's still not picking up.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.409
I think we need to call the police.

36:02.702 --> 36:03.578
-But--
-No.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.371
There's no "buts." I'm calling the police.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.289
Wait, Anderson--

36:06.372 --> 36:07.498
Sterling is our daughter

36:07.582 --> 36:09.458
and I am calling the goddamn police!

36:12.795 --> 36:13.629
Okay.

36:26.142 --> 36:26.976
Hey.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.312
What are you doing here so late?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.272
You don't need it anymore?

36:32.481 --> 36:33.524
Do you want to come in?

36:33.608 --> 36:35.109
No, no. Here.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.946
Going out of town for a little bit.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.281
Maybe a while.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.116
Going where?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.117
Down to Florida.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.078
I reconnected with Tim, and Jordy,

36:46.162 --> 36:47.580
and D. Brad, and those guys.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.458
They got a couple of skips
I brought in before,

36:50.541 --> 36:51.500
they could use my help.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.546
-You know you left Florida for a reason.
-Yeah.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.716
What about Yogurtopia?

36:58.799 --> 37:00.384
I'm letting Miss Cathy take over.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.595
Yeah, she damn near fainted
when I told her,

37:02.678 --> 37:04.138
or she was just really tired.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.434
Are you coming back... to Atlanta?

37:09.602 --> 37:11.729
Just feel like
there isn't much here for me now.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.731
[scoffs] Guess I'm just chopped liver?

37:15.816 --> 37:16.943
You're with someone else.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.448
So, what? You're leaving?

37:22.907 --> 37:24.200
Because you got your feelings hurt?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.744
I thought we were friends.

37:26.827 --> 37:27.870
Ah, look, here...

37:28.621 --> 37:32.124
I'm leaving because
it's feeling like a dead end.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.877
What about your team?

37:34.961 --> 37:36.420
My teenage white saviors?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.339
Yeah, they're kind of your family now.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.383
They are not my family, okay?

37:40.466 --> 37:42.510
They're little girls
with attitude problems.

37:43.803 --> 37:44.929
Actually, that's just Blair,

37:45.012 --> 37:48.766
but they're annoying
and they ask too many questions,

37:48.849 --> 37:51.060
and they talk with their mouths full.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.645
If I have to listen to one more--

37:52.728 --> 37:54.313
[cell phone rings]

37:57.149 --> 37:57.984
Hello.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.319
[cell phone buzzes]

38:01.237 --> 38:02.363
[sighs] Shit.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.449
Hey. Got held up, but I'm on my way.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.867
-[Levi] You almost here?
-Yes.

38:06.951 --> 38:07.868
We gotta go!

38:07.952 --> 38:09.662
Yes, yes, yes, just be patient, baby.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.085
Hey, can we pull up at this rest stop?
I gotta pee real bad.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.753
No, don't have time. Hold it.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.130
Okay, I would hold it,

38:19.213 --> 38:22.133
but there's this guy, Declan Wright,
in Blair's study hall

38:22.216 --> 38:24.719
who held his pee
and his testicle exploded,

38:24.802 --> 38:27.430
which is weird because
urine is in the bladder,

38:27.513 --> 38:28.723
but that's what the doctor said.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.599
If you hold your pee
for a really long time

38:30.683 --> 38:31.934
your bladder actually expands,

38:32.018 --> 38:33.811
which at first sounds like
it would be a good thing

38:33.894 --> 38:35.896
because it's like, you know,
a greater surface area,

38:35.980 --> 38:38.316
greater ability to house a larger volume,

38:38.399 --> 38:41.068
but in actuality, it's, um-- uh...

38:41.652 --> 38:42.695
[Dana clears throat]

38:45.656 --> 38:47.074
Jeez, you're just like my mom.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.244
Okay, we're pulling over.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.925
Hey. Stay close, Muffin.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.975
Whoa. What the hell are you doing?
I thought you had to piss.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.143
[machine beeps]

39:14.226 --> 39:15.895
Oh, I do, but I'm also starving.

39:15.978 --> 39:18.397
It's been two hours since I ate
and I'm growing like a weed. [chuckles]

39:18.481 --> 39:20.191
I gotta have a snack,
something Sour Patch.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.568
That shit's disgusting.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.744
You know kids and their candy. [giggles]

39:33.871 --> 39:35.998
[sighs]
My mom would never let me get this much.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.876
Thank you, so much, Mom's sister.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.544
Aunt Dana. [chuckles]

39:40.628 --> 39:41.712
You're the best!

39:42.755 --> 39:44.173
-Thank you.
-Oh, yeah, well.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.175
Sure.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.374
[breathing deeply]

40:28.551 --> 40:31.262
Dear Lord, what up? It's me, again.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.390
I'm really scared right now,

40:34.473 --> 40:35.891
but I know you have a plan.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.143
[breathing deeply]

40:37.226 --> 40:40.479
Please help keep me
and the people I love safe.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.107
Please help me be brave.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.151
Please help me kick butt.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.029
And then, something for later,

40:49.447 --> 40:51.407
when I'm not being kidnapped anymore.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.202
Please help Dana figure out

40:55.703 --> 40:58.831
how to have a peaceful, more happy life.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.375
It seems like she's got a lot of, like...

41:02.376 --> 41:03.419
problems.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.005
Okay.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.089
I think that's it.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.341
[exhales deeply] Amen.

41:10.092 --> 41:10.926
[sniffs]

41:11.302 --> 41:12.136
-Hey!
-[pounding]

41:13.012 --> 41:13.929
Come on.

41:14.263 --> 41:15.264
You done pissin'?

41:15.556 --> 41:17.475
Don't forget to wipe-- front to back.
All right?

41:18.058 --> 41:18.893
Come on.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.480
Oh, right. Uh, good idea. Wiping now.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.693
And she's been missing
for less than an hour?

41:28.152 --> 41:30.779
-[Debbie] Yes.
-Someone picked her up at the school

41:30.863 --> 41:33.032
in a gray pickup truck,

41:33.115 --> 41:37.036
uh, license plate GT9684J.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.829
-And how do you know that?
-It's our car.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.125
Do you have any ideas
about the person in question?

41:43.209 --> 41:45.252
Well, yes.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.670
It's her aunt.

41:48.714 --> 41:52.635
So, her aunt picked her up at school
in the family vehicle?

41:54.094 --> 41:55.554
I'm sorry, is there any reason to believe

41:55.638 --> 41:57.765
that this family member
is a danger to your daughter?

41:57.848 --> 41:58.682
Yes.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.143
[officer] Okay, what is it?

42:01.227 --> 42:03.437
Oh, um... You-- n-- n--

42:03.979 --> 42:06.273
-N-- Nothing specific comes to mind.
-[cell phone bleeps]

42:06.357 --> 42:09.652
[Anderson] Ju-- Just generally
kind of a bad influence.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.279
[Blair]
The text message came in at 10:32 p.m..

42:12.363 --> 42:14.490
The school is 1.2 miles northeast of here

42:14.573 --> 42:16.784
and based on the truck's
Peach Pass time stamps,

42:16.867 --> 42:19.662
they're heading southwest
of Atlanta on I-85.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.206
My guess is that they have
a 35 minute lead on us.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.292
Good work.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.046
I'm really good at this,

42:29.964 --> 42:31.840
-like a prodigy.
-Okay, stop annoying me.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.385
I've been checking
her Instagram and her TikTok,

42:34.468 --> 42:35.302
there's been nothing.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.639
I emailed her and I texted her,
like, 60 times and there's still nothing.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.432
[cell phone bleeps]

42:41.475 --> 42:43.352
Hey! Bank account!

42:44.061 --> 42:46.897
Sterling just used her debit card,
like, a bunch of times at

42:46.981 --> 42:51.610
G-A-V-E-N-R-S-3-4-2-1.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.528
What does that mean?

42:52.611 --> 42:54.280
VEN: vending machine.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.115
RS: rest stop. Look up those numbers.

42:56.198 --> 42:57.533
Okay... Um...

42:59.326 --> 43:01.370
-It's right off Hawkins Ridge!
-Hold on.

43:01.453 --> 43:03.122
-[tires screech]
-[Blair screams]

43:05.124 --> 43:06.417
[horns honk]

43:18.887 --> 43:19.972
[gasps]

43:20.055 --> 43:21.181
Sour Patch Kids!

43:21.265 --> 43:23.475
Sterling hates them,
but she knows I love them,

43:23.559 --> 43:25.477
even when they cut my mouth up
like little razor blades.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.395
It's a sign.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.023
[door opens]

43:33.736 --> 43:34.612
Sterl--

43:36.196 --> 43:37.615
Hey, hey, message.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.244
"Dana, Mom's twin. Levi, white man,
croc tat, forties."

43:42.494 --> 43:44.330
"I-L-Y-S-M-S."

43:45.039 --> 43:47.583
License plate. I can run this
through the Georgia registry.

43:47.666 --> 43:50.169
Then we can do Florida and Alabama
if we come up short.

43:50.753 --> 43:54.340
No, "I love you so much, Sis."

43:55.257 --> 43:56.216
[sighs]

43:57.926 --> 44:00.137
-What--?
-Okay, kid. No, no, no, no, no...

44:00.304 --> 44:02.014
We're gonna get her, okay?

44:02.473 --> 44:04.683
Come on. Come on. Come on.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.185
-We're gonna get her.
-Okay.

44:06.268 --> 44:07.519
-All right? Let's go.
-Okay.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.399
We gotta dig up those names.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.151
Only cops can do that, right?

44:14.234 --> 44:15.694
Stop saying stuff I know.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.863
So, we need to talk to somebody
who knows cops, right?

44:17.946 --> 44:19.031
I said, stop saying stuff I know.

44:19.615 --> 44:20.616
Get in the car.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.080
Hey, my man, Bowser.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.248
Look, I got a lot of hits on that vid.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.208
No hard feelings, right?

44:29.291 --> 44:31.669
Yeah, my feelings are not hard.
Just give me the info, Terrance.

44:31.752 --> 44:35.381
Okay, my man, Arnold,
from the 16th Precinct hooked me up.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.425
What do we have here?
Nothing on a Dana Culpepper.

44:38.509 --> 44:39.927
Nada, zip.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.345
It's like she's a ghost or something,

44:41.428 --> 44:45.265
but I do have a record
on a white male, Levi, in his forties

44:45.349 --> 44:47.142
with a crocodile tattoo on his neck.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.312
Levi Yates, 44, brown hair.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.522
Ooh, he's been busy.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.358
What do we have here?
We got trespassing, B and E,

44:54.775 --> 44:55.859
aggravated assault,

44:55.943 --> 44:58.445
assault again, drug possession,

44:58.904 --> 45:00.781
two attempts to traffic over the border,

45:00.864 --> 45:02.157
and the list goes on.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.742
You got a last known address?

45:03.826 --> 45:07.162
Bluebird RV Park,
13 West Alpharetta Parkway,

45:07.246 --> 45:08.414
out in the middle of nowhere.

45:08.497 --> 45:09.665
That's out by 141.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.625
Makes sense
with the direction they're heading in.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.293
Dana's going to pick him up.

45:13.377 --> 45:14.336
Yep, all right.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.879
Hey, Terrance, um...

45:16.630 --> 45:17.464
thank you.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.674
Oh, you got it, my man.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.884
Anything you need, just let me know.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.220
Besides my girlfriend.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.596
Yeah, okay. Jesus.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.433
-[cell phone rings]
-Oh, God.

45:29.768 --> 45:32.146
-Hi, Mom.
-God, where the heck are you, sweetie?

45:32.813 --> 45:33.981
Are you out of your mind?

45:34.064 --> 45:36.150
-Your sister is missing and we--
-Yeah, no duh.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.694
-Hey!
-Sorry, I didn't mean to sass you,

45:38.777 --> 45:42.322
but Mom, the guy who Sterling
and I work for, Mr. Bowser,

45:42.406 --> 45:45.159
he's been helping me track Sterling
through the truck's Peach Pass

45:45.242 --> 45:46.410
and Sterling's bank account,

45:46.493 --> 45:48.495
and we think we know where they're headed.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.707
-Oh, Blair--
-Mom, you have to trust me on this.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.500
I'll text you the address, okay?

45:53.584 --> 45:54.543
No, just wait--

45:54.626 --> 45:55.627
[disconnect tone]

45:55.711 --> 45:56.628
[groans]

45:57.421 --> 45:59.214
-[sighs]
-[cell phone bleeps]

45:59.298 --> 46:01.300
[male police officer]
You said she's dangerous.

46:01.383 --> 46:02.468
What do you mean by that?

46:03.552 --> 46:04.386
Ma'am?

46:04.636 --> 46:06.638
We have a few questions
about the person of interest.

46:06.722 --> 46:10.476
Sure, you know, if I could just have
one moment with my husband.

46:10.559 --> 46:12.311
-[chuckles and clears throat]
-Excuse me.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.899

48:51.929 --> 48:55.140
and then we'll lock her in the bathroom
till the shit dies down outside.

he's given me so much.
