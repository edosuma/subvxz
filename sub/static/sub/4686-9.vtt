00:00.335 --> 00:01.843
<i>So here's</i>
<i>what you missed on</i> Glee:

00:01.869 --> 00:03.836
<i>Rachel's got the lead</i>
<i>in</i> Funny Girl <i>on Broadway,</i>

00:03.871 --> 00:05.771
<i>and Santana doesn't know</i>
<i>what she wants to do.</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:07.506
Bad Yeast goes scat
with Yeast-i-stat.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.275
<i>The New Directions! are getting</i>
<i>ready for college...</i>

00:09.309 --> 00:10.877
<i>Artie's going</i>
<i>to film school in Brooklyn</i>

00:10.911 --> 00:12.478
<i>and Blaine auditioned for NYADA.</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:14.113
<i>Kurt formed a band,</i>
<i>but he's afraid Starchild's</i>

00:14.147 --> 00:15.348
<i>trying to steal the spotlight.</i>

00:15.382 --> 00:16.849
<i>Which is easy</i>
<i>when you dress like</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:17.984
<i>a glam rock Ebenezer Scrooge.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:19.285
Thank you for your time,
Starchild,

00:19.319 --> 00:20.686
but it's not a good fit.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.655
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee.

00:24.299 --> 00:28.236
<i>¿Perdón? Perdón?</i>

00:28.270 --> 00:29.971
<i>Señorita.</i>

00:30.005 --> 00:33.074
<i>Esos huevos no esta caliente.</i>

00:33.108 --> 00:34.175
Excuse me?

00:34.209 --> 00:35.943
Oh, you speak English.

00:35.978 --> 00:37.211
I thought you were Mexican.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.779
- I'm from Ohio.
- Well, I didn't know

00:38.814 --> 00:40.681
there were Mexicans in Ohio.

00:40.716 --> 00:43.518
Okay. These eggs are cold.
I need new ones.

00:43.552 --> 00:45.553
(sizzling)

00:45.587 --> 00:47.688
There's steam
coming off of them.

00:47.723 --> 00:49.924
I happen to know that
eggs carry salmonella

00:49.958 --> 00:52.360
and I like them
cooked extra hot

00:52.394 --> 00:54.529
to kill any parasites.

00:54.563 --> 00:55.863
<i>Rápido, por favor.</i>

01:01.220 --> 01:02.980
Okay, I was certain
that you were going to go

01:03.005 --> 01:04.805
Lima Heights Adjacent
and just throw those eggs

01:04.840 --> 01:06.440
on that lady's face just now.

01:06.475 --> 01:07.642
No.

01:07.676 --> 01:08.809
I need this job.

01:08.844 --> 01:10.378
I'm saving up to buy a noose

01:10.412 --> 01:11.546
to hang myself with.

01:11.580 --> 01:12.747
Hey.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.181
Wait, what's going on?
Talk to me.

01:14.216 --> 01:16.417
It's not what I expected,
you know? I'm awesome.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.753
I thought I'd come here and
everyone would see that, too.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.821
Wait, what do you mean?
You got a national commercial

01:20.856 --> 01:22.423
within like a month
of being here.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.892
Yes, and now everywhere I go,
I am known as the girl

01:24.927 --> 01:26.460
with the raging yeast infection.

01:26.495 --> 01:29.196
The other day some customers
made me take their toast back

01:29.231 --> 01:31.365
because looking at me made them
lose their appetite

01:31.400 --> 01:33.000
for any bread products.

01:33.035 --> 01:35.269
I'm sorry I'm complaining.
I'm fine.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.264
No, you're not. Look, it's
okay to complain to me,

01:37.272 --> 01:38.773
It means we're friends.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.142
I just have this weird guilt trip
thing about being friends with you,

01:41.176 --> 01:43.277
because I was so awful
to you in high school.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.580
Quinn and Brit hated you, too,
and that's mostly

01:45.614 --> 01:47.815
just because you sucked so bad
and you walked with that weird

01:47.849 --> 01:49.717
"feet pointing out" thing.

01:49.751 --> 01:51.419
I made Quinn
look like the boss,

01:51.453 --> 01:53.387
but I was really running
the "Hate on Rachel" parade.

01:53.422 --> 01:55.022
It's fine, okay?

01:55.057 --> 01:57.425
I forgive you, and you just
have to forgive yourself.

01:57.459 --> 02:00.061
High school's over and it's just
me, you and Kurt here now.

02:00.095 --> 02:01.929
Yes, and out of all three
of us, I am crapping

02:01.964 --> 02:04.131
the bed the hardest.

02:04.166 --> 02:07.101
I may be on top right now,
but one day it'll be you.

02:07.135 --> 02:09.737
You know, what you need right
now is some good old pampering.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.973
Oh, are you treating at
the Korean spa? Better.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.842
I'm gonna be on the cover
of <i>New York</i> magazine.

02:14.876 --> 02:15.943
Oh, my God.
(squeals)

02:15.978 --> 02:17.178
Oh, my God, that's awesome.

02:17.212 --> 02:18.613
I'm totally pretending
not to be jealous.

02:18.647 --> 02:20.147
No, I'm just kidding,
that's really cool.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.383
Well, it's just something that
the publicist for the show

02:22.417 --> 02:24.986
set up to, like, introduce me
to the world and I just,

02:25.020 --> 02:27.555
I feel like this is my moment
where I've really arrived.

02:27.589 --> 02:29.323
I'm really, really
happy for you.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.592
But what does this have to
do with me being pampered?

02:31.627 --> 02:33.628
Okay, so there's gonna be
models at the shoot and I think

02:33.662 --> 02:35.863
I have enough juice to ask
if you can be one of them.

02:35.897 --> 02:37.765
And you can get, like, get
your hair done and your nails

02:37.799 --> 02:40.334
and your makeup and there's all
these free clothes. Are you in?

02:40.369 --> 02:41.335
(bell dings)

02:41.370 --> 02:42.703
- Hells yes, I'm in.
- Yay.

02:42.738 --> 02:45.573
Right after I spit...

02:45.607 --> 02:47.441
in these eggs.

02:48.477 --> 02:49.677
Heisten.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.979
I really hope that I
can be as cool as you

02:52.014 --> 02:53.948
when the roles are reversed.

02:53.982 --> 02:55.449
You're a really good friend.

03:01.690 --> 03:02.456
(school bell rings)

03:02.491 --> 03:04.025
I'm really proud of us.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.826
- Why's that? - 'Cause
even after you and I

03:05.861 --> 03:08.229
broke up, we were
able to stay friends

03:08.263 --> 03:10.398
and continue our tradition
of Tuesday lunch together.

03:10.432 --> 03:13.934
It's also a good way to avoid
the cafeteria on Taco Tuesdays

03:13.969 --> 03:16.804
when they use Grade "D" prison
meat that can legally contain

03:16.838 --> 03:18.406
up to 5% insect larvae.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.707
Still.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.176
I'm gonna miss this next
year when you're at Brown

03:22.210 --> 03:24.979
and I'm at film school
in Brooklyn.

03:27.315 --> 03:29.483
I got wait-listed at Brown.

03:29.518 --> 03:31.652
Oh, you'll get in. You
know how many students

03:31.687 --> 03:33.120
make it off the wait list?

03:33.155 --> 03:34.388
Two percent.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.957
The only other schools I
applied to were Ohio State

03:36.992 --> 03:38.826
and that dumb vet school.

03:38.860 --> 03:41.362
I really wanted to get out
of this place, you know?

03:41.396 --> 03:43.731
Expand my horizons.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.700
I don't think that's
in the cards for me now.

03:45.734 --> 03:46.901
Well, listen.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.236
We have, what, a couple
more Tuesdays at McKinley?

03:49.271 --> 03:51.072
<i>Let's make them count.</i>

03:51.106 --> 03:52.673
<i>From now until graduation,</i>

03:52.708 --> 03:55.876
<i>Tuesday lunch is about music</i>
<i>that'll cheer you up</i>

03:55.911 --> 03:57.278
because the only thing
you'll be doing next year

03:57.312 --> 03:59.747
is knitting scarves for those
chilly Ivy League winters.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.450
That's a really
flimsy segue, Artie.

help you with something?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.867
Yeah, quit staring at my boobs.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.002
Tina, Artie...
Principal Sylvester

06:02.037 --> 06:04.205
wants to see you in her office.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.241
(school bell rings)

06:07.275 --> 06:08.442
Stumbles.

06:08.476 --> 06:10.477
Tina Warrior Princess.

06:10.512 --> 06:12.112
Graduation is fast approaching

06:12.147 --> 06:13.781
and it is time
to award the title

06:13.815 --> 06:16.884
of Senior class valedictorian.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.453
Now, as you are,
respectively, a loner Asian

06:19.487 --> 06:21.088
who has trouble making friends

06:21.122 --> 06:22.756
and a nasal,
Muppety disabled kid

06:22.791 --> 06:25.292
in a wheelchair, it should
come as no surprise

06:25.327 --> 06:27.862
to you both that you're
at the head of your class.

06:27.896 --> 06:29.597
In fact...

06:29.631 --> 06:30.931
you're tied for number one.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.299
Tied? How is that possible?

06:32.334 --> 06:33.968
Identical GPAs,

06:34.002 --> 06:35.202
extracurriculars,

06:35.237 --> 06:37.438
and you both have
perfect attendance.

06:37.472 --> 06:40.608
Now, unlike some members
of the Glee Club who come and go

06:40.642 --> 06:42.743
for months at a time
with no explanation,

06:42.777 --> 06:46.647
you two losers are
always in that choir room.

06:46.681 --> 06:49.116
Even if, for an entire week,
the only thing you have to do

06:49.150 --> 06:50.751
is say something
inconsequential, like,

06:50.785 --> 06:51.952
"Kitty's right,"

06:51.987 --> 06:54.154
or "Blaine,
are you serious?"

06:54.189 --> 06:56.323
Wait, we can't both
be valedictorian.

06:56.358 --> 06:57.591
Not in my world.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.793
And that is why we're
going to settle this

06:59.828 --> 07:02.029
with a friendly
little competition.

07:02.931 --> 07:05.399
As you know, the valedictorian

07:05.433 --> 07:07.434
gives the speech at graduation.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.169
At the end of this week,

07:09.204 --> 07:12.039
you will both
deliver your speeches

07:12.073 --> 07:15.542
to a blue ribbon panel
of idiots of my choosing.

07:15.577 --> 07:16.710
Whoever wins...

07:16.745 --> 07:18.445
will be crowned valedictorian.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.914
That sound fair?

07:19.948 --> 07:21.181
No, actually, it doesn't.

07:21.216 --> 07:23.517
Life isn't fair, Abrams.

07:23.551 --> 07:25.119
Good, then it's settled.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.855
Oh, and, uh, let this stand
as a warning to you both.

07:27.889 --> 07:29.957
If during one of your speeches,

07:29.991 --> 07:32.860
you decide to abandon
your prepared text

07:32.894 --> 07:35.296
in favor of a musical number,
because the emotions

07:35.330 --> 07:37.197
you're feeling
are just so complex

07:37.232 --> 07:39.066
they can only
be expressed in song,

07:39.100 --> 07:41.936
I promise you I will dedicate
my life to making sure

07:41.970 --> 07:45.005
that every beverage you drink,
until the day you die,

07:45.040 --> 07:46.507
will have a just a...

07:46.541 --> 07:49.009
tiny, little bit
of my pee in it.

07:49.044 --> 07:50.544

07:50.578 --> 07:53.447
Oh, my God, can you believe
all the amazing dresses

07:53.481 --> 07:54.815
that they pulled
for this shoot?

07:54.849 --> 07:56.717
And all these girls
are like the new up-and-comers

07:56.751 --> 07:58.218
from Juilliard and Harvard and Yale.
Mm-hmm.

07:58.253 --> 08:00.220
Okay, that girl over there... look,
but don't really look... Oh.

08:00.255 --> 08:01.789
She just got the lead
on AMC's new show

08:01.823 --> 08:03.223
about Victorian prostitutes.

08:03.258 --> 08:05.092
I'm so nervous, but I'm nervous
because I'm excited

08:05.126 --> 08:07.161
or because I'm scared, this is so amazing.
Berry, Berry.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.295
You look amazing.
Okay.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.563
Own it.
All right.

08:09.597 --> 08:11.231
You are exactly where
you're supposed to be.

08:11.266 --> 08:12.433
- Thank you.
- Okay, good luck.

08:12.467 --> 08:13.567
Okay, here I go.

08:13.601 --> 08:15.235
- Tell me if I look good.

Santana.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.277
Come on.

10:37.312 --> 10:38.879
Go to wardrobe, get dressed.

10:40.548 --> 10:42.216
Okay.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.684
(school bell rings)

10:43.718 --> 10:45.752
No need to write a speech.
I wrote it for you.

10:45.787 --> 10:48.021
"In the hallowed halls
of McKinley High,

10:48.056 --> 10:51.558
"one name rises to the top:
Tina Cohen-Chang.

10:51.593 --> 10:53.894
"There is no other choice
for valedictorian.

10:53.928 --> 10:55.762
I humbly drop out."

10:55.797 --> 10:57.030
<i>No me gusta.</i>

10:57.065 --> 10:58.999
Artie, I need valedictorian

10:59.033 --> 11:00.634
in order to guarantee
my acceptance to Brown.

11:00.668 --> 11:01.868
If I don't get in, I'm screwed.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.303
Please take the fall for me.

11:03.338 --> 11:05.506
No. It's not my fault you didn't
apply to enough schools.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.175
Maybe I was too busy making
costumes and building sets

11:08.209 --> 11:10.043
and swaying in the background
while everybody else

11:10.078 --> 11:11.545
was front and center.
You always get

11:11.579 --> 11:13.714
everything you want,
and I get nothing.

11:13.748 --> 11:16.150
Woman, are you insane?
You just won Prom Queen.

11:16.184 --> 11:17.451
Which counts against me.

11:17.485 --> 11:19.052
I read online
that college admission directors

11:19.087 --> 11:20.521
think that high school
Prom Queens

11:20.555 --> 11:22.055
are self-centered
attention whores.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.223
Exactly.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.458
Excuse me?

11:25.493 --> 11:26.860
It's time you heard this.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.228
The whole school's
been talking about it.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.898
Everyone's convinced
that sometime between junior

11:30.932 --> 11:32.833
and senior year,
an alien invaded your body

11:32.867 --> 11:34.234
and made you shallow
and desperate.

11:34.269 --> 11:36.036
Says the nerd
who's dating a Cheerio!

11:36.070 --> 11:38.705
Says the hag
who vapo-raped Blaine.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.440
That was blown totally out
of proportion, and, yeah,

11:40.475 --> 11:42.442
I had a little crush on a guy
who could never love me,

11:42.477 --> 11:43.777
but is that any different

11:43.811 --> 11:45.712
than you having a crush
on a girl who can't possibly

11:45.747 --> 11:46.613
love you?

11:46.648 --> 11:48.015
Kitty does love me.

11:48.049 --> 11:50.017
Please.
She's obviously using you

11:50.051 --> 11:52.486
for some kind
of sick charity project,

11:52.520 --> 11:54.421
and you're using her, too.

11:54.455 --> 11:56.023
That's what your speech
can be about,

11:56.057 --> 11:59.026
how you're making a sad,
last-ditch effort to be popular

11:59.060 --> 12:01.361
by dating
McKinley's biggest bitch.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.865
Actually, Tina,
you're McKinley's biggest bitch.

12:04.899 --> 12:06.233
And I'm gonna win this.

12:13.049 --> 12:16.446
I don't know, Kurt, don't you
think you might be overreacting?

12:16.471 --> 12:18.438
If anything, I'm underreacting.

12:18.473 --> 12:20.707
Starchild is trying
to take over the band.

12:20.742 --> 12:23.376
The soul of Pamela Lansbury
is hanging in the balance.

12:23.411 --> 12:25.178
It all started when Elliott
scored an interview

12:25.213 --> 12:27.514
in <i>The Village Voice,</i>
and he said,

12:27.548 --> 12:29.649
"I feel so alive right now.

12:29.684 --> 12:31.651
Nothing means more to me
than my band."

12:31.686 --> 12:35.255
That's great, isn't it? He's
calling it <i>his</i> band, Blaine.

12:35.289 --> 12:37.657
And then, not five minutes ago,
do I get a text from him

12:37.692 --> 12:39.126
that says, "Oh, my God,

12:39.160 --> 12:41.328
I just wrote a new song
that we have"... in all caps...

12:41.362 --> 12:44.931
"got to do."
I mean, he's a psychopath.

12:44.966 --> 12:47.134
Kurt, I gotta go. But, look,
if you're really concerned

12:47.168 --> 12:49.536
about Elliot, don't let on,
even for a second.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.738
Remember the old adage,
keep your friends close

12:51.773 --> 12:53.073
and your enemies closer.

12:53.107 --> 12:54.808
I love you.

12:56.711 --> 12:59.813
All right, ladies, remember,
we got band rehearsal tonight.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.415
Kurt, I'm sorry,
I just... I can't.

13:02.450 --> 13:03.917
- What?
- Wait, what? Why?

13:03.951 --> 13:06.052
Santana, don't start
with me right now.

13:06.087 --> 13:07.754
They're auditioning
my understudy today,

13:07.789 --> 13:10.590
and I have to be there.
I told them it's ridiculous

13:10.625 --> 13:12.859
because it's not like I'm ever
gonna miss a performance

13:12.894 --> 13:15.662
or anything. Just... It must be
an insurance thing, right?

13:15.696 --> 13:18.498
Hey, well, hold up. If Berry's
not coming, then neither am I.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.901
Guys, we're in a band.
We have to practice.

13:20.935 --> 13:22.736
Kurt, I would think
that you would understand

13:22.770 --> 13:24.738
all the emotional stress
that I'm under right now,

13:24.772 --> 13:27.407
and I need you guys to just
be a little supportive.

13:27.441 --> 13:31.978
It's just...
it's really hard being a star.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.884
Okay, guys, it's coming down
to the wire.

13:37.919 --> 13:39.686
We have a very important
decision to make.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.522
Yes, my wig is either gonna be
Anna Wintour chic

13:42.557 --> 13:43.723
or Pam Grier fabulousness.

13:43.758 --> 13:45.492
I'm not ready
to make the decision.

13:45.526 --> 13:48.395
Okay. So, we have two solos
at nationals.

13:48.429 --> 13:50.096
And since Blaine
was voted the new Rachel,

13:50.131 --> 13:52.098
obviously he's got one.
So...

13:52.133 --> 13:53.967
who is gonna step up
and take center stage?

13:54.001 --> 13:56.036
I'd like to nominate myself.

13:56.070 --> 13:57.704
Shocker.
And you think you're gonna

13:57.738 --> 13:59.606
carry us to victory?
Actually, Mr. Shue,

13:59.640 --> 14:01.708
I think I'd like to compete
with Tina for that second spot.

14:01.742 --> 14:04.544
Well, I think we should have a
sing-off, right here, right now.

14:04.579 --> 14:05.679

There, buddy.
It's fine.

16:20.081 --> 16:22.082
I'm fine.

16:23.084 --> 16:24.884
(sighs)

16:24.919 --> 16:27.520
(school bell rings)

16:27.555 --> 16:30.123
When the girls bailed,
I almost canceled rehearsal,

16:30.157 --> 16:32.959
but then I thought, why can't
it just be the boys today?

16:32.994 --> 16:35.295
Why not use this
as a great opportunity

16:35.329 --> 16:37.430
to get to know
my new friend Elliott?

16:37.465 --> 16:39.933
- Cucumber sandwich?
- Thank you. Yeah.

16:39.967 --> 16:43.069
So, let's break it down,
Andy Cohen-style.

16:43.104 --> 16:45.705
How long have you been
performing?

16:45.740 --> 16:47.874
'Cause you are
extremely confident

16:47.908 --> 16:49.409
out there on that stage.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.611
Like you've been doing it
your whole life.

16:51.645 --> 16:54.080
A-And dare I say it? You just
might be the breakout star

16:54.115 --> 16:55.081
of Pamela Lansbury.

16:55.116 --> 16:56.583
(distorted):
Yeah, well, I am.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.151
Sorry?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.719
Come on now. I mean...
(stammers)

16:59.754 --> 17:01.654
everybody's bringing
something essential to the mix.

17:01.689 --> 17:04.491
Right, right. Said Beyoncé right
before she left Destiny's Child.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.060
She was better...
But you were saying something.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.896
Um, yeah, I guess the first time
onstage was... fifth grade.

17:09.930 --> 17:12.165
I played Schroeder in <i>You're</i>
<i>a Good Man, Charlie Brown.</i>

17:12.199 --> 17:14.666
How does one go
from Schroeder to Starchild?

17:14.702 --> 17:17.069
What is that journey like?
Well...

17:17.104 --> 17:20.507
Ruthless and-and full of
ambition, I-I, I imagine...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.442
qualities that I admire,
of course, and, you know,

17:22.476 --> 17:24.176
wish I had more of myself.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.313
Um, I started with, um,
singing lessons and piano.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.282
And-and I just started
taking guitar.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.885
Would you teach me?
Have you ever played?

17:31.919 --> 17:34.788
Oh, yeah, a little. I-I think
I know the-the basic chords,

17:34.822 --> 17:37.791
but I'm nowhere near your level
of virtuosity.

17:37.825 --> 17:40.894
I'm not that good. Oh, will you
stop downplaying yourself?

17:40.928 --> 17:44.898
You... are amazing.

17:44.932 --> 17:47.567
You could easily be
the front man of our band

17:47.601 --> 17:48.835
if you wanted to be. Do you?

17:48.869 --> 17:50.303
(distorted):
Yes.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.072
Come again?

17:52.106 --> 17:55.475
You know, Kurt, uh,
if you really want to learn,

17:55.509 --> 17:57.143
you should... you should get
your own guitar.

17:57.178 --> 17:59.879
You know, something
that suits your personality

17:59.914 --> 18:02.215
and your style. You know,
having the right instrument

18:02.249 --> 18:03.650
makes a huge difference.

18:03.684 --> 18:05.752
Great.

18:05.786 --> 18:09.022
(harshly off-key):
♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪

18:09.056 --> 18:13.426
♪ Wake unto me... ♪

18:13.461 --> 18:15.762
RUPERT:
Thank you.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.063

18:17.098 --> 18:19.065
Thank you.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.934
Woof.

18:20.968 --> 18:23.203
I mean, no wonder you
hired me for this part.

18:23.237 --> 18:24.871
No one can sing in this town.

18:24.905 --> 18:28.208
I hired you
because you are spectacular.

18:28.242 --> 18:29.709
And incredibly healthy.

18:29.743 --> 18:31.344
I plan on wearing one
of those surgical masks

18:31.378 --> 18:32.879
that Chinese people wear
once we're up and running

18:32.913 --> 18:34.247
because I do not get sick,

18:34.281 --> 18:35.982
which is why I don't
need an understudy.

18:36.016 --> 18:37.650
The union says
you need an understudy.

18:37.685 --> 18:40.453
So does the producer, so does
our insurance company, so do I.

18:40.488 --> 18:42.722
Fine. How many more
people do we have left?

18:42.756 --> 18:44.457
Just a few.

We're roommates, and we went

both of you?

tell me about her?

we're doing this, Elliott.

we could second-act <i>Pippin.</i>

Ooh. And we can go to Angus's

You don't own the song.

No, that song is
Ms. Streisand's

25:02.552 --> 25:03.919
as long as she's on this planet.

25:03.954 --> 25:05.488
But let me tell you
something... when she goes,

25:05.522 --> 25:07.490
it's gonna be my responsibility
to sing it.

25:07.524 --> 25:08.858
Do you know how insane
you sound?

25:08.892 --> 25:10.993
It was completely
inappropriate of her

25:11.027 --> 25:12.187
to try out without telling me.

25:12.195 --> 25:15.397
Hey, roomies.
Talking about me?

25:15.432 --> 25:16.592
No. Why would you think that?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.733
Why did you audition
without telling me?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.935
Well, because I figured

25:19.970 --> 25:22.238
that we were going
to fight about it, anyway,

25:22.272 --> 25:23.772
so we might as well
go at it afterwards.

25:23.807 --> 25:25.508
That way you don't have
a chance to torpedo me.

25:25.542 --> 25:28.577
Fanny Brice is a New York Jew.
You playing that role is

25:28.612 --> 25:30.813
like me being the grand marshal
at the Puerto Rican Day parade.

25:30.847 --> 25:32.181
What if you weren't
playing Fanny?

25:32.215 --> 25:34.650
If you weren't playing the lead,
and I came home and said

25:34.684 --> 25:36.364
that I had auditioned
to be the understudy,

25:36.386 --> 25:37.720
would you still feel
so strongly?

25:37.754 --> 25:40.222
I'm arguing on principle.
This is not personal.

25:40.257 --> 25:41.557
Bull crap, Rachel.

25:41.591 --> 25:44.093
You have all of this talk about
forgiveness for high school,

25:44.127 --> 25:46.195
but the reality is
that you just love having

25:46.229 --> 25:47.796
something over me.
I mean, these past

25:47.831 --> 25:49.331
couple of months
with you in rehearsal

25:49.366 --> 25:53.035
and me waiting tables has been
such sweet revenge for you.

25:53.069 --> 25:56.105
And you just can't stand the
idea that I might get mine, too.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.474
I just got you on the cover
of <i>New York</i> magazine!

25:58.508 --> 26:00.776
In the background. You were
practically glowing about it.

26:00.810 --> 26:02.444
That's because
I accomplished something.

26:02.479 --> 26:03.879
It had nothing to do with you.

26:03.914 --> 26:06.582
No, see, it actually has
everything to do with me.

26:06.616 --> 26:08.984
Every step that you take
in this city is fueled

26:09.019 --> 26:11.353
by all of the hate
that we gave you.

26:11.388 --> 26:14.156
All of that ambition is just
you trying to prove us wrong.

26:14.191 --> 26:15.958
Which is fine, Rachel.
I mean, whatever works for you.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.526
Just don't try
to say that it isn't.

26:17.561 --> 26:19.094
You know what? Why don't we just
chill for a second, please.

26:19.129 --> 26:20.896
Okay, I'll make espresso.
You know what?

26:20.931 --> 26:22.198
You can't handle it.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.166
You can't handle
that I have made it,

26:24.201 --> 26:26.735
and you are just begging
to be my understudy.

26:27.771 --> 26:29.972
Okay, you know what?

26:30.006 --> 26:32.374
Just admit that even with all
of your years of singing lessons

26:32.409 --> 26:35.878
and dancing lessons and
only-child adoration

26:35.912 --> 26:37.479
from your gay
Broadway dads that I

26:37.514 --> 26:39.448
am just as good as you.

26:39.482 --> 26:42.151
Unlike you, I can be popular
in high school and still

26:42.185 --> 26:43.419
make it big after graduation.

26:43.453 --> 26:45.621
Just admit that no matter
what you do,

26:45.655 --> 26:47.189
or how far you go,

26:47.224 --> 26:48.958
you will never be able
to scratch that itch.

26:48.992 --> 26:52.061
You will never be able to look
down on me and redeem yourself.

26:52.095 --> 26:53.696
Because I was better
than you then,

26:53.730 --> 26:55.364
and I'm always gonna
be better than you.

26:55.398 --> 26:57.299
You are short,
you are awful, and

26:57.334 --> 26:58.667
that is never going to change.

I feel like I was
a different person

28:23.820 --> 28:27.122
when I first arrived at McKinley
High School four years ago.

28:27.157 --> 28:29.224
I was a goth chick

28:29.259 --> 28:32.394
who was so intent
on pushing people away

28:32.429 --> 28:34.630
that I pretended
to have a stutter,

28:34.664 --> 28:37.800
which I now understand
wasn't even that convincing.

28:37.834 --> 28:39.334

28:39.369 --> 28:41.069

29:04.694 --> 29:06.161
Ditto.

29:06.196 --> 29:09.231
Artie has taught me
how to not only be myself,

29:09.265 --> 29:11.200
but he's an inspiration to
high school students everywhere.

29:11.234 --> 29:13.235
ARTIE: <i>Sure, I've
experienced adversity.</i>

29:13.269 --> 29:15.404
One Christmas, I was given
a pair of mechanical legs

29:15.438 --> 29:17.739
that allowed me to walk for an
hour before they promptly broke.

29:17.774 --> 29:20.008
But I've never been so humbled
as I was

29:20.043 --> 29:22.544
the moment Tina Cohen-Chang
wiped the slushie off

29:22.579 --> 29:24.880
of her gown and triumphantly
returned to the stage

29:24.914 --> 29:26.882
to claim her rightful crown
as prom queen.

29:26.916 --> 29:28.984
That is why I respectfully

29:29.018 --> 29:30.385
withdraw myself
from consideration,

29:30.420 --> 29:32.354
and ask that Tina be named
this year's valedictorian.

29:32.388 --> 29:35.357
I believe he should be given the
title of class valedictorian.

29:35.391 --> 29:37.059
(sniffling)
God, this can't be happening.

29:37.093 --> 29:38.360
TINA:
Is it a bridge too far

29:38.394 --> 29:40.662
to call Artie Abrams
an American hero?

29:40.697 --> 29:42.130
I think not.

29:42.165 --> 29:44.399
ARTIE:
<i>It's no exaggeration to say</i>

29:44.434 --> 29:45.801
that Tina took my broken body
in her arms

29:45.835 --> 29:47.169
and taught me how to love.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.905
And as he strains to push
his wheelchair up that ramp,

29:49.939 --> 29:52.741
the ghosts of fallen heroes
follow close behind.

29:52.775 --> 29:55.978
Rosa Parks, Mahatma Gandhi.

29:56.012 --> 29:59.248
Artie Abrams holds high
the torch of dignity.

29:59.282 --> 30:02.518
So please, respected judges,
cast your lot for Tina.

30:02.552 --> 30:05.120
I beseech you, vote for Artie.

30:05.154 --> 30:08.891
Tina Cohen-Chang, teammate,
sometime lover,

30:08.925 --> 30:11.159
patriot, friend.

30:11.194 --> 30:13.228
Thank you.

30:13.263 --> 30:14.396
Thank you.

30:14.430 --> 30:15.631
What a treacly, stomach-turning

30:15.665 --> 30:18.433
waste of everybody's time.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.002
I hate you both.

30:20.036 --> 30:22.671
The judges will now make
their decision

30:22.705 --> 30:24.673
while I find a
wastebasket to dry-heave

30:24.707 --> 30:27.809
mouthfuls of yellow bile into.

30:41.991 --> 30:43.458
What are you doing?

30:43.493 --> 30:44.793
Putting makeup on.

30:44.827 --> 30:46.228
I have some bruising on my cheek

30:46.262 --> 30:47.742
I'd like to cover up
before rehearsal.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.565
You may not know this because
you haven't been interested

30:49.599 --> 30:50.899
in Broadway
since the day we met,

30:50.934 --> 30:52.367
but the star gets
her own vanity.

30:52.402 --> 30:53.502
There is a perfectly fine

30:53.536 --> 30:55.404
bathroom mirror upstairs
for the understudy.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.606
So sorry, I totally forgot
how much room you need

30:57.640 --> 30:59.841
for all that hooker makeup
you plaster on every day.

30:59.876 --> 31:01.343
I will totally slap you again.

31:01.377 --> 31:03.178
I would love for things
to get physical.

31:03.212 --> 31:05.147
I will hit you so hard that
you won't be able to wake up

31:05.181 --> 31:07.449
until you're old enough
to be <i>Funny Lady.</i>

31:07.483 --> 31:09.117
You will never play this part;
I know you're planning

31:09.152 --> 31:10.953
on getting all <i>Showgirls</i> crazy
on me and pushing me

31:10.987 --> 31:12.154
down the stairs
and poisoning my oatmeal,

31:12.188 --> 31:13.522
but you're gonna have
to kill me first,

31:13.556 --> 31:15.316
and even then,
I will come back from the dead

31:15.325 --> 31:17.526
and I will play this part
just to spite you.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.527
Zombie Fanny?

31:18.561 --> 31:20.295
Ghost Fanny, actually.

31:20.330 --> 31:21.630
What's this?

31:21.664 --> 31:23.532
Fighting? No, no, no.

31:23.566 --> 31:24.833
No way, no fighting.

31:24.867 --> 31:26.368
Okay, Rupert,
this isn't gonna work.

31:26.402 --> 31:27.936
Santana and I have a past.

31:27.971 --> 31:30.272
Which besides her
being incredibly talented,

31:30.306 --> 31:31.473
is why she is here.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.775
If you want to fill this house,

31:33.810 --> 31:35.243
we need all the press
we can get.

31:35.278 --> 31:36.912
I've got Pat Healy
from the <i>New York Times,</i>

31:36.946 --> 31:38.614
David Cote from <i>Time Out,</i>

31:38.648 --> 31:39.748
Adam Hetrick

31:39.782 --> 31:42.417
from playbill.com
all begging me

31:42.452 --> 31:44.052
to break the story
of the two girls

31:44.087 --> 31:45.487
from the same high school
in Ohio

31:45.521 --> 31:47.522
who made it big in the
same Broadway show.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.257
Two old friends

31:49.292 --> 31:53.128
finding fame, love and fortune
in the big city. Hell of a hook.

31:53.162 --> 31:56.531
You're both gonna get plenty
of attention individually,

31:56.566 --> 31:59.234
but it is a fact, as a team,

31:59.268 --> 32:01.203
you'll be twice as famous.

32:01.237 --> 32:03.572
From now on, I want the two
of you joined at the hip.

32:03.606 --> 32:05.574
You both need to know every
move Fanny makes in the show,

32:05.608 --> 32:06.875
starting with scene 14.

32:06.909 --> 32:09.444
Rachel, you'll run through
it first, then Santana.

32:09.479 --> 32:10.519
I don't know what happened

32:10.546 --> 32:11.813
between the two of
you in the past.

32:11.848 --> 32:13.115
Honestly, I don't really care.

32:13.149 --> 32:15.884
It's all...
puppy dogs and rainbows

32:15.918 --> 32:18.487
from now till this show closes.

32:19.489 --> 32:21.089
(sighs heavily)

32:22.959 --> 32:24.826
Well...

32:24.861 --> 32:26.428
at least we know who
the rainbow is,

32:26.462 --> 32:27.963
and who's the dog.

32:27.997 --> 32:30.098
Bathroom's upstairs!

Ah, T. Rex?

Oh, be still my glam heart.

35:16.833 --> 35:19.568
You know, there's this amazing
flea market in Park Slope

35:19.602 --> 35:20.735
- that we should go to.
- Ooh.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.204
I will help you pick out

35:22.238 --> 35:24.372
the perfect records
to add to your collection.

35:24.407 --> 35:25.740
I'm, uh, kind of magic
like that.

35:25.775 --> 35:29.244
And I am kind of magic
at baking prepackaged goods

35:29.278 --> 35:30.946
with extra glazing.

35:30.980 --> 35:32.380
- Aw...
- Yes!

35:32.415 --> 35:33.615
That looks amazing.

35:33.649 --> 35:35.884
(chuckles)

35:35.918 --> 35:37.118
You know, Kurt...

35:37.153 --> 35:39.221
you know, this might sound
a little bit weird,

35:39.255 --> 35:41.890
but, um, I'm so glad
that we've met.

35:41.924 --> 35:43.391
I mean,

35:43.426 --> 35:44.759
you're the first gay friend
that I've made

35:44.794 --> 35:46.127
in the city that's not crazy

35:46.162 --> 35:48.496
or just trying to hook up.

35:48.531 --> 35:50.799
But I do know what you're doing.

35:50.833 --> 35:53.134
What's that?

35:53.169 --> 35:55.937
I'm not trying
to take over you band, man.

35:55.972 --> 35:57.672
That's what
you're thinking, right?

35:57.707 --> 36:00.107
I mean, that's why we've been
spending so much time together?

36:01.978 --> 36:03.178
You are kind of magic.

36:03.212 --> 36:04.746
I'm sorry,
I-I just wanted to,

36:04.780 --> 36:05.847
you know, figure out,

36:05.882 --> 36:07.215
exactly what your deal was.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.617
Well, the deal is this.

36:08.651 --> 36:10.952
You guys are awesome.

36:10.987 --> 36:12.954
You're good people,
you're talented

36:12.989 --> 36:14.723
and, you know what?
So am I.

36:14.757 --> 36:17.225
So let's not be
these, like, smiley frenemies

36:17.260 --> 36:18.360
that backstab each other.

36:18.394 --> 36:20.662
Let's go out
and kick ass together.

36:20.696 --> 36:23.498
I mean, I'm a part of your band.

36:23.532 --> 36:26.368
Yeah, you are.

36:26.402 --> 36:27.369
Okay, let's document
this moment.

36:27.403 --> 36:28.503
Shall we? Great.
Yes, yes.

36:28.537 --> 36:30.417
I think this calls
for a Pamela Lansbury selfie.

36:33.276 --> 36:34.910
Oh! See...
I was still chewing.

36:34.944 --> 36:36.444
Oh, sorry, let's take
a look, it could be...

36:36.479 --> 36:37.979
Yeah, no, we're doing
that again...

36:38.014 --> 36:39.781
Yeah, that's awful.
We're going that again, okay?

36:39.815 --> 36:41.549
One, two... Be super cute.

36:43.019 --> 36:45.086
Aw, cute!
(laughs)

36:45.121 --> 36:47.255
(gasps) Oh!

36:47.290 --> 36:49.591
(school bell ringing)

36:49.625 --> 36:51.726
Well, the judges have spoken.

36:51.761 --> 36:53.461
And?
Congratulations, morons.

36:53.496 --> 36:55.096
You split the vote.
It's a tie.

36:55.131 --> 36:56.131
Are you serious?

36:56.165 --> 36:58.133
Yes, I am, Make-a-Wish.

36:58.167 --> 36:59.801
Now I have no choice

36:59.835 --> 37:01.469
but to make you
co-salutatorians.

37:01.504 --> 37:03.805
And elevate the student
ranked number three

37:03.839 --> 37:05.140
to the class valedictorian.

37:05.174 --> 37:06.141
Who?

37:06.175 --> 37:07.642
Blaine Anderson.

37:07.677 --> 37:09.210
What?
What?!

37:09.245 --> 37:11.846
I'm really sorry, guys.
I feel terrible.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.648
Don't be, if we can't
be valedictorian,

37:13.683 --> 37:14.716
we're glad it's you.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.351
No, but you two deserve it.

37:16.385 --> 37:18.553
I mean, come on, you guys have
a higher grade point average.

37:18.587 --> 37:20.221
I know this sounds
like a humble brag.

37:20.256 --> 37:21.489
But honestly,
I feel like sometimes

37:21.524 --> 37:23.191
things just get handed to me.

37:24.226 --> 37:26.127
Really? Hmm.
I never noticed that.

37:26.162 --> 37:27.429
You know, like, how Mr. Shue

37:27.463 --> 37:28.797
gives me more solos
than anyone, and...

37:28.831 --> 37:30.432
BECKY:
Blade gay Blaine!

37:30.466 --> 37:33.001
When did you break-up
with Pancake Face?

37:33.035 --> 37:34.669
Uh, Becky, I'd really
appreciate it

37:34.704 --> 37:38.239
if you didn't call my
fiancé "Pancake Face."

37:38.274 --> 37:40.241
And no, we're not broken up.

37:40.276 --> 37:43.011
Yeah, you are.

37:43.045 --> 37:45.046
(quietly):
What?

37:47.683 --> 37:51.386
Um, that's a...
that's a great photo, Becky.

37:51.420 --> 37:53.288
But don't worry.

37:53.322 --> 37:54.356
Kurt and Elliot are
just friends.

37:54.390 --> 37:56.091
Just friends, my ass.

37:56.125 --> 37:58.893
Speaking of ass...

37:58.928 --> 37:59.928
Pancake Face is getting some.

37:59.962 --> 38:01.963
Oh, snap!

38:01.998 --> 38:04.299
(weak laugh)

38:08.762 --> 38:10.702
Tina and Artie have both
demurred from having solos

38:10.727 --> 38:12.294
at Nationals,
so we're still looking

38:12.329 --> 38:13.596
for someone to step up.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.631
Uh, Mr. Shue?
You already have a solo, Blaine.

38:15.665 --> 38:17.099
Thank you, Tina.

38:17.134 --> 38:19.769
This is about something else.

38:19.803 --> 38:21.103
As you may have all heard,

38:21.138 --> 38:23.105
I have been asked, oddly,

38:23.140 --> 38:25.174
to be valedictorian this year.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.942
And so, I thought,
instead of boring everybody

38:26.977 --> 38:28.611
with the traditional
valedictorian speech

38:28.645 --> 38:30.246
where I tell people to follow
their dreams

38:30.280 --> 38:31.714
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

38:31.748 --> 38:33.249
I could actually affect people
by singing.

38:33.283 --> 38:34.683
So I was hoping
you guys could help me

38:34.718 --> 38:36.786
brainstorm
some graduation songs.

38:36.820 --> 38:38.120
I cannot wait to watch

38:38.155 --> 38:40.156
Principal Sylvester
assassinate you.

38:42.893 --> 38:45.895
Look, I know you guys
both really wanted it.

38:47.164 --> 38:49.165
That's why I want both
of you to sing with me.

38:49.199 --> 38:52.268
Whatever song we pick,
we should pick together.

38:52.302 --> 38:53.836
And you should both
definitely have solos.

38:53.870 --> 38:55.437
And, Tina, we could
film rehearsal

38:55.472 --> 38:56.605
and send it to Brown.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.274
And they're so artsy
and progressive

38:58.308 --> 39:00.042
that I'm sure once they see it,
they're just gonna open up

39:00.076 --> 39:01.677
those Van Winkle gates,
looking for you.

39:01.711 --> 39:03.879
They better open them
really wide.

39:03.914 --> 39:05.281
Oh, Blainy Days.

39:05.315 --> 39:06.982
Well, if we're gonna go down,

39:07.017 --> 39:09.118
I'm honored to go
down together.

39:09.152 --> 39:10.653
Yes! Right! That's
that spirit I like!

39:10.687 --> 39:12.354
(all chatting happily)

39:12.389 --> 39:14.056
We all can't live here anymore.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.457
One of us has to go.

39:15.492 --> 39:16.992
I've paid rent here
for three months.

39:17.027 --> 39:19.495
And even though I never
actually got to have a bed,

39:19.529 --> 39:21.096
uh, I have squatter's rights.

39:21.131 --> 39:22.431
Kurt, you're the deciding vote.

39:22.465 --> 39:24.200
Oh, well, then I guess
I should pack my stuff now.

39:24.234 --> 39:25.701
'Cause we all know who he's
gonna side with. Right.

39:25.735 --> 39:27.403
Thank you.
I'm thinking neither of you.

39:27.437 --> 39:29.371
Okay? This is ridiculous!
We are friends.

39:29.406 --> 39:31.207
I'm not gonna let something
like this break us up.

39:31.241 --> 39:32.675
This is betrayal, Kurt, okay?

39:32.709 --> 39:34.710
This is exactly how
friends break up.

39:34.744 --> 39:36.779
She auditioned for
your understudy, Rachel.

39:36.813 --> 39:38.380
How is that betrayal?
Okay, you know what?

39:38.415 --> 39:40.349
Let me break it down for you...
the sole purpose

39:40.383 --> 39:41.817
of an understudy is to hope

39:41.852 --> 39:43.752
that the lead never goes on.

39:43.787 --> 39:45.054
She only wins if I lose!

39:45.088 --> 39:46.822
And I can't be around this
negative energy anymore.

39:46.857 --> 39:49.058
This is my big break
and she is poisoning it!

39:49.092 --> 39:50.593
"Poison."

39:50.627 --> 39:51.894
Even if she never went out
on that stage,

39:51.928 --> 39:53.696
this would be
a very important job for her.

39:53.730 --> 39:54.964
And I'm a little disappointed
you can't find

39:54.998 --> 39:56.232
the generosity
in your heart to see that.

39:56.266 --> 39:57.766
You know what? If you think

39:57.801 --> 39:59.635
that she is just some babe

39:59.669 --> 40:01.170
in the woods
who is perfectly fine

40:01.204 --> 40:04.206
with living off of the scraps
off of my star sandwich,

40:04.241 --> 40:06.542
then you are naive
and willfully ignorant!

40:06.576 --> 40:08.244
She would kill for this part!

40:08.278 --> 40:09.645
Oh, yes, she has been
awful to us before.

40:09.679 --> 40:10.813
But I believe her now.

40:10.847 --> 40:12.615
Look at that,
Pasty Gay is siding with me.

40:12.649 --> 40:13.883
I am not siding
with either of you.

40:13.917 --> 40:15.077
I just want to order a pizza,

40:15.085 --> 40:16.318
sit down and talk this out!

40:16.353 --> 40:18.254
You know what?

40:18.288 --> 40:20.155
You guys can do whatever
you want in this apartment,

40:20.190 --> 40:22.791
because I'm leaving, and let me
tell you something, Santana.

40:22.826 --> 40:24.927
You and I have just been
pretending to be friends

40:24.961 --> 40:27.229
ever since we did that
stupid number in the choir room

40:27.264 --> 40:29.698
after graduation,
all happy and supportive.

40:29.733 --> 40:30.900
But it's all crap!

40:30.934 --> 40:32.534
Because you and I have
never been friends.

40:32.569 --> 40:35.271
Never have and never will be!

40:35.305 --> 40:37.139
Rachel, no.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.441
No. No, you know what?
Let her go.

40:39.476 --> 40:42.878
Hey, leave the mattress though,
would you?

40:43.880 --> 40:45.314
I am on the cusp

40:45.348 --> 40:47.483
of something that most people
never even touch,

40:47.517 --> 40:48.584
a dream come true.

40:48.618 --> 40:50.219
I am gonna be
a star on Broadway.

40:50.253 --> 40:52.021
And I'm not gonna let one moment

40:52.055 --> 40:54.623
of this amazing,
life-altering experience

40:54.658 --> 40:58.060
be ruined by two friends
who aren't even my friends...

40:58.094 --> 40:59.728
That's it.

40:59.763 --> 41:01.130
I'm done. I'm leaving.
Okay. Cool.

41:01.164 --> 41:02.998
(Kurt sighs)
