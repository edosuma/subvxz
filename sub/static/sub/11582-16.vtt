00:01.502 --> 00:03.337
(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.371 --> 00:04.738
sexually based offenses

00:04.772 --> 00:07.075
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.377
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.410 --> 00:11.279
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.312 --> 00:12.713
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.746 --> 00:14.582
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.751
These are their stories.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.121
Did you see
that episode last night?

00:20.154 --> 00:21.289
Oh, my God,
the part where she's

00:21.322 --> 00:22.323
having sex
with the gardener,

00:22.356 --> 00:23.357
and the husband comes in?

00:23.391 --> 00:25.626
Oh, yeah, and then
lover boy jumps out the window.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.461
How great was that?

00:27.495 --> 00:29.163
We're out of water.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.432
Jerry, could you put
a new bottle on?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.733
Sure.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.368
Same thing happened
to my cousin.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.569
He wound up
on the balcony naked,

00:35.603 --> 00:37.638
and it was snowing.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.440
(woman)
Talk about frostbite.
That must have hurt.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.509
(woman #2)
Not as much as explaining it
to his wife.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.710
[women laughing]

00:42.743 --> 00:43.544
(Jerry)
What the hell?

00:47.515 --> 00:50.151
It's Elena.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.489
(man)
He really
did a number on her.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.225
Elena Brevet, 27.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.659
Owns Brevet Investments
with her husband.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.761
Raped and beaten,
then her throat was cut.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.296
Slashed her up
pretty good.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.166
17 deep incisions to her torso
and breasts, pre-mortem.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.867
Looks like
a sexual sadist.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.402
Time of death?
She's in full rigor.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.703
Heat was turned down
over the weekend.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.573
So I'd say no less
than 48 hours.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.108
(Fin)
That fits
the witness statements.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.376
Victim was last seen
Friday night.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.610
By who?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.379
By her secretary,
Patty Kerner.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.680
They got any
surveillance here?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.282
Cameras are downstairs
in the lobby.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.550
None on this floor.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.418
Munch is looking
at the tapes right now.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.254
Detectives Benson and Stabler
are gonna talk to you.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.455
Hi.
Hi.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.223
Can you take us
to Elena's office?

01:29.257 --> 01:30.858
It's right
down the hall.
Okay.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.394
What kind of investments
did your boss manage?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.728
A private hedge fund.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.530
700 million in assets.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.232
How's business?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.534
Last year, they posted
20% returns.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.436
That's 140 million profit.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.604
Pretty impressive.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.679
Is this the husband?

01:51.712 --> 01:52.746
(Patty)
Jason.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.183
Real Style section couple.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.417
Tell us about
Friday night.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.786
Um, Elena was supposed
to go to Miami

01:58.819 --> 02:00.454
for a client's party,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.423
but she had to finish
the quarterly reports.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.459
So Jason flew without her
on the 6:00.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.627
(Benson)
What time did you leave?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.462
Around 8:00.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.831
She was still working,
so I offered to stay.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.167
But she told me
to go home.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.802
Her husband
still in Miami?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.537
Let me check.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.511
He was booked
to come back last night.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.314
Oh, God.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.349
Jason doesn't know.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.185
We'll take care of that.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.454
There's no Missing Person report
on Elena Brevet.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.956
Strange that the husband
wouldn't file one.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.825
Maybe the marriage
isn't so perfect.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.560
Jason could have
pulled an O.J.,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.729
then flown to Miami
to set up his alibi.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.398
It's hard to believe the husband
would torture her like that.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.667
Rage makes people
do crazy things.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.303
Weekend paper's still here.
Maybe he stayed in Miami.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.671
[whistles]

02:50.704 --> 02:51.805
Door's open.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.244
(Benson)
Mr. Brevet, police.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.545
Luggage is here.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.447
Hello?
Anybody home?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.514
Liv.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.653
(Benson)
Mr. Brevet.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.762
Tortured like his wife.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.180
I field-tested
the blood around the chair.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.883
Same type as the victim.
Our perp leave
anything behind?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.285
No prints,
here or at the office.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.720
Killer knows forensics.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.488
Whole place was wiped clean
with bleach.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.689
He was just as careful
with the body.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.891
I haven't found
any trace evidence.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.960
Who was killed first,
Jason or Elena?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.296
Elena--Jason's been dead
only about 12 hours.

04:22.330 --> 04:26.334
Well, his plane got in
from Miami at 10:00 last night.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.636
Same cause of death?
Yes, his throat was cut.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.772
There's also trauma
to the back of his head.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.574
(Stabler)
So Jason comes home,
the perp blitzes him.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.443
Drags him to the chair,
tapes him up.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.312
Monogrammed key chain,
E.B.--Elena Brevet.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.314
Bastard took her keys
to let himself in.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.782
The guy waited all weekend
for Jason to come home?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.517
He tortured
the both of them.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.718
He had to be looking
for something.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.787
Detectives, I think
he found it upstairs.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.092
Built-in safe.
Not just any safe.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.662
The Yates 6000.
Totally pick-proof.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.963
He tortured Jason
for the combination

04:55.996 --> 04:57.465
and cleaned him out.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.499
I'm hoping
the gas chromatograph

04:58.532 --> 04:59.667
might tell us
what was in there.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.435
How do you test
for what's gone?

05:01.469 --> 05:02.903
New technology.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.705
Let's us analyze
trace odors,

05:04.738 --> 05:07.341
fragrances,
chemical vapors.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.577
Every chemical
or organic compound

05:09.610 --> 05:12.012
has a unique
olfactory profile.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.481
That's the signature.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.515
(Stabler)
Drugs?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.717
No, the smell of money.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.686
Well, specifically,
the dye in the ink.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.921
From the concentration
of the sample,

05:20.954 --> 05:23.323
had to be a few
cubic feet of cash.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.560
Even in small bills,

05:26.594 --> 05:28.762
that's gotta be at least
a million bucks.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.664
The Brevets
are financial managers.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.366
Now, why not
invest the cash?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.001
Money in a safe
doesn't earn interest.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.803
Maybe they were hiding it
from the IRS.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.971
Or their creditors.
I got the Brevets' financials.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.807
Both houses
mortgaged to the hilt.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.875
Credit card debt
in the six figures.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.877
Maybe living large,
they got in over their heads.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.846
Why not pay off their bills
with all that cash?

05:45.879 --> 05:47.581
'Cause they'd have
to explain where they got it.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.583
I had the forensic accountants
go over their books.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.386
Brevet Investments is nothing
but a high-end pyramid scheme.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.921
So all those huge profits
were phony?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.389
Yeah, they take the money
from one client,

05:55.423 --> 05:56.790
pay another's dividends,

05:56.824 --> 05:58.426
take the rest
for themselves.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.660
And one of their investors
got pissed off

05:59.693 --> 06:01.028
bad enough to kill 'em.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.029
Yeah, the kind
you don't wanna piss off--

06:02.062 --> 06:03.497
in Cali and Bogota.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.665
They're laundering
drug money?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.601
Yeah, and skimming it, too,
for one client in particular--

06:07.635 --> 06:09.970
a shell company out of Colombia
called Casa Vega Enterprises.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.406
Drug lord finds out
somebody's been ripping him off,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.074
he'd have to hit 'em quick
to set an example.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.043
Check with narcotics.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.645
See if Casa Vega
rings any bells.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.480
I got a guy over there
we can trust.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.519
(man)
I ran the name Casa Vega
through our intel files

06:25.553 --> 06:26.687
and came up empty.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.188
How'd the money
get into the account?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.691
Small deposits--
500 here, 1,000 bucks there.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.826
Classic black market
peso exchange.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.629
What's that?

06:35.663 --> 06:37.465
Say you're a Colombian
drug dealer,

06:37.498 --> 06:40.133
moving product...

06:40.167 --> 06:42.436
through the streets
of New York.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.804
Now, you're in Bogota,

06:43.837 --> 06:46.474
but your profits
are piling up in cash

06:46.507 --> 06:48.642
in the United States.

06:48.676 --> 06:49.610
And you can't move
all that cash

06:49.643 --> 06:51.211
back to Colombia
without attracting attention.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.946
You gotta launder it
to make it legit.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.082
So you hire a black market
money broker.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.117
Now, this broker
finds Colombian nationals

06:57.150 --> 07:00.120
with checking accounts
in the United States.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.755
Their broker gets
these solid citizens

07:01.789 --> 07:03.023
to write clean checks

07:03.056 --> 07:05.959
in exchange for
the dealer's dirty cash.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.028
The dealers can deposit
their checks any way they want.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.197
Like into the Casa Vega account
at Brevet Investments.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.065
Any idea on who's
making the deposits?

07:12.099 --> 07:14.067
Well, the forensic
accountant

07:14.101 --> 07:15.769
gave us this list.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.906
From cocaine
to dirty cash to clean checks,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.574
you launder it
through Wall Street,

07:20.608 --> 07:22.510
wire it back
to Bogota.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.478
Capitalism at its best.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.113
Now, this is a name I know.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.948
Elvira Castilla,
Jackson Heights.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.216
I collared her son
for selling weed

07:29.249 --> 07:31.552
out of the family bodega.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.853
So?
I invested some money.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.021
That's not a crime.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.523
Money laundering is.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.824
All I did
was write a check.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.259
So did Brevet Investments
pay you any dividends?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.495
No, but that's the way
the stock market is.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.030
You win some, you lose some.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.698
Now would you please leave?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.033
I gotta close up.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.768
Your son Pedro...

07:47.801 --> 07:50.070
he's up in Green Haven.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.905
Yeah.
You put him there.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.741
It's a seven-hour bus ride.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.843
Can't visit him too often.

07:55.876 --> 08:00.113
Sing Sing--that's
a much shorter trip.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.682
So you could
get him moved?

08:01.715 --> 08:02.816
You help us out,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.818
he gets transferred.

08:04.852 --> 08:08.288
There's this man.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.057
He's well-respected
in his community.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.659
Nice wife and kid.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.561
He came to me,
said he had a cousin.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.728
Wanted to invest some money.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.763
But he was illegal.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.197
So he asked you
to write a check

08:17.230 --> 08:18.666
to Brevet Investments?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.934
For $450.
He gave me back 500 cash.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.903
So a 50-buck
profit for you.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.305
How many times did you
do this favor for the cousin?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.876
I wrote 15,
maybe 20 checks.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.277
That's all I know.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.113
Give us a name.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.850
Guess no one's home.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.786
Senor Montoya!

08:38.819 --> 08:40.087
Policia.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.722
Mr. Montoya, police!

08:47.360 --> 08:48.829
Dead.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.764
But not for long.
The bodies are still warm.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.800
(Sandoval)
In here.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.877
Bastard kills a kid,

09:03.911 --> 09:05.579
doesn't even have
the balls to look at him.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.191
[boy groans]

09:20.260 --> 09:21.328
[groans]
Oh, my God!

09:21.361 --> 09:22.830
Call for a bus!

09:22.863 --> 09:24.331
Faster if we take him in.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.236
Esta bien, mi hijo.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.303
Esta Bien.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.610
Three years in narcotics,
I've seen a lot of bad stuff.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.812
But never
a dealer so cold

09:38.846 --> 09:41.348
that he'd shoot
a child in the head.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.116
I want in on this.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.254
Okay.
I'm calling Elliot.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.022
He should be
finishing up the crime scene.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.290
Detectives...

09:50.323 --> 09:52.192
He gonna make it, Doc?

09:52.225 --> 09:53.994
The kid was lucky.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.195
The bullet deflected
off the frontal bone.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.830
Just grazed the scalp.
Is he awake?

09:56.864 --> 09:58.131
You can see him.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.804
Hey, there.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.307
I'm Olivia.
What's your name?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.080
Maybe he doesn't
speak English.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.849
Why don't you
go ahead.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.117
Hola.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.354
Como te llamas?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.396
San Antonio.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.264
Es este tu santo?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.937
His name's Antonio,
after the saint.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.772
Antonio, me llamo Miguel.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.440
Soy policia.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.410
Mi mama y papa?

10:47.314 --> 10:50.918
Bueno, Antonio...

10:50.951 --> 10:52.920
tu mama y papa...

10:52.953 --> 10:55.889
Papa Dios
se los llevo al cielo.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.759
He says God
took them to heaven.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.728
Ask him why.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.230
Porque Papa Dios
hizo eso?

11:03.263 --> 11:06.033
Para salvarles el dolar.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.703
Porque le hizo dano
a mi mama y papa.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.072
To save them their pain.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.408
He was hurting them.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.044
Quien, Antonio?

11:17.077 --> 11:20.848
El Fantasma.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.215
[beeping]

11:22.249 --> 11:23.250
Um...

11:23.283 --> 11:25.853
he's saying a ghost...

11:25.886 --> 11:27.154
shot him.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.756
I think he's
still out of it.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.190
Okay.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.359
Stabler needs us
at the ballistics lab.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.426
Adios, Antonio.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.964
Ballistics results

11:36.997 --> 11:38.365
from the Montoya
homicides.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.366
Take a look.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.802
On the left, the bullet
taken from Mrs. Montoya.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.937
Three twists
and a left groove.

11:43.971 --> 11:47.074
On the right, the slug
taken from Mr. Montoya.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.241
The same gun.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.276
It makes sense
that they're identical.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.410
Now look at this.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.013
It's a perfect match.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.381
Same triple twist.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.448
Is that the bullet
from Antonio's bed?
No.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.184
From an unsolved homicide.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.351
What case?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.992
Murder of Alexandra Cabot.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.228
Who's that?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.402
Our old A.D.A.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.974
(Cragen)
Alexandra Cabot
was prosecuting a rapist

12:21.008 --> 12:23.343
who worked for Cesar Velez,
the narco baron.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.145
Velez ordered
the hit on Cabot

12:25.178 --> 12:27.314
and blew up D.E.A. agent
Tim Donovan,

12:27.347 --> 12:29.850
who was working
the case with us.

12:29.883 --> 12:30.851
The ballistics
match to the weapon

12:30.884 --> 12:32.385
used in the Cabot homicide

12:32.419 --> 12:35.923
is our link between Velez
and the Brevet-Montoya murders.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.125
And we believe that Elena
and Jason Brevet

12:38.158 --> 12:41.161
embezzled a couple of million
dollars from Cesar Velez.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.230
Sergio Montoya was working
as their middleman.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.998
When Velez found out
that he was getting ripped off,

12:45.032 --> 12:46.299
he ordered the hit.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.534
And the hit man was good.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.837
He left zero
forensic evidence

12:49.870 --> 12:52.239
at the Brevet
and Montoya homicides.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.007
Our best lead
is the security footage

12:54.041 --> 12:55.408
from Brevet Investments.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.544
We've excluded
over 200 employees,

12:57.577 --> 12:59.579
messengers,
and janitorial staff.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.449
We got about 75 subjects
left to identify.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.984
We got a lot of names.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.452
All the employees
at Brevet,

13:05.485 --> 13:07.888
everybody involved
in the money laundering scheme.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.157
Somebody has gotta
connect back to the cartel.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.192
D.E.A. can help us out
with that.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.526
Their HIDTA computers
are programmed

13:13.560 --> 13:14.594
to find links
between cases.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.129
Good.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.298
Get over to HIDTA.
Run every name we got.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.132
Yes, sir.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.970
Christine Torres, First Street,
Brooklyn, New York,

13:23.003 --> 13:24.838
sold checks to Montoya.

13:27.207 --> 13:31.144
Uh, owns a Laundromat.
Two kids, Calvin and Jose.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.445
Born in Puerto Rico.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.915
No Colombian connections.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.316
No links to any
of your other names.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.350
Next.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.988
That's all we got.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.490
This guy really is a ghost.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.992
What'd you say?

13:45.025 --> 13:47.995
Our kid witness said
a ghost killed his parents.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.963
Say it in Spanish--
El Fantasma?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.498
Why, does that
mean something to you?

13:51.531 --> 13:53.466
El Fantasma,
The Ghost.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.435
Contract killer.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.038
His name's come up in dozens
of assassinations in Colombia.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.439
What do you know about him?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.374
Real name's Liam Connors.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.977
Born in Belfast.
I.R.A. hit man.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.412
Did some time
in the Maze.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.614
Disappeared from Northern
Ireland about five years ago.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.116
Resurfaced in Bogota.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.218
Well, what's an Irish guy
doing in Colombia?

14:11.251 --> 14:13.253
Since the cease-fire
in Northern Ireland,

14:13.286 --> 14:15.322
a lot of out-of-work
I.R.A. guys

14:15.355 --> 14:17.925
are down there
training narco terrorist groups,

14:17.958 --> 14:20.293
helping them combat
U.S. anti-drug activity.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.963
So why is Connors
called The Ghost?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.932
Because he walks through walls
to get his targets.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.299
No one sees him coming,

14:26.333 --> 14:27.600
no one's left alive
to see him leave.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.636
Except our kid.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.204
I'm gonna
go back to the squad,

14:31.238 --> 14:33.106
get everyone
on this Connors.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.309
We gotta ask Antonio
if he can describe his ghost.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.210
Thank you.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.351
Hola, Tonio.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.086
Como estas?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.121
Muy bien, Senor Miguel.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.222
What's your name?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.126
Olivia.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.095
(Antonio)
I remember you.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.098
Good.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.467
Because we need your help,
Antonio.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.203
To find the person
who shot you.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.039
Okay.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.142
How did you know
that it was a ghost

15:09.176 --> 15:10.543
in your house last night?

15:10.577 --> 15:11.644
Mommy said so.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.013
She was screaming.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.082
That's why I woke up.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.017
Tell us
what Mommy said.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.987
El Fantasma.
Asesino.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.688
"Murderer."

15:21.721 --> 15:24.157
And then I heard the gun.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.093
What happened next?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.660
The Ghost
came into my room

15:27.694 --> 15:29.562
and shot me.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.531
When The Ghost
came into your room,

15:31.564 --> 15:34.267
were your eyes open
or were they closed?

15:34.301 --> 15:35.735
Closed.
I was scared.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.671
So I pretended
like I was asleep.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.141
I know that it was scary,
Antonio.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.543
But I think maybe
you took a little peek?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.616
Just for a second.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.085
Would you recognize The Ghost
if you saw him again?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.287
I don't want to.
He'll kill me.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.023
It's okay, Antonio.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.358
We're not gonna
let that happen.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.693
The Ghost can't hurt you.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.965
I know what he looks like.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.602
Elliot.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.271
How's Antonio?
He's better.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.606
A.C.S. is placing him
with a cousin in Staten Island.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.075
He's being discharged
this afternoon.
[cell phone ringing]

16:15.108 --> 16:16.409
Did he get a good enough
look at The Ghost

16:16.443 --> 16:17.710
to pick him
out of a lineup?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.279
I think so.
If we can find Connors.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.348
He's probably halfway back
to Bogota by now.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.715
Well, he's not getting on
any commercial flights.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.485
I checked with Interpol,
everyone's looking for this guy:

16:25.518 --> 16:27.087
F.B.I., C.I.A.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.455
He'll have
an escape route ready.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.522
Private plane, boat,

16:29.556 --> 16:30.657
maybe even
a border crossing by foot.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.259
Munch has got something.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.693
Rent-a-car parked
in a loading zone

16:33.726 --> 16:35.195
outside Brevet Investments

16:35.228 --> 16:36.729
got a parking ticket
late Friday night.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.431
Liam Connors
rented the car?

16:38.465 --> 16:41.234
No, it's a Bronx guy
by the name of Doyle Shanahan.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.570
Fund-raises for the I.R.A.
in bars around New York.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.804
Where can we find him?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.773
He works
in a warehouse downtown.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.279
(Irish man)
You can't arrest me
for rentin' a car.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.215
Okay, how about
conspiracy to commit murder?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.317
What are you talkin' about?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.119
Liam Connors.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.089
You rented a car for him.
He used it in a homicide.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.790
I don't know anything
about a homicide,

17:03.823 --> 17:05.592
and I don't know
Liam Connors.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.227
Sure you do.
He's I.R.A.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.162
You raise money
to buy them guns.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.131
I raise money
for Sinn Fein,

17:11.164 --> 17:12.665
a legitimate
political party

17:12.699 --> 17:14.267
fightin' for peace
in Ireland.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.635
And how does shooting
an eight-year-old in the head

17:15.668 --> 17:17.070
bring peace?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.671
Along with five others.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.739
Connors killed them all.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.208
Liam Connors

17:21.241 --> 17:22.709
doesn't work
for your people anymore.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.145
He's a contract killer
for the cartels.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.815
I didn't know.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.383
I swear.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.385
He just asked
for a favor for the cause.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.754
Favor was the rental car?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.589
Said he was having

17:36.623 --> 17:38.125
some secret meetings.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.160
Needed a car that couldn't
be traced to him.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.561
I never saw Liam.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.563
Just dropped it off,
picked it up yesterday.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.731
Where?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.467
At a fuel depot.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.736
Over in Gowanus,
on the canal.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.405
Ready?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.842
Hit it.
Huh!
[kicks door]

17:55.875 --> 17:58.278
Go, go, go, go!

17:58.311 --> 18:01.514
Police!

18:01.548 --> 18:03.216
(Benson)
Connors!

18:03.250 --> 18:03.850
(male officer)
Seal off the outside!

18:08.221 --> 18:10.490
Get the car!

18:24.771 --> 18:27.740
We're in pursuit of
homicide suspect Liam Connors

18:27.774 --> 18:29.409
headed south
along the canal.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.710
Headed south!

18:30.743 --> 18:33.146
[siren approaching]

18:40.887 --> 18:42.589
Unh! Ohh!

18:44.657 --> 18:45.692
You okay?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.360
Fine--go, go, go!

18:49.596 --> 18:52.265
[siren]

19:10.217 --> 19:11.384
(Benson)
I see him.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.685
He's headed
for the Carroll Street bridge.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.626
[tires squeal]

19:19.659 --> 19:21.728
Connors!

19:21.761 --> 19:23.496
Let's see the hands, Connors!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.634
Let me see your hands!
Now!

19:27.667 --> 19:30.169
Drink a mouthful of that,
you'll die in a week.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.311
I'm unarmed.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.388
Six men will be
standing in a row.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.589
And you're gonna tell me

19:49.622 --> 19:50.790
if you've seen
any of them before.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.225
He'll be mad.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.660
The Ghost will
come back and haunt me.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.229
Antonio, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.698
And, remember,
the men can't see you.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.234
You ready?

20:01.268 --> 20:02.235
Yes.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.804
Okay.
Come on.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.307
Why don't you just
jump up there?

20:07.340 --> 20:09.842
Good.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.812
Now...do you see anybody
that you recognize?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.021
Do you recognize
anyone?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.456
I see The Ghost.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.791
Number three.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.494
And where did you
see number three?

20:27.527 --> 20:30.930
He came into my room
and shot me.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.999
So, why'd you kill him?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.901
[door slams]

20:34.934 --> 20:36.636
[Irish accent]
Don't know what
you're talkin' about.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.738
We got a witness
who I.D.'d you.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.474
What witness
would that be?

20:42.809 --> 20:44.644
You'll find out in court.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.646
I didn't kill anyone.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.748
You raped and tortured
a woman for her house keys.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.882
I think if the price
were right,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.451
you'd murder your own mother.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.423
I'm glad
my mother's not alive

20:56.456 --> 20:59.792
to hear you slander
her only son like that.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.794
Now, Liam, look,
you've done time.

21:01.828 --> 21:02.862
You know how
the system works.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.597
You give us the guy
who hired you,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.766
your life expectancy
goes way up.

21:06.799 --> 21:07.834
Threatenin' me
with the death penalty?

21:07.867 --> 21:09.869
Now, that's original.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.371
But I suppose I'd be afraid

21:11.404 --> 21:12.639
if I'd actually
committed a crime.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.541
A crime?

21:14.574 --> 21:15.742
No, no, no, no, no.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.644
Five homicides.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.346
And then there's
the big one:

21:19.379 --> 21:21.581
the murder of an assistant
district attorney.

21:23.816 --> 21:27.654
This dead lawyer
was a friend of yours.

21:27.687 --> 21:28.888
You want revenge.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.958
I'll settle for justice.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.726
Somebody killed
my friend,

21:33.760 --> 21:36.429
I'd wanna hurt them...badly.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.898
Well, I'm a patient man.
I'll wait for your execution.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.767
Don't count
on that happening.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.036
It's a beautiful system
you Americans have.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.573
The defendant
has so many rights.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.876
Sure, I'll sit
in a jail for a year or two.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.479
And then a courtroom,
where you put on a show.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.013
But in the end,

21:54.046 --> 21:56.549
two little words
will set me free:

21:56.583 --> 21:57.817
reasonable doubt.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.820
I got one big word for you
that's gonna kill you:

22:00.853 --> 22:02.922
eyewitness.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.625
[whispering]
You're guilty.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.526
[whispering]
Am I?

22:09.796 --> 22:12.699
I can see that vein
pulsin' in your temple.

22:12.732 --> 22:13.933
Your jaw clenchin'.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.602
Look at that.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.936
You made a fist.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.974
You'd like nothin' better
than to hit me.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.880
How did your friend die?

22:27.914 --> 22:30.850
Was it quick...
or was it slow?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.118
You tell me.
You know, you were there.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.887
Really?
Yeah.

22:34.921 --> 22:38.491
Did anyone see me?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.564
Good night, detective.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.533
Sleep well.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.634
[door slams]

22:47.667 --> 22:49.736
Smug bastard.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.705
Except he's right--
nobody saw him shoot Alex.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.941
We've still got Antonio.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.509
We've got four murders

22:56.543 --> 22:57.977
resting on the shoulders
of an eight-year-old

22:58.010 --> 23:01.481
who said he saw a ghost.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.882
(woman)
Will the grand jury
take long?

23:02.915 --> 23:05.585
Hour, tops.
Then we'll take you home.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.086
Can I put
the siren on?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.988
On the way home,
if you do a good job.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.594
Gun!
[machine gun fire]

23:14.627 --> 23:15.828
Get down!

23:19.699 --> 23:20.567
Go, go, go!

23:25.071 --> 23:27.406
[tires screech]

23:34.213 --> 23:36.716
Antonio. Come on, honey.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.485
Mike has to get
to the hospital.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.819
No!

23:39.852 --> 23:41.053
I'll be okay, Tonio.
All right?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.722
I just need to get
a few stitches.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.756
I'll be back soon.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.957
Don't leave me.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.662
How long is Mike
gonna take?

23:49.696 --> 23:50.897
If there's no bullet fragments
in the wound,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.599
he should be good to go
in a couple of hours.

23:52.632 --> 23:53.866
All right if the kid
rides with you?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.868
Sure.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.004
I need you
to ride with them.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.772
See you guys
at the hospital.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.178
(Mike)
Antonio, you can't go back
to your cousins.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.215
But who's gonna
take care of me?

24:09.248 --> 24:11.250
We're gonna
figure that out.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.620
But why don't we
let Mike get dressed, okay?

24:13.653 --> 24:14.654
Come on.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.758
He has no other family
in this country?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.560
We'll have to set him up
in foster care.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.595
Captain, an attempt's
already been made on his life.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.632
And we didn't tell anyone
Antonio was our witness.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.800
You know, Captain,
Antonio could come home with me.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.069
My place is small,
but at least...

24:30.102 --> 24:31.771
Sorry, Mike.
The department would have a fit.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.640
Plus, the defense attorney
will raise hell.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.809
A Marine Corps buddy of mine
is stationed at Floyd Bennett.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.145
Maybe he can stay
in the barracks.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.248
No place safer than the middle
of a platoon of jarheads.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.950
Set it up.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.555
(Sandoval)
Captain, you think somebody
should stay with Antonio?

24:48.588 --> 24:50.089
I'll clear it
with your C.O.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.091
Thanks.
I'll tell him.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.093
Grand jury deadline
is at 3:00.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.862
Gotta get Antonio
down to court.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.931
If you're late, Judge Preston
will cut Connors loose.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.771
(Judge Preston)
You're late, Ms. Novak.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.305
It's 3:15.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.140
Sorry, your honor.
I was in the grand jury.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.909
They just indicted the defendant
on all counts.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.278
15 minutes too late.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.714
There was an attempt
on the eyewitness' life.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.849
I think witness tampering
is grounds for an extension.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.751
My client's been on Rikers.
He didn't shoot anyone.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.320
And I'm betting you don't have
any proof of his involvement.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.022
So it's just a coincidence
that Antonio Montoya

25:23.055 --> 25:25.692
was shot at on his way to
testify against the defendant?

25:25.725 --> 25:26.993
You can call it
whatever you like.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.294
You still can't
connect Mr. Connors

25:28.327 --> 25:30.096
to the shooting
of your witness.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.331
(Judge Preston)
I'm sorry, Ms. Novak.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.266
I can't grant an extension
without proof

25:34.300 --> 25:35.201
of the defendant's complicity
in the shooting.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.804
The People have failed
to meet the deadline.

25:37.837 --> 25:41.007
I'm ordering the defendant
released until the trial.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.341
Your honor, Connors
is a flight risk.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.711
If you let him go,
we will never get him back.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.178
I give you my word
my client will make

25:46.212 --> 25:47.714
all of his court
appearances.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.882
I would like something
stronger than his word.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.955
I'm sorry.
You're free to go, Mr. Connors.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.757
[gavel strikes]

26:01.794 --> 26:03.963
Arrest him.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.735
Your honor,
my detectives are here

26:08.768 --> 26:09.869
to re-arrest
the defendant.

26:09.902 --> 26:13.039
On what charges?

26:13.072 --> 26:16.375
The murder of Assistant District
Attorney Alexandra Cabot.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.210
Your honor,
this is a blatant attempt

26:18.244 --> 26:20.379
to unlawfully
detain my client.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.380
(Judge Preston)
Save it, counselor.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.283
Alex Cabot
was a friend of mine.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.619
I'll see you both
at arraignments.

26:26.653 --> 26:27.920
[gavel strikes]

26:33.225 --> 26:35.628
You can't prove
I killed her.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.363
And the dead can't talk.

26:37.396 --> 26:40.032
William Connors,
you're under arrest for murder.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.701
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.770
If you give up that right,
anything you say...

26:43.803 --> 26:44.937
[door opens]

26:44.971 --> 26:47.840
What the hell
are you people doing?

26:47.874 --> 26:49.275
Agent Hammond.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.043
Most people knock first.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.645
You should have called me

26:52.679 --> 26:53.946
before your detectives
arrested Liam Connors

26:53.980 --> 26:55.815
for the murder
of Alex Cabot.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.750
Connors blew up
one of your agents.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.252
I didn't expect flowers,
but I thought you'd be pleased.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.021
If Connors goes to trial,
I'm called to testify.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.089
What am I supposed to do?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.223
Do your job.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.392
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.861
I just came to tell you
that you're on your own.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.664
I'm not gonna ruin my career
by committing perjury.

27:11.698 --> 27:14.934
Do we understand each other,
Captain?

27:14.967 --> 27:17.103
She's alive.

27:20.707 --> 27:21.774
You son of a bitch.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.409
You stashed Alex
in Witness Protection.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.013
You didn't know.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.827
How the hell
did you think

27:40.860 --> 27:42.194
you were gonna
get away with this?
Captain--

27:42.228 --> 27:45.131
Forget your not mentioning
that Alex Cabot's alive.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.298
Captain, we couldn't.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.800
You signed an affidavit

27:47.834 --> 27:49.401
charging Liam Connors
with her murder.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.203
Staying dead
is her only protection.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.906
You perjured yourselves!
It's a Class E felony!

27:53.940 --> 27:56.042
We didn't know Novak was gonna
force us to arrest him.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.810
Now, the only way to refuse

27:57.844 --> 28:00.079
would be to tell her
in open court Cabot's alive.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.313
I know
why you did it.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.481
But you can't
send somebody away

28:02.514 --> 28:04.083
for a crime
they didn't commit.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.151
Connors kills
for a living.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.019
We're in a position
to stop him.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.220
Now, that's justice.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.355
So the ends
justify the means.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.424
You gonna shed tears
over him?

28:12.458 --> 28:13.760
We did what we had to do.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.933
What you did was put your jobs
and pensions on the line.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.402
You jeopardized
every pending case you have

28:23.435 --> 28:24.904
and every conviction
you've ever gotten.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.306
That's what you did.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.108
Now, do you think Alex Cabot

28:29.141 --> 28:31.377
would want you to do that
in her name?

28:34.180 --> 28:36.415
So what are you
gonna do?

28:39.085 --> 28:40.820
I wish the hell I knew.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.334
[car doors slamming]

29:03.810 --> 29:05.377
What happened?

29:10.249 --> 29:13.786
So this
is what he looks like.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.789
Every time a stranger
glanced at me,

29:16.823 --> 29:19.859
I thought,
"Has he found me?

29:19.892 --> 29:22.829
Is he going to kill me?"

29:22.862 --> 29:25.231
And now I know.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.801
[sighs]

29:28.835 --> 29:30.903
I would like
nothing more

29:30.937 --> 29:34.406
than to see Liam Connors
pay for what he did to me.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.476
But it goes against every
principal I had as a lawyer

29:37.509 --> 29:40.279
to try a man for a crime
he didn't commit.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.381
You understand
I didn't have a choice?

29:42.414 --> 29:44.016
I know you can't
commit perjury.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.517
You're going to have
to tell the court

29:45.551 --> 29:46.385
that I'm still alive.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.320
I'm only sorry

29:48.354 --> 29:50.456
the bastard won't have to answer
for what he did to you.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.859
Oh, he will.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.961
I want him charged
with my attempted murder.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.462
No, you'd have to go back
to testify.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.931
That's stepping
right into the crosshairs.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.901
For years, I convinced victims
to face their attackers.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.602
Now it's time for me
to step up.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.437
Your testimony
won't help the case.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.907
You can't I.D. Connors
as your shooter.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.876
If I don't go back,
the defense will issue

30:09.909 --> 30:10.910
a missing witness charge.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.478
And then you
will lose your case.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.547
We've still got Connors
on four counts of murder.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.417
Because an eight-year-old boy
has the guts to testify.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.551
After being shot twice.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.020
Alex...

30:21.053 --> 30:22.989
If you go back,

30:23.022 --> 30:24.256
they will
try and kill you again.

30:28.260 --> 30:32.031
I have lost my home...

30:32.064 --> 30:33.565
my job...

30:33.599 --> 30:36.168
my friends...

30:36.202 --> 30:38.104
My mother died,

30:38.137 --> 30:41.340
and I couldn't
go to the funeral.

30:41.373 --> 30:45.144
Liam Connors is not going
to take my conscience too.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.516
[door opens]

30:54.120 --> 30:56.155
We work together.
You should have trusted me.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.925
We made a promise.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.894
You hung me out to dry
in court.

31:01.928 --> 31:02.594
We gonna need lawyers?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.430
I hope not.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.936
Alex.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.005
You didn't
have to come back.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.474
I know, but who else is gonna
get you out of trouble?

31:17.176 --> 31:18.410
Before everyone
gets reacquainted,

31:18.444 --> 31:21.948
they're waiting for us
in court.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.515
(Judge Preston)
Have the People secured
a new indictment

31:23.549 --> 31:25.217
of the defendant?

31:25.251 --> 31:26.352
We have, your honor.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.220
Under the indictment
72404,

31:28.254 --> 31:30.422
the defendant is hereby charged
with attempted murder one.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.058
Another indictment?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.192
This is ludicrous,
your honor.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.627
My client was arrested
for Murder One.

31:35.661 --> 31:36.963
What happened to that charge?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.397
The People withdrew it.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.166
Obviously
for lack of evidence.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.269
Ms. Novak, you can't keep
throwing bogus charges

31:43.302 --> 31:45.137
at my client,
just to keep him in jail.

31:45.171 --> 31:48.975
Who is your complainant
in the attempted murder case?

31:49.008 --> 31:51.477
A.D.A. Alexandra Cabot.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.046
[door opens]

32:08.360 --> 32:11.230
(defense)
Your honor, I want Detectives
Stabler and Benson arrested.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.364
(Judge Preston)
On what charge?

32:12.398 --> 32:14.066
Perjury.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.168
They filed
a false instrument,

32:16.202 --> 32:18.370
charging my client
with Ms. Cabot's murder.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.438
(Novak)
The detectives had no choice.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.639
Revealing the truth

32:20.672 --> 32:23.209
would have endangered
Ms. Cabot's life.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.110
My client
was unlawfully detained.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.445
I also want them
charged with false arrest.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.214
Your honor, if we had
arrested Mr. Connors

32:28.247 --> 32:29.648
for attempted murder,

32:29.681 --> 32:31.683
he would have been incarcerated
for the same amount of time.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.019
So there was
no loss of liberty.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.486
I agree.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.089
I find no underlying violation
of your client's rights.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.491
Detectives Benson and Stabler
will not be charged.

32:39.525 --> 32:43.195
But see that they play
by the book from here on out.

32:43.229 --> 32:46.198
The defendant shall remain
on remand.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.667
Ten minute recess.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.701
[gavel strikes]

32:58.610 --> 33:00.112
Something happen
to Antonio?

33:00.146 --> 33:03.282
No, he's okay,
but we've got a problem.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.750
I'm really scared.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.086
I don't wanna see The Ghost.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.088
He gives me bad dreams.

33:09.121 --> 33:12.558
He says he's
going to kill me.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.793
He had a nightmare
last night.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.029
The Ghost had a gun
in the courtroom.

33:17.063 --> 33:20.432
Well, that sounds like
a really scary dream.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.201
But, you know what,
Antonio?

33:22.234 --> 33:24.503
The Ghost doesn't
have a gun anymore.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.571
'Cause the police

33:25.604 --> 33:26.772
took it away from him.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.441
I know.
Mike told me.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.610
But I still don't want
to go to court.

33:33.212 --> 33:37.416
I got shot,
just like you.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.185
By The Ghost?

33:39.218 --> 33:41.153
Yes.

33:41.187 --> 33:44.190
And I have
to go to court too.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.491
Are you scared?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.526
A little.

33:47.559 --> 33:50.629
I get scared that he might
try and hurt me again.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.332
But then I remember that I
have friends to protect me,

33:53.365 --> 33:54.500
just like you do.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.836
And it makes me
feel safe.

33:57.869 --> 34:01.440
I wish my mom was here.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.676
I'll keep working with him.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.645
Come on, Tonio.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.218
Bye.

34:19.525 --> 34:22.461
We should keep
preparing my testimony.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.296
You know, we've gone over
all my questions.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.497
I think you're ready.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.199
Are you?

34:29.701 --> 34:32.171
Ohh.
Casey, I'm sorry.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.773
That was...out of line.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.477
It's gotta be hard to be
on that side of the desk.

34:41.613 --> 34:45.417
If Antonio doesn't testify,
we're screwed.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.386
I know.

34:50.222 --> 34:53.159
Oh! Who's your daddy?

34:54.493 --> 34:56.728
Wanna double it up?

34:56.762 --> 34:59.198
Uh, you win.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.699
Next game,
your ass is mine.

35:02.168 --> 35:05.504
You're gonna do great
tomorrow.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.772
When I was a prosecutor,

35:06.805 --> 35:10.209
I never went to court
without a plan.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.511
Well...

35:12.544 --> 35:14.280
You've never been the victim.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.648
I should be
trying the bastard

35:16.682 --> 35:18.484
who shot that little boy.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.719
You're gonna be back.

35:20.752 --> 35:21.753
[knock on door]

35:24.723 --> 35:27.125
Hey, it's Liv.
Open up.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.895
Time to go home.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.430
Hey.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.565
You get
your beauty sleep.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.334
I'll be back 8:00 sharp
tomorrow morning

35:35.367 --> 35:36.602
to bring you to court.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.737
Good night.

35:38.770 --> 35:39.905
He beat you again?

35:39.938 --> 35:42.241
Oh, like a rug.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.544
You want to keep playing?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.213
Nah.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.951
I wish
these windows opened.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.222
I-I want
to smell the city.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.523
You mean the, uh,
rotting garbage

35:57.556 --> 36:00.459
and the diesel exhaust.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.296
Wisconsin
is so quiet at night.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.764
Sometimes,
when I get homesick,

36:05.797 --> 36:07.533
I hum the Mister Softee song.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.405
Well...

36:13.439 --> 36:15.341
You making any friends?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.713
There's a claims adjuster

36:21.747 --> 36:25.551
at the insurance agency
where I work.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.919
And we've been
seeing each other.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.355
Good.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.657
He's a good man.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.426
He thinks
I'm from Tulsa.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.496
And when we're
in bed together at night,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.331
he whispers my name.

36:40.832 --> 36:43.469
Emily.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.610
It's hard to be
someone that you're not.

36:51.643 --> 36:55.381
I can't stop thinking
like a prosecutor.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.586
Connors is going to sit
in that courtroom tomorrow,

37:00.619 --> 37:03.655
looking like a choir boy.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.591
He is going
to charm the jury

37:05.624 --> 37:06.925
with his Irish brogue,

37:06.958 --> 37:09.495
and--and
I have to make them

37:09.528 --> 37:11.330
see who he really is.

37:11.363 --> 37:14.733
But...I don't even
know what makes him tick.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.234
Alex...

37:21.373 --> 37:22.841
You didn't see this file.

37:35.854 --> 37:38.357
(Novak)
Finally, Ms. Cabot,

37:38.390 --> 37:39.691
would you describe
for the jury

37:39.725 --> 37:41.927
what happened
after you were shot?

37:41.960 --> 37:44.029
I woke up
in the hospital.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.665
The marshals were there.

37:46.698 --> 37:50.302
They told me
that I was dead, officially,

37:50.336 --> 37:52.070
and that the only way
they could keep me alive

37:52.103 --> 37:54.406
was in Witness Protection.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.609
Thank you.

37:57.643 --> 37:59.678
Your witness.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.713
That sounds like
quite an ordeal.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.716
I think we're all very moved
by your experience.

38:04.750 --> 38:05.917
Do you have a question?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.453
Only one.

38:07.486 --> 38:10.389
Did you see my client
shoot you?

38:10.422 --> 38:12.023
I saw his gun
aimed at my heart.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.058
Please, Ms. Cabot.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.860
Just answer the question.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.828
On the night
that you were shot,

38:16.862 --> 38:19.465
did you see Liam Connors
anywhere in the vicinity?

38:19.498 --> 38:22.334
No, but he's a coward.
He likes to run away.

38:22.368 --> 38:24.470
Did you leave a family
behind in Ireland, Mr. Connors?

38:24.503 --> 38:26.372
Your honor--

38:26.405 --> 38:27.473
Ms. Cabot, please.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.641
You have
absolutely no idea

38:29.675 --> 38:31.109
who shot you, do you?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.644
Oh, I have an idea.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.112
It's the kind of man
that likes to rape a woman

38:34.145 --> 38:35.447
to make her talk.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.683
Let me rephrase
the question.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.452
Did you see
Liam Connors shoot you?

38:40.486 --> 38:42.954
No.
But I know it was him.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.591
Objection, your honor.
It takes a lot of balls

38:45.624 --> 38:47.559
to shoot an unarmed woman
and a sleeping child!

38:47.593 --> 38:49.595
Objection!
Too bad your aim
wasn't a little better!

38:49.628 --> 38:51.430
You think you're safe?
They know where you are!

38:51.463 --> 38:52.631
You should have
stayed dead!

38:52.664 --> 38:54.099
[gavel striking]
Enough!

38:54.132 --> 38:55.601
We're in recess

38:55.634 --> 38:56.868
until Mr. Kressler
can control his client.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.571
You may step down,
Ms. Cabot.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.896
Hi, Alex.

39:24.930 --> 39:28.099
Antonio, I am so glad that
you could come to the court.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.635
I'm proud of him too.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.504
But you still
have a decision to make.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.041
Antonio...

39:36.074 --> 39:37.609
what do you want to do?

39:37.643 --> 39:39.778
I don't know.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.682
I wanna tell the judge
what he did to my parents.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.050
But I'm still kinda scared.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.619
I understand.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.188
I just had my turn in court.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.957
Did you see The Ghost?

39:51.990 --> 39:54.493
Yes.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.728
Were you scared?

39:56.762 --> 39:59.431
Yes.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.901
But now that it's over,
I feel much better.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.170
Antonio Montoya.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.815
[sighs]

40:18.817 --> 40:20.852
I wanna do it.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.989
Okay.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.695
Hmm.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.502
[scoffs]

41:14.205 --> 41:15.874
On the first count
of the indictment,

41:15.907 --> 41:17.242
the attempted
second-degree murder

41:17.275 --> 41:18.610
of Antonio Montoya,

41:18.644 --> 41:19.645
what is your verdict?

41:19.678 --> 41:21.580
Guilty.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.649
On count two,
the attempted

41:23.682 --> 41:24.916
murder
in the first degree

41:24.950 --> 41:26.985
of Alexandra Cabot,

41:27.018 --> 41:28.119
what is your verdict?

41:28.153 --> 41:29.588
(foreman)
Guilty.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.890
On count three,
murder in the second degree

41:31.923 --> 41:34.125
of Elena Brevet,
what is your verdict?

41:34.159 --> 41:36.728
Guilty.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.897
Count four,
murder in the second degree

41:38.930 --> 41:39.898
of Jason Brevet,

41:39.931 --> 41:40.966
what is your verdict?

41:40.999 --> 41:43.869
Guilty.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.303
(Novak)
Guilty on all counts.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.806
I never doubted
it would be anything else.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.307
Let's get
this party started.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.543
Ooh, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.679
(Stabler)
Alex knew just how
to push Connors' buttons.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.146
She's a great prosecutor.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.616
And you gave her
the ammunition.

41:57.649 --> 41:58.950
(Novak)
Don't let me
drink too much.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.786
Penalty phase starts
first thing in the morning.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.287
Slam dunk.
Live a little tonight.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.122
Is that her?
Is that her?

42:04.155 --> 42:05.290
Shh, shh, shh.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.663
Where's Alex?

42:11.697 --> 42:15.300
Marshals are moving her
and Antonio to new identities.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.102
She asked me
to say good-bye.

42:54.139 --> 42:55.907
( wolf howling )
