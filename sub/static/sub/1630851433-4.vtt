00:36.953 --> 00:38.163
Here you are, madam.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.457
Ta-da!

00:42.709 --> 00:43.543
Syrup.

00:44.669 --> 00:45.754
Uh...

00:46.546 --> 00:48.965
-I have something even better than syrup.
-What?

00:49.507 --> 00:50.592
Pretend syrup.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.642
-Here you go.
-Does Schmariel want some pretend syrup?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.853
Here you go, Schmariel.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.231
She's had enough? I'll have
to cut you off. That's a lot of syrup.

01:05.732 --> 01:09.110
Which jammies you wanna bring to Daddy's?
Rainbows?

01:09.694 --> 01:11.863
-Or the unicorns?
-Rainbows.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.241
Done. Easy. Such a good choice.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.494
Excited about
spending Thanksgiving at Daddy's?

01:17.577 --> 01:21.081
-What's that?
-Well, it's a very complicated day,

01:21.164 --> 01:24.334
and I'll tell you all about it
when you get older.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.337
But right now, just know
you're going to your daddy's,

01:27.420 --> 01:30.340
and you're gonna eat a whole lot of food

01:30.423 --> 01:33.093
and think about
all the things that you're thankful for.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.512
And I'm not gonna be there,
and I'll miss you a lot.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.639
But you'll have a really good time.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.058
Mommy's got a lot of houses to clean.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.853
A lot of people want their houses cleaned
before Thanksgiving.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.320
-How are we doing on those pancakes?
-Oh!

01:55.323 --> 01:58.326
-Look at that one I ate.
-Hey.

01:58.993 --> 02:03.123
Excuse me. Boop, boop, boop.
You need to eat some pancakes.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.126
Time to eat some pancakes, young lady.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.712
If you get down
those last two bites of pancake,

02:09.796 --> 02:13.675
you and me
are gonna have a very special surprise.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.386
You promise?
All right, let's see it happen.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.097
Let's do it.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.268
Score!

02:23.685 --> 02:24.519
Whoo!

02:31.818 --> 02:35.280
One second. We gotta get our mail, okay?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.132
-Guess what I got.
-What?

02:55.508 --> 02:59.971
Food. Today's gonna be a very good day.
I can feel it.

03:01.055 --> 03:01.973
There she is.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.559
It's a clunker, but it's safe.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.728
My grandpa drove this thing
for 30-some years.

03:06.811 --> 03:10.064
If anybody hits this thing,
they're gonna be in trouble.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.442
Are you sure this isn't putting you out?

03:12.525 --> 03:16.696
No, I mean, it just sits in my garage.
You're kind of doing me a favor.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.698
It needs to get driven
or the battery dies.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.325
Okay. Thank you.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.828
Hey, what do you think
of our big surprise?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.039
-Blue.
-You think it's blue?

03:26.581 --> 03:30.293
We've been taking the bus,
and this will be a game-changer.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.795
I'm so excited. I'm gonna kiss your car.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.925
-Yeah. You can. I just washed it.
-Thanks again for the car seat.

03:37.425 --> 03:41.346
Oh, yeah. Brady grew out of that one.
I figured it would fit Maddy.

03:43.848 --> 03:44.766
What?

03:44.849 --> 03:49.729
-Uh, it's just until I can save up.
-Keep it as long as you need.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.149
Hey, Maddy,
you got any big turkey-day plans?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.611
-Daddy's.
-Oh, Daddy's. That's great.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.447
Are you both going
to her dad's place, or...?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.741
No, just Maddy.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.329
Oh. Okay, well, hey, if you need
somewhere to go for Thanksgiving...

04:06.412 --> 04:07.455
Thanks.

04:07.538 --> 04:11.709
My parents do just an incredible spread,
and you're welcome if...

04:11.793 --> 04:13.711
Thank you, I'm working, but that's sweet.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.674
-You're working Thanksgiving?
-Yeah.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.927
I work whenever I can,
when I don't have her.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.054
Cool.

04:24.430 --> 04:29.060
Hey, uh, maybe some time you could
clunk that thing on down to my place.

04:30.270 --> 04:36.192
Um, the car,
because I called it a clunker before.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.193
Um...

04:37.902 --> 04:42.657
I guess I was trying to ask you out.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.077
Um...

04:48.288 --> 04:49.956
-Uh...
-But, um...

04:50.039 --> 04:56.629
No, I... Gosh, I don't wanna, you know,
take the car if there's strings attached.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.923
No, yeah, that's not what I meant.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.342
My life's not set up for dating right now.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.845
Your life's not set up for dating,
I get that.

05:03.928 --> 05:09.517
-I really appreciate this so much.
-Yes, of course. You need the keys.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.478
So...

05:14.397 --> 05:17.066
-Thank you, Nate.
-Yes, no problem.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.735
I mean it, yeah.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.113
-Anytime.
-Okay.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.757
How are those blueberries?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.884
-Good.
-Yeah?

05:45.678 --> 05:46.721
Hi there.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.306
Paper or plastic?

05:48.389 --> 05:49.599
Paper, please.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.818
And I'm gonna be using one of these today.

06:02.445 --> 06:06.366
Cleanup on
aisle poor. Cleanup on aisle poor.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.508
Uh, I'm actually
gonna hold off on these guys.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.436
67.45, please.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.523
Swipe it, like a card.
Use the pin from the form.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.368
Thanks.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.162
-Paper or plastic?
-Just plastic.

06:53.246 --> 06:58.584
What do you say we do something super,
duper, duper fun, in our brand-new car?

07:13.891 --> 07:14.725
Go!

07:14.809 --> 07:16.102
I think you cheated!

07:54.724 --> 07:57.226
Okay, so you're gonna
go to your daddy's for two days,

07:57.310 --> 08:02.273
you're gonna be super, duper, duper good,
and then Mommy's gonna come pick you up.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.693
Does that sound all right?
You're gonna have your Thanksgiving there?

08:05.776 --> 08:07.069
Uh-huh?

08:07.153 --> 08:08.404
-Uh-huh?
-Hey.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.824
There she is, there's my girl. Hi, baby.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.534
Aye!

08:16.037 --> 08:17.622
Whoa!

08:17.705 --> 08:19.999
Thank you for coming over here.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.918
Yeah, did you pack a snack this time?

08:22.919 --> 08:26.422
We're supposed to split costs, Sean.
You can buy snacks too.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.051
Right. Okay.
You ready to have some fun, Maddy?

08:30.134 --> 08:33.387
-And she hasn't had her nap yet.
-Okay. Great.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.932
Mommy gave you to me crabby.

08:36.682 --> 08:40.102
-She can just nap in your car.
-Yeah, it's not a real nap.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.479
What's up with you?

08:43.189 --> 08:45.900
I'm tired. I worked late.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.863
Had to get up early to get a ferry
to accommodate your schedule.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.031
You're hungover.

08:52.114 --> 08:55.284
No, I'm not.
Hey, I told you, I'm not drinking.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.412
-Still?
-Yes. Still.

09:00.498 --> 09:04.210
I'm actually about to get my white chip.
It feels good.

09:04.293 --> 09:08.756
I'm kind of digging sobriety. You know?
Not feeling like shit all the time.

09:10.841 --> 09:14.595
-I can see it on your face. You look good.
-Yeah, I know I do.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.225
So Maddy will be at your place tomorrow?

09:19.308 --> 09:22.436
Yep. What are you doing?
Something with your mom?

09:23.771 --> 09:27.608
She's AWOL.
You know how she is with the holidays.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.237
But I'm okay. Stop feeling sorry for me.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.072
-I'm not.
-Okay.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.242
I love you.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.291
You have a good time, all right?

09:44.333 --> 09:48.963
Hey, you can come tomorrow.
If you want. It'll be chill.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.888
Uh, no, thank you, I'm good.
You guys have fun.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.807
Can't say we didn't try, right, Mad?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.560
All right. Say bye to Mommy.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.480
I love you so much. Bye, cutie!

10:08.399 --> 10:09.984
Sack of potatoes.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.820
Bye! Bye, Mom!

10:13.613 --> 10:14.530
Bye, Mom!

10:25.124 --> 10:26.917
So I decided not to get the car washed.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.963
One good thing about living out here
with all the rain, free car washes.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.300
You know what else is free?
Pain and heartache. Pain and suffering.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.469
That's what my mother used to say.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.099
Never mind these boxes,
just clean around them.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.560
We'll take them to the homeless shelter.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.520
They do a food drive every Thanksgiving,

10:46.604 --> 10:49.231
so I go through my pantry,
find what's almost expired.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.234
Well, I'm off to Whole Foods!
Happy Thanksgiving!

10:52.318 --> 10:53.569
Happy Thanksgiving!

12:18.404 --> 12:22.158
But now you're up from the dream

12:42.845 --> 12:45.014
Those are a pointless vegetable.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.102
Just make sure
to have a vegan option for Daniel.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.690
Sarah, Sarah, I have to let you go.
Okay? Drive safe.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.070
Your sister is driving me crazy.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.406
What time should I pick up Bennett
from SeaTac?

13:02.490 --> 13:07.495
Honey, all I know
is that I am meeting you at your mom's.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.122
Hi.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.709
Oh, honey, this is Alex. The maid.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.214
-Is that what I'm supposed to call you?
-Oh, yeah, maid's fine.

13:18.714 --> 13:22.259
-Hi, I'm James, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.386
-How's business?
-Busy.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.431
Yeah? Regina,
you know we've got seven pies, right?

13:27.515 --> 13:30.559
Do we really need to bring seven pies?
You don't even eat pie.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.230
They're not for eating.
They are for looking at.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.315
We can put them out
after the announcement.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.442
It'll be like a celebratory thing.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.780
Can you put them
in the car for me, please? Thank you.

13:47.034 --> 13:51.247
Sorry, they told me to come at 3.
I didn't realize you would still be here.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.958
No, yeah, we are running late.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.379
I really appreciate you having me back.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.216
After the Mr. Darcy thing.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.927
I don't like
the way the other girls clean, so...

14:08.722 --> 14:10.349
Okay. We're off.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.434
Um...

14:12.518 --> 14:14.645
Can I get your Wi-Fi password?

14:14.728 --> 14:19.775
I don't have any service here, and I have
to be reachable in case my daughter...

14:20.943 --> 14:22.945
Your daughter. Right.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.825
So you got her back, then?

14:28.325 --> 14:31.453
Partial custody, yeah.
She's with her dad right now.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.456
Thanks.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.253
-Is this a five or an S?
-It is an S.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.716
I'm sorry to leave such a mess,
but I've been baking since dawn.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.469
But the house is still on the market,
so do a thorough job. Okay?

14:47.553 --> 14:48.387
Of course.

14:50.764 --> 14:55.227
Actually, I noticed last time
that the upstairs guest bathroom,

14:55.311 --> 14:59.273
the grout could use a deep clean.
But the bleach smell can be a lot.

14:59.356 --> 15:03.527
I was thinking I could come in tomorrow
and take care of it.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.362
On Thanksgiving day?

15:05.446 --> 15:08.824
Yeah, I don't have a lot going on,
and I could use the work.

15:09.325 --> 15:13.662
Well, does that cost extra?
I imagine you have a holiday rate?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.664
No, I won't charge you extra.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.210
That's fine, then.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.341
Now, Mr. Darcy, yes, yes, yes.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.635
Taking him with me.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.136
Happy Thanksgiving to you too, Mr. Darcy.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.544
Once you pour
the white vinegar on the grout line

16:43.627 --> 16:45.170
and let that soak in for a little bit,

16:45.254 --> 16:47.840
the baking soda
will add some grit to the whole thing,

16:47.923 --> 16:49.550
give it a little bit of texture.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.301
See, the grit's coming right out.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.457
Like my beard?

18:03.957 --> 18:05.918
It's my niece. You wanna fuck?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.796
This is my snake.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.593
Made dinner for two. Ate both.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.054
Sober, single dad.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.747
Please leave a message after the tone.

18:44.623 --> 18:49.711
Hey, Mom. Uh... Just giving you a call
because it's Thanksgiving.

18:51.171 --> 18:54.299
So, yeah, I'll talk to you later.
All right, love you, bye.

18:54.800 --> 18:59.012
What? That's so cool!
What was your favorite part of the parade?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.013
Santa.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.723
You saw Santa?

19:01.807 --> 19:04.059
Oh, my goodness, sweetie pie!

19:04.143 --> 19:05.727
Hey, let me talk to Mommy.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.858
-Hey, we gotta go.
-No, I just got on the phone.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.486
Yeah, I know,
but say, "Happy Thanksgiving, Mommy."

19:15.821 --> 19:18.407
Happy Thanksgiving, Mommy.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.534
I love you, Maddy. I love you so--

19:40.387 --> 19:43.390
Happy Thanksgiving.
You're gonna get stuffed.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.978
I'm thankful for that ass.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.479
Wanna suck on my beard?

22:54.581 --> 22:56.249
What's happenin', turkey?

23:00.337 --> 23:02.923
Let's just, yeah, forget I ever said that.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.884
How's your Indigenous People's Day going?

23:06.635 --> 23:09.554
Kinda just feels like any other day.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.472
You?

23:10.889 --> 23:13.392
Ah, well, my family is driving me insane.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.018
I'm only home for 48 hours,

23:15.102 --> 23:17.979
and I'm already considering
changing my flight to "now."

23:18.063 --> 23:19.189
How about you?

23:19.981 --> 23:20.982
Same.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.613
Your profile says that you go to NYU

23:27.447 --> 23:29.157
and that you're half French.

23:33.787 --> 23:37.749
And I go to NYU.
In grad school. For, uh, film.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.296
I'm a junior
at Montana College of Fine Arts.

23:44.214 --> 23:47.426
And I'm studying creative writing.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.010
A writer.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.471
Uh-oh.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.850
Do you want to play a game?

23:56.810 --> 23:59.146
I'll literally play any game with you.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.232
Or on you.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.611
Or next to you,
or, really, whatever you want.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.451
Wanna play "meet in person"?

24:15.036 --> 24:16.329
Where should we meet?

24:17.414 --> 24:18.707
We can meet here...

24:21.334 --> 24:22.377
At my house.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.410
-Hey.
-Hi.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.620
What's up?

24:56.703 --> 24:58.538
-Do you want--
-I brought you a gourd.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.752
I don't know if it's edible,
but it's festive, so...

25:05.545 --> 25:06.463
Thanks.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.008
Come in.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.013
Is this your parents' place?

25:15.972 --> 25:19.935
Yeah. Yeah. It's my dad and my stepmom's.

25:20.602 --> 25:24.231
It's a little over the top, I know.
They're in Bermuda right now.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.401
Hopefully not the triangle.

25:30.570 --> 25:34.324
No, yeah, I think, uh, the vacation part.

25:36.535 --> 25:42.082
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm really nervous,
like, my fingernails are sweating.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.502
You're so pretty.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.128
Um...

25:47.963 --> 25:50.131
Hi. I'm Wayne.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.677
-Alex.
-The writer.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.638
Yeah.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.767
You smell good. I just smelled you.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.811
Not on purpose.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.273
Um...

26:09.317 --> 26:11.861
-Do you want a drink?
-Please, God.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.785
Hmm.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.373
Do you want to give me a tour?

26:26.334 --> 26:27.335
Uh...

26:27.419 --> 26:29.254
I think you get it. Uh...

26:31.172 --> 26:32.507
This is the kitchen.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.302
Yes. Clean.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.763
We have a really good maid.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.318
So how do you like Missoula?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.196
It's good.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.449
Teachers are really good.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.826
I just wanna write, so...

27:00.368 --> 27:02.746
You know who has
a great fiction writing program?

27:03.413 --> 27:04.456
The New School.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.668
-You ever thought about New York?
-It's expensive.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.881
Your dad can't help you out?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.759
I don't take money from him.

27:16.343 --> 27:22.932
He, uh, divorced my mom when I was 6
and became a born-again Christian,

27:23.016 --> 27:26.728
and started a whole new family
that I'm not a part of.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.232
What about mom? Are you close with her?

27:33.401 --> 27:36.738
She's undiagnosed bipolar, so no.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.532
Damn, I'm sorry.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.826
I feel like a dick now.

27:41.910 --> 27:46.915
My biggest complaint about my parents is,
like, they send me too many e-mails, so...

27:48.333 --> 27:52.754
-Your parents pay for your school?
-No. Not my school, just my apartment.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.590
They bought it for me as an investment.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.802
Your parents bought you an apartment?
In Manhattan?

27:58.885 --> 28:00.095
Yeah.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.974
But I don't like taking money from them.

28:05.809 --> 28:09.437
Being around them makes me feel...
It makes me feel lonely.

28:10.105 --> 28:14.150
We get together twice a year, maybe,
and we just sit around on our phones,

28:14.776 --> 28:16.486
waiting for the day to end.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.490
How about you? Where were you today?

28:24.661 --> 28:28.498
Honestly, I've spent the past few
Thanksgivings with my boyfriend.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.587
He has this little niece
that comes over and, uh...

28:36.881 --> 28:38.675
It's usually just the three of us.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.221
But we broke up, so...

28:44.806 --> 28:47.100
This is my first holiday without them.

28:50.061 --> 28:50.979
I'm sorry.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.148
Don't be.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.650
This is what I wanted.

29:04.325 --> 29:07.704
So, what do you...
What do you write about?

29:08.913 --> 29:10.290
What do you make films about?

29:10.373 --> 29:14.669
Nope, we're done talking about me.
Tell me what you're working on.

29:19.215 --> 29:24.179
It's new, so I don't really know
how to talk about it yet.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.396
It's a story about a woman.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.983
I love female protagonists.

29:39.694 --> 29:43.573
She lives in a big, beautiful house.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.328
The kind of house
that's on the cover of magazines.

29:50.079 --> 29:55.084
She has a personal trainer
and a financial adviser.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.505
And an IRA.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.842
She's been to the Louvre more than once.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.973
She spends entire Saturdays...

30:10.642 --> 30:12.644
getting hot-stone massages.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.898
And reading her first-edition books.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.570
She has a cashmere sweater
that makes her feel like...

30:25.073 --> 30:29.369
she's being hugged by 1000 baby lambs.

30:32.288 --> 30:36.668
She wakes up every morning
to a view of the ocean.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.088
Like it exists just for her.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.381
Nice detail.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.426
She has the luxury of time.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.432
No long lines to stand in.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.103
No time cards to punch.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.861
She has time to bake
seven pies from scratch, if she wants to.

31:07.824 --> 31:08.908
What's the conflict?

31:11.911 --> 31:12.745
There isn't one.

31:16.916 --> 31:20.378
-People with money have everything.
-That's not true.

31:21.337 --> 31:24.716
I mean, I have a Peloton,
and I'm miserable.

31:25.216 --> 31:28.261
-You have a Peloton?
-Do I look like I have a Peloton?

31:29.429 --> 31:31.389
You look like you use it as a chair.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.391
Ouch.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.282
Fuck.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.076
-What?
-Fuck. Fuck!

31:52.160 --> 31:54.162
-You gotta go. You gotta go.
-What?

31:54.245 --> 31:55.830
Come on. Put your coat on.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.250
My stepmom's here,
she hates having strangers in the house.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.796
-Come on.
-Okay. Okay.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.008
-Sheesh.
-Around there. Side of the house.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.677
-Can we hang again before I--?
-No. Go! Faster, go!

32:17.185 --> 32:19.437
I'm so sorry.
I was just getting out of here.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.817
Oh.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.236
I was here because of the grout.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.089
You want another glass?

32:47.215 --> 32:48.424
I'm so sorry.

32:49.592 --> 32:50.426
Don't be.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.304
How about some pie?

32:55.098 --> 32:56.057
Want some pie?

32:56.140 --> 32:57.433
No, no, no.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.353
So how was your Thanksgiving?

33:03.231 --> 33:07.276
It was good. I cleaned.

33:09.904 --> 33:14.367
We eat at this table... once a year?

33:17.203 --> 33:18.162
Eight grand.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.208
I paid for it.
I paid for everything in this house.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.003
I work so much

33:25.086 --> 33:27.964
that I don't have time
to sit at this table.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.635
That was always important to me,
that I kept working.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.015
I was already a partner when I met James.

33:37.515 --> 33:41.310
My girlfriends all said,
"Quit! Enjoy your life."

33:42.645 --> 33:44.355
He wanted me to quit too.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.109
But I said, "Absolutely not."

33:48.735 --> 33:50.945
I wanted to respect myself.

33:51.904 --> 33:53.656
I wanted him to respect me.

34:05.126 --> 34:09.547
It's the people you think you know.
That's who you have to worry about.

34:10.256 --> 34:12.050
Because you don't actually know them.

34:13.009 --> 34:16.345
You know the story
you tell yourself about who they are.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.390
So you can get out of bed in the morning.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.146
The last few years...

34:26.981 --> 34:29.108
sometimes I look at my husband...

34:31.527 --> 34:33.029
he's just sitting there.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.657
And he's so beautiful.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.702
And it's not fair.

34:40.703 --> 34:44.248
And it's maybe
what Alzheimer's feels like.

34:45.833 --> 34:49.045
He's familiar, but he's a stranger.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.506
And I know I love him.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.593
But I don't recognize him.

34:59.138 --> 35:05.728
And I just want this alien
to get the fuck out of my house.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.484
I want the real him to come back.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.957
Do you wanna know what's funny?

35:29.418 --> 35:31.754
He left his wife for me
because I was young,

35:31.838 --> 35:35.842
and he'd never had a good relationship
with his kids, and he wanted a do-over.

35:37.802 --> 35:43.558
But unbeknownst to me, I had the
ovarian reserve of a 50-year-old woman.

35:44.433 --> 35:47.311
You probably got pregnant
without even trying, didn't you?

35:47.395 --> 35:48.980
Do you want me to respond?

35:50.523 --> 35:52.775
Sure. Respond.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.280
I got pregnant easy.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.660
But I've had to bust my ass
for everything else.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.495
I'm sure you have.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.540
Let's see now, after...

36:08.958 --> 36:11.544
five years and six rounds of IVF,

36:12.253 --> 36:15.047
one of which
actually made it to nine weeks...

36:15.840 --> 36:17.842
and had a heartbeat, that was thrilling.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.927
After all that,

36:20.469 --> 36:24.557
then there were the meditation retreats,

36:26.475 --> 36:31.397
and even a trip to Mexico
for a Mayan uterus massage.

36:32.148 --> 36:36.152
Three hundred thousand dollars later...

36:38.404 --> 36:39.488
and now...

36:41.949 --> 36:45.870
there is a woman named Joanna in Oregon...

36:47.038 --> 36:50.333
who is five months pregnant with our son.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.335
My son.

36:53.294 --> 36:57.632
And I say that lightly
because we used a donor egg.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.886
All in all,
it took three women to make this baby.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.516
One with the egg, one with the womb,
and one with the money.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.269
Me.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.360
But she does send me pictures.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.572
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

37:23.574 --> 37:24.951
What am I looking at?

37:31.415 --> 37:33.251
Yeah, I think that's his foot.

37:40.883 --> 37:46.055
So then why don't I feel anything?

37:46.847 --> 37:49.058
Being a mother
looks like all kinds of things.

37:52.061 --> 37:55.398
I can understand
how for some women they can accept...

37:56.607 --> 37:59.318
that the baby is theirs, no matter what.

38:00.444 --> 38:03.281
And I really thought
I could be that woman, I...

38:06.367 --> 38:11.289
But after all this time
and all this money...

38:12.707 --> 38:14.083
when I look at that...

38:15.584 --> 38:16.836
I don't feel love.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.798
I don't feel loved.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.303
I just feel desperate.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.893
I never thought I'd do this part alone.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.354
Alone?

38:39.317 --> 38:40.860
James wants a divorce.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.156
I'm sorry.

38:45.239 --> 38:47.616
He told me
on the way to Thanksgiving dinner.

38:49.285 --> 38:54.206
Which has got to be
some sort of record for asshole-ness.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.793
It was not like I didn't see it coming.

39:00.171 --> 39:05.092
With every miscarriage we had,
he just slipped further and further away.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.011
Jesus, what am I doing?

39:26.405 --> 39:29.575
-For the grout.
-No, no. Mm-mm. No.

39:29.658 --> 39:32.119
It's fucking sparkling in here, Alex.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.540
Don't ever let anybody
take advantage of you.

39:38.084 --> 39:42.838
Make you feel "less than"
for all of your hard work.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.174
Work.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.136
It's the one thing you can count on.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.391
Everything else is fragile.

39:55.434 --> 39:56.310
Okay?

39:59.647 --> 40:00.481
Okay.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.527
Take the pies too.

40:05.945 --> 40:06.779
No.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.197
Please.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.287
Can I see a picture of your daughter?

40:16.455 --> 40:17.373
Of course.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.212
How old is she?

40:23.295 --> 40:24.588
She's almost 3.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.135
And you're doing it alone?

40:32.054 --> 40:33.764
Do you like being a mom?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.809
I live for my daughter.

40:41.313 --> 40:42.231
You can go.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.611
Close the gate on your way out.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.029
Okay.

40:49.989 --> 40:50.823
Okay.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.603
Confessions of a Maid.

41:22.229 --> 41:24.523
People keep weird things in their drawers.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.319
And I could list them all here.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.323
But instead, here's what I'll confess.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.783
Cleaning people's houses means

41:34.867 --> 41:38.787
I spend hours dusting credenzas
that could put me through college,

41:39.455 --> 41:42.833
washing floors made of wood
that could buy me a house.

41:45.461 --> 41:48.339
It's hard not to want
their things, their lives.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.300
No, "want" is too soft a word. Covet.

41:51.383 --> 41:54.178
It's hard not to covet
these lives that you ache for,

41:54.261 --> 41:57.681
because it all looks so easy, so pleasant.

41:58.265 --> 42:03.646
The coconut waters, the shelves of books,
the infinity pools, the ice-cold Sancerre.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.233
But the truth is,

42:08.108 --> 42:10.528
despite being wealthy
and living in a dream house

42:10.611 --> 42:14.573
with marbled bathrooms
and floor-to-ceiling views of the sea,

42:15.241 --> 42:17.034
their lives are still lacking.

42:19.370 --> 42:23.791
Maybe all those long hallways and
walk-in closets are just hiding places.

42:24.917 --> 42:28.254
Maybe all that glass
just shows you your own loneliness.

42:31.507 --> 42:36.220
Maybe when you live in a house that big,
you lose yourself in it.

42:38.389 --> 42:41.767
When I think about the house
that I want for my daughter and me,

42:41.850 --> 42:44.770
it's not big and full of stuff.

42:46.897 --> 42:51.026
There's a bed for each of us,
a surface for me to write on.

42:53.153 --> 42:56.031
Maybe a yard for a big, dumb dog someday.

42:58.867 --> 43:02.746
But our space is a home
because we love each other in it.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.020
Say, "Hi, Mommy."

43:27.104 --> 43:30.649
What? Hi, hi, hi.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.735
Oh...

43:36.322 --> 43:37.656
How was your Turkey Day?

43:37.740 --> 43:41.118
It was good, we had cranberry sauce.
Not a fan.

43:41.201 --> 43:44.079
Oh, my goodness, I missed you.
I missed you. I missed you.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.414
We missed you too.

43:45.497 --> 43:49.209
I thought maybe
you'd change your mind and come by.

43:50.502 --> 43:53.756
I don't wanna confuse her
about where Mommy lives.

43:57.968 --> 44:01.221
-Did she eat yet?
-Yep, scrambled eggs.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.182
Thanks.

44:04.933 --> 44:09.396
-So how was your lonely Thanksgiving?
-It was okay. Kind of nice, actually.

44:13.525 --> 44:14.652
I saw you on Tinder.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.280
I saw you on Tinder.

44:21.575 --> 44:25.496
-So you'll pick her up Friday?
-Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.332
Okay. Thanks.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.751
Why don't you give your daddy
a big kiss goodbye?

44:31.835 --> 44:32.961
See you Friday.

44:34.004 --> 44:36.882
Bye, Maddy! Bye, Mad-dog!

44:37.925 --> 44:39.718
-Thank you.
-You guys have fun.

44:40.219 --> 44:43.889
Guess what. Do you like pie? Are you sure?

44:43.972 --> 44:45.182
Good news for you.

44:45.766 --> 44:49.853
I have seven whole pies at home.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.731
-Seven?
-Seven whole pies.

45:12.793 --> 45:16.004
All right, buddy, let's roll.
What do you say?
