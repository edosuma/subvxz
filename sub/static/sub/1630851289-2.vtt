00:02.394 --> 00:04.294
♪

00:18.911 --> 00:21.912
TINA:
Uh...

00:21.914 --> 00:23.580
Did someone switch Tina
to white noise?

00:23.673 --> 00:26.859
Tina, sweetie, why are you
making your sad mumble grumbles?

00:27.086 --> 00:29.028
I'm just nervous
about the oral report

00:29.255 --> 00:30.195
I have to give in class today.

00:30.422 --> 00:32.606
For Wagstaff
75th Anniversary Week.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.757
Ooh, right!

00:33.776 --> 00:35.701
The 75th anniversary thing.

00:35.928 --> 00:36.976
That school's
getting up there, huh?

00:37.054 --> 00:38.762
Yeah, it looks much younger,

00:38.781 --> 00:39.780
but it had a lot of work done.

00:39.932 --> 00:40.855
-Boob job.
-BOB: Mm.

00:40.949 --> 00:42.041
Our class had to make posters

00:42.268 --> 00:43.767
for the anniversary assembly.

00:43.860 --> 00:45.193
Also, breaking news--

00:45.287 --> 00:47.046
fourth graders don't know
how to spell "anniversary."

00:47.197 --> 00:48.863
Well, Tina,
I'm sure you'll do great,

00:48.957 --> 00:50.198
even though sometimes you get

00:50.292 --> 00:51.792
a debilitating fear
of public speaking.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.944
Sorry, pretend
I didn't say that last part.

00:53.962 --> 00:56.037
It's not just that.
This is a speech with a partner.

00:56.131 --> 00:57.723
Zeke and I are doing
a report together.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.783
Wait.
Why is having a partner bad?

00:59.952 --> 01:01.376
(sighs)
I kind of have a reputation

01:01.512 --> 01:04.288
when it comes to doing
oral reports with partners.

01:04.381 --> 01:05.747
They call her "the cooler."

01:05.808 --> 01:07.791
She'll take your perfectly good
oral presentation

01:07.884 --> 01:09.626
and throw a bunch
of cold sweat on it.

01:09.795 --> 01:10.885
They also call her the cooler

01:10.979 --> 01:12.296
because you can sit on her
at the beach.

01:12.464 --> 01:14.722
I just don't want to let
my partner down, so

01:14.800 --> 01:15.890
I get all nervous and sweaty

01:15.910 --> 01:17.134
and I mess up
my note cards and...

01:17.227 --> 01:18.985
(hacks)
...my mouth gets all phlegmy,

01:19.080 --> 01:21.413
(thickly): like right now,
'cause I'm thinking about it.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.989
Okay, calm down.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.991
You know, maybe just picture
everyone with a giant booger

01:25.160 --> 01:26.643
that's trapped
in their nose hairs

01:26.662 --> 01:28.645
and they look ridiculous.
Speaking of...

01:28.647 --> 01:29.980
-Bob. Nose hairs.
-Oh.

01:29.998 --> 01:31.315
Uh, well, I gotta go.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.333
Not because I had a booger
in my nose.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.152
I'm gonna go to
the Tuesday farmers market

01:35.154 --> 01:36.428
in Bog Harbor for produce.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.764
That's what Dad says
when he goes to his mistress.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.582
Tina, I'm sorry about
the sweat stuff.

01:40.676 --> 01:41.916
Y-You get that from me.

01:42.010 --> 01:44.010
Sometimes I put rolled up
socks under my arms.

01:44.163 --> 01:46.254
No wonder this guy's
got a mistress.

01:46.332 --> 01:48.089
ZEKE:
Hey, partner!

01:48.167 --> 01:50.925
I'm real excited
about our report today.

01:51.003 --> 01:52.260
Hey, Zeke. Uh, yup!

01:52.429 --> 01:53.928
I mean, I'm not nervous
or anything. I-I feel great.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.114
Tell that to your pits.

01:55.341 --> 01:56.431
Ah!

01:56.600 --> 01:57.858
Anyone have an extra pair
of socks I can borrow?

01:57.934 --> 01:59.042
For... no reason?

01:59.044 --> 02:00.268
I have extra socks,

02:00.362 --> 02:02.103
but I'm wearing them
over my other socks.

02:02.272 --> 02:03.956
Why do you have
all those clothes on?

02:04.183 --> 02:06.941
Jocelyn and I are doing our
Wagstaff Anniversary report

02:07.002 --> 02:09.369
on what popular people wore,
past and present.

02:09.446 --> 02:12.131
We're gonna take off layers
to reveal popular people clothes

02:12.358 --> 02:14.541
from different decades.
Yes, you're jealous.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.802
Who's jealous?
Oh, them.

02:17.029 --> 02:18.453
-(school bell ringing)
-See ya later, Tina!

02:18.547 --> 02:20.030
We got this, right?

02:20.032 --> 02:20.881
Yeah, totally, thumbs up!

02:20.975 --> 02:23.700
Oh, God. (panting)

02:23.793 --> 02:24.718
Tina. Are you okay?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.127
Yeah, really great.
(panting)

02:26.221 --> 02:27.962
Okay, I think I know
what's going on.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.314
Let's go to my office.

02:29.391 --> 02:32.634
This seems like a situation
for the Anxiety Society.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.135
So, Panicky Paul,

02:34.229 --> 02:36.971
Nervous Nellie, and Worry Murray
have all experienced

02:37.065 --> 02:39.474
what you're experiencing.
Isn't that nice?

02:39.568 --> 02:42.736
It's just-- I have to give
an oral report with Zeke...

02:42.888 --> 02:44.663
-(phone chimes)
-(stammering)

02:44.890 --> 02:45.813
I just got a text.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.890
Oh, my God,
it's from Cassie.

02:46.983 --> 02:48.024
She's a person I'm dating.

02:48.151 --> 02:49.668
Twice.
We went on two dates.

02:49.895 --> 02:51.486
Um, okay...

02:51.505 --> 02:52.579
(giddy laugh)

02:52.731 --> 02:53.580
Cassie had a nice time
last night.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.898
What do I write back?

02:55.067 --> 02:57.234
Maybe... say you had
a nice time, too?

02:57.252 --> 02:58.159
Ooh, that's good!

02:58.179 --> 03:00.237
Uh... Okay, Tina, back to you.

03:00.297 --> 03:02.514
Did the dolls work, or...
what are we doing?

03:02.666 --> 03:03.682
Uh... A little?

03:03.909 --> 03:05.425
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
See this crystal?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.593
Cassie gave it to me.

03:06.762 --> 03:07.911
That's... nice.

03:07.913 --> 03:09.262
She says it brings
good energy

03:09.356 --> 03:10.689
to whoever is
in possession of it.

03:10.916 --> 03:12.006
I-I think that's how she put it.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.251
Are you saying
maybe it could help me?

03:14.269 --> 03:15.919
What?
Oh, because of your thing?

03:16.012 --> 03:17.771
With the nervousness?
Maybe.

03:17.923 --> 03:19.423
I mean, Cassie's so pretty.

03:19.516 --> 03:20.590
And her car was so clean.

03:20.609 --> 03:22.367
So, maybe she's right...
about crystals.

03:22.444 --> 03:23.017
So, yeah,

03:23.186 --> 03:24.203
go ahead and borrow it.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.946
Okay. I mean,
I guess it can't hurt.

03:26.022 --> 03:27.280
Unless it's sharp.
Ow.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.208
That part's a little sharp.
Thanks, Mr. Frond.

03:29.435 --> 03:30.858
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How does this look?

03:31.027 --> 03:32.193
Maybe just one full line

03:32.287 --> 03:34.104
of exclamation points
instead of two?

03:34.106 --> 03:36.089
But then how will she know
I'm excited?

03:36.942 --> 03:38.032
He's back!

03:38.126 --> 03:39.943
Oh, thank God.
I was worried about you.

03:40.036 --> 03:42.112
Why? I was just at
the farmers market.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.780
Yeah, but you know
how farmers get.

03:43.873 --> 03:45.057
With their pitchforks.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.117
Whoa, that's a big box
of fruits and veggies.

03:47.135 --> 03:49.061
Yeah, and I got a huge discount
on all this, too.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.063
Look at this carrot.
It's got legs.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.973
We could put a little pair
of pants on it.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.641
And this tomato's all lumpy.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.884
Wait a minute, all this stuff
in here is weird-looking.

03:56.886 --> 03:58.144
Yeah, that's why
it was so cheap.

03:58.297 --> 04:00.572
Also, it's all
about to go rotten.

04:00.799 --> 04:02.132
Uh... yum.

04:02.225 --> 04:04.134
People get so judgmental
about how food looks.

04:04.152 --> 04:07.395
I mean, ugly, soft,
discolored food is food, too.

04:07.489 --> 04:08.580
No, it's not. Sorry.

04:08.807 --> 04:11.065
I'm proud of you, Bobby.
You saved all this food.

04:11.159 --> 04:12.826
Yeah. I mean,
nobody at the farmers market

04:12.995 --> 04:14.327
said the word "hero,"

04:14.480 --> 04:16.146
but I think
they were thinking it.

04:16.164 --> 04:18.148
Hey, Linda, can you turn
the tomato that way?

04:18.166 --> 04:19.925
So it's not looking
right at me

04:20.076 --> 04:21.167
with its weird tomato eyes?

04:21.320 --> 04:23.003
Okay,
but the other side's worse.

04:23.079 --> 04:25.155
-Ah!
-And here comes Mr. Carrot.

04:25.248 --> 04:27.657
(as carrot):
I'm coming to say hi
to you, Teddy.

04:27.826 --> 04:29.250
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

04:29.328 --> 04:31.328
...and in the '90s,

04:31.421 --> 04:33.939
popular people at Wagstaff wore
baby doll dresses

04:34.166 --> 04:36.683
like Wynona Ryder did
in Reality Bites,

04:36.760 --> 04:38.001
which is
my dad's favorite movie

04:38.094 --> 04:40.003
and also the password
for his laptop.

04:40.096 --> 04:42.096
And these are lace-up jeans
from the 2000s.

04:42.190 --> 04:44.007
It's like your pants are shoes.

04:44.009 --> 04:45.358
And these are our clothes.

04:45.435 --> 04:47.694
Because we're great.
So, yeah, the end.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.362
Thank you, Tammy and Jocelyn.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.790
That was...
an example of what happens

04:51.959 --> 04:53.458
when I don't vet
your report topics.

04:53.685 --> 04:55.869
Okay! Tina, Zeke,
let's hear your report

04:55.963 --> 04:58.021
on Wagstaff's Amazing Alumni.

04:58.023 --> 04:59.205
(quietly):
You ready?

04:59.358 --> 05:00.966
(exhaling deeply)

05:01.193 --> 05:02.283
Okay, let me know
when you're, uh,

05:02.377 --> 05:04.636
at the end of that deep breath
and we'll start.

05:04.788 --> 05:05.712
(stops exhaling)
Ready.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.197
Hey, Tina, when you look back

05:07.290 --> 05:10.050
at 75 years of Wagstaff,
what do you see?

05:10.202 --> 05:11.143
What do I see?

05:11.294 --> 05:12.794
I Spy Amazing Alumni!

05:12.888 --> 05:14.387
-(quietly): Nice.
-Thanks.

05:14.556 --> 05:15.555
Hey, you know what, Zeke?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.499
Let's talk about
those amazing alumni.

05:17.559 --> 05:18.875
Alumn-I'd love to!

05:18.968 --> 05:20.226
(quietly):
We're killing it.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.969
Tina, you knocked it
out of the park.

05:22.064 --> 05:24.472
Yeah, you didn't get all sweaty
like you usually do.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.307
It's true.
The report went pretty smoothly.

05:26.401 --> 05:27.884
And this thing
only stabbed me once.

05:27.903 --> 05:29.235
-Whoa.
-Is that a diamond?

05:29.312 --> 05:30.887
Did you steal that
from a scepter?

05:30.980 --> 05:31.997
Oh. No, it's a crystal.

05:32.224 --> 05:33.239
Mr. Frond let me borrow it

05:33.316 --> 05:34.816
'cause I was nervous
about our report.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.484
The woman he's dating
gave it to him.

05:36.578 --> 05:37.836
She said it brings
good energy.

05:38.063 --> 05:40.397
-Good energy like a protein bar?
-Mm, no.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.399
Tina, Zeke,
I'm supposed to select

05:42.401 --> 05:45.085
some of the oral reports
to be given again tomorrow

05:45.161 --> 05:46.753
at the Wagstaff
Anniversary assembly

05:46.847 --> 05:48.088
and I'm choosing you guys.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.997
-Oh, my God!
-Do what?
-Yep.

05:50.075 --> 05:51.666
And Tammy, Jocelyn,

05:51.743 --> 05:53.927
since you two were
the only other people

05:54.079 --> 05:55.187
who didn't just read from

05:55.356 --> 05:57.263
the school website's
"about us" section,

05:57.358 --> 05:58.932
you will also be presenting
your report at the assembly.

05:59.084 --> 06:00.266
BOTH:
Wow.

06:00.435 --> 06:01.084
I mean, yay!

06:01.177 --> 06:02.268
What do you say, Tina?

06:02.363 --> 06:04.178
You up for doing this
again tomorrow?

06:04.272 --> 06:05.755
CRYSTAL:
You can do it if I'm with you,
Tina.

06:05.849 --> 06:07.014
Also, it might feel cool

06:07.183 --> 06:08.516
if you press me
to your face right now.

06:08.594 --> 06:10.427
Or do it later, maybe.
People might not get it.

06:10.429 --> 06:12.854
Here's an oral report, Zeke--
Let's do it!

06:13.022 --> 06:14.664
That's not really
a report, but yeah!

06:19.028 --> 06:20.361
Tina, I'm so proud of you!

06:20.439 --> 06:22.606
My little lordy lordy,
look who's doing her report-y

06:22.699 --> 06:24.124
in front of the whole school!

06:24.200 --> 06:26.610
Yeah, you went from scaredy-cat
to She's All That.

06:26.703 --> 06:30.222
So, Tina, you think a crystal
made you do well on your report?

06:30.298 --> 06:31.965
I mean, I don't know
if I like your tone.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.118
But yes. Maybe.
I'm not sure.

06:35.137 --> 06:36.803
I'm just saying, it could be
that you practiced a lot.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.563
Like, over and over.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.898
Like, a few times, I thought
you were talking to me,

06:39.975 --> 06:41.400
'cause you were staring
right at me

06:41.627 --> 06:42.567
and I said "What, Tina?"

06:42.794 --> 06:44.552
And you just kept talking
about alumni.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.738
Look. All I can say is
before I got this crystal,

06:46.965 --> 06:48.815
I was the cooler,
and then yesterday I wasn't.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.150
I was the... furnace.

06:50.302 --> 06:51.801
-The Her-nace.
-Uh, Mom,

06:51.895 --> 06:53.245
is this dinner?

06:53.396 --> 06:54.654
It's, like, all vegetables

06:54.748 --> 06:56.156
and I don't have
enough places to hide them.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.324
Well, your dad bought
a giant box of weird produce

06:58.419 --> 06:59.918
for the restaurant
and there's no way

07:00.069 --> 07:01.661
we're gonna be able
to use it all down there,

07:01.830 --> 07:02.904
so I brought some up here.

07:02.998 --> 07:03.997
And this is our life now.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.757
I smell a reality show.

07:05.834 --> 07:08.835
Hey, you kids want to take
these apples to school?

07:08.929 --> 07:09.911
Give 'em to your teachers?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.746
Are you sure that's an apple?

07:11.823 --> 07:13.156
It's fine. It's natural.

07:13.249 --> 07:15.082
That's how apples look
sometimes.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.493
It kinda looks like
Dad's butt.

07:16.586 --> 07:18.662
-But not as red.
-Oh, yeah. It does.

07:18.664 --> 07:19.980
BOB:
Mm.

07:20.832 --> 07:22.089
Hey, Mr. Frond. So...

07:22.167 --> 07:23.758
-about this crystal
you loaned me...
-Uh-huh...

07:23.852 --> 07:25.852
Um, is it okay if I keep it
for the assembly today?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.337
Uh, yeah, sure.

07:27.430 --> 07:28.672
Big things are happening,
Tina.

07:28.674 --> 07:31.098
I'm asking Cassie out
on a third date.

07:31.193 --> 07:32.342
What do you think of this?

07:32.360 --> 07:33.952
"Want to come over
for dinner tonight?

07:34.179 --> 07:35.454
"I make a mean casserole.

07:35.681 --> 07:37.514
"Or in your case,
a Cassie-role.

07:37.532 --> 07:39.958
"LOL. I told you
I can be funny sometimes.

07:40.185 --> 07:42.127
Anyway,
this is Phillip Frond."

07:42.354 --> 07:43.444
Um... Perfect?

07:43.464 --> 07:46.523
Great. Adding a heart,
heart, heart, heart,

07:46.616 --> 07:47.707
heart and send.

07:47.859 --> 07:49.693
You got this, Zeke.

07:49.786 --> 07:50.802
There's my partner!

07:51.029 --> 07:52.119
-Don't talk!
-What are you guys doing?

07:52.214 --> 07:53.788
Zeke is trying
to break his record

07:53.865 --> 07:56.716
for how long he can hold up
a pencil with his lip.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.867
-(straining)
-You know, I never think

07:57.961 --> 07:59.052
school's gonna be interesting

07:59.204 --> 08:00.479
and then something
like this happens.

08:00.630 --> 08:02.539
Oh, my gosh, Zeke,
three more seconds.

08:02.632 --> 08:03.707
Two. One.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.041
New record!

08:05.060 --> 08:06.876
I'm the holding up a pencil
with my lip champ!

08:06.895 --> 08:08.545
I think you can quit school now.

08:08.638 --> 08:10.655
Hey! I bet it was because
Tina was here.

08:10.882 --> 08:12.232
-With the crystal.
-Oh, yeah.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.384
Hey, Tina, can I borrow
the crystal for PE today?

08:14.386 --> 08:16.328
We're running hurdles and
I want to clear all of them.

08:16.479 --> 08:18.145
So I don't hit my penis
like last time.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.999
Uh... No.
Mr. Frond trusted me with it

08:21.226 --> 08:23.059
and I don't think
I should lend it out.

08:23.152 --> 08:24.318
Hey, I wasn't holding
the crystal

08:24.412 --> 08:25.987
when I broke
my lip pencil record.

08:26.064 --> 08:27.247
Tina was just
standing near me.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.898
Maybe if she's just there,

08:28.900 --> 08:29.841
you won't hit your poor penis.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.751
Oh, yeah.
Tina, could you do that?

08:31.845 --> 08:34.087
-Sure. I guess.
-Great, let's go.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.515
Huh. They think Tina
and her crystal have powers.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.833
That rock could make us
some paper.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.502
And maybe some money, too.

08:42.264 --> 08:45.339
Oh, sir! Don't forget
your free fruit or vegetable.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.751
-What?
-Yeah, one with every meal.

08:47.753 --> 08:48.935
-Take it!
-Oh...

08:49.029 --> 08:50.529
I think I'm just gonna go?

08:50.756 --> 08:52.589
Sorry, Linda. His loss.

08:52.591 --> 08:53.757
Yeah. You want it, Mort?

08:53.850 --> 08:55.091
Uh...

08:55.184 --> 08:56.276
-Here's your burger, Teddy.
-Oh, thanks.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.111
Whoa. What's that?
What's happening?

08:58.263 --> 08:59.946
Uh, we're trying out
a new thing.

09:00.098 --> 09:02.023
A side salad is included
with your meal.

09:02.117 --> 09:04.100
Eh, no thanks. It looks weird.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.860
It doesn't matter
what it looks like, Teddy.

09:05.937 --> 09:06.936
Close your eyes and eat it.

09:07.030 --> 09:08.271
Bob, I know what you're doing.

09:08.364 --> 09:10.273
You're trying to get rid of
your weird vegetables.

09:10.366 --> 09:11.699
I'm not a garbage disposal.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.052
You kind of are. You ate
that lemon rind that time.

09:14.279 --> 09:15.128
Oh, this again?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.871
You put a lemon wedge
on my plate.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.223
What do you think
a guy's gonna do?

09:18.300 --> 09:20.283
At least it was
a normal-looking lemon.

09:20.302 --> 09:21.618
Bob, let's face it.

09:21.636 --> 09:23.453
Even with the salads
and the free ugly food bowl,

09:23.546 --> 09:26.122
we're not gonna get through all
this stuff before it goes bad.

09:26.141 --> 09:27.807
I think we might have
to throw out the food

09:27.901 --> 09:29.234
we didn't want
anyone to throw out.

09:29.461 --> 09:31.236
-Don't say that!
-I mean,
what are we supposed to do

09:31.387 --> 09:33.313
with this sad, old cucumber
that's at the end of its life?

09:33.465 --> 09:35.407
Oh, actually,
this one's going to Mort.

09:35.483 --> 09:36.633
Right. Yay.

09:36.726 --> 09:38.076
Wait! That's it!

09:38.303 --> 09:40.728
I-I know what we can do!
We'll just do what Mort does.

09:40.897 --> 09:41.988
Eat real slow

09:42.065 --> 09:43.640
-and chew a million times?
-What?

09:43.733 --> 09:44.808
-We pickle it.
-(gasps)

09:44.901 --> 09:46.901
Ooh! Good idea, Bob!

09:46.995 --> 09:48.569
Why is that like what I do?

09:48.738 --> 09:49.921
You know, like embalming.

09:50.148 --> 09:51.981
That's not even really...
Okay, never mind.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.408
Ooh! All of the sudden
I'm feeling picklish!

09:54.502 --> 09:55.242
All right!

09:55.337 --> 09:57.153
Tina, my favorite sister...

09:57.246 --> 09:59.431
-Hey!
-And there's the crystal.

09:59.658 --> 10:00.414
Good, good.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.749
You know, I've been thinking.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.993
You and this crystal could
help a lot of people.

10:03.995 --> 10:05.419
And I feel like it's our duty

10:05.497 --> 10:07.772
to find these people
and ask for a small fee

10:07.999 --> 10:09.441
in order for you to stand
next to them.

10:09.668 --> 10:11.167
-Uh...
-You love it.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.426
Anyway, here's Peter Pescadero.

10:12.504 --> 10:13.945
And for the low,
low price of fifty cents,

10:14.172 --> 10:15.947
he'd like
some crystal Tina time.

10:16.024 --> 10:17.523
-Wait. What?
-I've been working on

10:17.676 --> 10:18.933
my breakdancing moves,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.452
but I still can't crack
the windmill.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.196
There's a crack in my windmill.
This guy.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.531
Could you just stand near me
while I practice for one second?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.033
Oh. I guess...

10:27.185 --> 10:28.793
But I can't promise anything
is going to happen.

10:28.945 --> 10:30.536
You can do this, Peter.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.613
Windmill...!

10:32.633 --> 10:34.949
He's doing it. I think.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.968
Okay, Rudy,
go ask Chloe your question.

10:37.195 --> 10:39.804
I mean, I still think
she's a dumb shampoo bottle

10:39.881 --> 10:40.805
in the shape of a person.

10:41.032 --> 10:42.623
But you paid your money,
so have at it.

10:42.717 --> 10:44.309
Bring it home, Rudy.

10:44.536 --> 10:46.703
Hey, Chloe. How about you and I
be science partners today?

10:46.796 --> 10:49.648
Um, I was gonna be
Emmy Butler's partner today.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.224
-Oh.
-But then she got sick,

10:51.300 --> 10:54.043
which is gross, so yeah.
Just for today.

10:54.137 --> 10:56.379
And maybe you do all
the experiments for both of us.

10:56.472 --> 10:58.715
'Cause I don't like wearing
the goggles. They hurt my hair.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.066
-Yes!
-Barf.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.734
I can't believe I'm doing this.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.977
Eh, what the heck?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.570
It's for online poker.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.072
I never go all in like this.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.090
But screw it, I like this hand.

11:08.092 --> 11:09.409
Is it a royal flush?

11:09.503 --> 11:10.835
That's the only poker hand
I know

11:11.062 --> 11:12.395
because it sounds like
a fancy poop.

11:12.564 --> 11:13.579
-(computer chimes)
-(gasps)

11:13.656 --> 11:15.340
Oh, my God, I won! I won!

11:15.417 --> 11:17.676
You know, the right thing
to do is to give us half.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.585
-No.
-We'll talk later.

11:19.662 --> 11:20.995
Today is the best day

11:21.014 --> 11:22.405
of this young man's life.

11:22.498 --> 11:24.924
I finally got the corner piece
of the mac and cheese.

11:25.001 --> 11:26.333
-Crystal worked again, huh?
-Yup.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.353
Every other time I've asked,
Hildy said,

11:28.430 --> 11:30.504
"You get what you get
and you don't get upset."

11:30.582 --> 11:32.524
But this time,
Tina's crystal was there

11:32.751 --> 11:34.675
and now I'm
in the corner suite, baby!

11:34.695 --> 11:36.102
Well, eat up.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.696
We got some more crystal
customers booked after lunch.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.197
Actually, I was thinking

11:39.424 --> 11:40.865
we should give
the crystal a rest.

11:41.017 --> 11:42.200
I'm not sure exactly
how it works,

11:42.427 --> 11:44.736
but, uh... maybe we should
save some of its powers

11:44.963 --> 11:46.037
for me and the assembly?

11:46.264 --> 11:47.706
I mean, I don't know
how to recharge this thing.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.023
I bet Billy Crystal would know.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.208
Tina! There you are.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.119
Cassie said yes
to having Cassie-role with me.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.713
Also, she asked me
about the crystal

11:54.940 --> 11:56.272
and I said I was enjoying it
very much.

11:56.441 --> 11:58.550
So I will be needing it back
after you give your speech.

11:58.777 --> 11:59.884
JOCELYN:
Ah!

12:00.036 --> 12:01.202
You okay, Jocelyn?

12:01.370 --> 12:03.780
I'm fine.
I tripped on my jean laces.

12:03.798 --> 12:06.891
So, Tina, as I was saying,
I'll need the crystal back.

12:06.968 --> 12:09.302
Okay, Mr. Frond. I'll give it
back to you after the assembly.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.895
And don't worry,
I'm taking good care of it.

12:11.122 --> 12:12.379
Oh, my God! It's gone!

12:12.457 --> 12:13.898
(high-pitched):
What do you mean, "it's gone"?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.549
It was right here
just a second ago!

12:15.569 --> 12:16.976
So was my mac and cheese!

12:17.128 --> 12:19.028
Oh, no. It's there.
Hi, you.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.225
(high-pitched):
Where's Cassie's crystal?

12:24.302 --> 12:26.060
Yeah, Tina!
Where's Cassie's crystal?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.820
It was right there!
On the table!

12:27.973 --> 12:30.156
Ugh. One of the alumni keeps
texting me.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.641
He wants to know
where to park his scooter.

12:31.659 --> 12:34.160
Tina, I need the crystal back
by the end of the day.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.646
Or else my Cassie-role
is grass.

12:36.664 --> 12:38.089
Oh, my God.

12:38.316 --> 12:39.983
If we don't find it,
my Cassie-role is grass, too!

12:40.001 --> 12:41.317
I'll have to do
the report with Zeke

12:41.410 --> 12:43.319
in front of the whole school
with no crystal!

12:43.412 --> 12:44.745
Someone must've stolen it.

12:44.839 --> 12:46.656
And during peak
crystal business hours.

12:46.674 --> 12:47.991
We gotta find this monster.

12:48.009 --> 12:49.934
And we'll start
right after lunch.

12:50.161 --> 12:51.327
-Gene...
-Fine.

12:51.346 --> 12:53.162

-The vinegar. Ugh.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.025
It's really strong.

13:22.027 --> 13:23.284
We might've pickled
our whole restaurant.

Wh-Why can't I smell it?

13:24.787 --> 13:26.879
You're pickled. Go to the

Okay...
Going down, going down.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.551
It's really dirty down here,
we should clean it.

Oh, God!

What have we done?
You did this to us!

No! They're just ugly!

Same thing!

13:42.047 --> 13:43.637
This is going to destroy

13:43.657 --> 13:45.048
everything we built together.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.382
Wait, I can't smell it anymore.

13:46.401 --> 13:48.142
(sniffs) Yeah. Me, neither.

13:48.236 --> 13:49.160

-Yeah, it's kinda fun.

before then.

13:55.743 --> 13:56.893

13:56.986 --> 13:58.485

Tammy has it.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.745
What? No, I don't!

13:59.898 --> 14:00.988
Wait a minute.

14:01.066 --> 14:02.415
You had Jocelyn
create a distraction

14:02.509 --> 14:05.585
in the cafeteria with her big,
dramatic fall, didn't you?

14:05.661 --> 14:08.346
No. You know Jocelyn's knees
don't bend right.

14:08.423 --> 14:09.922
Give me back my crystal, Tammy!

14:10.075 --> 14:12.183
It's not your crystal, Tina.

14:12.335 --> 14:14.744
It's Mr. Frond's.
You borrowed it from him.

14:14.837 --> 14:16.354
And maybe I borrowed it from you

14:16.581 --> 14:17.914
and I'm gonna give it
back to Mr. Frond

14:18.007 --> 14:19.173
when I am done with it.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.751
Because maybe I need
some crystal power.

14:21.753 --> 14:22.919
What are you talking about?

14:22.921 --> 14:24.178
I found out that
one of the alumni

14:24.180 --> 14:25.196
who's coming to the assembly

14:25.423 --> 14:27.256
is the woman who owns
the boutique

14:27.275 --> 14:28.349
Mary Queen of Skorts.

14:28.443 --> 14:30.034
Yeah, I know,
she was in my report.

14:30.186 --> 14:34.038
Yeah. And she's in
the fashion industry, Tina. Uh.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.707
If she likes my presentation,

14:35.934 --> 14:37.208
she might take me
under her wing.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.210
I could be Anne Hathaway
to her Meryl Streep,

14:39.437 --> 14:40.937
but I'd be blonde,
which is even better.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.213
Oops, oops, oops, oops.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.773
Something's falling
out of my hands

14:43.866 --> 14:44.883
and into my locker
and it's closed.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.792
-(Tammy humming)
-(groans)

14:46.945 --> 14:47.960
Now what do we do?

14:48.129 --> 14:49.036
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.555
We're gonna go to class,

14:50.632 --> 14:51.705
get some bathroom passes,

14:51.783 --> 14:53.207
and break into Tammy's locker.

14:53.301 --> 14:55.226
And then what?
Oh. Right. Get the crystal.

14:55.378 --> 14:57.878
Glad you came back for
a second lunch, Teddy.

14:57.972 --> 15:00.289
Because now you get to try
the quick pickles.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.641
They should be ready.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.067
Oh, what a surprise.

15:03.294 --> 15:05.311
Bob is trying to foist
his ugly vegetables on people.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.980
I'm ignoring that,
because they're pickles now.

15:08.057 --> 15:09.073
They're reborn.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.724
They're pretty
pickle butterflies.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.893
(sniffs) And I won't smell
like this forever, right?

15:12.913 --> 15:14.820
-Right?
-Pickled carrot, anyone?

15:14.897 --> 15:16.581
-Ah, no thanks.
-I'll try it.

15:16.808 --> 15:19.825
Mmm. You can't even taste
how mangled it looked.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.252
Pickled cauliflower?

15:21.438 --> 15:22.587
I think that's a strawberry.

15:22.664 --> 15:23.996
Oh, my God, I think
that is a strawberry.

15:24.165 --> 15:26.407
-Teddy?
-Eh... Nah, I'm gonna pass.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.092
You know what, Teddy?
These pickles aren't for you.

15:28.319 --> 15:30.503
They're for people who don't
want to waste food

15:30.597 --> 15:32.413
and want to make
the world a better place.

15:32.507 --> 15:35.007
That strawberry doesn't want to
make the world a better place.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.842
It's frowning. It looks mean.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.585
(as strawberry):
I'm not mean, Teddy,

15:38.663 --> 15:39.845
I'm a nice strawberry.

15:39.998 --> 15:41.422
Ah! Stop it!

15:41.499 --> 15:42.682
Sorry I'm late.

15:42.758 --> 15:44.016
I got my bathroom pass

15:44.169 --> 15:45.001
and then I actually had
to go to the bathroom.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.018
How's it going here?

15:46.171 --> 15:47.946
I mean, I don't feel
totally great

15:48.097 --> 15:49.672
about lying
to get out of class.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.340
And if we don't
get the crystal,

15:51.359 --> 15:52.858
I'm probably gonna have
a super sweaty, phlegmy meltdown

15:53.011 --> 15:54.010
in front of the whole school.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.194
And Mr. Frond's gonna hate me.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.104
-But other than that, fine.
-Great!

15:57.123 --> 15:59.273
Ugh! Everything
at this school is lousy

15:59.292 --> 16:01.017
except for
these weirdly amazing,

16:01.110 --> 16:03.186
-hard-to-break-into lockers.
-(school bell ringing)

16:03.279 --> 16:05.521
This is embarrassing--
Ooh! I got it!

16:05.614 --> 16:06.464
-Yes!
-(gasps)

16:06.691 --> 16:07.707
-Ah!
-Ah!

16:07.801 --> 16:09.542
You guys are stealing
the crystal from me!

16:09.618 --> 16:10.635
You stole it from me!

16:10.712 --> 16:13.029
What does that have to do
with anything?

16:13.047 --> 16:14.455
-(grunting)
-Let go!

16:14.532 --> 16:16.199
(grunting)

16:16.292 --> 16:17.642
-Oh, no!
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

16:17.869 --> 16:19.552
Uh... You know what, Tina?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.220
Uh, you can have it.

16:21.297 --> 16:22.555
See you at the assembly.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.040
Ugh, damn it, Tammy!

16:24.042 --> 16:25.725
(pants)
The crystal! It's dead!

16:25.819 --> 16:27.043
(panting)

16:27.045 --> 16:28.044
Unless it's
one of those crystals

16:28.046 --> 16:29.729
that crawls back together?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.547
-Nope.
-Tina, there you are.

16:31.566 --> 16:32.824
Please tell me you found the...

16:32.900 --> 16:34.659
-(screams)
-I'm so sorry.

16:34.810 --> 16:36.160
(whimpering)

16:36.387 --> 16:37.887
I hear they're doing
great things

16:37.980 --> 16:39.388
with glue these days.
(laughs nervously)

16:39.482 --> 16:40.707
(whispers):
Let's go.

16:44.987 --> 16:46.245
(playing kazoos)

16:46.322 --> 16:47.897
TAMMY:
There's Mary Queen of Skorts.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.340
Should I wave? Hey!

16:49.417 --> 16:51.917
Okay, she didn't wave back
or look in my direction,

16:52.070 --> 16:54.403
but I think she saw me and
was like, "Who's that girl?"

16:54.422 --> 16:56.848
Hey, Tina, you okay?
'Cause you seem kind of nervous.

16:57.075 --> 16:58.516
And you're perspiring-- a lot.

16:58.743 --> 16:59.684
(chuckles)
What?

16:59.835 --> 17:00.910
Don't worry, we'll be all right.

17:01.003 --> 17:02.094
You got the crystal.

17:02.171 --> 17:04.856
Um, yeah, so...
actually, I don't.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.190
Because Tammy stole it

17:06.267 --> 17:07.767
and then we got in a fight
and broke it.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.009
Ugh! Get over it, Tina.

17:09.087 --> 17:10.194
That was like ten minutes ago.

17:10.421 --> 17:12.196
Hold up. You don't have
the crystal, Tina?

17:12.273 --> 17:13.606
-No.
-Oh, boy.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.700
Now I'm sweatin'. Right across
my little, tiny mustache.

17:15.927 --> 17:17.035
It's there.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.612
Thank you, fifth grade,
for that somber rendition

17:19.764 --> 17:22.598
of Matchbox Twenty's
"How Far We've Come."

17:22.691 --> 17:25.376
Kazoos have never sounded
so haunting.

17:25.528 --> 17:27.194
So... Wagstaff.

17:27.288 --> 17:28.529
75 years, huh?

17:28.623 --> 17:31.198
What a rich, wonderful past
this school has had.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.793
But, eventually,
everything is broken.

17:33.945 --> 17:35.127
And dreams die.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.037
-He's taking it well.
-Mm-hmm.

17:37.131 --> 17:39.057
That's it for this jar.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.783
-Served all the pickles.
-Great.

17:40.876 --> 17:43.061
So we'll just keep doing
our part, being good people

17:43.137 --> 17:45.212
and getting a box
of ugly produce every week.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.290
-I love it.
-Yeah... yeah.

17:47.383 --> 17:48.749
What? What's with the face?

17:48.810 --> 17:50.459
You look like someone peed
in your pickle jar.

17:50.553 --> 17:53.887
It's just... I mean,
all of this was so much work.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.889
And everything smells.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.800
-Including you.
-No!

17:57.893 --> 17:59.911
It's true, Lin.
You do. You both do.

17:59.987 --> 18:01.913
Should we...
never do this again?

18:02.140 --> 18:02.988
LINDA and TEDDY:
Oh, thank God

18:03.141 --> 18:04.140
I was only doing this

18:04.309 --> 18:06.325
because I thought
you really wanted to.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.418
I did.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.420
-But now I really, really don't.
-Yeah.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.756
At least we saved
all these sweet ugly babies

18:11.907 --> 18:13.407
from going to the dumpster.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.151
We're gonna get
into heaven now, right?

18:15.169 --> 18:16.743
-Yeah.
-I want to go to heaven,

18:16.912 --> 18:17.837
but not like that.

18:17.931 --> 18:18.930
Not like that.

18:19.006 --> 18:21.173
And we all die alone.

18:21.326 --> 18:24.160
And now, I'd like to bring up
eighth graders Tina and Zeke

18:24.162 --> 18:26.178
to give their report
entitled

18:26.331 --> 18:28.013
"I Spy Amazing Alumni."

18:28.166 --> 18:29.273
Oh, God.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.644
Hey, Tina, when you look back
at 75 years of Wagstaff...

18:33.871 --> 18:35.187
-What do I see?
-Okay...

18:35.281 --> 18:37.598
I Spy Amazing Alumni!

18:37.733 --> 18:39.283
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.267
-Oh, no.
-Uh-oh.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.602
Let's talk about those

18:41.679 --> 18:44.013
amazing alu... (coughs)

18:44.015 --> 18:45.272
Sorry. Little phlegm.

18:45.366 --> 18:47.183
Um, anyway, ever heard of

18:47.201 --> 18:49.018
Mary Queen of Skorts?
Oh, wait.

18:49.187 --> 18:50.962
-That was your part, Zeke.
-Um... Uh...

18:51.189 --> 18:52.964
Oh, now it's me.
(clears throat thickly)

18:53.191 --> 18:55.282
She's skort of a big...

18:55.301 --> 18:56.192
deal.

18:56.285 --> 18:57.877
-Oh, boy.
-(sighs) I'm sorry.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.137
I'm sorry, everyone.

18:59.288 --> 19:00.805
I'm not great
at oral reports,

19:00.882 --> 19:01.973
and when I have a partner,

19:02.200 --> 19:03.532
that makes me
even more nervous.

19:03.626 --> 19:04.717
I sweat like crazy.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.718
And I get weird phlegm
in my mouth.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.978
(hacks)

19:07.205 --> 19:08.629
It's like a spit smoothie
in there.

19:08.706 --> 19:10.373
And I'm extra nervous because
I don't have the crystal.

19:10.466 --> 19:12.057
That's a whole other thing.
I had a crystal.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.710
It might have had magic powers.
I don't know.

19:14.803 --> 19:15.820
Uh...

19:15.971 --> 19:17.304
-Are we still doing our report?
-Anyway,

19:17.398 --> 19:19.157
maybe I should just accept
that I get nervous.

19:19.384 --> 19:20.825
And maybe that's okay.

19:20.902 --> 19:23.052
Uh, I mean, why try not to be
nervous when I definitely am?

19:23.070 --> 19:24.328
I mean,
look at this pit sweat.

19:24.405 --> 19:26.889
Anyone need me to put out
a small fire? (chuckles)

19:26.982 --> 19:28.240
(chuckles)

19:28.317 --> 19:30.484
(exhales) Feels good
to say it all out loud.

19:30.578 --> 19:31.652
So, anyway...

19:31.746 --> 19:33.396
Oops! I'm getting
the "wrap it up" signal.

19:33.398 --> 19:35.506
Or that kid just really wants me
to look at her watch.

19:35.733 --> 19:36.823
Uh... Thank you!

19:37.993 --> 19:41.086
Well, didn't really get to talk
about the Wagstaff alumni

19:41.163 --> 19:43.406
or, uh... just about anything
in our report.

19:43.499 --> 19:44.348
But I tell ya--

19:44.575 --> 19:45.165
it was a pretty nice
little speech.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.409
Good job, partner.

19:46.627 --> 19:48.260
And you made being sweaty
and nervous kind of cool.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.022
Thanks.
I'm gonna go get some water.

19:51.173 --> 19:52.581
-(coughs, clears throat)
-Good idea.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.933
You sound like
phlegm-ageddon, girl!

19:54.085 --> 19:56.252
Next up: Eighth graders
Tammy and Jocelyn

19:56.421 --> 19:57.695
with their report on

19:57.772 --> 19:59.438
-Wagstaff fashions
past and present.
-(phone buzzing)

19:59.590 --> 20:00.514
Sorry. Sorry.

20:00.608 --> 20:01.848
Wait! Where is she going?

20:01.943 --> 20:04.017
She's gonna miss
our speech. (gasps)

20:04.095 --> 20:05.203
-Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
-Now she's never gonna take me

20:05.354 --> 20:07.688
to Paris Skort
Fashion Week with her.

20:07.782 --> 20:09.874
Tina, I liked your speech.

20:10.101 --> 20:11.934
I mean, it was very awkward.

20:12.103 --> 20:13.860
-So awkward...
-Thank you?

20:14.029 --> 20:15.771
And in a way,

20:15.864 --> 20:17.364
your speech gave me
the push I needed

20:17.442 --> 20:20.200
to leave Cassie a long and
very emotional voice mail

20:20.220 --> 20:21.368
about her crystal.

20:21.462 --> 20:22.703
And she just texted me

20:22.797 --> 20:24.613
that she believes crystals
don't really "break."

20:24.632 --> 20:26.873
She says the energy just
"spreads out."

20:26.968 --> 20:28.968
Really? (exhales) Phew!

20:29.044 --> 20:31.454
She's very wise,
like a pretty owl.

20:31.456 --> 20:34.123
And she still wants
to come over for Cassie-role.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.716
-Oh, good.
-Ooh, I should go.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.718
I need to get all the cat hair
off the furniture

20:37.737 --> 20:38.811
before Cassie comes.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.238
Great speech, T.

20:40.465 --> 20:42.131
At one point I think you sprayed
some of your mouth phlegm

20:42.133 --> 20:44.391
onto your armpit sweat.
That was magical.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.078
-Thanks.
-Well, I got about $3.50

20:47.305 --> 20:48.654
of crystal money
in my pocket.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.823
Is that enough to buy me
a new shirt on the way home?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.083
Probably not.

20:52.234 --> 20:53.751
But maybe
a medium frozen yogurt?

20:53.828 --> 20:54.752
-Three spoons?
-Deal.

20:54.979 --> 20:55.753
You can make it two spoons.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.088
I like to use my hands.

20:57.164 --> 20:58.089
-TINA: Nope. Nope.
-LOUISE: Nope. Nope.
