Previously on Legacies.

00:02.001 --> 00:06.304
My name is Hope Mikaelson. I'm a hybrid of three
different creatures. Tri-brid.

00:06.714 --> 00:09.716
We are a school
for the supernatural.

00:09.716 --> 00:11.557
LIZZIE:
Welcome to the Salvatore School.

00:11.557 --> 00:14.139
I'm Josie.
I'm Lizzie.
Sisters.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.060
Lizzie's nemesis Dana

00:16.060 --> 00:18.222
That's the puzzle piece
you need

00:18.222 --> 00:19.763
to crack Lizzie's candy shell.

00:19.763 --> 00:23.015
I'll forgive you if you promise

00:23.015 --> 00:25.567
not to keep secrets.
I promise.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.068
HOPE:Landon was inside

00:28.068 --> 00:30.860
the walls of this school
because of me. He had access to the knife
he stole because of me.

00:30.860 --> 00:33.402
DORIAN:She's a dragon.

00:33.402 --> 00:37.154
To take down a dragon, all you
need is a buttload of courage and a sword.

00:37.154 --> 00:39.156
ALARIC:
This is a death spell.
We don't allow black magic.

00:39.156 --> 00:42.328
It gets inside your heart
and it poisons your mind.

00:42.328 --> 00:45.490
HOPE: Where are they? ALARIC:They're gone.

00:45.490 --> 00:50.533
LANDON:
I lied to protect myself,
but in doing so, I hurt you. For that,
I will be forever sorry.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.785
ALARIC: You know, I opened this
school to protect these kids.

00:52.785 --> 00:54.666
How am I supposed to
protect them

00:54.666 --> 00:56.587
from stuff that's not
supposed to exist?

Ignarious!

02:45.820 --> 02:49.823
Gaulish.

02:49.823 --> 02:52.664
Why does it always have
to be Gaulish?

03:09.546 --> 03:14.129
DORIAN: All right,
gather together.

03:14.129 --> 03:16.680
Chain spells are about
the fluid movement of energy

03:16.680 --> 03:20.133

Mr. Williams.

03:26.437 --> 03:30.600
Sorry I asked.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.811
A disharmonious group
makes for an uneven flow.

03:35.813 --> 03:38.565
Okay...

03:39.526 --> 03:43.198
JOSIE:
Uh

03:43.198 --> 03:45.109
Probably the people
who started a rumble

03:45.109 --> 03:47.031
with the local high school.

03:47.031 --> 03:48.322
"Lizzie Saltzman,
Josie Saltzman."

03:48.322 --> 03:51.744
And baby makes three.

03:51.744 --> 03:53.035
Off you go.

03:53.035 --> 03:54.326
LIZZIE: This makes
no sense, Dad.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.329
Why are we being punished?

03:59.329 --> 04:00.870
Because you started a brawl
at a charity football game

04:00.870 --> 04:03.872
that risked exposing
what we really do here.

04:03.872 --> 04:05.913
LIZZIE: Well,
you weren't mad last night.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.794
I was mad last night.

04:07.794 --> 04:09.045
My undying love for my daughters

04:09.045 --> 04:11.047
just happened to trump my rage.

04:11.047 --> 04:12.508
I volunteered
everyone in the game,

04:12.508 --> 04:14.379
so stop complaining.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.010
You're lucky that
it's just community service

04:16.010 --> 04:17.471
and not actual jail time.

04:17.471 --> 04:18.762
Can I at least offer
a rebuttal in my defense,

04:18.762 --> 04:21.133
if it pleases the court?

04:21.133 --> 04:23.555
First of all, I was provoked.

04:23.555 --> 04:27.227
My response was totally
proportional considering

04:27.227 --> 04:29.889
the levels of abuse
that I was forced to endure.

04:30.059 --> 04:34.232
And secondly...

04:34.232 --> 04:36.984
if anyone should
take the blame, it's Josie.

04:36.984 --> 04:40.276
What?
I'm sorry.

04:40.276 --> 04:41.897
I totally cracked under cross,
but if you had just

04:41.897 --> 04:43.818
let Kaleb catch the ball...

04:43.818 --> 04:45.400
You'd still be in trouble.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.612
But nice job throwing
your sister under the bus. JOSIE:
Thank you, Hope.

04:48.612 --> 04:50.903
ALARIC: Speaking of,
the bus leaves in ten minutes,

04:50.903 --> 04:53.155
and I expect all three of you

04:53.155 --> 04:54.576
to be on it,
working together today,

04:54.576 --> 04:57.197
harmoniously and without drama.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.999
End of debate.
I wasn't even at the game.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.911
Why am I being punished?

05:01.911 --> 05:03.161
You know what you did.

05:03.161 --> 05:05.663
All right, now,
go, all of you.

05:05.663 --> 05:08.705
Come on.

05:13.258 --> 05:14.259
Seriously?

05:14.259 --> 05:15.840
What part of what I said
needs translating?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.631
I want to help you
with research.

05:17.631 --> 05:21.554
Dorian has a master's degree
in library science.I think the adults
have it covered.
That's not fair.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.845
You only play by the grown-up
rules when you don't

or anyone else any further

05:28.768 --> 05:30.850
into this until I figure out
what's going on, okay?

05:30.850 --> 05:35.103
So right now,
I need you to be a kid

they're human.

Hey, Lizzie, you, uh...

10:43.228 --> 10:44.479
Choose your next words
very carefully, Pedro.

11:12.157 --> 11:13.698
Now's not a good time.

11:13.698 --> 11:15.869
When I was brought on,

11:18.081 --> 11:19.582
I was told that
counseling was mandatory

11:19.582 --> 11:21.253
for everyone at school,

11:21.253 --> 11:22.504
by you.

11:22.504 --> 11:24.335

11:24.335 --> 11:26.126

11:28.088 --> 11:29.759
Mm.

11:29.759 --> 11:35.052
Is that the knife
the dragon was chasing? Dorian never misses
his appointments.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.715
Yes.

11:41.136 --> 11:42.307
And if my translations
are correct,

11:42.307 --> 11:44.018
whoever wields it has
the power to save the world.

11:44.018 --> 11:46.890
Or end all life as we know it.

11:47.851 --> 11:49.682
It's hard to say.

11:49.682 --> 11:51.393
Fourth century Gaulish
is tricky.

11:51.393 --> 11:53.104

11:53.104 --> 11:54.685

12:02.691 --> 12:05.282
I've tried explosives,

12:05.282 --> 12:07.364
an acetylene torch,
a circular saw.

12:07.364 --> 12:09.535
I've even run over it

12:09.535 --> 12:10.696
with my truck.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.287
And according to legend,

12:12.287 --> 12:13.738
it's indestructible.

12:13.738 --> 12:15.869
And I'm starting to agree.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.991
So in addition to father,
teacher, mentor,

12:17.991 --> 12:20.743
you've also added

12:20.743 --> 12:21.953
linguist, slayer of

12:21.953 --> 12:23.915
and demolitions expert

12:28.838 --> 12:30.879

LIZZIE: A jerk.

12:30.879 --> 12:34.212
You are a total jerk.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.424

12:37.424 --> 12:38.595

from Mystic Falls High

12:38.595 --> 12:40.006
assaulted me with a milkshake.

12:40.006 --> 12:41.386

12:41.386 --> 12:43.218

12:43.218 --> 12:45.639
But now Hope

12:45.639 --> 12:47.511
and Josie are all

12:47.511 --> 12:48.891
sisters in solidarity.

12:48.891 --> 12:50.643
But as I was walking home,

12:50.643 --> 12:53.605
I did the work
and I dug deep,

12:53.605 --> 12:56.647
and I realized that
this is all his fault.

12:57.437 --> 13:00.729
How is this my fault?

13:01.770 --> 13:05.232
Because if you had
just been at that game instead of running
around with Hope,

13:05.232 --> 13:07.274
then everything
would've gone differently.

13:07.274 --> 13:09.735
And it is not fair

13:09.735 --> 13:11.907
that she gets to know secrets
that your own daughters don't.

13:11.907 --> 13:16.080
She has a point.
Not helping.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.911
I am not going back there.

13:18.911 --> 13:21.743
Okay, that's fine, um...

13:21.743 --> 13:23.955
Why don't you go help
the primary school students

13:23.955 --> 13:26.086
out in the garden.

13:26.086 --> 13:32.250
At least now you know
why I am so screwed up.

13:40.426 --> 13:44.889
Aren't you supposed to help?

13:44.889 --> 13:46.970
Consider this
a life lesson, Pedro.

13:50.222 --> 13:52.354
People disappoint.

13:55.766 --> 13:57.647
That statue just moved.

13:58.188 --> 13:59.358
Good one.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.482
I mean, I deserve to know what's
happening just as much as Hope.

14:04.482 --> 14:08.024
I'm his freaking
daughter.
It's doing it again.

14:11.196 --> 14:15.619
We're being punked, Pedro.

14:15.619 --> 14:18.121
The sixth grade witches
are learning

14:18.121 --> 14:19.572
illusion spells
this semester.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.573
It's... It's...

14:21.573 --> 14:23.955
It's...

14:23.955 --> 14:29.038
Let me guess,
it's right behind me?

14:32.170 --> 14:36.173
Lizzie.

14:38.675 --> 14:41.386
Pedro.

14:41.386 --> 14:43.298
Run!

14:43.298 --> 14:44.218
Get inside, Pedro!

14:47.390 --> 14:51.803
I need you to
give me your hand.

14:55.186 --> 14:59.478
Now find my dad. Go.

15:04.151 --> 15:08.274
Imperium monstrum.

15:11.987 --> 15:16.490
ALARIC: Lizzie?

15:16.490 --> 15:18.361
Oh, my God, Lizzie.

15:18.361 --> 15:20.162
Oh, what happened?

15:22.163 --> 15:24.955
What happened?
Can you...?
She isn't moving.
Why

15:24.955 --> 15:26.576
The statue hurt her.

15:32.370 --> 15:37.504
ALARIC:Tell me what you know
about gargoyles.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.425
Did you say "gargoyles"?

15:39.425 --> 15:40.836
Okay, uh, search
Medieval French folklore.

15:40.836 --> 15:44.008
Look for "The Legend
of the Gargoyle Petrotho."

15:44.008 --> 15:46.380
If I'm right,
I think he's poisoned Lizzie

15:46.380 --> 15:48.261
with some sort of
actual grayscale.

15:48.261 --> 15:50.682
She's paralyzed.
What if it spreads to her heart?

15:50.682 --> 15:52.384
I'm on it.

15:58.478 --> 16:03.141
You have a future
in waste management.

16:03.141 --> 16:05.773
Cleaning up messes
is kind of my thing.

16:05.773 --> 16:07.894
Well, your sister is
kind of a dumpster fire.

16:07.894 --> 16:12.527
Why do you always
pick fights?

16:12.527 --> 16:15.199
We've known each
other a decade

16:15.199 --> 16:16.490
and any time you have
the chance, you poke.

16:16.490 --> 16:20.202
You guys do your
fair share of poking.

16:20.202 --> 16:22.654
Yeah, in retaliation
to your pokes.

16:22.654 --> 16:24.365
And with you spending
so much time with my dad

16:24.365 --> 16:26.957
and keeping
secrets...

16:26.957 --> 16:28.328
We're not keeping secrets.

16:28.328 --> 16:32.791
Oh, yeah? What happened when you
went to go find Landon Kirby?Nothing happened.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.041
Something clearly did happen.

16:34.041 --> 16:35.712
Rafael never showed up
at school,

16:35.712 --> 16:37.213
my dad was rattled, so
why won't you just tell me?

16:37.213 --> 16:39.625
Because there's nothing
to tell. Aah!

16:39.625 --> 16:41.586
Oh, my God.

16:41.586 --> 16:43.548
Aah!

16:43.548 --> 16:45.089
Ow.

16:46.009 --> 16:47.760
Are you okay?
I mean, what do I do?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.882
Help me pull it out.
What?

16:49.882 --> 16:51.763
I can heal myself.
Pull it out.

16:53.134 --> 16:54.015
Ow!

16:58.057 --> 16:59.428
You poked yourself.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.484
Shut up.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.145
GIRL: To the roof
and back in 20 seconds?

17:10.396 --> 17:13.568
Or we double
your money.

17:13.568 --> 17:15.029
You're on. Ten bucks.

17:15.029 --> 17:16.860
We got this. Yes.

17:16.860 --> 17:19.031

Triple or nothing.

18:08.474 --> 18:09.895
Sir, we've already taken
your money twice.

18:11.937 --> 18:13.478
How about a hundred?

Upper class, you're on

18:34.792 --> 18:36.333
Lower class, I want you
to go with Emma

18:36.333 --> 18:38.164
to the Grand Hall, okay?
Everyone, let's go.

18:38.164 --> 18:39.705
You're coming with me.

18:39.705 --> 18:41.336
Okay.
ALARIC: All right, take Lizzie

18:41.336 --> 18:44.418
with you and the kids.
Keep an eye on that infection.I'm gonna try and draw it
away from the school.

18:44.418 --> 18:46.169
How do you know
it will follow you?

18:46.169 --> 18:48.001
Because I think I have
what it wants.

20:05.302 --> 20:09.765

Yeah, I just think that that's
making me a little bit nauseous.

20:12.807 --> 20:16.770
Huh.

20:16.770 --> 20:18.151
Didn't see that coming.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.732
JOSIE:
It's simple math.

20:20.732 --> 20:22.273
MG has the hormones
of a teenager

20:22.273 --> 20:25.115
and the impulse control
of a preschooler.

20:26.696 --> 20:27.777
He also always goes

20:27.777 --> 20:28.948
for the wrong
kinds of girls.

20:28.948 --> 20:30.239
Given my last crush,
I can't judge.

20:30.239 --> 20:33.491
Well, my last crush
was actually Satan incarnate.

20:33.491 --> 20:37.533
That is, I guess,
unless you count...

20:37.533 --> 20:40.876
Who?

20:40.876 --> 20:42.667
Never mind. It really
doesn't matter anymore.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.708
Lizzie has dibs.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.379
Dibs?

20:46.379 --> 20:48.040
On Rafael?
She always calls dibs.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.712
When's it gonna be your turn?

20:50.712 --> 20:52.333
It just is
what it is.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.425
Right, well, that doesn't
really make it right.

20:59.218 --> 21:03.891
Your dad knows
I used black magic.

21:03.891 --> 21:06.593
That's why I'm in trouble.

21:06.593 --> 21:08.264
Don't worry,
I didn't tell him

21:08.264 --> 21:09.975
that you helped me
with the spell.

21:09.975 --> 21:12.307
Thank you.

21:12.307 --> 21:14.558
And Landon and Rafael
took off together.

21:14.558 --> 21:18.311
Landon told me he didn't know
why he stole the knife.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.062
But then he lied
about having it,

21:21.062 --> 21:23.904
so I don't know what to believe.

21:23.904 --> 21:25.946
Then he wrote me
this letter that was...

21:25.946 --> 21:28.447
I don't know, sweet.

21:30.239 --> 21:31.159
Lizzie's... sensitive.

21:34.571 --> 21:38.114
Our mom is going on

21:38.914 --> 21:40.415
these really long
recruitment missions recently.

21:40.415 --> 21:43.117
That's why she's
extra testy.

21:43.117 --> 21:45.249
She just really misses her.

21:45.249 --> 21:47.960
I know the feeling.

21:49.501 --> 21:51.002
I remember how your mom
used to come by the school.

21:54.505 --> 21:58.297
We all used to say
how beautiful she was.

21:58.297 --> 22:01.720
She was.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.551
We really should have sent you
flowers or something.

22:03.551 --> 22:07.093
:
You did.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.764
Your dad signed your names.

22:08.764 --> 22:10.976
It was obvious.

22:10.976 --> 22:12.687
Okay. We definitely deserve
a little bit of poking.

22:16.439 --> 22:18.100
I wonder where the boys are
right now.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.392
There's this spell
that my Aunt Freya taught me.

22:23.644 --> 22:26.446
It's kind of like
a full-immersion video chat.

22:26.446 --> 22:30.279
Okay, but don't we need
something of Landon's to...

22:30.279 --> 22:33.951
Is that the letter?

22:33.951 --> 22:36.202
You can't tell your dad.

22:37.033 --> 22:39.034
They don't teach this at school.

22:40.285 --> 22:42.287
This is the kind of secret
that I can get behind.

22:46.249 --> 22:50.962
:
Well, this is more like it.

22:50.962 --> 22:53.794
Get used to it.

22:55.836 --> 22:57.627
Oh...

23:08.844 --> 23:13.017
Everything cool?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.728
Yeah. It's all good.

23:18.020 --> 23:18.731
:
Hope?

23:36.493 --> 23:40.906
We should get out of here.

23:44.618 --> 23:46.499
Why'd you stop?
This is twin pain.

23:46.499 --> 23:48.661
Something's wrong. I think
Lizzie's in trouble.

24:05.672 --> 24:07.513
Imperium monstrum!

24:21.352 --> 24:26.146
DORIAN: I'm sorry,
I can't let you leave.

24:26.146 --> 24:27.647
No, I need to go home
to see my sister.

24:27.647 --> 24:29.608
Your dad's with your sister.
And I'm under strict orders

24:29.608 --> 24:31.729
to keep you here.
What

24:31.729 --> 24:32.980
And why are you
researching that?

24:42.947 --> 24:47.120
This is tight.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.121
You're hot. Like, mad hot.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.663
Hotter than Lizzie?

24:52.994 --> 24:55.625
Uh... uh...

25:02.380 --> 25:06.633
Tell me the truth.

25:06.633 --> 25:08.214
Are you actually feeling me?

25:08.214 --> 25:10.215
You're a good guy.

25:10.215 --> 25:12.056
Pretty cute. Great hair.

25:12.056 --> 25:14.258
But I'm secretly
in love with

25:14.258 --> 25:15.599
my best friend Sasha's
boyfriend, Connor.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.310
Well, why are we
doing this, then?

25:17.310 --> 25:18.761
To make Connor jealous.

25:18.761 --> 25:20.222
Which, let's be honest,
is totally what you're doing

25:20.222 --> 25:22.223
with Lizzie Saltzman.

25:23.724 --> 25:25.815
So rather than make out with
you, like any other guy would,

25:25.815 --> 25:28.727
I had to ask the honorable

25:28.727 --> 25:30.068
yet supremely
stupid question,

25:30.068 --> 25:31.689
and now, if I keep going,
I'm taking advantage of you.

25:31.689 --> 25:34.651
And my mama didn't
raise me like that.

25:37.483 --> 25:41.576
Forget we made out.

25:41.576 --> 25:43.117
But also remember
I'm a really cool dude,

25:45.118 --> 25:48.621
with super dope football skills,
and I crush it

25:48.621 --> 25:51.833
all day, every day.

25:51.833 --> 25:54.454
Go.

25:56.666 --> 26:00.669
Come on, Raf. Let's go.

26:00.669 --> 26:02.840
Why?

26:02.840 --> 26:04.091
Yo, this is
a perfectly good spot, bro.

26:04.091 --> 26:06.252
We should keep moving.

26:07.793 --> 26:11.716
Mm. Nah.

26:11.716 --> 26:13.177
No, no, I'm not going anywhere

26:13.177 --> 26:14.508
until you tell me what's up.

26:20.182 --> 26:21.723
Lan. Lan.

26:40.275 --> 26:42.526
EMMA :
It's in the hallway.

27:01.879 --> 27:04.251
EMMA :
Everyone, stay very quiet.

27:04.251 --> 27:06.713
Nullum visilaris.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.682
Raf?

28:21.682 --> 28:23.183
Lan.

28:25.515 --> 28:27.686
You okay?

28:27.686 --> 28:28.847
I don't think either of us are.

28:28.847 --> 28:30.729
Better off than him.

28:37.603 --> 28:38.604
JEREMY:
Relax.

28:41.856 --> 28:43.817
Both of you.

28:45.278 --> 28:49.401
I am not here to hurt you.

28:49.401 --> 28:53.203
Who are you?

28:53.203 --> 28:55.075
Your new best friend.

29:00.909 --> 29:02.960
Unbelievable.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.711
I told you to go, not make out
with some other dude.

29:05.462 --> 29:07.963
Kaleb. What are you doing?

29:09.875 --> 29:11.716
What's it look like?

29:11.716 --> 29:14.167
Eating.

29:14.167 --> 29:16.259
: Oh, my bad.
Where's my manners?

29:17.550 --> 29:20.762
We're not supposed to...
Supposed to what?

29:20.762 --> 29:23.424
Supposed to be following
Lizzie around, like she zapped

29:23.424 --> 29:25.725
our asses with some level-ten
sad puppy spell, right?

29:25.725 --> 29:29.848
Come on.
Do your thing.

29:29.848 --> 29:32.229
I said I'm good.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.641
That's a nasty hickey you got.

29:37.483 --> 29:39.274
Go home, find a scarf

29:39.274 --> 29:41.566
and forget
all about today.

29:43.277 --> 29:45.398
Laters, cutie.

29:46.649 --> 29:48.360
Look, we homies, right?

29:50.111 --> 29:52.443
And I ain't
hurting anybody.

29:52.443 --> 29:54.744
So, secret's ours?

29:57.536 --> 29:58.327
Uh, yeah, man.

30:01.699 --> 30:02.870
Yeah, sure.

30:02.870 --> 30:05.792
Vamps before tramps.

30:16.049 --> 30:20.091
Lizzie?

30:20.091 --> 30:21.963
I'll check the library.

30:27.556 --> 30:32.430
ALARIC:
What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.

30:32.430 --> 30:34.471
You scared me.
Dorian was supposed
to keep you away.

30:34.471 --> 30:37.393
He tried. He lost.
But here.

30:37.393 --> 30:40.475
Killing Gargoyles 101. He
thought you could translate it.

30:40.895 --> 30:44.027
Gaulish. Son of a...

30:47.940 --> 30:51.862
So are we are on our own,
or did the Gauls provide

30:51.862 --> 30:54.945
clear instruction?

30:54.945 --> 30:56.446
In a nutshell, it says
hit it hard, repeat as needed.

30:59.868 --> 31:01.369
Is that...?

31:01.369 --> 31:02.950
Yeah.

31:02.950 --> 31:04.951
Listen,
it poisoned Lizzie.

31:04.951 --> 31:06.742
I'm guessing,
to get my attention.

31:06.742 --> 31:08.293
Then it attacked me
and took the knife.

31:08.293 --> 31:09.494
The knife

31:09.494 --> 31:11.045
And you're still breathing?

31:11.045 --> 31:13.297
Oh, I have a theory about that.
Well, save it,

31:13.297 --> 31:14.748
because we had to take down
that containment spell

31:14.748 --> 31:16.249
to get inside the school,

31:16.249 --> 31:17.379
meaning our monster
can get out.

31:17.379 --> 31:18.961
A containment spell?

31:18.961 --> 31:20.381
Lizzie wanted
to make sure whatever

31:20.381 --> 31:21.632
attacked her
didn't escape into the world.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.634
Good girl.

31:23.634 --> 31:25.055
All right, well,
guess we better find it...

31:26.676 --> 31:29.558
...before it
makes the evening news.

31:29.558 --> 31:30.969
So how'd you take the
containment spell down?

31:30.969 --> 31:32.510
JOSIE:
She didn't.

31:32.510 --> 31:34.351
I did.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.432
And I have questions.

31:36.432 --> 31:38.684
Who is that?

31:39.934 --> 31:41.476
A werewolf hunter.

31:43.147 --> 31:45.318
Is that really a thing?

31:45.318 --> 31:47.319
You're new to this.

31:47.319 --> 31:49.361
You probably think
that being supernatural

31:49.361 --> 31:50.982
gives you the upper hand.

31:50.982 --> 31:52.153
It doesn't.
This world is

31:52.153 --> 31:54.324
a scary place
for someone like you,

31:54.324 --> 31:55.985
especially when
you're dumb enough

31:55.985 --> 31:57.656
to use your powers
in public.

31:57.656 --> 31:59.197
So, what, you go around
saving new werewolves or what?

31:59.197 --> 32:02.530
The name's Jeremy.

32:02.530 --> 32:03.830
I've known Alaric
since I was a kid,

32:03.830 --> 32:05.532
and now I work
for him sometimes.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.833
He told me to track you
and make sure

32:07.833 --> 32:09.454
that you stay out of trouble,

32:09.454 --> 32:10.625
which, apparently,
you suck at.

32:10.625 --> 32:13.247
And that note?

32:13.247 --> 32:14.498
That was supposed
to scare you to safety.

32:14.498 --> 32:16.089
Note?

32:26.596 --> 32:31.099
I'm gonna go
grab the shovels.

32:31.099 --> 32:33.720
Once we bury
the body,

32:33.720 --> 32:35.852
I'll bring you both
back to school.

32:37.553 --> 32:38.433
What happened to "no more lies"?

32:42.056 --> 32:43.897
You gave up a lot
coming out here with me.

32:43.897 --> 32:46.018
We were having fun today--
the kind of fun

32:46.018 --> 32:47.980
you haven't let yourself have
since Cassie died.

32:47.980 --> 32:49.861
When I saw the note
and knew it was

32:49.861 --> 32:51.732
all gonna go to
hell, I just...

32:51.732 --> 32:53.363
I just froze. I'm...

32:53.363 --> 32:55.945
I'm sorry, Rafael.

32:56.986 --> 32:58.777
I'm sorry.

32:58.777 --> 33:01.529
You should go with him.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.121
Honestly,

33:06.872 --> 33:08.493
you're probably better off
without me anyway.

33:17.630 --> 33:18.830
I never thanked you for that.

33:24.334 --> 33:28.507
After Cassie...

33:28.507 --> 33:31.509
you were there.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.141
Like, all in.

33:34.141 --> 33:37.012
It might not have seemed
like I appreciated it.

33:39.394 --> 33:41.145
I did.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.058
So let's do
what we got to do here.

33:48.310 --> 33:51.232
Then let's go back to school.

33:51.232 --> 33:53.563
They don't
want me there.

33:53.563 --> 33:55.104

the gargoyle wouldn't kill you?

36:16.659 --> 36:19.290
Gargoyles are protectors.

36:19.290 --> 36:20.621
And folklore tells a
tale of a gargoyle

36:20.621 --> 36:23.083
who once protected
a small settlement in France

36:23.083 --> 36:26.085
whose villagers
revered a powerful relic.

A knife.

36:31.589 --> 36:33.510
Our knife?

36:34.341 --> 36:35.631
As the story goes,
the gargoyle loved

36:35.631 --> 36:38.213
the humans he protected so much,

36:38.213 --> 36:39.674
he vowed never to
harm humanity.

36:39.674 --> 36:41.345
Instead, he chose
to fight evil on their behalf.

36:41.345 --> 36:44.767
Me being the evil one
in this scenario.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.350
Josie, Lizzie...

36:48.350 --> 36:50.021
In its mind, yes.

36:50.021 --> 36:52.222

didn't hurt me before...

36:52.222 --> 36:54.854
...it saw me as the one
who needed protection.

36:54.854 --> 36:58.356
I'm not sure that knowing that
will make them feel any better.

36:59.687 --> 37:02.109

37:17.199 --> 37:18.490
I know I haven't always
listened to you

37:18.490 --> 37:20.701
with that kind of stuff,
but I'm starting to think

37:20.701 --> 37:23.954
that it's actually
pretty good advice, so...

37:23.954 --> 37:26.415
maybe you should take it.
