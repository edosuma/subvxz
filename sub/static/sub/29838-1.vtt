Did you not want me to know you were here?

46:07.458 --> 46:09.250

What, you just happened not to mention
that you were coming here?

46:14.416 --> 46:16.375
That's why you didn't answer
any of my texts?

Oh, she did not just call
that girl a psycho.

this whole thing is about Jeb!

What are you talking about?

47:45.750 --> 47:48.333
I'm talking about your insane need
for attention

from people who don't seem
to give a shit about you.

47:50.833 --> 47:53.125
If Jeb breaks up with you,
you'll just find someone else

Uh... we went sledding and he got wet.

So you're spending time
with my granddaughter

in the kitchen?

and prance through it.

-Prance?
-Yeah, like it's some sort of...

58:00.625 --> 58:04.208
No, but you can just leave your tour bus
and be a part of the real world, huh?

58:06.250 --> 58:09.458
I would appreciate you not taking
my words out of context anymore.

58:09.541 --> 58:11.166
OK, so what is this then?

Today. All of this.

pretty easy for you.

right off your back.

Well, they don't.

58:44.041 --> 58:44.875
You know why?

58:47.500 --> 58:48.875
Because I'm a person,

58:50.041 --> 58:52.958

whatever they want to me.

58:53.958 --> 58:55.875
And I get it, I'm a fantasy or...

58:56.958 --> 58:59.291

somebody's by themself on Christmas?

59:25.833 --> 59:27.541
'Cause they're promoting an album.

59:27.916 --> 59:29.875
Or because they don't have
anywhere else to go.

59:31.083 --> 59:34.000
Or... maybe they don't have
a family to celebrate it with.

Maybe the staying in the hotel part is
just the best option.

I might have left my life
for a couple hours, but not to...

more time with you.

[Tin Foil Woman] See? Didn't I tell you?

1:24:38.333 --> 1:24:40.000
Snow can make a difference!

1:24:40.291 --> 1:24:42.250
Especially on Christmas Eve.

1:24:42.666 --> 1:24:45.833
And sometimes it's not just the eve
of Christmas,

1:24:46.083 --> 1:24:48.416
it's the eve of everything,

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:50.458
of the rest of your life.

1:24:59.416 --> 1:25:02.041
So even if it gets you stranded,

1:25:02.125 --> 1:25:03.750
or stuck in a snowbank,

1:25:03.833 --> 1:25:05.708
or makes you fall on your ass,

1:25:06.333 --> 1:25:09.875
sometimes, you just gotta let it snow.

[Tin Foil Woman singing] Girl,
something here is different

1:32:21.458 --> 1:32:24.125

1:32:24.208 --> 1:32:27.125
[speaking] That is such a good song!
