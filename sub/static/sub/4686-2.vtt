WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:02.982
So how does it work
with gay marriage,

00:03.004 --> 00:05.567
you take his last name
or does he take yours,

00:05.589 --> 00:07.213
or ***?

00:07.235 --> 00:11.510
Right now, I'm honestly just
excited that Kurt said yes.

00:11.521 --> 00:13.089
Hey, are you looking
forward to prom?

00:13.123 --> 00:14.323
I fell asleep last night

00:14.358 --> 00:16.292
while Tina was texting me
about her prom dress.

00:16.326 --> 00:17.360
(sighs) It's really nice

00:17.394 --> 00:18.728
that you're going
with her, by the way.

00:18.762 --> 00:20.196
Yeah, I guess so.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.198
I don't know, I just...
you know, it's my senior prom,

00:22.219 --> 00:24.066
so I kind of wish
I was going with somebody

00:24.101 --> 00:25.134
I really care about.

00:26.336 --> 00:28.371
Damn, I have seriously
been unlucky in love.

00:28.405 --> 00:30.206
Come on, guys,
we're back with the Beatles!

00:30.240 --> 00:32.208
(students whooping)

00:32.241 --> 00:33.976
We're leaving
the mop-tops behind

00:34.011 --> 00:36.045
and moving into
their experimental years.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.347
Now, the <i>Rubber Soul</i> album
marked a turning point

00:38.382 --> 00:41.083
for the group, where they
literally and figuratively

00:41.118 --> 00:42.485
let their hair down.
Now, the Beatles

00:42.519 --> 00:44.487
were the biggest
musical act in the world.

00:44.521 --> 00:46.055
They could have remained
in their comfort zones,

00:46.089 --> 00:48.391
but instead,
they risked everything

00:48.425 --> 00:50.326
to explore new musical worlds.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.228
They had something
important to say,

00:52.262 --> 00:54.296
and they weren't going to let
something as silly as

00:54.331 --> 00:55.931
the fear of failure
get in their way.

00:55.966 --> 00:57.767
SUE (over P.A.):
Good afternoon, McKinley High.

00:57.801 --> 00:59.168
This year, the proms

00:59.202 --> 01:02.038
are being fused into
one giant Brundleprom.

01:02.072 --> 01:03.873
What's a Brundleprom?
I don't get that reference.

01:03.907 --> 01:04.774
That's from <i>The Fly.</i>

01:04.808 --> 01:06.275
SUE:
And now for the moment

01:06.309 --> 01:08.844
that will crush 99%
of your misguided views

01:08.879 --> 01:10.780
about your own popularity.

01:10.814 --> 01:12.882
Here are your nominees

01:12.916 --> 01:15.551
for Prom King and Queen.

01:15.585 --> 01:18.220
First, here are your nominees
for Prom King:

01:18.255 --> 01:19.255
Blaine Anderson...

01:19.289 --> 01:20.856
hooping)

01:20.891 --> 01:22.358
...Mohamed Omar,

01:22.392 --> 01:23.292
Artie Abrams...

01:23.326 --> 01:25.695
Yeah!

01:25.729 --> 01:27.930
... "Stoner"  Brett Bukowski.

01:27.964 --> 01:30.299
Wait, I-I really didn't get
nominated for king?

01:30.333 --> 01:31.400
And now onto the Queen.

01:31.435 --> 01:32.935
TINA:
<i>Please let it be me God,</i>

01:32.969 --> 01:34.236
<i>please let it be me Yahweh,</i>

01:34.271 --> 01:35.237
<i>please let it be me.</i>

01:35.272 --> 01:36.105
Kitty Wilde...

01:36.139 --> 01:37.940
But I'm a sophomore.

01:37.974 --> 01:39.575
...Aimee Ryan...

01:39.609 --> 01:40.576
(whooping)

01:40.610 --> 01:41.577
...Jordan Stern.

01:41.611 --> 01:42.812
And, inexplicably,

01:42.846 --> 01:44.280
Tina Cohen-Chang.

01:44.314 --> 01:45.781
Yes! Yes!

01:45.816 --> 01:47.550
Congratulations.
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God, yes!

01:47.584 --> 01:49.618
Six of you will be disappointed.
Yes! Yeah!

01:49.653 --> 01:51.787
Yeah! Yes!
Tina. Wow!

01:51.822 --> 01:53.742
Even though I'm not nominated,
it's such an honor

01:53.757 --> 01:55.091
to be going to prom
with a potential queen.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.492
Oh...

01:56.526 --> 01:57.493
Sorry, Sam.

01:57.527 --> 01:58.727
It was so nice of you to offer

01:58.729 --> 02:00.029
to go with me,
but I'm going to have

02:00.063 --> 02:01.097
to decline your invitation.

02:01.131 --> 02:03.399
But you already accepted.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.967
Yeah, Tina, this
is very uncool.

02:05.001 --> 02:06.769
Losing is uncool.

02:06.803 --> 02:09.672
I need to maximize my odds
of taking the crown,

02:09.705 --> 02:11.640
so I think I'm going to go
with a group of single gals

02:11.675 --> 02:13.409
to corner the dejected
wallflower vote.

02:13.443 --> 02:14.810
And I am going for it.

02:14.845 --> 02:16.846
This is my chance
to be bigger than Jesus.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.481
So can I count on
all your votes?

02:19.616 --> 02:21.283
(whispering):
Awkward.

02:21.318 --> 02:22.284
You've got mine.

02:22.319 --> 02:23.786
Besides,

02:23.820 --> 02:25.321
I've got more shots
at Prom Queen.

02:25.355 --> 02:26.522
It's Tina's time.

02:26.556 --> 02:28.491
I agree. Hit it!

03:12.536 --> 03:14.503
Okay? And-and-and
the thing is,

03:14.538 --> 03:16.906
is that I wasn't just
auditioning for this for myself.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.574
I was auditioning
for everyone at McKinley.

03:18.608 --> 03:21.143

03:22.345 --> 03:24.647
Okay, well, one of us
sort of already did.

03:24.681 --> 03:25.848
I booked a commercial.

03:25.882 --> 03:27.550
It's a little embarrassing,

03:27.584 --> 03:29.618
because it was for that
yeast infection medication,

03:29.653 --> 03:30.820
Yeast-I-Stat.

03:30.854 --> 03:32.588

03:41.131 --> 03:42.264
There are good kinds of yeast,

03:42.299 --> 03:44.400
and bad kinds of yeast.

03:45.602 --> 03:48.337

Thank you.
Thank you.

04:21.605 --> 04:22.605
(laughs)

04:27.611 --> 04:28.911
Oh, hi, Kitty.

04:28.945 --> 04:30.479
Could I talk to you
for a second?

04:30.513 --> 04:32.748
I was so psyched
that a fellow Cheerio!

04:32.782 --> 04:34.016
Was nominated for Prom Queen.

04:34.050 --> 04:35.351
Thanks, Bree.

04:35.385 --> 04:36.352
And then I heard
that you weren't

04:36.386 --> 04:37.519
going to campaign for it,

04:37.554 --> 04:39.355
and instead you were
throwing your support

04:39.389 --> 04:40.823
to that Asian girl
from Glee Club

04:40.857 --> 04:42.458
because you thought
it was "her turn."

04:42.492 --> 04:43.792
Now, if that's true,

04:43.827 --> 04:45.060
you might want to tie
yourself down,

04:45.095 --> 04:46.295
because this is gonna
be a rough ride.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.663
I just wanted to remind you

04:47.697 --> 04:49.932
that a Cheerio!
Has not won Prom Queen

04:49.966 --> 04:51.400
for several years now.

04:51.434 --> 04:53.602
We've had Prom Queens
from Glee Club,

04:53.637 --> 04:56.171
including the Jewish girl
and a gay dude.

04:56.206 --> 04:57.606
And if we're not careful,

04:57.641 --> 04:59.808
I swear to God we're gonna have
a black transsexual

04:59.843 --> 05:01.510
named Unique as Prom Queen

05:01.544 --> 05:03.412
before we have a Cheerio!
As Prom Queen.

05:03.446 --> 05:05.180
Now, I know you're
thinking to yourself:

05:05.215 --> 05:06.515
"But O.M.G., Bree,

05:06.549 --> 05:07.917
I love the Asian girl
from Glee Club."

05:07.951 --> 05:09.991
Well, punch yourself in the face
so I don't have to.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.854
I do not give a flying fart,

05:11.888 --> 05:13.923
and the Cheerios!
Do not give a flying fart,

05:13.957 --> 05:15.858
about how much you love
your sisters from Glee Club.

05:15.892 --> 05:17.927
You have 51 weeks
out of the year

05:17.961 --> 05:19.295
to love your sisters
from Glee Club,

05:19.329 --> 05:20.429
and this week is not...

05:20.463 --> 05:22.131
I repeat, not...
one of them.

05:22.165 --> 05:24.867
This week is about winning
Prom Queen for the Cheerios!,

05:24.901 --> 05:27.303
and that's not gonna happen
if you're off campaigning

05:27.337 --> 05:29.438
for Kimchi Cohen-Barf
or whoever.

05:29.472 --> 05:31.273
Are you an idiot, Kitty?

05:31.308 --> 05:32.641
That's not
a rhetorical question.

05:32.676 --> 05:34.343
I literally want you to tell me
if you're mentally slow,

05:34.377 --> 05:35.644
so I can be sure
you're not nominated

05:35.679 --> 05:37.179
for future prom courts.

05:44.688 --> 05:47.022
Sam. I didn't know
you were gonna be in here.

05:47.057 --> 05:48.223
Oh. Hey, Mr. Shue.

05:48.258 --> 05:49.558
(chuckles) Yeah.

05:49.592 --> 05:51.593
You know, a lot of people
say the Beatles were the,

05:51.628 --> 05:52.728
like, the best
band ever, right?

05:52.762 --> 05:53.729
That's right.

05:53.763 --> 05:55.197
Well, what if I told you that

05:55.231 --> 05:56.198
the Beatles wrote
exactly zero songs

05:56.232 --> 05:57.533
about what it feels like

05:57.567 --> 05:59.668
when you tell a girl
that you don't think is hot

05:59.703 --> 06:00.903
you'll go to prom with her
because you feel bad,

06:00.937 --> 06:02.237
and then you think you're gonna

06:02.272 --> 06:03.539
get nominated for Prom King
and then you don't,

06:03.573 --> 06:04.606
and the not-hot girl says,
"I don't want to go

06:04.641 --> 06:05.975
to prom with you anymore."

06:06.009 --> 06:08.089
Would you still say they were
the greatest band ever?

06:08.111 --> 06:08.911
SUE:
Hey there, Buttchin.

06:08.945 --> 06:10.879
Ah, Samgelina Jolie.

06:10.914 --> 06:12.181
Oh, I hate to interrupt

06:12.215 --> 06:14.283
the blatantly
homoerotic overtones

06:14.317 --> 06:17.619
of whatever the two of you are
on the verge of crying about,

06:17.654 --> 06:19.355
so I will be brief.

06:19.389 --> 06:20.723
Now, seeing as
how your students

06:20.757 --> 06:22.925
in the glee club come and
go for weeks at a time

06:22.959 --> 06:24.326
with no explanation whatsoever,

06:24.361 --> 06:26.562
I'm sure that it will not
come to you as a surprise

06:26.596 --> 06:28.931
that we have an abysmal
attendance record

06:28.965 --> 06:31.500
at this school due to illness.

06:31.534 --> 06:32.835
Therefore, I am instituting

06:32.869 --> 06:35.771
mandatory vaccinations
at this school,

06:35.805 --> 06:37.406
starting with your
pansexual orgy

06:37.440 --> 06:39.074
of future patient zeroes,
the glee club.

06:39.109 --> 06:41.276
When you say vaccinations,
do you mean shots?

06:41.311 --> 06:42.778
That's right, Imbecile
Homeless Teen Drifter.

06:42.812 --> 06:45.381
And we will begin
with the polio vaccine.

06:45.415 --> 06:46.582
WILL:
Sue, polio was all but

06:46.616 --> 06:48.450
eradicated in the 1950s.

06:48.485 --> 06:50.252
Or so they'd have us believe.

06:50.286 --> 06:53.255
I saw a documentary
last night on FDR,

06:53.289 --> 06:54.590
and it made me very suspicious

06:54.624 --> 06:56.191
about that glee kid
in the wheelchair.

06:56.226 --> 06:58.627
Artie? He was in a car accident
when he was a kid.

06:58.661 --> 07:01.630
Fact: there is a meningitis
outbreak in Los Angeles.

07:01.664 --> 07:03.732
Fact: Mercedes Jones

07:03.767 --> 07:05.701
recently returned
from Los Angeles...

07:05.735 --> 07:07.369
Wait, I cannot
get a vaccination.

07:07.404 --> 07:09.638
Needles totally freak me out.
Sue, I'm all about keeping

07:09.672 --> 07:11.373
the kids in this school healthy,
but this is ridiculous.

07:11.408 --> 07:13.342
Hey, I would watch
your tone with me

07:13.376 --> 07:14.810
if I were you,
Busted Timberfake.

07:14.844 --> 07:16.578
I'm not your coworker anymore.

07:16.613 --> 07:18.113
I'm your boss.

07:18.148 --> 07:19.615
And what I say goes.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.784
And if you and Nipples

07:21.818 --> 07:23.519
the Strippin' Clown
don't get your shots

07:23.553 --> 07:25.687
by the end of the week,
you're fired.

07:25.722 --> 07:26.922
(school bell ringing)

07:26.956 --> 07:29.324
(several pianos
playing different music)

07:35.498 --> 07:37.132
What's going on in here?

07:37.167 --> 07:38.267
Carmen Tibideaux
needed volunteers

07:38.301 --> 07:39.568
for the annual
NYADA piano tuning.

07:39.602 --> 07:42.104
So, did you hear about
Santana's good news?

07:42.138 --> 07:43.605
That she doesn't have
a yeast infection?

07:43.640 --> 07:44.773
I'm really happy for her.

07:44.808 --> 07:46.775
Okay, what's wrong with you?

07:46.810 --> 07:48.677
Because the Rachel I know
would be furious at Santana

07:48.711 --> 07:50.345
for breezing into town

07:50.380 --> 07:52.147
and beating us at
booking the first gig.

07:52.182 --> 07:54.616
You have lost your mojo
obsessing over this part.

07:54.651 --> 07:56.785
We can't let our
feelings of self-worth

07:56.820 --> 07:58.454
be determined by
some part in a play.

07:58.488 --> 08:00.823
That's easy for you to say;
you just got engaged.

08:00.857 --> 08:03.258
True, but I'm not pinning
all my future happiness on it.

08:03.293 --> 08:05.794
I'm telling you, you have
got to get your mojo back.

08:05.829 --> 08:07.930

08:07.964 --> 08:09.331

Oh...
No, no...

10:15.565 --> 10:16.732
(crashing)

10:18.268 --> 10:19.768
- Hello?
- Hey.

10:19.803 --> 10:20.903
- Hi.
- Oh!

10:20.937 --> 10:22.605
Are you here for your
polio/meningitis cocktail?

10:22.639 --> 10:24.640
I wasn't sure if
I should call it

10:24.674 --> 10:27.643
polingitus or meningiolio.

10:27.677 --> 10:29.845
I like the second one;
it sounds like Italian food.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.981
(imitating Marlon Brando): I'm going
to give him a shot he can't refuse.

10:32.015 --> 10:34.049
(laughs)

10:34.084 --> 10:37.386
Anyways, yes, I am
here for my shot.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.721
To be honest,

10:38.755 --> 10:41.023
I'm kind of freaked
out by needles,

10:41.057 --> 10:42.937
and even if I wasn't,
I'd kind of be freaked out

10:42.959 --> 10:44.460
by you with a needle.

10:44.494 --> 10:45.961
I saw you kill that sausage.

10:45.996 --> 10:47.429
Oh, yeah.

10:47.464 --> 10:48.531
Yeah, that, I know.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.432
I had kind of a...
an extended panic attack

10:50.467 --> 10:52.301
during the two weeks we studied
injections last semester.

10:52.335 --> 10:53.836
Wait, are you not a real nurse?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.137
I'm a sophomore in college.

10:55.172 --> 10:56.505
This is kind of an internship

10:56.540 --> 10:58.841
to help me get
into nursing school.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.143
Okay. Ready for our shot?

11:01.178 --> 11:03.479
Is that the same needle
you put in that sausage?

11:03.513 --> 11:05.514
Good eye.

11:05.549 --> 11:07.783
You know what?
I'm-I'm just gonna...

11:07.817 --> 11:10.319
I'm just gonna come
back later, okay?

11:11.788 --> 11:13.489
It was cool meeting you.

11:13.523 --> 11:14.423
(chuckles)

11:16.426 --> 11:17.426
Penny Owen.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.296
Sam Evans.

11:20.330 --> 11:21.397
(school bell ringing)

11:21.431 --> 11:23.265
Here are the latest
prom poll numbers.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.900
And your 3:00 coffee.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.536
I said no caffeine until prom.

11:27.571 --> 11:30.206
I can't afford to look tired
like some sad, anemic dishrag.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.740
(girl gasps) Oh, my God!

11:31.775 --> 11:33.242
What is with these numbers?

11:33.276 --> 11:36.278
There's been a sudden spike
in Kitty's popularity.

11:40.684 --> 11:42.685
TINA:
Kitty?

11:44.554 --> 11:46.222
This is unbelievable!

11:46.256 --> 11:47.523
Unbelievable.

11:47.557 --> 11:49.658
Tina, I didn't put these up.
That's not even me.

11:49.693 --> 11:51.193
That's my head photoshopped

11:51.228 --> 11:52.328
onto Olivia Munn.

11:52.362 --> 11:54.263
Oh, please.
I should've known

11:54.297 --> 11:56.198
that when you weirdly
said you'd support me,

11:56.233 --> 11:57.833
it was just some
classic backstabby,

11:57.867 --> 11:58.968
gaslighty Kitty mind game.

11:59.002 --> 12:00.363
Hey, uh, what's with
these posters?

12:00.370 --> 12:01.837
I thought you were
supporting Tina.

12:01.871 --> 12:03.339
And why is
your head photoshopped

12:03.373 --> 12:07.209
onto Olivia Munn's body
from February 2011?

12:07.244 --> 12:08.344
What? I read <i>Maxim.</i>

12:08.378 --> 12:10.713
Don't worry, Tina.
Come on.

12:13.216 --> 12:15.985
This is Tina's one big chance
to finally get what she wants.

12:18.388 --> 12:20.522
Why does no one believe me?

12:21.558 --> 12:22.825
Oh, right.

12:22.859 --> 12:24.893
The habitual lying.

12:24.928 --> 12:25.995
(grunts)

12:34.571 --> 12:36.538
SANTANA:
I dig your name.

12:36.573 --> 12:38.073
So, do you think
that your parents,

12:38.108 --> 12:40.242
like, knew that you were gonna
grow up to be a lesbian

12:40.277 --> 12:42.111
giving you a boy name?

12:42.145 --> 12:44.380
I'm a not a lesbian.
Oh, uh...

12:44.414 --> 12:46.849
You just wear so much
eyeliner... I don't...

12:46.883 --> 12:48.584
I'm totally kidding.
I love lady parts.

12:48.618 --> 12:50.519
Dani is short for Danielle.

12:50.553 --> 12:52.888
And, no, I don't
think they knew.

12:52.922 --> 12:55.324
My parents are actually
kind of d-bags.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.559
They caught me making out
with a girl in the basement

12:57.594 --> 12:58.594
and all hell broke loose.

12:58.595 --> 13:00.329
I grabbed my guitar,

13:00.363 --> 13:01.597
and never looked back.

13:01.631 --> 13:03.098
What about you?

13:03.133 --> 13:05.401
My parents were pretty cool.

13:05.435 --> 13:06.835
Grandma not so much.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.003
I had a girlfriend.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.371
And she was bi.

13:09.406 --> 13:13.309
Any chance of you guys
getting back together?

13:13.343 --> 13:16.278
I love her, but, um, it's over.

13:16.313 --> 13:18.080
It's probably for the best.

13:18.114 --> 13:20.182
I think you need

13:20.216 --> 13:23.285
a 100% Sapphic goddess.

13:25.755 --> 13:28.590
Um... I think I'm gonna
go get the salt...

13:28.625 --> 13:30.459
the salt sh-shakers.

13:31.428 --> 13:32.961
(silverware rattles) Shakers...

13:35.065 --> 13:37.366
Oh, my, God, I am sensing

13:37.400 --> 13:39.201
some serious energy exchanges
happening over there.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.737
No, no, help me, okay?

13:41.771 --> 13:43.939
(nervous laugh)

13:43.973 --> 13:46.408
I'm getting that stinky
panic sweat under my boobs.

13:46.443 --> 13:49.244
Why? She's cute, she's sweet,
she's gay, ask her out.

13:49.279 --> 13:51.246
Okay, I've never been
with an actual lesbian.

13:51.281 --> 13:52.781
It's been all bisexuals
like Brittany

13:52.816 --> 13:54.083
or college girls trying
to experiment.

13:54.117 --> 13:55.317
You're scared.

13:55.352 --> 13:56.852
I've never seen you
scared before.

13:56.886 --> 13:57.853
It's so cute!

13:57.887 --> 13:59.888
You tell no one of this.
Seriously.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.458
I think that I might like her,
and it is terrifying.

14:02.492 --> 14:03.459
Listen.

14:03.493 --> 14:04.854
She seems like
a really smart girl.

14:04.861 --> 14:06.628
And if she's a smart girl,

14:06.663 --> 14:08.504
then she's not gonna miss out
on an opportunity

14:08.531 --> 14:10.332
to be with someone
as amazing as you.

14:10.367 --> 14:11.433
You're right.
Okay?

14:11.468 --> 14:12.901
She's smart.
Okay, go clean up.

14:12.936 --> 14:13.936
Okay.

14:16.539 --> 14:18.140
Mmm, mm-mm.

14:18.174 --> 14:20.642
Hey, Sam, we're gonna go pick up
our tux rentals.

14:20.677 --> 14:22.644
You coming? Uh, could you
guys grab mine for me?

14:22.679 --> 14:24.146
I need to, uh...

14:24.180 --> 14:25.814
go to the nurse's office...
snake bite.

14:25.849 --> 14:27.950
That looks like a human bite.

14:27.984 --> 14:28.951
From a really big mouth.

14:28.985 --> 14:30.219
You sure you didn't
bite yourself

14:30.253 --> 14:31.453
and pretend it was a snake?

14:31.488 --> 14:32.788
Why would I do that?

14:32.822 --> 14:34.590
Oh, I don't know, maybe...

14:34.624 --> 14:35.858
maybe for the same exact reason
why you left math

14:35.892 --> 14:37.226
to get a Band-Aid
for your hangnail?

14:37.260 --> 14:38.660
She's gonna be
at the prom chaperoning.

14:38.695 --> 14:40.596
You can always just take it
slow and ask her for a dance.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.664
She'll stop liking me, okay?
The key for me is to only spend

14:42.699 --> 14:44.600
a few minutes with a girl
and then get away.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.935
My personality is like
a radioactive asteroid.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.537
Spend too much time with it

14:48.571 --> 14:50.038
and it could kill you.
That's insane.

14:50.073 --> 14:51.807
You have an amazing personality.

14:51.841 --> 14:53.509
You have all of your...
impressions.

14:53.543 --> 14:56.044
And-and all of your...

14:56.079 --> 14:58.080
impressions.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.715
I was thinking of doing
my Denzel impression for her.

14:59.749 --> 15:01.283
(imitating Denzel Washington):
All right, all right.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.885
I'm coming for you
and when I do,

15:02.919 --> 15:04.720
she didn't drink the vodka,
I drank the vodka.

15:04.721 --> 15:07.222
Remember those Titans.
All right, training day.

15:07.257 --> 15:08.524
You better come correct
'cause I'm coming

15:08.558 --> 15:09.658
for you and when I do,

15:09.692 --> 15:11.627
it's your day to train.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.529
Training day is here.
(laughs)

15:13.563 --> 15:14.663
My man, all right.

15:16.599 --> 15:18.901
Embrace the Beatles mantra.

15:18.935 --> 15:20.335
"Charge forth fearlessly."

15:20.370 --> 15:21.737
You may get hurt.

15:21.771 --> 15:23.172
Some girls are worth it.

15:23.206 --> 15:25.774
And I have a feeling
you think she is.

15:25.809 --> 15:27.276
Go get them, Denzel.

18:10.668 --> 18:12.101
Sue fired me for incompetence.

18:12.136 --> 18:13.736
I was giving one
of her Cheerios!

18:13.771 --> 18:16.606
A urine test
and another one a vaccination,

18:16.640 --> 18:18.341

you can guess what happened.

Well, y-you can't leave.

18:23.080 --> 18:23.847
Why?

18:23.881 --> 18:25.415
Because we only

18:25.449 --> 18:26.583
hung out once so far.

18:26.617 --> 18:28.084
And-and it wasn't
for long, but, you know,

18:28.118 --> 18:29.419
I had a great time with you.

18:29.453 --> 18:31.454
And you're, like, almost
totally normal and cool.

18:31.489 --> 18:32.455
Really?

18:32.490 --> 18:34.157
All right.
I want you to give me my shot.

18:34.191 --> 18:35.825
If you can get me
to take this shot,

18:35.860 --> 18:39.262
Sue will have to see how great
of a nurse you are and keep you.

18:39.296 --> 18:42.365
One of these days,
I'm gonna get this right.

18:42.399 --> 18:44.267
Might as well be today.

18:47.805 --> 18:49.472
(gasping)

18:52.743 --> 18:53.743
You can't fire her.

18:53.777 --> 18:55.211
Who?

18:55.246 --> 18:56.746
Nurse Penny.
You can't get rid of her.

18:56.780 --> 18:58.448
I mean, I've been terrified
of needles my entire life.

18:58.482 --> 19:00.016
And she just used her impressive

19:00.050 --> 19:02.051
nursing skills
and nurturing bedside manner

19:02.086 --> 19:04.220
to give me a meningitis shot
in my butt.

19:04.255 --> 19:06.956
I'm sorry, but your mouth
is incredibly distracting.

19:06.991 --> 19:08.958
Please put a pair of
white cotton panties

19:08.993 --> 19:10.360
over your head and cover up

19:10.394 --> 19:12.128
that horizontal
talking moose knuckle.

19:12.162 --> 19:14.163
Just promise me
Penny still has a job here.

19:14.198 --> 19:15.498
Oh...

19:15.533 --> 19:18.167
I believe someone's
got a little crush.

19:18.202 --> 19:19.202
No, I don't. I don't have...

19:19.236 --> 19:20.770
Fine. You've convinced me.

19:20.804 --> 19:24.274
Nurse Bumble McQuirkypoops
will remain at McKinley High.

19:24.308 --> 19:26.276
I could use a new plaything.

19:26.310 --> 19:28.444
You know, yesterday, I
asked her for two aspirin,

19:28.479 --> 19:30.013
and she accidentally
gave me steroids.

19:30.047 --> 19:31.814
(laughs) Which means
I can finally

19:31.849 --> 19:33.383

from Mark McGwire.

19:33.417 --> 19:34.384
(groans)

19:34.418 --> 19:35.818
He always wants to hang out,

19:35.853 --> 19:38.655
and I just want to get
the hell out of his house.

19:38.689 --> 19:41.057

19:41.091 --> 19:42.358

Vote for Tina.

19:47.598 --> 19:48.865
Vote for Tina.
Don't be racist.

19:48.899 --> 19:51.034
If you don't vote for Tina,

19:51.068 --> 19:52.869
you're a racist.

19:52.903 --> 19:54.537

Ooh.

19:54.572 --> 19:55.738

What does that mean? I'm
over my fear of rejection.

20:30.908 --> 20:32.909
And I'm no longer
afraid of failing.

20:32.943 --> 20:35.445
I'm auditioning for everything
I'm remotely right for.

20:35.479 --> 20:37.547
Including but not limited
to the role of Bottom

20:37.581 --> 20:39.515

landlady in <i>The Miracle Worker</i>

20:48.192 --> 20:50.393

sugar caddies to caddy.

20:50.427 --> 20:51.794
See, I thought that
that was something

20:51.829 --> 20:53.396

could do alone.

20:53.430 --> 20:55.498
Okay, no, come on.

Bye, Rachel.

We need to get you out of

31:31.512 --> 31:32.478
those wet clothes
and into something dry.

31:32.513 --> 31:34.747
Just leave me like this!

31:34.782 --> 31:37.417
(sobbing):
I swear, I just thought

31:37.451 --> 31:39.385
for one lousy night of my life,

31:39.420 --> 31:42.055
I could be that girl.

31:42.089 --> 31:43.656
But who am I kidding?

31:43.690 --> 31:44.690
I'm not that girl,

31:44.725 --> 31:47.093
and I will never be that girl!

31:47.127 --> 31:48.394
Tina, where are you going?

31:48.429 --> 31:51.330
(sobbing):
I'm going home, Sam!

31:51.365 --> 31:53.266
Okay, Tina, stop.

31:55.169 --> 31:56.436
You have two choices,

31:56.470 --> 31:57.937
and whichever one you pick,
we will be supportive.

31:57.971 --> 32:01.374
But we can either
drive you home,

32:01.408 --> 32:04.610
or we can clean you up,

32:04.645 --> 32:08.581
and you can go back out
there and own that prom.

32:08.615 --> 32:10.450
This is your prom, Queen T.

32:10.484 --> 32:14.120
I can't go back in there.

32:14.154 --> 32:16.422
I don't even have a dress
to wear.

32:16.457 --> 32:17.790
You can have mine.

32:17.825 --> 32:18.858
Or mine.

32:18.892 --> 32:20.226
Or mine.

32:20.260 --> 32:22.995
Although it would be
a crime to break this look.

32:23.030 --> 32:24.764
Come on, Tina.
We're all with you.

32:24.798 --> 32:26.933
You want to be that girl?

32:26.967 --> 32:30.136
Then go <i>be</i> that girl.

Oh, get in this office
and sit down!

35:49.782 --> 35:51.350
Ow! Ow!

35:51.384 --> 35:54.019
- Who is this?
- Bree.

35:54.053 --> 35:55.187
This is the girl responsible

35:55.221 --> 35:56.661
for the giant slushee bucket
at prom.

35:56.689 --> 35:59.558
No, I mean, literally,
who is this?

35:59.592 --> 36:00.959
She's in a
Cheerios! uniform,

36:00.994 --> 36:02.461
but I swear
I've never seen her before.

36:02.495 --> 36:03.662
You put me on the team.

36:03.696 --> 36:04.796
Black Cheerio!...

36:04.831 --> 36:06.298
you think I'd remember
a black Cheerio.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.333
It's not like
we get a lot of them.

36:08.368 --> 36:10.802
Sue Sylvester, this girl needs
to be punished.

36:10.837 --> 36:12.771
Now, I'll admit that
when the bucket of goo

36:12.805 --> 36:14.973
hit the Asian girl in the head,
it was hilarious.

36:15.008 --> 36:16.174
Then the bucket itself fell

36:16.209 --> 36:18.210
and hit the stoner
kid in the head,

36:18.244 --> 36:20.212
knocked him
straight to the ground.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.313
Priceless.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.781
Top-notch entertainment.

36:22.815 --> 36:25.183
But that does not change
the fact

36:25.218 --> 36:28.387
that this girl right here
needs to understand

36:28.421 --> 36:31.490
that pulling hilarious,
top-notch pranks

36:31.524 --> 36:32.524
has consequences.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.558
She should be suspended.

36:35.728 --> 36:38.397
Bree...

36:38.431 --> 36:41.600
I'm promoting you
to captain of the Cheerios!

36:41.634 --> 36:43.635
And buying you a Le Car.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.537
ROZ: What?!
What?

36:45.571 --> 36:47.572
Chocolate Cheerio!, oh,

36:47.607 --> 36:49.107
that evil glimmer in your eye

36:49.142 --> 36:50.909
reminds me of a
young Sue Sylvester.

36:50.943 --> 36:54.713
You found a brand-new way
to go after the glee club,

36:54.747 --> 36:56.715
and I want you to keep at it.

36:56.749 --> 36:58.216
ROZ: I thought
you said you wanted

36:58.251 --> 36:59.351
the glee club to win nationals.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.887
I do, but the glee club
needs an enemy.

37:01.921 --> 37:03.855
The only time they
were any good

37:03.890 --> 37:07.059
was when I was hell-bent
on destroying them.

37:07.093 --> 37:09.361
Plus, I once sang onstage
with them in plaid pajamas,

37:09.395 --> 37:12.964
and ever since, I don't think
they find me quite so scary.

37:14.467 --> 37:17.869
I want you to go after the
glee club with all you've got.

37:17.904 --> 37:20.439
I want it to get weird.

37:20.473 --> 37:22.441
I want you to pull
something so psychotic

37:22.475 --> 37:26.545
that they can't help but start
crying when they think about it

37:26.579 --> 37:28.580
in the middle of the
inevitable Journey song

37:28.614 --> 37:30.348
they'll sing to
win at nationals

37:30.383 --> 37:33.051
after deciding on it
at the very last moment.

37:33.086 --> 37:35.454
You got it?

37:40.426 --> 37:42.494
I think I need an agent.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.330
I guess those
contracts I signed

37:45.364 --> 37:48.233
for those commercials said that
I waived my right to residuals

37:48.267 --> 37:51.436
in exchange for a lifetime
supply of Yeast-I-Stat.

37:51.471 --> 37:53.472
(scoffs) Though I don't
know whose toxic vagina

37:53.506 --> 37:55.107
would need that
much of that stuff.

37:55.141 --> 37:56.508
I mean, if you're
producing that much yeast,

37:56.542 --> 37:57.576
you should probably
start a bakery.

37:57.610 --> 37:58.777
(sighs)

37:58.811 --> 38:00.779
Are you ready for me?
(gasps)

38:00.813 --> 38:02.914
Sorry. What is Lady Hummel
doing here?

38:02.949 --> 38:04.449
Working. Vogue.com doesn't pay,

38:04.484 --> 38:07.185
and I need some seed cash
to start my Madonna cover band.

38:07.220 --> 38:08.320
You guys, this is so great.

38:08.354 --> 38:09.794
I feel like I'm on <i>Smash,</i>
season one.

38:09.822 --> 38:11.189
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

38:11.224 --> 38:13.191
because soon you'll be
dumping us to play Fanny Brice.

38:13.226 --> 38:14.926
Oh, no, that ship has sailed.

38:14.961 --> 38:17.195
If I got it,
I would have heard by now.

38:17.230 --> 38:18.031
Rachel, be positive!

38:18.064 --> 38:19.664
I am positive, okay?

38:19.699 --> 38:20.999
My whole life,
I've been looking

38:21.033 --> 38:22.734
to be a part of something
special to feel special,

38:22.768 --> 38:24.436
but the truth is,
is that I <i>am</i> special, okay?

38:24.470 --> 38:26.571
And I don't need producers
to tell me that.

38:26.606 --> 38:28.673
I'm gonna play this part,
and if it's not

38:28.708 --> 38:31.576
in this production,
then that is their loss.

38:31.611 --> 38:33.478
Isn't it amazing
how life seems so easy

38:33.513 --> 38:35.180
when you just don't give a fart?

38:35.214 --> 38:36.314
I mean, look at this.

38:36.349 --> 38:37.749
Hummel is getting married,

38:37.783 --> 38:39.451
Berry is just
full of confidence,

38:39.485 --> 38:41.853
and I finally have a girlfriend

38:41.888 --> 38:44.389
who I don't have to worry about
straying for penis.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.791
Then let's make a pledge:
we stay in this town together

38:46.826 --> 38:47.959
for two years, all right?

38:47.994 --> 38:50.028
For soaring success
or miserable failure.

38:50.062 --> 38:51.363
None of us bail

38:51.397 --> 38:52.877
until then, okay, no matter what.
Okay.

38:52.899 --> 38:54.733
Okay. Pinky swear.

38:54.767 --> 38:55.800
Come on.

38:55.835 --> 38:57.335
Put those long fingernails
in there.

38:57.370 --> 38:58.670

GUNTHER:
Someone in booth 14

39:01.908 --> 39:03.241
is looking for the short one.

39:04.243 --> 39:06.144
Go.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.181
I take this.

39:09.215 --> 39:10.549
Gunther, that's my Yeast-I-St...

39:10.583 --> 39:11.683
What the hell?

39:16.756 --> 39:18.957
Mr. Campion.

39:21.594 --> 39:24.596
Do you have
any whole cakes, Rachel?

39:24.630 --> 39:27.933
Just a whole cake?

39:27.967 --> 39:29.334
Mm-hmm. I'd like one.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.835
Okay.

39:30.870 --> 39:33.305
But I need you to write
something on it for me.

39:33.339 --> 39:34.439
Can you do that?

39:34.473 --> 39:36.141
Yeah.
Good.

39:36.175 --> 39:39.344
I want you to write, mm...

39:39.378 --> 39:43.014
"Congratulations, Rachel Berry.
You are Fanny Brice."

39:45.051 --> 39:47.252
(voice breaks):
Are you serious?

39:48.254 --> 39:49.854
Are you serious?!

39:49.889 --> 39:50.589
Really?!

39:50.623 --> 39:52.090
Oh, my God! Really?!

39:52.124 --> 39:53.792
Thank you so much! Thank you!

39:53.826 --> 39:55.427
I got Fanny!

39:55.461 --> 39:57.629
Oh, my God!
Thank you!

39:57.663 --> 39:58.897
I got it!
What?

39:58.931 --> 40:00.765
I got it!
She got the part?

40:00.800 --> 40:02.734
I got it! I got it!
Whoo! Whoo!

40:02.768 --> 40:04.469
(applause)

40:04.503 --> 40:05.503
(squeals)

40:05.538 --> 40:07.439
Thank you so much!
I got it! Yeah!

40:08.741 --> 40:11.343
I can't wait to take this off!
