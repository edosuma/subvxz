05:55.675 --> 05:58.395
Sixty-eight... sixty-nine...

05:58.435 --> 06:00.155
seventy... seventy-one...

06:00.190 --> 06:01.315
Come on, will you?

06:01.355 --> 06:02.635
Shut up!

06:02.675 --> 06:03.995
You'll make me lose the count.

06:06.035 --> 06:07.275
Seventy-two...

06:13.395 --> 06:14.675
Seventy-three.

06:14.715 --> 06:16.795
Close enough. It's a hundred.

06:16.830 --> 06:17.915
Let's go.

06:19.355 --> 06:21.035
No, wait!

06:51.115 --> 06:53.235
Hey, Alice! Alice, wake up!

06:56.675 --> 06:57.835
Jesus.

07:46.035 --> 07:48.875
And as adults, we must
now prepare for a new life...

07:48.915 --> 07:50.435
outside
this wonderful environment...

07:50.475 --> 07:52.475
known as Springwood High.

07:54.275 --> 07:56.355
So let's blow this pop stand!

08:01.195 --> 08:03.675
Alice! Yvonne!

08:08.875 --> 08:10.475
Girl, what's wrong?
Let's see a smile.

08:10.515 --> 08:12.295
I had kind of a long night.

08:12.330 --> 08:14.040
Dan keeping you up again?

08:14.075 --> 08:15.475
Girl, you better put a lock
on that window.

08:16.315 --> 08:18.040
The Dan part was nice.

08:18.075 --> 08:19.635
These things are wild.
What do you think?

08:19.675 --> 08:20.875
You look like a nun.

08:20.915 --> 08:22.675
Dying to break her vows.

08:22.715 --> 08:24.475
Find me a man!

08:24.510 --> 08:25.880
Fabulous.

08:25.915 --> 08:27.480
Maybe I should
spell it out for you.

08:27.515 --> 08:29.315
Maybe God's trying to tell you
something.

08:29.355 --> 08:30.635
When are you gonna
run away with me?

08:30.675 --> 08:32.475
Next life. What's that?

08:32.515 --> 08:35.355
My undying love. Have some.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.679
Mark, give it up.
It's hopeless.

08:38.715 --> 08:40.554
I think I'm starting
to wear her down.

08:40.595 --> 08:41.715
Have a taste anyway.

08:41.755 --> 08:45.275
Greta! That's not what
a cover girl puts in her body!

08:45.315 --> 08:46.675
Shit!

08:46.715 --> 08:47.800
She read you.

08:47.835 --> 08:49.835
Ladies,
where's the party tonight?

08:50.235 --> 08:52.440
Why don't we go to Alice's?

08:52.475 --> 08:55.035
No. My dad's got this thing
about drinking in the house.

08:55.070 --> 08:56.155
We gotta do something.

08:56.195 --> 08:59.435
Guys, I got swimming practice
until six-thirty.

08:59.475 --> 09:00.555
So?

09:00.595 --> 09:04.315
They're gonna give me the key,
so I can lock up after I'm done.

09:04.350 --> 09:06.195
Pool party!

09:07.315 --> 09:08.875
Oh, damn, I gotta work tonight!

09:08.915 --> 09:10.955
Hey, Mark! Picture time!

09:10.995 --> 09:13.675
Come get immortalized...
parents and brats.

09:16.635 --> 09:19.355
Greta! Photo opportunity, dear!

09:20.475 --> 09:21.715
Damn it, they caught me.

09:21.755 --> 09:24.275
I have to go gnash my teeth
for the paparazzi.

09:24.835 --> 09:26.875
You guys go on.
I'll catch up with you later.

09:39.395 --> 09:42.075
-Hey, beautiful.
-Oh, Jesus, don't do that!

09:43.555 --> 09:45.755
Sorry. I got a present for you.

09:47.395 --> 09:48.915
You got the tickets?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.755
Yeah. They're coach seats...

09:50.795 --> 09:52.795
but this plane stops in Paris.

09:52.830 --> 09:54.795
It's gonna be a great summer.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.515
Yeah, I know.

09:57.435 --> 09:59.955
Hey... what's the matter?

09:59.995 --> 10:01.275
Nothing. It's just...

10:02.115 --> 10:04.955
I didn't see my dad
at the ceremony.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.115
Well, he'll show up.

10:07.435 --> 10:08.515
Hey, come on.

10:08.555 --> 10:10.075
What's really wrong?

10:11.075 --> 10:12.995
I had one of those dreams
last night.

10:14.755 --> 10:16.235
About him?

10:16.275 --> 10:18.835
Well, not exactly.

10:18.875 --> 10:22.995
It's that I just felt like
I wasn't in control...

10:23.035 --> 10:25.115
for the first time
since all that.

10:26.675 --> 10:31.195
Look, if you don't dream him up,
he can't hurt you or us.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.315
Remember?

10:32.355 --> 10:33.955
You're right.

10:33.995 --> 10:36.035
There you go. Love you.

10:36.075 --> 10:38.155
-I love you.
-Hey, Danny! Dan!

10:39.715 --> 10:41.395
You look sweet today.

10:41.435 --> 10:42.995
Hello, darling.

10:43.035 --> 10:45.915
Dan, this is Coach Ostrow.
He's interviewing next week.

10:45.955 --> 10:47.395
Finest quarterback in the state.

10:47.435 --> 10:48.600
You know what they say...

10:48.635 --> 10:51.035
this boy
feels the need for speed.

10:51.515 --> 10:52.675
So I've heard.

10:53.275 --> 10:55.795
Dad, could we
get into this later?

10:55.835 --> 10:57.555
Summer's just starting.

10:57.595 --> 11:00.075
Dan, we're talking about
your future here.

11:00.115 --> 11:02.275
Excuse us, dear.

11:02.315 --> 11:04.595
-Listen.
-It's OK, Dan.

11:04.635 --> 11:06.195
We take care of our boys.

11:08.915 --> 11:10.075
Say "cheese. "

11:13.715 --> 11:15.555
'Congratulations, Alice.

11:15.955 --> 11:17.315
'You looked beautiful
up there. "

11:18.155 --> 11:20.115
'I'm so proud of you.

11:20.155 --> 11:21.355
'Gee, thanks, Dad. "

11:21.395 --> 11:22.755
You do look beautiful.

11:24.755 --> 11:26.915
I was afraid you weren't coming.

11:26.955 --> 11:29.315
I watched
from behind the stands.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.835
I didn't want to embarrass you.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.235
'The drunk showed up. "
That kind of thing.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.840
That's in the past.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.515
Unless you've stopped going
to your meetings.

11:36.555 --> 11:38.955
No. A deal's a deal.

11:39.795 --> 11:40.915
Come on.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.275
Where are we going?

11:45.315 --> 11:48.155
Oh... to take a picture.

11:48.195 --> 11:50.115
I don't take good pictures.

12:19.595 --> 12:21.155
Call me
when your shift ends, OK?

12:22.915 --> 12:24.035
Good-bye, sir.

12:25.515 --> 12:28.355
Don't worry.
I'll have her home by August.

12:30.115 --> 12:31.235
Just kidding.

12:31.915 --> 12:33.035
See you later.

12:34.075 --> 12:35.275
Thanks for everything, Dad.

12:35.995 --> 12:37.315
You sure you don't want
a ride to work?

12:37.350 --> 12:39.715
No. It's just across the park.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.835
Have fun tonight.

12:53.395 --> 12:54.635
Oh, sorry!

12:56.715 --> 12:59.875
Freddy's coming for you

12:59.910 --> 13:01.755
Three, four

13:01.795 --> 13:04.835
Better lock your door

13:04.875 --> 13:06.880
Five, six

13:06.915 --> 13:09.915
Grab your crucifix

13:09.955 --> 13:11.795
Seven, eight

13:11.835 --> 13:13.995
Better stay up late

13:42.475 --> 13:44.160
Seven, eight

13:44.195 --> 13:46.515
Better stay awake

13:46.555 --> 13:47.995
Nine, ten

13:48.035 --> 13:50.395
He's back again

14:16.355 --> 14:17.635
Wait!

16:01.075 --> 16:04.195
Let me go! Let me go!

16:08.675 --> 16:11.035
There's nothing to be afraid of.

16:11.075 --> 16:13.315
Just do exactly what I say.

16:26.795 --> 16:27.915
Help me!

16:28.635 --> 16:30.035
Why is this happening again?

16:30.075 --> 16:31.915
Oh, please don't let him
do this!

16:33.555 --> 16:34.795
Don't panic, Amanda.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.915
We have a breech birth here.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.195
It's backward!

16:39.395 --> 16:41.315
We're going to have
to turn it around.

16:41.955 --> 16:43.195
Take a deep breath.

16:44.475 --> 16:46.835
I'm going to need you to push.
Now push!

16:55.515 --> 16:56.795
Holy shit.

16:57.875 --> 16:58.995
What is it?

17:00.835 --> 17:01.955
Careful!

17:02.595 --> 17:06.435
Sister,
this is one of God's creatures.

17:06.474 --> 17:07.994
Take solace in that.

17:08.035 --> 17:09.875
That is no creature of God!

17:11.194 --> 17:12.714
Stop it! Give it to me!

17:13.315 --> 17:14.474
Don't let it get away!

18:07.515 --> 18:08.875
Where are you?

18:15.035 --> 18:18.475
No! Not again!

20:10.875 --> 20:13.995
It's a boy!

20:17.795 --> 20:19.915
You can't come back!

20:24.395 --> 20:25.915
I locked the door on you.

20:30.475 --> 20:32.555
Well, I found the key!

20:37.035 --> 20:40.435
Your birth was a curse
on the whole of humanity.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.875
I will not allow it
to happen again.

20:44.915 --> 20:47.035
You brought me back
to give you life...

20:47.075 --> 20:49.635
but now I must take yours.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.115
We'll see, bitch.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.315
We'll just see.

20:56.195 --> 20:58.315
I must be released
from my earthly prison.

20:58.355 --> 20:59.395
How?

21:00.755 --> 21:02.555
Look for me in the tower.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.155
You'll never find her.

21:25.315 --> 21:26.875
Anne.

21:26.915 --> 21:28.635
Oh, God, I'm glad it's you.

21:28.675 --> 21:29.915
-It was terrible.
-What happened?

21:29.955 --> 21:31.475
I was in the dream...

21:31.515 --> 21:33.995
and I don't know how,
but now he's back.

21:34.795 --> 21:38.155
I thought you were dead.
You're four hours late.

21:38.955 --> 21:40.075
Four hours?

21:42.075 --> 21:45.515
I wish I had a prescription
for whatever it is you're on.

21:45.550 --> 21:46.715
What?

21:46.755 --> 21:49.675
Listen, thanks a lot, Alice,
for nada.

22:01.995 --> 22:03.275
Bombs away!

22:24.195 --> 22:26.155
What'd your dad say about
you and Alice going to Europe?

22:26.955 --> 22:28.195
Nothing, really.
Just screamed a lot...

22:28.235 --> 22:30.795
and tried to convince me
that I'm throwing my life away.

22:30.835 --> 22:32.115
Who's throwing their life away?

22:32.155 --> 22:34.275
Dan, and he's taking Alice
with him.

22:35.075 --> 22:37.295
Pretty good dive, Yvonne.
You've been practicing.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.515
That's right. Two hours a day,
six days a week.

22:39.555 --> 22:41.035
Have another one.
I think you need it.

22:41.075 --> 22:42.155
No. I got a shift
in a couple of hours.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.715
Aren't you going in?

22:43.755 --> 22:47.595
No. My mom's got this asshole
photographer coming over...

22:47.635 --> 22:49.795
and I'm not supposed
to mess up my hair.

22:50.075 --> 22:52.715
Aren't you sick of your mom
trying to run your life?

22:55.435 --> 22:56.775
Don't let 'em.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.115
Sure, no problem.

22:58.155 --> 22:59.240
You know, he's right.

22:59.275 --> 23:01.915
Sometimes I feel like I'm living
with Melicertes.

23:01.955 --> 23:03.475
-Who?
-Melicertes.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.715
He's this ancient guy
I read about, right?

23:05.755 --> 23:07.635
Who, like, killed his kids...

23:07.675 --> 23:10.195
because he didn't like the way
they were running the kingdom.

23:10.235 --> 23:11.835
You're really weird,
you know that?

23:14.275 --> 23:15.675
Screw 'em!

23:15.715 --> 23:17.835
Open the champagne!
Let's have a party!

23:17.870 --> 23:18.955
-All right!
-All right!

23:18.995 --> 23:20.995
That's for Alice and me later.

23:21.635 --> 23:23.195
Sorry.

23:24.235 --> 23:26.275
-Ow, are you OK?
-Oh, my God.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.915
I could have gone all night
without looking at that.

23:29.955 --> 23:32.395
I think it's very strange
how you draw all your comics...

23:32.435 --> 23:34.155
loaded with blood and guts.

23:34.635 --> 23:36.115
That freaks you out.

23:37.035 --> 23:38.595
Yeah,
it's just a little blood, guy.

23:38.635 --> 23:41.275
I know what it is,
you big, dumb jock.

23:43.595 --> 23:45.355
Dan, telephone. Come on.

23:46.315 --> 23:48.395
I'll be right back.
Don't touch this, OK?

23:48.430 --> 23:50.355
OK, we'll guard it
with our lives.

23:52.995 --> 23:55.515
-Dan, it was Krueger.
-What?

23:55.555 --> 23:56.795
It happened while I was awake.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.235
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

23:58.275 --> 23:59.635
Now, wait a second. How could...

23:59.675 --> 24:01.875
He must have dreamt himself up.
I don't know.

24:02.635 --> 24:04.115
Jesus, Dan, I'm scared.

24:04.675 --> 24:06.795
All right. Stay right there.
I'm on my way.

24:06.830 --> 24:08.052
OK, I will.

24:08.087 --> 24:09.275
Just hurry, OK?

24:15.995 --> 24:17.115
Shit.

24:20.195 --> 24:21.755
What happened? Somebody die?

24:23.115 --> 24:24.395
Nah. I got to go.

24:24.435 --> 24:25.555
Alice beckons.

24:25.595 --> 24:28.235
Hey, Romeo,
forgot the secret ingredient.

24:29.715 --> 24:32.915
There he goes,
the fastest man on three legs.

24:42.035 --> 24:44.680
The sounds of Springwood.

24:44.715 --> 24:46.955
It's a beautiful evening
here in downtown Springwood...

24:46.995 --> 24:49.835
and we'll be back
with the music in just a moment.

24:50.515 --> 24:53.395
Right now,
we're open for your calls.

24:55.395 --> 24:58.035
I'm calling about
my wayward ex-son Daniel...

24:58.070 --> 25:00.675
who's been acting
like an ungrateful dickweed...

25:00.715 --> 25:03.595
ever since he was seduced
by that bimbo slut whore Alice!

25:03.635 --> 25:05.155
Mom?

25:05.195 --> 25:06.955
If I were you, lady...

25:06.995 --> 25:09.595
I'd kill the ungrateful piggy.

25:19.795 --> 25:22.315
Put your pedal
to the metal, Dan!

25:43.595 --> 25:45.515
Bad year, Dan!

26:00.635 --> 26:03.075
Better buckle up, dear!

27:16.195 --> 27:18.835
This boy
feels the need for speed.

27:21.795 --> 27:23.195
Gotcha!

27:31.315 --> 27:34.515
Fuel injection!

27:36.715 --> 27:39.315
Power drive!

27:39.355 --> 27:41.795
Fast lane!

27:52.395 --> 27:55.595
Hey, Danny,
better not dream and drive.

28:01.395 --> 28:02.475
Coffee, please?

28:33.715 --> 28:35.755
He just came fucking
flying out of nowhere!

28:35.795 --> 28:37.555
It was some kind
of a frigging jet!

28:37.590 --> 28:39.355
I didn't even see him!

28:49.955 --> 28:51.315
Want to make babies?

29:06.515 --> 29:07.555
You're all right.

29:08.315 --> 29:10.035
It's OK, honey, I'm right here.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.475
Dan's been in an accident.

29:15.515 --> 29:17.435
It was no accident.
It was Krueger.

29:17.475 --> 29:19.555
He used to come in through
my dreams and not anymore.

29:19.595 --> 29:21.235
He found some other way.

29:25.715 --> 29:27.435
I'm sorry.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.715
It was no dream.

29:32.075 --> 29:33.675
Dan's dead.

29:36.915 --> 29:38.515
Not Dan.

29:43.635 --> 29:44.955
Honey.

29:44.995 --> 29:46.155
I'm so sorry.

29:46.195 --> 29:48.635
Daddy, it wasn't an accident.
Krueger killed Dan.

29:48.675 --> 29:51.120
Calm down. Take it easy.
You're in shock.

29:51.155 --> 29:53.875
The police found fragments
of a champagne bottle.

29:53.910 --> 29:56.755
Dan didn't drink. You know that.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.715
I mean, it was probably for me
to celebrate our trip!

29:59.755 --> 30:01.835
We gotta do something!

30:01.875 --> 30:03.755
Dan's already dead.
Don't you see?

30:03.795 --> 30:05.155
It's starting again.

30:05.195 --> 30:08.915
These sorts of outbursts
aren't entirely uncommon.

30:08.955 --> 30:10.755
Many women
have them at the beginning.

30:10.795 --> 30:13.155
Especially if they've suffered
a traumatic shock.

30:15.235 --> 30:18.435
Don't worry, young lady.
You're gonna be fine.

30:18.475 --> 30:19.715
What do you mean?

30:22.515 --> 30:24.355
What's he talking about?

30:29.395 --> 30:30.915
What's wrong with me?

30:32.115 --> 30:33.395
Nothing.

30:36.915 --> 30:38.315
You're just a little pregnant.

30:42.835 --> 30:44.755
The doctor
wants to keep you overnight.

30:46.155 --> 30:48.355
Just for routine observation...

30:49.275 --> 30:51.635
to make sure you're
as comfortable as possible.

30:52.595 --> 30:54.275
You're gonna be fine, honey.

30:54.315 --> 30:56.275
Everything's gonna be OK.

31:45.835 --> 31:46.955
What's your name?

31:47.875 --> 31:49.035
Jacob.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.955
Really?
I've always loved that name.

31:57.395 --> 31:58.955
Shouldn't you be in your room,
Jacob?

32:01.635 --> 32:03.195
It's lonely there.

32:06.275 --> 32:07.355
Well, my name is...

32:07.395 --> 32:09.395
I'm sorry your boyfriend
got killed.

32:11.995 --> 32:13.115
How did you know that?

32:13.715 --> 32:15.760
I could tell you were sad.

32:15.795 --> 32:18.035
I just wanted to see
if you were all right.

32:24.035 --> 32:25.515
Jacob, wait. Don't go.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.595
Greta, dear...

32:55.635 --> 32:58.115
it's time
to get your beauty sleep.

32:59.755 --> 33:02.915
We don't want circles
under those beautiful eyes.

33:11.635 --> 33:13.915
Have you visited that little boy
on my floor?

33:13.955 --> 33:15.075
You know, Jacob?

33:15.835 --> 33:18.435
He has kind of sad eyes.

33:18.475 --> 33:20.395
There aren't
any little boys on your floor.

33:21.235 --> 33:23.675
He must have wandered in
from the children's ward.

33:23.715 --> 33:25.275
I was just wondering
what's wrong with him.

33:25.315 --> 33:26.835
We don't have a children's ward.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.635
He was wearing a hospital robe.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.075
I don't know what to tell you.

33:34.835 --> 33:36.235
Did you call everyone?

33:36.275 --> 33:37.555
Yup. Listen...

33:39.115 --> 33:41.395
let's keep this dream stuff
between you and me, OK?

33:48.195 --> 33:49.795
Amanda Krueger
was part of a religious order...

33:49.835 --> 33:52.195
that ran that asylum
in the 1940s.

33:52.275 --> 33:55.315
She was raped by the lunatics
and had the baby there.

33:56.075 --> 33:58.675
That baby grew up to be
Freddy Krueger...

33:58.715 --> 34:01.075
who murdered
twenty or thirty kids...

34:01.155 --> 34:02.515
right here on Elm Street.

34:03.155 --> 34:04.235
He got caught...

34:04.275 --> 34:07.315
but the courts cut him loose
on a technicality.

34:07.355 --> 34:09.235
So, the parents
of the murdered kids...

34:09.275 --> 34:11.755
got together and killed him.

34:12.915 --> 34:14.074
Torched him.

34:15.635 --> 34:17.875
But that was just the beginning.

34:17.909 --> 34:19.635
He keeps on killing...

34:20.514 --> 34:23.235
but he kills people
in their dreams...

34:23.275 --> 34:24.795
their nightmares.

34:25.875 --> 34:28.114
He uses my dreams
to bring him his victims.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.315
It's my fault that Dan's dead.

34:31.355 --> 34:33.315
Stop saying that.
That's bullshit.

34:34.034 --> 34:35.514
Let's talk about the baby.

34:36.235 --> 34:37.995
Yeah, congratulations.

34:38.675 --> 34:39.875
I guess.

34:39.915 --> 34:41.955
That's not what we're here for.

34:41.995 --> 34:44.235
Look, Dan's parents
were really pushing him hard.

34:44.275 --> 34:46.155
He was bitching about it
last night at the party.

34:46.195 --> 34:47.995
He was under
a lot of pressure. We all are.

34:48.034 --> 34:49.574
Pushy parents
can drive you nuts.

34:49.610 --> 34:51.114
What does that
have to do with it?

34:51.155 --> 34:53.635
When Dan died,
you weren't even asleep.

34:54.195 --> 34:56.835
You even said so. End of story.

35:03.715 --> 35:05.355
He must have found
some other way.

35:08.395 --> 35:09.635
Listen to me!

35:09.675 --> 35:12.235
This isn't some kind of joke!

35:12.275 --> 35:14.595
He gets in
through my dreams somehow...

35:14.635 --> 35:16.035
and I thought
I could control it...

35:16.115 --> 35:17.595
but something's changed...

35:17.635 --> 35:20.215
and I don't know
what he'll do next.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.795
Look, Alice,
we all know you're upset.

35:23.715 --> 35:25.435
The bottom line, Alice...

35:25.475 --> 35:26.875
if anybody's
trying to hurt you...

35:26.915 --> 35:28.275
supernatural or not...

35:28.315 --> 35:30.035
they're going to have
to go through us first.

35:30.070 --> 35:32.115
All of us. Right?

35:35.995 --> 35:37.555
That's what I'm afraid of.

36:01.755 --> 36:03.475
How was the meeting?

36:03.515 --> 36:05.315
-Sobering.
-Very funny.

36:07.995 --> 36:09.955
When did you become
such a smart shopper?

36:11.195 --> 36:14.355
Ever since my little girl
became a mom.

36:17.115 --> 36:18.515
You disappointed in me?

36:22.035 --> 36:23.355
No, I'm not.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.955
I sort of hope it's a boy.

36:31.555 --> 36:34.035
It'd be nice to hear a boy
playing in the house again.

36:37.875 --> 36:40.555
Just don't make a habit of it.

36:45.555 --> 36:46.795
It's true.

36:46.835 --> 36:49.915
People are always mistaking us
for sisters.

36:51.195 --> 36:54.275
Greta certainly has
the perfect body for modeling.

36:54.315 --> 36:56.675
You know,
Eileen Ford is a friend of mine.

36:57.995 --> 36:59.115
I told her about you.

36:59.715 --> 37:01.315
She's very interested.

37:01.355 --> 37:05.555
Greta, you're being offered
the opportunity of a lifetime.

37:05.595 --> 37:08.395
I think you should show
a little gratitude.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.755
One of my friends
died yesterday, Mother.

37:11.835 --> 37:14.475
Do you mind if I take
a few hours off to remember him?

37:15.515 --> 37:17.475
But we're having a party, dear.

37:17.515 --> 37:18.915
I read about him.

37:19.555 --> 37:21.155
Drunk or something, wasn't he?

37:21.195 --> 37:23.475
Oh, he was just a friend
of Greta's.

37:23.515 --> 37:25.315
Not someone special.

37:25.355 --> 37:26.755
Not someone she was seeing.

37:27.515 --> 37:28.835
You understand.

37:31.395 --> 37:33.075
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

37:35.315 --> 37:37.035
Aren't you eating?

37:37.075 --> 37:39.355
I really don't feel up to it.

37:40.115 --> 37:43.195
Really, dear,
you ought to try something.

37:43.235 --> 37:45.395
You're the one
who's always slapping my hand...

37:45.435 --> 37:47.515
about my weight, Mother.

37:47.555 --> 37:49.555
That's why we diet, dear...

37:49.595 --> 37:53.355
so we can eat at social events
and not upset the other guests.

37:53.395 --> 37:54.475
Tell you what.

37:54.515 --> 37:56.755
Why don't I just eat
the whole goddamn tray...

37:56.795 --> 37:59.475
go throw up, and come back
for seconds, all right?

37:59.515 --> 38:01.755
Madam, if I may.

38:06.035 --> 38:07.915
Bon appétit, bitch.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.035
Filet de Barbie.

38:13.635 --> 38:16.075
Nothing but the best for Greta.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.475
Open wide!

38:25.475 --> 38:27.155
Second helping!

38:28.795 --> 38:30.835
Don't talk
with your mouth full, dear!

38:30.875 --> 38:33.515
You are what you eat!

38:43.635 --> 38:45.515
Poor baby.

38:45.555 --> 38:46.675
There.

39:16.795 --> 39:18.360
Dad!

39:18.395 --> 39:20.035
Dad, help!

39:49.395 --> 39:51.395
Honey? How's dinner coming?

39:57.635 --> 40:00.315
I can't believe
this shit is happening.

40:00.350 --> 40:01.755
Just hang in there, Yvonne.

40:02.635 --> 40:05.115
Man, I know Mark
is gonna be wigging out.

40:05.955 --> 40:07.575
We just got to keep tight.

40:07.610 --> 40:09.195
We'll get through, OK?

40:10.555 --> 40:12.475
I know he's back here somewhere,
girls.

40:12.555 --> 40:14.275
I think he's pretty upset.

40:22.875 --> 40:23.955
Mark, you OK?

40:23.995 --> 40:26.315
Fine. Just aces.

40:26.355 --> 40:28.115
I want to talk to you guys
about Greta.

40:28.155 --> 40:30.515
I'm terribly sorry,
but Greta's dead today.

40:30.555 --> 40:33.155
Perhaps we could interest you
in someone else.

40:33.195 --> 40:35.035
Look, it was an accident,
just like Dan's.

40:35.075 --> 40:36.355
No accident.

40:36.395 --> 40:38.235
I tried to warn all of you
about Krueger.

40:38.275 --> 40:39.355
Alice, please.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.755
I thought about that.

40:41.835 --> 40:43.955
She must have fallen asleep
while she was at the table.

40:43.995 --> 40:45.275
This is getting
a little sick, guys.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.360
Too bad.

40:46.395 --> 40:48.555
I don't understand
what's happening.

40:48.595 --> 40:50.875
Krueger has to use my dreams...

40:50.915 --> 40:53.115
but he got to Dan and Greta
while I was awake.

40:53.150 --> 40:54.395
How's he doing it?

40:54.435 --> 40:56.215
Why don't you two
stick to reality?

40:56.250 --> 40:57.995
Why don't you shut up
and let her talk?

40:58.035 --> 41:00.115
Two of us have died
in the past two days.

41:00.155 --> 41:02.635
Does that just strike you
as particularly normal?

41:02.675 --> 41:03.995
I'm not finished.

41:05.635 --> 41:07.875
I loved Greta, a lot.

41:08.635 --> 41:11.320
And if maybe, just maybe...

41:11.355 --> 41:13.755
someone or something
killed her...

41:15.315 --> 41:16.715
I'd like to hear about it.

41:17.595 --> 41:20.035
-I'm not gonna listen to this.
-Then get out!

41:20.075 --> 41:21.475
Come on.

41:21.555 --> 41:23.035
Yvonne, wait a minute.

41:23.070 --> 41:24.915
I'm... sorry.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.955
I'm an asshole, OK?

41:30.755 --> 41:32.915
I know I'm not dealing with this
very well...

41:33.795 --> 41:36.395
but it's not your fault, and...

41:37.315 --> 41:38.635
I'm sorry.

41:41.115 --> 41:42.435
It's OK.

41:44.915 --> 41:46.875
You stick around for a while?

41:46.915 --> 41:48.555
I wish I could, but...

41:50.075 --> 41:51.195
I got a shift tonight.

41:51.235 --> 41:52.875
I got to get going.

41:54.395 --> 41:55.875
I'll stay with you for a while,
if you want.

41:55.915 --> 41:57.315
Bye, you guys.

41:58.715 --> 41:59.875
See you.

42:02.635 --> 42:05.035
Do you think I'm an idiot
for being in love with her?

42:05.115 --> 42:06.515
Nobody thinks that.

42:11.395 --> 42:14.355
I know I didn't stand a chance
in hell, but...

42:14.395 --> 42:16.155
She cared a lot about you.

42:16.955 --> 42:18.475
Maybe it was her mother
who killed her...

42:18.515 --> 42:21.035
with all that
Polly-Perfect shit.

42:22.195 --> 42:23.275
It wasn't her mother.

42:23.315 --> 42:26.155
We have these scumbags
here on "The Hot Seat" tonight.

42:27.195 --> 42:28.795
The Phantom Prowler
wouldn't have been afraid...

42:28.835 --> 42:30.195
to tell her how he felt.

42:30.235 --> 42:32.475
If I only had a tenth
of his guts.

42:32.515 --> 42:33.795
Jesus, he's not even real...

42:33.835 --> 42:36.120
and he's more of a human being
than I am.

42:36.155 --> 42:39.195
This guy isn't one of your
comic book characters, Mark.

42:39.835 --> 42:42.155
He's not the Phantom Prowler.
He's for real.

42:42.835 --> 42:44.715
Tell me more
about this Krueger guy.

42:46.875 --> 42:47.995
You look tired.

42:48.755 --> 42:50.155
Why don't I make some coffee?

42:50.915 --> 42:52.315
There's a lot to tell.

44:10.675 --> 44:12.395
Help!

44:28.155 --> 44:29.515
Mark, take my hand!

44:30.315 --> 44:31.635
Take it!

44:46.315 --> 44:47.835
We got to get out of here.

44:53.195 --> 44:54.315
Mark, come on.

44:59.915 --> 45:01.355
Oh, shit.

45:22.875 --> 45:24.195
You don't look very well.

45:26.075 --> 45:27.235
Are you feeling all right?

45:28.115 --> 45:30.115
Been having bad dreams.

45:33.315 --> 45:34.995
Is this where you live, Jacob?

45:36.995 --> 45:38.755
Just waiting for someone.

45:40.955 --> 45:42.235
It's sad about Greta.

45:43.835 --> 45:45.315
Is that who you're waiting for?

45:47.635 --> 45:50.275
I don't think this is
a very nice place for you to be.

45:51.275 --> 45:52.995
Maybe we should go look
for your mom.

45:53.030 --> 45:54.715
She doesn't want me around.

45:54.755 --> 45:56.835
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

45:56.875 --> 45:59.395
I'll bet she's very worried
about you.

45:59.435 --> 46:00.515
I would be.

46:00.555 --> 46:03.755
No, you're not! You don't even
care about being a mom.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.355
How come you
don't think about me?

46:05.395 --> 46:07.675
-Who said I... What?
-I like you.

46:07.715 --> 46:09.355
I want to stay with you.

46:09.395 --> 46:11.155
How come you don't like me?

46:11.995 --> 46:13.715
Who said I don't like you?

46:15.315 --> 46:17.315
My friend with the funny hand.

46:19.035 --> 46:21.355
Come on, honey.
We're gonna get out of here.

46:21.395 --> 46:23.995
No, I have to go now.
He's calling me.

46:24.035 --> 46:25.155
Jacob, wait!

46:40.595 --> 46:41.755
Holy shit.

46:41.795 --> 46:43.995
He's really real, isn't he?

46:47.915 --> 46:49.035
Are you OK?

46:49.915 --> 46:52.395
He's doing something to my baby.
I know it.

46:52.435 --> 46:53.795
He's trying to hurt Jacob.

46:53.835 --> 46:55.055
Who's Jacob?

46:55.090 --> 46:56.275
My baby.

46:57.035 --> 46:58.675
What, you named him already?

47:03.075 --> 47:04.235
I guess so.

47:06.355 --> 47:07.520
I got to get away from here.

47:07.555 --> 47:09.635
Someplace where Krueger
can't find him.

47:11.635 --> 47:12.755
Slow down.

47:13.315 --> 47:15.395
Now, how you gonna hide
from a guy like that, huh?

47:16.275 --> 47:17.435
Leave the planet?

47:18.275 --> 47:19.355
I don't know.

47:19.395 --> 47:20.515
Look...

47:21.235 --> 47:23.035
if you're worried
about your baby...

47:23.075 --> 47:25.955
call Yvonne and have the doctor
check him out.

47:26.955 --> 47:29.795
I'm gonna go see what else
I can find out about Krueger.

47:33.475 --> 47:35.435
You had me scared on the phone.
What's wrong with the baby?

47:35.475 --> 47:36.995
I think Krueger's
trying to do something to him.

47:37.835 --> 47:39.200
Alice! Honey, no.

47:39.235 --> 47:41.115
I love you, but you're gonna
have to get a hold of yourself.

47:41.155 --> 47:43.075
Mark knows I'm not crazy.

47:43.115 --> 47:44.795
Ask him to show you his hands.

47:45.235 --> 47:47.680
I think you just need
to calm down, OK?

47:47.715 --> 47:50.595
I can't figure out how
he's getting in when I'm awake.

47:51.995 --> 47:53.795
Do unborn babies dream?

47:55.875 --> 47:56.960
They do.

47:56.995 --> 47:58.355
But do us both a favor.

47:59.035 --> 48:00.915
Don't mention any of this
to Dr. Moore.

48:02.795 --> 48:05.195
I can't believe you had me
drag Dr. Moore down here...

48:05.275 --> 48:07.155
on a Sunday morning for this.

48:07.195 --> 48:08.475
I'm sorry, Yvonne.

48:08.515 --> 48:09.795
I thought
it was something serious.

48:10.715 --> 48:12.715
If this isn't serious,
I don't know what is.

48:14.275 --> 48:16.595
Don't dare say a word.
You're gonna get me fired.

48:18.595 --> 48:21.195
Dr. Moore,
do unborn babies dream?

48:23.235 --> 48:24.320
As the fetus develops...

48:24.355 --> 48:26.835
it can spend up to
seventy percent of its day...

48:26.875 --> 48:28.195
in a dream state.

48:29.395 --> 48:30.795
More as it matures.

48:32.195 --> 48:33.315
Will I be able to sense them?

48:34.955 --> 48:36.835
Is that why you're here?

48:36.875 --> 48:38.995
To see if your baby's
having nightmares?

48:40.035 --> 48:42.355
We're here to find out
everything we can, aren't we?

48:43.875 --> 48:45.715
Frankly, I have found
nothing about you...

48:45.755 --> 48:47.755
that would indicate
the necessity of ultrasound...

48:47.795 --> 48:49.235
at this stage
of your pregnancy.

48:50.115 --> 48:52.235
I just want to make sure
my baby's all right.

48:55.315 --> 48:57.115
Well, the heart seems strong.

48:57.915 --> 48:58.835
Let's hear it.

49:04.835 --> 49:06.595
There's your baby.

49:14.675 --> 49:15.795
Get her file.

50:22.995 --> 50:24.875
See any family resemblance?

50:31.635 --> 50:33.275
Feeding time.

50:34.115 --> 50:35.755
Soul food for my boy.

50:37.635 --> 50:38.795
Don't touch him!

50:43.555 --> 50:45.475
What's he doing to my baby?

50:45.555 --> 50:48.075
Please, young lady,
try to keep calm.

50:49.115 --> 50:51.435
Your baby is perfectly healthy.

50:51.475 --> 50:52.915
A little large
for so early on...

50:52.995 --> 50:54.835
but as normal
as I've ever seen.

50:54.875 --> 50:57.035
He's taking their souls,
their spirits...

50:57.075 --> 50:58.715
and making the baby like him.

50:58.750 --> 51:00.355
Look, sweetie, you're tired.

51:01.035 --> 51:02.515
You'll feel much better
after I take you home...

51:02.595 --> 51:05.155
and get some rest, OK?
Come on, let's go.

51:05.190 --> 51:06.315
Come on.

51:24.555 --> 51:26.275
Greta and Dan were there.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.795
Krueger killed them.

51:28.835 --> 51:29.995
Now he was...

51:30.955 --> 51:33.275
feeding them to Jacob.

51:34.995 --> 51:36.395
Alice,
stop and listen to yourself.

51:36.475 --> 51:38.315
Do you know what you sound like?

51:38.355 --> 51:41.600
Completely insane, but I'm not.

51:41.635 --> 51:45.075
And if you're my friend,
you would believe me a little.

51:45.115 --> 51:47.275
I am your friend,
and I'm worried sick about you.

51:47.315 --> 51:49.835
It's time to leave the Twilight
Zone and face reality.

51:49.875 --> 51:51.715
-Krueger is reality.
-So is your baby.

51:51.755 --> 51:53.795
You got more to think about
than yourself.

51:53.830 --> 51:55.355
What do you think I'm doing?

51:58.595 --> 51:59.795
Look...

52:00.875 --> 52:03.075
whether you believe it or not,
Krueger is back.

52:03.115 --> 52:04.235
He's after my baby...

52:04.275 --> 52:08.075
and if I don't try to do
something about it, who will?

52:08.155 --> 52:11.435
All I know is you're not doing
you or your baby any good...

52:11.475 --> 52:12.675
by acting like a crazy woman.

52:12.715 --> 52:14.440
Why don't you take off?

52:14.475 --> 52:16.315
Leave Springwood.
Cool off for a while.

52:16.355 --> 52:18.795
God damn it, you don't run away
from this guy!

52:18.835 --> 52:20.675
He finds you in your dreams!

52:20.715 --> 52:22.995
He found a lot of other people
before he found us.

52:23.835 --> 52:26.715
-You, too?
-He invited me to his house.

52:27.795 --> 52:29.000
Look, we're all tired...

52:29.035 --> 52:31.435
and we haven't had any sleep
since Friday night.

52:31.515 --> 52:32.955
That's the only reason
you're alive.

52:33.035 --> 52:34.715
No, it's not!

52:34.755 --> 52:36.155
Look through this stuff,
will you?

52:36.235 --> 52:37.635
She's not crazy!

52:46.955 --> 52:48.075
You OK?

52:49.355 --> 52:51.155
I know what's happening.

52:52.595 --> 52:55.355
Krueger's using Jacob's dreams.

52:55.395 --> 52:56.715
We gotta stop him.

52:59.795 --> 53:00.915
Well, there is...

53:01.835 --> 53:03.155
one way.

53:05.475 --> 53:07.475
Have you thought about
not having the baby?

53:08.195 --> 53:10.995
I mean, no baby...
no baby's dreams.

53:13.195 --> 53:14.795
No, I can't do that.

53:15.915 --> 53:17.875
I saw him inside of me, growing.

53:19.995 --> 53:22.275
He's part of me and Dan.
I want to keep him.

53:23.595 --> 53:25.515
OK, then we'll find another way.

53:31.155 --> 53:32.275
I've seen her.

53:35.515 --> 53:37.555
Alice, can you come down
a minute?

53:49.315 --> 53:52.355
Mr. Jordan and I wanted to see
how you're feeling.

53:54.115 --> 53:55.835
Well, come sit down.

53:57.355 --> 53:58.875
This really isn't a good time.

53:58.915 --> 54:00.315
Maybe you could come back.

54:00.395 --> 54:04.635
Frankly, we wondered what
you intend to do with your baby.

54:05.675 --> 54:06.875
What I what?

54:11.795 --> 54:15.595
Well, I've thought about it,
and I plan to keep him.

54:19.795 --> 54:21.595
We were concerned
that all this...

54:21.635 --> 54:24.035
might be a little bit too much
for you.

54:24.070 --> 54:26.435
I mean,
being single and everything.

54:27.755 --> 54:30.835
What Mr. Jordan means is that
we're aware of the burden...

54:30.875 --> 54:34.475
that raising a child
would place on you.

54:35.715 --> 54:37.480
We want to help.

54:37.515 --> 54:40.835
We want to adopt it and raise it
as though it were our own.

54:43.875 --> 54:47.155
Look, I appreciate
what you're offering...

54:47.235 --> 54:48.755
but, no.

54:48.795 --> 54:50.195
He's my responsibility.

54:50.275 --> 54:51.515
And ours.

54:52.235 --> 54:53.675
It's our grandchild.

54:53.715 --> 54:55.315
Now, Doris, maybe
this wasn't such a good idea.

54:55.355 --> 54:58.555
Alice, we're worried that
in your present condition...

54:58.595 --> 55:00.475
that you don't have
the ability...

55:00.555 --> 55:03.275
to take care of a child.

55:05.315 --> 55:08.635
What are you talking about,
"my condition"?

55:11.875 --> 55:14.675
We got a call from Dr. Moore.

55:14.715 --> 55:17.075
He said that
Alice was hysterical...

55:17.115 --> 55:20.275
and that she was having
paranoid delusions.

55:20.315 --> 55:22.195
You don't understand.

55:22.275 --> 55:23.675
We know you've been through
a lot...

55:24.955 --> 55:27.635
but there is more at stake here
than just your feelings.

55:27.675 --> 55:30.435
You're not taking my baby.

55:31.515 --> 55:33.195
Well, the courts
might not agree with you.

55:33.235 --> 55:34.555
But I do.

55:34.595 --> 55:36.435
I've heard enough of this crap.

55:36.475 --> 55:37.995
You think you can just
walk into my house...

55:38.035 --> 55:39.435
and threaten my daughter?

55:39.515 --> 55:42.515
Please, we have
a legitimate claim to it.

55:43.715 --> 55:45.595
He's not a thing.

55:45.635 --> 55:47.035
He's part of me...

55:47.075 --> 55:50.115
and I'm not giving him to you
or anyone else!

56:02.635 --> 56:04.075
They think I'm nuts.

56:04.875 --> 56:06.235
That's their problem.

56:06.275 --> 56:07.755
No, it's our problem.

56:07.795 --> 56:09.320
If I don't deal with this...

56:09.355 --> 56:11.035
they really might try
to take Jacob.

56:13.115 --> 56:14.440
You said she committed suicide.

56:14.475 --> 56:17.000
Yeah, that's what
the papers thought.

56:17.035 --> 56:19.275
She spent the rest of her life
in the asylum.

56:19.315 --> 56:21.435
After Krueger's trial,
she flipped out...

56:21.475 --> 56:23.755
and hung herself...
so they thought.

56:23.795 --> 56:24.875
Meaning?

56:24.915 --> 56:26.315
Meaning...

56:26.395 --> 56:27.715
they couldn't prove it.

56:29.075 --> 56:30.195
No body.

56:31.395 --> 56:33.035
But I've seen her grave.

56:33.070 --> 56:34.715
Ah, empty plot.

56:34.755 --> 56:36.875
A memorial stone.

56:37.635 --> 56:39.675
Vacant.
They never put her under.

56:39.715 --> 56:41.115
Cool, huh?

56:42.155 --> 56:43.240
I don't understand.

56:43.275 --> 56:48.395
If she killed herself,
her soul's gonna be in torment.

56:48.430 --> 56:49.675
Where'd you hear that?

56:51.875 --> 56:53.755
Right here, somewhere.

57:00.395 --> 57:03.875
Yeah. "Transmigration...

57:03.915 --> 57:05.915
'Soul of a sinner... "

57:05.955 --> 57:09.195
Yeah. "Trapped
in its earthly resting place. "

57:09.875 --> 57:12.515
In the dream,
she was trying to stop him.

57:12.555 --> 57:14.795
She started to tell me how,
then the door slammed.

57:16.635 --> 57:17.755
He must have done it.

57:18.635 --> 57:21.755
We have to find where she died
to release her soul.

57:22.395 --> 57:24.595
I want you to stay awake
and watch me, OK?

57:24.635 --> 57:25.795
No problem.

57:50.275 --> 57:52.155
Hey, you missed practice.

57:52.195 --> 57:54.875
What happened? You fall in love?

57:54.915 --> 57:56.235
Don't ask.

57:57.195 --> 57:58.635
You don't even want to know.

58:00.315 --> 58:02.075
Pool still open?

58:02.115 --> 58:03.915
I think, if you hurry.

01:00:45.315 --> 01:00:47.555
Let's rock...

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:49.795
and roll!

01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:10.955
Where are you going, piglet?

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:15.195
The party's just starting.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:17.915
I know
exactly what you're up to.

01:01:17.955 --> 01:01:22.955
I thought I was up to Yvonne!

01:01:27.155 --> 01:01:28.355
Why don't you just shut up?

01:01:46.835 --> 01:01:48.400
What happened?

01:01:48.435 --> 01:01:50.995
He's scared to come in
because of Amanda.

01:01:53.995 --> 01:01:56.075
Hey, are you all right?

01:01:56.115 --> 01:01:57.235
Oh, God.

01:01:59.355 --> 01:02:01.195
You're not crazy.

01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:05.515
We have to find Amanda.
She's the key.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.955
Come on. Come on.

01:02:42.395 --> 01:02:43.635
Jesus.

01:04:25.915 --> 01:04:29.395
Mark, help me, please!

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:34.875
Is she delicious, or am I crazy?

01:04:34.915 --> 01:04:36.435
You leave her alone!

01:04:50.475 --> 01:04:54.715
Time to die,
you scar-faced limp-dick!

01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:26.675
Faster than a bastard maniac!

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:32.115
More powerful
than a loco-madman!

01:05:35.675 --> 01:05:38.275
It's... Super Freddy!

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:42.395
Told you comic books
was bad for ya!

01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:33.795
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

01:06:41.155 --> 01:06:42.435
Damn it!

01:06:42.475 --> 01:06:44.495
Nothing in that room
was up to code.

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.515
It's a miracle
they both weren't killed.

01:06:47.315 --> 01:06:50.595
No! He won't hurt me.
He needs me alive.

01:06:50.635 --> 01:06:52.915
Who? What's she talking about?

01:06:52.955 --> 01:06:54.915
No, she's just very upset.

01:06:56.195 --> 01:06:58.515
Maybe both of you
should come down to the station.

01:07:06.035 --> 01:07:07.475
What's going on? Where's Mark?

01:07:08.915 --> 01:07:10.515
Mark fell asleep.

01:07:10.555 --> 01:07:12.715
Krueger got him.

01:07:12.755 --> 01:07:14.155
No! God!

01:07:14.195 --> 01:07:16.755
Hey, come on!
I need you to be strong now!

01:07:16.795 --> 01:07:19.475
Listen, we have to get
to Krueger...

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.395
before he gets to Jacob again.

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.075
How do we stop him?

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:25.035
Through Amanda.

01:07:26.155 --> 01:07:27.955
So... we have to find her?

01:07:29.515 --> 01:07:32.595
Just don't ask me to take
a Jacuzzi with that guy again.

01:07:33.995 --> 01:07:35.075
You know...

01:07:35.115 --> 01:07:38.395
I was in the tower
when he used you to distract me.

01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:41.835
What are we gonna do?

01:07:42.715 --> 01:07:44.035
I want you
to go to the asylum...

01:07:44.075 --> 01:07:46.635
the one I told you about,
where all of this started...

01:07:46.675 --> 01:07:48.315
and find her!

01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:49.995
Alice,
you're coming home with me.

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:51.600
No, Dad,
I've got something to do.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.595
Alice,
you're coming with me right now.

01:07:55.995 --> 01:07:58.795
Find Amanda! And hurry!

01:09:25.154 --> 01:09:26.595
Come on out, Krueger!

01:09:30.755 --> 01:09:32.234
The game's over!

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:50.075
I was stronger than you!

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:54.234
So you picked on Jacob!
You bastard!

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:56.875
You're trying to make him
like you...

01:09:56.915 --> 01:09:59.195
so you can live
through his dreams!

01:10:00.115 --> 01:10:02.315
Well, I won't let you!

01:10:02.355 --> 01:10:04.155
You hear me, Krueger?

01:10:15.555 --> 01:10:18.875
OK, if you won't talk to me...

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.035
maybe you'd like to talk
to Amanda!

01:11:06.235 --> 01:11:08.635
Come on, you fucking coward!

01:12:09.115 --> 01:12:11.315
Good night, asshole!

01:12:33.395 --> 01:12:35.155
I'm your real friend, Jacob.

01:12:35.195 --> 01:12:36.315
Just like a daddy.

01:12:40.955 --> 01:12:43.675
I gotcha! I gotcha!

01:12:43.715 --> 01:12:45.315
Mommy, meet my friend.

01:12:47.955 --> 01:12:50.035
Nice try, Alice.

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.275
Thanks, babe.

01:12:51.315 --> 01:12:53.635
It's my new look. Like it?

01:13:05.595 --> 01:13:08.280
Come downstairs.

01:13:08.315 --> 01:13:10.035
He won't hurt you.
He needs us both.

01:13:10.075 --> 01:13:12.035
I've got you both.

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:16.395
Come on, Jacob.
It's time to go home.

01:13:20.635 --> 01:13:23.515
Jacob, run!

01:13:29.595 --> 01:13:31.755
Come on! Come on!

01:13:31.795 --> 01:13:33.435
Come to Papa!

01:13:38.395 --> 01:13:39.995
It's all right, son.

01:13:43.955 --> 01:13:45.435
Now come with me.

01:13:48.435 --> 01:13:50.195
Jacob, he's not your father!

01:14:02.155 --> 01:14:03.475
Kids.

01:14:03.515 --> 01:14:06.195
Always a disappointment.

01:14:37.435 --> 01:14:38.555
Where is he?

01:14:39.195 --> 01:14:41.315
Inside you... where he hides.

01:14:41.995 --> 01:14:43.555
What do you mean?

01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:45.955
Where he hides out. Inside.

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.115
That's how he found me.

01:14:48.155 --> 01:14:49.115
But how?

01:14:49.195 --> 01:14:52.955
He says it's easy
because he knows you so well.

01:14:58.515 --> 01:14:59.675
All right, Krueger...

01:15:01.115 --> 01:15:03.195
this time it's for keeps!

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:33.155
Come on, Alice...

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.155
now we can really get to know
each other.

01:16:04.035 --> 01:16:05.595
Sister Amanda?

01:16:24.035 --> 01:16:26.115
Thank you.

01:16:52.355 --> 01:16:54.995
Jacob! Alice will not triumph!

01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:58.115
Only you can help her now.

01:17:00.635 --> 01:17:01.875
Hey, leave her!

01:17:04.915 --> 01:17:07.315
Let's go!
I want to learn stuff from you.

01:17:07.995 --> 01:17:10.155
She's no fun anymore.

01:17:10.195 --> 01:17:11.555
Teach me?

01:17:26.595 --> 01:17:27.875
Now, Jacob.

01:17:28.995 --> 01:17:31.715
Unleash the power
he has given you.

01:17:34.595 --> 01:17:36.515
School's out, Krueger.

01:19:24.875 --> 01:19:25.995
Stay back!

01:19:26.915 --> 01:19:28.355
Take your baby and leave!

01:19:38.435 --> 01:19:39.555
Let me out!

01:20:01.475 --> 01:20:02.555
You do good work, Alice.

01:20:02.595 --> 01:20:03.835
So did Dan.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.075
Is he still keeping you up
at night?

01:20:06.115 --> 01:20:07.795
Oh, it's OK.

01:20:10.115 --> 01:20:12.675
He has the rest of his life
to catch up on his sleep.

01:20:14.715 --> 01:20:15.915
Hi, honey.

01:20:18.155 --> 01:20:20.395
Sweet dreams, Jacob Daniel.

01:20:21.715 --> 01:20:23.155
Hey, sugar.

01:20:23.915 --> 01:20:26.035
How's my little grandson, huh?

01:20:27.715 --> 01:20:28.795
Look.

01:20:29.795 --> 01:20:31.040
Hungry?

01:20:31.075 --> 01:20:33.475
Mm-hmm. We all are.

01:20:35.395 --> 01:20:37.035
Hey, sweetie.
