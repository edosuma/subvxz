WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:02.921
Previously...

00:03.000 --> 00:06.561
- Where is the gold?
- The Silkie from the sea.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.444
Are you sure the patrol
caught sight of him here?

00:09.520 --> 00:12.568
Yes, sir. Thought they saw him
swimming out to the islands.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.962
Did you ever fall in love
with anyone else after I left?

00:16.040 --> 00:18.611
No, Sassenach.
I never loved anyone but you.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.486
So good to see you.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.291
Jenny and I,
we grieved over you for years.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.450
It's Young Ian.
He's run off again. Have you seen him?

00:26.520 --> 00:27.521
No.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.170
Since when do you lie to your family?

00:29.240 --> 00:30.924
I'm the only one teaching him
the ways of the world.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.411
Who the hell are you?

00:33.960 --> 00:37.726
Your uncle's been a busy man.
But inciting sedition--

00:37.800 --> 00:39.165
Leave! Now!

00:42.760 --> 00:43.886
Please bring Young Ian home.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.883
I'll take the lad home lo Lallybroch.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.200
Sing me a song

00:51.320 --> 00:54.005
Of a lass that is gone

00:54.320 --> 00:56.926
Say, could that lass

00:57.000 --> 00:58.968
Be I?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.963
Merry of soul

01:02.080 --> 01:05.050
She sailed on a day

01:05.120 --> 01:07.202
Over the sea

01:07.280 --> 01:09.567
To Skye

01:10.400 --> 01:12.971
Billow and breeze

01:13.040 --> 01:15.441
Islands and seas

01:15.520 --> 01:20.082
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.840 --> 01:23.207
All that was good

01:23.280 --> 01:25.248
All that was fair

01:26.000 --> 01:28.082
All that was me

01:28.160 --> 01:30.811
Is gone

01:31.240 --> 01:33.402
Sing me a song

01:33.480 --> 01:36.450
Of a lass that is gone

01:36.520 --> 01:38.409
Say, could that lass

01:38.800 --> 01:40.723
Be I?

01:41.680 --> 01:43.762
Merry of soul

01:43.840 --> 01:46.684
She sailed on a day

01:46.760 --> 01:50.367
Over the sea

01:51.040 --> 01:56.251
To Skye

02:32.640 --> 02:33.641
Here I was,

02:34.560 --> 02:38.485
at the place that had been imprinted
forever in my head and on my heart.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.286
It was home once.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.886
It didn't appear
that anything had changed,

02:45.760 --> 02:48.764
but somehow, nothing felt the same.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.411
Never thought I'd see ye
grace my front step again.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.001
Me neither.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.566
When Ian said ye were still alive,

03:18.640 --> 03:20.768
ye might have
knocked me down with a feather.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.845
I know it must be quite a shock.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.925
But here I am.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.407
Here ye are.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.641
Well, you look well.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.921
How are the children?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.046
Grown now.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.491
Some with bairns of their own.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.169
Ye had me worried half to death.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.485
I dinna mean to worry ye, but--

03:56.560 --> 03:57.721
Better get inside, lad,

03:57.840 --> 03:59.490
before your tongue
gets ye in more trouble.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.286
Jamie, why did ye not just
tell me he was with you?

04:26.360 --> 04:27.805
Your sister was worried sick!

04:27.880 --> 04:29.848
Because if he had,
yet! have brought me back home.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.048
Aye, he'd have brought ye home
where ye belong.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.124
Feeding chickens, when I could be
in the city earning a wage?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.680
So that's what ye were doing?
Earning a wage?

04:37.760 --> 04:39.922
Aye, and I was good at it too!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.566
Fergus said so.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.926
Said I was a natural.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.402
I sold 20 casks of brandy before we
were forced to flee after the fire.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.881
What fire? And why did you have to flee?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.770
You had my son selling liquor
and consorting with criminals?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.881
I told you I would
look out for the boy, and I did.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.926
Then there was a wee fire
at the print shop.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.129
Wee? Ye wouldna be
standing here if it was wee.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.730
There's nothing left then?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.240
So that's why ye're home, tail dragging.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.651
And with a stray.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.731
Just drop back into our lives
after 20 years

05:16.800 --> 05:18.325
as though nothings changed.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.241
Everything was fine in Edinburgh, Janet.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.281
Then an agent of the Crown
started extorting me.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.011
Sent his ruffian after Claire.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.801
Auntie Claire killed him.
Killed him good.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.605
Outside. Now.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.442
And you better be where I can find you
when it's time for your thrashing.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.850
You killed a man in front of my boy?

05:54.920 --> 05:58.686
He wasn't there when it happened.
I had no choice.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.491
The man attacked me.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.043
I was defending myself.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.045
But there's more to it than just--

06:05.120 --> 06:07.771
Well, then, maybe we should
all gather around the fire.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.524
I mean,
if we're to listen to a tall tale.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.126
Ye do not complain
when I send you money every month,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.249
and you know fine well it doesn't come
from printing copies of the Psalms.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.369
Aye, I ken how you make your money,
but that's you, brother.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.528
You could have taught Young Ian
the printing trade,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.170
not how to be a criminal.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.005
I promise ye, I treated him
as if he was my own son.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.161
Aye.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.808
Then ye can punish him as yer own.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.168
Maybe there's another way
he can make it up to ye.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.650
I hate this.
Stinks like the devil's arse.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.529
If Ma hears yer cursing--

06:46.600 --> 06:48.364
No one likes a wee clype, Janet.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.364
You're getting covered with muck.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.204
Well, you're covered with foxtails,
so there.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.970
'Tis no fair. Ye run away,
and ye don't even get yer thrashing.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.451
This is a boy's task.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.010
Matthew should be doing this.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.570
I'd rather get a thrashing.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.042
You've even got muck 'round yer mouth.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.884
It isna muck. It's whiskers.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.166
Whiskers? You?

07:13.240 --> 07:14.480
Aye.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.566
Ye may have been right.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.085
As were you.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.487
I should've sent word,

07:30.040 --> 07:32.850
told ye he was with me, and I didn't.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.287
I'm sorry.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.566
It's only that the lad loves ye so,
Jamie.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.723
He follows ye around like a pup,
hanging on yer every word.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.371
Henry!

07:53.960 --> 07:56.327
Hey! Give it back!

07:57.600 --> 07:58.601
Henry!

07:58.960 --> 08:00.689
Ye wee devils!

08:00.760 --> 08:02.444
That'll be your supper then.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.011
You certainly have a full house.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.808
Hello. I'm Claire.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.201
This is Angus and Anthony.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.443
It's a pleasure to meet both of you
fine young gentlemen.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.001
Go on.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.241
They're Maggie's.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.691
Ye remember holding Maggie
in this very room?

08:25.960 --> 08:26.961
Of course.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.731
You were so certain
she was going to be a boy.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.648
Strange to think she's old enough
to have children of her own now.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.724
Well, that's what happens
when 20 years go by.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.691
I heard we had visitors.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.081
I'm James Murray.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.287
Wee Jamie.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.647
Well, you're certainly
not so "wee" any more.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.530
The last time I saw you,

08:57.640 --> 09:00.325
you were barely tall enough
to see over the top of a washtub.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.202
Claire used to live in Lallybroch
when you were about Matthew's age.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.442
Our Jamie here is now husband to Joan

09:07.520 --> 09:11.161
and father to Henry, Matthew,
Caroline, and new wee Benjamin.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.647
I'll away out and see my uncle then.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.165
He's wet himself.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.601
Can I help?

09:23.360 --> 09:26.603
Dinna want to bewilder
the bairn with a strange face, now.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.368
Young Ian's made enough dole
for a month's supply of fuel.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.405
The lad's paying for his crimes.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.010
Our father would've had ye
over the gate.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.681
Aye,

09:50.080 --> 09:52.082
but a thrashings not
the only way to teach a lesson.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.686
Ye're an authority
on raising bairns now?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.201
No.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.680
No, but I am...

10:04.880 --> 10:09.363
an authority on being a 16-year-old lad
that lives on a farm.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.245
Ye treat him as a child,
but he's a man now.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.689
Ye ought to give him a taste of freedom,

10:15.800 --> 10:17.290
while he still thinks
it's yours to give.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.050
Listen to you,
telling me what I should do.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.171
Ye must ken it's a mortal sin

10:24.240 --> 10:26.641
to take another wife
while the first still walks the earth.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.480
I would never have taken a bride
if I thought Claire was still alive.

10:33.560 --> 10:37.645
Since ye believed her to be dead,
why didn't ye share yer grief with me?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.446
I barely wanted to breathe,
let alone speak of it.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.561
I ken.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.165
But ye must speak of it now.
I need to know what happened.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.047
I was prepared to die
on the battlefield at Culloden.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.206
With me dead,

11:10.360 --> 11:13.409
it would've been dangerous
for Claire to stay, so...

11:17.880 --> 11:21.680
So I arranged for her to hide at an inn.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.241
Gave her money
for safe passage to the Colonies

11:26.200 --> 11:27.486
until things had settled down.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.209
Later, I heard the British went through
the village, killing everyone,

11:35.200 --> 11:36.690
man, woman, and child.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.001
But she got away?

11:41.760 --> 11:42.761
Aye.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.365
She thought I'd died in battle.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.801
So...

11:48.280 --> 11:50.567
she boarded a ship to the Colonies.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.085
I didna ken it at the time.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.170
I sat on these very steps,
watching this very road with Claire

11:57.240 --> 11:58.969
when you were taken by the redcoats.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.524
When you didna come home,
we rode together to find you.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.365
The Claire I kent would never
have stopped looking for you.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.206
We could build a cottage,

12:19.920 --> 12:21.445
on the western edge of the land.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.325
We could make a life here, Claire.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.245
Except that Jenny
can barely stand the sight of me.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.281
Yet, perhaps...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.530
Perhaps we should tell her the truth.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.251
We say ye travelled from another time,

12:37.360 --> 12:38.930
ye may as well convince her
ye're a mermaid.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.611
Murtagh understood.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.205
That was a chance we had to take

12:45.240 --> 12:47.811
with a man that's been out in the world.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.844
Jenny has never left this farm.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.209
We're... always at loggerheads.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.247
She'll be full of questions
we have no answers for.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.243
But if I don't
tell her the truth, then...

13:09.720 --> 13:11.882
there will always be this wall
between us.

13:13.480 --> 13:17.201
Jenny casts a very warm light
on those that she trusts

13:17.280 --> 13:19.965
and a very cold shadow
on those that she doesn't.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.881
Aye.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.721
Sometimes...

13:34.800 --> 13:36.928
I still canna believe ye're truly here.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.290
I went searching for ye...

13:46.360 --> 13:47.361
once.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.484
The day I escaped Ardsmuir.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.160
You escaped?

13:53.760 --> 13:54.761
Aye.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.242
There was a man named Duncan Kerr.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.966
Claimed there was treasure
hidden on an island.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.847
He was fevered.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.726
Kent he was dying.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.605
It was his only chance to tell someone
he thought he could trust.

14:16.080 --> 14:22.247
His last words were that the treasure
was guarded by a buidseach ban.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.405
La Dame Blanche.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.525
A white witch.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.361
My heart...

14:34.400 --> 14:38.121
almost stopped when he said it.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.926
I thought maybe

14:41.960 --> 14:43.121
you'd returned,

14:44.720 --> 14:46.449
that you were out there.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.569
There are hundreds of isles
all down the coast,

14:53.480 --> 14:55.323
but only one where the selchs live.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.371
Silkie Island.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.681
I swam to it.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.050
Out of my mind with cold.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.041
Claire.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.728
Claire!

15:59.880 --> 16:02.690
Of course, I didn't find you there.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.087
I realised it was foolish
to think you'd come back.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.010
If he hadna been dead already,

16:15.760 --> 16:18.331
I would've gone back
and killed Kerr myself

16:20.040 --> 16:21.201
For giving me hope.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.605
And then I noticed it.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.085
The MacKenzie crest.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.766
Etched into stone,
just like Kerr had told me.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.561
That's where I found the treasure.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.610
At least Kerr had been right about that.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.764
The box was full
of ancient coins and gems...

16:57.320 --> 17:02.486
Rubies, emeralds, three large sapphires.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.601
I took one

17:05.280 --> 17:08.602
and gave it to the governor
of the prison.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.920
You were free.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.086
You had the treasure.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.365
Why did you go back to the prison?

17:18.839 --> 17:20.171
Couldna take it with me.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.127
Besides, the prisoners needed me.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.280
I was their leader.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.609
I wasn't on an island.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.651
But I was out there.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.288
Wishing you'd come and find me.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.325
Sounds silly, but...

17:48.160 --> 17:50.208
whenever I would hear birdsong...

17:52.280 --> 17:54.248
I would pretend it was you
talking to me.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.767
Ye ken the...

18:01.840 --> 18:04.127
greylag, yeah, it mates for life?

18:05.480 --> 18:07.084
You kill a grown one,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.890
out hunting, you must wait...

18:13.520 --> 18:16.091
for its mate will come to mourn.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.404
Then ye must kill that one too,

18:22.240 --> 18:25.608
otherwise it will
grieve itself to death...

18:27.720 --> 18:31.327
calling through the skies
for the lost one.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.401
What is it?

19:02.240 --> 19:03.241
Jamie?

19:03.320 --> 19:05.288
Something I've been meaning
to tell ye, Sassenach.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.603
Hasna been easy keeping it from ye.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.966
I was hoping to speak
to Ned Gowan before I told ye,

19:12.560 --> 19:15.245
to see if the law was in our favour.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.642
Ned Gowan is still alive?

19:17.760 --> 19:19.000
It's very complicated.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.766
Ye must listen with all yer heart.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.161
Daddy.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.884
Daddy, who is that woman?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.520
Daddy?

19:34.360 --> 19:35.600
Sassenach witch!

19:35.680 --> 19:36.966
Laoghaire, what the--

19:37.800 --> 19:39.643
Laoghaire, what the hell
are you doing here?

19:40.320 --> 19:42.926
Ye're supposed to be dead!

19:45.120 --> 19:46.121
How?

19:46.880 --> 19:49.121
How could ye do
such a thing to me, Jamie Fraser?

19:49.520 --> 19:52.569
Slip home behind my back?
Put yer prick in that whore?

19:52.640 --> 19:54.290
- Ma, please. We shouldna be here.
- Be still.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.850
I havena done anything to ye.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.161
Daddy! Ma! Stop!

20:02.600 --> 20:03.601
Daddy?

20:07.160 --> 20:08.286
He didna tell ye?

20:09.320 --> 20:11.800
He's my husband now.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.761
Have ye no shame, you adulterous bitch?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.569
Go back to the hell ye came from.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.564
Let me go! Let the English cunt
stand up for herself!

20:20.640 --> 20:21.641
Get yerself downstairs, right now.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.051
Get your hands off me!

20:23.560 --> 20:25.289
- Wait here.
- Can't believe you did this to me!

20:25.360 --> 20:26.441
- That woman!
- Laoghaire!

20:26.520 --> 20:27.965
- With that witch!
- Laoghaire, wait!

20:31.160 --> 20:32.161
Daddy!

20:37.600 --> 20:38.840
Who's that woman?

20:39.840 --> 20:41.569
Why'd she upset Ma so?

20:43.280 --> 20:45.851
Well, that woman is Claire.

20:47.800 --> 20:48.847
My wife.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.444
My... first wife.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.850
I thought she was dead,

21:07.440 --> 21:11.126
but by the grace of God,
she came back to me.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.208
I planned on telling
you and your sister about her,

21:17.400 --> 21:18.890
but I didna get a chance.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.606
What about Ma?

21:22.880 --> 21:23.881
Well...

21:26.520 --> 21:29.205
I tried very hard to be a husband
to her,

21:29.600 --> 21:30.761
but your mother and I...

21:33.760 --> 21:38.641
We didna have a bond
that keeps people together forever.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.528
And ye have that bond
with that other woman?

21:44.920 --> 21:45.921
Aye.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.804
Now, ye'll go away...

21:53.480 --> 21:54.481
forever?

21:55.640 --> 21:56.721
Dinna fash, Joanie.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.170
I love you and yer sister.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.282
I'll always look after ye.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.281
I promise.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.561
Now,

22:10.480 --> 22:13.324
go and find Marsali.
She'll take ye home to yer ma.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.641
Go on.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.321
She needs ye.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.361
Claire.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.125
Will ye let me explain?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.286
It's a little late for that.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.725
I dinna live with her.

22:39.800 --> 22:43.407
She and the girls live at Balriggan.
I didna think they'd come here.

22:46.240 --> 22:49.608
It was a great mistake, the marriage
between Laoghaire and me.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.849
With two children? That's...

22:52.800 --> 22:55.565
Took you quite a long time
to figure that out, didn't it?

22:56.320 --> 22:58.527
The lassies arna mine.
I'm not the father.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.281
Really?

23:00.800 --> 23:02.131
That little girl with...

23:03.080 --> 23:04.127
the red hair?

23:05.520 --> 23:08.888
Well, there are other redheaded men
in Scotland, Claire.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.250
Look, Laoghaire was a widow
with two bairns when I wed her.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.005
It's been less than two years,
and we've lived apart most of that time.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.650
And I suppose
that makes it all right, does it?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.040
It's Laoghaire?

23:26.400 --> 23:29.006
She tried to have me killed!

23:29.080 --> 23:31.890
Ye're the one that told me
to be kind to the lass.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.089
I told you to thank her...

23:39.520 --> 23:40.760
not marry her.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.326
Ye're not going anywhere.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.726
You cannot stop me.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.126
You lied to me.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.845
You told me that you never
fell in love with anyone else.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.925
I didna fall in love.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.969
You told me about your son.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.730
Why couldn't you tell me about this?

24:04.960 --> 24:06.200
Why?

24:06.640 --> 24:07.641
Why?

24:09.800 --> 24:10.801
Why?

24:12.800 --> 24:15.041
Because I am a coward.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.081
That's why.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.366
I couldna tell ye
for fear I would lose ye,

24:24.800 --> 24:26.643
and I couldna bear the thought
of losing you again.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.731
I wanted you so badly
that nothing else mattered.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.441
I would sacrifice honour,
family, life itself to see you,

24:33.520 --> 24:36.126
to lie with you again,
even though you left me.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.247
Left you?

24:46.520 --> 24:47.681
Left you?

24:49.960 --> 24:52.008
You forced me to go back!

24:53.480 --> 24:56.768
I would have died
gladly at Culloden with you.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.362
And now you want to blame me for that?

25:00.440 --> 25:01.771
I dinna blame you for it.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.889
Ye had to go for Brianna's sake.
I canna regret that.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.845
But you blame me for coming back.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.921
No.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.961
Yes.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.481
No.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.521
God, no, I...

25:21.680 --> 25:25.048
Do ye know what ii is to live
20 years without a heart?

25:25.560 --> 25:27.608
To live half a man

25:28.000 --> 25:31.527
and accustom yourself
to exist in the bit that's left?

25:31.600 --> 25:32.601
Do I know?

25:33.600 --> 25:36.683
Do I know how that feels?
Yes, you bastard, I know!

25:36.760 --> 25:37.761
What did you think?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.844
That I went back to Frank
and lived happily ever after?

25:40.920 --> 25:42.331
Sometimes, I hoped ye did.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.365
And sometimes, I could see it.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.811
Him with you, day and night,

25:45.880 --> 25:48.451
lying with ye, taking your body,
holding my bairn!

25:48.520 --> 25:50.682
And God, I could kill ye for it!

25:50.760 --> 25:52.762
Well, I don't have to imagine Laoghaire!

25:52.840 --> 25:53.841
Laoghaire?

25:54.520 --> 25:55.521
Christ!

25:56.120 --> 25:57.804
I dinna care about Laoghaire,
and I never have!

25:57.880 --> 26:00.008
So you would marry a woman
you don't even want

26:00.120 --> 26:01.804
and then just discard her
the second you're done?

26:01.880 --> 26:03.530
No, I'm damned one way or the other.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.365
If I felt anything for her,
I'm a faithless lecher,

26:06.440 --> 26:07.726
and if I didn't, I'm a heartless beast!

26:07.800 --> 26:09.245
Well, you should have told me.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.881
And if I had,

26:10.960 --> 26:13.201
ye would've turned on your heel
and left without a word.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.167
But having seen you again,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.561
I would do far worse
than lie to keep you.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.961
Get off me!

26:29.720 --> 26:32.200
Claire! Claire, no! Claire,

26:32.280 --> 26:34.601
I love you and only you.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.167
Stop it!

26:56.600 --> 26:57.601
Both of ye.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.245
Fighting and ruttin' like wild beasts,

27:01.320 --> 27:03.129
and no caring if the whole house
hears ye!

27:32.960 --> 27:34.246
Would ye like a whiskey?

27:38.040 --> 27:39.644
I suppose I could do with one.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.041
Thank you.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.965
I apologise for...

27:59.360 --> 28:00.646
disturbing the household.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.290
I should be apologisin' to you.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.484
I told Auntie Laoghaire ye were here.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.166
That's why she came.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.726
I didna have it in mind to cause
such a kebbie-lebbie. Truly not.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.806
Well, I suppose one of us
would have found out sooner or later.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.407
Why did you tell her?

28:31.680 --> 28:32.727
Mother told me to.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.411
You told Laoghaire to come?

28:41.800 --> 28:42.881
She's his wife.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.167
I am his wife.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.927
Then Why'd ye no try
to find him after the war?

28:49.240 --> 28:51.891
And Why'd it take ye 20 years
to come back here?

28:52.240 --> 28:54.129
Because I thought he was dead.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.361
In a way, he was.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.166
Took him an age to start living again,

28:58.240 --> 29:01.130
and now you're back no more than a week,
and ye've killed a man,

29:01.200 --> 29:03.601
his print shop's razed to the ground,
and he's on the run from the law.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.051
I suppose that's all my doing?

29:05.120 --> 29:07.407
Well, there's no denying
trouble finds my brother,

29:07.480 --> 29:09.005
but ye didna help matters much.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.811
I wanted to come back
to be part of this family again.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.801
Well, family writes letters.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.968
Telling one another they're alive.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.646
What? Did ye think
we were all just frozen in time

29:21.720 --> 29:23.245
waiting for you to return?

29:23.640 --> 29:24.641
No.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.371
I had another husband in America,

29:31.320 --> 29:33.129
and it was a matter of survival.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.641
Now, it wasn't easy,

29:34.720 --> 29:39.169
but I had to put my past behind me
so that I could make that marriage work.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.046
Does Jamie know?

29:46.760 --> 29:47.761
Yes.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.445
Did ye have any bairns?

29:51.960 --> 29:52.961
No.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.724
I never had children with him.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.646
But when he died,

30:01.680 --> 30:05.002
I decided to come back
to visit Jamie's grave,

30:05.080 --> 30:08.209
to tell him that I never forgot him.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.561
But instead, I found him alive.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.763
I hear truth in what ye're tellin' me.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.441
But I can see it in yer eyes,

30:22.520 --> 30:24.522
there's still something
ye're keepin' from me.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.881
I don't know if I can or even want
to put my trust in you again.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.485
When a horse breaks its leg,

30:32.600 --> 30:35.365
ye put it out of its misery
because it'll never heal right.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.561
Neither will we.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.205
If my mother was still alive,
this would kill her all over again.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.284
Jamie's retired to the stables,

30:59.360 --> 31:02.569
and Janet's given Claire
blankets in the guest chamber.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.564
This doesna bother you?
Him laying with both wives?

31:07.640 --> 31:09.768
He and Laoghaire
are not living as man and wife,

31:09.840 --> 31:10.841
and ye ken it.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.251
He makes a fool of this family.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.766
Ye're the only one being foolish.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.481
If there's a pot of shite on to boil,
ye stir like it's God's work.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.760
This is my fault then?

31:21.120 --> 31:23.600
Dye forget I hear
yer prayers every night?

31:24.200 --> 31:27.727
And all ye ask for is Jamie's happiness,
after all the sorrows he's seen,

31:28.640 --> 31:31.405
and here he is,
but ye canna let him have it.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.884
Does this look like happiness to you?

32:02.080 --> 32:04.481
Claire.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.241
Please.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.410
I should never have come back.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.882
Canna take back those 20 years...

32:20.520 --> 32:22.045
Or the life I've lived.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.289
But I mean to make things right.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.484
I knew coming back was a risk.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.250
That you could be a different person,

32:29.320 --> 32:30.924
that we both could be
different people, but--

32:31.000 --> 32:33.241
I'm still the same person
you fell in love with.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.249
"When you tell me something,

32:37.880 --> 32:39.325
let it be the truth,

32:40.520 --> 32:42.363
and I promise you the same."

32:43.280 --> 32:44.964
Those were your words, Jamie.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.203
We could have secrets, but not lies.

32:51.320 --> 32:54.449
I'm sorry, Claire. Truly.

32:57.320 --> 33:00.244
I've only known one love in my life.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.570
And that was with you.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.045
There's the truth of it then.

33:06.640 --> 33:07.971
Oh, God, Laoghaire.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.407
Laoghaire, put the pistol down.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.481
No.

33:11.560 --> 33:15.121
I will not just sit at home
and let her walk away with ye.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.644
I've come to protect what's mine.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.245
This isna Claire's fault.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.165
Time for her to leave us be.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.488
To stay out of our lives.

33:23.560 --> 33:27.167
You and I have not dwelt
in the same house for many a month.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.250
Maybe it wasna perfect,

33:30.360 --> 33:31.930
but you were mine.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.481
If not under my roof,

33:33.560 --> 33:35.050
ye provided for me and my...

33:39.160 --> 33:40.161
Jamie!

33:40.960 --> 33:42.086
Get away from him!

33:46.400 --> 33:47.401
Jamie!

33:50.000 --> 33:51.809
Help me get him onto the table.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.770
What's a few more scars?
Leave me be. I'm jes fine.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.849
Get me some alcohol, please.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.968
Here. Take this off.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.566
Take your shirt off.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.481
Oh, dear God.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.321
Who did this?

34:10.960 --> 34:11.960
Laoghaire.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.121
It's nothing Claire canna fix.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.683
I'll get clean towels and bandages.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.127
Go get my medical kit.
It's in my bag in the courtyard.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.201
Yeah.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.408
Can you get hot water
and see if you can find an apron?

34:23.480 --> 34:24.481
Aye.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.562
It's only bird shot. Nothing serious.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.165
Have you forgot
what I told you about germs?

34:30.239 --> 34:31.605
Thank you.

34:31.679 --> 34:32.841
I'll help my father.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.931
Here. I'm going to have
to dig those pellets out.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.360
Lie down.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.766
Those are very fancy knives
ye've got there, Auntie.

35:12.680 --> 35:16.162
I knew a very fine cutler
in the Colonies.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.041
All right, this is the one
I'm worried about.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.805
If the pellets penetrated the artery,
then he'll bleed to death,

35:27.880 --> 35:29.609
and there'll be nothing
I can do about it.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.487
Did it penetrate the... artery?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.882
No. He was very lucky.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.521
Auntie.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.769
He has enough alcohol for now.
Thank you.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.164
It's not for Uncle Jamie.
It's for you, Auntie.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.049
You're the only one who calls me that.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.650
Uncle Jamies lucky you're here.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.722
She made a nice Swiss cheese
of your arm.

37:57.480 --> 38:00.131
I dinna ken what Swiss cheese is,
but if it looks like that,

38:01.240 --> 38:02.890
I wouldna want it on my bread.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.841
Well, the pellets are out,

38:06.120 --> 38:07.201
and your artery's intact.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.521
I need a whiskey.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.806
You've had enough.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.051
You need liquids. Water or broth.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.765
Whiskey's a liquid, no?

38:22.440 --> 38:25.171
No. Here. Drink this.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.048
I'll never understand
what you saw in that woman.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.369
Well, she wasn't toting a pistol
when I chanced upon her again.

38:50.520 --> 38:51.521
That's it?

38:53.240 --> 38:54.605
You truly wish to hear?

38:56.680 --> 38:57.681
You won't get angry?

39:01.960 --> 39:04.440
I haven't stopped being angry.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.243
So you might as well explain yourself.

39:13.480 --> 39:14.925
I'd been away so long.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.888
When I returned from Helwater,

39:20.800 --> 39:22.006
from England,

39:23.280 --> 39:24.361
everything was...

39:24.920 --> 39:25.921
different.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.849
Jenny's bairns didn't recognise me.

39:31.480 --> 39:32.641
I was a ghost.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.681
If ye ken what I mean.

39:39.160 --> 39:42.050
Yes... I do.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.006
I was here...

39:45.680 --> 39:46.727
but I wasna home.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.445
I suppose I was lonely.

39:58.200 --> 40:04.401
It was my first Hogmanay at Lallybroch
since I was a lad.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.841
Everything about Lallybroch
was shining, warm.

40:11.360 --> 40:15.285
Jenny had dressed the parlour.
Never seen it so bonny.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.802
The fiddler was by the window there,
playing jigs and reels.

40:19.360 --> 40:22.284
Every table laden with food, drink.

40:23.480 --> 40:27.087
I could feel my father and mother there
and my brother, Willie.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.043
I was filled with joy
and loneliness at the same time.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.285
Do you like figs?

40:41.280 --> 40:43.362
Aye. Thank you.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.890
Would you like to dance?

40:48.240 --> 40:50.208
It's been a very long time
since I tried.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.361
We can teach you.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.846
<i>After a few moments,
my heart felt fighter.</i>

41:22.320 --> 41:25.005
The music wrapped around me,
and I was laughing.

41:29.160 --> 41:33.370
I realised I hadna truly laughed
since that last lime...

41:34.120 --> 41:37.249
Well, the last time I was with you.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.409
Ye're a bonny dancer.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.365
Thank you. So are you.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.089
Ye've fair worked up my appetite.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.330
You Cousin Aileen's daughters?

42:06.680 --> 42:07.727
No.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.450
Our mother is Mistress MacKimmie.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.201
So there she was.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.808
Twice widowed
and two bairns aching for a father.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.046
That was plain enough.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.770
And I found something
to fill the hole I had in me.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.849
Jenny kent it as well.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.968
Urged me to make the match.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.600
I wanted to be a...

42:39.840 --> 42:40.841
A father,

42:41.880 --> 42:42.881
a husband.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.529
All the things I thought
the future held when I was with you.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.010
All the things I had to forget

42:52.600 --> 42:54.284
when I said goodbye to you
at the stones.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.765
To care for Willie

43:00.440 --> 43:01.441
or Brianna...

43:03.320 --> 43:04.651
Watch them grow up,

43:05.280 --> 43:07.931
to show them how to be in the world.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.569
I thought if I married Laoghaire,

43:13.680 --> 43:15.091
I could have all those things.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.401
And did you?

43:22.520 --> 43:26.411
My fondness for Marsali and Joan grew.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.604
It was a very special time for me.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.086
Not always easy...

43:37.320 --> 43:38.321
but...

43:39.200 --> 43:40.406
it was all right.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.250
So then what happened?

43:50.480 --> 43:52.687
How did you end up living in Edinburgh?

43:54.640 --> 43:55.687
There were days...

43:56.600 --> 43:58.443
weeks where she wouldn't speak with me.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.641
To be honest, I didn't mind that.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.608
Meant we wouldn't be
fighting over this or that.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.004
I tried to be gentle with her,

44:10.960 --> 44:12.166
but it was no use.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.371
Maybe it was her first husband, Hugh,

44:17.800 --> 44:20.280
or her second husband, Simon.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.370
Well, nobody kens
what happens in the marriage bed.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.241
She was hurt.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.164
I could see the fear in her eyes.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.567
So I left.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.644
I couldn't bear the thought of...

44:40.520 --> 44:43.126
someone being afraid of my touch.

44:56.800 --> 44:57.847
Christ...

44:58.560 --> 44:59.641
You're burning up.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.604
Why on earth didn't you say something?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.690
I thought it was the heat of shame.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.285
If you won't stay with me,

45:12.760 --> 45:15.843
then I'd rather die and be done with it
if that's all the same to you.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.763
I'm not going to let you die,

45:18.880 --> 45:20.405
tempted as I might be.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.725
What in God's name is that?

45:35.320 --> 45:37.561
Something that will help
bring down your fever.

45:45.480 --> 45:47.687
Now, roll over onto your right side.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.441
Yeah, that...

45:53.760 --> 45:56.286
That looks mighty sharp.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.931
It is,
so you better hold still and relax.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.403
Look, will ye please explain

46:01.480 --> 46:03.084
why jabbing needles in my arse

46:04.080 --> 46:06.526
is going to help my arm?

46:07.760 --> 46:10.650
Because germs
are no match for penicillin.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.284
I had a vision of ye, ye ken.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.611
When Jamie wed Laoghaire,

46:41.920 --> 46:43.649
them standing by the altar,

46:44.880 --> 46:46.245
ye were there with them,

46:47.920 --> 46:50.002
standing betwixt him and Laoghaire.

46:55.320 --> 46:58.403
I didna ken who ye were or what.

46:59.720 --> 47:03.327
We didna know your...
people or your place.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.447
Even when Jamie told me

47:04.520 --> 47:06.761
you might tell me things
that might no' make any sense,

47:06.840 --> 47:07.921
I didna question it.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.806
Ye said plant potatoes, I did as told.

47:12.520 --> 47:15.524
The crop kept us alive for more
than one winter after Culloden.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.046
You saved us, and I never asked ye
about any of it, did I?

47:19.080 --> 47:20.161
Jamie chose ye.

47:20.920 --> 47:21.921
That was enough.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.889
But it's not enough now, is it?

47:32.320 --> 47:34.209
I suppose ye'll never
tell me the full story.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.250
What I can tell you...

47:47.520 --> 47:49.887
is that I love your brother very much.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.050
I never forgot him.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.727
Or any of you.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.248
I never stopped wearing
his wedding ring.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.730
You were a sister to me.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.645
I loved you too, Jenny.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.000
Still do.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.685
I'm only asking for a second chance.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.407
My dear, is it truly you?

48:47.960 --> 48:49.371
Ned!

48:50.960 --> 48:52.962
What are you doing here?

48:53.040 --> 48:55.884
Well, I've come to speak
to your husband.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.361
You're a feast for these old eyes.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.166
Pardon me. I'm...

49:06.280 --> 49:07.964
I'm a trifle overcome.

49:08.320 --> 49:11.847
You look exactly the same.
What is your secret?

49:12.720 --> 49:13.960
I never married.

49:16.200 --> 49:20.364
Well, with the return
of the first Mrs James Fraser,

49:20.800 --> 49:25.044
legally, the marriage
to Laoghaire MacKimmie is invalid.

49:25.880 --> 49:29.362
You'll have to make reconciliations
with the Church, mind ye.

49:29.440 --> 49:30.805
It's a price I'm willing to pay.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.765
Funny you should mention that.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.764
Laoghaire has made a complaint
to the Justice of the Peace,

49:36.400 --> 49:38.801
for distress and loss of support.

49:38.880 --> 49:39.881
How could she do that?

49:39.960 --> 49:43.328
"Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned."

49:44.600 --> 49:46.568
But she shot him.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.801
Indeed,

49:47.920 --> 49:50.127
and in the Highlands, as we know,

49:50.200 --> 49:54.569
the Disarming Act means that
owning a firearm is a criminal offense.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.169
Now, where is the weapon now?

49:59.280 --> 50:01.681
Young Jamie
has it hidden in the stables.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.570
Any way of proving
that it belongs to Laoghaire?

50:04.640 --> 50:06.210
Well, besides myself and Claire
bearing witness

50:06.280 --> 50:07.964
and the five holes in my arm...

50:09.800 --> 50:10.801
No.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.371
Well, if it proceeds lo trial
and you're summoned to court,

50:15.880 --> 50:17.245
she may be indicted.

50:18.560 --> 50:23.407
We could arrange for the weapon
to be turned over to the British.

50:24.080 --> 50:25.525
And what would happen to her?

50:25.840 --> 50:29.367
If found guilty, she could be
transported to the Colonies.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.450
Virginia, most likely.

50:33.480 --> 50:35.801
I do hear Richmond
is nice this time of year.

50:35.880 --> 50:36.961
Indeed.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.201
No.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.404
No, I won't turn the pistol over.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.082
But she must be punished for this.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.731
Aye, you're right.
Laoghaire deserves to be punished,

50:50.800 --> 50:52.006
but I willna do it to the girls.

50:53.440 --> 50:57.331
They're already losing a father.
I won't have them lose a mother as well.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.081
What does Laoghaire want?

51:06.600 --> 51:09.331
Well, I believe her chief desire
is to have you castrated

51:09.400 --> 51:12.165
and your bollocks mounted on her wall,

51:12.240 --> 51:16.643
but I suspect that
she may be amenable to alimony.

51:18.800 --> 51:19.801
How much?

51:26.360 --> 51:29.250
Twenty pounds? That's two years' wages!

51:30.040 --> 51:31.769
And ten pounds a year

51:31.840 --> 51:34.764
lo maintain her household for the girls
until they're properly wed.

51:34.840 --> 51:35.966
That's an outrageous sum.

51:38.440 --> 51:39.566
Aye, I ken.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.687
But I won't put that burden on you.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.201
Where do ye intend
to get the money to pay her?

51:46.720 --> 51:48.006
There's a place I know.

51:50.200 --> 51:53.283
There's a box full of ancient coins...

51:54.440 --> 51:55.805
on Silkie Island.

51:57.120 --> 51:58.326
I swam there once.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.043
Maybe I could go back and get it.

52:01.120 --> 52:04.010
You can't swim anywhere,
not until that arm's healed.

52:04.520 --> 52:05.601
How far is it?

52:08.520 --> 52:09.965
Maybe a quarter mile.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.049
Aye. I can swim that.

52:13.480 --> 52:15.084
I'm a better swimmer
than either of my brothers.

52:15.160 --> 52:17.606
Away you go.
You can bring that in later.

52:22.600 --> 52:25.331
What good are ancient coins
in the Highlands?

52:25.400 --> 52:27.687
Laoghaire canna use them
for food and rents.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.205
I'll take them to France.

52:29.920 --> 52:33.242
Cousin Jared will know
how lo trade them for sterling.

52:33.640 --> 52:35.244
He's family. He'll be discreet.

52:35.680 --> 52:38.490
Then I'll bring the proceeds
back for Laoghaire.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.529
I'd also like to take
Young Ian to France <i>as</i> well,

52:44.160 --> 52:45.207
if that's all right with you.

52:45.960 --> 52:49.806
He's old enough to see
a bit of the world outside of Scotland.

52:50.800 --> 52:54.930
You and I had our time in France, Ian.
Better that than war.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.250
I suppose it's best
we let him have his freedom

53:04.320 --> 53:06.402
while he still thinks it's ours to give.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.526
You'll take better care
of him this time, aye?

53:12.840 --> 53:13.841
We will.

53:18.960 --> 53:19.961
You can trust us.

53:28.760 --> 53:30.364
The water must be freezing.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.161
'Tis.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.964
It's the current
that's the worst part of it.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.760
Ye must surrender to it.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.321
But as ye come nearer the island,

53:44.400 --> 53:47.882
ye must break free of it
or be carried away to the New World.

53:49.520 --> 53:50.760
Dinna fash.

53:50.840 --> 53:52.410
Ian's a braw swimmer.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.845
We've barely been alone
since we left Edinburgh.

54:14.480 --> 54:17.529
Now we're the only two people
on this cliff,

54:18.160 --> 54:19.491
and ye canna meet my eye.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.488
I'm afraid this is...

54:28.560 --> 54:30.130
all a mistake.

54:34.040 --> 54:37.089
I'm just not sure
if we belong together any more.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.731
How can ye say that?

54:42.080 --> 54:43.286
I had a life.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.090
We both had lives.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.961
And families.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.209
It wasn't the plan, but...

54:53.080 --> 54:54.889
I didn't hate Boston.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.040
I had a career.

54:58.720 --> 54:59.721
A home.

55:01.240 --> 55:02.241
Friends.

55:03.880 --> 55:05.962
And you had your print shop
in Edinburgh.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.323
It wasn't so bad, really, was it?

55:12.800 --> 55:16.043
Being a printer was naught
compared to being your husband.

55:24.240 --> 55:27.369
For 20 years,
I was haunted by the memory of you.

55:30.760 --> 55:33.331
And when I found out
you were alive, I...

55:37.400 --> 55:39.721
But ever since
I've arrived back, it's been...

55:40.760 --> 55:43.366
so much harder
than I could ever have imagined.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.445
When has it ever been easy?

55:52.040 --> 55:53.690
But I apologised for it.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.484
I've done all I can to make it right.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.327
Ye belong with me.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.890
We're mated for life, Sassenach.

56:08.920 --> 56:13.687
Will you risk the man I am
for the sake of the one ye once knew?

56:18.160 --> 56:19.161
Jamie.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.041
Christ.

56:44.040 --> 56:45.166
Where's Ian?

56:47.120 --> 56:48.121
There.

56:49.800 --> 56:50.847
Making his way down.

56:59.400 --> 57:00.401
Ian!

57:01.200 --> 57:02.201
Ian!

57:03.240 --> 57:04.321
Go back!

57:40.480 --> 57:43.211
Jamie, no! You can't! You're hurl!

57:50.800 --> 57:51.926
Ian!
