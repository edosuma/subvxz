DAISUKE JIGEN'S GRAVESTONE
PART 1

01:07.402 --> 01:10.570
Seems that the test transaction
went fine, Mr. President.

01:10.571 --> 01:14.659
The Little Comet may be twinkling
in your eyes as early as tomorrow.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.043
What are you
doing? Hurry up!

01:24.044 --> 01:25.461
I-I can't, sir.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.801
Excuse me, sir, but can
I see some identification?

01:31.802 --> 01:34.052
Can't you see the flag?

01:34.053 --> 01:36.680
I'm the Ambassador of
the Republic of Malanda.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.308
This is a matter of
international importance, and-

01:40.768 --> 01:42.937
Ah, so sorry!
I had no idea.

01:42.938 --> 01:44.063
Sir!

02:06.794 --> 02:09.756
What are you doing?
That's a diplomatic car!

02:11.257 --> 02:12.633
Move it!

02:25.897 --> 02:29.192
EAST DOROA

02:31.110 --> 02:34.488
All right, now we set course
for treasure, full speed ahead!

02:34.489 --> 02:38.993
"World-Famous East Doroan Singer
Queen Malta Assassinated in West Doroa.

02:38.994 --> 02:43.498
Violation of East-West Doroa Nonaggression
Pact. Negotiations Ongoing...?"

02:43.790 --> 02:47.564
What's West Doroa doing
breaking a peace treaty?

02:47.565 --> 02:51.339
Trying to turn the whole
world against them?

02:51.547 --> 02:54.675
I can't understand it. This all
used to be the same country,

02:54.676 --> 02:57.804
and yet now even innocents
are getting caught up in things.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.515
What's wrong? Still carrying
that weight on your shoulders?

03:00.516 --> 03:03.726
I could have
protected her. That's all.

03:03.727 --> 03:06.938
When I die, I hope
it's not like this.

03:14.821 --> 03:16.988
This whole city's on edge.

03:16.989 --> 03:20.451
Of course they are, East Doroa has one of the
highest crime prevention rates in the world.

03:20.452 --> 03:23.787
This city's like the honor
student the whole world's proud of.

03:23.788 --> 03:28.042
So that's why the embassies and
mansions all have such heavy guard?

03:28.043 --> 03:30.565
Might use up our
thieves' luck on this one.

03:30.566 --> 03:33.089
Just try and go easy
on me, if you would.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.400
Your luggage?

04:01.951 --> 04:03.202
Go ahead.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.347
Welcome, sir. We appreciate
the long journey you've made.

04:23.348 --> 04:25.308
Not at all. More importantly,
is the sample ready?

04:25.309 --> 04:26.893
This way, sir.

04:28.895 --> 04:30.228
This is the Little Comet.

04:30.229 --> 04:35.151
They say it really is a shard of a comet, one
that fell on East Doroa in the middle ages.

04:35.152 --> 04:39.134
I'm amazed East Doroa would
even part with a treasure like this!

04:39.135 --> 04:43.117
It just proves that there's
something else they want even more.

04:43.118 --> 04:43.950
Go on...

04:43.951 --> 04:46.453
Well, surely you must know
I'm referring to West Doroa.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.373
What with the uranium-enriching facilities
that we're giving the East Doroans

04:49.374 --> 04:51.416
in exchange for this treasure.

04:51.417 --> 04:55.212
It's not so difficult to imagine
what they might use them for.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.255
What a bunch of fools.

04:57.256 --> 05:02.365
Well, we of the Republic of Malanda are
of course entirely neutral on the subject.

05:02.366 --> 05:07.475
We're only selling the arms, it's entirely
up to East Doroa how they use them.

05:07.476 --> 05:08.475
That's right.

05:08.476 --> 05:12.103
Here now, won't you
inspect it for yourself?

05:12.104 --> 05:15.358
These are the keys for the
combination lock down here.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.408
Tsk. They're catching on.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.914
Is something the matter?

05:33.584 --> 05:35.044
Who in the hell are you?

05:37.755 --> 05:42.343
Jigen, what did you do that for? I still
hadn't asked him for the combination.

05:42.635 --> 05:44.594
No time for talking. Let's run.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.932
That's awfully quick. I don't
remember us having failed.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.559
Guess this is
our only exit.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.103
You go first.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.648
Dammit!

06:02.697 --> 06:04.073
They're here!

06:05.825 --> 06:09.203
Look at that, these
guys aren't half bad.

06:09.204 --> 06:10.141
Now what?

06:10.142 --> 06:11.080
This way!

06:42.903 --> 06:46.657
What's going on? It's like
they're reading our every move.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.917
Lupin.

07:00.046 --> 07:02.193
That's some poor sap's car.

07:02.194 --> 07:04.340
How could we be so savage?

07:04.341 --> 07:06.844
We won't be much of anything
if we don't find a way out.

07:06.845 --> 07:08.512
Ahhh, damn it. Let's go!

07:24.111 --> 07:25.321
One.

07:33.162 --> 07:34.579
Jigen!

07:34.580 --> 07:35.998
Agh...

07:39.210 --> 07:40.544
Him...?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.178
Two.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.306
Lupin!

07:53.307 --> 07:56.602
Ouch! Shit!

08:09.532 --> 08:12.910
Unforgivable! Who the
hell has it in for us?

08:13.786 --> 08:16.997
I've only seen this
shape once before.

08:16.998 --> 08:18.624
What? Where?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.127
Queen Malta.

08:21.128 --> 08:21.960
Huh?

08:21.961 --> 08:23.587
That day...

08:26.298 --> 08:29.301
7 DAYS EARLIER
WEST DOROA INTERNATIONAL CONCERT HALL

09:33.949 --> 09:35.033
So you're saying,

09:35.034 --> 09:38.078
Queen Malta's assassin
is gunning for us now?

09:38.079 --> 09:40.998
I'm not absolutely certain, but... huh?

09:42.833 --> 09:44.709
What are they doing here?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.963
That's Honor Student City
for you. Off we go.

09:47.964 --> 09:49.589
Where're we headed?

09:49.590 --> 09:51.800
I've got something I
want to check out.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.598
Jigen, what is it
you're looking for?

10:02.436 --> 10:03.938
I thought so.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.361
Have you been a
ghost this whole time?

10:11.570 --> 10:14.072
I heard a rumor
on the wind once.

10:14.073 --> 10:18.911
About Yael Okuzaki, a killer who prepares
a gravestone for his targets beforehand.

10:18.912 --> 10:22.873
He never kills for personal reasons,
only with a client behind him.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.960
Never heard of him.
What kind of guy is he?

10:25.961 --> 10:28.419
There's almost no information.

10:28.420 --> 10:32.758
Mostly because no one's
outlived being targeted by him.

10:33.384 --> 10:36.594
All I know is, he's
so sure of himself,

10:36.595 --> 10:41.350
he rolls a die to choose how
many shots he'll use on a mark.

10:42.977 --> 10:46.730
Merriment, warmth, and welcoming. Victory.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.398
What's this all of a sudden?

10:48.399 --> 10:51.944
It's what parsley symbolizes.
Plus, an omen of death.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.698
So he must really
enjoy killing, huh.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.914
Think you can take him?

11:04.623 --> 11:08.919
You wound me. You
really think I could lose?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.714
He hasn't left anyone
alive before, has he?

11:12.006 --> 11:14.132
That wound leaves you
in bad shape, too.

11:14.133 --> 11:17.428
We don't need two
number-one gunmen in the world.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.307
Always looking out for your
friends, even at a time like this.

11:21.557 --> 11:25.769
Don't get me wrong. You and I
are business partners, that's all.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.103
Not friends.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.523
That so? Well, do
what you like then.

11:47.249 --> 11:51.670
What a privilege, to be able to work
with a rare beauty like you.

11:51.671 --> 11:54.381
Well, you've got a
way with words.

11:54.382 --> 11:57.091
Our membership is quite exclusive.

11:57.092 --> 12:01.764
We accept only distinguished guests,
from some of the finest families around.

12:01.765 --> 12:03.974
No need to fear any trouble.

12:03.975 --> 12:05.975
That's a relief.

12:05.976 --> 12:09.229
Now then, if you'd please wait
here until showtime comes.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.068
Found you at last.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.072
It's about time for
the show to begin.

13:00.073 --> 13:02.658
Gosh, is it time already?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.455
How bothersome.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.293
That's hardly an appropriate thing for
a lady such as yourself to lay hands on.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.379
Come on, put me down!

13:25.180 --> 13:27.473
Going to kill me,
Daisuke Jigen?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.393
Lupin the Third, how did
you find this place?

13:30.394 --> 13:34.898
You didn't notice? That was genuine
parsley on your gravestone.

13:34.899 --> 13:37.818
Not to mention it smelled
faintly of anemone.

13:40.154 --> 13:43.824
Not so many places around here
where wild anemones grow...

13:44.199 --> 13:44.740
Are there?

13:44.741 --> 13:47.786
Go home. I've got no intention
of asking for anybody's help.

13:47.787 --> 13:50.455
I'm not really doing this for your sake.

13:50.456 --> 13:55.231
Call it curiosity. I want to know who's
sending Yael Okuzaki after you and why.

13:55.232 --> 14:00.007
It must be the people from the embassy,
trying to get back the treasure we stole.

14:00.008 --> 14:02.675
So then where
was my gravestone?

14:02.676 --> 14:06.138
Something smells funny about
this. I'm here to check it out.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.099
Just try and keep your
"curiosity" under control.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.727
I could say the exact
same thing to you.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.691
This place feels abandoned.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.612
Sure doesn't seem to
be their home base.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.328
It's a gun workshop.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.128
Hurry it up.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.672
Don't push me!

14:43.133 --> 14:45.302
It's full of communications equipment.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.058
Hey. Look at this.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.186
Looks like these guys
have plenty of hobbies.

14:54.187 --> 14:56.647
They must be
good with their fingers.

14:58.649 --> 15:01.568
That's strange, it's just the
same suit over and over.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.447
Looks like Prada. Don't you wear
things like this too, Jigen?

15:05.989 --> 15:09.409
My tastes span all the way
from Givenchy to Fendi.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.119
- I see.
- <i>Is someone here?</i>

15:11.787 --> 15:14.206
- <i>Let me out!</i>
- That's Fujiko's voice!

15:14.207 --> 15:16.291
- <i>Somebody!</i>
- This way!

15:16.708 --> 15:18.919
<i>Please, is anyone there?</i>

15:20.128 --> 15:21.004
That's it!

15:22.464 --> 15:23.340
Fujiko!

15:24.091 --> 15:26.218
Fujiko, can you hear
me? What happened?

15:26.219 --> 15:28.094
<i>That voice... Lupin?</i>

15:28.095 --> 15:30.639
Is Yael Okuzaki out for you too?

15:30.640 --> 15:32.558
<i>Who's he?</i>

15:32.849 --> 15:35.977
<i>I thought I'd try being
a showgirl for this club,</i>

15:35.978 --> 15:38.105
<i>but it looks like I've gotten
caught up in a real mess.</i>

15:38.480 --> 15:40.816
What're you trying to
pull this time, Fujiko?

15:40.817 --> 15:43.442
<i>Don't ruin my good name.</i>

15:43.443 --> 15:46.904
<i>I was just trying to get
out of the thieving business.</i>

15:46.905 --> 15:50.284
<i>Looks like it's time to pay my dues,
though. I think it's the end for me.</i>

15:50.285 --> 15:52.702
Hey, don't go jinxing yourself!

15:52.703 --> 15:55.539
<i>I mean it, Lupin. But
don't try and save me.</i>

15:56.456 --> 16:01.253
<i>It's too dangerous here. I don't
want to sacrifice you too. Goodbye.</i>

16:01.461 --> 16:05.716
You're underestimating me.
Who do you think I am, anyway?

16:05.717 --> 16:07.968
<i>It's hopeless! Stay away!</i>

16:09.344 --> 16:11.888
Well, you'll never know
if we don't give it a try!

16:11.889 --> 16:14.182
Care to give it a try, then?

16:16.059 --> 16:16.810
Wait.

16:17.269 --> 16:21.814
I need to ask you something. Why do
you have Fujiko under surveillance?

16:21.815 --> 16:26.361
I know nothing about the girl. I was
keeping watch on some stolen property.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.696
So why are you after Jigen?

16:28.697 --> 16:32.783
No particular reason. I'm
just taking care of a target.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.245
I see now. But he was getting to
be a real thorn in your side.

16:36.246 --> 16:42.252
Why else would a sniper get this close to their
target? You'll never beat Jigen at a quick draw.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.962
You've made two mistakes.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.882
One, sniping isn't my only specialty.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.219
Two, I think you'll find
yourselves to be the ones lacking.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.596
Give it a shot, then.

16:52.597 --> 16:53.722
Do it!

16:56.516 --> 17:00.979
I've got a debt to repay you.
Time to pay it back in full.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.318
You want a left-handed duel?

17:07.109 --> 17:10.446
Fine. Draw whenever you like.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.461
<i>Three.</i>

17:34.346 --> 17:36.347
Jigen lost?

17:36.348 --> 17:37.808
Of course he did.

17:40.018 --> 17:44.439
A .357 Magnum? A massive gun like that
isn't the lightest choice for a quick shot.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.149
Well, the sideshow's
coming to a close.

17:47.150 --> 17:51.488
This next bullet, Daisuke Jigen,
will be the end of you.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.700
You're not in shape for this.
We need to retreat.

17:54.701 --> 17:55.951
Get away, Lupin!

17:55.952 --> 17:57.202
Just come with me!

18:03.792 --> 18:06.669
Well, I never thought I'd
see the day you lost a draw.

18:06.670 --> 18:12.217
His gun was lighter. .22 caliber. Looks
like he shaved a lot of weight off it, too.

18:12.218 --> 18:16.304
So you could beat him if
you just used a gun that light?

18:16.555 --> 18:17.973
Sorry, not happening.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.767
Is this really the time to be stubborn?

18:39.369 --> 18:40.328
Here he comes!

18:40.329 --> 18:41.371
Him?!

19:16.490 --> 19:19.618
If I don't get him with one clean
shot, my pride will be gone!

19:19.910 --> 19:21.119
It's up to you, Jigen!

19:22.454 --> 19:23.266
Damn it!

19:23.267 --> 19:24.080
No good?

19:29.753 --> 19:31.338
Let's get him, Jigen.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.261
How do you like this?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.189
What the hell!

19:50.190 --> 19:53.360
I thought he only fired the
number he rolled on the die?

19:57.906 --> 20:00.992
Maybe he has some very
particular rules for himself.

20:00.993 --> 20:04.037
How should I know?

20:08.625 --> 20:11.044
That's what you get!

20:12.504 --> 20:13.797
No good.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.016
God, what is this stuff?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.713
Finally, we lost him.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.719
No way he's following us this far.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.053
I'm going to get my revenge.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.182
Yup. Even he must
have a blind spot.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.894
Lupin... he's back.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.730
He's pretty clingy!

21:37.088 --> 21:39.090
Spectacular.

21:44.721 --> 21:45.679
Jigen...

21:45.680 --> 21:47.349
End of the road.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.239
Where'd he go now?

22:04.282 --> 22:05.742
Up there!

22:09.454 --> 22:10.663
Dammit.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.374
He's got us pinned.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.557
We can't get away if we don't
get through that warehouse.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.020
Guess we'd better get going, then.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.731
Stop! If you go flying
out there, you're his.

22:37.732 --> 22:41.236
It's not that simple.
There's no way I'm dying here.

22:41.237 --> 22:43.362
Have a little faith, Jigen.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.657
I'm not gonna go running
out there before it's time.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.744
On the count of three, we're
gonna run for that warehouse.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.996
You're betting my life on this?

22:51.997 --> 22:55.959
I'm the one he's coming for. If this
goes wrong, I'm going to haunt you forever.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.419
Yup. Sorry.

22:57.420 --> 22:58.837
Shit.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.507
Fools. It's useless.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.052
Here we go.

23:06.053 --> 23:06.844
Right.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.639
One, two, three!

23:09.640 --> 23:11.683
Four.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.773
Jigen! Hey!

23:21.860 --> 23:22.860
Jigen!

23:22.861 --> 23:24.404
Stay with me!

23:25.030 --> 23:26.531
Hey, Jigen!

23:29.242 --> 23:33.245
How does it feel, watching your
friend die before your eyes?

23:33.246 --> 23:39.169
That's what happens when you make hopeless
plans. You see how worthless you are?

23:40.628 --> 23:45.175
I can see you're a master
gunman. If you ask me, though?

23:45.176 --> 23:47.552
You're just a gun yourself.

23:48.845 --> 23:54.559
You're a tool, unable to fire
unless someone hires and pays you.

23:55.518 --> 23:59.272
Be glad of that. It's why
you'll leave here alive.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.709
Stop it!

24:29.260 --> 24:32.972
TO BE CONTINUED...

27:45.081 --> 27:49.294
DAISUKE JIGEN'S GRAVESTONE
PART 2

27:59.429 --> 28:02.056
On your way home from work?

28:03.850 --> 28:06.978
Chilly night tonight, isn't it.

28:23.202 --> 28:29.459
That's Yael Okuzaki for you. The mechs
he crafts are as elegant as his killings.

28:29.460 --> 28:32.170
I suppose this will do.
Time for the finale.

28:32.171 --> 28:33.338
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

28:55.735 --> 28:56.777
The hell?

28:56.778 --> 28:58.112
What's going on?

28:59.030 --> 29:00.614
What's this now?

29:00.615 --> 29:03.409
Very sorry to barge in on the fun.

29:05.870 --> 29:10.624
But I, Lupin the Third, will be
taking this enchanting showgirl now.

29:10.625 --> 29:15.505
<i>Perverted ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to ask
you all to vacate your seats with all haste.</i>

29:15.506 --> 29:19.717
I fear this man wasn't on the
invite list. Let's show him the door.

29:24.222 --> 29:25.681
Lupin...

29:25.848 --> 29:28.810
Whoa! Don't you look dazzling.

29:28.811 --> 29:30.394
Oh, come on!

29:30.395 --> 29:33.147
I'm here to save
you, like I promised.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.859
What a meddlesome man.

29:41.531 --> 29:42.657
Do it.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.129
Guess I can't quite do it like Jigen did.

30:00.508 --> 30:01.676
All right then!

30:05.179 --> 30:08.141
Come on, what would you
have done if that hit me?

30:08.142 --> 30:09.809
Sorry, sorry.

30:16.274 --> 30:17.567
Uh-oh.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.278
Hang on! Is this a joke?

30:26.659 --> 30:29.162
Hm? The woman's vanished.

30:32.123 --> 30:33.770
Hey, so she has.

30:33.771 --> 30:35.418
She can't be...

30:37.753 --> 30:40.548
You've interrupted my performance!

30:51.184 --> 30:53.811
Don't hold this against me, Lupin.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.583
Nice timing there, Fujiko!

31:16.584 --> 31:19.252
What do you think
you're doing? Get off!

31:19.253 --> 31:23.049
Come on, after I came all
this way to help you out?

31:23.050 --> 31:25.218
I didn't ask you to do that!

31:33.434 --> 31:35.895
The graveyard, of all
places. Is here okay?

31:35.896 --> 31:36.603
Sure.

31:36.604 --> 31:37.812
Then hurry up
and get down.

31:37.813 --> 31:43.110
Fine, fine... Hey, Fujiko, what were you
even doing there in the first place?

31:43.111 --> 31:47.823
I told you, didn't I? I was
just working as a showgirl.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.700
So what's this then?

31:50.952 --> 31:52.578
When did you...?

31:52.579 --> 31:54.204
C'mon, you know me.

31:54.205 --> 31:59.210
The more you tell me not to come
save you, the more I want to go.

31:59.211 --> 32:01.316
You took advantage
of my kind nature!

32:01.317 --> 32:03.422
Well, I guess you've seen through me.

32:03.631 --> 32:07.593
So, can you tell me?
What you're really after?

32:11.013 --> 32:12.556
The Calamity File.

32:12.557 --> 32:15.100
The Calamity File? What's that?

32:15.101 --> 32:21.232
It's a log of all the assassination orders
that East Doroa's been carrying out in secret.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.775
Assassination orders?

32:22.776 --> 32:24.067
That's right.

32:24.068 --> 32:28.864
It's full of foreign spies who were
no longer useful to the East Doroans,

32:28.865 --> 32:31.596
plus some pretty important officials.

32:31.597 --> 32:34.328
This book is just one part of it.

32:34.329 --> 32:36.413
If this file went public,

32:36.414 --> 32:39.875
people would be saying the country was
falling apart and vanishing off the map.

32:39.876 --> 32:43.253
Some very confidential documents, then.

32:43.254 --> 32:46.881
So you were snooping around to
find this and sell it for a high price,

32:46.882 --> 32:50.636
but you were found out, and the Pervert Club
decided to keep you around till they killed you?

32:50.637 --> 32:52.325
That's about it!

32:52.326 --> 32:54.171
So, that's enough...

32:54.172 --> 32:56.017
Give it back already!

32:56.892 --> 32:59.854
Now I see. Thanks
to you, I finally see.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.732
Here's why they were after Jigen.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.608
What now?

33:04.609 --> 33:06.068
Follow me.

33:08.571 --> 33:11.073
Jigen actually got taken down?

33:11.699 --> 33:12.949
Yep.

33:12.950 --> 33:16.120
By this mystery hitman Yael Okuzaki.

33:16.871 --> 33:21.458
Who, by the way, has some connection to
the owner of your secret club back there.

33:21.459 --> 33:26.047
Just a few days ago, Jigen was asked
by this world-famous singer Queen Malta,

33:26.048 --> 33:30.176
here in East Doroa, to
be her private bodyguard.

33:30.177 --> 33:31.301
Her bodyguard?

33:31.302 --> 33:36.974
Queen Malta wanted her motherland of East Doroa
to stop all the fighting with West Doroa,

33:36.975 --> 33:41.228
so she put together a concert that was
supposed to help bring peace between them.

33:43.064 --> 33:46.108
8 DAYS EARLIER
WEST DOROA INTERNATIONAL CONCERT HALL

33:48.569 --> 33:51.989
Why would you put yourself in
so much danger just to sing here?

33:52.782 --> 33:55.993
You're one to ask. Why are
you in this line of work?

33:59.038 --> 34:00.373
I'm sorry.

34:01.082 --> 34:06.087
I'd really like to believe that my music
can help these war-torn people, somehow.

34:07.129 --> 34:12.467
You're brave enough. Willing to go straight
to the enemy just for your singing.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.181
It's not as if this country
is the only enemy.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.603
<i>Then came the day of the concert.</i>

34:23.853 --> 34:24.688
Cancel?

34:24.688 --> 34:26.147
Look at the spot I'm in!

34:26.148 --> 34:30.360
I'm her manager, you think I'll allow her to
just hire a bodyguard without running it by me?

34:30.362 --> 34:32.529
Look, that's all her business.

34:32.530 --> 34:35.074
All I know is, I got the request
straight from her, and I took it on.

34:35.074 --> 34:39.327
This concert is supposed
to be a call for world peace!

34:39.328 --> 34:44.250
If people knew she hired some bodyguard,
how would that make East Doroa look?

34:44.251 --> 34:45.625
What does she think about this?

34:45.626 --> 34:49.714
She doesn't know the way the world is. I can't
cater to her every selfish little whim.

34:49.715 --> 34:52.799
Look, here's your
compensation, now that's enough.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.803
<i>But Jigen figured he should at
least earn what he was paid.</i>

34:56.804 --> 35:01.100
<i>So the day of the concert,
he slipped into the hall, but...</i>

35:04.478 --> 35:07.189
<i>Queen Malta was shot dead
right before his eyes.</i>

35:09.608 --> 35:13.778
So that's how we come to Jigen
getting targeted by Yael Okuzaki.

35:13.779 --> 35:20.369
And it looks like the owner of your secret
club is the one who put out the hit.

35:20.370 --> 35:24.957
This Calamity File you found
just ties it all together.

35:25.750 --> 35:26.750
What'll you do?

35:26.751 --> 35:30.921
Pretty obvious, isn't it? I'm gonna lure
the guy out and make him pay for Jigen.

35:30.922 --> 35:33.381
How are you supposed to lure him out?

35:33.382 --> 35:37.136
Hey, hang on! Are you
planning to use that file as bait?

35:37.137 --> 35:39.929
Aw, are you worried about me?

35:39.930 --> 35:43.099
What are you talking about?!
Just give me back the file.

35:43.100 --> 35:49.314
C'mon, don't say that. An eye for an
eye, tooth for a tooth, you know?

35:49.315 --> 35:53.110
There'll just be one chance to decide
everything. Only question is, will he get me?

35:53.111 --> 35:56.906
Or will I get him? It's a contest.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.790
Yael Okuzaki. I've a job for you.

36:06.791 --> 36:10.753
Taking a look now. Two targets this time?

36:10.754 --> 36:12.879
<i>Start with the man.</i>

36:12.880 --> 36:18.511
<i>He's in possession of the file. When
you've finished, recover it immediately.</i>

36:48.707 --> 36:50.209
Welcome, sir.

36:50.668 --> 36:52.127
Hot coffee, please.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.946
Here you are.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.574
Thanks very much.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.371
Sir, your wounds...

37:27.955 --> 37:30.165
Pardon, none of my business.

37:41.677 --> 37:44.138
You're an unlucky man.

38:02.615 --> 38:07.870
Westerly wind. Adjust two degrees...
got you.

38:08.829 --> 38:12.333
This is the end, Lupin.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.459
One.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.903
Impossible...!

38:49.119 --> 38:53.289
How?! I watched Daisuke Jigen die!

38:53.290 --> 38:58.065
But I'm alive. Pretty sure it was me
that just shot out your left knee.

38:58.066 --> 39:02.841
<i>It was sure rough trying to find a
weak spot on someone like you.</i>

39:07.179 --> 39:09.139
This was a trap?

39:10.724 --> 39:13.393
You held the key to this whole
puzzle yourself, Okuzaki.

39:13.394 --> 39:18.690
When you took that first shot on
us, I knew something was up.

39:18.691 --> 39:23.988
How could you have timed
that shot well enough to hit Jigen

39:23.989 --> 39:27.324
as we moved between buildings?

39:27.325 --> 39:29.325
And one other thing.

39:29.326 --> 39:33.455
Those cops were oddly accurate
in predicting our escape route.

39:33.789 --> 39:38.585
There must be some secret behind why this
city's crime prevention rate is so high.

39:38.586 --> 39:43.090
And then it came to me.
The surveillance system.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.687
You're not blind in
your right eye at all.

39:57.688 --> 40:00.733
In fact, I'm guessing it sees
more than the other one ever could.

40:02.860 --> 40:07.989
You connected a video feed
right into your own retina,

40:07.990 --> 40:12.828
and you've been getting signals
from the city cameras wirelessly.

40:13.454 --> 40:17.165
Which is how you knew we
were coming out of your blind spot,

40:17.166 --> 40:20.878
and why you could take that
perfectly timed, impossible shot.

40:20.879 --> 40:25.215
For a guy who can fashion
his own gun and build robots,

40:25.216 --> 40:28.469
it'd be all in a day's
work, am I wrong?

40:30.763 --> 40:34.850
Well, you can fool anybody
if you know the right tricks.

40:35.142 --> 40:36.601
You couldn't have...

40:36.602 --> 40:42.232
The night you tried to kill Jigen, we
turned your own tricks against you.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.028
With a little help from
a camera we altered.

40:46.653 --> 40:51.617
The feed you were watching at that
moment was point five seconds behind.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.579
On the count of three, we're
gonna run for that warehouse.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.332
You're betting my life on this?

41:02.377 --> 41:03.378
Here we go.

41:03.379 --> 41:04.128
Right.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.965
One, two, three!

41:06.966 --> 41:08.509
Four.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.268
Jigen! Hey!

41:18.811 --> 41:22.856
I even got burned. It was
tough without a rehearsal.

41:23.148 --> 41:29.238
Nah, you're a natural actor. Why not try
out for a Broadway role as a dead body?

41:29.530 --> 41:31.323
Sorry, I think not.

41:32.908 --> 41:39.123
Basically, you took the bait and we tricked
you into believing you killed Jigen.

41:39.124 --> 41:43.168
Your overconfidence was your undoing.

41:44.753 --> 41:47.713
How did you know
where I was firing from?

41:47.714 --> 41:53.929
This really came in handy. We
borrowed a couple tools from your hideout.

41:54.638 --> 41:56.013
Damn you!

41:56.014 --> 41:59.852
Let me tell you what my
right eye's seeing right now.

42:07.401 --> 42:11.113
It's the same scenery that
you're looking out over.

42:14.491 --> 42:18.870
That's enough storytelling,
Lupin the Third. Let's get to the point.

42:18.871 --> 42:26.211
All right. This Calamity File is full of
reports on spies from all kinds of countries.

42:26.212 --> 42:28.796
How did you get all this information?

42:28.797 --> 42:32.926
The answer lies in the city's network
of top-secret surveillance cameras.

42:32.927 --> 42:34.010
<i>That sound right?</i>

42:34.011 --> 42:36.429
You can think whatever you want.

42:36.430 --> 42:41.058
Only thing that doesn't line up is, why
would Queen Malta be written in here?

42:41.059 --> 42:46.231
If this was all orchestrated by a civilian private
club owner, this file is looking pretty valuable.

42:46.232 --> 42:51.820
The owner must just be a go-between, and whoever's
really behind things is still out there.

42:51.821 --> 42:54.948
Who asked you to
kill Queen Malta?

42:55.240 --> 42:57.700
There's no need for
you to know that.

42:57.701 --> 43:01.496
Maybe the East Doroan government?
They asked you, didn't they?

43:04.333 --> 43:07.669
They worried Jigen might
catch on that they had her killed,

43:07.670 --> 43:13.174
and that's why they wanted
you to take him down next.

43:13.175 --> 43:17.804
Ridiculous. Why would they want
someone so valuable to them dead?

43:17.805 --> 43:20.619
So they'd have a good
reason to go to war.

43:20.620 --> 43:23.434
They planned to pin
everything on West Doroa

43:23.435 --> 43:27.856
and take all the honor of
East and West for themselves.

43:29.149 --> 43:32.361
You've talked enough. Just kill me.

43:35.280 --> 43:39.993
Unfortunately, I'm not in the habit
of shooting unarmed people.

43:39.994 --> 43:43.622
You obstinate man. This'll go
the same as it did before!

43:43.872 --> 43:45.958
I wonder about that.

43:46.667 --> 43:50.087
Forgive me, but I need
a minute to change clothes.

43:56.802 --> 44:01.056
The same suit again? You're
certainly very particular about it.

44:01.223 --> 44:03.891
You've still got your good taste.

44:03.892 --> 44:08.647
Well, guess I'd better go find out who
the best gunman in the world is after all.

44:25.414 --> 44:29.251
When the next wind dies
down, then it's time.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.150
You bastard!

45:37.444 --> 45:41.530
You've got a lighter gun,
smaller barrel than I do.

45:41.531 --> 45:46.578
Meaning that if our bullets collided,
mine would stay more on course.

45:52.292 --> 46:00.342
Stick to lightweights if you want, but if
you ask me? The feel will never measure up.

46:08.225 --> 46:09.893
Satisfied?

46:10.977 --> 46:13.939
The gunman he was is dead.

46:17.901 --> 46:19.403
Let's go.

46:25.033 --> 46:26.618
Right.

46:31.748 --> 46:35.584
I was amazed to hear how
low the crime rate was here.

46:35.585 --> 46:39.172
Hard to believe it was a breeding
ground for assassination plots.

46:40.674 --> 46:42.843
Would you really leave
me behind like that?

46:42.844 --> 46:45.241
Oh hey, I forgot you were here!

46:45.242 --> 46:47.638
Still a pretty sad story, though.

46:47.639 --> 46:52.185
I think I may have actually felt a
little sad when I thought you died, Jigen.

46:52.186 --> 46:55.939
I couldn't just give the game
away with them listening in, could I?

46:55.940 --> 46:58.816
That wasn't what I was talking about.

46:58.817 --> 47:03.738
Queen Malta only wanted peace,
and her own country killed her for it.

47:03.739 --> 47:06.324
The thoughts of a saint such
as you are just beyond me.

47:06.325 --> 47:08.451
Do you really not get it?

47:08.452 --> 47:10.579
Everyone just loves money.

47:11.163 --> 47:12.538
What? When did you...?

47:12.539 --> 47:13.956
Hope you weren't needing this.

47:13.957 --> 47:17.627
Hey, c'mon! I helped you get
away with that in the first place!

47:18.420 --> 47:21.631
I want half the profits, you hear me?

47:22.424 --> 47:27.304
Just be reasonable. We shouldn't be getting
caught up with her in the first place.

47:27.305 --> 47:29.889
Hope you don't mean that.

47:29.890 --> 47:33.225
Well. Guess that's not
the last we'll see of her.

47:33.226 --> 47:35.020
Daisuke Jigen Ultimate Gun Master Goemon
Ishikawa Master of (ONLY) Swords Training Crazy

47:35.021 --> 47:37.105
Lupin the Third Super-Genius Thief!
Single and looking! What the hell?

47:40.901 --> 47:42.193
Oh well.

47:42.194 --> 47:48.366
Now what was he doing with this? Maybe
he was holding onto it as a present for me.

47:55.749 --> 47:57.584
Can I ask you one thing?

47:57.585 --> 47:58.918
Yeah?

47:58.919 --> 48:03.715
Why'd you tell the media about
Queen Malta's Calamity File?

48:05.091 --> 48:06.510
I just...

48:07.969 --> 48:11.056
You're one to ask. Why
are you in this line of work?

48:14.184 --> 48:17.354
...just wanted a good smoke.

48:17.355 --> 48:19.856
Can't argue with that.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.989
What about you?
You're ok with this?

48:30.367 --> 48:33.537
We're not really friends
of justice ourselves.

48:33.870 --> 48:37.165
It's true. You're just a thief.

48:37.166 --> 48:39.209
And you're just a gunman.

48:48.134 --> 48:49.886
Extra sweet, this one.

48:49.887 --> 48:51.388
Sure is.

48:54.391 --> 48:56.600
<i>This just in:</i>

48:56.601 --> 49:00.939
<i>All countries have announced their intent to
stage military interventions in East Doroa.</i>

49:00.940 --> 49:03.232
<i>It's recently come to light</i>

49:03.233 --> 49:07.821
<i>that the assassination of famous singer
Queen Malta at her concert in West Doroa</i>

49:07.822 --> 49:09.029
<i>was in fact orchestrated by</i>

49:09.030 --> 49:12.825
<i>persons originating from her own home
country of East Doroa, and furthermore,</i>

49:12.826 --> 49:16.329
<i>that East Doroa, who declared war on the West
on the false basis of said assassination,</i>

49:16.330 --> 49:19.039
<i>has been secretly engaged in trading</i>

49:19.040 --> 49:22.627
<i>with the Republic of Malanda
for uranium-enriching facilities.</i>

49:22.628 --> 49:25.797
So they've had a taste
of the forbidden fruit.

49:26.172 --> 49:29.175
<i>The East Doroan government
has so far kept silent-</i>

51:24.999 --> 51:27.335
Inspector? What's going on?

51:31.464 --> 51:32.464
Let's go.

51:32.465 --> 51:33.466
Ah...?

51:34.008 --> 51:36.469
Things are about to get busy.

51:38.513 --> 51:41.850
