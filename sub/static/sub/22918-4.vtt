Very, very fresh.
Full of vitality, thank you.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.320
And we're going to do another one
when we're ready, and...

Colin, chin down a little bit.
Very much down a little bit.

Bloody awful things, weddings.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.800
-Dreadfully upsetting.
-Unless it's one's own, of course.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.920
[Billy] Mm. [exhales]

02:22.200 --> 02:24.080
Another couple off to build a castle.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.200
Lower the portcullis.
Pull up the drawbridge.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.480
-What? How do you mean?
-Couples do that, don't they?

02:31.280 --> 02:34.280
They turn to each other,
and all we see is their backs.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.680
So, what am I to do, Billy?

02:40.720 --> 02:43.160
No one wants to take me on, apparently.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.080
I'm too daunting a prospect.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.840
I could give it a go.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.760
Don't be silly, you're a friend.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.160
Yes, but isn't that the first quality
one should look for in a husband?

02:58.040 --> 02:59.880
In the olden days,
people weren't confused.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.680
People married for sensible reasons.
Marriage was a consolidation of assets.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.240
Also of other things.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.400
-Of friendship and values.
-[scoffs]

03:13.520 --> 03:14.400
Outlooks.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.560
We'd breed derby winners,
have an army of children...

03:22.160 --> 03:24.760
-Billy...
-Look, and I'd know the ropes.

03:25.560 --> 03:30.080
I know the rules. Your family all know me,
and I think are not averse.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.960
-Oh, they adore you.
-And I you.

03:36.840 --> 03:37.720
Always have.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.000
I'm your Old Faithful, after all.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.160

04:13.520 --> 04:16.079
[Elizabeth]  Mummy said something
interesting the other day.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.000
-Oh?
-[sighs]

04:19.720 --> 04:23.480
She said that the first ten years
of marriage are just an overture.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.920
That there's often a crisis at ten years,
but then you work it out and settle in...

04:33.200 --> 04:36.560
and it's only then
that it really gets into its stride.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.760
Oh.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.640
Do you suppose
that's what's happened to us?

04:45.120 --> 04:46.000
Possibly.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.320
I was thinking, perhaps we should have
a big anniversary party this year.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.920
To celebrate hitting our stride.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.200
All right.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.440
[phone rings]

05:12.840 --> 05:13.680
Yes?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.720
All right. [mouths] It's Margaret.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.120
[Elizabeth on phone]  So how was it?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.040
It somehow managed to lift the spirits

05:24.120 --> 05:26.760
and make one want to kill oneself
in equal measure.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.040
Took forever to get there.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.240
-Mummy was a nightmare.
-Was she?

05:31.320 --> 05:34.800
Mercifully, they sent a helicopter
to bring us back. [chuckles]

05:34.880 --> 05:35.720
Hmm.

05:37.400 --> 05:42.240
And I have this horrible feeling
that somewhere, in the middle of it all...

05:45.040 --> 05:50.000
-I agreed to get married myself.
-What?

05:50.720 --> 05:54.080
-To whom?
-Billy Wallace.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.960
Goodness!

05:56.800 --> 05:59.120
Congratulations! [mouths] Billy Wallace.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.960
Oh, Christ!

06:04.040 --> 06:10.880
So if I were to accept,
it would be a yes from you?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.600
Yes, of course.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.120
An emphatic yes.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.280
And Philip and I
were just discussing having a party

06:19.360 --> 06:21.280
for our tenth wedding anniversary,

06:21.600 --> 06:25.000
and you and Billy could use the occasion
to announce your engagement,

06:25.080 --> 06:26.120
if you wanted.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.920
That's a nice idea.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.520
Well, that's settled then.  [inhales]

06:32.600 --> 06:36.520
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Goodnight, Margaret.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.440
[line clicks]

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
[exhales deeply]

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
[man on television]
...perhaps you'd explain why it is

08:12.080 --> 08:14.480
that the satellite
keeps on circling the Earth

08:14.560 --> 08:17.440
instead of either flying off into space
or dropping to the ground.

08:17.520 --> 08:21.800
I'm not sure how I feel about
a Russian satellite circling the Earth...

08:22.760 --> 08:25.120
just above our heads.
What's it doing up there?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.440
Notionally, it's providing information

08:27.520 --> 08:29.920
about the density
of the Earth's upper atmosphere.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.240
Of course its darker purpose
is to demonstrate to everyone

08:34.320 --> 08:36.440
the extent of Russian military power

08:36.520 --> 08:39.240
-and technical capacity.
-Oh.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.800
The same rocket
that launched this satellite

08:40.880 --> 08:43.040
is capable of firing a nuclear warhead

08:43.120 --> 08:46.320
into enemy territory
with pinpoint accuracy.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.280
-Wow.
-[Macmillan] Imagine the effect

08:48.360 --> 08:49.680
this will have on the Americans.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.240
A great crisis of self-doubt,
if I'm not very much mistaken.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.440
We must seize this opportunity
to help the Americans

08:57.520 --> 09:00.440
and work together in a joint effort
to meet the Russian threat.

09:00.520 --> 09:05.280
That is the way to repair Anglo-American
relations, which, as you know,

09:05.360 --> 09:10.520
have deteriorated terribly
due to the Suez Crisis.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.880
Quite. You know,
after the war they said Eisen--

09:13.960 --> 09:17.680
[Macmillan] I am absolutely determined
to restore the special relationship

09:17.760 --> 09:19.480
that exists between our two countries.

09:19.560 --> 09:24.440
We're bound by so much more
than just language and shared history.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.120
It's a kind of marriage.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.760
As in any marriage,
there'll be ups and downs,

09:30.840 --> 09:34.600
but one must work
to get things back on track.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.360
They say that listening's important.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.000
In any marriage.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.800
[man on television]  Does that mean
that we can learn just as much

09:45.880 --> 09:47.520
from this satellite as the Russians?

09:47.600 --> 09:50.280
[birds chirping]

09:57.880 --> 09:59.240
And how are we going to do this?

10:00.040 --> 10:03.680
I think the driver should drop me first,
then take you on to the station.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.120
Or I could wait.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.920
I don't think that would be wise.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.680
Why? How long do you need with him?

10:15.680 --> 10:19.160
A day. Maybe two.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.120
It's the last time, I promise.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.120
-Don't make promises you cannot keep.
-[Dorothy] No.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.480
I'm determined to end it. It's time.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.800
-Now that you're Prime Minister.
-Yes, it is.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.360
[thunder crashing]

11:08.040 --> 11:10.480
-[Beaton] With a one, two, three, flash.
-[camera shutter clicks]

11:10.560 --> 11:12.360
Oh, quite magnificent.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.360
Why does it always have to be
Cecil Beaton

11:15.440 --> 11:18.360
-taking my official birthday portrait?
-What's wrong with Cecil?

11:18.720 --> 11:22.280
When it came out last year,
everyone said how pretty you looked.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.640
No, they said how much I looked like you.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.240
Well, quite.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.440
Cecil does just one thing: fairy tales.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.800
Yes, but he does it so well.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.920
And to me, Your Royal Highness.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.080
A little less chin, and..

11:38.760 --> 11:39.760
[camera shutter clicks]

11:40.440 --> 11:41.640
What do you think?

11:42.400 --> 11:44.360
I asked my new lady-in-waiting
here today...

11:44.440 --> 11:45.440
Your Majesty.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.200
...to offer her opinion...

11:48.400 --> 11:50.920
having at least one foot
in the real world.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.240
I think birthday portraits
should evolve and mature with age.

11:55.320 --> 11:59.840
Like the subject. Show change
in the character. Complexity.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.440
Reality.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.120
No one wants complexity
and reality from us.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.160
-[Beaton laughs]
-Do sit down.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.920
People have enough of that
in their own lives.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.480
-They want us to help them escape.
-Indeed, Your Majesty.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.960
Imagine this, if you will...

12:20.880 --> 12:25.680
a young woman, a commonplace creature.
She sits in her drab little scullery.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.560
So much work to do. So much washing-up.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.320
How she longs for comfort, for hope.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.040
-And again. One, two, three and flash.
-[camera shutter clicks]

12:37.560 --> 12:42.000
She wants to believe
her life has some meaning beyond chores.

12:42.080 --> 12:46.600
She opens a magazine and she sees
Her Royal Highness's photograph.

12:47.160 --> 12:53.160
For one glorious, transforming moment,
she becomes a princess, too.

12:53.240 --> 12:58.440
She is lifted out of her miserable,
pitiful reality into a fantasy.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.840
Later, she will step out of her house

13:05.920 --> 13:11.120
in a new neckerchief, perhaps,
for which she has saved.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.160
Oh, she will hold her head up high.
She is renewed.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.520
And all thanks to you,
Your Royal Highness...

13:19.600 --> 13:23.200
and to the ideal which you represent.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.440
And now,

may be indisposed this evening.

We're announcing our engagement.

Billy?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.200
It's all right, Simpson.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.800
Well, what's going on?
It's our announcement this evening.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.720
[door closes]

Are you drunk?

15:36.120 --> 15:39.280
Don't be like that.
I had to do something for the pain.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.920
-Well, what happened?
-[Billy] Wait till you hear.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.880
You'll laugh till you spit.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.960
Your friend Tennant rather took offense
at something I did.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.720
You came to blows with Colin?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.880
I believe the word "duel" was mentioned.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.680
A duel?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.120
[Billy]  Tennant issued the challenge.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.360
A little childish in this day and age
if you ask me,

15:58.440 --> 16:00.560
but a duel is a duel,
so I stepped up to the mark.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.120
[Billy whimpering]

16:03.200 --> 16:04.560
That's what a gentleman does.

No!

16:09.560 --> 16:10.400

16:10.480 --> 16:14.200
[Billy] If I'm completely honest, a little
drink had been taken during the night.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.760
But we faced the dawn
with clear heads and strong hearts.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.600
[sniveling]

16:20.680 --> 16:24.560
Now, Tennant wanted to motor up to Glen
to get his father's old pistols.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.920
It would've been quite ridiculous.
Much too far away.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.400
So, Blandford offered his.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.280
[Billy sniveling] It was a bloody
stupid mistake.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.240
A duel is not just
a test of marksmanship.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.200
It's a test of character.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.640
Ten paces.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.320
One... two...

16:43.960 --> 16:46.080
three... four...

16:47.080 --> 16:49.480
five... six...

16:50.080 --> 16:54.760
seven... eight... nine...

16:54.840 --> 16:55.760
ten.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.080
[guns fire]

16:58.360 --> 17:01.160
Fucker shot me in the leg.
Bloody awful thing.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.280
Anyway, I survived
with a small flesh wound.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.320
And why was he angry with you?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.920
It's the strangest thing, but ever since
word got out about our engagement,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.840
I've found myself
quite the center of attention.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
It's as though
every good-looking girl on Earth

17:18.480 --> 17:21.040
[laughs] has taken the news
as a personal challenge.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.640
I'm not used to the idea of being a beau,
much less a catch.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.560
Seems to have gone to my head rather.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.160
-Had a bit of a fumble at Blenheim.
-[sighs]

17:32.240 --> 17:35.760
She was rather a beauty.
She's in pictures, you know. An actress.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.160
Anyway, Tennant got wind of it
and got very cross.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.920
Yes, with reason.

17:50.960 --> 17:55.600
You pathetic, weak, contemptible fool.

17:57.640 --> 18:02.640
I never even wanted to marry you.
You were only ever an act of charity.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.400
Or desperation.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.000
And now you insult me? You?

18:08.840 --> 18:12.160
People like you don't get to insult people
like me. You get to be eternally grateful.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.800
You've quite the way with women.

18:19.280 --> 18:24.160
Take a look at this face.
A picture of disappointment and disgust.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.280
This is the look that every woman
you ever know will come to share.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.760
This is what the next 40 years
of your life will look like.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.560
Margaret...

18:44.440 --> 18:45.400
-[door opens]
-Margaret!

18:45.480 --> 18:47.120
-[footsteps]
-Shit!

18:47.200 --> 18:49.840
[chattering]

19:00.160 --> 19:01.680
Ma'am, I've been asked to tell you

19:01.760 --> 19:05.560
that Princess Margaret will not be
announcing the engagement this evening.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.680
Her Royal Highness said
she'll explain everything later.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.480
Yes, I'm sure she will.
Thank you, Michael.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.560
[Adeane] Thank you, ma'am.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.920
[guests laughing]

19:33.000 --> 19:34.720
All right, all right, settle down.

19:35.080 --> 19:40.760
So on my recent tour of the Pacific,
I was introduced to a man who said to me,

19:41.480 --> 19:45.440
"My wife is a doctor of philosophy
and much more important than I am."

19:45.520 --> 19:46.880
[laughs]

19:47.560 --> 19:49.720
To which I could only reply,

19:49.800 --> 19:52.160
"Ah, yes, sir, we have that trouble
in our family too."

19:52.240 --> 19:53.360
[all laughing]

19:56.760 --> 19:59.480
You know, when I imagined our marriage
in the early days,

19:59.560 --> 20:04.920
I imagined two people welded together
into some sort of combined existence.

20:06.200 --> 20:13.120
Ten years. Ten years has taught me
the secret of a successful marriage

20:13.200 --> 20:15.680
is actually to have different interests.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.640
Well, different interests,
but not entirely different.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.760
[all laughing]

20:25.120 --> 20:26.560
It's a funny business.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.240
One sees the whole of the other person,
you see even that part of them

20:31.320 --> 20:32.960
that they don't see themselves,

20:33.040 --> 20:36.840
and presumably...
they see that hidden part of you.

20:39.240 --> 20:44.000
One ends up knowing more about one's
partner than they know about themselves.

20:44.920 --> 20:49.360
And it can be pretty tough
to keep quiet about it. So you have to...

20:49.920 --> 20:52.040
You have to come to an accommodation,

20:52.320 --> 20:56.840
an arrangement, a deal... if you like,

20:56.920 --> 20:58.800
to take the rough with the smooth.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.520
But the extraordinary thing is...

21:06.160 --> 21:07.560
down there in the rough...

21:08.520 --> 21:11.680
in the long reeds of difficulty
and pain...

21:14.640 --> 21:16.440
that is where you find the treasure.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.520
So I would like to propose a toast...

21:23.800 --> 21:25.000
in the name of love.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.400
In the name of our beloved country.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.200
In the name of steadfastness.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.560
In the name
of another ten marvelous years.

President Eisenhower has spoken warmly
of the special relationship

and the United States.

I just can't.
I can't have him touch me, be near me.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.960
Good morning!

26:03.440 --> 26:05.520
Oh, darling, what a mess. [laughs]

26:06.160 --> 26:11.280
It is the most beautiful day.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.120
I've brought something to cheer you up.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.640
Cecil's magnificent work.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.480
He's quite outdone himself this time.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.320
I can tell you which one I would choose
as the official birthday portrait,

26:28.840 --> 26:31.280
and Cecil immediately agreed.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.840
But of course, it's for you to decide.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.920
And with regards to Billy Wallace--

27:09.000 --> 27:10.880
Don't mention that name.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.240
I've had him
on the telephone to me all morning,

-Then his mother, then his grandmother--
-I'm never speaking to him again.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.440
Then we will find you someone else.

I don't want you to find me anyone.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.560

but we won't hold that against him.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.120
I do know what the official duties
of a lady-in-waiting are.

Accompanying me on foreign trips,
dealing with my mail.

Do you suppose it might also include
helping me climb over the wall to escape?

I just can't bear it anymore.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.160
[Cavendish]  Yes, they're all normal.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.960
But in their own way,
they're all quite exceptional, too.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.320
[Margaret] You can go.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.920
[Cavendish]  And possibly not deferential.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.800

they still meet the main requirements.

seem to know one another very well."

30:09.440 --> 30:10.280
Hmm?

30:15.320 --> 30:17.480
Then you'd be absolutely right.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.200
Now, be honest.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.600
Can you remember any of the names?

No, not really.

Can't remember me either?

We have.

Perhaps it'll come to you.

Now, where to begin...

Ah. Far corner.

-Irresistible?
-Oh, come on, a nine, surely?

-Oh, she's an eight.
-Isn't she?

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
Yes, they dazzle in public, those two.

31:05.320 --> 31:09.160
They don't disappoint in private either.
More of that another time, I think.

-Yes. [exhales]

33:15.040 --> 33:16.200
Portraits?

33:16.280 --> 33:20.200
Mm, I don't like that word.
It's so stuffy and traditional.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.200
Oh, sorry. What are they, then?

33:24.080 --> 33:28.920
Mm, people, faces. They're the most
interesting subject I've found so far.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.840
If you can think of anything
more interesting, do let me know.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.040
Oh, I like them.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.680
It's as if there's no camera at all.
You've caught them off guard.

33:42.760 --> 33:46.760
-Ah, it's all luck, really.
-You've made the ugliness beautiful.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.360
I despise posturing
and pretentiousness and humbug.

33:51.880 --> 33:52.760
Don't you?

33:54.680 --> 33:56.920
Is that why you took up photography?

33:58.120 --> 33:58.960
Maybe.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.760
Maybe it's just a good way
to get behind closed doors.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.920
-[Margaret] Somebody's door in particular?
-Just doors generally.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.400
A facade is only useful as a marker

34:08.480 --> 34:10.639
for something one has to get behind
or beyond.

34:10.720 --> 34:14.600
The surface is so dreary, don't you think?
What people want to show of themselves,

34:14.680 --> 34:17.080
the idealized version,
is of no interest to me.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.960
What people hide... that interests me.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.560
But you get so close.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.640
Isn't it rather an intrusion?

34:31.520 --> 34:35.000
It's very much an intrusion, yes.
That's exactly what photography is.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.360
I use a small Leica, nothing fancy,

34:38.440 --> 34:41.400
and natural light,
which means that I can prowl around.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.320
All the while
I'm getting closer and closer,

34:44.400 --> 34:45.960
and in the end, it's kind of like...

34:46.680 --> 34:49.080
-Well, it's, uh...
-Intrusion.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.560
Intimacy.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.240
[jazz music playing]

35:12.640 --> 35:14.680
[Margaret] How would you feel
about taking my photograph?

35:14.760 --> 35:16.040
[Tony] Well, I'd consider it.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.640
On one condition.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.760
-Go on.
-When you come to my slum studio,

35:23.840 --> 35:26.320
you leave the titles and princess outside.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.400
-[scoffs] I'd be happy to.
-And for the duration of the session,

35:30.240 --> 35:31.800
you do everything I say.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.160
Don't look like that.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.920
You're dying to, admit it.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.080
Dying to what?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.400
Be a supplicant.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.560
I can tell.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.600
[Margaret]  It was the first room
I've ever been to where nobody got up,

35:55.000 --> 35:56.920
bowed, curtsied.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.400
Some just carried on having conversations,
as if I wasn't there at all.

36:00.960 --> 36:04.200
Those that did talk to me
did with such indifference

36:04.280 --> 36:09.600
or nonchalance, it verged on impertinence.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.360
There was this one in particular.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.920
-Tony.
-Anthony, surely?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.360
[Margaret] No, he insisted.

36:16.440 --> 36:20.720
Tony. Armstrong-Jones.
He's this photographer.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.400
-Like Cecil?
-Oh, no, nothing like Cecil.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.040
Couldn't be less like Cecil.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.040
Well, maybe a bit like Cecil,
in that he's obviously queer.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.960
Though interestingly, Elizabeth denies it.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.200
Elizabeth who?

36:32.640 --> 36:36.120
Cavendish. I called her when I got home
last night and interrogated her.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.680
"What are the five most important things
I need to know about that man?"

36:39.760 --> 36:42.880
-Why five?
-I don't know. Felt like the right number.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.440
-[Elizabeth] Why not three?
-He's more interesting than three.

36:47.480 --> 36:48.880
[Elizabeth] So, what did she say?

36:49.520 --> 36:50.880
One, that he's Welsh.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.480
-Is that interesting?
-[Margaret] No, not particularly.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.480
That he had polio as a child.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.800
That he has a passion
for inventing things.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.960
And he would never dream of being
anything as straightforward

37:03.040 --> 37:04.320
as "simply queer."

37:04.400 --> 37:05.880
What on earth does that mean?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.760
I'm not altogether sure.

37:08.680 --> 37:12.240
But I'm also not incurious to find out.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.000
[Elizabeth]  What was number five?

37:14.080 --> 37:14.960
[Margaret] You can go.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.800
- That was five.
-[Elizabeth]  No, Margaret, that was four.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.320
[Margaret]  All right. Five is...

37:21.320 --> 37:22.440
I liked him.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.240
Yes, I can tell that.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.920
-There's a contempt in him.
-What for?

37:32.440 --> 37:34.880
For me. For us.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.440
For everything we represent.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.640
I actually think you'd like him.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.000
That's what's so dangerous about him.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.600
[Tony] Upstairs.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.480
[footsteps approaching]

38:22.720 --> 38:24.200
[exhales]

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
[Tony] Right.

38:32.680 --> 38:33.600
Wait there.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.760
[Tony whistling]

38:38.520 --> 38:39.520
Back in a minute.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.240
[banging]

39:02.000 --> 39:04.080
[floorboards creaking]

39:07.840 --> 39:09.360
[banging]

39:13.360 --> 39:15.920
[footsteps]

39:27.960 --> 39:29.080
[exhales]

39:36.640 --> 39:38.840
[wheels rattling]

39:52.480 --> 39:56.560
[loud banging]

40:20.480 --> 40:21.320
[sighs]

40:47.520 --> 40:49.160
[camera winding]

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
[Margaret exhales]

40:55.160 --> 40:56.960
[camera clicking, winding]

41:05.600 --> 41:06.600
[camera shutter clicks]

41:10.960 --> 41:12.200
Don't smile like that.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.000
It's lovely, but don't.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.960
-Too lovely?
-[camera winding]

41:19.720 --> 41:22.240
-For my taste, yes.
-Oh, I see.

41:22.320 --> 41:25.320
-[camera shutter clicks]
-You'd prefer me to be unlovely?

41:25.400 --> 41:26.400
[camera winding]

41:26.480 --> 41:30.240
I'd prefer you to be yourself. Though
I realize that's asking the impossible.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.760
Why?

41:32.920 --> 41:34.720
Because I'm uncooperative?

41:35.280 --> 41:37.280
-Because you have no idea who you are.
-[camera shutter clicks]

41:37.360 --> 41:38.840
-Look to the window.
-[camera winding]

41:38.920 --> 41:41.960
-I know perfectly well.
-No, not the faintest idea.

41:43.640 --> 41:44.480
Window.

41:48.760 --> 41:49.600
[camera shutter clicks]

41:56.520 --> 41:57.840
We don't know who you are, either.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.160
The rest of us, outside the palace gates.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.480
That's because we keep feeding you
the fairy tale.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.840
[camera shutter clicks]

42:07.000 --> 42:08.240
[camera winding]

42:12.800 --> 42:13.640
Like this.

42:20.680 --> 42:21.560
Ah.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.120
Jesus.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.760
I'm sorry, but, uh...

42:28.400 --> 42:29.240
[photo falls]

42:29.760 --> 42:31.440
Cecil is a disgrace.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.120
Well, he's been good to the family.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.320
Why would you care about the family?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.800
Have they been good to you?

42:46.080 --> 42:47.200
They're my family.

42:49.080 --> 42:49.920
Yes.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.280
[camera shutter clicks]

42:54.920 --> 42:56.120
[camera winding]

42:56.200 --> 42:58.320
But that business with Peter Townsend.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.200
Cruel.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.640
Was he really as dreary as he seemed?

43:12.120 --> 43:13.120
[camera shutter clicks]

43:14.880 --> 43:18.240
-[camera winding]
-He was decent and old-fashioned.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.280
Easy qualities to mock.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.360
[camera shutter clicks]

43:26.920 --> 43:28.400
[camera winding]

43:30.920 --> 43:32.520
Easy to miss, too.

44:13.920 --> 44:14.920
Do you miss him?

44:25.200 --> 44:26.080
Sometimes.

44:27.320 --> 44:28.160
[camera shutter clicks]

44:29.520 --> 44:33.320
[Tony] Got it. Right.
Back to my place for a drink?

44:33.400 --> 44:34.400
[Margaret exhales]

44:35.040 --> 44:39.880
-Your place? Where's that?
-Well, get dressed and I'll show you.

44:44.120 --> 44:44.960
[sighs]

44:45.040 --> 44:46.880
[Tony whistling]

44:53.880 --> 44:55.880
[footsteps approaching]

44:59.200 --> 45:03.200
So, this is... home.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.560
Oh, it's marvelous.

45:13.200 --> 45:17.520
-[Tony] Whiskey or Cinzano?
-Whiskey, please.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.400
[glasses clink]

45:22.200 --> 45:24.280
[whiskey pouring]

45:26.920 --> 45:27.880
Who's she?

45:30.960 --> 45:33.920
-[Tony] A friend.
-What kind of friend?

45:34.720 --> 45:35.560
A friend.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.920
And this one? Ooh.
Couldn't you have cheered her up a little?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.600
That's Sarah Macmillan,
the Prime Minister's daughter.

45:44.160 --> 45:45.120
Or is she?

45:46.040 --> 45:47.320
Word is not.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.720
-That she's Bob Boothby's love child.
-No.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.680
Mm. Thirty years they say
the affair's been going on,

45:54.760 --> 45:56.720
right under the PM's nose.
Can you imagine?

45:59.680 --> 46:01.720
I don't think I'm ever
going to get married.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.080
Quite right.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.560
Ghastly business.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.320
It makes being happy so very difficult.

46:16.760 --> 46:17.760
Oh, what's this?

46:18.920 --> 46:21.400
Oh, it's something I'm working on.
A design.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.600
It's fragile, get off.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.040
Mm, sorry.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.160
[Tony chuckles]

46:29.800 --> 46:32.960
Here, come and have a look at this.
This might amuse you.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.600
-What, people have signed their names?
-Well, their nicknames, yes.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.160
-Who's Tigger?
-Cleo Laine.

46:51.160 --> 46:53.600
-Snitch?
-Dirk Bogarde.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.200
[gasps] Oh, look.
You already have a princess.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.120
[Tony] Mm.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.560
That's Tony Richardson.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.080
Will you sign?

47:05.640 --> 47:07.320
I keep a diamond for the purpose.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.440
Go on.

47:10.440 --> 47:12.480
I'm not sure I've ever had a nickname.

47:13.640 --> 47:14.600
What shall I put?

47:15.760 --> 47:17.960
Something that'll
throw them off the scent.

47:19.040 --> 47:19.880
Beryl.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.120
-Beryl?
-Mm.

47:23.720 --> 47:24.560
All right.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.560
It rhymes with peril.

47:48.960 --> 47:49.960
Put it back.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.200
Right.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.680
-Shall we look at the photograph?
-Yes.

48:45.000 --> 48:45.840
[clicks]

48:55.840 --> 48:56.680
Right.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.760
First...

49:14.280 --> 49:15.240
the chemicals.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.320
-[Margaret] You know, when we first met...
-Mm?

49:31.960 --> 49:33.760
...I was sure you were queer.

49:41.840 --> 49:42.680
Why?

49:44.240 --> 49:45.960
Just the way you talked to women.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.760
Understood women.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.920
Then you put it into the water.

50:06.160 --> 50:07.840
-Here?
-Mm-hmm.

50:11.360 --> 50:15.920
Not to mention your tidy little hips,
your vanity and fastidiousness.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.280
I'm not vain.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.960
You're insufferably vain.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.840
But now I see you're not queer.

50:29.960 --> 50:33.040
Then you put it into the fixer.

50:38.960 --> 50:42.440
This whole routine
is far too practiced and well oiled.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.720
Woman after woman has been here
before me.

50:49.440 --> 50:50.880
Beautiful women.

50:52.040 --> 50:52.920
[Tony] Mm-hmm.

50:54.000 --> 50:54.840
Then...

51:01.520 --> 51:02.480
we hang her up.

51:14.760 --> 51:15.680
What do you think?

51:20.080 --> 51:22.040
It's a Margaret I've never seen before.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.960
-No one's ever seen before.
-No.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.160
Because in this photo,
you're not a princess anymore.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.440
There's someone
I would like you to send it to.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.880
Can I give you an address?

51:46.320 --> 51:47.160
Sure.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.120
-Then I must go.
-Mm.

51:54.640 --> 51:55.680
You, um...

51:57.280 --> 51:58.840
You won't stay a little longer?

52:00.360 --> 52:01.560
No.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.920
This is where the routine ends.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.160
For now.

52:09.120 --> 52:09.960
All right.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.800
Did you come with a driver?

52:13.720 --> 52:15.840
[Margaret] Yes, he's waiting outside.

52:16.560 --> 52:17.960
Good. Then he can follow us.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.400
[speaking Malaysian]

52:36.640 --> 52:39.040
[interpreter] We are most honored
to have been guests

52:39.120 --> 52:41.600
-in Your Majesty's beautiful home.
-Ah.

52:41.920 --> 52:45.000
[speaking Malaysian]

52:49.880 --> 52:52.720
[motorcycle revving]

52:53.320 --> 52:54.320
Hold tight.

52:56.360 --> 52:58.080
-[tires screeching]
-[horn honks]

53:10.800 --> 53:13.680
