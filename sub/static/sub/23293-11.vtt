00:12.040 --> 00:14.560
SUNDAY
7:02 PM

00:37.360 --> 00:40.120
57 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

00:41.840 --> 00:43.400
The pharmacy has been robbed.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.120
"They took the record books.
I have no idea how it’s happened.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.240
Only you and I knew about it!"

00:50.920 --> 00:53.000
"Do you know that moment
you tie loose ends

00:53.160 --> 00:54.440
that you didn’t want to tie?

00:55.320 --> 00:56.760
It’s painful, isn’t it?

00:57.720 --> 01:00.080
You’re there with your long time partner
and you think:

01:00.600 --> 01:02.280
'What a fucking bastard'."

01:02.360 --> 01:03.400
I’m on my way there.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.280
"Or: 'What a bitch'.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.800
You refuse to believe it,
but you know there’s a betrayer.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.160
And it can only be you or your partner.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.600
And Ángel knew it wasn’t him.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.080
Raquel was trying to find
an explanation to that,

01:19.880 --> 01:21.760
but when explanations don’t come alone,

01:22.600 --> 01:25.040
there’s always someone
willing to push you a bit."

01:25.480 --> 01:27.800
I’m old-fashioned and still believe
in the good and bad guys.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.960
And I am completely sure
that you are of the good ones.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.520
Could you stand up for the detective?

01:37.040 --> 01:38.800
Because I wouldn’t.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.960
"Ángel thought nothing worse could happen,

01:50.600 --> 01:51.680
but it could.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.360
Sure it could.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.720
When you hit rock bottom,

02:01.280 --> 02:03.720
there’s still something
before the edge of the abyss."

02:27.440 --> 02:28.920
Soil!

02:33.200 --> 02:34.040
What's the matter?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.440
What’s the matter, Moscow?

02:39.600 --> 02:40.720
We have it!

02:41.440 --> 02:43.160
We have it, mate!

02:43.240 --> 02:46.920
"It wasn’t dark yet that Sunday evening,
when we were in a very euphoric mood.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.400
We had found soil

02:49.640 --> 02:52.080
and Nairobi had the printing presses
working at full capacity.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.800
There was over 400 million euros.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.080
We had sealed the entries
with explosives.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.360
And had the feeling
of being inside a bunker.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.840
It was our ten minutes of glory."

03:19.840 --> 03:22.800
Who wants the sound of the sea?
This is like poetry for our ears.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.000
This is the heart of the world
beating right here.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.120
400 MILLION EUROS

03:26.200 --> 03:27.560
Because we’re making it beat.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.040
Because the world moves because of this.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.000
What’s all this celebrating
you’re doing here? What’s the matter?

03:53.880 --> 03:55.040
What’s wrong with you?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.360
Hoorah!

04:20.360 --> 04:23.200
"Undoubtedly, that was the happiest
moment for us inside there.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.640
Then, we relaxed."

05:41.040 --> 05:41.920
Don’t move.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.960
Do you want to comb your hair?

05:52.280 --> 05:53.120
Thank you.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.960
Do you know how we say back home
"two men make love"?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.480
We say "comb inside".

06:15.760 --> 06:16.720
Sorry.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.000
With all the medication
I have an upset stomach.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.320
-Could I use the toilet?
-Sure, mate.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.240
Thank you.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.280
Jacinto.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.640
Jacinto, it’s Arturo, can you hear me?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.280
Jacinto.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.360
Mr Arturo.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
You’re alive.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.920
I was convinced you had been shot.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.280
I didn’t sleep a wink.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.880
We are in the basement with the boilers,
chained like dogs.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.040
We’re locked up
with the four police officers.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.480
We only come up here to use the toilet.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.760
Listen up, Jacinto.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.120
I’ve got a pair of scissors
and I can get hold of more tools.

07:19.280 --> 07:23.480
Screwdrivers, a hand saw, I don’t know.
I can give them to you in two hours.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.240
-Have you got a watch on you?
-Yes.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.600
Make up any excuse.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.080
Try to make them bring you here again,
in two hours,

07:29.160 --> 07:32.080
from now on.
Remember, the second on the left.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.680
I’ll leave them there.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.920
What will we do
with a pair of scissors and a hand saw?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.880
Those people have explosives,
M-16, and all sorts of things.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.240
67 people’s lives are in your hands.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.480
Believe me, it will work out fine, and
in a few hours no more nightmare for us.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.200
All right.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.240
Move, move.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.800
Yes, yes, coming.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.760
The pictures sent by the kidnappers

08:14.920 --> 08:18.280
show explosives
connected to photoelectric cells.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.000
They have been placed in all the entries,

08:22.760 --> 08:25.400
even in the underground ventilation ducts.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.920
-What kind of explosive are they using?
-The bomb squad think it’s C-4.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.440
But I can see they’re more orange,

08:31.520 --> 08:33.960
so we sent them out to the scientific
support branch to be verified.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.680
-Who in the scientific branch?
-We sent them out to Alberto.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.600
There’s no other inspector
in the scientific brunch

08:43.680 --> 08:45.760
who does the same job as my ex-husband?

08:45.960 --> 08:48.120
It was sent out to Alberto
because he’s the best.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.200
It’s a direct order
from superintendent Sánchez.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.120
I see.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.240
-What do the scientific branch say it is?
-They think it’s P-4.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.280
Very similar to C-4, British origin,
and that the connexion is perfect.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.680
They’re making it difficult for us,
aren’t they?

09:16.520 --> 09:17.440
"Alison!"

09:26.920 --> 09:30.760
I think it’s time I had
a friendly chat with Alison Parker.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.360
REPEATER ACTIVATED

09:38.440 --> 09:39.240
Colonel.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.520
There’s an incoming cell phone call
from inside the building.

09:49.080 --> 09:49.920
Record it.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.160
It’s from Jun Li, a hostage.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.560
"It’s Aníbal Cortés.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.600
What do you want?"

10:04.040 --> 10:05.520
To help you, Aníbal.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.840
In order to do so, we need
you to help us get inside the Fábrica

10:10.200 --> 10:14.080
and get the hostages out
in the least aggressive way possible.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.160
There’s plastic explosive
in all the entries.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.120
Yes, coming in is no problem, but...

10:26.080 --> 10:27.600
we need an ally.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.400
"An ally who can tell us
where the robbers are at every minute."

10:31.880 --> 10:34.760
I see, and why would I sell
my partners out to you?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.280
They will tempt you with a better future,

10:37.360 --> 10:40.840
a prison sentence reduction,
that in one or two years you’ll be out.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.960
If you help us,
you’ll be eligible for parole,

10:44.120 --> 10:46.640
a reduction in you prison sentence
to two years.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.960
"You’ll have a new future ahead of you
by the age of 22. Think it over."

10:54.920 --> 10:56.920
Divide and conquer, that’s the motto.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.880
It worked for a small town in Italy
to take control of the whole world.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.160
It worked for Napoleon later,

11:05.680 --> 11:08.040
and now it’s working for the Police.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.480
They’ll use the slightest contact

11:12.800 --> 11:14.480
to tempt any of you.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.920
After 48 hours inside
the pressure will start sinking in,

11:23.320 --> 11:25.720
anguish, negativism.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.400
And it will be then, when they’ll try
to aim for the weakest link.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.200
"There isn’t weakness in us.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.200
There is in those outside."

11:36.280 --> 11:38.600
"It’s not too late, honey."

11:40.920 --> 11:42.520
By the time they attempt to contact,

11:42.600 --> 11:44.960
you’ll have committed six
or eight crimes, at least.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.600
No judge can guarantee you
walking free, none.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.120
Once inside, the only one
who can guarantee you being free

11:53.920 --> 11:54.960
it’s me.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.000
Aníbal, listen to me carefully.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.160
"The judge guarantees you being free
in a very short time."

12:11.280 --> 12:13.840
Okay, let’s square up
the numbers, inspector.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.000
Let’s see, aggravated robbery:

12:17.880 --> 12:19.080
from two to five years.

12:19.800 --> 12:23.400
"Hostage taking and setting conditions

12:23.480 --> 12:26.960
for the release of four escort
police officers: 40 years."

12:27.480 --> 12:29.200
Hacking the alarm system, computer crime,

12:29.280 --> 12:31.880
we’re talking about
six months up to two years.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.160
Public order offence
for breaking in the Fábrica:

12:35.240 --> 12:36.640
one to six years.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.080
And with the hostages
It’s much more difficult.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.720
67 hostages.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.520
The law says that it can be from six up
to ten years for each kidnapping.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.560
Then, it’s the point-blank shooting
at the police on the first day:

12:49.440 --> 12:51.560
from six to eight years for each officer.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.720
But they were wounded too,
which is an offence causing injury

12:55.880 --> 12:56.920
"an aggravating circumstance

12:57.000 --> 12:59.040
that adds eight years
for each injured police officer."

12:59.200 --> 13:02.320
We are talking about,
if we have a tough judge,

13:02.400 --> 13:04.520
723 years

13:04.880 --> 13:08.080
the prosecution will ask for.
The shortest sentence you can be offered

13:08.440 --> 13:12.400
by the judge and the prosecution, without
using the penal code as toilet paper...

13:12.760 --> 13:14.960
"It’s 173 years.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.680
Don’t let them fool you."

13:17.280 --> 13:20.120
The penal code is the rules
of the game of any country.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.840
No one can break them, no one.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.400
There’s one thing
we can actually agree with.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.560
The presidential pardon.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Tell him yes.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.480
You want me to ask the president
for a presidential pardon?

13:41.640 --> 13:44.480
No, I want you to ask the president
to be on TV

13:44.560 --> 13:47.800
and in front of the whole Spain,
say that if any of the kidnappers

13:47.880 --> 13:51.720
decide to cooperate to end this crisis,
the possibility of offering them

13:51.880 --> 13:54.160
"a pardon in exchange
for their cooperation will be studied.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.200
First, the president
will be in the news report."

13:57.280 --> 13:58.960
-He’s bluffing.
-"After that, I’ll consider the option

13:59.040 --> 14:01.880
-of being a fucking rat."
-Very good, we’ll do it.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.680
But for that to happen we need
a gesture of goodwill from you.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.880
Tell us the name of the Professor

14:10.600 --> 14:12.640
and how many robbers there are inside.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.160
I think we have to go along with him.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.520
"Come on, Aníbal,
give me a name and a number,

14:18.600 --> 14:21.440
and I can assure you
you will have a future again."

14:22.720 --> 14:23.560
Okay.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.520
A name and a number.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.360
"Get a piece of paper and a pen”.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.160
My bollocks 33!

14:34.720 --> 14:36.160
What a son of a bitch.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.360
Fuck.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.120
Attention, we cut off all communication
with the Fábrica.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.600
What the hell did you do?

14:47.920 --> 14:50.760
You screwed up any chance
of buying us some more time.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.160
They didn’t buy it, okay?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.520
I could hear the bloody murmuring,
for fuck’s sake.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.240
Let’s see, who do you think you are?

14:57.520 --> 14:59.800
You had to execute, not decide.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.360
Or change the plans, fuck.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.360
And that murmuring thing,
what the heck is it?

15:04.960 --> 15:08.360
He heard the conversation and if he says
she wasn’t buying it, it means she wasn’t.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.360
We have been messing around
with the bloody inspector for some days.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.080
So it’s not his fault, okay? Are we clear?

15:14.320 --> 15:15.160
That’s right.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.360
She wasn’t going to phone the president,
or the TV, or her fucking mother.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.400
You and your things. You, assholes.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.000
"Despite his great performance,

15:35.080 --> 15:37.640
Río knew, the whole time,
he wanted to accept the deal,

15:38.960 --> 15:42.600
freeze time and get out of there
as if nothing had happened."

15:53.480 --> 15:55.880
Would you have liked
to accept the deal with the police?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.400
You know that all this won’t end well,
don’t you?

16:04.400 --> 16:06.840
Do you know what life imprisonment
without a possibility of parole is?

16:09.720 --> 16:10.680
That’s what I’ll get.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.000
I killed a security guy

16:17.320 --> 16:20.760
and some months later I broke into here,

16:22.400 --> 16:23.760
and I shot a police officer.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.320
And you look so demure.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.880
Do you think a judge will believe
in my reintegration?

16:32.320 --> 16:33.160
No.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.640
I trust the Professor.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.200
I fully support him.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.320
You didn’t answer me.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.400
Would you have liked to accept?

17:02.040 --> 17:02.880
Well, really...

17:04.080 --> 17:06.000
what would happen if we got out of here?

17:06.800 --> 17:08.120
Would we stay together?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.040
Would you be trying to give me
my badge back all the time?

17:14.720 --> 17:16.520
You're talking
about betraying your friends.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.680
My friends?
My friends who have names of cities?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.600
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Denver...

17:25.560 --> 17:28.360
My friends with cities' names
are ass-kicking.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.480
And I’m going to tell you something.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.000
You’d better hide away
if you accept the deal,

17:38.200 --> 17:40.840
because if I see you,
I’ll shoot you in your temple.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.280
I’ve just spoken to the security guard.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.440
I saw him in the toilet.
He says that they are penned up,

18:00.520 --> 18:04.080
11 security guards and 4 police officers.
They are our last chance.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.480
I’m not hungry, thank you.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.160
-Are you sure?
-Yes, thanks.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
Our last chance,
how, if they are penned up?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.080
We have to give them arms at all costs.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.000
And also, obtain tools
and pass them on to them.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.560
Which tools do you want to steal?

18:25.720 --> 18:28.960
Drill bits, hammers, screws, anything.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.360
You saw what I saw,
they’ve got and arsenal down there.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.920
We have to take them
and leave them in the toilet.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.160
Look, Pablo, I can’t do this on my own.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.920
All right? I need your help.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.040
When this Slavic gorilla
escorts me for a walk,

18:45.040 --> 18:47.240
-I need you to distract him.
-Me?

18:47.320 --> 18:50.080
Yes, he has treated my wound,
he doesn’t take his eyes off me,

18:50.160 --> 18:51.200
he helps me to walk.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.120
Then you distract him.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.120
And I’ll steal the tools
and whatever is needed.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
It’s over.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.040
Arturo, relax.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.880
Take care of your wound.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.400
I’ll come later.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.320
Come on, those in the tunnel, here.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.960
-Those at the printing press, there.
-Don’t talk about the plan to anyone.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.240
It’s only for us. The fewer we are,

19:14.320 --> 19:17.960
the more chances we have to succeed.
We’ll help the others from outside.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.440
Arturo, I’ll be back in a minute.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.600
Come in.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.720
And sit down.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.320
Mercedes.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.120
Hello.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.680
I called you in to see
what can be done about your pupil.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.160
She ran away and we found her
hiding inside the safety box.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.080
Why do you think she’s so rebellious?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.600
It might be, perhaps,
rebelliousness of virgins?

19:59.800 --> 20:03.240
-What are you talking about, virgins?
-Nairobi.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.720
We can see it in many species.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.200
Virgins are rebellious,
because they haven’t been broken in.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.840
I say this with all my respect.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.600
It’s like what happens to mares,
not until they are broken in,

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
not until you ride them,

20:16.520 --> 20:20.240
they can run off, kick someone,
they are completely unpredictable.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.440
You must have heard
of that concept, haven’t you, miss?

20:27.040 --> 20:29.960
How old were you when you lost
your virginity, Mercedes?

20:31.440 --> 20:32.280
Mercedes.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.920
There’s no problem, you can say it,
please, we’re here,

20:36.440 --> 20:37.800
among friends.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.840
Miss.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.400
Well, eh...

20:45.800 --> 20:48.520
I, you see, come from
a very small town in Soria.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.600
When I was 24.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.800
Good.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.080
And weren’t you aware, before that,
of that virginal rebelliousness?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.920
I don’t really know.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.640
-Think about it.
-Maybe.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.240
As a matter of fact, before losing it,

21:05.400 --> 21:08.560
I ran away from home and went
to the Medinaceli festival, three times.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.680
-I don’t know if that’s...
-That’s it.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.920
Exactly that.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.360
Here you are.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.240
Intense "Volluto" with sugar.

21:22.720 --> 21:23.560
Thank you.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.480
Medinaceli festival.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.560
And you, Alison?

21:35.160 --> 21:36.000
Are you a virgin?

21:37.440 --> 21:38.280
Yes.

21:39.040 --> 21:39.880
So what?

21:42.280 --> 21:44.400
I’m not scared of you
with those nutty speeches.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.760
You won’t do anything to me, you know why?

21:47.320 --> 21:50.720
Because I’m not just a hostage.
I’m a safe-conduct.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.800
This is it.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.840
The rebelliousness of the virgins,

21:57.000 --> 21:58.240
here it is, no doubt.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.320
Ariadna, darling, please, can you pass me
that small red folder?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.280
-Coming.
-Sure.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.120
Let’s see what we have here.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.200
Your aunt Becky,
volunteer in a small village in Mali.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.320
Here we have your cousin Elsie,

22:25.960 --> 22:27.920
looking very beautiful in Kings College.

22:28.760 --> 22:32.400
Brian, it’s the brainy one in the family,
in Wellington.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.640
And here we have several photos,

22:35.720 --> 22:38.680
whose? Your sister Lis, just next to you,

22:39.280 --> 22:41.880
in La Moraleja,
she goes to the same school as you.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.840
However, I think she doesn't have
your same temper.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.920
A girl from your social status
I’m sure has no idea

22:52.000 --> 22:54.480
how much a hit man costs to hire, do you?

22:55.840 --> 22:58.520
We can find a decent one
for 30,000 euros.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.920
However, to shoot your aunt in Africa

23:02.000 --> 23:04.200
10,000 euros can arrange it, 10,000 euros.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.600
Your family’s lives are in your hands.

23:12.040 --> 23:12.920
Nairobi.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.240
Move.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.120
Move.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.000
When I told you to make yourself heard,
I should have said

23:23.080 --> 23:25.080
what’s most important
is to choose the right moment.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.640
Call to monitor, Berlin.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.240
-Everything well here, and in there?
-"Everything in order."

23:45.160 --> 23:47.880
Brilliant, then the next phone call
in six hours.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.760
Inspector,

23:52.600 --> 23:55.800
the underground unit have found
oscillations on the seismograph.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.960
They are working with heavy machinery.
Indeed, they’re building a tunnel.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.840
We need to bring in a GPR, now.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.680
See if we can find out
where they are building the bloody tunnel.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.600
I’m on it.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.360
Let’s see, listen all up.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.000
Those who are not essential here
may leave.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.840
Essential means
those who are doing something now.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.760
The rest of you can go and have a rest.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.720
And have a shower, please.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.480
This is beginning to smell of deep police.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.160
I rectify.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.040
Please, can you all go out for a moment?

24:44.040 --> 24:46.160
I have to relieve you from the case,
I’m sorry.

24:47.840 --> 24:52.200
I think all this will be clarified,
but, right now, I can’t trust you.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.720
You cannot trust me.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.440
The thing is that you and I
knew about Toledo, Raquel.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.920
You and I.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.320
What the heck are you talking about?

25:05.720 --> 25:07.000
I am not the betrayer.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.840
So it’s only down to you.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.560
What a nerve!

25:12.520 --> 25:14.640
They knew we were entering the museum
wearing the masks

25:14.720 --> 25:16.360
at the same time you knew it,

25:16.560 --> 25:19.160
and they knew
we were going to the wreck yard,

25:19.320 --> 25:21.720
and they knew about the fucking pharmacy.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.400
Yes, it can’t be anything else, huh?

25:23.560 --> 25:25.640
-What thing?
-Who knows? A phone call,

25:25.720 --> 25:27.320
a telephone, a fucking microphone.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.560
-Only you and I knew about the pharmacy.
-And you didn’t tell anyone, have you? No?

25:31.640 --> 25:34.760
"Not even that weird guy from the café.
Did you say anything to him?

25:34.840 --> 25:36.760
-What?
-To him, your shoulder to cry on.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.800
A guy shows up here yesterday,
and you tell him about your whole life.

25:39.880 --> 25:40.960
As if you were new in this."

25:41.320 --> 25:42.720
And you don’t suspect him.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.560
He’s been inside here, Raquel,
he’s been inside the tent.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.000
Have you checked him out?

25:48.760 --> 25:51.480
Because I have.
Have you done your bloody job?

25:51.640 --> 25:54.880
He has a workshop, that fellow, nearby.
He says he makes cider.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.880
And everything is covered by thin canvas,
who knows what he’ll be covering.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.840
-Don’t tell me you have followed him.
-Yes, I’ve been following him.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.960
He doesn’t do any cider or any bullocks.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.880
He makes rubbish cider from a carton
and pours it into a cauldron.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.400
And there’s rubbish all over,
fucking hell.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.440
He has a car which is just scrap,
and sleeps in a bunk bed

26:11.520 --> 26:13.440
surrounded by wheels and oil stains.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.920
It smells like a chemist cooking meth
and I don’t know what the heck he cooks.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.120
He is dodgy, Raquel, he is.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.800
And you suspect me, I’m the only suspect.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.400
Me, me, me!

26:29.200 --> 26:31.960
How much will they pay you, one million?
Two?

26:40.640 --> 26:41.680
Look here, Raquel.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.520
Listen carefully.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.120
Bugger off.

26:53.560 --> 26:54.400
Suárez!

26:54.880 --> 26:56.440
-Suárez!
-I can’t believe it.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.880
Handcuff him and take him away.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.840
Calm down, inspector.
That’s not the protocol.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.320
-Yes, yes it is, Suárez, handcuff me.
-Bugger off the protocol.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.200
-Handcuff me.
-Handcuff him and take him away.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.280
If you want, I can call Internal Affairs,

27:10.360 --> 27:13.120
but, for the time being,
no one is going to handcuff no one.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.360
Raquel.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.480
I’ve been 15 years with you.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.280
With me? No.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.600
You’ve been getting close to me
to see if I fall for you.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.400
Always fucking Cercedilla in your mouth.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.440
Always "I’m leaving Mari Carmen."

27:28.160 --> 27:31.600
And your fucking womanizer’s jokes.
And now, that at last, I say no to you

27:31.680 --> 27:34.920
it happens that Mr Pervert Pimpin here
has turned into a betrayer,

27:35.080 --> 27:36.280
a betrayer.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.760
What did you sell, Ángel?

27:40.600 --> 27:41.680
Our friendship?

27:42.640 --> 27:43.800
This operation?

27:45.320 --> 27:46.160
Look here,

27:46.800 --> 27:48.440
leave right now.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.880
"Do you know
what ‘collateral damage’ means?

28:03.200 --> 28:06.560
It’s a term coined during the war
in Vietnam by the American army,

28:07.440 --> 28:10.720
when they didn’t have the guts
to talk clearly about killing civilians.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.480
But it’s sometimes used
to take the blame off you,

28:17.120 --> 28:18.200
like a boomerang.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.040
And that was what was
about to happen to the Professor."

28:34.440 --> 28:35.760
Hurry up.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.280
Faster, faster, hurry.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.800
Hurry, faster.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.960
Take a couple of bags

28:50.120 --> 28:51.520
and clean this crap.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.000
Dinner is next.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.520
I managed to steal a few things
from the tool box.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.440
What things?

28:59.680 --> 29:02.080
Some saw blades,

29:03.120 --> 29:04.800
some screwdrivers, files.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.000
Look.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.480
What are you doing? Hide it away.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.600
In 35 minutes,

29:15.280 --> 29:16.880
ask to be escorted to the toilet.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.280
Go in the second loo on the left.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.480
Take the tools and you duct tape them
under the lid of the loo, inside.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.680
They will get there in about 40 minutes,
All right?

29:28.840 --> 29:31.440
It can’t be. Me? Me again?

29:35.880 --> 29:39.480
I have stolen all the tools.
I’m loaded with scrap, fuck.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.160
And you want to hand it to me here?

29:45.480 --> 29:47.520
Do your part and I’ll do mine, mate.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.560
"Raquel?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.840
Is there anything the matter?
Are you all right?"

29:55.920 --> 29:59.640
Well, I’m here alone and bored
in the café and...

30:00.880 --> 30:03.600
and a little disappointed,
if I’m honest with you.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.320
Excuse me, I don’t quite understand,
disappointed?

30:07.880 --> 30:10.360
I was meeting up with someone for dinner.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.440
My first dinner out in eight years

30:13.600 --> 30:16.840
"with someone who wasn’t
my family, I mean.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.880
But I think he stood me up."

30:20.640 --> 30:24.960
And won’t it be
that you were 36 minutes early?

30:25.600 --> 30:29.040
"It’s possible. The truth is I’m
a very impatient woman."

30:30.880 --> 30:32.040
Sorry, Salva.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.640
Excuse the joke, no...

30:34.720 --> 30:37.400
I just wanted to make sure
you remembered about our date.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.200
"The truth is
being stood up horrifies me."

30:43.120 --> 30:47.520
I wouldn’t know what to do, how to get
out of here if you didn’t show up.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.040
I guess I’d stay here
in my high heel shoes and on my own and...

30:52.640 --> 30:55.840
drinking pints
until they told me to leave.

30:56.320 --> 31:00.280
-Relentless.
-"No, embarrassed to death."

31:01.480 --> 31:02.560
Don’t worry.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.280
I’ll soon be with you
with those pints, in five minutes.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
"See you very soon."

31:08.400 --> 31:09.480
See you very soon.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.120
"When you’re close to me,
I can’t even breathe."

31:32.960 --> 31:34.080
Breathe then.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.480
In nine months
you will not be able to breathe.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.680
"It’s a joke, isn’t it?"

31:41.120 --> 31:43.320
-Tell me it’s a joke.
-It’s not a joke.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.680
-No, it’s not a joke.
-No.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.040
Monica, I’m, technically,

31:48.720 --> 31:49.680
I’m sterile.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.960
"You must be Shiva,
the fertility goddess."

31:55.080 --> 31:58.360
Shall I phone my wife, and the kids,
and we all go to celebrate it.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.800
I told you that we had problems,
not that we were breaking up.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.120
I brought you a menu,
you’ll be blown away.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.440
Look, a sandwich that...

32:15.920 --> 32:19.680
Well, I have eaten it a couple of times
and I’m still alive, so more or less...

32:20.880 --> 32:24.760
Some biscuits, that...
I took the gluten free ones,

32:25.160 --> 32:27.000
because I thought you might

32:28.240 --> 32:30.600
-be gluten intolerant, as many people.
-Yes.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.720
Perhaps, these better.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.040
A chocolate pastry,
because I like them very much.

32:34.560 --> 32:35.840
Ah, well, and...

32:36.520 --> 32:37.760
Some sweets.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.160
Do you want some?

34:20.160 --> 34:22.720
"Hello, Raquel speaking.
I can’t answer your call right now.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.320
If it’s urgent,
leave your message after the beep."

34:26.120 --> 34:26.960
Raquel.

34:28.640 --> 34:29.840
Raquel, it’s Ángel.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Listen, I’m asking you to reconsider.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.520
Look, I can understand your rage.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.840
I also overdid it, but...

34:38.440 --> 34:41.440
Blimey, this is not the first row
we have had, you and I, is it?

34:45.240 --> 34:46.080
Look...

34:46.840 --> 34:49.960
I’m probably an asshole
or whatever you want, but...

34:51.320 --> 34:52.880
but I’m not the mole.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.720
I’m not the mole, for fuck’s sake.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.600
You’ll screw my life up, Raquel.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.120
You’ll screw my life up, damn it.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.480
Give me a call.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.080
What do you think about,
on the morning before a robbery?

35:35.280 --> 35:37.280
You get up and, what’s on your mind?

35:39.320 --> 35:40.320
I don’t know.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.800
You get up there, at dawn,

35:46.600 --> 35:47.440
"you smoke,

35:48.760 --> 35:50.360
talk about nonsense."

35:50.800 --> 35:53.120
What on earth are you doing
smoking so early?

35:53.200 --> 35:55.160
Here we go, said the pot to the kettle.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.600
-How are you?
-Fine.

36:01.040 --> 36:01.880
And you?

36:03.280 --> 36:04.520
Nothing extraordinary.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.200
A lot of courage is needed.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.280
I say it because I think
about that kind of things, you know?

36:12.320 --> 36:14.560
About people who are on death row

36:14.880 --> 36:17.680
or those guys that go in a rat hole,
shooting around.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.320
-It’s not that bad.
-Yes.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.040
It is. A very cowardly person
is telling you.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.120
Look at me,

36:26.160 --> 36:28.920
with a married man to avoid failure

36:29.400 --> 36:30.400
or being dumped.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.880
-You’re no coward.
-I am.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.240
-You’re not.
-Yes, I am.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.320
You stole a mobile
in the middle of a robbery.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.480
You insisted on me shooting you
in your leg.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.560
You stood firm before Berlin
who is crackers.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.880
And you had the guts
to grab me by the neck and kiss me

36:46.600 --> 36:47.520
and fuck me.

36:48.440 --> 36:52.080
You need to have a lot of guts to bang
a loser wearing a Dali face mask.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.280
You are Nikita, the secretary version.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.200
Actually, the morning of the heist

37:04.240 --> 37:05.680
I was scared to death.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.400
"A fucking crazy thing."

37:07.560 --> 37:10.000
-What?
-All this stuff, dad.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.360
This guy...

37:14.600 --> 37:16.480
He may look very clever, but...

37:17.400 --> 37:19.840
-I don’t know, it’s crazy shit.
-No, it isn’t, no.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.400
At least he knows what he’s talking about.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.360
I started to doubt everything.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.680
-I don’t know what I’m doing here.
-You’re with me.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.160
But the thing is that everyone
is an expert in something.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.480
So, the woman that fakes the banknotes.
You that...

37:37.360 --> 37:41.400
You are a wizard at what you do, but I...
I haven’t done anything good in my life.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.440
But he's a really good guy.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.120
He told me he needed me and here I am,

37:46.640 --> 37:50.360
meeting the most beautiful girl
in all this crazy stuff.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.480
One minute.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.720
"These are the tools we managed to steal.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.720
Get undressed and tape them to your body
with insulating tape

38:33.840 --> 38:35.960
to take them to the basement,
and untie yourselves.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.960
Cut the ducts in the boilers room
and anything you can use as a weapon.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.080
At 9 PM they’ll take your dinner down.
Take that chance

38:43.160 --> 38:47.080
to disarm your captors and escape.
We’ll meet up at the warehouse,

38:47.160 --> 38:48.800
hidden behind the coils.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.440
I’ll try to take as many hostages
as possible without compromising the plan.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.560
One second.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.520
Out.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.520
Thank goodness that I showed up.

39:05.880 --> 39:09.640
As your date has stood you up...

39:10.600 --> 39:11.440
Yes, yes.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.080
I don’t know what would've happened to me
if you hadn’t showed up.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.280
And your date,

39:18.520 --> 39:20.240
were you particularly
interested in it or...?

39:21.720 --> 39:23.440
No, not anymore.

39:24.920 --> 39:25.840
What a shame.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.840
What a shame.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.240
Fine then, let’s see if I’m any good.

39:33.800 --> 39:34.960
I’m sure you are.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.200
Good, that makes me happy.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.680
But I have something to confess

39:42.200 --> 39:45.840
that we both are in danger, because...

39:46.800 --> 39:50.440
if I have another one of these,
I may start to hum "muñeiras".

39:51.560 --> 39:53.480
And we’ll have a problem.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.880
I’m sure you look very funny.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.680
When will we start addressing each other
less formally?

40:07.800 --> 40:11.280
When you look at me under the table.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.520
Come on, Salva.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.240
Have a peep.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.640
Look at me under the table.

40:33.440 --> 40:37.280
I warn you that if you’re going to do
like in "Basic Instinct",

40:37.720 --> 40:40.760
I might need something stronger,
because I’m a little conservative.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.320
Salva, listen to me.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.680
I don’t want you to make a scene here.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.840
I’m quite sure
that you’re hiding something

41:13.920 --> 41:16.200
in that workshop
where you supposedly make cider.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.360
So either:

41:20.120 --> 41:21.680
you willingly take me there

41:22.760 --> 41:25.320
or we wait here
until I get a search warrant,

41:25.400 --> 41:28.680
but I’m warning you
it could take a couple of hours.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.720
So...

41:32.680 --> 41:33.680
you choose.
