00:06.006 --> 00:07.717
â™ª â™ª

00:36.162 --> 00:37.788
â™ª â™ª

00:51.844 --> 00:55.931
I've been going out
a lot lately,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.726
with the intention of...

00:58.768 --> 01:01.437
finding someone.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.355
And at least it
hasn't just been sex,

01:03.397 --> 01:08.944
but this idea that I'll find,
uh, my person.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.238
â™ª â™ª

01:11.280 --> 01:16.243
'Cause lately it just...
alone.

01:16.285 --> 01:21.123
The world just feels so...
awful.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.750
Dank.

01:22.792 --> 01:26.545
You know, this dread.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.423
And I feel like
I'm on the outside of the world.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.221
(sighs) Then...

01:37.890 --> 01:39.892
you meet someone.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.356
You could see everything
so much clearer.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.234
And it's...

01:48.275 --> 01:50.069
it's everything.

01:52.822 --> 01:56.116
Suddenly, you're on
the inside of the world again.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.160
GROUP:
God,

01:58.202 --> 02:00.788
grant me the serenity

02:00.830 --> 02:04.083
to accept the things
I cannot change,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.961
the courage to change
the things I can,

02:07.002 --> 02:10.297
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.550
How much longer
is this gonna go on for?

02:12.591 --> 02:14.260
HERBERT:
We're almost done.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.970
Did Professor Mackinaw
ever promise you anything

02:16.011 --> 02:17.304
in exchange for sex?

02:17.346 --> 02:19.014
No, of course not.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.267
Money or more teaching sections?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.768
No.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.687
-Leslie isn't like that.
-HERBERT: Do you dispute

02:24.728 --> 02:27.356
you had a sexual relationship
with Professor Mackinaw?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.024
My personal life is
none of your business.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.235
I'm a graduate student,
not a child.

02:31.277 --> 02:33.112
Well, we have to investigate
every complaint.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.199
Nothing was done to me here.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.450
Do you understand?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.870
We were friends, colleagues,

02:40.911 --> 02:42.955
lovers.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.165
I never even lodged a complaint.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.459
Four other female students did.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.128
One of them was an undergrad.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.673
MAURA:
This just in.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.967
(students laugh)

02:55.009 --> 02:56.927
I am going to Israel.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.138
-(students gasp and cheer)
-Yes.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.806
Uh, the Holy Land.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.100
Uh, they asked me
to present a paper

03:03.142 --> 03:06.228
at the Judaism
and Gender Conference

03:06.270 --> 03:07.479
at Bar-Afik University,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.607
and I will be gone
for two weeks.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.900
(students groan)

03:10.941 --> 03:12.651
No, yep, well, uh,
in my absence,

03:12.693 --> 03:16.614
I would be very delighted
were you to

03:16.655 --> 03:17.865
livestream the event.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.491
How many are going
to livestream?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.036
Oh, thank you.
It's absolutely required.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.704
-Um...
-(students laugh)

03:23.746 --> 03:26.749
So, let's just hope that
I am better received there

03:26.790 --> 03:29.001
than the last Jew
who went a-preachin'.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.086
-(students laugh)
-Professor Pfefferman

03:31.128 --> 03:32.421
out!

03:32.463 --> 03:35.257
(students laugh, cheer)

03:35.299 --> 03:37.301
(both grunting, moaning)

03:40.179 --> 03:42.181
Oh, yeah.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.475
-Oh, fuck.
-What? What?

03:44.516 --> 03:46.268
I forgot to
sign this permission slip

03:46.310 --> 03:47.937
for Ella's field trip.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.731
-What field trip? -She's going
to some fucking farm.

03:50.773 --> 03:53.567
-Today? -Yeah, it's like
a petting zoo or some shit.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.319
What, like Knott's Berry
or something?

03:55.361 --> 03:57.363
-Yeah, they got, like,
baby animals. -(moans)

03:57.404 --> 03:59.990
They got, like, sheep
and fucking pigs,

04:00.032 --> 04:02.743
and goats, and little lambs
and all that shit.

04:02.785 --> 04:04.703
-(moans)
-Oh, fuck.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.996
-(moans)
-I'll sign it later.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.247
(moans loudly)

04:07.289 --> 04:10.709
(quacking)

04:10.751 --> 04:12.586
ROSALIE:
Shelly Pfefferman!

04:12.628 --> 04:14.088
Do you smell this exhaust?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.548
Rosalie Rollman.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.176
This moving truck of yours
has been idling here

04:19.218 --> 04:21.261
-for over an hour.
-What's your problem, Rosalie?

04:21.303 --> 04:23.097
-It's just... i-it's...
-Your diaper too tight?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.933
-It is against he condo rules.
-SHELLY: The condo rules,

04:25.975 --> 04:27.184
-the condo rules.
-Yes, it is.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.936
This place is like
a dictatorship.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.313
-It's worse than America.
-Ah!

04:31.355 --> 04:34.024
-I'm glad you're going!
-You know what?

04:34.066 --> 04:38.195
I, I have a beautiful,
wonderful son

04:38.237 --> 04:40.406
who has invited me
to live with him.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.700
-Come on.
-You have no one.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.368
-Ah!
-Because you're a shtick drek!

04:44.410 --> 04:45.703
Ah!

04:45.744 --> 04:47.538
-I'm starting a new life
in Silver Lake -Out! Out!

04:47.579 --> 04:51.166
where they appreciate artists
such as myself.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.710
-ROSALIE: Ah, shut up!
-Isn't that right, Joshy?

04:52.751 --> 04:54.628
Get the truck out of here!

04:54.670 --> 04:56.380
SHELLY:
Fuck you, Rosalie,

04:56.422 --> 04:58.632
and this condo of corpses!

05:01.802 --> 05:03.220
SHELLY:
Tushy?

05:04.430 --> 05:06.765
Joshy!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.017
Tush?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.268
Tush-nush?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.688
Hungry!

05:12.730 --> 05:14.481
-J-Joshy?
-(door opens)

05:14.523 --> 05:16.275
Oh, there you are.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.985
Did you hear me calling you?

05:18.027 --> 05:19.361
Yeah, I heard you.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.779
All the neighbors heard you.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.157
Oh, stop it.
W-Why didn't you answer me?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.951
Because, Mom, I'm trying to
keep it chill in here, okay?

05:25.993 --> 05:28.454
Ooh, are you tired, puppy?

05:28.495 --> 05:30.956
No, I'm fine, I just, like,
your energy is, is like,

05:30.998 --> 05:32.458
-is literally like
-(kisses)

05:32.499 --> 05:34.334
there's a gas fire
in the kitchen right now.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.462
-Is there an emergency? -Yeah,
there's a fire in my belly;

05:36.503 --> 05:37.713
I'm hungry.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.757
Do you want to go to Gelson's
with me for the hot bar?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.925
They have that-that
wonderful cafe,

05:41.967 --> 05:44.136
that outdoor cafe
that's indoors.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.972
Um, it's super early.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.348
It's 5:00.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.683
Yeah, that's early.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.185
I don't do dinner till 8:00,

05:51.226 --> 05:53.604
but, you know, you can go.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.689
All right.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.483
Okay.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.490
â™ª Ah, ah, ah, ah â™ª

06:04.531 --> 06:06.366
â™ª Ah, ooh, ah, ooh â™ª

06:06.408 --> 06:08.035
â™ª Ah, ooh, ah â™ª

06:08.077 --> 06:09.995
â™ª Ah, ah â™ª

06:10.037 --> 06:11.163
â™ª Ah. â™ª

06:11.205 --> 06:12.956
(children shouting in German)

06:12.998 --> 06:15.417
(children shrieking, laughing)

06:15.459 --> 06:17.461
(shouting continues)

06:22.382 --> 06:23.759
(children laughing)

06:23.801 --> 06:24.843
GIRL:
I got you.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.554
BOY:
Tag.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.642
BOY:
Tag!

06:31.683 --> 06:33.685
Tag.
(squeals)

06:36.647 --> 06:38.565
GIRL:
(screams) Papa!

06:38.607 --> 06:39.441
-Papa!
-Papa!

06:39.483 --> 06:40.901
-Hi.
-(girl shouts in German)

06:40.943 --> 06:42.861
-Hi.
-(boy shouts in German)

06:42.903 --> 06:45.072
-BOY: Papa! (speaks German)
-What?

06:45.114 --> 06:46.198
No, there isn't.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.908
Hi. How are you?

06:47.950 --> 06:50.410
Exactly who are you
and-and how did you...

06:50.452 --> 06:52.037
Oh, I'm Ali.
I live down here.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.748
Um, hold that thought.
Go inside.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.502
(whistles)
Get in the house, now.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.796
Bye.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.172
AUGUST:
Mine, mine, mine, mine

07:02.214 --> 07:05.676
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.219
-ALI: Hi.
-Okay, hi.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.470
Let's-let's go ahead
and backtrack.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.888
-Okay?
-Hi.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.640
Who are you and how did you
get in the yard?

07:11.682 --> 07:13.976
I, uh, live in the apartment
right here,

07:14.017 --> 07:15.727
-so I just came out the...
-You're...

07:15.769 --> 07:17.521
-you're living here right now?
-Yeah.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.356
But I mean, on Airbnb,
you never said

07:19.398 --> 07:20.732
I'd be sharing the property.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.693
-Do you understand?
-Oh, well, it's...

07:22.734 --> 07:24.111
I mean, you can come
and take a look.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.904
It's totally a separate thing.
There's...

07:25.946 --> 07:27.114
-Let's-let's go eyeball it.
Sure. -You know,

07:27.156 --> 07:28.824
I have blinds down and...

07:28.866 --> 07:33.120
it's, like, nothing is attached
or open.

07:33.162 --> 07:35.706
-I mean, there's a door, but
it's closed, so... -All right.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.375
My concern is
my family's privacy dynamic

07:38.417 --> 07:41.044
because I have to be able to
walk anywhere I want to walk

07:41.086 --> 07:45.757
and be how I want to be
without my security breached.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.051
I hear you.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.887
I know you can hear me
and that worries me

07:49.928 --> 07:51.471
because you're down here,
all right?

07:51.513 --> 07:54.016
You're seeing things that
I don't want you to see.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.267
Not that there's anything
that... is there?

07:55.309 --> 07:56.977
There's nothing that--
if she wants to see things,

07:57.019 --> 07:58.687
she can see things, but it
doesn't make any difference.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.481
All right?
I want to be able to walk

08:01.523 --> 08:05.444
confidently...
in whatever state of mind

08:05.485 --> 08:08.197
and whatever state of undress,
knowing

08:08.238 --> 08:10.449
that I'm not gonna be looked at.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.534
Anyway, for the comfort
of my family,

08:12.576 --> 08:14.077
just stay out of the yard.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.662
Got it. Thank you.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.663
(whistles)
That'd be great.

08:16.705 --> 08:17.664
ALI:
Okay.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.249
I got it.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.502
-(snaps fingers)
-Let's go now, all right?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.463
(car horn blaring)

08:24.504 --> 08:27.007
LEN:
Are you guys getting hungry?

08:27.049 --> 08:28.759
-SARAH: Good morning.
-Good morning. Hi.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.260
LEN: You guys want some
black-and-white cookies?

08:30.302 --> 08:31.595
-Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
-ZACKY: Yeah.

08:31.637 --> 08:32.763
Can I get a dozen
black-and-whites?

08:32.804 --> 08:34.056
-ZACKY: And potato pancakes.
-You know what?

08:34.097 --> 08:35.224
ELLA:
Look, there's a gumball machine.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.100
Actually, that's kind of
for Hanukkah,

08:37.142 --> 08:38.310
but all right, yeah.
You know what, fine.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.686
-We'll have some potato
pancakes. -ZACKY: Dad, Dad, Dad.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.313
-Do you have any quarters? -And
can I get both kinds of lox?

08:41.355 --> 08:43.190
-No, I don't have any quarters.
-Oh, I found a quarter.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.566
I don't have quarters.

08:44.608 --> 08:45.651
-This is so fun.
-Oh, we should get some...

08:45.692 --> 08:47.027
Load them up, dude.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.445
Ooh, can I get a whole fish?

08:48.487 --> 08:49.780
Guys, look at this fish, guys.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.864
-CLERK: Sure.
-Come over here, guys.

08:50.906 --> 08:51.865
Look at this fish.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.784
That'll be fun. Uh...

08:53.825 --> 08:55.619
-ZACKY: Wait, it's still got
its eye. -LEN: That's a big one.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.579
-Yes, oh, my God, look. Perfect.
-It's got its whole head.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.373
ZACKY: It's got its eye,
it looks like a black pearl.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.375
-This is like...
-Do these people remember us?

09:01.416 --> 09:02.584
We used to have
our own standing order.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.961
I wonder if they're
gonna remember us.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.254
We used to have
a standing order here

09:05.295 --> 09:07.464
for, like, uh, years.
The Pfeffermans.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.049
Do you know the name?

09:09.091 --> 09:13.512
I don't remember.
You can pay at the register.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.306
Okay. Well, we did.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.143
ALI: And the children,
I swear to God,

09:20.185 --> 09:21.937
it's like they've got
Stockholm syndrome with him

09:21.979 --> 09:23.939
and he says that he's their dad,
but they're German; he's not.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.524
-How many are we?
-I mean,

09:25.565 --> 09:26.650
you thought they were
just gonna, like,

09:26.692 --> 09:27.776
-lie down like corpses?
-Yeah.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.236
If you're renting
somebody else's house,

09:29.278 --> 09:31.405
-it's not your house
all of a sudden. -I'm sorry.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.614
No, but you don't understand
what I'm saying.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.449
-How many are we? -It's too hard
for you to be there.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.993
-Why are you even here?
-Hey, how many are we?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.494
-It's one, two, three.
-(knock on door)

09:37.536 --> 09:40.706
-Hello, hello. -And then we got
Sarah, Zacky, Ella. -Hi!

09:40.747 --> 09:44.126
-(overlapping greetings)
-We have Maura, Bryna, Simon...

09:44.167 --> 09:46.044
-LEN: We caught a fish. -Wow,
you guys caught got a fish?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.588
How many of us are there that
you're gonna have so much food?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.090
Look at this, look at this,
look at this beast.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.550
-Wait a minute.
-Hold up, hold up.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.302
-We killed him.
-Oh, my God, that's enormous.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.053
JOSH: Guys, get that fishy smell
off the counter.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.930
SHELLY: Sweetheart, that--
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.057
-Sweetheart, this is too big.
-Open the fish up.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.560
How much... oy-ya-yoy, how much
did you pay for all of this?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.228
-It was a thousand dollars.
-Oh, stop it.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.522
-No, it had to be at least
a hundred. -It was actually

10:05.564 --> 10:08.567
-a thousand real dollars.
-Hello. -Put 'em over there.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.735
MAURA:
Sorry we're late.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.194
-SHELLY: I was very close. $104.
-ALI: What's that?

10:11.236 --> 10:13.488
SIMON: It's just the rest
of Grandma Rose's things.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.491
And I think Mom wanted you
to look through it.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.576
ALI:
Look at, I remember this.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.369
MAURA: Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Sorry I'm late.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.996
SARAH: Aunt Bryna,
you came with Moppa?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.164
That's so great.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.790
-Did you take the 5 or the 101?
-Yes, hello.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.043
-So nice to see you.
-Nice to see you, too.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.879
ALI:
This was Grandma Rose's?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.548
BRYNA: I didn't want
to give all this stuff away

10:31.590 --> 10:33.967
-after Grandma passed.
-This is so great.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.011
BRYNA: Thought I'd give
you chickees a look-see.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.305
-Oh, look at this. This is...
-This is good for you.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.556
I remember that.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.308
-It's pretty.
-ALI: This is kind of...

10:41.350 --> 10:42.517
-Look at this.
-Look at this.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.144
MAURA: Oh, that's actually,
that's... No, no, no.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.021
I mean, I don't think
that's gonna fit you, but...

10:46.063 --> 10:47.981
No, I said.
I already told him.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.608
SHELLY:
Look, this is gonna have moths.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.945
-Oh, my God! This! This!
-(Sarah laughs)

10:53.987 --> 10:55.906
-JOSH: All right.
-Oh, I loved this.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.991
-Now, that's dope.
-She made that.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.409
JOSH:
That is dope right there.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.911
-ALI: Do you remember this?
-SARAH: Totally.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.746
-Oh, my God. -ALI:
She crocheted this herself.

11:02.788 --> 11:03.955
SHELLY: You know how many moths
live in there?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.207
JOSH:
Is there any chance of bedbugs?

11:05.248 --> 11:06.625
-BRYNA: She always loved you,
Ali. -(Ella screams)

11:06.666 --> 11:08.919
SHELLY:
Ella, stop screaming.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.087
LEN:
It's just magic.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.172
SHELLY: So anyway,
you're going to Israel.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.799
How many hours is that flight?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.175
-14, 15 hours?
-I have no idea.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.510
LEN: I think it's so cool
you're teaching again, Maura.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.679
Oh, they're great.
I love it. I love, you know.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.931
SARAH: What, exactly, are you
gonna be doing over there?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.016
-MAURA: In Israel?
-SARAH: Yeah.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.559
MAURA:
Um, they call it...

11:24.601 --> 11:26.561
-ALI: Keynoting.
-MAURA: Keynoting.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.021
And they use it as a verb.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.856
And "Judaism, Cold War,
and Gender"

11:29.898 --> 11:31.983
-is the name of my lecture.
-Wow.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.860
-Triple threat.
-SARAH: Seriously?

11:33.902 --> 11:35.070
-Seriously.
-That is so cool. -(cork pops)

11:35.112 --> 11:36.321
-It is cool.
-SARAH: You guys,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.198
-I think we should raise
a glass. -That's really cool.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.367
-Let's raise something.
-LEN: Mazels to...

11:40.409 --> 11:41.868
your return to academia.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.538
-Next year in, uh...
-And to the motherland.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.915
I would like to go
to Israel before I die.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.625
I planted a tree there.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.127
Darling, we all
planted trees there.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.628
-No, no.
-I think it's a scam.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.171
-No, it's not a scam.
-LEN: That is a scam.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.173
It would be, like,
a forest by now.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.051
Sarah went, right?
You went junior year?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.928
Yeah. My first hand job.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.972
SHELLY:
Oh, my God!

12:02.013 --> 12:04.057
(screaming)

12:04.099 --> 12:05.434
(overlapping conversations)

12:05.475 --> 12:07.477
-JOSH: Let's move into dessert,
guys. SHELLY: Oy-ya-yoy,

12:07.519 --> 12:08.770
my squidgy, pudgy boy
wants dessert.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.313
-(golf ball struck on TV)
-Oh!

12:10.355 --> 12:12.149
-Everybody still eating?
-SHELLY: So, anyway, wait.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.817
So what time is this golf
gonna be over?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.527
SARAH:
Len, really? Do we have to?

12:15.569 --> 12:16.903
LEN:
Yes, it's Sunday, be quiet.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.697
-I can't hear them whispering.
-SARAH: Why, why, why?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.740
LEN: Everyone's talking and
I can't hear them whispering.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.076
It doesn't end.
That's the beauty of golf.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.203
SHELLY:
This is so goyishe.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.372
Grown men and their balls.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.332
(laughter)

12:29.374 --> 12:30.625
MAURA:
Are you okay?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.335
-Yeah.
-All right?

12:32.377 --> 12:34.045
-Yeah, I'm good. I'm just cozy.
-Oh, boy.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.131
Grandma Rose's blanket.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.967
-(Ella screams) -Guys...
can I throw this fish away?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.719
-(Ella screams) -Please?
-SHELLY: Ella, stop screaming.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.721
-LEN: No, no, no, no, no.
-JOSH: This is a dead carcass.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.681
LEN: Don't throw it away,
I'm not done with it.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.725
SHELLY: Can we just talk about
Israel for a minute?

12:46.766 --> 12:47.893
LEN:
Oh, here we go.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.811
SHELLY:
Simon, what did you do?

12:49.853 --> 12:51.229
They need to
get over it already.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.939
They should just call it
Israelstine or Pisrael.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.733
SHELLY:
I will tell you

12:54.774 --> 12:58.195
what the problem
with the two-state solution is.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.822
It sounds too much like
the Final Solution.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.866
-Oh, he cut off his finger
again. -(Ella screams)

13:02.908 --> 13:05.243
ALI:
Nothing was done to me.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.703
I never lodged a complaint.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.581
-Four other female
students did. -...done to me.

13:09.623 --> 13:10.999
One of them was an undergrad.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.043
ALI: We were friends.
...done to me.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.920
-BRYNA: Hello.
-(door closes)

13:14.961 --> 13:18.340
SHELLY: Josh, kids, your Aunt
Bryna and Uncle Jerry are here.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.926
JERRY:
What is going on in here?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.386
-Uncle Jerry!
-Yes, yes, yes, yes.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.889
You're like a model, Sarah.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.141
-Thank you, thank you.
-Oh. (laughs)

13:28.183 --> 13:30.852
JERRY:
Wait, is that Ali over there?

13:30.894 --> 13:33.438
-How old are you now? -Ali,
come on up here and say hello.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.398
-Okay. -You're all grown up.
-Ali, come in the kitchen.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.108
You look great,
you look healthy.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.027
-Why are you being so shy?
-I'm... -Come on up here.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.071
What, are you not proud
of yourself, Ali?

13:41.112 --> 13:42.489
-Um, I don't know.
-Ali, what is the holdup?

13:42.531 --> 13:44.824
-Come on, give me a hug.
-SHELLY: Ali, don't be rude.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.953
-Don't be a brat.
-Go ahead, Ali, hug him already.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.412
It's just a hug.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.456
It's not like he wants
to smush up against you

13:51.498 --> 13:53.124
-to feel your tits.
-Of course not.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.585
-Just go ahead and do it.
-Give him a hug!

13:55.627 --> 13:57.712
-I hug my uncle all the time.
-I mean, it's a simple embrace.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.464
-There you go. -Uh-huh, uh-huh.
-JERRY: You're blossoming.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.133
-SHELLY: That's my girl.
-Yes.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.593
See, it's no big deal.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.720
She's becoming a woman.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.138
BRYNA:
Isn't this fun?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.182
SARAH: I honestly think
we should do this every week.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.433
LEN:
Every week is a lot.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.519
SARAH: No, we could have
the standing order at Canter's.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.396
SHELLY: Oh, I think
that's a very good idea.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.566
I'm just saying. You don't have
to come every week, but, like...

14:17.607 --> 14:20.277
-the space is here. -MAURA:
Does anybody have any Aleve?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.529
I have Tylenol with codeine.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.531
MAURA: No, no codeine.
That constipates.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.658
SHELLY: You know,
you're absolutely right.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.909
MAURA:
Codeine does constipate.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.077
SHELLY: Codeine absolutely
constipates you.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.495
-Absolutely constipates.
-No, it truly does. -Yeah.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.457
JOSH:
Oh, yeah.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.501
ALI: Oh, I will not spend
another second of my life

14:36.543 --> 14:38.587
listening to Aunt Bryna
slurp coffee.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.047
-(laughter)
-(Sarah imitates slurping)

14:41.089 --> 14:44.050
What about Mom with
the fish bone as the toothpick?

14:44.092 --> 14:46.136
Why do you want to
do this every week?

14:46.177 --> 14:49.139
-Disgusting. -What? No, family
is gross, but it's important.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.308
God, Aunt Bryna!

14:51.349 --> 14:54.603
You guys, she is transformed
since Rose died.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.063
-She's so happy.
-Yeah.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.482
Well, we'd be transformed
if our parents died.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.943
-Really?
-Guys, you realize

15:01.985 --> 15:03.361
Mom can't say a sentence
without numbers in it?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.654
She's obsessed.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.615
I mean, all Jews are obsessed
with numbers.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.116
I just never realized, like,
how constant it is,

15:08.158 --> 15:11.077
you know what I'm saying?
Does she have OCD?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.204
Maybe you should ask her tonight
when you two are spooning.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.165
-(laughter)
-JOSH: That's pretty good.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.791
Don't laugh too hard,
you guys are next.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.376
-No. Not it.
-Not it.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.587
-Said it first.
-JOSH: You guys are despicable.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.172
I was worried about her

15:22.213 --> 15:24.049
-after Buzzy left.
-Mmm.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.217
By the way, I saw you
playing footsies with Len.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.303
-Oh, shut up.
-You back on the Len bone?

15:28.345 --> 15:32.265
-Actually, yes. Sometimes.
-I'm not judging.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.225
It's cute.
It's, like, it's easy.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.935
Yeah, it's nice to have
a standing order.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.395
-Exactly.
-ALI: That's depressing.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.439
-JOSH: Oh, my God.
-No, it's not.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.982
It's, like,
nice to have comfort.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.984
I don't want, like,
my whole life to be driven

15:43.026 --> 15:45.779
by my vaginal impulses;
I don't want to be that person.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.281
-Um, you are that person.
-Look who's talking.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.949
-Look who's talking.
-Me?

15:49.991 --> 15:51.660
-Not me. -No, no, no.
-You guys are worse than I am.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.537
-No way, you're number one.
-No, I'm not.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.915
Close second. Close second
with the vaginal impulses.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.833
-Oh, my God, wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait. -JOSH: What?

15:58.875 --> 16:00.168
Here, hold this.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.879
There was actually
a sex addicts quiz on BuzzFeed

16:02.921 --> 16:05.006
-and I thought of you both.
-Mm.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.925
-All right, let's hear it.
-"Are you a sex addict?"

16:06.966 --> 16:08.301
-Mm-hmm. -You ready?
-Bring it.

16:08.343 --> 16:12.889
Number one, "Do you get high
from sex or romance?"

16:12.931 --> 16:14.557
-Check.
-Bigly.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.226
Check, check.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.727
-Check.
-Check.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.187
-Okay, fine, yes,
but who doesn't? -Normal.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.606
-Number two...
-Thank you.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.651
Uh, "Have you lost count
of your sexual partners?"

16:38.039 --> 16:39.374
Fuck, who was that?

16:39.416 --> 16:40.959
-ALI: This is hard.
-Next question.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.377
-Next question. -SARAH:
Oh, wait, wait, I'm still...

16:42.419 --> 16:43.586
Let's consider that a yes.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.547
-Definitely don't remember
names. -JOSH: Moving on.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.382
Three, have your desires
driven you to have sex

16:47.424 --> 16:49.676
in places or with people that
you would normally not choose?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.136
-(laughs)
-Fuck, yeah.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.430
-Ew.
-Disgusting people-- okay,

16:53.471 --> 16:55.181
-stop with the creepy laugh.
-JOSH: Yeah!

16:55.223 --> 16:56.599
ALI: Okay, what's next,
what's next?

16:56.641 --> 16:58.268
-I'm grossing myself out.
I am-- ugh! -That's a yes.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.728
That's a yes,
that's three for three.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.229
-Four. Four.
-(Josh whoops)

17:01.271 --> 17:04.232
Do you believe
that your happiness depends

17:04.274 --> 17:06.234
on having a great sex life?

17:06.276 --> 17:08.862
-Yes. -JOSH: Obvs.
-You realize this is a test

17:08.903 --> 17:10.655
to determine
if you're a sex addict.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.615
All that stuff is normal.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.700
Yeah, this is...
everybody has this.

17:13.742 --> 17:14.951
We were just "yes"
on all-- okay.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.244
You know what? Whatever.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.871
I dare us all to go
to a meeting together,

17:17.912 --> 17:19.122
and then you'll see
what's normal.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.000
-Fine. -Is it possible
we're all sex addicts?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.752
JOSH (laughs):
I guess we're gonna find out.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.338
-Hmm. -SARAH:
We forgot to get high, you guys.

17:33.470 --> 17:37.390
(line ringing)

17:37.432 --> 17:38.933
(door buzzes)

17:46.941 --> 17:52.447
â™ª Like a light inside â™ª

17:55.158 --> 17:58.787
â™ª Like a holy wine â™ª

18:02.749 --> 18:06.628
â™ª Love climb to heavens above â™ª

18:06.669 --> 18:10.048
(moaning)

18:10.089 --> 18:13.218
â™ª Oh, right now, baby â™ª

18:13.259 --> 18:18.515
â™ª Give me all of your love. â™ª

18:18.556 --> 18:20.225
JOSH: Jesus, I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.894
ALI: I know. Oh, my God,
you guys, we need fake names.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.355
-SARAH: I'm Donna de Varona.
-JOSH: I can be Marge.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.523
(laughter)

18:26.564 --> 18:30.360
-It's like... Oh, my God.
-Wow.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.323
-Oh, my God. -ALI: Wow.
What a fucking cool building.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.453
It's amazing.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.664
(whispering):
Holy fuck.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.083
See that chick in the red?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.627
I think she taught
at Ella's nursery school.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.379
-So?
-Well...

18:49.420 --> 18:52.757
Dirty, dirty. Not approved
to work with children.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.259
(laughs quietly)

18:54.300 --> 18:57.595
Hey, calm it down a little bit.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.807
SARAH:
I'm gonna go say hi to her.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.852
Um, hi. I... do you...
I, are you...?

19:03.893 --> 19:05.895
I'm sorry, you worked
at, uh, East Side JCC?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.772
Yeah. You're, you're Ella's mom.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.898
-(laughs): Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.316
Otherwise known as Sarah.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.901
-(chuckles) Lila.
-Sorry. Li--

19:11.943 --> 19:13.695
-Lila, of course, I knew that.
-Yep. Right.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.613
-Just Lila. -BRE: Okay, guys.
Let's get started.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.323
-It's nice to see you.
-Yeah.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.533
BRE:
Hi, everyone.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.118
Welcome.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.036
GARRETT:
Hi, I'm Garrett.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.956
I'm recently widowed,
and I'm living

19:24.998 --> 19:27.083
in a senior complex right now.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.502
WOMAN: Ugh, when I was young,
I was really obsessed

19:29.544 --> 19:31.671
with, uh, Pippi Longstocking.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.966
I realize I really wanted
to have sex with her.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.176
Hi, I'm Michael,
and I'm a sex and love addict.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.137
Women are coming up to me
all the time.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.471
So, pigtails, red hair.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.974
People who own horses
are my triggers.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.560
GARRETT: And I don't feel that
I should act on these impulses.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.354
These triggers, uh,
just set me off

19:48.396 --> 19:49.856
-on seduction trips...
-(overlapping sharing)

19:49.898 --> 19:51.316
...and I follow people.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.526
MICHAEL: I want to talk
to you guys about it.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.820
-WOMAN: I-I can't stop.
-MICHAEL: I just need help.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.614
I'm very ashamed.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.199
MICHAEL: So this thing
has been bugging me,

20:00.241 --> 20:03.745
like crazy, and I, maybe you
guys can help me out with this.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.664
I'm thinking about my past and
about the people I've been with.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.792
And all the sex
I had when I was young.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.129
And it was mainly because people
wanted to have sex with me.

20:13.171 --> 20:16.049
I wasn't even...
really wanting it.

20:16.090 --> 20:21.012
But I felt... like,
obliged to do so.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.514
And it, it wasn't that
I didn't know how to say no,

20:23.556 --> 20:27.352
I just, I felt like,
like if my...

20:27.393 --> 20:28.770
if my body is responding,

20:28.811 --> 20:31.731
then...

20:31.773 --> 20:33.858
it means yes.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.778
Meaning, the thing
that just occurred to me,

20:36.819 --> 20:38.947
which is gonna sound weird,

20:38.988 --> 20:43.743
but it feels like a revelation.

20:43.785 --> 20:48.498
That maybe an erection
is not consent.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.458
JOSH: That's brilliant,
what you just said right there.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.961
-BRE: Um, no cross-talk. -You
said an erection is not consent.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.796
That's, that's cross-talk.
We don't do that here.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.547
-JOSH: I'm sorry, my bad.
-Totally cool.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.591
-Sorry. Yeah, okay.
-It's cool.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.385
-My bad.
-Thank you for listening, guys.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.221
-BRE: Thank you for sharing.
-Thank you, Michael.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.889
BRE:
If no one else wants to go,

21:04.931 --> 21:07.016
we'll conclude
with a serenity prayer.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.606
Okay? Ready?

21:13.648 --> 21:16.109
ALL:
God,

21:16.150 --> 21:20.321
grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

21:20.363 --> 21:24.492
the courage to change
the things I can,

21:24.534 --> 21:28.454
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

21:28.496 --> 21:31.165
(crickets chirping,
distant siren wailing)

21:33.042 --> 21:34.252
(girl shrieks)

21:34.293 --> 21:37.922
-(thumping, indistinct chatter)
-(sighs)

21:37.964 --> 21:39.424
I'm completely over this day.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.217
(excited chatter)

21:41.259 --> 21:44.178
It went faster than you.

21:44.220 --> 21:47.015
(thumping, chatter continues)

21:47.056 --> 21:49.684
â™ª Ha, ha, ha... â™ª

21:50.935 --> 21:52.311
-Nein!
-(screams)

21:54.897 --> 21:56.733
(shouting)

21:58.234 --> 22:01.612
(thumping continues)

22:11.414 --> 22:13.958
â™ª Ha, ha â™ª

22:14.000 --> 22:18.629
â™ª Ha, ha, ha â™ª

22:18.671 --> 22:21.758

22:21.799 --> 22:24.594
â™ª Ha, oh, oh â™ª

22:24.635 --> 22:29.098
â™ª Oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª

22:29.140 --> 22:31.976
â™ª Oh, uh, uh â™ª

22:32.018 --> 22:34.687
â™ª Uh, uh, uh â™ª

22:34.729 --> 22:37.648
â™ª Ha, ha, ha â™ª

22:37.690 --> 22:40.985
â™ª Ha,
ha, ha â™ª

22:41.027 --> 22:43.863
â™ª Ha, ha, ha â™ª

22:43.905 --> 22:47.116
â™ª Ha,

22:47.158 --> 22:50.328
â™ª Ha, ha, ha â™ª

22:50.369 --> 22:52.622
â™ª Ha,

22:52.663 --> 22:55.458
â™ª Ha, ha, ha â™ª

22:55.500 --> 22:59.045
â™ª Ha,

22:59.087 --> 23:01.422
â™ª Ha, ha, ha. â™ª
