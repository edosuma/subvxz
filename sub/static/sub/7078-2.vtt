00:01.877 --> 00:04.463
Hi, everybody. I'm Jeff...

00:04.838 --> 00:09.927
Mr. Winger,
and this is Fundamentals of Law.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.058
Any questions? You, Red Hair.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.602
- Not gonna learn names.
- Will there be a syllabus?

00:18.894 --> 00:21.980
"Will there be a syllabus?"
Good example of a question. Moving on.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.941
- Ski Cap.
- How are we gonna be graded?

00:24.233 --> 00:25.442
Oh, no spoilers, Ski Cap.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.654
We better do names.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.240
Dave. What percent of our grade
will the final be?

00:31.532 --> 00:34.409
Come on, guys, percentages, grades,
that syllabus thing...

00:34.701 --> 00:37.412
Are we human beings
or just question-and-answer machines?

00:37.913 --> 00:39.331
We're students...

00:39.623 --> 00:41.750
and you're a teacher.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.545
Yeah.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.630
I'm a teacher.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.635
Did you see that?

00:51.927 --> 00:54.721
That teacher just leered at me.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.975
Hey, look,
it's the star of Head of the Ass.

00:58.267 --> 01:02.062
Shut up, Leonard. Nice earring. Like the
road manager for the California Raisins.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.940
What kind of teacher
talks to a student like that?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.109
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.325
Fresh meat, huh?

01:15.617 --> 01:16.868
Yeah, Jeff Winger, Law.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.540
Buzz Hickey, Criminology.
You can have that half of the office...

01:21.832 --> 01:25.544
but come spring, that corner
is stacked to the rafters with fetal pigs.

01:25.836 --> 01:29.131
I won't be here that long.
This is sort of a temporary gig for me.

01:29.423 --> 01:34.136
I get it. Teaching to make ends meet until
a real job comes along, yeah, me too.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.347
- Oh, cool. How long have you been...?
- Fifteen years.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.976
Fifteen years and counting.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.061
"Temporary gig."

01:43.687 --> 01:46.148
Oh, I like you.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.193
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

01:50.485 --> 01:53.572
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

01:53.864 --> 01:56.700
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

01:56.992 --> 02:00.912
♪ We could be roped up
Tied up dead in a year ♪

02:01.204 --> 02:05.709
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

02:06.001 --> 02:09.963
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

02:12.132 --> 02:13.842
The new table turned out great, Abed.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.345
Splendid varnishing.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.888
"Table Mark II"?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.931
I added that,
and a few custom upgrades.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.435
It's voice-activated.
Table, resume table mode.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.690
- Table, power down.
- Wait. I got a cup on there.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.609
Oh, teacher man.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.903
- Mr. Winger.
- Professor Winger.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.197
Please don't razz me
about being a teacher.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.616
Teaching's the most
noble profession in the world.

02:37.908 --> 02:41.244
Tell that to the guy that shares
my office. Fixes cuckoo clocks for fun.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.789
Sounds like Mr. Hickey,
my criminology professor.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.083
I hope you'll be a better teacher
than him.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.417
Annie, I don't know law.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.294
I wasn't a real lawyer, remember?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.630
I can't just pretend I'm teaching.

02:51.922 --> 02:52.922
I'm not MythBusters.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.927
There's a two-day course called Nicolas
Cage: Good or Bad? I'm signing up.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.514
Always wanted to know. Nicolas
is one of pop culture's great mysteries.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.349
Course on Nicolas. Mention Jesus...

03:02.641 --> 03:05.769
- to your teacher, you get a warning.
- Jesus wasn't in 70 movies.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.104
I'm in. Cage class, fun.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.272
You don't have time
to take a blow-off class.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.775
Figure out what you're gonna teach
your students.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.530
Thanks, Annie, for one glorious second,
I forgot I was a teacher.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.432 --> 03:45.517
Look at Mr. Smarty-Pants.

03:45.809 --> 03:49.020
I am so excited.
Jeff is gonna help me save the school.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.524
Not all by himself. I am learning Excel.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.693
- Jeff, do you know Excel?
- No.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.863
Well, it looks like you do.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.366
Teaching.

04:02.159 --> 04:06.538
I, as you know,
am Dramatic Professor Sean Garrity...

04:06.830 --> 04:09.624
and you are now embarking
on an odyssey of discussion...

04:09.916 --> 04:12.210
about an actor
who keeps the world asking:

04:12.502 --> 04:14.546
"Nicolas Cage, good or bad?"

04:14.838 --> 04:16.548
- Yes, young man?
- So you don't know?

04:17.214 --> 04:18.216
Mr. Nadir.

04:18.507 --> 04:23.221
Mr. Nadir drove our TV studies
professor out of his mind...

04:23.513 --> 04:26.224
by proving that there was an answer
to "Who's the boss?"

04:26.516 --> 04:28.894
- Angela.
- I admire your brain, Mr. Nadir.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.898
I did not admire Professor Sheffield...

04:33.190 --> 04:34.316
but I promise you...

04:34.608 --> 04:36.359
this question has no answer.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.572
Your homework is to watch
five Nicolas Cage films by Wednesday...

04:40.864 --> 04:41.907
no marathons.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.658
Space out your viewings.

04:43.950 --> 04:44.950
Five, that's it?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.537
Be careful, Abed Nadir.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.333
Promise me you will be careful.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.835
I have no idea
how to make a curriculum.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.254
Becoming a teacher
was a huge mistake.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.590
Without a doubt.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.551
Now, that said, there are certain perks.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.346
- Excuse me.
- I didn't know teachers could cut in line.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.640
I can experience this food
warm and disgusting.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.725
Winger, what are you doing?

05:09.017 --> 05:13.355
This line is for food,
not for Lionel Richie tickets.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.190
This is my house.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.442
Come here.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.779
This man's name is Mr. Winger...

05:22.113 --> 05:25.116
and Mr. Winger is a teacher.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.451
You know what that means?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.746
It means he gets your meatballs.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.458
Please.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.750
That's all I have.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.671
Get out of here.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.424
Place is a zoo.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.927
The trick is you gotta show
the other baboons...

05:44.219 --> 05:46.555
you got a bigger, redder ass.
Let's hit the lounge.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.938
Everybody, this is the new guy,
Winger.

05:55.230 --> 05:59.234
He's having trouble
planning his curriculum.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.903
What?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.613
Here's all you need to know:

06:03.905 --> 06:06.324
Break into groups,
grade each other's papers...

06:06.616 --> 06:10.036
and please enjoy the seven-disc
edition of Planet Earth.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.582
Is there a Mr. Winger in here?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.293
Jeffrey, we need to carve out
some time to learn Excel.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.628
Do you guys know Excel? I'm learning.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.007
You know the rules, Pelton.
Drop the cheques and move on.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.510
Jeffrey, I'm gonna boot up
my computer and download the tutor...

06:25.969 --> 06:27.929
- What was that about?
- Union rules.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.473
Management's not allowed
in the faculty lounge.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.268
I could get used to this.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.068
Nicolas Cage is so weird.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.822
I mean, he seemed scared to smell
that flower but happy to get shot.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.743
Complex performer. The Rock, Con Air,
then Face/Off. You think you understand.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.120
Then Windtalkers, Guarding Tess,
The Wicker Man.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.289
He begs you to stop watching,
but you can't.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.168
That was an odd choice.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.212
- Odd good or odd bad?
- Maybe he's just good in good movies...

07:01.504 --> 07:03.548
then acts crazy in crap
to make drug money.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.884
But is he good or bad?
Every actor is something.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.011
Robert Downey Jr., good.
Jim Belushi, bad.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.889
Van Damme, good kind of bad.
Johnny Depp, bad kind of good.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.224
There's a spectrum, and Cage is on it.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.559
I just have to find him.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.562
I'm gonna go check on Jeff.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.815
- Hello.
- Hey, Jeff.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.693
- How's the old curriculum going?
- Great.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.904
Consider our nation's youth
pre-inspired.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.073
Want a refill, Winger?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.325
- Is that Hickey?
- Yeah. Working on syllabuses.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.828
Hey, let's turd some lockers!

07:34.120 --> 07:35.163
Gotta go. Teacher thing.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.667
It's syllabi.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.378
Guterman. Dropping mad science?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.589
Elaine, take it easy
on the Oxford commas.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.926
Hey, walk, don't run, mister.
This isn't a racetrack.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.262
Okay, dangerous minds, let's break
into groups, discuss chapter one.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.725
And if you are lucky,
we might sneak in a little Planet Earth.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.017
Any questions?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.229
Just a few.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.860
She in your class, yo.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.241
So I guess...

08:11.992 --> 08:15.078
just read chapter one.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.247
Memorize
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.832
Class dismissed.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.167
Not so fast, Jeff.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.090
I assume you know
why I'm keeping you after class.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.009
Not really. Ski Cap and White Dave...

08:29.300 --> 08:31.302
- got stuff wrong too.
- You're the teacher.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.722
- You don't have to rub it in.
- What I saw today was embarrassing.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.308
You were late, you clearly had no idea...
Hey.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.020
You had no idea
what tort reform meant.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.648
I asked you to explain the Sixth,
you pled the Fifth.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.442
- I know my rights.
- No, you don't.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.734
That's the problem.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.490
Here. I gathered some materials.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.159
Tomorrow morning, before class...

08:54.451 --> 08:56.494
I need to verify
you know enough to teach.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.786
You're gonna quiz me?

08:57.996 --> 09:00.165
I wish Troy was in my class
instead of you.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.626
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.464
Hey, wait.
I warned you to separate these worlds.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.258
She's lead, we're chalk.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.678
She needs to be taken out.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.848
Of your class.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.141
I say minus her.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.893
- Minus her?
- Give her A-minuses.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.979
- Drive her nuts, she'll drop.
- She'll call me on it, report me.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.733
Teachers don't have to explain minuses.
Why do you think we invented them?

09:27.025 --> 09:28.359
She's my friend.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.529
You like the Leonard meatballs?
They added something special.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.576
It's Leonard.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.334
Come on, I'm just messing with you.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.753
You done with your bit?
I'd like my earring back.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.045
Yeah?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.216
Go get your earring,
you piece of human garbage.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.557
I know. I could just...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.146
Oh, my God.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.400
Have a working theory. Don't react
until you've heard the whole thing.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.737
If you watch closely, in Snake Eyes,
you'll notice the moment...

10:13.029 --> 10:16.491
- where an alien arm could've come...
- Abed, this isn't worth it.

10:16.783 --> 10:20.245
Maybe Nicolas Cage is just crazy.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.704
All actors are crazy, Annie.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.415
Some crazy actors are good,
some bad. None are neither.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.502
There's no such thing as both,
so which one is Nicolas Cage?

10:32.674 --> 10:37.011
Okay, so break into groups,
and then you guys quiz each other.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.390
Mr. Winger, sir,
is that really the best use of our time?

10:40.682 --> 10:42.433
Seems like the value
of having you here...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.562
I think my value as a teacher
is to teach you how to learn.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.398
- Teach ourselves?
- Won't learn if I tell you how to think.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.609
- Tell us what you think, we'll learn.
- I thought break into groups.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.362
But you failed to learn that,
so your theory's invalid.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.448
Oh, snap.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.284
Break into groups.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.954
Mr. Winger, how did you do that?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.665
- Do what?
- You won an argument against Annie.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.584
You don't argue with Annie, Garrett.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.878
You let her argue with herself
until she loses.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.296
You can win by not arguing?

11:11.588 --> 11:14.132
Yeah. Anyone that tries to argue
has already lost...

11:14.424 --> 11:16.301
because they pick
an argument to lose.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.386
I mean, that's why I never lost a case.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.639
Prosecutors beat themselves
because they... Here.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.809
Because they draw a circle...

11:25.310 --> 11:27.437
around something called the truth.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.648
And they say that
everything outside it is a lie.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.276
Annie.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.570
Don't cry. You were right.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.655
I actually might enjoy teaching.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.991
I'm not crying because of you.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.493
I got this from Professor Hickey.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.495
What the hell?
He gave you a dead rat?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.748
No, this is my
witness intimidation project.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.500
- He gave me this.
- "A-minus."

11:49.792 --> 11:51.502
I guess I overextended my schedule.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.838
I'm sorry, Jeff.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.256
I have to drop your class.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.802
Okay, thoughts on Nicolas Cage.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.347
A genius.
He keeps getting hired for some reason.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.932
It's not because of his hair.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.643
I don't know.
If I was in 70 films over 30 years...

12:06.935 --> 12:08.895
spent each one
talking at random volumes...

12:09.187 --> 12:10.855
I might accidentally win an Oscar.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.108
I think our opinions about pop culture
are fed to us by machines...

12:14.400 --> 12:16.527
- designed to criminalize autonomy.
- Good one.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.532
- Dear God.
- Abed.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.618
No, stand back. Give him space.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.376
Nicolas Cage, good or bad?

12:31.668 --> 12:35.713
A challenge, certainly,
but not unsolvable...

12:36.005 --> 12:39.634
because all actors have distinct
values, which I use to find answers.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.720
Abed,
how much Nicolas Cage did you...?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.555
Enough!

12:45.932 --> 12:49.060
I watched enough to find the answers.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.731
Because this... This is my reality,
this is how I learned to be...

12:54.023 --> 12:58.736
and my being doesn't allow
for Nicolas freaking Cage, okay?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.655
Oh, yeah.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.241
Yeah.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.042
Oh, I'm a cat.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.502
I'm a sexy cat.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.227
Abed?

13:32.478 --> 13:36.691
Think of something safe
like Holly Hunter or Don Cheadle.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.569
Abed? Abed.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.282
That was brilliant.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.703
You gave Annie an A-minus?
How could you?

13:48.995 --> 13:49.995
What were you thinking?

13:50.246 --> 13:53.875
- Are you drawing a peanut?
- It's a duck. It's none of your concern.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.626
Are you trying to cartoon?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.087
Trying and succeeding.
State your business.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.716
I wanna know what kind of monster
minuses the best student in his class.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.134
I'm a monster?

14:03.426 --> 14:06.054
I was in the storm drain lair
of the Black River Ripper.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.390
I have seen human heads
used for things other than heads.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.977
So you best not be calling me
a monster.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.313
Okay, you're a bad teacher.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.981
I got her off your back.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.776
I was handling it.
I know how to engage my students.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.987
I may not love teaching,
but I did fool around with it today.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.323
I may hook up with it again
a few more times...

14:25.615 --> 14:28.743
- even if I do dump it before Christmas.
- We do not work for them.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.078
Maybe we do.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.829
That doesn't count as an argument.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.332
Well, drawing ducks doesn't count
as cartooning.

14:34.624 --> 14:38.628
It's one duck, his name is Jim,
and publishers are interested.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.798
Ms. Edison, good news.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.343
I talked to Professor Hickey
and it turns out your project was an A.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.345
Used your connections
to change my grade?

14:47.637 --> 14:49.722
No, an A-minus means
you actually earned an A...

14:50.014 --> 14:52.892
but the teacher doesn't like you.
It's a secret faculty thing.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.394
- What?
- Are you kidding?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.021
Am I using that right?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.399
I've been busting my butt
for five years...

14:59.690 --> 15:04.112
and the whole thing comes down
to a few old losers' petty insecurities?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.114
Oligarchy.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.824
We've gotta tell people.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.702
Minuses are made-up!

15:13.496 --> 15:15.623
It's riot time!

15:15.915 --> 15:16.958
Yeah!

15:17.667 --> 15:18.793
Bring me their heads!

15:21.003 --> 15:23.005
Pop, pop!

15:29.846 --> 15:33.724
Abed? I couldn't find you at school,
so I got worried.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.144
You're throwing away
all your little movies, why?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.562
They have no value anymore.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.982
Well, if you're looking
for something to believe in...

15:41.274 --> 15:43.901
I know a skinny, little
Hebrew handyman you could meet.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.030
I'm not gonna become Christian,
Shirley, or a better Muslim.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.323
This was my religion.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.492
I thought
the meaning of people was in here.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.911
I looked inside Nicolas Cage
and I found a secret:

15:54.454 --> 15:55.913
People are random and pointless.

15:56.205 --> 16:00.251
Well, in my religion, the whole point is
you can't understand every little thing...

16:00.543 --> 16:02.670
and there's a word for people
who remind you...

16:02.962 --> 16:05.173
you're not God
and invite you to try harder.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.259
Prophets, messiahs, kung fu pandas.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.595
- So Nicolas Cage is Jesus?
- No.

16:10.887 --> 16:15.766
But he clearly works in mysterious
ways, and maybe that's just his job.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.936
That's why critics can call him
a genius or an idiot...

16:19.228 --> 16:21.898
- be right no matter what.
- Demon to some, angel to others.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.233
- Like a cenobite.
- Did you say cenobite?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.235
Yeah, cenobite, like from Hellraiser.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.613
You like Hellraiser?
You know the word?

16:28.905 --> 16:32.742
I thought Pinhead in space was a bit
of a letdown, but I'm in for the ride.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.955
Rise up, Greendale!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.291
Your teachers have been lying to you!

16:40.583 --> 16:44.170
You deserve slightly higher grades!

16:44.462 --> 16:47.173
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!

16:47.465 --> 16:49.800
- The whole world is watching this!
- Yeah!

16:50.092 --> 16:51.969
Oh, wait. I'm out of data minutes.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.140
The whole world will be watching this
on the first of next month!

16:56.432 --> 16:59.435
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!

16:59.894 --> 17:01.479
Jeffrey, do something.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.648
Distract them.
Take your shirt off. Here.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.983
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!

17:06.275 --> 17:07.984
Everybody, calm down.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.319
Just listen.

17:09.612 --> 17:13.491
Do you think the students and teachers
at Harvard are at each other's throats?

17:13.782 --> 17:16.493
No. Because they're all rich.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.829
We all have something in common too.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.415
We all suck.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.125
We're all broke.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.963
We just went through
an entire week of meatball lunches...

17:27.255 --> 17:28.839
without even blinking.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.884
Oh, that's on me. I converted
the lunch menu to a spreadsheet.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.512
The teachers here are teachers here...

17:34.804 --> 17:39.183
because they did something wrong,
same as the students.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.644
So get on the same team...

17:41.936 --> 17:43.688
because, take it from me...

17:43.980 --> 17:48.359
those of us that get to leave
aren't going anywhere.

17:52.655 --> 17:53.655
No, you suck!

17:54.657 --> 17:56.867
Jeffrey,
go with my "take off your shirt" plan.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.830
May I point out
that you're doing this together?

18:01.372 --> 18:04.458
It's all based on rows and columns
of cells.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.377
I think that's why they call it Excel.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.046
- I don't care.
- Okay, now, I know it's unrealistic...

18:09.338 --> 18:11.340
to think
we can eliminate riots completely.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.259
But I've been crunching the numbers.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.929
- We can reduce them by 40 percent.
- Let's hope the man doesn't target you...

18:17.221 --> 18:19.390
- for dreaming this big.
- Here's my plan.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.893
You know that Save Greendale
Committee you pretended to form?

18:23.185 --> 18:24.604
We need one of those for real.

18:24.895 --> 18:28.232
I want a student-teacher alliance,
with you in charge.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.484
- I vote myself out.
- You don't have a quorum.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.573
And don't forget, if I fire you, you're
likely to starve and die, so, you know.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.908
Do you want me to cut your meatball?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.203
All right, look...

18:42.455 --> 18:44.707
there are two things I don't do well:

18:44.999 --> 18:47.209
Apologies and drawing duck bills.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.878
I lost perspective.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.463
Students aren't the enemy...

18:50.755 --> 18:53.591
and, I don't know,
maybe my bills are a little pointy...

18:53.883 --> 18:55.426
maybe I'm basing them on beaks.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.261
Apologise to Annie.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.597
I did, I gave her an A.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.642
I don't know how else to make it right.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.937
I guess, I don't know, I quit.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.108
I got a better idea.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.070
As our first order of business
for the Student/Teacher...

19:14.362 --> 19:16.947
Save Greendale Committee,
we hereby ban the dean...

19:17.239 --> 19:18.908
from attending future meetings.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.411
- Yeah.
- Our second order of business: Lunch.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.121
Yeah.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.929
I'm taste-testing rations
for the shelter I'm digging.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.306
Are you the coolest person
in the world?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.558
- I doubt it.
- I'd like to address the fact...

19:44.850 --> 19:46.977
that there are no
Asian-Americans represented.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.479
We can get Chang.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.982
No need to rush into anything,
I just wanted to address it.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.652
Anybody want some nuts?

20:18.968 --> 20:21.804
- Quiet, I think Jeff's coming.
- This is gonna be hilarious.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.109
Yeah, pharmacy please.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.528
Yeah, this is Buzz Hickey.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.780
I think you gave me
the wrong medication.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.782
I usually get Lipitor.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.994
What do you mean my insurance
won't cover it anymore?

20:45.286 --> 20:48.581
My body does not respond well
to the generic stuff.

20:48.873 --> 20:52.042
Let me ask you a question, lady,
can you pay out-of-pocket?

20:52.334 --> 20:56.213
I am an educator, ma'am,
living on a teacher's salary.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.716
No, I'm sorry.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.217
What's your name?

21:00.509 --> 21:04.472
Leia. Well, let me tell you something,
Leia.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.057
I wake up every night screaming.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.186
Life is unfair,
but it's the only thing we g...

21:10.478 --> 21:13.397
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll call back later.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.281
Ma, it's Buzz.
I'm gonna say this as fast as I can.

21:22.573 --> 21:25.409
We can't afford to bury dad
with the rest of the family.
