<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

01:11.160 --> 01:13.606
My darling daughter.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.367
The most beautiful girl in the world!

01:23.480 --> 01:27.007
A marvellous necklace from Paris!

01:27.080 --> 01:29.924
The most expensive necklace.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.485
Enjoy the party!

02:00.120 --> 02:02.168
What about austerity, Apo?

02:02.240 --> 02:03.730
This is austerity.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.201
You should have seen
our country five years ago.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.961
- Tomorrow is business?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.165
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned
you can't deliver the material you promised.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.961
- I wouldn't worry about that, Apo. It'll be fine.
- I hope so.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.606
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.806
How good to see you.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.684
Oh, my goodness! Oh, Lord!

02:32.760 --> 02:34.364
Oh, Lord, what's happening here?

02:44.320 --> 02:45.731
<i>Que pasa? Que pasa?
Dime que demonios pasa.</i>

02:48.200 --> 02:50.362
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

03:04.000 --> 03:05.286
Jesus!

03:05.360 --> 03:07.328
Roper, help me please.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.484
Careful.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.441
Elena. Elena.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.046
Elena! Elena! Elena!

03:28.720 --> 03:31.166
She must have been in so much pain.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.287
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of
other people pain too.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.491
I'll have to reschedule that meeting.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.969
Still, the canapes were good.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.368
What do you want to do
about our Arab chum?

03:46.440 --> 03:47.601
Bring him out to the villa?

03:47.840 --> 03:52.129
I don't much like that. It's too risky
if someone's got a watch on him.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.285
Invite him to the children's party.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.282
There'll be lots of people there.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.681
You can do your magic tricks,

03:59.760 --> 04:01.683
try and get them right.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.882
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.721
Sorry, darling. That was a...

04:06.800 --> 04:08.962
I don't know what I was thinking.
That was a crass thing to say.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.206
OK. Let's go, dream boy.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.450
Boo.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.365
Come on.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.530
To the left.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.686
Up the stairs.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.731
So the silly sod is insisting on 10%,

05:14.920 --> 05:16.729
and he's digging his heels in.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.121
- All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week.
Mmm-hmm.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.247
And then we'll take it away from him.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.164
OK, that's fine.
Happy to go with that.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.085
Ah, there he is.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.568
Dans, you're on.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.125
Thank you very much, sir,

05:38.200 --> 05:39.804
for rescuing me.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.007
I hope you're feeling better.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.164
You're very welcome.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.966
All right, now scram.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.088
See if you can catch us some
mackerel for supper.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.491
And take the dogs, will you?

05:54.240 --> 05:57.722
Go on, Charlie, go on.
You foul-smelling creature.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.486
- You'll call him, will you?
- Yeah, leave it with me. I'll deal with it.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.767
Don't waste any energy
trying to sweet-talk him,

06:03.840 --> 06:05.046
just let him sweat.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.361
All right.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.005
All right, Frisky,

06:14.080 --> 06:16.082
no more interruptions, no one on the terrace.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.447
What the hell is that noise?

06:18.520 --> 06:19.726
Uh, Javier's blowing leaves.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.290
Tell him to knock it off, will you?

06:23.080 --> 06:24.206
Cease and desist.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.930
How's the face?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.521
It's fine.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.766
You'll be all right.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.765
So, what do you want?

06:49.840 --> 06:53.208
I'd like to go back to the restaurant,
if that's all right.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.647
That's not what I meant.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.846
What do you want from the world?

07:01.640 --> 07:02.721
I don't know.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.486
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.130
Don't believe you.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.484
You've never relaxed in your life.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.361
If you say so.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.646
Just sit down.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.164
Everyone assumes

07:19.320 --> 07:21.766
that I was born with
a silver spoon in my mouth.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.806
It's balls.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.008
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer,

07:26.080 --> 07:28.447
taught me the price of everything.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.249
But the drive to create all of this,

07:31.280 --> 07:32.930
that comes from me and me alone.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.448
Where does it come from in you?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.764
I'm not sure I have what you describe.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.000
OK, you patched me up.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.329
I'm very grateful for that.
And now I'd like to go.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.641
Corky can't make you out, you see.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.250
Suspicious chap, Corks.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.890
He's got bad vibes about you.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.564
Why'd you kill that fellow in Devon?

07:55.480 --> 07:56.925
It's all over the wire.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.282
We had to call the police. No choice.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.089
Be here any minute.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.847
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.086
He cheated me.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.446
You didn't like that?

08:13.520 --> 08:15.887
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.968
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.044
So, that makes 12 tonight.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.161
Or 13.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.169
Come and tell us why you think
this one's a bad apple, Corky.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.284
Well, his references aren't too clever.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.764
Luckily for you, although Jorge was
so desperate for a sous-chef,

08:38.840 --> 08:41.047
he didn't bother to check them.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.009
Did you fake them, Pine?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.646
I needed the job.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.045
I needed it fast.
I didn't have time for formalities.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.446
Where did you get the passport?

08:50.360 --> 08:52.522
I met a girl in Devon.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.090
Didn't we all?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.525
Pretty little thing.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.890
And who's Quince?

09:02.840 --> 09:04.205
Her ex.

09:04.840 --> 09:05.921
He'd never been abroad.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.526
He'd never had a passport.
So I took his name.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.004
Taken a lot of names, haven't you?

09:11.640 --> 09:13.881
Makes a man wonder who you really are.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.201
So, father killed in Belfast.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.004
No close relationship with mother.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.970
Married once, for six months,
we can assume, not a triumph.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.171
Two tours in Iraq. Distinguished service.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.049
And on return, what?

09:30.120 --> 09:31.531
Despair? Depression?

09:31.600 --> 09:34.331
And five years as a night owl
in the hotel business.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.767
What was that? Hibernation?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.043
Burying yourself alive?

09:39.920 --> 09:42.241
And then a sudden moment of madness.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.764
Thieving, narcotics...

09:45.600 --> 09:47.011
Murder.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.447
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.450
Do you even know who you are?

09:56.720 --> 09:59.326
Those two chaps you smashed up
in the restaurant. Did you know them?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.201
No.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.241
Had they eaten there before?

10:03.320 --> 10:04.685
Do they look like they'd eaten there before?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.131
Ever sailed a boat for them?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.281
Is this some kind of interrogation?

10:07.360 --> 10:10.125
Let's pretend it is. Did you cook for them?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.201
No.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.611
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.331
So you weren't the lookout guy,
you didn't switch roles halfway through?

10:15.400 --> 10:17.641
- No.
- It's another one of Corky's little theories.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.848
Listen, I haven't asked
for anything, all right?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.285
I don't expect a reward,

10:21.360 --> 10:24.887
I certainly don't appreciate this
investigation into my personal life,

10:24.960 --> 10:27.042
and frankly I'm bored of your hospitality.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.405
Maybe I'm not squeaky clean.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.523
But nor, I suspect, are you
and your little friend here,

10:33.600 --> 10:34.931
so maybe just leave it at that.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.481
- Little friend?
- I know.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.451
Cha'mone!

10:43.760 --> 10:45.364
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.851
What are you gonna do for a passport?

10:48.160 --> 10:51.289
I have a passport,
in the name of Thomas Quince.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.441
Where is it?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.971
Corky, sock him the bad news.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.528
The passport's gone, old love.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.490
- Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.403
It's no good getting in a paddy, my dear.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.848
Your cover's blown sky-high.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.209
Tom Quince is on every wanted list
on God's earth.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.765
Murder, theft,

11:10.840 --> 11:13.241
sadly, not buggery, but we'll work on that.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.966
That was my passport. That was mine!

11:16.680 --> 11:18.842
You're going to have to learn
to be someone else, aren't you?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.923
I said no one in here!

11:23.720 --> 11:26.200
Sorry, baby, I didn't know. Jesus!

11:26.280 --> 11:28.248
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.489
It's actually good news.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.567
Thomas is going to be staying
for a while, till he's fighting fit again.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.967
Oh. That's great.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.044
Do you want to come for a swim?

11:40.560 --> 11:41.971
Go on.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.447
Corky can lend you some Speedos.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.450
I'd like to.

11:47.720 --> 11:51.566
Corky, we should put him in the fisherman's
cottage at the end of the estate.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.044
While we work out what to do with you.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.091
- All right, boss.
- And what am I supposed to do until then?

11:57.440 --> 11:59.010
You could keep Dans company.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.328
He was supposed to have
a schoolfriend here for the holiday,

12:01.400 --> 12:02.526
but the bugger stood him up.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.249
Mother doesn't approve of me.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.445
One more thing.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.284
I run a tight ship here.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.370
You're right.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.648
We do a little swashbuckling
every now and then,

12:15.720 --> 12:17.609
but we play straight with each other.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.283
Now you saved my boy, and I'm grateful.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.528
But if you step out of line,
I will make you howl for your mother.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.445
What size feet have you got?

12:35.520 --> 12:36.567
Twelve.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.766
Hmm.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.243
Now, house rules.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.767
No phones, no postcards
to Devon dumplings.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.602
No messages in a bottle.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.203
The chief values privacy, as do we all.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.726
All the way down to the beach,
as far as you can go,

13:01.240 --> 13:02.605
then it's on the right.

13:03.480 --> 13:07.644
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones,

13:07.720 --> 13:09.688
walk into the sea,

13:09.760 --> 13:11.603
and keep going.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.365
Anything?

13:34.960 --> 13:36.121
No.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.885
Bloody hell, I hate this bit.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.842
Off every tree you may freely eat.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.369
Maids, serving wenches,

14:31.440 --> 14:33.886
cooks, typists, masseuses,

14:34.320 --> 14:37.688
even the lady that comes
to clip the canary's claws.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.722
But if you lay one hand
on that precious fruit,

14:42.800 --> 14:45.929
then like the Belgians in the Congo,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.923
we'll chop it off.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.288
And I don't mean the hand.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.809
Señor Roper?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.167
Morning.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.690
I was wondering
if I might take Danny into town?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.440
What for?

15:35.720 --> 15:37.006
A change.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.646
He likes you, doesn't he?

15:43.840 --> 15:45.285
I hope so.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.805
I like him.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.842
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.721
Pine.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.331
Thank you.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.646
It's me. They're on the move.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.124
Do you always have
this much company, Danny?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.483
Since the restaurant.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.048
- That's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.130
Whee!

17:15.880 --> 17:18.121
It's OK. It's all right.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.805
Danny.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.086
Yeah?

17:26.160 --> 17:29.004
What do you say to an ice cream?

17:29.080 --> 17:30.411
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.005
Great. Actually...

17:34.680 --> 17:37.286
Why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby...

17:37.360 --> 17:39.442
...if they want an ice cream as well, eh?

17:39.520 --> 17:40.965
OK.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.730
Would you like an ice cream?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.643
Really?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.722
- Would you?
- No.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.611
They don't want one.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.364
- They don't want one?
- No.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.329
They are very strange,
aren't they, those two?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.926
Yeah, especially on a day like this.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.321
Who wouldn't want an ice cream?

17:59.400 --> 18:01.641
- What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.408
Uh, <i>dos pistachos por favor.</i>

18:11.080 --> 18:12.684
Danny?

18:12.760 --> 18:14.649
- Yeah?
- Do you know who's, erm,

18:14.720 --> 18:16.882
coming to the party on Sunday?

18:17.800 --> 18:20.883
It's a select group, around 25.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.088
Erm, <i>señor, por favor.</i> Sorry.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.642
I need to hear the complete list.
All the names of all your ice creams.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.207
Oh, <i>gracias.</i> Sorry.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.726
That's all right.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.249
I think Sandy and Caroline

18:35.320 --> 18:37.641
will probably be there, won't they?

18:39.200 --> 18:40.690
I don't know who's coming.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.762
You see, I've got this problem.
It's Major Corkoran.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.209
I don't think he likes me very much.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.282
- Why not?
- I don't know.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.242
But he's trying to find out
everything he can about me.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.970
All the way back to the time
of the ancient Egyptians.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.081
Mmm.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.685
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

19:23.920 --> 19:25.809
Right. Waiting's over.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.087
We've got a spot of work to do, thank God.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.002
So how often do you come here?

19:36.080 --> 19:37.411
Only in the summer.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.562
Must be nice
to see your dad, though?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.608
Do you play tennis with him?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.251
I have lessons with Luis.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.731
Roper's not here much.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.371
Well, I expect he works hard, eh?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.081
That's why he has such a big house.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.844
Oh, I bet you've counted the rooms.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.528
Twenty three. There's three kitchens
and the big office by the pool.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.206
And there's Roper's secret study
in his bedroom,

20:01.280 --> 20:03.328
but no one's allowed in there.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.083
Except you, special guest?

20:07.160 --> 20:09.845
I'm not. He calls it the citadel.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.964
And there's one key. And he hides it.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.530
Do you know what's inside?

20:16.160 --> 20:18.049
He says it's full of peppermints.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.843
Well, I'd lock it up too, if I were him.

20:25.880 --> 20:29.168
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.242
You have to be really careful.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.601
Why?

20:33.680 --> 20:36.126
This is where I cut my foot last year.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.843
Roper made me stand in the sea
for about half an hour,

20:39.920 --> 20:41.365
because of the salt.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.487
Ever since his daughter
killed herself, he comes here every day.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.210
And that's not all.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.126
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline
at the Madrid public prosecutor's office,

21:01.200 --> 21:04.682
says he has information regarding
a world-class illegal arms deal.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.167
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.403
Assumption, a priest's advice
only goes so far.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.644
<i>- Gracias, padre.
- Nada.</i>

21:27.480 --> 21:28.970
Mr Apostol.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.565
Who are you?

21:31.160 --> 21:33.766
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.931
I can't sleep.

21:39.760 --> 21:43.970
Every night, I ask myself
the same question...

21:45.680 --> 21:47.250
What I could have done?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.168
Now you're having a child...

21:57.640 --> 22:00.041
You can understand how I feel.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.724
Yeah, I can, Juan.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.723
But when you called the Madrid office,

22:05.800 --> 22:07.450
you had blood on your hands.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.402
And I'm here to wash it off.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.201
How?

22:14.840 --> 22:16.330
You know Richard Roper?

22:16.560 --> 22:17.721
Yes.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.770
He's a friend.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.842
Juan, he's not a friend.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.968
He dragged you down
and he dragged your daughter down, too.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.842
If Roper wasn't in your life,
I think she'd still be alive today.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.251
I'm sorry.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.330
Now God knows how you bear it.
I, I don't think I could.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.764
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.483
We're good people.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.246
We play it straight
and we keep our promises, OK?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.731
But I need your help.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.164
Do you know Lance Corkoran?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.371
Yes.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.441
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.725
Right. Well, that's what needs to change.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.245
Are you pink?

23:23.960 --> 23:27.646
Socialist, left wing, march of history,
that sort of thing?

23:28.880 --> 23:32.123
Wouldn't bother me if you were.
It's another one of Corky's bugbears.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.329
He seems to have a few.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.001
Yeah.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.168
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.126
Once spent a week together
in a police cell in Delhi.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.641
Don't think I've ever laughed
so much in my whole life.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.050
Was he drinking then?

23:52.960 --> 23:55.611
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.406
What business is it of yours
how much he drinks?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.403
When my father was serving in Belfast...

24:03.040 --> 24:05.566
a sergeant in his platoon
got drunk one night,

24:05.640 --> 24:08.689
told a local girl
what the next day's operation was.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.808
The man I loved most in the world was dead

24:11.880 --> 24:14.611
for five pints of lager
and the promise of a quickie.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.243
Right. So you don't drink and you're not pink.
What are you?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.245
Me, I'm a free man.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.521
Free to think, free to work.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.721
Free to climb a mountain,

24:29.800 --> 24:31.882
or lie in bed all day
eating peppermint creams,

24:31.960 --> 24:33.689
without any bugger telling me how.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.365
Then I'm a free man.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.091
Oh, that's the free part.
The man part's a little different.

24:40.160 --> 24:44.051
You see, children grow up
thinking the adult world is ordered,

24:44.120 --> 24:46.930
rational, fit for purpose.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.560
It's crap.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.366
Becoming a man is realising

24:52.080 --> 24:53.889
that it's all rotten.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.722
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness,

24:56.800 --> 24:58.404
that's freedom.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.051
Here we are.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.281
Out we get.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.642
Come on. Chop, chop. Let's go.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.805
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

25:24.320 --> 25:25.890
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

25:26.520 --> 25:27.681
Uh, <i>Señor.</i>

25:27.760 --> 25:30.331
The bags, please. Thank you so much.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.127
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.204
Carol, you look divine, as ever.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.362
Sandy, sort of acceptable.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.930
Apo, my dear old friend.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.809
I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.245
Thanks.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.209
How are you? I can't even imagine.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.362
Mr Barghati,
thank you so much for coming.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.885
Please come inside.

25:59.960 --> 26:04.090
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you
before we get down to business.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.442
And did you get the sweater?

26:35.400 --> 26:36.640
Great.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.085
Does it fit?

26:40.880 --> 26:42.006
Mmm.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.442
OK. Bye.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.807
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.202
The guests are arriving
and the party's gonna start soon.

27:26.120 --> 27:30.682
The story begins in Egypt,
four-and-a-half thousand years ago.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.011
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.088
This is literally the
oldest trick in the book.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.051
Now, we start with a ball.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.122
We have one, two, three cups.

27:42.560 --> 27:46.531
We turn one cup like that,
one cup like that, one cup like that.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.884
All right, now, I'm gonna take the ball,

27:50.560 --> 27:53.086
and I'm gonna place the ball in the cup.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.367
Shake the cup,

27:55.440 --> 27:56.726
turn it over.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.563
Right, now. You've to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.120
I'm going to move these two round like that,

28:04.200 --> 28:06.123
and this one round like that.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.725
Everybody clear where the ball is now?

28:07.800 --> 28:10.804
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?

28:11.320 --> 28:12.765
No, Danny, the ball is in the middle.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.650
You're not watching the cups, Danny.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.211
Thomas is watching the cups,
aren't you, Thomas?

28:21.520 --> 28:23.488
You're a gym bunny.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.403
I am.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.323
You're a cold gym bunny.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.330
He can't stop his mouth, in every way.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.729
Corky can get a little
over-excited when he's drunk.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.168
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati
is worried about.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.885
According to my friends,
he has been shooting his mouth off,

28:42.960 --> 28:45.167
talking about things he should not.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.329
Barghati doesn't
want him involved.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.811
Condition of the deal.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.684
Thanks for that, Apo.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.004
Come. Come with me. It's a funny thing to do.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.764
If you want to piss...

28:58.840 --> 29:00.330
I am so sorry to interrupt.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.925
But can I just borrow
the old man for a second?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.445
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.329
- Excuse me.
- Bye.Bye.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.567
I've just spoken to Apo. He has...

29:08.640 --> 29:10.722
There you go, Danny.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.321
Thomas.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.289
For God's sake.

29:22.680 --> 29:26.651
Roper, Thomas and I are gonna
go for a little stroll.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.449
All right, darling.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.044
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here
with some friends of Dorothy,

29:37.120 --> 29:39.726
that I would like to have
escorted from the premises.

29:39.800 --> 29:42.565
You and Tabby can make as much
noise as you like, right?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.651
...If you need to relieve yourself,

29:47.160 --> 29:50.642
it's good to do it into
a suitable perspective.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.290
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?

29:52.360 --> 29:54.044
God's urinal, I call it.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.084
Break it up, you're giving the boss
indigestion with your buddies here.

29:57.160 --> 30:00.050
Come on, lads, party's over.
Leave your drinks here.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.126
Frisky, don't be too rough.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.449
Who are all these people?

30:20.520 --> 30:22.363
How should I know?

30:24.560 --> 30:25.800
You're not curious?

30:25.960 --> 30:28.566
Why should I be? It's business.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.530
Which is what?

30:31.400 --> 30:32.731
Buying and selling...

30:33.600 --> 30:35.602
Agricultural equipment.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.523
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.363
That'd drive me insane.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.643
You shouldn't have seen me like that today,
in my bedroom.

30:46.880 --> 30:50.202
I'm sorry. The door was open,

30:50.280 --> 30:52.726
- I thought you were dressed.
- That's not what I meant.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.121
I don't care who sees me naked.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.168
I do care who sees me crying.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.084
You tell no one you saw that, is that clear?

31:01.440 --> 31:02.601
Of course.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.480
I'm going swimming.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.121
Wanna come?

31:11.760 --> 31:15.048
Er, I don't think that would be wise.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.884
There's no current.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.200
That's not quite what I meant.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.650
I know it wasn't.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.010
There she goes.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.602
Beyond the ha-ha!

31:47.400 --> 31:50.051
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.050
Er... Come.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.241
Rex, do you have a minute?

33:10.680 --> 33:13.490
The Permanent Secretary
would love to see you.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.722
Erm, yes.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.531
- Was that a yes or a no?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.323
Rex, come in.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.044
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.610
- And his team from the River.
- Rex.

33:40.720 --> 33:44.088
Barbara Vandon, from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my under secretary.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.083
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?

33:46.280 --> 33:49.409
- Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
- Limpet?

33:49.520 --> 33:53.525
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation,
with Angela Burr on side-saddle.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.967
Yes, I know what Limpet is.
It's an enforcement case,

33:56.040 --> 33:59.249
nothing to do with Langley, or River House.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.971
Well, it's what Barbara feels
we ought to be discussing.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.528
Rex, Langley has been
completely railroaded on this.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.565
Currently, we have
a joint operation on foreign soil

34:08.639 --> 34:11.849
between two extremely fringe outfits.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.127
They're chasing international arms

34:15.199 --> 34:17.965
in an area of the world that is...

34:18.040 --> 34:19.610
Way beyond their comprehension.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.199
It's crazy.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.248
I have to say I agree.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.641
Limpet is operating
in a highly incendiary region.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.609
And I would hate to see that
run out of control.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.922
I mean, in my view, it should be placed
under a purely Intelligence jurisdiction...

34:34.000 --> 34:36.081
Acting on a political brief.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.520
But it's not my decision.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.965
No, it's not.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.286
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
or your team that my recommendation,

34:46.360 --> 34:48.442
uh, accepted by the Permanent Secretary,

34:48.520 --> 34:50.329
was that River House was over-extended,

34:50.920 --> 34:53.002
and that enforcement agencies
were urgently needed

34:53.080 --> 34:56.163
to prosecute any areas
of international criminal activity

34:56.239 --> 35:00.131
that were, for whatever reason,
slipping through the Intelligence net.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.723
In that context,
I find the actions of River House

35:03.800 --> 35:06.007
somewhat inimical to the new era

35:06.080 --> 35:09.289
of parliamentary accountability
and transparency.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.884
Does that
answer your question?

35:13.960 --> 35:16.281
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.323
Have you got a moment?

35:30.160 --> 35:32.561
Ah, not much more than that.
Celia's cooking rabbit.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.722
That's all it will take.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.530
Good job in there.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.968
Pressed all the right buttons,
accountability, transparency.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.010
I don't like being bullied. Never have.

35:44.760 --> 35:48.207
See, the thing is, I'm not sure
that Limpet is quite the abject failure

35:48.280 --> 35:50.601
that Angela Burr would have us believe.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.761
Really?

35:51.840 --> 35:55.447
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours,

35:55.920 --> 36:00.084
you get an uncle in Switzerland
who has suffered an untimely death.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.206
A rich uncle.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.284
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.409
You're in over your head, Rex.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.840
- Don't tell me...
- Don't answer now.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.731
Think about it.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.730
Enjoy the rabbit.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.050
- Morning.
- Hi.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.370
- You're not swimming?
- Not in the mood.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.649
I like you, Thomas.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.680
You see everything and say nothing.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.569
My husband is screwing our nanny.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.847
What a cliché.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.767
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.649
But the agency only had stunners.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.650
Could you do my back?

37:17.840 --> 37:19.763
Don't worry. I don't want to sleep with you.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.285
Why's he keeping you here?

37:31.560 --> 37:34.040
- I don't know.
- Grooming you, is he?

37:36.320 --> 37:37.606
For what?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.604
You just be careful.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.281
Roper's planning a big arms deal
to Apo's Lebanese friend.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.167
Weapons from seven British
and American companies.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.806
Weapons no one should be trading in.

38:00.680 --> 38:04.366
Roper's using a company called
Tradepass to fence the deal.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.767
He pretends it trades
in agricultural equipment.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.764
His investors pretend to believe him.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.120
You can stop rubbing now.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.766
Why are you telling me this?

38:23.200 --> 38:26.522
I just want to be honest
with someone in this world.

38:28.560 --> 38:29.607
Does Jed know?

38:29.680 --> 38:32.445
No. Of course not.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.763
Sandy screws everyone
and tells me everything.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.162
Roper is steadfastly faithful
and tells Jed nothing.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.485
Do you think I should tell her?

38:47.920 --> 38:49.081
Maybe.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.123
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.361
He knew what he was getting into.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.405
Did he?

39:15.880 --> 39:20.204
So, you and Mr Burr... Making a go of it?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.966
Well, you know, like my mum says,
"You make your bed, you die in it."

39:26.080 --> 39:29.482
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.

39:30.920 --> 39:31.921
Listen.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.522
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation.
Please.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.682
Well, you can't deny the past.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.081
- The past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.966
Joel...

39:46.400 --> 39:49.165
You silly sod.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.526
Hi, Corky.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.525
Frisky.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.325
Hey, Danny.

40:05.560 --> 40:08.291
Thomas, have you seen my phone?

40:10.680 --> 40:12.364
I haven't. Sorry.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.850
Dad'll be cross.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.565
Everyone's cross.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.483
And Jed’s not talking to Dad.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.608
What's going on?

40:25.360 --> 40:26.600
I don't know.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.966
I tell you what, why don't I come downstairs

40:33.040 --> 40:35.771
and read you a bedtime story, and we can
look for your phone in the morning?

40:36.040 --> 40:37.326
- Okay.
- Yeah?

40:37.400 --> 40:40.244
Yeah. What shall we read?

40:40.320 --> 40:43.051
Don't know.
Which one's your favourite?

40:43.720 --> 40:45.529
The Three Little Pigs.

40:45.640 --> 40:50.202
Little Pigs? I can give
you the Thomas version of Two Little Pigs.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.164
What's that?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.730
That right there. Punch that out.
Punch that out.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.805
What is it?

41:32.560 --> 41:34.085
It's your boy.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.960
Seven tractor firms.
Seven armament manufacturers.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.206
Home sale with best friend,
that's UK and US.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.521
Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.523
Worst Man's Roper. Roper's the middle man.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.889
- What's Tradepass?
- Not sure. Must be a front organisation.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.962
What I do know, though, is
Roper's pressed the green light.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.167
Right.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.969
Hey, guys?

41:58.000 --> 42:02.528
Okay, so just put the cases by the taxi
and then you can jump in.

42:03.400 --> 42:04.811
Good girl. Pop in. jump in.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.004
Okay, put your seatbelts on, guys.

42:23.840 --> 42:24.887
Okay.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.924
Okay.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.365
Here we go.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.526
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!

42:37.600 --> 42:39.204
- Caroline... Caroline!
- You bitch!

42:39.280 --> 42:42.045
For Christ's sake, she's going,
she's going. She's go...

42:42.720 --> 42:43.881
- Caro...
- Bitch!

42:44.520 --> 42:45.931
- Whore!
- Caroline!

42:46.000 --> 42:47.001
- Just shut up!
- All right.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.287
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!

42:52.920 --> 42:54.331
Do you like the show?

42:58.360 --> 43:00.567
Do you like the show, Dicky?

43:01.360 --> 43:02.885
Dicky Roper!

43:11.120 --> 43:12.121
See you later, guys.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.847
- Jed, darling...
- Don't even...

43:51.400 --> 43:53.289
Where is everybody?

43:53.360 --> 43:54.850
- Monaco.
- Oh.

43:54.920 --> 43:57.844
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.841
And you're not, uh... You're not going too?

44:01.360 --> 44:02.600
Not me, no.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.364
The girl was supposed to go,
but she's blown him out.

44:05.440 --> 44:08.603
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.526
Didn't she invite you? Oh, dear.

44:11.600 --> 44:14.251
Very good. Well, have a nice time.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.610
I’ll just be a minute.

47:21.920 --> 47:23.126
What are you doing in here?

47:25.440 --> 47:26.680
I brought you some flowers.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.971
Why didn't you give them to the maids?

47:33.760 --> 47:35.410
- I have to change.
- Close the door.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.369
You can't be in here.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.280
This is our bedroom.

48:02.920 --> 48:03.921
What is that?

48:07.800 --> 48:09.040
I found it on the desktop.

48:10.480 --> 48:14.121
You broke into his office
and you spied on his papers.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.524
You have to be more careful.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.163
Darling, angel, sweet cheeks,

48:29.240 --> 48:30.685
everyone's starving.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.250
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.

48:34.760 --> 48:35.886
Are you decent?

48:40.800 --> 48:42.882
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'm coming.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.530
How was your trip?

49:32.640 --> 49:34.961
Noisy. I hitched a ride on a C130.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.281
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?

49:37.360 --> 49:40.489
Fine, thank you.
Not sure why we had to make it.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.849
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?

49:43.920 --> 49:46.810
Well, Halo is not too keen
on intermediaries just now.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.000
And yet he sent you?

49:50.040 --> 49:52.008
There's an enforcement
operation called Limpet.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.730
We have to keep our eyes on it.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.290
Halo says you need to be careful.

49:55.920 --> 49:57.684
I am always careful.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.321
How far have they got?

49:59.800 --> 50:02.167
They've drawn a line between
Langbourne and Apostol.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.322
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?

50:05.880 --> 50:07.086
Photograph of a meeting.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.004
They after buyers or sellers?

50:10.080 --> 50:12.003
We don't know. We assume both.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.924
You can assure Halo that we have
taken every precaution.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.722
We have received intelligence of our own.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.164
We are changing the guard.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.561
Good.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.208
<i>How was your meeting?</i>

50:44.360 --> 50:45.361
It was fine.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.691
- It was fine.
- Don't be so bloody childish.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.808
Look, Caro was upset.

50:52.880 --> 50:56.123
She wanted to get back at Sandy,
so she started spreading manure.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.770
That's it. End of story.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.604
That's what it is? It's just a story?

50:59.920 --> 51:02.161
Jesus Jed, what the hell
is the matter with you?

51:02.240 --> 51:04.129
<i>Tell me why I should believe you.</i>

51:04.600 --> 51:06.125
Why shouldn't you believe me?

51:06.760 --> 51:07.966
<i>When have I ever lied to you?</i>

51:08.040 --> 51:09.121
Oh, you don't lie to me.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.241
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.

51:12.520 --> 51:13.885
What? What do I hide?

51:13.960 --> 51:15.246
The truth, Roper.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.608
What about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?

51:17.680 --> 51:19.523
I don't hide anything from you.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.444
You have a child, Jed! You have a son.

51:24.120 --> 51:26.043
<i>Let's start with him.</i>

51:26.800 --> 51:29.007
<i>Or don't you think he counts?</i>

51:34.120 --> 51:35.485
How do you know that?

51:35.560 --> 51:37.801
We're not talking how, we're talking why.

51:37.880 --> 51:39.325
Why would you hide that from me?

51:39.400 --> 51:40.890
That was not included in the brochure.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.361
Screw your brochure, Roper.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.526
You don't own me.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.968
No one is entitled to know things about me
that I don't want them to know.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.566
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?

51:51.680 --> 51:53.842
I can read a bloody bank statement.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.762
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.451
Now anyone listening to this
phone call knows it too.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.370
Apart from that, how was your day?

53:22.480 --> 53:24.926
On your feet, soldier.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.684
Where the hell did he get that?

53:43.560 --> 53:45.642
- Halo?
- Yeah.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.767
They're back?

53:58.880 --> 54:00.450
Apparently so.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.521
Chief wants to see you.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.570
Not you. Him.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.201
Present for you. On the table.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.362
- Thank you.
- Told them to put visas in it,

54:43.440 --> 54:44.566
make it look scruffy.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.764
Never trust a new passport, in my view.

54:46.840 --> 54:48.808
Always go with the old 'uns.

54:48.880 --> 54:52.885
Like third-world taxi drivers.
There's a reason they've survived.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.326
Andrew Birch.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.280
We liked the tree thing,
thought we'd stick with that.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.203
It's all official. You are reborn.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.923
Visas are real. If you want to renew,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.367
do it at a consulate abroad, less risky.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.646
What's up?

55:12.760 --> 55:15.206
I thought that was my, uh, present.

55:15.560 --> 55:19.167
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.046
Right.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.970
Sandy, papers.

55:23.480 --> 55:24.891
Mmm-hmm.

55:25.440 --> 55:26.726
I'm going to need a witness.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.771
Preferably Spanish, so they
can't actually read the bloody thing.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.484
I'll get Carlos.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.321
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.

55:33.400 --> 55:35.323
Wait, what... what is this? What am I signing?

55:35.400 --> 55:39.086
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run,
you're pretty bloody picky.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.291
I am giving you your own company.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.722
Uh, look, I don't know
anything about running a company.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.850
Don't have to.

55:53.800 --> 55:57.771
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.964
Why don't you practise
a few signatures, get the feel of it?

56:07.800 --> 56:09.165
Andrew Birch.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.370
B-I-R... C for Charlie.

56:12.440 --> 56:13.771
H for Hotel.

56:17.320 --> 56:18.321
Go on. A manly one.

56:18.400 --> 56:19.765
Go for a manly one.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.166
Andrew Birch in a hurry.

56:22.840 --> 56:24.171
Andrew Birch. One more.

56:28.520 --> 56:30.170
That's more like it.

56:45.920 --> 56:48.924
There and there,
and another one there.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.361
Carlos, you write at the bottom.

57:05.480 --> 57:06.720
Good lad.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.847
Welcome to the family, Andrew.

57:22.500 --> 57:30.500
