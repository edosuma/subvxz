WEBVTT

00:15.283 --> 00:18.186
(whistling)

00:18.219 --> 00:20.554
Hey! You have
any change?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.256
Oh, sorry.
I only have 20s.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.792
I got them from working.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.694
(whistling)

00:26.727 --> 00:29.097
REBECCA:
How cute were we at summer camp?

00:29.130 --> 00:31.532
Look, oh, there's us in the
Camp Canyon Grove lunch line.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.401
Oh.
So cute!

00:33.434 --> 00:35.169
There's you
lifting weights.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.537
Supes cute.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.772
There's you flexing.
Cute, cute, cute.
Oh.

00:38.806 --> 00:42.343
Oh, this is you in
the camp chapel.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.546
Remember? You were the
only one who went in there.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.814
Yeah, I know it's not cool

00:46.847 --> 00:48.816
to believe in God
and stuff, but I do.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.219
Oh, my God. That's,
like... that's insane.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.154
I believe in God, too.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.188
What are the odds?

00:54.222 --> 00:56.557
I think a lot of people
believe in...

00:56.590 --> 00:58.159
MAN:
Hey, man.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.428
JOSH:
What's wrong?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.530
Sorry, it's...
Greg's over there,

01:02.563 --> 01:06.500
and I haven't really seen
him since our... our date.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.768
You took some guy home

01:07.801 --> 01:09.337
from our date

01:09.370 --> 01:11.705
and slept with him?
What is wrong with you?!

01:11.739 --> 01:13.341
(sighs)

01:13.374 --> 01:14.508
Hi!

01:14.542 --> 01:15.743
(laughing)

01:15.776 --> 01:18.279
How are you?
I'm good.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.281
I'd ask how you are,
but I already know.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.415
You're terrible.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.251
W-What?

01:23.284 --> 01:24.652
She's horrible.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.820
What are you talking about?
What did she do?

01:26.854 --> 01:29.390
(laughing)
What didn't she do?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.791
Um, Greg, what
are you doing?

01:30.824 --> 01:33.161
Don't say anything.
What are...? What?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.263
It's nothing.
Uh, uh, oh, oh, no, don't worry.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.399
I won't tell him anything.
Why? Because I'm not terrible.

01:38.432 --> 01:42.603
O-Okay, maybe you had a bad
date, but Rebecca is awesome.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.604
She just moved here

01:43.637 --> 01:44.905
and already she's done

01:44.938 --> 01:46.307
so much for everybody.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.475
No, I can't argue with that.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.611
She has done so, so much.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.547
What's this? Oh,
no, no, no, no.
It's nothing!
It's nothing!

01:53.581 --> 01:56.317
Pictures from your little summer
camp fling, which you lied to me

01:56.350 --> 01:57.318
and everyone else about.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.587
Dude, you're being
a little harsh to Rebecca.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.821
Okay?
Are you gonna defend her?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.423
You're just as bad, Chan.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.791
Look at you.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.359
Cuddling up over boba
when you know

02:05.393 --> 02:06.894
your girlfriend
would not be cool with that.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.362
There's a word for that.
What is it?

02:08.395 --> 02:09.697
Oh, yeah. Terrible.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.365
MAN:
Number 31!

02:11.399 --> 02:12.566
That's me.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.835
Bye, liars
and terrible people.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.572
That was ridiculous.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.807
He is ridiculous.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.910
Who just marches up to people
and tells them they're terrible?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.645
I know, right?
That's insane!

02:24.678 --> 02:25.946
No one has ever said anything

02:25.979 --> 02:27.848
like that to me
before in my life!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.717
Yeah, me neither.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.187
NAOMI:
You're selfish
and dramatic and weird.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.922
You drove your father
out of this house.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.390
You're terrible!

02:36.424 --> 02:38.792
Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's a...

02:38.826 --> 02:40.694
that's a bad thing
to say to somebody.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.463
That would scar you.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.399
There is nothing
wrong with us.
Especially not you.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.736
You're great!
You're awesome.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.350
I should go.
Well, I should
probably go.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.718
Oh, yeah, let's go.
Yeah, here you go. Yeah.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.488
Okay. Okay, yup.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.589
I don't care what he says.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.824
I am a good person.
I'm a great person.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.560
I do good things
all the time, like...

03:12.593 --> 03:16.297
Hi. Here.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.698
Yes.
(inhale deeply through her nose)

03:17.731 --> 03:21.435
And is there anything else
that I can do for you today?

03:21.469 --> 03:23.871
REBECCA:
 So I did something

03:23.904 --> 03:25.539
that wasn't great.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.508
I mean, yeah, I'm
not proud of it,

03:27.541 --> 03:30.010
especially since I came to
this city for a new start.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.812
I guess I messed that up.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.882
But what I did wasn't, like,
Hitler level or anything.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.784
This is a really nice car.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.353
Oh, thanks! It's a
2015 Hyundai Sonata.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.655
It has 185 horsepower,
17-inch alloy wheels,

03:41.689 --> 03:42.990
a four-cylinder
engine, heated seats,

03:43.023 --> 03:45.626
and a hands-free
smart trunk.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.831
Greg is so wrong about me.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.867
I'll show him. You just watch.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.736
Yeah, you can
let me out here.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.338
What's your damage?

03:57.371 --> 03:59.340
(engine revving)

03:59.373 --> 04:02.276
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

04:02.310 --> 04:03.944
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
* One day I was crying a lot

04:05.713 --> 04:06.847
* And so I decided to move

04:06.880 --> 04:08.616
* To West Covina, California

04:08.649 --> 04:09.850
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

04:09.883 --> 04:12.052
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

04:12.085 --> 04:14.722
* But that's not why I'm here

04:14.755 --> 04:16.824
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.559
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

04:18.591 --> 04:19.560
That's a sexist term.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.060
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

04:21.094 --> 04:22.430
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.932
* She's so broken inside *

04:24.965 --> 04:26.534
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.536
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

04:28.569 --> 04:29.870
Okay! We get it!

04:29.903 --> 04:32.272
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

04:34.708 --> 04:37.578
(drumming rapidly on desk)

04:37.611 --> 04:40.714
Hey. (clears throat)

04:40.748 --> 04:42.550
(drumming rapidly
with his hands)

04:42.583 --> 04:44.685
Hey, would you mind...

04:44.718 --> 04:45.753
turning that down?

04:45.786 --> 04:46.987
Has to be loud.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.457
If I can't hear the
bass, my rhythm's off.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.924
(laughter)

04:50.958 --> 04:52.493
Hello?!

04:52.526 --> 04:55.062
Oh, hello. I'm
sorry, Pamela.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.530
Paula.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.333
Oh, well... I
apologized to Pamela,

04:59.367 --> 05:01.068
so I guess I'm not sorry.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.537
(laughter)

05:03.571 --> 05:05.406
Hey.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.940
Hey, Pam-spray,

05:06.974 --> 05:09.810
did you rewrite my brief
for the Caswick case?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.812
Yeah, three days ago.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.447
It's on your desk.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.817
Oh, then I spilled some coffee
on that bad boy.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.952
Can you hop on your
Pamster wheel and print me up

05:18.986 --> 05:20.120
another one?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.690
Nope. You're rude.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.425
And you're Pam.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.959
(laughing)

05:25.993 --> 05:28.562
Ooh!
(laughter)

05:28.596 --> 05:30.097
Oh, Karen,
did you file those briefs?

05:30.130 --> 05:33.100
No, I'm sorry, my snake is sick,
and I just can't focus

05:33.133 --> 05:34.435
whenever my
snake is sick.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.703
Also, my Internet is down,

05:35.736 --> 05:37.838
so I can't post about it
on my YouTube channel.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.840
So I was gonna tweet
about it instead,

05:39.873 --> 05:41.842
but then my account
got hacked again, so...

05:41.875 --> 05:45.112
Okay, Karen, Karen, you told me
all of this this morning,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.415
and you're my case assistant,
and I just...

05:47.448 --> 05:49.417
I really need you to focus.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.352
I need to go. My
electrolytes are low.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.956
(whispering):
These people are such garbage.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.991
(elevator bell dings)

05:58.025 --> 06:00.060
Okay, no big deal,

06:00.093 --> 06:02.896
but I got lattes
for the entire office.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.399
That's right,
more than three bucks!

06:05.433 --> 06:07.701
And everyone's name is written
correctly on the cup.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.471
Also, I brought donuts
for everybody.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.172
And I'm not talking
about the plain ones, no,

06:12.205 --> 06:13.941
they got all the goop on them.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.876
So come get it.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.045
Oh, Karen. I saw
that flyer last week.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.614
Are you still crowdfunding for
Long John Slither's fang cancer?

06:20.648 --> 06:22.149
Yeah, I just found out

06:22.182 --> 06:23.617
it's terminal.
Oh, my God.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.185
We're gonna fight this, okay?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.787
I pledge $1,000

06:26.820 --> 06:28.622
to help your
sick snake.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.923
Oh, thank...
thank you.
Yes.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.191
He's in so much pain.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.594
PAULA:
So...

06:33.627 --> 06:35.596
clearly, you're still on this

06:35.629 --> 06:36.564
"I'm a good person" thing.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.032
I mean, Greg really
got to me this morning.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.634
Oh, come on!

06:40.668 --> 06:43.070
You are not a terrible person.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.806
Greg is just
a whiny little bitch.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.507
Yeah.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.508
And sexy.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.442
He should be

06:48.476 --> 06:49.910
a-a search term on porn sites.

06:49.943 --> 06:50.611
Okay.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.945
But who cares what he thinks?

06:51.979 --> 06:53.481
Well, I care what he thinks,

06:53.514 --> 06:55.015
because I care what me thinks

06:55.048 --> 06:57.818
and me wants me
to be a good person.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.453
Am I a good person?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.522
Being a good person
is overrated.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.223
I mean, who cares about that?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.191
Darryl!

07:04.224 --> 07:05.759
Darryl, Darryl,
Darryl.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.627
Just the man I wanted to see.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.061
Are you still
selling chocolate bars

07:08.095 --> 07:09.196
for your daughter's
baseball team?

07:09.229 --> 07:10.731
Mm-hmm.
Okay, great.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.933
I'm gonna buy
all of the chocolate bars.

07:12.966 --> 07:13.967
All.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.035
All!

07:15.068 --> 07:15.869
Yeah.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.805
Now, you might be thinking,
"What?

07:17.838 --> 07:19.039
"Rebecca,
that's too nice.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.207
It's too good."

07:20.240 --> 07:22.042
Well, that's
who I am, people.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.210
My goodness

07:23.243 --> 07:25.546
in "on fleek,"
as the Internet says.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.048
Oh! But, Darryl, what's wrong?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.217
(sighs)
Shut the door.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.685
If anyone needs me,

07:31.719 --> 07:33.754
I'll be in here helping Darryl.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.188
We're all clear?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.223
Great.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.226
What's wrong, buddy?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.828
It's my stupid wife Stacey.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.229
She's trying to get
primary custody of my daughter.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.532
Jiminy Christmas.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.534
I'm the primary parent.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.669
I spend way more time
with Madison than she does.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.803
I mean...

07:49.837 --> 07:51.204
she's just
jealous.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.941
I mean, what if I lose Madison?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.009
Oh, I'm in my own private hell.

07:57.745 --> 08:01.248
Well, it doesn't have to be
private anymore, Darryl.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.282
Come on.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.917
Everybody...

08:03.951 --> 08:04.985
I have an announcement to make.

08:05.018 --> 08:05.986
Gather around,
it's very exciting.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.755
As we all know,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.623
our boss,
Darryl Whitefeather,

08:09.657 --> 08:11.825
has been going through
a very terrible divorce.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.193
Yeah, you know,
the "private" part

08:13.226 --> 08:15.128
wasn't the part
I wanted to change.
Okay. Yeah.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.665
So I have decided
to represent him

08:17.698 --> 08:19.600
in his divorce case.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.602
What?
You're gonna represent me?

08:21.635 --> 08:22.970
Oh, my gosh,
that's all I ever wanted!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.738
I mean, you said "no"
so many times...

08:24.772 --> 08:26.740
Bup-bup-bup, bup-bup-bup.
(chuckles)

08:26.774 --> 08:28.642
No, I mean, I asked yesterday
and you said, "No!"

08:28.676 --> 08:30.010
Bup-bup-bup-bup!
I was thinking about it.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.278
Okay. It's just that, you know,
you said "never..."

08:31.311 --> 08:32.946
So, Daddy, you ready
to get to work?

08:32.980 --> 08:34.313
Mm-hmm! You bet.
Come on.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.017
'Cause Darryl and I need
to focus so hard on the case,

08:37.049 --> 08:39.019
we will be out of the office
for the next few days.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.621
Um, where
are we going?

08:40.654 --> 08:41.621
It doesn't matter.
No.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.623
Okay?
No.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.756
Hey. Wait a minute.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.758
W-What about
the Caswick case?

08:44.792 --> 08:45.893
We need
your help.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.327
What are we
supposed to do?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.162
Maybe actually do your job.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.030
Hmm.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.031
You can't go.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.165
I need approvals.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.802
Well, Paula knows the office,
like, inside and out.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.737
She can handle it all.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.038
Paula's not a lawyer.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.139
She's a paralegal.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.242
You mean she can handle
the filing and the coffee.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.243
(Tim chuckles)

09:03.276 --> 09:04.978
No, Tim.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.179
I mean she can
supervise everything,

09:06.213 --> 09:07.948
including the cases.

09:07.981 --> 09:08.949
Yeah, Paula's in charge.

09:08.982 --> 09:09.950
Cool, Darryl?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.184
Yeah. Sure.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.086
Great. Knock 'em dead.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.859
(sighs)

09:39.279 --> 09:41.048
Ow.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.650
A shard got in my eye.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.651
I need some
eyewash!

09:43.684 --> 09:44.785
Karen!

09:44.818 --> 09:46.854
You passive-aggressive,

09:46.887 --> 09:49.222
miserable piece of garbage.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.859
Shut your garbage face!

09:53.226 --> 09:55.128
(giggles)

09:55.162 --> 09:56.296
You heard what they said.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.934
I'm in charge now.

10:00.968 --> 10:05.105
And we are going to get some
friggin' work done around here!

10:05.138 --> 10:07.307
Do you hear me?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.679
Now go.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.183
(indistinct chatter)

10:17.250 --> 10:19.252
(cheering)

10:22.890 --> 10:24.391
Um, why are we here?

10:24.424 --> 10:27.094
Uh, they have great coffee
and free Wi-Fi.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.862
Um, so does our office.

10:28.896 --> 10:29.797
Hi.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.331
Hi. Yeah.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.199
We'd like two
coffees over here.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.867
And you know what?
Just keep it coming,

10:33.901 --> 10:35.435
'cause I'm gonna be doing
a lot of helping.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.670
Thanks.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.071
I like your shirt.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.406
(sighs)

10:39.439 --> 10:41.975
So, Darryl, let's talk
about this arbitration,

10:42.009 --> 10:44.111
where I'll save
your daughter.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.178
DARRYL:
Save her?

10:45.212 --> 10:47.114
Is she in danger?
I mean, did something happen?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.716
No, no, Darryl,
that's why I'm here,

10:48.749 --> 10:50.984
is to protect you from your
evil wife's machinations.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.152
Okay, look, the truth
is, I just want

10:52.185 --> 10:53.086
whatever's best for Madison.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.822
I mean, I just want us all
to get along.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.690
Hey, chief, just a sec.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.793
Hey.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.895
Hey, can we
get some waters

11:01.929 --> 11:04.097
and a breakfast
burrito just for me?

11:04.131 --> 11:05.799
I'm sorry if we're
loud over there.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.300
I'm just helping out a friend;

11:07.334 --> 11:08.902
a little pro bones work
as I like to say.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.203
(whispers): It's Darryl
and his divorce.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.005
He has a kid, right?
Yeah, that's why I'm help...

11:12.039 --> 11:13.240
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.476
I don't know what you're up to,
but this is about a family.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.911
This isn't about you.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.012
No, I'm aware.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.348
I mean, as a child of divorce,
I understand that...

11:21.381 --> 11:23.383
Oh, spare me, please.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.287
Do you forgive me yet?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.390
JOSH:
 Forgive me, Father,
 for I have sinned.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.360
I haven't been to confession
in three years.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.328
PRIEST:
Hmm, my son.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.064
You must repent

11:37.097 --> 11:40.367
and do 5,000 Hail Marys.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.935
That's so many.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.805
And, uh, 400...

11:44.838 --> 11:45.939
keg stands, dude!

11:45.973 --> 11:47.040
It's me, bro!

11:47.074 --> 11:49.442
Father Brah, no way!

11:49.476 --> 11:50.944
Yeah, I got promoted.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.746
I can finally do confession now.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.147
That's amazing, Father Brah.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.282
Thanks, man,
I've been meaning to say

11:55.315 --> 11:57.217
thank you so much
for the nickname.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.451
Oh, yeah, glad you like it.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.387
It was super easy
to come up with.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.790
Father Joseph,
Father Bro-seph,

12:02.823 --> 12:04.357
Father Bro,
Father Brah-- bam! Psh!

12:04.391 --> 12:07.227
I mean, attendance has
shot through the roof

12:07.260 --> 12:08.461
since you did that, man.
Nice!

12:08.495 --> 12:10.998
Now, what's up, man?
What can I do for you?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.966
So, I've been
with Valencia for, like,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.968
forever and I know
we're meant to be together.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.503
But someone recently
said something to me.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.971
I don't want to say who.

12:18.005 --> 12:18.972
Greg.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.774
It was Greg, mm-hmm.
He said something to me

12:20.808 --> 12:23.376
that on one level
I didn't think was true.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.312
But on another level it is true.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.181
So there are, like, two things
going in in my brain right now.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.950
Two things are a lot
for one brain.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.885
Okay, so let's simplify.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.888
What's really bothering you?

12:36.023 --> 12:38.758
Just tell me straight up
from your heart, dude.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.264
I think I might be attracted
to someone besides Valencia.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.169
Don't get me wrong.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.303
I still love Valencia.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.905
But there is another girl.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.473
Yeah, I hear you, J-town,
I mean,

12:53.506 --> 12:56.309
look, let--
tell you what.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.079
Let's take this
to a higher court.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.584
So, you're saying that one day,
you want to marry Valencia,

13:04.617 --> 13:06.386
have kidlings and, like,

13:06.419 --> 13:07.921
live happily ever after.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.389
Right, so then,
when I find myself

13:09.422 --> 13:11.091
thinking
about this other girl...

13:11.124 --> 13:12.993
That's a foul, dude.
I know, I feel terrible!

13:13.026 --> 13:14.594
No, I mean, like,
like, watch your elbows.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.297
Oh. So, I think
about Rebecca's smile,

13:17.330 --> 13:20.300
you know, her hair,
her boobs, her butt,

13:20.333 --> 13:22.202
her... boobs.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.971
Well, it's natural to have
those feelings, dawg.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.538
(both grunt)

13:25.572 --> 13:29.910
But it's not just that
Rebecca makes me feel great.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.947
You know, she believes in me
in a way that nobody else does.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.483
Well, that's... major.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.185
And that's not all.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.453
I do other things
that are sinful.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.290
I've had premarital sex.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.192
Lots of it.
And sometimes I watch

13:45.225 --> 13:48.095
adult content
and I take care of myself.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.964
And I don't mean in the
vitamin/exercising kind of way.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.132
Okay, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.433
Look, dude.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.502
The way I see it-- you're lucky.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.371
No, man, this moral
crisis you're having?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.639
It's a chance to look within.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.510
Like, God is personally inviting
you to take stock of your life.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.113
So, here's an
assignment, okay?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.148
For, like, the next 24 hours,

14:08.181 --> 14:10.150
what I want you to do is
write down all the thoughts

14:10.183 --> 14:11.885
that you think are sinful.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.653
Okay.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.923
God is challenging you, man.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.491
It's an opportunity.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.428
Just like this is
an opportunity.
Oh, come on.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.130
Oh, nothing but net!

14:23.163 --> 14:25.532
And Christ!

14:25.565 --> 14:29.402
* Oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh... *

14:29.436 --> 14:33.306
DARRYL:
 Oh, Madison, she was
 such a fussy baby.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.474
I mean, she would
cry all night long.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.177
I mean, these ear-piercing
screams, but you know what?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.378
Are you listening to me?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.679
Yeah, sorry, I-I am.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.648
Anyway, she had
this first grade teacher,

14:41.681 --> 14:43.550
who was an amazing
listener...
Hey! Hey!

14:43.583 --> 14:45.352
Uh... do you know
where Greg went?

14:45.385 --> 14:46.419
He went home.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.120
Wait, how'd I miss him?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.156
He went through the back door?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.290
Wait.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.691
I know you-- you're that lady

14:51.724 --> 14:53.160
on the dartboard
in the storage room.

14:53.193 --> 14:53.994
Oh.

14:54.027 --> 14:54.995
(laughing)

14:55.028 --> 14:56.363
That's how we kid.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.597
Me and Greg, yeah.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.166
We make a joke
about the other person

14:59.199 --> 15:01.201
in another room that
the other person will never see,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.536
and then we never tell
the other person about it.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.272
It's so funny.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.439
Oh, give him my regards.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.975
Nice meeting you.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.542
Uh-huh.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.179
Okay.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.981
You know, I'm--

15:14.014 --> 15:16.049
I think I got to call it a day.
Oh...

15:16.083 --> 15:17.617
I got to go home
and think about this case.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.452
I just don't know
if there's enough evidence here

15:19.486 --> 15:21.121
to redo the custody
arrangements.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.455
Oh, but you have to come up
with something.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.623
Wait!

15:23.656 --> 15:25.458
Rebecca, look.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.728
I need you to understand
this is not just another case.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.730
And this is not just a favor
you're doing for your boss.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.399
This means everything to me.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.367
Madison is my sun and my moon.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.437
She is the candle in the window
that guides me home.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.172
She's the cream in my coffee!

15:39.206 --> 15:40.707
Okay, dude, I got
to stop you, sorry.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.110
Uh, maybe it's because my
father's an abandoning coward.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.711
Could be that,
but I feel like

15:44.744 --> 15:46.313
you should dial back

15:46.346 --> 15:49.482
the whole daddy-daughter
love thing.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.352
It sounds a little like...
AMBER Alert.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.354
What?!
What are you talking about?

15:54.387 --> 15:56.123
A father's love for a daughter

15:56.156 --> 15:57.624
is one of the purest loves
on Earth!

15:57.657 --> 15:59.226
Oh, no.

15:59.259 --> 16:03.230
I just wish I could explain
how I feel about her.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.498
I'm gonna try.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.534
(country music playing)

16:12.605 --> 16:15.375
* Daddy's little girl

16:15.408 --> 16:17.777
* Princess of my world

16:17.810 --> 16:21.381
* I never knew a beauty
like this before *

16:21.414 --> 16:24.384
* So clever and cute

16:24.417 --> 16:26.653
* An angel with an attitude

16:26.686 --> 16:29.656
* I want her all mine
all of the time *

16:29.689 --> 16:34.561
* I know songs like this
can come off weird *

16:36.496 --> 16:38.198
* But there's nothing weird

16:38.231 --> 16:42.369
* About helping Daddy
trim his beard *

16:43.803 --> 16:45.405
* Dads do that

16:45.438 --> 16:48.275
* 'Cause I love my daughter

16:48.308 --> 16:50.743
* But not in a creepy way

16:50.777 --> 16:54.647
* No, I realize father-daughter
love comes off that way *

16:54.681 --> 16:57.084
* I just love my daughter

16:57.117 --> 17:00.220
* But again,
not in a creepy way *

17:00.253 --> 17:04.824
* The father-daughter dates
surrounded by adorable girls *

17:04.857 --> 17:08.261
* But there's only one
that's got my eye *

17:08.295 --> 17:10.696
* Her feet on my shoes

17:10.730 --> 17:12.299
* Her hands on my hips

17:12.332 --> 17:15.768
* Yeah, it's a weird visual
now that I think of it *

17:15.801 --> 17:20.473
* I know lines like that
can skeeve people out *

17:22.608 --> 17:25.311
* But when it comes
to tickling *

17:25.345 --> 17:26.779
(whoops)

17:26.813 --> 17:28.848
* She about to get it now

17:28.881 --> 17:32.252
* I'm very careful
where I tickle my daughter *

17:32.285 --> 17:34.587
* Never inappropriately

17:34.621 --> 17:36.689
* I can see how that came out

17:36.723 --> 17:38.791
* A bit confusingly

17:38.825 --> 17:40.727
* I just love my daughter

17:40.760 --> 17:44.164
* But seriously,
not in a creepy way *

17:44.197 --> 17:46.333
* One day she'll fall in love

17:46.366 --> 17:47.867
* And I'll give her away

17:47.900 --> 17:50.237
* Not like I ever had her

17:50.270 --> 17:52.439
* What a weird thing to say

17:52.472 --> 17:54.441
* I can see it now

17:54.474 --> 17:56.376
* She'll look
just like her mom *

17:56.409 --> 17:58.511
* Granted, I did have sex
with her mom *

17:58.545 --> 18:02.515
* Oh, but this is different,
'cause I love my daughter *

18:02.549 --> 18:05.285
* But not in a love-love way

18:05.318 --> 18:07.687
* Did you get what I...
(groans)

18:07.720 --> 18:09.489
* What I mean to say is

18:09.522 --> 18:11.258
* I'll just stop talking

18:11.291 --> 18:13.493
* Having a daughter

18:13.526 --> 18:17.630
* Is weird.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.632
You know what?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.401
That was actually
kind of moving.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.769
Really?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.504
Yes.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.373
And it gave me a brilliant idea.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.142
Is Madison home from school yet?

18:29.176 --> 18:30.510
Don't look so sad.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.612
You will get your pho--
thank you.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.614
You'll get them back
at the end of the workday,

18:34.647 --> 18:36.616
which may be midnight.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.418
I got to go-- some
bitch wants my phone.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.387
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna strangle you.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.621
Put it in. Put it in.
Put it in the box!

18:41.654 --> 18:42.689
Thank you.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.162
This is my gumball machine!

18:49.196 --> 18:50.763
It is not
your gumball machine!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
It is everybody's
gumball machine.
No!

18:52.832 --> 18:56.336
You are not Don Draper!

19:00.673 --> 19:03.310
Darryl is so
damn disorganized.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.713
Some of the papers
in here are so old.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.448
Oh, good news.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.583
I found a coupon
from Blockbuster.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.719
The Color Purple is now
available on LaserDisc.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.694
Okay, that's strange.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.230
Paula, Paula?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.831
I have a weird tampon thing
happening.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.600
Bup, bup, bup!
Karen, shut it down.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.722
Oh, Tim.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.592
Oh.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.594
Hi, Paula.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.596
So now you know my name.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.365
Interesting.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.832
Listen, I'm sorry about...

19:59.866 --> 20:02.469
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
Did you say "about"

20:02.502 --> 20:05.905
or "a-boot"?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.874
That's right, Timster.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.609
I know the truth.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.378
Please, you can't tell anyone.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.679
Don't tell anyone what?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.647
That you're not
an American citizen?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.883
That you've been working
in this country illegally

20:16.916 --> 20:20.320
on an expired visa,
because you're really Canadian?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.788
Paula, please, I need this job.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.457
I alienated everyone
in my firm in Winnipeg.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.393
Shocking.
I came out to L.A.
for a convention.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.494
I met Darryl at a strip club.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.661
We had a night
that we swore

20:28.695 --> 20:29.796
we would never speak of again.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.365
I gave him some fake documents
and he never noticed!

20:32.399 --> 20:33.633
Yeah, you know what?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.635
I saw through that phony
work permit right away.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.304
I've been at the firm
ever since,

20:37.337 --> 20:38.471
watching my long Os

20:38.505 --> 20:39.806
and pretending
not to like hockey.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.374
It's been so difficult.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.776
Yeah, no, it sounds harrowing.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.513
Look, I know you hate me.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.348
And now you got a reason
to get rid of me.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.949
But I am begging you.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.751
Paula, what are you gonna do?

20:51.784 --> 20:53.586
I don't know.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.655
Because I'm gonna have
to talk to Pamela,

20:55.688 --> 20:58.625
and she is a real bitch.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.534
This one is Snail-y Minaj.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.570
This one is Snail-or Swift.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.572
And this one is
Snail-y Rae Jepsen.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.840
(chuckles)

21:13.873 --> 21:15.442
Maybe you should
name one Escargot.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.811
I'm sorry.

21:18.845 --> 21:19.679
That was...
it was a...

21:19.712 --> 21:21.414
(chuckling): it was
a joke, get it?

21:21.448 --> 21:24.083
You're here to talk
about my parents, right?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.586
Rebecca, you know what,
I'm-I'm not too sure about this.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.720
Look, honey, I just don't
want to put you

21:27.754 --> 21:28.721
in the middle
of this whole thing...

21:28.755 --> 21:29.689
You know, Madison,

21:29.722 --> 21:33.092
I think we can tell the
judge what you want.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.994
Oh, that's easy--
I want to live with my dad.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.332
"I want to live
with Madison's dad.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.368
He's the best."

21:41.401 --> 21:42.635
Well, thank you,
Iggy A-snail-ya.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.871
I appreciate that.

21:44.904 --> 21:48.341
So, Madison, I'm here
to help you get what you want.

21:48.375 --> 21:52.011
So if there's anything
you could think of

21:52.044 --> 21:54.013
that would help me
win this case...

21:54.046 --> 21:56.115
Well, let me see.
Yeah, uh-huh.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.717
You know what,
this is a mistake.
It's fine. No, shh.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.719
MADISON:
(gasps) Oh.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.721
Well, sometimes my mom
leaves me home by myself,

22:01.754 --> 22:03.790
and I went on her iPad
to see where she was,

22:03.823 --> 22:07.326
and turns out she goes
to a motel with her boss.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.902
That's something, right?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.909
Oh, come on, Tim's a dick.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.412
We can finally
get rid of him,

22:25.445 --> 22:26.946
send him back to the land

22:26.979 --> 22:28.681
of universal health
care and nice people.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.116
I know.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.585
He's got kids,
and they're cute.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.587
They're probably
jerks, too.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.923
Like, little Justin
Bieber jerks.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.090
You know it's true.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.092
Wow, this place is
so quiet and tidy.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.694
What'd you do?

22:41.728 --> 22:43.530
She broke our spirit.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.031
Great.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.101
PAULA: Okay, you're
not gonna believe

22:49.135 --> 22:50.302
what has been
happening around here.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.573
First of all, Karen has been
hoarding all the calcium chews.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.107
Okay, Paula, I really want
to hear about all this,

22:55.141 --> 22:56.175
but I actually got to
get to the courthouse.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.511
I scheduled an emergency
hearing for Darryl today.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.512
A hearing already?

22:59.546 --> 23:00.447
Yeah.
Wow.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.682
Yeah, I'm gonna
bust this case wide open.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.418
And when I do-- suck it, Greg.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.420
(grunts rhythmically)

23:08.688 --> 23:10.657
* Greg's gonna suck it,
Greg's gonna suck it *

23:10.690 --> 23:12.058
* Greg's gonna suck it--
ah, yeah! *

23:12.091 --> 23:14.794
Your Honor, what is
the emergency?

23:14.827 --> 23:15.828
I have a business
trip to the Caymans.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.764
My plane is
leaving today.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.800
Your Honor, may we begin?

23:20.833 --> 23:23.536
What's up, YouTubers?

23:23.570 --> 23:26.105
It's episode three
of The Snailysitters Club.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.607
She has a YouTube channel?

23:27.640 --> 23:28.608
I know, right?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.142
Everybody has a YouTube channel.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.211
Even weird Karen from my office.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.681
So tonight,
just like last Friday,

23:34.714 --> 23:37.550
my mom is with her boss
at the motel,

23:37.584 --> 23:39.819
and I'm with the best
babysitters in the world--

23:39.852 --> 23:42.188
my snails, holla!

23:42.221 --> 23:45.191
This week is super exciting

23:45.224 --> 23:48.661
'cause me and my snails
are gonna make s'mores

23:48.695 --> 23:51.698
on the gas stove.
(chuckles)

23:51.731 --> 23:52.965
Left alone.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.967
Gas stove.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.969
Some mores.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.971
Your Honor, she is very mature.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.708
And I was only gone
for a couple minutes.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.042
Half hour at the most.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.811
How long were you
sleeping with him? Hmm?

24:04.844 --> 24:07.079
You worked there
for five years.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.216
The whole five years?

24:10.249 --> 24:13.686
Yeah, but he doesn't talk
about his feelings all the time.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.855
And he doesn't cry
at cat food commercials.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.491
Your Honor, the evidence
of neglect is irrefutable.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.992
Ms. Bunch,
I have to agree with you.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.227
Mr. Whitefeather,

24:21.260 --> 24:22.595
I'm granting you

24:22.629 --> 24:23.863
temporary full custody
of your daughter.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.698
(whispering):
Yes.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.100
Mrs. Whitefeather, you will
have supervised visitation

24:28.134 --> 24:30.269
until the custody arrangements
are fully finalized.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.272
Supervi...

24:33.305 --> 24:34.941
Great.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.208
Thank you so much

24:36.242 --> 24:38.210
for your attention
in this matter, Your Honor.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.912
Justice has indeed

24:39.946 --> 24:40.947
been served.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.615
You are a good person.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.884
He is a good person.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.020
We are good person.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.523
*

24:58.698 --> 25:01.934
* I'm a good person,
yes, it's true *

25:01.968 --> 25:05.004
* I'm a good person--
better than you *

25:05.037 --> 25:07.840
* I'm a good person,
can't you see? *

25:07.874 --> 25:10.977
* Doctors Without Borders
don't have nothing on me *

25:11.010 --> 25:13.980
* I'm a good person,
and if you ask why *

25:14.013 --> 25:16.983
* I'll spit my good
right into your eye *

25:17.016 --> 25:19.752
* Everywhere I go,
I spread such bliss *

25:19.786 --> 25:21.754
* And if you don't think so

25:21.788 --> 25:25.157
* You can kiss... my ass...
which is made of good *

25:25.191 --> 25:27.059
(feedback sounds)

25:27.093 --> 25:28.327
Hey, that mic
cost $300!

25:28.360 --> 25:31.998
* Didn't you know
that I'm a good person? *

25:32.031 --> 25:34.000
* I'm pure angel
through and through *

25:34.033 --> 25:37.269
* Doesn't it show
that I'm a good person? *

25:37.303 --> 25:40.172
* So much gooder
than you and you *

25:40.206 --> 25:42.008
* And you and you and you

25:42.041 --> 25:44.744
* I'm a good person,
that's my thing *

25:44.777 --> 25:47.647
* My nickname is
Mother Teresa Luther King *

25:47.680 --> 25:50.817
* I'm a good person--
get it straight *

25:50.850 --> 25:54.086
* And when I say good,
I really mean great, the best *

25:54.120 --> 25:55.955
* #HumbleAndBlessed

25:55.988 --> 25:57.223
* News flash, douche bags

25:57.256 --> 25:58.958
* I'm a good person

25:58.991 --> 26:01.961
* Do what I can for you
all the time *

26:01.994 --> 26:05.031
* That's how I am,
'cause I'm a good person *

26:05.064 --> 26:07.033
* I always find time
to be kind *

26:07.066 --> 26:08.768
(choking):
Choking.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.770
Sorry, so busy.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.973
* I'm a good, such a good,
real good person *

26:14.006 --> 26:16.108
* I'm a good person
through and through *

26:16.142 --> 26:19.145
* I'm a good, such a good,
real good person *

26:19.178 --> 26:21.614
* Let me hear you say it, too

26:21.648 --> 26:22.448
Say it.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.651
Say it or I'll kill
your husband.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.118
I'll do it, I'll gut him
like a fish.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.287
(angrily): You're
a good person.
Aw, thank you.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.758
* I'm a good, such a good,
real good person *

26:31.791 --> 26:34.861
* I'm a good person,
yes, it's true *

26:34.894 --> 26:37.730
* I'm a good, such a good,
real good person *

26:37.764 --> 26:39.766
* I'm a good person, get it?

26:39.799 --> 26:41.668
* Screw you.

26:41.701 --> 26:42.902
(sighs)

26:42.935 --> 26:43.936
Let's celebrate.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.774
Darryl?
Mm-hmm?

26:47.807 --> 26:49.308
What's wrong?
We got what we wanted.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.376
Oh, look at Madison.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.745
She's so happy.
DARRYL: I know.
It's great.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.281
I just... My whole
life was a lie,

26:55.314 --> 26:56.749
but (chuckles) I'll
get used to that.

26:56.783 --> 26:57.750
Yeah, you will!

26:57.784 --> 26:59.051
Yeah!
That's the spirit.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.888
Barkeep.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.123
Your finest champagne.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.859
And, ooh, let's see, a mint
chocolate chip ice cream

27:06.893 --> 27:08.160
for the young lady.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.429
Sorry, (chuckles)
context--

27:10.462 --> 27:13.833
may I present to you
a family reunited.

27:13.866 --> 27:14.801
What do you suggest?

27:15.935 --> 27:18.304
I got Darryl temporary custody.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.806
Okay.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.073
So?

27:21.107 --> 27:25.177
Well, "so"-- (chuckles) you said
that I was a terrible person.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.347
But clearly now I'm not.

27:28.380 --> 27:32.251
You're... never mind.

27:32.284 --> 27:35.254
What do you mean,
"never mind"?

27:35.287 --> 27:38.324
What do you mean,
"never mind"?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.726
REBECCA:
Son of a...

27:39.759 --> 27:40.793
Hey!

27:40.827 --> 27:43.062
My God, I don't
understand you.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.997
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.266
Oh, just listen to me-- I'm out
there trying to help somebody,

27:47.299 --> 27:48.735
and all I ask is for
your forgiveness,

27:48.768 --> 27:49.736
and you won't even
give it to me.

27:49.769 --> 27:50.937
Why?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.240
Wow.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.743
Either you truly hate me
or you're super good at darts.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.044
Why do you care what I think?

27:58.077 --> 27:59.311
I'm not your priest.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.313
I just care, okay?

28:01.347 --> 28:03.816
Look, I know...
I know that I messed up.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.352
And I know that
it was, like, so wrong

28:06.385 --> 28:08.087
to sleep with another guy
on our date.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.822
I made a mistake.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.825
And so please just forgive me,
because I'm imperfect.

28:12.859 --> 28:13.993
Why is that so hard?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.261
Rebecca, let me be clear here.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.729
Unless you can un-have-sex

28:16.763 --> 28:18.264
with that guy you ditched me for
on our date,

28:18.297 --> 28:19.732
I don't care what you do.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.367
You could save the world,
Avengers-style.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.835
So this is about sex.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.103
Why didn't you say so?

28:24.136 --> 28:26.105
That's an easy thing to rectify.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.274
Let's do it, let's do it.
It's safe-- I'm on the ring.
What are you...? No.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.876
Yeah, let's get these
puppies out of the cage.
Stop it, stop it.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.378
Let these puppies out of
their crate.
Stop it, what
is... what is wrong with you?

28:32.411 --> 28:34.113
I-I'm supposed
to forget what happened

28:34.146 --> 28:37.283
because you took a case and got
some guy temporary custody?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.253
"Temporary."

28:41.287 --> 28:42.254
I get it.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.255
What?

28:43.289 --> 28:44.523
I get it, I get it.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.958
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.960
I don't get it.

28:47.994 --> 28:48.961
What?

28:48.995 --> 28:51.130
Okay, so new plan.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.866
I'm not gonna get you
temporary custody.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.402
Instead, how would you like it

28:56.435 --> 28:59.138
if I got you permanent custody?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.139
What?
Wait.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.540
Yep, that's
right. Mmm.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.776
(slurred): I'm gonna get you
permanent custody.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.044
I'm gonna do it right now.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.312
(speaks indistinctly)

29:06.345 --> 29:08.514
I missed that part.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.516
Sorry, that was cryptic,
let me explain.

29:10.549 --> 29:13.419
I'm gonna go to the bank,
withdraw $10,000,

29:13.452 --> 29:15.421
and plant it
in your wife's suitcase,

29:15.454 --> 29:16.889
because it's illegal to take

29:16.923 --> 29:18.157
that amount of money
over the border.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.425
So when she tries to fly
to the Cayman Islands,

29:19.458 --> 29:20.226
they'll find it and arrest her,

29:20.259 --> 29:21.427
and you'll get
permanent custody.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.895
That's all cleared up.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.230
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bank. Bye!

29:24.263 --> 29:26.265
Oh, she's bananas.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.140
*

30:02.634 --> 30:04.203
What the hell are you doing?!

30:09.408 --> 30:10.542
What up?

30:10.576 --> 30:12.278
'Sup?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.345
You got a game?
Yeah.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.547
Interfaith league,
playing The Chosen Ones today.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.616
Cantor Goldstein's
got this killer move.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.218
He calls it the Torah,
'cause you can't touch it.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.954
Uh, here-here's
my list of sins.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.322
Uh, I printed it out.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.324
You did it, man--
good on you.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.159
All right.

30:27.193 --> 30:30.429
Okay, so you went to the mall
and you saw a sexy mannequin

30:30.462 --> 30:32.865
and you wanted
to have sex with it.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.334
And then you saw
another sexy mannequin

30:35.367 --> 30:37.937
and you wanted to have sex
with that one, too.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.472
And then you saw
a sexy girl at the mall

30:40.506 --> 30:44.210
and you wanted her
to watch you have sex

30:44.243 --> 30:46.178
with two sexy mannequins.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.883
According to this list,
you thought about Rebecca a lot.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.885
Like, a lot a lot.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.420
And all day yesterday,

30:54.453 --> 30:57.156
did you act on any
of these sinful thoughts?

30:57.189 --> 30:59.058
No.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.360
Bro-heem, you're good.

31:01.393 --> 31:05.131
What matters is what you do,
not what you think.

31:05.164 --> 31:08.667
What God cares about
are our actions.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.270
That's all.

31:11.303 --> 31:15.007
So you admire Rebecca
for her brains and her beauty.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.375
I understand that.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.978
What's important is--

31:19.011 --> 31:21.280
what are you gonna do
about these feelings?

31:27.653 --> 31:28.454
What happened?

31:28.487 --> 31:29.621
Is there something
wrong with Madison?

31:29.655 --> 31:30.622
Is that why you're here?

31:30.656 --> 31:32.624
No.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.626
You know what? I'm
here for justice.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.529
Okay.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.498
I don't know what that means,
but please stop.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.033
You've taken my daughter away.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.134
Isn't that enough?

31:42.168 --> 31:44.070
I haven't taken
your daughter away.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.437
You abandoned
your daughter.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.406
You left her in a house
with nothing but snails?

31:47.439 --> 31:49.575
I mean, who
does that?
Bup-bup-bup!

31:49.608 --> 31:50.943
You have some nerve.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.611
So I made some
bad mistakes,

31:52.644 --> 31:54.480
but I do want
what's best for my daughter.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.682
I mean,
I love her so much.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.350
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

31:58.384 --> 32:00.352
to know that your child
prefers their father?

32:00.386 --> 32:02.188
Well, no, I don't have kids,
personally.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.722
Shocking.
But...

32:03.755 --> 32:06.025
I mean, it-it sounds hard.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.093
It all sounds hard.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.095
What would you know about
what I've been through?

32:09.128 --> 32:11.097
You're just
some soulless lawyer.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.332
Oh, yeah, I saw you
pump your fist

32:13.365 --> 32:14.967
when the judge
gave my daughter away.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.103
How dare you?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.471
Why in the world would you even
take on this case?

32:19.505 --> 32:21.507
What's wrong with you?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.675
I...

32:23.709 --> 32:26.478
What is wrong with me?

32:26.512 --> 32:29.148
Off the top of my head,
I'd say low self-esteem,

32:29.181 --> 32:30.349
a lack of maternal affection

32:30.382 --> 32:32.651
and a genetic predisposition
for anxiety and depression.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.120
(sighs)

32:34.153 --> 32:36.588
I did not think that was
where you were gonna go.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.525
God...

32:39.558 --> 32:41.593
Because of that lack

32:41.627 --> 32:43.595
of any parental validation,

32:43.629 --> 32:48.067
I always seek outside validation
from others.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.636
And somehow I've made Greg

32:50.669 --> 32:53.572
my new moral arbiter
in this town.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.242
Okay.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.676
You know what?

32:57.709 --> 32:59.311
I can fix this.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.312
We can fix this.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.214
Come with me.
Come with me.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.250
Who the hell is Greg?

33:10.689 --> 33:12.058
Do you know what?

33:12.091 --> 33:14.426
You have the softest hair.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.594
What do you want me to say,
people?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.163
That she doesn't have
the softest hair?

33:17.196 --> 33:18.764
And I don't watch her at night
when she's sleeping?

33:18.797 --> 33:20.032
'Cause I do.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.567
She's a little angel.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.668
Right?

33:22.701 --> 33:24.436
That's my girl.
(Madison giggles)

33:24.470 --> 33:26.438
Mommy!
You came to my game!

33:26.472 --> 33:28.574
I decided to postpone my trip.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.277
Oh.
You're with
the crazy lady.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.279
Hey...
REBECCA:
Well, okay.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.380
Crazy is a pejorative term

33:34.413 --> 33:35.581
and it's an over-generalization

33:35.614 --> 33:37.183
of a number of disorders...
What?

33:37.216 --> 33:39.551
That was so funny,
when you pretended

33:39.585 --> 33:42.421
like you were gonna put money
in my mom's suitcase.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.555
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.590
Okay. So, Darryl...

33:44.623 --> 33:45.457
Hmm?
Stacey and I

33:45.491 --> 33:48.327
had a talk and we agree

33:48.360 --> 33:50.162
that we can settle this custody
arrangement together.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.363
STACEY:
Yeah.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.532
We don't want to damage Madison
with our disagreements.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.367
That can lead to
a whole lot of problems.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.668
Ask Rebecca.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.137
Yeah. But don't ask me.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.271
Seriously, don't.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.406
You don't want
the whole spiel.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.673
So, yes,

34:01.707 --> 34:02.741
I believe that
we can come up with

34:02.774 --> 34:04.576
a fair and equitable arrangement

34:04.610 --> 34:06.312
without involving a judge.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.080
Does that sound good?

34:08.114 --> 34:10.149
Sounds great.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.417
Great.

34:11.449 --> 34:14.520
Stacey, thank you so
much for understanding.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.356
Can I have my cash back now?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.757
(whispering):
I already bought a hot tub.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.426
No...

34:20.458 --> 34:22.561
Now, uh, let's go
watch your game, guys.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.096
Yeah!
Sure.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.264
There we go.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.166
(giggles)
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.667
There you go.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.702
She had flyaways.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.304
Can't have her walking
around like that.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.806
REBECCA:
 I guess I just realized

34:35.841 --> 34:38.143
family is important.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.511
I was letting
my own self-interest

34:39.545 --> 34:41.513
get in the way of that.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.782
So Stacey and I worked out
what's best for Madison,

34:43.815 --> 34:46.217
and, you know,
at the end of the day,

34:46.252 --> 34:48.320
I just feel
really good about it.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.522
Yeah, you're a good
little munchkin.

34:50.556 --> 34:51.690
Thanks.

34:51.723 --> 34:54.326
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

35:02.734 --> 35:03.735
Tim!

35:05.404 --> 35:07.406
Get in here!

35:14.180 --> 35:15.247
I've made a decision.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.549
(sighs)

35:17.583 --> 35:19.818
Just... give me a couple hours

35:19.851 --> 35:21.553
to tell my family, okay?

35:21.587 --> 35:24.556
You know, I want to turn you in
so much,

35:24.590 --> 35:26.325
because you are

35:26.358 --> 35:28.627
an actual piece of garbage.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.196
But here's the thing:

35:30.229 --> 35:31.830
your family looks sweet,

35:31.863 --> 35:34.300
and I have no problem
ruining your life,

35:34.333 --> 35:35.867
but their lives...

35:35.901 --> 35:38.570
Oh, my God, Paula, are...

35:38.604 --> 35:40.939
are you not gonna turn me in
to the Federales?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.408
Don't pretend
you have the plight

35:42.441 --> 35:45.177
of an actual immigrant,
dickweed.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.478
I'm sorry.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.814
I'll change, I promise.

35:48.847 --> 35:49.881
Yeah, I doubt it.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.517
That's like asking Karen

35:51.550 --> 35:53.252
to not talk about tampons.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.753
Actually,
I just switched

35:54.786 --> 35:55.921
to those new
menstrual cups,

35:55.954 --> 35:57.889
which I can't
figure out.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.391
Who wants to help me?

36:03.795 --> 36:05.564
I hate her.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.568
*

36:13.239 --> 36:14.240
What?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.610
I think his kids are cute, okay?

36:18.644 --> 36:20.212
They remind me of my kids
in good times,

36:20.246 --> 36:21.480
when they were young...

36:21.513 --> 36:22.814
you know, before they could talk

36:22.848 --> 36:24.716
and steal money from my purse.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.520
I haven't gone soft.

36:28.554 --> 36:29.655
Stop saying that.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.690
("You're a Good Person" begins)

36:36.395 --> 36:37.763
Stop it.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.236
Don't get mushy,
you're making me blush.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.775
Remember, don't tell anyone.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.610
Then it's not really
a good deed.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.617
You always know what to say.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.321
*

37:17.035 --> 37:19.237
(indistinct chatter)

37:25.944 --> 37:28.680
I'm sorry.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.583
I'm really sorry.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.419
I don't want your forgiveness,
I'm just...

37:33.452 --> 37:35.454
I'm really sorry.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.391
I got stuck on, like,

37:39.425 --> 37:41.293
wanting you to say
I was a good person,

37:41.327 --> 37:43.962
because if you
believed it,

37:43.995 --> 37:46.298
then somehow I could
believe it, too.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.835
I can't say
you're a good person,

37:49.868 --> 37:52.938
but I saw what you did
for Darryl today,

37:52.971 --> 37:54.673
so I can say
you're a good friend.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.377
Not to me-- like,
definitely not to me--

37:58.410 --> 38:01.613
but to other people
that aren't me.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.888
So now that we're
kind of talking again...

38:09.921 --> 38:11.623
(exhales)

38:11.657 --> 38:13.625
...do you think I could
get a free beer?

38:13.659 --> 38:14.993
Because I'm down $10,000...

38:15.026 --> 38:17.463
Uh-uh. No.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.765
That's fair.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.406
REBECCA:
Wait, you settled
the Caswick case?

38:27.439 --> 38:28.707
I know!

38:28.740 --> 38:29.975
That was Cas-quick.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.477
(chuckles)

38:31.510 --> 38:32.811
Oh.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.414
Well, somebody got
a new stapler. Hmm!

38:35.447 --> 38:38.016
Wait. Seriously, Paula,
this is amazing.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.485
Like, how did
you do it?

38:39.518 --> 38:40.719
JIM:
Uh, I think you mean

38:40.752 --> 38:43.355
how did Pamela do it?
Eh?

38:43.389 --> 38:45.857
Dude, it's Paula,

38:45.891 --> 38:47.993
and that joke is super old.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.429
Oh, okay.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.965
See, Jim's like,
"Oh, duh, okay."
"Duh..."

38:53.999 --> 38:55.634
Oh... oh,
he has no friends.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.902
Oh, look how sad he is.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.003
Oh, he's so sad.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.038
Oh, he's crying
like a little baby.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.640
(Paula and Tim laughing)

39:01.673 --> 39:03.141
Oh...

39:03.174 --> 39:04.976
Now go wash my car, Tim.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.678
Okay.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.051
Well, I don't know what you did,
but I'm impressed.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.786
Thank you.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.788
So, let's get to work.
All right.

39:16.822 --> 39:17.823
(phone chimes)

39:20.959 --> 39:23.695
Right when I get back,
in a few minutes.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.699
Say hi to Josh for me.

39:27.733 --> 39:28.834
It's not...
I didn't move here...

39:28.867 --> 39:30.469
Uh...

39:30.502 --> 39:32.070
Hey.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.405
Hi, you texted?

39:33.439 --> 39:34.840
Yeah, I-I just, uh...

39:34.873 --> 39:35.974
I wanted to
talk to you.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.809
About what Greg said.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.877
It really
got me thinking.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.946
Yeah.
About me and you.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.548
And what's going
on between us.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.684
Oh... oh.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.985
Um...

39:47.018 --> 39:49.421
Oh, 'cause... Uh-huh.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.556
Do tell?

39:50.589 --> 39:54.025
Rebecca,
I've really looked within

39:54.059 --> 39:56.194
and thought
about everything and...

39:56.227 --> 39:57.763
I've made my choice.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.466
O-Okay.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.001
I want you to know,

40:03.034 --> 40:04.603
I am attracted to you.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.505
Very,

40:06.538 --> 40:08.607
very attracted to you.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.608
(echoing):
 Attracted to you...
 attracted to you...

40:09.641 --> 40:10.609
But the thing is...

40:10.642 --> 40:12.911
I love Valencia.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.713
I plan on staying
committed to her.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.015
...attracted to you,
 attracted to you...

40:17.048 --> 40:18.584
Rebecca, are you
listening to me?
Yeah!

40:18.617 --> 40:20.018
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.887
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.988
Yeah. Uh-huh.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.856
Yep. Mm-hmm.

40:24.890 --> 40:25.991
Joyce!

40:26.024 --> 40:27.459
(giggles)

40:27.493 --> 40:28.727
You are never gonna believe

40:28.760 --> 40:30.729
what Josh just said to me.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.764
(shrieking, laughing)

40:40.906 --> 40:44.142
Hey, guys. Um, welcome to
"Getting Real with Karen."

40:44.175 --> 40:45.944
This week's review:

40:45.977 --> 40:50.048
the Beaver Dam Menstrual Cup
by Lady Works.

40:50.081 --> 40:56.087
My review, in short?
My cup runneth over. Not good.
