WEBVTT

00:02.790 --> 00:05.456
Wonderful news, non-famouses.

00:05.576 --> 00:07.660
My publicist just called from rehab.

00:07.944 --> 00:09.633
I made the internet.

00:09.753 --> 00:11.463
You're on joanofsnark.com?

00:11.583 --> 00:13.178
- On what?
- Joanofsnark.

00:13.298 --> 00:14.986
It's this really cool
feminist web site

00:15.054 --> 00:16.921
where women talk about
how far we've come

00:16.973 --> 00:19.307
and which celebrities have
the worst beach bodies.

00:19.392 --> 00:21.459
Ruth Bader Ginsburg!

00:21.527 --> 00:24.262
"Comedy's freshest
female voice."

00:24.330 --> 00:26.064
Take that,
Courtney Thorne-Smith.

00:26.131 --> 00:27.532
That's not about you.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.235
That's about some stand-up
named Abby Flynn.

00:30.302 --> 00:31.686
- Wow.
- Lady.

00:31.771 --> 00:32.937
Pretty nostrils.

00:33.005 --> 00:34.306
How do I find me?

00:34.373 --> 00:36.741
Computer, "Jenna"!

00:36.809 --> 00:38.943
Oh, here's your article.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.145
"Why does 'TGS' hate women?"

00:41.197 --> 00:42.664
What?
How can they say that?

00:42.748 --> 00:43.948
We love women.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.334
With Tracy gone,
our last episode was all Jenna.

00:46.419 --> 00:47.919
This is Amelia Earhart.

00:47.986 --> 00:49.987
I'm almost across the Pacific...

00:50.039 --> 00:52.040
Oh, no.
My period!

00:53.426 --> 00:55.660
I'll now take questions.

00:55.728 --> 00:57.996
Oh, no.
My period!

00:58.064 --> 00:59.597
Let's nuke England!

00:59.665 --> 01:03.885
But that is an ironic
reappropriation.

01:03.969 --> 01:05.437
I don't know anymore.

01:05.504 --> 01:08.857
This started as a show
for women, starring women.

01:08.941 --> 01:10.859
At the very least,
we should be elevating

01:10.943 --> 01:12.861
the way women are perceived
in society.

01:12.945 --> 01:14.145
Oh, my period!

01:14.213 --> 01:16.381
You're all fired!

01:19.452 --> 01:29.390
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:37.920 --> 01:39.571
Jack.

01:39.638 --> 01:41.205
Do you think I hate women?

01:41.257 --> 01:43.541
Absolutely.
But it's not your fault.

01:43.609 --> 01:45.143
You are genetically predisposed

01:45.211 --> 01:46.678
to compete against other women

01:46.746 --> 01:50.248
for the attention of strong,
powerful men like myself

01:50.316 --> 01:51.383
or others very similar to me.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.885
For example, Hercules,

01:53.953 --> 01:56.521
the highlander, or,
uh...God.

01:56.589 --> 01:57.756
I want to roll my eyes right now,

01:57.823 --> 01:59.023
but the doctor said
if I keep doing it

01:59.091 --> 02:00.525
my ocular muscles might spasm

02:00.593 --> 02:02.260
and eject my eyeballs.

02:02.328 --> 02:04.462
Female jealousy
is an evolutionary fact, Lemon.

02:04.530 --> 02:05.997
If you try to breed
it out of them,

02:06.065 --> 02:08.066
you end up with a lesbian
with hip dysplasia.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.701
You're wrong.
I support women.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.235
I'm like a human bra,

02:11.287 --> 02:12.604
which is why I want
to hire a young comic

02:12.671 --> 02:15.373
named Abby Flynn to come on
as a guest writer.

02:15.441 --> 02:16.925
No, you are not budgeted...

02:17.009 --> 02:19.010
She's got good energy.
Hire her immediately.

02:19.078 --> 02:20.478
See?

02:20.546 --> 02:21.579
I'm not threatened by the fact

02:21.630 --> 02:22.881
that men are attracted to her.

02:22.948 --> 02:24.082
Please, Lemon.

02:24.150 --> 02:25.917
It's got nothing
to do with her hot mouth.

02:25.985 --> 02:27.085
Every organization
needs new blood

02:27.153 --> 02:28.386
once in a while.

02:28.437 --> 02:30.254
Like Hank Hooper says
in his book,

02:30.306 --> 02:33.057
"New blood is the lifeblood
of every company's blood."

02:33.125 --> 02:34.692
He's not a strong writer.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.994
Hank Hooper.

02:36.061 --> 02:37.529
Isn't that the guy
who outbid no one for NBC?

02:37.596 --> 02:39.531
Yes, he's the CEO of Kabletown,

02:39.598 --> 02:40.949
but he won't be forever.

02:41.033 --> 02:42.400
And someday, when he steps down,

02:42.451 --> 02:44.536
I intend to succeed him.

02:44.603 --> 02:46.738
Well, believe in yourself
and you will reach your goals.

02:46.806 --> 02:49.290
I read that on a bottle
of women's exercise water.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.675
Ah, it's not so simple.

02:50.743 --> 02:53.278
Kabletown is a family-owned
company.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.213
There is a potential successor,

02:55.281 --> 02:56.815
so to get what I want,

02:56.882 --> 02:58.283
I must find a way to destroy her.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.467
Her?
It's a woman?

02:59.552 --> 03:00.885
Well, not exactly.

03:00.953 --> 03:02.086
Hi, I'm Kaylie Hooper.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.838
I'm 14 years old
and I'm waiting in line

03:03.923 --> 03:05.340
to meet Justin Bieber
'cause he's...

03:06.809 --> 03:08.009
I'm sorry.

03:08.093 --> 03:09.561
Your new rival
is a ninth grade girl?

03:09.628 --> 03:11.095
How old is Hank's wife?

03:11.147 --> 03:12.230
Is it a second marriage?

03:12.297 --> 03:13.798
Why do men always marry
someone younger?

03:13.866 --> 03:15.166
"Because they can, Liz."

03:15.234 --> 03:16.401
Get a grip, Lemon.

03:16.468 --> 03:18.603
Kaylie is Hank Hooper's
granddaughter.

03:18.671 --> 03:19.821
Her parents' generation was lost

03:19.905 --> 03:21.656
to "trust fund kids" disease.

03:21.740 --> 03:24.242
The aunt smokes pot
and "paints."

03:24.310 --> 03:25.477
The father is trying to sail

03:25.544 --> 03:28.046
an inflatable castle
across the Atlantic.

03:28.113 --> 03:31.382
I have to ensure that Kaylie
makes similar choices.

03:31.450 --> 03:33.751
So you're trying to destroy
a 14-year-old?

03:33.819 --> 03:35.386
I am trying to guide
a 14-year-old.

03:35.454 --> 03:38.256
Maybe I could help her realize
some other life goal.

03:38.324 --> 03:40.558
To become a doctor's nurse

03:40.626 --> 03:42.060
or a lawyer's mistress

03:42.127 --> 03:43.661
or even the president
of the United States

03:43.729 --> 03:45.396
Shopping Association.

03:45.464 --> 03:46.948
Wow.
Typical.

03:47.032 --> 03:49.868
Meanwhile, I'm helping women
achieve their potential.

03:49.935 --> 03:51.369
Because potential
is the difference between

03:51.437 --> 03:53.571
what you can't do
and what can't you do.

03:53.639 --> 03:55.273
Did you get that off
of a water bottle?

03:55.341 --> 03:58.376
No, I sent it in,
but Aquafem did not choose it.

04:01.997 --> 04:03.448
Okay.

04:03.516 --> 04:06.751
Word is this Abby Flynn thing
is really happening.

04:06.819 --> 04:08.086
Girl coming!

04:08.153 --> 04:10.154
This is a big opportunity for us.

04:10.222 --> 04:12.657
She does not know
how much we suck.

04:12.725 --> 04:14.292
But she'll find out soon enough.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.627
I mean, how long did it take
the women here?

04:15.694 --> 04:16.827
I don't know.

04:16.896 --> 04:18.463
How long does it take
to see something?

04:18.531 --> 04:21.733
I mean, light travels at
186,000 miles per second, so...

04:21.800 --> 04:23.101
No duh!

04:23.168 --> 04:25.053
Being ourselves doesn't work.

04:25.137 --> 04:26.905
So to have a chance with Abby,

04:26.972 --> 04:29.007
we're creating new identities.

04:29.074 --> 04:31.842
I'm going to be pretend
to be rich.

04:31.894 --> 04:34.512
And I'll be a dangerous bad boy.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.047
And I shall be British.

04:36.115 --> 04:38.316
'Cause chicks dig British guys.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.118
Sir Ian McKellen?

04:40.185 --> 04:42.487
That dude must be knee-deep
in boob.

04:42.555 --> 04:43.888
And if you guys don't
go along with this,

04:43.956 --> 04:47.659
Lutz will play Xbox Kinect
with his shirt off again.

04:47.710 --> 04:52.130
Star jump!
I found the chrysalis!

04:52.197 --> 04:53.565
Rich, bad boy, British.
Got it.

04:53.632 --> 04:54.883
- Nice!
- All right!

04:54.967 --> 04:57.051
- Yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

04:57.136 --> 05:00.037
Now, you may have heard
of J. Fred Muggs,

05:00.089 --> 05:02.373
the chimpanzee that was
on <i>The Today Show</i> in the '50s.

05:02.441 --> 05:04.342
But what most people don't know

05:04.410 --> 05:07.178
is that NBC is still a network.

05:07.229 --> 05:08.713
Speaking of television,

05:08.781 --> 05:10.648
is that a field you would
like to go into, Kaylie?

05:10.716 --> 05:11.983
Work with your grandfather?

05:12.051 --> 05:13.351
Mmm.

05:13.419 --> 05:14.419
I agree.

05:14.486 --> 05:16.387
TV is boring.

05:16.438 --> 05:19.691
So do you have a favorite
subject in school, Kaylie?

05:19.742 --> 05:21.559
You don't want
to hear about school.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.027
It's dumb.

05:23.078 --> 05:24.462
What you talkin' 'bout, Kaylie?

05:24.530 --> 05:25.797
School's cool.

05:25.864 --> 05:27.732
Just like Justin "Bee-eye-bear."

05:27.800 --> 05:31.002
Well, I've never told anyone
in my family this before,

05:31.070 --> 05:34.072
but my dream is to be
a marine biologist.

05:34.139 --> 05:36.407
My favorite fish
is the cleaner wrasse

05:36.475 --> 05:37.759
and I even tried to get it chosen

05:37.843 --> 05:40.845
as our school mascot,
but, well, I was outvoted.

05:40.913 --> 05:43.114
So our new mascot is a slut.

05:43.182 --> 05:45.717
So you're interested
in marine biology.

05:45.784 --> 05:47.218
Hmm.
Who do I know?

05:47.286 --> 05:50.021
You've probably never heard
of the explorer Bob Ballard.

05:50.089 --> 05:51.589
You know Dr. Ballard?

05:51.657 --> 05:54.492
He discovered the <i>Titanic,</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Lusitania,</i>

05:54.560 --> 05:55.693
and according to his website,

05:55.761 --> 05:57.562
a guilt-free cheesecake
recipe.

05:57.630 --> 05:59.063
I'm also on the board
of the American Museum

05:59.131 --> 06:00.298
of Natural History.

06:00.366 --> 06:01.399
Ah!

06:01.467 --> 06:02.834
If you like,
I could have Dr. Ballard

06:02.901 --> 06:04.602
give us a private tour
of the museum.

06:04.670 --> 06:06.137
Oh, my gosh!

06:06.205 --> 06:08.740
Mr. Donaghy,
that'd be so cool!

06:08.791 --> 06:12.176
Okay, now, please follow me
to Brian Williams' bathroom,

06:12.244 --> 06:16.047
which is also
J. Fred Muggs' skull.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.455
Okay, guys,
Abby is on her way up.

06:24.523 --> 06:29.327
West ham drew nil-nil at wolves?

06:29.395 --> 06:30.628
Stop that!

06:30.696 --> 06:33.314
Are you guys changing your
personalities for Abby?

06:33.399 --> 06:35.266
Is she here yet?

06:35.334 --> 06:37.902
Subhas, you are married.

06:37.969 --> 06:40.905
Okay, this is exactly
the kind of male douchebaggery

06:40.973 --> 06:43.141
that is about to take
a real hit around here.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.644
Don't you know I'm talkin'
'bout a femolution?

06:46.695 --> 06:47.645
Tracy Chapman.

06:47.713 --> 06:49.347
She's a woman, right?

06:49.415 --> 06:51.749
It's a new era at "TGS."

06:51.817 --> 06:53.201
Let's see the blogosphere
try to say

06:53.285 --> 06:54.452
that I hate women now.

06:56.388 --> 06:59.323
Look at all these dudes!

06:59.391 --> 07:02.210
I knew I smelled sausage.

07:02.294 --> 07:03.961
Yes!

07:04.029 --> 07:04.962
Abby?
I'm Liz.

07:05.030 --> 07:06.664
Liz!

07:06.715 --> 07:08.182
Thank you!
Oh!

07:08.267 --> 07:09.967
Our nips just touched.

07:10.019 --> 07:12.020
Mine are so hard.

07:12.104 --> 07:14.972
Mine are different sizes.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.474
Abby, these are the writers.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.175
Oh, where's little Abby
gonna sit?

07:18.227 --> 07:21.646
Guess I'll have to sit
on somebody's lap.

07:21.714 --> 07:23.114
You could sit there.

07:23.165 --> 07:24.682
- Eenie...
- Please God.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.284
- Meenie...
- Come to mommy.

07:26.351 --> 07:27.852
- Minie...
- Me. Pick me.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.840
Moe!

07:32.925 --> 07:35.326
Give me strength, oh, Oprah.

07:37.467 --> 07:38.843
When I first started working here,

07:38.963 --> 07:40.907
an eight-year-old
Shirley Temple

07:41.027 --> 07:42.698
taught me how to roll
a cigarette.

07:42.818 --> 07:44.885
Lemon, who thinks
gesturing with one's thumbs

07:44.953 --> 07:48.005
is for poor people and is going
to be the next CEO of Kabletown?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.284
This guy.

07:49.352 --> 07:50.969
Already?
What did you do to her?

07:51.047 --> 07:51.763
Nothing.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.130
She wants to be
a marine biologist.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.205
Kaylie is playing right
into my hands.

07:56.206 --> 07:58.741
I also had a youthful
fascination with exploration

07:58.809 --> 08:02.224
and I know exactly what any
14-year-old science geek wants to do.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.509
Practice frottage on a poster
of Linda Ronstadt

08:04.576 --> 08:06.210
and meet your idol.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.379
Like when I met Jacques Cousteau.

08:08.447 --> 08:12.650
I will never forget
what he said to me.

08:12.718 --> 08:13.851
Oh, I did forget.

08:13.919 --> 08:15.153
It was so long ago.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.287
When I was a kid, I got to meet

08:16.338 --> 08:17.989
the "where's the beef" lady.

08:18.057 --> 08:19.857
With my connections, I can
make Kaylie's dreams come true.

08:19.925 --> 08:22.493
I should dig up my old shell
collection and give it to her.

08:22.561 --> 08:24.362
Complete the seduction
after Bob Ballard and I

08:24.430 --> 08:25.363
double-team her.

08:25.431 --> 08:26.631
Word choice, Jack.

08:26.699 --> 08:30.635
Withdrawn.

08:30.686 --> 08:31.869
Lemon, is that the new woman
you hired?

08:31.937 --> 08:34.889
Is it cold in here
or is it just that

08:34.972 --> 08:37.875
I'm not wearing any underwear?

08:39.010 --> 08:40.428
She should be careful
around the crew.

08:40.496 --> 08:41.729
New York gives us a tax break

08:41.797 --> 08:43.514
for employing sex offenders.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.400
- It's a terrible program.
- What's that?

08:45.484 --> 08:47.251
Oh, I don't know.
Is it a stain?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.903
Nobody knows.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.688
What is that?

08:50.756 --> 08:52.457
Ow.
That is Abby Flynn.

08:52.524 --> 08:53.891
She's a guest writer.

08:53.959 --> 08:56.577
She's being hot
and doing baby talk?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.496
I invented that.

08:58.564 --> 08:59.664
Summer of '98,

08:59.732 --> 09:01.566
I took it to a whole new level.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.337
There can't be two of us, Liz.

09:06.405 --> 09:08.239
She must be destroyed.

09:08.307 --> 09:10.725
Uh-huh.
I don't know how I got here.

09:10.809 --> 09:12.844
No, Jenna.
That is exactly the problem.

09:12.895 --> 09:15.763
Men infantilize women and women
tear each other down.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.148
Exactly.

09:17.216 --> 09:19.083
I'll start by spreading
a destructive rumor about her

09:19.151 --> 09:21.886
like the famous one I made up
about Jamie Lee Curtis.

09:21.954 --> 09:24.589
That she has two butts.

09:24.656 --> 09:26.774
Look, you and I actually
want the same thing,

09:26.859 --> 09:28.559
but we're not gonna destroy Abby.

09:28.627 --> 09:30.461
We're gonna fix her.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.764
Yes, like you fix a dog.

09:32.831 --> 09:34.232
We'll sterilize her.

09:34.299 --> 09:36.234
No, I'm gonna show Abby
that she doesn't need

09:36.301 --> 09:37.468
to act like this.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.703
Hi. I'm Jack.
It's nice to meet you.

09:38.754 --> 09:39.921
Hi.
I'm Abby. Hi.

09:43.442 --> 09:45.109
Ugh.
Whatever.

09:45.177 --> 09:47.178
So what do you think, Kaylie?

09:47.245 --> 09:49.764
Oceanography's
a pretty cool life.

09:49.848 --> 09:52.784
I can't believe I'm talking
to Dr. Robert Ballard.

09:52.851 --> 09:54.952
You're not.
"Bob" is short for "Bobert."

09:55.020 --> 09:56.304
Oh.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.523
Oh, my gosh.

09:58.590 --> 09:59.557
An anglerfish.

09:59.625 --> 10:02.727
<i>Lophius piscatorius.</i>

10:02.795 --> 10:04.495
That was my favorite fish
as a boy.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.563
Look at those teeth.

10:05.631 --> 10:07.398
You know that's a female.

10:07.466 --> 10:09.433
The male is much smaller
and is basically a parasite

10:09.501 --> 10:10.802
that lives on her.

10:10.869 --> 10:13.037
Until mating, of course.
Then the male dies.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.139
Yes, the scientific term
for that is "marriage."

10:16.542 --> 10:19.110
Don't tell Gina I said that.

10:19.178 --> 10:21.612
The ocean really is
the final frontier, Kaylie.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.948
And we keep finding new things.

10:24.016 --> 10:27.285
Giant tube worms
that breathe hydrogen sulfide.

10:27.352 --> 10:28.853
Arctic jellyfish.
Oh!

10:28.921 --> 10:31.856
And a chemical in kelp
that scientists think

10:31.924 --> 10:34.091
might one day cure
ice cream headaches.

10:34.159 --> 10:36.127
There's so much left to discover.

10:36.195 --> 10:38.029
And you could
be the one to do it.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.530
I kind of envy you.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.533
Youngsters are the future
of ocean exploration, Kaylie.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.435
I mean, I'm not gonna
live forever,

10:44.503 --> 10:46.604
no matter how much gold
I give Poseidon.

10:46.672 --> 10:50.708
That's why I'm making you
a student argonaut.

10:53.412 --> 10:54.712
I can't believe
this is happening!

10:55.914 --> 10:57.415
You already speak dolphin.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.817
Excellent.

10:59.868 --> 11:03.788
Is there an age cutoff
for the student argonauts?

11:03.856 --> 11:06.290
What if you gave me a sticker
as a joke?

11:08.360 --> 11:10.194
You know, Mr. Donaghy,
it...

11:10.262 --> 11:12.430
It seems you really love
this stuff.

11:12.497 --> 11:14.398
Maybe you should have been
a deep-sea explorer.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.766
Oh, no, Kaylie.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.468
That was a boyhood fantasy.

11:17.536 --> 11:18.686
I'm an adult now.

11:18.770 --> 11:21.505
I don't have fantasies anymore.

11:21.573 --> 11:24.742
Kaylie, this way.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.683
There she is, men.

11:32.734 --> 11:38.022
The elusive northern right whale.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.208
♪ Oh blow the wind westerly ♪

11:40.292 --> 11:42.076
♪ let the wind blow ♪

11:42.160 --> 11:43.861
♪ oh derry hi derry ♪

11:43.912 --> 11:45.296
♪ hey derry ho ♪

11:45.363 --> 11:46.747
Jack?
Jack?

11:46.832 --> 11:47.999
Yes, sailor?
What is it?

11:48.050 --> 11:51.002
We're moving on.

11:53.422 --> 11:59.227
Hey, Liz!

11:59.311 --> 12:00.478
Abby, thanks for meeting me here.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.263
This place is very special to me.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.916
Is this where you got
your v-card punched?

12:04.983 --> 12:06.284
What?
No.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.935
Does this look like the makeup
room of a clown academy?

12:08.020 --> 12:09.270
No, this is a statue...

12:09.354 --> 12:12.023
and I know you know this...
of Eleanor Roosevelt.

12:12.074 --> 12:13.491
First lady to the world,

12:13.558 --> 12:14.892
champion of the rights of women,

12:14.943 --> 12:17.078
and the lid on my high school
lunch box.

12:17.162 --> 12:19.563
Look, I know it can be hard.

12:19.631 --> 12:21.565
Society puts a lot
of pressure on us

12:21.617 --> 12:23.668
to act a certain way.

12:23.735 --> 12:25.369
But "TGS" is a safe place,

12:25.437 --> 12:28.372
so you can drop the sexy baby act

12:28.440 --> 12:29.590
and lose the pigtails...

12:29.675 --> 12:31.375
But I like my pigtails.

12:31.443 --> 12:33.311
My uncle says they're sexy.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.946
Enough with the gross jokes.

12:35.013 --> 12:36.480
And that voice!

12:36.548 --> 12:38.115
I want you to talk
in your real voice.

12:38.183 --> 12:39.583
This is my real voice.

12:39.651 --> 12:42.186
And the whole sexy baby thing
isn't an act.

12:42.253 --> 12:44.722
I'm a very sexy baby.

12:44.790 --> 12:48.259
I can't help it if men are
attracted to me.

12:48.327 --> 12:49.827
Like that homeless guy.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.929
He likes what he sees.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.147
Okay.
That could be for me.

12:53.231 --> 12:57.234
It's not!
It's for her!

12:57.302 --> 12:59.453
- Abby, I'm trying to help you.
- Really?

12:59.538 --> 13:01.973
By judging me on my appearance
and the way I talk?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.658
And what's the difference
between me

13:03.742 --> 13:06.978
using my sexuality and you using
those glasses to look smart?

13:07.045 --> 13:08.312
I am smart.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.497
I placed out of freshman German.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.682
Or Lutz using that sexy
English accent

13:11.750 --> 13:13.150
to get me in the sack?

13:13.218 --> 13:15.285
No! You didn't!
Lutz?

13:15.337 --> 13:16.587
Is that even possible?

13:16.655 --> 13:18.288
I mean, I was there
when he belvedered.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.425
God, Abby, you can't be that
desperate for male attention.

13:21.493 --> 13:22.593
You know what, Liz?

13:22.661 --> 13:23.728
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

13:23.795 --> 13:25.429
My life is none of your business.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.631
Except it is
because you represent my show

13:27.699 --> 13:29.299
and you represent my gender
in this business

13:29.351 --> 13:31.168
and you embarrass me.

13:31.236 --> 13:32.503
Kiss!

13:32.571 --> 13:35.439
Dude, I am sorry,
but this is who I am.

13:35.507 --> 13:36.807
Deal with it.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.976
Now are we gonna give
the gentleman

13:39.044 --> 13:42.113
what he asked for or not?

13:42.180 --> 13:43.864
Ugh.

13:51.895 --> 13:54.095
Kenneth, when I'm gone,

13:54.096 --> 13:56.314
how do you think people
will remember me?

13:56.382 --> 13:58.316
Actually, sir, I've already
started to compose

13:58.384 --> 14:00.819
a heroic ballad commemorating
your life.

14:00.886 --> 14:03.388
♪ Slaves of Jesus ♪

14:03.456 --> 14:05.423
♪ hear my tale ♪

14:05.491 --> 14:06.958
I'll tell you what they'll say.

14:07.026 --> 14:08.493
"Hey, remember Jack Donaghy?

14:08.561 --> 14:11.029
"He wore a lot of suits and went
to a lot of meetings.

14:11.097 --> 14:13.498
Now power down,
conversation robot."

14:13.566 --> 14:15.567
Sounds like you're asking some
pretty big questions.

14:15.634 --> 14:17.435
When I have problems,
I like to talk

14:17.503 --> 14:19.404
to the man upstairs.

14:19.455 --> 14:21.473
Unfortunately, Mr. Guzelian
got put in jail

14:21.540 --> 14:22.807
for attacking his father.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.677
I mean, what are we put
on this earth to do?

14:25.745 --> 14:27.295
Sit behind a desk?

14:27.380 --> 14:28.663
I'm still young, Kenneth.

14:28.748 --> 14:30.749
I could devote the time I have
left to other interests.

14:30.816 --> 14:32.450
Let Kaylie run Kabletown.

14:32.518 --> 14:34.669
I'll join Ballard's group
and become

14:34.754 --> 14:35.670
a scientist-adventurer.

14:35.755 --> 14:37.489
Now, that...

14:37.556 --> 14:39.174
Would be a legacy.

14:39.258 --> 14:41.693
I hope my legacy is
a <i>Sesame Street</i> type TV show

14:41.761 --> 14:45.263
that promotes illiteracy
in girls.

14:45.314 --> 14:46.765
This could be me.

14:46.832 --> 14:47.982
"Remember Jack Donaghy?

14:48.067 --> 14:51.186
"He was the world's greatest
oceanographer.

14:51.270 --> 14:52.904
"And we walruses
owe him everything

14:52.972 --> 14:56.775
for giving us the gift
of language."

14:56.842 --> 15:00.195
No.

15:00.279 --> 15:02.747
All right, your time is up,
my friend.

15:02.815 --> 15:05.450
I'm taking control
of this Abby situation.

15:05.518 --> 15:07.669
No, Jenna.
I'm not done.

15:07.753 --> 15:10.855
Check this out.

15:10.923 --> 15:12.490
I'm thinking to myself,
"whatever happened

15:12.541 --> 15:14.509
to the erasable pen?"

15:14.593 --> 15:17.462
Besides pencils,
who's saying that's a bad idea?

15:17.513 --> 15:18.696
I've always thought that,

15:18.764 --> 15:20.632
but I never had
the courage to say it.

15:20.699 --> 15:22.300
Is that Abby?

15:22.351 --> 15:24.669
I knew her boobs were fake.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.072
And that baby voice is fake too.

15:27.139 --> 15:29.774
You know, as someone
who speaks very naturally,

15:29.842 --> 15:31.242
I'm offended.

15:31.310 --> 15:34.396
She's taken on
a whole new identity.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.914
She changed her nose, her teeth.

15:35.981 --> 15:37.315
She even changed her name.

15:37.383 --> 15:39.384
It's not Abby Flynn.
It's Abby Grossman.

15:39.452 --> 15:40.952
Well, that's understandable.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.554
I mean, "Grossman"
is a little bagel-y.

15:42.621 --> 15:46.991
Abby used to be a strong,
smart, beautiful woman.

15:47.059 --> 15:49.711
Why did she transform herself
into that baby hooker?

15:49.795 --> 15:51.496
Oh.

15:51.564 --> 15:54.799
Children's book idea:
Baby hooker.

15:54.867 --> 15:55.934
Don't tell Liz.

15:56.001 --> 15:57.535
Well, I am confronting
Abby with this

15:57.586 --> 15:59.871
in front of everybody.

15:59.939 --> 16:01.940
Oh, that's vicious.

16:02.007 --> 16:04.509
Forget my idea.
Yours is so elegant.

16:04.577 --> 16:05.577
No, Jenna, for the last time,

16:05.644 --> 16:06.711
we're helping her.

16:06.779 --> 16:08.346
Say no more.

16:08.397 --> 16:10.515
Gotcha, boss.

16:12.184 --> 16:13.418
Who else is on the call?

16:13.486 --> 16:14.886
Katherine Scott, sales.

16:14.954 --> 16:16.688
Andy Hoberman, web sales.

16:16.755 --> 16:17.922
Gil Coughlin, oversight.

16:17.990 --> 16:19.791
I've got everyone
from meeting planning.

16:19.859 --> 16:23.228
Tricia, Maria, Greg,
Greg P., Lyle, Edwin.

16:23.295 --> 16:24.963
This is Charles.
I'm on for Douglas.

16:25.030 --> 16:26.197
No, Charles.
I'm on, but I just dialed in.

16:31.287 --> 16:33.788
Mr. Donaghy.

16:33.873 --> 16:34.906
What are you doing here?

16:34.974 --> 16:36.274
I could ask you the same thing,

16:36.342 --> 16:38.409
but that would make no sense.

16:40.463 --> 16:41.913
Where did you get
this picture of Cousteau?

16:41.981 --> 16:43.114
That?

16:43.182 --> 16:44.716
The Internet.

16:44.783 --> 16:46.851
This picture exists
in only two places.

16:46.919 --> 16:48.753
The negative is
in my personal safe

16:48.821 --> 16:51.189
along with my will
and some beanie babies

16:51.257 --> 16:52.590
that I thought would
be worth more.

16:52.658 --> 16:55.527
Or it could be found
in the right book.

16:55.594 --> 16:57.228
Ugh!

16:57.296 --> 16:58.329
Hey, what are you doing?

16:58.397 --> 16:59.481
Quiet, chalk-hands.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.065
A real man is talking.

17:01.116 --> 17:02.600
Why do you have this, Kaylie?

17:02.651 --> 17:04.801
Why are you reading
my autobiography?

17:04.869 --> 17:06.287
Well, uh...

17:13.012 --> 17:15.279
Same reason you're reading
Pop-Pop's book.

17:15.330 --> 17:17.415
Researching the enemy.

17:17.483 --> 17:18.715
So it's true.

17:18.784 --> 17:20.185
I was trying to make you think
you didn't want

17:20.252 --> 17:22.420
to run Kabletown, while you
were doing the same thing to me.

17:22.488 --> 17:24.806
What a super sleuth.

17:24.890 --> 17:25.924
You're just like Vanessa from

17:25.991 --> 17:27.458
the "Vampire Detective
Mysteries."

17:27.526 --> 17:28.993
I'm not familiar
with that reference,

17:29.061 --> 17:32.697
but I assume that Vanessa
is some kind of cool genius.

17:32.765 --> 17:34.299
You don't even like
the ocean, do you?

17:34.366 --> 17:36.834
I hate the ocean.
It's for tools.

17:36.902 --> 17:38.169
The ocean's awesome
and for winners.

17:38.237 --> 17:39.304
You're for tools.

17:39.371 --> 17:41.439
You can't beat me,
Mr. Donaghy!

17:41.490 --> 17:43.474
You worked your way
into this world,

17:43.542 --> 17:47.529
but I...
I was born into it.

17:47.613 --> 17:51.916
I breathe it.

17:51.984 --> 17:54.252
So watch your step.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.687
'Cause I can always tell Pop-Pop

17:55.754 --> 17:57.021
you gave me alcohol.

17:57.089 --> 17:58.856
And I can always seduce
one of your teachers

17:58.924 --> 18:00.091
and get her to fail you.

18:00.159 --> 18:01.859
- I'd be into that.
- Me too.

18:03.429 --> 18:05.997
Better pick up your books
or you'll be late for class.

18:06.065 --> 18:07.865
This is my free period.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.867
Well played.

18:14.106 --> 18:17.208
Megan, books!

18:20.195 --> 18:23.698
You know what sucked about
my last lesbian orgy?

18:23.782 --> 18:25.416
Right in the middle of it,

18:25.484 --> 18:28.019
one of us had to get up
to go use the bathroom

18:28.070 --> 18:30.488
and then we all had to go!

18:30.539 --> 18:33.224
Okay, there's something
everyone here needs to see.

18:33.292 --> 18:35.059
Abby, you might want
to sit down for this.

18:35.127 --> 18:36.761
Yeah, come sit on my <i>struikgewas.</i>

18:36.829 --> 18:38.997
On a chair.
Come on, Sue.

18:39.048 --> 18:40.999
Abby, this is for your own good.

18:41.066 --> 18:44.552
Open apple, tough love time.

18:44.637 --> 18:47.872
Has anyone ever actually
had a good time at brunch?

18:47.940 --> 18:49.674
- You know...
- Is that you?

18:49.742 --> 18:51.676
I don't know where
you found that,

18:51.744 --> 18:53.945
but I am taking it down.

18:55.281 --> 18:57.381
That's what she said!

18:57.433 --> 18:59.050
Hey, first of all,
Steve Carell owns

18:59.101 --> 19:00.151
"that's what she said."

19:00.218 --> 19:01.402
He owns it.

19:01.487 --> 19:03.404
And second of all,
it's time to stop hiding.

19:03.489 --> 19:06.391
A young person helped me
online post this

19:06.458 --> 19:08.926
on joanofsnark.com.

19:08.994 --> 19:11.112
You stupid, meddling bitch!

19:11.196 --> 19:12.396
Yes!
There's your real voice.

19:12.448 --> 19:13.698
There's Abby Grossman.

19:13.749 --> 19:15.433
To quote Eleanor Roosevelt,

19:15.501 --> 19:16.868
"We are all..."

19:16.935 --> 19:18.002
Do you understand
what you've done?

19:18.070 --> 19:19.937
You have signed my death warrant.

19:20.005 --> 19:20.972
How's that now?

19:21.040 --> 19:22.507
My ex-husband
is gonna see this.

19:22.574 --> 19:23.708
He's gonna find out where I am

19:23.776 --> 19:24.709
and he is gonna try
to run me over

19:24.777 --> 19:26.744
with his car again.

19:26.795 --> 19:29.914
I changed my appearance
to get away from him!

19:29.982 --> 19:31.549
Oh, 'cause I thought
it was, like,

19:31.617 --> 19:33.284
pressure from society.

19:33.352 --> 19:34.385
You're right, Liz.

19:34.453 --> 19:35.953
I was hiding from a man

19:36.021 --> 19:38.255
who went insane after
being electrocuted

19:38.307 --> 19:40.058
while watching
<i>Sleeping with the Enemy.</i>

19:40.109 --> 19:41.359
I was cut out of that.

19:41.427 --> 19:43.260
Oh, yeah, I am desperate
for male attention,

19:43.312 --> 19:45.163
because I feel safer
having men around

19:45.230 --> 19:47.098
in case Troy comes back.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.567
That is why I slept with Lutz.

19:49.618 --> 19:51.486
And I shall protect her.

19:51.570 --> 19:52.570
Is there an Abby Flynn here?

19:52.621 --> 19:53.655
That's her, Troy!

19:53.739 --> 19:54.739
I'm on your side!
Get her!

19:54.807 --> 19:55.907
Geez, Lutz.
It's the ups guy.

19:55.974 --> 19:59.811
Okay, I think we all owe
Abby an apology.

19:59.878 --> 20:01.112
Oh, my God.
It's from him.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.047
"I thought this box would
be the perfect size

20:03.115 --> 20:04.649
"for your head.

20:04.717 --> 20:08.119
P.S. I was electrocuted again
while watching <i>Seven."</i>

20:08.170 --> 20:09.387
Great.

20:09.455 --> 20:11.022
I have six hours
to start a new life.

20:11.090 --> 20:13.057
I'll have to be
a redhead this time.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.760
Oh, I don't know,
with your coloring.

20:15.811 --> 20:17.895
You know what?
Don't listen to me.

20:17.963 --> 20:19.864
You must really hate women, Liz.

20:19.932 --> 20:24.468
Liz Lemon is a Judas
to all womankind!

20:29.675 --> 20:31.475
Okay.

20:31.527 --> 20:33.778
We were on page six...

20:33.846 --> 20:35.863
Where Wonder Woman...

20:35.948 --> 20:37.849
Gets her period.

20:37.969 --> 20:41.703

20:41.823 --> 20:43.023
Tonight's tag is gonna be a nice

20:43.091 --> 20:45.519
wrap-up scene between
Jack and Liz.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.887
After all, they spent
the whole episode

20:46.955 --> 20:48.188
trying to help young women.

20:48.256 --> 20:49.623
But, first,
I would like to correct

20:49.691 --> 20:51.792
some of the science
we saw tonight.

20:51.860 --> 20:55.663
There is no oil in kelp that
helps cure ice cream headaches.

20:55.730 --> 20:58.659
No, the only thing that will
cure ice cream headaches

20:58.779 --> 21:00.223
is having sex on a motorcycle.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.886
Kailey was not speaking dolphin.

21:02.138 --> 21:04.398
When a dolphin expresses excitement

21:04.518 --> 21:06.076
it sounds like this.

21:09.047 --> 21:11.940
Okay, we got a lot of fun
tonight and it's not over.

21:12.060 --> 21:16.253
In the time remaining we're gonna go to that
Jack and Liz wrap up scene I promised you.

21:17.917 --> 21:19.325
Well, Lemon...
