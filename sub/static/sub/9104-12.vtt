<i>&lrm;In the daytime, I'm Marinette,</i>

00:04.720 --> 00:06.840
<i>&lrm;just a normal girl with a normal life,</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:10.480
<i>&lrm;but there's something</i>
<i>&lrm;that no-one knows yet,</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:13.080
<i>&lrm;because I have a secret.</i>

00:13.200 --> 00:15.600

<i>&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>
<i>&lrm;saved Paris again.</i>

00:31.720 --> 00:33.720
&lrm;And yet again, I hope I have time

00:33.880 --> 00:35.440
&lrm;to finish my magic box.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.320
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;What's it for?

00:37.480 --> 00:39.560
&lrm;To lock up my diary and secrets.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.000
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;Every secret?

00:41.160 --> 00:43.440
&lrm;You write everything in there?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.640
&lrm;Well... yeah. Why?

00:45.800 --> 00:48.600
&lrm;First, what if someone finds out
&lrm;you're Ladybug?

00:48.760 --> 00:51.560
&lrm;And two, what if
&lrm;someone finds out your ladybag?

00:51.920 --> 00:53.560
&lrm;Not gonna happen. Try it.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.280
&lrm;Hey!

00:56.440 --> 00:57.680
&lrm;It works.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.120
<i>&lrm;Mr. Bourgeois was re-elected</i>

01:00.280 --> 01:02.520
<i>&lrm;as mayor of Paris for the 4th term.</i>

01:02.680 --> 01:04.720
<i>&lrm;Here, we see him with his daughter.</i>

01:04.879 --> 01:05.960
&lrm;Look at Chloe.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.400
&lrm;acting as if she were the mayor.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.520
&lrm;Which reminds me,
&lrm;class elections are tomorrow!

01:11.680 --> 01:12.920
&lrm;What's bad about that?

01:13.080 --> 01:15.000
&lrm;Chloe is running for class rep,

01:15.160 --> 01:19.280
&lrm;the person who cares about herself
&lrm;more than students.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.200
&lrm;Well, maybe you should run.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.520
&lrm;I totally would

01:22.680 --> 01:26.360
&lrm;but I've enough to do
&lrm;with Ladybug and my schoolwork.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.040
&lrm;But if you believe in something,
&lrm;you have to try.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.880
&lrm;It's better to fail trying
&lrm;than not trying.

01:33.040 --> 01:33.960
&lrm;Maybe.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.120
&lrm;Don't underestimate yourself.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.520
<i>&lrm;Mr. D'Argencourt,</i>
<i>&lrm;Bourgeois's opponent,</i>

01:38.680 --> 01:40.120
<i>&lrm;and a fencing instructor</i>

01:40.280 --> 01:43.280
<i>&lrm;at Françoise Dupont school,</i>
<i>&lrm;was pummelled in the polls,</i>

01:43.440 --> 01:46.520
<i>&lrm;with the least number</i>
<i>&lrm;of votes in Paris history.</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:49.720
&lrm;I'm gonna be late for school, again.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.680
&lrm;See? This is what I'm talking about.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.560
&lrm;[teacher] Chloe is running
&lrm;for class representative.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.160
&lrm;Sabrina will be her deputy.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.360
&lrm;Any other candidates?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.680
&lrm;- Yes, Kim?
&lrm;- N-Nothing.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.520
&lrm;I'm sorry. I...

02:05.680 --> 02:06.720
&lrm;The bus...

02:06.880 --> 02:09.039
&lrm;[coughing]
&lrm;Dry throat.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.680
&lrm;Chloe is running again.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.160
&lrm;She's been class rep
&lrm;since kindergarten.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.480
&lrm;[gasping] Why don't you run?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.320
&lrm;You'd be an awesome rep.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.200
&lrm;No can do. My blog is a full-time job.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.280
&lrm;[teacher] Alright,

02:21.400 --> 02:24.160
&lrm;I'll give you
&lrm;until the end of lunch to decide.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.280
&lrm;[Chloe] Or I'll tell everyone.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.000
&lrm;[chattering]

02:29.720 --> 02:33.320
&lrm;What did Chloe say this time?
&lrm;She offered to go on a date you?

02:33.480 --> 02:36.200
&lrm;She said she'd tell everyone
&lrm;I'm afraid of spiders.

02:36.360 --> 02:40.080
&lrm;She said I'd get kicked out
&lrm;of Scrapbooking Club.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.320
&lrm;And you know I love all that
&lrm;colourful paper and gluing.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.400
&lrm;I don't care about running.
&lrm;What's your excuse?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.960
&lrm;[hesitantly] Well, I'm ... really busy.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.480
&lrm;With what, oversleeping?

02:54.640 --> 02:57.280
&lrm;Well, no... but...well...

02:57.440 --> 03:00.680
&lrm;I guess I would run if no one else did.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.200
&lrm;Do any new candidates
&lrm;want to run against Chloe?

03:05.240 --> 03:06.480
&lrm;[groaning]

03:06.960 --> 03:07.720
&lrm;[sigh] No.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.720
&lrm;[whimpering]

03:09.360 --> 03:10.520
&lrm;[groaning]

03:11.200 --> 03:13.520
&lrm;Chloe and Sabrina are the only candidates,

03:13.680 --> 03:15.720
&lrm;so there's no vote. Chloe, Sabrina...

03:17.000 --> 03:18.480
&lrm;I'll run!

03:18.640 --> 03:20.680
&lrm;Wonderful! Develop your campaign

03:20.840 --> 03:24.000
&lrm;and have a speech ready
&lrm;for tomorrow when we vote.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.920
&lrm;[chattering]

03:27.400 --> 03:29.560
&lrm;Let's hear the scoop on your campaign.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.360
&lrm;How are you gonna represent?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.560
&lrm;Represent?

03:32.720 --> 03:36.240
&lrm;I have no idea.
&lrm;I can't believe I raised my hand.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.680
&lrm;Way to go, Marinette.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.000
&lrm;You spoke from the heart.
&lrm;It was truly authentic.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.360
&lrm;[gasping] Oh... thanks.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.880
&lrm;When you win, can we get new chairs?

03:46.040 --> 03:49.320
&lrm;Ours are so hard I can't think.
&lrm;Maybe pink ones!

03:49.640 --> 03:52.640
&lrm;Could we listen to music in the library?

03:52.800 --> 03:55.840
&lrm;[mumbling] You know... I... you know.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.160
&lrm;[nervous laugh] Sure, Juleka.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.320
&lrm;Adrien!

03:59.480 --> 04:01.280
&lrm;Can Marinette count on your vote?

04:01.440 --> 04:03.240
&lrm;Sure, depending on her speech.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.040
&lrm;Better get cracking then.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.120
&lrm;I've watched how my daddy wins elections.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.160
&lrm;I'm going to follow in his footsteps.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.840
&lrm;I know just how to win.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.680
&lrm;By having the best campaign?

04:14.840 --> 04:16.480
&lrm;Whatever!

04:16.640 --> 04:18.240
&lrm;The secret to winning

04:18.399 --> 04:20.959
&lrm;is ruining your opponent's reputation.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.960
&lrm;Softer chairs...

04:25.120 --> 04:26.680
&lrm;music in library,

04:26.840 --> 04:28.320
&lrm;whatever Juleka said.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.360
&lrm;I'm writing down all the issues.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.640
&lrm;I just have to get it all in my speech.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.200
&lrm;I'm proud of you. I'm sure you'll win.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.800
&lrm;You'll be an awesome rep.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.920
&lrm;They're relying on me to defeat Chloe,

04:39.080 --> 04:41.240
&lrm;even Adrian, do you realise that?

04:41.400 --> 04:42.840
&lrm;[phone vibrates]

04:43.320 --> 04:45.680
&lrm;- <i>&lrm;Marinette, battles on.</i>
&lrm;- Why?

04:45.840 --> 04:48.640
&lrm;Chloe invited everyone
&lrm;to her campaign launch.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.600
&lrm;She's got Jagged Stone coming.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.560
&lrm;Seriously? Jagged Stone my favourite star.

04:53.920 --> 04:54.920
&lrm;I love him!

04:55.080 --> 04:56.920
&lrm;[groaning] As does everyone else.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.800
<i>&lrm;She's trying to buy votes with autographs.</i>

04:59.960 --> 05:01.920
&lrm;Not if I have anything to say about it.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.160
&lrm;Meet you there.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.600
&lrm;[dramatic music]

05:07.760 --> 05:08.880
&lrm;[bell rings]

05:10.440 --> 05:12.000
&lrm;I'm going in, Chloe.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.800
&lrm;[bell rings]

05:13.960 --> 05:15.280
&lrm;- Hello.
&lrm;- Hi, there.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.800
&lrm;Marinette borrowed my math book
&lrm;but I need it back.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.720
&lrm;She isn't here.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.520
&lrm;I've got customers to attend to.
&lrm;Go on up if you don't mind.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.400
&lrm;I'd be glad to, thanks.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.080
&lrm;[struggling]

05:32.240 --> 05:34.480
&lrm;[struggling]

05:38.520 --> 05:40.080
&lrm;Wow, Mr. D'Argencourt.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.640
&lrm;You're on fire. That was some attack.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.640
&lrm;It ought to be. This manoeuvre
&lrm;was developed by my ancestor,

05:47.800 --> 05:49.400
&lrm;- Darkblade.
&lrm;- Darkblade?

05:49.880 --> 05:54.200
&lrm;Darkblade conquered Paris
&lrm;and ruled over it with an iron fist

05:54.360 --> 05:57.000
&lrm;until he was overthrown
&lrm;by a wealthy Frenchman

05:57.160 --> 06:00.320
&lrm;who used gold to buy
&lrm;the loyalties of the people.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.240
<i>&lrm;Not long ago, my ancestors' flag</i>
<i>&lrm;was waving above Paris.</i>

06:04.400 --> 06:08.480
<i>&lrm;Is that why you ran</i>
<i>&lrm;in the election, to seek revenge?</i>

06:08.640 --> 06:10.840
&lrm;Par le fer.
<i>&lrm;Who dost we have hither?</i>

06:11.000 --> 06:13.800
<i>&lrm;Nadia Chamack.</i>
<i>&lrm;Don't be bemused, it's just The News.</i>

06:13.960 --> 06:17.520
<i>&lrm;Do you have anything to say about</i>
<i>&lrm;your "landslide defeat"?</i>

06:17.680 --> 06:19.640
<i>&lrm;Hey, you. How did you get in here?</i>

06:19.800 --> 06:21.480
&lrm;- <i>&lrm;Time to go.</i>
&lrm;- Get back here.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.840
&lrm;Here endeth the lesson.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.680
&lrm;[evil voice] A loser and an utter failure,

06:30.840 --> 06:33.720
&lrm;the perfect candidate
&lrm;to lobby my own campaign.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.200
&lrm;[dramatic music]

06:38.360 --> 06:40.120
&lrm;[whooshing]

06:40.280 --> 06:42.640
&lrm;Fly away, my evil little Akuma,

06:42.800 --> 06:45.840
&lrm;and take control of this defeated fighter.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.120
&lrm;[dramatic music]

06:54.320 --> 06:56.560
&lrm;Mr. D'Argencourt, someone said

06:56.720 --> 07:01.480
&lrm;"You're stuck in the dark ages."
&lrm;What do you have to say to that?

07:01.920 --> 07:03.480
&lrm;Poisonous wretch.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.760
&lrm;Stop thou venomous questions?
&lrm;Be gone, you pain in the neck!

07:07.920 --> 07:09.120
&lrm;[groaning]

07:09.480 --> 07:10.680
&lrm;[roaring]

07:10.840 --> 07:14.240
&lrm;[dramatic music]

07:16.520 --> 07:18.200
&lrm;[whooshing]

07:18.360 --> 07:19.680
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Darkblade,

07:19.840 --> 07:21.520
&lrm;in return for these powers,

07:21.680 --> 07:24.840
&lrm;capture Ladybug's
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

07:25.600 --> 07:31.000
&lrm;When the flag of mine ancestors
&lrm;flies once again upon City Hall,

07:31.160 --> 07:33.640
&lrm;then to thee I shall be indebted.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.920
&lrm;[dramatic music]

07:37.080 --> 07:39.800
&lrm;Anything y-you'd like to say
&lrm;about your transformation

07:39.960 --> 07:42.160
&lrm;- into a...
&lrm;- Darkblade,

07:42.320 --> 07:43.680
&lrm;the Lord of Paris.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.600
&lrm;[zapping]
&lrm;[gasping]

07:49.280 --> 07:51.360
&lrm;Thou shalt become mine knights.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.600
&lrm;Soon mine army shalt be
&lrm;immense and unstoppable.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.000
&lrm;We shalt take City Hall

07:57.160 --> 07:59.960
&lrm;and reclaim the throne
&lrm;from Bourgeois, the usurper.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.400
&lrm;[Plagg] That's some medieval madness.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.680
&lrm;Time to transform.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.400
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

08:09.800 --> 08:10.560
&lrm;[lively music]

08:23.080 --> 08:26.400
&lrm;What a great beast
&lrm;to join our conquest.

08:28.520 --> 08:37.240
&lrm;[chanting]
<i>&lrm;PAR LE FER! PAR LE FER!</i>

08:37.400 --> 08:39.360
&lrm;[D'Argencourt]
&lrm;Let us to battle, knights!

08:39.520 --> 08:40.799
<i>&lrm;PAR LE FER!</i>

08:43.520 --> 08:46.240
&lrm;The people chose Bourgeois over you.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
&lrm;Thy peoples matter not to me.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.800
&lrm;D'Argencourt was defeated,
&lrm;not Darkblade.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.240
<i>&lrm;En garde!</i>

08:52.720 --> 08:53.480
&lrm;Chloe,

08:53.640 --> 08:55.640
<i>&lrm;I'm in. What am I looking for?</i>

08:55.800 --> 08:58.680
<i>&lrm;Anything,</i>
<i>&lrm;as long as it's totally embarrassing.</i>

09:01.600 --> 09:04.360
&lrm;Wait... I have one just like this.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.960
&lrm;How about... a ball of yarn?
&lrm;Or a screwdriver.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.960
<i>&lrm;No, dingbat, a disgusting photo of her,</i>

09:12.120 --> 09:13.960
<i>&lrm;or some tacky clothing.</i>

09:14.120 --> 09:15.520
<i>&lrm;Dig around a bit.</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:18.720
&lrm;[gasping] How about her diary!

09:18.880 --> 09:22.200
<i>&lrm;Wow, you can actually do something</i>
<i>&lrm;when you put my mind to it.</i>

09:22.600 --> 09:23.800
&lrm;[shrieking]

09:23.960 --> 09:25.680
<i>&lrm;Sabrina? Sabrina!</i>

09:31.280 --> 09:32.720
&lrm;Welcome all,

09:32.880 --> 09:35.440
&lrm;to the launch
&lrm;of Chloe's electoral campaign.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.240
&lrm;And a special thank you

09:37.400 --> 09:40.840
&lrm;to world-famous popstar
&lrm;Jagged Stone for endorsing her

09:42.120 --> 09:43.360
&lrm;If you vote for me,

09:43.520 --> 09:46.880
&lrm;you'll get free tickets
&lrm;to Jagged's next concert.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.640
&lrm;[she screams]

09:50.960 --> 09:53.120
&lrm;[angrily] You got an autograph?

09:54.320 --> 09:58.040
&lrm;Yeah. Got you one, too.
&lrm;Sorry, couldn't help myself.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.120
&lrm;No, I'm not falling for it.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.360
&lrm;But I'll forgive you if you vote for me.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.640
&lrm;[struggling]
&lrm;[groaning]

10:10.320 --> 10:12.120
&lrm;[groaning]

10:13.840 --> 10:15.600
&lrm;How did I not see that coming?

10:15.960 --> 10:17.000
&lrm;Take him.

10:17.160 --> 10:21.080
&lrm;[roaring]

10:21.240 --> 10:23.120
&lrm;Not a minute to be wasted.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.920
&lrm;City Hall awaits us!

10:26.480 --> 10:27.320
&lrm;City Hall?

10:27.480 --> 10:29.160
&lrm;You go first. I'll catch up.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.080
&lrm;[panting]

10:33.240 --> 10:35.920
&lrm;What took you?
&lrm;You better have her diary.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.760
&lrm;I did... sorta.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.560
&lrm;What's that?

10:41.720 --> 10:45.200
&lrm;When I grabbed the diary,
&lrm;this crazy box closed on my hand.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.280
&lrm;And I'm supposed to believe you?

10:47.440 --> 10:49.200
&lrm;[angry sigh] Why do I bother?

10:49.360 --> 10:51.480
&lrm;Do you realise you're being bribed?

10:51.640 --> 10:55.080
&lrm;Concert tickets are awesome,
&lrm;but they won't solve our problems.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.920
&lrm;What's your campaign then?

10:57.080 --> 10:58.720
&lrm;Well... I'm...

10:58.880 --> 11:01.960
&lrm;I think cushions are
&lrm;more realistic than new chairs.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.120
&lrm;Your cushion could be pink.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.800
&lrm;I'll see about music in the library,
&lrm;using headphones.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.400
&lrm;Remarkable.
&lrm;You actually sound like a class rep.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.840
&lrm;Too bad you have no chance of winning.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.400
&lrm;A word?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.400
&lrm;My diary! What were you...?

11:19.560 --> 11:24.000
&lrm;If you don't pull out,
&lrm;all your secrets will be revealed.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.080
&lrm;Don't! I mean... What secrets?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.040
&lrm;We'll find out,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.200
&lrm;as soon as I get my hands on a chainsaw.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.440
&lrm;Oh ye, oh ye!
&lrm;Darkblade shalt speak now.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.280
&lrm;Listen or be imprisoned!

11:45.600 --> 11:49.520
&lrm;Henceforth,
&lrm;my flag shalt fly over thy kingdom.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.200
&lrm;Bourgeois, pathetic knave,
&lrm;come hither and do battle!

11:53.680 --> 11:54.760
&lrm;What did he say?

11:54.920 --> 11:57.200
&lrm;Basically, he's gonna bust you up.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.840
&lrm;Ask my secretary for an appointment.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.840
&lrm;[cackling] Bow down to Darkblade

12:03.000 --> 12:05.240
&lrm;or feel the wrath of mine sword!

12:05.600 --> 12:08.280
<i>&lrm;PAR LE FER! PAR LE FER!</i>

12:08.440 --> 12:11.920
&lrm;[charging]

12:13.520 --> 12:14.680
&lrm;[crashing]

12:15.920 --> 12:16.760
&lrm;Take him!

12:17.360 --> 12:19.080
&lrm;Do you only know heavy metal?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.160
&lrm;[struggling]

12:23.240 --> 12:24.200
&lrm;[groaning]

12:26.000 --> 12:27.720
&lrm;[struggling]

12:27.880 --> 12:29.280
&lrm;[Cat Noir laughs]

12:29.440 --> 12:31.880
&lrm;Ouch. Cat Noir, hurry.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.160
&lrm;[knights groan]
&lrm;Nice warmup.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.160
<i>&lrm;Par le fer!</i>

12:37.400 --> 12:38.640
&lrm;[roaring]

12:38.800 --> 12:43.480
&lrm;[struggling]

12:43.640 --> 12:45.920
&lrm;Is that the sound of crazed fans?

12:46.080 --> 12:48.600
&lrm;I can get them under control.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.920
&lrm;[awful singing]

12:55.400 --> 12:59.800
&lrm;[struggling]

12:59.960 --> 13:01.720
&lrm;[roaring]

13:01.880 --> 13:03.560
&lrm;Behold, a minstrel.

13:03.720 --> 13:07.520
&lrm;Guys, guys, I know you love me,
&lrm;but no reason to fight over it.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.560
&lrm;Are you the usurper's champion?

13:09.720 --> 13:10.960
&lrm;Say what?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.120
&lrm;- No!
&lrm;- What are we gonna do?

13:17.920 --> 13:20.480
&lrm;- The doors, quickly!
&lrm;- The doors, quickly!

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
&lrm;- Quit, Chloe.
&lrm;- Quit, Chloe.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.720
&lrm;[Darkblade]
&lrm;Kneel before thy flag of Darkblade.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.680
&lrm;Bow down before mine eyes.

13:27.960 --> 13:32.000
&lrm;Cloe, what should we do?
&lrm;What would a class rep do?

13:32.160 --> 13:33.760
&lrm;Well, if you vote for me

13:33.920 --> 13:36.040
&lrm;I'll give you an answer... tomorrow.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.960
&lrm;But we can't wait that long.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.560
&lrm;Then tough luck. Ask someone else.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.600
&lrm;[lively music] Tikki, we need to talk.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.880
&lrm;What are you going to do?

13:49.040 --> 13:52.480
&lrm;Cat Noir needs Ladybug,
&lrm;but the students need me too.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.000
&lrm;Trust your instincts.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.560
&lrm;[roaring]

13:59.160 --> 14:00.960
&lrm;[roaring]
&lrm;[thudding]

14:01.120 --> 14:02.600
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;Lock the doors

14:02.760 --> 14:03.880
&lrm;and the windows.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.080
&lrm;Quickly!

14:05.760 --> 14:08.440
&lrm;Nino, Juleka, Rose,
&lrm;Mylene, Alya come with me.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.520
&lrm;Good job, girl.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.720
&lrm;Now there's a future class rep
&lrm;in the making.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.760
&lrm;Well, I was going to say
&lrm;the exact same thing.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.720
&lrm;Sabrina, Ivan, Kim,
&lrm;go and lock the doors.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.120
&lrm;Charge!

14:22.840 --> 14:24.400
&lrm;Barricade the entrance.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.520
&lrm;[thudding]
&lrm;[roaring]

14:27.680 --> 14:28.720
&lrm;[Nino] Hurry.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.400
&lrm;[roaring]
&lrm;[thudding]

14:30.560 --> 14:31.840
&lrm;[thudding]

14:32.920 --> 14:35.640
&lrm;- I hope Cat Noir's OK.
&lrm;- Time to retreat.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.840
&lrm;Sir, we have to go.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.720
&lrm;This way.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.480
&lrm;I'll catch up.
&lrm;I'll close all the windows.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.520
&lrm;They should be safe now.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

14:50.520 --> 14:52.480
&lrm;[lively music]

15:02.400 --> 15:03.720
&lrm;Back off, tin cans.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.520
&lrm;Cat Noir, over here.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.960
&lrm;[groaning]

15:08.120 --> 15:10.880
&lrm;Sorry, I was busy
&lrm;doing damage control inside.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.600
&lrm;I was managing just fine
&lrm;but it's always nice to see you.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.960
&lrm;Column formation!

15:16.840 --> 15:20.880
&lrm;[grunting]

15:25.560 --> 15:28.440
&lrm;[groaning]

15:28.600 --> 15:30.000
&lrm;Strike!

15:30.160 --> 15:32.320
&lrm;Cursed colourful acrobats.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.360
&lrm;[dramatic music]

&lrm;[whooshing]

15:39.000 --> 15:40.560
&lrm;[struggling]
&lrm;Pull!

15:40.880 --> 15:42.040
&lrm;[shouting]

15:42.200 --> 15:43.560
&lrm;Why the roof?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.880
&lrm;- Some of them anyway.
&lrm;- The flag.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.520
&lrm;Tallyho!

15:49.080 --> 15:50.920
&lrm;[cackling]

15:51.080 --> 15:53.560
&lrm;Once mine coat of arms flies here,

15:53.720 --> 15:55.760
&lrm;I shalt reign supreme.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.360
&lrm;- The Akuma's in his sword.
&lrm;- How do we get it?

16:01.520 --> 16:02.960
&lrm;By getting close to him.

16:05.400 --> 16:10.320
&lrm;[panting]

16:10.480 --> 16:11.960
&lrm;[she roars]

16:15.840 --> 16:16.960
&lrm;Cat Noir!

16:17.120 --> 16:18.840
&lrm;Don't let him get his banner!

16:19.480 --> 16:21.680
&lrm;[groaning]

16:21.840 --> 16:23.640
&lrm;Villains. Thou impress me not.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.920
&lrm;By the blade of darkness, I declare

16:26.080 --> 16:29.200
&lrm;all peoples of this kingdom
&lrm;are henceforth mine!

16:29.360 --> 16:31.760

16:57.760 --> 16:59.680

16:59.840 --> 17:03.560
&lrm;Soon thou shalt join my army,
&lrm;you venomous insect.

&lrm;Not... so... fast! <i>&lrm;En garde!</i>

17:09.839 --> 17:13.720

17:20.680 --> 17:26.640

17:26.800 --> 17:28.640
&lrm;We'll be turned into knights.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.800
&lrm;[confused] OK?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.600
&lrm;[struggling]

17:58.080 --> 17:59.440
&lrm;Not this time.

&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, Akuma.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.280
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:26.440 --> 18:28.840
&lrm;[lively music]

18:29.000 --> 18:30.040
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:31.320 --> 18:32.960
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

&lrm;POUND IT!

18:45.720 --> 18:47.920
&lrm;[he gasps] Gotta take off. See ya.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.960
&lrm;Our duel is not over, my dear Ladybug.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.840
&lrm;At the end of our battle,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
&lrm;I will rule!

19:02.120 --> 19:03.360
&lrm;Great job.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.680
&lrm;You proved you can be
&lrm;both Ladybug and class rep.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.240
&lrm;It wasn't easy
&lrm;but I'm glad I tried,

19:09.400 --> 19:12.120
&lrm;If I hadn't
&lrm;I'd never have known I could do it!

19:17.240 --> 19:18.960
&lrm;Where were you?

19:19.120 --> 19:21.800
&lrm;- Hiding under a rock?
&lrm;- Very funny.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.560
&lrm;I got... transformed into a knight.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.800
&lrm;So did I. What a 'knightmare".

19:27.240 --> 19:30.520
&lrm;Now this is all over,
&lrm;I want my personal items back.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.960
&lrm;[gasping]

19:32.120 --> 19:34.360
&lrm;What are you talking about?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.560
&lrm;Yes, please take it off.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.080
&lrm;Thank you.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.960
&lrm;Got an explanation, Chloe?

19:45.120 --> 19:49.760
<i>&lrm;I told you I never took her diary.</i>
<i>&lrm;I'm offended at you accusing me.</i>

19:50.040 --> 19:52.640
&lrm;Then how did you know
&lrm;my diary was in here?

19:52.920 --> 19:54.360
&lrm;[gasps]

19:54.520 --> 19:56.200
&lrm;Well... I...

19:56.360 --> 19:58.920
&lrm;Sabrina told me. It was all her idea.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.840
&lrm;So uncool.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.720
&lrm;Now we know nobody will vote for Chloe.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.000
&lrm;You're gonna be our new class rep.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.480
&lrm;Not so fast.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.240
&lrm;See? She's undependable.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.880
&lrm;She's already giving up.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.600
&lrm;No, I'm not. I want to be voted in fairly

20:14.760 --> 20:17.360
&lrm;not because
&lrm;you don't want to vote for Chloe

20:17.520 --> 20:19.120
&lrm;but because you believe in me.

20:19.520 --> 20:24.280
&lrm;I won't make promises I can't keep,
&lrm;I won't get you everything you want,

20:24.440 --> 20:27.200
&lrm;but I am resourceful,
&lrm;and I know how to prioritise.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.520
&lrm;I'm good at listening and multi-tasking.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.400
&lrm;Representing you all is what I believe in

20:32.560 --> 20:34.800
&lrm;and I believe in myself.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.160
&lrm;So vote for Marinette
&lrm;for class representative.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.520
&lrm;[cheering]

20:42.680 --> 20:45.280
&lrm;What are you doing?
&lrm;Are you out of your mind?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.400
&lrm;[groaning] What are you good for?

20:49.720 --> 20:53.320
&lrm;By majority vote,
&lrm;Marinette is the new class representative

20:53.480 --> 20:55.400
&lrm;and Alya will be her deputy.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.800
&lrm;You'll be able to do your blog
&lrm;and be deputy.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.200
&lrm;We can do anything
&lrm;if we put our minds to it.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.480
&lrm;I'm with you, girl.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.560
&lrm;[chuckling]

21:03.720 --> 21:05.440
&lrm;[happy music]
