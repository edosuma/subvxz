I'd successfully combined

08:43.857 --> 08:45.813
I mean, theoretically,
this formula is sound,

08:45.901 --> 08:50.270

a mutation because
something is missing.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.564
Something?
Some kind of catalyst

08:53.659 --> 08:56.617
that allows the proteins
from the serum
to bond with the enzymes

08:56.704 --> 08:58.490
produced by each
individual's adrenals.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.989
Then you'll just
have to keep looking.
It's not that simple.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.449
The key component
of this catalyst

09:03.544 --> 09:06.081
would be something
that couldn't be stored
or created synthetically.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.920

Meaning it would live
in a human host.

09:09.883 --> 09:14.843

isn't something, it's someone?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.138

20:04.788 --> 20:08.997
There was a wide
spot up in the road,
in the Berkshires.

20:09.084 --> 20:12.952
My father used to take
my brother and me fishing
there when we were kids.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.714
It was called Pinehearst.
Nathan, are you sure
you want to do this?

20:19.260 --> 20:24.050
If he's alive,
maybe there's a reason
he hasn't contacted you.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.676
I need to know the truth.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.928
Everything I've ever done
in my life has been
because of my father.

20:32.482 --> 20:36.020
I went to law school to be
like him, I married the girl
he wanted me to,

20:36.111 --> 20:39.274
I ran for office
because he couldn't.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.648
If he's alive,
I've got to see him.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.991
My God.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.882
Good to see you,
too, Nathan.
Come give your dad a hug.

Miss Strauss.
I must be.

what you've done
to this family?

What you've done to me?
Hindsight being 20-20,

21:38.798 --> 21:42.837
I should've told you
sooner what your role
was in all of this.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.254
My role?

21:49.392 --> 21:53.101
Would you excuse us, please?
My son and I
need to talk alone.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.603
Absolutely.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.986
Take a hard look at the last
couple of weeks of your life,

22:03.072 --> 22:06.155
and you will see
that role coming
into focus.

22:06.242 --> 22:11.077
The assassination,
Linderman,
the Senate seat,

22:11.748 --> 22:13.909
all part of your destiny.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.783
That was all you.

22:16.920 --> 22:21.414
You were born
with a talent, Nathan,
the talent to lead a nation.

22:22.592 --> 22:26.426
This is the same crap
Linderman spouted.
I'm not falling for it again.

22:28.181 --> 22:31.844
Because last time
it was New York
that was destroyed,

22:31.935 --> 22:34.017
and this time it'll be
the world, right?

22:34.103 --> 22:40.440
Look around you, it's already
happening, and I've got
the formula that will stop it.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.483
You're insane.

22:49.953 --> 22:55.289

that you have always
been my favorite son.

You're a monster like me.
No.

Your father made you this way,
just like my mother made me.

We were never good enough
for them, Elle. You never
meant to be this way.

Mom. Thank God
you're okay.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.702
Your father,
he's alive.
I know.

39:39.628 --> 39:41.084
I talked to him today.

39:44.132 --> 39:47.215
He's got the formula,
both halves.

39:48.262 --> 39:49.843
They were supposed to be
hidden away forever,

39:49.930 --> 39:54.048
but someone's stolen them
right out from underneath us.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.053
Peter and I have
both seen the future

39:56.144 --> 39:59.227
and, trust me,
it's not one that any
of you want to face.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.021
Make that three of us,
and she's right.

40:02.109 --> 40:06.569
Arthur's probably figured out
by now that there's
a third piece of the formula.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.065
It won't work without it.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.818
What kind of piece?
It's a catalyst.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.739
Hidden away
in the blood
of a human host.

40:14.830 --> 40:19.415
Kaito Nakamura was
the only one who knew
the identity of the host.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.163
And Kaito,
as we know,
is dead.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.753
So how do we
find the host?
We don't have to.

40:25.841 --> 40:28.002
We just have
to make sure
that he doesn't.

40:35.517 --> 40:38.099
When Sylar attacked me,
he saw something.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.807
He took off
the top of my head.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.774
He said I was different
from everyone else. Special.

40:52.534 --> 40:53.694
(SCOFFS)

40:53.785 --> 40:56.367
I didn't understand
what that meant
until today.

41:01.293 --> 41:02.874
I think
I'm the catalyst.

41:16.850 --> 41:22.061
MOH/NDER: It starts with light
and ends with light, and
in between there is darkness.

41:25.359 --> 41:27.645
Nothing there is
beyond hope,

41:27.736 --> 41:29.852
nothing that can be
sworn impossible,

41:31.073 --> 41:32.734
nothing left unimagined,

41:32.824 --> 41:37.568
since Zeus,
father of the Olympians,
made night from midday,

41:45.420 --> 41:47.581
hiding the light
of the shining sun,

41:47.673 --> 41:51.086
and raining dark fear
down upon men.

41:52.094 --> 41:53.425
It's coming.
