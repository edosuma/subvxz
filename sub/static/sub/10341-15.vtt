WEBVTT

02:41.995 --> 02:43.829
Would you know his full name?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.539
I barely knew the kid.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.416
Jim. Uh...

02:48.251 --> 02:50.961
- Jim.
- James.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.255
James Hurley.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.341
He said he was from Twin Peaks.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.844
He's a drifter.

02:59.012 --> 03:04.141
He was probably long gone by the time
Mr. Marsh pulled out of the driveway.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.101
Did he work here long?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.979
Mrs. Marsh hired him
to fix the Jaguar.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.564
Jaguar...

03:11.858 --> 03:16.945
J-A-G-W... A car.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.447
How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?

03:18.656 --> 03:22.618
Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down
near Wallies.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.370
I went in to use the phone.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.415
He offered to help.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.127
Okay, we'll check that. Thank you.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.345
And so we bid adieu
to James Hurley.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.847
Give it a rest.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.642
Careful, Evelyn.

03:46.809 --> 03:50.145
I'm not sure I can tolerate
a nervous co-conspirator.

03:50.313 --> 03:54.233
I just want it over with, all right?

03:55.026 --> 03:57.945
Anything you say, Mrs. Marsh.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.013
James, we can't get out of this
by ourselves.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.099
We're gonna need someone
to help us.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.518
I didn't do anything.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.813
Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh.
I'm being framed.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.773
Can I get you something,
Miss Hayward?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.067
No. No, thank you.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.783
Look, it doesn't make any difference.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.786
We can't wait for the cops
to catch us.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.206
- I think I should call Ed.
- No, no, don't.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.209
I gotta... My only chance
is to talk to Evelyn myself.

04:54.377 --> 04:58.505
If she told me that this was all a setup,
maybe she'll just tell the police that too.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.340
You're sure?

05:00.508 --> 05:02.134
Yeah.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.471
You wouldn't have a chance.
The cops will be waiting for you.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.598
We've gotta keep moving.

05:08.766 --> 05:11.351
She'd listen to me though.
I know she would.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.270
Would she?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.648
Why?

05:20.111 --> 05:22.404
I'm gonna go call Ed.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.364
Stay here.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.372
Hi, Ed? Hi, it's Donna.

05:32.582 --> 05:36.918
Listen, I don't have a lot of time,
but I think James is in trouble.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.046
Well, he's been working
for this woman.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.798
Uh, working on her car, um,

05:41.966 --> 05:44.718
and I think
there's been this accident and...

05:44.886 --> 05:47.596
Hi, how are you doing, Yvette?

05:47.764 --> 05:50.349
Listen, I heard about
your new boyfriend.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.894
Yeah, that's great, really.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.145
Good to hear it.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.647
So tell me about him.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.617
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Frank.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.621
What were you doing
at Shelly's house last night, Bobby?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.540
Shelly almost gets murdered and
you're worried about what I'm doing?

06:15.708 --> 06:16.750
What about Leostein?

06:16.918 --> 06:20.253
What were you doing
at Shelly's house?

06:21.422 --> 06:24.132
Look, here's the deal.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.969
Shelly and I are together, okay?

06:28.137 --> 06:31.014
We have been for a long time,
since before Laura died,

06:31.182 --> 06:34.309
before and after Leo
went into his drool mode.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.727
Bobby?

06:35.895 --> 06:39.022
Where were you
the night the mill burned?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.233
What's that got to do with this?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.527
Leo tried to kill you.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.696
- Maybe you shot him.
- No way.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.865
I went to Shelly's
the night the mill burned down,

06:49.033 --> 06:50.367
because I was worried about her.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.077
He was about to bury an ax
in my head

06:52.245 --> 06:54.121
when Hank Jennings shot him
through the window.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.832
- You sure it was Hank?
- Absolutely.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.167
What's Hank's connection with Leo?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.044
I don't know, man.
Why don't you tell me?

07:01.212 --> 07:05.215
Shelly, do you have any idea
where Leo might be now?

07:06.634 --> 07:07.884
No, I don't.

07:08.094 --> 07:12.180
I'll assign a couple of my deputies
to the house 24 hours a day.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.391
Hey, man,
I can take care of Shelly all right.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.226
You can just save the deputies.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.603
Bobby Briggs,

07:18.771 --> 07:19.855
button it.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.316
- You can go now.
- Okay.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.653
Shelly, don't worry, we're not
gonna let you out of our sight.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.697
- Thank you.
- Come on, Shelly.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.741
I feel so much safer,
don't you, Shelly?

07:31.909 --> 07:33.326
Bobby.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.128
Get a life, punk.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.588
Gentlemen.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.215
Another trip on the "Seattle
to Twin Peaks" shuttle.

07:47.383 --> 07:48.717
How are you?

07:48.885 --> 07:51.178
- Looking good, Harry.
- Yeah.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.305
- Albert.
- Coop.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.933
- Gentlemen.
- What have you got?

07:57.101 --> 07:59.144
My invite back to Twin Peaks.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.564
Windom Earle.
Direct orders from Gordon Cole.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.357
As he so succinctly put it:

08:04.567 --> 08:07.152
"I'm worried about Coop."

08:13.576 --> 08:18.205
Springfield, Kansas City,
Lawton, Dallas, Jackson.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.040
Earle's been sending
gift-wrapped packages

08:20.208 --> 08:23.585
to police departments
and major law enforcement agencies.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.338
Each looks like a mail bomb,
but they turn out to be harmless.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.549
The deliveries were paid for by a phony
credit card signed Windom Earle.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.510
What's in the boxes?

08:31.677 --> 08:34.387
One article of clothing in each.

08:35.765 --> 08:41.436
One, a white veil, two, a garter,
three, a pair of white slippers,

08:41.604 --> 08:46.149
four, a pearl necklace,
and finally, a wedding dress.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.610
Caroline's.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.489
He's got DEA and FBI,
not to mention Mississippi, Oklahoma

08:52.657 --> 08:54.991
and Illinois State patrols
looking for him.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.452
Everyone's invited to the party.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.872
But my guess is, he won't dance
with anyone but you, Coop.

09:04.919 --> 09:09.589
The vagrant from the office died
from a knife wound severing the aorta.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.384
This guy's finger is pointed
directly at this chess piece.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.053
How did Earle manage that
with the rigor mortis?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.930
Well, rigor mortis goes
from head to toe.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.891
But after two days,
it leaves the body from toe to head.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.602
So he waited for it to leave
the arms and the fingers

09:22.770 --> 09:25.897
so they could be maneuvered
onto the chess board.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.651
And then he played Zeus
at the power station.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.028
- What was found?
- This map.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.698
Taped to the bottom of a table.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.825
Good work, Albert.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.587
He's making his move.
Most definitely.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.505
Yeah.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.095
Oh, Coop, uh, about the uniform.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.555
Yes, Albert?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.890
Replacing the quiet elegance
of the dark suit and tie

10:01.058 --> 10:04.102
with the casual indifference
of these muted earth tones

10:04.270 --> 10:08.398
is a form of fashion suicide,
but, uh, call me crazy.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.484
- On you, it works.
- Heh.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.695
Thank you, Albert.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.025
Ah, you're awake then.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.320
Heh. I trust you've slept well?

10:55.488 --> 11:00.158
While you've slept,
I've learned all about you.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.286
Leo Johnson.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.790
The police would like to see you
as soon as possible.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.959
Now, let me see.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.213
Ah! Drug trafficking.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.716
Arson. Ooh, ha, ha.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.260
Attempted murder.

11:19.428 --> 11:24.349
Domestic violence.
Now I am partial to that.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.896
Well, Leo, I've cleansed your wounds.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.189
You're on the mend.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.776
I've removed the proverbial thorn
from your paw.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.446
Leo. Leo the lion.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.075
Now...

11:42.243 --> 11:44.953
I want you to help me.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.163
And obey me.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.666
Will you do that? Hmm?

11:50.960 --> 11:55.296
Did you know that,
in the 13th century in Japan,

11:55.464 --> 11:58.299
the samurai were stripped
of their weaponry.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.679
But they discovered that the aged
and treated bamboo

12:02.847 --> 12:07.851
of their shakuhachi flute
made an excellent cudgel.

12:10.855 --> 12:15.608
This flute
is truly an instrument of pleasure.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.569
Don't you think?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.820
Meow.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.535
I wanted to save this necklace
for an occasion,

12:25.745 --> 12:28.079
but you've ruined it.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.248
Ha, ha. Meow.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.378
Now...

12:35.546 --> 12:37.630
Come over here.

12:37.798 --> 12:42.135
Mm. I've made you some gruel.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.646
Come on, Leo, eat your gruel.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.107
Yum, yum. Mm, heh.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.870
It's been 20 years, babe.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.290
One day we're talking
about a graduation party

13:12.458 --> 13:14.918
and the next day we're here.

13:16.170 --> 13:20.590
And in between
nothing but a world of hurt.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.724
I tried not to think about it.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.852
I just spent
more and more time at the diner,

13:33.020 --> 13:35.855
trying to make the place work.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.483
Because I had nothing else.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.362
We were open every day,

13:43.239 --> 13:46.199
so I wouldn't have to have
another life.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.953
No birthdays,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.247
no Fourth of July,

13:53.582 --> 13:55.583
no Christmas.

13:57.753 --> 14:04.676
Well, I turned all my Christmases
into a week full of Mondays.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.428
When that didn't work,

14:07.596 --> 14:12.517
I thought about all the presents
I never bought you.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.894
Never got to give you.

14:17.898 --> 14:21.109
I bought you a present
last Christmas.

14:21.277 --> 14:26.239
It was a turquoise and onyx bolo tie.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.618
I walked over to your house
to give it to you,

14:33.664 --> 14:35.498
but I couldn't go in.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.584
I just waited.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.086
I could see you through the window.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.382
I don't know why I couldn't go in.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.556
I'm sorry I didn't.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.518
All that time,

14:57.354 --> 14:59.981
you should have been in my home.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.736
In my bed.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.114
It's about the future now, Ed.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.867
And what we're gonna do about it.

15:13.329 --> 15:17.123
I want you to come tonight
after I close the diner.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.292
Take me home.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.919
You're right.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.379
It's all ahead of us.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.549
Plenty of time.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.552
Eddie?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.763
- Eddie?
- No, no, no.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.390
I may as well talk to her now.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.114
Hello, Nadine.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.327
I got all the way
to the district finals at Knife River,

15:54.495 --> 15:59.624
only to find out
the airplane slam is illegal.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.795
I was disqualified.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.173
Second place, what a drag.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.593
Oh, boy, what a tough break, huh?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.221
Hello, Nadine.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.893
I owe you an apology, Norma.

16:19.061 --> 16:23.231
I mean, I really pounded Hank
and I am sorry.

16:24.274 --> 16:27.568
But I thought he was gonna do
something to Eddie.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.947
And I sort of got mad.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.658
Thank you.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.744
Eh.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.127
Know what?

16:45.212 --> 16:46.754
I know about you guys.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.674
It's really, really okay.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.428
Because I don't have to feel so guilty
about me and Mike.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.887
You and Mike?

16:55.097 --> 16:57.724
I don't wanna get into it,
but I have to tell you,

16:57.891 --> 17:01.227
it is really, really serious.

17:01.437 --> 17:05.690
So you guys can go ahead
and do whatever you want.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.944
I am completely cool
about all of this.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.239
Really.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.510
Josie...

17:35.262 --> 17:37.138
This is it.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.976
The Seattle police want answers
and I have to tell them something.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.605
They know you were connected
with Jonathan.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.232
How did he die?

17:48.442 --> 17:50.818
He was shot three times
in the back of the head.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.572
Josie...

17:55.574 --> 17:57.950
If you were ever gonna tell the truth,

18:00.788 --> 18:04.874
now would be an ideal time.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.502
Think I'll get another cup of joe.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.720
Ah.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.185
Is that you, Pete?

18:24.394 --> 18:27.730
- Yeah. Cooper?
- Yeah.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.818
I get over to the Clean and Save

18:31.985 --> 18:35.822
and Jeanie Pombelek
is working the counter.

18:35.989 --> 18:39.325
She does not speak
one word of English.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.411
Nada, zip.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.705
She's from Budapest.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.707
We just stood there
and looked at each other

18:46.875 --> 18:49.085
like we were made of wood.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.629
- Who does all this belong to, Pete?
- Oh...

18:53.257 --> 18:56.092
Catherine's been running her
into the ground.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.052
- Need a hand?
- So I offered to stop

18:58.220 --> 19:02.723
by the dry cleaners
and pick up Josie's stuff.

19:02.891 --> 19:07.645
You know, the only words I know
in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.856
It took me 20 minutes
to get this stuff.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.693
Let me get that. Give me a hand.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.197
Hello.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.074
Just hold a minute.

19:20.242 --> 19:24.787
- It's for Josie. Is she here?
- She's in the other room, Pete.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.478
- Hello.
- Josie.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.397
It's Thomas.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.609
I'm so glad I've found you.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.945
I was wondering
if we could get together.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.783
Did you hear about
what happened to Jonathan?

20:03.702 --> 20:07.038
Dreadful.

20:07.497 --> 20:11.209
Welcome to Twin Peaks,
Mr. Eckhardt.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.385
She's run back to Catherine Martell.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.387
I'm so disappointed.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.315
So I asked Stonewall Jackson
what he would like to do

20:34.483 --> 20:36.484
after we run the Yankees
up to Canada.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.738
He said: "Follow them.
I wanna be the Duke of Montréal."

20:43.242 --> 20:45.743
Oh, that Stonewall.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.078
I once asked him

20:47.746 --> 20:50.039
what he thought
I should do with Lincoln.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.126
And he says, "Old Honest Abe
is about as useful to you

20:54.294 --> 20:57.922
as a spittoon cleaner
in a whorehouse."

21:02.928 --> 21:05.471
Whoa! Whoa, traveler. Whoa!

21:05.639 --> 21:07.348
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?

21:07.516 --> 21:11.143
Ah, letting him out to mingle with the
public doesn't seem to have helped.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.688
Well, you have to admit,
he's kind of fun this way.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.899
What's the matter with you?
That's my father, your brother.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.777
We can't leave him like this.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.737
Well, now, Audrey, honey, now.

21:21.905 --> 21:27.118
There are some advantages
to leaving him, click, click, insane.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.788
told me that every man,
woman and child...

21:30.956 --> 21:33.541
Now, Audrey,
you know I was upset too,

21:33.709 --> 21:37.336
but there's some projects,
both domestic and international,

21:37.504 --> 21:39.046
that I'd might get a chance
to develop.

21:39.214 --> 21:43.634
I mean, one man's crisis
is another man's opportunity.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.636
Let me tell you something,
Uncle Jerry.

21:45.804 --> 21:50.641
We leave him the way he is,
and I become executor of the estate.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.311
Audrey, it's a little more complicated
than that, sweetheart.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.439
No, it isn't.
I've examined his will, Jerry.

21:56.606 --> 22:01.152
If my father becomes incapacitated,
it all goes to me when I'm old enough.

22:01.320 --> 22:06.365
And I am old enough, Jer,
and he is incapacitated.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.868
I have my way either way.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.413
When the only project
you'll be developing

22:12.581 --> 22:16.625
is selling baseboard heaters
at the local Cash 'n' Carry.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.672
What's happened to the man
is a tragedy.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.383
It is a tragedy, Jer.

22:29.973 --> 22:33.434
Dr. Jacoby,
I want you to bring my father back.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.228
- To the office?
- Parade, rest!

22:36.396 --> 22:38.356
To the real world.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.195
I think it's time we implement
the Appomattox scenario.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.782
Hey, sorry I'm late. A couple of bikers
tried to take this jacket.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.368
But old Stonewall's
gone from me now,

22:50.577 --> 22:53.662
cut down in a hail of Yankee lead.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.706
He died alone,

22:55.874 --> 22:58.376
without my comfort.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.585
Laddy.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.380
Come here.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.966
You know what I wanna hear.
Troops, about face.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.511
"Dixie." "Dixie"!

23:08.678 --> 23:10.805
Forward, march.

23:10.972 --> 23:16.018
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton

23:16.186 --> 23:19.230
Old times there were not forgotten

23:19.398 --> 23:26.112
Look away, look away, look away
Dixie land

23:26.279 --> 23:27.405
Oh, I wish...

23:45.465 --> 23:47.508
Mrs. Marsh?

23:48.176 --> 23:51.178
I'm Donna, James' friend.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.267
I remember you.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.269
Get the lady here a drink.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.938
With a little umbrella in it.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.691
Go on, dear, sit down, it's all right.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.777
- Why are you doing this to James?
- Why not?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.654
Because he's a good person.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.032
He was good at two things:

24:12.200 --> 24:14.201
The car and me.

24:14.870 --> 24:18.080
You don't get it, do you?
I'm talking about our lives.

24:18.248 --> 24:24.336
Life. Life will be rosy if you can
just get out of one silly little jam.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.088
Maybe.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.299
Maybe not.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.758
Talk to me in a couple of years

24:29.926 --> 24:32.344
when your whole life
has turned to crap.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.181
You really like to make everything
sound pointless and stupid.

24:35.390 --> 24:39.435
If there was a reason to climb out
of this primeval swill,

24:39.644 --> 24:42.146
believe me, dear, I'd know it.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.689
Would you, really?

24:43.857 --> 24:48.402
Oh, here we are.
The car's waiting, Mrs. Marsh.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.279
Get in it.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.706
I'm sorry about your friend, honey.
There's nothing you can do.

25:00.874 --> 25:04.376
So why don't you trundle along
to your little town,

25:04.544 --> 25:09.381
safe in the knowledge that,
if I ever see you here again,

25:10.091 --> 25:12.051
I'll kill you.

25:14.721 --> 25:18.307
Don't do this to him, please!

25:18.475 --> 25:20.351
Please.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.117
Coop, take a look at this.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.704
Vicuña thread sample
taken from Josie's coat.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.499
Traces found on the floor
outside your room.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.501
They're from the same coat?

25:45.669 --> 25:48.546
Let me put it to you this way,
either Josie Packard pulled the trigger,

25:48.713 --> 25:50.881
or she's loaning her winter wear
to the wrong people.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.967
- It's a perfect match.
- What about the gloves?

25:53.134 --> 25:55.719
Checking for powder burns.
I'll have the results in the morning.

25:55.887 --> 25:56.929
From the Seattle Homicide?

25:57.138 --> 25:59.390
Locals are looking
for a beautiful Asian woman,

25:59.599 --> 26:02.810
late 20s, in connection with the murder
of one Jonathan Kumagai.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.104
He has an Interpol sheet
as long as your arm

26:05.313 --> 26:07.690
and three holes
in the back of his head.

26:07.857 --> 26:11.443
I'm betting the bullets will match
the slugs we took from your vest.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.531
I hope it's not Josie,
for Harry's sake.

26:16.616 --> 26:20.411
Coop, as you know, Truman and I
have had our differences in the past.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.872
But the big lug's got his heart
in the right place, if nothing else.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.167
And I'm not above feeling a little
sympathy for the stalwart and the dull.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.211
- What's you point, Albert?
- Speaking frankly?

26:29.379 --> 26:31.297
Feel free.

26:31.464 --> 26:34.717
Our sheriff's got a serious problem
with his girlfriend.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.141
Albert,

26:42.309 --> 26:45.144
not one word until we're certain.

26:45.937 --> 26:46.979
Ah.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.192
Coop.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.195
Our John Doe's got a name:

26:55.363 --> 26:59.158
Erik Powell. Transient.
Former merchant marine by his prints.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.951
Powell?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.662
Yeah, ring a bell?

27:04.706 --> 27:07.583
Powell was Caroline's
maiden name.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.254
Do you think
this Powell is a relative?

27:12.422 --> 27:16.050
No. Earle's playing
the game according to his own rules.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.886
Every move he makes
sends a message.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.554
The fact that he chose
the name Powell

27:20.722 --> 27:23.265
tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing
that went on between us.

27:23.683 --> 27:27.394
So whenever he takes a piece
from the board...

27:27.604 --> 27:29.938
Someone dies.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.859
I never beat him, Harry.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.445
Coop, if you've got a need
for a chess expert,

27:36.613 --> 27:38.739
we've got one of the best
right here in town.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.534
Checkmate.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.746
Checkmate.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.417
And mate.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.048
Frankly, I am impressed.

27:56.800 --> 28:01.053
I owe it all
to the great José Raúl Capablanca.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.514
Now, if there's chess boards
in heaven,

28:03.723 --> 28:06.058
José's sitting next to the Lord.

28:06.226 --> 28:09.353
- Doc?
- The mind reels.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.772
- One of these days.
- Ha, ha.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.358
Pete, I need your help.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.860
I'm playing a chess match
of considerable importance.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.278
I can't say any more than that.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.365
Suffice to say,
I'd like to stalemate the game,

28:21.574 --> 28:25.994
losing as few pieces as possible.
None, if that can be arranged.

28:26.162 --> 28:30.958
Well, Agent Cooper,
I'd be proud to serve.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.001
Thanks, Pete.

28:33.169 --> 28:37.297
Great players are either far or few.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.812
- Hi.
- Shelly.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.189
I'm sorry about what happened.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.150
Are you okay?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.027
Not really.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.238
I wanted to come right over,

29:01.406 --> 29:04.700
but with Hank gone,
it's been a madhouse here.

29:05.535 --> 29:09.413
You, um, don't need any help,
do you?

29:10.248 --> 29:13.375
Um, I... I'd...

29:14.419 --> 29:16.128
I'd feel safer, Norma.

29:16.796 --> 29:19.089
Are you kidding?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.425
It hasn't been the same without you.

29:21.634 --> 29:23.677
When can you start?

29:25.221 --> 29:30.100
- Um, now?
- Great. Welcome back.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.269
Thank you.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.479
Norma?

29:33.688 --> 29:34.938
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hi.

29:35.106 --> 29:39.109
Excuse me.
Uh, I need to talk to you for a minute.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.535
There's something you should know.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.663
Hank's nearly ready
to leave the hospital.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.458
What about his parole violations?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.877
Harry, this time
I don't want him back.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.964
Don't worry. He won't be back.
Hank's going to jail.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.550
We're charging him with
the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.928
Add that to breaking parole,

30:06.095 --> 30:09.097
Hank's going away for a long time.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.684
Good.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.042
Mr. Eckhardt, welcome.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.295
Josie, help our guest with his coat.

30:47.262 --> 30:51.598
I must confess I received
your invitation with some surprise.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.560
Well, word travels fast
in Twin Peaks.

30:54.727 --> 30:58.522
I thought it was fitting that I dined
with my late brother's business rival.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.148
Some wine, Josie.

31:00.316 --> 31:02.776
Your brother was not
always my rival. We were friends.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.445
- But your friendship soured.
- Sadly.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.866
Men of business frequently find
their personal lives disrupted

31:09.033 --> 31:11.034
by the larger portraits they paint.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.413
You consider yourself an artist?
The wine, Josie.

31:14.581 --> 31:18.000
Of a sort. Your brother was as well.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.294
I wonder, Mr. Eckhardt.

31:20.461 --> 31:24.172
When you had him killed,
was it for art or money?

31:24.340 --> 31:27.843
- Don't stand there, Josie, pour.
- Call me Thomas. Your brother did.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.096
Thomas. We'll have
our hors d'oeuvres now, Josie.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.348
One does not kill for art or money.

31:33.516 --> 31:37.060
They are commodities easily lost
and just as easily gained.

31:37.228 --> 31:43.609
However, one, rather I,
might find reason to kill for love.

31:43.776 --> 31:47.654
- Did you love her that much?
- Yes.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.449
Josie has the most
incredible hands.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.659
Every finger a thing of beauty.

31:52.827 --> 31:54.745
I remember.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.628
I wonder,
what shall we do about her?

32:02.795 --> 32:06.381
It would be a shame
if you left empty-handed.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.928
Of course,
I'll miss her cheery disposition.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.513
We've become the best of friends.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.599
Two girls chatting over tea.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.393
Perhaps you should purchase
an animal of some kind.

32:18.561 --> 32:19.895
A cat or a dog.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.357
If I give her to you,
what will you give me in return?

32:23.566 --> 32:27.569
How can I place a value
on something so precious?

32:30.198 --> 32:33.951
But you will try?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.453
Yes.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.957
Josie.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.710
Thomas and I
will have our main course now.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.285
Why did you do it?

33:22.166 --> 33:24.292
You know I've been going through it.

33:24.460 --> 33:27.212
- I can't figure it out.
- James, you're not safe here.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.007
- If Malcolm finds you...
- Is it the money?

33:30.174 --> 33:32.634
Is that it? No. No, I got it.

33:32.802 --> 33:37.222
It was Malcolm. Oh, yeah.
He made you do it. Right?

33:37.390 --> 33:41.184
You better tell me a story, Evelyn.
Because I'm all mixed up.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.186
I just wanna know
why you would do this to me.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.230
James.

33:46.357 --> 33:51.987
What did you expect? An apology?
A hidden heart of gold?

33:52.155 --> 33:54.906
I did it all, James. I did everything.

33:55.074 --> 33:59.202
I found you, I lured you in
and I kept you here,

33:59.370 --> 34:03.540
while Malcolm planned
a nice, neat little frame.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.461
- Why?
- For the money.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.337
Out of fear.

34:09.505 --> 34:12.382
Because I wanted to do it.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.094
It's not exactly what you wanted
to hear, is it, James?

34:16.262 --> 34:19.056
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

34:20.892 --> 34:25.812
James, you're good
and you're honest.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.106
I'm not.

34:28.274 --> 34:29.983
But that doesn't mean
there weren't moments

34:30.151 --> 34:32.736
when I truly wanted you here.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.906
Not for Malcolm,

34:36.074 --> 34:39.493
or for the money, but for me.

34:40.203 --> 34:43.705
For the good and honest way
that you taste.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.461
I like how you taste too.

34:53.758 --> 34:58.303
Malcolm, what did you do?
James, James. You hurt him.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.852
He broke into the house,

35:06.020 --> 35:09.064
he was angry, he was crazy.

35:09.232 --> 35:14.486
He killed Jeffrey
and he came back to kill you.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.489
You poor, defenseless little widow.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.200
But you were ready for him, Evelyn.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.536
You got your gun,

35:22.703 --> 35:25.288
and you shot James.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.083
You shot him until he was dead.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.954
- General Lee.
- Whoa.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.919
Welcome to our humble horse...
Home, General Lee.

36:13.087 --> 36:16.756
- Thank you. And you are?
- Scarlett McLean.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.758
And this is my father...

36:18.968 --> 36:21.720
- This is my father.
- Oh.

36:23.389 --> 36:26.308
Wilmer McLean at your service.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.519
I'm indeed honored to be making
your extremely sociable acquaintance.

36:29.687 --> 36:33.356
And why are you armed
with my sword, sir?

36:33.524 --> 36:35.817
I like your sword, sire.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.613
- Thank you, Daddy. Thank you.
- Where is General Grant?

36:39.822 --> 36:42.282
General Grant's a-coming, sire,
I know it.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.284
Excuse us.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.504
General Grant.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.340
General Lee.

36:58.507 --> 37:02.052
Sir, we met during the Mexican War.
Do you remember?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.554
I have come to surrender the North.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.932
The Mexican War, sir.
Do you remember?

37:07.099 --> 37:10.060
JACOBY; Oh, yes, yes.
It was a good war, as I remember.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.730
Nonsense.
All wars are nothing but madness.

37:13.898 --> 37:18.026
Disguised as the patriotic ventures
of politicians,

37:18.194 --> 37:21.655
too old and too cowardly
to participate in them.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.699
- No, no, sir, I have no love for war.
- Me neither.

37:24.867 --> 37:27.244
- And even less for politicians.
- Hey, amen.

37:27.411 --> 37:31.039
But, as for the men who fight them,

37:31.207 --> 37:36.169
they have my eternal respect
and sympathy.

37:37.713 --> 37:41.424
All right, general,
enough of this fruitless conversation.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.885
My terms:

37:44.053 --> 37:47.180
Federal officers
may keep their sidearms

37:47.348 --> 37:50.100
and other general possessions.

37:50.309 --> 37:54.187
Officers and men claiming to own
their own horses may keep them too.

37:54.355 --> 37:59.276
And, uh, officers and men will be
allowed to return to their home,

37:59.443 --> 38:02.946
not to be disturbed
by the Confederate States' authorities.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.533
- I surrender.
- Of course you do.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.910
The articles.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.291
- Here, sire, the articles.
- Sir.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.751
The articles, sir.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.839
- You will sign, General Grant.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

38:21.007 --> 38:25.385
And may I add that, that you've been
a valiant opponent of fine character.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.179
I thought the North won
the Civil War?

38:45.448 --> 38:46.948
Ben?

38:48.409 --> 38:50.076
Ben.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.411
Daddy.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.334
- Ben? Ben?
- Daddy?

38:57.501 --> 38:59.210
Hey, give him some room.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.171
Where am I?

39:01.380 --> 39:04.341
- Where am I?
- Twin Peaks, Ben.

39:05.885 --> 39:10.555
Oh. I had the strangest dream.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.098
Heh.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.643
And you were there.

39:15.853 --> 39:19.230
And you, and you.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.816
It was incredible.

39:21.984 --> 39:24.277
It was a war.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.863
And I was General...

39:27.031 --> 39:30.533
General Robert E. Lee.

39:31.285 --> 39:36.081
And somehow,
in spite of incredible odds,

39:37.124 --> 39:38.208
I won.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.335
Now you're home, Daddy.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.295
Yes.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.508
- I'm home.
- Attaboy, Ben. Ha, ha.

39:46.675 --> 39:50.512
How do you feel?
Any, any aftereffects? Dizziness?

39:52.014 --> 39:54.391
I feel terrific.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.728
- I feel, uh...
- Yes?

39:58.938 --> 40:02.482
- What is it, Daddy?
- What are you doing in those clothes?

40:08.239 --> 40:09.823
Attaboy, Ben.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.200
What? What's the joke?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.621
Attaboy, Ben.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.422
Work slowly.

40:25.631 --> 40:28.007
And with care.

40:28.217 --> 40:34.472
Everything must be written
with a steady, uncompromising hand.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.769
No, no, no.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.688
Terrible.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.733
Erase.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.407
Now...

40:52.575 --> 40:54.492
Try again.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.290
Concentrate.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.710
Leo, for heaven's sake.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.673
Here. Shh, shh, shh.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.009
Let me show you.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.760
Like this:

41:13.471 --> 41:15.638
There you go.

41:15.806 --> 41:18.433
Much better.

41:19.935 --> 41:23.271
I am proud of you, Leo.

41:34.492 --> 41:39.913
- Windom Earle?
- Yes.

41:40.122 --> 41:41.915
Windom.

41:42.082 --> 41:43.416
Heh.

41:44.543 --> 41:48.338
Pretty words for pretty girls.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.341
Which one shall be my queen?

41:52.259 --> 41:53.885
Queen?

41:57.890 --> 42:01.768
No. No.

42:01.977 --> 42:03.311
No.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.356
Lick.

42:18.827 --> 42:21.162
The story rings a little truer
with your fingerprints on...

42:21.330 --> 42:22.413
No, Malcolm, I can't.

42:22.581 --> 42:25.083
Just your prints.
Leave the rest to me.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.585
I'll do my best to imitate
the actions of a hysteric.

42:27.753 --> 42:29.671
Five shots, tightly grouped,

42:29.838 --> 42:32.715
as though the gun went off
in your hand.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.926
- Repeatedly.
- No!

42:35.135 --> 42:39.722
No! No! James, James, James.

42:39.890 --> 42:43.309
- Don't hurt him any more, please.
- Give me the gun.

42:43.477 --> 42:45.812
I've called the cops.
They're on their way, it won't work.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.772
- Malcolm.
- She's lying. Give me the gun.

42:47.940 --> 42:51.776
Evelyn,
please don't let him die, please.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.445
- Please.
- Evelyn.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.532
Give me the gun, Evelyn.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.993
- Evelyn, give me the gun.
- No.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.745
- Evelyn, give me the gun.
- No.

43:03.163 --> 43:06.040
Evelyn. Evelyn.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.918
I can't do this, Malcolm.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.379
Then I will.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.803
No.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.031
He was angry,

43:38.240 --> 43:39.907
he was crazy.

43:40.075 --> 43:44.787
He killed Jeffrey,
came back to kill me.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.206
I was ready, though.

43:47.958 --> 43:51.878
I got my gun and I shot him.

43:52.046 --> 43:55.965
I shot him till he was dead.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.329
Caroline.

44:35.422 --> 44:38.675
For Miss Audrey Horne, please.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.594
Owls?

45:24.471 --> 45:26.639
Breathtaking, wasn't she?

45:26.807 --> 45:30.476
A truly beautiful woman, Caroline.

45:30.644 --> 45:32.061
Funny, isn't it?

45:32.229 --> 45:33.771
After all this time,

45:34.356 --> 45:37.817
after all that happened
in Pittsburgh,

45:37.985 --> 45:40.862
I still love her.

45:41.029 --> 45:44.073
And I know that you do too.

45:44.241 --> 45:48.327
Now, Dale, listen carefully.

45:48.495 --> 46:46.844
It's your move.
