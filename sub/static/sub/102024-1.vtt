02:03.433 --> 02:04.262
- Yep.

02:05.849 --> 02:07.644
Any day between 11 and six.

02:09.646 --> 02:11.200
Nope, you don't need
an appointment.

02:16.515 --> 02:18.310
Right, every day.

02:18.345 --> 02:20.209
11 until six o'clock.

02:23.073 --> 02:26.698
Yep, we're open on Sundays too,

02:39.124 --> 02:41.678
Yeah, we're open

Well, if you just come
to the building,

02:45.026 --> 02:47.581
we'll be happy to show you,
you know, when we have one.

Hello?

[phone beeping]

03:10.535 --> 03:11.329
Yes, Ginny.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.158
- Hi.

03:14.021 --> 03:15.298
- Hi.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.093
- What are you doing?

03:17.127 --> 03:18.888
- Just living the dream.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.236
- Are you busy?

03:22.271 --> 03:23.962
- Not any more than usual.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.722
- If you're busy, I
can come back.

03:25.757 --> 03:26.930
- Stop.

03:26.965 --> 03:27.966
- You stop [hisses].

03:32.522 --> 03:33.627
How is your day going?

03:35.732 --> 03:39.702
- It's just another beautiful,
sunny California day, Ginny.

03:39.736 --> 03:40.565
- Cool.

03:41.669 --> 03:42.498
Cool.

03:45.294 --> 03:46.122
Cool.

03:52.956 --> 03:53.785
- So?

03:54.717 --> 03:55.545
What's up?

03:57.996 --> 04:00.447
- Oh, I'm so late. I
gotta go walk the dog.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.657
- You're supposed to be
walking the dog right now?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.866
- Yeah, if I'm not at Karen's

04:05.900 --> 04:08.213
at exactly one,
Snickers pees inside.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.183
- It's 10 after one.

04:14.909 --> 04:17.740
- I know, I'm so late.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.328
- So do you think Snickers
is peeing right now,

04:19.362 --> 04:21.295
or is the one time
that he holds it?

04:21.330 --> 04:22.158
- She?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.919
- Sorry, she.

04:39.175 --> 04:40.003
Good talk.

05:05.822 --> 05:06.651
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:06.685 --> 05:08.169
- I'm the on-site manager, Lisa.

05:08.204 --> 05:09.239
- Claire.

05:09.274 --> 05:13.174
This is my husband, Will.

05:13.209 --> 05:14.244
- Hi, Lisa.

05:14.279 --> 05:15.073
- Hi.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.178
- We're here to see
the one-bedroom.

05:17.213 --> 05:20.389
- We actually don't have any
one-bedrooms to show right now.

05:20.423 --> 05:23.081
- Oh, it said online
that you did.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.980
- Yeah, sorry, sometimes they
forget to pull the old ads.

05:27.534 --> 05:28.949
We're remodeling some units,
though.

05:28.983 --> 05:31.261
We should have one
available by the first.

05:31.296 --> 05:33.643
- You don't have anything
you can show us today.

05:33.678 --> 05:36.784
- We're only in town from
Texas for the weekend,

05:36.819 --> 05:38.372
and so we're hoping to
get something locked down

05:38.407 --> 05:41.030
for his work ... it
starts on the fourth.

05:41.064 --> 05:44.654
- Well we definitely will have
something available by then.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.622
- Okay, how much?

05:46.656 --> 05:48.658
- The one-bedrooms are
usually 1,895.

05:50.936 --> 05:52.904
- That's within our price range.

05:57.046 --> 05:58.254
- Moving's the worst.

05:59.462 --> 06:00.256
- Yeah.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.084
- Yeah.

06:01.119 --> 06:01.947
- It's a nightmare.

06:03.259 --> 06:04.812
- You know what? Let me
just give you a card.

06:04.847 --> 06:06.158
And that way, if you
don't find anything,

06:06.193 --> 06:07.505
you can always call us back.

06:07.539 --> 06:08.747
- Okay, thanks.

06:08.782 --> 06:09.610
- Yeah.

06:13.614 --> 06:14.408
Have a seat.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.104
What kinda work do you do?

06:21.139 --> 06:22.623
- Systems analyst.

06:22.658 --> 06:24.556
- His office is just down
the street from here.

06:24.591 --> 06:27.076
And we were hoping to get
somewhere close

06:27.110 --> 06:29.112
because of traffic.

06:29.147 --> 06:30.182
We only have one car.

06:31.218 --> 06:34.394
Anywhere close or decent
is so expensive.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.464
- That's LA for you.

06:36.637 --> 06:39.260
What about you, Claire?
What kinda work do you do?

06:39.295 --> 06:40.676
- I'm an actress [chuckles].

06:41.642 --> 06:43.644
I know it's cliche, but,

06:43.679 --> 06:46.785
small town girl coming
to LA to make it big.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.788
- Well if you're a cliche then
I'm an absolute stereotype.

06:52.929 --> 06:54.759
I'm guilty of the same thing.

06:54.793 --> 06:56.795
Hence the job
peddling apartments.

06:58.452 --> 07:01.110
- Is it really as
difficult as everyone says?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.215
- What?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.044
You've heard that?

07:04.078 --> 07:05.286
No no no, it's super easy.

07:05.321 --> 07:08.220
I just, I love doing this
instead of spending my millions.

07:08.255 --> 07:10.222
[laughing]

07:10.257 --> 07:13.018
No, you know I've done a
few small things.

07:13.053 --> 07:15.331
I have a manager and stuff, but

07:15.365 --> 07:16.815
it's work.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.852
But, you know, if you have
a good support network

07:18.886 --> 07:21.613
and a little bit of
talent, it's not that bad.

07:22.787 --> 07:24.064
- See, honey?

07:24.098 --> 07:25.168
It's easy.

07:25.203 --> 07:27.481
You have a little bit of
talent, and I support you.

07:28.586 --> 07:31.381
She's my retirement plan,
so don't discourage her.

07:31.416 --> 07:32.935
- Your secret's safe with me.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.871
All right, yeah, so here's
my information.

07:37.905 --> 07:40.460
Like I said, we're definitely
gonna have something available

07:40.494 --> 07:41.702
by the time you're
looking to move.

07:41.737 --> 07:44.464
And no BS, they're actually
really nice one-bedrooms.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.983
I kinda lucked into this gig
when we first moved here,

07:47.018 --> 07:50.400
but even if I didn't get free
rent, I would still live here.

07:50.435 --> 07:52.161
- You get free rent?

07:52.195 --> 07:55.026
Wow, that must be so
perfect for your acting.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.062
- I'm not gonna lie.
It's a pretty sweet deal.

07:58.616 --> 07:59.409
- [Will] All right,
we're gonna take a look

07:59.444 --> 08:00.825
at some other places.

08:00.859 --> 08:02.620
If we don't find anything,
we'll give you a call.

08:02.654 --> 08:03.793
- Great.

08:03.828 --> 08:04.967
- Thanks.

08:05.001 --> 08:06.002
- Oh, you know what?

08:06.037 --> 08:08.177
Let me just get you
some applications.

08:08.211 --> 08:10.317
That way, if you get home
and you decide that you're

08:10.351 --> 08:12.353
interested here, we can
always just do it by fax

08:12.388 --> 08:14.494
and that way you're
locked in, ready to move.

08:19.982 --> 08:22.432
[soft music]

08:24.952 --> 08:26.540
They're pretty self-explanatory.

08:27.403 --> 08:28.542
- Thank you.
- Sure.

08:28.577 --> 08:29.750
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

08:29.785 --> 08:31.096
- Good luck in your search.

08:57.122 --> 08:58.227
Lisa is sad.

09:06.235 --> 09:08.755
Lisa is sad.

09:08.789 --> 09:09.687
Lisa is sad.

Lisa is sad.

10:05.087 --> 10:05.915
Where did you go?

10:07.227 --> 10:08.746
Where did you fucking go?

10:10.955 --> 10:12.508
You could have stayed.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.061
You should have stayed.

10:16.788 --> 10:18.687
But you don't have the courage,
do you?

10:21.862 --> 10:25.348
You fucking piece of shit,
you fucking cowardly fuck.

10:25.383 --> 10:26.418
Fuck you!

10:29.525 --> 10:31.078
I should have killed us both.

10:35.048 --> 10:36.946
I should have killed us both.

10:36.981 --> 10:38.879
But you don't have the courage,
do you?

10:40.225 --> 10:41.054
To die?

10:42.503 --> 10:44.644
To stay forever like
you promised?

10:52.582 --> 10:53.376
Lisa is happy.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.967
[sniffling]

11:06.079 --> 11:07.183
Lisa is happy.

Villa Apartments.

11:10.359 --> 11:11.809
This is Lisa, may I help you?

11:14.121 --> 11:15.813
Yeah, sure, I remember you,
Claire.

11:17.987 --> 11:19.644
Yeah, they're coming
through now.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.507
- Hi, Lisa.

11:24.649 --> 11:26.202
- That's really nice.

11:26.237 --> 11:28.515
Yeah, I got a good feeling
from you guys, too.

11:31.449 --> 11:33.865
Yeah, it'll definitely
be ready by the first.

11:37.282 --> 11:39.353
Okay, great, well, I'm
gonna run these,

11:39.388 --> 11:40.216
and then I'll let you know

11:40.251 --> 11:41.873
on an approval as
soon as possible.

11:44.531 --> 11:45.739
Okay.

11:45.774 --> 11:47.189
Okay.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.224
All right, bye.

11:48.259 --> 11:50.848
- I'm sorry to bother
you. Are you busy, Lisa?

11:50.882 --> 11:52.504
I'm so sorry.

11:52.539 --> 11:54.990
- I'm about to be busy
running some applications.

11:55.024 --> 11:56.439
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:56.474 --> 11:57.993
- [Lisa] That's all right.
What's up?

11:58.027 --> 11:59.753
- No, I can come back.

11:59.788 --> 12:02.342
- Ginny, you can stop
apologizing.

12:03.412 --> 12:04.240
- Okay.

12:05.172 --> 12:06.001
Sorry.

12:07.209 --> 12:08.037
Sorry.

12:11.903 --> 12:12.801
- What do you need?

12:13.733 --> 12:17.115
- It's Wallace. You now,
Wallace, my cat?

12:17.150 --> 12:19.739
- Yeah, how's young
Wallace doing these days?

12:19.773 --> 12:21.637
- [Ginny] I can't find him.

12:21.671 --> 12:22.914
- What do you mean?

12:22.949 --> 12:24.191
- I think he got out.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.125
- Outta your apartment?

12:28.126 --> 12:29.127
- Yeah.

12:29.162 --> 12:29.990
But I don't know how.

12:30.025 --> 12:32.130
He doesn't know how to
survive outside.

12:32.165 --> 12:33.511
- [Lisa] I'm sure he's
probably just

12:33.545 --> 12:34.823
hiding somewhere in
your apartment.

12:34.857 --> 12:35.996
- No!

12:36.031 --> 12:37.515
I looked.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.689
- Okay ... just calm down.

12:40.690 --> 12:42.347
- Well, what am I gonna do?

12:42.382 --> 12:43.797
I raised him since
he was a baby.

12:43.832 --> 12:47.249
He doesn't know how to do
anything outside of the
apartment.

12:47.283 --> 12:49.251
- It's okay, just calm down,
Ginny.

12:49.285 --> 12:50.735
- No, he needs his shots.

12:52.495 --> 12:55.050
- What?

12:55.084 --> 12:56.499
- Wallace suffers from anxiety.

12:56.534 --> 12:59.088
The vet gave him pills,
but he won't take them,

12:59.123 --> 13:01.642
so I have to give him
injections twice a day.

13:02.989 --> 13:04.576
- That ... fits.

13:05.957 --> 13:08.132
You know what? I wouldn't worry.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.547
He couldn't have gotten far.

13:10.479 --> 13:11.583
- You think he's okay?

13:13.102 --> 13:16.071
- Yeah, I'm sure he's just
... somewhere in the building.

13:16.105 --> 13:17.555
- But what if he gets hungry?

13:19.074 --> 13:20.696
- Well then he'll come
out looking for food,

13:20.730 --> 13:22.387
and when he does,
we'll find him.

13:23.768 --> 13:24.596
- Are you sure?

13:26.702 --> 13:28.462
- Well, no, but I usually have

13:28.497 --> 13:29.912
a pretty good feeling
about these things.

13:29.947 --> 13:31.258
- No, you have to find him!

13:34.089 --> 13:35.884
- No, I don't.

13:39.335 --> 13:41.717
But I'll do what I can to help,
all right?

13:42.718 --> 13:46.066
[clock ticking]

13:46.101 --> 13:47.447
- Sorry.

13:47.481 --> 13:48.620
Sorry.

13:48.655 --> 13:50.312
- It's okay. I know
you're upset.

13:51.589 --> 13:54.178
Why don't you go upstairs,
and maybe he'll come back?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.352
- You think he will?

13:57.526 --> 13:59.493
- Well I know if you're
not up there when he does,

13:59.528 --> 14:00.840
then he can't come in.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.428
- You're right.

14:09.331 --> 14:10.159
- Whoa.

14:16.614 --> 14:19.030
[soft music]

14:21.964 --> 14:25.726
- Will and Claire Winston
are moving in today,

14:25.761 --> 14:30.317
a lovely couple, a
lervely, lovely, lovely?

14:31.732 --> 14:32.561
Lovely.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.771
A lovely couple from Texas.

14:36.806 --> 14:39.464
Maybe I'll invite them
around for some iced tea

14:39.499 --> 14:41.190
next time I see them
in the garage.

14:42.467 --> 14:44.884
[soft music]

14:46.989 --> 14:49.923
Tinseltown Villa Apartments.

14:49.958 --> 14:51.373
This is Lisa, may I help you?

14:52.961 --> 14:53.789
Hey, Will.

14:57.172 --> 14:58.483
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

14:58.518 --> 15:00.278
Yeah, no, those are
supposed to be

15:00.313 --> 15:01.555
in your apartment already.

15:03.419 --> 15:04.765
Yeah.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.836
No no no, no, it's no problem,
yeah.

15:06.871 --> 15:08.355
I'll bring you some right now.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.186
- Sorry, Lisa, we really
weren't trying

15:11.220 --> 15:12.014
to be a pain or anything.

15:12.049 --> 15:12.946
- No, no, it's my fault.

15:12.981 --> 15:14.120
These are actually
supposed to be

15:14.154 --> 15:14.948
in the apartment when
you move in.

15:14.983 --> 15:16.536
- Thank you, lifesaver.

15:16.570 --> 15:18.158
I got first shower [chuckles].

15:18.193 --> 15:19.884
- Well chivalry's clearly dead.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.886
- I mean, you can join
if you want to.

15:25.303 --> 15:26.166
Overshare?

15:26.201 --> 15:27.512
- Sorry about him.

15:27.547 --> 15:28.824
He had a few beers before we-

15:28.858 --> 15:31.723
- No I get it, new
apartment, gotta christen it.

15:31.758 --> 15:33.691
- See? She gets it.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.658
And besides, California's
always in a drought, right?

15:35.693 --> 15:37.764
We could all shower together
and save some water.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.731
Welcome to the Left Coast,
man. I'm all for it.

15:39.766 --> 15:41.354
- Will?

15:41.388 --> 15:43.218
- Yeah, I'll be in the
shower if you need me.

15:44.322 --> 15:46.462
- Okay, I think that's
more than enough for now.

15:47.670 --> 15:48.844
Thank you for bringing the rod,

15:48.878 --> 15:51.088
and sorry about my
crude husband.

15:51.122 --> 15:53.021
- If this is the worst thing
I'm gonna have to deal with

15:53.055 --> 15:55.747
from you guys, I think we're
gonna get along just fine.

15:56.783 --> 15:57.611
- Okay.

15:59.372 --> 16:00.200
Well, um.

16:01.546 --> 16:02.375
- Cool.

16:03.376 --> 16:07.000
- Wait, Lisa, actually, I
was wondering,

16:07.035 --> 16:09.451
and feel free to say no if
it's totally out of line, but

16:09.485 --> 16:12.868
I was wondering, since you're
like the only actual actor

16:12.902 --> 16:14.111
I know here in Hollywood,

16:15.595 --> 16:17.148
if we could like sit
down sometime

16:17.183 --> 16:19.288
and I could pick your
brain for some advice.

16:19.323 --> 16:20.151
- Fuck no.

16:22.119 --> 16:23.603
- Okay, no, sorry.

16:23.637 --> 16:24.742
I just [stutters].

16:26.330 --> 16:28.780
[laughing]

16:28.815 --> 16:30.644
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm so sorry.

16:30.679 --> 16:31.611
- Oh my God.

16:31.645 --> 16:32.715
- I couldn't help it.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.924
Yeah, of course, I'm happy
to help any way I can.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.202
- Jesus Christ, that was.

16:37.203 --> 16:38.480
- Yeah.

16:39.722 --> 16:41.966
Any time, yeah, I'm free
tonight actually,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.278
if you wanna stop by later.

16:44.279 --> 16:45.763
- Tonight may not be
great with the whole

16:45.797 --> 16:47.075
like getting settled.

16:47.109 --> 16:49.146
- Moving, sorry, yeah.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.010
- That's okay but ...
tomorrow maybe.

16:51.044 --> 16:51.941
- Yeah, definitely.

16:51.976 --> 16:54.254
Just let me know, I'm
free whenever, so.

16:54.289 --> 16:56.636
- Okay, thank you.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.086
- Yeah, what are friends for?

17:00.571 --> 17:01.468
Cool.

17:01.503 --> 17:03.470
[soft music]

17:03.505 --> 17:05.058
Oh, you bring the wine, though,
right?

17:05.093 --> 17:06.404
- [Claire] Yeah, happy to.

17:07.336 --> 17:09.752
[water running]

17:09.787 --> 17:11.582
- Well, that was embarrassing.

17:11.616 --> 17:13.791
- Aw, she didn't think so.

17:16.863 --> 17:19.797
- Do you still have room for me?

17:19.831 --> 17:23.283
- I thought that you were
too embarrassed.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.906
- I was embarrassed.

17:25.941 --> 17:27.736
But like she said, we still have

17:27.770 --> 17:30.014
to christen this place properly.

17:30.049 --> 17:34.812
- [Will] I knew there's
a reason I loved you.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.228
[soft music]

17:40.749 --> 17:43.545
[engine starting]

18:23.964 --> 18:26.933
[elevator whirring]

18:37.116 --> 18:39.946
[cat growling]

18:39.980 --> 18:43.122
[soft dramatic music]

19:00.173 --> 19:02.658
[cat screaming]

19:02.693 --> 19:05.868
[soft dramatic music]

19:11.667 --> 19:12.841
- Who do we have here?

19:16.293 --> 19:17.915
Young Wallace, I presume?

19:21.229 --> 19:23.265
Hm, how'd you get in here.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.785
[cat purring]

19:27.925 --> 19:30.169
Ginny's been
terribly distraught.

19:31.825 --> 19:32.654
Yeah.

19:35.450 --> 19:38.349
You've been a very, very
naughty kitty.

19:38.384 --> 19:39.523
[cat meowing]

19:39.557 --> 19:41.594
[bones breaking]

19:41.628 --> 19:42.767
Very naughty.

19:42.802 --> 19:45.977
[soft dramatic music]

20:00.302 --> 20:02.615
- Okay, Lisa, I've
finished everything.

20:03.857 --> 20:04.962
- Okay.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.482
Oh, we need more shower
curtain rods.

20:07.516 --> 20:09.415
I gave the last one to 413.

20:09.449 --> 20:12.556
- Oh, there's none
downstairs in the storeroom?

20:12.590 --> 20:14.558
- Mm-mm, just the usual
crap down there.

20:14.592 --> 20:15.524
I went and checked.

20:16.974 --> 20:19.597
Which we should probably get
that junk out, by the way.

20:19.632 --> 20:21.979
That stupid barrel's been
down there since I moved in.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.602
- Yeah, you know, they came
to redo the elevator shaft

20:24.637 --> 20:27.433
and they left that like
10 years ago.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.610
- Right, so we should
probably haul it away, right?

20:32.645 --> 20:33.473
- Mm.

20:34.785 --> 20:35.717
- Mm.

20:35.751 --> 20:38.375
[clock ticking]

20:45.451 --> 20:48.730
- Okay. I'll be in Lankershim.

20:48.764 --> 20:52.078
You know, coming up to get
ready for the inspection there.

20:52.112 --> 20:54.011
- Right, how long's
that gonna talk.

20:54.045 --> 20:58.360
- Ooh, don't know but they say
we have to retile everything

20:58.395 --> 21:00.638
and all that before
the city comes.

21:01.570 --> 21:02.985
Ay, Madre.

21:03.020 --> 21:05.781
- Okay, so what if we
have maintenance issues?

21:05.816 --> 21:09.129
[clock ticking]

21:09.164 --> 21:12.685
- Talk to Ted, but you
know he's got me

21:12.719 --> 21:15.619
and Luis and Pancho all there.

21:15.653 --> 21:16.965
He say you don't have apartment,

21:16.999 --> 21:20.140
so you don't need me for a
month at least.

21:20.175 --> 21:21.003
He say.

21:21.970 --> 21:24.283
- Yeah, we've only got
100 apartments.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.802
What could possibly go
wrong in a month?

21:26.837 --> 21:29.460
[clock ticking]

21:40.057 --> 21:40.989
- Okay.

21:42.439 --> 21:43.371
I'll see you, Lisa.

21:44.510 --> 21:45.476
- Have a good night.

21:51.655 --> 21:52.759
[door crashing open]

21:52.794 --> 21:54.554
- Holy shit, Claire.

21:54.589 --> 21:56.625
- You don't want salad?

21:56.660 --> 21:57.695
- Of course I do.

21:57.730 --> 21:59.490
Thank you, by the way.

21:59.525 --> 22:02.251
But you haven't been
outside lately, have you?

22:02.286 --> 22:03.218
- No, why?

22:03.252 --> 22:04.392
- Because there's a
whole fucking scene

22:04.426 --> 22:06.290
happening down at
the front door.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.602
- Details.

22:08.844 --> 22:11.468
- Okay, so, I'm making my
way up to the front, right?

22:11.502 --> 22:12.331
- Right.

22:14.125 --> 22:17.266
- I see like, two cop cars,
a firetruck, an ambulance.

22:17.301 --> 22:18.302
- Holy crap.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.718
- Yeah, then all of
sudden there's this woman,

22:20.753 --> 22:22.479
just like screaming and yelling.

22:22.513 --> 22:24.550
I mean, just completely
losing her shit.

22:26.448 --> 22:28.692
I know, right?

22:28.726 --> 22:31.833
So, as I'm making her way up,
I see her and she's just like,

22:31.867 --> 22:33.697
the cops are trying to
calm her down to get her

22:33.731 --> 22:36.320
on the stretcher, but she's
just ranting and raving,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.322
and I mean kicking at them
like a fucking lunatic.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.323
- Seriously?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.428
- Yeah.

22:40.462 --> 22:41.325
Dead serious.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.396
She was just like fucking
yelling at them.

22:44.328 --> 22:46.226
- Well what was she saying?

22:46.261 --> 22:48.746
- All I could make out
between the sobs was,

22:48.781 --> 22:50.817
my cat, my cat.

22:50.852 --> 22:51.887
And she yells out the
name Wallace

22:51.922 --> 22:54.752
right as they tied her
down to the stretcher.

22:54.787 --> 22:56.236
- Oh, geez.

22:57.686 --> 22:58.480
- Fucking crazy.

23:02.691 --> 23:04.555
Well, how was your day?

23:06.419 --> 23:08.904
- Well, clearly not as
exciting as yours.

23:08.939 --> 23:10.354
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.770
I spent the rest of my
morning at work.

23:12.805 --> 23:15.601
- It's only your first day.
How can you be like that?

23:15.635 --> 23:16.912
- What can I say?

23:16.947 --> 23:20.606
It's work. It's meetings
and cubicles and ... work.

23:21.676 --> 23:24.195
- You make it sound so awful.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.127
- That's my way, babe.

23:26.335 --> 23:29.269
Which is why I'd rather hear
more about you, beautiful.

23:32.238 --> 23:33.619
So, do tell.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.829
- Oh, well, if you must know.

23:38.693 --> 23:40.798
I did some yoga after you left,

23:40.833 --> 23:44.940
and then I went for a
walk, got some coffee,

23:44.975 --> 23:47.115
took a look around the
neighborhood.

23:47.149 --> 23:48.427
And-

23:48.461 --> 23:50.601
- Did you find anything good?

23:50.636 --> 23:53.155
- No psychotic ravings
about their cat,

23:53.190 --> 23:54.053
if that's what you mean.

23:54.087 --> 23:56.020
- Feel safer already.

23:56.055 --> 23:57.090
- Right?

23:57.125 --> 23:58.506
Oh, I submitted for
some auditions

23:58.540 --> 23:59.852
before coming back here and

24:00.887 --> 24:01.716
making lunch.

24:02.889 --> 24:04.443
- And?

24:04.477 --> 24:05.858
- And what?

24:05.892 --> 24:07.929
- Did you get anything good?

24:07.963 --> 24:09.689
- It's Day One, honey.

24:09.724 --> 24:10.759
- So?

24:10.794 --> 24:12.071
- So, it doesn't work like that.

24:12.105 --> 24:13.141
- It might.

24:13.175 --> 24:13.797
- It doesn't.

24:14.936 --> 24:17.835
But I am meeting with Lisa
later, and we're gonna

24:17.870 --> 24:20.113
learn how to hopefully
speed up the process.

24:21.045 --> 24:21.943
- Nice.

24:21.977 --> 24:22.806
- Yeah.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.672
- Hey, try to figure out
the story of the cat lady.

24:26.706 --> 24:28.121
- Oh, you can guarantee,

24:28.156 --> 24:31.435
that'll be the first on
my list of questions.

24:36.923 --> 24:39.788
[soft piano music]

25:17.757 --> 25:21.278
[knocking on door]

25:21.312 --> 25:22.141
- Coming.

25:36.293 --> 25:37.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:37.639 --> 25:38.882
- [Claire] Is now
still a good time?

25:38.916 --> 25:40.262
- [Lisa] Yeah, yeah, come in.

25:42.299 --> 25:43.783
- Oh, wow.

25:43.818 --> 25:45.578
- Yeah, sorry about the mess.

25:45.613 --> 25:48.995
- No, I meant, wow, this is
so different from our place.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.376
- Oh yeah.

25:50.410 --> 25:51.998
The remodeled units are
really different,

25:52.033 --> 25:55.277
but the manager before me
was here for like 20 years,

25:55.312 --> 25:57.797
so ... kind of one
of a kind now.

25:58.902 --> 26:00.420
- I really like it.

26:00.455 --> 26:01.939
- Thanks.

26:01.974 --> 26:04.045
- Oh my God, is that you?

26:04.079 --> 26:06.150
- [Lisa] Oh, it's from
a film I shot.

26:06.185 --> 26:09.050
I swear, I don't just sit
around watching myself all day.

26:09.084 --> 26:10.810
- My God, that is so awesome.

26:12.225 --> 26:13.572
Can I see?

26:15.194 --> 26:19.992
- Um ... it's just that
it's not done yet, so.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.408
- No, I didn't, sorry.

26:22.442 --> 26:24.030
- No, it's okay, I just,

26:24.065 --> 26:26.481
I just haven't had a chance
to see how bad I am yet.

26:26.515 --> 26:27.655
- Come on.

26:27.689 --> 26:29.208
- You never know. I'm serious.

26:30.140 --> 26:33.177
Okay ... you want
something to drink?

26:34.282 --> 26:37.596
- Oh, as promised, I
brought the wine.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.458
- Oh.

26:39.494 --> 26:40.357
Fancy.

26:41.427 --> 26:42.255
Have a seat.

26:48.330 --> 26:51.920
- Oh, Will said there was
something about,

26:53.266 --> 26:55.614
there was something outside
today with the police.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.477
- [Ginny] Oh, Wallace.

26:59.031 --> 27:01.240
- [Lisa] One of our
tenant's cat died,

27:01.274 --> 27:03.863
and she was really
upset about it.

27:03.898 --> 27:05.554
- Wait, her cat died,

27:05.589 --> 27:07.660
and she had to be
restrained in a stretcher?

27:09.386 --> 27:12.734
- Yeah, she's got ... issues.

27:12.769 --> 27:13.666
Bless her heart, you know what,

27:13.701 --> 27:15.599
I probably shouldn't be
talking about it.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.844
- No, oh, I don't wanna pry
if you can't talk about it.

27:18.878 --> 27:23.572
- Don't leave me, please
don't leave me, please don't.

27:23.607 --> 27:26.299
- It's fine. I can probably
tell you about it if you just

27:26.334 --> 27:28.336
promise not to, like,
share it around.

27:28.370 --> 27:29.613
- No, totally.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.476
I won't say anything,

27:30.510 --> 27:32.927
but who do I know
besides you anyway?

27:32.961 --> 27:35.239
- Oh, Wallace [cries].

27:35.274 --> 27:36.793
- All right, I'll trust you.

27:36.827 --> 27:40.348
But if you tell anybody,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

27:41.349 --> 27:43.489
[laughing]

27:43.523 --> 27:45.767
So, her name is Ginny.

27:45.802 --> 27:49.046
And she takes ... a
lotta medications,

27:49.081 --> 27:50.496
just to get through her day.

27:50.530 --> 27:53.672
And by a lot, I mean like
... 30 different things.

27:55.328 --> 27:56.778
So when her cat died, I
guess it just

27:56.813 --> 27:58.677
musta been too much for her.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.024
[sobbing]

28:01.058 --> 28:02.301
- Wallace, Wallace.

28:02.335 --> 28:05.235
- [Claire] Did she see it,
get hit by a car or something?

28:05.269 --> 28:06.754
- No, nothing like that even.

28:09.204 --> 28:12.898
Ginny's just extremely
sensitive to small changes.

28:14.762 --> 28:18.213
She's schizophrenic, paranoid,

28:18.248 --> 28:20.319
severe OCD, manic, all that.

28:25.186 --> 28:26.083
- [Lisa] Manager.

28:26.118 --> 28:28.776
- So, okay, she comes
into my office,

28:28.810 --> 28:30.950
she tells me that she
thinks her cat is missing.

28:30.985 --> 28:32.124
So I tell her, you know,

28:32.158 --> 28:35.092
I'm sure it's probably
just hiding or something.

28:35.127 --> 28:37.301
She tells me that she
looked everywhere for it.

28:38.406 --> 28:40.926
I told her it was probably
just under the bed,

28:40.960 --> 28:43.722
not to worry, that we'd let
her know if we found anything.

28:43.756 --> 28:48.727
But, turns out it was just
under her bed, the whole time.

28:50.694 --> 28:53.835
Yeah, I think the smell
finally tipped her off.

28:54.767 --> 28:55.595
- Oh God.

29:00.359 --> 29:04.639
- Just goes to show you that
... sanity's a fragile thing.

29:09.851 --> 29:11.197
I lie on the floor,

29:12.405 --> 29:14.373
watched by nothing
and hanging on.

29:16.789 --> 29:17.790
I cry at night.

29:19.481 --> 29:22.761
I'm afraid of hearing voices,
or a voice.

29:25.142 --> 29:27.317
I have come to the
edge of the land.

29:28.732 --> 29:30.113
I could get pushed over.

29:36.395 --> 29:37.292
Margaret Atwood.

29:39.432 --> 29:41.572
It's from her book Cat's Eye.

29:41.607 --> 29:43.195
You should check it
out sometime.

29:45.162 --> 29:47.820
Anyway, enough talk
about being crazy,

29:47.855 --> 29:49.753
let's talk about acting.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.135
- Thought you said enough talk
about being crazy [laughs].

29:53.653 --> 29:56.829
[dramatic music]

29:56.864 --> 29:59.383
- Hey, there you are.

29:59.418 --> 30:01.489
Thought I was gonna have to
send out a search party for you.

30:01.523 --> 30:02.559
- Sorry, honey.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.422
- Wait.

30:05.769 --> 30:09.083
Somebody's been in the
wine, it tastes like.

30:09.117 --> 30:12.155
- I may have finished a
bottle with Lisa.

30:12.189 --> 30:13.156
- A whole bottle?

30:13.190 --> 30:14.398
- It was a team effort.

30:16.159 --> 30:19.334
- How Hollywood of you,
on a Monday afternoon.

30:19.369 --> 30:20.715
- When in Rome.

30:20.749 --> 30:21.578
- True.

30:23.028 --> 30:25.030
So what else did you learn
on your Roman holiday?

30:25.064 --> 30:27.066
- Quite a lot, actually.

30:27.101 --> 30:29.758
Did you know that she spends
a couple hours every day

30:29.793 --> 30:32.589
recording herself just
to perfect her craft?

30:32.623 --> 30:33.003
- Really?

30:33.038 --> 30:34.280
- Mm-hmm.

30:34.315 --> 30:35.764
And then she'll wait a couple
weeks, and then she'll go back

30:35.799 --> 30:39.320
and critique herself, always
with the sound off, though.

30:39.354 --> 30:41.425
- I mean, I do the same thing.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.703
Granted it's just cellphone
video of me masturbating,

30:43.738 --> 30:46.465
but I really find it helps
my performance.

30:46.499 --> 30:49.123
- Strange you don't seem to
be getting any better in bed.

30:49.157 --> 30:49.986
- Touche.

30:52.816 --> 30:54.680
So what other kinda
pearls did she teach you?

30:54.714 --> 30:55.923
- Tons.

30:55.957 --> 30:59.340
Seriously, things I would
not have even thought of.

30:59.374 --> 31:00.651
- Good.

31:00.686 --> 31:02.136
- Yeah.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.275
She's very nice.

31:05.277 --> 31:08.590
- Aw, somebody's got
them a new friend.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.041
- Stop it [laughs].

31:11.076 --> 31:13.595
- Seriously, I'm glad you
guys are hitting it off.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.425
She seems like a
pretty cool chick.

31:15.459 --> 31:18.117
- Yeah, and I invited her
over for dinner

31:18.152 --> 31:19.291
this weekend, actually.

31:19.325 --> 31:22.121
- Ugh, speaking of dinner,
I can't live on beer alone.

31:22.156 --> 31:23.985
Are you cooking something,
or am I ordering in?

31:24.020 --> 31:25.607
- You're truly helpless
without me, aren't you?

31:25.642 --> 31:26.539
- What?

31:26.574 --> 31:27.644
No, I'm not.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.266
I can easily dial the
number to several different

31:29.301 --> 31:30.681
pizza places that deliver.

31:30.716 --> 31:32.683
- Oh, pizza does sound good.

31:32.718 --> 31:34.168
- Pizza it is.

31:34.202 --> 31:36.722
- Will, I forgot to tell
you about the cat lady.

31:37.550 --> 31:38.517
- Oh yeah.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.588
Pizza first, then the cat lady.

33:46.162 --> 33:48.302
[sipping]

33:50.718 --> 33:52.685
- [Will] Tonight, on
Before They Were Famous.

33:52.720 --> 33:53.824
- Will, no.

33:53.859 --> 33:56.551
- [Will] Claire Winston,
once a small town Texas girl,

33:56.586 --> 33:58.415
now a budding Hollywood starlet.

33:58.450 --> 33:59.278
- Stop.

33:59.313 --> 34:00.659
- [Will] How does she prepare?

34:00.693 --> 34:02.281
What does she read?

34:02.316 --> 34:05.008
We have the exclusive interview.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.044
- Stop, no.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.735
- [Will] Come on, honey.

34:07.769 --> 34:09.392
Your public needs you.

34:09.426 --> 34:10.772
- [Claire] I look so awful.

34:10.807 --> 34:12.947
- [Will] A young woman
wracked by self-doubt

34:12.981 --> 34:14.983
becomes a Hollywood icon.

34:15.018 --> 34:18.608
Today we go inside ...
Claire Winston.

34:20.782 --> 34:24.579
- You know, people often ask me,

34:24.614 --> 34:27.479
Claire, how do you do it?

34:27.513 --> 34:30.137
- [Will] That's exactly
what our viewers are asking.

34:30.171 --> 34:32.000
- Do you really wanna
know my secret?

34:34.486 --> 34:35.659
One word, Will.

34:35.694 --> 34:37.213
Just one word.

34:38.421 --> 34:40.078
Gluten-free.

34:45.635 --> 34:48.224
- Tune in next week for an
episode of Where Are They Now

34:48.258 --> 34:50.812
featuring that kid from
the movie in 1992?

34:54.747 --> 34:56.439
Yeah, that's a wrap.

34:56.473 --> 34:57.612
- [laughs] Will.

35:00.615 --> 35:03.791
[Will moaning]

35:03.825 --> 35:05.241
- I love you, Claire Winston.

35:12.317 --> 35:13.111
What?

35:15.527 --> 35:17.253
- Do you really think
I'll make it?

35:19.876 --> 35:22.913
- I have zero doubt that
you're gonna be successful.

35:22.948 --> 35:24.363
- Why?

35:24.398 --> 35:26.986
- Because you're really
fucking talented.

35:27.021 --> 35:31.405
- Yeah, maybe in honky
tonk Texas, but this is LA.

35:31.439 --> 35:33.648
- Talent isn't regional, Claire.

35:34.753 --> 35:36.306
You either have it or you don't.

35:39.654 --> 35:40.655
And you have it.

35:45.488 --> 35:46.937
- I love you, Will Winston.

35:48.732 --> 35:49.561
- That'll do.

35:51.114 --> 35:52.253
Now give me some sugar.

35:55.014 --> 35:58.328
[soft mysterious music]

36:02.229 --> 36:03.437
- Hey, how's it-

36:04.472 --> 36:06.681
Oh my God, Will, I am so sorry,
oh my God.

36:06.716 --> 36:08.027
- It's okay.

36:09.339 --> 36:10.168
It's fine.

36:12.584 --> 36:13.861
- Did you get any on you?

36:13.895 --> 36:15.103
- Oh, no no no [laughs].

36:17.761 --> 36:18.624
Drought prevention, right?

36:18.659 --> 36:21.420
Just saving water by
showing in coffee.

36:21.455 --> 36:22.249
- I'll get it.

36:24.734 --> 36:27.012
God, I'm such an idiot.
I'm so sorry.

36:27.046 --> 36:28.669
- It's all right. If I
wasn't such a candy ass,

36:28.703 --> 36:31.465
maybe I wouldn't have jumped
at the sound of your voice.

36:31.499 --> 36:32.466
- If only I had a
nickel for every guy

36:32.500 --> 36:35.054
that jumped at the
sound of my voice.

36:35.089 --> 36:35.986
- Oh yeah?

36:36.021 --> 36:39.127
[laughs] Well I guess we
gotta communicate

36:39.162 --> 36:40.888
via body language
from now on then.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.202
- That's definitely one
way to do it.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.930
- Or you could just agree not
to sneak up on hapless dudes

36:48.965 --> 36:50.656
with coffee early in
the morning.

36:50.691 --> 36:52.071
- That is probably safer.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.420
Fuck.

36:55.454 --> 36:56.766
- I gotta get to work.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.767
- Yeah, sorry.

37:03.428 --> 37:05.947
- Hey, since you made me spill
my coffee, you better bring

37:05.982 --> 37:08.295
some good beer or something
when you come over for dinner.

37:08.329 --> 37:09.157
- Will do.

37:17.304 --> 37:19.789
[keys striking]

37:19.823 --> 37:22.240
[soft music]

37:42.708 --> 37:44.572
[laughing]

37:44.607 --> 37:45.573
- Oh my God.

37:48.438 --> 37:50.544
[laughing]

37:50.578 --> 37:52.960
[soft music]

38:01.520 --> 38:04.178
[gear shifting]

38:10.253 --> 38:13.601
[phone ringing]

38:13.636 --> 38:16.432
[phone vibrating]

38:19.918 --> 38:20.953
[phone ringing]

38:20.988 --> 38:22.300
- No, Claire, no.

38:41.905 --> 38:44.080
[sighing]

38:47.532 --> 38:49.499
You think this is easy for me?

38:58.715 --> 38:59.544
Lisa is good.

39:04.790 --> 39:05.826
Lisa is good.

39:13.247 --> 39:15.214
[keys jingling]

39:15.249 --> 39:16.630
Don't fuck it up.

39:20.530 --> 39:23.119
[door opening]

39:29.090 --> 39:31.645
[door closing]

39:34.648 --> 39:35.925
- No, I didn't like
her take on it.

39:35.959 --> 39:38.617
- I just felt like she looked
really fat in her skirt.

39:41.551 --> 39:43.450
- I'm sorry, they said
to just come in.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.904
- Of course, please.

39:54.461 --> 39:55.393
- Head shot, resume?

39:55.427 --> 39:56.670
- Yeah, right here.

40:01.606 --> 40:02.400
- Lisa Rybicki.

40:04.263 --> 40:05.092
Polish?

40:06.611 --> 40:07.784
- I'm sorry.

40:07.819 --> 40:09.476
- [Carlo] Are you Polish?

40:09.510 --> 40:11.581
- Yeah, my last name is.

40:11.616 --> 40:13.134
- Do you speak it?

40:13.169 --> 40:14.791
- Polish?

40:14.826 --> 40:16.206
- Yes.

40:16.241 --> 40:16.793
- No.

40:17.932 --> 40:21.211
I think my family's been
in the US for generations.

40:21.246 --> 40:23.559
- Who are you repped by, Lisa?

40:23.593 --> 40:26.354
- I'm actually in between
management at the moment.

40:32.499 --> 40:35.156
- All right, Lisa, you'll
be reading with Clio today.

40:35.191 --> 40:36.468
You can start it.

40:36.503 --> 40:38.884
- [Clio] Okay, if you
can start with your name,

40:38.919 --> 40:41.300
the role you're here for
and who you're repped by.

40:42.474 --> 40:46.271
- Hi, Lisa Rybicki, reading
for the role of Gemini.

40:46.305 --> 40:49.101
Self submission, I guess.

40:50.689 --> 40:52.450
- [Carlo] And action.

41:08.017 --> 41:10.260
[crying]

41:10.295 --> 41:11.607
- Fucking idiot.

41:12.884 --> 41:15.645
You're a fucking stupid
piece of shit.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.751
[crying]

41:19.407 --> 41:20.236
Stupid.

41:23.446 --> 41:24.689
You have no talent.

41:25.931 --> 41:30.073
Everybody hates you, and
you're never gonna be anything.

41:30.108 --> 41:32.282
[sobbing]

41:39.151 --> 41:41.913
[hard breathing]

41:43.604 --> 41:46.504
[soft piano music]

41:59.033 --> 42:01.553
[sobbing]

42:01.588 --> 42:04.487
[soft piano music]

42:14.255 --> 42:17.120
[deep breathing]

42:17.155 --> 42:20.089
[soft piano music]

42:26.889 --> 42:27.717
Lisa is happy.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.658
[engine starting]

42:37.693 --> 42:40.834
[soft dramatic music]

42:52.984 --> 42:57.954
- Claire?

43:04.858 --> 43:07.515
[keys jingling]

43:17.560 --> 43:20.218
[door creaking]

43:21.460 --> 43:25.775
Claire?

43:25.810 --> 43:28.640
Claire?

43:28.675 --> 43:31.332
[door creaking]

43:34.301 --> 43:35.371
Claire? Will?

44:35.189 --> 44:39.297
In winter with warm
tears, I'll melt the snow.

44:41.609 --> 44:43.853
And keep eternal
springtime on my way.

45:11.881 --> 45:14.781
[soft piano music]

49:07.737 --> 49:09.015
- [Claire] Lisa.

49:09.049 --> 49:11.569
- Hey. Sorry I missed your call.

49:11.603 --> 49:13.743
I was just leaving you a note,

49:13.778 --> 49:15.745
telling you to drop by whenever.

49:15.780 --> 49:17.402
What was so urgent?

49:17.437 --> 49:19.335
- Oh, well, since you're
here, just come in.

49:19.370 --> 49:20.302
I'll tell you all about it.

49:20.336 --> 49:21.130
- [Lisa] Okay.

49:23.477 --> 49:26.894
- So last night, I was
submitting my head shots,

49:26.929 --> 49:28.241
through one of the websites
that you showed me.

49:28.275 --> 49:29.104
- Uh-huh.

49:29.138 --> 49:30.036
- And this morning I
got an email

49:30.070 --> 49:31.278
saying they wanna tape audition.

49:31.313 --> 49:32.107
- Oh, that's go great.

49:32.141 --> 49:33.315
- I know!

49:33.349 --> 49:34.972
I mean, it's just an audition.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.766
- No, it's a start.

49:36.801 --> 49:37.905
- I know, right?

49:37.940 --> 49:38.768
Oh my God.

49:38.803 --> 49:40.770
- So what do you need
my help with?

49:40.805 --> 49:42.910
- Okay, this sounds
really stupid,

49:42.945 --> 49:46.811
but I've never had to do a
self-tape audition before.

49:46.845 --> 49:48.916
- Oh, you want me to help
you do your self-tape?

49:48.951 --> 49:51.091
- Well, I mean, I got
this tripod and stuff.

49:51.126 --> 49:52.506
And I could just set
up my phone,

49:52.541 --> 49:55.095
but I was wondering if
you could read with me.

49:55.130 --> 49:56.096
- Yeah.

49:56.131 --> 49:57.201
- I mean, you don't have
to if you don't want to.

49:57.235 --> 49:58.443
It's totally okay.

49:58.478 --> 50:00.963
- Claire, stop, yes, I
am happy to help you.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.482
- I can get Will to do it.

50:02.516 --> 50:04.449
- No, no, I'm happy to help.

50:04.484 --> 50:05.554
- Okay, thanks.

50:05.588 --> 50:06.555
- The Sides? What's the role?

50:06.589 --> 50:08.212
- Yeah.

50:08.246 --> 50:12.250
They did the in-person
auditions today,

50:12.285 --> 50:13.769
but they liked my look enough.

50:13.803 --> 50:16.047
Said just see what I
could do with it.

50:17.048 --> 50:18.187
I'm reading for Gemini.

50:22.226 --> 50:23.365
- Yeah.

50:23.399 --> 50:26.057
[soft dramatic music]

50:26.092 --> 50:28.335
Okay, yeah.

50:30.510 --> 50:33.202
You definitely look right for
the role, from what I see.

50:33.237 --> 50:34.997
- [Claire] They want it
tomorrow by five,

50:35.032 --> 50:36.619
so I'm really gonna
have to work my ass off

50:36.654 --> 50:37.758
to learn this tonight.

50:42.039 --> 50:45.973
- Well, I'm gonna let you
get to it then.

50:46.008 --> 50:48.079
And then maybe we can
meet up tomorrow

50:48.114 --> 50:49.011
afternoon to record it.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.495
- Thank you so much.

50:50.530 --> 50:53.843
[soft dramatic music]

50:53.878 --> 50:56.881
[soft piano music]

50:56.915 --> 50:58.538
- Yeah, you're welcome.

50:58.572 --> 50:59.987
Good luck.

51:00.022 --> 51:02.956
[soft piano music]

51:07.823 --> 51:10.998
[soft dramatic music]

51:58.805 --> 52:01.359
[wine pouring]

52:02.291 --> 52:05.398
[soft dramatic music]

52:49.269 --> 52:53.100
[intermittent dramatic music]

52:57.035 --> 52:59.348
- Don't spill your coffee.
It's just me.

52:59.383 --> 53:01.626
- Thanks for the
warning this time.

53:01.661 --> 53:03.145
Hey, I thought one of the
perks of being

53:03.180 --> 53:04.664
an actor was that you
get to sleep in.

53:04.698 --> 53:06.528
What are you doing up so early?

53:06.562 --> 53:09.186
- Stalking you, obviously.

53:09.220 --> 53:10.325
- Well, it happens.

53:10.359 --> 53:12.085
- I'm only human.

53:12.119 --> 53:14.363
No, I do a building
walk-through every morning

53:14.398 --> 53:16.883
just to ensure your
personal safety.

53:16.917 --> 53:18.125
- My personal safety, huh?

53:18.160 --> 53:22.371
- Mm-hm, you ... and every
other tenant in the building.

53:22.406 --> 53:24.684
- Here I was, thinking
I was special.

53:24.718 --> 53:26.927
- Oh no, you are special.
You are.

53:28.101 --> 53:30.207
- Be sure and tell my wife that,
will you?

53:30.241 --> 53:32.105
- She needs some reminding?

53:32.139 --> 53:32.968
- Maybe.

53:34.659 --> 53:35.557
It's nothing.

53:35.591 --> 53:36.903
I think she's just
stressing about this

53:36.937 --> 53:38.145
audition that she's got.

53:39.768 --> 53:41.735
- And?

53:41.770 --> 53:43.944
- And, I might have been a bit

53:43.979 --> 53:46.050
of a selfish asshole last night.

53:46.084 --> 53:48.017
- You, a selfish asshole?

53:48.052 --> 53:50.537
- You tell her I said
that, and I'll kill you.

53:50.572 --> 53:52.332
- Careful, Will, you
don't want me

53:52.367 --> 53:54.092
to have something
like that on you.

53:55.197 --> 53:56.647
- Oh yeah?

53:56.681 --> 53:58.131
- [Lisa] Oh yeah.

53:59.546 --> 54:01.341
- Women, incorrigible.

54:02.515 --> 54:04.137
- Aren't we just?

54:06.173 --> 54:08.417
- Anyway, will you help her
do good on this audition

54:08.452 --> 54:10.350
so she's in a good mood
when I come home?

54:10.385 --> 54:11.662
- Anything for you, Champ.

54:12.663 --> 54:14.837
- Careful, might hold
you to that.

54:17.081 --> 54:18.565
- Maybe I'll hold you to that.

54:22.224 --> 54:23.121
- You are trouble.

54:33.166 --> 54:35.996
[engine starting]

54:48.699 --> 54:50.114
- Do I look okay?

54:52.392 --> 54:53.220
- Just hang on.

54:59.537 --> 55:00.607
Okay, look at me.

55:06.164 --> 55:07.994
You wanna do a practice one?

55:08.028 --> 55:09.685
- No, let's just go.

55:11.273 --> 55:12.101
- Okay.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.761
[camera beeping]

55:23.389 --> 55:24.597
- You think this is easy?

55:27.600 --> 55:30.085
Do you think this is
fucking easy for me,

55:30.119 --> 55:32.708
dressing this way and
doing the things

55:32.743 --> 55:34.883
that I have to do every night?

55:34.917 --> 55:35.780
- [Lisa] You don't
have to do them.

55:35.815 --> 55:36.919
- Don't I?

55:36.954 --> 55:37.610
- [Lisa] No.

55:38.852 --> 55:41.959
- Then who's gonna take care
of you, of us, if I don't?

55:43.029 --> 55:45.687
Who's gonna pay for your
school and put clothes

55:45.721 --> 55:47.344
on your back and food
in your stomach

55:47.378 --> 55:48.690
if I don't go out and
work at night?

55:48.724 --> 55:50.139
- [Lisa] You know what I mean.

55:50.174 --> 55:51.658
- No, I don't.

55:51.693 --> 55:55.213
So please, tell me, tell
me how we're gonna survive

55:55.248 --> 55:57.250
without the money that I make.

55:57.284 --> 55:58.769
- [Lisa] You could do
something else.

55:58.803 --> 56:01.081
You don't have to do that.

56:01.116 --> 56:02.669
- Don't you tell me
what I have to do,

56:02.704 --> 56:04.291
when all I've known since
Mom and Dad died

56:04.326 --> 56:06.570
is that I have to
take care of you.

56:06.604 --> 56:07.536
- [Lisa] Mom and Dad
wouldn't want you

56:07.571 --> 56:09.711
to be a whore, Gemini,
even for me.

56:14.992 --> 56:17.581
[scoffing]

56:17.615 --> 56:19.134
- Right, no, you're right.

56:21.378 --> 56:24.242
Maybe ... maybe I'm a whore,

56:24.277 --> 56:28.108
but someday maybe you'll
realize that I only

56:28.143 --> 56:30.456
became a whore so that
you never had to.

56:34.667 --> 56:37.877
[feet stepping]

56:37.911 --> 56:40.811
[soft piano music]

56:41.846 --> 56:42.778
Was that okay?

56:43.745 --> 56:45.471
- Shit, sorry, yeah.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.025
- Do we have to do it again?

56:48.059 --> 56:50.752
- No, that was awesome.

56:50.786 --> 56:51.684
- Really?

56:51.718 --> 56:53.410
- Yeah, I mean, you can
do another one

56:53.444 --> 56:56.274
for safety, if you want,
but that was,

56:56.309 --> 56:57.552
that was really good.

56:57.586 --> 56:58.587
- Seriously?

56:58.622 --> 56:59.795
- Yeah.

56:59.830 --> 57:00.658
You're good.

57:01.694 --> 57:03.074
Here, come here, come watch.

57:04.110 --> 57:07.044
[soft piano music]

57:08.045 --> 57:10.703
[knife cutting]

57:10.737 --> 57:11.566
- Hey!

57:11.600 --> 57:12.532
- Oh my God.

57:12.567 --> 57:13.533
- Got ya, didn't I?

57:14.465 --> 57:15.915
- Good one.

57:15.949 --> 57:17.019
- Oh.

57:17.054 --> 57:19.746
This looks fancy.
What's the occasion?

57:19.781 --> 57:21.334
- We're having Lisa for dinner.

57:22.266 --> 57:24.510
- Interesting, looks
like pasta to me.

57:30.826 --> 57:31.965
- Ah, those are for the hummus.

57:32.000 --> 57:32.828
- Just one.

57:41.078 --> 57:41.906
So?

57:45.013 --> 57:45.910
Still mad at me?

57:48.223 --> 57:49.051
- Depends.

57:50.328 --> 57:51.709
Are you still being a jerk?

57:52.641 --> 57:53.470
- Jerk?

57:57.922 --> 57:59.890
Come, come, you wasp--

57:59.924 --> 58:02.479
- No no, no no no, don't
you try and Shakespeare

58:02.513 --> 58:03.928
your way outta this one with me,
Mister.

58:03.963 --> 58:04.791
- No?

58:06.103 --> 58:08.381
What if I wanna compare
you to a summer's day?

58:10.141 --> 58:11.729
Which is true.

58:11.764 --> 58:14.767
Thou art more lovely
and more fair.

58:14.801 --> 58:17.286
- Words of so sweet breath
composed, but since you

58:17.321 --> 58:19.392
are not Shakespeare,
there's only one word

58:19.426 --> 58:20.497
I need to hear, Will.

58:23.810 --> 58:24.673
- Colostomy?

58:27.642 --> 58:29.816
- Gingerbread, perhaps.

58:29.851 --> 58:30.817
- Better, but no.

58:35.719 --> 58:37.824
[speaks foreign language]

58:37.859 --> 58:40.240
- I don't even know
what that means.

58:40.275 --> 58:41.103
- It means,

58:46.246 --> 58:47.075
I'm sorry.

58:49.940 --> 58:50.803
- You're forgiven.

58:55.359 --> 58:56.153
Now go get cleaned up

58:56.187 --> 58:57.534
before she gets here, okay?

59:02.262 --> 59:03.056
Will!

59:03.091 --> 59:04.402
- Just one more.

59:06.163 --> 59:09.338
[soft dramatic music]

1:01:40.075 --> 1:01:41.490
- Lisa is pretty.

1:01:46.737 --> 1:01:47.980
Lisa is pretty.

1:01:52.743 --> 1:01:54.952
[exhaling]

1:01:59.163 --> 1:02:00.130
Lisa is pretty.

1:02:09.139 --> 1:02:10.243
- Stop.

1:02:10.278 --> 1:02:12.004
Stop.
- No no, no no no, keep going.

1:02:12.038 --> 1:02:13.868
I wanna hear about my
superstar in the making wife.

1:02:13.902 --> 1:02:15.041
- She was.

1:02:15.076 --> 1:02:18.148
I literally felt like there
was a 20-year-old stripper

1:02:18.182 --> 1:02:20.598
trying to support her sister,

1:02:20.633 --> 1:02:22.497
just standing there in
my apartment.

1:02:23.705 --> 1:02:24.533
She's gifted.

1:02:25.707 --> 1:02:26.535
Truly.

1:02:27.778 --> 1:02:29.366
- Thanks.

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:31.333
But I couldn't have done
it without you.

1:02:32.679 --> 1:02:33.404
- [Will] Here here.

1:02:34.612 --> 1:02:36.131
Here's to me banging a
20-year-old stripper tonight.

1:02:36.166 --> 1:02:38.099
- Okay, don't be so crass.

1:02:38.133 --> 1:02:40.239
- No, here's to the
producers recognizing

1:02:40.273 --> 1:02:41.619
true talent when they see it.

1:02:41.654 --> 1:02:44.588
[glasses clinking]

1:02:47.384 --> 1:02:48.350
- Ah.

1:02:48.385 --> 1:02:50.042
- You don't need any more,
either.

1:02:53.252 --> 1:02:54.080
- Kill it.

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:58.326
Wine police say I don't
need any more of that.

1:02:59.672 --> 1:03:00.500
Love you, babe.

1:03:02.744 --> 1:03:05.574
[throat clearing]

1:03:07.266 --> 1:03:09.268
So, Lisa.

1:03:11.166 --> 1:03:12.650
What's your story?

1:03:12.685 --> 1:03:14.514
What's a hot chick like
you doing rolling--

1:03:14.549 --> 1:03:15.895
- Will Winston.

1:03:15.930 --> 1:03:18.587
- What? It's a legit question.

1:03:18.622 --> 1:03:19.416
- It's okay.

1:03:19.450 --> 1:03:20.279
- You don't have to answer that.

1:03:20.313 --> 1:03:21.383
- Unless of course you want to.

1:03:21.418 --> 1:03:22.246
- You don't.

1:03:22.281 --> 1:03:23.040
- It's totally okay.

1:03:25.525 --> 1:03:27.734
If you most know Mr. Nosy Pants,

1:03:27.769 --> 1:03:29.806
I was with someone recently.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:31.324
For a little over three years.

1:03:33.879 --> 1:03:34.776
- And?

1:03:35.984 --> 1:03:37.261
- And, it,

1:03:38.607 --> 1:03:39.436
just,

1:03:41.024 --> 1:03:42.232
sort of ended.

1:03:51.724 --> 1:03:54.727
- Well, you know, I'm
sure you'll meet

1:03:54.761 --> 1:03:56.729
the right guy when you're ready.

1:03:57.557 --> 1:03:58.386
- Yeah.

1:04:03.770 --> 1:04:05.669
- That being said, I
hate to leave you alone

1:04:05.703 --> 1:04:08.327
with this one, but nature calls.

1:04:14.954 --> 1:04:18.199

1:04:18.233 --> 1:04:20.132
[door closing]

1:04:20.166 --> 1:04:21.927
- Sorry if I was outta line.

1:04:21.961 --> 1:04:22.789
- You're fine.

1:04:25.068 --> 1:04:26.724
- Hey, you know what
they say about

1:04:26.759 --> 1:04:28.795
getting over somebody, right?

1:04:28.830 --> 1:04:30.659
- No, Will, what is it they say?

1:04:30.694 --> 1:04:32.730
- The only way to get
over somebody

1:04:32.765 --> 1:04:35.457
is to get under somebody else.

1:04:35.492 --> 1:04:36.700
- Oh.

1:04:36.734 --> 1:04:38.184
I'll keep that in mind.

1:04:38.219 --> 1:04:39.668
- Please do.

1:04:39.703 --> 1:04:42.326
Just don't tell Claire. She
doesn't have the same kinda

1:04:42.361 --> 1:04:43.914
sense of humor about
these things.

1:04:43.949 --> 1:04:45.329
- Oh, no.

1:04:45.364 --> 1:04:46.192
No need to worry.

1:04:47.297 --> 1:04:49.540
I'm good at keeping secrets.

1:04:49.575 --> 1:04:52.750

1:05:02.174 --> 1:05:05.556
[ominous dramatic music]

1:05:59.127 --> 1:06:00.577
- Hey.

1:06:00.611 --> 1:06:03.097
How's my
20-something-year-old stripper?

1:06:03.131 --> 1:06:04.132
- Stop.

1:06:04.167 --> 1:06:05.823
- Come on, I can think
of a lot better things

1:06:05.858 --> 1:06:07.135
to do than read right now.

1:06:07.170 --> 1:06:09.241
- You stop it.

1:06:09.275 --> 1:06:10.311
- What?

1:06:10.345 --> 1:06:11.208
- You know what.

1:06:12.934 --> 1:06:15.281
- Are you still upset
about what I asked Lisa?

1:06:17.421 --> 1:06:18.250
Seriously?

1:06:20.390 --> 1:06:21.839
Claire, she doesn't care.

1:06:23.427 --> 1:06:24.428
She doesn't.

1:06:26.016 --> 1:06:27.811
- You know, just
because she said that

1:06:27.845 --> 1:06:30.124
doesn't mean it's actually
how she feels, Will.

1:06:31.056 --> 1:06:33.990
- Claire, you're a sweet girl,
okay,

1:06:34.024 --> 1:06:35.198
which is why I love you so much

1:06:35.232 --> 1:06:38.132
but not everybody is as
sensitive about shit like you.

1:06:45.898 --> 1:06:47.693
I didn't mean to say
it like that.

1:06:47.727 --> 1:06:48.935
- What, like an asshole?

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:51.835
- Claire.

1:06:54.769 --> 1:06:56.253
Look.

1:06:56.288 --> 1:06:58.083
- Seriously, what is
it every time

1:06:58.117 --> 1:06:59.429
you get around her anyway?

1:07:00.809 --> 1:07:03.985
I mean, the comments and the
innuendos and the flirting,

1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:06.919
how do you think that
makes me feel seeing that?

1:07:06.953 --> 1:07:08.783
You know, and I know she
doesn't like it.

1:07:11.061 --> 1:07:13.512
- Claire, you don't think I'd
actually hurt you, do you?

1:07:13.546 --> 1:07:14.375
- I don't know.

1:07:15.721 --> 1:07:16.756
- Well, wait a second,
you actually think--

1:07:16.791 --> 1:07:18.344
- You know what, you
wait a second.

1:07:18.379 --> 1:07:19.966
In fact, why don't you
just go sleep on the couch

1:07:20.001 --> 1:07:22.107
since I'm so
sensitive about shit?

1:07:22.141 --> 1:07:22.969
- Claire.

1:07:26.387 --> 1:07:27.215
Seriously?

1:07:34.222 --> 1:07:35.672
Fine.

1:07:35.706 --> 1:07:36.535
Fuck it.

[ominous dramatic music]

1:08:44.603 --> 1:08:45.776
- Will.

1:08:45.811 --> 1:08:46.639
- Hey.

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:50.402
- Well good morning to you too,
Sunshine.

1:08:50.436 --> 1:08:52.024
- Sorry.

1:08:52.058 --> 1:08:52.887
How's it going?

1:08:53.750 --> 1:08:54.820
- Why the long face?

1:08:55.752 --> 1:08:56.960
- It's a long story.

1:08:59.894 --> 1:09:01.965
You look like you're up
to something fun

1:09:01.999 --> 1:09:03.277
and exciting this morning.

1:09:05.210 --> 1:09:06.211
- You have no idea.

1:09:09.041 --> 1:09:10.076
Do you think you
could help me move

1:09:10.111 --> 1:09:12.320
something in the storage
room really quickly?

1:09:15.323 --> 1:09:17.394
Please, it'll only take a
second, I swear.

1:09:19.085 --> 1:09:20.052
- Yeah, sure.

1:09:21.226 --> 1:09:23.055
- Thanks, you're the best.

1:09:23.089 --> 1:09:24.298
Right this way.

Aprez vous.

1:09:38.035 --> 1:09:39.865
It's right back there.

1:09:41.107 --> 1:09:43.869
[jacket zipping]

1:09:45.836 --> 1:09:47.769
Just this one thing.

1:09:47.804 --> 1:09:49.288
- What do you want me to do?

1:09:49.323 --> 1:09:50.531
- Die.

1:09:50.565 --> 1:09:52.188
[groaning]

1:09:52.222 --> 1:09:53.223
- Fuck.

1:09:53.258 --> 1:09:54.224
Fuck!

1:09:54.259 --> 1:09:56.985
[dramatic music]

1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:02.750
I'll fucking kill you.

1:10:41.789 --> 1:10:42.617

1:10:48.174 --> 1:10:49.003
Manager.

1:11:10.335 --> 1:11:11.232
Claire?

1:11:36.637 --> 1:11:37.948
- [Claire] Lisa.

1:11:37.983 --> 1:11:40.606
- Hey, you are here.

1:11:40.641 --> 1:11:42.470
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

1:11:43.471 --> 1:11:46.336
- Sorry, official manager stuff.

1:11:46.371 --> 1:11:49.408
The apartment above yours
was complaining

1:11:49.443 --> 1:11:52.308
about a water leak, so I
just came down to make sure

1:11:52.342 --> 1:11:55.103
it wasn't running down your
walls or on your ceiling.

1:11:56.242 --> 1:11:58.106
I knocked, but you must
not have heard me.

1:11:59.349 --> 1:12:03.077
- Yeah, I was sleeping, but
we haven't had any problems.

1:12:03.111 --> 1:12:04.492
- Yeah, looks good.

1:12:08.565 --> 1:12:10.671
Anyway, sorry if I woke you up.

1:12:20.853 --> 1:12:23.062
Hey, let me know if you
wanna grab coffee

1:12:23.097 --> 1:12:24.754
or something later
this afternoon.

1:12:26.203 --> 1:12:27.032
- Yeah, maybe.

1:12:28.136 --> 1:12:29.448
- [Lisa] Okay, take care.

1:13:37.378 --> 1:13:40.519
[soft dramatic music]

1:13:56.328 --> 1:13:59.642
- Character cannot be
developed in ease and quiet.

1:14:00.746 --> 1:14:05.302
Only through experience
of trial and suffering

1:14:05.337 --> 1:14:09.203
can the soul be strengthened,
ambition inspired

1:14:09.237 --> 1:14:10.791

1:14:22.147 --> 1:14:23.320
Hey, Claire, what's up?

1:14:25.633 --> 1:14:27.048
Okay, okay, wait, slow down.

1:14:28.878 --> 1:14:30.466
Okay, yeah, I'll be right up.

1:14:35.332 --> 1:14:36.472
Lisa is happy.

[knocking on door]

1:14:54.593 --> 1:14:56.871
Oh my God, are you okay,
what happened?

1:14:57.769 --> 1:14:59.874
- Have you seen Will today?

1:14:59.909 --> 1:15:02.636
- Yeah, I think I saw him
going out of the front door

1:15:02.670 --> 1:15:04.534
when I was in the office
this morning, why?

1:15:04.569 --> 1:15:05.639
- The front door?

1:15:05.673 --> 1:15:07.503
- Yeah, why, what happened?

1:15:09.263 --> 1:15:10.057
What is this?

1:15:10.091 --> 1:15:10.920
- Look at it.

1:15:13.163 --> 1:15:15.131
- [Lisa] It looks like
a credit card statement.

1:15:15.165 --> 1:15:16.960
- Yeah, from an account
I've never seen before.

1:15:16.995 --> 1:15:19.204
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm just confused.

1:15:19.238 --> 1:15:21.068
Tell me what happened, honey.

1:15:22.345 --> 1:15:25.210
- Last night, Will and I
got in a fight

1:15:25.244 --> 1:15:29.421
over something stupid, and I
made him sleep on the couch.

1:15:29.455 --> 1:15:31.216
- Okay, that happens sometimes.

1:15:31.250 --> 1:15:32.907
- No, it's never
happened with us.

1:15:34.184 --> 1:15:37.498
And then I get up this
morning and then, you're here,

1:15:37.533 --> 1:15:40.605
but okay, whatever,
fine, and then you leave

1:15:40.639 --> 1:15:44.194
and I got my tea and I
checked my email

1:15:44.229 --> 1:15:47.059
and I got an email that
I got the part.

1:15:47.094 --> 1:15:48.129
- What?

1:15:48.164 --> 1:15:50.649
- The role of Gemini, I
got the part.

1:15:50.684 --> 1:15:53.997
- Oh my God, Claire, that's
amazing. That's so amazing.

1:15:54.032 --> 1:15:56.172
- No, because then I found this.

1:15:57.069 --> 1:15:58.174
- I don't understand.

1:15:58.208 --> 1:16:00.417
What does that have to do
with you getting the role?

1:16:01.349 --> 1:16:02.247
- Don't you see what's on here?

1:16:02.281 --> 1:16:04.421
There's lingerie, and
there's jewelry

1:16:04.456 --> 1:16:07.045
and then there's
plane tickets too.

1:16:07.079 --> 1:16:08.080
[crying]

1:16:08.115 --> 1:16:09.254
- It's okay, it's okay.

1:16:09.288 --> 1:16:12.222
- Will just, he found someone
else and he just left me.

1:16:12.257 --> 1:16:14.535
- No, Claire, no. That
didn't happen.

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.261
- Yes he did [cries].

1:16:16.295 --> 1:16:18.884
And I've been calling his
cellphone since I found this,

1:16:18.919 --> 1:16:20.817
and it doesn't even go
to voicemail.

1:16:20.852 --> 1:16:24.856
And I called his office, too,
and they haven't seen him.

1:16:24.890 --> 1:16:27.652
And his car's downstairs
but he's not here,

1:16:27.686 --> 1:16:29.550
and you said you saw him leave.

1:16:30.862 --> 1:16:33.174
- Yeah, but I'm sure
that doesn't mean.

1:16:33.209 --> 1:16:34.659
Claire, Claire, Claire.

1:16:34.693 --> 1:16:36.212
[crying]

1:16:36.246 --> 1:16:37.075
It's okay.

1:16:38.352 --> 1:16:39.180
It's okay, honey.

1:16:40.699 --> 1:16:42.218
It's okay.

1:16:42.252 --> 1:16:43.599
- I've lost him.

1:16:43.633 --> 1:16:47.016
- No, no, Claire. You did not.

1:16:47.050 --> 1:16:49.915
If he left, he's the one who's
lost, do you understand me?

1:16:51.158 --> 1:16:52.435
Claire, Claire.

1:16:53.850 --> 1:16:58.579
You are kind and beautiful
and smart and talented.

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:01.271
A true artist. Anybody
would be lucky to have you.

1:17:03.446 --> 1:17:04.585
I'm lucky to have you.

1:17:06.691 --> 1:17:07.623
- What do you mean?

1:17:09.176 --> 1:17:10.764
- You know what I mean, Claire.

1:17:12.731 --> 1:17:15.009
And if he left us together,
it's for a reason.

1:17:17.667 --> 1:17:18.495
Claire.

1:17:21.533 --> 1:17:22.879
- I think you should go.

1:17:22.914 --> 1:17:23.708
- [Lisa] Claire.

1:17:24.709 --> 1:17:26.849
- I need you to
leave now please.

1:17:26.883 --> 1:17:27.919
- [Lisa] Claire, don't
deny what you feel.

1:17:27.953 --> 1:17:30.404
- Lisa, I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:17:30.438 --> 1:17:32.026
- Don't say that, Claire.

1:17:33.407 --> 1:17:35.651
- Lisa, I'm sorry, I don't--

1:17:35.685 --> 1:17:37.963
- Don't say that.

1:17:37.998 --> 1:17:38.930
- Lisa.

1:17:38.964 --> 1:17:40.828
- Don't Lisa me.

1:17:40.863 --> 1:17:43.210
After everything I've
done for you.

1:17:43.244 --> 1:17:45.177
After I let you have the
role of Gemini,

1:17:45.212 --> 1:17:47.179
don't you fucking dare.

1:17:47.214 --> 1:17:48.802
I gave you a home.

1:17:48.836 --> 1:17:50.907
- Lisa, you're scaring me.

1:17:52.115 --> 1:17:53.358
- I'm scaring you.

1:17:54.221 --> 1:17:55.049
Why?

1:17:55.912 --> 1:17:57.396
Because you fear
being truly loved

1:17:57.431 --> 1:17:59.467
by somebody who would
never leave you?

1:18:00.503 --> 1:18:03.092
Somebody who
recognizes your talent,

1:18:03.126 --> 1:18:05.128
somebody who
understands your beauty?

1:18:06.129 --> 1:18:07.890
Somebody who is your soulmate.

1:18:09.823 --> 1:18:12.204
[struggling]

1:18:13.516 --> 1:18:14.690
- Lisa, don't.

1:18:15.656 --> 1:18:18.797
[soft dramatic music]

1:18:20.005 --> 1:18:22.249
[groaning]

1:18:26.115 --> 1:18:28.531
- Oh no, no no, no no no, no.

1:18:29.877 --> 1:18:32.121
[groaning]

1:18:39.473 --> 1:18:40.301
- Why?

1:18:45.272 --> 1:18:46.687
- Lisa is lonely.

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:54.074
But you can't help her now.

1:18:57.629 --> 1:18:59.873
[gurgling]

1:19:11.229 --> 1:19:13.507
[gurgling]

1:19:49.681 --> 1:19:53.305
Lisa is smart.

1:19:53.340 --> 1:19:54.824
Lisa can fix this.

1:20:02.521 --> 1:20:03.522
Lisa is sad.

1:20:09.459 --> 1:20:10.460
Lisa is sad.

1:20:13.739 --> 1:20:17.053
[inhaling and exhaling]

1:20:20.367 --> 1:20:21.368
Lisa is sad.

1:20:35.209 --> 1:20:36.038
I'm sorry.

1:20:41.457 --> 1:20:44.356
[soft piano music]

1:20:51.191 --> 1:20:52.019
I'm sorry.

1:20:55.816 --> 1:20:56.644
I'm sorry.

1:21:02.788 --> 1:21:04.860
[crying]

1:21:13.109 --> 1:21:16.043
Please come quick. Somebody has
been stabbed in my building.

1:21:19.184 --> 1:21:21.980
Tinseltown Villa Apartments,
I'm the on-site manager.

1:21:24.603 --> 1:21:26.226
Yeah, please come quick [cries].

1:21:33.750 --> 1:21:36.512
[pen scribbling]

1:21:39.239 --> 1:21:40.792
- [Lisa] Now, before we
go any further,

1:21:40.826 --> 1:21:43.415
by California law, I do
need to inform you

1:21:43.450 --> 1:21:46.039
and have you sign a form
acknowledging that you know

1:21:46.073 --> 1:21:48.973
that somebody did die in the
apartment that you're renting

1:21:49.007 --> 1:21:50.388
within the last three years.

1:21:52.528 --> 1:21:53.943
- Are you serious?

1:21:53.978 --> 1:21:55.048
- [Lisa] I'm afraid so.

1:21:55.980 --> 1:21:58.051
- That's really a law
in California?

1:21:58.085 --> 1:21:59.397
- [Lisa] Crazy but true.

1:22:02.262 --> 1:22:03.090
- How'd they die?

1:22:04.678 --> 1:22:06.197
- [Lisa] You really wanna know?

1:22:09.096 --> 1:22:13.445
Well, they were a young
couple, moved here from Texas

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:15.861
so that she could pursue
acting, much like you wanna do.

1:22:17.139 --> 1:22:20.349
And one morning, management
needed to check on a building

1:22:20.383 --> 1:22:25.319
issue in their apartment,
and she was lying there,

1:22:25.354 --> 1:22:26.596
stabbed in the chest.

1:22:28.046 --> 1:22:28.874
- Oh my God.

1:22:30.635 --> 1:22:31.981
- Did they know who did it?

1:22:33.914 --> 1:22:36.123
- [Lisa] They suspect the
husband because he disappeared

1:22:36.158 --> 1:22:38.574
the same day, but nobody's
seen him since.

1:22:41.335 --> 1:22:43.475
Obviously, this is the first
time anything like this

1:22:43.510 --> 1:22:47.134
has ever happened, but I am
required by law to tell you.

1:22:50.413 --> 1:22:51.759
- What do you think, honey?

1:22:54.245 --> 1:22:56.074
- It's not haunted, is it?

1:22:56.109 --> 1:22:57.110
- Not that I know of.

1:22:58.974 --> 1:23:00.734
- Hey, everyone dies.

1:23:01.873 --> 1:23:04.013
Not everyone can get a
one-bedroom at this price.

1:23:04.048 --> 1:23:04.876
Am I right?

1:23:07.603 --> 1:23:09.432
- [Trina] You'll have
to forgive him.

1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:20.512
- Great, well that's it then.

1:23:20.547 --> 1:23:22.583
It's ready to move in
whenever you guys would like.

1:23:23.791 --> 1:23:27.450
Oh, I totally forgot to get
you a shower curtain rod.

1:23:27.485 --> 1:23:29.211
I'll get that this afternoon,
okay?

1:23:32.110 --> 1:23:33.594
Welcome to Tinseltown Villa.

1:23:53.338 --> 1:23:56.721
[elevator whirring]

1:23:56.755 --> 1:23:59.931
[soft dramatic music]

1:24:08.871 --> 1:24:11.943
[elevator whirring]

1:24:11.977 --> 1:24:15.119
[soft dramatic music]

1:24:25.543 --> 1:24:28.477
[elevator whirring]

1:24:28.511 --> 1:24:31.618
