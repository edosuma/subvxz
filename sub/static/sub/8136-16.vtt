00:25.959 --> 00:27.586
It's Black Beauty.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.753
Shh. That's our secret.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.660
Let's lose
the welcoming committee.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.558
How is she?

00:34.634 --> 00:35.623
She's so pale.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.296
You can save her life
and I can save yours.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.804
So what've you got?
A tank?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.135
Close the door, man.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.536
They're gonna
rip me apart.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.372
I'm afraid
it's hopeless, Michael.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.139
We're talkin' about
Becky's life here.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.044
This is the police.
Throw out your weapons

00:48.114 --> 00:49.877
and come out
with your hands up.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.884
This is gonna be
an "E" ticket ride.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.265
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:08.335 --> 01:10.166
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.303 --> 01:12.134
who does not exist.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.403
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.480 --> 01:23.313
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.383 --> 01:25.442
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.518 --> 01:28.715
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.801
We just ran a red light.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.573
It's okay, honey.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.047
Ambulances are
allowed to do that.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.016
How do you feel?

02:32.252 --> 02:35.085
I feel better now.
Honest.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.620
Uh, vital signs stable.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.522
Patient is conscious
and alert.

02:39.592 --> 02:40.923
Temperature's elevated.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.655
We've drawn blood
for cross match.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.425
Have three units of O
Negative standing by.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.259
Am I gonna need
transfusions again?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.737
Yes, honey.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.371
It's worse this time,
isn't it?

02:57.677 --> 03:00.805
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.795
She got sick on vacation

03:59.873 --> 04:01.966
and the medication
they gave her isn't working.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.936
It was their
first vacation in...

04:04.010 --> 04:05.409
Hey, she's tough.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.503
She's your niece,
isn't she?

04:07.680 --> 04:08.669
She'll make it.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.474
How's Laura?

04:10.550 --> 04:13.713
Well, she was pretty torn up
when she talked with Devon.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.685
Since her husband died,
Becky's been her whole life.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.584
April, you gotta
hang in there.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.755
They're both
gonna need you.

04:24.364 --> 04:27.026
Look at me. I didn't
even take time to change.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.931
April, you look fine.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.070
April, tell Becky
I'm pulling for her.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.669
I will.

04:50.723 --> 04:55.092
Dr. Adler wanted
in Surgery. Dr. Adler wanted in Surgery.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.455
Dr. Jackson,
Treatment Room 1, stat.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.727
Dr. Jackson,
Treatment Room 1, stat.

05:02.268 --> 05:03.428
How's she doing?

05:03.503 --> 05:05.232
Not too well,
I'm afraid.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.201
Michael,
thanks for being here.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.674
That's what family is for.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.210
She's been asking
for you and KITT.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.370
KITT's outside.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.505
Doctor, what is it?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.172
It's, uh, pneumonia.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.081
Somebody
prescribed an antibiotic

05:19.152 --> 05:21.780
without knowing her
history of aplastic anemia,

05:22.188 --> 05:25.089
and it's wiping out her
white cells and bone marrow.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.026
Right now she couldn't even
fight off a common cold.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.824
Which means what,
exactly?

05:31.231 --> 05:33.722
There could be
other complications.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.570
In 36 to 48 hours we may have
to do a marrow transplant.

05:37.737 --> 05:38.999
Transplant?

05:39.806 --> 05:41.535
That's always been an option.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.338
But I'm afraid this time
we may have no alternative.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.843
Then let me be the donor.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.213
Mrs. Phillips, our records
indicate Becky was adopted.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.840
What about one of us?

05:51.818 --> 05:54.184
We'll do a tissue typing
on all of you.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.621
Uh, right now, we're trying
for a computer matchup.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.856
It's a complicated process,

05:59.926 --> 06:02.258
and sometimes our computers
aren't always aware

06:02.328 --> 06:04.455
of the urgency
of our human needs.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.729
It's gonna take some time.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.266
May we see her now?

06:08.334 --> 06:10.598
Well, yes, she's right
down the hall in 211.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.262
Thank you.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.379
Hi, sweetheart.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.747
Aunt April.
Michael. Hi!

06:25.818 --> 06:27.115
Hi, honey.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.882
We rode in an ambulance,
and we ran a red light.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.547
Ooh!
No kidding.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.592
Was the ambulance
faster than KITT?

06:33.660 --> 06:36.857
Well, maybe.
But not as nice.

06:37.864 --> 06:38.990
Is he here?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.657
He sure is. Hey, KITT.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.792
I got somebody
who wants to talk to you.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.064
Becky? Can you hear me?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.705
Here you go, honey.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.400
It's Black Beauty.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.636
Shh. That's our secret.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.006
It's good to hear your voice.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.579
How are you feeling?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.175
Well, I get a little spinny.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.681
You just rest and get better so
you can come riding with us again.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.846
All right.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.254
Michael. Michael,
may I have a word please?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.087
Yeah.
I'll be back, honey.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.218
Okay.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.697
Aunt April, how come you're
wearin' those clothes?

07:14.934 --> 07:16.026
Yeah, what is it?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.502
Our computer's down. We
can't get through to I.R.M.A.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.663
I.R.M.A.?

07:19.739 --> 07:21.730
Interstate Research
and Medical Assistance.

07:21.808 --> 07:22.832
It's our database.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.001
How long?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.203
Whatever time it takes.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.643
Dr. Kiley, we don't have the time.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.874
You got a hard copy
on Becky's condition?

07:34.654 --> 07:37.555
Michael, I wish there
was something I could do.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.592
There is, KITT.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.956
This is Becky's file.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.518
We need to contact
a computer named I.R.M.A

07:43.630 --> 07:45.894
that's got the records
on suitable donors.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.430
I.R.M.A. say no more.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.181
This is the synthesized voice

08:10.290 --> 08:13.521
of Interstate Research
and Medical Assistance.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.056
Welcome to I.R.M.A.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.626
Indicate desired information.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.359
Wow!
Get a load of that voice.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.457
Please repeat.

08:21.534 --> 08:22.626
Never mind.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.034
This is Knight Industries
Two Thousand requesting

08:25.104 --> 08:27.368
donor match for
bone marrow transplant.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.102
I'm transmitting
tissue typing data now.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.770
Receiving
data. Check sums correct.

08:34.681 --> 08:39.118
Accessing data files:
bone marrow transplant.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.381
Scanning data for
donor type match.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.490
Stand by for data transfer.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.492
I don't know why they can't give

08:47.560 --> 08:48.822
those machines
a little more...

08:48.895 --> 08:49.884
Pizzazz?

08:49.996 --> 08:51.293
Exactly.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.559
Ah, she's just not
your type, buddy.

08:59.772 --> 09:00.830
Any luck?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.374
Yes and no.
She's a very rare tissue type.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.468
But there were three possible
donors in the computer.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.512
Good!

09:06.579 --> 09:07.568
No, it's not so good.

09:07.647 --> 09:11.083
One died recently and another is out
of the country and can't be reached.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.276
And the third?

09:12.352 --> 09:15.719
The third. He has a name and
address, but no phone is listed.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.119
What can we do?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.781
It's only a few hundred miles.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.052
Look, I'm out of here.
You tell Becky I love her.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.597
Dr. Jackson, Treatment
Room 1. Dr. Jackson, Treatment Room 1.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.699
Dr. Mendes, Receiving Room...

09:29.769 --> 09:31.168
Godspeed, Michael.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.206
This business of family
seems pretty complicated, Michael.

09:43.282 --> 09:44.510
Well, it can be.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.451
You see, family isn't just
people who you're related to.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.488
Family can be
people who love you,

09:49.555 --> 09:51.216
people who care about you.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.892
It doesn't matter how
you know each other.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.858
Some friends
are like family, KITT.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.056
Even though Becky is adopted,
she's still April's niece.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.156
That's right.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.497
I'm afraid I still
find it a bit confusing.

10:02.568 --> 10:05.298
Take Devon and April
and you and me.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.166
We're like a family,
aren't we?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.935
By your definition, yes.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.373
See what I mean, partner?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.740
Thank you, Michael.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.110
All right, KITT.
Let's check out that donor.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.512
Right away, Michael.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.915
Julio Rodriguez. Age 23.

10:20.987 --> 10:24.115
Height: 5'10",
Weight: 165 pounds.

10:29.595 --> 10:32.120
Now all we
have to do is find Julio.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.275
This is the street, Michael.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.842
748.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.354
It's in the next block.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.391
Okay, right up here somewhere.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.232
I don't see any 748, Michael.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.696
Maybe it's in the back. Huh?

11:23.282 --> 11:24.874
Now you keep
your scanners peeled.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.145
Yes, Michael.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.718
Excuse me.
I'm looking for 748.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.017
Not on this street.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.889
I'm 746,
then it goes to 50.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.394
Yeah, well, I'm lookin' for
a guy named Julio Rodriguez.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.829
It's very important.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.230
Don't know him.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.664
Well, he's from this
neighborhood, isn't he?

11:45.738 --> 11:47.228
Neighborhood?

11:48.007 --> 11:50.237
It used to be a neighborhood.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.107
You been here long?

11:52.178 --> 11:53.440
Long enough.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.646
Look, mister, I'm busy.

11:56.849 --> 11:59.909
Excuse me, but a little
girl's life is at stake here.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.790
I knew Julio
when he was little.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.553
I knew his people.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.417
I don't know him anymore.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.929
He's with a gang.
Los Vengadores.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.593
Last week they fought with the
Conquerors from the south side.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.365
Julio was knifed,
and their leader was

12:18.437 --> 12:20.905
taken to the hospital
with a bullet in him.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.372
He could die.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.604
Did Julio shoot him?

12:35.154 --> 12:37.213
Please, tell me
where I can find Julio.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.756
I don't know where he is.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.758
Maybe he's a Conqueror.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.820
Michael, I think we have company.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.868
All right, let's lose
the welcoming committee. Huh?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.535
Hey, old man!

13:26.973 --> 13:28.702
What did he want?

13:28.774 --> 13:30.366
He was asking about Julio,

13:30.443 --> 13:32.434
but I didn't
tell him anything.

13:32.511 --> 13:34.308
I don't get involved.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.605
Yeah, well,
that's okay...

13:37.016 --> 13:38.916
'Cause we get involved.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.380
I give up. I give up.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.146
This is worse than the
charge of the Light Brigade.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.387
You wanna play again?

14:16.455 --> 14:18.252
I'll let you win this time.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.120
Charity begins at home.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.625
Not on the checkerboard.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.924
No, young lady,
I know when I'm outclassed.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.357
Hello?

14:28.434 --> 14:31.801
Devon, it's
me, Michael. How's Becky?

14:31.871 --> 14:35.739
Well, apart from the fact that she
has no regard whatever for her elders,

14:35.808 --> 14:37.070
she's in top form, Michael.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.337
Can I talk to him?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.606
In a moment.
How are things going?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.444
Not good.
The address was a phony.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.311
The donor turns out to be
a guy who's wanted

14:46.385 --> 14:48.114
for shooting the leader
of a rival gang.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.687
He's hiding out somewhere.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.620
Splendid.
That's good news, Michael.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.659
Devon, did you hear me right?

14:54.093 --> 14:56.561
It could take days
to locate this guy.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.027
If he's still alive.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.155
I see.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.062
Well, uh,
that sounds very promising.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.691
Uh, Becky's right here,
Michael.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.225
She wants a word with you.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.203
Okay, I hear you.

15:06.872 --> 15:10.399
Just so you know,
I'm not gonna give up.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.104
Of course not.
And I appreciate it, Michael.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.646
Here's Becky.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.640
Michael,
when are you comin' back?

15:18.718 --> 15:20.379
Soon, sweetheart.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.111
I'm just taking care
of a few things.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.552
Hello, Becky.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.953
KITT.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.123
Your lesson
in checkers paid off.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.157
Devon never knew
what hit him.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.494
When I see you again,

15:34.567 --> 15:36.501
I'll give you
a few pointers on chess.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.365
KITT and I got to
go now, sweetheart.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.065
We'll see you real soon.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.630
Okay. Bye.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.334
Thank you.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.908
Now, young lady.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.106
I think I've
changed my mind.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.443
Let's have another go.

15:50.516 --> 15:51.710
All right.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.557
Michael,
there's a car following us.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.190
Shall we lose it?

16:09.034 --> 16:12.094
Whoever it is must be as
interested in Julio as we are.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.661
How are we gonna
talk to him?

16:13.739 --> 16:16.207
Polite introductions don't
seem in vogue around here.

16:16.275 --> 16:17.367
KITT.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.510
You're about to be the cheese
in a big black mousetrap.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.912
A somewhat
unpleasant metaphor.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.780
Not if it works.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.605
Hi, want some licorice?

17:24.844 --> 17:26.310
Who are you?

17:26.377 --> 17:27.742
Let's get moving, KITT.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.852
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
Hey, what are you doin'?

17:34.153 --> 17:36.644
Stop it. Who's drivin' the car? Stop it.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.120
Come on.
What's goin' on here?

17:38.190 --> 17:40.021
That's what
I'd like to find out.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.287
Ever since I hit town, you've
fallen in love with my car.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.692
Why is that?

17:43.762 --> 17:45.059
Uh, stuff it, chum.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.995
Maybe it's because
you're more interested

17:47.066 --> 17:49.000
in lookin' out for your
buddy Julio Rodriguez.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.399
I don't know him.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.096
He's a Vengador,
isn't he?

17:52.204 --> 17:53.728
W-Where we going?

17:53.806 --> 17:56.240
How about we take a little
scenic drive, you know?

17:56.308 --> 17:59.243
Across the bridge into
the Conquerors' territory.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.142
No way. They'll kill me.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.737
Then where's Julio?

18:02.781 --> 18:04.510
Come on, man.
What are you tryin' to do?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.278
I'm trying to save
a little girl's life.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.614
What's that got
to do with me?

18:07.686 --> 18:08.710
I need your help.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.015
I know Julio
is a brother.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.384
I figure you know
where he is.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.822
No way, man.
I ain't telling you that.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.087
All right.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.788
Just sit back
and enjoy the view.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.667
Hey, man. Hey,
man. Those are Conquerors.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.609
This looks good, KITT.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.874
Come on, get
me out of here, man.

18:48.193 --> 18:51.162
They saw me, man.
Get me out of here.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.657
I need five minutes
of Julio's time.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.258
Just to talk.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.099
Close the door, man.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.162
They're gonna rip me apart.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.434
Where's Julio?

19:09.615 --> 19:11.480
Okay. Okay.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.811
I'll take you to him.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.080
But I gotta make
a phone call first.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.950
Just close the door!

19:17.690 --> 19:19.681
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.796
You hear what he said?
He knows where Julio is.

19:27.866 --> 19:28.924
Let's go.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.185
He's in there?

19:49.288 --> 19:51.256
Like I told you.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.041
Wait in
the confessional.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.384
Julio?

20:55.487 --> 20:56.715
What do you want?

20:56.822 --> 20:58.187
To help you.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.588
Who says I need help?

20:59.658 --> 21:01.421
The cops
are lookin' for you.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.586
The Conquerors
are lookin' for you.

21:03.662 --> 21:07.393
Now, it's just a matter of time,
and you're fresh out of choices.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.927
So? What can you do?

21:10.335 --> 21:11.768
I can get you out.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.328
Oh, yeah? What are you?
Some kind of magician?

21:14.406 --> 21:17.170
No, I work for the Foundation
for Law and Government.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.506
Julio, there's a little girl
who's dying.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.478
Now, I need you to come with me.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.374
You can save her life, man.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.007
And I can save yours.

21:25.584 --> 21:28.212
And what do you think I am,
some kind of doctor?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.779
There's no way, man, I'm not moving
from here until the heat settles.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.881
Michael, I'm
picking up the approach

21:33.992 --> 21:36.017
of two vans from
the Lanark area.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.389
Who's that?

21:38.464 --> 21:39.829
That's a friend outside.

21:39.898 --> 21:40.956
Lanark area.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.762
That's the Conquerors'
territory.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.376
Hey, the Conquerors
are outside, man.

21:52.444 --> 21:53.604
Do we take them?

21:53.679 --> 21:55.237
They're after you, Julio.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.542
Why risk the others?

21:57.282 --> 21:59.375
Julio, please.
Listen to him.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.483
We've got plans, right?

22:01.587 --> 22:03.487
But they're
no good if you're dead.

22:03.789 --> 22:06.451
The last thing we need
now is more trouble.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.485
So what've you got?
A tank?

22:10.762 --> 22:12.389
It's close to it.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.298
All right,
I'll go with you.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.198
But just to cool this place out.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.168
No fighting.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.227
Yeah, but...

22:20.305 --> 22:22.034
Do what I tell you.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.135
Come on, let's go.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.410
KITT, pick us up in the alley.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.697
Jump in. Come on.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.475
Company.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.448
We have room to turbo?

23:12.558 --> 23:14.958
Negative, Michael.
There's not enough distance.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.358
Hey, what's goin' on, man?

23:16.428 --> 23:18.521
I thought you said
you could get me out of here.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.963
KITT, give me
all the power you got.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.044
Hold on, Julio.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.714
You okay?

23:42.821 --> 23:44.254
What was that?

23:44.523 --> 23:45.615
You're okay.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.366
We've lost them, Michael.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.967
That's what it's all about.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.276
Hey, what is this,
you got some guy

24:08.347 --> 24:10.144
back at the shop
you talkin' to?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.250
No. I got a computer
right here.

24:12.317 --> 24:15.445
Julio, meet KITT.
KITT's part of the family.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.248
Thank you, Michael.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.846
Oh, man. This is crazy.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.056
So... so what happens now?

24:22.127 --> 24:25.528
I told you, there's a sick
little girl who needs your help.

24:25.597 --> 24:26.962
Why me?

24:27.065 --> 24:28.657
Because you're compatible.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.792
What?

24:29.901 --> 24:31.493
You're a good donor.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.435
Oh, you mean,
like blood, right?

24:34.406 --> 24:35.998
More or less, yeah.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.474
Hey, I don't know.

24:40.512 --> 24:42.446
You've got somethin'
better to do?

24:42.681 --> 24:44.740
Not right now.

24:44.816 --> 24:45.805
Okay.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.912
Get me Devon, pal.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.246
Yes, Mr. Miles.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.656
Thank you. Michael?

24:57.796 --> 24:59.388
That's wonderful news,
Michael.

24:59.464 --> 25:01.489
Congratulations.
I knew you could do it.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.828
I'll tell the others.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.028
He's found the donor.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.366
Yes, and he's bringing him
straight to the hospital.

25:06.438 --> 25:09.635
Of course, there's still the little
matter of convincing him to do it,

25:09.708 --> 25:10.834
but I believe he can.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.377
I'm beginning to believe
a lot of things again.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.465
Laura. Hey, sis.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.265
I finally got her to sleep.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.205
Yes, and you, too, I see.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.066
What are you reading?

25:45.143 --> 25:46.610
Fredrick the Frog.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.307
Oh, yes. The one about
the frog who has no friends

25:50.382 --> 25:52.612
except his own reflection
in the pond.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.049
See, I remember.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.417
Hey, come outside
for a minute.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.854
Michael's
bringing the donor.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.861
Oh, thank God.

26:11.002 --> 26:12.697
What's wrong, sis?

26:13.605 --> 26:15.505
Just before she fell asleep,

26:16.908 --> 26:19.308
she said that
sometimes she feels

26:19.378 --> 26:21.778
like she's never
gonna get better.

26:22.948 --> 26:25.246
Sometimes she gets so tired,

26:25.784 --> 26:28.776
like she stayed up
past her bedtime,

26:29.921 --> 26:31.912
only it's still afternoon.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.424
You listen to me.

26:34.493 --> 26:38.190
There are so many people who
love Becky and who care about her.

26:38.864 --> 26:40.525
She's bound to get well.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.049
Sooner or later they've got
to stop for gas or something.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.350
We'll find them.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.651
We better.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.951
After all the trouble we went through
to catch our little prize here.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.655
It'd be a shame if Julio
didn't get to see it.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.063
Swordfish
to Ramrod. Do you read me?

27:15.133 --> 27:16.964
I read you. Go ahead.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.864
Ric. I, uh...

27:20.005 --> 27:21.029
Listen.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.470
Come on, man. What is it?

27:22.541 --> 27:23.735
It's Jimmy.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.102
What about him?

27:25.210 --> 27:26.643
He didn't make it.

27:26.711 --> 27:27.769
Damn!

27:27.846 --> 27:29.905
Come on, man. That's not
gonna get us anywhere.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.814
What do you care?
He was my brother.

27:33.452 --> 27:37.115
Look, man, I know what'll get
us somewhere when we find them.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.715
Her.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.444
Go ahead. I bought it for Santos.

28:07.752 --> 28:09.913
You want to talk
about the shooting?

28:11.089 --> 28:13.080
Hey, what's to tell, man?

28:13.258 --> 28:15.385
You heat up,
you get a little fried.

28:16.228 --> 28:19.356
You're nervous. You've
got all this energy, see.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.365
You got no place to put it.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.562
What was the beef about?

28:24.236 --> 28:26.966
We were on their turf, man.
That's enough.

28:28.139 --> 28:29.538
I was up front.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.338
We heard the cops comin'.

28:32.410 --> 28:36.005
I started runnin', then this
dude Jimmy stuck me from behind.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.809
Well, the next thing
I knew I heard a pop.

28:39.417 --> 28:42.113
I turned around
and he was down.

28:42.687 --> 28:45.588
So because this
dude Jimmy knifed you,

28:45.991 --> 28:47.959
everybody thinks
you shot him?

28:48.493 --> 28:51.155
Hey, when someone buys
it in the street,

28:51.229 --> 28:53.390
you've got to put
the finger somewhere.

28:53.698 --> 28:56.166
Otherwise, you got no place
to put all the anger.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.259
Why don't you put it
on the truth?

28:58.336 --> 28:59.826
You make up
the truth out there

28:59.938 --> 29:01.462
just like you
make up the justice.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.304
Yeah, right.
Look where it got you.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.902
Hey, what am I doing here?

29:08.179 --> 29:10.238
I don't even like licorice.

29:36.341 --> 29:40.277
Michael, we have a problem.
There's a roadblock up ahead.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.016
Cops. I knew it.
Let me out of the car.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.247
Stay cool. I'll find
out what's happening.

29:50.989 --> 29:52.456
Keep an eye on him, KITT.

29:58.897 --> 30:02.025
You can pick
up 120 to the side, okay?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.590
What's the trouble?

30:03.668 --> 30:06.262
Well, the road's washed out
up ahead from the storm.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.000
We gotta reroute traffic.
All traffic west of here.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.099
Come on, move it out.
Come on.

30:11.176 --> 30:12.541
Look, I got an emergency here.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.635
I'm sorry.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.339
Let's go.
Let's go.

30:16.881 --> 30:17.870
All right.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.782
Julio! They got Terri.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.104
No, Julio! Come back here.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.769
I can't let you
through this road. Okay?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.102
Thanks, anyway.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.168
Michael.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.441
Yeah, KITT. What is it?

30:50.515 --> 30:52.949
I'm afraid
Julio's getting away.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.817
What happened?

30:55.987 --> 30:57.978
He found the roof button.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.453
Michael, I feel just awful.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.795
That's all right.
Let's get him back.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.731
I'm afraid
we have another problem.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.965
I see what you mean.

31:35.326 --> 31:36.554
There she is.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.227
What do we do now?

31:42.600 --> 31:45.160
They don't want you.
They want me.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.677
If you want me,
let him through.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.175
Let him through.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.649
Santos.
But...

32:02.821 --> 32:04.448
Santos. Do it.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.092
Yeah, yeah,
get out of here.

32:37.322 --> 32:38.880
You couldn't reach Michael?

32:38.990 --> 32:41.117
We're not reaching anything
on KITT's frequency.

32:41.226 --> 32:44.718
It seems there's an electrical
storm between here and Cedar City.

32:44.829 --> 32:48.060
Of course, it is possible that
they could walk in here any minute.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.760
God, I hope so.

32:51.336 --> 32:52.496
How is she?

32:52.570 --> 32:54.094
She's resting.

32:54.439 --> 32:57.101
But her breathing is so
shallow, and she's so pale.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.034
Is there any word?

33:00.178 --> 33:01.907
No. Nothing new.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.119
I still can't believe
that traffic jam, Michael.

33:19.230 --> 33:22.393
Yeah. First Times Square,
and now no sign of anything.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.560
Including Julio
and his sidekick.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.193
Michael,
I'm getting something.

33:26.271 --> 33:30.173
Two vehicles approaching a
large structure 0.6 miles east.

33:30.275 --> 33:33.108
All right, let's go for it.
It's our only shot.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.023
Come on, come on.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.898
Get him in. Come on.
Let's go. Hurry up.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.268
Get in there.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.583
There it is, Michael.
And there are those vans.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.630
Michael, there are seven
of them.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.101
Five are armed.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.534
Not very good odds, huh?

34:33.605 --> 34:34.629
I agree.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.656
You know, there's one
good thing about this.

34:56.828 --> 34:59.296
It's gonna hurt you
a lot more than it hurt Jimmy.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.889
I don't like it, man.
Burnin' them like that.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.334
He was your brother,
remember?

35:08.539 --> 35:10.404
Okay, KITT. Do your stuff.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.476
You in there. This is the police.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.611
Throw out your weapons and
come out with your hands up.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.765
You have one minute.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.631
You're completely surrounded.

35:41.706 --> 35:44.573
Throw out your weapons and
come out with your hands up.

35:54.285 --> 35:57.482
Throw out your weapons and
come out with your hands up.

35:57.588 --> 35:59.488
You're completely surrounded.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.616
They got an army out there.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.354
We got a better
army right here.

36:04.429 --> 36:07.227
You crazy?
Those are cops.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.997
You have 30 seconds.
This is the police.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.766
All right, we're coming out.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.898
All right, men.
Hold your fire.

36:18.242 --> 36:19.539
Get over there.

36:19.610 --> 36:20.634
Be cool.

36:20.712 --> 36:21.736
Come on. Drop it.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.872
Over there.
Next to him. Come on.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.916
Get over there.

36:26.484 --> 36:27.849
Get over there.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.189
Everybody out.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.031
All right, hotshot.
Call off your army.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.431
No army, Ric. Just him.

36:46.904 --> 36:49.395
It's just a little floorshow
for your benefit.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.303
Get rid of the gun,
funny man.

36:54.178 --> 36:55.338
Do it!

36:57.215 --> 36:59.410
Michael, his pulse
rate and adrenalin flow

36:59.484 --> 37:01.418
indicate a highly
agitated state.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.119
I suggest you comply.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.688
What the hell is that?

37:04.756 --> 37:05.984
His car.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.385
You gonna hide
behind that girl,

37:11.562 --> 37:13.894
or you're gonna
get it on like a man?

37:13.965 --> 37:15.364
That's real cute.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.027
But the man is the one
with the hardware, sucker.

37:28.312 --> 37:29.404
Tony.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.615
All right, everybody.
Let's get inside. Come on.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.099
All right.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.401
Nobody has
anything else to say here,

37:54.472 --> 37:55.700
so let's
just get on with it.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.762
The girl, too?

37:56.841 --> 37:57.865
What do you think?

37:57.942 --> 37:59.273
I've got
somethin' to say.

37:59.343 --> 38:02.278
What you do to each other is
one thing, but if you kill them,

38:02.380 --> 38:03.438
you got to kill me, too.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.711
And, there's a whole lot
of trouble backing me up.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.080
Is that all
you've got to say?

38:07.151 --> 38:08.413
No, it's not.

38:08.486 --> 38:09.817
What if Julio didn't do it?

38:09.921 --> 38:11.252
What are you talkin' about?

38:11.355 --> 38:12.720
He shot Jimmy in the back.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.519
How could he have
shot Jimmy in the back

38:14.625 --> 38:16.252
if he was bein'
chased by Jimmy?

38:20.364 --> 38:22.025
Who said
he was bein' chased?

38:22.100 --> 38:23.590
There were no witnesses.

38:23.668 --> 38:24.760
Wait a minute.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.770
Ric says he knew
Jimmy was shot in the back.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.931
How could he know that?
It wasn't made public.

38:29.006 --> 38:32.100
What if Julio's telling the
truth, and somebody else did it?

38:32.176 --> 38:34.235
Any one of the Vengadores
could have done it.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.007
Yeah, but they were
on your turf, right?

38:36.080 --> 38:37.104
So?

38:37.181 --> 38:39.479
So maybe it wasn't one of
the Vengadores after all.

38:39.550 --> 38:40.574
All right, everybody.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.710
Look. Let's just get
this over with, all right?

38:42.820 --> 38:43.946
What's the rush, man?

38:44.055 --> 38:46.683
What are you, the big leader
now that Jimmy's gone, huh?

38:46.791 --> 38:49.259
Yeah, I was his second.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.250
You never liked that much.

38:51.362 --> 38:52.624
What are you sayin'?

38:52.697 --> 38:54.858
That I wasted your
big shot brother?

38:54.932 --> 38:58.424
Big shot! Jimmy wasn't no
big shot, except maybe to you.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.866
You think the enemy
shot your brother.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.130
But sometimes
the most dangerous enemy

39:03.207 --> 39:05.402
can be the one
you trust most.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.000
You're nuts, man.

39:07.245 --> 39:08.473
You shot Jimmy.

39:08.813 --> 39:09.905
KITT.

39:17.955 --> 39:19.252
Good work, KITT.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.688
Naturally.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.019
I'm gonna kill you, man.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.151
No.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.558
I'll turn him over to the
police at the roadblock.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.359
It can end right here

39:27.732 --> 39:29.222
if you let it.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.304
Okay.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.438
Okay.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.744
Let's go, Julio.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.116
What about Terri?

39:52.256 --> 39:54.247
You'll escort the lady home,
won't you?

39:54.358 --> 39:55.655
Yeah.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.761
She'll be okay, man.
Don't worry.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.394
I'll be fine.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.166
Julio, you're
doin' the right thing.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.031
You know that,
don't you?

40:38.102 --> 40:41.594
I know you got some good moves,
gettin' me off like you did.

40:41.806 --> 40:43.364
The truth got you off.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.238
I just needed
somebody to tell it.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.210
In spite of your
treacherous behavior earlier.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.769
What are you talkin' about?

40:49.847 --> 40:51.405
You know perfectly well.

40:52.416 --> 40:54.748
Hey, I was worried
about my old lady.

40:55.319 --> 40:57.685
Hey, man, this is crazy,
I'm talkin' to a car.

41:00.925 --> 41:03.257
You think the cops are gonna believe me?

41:03.327 --> 41:04.658
Probably.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.962
Besides, they've got Ric, and
we'll talk to them together.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.159
After we take care of Becky.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.029
Is that her name? Becky?

41:12.103 --> 41:13.661
Yeah, that's her name.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.065
She's 10, Julio.
And she's beautiful.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.340
And very scared.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.005
Well, I ain't never had
no transplant before.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.814
Hey, they gonna take
anything I need?

41:25.950 --> 41:27.884
Nothing you can't make
more of.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.553
Like some factory, huh?
Will it hurt?

41:33.524 --> 41:36.755
Probably. And there's
some risk involved.

41:37.595 --> 41:40.826
But the procedure isn't
considered life-threatening.

41:41.098 --> 41:43.066
Oh, good.
I get to live, huh?

41:43.267 --> 41:44.393
You're scared?

41:44.468 --> 41:46.959
Michael, my sensors are
picking up a problem ahead.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.768
The road's impassable.
More storm damage.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.671
We got any alternate routes?

41:51.909 --> 41:53.900
One. On the other
side of the river.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.668
All right, let's go for it.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.747
Negative.
The bridge is washed out.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.372
What about turbo boost?

41:59.483 --> 42:01.144
I'm afraid that's
out of the question.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.742
The distance is too great.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.014
We'd just be in
over our heads.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.247
Quite literally.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.221
That's great.
I lose the Conquerors,

42:07.291 --> 42:08.622
and I buy it in
a car accident.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.161
KITT, scan the area. There's
got to be another way.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.058
I'm afraid it's hopeless,
Michael.

42:17.134 --> 42:20.262
No way, KITT. We're talkin'
about Becky's life here.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.365
Wait a minute, Michael.
Center screen.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.602
Those two parallel lines
disappearing in the distance.

42:26.911 --> 42:29.505
Tracks! They're train tracks.

42:29.613 --> 42:30.637
Exactly.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.949
I always wanted to
ride the rails in style.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.692
You're crazy,
you know that?

42:42.760 --> 42:43.784
Hold on.

42:44.495 --> 42:46.622
This is gonna be
an "E" ticket ride.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.263
Very nice, Michael,
very nice.

42:55.339 --> 42:57.671
I couldn't have done it
without you, partner.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.967
You're both crazy.

43:06.684 --> 43:08.709
Michael, I don't
like the sound of that.

43:08.786 --> 43:11.812
I don't either.
Let's get out of here.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.228
How is she?

43:28.639 --> 43:29.765
Laura?

43:32.143 --> 43:34.077
She's so still right now.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.344
As if it were already over.

43:37.915 --> 43:39.143
It's not over.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.415
Becky's a fighter, Laura.

43:41.485 --> 43:44.318
She'll never give up.
And neither must we.

43:45.523 --> 43:48.492
I'm sorry.
I'm just so tired.

43:49.226 --> 43:52.320
And Dr. Kiley says that we
only have so much time left.

43:52.563 --> 43:53.655
I got him.

43:53.731 --> 43:54.698
Thank God.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.495
Everybody,
this is Julio Rodriguez.

43:57.568 --> 43:59.536
I'm so happy you're here.
I'm Devon Miles.

43:59.603 --> 44:02.731
Let me introduce you to
Becky's mother and aunt.

44:02.907 --> 44:05.171
Well, I ain't
never had no transplant.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.002
Will it hurt?

44:07.077 --> 44:08.476
You're scared?

44:10.247 --> 44:13.080
No, I can't do this.

44:16.787 --> 44:19.278
What're you talking about?
Well, I changed my mind.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.358
Look, I didn't wanna come
here in the first place,

44:21.459 --> 44:22.517
but you made me.

44:22.626 --> 44:25.322
You owe me.
I saved your neck.

44:25.396 --> 44:28.797
Look, just because you're crazy,
man, that doesn't mean I am.

44:28.866 --> 44:30.857
You're gonna cop out
on that little girl, huh?

44:30.935 --> 44:33.096
Then you're gonna tell her.

44:59.396 --> 45:00.556
Becky.

45:03.467 --> 45:04.866
Hello, sweetheart.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.893
Hi, Michael.

45:07.838 --> 45:11.069
Guess what? I've got somebody
here who wants to say hello.

45:12.910 --> 45:15.435
Are you the one
that's gonna help me?

45:20.818 --> 45:22.877
You must be pretty scared.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.326
I sure am.

45:32.029 --> 45:34.122
But now that you're here,

45:36.734 --> 45:38.065
maybe,

45:40.271 --> 45:42.739
maybe we can be
scared together.

45:53.517 --> 45:56.213
Bet you couldn't get one of
the Conquerors to do this.

45:56.287 --> 45:57.914
I bet you wouldn't.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.889
Let me ask you something.

46:00.057 --> 46:01.615
Anything you want.

46:02.893 --> 46:05.361
If this is such
a good thing that I'm doin',

46:05.496 --> 46:07.521
how come I don't
feel better doin' it?

46:07.598 --> 46:09.259
Oh, you will.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.064
Oh, you will, man.

46:35.526 --> 46:36.788
Look who's here.

46:37.895 --> 46:39.988
Hey, this is quite
an occasion, pumpkin.

46:40.064 --> 46:41.895
Your first day
out in public.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.763
My, I must say,
you look smashing.

46:44.535 --> 46:45.797
Is that good, Mom?

46:45.869 --> 46:47.268
Good? It's the best.

46:48.839 --> 46:52.070
Gangway! Gangway!
Chair coming through.

46:53.410 --> 46:54.434
Hi, Michael.

46:54.511 --> 46:55.535
Hello, sweetheart.

46:55.613 --> 46:57.046
Hi, Julio.
Hi.

46:57.281 --> 46:59.545
I haven't had a chance
to say thank you.

46:59.617 --> 47:01.812
Ah, it's no big deal.
It's okay.

47:02.219 --> 47:04.949
We all thank you, very much.

47:05.956 --> 47:08.254
Okay, okay.
You're welcome.

47:08.926 --> 47:11.156
Oh, have I got a surprise
for you.

47:11.228 --> 47:12.195
Excuse me.

47:12.529 --> 47:13.962
Surprise?
Mmm-hmm.

47:21.939 --> 47:22.928
All right.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.305
Okay, pal, do your stuff.

47:35.953 --> 47:38.547
Hello, Becky.
I'm so glad to see you.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.288
Me, too.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.417
Can we go for a ride soon?

47:43.594 --> 47:46.062
The doctor says
any day now, buddy.

47:46.163 --> 47:48.961
Wonderful.
That makes me very happy.

47:49.466 --> 47:51.764
Show her how happy
it makes you, KITT.
