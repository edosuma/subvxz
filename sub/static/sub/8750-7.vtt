WEBVTT

00:05.898 --> 00:07.839
He's really mad now.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.529
It's bad for them.

00:09.530 --> 00:11.693
Something grabbed my arm.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.854
Stop it!

00:14.785 --> 00:16.268
He wants us to leave.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.259
He pulls out his gun and he shoots him.

00:18.260 --> 00:19.995
Jeez. What the (Bleep)?

00:19.996 --> 00:24.743
I cannot deny any more what I'm
seeing and hearing myself.

00:24.744 --> 00:26.307
She perished.

00:26.308 --> 00:27.283
Fire.

00:27.284 --> 00:29.308
They just shoved her in a little grave.

00:29.309 --> 00:31.776
I've never seen this before.

00:31.777 --> 00:35.977
I wanna get the (Bleep) Out of here.

00:37.462 --> 00:39.479
There's something down there.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.600
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.389 --> 00:45.623
A lot of dead people are here.

00:45.624 --> 00:46.888
I see dead people.

00:46.889 --> 00:48.586
This is not good.

00:48.587 --> 00:50.536
I speak to dead people..

00:50.537 --> 00:52.263
He is very pissed off.

00:52.264 --> 00:53.662
And they speak to me..

00:53.663 --> 00:55.145
The house is angry.

00:55.146 --> 00:58.588
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.589 --> 01:00.443
He's killed people.

01:00.444 --> 01:01.874
I rely on my partner.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.269
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.343
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

01:05.343 --> 01:06.873
He got shot at his house?

01:06.874 --> 01:09.790
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.139
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:11.140 --> 01:12.481
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.482 --> 01:14.545
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

01:14.546 --> 01:16.698
But Steve and I never speak..

01:16.699 --> 01:18.665
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:18.666 --> 01:19.999
Until the very end..

01:20.000 --> 01:21.256
It's bad.

01:21.257 --> 01:23.447
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:23.448 --> 01:24.731
I'd like some answers.

01:24.732 --> 01:27.732
Or time to get out.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.438 --> 01:55.536
Amy and I conduct our
investigations independently.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.683
I'm in Wichita, Kansas.

02:05.684 --> 02:09.255
I'm on my way to meet a
woman named Kristen.

02:09.256 --> 02:13.673
She's terrified and says there's
strange things going on in her home.

02:13.674 --> 02:16.781
She sent me a video that
even freaked me out.

02:16.782 --> 02:19.415
I can't stop it right now.

02:19.416 --> 02:21.483
Look. Ewe!

02:21.484 --> 02:25.084
I've never seen this before.

02:25.190 --> 02:27.584
To make matters worse, her
grand-kids have moved in with her.

02:27.585 --> 02:31.665
And they're being affected as well.

02:32.019 --> 02:36.579
I'm hopeful we can find her some answers.

02:44.731 --> 02:49.291
It's a long hallway, all black and burnt.

02:50.392 --> 02:52.621
The teenage girl showed up.

02:52.622 --> 02:55.446
There is a huge gash across..

02:55.447 --> 02:59.647
The lower right side of her hairline.

03:16.119 --> 03:18.644
Before Amy can begin her walk,
I need to clear the location

03:18.645 --> 03:21.876
of anything that could influence her.

03:21.877 --> 03:23.743
This house is filled with
personal photographs,

03:23.744 --> 03:29.564
so it's important that I take
my time to remove them all.

04:04.842 --> 04:09.911
There's two people here and they're an
elderly couple.. A man and a woman.

04:09.912 --> 04:12.674
They like it here.
They don't really wanna leave.

04:12.675 --> 04:16.606
And she likes to be, uh,
in everybody's business.

04:16.607 --> 04:20.041
She really likes being dead
because she can sit back

04:20.041 --> 04:22.193
and watch people that come and go.

04:22.194 --> 04:28.094
For her, she says, like, it's like
watching soap operas but they're real.

04:28.658 --> 04:33.818
There's also something here that's not..
So good.

04:37.089 --> 04:40.749
This thing comes from outside.

04:42.621 --> 04:46.941
They called it in, but it's not good.

04:47.927 --> 04:52.547
Yeah, I wanna get the (Bleep) Out of here.

05:02.308 --> 05:04.444
Kristen, you called me and Amy in.

05:04.445 --> 05:07.796
What's going on, and how can we help?

05:07.797 --> 05:09.587
I.. I hear things.

05:09.588 --> 05:12.724
I'll hear bumps against the wall,
and I'm not even sure what it is,

05:12.725 --> 05:14.337
and there's nobody here.

05:14.338 --> 05:15.325
Okay.

05:15.326 --> 05:20.386
I feel things, and I feel it's
connected to me, for some reason.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.848
There's something here that
messes with my emotions.

05:22.849 --> 05:25.459
And it's affecting my grandchildren.

05:25.460 --> 05:29.540
That makes me feel afraid for them.

05:31.328 --> 05:33.933
Has this ever happened to you
before you moved into this house?

05:33.934 --> 05:37.388
Yes. I thought I could handle it on my own,

05:37.389 --> 05:41.871
but it's just too much for
me to handle any more.

05:41.872 --> 05:44.277
Have you thought about just
selling the house and leaving?

05:44.278 --> 05:45.901
That wouldn't work.

05:45.902 --> 05:46.900
Why do you say that?

05:46.901 --> 05:51.168
Because it would go with me wherever I go.

05:51.169 --> 05:52.997
It didn't just start in this house.

05:52.998 --> 05:57.078
It's just continuing in this house.

06:02.888 --> 06:07.448
There is a major sensitive who lives here.

06:08.357 --> 06:10.989
Like, really, really strong abilities.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.910
Okay.

06:24.941 --> 06:29.116
Things are being attracted to this
house, and not good things, either.

06:29.117 --> 06:30.143
Oh, man.

06:30.144 --> 06:31.881
Ha ha.

06:31.882 --> 06:34.222
This hurts.

06:37.220 --> 06:41.756
Some dead people are so powerful
that they make the living very sick,

06:41.757 --> 06:46.629
to the point where they might feel
exhaustion, depression, even physical pain.

06:46.630 --> 06:49.362
It's not a good, healthy situation.

06:49.363 --> 06:51.252
Do you know if it affects the living?

06:51.253 --> 06:54.613
Yeah. It makes them sick.

07:04.201 --> 07:06.215
What's going on in here?

07:06.216 --> 07:08.150
I'll be laying here, trying to sleep,

07:08.151 --> 07:12.093
and hear feet walking up and down the hall.

07:12.094 --> 07:15.851
You can hear it getting closer to my room.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.896
How often does it happen?

07:17.897 --> 07:20.657
Almost every day.

07:22.331 --> 07:25.167
I'm getting, like, a.. Herb? Herbie?

07:25.168 --> 07:29.308
He's real grumpy, really grumpy guy.

07:30.873 --> 07:33.736
His right hip is not good.

07:33.737 --> 07:36.345
But he's always in pain, always in pain.

07:36.346 --> 07:38.568
I go days without sleeping.

07:38.569 --> 07:39.825
I won't sleep in my room.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.537
If I'm alone, I have to
have someone here with me.

07:42.538 --> 07:44.495
I just feel cornered.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.373
Okay.

07:46.374 --> 07:51.834
He doesn't like really anybody
who's ever lived here.

07:52.719 --> 07:53.758
This is his house.

07:53.759 --> 07:58.050
He is asking if we could remove
the people from the home.

07:58.051 --> 08:00.004
He doesn't really give a
(Bleep) About anybody else.

08:00.005 --> 08:03.305
You know, "(Bleep) Them."

08:12.252 --> 08:14.897
I was sitting here in the dining room.

08:14.898 --> 08:16.830
I had my back to the wall.

08:16.831 --> 08:20.110
And all of a sudden, it felt
like something grabbed my arm.

08:20.111 --> 08:23.275
And jerked it forcefully backwards.

08:23.276 --> 08:24.713
Okay, w.. The window's there.

08:24.714 --> 08:28.578
Did somebody.. Could've put their hand
through the window from the outside?

08:28.579 --> 08:31.534
A shut window with the
glass and a screen? No.

08:31.535 --> 08:32.852
Had that ever happened before?

08:32.852 --> 08:36.559
No. No, that never happened before.
But it scared me.

08:36.561 --> 08:37.563
What'd you do?

08:37.565 --> 08:42.184
I started crying and got out of this room.

08:46.261 --> 08:50.401
Herbie's getting a little aggressive.

08:51.887 --> 08:54.047
Stop it!

08:55.653 --> 08:59.743
The dead man Herb is
refusing to leave me alone.

08:59.744 --> 09:03.042
Right now, he's trying to jump me, which
means he's trying to take control

09:03.043 --> 09:05.368
of my thoughts and actions.

09:05.369 --> 09:08.720
This is really dangerous
for me and anyone nearby.

09:08.721 --> 09:10.881
Stop it!

09:17.402 --> 09:20.522
He wants us to leave.

09:24.442 --> 09:27.390
Kristen, you sent me a
pretty intense video.

09:27.391 --> 09:29.759
Oh, here it goes. Here it goes.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.401
It's getting me.

09:31.402 --> 09:33.486
What was going on?

09:33.487 --> 09:39.387
My hands and my feet, the veins
all started popping out of them.

09:39.671 --> 09:41.804
It's going down my thumb.

09:41.805 --> 09:43.676
This is new.

09:43.677 --> 09:49.017
He knows how to physically
manipulate the human body.

09:49.090 --> 09:53.895
It started going up my arm,
both arms, and up my legs.

09:53.896 --> 09:55.918
Here it goes.

09:55.919 --> 09:57.916
I can't stop it right now.

09:57.917 --> 10:00.737
It's going crazy.

10:03.866 --> 10:06.746
My heart's.. Okay.

10:07.209 --> 10:10.607
If you're sitting or laying down, man..

10:10.608 --> 10:12.840
It's down near my foot.

10:12.841 --> 10:14.214
I can tell it's going in it right now.

10:14.215 --> 10:16.562
I can feel it when it happens.

10:16.563 --> 10:20.771
It's going up me, and then
it gets really painful.

10:20.772 --> 10:25.023
It kinda hurts, agitation, up your spine.

10:25.024 --> 10:28.456
I don't know how he knows how to do this.

10:28.457 --> 10:32.057
It's probably gonna kill me.

10:32.904 --> 10:36.378
It felt like every muscle and
everything was just locked up.

10:36.379 --> 10:37.682
Were you in pain?

10:37.683 --> 10:39.543
Yes.

10:41.530 --> 10:43.990
Uncomfortable.

10:44.167 --> 10:46.162
But it's him. It's him.

10:46.163 --> 10:50.183
He's doing that. He's doing that.

10:50.364 --> 10:52.359
Look. Ewe!

10:52.360 --> 10:55.960
I've never seen this before.

11:05.254 --> 11:07.610
Oh, here it goes. Here it goes.

11:07.611 --> 11:10.879
It's getting me. It's going crazy.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.858
Look. Ewe!

11:12.859 --> 11:14.624
I've never seen this before.

11:14.625 --> 11:17.000
Look at these points right here.

11:17.001 --> 11:19.521
What is that?

11:19.874 --> 11:21.349
So how'd you make it stop?

11:21.350 --> 11:23.886
I told it, "that's enough.
I want my body back,"

11:23.887 --> 11:26.527
and it stopped.

11:28.443 --> 11:32.432
I just see, like, random dead people
walking up the stairs outside,

11:32.433 --> 11:38.333
walking in and walking through the
kitchen, walking up to here..

11:39.182 --> 11:42.129
Making living people sick.

11:42.130 --> 11:48.030
Things are being attracted to this
house, and not good things, either.

12:00.279 --> 12:02.364
Jason, I've seen and spoken with Kristen.

12:02.365 --> 12:05.020
How else has the house affected Kristen?

12:05.021 --> 12:07.458
You know, it creates fear in her and angst.

12:07.459 --> 12:10.439
I mean, there's things that'll
happen that wanna get her attention.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.267
And there are days she's just..

12:12.268 --> 12:16.028
Uncomfortable, very unsettled,
and downright scared.

12:16.029 --> 12:20.358
Things happened to her here that worry me.

12:20.359 --> 12:23.085
I wanna talk about the
videos that you took.

12:23.086 --> 12:25.015
What was going on that night?

12:25.016 --> 12:30.591
She just is there with you, obviously,
but her eyes.. Become despondent.

12:30.592 --> 12:34.172
She becomes unaware of what's
around her and removed.

12:34.173 --> 12:37.293
I.. I felt like something was
trying to take over her.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.281
Look. Ewe!

12:39.282 --> 12:42.223
I've never seen this before.

12:42.224 --> 12:43.281
There's something there.

12:43.282 --> 12:49.102
I cannot deny any more what I'm
seeing and hearing myself.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.986
He's mad. He's really mad.

12:53.987 --> 12:56.357
He's really mad now.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.900
Very, very upset right now.

12:58.901 --> 13:00.669
It feels like there's hands on..

13:00.670 --> 13:03.740
Especially, like, my lower.. Like, my..

13:03.741 --> 13:04.940
Right in here.

13:04.941 --> 13:07.009
Like, it's like..

13:07.010 --> 13:08.784
You know? Like..

13:08.785 --> 13:10.812
And then..
But you feel it up your spinal cord.

13:10.813 --> 13:13.449
Like electricity. Like..

13:13.450 --> 13:15.417
And then it just makes you jerk.

13:15.418 --> 13:17.818
It's weird.

13:18.124 --> 13:21.423
Jeez. What the, (Beep) Man? This is weird.

13:21.424 --> 13:24.209
It's like, he knows how to, like,
do the electrical impulses

13:24.210 --> 13:26.663
in your body, your brain.

13:26.664 --> 13:30.024
I don't like it at all.

13:35.235 --> 13:37.613
Jason, you told me about Kristen.

13:37.614 --> 13:39.300
What about you?

13:39.301 --> 13:42.728
Most recently, within the last month,

13:42.729 --> 13:45.472
I was laying there, my hands
are on my chest like this,

13:45.473 --> 13:48.466
and something put its hands on me.

13:48.467 --> 13:54.166
And I look left, and I see a..
A silhouette of a little girl laying here.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.504
Jason, let me ask you something.

13:57.505 --> 13:59.300
What.. What's going on with the grand-kids?

13:59.301 --> 14:01.776
They talk about some dreams that they have.

14:01.777 --> 14:04.454
Kris's granddaughter really
talks about one dream

14:04.455 --> 14:07.567
over and over again and
comes to tears about it.

14:07.568 --> 14:08.914
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:08.915 --> 14:09.827
What was the dream?

14:09.828 --> 14:15.135
The way she described it to us was, that
her little brother was being cornered

14:15.136 --> 14:18.347
and these small, monstrous
little characters

14:18.348 --> 14:20.704
were throwing
things at his face,

14:20.705 --> 14:24.485
making him cry and hurting him.

14:25.482 --> 14:27.109
Did she say what they looked like?

14:27.110 --> 14:33.010
Yeah, she actually drew what she saw
in her dreams, on many occasions.

14:35.325 --> 14:36.670
What's these things on the head?

14:36.671 --> 14:39.227
She drew those as antennas or something.

14:39.228 --> 14:41.408
"Ogre face" is how she could describe it.

14:41.409 --> 14:45.552
She said it was real long and
skinny, had long arms, pointy head.

14:45.553 --> 14:49.002
And she did them again and again, and she
kept the characters looking the same.

14:49.003 --> 14:52.243
She didn't change them.

14:52.422 --> 14:56.502
So there's this thing on the roof.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.098
And it..

14:59.444 --> 15:03.884
Has been up there for a few months now.

15:03.918 --> 15:05.491
I don't know what this thing is.

15:05.492 --> 15:07.093
It's, uh, long..

15:07.094 --> 15:09.840
Long, skinny. Like, uh..

15:09.841 --> 15:13.621
Some kind of bug-looking thing.

15:14.802 --> 15:17.812
It just, like, scuttles..

15:17.813 --> 15:20.036
On the roof.

15:20.037 --> 15:22.121
Like that.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.481
And then, you know, it'll stop.

15:24.482 --> 15:27.179
You know, but it gets it's self worked up,

15:27.180 --> 15:31.602
and then it does again and
again and tries to get in.

15:31.603 --> 15:37.303
There's someone in here that
it wants to be attached to.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.197
Elysia, I was talking to your Mom.

15:50.198 --> 15:52.850
She explained some of things
going on in the house.

15:52.851 --> 15:55.127
I understand that your son,
your niece, and your nephew

15:55.128 --> 15:59.235
all spent some time here, uh, and
they've had some strange experiences.

15:59.236 --> 16:01.399
What happens with your son?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.145
Well, my son sees things.

16:03.146 --> 16:06.089
He gets drawn to certain
areas in the hallway.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.092
He just keeps peaking over to the
corner, kinda looking at something.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.484
"Mommy, what's that? What is that?"

16:11.485 --> 16:14.345
He asks me, and I look, and
there's nothing there.

16:14.346 --> 16:15.887
Does he ever describe it to you?

16:15.888 --> 16:17.022
He says "monster,"

16:17.023 --> 16:21.383
or he says, "oh, no!"
And he backs up and gets on his knees.

16:21.384 --> 16:26.685
Jason had described, uh, your Mom
having a dark energy overcome her.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.652
Uh, what do you make of that?

16:28.653 --> 16:31.506
Well, my Mom used to be
really funny and witty

16:31.507 --> 16:35.068
and outgoing, and lately she's just..
Different.

16:35.069 --> 16:39.029
I think it's stealing parts of her.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.646
I just wanna know what
it is and what we feel.

16:41.647 --> 16:42.949
There's too many things that have happened

16:42.950 --> 16:46.054
to where we can't deny
that something's there.

16:46.055 --> 16:48.923
What are you hoping our
investigation will do for your Mom?

16:48.924 --> 16:54.824
I just hope that it frees her,
and we get our.. Our Mom back.

16:59.326 --> 17:01.240
Uh.. It wants in.

17:01.241 --> 17:03.801
It wants the person.

17:03.802 --> 17:05.836
It's not helping. It's not benefiting them.

17:05.837 --> 17:08.007
It's not good for them.

17:08.008 --> 17:12.236
It's bad for them. It's bad.
It's bad for them.

17:12.237 --> 17:15.023
You said it wants to attach
itself to this person.

17:15.025 --> 17:18.387
So what does that mean?
Or what would that..

17:18.387 --> 17:19.540
What would happen to them?

17:19.541 --> 17:23.321
The person would do bad things.

17:37.821 --> 17:39.653
Uh.. It wants in.

17:39.654 --> 17:42.654
It wants the person.

17:44.782 --> 17:49.171
It's bad for them. It's bad.
It's bad for them.

17:49.172 --> 17:51.803
You said it wants to attach
itself to this person.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.130
So what does that mean?
Or what would that..

17:55.131 --> 17:57.222
What would happen to them?

17:57.223 --> 17:59.794
The person would do bad things,

17:59.795 --> 18:02.905
like, hurt.. Like, hurt people.
Like, hurt.. Hurt people..

18:02.906 --> 18:06.026
Make them hurt people.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.986
It's my job to find out who lived and
who died on our client's property.

18:15.987 --> 18:17.902
Going through the deed, I
was able to track down

18:17.903 --> 18:20.291
the last owner of Kristen's house.

18:20.292 --> 18:23.344
But he died several years ago, so
I'm going to speak with a neighbor

18:23.345 --> 18:28.265
to find out a little bit
more about this guy.

18:31.556 --> 18:34.001
Did you know who lived in Kristen's
house before she move in?

18:34.002 --> 18:36.748
There was an older gentleman
that lived there.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.366
- Had you ever spoken to him?
- Yes.

18:39.367 --> 18:40.814
What kind of a guy was he?

18:40.815 --> 18:43.921
He was just a little bit grouchy.

18:43.922 --> 18:48.206
The kids would run up and down the street,
and he would be kinda yelling at 'em

18:48.207 --> 18:52.587
because they were too loud or something.

18:53.746 --> 18:56.669
Did he ever talk to you or mention
to anybody in the neighborhood

18:56.670 --> 18:58.442
about funny things going on at the house?

18:58.443 --> 18:59.614
No.

18:59.615 --> 19:02.291
- And he was there a while?
- Yes.

19:02.292 --> 19:04.151
How about the rest of your neighbors?

19:04.152 --> 19:07.501
Uh, we're not aware of anything that..
That's been going on.

19:07.502 --> 19:09.869
- Your house is good?
- Yes.

19:09.870 --> 19:11.790
Okay.

19:26.762 --> 19:29.522
Herb feels like..

19:29.775 --> 19:32.355
He lived here.

19:35.529 --> 19:39.464
When he died, I don't know if he
actually lived and died here.

19:39.465 --> 19:44.363
Or if he, like, put himself here because
it looks like he's in an apartment.

19:44.364 --> 19:47.212
So he could've, like, died there but..

19:47.213 --> 19:49.101
Wanted to be dying here?

19:49.102 --> 19:50.591
So he did live here at some point?

19:50.592 --> 19:52.018
I feel like yes, yes.

19:52.019 --> 19:52.745
Okay.

19:52.746 --> 19:55.508
This is his house, not theirs.

19:55.509 --> 20:00.009
The living people.. He doesn't like 'em..

20:00.340 --> 20:02.084
Because they..

20:02.085 --> 20:03.892
Annoy him.

20:03.893 --> 20:05.252
They're in his space.

20:05.253 --> 20:08.448
This his is space. He likes it.

20:08.449 --> 20:11.329
This is his house.

20:13.424 --> 20:16.750
Kristen lives in a district
of Wichita called Delano.

20:16.751 --> 20:18.612
So I'm going to speak
with a local historian

20:18.613 --> 20:23.293
who knows that part of town inside and out.

20:28.129 --> 20:29.553
I was talking to a few people in town,

20:29.554 --> 20:32.940
and they said that Delano was
pretty wild back in the day.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.467
Uh, what can you tell me about that?

20:34.468 --> 20:38.334
Well, Delano was pretty much what you
would consider the red light district.

20:38.335 --> 20:39.518
It was sin city.

20:39.519 --> 20:42.768
It was Wichita's place where all the things

20:42.769 --> 20:44.992
that people didn't wanna
know about happened.

20:44.993 --> 20:49.450
It was a place for the Cowboys to
blow off a little bit of steam,

20:49.451 --> 20:53.766
a chance for them to get loose
after basically being on the trail

20:53.767 --> 20:58.447
for 3 months, 7 days a week, 16-hour days.

21:00.279 --> 21:02.796
It sounds like a real recipe for trouble.

21:02.797 --> 21:05.260
Yeah. Yeah, there were an
awful lot of things went on,

21:05.261 --> 21:07.440
on that side of the river.

21:07.441 --> 21:08.678
Anything in particular?

21:08.679 --> 21:11.923
There was a.. A horrendous
gun battle there in Delano.

21:11.924 --> 21:13.708
Uh, there were two gentlemen..

21:13.709 --> 21:19.319
One by the name of "Rowdy" Joe Lowe
and his competitor "Red" Beard.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.343
And, uh, Red Beard and
Rowdy Joe had dance halls

21:23.344 --> 21:27.064
that were right beside each other.

21:27.065 --> 21:30.304
The season hadn't been going
very well for Red Beard.

21:30.305 --> 21:31.398
The money wasn't as good.

21:31.399 --> 21:34.034
Plus, Rowdy was 20 years younger.

21:34.035 --> 21:38.535
I think he just was out-and-out jealous.

21:38.766 --> 21:43.471
And Red Beard sees Joe
in the other building..

21:43.472 --> 21:48.212
And he pulls out his gun and he shoots him.

21:50.467 --> 21:51.980
So in the middle of the gun battle,

21:51.981 --> 21:54.586
a couple of folks were shot..
Um, one of which was

21:54.587 --> 21:57.874
a prostitute under Red's
employ, Annie Franklin.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.522
Shot in the stomach, in the midsection.

21:59.523 --> 22:05.423
Doctors assumed that it was
probably gonna be a mortal wound.

22:05.544 --> 22:07.021
There is a woman.

22:07.022 --> 22:10.206
I saw her.
She's laying, and she has, like..

22:10.207 --> 22:12.604
All this is open. Like..

22:12.605 --> 22:17.405
You know, blood and tissue and..
Skull/brain.

22:18.059 --> 22:19.859
Ow!

22:21.742 --> 22:25.858
Being a sensitive, I can feel what
a dead person is experiencing..

22:25.859 --> 22:27.072
Ow.

22:27.073 --> 22:32.353
And the pain this woman went
through was unbearable.

22:34.984 --> 22:36.784
Mm.

22:36.979 --> 22:39.242
But then I felt this crush in..

22:39.243 --> 22:43.225
Shot, and my ear filled up with..
With blood.

22:43.226 --> 22:47.227
And.. But then I do hear
gunshots and I see a black gun.

22:47.228 --> 22:51.608
This girl, she died in the neighborhood.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.032
And it was a big deal.

22:56.033 --> 22:58.989
Okay, so she's an innocent bystander
and she takes one to the stomach.

22:58.990 --> 23:00.611
Pretty much. Pretty much.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.984
And from all accounts, she
probably died from those wounds.

23:02.985 --> 23:04.150
More than likely.

23:04.151 --> 23:06.031
As far as prostitutes went back then,

23:06.032 --> 23:08.855
uh, if they pass away,
what happens to them?

23:08.856 --> 23:13.536
More than likely, it was a pauper's burial.

23:13.553 --> 23:15.451
Basically, just a hole in the ground.

23:15.452 --> 23:19.592
Not a headstone at all of any kind.

23:21.684 --> 23:24.961
So this girl with this, uh..

23:24.962 --> 23:27.779
With the thing with her head, you know..

23:27.780 --> 23:33.680
Yeah, they, uh, they shoved her in a little
grave there, and she just rotted up.

23:39.683 --> 23:41.527
As far as prostitutes went back then,

23:41.528 --> 23:44.579
uh, if they pass away,
what happens to them?

23:44.580 --> 23:49.151
More than likely, it was a pauper's burial.

23:49.152 --> 23:51.076
Basically, just a hole in the ground.

23:51.077 --> 23:55.217
Not a headstone at all of any kind.

24:02.629 --> 24:06.236
I'm getting that pain back again.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.597
There was a girl.

24:07.598 --> 24:12.818
She got her face bashed
in and her head cut open.

24:15.112 --> 24:21.012
They just shoved her in a little
grave there, and she just rotted up.

24:27.753 --> 24:31.986
I'm doing one last archive
search on Kristen's property

24:31.987 --> 24:35.347
when I hit something big.

24:41.193 --> 24:45.531
A massive fire broke out just down
the street from Kristen's house.

24:45.532 --> 24:48.458
It's a long shot, but I'm going
to meet with the local fire chief

24:48.459 --> 24:54.359
to see if there might be some connection
to what Kristen's experiencing.

25:06.176 --> 25:08.022
I'm conducting an
investigation in the area,

25:08.023 --> 25:10.576
and, uh, came across an
article during my research

25:10.577 --> 25:13.823
about a Masonic home that was,
uh, burned down in 1916.

25:13.824 --> 25:15.319
Can you help me with that?

25:15.320 --> 25:17.739
Yes. That fire was started from a boiler.

25:17.740 --> 25:20.960
The.. The boiler was inspected
and found to have a leak.

25:20.961 --> 25:23.689
They decided that it was
safe enough to use.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.605
They said, "if we keep a watchman
watching it, it'll be okay."

25:26.606 --> 25:30.724
There was a 16-year-old boy that
was on watch, and he fell asleep.

25:30.725 --> 25:36.625
And he woke up about 2:00 in the morning,
and the boiler room was on fire.

25:45.405 --> 25:49.185
What are you feeling right now?

25:53.454 --> 25:55.374
Fire.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.040
The hallway was burned,
and the lady was burned.

26:08.161 --> 26:11.154
Do you know how many people,
including the children, there were?

26:11.155 --> 26:12.755
108.

26:12.756 --> 26:14.134
Now how many kids were
living there at the time?

26:14.135 --> 26:16.209
It was 47.

26:16.210 --> 26:21.970
Here's a picture of some of
the children that were there.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.029
What can you tell me about the victims?

26:32.030 --> 26:33.594
There was two elderly couples..

26:33.595 --> 26:36.552
Mr. and Mrs. Brown and
Mr. and Mrs. Ferris..

26:36.553 --> 26:39.092
And then a young lady, 20
years old, that worked there.

26:39.093 --> 26:42.441
She was taking care of the children.

26:42.442 --> 26:44.294
She was gonna get married in the spring.

26:44.295 --> 26:48.265
She had been working on her wedding
dress, and, uh, when the fire came,

26:48.266 --> 26:51.838
she got all the children in
her care out of the building,

26:51.839 --> 26:53.871
and then thinking that the
fire would be extinguished,

26:53.872 --> 26:55.663
she pushed past the firefighter,

26:55.664 --> 26:58.185
went back in to get her wedding
dress, and she perished.

26:58.186 --> 27:00.406
Oh, jeez.

27:06.139 --> 27:07.318
The home was destroyed, basically.

27:07.319 --> 27:09.473
So where did these kids go?

27:09.474 --> 27:14.528
There was no evacuation plan whatsoever,
so they just went out across the snow..

27:14.529 --> 27:20.109
Some of 'em barefoot..
Going to the houses in the area.

27:25.623 --> 27:30.034
I encountered several entities on my walk,
but the old man named Herb stood out

27:30.035 --> 27:35.435
as the most powerful and
threatening inside the house.

27:36.386 --> 27:39.717
Who are we sketching today?

27:39.718 --> 27:41.283
It was an older male.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.204
Okay.

27:45.726 --> 27:49.146
He has a long, oval face.

27:52.265 --> 27:55.625
He has a drinker's nose.

27:58.438 --> 28:00.718
Two chins.

28:01.212 --> 28:04.992
What race would this person be?

28:05.066 --> 28:06.000
Mm, white?

28:06.001 --> 28:08.401
White? Okay.

28:08.845 --> 28:12.710
Is there anything about
his eyes in particular?

28:12.711 --> 28:14.042
He has brown eyes.

28:14.043 --> 28:15.329
Brown. Okay.

28:15.330 --> 28:17.850
Almond-shaped.

28:19.616 --> 28:23.897
Is this the man that you remember seeing?

28:23.898 --> 28:24.972
Yes.

28:24.973 --> 28:27.373
That's him.

28:50.262 --> 28:54.017
After working independently of each
other for the entire investigation,

28:54.018 --> 28:58.588
Amy and I are sharing our
findings for the first time.

28:58.589 --> 29:02.521
Kristen's had some pretty wild and
bizarre things happening here.

29:02.522 --> 29:05.184
Thing is, now one of her daughters
and two of her grandchildren

29:05.185 --> 29:08.552
are here with her now, and
whatever's happening in the house,

29:08.553 --> 29:10.618
it's starting to affect the kids also.

29:10.619 --> 29:15.278
A big part of the reason
we're here is the kids.

29:15.279 --> 29:19.263
The minute I walked into this house,
I knew someone here had abilities,

29:19.264 --> 29:22.771
and I have a pretty good
idea that it's Kristen.

29:22.772 --> 29:28.292
Amy, maybe you could tell us
about your walk a little.

29:29.686 --> 29:34.606
The first thing I encountered
was a dead girl.

29:35.798 --> 29:40.994
Then I saw a gun, and there
were brains and blood.

29:40.995 --> 29:42.644
She was killed.

29:42.645 --> 29:45.498
I do hear gunshots and I see a black gun.

29:45.499 --> 29:49.027
And she has, like..
All this is open. Like..

29:49.028 --> 29:53.228
You know, blood and tissue and brain.

29:53.468 --> 29:55.268
Ow!

29:59.402 --> 30:05.302
And then I saw her being thrown
into a really shallow grave.

30:08.625 --> 30:12.485
This house, believe it or not,
sits right in the middle

30:12.486 --> 30:16.614
of what was once a very
violent neighborhood.

30:16.615 --> 30:20.086
And it was like the wild wild west here.

30:20.087 --> 30:24.677
There was a.. A big shootout
between two brothel owners,

30:24.678 --> 30:27.501
and the brothels were right
next door to each other.

30:27.502 --> 30:31.822
Once guy, "Rowdy" Joe Lowe, gets shot..

30:34.692 --> 30:38.075
And a prostitute gets killed.

30:38.076 --> 30:40.424
They gave her a pauper's burial.

30:40.425 --> 30:46.125
You know, dig a hole, stick
her in it, and you're done.

30:48.215 --> 30:51.182
I wasn't able to track down
a picture of this woman.

30:51.183 --> 30:55.714
Back in the 1870s, hardly
anyone had their picture taken.

30:55.715 --> 30:57.408
So unfortunately, we'll never know

30:57.409 --> 31:03.109
if Amy saw the prostitute who
was killed in the shootout.

31:04.103 --> 31:05.255
What else did you see?

31:05.256 --> 31:09.996
Children were playing,
and there was a fire.

31:10.411 --> 31:16.034
I saw the hallway burned, and
there was a woman who was burned.

31:16.035 --> 31:21.555
And she said, "I'm half the
woman I used to be now."

31:22.754 --> 31:24.737
A couple blocks from here,
there was a Masonic home

31:24.738 --> 31:28.772
that was a home for Masons that
were retired and for orphans.

31:28.773 --> 31:30.519
And this is actually the building.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.700
108 people lived there.

31:34.806 --> 31:38.166
47 of them were children.

31:40.921 --> 31:46.409
These are like the kids that would've
been orphans in the Mason home.

31:46.410 --> 31:52.310
Late December, back in 1916, at 2:00
in the morning, a fire breaks out.

31:53.007 --> 31:55.504
What happened was, they had a 16-year-old
kid that was watching a boiler

31:55.505 --> 31:56.555
that was faulty.

31:56.556 --> 31:59.954
He fell asleep. He woke up to flames.

31:59.955 --> 32:01.444
The kids all got out.

32:01.445 --> 32:06.138
They went running, and they actually ran
to people's homes in the area for help,

32:06.139 --> 32:10.339
because they didn't know what to do.

32:12.886 --> 32:17.266
You guys hear kids in the house, right?

32:17.439 --> 32:21.099
Yes, and running in the hall.

32:21.275 --> 32:24.300
You also had another incident with
a kid, while you were in bed.

32:24.301 --> 32:30.201
Yeah, I was laying there, and I felt a
cold hand go over both of my hands.

32:31.067 --> 32:35.748
And I woke up, and I looked left, and
I see a little girl right beside me.

32:35.749 --> 32:38.674
I thought maybe it was her
granddaughter, and it wasn't.

32:38.675 --> 32:40.535
Hmm.

32:43.146 --> 32:44.222
What else did you see?

32:44.223 --> 32:49.000
Coming from the back door into
the little dining area in there

32:49.001 --> 32:53.141
was a lot of dead people coming in.

32:55.027 --> 32:56.422
What do you mean?

32:56.423 --> 33:00.263
They were just in line, walking.

33:01.169 --> 33:03.700
They're drawn here by something,

33:03.701 --> 33:08.298
and it's not good for the
dead people or the living.

33:08.299 --> 33:14.199
So it's having a negative effect
both on you and on the dead.

33:14.604 --> 33:18.812
Upset stomachs to, uh, ulcers, fatigue.

33:18.813 --> 33:20.563
She described every one of those things.

33:20.564 --> 33:23.194
- Mm-hmm.
- And any time I'm here,

33:23.195 --> 33:25.652
- uh, my stomach just gets upset..
- Really upset

33:25.653 --> 33:31.553
and then I'm.. When I'm not here, I'm
fine, and it's just strange to me.

33:31.664 --> 33:33.075
You encounter anything else?

33:33.076 --> 33:35.956
I encountered Herb.

33:36.078 --> 33:38.178
He is..

33:38.415 --> 33:43.275
An elderly man who got
very physical with me.

33:43.348 --> 33:46.505
What do you mean he got physical with you?
What.. W.. How?

33:46.506 --> 33:52.170
He has learned how to manipulate the
human body and the human brain,

33:52.171 --> 33:54.035
it was just like, an onslaught.

33:54.036 --> 33:56.884
Um, and it was extremely painful.

33:56.885 --> 33:59.045
Stop it!

34:04.503 --> 34:09.507
I'm angry at this guy that's around
here that shouldn't be here.

34:09.509 --> 34:15.409
He starts off charming and then gets
agitated and irritated and not so nice.

34:15.806 --> 34:16.983
He's got a problem.

34:16.984 --> 34:21.248
And he prefers the back bedroom now,
so I'm concerned about the children.

34:21.248 --> 34:24.728
Without a doubt, it's him.

34:24.905 --> 34:26.558
Kristen, tell her what happened.

34:26.559 --> 34:29.322
I was feeding my grandson
in the high chair,

34:29.324 --> 34:34.053
and all of a sudden, my arm was
grabbed and jerked backwards.

34:34.054 --> 34:36.317
Oh, I think that's Herb.

34:36.318 --> 34:40.056
Amy, is the guy Herb, who you say is
causing Kristen all these problems here,

34:40.058 --> 34:43.021
is that the guy you sketched?

34:43.022 --> 34:45.571
I don't see the sketch
when, uh, Amy does it.

34:45.572 --> 34:51.452
I'm gonna see it for the first
time tonight with you guys.

35:00.882 --> 35:02.742
Hmm.

35:05.768 --> 35:07.628
Wow.

35:09.619 --> 35:13.459
He doesn't look so nice to me.

35:13.534 --> 35:17.800
Well, initially when I met him,
you know, he was not very happy.

35:17.801 --> 35:20.899
But to me, it just seemed
like a grumpy old man,

35:20.900 --> 35:24.019
and they can sometimes be endearing.

35:24.020 --> 35:29.920
So then when he figured out
that I wasn't here to help him,

35:30.194 --> 35:34.532
he was like, "oh.
You're not gonna help me get rid of them?"

35:34.533 --> 35:37.866
"You're here to get rid of me?"

35:37.867 --> 35:41.407
That's when he attacked me.

35:41.771 --> 35:47.111
I have a picture of the
former owner of this house.

35:48.638 --> 35:51.262
That's not him.

35:51.263 --> 35:54.376
So my question to you is, who is he
and what the hell is he doing here?

35:54.377 --> 35:58.097
He's attracted to this house..

35:58.476 --> 36:03.845
Because there is someone
residing in this house who is..

36:03.846 --> 36:06.126
Very open.

36:06.677 --> 36:10.597
I'm starting to believe that Kristen's
abilities are very powerful..

36:10.598 --> 36:14.805
So powerful she may be attracting
the dead from miles away.

36:14.806 --> 36:20.132
There's a question I always ask to
see if someone might be a sensitive.

36:20.133 --> 36:22.484
One question I had was..

36:22.485 --> 36:25.845
Do you have vivid dreams?

36:27.471 --> 36:28.942
- Always.
- Mm-hmm?

36:28.943 --> 36:34.843
And they're so clear that I remember them
the whole next day and the next night.

36:35.928 --> 36:40.566
No matter where you go, you're
going to open doorways.

36:40.567 --> 36:42.441
So is it her or the house?

36:42.442 --> 36:45.322
Oh, no, it's her.

37:03.364 --> 37:07.439
No matter where you go, you're
going to open doorways.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.415
You come with a door.

37:10.416 --> 37:12.342
So is it her or the house?

37:12.343 --> 37:13.952
Oh, no, it's her.

37:13.953 --> 37:18.933
Yeah, I mean, you're open.
You're a sensitive.

37:21.027 --> 37:25.047
And the dead are looking for help.

37:26.909 --> 37:29.623
I got really emotional learning
that you were coming here

37:29.624 --> 37:31.711
because I started feeling really guilty

37:31.712 --> 37:35.387
and I couldn't understand it,
like I was letting someone down.

37:35.388 --> 37:40.519
It's just a real sad feeling that
comes over me when it happens.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.402
As sensitives, the dead will
form relationships with us.

37:44.403 --> 37:46.843
They kind of move in.

37:46.844 --> 37:52.225
It's because we're still alive and
we can hear and see and feel them,

37:52.226 --> 37:53.817
and they don't want to leave.

37:53.818 --> 37:54.923
Mm-hmm.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.162
All right, let me
show you the video.

37:56.163 --> 37:58.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:00.386 --> 38:02.471
Look. Ewe!

38:02.472 --> 38:04.273
I've never seen this before.

38:04.274 --> 38:06.611
Oh, here it goes. Here it goes.

38:06.612 --> 38:12.482
It's getting me. It's probably gonna
kill me I can't stop it right now.

38:12.483 --> 38:14.616
It's gotten crazy.

38:14.617 --> 38:16.945
Look at these points right here.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.150
What is that?

38:19.151 --> 38:23.515
I've seen attacks like this before,
and Kristen is playing with fire.

38:23.516 --> 38:29.416
She's in serious danger and could
get herself hurt or worse.

38:29.473 --> 38:33.739
So jumping is when they try
to get inside of your body..

38:33.740 --> 38:35.245
- Mm-hmm.
- And control your body.

38:35.246 --> 38:39.588
And typically, any kind of
dead person will attempt this,

38:39.589 --> 38:41.389
whether they're good or bad.

38:41.390 --> 38:47.290
And it's not good for our bodies
and it can cause uh, major damage.

38:48.409 --> 38:54.309
So it's best not to allow that, because
I did run into another entity.

38:54.506 --> 38:57.326
It is really bad.

38:58.325 --> 39:04.225
It crawls around on the roof and goes
around the windows and the doors,

39:04.540 --> 39:07.421
and it tries to get in.

39:07.422 --> 39:11.442
To me, it looked like a huge bug.

39:12.207 --> 39:16.467
And this thing attached itself to you.

39:20.347 --> 39:23.252
Let me ask you about
this thing on the roof.

39:23.253 --> 39:26.267
If they decide to do nothing,
what can go wrong here?

39:26.268 --> 39:31.788
If this thing gets in, you'll
probably lose your mind.

39:34.233 --> 39:38.114
Amy's made it very clear
how dangerous it is.

39:38.115 --> 39:42.171
The big question is, can you do something
to make you and your family safe?

39:42.172 --> 39:46.192
I can't answer that, but Amy can.

39:48.910 --> 39:52.059
The first thing is setting up boundaries.

39:52.060 --> 39:57.940
You have a lot of dead people
that are just roaming around.

39:59.501 --> 40:03.848
And it's physical things that
you can do to seal your home.

40:03.849 --> 40:05.448
How do they go about sealing the house?

40:05.449 --> 40:08.198
You go outside and you're
doing salt around your house

40:08.199 --> 40:12.920
and Sage to your house to stop
the energy from getting in.

40:12.921 --> 40:17.385
So you need to tell them to leave
and then seal your property

40:17.386 --> 40:20.108
so that the family's safe, you're safe,

40:20.109 --> 40:25.449
and the dead are being helped
in an appropriate way.

40:25.936 --> 40:28.838
In the meantime, are the kids safe?

40:28.839 --> 40:33.399
As soon as you lock down the house, yeah.

40:36.999 --> 40:40.061
With Herb, you really have to be firm.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.901
Does he respect that this is not his house?

40:41.902 --> 40:43.400
He really wants you guys to go.

40:43.401 --> 40:45.377
He wants to move in and take over.

40:45.378 --> 40:48.637
But the thing is, is he can't do that.
He's dead.

40:48.638 --> 40:50.632
You're not. You're alive.

40:50.633 --> 40:53.041
Your energy surpasses his energy.

40:53.042 --> 40:56.043
You gotta throw him out.

40:56.044 --> 40:59.284
We have control, period.

40:59.451 --> 41:04.551
And they cannot be in our
space if we say "no."

41:04.773 --> 41:10.673
And then when you're good, you can
open up for business, so to speak.

41:14.547 --> 41:17.973
Hopefully, now Amy at least
gave you some answers.

41:17.974 --> 41:20.248
Uh, what you do with it is up to you.

41:20.249 --> 41:25.109
But my suggestion is
listen to what she says.

41:25.985 --> 41:30.194
I'm definitely gonna listen
to what you suggest I do,

41:30.195 --> 41:32.894
because now I feel like I
have some tools to start with

41:32.895 --> 41:36.196
to.. To put a stop to it.

41:36.197 --> 41:39.763
Coming to terms with your abilities
can be a difficult process,

41:39.764 --> 41:43.984
but once Kristen learns how to separate
the good dead from the bad dead,

41:43.985 --> 41:49.885
she'll be able to keep herself and
her grand-kids safe from harm.
