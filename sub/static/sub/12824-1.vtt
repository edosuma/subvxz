<i>NASA scientists are excited
over recent findings by the Mars Rover</i>

01:14.840 --> 01:18.196
<i>of fossilised organic compounds
on the surface that indicate</i>

01:18.240 --> 01:22.870
<i>at some time in the past there
may have been life on the red planet.</i>

03:52.560 --> 03:53.754
Thank you.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.351
Was it really that hard?

03:57.400 --> 04:00.153
Every day with the trash!
What is the big deal?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.919
Well, can you imagine
what the world would look like

04:02.960 --> 04:06.475
- if nobody took out the trash?
- Yeah, it would be awesome.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.592
And speaking of trash,
have you cleaned your room yet?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.835
And don't forget to shut the door.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.190
Milo, sweetie, can you get that?

04:19.519 --> 04:21.636
I have to do everything around here.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.792
Stromboli's Slave Shack,
captive 331 speaking.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.719
<i>- Hey, stinker.
- Dad! Hey, are you almost home?</i>

04:30.760 --> 04:34.309
Because the movie starts at five, and
then it starts again at seven, and I...

04:34.360 --> 04:36.112
<i>Hold on. Slow down. Slowdown.</i>

04:36.160 --> 04:38.037
<i>I don't think I'm gonna
make it back in time.</i>

04:38.840 --> 04:40.239
Well, you can't miss the beginning.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.077
That's when the vampires take
over the submarine...

04:42.120 --> 04:45.715
No, I know. I know. But...
looks like my flight's cancelled.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.228
<i>And no one's flying till
this weather lets up.</i>

04:48.280 --> 04:50.430
<i>I'm really sorry, Milo.</i>

04:50.480 --> 04:52.630
<i>I'll make it home as soon as I can.</i>

04:52.680 --> 04:55.752
<i>- I love you.
- OK. Bye.</i>

04:56.440 --> 04:58.795
<i>- Hi, honey. What's up?
- Stuck at the airport.</i>

04:58.840 --> 05:01.912
That's too bad. Milo was
really looking forward to...

05:01.960 --> 05:04.554
<i>- I was looking forward to taking him.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

05:04.600 --> 05:05.919
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

05:05.960 --> 05:09.236
Well, maybe if he
finishes all his dinner

05:09.280 --> 05:12.670
<i>he could watch Zombie Dawn III
on pay-per-view.</i>

05:13.240 --> 05:16.630
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

05:21.480 --> 05:23.118
You didn't eat your broccoli.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.998
Broccoli makes me barf.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.519
Besides, it looks like brains.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.950
Well, you like zombies.
Zombies eat brains.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.151
Mom, no one likes zombies.
They're an abomination.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.758
I'm committed to their annihilation.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.918
OK. Well, no broccoli, no TV.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.594
Milo!

06:16.760 --> 06:18.432
Come over here.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.838
- Is that broccoli?
- No. That's vomit,

06:25.880 --> 06:29.429
- but I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.272
Well, you're not gonna make me
eat it now, are you?

06:33.720 --> 06:35.756
- Go to bed.
- But you said I could watch...

06:35.800 --> 06:39.270
No. That was before you lied
to me and poisoned the cat!

06:39.320 --> 06:40.912
- That broccoli was poisonous?
- No!

06:40.960 --> 06:43.076
Of course the broccoli
wasn't poisonous.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.997
- Well, you just said that...
- No!

06:45.040 --> 06:47.315
I meant that it's
poisonous to the cat.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.794
Well, how can it be good for me
if it's poisonous to the cat?

06:49.840 --> 06:53.071
Because cats are not
supposed to eat vegetables.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.792
Maybe I'm not
supposed to eat vegetables.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.035
Milo! Just go to bed.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.835
Now.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.796
I thought I told you to go to bed!

07:10.840 --> 07:13.798
You told me to go to bed.
You didn't say get into bed.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.353
- It's not specific.
- Milo!

07:16.000 --> 07:20.039
My life would be so much better
if I didn't have to be a nagging mom.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.913
Yeah, well, my life would be so much
better if I didn't have a mom at all.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.390
Cujo. Wake up.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.351
I can't sleep.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.951
I shouldn't have said
what I said, should I?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.392
It wasn't a good thing to say.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.434
I feel really bad about it.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.514
I should go tell her I'm sorry.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.270
Right? I'm gonna go
tell her I'm sorry. Right now.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.234
Mom? Are you still up?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.271
'Cause I wanted to tell you that...

09:09.080 --> 09:10.274
Mom?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.069
Mom?

09:21.880 --> 09:23.552
Milo?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.469
Mom?

09:33.480 --> 09:34.549
Mom!

09:55.400 --> 09:56.389
Mom?

09:59.360 --> 10:00.349
Mom!

10:02.760 --> 10:05.911
Let her go! Let her go!

10:08.160 --> 10:12.039
Let her go!
Let her go!

10:13.240 --> 10:14.229
Mom!

10:22.120 --> 10:23.394
Let me go!

10:38.080 --> 10:40.753
Hey! I'm... I'm caught in here!
Let me...

10:42.040 --> 10:45.874
Wow! I'm in a spaceship!

10:51.240 --> 10:55.233
This is so cool!

13:46.080 --> 13:47.991
Did I get super powers?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.431
Hello? Is anyone there?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.715
Hello?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.389
What's going on?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.669
Low gravity!

14:49.560 --> 14:50.754
Keep it together!

14:58.080 --> 14:59.672
<i>Jump down chute number three.</i>

15:00.760 --> 15:02.557
What? Who's there?

15:03.280 --> 15:06.078
<i>Hey, keep it quiet,
and jump down chute number three!</i>

15:07.480 --> 15:09.038
You want me to jump in there?

15:09.560 --> 15:10.549
Why?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.239
<i>Jump down chute number three!</i>

15:18.280 --> 15:19.633
<i>Just jump down the chute!</i>

15:27.000 --> 15:29.878
<i>Relax, it's like... a water slide...</i>

15:31.320 --> 15:34.756
<i>... without the water!
Or the slide.</i>

16:01.600 --> 16:03.352
A world of trash!

16:06.680 --> 16:08.398
It is awesome.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.075
Zombies!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.959
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!

16:34.000 --> 16:35.353
I know karate!

16:35.960 --> 16:37.393
Well, at least on the Wii.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.115
No! I don't... I don't...
I don't want any trouble.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.798
I'm just trying to find my mom.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.430
- I want to find my mom.
- Mom?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.550
Don't you understand? My mom.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.559
- Mom? Mom!
- Yeah, my mom.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.149
No, my mom. She's the one
that feeds me. She feeds me...

16:59.360 --> 17:03.194
- Feem? Feem?
- Yeah, my mom. She feeds me.

17:04.119 --> 17:07.237
No, no, she... she...
she washes my clothes.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.589
She washes my clothes.
You know, my...

17:11.640 --> 17:13.790
No, my... No, she... she...

17:14.680 --> 17:16.636
My mom. She vacuums the house.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.397
You know, she vacuums the house.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.513
Yeah, she's the one...

17:24.520 --> 17:25.794
No.

17:25.839 --> 17:30.550
No. No, that's not it.
Stop. No! My... my mom.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.477
She's the one that...
She tucks me in at night.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.632
She tucks me in? My mom?

17:40.520 --> 17:41.953
Can you... can you?

17:43.360 --> 17:44.429
No. No!

17:44.480 --> 17:46.675
No, you can't...
What are you doing?!

17:46.720 --> 17:48.278
Let go of me.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.231
<i>OK. All right. Chill out, Chachi.</i>

18:09.280 --> 18:11.316
<i>You seriously don't want to get
dropped right now.</i>

18:11.360 --> 18:12.873
You!

18:12.920 --> 18:15.150
You sent me down a
trash chute, you jerk!

18:15.200 --> 18:18.829
<i>Yeah. Sit back,
relax and enjoy the ride.</i>

18:39.840 --> 18:42.434
<i>Prepare to disembark the aircraft.
Let him down easy, TwoCat.</i>

19:16.200 --> 19:18.236
- Hello?
- You like video games, man?

19:18.280 --> 19:20.271
Check it out. Space flight simulator.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.637
I programmed it from the manual
so it's just like the real thing.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.118
I'm just messing with you.
Hey, brother!

19:35.160 --> 19:38.072
Yeah. You're not a Martian.
You're a kid.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.113
Man, it's been so long since
I've seen another kid.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.589
Hey!

19:42.640 --> 19:45.074
I'm excited, too, buddy.
My name is Gribble.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.588
Gribble the First.
What's your handle?

19:47.640 --> 19:49.676
No, wait, let me guess. Maverick.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.438
- No.
- Wolfman?

19:51.480 --> 19:52.469
- No.
- Iceman.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.519
<i>- No.
- Did you see Top Gun?</i>

19:54.560 --> 19:58.633
- It's Milo.
- Milo. How low can you go, Milo?

19:58.680 --> 20:01.274
How 'bout I call you "My Bro"?
Check it.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.591
You're a person...

20:03.640 --> 20:05.517
...from Earth!
- Shut up!

20:05.560 --> 20:07.152
What, are you crazy?

20:07.200 --> 20:10.317
I'm part of Ronald Reagan's
secret astronaut programme.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.794
The Secronauts.
You might have heard of us.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.229
We're here to stop the threat
of interplanetary Communism

20:15.280 --> 20:16.759
throughout the galaxy.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.519
Why else do you think
they call it "the Red Planet"?

20:23.360 --> 20:25.351
I do crazy stuff like
that all the time, man.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.231
You're gonna have so much fun here.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.068
It's wobbly and shaky here.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.596
Come on! I wanna show you something.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.437
You gotta move pretty fast
to keep up with me, buddy.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.072
- Wait.
- Come on down!

20:42.360 --> 20:43.713
Hey, check my room out, bro!

20:46.680 --> 20:48.159
Oh, man.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.475
You're not used to the low gravity yet?

20:50.520 --> 20:52.636
OK, OK, OK. Don't worry, man.
I can totally fix that.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.673
I can fix anything.
There we go. I got an extra.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.472
Listen, I just wanna try
and find my mom.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.589
This'll hold you down.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.359
- What is it?
- Right here. OK? I'm gonna patent it,

21:02.400 --> 21:05.597
call it the Gribblemeister 3000.
It's working, right? That's awesome.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.394
I wanna show you something cool.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.158
- What?
- Hold on tight. Banzai!

21:12.480 --> 21:13.799
The weight belt helping you?

21:16.280 --> 21:17.269
Check this out, man.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.312
They're trying to figure out
how you escaped. Watch this.

21:21.880 --> 21:26.829
Oh, my word! I cannot get out! Help me!

21:28.200 --> 21:30.475
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.877
You wanna hear what they're saying?
Sure you do.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.354
Wait. Gribble, I wanna find my mom.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.949
TwoCat! That is disgusting.
Here we go.

21:43.000 --> 21:43.955
What is that?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.752
- That's a translator.
- Wait.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.150
<i>- Supervisor not likee.
- Getting off me, you Martian!</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:51.191
<i>Unauthorised dogpile!</i>

21:51.240 --> 21:54.789
- "Unauthorised dogpile"?
- I know. They say that all the time.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.478
Come with me, man. This is so cool.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.037
Hey! Come on in.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.074
What do you think, bro?

22:04.680 --> 22:06.716
- About what?
- About the room, bud.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.751
It's for you, man.
What do you think?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.870
- For me?
- Oh, don't mind this guy.

22:11.640 --> 22:17.078
I just tried to train him to be like my
wingman, you know, but he's useless.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.678
It's more like a wing nut.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.393
Oh, gosh.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.239
I'm gonna get rid of him.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.157
But forget it, man. That's all history.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.475
- 'Cause I got you now!
- Me?

22:29.520 --> 22:31.272
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?

22:31.320 --> 22:33.197
I'm talking about you and me, bro.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.755
Best buds hanging out forever.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.634
Playing video games all day,
watching TV all night.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.274
There's no such thing
as too much TV, man.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.435
Mom?

22:47.400 --> 22:48.719
Oh, yeah.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.992
Maybe there is such a thing
as too much TV.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.110
- No. Wait.
- I wanna show you something in here.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.912
What are they saying?

22:56.360 --> 22:58.237
<i>Subject will be terminating.</i>

22:58.280 --> 23:00.555
<i>- Oh-four, oh-three...
- "Terminating." Terminating?</i>

23:00.600 --> 23:02.238
Terminating. I love that movie.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.236
Hey, you know what? Let's go. I wanna
show you something cool, dude.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.157
No, wait. Gribble, what's going on?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.998
I don't wanna tell ya,
and you can't make me. OK?

23:09.040 --> 23:10.871
- Just forget about it.
- No, Gribble, tell me.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.992
- Please!
- System overload! System overload!

23:14.040 --> 23:16.952
- Tell me!
- Help! Hey!

23:17.000 --> 23:18.433
- Tell me!
- Oh, my...

23:19.240 --> 23:21.754
Get... Uncle! Get off!

23:25.720 --> 23:27.039
Chafe-y.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.509
All right.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.509
All right, I'll tell you.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.279
Fact is...

23:37.280 --> 23:38.759
...Mars needs moms.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.990
What the heck does that mean?

23:47.240 --> 23:49.435
These are hatchlings.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.677
They are baby Martians,
and they pop out of the ground,

23:52.720 --> 23:55.712
like potatoes,
every 25 years or so.

23:55.760 --> 24:00.390
And the Martians, they're terrible
at mothering, which is ironic, really,

24:00.440 --> 24:03.637
since the ones running the place
upstairs, they're all female.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.558
- Can you get to the point?
- I... All right.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.431
What they are good at
is building robots, right?

24:10.480 --> 24:13.677
So they build these Nanny-bots
to raise the girls.

24:13.720 --> 24:17.554
And each Nanny-bot gets one kid
to raise, and then it's toast.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.350
It can't be reused after that.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.550
Who knew mothering was so hard?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.108
"Hard?"

24:26.720 --> 24:29.029
- So why did they take my mom?
- OK.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.311
They have to program the
Nanny-bots each time, right?

24:32.920 --> 24:35.753
So... they find someone

24:35.800 --> 24:39.190
who is really good
at controlling their own kid.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.234
Hey, that's my house.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.272
And that's me!
Are these my mom's memories?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.194
Yeah.

24:49.520 --> 24:53.308
See, all these Martians care about
is order and discipline.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.875
What was that one about?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.195
Just tell me what they're
gonna do to my mom.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.033
All right.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.639
Right up there.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.712
You see, they have this
memory extraction machine.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.916
It takes the discipline
out of the mom

25:17.960 --> 25:20.315
and it puts it into the Nanny-bots.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.395
It works on some kind of
solar-wind focusing system.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.352
And when the sun rises...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.719
...they extract what they need to
program the Nanny-bots, and that's it.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.239
OK? That's it.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.435
Wait. So my mom is gonna
lose all her memories?

25:44.880 --> 25:46.438
Yeah, something like that.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.516
No, that... that can't happen.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.994
- We've gotta save her!
- Well, that's impossible,

25:52.040 --> 25:54.713
- so, like, get over it and move on.
- But we've gotta try.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.069
- We've gotta try!
- This, my friend,

25:57.120 --> 25:59.156
is a Martian wristwatch.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.272
You see the bars here?
Counts down to sunrise.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.518
So you must have
about 6.93 Earth hours left.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.911
Less than seven hours? That's all?

26:09.960 --> 26:11.916
Let's say that,
for the sake of argument,

26:11.960 --> 26:13.837
that we do, we disguise you.

26:13.880 --> 26:17.839
And we use all this awesome spy gear

26:17.880 --> 26:20.633
to guide you up to the surface.

26:20.680 --> 26:24.229
Those Martians, man, they...
They're gonna spot you.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.796
They're gonna chase you
and shoot at you and... and... and...

26:29.960 --> 26:31.598
Wait a minute.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.433
I think it's a brilliant idea.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.868
But you just said
they're gonna shoot at me.

26:38.920 --> 26:42.629
What? Oh, hey. What you talking about,
"shoot"? "Shoot"? That's crazy talk.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.877
- That's what you said.
- Who said that?

26:45.920 --> 26:48.878
Someone say he's gonna shoot at him?
What are you talking about, brother?

26:48.920 --> 26:51.673
No one's shooting at anybody.
Don't even sweat it.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.756
You trust me.
This is gonna be great.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.952
No, you know what?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.037
As a matter of fact,
this is gonna be...

27:00.840 --> 27:04.196
...Gribbletastic. Yeah!

27:09.680 --> 27:12.274
I don't know, Gribble.
Are you sure this is gonna work?

27:12.320 --> 27:14.914
<i>Yeah, dude. It's gonna be awesome.</i>

27:14.960 --> 27:18.111
<i>That disguise totally rocks.
Trust me, you're gonna blend right in.</i>

27:18.160 --> 27:19.912
<i>Even the SISS won't spot you.</i>

27:19.960 --> 27:22.474
The SISS? What's the SISS?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.556
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention them.</i>

27:24.600 --> 27:27.512
They're the Supervisor's
Secret Security.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.835
They're the ones
in the black uniforms.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.552
But I'll take care of them, man.
Don't worry about it.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.636
<i>Anything else you "forgot to mention"?</i>

27:33.680 --> 27:36.353
What? No. What're you... Me?

27:36.400 --> 27:40.632
Dude, honest Injun, man.
We're in this together.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.075
Once he gets up top,
he's gonna give himself away.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.236
They're gonna chase him
halfway around Mars,

27:46.280 --> 27:47.793
and I'm gonna save his butt.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.991
And he's gonna be so totally grateful.
It's gonna be so cool.

27:52.760 --> 27:53.909
Give me a break.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.678
OK, OK. So, it's a... it's a fib,

27:57.720 --> 27:59.597
but it's for his own good, man.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.798
After this, he'll stay down here,
where it's safe.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.794
<i>OK, go ahead.</i>

28:57.160 --> 29:00.789
<i>Dude, you march like a girl!
Which is kind of perfect.</i>

29:01.080 --> 29:04.755
There's that bleached-prune lady again.
Who is that?

29:04.800 --> 29:07.758
<i>That's the Supervisor.
She's like the school lunch lady,</i>

29:07.800 --> 29:10.439
<i>only with the power
to execute you on sight.</i>

29:10.480 --> 29:12.436
Man, Mars needs Botox.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.595
<i>Don't mess with her.
She runs everything around here.</i>

29:20.640 --> 29:22.437
Gribble, are you seeing this?

29:22.480 --> 29:24.835
<i>Yeah, man. Those tags are so cool.</i>

29:24.880 --> 29:28.236
<i>I don't know who does 'em,
but the Supervisor hates 'em.</i>

29:28.280 --> 29:30.157
<i>Oh, hey, look sharp, man.</i>

29:30.600 --> 29:33.592
<i>You see that tall building up ahead?
That's the Citadel.</i>

29:33.640 --> 29:35.551
<i>Your mom's up at the top.</i>

29:35.600 --> 29:37.318
<i>You get up there and get your mom.</i>

29:37.360 --> 29:39.157
<i>I am gonna program the ship</i>

29:39.200 --> 29:41.953
<i>and make it repeat its last
Earth mission, and then, boom!</i>

29:42.000 --> 29:45.310
<i>You're through the wormhole and home
in time for Pop-Tarts. OK? Easy.</i>

29:47.080 --> 29:49.753
TwoCat, this is it, man.
They're gonna spot him here for sure.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.869
Stop it. Don't look at me like that.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.319
I'm gonna take care of him.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.073
Check it out, all right?

29:59.120 --> 30:01.839
When he gets to the checkpoint gate,
he's gonna trigger the alarm,

30:01.880 --> 30:04.189
the guards'll close in,
I'm gonna press this button.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.879
The cleaning hatch is gonna open, gonna
drop down to the maintenance floor,

30:06.920 --> 30:10.959
where he can escape down the
trash chute. See? It's very simple.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.151
<i>OK. It'll all be fine.</i>

30:20.200 --> 30:25.672
<i>But if anything, you know,
weird or unexpected happens,</i>

30:25.720 --> 30:27.631
<i>just run like crazy, OK?</i>

30:34.760 --> 30:36.113
You see?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.313
Totally in my control.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.755
I pushed the wrong one.
Oh, my gosh!

30:47.400 --> 30:50.597
Oh, no, no, no, no!

30:58.360 --> 31:00.078
Gribble, where are they taking me?

31:00.120 --> 31:01.473
<i>OK, just give me a minute.</i>

31:01.520 --> 31:03.112
<i>Don't have an aneurysm.</i>

31:04.880 --> 31:08.634
<i>Oh, man, OK, you're going up,
and that's not good.</i>

31:09.160 --> 31:10.832
I thought I wanted to go up?

31:10.880 --> 31:12.518
<i>Well, yes and no.</i>

31:12.560 --> 31:14.869
<i>This is a very, very bad up.</i>

31:16.280 --> 31:18.669
<i>OK, OK, OK... don't panic.</i>

31:18.720 --> 31:20.756
<i>- Get ready.
- For what?</i>

31:22.720 --> 31:25.029
<i>How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!</i>

31:26.480 --> 31:29.392
And he's off! Yes! Finally.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.876
Gribble! Which way now?

31:34.200 --> 31:35.952
<i>- Dang, I'm good!
- Gribble!</i>

31:36.000 --> 31:39.356
<i>I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side</i>

31:39.400 --> 31:42.039
<i>Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...</i>

31:42.080 --> 31:44.799
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot
and tell me which way!

31:45.720 --> 31:46.994
Did you just call me an idiot?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.712
Which way? I'm lost here!

31:48.760 --> 31:51.274
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

31:51.320 --> 31:53.788
<i>I think that you have to apologise now.</i>

31:53.840 --> 31:55.319
Gribble!

31:55.360 --> 31:56.952
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

31:57.000 --> 31:58.638
All right, all right, I'm sorry!

31:58.680 --> 32:00.159
<i>Apology accepted. Go left.</i>

32:01.640 --> 32:05.189
<i>No, no, no, no, not that left!
Not that left, not that left!</i>

32:05.240 --> 32:06.309
<i>Back up, man!</i>

32:10.680 --> 32:13.672
<i>- Turn it down, Gribble!
- TwoCat, turn off your alarm!</i>

32:13.720 --> 32:16.917
<i>What is going on here? TwoCat?</i>

32:17.400 --> 32:19.994
<i>Oh, no. Mommy? Mommy!</i>

32:25.880 --> 32:27.598
Gribble! I need to know...

32:27.640 --> 32:29.392
Gribble, come in. Are you there?

32:30.360 --> 32:33.636
Gribble! Come on, Gribble, this
is no time for the silent treatment!

32:43.640 --> 32:45.153
Gribble? Help me.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.155
I'm trapped,
and there's nowhere to hide!

32:51.320 --> 32:52.435
Gribble!

34:45.760 --> 34:48.672
If not using ropes, my friend,
you will needing wings.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.513
We must cleaning paint off you
before someone is seeing you.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.027
It will getting you in trouble.
Giving me your helmet...

34:58.280 --> 34:59.793
The Earth hatchling!

35:01.000 --> 35:03.833
Gribble! Gribble, come in. They've
spotted me! But I think I lost them!

35:07.320 --> 35:09.515
Get off me! Let me go! Let me go!

35:09.560 --> 35:12.393
Cool it! I gotta clean you up!

35:12.440 --> 35:14.510
- Get off of me!
- Hey!

35:14.560 --> 35:17.677
Mellow out, man!
I'm not the fuzz!

35:17.720 --> 35:19.711
- I'm not bustin' you.
- You're not?

35:19.760 --> 35:21.557
Check it out!

35:22.160 --> 35:23.434
What is that?

35:24.320 --> 35:26.675
- They were tracking me?
- Not you.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.950
They were trackin'
whoever you were chattin' with.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.911
Who I was... who I was talk...

35:30.960 --> 35:33.076
I was talking to Gribble! Oh, no!

35:36.880 --> 35:39.314
No time! Sorry! No time!

35:54.280 --> 35:55.269
You got time now?

35:57.120 --> 35:58.951
This is so low temperature!

35:59.520 --> 36:02.114
OK. You're from Earth,
so you must know...

36:02.160 --> 36:05.835
What do you "turn on"?
How do you "tune in"?

36:05.880 --> 36:07.552
What do you "drop out" of?

36:09.280 --> 36:11.271
What powers do flowers have?

36:12.800 --> 36:14.950
That's English!
Where did you learn English?

36:16.680 --> 36:18.159
Two quarters ago,

36:18.200 --> 36:20.236
<i>I was working in the
administration block.</i>

36:21.520 --> 36:25.513
<i>The Supervisor was talking
with 113-Elder-331.</i>

36:25.560 --> 36:28.791
<i>They were viewing some
top-secret Earth documents.</i>

36:28.840 --> 36:32.389
<i>When they left, I wanted to check out
what was making the weird light.</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:33.953
<i>What's going on here?</i>

36:35.840 --> 36:38.479
<i>It's a chrysanthemum, baby.</i>

36:38.520 --> 36:39.748
<i>A chrysanthemum?</i>

36:39.800 --> 36:42.314
<i>That's not a chrysanthemum.</i>

36:42.360 --> 36:43.509
<i>And it was...</i>

36:45.200 --> 36:47.509
<i>... amazing!
So I copied all I could.</i>

36:54.480 --> 36:57.597
<i>The way that light vibrated and sang!</i>

36:57.640 --> 37:00.473
<i>Nothing in my world
has ever made me feel like that!</i>

37:00.520 --> 37:03.193
<i>It was like my eyes were open
for the first time.</i>

37:05.160 --> 37:07.674
<i>It was crazy beautiful, man.</i>

37:08.920 --> 37:11.832
<i>This is a chrysanthemum.</i>

37:12.000 --> 37:15.197
<i>Flower power, it's gonna change
the world, man!</i>

37:15.240 --> 37:17.196
<i>Yeah, that's just groovy, man.</i>

37:17.240 --> 37:19.515
<i>They called it...</i>

37:19.560 --> 37:20.913
Colour.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.190
Your hippie alien life story
is totally interesting,

37:25.240 --> 37:28.277
but I'm kinda busy
saving my mom!

37:29.360 --> 37:31.157
You mean your Nanny-bot.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.876
No! I mean my mom!
She's a human being!

37:35.320 --> 37:38.312
Wait. No, but...
I saw inside her headspace.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.191
You said, "My life
would be so much better

37:40.240 --> 37:42.037
if I didn't have a mom at all."

37:42.840 --> 37:46.389
I know what I said,
but I was wrong, and I do want her.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.556
Heavy! Why?

37:49.840 --> 37:50.955
Because she...

37:51.000 --> 37:53.594
She looks after me
and she tells me what to do!

37:54.320 --> 37:56.436
Oh, like the Supervisor!

37:57.080 --> 38:00.993
No, not like the Supervisor!
My mom is kind.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.711
She takes me to Disneyland,
and she reads to me,

38:04.760 --> 38:07.274
and she makes me hot chocolate,

38:07.320 --> 38:11.632
and she puts bandages on my cuts,
and she hugs me and she...

38:15.160 --> 38:18.709
She loves me.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.749
"Love"?

38:22.840 --> 38:23.909
Chute number three.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.839
Crazy.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.677
Gribble? Can you hear me now?

38:53.160 --> 38:54.149
Gribble?

38:57.280 --> 38:58.315
Oh, no.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.155
Gribble?

39:13.440 --> 39:14.714
Gribble?

39:17.840 --> 39:18.875
Gribble?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.349
Gribble!

39:26.520 --> 39:28.954
Oh, no. That's only
five and a half hours!

39:32.920 --> 39:34.273
Stupid weights.

39:44.640 --> 39:49.430
"Private. Keep out.
No Martians allowed."

40:10.800 --> 40:11.994
"Gribble."

40:14.520 --> 40:16.192
"George Ribble."

40:21.080 --> 40:23.355
He must've been a kid, too,
when he came here.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.071
Why wouldn't he tell me?

40:28.040 --> 40:30.270
TwoCat? TwoCat!

40:32.400 --> 40:33.753
Hold on, buddy.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.398
Are you OK?

40:41.440 --> 40:45.911
Oh, here. Where's Gribble, TwoCat?
I gotta find him!

40:45.960 --> 40:49.236
He's the only person on this entire
planet who can help me save my mom.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.793
That burnt area. That's where
they shoot people, isn't it?

40:58.840 --> 41:01.593
That's a firing squad,
and they're gonna shoot Gribble?

41:02.080 --> 41:03.433
TwoCat, we gotta save him!

41:03.480 --> 41:05.755
Ladies, ladies,
you don't wanna do this.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.631
Listen, I'm a walking A-bomb!

41:07.680 --> 41:09.875
You shoot me, and the
whole planet's gonna go up!

41:09.920 --> 41:11.433
You don't want that
on your conscience...

41:11.480 --> 41:13.789
OK, seriously.
OK, you could be precipitating

41:13.840 --> 41:17.879
a major interplanetary war here,
people, aliens, Martians.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.831
OK, listen! I've been
living in your sewers for years.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.871
I'm disgusting,
they're contaminated,

41:23.920 --> 41:26.388
and they need a vaccine
and I'm the only one that has it.

41:29.840 --> 41:33.594
OK. Listen. You made your point.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.392
I invented some great stuff!

41:35.440 --> 41:37.431
I can let you in on
the ground floor, OK?

41:37.480 --> 41:39.596
How 'bout blue mascara?

41:39.640 --> 41:42.552
I've got a Slinky!
A Rubik's Cube?

41:44.600 --> 41:47.068
<i>You like Dungeons and Dragons,
I love Dungeons and Dragons.</i>

41:47.120 --> 41:51.193
How 'bout skateboards?
I got millions... OK. Hey!

41:51.240 --> 41:54.630
I can get you a Cabbage Patch Kid. Not
one of those gnarly ones, a real one.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.557
What about a pizza?

41:56.600 --> 41:59.637
You like crop circles?
I have quite a crop.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.636
Oh, and I'll teach you how to moonwalk.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.749
Can't really do it in these chains.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.638
Legwarmers!

42:07.960 --> 42:09.678
Wait, wait.
We're really gonna do this?

42:14.240 --> 42:15.639
Unauthorised dogpile!

42:27.040 --> 42:29.076
Hey! Milo, what are you doing here?

42:29.120 --> 42:30.633
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?

42:32.280 --> 42:34.077
It's exactly according to my plan!

42:44.440 --> 42:45.475
Ki!

43:19.920 --> 43:22.115
Hot, hot, hot!

43:22.160 --> 43:24.390
Wait! Stop it with the shooting!

43:31.400 --> 43:34.198
My toe! What are you doing?
Oh, my gosh!

43:35.640 --> 43:38.438
When you're going
to shoot a laser at someone,

43:38.480 --> 43:41.756
you should bring them
a change of underwear!

44:05.440 --> 44:07.237
Hairy Tribe Guys.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.999
Wingnut?

44:15.560 --> 44:20.350
- OK. OK. Thank you.
- Oh, come on. Let go!

44:21.720 --> 44:25.838
- Let go! What are you doing?
- They're hugging!

44:25.880 --> 44:29.998
It's all these males ever do! That's why
the females chuck 'em down here!

44:30.040 --> 44:33.828
We don't have time!
The SISS are gonna find us!

44:36.520 --> 44:37.919
- Run!
- Run!

44:51.280 --> 44:53.396
Wingnut! It's Wingnut!

44:56.280 --> 44:59.556
OK. Come on! Come on.

44:59.600 --> 45:00.635
What?!

45:05.080 --> 45:07.150
Wingnut! No!

45:23.880 --> 45:25.029
Wait!

45:25.560 --> 45:27.676
Gribble!

45:31.000 --> 45:33.150
Relax, Grib. Fat floats.

45:34.360 --> 45:35.475
Hey!

45:51.480 --> 45:54.916
Oh, nuts.
There goes my sexy tan.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.552
Less than three and a half hours.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.915
Echo!

46:05.280 --> 46:07.350
This place is amazing!

46:09.360 --> 46:11.237
It's Gribbletastic.

46:11.280 --> 46:15.398
You have got to stop saying that.
You sound Gribblediculous.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.034
Hey, hey.
TwoCat's homing in on our headsets.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.996
I built him with a location device.

46:21.040 --> 46:22.439
I think of everything.

46:23.680 --> 46:27.116
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.594
Stretch... stretch that bar
across this rock.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good, good, good.

46:35.680 --> 46:39.593
You know this place is perfect?
We can rebuild right over there.

46:39.640 --> 46:40.675
- You see that?
- No.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.711
- Keep still.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.038
Build a whole new lair.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.389
Be years before we fill
this place up with our junk.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.312
What do you say, pal?
You and me? Best buds?

46:51.360 --> 46:53.237
You can be emperor this time.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.353
<i>And I... I shall be El Presidente.</i>

46:57.400 --> 46:58.799
Hey!

47:01.640 --> 47:05.428
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this!

47:06.280 --> 47:08.157
- Gimme that!
- But...

47:08.200 --> 47:10.873
Maniac!
These things are dangerous!

47:11.800 --> 47:15.679
Tried to blow up some trash once with
one of these, almost took my foot off!

47:15.720 --> 47:17.119
Yes!

47:19.000 --> 47:20.399
Oh, good, it's nearly empty.

47:20.440 --> 47:24.592
Anyway, why don't we go rebuild
right over here. What do you think?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.676
That lava slope looks
like our best way up.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.358
My mom's running out of time, Gribble.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.436
- Let's go!
- Hey, no, come on!

47:30.480 --> 47:31.993
It can't be done!

47:33.600 --> 47:35.875
Did you see what happened up there?

47:36.440 --> 47:38.192
Man, I nearly got toasted!

47:39.680 --> 47:40.874
To death!

47:43.360 --> 47:47.148
Thanks for saving me, but... I'm
never going up there again, man.

47:47.200 --> 47:50.556
You... You can't!
You can't just bail on me now!

47:50.600 --> 47:52.397
Bye.

47:53.480 --> 47:54.469
George!

47:56.440 --> 47:58.271
Your name's George!

48:03.960 --> 48:07.669
- What did you just call me?
- George.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.309
George Ribble.

48:12.640 --> 48:15.438
- You were a kid, like me!
- Where did you get this?

48:15.480 --> 48:16.833
This is mine.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.830
They took your mom, too, didn't they?

48:21.040 --> 48:23.270
It's OK, Grib, I know how you feel!

48:23.920 --> 48:28.118
How I feel? How I feel...

48:30.520 --> 48:32.954
You have no idea how I feel.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.478
You see this?

48:39.640 --> 48:41.437
This is when they chose my mom.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.317
But way before they chose yours.

48:47.520 --> 48:50.512
I know, Gribble.
It happened to me the same way.

48:50.560 --> 48:53.916
No. No, you don't know.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.352
How could you possibly know?

48:58.480 --> 49:00.550
I was a good kid.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.071
I did my chores.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.156
Put my things away.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.111
I did as I was told.

49:09.920 --> 49:12.275
Turns out,
that's exactly why they chose her.

49:13.680 --> 49:14.954
'Cause of me.

49:17.560 --> 49:21.917
Man. What kind of message is that
to send to a little kid?

49:24.560 --> 49:26.755
I know. It's not fair!

49:29.240 --> 49:31.276
I'll tell you what's not fair, man.

49:34.560 --> 49:37.836
<i>Not fair is when a bunch
of scary aliens take your mama,</i>

49:37.880 --> 49:40.872
<i>your only parent, away from you
in the middle of the night.</i>

49:42.400 --> 49:45.676
<i>Not fair is when you follow them,
and you sneak onto their ship,</i>

49:45.720 --> 49:48.917
<i>and you search
but you can't find her.</i>

49:49.960 --> 49:51.916
<i>And then you see her...</i>

49:51.960 --> 49:54.315
<i>They got your mama strapped
into some kind of machine.</i>

49:56.880 --> 49:58.233
Mom!

49:59.800 --> 50:02.473
<i>So I grabbed a couple
of breathing helmets,</i>

50:02.520 --> 50:03.953
<i>and I went to get her.</i>

50:06.840 --> 50:09.274
<i>But I didn't know what I know now.
I didn't know...</i>

50:10.240 --> 50:13.550
<i>... that when the sun came up,
it'd start the machine.</i>

50:14.960 --> 50:18.396
<i>I didn't know... what that
machine was gonna do to her.</i>

50:23.880 --> 50:25.598
<i>Not until it was too late.</i>

50:28.080 --> 50:29.513
<i>And then I realised...</i>

50:32.680 --> 50:33.829
<i>... I was all alone.</i>

50:35.400 --> 50:37.550
<i>I'd never see my mom again.</i>

50:41.800 --> 50:43.870
And I'd never be able
to tell her I loved her.

50:47.360 --> 50:51.069
"Never be able to tell her you
love her..." What do you mean?

50:59.680 --> 51:01.671
No, no, you don't have
to worry about that.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.439
It's not gonna happen.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.759
Not this time.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.435
Not to you.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.796
We're gonna go up there
and we're gonna...

51:16.440 --> 51:17.793
We're gonna go get your mom.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.471
Really? You mean it?

51:22.520 --> 51:25.273
Yeah. You and me, buddy.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.588
Best buds, right?

51:33.040 --> 51:35.873
- Thank you, Gribble.
- Yeah, man.

51:37.240 --> 51:39.231
Yeah, we'll get your mom back, man.

51:40.160 --> 51:41.752
"Best buds."

51:43.560 --> 51:45.437
That's like the "love" thing, right?

51:46.640 --> 51:48.949
My, my, my, my...

51:49.000 --> 51:50.911
...my, my Sharona!

51:51.520 --> 51:54.512
- No! Gribble!
- Evasive action!

51:55.200 --> 51:56.349
I'm sorry.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.995
- No, Gribble! Gribble, stop! Relax!
- Don't shoot me, please!

52:00.040 --> 52:04.033
Gribble, Gribble! Relax! Listen!
She's not gonna shoot you!

52:04.080 --> 52:05.798
- She's not gonna shoot you!
- She's not?

52:05.840 --> 52:07.239
No! She's the one
that helped us escape!

52:07.280 --> 52:08.235
She is?

52:08.280 --> 52:10.350
- TwoCat brought her.
- He did?

52:10.400 --> 52:13.597
I used to be administration
unit 231-Ki-312.

52:14.480 --> 52:18.393
But now,
I'm down with your scene, man.

52:19.800 --> 52:21.791
What is she talking about?

52:21.840 --> 52:23.910
I don't know.
She talks like that a lot.

52:23.960 --> 52:25.439
But I think she wants
to help us, right?

52:25.480 --> 52:29.234
Right on! Come on!
We gotta beat feet!

52:29.280 --> 52:30.633
"Beat feet"?

52:31.240 --> 52:33.515
Oh, you mean run! Yeah, we do!

52:33.560 --> 52:35.437
- Yeah!
- All right, Gribble, let's go!

52:35.480 --> 52:37.914
- OK! Come on!
- It's just so weird!

52:38.560 --> 52:41.074
Come on, guys!
This is the way out!

52:41.120 --> 52:43.156
Is there gonna be a lot of running?

52:47.800 --> 52:51.270
Psychedelic! What are they?

52:51.320 --> 52:54.471
They're paintings.
You know, like your flower graffiti.

52:55.680 --> 52:58.399
Wait! Wait, wait! Ki, Ki!

52:58.920 --> 53:00.717
Hold on. You're the one...

53:01.680 --> 53:03.511
...that paints those flower tags?

53:04.040 --> 53:05.758
That is so bad!

53:07.600 --> 53:11.195
Bad? But... but it is meant to be good.

53:11.240 --> 53:14.869
No. No, no, I mean... no.
Bad means good. I just,

53:14.920 --> 53:18.037
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...

53:20.520 --> 53:24.479
I think that...
I think you're amazing.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.315
Gribble!

53:29.040 --> 53:31.508
- You can change colour!
- What?

53:32.560 --> 53:36.109
That is also..."bad".

53:42.920 --> 53:44.239
What is that?

53:44.280 --> 53:49.115
That? It looks like a family.
Kids and parents.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.155
That's the "love" thing.

53:52.760 --> 53:55.354
What are "parents"?

53:55.400 --> 53:59.359
You know, people like my mom,
who look after kids like me?

53:59.400 --> 54:01.550
I guess you guys had families once.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.397
You know, if you Martians had parents,

54:03.440 --> 54:06.273
you wouldn't have to kidnap moms
to program your Nanny-bots.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.598
- Come on.
- But...

54:08.640 --> 54:12.189
But the Supervisor said that Martians
have always been raised by machines.

54:12.240 --> 54:15.869
Wow, looks like she
lied to you, big time.

54:26.520 --> 54:27.919
We never knew.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.149
That's the Citadel.

54:33.760 --> 54:34.795
We've got to get to the top.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.149
That's where mission control is,
on the surface.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.395
Your mom is in
the Extraction Machine here.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.079
And your ride back to Earth
is in the silo here.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.553
That's all well and good, guys,

54:43.600 --> 54:45.397
but I don't think we're
gonna make it to the Citadel.

54:46.720 --> 54:48.711
Why are they checking everyone?

54:48.760 --> 54:51.479
Well, you're kind of
a celebrity now, buddy.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.554
And who is that handsome devil
next to you?

54:57.040 --> 54:58.189
You better keep your heads down.

54:59.240 --> 55:01.879
If they bust you,
they will slap you in the joint!

55:01.920 --> 55:05.196
Wait a minute. That's exactly
where we wanna go!

55:05.240 --> 55:07.276
Yeah! He's right on!

55:07.760 --> 55:10.479
What? What... Hey!
We're going to jail?

55:10.520 --> 55:13.318
No, no. When they first found me,
they brought me straight to jail.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.316
The jail's next to the silo
where they keep the spaceship!

55:15.360 --> 55:17.510
- OK.
- Sub-level two. Go ahead.

55:17.560 --> 55:20.791
If we can get through the jail,
and up through the silo,

55:20.840 --> 55:23.434
we can get to the surface.
And that's where Mom is.

55:24.440 --> 55:27.671
Yes, but isn't the jail
thousands of feet above us?

55:27.720 --> 55:29.756
One thousand and thirty-two!

55:35.520 --> 55:37.875
Wait! Wait a minute.
How strong is this line?

55:37.920 --> 55:41.276
I'm a little over my
goal weight right now. Hey!

55:50.040 --> 55:53.350
OK. We've got to take out the guards,
shut down the surveillance cameras,

55:53.400 --> 55:56.233
then we can sneak through the jail
and get to the silo.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.555
<i>We catching the two terrorists.</i>

56:00.600 --> 56:03.068
<i>Supervisor ordering we must
locking them in cells.</i>

56:03.840 --> 56:05.034
Is this gonna work?

56:11.400 --> 56:13.675
- No, wait.
- No! No, please, please, no!

56:13.720 --> 56:15.711
I don't wanna go back to jail! Please!

56:15.760 --> 56:17.512
No, no, please! No!

56:17.560 --> 56:20.074
I need a doctor and I've got measles!

56:20.120 --> 56:23.271
And I've got gingivitis!
And I've got male pattern baldness.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.675
I will getting prisoner tranquilizers.
Where are they?

56:25.720 --> 56:27.870
- Bottom left control.
- Restless leg syndrome!

56:27.920 --> 56:29.194
I got Saturday Night Fever!

56:29.240 --> 56:31.310
- Bat wing disorder!
- And halitosis!

56:31.360 --> 56:34.318
Yes! Horrible halitosis! I do?

56:36.880 --> 56:39.997
Hey! Awesome!

56:43.200 --> 56:46.795
And this officially ends
today's prison broadcast!

56:50.520 --> 56:53.114
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!

56:53.960 --> 56:56.872
OK, here's the plan.
I'll go get my mom.

56:56.920 --> 56:58.273
You guys fire up the spaceship,

56:58.320 --> 57:00.311
and we'll be outta here
before they can say...

57:01.160 --> 57:03.276
- Hey, Grib, what are you doing?
- It's Wingnut, man!

57:03.320 --> 57:06.039
He's still alive! Hey, bud.
I can't just leave him in here.

57:06.080 --> 57:09.072
OK, well, get him out,
but do it fast! We gotta go!

57:09.120 --> 57:12.556
OK. Come on! This will do it.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.436
Yeah! Come on out, you freakazoid!

57:20.640 --> 57:22.312
I know. I know. It's OK.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.430
What's with all the grabbing
and squeezing?

57:24.480 --> 57:26.516
It's called "hugging".
It's another love thing.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.836
OK, enough already.
Come on! We gotta go!

57:30.360 --> 57:33.033
Man! I must have
opened up all the cells.

57:34.080 --> 57:37.311
- Who let the dogs out?
- No duh.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.155
What?

57:41.240 --> 57:42.229
What's going on?

57:43.280 --> 57:46.238
It's the hatchlings.
They're sorting them.

57:46.280 --> 57:50.159
Yeah. The girls are
all assigned their Nanny-bots.

57:50.200 --> 57:52.191
And the boys are sent down below

57:52.240 --> 57:54.708
where they'll be raised
by the Hairy Tribe Guys.

57:58.280 --> 58:01.113
These guys knew a bunch
of boy hatchlings were coming!

58:01.160 --> 58:04.311
That's why they were dancing down
in the trash. They were celebrating!

58:04.360 --> 58:06.476
Yeah, but all the Hairy Tribe Guys
are up here now.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.993
There's no one down there
to take care of them.

58:10.520 --> 58:12.829
The boys are gonna be all alone.

58:14.040 --> 58:15.678
And to be alone is...

58:16.880 --> 58:18.757
...to be without the crazy love thing.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.075
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys. We gotta go!

58:22.120 --> 58:26.352
Wait. Wait!
Go down the garbage chutes!

58:27.040 --> 58:28.553
Listen, listen! Guys!

58:30.240 --> 58:32.708
If you jump down chute number three,

58:32.760 --> 58:34.751
you can save the hatchlings.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.791
OK? Do you understand?

58:38.360 --> 58:39.509
Chute...

58:41.280 --> 58:43.919
...number... three!
- Come on, Grib.

58:43.960 --> 58:46.520
- One, two, three!
- We gotta go! They'll figure it out!

58:46.560 --> 58:48.755
No, they won't!
They're dumb as a box of rocks.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.952
- Ki. It's no use.
- We gotta go!

58:54.000 --> 58:55.513
Go, Wingnut!

59:06.960 --> 59:10.236
On the other side of the rocket,
there's a ladder up to the surface.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.032
But how do we get past
all those Martians?

59:13.160 --> 59:14.149
I can totally fix that.

59:14.800 --> 59:18.110
Hey, everybody grab a helmet.
Put it on real tight.

59:26.800 --> 59:28.791
Good game. Good game. Good game.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.798
Here. Don't forget that.

59:38.840 --> 59:41.957
Keep in touch, kiddo.
Get up that ladder over there.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.194
Good luck!

59:56.840 --> 59:59.354
Wait a minute! Won't they see me
from Mission Control?

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.356
<i>No way, buddy.
They'll be looking into the rising sun.</i>

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.278
<i>Won't be able to see a thing. By the
time they figure out what's going on,</i>

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.788
<i>we'll be on the couch eating Smurf
Berry Crunch and watching He-Man.</i>

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.559
<i>- Gribble.
- Gribble.</i>

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.831
Yes. And I am Ki. Remember?

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.836
No, I know.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.440
I mean... No, I said that
because, well, you know,

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.995
the ship's got this...
voice-activated launch system.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.156
And I had to record a word,

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.354
and Ki just didn't seem like a word
that would start an engine... you know?

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.279
Except...

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.556
...now that I think about it...

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.989
..."Ki" is like a perfect word
to start an engine

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.830
because it's, you know, used to...

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.717
...unlock things like...

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.712
...my heart.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.194
I dig it when you change colour.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.600
Gribble! Ki! I'm halfway there!

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.035
Oh, no!

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.998
What dummy left that there?

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.352
Milo?

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.074
Gribble, I think I fell into something!

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.154
Gribble, come in!

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.831
<i>- It's OK, Ki. I've got him.
- Great job!</i>

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.996
- Gribble!
- Hey.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.032
<i>- That's the second-to-last lens!
- We're not gonna make it!</i>

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.435
You wanna bet? Yeah!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.195
This thing is going
on my Christmas list!

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.071
Guys! The SISS are gonna
crash Mission Control!

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.078
<i>They'll be through the airlock
and on the surface any minute!</i>

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.680
Oh, no! What do we do?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.756
All right, take her in.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.156
OK. You go save your mom.
I'll take care of the SISS.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.553
- But, Gribble, they're gonna...
- No, no, no.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.559
My mama always said,
"Son, you gotta do the right thing."

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.195
And for the first time since
I came to Mars, I'm doing it.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.830
Man, I hope Ki saw that.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.189
Go get 'em. Fire butt blasters!

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.549
Mom! Mom!
Mom, wake up! Wake up!

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.070
Milo, can you turn the cartoons down?
I'm trying to sleep.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.279
No. Mom, come on. You gotta wake up!
We gotta get out of here!

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.076
Milo, the alarm hasn't even gone off.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.476
Can you just let me sleep until sunrise?

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.112
Believe me, that would be a bad idea.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.433
<i>- Gribble!
- Gribble, Gribble, Gribble.</i>

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.114
Oh, no! I activated the launch system.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.031
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.272
Come on! Come on!

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.235
Come on, Mom. Come on!
We gotta go. Hurry!

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.794
Hurry! Mom, come on! Mom, Mom!

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.390
<i>Milo? The launch system lit up.</i>

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.429
<i>I can't cool it.</i>

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.554
<i>You got two minutes.</i>

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.229
Two minutes! Mom, come on.
We gotta hurry. Mom.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:29.593
Wait a second.
Did you just pull me out of bed?

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.234
No! Mom, Mom.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.876
Mom! Mom, listen.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.115
Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.720
Look at me. I'll explain
everything, but later. OK?

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.796
- Right now we gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.159
- The ship.
- What ship?!

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.715
- That ship!
- Milo! Sixty seconds.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.354
- Get it on!
- Everything's gonna be fine.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.118
- OK.
- Here. Just put this on.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.152
And then you gotta twist this lever
to seal the neck. See? Like this.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.919
- What do you mean?
- We need air. We can't breathe outside.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.554
- There's no air?
- Mom, it's Mars.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.637
OK. One, two, three!

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.398
Help!

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.795
Now, start running! Run!

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.238
Are those Martians?

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.750
Yeah. The hairy guys are good,
and the uniforms are bad.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.032
Let's just hope we don't see...

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.998
...the Supervisor!

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:18.835
No! Mom!
You gave me your helmet?

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.667
No! No! Mom! No! No!

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.359
No! Mom! Mom!

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.755
No! No! No!

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.395
No, Mom! Mom, no! No.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.078
Mommy, you have
to come home with me.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.076
You have to come home with me!

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.031
You're... you're my mom...

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.071
...and I love you!

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.038
No!

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.274
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.154
No!

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.073
Gribble! My mom!

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.549
Bingo.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.230
Milo! I'm coming, buddy!

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.557
I got it. I got it.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.559
Lift her head.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.228
Milo. You saved me.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.237
No. It was Gribble.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.716
No, bro. No, it was you, man.
It was you.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.549
You saved your mom, man.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.874
I'm sorry for what I said before.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.160
My life wouldn't be better without you.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.875
Oh, Milo. My love.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.118
<i>Milo! Gribble!
I've got the ship under control...</i>

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.718
<i>- Ki!
- I'm good.</i>

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.672
<i>- I can buff out the scratches.
- Come on, Mom. We gotta go.</i>

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.631
- We gotta go.
- Oh, OK.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.269
Stopping right there!

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.876
This is not over.
You will surrendering.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.514
Hey! Surrender this!

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.995
Ki! What are you doing?

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.235
I will not letting you do this.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.274
Insolence!

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.756
You cannot stopping this.
This is the way it has always being.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.753
No. No. No!

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.560
This is not the way it is always being.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.718
She lied to us! Look!

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.913
We were not meant
to being raised by machines.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.350
We were meant to be raised by families.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.553
By parents.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.798
We were meant to having that... that...

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.353
That crazy love thing?

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.316
That crazy love thing.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.549
Never!

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.958
You fool. I saved you!

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.036
Before any of you were even born

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.914
I realised we do not have time
to raise hatchlings.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.636
And the males? They never helped.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.240
Always dancing and playing.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.670
That is why we must throw them away.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.633
There must be order.
Arresting the evildoers!

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.635
Evildoer, you.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.830
No! I did this for you!

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.908
I did this for all of you!
You will be sorry. Let me go!

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.829
So are you gonna stay?

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.075
Wow.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.758
Wow...

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.070
Actually, I think I'm gonna...

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.951
You know, Mars is different now.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.519
I'm gonna hang out with Ki and...

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.753
...help paint and stuff.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.829
He's really good at red.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.632
Stop it.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.555
So will I ever see you again?

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.671
What? Are you kidding me? Of course.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.790
We'll keep in touch.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.957
- How?
- What do you mean "how?"

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.278
I could fix it.
It's gonna be Gribbletastic.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.718
Best buds?

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.676
You better believe it.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:53.274
Thank you, Gribble.
Your mother would be proud of you.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.352
It's my pleasure.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.394
Oh, man.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.879
I'm not crying. It's allergies.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.751
Silly.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.398
- Bye! Goodbye!
- Bye.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.071
Bye!

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.671
I love you, Milo.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.160
I know that... now.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.271
- Dad!
- Hi, stinker.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.557
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.870
Did something happen
to Milo this weekend?

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.029
Colour.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.954
<i>Flower power is gonna
change the world, man!</i>

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.196
- Mark.
- No, that's vomit.

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.028
- But I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.911
Well, you're not gonna
make me eat it now, are you?

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.309
Mom!

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.596
My mom. She... she vacuums the house.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.437
You know, she vacuums the house. My...

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.879
Yeah, she's the one.
Yeah, that... No.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.392
I'm just messing with you.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.718
Oh, don't mind this guy. He's a...

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.070
I just tried to train him
to be like my wingman,

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.315
you know, but he's useless.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.755
He's more like a wing nut. Yeah!

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.031
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact,

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.278
this is gonna be... Gribbletastic.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.314
Yeah!

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.239
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.038
And he's off! Yes! Finally.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.676
<i>I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side</i>

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.393
<i>Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...</i>

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.318
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot
and tell me which way!

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.553
Did you just call me an idiot?

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.999
Mark.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.829
- Get... Wait a minute!
- Gribble!

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.550
Let's hit every single pipe
on the way down!

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.352
- Gribble!
- I'm trying!

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.914
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.315
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.629
I think that...

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.512
I think that you're amazing.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.514
Gribble!

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.958
- You can change colour!
- What?

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.559
That is also..."bad".

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.591
- Mark.
- Chute...

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.711
...number... three!

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.035
- One, two, three!
- Come on, Grib. We gotta go!

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.559
- They'll figure it out!
- No, they won't.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.079
They're dumb as a box of rocks.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.955
What dummy left that there?

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.078
No! Mom. Mom!

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.478
Mom. Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.035
Mom, look at me. Look at me.
I'll explain everything, but later. OK?

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.479
Right now we've
just gotta get to the ship.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.669
- The ship?
- The ship.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.438
- What ship?!
- That ship!

01:23:04.305 --> 01:23:10.452
