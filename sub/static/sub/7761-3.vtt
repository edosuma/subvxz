I MEAN, HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
HOW--

01:17.878 --> 01:19.847
HOW COULD I...

01:19.880 --> 01:21.849
BE NEGATIVE?

01:21.882 --> 01:22.850
- LUCK OF THE IRISH?

01:22.883 --> 01:24.318

A JOB, I GUESS.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.133
I BECAME QUITE ADEPT AT

POLISHED THAT PORCELAIN
SO BRIGHT

01:40.801 --> 01:44.272
YOU COULD SEE YOUR FACE

01:44.305 --> 01:45.506

01:45.539 --> 01:48.876
IF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD,

01:48.909 --> 01:50.911
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

01:50.944 --> 01:54.248

02:00.588 --> 02:02.623

I EVEN TOOK SOME LESSONS.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.228

I WASN'T HALF BAD.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.230
OF COURSE,
I WAS PAYING HIM.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.498
- SO SING.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.499
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?
I MEAN, THAT WAS--

02:11.532 --> 02:12.700
THAT WAS JUST A DREAM.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.268
WHAT I NEED
IS SOMETHING PRACTICAL.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.636
- NO, WHAT YOU NEED
IS SOMETHING YOU LOVE.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.638
SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE
YOU FEEL GOOD.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.541

WE'RE JUDGING HIM.

A RECOGNIZABLE FORCE,

03:45.659 --> 03:47.728
WE NEED TO HAVE
A UNIFORM APPEARANCE.

ON THE STREET

03:49.397 --> 03:51.031
BE MORE EFFECTIVE
IF WE WERE LESS NOTICEABLE?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.466

OF DOING IT

03:52.500 --> 03:53.867
IF WE DON'T GET
SOME ATTENTION?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.736
- WE NEED TO LOOK THE PART,

SO THEY KNOW NOT
TO FUCK WITH US.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.781
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ENROLLED
IN BEAUTY SCHOOL.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.351
- DAPHNE AND I STARTED
THE GAY-STRAIGHT ALLIANCE

04:10.384 --> 04:11.385

04:11.419 --> 04:14.288
- I WAS THE STRAIGHT HALF.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.356
CAN I JOIN?

04:15.389 --> 04:16.924

04:16.957 --> 04:18.459
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

A STRAIGHT SODA

04:31.672 --> 04:34.775

04:40.080 --> 04:41.782
WHY COULDN'T SHE BE
A PART OF THIS?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.584
- BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT QUEERS
DEFENDING THEMSELVES.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.918
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.387

BUT YOU CAN HAVE ONE TOO.
- OF COURSE,

05:26.394 --> 05:27.861
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN THERE
FOR HIM EITHER.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.630
- HEY, DON'T START BLAMING
YOURSELF.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.964
- TED'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS OWN BEHAVIOR.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.733
HE KNOWS THAT.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.835
- STILL, HE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT WE'RE THERE FOR HIM.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.104
- HELL, WE'RE MAKING HIM
COOKIES, AREN'T WE?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.906

WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THESE PARTS?

05:43.611 --> 05:46.113
- JUST CHECKING UP ON MEL.
- HMM.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.448
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S MORE THAN

05:47.481 --> 05:48.882
A BUN IN THE OVEN.
[chuckles]

05:48.916 --> 05:50.451
YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO

05:50.484 --> 05:51.719
CHAIN MYSELF TO THE TREADMILL

05:51.752 --> 05:53.654

05:53.687 --> 05:56.023
MAKE THAT TWO WEEKS.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.534
- THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.469
I'M SURE
HE'LL APPRECIATE KNOWING

06:08.502 --> 06:11.772
HE HAS SUCH GOOD FRIENDS
AS YOU.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.744
- HMM.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.547
- THIS ONE HAS PLENTY

06:28.055 --> 06:30.057
AND PLENTY
OF UNDERGROUND PARKING.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.492

I NEED,

06:31.525 --> 06:34.428
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.163
- BUT IT'S AS NICE AS VANGUARD.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.831
- KINNETIK IS NOT VANGUARD.

06:37.865 --> 06:41.502
WE DON'T THINK IN A BOX.
WE DON'T LIVE IN A BOX.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.504
THEREFORE, WE DON'T WORK
IN A BOX.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.172
EVEN IF THAT BOX WERE
THE SEAGRAM'S BUILDING,

06:45.205 --> 06:48.141
I DON'T WANT IT.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.778
- HEY.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.180
- CHRIST!

06:53.213 --> 06:54.682
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAIR?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.084
- IT'S CALLED A HAIRCUT,
MOTHER.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.986
- I'M--I'M--
I'M--I'M JUST SURPRISED,

06:59.019 --> 07:00.053
THAT'S ALL.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.923
IT USED TO BE SO BEAUTIFUL.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.058
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.727
ANYWAY, WE ALL GOT THEM.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.538
I'M ALSO AWARE
THAT YOU WERE BASHED.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.806

07:20.574 --> 07:22.075
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.577
- DON'T FUCKING TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.613
- HEY, HEY, TAKE IT EASY,
TIMBERLAKE.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.622
[La Boheme playing]

09:48.656 --> 09:50.257
*

09:50.290 --> 09:54.628
* CHE GELIDA MANINA

09:54.662 --> 09:58.966
* SE LA LASCI RISCALDAR

09:58.999 --> 10:03.704
* CERCAR CHE GIOVA?

10:03.737 --> 10:08.809
* AL BUIO NON SI TROVA

10:10.077 --> 10:12.713
- ARE YOU SURE SHE'S ASLEEP?

10:12.746 --> 10:14.982
- SHE'S SAWING ENOUGH WOOD
DOWN THERE

10:15.015 --> 10:17.751
TO KEEP US WARM ALL WINTER.

10:17.785 --> 10:21.254
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
MY FEET ARE FREEZING.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.756
WARM THEM UP, WOULD YOU?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.758
- YOU WARM MINE.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.731
- HEY!

10:30.764 --> 10:34.267
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA WATCH
BY LOVE POSSESSED ON AMC.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.869
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ASLEEP.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.137
- I WAS JUST TAKING A CATNAP,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.072
SO I COULD STAY UP.
[laughs]

10:39.106 --> 10:41.942
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
AND A BLONDE,

10:41.975 --> 10:44.077
EVERYBODY SAID I REMINDED THEM
OF LANA TURNER.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.213
- IT WAS SHELLEY WINTERS.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.881
- IT WAS LANA FUCKING TURNER.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.283
SHE AND I BOTH HAD
THAT PERFECT CHIN.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.885
- AND THE TITS.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.186
- I'VE STILL GOT 'EM.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.155
[laughter]

10:55.188 --> 10:57.758
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
I'D HEAT UP SOME THOSE--

10:57.791 --> 10:59.226
THOSE TURNOVERS,
YOU KNOW, FROM THE FREEZER.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.895
SO WHAT'LL IT BE,
APRICOT OR CHERRY?

11:01.929 --> 11:03.931
[sighs]

11:03.964 --> 11:05.766
- APRICOT.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.301
- RODNEY?

11:08.335 --> 11:09.937
- CHERRY.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.940
- I'LL DRIZZLE EXTRA ICING
ON 'EM.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.711
WELL, YOU COMING?

11:17.745 --> 11:18.946
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, DEBBIE--

11:18.979 --> 11:20.213
- COULD YOU GIVE US
A MINUTE, SIS?

11:20.247 --> 11:23.216
- SURE, HONEY.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:26.286 --> 11:30.824
SAY, YOU WEREN'T GONNA FUCK
OR ANYTHING, WERE YOU?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.159
OH.
[laughs]

11:37.164 --> 11:39.132
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THE TEMPERATURE TONIGHT

11:39.166 --> 11:40.834
IS GONNA HIT RECORD LOWS.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.269
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.471
- 'CAUSE I'M ALREADY FEELING
A CHILL,

11:44.504 --> 11:47.340
AND IT'S COMING
FROM YOUR SIDE OF THE BED.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.376
- SHE NEVER LEAVES US ALONE.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.011
I THOUGHT THAT
WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.980
WE WERE GOING TO BE A COUPLE,
NOT A THREESOME.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.381
- WHAT CAN I DO?
IT'S HER HOUSE.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.083
- IT'S YOUR ROOM.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.851
- WELL, IT'S NOT MUCH BETTER
AT YOUR PLACE,

11:57.885 --> 12:02.289
WITH YOUR THREE ROOMMATES
RUNNING AROUND.

12:02.322 --> 12:07.027
- SO I GUESS
WE CAN NEVER BE ALONE.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.899
- WE'RE ALONE NOW.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.835
- VIC! RODNEY!
IT'S ON!

12:14.868 --> 12:16.403
- [sighs]

12:23.576 --> 12:25.879
- TEDDY.
- MICHAEL.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.247
- I COME BEARING COOKIES.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.782
ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE FROM MEL AND LINZ,

12:28.816 --> 12:30.851
CHOCOLATE CHIPPERS,
BUT GUS AND I WERE

12:30.884 --> 12:31.885
THE OFFICIAL TASTE TESTERS.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.253
- THAT'S NICE.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.387
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CRACK OPEN THE TIN

12:34.421 --> 12:36.189
AND EAT 'EM ALL
IN ONE SITTING?

12:36.223 --> 12:38.391
- WELL, AS MUCH AS I'D
LIKE TO O.D. ON CHOCOLATE--

12:38.425 --> 12:39.459
- FOR A CHANGE.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.062
I MEAN--

12:42.095 --> 12:44.164
- I'M JUST ON MY WAY OUT
TO A MEETING.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.799
- OH, NEW JOB?

12:45.833 --> 12:48.468
- NOT THAT KIND OF MEETING.
IT'S MY 12-STEP.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.905
- OH.
WELL, HOW ABOUT DINNER?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.206
YOU CAN MEET HUNTER.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.441
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH,
MEL AND LINZ TOLD ME...

12:54.474 --> 12:56.043
- YEAH,
HE'S A GREAT KID

12:56.076 --> 12:57.544
WHEN HE'S NOT BEING
A ROYAL PAIN IN THE ASS.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.080
BUT HE'S FUNNY.
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE HIM.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.581
- I'M SURE.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.051
- SO, SAY AROUND 7:00,
OUR PLACE?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.887
- WELL, I'VE GOT MY GROUP
AT REHAB TONIGHT.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.056
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?
OR THE NEXT DAY?

13:09.089 --> 13:12.025
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER,
BETWEEN-MEAL SNACKS,

13:12.059 --> 13:15.562
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.898
- I'M KIND OF BUSY THESE DAYS,

13:17.931 --> 13:19.833
WHAT WITH, YOU KNOW,

13:19.867 --> 13:21.301
MY MEETINGS
AND LOOKING FOR WORK

13:21.334 --> 13:23.570
AND MY THERAPY.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.505
SO--

13:32.612 --> 13:35.515
- TED, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M YOUR FRIEND.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.319
AND I WAS YOUR FRIEND
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED,

13:39.352 --> 13:44.324
AND I'M YOUR FRIEND NOW.

13:44.357 --> 13:48.996
AND I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU
IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.098
NO MATTER WHAT.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.384
- [chuckles]

14:11.418 --> 14:13.020
IS THAT WHAT
THE WELL-DRESSED VIGILANTE

14:13.053 --> 14:14.554
WILL BE WEARING THIS SEASON?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.890
- CODY SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT
WE BE RECOGNIZABLE.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.291
- HMM, WELL,

14:18.325 --> 14:22.129
YOU'LL BE RECOGNIZABLE,
ALL RIGHT.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.964
SO WHAT WEAPON
ARE YOU PACKING?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.398
THE HOWITZER OR BAZOOKA?

14:25.432 --> 14:28.401
- PEPPER SPRAY.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.406
- [exhales]

14:33.440 --> 14:36.143
ARMED AND READY
FOR ACTION.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.980
THIS CODY'S THOUGHT OF
EVERYTHING.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.982
- I REMEMBER WHEN MY MOTHER
USED TO REFER TO YOU

14:42.015 --> 14:45.052
AS "THIS BRIAN."

14:45.085 --> 14:46.519
- WELL, YOUR MOM'S NO FOOL.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.388
SHE KNEW HER LITTLE ANGEL
WAS GETTING HIMSELF

14:48.421 --> 14:50.690
INTO A PECK OF TROUBLE.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.659
SHE'S NOT WRONG THIS TIME.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.527
YOU SHOULD REALLY GO BACK
TO SCHOOL.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.329
- FUCK SCHOOL.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.465
THEY KICKED ME OUT FOR DOING
WHAT WAS RIGHT.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.333
I DON'T NEED THEM
OR THEIR DIPLOMA.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.402
THEY CAN EAT SHIT.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.404
- STILL ANGRY?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.039
- I'M NOT ANGRY,
I'M COMMITTED.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.175
- WHAT, TO SAVING THE WORLD?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.477
- YOU SAVED THE WORLD
FROM AN EVIL POLITICIAN.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.280
- I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE WORLD.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.948
STOCKWELL CLOSED DOWN
THE BACK ROOM,

15:14.982 --> 15:17.417
FORCED US TO FUCK LIKE
BORING BREEDERS,

15:17.450 --> 15:20.153
SO DON'T START MISTAKING ME
FOR ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.089
I JUST DID WHAT I HAD TO DO,
FOR ME.

15:22.122 --> 15:26.559
- AND I'M DOING
WHAT I HAVE TO DO, FOR ME.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.596
[lighter clicks]

15:30.998 --> 15:34.201
[door slides]

15:44.244 --> 15:46.713
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
READING COMIC BOOKS?

15:46.746 --> 15:49.516
- DUH! I'M IN
A FUCKING COMIC BOOK STORE.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.618
- WELL, YOU SHOULD BE
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.188
AND WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.523
HOLY SHIT.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.758
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:58.791 --> 16:02.629
- DID YOU HEAR ME?
I SOUNDED JUST LIKE MY MOTHER.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.531
HERE. READ
AS MANY AS YOU LIKE.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.333
[door opens]

16:06.366 --> 16:09.202
HEY, UNCLE VIC.
- HI, MICHAEL.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.370
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING,
HUNTER?

16:10.403 --> 16:12.072
- MM.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.107
- AS AN OLDER GAY MAN
IN THIS WORLD,

16:14.141 --> 16:15.275
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE INVISIBLE.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.077
- HE'S JUST DOING HIS HOMEWORK.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.545
- I DON'T FUCKING GET ALGEBRA.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.348
- HERE, LET'S SEE.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.651
MAKE "X" EQUAL TO "Y,"
THEN SQUARE IT,

16:24.684 --> 16:26.119
AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR SOLUTION.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.687
- AH, I GET IT.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.656
AWESOME.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.125
- I WAS ALWAYS GOOD
AT NUMBERS.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
ESPECIALLY CUTE ONES.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.030
- YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT
ON UNCLE VIC TO SOLVE A PROBLEM.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.099
- EXCEPT MY OWN.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.301
DO YOU THINK RAGE
COULD HELP ME?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.502
- THERE'S SOMEBODY
YOU WANT BROUGHT BACK

16:42.535 --> 16:43.670
TO LIFE WITH A BLOW-JOB?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.138
- ME.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.140
BUT EVERY TIME RODNEY
AND I TRY TO--

16:47.174 --> 16:48.375
- FUCK?
- THANK YOU.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.643
YOUR MOTHER--
- OH, SAY NO MORE.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.412
- SHE WON'T LEAVE US ALONE.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.414
WE'D LIKE IT TO BE
THE TWO OF US,

16:54.447 --> 16:56.516
BUT INSTEAD, IT'S ALWAYS
THE THREE OF US.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.385
- EASY SOLUTION, DUDE.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.288
SUBTRACT ONE FROM THREE AND
YOU'VE GOT YOUR PROBLEM SOLVED.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.056
- SMART ASS.
- WELL, ODDLY ENOUGH...

17:03.090 --> 17:04.691
THAT WAS RODNEY'S SOLUTION TOO.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.793
BUT DEBBIE AND I'VE LIVED
TOGETHER FOR SO LONG, HELL,

17:06.826 --> 17:09.696
WE'D BE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE IF
WE WEREN'T BROTHER AND SISTER.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.599
BESIDES, IT WOULD BREAK
HER HEART IF I MOVED OUT.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.168
[sighs] AND AFTER
ALL SHE'S DONE FOR ME.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.271
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE
ALIVE IF IT WASN'T FOR HER.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.672
- SHE HELPED YOU
GET YOUR LIFE BACK

17:19.706 --> 17:22.275
SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE
A LIFE.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.811
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THAT,
UNCLE VIC.

17:24.844 --> 17:28.315
I'M SURE SHE WOULD BE
THE FIRST TO SAY SO.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.420
- MMM...

17:33.453 --> 17:37.090
SURPRISINGLY MOIST
FOR LESBIAN-BAKED GOODS.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.159
- [laughs]

17:39.192 --> 17:41.161
YOU KNOW YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE SUCH

17:41.194 --> 17:42.829
GOOD FRIENDS.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.597
- YEAH.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.798
[slurps]

17:47.734 --> 17:50.370
WELL, I GUESS
I'D BETTER FIGURE OUT

17:50.403 --> 17:51.738
HOW I'M GOING
TO SUPPORT MYSELF,

17:51.771 --> 17:57.344
CONSIDERING I'M DOWN
TO MY LAST CRUMB.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.381
[scoffs]
- WHAT?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.515
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

18:02.549 --> 18:04.517
I COULD GET A JOB SINGING?

18:04.551 --> 18:05.885
THOSE PEOPLE
AT THE AUDITION

18:05.918 --> 18:08.588
MUST'VE HAD
A GOOD LAUGH AFTER I LEFT.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.857
AS IF ANYONE WOULD HIRE ME.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.593
- I REMEMBER HEARING YOU
IN THE SHOWER.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.196
YOU SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD.

18:16.229 --> 18:20.333
- EVERYONE SOUNDS GOOD
IN THE SHOWER.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.734
IT'S TIME I PUT
ALL THOSE ROMANTIC NOTIONS

18:21.768 --> 18:26.406
BEHIND ME
AND GET REAL.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.376
[phone rings]

18:33.446 --> 18:35.148
[ringing continues]

18:35.182 --> 18:37.884
- AREN'T YOU GOING
TO ANSWER THAT?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.386
- NO, IT'S PROBABLY
JUST MICHAEL

18:39.419 --> 18:40.887
WANTING TO DO SOMETHING.

18:40.920 --> 18:45.158
- REMEMBER WE TALKED
ABOUT AVOIDANCE IN GROUP?

18:45.192 --> 18:47.394
[ringing continues]

18:54.334 --> 18:56.303
[phone beeps]

18:56.336 --> 18:57.537
- HELLO.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.905
YES?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.508
WHAT?

19:01.541 --> 19:05.178
ARE YOU SURE?
I-I MEAN, YES!

19:05.212 --> 19:07.714
THAT'S GREAT.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.550
THANK YOU.
[phone beeps]

19:10.583 --> 19:12.785
- MICHAEL MUST WANT TO DO
SOMETHING GREAT.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.721
- HE WANTS ME TO SING.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.924
NOT MICHAEL,
I MEAN...

19:17.957 --> 19:19.526
I GOT THE JOB.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.660
- OH, MY GOD.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.828
[laughs]

19:21.861 --> 19:25.265
THAT'S--
- UNBELIEVABLE? INSANE?

19:25.298 --> 19:26.399
A MISTAKE?

19:26.433 --> 19:29.836
- IT'S WONDERFUL!

19:32.439 --> 19:34.541
- SAVE ANY LIVES LAST NIGHT?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.409
- OH, WE HELPED
SOME FUCKED-UP CLUB KIDS

19:36.443 --> 19:37.744
GET BACK TO THEIR APARTMENT,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.679
AN OLD QUEEN CHANGE A FLAT.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.814
OTHER THAN THAT,
IT'S PRETTY QUIET.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.850
- YEAH, WELL, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT BEING A SUPERHERO.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.585
THE AVERAGE PERSON THINKS
IT'S ALL ABOUT

19:45.618 --> 19:47.420
STOPPING TWO PLANETS
FROM COLLIDING

19:47.454 --> 19:50.957
OR SAVING THE UNIVERSE FROM
BEING SWALLOWED BY A BLACK HOLE.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.559
BUT MOST DAYS,
IT'S JUST YOUR AVERAGE

19:52.592 --> 19:54.961
RUN-OF-THE-MILL
GOOD DEEDS.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.763
THIS IS WHERE I GET OFF.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.300
- IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
IN THE DAY, ISN'T IT?

20:35.668 --> 20:39.472
- THIS MORE
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

20:39.506 --> 20:41.007
- I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED

20:41.040 --> 20:43.676
OF HAVING AN OFFICE
WITH A DRAIN IN THE FLOOR.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.545
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.515
COME ON.
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.009
- I MISS THE OLD ORGY ROOM.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.811
- YOU COULD MAKE IT
A CONFERENCE ROOM.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.613
- IT'S PERFECT

21:53.646 --> 21:55.848
FOR SCREWING
THE COMPETITION.

- SOMETHING IN YOUR SPAGHETTI?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.863

WHO THE SINGING WAITER IS?

22:43.896 --> 22:45.498
IT'S--
- SCHMIDT!

MORE BREADSTICKS.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.770

- OH, AND SCHMIDT...

22:50.803 --> 22:52.805
THAT WAS
A VERY NICE PAGLIACCI.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.907
- OH, THANK YOU,
MR. PARDUCCI.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.009
I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO WELL
WITH SCAMPI AND A VALPOLICELLA.

22:57.043 --> 23:01.581
- EXCELLENT CHOICE.

23:01.614 --> 23:02.749
- TED, A SINGING WAITER?

23:02.782 --> 23:03.883
- HE'S SERVING UP ARIAS

23:03.916 --> 23:05.685
AND ARRABBIATA AT RIGOLETTO'S.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.654
- I ALWAYS HEARD THAT PLACE
IS A BLAST.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.822
- OH, HONEY, IT'S LIKE
A GODDAMN RIDE AT DISNEYLAND.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.924
THEY GOT FAKE GRAPES,
FAKE ITALIAN WAITERS,

23:11.958 --> 23:14.761
FAKE SUNSETS PAINTED
ON THE WALLS.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.896
NO FUCKIN' CLASS AT ALL.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.632
- THEN WHAT WERE
VIC AND RODNEY DOING THERE?

23:19.666 --> 23:21.501
- VIC AND RODNEY?

23:21.534 --> 23:22.802
AT RIGOLETTO'S?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.036
- MM.
- LAST NIGHT.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.838
THAT'S HOW WE HEARD
ABOUT TED.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.774
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO
THE GRAND PRICKS LAST NIGHT.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.510
IT'S THAT BIG-DICK CONTEST
AT BABYLON, NOT THE CAR RACE.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.778
- WE KNOW, MA.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.680
- BUT VIC SAID THAT--THAT

23:33.713 --> 23:35.114
RODNEY WASN'T FEELING WELL.

23:35.147 --> 23:38.851
- HI, BOYS.
- HEY, EM.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.687
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
ALL GO THERE FOR DINNER.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.188
- YOU SURE HE'D LIKE THAT?
- WHY NOT?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.123
- GO WHERE?
- RIGOLETTO'S.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.859
- THAT CHEESY JOINT
WITH THE SINGING WAITERS?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.227
WHY WOULD WE WANT
TO GO THERE?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.963
- TED'S ONE
OF THE SINGING WAITERS.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.933
- REALLY?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.536
SO YOU JUST FIGURED
WE'D ALL GO

23:56.569 --> 23:59.539
AND ROOT HIM ON, HUH?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.508
WELL,

24:01.541 --> 24:04.143
BE SURE AND SHOUT
"BRAVO" FOR ME.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.214
- EM, WOULD YOU SLOW DOWN?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.550
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET FOR?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.619
I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW TED
A LITTLE SUPPORT.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.253
- WELL, I'M GETTING A LITTLE
TIRED OF YOUR LITTLE SUPPORT.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.022
COOKIES ARE ONE THING.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.224
NOW YOU'RE HIS CHEERING SECTION?
- HE'S MY FRIEND.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.959
- IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

24:19.992 --> 24:21.694
SO AM I.
- I KNOW THAT.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.130
- THEN YOU MIGHT
TRY CONSIDERING HOW I FEEL.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.633
- WHAT DOES MY FRIENDSHIP
WITH HIM HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.100
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN SAY
THAT TO ME

24:28.134 --> 24:30.570
AFTER WHAT HE PUT ME THROUGH?

24:30.603 --> 24:33.039
- THAT'S BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.841
BESIDES, I CAN'T VERY
WELL TURN MY BACK ON HIM.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.976
- WHY NOT? HE TURNED
HIS BACK ON YOU.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.645
- WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I SHOULD DO THE SAME.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.012
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.848
- "FAIR"?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.783
WHAT ABOUT BEING FAIR TO ME?

24:43.816 --> 24:47.754
WHY SHOULD I BE FAIR TO HIM
OR ANYONE ELSE?

24:51.290 --> 24:52.992
- VIC!

24:53.025 --> 24:56.162
GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE.
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE MOVIE.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.997
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING A SWEATER?
YOU KNOW IT'S CHILLY.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.132
NOW GO BACK UPSTAIRS,
GET YOUR SWEATER.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.834
DID YOU REMEMBER YOUR WALLET?
LAST TIME YOU FORGOT IT.

25:01.868 --> 25:05.271
- SIS, DO YOU MIND
IF WE SKIP THE MOVIE?

25:05.304 --> 25:06.639
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AREN'T YOU FEELING WELL?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.140
- I'M FINE.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.742
I JUST THOUGHT SINCE
IT'S RODNEY'S NIGHT

25:09.776 --> 25:11.744
TO VOLUNTEER AT THE HOSPICE,

25:11.778 --> 25:14.280
YOU AND I COULD SPEND
THE EVENING AT HOME.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.783
JUST THE TWO OF US.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.284
- JUST THE TWO OF US?

25:18.317 --> 25:19.686
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT
IN A LONG TIME.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.155

25:24.190 --> 25:27.193
SIS...

25:29.729 --> 25:30.730
[sighs]

25:37.003 --> 25:39.806
- BABY, WHAT IS IT?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.774
- YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU

25:41.808 --> 25:43.710
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE
IN THE WORLD.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.212
- EXCEPT RODNEY,
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.581
- THEN I HOPE
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT

25:48.615 --> 25:49.982
WE'VE TALKED THINGS OVER

25:50.016 --> 25:55.722
AND WE'VE DECIDED
TO GET OUR OWN PLACE.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.691
IT'S TIME, SIS.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.064
- YOU'RE DAMN
FUCKIN' RIGHT IT'S TIME.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.232

26:06.265 --> 26:07.266

FOR THIS

HAVING YOU HERE.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.805
AND NOT THAT
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT RODNEY,

26:12.839 --> 26:14.674
BUT I NEVER HAVE ANY PRIVACY.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.609
I HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOOR
EVERY TIME I WANT TO GO POTTY,

26:16.643 --> 26:17.844
AND I CAN'T RUN DOWN HERE

26:17.877 --> 26:19.011

IN MY PANTIES.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.280
- YOU DO ANYWAY.
WE'VE SEEN YOU.

26:21.313 --> 26:25.384
- WELL, NOW I CAN DO IT
WITH NOBODY WATCHING.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.219
SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.888

IT'S MAKING YOU SO HAPPY,

26:28.921 --> 26:30.089
I COULD GO RIGHT NOW.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.624

IN THIS FAMILY.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.030
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM
SOME TIME.

- THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND--

32:12.664 --> 32:15.501
- HE'S TRYING TO PUT
HIS LIFE BACK TOGETHER.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.970
AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
THAT HE'S ASHAMED OF.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.039
AND WHEN HE SEES YOU,
HE'S REMINDED OF THEM.

32:20.072 --> 32:23.042
YOU'RE A REFLECTION OF THOSE
THINGS THAT HE WANTS TO FORGET.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.044
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.512

32:55.141 --> 32:57.343

32:57.376 --> 32:59.011
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.346
- TAKE YOUR TIME.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.115
I'M GOING TO PUT THIS
IN THE CAR.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.084
- AREN'T YOU GOING
TO TAKE THE TWINS?

33:05.117 --> 33:06.618
- I THOUGHT I'D LEAVE THEM
FOR YOU.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.487
- BUT I BOUGHT THEM
FOR YOU, REMEMBER?

33:08.520 --> 33:10.222
- OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

33:10.256 --> 33:11.523
- YOU WERE SO SICK
YOU COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.292
SO I PUT ONE ON EITHER SIDE,

33:13.325 --> 33:16.095
TO WATCH OVER YOU.
- AND THEY DID.

TELL YOU WHAT.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.398
I'LL TAKE HER,
YOU KEEP HIM.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.568
THAT WAY,
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.304
- DEAL.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.239
SO, YOU GOT EVERYTHING?

33:27.273 --> 33:30.642
- YEAH.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.179
- WAIT A MINUTE.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.281
DON'T FORGET.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.116
THERE'S A BAKED ZITI, LASAGNA,

33:37.149 --> 33:38.584
A COUPLE OF CHICKENS,
A POUND CAKE.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.819
- JESUS, IT'S ENOUGH
FOR AN ARMY.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.288
- WELL, YOU CAN'T GO
TO A NEW PLACE

33:42.321 --> 33:46.658
WITHOUT FOOD IN YOUR FRIDGE.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.596
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE NEVER COMING BACK.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.698
- I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
THE ONLY WAY

33:52.731 --> 33:56.535
I'D LEAVE HERE WOULD BE
IN A BOX.

33:56.568 --> 34:01.273
- WELL, THANK JESUS, MARY,
AND JOSEPH THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.075
NOW YOU'RE WALKING OUT
THE FRONT DOOR

34:03.109 --> 34:04.543
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND,

34:04.576 --> 34:06.745
AND YOU'RE STARTING
A WHOLE NEW LIFE.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.315
- HMM.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

34:09.348 --> 34:11.150
- WELL, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

34:11.183 --> 34:13.552
I'M ALL SET UP FOR MY
ROSALIND RUSSELL FILM FESTIVAL.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.587

EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD

34:18.624 --> 34:23.362
SO AS SOON AS YOU LEAVE,
THEN MY NEW LIFE BEGINS.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.331
I'M THROWING OFF
ALL MY CLOTHES,

34:32.504 --> 34:34.240

34:40.412 --> 34:41.847
BESIDES, WE ALL KNOW
I'M GONNA BE OVER THERE

34:41.880 --> 34:44.483
BUGGING THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.651

35:19.185 --> 35:21.787

35:21.820 --> 35:23.622
- ON FRIDAY NIGHT
IN THIS NOWHERE BURG,

35:23.655 --> 35:26.258
THAT WOULD EITHER BE
COUNTING YOUR SOCKS

35:26.292 --> 35:27.759
OR GOING TO SYNAGOGUE.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.696
- I'VE GOT PATROL DUTY.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.405
- AS LONG AS YOU'RE WORKING
THE STREETS,

35:39.438 --> 35:43.909
YOU SHOULD TRY MAKING
A FEW BUCKS.

35:43.942 --> 35:47.279
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

35:47.313 --> 35:50.682
- OH. ONE OF THESE JERK-OFFS
FROM THE OTHER DAY PUNCHED ME.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.718
IT'S NOTHING.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.686
- THIS TIME.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.422
- I CAN FUCKING TAKE
CARE OF MYSELF.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.557
- WELL, HOW ABOUT, UM,

35:58.590 --> 36:00.726
TAKING THE NIGHT OFF?

36:00.759 --> 36:02.961
EVEN RAGE AND GOD
GET A DAY OF REST.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.696
- I TOLD YOU,
I HAVE THINGS TO DO.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.833
- MORE LIKE, GOING OUT LOOKING
FOR TROUBLE.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.302
- I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.837
IT COMES LOOKING FOR US.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.839
MOTHERFUCKING
ASSHOLE STRAIGHT GUYS

36:15.341 --> 36:16.842

OUT OF THEIR CAR WINDOW,

36:16.875 --> 36:18.277
AND WE'RE JUST GOING
TO STAND THERE AND TAKE IT

36:18.310 --> 36:19.745
LIKE A BUNCH

36:19.778 --> 36:23.449
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THEY CAN FUCKING DIE.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.551
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU'RE NOT ANGRY.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.219
- WE'RE PROTECTING
INNOCENT PEOPLE,

36:27.253 --> 36:29.221
STANDING UP FOR OURSELVES.

HE'S ALMOST DONE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.984
- I THINK I'LL WAIT
FOR THE MOVIE.

36:59.017 --> 37:02.854
- IS JUSTIN COMING?
- MAYBE.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.856

- JUST FINE.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.640
- YOU WANT TO GET A DRINK?

37:21.673 --> 37:24.343
- NO, THANKS.
RAMON AND I ARE BUSY.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.778
- OKAY.
WELL, MAYBE LATER.

37:26.812 --> 37:29.748
- LATER, RAMON AND I
WILL BE EVEN BUSIER.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.017
BUT, HEY,
WHY DON'T YOU CALL TED?

37:32.050 --> 37:35.821
I'M SURE HE'D LOVE TO GET
A DRINK WITH YOU.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.513
- NOT ANY MORE.
- HOW DARE YOU?

38:01.547 --> 38:02.914
WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU GET OFF?

38:02.948 --> 38:05.951
- SAVE YOUR DIVA ROUTINE
FOR YOUR WORLD TOUR.

38:05.984 --> 38:06.985
WHY'D YOU TREAT MICHAEL

38:07.018 --> 38:08.654
LIKE THAT?
- LIKE WHAT?

38:08.687 --> 38:10.522
- LIKE HE'S
AN INSIGNIFICANT PIECE OF SHIT.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.658
- WHAT THE FUCK BUSINESS
IS IT OF YOURS?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.693
- ANYBODY WHO HURTS MICHAEL
IS THE FUCK MY BUSINESS.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.996
- YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE HE HURT ME TOO.

38:18.029 --> 38:21.433
- BY BEING FRIENDS
WITH THEODORE?

38:21.467 --> 38:24.803
- YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO FORGET HIM,

38:24.836 --> 38:26.405
THAT--THAT HE'S DEAD.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.940

- AND NOW EVERYBODY WANTS
TO GIVE HIM A STANDING OVATION,

38:39.585 --> 38:41.553
JUST LIKE NOTHING
EVER HAPPENED.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.689

38:43.722 --> 38:45.491

38:45.524 --> 38:48.560
- YES, I'M LISTENING.

38:48.594 --> 38:52.364
AND DON'T CALL ME HONEYCUTT.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.434
- MICHAEL IS YOUR FRIEND,
JUST THE SAME AS HE'S TED'S.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.102
BUT IF YOU FORCE HIM
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU,

38:57.135 --> 39:01.573
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE HIM.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.742

A TICONDEROGA NUMBER THREE,

39:09.014 --> 39:10.849

39:10.882 --> 39:12.050
SORRY.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.019
[man shouting]

39:26.064 --> 39:28.133
- THERE'S NOT MUCH HAPPENING
TONIGHT.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.736
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO KICK ASS
EVERY TIME.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.604
- BUT LAST NIGHT--

39:32.638 --> 39:34.773
LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I WAS IN A FIGHT AND WON.

39:34.806 --> 39:37.876
FOR ONCE, THE FUCKING BULLIES
RAN AWAY.

39:37.909 --> 39:41.613

HARDER.

WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT BACK,

39:46.552 --> 39:48.754
THEY MIGHT NOT BE SO QUICK
TO COME LOOKING FOR US.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.889
SO WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO GO LOOKING FOR THEM.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.424

39:52.458 --> 39:54.159
WAS TO PROTECT PEOPLE HERE

TO HAPPEN,

IN JESUS' NAME!

40:08.874 --> 40:10.576
EVERY WEDNESDAY

I'D BE SITTING THERE,
LISTENING TO THE PREACHER

40:12.243 --> 40:15.046
TELLING US HOW ALL HOMOSEXUALS
WERE GOING TO BURN IN HELL.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.915
AND I'D BE SHITTING
IN MY PANTS, THINKING,

40:16.948 --> 40:18.850
WHAT IF
THE CONGREGATION FOUND OUT?

40:18.884 --> 40:21.186
I'D BE KICKED OUT.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.656
MY PARENTS WOULD HATE ME,
THEY'D NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.
