WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:08.880
So I think I'll call this

00:09.049 --> 00:11.165
Woman Pretending Not
to Look Out the Window.

00:11.369 --> 00:16.727
How about Girl About to Pour Hot Tea
On Sister's Head? Let me see.

00:18.449 --> 00:20.917
Either I'm that transparent,
or you're that good.

00:21.129 --> 00:24.201
Well, I don't think I'll comment, since
you do have hot liquid over my head.

00:24.409 --> 00:27.719
I'm sorry, I just...
I was watching Dan come home alone,

00:27.929 --> 00:30.318
and I think a more appropriate title
for that photo would be

00:30.489 --> 00:32.320
Witch With a Severe Case
of the Guilts.

00:32.529 --> 00:35.646
I mean, he was a nice guy
who did nothing wrong and...

00:35.849 --> 00:38.886
Piper, you had to end the relationship,
all right? Your heart wasn't in it.

00:39.089 --> 00:40.681
And it was the only way
not to break his.

00:40.849 --> 00:43.317
I know, I just feel like Dan
got the short end of the stick.

00:44.129 --> 00:47.439
There are so many ways that
I can go with that, but I think I'll just...

00:47.609 --> 00:48.962
Thank you.

00:49.129 --> 00:51.484
Besides, you shouldn't be worried
about your past

00:51.649 --> 00:54.561
when your future is in town tonight
for dinner and a movie.

00:54.769 --> 00:56.043
I know, I know, I know.

00:56.209 --> 00:59.281
My first real date with Leo
as a normal couple.

00:59.449 --> 01:02.566
And normal couples usually shower
before their dates, so I'll see you later.

01:02.969 --> 01:04.527
Okay.

01:05.449 --> 01:07.485
- Hi, doody.
- Hi, doody.

01:07.689 --> 01:09.407
Hey.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.321
Someone's in a good mood.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.599
- What's his name?
- Billy.

01:14.769 --> 01:16.168
- Phoebe, you didn't.
- What?

01:16.329 --> 01:18.206
You went to go see
Kill It Before It Dies

01:18.369 --> 01:19.848
at the revival house, didn't you?

01:20.009 --> 01:21.965
No. Why would you think that l...?

01:22.169 --> 01:25.718
Okay, I did. But you know what?
It was research.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.642
What kind of class
sends you to movies?

01:27.809 --> 01:29.606
No, not for school, for me.

01:29.769 --> 01:31.999
If I'm supposed to figure out
what I want from a guy,

01:32.169 --> 01:34.888
I might as well start with the first guy
I fell for, don't you think?

01:35.049 --> 01:36.960
Billy is the ideal man.

01:37.489 --> 01:39.161
He's a character in a movie.

01:39.369 --> 01:41.724
One that, I might add,
you weren't even supposed to watch.

01:42.209 --> 01:43.244
When I was 12.

01:43.409 --> 01:45.479
I think after a year and a half
of battling monsters,

01:45.649 --> 01:47.526
I can handle a scary movie.

01:47.729 --> 01:49.321
Did I mention Billy
is the perfect man?

01:49.849 --> 01:51.567
Once or twice.

01:53.409 --> 01:55.206
I will get that.

01:59.049 --> 02:01.768
- Can I help you?
- Pheebs, who is it?

02:03.049 --> 02:06.359
- Get up, you miserable witch.
- Hey.

02:06.569 --> 02:08.799
If you don't have anything
nice to say...

02:13.169 --> 02:14.841
And then there were two.

02:17.329 --> 02:18.887
- You okay?
- Oh, sure.

02:19.089 --> 02:20.761
Come on, come on, come on.

02:22.449 --> 02:26.237
All right, who took my loofa?

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.209 --> 02:38.767
Billy? Billy?

02:38.929 --> 02:41.921
I cannot believe
that they made us pay.

02:42.089 --> 02:44.125
Sorry.

02:44.329 --> 02:46.047
He's gotta be hiding
in here somewhere.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.922
Do you think you might keep it down?
This is my favourite part.

02:49.129 --> 02:52.087
Oh, mine too. This is when
Billy comes on, and then they're...

02:52.249 --> 02:53.523
Pheebs, we need a spell.

02:53.689 --> 02:55.088
But we know nothing
about this guy.

02:55.249 --> 02:56.728
I can't just whip one up...

02:56.889 --> 02:58.925
Oh, he's making a break for it.

02:59.089 --> 03:02.126
Evil that has travelled near
I call on you to disappear

03:02.329 --> 03:03.444
Elementals hear my call

03:03.649 --> 03:06.561
Remove this creature
From these walls

03:08.569 --> 03:10.525
That was the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

03:11.049 --> 03:13.165
It's all part of the show, sir.

03:13.369 --> 03:16.486
I cannot believe that that just worked.
It seemed too easy.

03:16.649 --> 03:19.482
Wow, we are getting way too tough
for these guys.

03:25.009 --> 03:26.442
No, no. No.

05:05.489 --> 05:07.559
How am I supposed to know
what his deal is?

05:07.729 --> 05:11.404
He likes moonlit walks,
thinks holding hands is underrated

05:11.569 --> 05:14.208
and enjoys, in his spare time,
killing witches.

05:14.369 --> 05:16.121
It was a question for the room,
Pheebs.

05:16.289 --> 05:19.440
When a demon makes a house call,
my curiosity gets piqued.

05:19.649 --> 05:21.526
Yeah, well,
the house is a mess again.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.442
I mean, how come we can't
fight the demon of cleanliness

05:24.609 --> 05:26.042
or the demon of housekeeping

05:26.209 --> 05:28.006
or even that really big bald guy,
Mr Clean?

05:28.169 --> 05:30.160
I would so totally take him on.

05:30.369 --> 05:31.961
What I don't get
is the order of things.

05:32.129 --> 05:34.484
I mean, don't we usually start
someplace dark and dreary

05:34.689 --> 05:36.839
and then end up at the manor
for the big old vanquish?

05:37.049 --> 05:39.927
Wait a minute.
He followed me home.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.687
I knew I recognized him
from somewhere.

05:41.889 --> 05:44.198
He was at the movies,
and then he followed me home.

05:44.609 --> 05:46.201
Yeah, well, he had a reason
to attack us,

05:46.369 --> 05:48.007
so he would have found us
sooner or later.

05:48.209 --> 05:51.087
But the question is, why? I mean,
we usually don't vanquish someone

05:51.249 --> 05:52.841
without knowing who,
what, where, when...

05:53.329 --> 05:55.923
Well, what about the how? How did
you know how to vanquish him?

05:56.129 --> 05:59.246
Well, remember the spell
that we used for the bunyip?

05:59.449 --> 06:02.282
Well, I just combined that with
the one for the demon with the horn

06:02.449 --> 06:03.768
- coming out of his...
- Forehead?

06:04.569 --> 06:06.799
Nice work.
I wish they all went this smoothly.

06:07.649 --> 06:12.040
- You have one message, 8:23 p.m.
- Oh, my God, I'm late.

06:12.209 --> 06:14.518
I'm so late. I have to get ready.
Here, take this.

06:14.689 --> 06:17.362
- I'll help when I come back, but Leo...
- Go.

06:26.689 --> 06:29.522
- How's the date so far?
- Oh, it just got better.

06:31.449 --> 06:33.440
You can do your homework,
pick the right restaurant,

06:33.609 --> 06:37.807
the perfect wine, waiting and chilled,
but it helps if you show up. I'm sorry.

06:37.969 --> 06:39.288
It's all right, you're here now.

06:42.849 --> 06:45.317
- What?
- Nothing.

06:46.009 --> 06:49.319
It's just this guy,
a warlock or demon or something,

06:49.489 --> 06:52.322
burst into the house, and somehow
Phoebe managed to vanquish him,

06:52.489 --> 06:56.528
but we still don't know who he was.
Something just feels off.

06:56.729 --> 06:58.447
I'm sorry. No work talk, we promised.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.206
It's all right. You're the one who
wanted to keep tonight magic-free.

07:02.369 --> 07:05.202
- I'm okay with it.
- Wanna start over?

07:06.329 --> 07:07.364
Okay.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.522
Pardon me?

07:12.689 --> 07:14.919
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I got the munchies.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.966
- No, not at all.
- And for you.

07:17.569 --> 07:19.241
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:19.449 --> 07:21.519
There's no salt.
Could you ask that table for theirs?

07:21.689 --> 07:25.045
Sure. Excuse me,
may we borrow your salt?

07:26.889 --> 07:28.481
Leo.

07:29.769 --> 07:30.758
Piper.

07:31.849 --> 07:34.727
Hi, Dan and Dan's date.

07:35.369 --> 07:37.041
Amelia, this is Leo and...

07:38.329 --> 07:39.444
And Piper.

07:40.529 --> 07:43.839
Amelia, as in
someone-l-just-work-with Amelia?

07:48.889 --> 07:50.402
Here's your salt.

07:51.729 --> 07:53.640
Thanks.

07:55.769 --> 07:57.999
Well, at least he's not pining away.

07:58.569 --> 08:00.241
No.

08:08.649 --> 08:11.038
Is this some kind of a test?

08:12.849 --> 08:14.567
Okay, so I'd like everything
to be normal,

08:14.729 --> 08:17.402
but there's only so much
a girl can take.

08:17.569 --> 08:19.241
Here's to our first real date.

08:21.329 --> 08:24.207
What are you doing? They need you?

08:24.809 --> 08:26.879
Okay. Well, I guess it would be
the same thing

08:27.049 --> 08:28.528
if I was dating a doctor, right?

08:29.969 --> 08:31.880
I just wanted tonight to be perfect.

08:33.009 --> 08:34.078
Well, it was.

08:36.129 --> 08:37.403
I was with you.

08:40.529 --> 08:42.520
- Wait a minute.
- What's wrong?

08:43.969 --> 08:47.405
If we can't have a normal date,
can we at least have a normal exit?

08:47.609 --> 08:49.804
Enough with
the disappearing guy stuff.

08:49.969 --> 08:52.005
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:03.049 --> 09:04.084
Check!

09:04.289 --> 09:07.520
Talk to anyone who was in
the movie theatre at the time.

09:07.689 --> 09:10.408
Well, find out what happened
before the fight broke out.

09:10.569 --> 09:14.482
No, but I got a location, which is where
you should've been 15 minutes ago.

09:14.649 --> 09:16.924
Are you talking about
the revival house on Larkin?

09:17.089 --> 09:19.478
Not unless you know something
I don't. Do you?

09:19.649 --> 09:22.447
Well, maybe not about this.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.918
Okay, you're gonna be working
with one of our staff writers.

09:25.089 --> 09:27.887
Finley's running late to the interview,
so you have to shoot him before.

09:28.049 --> 09:31.598
Finley? Finley? As in Finley Beck?

09:32.609 --> 09:33.928
Finley Beck?

09:34.089 --> 09:36.887
You know him. And here I thought
you were just a beginner.

09:37.049 --> 09:40.439
Okay, he is the whole reason
why this beginner got started.

09:40.609 --> 09:42.281
He is amazing. Have you met him?

09:42.689 --> 09:44.919
Not in person.
I just know him through his press.

09:45.089 --> 09:48.206
Okay, well, I mean, the prose in this
is mediocre at best.

09:48.409 --> 09:50.445
They didn't even cover
his period in Germany.

09:51.009 --> 09:54.445
Not only is he a gifted photographer,
but he just seems

09:54.609 --> 09:57.362
- so giving and warm.
- A fan?

09:57.529 --> 09:59.679
- Lazy excuses,
and you can tell him I said so.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.838
Yes, Mr Beck.

10:02.129 --> 10:04.006
Can we get started?
I'm on a schedule.

10:05.249 --> 10:08.639
Hi. Mr Beck, I'm Prue Halliwell.

10:08.849 --> 10:11.522
So when is this photographer
blessing us with his presence?

10:11.729 --> 10:13.128
That would be me.

10:14.289 --> 10:16.166
- You're 12.
- Oh, I'm good.

10:16.369 --> 10:17.484
I'll decide that.

10:18.049 --> 10:20.563
Tell me you're not planning
on shooting me in digital.

10:20.769 --> 10:23.522
Oh, no, no, no.
Not now, not tomorrow, not ever.

10:23.729 --> 10:25.720
Digital is for amateurs.

10:25.889 --> 10:27.720
Careful, dear,
your true colours are showing.

10:28.329 --> 10:32.607
Why don't you do something useful
and get me some tea.

10:39.169 --> 10:40.648
Hi, honey, how was school?

10:40.809 --> 10:43.118
Will someone please tell me
what is up with guys?

10:43.489 --> 10:46.287
You don't really expect me
to have an answer for that, do you?

10:46.449 --> 10:50.840
Okay, so I have lunch
with this guy from lab, right?

10:51.009 --> 10:54.160
- He is totally melatonin boy.
- That bad?

10:54.329 --> 10:57.002
I'm keeping his number
in case I have trouble sleeping.

10:57.369 --> 10:58.768
That bad.

10:58.929 --> 11:01.284
So I'm sitting there
trying desperately not to fall asleep,

11:01.449 --> 11:05.920
and all I keep thinking about
was yesterday.

11:06.289 --> 11:09.281
I know, we still have no idea who
he was or how you vanquished him.

11:09.729 --> 11:11.959
No, not that.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.484
Billy. The guy from the movie.

11:14.689 --> 11:16.361
And I know that this is reality,

11:16.529 --> 11:19.043
but why can't a guy like that
exist in my reality?

11:22.489 --> 11:26.687
Here I am talking about the shortage
of perfect men, and in orbs yours.

11:26.849 --> 11:28.407
I found one of the good guys.

11:30.769 --> 11:33.408
Unfortunately,
I'm here to talk about the bad guys.

11:33.729 --> 11:35.685
- No shortage of those.
- Yeah.

11:35.849 --> 11:37.965
They sent for me last night
so I could warn you.

11:38.129 --> 11:40.927
Okay, fill in a blank.
It's the demon of...

11:41.089 --> 11:46.447
Illusion. Apparently he uses magic
somehow to create violence in society.

11:46.609 --> 11:48.918
They told me that he's here
to make San Francisco his treat.

11:49.249 --> 11:53.037
- He's got a scar below his eye.
- And a goatee?

11:54.489 --> 11:56.559
Not a problem,
we vanquished him last night.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.567
Are you sure?

11:59.089 --> 12:02.126
- Because they wouldn't send me...
- Unless the demon isn't gone.

12:03.769 --> 12:06.522
Okay, you call Prue,
I'll go to the Book of Shadows.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.645
We gotta get back
to that revival house.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.484
- Billy? Billy?
- Pardon me.

12:16.729 --> 12:19.846
- Oh, Billy. Billy?
- All right, now what?

12:20.009 --> 12:23.285
Well, when we last saw the demon,
we vanquished him in aisle six.

12:23.449 --> 12:27.283
And now he's in act three,
up on the screen.

12:27.449 --> 12:29.246
Actually, I was just leaving.

12:29.409 --> 12:31.445
I should have known
the disappearing-demon routine

12:31.609 --> 12:32.724
wouldn't fool you for long.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.125
Yeah, all you really did
was piss us off.

12:37.649 --> 12:40.368
- Silly Wiccan, tricks are for kids.
- Piper.

12:41.929 --> 12:45.922
This is the world of illusion,
and you girls are reality.

12:46.129 --> 12:48.768
Your powers, unlike mine,
cannot cross between the two.

12:48.929 --> 12:53.207
Sally Mae? Sally Mae, where are you?
It's getting dark and...

12:55.049 --> 12:57.404
- You said you weren't gonna cause...
- Shut up.

12:57.609 --> 12:58.724
Hey!

13:03.729 --> 13:05.924
Oh, my God.
I think he's looking at me.

13:07.529 --> 13:09.838
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:10.009 --> 13:12.887
Okay, I hate to put a damper
on your little love connection here, sis,

13:13.089 --> 13:15.762
- but we need to kick some ass.
- Oh, is that what you're gonna do?

13:15.969 --> 13:18.403
How cute. How clever of you.

13:18.809 --> 13:20.959
Any idea on how you intend
to do that?

13:21.169 --> 13:25.287
Or are you just gonna flirt me
to death like your little tarty sister?

13:25.489 --> 13:28.367
Watch your language
in front of the ladies.

13:29.169 --> 13:30.238
Consider that a warning.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.885
I'm sorry, was it the word "sister"
that bothered you?

13:33.089 --> 13:36.001
How about "bitch"?
Does that go down easier?

13:40.049 --> 13:41.448
Prue, stop him!

13:47.649 --> 13:50.322
You're off the screen.
How did you...?

13:51.529 --> 13:53.804
Thanks for the inspiration, sport.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.085
So what does he want?

14:06.249 --> 14:09.685
Well, it doesn't matter, right?
Let's just get rid of him.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.807
I don't mean to interrupt,
but is there a point in this scene

14:12.969 --> 14:15.767
where someone explains
my part to me?

14:15.929 --> 14:19.638
Phoebe, you brought the character
back for a play date, you tell him.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.879
You're right, we should've left him
at the theatre.

14:22.049 --> 14:24.005
He would have
really blended in there.

14:25.049 --> 14:27.199
Billy, this isn't a movie.

14:27.409 --> 14:32.244
This is reality,
as in we're all real and you...

14:34.329 --> 14:36.604
I haven't quite figured
that part out yet.

14:37.009 --> 14:41.048
- But you...
- They're the good guys.

14:41.249 --> 14:43.638
Right. Okay, we know
that the demon can go

14:43.809 --> 14:45.845
from the real world
to the world of illusion,

14:46.049 --> 14:47.880
and now he can bring a buddy
along for the ride.

14:48.049 --> 14:49.448
The question is, what does he want?

14:49.729 --> 14:53.438
Leo, they told you that his goal
was to create violence in society?

14:53.649 --> 14:56.482
Yeah, but they left out the how part.

14:57.569 --> 15:00.322
He goes into movies.
That's where he does it.

15:00.729 --> 15:04.563
- Does what?
- Well, first he...

15:04.769 --> 15:08.000
- Where's the music?
- Music? What music?

15:08.209 --> 15:11.042
This is around the second act, right,
when everything's explained?

15:11.529 --> 15:13.485
Where's the music
we're supposed to talk over

15:13.649 --> 15:16.402
to build suspense
and hide the exposition?

15:16.569 --> 15:19.879
- Don't you just hate exposition?
- Don't even get me started.

15:20.089 --> 15:23.479
All right, you said that he does
something in the movie.

15:23.649 --> 15:26.209
- Like what, to the story?
- No, to the audience.

15:26.529 --> 15:30.158
When they leave,
they're different, angry.

15:30.369 --> 15:33.327
So that's his shtick?
He casts a spell in movies?

15:33.529 --> 15:36.839
Must be how this demon spreads
his particular brand of violence.

15:37.049 --> 15:38.448
That's why he looked so familiar.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.679
He wasn't at the movie,
he was in the movie.

15:41.849 --> 15:44.727
So if he can use Billy's movie,
then he can use other movies.

15:44.889 --> 15:47.642
If he's gonna spread violence,
he'll prey on people who are open to it.

15:48.049 --> 15:50.165
All right, so he'll be in horror movies.

15:50.329 --> 15:53.082
I'll grab a paper, head out
to the theatres that are playing those.

15:53.289 --> 15:56.565
- Okay, Leo and I will go with you.
- I'll call Morris, give him a heads-up.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.604
Phoebe, maybe you should
do something with Billy.

16:00.769 --> 16:02.839
You know,
add a little Technicolor to him.

16:09.489 --> 16:10.922
- Hello?
- Miss Halliwell.

16:11.089 --> 16:15.207
- Mr Beck. How did you get...?
- You realize I have photo approval?

16:15.369 --> 16:17.758
Yes, I'm totally aware
that you have photo approval...

16:17.929 --> 16:19.567
- I want to see them.
- Now?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.959
- Yes.
- Well, no. See, actually,

16:22.129 --> 16:25.405
I'm not at home right now,
so maybe we can meet

16:25.569 --> 16:27.924
- at the magazine later...
- That won't work for me.

16:28.089 --> 16:30.808
- Later's not good for you?
- No.

16:30.969 --> 16:33.005
Well, when would
be good for you, exactly?

16:33.169 --> 16:35.046
Now.

16:36.689 --> 16:38.327
What do we do?

16:39.209 --> 16:41.518
Little late, don't you think?

16:41.689 --> 16:44.249
I can see you moving.

16:44.409 --> 16:46.445
Oh, I just...

16:48.849 --> 16:52.159
Darkroom would be where?

16:52.329 --> 16:56.004
- So that's Finley.
- My hero.

16:56.169 --> 16:58.444
Yeah, well, I guess the plans
have sort of changed.

16:58.609 --> 17:01.043
All right, we'll call you later.

17:01.209 --> 17:06.442
Don't mind me, I'm just wandering
through your house.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.087
How'd you like to do that
for real?

17:44.289 --> 17:46.564
- Who is this guy?
- I can get you out of here,

17:46.729 --> 17:49.004
take you to a place
where the movie never ends.

17:51.889 --> 17:52.958
Simmer down.

17:54.129 --> 17:56.927
I'll be back to you in a moment.

17:59.809 --> 18:03.085
So. Interested?

18:04.089 --> 18:06.922
As with most things,
there is one catch.

18:07.089 --> 18:09.683
I get to pick three victims.

18:09.849 --> 18:12.647
They're choice little morsels,
and I think you'll find them

18:12.809 --> 18:15.004
quite powerless
against your charms.

18:15.169 --> 18:17.729
Feel free to kill anyone you like
along the way.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.449
Just get me those girls.

18:26.329 --> 18:31.483
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's make your PG lives rated R.

18:32.329 --> 18:35.446
Who needs violence
when you can make it yourself?

18:36.929 --> 18:39.079
Don't say that to me.

18:40.009 --> 18:41.727
- Hello?
- Hey, this isn't your living room.

18:41.929 --> 18:43.157
You want a piece of me?

18:49.729 --> 18:53.517
And then that part when Sally Mae
gets her hair caught in the car door

18:53.689 --> 18:57.728
right when the monster's
about to get her? I love that part.

18:57.889 --> 19:04.044
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, not only
have you seen it, you've lived it.

19:04.249 --> 19:06.285
It's all right.
I like to hear what you think.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.879
Okay, now, you have to be careful
not to say that,

19:09.049 --> 19:11.279
because every girl will know
that you're not for real.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.249
You make me feel like a kid again.

19:21.849 --> 19:24.682
I mean, I must've seen you...

19:25.089 --> 19:29.844
Well, the movie a thousand times.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.287
I'm glad you liked it.

19:32.769 --> 19:34.919
Yeah, and even with that
ridiculous dialogue

19:35.089 --> 19:38.161
and that predictable story, you just...

19:38.369 --> 19:43.079
You made your character
seem really real, you know?

19:43.289 --> 19:45.245
Phoebe, I am those lines.

19:46.969 --> 19:50.279
That's how I was written.
I don't exist outside that movie.

19:51.329 --> 19:52.842
Until now.

19:55.249 --> 19:56.762
You know, I never minded.

19:56.969 --> 20:00.723
I always knew what scenes
to show up for and what to say.

20:01.169 --> 20:06.846
But then he comes into the movie,
and I'm getting to write my own lines,

20:07.009 --> 20:08.442
be more like you.

20:11.969 --> 20:14.005
I think you're swell, Phoebe.

20:16.609 --> 20:18.361
Thank you, Billy.

20:19.289 --> 20:21.484
But I don't know how this happened.

20:21.649 --> 20:23.560
Or how I'm supposed to be.

20:24.169 --> 20:26.637
Everything I've ever known...

20:27.209 --> 20:29.086
...understood...

20:30.369 --> 20:31.927
...touched...

20:32.289 --> 20:34.280
...it's all been scripted.

20:34.769 --> 20:37.681
I had no choice,
but here you have options.

20:37.889 --> 20:40.357
Where to go, what to say.

20:40.849 --> 20:42.521
What to do.

20:44.769 --> 20:48.603
Well, you're in my world now.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.646
What do you wanna do?

21:18.529 --> 21:20.406
I almost forgot.

21:34.809 --> 21:36.447
- Hello.
- Hi, Phoebe.

21:36.649 --> 21:38.765
Thanks for the heads-up
on the movie theatre thing.

21:38.969 --> 21:41.358
- What happened?
- Mission multiplex.

21:41.729 --> 21:45.244
One dead, four injured,
six in custody.

21:45.609 --> 21:47.122
You believe that?

21:47.649 --> 21:52.120
You know what? At this point,
I think I would believe anything.

21:52.289 --> 21:55.247
Okay, thank you for calling,
but keep your eyes open.

21:55.449 --> 21:58.327
I think this day's gonna get worse
before it gets better, okay?

21:58.569 --> 22:00.366
- Okay, bye.
- All right, bye.

22:04.569 --> 22:07.481
Piper, we found our demon.

22:13.809 --> 22:16.369
You know, maybe you'd like
to take those home.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.685
Relax, ponder,
choose which one you'd like.

22:19.449 --> 22:23.158
Maybe you'd like to be quiet
while I see if I can save these things.

22:24.649 --> 22:28.039
- Prue, is it okay to come down?
- Not really a good time.

22:28.209 --> 22:32.919
Okay, well, I really need
to demon-strate something for you.

22:33.089 --> 22:34.602
Okay, what is it?

22:34.769 --> 22:36.839
Once you finish your thing
and I finish my thing,

22:37.009 --> 22:39.125
then we really need to
go meet Piper and Leo

22:39.329 --> 22:41.797
- to fix the thing that we saw at the...
- Thing.

22:42.009 --> 22:46.161
- Exac... I love you. I'll be back upstairs.
- Okay.

22:48.129 --> 22:49.847
Sisters.

22:51.129 --> 22:53.085
Here, print this one again.

22:53.249 --> 22:55.524
But you need to flag a gradual fade
on the wall behind me

22:55.689 --> 22:57.088
and burn in the key under my chin.

22:58.209 --> 22:59.961
Would you like me
to hold your hand this time?

23:06.609 --> 23:10.363
I figured out what's wrong
with your photos, Miss Halliwell.

23:10.529 --> 23:12.247
Absolutely no depth.

23:13.089 --> 23:14.522
Really?

23:14.689 --> 23:18.284
Now, would that be the technique
or the subject?

23:19.769 --> 23:22.647
- Excuse me?
- I wish I could.

23:23.489 --> 23:27.402
Your work meant more to me
than you will ever know.

23:27.609 --> 23:29.918
And because of that,
I have carried around this illusion

23:30.129 --> 23:32.882
of what it would mean to me
to meet you and to learn from you,

23:33.049 --> 23:35.961
and how that would make me
appreciate your work even more.

23:36.129 --> 23:38.927
But now it is so hard for me
to even look at your pictures,

23:39.129 --> 23:41.404
because I think of the man
who took them.

23:41.609 --> 23:44.806
And it is devastating to me to realize
that the brilliance of your eye

23:44.969 --> 23:47.881
is completely destroyed
by the ignorance of your mouth.

23:53.009 --> 23:55.398
See, that's the thing
about art, Miss Halliwell.

23:55.609 --> 23:59.284
If you leave your subject
under the light too long, they burn.

24:04.889 --> 24:06.368
Mr Beck.

24:08.449 --> 24:10.519
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:20.969 --> 24:22.448
Wasn't much of a date last night.

24:22.609 --> 24:26.124
You wanna find seats in the back
and make out before demon hunting?

24:36.009 --> 24:39.399
Okay, well, I'm okay, you're okay.
Magic perk.

24:39.609 --> 24:42.681
Didn't you hear the management?
Please refrain from talking.

24:44.449 --> 24:46.838
Oh, well, I guess I'll have to kill you.

24:47.009 --> 24:49.000
Better yet... Mary?

24:49.569 --> 24:51.764
Oh, Bloody Mary?

24:54.449 --> 24:56.917
There's one of the girls
who's been getting in my way.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.768
Don't stab her all in one place.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.205
Okay, that didn't work,
but my legs still do.

25:06.369 --> 25:07.643
Okay, let's go.

25:17.529 --> 25:20.726
I'll be right there, Pheebs.

25:42.529 --> 25:44.121
Phoebe!

25:48.689 --> 25:51.726
- Hello? Privacy.
- Hello? Axe murderer.

26:03.089 --> 26:04.886
Let's go this way.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.679
Oh, that was an antique,
you assho...

26:12.889 --> 26:15.323
He's very, very sensitive
about the language.

26:19.889 --> 26:22.881
Okay, dead woman with a knife
on her way.

26:23.049 --> 26:26.359
Leo stayed behind
to calm down the...

26:26.529 --> 26:28.884
Where is everybody?

26:49.689 --> 26:51.327
Pretty sneaky, sis.

26:53.289 --> 26:55.849
Phoebe, does this guy
look familiar to you?

26:57.889 --> 26:59.208
Yeah, kind of.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.802
When Leo and I
tracked down the demon,

27:00.969 --> 27:04.848
he sent some white, pasty hag
literally off of the screen to kill us.

27:05.009 --> 27:06.567
I think he called her Bloody Mary.

27:06.769 --> 27:08.999
Wait a minute,
this Paul Bunyan with a lobotomy,

27:09.169 --> 27:11.319
he's from Axe Husband.
I saw that last week.

27:11.529 --> 27:14.680
We so have to monitor
your viewing habits.

27:22.729 --> 27:24.799
We can't kill them.
They're not real, they're fiction.

27:24.969 --> 27:27.563
We can't kill something
that doesn't exist.

27:30.889 --> 27:32.322
- Billy!
- I have something in common

27:32.489 --> 27:34.684
with the bad guys. Run!

27:45.009 --> 27:50.083
I'm being stalked by psycho killers
and I hide in the shower?

28:12.529 --> 28:14.042
Okay, okay.

28:15.369 --> 28:17.360
At least they're not
in the bathroom with us.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.997
That's kind of good.

28:20.969 --> 28:22.243
Pretty little girls.

28:31.529 --> 28:33.247
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:33.729 --> 28:35.606
I think I figured out
how to kill these guys.

28:38.089 --> 28:39.204
Phoebe.

28:43.049 --> 28:44.641
- Billy!
- He can't hurt me.

28:45.089 --> 28:49.207
You run!
I'll see if I can hold this one off!

28:54.609 --> 28:56.247
Okay, okay.

28:56.409 --> 28:59.446
Billy said the only thing he knows is
what's written for him in those movies.

28:59.649 --> 29:01.401
Maybe the only way
the psychos know to die

29:01.569 --> 29:04.208
- is how they were killed on-screen.
- How am I supposed to know?

29:04.369 --> 29:07.441
I'm a romantic-comedy girl. Why go to
horror movies when they come to us?

29:07.649 --> 29:09.685
All right, that leaves you, Pheebs.

29:10.889 --> 29:13.881
- Miss me?
- Okay, that's Bloody Mary,

29:14.089 --> 29:17.161
and she was thrown out
of a window.

29:17.329 --> 29:20.685
And that axe guy,
he was electrocuted.

29:20.849 --> 29:21.918
So go tell Billy and...

29:22.089 --> 29:24.557
And see if the slasher will stick
his finger in a socket, sure.

29:25.449 --> 29:27.326
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

29:27.529 --> 29:29.565
- Hi.
- Okay, get her. Get her.

29:29.729 --> 29:33.438
We have got to do something
about that complexion.

29:46.049 --> 29:48.119
- One down...
- And one to go.

29:50.169 --> 29:51.887
- Prue.
- Hi.

29:52.049 --> 29:55.325
He wasn't real receptive to the plan.

29:55.529 --> 30:00.762
Does anybody else get tired
of cleaning up after these guys?

30:01.569 --> 30:03.685
Okay.

30:03.849 --> 30:05.248
Hi. Hi.

30:07.569 --> 30:09.366
Take it.

30:14.649 --> 30:17.846
It's okay, the man is here
to save the day.

30:18.449 --> 30:22.965
Billy, it's the 21 st century.
It's the woman's job to save the day.

30:36.769 --> 30:39.806
- It's over.
- Don't ever say that.

30:40.049 --> 30:42.802
Every time someone says that
in the movie, something always...

30:59.049 --> 31:01.119
It's Darryl.

31:06.729 --> 31:12.201
Hi. Serious face. It's okay, we're
too tired for pleasantries. Just tell us.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.006
He's okay.

31:21.209 --> 31:23.006
It wasn't just an outbreak
at one theatre.

31:23.169 --> 31:25.558
I got stuff going down
at multiple locations.

31:25.769 --> 31:29.284
And on top of that, I got a series
of murders straight out of the movies.

31:31.009 --> 31:34.888
- I think we're looking at a copycat.
- Only there's more than one cat.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.045
- How much do you want?
- Only what I need.

31:41.169 --> 31:43.399
It's not someone imitating
what happens on the screen,

31:43.569 --> 31:46.083
it's someone from the screen
doing what comes naturally.

31:46.289 --> 31:48.928
Killing without scripts. So we...

31:51.329 --> 31:53.365
Well, let's just say
we rewrote them.

31:54.649 --> 31:57.243
- So is it over?
- Not even close.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.007
We don't know how many
are out there,

31:59.209 --> 32:00.801
and we have no way
of stopping the demon

32:00.969 --> 32:02.687
from tampering
with the audiences, so...

32:03.289 --> 32:05.405
- You used the D word again.
- Sorry.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.607
Damn.

32:08.769 --> 32:12.079
Look, I gotta get back to the station.
Call me.

32:12.249 --> 32:13.443
Thanks, Darryl.

32:15.089 --> 32:17.319
We have to find this guy
before it gets any worse.

32:17.489 --> 32:19.127
Yeah, only we don't know
where he is.

32:19.329 --> 32:21.126
I know where he's gonna be tonight.

32:21.569 --> 32:23.321
Don't you just love it
when he does that?

32:23.489 --> 32:26.287
The demon didn't just show up at my
movie today. He's been there before.

32:26.449 --> 32:28.644
Every time we leave for a new city,
he goes there too.

32:28.849 --> 32:30.840
You mean he's travelling in the print?

32:31.049 --> 32:34.280
And tonight's the last night in this city.
That's where he's gonna be.

32:34.449 --> 32:37.680
Right, so the midnight show
will be his final performance.

32:37.889 --> 32:41.723
We can't kill him in our world,
so we'll have to do it in his.

32:41.889 --> 32:45.677
You mean go into the movie?
Can we even write a spell for that?

32:46.329 --> 32:48.445
I could probably whip up a potion
or something.

32:48.649 --> 32:50.640
Well, how about two?
One to make sure we can get in,

32:50.809 --> 32:52.606
and one to make sure
we can get out.

32:52.769 --> 32:54.487
Phoebe's pharmaceuticals.

32:57.449 --> 33:00.282
That means I'm gonna have
to leave you there.

33:00.449 --> 33:02.724
So? You'll always know
where to find me.

33:05.249 --> 33:07.604
So let's go to the movies.

33:10.769 --> 33:15.160
Billy, you're back. Just in time.

33:15.609 --> 33:17.440
This is the part
where we're supposed to be...

33:19.929 --> 33:21.885
You brought company.

33:22.449 --> 33:26.328
Oh, Billy, how could you?
We were going steady.

33:26.769 --> 33:29.522
And you... You pinned me!

33:30.769 --> 33:33.488
That's because the writers told me to,
Sally Mae.

33:33.649 --> 33:36.925
I mean, you're a nice girl
and all, but...

33:37.089 --> 33:40.286
Anyway, these people,
they're here to help us.

33:40.489 --> 33:42.719
Phoebe, do you have the potion?

33:44.169 --> 33:46.683
Oh, couldn't you at least have made it
look like it tasted good?

34:05.369 --> 34:07.439
Check me out, I'm retro.

34:12.168 --> 34:13.681
It tastes like ass...

34:14.929 --> 34:16.408
...phalt.

34:17.728 --> 34:19.047
And now for the violent climax.

34:22.768 --> 34:25.601
- Oh, you need to get a life.
- He's under a spell.

34:26.849 --> 34:28.282
Piper, behind you.

34:31.329 --> 34:33.559
All right, deep down I know
that you're an innocent,

34:33.728 --> 34:34.878
so I can't really kill you.

34:37.768 --> 34:39.282
But I can:

34:40.849 --> 34:41.884
Sleep tight, film boy.

34:45.329 --> 34:49.402
You're out of your league.
In fact, you're out of your world.

34:49.889 --> 34:51.641
Didn't anybody ever tell you
what happens

34:51.809 --> 34:54.880
once the movie ends
if you're still in it? No?

34:55.089 --> 34:58.798
Well, I'd love to explain it to you,
but we're out of time.

35:00.769 --> 35:02.805
- Prue?
- Piper, Phoebe,

35:03.009 --> 35:04.920
get out of there quick.

35:07.409 --> 35:10.606
- Prue, why is it getting dark?
- Prue, what's going on?

35:15.689 --> 35:17.441
Prue, do something.

35:18.969 --> 35:21.881
- Where are you? What can I do?
- Help us.

35:30.089 --> 35:31.568
Okay.

35:36.649 --> 35:38.082
Where the hell is reverse?

35:54.649 --> 35:56.128
Prue?

36:03.249 --> 36:04.318
Are you guys okay?

36:04.529 --> 36:05.678
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:06.209 --> 36:07.437
Get out of there quick.

36:07.649 --> 36:08.638
Okay.

36:14.289 --> 36:17.440
Oh, that's right.
Run away, little witches.

36:17.649 --> 36:20.641
So these are the mighty
Charmed Ones.

36:20.809 --> 36:22.128
Watch me run in fear.

36:22.529 --> 36:24.281
Prue, I don't know
what else we can do.

36:24.489 --> 36:25.842
You're supposed to be
the perky one.

36:26.049 --> 36:28.165
You should really try
and not be so negative.

36:29.969 --> 36:33.359
How does it feel to finally know
someone you can't defeat, huh?

36:33.569 --> 36:34.968
I don't know, you tell me.

36:39.809 --> 36:42.881
You know, if you leave a subject
under the light for too long, it burns.

36:45.169 --> 36:47.239
No!

36:55.689 --> 36:58.044
Thanks for waking me up to warn me
about the film burning.

36:58.209 --> 37:00.882
I could've lost my job.

37:01.049 --> 37:03.722
I guess you learned something
from Finley after all.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.084
Yeah, I guess he did come in handy.

37:06.249 --> 37:09.924
You can love the work,
but not the man.

37:10.089 --> 37:12.444
What if you love them both?

37:16.929 --> 37:19.079
I guess it's only fair.

37:19.289 --> 37:23.282
I got my first glimpse of romance
from watching you on the big screen.

37:23.449 --> 37:25.280
Other girls deserve
that same view.

37:26.169 --> 37:30.447
Thank you for restoring my faith
in the male species.

37:31.489 --> 37:34.367
Now all you have to do is hold out
for one that's three-dimensional.

38:07.409 --> 38:10.401
You've gotta be kidding.
The date was a disaster.

38:10.569 --> 38:12.799
And I had a great time.

38:12.969 --> 38:14.960
I especially liked
the look on your face

38:15.129 --> 38:18.439
when the accordion player
broke out into that song.

38:18.609 --> 38:22.318
- You're making fun of me? Yes.
- No.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.485
It was our first date.
I wanted it to be...

38:26.649 --> 38:28.162
I wanted us to be...

38:28.329 --> 38:30.160
- A normal couple?
- Yes.

38:30.329 --> 38:32.524
Well, you're a witch,
and I'm a whitelighter.

38:32.689 --> 38:35.522
You know, being busy,
being called away

38:35.689 --> 38:39.079
are probably the only normal things
about us.

38:45.729 --> 38:46.844
Hello? Door's open.

38:47.929 --> 38:51.001
- Is anybody...?
- I...

38:53.769 --> 38:57.648
- Never mind.
- Wait. No, Dan, wait.

39:03.969 --> 39:05.687
What's this?

39:06.169 --> 39:08.205
This is yours.

39:08.969 --> 39:12.439
Some of the things that you left
over at my house.

39:12.609 --> 39:16.363
I kept them around because
part of me was hoping that maybe...

39:18.569 --> 39:20.924
Maybe that you'd come back.

39:21.609 --> 39:26.319
And after last night,
I realized that I have to move on too.

39:30.129 --> 39:32.199
Thanks.

39:33.609 --> 39:35.406
Hey...

39:35.569 --> 39:39.687
- Dan. Hi. Are you...?
- Just leaving.

39:41.249 --> 39:42.921
I...

39:45.489 --> 39:47.286
Yeah.

39:52.289 --> 39:53.802
Does it never get any easier?

39:55.449 --> 39:58.407
Okay, talk to me of something else,
like what happened at the magazine?

39:58.609 --> 40:02.318
I had another run-in with Finley.
Hey, you.

40:02.489 --> 40:03.808
Anyway, it all worked out.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.039
Did you get to tell off
the demon of crankiness again?

40:06.249 --> 40:07.523
No, once was enough.

40:07.689 --> 40:12.126
But, oh, my editor did love
the shot that I chose of him.

40:12.329 --> 40:15.719
Said that it was the first picture
that captured the real man.

40:15.889 --> 40:19.484
Speaking of, I will never see
another horror movie again.

40:19.689 --> 40:22.123
But I ran across this and thought:

40:22.969 --> 40:28.919
Prue. Oh, Prue. I love it. I love it.
I'm gonna go watch it right now.

40:29.649 --> 40:32.402
Should we worry?

40:32.929 --> 40:36.001
I think she's just saying goodbye.

40:39.329 --> 40:43.288
- Is it really over?
- Yes, Sally Mae, it is.

40:43.449 --> 40:46.885
- Really and truly?
- I'm here now.

40:47.049 --> 40:51.327
And as long as I'm with you,
everything's gonna be A-okay.

40:51.489 --> 40:53.957
- Promise?
- Promise.

40:54.169 --> 40:56.285
You're my hero, Billy.

40:56.449 --> 40:59.566
And I think you're swell, Sally Mae.
