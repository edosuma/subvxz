00:35.687 --> 00:38.447
Here, that looks like him! Here,
look! Mr. Selfridge!

00:40.007 --> 00:43.527
You've made a lot of money out of -

00:43.567 --> 00:46.167
What were you doing in Germany,
Mr. Selfridge?

00:54.127 --> 00:55.967
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen,

00:56.007 --> 00:58.687
I'll answer all of your questions in
due course.

01:06.207 --> 01:08.207
Welcome back, Mr. Selfridge.

01:08.247 --> 01:12.127
Harry. You're home. Thank God.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.167
Pa!

01:14.207 --> 01:18.127
What's going on out there? What's all
this about a scandal in the press?

01:20.007 --> 01:23.287
Victor's downstairs, Agnes, he's
come to walk you to work.

01:24.407 --> 01:27.127
How did you sleep last night?
Better, thank you.

01:35.847 --> 01:37.847
Morning, Victor.
Morning.

01:38.527 --> 01:40.527
What is the matter?

01:43.367 --> 01:46.007
It's Agnes.
She's being so brave,

01:46.047 --> 01:50.247
but it's a week since that dreadful
telegram and we've heard nothing since.

01:50.287 --> 01:52.287
When they say George is missing...

01:53.807 --> 01:56.087
..well, maybe they mean something
else.

01:57.247 --> 02:01.207
It is a possibility. But surely the army
would know if George had been killed.

02:01.247 --> 02:05.287
War is more chaotic than you think,
it is hard to get information.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.806
Well, if Agnes can remain positive,
then so must we.

02:08.847 --> 02:11.567
Maybe she's right and George is still
alive. Yes.

02:12.247 --> 02:14.247
I believe in these feelings.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.847
Your family...

02:22.847 --> 02:25.247
I always knew, I think, that they
were dead.

02:27.087 --> 02:29.687
But it is only recently that I have
accepted it.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.527
Only since I met you.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.567
You mustn't talk like that.

02:35.967 --> 02:40.087
There is nothing wrong with the way I
feel about you, nothing at all.

03:05.487 --> 03:07.487
Herr Selfridge...

03:07.887 --> 03:12.687
Konnen Sie mir bitte genaue Angaben
geben uber Ihren Aufenhalt in Berlin.

03:12.727 --> 03:16.207
Wo Sie gewohnt. Welcher Arbeit Sie
gemacht haben.

03:17.047 --> 03:18.527
Und wer Sie getroffen haben.

03:18.567 --> 03:20.567
Harry.

03:22.847 --> 03:25.967
Why didn't you tell me you were
going to Germany? I've been...

03:27.247 --> 03:30.887
I've been so worried.
I'm sorry. I had my reasons.

03:31.727 --> 03:33.887
Delphine told me about Mr.
Summertime.

03:33.927 --> 03:36.287
She made no attempt to contact him
for me.

03:36.327 --> 03:39.647
Don't be angry with her. She told me
who Summertime is and what he does.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.687
I went in with open eyes.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.567
Papers.

04:05.447 --> 04:08.527
Harry. Harry, are you all right?

04:11.407 --> 04:13.407
I am now.

04:15.447 --> 04:17.447
I missed you so much.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.647
I should have told you where I was
going.

04:23.687 --> 04:26.167
From now on we'll face everything
together.

04:26.207 --> 04:28.207
No secrets.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.967
No secrets.

04:33.767 --> 04:37.247
Did you see what happened with Irene
the other day? I can't believe it!

04:37.287 --> 04:41.087
And then she actually picked it up
and put it down beside the counter.

04:41.127 --> 04:45.087
A lack of customers should not be
seen as an opportunity to
indulge in idle chit-chat.

04:45.127 --> 04:49.607
Please return to your station, Miss Brown,
immediately. Sorry, Mr. Thackeray.

04:55.127 --> 04:58.447
Yank, go home! Yank, go home!

04:59.407 --> 05:01.407
Shame on you!

05:01.447 --> 05:05.007
It's been like this all week, since
the newspaper article came out.

05:05.047 --> 05:08.567
Should we go round the back?
I'm not sneaking in to my own store.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.767
Selfridge, you traitor!
Please.

05:13.807 --> 05:16.287
Mr. Selfridge.
Miss Hawkins, good morning.

05:16.327 --> 05:19.527
I just want to say I don't believe a
word of these rotten rumours.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.567
Thank you, Miss Hawkins.

05:21.607 --> 05:26.007
If he finds out she's been stepping
out with Mr. Edwards, she's
for the high jump.

05:31.367 --> 05:34.967
Oh, Mr. Selfridge, we've all been so
worried about you. Thank you.

05:40.167 --> 05:42.167
Chief, you're back!

05:52.167 --> 05:55.167
Oh, thank you.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.927
What is it?

06:01.967 --> 06:05.367
The hotel owner says your banker's
draft has come back to him.

06:05.407 --> 06:10.007
Your account's been closed.
How very charming of Loxley. Mm.

06:10.047 --> 06:13.487
Well, don't you worry, I can sell my
jewels.

06:14.167 --> 06:17.127
They're in the bank.
You must be careful.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.167
He'll be looking for you.

06:20.007 --> 06:22.007
I can't hide from him for ever.

06:27.167 --> 06:30.407
No wonder the store's empty.
It's in all the newspapers.

06:30.447 --> 06:33.247
The staff are worried. The sales
figures are down.

06:33.287 --> 06:36.287
Then there was this rumor you were
in Germany on business.

06:36.327 --> 06:38.647
I was in Germany.
But why?

06:38.687 --> 06:42.287
I thought we were closing all our
German suppliers down. We have.

06:42.887 --> 06:46.687
So, if we're not still in business
with them - It was government work.

06:47.127 --> 06:50.047
Oh, I see! They were supposed to
keep it quiet and they didn't.

06:50.087 --> 06:52.527
It was handled badly.
I shouldn't have gone.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.607
If it was for the war effort, Chief,
you should have.

06:55.647 --> 06:58.727
And if I may say, I'm proud of you.
Well, thank you.

06:59.247 --> 07:02.847
But I don't think you should be.
This store depends on my reputation.

07:02.887 --> 07:05.407
I risked everything and for what?

07:06.327 --> 07:09.607
So, how's Harry? Was the German trip
incredibly exciting?

07:09.647 --> 07:12.367
I wouldn't say exciting, exactly.

07:13.407 --> 07:17.087
I'm sorry I couldn't find out more
for you but Bill was totally mum.

07:17.127 --> 07:19.127
Wouldn't tell me anything.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.887
Oh, well, Harry's home now, safe and
sound.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.327
The scandal will blow over.

07:26.367 --> 07:29.887
Why, people have said worse things
about me and I'm still standing.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.607
Yes, but you trade in notoriety,
Harry doesn't.

07:32.647 --> 07:34.607
He's feeling very let down

07:34.647 --> 07:37.127
We must think of something to
bolster him up.

07:37.167 --> 07:41.127
Remind him of what a wonderful and
unique person he is.

07:42.607 --> 07:44.727
And how do you propose to do that?

07:44.767 --> 07:47.247
There's people in town he might like
to meet.

07:47.887 --> 07:51.287
Conjurors, like your husband,
who make dreams come true.

07:51.327 --> 07:53.327
What on earth are you talking about?

07:53.367 --> 07:55.487
I think Harry needs a little
stardust.

07:55.967 --> 07:59.367
Delphine, this really is not your
problem. Rose, darling...

07:59.407 --> 08:01.407
your problems are my problems.

08:02.727 --> 08:04.727
That's what friends are for.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.767
Leave it with me.

08:15.567 --> 08:17.567
Sir, there's a gentleman to see you.

08:33.287 --> 08:35.287
Thank you.

08:35.327 --> 08:39.246
One of the manufacturers you wanted
me to meet with, Herr Voss - Ah, yes.

08:39.287 --> 08:42.486
All of his factories along the Rhine
have been requisitioned.

08:42.527 --> 08:45.367
He's sore about it, very anti the
Kaiser.

08:46.047 --> 08:50.447
I told him the British government
wanted him to work for them,

08:50.487 --> 08:52.487
gathering information.

08:53.207 --> 08:54.567
And?

08:54.607 --> 08:57.127
He's waiting for your fellows to
contact him.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.767
That's good news. He could be very
useful to us.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.567
Thank you.
That's it?

09:04.247 --> 09:06.727
What else is there to discuss?
We had a deal.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.447
That this trip would go unnoticed.
Ah, yes, sorry about that.

09:10.847 --> 09:13.767
The British press are a canny bunch.

09:13.807 --> 09:16.327
There also wasn't supposed to be any
trouble.

09:17.167 --> 09:20.567
I was questioned in my hotel room
for hours. I didn't think I'd get out.

09:20.607 --> 09:22.607
But you did.

09:22.647 --> 09:24.647
The point is, you owe me.

09:25.487 --> 09:28.007
There are Selfridge's men fighting in
France

09:28.047 --> 09:32.407
with shoddy boots on their feet and
the blame has been laid at my door.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.447
I want to know why.

09:34.927 --> 09:38.007
You want me to look into the
Procurement Committee? Yes.

09:38.047 --> 09:42.727
I can't do that. I am sure that Lord
Loxley has something to do with this.

09:43.887 --> 09:47.927
It's not in my remit.
I'm sorry, Mr. Selfridge...

09:49.127 --> 09:52.007
but this is your fight, not mine.

10:16.921 --> 10:18.921
Hm.

10:31.275 --> 10:33.275
Good evening, everybody.

10:34.075 --> 10:36.075
I want to say a few words.

10:36.115 --> 10:39.235
Now, unfortunately, I was out of the
country

10:39.275 --> 10:42.275
when this unpleasant article was
printed.

10:42.315 --> 10:44.315
Is it true, Mr. Selfridge?

10:44.995 --> 10:48.635
Well, of course it isn't. It's all
right for you to talk about it

10:48.675 --> 10:50.675
but it's our boys out there.

10:50.715 --> 10:53.515
My brother, my fiancÃ©e, and the
thought of them

10:53.555 --> 10:55.755
with boots which let in the mud...

10:55.795 --> 10:57.795
I understand how upsetting this is,

10:58.395 --> 11:01.835
and I am as horrified as you are,
but you have to believe me.

11:02.555 --> 11:04.795
This is a gross untruth.

11:05.315 --> 11:07.275
Not only is it a pack of lies,

11:07.315 --> 11:11.075
but it was written by a journalist
who used to be welcome in this store.

11:17.555 --> 11:19.315
Now, I have written a letter

11:19.355 --> 11:21.875
that I'm sending off to the paper in
question.

11:22.435 --> 11:26.715
'I, Harry Selfridge, did not and
would never recommend poor manufacturers.

11:26.755 --> 11:29.795
Selfridge's prides itself on quality.

11:29.835 --> 11:34.955
It does not let down its customers,
as I would not let down this country.

11:35.515 --> 11:40.115
Questions have to be asked, however,
as to why the Procurement Committee

11:40.155 --> 11:43.915
are blaming me for their poor choice
in manufacturer.'

11:45.075 --> 11:49.155
Trust me, I will get to the bottom of
this.

11:50.355 --> 11:55.115
There are employees from this store
out there fighting

11:55.155 --> 11:58.275
and I owe it to them to clear this
up.

11:59.395 --> 12:01.315
I have another duty to them,

12:01.355 --> 12:03.955
which is to look after the ones
that they left behind.

12:05.715 --> 12:10.275
We have all heard the very sad news
that some of our Selfridge men...

12:11.155 --> 12:13.155
will not be coming home.

12:14.235 --> 12:18.155
Their families will not be forgotten.

12:21.835 --> 12:23.835
Thank you.

12:44.635 --> 12:46.355
22 men, Chief.

12:47.075 --> 12:49.075
My God.

12:49.715 --> 12:52.715
Next of kin are underlined, the
addresses on the left.

12:53.115 --> 12:55.115
Thank you, Mr. Grove.

13:13.035 --> 13:15.555
Yes?

13:18.315 --> 13:20.315
Oh, Miss Towler, come on in.

13:24.075 --> 13:26.155
I'm very sorry to hear about your
brother.

13:26.195 --> 13:28.915
Oh, George is missing, he's not
dead.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.275
Of course.

13:32.635 --> 13:34.275
You're working late.

13:34.315 --> 13:37.315
Yes, there's lots to do,
now Mr. Leclair's not here.

13:37.355 --> 13:39.355
Ah, Mr. Leclair.

13:40.595 --> 13:42.995
I honestly don't know what to make of
it all.

13:43.035 --> 13:47.155
You know they're holding him
at the American Embassy? Yeah.

13:47.195 --> 13:50.435
Maybe you could telephone and find
out what's happening?

13:50.475 --> 13:53.635
Mr. Leclair isn't high on my list of
priorities right now.

13:54.515 --> 13:56.955
He had the American authorities
chasing after him

13:56.995 --> 13:58.475
and he never told me.

13:58.515 --> 14:03.355
If I could get hold of that woman,
Valerie - Valerie Maurel?

14:03.395 --> 14:05.595
She's in London and he's been
looking for her.

14:05.635 --> 14:08.795
She's at the heart of this, I know
she is, but I...

14:08.835 --> 14:11.115
don't know how to begin to find her.

14:12.275 --> 14:16.875
I know someone who might...
and he owes me a favor.

14:20.515 --> 14:23.635
Jim.
Mr. Selfridge.

14:23.675 --> 14:28.555
Evening, Jim. I'm looking for Mr. Summertime.
His secretary said I could find him here.

14:33.635 --> 14:35.635
Mr. Summertime, a word, please.

14:39.115 --> 14:41.115
Excuse me, ladies.

14:43.915 --> 14:47.195
What is it, Mr. Selfridge?
I need you to do something for me.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.155
Find this woman.

14:55.035 --> 14:57.715
Frank Edwards' paper hasn't printed
my letter.

14:57.755 --> 15:01.035
Perhaps it will be in the evening
edition. It had better be.

15:01.075 --> 15:03.555
The Times has written about you
positively.

15:04.435 --> 15:08.355
That's because I telephoned the
editor to tell him my side of the story.

15:08.395 --> 15:11.275
He's an honorable man.
The rest of them, nothing.

15:12.835 --> 15:16.995
OK, that's good. You can bring that
stuff again to me tomorrow?

15:17.035 --> 15:18.635
Of course.
OK.

15:18.675 --> 15:21.675
I'll personally get it to you by the
morning. Bye-bye.

15:21.715 --> 15:24.835
Sir? Can I have a word?
Yes.

15:24.875 --> 15:28.235
Harry Selfridge, aren't we treating
him rather poorly?

15:28.675 --> 15:30.315
What are you complaining about?

15:30.355 --> 15:32.595
You got your story.
You did rather well out of it.

15:32.635 --> 15:36.355
But the more I think about it, the
more the whole thing smells wrong.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.395
Selfridge is acting out of
character.

15:38.435 --> 15:40.955
He's calling the Procurement
Committee liars,

15:40.995 --> 15:43.355
but he more than anyone was trying
to pal up to them.

15:43.395 --> 15:47.155
He wants to save his own skin. Well,
let's at least print his letter.

15:47.195 --> 15:50.315
No, it's unpatriotic.

15:50.355 --> 15:52.635
Even if there's truth in it?

15:52.675 --> 15:55.195
In war, truth isn't everything.

15:56.475 --> 15:58.515
I disagree.

15:58.555 --> 16:01.435
Do you want to be back where you
started, Mr. Edwards?

16:01.475 --> 16:05.315
I can take away your column as easy
as I gave it to you, remember that.

16:13.955 --> 16:17.355
No yawning on the floor, Miss
Calthorpe. Sorry, Miss Mardle.

16:17.395 --> 16:19.395
It's just ever so slow, isn't it?

16:29.555 --> 16:32.675
Rearrange these cologne scents,
please, Miss Pertwee.

16:32.715 --> 16:36.195
Six inches between each, no more, no
less. Yes, Miss Hawkins.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.115
What's the matter with you today?
Oh, it's just...

16:45.555 --> 16:49.355
I was hoping Mr. Selfridge's letter
would be in the paper this morning

16:49.395 --> 16:51.155
and I could show it to my father.

16:51.195 --> 16:54.315
What's your father got to do with
anything? He wants me to leave.

16:54.355 --> 16:56.635
Says I shouldn't work in a shop like
this.

16:56.675 --> 16:59.675
I don't know what to do, Miss
Hawkins. Well, what do...

17:05.035 --> 17:08.435
Darlings, this is the store I've
been telling you about.

17:08.474 --> 17:12.435
This is Selfridge's.

17:14.515 --> 17:16.515
Let's go shopping!

17:18.755 --> 17:21.395
It's not...?
Oh, my God, it is!

17:22.155 --> 17:24.155
Then there's this, Chief.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.875
The list is growing daily.

17:28.075 --> 17:30.395
Customers who've closed their
accounts.

17:30.915 --> 17:33.995
Mr. Selfridge, you wouldn't believe
who's downstairs!

17:35.155 --> 17:38.195
These are swell. Feel them, Hattie,
so soft.

17:38.235 --> 17:40.995
Darling, they are totally divine.

17:41.035 --> 17:44.835
I'd like five pairs, please, in all
your different colors. Me, too,

17:44.875 --> 17:47.475
and can I try on that cute little
hat? Of course.

17:48.875 --> 17:52.675
Have you heard who's here?
It's Mabel Normand. Mabel who?

17:54.155 --> 17:57.115
Remember, we went to see Mabel At
The Wheel together? Of course!

17:57.155 --> 17:59.155
Look at this!

17:59.555 --> 18:03.755
I just gotta have this darling
parasol.

18:07.475 --> 18:10.035
Mabel, quit showing off.
Make me.

18:19.635 --> 18:21.755
I'm going to try and get her
autograph.

18:22.555 --> 18:23.795
Excuse me.

18:23.835 --> 18:27.115
Don't cramp me, people, or we'll all
fall over in a big heap.

18:27.155 --> 18:30.475
Harry, Harry, this is somebody I
want you to meet. Mack Sennett.

18:30.515 --> 18:33.715
He's the producer and owner of
Keystone Film Studios.

18:33.755 --> 18:37.475
So good to meet you, Mr. Selfridge.
You've been an inspiration to me.

18:37.515 --> 18:40.715
Oh, please. When I set up the
studio, everybody said I was crazy,

18:40.755 --> 18:43.555
a bit like you with your store.
I love your movies.

18:43.595 --> 18:44.955
You do?

18:44.995 --> 18:49.835
What's more important than making
people laugh? That's what I think.
Life can throw bad stuff at you

18:49.875 --> 18:52.675
but walk into a movie theater and
see one of my pictures -

18:52.715 --> 18:55.715
You forget it all. Until you come
out again, of course.

18:57.195 --> 19:00.315
Mack's over here promoting a
full-length feature film.

19:00.355 --> 19:03.435
Nobody's done it in comedy before so
I thought, why not?

19:03.475 --> 19:07.195
Well, I'll be sure to catch it.
I'm having a party the club tomorrow

19:07.235 --> 19:10.755
and we're going to show some of the
Mabel films. Please come, Mr. Selfridge.

19:10.795 --> 19:12.355
I will.

19:14.435 --> 19:16.435
Mabel?

19:17.475 --> 19:19.475
They're going to visit every
department.

19:19.515 --> 19:23.075
It might give the staff a lift. It's
worked already. Thank you, Delphine.

19:23.115 --> 19:25.115
This is just what we all needed.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
All my beautiful jewelery is sold.

19:39.435 --> 19:41.595
Never mind, never mind.

19:41.635 --> 19:45.555
Emeralds don't put food on the table
but this... this does.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.875
Go on, what is it?

19:49.915 --> 19:51.915
Ladyship, it's Lord Loxley.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.475
He's downstairs.

20:07.475 --> 20:09.995
You've wasted a journey. I'm not
coming back.

20:12.755 --> 20:14.755
I want a divorce.

20:14.795 --> 20:17.195
I think we can come to a better
arrangement.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.915
One that doesn't involve scandal.

20:19.955 --> 20:23.635
I don't see what.
Come back and I'll leave you alone.

20:24.035 --> 20:25.955
You can have the house in London.

20:25.995 --> 20:28.875
I'm fully expecting to return to
the country soon,

20:28.915 --> 20:33.075
and live there as I used to.
On what, your dirty money?

20:33.555 --> 20:38.355
Uh-huh. Mae, you always had
imagination.

20:39.515 --> 20:44.595
Now, let me be clear. I don't want
you bandying that story about.

20:45.395 --> 20:47.795
It's in both our interests if you
forget it.

20:49.795 --> 20:52.475
Come back, and we'll forget this
ever happened.

20:53.515 --> 20:55.515
We're good for each other.

20:56.635 --> 20:59.355
I knew that from the first time I
set my eyes on you.

20:59.915 --> 21:01.915
You've always been the woman for me.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.115
I do appreciate that you're being so
reasonable.

21:06.155 --> 21:09.595
I... I just need some time to think.

21:10.355 --> 21:14.755
Don't leave it too long. I can't
keep the gossips at bay for ever.

21:31.715 --> 21:33.715
What does he want?

21:34.395 --> 21:36.395
My silence.

21:37.795 --> 21:39.795
I need to destroy him.

21:40.795 --> 21:42.795
Before he destroys me.

21:44.354 --> 21:47.794
You look very smart today, Florian.
I'm going for a job interview.

21:47.834 --> 21:51.714
For the Music In Wartime Committee?
No, they have enough musicians.

21:51.754 --> 21:55.154
I'm applying to do other war work.
I must help in any way I can.

21:55.194 --> 21:57.674
But the violin -
I appreciate your concern.

21:58.434 --> 22:02.514
But I'm able to make these decisions
for myself. Thank you for breakfast.

22:09.434 --> 22:12.674
Poor Florian. He seemed like he was
really cheering up

22:12.714 --> 22:14.714
and now... sad again.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.634
Has anything happened?
Oh, I have no idea.

22:18.474 --> 22:22.154
Well, if you'll excuse me...
You're going in early this morning.

22:22.994 --> 22:26.074
I am... I'm going to the American
Embassy.

22:26.114 --> 22:30.034
I've written to Mr. Leclair. I
thought he should know

22:30.074 --> 22:32.354
that Mr. Selfridge hasn't given up on
him.

22:33.554 --> 22:36.234
That's kind of you.
It's not a personal letter.

22:36.274 --> 22:39.274
It's erm... There's nothing
inappropriate about it.

22:39.314 --> 22:42.234
Of course there isn't. Mr. Leclair is
your colleague.

22:42.954 --> 22:44.634
You're worried for him.

22:44.674 --> 22:47.834
Just don't know how he could have
got himself into this position.

22:47.874 --> 22:50.314
You said he was looking for a young
lady.

22:50.354 --> 22:52.034
Yes

22:52.074 --> 22:55.994
Maybe he allowed his emotions
to... overcome him.

22:57.954 --> 22:59.954
He followed his heart.

23:02.194 --> 23:04.194
I don't know what it's about.

23:04.234 --> 23:06.234
Anyway, it serves him right if he...

23:08.354 --> 23:10.354
Are you all right, my dear?

23:10.394 --> 23:12.394
Of course I am.

23:13.514 --> 23:16.274
Agnes. Your letter.

23:20.914 --> 23:23.394
Ah, Mr. Leclair.

23:23.434 --> 23:27.514
This is Mr. Regan of the New York
District Attorney's Office.

23:27.554 --> 23:32.674
As you know, nine months ago, a
considerable sum of money

23:32.714 --> 23:37.034
was embezzled from J Walter Thompson
whilst you were employed by the company.

23:37.714 --> 23:40.714
I did not take this money.
Why did you skip the country

23:40.754 --> 23:43.554
before we could even question you?
I panicked.

23:44.514 --> 23:46.634
I thought you were coming to arrest
me.

23:46.674 --> 23:48.674
You skipped because you're guilty.

23:48.714 --> 23:51.114
Now, I'm going to get you back to
America...

23:51.954 --> 23:53.954
and lock you up for a long time.

23:55.954 --> 23:57.954
You understand, Mr. Leclair?

23:59.674 --> 24:01.674
Your luck ran out.

24:02.154 --> 24:06.074
I'm looking forward to this party
tonight. Mabel Normand is terrific.

24:06.114 --> 24:09.714
I might cry off. Come, they're a
good bunch, they'll cheer you up.

24:09.754 --> 24:12.474
I'm just a little tired.
It's been a long week.

24:12.514 --> 24:16.794
You can say that again. Frank Edwards'
paper still hasn't printed my letter.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.554
I'll have to get the lawyers onto it,

24:18.594 --> 24:21.154
although it'll take forever to go
through the courts

24:21.194 --> 24:22.914
and the damage is done, God damn it.

24:22.954 --> 24:27.274
Lady Loxley is here. She's asking to
speak to Mr. Selfridge.

24:35.154 --> 24:37.154
Ah!

24:37.194 --> 24:39.314
Harry, how are you?

24:42.114 --> 24:45.274
I'm so sorry about this. What can I
do for you? I'm rather busy.

24:45.314 --> 24:48.514
I know you must be angry but please
believe me when I say

24:48.554 --> 24:50.794
I had no choice but to vouch for
Loxley.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.754
If we can put aside our differences,
together we may be able

24:54.794 --> 24:57.234
to prove that my husband is behind
this scandal.

24:57.274 --> 24:59.274
I don't see why you'd want to do
that.

25:01.354 --> 25:03.354
Loxley and I are...

25:03.394 --> 25:06.794
We're not getting on and it would
help me to see him disgraced.

25:08.554 --> 25:10.754
It's always the same with you, isn't
it?

25:11.474 --> 25:13.834
You use a situation for your own
gain.

25:13.874 --> 25:16.994
The 'situation', as you call is, is
very complicated.

25:17.034 --> 25:20.234
Complicated, how? Rose and I thought
you were our friend.

25:20.274 --> 25:25.634
I am your friend, that's why I'm
here! You need me. I don't see why.

25:25.674 --> 25:29.754
Harry, the Procurement Committee,
they've questioned your integrity.

25:29.794 --> 25:33.314
Now, some of the most important
people in the land sit on that committee.

25:33.354 --> 25:36.154
whereas you...
Yes?

25:36.714 --> 25:38.714
What about me?

25:40.354 --> 25:44.714
At the end of the day, you run a
store. Now, in their minds,

25:44.754 --> 25:47.034
that means you are surplus to
requirement.

25:47.074 --> 25:50.154
But I know things about Loxley -
Please leave my house.

26:07.954 --> 26:11.874
Um... There's someone staying here,
a Mr. Leclair.

26:11.914 --> 26:13.914
Please could you see he gets this?

26:41.474 --> 26:44.274
Daisy, Charlie, with me.

26:44.314 --> 26:46.194
Aren't they beautiful?

26:46.234 --> 26:49.634
Not surprising, they're Mack
Sennett's Bathing Beauties.

26:49.674 --> 26:54.674
That's the first time I've seen you smile
in a long time. Tonight I intend
to enjoy myself.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.714
Roll it!

27:56.714 --> 27:58.714
Bravo!

28:00.874 --> 28:02.874
Bravo!

28:08.874 --> 28:10.874
May I join you?

28:27.234 --> 28:30.074
I want to explain your decision
regarding you and me.

28:30.114 --> 28:32.114
There is nothing to explain.

28:32.874 --> 28:34.714
But there is.

28:34.754 --> 28:38.794
You're right. I have been running
away from my feelings for you.

28:42.234 --> 28:45.154
A while ago I was in a relationship
with a gentleman.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.794
He hurt me.

28:50.114 --> 28:52.514
I don't ever want to be hurt like
that again.

28:55.514 --> 28:57.834
He also made me feel I didn't
deserve to be loved.

28:57.874 --> 28:59.794
Who is this man?
That doesn't matter.

28:59.834 --> 29:01.834
And how could he have been so wrong?

29:02.234 --> 29:06.074
You, of all people, deserve to be
loved.

29:23.394 --> 29:25.394
Excuse me!

29:26.394 --> 29:30.274
Hi! Tom Collins. Two, please.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.274
Would you like to be a movie star?

29:38.554 --> 29:42.154
Gosh! Well... I'd love that.

29:42.194 --> 29:44.194
I mean, I'd like to try, anyway.

29:44.234 --> 29:47.674
I direct my own movies. I can make
it happen.

29:48.514 --> 29:50.514
Let's drink to it.

29:52.114 --> 29:54.114
What is it?
A Tom Collins.

29:54.154 --> 29:56.154
Don't say you never had one!

29:57.474 --> 30:00.714
Well, I -
Go on! It won't bite ya.

30:07.914 --> 30:10.274
Well, I'm not going to beat around
the bush.

30:10.314 --> 30:12.394
I'm looking to set up another
studio.

30:12.434 --> 30:16.314
There's acres of land out there to
build on. I need a business partner.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.474
Well, if you're asking -
That's exactly what I'm doing.

30:21.434 --> 30:23.754
At least pay a visit and see what
it's like.

30:23.794 --> 30:25.794
You know, I just might do that.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.914
What are you two plotting?

30:27.954 --> 30:30.834
I'm trying to get Mr. Selfridge over
to California.

30:30.874 --> 30:33.954
Harry doesn't need California, he's
got London, Mack.

30:33.994 --> 30:36.474
Well, London doesn't much like me
right now.

30:36.514 --> 30:40.514
But it will. You'll come back from
this. We need you, Harry.

30:40.554 --> 30:42.554
You're our dream-maker.

30:42.594 --> 30:44.594
Mr. Selfridge.

30:45.914 --> 30:47.914
Excuse me.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.154
I've found her. She's at this
address.

30:54.194 --> 30:56.114
I left a couple of my people with
her,

30:56.154 --> 30:58.714
make sure she doesn't take it into
her head to leave.

30:58.754 --> 31:02.074
She's jumpy as a rabbit. Who knows
what you'll get out of her.

31:16.616 --> 31:18.616
Morning!

31:23.135 --> 31:26.655
Good morning, Master Selfridge.
Lovely day, isn't it? Lovely.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.935
Psst!

31:46.455 --> 31:50.095
You look awful.
Thanks,

31:54.422 --> 31:56.422
Thank you.

31:56.862 --> 31:59.782
What's in a Tom Collins, anyway?
Something lethal.

32:00.902 --> 32:04.822
I reckon it's worth the headache.
You splashed out with Mabel Normand.

32:05.582 --> 32:07.822
Do you think you'll see her again?
Hope not.

32:09.342 --> 32:13.542
She was fun but totally over the
top. Better on the screen than off.

32:13.582 --> 32:17.302
You're not about to run off and be a
film star, then? Not on your life.

32:20.062 --> 32:22.742
Give me the tea emporium at
Selfridge's any day.

32:26.902 --> 32:28.102
Good morning.

32:28.142 --> 32:33.222
Good morning, Mr. Crabb. I've called you
together to assess our present situation.

32:33.262 --> 32:35.262
We are down but by no means out.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.742
Last week's figures are up on the
week before.

32:39.502 --> 32:41.582
The American spending spree helped.

32:41.622 --> 32:45.782
But we must remain united and loyal
to Mr. Selfridge.

32:45.822 --> 32:48.342
Well said, Mr. Crabb.
Even if he's never here?

32:49.622 --> 32:51.582
The Chief is out on important
business.

32:51.622 --> 32:53.382
To do with Mr. Leclair, no doubt.

32:53.422 --> 32:55.942
Have you seen this, in Town Talk?

32:56.582 --> 32:59.582
Apparently, Mr. Leclair is to face
charges in America.

32:59.982 --> 33:03.182
Mr. Edwards says there isn't a word
of truth in that column.

33:05.462 --> 33:07.462
THE Mr. Edwards?

33:09.222 --> 33:10.462
Yes.

33:10.502 --> 33:13.022
I had nothing to do with that
article, though.

33:13.062 --> 33:17.062
One of the girls might have to leave
because of the trouble it's caused.

33:17.422 --> 33:19.422
Mr. Edwards is ruining people's
lives.

33:19.462 --> 33:22.222
He certainly is. Perhaps you should
have thought about

33:22.262 --> 33:25.022
what sort of gentleman he was
before consorting with him.

33:25.062 --> 33:29.382
I suggest we put Miss Hawkins' previous
association with Mr. Edwards behind us.

33:29.422 --> 33:31.422
This is not a time to bicker.

33:32.302 --> 33:35.462
Mr. Crabb is right, unity is
everything.

33:45.502 --> 33:48.702
Do you think it's true, about Mr.
Leclair going to America?

33:48.742 --> 33:51.382
If it is, there's not much we can
do.

33:53.142 --> 33:55.182
That man's brought you nothing but
worry.

33:55.222 --> 33:58.342
You're worth a hundred Henri
Leclairs. Forget about it.

33:58.382 --> 34:00.902
You're right. No, I've done
everything I can.

34:19.822 --> 34:22.502
There's no doubt in my mind.
We should keep him?

34:24.902 --> 34:27.982
What are you doing here?
I'm here to get you out, I hope.

34:28.022 --> 34:30.222
I brought an old friend of yours with
me.

34:34.382 --> 34:37.462
Valerie?
Bonjour, Henri.

34:41.141 --> 34:44.342
My husband was Monsieur Leclair's
senior at JW Thompson.

34:45.181 --> 34:47.502
He was jealous of Monsieur Leclair.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.782
Why?
Because...

34:53.702 --> 34:55.702
..Henri and I used to be lovers.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.182
Is that true?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.222
I had the choice of two men...

35:02.062 --> 35:06.582
Henri or Morgan, and Morgan was
influential, high up in the company,

35:06.622 --> 35:08.902
so I chose him.

35:08.942 --> 35:13.102
It was a bad decision, something I
regret very much.

35:13.742 --> 35:17.782
What is this to do with the thousands of
dollars taken from clients' accounts?

35:17.822 --> 35:21.022
I did not take the money.
I've told you this so many times.

35:21.062 --> 35:23.062
Then why did you skip the country?

35:23.102 --> 35:25.182
It's not the action of an innocent
man.

35:25.222 --> 35:28.902
I told him to leave. Morgan said it
was the best thing for Henri to do

35:28.942 --> 35:32.342
and it was only afterwards I
realised

35:32.382 --> 35:34.382
that it made Henri look guilty.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.902
Which was what Morgan wanted.

35:44.862 --> 35:46.862
It was Morgan who took the money.

35:51.262 --> 35:53.262
Can you prove it?

35:54.222 --> 35:56.422
I kept copies of our personal
accounts.

35:57.222 --> 36:01.702
You will see the amounts of money going
in corresponds with the amounts missing.

36:01.742 --> 36:04.102
Miss Maurel, if this is true,

36:04.142 --> 36:06.622
you have done Mr. Leclair a great
disservice.

36:09.662 --> 36:11.662
I'm so sorry.

36:13.142 --> 36:15.862
Ambassador, Henri Leclair is an
honorable man.

36:15.902 --> 36:20.022
I can vouch for him 100%. Now,
if he agrees to not leave England

36:20.062 --> 36:23.822
until this is cleared up, surely you
can let him go.

36:24.262 --> 36:28.222
I'll seek approval for the
extradition order to be rescinded,

36:28.262 --> 36:30.782
but it will have to be approved by a
judge.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.822
In the meantime?

36:32.862 --> 36:36.862
You must keep us informed of your
movements, Mr. Leclair,

36:36.902 --> 36:39.662
and you must on no account leave the
country.

36:39.702 --> 36:42.342
But if you agree to these terms -
I do.

36:43.862 --> 36:46.142
Then you are free to go.

36:47.822 --> 36:52.022
I don't know how to thank you. I'm
so sorry I've involved you in this.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.782
I came to London to find Valerie
because I suspected Morgan,

36:56.822 --> 36:59.142
but then you offered me work and
friendship

36:59.182 --> 37:01.182
and it was too tempting to resist.

37:01.582 --> 37:03.502
It's over now.

37:03.542 --> 37:06.662
It's not over. You're in trouble,
and it's because of me.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.982
No, it's not just because of you.

37:09.582 --> 37:12.982
Listen, when my name is cleared,
I must go to France to fight.

37:13.542 --> 37:16.982
But until then, I'll stay with you.
Together we can make Selfridge's

37:17.022 --> 37:19.542
the most talked about store in
London again.

37:19.582 --> 37:22.222
I needed to hear that.
More than anything.

37:47.862 --> 37:49.862
No.

38:23.102 --> 38:26.622
I wonder what Mr. Selfridge
wants to talk to us about this time?

38:26.662 --> 38:28.382
Not more bad news, I hope.

38:28.422 --> 38:31.222
Thank you for supporting me earlier,
Miss Mardle.

38:31.262 --> 38:34.182
I haven't always been the first to
stand up for people

38:34.222 --> 38:36.222
and I'd like to try to change that.

38:37.502 --> 38:39.502
I'm going to turn over a new leaf.

38:40.462 --> 38:43.462
Oh, well... that will
be... interesting.

38:48.142 --> 38:50.222
Good afternoon, all of you.

38:50.262 --> 38:54.022
We've had a tough week or two and it
can be hard to imagine it will get better.

38:54.062 --> 38:56.862
But all you need is one thing to go
right, and it has.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.902
Monsieur Leclair's returned to us.

39:06.502 --> 39:08.622
I want to say thank you to Mr.
Selfridge.

39:08.662 --> 39:11.542
I would not be standing here now if
it wasn't for him.

39:12.542 --> 39:14.542
I won't forget it.

39:26.382 --> 39:28.382
I-I got your letter.

39:29.222 --> 39:32.742
It made me feel hopeful when I
wasn't sure there was hope left.

39:32.782 --> 39:35.742
I just wanted to make sure that you
knew

39:35.782 --> 39:38.182
that Mr. Selfridge was looking for
Valerie.

39:38.222 --> 39:41.942
Did he find her? Yes,
and she confirmed my innocence,

39:41.982 --> 39:44.262
so thank you.
Oh, it doesn't matter.

39:44.302 --> 39:46.302
It matters.

39:46.862 --> 39:50.502
I've always treated you as an
ingÃ©nue, my protege, I suppose.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.182
I was. I mean, you taught me so
much.

39:53.222 --> 39:56.102
A little, perhaps, but really you
taught yourself.

39:57.742 --> 40:01.982
You've always understood more than
me and seen more than me.

40:03.742 --> 40:08.102
Agnes, I've been such a fool, I -
Please, Henri, don't.

40:11.782 --> 40:14.302
As a friend, I'm glad you're all
right,

40:14.342 --> 40:19.902
and your troubles are over, but...
let's not make of this than it is.

40:21.182 --> 40:24.302
As soon as George comes back,
I'm marrying Mr. Colleano.

40:24.702 --> 40:26.942
He's the right man for me, he always
has been.

40:31.902 --> 40:34.222
Good to have you back, Mr. Leclair.
Thank you.

40:34.262 --> 40:37.582
I was just telling Mr. Leclair about
our engagement, Victor.

40:38.902 --> 40:42.302
The ring is beautiful.
Congratulations.

40:44.502 --> 40:46.502
Excuse me.

40:51.542 --> 40:54.182
To my friends, the Selfridge family.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.342
Cheers, my friend.

40:59.062 --> 41:01.902
Talking about family, Harry. I was
thinking,

41:01.942 --> 41:04.502
why don't we get the girls and your
mother over here?

41:04.542 --> 41:06.622
In times of trouble we should be
together.

41:06.662 --> 41:08.462
I'd love that more than anything.

41:08.502 --> 41:10.702
So would I, I haven't seen the girls
in ages.

41:10.742 --> 41:13.582
That's settled then. I'll send word
to your mother tomorrow.

41:13.622 --> 41:16.222
Mr. Selfridge, a visitor for you.

41:22.902 --> 41:25.782
We're heading back to America at the
end of the week.

41:25.822 --> 41:27.822
A short visit, then.
Afraid so.

41:27.862 --> 41:31.382
Have you thought any more about my
offer? Come and be my partner.

41:32.222 --> 41:34.182
It's very flattering but I can't.

41:34.222 --> 41:36.222
I'm not a movie man, I'm a merchant.

41:36.262 --> 41:39.062
Delphine's right, that's the dream I
make.

41:40.182 --> 41:42.702
Well, she's a smart and savvy
businesswoman.

41:43.782 --> 41:47.382
You're a breath of fresh air, Mr.
Sennett, and if things get too bad

41:47.422 --> 41:50.102
all I need to do is buy a ticket to
the movies. Hah!

41:50.142 --> 41:53.062
Well, best of luck, Mr. Selfridge,
and knock 'em dead.

41:53.102 --> 41:55.742
I have no doubt you will.
Thanks, Mack.

41:59.262 --> 42:01.262
Nice house!

42:09.902 --> 42:13.182
You know, Mack's made me think.
Sometimes the simplest solution

42:13.222 --> 42:15.942
is the one staring you right in the
face.

42:15.982 --> 42:17.982
What do you mean?

42:19.262 --> 42:21.262
I need to get the store back on
track.

42:21.302 --> 42:25.102
Remind people what Selfridge's is all
about. Oh, yeah, what's that?

42:25.982 --> 42:27.982
Forgetting about your problems.

42:29.302 --> 42:31.302
Escape. Dreams.

42:32.502 --> 42:35.462
You know, Delphine's one hell of a
woman.

42:35.502 --> 42:37.502
She and I really see eye to eye.

42:38.582 --> 42:40.782
You do?
Yeah.

42:40.822 --> 42:44.342
I think she might be able to help me
get the store out of this mess.

42:45.222 --> 42:47.982
Thank you for bringing her into our
lives.
