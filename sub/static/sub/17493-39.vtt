QUACK

00:04.720 --> 00:07.440
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK

00:07.440 --> 00:11.320
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK

00:11.320 --> 00:13.040
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK #

00:15.560 --> 00:19.280
It's a snowy day and Sarah
and Duck are heading to the park.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.840
Good walk you've got there. Crab
walk.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.920
Ah! Yes.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.920
Snow crabs. He-he.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.760
QUACK!

00:29.400 --> 00:31.360
Wow!

00:31.360 --> 00:33.400
A winter fair!

00:33.400 --> 00:34.960
Shall we go in?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.160
Uh-huh!

00:43.840 --> 00:46.400
Toasty cosy!

00:54.960 --> 00:56.560
Ooh!

00:56.560 --> 00:57.640
QUACK

00:57.640 --> 00:59.840
Huh!

01:07.160 --> 01:09.360
There we are!

01:09.360 --> 01:11.240
Huh?

01:16.480 --> 01:17.600
Wow!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.280
My word...

01:27.360 --> 01:29.320
It's an ice-skating rink.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.000
How very exciting!

01:33.240 --> 01:34.760
You should have a go.

01:34.760 --> 01:35.800
Yes.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.120
Shoes, please.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.160
Oh!

01:48.160 --> 01:50.080
See you soon!

01:50.080 --> 01:52.040
Eh!

01:55.120 --> 01:56.160
QUACK

02:02.520 --> 02:04.480
QUACK!

02:05.600 --> 02:08.000
Coming, Duck. Ooh! Whoa!

02:08.000 --> 02:11.640
Everything OK?
My legs don't know these shoes.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.000
Whoa!

02:14.040 --> 02:17.640
You probably just need to get
used to them. Uh-huh.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.000
QUACK QUACK!

02:20.000 --> 02:22.880
QUACK QUACK

02:22.880 --> 02:25.160
Hmm.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.800
Come 'ere, you!
QUACK

02:28.440 --> 02:30.160
They're not half bad!

02:31.880 --> 02:33.280
Hmm.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.800
Uh! Oh!

02:37.600 --> 02:39.360
Never mind, Sarah.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.520
Ice skating's not for everyone.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.400
S'pose not...

02:43.400 --> 02:46.880
Isn't that Scarf Lady's bag?

02:46.880 --> 02:49.120
Hmm?

02:49.120 --> 02:51.720
Oh! Hello.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.280
How do?

02:53.280 --> 02:55.760
Not joining Scarf Lady on the ice?

02:55.760 --> 02:58.480
Uh, no. I'm a bag. Not a skater.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.960
Me too.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.000
I always get dragged around,
doing things I don't like.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.920
Mmm. What do you want to do?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.120
Ooh...

03:10.120 --> 03:12.680
Nobody's ever asked me that before.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.600
I...

03:14.600 --> 03:17.120
I want to make Bag Angels in the
snow!

03:17.120 --> 03:18.200
OK! Come on, Bag!

03:19.200 --> 03:20.600
Oh! Eh, hang on!

03:22.280 --> 03:25.560
Got Bag, back soon! Righto, dear!

03:40.560 --> 03:44.520
Er...you might want to... You
know...

03:44.520 --> 03:46.000
Ooh! Yes.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.280
Champion.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.600
Not bad. Enjoyed it.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.720
Best Bag Angel I've seen.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.560
Uh-huh! Now what?

04:00.560 --> 04:03.400
Ooh, erm... Er... Fill me with snow!

04:05.240 --> 04:11.040
No, no! Bad idea! Bad idea!
BAD IDEA! BRRR!

04:11.040 --> 04:12.880
Come on, Sarah.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.040
Have a go!

04:14.040 --> 04:15.280
Ra! Huh!

04:15.280 --> 04:16.560
Yes!

04:17.680 --> 04:19.440
Oh.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.720
Rubbish.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.200
Not bad, not bad.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.320
Slurp!

04:29.320 --> 04:31.680
Boring.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.400
There!

04:39.360 --> 04:41.080
What do you think?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.600
Mmm. Handsome chap, this.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.400
Phew. Without a doubt

04:48.400 --> 04:51.680
and rendered in the perfect medium,
I might add.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.800
Hmm!

04:53.800 --> 04:55.600
QUACK QUACK

04:55.600 --> 05:00.520
Here you go, Duck. What are you
playing at? Ooh! Sorry, Bag.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.080
QUACK QUACK!

05:07.880 --> 05:11.440
Hmm. I wonder how Duck's getting on.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.920
Hmm! Time to go back.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.600
Come by, come by!

05:16.600 --> 05:19.280
WHISTLES

05:19.280 --> 05:23.240
Ooh! Tres bien!

05:25.280 --> 05:28.280
Waah! Er... I didn't dribble, did
I?

05:28.280 --> 05:30.280
Voila!

05:36.520 --> 05:39.960
Uh, that's enough excitement for me,
I think. Thank you.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.920
Uh-huh! Come on, Bag.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.200
Bag! You seem almost...happy!

05:54.200 --> 05:58.240
Aye... I mean, well, just look at
'er go!

05:58.240 --> 06:00.760
I wouldn't have her any other way.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.840
QUACK QUACK!

06:08.040 --> 06:10.720
Hello, Duck! He-he!

06:10.720 --> 06:12.080
QUACK!

06:12.080 --> 06:15.000
What do you reckon?
Fancy giving it another go?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.560
Yes! Coming, Bag?

06:17.560 --> 06:19.640
Hey, why not!

06:19.640 --> 06:21.080
Y'only live once!

06:22.960 --> 06:25.320
Here you go! Woohoo!

06:25.320 --> 06:27.720
Come here, you! Whoa-ah-ah!

06:27.720 --> 06:30.960
I've changed my mind,
I've changed my MIND!

06:35.000 --> 06:37.760
He-he! Thank you, Duck!

06:39.960 --> 06:41.880
Whoa!

06:42.920 --> 06:44.360
QUACK QUACK QUACK!

06:45.480 --> 06:48.680
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK

06:48.680 --> 06:50.760
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

06:50.760 --> 06:54.400
