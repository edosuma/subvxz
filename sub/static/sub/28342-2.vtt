"How can they marry?
They're stepsiblings?"

Ben, I really don't like

Well, Felix Wade
is the biggest bundler
in the party,

00:57.333 --> 00:59.208
and he loves making
millionaires square dance.

00:59.291 --> 01:02.333
Bad news, ma'am.
The US Attorney's Office
in New York

01:02.417 --> 01:05.333
has empaneled a grand jury
to investigate the Meyer Fund,

01:05.417 --> 01:07.208

we're swingin' together!

01:12.125 --> 01:13.500
I would have invited my wife,

01:13.583 --> 01:15.250
but she's a squirter,
and that dress

01:15.333 --> 01:17.041
doesn't look like
it's been Scotch-guarded.

Welcome to my 16th Annual
Discovery Weekend.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.041
We're here in Aspen

01:39.125 --> 01:42.000
to build bridges
to the future.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.375
Bridges made of ideas.

No wonder the rest

I've waited
a long time for this.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.875
I guess Felix Wade always
thought I was--

02:04.959 --> 02:07.917
- Ben: A lightweight?
- Goddamnit, I hate that word.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.500
- Why? You're so skinny.
- N-- Oh. Yeah.

02:10.583 --> 02:12.583
Ma'am. Ma'am.
I ran a little intel,

02:12.667 --> 02:14.625
and apparently
the secret
to Felix Wade

02:14.709 --> 02:16.917
is to always repeat
the last two sentences
that he says.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.208
Oh, come on.
That is idiotic.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.333
- That's what I said.
- Is he really  that insecure?

02:21.417 --> 02:24.792
Come on, that is idiotic.
He's really  that insecure?

02:24.875 --> 02:27.083
- Right? Gary gets it.
- Felix: Madam President.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.792
- Oh, Felix!
- I am thrilled

02:28.875 --> 02:31.834
that you finally got lured to
one of our little get-togethers.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.458
Well, I'll tell ya a secret,

02:33.542 --> 02:35.834
it's the only reason
I'm really running
for president.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.125
( laughing )

02:37.208 --> 02:38.458
Really? I feel like

02:38.542 --> 02:40.625
you should have
a better reason than that.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.959
Uh-- Um... Well--

02:43.041 --> 02:45.083
Felix, can I talk to you
for a moment?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.625
It's been a delight.
I will see you later.

02:46.709 --> 02:47.625
It has been a delight,

02:47.709 --> 02:48.917
and you shall see me later.

02:49.041 --> 02:50.834
Thank you very much.

02:50.917 --> 02:55.250
OK. Isn't it astounding
that the next President
of the United States

02:55.333 --> 02:58.792
is being chosen by a closeted
ex-record producer?

02:58.875 --> 03:02.291
The Electoral College
hasn't exactly been
hitting it out of the park.

03:02.375 --> 03:05.834
And is it just me,
or does Felix's friend
seem a little young?

03:05.917 --> 03:08.458
He'll look older after
Felix switches blood with him.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.625
Ma'am, Felix Wade's sexuality
is the worst best-kept secret

03:10.709 --> 03:12.792
since Clyde Tolson's
hysterical pregnancy.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.875
The man lives in a vast
invisible closet.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.834
- Sounds amazing.
- Amy: I'm gonna be sick.

03:18.208 --> 03:21.542
Wow. It always
has to be about her.

03:21.625 --> 03:22.625
- Never fails.
- Every time.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.208
Can you see if
they can make me

03:24.291 --> 03:25.500
a specialty cocktail?

03:25.583 --> 03:26.917
- Of course.
- Thank you.

an upset stomach,

03:43.041 --> 03:45.709

to anyone--

03:58.834 --> 04:00.000

Hey, is Kim here?

04:05.291 --> 04:07.875
No, she got fired
for sleeping with you.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.750
Buzzfeed runs
a notoriously
tight ship.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.250
I should probably thank you.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.458
You are lookin' at the new
Deputy Senior Editor.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.000
They're puttin' me up,
and all I gotta do

04:16.083 --> 04:17.916
is sit on some panel
for new media innovators.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.750
What do you know
about new media,

04:19.834 --> 04:22.417

04:27.792 --> 04:29.166

- Right.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.000
Ma'am. Ma'am, ma'am.
Guess what?

04:31.083 --> 04:32.834
- Amy's bulimic.
- What?!

04:32.917 --> 04:34.667
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah!

04:34.750 --> 04:36.291
And I'll tell ya something,
she might want to consider

04:36.375 --> 04:38.458
a little more purging,
a little less bingeing.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.750
God, that girl
can't do anything right.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.959

- Kent: Amy, you got

04:43.041 --> 04:45.041
some vomit on your mustache.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.417
Selina:
What the Rocky Mountain fuck?!

04:47.500 --> 04:50.625
Ben! I thought I was
the only candidate
invited to this thing.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.333
- So I was told.
- So why don't you
go find out?

04:53.417 --> 04:55.291
Amy:
I'm gonna shut it down, ma'am.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.000
Uh-- Tom!

04:57.083 --> 04:59.667
Look what the Gulfstream
dragged in.

04:59.750 --> 05:04.083
Gosh, I didn't see
a TED talk for fake folksiness
on the schedule.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.458
4:30.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.333
Kent, can you remind me
real quick,

05:07.417 --> 05:10.166
how many points
am I beating Tom by?

05:10.250 --> 05:12.458
Des Moines Register
says 18 points.

05:12.542 --> 05:14.417
Ooh, 18 points!
Oh, my goodness!

05:14.500 --> 05:16.333
That makes me moister
than an oyster.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.583
- Plus or minus four points.
- OK, still pretty moist.

05:18.667 --> 05:21.125
- Although a lot of Iowans
no longer have landlines.
- It's fine.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.959
Senator James,
we need to keep moving.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.917
Ma'am.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.792
Good Lord, what's up with
Frigid Von Pole-Up-Her-Ass?

05:28.875 --> 05:31.583
That is my Deputy Chief
of Staff, Michelle York.

05:31.667 --> 05:32.834
She's basically my Amy.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.875
- Well, my Amy has bulimia.
- Yeah.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.625
- No one likes
a braggart, Selina.
- Tom, what are you doing here?

05:37.709 --> 05:39.834
Just an old friend of Felix's,
and I guess he thought

05:39.917 --> 05:42.000
I might enjoy a weekend
in Aspen.

05:42.083 --> 05:45.458
- Uh-huh.
- Make some... new  friends.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.500
- Good morning, jerk-offs.
- All: Morning, ma'am.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.375
Ma'am, apparently last night

05:53.458 --> 05:57.625
Tom and Felix ended up
closing down the Casamigos
Tequila Ideas Bar together.

05:57.709 --> 06:01.250
Now Felix's people
are saying that he wants to
choose between you and Tom.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.625
Oh, come on.
Son of a dick!

06:03.709 --> 06:06.208
I want all eyes on Tom now.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.458
He cannot spend
another second with Felix

06:08.542 --> 06:10.125
without me jammed
in between 'em

06:10.208 --> 06:12.542
like the cross-piece
on an Eiffel Tower three-way.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.583
MMF. The Devil's threesome.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.041
Isn't that Senator Talbot
over there?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.208
She used to run the SDNY.

06:18.291 --> 06:21.542
- She might be able to help us
with the Andrew situation.
- Yeah.

06:21.625 --> 06:24.458
Gary, go and get her for me
right now.

06:24.542 --> 06:27.542
I actually consider her
to be a bit of a protégée.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.750
- Does she know that?
- Thought I was your protégée.

06:29.834 --> 06:33.250
- No, you're Ben's protégée.
- Ben: Not a very good one.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.250
You know something, ma'am?
Senator Talbot

06:35.333 --> 06:37.041
might not be a terrible choice
for a running mate.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.667
An all-female ticket?
I don't think so.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.917
( laughs )
The American people
work hard for a living, OK?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.750
They don't need
that kind of bullshit!

06:44.834 --> 06:46.542
- Ma'am, Senator Talbot.
- Madam President.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.750
Kemi! Oh, my God,
my protégée!

06:48.834 --> 06:51.375
- Oh! Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.917
- I'm Amy--
- Oh, no, no! You!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.959
- How are things on the Hill?
- Crazy as ever.

06:55.041 --> 06:57.917
Did Senator Isles
try and... grab your ass?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
- Oh, yeah.
- He used to say that mine
was like a candy apple.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.667
- Gary: Mmm.
- ( laughs )

07:02.750 --> 07:04.709
Actually, Senator Isles
is under investigation
right now, so...

07:04.792 --> 07:06.625
For what?

07:06.709 --> 07:08.083
For the inappropriate--

07:08.166 --> 07:10.959
Oh, yeah, right.
'Cause that's bad now.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.208
Gary: Ma'am,
Tom James is on the move.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.834
I-- So good to see you!

07:14.917 --> 07:16.750
So good to see you,
Madam President.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.083
Just-- Yeah.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.917
Oh, look at you outside!

07:24.875 --> 07:26.583
- Oh, Tom!
- Are you all right?

07:26.667 --> 07:29.083
Wow, that is so incredible!
I did not see you there.

07:29.166 --> 07:32.000
Well, that's funny that
you sprinted around
the entire deck

07:32.083 --> 07:34.417
to just bump into me
sight unseen.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.125
So, uh, I heard you had
a very big night

07:37.208 --> 07:38.625
with Felix last night.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.291
You really
should have been there.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.667
One thing I've learned
in politics,

07:41.750 --> 07:44.291
a lot of the best stuff
happens afterhours.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.458
Oh, is that so,
Captain Morgan?

07:46.542 --> 07:48.166
Thank you so much
for man-telling me that.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.125
I believe the word
you're fumbling for
is "mansplaining."

07:51.208 --> 07:54.166
- Man-- OK-- splain--
- Michelle: Senator,
we have to go.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.375
Madam President.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.750
Yeah.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.542
I got a picture.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.166
Of what?

08:02.250 --> 08:03.709
Of his Amy?

08:03.792 --> 08:05.250
His who?

08:05.333 --> 08:06.542
His Amy.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.667
- Ma'am, I don't see it.
- Seriously?

08:08.750 --> 08:10.041
With this? And the...

08:10.125 --> 08:11.834
No, ma'am, I got a picture
of his schedule.

08:11.917 --> 08:15.000
Presentation on compost
at the Treehouse Theater,
9:00 a.m.

08:15.083 --> 08:17.333
Felix will be there
with him. OK, I'm--

08:17.417 --> 08:20.166
Amy, seriously,
I know I rarely say this,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.667
- but that  was really--
- Gary: O...K.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.917
- Did you see what
she had for breakfast?
- Yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.375
And I bet she had
a breakfast before
that breakfast.

08:28.458 --> 08:29.917
There is no doubt
about that.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.375
OK, let's go to compost.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.667
- OK? What is compost?
- I don't...

08:33.750 --> 08:35.958
What I think we'd really
like to get at, Congressman,

08:36.041 --> 08:38.250
is, what sets you apart
from the other candidates?

08:38.332 --> 08:41.457
Well, for one thing, uh,
I have a lot of new ideas.

08:41.542 --> 08:42.833
Oh.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.834
And what are some
of those new ideas?

08:46.917 --> 08:49.834
Well, science tells us
that it will be difficult...

08:49.917 --> 08:53.709
but within five years,
I want America...

08:53.792 --> 08:56.458
to put a man
on Ellen DeGeneres.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.083
( laughs )
Up top!

09:01.291 --> 09:03.792
- Thank you, Richard.
- I didn't think
you'd do that one.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.500
It's pretty good, right?

09:05.583 --> 09:07.917
- It's great, thank you.
- Jonah: She's a lesbian.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.166
- No, we get it.
- Right.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.667
- We get the joke.
- OK.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.625
Congressman Ryan,
I'd like you to address

09:12.709 --> 09:14.792
some rumors that have
been circulating online

09:14.875 --> 09:16.333
that you made
inappropriate advances

09:16.417 --> 09:18.125
toward a female staffer
on Capitol Hill.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.917
I'm sorry. Derek,
can we have a minute?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.875
Just one moment.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.917
( clears throat ) Apparently,

09:25.000 --> 09:26.583
there's been
an anonymous posting

09:26.667 --> 09:29.417
about a "dead-eyed,
lantern-jawed,

09:29.500 --> 09:30.875
one-and-done Congresstard"

09:30.959 --> 09:33.834
who acted in a sexually
inappropriate manner?

09:33.917 --> 09:36.000
- Well, that could be anybody.
- Sounds like you.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.709
Jonah, who have you traumatized?
Start with the doctor
who delivered you.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.417
- I haven't traumatized anyone.
- There was your aide,
Emma Gray.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.333
Oh, Schnozz?
She was stuck up, I was
just callin' her on it.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.083
Congresswomen Troy
and Vasconi.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.625
Oh, Monster Tits
and Monster Tits, Jr.?

09:48.709 --> 09:51.500
But all I did there
was express some genuine concern

09:51.583 --> 09:54.083
that they had bras
big enough to handle
all that meat.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.583
At the Congressional
Prayer Breakfast.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.667
Yeah. It was exactly
what Jesus would have done.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.041
I mean, he's a man too, Teddy.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.208
OK, listen. Jonah...

10:01.291 --> 10:02.792
if anyone asks,

10:02.875 --> 10:04.792
tell 'em you've been
chemically castrated.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.458
It's very easy to lie about.

10:06.542 --> 10:08.125
Believe me, nobody checks.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.208
OK.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.542
- Selina: Well, that was
a waste of time.
- Gary: Here's some Purell.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.083
I need, like,
a tub of this stuff.

10:16.166 --> 10:18.125
- Ben: Where have you been?
- Dan: Tom and Felix

10:18.208 --> 10:20.458
spent the entire morning
French-braiding
each other's bald spots.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.166
Somebody's gotta go in there
and lure Felix out.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.000
- OK, I can--
- Dan.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.166
- Dan.
- Yeah, Dan.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.792
Yeah, that feels right.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.834
I hope he's
Felix's type.

10:29.917 --> 10:31.291
In current gay parlance,

10:31.375 --> 10:33.291
Dan presents somewhere
between a "wolf" and an "otter,"

10:33.375 --> 10:34.875
some would call
a "frost otter."

10:34.959 --> 10:36.333
Felix:
It's always...

10:36.417 --> 10:38.166
Mr. Wade, I was wondering
if I could steal steal you--

10:38.250 --> 10:40.041
Fly away, please,
we're busy.

10:40.125 --> 10:43.125
- Boy Toy 1: Bye, Dan.
- Boy Toy 2: Nice try, Grandma,

10:43.208 --> 10:46.166
but you aged out of Felix's demo
back in the 20th century.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.000
Uh, I'm 39-and-a-half.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.166
You may want to start
coloring that gray.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.083
Just a thought.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.583
Bye, now.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.291
- What-- Dan?
- I need a minute.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.834
- Gary: Ooh.
- What's wrong with him?

10:59.917 --> 11:02.542
( groans ) Something's
going around or something,

11:02.625 --> 11:06.250
- 'cause my stomach is--
- Amy, please.
We all know, OK?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.583
And I would give you
one word of advice,

11:08.667 --> 11:12.041
which is to try laxatives.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.458
I'll tell you why.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.875
It saves your teeth.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.875
Ma'am-- I'm pregnant.

11:17.959 --> 11:20.458
( laughing )

11:22.959 --> 11:24.709
Can you imagine?

11:24.792 --> 11:26.375
I'm pregnant.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.959
- That's not funny.
- Now I'm  gonna be sick.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.709
- How did that happen?
- One night. With Dan. I don't--

11:31.792 --> 11:33.542
- Dan fucked you?
- Mm-hmm.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.417
What, were you wearing
a full-length mirror?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.208
That's tough,
but fair.

11:37.291 --> 11:39.917
God Almighty,
shoulda had you fixed
years ago.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.542
Listen, I did not spend
my entire life

11:42.625 --> 11:44.750
defending a woman's
right to choose

11:44.834 --> 11:46.166
for you to choose this.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.875
- ( gagging )
- Jesus Christ.

11:47.959 --> 11:50.166
( clapping ) Bravo.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.125
- Oh, Felix.
- I can't count
the number of times

11:53.208 --> 11:54.875
I've wanted to say
the same thing.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.625
Do you know that
there's one girl

11:56.709 --> 11:59.959
that worked in my office
who had four  kids.

12:00.041 --> 12:03.250
- What was she, a possum?
- Actually Korean,
but that's very funny.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.917
Selina, would you care to take
a little nature walk with me?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.500
Oh, I would care to do that.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.250
Thank you. ( laughs )

12:09.333 --> 12:11.875
- No? No.
- Yep.

12:11.959 --> 12:15.250
The thing I realized
about hip hop
before anyone else

12:15.333 --> 12:17.583
is that the artists

12:17.667 --> 12:19.667
would sign away
the publishing rights

12:19.750 --> 12:22.667
- for next to nothing!
- ( both laughing )

12:22.750 --> 12:25.250
Selina:
That's an incredible
anecdote!

12:25.333 --> 12:26.750
You know, Selina,
to be honest,

12:26.834 --> 12:28.417
I've been telling people
for years

12:28.500 --> 12:30.291
that you're
a bit of a lightweight.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.500
Well, O-- Yes, I mean,

12:32.583 --> 12:35.583
I can  be a bit of a--
a lightweight.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.333
You said it, not me!

12:37.417 --> 12:40.583
But it takes a brave person
to be able to see
one's shortcomings.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.375
- Yeah, it does.
- In this day and age,

12:42.458 --> 12:44.458
- it's very, very  refre--
- Remarkable.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.542
- Refreshing.
- Refreshing
was the word I meant.

12:46.625 --> 12:48.041
- Exactly.
- Thank you. Yes.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.959
You know,
we do this little thing here

12:51.041 --> 12:52.792
called
the Marshmallow Roast Talk.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.750
Do you think you could
throw together a few remarks?

12:54.834 --> 12:57.792
Because I really want to hear
more of what you have to say.

12:57.875 --> 13:00.667
You know, I  want to hear more
of what you  have to say.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.500
I would suspect
that I have many guests here

13:02.583 --> 13:04.959
that would like to hear
what I have to say
about what you have to say.

13:05.041 --> 13:07.625
That brain of yours
is fascinating to me!

13:07.709 --> 13:09.375
It scares me sometimes.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.792
Teddy:
Jonah, your accuser is here.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.792
Ms. White. Thank you...

13:13.875 --> 13:15.166
so much for joining us.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.458
The congressman
has something prepared

13:18.542 --> 13:20.959
and very heartfelt

13:21.041 --> 13:22.709
he would like
to say to you.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.125
I'm sorry, Amanda,
if I behaved in a way

13:26.208 --> 13:28.375
that made you uncomfortable
or inappropriate.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.917
All right?  God!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.792
And you should try
smiling more.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.625
We have this
non-disclosure
agreement

13:34.709 --> 13:37.208
for you to sign
in exchange--

13:37.291 --> 13:39.041
Actually, I was hoping

13:39.125 --> 13:41.583
Jonah could sign
my  non-disclosure agreement.

13:41.667 --> 13:45.125
It says that as far as
the law is concerned,
we never dated.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.625
( laughs ) I'm sorry,
there's no way
I'm gonna sign that.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.625
You are a stone-cold,
neck-down hottie.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.250
I want the whole world
to know we dated.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.667
We had one  working lunch,
and we split the bill.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.667
I split the bill
on all my dates.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.834
Why would I pay for a girl
to get fatter?

13:57.917 --> 14:00.709
- ( laughs ) He's such a--
- Ew! It was strictly
professional!

14:00.792 --> 14:03.625
There was nothing  professional
about my behavior!

14:03.709 --> 14:05.083
Nothing happened, Mr. Ryan.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.208
I'm in a relationship
with a good, normal  man,

14:08.291 --> 14:10.291
who loves me.
Yeah, normal.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.917
But if he were to find out that
we even had lunch together,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.583
I'm not sure he'd be
strong enough to stand it.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.875
God, Jamaican jerk Jesus,
just sign this!

14:17.959 --> 14:19.667
No, Teddy!

14:19.750 --> 14:22.125
Jonah Ryan will not be silenced.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.125
We dated...

14:25.208 --> 14:27.166
and the world's
gonna know that.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.333
Woman:
Madam President, Felix is going
to introduce you.

14:30.417 --> 14:31.875
Here's your
marshmallow stick.

14:31.959 --> 14:34.291
Oh, that's very exciting,
isn't it? OK.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.792
( clears throat )

14:38.000 --> 14:40.208
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, shit.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.917
Just wanted to say
congratulations, Selina.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.834
- Oh.
- I did everything I could

14:44.917 --> 14:46.625
to get Felix to give me
the marshmallow speech.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.083
He's not the greatest listener.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.583
Did you offer to blow him?

14:49.667 --> 14:51.083
Tut-tut, Selina.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.208
We do not refer to Mr. Wade's
sexual orientation.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.458
- Sorry.
- But yes. Yes, I did.

14:55.542 --> 14:58.000
Well, I didn't tell him
you were a lousy lay.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.458
Probably read it
in our books.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.500
( sardonic laughter )

15:03.667 --> 15:05.208
I love you.

15:05.291 --> 15:08.542
I love you too, Tom.
Go fuck  yourself.

15:08.625 --> 15:10.000
- Aide: Ma'am.
- Oh, yes. Yeah.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.250
Selina, I mean it.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.875
You're in my head
all the time.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.000
You always have been
and you always will be.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.458
- Yeah, yeah.
- I love you.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.458
- Ma'am.
- Yeah--

15:20.542 --> 15:22.667
- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
- Ma'am.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.375
( guests applauding )

15:26.583 --> 15:28.250
Oh, here she is!

15:28.333 --> 15:30.542
Selina:
Here. I can't hold this.
I can't.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.834
Oh, wow. Um...

15:34.917 --> 15:36.834
uh, thank you, Felix,

15:36.917 --> 15:39.458
for this incredible opportunity.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.792
I don't-- I don't, uh, think

15:41.875 --> 15:43.917
it's controversial for--

15:44.000 --> 15:46.375
for me to say to you...

15:49.375 --> 15:51.166
Uh, I mean, ya know,

15:51.250 --> 15:53.083
um...

15:53.166 --> 15:57.125
the movers and shakers
who confront the, uh,

15:57.208 --> 15:59.667
ya know, um, uh...

15:59.750 --> 16:02.291
challenges...
( laughing )

16:02.375 --> 16:04.375
...uh, that we face,
both, ya know,

16:04.458 --> 16:07.959
abroad and, um, and, um, um,

16:08.041 --> 16:09.667
ya know, at home.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.834
Uh, we...

16:11.917 --> 16:13.166
argggh!

16:13.250 --> 16:16.166
- What is happening here?
- I have no idea.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.166
Ya know, leadership, ya know,

16:18.250 --> 16:22.834
uh, I mean, is a tricky... um...

16:22.917 --> 16:25.166
- ( Selina stuttering )
- She's having
a textbook aneurysm.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.667
Still looks like a goddess.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.709
...and--and--and--and--and, uh,

16:29.792 --> 16:31.792
th-that's tricky.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.000
- Selina: Tom?
- Yeah?

16:34.083 --> 16:36.458
- Can I talk to you
just for a second?
- Sure.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.166
OK...
let me have it.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.917
Hey, you don't get to smile
about this, OK?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.041
What are you,
some sort of sociopath?

16:46.125 --> 16:49.375
That was the most
humiliating experience

16:49.458 --> 16:53.166
I've had in my entire life,
and I was Vice President

16:53.250 --> 16:55.583
- of the United States--
- I had a heart attack.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.750
- What?
- Eight months ago.

16:57.834 --> 17:01.041
Quadruple bypass,
the old James ticker.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.709
Which, I was all for it
when it killed my dad,

17:03.792 --> 17:06.625
but it's not so funny
when the shoe's on
the other ventricle.

17:06.709 --> 17:09.959
( speaks louder )
Which I thought
you might be interested in.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.458
- Right. No, I think it is--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:11.541 --> 17:13.375
- No, you're good.
- No problem.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.541
- That was in Iraq,
Senator James?
- Afghanistan.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.208
In Afghanistan, OK.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.040
Wait a minute,
what are you saying?

17:19.125 --> 17:21.541
I was lying there
with a lot of tubes
and wires

17:21.625 --> 17:23.541
sticking out of me,
and all I could think was

17:23.625 --> 17:25.458
all the things I wished
I'd said to you

17:25.541 --> 17:27.959
and things I wished I'd done,
we'd done.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.583
I had a heart attack too.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.083
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.750
I did. Really.
About a year and a half ago.

17:34.834 --> 17:37.291
We-- We covered
the whole thing up.

17:37.375 --> 17:40.333
We called mine a "routine
prostate procedure."

17:40.417 --> 17:42.250
Well, yeah,
men have it so easy.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.959
People assumed
I was having a face-lift.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.917
And then when I did
have a face-lift,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.208
I had to tell everybody
I was visiting the troops.

17:49.291 --> 17:52.333
When I had my  face-lift,
we told people that you
were having a face-lift.

17:52.417 --> 17:55.125
( laughs softly )

17:58.542 --> 18:00.291
( clears throat )

18:00.375 --> 18:03.083
So...

18:03.166 --> 18:04.959
you love me?

18:06.291 --> 18:08.500
Maybe there's...

18:08.583 --> 18:09.959
an alternate universe

18:10.041 --> 18:11.500
where we're not in politics,

18:11.583 --> 18:13.458
we're just...

18:13.542 --> 18:15.959
unhappily married
somewhere in the suburbs.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.458
Uh-huh. And you work
at a car dealership?

18:18.542 --> 18:20.041
Assistant manager.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.458
- Oh! Look at you!
- And we argue about

18:22.542 --> 18:24.625
how much money
we're spending
on landscaping,

18:24.709 --> 18:27.792
and I think you flirt
a little too much with
the kids' tennis coach.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.583
- And then we blow
each other's brain's out.
- Yeah.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.875
( sighs )

18:40.542 --> 18:42.750
- Now, see, this...
- ( Selina mumbles )

18:42.834 --> 18:44.375
more of my bad timing.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.959
Unless somebody...

18:49.041 --> 18:51.417
drops out of the race.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.834
Let's face it,

18:53.917 --> 18:55.333
if you were the kind of woman
who'd choose me

18:55.417 --> 18:57.166
over the presidency,

18:57.250 --> 19:00.458
I wouldn't want you
so crazily.

19:00.542 --> 19:04.583
I'm gonna kick your ass
all over the electoral map.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.083
Good night, Selina.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.291
( breathless )
Oh, God.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.041
Oh! There you are.
( laughing )

19:18.125 --> 19:20.625
- You saw the whole thing,
didn't ya?
- I did.

19:20.709 --> 19:25.625
How about a hot soak
with a Laura Mercier bath bomb?

19:25.709 --> 19:26.834
Ahhhh...

19:26.917 --> 19:29.000
Is it gonna explode
between my legs

19:29.083 --> 19:30.917
and make me cum
until I cry?

19:32.375 --> 19:34.291
I think it's peppermint.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.041
( exhales )

19:39.125 --> 19:41.625
You OK, Dan?

19:41.709 --> 19:44.500
Ames, am I gettin' old?
I swear, I feel like
I'm five minutes away

19:44.583 --> 19:47.166
from fiber supplements
and voting in midterms.

19:47.250 --> 19:50.166
- I mean, we all are.
- Maybe I gotta stop
foolin' around.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.583
Maybe that's it.
Maybe I gotta cut out

19:52.667 --> 19:55.417
all the meaningless sex
with girls half my age.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.542
I mean, you pull it out
to cum on her tits

19:57.625 --> 19:59.625
'cause you think
it's gonna make you feel alive.

19:59.709 --> 20:01.333
But it doesn't matter
where you cum, Ames.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.375
Ya know? It just doesn't.
It just--

20:04.458 --> 20:06.000
- It doesn't.
- Yeah.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.792
Sometimes it's good
to think about the future.

20:10.583 --> 20:14.041
( chuckles )
Don't know what
I'd do without you.

20:15.542 --> 20:16.959
Dan:
The future...

20:21.583 --> 20:22.959
Selina:
OK, after last night,

20:23.041 --> 20:25.041
none of these masturbators
of the universe

20:25.125 --> 20:26.458
are even looking me
in the eye

20:26.542 --> 20:28.834
ever since Felix
decided to back Tom.

20:28.917 --> 20:30.875
And isn't that Tom over there
with your protégée?

20:30.959 --> 20:32.000
What? Who?

20:33.834 --> 20:35.834
Ben:
Ooh, Tom and Kemi
would be a formidable ticket.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.959
They could reassure people
that look like him

20:38.041 --> 20:39.750
that their country
wouldn't be ruined

20:39.834 --> 20:40.917
by people that look like her.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.208
Goddamnit!

20:43.291 --> 20:46.083
- Amy: Take a few
deep breaths first.
- Don't tell me how to breathe.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.000
Good morning.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.792
Hey, Felix, can I talk to you
for a quick second?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.291
We've said everything
we need to.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.875
Ya know? Like you
repeatedly said last night.

20:54.959 --> 20:59.667
Well, you know how you
finance guys like to talk
about disrupting things?

20:59.750 --> 21:03.000
How about we disrupt
the election?

21:04.041 --> 21:05.083
Scatter.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.458
Yeah, like now.

21:06.542 --> 21:09.166
- Get out.
- Ohh.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.750
- Tell me more, Selina.
- Yeah.

21:10.834 --> 21:11.959
I'm addicted to disruption,

21:12.041 --> 21:13.834
especially since
I stopped using cocaine.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.417
( laughing )

21:16.500 --> 21:17.667
You're--

21:17.750 --> 21:18.959
You're s--

21:19.041 --> 21:21.125
Um, good for you.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.000
Um, we, um...

21:24.083 --> 21:26.709
we don't wait
for the convention, Felix.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.834
I name my running mate now.

21:29.917 --> 21:34.375
Even before the Iowa caucus.
No one has ever  done that
before.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.500
- I love it. This is exciting.
- You do? I'm excited too.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.500
- Was this your idea?
- Yeah, but I'm gonna
tell you something.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.000
You gave me the idea.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.959
I'm not shocked about that.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.333
- ( glass clinking )
- Jonah: Thank you
for having me.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.208
A lot of you knew me
when I was really little

21:48.291 --> 21:49.834
and I was just running
around in diapers.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.667
- ( laughter )
- And now here we are,

21:51.750 --> 21:53.667
and a lot of you
are wearin' diapers.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.333
( Beth cackles )

21:56.417 --> 22:00.083
Well, you might all know
that old chestnut,
"Mother knows best"?

22:00.166 --> 22:02.417
- All: Oh...
- I think there's
a lot of truth in that.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.208
Jonie, look!
They're talking about you
on the television!

22:05.291 --> 22:06.458
Turn it up!

22:06.542 --> 22:07.750
Richard:
"Lyin' Ryan."

22:07.834 --> 22:09.417
( laughs )
That's gonna stick.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.959
Jonah Ryan and I
have not ever dated,

22:13.041 --> 22:15.417
nor gone on a date
of any kind.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.083
That's not true.

22:17.166 --> 22:18.542
We had one meal together,

22:18.625 --> 22:21.083
but it was strictly
professional

22:21.166 --> 22:23.417
and in the presence of others.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.709
It was really
more of a group thing.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.125
( snorts ) C-Come on.

22:27.208 --> 22:30.208
He once tried to friend me
on Facebook,

22:30.291 --> 22:31.875
and I did that thing

22:31.959 --> 22:35.041
where I never responded
"yes" or "no,"

22:35.125 --> 22:38.166
hoping-- praying--

22:38.250 --> 22:39.625
that it would end.

22:39.709 --> 22:41.208
( crying )
His behavior was

22:41.291 --> 22:43.125
completely appropriate
at all times.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.041
Ohh, no! I was all over her!

22:45.125 --> 22:46.500
I got super  handsy!

22:46.583 --> 22:48.250
For too long
women have been silent

22:48.333 --> 22:50.667
in the face of rumors they went
out with Congressman Ryan.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.500
But finally, people are
starting to believe women,

22:53.583 --> 22:58.041
and I believe Amanda
when she says, "Not me.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.834
Not. Me."

22:59.917 --> 23:01.166
That's catchy too.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.417
Felix, um, I'd like

23:02.500 --> 23:06.083
to introduce you
to Senator, uh, Alohak--

23:06.166 --> 23:07.542
Oluwakemi.

23:07.625 --> 23:08.834
Yes. Talbot.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.333
Kemi is the future

23:11.417 --> 23:12.750
of our party.

23:12.834 --> 23:16.041
An... all-female ticket?

23:16.125 --> 23:18.417
The first one since
Carter-Mondale.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.583
( Selina laughs )

23:19.667 --> 23:20.667
I'm not mad at that.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.291
- Kemi, is it?
- It is.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.166
Would you care to take
a little nature walk
with Selina and me?

23:24.250 --> 23:26.291
- Absolutely.
- Tom: I love nature.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.834
Mind if I tag along?

23:27.917 --> 23:29.250
No, Tom.

23:29.333 --> 23:30.667
That would be awkward.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.792
I've changed my mind again.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.667
Ya know.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.500
( knocking )

23:40.542 --> 23:41.667
- Yeah.
- I've been thinking

23:41.750 --> 23:43.000
a lot about what you said,

23:43.083 --> 23:45.875
so maybe it's time
for us to settle down

23:45.959 --> 23:48.291
- and raise our baby, and--
- I'm so sorry.

23:48.375 --> 23:51.875
I'm just about to fuck
this really hot 19-year-old
cater waitress. OK?

23:51.959 --> 23:54.125
Oh, and get this.
Her name's Meagan.

23:54.208 --> 23:57.375
- Ohhhh...
- ( Dan laughing )

24:00.542 --> 24:03.000
Hi. Yes, I would like
to schedule an appointment

24:03.083 --> 24:04.500
with one of your OB/GYNs.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.542
Yes, it's for an abortion.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.417
Yes, I'm sure.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.333
Oh, do you also do flu shots?

24:17.542 --> 24:18.417
Hey.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.208
Oh!

24:22.792 --> 24:24.500
Kent:
Congratulations, ma'am.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.542
Mr. Wade has officially
chosen you to sit next to him

24:26.625 --> 24:29.083
- at tonight's farewell dinner.
- ( laughs )

24:29.166 --> 24:30.583
Show me some money!

24:30.667 --> 24:32.709
- "The."
- The what?

24:32.792 --> 24:35.000
- The money. "Show me the--"
- No.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.750
Gary:
( laughing ) All right!

24:36.834 --> 24:38.542
Who wants some prosecco?

24:38.625 --> 24:40.875
No one. Literally no one
ever wants prosecco.

24:40.959 --> 24:42.333
- Give me that.
- Ben: Ma'am,

24:42.417 --> 24:43.875
you're gonna be
drowning in money so dark

24:43.959 --> 24:45.959
it could get shot
entering its own apartment.

24:46.041 --> 24:48.417
( laughs ) We gotta leak this
everywhere,  OK?

24:48.500 --> 24:51.667
Seriously, it's America's
first two-cooter ticket.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.667
- Look great on a button.
- And Mike works for
the internet now, right?

24:54.750 --> 24:56.917
- Tell him we got a big scoop.
- Ben: Texting him now.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.542
I saw him earlier
at the sundae bar

24:58.625 --> 25:00.667
struggling with
the sprinkle dispenser.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.709
Ma'am, do you want
to pick out an outfit
for tonight?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.208
- Oh, yes. Good.
- This color's
actually quite strong.

25:04.291 --> 25:05.375
- Ma'am.
- What?

25:05.458 --> 25:07.041
You are not
going to believe it.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.375
Tom James
is fucking Michelle.

25:09.458 --> 25:10.542
- Who?
- Who?

25:10.625 --> 25:12.959
His Deputy Chief of Staff.

25:13.041 --> 25:15.208
- Who is that?
- I don't know who that is.

25:15.291 --> 25:18.333
- His Amy!
- ( gasps ) Oh-ho-ho!

25:18.417 --> 25:19.709
What?!

25:19.792 --> 25:22.542
How dare that smooth shitsack

25:22.625 --> 25:25.875
cheat on his wife
and risk his political future

25:25.959 --> 25:27.542
with someone that's not me?

25:27.625 --> 25:29.750
What about this?
I think it complements

25:29.834 --> 25:31.542
Felix's spray tan
really well.

25:31.625 --> 25:34.458
He doesn't give a shit.
Just because Felix Wade

25:34.542 --> 25:37.500
is gayer than an Eames chair
in assless leather chaps

25:37.583 --> 25:39.583
doesn't mean that he's
some sort of fashion diva.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.542
Can you-- Arrghh.

25:41.625 --> 25:42.917
Where is  Tom James?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.875
Felix Wade is gay?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.417
Thank you, ma'am!

25:46.500 --> 25:48.333
Jonah, even more women
are stepping forward

25:48.417 --> 25:49.750
to say they never dated you.

25:49.834 --> 25:51.667
The NotMe hashtag,
blowin' up big-time.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.208
It's a goddamn movement.

25:53.291 --> 25:55.542
Richard:
The good news is,
our approval rating

25:55.625 --> 25:57.291
in New Hampshire
is skyrocketing.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.959
Wait, hold that thought.
It's upside-down.

26:00.041 --> 26:01.875
Maybe we should reopen
the Iowa office.

26:01.959 --> 26:04.000
- Jonah: Let's not do that.
- Reporter: Congressman Ryan!

26:04.083 --> 26:05.834
Thousands of women
have joined #NotMe

26:05.917 --> 26:07.500
to say they've never dated you
and never will.

26:07.583 --> 26:09.250
Thousands of
unattractive  women.

26:09.333 --> 26:12.000
- Mrs. Ryan, any comment?
- I stand behind these brave,

26:12.083 --> 26:14.750
unattractive women
who have come forward
to say, "Not me."

26:14.834 --> 26:16.917
Once upon a time,
back in high school,

26:17.000 --> 26:18.583
I too did not date Jonah Ryan.

26:18.667 --> 26:21.667
Although I did go out
with his super handsome
cousin Ezra.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.917
It's important to note
they only got to third base.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.375
- Thank you.
- No comment.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.083
Teddy:
Ho ho ho!
Check out Buzzfeed.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.417
Looks like
we're not the only campaign

26:28.500 --> 26:30.417
who farted and had to
throw their pants away.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.291
Selina Meyer just
outed Felix Wade!

26:33.375 --> 26:35.417
Oh. And there's
another hashtag trending.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.250
eWtoN.
No, that's upside-down.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.959
It's still NotMe.

26:39.041 --> 26:40.542
- You should lock
your screen, dude.
- Yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.291
Where is Mike?!

26:43.375 --> 26:45.959
Where is that fat-faced,
freckled fuck-it-up-agus?

26:46.041 --> 26:47.458
Hiding in the bathroom,
ma'am,

26:47.542 --> 26:49.000
making pretend
diarrhea noises.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.125
I just can't believe that
that second-hand Muppet

26:51.208 --> 26:52.917
wrote an article that
people actually read.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.333
Including Felix.
Who, by the way

26:54.417 --> 26:55.959
ma'am, moved you
to table 47

26:56.041 --> 26:57.458
along with his driver
and his daughter.

26:57.542 --> 26:59.417
Selina:
Oh. OK, well,

26:59.500 --> 27:01.750
I guess I need to go
and congratulate him now.

27:01.834 --> 27:04.542
I'm gonna choke him
with that giant cock of his,

27:04.625 --> 27:06.125
- see how he  likes it.
- Ahh.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.000
Selina: Ahem.

27:08.083 --> 27:10.291
- Hi there, Tom!
- Hey.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.417
I heard you had
a very busy afternoon

27:12.500 --> 27:14.250
working your staff
to the bone.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.834
I'd ask what you did
this afternoon,

27:15.917 --> 27:18.000
but I think
I read something
about that.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.291
( laughing )

27:19.375 --> 27:21.750
Did Mrs. James send you
to chaperone?

27:21.834 --> 27:23.166
- Oh, come--
- Me?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.125
Because back in
our old Senate days,

27:25.208 --> 27:28.458
this one here
had a real thing
for blond hill rats

27:28.542 --> 27:32.000
in Nine West pumps
desperate to fuck their way
to the middle.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.458
- Oh, boy.
- But that was
a long time ago, so...

27:34.542 --> 27:37.333
You know what I'd love
is a spicy mescal margarita

27:37.417 --> 27:38.959
with light agave
and heavy salt.

27:40.917 --> 27:42.667
What are you looking
at him for?

27:42.750 --> 27:46.000
Ma'am, I'm the Senator's
Deputy Chief of Staff.

27:46.083 --> 27:49.041
Congratulations.
Then you probably
won't fuck it up.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.375
( softly ) OK.

27:53.458 --> 27:56.125
- ( Michelle groans )
- Watch where you're goin'!

27:56.208 --> 27:57.709
- Sorry, Madam President.
- Uh-huh.

27:57.792 --> 28:00.375
- Light agave. Yes.
- Yes, Madam President.

28:00.458 --> 28:06.250
God, I feel so sorry for
whoever's stickin' their dick
in that bag of mayonnaise.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.125
- I'm gonna go find my seat.
- Yeah.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.792
Well, give my regards
to Felix and his checkbook.

28:10.875 --> 28:14.792
Sadly, I am not the recipient
of Mr. Wade's munificence.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.375
Wha--

28:16.458 --> 28:19.458
Well, he sure as shit
didn't pick me.

28:19.542 --> 28:21.709
- Oh, did he?
- Felix: Have you met
Senator Talbot?

28:21.792 --> 28:25.333
I like to say
she's the future of the party.
I mean, look at her!

28:25.417 --> 28:27.375
Fuck me in the Aspen.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.291
She's running for president?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.125
I don't know what she is,
but it's great.

28:31.208 --> 28:32.875
- It's great. So exciting.
- Kemi: It is great.

28:32.959 --> 28:34.750
- So exciting.
- So exciting.

28:34.834 --> 28:38.375
The tri-racial twat
stabbed me in the back!

28:38.458 --> 28:40.542
She really is
your protégée.

28:41.709 --> 28:44.250
I'll see
ya on the trail.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.375
Richard:
It's so nice
to be back home in Iowa.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.959
Place is a dump.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.291
New polls from New Hampshire.
Seems you just left yesterday,

28:50.375 --> 28:51.834
but your numbers
are already way up.

28:51.917 --> 28:53.750
- Jonah: Yeah?
- Oh, wait. Actually--

28:53.834 --> 28:55.291
- That's right, way up.
- Oh, nice.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.375
Maybe I should just
stop campaigning altogether.

28:57.458 --> 28:58.500
Couldn't hurt.

28:58.583 --> 29:00.083
There are
some more boxes in the car.

29:00.166 --> 29:02.000
- Will you go grab those?
- Yeah, I'm happy to.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.625
Oh, remember,
lift with your back.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.125
It's your legs.
L-Legs.

29:05.208 --> 29:06.333
No, you lift with your back.

29:06.417 --> 29:08.542
- Oh. That's incorrect.
- OK, well.

29:08.625 --> 29:11.333
That could probably
be the main cause
of your scoliosis.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.750
I have scoliosis?

29:12.834 --> 29:14.083
Oh, yes.
Clearly.
