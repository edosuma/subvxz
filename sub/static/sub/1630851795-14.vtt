<i> [narrator] this time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:09.708
[digger] look what I found.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.277
Got one of these ultrasonic
cleaning machines.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.212
Maybe it'll work
with aging liquor.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.147
Finish in 30 minutes,
if it works.

00:15.149 --> 00:18.884
This could change
the whole industry
as we know it.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.386
Might be a little
cloudy, though.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.387
Damn it.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.022
[mike] we're going to make
jalapeno cornbread.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.490
Man, are you serious?

00:24.492 --> 00:26.959
We're just gonna
crumble them up,
put them in the barrel.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.494
I think we'll have
a damn good run of liquor.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.029
[mike] take a swig.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.897
[sputtering]

00:31.899 --> 00:33.065

00:33.067 --> 00:35.034
<i> [man on phone] oh, yeah.</i>
<i>  That was the premier dessert.</i>

00:35.036 --> 00:36.835
We're gonna make
a bananas foster liquor.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.171
<i>  We got our bananas,</i>
<i>  our butter, brown sugar.</i>

00:39.173 --> 00:42.374
The only thing that we stand
to lose is our reputation.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.578
<i> [man] this is how we make</i>
<i>  the moonshine.</i>

00:50.751 --> 00:52.384
[mark] I ain't doubting it.

00:52.953 --> 00:57.322
But you say you've got
a notion about how we can age
this in two months or less.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.957
You're gonna call me crazy.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.993
Well, that ain't nothing new.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.261
I'm gonna put it
on a ufo.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.797

<i> [narrator] in cocke county,</i>

<i>  for a client who needs it</i>

01:14.041 --> 01:15.974
We're at the point
now in our life,

01:15.976 --> 01:17.810
this is what we enjoy doing.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.011
<i>  We like small batch.</i>

01:19.013 --> 01:21.914
You can pay more
attention to detail
with a smaller batch.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.715
<i>  Plus, you know, if it brings</i>
<i>  bigger money</i>

01:23.717 --> 01:26.618
and you get a premium price
for a little bit less liquor,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.121
why wouldn't you make
more money off less work?

01:29.123 --> 01:30.856
What we catching?
Six, you say?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.124
We're on number six.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.593
<i> [mark] small batch,</i>
<i>  specialty liquors.</i>

01:34.595 --> 01:37.796
<i>  We hope this is what we get</i>
<i>  to do more of in the future.</i>

01:37.798 --> 01:40.165
But we've promised this liquor
in two months.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.367
<i> You know, that's a tall order.</i>

01:42.369 --> 01:44.970
Do you remember them guns
that we needed clean?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.472
[mark] uh-huh?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.574
Remember that big tub I had
to put that cleaning solution,

01:48.576 --> 01:50.209
that ultrasonic
cleaning machine?

01:50.211 --> 01:54.046
Well, I read a little article
about ultrasonic aging.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.082
You know, I've got
one of these ultrasonic
cleaning machines.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.150
I don't use it much.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.885
<i>  It causes vibrations,</i>

01:59.887 --> 02:03.822
so anything that gets debris
embedded in small crevices,

02:03.824 --> 02:05.591
this is supposed
to bring it out.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.427
So, maybe it'll work with
aging liquor and some chips.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.063
I got one of them
toothbrushes, ultrasonic.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.564
Yeah, same principle.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.899
If it vibrates
everything loose,

02:13.901 --> 02:17.035
it's gonna vibrate
them tannins and flavors
loose, too.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.972
Well, I see that that's got
good potential of working.

02:19.974 --> 02:23.108
Tell you how we can
do 100 gallon at a time?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.476
Buy 50 of them toothbrushes.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.612
-No.
-[chuckles]

02:26.614 --> 02:31.150
put one of them things
like they vibrate concrete
down around foundations with.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.751
Yeah, but they gotta have
an air compressor.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.920
Hell, we've got
an air compressor.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.589
Not a big ingersoll rand,
great big one
that's diesel powered.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.025
Okay, that's a bad idea, mark.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.829
I'm sorry that I come up
with something
and you shot it all to hell.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.031
I'll give him the benefit
of the doubt,

02:46.033 --> 02:48.534
but he shoots my idea
down immediately,

02:48.536 --> 02:50.769
before he hadn't even
thought about it,

02:50.771 --> 02:53.939
and I think maybe it's just
because he hasn't went
that far in his thinking.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.775
God, you're so temperamental!

02:56.777 --> 03:00.212
He's gotta simmer down.
He's getting too cantankerous
in his older years.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.881
How do you feel about a little
hormone replacement therapy?

03:02.883 --> 03:05.584
-How do you feel like
the piss slapped out of you?
-[chuckling]

03:05.586 --> 03:08.053
[mark] if you keep
on laughing, kick you
in your damn ovaries.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.688
[both laughing]

03:09.690 --> 03:11.290
[mark] ultrasonic aging.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.892
There ain't nobody
in the moonshining
circle doing it.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.727
[digger] no.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.031
If this ultrasonic machine
works, we can't do large
quantities at a time,

03:19.033 --> 03:23.001
but on small runs,
this will be a game changer.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.770
<i> [digger] we got almost</i>
<i>  seven-and-a-half gallons</i>
<i>  out of this,</i>

03:24.772 --> 03:26.505
<i>  so this isn't a bad run.</i>

03:26.507 --> 03:30.175
This is a high-end client
that we very well could
get some further sales out of.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.845
So, we get it done fast,
we can turn that
into dollars quicker.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.348
Alcohol and tasty alcohol.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.619
So we'll put dr. Digger's
ultrasonic theory to test.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.733
Yo! Come on, buddy.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.834
-[jerry] what's up, bud?
-[mike] what's going on?

03:55.836 --> 03:58.170
-All right. How was the trip?
-Good.

03:58.172 --> 04:03.842
<i> [narrator] in sevier county,</i>

<i>  in an attempt to</i>
<i>  reboot their season.</i>

04:08.816 --> 04:09.948
It's getting late
in the season.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.617
The leaves are starting
to turn.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.985
<i>  You know, we gotta</i>
<i>  make some money.</i>

04:12.987 --> 04:14.586
<i>  We got a new still site.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:16.955
We're not trying to make
big volumes of alcohol here.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.158
We want to make top-shelf
high-dollar premium alcohol.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.127
That's our goal
for this season.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.663
You know, less alcohol,
but for a higher price.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.231
I got some sugar
and some grain.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.133
Got some rye this time.
What do you think about that?

04:28.135 --> 04:30.535
Definitely ready to mash in,
that's for sure.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.038
But I don't know.
I think I want to do
a little something different.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.974
Me and jerry,
we're the guys that step
outside of the box

04:35.976 --> 04:38.944
to try to create
something new, different,
something good.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.245
Come over here.
I want to show you.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.048
We're gonna make
jalapeno cornbread.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.950
Man, are you serious?

04:44.952 --> 04:48.086
Everybody out there
in the world is making liquor
out of all kinds of stuff.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.988
There's a lot of people
out there that's like me.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.858
They like different,
they like some heat and stuff.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.761
<i>  People make liquor</i>
<i>  out of all kind</i>
<i>  of stuff these days.</i>

04:55.763 --> 04:57.863
Why not do it out
of jalapeno cornbread?

04:57.865 --> 04:59.131
<i> It sounds like a winner to me.</i>

04:59.133 --> 05:00.599
You know how
I am with spicy stuff.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.334
Just try it.

05:02.336 --> 05:05.170
<i>  You know, if we're selling</i>
<i>  something out there that</i>
<i>  no one else has for sale,</i>

05:05.172 --> 05:06.571
we're ahead of the ball then.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.573
-What do you think?
-Uh!

05:08.575 --> 05:10.075
[mike] what is it?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.276
Hot almighty!

05:11.278 --> 05:13.278
How the hell can
you eat that stuff?

05:13.280 --> 05:15.380
[cackles] what do you
think, though?

05:15.382 --> 05:16.415
I mean--

05:16.417 --> 05:18.717
I couldn't taste
the cornbread
for the hot spicy.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.619
You can't tell me that's
too damn hot for you.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.788
You know, jerry's a big,
old boy now,

05:22.790 --> 05:25.290
but when it comes to
a pepper something,
he's a damn crybaby.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.794
I mean, he can look at
damn black pepper in a shaker
and go to sweating.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.828
I don't know how
you do it, man.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.763
You know, when I eat something
like a jalapeno,

05:31.765 --> 05:36.735
the sensation I get is
like somebody's stuck a
red-hot poker in my mouth.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.603
Why would anybody want that
in their food or moonshine?

05:38.605 --> 05:41.673
[cackles] what the hell's
wrong with you, jerry?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.308
My question is
what the hell
is wrong with you?

05:43.310 --> 05:45.243
All right, now, look.
There's the difference.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.045
Our taste profiles
are different.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.980
But there's a lot of people
out there in the world

05:48.982 --> 05:51.049
that love this stuff
just like I do.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.018
I stand to make
a hell of a lot more money

05:53.020 --> 05:55.020
on something different
like that.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.922
You think we sell that
for more money than
we can our rye?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.190
Absolutely.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.659
I don't even know
how you'd even mash in
jalapeno cornbread.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.795
Make jalapeno cornbread,
just like right over there,

06:03.797 --> 06:07.699
crumble it up,
mash it in just like
you would corn liquor.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.267
You know, that ain't
gonna work.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.539
-Why?
-We can't put them jalapenos
in our wooden barrels, too.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.274
Oh, [bleep].

06:16.276 --> 06:17.943
Jalapenos is a different
kind of flavor.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.947
That spicy power it's got,
you get that in that wood,
you're never getting it out.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.982
It'll be in the taste
of everything we do
from now on.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.817
By god, that would happen.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.955
We gotta find a way, I guess,
to post-flavor the cornbread
liquor after the fact.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.189
Well, I do like
the sound of that,

06:31.191 --> 06:33.191
'cause that way we can control
how hot it is.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.760
The only way we can
make this happen is

06:34.762 --> 06:37.295
we're gonna have
to actually mash in
this cornbread,

06:37.297 --> 06:38.263
and we'll have
to post-flavor it.

06:38.265 --> 06:41.400
Cornbread mashed without
the jalapenos at first.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.834
We'll flavor it
after the fact.

06:42.836 --> 06:46.171
You know, that way
we got control of how much
spice goes into every jar.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.273
So you're thinking
jalapeno cornbread

06:48.275 --> 06:49.708
we can sell for more
than our rye?

06:49.710 --> 06:50.842
Absolutely.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.178
You know, I'm willing
to give it a shot.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.646
Trust me on this, man!

06:54.648 --> 06:56.815
My man, jerry's just gotta
bake all this cornbread,

06:56.817 --> 06:58.917
so we can get it to the woods
and get her mashed in.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.118
<i>  We're gonna make</i>
<i>  this thing happen.</i>

07:00.120 --> 07:01.853
<i>  He's gonna be</i>
<i>  surprised at the end.</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:03.321
<i>  We're gonna do it.</i>
<i>  Let's make some cornbread.</i>

07:18.172 --> 07:19.671

<i>  the absinthe is unbelievable.</i>

07:19.673 --> 07:21.039
<i>  It's going amazing, man.</i>

-[man on phone]
<i>  oh, everybody do.</i>

07:24.211 --> 07:26.845

07:36.824 --> 07:38.089
Let's do a bananas foster.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.825
I remember that
from back in the day.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.861
<i> [man on phone] oh, yeah.</i>
<i>  That was the premier dessert.</i>

07:42.863 --> 07:45.096
<i>  And they said, "if you were</i>

<i>  you were in a four,</i>
<i>  five-star restaurant."</i>

07:47.234 --> 07:49.901
<i>  okay, well,</i>
<i>  the chef wants three gallons.</i>

07:49.903 --> 07:51.603
<i>  If you don't mind,</i>
<i>  I'll take two.</i>

07:51.605 --> 07:52.904
All right, I can do that.

This guy tells us that
a chef wants our alcohol.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.976
<i>  I mean, this is new orleans.</i>

07:57.978 --> 07:59.244
<i>  This could be</i>
<i>  a five-star chef.</i>

07:59.246 --> 08:00.912
That's kind of big
right there.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.147

this all entails,

<i>  I appreciate it.</i>

08:04.785 --> 08:07.486
Bananas foster is a real
high-end dessert.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.988
<i>  This is something</i>
<i>  that a chef prepares right</i>
<i>  on the side of the table.</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:13.291
<i>  I mean, it dates back</i>
<i>  to new orleans,</i>
<i>  way back in the 50s.</i>

08:13.293 --> 08:19.030
It was prepared with
unsalted butter, brown sugar,
cinnamon, banana liqueur,

<i>  one banana per person,</i>
<i>  and rum.</i>

08:21.201 --> 08:23.068

Man, this sugar's heavy, man.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.804

That's why.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.341
<i> Today we're at the still site.</i>

08:29.343 --> 08:33.211
We're gonna start our mash in,
we're gonna do a spice rum,
our base spirit.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.181
All right.
That's that light stuff.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.416
-That's the dark guy
right there.
-[craig] that's the dark one.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.785
[richard] when we make rum,
I mean, we always use
brown sugar.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.187
Go ahead and start it.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.025
<i>  Darker brown sugars have more</i>
<i>  molasses sucked into them.</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:48.760
All right.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.197
We don't wanna have too much
of an overpowering presence
of molasses here,

08:52.199 --> 08:54.833
so we're just gonna
use one-third
of the dark brown sugars

08:54.835 --> 08:56.401
as opposed to
the light brown sugar.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.937
I'm gonna drop this
dark brown in here first.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.305
[craig] all right.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.573
[richard] cooking it down
for a little bit.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.241
This is the rich stuff.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.678
-This is what's gonna give
us the deep flavoring--
-[craig] deep caramelization.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.980
[richard] all that complex
stuff going on.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.083
-[craig] we got one
of these light ones.
-[richard] pour this in.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.718
[richard] this is gonna
be delicate.

09:13.720 --> 09:18.123
Tying really well with
that dark brown sugar,
unfiltered cane sugar.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.626
Before we put the heat on,
I just want to stir it
up real good,

09:21.628 --> 09:23.161
make sure nothing's
sticking at the bottom,

09:23.163 --> 09:24.896
'cause we ain't got no way
to get down in there.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.931
[craig chuckles] no.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.198
See what that's looking like.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.068
We'll add our seasoning.
I say seasoning,
but it's our spices.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.871
That boy said we're gonna
put some seasoning,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.272
-like we're cooking.
-[richard chuckles]

09:34.274 --> 09:36.741
I swear, that boy
is so cajun, yeah.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.209
[richard laughs]

09:38.211 --> 09:41.279
spice in louisiana,
that's something that
definitely doesn't scare us.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.449
<i>  This is cloves, nutmeg,</i>
<i>  black peppercorn,</i>
<i>  cinnamon sticks.</i>

09:44.451 --> 09:45.917
<i>  And that's all</i>
<i>  we're gonna need.</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:46.818
Oh, yeah.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.953
All right, let's light it up.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.087
[craig] let's light it.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.355
[richard] that's good.

09:50.891 --> 09:54.225
Gonna boil this,
let it sit,

09:54.227 --> 09:56.928
and then we'll pitch the yeast
when it gets to
a good temperature.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.064
[craig] I can smell that
working already.
Just heating up.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.100
Oh, yeah. It's got
a hint of spice to it.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.069
But, I mean, this smells
real good.

10:04.071 --> 10:08.239
That brown sugar stands out
big time in this right here.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.242
Immediately, you can
smell just candy.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.844
Gonna kill this fire.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.113
And we're gonna add
a little bit more water to it.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.182
<i>  I'm anxious to let</i>
<i>  this cool down,</i>

10:17.184 --> 10:19.017
'cause it smells awesome.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.821
I mean, it smells like
you're actually cooking
something right now.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.722
That's pretty much it.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.689
[craig] that's it.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.093
[richard] so this is cooled
down enough, man.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.060
We could pitch this yeast.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.596
Look how pretty that is.

10:31.598 --> 10:35.133
I like a yeast that'll
fall like a grain of sand.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.469
I'm gonna give that
a good stir right there.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.207
This molasses has
so much of everything
a yeast would need.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.242
It even has
a mineral content to it.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.611
We should get a real strong
alcohol out of this.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.246
[craig] old, trusty cap, so...

10:48.248 --> 10:50.582
-That's all we need.
-[craig] that's all we need
right there.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.283
Ready to go.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.184
[richard] she's ready to go.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.886
We got everything mashed in.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.121
<i>  We'll let it sit</i>
<i>  for a couple of days,</i>

10:56.123 --> 10:57.689
come back
and get ready to run.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.258
All right, cool. Come on.
Let's get out of here, man.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.339
<i> [mark] I don't know what</i>
<i>  you've got in mind.</i>

11:14.341 --> 11:16.141
<i>  Ages in two months.</i>

11:16.143 --> 11:17.542
[digger] we could finish
in 30 minutes

11:17.544 --> 11:19.044
with this ultrasonic machine
if it worked.

11:19.046 --> 11:23.214
We've been asked for six
gallons of barrel-finished
rye whiskey.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.784
<i>  That's not</i>
<i>  a far-fetched request,</i>

11:25.786 --> 11:27.252
other than he wants it
in two months.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.187
We don't have a lot of room
to mess up here.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.624
We did make
a gallon-and-a-half
more than the order's for.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.592
We don't screw it up,
that's mine and yours.

11:34.594 --> 11:38.129
But you don't have a clue
if this works or it don't.

11:38.131 --> 11:38.863
Not an inkling.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.832
Go find it. Good luck.

11:40.834 --> 11:44.402
You know, two months is a big
ask for a barrel-finished rye.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.105
But I've got this
ultrasonic cleaning machine.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.840
I know it's here somewhere.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.041
Look what I found.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.577
<i>  So we'll see what</i>
<i>  the ultrasonic aging does</i>

11:52.579 --> 11:54.145
<i>  to liquor with some</i>
<i>  wood chips in it.</i>

11:54.147 --> 11:58.550
If this works,
we have revolutionized
the rapid aging world.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.193
[mark] I just don't understand
how this ultrasonic
machine works.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.562
[digger] well,
we're going to try.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.030
Ah.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.100
<i> [mark] you know, never, ever</i>
<i>  would we promise</i>

12:15.102 --> 12:17.902
six gallons of barrel-finished
whiskey in two months.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.806
But digger has an idea
about ultrasonic aging.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.709
Are we gonna
leave it in the jars,
dump the liquor in the--

12:24.711 --> 12:26.211
no, I'm not gonna dump
that liquor in there.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.414
We'll use water just to get
the sound waves into the jars.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.083
The ultrasonic vibrations
in liquid

12:32.085 --> 12:36.755
<i>  causes the liquid to move</i>
<i>  in and out of crevices</i>
<i>  and pull debris out.</i>

12:36.757 --> 12:38.890
That's what tannins
are in the wood.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.291
It's a debris in there,
if you will.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.993
We're gonna chip
this stuff up.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.195
I'm going to put the barrel
in the liquor.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.998
<i>  I get the chips, we start</i>
<i>  putting them in the jars.</i>

12:47.000 --> 12:50.235
This should make the liquor
move in and out of the chips,

12:50.237 --> 12:52.871
<i>  and get that deep,</i>
<i>  rich mahogany color in there.</i>

12:52.873 --> 12:54.072
We'll see what
it's gonna do.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.273
I can see how it would work.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.175
We'll crank it up this way.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.076
30 minutes.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.545
Makes a slight
racket though, don't it?

13:00.547 --> 13:05.583
If this ultrasonic vibration
with wood chips and liquor
works like I think it will,

13:05.585 --> 13:09.554
then we may be on
to the next big thing in
the liquor finishing world.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.423
Look how it's already changed.
That's the color, look.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.659
[mark] yeah, you can
see that stuff moving
around in there.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.994
How about that?

13:15.996 --> 13:20.165
This could change
the whole industry
as we know it now.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.065
Ain't that something?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.268
It's near dark enough.
Pretty good.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.938
I'm afraid it might be
a little cloudy, though.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.875
We can't have it looking
that way. Damn it.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.011
In the very short period
of time that's passed here,

13:33.013 --> 13:33.978
we're getting color,

13:33.980 --> 13:37.015
but appears that there may be
some dinginess

13:37.017 --> 13:40.985
or a little bit of cloudiness
coming with the color change.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.620
<i>  This is a high-end liquor.</i>

13:42.622 --> 13:43.988
That's a deal breaker.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.294
I'm telling you.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.196
Taste that.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.265
I mean, it's got the taste
of a barrel-finished rye.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.333
Wow.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.268
[digger] but that
clouding's unacceptable.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.603
[mark] no, we can't have that.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.939
We could strain them
chips out there right now,

14:00.941 --> 14:01.840
and I'd be happy with that.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.775
But you can't sell it.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.978
-You can't charge a premium
price for this color.
-You can't for cloudy liquor.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.781
It's as good of a rye
as you'd ever want to taste.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.851
But if I saw it
on the liquor store shelf,
I'd keep going.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.220
This little machine here,
I think, is so efficient.

14:15.222 --> 14:20.592
It's pulling the tannins
and the oils out of those
chips so strong.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.628
-It's doing way more than
natural convection does.
-Right.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.829
This thing's great.

14:24.831 --> 14:28.032
The problem was just,
we didn't clean
the chips enough.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.736
I may have not rinsed
the chips and soaked
them long enough

14:31.738 --> 14:34.339
to really get all the dust
particles out of there.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.075
<i>  I'm gonna soak</i>
<i>  them for 36, 48 hours.</i>

14:37.077 --> 14:38.910
I'm thinking this thing
works so good,

14:38.912 --> 14:41.846
we're going to soak
these chips for
a good 48 hours,

14:41.848 --> 14:43.882
<i>  I'm gonna rinse them</i>
<i>  three or four times,</i>

14:43.884 --> 14:44.716
try it again.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.017
[mark] get them chips soaking.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.152
We'll come back
and try it again.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.401
<i> [mike] you ready to make</i>
<i>  some cornbread, jerry?</i>

15:03.403 --> 15:05.670
Well, I guess I'm ready
for you to show me
how to make cornbread.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.105
You don't know how to?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.274
You know, jerry,
I think you can
make some nuts.

15:09.276 --> 15:14.178
But if people can take
bananas and turn banana
pudding into a drink,

15:14.180 --> 15:17.048
why can't I turn jalapeno
cornbread into a drink?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.217
[jerry] here's
my only question.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.785
What's the advantage
of using cornbread?

15:20.787 --> 15:24.989
You're gonna be able
to taste the crust,
the smoke I'm gonna put in it.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.825
We're gonna have
some smoky,
jalapeno cornbread liquor,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.827
once we're all said and done.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.829
That sounds like that
might be appetizable there.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.765
[mike] oh, yeah,
it's gonna be good.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.067
You tell me you don't know
how to make cornbread.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.236
I'm willing to learn,
if you're willing to show me.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.772
How the hell does
somebody grow up in south

15:40.774 --> 15:42.140
and call himself
a mountain man,

15:42.142 --> 15:44.575
and don't even know
how to make a damn
pone of cornbread?

15:44.577 --> 15:46.811
Just a few simple ingredients
I like to use.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.981
You gotta have your flour,
your sugar and your cornmeal,

15:49.983 --> 15:53.985
and most of all,
some good old homegrown
rooster bullets.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.254
<i>  Hell, the boy</i>
<i>  can't even boil water.</i>

15:56.256 --> 15:59.357
He's always just sitting
on the couch and letting
mama bring it to him.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.125
So, here's ol' dad.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.127
I'll do the cooking too,
I reckon.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.229
I wanna do 20 pones
of cornbread.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.198
-Pond?
-Pone.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.566
What the hell's a "pone"?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.201
It's a pone, like a--

16:10.470 --> 16:11.869
a pan?

16:12.105 --> 16:14.973
It's made in a pan,
but we call it a pone
of cornbread, you know.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.107
Pone bread.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.008
What part of the world
they talk like that?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.109
Mississippi.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.445
-Okay.
That explains everything.
-[mike] all right.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.114
<i> [mike] jerry, he don't even</i>
<i>  know what the damn</i>
<i>  word "pone" means.</i>

16:23.116 --> 16:25.850
I'm like, "damn, son.
You ain't never heard
of a pone before?"

16:25.852 --> 16:27.051
-it's a pone.
-[jerry] oh, a pone.

16:27.053 --> 16:27.952
[mike] a pone of cornbread.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.821
Add a little bit of mustard.

16:29.823 --> 16:34.759
<i>  In the south, we always</i>
<i>  put a little mustard</i>
<i>  on a lot of stuff.</i>

16:34.761 --> 16:40.865
So a little bit
of the secret ingredient,
my house-blend seasoning.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.067
This special recipe
with the cornbread
that I'm making,

16:43.069 --> 16:46.037
it's come down from my mom
and my grandmother.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.407
I'm gonna try to replicate
that and do it as close
as I can.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.775
I've got my skillets greased,

16:50.777 --> 16:53.411
little liquid butter until
that gets hot enough

16:53.413 --> 16:55.913
to start frying
the bottom of the cornbread.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.950
<i>  I pour my batter in here,</i>
<i>  let that cook on</i>
<i>  the bottom a little bit,</i>

16:58.952 --> 17:01.819
<i>  let it start bubbling</i>
<i>  and crisping up</i>
<i>  around the edges.</i>

17:01.821 --> 17:05.123
<i> Then I'll take it and transfer</i>
<i>  it over to the pellet smoker.</i>

17:05.125 --> 17:08.259
<i>  That's where we'll finish</i>
<i>  the process of baking</i>
<i>  the cornbread.</i>

17:09.396 --> 17:10.995
That a good smoked
cornbread there.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.030
[mike] yeah, buddy.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.232
<i> You can't go wrong with smoke.</i>

17:14.234 --> 17:17.068
There's a difference between
a bag of cornmeal

17:17.070 --> 17:18.936
and some good old
baked cornbread.

17:18.938 --> 17:22.273
<i>  All your seasonings,</i>
<i>  your butter,</i>
<i>  your little bit of sugar.</i>

17:22.275 --> 17:24.876
<i>  And then of course,</i>
<i>  you're gonna use</i>
<i>  a cast iron skillet</i>

17:24.878 --> 17:28.012
that's made nothing
but cornbread
for almost 100 years.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.248
See how pretty that pone is.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.115
[jerry] that's a pone
of cornbread.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.583
And there's just
nothing like it.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.585
Put a little of this
melty butter on there.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.155
See how that tastes.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.058
It's gonna be hot now.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.259
[chuckles] damn it.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.162
Mmm.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.898
Tastes like good cornbread,
don't it?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.233
Yeah, if we can get
that flavor right there
in some alcohol,

17:49.235 --> 17:50.968
I'll be impressed.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.537
Gonna be good.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.039
[jerry] that crunchy crust
on the bottom has got a whole
different unique flavor.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.141
A whole different taste.
That's what I'm talking about,
that right there.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.677
I can actually taste
a little bit of the smoky
flavor in that, too.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.678
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.015
<i>  This cornbread is out</i>
<i>  of damn world good.</i>

18:04.017 --> 18:05.950
<i>  We gonna need at least</i>
<i>  20 pones of cornbread,</i>

18:05.952 --> 18:07.618
<i>  so that's a lot of cooking.</i>

18:07.620 --> 18:09.921
And then we got to get it
to the woods and get it
all mashed in.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.355
There we go.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.937
<i> [richard] oh, look.</i>
<i>  We got a little</i>
<i>  baby alligator right here.</i>

18:25.939 --> 18:27.939
It's looking at us, man,
like it's hungry.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.740
<i> [craig] you know,</i>
<i>  I want to eat him.</i>

18:29.742 --> 18:31.175
So we're back
at the still site today.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.210
We're gonna check on our mash.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.611
<i>  This is our spice rum,</i>

18:33.613 --> 18:36.013
our base spirit
for our banana foster.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.015
Oh, yeah.
That black peppercorn, man.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.118
I can smell that in there
really good right now.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.854
It sucked up a lot
of that molasses
that yeast went after,

18:42.856 --> 18:44.922
and it came back out
in the alcohol.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.023
Definitely some
high-proof stuff,

18:46.025 --> 18:48.292
and that's what we need
for where we're going next.

18:48.294 --> 18:52.396
We're gonna take this liquor
and we're gonna marry it
into another banana liquor,

18:52.398 --> 18:55.900
that we're gonna pay
just as much attention to
and put just as much love in.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.401
That's gonna keep
a consistent flavor

18:57.403 --> 18:59.070
all the way
through the process, man.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.204
[craig] let's run this.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.307
Be a litlle bit more humble.

19:04.077 --> 19:07.011
A chef wants our alcohol.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.779
<i> [craig] the captain, his rum,</i>

19:08.781 --> 19:10.281
he's not giving it
to you till it's good.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.884
<i> [richard] we don't wanna</i>
<i>  just fly this one</i>
<i>  over the coupe,</i>

19:12.886 --> 19:14.085
<i>  just because no one else</i>
<i>  has done it.</i>

19:14.087 --> 19:15.319
<i>  We want to do this right.</i>

19:15.321 --> 19:17.788
We're gonna give him
a run for his money.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.257
He's gonna be surprised.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.960
It's getting real hot.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.163
We should be running
anytime now.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.267
[craig] yeah,
she's running now.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.768
[richard] come on.
We're starting to run?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.770
Oh, yeah. There she goes.

19:32.772 --> 19:33.971
That's a pretty little stream.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.973
[craig] I can smell
all that spice
coming out of there.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.943
I knew that peppercorn
was gonna do something good
'cause I smell it.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.012
I smell a little
cinnamon up here.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.880
Yeah, that cinnamon
is coming through, too.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.881
And that nutmeg, man.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.949
All right.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.185
I'm gonna take off these
heads real quick, man.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.187
-All right.
-That's heads.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.330
Is it cool?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.464
Is it hot?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.868
Hot damn, man.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.169
Yeah, it's hot.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.204
-A little spicy--
-[craig] that' what
we wanted though.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.738
Yeah, we wanted some spice.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.907
<i>  Now that we have our base</i>
<i>  spirit to start off with,</i>

20:09.909 --> 20:11.742
we gotta go ahead
and fine tune our recipe.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.910
Come on.
Let's get out of here, man.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.312
[craig] we gotta get
some bananas.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.013
[richard] yeah, we gotta
get all kinds of stuff.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.188
[mark] well, I have faith.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.957
[digger] I have got faith.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.993
The first attempt at
this ultrasonic aging
of whiskey

20:28.995 --> 20:30.595
turned out very cloudy.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.263
That clouding's unacceptable.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.664
Well, we'll fix it.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.333
So we're gonna try again.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.802
These chips here,
how long have you
been soaking them?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.904
[digger] they've been
on 48 hours.

20:39.906 --> 20:44.075
On our first try,
we just soaked the chips
for a couple of hours.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.211
<i>  This time, I've soaked</i>
<i>  the chips for about 48 hours,</i>

20:47.213 --> 20:51.249
and we're putting them
in cheesecloth to
limit their movement.

20:51.251 --> 20:56.287
<i>  I'm hoping that that will</i>
<i>  prevent any extra tannins</i>
<i>  and particulate coming out.</i>

20:56.289 --> 20:59.023
And hopefully,
it won't cloud this time.

20:59.025 --> 21:03.094
Get us a couple of three jars
of corn liquor and we'll see
what we can do at that.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.395
Yeah, that's a good idea.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.763
We can't mess up
no more of this.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.366
We always have
corn liquor on hand.

21:08.368 --> 21:12.336
We're not gonna take
a chance on clouding up
the rye at this point.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.672
<i> [digger] we don't wanna waste</i>
<i>  our six gallons of liquor.</i>

21:14.674 --> 21:16.374
We're gonna use
some corn liquor.

21:16.376 --> 21:20.411
<i>  We've got an ample supply,</i>
<i>  so we can spare more of it</i>
<i>  than we can this rye.</i>

21:20.413 --> 21:22.079
Get that boy running.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.583
It's moving them around.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.852
This works, puss,
we're golden.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.087
-If it don't then...
-We are in a pickle.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.756
We got a sale on the line,

21:31.758 --> 21:33.791
and we need to get this liquor
out the door.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.826
We'll keep
our fingers crossed
this is gonna work.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.462
Let's go get us a sandwich
and then come back.

21:49.042 --> 21:53.911
<i> [mike] now, we gonna get this</i>
<i>  doggone stuff crumbled up,</i>
<i>  make some cornbread liquor.</i>

21:53.913 --> 21:55.980
<i>  We even got our pones</i>
<i>  of cornbread done.</i>

21:55.982 --> 21:58.115
<i>  We got them smoked,</i>
<i>  cooked, baked.</i>

21:58.117 --> 22:00.217
We're ready to go mash
these things in.

22:01.854 --> 22:02.720
Heck yes.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.288
That's a good clean barrel.

22:04.290 --> 22:08.926
Let's get this stuff out here,
and start crumbling it up.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.294
What do you think?

22:10.296 --> 22:12.997
Well, this is a pone
of cornbread,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.899
and this is what
we're mashing in.

22:14.901 --> 22:18.235
We're just hoping
to bring this flavor out
of this cornbread

22:18.237 --> 22:19.837
into a clear jar of liquor.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.072
And then sooner or later,

22:21.074 --> 22:24.842
of course, infuse it
with a little bit
of jalapeno flavor.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.311
It's going to taste a whole
lot different than
regular corn shine.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.146
It's gonna be good, my bud.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.981
We're just gonna
crumble them up,

22:31.184 --> 22:32.783
<i>  put them in the barrel,</i>

22:32.785 --> 22:35.019
<i>  stir them in with</i>
<i>  hot water and sugar,</i>

22:35.021 --> 22:37.021
<i>  fill it up, yeast it in,</i>

22:37.023 --> 22:38.923
and hope it does its thing.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.258
I can't wait to see
what it's gonna taste like.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.793
I'm hoping it's gonna
taste like cornbread.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.095
It should.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.931
-We got enough of it in here,
don't we?
-[jerry] we sure do.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.099
[mike] get some water going.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.166
Get it in a bucket.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.203
Shall I go ahead and light up?

22:52.372 --> 22:54.004
Yeah. We'll go ahead
and strike a fire under it.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.306
Let it be warming up.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.176
-[mike] yeah, buddy.
-[jerry] oh, yeah!

22:59.178 --> 23:00.745
<i> [mike] we're heating</i>
<i>  some water up.</i>

23:00.747 --> 23:01.912
<i> [jerry] let it kinda</i>
<i>  steep in a little bit.</i>

23:01.914 --> 23:04.148
[mike] let it steep in
somewhat.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.921
As soon as the hot water hits
this crumbled up cornbread,

23:10.923 --> 23:13.591
it starts steaming up
in your face,

23:13.593 --> 23:15.159
that's all you can smell.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.595
It's just
cornbread, literally.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.829
[jerry] I'm gonna tell you
what right now.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.998
It's smelling awful
doggone good.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.567
Taste comes out
as good as the aromas
are coming out,

23:23.569 --> 23:25.035
we'll be in good shape.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.371
<i> [mike] we're mashing it in</i>
<i>  in this white oak</i>
<i>  charred barrel.</i>

23:27.373 --> 23:30.141
We believe that this american
white oak charred barrel

23:30.143 --> 23:33.677
is going to add a little
more depth of flavor
into the cornbread.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.346
You know, give it
that charred flavor.

23:35.348 --> 23:38.649
I just believe it's gonna
give it that little extra
help that we need.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.218
All right, we'll lay
the sugar to it.

23:41.220 --> 23:46.991
I mean, it smells just like
granny baking cornbread
with the kitchen window open,

23:46.993 --> 23:48.859
<i>  with the wind blowing</i>
<i>  in the evening.</i>

23:48.861 --> 23:50.895
Man, this stuff is going
all through the woods.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.196
It smells so delicious.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.130
This is your idea.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.331
I'll let you sauce it up here.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.400
I'll sauce it up, brother.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.569
I don't mind one bit.

23:58.571 --> 24:01.839
<i>  Now, all we've got to do</i>
<i>  is just pitch our yeast</i>
<i>  and let this stuff work off,</i>

24:01.841 --> 24:05.609
and come back
in here in a few days
and get ready to run it off.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.278
I say that ought
to do its thing.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.813
Don't you reckon?

24:08.815 --> 24:11.615
Let her layer. Cap her off.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.387
I'm gonna do away with
these old baggy bags here.

24:16.389 --> 24:18.889
Always feels good
to make something
new and exciting.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.191
<i>  You know, something that</i>
<i>  you never done</i>

24:20.193 --> 24:23.093
<i>  because you got something</i>
<i>  to look forward to.</i>

24:23.095 --> 24:25.963
The what-if's
and, "if it don't
turn out right,"

24:25.965 --> 24:29.600
or, "you may strike gold
on this particular recipe."

24:29.602 --> 24:32.069
that's what I get excited
about is doing something new.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.404
Let them burn up a minute.

24:33.406 --> 24:35.072
We'll get the heck
out of here.

24:45.451 --> 24:48.986
[mark] hopefully,
we got some beautiful
golden brown liquor.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.287
[digger] let's look at it.

24:50.289 --> 24:54.058
Digger and I, we left
these jars to ultrasonic
age on their own.

24:54.060 --> 24:59.230
Hopefully, we're going to come
back to three pretty aged,
clear jars of corn liquor.

24:59.232 --> 25:01.265
<i>  Then, we'll move back</i>
<i>  to the rye.</i>

25:03.836 --> 25:05.269
That ain't gonna count, puss.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.203
[digger] no good.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.805
<i>  It's a bust again.</i>

25:07.807 --> 25:10.975
It's clouded up probably worse
than it was the first time.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.844
-[mark] oh, yeah.
Look at that crap in there.
-[digger] yeah.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.679
[digger] looks like somebody
walked through a pond.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.215
<i>  It looks like mud</i>
<i>  floating around in there.</i>

25:18.217 --> 25:21.986
It's supposed to be
crystal clear with nothing
floating around in there.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.053
[mark] it's too cloudy.

25:23.055 --> 25:23.921
Damn it.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.290
Man, I had a lot of faith
in this thing.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.727
It's gotta be shaking
too much of that dust
out of these chips.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.228
Well, we've been soaking them.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.398
-I mean--
-maybe the glass
magnifies the vibrations.

25:35.501 --> 25:36.834
What are you saying?

25:36.903 --> 25:40.070
This glass may be acting
like a reed on a saxophone
or something.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.774
It's making the vibration
louder in there.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.577
Well, we've done it
two times in jars.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.379
Let's eliminate the glass.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.981
And put it right in here?

25:50.983 --> 25:51.982
Direct.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.319
Digger makes a suggestion
that we just pour liquor

25:55.321 --> 25:58.822
in the basin of the ultrasonic
machine itself.

25:58.824 --> 26:02.192
Pour the liquor straight
in there and put the chips
in it and let it go.

26:02.194 --> 26:06.096
-Okay.
-Get this rascal emptied out,
and I'll get that corn liquor.

26:06.098 --> 26:09.767
My theory is, maybe these jars
are acting like your eardrum.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.969
<i>  Maybe the glass is acting</i>
<i>  like an amplifier,</i>

26:11.971 --> 26:16.073
and the sound waves
are actually getting
stronger inside the jar.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.142
<i> [mark] maybe this</i>
<i>  is the solution,</i>
<i>  maybe it's not.</i>

26:18.144 --> 26:20.511
But we're fixing to find out.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.223
-So what are we doing
here today, man?
-[richard] we're gonna cook.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.758
So today, we're at
the still site

26:34.760 --> 26:36.427
and we're gonna
make a bananas foster.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.796
<i>  I figured the best way</i>
<i>  to tackle this monster</i>

26:38.798 --> 26:41.999
is to get our taste designed
around it and acclimate
our palate to it.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.801
We got some banana liqueur.

26:43.803 --> 26:47.171
New orleans, that's a big,
big market to be dealing with.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.073
I don't wanna have to let
down a client in new orleans.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.574
We got some ice cream.

26:50.576 --> 26:53.577
The number one thing
that we stand to lose
is our reputation.

26:53.579 --> 26:56.380
You know, someone having
the ability to say
they couldn't do it.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.816
We got our bananas,
our butter, brown sugar.

26:58.818 --> 26:59.783
We're ready to go.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.352
We're gonna make sure
that we wow this guy.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.687
I'm gonna get
this pan nice and hot.

27:03.689 --> 27:06.724
[craig] why are we not going
to a restaurant or something
and eat this, man?

27:06.726 --> 27:09.994
I could wrap my head around
an idea by tasting it
from somebody else,

27:09.996 --> 27:12.262
but when I do it,
I can wrap myself
all the way around.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.398
So you got light brown,
dark brown and some--

27:14.400 --> 27:16.000
[craig] oh, okay.
I see the dark right there.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.434
[richard] dark brown sugar.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.970
Right now, I need you to take
those bananas and peel them.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.072
We're gonna caramelize
these sugars down.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.208
A nice ratio
of butter and sugar.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.943
[craig] chef homeboy you are.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.945
[chuckles]

27:27.947 --> 27:31.749
[richard] what's cooking is
the alcohol off of this good
rum that we got going on here.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.417
Just need to get
some more banana in.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.853
All these flavors
are merging together.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.221
Got some ice cream.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.657
To be able to enjoy
the ice cream,
and the bananas,

27:39.659 --> 27:43.027
and the caramelized sugar,
and everything else
that's in this,

27:43.029 --> 27:46.563
the love, the attention,
the cinnamon,
the detail, everything.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.132
This looks good.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.134
They got liquor and ice cream.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.239
-How is it?
-[richard] man, that's good.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.509
Really is good.
It's excellent.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.177
Man, you gotta love
your job, right?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.813
But we still have one problem.

28:02.815 --> 28:03.981
What's that?

28:03.983 --> 28:07.084
How do we carry over
all these flavors
into some shine?

28:07.086 --> 28:10.287
We're adding banana,
brown and dark sugars.

28:10.289 --> 28:14.591
Now, this creamy texture,
this buttery stuff that
we taste is another element.

28:14.593 --> 28:19.196
We have to make sure
that our mash covers
every flavor possible.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.098
And some of those
are taboo to us.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.768
Butter and ice cream,
we can't ferment those things,

28:24.770 --> 28:27.671
so we have to make sure
that we represent
these flavors

28:27.673 --> 28:29.973
with something that can
substitute them very well.

28:29.975 --> 28:32.076
There's a couple of different
nuts that we could use

28:32.078 --> 28:35.279
that will replicate
this creamy texture and taste.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.213
[craig] like what?

28:36.215 --> 28:39.349
Walnuts are one of them.
Hazelnuts, almonds.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.853
Now, we gotta figure out
ingredients, the bananas,
the nuts and everything else.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.588
<i>  There's a lot of moving</i>
<i>  parts in this.</i>

28:44.590 --> 28:46.657
This is just the beginning.
We got a long way to go.

28:46.659 --> 28:47.958
Man, that's good.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.627
We're gonna give
this high-end dessert
a high-end liquor appeal

28:50.629 --> 28:52.963
and get a high-end
price tag with it also.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.066
We're gonna give them
a bananas foster in a bottle.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.434
I can't wait
to drink that, boy.

28:57.436 --> 28:58.736
This stuff's good, man.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.636
[craig] I know.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.205
We got a lot of cleaning up
to do here.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.473
Banana foster milkshake.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.475
Where are you going?
I got the keys.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.122
<i> [mike] well, it's a pretty day</i>
<i>  to be in the woods,</i>
<i>  ain't it, jerry?</i>

29:18.124 --> 29:19.323
<i> [jerry] yes, sir.</i>

29:19.658 --> 29:21.825
<i> [mike singing] ♪ fine time</i>
<i>  to run some liquor ♪</i>

29:21.827 --> 29:23.327
<i>  we're on our way</i>
<i>  to the still site.</i>

29:23.329 --> 29:25.629
We're ready to run some
cornbread mash now.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.931
Lookie, there.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.999
[jerry] flat, ain't it?

29:29.001 --> 29:29.600
[mike] yeah, boy.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.903
Mmm.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.938
-Some of that cornbread
taste is there.
-Phew.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.907
I can get me a jar of that.

29:36.909 --> 29:37.741
Let's pump it over, man.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.843
I'm ready to fire
this bad boy up.

29:39.845 --> 29:41.345
<i>  You see the cornbread</i>
<i>  floating in there,</i>

29:41.347 --> 29:41.979
it's worked off.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.847
It's ready to rock and roll.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.116
<i>  We got to just kind</i>
<i>  of pump it over,</i>
<i>  fire this thing up,</i>

29:46.118 --> 29:47.284
and see what we get.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.286
-Drop her in.
-Man, it flies.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.087
<i>  With the end result,</i>

29:50.089 --> 29:52.089
we want to do
a jalapeno cornbread.

29:52.091 --> 29:55.259
So we gotta run this off,
get some good
cornbread liquor,

29:55.261 --> 29:57.661
and then start post-flavoring
our jalapenos.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.096
You know, adding
jalapenos and stuff in,

29:59.098 --> 30:02.032
that's gonna be a whole
another trial there.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.601
Jerry don't seem to be so...

30:04.603 --> 30:05.803
Optimistic about it.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.104
...Optimistic about how the--

30:07.106 --> 30:09.306
damn, we're overflowing.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.108
[jerry] I'm gonna fill
these pellets up.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.415
-[mike] you got it full?
-[jerry] yeah, I got it full.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.251
[mike] all right.
There she flies.

30:21.253 --> 30:24.288
[chuckles] feels good to
be back over here in tennessee

30:24.290 --> 30:26.156
burning this old barrel,
doesn't it?

30:26.158 --> 30:26.790
It burns good.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.091
But one bad thing about it,

30:28.093 --> 30:31.695
I can't stand how long
it takes to heat
this barrel up.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.298
We're going to be here
half the damn night on this.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.465
[jerry] now, we just
hurry up and wait.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.738
Well, we're definitely
moonshining

30:41.740 --> 30:43.173
under the moonlight tonight,
ain't we?

30:43.175 --> 30:46.910
[mike] yee-haw. She's getting
warm right up in here, bro.

30:46.912 --> 30:49.780
[jerry]
get out our money pot there.

30:49.782 --> 30:52.883
What kind of crazy nuthead,
you think's gonna buy
something like this?

30:52.885 --> 30:54.351
Somebody nuts like me.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.153
I hope you're right,

30:56.155 --> 31:00.123
'cause if we ruin
this good liquor with
all that jalapeno spicy junk,

31:00.125 --> 31:01.758
-I'm gonna be upset.
-[chuckles]

31:01.760 --> 31:03.193
come on, man.

31:03.195 --> 31:08.165
You know, there's more
stuff in life than damn
sugar and sweet cakes.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.201
Well, I understand that,
but you ain't got
to hurt to eat.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.103
Well, I don't hurt when I eat.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.172
-I enjoy it.
--So when you cry,
and your face hurts,

31:15.174 --> 31:17.908
-oh, it feels good.
-You kinda gag and carry on,
that ain't hurting?

31:17.910 --> 31:20.878
I love to hurt and burn
like that and cry.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.946
You'll fit perfectly in hell,
won't you?

31:22.948 --> 31:24.748
[bleep] I'll kick
the devil out, son.

31:24.750 --> 31:25.949
[chuckles]

31:25.951 --> 31:28.085
[mike] there we go, baby.
We got liquor.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.286
[jerry] yes, sir.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.755
We get all them tannin
heads out of there.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.223
I bet we'll have a damn
good run of liquor.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.125
We spent damn hours on end.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.094
We started stuff
way before dark,

31:37.096 --> 31:39.296
<i>  but we finally got liquor</i>
<i>  coming out the money spout.</i>

31:39.298 --> 31:40.764
Give the devil his cut.

31:40.766 --> 31:44.468
This stuff is smelling
like damn cornbread
as we're speaking.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.840
[jerry] son,
I'm telling you what.

31:49.842 --> 31:52.976
Little pat of butter, and son,
you'd be on the table.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.711
[mike] oh, my gosh.
That's good stuff.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.280
[jerry] that's
really good, man.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.182
You can taste that crust,
that smoky pecan wood
we put in there.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.684
It's in there, ain't it?

32:00.686 --> 32:04.588
I just gotta figure out
how we're gonna post-flavor
with the jalapenos.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.790
We're gonna have to have
some high-proof alcohol,

32:06.792 --> 32:08.992
break the fibers
and the capsaicin,

32:08.994 --> 32:10.661
and pull all of it
out of the cells.

32:10.663 --> 32:13.030
I've got a 160, 165 proof.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.966
I think we're gonna
need to be 180, 190 proof.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.200
So how you figure
we do that?

32:17.202 --> 32:19.169
I got the perfect idea.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.049
<i> [digger] let me get them</i>
<i>  two jugs of corn liquor.</i>

32:32.051 --> 32:34.217
[mark] now, this is
a stainless steel vat.

32:34.219 --> 32:37.788
It will impart no cloudiness,
it will impart no taste.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.122
Our last ditch effort,

32:39.124 --> 32:41.325
we're gonna put the liquor
straight into the pan

32:41.327 --> 32:43.827
<i>  on this ultrasonic</i>
<i>  cleaning machine,</i>

32:43.829 --> 32:45.963
and then put chips in
there floating around.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.831
We ain't gonna mess
with this rye liquor.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.334
We gotta have them
six gallons for sure.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.203
That got my society finger.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.872
We're just going to use
corn liquor to experiment.

32:55.874 --> 32:59.776
<i>  We only have six gallons</i>
<i>  of the unaged rye left,</i>

32:59.778 --> 33:01.812
and that is what
our order is for.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.780
I think you might be
on to something here.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.616
I mean, we've tried everything
else we know to try.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.319
This either works
or we're done with this thing.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.154
Well, moment of truth.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.423
Look at that. Damn.

33:14.860 --> 33:18.261
[mark] well, that looks
different than anything
we've done with it yet.

33:18.263 --> 33:21.898
<i> [digger] we go ahead and fire</i>
<i>  the machine up before</i>
<i>  we put any chips in,</i>

33:21.900 --> 33:24.568
and just immediately
it turns milky white.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.370
Still a little smoke
bombs in there.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.804
[mark] what's causing that?

33:27.806 --> 33:29.840
[digger] well, it cleared up
though, just then.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.541
It just got little poofs
here and there.

33:31.543 --> 33:32.976
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  these little old cyclones,</i>

33:32.978 --> 33:35.846
<i>  they're kind of like</i>
<i>  little ghosts running</i>
<i>  around in there.</i>

33:35.848 --> 33:39.583
They just all of a sudden
form, they'll swirl around
and they'll travel off.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.985
It looks like little sperm
swimming away.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.286
I don't believe
I'd have compared it to that.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.721
Well, look at it.

33:44.723 --> 33:45.822
<i> [digger] really weird</i>
<i>  watching them,</i>

33:45.824 --> 33:47.924
but it really gives you
an indication

33:47.926 --> 33:50.961
of what these vibrations
or sound waves are doing.

33:50.963 --> 33:53.130
Well, let's drop
some chips in there.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.800
These chips,
they're absolutely as clean
as they're gonna get.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.136
<i>  They've been soaking</i>
<i>  for several days.</i>

33:59.138 --> 34:01.571
Let's let it run
for a few minutes
and see what we got.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.941
<i>  You know, this has</i>
<i>  been a lot of work,</i>
<i>  but it's worth the effort.</i>

34:04.943 --> 34:09.513
If this thing works,
this could change the whole
industry as we know it now.

34:17.589 --> 34:18.889
That right there
is widow maker.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.791
I'm gonna get rid of it.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.026
And I'm gonna put it up
between the forks of
that there tree, right yonder.

34:23.028 --> 34:24.494
[jerry] I bet you don't even
hit that tree.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.263
I bet you hit this tree
over here, on this side.

34:26.265 --> 34:30.033
All right, so if I'm halfway
over to the left,

34:30.035 --> 34:31.768
-you gotta be
better than halfway.
-I win.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.236
-No. No, listen.
-[jerry] better than halfway.

34:33.238 --> 34:34.704
You're gonna put it in
the forks of the tree.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.573
You at least need to be
halfway close to it.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.708
Bet you a steak dinner
you don't even hit
that tree up there.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.144
You got a bet.
If I hit it, I win.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.146
-You hit it,
you definitely win.
-All right.

34:43.348 --> 34:44.481
[chainsaw whirring]

34:53.225 --> 34:55.158
[chuckles] I put it over.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.060
You didn't put it in the fork
of that tree, though.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.261
I hit the damn limb.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.597
[jerry] oh, the wind
blew them limbs.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.933
You owe me
a steak dinner, jerry.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.034
[jerry] you still didn't
hit it, though.

35:04.036 --> 35:05.435
[mike chuckles]

35:09.875 --> 35:13.076
[mike] damn, son.
We look like a bunch
of mad scientists.

35:13.078 --> 35:15.679
<i>  Me and jerry,</i>
<i>  we got through running</i>
<i>  our cornbread shine.</i>

35:15.681 --> 35:17.180
It's some really good stuff.

35:17.182 --> 35:19.749
You sure we can make it
higher proof alcohol?

35:19.751 --> 35:22.285
Now, all we gotta do
is make high-proofed alcohol.

35:22.287 --> 35:26.089
It's gonna pull and extract
the capsaicin in the flavor
for those peppers.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.891
<i>  And then infuse</i>
<i>  our jalapeno oil,</i>

35:27.893 --> 35:30.260
and make some good jalapeno
cornbread shine.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.696
<i> [jerry] basically,</i>
<i>  what we got here is</i>
<i>  what they call an apparatus.</i>

35:32.698 --> 35:35.332
<i>  Basically, it's just</i>
<i>  a glass still</i>

35:35.334 --> 35:37.200
<i>  that does everything</i>
<i>  on a smaller volume.</i>

35:37.202 --> 35:39.636
That apparatus
is a miniature glass still.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.738
We'll be able to take some
high proof that we have,

35:41.740 --> 35:44.074
to be able to bump it up
to the higher proof
that we need,

35:44.076 --> 35:46.176
<i> to be able to pull that flavor</i>
<i>  out of those peppers.</i>

35:46.178 --> 35:49.279
We need to be up
around 180 to 190 proof.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.915
<i> [mike] I'm not really sure</i>
<i>  what the proof is on this.</i>

35:51.917 --> 35:53.483
Let's see what that is.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.787
165. With the still there,
we shouldn't have no
trouble hitting that number.

35:57.789 --> 36:01.258
No. We need to ground
these peppers before
we get things really rolling.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.160
<i> [mike] we took fresh jalapeno,</i>
<i>  dried them out.</i>

36:03.162 --> 36:04.628
Going to grind them up.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.298
<i> [jerry] once ground up</i>
<i>  into a powder,</i>

36:08.300 --> 36:10.901
it's a lot easier
for the alcohol to break
down the powder

36:10.903 --> 36:12.969
than it would be just
a full piece of pepper.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.038
Smell that.
Take a whiff of it.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.339
I don't think so.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.140
I know what that's--

36:17.142 --> 36:18.642
-[chokes and coughs]
-[jerry] yeah.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.177
<i> [jerry] we got our peppers</i>
<i>  ground down,</i>

36:20.179 --> 36:22.078
and basically, our high proof,
we'll dump right in
on the powder,

36:22.080 --> 36:24.447
<i>  make a tincture,</i>
<i>  we're gonna add it</i>
<i>  back to our alcohol.</i>

36:24.449 --> 36:26.149
So that's why we're using
the high-proof alcohol,

36:26.151 --> 36:28.084
to actually start
that process out.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.719
[mike] light that
damn still up, son.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.687
[jerry] turn the hose on.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.422
[mike] we've done a lot
of runs in our time,

36:32.424 --> 36:35.158
but we've never been able
to actually look inside
the still itself.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.762
[jerry] this is pretty cool.
I never get to actually
watch alcohol boil.

36:38.764 --> 36:42.632
We're just looking
for a subtle note
of jalapeno flavor

36:42.634 --> 36:44.568
<i>  with a little warmth</i>
<i>  to the throat,</i>

36:44.570 --> 36:47.270
and finished with that
sweet cornbread on the back.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.338
There we go.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.439
[jerry] there we are.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.274
[chuckles] we made
it, brother.

36:51.276 --> 36:53.343
We got her going.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.078
<i> [mike] we're just gonna</i>
<i>  let that fill up</i>

36:55.080 --> 36:57.447
and let that stuff start
extracting out.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.115
<i>  You know, stir it up,</i>
<i>  stir it around,</i>

36:59.117 --> 37:01.451
get that good color,
then we'll strain it.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.987
If I just ground all these
peppers up into a powder

37:03.989 --> 37:05.655
and started mixing
it in my alcohol,

37:05.657 --> 37:07.090
<i>  yes, you'd have that flavor,</i>

37:07.092 --> 37:10.160
but you're gonna have
all these floaties
and all these particles

37:10.162 --> 37:12.195
in your alcohol
that you don't need.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.264
[jerry] that's some
green goodness there.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.166
[mike] the green goblin.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.101
It's the fuzz now. Whoo!

37:23.742 --> 37:26.142
Okay, with that face,
I damn sure aren't trying it.

37:26.144 --> 37:28.211
It feels like yellow jackets
in your mouth,

37:28.213 --> 37:30.914
but it's got
a phenomenal flavor.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.148
I'm gonna do a vial.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.117
[jerry] whoa! Whoa!

37:34.620 --> 37:35.885
-What are you doing?
-I know.

37:35.887 --> 37:39.022
-Now listen to me now.
We gotta make it.
-Oh, my god.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.690
[jerry] I can see that clear
to the bottom now.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.192
Well, you gotta see it.

37:46.365 --> 37:49.332
-Yeah, she's right.
-[jerry] a little
too much, huh?

37:49.401 --> 37:50.367
No.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.308
Now, by god, that's right.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.013
[sputters]

38:03.015 --> 38:04.114
[mike] what the hell's
wrong with you?

38:04.116 --> 38:08.251
-Right?
-[mike] hell, yeah.
That's right for me.

38:08.253 --> 38:11.187
-No, dude. That is [bleep]
just wrong is what that is.
-Jerry!

38:11.189 --> 38:12.789
No!

38:12.791 --> 38:15.892
You know, subtle jalapeno
flavor is a lot different with
me than it is with jerry.

38:15.894 --> 38:20.930
One dropper full
to each jar is perfect.

38:20.932 --> 38:24.100
But there's a lot of people
out there in the world
like me.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.435
They're gonna want this stuff.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.306
Man, I'm behind you.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.274
You say you can sell it.

38:31.276 --> 38:32.242
I can do it, brother.

38:32.244 --> 38:34.878
You know, I'm right there
behind you to do it.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.280
I'll tell you what.
This stuff has turned
out phenomenally.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.616
<i>  It's at the right balance</i>
<i>  of heat and taste</i>

38:39.618 --> 38:41.651
<i>  of the jalapeno</i>
<i>  and the cornbread.</i>

38:41.653 --> 38:45.021
You can taste all notes
coming through each jar
of this stuff.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.058
I'm going to find us a buyer
and we'll make money, baby.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.359
Jalapeno cornbread.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.261
It's going out the door.
I promise you.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.511
Well, it's quit.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.879
[mark] let's see what we got.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.716
This is our last ditch effort
on this ultrasonic aging.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.118
<i>  Put the liquor straight</i>
<i>  into the pan,</i>

39:15.120 --> 39:17.954
if it doesn't work on
this one, this is the third
strike, we're out.

39:17.956 --> 39:18.755
It's going to be cloudy.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.123
[mark] no, it ain't.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.961
-Look at that.
-[digger] well,
that color is right.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.830
The color is really good.

39:26.832 --> 39:30.633
I pulled the lid off,
and on first sight,
it looks great.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.902
[digger] can't tell much
about the cloud yet.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.305
Let's run her down
in this rascal here.
Color is perfect.

39:35.307 --> 39:38.041
I don't see anything
that's telling us
we've gone wrong yet.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.276
[mark] we may be on
to something here, puss.

39:40.278 --> 39:43.146
<i> [digger] I get a bottle,</i>
<i>  drop the hose down in it,</i>
<i>  it fills up,</i>

39:43.148 --> 39:44.414
put the lid on.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.284
-No.
-Nope.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.887
<i> [digger] we hold that bottle</i>
<i>  up and it looks like</i>
<i>  pond water.</i>

39:50.889 --> 39:52.789
Cloudy, no good.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.792
[mark] this is fine
for us to drink,
but we can't sell that.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.094
<i> [digger] I know that</i>
<i>  there's nothing wrong</i>
<i>  with this whiskey,</i>

39:58.096 --> 40:01.464
but as far as selling it,
no, that's not an option.

40:01.466 --> 40:04.334
[mark] it don't like
that vibration,
that sound wave.

40:04.336 --> 40:05.869
<i>  That ain't no good.</i>

40:05.871 --> 40:07.137
Looks like stuff
swirling around.

40:07.139 --> 40:11.708
<i>  And the ultrasonic machine</i>
<i> itself has some adverse effect</i>

40:11.710 --> 40:15.745
either on the liquor,
on the chips,
or a combination of the two.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.847
Well, you know what
we've done here, don't you?

40:17.849 --> 40:19.115
We screwed up
some more liquor.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.984
[chuckles] we messed up
two more gallons of liquor.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.753
Ultrasonic aging is a bust.

40:23.755 --> 40:27.090
<i>  I'm not too proud</i>
<i>  and I'm not too big</i>
<i>  to know when I'm whooped.</i>

40:27.092 --> 40:30.927
And when it comes to
ultrasonic aging whiskey,
I'm whooped.

40:30.929 --> 40:35.899
We've done everything
in our power to give
this thing a chance to work.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.902
There ain't no magic wand
for aging liquor.

40:38.904 --> 40:41.037
<i> [mark] you know, we was</i>
<i>  looking for a shortcut.</i>

40:41.039 --> 40:42.872
Now, we're really
under the gun.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.908
I got no idea where we go
from here,

40:44.910 --> 40:47.444
-except do what we know works.
-Yeah.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.113
So we're going back
to the old tried
and true method.

40:50.115 --> 40:55.018
We're going to get it into
jugs as quickly as possible
with a big bunch of chips.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.653
<i>  We messed up enough liquor.</i>

40:56.655 --> 40:59.255
<i> [mark] we're gonna babysit</i>
<i>  this liquor for a month.</i>

40:59.257 --> 41:02.158
Every day, we'll just
ease up here
and we'll shake this thing,

41:02.160 --> 41:03.460
keep it moving.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.196
<i> [digger] we'll put it in</i>
<i>  a small barrel</i>
<i>  for a few weeks,</i>

41:06.198 --> 41:08.565
and then it truly
is barrel-finished.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.133
<i>  It's gonna be more workhorse.</i>

41:10.135 --> 41:12.402
But we promised
we'd get this liquor
in two months,

41:12.404 --> 41:13.303
and we're gonna do it.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.004
Go with what you know.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.239
Ain't no way around it.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.775
<i>  You know, we've just bought</i>
<i>  ourself a little more work.</i>

41:18.777 --> 41:22.145
But it could be a big shot
in the arm down the road
with these clients

41:22.147 --> 41:24.047
<i>  if it's a good product.</i>

41:24.049 --> 41:27.050
So we gotta do what we do
to make it the best it can be.
