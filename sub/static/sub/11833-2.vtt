00:00.801 --> 00:02.636
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.669 --> 00:03.670
Did you murder her
because she was going

00:03.703 --> 00:05.438
to break off
a sexual affair?

00:05.471 --> 00:08.775
I did not have an affair with
her, and I did not kill her!

00:08.809 --> 00:10.777
You're going down for murder
now, you get that?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.112
It was Steven.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.647
Your son Steven?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.782
I saw the dark clothes
on him when he left.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.651
Why haven't you
told anybody?

00:17.684 --> 00:20.153
Because I don't want
him to spend life in jail

00:20.186 --> 00:21.354
for something I drove him to.

00:21.387 --> 00:23.757
-Let me go to the D. A.
-Absolutely not.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.626
This is between you
and me.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.227
You gave me your word.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.296
Man: We find
the defendant guilty.

00:31.497 --> 00:33.266
I didn't do it.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.735
I didn't do it.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.641
Jimmy, are you okay?

00:40.674 --> 00:43.143
What? Oh, uh,
I was just thinking

00:43.176 --> 00:45.746
about something
the doctor said.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.147
What are you
looking for?

00:47.180 --> 00:48.081
Evidence in connection

00:48.114 --> 00:50.517
with the attempted murder
of Lindsay Dole.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.818
What?

00:51.852 --> 00:54.087
On what basis do you
get such a warrant?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.822
I'm sorry.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.424
I saw the picture
of Bobby and Lindsay

00:58.458 --> 01:00.426
with the face
all scratched.

01:00.460 --> 01:03.429
My brain just started
going sideways.

01:18.845 --> 01:21.548
Lindsay, Lindsay, are --

01:21.582 --> 01:23.650
Oh, sorry.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.386
Do you guys brush or you
just start right in
with morning breath?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.387
Helen.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.255
Never mind I just got
called to a crime scene

01:29.289 --> 01:30.256
so I got to go.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.559
Okay well, thanks for
coming in to tell me.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.393
Sorry again.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.398
She's not sorry.
She likes doing that.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.133
I'll get a lock.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.168
Never mind a lock.

01:46.339 --> 01:47.541
Move in with me.

01:47.574 --> 01:48.509
Bobby.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.711
Why do we have to wait
till we're married?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.312
We haven't set the date.

01:52.345 --> 01:55.315
You can still wear white
if we live together first.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.317
Tell that to my father.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.752
What about Helen?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.321
She can't afford this place
by herself.

02:01.354 --> 02:04.625
And that's the real issue,
isn't it?

02:04.658 --> 02:07.293
You don't want
to bail on Helen.

02:07.327 --> 02:10.330
We go back and forth
just to collect clothes.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.633
This is ridiculous.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.646
What do we got?

02:25.679 --> 02:28.381
Big ticket. The suspect's
thepresident of
Boston Liberty bank--

02:28.414 --> 02:29.716
Pierce Stanton.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.284
This is officer Henderson.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.719
Helen Gamble,
district attorney.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.721
Okay, let's go take a look.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.190
I pulled him over
for a traffic violation.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.292
He ran a stop sign.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.327
I haven't
touched anything yet.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.203
And he confessed?

02:50.236 --> 02:52.873
Just started crying
and said he strangled her.

03:01.447 --> 03:03.283
Mr. Stanton,
I'm Helen Gamble

03:03.316 --> 03:04.951
from the
district attorney's office.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.588
We're going to take you
to the police station.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.322
And we'd like you
to make a statement, okay?

03:09.355 --> 03:10.123
We'll try to help you.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.592
I think I should call
my lawyer.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.226
Okay. That's fine.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.596
Would you call him?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.632
His name is Bobby Donnell.
I'm sure he's listed.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.206
â™ª

04:09.783 --> 04:11.552
She may have jumped the gun on
the search a little,

04:11.585 --> 04:12.819
that's why
I called you down here.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.954
Jumped the gun how?

04:13.987 --> 04:16.923
Well, reasonable suspicion
is iffy.

04:16.957 --> 04:17.923
She's the one
he confessed to?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.526
Yeah.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.795
Officer Henderson.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.666
Can you come by my office
this morning?

04:25.699 --> 04:26.833
Sure.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.435
Okay. Bye, Mike.

04:43.750 --> 04:47.020
I can't continue
to just sit on this.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.421
You gave me your word,
Jimmy.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.390
Let me ask you something,
Henry.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.825
Are you sure?

04:51.858 --> 04:53.860
Have you talked
to your son about it?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.996
It's a little difficult
to have a conversation

04:56.029 --> 04:57.664
from where I'm situated
at the moment.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.065
Have you told your wife?

04:59.099 --> 05:00.734
No.

05:00.767 --> 05:04.404
So what we got here,
your son's a killer

05:04.437 --> 05:07.007
living in your home
with your wife

05:07.040 --> 05:08.675
and your 11-year-old
daughter.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.811
Aren't you concerned
as a father?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
Of course, but --

05:12.045 --> 05:13.580
how can you stay quiet?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.749
I can't necessarily
trust Allison not to tell.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.450
She might tell out of
concern for him.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.819
The kid needs help.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.653
I don't want
to have this discussion --

05:19.686 --> 05:21.855
We're going
to have this discussion!

05:23.423 --> 05:25.826
Man: Sir, I'll have to
ask you to leave

05:25.859 --> 05:27.794
if you do that again.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.099
Henry,
you're an intelligent man.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.402
You've got to know
this is not smart.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.839
You're in jail for a crime
you didn't commit.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.041
Your son is
in desperate need of help

05:41.074 --> 05:42.676
and isn't getting it.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.478
For god's sake, Henry.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.415
I don't know what to do
any more, Jimmy.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.823
I can't see him
go to prison.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.825
I couldn't live
with that.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.828
You trusted me once.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.131
I know a judge
I think I can trust.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.133
Let me talk to her,

06:07.167 --> 06:09.870
and maybe my partners.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.006
They'll keep
my confidence.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.976
I promise.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.048
I didn't plan it.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.050
It wasn't like
it was premeditated.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.786
Just tell me
what happened.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.488
We'd been fighting,

06:28.522 --> 06:31.892
which we'd been doing
a lot of lately,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.493
and she wasn't happy.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.495
She kept saying
she wasn't happy

06:35.529 --> 06:37.130
about this
and about that.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.632
It was building.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.634
Everything that I did
wasn't good enough,

06:40.667 --> 06:43.770
whether it be my personality
or my sperm count

06:43.804 --> 06:46.172
or the way I rinse
a damn dish.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.642
I buy her a $3 million home
in Cambridge,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.644
and every time
I drive home to it,

06:50.677 --> 06:52.078
I'm afraid to go inside

06:52.112 --> 06:54.715
because I know I'm going
to get an earful

06:54.748 --> 06:56.049
of how I don't measure up.
I got sick of it Bobby.

06:56.082 --> 07:00.887
Calm down
and tell me what happened.

07:02.488 --> 07:05.992
Like I said,
we were having an argument,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.193
and she's saying
she hates this,

07:07.227 --> 07:08.795
she hates that,

07:08.829 --> 07:10.897
and I said to her,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.066
"it's me you hate,
isn't it?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.901
It's me."

07:14.935 --> 07:16.937
And she says
maybe she does.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.539
Then there's
some more screaming,

07:18.572 --> 07:20.674
and suddenly my hands
are on her throat.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.809
I don't know what
the argument was about.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.078
But my hands are on her throat
and I'm squeezing,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.213
and I'm squeezing
as hard as I can,

07:27.247 --> 07:29.182
and suddenly she goes limp.

07:29.215 --> 07:32.819
I let her go.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.855
Where were you going
with her?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.557
What?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.058
With her in the trunk.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.198
She had made plans
to go shopping in town,

07:45.231 --> 07:48.702
and she told some friends.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.236
I was going to try

07:50.270 --> 07:52.272
to make it look like a
mugging or something,

07:52.305 --> 07:54.541
then I ran a stop sign.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.079
You believe it?

07:59.112 --> 08:03.049
Okay, how much
of what you just told me

08:03.083 --> 08:05.118
did you tell
that police officer?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.590
All of it.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.272
Helen.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.708
What are you
doing here?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.175
Stanton case.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.077
It takes two
to do an arraignment now?

08:31.111 --> 08:34.548
No. Actually,
I came to see you.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.282
Oh.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.919
I'm going to move in
with Bobby.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.155
Oh. When?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.826
Well, pretty much
right away.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.194
I'm there half the time
anyway, so...

08:48.228 --> 08:50.831
Is this because
I walked in on you guys?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.066
'cause I can cut back
on that.

08:53.099 --> 08:57.638
No, it's something that
we've been talking about.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.206
Okay, but I'm going
to have to move out.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.208
I can't swing that place
on my own.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.077
You can find
another roommate.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.178
Lindsay,
who am I going to find?

09:05.211 --> 09:06.780
Women don't like me.

09:06.813 --> 09:07.614
Men just want
to sleep with me.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.916
I end up wanting
to sleep with them.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.618
It's a vicious cycle.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.686
Woman: 32114...

09:12.719 --> 09:13.687
I got to go.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.321
Commonwealth vs Pierce Stanton

09:15.355 --> 09:17.290
on the charge of murder in the
first degree.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.925
Bobby Donnell
for the defendant your honor--

09:18.959 --> 09:20.627
waive reading,
plead not guilty.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.928
Helen Gamble
for the commonwealth --

09:21.962 --> 09:22.996
oppose bail.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.031
My client has established
roots in the community--

09:25.065 --> 09:26.066
-Murder one.
-Event so.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.333
Bail is denied.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.069
Move for a probable
cause hearing.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.937
2:00. Put the defendant
back in the lockup.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.106
Next case.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.242
Any offers?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.811
Bobby, he confessed.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.914
What kind of deal
do you expect me to cut?

09:49.956 --> 09:51.958
Jimmy.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.727
You got a second?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.297
I suppose.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.704
I know Eleanor was in last
week hitting you up for
the special favors.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.906
I promise this ain't about that.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.709
I love when you use words
like ain't.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.945
Eloquence has
a way of leaving me moist.

10:13.747 --> 10:14.715
Listen...

10:15.816 --> 10:18.384
I know your integrity
as a judge

10:18.418 --> 10:20.420
comes above anything else,

10:20.453 --> 10:24.324
and I'm here, actually,
to ask your help or advice.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.727
It's kind of a grave thing.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.195
I'm listening.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.897
I would appreciate it

10:30.931 --> 10:32.899
if we could keep this
confidential

10:32.933 --> 10:34.334
'cause it involves

10:34.367 --> 10:36.837
a privileged relationship
on my end.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.006
I got a client convicted
of a serious crime

10:40.040 --> 10:42.275
which he didn't commit.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.745
His son committed it.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.713
My client
doesn't want his son

10:46.747 --> 10:49.816
to go to prison
for the rest of his life,

10:49.850 --> 10:52.118
so he's taking the fall.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.088
I can't convince him
to come forward with the truth.

10:55.121 --> 10:59.259
Nevertheless,
I got the truth.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.727
Do you have evidence

11:00.761 --> 11:02.395
that the son
committed the crime?

11:02.428 --> 11:05.365
Well, just my client's word,
but it's a good word.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.299
So basically,

11:06.332 --> 11:08.835
you've got a client
convicted of a crime

11:08.869 --> 11:11.037
who says he's innocent.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.973
You expect what?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.375
I don't know,
but this isn't just a case

11:15.408 --> 11:17.377
of the convicted guy
saying he's innocent.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.979
It's exactly that.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.015
That's what happens
in 90% of the cases.

11:22.048 --> 11:25.385
Now, you have new evidence,
you take it to the D. A.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.421
If you don't --
what am I missing here?

11:28.454 --> 11:33.093
Well, I guess I am looking
for a favor,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.028
though I don't see it
like that.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.030
We're both officers
of the court.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.398
An injustice has occurred.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.434
If I go to the D. A.,
he's just going to laugh.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.737
It's going to seem exactly
as you said.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.872
I'm going to look like
every defense attorney

11:45.906 --> 11:47.307
throwing a hail Mary,

11:47.340 --> 11:50.243
but if I go in
with a judge,

11:50.276 --> 11:51.512
that might give me
some credibility.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.513
Get out.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.515
If I could convince you

11:54.548 --> 11:56.517
that what I'm saying
is true --

11:56.550 --> 11:58.318
I said get out.

11:58.351 --> 12:02.088
You could help prevent
a big miscarriage here.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.090
This "integrity
of the robe" thing,

12:04.124 --> 12:05.091
that's just a bunch
of crap.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.194
Hey, you think I won't
hold you in contempt?

12:08.228 --> 12:11.197
Go ahead. We'd be even.

12:20.040 --> 12:24.010
And no matter how hard I try
to change his mind,

12:24.044 --> 12:25.445
he won't budge.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.847
The son did it?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.782
-Yes.
-And you knew this.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.551
I didn't know
till closing arguments.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.918
Why didn't you tell us?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.286
I gave him my word.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.855
We're his lawyers on this case.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.857
Don't you start in on me,
damn it.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.959
I gave him my word.
That has to count for something.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.294
Alright let's calm down and
figure out where we're going
from here.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.563
Can we go to the D. A.?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.130
Bay? Forget it.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.366
Without evidence,
Bay is just going to laugh.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.536
A confession is new evidence.
I say we go to the son.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.805
We can't reveal
what we heard from Henry --

12:51.838 --> 12:53.306
client privilege.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.141
You broke privilege
when you went to Kittleson.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.043
Kittleson won't talk!
And I asked you not to start in.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.078
Alright.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.245
Look, Go to Henry.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.947
Get his permission
to talk to his son.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.148
He'll just say no.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.884
He wants to spend life
in jail?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.486
Yes. That's what
I keep telling you.

13:10.190 --> 13:14.027
Let me have a little chat
with Henry.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.033
Please have a seat.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.573
How long have you
been a police officer?

13:26.607 --> 13:27.574
Two years.

13:27.608 --> 13:30.977
Do you remember learning
anything at the academy

13:31.011 --> 13:32.579
about the fourth amendment?

13:34.214 --> 13:37.918
What right did you have
to open that trunk?

13:37.951 --> 13:40.086
He was acting suspiciously.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.055
We've got a problem,
officer.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.525
You had no legal grounds
to conduct that search.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.196
Unless...

13:50.230 --> 13:52.833
I see he didn't have
his registration on him.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.202
That's right.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.204
See, I think what happened

13:58.238 --> 14:00.941
is you decided
to impound the vehicle.

14:00.974 --> 14:05.345
Once you made that decision,
you then conducted

14:05.378 --> 14:08.481
an inventory search
of the vehicle.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.884
Is that what happened?

14:10.917 --> 14:13.987
Yes.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.455
Okay well, we need
to be clear on that

14:15.488 --> 14:17.257
once you get
in the witness chair,

14:17.290 --> 14:19.425
otherwise the contents
of that trunk together

14:19.459 --> 14:21.494
with the confession
will be suppressed.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.564
Are we clear?

14:23.597 --> 14:25.131
Yes.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.232
Good.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.234
You might want
to get some coffee.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.970
You're on in an hour.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.882
Roberta.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.355
Can I speak to you
in private?

14:53.694 --> 14:56.630
First of all,

14:56.663 --> 14:58.331
you had no right to reveal to me
your client's --

14:58.364 --> 15:00.233
I didn't give you names.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.937
I can figure it out.
Give me some credit.

15:03.970 --> 15:07.340
Are you sure your client
is telling the truth?

15:07.373 --> 15:08.509
Yes.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.511
What you first need to do

15:10.544 --> 15:13.179
is get his permission
to talk to the son.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.314
Eugene's trying
to do that now.

15:14.347 --> 15:18.218
Assuming he consents,
you need to get the boy counsel.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.621
I would then try to secure
a written confession

15:20.654 --> 15:21.988
with counsel.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.990
Then you take that
to the district attorney

15:24.024 --> 15:25.425
and you go from there,

15:25.458 --> 15:27.293
but the boy
must have counsel.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.394
Yeah.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.001
The reason
I got so angry --

15:35.035 --> 15:38.004
when somebody so much as asks
for special treatment

15:38.038 --> 15:40.273
on the basis
of a personal relationship,

15:40.306 --> 15:43.009
I consider it
a professional indictment

15:43.043 --> 15:44.444
and I take offense.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.581
I wasn't trying to insult you
professionally, Roberta.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.150
Everybody knows
you're a great judge.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.385
That's why
I came to you --

15:52.418 --> 15:54.721
for advice,

15:54.755 --> 15:58.559
and maybe a little
because I missed you.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.564
Well...

16:05.699 --> 16:07.634
You have my advice.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.575
I pulled him over

16:14.608 --> 16:16.577
after he failed
to stop for the sign.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.579
He appeared
to be very nervous.

16:18.612 --> 16:20.180
What happened then?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.616
I asked for his license
and registration.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.217
He didn't have
his registration,

16:24.250 --> 16:26.486
so I decided
to impound the vehicle.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.388
I then ordered the suspect

16:28.421 --> 16:30.624
out of the vehicle
and then searched it.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.060
I discovered the body
of a deceased woman in the
trunk.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.596
What happened next?

16:35.629 --> 16:37.430
He then basically broke down

16:37.463 --> 16:39.633
and told me
he had murdered his wife

16:39.666 --> 16:42.102
and was planning
to dispose of the body

16:42.135 --> 16:43.504
to avoid being caught.

16:43.537 --> 16:45.572
Thank you, officer.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.179
You said
he was acting nervously.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.347
Very.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.117
Did his behavior
make you suspicious?

16:57.150 --> 17:00.787
Well, I suppose
it did a little.

17:00.821 --> 17:03.489
He looked like
he was hiding something.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.458
You said you ordered
the suspect out

17:05.491 --> 17:07.193
and then searched
the trunk.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.229
What was he a suspect of?

17:09.262 --> 17:12.198
He wasn't a suspect
at that time.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.502
He became a suspect
after I opened the trunk.

17:15.536 --> 17:17.538
You said you ordered
the suspect out.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.540
Shall we read back
your testimony?

17:19.573 --> 17:20.574
I misstated it.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.777
He wasn't a suspect
until I opened the trunk.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.647
Okay, and when you went
to search the trunk,

17:27.681 --> 17:30.584
was it because you thought
he was hiding something there?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.753
No, that was
an inventory search.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.221
I had decided
to impound the vehicle,

17:35.255 --> 17:37.257
so I did
an inventory search.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.825
Why were you impounding
the vehicle?

17:38.859 --> 17:41.127
Because he didn't have
any registration.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.395
The car wasn't registered?

17:42.428 --> 17:45.198
It turned out
to be registered,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.167
but he didn't have
the registration on him.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.169
Is it your policy
to impound registered vehicles

17:49.202 --> 17:51.371
when the driver isn't in
possession of the registration?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.840
No. I didn't know
it was registered when I
decided to impound it.

17:53.874 --> 17:55.441
You call in the plates?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.110
No.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.412
Isn't it procedure to call in
the plates to determined whether
a car is registered?

17:59.445 --> 18:01.214
Many officers do that.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.183
I didn't on this occasion.
I suppose I could have.

18:03.216 --> 18:06.119
You suppose
you could have.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.521
Did you tell my client

18:07.554 --> 18:09.322
you were impounding
his car when you asked him to
open his trunk?

18:09.355 --> 18:10.591
I don't recall.

18:10.624 --> 18:11.658
-Did you call a tow truck?
-No.

18:11.692 --> 18:13.827
-Why not?
-No. I hadn't gotten
to that yet.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.195
Were you planning
to get to that?

18:15.228 --> 18:16.730
-Objection.
-Overruled.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.365
I was going to order he truck
after I did the search.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.667
Officer Henderson,
we all know

18:20.701 --> 18:22.302
how long it takes
tow trucks to show up.

18:22.335 --> 18:26.873
It's your testimony that you
planned to search first and then
call for the truck?

18:26.907 --> 18:30.176
Yes.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.213
Okay, when you went
to search the trunk,

18:33.246 --> 18:35.549
you didn't tell my client
you were taking his car.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.383
You didn't tell him he'd have
to get picked up by somebody?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.220
Or hitch a ride
to the station?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.622
No.

18:41.655 --> 18:43.590
Your Honor the defense moves to
suppress the contents of the
trunk

18:43.624 --> 18:45.325
together with
my client's confession.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.326
Opposed.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.662
I'll hear oral arguments
tomorrow morning, 10:00.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.512
He says we can't talk
to the son.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.582
So now what?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.250
It's over.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.719
It's not over.

19:12.753 --> 19:14.921
Jimmy, there's nothing more
we can do.

19:14.955 --> 19:16.523
It can't be over.

19:16.557 --> 19:17.924
We just don't sit back
saying it's over

19:17.958 --> 19:20.561
while the wrong guy
sits in jail.

19:25.799 --> 19:27.801
I think we should
confront the son anyway.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.935
Can't do that.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.203
Why not? If --

19:30.236 --> 19:32.973
Because he instructed you not
to. you can't talk to the kid

19:33.006 --> 19:34.808
without revealing
a lawyer-client communication.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.410
Eugene, what are we
supposed to do here,

19:37.443 --> 19:39.412
forget about it? Move on
while an innocent man

19:39.445 --> 19:41.281
serves a life sentence?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.783
That's exactly
what we do, Jimmy.

19:42.816 --> 19:44.885
Now if you want to go
through the transcripts,

19:44.918 --> 19:46.887
find an appealable issue,
do it,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.889
but what the client
told you in confidence,

19:48.922 --> 19:50.423
you keep it in confidence.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.491
Not when it amounts to --

19:51.525 --> 19:53.760
Jimmy, you can't do it.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.315
Um, I'm here
to see Mr. Berluti.

20:15.348 --> 20:15.982
Steven, hey.

20:16.016 --> 20:16.983
Hey.

20:17.017 --> 20:18.251
Thanks for coming.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.019
Had no trouble
getting here?

20:19.052 --> 20:20.554
No. I took the "T."

20:20.587 --> 20:22.889
Here, let's use this office
right here.

20:22.923 --> 20:24.591
Jimmy, can I talk to you a
second?

20:24.625 --> 20:26.793
Go ahead, Steve.
I'll be right in.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.997
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to talk to him.

20:31.031 --> 20:32.933
We didn't get permission
from his father to talk to him.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.535
I won't be revealing
anything Henry said --

20:34.568 --> 20:36.402
Jimmy, you can't reveal
client privileged information.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.738
There's no way
you can talk to him without--

20:37.771 --> 20:39.005
I won't say
what his father told me.

20:39.039 --> 20:40.440
How do you accuse him
of the crime

20:40.473 --> 20:41.942
without violating privilege?

20:41.975 --> 20:44.611
You don't have any
independent information
other than what Henry told you.

20:44.645 --> 20:46.747
Eugene, If I get called
before the bar,

20:46.780 --> 20:48.348
I get called
before the bar. I really
don't care anymore.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.617
I'm going in there
with you.

20:50.651 --> 20:52.853
No, you're staying
out here.

21:07.801 --> 21:11.337
The officer admitted
he seemed suspicious,

21:11.371 --> 21:13.339
thought maybe
he was hiding something,

21:13.373 --> 21:15.509
so what did she do?

21:15.542 --> 21:18.044
She opened the trunk.

21:18.078 --> 21:20.080
And anybody
with a law degree knows

21:20.113 --> 21:21.414
she made a mistake.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.717
This was no inventory search.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.452
She never said she was going
to impound the vehicle.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.321
The police
don't seize vehicles

21:28.354 --> 21:29.856
when the drivers
don't have proof

21:29.890 --> 21:31.324
of registration.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.426
They just call the plates in
to check.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.394
It takes 30 seconds.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.663
She never called a tow truck.

21:36.697 --> 21:38.431
She said she was going
to do that after.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.503
Please. We all know
what's going on here.

21:42.536 --> 21:44.938
They've decided to call it
an inventory search

21:44.971 --> 21:46.607
to justify it.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.676
Nothing in the behavior
of that police officer

21:49.710 --> 21:52.045
is consistent
with police procedure

21:52.078 --> 21:55.315
on an inventory search.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.620
This all hinges on what officer
Henderson was thinking

21:59.653 --> 22:01.054
when she opened that trunk.

22:01.087 --> 22:04.024
We have her word
that it was inventory

22:04.057 --> 22:07.093
versus Bobby Donnell's ability
to read minds.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.530
Come on counsel, how many
officers are out there taking
cars

22:09.563 --> 22:12.799
because the drivers can't find
their registration?

22:12.833 --> 22:14.100
Maybe she was
a little overzealous.

22:14.134 --> 22:15.636
She's 27 years old.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.104
Young police officers
get that way sometimes.

22:18.138 --> 22:20.073
So what. She hadn't taken him
into custody.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.776
She hadn't placed him
under arrest.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.911
He wasn't any kind
of suspect.

22:24.945 --> 22:27.548
By officer Henderson's own
uncontroverted testimony,

22:27.581 --> 22:28.915
it was an inventory search,

22:28.949 --> 22:31.818
and defense counsel
is standing up here

22:31.852 --> 22:33.386
asking you to read minds,

22:33.419 --> 22:36.389
asking you
to play guessing games,

22:36.422 --> 22:40.393
asking you to suppress
the contents of that trunk.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.929
Anybody with a law degree
knows what happens

22:42.963 --> 22:46.232
if you do, don't we?

22:50.103 --> 22:52.138
It's a lie.

22:52.172 --> 22:54.575
Is it, Steven?

22:54.608 --> 22:58.845
Your dad saw you
going out the door.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.146
The reason
he's staying quiet,

23:00.180 --> 23:02.048
he doesn't want to see you
go to prison.

23:02.082 --> 23:04.150
He loves you too much
for that.

23:04.184 --> 23:07.754
He'd rather spend the rest
of his life in jail

23:07.788 --> 23:09.756
than see you get hurt.

23:09.790 --> 23:13.126
I don't see you
as some kind of monster.

23:13.159 --> 23:17.731
A boy finds out his dad's
got this sick sexual fetish,

23:17.764 --> 23:20.166
it's got to be devastating,

23:20.200 --> 23:22.168
doing what he was doing,

23:22.202 --> 23:24.771
and when you went
to the office

23:24.805 --> 23:27.173
and saw the woman,
I don't know.

23:27.207 --> 23:31.177
Any kid would probably go
a little nuts inside,

23:31.211 --> 23:33.780
and the court would
understand this, Steven.

23:33.814 --> 23:35.415
They would.

23:46.226 --> 23:49.195
However angry
you might be at your dad,

23:49.229 --> 23:51.197
you're going
to be more angry

23:51.231 --> 23:52.799
at yourself one day

23:52.833 --> 23:54.801
if you let him go
to prison forever.

23:54.835 --> 23:56.870
The fact that
he's willing to do it,

23:56.903 --> 23:59.105
that shows how much
he loves you.

23:59.139 --> 24:01.474
The fact
that you got so hurt

24:01.508 --> 24:02.843
by his fetish thing,

24:02.876 --> 24:05.579
that shows how much
you love him.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.481
I've known you practically
your whole life.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.852
You're a good kid,
a great kid.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.486
You'll destroy yourself

24:13.520 --> 24:16.122
if you don't correct
what's happened here.

24:16.156 --> 24:18.859
He's sick. He's sick.

24:18.892 --> 24:21.027
I know he is,

24:21.061 --> 24:23.597
and we got to get him
some help,

24:23.630 --> 24:27.601
but first we got to
get him out of jail.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.736
Will you help me do that?

24:31.538 --> 24:32.806
Oh.

24:45.886 --> 24:48.154
You and me roommates?

24:48.188 --> 24:49.823
Lindsay said you needed one,

24:49.856 --> 24:51.224
I'm looking at the moment,

24:51.257 --> 24:53.827
and I thought maybe
on a temporary basis --

24:54.547 --> 24:59.866
Eleanor, do you think
you and I are compatible?

24:59.900 --> 25:01.267
Well, why wouldn't we be?

25:02.903 --> 25:07.574
Well don't get me wrong I like
to have fun during off hours, I
love to, but,

25:09.141 --> 25:15.015
 I just have this vision of
you doing drugs or I guess I'd
had to have you arrested.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.851
-You think I do drugs?
-No, no I don't but.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.019
I have this notion

25:19.052 --> 25:20.887
of you traveling
in underground circles.

25:20.921 --> 25:23.256
Well, Helen, I wish I did.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.858
But, unfortunately,
I work all day

25:24.891 --> 25:27.861
and I come home
and I work all night,

25:27.894 --> 25:29.863
and really,
I'm less fun that Lindsay.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.932
Nobody's less fun
than Lindsay.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.800
I heard that.

25:33.834 --> 25:36.169
You think Eleanor and I
are a good match?

25:38.338 --> 25:39.172
Well...

25:39.205 --> 25:40.907
Look she dates men
who cut off heads.

25:40.941 --> 25:42.108
I have this thin
little neck.

25:42.142 --> 25:43.977
Okay, that's really funny.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.279
See, you're already
bickering -- roommates.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.949
Helen, the judge
is coming back.

25:54.655 --> 25:57.624
Ms. Gamble is correct
in her assertion.

25:57.658 --> 26:01.027
We cannot know what was
in officer Henderson's mind

26:01.061 --> 26:02.629
when she searched that trunk,

26:02.663 --> 26:05.065
but the court
is certainly entitled

26:05.098 --> 26:06.633
to exercise
common sense together

26:06.667 --> 26:08.068
with the benefit
of experience

26:08.101 --> 26:09.636
when making its guess.

26:09.670 --> 26:11.638
She was suspicious
of the driver.

26:11.672 --> 26:13.073
She admitted as much.

26:13.106 --> 26:15.742
The search of the trunk
in the court's opinion

26:15.776 --> 26:18.178
was a result
of that suspicion,

26:18.211 --> 26:20.814
and while granted
that suspicion

26:20.847 --> 26:23.216
turned out to be
extremely well founded,

26:23.249 --> 26:28.054
it was nevertheless
legally unreasonable.

26:28.088 --> 26:30.056
The contents of the trunk
are suppressed.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.958
The defendant's
ensuing confession

26:31.992 --> 26:33.694
is therefore
also suppressed

26:33.727 --> 26:36.096
as a fruit
of a poisonous tree.

26:36.129 --> 26:38.364
Ms. Gamble...

26:38.398 --> 26:40.300
I'm as disappointed
as you are.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.268
This is awful,

26:42.302 --> 26:45.138
but we both know
it's not even a close call.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.407
If you can get
new evidence, refile,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.009
so long as it's independent.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.410
Otherwise...

26:50.443 --> 26:53.379
Congratulations,
Mr. Stanton.

26:53.413 --> 26:55.949
For now,
you get away with murder.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.618
Adjourned.

27:11.164 --> 27:12.699
I don't believe it.

27:12.733 --> 27:15.936
I would hope you get
some counseling, Pierce.

27:15.969 --> 27:17.337
It doesn't seem right

27:17.370 --> 27:20.106
I can just walk out
totally free.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.242
I wouldn't book yourself
on "Larry King."

27:22.275 --> 27:25.679
What are you waiting for,
somebody to say,

27:25.712 --> 27:28.248
"chin up,
don't feel so bad"?

27:28.281 --> 27:30.851
You should feel bad.
You made a terrible mistake.

27:30.884 --> 27:32.886
If I hadn't
opened up that trunk,

27:32.919 --> 27:35.722
we might never have known
a murder even happened.

27:35.756 --> 27:38.091
Maybe, but because you did
open up that trunk,

27:38.124 --> 27:40.426
you pretty much guaranteed
his getting away with it.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.963
You've never made a mistake,
Ms. Gamble?

27:42.996 --> 27:45.165
No.

27:45.198 --> 27:48.301
I'm going to go home
and check on her.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.136
You know how she is
about losing.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.038
I should probably
check up on Stanton.

27:52.072 --> 27:54.875
He hasn't even begun to deal
with losing his wife.

27:54.908 --> 27:56.442
How are you?

27:56.476 --> 27:58.011
Me? I'm okay. Why?

27:58.044 --> 28:00.080
I don't know what's worse,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.247
the fact that we freed
another murderer

28:01.281 --> 28:04.685
or the fact that it doesn't
really bother us anymore.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.854
You know what I don't care.

28:07.888 --> 28:09.089
If I broke
lawyer-client privilege,

28:09.122 --> 28:10.490
I can live with it.

28:10.524 --> 28:12.492
The issue isn't
whether you care.

28:12.526 --> 28:14.861
You guys are trying
to make me feel bad.

28:14.895 --> 28:16.630
I'm not gonna to feel bad.

28:16.663 --> 28:21.835
If I violated some precious
lawyer rule, tough. I wasn't
about to let some innocent man--

28:21.868 --> 28:22.803
Privilege isn't just
some precious lawyer rule.

28:22.836 --> 28:25.005
I left you out of it.

28:25.038 --> 28:27.741
You didn't leave any
of us out of it.

28:27.774 --> 28:31.311
-Oh please.
-Hey, you did this to us,
Jimmy, to us.

28:31.344 --> 28:32.979
Well, then I'm sorry.

28:52.098 --> 28:55.536
Well, I lose my roommate,
I lose my cases,

28:55.569 --> 28:58.905
I lose my cases
to my roommate.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.076
Have you given any thought
to Eleanor?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.244
Not really.

29:04.277 --> 29:07.247
-We're still going to
see each other, right?
-Helen.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.549
Don't Helen me,

29:08.582 --> 29:10.517
I-I like having you
in the next room.

29:10.551 --> 29:12.085
I've even gotten used

29:12.118 --> 29:14.120
to Bobby being in it
with you.

29:14.154 --> 29:17.123
We're still going to
see each other all the time.

29:17.157 --> 29:19.059
Yeah. When are you
moving out?

29:19.092 --> 29:21.995
At the end of the month,
I guess.

29:27.968 --> 29:30.270
I don't want to
lose you, Lindsay.

29:30.303 --> 29:32.539
You're not going
to lose me.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.210
Promise.

29:54.528 --> 29:56.329
Anything else?

29:56.362 --> 29:58.498
LUCY: No. Everything else
can wait till tomorrow.

29:58.532 --> 30:00.601
Okay. I'm on my way
to Pierce Stanton's house.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.002
I'm just going to see
how he's doing,

30:02.035 --> 30:03.369
then I'll probably
head home.

30:03.403 --> 30:05.038
Have a good night.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.139
You, too.

30:28.128 --> 30:29.996
Where's he going?

30:35.468 --> 30:37.337
I'm not saying
I don't like her.

30:37.370 --> 30:38.539
I'm just saying you two
as roommates?

30:38.572 --> 30:40.106
What? We get along great.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.042
Oil and vinegar.

30:42.075 --> 30:44.144
I hear a phone ringing.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.912
It would just be nice

30:45.946 --> 30:47.914
to get out
of that rabbit warren.

30:47.948 --> 30:48.715
That's all I can say.

30:48.749 --> 30:51.585
Hey, Jimmy,
it's Allison Olson.

30:54.187 --> 30:56.122
Allison, what's up?

30:57.591 --> 30:59.359
Oh, my god.

30:59.392 --> 31:01.394
When?

31:01.427 --> 31:04.397
Oh, god.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.132
Where are you now?

31:06.166 --> 31:09.903
I'll be right there.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.938
Jimmy, what's wrong?

31:20.947 --> 31:22.916
Steven Olson --

31:22.949 --> 31:26.186
he just hung himself
in the garage.

31:28.121 --> 31:29.623
He's dead?

31:32.492 --> 31:34.327
Yeah.

32:42.629 --> 32:46.332
I know he was upset
by all of this,

32:46.366 --> 32:49.503
but I never, never...

32:49.536 --> 32:53.707
Allison,
Steven killed the woman.

32:53.740 --> 32:56.176
What?

32:56.209 --> 33:00.747
Your husband was taking
the fall for him.

33:00.781 --> 33:05.118
I confronted Steven on it
this afternoon.

33:12.559 --> 33:15.762
-Come on. come on, come on.
-Hi, this is Lindsay.
I'm not home right now,

33:15.796 --> 33:19.499
but if you leave a message,
I'll call you back. Thanks.

33:19.533 --> 33:22.068
Lindsay, call me as soon
as you get this.

33:22.102 --> 33:24.070
I just saw our little friend
Pierce Stanton

33:24.104 --> 33:25.506
go into
officer Henderson's home.

33:25.539 --> 33:28.074
I think they pulled off
the perfect crime.

33:28.108 --> 33:29.510
-You killed my son.
-Henry.

33:29.543 --> 33:31.444
You killed my son!

33:31.477 --> 33:33.346
I didn't kill him, he took his
life out of guilt.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.480
Because you went to him

33:34.515 --> 33:38.351
after I told you
not to go to him!

33:38.384 --> 33:42.122
I know, and I'm sorry.

33:45.158 --> 33:47.227
All that's left
for me to do now

33:47.260 --> 33:49.796
is get you out.

33:49.830 --> 33:54.367
I'm going to tell the D.A.
Everything that's happened,

33:54.400 --> 33:57.671
and hopefully
we can get you out.

33:57.704 --> 34:01.642
I told you not
to go to him.

34:01.675 --> 34:06.246
I told you not
to go to him.

34:17.858 --> 34:19.492
You have one new message.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.793
BOBBY: Lindsay,
call me as soon

34:20.827 --> 34:22.295
as you get this.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.429
I just saw our little friend
Pierce Stanton

34:23.463 --> 34:25.699
go into
officer Henderson's home.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.634
I think they pulled off
the perfect crime.

34:28.569 --> 34:33.473
To store message
press save.
Message saved.

34:50.857 --> 34:52.559
This is a warrant
to search your house.

34:52.592 --> 34:53.458
What?

34:53.493 --> 34:54.327
Cynthia Henderson,
you're under arrest

34:54.360 --> 34:55.896
for the murder
of Elizabeth Stanton.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.731
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.600
You have the right
to an attorney.

34:59.633 --> 35:01.568
If you cannot afford
an attorney one will be
appointed to you...

35:01.602 --> 35:04.538
(telephone ringing)

35:04.571 --> 35:06.507
Hello.

35:06.540 --> 35:08.542
What?

35:08.575 --> 35:10.544
I'll be right there.

35:10.577 --> 35:12.212
What?

35:12.245 --> 35:14.615
The police somehow
figured it out.

35:14.648 --> 35:16.750
They just arrested
both of them.

35:20.721 --> 35:22.488
Did he leave
any kind of note?

35:22.523 --> 35:23.557
No.

35:23.590 --> 35:24.991
Well, did he admit to anyone
he killed the woman?

35:25.025 --> 35:29.162
No. He didn't exactly
deny it though either
when I confronted him.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.332
What are you asking me for?

35:32.365 --> 35:33.734
Henry didn't do it.

35:33.767 --> 35:36.737
I'm asking you
to release him.

35:36.770 --> 35:38.371
You're not serious.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.507
Of course. The guy
didn't commit the crime.

35:40.541 --> 35:43.309
You think I'm going to
release a convicted murderer

35:43.343 --> 35:45.779
on the grounds his defense
attorney says he's innocent?

35:45.812 --> 35:47.948
I expect you to
because he is innocent!

35:47.981 --> 35:49.182
For all I know,
the kid hung himself

35:49.215 --> 35:50.917
-because his father's
a killer.
-That isn't the case.

35:50.951 --> 35:52.919
Well give me evidence.
Your word of honor

35:52.953 --> 35:55.421
doesn't buy
a cup of coffee.

36:10.370 --> 36:14.675
Richard, I'm telling you
the truth here.

36:14.708 --> 36:19.412
Look, even if I did
believe you,

36:19.445 --> 36:21.447
and let's say I do, okay?

36:21.481 --> 36:23.383
I'm inclined to.

36:23.416 --> 36:25.418
I don't trust
your partners so much,

36:25.451 --> 36:27.420
but you strike me as honest.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.290
I don't have any way
of knowing you're right.

36:30.323 --> 36:32.258
Again, even if I thought
you were right,

36:32.292 --> 36:35.261
you think I've got any basis
to throw out a conviction?

36:35.295 --> 36:36.963
Even if I went to the judge,

36:36.997 --> 36:39.265
he'd throw me out
on my ass,

36:39.299 --> 36:40.701
after which my boss

36:40.734 --> 36:42.703
would throw me out
on the street.

36:42.736 --> 36:44.671
There is nothing
I can do here.

36:44.705 --> 36:46.272
An innocent man

36:46.306 --> 36:49.810
is going to spend the rest
of his life in prison

36:49.843 --> 36:52.713
for a crime
he didn't commit.

36:52.746 --> 36:55.782
Wouldn't be the first time
that happened.

36:57.007 --> 37:01.709
I'd tell you're client to think
twice before hiding the truth
from his attorney.

37:05.959 --> 37:07.894
Woman: case number 32345
and 32346 --

37:07.928 --> 37:09.462
commonwealth
vs Pierce Stanton

37:09.495 --> 37:11.665
and Cynthia Henderson,

37:11.698 --> 37:14.701
murder in the first degree,
conspiracy to commit murder.

37:14.735 --> 37:17.270
Bobby Donnell for
Pierce Stanton, your honor.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.705
Marcia Shultz
for Cynthia Henderson.

37:18.739 --> 37:20.974
Your honor,
this seems like harassment.

37:21.007 --> 37:23.476
The police are frustrated
at losing Mr. Stanton,

37:23.510 --> 37:25.378
so they've hatched a conspiracy
theory between Mr. Stanton

37:25.411 --> 37:27.047
and the officer
who searched the trunk

37:27.080 --> 37:30.584
without any new evidence
whatsoever, as fas as I could
tell on the incident report.

37:30.617 --> 37:33.319
I have to admit Ms. Gamble
I'm a little curious.

37:33.353 --> 37:35.722
We have new evidence.
I have an audio tape

37:35.756 --> 37:36.990
which I'm happy to play
for the court.

37:37.023 --> 37:38.024
Let's hear it.

37:42.095 --> 37:43.496
Bobby: Lindsay,
call me as soon

37:43.530 --> 37:44.531
as you get this.

37:44.565 --> 37:45.999
<i>I just saw our little friend</i>
<i>Pierce Stanton</i>

37:46.032 --> 37:47.768
go into
officer Henderson's home.

37:47.801 --> 37:50.771
I think they pulled off
the perfect crime.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.372
That was attorney
Robert Donnell

37:52.405 --> 37:53.740
talking to attorney
Lindsay Dole.

37:53.774 --> 37:55.742
We then went
to Ms. Henderson's home

37:55.776 --> 37:57.944
and found Mr. Stanton
and Ms. Henderson together.

37:57.978 --> 38:00.413
First of all, that tape
was a private message

38:00.446 --> 38:01.782
from me to Ms. Dole.

38:01.815 --> 38:03.950
Mr. Donnell
is not the defendant.

38:03.984 --> 38:06.052
He has no standing to assert
fourth amendment arguments.

38:06.086 --> 38:07.921
Second, it's work product --
lawyer to lawyer.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.389
This isn't work product,
it doesn't involve strategy.

38:09.422 --> 38:11.525
How did you get this tape?

38:11.558 --> 38:12.659
Lindsay Dole is my roommate.

38:12.693 --> 38:14.060
I pulled it off
her answering machine.

38:14.094 --> 38:15.929
Which is an invasion
of privacy.

38:15.962 --> 38:17.197
You're not on trial here,
they are.

38:17.230 --> 38:20.400
They cannot argue an invasion
of your privacy as a defense.

38:20.433 --> 38:21.702
I maintain
it's work product.

38:21.735 --> 38:22.769
The case was over
it doesn't apply..

38:22.803 --> 38:25.405
Quiet. Am I to understand
these two orchestrated

38:25.438 --> 38:27.908
that unconstitutional search
of the trunk?

38:27.941 --> 38:29.643
Yes, your honor.
They're lovers.

38:29.676 --> 38:31.044
He kills the wife.

38:31.077 --> 38:33.614
She as a police officer,
illegally searches the trunk.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.516
The body and the confession
are thrown out.

38:35.549 --> 38:38.552
And of course,
it would be nearly impossible

38:38.585 --> 38:40.954
for the police
to build a case independent

38:40.987 --> 38:42.556
of search and confession.

38:42.589 --> 38:44.658
End result --
they get away with murder.

38:44.691 --> 38:46.960
Well, aren't we clever?

38:46.993 --> 38:48.862
That phone message
should not be allowed in!

38:48.895 --> 38:50.831
Mr. Donnell, I had no choice

38:50.864 --> 38:53.433
but to set your client free
the last time,

38:53.466 --> 38:55.468
but here I am very much
in charge.

38:55.501 --> 38:56.837
As Ms. Gamble pointed out,

38:56.870 --> 38:58.104
your client has no standing

38:58.138 --> 39:00.073
to assert
your privacy rights,

39:00.106 --> 39:02.876
nor do I find
your little phone message

39:02.909 --> 39:04.845
to fall within work product.

39:04.878 --> 39:06.747
The charges stand.

39:06.780 --> 39:08.815
They'll be held
without bail,

39:08.849 --> 39:10.984
and that is that.

39:13.419 --> 39:14.855
I don't want to hear it,
get out of my office.

39:14.888 --> 39:17.457
Not until you look me
in the eye --

39:17.490 --> 39:21.094
I am looking you in the eye!
I wasn't about to let
those two murderers go free.

39:21.127 --> 39:23.697
I didn't think it was going
to jeopardize our friendship,
Lindsay.

39:23.730 --> 39:25.732
I thought our friendship
was stronger than that.

39:25.766 --> 39:27.500
It was a private message.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.402
And if the stakes
weren't so high --

39:29.435 --> 39:30.937
Come one Helen,
you of all people--

39:30.971 --> 39:33.607
You of all people what? Was it
a violation of trust?

39:33.640 --> 39:36.743
Maybe it was.
In the scheme of things --

39:36.777 --> 39:38.111
and you, you traded

39:38.144 --> 39:40.747
on inside information
with me last year

39:40.781 --> 39:42.115
to much more tragic results.

39:42.148 --> 39:44.484
I can't believe you could
be standing there

39:44.518 --> 39:45.952
complaining at all.

39:45.986 --> 39:48.955
Did you think I was going
to sit on that information

39:48.989 --> 39:51.424
because you're my friends?

40:10.010 --> 40:12.979
Come on.
I'll buy you a beer.

40:13.013 --> 40:15.882
I got a little more work
to do.

40:15.916 --> 40:18.985
There's nothing else
you can do, Jimmy.

40:19.019 --> 40:21.154
No, I've done enough.

40:21.187 --> 40:23.790
I should have listened
to you.

40:23.824 --> 40:27.060
The kid wasn't going to
survive this staying quiet.

40:27.093 --> 40:28.629
We both know that.

40:28.662 --> 40:31.898
He was a murderer.
Let's not forget it.

40:35.669 --> 40:37.070
I'm going to head home.

40:37.103 --> 40:39.472
If you need me, call, okay?

40:39.506 --> 40:40.941
Okay.

40:51.585 --> 40:55.188
It's so easy to play
"if I'd just done that,

40:55.221 --> 40:58.091
if I'd only said this."

40:58.124 --> 41:00.627
You'll lose that game,
Jimmy.

41:00.661 --> 41:02.929
I've put killers back out
on the street

41:02.963 --> 41:05.065
only to have them
kill again.

41:05.098 --> 41:09.102
You can only be true
to yourself

41:09.135 --> 41:10.837
and trust that.

41:10.871 --> 41:13.039
No.

41:13.823 --> 41:19.112
You can only be true
to the rules.

41:19.145 --> 41:22.716
You put killers back
on the street

41:22.749 --> 41:27.153
because the rules of law
told you to.

41:27.187 --> 41:29.723
The rules here,

41:29.756 --> 41:33.627
they said honor privilege.

41:33.660 --> 41:36.630
I broke the rules,

41:36.663 --> 41:39.165
and now a kid is dead

41:39.199 --> 41:42.168
and my client...

41:42.202 --> 41:46.272
I don't have any system
to cling to.

41:50.777 --> 41:54.180
You saw
a terrible situation.

41:54.214 --> 41:56.650
You tried to improve it.

41:58.919 --> 42:01.922
Cling to that.

42:23.677 --> 42:24.945
What if we get sued
for malpractice?

42:24.978 --> 42:26.046
You think about that?

42:26.079 --> 42:27.848
By a murderer?

42:27.881 --> 42:30.884
Yes, I'm sure the jury
will award huge damages.

42:33.253 --> 42:36.222
Maybe we can suppress
the tape as hearsay.

42:36.256 --> 42:37.858
I doubt it.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.225
Declaration
against interests,

42:39.259 --> 42:42.596
maybe even res gestae.
It'll get in.

42:45.331 --> 42:47.033
What were you thinking
anyway?

42:47.067 --> 42:48.602
-Lindsay --
-Don't "Lindsay" me.

42:48.635 --> 42:49.703
What, you're going
to attack me now?

42:49.736 --> 42:52.105
Yes, Bobby because that was
a stupid thing to do.

42:52.138 --> 42:53.039
I'm not going to listen.

42:53.073 --> 42:55.108
You know Helen retrieves
my messages for me

42:55.141 --> 42:56.042
ever since
I've been sleeping here.

42:56.076 --> 42:57.110
I call her to get them

42:57.143 --> 42:59.580
because I can't call
in myself...

43:02.816 --> 43:06.152
Oh, my god.

43:06.186 --> 43:09.923
You know Helen retrieves
my messages for me.

43:12.025 --> 43:14.127
That phone call
was for Helen.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.329
You don't know
what you're talking about.

43:16.362 --> 43:18.999
Bobby Donnell --

43:19.032 --> 43:22.202
Lindsay,
just read your book.

43:42.723 --> 43:45.726
â™ª

44:08.782 --> 44:09.816
You stinker!
