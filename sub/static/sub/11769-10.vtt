A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.033
( female )
OKAY, UH,
HERE'S THE THING.

00:16.067 --> 00:17.367
I JUST,

00:17.400 --> 00:19.467
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
DO THIS SHOW.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.100
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
DO IT ANYMORE.

00:22.133 --> 00:25.800
I'VE LOST
ENTHUSIASM FOR IT.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.767
I JUST DON'T
FEEL JAZZED ABOUT IT,

00:27.800 --> 00:31.400
AND, UM,
I'VE KIND OF HAD IT.

00:31.433 --> 00:33.700
SO LET'S JUST
WALK AWAY FROM THIS.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.333
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH
OF A HEADACHE

00:35.367 --> 00:37.667
AND I'M UTTERLY
EXHAUSTED, OKAY ?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SAYING THAT,

00:39.167 --> 00:40.533
'CAUSE IT'S SUCH
A GREAT IDEA.

00:40.567 --> 00:42.100
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:42.133 --> 00:44.667
NO, NO, I KNOW, JEFF,
I KNOW IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.300
THAT'S NOT
WHAT THE ISSUE IS.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.533
NOW, THE PROBLEM,
QUITE HONESTLY,

00:48.567 --> 00:50.100
HAS BEEN YOU, LARRY.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.667
YEAH.

00:51.700 --> 00:55.367
I MEAN, IT'S JUST BEEN
A FIASCO FROM START TO FINISH.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.233
THE TROUBLE SEEMS TO BE
FOLLOWING YOU.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.833
HE'S A VICTIM
OF CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:59.867 --> 01:02.933
OKAY, IT'S HIS NOT BEING
A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE, GUYS,

01:02.967 --> 01:04.067
AND, YOU KNOW,

01:04.100 --> 01:06.500
LAR, COME ON.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.200
THIS HAS BEEN A JOKE,
IT'S BEEN TOO MUCH.

01:09.233 --> 01:10.400
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,

01:10.433 --> 01:12.833
I'M SORRY THAT YOU
FEEL THAT WAY.

01:12.867 --> 01:14.067
IT'S A SHAME
'CAUSE EVERYONE LOVES IT.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.100
YEAH, EVERYONE LOVES IT.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.700
RIGHT, EXACTLY.

01:16.733 --> 01:19.067
IT'S WHAT'S GONE ON AFTER
THAT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM, BUT--

01:19.067 --> 01:21.400
IF WE WERE
TO CONTINUE,

01:21.433 --> 01:23.267
WHERE WOULD WE EVEN GO
AT THIS POINT ?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.400
WHERE WOULD
WE EVEN GO ?

01:25.433 --> 01:27.333
WHAT ARE OUR
CHOICES HERE, CBS ?

01:27.367 --> 01:28.967
FOX ?

01:29.067 --> 01:30.767
( Larry )
NO, NOT FOX, I DON'T
LIKE THEIR POLITICS.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.500
CBS IS WHERE I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH IT, CBS.

01:33.533 --> 01:34.833
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
COME ON, WE'LL DO CBS--

01:34.867 --> 01:36.467
IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S TIRING.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.767
THIS HAS BEEN TIRING.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.533
( Jeff )
HE'S GONNA DO IT ALL,
FROM NOW ON.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.367
HE WILL DO IT ALL.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.533
AT THE NEXT MEETING, YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE TO SAY A WORD,

01:43.567 --> 01:44.967
I'LL PITCH
THE WHOLE SHOW, OKAY ?

01:45.067 --> 01:46.233
REALLY ?

01:46.267 --> 01:47.800
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SHOW UP
AND I'LL SELL IT.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.767
JUST DIVORCE YOURSELF
FROM THE WHOLE THING

01:49.800 --> 01:51.833
UNTIL THERE'S A SCRIPT
IN FRONT OF YOU, OKAY ?

01:51.867 --> 01:55.067
YOU ARE GONNA
DO ALL OF IT ?

01:55.067 --> 01:56.133
I WILL DO
THE WHOLE THING.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.200
THE WHOLE PITCH.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.600
YEAH, THE WHOLE PITCH.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.733
COME ON,
ONE MORE SHOT.

02:00.767 --> 02:03.800
OH, MY GOD,
ALRIGHT, CBS.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.733
CBS.

02:06.900 --> 02:07.967
WELL...

02:08.067 --> 02:09.400
THAT WAS
A LITTLE DICEY, HUH ?

02:09.433 --> 02:10.800
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I KNEW WE HAD THEM.

02:10.833 --> 02:11.900
DID YOU ?

02:11.933 --> 02:12.900
YEAH.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.667
THEY NEEDED REASSURANCE,
I THINK, RIGHT ?

02:14.700 --> 02:17.067
THEY NEEDED REASSURANCE,
THAT'S COMPLETELY WHAT IT WAS.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.267
DON'T STARE,
COME ON.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.800
OH MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.467
I JUST READ ABOUT THAT
IN THE PAPER.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.300
IT'S CALLED
"SCARLET LETTER PUNISHMENT".

02:26.333 --> 02:27.400
"SCARLET LETTER
PUNISHMENT" ?

02:27.433 --> 02:29.067
POOR GUY.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.200
YEAH.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.567
HEY, LARRY !

02:31.600 --> 02:33.133
HEY, RICK,
HOW YOU DOING ?

02:33.167 --> 02:34.400
GOOD !
GOOD.

02:34.433 --> 02:35.600
YOU KNOW
THAT GUY ?

02:35.633 --> 02:40.500
HE WORKS AT
THE RESTAURANT

02:40.533 --> 02:42.100
IN YOUR HOTEL.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.633
THE "W" HOTEL.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.867
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
HELLO TO HIM, YOU KNOW HIM.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.900
I KNOW, HE WANTED
TO DO A STOP AND CHAT.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.067
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO
A STOP AND CHAT.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.333
"STOP AND CHAT ?"

02:50.367 --> 02:52.067
WHERE DO YOU COME UP
WITH THESE THINGS,
"STOP AND CHAT ?"

02:52.067 --> 02:53.600
HE WANTED TO STOP
AND CHAT WITH ME

02:53.633 --> 02:55.167
AND I DON'T KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH
FOR A STOP AND CHAT.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.833
HI, HOW ARE YOU ?
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO,
TAKE CARE, BYE.

02:56.867 --> 02:58.467
NO, IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.900
FOR HIM ALL I NEED TO DO
IS JUST SAY HELLO, AND--

03:00.933 --> 03:02.200
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
THAT WAS KIND OF RUDE.

03:02.233 --> 03:03.600
THAT WAS NOT RUDE.

03:03.633 --> 03:04.900
I DON'T HAVE TO DO
A STOP AND CHAT WITH HIM.

03:04.933 --> 03:06.867
YOU ALWAYS HAVE THESE RULES
AND THE PHRASINGS,

03:06.900 --> 03:08.367
STOP AND CHAT.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.967
LARRY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP US
STUFF SOME ENVELOPES ?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.833
UM, NO.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.067
( sarcastically )
REALLY ?

03:16.067 --> 03:18.700
THAT SHOCKS ME.

03:18.733 --> 03:20.867
OOH, GUESS WHO
I'M GOING TO SEE.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.933
WHO ?

03:21.967 --> 03:23.067
KIM.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.500
KIM NAILS
OR KIM PSYCHIC ?

03:24.533 --> 03:25.567
KIM PSYCHIC.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.633
WHAT ?

03:26.667 --> 03:28.400
YES, I'M SO EXCITED.

03:28.433 --> 03:29.867
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THAT PSYCHIC ?

03:29.900 --> 03:31.233
YEAH, TO KIM.

03:31.267 --> 03:32.667
I KEPT CALLING
AND FINALLY

03:32.700 --> 03:35.300
SHE SAID THAT SOMEBODY
CANCELLED THEIR APPOINTMENT, SO.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.833
LAST TIME
SHE WAS DEAD ON.

03:37.867 --> 03:38.967
OH, SHE'S GREAT.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.267
OH, YEAH.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.067
SHE TOLD CHERYL THAT I WAS GONNA
GET A HOLE IN ONE IN GOLF,

03:42.100 --> 03:44.100
AND I GOT
A HOLE IN ONE.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.733
WOW, NOW THAT'S AMAZING,
SHE'S ALMOST MAGICAL.

03:46.767 --> 03:49.433
SHE ALSO TOLD CHERYL
THAT I WAS GONNA
HAVE A BAD TIME IN HAWAII,

03:49.467 --> 03:51.100
WHICH I DID,
BUT, YOU KNOW...

03:51.133 --> 03:52.433
( Cheryl )
BUT THAT WASN'T SO...

03:52.467 --> 03:54.533
ONLY YOU COULD
HAVE A BAD TIME IN HAWAII.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.867
YEAH, ANYBODY COULD'VE
PREDICTED THAT.

03:56.900 --> 04:01.067
AND SHE SAID THAT
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS
GONNA GET PREGNANT, CARRIE,

04:01.067 --> 04:03.833
AND SHE EVEN SAID THE NAME
AND SHE'S PREGNANT

04:03.867 --> 04:05.567
AND SHE'S GONNA HAVE A BABY
AND THEY'RE SO HAPPY.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.367
I MEAN,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.100
( Cheryl )
HOW WEIRD IS THAT ?

04:09.133 --> 04:10.300
SHE'S SPOOKY.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.500
YOU KNOW WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT HER ?

04:11.533 --> 04:13.300
SHE EVEN, LIKE
STUFF THAT'S BAD,

04:13.333 --> 04:15.067
SHE DOESN'T
HOLD BACK.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.300
SHE'LL TELL YOU.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.967
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF PSYCHICS,

04:18.067 --> 04:19.600
THEY HOLD BACK
ON THE BAD STUFF.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.200
WHO'S GONNA PAY TO HEAR
A BUNCH OF BAD SHIT ?

04:21.233 --> 04:22.767
NOBODY WANT
TO HEAR THAT.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.600
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS ?

04:31.633 --> 04:32.800
WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY DOING ?

04:32.833 --> 04:34.967
PUTT IT.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.633
EVERY HOLE,

04:37.667 --> 04:39.567
THEY LINE UP PUTTS,
FROM THE FRONT, FROM THE BACK.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.067
THEY WALK AROUND.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.700
WHAT ARE THEY PLAYING,
FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ?

04:42.733 --> 04:43.767
I KNOW.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.333
I'VE GOT A FIVE-HOUR
ROUND HERE.

04:45.367 --> 04:46.433
WE'RE FINE.

04:46.467 --> 04:47.933
WE'RE FINE ?

04:47.967 --> 04:49.333
ENJOY YOURSELF.
I CAN'T
ENJOY MYSELF.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.100
THEY CAN'T
FEEL YOUR TENSION, OKAY ?

04:51.133 --> 04:54.300
YOU'RE JUST
ALL WIRED UP.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.667
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I GOT A MASSEUSE.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.100
THIS WEEKEND
YOU'RE GONNA SEE HER,
MY TREAT.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.667
YOU'RE JUST ALL TENSE.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.700
YOU NEED TO RELAX,
'CAUSE GOLF DOESN'T RELAX YOU.

05:03.733 --> 05:06.533
HOW CAN YOU RELAX IF THESE GUYS
TAKE A YEAR LIKE THIS ?

05:06.567 --> 05:08.100
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, SO ?

05:08.133 --> 05:09.767
MY TREAT.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.533
HEY, SORRY ABOUT THIS,
THEY'RE TAKING A YEAR UP THERE.

05:13.567 --> 05:14.533
NO PROBLEM,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.533
I'M TELLING YOU--

05:16.567 --> 05:17.733
ALRIGHT, FINE,
I'LL GET IT.

05:17.767 --> 05:20.400
( Larry )
FINALLY, THEY'RE DONE.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.833
I CAN'T HIT
IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE.

05:29.867 --> 05:31.667
YOU KNOW, I JUST CAN'T,
I JUST CAN'T.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.633
( female )
OH, RIGHT THERE,
WHAT'S THAT ?

05:35.667 --> 05:37.967
( Larry )
THAT'S A BAD SPOT.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.933
YEAH, LET'S TRY TO BREATHE
THROUGH IT, OKAY, TOGETHER ?

05:40.967 --> 05:44.900
( loud breathing )

05:48.500 --> 05:50.333
IS THAT BETTER ?

05:50.367 --> 05:51.933
NAH, NOT REALLY.

05:51.967 --> 05:56.233
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
THE BODY HAS A MEMORY

05:56.267 --> 06:00.167
AND IT HOLDS ON TO
TRAUMATIC EVENTS
FROM OUR CHILDHOOD.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.700
AND DO YOU THINK THIS
MIGHT RELATE TO ANYTHING

06:03.733 --> 06:05.100
THAT MAY HAVE
HAPPENED TO YOU ?

06:05.133 --> 06:07.533
WELL, MY MOTHER DID THROW ME
AGAINST A BRICK WALL

06:07.567 --> 06:09.200
WHEN I WAS AN INFANT,
MAYBE--

06:09.233 --> 06:10.933
REALLY ?

06:10.967 --> 06:12.100
YEAH.

06:12.133 --> 06:14.733
I DIDN'T
GET HURT AT ALL.

06:14.767 --> 06:16.933
WOW.

06:16.967 --> 06:21.933
AND HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO HER
ABOUT THIS, MAYBE ?

06:21.967 --> 06:24.167
YEAH, I'VE MENTIONED IT TO HER
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.067
SHE'S OKAY WITH THAT ?

06:26.067 --> 06:30.833
YEAH, SHE SAID
I WAS A LITTLE PRICK.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.233
HOW'S YOUR CHI ?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.867
IT'S GOOD,
IT'S DELICIOUS CHI.

06:34.900 --> 06:39.667
THE WHOLE BODY DOES BETTER WHEN
THERE'S NO BLOCKAGES ANYWHERE.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.067
I FEEL IT.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.267
ALRIGHT.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.733
YEAH ?
MM-HMM.

06:45.767 --> 06:47.433
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO FINISH YOU OFF ?

06:47.467 --> 06:48.900
HOW ?

06:48.933 --> 06:50.867
WELL, OH, OKAY.

07:01.467 --> 07:05.567
PAH, PAH...

07:07.267 --> 07:10.367
HOT...

07:11.467 --> 07:15.467
STOP, STOP.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.333
STOP, STOP.

07:17.367 --> 07:18.867
STOP ?

07:18.900 --> 07:21.467
STOP.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.533
ARE YOU OKAY ?

07:33.733 --> 07:35.867
I'M JUST SAYING IF
HE GETS SARAH JESSICA PARKER

07:35.900 --> 07:38.300
TO DO A GUEST SHOT ON OUR SHOW,
IT WOULD BE GREAT.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.467
HEY, MIKE.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.667
HEY, HOW ARE YOU, MAN ?

07:40.700 --> 07:41.733
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:41.767 --> 07:42.833
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:42.867 --> 07:45.300
ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

07:45.333 --> 07:46.333
IS THIS, UH--

07:46.367 --> 07:47.400
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

07:47.433 --> 07:48.767
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.533
WHAT IN THE GOD'S NAME
IS WRONG WITH YOU ?

07:51.567 --> 07:53.433
YOU'RE NUTS,
YOU'RE NUTS.

07:53.467 --> 07:54.967
YOU WANT ME
TO WAIT OUTSIDE ?

07:55.067 --> 07:56.600
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.900
I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS, OKAY ?

07:58.933 --> 08:00.133
OKAY.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.967
HE SENDS ME
TO A MASSEUSE

08:02.067 --> 08:06.067
AND, YOU KNOW, AFTER
45 MINUTES I'M ON MY BACK,

08:06.067 --> 08:07.700
SHE SAYS, "DO YOU WANT ME
TO FINISH YOU OFF ?"

08:07.733 --> 08:11.067
AND I GO,
"WELL, OKAY".

08:11.067 --> 08:12.933
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT !

08:12.967 --> 08:15.333
I THINK SHE'S GONNA WORK
SOME MORE ON MY NECK
AND THAT'S GONNA BE IT !

08:15.367 --> 08:16.933
THEN SHE PUTS HER HAND
UNDER THE SHEETS

08:16.967 --> 08:19.067
AND STARTS, YOU KNOW,
PUMPING AWAY.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.800
WAIT A MINUTE, ARE YOU
MESSING AROUND WITH ME ?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.067
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.133
IS THIS A GAG ?

08:23.167 --> 08:26.233
'CAUSE MY CHARACTER ON MY SHOW
GOES TO A MASSEUSE

08:26.267 --> 08:27.633
WHO WANTS TO GIVE HIM
A HAPPY ENDING.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.567
THAT HAPPENED
ON YOUR SHOW ?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.067
YOU DON'T
WATCH MY SHOW ?

08:31.067 --> 08:32.200
YOU DON'T ?

08:32.233 --> 08:33.367
NO.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.600
OH.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.467
PUT MY FOOT
IN MY MOUTH, ALRIGHT.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.767
I'M SORRY,
HOW'S THE SHOW GOING ?

08:37.800 --> 08:39.267
YOU DON'T WATCH IT,
WHY DO YOU CARE ?

08:39.300 --> 08:40.600
I'M JUST
MAKING CONVERSATION.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.067
I KNOW YOU ARE.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.967
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT
THROWING IT BACK YOUR WAY.

08:44.067 --> 08:44.967
DID YOU ENJOY IT ?

08:45.067 --> 08:46.767
I STOPPED IT.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.300
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU STOPPED IT ?
WHO STOPS A WHACK OFF ?

08:49.333 --> 08:51.167
I STOPPED IT
AFTER 12 PUMPS.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.667
NO WONDER
YOU'RE STILL UPTIGHT.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.533
YOU EITHER DO ZERO PUMPS
OR, LIKE, A THOUSAND PUMPS.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.467
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I DID IT.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.533
HOW DID YOU DO THAT ?
WHAT DID YOU SUMMON ?

08:59.567 --> 09:02.633
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DID IT.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.233
IF I STOPPED AT 12 PUMPS,
I WOULD TELL MY WIFE.

09:05.267 --> 09:07.933
I'D GO HOME THAT NIGHT AND SAY,
"HONEY, I WAS GETTING A MASSAGE

09:07.967 --> 09:10.333
AND I TOOK 12 PUMPS
AND I STOPPED,
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU."

09:10.367 --> 09:12.733
I WILL NEVER EVER,
EVER TELL HER.

09:12.767 --> 09:14.467
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF YOUR WIFE EVER FINDS OUT,

09:14.500 --> 09:16.167
YOU'RE A NOBLE MAN,
YOU MADE IT STOP.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.300
SHE'S NOT GONNA FIND OUT,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.333
ALRIGHT.

09:19.367 --> 09:22.367
OH, MY GOD.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.100
SHE'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THAT, UM...

09:25.133 --> 09:28.700
THAT PSYCHIC TODAY.

09:28.733 --> 09:29.733
THE HOLE IN ONE
PSYCHIC ?

09:29.767 --> 09:30.867
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT ?

09:30.900 --> 09:32.367
YEAH.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.467
THE PSYCHIC TOLD HIS WIFE THAT
HE WAS GONNA HIT A HOLE IN ONE,

09:34.500 --> 09:36.067
AND HE DID.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.067
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A PSYCHIC
COULD KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.500
SHE KNEW HOLE IN ONE.

09:39.533 --> 09:40.700
YOU BETTER STOP HER
FROM GOING.

09:40.733 --> 09:41.733
LARRY, GOOD
SEEING YOU.

09:41.767 --> 09:42.967
GOOD TO
SEE YOU, MIKE.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.833
DON'T FORGET ABOUT
THE CBS MEETING.

09:44.867 --> 09:47.867
CBS, TODAY, YEAH,
I'LL SEE YOU THERE,
DON'T BE LATE.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.267
HEY, SHE'S GREAT,
DO YOU WANT HER NUMBER ?

09:49.300 --> 09:50.767
ABSOLUTELY.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.767
ABSOLUTELY.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.067
CHERYL ?

09:55.067 --> 09:57.100
YES, I'M UP HERE !

09:59.067 --> 10:00.300
HI.
HI.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.633
HOW WAS
YOUR MASSAGE ?

10:01.667 --> 10:02.933
GOOD.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.200
GOOD,
GUESS WHAT ?

10:04.233 --> 10:05.633
I HAVE MADE PLANS
FOR US TONIGHT.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.367
WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE
YOUR CBS DEAL.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.667
IT'S NOT EVEN--

10:08.700 --> 10:11.233
LISTEN, I HAVE A LIMO
THAT'S GONNA PICK US UP.

10:11.267 --> 10:15.567
IT'S GONNA TAKE US TO MOHO
FOR DINNER AT THE "W" HOTEL.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.067
AND THEN IF WE'RE,
YOU KNOW, FEELING FRISKY,

10:17.100 --> 10:19.100
THEN WE CAN STAY ALL NIGHT,
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO.

10:19.133 --> 10:22.800
I SAW THAT GUY WHO MANAGES
THE PLACE, RICK CRANE,

10:22.833 --> 10:24.733
I RAN INTO HIM
ON THE STREET THE OTHER DAY

10:24.767 --> 10:26.933
AND I DIDN'T DO
A STOP AND CHAT.

10:26.967 --> 10:30.267
HE WANTED TO STOP AND TALK
AND I JUST KEPT WALKING,

10:30.300 --> 10:31.900
BUT I SAID
HELLO, BUT--

10:31.933 --> 10:33.933
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ?

10:33.967 --> 10:38.000
IT'S TOO AWKWARD AND HORRIBLE
TO DO THOSE STOP AND CHATS.

10:38.033 --> 10:40.033
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.633
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN
GONNA RUN INTO HIM.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.233
THE DEAL WITH CBS,
WE HAVE THE MEETING TODAY.

10:44.267 --> 10:45.967
IT'S NOT A DONE DEAL
OR ANYTHING.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW--

10:47.033 --> 10:48.667
OH, COME ON,
IT'S AS GOOD AS DONE, RIGHT ?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.633
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY KEYS ?

10:50.667 --> 10:52.200
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE PSYCHIC.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.133
I'M ACTUALLY
RUNNING LATE.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.233
OH, OH, I GOT THEM,
I GOT THEM.

10:56.267 --> 10:59.300
ALRIGHT, WELL,
I WILL SEE YOU LATER.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.067
HONEY, I GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.067
WHAT ?

11:02.067 --> 11:03.067
LET'S FOOL AROUND.

11:03.067 --> 11:04.200
RIGHT NOW ?

11:04.233 --> 11:05.767
LISTEN, I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.500
FORGET THE PSYCHIC,
COME ON, LET'S FOOL AROUND.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.233
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO GET THIS.

11:10.267 --> 11:12.867
NO, NO,
NOT RIGHT NOW !

11:12.900 --> 11:15.667
NO, MEANS NO !

11:15.700 --> 11:17.933
GOD, NO, SAVE IT
FOR TONIGHT !

11:17.967 --> 11:19.500
SAVE IT FOR TONIGHT !

11:19.533 --> 11:23.667
LARRY, NO, LISTEN,
I HAVE GOT TO GET GOING.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.367
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE ME LATE.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.267
I'VE GOT A LUMP AND I'M AFRAID
SHE'S GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT IT !

11:28.300 --> 11:29.833
DO YOU HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING ?!

11:29.867 --> 11:31.833
I'M DYING !

11:31.867 --> 11:35.567
( female )
AND THAT'S THE NAME OF THE SHOW,
"AREN'T YOU EVELYN ?"

11:35.600 --> 11:38.600
I LIKE THE EDGE OF IT,
BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY,

11:38.633 --> 11:40.500
BUT IT'S
A LITTLE QUIRKY, TOO.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.167
THIS IS ALL LARRY'S IDEA,
BY THE WAY.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.733
HE CAME TO MY OFFICE
AND PITCHED IT,

11:43.767 --> 11:45.600
AND I IMMEDIATELY
JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SUPERB

11:45.633 --> 11:49.467
AND, UM, LAR,
HELLO ?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.067
HELLO ?
WE'RE PITCHING.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.500
YES, SO.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.633
DID SHE OFFER YOU COFFEE
OR WATER OR SOMETHING ?

11:55.667 --> 11:57.400
OH, SHE DID,
I DON'T WANT ANY,

11:57.433 --> 11:58.800
BUT PERHAPS
YOU'D LIKE AN ESPRESSO ?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.467
WE CAN MAKE YOU
A LATTE HERE.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.067
I'M OKAY,
THANK YOU.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.300
ALRIGHT.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.500
YOU KNOW, THE THING
THAT'S HARD,

12:05.533 --> 12:10.833
ABOUT HAVING BEEN
ON A SUCCESSFUL SHOW

12:10.867 --> 12:13.633
IS, UM...

12:15.067 --> 12:18.733
... IS THAT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S GREAT,

12:18.767 --> 12:21.167
BUT EVERYBODY
IDENTIFIES ME WITH ELAINE.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.833
OKAY, SO,
FOR INSTANCE,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.333
RECENTLY, I WAS SKIING
WITH MY FAMILY IN JACKSON HOLE.

12:25.367 --> 12:29.933
AND I WAS WEARING
THE HELMET, THE GOGGLES,

12:29.967 --> 12:32.733
THE BIG, BAGGY CLOTHES,
COVERED IN SNOW,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...

12:35.467 --> 12:38.067
OH, I SEE YOUR
HUSBAND, LARRY.

12:38.067 --> 12:40.233
YEAH, HE GETTING
A MASSAGE.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.633
RIGHT.

12:41.667 --> 12:44.067
OH, HE GETTING MORE
THAN JUST A MASSAGE.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.433
HE'S VERY HAPPY.

12:47.467 --> 12:53.400
YEAH, HE HAVING SEX
WITH HER HAND !

12:53.433 --> 13:00.600
OH, SHE PUMP 32 TIMES,
THEN WOOSH !

13:00.633 --> 13:03.067
SO, THAT IS AN EXAMPLE,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

13:03.100 --> 13:05.233
LARRY, LARRY, ISN'T THAT
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF, YOU KNOW,

13:05.267 --> 13:06.433
TRYING TO...

13:06.467 --> 13:09.567
LIKE, UM, RIGHT,
LIKE, THE SKIING THING.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.367
LIKE, WHEN
SHE WAS SKIING, UM...

13:12.400 --> 13:14.267
NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAID.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.200
I KNOW, I KNOW,
SHE WAS SKIING
AND SHE HAD THE PROBLEM.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.900
NO, NO, NO,
I SAID THAT, SO--

13:18.933 --> 13:21.900
SITUATIONS LIKE THAT ARE
GONNA COME UP ON THE SHOW.

13:21.933 --> 13:22.967
JUST LIKE THAT.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.800
SO, I'M THRILLED
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

13:24.833 --> 13:27.567
I'M A HUGE FAN
OF BOTH OF YOU, OBVIOUSLY.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.667
( Julia )
THANK YOU.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.800
AND I LOVE YOUR IDEA,

13:30.833 --> 13:32.733
AND WE WOULD LOVE

THANK YOU.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.067
NICE TO SEE YOU.

13:45.067 --> 13:46.067
( male )
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.133
HOW DID IT GO ?

13:57.167 --> 14:02.400
OH, HEY,
UM...

14:02.433 --> 14:06.367
IT WENT WELL,
I THINK, UH...

14:06.400 --> 14:08.733
I THINK THEY REALLY
LIKED THE SHOW.

14:08.767 --> 14:11.700
I THINK, UM,
I THINK THEY WANT TO DO IT.

14:11.733 --> 14:15.433
AREN'T YOU GONNA ASK ME
HOW MY APPOINTMENT WENT ?

14:15.467 --> 14:18.433
OH RIGHT, THE PSYCHIC,
HOW DID IT GO ?

14:18.467 --> 14:25.133
WELL, I KNOW
EVERYTHING, LARRY.

14:25.167 --> 14:26.633
I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.533
WHAT HAPPENED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT HAPPENED ?

14:29.567 --> 14:31.067
WHAT HAPPENED,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

14:31.067 --> 14:32.633
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN ?

14:32.667 --> 14:33.667
YEAH.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.833
WHAT,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

14:34.867 --> 14:36.200
THAT YOU'RE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

14:36.233 --> 14:39.400
I'M NOT HAVING
AN AFFAIR !

14:39.433 --> 14:42.800
I KNOW ABOUT IT,
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.333
SHE TOLD YOU WHAT,
WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU ?

14:44.367 --> 14:45.467
THAT'S INSANE !

14:45.500 --> 14:47.400
SHE SAID THAT YOU'RE
HAVING AN AFFAIR

14:47.433 --> 14:49.500
WITH A WOMAN
WITH LONG, RED HAIR

14:49.533 --> 14:50.933
AND A TATTOO
OF A STAR.

14:50.967 --> 14:54.067
I HAVE NOT
TOUCHED ANOTHER WOMAN,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.567
I'M NOT HAVING
ANY AFFAIR !

14:55.600 --> 14:56.700
YOU'RE NOT
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

14:56.733 --> 14:57.867
NO.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.633
WHY WOULD SHE MAKE UP
A STORY LIKE THAT ?

14:59.667 --> 15:02.567
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE WOULD,
MAYBE SHE'S AN ANTI-SEMITE.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.367
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.667
YOU DON'T THINK SO ?

15:05.700 --> 15:08.067
OH, I'M SURE THERE'S
SOME KOREAN ANTI-SEMITES.

15:08.067 --> 15:11.567
SHE'S NOT KOREAN.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.200
SHE'S AMERICAN.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.367
SHE'S AMERICAN ?

15:15.400 --> 15:16.500
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HER NAME WAS KIM.

15:16.533 --> 15:19.300
HER NAME IS KIM.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.867
THIS IS NOT
THE POINT.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.600
THE POINT IS THAT SHE TOLD ME
THIS WHOLE THING

15:23.633 --> 15:24.800
ABOUT YOU
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.100
SHE'S WRONG.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.467
SHE SEEMED
VERY SURE OF IT.

15:29.500 --> 15:33.467
NO, IT'S NOT TRUE,
I'M NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.733
I HAVE NEVER TOUCHED
ANOTHER WOMAN.

15:34.767 --> 15:40.633
NEVER EVER,
EVER, EVER, EVER.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.400
IF YOU WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR,

15:42.433 --> 15:44.167
YOU'D PROBABLY LIE ABOUT IT,
WOULDN'T YOU ?

15:44.200 --> 15:47.133
I WOULD IMAGINE
I WOULD.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.567
THEN HOW DO I KNOW THAT
THIS JUST ISN'T A LIE ?

15:49.600 --> 15:52.433
BECAUSE IF I JUST TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT,

15:52.467 --> 15:53.967
IT MEANS THAT I'M JUST
A TRUTHFUL PERSON

15:54.067 --> 15:56.500
WHO WOULD TELL YOU
THE TRUTH ABOUT ANYTHING.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.767
NO AFFAIR, SORRY.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.233
PROMISE.

16:03.267 --> 16:05.300
WHO'S GONNA HAVE
AN AFFAIR WITH ME ?
I'M NOT A COOL GUY.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.333
YOU GOTTA BE A COOL GUY
TO DO THAT.

16:06.367 --> 16:07.900
THAT'S TRUE.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.767
I COULDN'T DO THAT,
I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW,
WHAT WOULD I DO ?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.767
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU WOULD NOT BE GOOD AT IT.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.433
IT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS
TO EVEN PUT A MOVE ON YOU.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.200
I KNOW.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.133
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MY HEALTH, RIGHT ?

16:18.167 --> 16:20.967
NO, NO.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.500
COME ON.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.833
SERIOUSLY.

16:25.867 --> 16:28.633
I KNOW, 'CAUSE I HAD THIS
WHOLE NIGHT PLANNED FOR US--

16:28.667 --> 16:30.500
WE'RE STILL GONNA
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

16:30.533 --> 16:32.200
COME ON, I WANT TO,
WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.533
I GOT THE THING,
CBS, COME ON !

16:33.567 --> 16:34.800
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.467
OH, COME ON, DON'T LISTEN
TO THIS NONSENSE.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.467
THANK YOU.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.733
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.933
OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT,
I GOT IT.

16:53.967 --> 16:56.667
I GOT IT,
IT'S MY JOB.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.067
UM, SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW ?

16:59.067 --> 17:00.200
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

17:00.233 --> 17:01.633
YOU'RE WAITING
IN THE CAR ?

17:01.667 --> 17:03.067
I'LL BE WAITING IN THE CAR,
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.933
OKAY, WE'LL BE A COUPLE
OF HOURS, I GUESS.

17:04.967 --> 17:06.067
THAT'S GREAT.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.167
IS THAT ALRIGHT ?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.700
THAT'S FINE,
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.533
YOU GUYS
ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

17:10.567 --> 17:11.833
GREAT,
WE'RE GOING TO.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.067
YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT HERE
AND EVERYTHING ?

17:13.067 --> 17:14.067
I'LL BE FINE.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.700
OKAY,
THANK YOU.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.767
LOOK AT THE SIZE,
WHY'D YOU GET A STRETCH LIMO ?
IT'S GIGANTIC.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.367
'CAUSE WE'RE CELEBRATING,
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.533
I KNOW, BUT WE COULD'VE
GOT A TOWN CAR.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.367
BUT THAT DOESN'T
SAY WE'RE CELEBRATING.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.367
WHAT IS THIS ?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.067
A LITTLE BIT
OF A LINE.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.067
I'M NOT GONNA
WAIT FOR THIS.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.633
JUST WAIT YOUR TURN.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.500
I'M JOKING,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ?

17:33.533 --> 17:35.200
YEAH, I'M GONNA PUSH THEM
OUT OF THE WAY.

17:35.233 --> 17:36.833
WELL, YOU DON'T
KNOW SOMETIMES.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.200
WELL, GOOD EVENING.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.133
HI, SO NICE
TO SEE YOU.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.933
SO GLAD YOU COULD
JOIN US.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.067
HOW'S IT GOING ?

17:43.100 --> 17:45.433
GOOD.

17:45.467 --> 17:46.967
I'LL SEAT YOU MYSELF.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.067
GREAT, GREAT.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.433
RIGHT THIS WAY.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.500
I HOPE THIS TABLE'S
TO YOUR LIKING.

17:53.533 --> 17:55.933
VERY GOOD,
THANK YOU.
SURE, THANK YOU.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.267
MY PLEASURE.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.933
A LITTLE CHILLY
IN HERE, NO ?

17:58.967 --> 18:00.867
YEAH, ISN'T IT.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.433
THIS IS LOVELY.

18:05.467 --> 18:06.767
DID YOU HEAR
THIS GUY ?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.067
HUH ?

18:08.067 --> 18:10.267
HAVE YOU BEEN CATCHING ON
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.467
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

18:11.500 --> 18:13.333
WITH THIS GUY,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

18:13.367 --> 18:16.433
HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY
SNUBBING ME.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.367
IT'S NOT EVEN SUBTLE,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.533
THANK YOU.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.167
HI, I'LL BE BACK
FOR YOUR DRINK ORDER.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.400
OKAY, THANKS.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.367
YOU GOTTA STOP
AND TALK TO PEOPLE,

18:25.400 --> 18:27.333
LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH
INFORMATION TO EXCHANGE.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.400
"HELLO, HOW YOU DOING ?"

18:28.433 --> 18:29.667
"HOW ARE YOU ?"
"GOOD."

18:29.700 --> 18:32.300
"HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOU ?"
"GOOD, UH-HUH."

18:32.333 --> 18:35.267
"OH, OKAY, WELL,
TAKE IT EASY."

18:35.300 --> 18:36.767
ARE YOU GONNA
GET AN APPETIZER,

18:36.800 --> 18:39.233
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA GO
STRAIGHT TO THE MAIN DISH ?

18:39.267 --> 18:40.633
I DON'T KNOW.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.267
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THAT DRIVER,

18:42.300 --> 18:44.500
JUST LET HIM SIT IN THE CAR
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS ?

18:44.533 --> 18:45.833
THAT'S HIS NIGHT ?

18:45.867 --> 18:48.333
THAT'S WHY HE GETS PAID,
HE SITS THERE AND WAITS.

18:48.367 --> 18:49.333
IT'S NOT A BAD JOB.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.300
I KNOW.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.867
BUT, I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HIM
JUST SITTING OUT THERE
WAITING FOR US.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.533
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
TO HURRY, YOU KNOW ?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.600
DIDN'T YOU USED TO
DRIVE A LIMO ?

18:56.633 --> 18:59.333
DID YOU DO WAITING ?
YOU HAD TO WAIT.

18:59.367 --> 19:01.100
YEAH, I KNOW,
AND I HATED IT.

19:03.467 --> 19:06.267
I'VE DECIDED THAT THIS
IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.500
IT'S REALLY GOOD,
ISN'T IT ?

19:07.533 --> 19:11.567
THE SHRIMP IS SO GOOD,
I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.500
SHRIMP ARE GREAT, BUT I HATE
ORDERING THE SAME THING.

19:13.533 --> 19:14.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

19:14.800 --> 19:16.367
WELL, WE BOTH
GOT THE SAME DISH.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.067
WHY ?

19:18.100 --> 19:19.933
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ANY OF MINE
IF I HAD SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.800
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT DINNER FOR, UM,

19:21.833 --> 19:23.767
WHAT'S HIS NAME,
GREG, THE DRIVER ?

19:25.133 --> 19:27.133
SHOULD WE
BUY HIM DINNER ?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.800
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.667
THE LIMO GUY ?

19:30.700 --> 19:31.767
YEAH.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.467
HOW MANY TIMES ARE WE GONNA
TALK ABOUT GREG ?

19:34.500 --> 19:37.667
OH, HE'S PROBABLY
HUNGRY OUT THERE.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.233
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
ORDER A DINNER FOR HIM ?

19:39.267 --> 19:40.667
NO, I THINK IT'S
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.700
WELL, I GOT
SOME LEFTOVERS HERE.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.933
MAYBE I'LL JUST GET HIM
A DOGGIE BAG OR SOMETHING.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.633
IS THAT BAD ?

19:48.667 --> 19:51.067
I DON'T HAVE TO EAT
THESE TWO SHRIMP.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.667
ARE YOU GONNA
FINISH THAT SHRIMP ?
YOUR LAST SHRIMP ?

19:52.700 --> 19:55.367
UH, YES, I AM GONNA
FINISH THAT, THANK YOU.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.800
BOY, I'M ALMOST
FULL ALREADY.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.367
AND YOU'RE A SHRIMP
AHEAD OF ME.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT ?

20:07.500 --> 20:12.200
NO, I'M GONNA GIVE IT
TO THE LIMO DRIVER.

20:12.233 --> 20:15.467
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
YOU WANT TO FINISH IT, GO AHEAD.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.433
NO, NO, NO,
I DON'T WANT IT NOW.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.600
GO AHEAD--

20:18.633 --> 20:21.567
NO, I'M TELLING YOU
I'M DONE.

20:29.067 --> 20:30.100
HEY.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.733
HEY, I GOT YOU
SOME FOOD.

20:31.767 --> 20:32.967
OH, THAT'S GREAT,
THANKS.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.800
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.867
YEAH, THERE'S SOME
SHRIMP IN THERE AND--

20:37.900 --> 20:40.400
LIKE, LEFTOVERS ?

20:40.433 --> 20:42.933
WELL, THERE'S
SHRIMP, AND...

20:42.967 --> 20:44.167
YEAH.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.533
THERE'S SOME
RICE IN THERE.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.467
BUT, I DIDN'T TOUCH
ANY OF THE SHRIMP.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.900
I DIVIDED THE RICE
VERY CAREFULLY.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.700
IT'S ALL CLEAN,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

20:51.733 --> 20:54.300
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT,
THERE'S NO FORK,
THERE'S NO NAPKIN.

20:54.333 --> 20:57.333
I CAN'T EAT THIS.

20:57.367 --> 20:58.967
I'M SORRY,
I FORGOT THE FORK.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.267
I'LL GO...

21:02.300 --> 21:04.900
I'LL GO GET YOU
A FORK AND A NAPKIN.

21:04.933 --> 21:06.233
THAT'D BE GREAT.

21:06.267 --> 21:07.433
SORRY.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.633
THAT'S FINE.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.533
WE SHOULD'VE GOT
THE GUY A DINNER.

21:12.567 --> 21:14.467
GIVE HIM THE LEFTOVERS
LIKE THAT, THAT WAS CRAZY.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.433
HE SHOULD BE HAPPY
THAT YOU GOT HIM SOMETHING.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.867
JUST SIT DOWN,
HONEY.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.333
I GOTTA
GET HIM A FORK.

21:19.367 --> 21:22.300
I DIDN'T
GIVE HIM A FORK.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.800
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
EATEN YOUR PIE YET ?

21:23.833 --> 21:24.967
NO, I'M WAITING
FOR YOU.

21:25.067 --> 21:26.200
OH, OKAY.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.233
I'LL JUST GIVE HIM A FORK,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

21:28.267 --> 21:29.767
YOU'RE GOING
BACK OUT THERE ?

21:29.800 --> 21:32.633
I GOTTA GIVE
THE GUY A FORK.

21:32.667 --> 21:36.100
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY ?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.500
OH, HEY, LARRY,
HOW'S IT GOING ?

21:43.533 --> 21:45.967
OH HEY, THE FOOD
WAS SENSATIONAL.

21:46.067 --> 21:47.133
EXCELLENT.

21:47.167 --> 21:48.933
YEAH, REALLY
SPECTACULAR.

21:48.967 --> 21:51.900
WONDERFUL, DO YOU MIND
TELLING ME WHAT YOU GOT
IN YOUR POCKET ?

21:53.833 --> 21:55.500
A PEN.

21:55.533 --> 21:57.233
I WAS THINKING
OF THE OTHER POCKET.

21:57.267 --> 22:00.767
OH, I GOT A NAPKIN
AND A FORK.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.600
THERE'S
A DRIVER OUTSIDE.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.133
PARDON ME
FOR SUGGESTING THIS,

22:05.167 --> 22:09.300
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE WALKING OUT
WITH OUR SILVERWARE.

22:09.333 --> 22:12.333
I AM, IN A WAY,
BUT I'M NOT STEALING IT.

22:12.367 --> 22:14.067
I'M JUST BORROWING IT
FOR A MINUTE

22:14.100 --> 22:15.600
AND LETTING HIM EAT HIS MEAL,
THEN I'LL COME BACK AND GET IT.

22:15.633 --> 22:16.867
WE'RE STILL
HAVING DESSERT.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.333
I'M JUST GONNA
GIVE HIM TWO MINUTES,

22:18.367 --> 22:19.367
AND I'LL COME BACK
AND GET THE FORK.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.400
I CALL THAT STEALING.

22:21.433 --> 22:24.067
OKAY, I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

22:24.067 --> 22:27.667
YOU'RE UPSET, THE OTHER DAY
WHEN I SAW YOU ON THE STREET,

22:27.700 --> 22:29.700
AND I DIDN'T DO
A LITTLE STOP AND CHAT,

22:29.733 --> 22:32.433
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M NOT GOOD AT LITTLE,

22:32.467 --> 22:34.400
AT ARTIFICIAL
SMALL TALK,

22:34.433 --> 22:35.600
"HELLO, HOW ARE YOU",
KIND OF THING.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.133
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

22:37.167 --> 22:40.533
COULD YOU WAIT
RIGHT THERE ?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.567
WHAT ? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

22:42.600 --> 22:44.400
I'M GONNA
CALL THE POLICE.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.933
YOU'LL BE APPEARING
AT THE WEST LOS ANGELES
MUNICIPAL COURT.

22:50.967 --> 22:55.200
JUDGE KATZ.

22:55.233 --> 22:56.400
THAT'S A LOVELY
BUILDING.

22:56.433 --> 22:57.733
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE THAT.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.633
IF YOU COULD
SIGN RIGHT HERE, PLEASE.

22:59.667 --> 23:02.067
ALRIGHT, I GUESS
IN HINDSIGHT

23:02.100 --> 23:04.367
I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE LET THE GUY
EAT WITH HIS HANDS.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.800
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN,
PROBABLY THE BETTER THING TO DO,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

23:06.833 --> 23:08.567
JUST HAVE HIM GET IT
ALL OVER HIS FACE

23:08.600 --> 23:11.800
AND HAVE DOGS COME UP MAYBE
AND LICK IT OFF HIM.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.533
THAT'S REALLY
WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.700
SIR, YOU'LL HAVE
EVERY OPPORTUNITY

23:15.733 --> 23:17.733
TO PRESENT YOUR CASE
TO JUDGE KATZ.

23:17.767 --> 23:18.867
THE COURT DATE
IS ON THE BACK.

23:18.900 --> 23:19.900
OKAY.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.200
AND YOU HAVE
A GOOD EVENING.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.700
YES, YOU, TOO,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

23:27.233 --> 23:30.167
OH, GOD,
OH, THE DRIVER.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.067
SHIT, I COMPLETELY
FORGOT.

23:32.067 --> 23:34.500
I AM SO SORRY.

23:34.533 --> 23:38.500
I HAD THE FORK
AND THE GUY CAUGHT ME

23:38.533 --> 23:41.533
TAKING THE FORK
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT

23:41.567 --> 23:42.833
AND HE CALLED
THE POLICE.

23:42.867 --> 23:44.733
I HAVE TO GO
BEFORE A JUDGE !

23:44.767 --> 23:47.267
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I'M OKAY, THANKS.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.700
DID YOU
EAT THE FOOD ?

23:48.733 --> 23:50.333
NO, I'LL GET SOMETHING
ON THE WAY HOME.

23:50.367 --> 23:52.967
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I'M GOOD.

23:53.067 --> 23:54.433
I'M SORRY.

23:54.467 --> 23:59.333
SO, UH, I'LL MAYBE
CALL YOU NEXT WEEK ?

24:11.133 --> 24:13.633
THAT WAS GREAT,
THANK YOU.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.800
BYE.

24:15.833 --> 24:18.433
EXCUSE ME.

24:18.467 --> 24:23.133
I'M SORRY, I KNOW
THIS SOUNDS STRANGE.

24:23.167 --> 24:24.200
I JUST--

24:24.233 --> 24:28.133
DO YOU HAVE A TATTOO
OF A STAR ?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.900
HOW DID
YOU KNOW THAT ?

24:30.933 --> 24:34.167
WOW, YEAH, ON MY ARM,
THAT'S WILD.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.333
CHERYL, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

24:38.367 --> 24:40.067
LARRY ?

24:49.267 --> 24:50.967
( judge )
ALRIGHT, IN THE MATTER
OF LARRY DAVID,

24:51.067 --> 24:53.167
THE RECORD REFLECT
THE PRESENCE OF MR. DAVID.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.200
THIS CASE IS
HERE FOR SENTENCING.

24:55.233 --> 24:59.067
MR. DAVID, YOU WISH
TO BE HEARD BEFORE
I IMPOSE SENTENCE ON YOU ?

24:59.067 --> 25:00.700
UM, YES, JUDGE KATZ.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.967
AND MAY I SAY
SHABBAT SHALOM.

25:03.067 --> 25:08.400
WHAT HAPPENED IS SIMPLY
THAT I WAS TRYING TO

25:08.433 --> 25:10.600
BRING A FORK
TO A WORKING MAN,

25:10.633 --> 25:13.800
WHO WAS A DRIVER,
A LIMOUSINE DRIVER,

25:13.833 --> 25:16.133
AND HE HAD DINNER,
BUT HE DID NOT HAVE A FORK
TO EAT THE DINNER,

25:16.167 --> 25:19.567
SO, ALL I WAS DOING WAS
ATTEMPTING TO BRING HIM
A FORK AND A NAPKIN

25:19.600 --> 25:20.967
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
EAT WITH HIS HANDS

25:21.067 --> 25:23.933
AND GET IT ALL OVER
HIS FACE AND HIS CLOTHING,

25:23.967 --> 25:27.900
AND, UH, IT WAS ONLY OUT OF
SOME PERSONAL ANIMUS

25:27.933 --> 25:29.733
THAT THE RESTAURATEUR
HAD TOWARD ME

25:29.767 --> 25:31.667
BECAUSE I RAN INTO HIM
ON THE STREET

25:31.700 --> 25:34.567
AND I DIDN'T STOP AND HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT WITH HIM.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.667
I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE LITTLE
CHIT CHAT ON THE STREET.

25:38.700 --> 25:41.333
I LIKE TO HAVE A REAL
CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.900
IT'S TOUCHING
WHAT YOU TELL ME.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.067
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT THERE WAS AN INDICATION

25:46.100 --> 25:49.467
THAT YOU WERE GONNA DO
WHAT YOU WANTED,
WHEN YOU WANTED

25:49.500 --> 25:51.667
BECAUSE YOU FEEL
BECAUSE OF YOUR CELEBRITY,

25:51.700 --> 25:54.333
SOMEHOW YOU CAN DO THINGS
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.

25:54.367 --> 25:57.567
MR. DAVID, I NEED
YOUR HELP IN THIS.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.100
OBVIOUSLY, A FINE
ISN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING.

26:00.133 --> 26:03.100
IT JUST WON'T
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU,
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY.

26:03.133 --> 26:05.800
SO, WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT THIS COURT TO DO

26:05.833 --> 26:08.200
SO THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS
THAT I'M NOT ACCORDING YOU

26:08.233 --> 26:10.067
ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT ?

26:12.467 --> 26:19.200
I COULD WORK AT THE TEMPLE
ON SATURDAY MORNINGS,

26:19.233 --> 26:21.533
HAND OUT TALLISES
AND YARMULKES.

26:21.567 --> 26:23.500
AND YOU THINK THIS IS
A FITTING PUNISHMENT ?

26:23.533 --> 26:25.233
ISN'T IT A JOY ?

26:25.267 --> 26:27.700
WELL, TEMPLE CAN BE
QUITE GRUELING
AS YOU WELL KNOW.

26:27.733 --> 26:32.333
YOU KNOW, MR. DAVID,
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.833
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO ?

26:33.867 --> 26:38.300
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SENTENCE
THAT WILL GUARANTEE

26:38.333 --> 26:42.700
THAT YOU WILL NEVER,
EVER DO THIS AGAIN.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.533
( chattering )

27:01.967 --> 27:04.333
HI, LARRY.

27:08.433 --> 27:10.533
I DIDN'T BEAT MY WIFE.

27:12.067 --> 27:13.767
HOW'S THE SHRIMP, AL ?

27:13.800 --> 27:16.100
ARE YOU ENJOYING THE SHRIMP
FROM THE CHINESE RESTAURANT ?

27:17.100 --> 27:19.700
EVENING.

27:28.667 --> 27:32.333
THAT WAS A WATER BOTTLE
IN MY PANTS.

27:32.367 --> 27:33.933
A WATER BOTTLE !

27:33.967 --> 27:36.700
HERE'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR
"WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE".

27:36.733 --> 27:38.900
WHAT IDIOT RUNS ABC ?!

27:38.933 --> 27:41.533
BUT I'M NOT GONNA--

27:44.467 --> 27:48.600
UM, IT'S...

27:50.433 --> 27:54.200
IT'S A LONG STORY.

27:54.233 --> 27:58.567
I WAS TRYING TO HELP A DRIVER,
A WORKING MAN,

27:58.600 --> 28:01.133
SO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
EAT WITH HIS HANDS.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.900
MISS "CBS BIGWIG."
