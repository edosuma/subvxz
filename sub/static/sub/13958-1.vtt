09:44.050 --> 09:47.019
<i>There he is. Hey, Andy! Where you been?
It's an all-hands function.</i>

09:47.119 --> 09:49.519
Come here. I want you to meet Joanie.
Joanie, this is Andy Tyler.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.988
- Hello.
- My best friend. We went to Annapolis together.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.083
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, I got you one of Larson's stogies.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.287
- To our navy's next sub skipper.
- Thank you.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.595
Lieutenant! Gonna hoist up a few beers
with the enlisted boys later?

10:02.702 --> 10:04.602
- You got it, Griggs.
- All right.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.208
- <i>Mr. Tyler! Mr. Tyler!</i>
- Hmm?

10:11.310 --> 10:13.278
My mom is here visiting.
Can I bring her over to meet you?

10:13.379 --> 10:16.644
- Sure thing, Trigger.
- That's the lieutenant I was talking about.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.356
Lieutenant Tyler!

10:25.458 --> 10:29.121
Hello there, Prudence, Louise.
Mrs. Dahlgren, Captain.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.197
Where's your date, Andy?
It's not like you to arrive stag.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.893
I'm afraid I couldn't get one
on such short notice, ma'am.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.902
Captain, could I have a word with you?

10:38.004 --> 10:41.167
- Certainly. Darling, will you excuse us?
- Okay.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.207
Be right back.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.181
I didn't get my boat.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.224
I know.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.386
With all due respect, sir,
there's only one way that could've happened,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.522
and that's if you withheld
your recommendation.

11:06.632 --> 11:10.329
That's right.
I just don't think you're ready.

11:10.436 --> 11:13.928
What do you mean,
I'm not ready?

11:14.040 --> 11:18.739
Sir, I have worked my tail off on the S-33.
I'm qualified in every area and then some.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.506
- No executive officer has higher marks than I do.
- Andy!

11:23.749 --> 11:26.741
You're just not ready to take
on a command of your own.

11:29.855 --> 11:34.258
Now I've made my decision.
It's done.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.463
<i>Mr. Tyler.
How you doing, sir?</i>

11:42.201 --> 11:45.898
- Having a good time?
- Hell, yeah, Chief.

11:46.005 --> 11:50.305
- <i>How about you?</i>
- I'm looking forward to getting underway.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.809
I'm a sea dog.
Need some salt, sir.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.577
He torpedoed me, Chief.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.950
Nine months aboard the S-33,

12:03.055 --> 12:06.252
doing the best job I know how.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.553
Doing everything once
and then doing it again,

12:08.661 --> 12:12.791
just to make sure
I didn't miss anything the first time.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.197
You'll get your chance, sir.
There's other commands in the navy.

12:20.906 --> 12:25.240
You knew?

12:25.344 --> 12:27.437
Didn't warn me.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.344
Ain't my place, sir.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.511
<i>Club's secured!
Time to go!</i>

12:38.924 --> 12:41.324
- Let's go. Get out.
- Everyone out.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.918
Come on, let's go.

12:44.029 --> 12:46.190
What's the meaning of this, Sergeant?

12:46.298 --> 12:49.426
- You the senior man?
- That's right. I'm the X.O. of the S-33.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.163
These men have a 48-hour liberty pass.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.671
No, sir, not no more.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.985
What the hell are those yardbirds
doing to my boat?

13:43.088 --> 13:44.988
<i>Looks like a goddamn Nazi submarine.</i>

13:45.090 --> 13:49.083
Hey, Andy.
This is a fine navy day.

13:52.798 --> 13:57.531
They wouldn't give me five minutes
to consummate my marriage. Five minutes!

13:57.636 --> 14:00.799
- What's going on here?
- Hell if I know. Put your cover on.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.238
Yes, sir.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.936
- Mr. Tyler, call the crew to quarters.
- <i>Aye, Captain.</i>

14:06.045 --> 14:11.506
Quarters! Everybody fall in!
Let's get in formation now!

14:11.617 --> 14:14.347
Let's go! Now!
Formation!

14:14.453 --> 14:18.219
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

14:18.324 --> 14:21.225
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

14:21.327 --> 14:24.125
Captain Dahlgren, all crew members
present and accounted for, sir!

14:24.230 --> 14:26.255
Very well. At ease.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.737
I'm sorry your liberty's been cut short,
but our schedule's changed.

14:32.838 --> 14:37.298
We have two hours to get stowed for sea
and set the maneuvering watch.

14:37.409 --> 14:41.209
Mr. Larson, have your torpedo men
load the tubes with their four best fish.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.942
<i>Mr. Emmett, warm up the diesels
and line up a battery charge.</i>

14:45.050 --> 14:49.146
<i>Mr. Tyler, we have dry stores, ordnance
and perishables to get belowdecks.</i>

14:50.823 --> 14:55.590
Gentlemen, it's our turn.
That's all.

14:55.694 --> 14:59.152
Attention!

14:59.265 --> 15:01.165
Aye, Captain.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.596
- Crew dismissed!
- You heard the man! Stores load!

15:06.705 --> 15:10.971
You got six seconds to get on your
boondockers and dungarees and turn to!

15:11.076 --> 15:12.976
Mr. Tyler, is this for real,
or is it a drill?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.978
"It's our turn"--
what does that mean?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.844
<i>I thought we had a two-day liberty pass.
What's going on?</i>

15:17.950 --> 15:23.183
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Get your jobs done now.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.224
<i>All off-going duty officers,
report to the dock.</i>

15:26.325 --> 15:29.761
Captain Dahlgren, could you fill me in
on what's going on, sir?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.023
We're obviously not going
to the Caribbean Station.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.032
No, we're not.
We're going on a special op.

15:35.134 --> 15:38.695
You'll be briefed with Mr. Emmett
and Mr. Larson once we get underway.

15:38.804 --> 15:41.637
- Aye, sir.
- Andy, listen.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.731
I'm gonna need the very best
from you on this run,

15:43.842 --> 15:46.777
regardless of any differences
you may have with me.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.245
Are we clear on that?

15:49.348 --> 15:51.873
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

15:51.984 --> 15:56.944
Now go find Radioman Wentz and quietly
escort him to the materiel office.

16:03.495 --> 16:06.464
Mr. Tyler.
How are you, son?

16:06.565 --> 16:10.433
I'm fine, Admiral Duke.
What brings you up here?

16:10.536 --> 16:12.697
He does.
That's Lieutenant Hirsch.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.864
<i>He's gonna be riding your boat.</i>

16:14.974 --> 16:19.604
<i>You're not working for Sublant on this run.
Mr. Hirsch has operational control.</i>

16:19.712 --> 16:22.647
He's the boss.
Anything he wants, he gets.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.286
Fine.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.723
Is this him?

16:52.611 --> 16:53.711
Yes, sir.

17:30.049 --> 17:34.145
- <i>He'll do.</i>
- Thank you, Wentz. That's all for now.

17:34.253 --> 17:39.714
- <i>Lieutenant, prepare the boat to get underway.</i>
- Aye, sir. Admiral.

17:45.697 --> 17:48.564
Mr. Tyler, please,

17:48.667 --> 17:51.864
don't tell the other guys
I'm half German.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.870
They'll hate me.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.734
Yeah, sure thing, Wentz.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.715
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

18:03.816 --> 18:07.217
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

18:15.461 --> 18:18.089
<i>Duty Officer Lane
to the paint shop.</i>

18:18.197 --> 18:20.097
<i>Duty Officer to the paint shop.</i>

18:22.601 --> 18:24.831
You all right, Mr. Tyler?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.740
Tiptop, Eddie.
Tiptop.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.180
Wanna thank you for that liberty pass.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.285
My girl thanks you too.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.953
You're a good man, Mr. Tyler.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.459
<i>Heart's in the right place.</i>

18:49.561 --> 18:51.961
<i>Just need to give it some time.</i>

18:55.968 --> 18:58.368
Yeah, I heard about
what happened to you.

19:00.672 --> 19:04.802
That's one of the advantages of bein' seen
and... not bein' seen.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.942
You'd be surprised some of the shit
we mess-doers hear.

19:10.048 --> 19:13.506
<i>Boy, don't go droppin' my eggs.</i>

19:13.619 --> 19:15.553
Damn.
Excuse me, Mr. Tyler.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.488
Look, all you gotta do is pick 'em up
with both hands, boy, both hands!

19:22.194 --> 19:24.253
Tyler!

19:24.363 --> 19:27.332
When the hell were you gonna tell me?
I hear this from the chief.

19:27.432 --> 19:30.595
What do you want me to say?
He shit-canned me.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.602
Now you're gonna transfer
to another boat.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.867
Excuse me. Can either one of you two tell me
where I can find the exec of this thing?

19:35.974 --> 19:39.273
Yeah, that's me, mac. Move your truck.
We'll unload shortly.

19:39.378 --> 19:42.506
You'll unload it now.
Here's the manifest.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.844
- Get those crates belowdecks.
- <i>Who the hell are you?</i>

19:44.950 --> 19:49.182
Marine Major Coonan, Office of Naval Intelligence.
I'm goin' to sea with you boys.

19:49.288 --> 19:53.691
That's my luggage.
You got a problem, talk to Mr. Hirsch.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.970
- <i>Clear!</i>
- Cast off all lines forward!

20:14.079 --> 20:16.309
- <i>Cast off forward!</i>
- <i>Take in all lines aft.</i>

20:16.415 --> 20:18.315
<i>Cast off aft!</i>

20:20.018 --> 20:23.545
Rudder amidships,
all ahead one-third.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.146
<i>All ahead one-third!</i>

21:19.077 --> 21:20.635
Bridge hatch shut.

21:20.746 --> 21:23.874
<i>Engine room, secure the diesels.
Shift propulsion to the battery.</i>

21:23.982 --> 21:26.507
Engine room, secure diesels,
shift propulsion to the battery.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.518
- Main induction indicates shut.
- <i>Aye.</i>

21:28.620 --> 21:30.178
- Green board, Skipper.
- Very well.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.190
Passing the 100-fathom curve.
On course, on time, sir.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.193
Engine room reports secured diesels,
propulsion switched to battery.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.992
- Very well. All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds, aye.

21:40.098 --> 21:44.432
Mr. Emmett, take her down. Make her depth
1-5-0 feet, ten degree down bubble.

21:44.536 --> 21:47.266
One-five-zero feet, ten degree down bubble.
Aye, sir.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.603
Chief of the watch, sound the dive alarm.
Pass the word to 1MC.

21:50.709 --> 21:53.177
- Open the main ballast tank vents.
- Aye, sir, passing the word.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.681
Dive, dive, dive.

21:59.284 --> 22:01.616
<i>Sir, main ballast tank vents
indicate open.</i>

22:01.720 --> 22:05.622
- Aye. Both planes dive, 15 degrees.
- <i>Both planes dive, 15 degrees.</i>

22:07.559 --> 22:09.857
<i>All clear!</i>

22:09.961 --> 22:13.419
- <i>Decks awash.</i>
- <i>Decks awash. Aye, sir.</i>

22:40.692 --> 22:43.820
First time on a submarine?

22:43.929 --> 22:45.829
That's right.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.066
Six-zero feet.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.731
<i>Lower the scope.</i>

22:58.009 --> 23:01.445
Captain, engine room reports minor flooding
from shaft seals and brine pump.

23:01.546 --> 23:05.107
- <i>Bilge is at 18 inches and rising.</i>
- <i>Very well.</i>

23:06.451 --> 23:08.476
<i>How deep does this thing go?</i>

23:08.587 --> 23:11.522
She'll go all the way to the bottom
if we don't stop her.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.353
Normally we try not to get
below 150 feet.

23:14.459 --> 23:16.450
Any deeper, the leaks overwhelm the pumps.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.223
<i>These S-boats are antiques,</i>

23:19.331 --> 23:21.231
<i>older than most of the crew.</i>

23:24.002 --> 23:26.596
- <i>One-zero-zero feet.</i>
- <i>Aye.</i>

23:32.177 --> 23:34.077
Excuse me, Mr. Emmett.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.148
Put a pipe patch on it,
lash it with marline.

23:38.250 --> 23:42.584
- <i>The yard can fix it when we get back to port.</i>
- Aye, sir.

23:42.687 --> 23:48.319
Relax, gentlemen.
She's old, but she'll hold.

23:51.029 --> 23:53.020
<i>Last night, at 0300 hours,</i>

23:53.131 --> 23:56.999
<i>a British destroyer reported depth charging
and sinking a German U-boat.</i>

23:57.102 --> 23:59.502
However, some time thereafter,

23:59.604 --> 24:04.041
Allied direction finding stations
triangulated a coded enemy radio signal...

24:04.142 --> 24:07.339
to this position here,
near the chop line.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.244
We believe the U-boat was disabled,
not sunk,

24:10.348 --> 24:13.146
and is drifting eastward
on a four-knot current.

24:13.251 --> 24:16.311
<i>Now, French resistance
reported a resupply submarine...</i>

24:16.421 --> 24:19.720
sailed from the Lorient U-boat pens
yesterday afternoon,

24:19.825 --> 24:21.725
with engine parts and mechanics.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.319
We believe it's gonna rendezvous
with the disabled U-boat.

24:26.765 --> 24:29.996
On board that U-boat is this.

24:33.572 --> 24:37.133
- A typewriter?
- An Enigma code machine.

24:37.242 --> 24:40.973
It allows the German navy to communicate
with its submarines in secret,

24:41.079 --> 24:45.175
and our inability to decipher their messages
is costing us this war.

24:45.283 --> 24:50.152
- Mr. Coonan?
- All right, this is basically a Trojan Horse operation.

24:50.255 --> 24:55.022
The S-33 will rendezvous with the U-boat,
posing as the German resupply sub.

24:55.126 --> 24:59.028
I will lead a boarding party dressed in
Kriegsmarine uniforms to the enemy submarine.

24:59.130 --> 25:02.099
<i>We will take it by force
and secure the Enigma.</i>

25:02.200 --> 25:06.068
Any German survivors will be transferred
to the S-33, and the U-boat will be scuttled.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.833
The German resupply submarine
will arrive at the rendezvous...

25:08.940 --> 25:12.137
and will assume that the U-boat
succumbed to its wounds and sank.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.542
The Germans must never suspect
we have the Enigma.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.444
- <i>That is vital.</i>
- So it's a race?

25:17.549 --> 25:20.211
- <i>Yes, effectively.</i>
- Who's the boarding party?

25:20.318 --> 25:22.582
Well, since you're the X.O., you, sir.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.747
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson, Mr. Hirsch
and nine of your ship's company.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.883
<i>The captain, of course,
will remain onboard the S-33.</i>

25:28.994 --> 25:34.762
Mr. Coonan, our boys are submarine sailors,
not combat Marines.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.834
The boys onboard that U-boat
are sailors too.

25:36.935 --> 25:40.871
Your men'll be ready, Lieutenant.
I'll train them myself.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.907
You've come to the right boat.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.621
<i>Ahoy! Friends!</i>

27:10.729 --> 27:15.223
<i>Stop! We have many wounded!</i>

27:15.333 --> 27:19.326
Take us prisoner, please!
We'll be no trouble.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.639
<i>Give us a hand!</i>

27:37.622 --> 27:40.147
We need water... and food!

27:44.629 --> 27:46.529
<i>We just want to get home!</i>

27:51.102 --> 27:56.005
Give us a hand!

27:56.107 --> 27:58.337
<i>We have no--</i>

28:25.203 --> 28:28.536
<i>I'm telling you, she was hotter
than Dorothy Lamour.</i>

28:28.640 --> 28:32.770
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I could tell she was interested,</i>

28:32.877 --> 28:35.243
but she was classy, you know?

28:35.346 --> 28:38.406
The type of girl that wants you
to take her to a country club dance.

28:38.516 --> 28:41.679
- <i>Yeah? Like you've ever seen the inside of a country club?</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

28:41.786 --> 28:44.755
<i>Like I'd even want to, all right?</i>

28:44.856 --> 28:48.257
<i>Anyway, I can see I'm not
getting anywhere with her,</i>

28:48.359 --> 28:52.227
<i>so what I do is,
I use my secret weapon.</i>

28:52.330 --> 28:55.527
<i>I tell her about the S-26.
Does the trick right away.</i>

28:55.633 --> 28:58.898
Don't be talking about that
while we're underway.

28:59.003 --> 29:01.403
- Why? What happened with the S-26?
- Yeah, what happened?

29:01.506 --> 29:05.306
- You guys don't know?
- <i>No.</i>

29:06.778 --> 29:10.737
She was running a test dive
down off Norfolk.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.317
Shaft seal failed.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.785
<i>She sunk to 400 feet.</i>

29:16.888 --> 29:19.823
Know how much water pressure
there is that deep?

29:34.706 --> 29:37.937
Mazzola, you will be the first one
eating powdered eggs on this cruise.

29:38.042 --> 29:41.443
<i>Keep it up, you hear?</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:48.685
Come in.

29:54.492 --> 29:58.019
This is our position, Captain.
We're still bucking some pretty heavy seas.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.621
I estimate us to be
about three hours behind schedule.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.133
I told Mr. Emmett to run at flank speed
and hold off a trim dive...

30:04.235 --> 30:08.137
- until we make up the lost time.
- That's fine, Lieutenant.

30:10.341 --> 30:13.174
You're a first-rate X.O., Andy.

30:13.278 --> 30:15.178
A damn good submariner.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.845
I know the men like you.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.920
I'd give my life
for any one of them, sir.

30:23.021 --> 30:27.253
I know you would.
I'm not questioning your bravery.

30:27.358 --> 30:29.758
The question is:
What about their lives?

30:32.197 --> 30:35.098
You and Mr. Emmett are good friends.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.294
You went to the Academy together.

30:38.403 --> 30:41.395
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.498
<i>Or what about some
of the younger enlisted men?</i>

30:44.609 --> 30:47.942
You know, a lot of those guys
look up to you like a big brother.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.105
You willing to lay their lives
on the line?

30:53.318 --> 30:56.185
You see? You hesitate.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.620
But as a captain, you can't.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.783
You have to act.

31:01.893 --> 31:04.885
If you don't,
you put the entire crew at risk.

31:04.996 --> 31:09.524
<i>Now that's the job.
It's not a science.</i>

31:09.634 --> 31:14.401
<i>You have to be able to make hard decisions,
based on imperfect information.</i>

31:14.505 --> 31:18.271
<i>Asking men to carry out orders
that may result in their deaths.</i>

31:18.376 --> 31:23.871
<i>And if you're wrong,
you suffer the consequences.</i>

31:23.982 --> 31:27.474
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions...

31:27.585 --> 31:32.648
without pause, without reflection,

31:32.757 --> 31:35.817
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

31:41.599 --> 31:45.000
<i>Tell Mr. Hirsch I'd like
a word with him, would you?</i>

31:48.072 --> 31:49.972
Aye, sir.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.896
- <i>More soup, Captain?</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

32:57.008 --> 33:00.102
I wish I was going with you, gentlemen.

33:00.211 --> 33:03.271
I feel the same way you do, Carson.

33:03.381 --> 33:06.111
Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.344
To the officers and crew of the S-33...

33:08.453 --> 33:12.048
<i>and our distinguished guests,
Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Coonan.</i>

33:12.156 --> 33:15.751
- Success, gentlemen!
- Success.

33:18.796 --> 33:21.993
- Captain Dahlgren, sir?
- What is it, Wentz?

33:22.100 --> 33:25.501
<i>Chief says we've picked up
a radar contact at 0-7-0.</i>

33:25.603 --> 33:28.504
Very well. Mr. Larson?

33:44.756 --> 33:46.951
Signal lamp off the starboard bow!

33:50.161 --> 33:52.061
<i>I see it.</i>

33:53.998 --> 33:58.332
Pass the word along:
Submarine sighted off the starboard bow.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.461
- Stand by to man battle stations.
- Aye, sir.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.471
All right, here we go.
One last time.

34:05.576 --> 34:10.445
<i>Lieutenant Tyler's raft gets from the conning
tower aft. My raft gets the gun crew.</i>

34:10.547 --> 34:12.880
And no one-- no one--
shoots till I shoot first.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.145
- <i>You read me?</i>
- Yes, sir.

34:15.253 --> 34:19.087
Outstanding. Lock and load.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.099
It'll be all right, son.

34:34.572 --> 34:38.735
<i>Captain, I estimate the German resupply sub
has a 14-knot speed of advance.</i>

34:38.842 --> 34:42.040
- My latest plot puts them at 12 hours away, sir.
- Very well, Mr. Larson.

34:42.146 --> 34:46.242
<i>Captain, the boarding party's ready, sir.
Await your go-ahead.</i>

34:46.350 --> 34:49.911
<i>Put her low in the water. I wanna give
that U-boat as little silhouette as we can.</i>

34:51.856 --> 34:54.518
- <i>Sir?</i>
- Prepare to disembark the boarding party.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.525
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

34:59.764 --> 35:02.062
If this thing goes south,

35:02.166 --> 35:04.430
I will blow that Nazi boat
right out of the water.

35:04.535 --> 35:06.935
- Understood, sir.
- Very well.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.761
All set, Captain.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.770
Now you listen to me.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.363
You get them their damn trophy
and get the hell outta there.

35:43.474 --> 35:47.501
- Aye, sir.
- The boys are gonna be fine.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.339
I know they will, sir.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.084
Good luck, Andy.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.255
Godspeed, Skipper.

37:34.285 --> 37:38.779
<i>Easy, Mr. Hirsch.
We're almost there.</i>

37:38.889 --> 37:41.016
We'll bushwhack 'em real good.

37:45.863 --> 37:49.663
All right, we got 12 men topside,
three on the bridge,

37:49.767 --> 37:52.531
<i>four on the foredeck,
five aft.</i>

37:52.637 --> 37:56.004
<i>Now remember:
Both rafts need to be tied up...</i>

37:56.107 --> 37:59.201
<i>before we move.</i>

38:02.280 --> 38:04.680
Jesus H. Christ.
They got machine guns.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.148
<i>Steady, gentlemen.</i>

38:07.251 --> 38:09.151
Wait for the signal.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.734
Mr. Hirsch.

38:36.781 --> 38:38.681
Mr. Hirsch.

38:41.018 --> 38:43.179
- Hello the boat, you asshole.
- Shut up.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.993
Goddamn you, Hirsch, say something.

40:19.250 --> 40:23.118
<i>Let's go! Board this thing!
Get out of the rafts!</i>

40:26.390 --> 40:29.826
Conning tower!
Move, move!

40:33.130 --> 40:35.291
Clear the conning tower now!

40:37.902 --> 40:40.302
<i>Another one there!</i>

40:41.705 --> 40:45.004
- <i>Griggs is hit!</i>
- <i>Get him off!</i>

40:48.979 --> 40:52.540
Move, move!
Trigger, on the back!

40:55.519 --> 40:57.510
Griggs! Griggs!

40:57.621 --> 40:59.816
- <i>We gotta get inside!</i>
- Griggs!

40:59.924 --> 41:02.392
<i>Chief, Tank, come down now!</i>

41:04.128 --> 41:06.028
Ready?

41:07.231 --> 41:09.529
Quick, open it!
Fire!

41:12.136 --> 41:15.572
Tyler, let's go!
Inside!

41:15.673 --> 41:18.301
<i>Cover your men!
Go, go!</i>

41:23.681 --> 41:26.047
<i>Don't let 'em close it.
Don't let 'em close it!</i>

41:47.705 --> 41:51.436
Two, three, four, five.
Shut it.

41:51.542 --> 41:54.375
Let's go. Go!
Get down! Go!

41:54.478 --> 41:56.605
<i>Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!</i>

42:06.156 --> 42:11.617
Get off him, get off him!
Don't move, don't move! Get back, get back!

42:11.729 --> 42:14.289
<i>Just drop it! Drop it!</i>

42:23.107 --> 42:25.132
<i>Get 'em outta here!
Get 'em outta here!</i>

42:25.242 --> 42:27.802
- Did they hit you?
- I'm okay, sir.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.750
Stern team, go!
Bow team, go!

42:41.325 --> 42:43.725
I'm outta clips, sir.
You go ahead.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.626
- Rabbit!
- All right, get 'em outta here.

42:47.731 --> 42:51.599
Get 'em outta here! Let's go!
Get down! Down, down, down, down! Get down!

42:51.702 --> 42:54.796
All right, who's the captain?
Huh? Who's the captain?

42:54.905 --> 42:58.966
<i>Kapitan?</i> How about you, ugly?
You the captain, huh?

42:59.076 --> 43:02.068
Trigger, if anybody moves, you shoot 'em
right here in the forehead, understand?

43:02.179 --> 43:03.806
-Yes, sir!
- All right.

43:21.865 --> 43:24.595
<i>Hirsch, we got it.</i>

44:28.999 --> 44:31.695
Get down, down!

44:31.802 --> 44:36.000
- Down there!
- Down, down!

44:36.106 --> 44:39.132
Rabbit, check the bilge for a scuttling charge.
Give me your weapon!

44:39.243 --> 44:41.837
- <i>Move, sailor, move!</i>
- Aye, sir!

44:44.448 --> 44:47.212
<i>Goddamn it, stay there.</i>

44:49.953 --> 44:52.922
- Hirsch, I think we got the code books!
- That ink's running. Dry it.

44:55.192 --> 44:59.390
It's water soluble.
Yeah, use the blankets, use the blankets.

45:01.231 --> 45:03.859
Nothing but pipes and valves, Mr. Emmett.

45:03.967 --> 45:06.231
Bow compartment secure.

45:29.193 --> 45:32.754
Bunch of Marys.

45:34.998 --> 45:38.559
<i>How you doing? You're number ten.
There you go.</i>

45:40.037 --> 45:43.268
You having a good night?
Uh-huh.

45:43.373 --> 45:45.739
Ain't gonna be none too happy
you lost his boat.

45:45.843 --> 45:48.334
Lucky number eleven, let's go!

45:48.445 --> 45:53.109
It's your first time looking
at a black man, ain't it?

45:53.217 --> 45:55.151
Get used to it.

45:55.252 --> 45:57.948
Let's go!
Get over here!

46:30.454 --> 46:34.356
<i>All right, hurry it up.
It's gonna be sunup in an hour.</i>

47:13.497 --> 47:18.332
- Fuse is burning, sir.
- All right, she's burning! Let's get this raft loaded!

47:18.435 --> 47:21.233
Let's move!

47:21.338 --> 47:24.671
<i>Sir, we got all the prisoners
transferred to the S-33.</i>

47:24.775 --> 47:26.675
Very well.

47:33.183 --> 47:35.777
Hey, Andy.

47:35.886 --> 47:38.719
<i>Make sure you got everything!
Get it in the raft!</i>

47:38.822 --> 47:41.222
<i>Get everything belowdecks.
Let's go!</i>

48:23.400 --> 48:25.493
Everybody, belowdecks!
Get down!

48:25.602 --> 48:27.934
- Chief, take her down!
- Aye, sir!

48:28.038 --> 48:29.972
- Let's go, Hirsch!
- The Enigma!

48:35.545 --> 48:38.639
Trigger! Grab hold!

48:42.552 --> 48:45.953
<i>Trigger! Attaboy!</i>

48:50.761 --> 48:55.323
- Got it!
- Help me! Help me! Oh, no! No!

49:03.707 --> 49:06.699
-We gotta get outta here!
- There's still men in the water.

49:06.810 --> 49:09.176
- Let's go!
- Chief, there's still men in the water.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.771
Go!

49:17.688 --> 49:21.180
<i>Andy! Andy!</i>

49:21.291 --> 49:25.728
Go! Dive!

49:27.664 --> 49:29.655
<i>Dive!</i>

49:29.766 --> 49:34.032
Take her down!
Take her down!

49:35.439 --> 49:37.339
<i>Dive!</i>

49:45.682 --> 49:48.082
<i>Tyler, let's go!</i>

50:38.368 --> 50:41.565
- Chief, you find those vents?
- Everything's in German!

50:41.671 --> 50:46.404
Rabbit, get to the torpedo room. Where's the
goddamn 1MC? Trigger, get on the helm!

50:46.510 --> 50:48.705
- <i>Mazzola, take the planes!</i>
- Aye, sir.

50:48.812 --> 50:50.780
- <i>Wentz, what about these?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

50:50.881 --> 50:54.783
There's no label! Okay, those are
the aft ballast tanks vents!

50:54.885 --> 50:57.877
These are the midship vents,
and these are the main induction valves.

50:57.988 --> 51:01.048
- <i>Make sure they're shut.</i>
- Tank, I need speed!

51:01.158 --> 51:03.149
<i>Get the screws turning.</i>

51:03.260 --> 51:06.559
- <i>The lights are on, so there's got to be some power left.</i>
- I can't read this!

51:06.663 --> 51:10.394
Rabbit, find out how many fish we've got in the tubes!
Figure out how to launch 'em!

51:10.500 --> 51:12.331
- <i>Go!</i>
- I can't read this!

51:12.436 --> 51:17.840
- Go help Tank, Hirsch. Go, Hirsch!
- Find the Christmas tree.

51:17.941 --> 51:20.341
<i>We've gotta make sure
we don't have any holes in the boat!</i>

51:20.444 --> 51:23.072
<i>"Klar, klar, klar."
Wentz, what the hell is "klar"?</i>

51:23.180 --> 51:27.116
"Klar" means "clear."
All compartments secure.

51:27.217 --> 51:31.449
- White for green? No holes in the ship! Dive the boat!
- White for green.

51:31.555 --> 51:34.854
- <i>Opening ballast vents!</i>
- Opening midship valves!

51:34.958 --> 51:36.858
Opening midship vents!

51:46.103 --> 51:50.164
This is forward trim, aft trim.
These are auxiliaries.

51:50.273 --> 51:53.436
Main motor.
Auxiliary, auxiliary.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.622
<i>This is in meters.
Everything's in meters.</i>

52:09.726 --> 52:12.024
Passing 15 meters.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.063
Recommend shutting main vents!

52:14.164 --> 52:17.998
- Make it so! Wentz, get in the sound room!
- Yes, sir!

52:18.101 --> 52:20.865
- Make depth 20 meters.
- Depth 20 meters, aye.

52:20.971 --> 52:24.236
- <i>Chief, take the dive!</i>
- I have the dive.

52:24.341 --> 52:28.801
<i>At 20 meters. Bow planes at zero.
Control your depth with the stern planes.</i>

52:28.912 --> 52:31.380
Bow planes at zero.
Controlling down with the stern planes.

52:31.481 --> 52:34.609
Oh, shit.
All ahead full, sir!

52:34.718 --> 52:37.243
Batteries are flat and draining fast!

52:37.354 --> 52:40.812
<i>Mr. Tyler, I hear
the S-33 breaking up. Wait.</i>

52:40.924 --> 52:44.360
I hold a submerged U-boat, 0-1-0.

52:44.461 --> 52:46.656
<i>Real close.
Less than 1,000 yards.</i>

52:46.763 --> 52:50.130
- Goddamn resupply sub. What's our heading?
- Two-eight-zero, sir!

52:50.233 --> 52:53.066
All right, right full rudder!
Steady on 0-1-0!

52:53.170 --> 52:56.196
<i>Aye, sir! Right full rudder.
Steady on course 0-1-0.</i>

52:56.306 --> 52:59.070
Tank, starboard back full.
Rabbit, get back to me.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.235
Starboard back full.
Aye, sir.

53:06.783 --> 53:09.877
- Watch your depth. She'll squat.
- Rabbit!

53:12.088 --> 53:14.784
We got four fish. Tubes are flooded,
but I can't open the doors until I'm equalized.

53:14.891 --> 53:17.792
- <i>I can't find the valve!</i>
- Wentz, help Rabbit!

53:17.894 --> 53:21.557
Enemy submarine close aboard.
Torpedo in the water. Torpedo in the water!

53:21.665 --> 53:23.758
All right, belay that.
Wentz, stay where you are!

53:23.867 --> 53:25.960
Hirsch, hotfoot it to the torpedo room!

53:28.805 --> 53:31.433
- Helm, mark your head every ten degrees.
- Aye, sir.

53:31.541 --> 53:35.272
- Now passing 3-2-0.
- Turn, baby, turn. Turn!

53:37.414 --> 53:41.976
Equalizing valves. Holy shit! What's what?
This is crazy. I can't equalize the tubes!

53:42.085 --> 53:44.076
What do you need?

53:44.187 --> 53:46.712
- Equalizing valves! Equalizing valves!
- Valve?

53:46.823 --> 53:50.589
- Gyro?
- No, drainage. Drainage. No.

53:50.694 --> 53:53.288
Now passing 0-0-0.

53:53.396 --> 53:56.832
Swing, you bastard, swing.

53:56.933 --> 53:59.663
<i>Chief, stand by in case
we have to flood forward trim.</i>

54:04.941 --> 54:07.808
- Impulse? Differential-- Pressure differential?
- No.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.811
- Turn 'em! Yes, turn 'em!
- Which way?

54:09.913 --> 54:12.746
Counterclockwise.

54:20.357 --> 54:22.450
Torpedo missed.
It's in our baffles.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.321
Two more torpedoes in the water!

54:27.430 --> 54:31.696
<i>Best bearing to the U-boat: 0-1-0.</i>

54:31.801 --> 54:33.826
Aye, Rabbit, get ready
to fire a spread.

54:33.937 --> 54:37.464
<i>Tubes one and two.
Zero gyro. Fire!</i>

54:37.574 --> 54:39.769
Rabbit, fire!

54:41.745 --> 54:43.838
What's going on?

54:43.947 --> 54:47.405
- What is that?
- Wrong one! The fish is stuck!

54:47.517 --> 54:51.453
- <i>We missed an interlock.</i>
- Rabbit, get those fish out before they blow!

54:51.554 --> 54:53.545
Look for "impulse air" or "firing air."

54:53.657 --> 54:56.524
That was "impulse" there and there!

55:00.163 --> 55:03.997
One, two, away.
Lining up tubes three and four.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.534
Three and four, fire!

55:12.809 --> 55:15.539
All fish running hot,
straight and normal.

55:44.541 --> 55:46.441
I think they all missed, sir.

56:00.457 --> 56:02.049
Shit.

56:07.130 --> 56:10.293
<i>U-boat's breaking up!</i>

56:10.400 --> 56:13.198
I hear bulkheads collapsing.

56:16.806 --> 56:18.706
The 33 boat, Mr. Tyler.

56:26.116 --> 56:28.516
Let's take her up
and look for survivors, Chief.

56:28.618 --> 56:30.882
- <i>Give me some rise on the planes!</i>
- <i>Rise on the planes, aye.</i>

56:30.987 --> 56:32.887
<i>Deploy main ballast!</i>

56:54.010 --> 56:56.740
Gotcha.

57:17.567 --> 57:19.467
Oh, crap.

57:26.409 --> 57:29.640
<i>Help!</i>

57:29.746 --> 57:31.976
Help!

57:32.081 --> 57:34.743
<i>Please! Help!</i>

57:34.851 --> 57:36.785
Help! Help!

58:12.989 --> 58:15.890
Do you speak English?

58:15.992 --> 58:18.825
<i>English. Do you speak English?</i>

58:18.928 --> 58:23.126
What's your rank?
What do you do?

58:23.233 --> 58:26.532
<i>What's your job? Your job.</i>

58:26.636 --> 58:30.128
"Job."

58:35.445 --> 58:41.008
You're an electrician. Good. You can us help
squeeze more juice out of them batteries.

58:43.586 --> 58:45.486
Sir, I see the skipper.

58:59.302 --> 59:01.916
Battery's dead.

59:01.951 --> 59:04.531
Whatever juice was left
we used up when we maneuvered.

59:04.641 --> 59:06.541
What about the diesels?

59:06.643 --> 59:09.874
<i>Starboard's a wreck.
We need the dry dock to fix it.</i>

59:09.979 --> 59:12.880
Port side diesel's the good news.
Whoever the Krauts had on it...

59:12.982 --> 59:15.348
didn't know a piston head
from his sister's titty.

59:15.451 --> 59:17.351
I think I can fix it.

59:17.453 --> 59:21.082
Okay, Tank.
Do what you can.

59:21.190 --> 59:23.090
Yes, sir.

59:24.494 --> 59:26.621
<i>All right. Listen up.</i>

59:26.729 --> 59:29.789
We've decided on a course.

59:29.899 --> 59:31.799
We're headin' for England, Land's End.

59:31.901 --> 59:36.099
<i>It's the closest,
besides occupied France.</i>

59:36.205 --> 59:38.105
<i>Rabbit, how many torpedoes do we have?</i>

59:38.207 --> 59:42.906
Just one. It's in the stern tube,
which is busted, bleedin' air from somewhere.

59:43.012 --> 59:46.607
- Sir?
- Yeah, what is it, Trigger?

59:46.716 --> 59:49.048
Can't we just use the radio--

59:49.152 --> 59:51.313
fire off a Mayday
and wait for a rescue?

59:51.421 --> 59:53.321
<i>That's impossible.</i>

59:53.423 --> 59:56.415
If we transmit, the Germans will
direction-find our position to a grid...

59:56.526 --> 59:58.824
with their missing two U-boats.

59:58.928 --> 01:00:02.625
If they even suspect we have the Enigma,
they will change their entire coding system.

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:06.099
<i>And that would completely negate
the purpose of our mission.</i>

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.136
Mr. Tyler,

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.137
if we head for England,

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:12.264
we're gonna go straight
through the western approaches.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:18.245
- <i>He's right. I mean, that's Jerry's backyard.</i>
- <i>Listen, guys.</i>

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:21.283
- It's full of U-boats.
- And we've got nothing to defend ourselves with.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.649
Do you think I got all the answers here?

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:28.781
Think I know how we're gonna get out of this?
I don't. I don't know how.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:32.622
- I say we use the radio.
- Nobody asked you.

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:35.630
- We use the radio and take our chances.
- I said can it.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.030
- It's what the captain would have done--
- Captain's dead.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:01.108
<i>This is crazy.</i>

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.242
<i>This whole thing is crazy--</i>

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.684
<i>riskin' our lives
over a typewriter.</i>

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:09.690
- <i>It's not a typewriter.</i>
- The hell it ain't. It's got buttons like a typewriter.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:14.729
- <i>Yeah, well, it's not.</i>
- <i>Whatever it is, it's crazy we get killed over it.</i>

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.026
<i>The navy says it's important,
it's important.</i>

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:21.069
The navy says it's more important
than you, him, me, fine.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.139
We're gonna die trying.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.368
And that ain't crazy.
That's our job.

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:32.879
What I don't understand, Chief,
is how come you're not in charge?

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:36.509
Scuttlebutt is Dahlgren was kicking Tyler
out of the navy anyway, and--

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.784
<i>You stow that shit right now, sailor.</i>

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:45.953
<i>Lieutenant Tyler is your commanding officer,
and you will respect that man as such.</i>

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.997
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Chief.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.675
Look at them sons of bitches.

01:03:41.248 --> 01:03:43.375
<i>You know my pop was a fisherman?</i>

01:03:43.484 --> 01:03:48.217
<i>He had this old 60-footer
he'd run all over the gulf.</i>

01:03:48.322 --> 01:03:51.587
Noisy two-stroke diesel.

01:03:51.692 --> 01:03:53.785
Rotten to the gunnels, that thing.

01:03:53.894 --> 01:03:58.729
<i>I could scrub that deck three times a day,
and it still stunk like fish.</i>

01:03:58.832 --> 01:04:03.326
And I swore I'd never skipper
a boat like that, Chief.

01:04:05.105 --> 01:04:08.040
<i>Hmm, I saw myself...</i>

01:04:08.142 --> 01:04:10.633
<i>standin' on the bridge
of a battleship.</i>

01:04:12.846 --> 01:04:15.144
A real sea captain.

01:04:15.249 --> 01:04:17.877
Mr. Tyler, permission to speak freely?

01:04:19.186 --> 01:04:21.245
Of course, Chief.

01:04:21.355 --> 01:04:24.051
This is the navy,

01:04:24.158 --> 01:04:27.821
where a commanding officer
is a mighty and terrible thing--

01:04:27.928 --> 01:04:29.828
a man to be feared and respected.

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:33.661
<i>All knowing, all powerful.</i>

01:04:33.767 --> 01:04:37.430
Don't you dare say what you said to the boys
back there again-- "I don't know."

01:04:37.538 --> 01:04:42.373
Those three words will kill a crew,
dead as a depth charge.

01:04:42.476 --> 01:04:44.535
You're the skipper now,

01:04:44.645 --> 01:04:48.513
and the skipper always knows what to do,
whether he does or not.

01:04:52.386 --> 01:04:55.583
- <i>Aircraft off the port bow!</i>
- Shit!

01:05:06.133 --> 01:05:09.068
<i>Real sorry, sir.
It dropped right out of the clouds.</i>

01:05:09.169 --> 01:05:11.535
<i>Rabbit, Trigger,
stand by the flak gun.</i>

01:05:11.638 --> 01:05:13.799
- Sir.
- Sir.

01:05:13.907 --> 01:05:17.570
It's German.
Looks like long-range reconnaissance.

01:05:17.678 --> 01:05:21.239
<i>What the hell's it doing
way out here?</i>

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.184
- Jesus, here it comes.
- All right. Sit tight.

01:05:29.289 --> 01:05:33.055
As far as he knows, we're all playing
on the same team. Everybody wave.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.651
Wave?

01:05:35.763 --> 01:05:38.823
Sir, we're sittin' ducks. If we shoot first,
we can blow 'em out of the sky.

01:05:38.932 --> 01:05:43.733
<i>We miss, he's gonna radio us in.
That plane's gonna be the least of our problems.</i>

01:05:43.837 --> 01:05:45.805
This is crazy.
You're gonna get us killed.

01:05:55.215 --> 01:05:59.174
He's comin' around.
He's comin' around!

01:06:03.957 --> 01:06:05.948
He's attacking!
Rabbit, do something!

01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:08.493
- Mazzola, shut up. Rabbit, ignore him.
- Do something!

01:06:08.595 --> 01:06:11.655
<i>He's coming straight for us!
He's coming right at us! Do something!</i>

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:14.063
- Acknowledge me, Seaman Parker.
- What are you waiting for?

01:06:14.168 --> 01:06:16.659
- Yeah, Rabbit! Shoot him!
- Seamen Parker, I'm ordering you!

01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:19.432
Do not fire that weapon!
Get your finger off that trigger!

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.940
Pull the trigger!
Pull the trigger!

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:24.101
We're gonna die!
Do it! Do it!

01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:27.305
Come on!
Goddamn it, can't you see him?

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.280
What the hell are you doin', huh?

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:38.984
This is not a goddamn democracy!

01:06:41.328 --> 01:06:44.229
Mr. Tyler, I see a mast on the horizon!

01:06:48.468 --> 01:06:51.494
<i>Shit! That's a Nazi destroyer.</i>

01:06:51.605 --> 01:06:55.541
That plane must have been runnin'
a recon screen for it.

01:06:55.642 --> 01:06:59.442
Clear the bridge!
Chief, secure the diesel and dive the ship!

01:06:59.546 --> 01:07:01.946
Dive the ship!
Aye, sir!

01:07:58.372 --> 01:08:02.536
We don't have a green board.
The engine room's not ready.

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.543
Vents won't open.
We lost hydraulics.

01:08:04.645 --> 01:08:08.513
<i>Tank, secure the diesel
and rig the engine room for dive!</i>

01:08:08.615 --> 01:08:11.812
Tank, acknowledge!

01:08:11.919 --> 01:08:15.320
Goddamn it! Mazzola, go see
what the hell's going on back there.

01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:27.453
Drop it, you Nazi son of a bitch!
Drop it!

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:40.336
Goddamn it.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.567
I'm real sorry, Mr. Tyler.

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:45.542
Took me right off my feet.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:48.170
Listen to me.
You've got to secure the diesel.

01:09:48.281 --> 01:09:51.011
And find out why the vent valves
won't open now!

01:09:51.118 --> 01:09:53.551
- Yes, sir.
- Goddamn it!

01:09:53.653 --> 01:09:56.383
Eddie, get this son of a bitch out of here.
Chain him to the bunks.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:10:00.927
<i>Make sure his hands and feet are secure.
Put him into submission!</i>

01:10:01.028 --> 01:10:04.156
- <i>Lieutenant, we have a problem!</i>
- Take care of it, Eddie.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:14.099
Oh, shit.

01:10:22.582 --> 01:10:25.710
Tell Tank to finish those repairs.
The destroyer is sending a launch.

01:10:25.819 --> 01:10:28.151
He needs five minutes, Mr. Tyler!

01:10:28.255 --> 01:10:30.450
<i>We don't have five minutes, Chief.</i>

01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:33.856
Lieutenant, the deck cannon--
If we fire a shell below the water line--

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.693
<i>It wouldn't do a goddamn thing.
No, that tub could take a hundred shells.</i>

01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:41.734
What we need is a working torpedo,
which we do not have.

01:10:41.835 --> 01:10:45.532
Trigger, stand by on the flak gun. When I
give the word, turn that launch into driftwood.

01:10:45.639 --> 01:10:49.439
- Yes, sir.
- Gonna find out who we are in about 60 seconds.

01:10:54.514 --> 01:10:58.610
Trigger, ready on that weapon?
Chief, tell Tank he has one minute...

01:10:58.718 --> 01:11:01.084
and get Wentz and Rabbit up here
with the machine gun.

01:11:03.023 --> 01:11:05.821
<i>Hirsch, what happens when they find out
we're not German?</i>

01:11:05.926 --> 01:11:09.225
<i>After they shoot us as spies,
they'll radio into headquarters.</i>

01:11:09.329 --> 01:11:12.127
They'll tell them
the Enigma's been compromised.

01:11:13.867 --> 01:11:17.462
What if we take out their radio,
before they can notify anyone about us?

01:11:17.571 --> 01:11:20.938
- How?
- With that deck gun.

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:24.067
<i>It's gonna be one hell of a shot,
but we can do it.</i>

01:11:24.177 --> 01:11:27.476
Then we dive like hell,
and we get under them quick.

01:11:27.581 --> 01:11:31.915
We lure 'em a little bit closer to the continent,
in range of Allied air cover.

01:11:32.018 --> 01:11:35.886
- Then we call in an air strike.
- Yeah, we call in an air strike.

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:40.216
Son of a bitch cut off
pressure to the hydraulics.

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:42.727
We need to find the stop valve.

01:11:48.235 --> 01:11:49.759
Damn!

01:11:52.706 --> 01:11:56.198
See that structure topside
with the big antenna sticking out of it?

01:11:56.309 --> 01:11:58.834
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- <i>That's the radio shack.</i>

01:11:58.945 --> 01:12:03.177
You and Wentz get on the deck. On my command,
put a shell right through the porthole.

01:12:05.318 --> 01:12:09.550
- Get to it, gentlemen. Get to it.
- Yes, sir!

01:12:27.774 --> 01:12:30.868
Tell them to go away, Mr. Hirsch.

01:12:41.821 --> 01:12:45.587
- Talk to me, Rabbit!
- Deck gun manned and ready in all respects, sir!

01:12:45.692 --> 01:12:47.751
Fire!

01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:04.772
Clear the deck!

01:13:04.878 --> 01:13:07.244
All right.

01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:25.258
Come on!

01:13:31.238 --> 01:13:34.696
Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive!

01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:51.579
- Come on. Why aren't we diving?
- Repairs aren't complete, sir.

01:13:51.691 --> 01:13:54.285
- Eddie, man the planes. Tank, all ahead full.
- <i>Aye, sir!</i>

01:13:54.394 --> 01:13:57.591
- Aye, sir! Manning planes!
- <i>All ahead full, aye!</i>

01:13:57.697 --> 01:14:01.633
<i>Nice shot, Rabbit.
That radio's history.</i>

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.774
Come on.

01:14:11.611 --> 01:14:14.409
- We're heading right towards them.
- That's right.

01:14:14.514 --> 01:14:17.347
Their deck guns can't get to us
if we're in close enough.

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:20.647
Let's hope we can dive
and clear her keel.

01:14:34.167 --> 01:14:37.534
That's it.
Hydraulics restored!

01:14:37.637 --> 01:14:40.367
Thank you, Tank.
That did it. We're going under.

01:14:50.483 --> 01:14:53.350
Passing five meters.

01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:04.320
Passing ten meters.

01:15:10.904 --> 01:15:13.304
Fifteen meters.

01:15:41.134 --> 01:15:43.398
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

01:16:17.737 --> 01:16:20.467
<i>Trigger, left full rudder.</i>

01:16:24.644 --> 01:16:26.544
Tank, all ahead two-thirds.

01:16:35.855 --> 01:16:37.755
Contact maneuvering.

01:16:41.528 --> 01:16:43.655
<i>Heavy cavitation.</i>

01:16:45.565 --> 01:16:48.932
- Splashes.
- Shit.

01:18:01.241 --> 01:18:04.369
Step away from that bulkhead,
Mr. Hirsch.

01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:09.005
The shock wave from one of these explosions
can snap your spine.

01:18:15.355 --> 01:18:18.518
Chief, you ever been depth charged?

01:18:19.626 --> 01:18:23.221
Once, off Murmansk,

01:18:23.329 --> 01:18:25.593
back in World War I.

01:18:25.698 --> 01:18:30.533
One charge came so close, it rattled
four teeth out of the skipper's head.

01:18:41.614 --> 01:18:43.514
Wasn't even close.

01:18:50.657 --> 01:18:53.592
Control, starboard E-motor's seized up.

01:18:53.693 --> 01:18:56.161
<i>The German must have sabotaged it.</i>

01:18:56.262 --> 01:18:58.162
Goddamn it.

01:19:01.067 --> 01:19:05.663
There's no way we make it to Allied air cover
creepin' along on one shaft.

01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:13.539
Get down!

01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:05.079
Eddie, help Chief.

01:21:06.192 --> 01:21:08.092
Ye-Yes, sir.

01:21:15.635 --> 01:21:18.331
Mr. Chief, I got that.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.739
Tank... you alive back there?

01:21:25.011 --> 01:21:26.945
Yes, sir.

01:21:27.046 --> 01:21:31.676
Good. Port ahead two-thirds.

01:21:33.119 --> 01:21:36.179
<i>Port ahead two-thirds.
Aye, sir.</i>

01:22:01.948 --> 01:22:05.782
Tank... can you fix the stern tube?

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.784
I don't know, Mr. Tyler.

01:22:09.889 --> 01:22:12.790
I don't want an "I don't know."

01:22:12.892 --> 01:22:17.625
Can you fix the torpedo tube?
Yes... or no?

01:22:19.465 --> 01:22:22.298
Yes, sir.
I think I can.

01:22:22.401 --> 01:22:24.301
Thank you, Tank.

01:22:24.403 --> 01:22:28.339
Chief, make depth 1-6-0 meters.

01:22:30.877 --> 01:22:33.971
That's more than 500 feet.

01:22:36.616 --> 01:22:38.516
<i>Take us down, Chief.</i>

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.481
Aye, sir.

01:22:43.589 --> 01:22:45.489
One-six-zero meters.

01:22:45.591 --> 01:22:49.584
- Twenty degrees dive, both planes.
- Twenty degrees dive, aye, sir.

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:53.160
<i>Mr. Tyler, sir,</i>

01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:56.360
uh, do you plan on going up
against a destroyer...

01:22:56.469 --> 01:22:59.632
with only one fish in the tube
and a busted motor?

01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:02.333
Yes, I am, Eddie.

01:23:02.441 --> 01:23:05.103
- How wise is that, Lieutenant?
- <i>Not very.</i>

01:23:05.211 --> 01:23:08.942
But have a look. Chief.

01:23:09.048 --> 01:23:11.175
There is no way a two-knot submarine...

01:23:11.284 --> 01:23:16.017
can get in firing position against
a 30-knot destroyer unless we go deep.

01:23:16.122 --> 01:23:18.420
At 160 meters,

01:23:18.524 --> 01:23:21.459
we can shoot out a bunch of junk
from the forward tubes.

01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:24.621
It will resurface
and create a debris field.

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.925
Now the destroyer's gonna go
to the center of that debris field,

01:23:27.033 --> 01:23:29.524
shut off its engines to make it
real nice and quiet...

01:23:29.635 --> 01:23:32.263
and do an acoustic search
to make sure we're dead.

01:23:32.371 --> 01:23:35.397
But we're not.
See, we're here,

01:23:35.508 --> 01:23:38.306
on our way up to periscope depth.

01:23:38.411 --> 01:23:41.380
<i>All right, principle of ascent velocity.</i>

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.574
Our positive buoyancy pulls us up
and away from the destroyer.

01:23:44.684 --> 01:23:47.812
And when we surface,
we'll be showing it our ass at 700 yards.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.254
<i>That is a perfect setup for a
stern shot on a stationary target.</i>

01:23:52.358 --> 01:23:54.354
Boom.

01:23:54.389 --> 01:23:56.351
<i>It don't get much prettier than that.</i>

01:23:58.297 --> 01:24:00.197
All right, Mr. Tyler.

01:24:00.299 --> 01:24:03.757
All right.
Passing 1-3-0 meters.

01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:06.668
Very well. Rabbit,

01:24:06.772 --> 01:24:09.673
I need you to load Mazzola's body
into tube three...

01:24:09.775 --> 01:24:13.370
and put an escape jacket onto him
to make sure he floats.

01:24:13.479 --> 01:24:15.674
Wanna shoot him out like garbage?

01:24:23.456 --> 01:24:26.892
His body is gonna save our lives.

01:24:26.993 --> 01:24:29.791
I'll say a few words for him.

01:24:29.896 --> 01:24:33.525
Hirsch, go with Rabbit.
Eddie, can you man both planes?

01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:34.753
Yes, sir.

01:24:34.801 --> 01:24:36.796
- Mr. Tyler.
- Yeah.

01:24:36.903 --> 01:24:39.531
If you can't take out that destroyer,

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:42.369
the danger is not
that some of us may die.

01:24:42.475 --> 01:24:44.636
It's that some of us may live.

01:24:47.046 --> 01:24:50.607
These men have seen and heard things...

01:24:50.716 --> 01:24:52.650
that must not be revealed
to the enemy--

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.315
<i>our secrets,</i>

01:24:56.422 --> 01:24:58.652
such as our radar capabilities...

01:24:58.758 --> 01:25:01.249
and our understanding
of German encryption.

01:25:02.962 --> 01:25:07.092
If we fall into German hands alive,
we will be tortured without mercy.

01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:10.532
Either you succeed
in sinking that ship...

01:25:10.636 --> 01:25:13.969
or you must see to it
that none of us survive...

01:25:14.073 --> 01:25:15.973
<i>to be captured.</i>

01:25:48.574 --> 01:25:51.839
We commend his soul to God...

01:25:51.944 --> 01:25:54.310
and commit his body to the deep.

01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:05.157
<i>Mr. Tyler, contact is zigging.</i>

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:09.456
Splashes.

01:26:11.797 --> 01:26:14.129
<i>Contact getting closer.</i>

01:26:14.233 --> 01:26:17.293
More splashes.

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:32.649
Tank, line up to pump
engine room bilge to sea.

01:26:32.752 --> 01:26:34.652
Yes, sir.

01:26:48.634 --> 01:26:50.534
Rabbit,

01:26:52.038 --> 01:26:53.938
fire the tubes.

01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:57.775
Bye, Mazzola.

01:28:13.052 --> 01:28:15.543
They're setting them charges too shallow.

01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:38.234
Secure that air valve!

01:29:52.384 --> 01:29:56.013
<i>Chief, what's our depth?</i>

01:29:56.121 --> 01:29:59.488
One-six-zero meters.

01:30:00.759 --> 01:30:03.592
- Zero the planes.
- Zero the planes.

01:30:03.696 --> 01:30:08.030
Splashes!

01:30:08.133 --> 01:30:10.101
They're too close together!

01:30:10.202 --> 01:30:12.466
<i>I can't count them.</i>

01:30:21.847 --> 01:30:23.747
Chief,

01:30:25.417 --> 01:30:27.317
take us to 200 meters.

01:30:29.555 --> 01:30:33.321
<i>We're gonna get under
these damn things.</i>

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.760
Chief,

01:30:37.863 --> 01:30:40.263
take us to 200 meters.

01:30:46.505 --> 01:30:48.405
Aye, sir.

01:30:54.747 --> 01:30:57.238
Making my depth 200 meters.

01:30:57.349 --> 01:30:59.977
Ten degrees dive, both planes.

01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:01.985
- Ten degrees dive.
- Aye.

01:31:25.377 --> 01:31:27.607
One-seven-zero meters.

01:31:40.059 --> 01:31:41.959
Tank,

01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:44.996
what's the status
on the stern torpedo tube?

01:31:45.097 --> 01:31:49.090
There's a couple things wrong.
I can operate the muzzle door,

01:31:49.201 --> 01:31:51.533
but I'm still working
on the impulse air.

01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:54.105
One-eight-zero meters.

01:31:56.141 --> 01:32:00.009
Mr. Tyler, depth gauge back here
says 180 meters.

01:32:00.112 --> 01:32:03.309
<i>Thanks, Tank. I know.</i>

01:32:04.917 --> 01:32:07.249
Keep working.

01:32:18.997 --> 01:32:21.397
One-nine-zero meters.

01:32:41.754 --> 01:32:46.088
Two-hundred meters.
Zero the planes.

01:32:46.191 --> 01:32:48.091
- Zero the planes, aye.
- Zero the planes.

01:33:51.457 --> 01:33:54.483
Mary, mother of God.

01:33:58.764 --> 01:34:01.494
Those Krauts sure know
how to build a boat.

01:34:10.275 --> 01:34:11.708
Chief, take us up!

01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:16.838
- Blowing negative! Planes full rise!
- Clockwise, Hirsch!

01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:21.883
- Rabbit, help me out!
- Go! Go!

01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.881
Chief, are you seeing this?

01:34:33.732 --> 01:34:38.169
Needle's off the scale!
We have to blow main ballast tanks!

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:39.965
Do it, Chief!

01:34:58.023 --> 01:35:01.550
- She's still going down!
- Ballast tanks are bone dry!

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.151
<i>I'm gonna try the trim tanks!</i>

01:35:09.868 --> 01:35:12.564
Come on, come on, come on!

01:35:23.215 --> 01:35:25.513
She's going up!
She's going up!

01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:45.527
Mr. Tyler, we're coming up.

01:35:45.637 --> 01:35:48.037
But I've lost control
of the ballast tanks.

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:50.700
I can't stop our ascent.

01:35:50.809 --> 01:35:52.970
Where are we with the stern torpedo?

01:35:53.078 --> 01:35:54.978
Piping's damaged.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:58.572
There's a break in the air line,
so there's no pressure to launch a torpedo.

01:35:58.684 --> 01:36:01.915
I tried to bypass the leak,
but it's way back in the bilge underwater.

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:05.080
There's no way to reach it.
I can't fit.

01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:08.125
- Can somebody else get to it?
- I don't know.

01:36:08.226 --> 01:36:11.855
Maybe somebody smaller.

01:36:11.964 --> 01:36:13.898
That's Rabbit or Trigger.

01:36:13.999 --> 01:36:16.866
<i>Comin' up on 200 meters.</i>

01:36:16.969 --> 01:36:18.869
You gotta pick one.

01:36:26.612 --> 01:36:29.080
- Trigger.
- Trigger,

01:36:30.215 --> 01:36:32.308
<i>lay aft with Tank.</i>

01:36:33.652 --> 01:36:37.452
Move it, son.
You got a job to do.

01:36:46.031 --> 01:36:49.091
See, we got no air pressure
to fire the torpedo.

01:36:49.201 --> 01:36:51.829
One of these pipes is busted
and leaking air.

01:36:51.937 --> 01:36:55.429
- How am I gonna find it?
- You'll see bubbles coming out. A lot of 'em.

01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.000
Find the isolation valve
<i>aft of the leak</i> and crank it down.

01:37:00.112 --> 01:37:02.672
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:04.942
I rigged this hose
so you can breathe through it.

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:09.578
Now listen to me.
As soon as you finish, you get out of there.

01:37:09.688 --> 01:37:11.918
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:37:31.677 --> 01:37:34.544
I can hear her.

01:37:36.148 --> 01:37:38.878
Making slow turns.

01:37:43.288 --> 01:37:45.222
She just stopped her screws.

01:37:48.493 --> 01:37:50.552
I think they see the debris.

01:37:53.465 --> 01:37:55.365
I think they're buying it.

01:37:55.467 --> 01:37:57.833
One-eight-zero meters.

01:37:59.171 --> 01:38:02.072
Chief, can you slow our ascent?
We are not ready.

01:38:03.175 --> 01:38:05.541
Can't, sir.

01:38:05.644 --> 01:38:08.044
We got a one-way ticket topside.

01:38:10.248 --> 01:38:14.708
If we surface without a torpedo to fire,
we're dead.

01:38:50.655 --> 01:38:53.886
There's two air leaks.

01:38:53.992 --> 01:38:56.153
I got one, but the other one's
way in the back.

01:38:56.261 --> 01:38:58.786
- <i>I need some more slack on the hose to get to it.</i>
- That's all there is.

01:38:58.897 --> 01:39:00.797
Shit.

01:39:21.853 --> 01:39:24.447
One-five-zero meters.

01:39:27.926 --> 01:39:29.826
I hear Morse code.

01:39:31.396 --> 01:39:34.627
What the hell is it?
Are they signaling us?

01:39:42.073 --> 01:39:43.836
What's it saying, Wentz?

01:39:43.942 --> 01:39:47.207
"I am U-571. Destroy me."

01:39:58.757 --> 01:40:01.225
<i>Coming up on 9-0 meters.</i>

01:40:17.475 --> 01:40:21.377
<i>Sir, she's started her engines again.</i>

01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:28.511
<i>No go, Mr. Tyler.
He can't reach.</i>

01:40:36.027 --> 01:40:39.827
Trigger, in one minute we're gonna hit
the surface. Do you understand me?

01:40:39.931 --> 01:40:42.957
Now you've got to go back
in there and try.

01:40:43.068 --> 01:40:45.298
I wouldn't ask you if our lives
didn't depend on it.

01:40:45.403 --> 01:40:47.963
- Sorry, sir. I can't reach it.
- No, no, Trigger.

01:40:48.073 --> 01:40:49.973
Now listen to me.

01:40:51.076 --> 01:40:54.068
You <i>can</i> reach it,
and you will.

01:40:54.179 --> 01:40:57.273
Now you are gonna close that valve.

01:40:57.382 --> 01:40:59.942
- Sir, I can't!
- You're the only chance we've got.

01:41:04.756 --> 01:41:07.748
Now you're gonna go back down
in that bilge,

01:41:07.859 --> 01:41:10.953
and you're gonna do your job, sailor.

01:41:23.108 --> 01:41:25.941
- Report to me the instant that torpedo's ready to fire.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:29.581 --> 01:41:31.776
Thirty meters.

01:41:31.883 --> 01:41:33.908
- Talk to me, Wentz.
- <i>Destroyer is under way.</i>

01:41:34.019 --> 01:41:37.216
<i>Steady bearing.
They're closing our position.</i>

01:41:37.322 --> 01:41:40.780
Shit!
Come on, Trigger!

01:41:40.892 --> 01:41:42.655
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

01:41:42.761 --> 01:41:44.888
Hold on.
We're gonna surface.

01:41:44.996 --> 01:41:46.896
Raising scope.

01:41:56.007 --> 01:41:57.838
Got her.

01:41:57.943 --> 01:42:00.969
<i>She's heading right for us.</i>

01:42:01.079 --> 01:42:04.173
- Helm, come right ten degrees.
- Aye, sir!

01:42:04.282 --> 01:42:06.842
- Watch your bow planes.
- Aye, sir. Watching my bow planes.

01:42:06.952 --> 01:42:09.284
Tank, start the diesel.
All ahead full!

01:42:17.062 --> 01:42:19.963
Port diesel ahead full!

01:42:41.553 --> 01:42:43.453
Shit, they've got us bracketed.

01:42:45.123 --> 01:42:47.057
Incoming!

01:42:53.898 --> 01:42:55.559
We're hit! We're hit!

01:42:55.667 --> 01:43:00.400
- <i>Wentz, get in here!</i>
- Eddie, secure that hatch!

01:43:17.689 --> 01:43:19.520
Tube still not ready!

01:43:27.332 --> 01:43:29.823
- Request permission to abandon ship!
- Not yet, Chief.

01:43:51.456 --> 01:43:54.983
Control, aft torpedo ready
in all respects!

01:43:55.093 --> 01:43:59.223
- Hold us right there, Rabbit. Hold us steady right here.
- Steady on bearing 8-0 degrees!

01:44:00.999 --> 01:44:02.899
Fire!

01:44:04.202 --> 01:44:06.796
Tank, fire right now or we die!

01:44:12.544 --> 01:44:14.774
Come on, come on.

01:44:17.482 --> 01:44:20.144
Torpedo!

01:45:14.472 --> 01:45:16.497
Well, that blew 'em right in half.

01:45:28.153 --> 01:45:32.112
Hell, Mr. Tyler,
if you ever need a chief,

01:45:32.223 --> 01:45:34.350
I'd go to sea with you anytime.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.860
Thank you, Chief.

01:45:47.639 --> 01:45:49.539
Tank, you okay?

01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:54.410
Trigger drowned.

01:46:04.489 --> 01:46:07.151
That kid didn't give up, did he?

01:46:10.195 --> 01:46:12.823
Neither did you, Mr. Tyler.

01:46:24.642 --> 01:46:26.837
We can't keep her afloat
much longer, sir.

01:46:36.387 --> 01:46:38.287
Let's abandon ship.

01:48:13.151 --> 01:48:15.051
Mr. Tyler. Mr. Tyler.
