00:23.856 --> 00:27.025
<i>How will the springfielder of the
future get around town?</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:29.961
<i>Will he be like bus-stop Bill,
caught out in the rain?</i>

00:31.531 --> 00:33.799
<i>Or will he be like subway Sam,</i>

00:33.866 --> 00:36.802
<i>packed like a tuna on the
Springfield metro line?</i>

00:36.869 --> 00:39.337
<i>Here he can rub shoulders
with fellow businessmen</i>

00:39.405 --> 00:41.473
<i>and share their deadly germs.</i>

00:46.679 --> 00:49.047
<i>These two men might as
well be kissing. </i>

00:49.869 --> 00:54.139
<i>Is there no way to get to work
in comfort, safety and style?</i>

00:54.207 --> 00:55.507
<i>Well, it looks like</i>

00:55.575 --> 00:57.676
<i>Motorcar Mel's got the answer.</i>

00:57.744 --> 01:00.245
<i>He's cruising at 130 miles an hour</i>

01:00.313 --> 01:02.247
<i>in a plutonium-powered auto</i>

01:02.315 --> 01:05.183
<i>on the spacious skyway
of tomorrow.</i>

01:05.251 --> 01:10.389
<i>And it's got plenty of room for all of Mrs.
Mel's shopping.</i>

01:13.026 --> 01:15.994
<i>All that's left is to pick
Junior up from school.</i>

01:18.097 --> 01:21.533
<i>Looks like that robot arm needs
a little adjustment.</i>

01:28.107 --> 01:30.242
Well, that concludes...

01:30.309 --> 01:32.244
I don't really know what that was.

01:32.311 --> 01:33.745
Now please take out your homework.

01:33.813 --> 01:35.847
Homework? What homework?

01:35.915 --> 01:38.316
We had to build a
Hopi Indian pueblo.

01:38.384 --> 01:40.919
Mine features
indigenous Hopi songs.

01:40.987 --> 01:45.190
* And a hie na ho na hey. *

01:45.258 --> 01:46.425
What's this?

01:46.492 --> 01:48.427
A promoter has arrived

01:48.494 --> 01:52.564
to entice the tribe to
perform in a Wild West show.

01:52.632 --> 01:54.466
Unfortunately,

01:54.534 --> 01:57.169
the chief doesn't read the
contract very carefully.

01:58.504 --> 02:02.007
The good news is,
over a hundred years later,

02:02.075 --> 02:04.509
a brilliant little
boy receives an "A"

02:04.577 --> 02:07.045
for his amazing presentation.

02:08.614 --> 02:09.914
Ah...

02:09.982 --> 02:12.017
Bravo, Martin. Bravo.

02:12.085 --> 02:15.687
Well, let's see what the rest
of you dullards have to offer.

02:18.157 --> 02:19.858
Uh-oh.

02:19.926 --> 02:22.427
Oh.

02:22.495 --> 02:23.829
Damn it.

02:23.896 --> 02:25.630
Okay, don't panic.

02:25.698 --> 02:27.666
I can build one of those things
from the crap in my desk.

02:29.869 --> 02:31.803
Bart Simpson, you've had three
months to do this project.

02:31.871 --> 02:33.872
You started 30 seconds ago.

02:33.940 --> 02:35.440
Thank you. Thank you.

02:35.508 --> 02:37.642
I'm not complimenting you.

02:37.710 --> 02:39.878
You've destroyed every ideal
I've had about teaching

02:39.946 --> 02:42.614
since I saw
"To Sir, with Love" as a little girl.

02:42.682 --> 02:44.549
Ha-ha. You're old.

02:44.617 --> 02:46.685
I saw it on video in the '80s.

02:46.752 --> 02:48.253
Outdated medium.

02:48.321 --> 02:49.888
I stand by my ha-ha.

02:49.956 --> 02:52.057
Bart, I'm sending
your parents a letter.

02:52.125 --> 02:56.294
"Irresponsible,
unprepared, bad seed..."

02:56.362 --> 02:57.062
Good guy.

02:57.130 --> 02:58.497
"Bad guy."

02:58.564 --> 03:01.166
Signed... stamped and sealed.

03:03.236 --> 03:07.239
So, can I deliver that
to the office for you?

03:07.306 --> 03:09.207
Hah. I wasn't born yesterday.

03:09.275 --> 03:10.976
Hah. Tell me about it.

03:11.043 --> 03:12.644
Ugh.

03:12.712 --> 03:14.579
Martin?

03:14.647 --> 03:16.848
Outgoing mail slot. Now.

03:18.017 --> 03:20.218
<i>Got to stop that letter.</i>

03:24.624 --> 03:25.957
Oh, fire alarm.

03:26.025 --> 03:27.526
Ooh, that means firemen.

Sixth-graders? No!!!

03:41.007 --> 03:42.741
<i>I'm sure it's a training bra.</i>

03:42.808 --> 03:44.876
<i>PG-13.</i>

03:44.944 --> 03:46.444
<i>I have an unwanted boner.</i>

04:00.126 --> 04:01.826
Yes.

04:03.529 --> 04:05.330
Hoisting a bag.

04:05.398 --> 04:08.366
Ay, there's no better
feeling on earth.

04:12.104 --> 04:13.738
Now what are you up to?

04:13.806 --> 04:15.340
Whatever happened to "Hi"?

04:15.408 --> 04:17.809
Hi. Now what are you up to?

04:17.877 --> 04:19.878
A letter's coming from school,
and I need to be home

04:19.911 --> 04:21.346
to keep Mom and Dad
from getting it.

04:23.182 --> 04:26.151
Mom. I have a fever.

04:29.755 --> 04:32.123
Ooh, 103.

04:32.191 --> 04:35.360
No school today.

04:35.428 --> 04:38.597
Then again, there's only one way
to get a truly accurate reading.

04:38.664 --> 04:40.031
Bart, pants.

04:40.099 --> 04:42.100
Just close your eyes
and think of Milhouse.

04:46.038 --> 04:47.472
Yup. 103 on the dot.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.274
You're staying home.

04:49.342 --> 04:51.943
How did you...?
I don't want to talk about it.

04:52.011 --> 04:54.346
I got to get that letter
before Mom and Dad do.

04:55.581 --> 04:57.482
Stay focused.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.451
Focused.

04:59.518 --> 05:01.519
Focused.

05:01.587 --> 05:03.722
Focused.

05:08.561 --> 05:10.528
Oh.

05:12.298 --> 05:14.633
Credit card offer, overdue bill,

05:14.700 --> 05:17.302
credit card offer, overdue bill.

05:17.370 --> 05:19.004
Huh? What's this?

05:19.071 --> 05:20.505
What the...?

05:20.573 --> 05:22.707
You're a month behind on homework?

05:22.775 --> 05:25.510
I tried really hard to
stop you from finding out.

05:25.578 --> 05:26.978
Does that help?

05:27.046 --> 05:28.647
A little!

05:28.714 --> 05:29.648
<i>These are Bart's</i>

05:29.715 --> 05:31.516
uncompleted homework assignments

05:31.584 --> 05:33.818
for the last month: worksheets,
problem sets,

05:33.886 --> 05:35.186
book reports, math jumbles,

05:35.254 --> 05:37.522
dioramas, topic sentences,
conclusions,

05:37.590 --> 05:39.557
bibliographies, synonyms,
mean-the-sames,

05:39.625 --> 05:41.026
define-a-likes, word twins

05:41.093 --> 05:43.094
and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey.

05:43.162 --> 05:44.663
One month?

05:44.730 --> 05:46.965
That's a heavy workload
for a fourth grader.

05:47.033 --> 05:48.933
I say this boy needs
more homework.

05:49.001 --> 05:51.536
I don't have to do
it with him, do I?

05:51.604 --> 05:52.170
No.

05:52.238 --> 05:53.772
Pile it on.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.274
I want him to be Korean
by the time he's done.

06:02.148 --> 06:03.782
Hmm. Clean dishes.

06:03.849 --> 06:06.584
I either have to unload them,
or, uh...

06:18.164 --> 06:21.166
Oh. Thanks for doing the dishes.

06:21.233 --> 06:23.268
No problem. You can unload.

06:23.336 --> 06:26.604
You know, I think Bart might
have too much homework.

06:26.672 --> 06:28.373
If they keep overwhelming him,

06:28.441 --> 06:30.475
he might be turned
off school forever.

06:30.543 --> 06:34.045
Oh, my. A child who
doesn't enjoy school?

06:34.113 --> 06:36.381
Hello? Hollywood?

06:36.449 --> 06:39.484
You want to buy the movie
rights to this incredible story?

06:39.552 --> 06:41.486
A million dollars?

06:41.554 --> 06:43.121
Deal.

06:43.189 --> 06:46.057
Oh, now I have to write it.

06:46.125 --> 06:49.060
<i>Digibot, Go-go-goman has
the crystal life ball.</i>

06:51.564 --> 06:53.598
Wow, how does this
show stay so fresh?

06:53.666 --> 06:55.200
Hey.

06:55.267 --> 06:56.935
You're supposed to be
doing your homework.

06:57.002 --> 06:58.603
No more TV for you.

07:04.610 --> 07:06.344
Until your homework is done,

07:06.412 --> 07:08.279
the only place your butt is safe

07:08.347 --> 07:10.715
from my foot is in that chair.

07:10.783 --> 07:12.917
Oh.

07:15.221 --> 07:16.788
It's okay, Bart.

07:16.856 --> 07:18.423
Just do a couple vocabulary words,

07:18.491 --> 07:20.291
then come have some
milk and cookies.

07:20.359 --> 07:22.360
But Dad said I had to finish my...

07:22.428 --> 07:23.728
Never mind what he said.

07:23.796 --> 07:25.497
You just listen to me.

07:28.901 --> 07:32.337
Hey, Lis, Mom and Dad just
told me two different things.

07:32.405 --> 07:33.772
How is that possible?

07:33.839 --> 07:36.107
Well, sometimes people
who agree on most things

07:36.175 --> 07:38.676
have one issue that they
disagree strongly about.

07:38.744 --> 07:40.678
In politics,
it's called a wedge issue,

07:40.746 --> 07:42.981
like illegal immigration
or gay marriage.

07:43.048 --> 07:44.482
Wait a minute.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.384
Can I play them against each other

07:46.452 --> 07:48.987
so I don't have to do
any homework at all?

07:49.054 --> 07:51.156
You would mess up Mom
and Dad's marriage

07:51.223 --> 07:53.224
just to get out of
doing some homework?

07:53.292 --> 07:55.727
Hey, hey, I would end
all life on this planet

07:55.795 --> 07:57.362
just to get out of doing fractions.

07:57.430 --> 07:58.963
Fractions aren't that hard.

07:59.031 --> 08:01.032
You just have to find
a common denominator.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.635
For example, one half
plus one third equals...

08:03.702 --> 08:06.771
End... all... life...
on... this... planet!

08:09.341 --> 08:12.076
You'll need to know fractions
to make that explosion!

08:12.144 --> 08:13.311
<i>I don't care.</i>

08:21.125 --> 08:23.960
Oh, so much homework.

08:24.028 --> 08:26.596
Childhood slipping away.

08:28.899 --> 08:32.368
Bart, put down those books
and go play this instant.

08:32.436 --> 08:34.636
If you say so.

08:39.043 --> 08:40.610
Right on time.

08:40.678 --> 08:43.980
Grape soda: shaken, not stirred.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.383
Let's roll.

08:49.787 --> 08:53.590
Dear Lord, please give
my stubborn husband

08:53.657 --> 08:56.526
the wisdom to see that
I am right as usual.

08:56.594 --> 08:58.061
Too late, Marge.

08:58.128 --> 09:00.497
I already used a prayer
block on your prayer.

09:00.564 --> 09:02.365
There's no such thing
as prayer blocks.

09:02.433 --> 09:03.867
Yeah, right.

09:05.736 --> 09:09.239
<i> * Fight, fight, fight,
the Itchy and Scratchy Show. *</i>

09:47.378 --> 09:49.412
Hey, why aren't you
doing your homework?

09:49.480 --> 09:51.314
I said he could take a break.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.383
The violence really relaxes me.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.018
You don't get to relax

09:55.085 --> 09:56.986
till you get to the bottom
of this homework stack.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.255
Don't contradict me
in front of our son.

09:59.323 --> 10:01.558
Well, don't be wrong
in front of our son.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.093
Oh, yeah? Well...

10:12.636 --> 10:15.271
Let's have lunch at Crouching
Tiger Hidden Eggroll.

10:15.339 --> 10:17.540
Hmm. No line, near the men's room.

10:17.608 --> 10:19.509
I see no reason to
question your choice.

10:21.445 --> 10:24.514
Smooth move, Mom,
tricking Dad into having lunch

10:24.582 --> 10:26.716
at the one place that
doesn't serve beer.

10:26.784 --> 10:29.419
What the...? Then I want
to eat at... Moe's Express.

10:29.486 --> 10:30.887
By express, I mean

10:30.955 --> 10:33.222
that you express your
anger and hatred.

10:33.290 --> 10:34.724
The last time you ate there,

10:34.792 --> 10:36.793
you spent three nights
in the mall jail.

10:36.860 --> 10:39.462
That was last week,
and you're still bringing it up.

10:39.530 --> 10:40.997
Well, you always miss

10:41.065 --> 10:42.498
when you throw your
underpants at the hamper.

10:42.566 --> 10:44.300
Well, how could I
ever hit the hamper

10:44.368 --> 10:45.835
if you don't let me practice?

10:45.903 --> 10:47.937
You practiced all
day on my birthday.

10:48.005 --> 10:50.406
Fine. I was gonna apologize,
but now I'm not going to.

10:50.474 --> 10:52.075
You were never going to apologize.

10:52.142 --> 10:53.910
I was, too. The words
were in my brain.

10:53.978 --> 10:55.345
You're wrong,
and whenever you're wrong,

10:55.412 --> 10:56.913
you just spout gibberish.

11:03.587 --> 11:05.121
Congratulations.

11:05.189 --> 11:07.457
You're officially a sociopath.

11:07.524 --> 11:09.392
Hey, at least I'm on a path.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.994
I don't mind if you
pee in the shower,

11:11.061 --> 11:12.795
but only if you're taking a shower.

11:12.863 --> 11:14.230
No freedom.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.032
I have no freedom
around this house.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.635
After sex, I'm not talking to you.

11:18.702 --> 11:20.603
Well, then there won't be any sex.

11:20.671 --> 11:24.140
You can't sex fire me, I sex quit.

11:31.849 --> 11:33.750
<i>Got to stay mad.</i>

11:33.817 --> 11:35.618
<i>The next morning is where the
fight is won or lost.</i>

11:35.686 --> 11:37.387
<i>Freeze him out.</i>

11:37.454 --> 11:39.255
<i>It's cold in Marge's doghouse,
baby.</i>

11:41.759 --> 11:43.993
I just think when
two people disagree,

11:44.061 --> 11:46.663
the big jerk ought to apologize.

11:46.730 --> 11:48.531
You know, Marge,

11:48.599 --> 11:51.200
Maude and I had a fight
right before she died.

11:51.268 --> 11:53.603
Neddy, when you're
drying your hands

11:53.671 --> 11:55.038
with our monogrammed towels,

11:55.105 --> 11:58.207
can you use the "NF" towel,
not the "MF"?

11:58.275 --> 12:01.210
You know, maybe I should
use a towel marked "BDD":

12:01.278 --> 12:02.745
big diddily deal.

12:04.314 --> 12:07.984
I play that fight over in my
mind a thousand times a day.

12:10.487 --> 12:14.023
Must win fight. Must win fight.

12:15.592 --> 12:17.160
Let me say to you all,

12:17.227 --> 12:19.796
I'm pretty sure
this is not a dream.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.799
Oh, my God, I killed her.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.103
I've got to apologize.

12:27.171 --> 12:30.640
Once again, sleeping at
work has saved my marriage.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.909
Compromise has no
place in a marriage.

12:32.976 --> 12:34.677
Stick to your guns.

12:34.745 --> 12:37.947
And if he leaves,
you'll be free and happy, like us.

12:38.015 --> 12:39.982
Yes. Happy.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.918
So happy.

12:41.985 --> 12:42.952
Hmm.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.227
I'm going to find my husband.

12:51.295 --> 12:53.162
Don't depress the kids.

12:55.332 --> 12:58.701
That pacifier's the last
true friend you'll have.

13:00.871 --> 13:03.372
Must apologize. Must apologize.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.519
I'm sorry we ever fought.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.855
We can't let Bart drive us apart.

13:18.922 --> 13:21.591
He's the reason we
had to get married.

13:21.658 --> 13:23.526
Till the two of us
are back on track,

13:23.594 --> 13:25.361
Bart can fend for himself.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.396
Bart? Bart who?

13:27.464 --> 13:29.198
I'm being cute.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.167
It's working.

13:34.872 --> 13:37.039
Put down some flares, boys.

13:37.107 --> 13:40.143
We're gonna be here a while.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.115
Awesome breakfast, Marge.

13:47.182 --> 13:49.450
Breakfast in bed is so much better

13:49.518 --> 13:52.286
than breakfast in a chair.

13:52.354 --> 13:54.589
Mmm. I'm gonna go paste your heads

13:54.656 --> 13:56.491
back into the family photos.

13:56.558 --> 13:57.725
I've got them right here.

13:59.862 --> 14:02.630
Dad, I know you're gonna say no,
but Mom would say...

14:02.698 --> 14:03.765
Whatever. Knock yourself out.

14:03.832 --> 14:04.999
What do you mean?

14:05.067 --> 14:06.868
You may not realize this, Bart,

14:06.935 --> 14:09.437
but your mother and I have been
fighting about you a lot lately.

14:09.505 --> 14:11.606
And I've realized our
marriage is more important

14:11.673 --> 14:12.907
than your future.

14:12.975 --> 14:14.675
From now on, you're on your own.

14:14.743 --> 14:16.711
Really? Okay.

14:20.883 --> 14:22.583
Uh, Marge?

14:22.651 --> 14:23.885
I don't want to ruin the moment,

14:23.952 --> 14:25.653
but you got something
stuck between your...

14:25.721 --> 14:26.921
Oh.

14:29.491 --> 14:32.293
Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon,

14:32.361 --> 14:35.329
with no Bart Simpson,
and no Milhouse, for that matter.

14:35.397 --> 14:38.933
Nothing on my agenda but to sit
here and watch hummingbirds.

14:43.906 --> 14:46.040
Sugar water?

14:46.108 --> 14:48.076
Now, why would someone...

14:48.143 --> 14:50.078
Their tiny tongues are like knives.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.114
Big mistake.

14:53.182 --> 14:55.450
Attacking me outside
school hours and property.

14:55.517 --> 14:57.985
Legally, I can spank
your bare bottoms.

14:58.053 --> 14:59.887
Follow me.

15:05.194 --> 15:08.930
You can't hide forever,
and I'm a very patient man.

15:08.997 --> 15:12.433
I once waited an hour and
a half for a haircut.

15:12.501 --> 15:15.403
Whoa, what is this place?

15:15.471 --> 15:18.706
Remember that time I was
carried off by groundhogs?

15:18.774 --> 15:20.675
This is where I wound up.

15:22.511 --> 15:26.581
Behold, an ancient subway station.

15:31.487 --> 15:33.788
I never knew Springfield
had a subway.

15:33.856 --> 15:36.257
It's like a Thomas the Tank
Engine we can go inside.

15:36.325 --> 15:37.892
With no Sir Topham Hatt

15:37.960 --> 15:40.695
to tell us what we
can and can't do.

15:43.265 --> 15:45.466
Whoa.

15:57.613 --> 15:58.880
Whoa, whoa.

15:58.947 --> 16:00.381
Which flavor do I save:

16:00.449 --> 16:02.917
the Radical Red or
the Blueberry Blast?

16:02.985 --> 16:05.720
Oh, curse this Squishee's choice.

16:15.063 --> 16:17.231
I love watching you knit.

16:17.299 --> 16:19.433
It reminds me of watching
pictures download

16:19.501 --> 16:21.736
on our old dial-up modem.

16:21.803 --> 16:23.471
Remember that day
we brought it home,

16:23.539 --> 16:24.839
and it was all...

16:24.907 --> 16:27.909
eeee... ooo... eee... ooo.

16:33.015 --> 16:36.684
Oh, my God, Homie,
we're having a real conversation.

16:36.752 --> 16:38.386
Yeah.

16:38.453 --> 16:39.887
Eeee.... ooo.

16:42.191 --> 16:44.425
Oh, you won't believe
how I got home.

16:44.493 --> 16:46.294
Don't know, don't care.

16:46.361 --> 16:48.296
You don't even want to know
if I have anything to do

16:48.363 --> 16:50.331
with this mysterious
seismic activity of late?

16:50.399 --> 16:51.933
Nope.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.635
I'm saving my yelling for
where it does some good.

16:54.703 --> 16:57.438
Lisa! You're a wonderful child!

16:57.506 --> 17:00.174
Keep up the good work!

17:00.242 --> 17:01.809
Thanks, Dad.

17:01.877 --> 17:04.212
But you're so loud,
it's hurting my ears.

17:04.279 --> 17:05.880
Sorry!

17:05.948 --> 17:07.448
It's weird.

17:07.516 --> 17:09.951
I just made an entire
town lose its lunch.

17:10.018 --> 17:12.386
And?

17:12.454 --> 17:14.521
And I'm not feeling the rush.

17:14.589 --> 17:16.723
Tell me more.

17:16.791 --> 17:19.060
Something's missing. Am I broken?

17:19.127 --> 17:21.229
Jump with me.

17:24.665 --> 17:26.601
Bart, at the end of the day,

17:26.667 --> 17:28.703
if your parents aren't p.o.
'd, you haven't really pranked.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.571
You got to take it up a notch.

17:30.639 --> 17:32.139
Really?

17:32.207 --> 17:35.209
If no one's getting mad,
are you really being bad?

17:35.277 --> 17:36.777
Think about it.

17:36.845 --> 17:38.379
Wow.

17:38.447 --> 17:40.681
I know.

17:43.585 --> 17:45.987
The tremors are tearing her apart.

17:46.054 --> 17:49.223
One more shake, and the whole
school could come down.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.025
Seymour, do something.

17:54.863 --> 17:58.266
Destroy the school, eh?

17:58.333 --> 18:00.735
That's what I'm talkin' about.

18:02.471 --> 18:04.805
Man, those textbooks really burn.

18:06.642 --> 18:09.176
"Mom and Dad,

18:09.244 --> 18:11.912
Bart is going to
use the old subway

18:11.980 --> 18:14.882
to destroy Springfield Elementary."

18:14.950 --> 18:17.285
And there's a map of the
subway system attached.

18:17.352 --> 18:18.886
Homer, we've got to stop him.

18:18.954 --> 18:20.855
But, Marge, I thought
we were chilling out

18:20.922 --> 18:22.623
for the sake of our marriage.

18:22.691 --> 18:25.726
We're going to have to be
good parents to our son

18:25.794 --> 18:28.729
and work twice as
hard on our marriage.

18:28.797 --> 18:31.465
Fine. I'll do both at once.

18:31.533 --> 18:33.534
We should both take a
role in vacation planning.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.552
Oh, she's coming down.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.821
Oh, Lord, let me
finish this hallway,

18:41.888 --> 18:43.990
then you can send me
to hell a happy man.

18:48.729 --> 18:50.930
Bart!

18:54.568 --> 18:56.636
Oh, there's a nickel.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.278
Destroy. Destroy.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.147
Boy, look at that ironwork.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.488
Well, I'll be.
There's a sofa in here.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.460
It's stuck.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.932
Must... squeeze... harder.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.334
Nah...

19:28.402 --> 19:29.368
Why you little....

19:35.308 --> 19:36.308
Whoo-hoo!

19:40.714 --> 19:42.148
The school is saved.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.883
Unfurl the flag.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.294
Mister, you are grounded.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.263
And no TV.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.732
And I'm taking all the exciting
colors out of your crayons.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.368
And when you're out of my sight,
you must constantly Twitter me

20:02.436 --> 20:03.969
exactly what you are up to,

20:04.037 --> 20:07.440
even though I don't
know what Twitter is

20:07.507 --> 20:09.675
and have no desire to find out.

20:09.743 --> 20:13.179
Ah, you guys are the
meanest parents ever.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.914
Thank you.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.350
Life stinks, huh?

20:18.418 --> 20:19.885
Totally.

20:19.953 --> 20:21.921
Mom said she was tipped
off by a note from me.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.289
But you know something?

20:23.356 --> 20:24.523
I didn't write this note.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.594
That's ridiculous.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.796
If you didn't write it,
who in the world could have?

20:30.864 --> 20:32.698
You wanted to get caught.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.166
Really?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.835
How can you be so sure?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.237
Elementary, my dear Simpson.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.372
Leave it to you to misspell a word

20:40.440 --> 20:42.575
you see first thing every morning.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.144
But don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

20:45.212 --> 20:46.746
As far as Mom and Dad know,

20:46.813 --> 20:48.981
you're just a soulless
little psycho.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.617
Thanks, Lis.

20:51.685 --> 20:52.752
Anytime.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.697
<i>So our family of the future</i>

21:04.765 --> 21:07.466
<i>is once again together and happy.</i>

21:07.534 --> 21:09.235
<i>Mom brings Dad the
evening paper...</i>

21:10.504 --> 21:12.872
<i>...one of six editions
printed daily.</i>

21:12.939 --> 21:14.874
<i>Want to know what happened
in China yesterday?</i>

21:14.941 --> 21:16.876
<i>Read the paper.</i>

21:16.943 --> 21:19.345
<i>And if Mom and Dad want
a little privacy,</i>

21:19.412 --> 21:22.748
<i>Junior can be flash-frozen
until further notice,</i>

21:22.816 --> 21:25.651
