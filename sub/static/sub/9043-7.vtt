WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.533
- RAYMOND.

00:04.533 --> 00:09.267
- HEY. WHAT'S SHAKIN',
BACON?

00:09.267 --> 00:11.367
- WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

00:11.367 --> 00:12.833
I THOUGHT WE
WERE GONNA WATCH

00:12.833 --> 00:18.467
THE BILLY JEAN KING SPECIAL
TOGETHER ON THE ESS-PAN.

00:18.467 --> 00:20.333
- ESPN, MA.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.100
I KNOW. I'M--I'M SORRY.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.600
I CAME HOME,
I HAD THE WORST HEADACHE.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.900
AND I JUST WENT RIGHT TO SLEEP.
- OH.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.967
I MADE A VERY SPECIAL
DINNER FOR YOU LAST NIGHT.

00:28.967 --> 00:30.100
- I KNOW, MA.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.533
IT WAS JUST--
THIS HEADACHE.

00:31.533 --> 00:32.933
IT'S LIKE THERE WERE
TWO MONKEYS IN THERE

00:32.933 --> 00:37.100
AND ONLY ONE BANANA.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.433
- HEY.

00:38.433 --> 00:43.833
FIVE AFTER 7:00.
MORNING, MARIE.

00:43.833 --> 00:47.400
- WERE YOU UP ALL NIGHT
TAKING CARE OF RAYMOND?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.733
BECAUSE YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.133
- UM, YEAH.
RAY HAD A HEADACHE.

00:57.300 --> 01:00.233
SO HE WENT
RIGHT TO BED.

01:00.233 --> 01:02.667
- RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S WHERE IT HURT.

01:02.667 --> 01:05.333
UGH, IT WAS ALL NIGHT.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.633
- OKAY. I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

01:07.633 --> 01:08.633
- ALL RIGHT.

01:08.633 --> 01:09.667
- OH, YOUR FATHER AND I

01:09.667 --> 01:11.200
ARE STILL BABY-SITTING
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.533
- YEP. SEE YOU TONIGHT.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.500
- I'M SURE I'LL SEE YOU
BEFORE THEN.

01:17.833 --> 01:21.667
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.000
WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.533
- I JUST KIND OF STOOD HER UP
LAST NIGHT, YOU KNOW.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.533
SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

01:27.533 --> 01:29.133
BUT I DON'T HAVE A HEADACHE
IN CASE

01:29.133 --> 01:34.333
YOU WANT A LITTLE
RISE-AND-SHINE ACTION.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.300
DEB, COME ON.
I'M READY.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.633
- HEY, RAY, YOU WATCH
THE JETS GAME LAST NIGHT?

01:43.633 --> 01:44.700
- YEAH, I DID.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.700
- HORRIBLE GAME.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.900
- YEP. IT WAS.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.133
- YOU SEE THE TACO COMMERCIAL

01:48.133 --> 01:49.900
WITH THE LADY
AND THE OTHER LADY?

01:49.900 --> 01:52.367
- YEAH.

01:52.367 --> 01:55.100
- THAT PART WAS ALL RIGHT.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.167
- RAYMOND, HOW DID YOU
WATCH THE GAME?

01:57.167 --> 01:58.533
I THOUGHT YOU WENT
RIGHT TO SLEEP

01:58.533 --> 02:00.067
WHEN YOU GOT
HOME FROM WORK.

02:00.067 --> 02:01.667
- YEAH, I DID.
I DID.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.000
I HAD DEBRA TAPE THE GAME
FOR ME,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.733
BECAUSE MY HEAD
HURT SO MUCH.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.767
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
I WATCHED THE GAME,

02:06.767 --> 02:08.867
AND THAT'S HOW I'M ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH DAD.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.533
THE END.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.800
COME ON.
OH, LISTEN--

02:14.800 --> 02:17.300
NEW STORY TO COVER MY "HEADACHE
FROM LAST NIGHT" STORY.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.367
YOU TAPED THE GAME FOR ME
BECAUSE OF MY HEADACHE.

02:19.367 --> 02:20.800
I WATCHED IT
THIS MORNING, OKAY?

02:20.800 --> 02:23.533
- OKAY.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.600
OKAY, SO WE'RE JUST GOIN'
TO DINNER AND A MOVIE.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.433
WE SHOULD BE BACK
AROUND 11:00.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.067
- OKAY, DEAR.
HAVE FUN.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.433
- HEY, RAY. WAIT.

02:30.433 --> 02:33.567
PUT THE TAPE WITH
THE GAME ON FOR ME.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.533
- WHAT?

02:35.533 --> 02:37.800
- YEAH, I WANT TO SEE
THE TACO LADIES AGAIN.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.433
[chuckles]

02:40.433 --> 02:41.500
PUT IT ON.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.967
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:42.967 --> 02:44.567
[clears throat]
THE VCR IS BUSTED.

02:44.567 --> 02:48.900
TWINS HAD A FRIEND OVER TODAY,
AND HE JAMMED A TOY IN IT.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.233
- YEAH, THAT KID, JUSTIN--
HE'S A PSYCHO.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.933
SORRY, DAD.

02:54.933 --> 02:57.100
- HEY, KIDS, STOP, STOP.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.867
WHAT'S WITH
YOUR FRIEND JUSTIN?

02:58.867 --> 03:02.633
I DON'T LIKE TROUBLEMAKERS.

03:02.633 --> 03:04.700
- OKAY, BOYS, LET'S GO UP
AND GET READY FOR BED.

03:04.700 --> 03:05.833
LET'S GO. RIGHT NOW.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.500
- TELL HIM TO KEEP
HIS GRUBBY LITTLE PAWS

03:07.500 --> 03:09.367
OFF OF ANYTHING
GRANDPA USES.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.233
- WHAT?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.700
- BEDTIME, GUYS.
COME ON.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.800
- LET'S GO. COME ON.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.000
[groans]

03:18.000 --> 03:19.700
OH, LISTEN UP FOR A SECOND.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.333
ONE THING BEFORE WE GO.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.600
YOUR MOMMY AND I,
WE TOLD GRANDPA

03:24.600 --> 03:27.167
THAT JUSTIN BROKE THE VCR,
OKAY?

03:27.167 --> 03:31.233
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

03:31.233 --> 03:33.833
- ACTUALLY, YOUR MOTHER SAID IT.
- RAY.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.567
- WHAT?
PLEASE, JUST DO THIS.

03:36.567 --> 03:39.833
- LOOK, WE'RE JUST PLAYING
A LITTLE TRICK

03:39.833 --> 03:41.000
ON GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.867
- YEAH.
A LITTLE TRICK.

03:42.867 --> 03:44.233
SO DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
THE TRICK

03:44.233 --> 03:45.500
BECAUSE THAT WOULD RUIN IT.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.833
- AND THEN ALL THE FUN
WOULD BE GONE.

03:46.833 --> 03:49.333
- YEAH, AND YOU'D BE PUNISHED.
- RAY.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.767
- OKAY.

03:50.767 --> 03:53.933
LOOK, MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE
SOME MOVIE CANDY IN IT FOR YOU

03:53.933 --> 03:55.833
IF YOU KEEP IT A SECRET,
OKAY, HUH?

03:55.833 --> 03:56.933
YOU LIKE MIKE AND IKES?

03:56.933 --> 03:58.167
[laughs]

03:58.167 --> 03:59.333
- OKAY, YOU TWO.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.567
- WHAT?
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

04:01.567 --> 04:04.600
PAJAMAS, TEETH, STORIES,
AND BED.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.033
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.633
AND BE GOOD.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.333
WE GOT TO MOVE NOW.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.333
- OKAY. BYE, FRANK.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.933
- SORRY ABOUT THE VCR.

04:14.933 --> 04:18.233
- I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT,
SEE IF I CAN DO SOMETHING.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.433
- HEY, HEY, HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:21.433 --> 04:22.833
WAIT A MINUTE,
BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

04:22.833 --> 04:24.233
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK OUT
THE WASHING MACHINE?

04:24.233 --> 04:26.533
THE STUPID THING
IS ACTING UP AGAIN.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.333
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

04:29.333 --> 04:33.400
STINKIN' PIECE
OF JAPANESE CRAP.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.100
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:38.100 --> 04:40.500
- BREAKING THE VCR.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.400
WHAT? I WANTED
A NEW ONE ANYWAY.

04:49.867 --> 04:50.900
- IT WAS GOOD, THOUGH.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.133
HEY.
- HI.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.133
- HEY.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.433
- GO AHEAD, FRANK.

04:55.433 --> 04:57.167
TELL 'EM ABOUT
THE WASHING MACHINE.

04:57.167 --> 05:00.200
- WELL, IT SEEMED TO BE
WORKING FINE.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.367
- OH, OKAY.
WELL, GOOD, GOOD.

05:03.367 --> 05:07.733
- SO I TOOK IT APART.

05:10.933 --> 05:14.233
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

05:14.233 --> 05:18.667
THIS PART
WON'T GO BACK IN.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.733
- BEAUTIFUL.

05:24.633 --> 05:27.233
- DON'T WORRY.
I CALLED A REAL REPAIRMAN.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.867
HE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW
BETWEEN 10:00 AND 2:00.

05:29.867 --> 05:30.867
- WELL, GOOD LUCK TO HIM.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.133
I COULDN'T FIX IT,

05:32.133 --> 05:35.233
AND I'M THE SMARTEST
GUY I KNOW.

05:35.233 --> 05:38.067
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

05:38.067 --> 05:39.467
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

05:39.467 --> 05:43.233
- WELL, I SWUNG BY AFTER WORK
TO THANK MA.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.433
SHE DROPPED OFF
A BATCH

05:44.433 --> 05:46.267
OF HER CHICKEN
CACCIATORE TODAY.

05:46.267 --> 05:48.367
YOU LOVE MA'S
CHICKEN CACCIATORE,

05:48.367 --> 05:49.967
DON'T YOU, RAYMOND?

05:49.967 --> 05:52.200
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I DO.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.967
- WELL, HERE.
I SAVED YOU A LITTLE.

05:53.967 --> 05:57.267
[breathing loudly]

06:00.933 --> 06:05.700
- OH, MA, YOU MADE IT WITH
THE SWEET PEPPERS I LIKE!

06:07.067 --> 06:10.767
- AND IT WAS
JUST FOR ME AND AMY.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.500
OH, AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M GLAD I CAME BY

06:12.500 --> 06:15.100
BECAUSE GEOFFREY TOLD ME
THE FUNNIEST THING.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.867
YEAH.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.067
HE TOLD ME THAT YOU TWO WERE
PLAYING SOME KIND OF TRICK

06:19.067 --> 06:21.167
ON GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.900
AND I COULDN'T GET
ANYTHING ELSE OUT OF HIM,

06:24.900 --> 06:28.300
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
IT DID PIQUE MY INTEREST.

06:28.300 --> 06:32.500
SO, UH, WHAT'S UP,
TRICKSTERS?

06:34.633 --> 06:36.167
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOIN' ON HERE?

06:36.167 --> 06:37.667
YOU PLAYING
A TRICK ON ME?

06:37.667 --> 06:40.333
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING. IT'S NOTHING.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.733
THE TRICK WAS
THAT, UH...

06:42.733 --> 06:47.000
- WE DIDN'T GO TO DINNER
AND A MOVIE TONIGHT.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.400
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.033
WHY WOULD YOU PLAY A TRICK
ON WHERE YOU WENT?

06:52.200 --> 06:57.200
- BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
WENT TO A HOTEL.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.100
YOU KNOW,
WITH--WITH THE KIDS,

07:04.100 --> 07:06.200
WE NEVER HAVE TIME
TO OURSELVES.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.067
- SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE IT
A SPECIAL NIGHT...

07:10.067 --> 07:13.233
- OF PASSION.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.800
- YES.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.700
WE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE
AND MASSAGES AND...

07:23.700 --> 07:27.733
REKINDLED OUR LOVE.

07:27.733 --> 07:29.533
- AND, YOU KNOW, JUST--

07:29.533 --> 07:31.133
WE DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING,

07:31.133 --> 07:33.133
'CAUSE IT'S
A LITTLE EMBARRASSING.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.167
- BUT THE TRUTH
IS OUT.

07:35.167 --> 07:38.100
- ABOUT OUR SEX.

07:40.167 --> 07:42.567
- WELL, HOW...

07:42.567 --> 07:47.400
NICE FOR YOU.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.533
- DON'T GET ANY IDEAS, MARIE.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.467
- ANYONE ELSE WANT TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

07:56.467 --> 07:58.467
- ME!

07:58.467 --> 08:01.833
- OKAY, THANKS FOR
BABY-SITTING, THANK YOU.

08:01.833 --> 08:02.967
- OKAY.

08:02.967 --> 08:05.633
- SORRY ABOUT THE TRICK.

08:05.633 --> 08:09.100
- I GO TO HOTELS
TO GET AWAY FROM MY WIFE.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.233
- GOOD NIGHT.

08:10.233 --> 08:12.733
GOOD NIGHT.

08:12.733 --> 08:13.933
- OOH.

08:13.933 --> 08:17.100
- I FEEL A LITTLE BAD.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.567
- WHY?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:18.567 --> 08:19.933
WE'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.100
- I KNOW.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.900
MAYBE A LITTLE
TOO GOOD.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.600
- HEY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUR MOTHER.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.867
WE'RE LIVING
IN A PREDATORY ENVIRONMENT.

08:27.867 --> 08:31.200
WE HAVE TO CAMOUFLAGE.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.567
- YEAH. WHATEVER.

08:32.567 --> 08:33.767
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT HER FEELINGS

08:33.767 --> 08:36.300
ABOUT LAST NIGHT, SO...

08:36.300 --> 08:41.533
I DID LIKE THAT WHOLE
"SEX IN THE HOTEL" PART.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.433
- I DID TOO.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.133
WHEN YOU CAME UP
WITH PART OF THE STORY,

08:45.133 --> 08:46.733
THEN I CAME UP WITH A PART,

08:46.733 --> 08:48.367
THEN YOU, THEN ME.

08:48.367 --> 08:52.767
WE HAD A GREAT
LITTLE...RHYTHM.

08:52.767 --> 08:56.767
IT'S LIKE OUR OWN
LITTLE SEX-CAPADE.

08:59.433 --> 09:02.633
- THAT'S MY FAVORITE
KIND OF CAPADE.

09:04.933 --> 09:06.833
- YOU WANT TO GO UP?

09:06.833 --> 09:08.833
- MM. WOW!

09:08.833 --> 09:13.200
THIS'LL BE TWICE IN ONE NIGHT
IF YOU COUNT THE LIE.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.300
- HEY, THAT REPAIR GUY'S
GONNA BE HERE

09:18.300 --> 09:19.567
BETWEEN 10:00 AND 2:00.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.267
CAN YOU WAIT FOR HIM?
- OH, WAIT.

09:21.267 --> 09:23.567
I GOT GOLF
WITH GIANNI TOMORROW.

09:23.567 --> 09:24.700
- GOLF?
- YEAH.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.733
- OH, I REALLY NEED
THE WASHING MACHINE.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.733
- WELL, YEAH, BUT THAT'S
MY ONE DAY OFF.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.100
- WELL, I CAN'T BE HERE,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.233
'CAUSE I HAVE
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.967
- [sighs deeply]

09:33.967 --> 09:35.900
ALL RIGHT.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.433
WAIT. HO--

09:37.433 --> 09:40.533
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT?

09:40.533 --> 09:43.600
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU REMEMBERED THAT?

09:43.600 --> 09:47.233
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING--
I'M LYING?

09:47.233 --> 09:50.033
- NO. GOSH.
WHY WOULD I SAY THAT?

09:50.033 --> 09:51.900
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GREAT AT IT

09:51.900 --> 09:55.267
OR LOVE DOING IT
OR ANYTHING.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.267
- YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.467
- NO, I DO, I DO.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.867
OF COURSE, I DO.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.267
- I'M GOIN' TO SLEEP.

10:03.267 --> 10:04.633
- AW, COME ON!

10:04.633 --> 10:05.700
- I HAVE A HEADACHE.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.467
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT!

10:07.467 --> 10:09.133
YOU CAN'T USE
HEADACHE TODAY.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.267
I ALREADY DID IT.

10:15.233 --> 10:18.133
- HEY.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

10:18.133 --> 10:19.967
- I'M DOING LAUNDRY
FOR YOU AT MY HOUSE.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.900
IT WAS PILING UP
SO HIGH,

10:21.900 --> 10:25.267
I STARTED TO WORRY IT
MIGHT FALL ON THE CHILDREN.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.700
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT--THAT'S OKAY.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.933
WE HAD THE WASHING MACHINE
FIXED TODAY.

10:30.933 --> 10:33.833
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.700
- HEY.

10:37.233 --> 10:38.800
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.400
WHY ISN'T
THE WASHING MACHINE FIXED?

10:40.400 --> 10:41.800
- OH, YEAH, YEAH,
HERE'S THE THING.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.033
THE GUY, HE CALLED BACK.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.533
HE HAD TO RESCHEDULE
FOR TOMORROW,

10:44.533 --> 10:48.767
BUT YOU'LL BE HERE,
RIGHT, FROM 10:00 TO 2:00?

10:51.567 --> 10:56.400
- SO THE REPAIR GUY
CALLED BACK TO RESCHEDULE

10:56.400 --> 10:59.200
FOR WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE,

10:59.200 --> 11:00.633
AND YOU WENT GOLFING.

11:00.633 --> 11:05.167
- I BELIEVE THAT WAS
THE ORDER OF THINGS, YES.

11:05.167 --> 11:06.433
- LET'S GO, MARIE.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.567
I'M STARIN' AT
THE BUSINESS END

11:07.567 --> 11:09.833
OF A PAIR OF
RAY'S SKIVVIES.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.900
- SHUSH!

11:11.900 --> 11:13.733
- HI!
- HELLO!

11:13.733 --> 11:14.767
all: HI.

11:14.767 --> 11:15.967
- HEY, MA.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.567
BROUGHT BACK
YOUR CACCIATORE PAN,

11:17.567 --> 11:21.067
LICKED CLEAN.

11:21.067 --> 11:23.167
- SO...
ROBERT TOLD ME

11:23.167 --> 11:27.000
ABOUT YOUR SPECIAL EVENING
LAST NIGHT.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.033
SO WHICH HOTEL
DID YOU GUYS GO TO?

11:30.033 --> 11:32.200
- OH, YEAH. NO, NO, NO.
THAT, UH...

11:32.200 --> 11:34.233
- ACTUALLY, AMY, IT WASN'T
A GREAT HOTEL.

11:34.233 --> 11:36.167
- YEAH, YEAH. YOU WOULDN'T
LIKE IT.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.200
- WE DIDN'T SPEND
THAT MUCH MONEY

11:38.200 --> 11:43.967
BECAUSE RAY'S SO,
YOU KNOW, CHEAP.

11:43.967 --> 11:47.100
- WELL, UH...
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.033
I THOUGHT THAT'S
HOW YOU--YOU LIKED IT--

11:49.033 --> 11:52.167
CHEAP AND TRASHY.

11:52.167 --> 11:55.600
YEAH, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS TOO TRASHY FOR ME,

11:55.600 --> 11:57.200
BUT DEBRA SAID,
"COME ON, RAY,

11:57.200 --> 11:59.300
THE TRASHIER,
THE BETTER," YOU KNOW?

11:59.300 --> 12:00.700
AND I'M, LIKE,
"WHAT?"

12:00.700 --> 12:04.500
AND SHE'S ALL LIKE,
"MM, YEAH, TRASHY!"

12:11.067 --> 12:12.767
- YEAH, I GUESS
IT WAS SO TRASHY

12:12.767 --> 12:17.100
THAT THAT'S WHY RAY
REALLY COULDN'T...YOU KNOW.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.167
- OH, I COULD.
BELIEVE ME, I COULD.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.767
IT'S JUST THAT
THE MOOD WAS RUINED

12:23.767 --> 12:28.400
BECAUSE DEBRA WANTED TO--
TO--TO BUY DRUGS.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.300
- I KNOW YOU'RE LYING
ABOUT THE REPAIRMAN.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.167
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I CANCELED IT MYSELF!

12:36.167 --> 12:37.667
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.133
BECAUSE I CALLED
DR. DWIGHT'S OFFICE,

12:39.133 --> 12:41.300
AND SURPRISE, SURPRISE!

12:41.300 --> 12:43.833
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

12:43.833 --> 12:47.600
YOU WERE LYING
LIKE A RUG!

12:51.300 --> 12:55.000
- RAY, DR. DWIGHT
IS NOT MY DOCTOR ANYMORE.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.300
I SWITCHED LAST YEAR.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.367
YOU CALLED THE WRONG PLACE.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.067
- WE SHOULD GO, ROBERT.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.567
- NO, NO, NO.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.533
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
STAY.

13:04.533 --> 13:10.467
- SO, DEB, YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE
A NAUGHTY PARTY GIRL, HUH?

13:12.033 --> 13:13.467
- NO, FRANK.

13:13.467 --> 13:15.500
- HEY, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS NEW DOCTOR?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.233
- RAY, WOULD YOU STOP IT?
ENOUGH!

13:17.233 --> 13:18.967
- NO, NO. COME ON, THE NAME.
GIVE ME THE NAME.

13:18.967 --> 13:20.100
RIGHT NOW, THE NAME!

13:20.100 --> 13:23.633
- FLOWERS. DR. FLOWERS.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.833
- OH! NICE TRY.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.867
DR. FLOWERS, HUH?

13:30.867 --> 13:33.200
YEAH, SURE.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.533
YOU SURE IT'S NOT
DR. CABINET?

13:35.533 --> 13:37.267
HUH?

13:37.267 --> 13:40.667
OR--OR DR. SCRUBBY BRUSH?

13:43.800 --> 13:46.033
HA, HA, YEAH!

13:46.033 --> 13:47.933
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF
IN TOWN,

13:47.933 --> 13:52.367
AND HE JUST
SHOT YOUR DOCTOR.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.367
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

13:59.367 --> 14:01.567
- NOTHING, MA, FORGET IT.
IT'S NOTHING.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.433
- THEN WHAT'S
WITH ALL THIS CRAZY TALK?

14:03.433 --> 14:05.400
- HEY, RAY, I'M EATING
THE REST OF THESE.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.533
- GO AHEAD.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.700
- YOU'RE EATING CANDY?
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

14:09.700 --> 14:12.033
- THEY WERE STICKIN' OUT
OF RAY'S PANTS HERE.

14:13.633 --> 14:17.100
- THIS IS YOUR PANTS
THAT YOU WORE LAST NIGHT.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.100
"MIKE AND IKES"?

14:20.100 --> 14:22.567
THAT'S A VERY BIG BOX--

14:22.567 --> 14:25.500
THE KIND YOU GET
AT THE MOVIES, BUT...

14:25.500 --> 14:28.700
DEBRA, YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T GO TO THE MOVIES.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.533
- RIGHT.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.367
WE GOT THOSE
AT THE HOTEL.

14:37.367 --> 14:41.767
- YEAH, OUT OF
THE MINIBAR, YEAH.

14:44.200 --> 14:48.600
- WHAT IS THE NAME
OF THE HOTEL?

14:48.600 --> 14:50.300
NO, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.767
WHY DON'T YOU
WHISPER THE NAME TO ME,

14:53.767 --> 14:55.833
AND THEN WE'LL SEE
WHAT DEBRA SAYS--

14:55.833 --> 14:56.967
IF IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

14:56.967 --> 14:59.800
COME OVER HERE.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.133
COME HERE.

15:02.133 --> 15:05.433
GO AHEAD.

15:05.433 --> 15:09.033
- [loud whisper]
RAMADA.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.067
- THERE WAS NO HOTEL...

15:26.067 --> 15:27.633
WHICH MEANS...

15:27.633 --> 15:30.067
THAT WASN'T THE TRICK
YOU PLAYED ON US.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.733
SO THEN WHAT WAS IT?

15:31.733 --> 15:35.000
- THERE WAS NO--NOTHING.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.667
- THE WASHING MACHINE?

15:37.667 --> 15:40.800
HAVING FRANK FIX SOMETHING
THAT WASN'T BROKEN?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.067
- YES, THAT'S IT!

15:42.067 --> 15:45.400
HA, HA, GOTCHA!

15:45.400 --> 15:50.367
- WHY, YOU LOUSY,
BIG-NOSED BASTARD!

15:56.233 --> 15:58.233
- WHERE'S THE TRICK IN THAT?

15:58.233 --> 16:02.833
AND WHY DO YOU INCLUDE
MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY?

16:02.833 --> 16:05.767
HMM...

16:05.767 --> 16:11.667
- SHE'S PICKING UP A SCENT.
WATCH THIS.

16:11.667 --> 16:15.233
- WHY DID YOU
RUSH THE KIDS UPSTAIRS?

16:15.233 --> 16:18.200
THE VCR. THE--

16:18.200 --> 16:23.233
THE KIDS DIDN'T BREAK
THE VCR.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.933
BUT WHY WOULD YOU LIE
ABOUT IT BEING BROKEN?

16:25.933 --> 16:28.967
- THIS IS GREAT.

16:28.967 --> 16:34.333
I'M USUALLY BEHIND
ONE-WAY GLASS DURING THIS PART.

16:38.567 --> 16:44.167
- BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TAPE
FOR FRANK TO WATCH...

16:44.167 --> 16:45.333
WHICH MEANS YOU DID WATCH

16:45.333 --> 16:47.633
THE FOOTBALL
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

16:47.633 --> 16:52.500
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A HEADACHE.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.967
YOU LIED TO ME.

16:54.967 --> 16:57.100
YOU BOTH DID.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.067
- OH, MARIE,
HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT?

16:59.067 --> 17:01.933
YOU ARE WAY OFF,
RIGHT, RAY?

17:01.933 --> 17:06.033
- HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

17:06.033 --> 17:07.567
- I CAN PUT THINGS TOGETHER.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.767
YOU THINK I WAS BORN
YESTERDAY?

17:09.767 --> 17:13.400
- ANYONE?

17:20.733 --> 17:23.367
- MARIE, WE DIDN'T
REALLY LIKE

17:23.367 --> 17:25.067
THE CHICKEN CACCIATORE
YOU MADE FOR US,

17:25.067 --> 17:26.833
SO WE ORDERED
CHINESE INSTEAD.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.000
- AMY!

17:31.967 --> 17:33.300
- WHEN SHE CAME OVER
THIS MORNING,

17:33.300 --> 17:35.133
I THINK SHE NOTICED
THE TAKEOUT CONTAINERS.

17:35.133 --> 17:38.533
IT WAS JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.867
- MARIE...

17:41.867 --> 17:46.267
- NOW WE KNOW WHAT LITTLE
RESPECT YOU HAVE FOR US.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.733
- COME ON, MA,
LOOK, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17:47.733 --> 17:51.733
IT JUST--IT SNOWBALLED FROM
ONE TINY LITTLE LIE.

17:51.733 --> 17:55.200
- SO WHEN YOU LIED
RIGHT TO MY FACE,

17:55.200 --> 17:59.133
YOU CONSIDER THAT
A TINY LITTLE LIE?

17:59.133 --> 18:00.267
- NO, I JUST...

18:00.267 --> 18:02.467
I MEAN,
DEBRA AND I WERE--

18:02.467 --> 18:03.833
- DON'T BRING DEBRA
INTO THIS.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.367
- YEAH, RAY.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.333
- LOOK, MA, I JUST...

18:13.333 --> 18:15.800
JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS, THAT'S ALL.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.433
- MY FEELINGS?

18:18.433 --> 18:22.967
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.467
AND YOUR TINY
LITTLE LIE

18:25.467 --> 18:30.333
IS ACTUALLY THE ONE
THAT HURTS THE MOST.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.167
- LISTEN, MA.

18:35.167 --> 18:40.000
ABOUT YOUR
CHICKEN CACCIATORE--

18:40.000 --> 18:41.800
AMY WAS THE ONE
WHO THREW IT OUT.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.767
- ROBERT!

18:50.867 --> 18:53.833
- YOU THREW OUT
MY FOOD,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.933
FOOD I SPECIALLY MADE
FOR YOU?

18:55.933 --> 18:57.300
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.900
YOU DIDN'T MAKE
THAT FOOD FOR ROBERT.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.200
YOU MADE
THAT CACCIATORE FOR RAY,

19:01.200 --> 19:02.967
FOR YOUR SPECIAL
NIGHT TOGETHER.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.133
- MA?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.900
IS THAT TRUE?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.833
- NO, I MADE TWO.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.333
- TELL ME THE TRUTH.

19:13.333 --> 19:17.700
DID WE ONLY GET IT
BECAUSE RAYMOND DIDN'T SHOW UP?

19:17.700 --> 19:20.633
- GIVE ME A MINUTE.

19:24.367 --> 19:25.833
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.233
IF YOU DIDN'T EAT
THE CACCIATORE LAST NIGHT,

19:27.233 --> 19:28.600
THEN WHAT DID YOU
BREATHE ON ME?

19:28.600 --> 19:33.067
- KUNG PAO.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

19:33.067 --> 19:36.300
- ROBBIE, I MADE
THE CACCIATORE FOR RAYMOND

19:36.300 --> 19:38.567
'CAUSE I HAD PLANNED
A VERY SPECIAL EVENING.

19:38.567 --> 19:41.267
THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT
THINGS WE HAD TO DISCUSS.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.767
- IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DISCUSS?

19:43.767 --> 19:47.933
YOU TOLD ME YOU WANTED
TO WATCH A SPORTS SHOW WITH ME.

19:47.933 --> 19:51.233
- WHICH WE WOULD
THEN DISCUSS.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.033
- BULL CRAP!
- FRANK!

19:53.033 --> 19:54.400
- SHE HAD NOTES PREPARED.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.467
THEY WERE TOPICS
FOR HER EVENING WITH RAYMOND.

19:56.467 --> 19:59.533
THEY WERE ALL COMPLAINTS.

19:59.533 --> 20:04.133
I WAS ONE
OF THE CATEGORIES.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.333
DEBRA WAS THE REST
OF THE CATEGORIES.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.433
- YOU HAD NOTES?

20:14.433 --> 20:18.500
- I WASN'T EVEN
A CATEGORY.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.467
- NO WONDER SHE'S SO GOOD
AT FINDING OUT WE'RE LYING.

20:24.467 --> 20:25.867
IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

20:25.867 --> 20:28.533
- I DO NOT LIE.
- NO?

20:28.533 --> 20:30.367
SO IF WE WERE TO GO
OVER TO YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW,

20:30.367 --> 20:32.300
WE WOULDN'T FIND
ANY NOTES?

20:32.300 --> 20:34.367
- ABSOLUTELY NOT!

20:34.367 --> 20:36.767
AND I WOULD
LIKE TO SAY

20:36.767 --> 20:39.867
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE ALL GANGING UP

20:39.867 --> 20:43.667
ON AN ELDERLY WOMAN...

20:43.667 --> 20:48.833
WHO HASN'T BEEN
FEELING VERY WELL LATELY.

20:48.833 --> 20:51.567
I NEED TO LIE DOWN.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.600
- AH, YOU WOULDN'T, UH--
YOU WOULDN'T BE GOING

20:56.600 --> 21:00.100
TO DESTROY THOSE NOTES,
WOULD YOU?

21:00.100 --> 21:02.367
- PLEASE.

21:04.033 --> 21:06.267
- WOW.

21:06.267 --> 21:10.500
FOR A SICK OLD LADY,
SHE CAN REALLY MOVE.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.333
- BYE, MOM.
BYE, DAD.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.400
- HEY, HEY,
WHERE YOU GOIN'?

21:18.400 --> 21:19.800
- OVER TO MOLLY'S HOUSE.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.267
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
DON'T YOU HAVE HOMEWORK?

21:22.267 --> 21:23.967
- OH, WE'RE DOING IT THERE.

21:23.967 --> 21:25.367
- WHERE ARE YOUR BOOKS?

21:25.367 --> 21:26.600
- OH, THEY'RE
AT MOLLY'S HOUSE.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.000
SHE TOOK THEM
HOME FOR ME

21:28.000 --> 21:29.367
BECAUSE SHE KNEW
WE WERE GOING THERE

21:29.367 --> 21:31.733
TO DO OUR HOMEWORK,
RIGHT, MOLLY?

21:31.733 --> 21:35.267
- RIGHT.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
- OKAY. BYE.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.333
[door closes]

21:48.133 --> 21:50.133
- SHE GETS THAT FROM YOU.
