He cannot get a very far, come on.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.675
This guy ... 

08:16.926 --> 08:18.490

08:41.847 --> 08:44.349
Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich?

10:51.664 --> 10:53.958
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

10:54.271 --> 10:56.461
His wife's always picking on him.

10:56.669 --> 10:59.797
He probably got angry and decided to start beating her.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.072
Ok, deal.

11:04.177 --> 11:05.637
{y:i}Are your folks home?

11:05.845 --> 11:07.722

11:07.826 --> 11:12.727

I asked him what was going on.

12:45.945 --> 12:47.613
He said ...
- Inside you guys.

12:47.822 --> 12:49.595
He said he'd shot somebody.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.397
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

13:47.674 --> 13:48.612

15:57.804 --> 15:59.472
Come on honey. Thank you.

16:02.287 --> 16:03.330
Where's Doc. Mixter?

16:03.539 --> 16:05.311

16:05.520 --> 16:06.667

16:27.938 --> 16:29.189
Ah yes ...

16:29.606 --> 16:31.275

16:32.213 --> 16:33.673
We'll need to a type it.

16:37.739 --> 16:40.763
When was the last time you had a tetatus shot?

16:41.285 --> 16:42.536
I don't know.

16:48.792 --> 16:49.939
Get me some ...

16:50.043 --> 16:52.546

16:52.650 --> 16:53.693

16:53.901 --> 16:55.883
We're going to have to put her out.
- No!

16:56.300 --> 16:58.698
No, don't put me to sleep.
- Ok, relax.

16:58.802 --> 17:00.158
Nylon's not gonna hurt you.

17:00.262 --> 17:01.409
No.

17:03.494 --> 17:05.476
Please don't put me to sleep.

17:07.978 --> 17:09.125
Take it easy.

17:14.026 --> 17:15.589
Try to relax, Laurie.

17:17.884 --> 17:20.281
Doctor Mixter have you stitched up in no time.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.576
Take it easy, Laurie.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.747
Circle the block again.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.458
How long now?

17:29.562 --> 17:31.543
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there. 

17:31.648 --> 17:33.316
There, by those trees.

17:33.733 --> 17:35.401
There is nothing.

17:35.506 --> 17:37.070
Well, keep going.

17:37.695 --> 17:40.093
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

17:40.198 --> 17:41.032
What?

17:41.240 --> 17:43.951
The point where I stop taking orders from you.

17:44.473 --> 17:47.184
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

17:47.288 --> 17:49.791
The primary concern is that we stop him.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.563
You let him out.

17:51.668 --> 17:54.274
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

17:54.379 --> 17:56.255
I didn't let him out.

17:56.568 --> 17:58.237
{y:i}Hey Brackett come in please...

17:58.654 --> 18:00.426
{y:i}Hey Brackett come in please ...

18:03.242 --> 18:04.493
Say again, what is it?

18:04.597 --> 18:05.640

18:06.265 --> 18:07.100
Where are you?

18:07.204 --> 18:11.792
{y:i}I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville road.
- Get the hell back in the town.

18:11.896 --> 18:14.711

18:14.816 --> 18:16.693
{y:i}10 - 4 Ramsey clear.

18:17.318 --> 18:19.195
Will you put that thing away!

18:21.385 --> 18:23.470
You couldn't have shot him six times!

18:23.783 --> 18:26.703
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

18:26.807 --> 18:30.248
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

18:31.499 --> 18:35.044
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

18:38.172 --> 18:39.007
Is that him?

18:39.111 --> 18:40.362
I don't know.

18:42.865 --> 18:43.386
Get back!

18:43.594 --> 18:45.159
Run! Come on, run!

18:45.263 --> 18:46.201

19:01.008 --> 19:02.467
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

19:14.354 --> 19:15.918
Oh, sheriff Brackett. 

19:18.004 --> 19:19.255
He came out of nowhere.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.715
I couldn't stop.

19:20.924 --> 19:21.862
Is it him?!

19:26.971 --> 19:28.744
Is it him or not!?

19:35.939 --> 19:36.773
Leigh ...

19:38.232 --> 19:40.318
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

19:40.631 --> 19:42.612
Across the street from the Doyle house.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.280
Three kids ...

19:45.010 --> 19:46.783
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

19:46.887 --> 19:47.930
What?

19:58.774 --> 20:00.338
Does it hurt a lot?

20:01.589 --> 20:02.423
What?

20:03.779 --> 20:08.158
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you. Look, it'll be ok.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.556

20:21.401 --> 20:23.277

20:23.382 --> 20:26.614

{y:i}reporting you live.

21:06.237 --> 21:07.384
Hi ...

21:08.218 --> 21:09.574
Hi.

21:11.451 --> 21:12.285
Jimmy ...

21:14.683 --> 21:15.830
Oh, how are you feeling?

21:16.977 --> 21:18.332
Sore.

21:20.522 --> 21:21.773
What happened?

21:21.878 --> 21:23.129
Cracked the bone.

21:23.755 --> 21:25.006
Lucky it wasn't a break.

21:25.110 --> 21:29.072
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait untill tomorrow,
before he put cast on.

21:29.594 --> 21:30.845
You have to get some rest.

21:32.722 --> 21:33.869
Come on, Jimmy.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.234
Can I get you something to drink or anything?

21:46.277 --> 21:47.528
How about a coke?

21:48.050 --> 21:49.092
Ok.

21:49.718 --> 21:50.865
Thanks.

21:51.178 --> 21:52.012
Ok.

21:52.325 --> 21:52.638
Come on!

21:52.742 --> 21:55.349
Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another call came in.
- Ok.

21:55.974 --> 21:57.017
I'll get you that coke later.

21:57.851 --> 21:58.790
Out.

22:02.126 --> 22:05.776
Moments ago police reported that Michael Myers,
formerly of Haddonfield, 

22:05.880 --> 22:10.989
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren county Sanitarium
last night was believed to have burned to death.

22:11.094 --> 22:15.577
Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered
in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.

22:15.682 --> 22:19.227
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families ...

22:19.331 --> 22:22.042
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

22:22.146 --> 22:24.962
Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.

22:25.066 --> 22:30.175
You need the parent's permission to use a statement.
If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.

22:32.365 --> 22:33.512
Not now ...

22:39.664 --> 22:40.915
Give us a minute, fellas.

23:11.884 --> 23:12.822
I .. uh

23:14.178 --> 23:19.704
have to ... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

23:21.789 --> 23:23.458
Go on home, Leigh.

23:23.562 --> 23:25.960
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

23:26.273 --> 23:31.799
Damn you! - I'm sorrry. -What have you done?
- I haven't done anything. - YOU LET HIM OUT!

23:32.008 --> 23:35.345
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

23:36.387 --> 23:39.203
Now is there anything else, that we can do for you?

23:39.515 --> 23:43.373
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car ...

23:43.478 --> 23:47.023
then lot of other kids are gonna be slaugtered tonight.
- He's dead. 

23:47.232 --> 23:49.317
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

23:49.421 --> 23:54.739
It was him. - I wanna believe you,
but I gotta be sure.

23:54.947 --> 24:00.995
You talk about him like he's some kind of animal.
- He was my ... - Would you keep it back?!

24:01.099 --> 24:06.939
He became an obsession with me, until I realized,
that there was nothing within.

24:07.043 --> 24:09.545
even remotely human.

24:09.650 --> 24:14.967
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him
and he just got up and walked away.

24:15.072 --> 24:19.764
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

24:21.015 --> 24:22.371
Where'd they take the body?

24:22.684 --> 24:23.935
The Coroner's office.

24:24.039 --> 24:26.646
Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.

24:37.907 --> 24:43.121
{y:i}Despite the fact that the man, who rescued Laurie Strode,
{y:i}claims to have shot him six times at close range.

24:43.329 --> 24:46.666
{y:i}Haddonfield police have no explanation
{y:i}for the suspect's disappearance ...

24:46.874 --> 24:51.775
{y:i}But say they're confident, he will be captured soon.
- I cannot believe it.

24:51.879 --> 24:55.842
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for apples.
Actually bobbing for water. No less.

24:55.946 --> 25:02.307
Well you gotta use water to see if you don't ...
- I am never going to another halloween party

25:02.411 --> 25:03.975
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

25:04.079 --> 25:05.956
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

25:06.164 --> 25:08.771
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

25:10.023 --> 25:11.899
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

25:12.108 --> 25:13.881
He's in Russelville.

25:14.715 --> 25:19.511
It's five minutes to your house another five minutes
back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

25:20.762 --> 25:22.014
You promised me.

25:24.516 --> 25:26.393
I know I did.

25:49.645 --> 25:51.314
{y:i}One survivor ...

25:51.418 --> 25:56.840
{y:i}17- year  old Laurie Strode was found directly across
{y:i}the street from the home, where the murders took place.

25:56.944 --> 26:02.262
{y:i}The teenager was taken across town to
{y:i}Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Paramedics on the scene ...

27:22.134 --> 27:29.120
{y:i}In of aftermath of the killings the streets between
{y:i}Chestnut and tenth third jamed with people and ... cars.

27:29.954 --> 27:30.788
{y:i}Repeating ... 

27:30.893 --> 27:36.002
{y:i}that a ... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
{y:i}there are just jamed with both people ...

27:36.106 --> 27:38.296
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

27:39.234 --> 27:42.467
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers ...

27:43.822 --> 27:45.595
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

27:46.220 --> 27:51.434
{y:i}The names of young victims are not yet released,
{y:i}but people would probably recognized,

27:51.538 --> 27:53.832
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

27:58.107 --> 27:58.941
{y:i}Now ...

27:59.046 --> 27:59.880
{y:i}back ...

27:59.984 --> 28:01.653
{y:i}to Dementia ...

28:31.474 --> 28:32.829
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

28:39.294 --> 28:41.067
Julie saw him you know.

28:42.422 --> 28:43.257
Who?

28:43.674 --> 28:45.342
Michael Myers.

28:45.446 --> 28:46.698
Come on.

28:46.802 --> 28:48.887
I swear. Yesterday, when she was coming to work.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.555
Where did she see him?

28:51.598 --> 28:53.684
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

28:54.414 --> 28:55.873
Well, she stopped at the light ... 

28:56.082 --> 28:59.314
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

29:00.983 --> 29:04.215
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

29:04.424 --> 29:06.405
He didn't escape until last night.

29:08.907 --> 29:10.471
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

29:10.576 --> 29:12.765
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

29:13.078 --> 29:16.102
Every other word you say is either hell or shit or damn.

29:17.353 --> 29:18.396
I'm sorry. 

29:19.022 --> 29:21.003
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

29:33.411 --> 29:34.245
Hi.

29:37.477 --> 29:38.312
Hey, you're here.

29:38.416 --> 29:39.041
Hi.

29:39.250 --> 29:39.980
You're late.

29:40.084 --> 29:42.587
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward. 

29:43.317 --> 29:44.047
Hi. Jimmy.

29:44.881 --> 29:46.132
Oh, hi. Karen.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.284
Come on.

29:53.222 --> 29:54.474
See you later.

29:54.682 --> 29:55.412
Great.

29:59.687 --> 30:01.877
* Amazing grace ... *

30:02.294 --> 30:04.796
* come sit on my face *

30:05.839 --> 30:07.612
* Don't make me cry ... *

30:07.716 --> 30:09.593
* I need your pie *

30:09.697 --> 30:11.678
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

30:12.408 --> 30:13.764
What do you all worked up about?

30:13.868 --> 30:15.119
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

30:15.224 --> 30:17.622
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there. 

30:17.726 --> 30:19.499
All right, so what do you want me to do?

30:20.541 --> 30:21.167
Look Jimmy ...

30:21.376 --> 30:24.087
Rule number one: never get involved with a patient.

30:24.712 --> 30:25.651
Nurses ...

30:25.963 --> 30:27.423
that's another story.

30:27.528 --> 30:30.134
But patients is no good. It never works out.

30:31.594 --> 30:33.367
Where you going college boy?

30:33.784 --> 30:35.765
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

31:46.044 --> 31:47.712
You were late again tonight.

31:50.110 --> 31:51.570
Just fifteen minutes.

31:51.674 --> 31:55.011
That could be the difference
between life and death for one of those kids.

31:56.471 --> 31:59.807
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

32:00.016 --> 32:01.684
You're a good nurse Karen.

32:01.788 --> 32:02.623
I'd hate to loose you.

32:02.727 --> 32:04.604
But you've got to learn to be on time.

32:04.812 --> 32:06.272
Now. Let's get over this list.

32:06.689 --> 32:09.400
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

32:11.486 --> 32:11.903
Carr ... 

32:12.111 --> 32:14.197
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

32:14.405 --> 32:15.448
God, they should have ...

32:15.552 --> 32:17.533
They should have handled him more carefully.

32:18.576 --> 32:19.410
Who?

32:21.079 --> 32:22.434
Michael Myers.

32:24.624 --> 32:26.084
Michael Myers?

32:27.543 --> 32:28.169
Yea, he ... 

32:28.273 --> 32:29.629
He was that guy, that was after you.

32:33.591 --> 32:35.155
You mean the Myers house?

32:38.596 --> 32:41.307
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

32:45.061 --> 32:46.938
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

32:47.042 --> 32:48.815
He escaped last night.

32:49.128 --> 32:50.170
How do you know?

32:50.796 --> 32:52.256
It's all over the radio.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.550
Television too. It's on right now.

33:00.493 --> 33:01.744
Why me?

33:04.247 --> 33:05.915
I mean, why me?

33:08.626 --> 33:10.086
Times up Jimmy.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.067
Let's go.

33:12.171 --> 33:13.214
OK. ok.

33:18.428 --> 33:19.679
No you won't!

33:19.887 --> 33:21.973
Visiting hours are definitely over.

33:25.727 --> 33:28.542
Men ... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

33:29.376 --> 33:31.044
How's that shoulder feel?

33:31.983 --> 33:33.130
A little better.

33:33.338 --> 33:34.381
Good.

33:34.902 --> 33:37.196
We've been trying to get ahold of your parents.

33:37.926 --> 33:42.410
Dr. Mixter told me, they were at the same party he was,
but they're not there now and they're not at home.

33:42.723 --> 33:44.704
Do you have any idea of where else they might be?

33:46.164 --> 33:47.102
No.

33:48.249 --> 33:49.813
I'll just keep trying.

34:00.553 --> 34:01.700
Oh, this is just ...

34:03.368 --> 34:04.411
Janet?

34:07.748 --> 34:08.895
Yes Mrs. Alves.

34:09.103 --> 34:11.293
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having trouble with the phones.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.648
Right now.

34:13.274 --> 34:15.464
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

34:16.507 --> 34:18.070
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

34:20.989 --> 34:22.554
What's wrong with the phones?

34:24.534 --> 34:26.411
Nothing for you to worry about.

34:27.038 --> 34:28.810
Just get some rest right now.

34:29.123 --> 34:31.626
I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.

35:00.613 --> 35:02.073
I'm gonna go check the phone.

35:02.281 --> 35:04.784
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

35:04.993 --> 35:08.851
It'll take me five minutes.
- But I don't even know, how to use this thing!

38:08.613 --> 38:12.680
I think somebody broke into the store room.
{y:i}The lock was off.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.415
Mr. Garrett?

38:19.353 --> 38:20.917
I can't hear you.

38:22.794 --> 38:26.236
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

38:32.074 --> 38:34.577
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

38:34.681 --> 38:35.724
Janet!

39:03.669 --> 39:05.129
Mr. Garrett.

40:04.459 --> 40:05.710
Mr. Garrett?

40:09.255 --> 40:12.175
Mr. Garrett ... I gotta get back on the floor.

40:15.616 --> 40:16.658
Hello?

40:32.820 --> 40:34.176
It's difficult.

40:34.384 --> 40:36.574
Even the gums are charred but ... 

40:36.887 --> 40:37.930
... look here.

40:39.702 --> 40:40.745
See here?

40:41.162 --> 40:42.622
No fillings.

40:42.830 --> 40:46.167
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.148
Michael Myers is 21.

40:48.774 --> 40:51.798
Positive ID means we check x-rays and dental records.

40:51.902 --> 40:53.362
That'll take hours!

40:53.466 --> 40:56.803
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

40:56.907 --> 41:00.556
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

41:05.249 --> 41:06.708
Everybody goes back out.

41:06.813 --> 41:08.064
But we just closed it up.

41:08.168 --> 41:11.296
I want to sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass.

41:11.401 --> 41:12.443
I want every street ...

41:12.652 --> 41:13.903
every house ...

41:14.529 --> 41:16.197
every backyard.

41:16.822 --> 41:17.865
Ok.

41:18.178 --> 41:19.325
You've got it.

41:24.226 --> 41:25.164
Thank you.

41:34.653 --> 41:41.431
All right, that's enough. That's enough!
Now come on, get out of here. You guys, go home.

41:50.711 --> 41:55.924
This is Hunt in another vehicle.
The old Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

41:56.445 --> 41:59.365
One of their number was butchered, this is a wake.

42:05.830 --> 42:08.124
Heightens my sense of security.

42:21.679 --> 42:23.452
All right. Knock it off!

42:24.599 --> 42:26.789
Come on folks, go home.

42:27.935 --> 42:29.291
Knock it off!!!

42:32.523 --> 42:33.358
Empty.

42:33.462 --> 42:36.486
Plus we've covered the whole east end of town.
There's nothing.

42:36.590 --> 42:37.529
Check it again.

42:37.737 --> 42:39.196
He just isn't here. 

42:39.405 --> 42:40.761
CHECK IT again!

42:42.846 --> 42:43.680
You know.

42:44.410 --> 42:47.017
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.

42:47.226 --> 42:48.164
The only a ...

42:48.372 --> 42:50.249
gunshot you ever heard 

42:50.771 --> 42:52.961
were start tracking for the local highschool.

42:53.273 --> 42:56.401
Yet one night in 1963 Michael Myers ... 

42:56.923 --> 43:00.259
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large ... 

43:00.468 --> 43:01.824
butcher knife.

43:02.345 --> 43:03.596
I remember.

43:03.805 --> 43:06.516
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.

43:07.037 --> 43:09.227
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

43:10.478 --> 43:11.729
He came back.

43:12.251 --> 43:14.127
After fifteen years?

43:14.440 --> 43:17.151
He waited with extraordinary patience,

43:18.611 --> 43:19.550
There was a ... 

43:19.654 --> 43:22.469
force inside him biding its time. 

43:23.408 --> 43:27.579
The stuff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence.

43:28.413 --> 43:32.166
In many ways he was the ideal patient.
He didn't talked he didn't ... 

43:32.583 --> 43:34.982
cry. He didn't even move.

43:35.294 --> 43:36.858
He just waited. 

43:37.484 --> 43:39.987
The staff was unprepared they didn't ... 

43:40.508 --> 43:42.593
know, what he was.

43:43.219 --> 43:44.470
Did you know?

43:45.409 --> 43:46.660
Yea I knew.

43:46.764 --> 43:47.807
Excuse me.

43:48.433 --> 43:49.371
Mr. Hunt?

43:50.205 --> 43:54.689
Yea. What is it Craig? - Yea. I'm worried about
Bennet Tramer. - He isn't home yet.

43:54.897 --> 43:56.566
It's only a little after ... 

43:56.670 --> 43:57.817
eleven boys.

43:57.921 --> 43:59.277
He was real drunk.

43:59.590 --> 44:00.528
How old is he?

44:00.632 --> 44:01.988
Seventeen.

44:02.092 --> 44:04.073
He had this stupid mask on.

44:04.490 --> 44:05.741
All right boys.

44:06.576 --> 44:07.514
Seventeen ...

44:07.618 --> 44:09.287
... and wearing a mask.

44:10.747 --> 44:13.666
Oh god.
- We should check his dental records.

44:15.335 --> 44:19.505
Old reservoir road. They had break-in the
elementary school. They're pretty sure it's him. - Come on!

45:17.376 --> 45:18.523
Oh, stop.

45:19.252 --> 45:21.025
Aw, shit!

45:21.547 --> 45:24.154
Shit. - Oh, you idiot!

45:24.466 --> 45:25.821
You could've broken it.

45:26.656 --> 45:28.428
I wish I had!

45:30.410 --> 45:33.017
I also could have used these on you.

45:34.685 --> 45:36.040
What an asshole.

45:36.144 --> 45:37.396
Happy Halloween.

45:39.168 --> 45:40.107
Budd ...

45:40.420 --> 45:42.505
you are the biggest jerk ... 

45:42.713 --> 45:44.173
I've ever met.

45:47.823 --> 45:49.074
But you love me.

45:50.221 --> 45:51.472
Yeah ...

45:52.515 --> 45:53.871
I'm an idiot.

46:02.838 --> 46:05.445
Let's go down to the therapy room.

46:06.487 --> 46:08.885
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

46:10.033 --> 46:12.118
I can't leave the kids right now.

46:12.222 --> 46:14.204
Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?

46:14.412 --> 46:16.393
All this Michael Myers crap.

46:17.748 --> 46:18.687
I just ...

46:21.190 --> 46:22.336
I just want ...

46:41.522 --> 46:43.503
The therapy room's three doors down.

46:48.091 --> 46:53.931
I suppose if we left the door open, we could hear if
somebody is coming ... or if the kids started to cry ...

46:54.765 --> 46:57.580
No. I ... I got to check it out first.

46:58.310 --> 46:59.457
Fifteen minutes.

47:01.751 --> 47:03.628
If everything's ok.

47:04.775 --> 47:06.130
You're wasting time.

47:18.017 --> 47:19.581
{y:i}Why don't you tell me?

47:20.415 --> 47:22.709
{y:i}Why don't you ever tell me anything?

47:23.335 --> 47:24.586
I told you ...

47:25.316 --> 47:27.089
I'm NOT your mother.

49:02.914 --> 49:03.748
It's hot.

49:31.901 --> 49:33.361
It's hot in here.

49:35.342 --> 49:36.385
It's just me.

49:51.087 --> 49:52.547
I'm not kidding. 

49:53.902 --> 49:55.883
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

49:56.196 --> 49:57.447
Why don't you go check?

49:59.637 --> 50:00.888
It's cold out there.

50:02.557 --> 50:04.746
It can get cold in here.

50:07.770 --> 50:08.709
Gotcha.

51:24.305 --> 51:25.765
Forget it, Budd.

51:25.974 --> 51:27.433
I have to go back to work.

51:34.732 --> 51:36.818
You wanna go for breakfast later?

51:40.363 --> 51:41.510
No ...

51:46.828 --> 51:47.975
I'm sorry.

51:50.790 --> 51:52.875
I just have to get back. That's all.

51:54.961 --> 51:57.150
Now. Budd, don't be that way.

52:35.939 --> 52:37.399
He got in here.

52:38.963 --> 52:40.214
And look over here.

52:49.182 --> 52:50.642
And here ...

52:59.087 --> 53:00.234
Sister.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.362
Is that it?

53:03.675 --> 53:04.614
No.

53:05.448 --> 53:06.282
Here.

53:13.372 --> 53:14.519
What's this?

53:14.832 --> 53:16.396
It's gibberish.

53:16.501 --> 53:17.439
No.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.420
It's a celtic word.

53:20.463 --> 53:21.506
Samhain ...

53:22.653 --> 53:24.634
It means the Lord of the dead.

53:25.572 --> 53:26.823
The end of summer.

53:28.283 --> 53:29.535
The festival ...

53:29.639 --> 53:31.307
of samhain.

53:32.037 --> 53:33.601
October 31st.

53:35.582 --> 53:36.834
Dr. Loomis?

53:36.938 --> 53:37.876
Yes?

53:39.023 --> 53:41.004
I have to talk to you.

53:42.881 --> 53:44.550
Oh, I didn't recognize you. 

53:45.697 --> 53:47.156
What are you doing here?

53:47.573 --> 53:48.929
Privately.

53:59.669 --> 54:00.607
Thanks.

54:02.171 --> 54:03.318
Dr. Loomis ...

54:03.631 --> 54:05.925
You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.

54:06.342 --> 54:07.385
Ordered?

54:07.802 --> 54:10.513
He can't order me.
- No, no ...

54:10.826 --> 54:12.390
but the governor can.

54:12.494 --> 54:15.727
He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.
- The Governor ...

54:16.456 --> 54:17.603
well, well ...

54:17.812 --> 54:20.731
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.

54:21.149 --> 54:26.779
Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.
You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.

54:26.884 --> 54:29.073
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

54:29.490 --> 54:31.263
I know. I'm sorry.

54:32.410 --> 54:36.372
Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could jeapordize
our whole rehabilitation program.

54:36.477 --> 54:42.003
He doesn't want anyone from the mental
health department anywhere near Haddonfield.

54:43.776 --> 54:45.652
In case you already found him.

54:45.965 --> 54:48.050
... alive.
- Tell Dr. Rogers ...

54:48.155 --> 54:52.221
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.
I can't leave Haddonfield now.

54:52.638 --> 54:54.620
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

54:55.975 --> 54:58.999
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

55:15.578 --> 55:16.725
Laurie ...

55:21.521 --> 55:22.669
listen ...

55:24.337 --> 55:25.588
I know that ... 

55:25.797 --> 55:27.569
you don't know me very well.

55:28.508 --> 55:30.697
But I just wanna let you to know that ...  

55:31.949 --> 55:34.451
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

55:34.764 --> 55:35.807
Ok?

55:36.954 --> 55:37.684
Promise.

55:43.418 --> 55:44.565
Laurie.

55:52.907 --> 55:54.054
Shit!

56:10.529 --> 56:11.988
Dr. Mixter?!

56:15.117 --> 56:16.577
Dr. Mixter.

56:21.790 --> 56:23.354
Dr. Mixter!

56:40.038 --> 56:41.706
Dr. Mixter?

56:46.294 --> 56:47.545
Dr. Mixter ...

56:47.649 --> 56:49.214
It's an emergency!

56:57.555 --> 57:00.058
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

57:00.370 --> 57:02.352
She's had a reaction to the medication.

57:02.769 --> 57:04.437
You better come quick.

57:09.546 --> 57:11.006
Dr. Mixter.

57:53.027 --> 57:55.321
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

58:04.706 --> 58:06.165
Mrs. Alves?

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:11.812
Laurie?

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.272
You ok?

01:02:39.772 --> 01:02:41.023
We will find him.

01:02:41.753 --> 01:02:43.109
Where're you gonna look?

01:02:43.735 --> 01:02:44.986
I don't know.

01:02:46.445 --> 01:02:47.697
Neither do I.

01:03:17.518 --> 01:03:18.978
Mr. Garrett?

01:03:43.795 --> 01:03:45.880
Mr. Garrett!?

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.825
Mr. Garrett?

01:04:16.327 --> 01:04:17.996
Mr. Garrett?

01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:20.915
Sorry.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:22.792
Listen ...

01:04:24.043 --> 01:04:25.607
I can't find anybody.

01:04:26.337 --> 01:04:27.588
Budd's gone ...
Mrs. Alves is gone.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.863
We gotta find Laurie.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.323
All right, listen.

01:04:34.887 --> 01:04:36.973
Why don't you check the East wing again?

01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:38.120
All right?

01:04:38.537 --> 01:04:43.646
And if you don't find anyone, I want you to
get into your car and drive out to the sheriff's station.

01:04:45.001 --> 01:04:45.732
All right?

01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:48.755
Ok.

01:04:49.172 --> 01:04:49.694
Ok.

01:04:49.903 --> 01:04:51.049
I'll keep looking.

01:05:11.591 --> 01:05:12.529
Hello?

01:05:45.896 --> 01:05:47.043
Jesus.

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:33.667
Laurie!

01:08:37.734 --> 01:08:38.673
Laurie.

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.341
Laurie wait!

01:08:43.782 --> 01:08:45.136
Wait Laurie ...

01:13:27.086 --> 01:13:28.963
He didn't believe me and now they're dead.

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:31.466
I'm sorry.

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:33.134
Don't feel sorry for me.

01:13:33.655 --> 01:13:35.740
Feel sorry for that little town back there.

01:13:36.262 --> 01:13:38.139
It'll be years before they forget this.

01:13:40.224 --> 01:13:43.040
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else
you should know.

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:46.481
You see the blackboard
back there in the Elementary school?

01:13:46.793 --> 01:13:47.941
Yea?

01:13:48.566 --> 01:13:50.234
In order to appease the gods,

01:13:50.339 --> 01:13:54.301
the druid priests ... held ... fire ... rituals.

01:13:54.509 --> 01:13:57.429
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane ...

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.784
animals ...

01:13:59.097 --> 01:14:00.036
were ...

01:14:01.079 --> 01:14:02.434
burned alive

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.207
in baskets.

01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:09.316
By observing the way they died, the druids believed,
they could see omens of the future.

01:14:11.089 --> 01:14:14.216
2000 years later we've come no further.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.241
Samhain isn't ... 

01:14:17.344 --> 01:14:19.013
evil spirits.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.767
It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:26.833
it's the unconscious mind.

01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:31.630
We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.113
Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.

01:14:36.218 --> 01:14:40.180
There's a file on Michael Myers, that nobody knew about.
- I've seen everything. - No.

01:14:40.284 --> 01:14:44.455
No. It was hidden.
Sealed by the court after his parents were killed.

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:50.503
Now after the Governor heard what happened tonight,
he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:51.963
What file?

01:14:53.423 --> 01:14:54.674
It isn't fair.

01:14:54.778 --> 01:14:57.280
They should've allowed you to examine everything.

01:14:58.636 --> 01:14:59.679
That girl ... 

01:14:59.887 --> 01:15:03.432
that Strode girl, that's Michael Myers sister.

01:15:04.892 --> 01:15:06.144
She was born ... 

01:15:06.248 --> 01:15:08.020
2 years before he was commited.

01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:11.983
Two years after ... his parents died
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

01:15:12.087 --> 01:15:18.239
They requested, that the records be sealed
in order to protect the family. - Jeez, don't you see,

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:21.680
He killed one sister fifteen years ago.
Now he's trying to kill the other!

01:15:22.827 --> 01:15:25.538
Tonight after I shot him, where did they take her?

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:26.998
The clinic.

01:15:27.206 --> 01:15:29.605
Clinic where? Do you know this area well?

01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:30.752
A little bit.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.297
Where's the hospital located?
- Dr. Loomis we're under orders from the Governor!

01:15:34.505 --> 01:15:36.591
It's back around Seventeen about three miles.

01:15:36.695 --> 01:15:38.363
Turn this car around now!

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:40.344
I can't do that. I've got orders.

01:15:40.553 --> 01:15:43.472
Those orders have changed!
- Dr. Loomis!

01:15:43.577 --> 01:15:45.767
Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.

01:15:45.871 --> 01:15:49.207
What is your fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

01:16:23.825 --> 01:16:24.659
Jimmy?

01:16:34.253 --> 01:16:35.191
It's all right.

01:16:36.338 --> 01:16:37.381
We're ...

01:16:37.902 --> 01:16:39.779
Ok, we're gonna get out of here.

01:16:51.144 --> 01:16:52.396
I think, I think ... 

01:17:48.285 --> 01:17:52.039
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel,
but I have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.

01:17:52.143 --> 01:17:53.290
Can I trust you?

01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:55.688
What have I got to loose ... 

01:17:55.792 --> 01:17:57.148
except my job?

01:17:58.817 --> 01:18:00.068
I need help ...

01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:04.134
Help ...

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:06.845
Help ... me.

01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:10.911
HELP ME!!

01:18:19.358 --> 01:18:21.026
Go and check all the rooms down there.

01:18:21.131 --> 01:18:22.173
Go on!

01:18:22.278 --> 01:18:24.466
Dr. Loomis.
- You stay with me and shut up.

01:18:58.147 --> 01:18:59.294
HELP!

01:19:02.109 --> 01:19:03.047
HELP!

01:19:05.133 --> 01:19:06.592

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:08.886

01:19:15.559 --> 01:19:16.602
HELP!!

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:20.982
PLEASE!

01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.859
PLEASE!

01:19:24.319 --> 01:19:25.362
PLEASE!

01:19:28.906 --> 01:19:29.949
Come on, get in!

01:20:04.671 --> 01:20:05.610
Stop!

01:20:05.818 --> 01:20:06.549
He is dead!

01:20:06.652 --> 01:20:07.800
No, he's not. Look at him!

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.051
He's still breathing.

01:20:11.344 --> 01:20:12.179
Ok.

01:20:14.472 --> 01:20:17.288
There's a two way radio over in the marshall's car.
I want you to go outside.

01:20:17.392 --> 01:20:19.373
Get on that radio and get help!

01:20:20.104 --> 01:20:21.355
Now wait a minute.

01:20:21.668 --> 01:20:23.857
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

01:20:23.961 --> 01:20:24.900
Move!

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:30.426
I'm sorry I left you. 

01:20:31.052 --> 01:20:32.095
Are you all right?

01:20:36.057 --> 01:20:37.308
Why won't he die?

01:20:40.228 --> 01:20:41.583
Get away from him!

01:20:41.687 --> 01:20:43.147
But he's stopped breathing!

01:20:43.356 --> 01:20:44.190
No!

01:21:50.923 --> 01:21:52.591
{y:i}Unit calling. Identify.

01:21:52.696 --> 01:21:56.345
Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis at the clinic. He's here.

01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:59.265
{y:i}10-4. Unit calling. Indentify suspect.

01:21:59.369 --> 01:22:02.602
Michael Myers! Just get your ass over here!

01:22:32.736 --> 01:22:34.717
Take that gun. Come on!
- No.

01:22:34.925 --> 01:22:35.968
Take it.

01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:37.845
Take it!

01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:31.232
Michael?!
