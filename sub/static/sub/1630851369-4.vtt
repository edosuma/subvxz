First generation antipsychotic.

Heavy dose.

09:47.369 --> 09:50.764

says he never misses a dose,

10:22.491 --> 10:25.581
Pam, let me show you
to the waiting room, okay?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.365
- Cardiac output and index.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.237
Pulse pressure
and stroke volumes.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.109
Central venous pressure,
mean arterial pressure,

10:32.153 --> 10:35.417
and calculated values
like oxygen delivery.

10:35.460 --> 10:40.161
The Vas-COM is the all-in-one

Almost.

- Dr. Cooper.

- So with Covid cases,
it can be useful

10:49.518 --> 10:51.215
to quantify pulmonary edema.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.130
Is that something the Vas-COM
is capable of?

Absolutely.

about lung water volume or...

11:14.195 --> 11:15.979
It can be calculated
in seconds.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.285

11:17.328 --> 11:19.983
the Vas-COM's sophisticated
neural network AI.

This, in combination with
a thermistor at the tip

11:22.899 --> 11:25.293
of the central venous line
and the waveform analysis

11:25.336 --> 11:28.122
from the arterial side
ensures the device delivers

11:28.165 --> 11:29.993
consistent and accurate
measurements.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.648
And it's minimally invasive.

are pretty pricey, right?

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

it's a fair point.

Dr. Halstead?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.185

11:48.229 --> 11:49.926
I mean, the Vas-COM is
more expensive

11:49.970 --> 11:51.493
than other devices,
but it's certainly

11:51.536 --> 11:53.538
not overpriced considering
the multitude of functions

11:53.582 --> 11:54.539
it's capable of.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.019
- Oh, yeah, I mean, it is

11:56.063 --> 12:00.023
a Swiss army knife,
there's no doubt about that.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.721
- Dr. Archer,
that's not a bad thing.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.288
- Uh, no, but it's
not necessary, either.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.421
At the end of the day,
the Vas-COM just seems

12:06.464 --> 12:09.729

of all the hemodynamic devices

12:09.772 --> 12:10.991

pressure's been working

20:16.954 --> 20:18.391

What's going on?

20:18.434 --> 20:19.957
- So you need surgery.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.351
Your stomach pain is
from a tear in your GI tract.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.135
Air is leaking into your belly.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.964
- Leaking?
How does that happen?

20:27.008 --> 20:28.531
- Well, around here,
typically I see it

20:28.575 --> 20:32.013
from penetrative trauma, uh,
bullets, stab wounds...

20:41.588 --> 20:44.155
- Sorry, man, no liquids
before surgery.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.552
Hey, your elixir.
I saw you eating ice.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.988
Is that always
part of the process?

20:51.032 --> 20:55.384
- Yeah, chewing on a cold cube
is just satisfying.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.821
- Well, I think one
might have caused the tear.

20:57.865 --> 20:58.996
Yeah, it's likely
been getting bigger

20:59.040 --> 21:00.955
with each cube
you've swallowed since.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.392
- Seriously? An ice cube?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.089
- It's looking that way.
- What's up?

21:05.133 --> 21:06.961
- Hey, so this is the surgeon.
I'm gonna fill him in,

21:07.004 --> 21:08.484
then he's gonna take over,
okay?

21:10.051 --> 21:11.357
- [groans]

21:11.400 --> 21:12.445
- Pneumoperitoneum.

21:12.488 --> 21:13.968
I suspect the tear's
somewhere near

21:14.011 --> 21:15.361
the gastro-esophageal junction.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.058
- Yeah, there's no blood.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.364
- Ah, wasn't shot or stabbed.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.148
I think an ice cube
went down the wrong way.

- Get out, really?
All right, cool.

Not in the greatest shape,
either.

21:31.551 --> 21:34.205
Post-surgery, I think
cardiac monitoring

21:34.249 --> 21:35.468
would be appropriate.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.862

use the Vas-COM?

21:38.906 --> 21:42.257
I know you like
your old-school CVP,

21:42.301 --> 21:44.346
but I do think the Vas-COM
might be better suited

21:44.390 --> 21:46.000
for this patient.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.524
- Well, I'll consider it.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.004
- Thank you.

No. I'll stick with my device.

ball buster, huh?

22:08.849 --> 22:10.938
- Yeah, he enjoys it, too.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.461
But still, part of me hoped

22:12.505 --> 22:15.943
he would at least
consider the Vas-COM.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.945
- You mind if I offer you
a little advice?

22:17.988 --> 22:19.076

22:19.120 --> 22:20.339

22:20.382 --> 22:22.166
the Vas-COM's positives.
You nailed it.

22:22.210 --> 22:25.866
But you whiffed on pointing out
the CVP's negatives.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.216
That monitor has to be
leveled and calibrated

22:28.259 --> 22:30.261
before each use.
- Right.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.872
- But what if
that's not done appropriately?

22:34.178 --> 22:35.266
All the numbers are off.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.877
None of that data
can be trusted.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.314
- A bad calibration
in the moment.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.968
That's happened before?

22:41.011 --> 22:44.406
- Not to me.
Because I use a Vas-COM.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.844
- [chuckles]
- Anyway, food for thought.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.193
You know, as we move
toward Grand Rounds.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.329
- See? Right there.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.853
CT shows the wall
of the aorta has thickened.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.594
I think it's an aortic tumor.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.161
- No way.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.337
Thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.470
- I don't know, the walls
are abnormally shaped.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.167
Aneurysms are symmetrical.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.429
- It isn't a classic
presentation,

23:07.473 --> 23:08.865
I'll give you that,
but aortic tumors

23:08.909 --> 23:12.173
are super rare,
aortic aneurysms are not.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.786

a curveball.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.962

'cause that's a fast ball.

Thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm.

with that diagnosis.

Dr. Marcel.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.099

23:25.142 --> 23:26.100

23:26.143 --> 23:27.144

23:32.367 --> 23:33.629
- How's it going?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.892

four cases in which

23:35.936 --> 23:39.330

of anaplastic astrocytoma,

23:39.374 --> 23:42.072

to be misdiagnoses.

isn't another medical miracle.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.642
