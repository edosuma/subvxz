in Los Angeles this weekend

04:52.492 --> 04:53.960
Mary Anne and I could switch
to the L. A. flight

04:53.994 --> 04:55.562
and meet you there.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.897

be terrific.

we could get together

we can go to Disneyland.

the sunset from the Sunset Strip

05:08.408 --> 05:10.744
and we can play polo
at the Polo Lounge

at the Hollywood Bowl.

for two coach seats

05:30.030 --> 05:31.497
and then Balki could come.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.337
Balki, you wouldn’t wanna go
to L. A., would you?

‐Where are we?
‐I don’t know.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.057
But we better get outta here.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.868
Oh, relax, Jennifer.
We’re only a few minutes late.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.969
Well, we wouldn’t have
been late at all

13:23.003 --> 13:25.572
if you hadn’t spent so much time
talking to that guy.

13:25.606 --> 13:27.841
He was a movie producer.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.943
He was driving
an ice cream truck.

Oh, damn it, Sheila.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.064
Why did we have to rent this
stupid bicycle?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.899
Because we’re on vacation.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.301
And riding bicycles is
what people do in California.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.671
It’s something
I want to do in California.

Now don’t do that.
What are you doing?

14:43.249 --> 14:45.485
I‐’m sorry.
I know what you must think.

14:45.519 --> 14:48.655
But you see, we‐we‐we were at
Darla Wayne’s wedding

a murder, there was a murder.

and before they cut the cake‐‐

it was a natural mistake.

17:27.548 --> 17:29.182
You said, "Jump."

17:29.215 --> 17:31.151
Well, cousin, I, I didn’t mean
jump into the water.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.519
Well, if you didn’t mean
jump into the water

17:32.553 --> 17:34.588
you should have said,
Jump, but not into the water.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.189
Learn to be specific.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.691
But, cousin, I‐I didn’t know
you were going to

17:37.724 --> 17:38.859
jump into the water.

17:38.892 --> 17:39.860
You could have hurt yourself.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.361
Oh, I certainly wouldn’t
want to hurt myself

17:41.394 --> 17:43.229
when people are
trying to kill me.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.631
Cousin, we got to get
to the police.

17:44.665 --> 17:45.699
They’ll protect us.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.834
We can’t go to the police.

Two hundred people saw
a dead man in my arms

17:51.204 --> 17:54.407
while I was holding the murder
weapon over his lifeless body.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.209
Cousin, I videotaped
the murder.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.078
The‐the tape will
prove us innocent.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.515
Well, has it occurred
to you that there might not

18:01.548 --> 18:03.449
be anything
on that tape?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.752
You are not the world’s greatest
cameraman, you know.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.657
Now why don’t we just
play that tape back?

18:10.691 --> 18:13.293
Well, cousin, that’s
going to be a little tough.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.861
Well, no, it’s not gonna be
a little tough.

on the play button and push.

has been replaced...

Okay, okay, alright.
It’s not the end of the world.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.215
All we need is
to‐to find someplace

18:35.248 --> 18:36.750
where we can
playback the tape.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.218
A‐a video store.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.721
Uh, oh, okay, all we need
is the yellow pages.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.290
Of course, uh, we’re not
familiar with the city.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.827
So‐so, we’ll‐we’ll‐we’ll
have to get a map.

All we need is
the yellow pages and a map.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.632
Of course, we have
no transportation.

So‐so, uh, we‐we’ll
get a bus schedule.

So all we need is the yellow
pages, a map and a bus schedule.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.405

world or what?

You’re never gonna
guess what happened to us.

into that nice couple again

to lend us their car

generous of them.
