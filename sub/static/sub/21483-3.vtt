00:00.764 --> 00:03.015
Hi, I'm Andre Nowzick.

00:03.135 --> 00:04.820
I'm a successful
plastic surgeon.

00:04.822 --> 00:07.756
But I'm also a
single human person.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.303
Experience Andre.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.868
(grunts)

00:15.870 --> 00:17.737
I sweat like a man.

00:17.739 --> 00:19.230
And I smell like... Ow!

00:19.286 --> 00:21.293
(deep voice): I work
the street like a man.

00:21.295 --> 00:24.028
I order my steak
rare like a man.

00:24.030 --> 00:25.999
(chimp screeches)

00:28.671 --> 00:30.717
Taco?! What are you doing?

00:30.837 --> 00:32.978
TACO: Say, "I operate
on women like a man."

00:32.980 --> 00:34.047
I'm in surgery.

00:34.049 --> 00:36.020
Are those boobs? Gross!

00:36.022 --> 00:37.223
Are you eating in here?

00:37.225 --> 00:38.325
I'm just snacking. Chip?

00:38.327 --> 00:40.331
No. Get out of here!

00:40.451 --> 00:41.458
Experience Andre.

00:51.001 --> 00:53.085
RUXIN: Anyway, after this
Sukkot fiasco, does not look

00:53.114 --> 00:55.767
like baby Jeffrey will be
attending a Jewish preschool.

00:55.887 --> 00:57.796
But I think I found
a better solution.

00:57.916 --> 00:59.683
I'm going to hire
some live-in help.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.351
KEVIN: Wait.

01:00.353 --> 01:02.821
You're not talking about...
Indeed, I am.

01:02.823 --> 01:05.891
I am getting an au pair.

01:05.893 --> 01:07.359
PETE: Oh, no.

01:07.361 --> 01:08.460
Oh, yeah.

01:08.462 --> 01:09.628
Son of a bitch.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.498
I've always wanted an au pair.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.333
I want a kid so I can
have an au pair.

01:13.335 --> 01:15.535
Even the words au pair, they just, like...
Au pair!

01:15.537 --> 01:17.236
Son of a...
don't make that face.

01:17.238 --> 01:18.637
Au pair!

01:18.639 --> 01:19.905
(grunts) Pair!

01:19.907 --> 01:23.476
Ooh, hey, ooh!

01:23.478 --> 01:28.714
Hello, champion of the dating video.
Whoo!

01:28.716 --> 01:30.682
All due to this guy right here, Mr.
Taco.

01:30.684 --> 01:31.550
I gotta ask.

01:31.552 --> 01:34.252
Have you just been getting a
bunch of numbers from dudes?

01:34.254 --> 01:36.787
Guys, online dating is a
perfectly acceptable way for

01:36.789 --> 01:41.392
those society has shunned to get together
and ideally colonize another planet.

01:41.394 --> 01:45.329
No, no, I'm not judging on the concept,
just mortified by the execution.

01:45.331 --> 01:48.433
Yeah, what's up with the images
of the animals having sex?

01:48.435 --> 01:50.335
Is that...
Those were subliminal messages.

01:50.337 --> 01:52.804
Taco, they can't be subliminal
if they're on for 20 seconds.

01:52.806 --> 01:53.638
That's just obvious.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.608
No, obvious would be human beings having
sex, and Andre made me take those

01:57.610 --> 01:58.375
images out.

01:58.377 --> 02:01.545
My video went viral, and the women
have been coming in in droves.

02:01.547 --> 02:02.312
Really?

02:02.314 --> 02:06.483
Look what the cat dragged in...
if the cat was into dragging in chicks.

02:06.485 --> 02:09.353
If we're looking at photos, I got
some photos of, au pair applicants.

02:09.354 --> 02:09.787
All right.

02:09.788 --> 02:11.888
Let's do a little...
Let's do a little photo-off here.

02:11.890 --> 02:12.756
Let's see what we got.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.623
See what we got.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.491
All right, well, let's
get rid of any man.

02:15.493 --> 02:16.492
That is not the point.

02:16.494 --> 02:17.226
Let me see.

02:17.228 --> 02:20.463
We need someone who can cook, must be
good with kids, must know how to read.

02:20.465 --> 02:23.533
Actually, I have the same requirements,
but, uh, I don't care that much about

02:23.535 --> 02:23.867
the reading.

02:23.869 --> 02:25.035
Okay, this is the one.

02:25.037 --> 02:26.437
Ashley R. This is my girl.

02:26.439 --> 02:27.838
This is... Oh, my God.
She's adorable.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.908
I'm going to go on the record and say
that I think this is a bad idea.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.477
You're inviting trouble
into your house.

02:32.479 --> 02:32.911
Temptation.

02:32.913 --> 02:34.613
I'm not gonna try
to sleep with her.

02:34.615 --> 02:35.547
Have you seen my wife?

02:35.549 --> 02:36.381
She's crazy hot.

02:36.383 --> 02:37.049
Yeah, super hot.

02:37.051 --> 02:40.053
Yeah, I need Jeffrey to get used to
hanging out with super hot women.

02:40.055 --> 02:43.723
I don't want my kid going to the park and
getting his dong cleaned by some uggo

02:43.725 --> 02:44.758
with a 'stache.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.826
She's in high school.

02:45.828 --> 02:47.395
Your au pair needs an au pair.

02:47.397 --> 02:48.829
Oh, double au pair.

02:48.831 --> 02:50.431
Double au pair!

02:50.433 --> 02:51.933
Ooh, ooh!

02:51.935 --> 02:53.067
What are we doing?

02:53.069 --> 02:55.070
I don't know how this
thing's gonna play out.

02:55.072 --> 02:57.272
She's gonna be in the house
24/7, always around.

02:57.274 --> 02:59.307
JENNY: Ruxin is
going to hate that.

02:59.309 --> 02:59.741
I know.

02:59.743 --> 03:00.909
I feel bad for the girl.

03:00.911 --> 03:01.777
She cute?

03:01.779 --> 03:03.412
What? No.

03:03.414 --> 03:04.813
Wow. She must be really hot.

03:04.815 --> 03:06.315
Why, why would you say that?

03:06.317 --> 03:08.684
Because you said, "What? No."

03:08.686 --> 03:09.251
What?

03:09.253 --> 03:11.020
You say that every time you lie.

03:11.022 --> 03:13.723
What? No. No, I don't.

03:13.725 --> 03:17.628
Please. The night you proposed, I said,
"What's the bulge in your pocket?"

03:17.630 --> 03:20.764
And you said, "What?
I've got testicular cancer."

03:20.766 --> 03:22.332
I was trying to be romantic.

03:22.334 --> 03:23.533
Super romantic.

03:23.535 --> 03:26.503
Um, I need a little help from
you with my lineup, whether I

03:26.505 --> 03:27.871
should play Ochocinco...
No, I can't, babe.

03:27.873 --> 03:28.404
Why?

03:28.406 --> 03:29.572
I have to get back to work.

03:29.574 --> 03:32.041
Sorry.
But really quick though..

03:32.043 --> 03:32.608
Yes?

03:32.610 --> 03:34.910
My laptop is moving super slow.

03:34.912 --> 03:37.046
Have you been looking
at porn on my computer?

03:37.048 --> 03:39.348
What? No. Ooh.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.851
Right. Thank you.

03:41.853 --> 03:43.786
You know what? Ask me again.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.456
Give me, give me the question
one more time. Come on.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.925
Kevin, have you been looking
at porn on my computer?

03:48.927 --> 03:52.379
What? Oh, wow, wow.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.401
See?

03:55.953 --> 03:57.354
ALL: Hi!

03:57.474 --> 03:58.018
What are you doing here?

03:58.138 --> 03:59.861
Oh, I was just checking out
houses in the neighborhood.

03:59.983 --> 04:01.532
There's nothing around
here you can afford.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.566
I thought we had plans.

04:02.568 --> 04:04.134
I never make plans
with you, Andre.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.336
Just lending you that bike
pump you were asking for.

04:06.338 --> 04:08.639
Oh, the one with my name on it
that's in my garage normally?

04:08.641 --> 04:10.540
I'm just here to check
out the au pair.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.941
I appreciate your
transparency, Taco.

04:11.943 --> 04:13.710
I also need to use your urinal.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.745
We don't have a urinal, just
a shower that you pee in.

04:15.747 --> 04:16.144
What?

04:16.147 --> 04:19.380
Look, you guys can all hang out here
and watch the games, but that is it.

04:19.382 --> 04:20.916
Do not blow this for me, okay?

04:20.918 --> 04:21.750
Okay.

04:21.752 --> 04:22.917
Fine.

04:22.919 --> 04:26.688
ASHLEY: Come on, do you want to
play the fishing game with me?

04:26.690 --> 04:27.856
Cool. Got this one?

04:27.858 --> 04:29.157
You don't want to play?

04:29.159 --> 04:30.492
Sorry. Am I distracting you?

04:30.494 --> 04:31.660
ALL: No, no.

04:31.662 --> 04:32.828
I don't mean to.

04:32.830 --> 04:35.163
Football's just
like white noise.

04:35.165 --> 04:36.999
You want to watch, like,
MTV or something?

04:37.001 --> 04:37.866
Oh, that'd be cool.

04:37.868 --> 04:38.467
Mommy?

04:38.469 --> 04:39.468
<i>16 and Pregnant</i> marathon.

04:39.470 --> 04:41.770
Oh, my gosh, I love
<i>16 and Pregnant!</i>

04:41.772 --> 04:43.005
<i>My friend was on
that last week.</i>

04:43.007 --> 04:43.973
<i>It was really cool.</i>

04:43.975 --> 04:46.176
<i>This guac is delicious,
by the way.</i>

04:46.178 --> 04:47.710
<i>Oh, my gosh, thank you.</i>

04:47.712 --> 04:49.179
<i>Thank you.
I never made it before.</i>

04:49.181 --> 04:51.781
<i>And so I just threw in, like,
some asparagus, and I hope</i>

04:51.783 --> 04:52.616
<i>you don't mind.</i>

04:52.618 --> 04:53.384
<i>That's unique.</i>

04:53.386 --> 04:53.917
<i>It's delicious.</i>

04:53.919 --> 04:54.552
<i>(baby fussing)</i>

04:54.554 --> 04:56.487
<i>I think he's, I think
he's actually happy.</i>

04:56.489 --> 04:57.621
<i>Yeah, don't, don't shake him.</i>

04:57.623 --> 04:59.123
<i>(laughs)</i>

04:59.125 --> 05:00.124
<i>SOFIA: Okay, let's go.</i>

05:00.126 --> 05:00.658
<i>Sleepy time.</i>

05:00.660 --> 05:01.625
<i>Yes, It's time to go.</i>

05:01.627 --> 05:03.661
<i>Why don't you take him? Yeah.</i>

05:03.663 --> 05:04.428
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

05:04.430 --> 05:04.728
<i>No!</i>

05:04.730 --> 05:05.596
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

05:05.598 --> 05:06.931
<i>We were having fun!</i>

05:06.933 --> 05:08.933
<i>You can put him down, Sofia.</i>

05:08.935 --> 05:11.670
<i>Gotta say, guys, good
vibes on the au pair.</i>

05:11.672 --> 05:13.638
<i>Got an A-plus in the
au pair department.</i>

05:13.640 --> 05:14.139
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>

05:14.141 --> 05:15.440
<i>And she's pretty.</i>

05:15.442 --> 05:16.141
<i>Pretty?</i>

05:16.143 --> 05:18.444
<i>I think the word you're
looking for is "plain."</i>

05:18.446 --> 05:20.613
<i>You know, because she has those
big, fat meat earlobes.</i>

05:20.615 --> 05:21.580
<i>Yeah, yeah, the meat lobes.</i>

05:21.582 --> 05:22.148
<i>Yeah, meat lobes.</i>

05:22.150 --> 05:22.915
<i>Really pointy elbows.</i>

05:22.917 --> 05:25.217
<i>Bet you if you checked her out,
you'd find out she's got</i>

05:25.219 --> 05:26.552
<i>a big old retrograde
uterus in there.</i>

05:26.554 --> 05:28.420
<i>You know, my sister has
a retrograde uterus.</i>

05:28.422 --> 05:31.656
<i>I didn't mean...
That's why you can't get a girl.</i>

05:31.658 --> 05:33.891
<i>And then you wonder why
you're dating online.</i>

05:33.893 --> 05:35.793
<i>That's a choice, Sofia.</i>

05:35.795 --> 05:37.861
<i>Really? Retrograde uterus?</i>

05:37.863 --> 05:39.029
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

05:39.031 --> 05:41.397
<i>Just something between
earlobes and uterus.</i>

05:41.399 --> 05:41.931
<i>You took it all!</i>

05:41.933 --> 05:44.001
<i>You leave me out there
like an island.</i>

05:44.003 --> 05:46.536
<i>The only thing I could say was
uterus after elbows over here.</i>

05:46.538 --> 05:48.739
<i>Look, I know what you guys
are trying to pull here.</i>

05:48.741 --> 05:50.674
<i>I think you're laying on
the charm a little thick.</i>

05:50.676 --> 05:50.975
<i>No!</i>

05:50.977 --> 05:51.909
<i>I thought it was subtle.</i>

05:51.911 --> 05:54.012
<i>We're trying to, you know,
help you out a little bit.</i>

05:54.014 --> 05:54.846
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

05:54.848 --> 05:55.981
<i>Let me make this very clear.</i>

05:55.983 --> 05:58.717
<i>Ashley's here to touch baby
Jeffrey's dinger, none of yours.</i>

05:58.719 --> 05:59.885
<i>I'm looking at you, Taco.</i>

05:59.887 --> 06:01.921
<i>I already have two au pairs
touching my dinger.</i>

06:01.923 --> 06:03.556
<i>I don't need a third.</i>

06:03.558 --> 06:04.423
<i>You know what?</i>

06:04.425 --> 06:07.393
<i>As a favor to you, Ruxin, I
am going to power down--</i>

06:07.395 --> 06:08.127
<i>boof-- the charm machine.</i>

06:08.129 --> 06:10.395
<i>Was that the charm machine
that you just shut down?</i>

06:10.397 --> 06:10.729
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:10.731 --> 06:12.564
<i>Why does it have a crank on it?</i>

06:12.566 --> 06:14.499
<i>'Cause, uh, you know,
it's old school.</i>

06:14.501 --> 06:15.533
<i>Is it steam powered?</i>

06:15.535 --> 06:16.334
<i>It's hydraulics.</i>

06:16.336 --> 06:18.135
<i>By the way, guys, don't
touch the guacamole.</i>

06:18.137 --> 06:18.969
<i>Is it gross?</i>

06:18.971 --> 06:20.004
<i>It's nasty.</i>

06:20.006 --> 06:21.004
<i>Oh, it looks disgusting.</i>

06:21.006 --> 06:22.406
<i>Oh, shut up. Shut up.</i>

06:22.408 --> 06:23.140
<i>Here we go.</i>

06:23.142 --> 06:24.575
<i>San Diego's about to score.</i>

06:24.577 --> 06:27.144
<i>My boy, Matthews, give
me those points.</i>

06:27.146 --> 06:29.547
<i>Uh, your boy, Matthews is
sitting on the bench.</i>

06:29.549 --> 06:31.883
<i>Norv Turner just took
him out of the game.</i>

06:31.885 --> 06:33.151
<i>My boy Tolbert coming out.</i>

06:33.153 --> 06:34.152
<i>There we go!</i>

06:34.154 --> 06:35.954
<i>And just fall into the goal.</i>

06:35.956 --> 06:36.655
<i>Yes!</i>

06:36.657 --> 06:38.156
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

06:38.158 --> 06:39.825
<i>That's his third
touchdown of the day.</i>

06:39.827 --> 06:40.826
<i>Three yards? Are you kidding?</i>

06:40.828 --> 06:43.429
<i>The guy is vulturing
all my points.</i>

06:43.431 --> 06:45.164
<i>Vulturing's the way to go, man.</i>

06:45.166 --> 06:46.399
<i>Minimum effort,
maximum results.</i>

06:46.401 --> 06:47.566
<i>(squeals like a vulture)</i>

06:47.568 --> 06:48.834
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

06:48.836 --> 06:51.036
<i>Ryan Matthews is
getting the job done.</i>

06:51.038 --> 06:53.172

12:47.859 --> 12:50.026
<i>Vanessa E...
Andre, nobody cares about</i>

12:50.028 --> 12:52.195
<i>some cat-hoarding loner
you're dealing with.</i>

12:52.197 --> 12:53.463
<i>This is the ultimate hookup.</i>

12:53.465 --> 12:54.631
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

12:54.633 --> 12:55.198
<i>What happened?</i>

12:55.200 --> 12:56.065
<i>I am at a hotel bar.</i>

12:56.067 --> 12:56.733
<i>I see Matthew Berry.</i>

12:56.735 --> 12:57.700
<i>So I get my nerve up.</i>

12:57.702 --> 12:58.768
<i>Did you neg him?</i>

12:58.770 --> 12:59.736
<i>Did I neg him?</i>

12:59.738 --> 13:00.703
<i>It's disrespectful.</i>

13:00.705 --> 13:02.872
<i>No! I made eye contact with him,
I didn't inundate him with</i>

13:02.874 --> 13:04.741
<i>football, I talked about
some other things.</i>

13:04.743 --> 13:06.977
<i>If this was a first date, it would
be the greatest first date</i>

13:06.979 --> 13:07.611
<i>of all time.</i>

13:07.613 --> 13:09.145
<i>Oh, you took him rock climbing?</i>

13:09.147 --> 13:11.448
<i>Why the hell would I
take him rock climbing?</i>

13:11.450 --> 13:13.350
<i>What happened when
Jenny found out?</i>

13:13.352 --> 13:14.719
<i>She must have freaked out.</i>

13:14.721 --> 13:19.925
<i>She... Oh... When she's... she...
Oh, I see what's going on here.</i>

13:19.927 --> 13:21.159
<i>You are cheating
on Jenny, Kevin.</i>

13:21.161 --> 13:23.461
<i>No, I'm not cheating on Jenny.</i>

13:23.463 --> 13:24.395
<i>You didn't tell her.</i>

13:24.397 --> 13:25.997
<i>You're cheating on your
wife with Matthew Berry.</i>

13:25.999 --> 13:27.365
<i>No, no. There's no cheating.</i>

13:27.367 --> 13:28.867
<i>I just got a phone
number, and that's all.</i>

13:28.869 --> 13:29.768
<i>Nothing's gonna happen.</i>

13:29.770 --> 13:31.936
<i>Kevin? This feeling in your
loins right now, this is</i>

13:31.938 --> 13:33.504
<i>emotional cheating, and
this is not acceptable.</i>

13:33.506 --> 13:34.705
<i>Oh, I'm throbbing.</i>

13:34.707 --> 13:35.873
<i>Hey, what I miss?</i>

13:35.875 --> 13:38.375
<i>I got Matthew Berry's
phone number.</i>

13:38.377 --> 13:39.543
<i>What the tits?</i>

13:43.064 --> 13:44.534
Ruxin, big news.

13:44.654 --> 13:46.521
I have a date with
Matthew Berry.

13:46.523 --> 13:49.056
We were trading emails back and
forth, and we're going to

13:49.058 --> 13:50.158
get together for some drinks.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.492
Can you believe this?

13:51.494 --> 13:52.827
Why are you here?

13:52.829 --> 13:56.097
'Cause I don't really want to tell
Jenny about my date with Matthew.

13:56.099 --> 13:56.831
So lie to her.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.700
No way. She...
She'll read me like a book.

13:58.702 --> 13:59.600
She knows.

13:59.602 --> 14:00.401
So?

14:00.403 --> 14:03.471
So I need you to teach
me how to be a liar.

14:03.473 --> 14:04.973
You don't need to whisper.

14:04.975 --> 14:06.107
We're at a law firm.

14:06.109 --> 14:07.775
Lying is encouraged here.

14:07.777 --> 14:09.610
Look, I am not
your guy for this.

14:09.612 --> 14:11.578
You need a low-level
maintenance liar like Pete.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.713
No, I have never
been married before.

14:13.715 --> 14:16.482
Yeah, I definitely
own my own home.

14:16.484 --> 14:17.916
No. This isn't a cold sore.

14:17.918 --> 14:22.120
I'm the guy who you come to when you're
ready to perjure yourself to protect an

14:22.122 --> 14:23.488
Australian mining consortium.

14:23.490 --> 14:26.458
Ruxin, you are the best
worst person I know.

14:26.460 --> 14:27.125
Thank you.

14:27.127 --> 14:32.330
I am very flattered and insulted by that.
So... All right.

14:32.332 --> 14:34.333
I have to run some
errands this afternoon.

14:34.335 --> 14:35.534
Don't hit my desk, okay?

14:35.536 --> 14:37.870
This came over on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

14:37.872 --> 14:40.506
<i>Really? Oh, you're good.</i>

14:40.508 --> 14:41.674
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

14:41.676 --> 14:44.677
<i>Did I get this chocolate stain on there?
Absolutely not.</i>

14:44.679 --> 14:46.146
<i>I don't even eat chocolate.</i>

14:46.148 --> 14:47.981
<i>So you're going to fix
it for me for free?</i>

14:47.983 --> 14:52.452
<i>Maybe starch the collar, too.</i>

14:52.454 --> 14:54.687
<i>I don't know why I haven't
been losing any weight.</i>

14:54.689 --> 14:57.090
<i>I've been exercising,
staying away from the bar.</i>

14:57.092 --> 14:59.792
<i>I haven't eaten chocolate
in, like, a month.</i>

14:59.794 --> 15:02.094
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We can't replace this for you.</i>

15:02.096 --> 15:03.596
<i>These are little bite marks.</i>

15:03.598 --> 15:05.831
<i>I mean, maybe your son was
chewing on the phone.</i>

15:05.833 --> 15:07.699
<i>I don't have a son.</i>

15:07.701 --> 15:10.402
<i>If you must know, I
work at an orphanage.</i>

15:10.404 --> 15:12.671
<i>This child's parents vanished two
years ago in a parasailing</i>

15:12.673 --> 15:13.104
<i>accident.</i>

15:13.106 --> 15:15.708
<i>I can bring him in here, and
you can tell him about the</i>

15:15.710 --> 15:18.511
<i>crushing loneliness that he's going
to feel not having a parent.</i>

15:18.513 --> 15:24.518
<i>Uh, no. I... I can...
I'll get you another one right away.</i>

15:24.520 --> 15:26.453
<i>God, that was exhausting.</i>

15:26.455 --> 15:27.855
<i>You never told the truth once.</i>

15:27.857 --> 15:29.323
<i>I don't how you do it.</i>

15:29.325 --> 15:31.658
<i>When you're faced with your own
deception, you need to buy</i>

15:31.660 --> 15:32.692
<i>yourself some time.</i>

15:32.694 --> 15:34.494
<i>Were you just looking
at that waitress?</i>

15:34.496 --> 15:35.361
<i>What?</i>

15:35.363 --> 15:36.529
<i>What? Uh... You look away.</i>

15:36.531 --> 15:37.663
<i>What? No.</i>

15:37.665 --> 15:38.931
<i>You immediately seem guilty.</i>

15:38.933 --> 15:41.667
<i>You need to look that person dead
in the eyes and repeat the</i>

15:41.669 --> 15:42.468
<i>question.</i>

15:42.470 --> 15:45.137
<i>Did I just look at that waitress?
Absolutely not.</i>

15:45.139 --> 15:46.538
<i>Then you flip it on them.</i>

15:46.540 --> 15:49.641
<i>But what does that say about you?
What's going on with you today?</i>

15:49.643 --> 15:51.877
<i>It hasn't been the easiest day,
I mean, Ellie's got a...</i>

15:51.879 --> 15:53.511
<i>Oh, you just did it.</i>

15:53.513 --> 15:54.879
<i>You... you flipped it around.</i>

15:54.881 --> 15:58.817
<i>I didn't...
Think of tonight as a dress</i>

15:58.819 --> 16:00.386
<i>rehearsal for the perfect date.</i>

16:00.388 --> 16:03.089
<i>Yeah, yeah.
But what is this date for exactly?</i>

16:03.091 --> 16:06.893
<i>To impress her, so she'll eventually,
you know, have sex with me.</i>

16:06.895 --> 16:08.862
<i>Why don't you just have sex
with her when you meet her?</i>

16:08.864 --> 16:10.863
<i>You can't just have sex with
a girl when you meet her.</i>

16:10.865 --> 16:12.331
<i>It's like a three-step process.</i>

16:12.333 --> 16:14.700
<i>I'm picking them up.
I'm taking them out to a nice dinner.</i>

16:14.702 --> 16:17.402
<i>We're going to go see some
hot jazz or, you know...</i>

16:17.404 --> 16:19.171
<i>Oh, yeah. Then you have sex with
her there so you don't have</i>

16:19.173 --> 16:21.173
<i>to go back to her place
and have sex...</i>

16:21.175 --> 16:23.109
<i>No. I'm not going to have sex
with her at the jazz place.</i>

16:23.111 --> 16:25.545
<i>Why? The jazz place
doesn't have a bathroom?</i>

16:25.547 --> 16:26.713
<i>No. It has a bathroom.</i>

16:26.715 --> 16:28.881
<i>Uh, look, just engage...
I can't tell where my</i>

16:28.883 --> 16:30.849
<i>conversation skills are if you're
not engaging with me, all</i>

16:30.851 --> 16:31.316
<i>right?</i>

16:31.318 --> 16:32.317
<i>I... I understand that.</i>

16:32.319 --> 16:34.119
<i>But why aren't you
inside of me right now?</i>

16:34.121 --> 16:36.588
<i>I'm not going to be inside...
Whoa. Hi.</i>

16:36.590 --> 16:37.723
<i>I don't mean to interrupt.</i>

16:37.725 --> 16:38.990
<i>But are you guys ready to order?</i>

16:38.992 --> 16:40.725
<i>Actually, that is a
great question.</i>

16:40.727 --> 16:42.861
<i>That's the number one question
I have tonight, which</i>

16:42.863 --> 16:44.362
<i>is wine. Is that too stuffy?</i>

16:44.364 --> 16:45.629
<i>I have a whole wine list.</i>

16:45.631 --> 16:46.396
<i>Okay.</i>

16:46.398 --> 16:48.666
<i>Why don't you just order
what Pete ordered?</i>

16:48.668 --> 16:49.533
<i>He's doing fine.</i>

16:49.535 --> 16:53.504
<i>Pete... He vultured my date.</i>

16:53.506 --> 16:55.272
<i>He vultured my date.</i>

16:55.274 --> 16:56.474
<i>Go get it, Pete.</i>

16:56.476 --> 16:57.675
<i>Who's Pete?</i>

16:57.677 --> 17:00.578
<i>He's a friend of ours who's going
to have sex with Andre's date.</i>

17:00.580 --> 17:02.313
<i>What do you think
about skydiving?</i>

17:02.315 --> 17:04.415
<i>Hi. Vanessa E. Remember me?</i>

17:04.416 --> 17:05.583
<i>No.</i>

17:05.585 --> 17:07.385
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

17:07.387 --> 17:10.622
<i>Well, interestingly enough,
Vanessa and I have a shared</i>

17:10.624 --> 17:11.589
<i>interest in rock climbing.</i>

17:11.592 --> 17:12.589
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:12.592 --> 17:13.558
<i>But you need to be careful.</i>

17:13.560 --> 17:14.291
<i>You almost fell.</i>

17:14.294 --> 17:15.527
<i>Well, you saved me.</i>

17:15.529 --> 17:16.728
<i>Rock climbing.</i>

17:16.730 --> 17:18.896
<i>Wow, what a great
first date idea.</i>

17:18.898 --> 17:21.165
<i>Where'd you get that, you vulture?
You come in right when</i>

17:21.167 --> 17:23.968
<i>I'm about to score on the one-yard
line, you vulture my date.</i>

17:23.970 --> 17:26.371
<i>You're the Mike
Tolbert of my life.</i>

17:26.373 --> 17:27.505
<i>I will call you, Vanessa E.</i>

17:27.507 --> 17:28.807
<i>Well... Yeah, not tonight.</i>

17:28.809 --> 17:32.611
<i>Going to be a little late, so...
</i>

17:32.613 --> 17:33.979
<i>Taco, we're going!</i>

17:33.981 --> 17:34.679
<i>No, no.</i>

17:34.681 --> 17:37.882
<i>I'm going to stick around and
date Nikki in the bathroom.</i>

17:37.884 --> 17:41.586
<i>Why, yes, Matthew Berry, I can
meet you whenever you like.</i>

17:41.588 --> 17:42.353
<i>(screams)</i>

17:42.355 --> 17:44.589
<i>Hey.</i>

17:44.591 --> 17:45.356
<i>Hey.</i>

17:45.358 --> 17:45.957
<i>Hi.</i>

17:45.959 --> 17:47.526
<i>You pulled in, like,
ten minutes ago.</i>

17:47.528 --> 17:48.126
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:48.128 --> 17:49.695
<i>Have you been on the
phone this whole time?</i>

17:49.697 --> 17:55.500
<i>Wha... Um... Have I been on
the phone the whole time?</i>

17:55.502 --> 17:56.601
<i>Absolutely.</i>

17:56.603 --> 17:58.069
<i>With my work.</i>

17:58.071 --> 18:01.472
<i>It's just an important case, but,
you know, enough about me.</i>

18:01.474 --> 18:02.073
<i>Hmm.</i>

18:02.075 --> 18:03.641
<i>How was your day at work today?</i>

18:03.643 --> 18:04.709
<i>You know what?</i>

18:04.711 --> 18:06.344
<i>It was kind of miserable.</i>

18:06.346 --> 18:06.911
<i>Oh.</i>

18:06.913 --> 18:09.013
<i>I have these new clients, and they
just have no idea what they</i>

18:09.015 --> 18:09.647
<i>want.</i>

18:09.649 --> 18:12.318
<i>So we saw, like, 20 houses, and
they were all awful, you know.</i>

18:12.438 --> 18:15.103
<i>Thank you, Rux... Ruxin.</i>

18:19.559 --> 18:20.459
Hello?

18:20.461 --> 18:22.150
Dr.
Andre Nowzik for two, please.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.630
And, uh, McArthur, table
for two, I believe.

18:24.632 --> 18:25.498
What the hell?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.065
Hello.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.667
How did you know
about this place?

18:27.669 --> 18:28.402
Pete told me.

18:28.404 --> 18:28.935
Pete.

18:28.937 --> 18:30.270
He's been bogarting everything.

18:30.272 --> 18:32.472
Look, that date in there, I
want it to go really well.

18:32.474 --> 18:33.573
So do not interfere.

18:33.575 --> 18:35.775
Andre, I'm not going to
interfere as long as you don't

18:35.777 --> 18:37.310
bogart my date with
Matthew Berry.

18:37.312 --> 18:37.810
Fine.

18:37.812 --> 18:41.714
Fine.

18:41.716 --> 18:42.548
(sighs)

18:42.550 --> 18:43.716
Matthew Berry.

18:43.718 --> 18:45.350
With Melanie B.

18:45.352 --> 18:47.286
He's vulturing my date.

18:47.288 --> 18:48.020
Not again.

18:48.022 --> 18:49.354
Andre, please be cool.

18:49.356 --> 18:51.223
For the first-- Oh, my God.

18:51.225 --> 18:53.825
Seriously, before I got married,
like, dating was such a nightmare.

18:53.827 --> 18:56.362
Listen, I know a number of single guys...
What the hell?!

18:56.364 --> 18:58.431
Matthew Berry, you're
vulturing my date.

18:58.433 --> 19:00.033
I'm not vulturing
your date, dude.

19:00.035 --> 19:02.336
Oh, I know what vulturing looks
like, and you're vulturing.

19:02.338 --> 19:03.036
Excuse me for a second.

19:03.038 --> 19:03.670
Sure.

19:03.672 --> 19:05.773
Listen, normally, I do fantasy
advice, but let me give

19:05.775 --> 19:06.874
you some life advice here.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.743
How many dates have you
been on with this woman?

19:08.745 --> 19:09.610
Like, I don't know.

19:09.612 --> 19:10.511
Two, two and a half.

19:10.513 --> 19:13.781
Okay, when she's asking me to set
her up with guys before your

19:13.783 --> 19:15.549
third date, that's a bad sign.

19:15.551 --> 19:18.452
She's just being, you know,
cautiously optimistic.

19:18.454 --> 19:19.920
We have different
definitions of that word.

19:19.922 --> 19:21.522
Are you pulling
me from the game?

19:21.524 --> 19:22.923
Are you pulling
me from the game?

19:22.925 --> 19:23.624
No, no, listen.

19:23.626 --> 19:24.324
You got your shot.

19:24.326 --> 19:25.726
You got first down,
you got second down.

19:25.728 --> 19:27.494
You really think you're getting
it done on third down?

19:27.496 --> 19:28.328
I'll get it done.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.329
I could punch it in, right?

19:29.331 --> 19:30.330
See, you're creeping her out.

19:30.332 --> 19:30.897
This is the problem.

19:30.899 --> 19:31.865
I'm not creeping her out.

19:31.867 --> 19:32.799
I'm just-- I'm trying.

19:32.801 --> 19:33.766
Come on, give me the ball.

19:33.768 --> 19:34.867
Listen, it's okay, it's okay.

19:34.869 --> 19:35.668
I'm on Twitter.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.604
Listen, a lot of guys move the
chains, and then someone

19:37.606 --> 19:39.072
else comes in and
scores a touchdown.

19:39.074 --> 19:39.706
That's okay.

19:39.708 --> 19:40.507
We need chain movers.

19:40.509 --> 19:42.677
This woman has been set
up for another guy.

19:42.679 --> 19:43.578
That's awesome by you.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.379
I'm the guy!

19:44.381 --> 19:45.080
Let me be the guy.

19:45.082 --> 19:45.914
Come on, let me score.

19:45.916 --> 19:47.782
Okay, now you're creeping
everyone else out in the bar.

19:47.784 --> 19:49.451
I'm not creeping
everybody else out.

19:49.453 --> 19:50.785
Everyone knows that I can score.

19:50.787 --> 19:52.488
You don't seem...
Oh, really? I don't?

19:52.490 --> 19:53.355
I'll convert right now.

19:53.357 --> 19:54.423
I'll convert right now on you.

19:54.425 --> 19:55.390
You want me to convert on you?

19:55.392 --> 19:56.891
Listen, there's no reason
to talk like that.

19:56.893 --> 19:57.893
Oh, really? Here.

19:57.895 --> 20:00.095
Let's let's not
talk, let's fight.

20:00.097 --> 20:02.097
(groaning)

20:02.099 --> 20:02.798
Ow!

20:02.800 --> 20:03.632
All right, listen.

20:03.634 --> 20:05.934
Work on the dating, then
work on the punching.

20:05.936 --> 20:08.302
You will be dating a Chicago
Bear by the end of the week.

20:08.304 --> 20:08.803
Excuse me.

20:08.805 --> 20:09.503
Bye, Matt.

20:09.505 --> 20:10.605
No, no, Matthew, come back!

20:10.607 --> 20:11.539
Come back!

20:11.541 --> 20:14.676
Maybe we can go away
for the weekend!

20:17.979 --> 20:18.612
Oh, hey.

20:18.614 --> 20:19.447
What are you doing up?

20:19.449 --> 20:21.348
What the hell you
doing in my house?

20:21.350 --> 20:22.483
Just making a little tea.

20:22.485 --> 20:23.117
For me?

20:23.119 --> 20:25.386
No.

20:25.388 --> 20:27.888
(groans)

20:27.890 --> 20:29.590
Did you vulture my au pair?

20:29.592 --> 20:31.859
Did I vulture your au pair?

20:31.861 --> 20:33.662
Absolutely not.

20:33.664 --> 20:35.897
I vultured baby
Jeffrey's au pair.

20:35.899 --> 20:37.966
Good night.

20:40.535 --> 20:43.137
Eye contact?

20:43.139 --> 20:44.672
And a half chub?

20:44.674 --> 20:45.430
Ugh.

20:46.831 --> 20:57.189
