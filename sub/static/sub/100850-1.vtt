01:13.289 --> 01:15.691
- Billy?
- Over here!

01:16.992 --> 01:18.936
Billy?

01:18.960 --> 01:20.863
- Is that you?
- Shh, did you hear that?

01:29.371 --> 01:31.274
My God!

01:32.340 --> 01:34.443
No, it can't be.

01:35.177 --> 01:36.410
Shit. Fire. Fire!

01:39.447 --> 01:41.314
Now, fire everything!

02:01.504 --> 02:02.603
Kill it!

02:05.573 --> 02:06.775
Run!

02:26.361 --> 02:28.730
Come get some!

04:50.505 --> 04:54.042
Two more people gone already...
just yesterday.

04:55.711 --> 04:57.855
I thought I had this thing
under wraps

04:57.879 --> 05:00.858
after sweeping our little
problem off the streets.

05:00.882 --> 05:03.052
Seems like it's going from bad
to worse out there.

05:04.319 --> 05:06.464
They've gone
from here to here...

05:06.488 --> 05:08.266
to who in the hell knows where.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.836
That's why you should
always hire the best.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.870
Yeah, I'm learning
that the hard way.

05:12.894 --> 05:14.096
Boldly.

05:14.562 --> 05:15.732
Boldly?

05:15.898 --> 05:17.641
Bold Eagles.

05:17.665 --> 05:22.105
Local militia just disappeared
like everybody else.

05:22.904 --> 05:24.373
A whole militia?

05:26.574 --> 05:30.288
Intel says these vagrants
are well armed

05:30.312 --> 05:32.223
and extremely dangerous.

05:32.247 --> 05:36.451
It will be dealt with, Eddy,
if you have that 20% up front.

05:42.658 --> 05:44.460
I knew I could count on you.

05:48.764 --> 05:50.908
Your men aren't afraid
of monsters, are they?

05:50.932 --> 05:52.911
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:52.935 --> 05:55.680
Just some local legends
about what really lives

05:55.704 --> 05:59.151
out in the forest...
could be scary.

05:59.175 --> 06:01.185
My men don't believe in scary.

06:01.209 --> 06:02.844
My man.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.906
Intel suggests
those vagrants may have migrated

06:54.930 --> 06:56.641
either north or east.

06:56.665 --> 06:58.343
Since when did towns call us in

06:58.367 --> 06:59.768
to defend them
from their homeless?

07:00.903 --> 07:02.703
I think there's a little more
to it than that.

07:04.273 --> 07:06.651
There's always
something more, Artie.

07:06.675 --> 07:09.011
A couple of co-eds were
last seen hiking along this...

07:11.879 --> 07:14.216
Hey! You present, Green?

07:15.783 --> 07:17.428
You want to tell me exactly
what the mayor meant

07:17.452 --> 07:18.963
by monsters?

07:18.987 --> 07:20.798
It's local folklore.

07:20.822 --> 07:23.300
Scary stories the kids tell
round the campfire.

07:23.324 --> 07:24.802
You're not telling me
you're starting to believe

07:24.826 --> 07:26.637
in monsters, are you there,
Julius?

07:26.661 --> 07:28.773
I believe in getting
all available intel

07:28.797 --> 07:30.608
prior to taking on a mission.

07:30.632 --> 07:31.833
That's what I believe in.

07:32.033 --> 07:33.535
OK.

07:34.502 --> 07:35.747
Hey, Perce.

07:35.771 --> 07:37.382
Wanna turn that shit down?

07:37.406 --> 07:38.886
I gotta concentrate
for a moment here.

07:46.615 --> 07:47.692
Hey, Artie.

07:47.716 --> 07:49.150
I'm busy.

07:51.620 --> 07:53.298
Oh, you readin' huh?

07:53.322 --> 07:55.057
There's some great
articles in here.

08:00.329 --> 08:02.007
OK, what?

08:02.031 --> 08:03.540
Who's the knucklehead in front?

08:03.564 --> 08:06.377
It's Lance Hollis. Explosives.

08:06.401 --> 08:08.879
Served a tour under me
in Afghanistan.

08:08.903 --> 08:10.973
Relax, he's good.

08:21.550 --> 08:23.653
I'm good. I'm good, man.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.187
I'm not sick.

08:26.788 --> 08:27.923
A little hungover.

08:30.826 --> 08:32.370
OK, look.

08:32.394 --> 08:34.697
We're in, we're out, we're paid.

08:35.029 --> 08:36.232
No time.

08:36.698 --> 08:38.166
It's a cakewalk.

08:38.433 --> 08:39.844
I don't like cake.

08:39.868 --> 08:41.703
Who the hell doesn't
like cake, Julius?

09:15.604 --> 09:17.448
Alright, boys,
what are we looking at?

09:17.472 --> 09:19.683
This is as far as
the vehicles go.

09:19.707 --> 09:21.376
Need to hoof it from here, sir.

09:21.943 --> 09:24.045
Kayman, you good to go?

09:24.580 --> 09:25.948
Tracking, sir.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.937
Green, look like you just
lost weight.

09:38.961 --> 09:40.393
Yeah, and you found it.

09:45.134 --> 09:46.401
Gents.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.970
Lance Hollis.

09:49.605 --> 09:51.482
Cover your mouth, grunt.

09:51.506 --> 09:53.717
Somebody's got bad breath
they need to sleep off.

09:53.741 --> 09:54.818
I dunno if sleep's gonna work.

09:54.842 --> 09:56.842
This is the first I've seen him
with his eyes open.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.982
Need to drain it,
now's the time.

10:16.565 --> 10:17.775
You know...

10:17.799 --> 10:21.670
Hector Kayman there is the best
sniper that I've ever seen.

10:23.004 --> 10:25.149
Bobby Tristan...

10:25.173 --> 10:27.951
is a weapons expert so good,
he can sniff the air

10:27.975 --> 10:30.154
and let you know
what ammo was used.

10:30.178 --> 10:31.847
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:32.014 --> 10:34.125
And Percy.

10:34.149 --> 10:36.427
Percy's here because he owns
that beautiful machine

10:36.451 --> 10:37.987
that brought
your ass here today.

10:39.086 --> 10:41.189
And clearly you can look at me
and see why I'm here.

10:41.722 --> 10:43.467
Yeah.

10:43.491 --> 10:45.360
- Speaking of beautiful machines.
- Exactly.

10:46.227 --> 10:47.762
But why you here, Hollis?

10:48.563 --> 10:51.199
Well, probably here cos of this.

10:53.134 --> 10:54.936
I hear you got
some explosives in there?

10:56.772 --> 10:58.140
I got all the explosives
in there.

11:02.644 --> 11:05.714
That booze I'm smelling
better not be fresh.

12:24.725 --> 12:25.769
Got something.

12:25.793 --> 12:27.162
One o'clock.

13:35.797 --> 13:37.600
I got human remains here, over.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.778
Copy.

13:40.802 --> 13:42.938
Everyone move
to Green's location, over.

13:59.988 --> 14:01.624
The hell's out there?

14:28.450 --> 14:30.986
Think our vagrants
are cannibals?

14:31.419 --> 14:33.122
Not human.

14:35.423 --> 14:37.292
Has to be some kind of animal.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.070
Some big-ass animal.

14:39.094 --> 14:41.196
And it took some big-ass bites.

14:41.395 --> 14:42.530
Ya alright?

14:44.131 --> 14:45.809
Could be a mountain lion.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.011
Maybe a black bear.

14:48.035 --> 14:50.770
A black bear left a head
in the cooler?

14:52.274 --> 14:54.977
That would have to be
the biggest black bear.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.146
So?

14:58.813 --> 15:00.214
This way.

15:05.854 --> 15:07.523
You puke it all out, son?

15:11.225 --> 15:13.328
- Hope so.
- Yeah, me too.

15:15.129 --> 15:16.464
Move out.

16:10.485 --> 16:11.520
Don't move.

16:14.456 --> 16:17.335
- What, are you gonna shoot me?
- Sir, are you aware

16:17.359 --> 16:19.504
that the park
and all the surrounding area

16:19.528 --> 16:22.038
is currently closed
to the public?

16:22.062 --> 16:24.165
We need to get out of here
right now.

16:29.437 --> 16:33.518
Gwen... is that fracking?

16:33.542 --> 16:35.444
No, that's on the other side
of the mountain.

16:37.345 --> 16:38.614
Wait!

16:40.347 --> 16:42.092
Dammit.

16:42.116 --> 16:43.427
Where are you going?

16:43.451 --> 16:44.928
Gwen!

16:44.952 --> 16:47.321
You see he has a rifle,
don't you?

17:26.492 --> 17:27.938
Ooh-wee!

17:27.962 --> 17:29.430
Anybody else catching
that stink?

17:55.123 --> 17:56.558
Ugh, the smell.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.978
These idiots lose control
of their campfire?

18:08.002 --> 18:09.470
Maybe they have flamethrowers.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.367
What are you thinking?

18:39.366 --> 18:41.245
Thinking about local folklore

18:41.269 --> 18:43.472
scary stories kids telling
around the campfire

18:44.172 --> 18:45.349
before they burn down the forest

18:45.373 --> 18:47.476
and start taking huge bites
out of people.

18:51.512 --> 18:52.780
So you think you can track 'em?

18:54.516 --> 18:55.918
Who you talking to?

18:58.019 --> 19:00.363
Listen up! Diamond formation.

19:00.387 --> 19:02.132
Five metre spread.

19:02.156 --> 19:03.559
Keep each other in sight.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.496
Area could be trapped or mined.

19:09.463 --> 19:10.598
Move out!

19:41.628 --> 19:42.863
Ryan!

19:47.669 --> 19:49.605
Don't move.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.776
Weapon.

19:56.510 --> 19:57.945
Jesus Christ.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.748
Weapon.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.021
Come on.

20:06.253 --> 20:07.488
Now.

20:16.431 --> 20:17.699
Hands up.

20:20.268 --> 20:21.470
Move.

20:22.103 --> 20:24.272
- Where?
- Back there.

20:25.105 --> 20:26.274
I can't go back there.

20:27.307 --> 20:28.644
Move.

20:29.477 --> 20:30.979
You don't want to do this, lady.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.282
You are absolutely right.

20:41.655 --> 20:43.333
What are you so scared of?

20:43.357 --> 20:45.235
Bringing this big gun out here.

20:45.259 --> 20:48.429
I'm telling you, lady,
we need to get gone.

20:55.403 --> 20:56.538
Stay right there.

21:09.150 --> 21:10.318
Ryan?

21:14.088 --> 21:15.723
I'm sorry.

21:16.090 --> 21:17.091
He's gone.

21:21.695 --> 21:23.030
- What's your name?
- Griffin.

21:23.664 --> 21:25.775
Well, Griffin, I don't believe

21:25.799 --> 21:27.544
I told you to lower your arms.

21:27.568 --> 21:28.712
Look, lady,
I'm not gonna hurt you

21:28.736 --> 21:30.380
any way, shape or form.

21:30.404 --> 21:31.772
I just wanna get out of here.

21:32.673 --> 21:34.408
So let's go.

21:36.577 --> 21:38.780
- Go where?
- We're gonna go find him.

21:39.713 --> 21:41.191
Do you not see that blood?

21:41.215 --> 21:42.693
We can't be sure
that's his blood.

21:42.717 --> 21:44.553
We don't know who it belongs to.

21:46.554 --> 21:47.789
Look, lady.

21:49.324 --> 21:50.400
It's Gwen

21:50.424 --> 21:52.870
and we're gonna find out
what's going on out here.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.495
Can I have my gun back, Gwen?

22:01.736 --> 22:03.605
Do you actually know
how to fire that thing?

22:04.439 --> 22:06.875
Yes. I fire it all the time.

22:11.578 --> 22:13.013
Let's go.

22:20.688 --> 22:21.957
What you got?

22:22.490 --> 22:23.825
Trail's dead.

22:24.491 --> 22:26.127
Just fly off into the air?

22:26.560 --> 22:27.928
Actually...

22:29.163 --> 22:30.808
Yeah.

22:30.832 --> 22:32.408
Don't beat yourself up there,
Julius.

22:32.432 --> 22:33.868
You did your best.

22:34.434 --> 22:35.837
You haven't seen my best.

22:37.805 --> 22:39.508
Pick that trail back up.

24:06.294 --> 24:07.662
Kayman, come in.

24:08.796 --> 24:10.674
<i>I read you, over.</i>

24:10.698 --> 24:13.001
Got eyes on anything
in the trees? Over.

24:14.836 --> 24:16.905
Negative. All clear up high...

24:17.372 --> 24:18.607
over.

24:35.722 --> 24:37.192
Wait, do you hear that?

24:40.627 --> 24:42.773
Hey, get...

24:42.797 --> 24:44.098
get down.

25:04.585 --> 25:05.795
Right, homos! You all just...

25:05.819 --> 25:07.187
No!

25:23.738 --> 25:25.298
I think I got something
over here, guys.

25:25.839 --> 25:27.575
Percy, what you got? Over.

25:31.045 --> 25:32.411
You guys hearing this?

25:34.715 --> 25:36.117
Percy.

25:47.627 --> 25:49.106
Everyone, Percy's position now!

25:49.130 --> 25:51.341
Percy? Percy!

25:51.365 --> 25:53.043
Kayman, what you got? Over.

25:53.067 --> 25:55.770
I ain't seeing shit, sir. Over.

26:21.962 --> 26:24.507
Green, come in.
Anyone else firing? Over.

26:24.531 --> 26:27.267
Heard it too. I'm headed to
Percy's location, over.

26:48.055 --> 26:49.156
Where's Percy?

26:50.657 --> 26:51.859
Unknown.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.133
<i>Any sign of Percy? Over.</i>

27:01.736 --> 27:03.781
<i>Hold position
and keep looking, Kayman.</i>

27:03.805 --> 27:06.708
- <i>Over.</i>
- Copy, over.

27:11.479 --> 27:12.946
Starting to believe
in monsters, sir?

27:16.483 --> 27:17.984
Green, report back. Over.

27:21.756 --> 27:23.324
I know this sounds strange,
but...

27:23.990 --> 27:25.793
the trail just goes dead. Over.

27:27.662 --> 27:29.172
Copy.

27:29.196 --> 27:31.732
Kayman, eyes on anything? Over.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.038
Still negatory up here, over.

27:50.626 --> 27:52.020
Same thing as before.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.465
Trail just vanishes here.

27:54.489 --> 27:56.758
Looks like a couple
of fracking rhinos fell here.

28:21.648 --> 28:23.560
Can you feel the wind?

28:23.584 --> 28:25.529
The wind is lifting the fog

28:25.553 --> 28:26.996
and blowing away the clouds

28:27.020 --> 28:28.223
which cover the moon!

28:29.990 --> 28:32.802
And he will command the beast
and all of you

28:32.826 --> 28:35.104
all of you! You will die.

28:35.128 --> 28:36.907
All of you will die.

28:36.931 --> 28:38.074
Help me.

28:38.098 --> 28:39.909
You're gonna die too.

28:39.933 --> 28:42.369
You, all of you are gonna die.

28:44.605 --> 28:47.918
Now he's back at last
and he will command the beast.

28:47.942 --> 28:49.151
And all of you!

28:49.175 --> 28:51.912
All of you will die.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.955
Breathe in the smoke of life.

29:02.589 --> 29:04.024
Breathe it in!

29:04.724 --> 29:06.035
I know you think Percy is...

29:06.059 --> 29:08.195
I never think anything, Hollis.

29:11.031 --> 29:12.543
What you got, Green?

29:12.567 --> 29:14.034
I mighta saw something.

29:14.067 --> 29:15.403
Details.

29:16.037 --> 29:17.271
I don't know, but...

29:17.738 --> 29:19.107
it sounded really big.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.686
Well, which is it?
You see it or you hear it?

29:22.710 --> 29:26.146
Heard. Felt like it was coming
from the tops of the trees.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.185
What now?

29:32.286 --> 29:34.097
Men...

29:34.121 --> 29:35.831
we have to accept the
possibility

29:35.855 --> 29:37.858
that we may have seen
the last of Percy Robertson.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.495
Green.

29:43.798 --> 29:47.010
We don't have a trail, but...

29:47.034 --> 29:48.978
my instincts are telling me
that our enemy is

29:49.002 --> 29:51.081
retreating deeper
into the forest

29:51.105 --> 29:52.906
as opposed to looking
for a way out.

31:22.395 --> 31:23.530
Clear.

31:26.933 --> 31:28.069
These our guys?

31:30.104 --> 31:31.313
Former military.

31:31.337 --> 31:32.948
They stink.

31:32.972 --> 31:34.784
They're vagrants, Tristan.

31:34.808 --> 31:36.243
Yeah, but do you smell that?

31:36.911 --> 31:38.722
Same as when I found Percy.

31:38.746 --> 31:41.149
Don't move!

31:43.951 --> 31:45.286
Don't shoot.

31:45.786 --> 31:46.988
Who the hell are you?

31:47.821 --> 31:49.289
- Griffin.
- You alone?

31:49.856 --> 31:51.224
Yeah.

31:52.859 --> 31:54.236
Where the hell
are my goddamn pants?

31:54.260 --> 31:56.773
Mr Griffin,
what are you doing out here?

31:56.797 --> 31:58.274
- Whoa!
- Slow.

31:58.298 --> 31:59.466
Damn, dude.

32:03.203 --> 32:05.072
Y'all after those dirty hobos
too, man?

32:06.906 --> 32:08.306
What do you know
about the vagrants?

32:08.409 --> 32:09.886
What's a vagrant?

32:09.910 --> 32:11.346
What do you know
about these men?

32:12.512 --> 32:14.491
They've got a lady
park ranger hostage.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.193
Do not bullshit us.

32:16.217 --> 32:17.893
Man, I was with her.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.196
They got the jump on us.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.687
She ain't here now.

32:21.154 --> 32:22.431
Agh!

32:22.455 --> 32:24.333
Probably here right now...

32:24.357 --> 32:25.802
But we can follow
the river down this way.

32:25.826 --> 32:27.838
Agh! Not down there, man.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.030
- Come again?
- I've been out here for...

32:31.030 --> 32:32.367
for a while.

32:33.834 --> 32:37.813
Over that mountain,
there's caves, ravines.

32:37.837 --> 32:39.607
That's where I'd be
if I were a "vagrunt".

32:44.244 --> 32:45.712
Lead the way, Mr Griffin.

32:47.248 --> 32:48.549
Can I have my gun?

32:53.019 --> 32:54.499
Can I at least put
my clothes back on?

32:55.522 --> 32:57.466
- You have one minute.
- One minute...

32:57.490 --> 32:59.034
Are you serious?

32:59.058 --> 33:00.494
Is he serious?

33:01.528 --> 33:03.431
Oh, man!

33:08.803 --> 33:10.138
Give me back my shit.

33:13.874 --> 33:15.209
Picking up dead weight.

33:16.109 --> 33:17.577
Maybe we could use him
as a decoy.

33:20.314 --> 33:21.682
Minute's up. Move it.

33:22.348 --> 33:23.348
Bums!

33:24.818 --> 33:26.154
Let's go, "high speed".

33:30.490 --> 33:31.792
Come on, man.

34:17.538 --> 34:19.949
Bring out the next sacrifice!

34:19.974 --> 34:22.117
So you think I'm lying to you?

34:22.141 --> 34:26.188
You'll soon see,
yeah, you'll soon see.

34:26.213 --> 34:29.123
I want to sacrifice a skull
for a bull.

34:29.148 --> 34:30.350
What do you want?

34:34.021 --> 34:36.130
Kick us out of town!

34:36.155 --> 34:38.592
We don't need you.

34:38.626 --> 34:40.135
What the hell?

34:40.159 --> 34:42.472
If it bleeds, we can kill it!

34:42.496 --> 34:44.531
Some kind of religious ritual
or something.

34:45.297 --> 34:47.342
They're goddamn freaks, man.

34:47.367 --> 34:48.344
And soon...

34:48.369 --> 34:50.471
soon, the hunt will begin.

34:51.371 --> 34:52.505
Alright, boys.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.516
It'll be thunder formation.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.243
- Kayman, eyes.
- Copy.

34:57.210 --> 34:58.745
You stay here.

34:59.146 --> 35:01.323
Unarmed?

35:01.347 --> 35:04.260
Sacrifice,
and we will command the beast

35:04.284 --> 35:05.961
and all of you, all of you...

35:05.985 --> 35:07.320
Alright, move out.

35:12.126 --> 35:13.570
Keep low.

35:13.594 --> 35:14.928
Whatever, bro.

35:29.643 --> 35:30.810
Are you ready?

35:31.612 --> 35:32.713
Always.

35:35.048 --> 35:36.184
Move out.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.426
What's your 20, Kayman? Over.

35:55.402 --> 35:56.937
In position, over.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.283
Damn!

37:19.719 --> 37:21.421
Have a knife day.

37:26.092 --> 37:28.271
All of you are going to die!

37:28.295 --> 37:30.340
You think I'm lying?

37:30.364 --> 37:33.809
And soon,
soon the hunt will begin.

37:33.833 --> 37:35.445
Hear them!

37:35.469 --> 37:37.379
All of you are going to die!

37:37.403 --> 37:38.648
You're gonna die, too!

37:38.672 --> 37:40.640
All of you are going to die!

37:41.074 --> 37:42.074
All of you!

37:45.278 --> 37:47.189
And away we go.

37:47.213 --> 37:49.582
You! All of you are gonna die!

37:51.485 --> 37:53.888
Time for sacrifice is now.

39:04.324 --> 39:06.560
You owe me one.

39:14.668 --> 39:16.713
- What the hell was that?
- What?

39:16.737 --> 39:18.448
You mean Kayman saving my ass?

39:18.472 --> 39:19.974
Watch your own ass.

39:21.474 --> 39:23.543
- Get to Kayman.
- Alright, open the bag.

39:54.340 --> 39:56.352
No movement, over.

39:56.376 --> 39:58.746
Don't ever cook a grenade
in front of me like that again.

40:10.623 --> 40:11.992
Clear that cave.

40:15.661 --> 40:16.838
How bad?

40:16.862 --> 40:18.340
'Tis but a scratch.

40:18.364 --> 40:19.933
What, are you Shakespeare now?

40:20.833 --> 40:22.579
Target site cleared.

40:22.603 --> 40:24.479
Thanks for the cover, God. Over.

40:24.503 --> 40:26.715
My pleasure, over.

40:26.739 --> 40:28.584
<i>Now get your ass down here
and help with clean up.</i>

40:28.608 --> 40:29.852
<i>Over.</i>

40:29.876 --> 40:31.779
On my way. Kayman, out.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.836
- More military.
- All of 'em?

40:56.503 --> 40:57.869
I think so.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.582
You a soldier?

41:09.682 --> 41:10.950
Marine.

41:11.485 --> 41:12.987
Two tours in Iraq.

41:13.853 --> 41:15.054
Fallujah.

41:58.030 --> 42:01.001
Kayman, come in.
What was that gunfire? Over.

42:24.891 --> 42:26.135
There's this big thing.

42:26.159 --> 42:28.671
There's a big, big, big thing
out there that's gonna eat us.

42:28.695 --> 42:30.372
What is she talking about?

42:30.396 --> 42:32.575
- We have to get out of here...
- Ma'am, listen to me.

42:32.599 --> 42:34.068
You need to remain calm.

42:35.068 --> 42:37.814
- Calm down.
- W-w-we have to leave.

42:37.838 --> 42:41.416
<i>Kayman, what is
the situation up there? Over.</i>

42:41.440 --> 42:43.852
<i>Come in, Hector Kayman.</i>

42:43.876 --> 42:46.021
<i>Do you copy?
This is Artie Cameron.</i>

42:46.045 --> 42:47.647
<i>Do you read? Over.</i>

42:58.157 --> 42:59.936
What the hell's so funny?

42:59.960 --> 43:02.070
They didn't want us out there.

43:02.094 --> 43:04.931
They pushed us out here.
But out here...

43:06.032 --> 43:08.202
Oh, we are provided for.

43:10.603 --> 43:12.005
Where are the other hostages?

43:16.610 --> 43:17.919
Sacrifices.

43:17.943 --> 43:19.155
- Psycho!
- Stand down.

43:19.179 --> 43:20.747
Hey!

43:21.648 --> 43:23.024
Guys!

43:23.048 --> 43:24.126
What the hell
is that moron doing?

43:24.150 --> 43:25.727
Gotta get out of here!

43:25.751 --> 43:26.986
<i>Come in, Artie. Over.</i>

43:27.686 --> 43:28.930
Cameron, over.

43:28.954 --> 43:30.499
<i>Cave's clear at this point.</i>

43:30.523 --> 43:31.968
<i>Found a hostage.</i>

43:31.992 --> 43:33.736
<i>She's in a panicked state.</i>

43:33.760 --> 43:36.004
<i>She keeps talking
about a monster.</i>

43:36.028 --> 43:38.198
<i>Holding for order, sir. Over.</i>

43:39.599 --> 43:41.001
Green, hold.

43:41.768 --> 43:43.336
Kayman, come in. Over.

43:46.139 --> 43:48.809
Hector Kayman,
report immediately. Over.

43:51.043 --> 43:52.211
Run!

43:52.512 --> 43:53.923
It's coming!

43:53.947 --> 43:55.449
Kayman, come in!

44:12.998 --> 44:14.967
<i>Green, Hollis, my location. Now!</i>

44:15.869 --> 44:17.613
Roger.

44:17.637 --> 44:19.277
You're not seriously
going back out there?

44:20.139 --> 44:22.041
- Stay with her.
- You sure?

44:27.246 --> 44:29.348
Fire!

44:47.501 --> 44:48.869
It's a goddamn dragon, bro!

45:02.081 --> 45:03.450
Cave!

45:08.121 --> 45:09.957
You came back for me?

45:10.657 --> 45:13.961
Oh... eh, well, you know.

45:14.126 --> 45:15.461
Stay here.

45:16.730 --> 45:17.964
Yeah, no problem, pal.

45:21.001 --> 45:22.336
Tristan, move!

45:27.740 --> 45:28.841
Move, come on!

45:37.684 --> 45:38.852
Come on!

45:40.052 --> 45:41.287
Go!

46:08.081 --> 46:10.050
What kind of bullshit mission
is this, man?

46:11.117 --> 46:13.628
Kayman and I served in
two goddamn wars together

46:13.652 --> 46:16.332
only to get his ass killed
by a... dragon?

46:16.356 --> 46:17.991
Bobby, I need you here.

46:18.891 --> 46:19.992
Sir.

46:22.195 --> 46:24.874
Kayman and Percy were great men.

46:24.898 --> 46:28.234
And I swear to you, I am not
losing another man today

46:29.202 --> 46:30.904
or civilians for that matter.

46:32.005 --> 46:33.339
Not on Artie Cameron's watch.

46:33.907 --> 46:35.309
- Hey, Artie.
- Yeah.

46:35.675 --> 46:36.877
I'm on recon.

46:37.177 --> 46:38.787
Got your six.

46:38.811 --> 46:40.811
You're not going anywhere
till you fix yourself up.

46:44.751 --> 46:46.061
What about you two?

46:46.085 --> 46:47.521
Do you require
medical attention?

46:48.253 --> 46:49.522
I don't need shit.

46:50.889 --> 46:52.325
No.

47:01.668 --> 47:02.668
Need help?

47:03.802 --> 47:05.405
Oh, no, Miss. I, uh...

47:06.072 --> 47:07.916
I've done this a million times.

47:07.940 --> 47:09.251
Yeah, but you're...
you're getting dirt in it

47:09.275 --> 47:11.477
so... take this off.

47:16.650 --> 47:18.185
- Bullets?
- Yeah.

47:19.786 --> 47:21.631
In a sock?

47:21.655 --> 47:25.200
- Yeah.
- Isn't that dangerous?

47:25.224 --> 47:27.360
Well, it looks like you guessed
my middle name.

47:39.938 --> 47:42.108
Man, what do you... huh?

47:44.911 --> 47:46.187
I mean, did you see that thing?

47:46.211 --> 47:47.513
How could I miss it?

47:49.282 --> 47:50.684
Yeah, but...

47:52.918 --> 47:54.453
Come on, man.
What the hell, right?

47:55.454 --> 47:57.399
Oh, I guess you see these

47:57.423 --> 47:59.526
flying, fire-breathing monsters
every day, huh?

48:00.427 --> 48:02.062
Look, Hollis.

48:03.228 --> 48:05.907
I've learned to go
into every situation

48:05.931 --> 48:08.367
expecting to see something
I've never seen before.

48:09.068 --> 48:10.412
You know why?

48:10.436 --> 48:12.148
No.

48:12.172 --> 48:14.783
That way, the only time
you'll see my ass surprised

48:14.807 --> 48:16.310
is when nothing happens.

48:18.043 --> 48:19.646
Yeah, and how often
does that happen?

48:20.146 --> 48:21.448
Never has.

48:40.900 --> 48:43.537
So, you guys clearly
aren't regular military.

48:44.436 --> 48:45.705
What's your deal?

48:46.139 --> 48:47.441
Was...

48:47.806 --> 48:49.452
Army.

48:49.476 --> 48:51.153
Twenty-two years.

48:51.177 --> 48:52.412
The mercs?

48:55.481 --> 48:56.716
Soldiers of Fortune, right?

48:57.951 --> 48:59.419
Like contractors?

48:59.918 --> 49:02.155
Yeah, like that.

49:10.130 --> 49:13.008
I'm thinking this is the work
of the vagrants

49:13.032 --> 49:14.768
picking up after
our dragon friend.

49:15.835 --> 49:17.947
Jesus.

49:17.971 --> 49:19.971
How many people do you think
this thing has killed?

49:33.552 --> 49:35.121
What do you got down yours?

49:35.822 --> 49:37.398
Uh...

49:37.422 --> 49:40.236
possible way out, but...

49:40.260 --> 49:42.504
it's too narrow
for that dragon to fit through.

49:42.528 --> 49:44.397
I got a dead end
in about ten metres.

49:45.097 --> 49:46.499
So we'll just call that clear.

49:47.867 --> 49:48.867
Clear.

49:55.175 --> 49:57.210
So, you mercs got names or?

49:58.110 --> 50:01.481
Yeah. Artie Cameron, Tristan.

50:03.583 --> 50:05.394
It's all clear ahead, sir.

50:05.418 --> 50:07.061
Possible exit strategy.

50:07.085 --> 50:08.463
Too small for the enemy
to come through.

50:08.487 --> 50:10.056
No light.

50:10.422 --> 50:12.458
Green, Hollis.

50:12.826 --> 50:13.826
Ma'am.

50:14.827 --> 50:15.827
So...

50:18.063 --> 50:19.465
what do you know about
this dragon?

50:23.302 --> 50:24.604
Not much.

50:25.137 --> 50:27.816
He flies, breathes fire.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.251
Any idea where it come from?

50:29.275 --> 50:31.387
I have a hypothesis.

50:31.411 --> 50:34.122
The fracking on the other side
of the mountain

50:34.146 --> 50:35.490
it collapsed a mine.

50:35.514 --> 50:37.827
Yeah, that's probably it.

50:37.851 --> 50:40.896
It's a mine dragon
chasing black gold, right?

50:40.920 --> 50:42.997
The first two reported missing
were the ones who were sent

50:43.021 --> 50:45.166
to inspect the damage.

50:45.190 --> 50:47.236
Where the hell did it come from
then, huh, smart guy?

50:47.260 --> 50:50.171
I don't know. Do I look like
a goddamn zookeeper?

50:50.195 --> 50:51.941
No.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.500
You look like a hillbilly.

50:55.201 --> 50:57.146
- You're the hillbilly.
- Hey, come on.

50:57.170 --> 50:59.205
Listen, the more important
question is

51:01.074 --> 51:02.109
how do we stop it?

51:05.311 --> 51:07.114
Alright. So what about
those vagrants?

51:07.447 --> 51:09.191
What were they doing out there?

51:09.215 --> 51:11.392
Looks like they worshipped
the damn thing like a god.

51:11.416 --> 51:13.119
I think that there's
more to it than that.

51:13.385 --> 51:14.787
What do you mean?

51:15.588 --> 51:16.890
I don't know, I...

51:18.123 --> 51:21.260
I saw it blow some sort
of smoke or gas on them.

51:23.195 --> 51:24.955
If you could've seen
the way that they looked

51:25.331 --> 51:27.242
how they talked...

51:27.266 --> 51:29.044
it was almost
like they were under...

51:29.068 --> 51:31.146
a spell or something.

51:31.170 --> 51:33.173
Funky voodoo magic, man?

51:35.675 --> 51:37.210
They were all vets.

51:37.476 --> 51:39.555
This is some bullshit.

51:39.579 --> 51:41.390
Your sleazy-ass mayor buddy
got us out here

51:41.414 --> 51:42.523
killing our own.

51:42.547 --> 51:45.227
Julius, calm down.

51:45.251 --> 51:47.095
Mayor Mordry hired you?

51:47.119 --> 51:48.664
What do you know about him?

51:48.688 --> 51:50.566
I know that he kicked out
all the homeless

51:50.590 --> 51:53.669
through some "clean up
the streets" campaign.

51:53.693 --> 51:56.730
They have nowhere else to go
so they come out to the forest.

51:57.496 --> 51:58.573
Look, it just made things

51:58.597 --> 52:01.075
a lot more complicated out here.

52:01.099 --> 52:06.515
Hey, streets are much safer
thanks to Mayor Mordry.

52:06.539 --> 52:07.941
Yeah. How did you get out here?

52:12.045 --> 52:13.647
You know anything else
about this thing?

52:15.315 --> 52:16.683
Yeah.

52:19.318 --> 52:20.452
It kills your friends.

52:27.492 --> 52:28.761
We're safe for now.

52:30.096 --> 52:31.430
Get some rest.

52:45.378 --> 52:48.281
Look, Hollis,
I know you're new here.

52:49.114 --> 52:51.317
But Artie says you're
the best at what you do.

52:53.518 --> 52:54.820
Well...

52:56.655 --> 52:58.390
I don't know about the best.

53:00.159 --> 53:01.528
I am good at what I do.

53:02.628 --> 53:04.598
You just better bring
the bang, Boom-Boom.

53:07.500 --> 53:08.901
Please do not call me that.

53:09.501 --> 53:11.379
Sorry, Boom-Boom.

53:11.403 --> 53:13.682
You part of the team now.

53:13.706 --> 53:17.086
Literally no one else
on this team has a nickname.

53:17.110 --> 53:18.678
Welcome aboard, Boom-Boom.

53:30.056 --> 53:32.559
Anybody else hear that?

53:34.059 --> 53:35.059
Yep.

54:01.253 --> 54:02.289
Fire in the hole!

54:06.291 --> 54:08.827
- Green!
- This way! Move, move, move!

54:12.164 --> 54:13.499
You staying here?

54:30.615 --> 54:31.827
Wait.

54:31.851 --> 54:33.386
Where's Griffin?

54:39.525 --> 54:40.960
Where the hell
did you dickheads go?

54:52.438 --> 54:53.807
Find us a way out.

54:54.407 --> 54:55.742
Now.

55:04.282 --> 55:06.051
Oh, come on.

55:17.762 --> 55:19.064
Help me up.

55:20.833 --> 55:22.368
One, two, three.

55:31.543 --> 55:32.878
Artie.

55:34.447 --> 55:36.557
What are you thinking?

55:36.581 --> 55:39.385
That it's time to put you
to work, Boom-Boom.

55:44.891 --> 55:46.393
Alright.

55:57.769 --> 55:59.104
Bold Eagles forever.

56:08.313 --> 56:09.749
On your feet, Hillbilly.

56:16.322 --> 56:18.300
Hey, man.
Sorry I called you "Hillbilly".

56:18.324 --> 56:19.334
Even though you just
called me one again.

56:19.358 --> 56:20.527
Yeah, shut up!

56:21.527 --> 56:23.162
Come on, Hollis.

56:24.630 --> 56:25.865
Almost there.

56:28.400 --> 56:30.778
Tristan, move it!
Move, move, move.

56:30.802 --> 56:32.613
Good to go.

56:32.637 --> 56:33.749
- Move!
- Better be.

56:33.773 --> 56:35.107
Move!

56:36.342 --> 56:37.676
Come on, come on.

56:38.710 --> 56:40.045
Move, boys!

56:44.617 --> 56:46.327
Go, Artie, go.

56:46.351 --> 56:47.720
Not on your life.

57:05.438 --> 57:06.839
Almost there.

57:10.543 --> 57:11.675
Come on, Artie.

57:16.315 --> 57:17.925
Artie, let's go.

57:17.949 --> 57:19.551
Artie...

57:20.619 --> 57:21.954
I'm not going anywhere.

57:23.021 --> 57:24.823
But you are.

57:32.864 --> 57:34.533
Give me the launcher!

57:38.036 --> 57:39.036
Go.

57:42.007 --> 57:44.710
Alright, shithead. Eat this.

57:55.521 --> 57:57.089
I didn't...
I didn't blow it, I swear.

58:10.802 --> 58:12.004
Where's Artie?

58:20.679 --> 58:22.214
Blew his ass to hell, man.

58:29.954 --> 58:31.223
Artie's gone.

58:32.023 --> 58:33.659
And I know we all...

58:36.896 --> 58:38.031
What are we gonna do?

58:41.833 --> 58:43.168
We're exposed here.

58:43.936 --> 58:45.613
To what?

58:45.637 --> 58:46.738
Dragon's dead, right?

58:52.110 --> 58:54.856
We also no longer have
a map for this region

58:54.880 --> 58:56.457
which leaves you, Ms Peters

58:56.481 --> 58:58.459
as our most knowledgeable asset
on this land.

58:58.483 --> 58:59.651
Hey.

59:00.686 --> 59:01.955
OK.

59:02.856 --> 59:05.834
Alright, there's a ranger
station not too far from here.

59:05.858 --> 59:09.370
Um, our best bet would be
to follow the draw

59:09.394 --> 59:10.972
up to the plateau.

59:10.996 --> 59:12.298
Leads right to the forest.

59:13.065 --> 59:14.300
We move now.

59:14.733 --> 59:16.611
Yeah, sure. OK.

59:16.635 --> 59:18.203
Um, this way.

59:18.737 --> 59:19.972
We're Oscar Mike.

59:21.407 --> 59:22.775
Wait...

59:23.041 --> 59:24.209
we're not resting?

59:26.045 --> 59:27.946
Guys, seriously.

59:29.081 --> 59:32.085
You can't take a...
five... five minutes max?

59:49.434 --> 59:51.003
Gotta be kidding me!

59:53.105 --> 59:54.406
Double time.

01:01:44.148 --> 01:01:45.851
I tell you what...

01:01:48.219 --> 01:01:49.888
When this is all over...

01:01:51.523 --> 01:01:54.392
I'm gonna
take a long-ass vacation.

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:57.396
Yeah, I heard that.

01:01:57.896 --> 01:01:59.965
- Cancun?
- Nah.

01:02:01.534 --> 01:02:02.902
Tahiti?

01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:08.807
I ever tell you about
Mikey May, Tristan?

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:15.023
Mikey May was my best friend

01:02:15.047 --> 01:02:17.517
from as early as I even knew
what a best friend was.

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:21.020
You see, we grew up together.

01:02:21.753 --> 01:02:24.064
We went to school together.

01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:28.169
We played football,
we served together.

01:02:28.193 --> 01:02:30.997
We cleared buildings door
to door in Baghdad together.

01:02:32.231 --> 01:02:34.534
Defended Kamdesh
against the Taliban together.

01:02:36.135 --> 01:02:39.247
And the whole time,
no matter what we was doing

01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:40.849
or what was going on

01:02:40.873 --> 01:02:43.176
Mikey would never stop
talking about Tahiti.

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:48.088
Apparently, he went once
with his parents on vacation

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:50.248
when he was like,
I don't know, 12.

01:02:51.916 --> 01:02:54.452
And from that day on, he would
talk about nothing else.

01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:57.999
Didn't matter where we deployed.

01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:01.702
Even some of the places
that wasn't hazard pay

01:03:01.726 --> 01:03:04.639
or complete shitholes,
they were never good enough.

01:03:04.663 --> 01:03:06.499
They were never Tahiti.

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:09.945
When he got out of the service

01:03:09.969 --> 01:03:12.305
he moved there and opened a bar
and, uh...

01:03:13.806 --> 01:03:14.973
I haven't seen him since.

01:03:16.041 --> 01:03:17.852
Because of Mikey May

01:03:17.876 --> 01:03:20.346
I've wanted to go
to Tahiti my whole life.

01:03:22.014 --> 01:03:26.093
I figured, hell,
maybe after a few more jobs

01:03:26.117 --> 01:03:28.553
I'll go pay him a visit, see
what all the fuss was about.

01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:33.125
One day, I told myself.

01:03:34.793 --> 01:03:37.230
One day,
I'd go see Mikey in Tahiti.

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:41.901
But now...

01:03:44.268 --> 01:03:46.271
I don't give a damn
if I ever see Tahiti

01:03:47.338 --> 01:03:49.950
cos I will spend
every day I got left

01:03:49.974 --> 01:03:51.919
every breath slaying that dragon

01:03:51.943 --> 01:03:53.822
even if I have to carve
that motherfucker

01:03:53.846 --> 01:03:55.624
from the inside out.

01:03:55.648 --> 01:03:56.992
Fuckin' A, let's do this.

01:03:57.016 --> 01:03:58.325
That's a negative.

01:03:58.349 --> 01:04:01.629
Hollis, Tristan, you are
to escort these citizens

01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:03.289
safely back to town.

01:04:04.856 --> 01:04:06.024
Take them back?

01:04:06.224 --> 01:04:07.869
Look...

01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:09.595
Artie brought us here together

01:04:10.929 --> 01:04:14.041
and when he went down,
this became my team.

01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:15.977
Now, he made a promise
there would be no more losses

01:04:16.001 --> 01:04:17.144
and I intend to keep his word.

01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:19.280
He didn't mean that you were
supposed to take this on.

01:04:19.304 --> 01:04:20.584
I don't want to hear it, Hollis.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.785
Now, I've already come
to terms with it.

01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:25.919
I will stay until the job's done

01:04:25.943 --> 01:04:27.187
see this mission through.

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:30.057
Now, we've all been
through a lot together

01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:32.693
but this is where your part
of the journey ends.

01:04:32.717 --> 01:04:34.920
But I can assure you
one damn thing.

01:04:36.722 --> 01:04:38.324
I will slay
that scaly son of a bitch.

01:04:40.826 --> 01:04:43.238
- Julius.
- That's an order, Tristan.

01:04:43.262 --> 01:04:46.006
You and Hollis are to take
Miss Peters and Mr Griffin

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.443
back to town
and you are to leave now!

01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:50.111
This is bullshit.

01:04:50.135 --> 01:04:52.271
That bastard killed
my best friend.

01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:56.050
I'm not going home
while that thing's still

01:04:56.074 --> 01:04:58.952
flying around shitting fire.

01:04:58.976 --> 01:05:00.287
You've been running away
from this thing

01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:02.057
as long as I've known you.

01:05:02.081 --> 01:05:04.216
OK, yeah. I been running...

01:05:05.384 --> 01:05:07.185
cos it's a goddamn dragon!

01:05:10.121 --> 01:05:13.525
I'm still out here cos...
because I lost people too.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.361
You don't let anybody
get away with that

01:05:16.994 --> 01:05:18.597
not even a dumb-ass lizard.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.365
Look, Hillbilly's right.

01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:23.077
Look, I feel you guys.

01:05:23.101 --> 01:05:26.504
I don't care how much of a
badass you think you are, sir.

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.176
But if you actually intend
to kill that thing

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:34.155
you're gonna need more
than your two strong arms.

01:05:34.179 --> 01:05:35.747
Look, there's no rank out here.

01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:38.149
The man paying us has passed.

01:05:38.983 --> 01:05:39.894
I mean, we're nothing
but a bunch

01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:41.453
of dirtbag civilians now.

01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:45.324
You can't make us do shit, sir.

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:02.308
I was just thinking...

01:06:03.842 --> 01:06:06.019
instead of your lonesome ass
running around out here

01:06:06.043 --> 01:06:08.013
like a piece of meat
waiting to be barbequed...

01:06:09.313 --> 01:06:10.782
you could accept
some help for once.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:17.223
There's a lake
not too far from here.

01:06:18.956 --> 01:06:21.159
There's been a lot
of avalanches this year.

01:06:22.427 --> 01:06:24.397
With Boom-Boom's help,
we could trigger one.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:28.008
Trap that beast.

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:29.434
Bury it in the lake.

01:06:30.268 --> 01:06:32.137
Not even a dragon
can survive that.

01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:34.048
I'm on board.

01:06:34.072 --> 01:06:35.374
Hell yeah, that could work.

01:06:39.077 --> 01:06:41.180
Sort of like water beats fire,
huh?

01:06:43.447 --> 01:06:46.260
Alright, I'm in.

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:49.097
But we need to move
and we need to move fast.

01:06:49.121 --> 01:06:50.481
I don't know how much time
we have.

01:07:47.144 --> 01:07:48.144
So what are you thinking?

01:07:49.146 --> 01:07:50.425
I'm thinking we set some traps.

01:07:50.449 --> 01:07:51.817
Y'all have dragon traps?

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:53.885
Snares, here.

01:07:56.054 --> 01:07:57.432
Why don't we just feed it
this dude's bombs

01:07:57.456 --> 01:07:59.466
and blow its ass up?

01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:00.468
What are you gonna do?
You gonna walk up

01:08:00.492 --> 01:08:03.104
- and hand feed it?
- No, he just eats the bag

01:08:03.128 --> 01:08:05.139
and then you shoot the bag
and boom!

01:08:05.163 --> 01:08:07.533
C4 does not explode
when you shoot it.

01:08:07.932 --> 01:08:09.200
Doesn't it?

01:08:10.335 --> 01:08:13.247
There, right on that ridge

01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:14.839
that's where you want
to put your C4.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.050
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:17.073 --> 01:08:18.343
You got this, brother.

01:08:19.912 --> 01:08:22.348
Alright, Boom-Boom.
Time to shine.

01:08:23.215 --> 01:08:25.259
We need you up there
doing what you do.

01:08:25.283 --> 01:08:27.060
Now, once we lower
the dragon in position

01:08:27.085 --> 01:08:29.520
that's when you bring the
mountain down on his scaly ass.

01:08:30.322 --> 01:08:31.432
Can do.

01:08:31.456 --> 01:08:33.591
Tristan, 550 cords
and tripwires.

01:08:34.126 --> 01:08:35.491
Roger.

01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:41.308
OK.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:42.977
- It's on like Donkey Kong.
- On it.

01:08:43.001 --> 01:08:44.336
Gwen, foliage and cover.

01:09:11.328 --> 01:09:13.497
You really think all this
"Predator" shit's gonna work?

01:09:14.599 --> 01:09:16.968
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:00.655
Alright.

01:10:00.679 --> 01:10:02.448
She's good to go. Over.

01:10:03.314 --> 01:10:05.416
Copy that.
Now bring your ass down.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.389
Target is en route.

01:12:19.551 --> 01:12:20.919
Hello.

01:12:24.788 --> 01:12:26.891
Good... Good dragon.

01:12:35.432 --> 01:12:36.677
Come on, dragon.

01:12:36.701 --> 01:12:37.903
OK.

01:12:42.506 --> 01:12:43.975
Just a little bit more.

01:12:57.354 --> 01:12:58.589
Just a little bit more.

01:13:03.828 --> 01:13:06.198
Good dragon, come on.

01:13:11.435 --> 01:13:12.780
No, no.

01:13:12.804 --> 01:13:14.705
No, no, no. It's OK.

01:13:17.775 --> 01:13:18.907
Engage!

01:13:24.882 --> 01:13:26.819
Come on, come on!

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:41.566
Hollis,
keep that trigger finger ready.

01:13:43.368 --> 01:13:44.636
Copy that!

01:13:46.805 --> 01:13:48.237
Gwen.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.512
You OK?

01:13:56.448 --> 01:13:58.050
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

01:13:58.649 --> 01:14:00.151
Hey, what are you doing?

01:14:03.954 --> 01:14:05.824
Sacrifices must be made.

01:15:14.658 --> 01:15:15.827
Bold Eagles, baby!

01:15:19.331 --> 01:15:20.331
Come on.

01:15:22.867 --> 01:15:24.010
Hollis.

01:15:24.034 --> 01:15:25.946
Shut up, man. Not right now.

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:30.642
Did Green ever tell you
his story about the surprises?

01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:32.343
Yeah, he did.

01:15:33.912 --> 01:15:36.890
Yeah, well,
he's full of shit, man.

01:15:36.914 --> 01:15:40.185
Well, hang on...
I think we all were.

01:15:41.353 --> 01:15:42.633
Hold that.
Hold that right there.

01:15:45.989 --> 01:15:47.592
You OK, Gwen?

01:15:51.796 --> 01:15:54.062
Hollis, I'ma try to lead it back
your way! Get ready!

01:15:55.734 --> 01:15:57.336
Do you read me? Over.

01:16:05.743 --> 01:16:07.722
Gwen, this ain't fair!

01:16:07.746 --> 01:16:09.347
I don't wanna hit a woman!

01:16:33.805 --> 01:16:34.973
What happened?

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.843
Uh, long story.

01:16:39.644 --> 01:16:41.113
Did you shoot me?

01:16:44.649 --> 01:16:45.951
Look, a dragon!

01:17:03.967 --> 01:17:05.612
Come on. Lay down, lay down.

01:17:05.636 --> 01:17:08.081
Green, I'm with Tristan.

01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:10.884
He is hit, but he is OK. Over.

01:17:10.908 --> 01:17:13.454
Julius, are you on this line?
Anybody on this line?

01:17:13.478 --> 01:17:14.812
Come in, over.

01:17:15.913 --> 01:17:17.114
Come in, Goddammit!

01:17:25.823 --> 01:17:27.258
Hold that, alright?

01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:28.760
Yeah.

01:17:29.527 --> 01:17:31.096
OK. I'll be right back.

01:17:32.997 --> 01:17:34.266
I'm not going anywhere.

01:17:35.065 --> 01:17:36.467
Fuck.

01:18:10.534 --> 01:18:11.534
Blow it!

01:18:12.636 --> 01:18:14.202
Close enough
for government work.

01:18:35.827 --> 01:18:37.737
Wait!

01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:38.973
Griffin!

01:18:38.997 --> 01:18:41.299
You OK, bro?

01:18:43.568 --> 01:18:45.971
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

01:18:46.537 --> 01:18:47.538
Revenge.

01:18:48.907 --> 01:18:50.307
Bold Eagles forever, baby!

01:18:58.682 --> 01:19:00.661
W-W-What are you looking for?

01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:01.996
- The detonator!
- Detonator, OK...

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.488
Where-where is it?

01:19:07.891 --> 01:19:09.169
Hey, fire fart!

01:19:09.193 --> 01:19:12.164
Come and get me! You ain't shit!

01:19:18.903 --> 01:19:20.947
No, I don't see it! Did it fall?

01:19:20.971 --> 01:19:22.571
I don't know.
It's somewhere around here.

01:19:27.211 --> 01:19:28.547
You looking for this?

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:34.386
I'm gonna throw a perfect strike
right up your ass.

01:19:42.926 --> 01:19:44.061
Fire in your hole.

01:19:53.738 --> 01:19:54.682
Must be out of range.

01:19:54.706 --> 01:19:56.106
- The hell?
- What?

01:19:59.944 --> 01:20:01.446
It's gotta be higher and closer.

01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:07.961
Just gimme the damn thing.

01:20:07.985 --> 01:20:10.020
Alright, look, code is set.

01:20:10.854 --> 01:20:12.189
Just pull the trigger.

01:20:40.851 --> 01:20:42.287
Shit.

01:21:01.939 --> 01:21:03.675
Why ain't this thing working,
Boom-Boom?

01:21:08.445 --> 01:21:09.857
Fall back.

01:21:09.881 --> 01:21:11.415
There's no blasting caps.

01:21:14.985 --> 01:21:17.989
- He can't blow it?
- Green, get back here!

01:21:20.725 --> 01:21:21.960
You know what?

01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:24.161
Fuck it.

01:21:39.711 --> 01:21:40.712
Come get some.

01:21:48.019 --> 01:21:49.387
No way.

01:22:11.309 --> 01:22:14.755
That's it.

01:22:14.779 --> 01:22:16.247
Show me some magic, Puff.

01:22:32.063 --> 01:22:33.397
Hell yeah! Ow.

01:22:34.398 --> 01:22:37.235
Oh, Green, that was glorious!

01:22:42.105 --> 01:22:44.508
Great shot, great shot.

01:22:46.144 --> 01:22:48.213
<i>Green, are you there? Over.</i>

01:22:49.012 --> 01:22:50.481
I'm here.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:54.586
I think I got him.

01:22:57.188 --> 01:23:00.357
- Yeah, buddy, you got him.
- He's alive?

01:23:01.359 --> 01:23:02.969
I guess you were wrong about C4

01:23:02.993 --> 01:23:05.171
being detonated
by a bullet, huh?

01:23:05.195 --> 01:23:07.808
Well, that's cos I got a lot
more than C4 in that bag.

01:23:07.832 --> 01:23:09.977
<i>Grenades, claymores.</i>

01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:11.411
That doesn't sound safe.

01:23:11.435 --> 01:23:13.671
And that's why we call you
Boom-Boom.

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.985
Hate to break up
the positive vibes

01:23:18.009 --> 01:23:21.779
but I'd love to not spend
another night in this forest.

01:23:23.213 --> 01:23:24.248
It's scary.

01:23:25.216 --> 01:23:26.518
OK.

01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:33.123
You kept your promise, Artie.

01:23:34.958 --> 01:23:36.394
You kept your promise.

01:23:47.872 --> 01:23:49.549
Well, I appreciate

01:23:49.573 --> 01:23:51.341
the party's support
and I look forward to...

01:23:52.909 --> 01:23:54.412
What the hell?

01:23:54.878 --> 01:23:56.223
Blue Falcon.

01:23:56.247 --> 01:23:58.125
What? Where's Artie Cameron?

01:23:58.149 --> 01:24:00.994
Artie's dead,
you son of a bitch!

01:24:01.018 --> 01:24:03.964
And so are Percy Robertson,
Hector Kayman

01:24:03.988 --> 01:24:06.433
and countless other vets
you sent us out to slaughter!

01:24:06.457 --> 01:24:08.000
Whoa, whoa!

01:24:08.024 --> 01:24:09.793
You're a goddamn disgrace.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.176
You better hope I never have
a reason to come back here.

01:24:25.475 --> 01:24:26.711
Pogue.

01:25:02.979 --> 01:25:04.715
I know he would be proud
of you guys.

01:25:05.548 --> 01:25:06.751
Of all of us.

01:25:07.385 --> 01:25:09.220
- Hillbilly, too.
- Yeah.

01:25:09.619 --> 01:25:11.221
That's the truth.

01:25:12.355 --> 01:25:14.000
Alright.

01:25:14.024 --> 01:25:17.437
So, if dragons are real

01:25:17.461 --> 01:25:19.696
does that mean that there's
other monsters out there?

01:25:22.132 --> 01:25:23.368
Don't know.

01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:26.703
And right now,
I'ma be honest with you, Hollis.

01:25:29.239 --> 01:25:30.574
I don't give a shit.

01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:34.479
OK.

01:25:37.347 --> 01:25:39.617
Let's get outta here.

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.250
Oh, hey, what's up, bro?

01:26:38.274 --> 01:26:40.434
Bet you're wondering how
the hell I'm still alive, huh?

01:26:42.345 --> 01:26:44.256
I'll tell you. I'm alive...

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.058
cos I'm the smartest,
most badass hero

01:26:46.082 --> 01:26:47.760
this world has ever seen.

01:26:47.784 --> 01:26:49.729
That dumb-ass dragon,
he's so stupid

01:26:49.753 --> 01:26:52.098
he didn't chew me
or nothing, man.

01:26:52.122 --> 01:26:54.567
So as soon as I got in there,
I dropped the explosives

01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:57.403
and I made
a beeline to his B-hole.

01:26:57.427 --> 01:26:59.327
And here I am, alive.

01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:02.476
Covered in dragon shit.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.144
So I'm gonna go wash off.

01:27:05.168 --> 01:27:06.808
Shut up, squirrel!
You weren't even there.

01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:11.810
