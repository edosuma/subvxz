Alright, we good?

00:09.600 --> 00:13.120
Thomas, I am very
uncomfortable about this.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.560
It's just a sausage sizzle eating
competition. It'll be fun!

00:15.560 --> 00:17.360
Do I have to wear the flag?

00:17.360 --> 00:20.800
You're right. You are...
Babe, you are right.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.200
I'll just pop... There we go.
Better?

00:23.200 --> 00:25.560
Can't Sophie do this?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.160
You know she can't.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.280
In fact, here she comes now. Sophie!

00:34.720 --> 00:37.200
It's so lovely to see you embrace
the spirit of Australia Day.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.080
Actually, I was just
talking to Charlie

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
about your discomfort

00:40.080 --> 00:42.320
in being around the...
you know, you-know-what.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.360
Ever since that disastrous
cucumber farm story,

00:45.360 --> 00:48.320
the optics of me being near
anything phallic are...

00:48.320 --> 00:49.880
..problematic.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.800
I can't be a meme again.
I just... I can't.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.800
How about the fact I'm an Aboriginal
person, wearing an Australian flag,

00:56.800 --> 00:59.200
about to stuff sausages
down my hole?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.280
How are those optics?

01:00.280 --> 01:03.120
Great! It's inclusive, it's diverse.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.120
It's unifying. But most of all,
it's great television.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.320

Alright, here we go, everyone.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.800

Here we are at Australia Day's

Stupid telemarketers!

02:10.800 --> 02:12.320
As I was saying...

02:13.320 --> 02:16.000
You'll need to work as a team
to survive.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.400
Question. Is this compulsory?

02:19.400 --> 02:25.000
Is survival in the post-apocalypse
world compulsory?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.040
No.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.080
If you want to stay at Eden 2, it is.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.600
Yeah, but I'm just gonna
slow everyone down.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.320
That's true.
All Charlie's good for is meat.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.920
Juicy meat.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.680
Ew! Don't sexualise me.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.680
Ew! No!

02:38.680 --> 02:40.880
I was just assessing
which cuts we're gonna have to make

02:40.880 --> 02:42.280
when we eventually have to eat you.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.040
The thigh. Thigh.
Yeah.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.320
Thigh! Thigh! Thigh!

02:47.320 --> 02:49.600
No, no, wait. Hold on.
That's offensive.

Thank you, Jayden.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.480
What? No, not you.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.480
I resent Guy's characterisations of
First Nations people as cannibals.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.480
See, my pop always says
that plays into 'savage' stereotypes

02:59.480 --> 03:02.920
used by the white man
to justify colonisation.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.680
So if we do eat Charlie,

03:04.680 --> 03:07.440
we do it not
because we're Aboriginal,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.480
but through
our own self-determination.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.160
Nobody's eating anyone. Yet.

Relax, Charlie.
This is my pop's land.

to work as a team.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.040
And every team needs a leader.
Every tribe had a chief.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.000
Actually, 'chief',
along with 'tribe', 'clan', etc,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.320
are white terms applied to
Aboriginal people to make us seem...

04:35.320 --> 04:38.560
Whatever. We need to unite around
the alpha of the pack and that's me!

that the panther escaped
the circus in the 1970s

and now lives here,
in the wilds of Western Sydney,

occasionally glimpsed,
but never truly seen.

We're surrounded by
60,000 years of Aboriginal culture,

is interested

Shh! How many people has
the Penrith panther killed?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.520
Great question, Guy. Nobody knows.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.840
Zero. The panther doesn't exist.

06:31.840 --> 06:36.000
Charlie, you know, without the 'T'
in 'native', you're just 'naive'.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.280
And the 'T' is that most
of the panther's victims

06:39.280 --> 06:42.200
have been misattributed
to the serial killer Ivan Milat.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.160

Kelly! Kelly, come on, just...

10:30.320 --> 10:32.720
Kelly, I was... Can we talk, please?

10:32.720 --> 10:34.840
I was just jiggling out a wee.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.400
Yeah, the wee was stuck,

10:36.400 --> 10:38.880
and so I was just squeezing
the wee out

10:38.880 --> 10:41.000
so that it wouldn't leak later.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.920
Kelly, just...please!
Enough!

10:42.920 --> 10:45.720
As chief of the tribe,
I order you to make out and make up.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.720
Great.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.720
Why don't you stick to being
chief of minding your own business?

10:51.160 --> 10:53.400
Kelly, please! Come on!

10:54.400 --> 10:55.640
(BRANCH SNAPS)
Oh!

10:55.640 --> 10:57.040
Come on!

11:01.400 --> 11:03.840
We're being watched. I can feel it.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.440
If the panther's out there,

11:06.440 --> 11:10.040
this majestic piece of machinery
will find it.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.080
It measures energy wavelengths,

11:12.080 --> 11:14.960
dialled specifically
into the feline EQ bandwidth.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.160
You're welcome.
No.

11:16.160 --> 11:20.320
You use your machine, but in combat,
there's only one thing I trust.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.800
That thing is me.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.760
Stand down, soldier.
We need the panther alive!

11:26.640 --> 11:29.000
Guy? Kirby?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Monty's instructions are clear -
stick together!

11:32.000 --> 11:35.360
MONTY: "Aboriginal people
lived in small family..."

11:35.360 --> 11:36.960
I don't have time for this!

11:37.960 --> 11:39.360
Ugh!
(THUD!)

11:41.000 --> 11:42.600
Fuck.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.000
Ohhh!
(THUD!)

12:04.000 --> 12:07.280
I'm hit! Man down! Man down!

12:07.280 --> 12:08.440
Is it bad?

12:08.440 --> 12:10.640
Is it bad?
I think the arrow grazed your leg.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.400
Can you walk?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.840
Can I walk?

12:13.840 --> 12:16.040

my whole life, ladies.

(GUY GROANS)

12:17.120 --> 12:18.840
KELLY: Did the panther
do this to Guy?

12:18.840 --> 12:20.960
CHARLIE: No, he hit himself.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.480
While trying to kill the panther
to save you!

12:23.480 --> 12:26.040
The bolt might've hit an artery.
OK, it didn't hit an artery.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.440
I worked as a veterinary's assistant
in the summer of '99.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.520
Guy, we have to take your pants off
so I can check the wound.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.560
Hey, whoa, whoa...

12:34.560 --> 12:36.040
OK.

Wait. Is that a nappy?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.760
What? No!

12:45.760 --> 12:47.200
These are military-issued
recon briefs.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.840
That's a nappy!
No!

12:48.840 --> 12:50.480
Desert Storm snipers wear them
on sorties.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.960
It's still a nappy.
No, it's not!

12:51.960 --> 12:53.720
You're wearing a nappy.
Stop saying that!

12:53.720 --> 12:55.640
Come on, now. Let me see.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.080
Come on, bub.
There, that's a good bub.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.960
It's stopped bleeding. For now.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.680
Wow. Wow. That was really brave
of you, Kelly, hey? Well done.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.840
Don't think you can sweet-talk your
way out of the doghouse, Lionel.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.920
Guys, we have a problem.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.960
I think I'm about to fill
my recon briefs.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.080
What?
Oh!

13:12.080 --> 13:13.520
The adrenaline, it's making me...

13:13.520 --> 13:15.880
Don't you dare. I'm warning you!
This is not a game!

13:15.880 --> 13:17.880
And this is not a nappy!
This is the apocalypse.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.600

you will change it!

13:30.160 --> 13:32.520
Are you eating a sausage?
What?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.280
You said you couldn't be
around sausages

13:35.280 --> 13:38.040
because of anxiety and trauma
and memes!

13:38.040 --> 13:41.440
My struggle with ingesting
phallic-shaped foods

13:41.440 --> 13:43.560
is a daily war, Charlie.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.600
And today was a good day.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.880
Sophie, what's wrong?

13:46.880 --> 13:48.320
Charlie shamed me.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.600
Charlie, you made Sophie cry?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.720
(CRIES)
Unprofessional!

13:52.720 --> 13:54.800
'Unprofessional'?!
Yeah.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.680
I just ate 15 sausages!

13:56.680 --> 14:01.520
Can you just please stop saying
S-A-S-A-U-G-E-S? It's triggering.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.760
Well, it seems there
are some shaft shapes

14:03.760 --> 14:05.720
that Sophie is
very comfortable with.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.200
What are you talking about?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.840
You tell me, Thomas!

14:08.840 --> 14:11.240
Sophie, come over here. You alright?
It's just really unfair!

14:11.240 --> 14:12.440
Are you OK?
Yeah.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.440
Oh! Oh.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.080

You're not still mad, are you?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.080
I thought our promise was clear.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.760
Look, I know, no excuses. But I
just...think you're overreacting.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.760
I'm overreacting?

15:04.760 --> 15:06.960
Yeah, it's not like you haven't
seen someone do this before.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.840
Oh, ha ha! Hundreds!

15:08.840 --> 15:10.840
Just not you.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.320
OK, I get it.

15:12.320 --> 15:17.080
All I'm saying is remember when we
made that pledge of celibacy to God,

15:17.080 --> 15:20.240
we also promised to remain
sex-positive.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.920
Lionel, we have to take
our promise seriously.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.760
Otherwise, what's the point?

15:25.760 --> 15:31.520
We should just strip off and do it
right here, right now.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.640
Fuck in the bushes.
Right.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.120
Well, we can't do that, can we?

15:34.120 --> 15:35.400
Right?
Lionel.

15:38.320 --> 15:43.240
or to who or...how or...

15:43.240 --> 15:45.760
..where or...how many.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.320
It's in the past
and I have no regrets.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.640
But our pact, the pact
we made with each other,

15:53.640 --> 15:55.080
that matters.

living in the white man's world...

16:31.760 --> 16:34.120
I'm not comfortable living
in a white man's world,

16:34.120 --> 16:35.760
but we'll argue about that later.

16:35.760 --> 16:40.360
Right now you're having
a very severe allergic reaction

16:40.360 --> 16:43.640
that you're attributing to
some kind of cultural whitewashing

16:43.640 --> 16:45.280

at racial autonomy.

begins the moment you're broken.

that I can't even...you know.

what you're saying.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.440
You do seem henpecked by Kelly.
Henpecked?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.480
I expect more than racial
stereotyping from you.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.200
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.080
Asian men can be sensitive
without being weak.

Pfft! 20!

17:48.040 --> 17:50.760
When I was 20,
I'd had sex with 69 people.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.880
Purely coincidental number,
by the way.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.040
I wasn't just bi-curious.
I was all the curiouses.

Um...both?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.000
Look, I'm sorry.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.280
Asian men are erased
from the narrative

18:05.280 --> 18:07.560
that centres white ideals
of sexiness.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.560
And?

18:08.560 --> 18:10.880
You're a sexual tyrannosaurus.

some slack.

I'm gonna make it.

Can you hear my confession?

18:32.560 --> 18:34.160

It would be an honour.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.000
And this is just between me and you,
right?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.160
It is. And God.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.760
Forgive me, Lord, for I have sinned.

gonna see the end of the world.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.600
And that's a bad thing?
That's the worst thing!

18:59.600 --> 19:02.400
Kelly, promise me one thing.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.760
Anything.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.840
Forgive Lionel.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.640
Anything but that.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.640
Lionel is a good man.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.360
He's not a perfect man,
but you know in your heart

19:11.360 --> 19:12.840
that he's the perfect man for you.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.600
Oh. I don't think I can.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.200
Kelly. Forgive Lionel.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.480
Forgive him for having a wank.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.320
OK, Guy.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.080
OK.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.360
OK, Kelly, he's gone.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.720
You are a huge arsehole
for getting us lost!

19:44.280 --> 19:46.880
But that was a really nice thing
you did for Lionel and Kelly.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.160
I'm sorry, Charlie.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.480
I thought I could be the chief
of our tribe.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.080
But I'm no good out here,
like I was in my old life.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.640
What were you in your old life?

19:57.640 --> 20:00.200
A really good-looking
vacuum cleaner salesman.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.840
You were a vacuum cleaner salesman?
No!

I'm still a loser.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.400
(LISPS) Yes, I know.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.280
I inherited a sixth sense
from my pop.

A what?
A sixth sense!

21:06.640 --> 21:08.760
You're just Kate Miller-Heidke
in make-up.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.320
Who's Kate Miller-Heidke?

21:10.320 --> 21:12.040
I'm Cat Miller-Heidke!

21:12.040 --> 21:16.440
I'm the Penrith panther! Rarr!

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
Are you definitely a panther?

21:18.440 --> 21:21.960
Could anything
except a panther do this?

21:26.200 --> 21:27.720
Panther!
Argh!

21:27.720 --> 21:30.480
You literally
just said the word 'panther'.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.800
I also have a tail. See?

21:32.800 --> 21:37.520
OK. Ha. So you're, like...a panther.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.880
Are you going to eat me?
No! I'm here to help you, Charlie.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.240
Listen.

# Stood up and took my chances

21:53.800 --> 21:56.760

21:56.760 --> 21:59.480
# Working in a circus
in a dirty town

21:59.480 --> 22:02.000
# Trapped in a cage

poke me with sticks

Kate Miller-Heidke! Charlie!
There you are.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.800
What have you been doing?

23:32.800 --> 23:33.960
Uh, no... Nothing.

23:33.960 --> 23:34.960
What's with the...

23:34.960 --> 23:36.200
Thomas?
Yeah?

23:36.200 --> 23:38.720
I've been having second thoughts
about performing today.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.640
I need to speak to my manager.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.920
Oh, no. Uh, no time.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.760
We are live in five.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.200
And I need you on set
and in costume.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
Costume?

23:48.200 --> 23:50.560
This segment
is gonna go so, so viral.

Let's kick it in the dick!

(CHEERING)

23:53.400 --> 23:56.360
Welcome back to
'Wake Up Australia'.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.520
We're here celebrating
Aussie cultural milestones.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.680
Stop!

24:01.800 --> 24:03.200
I promised my boss,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.080
my...fiance,

24:05.080 --> 24:06.160
that I wouldn't say

24:06.160 --> 24:07.520
anything today,
but...

24:07.520 --> 24:09.640
That's what Australia Day's
all about!

24:09.640 --> 24:11.080
Freedom of speech!

24:11.080 --> 24:12.760
Shut up, Sophie.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.880
I can't stand by as people

24:14.880 --> 24:16.000
yell racial slurs

24:16.000 --> 24:17.360
and celebrate a day

24:17.360 --> 24:18.880
founded on genoc...

(MUZAK VERSION
OF 'WALTZING MATILDA')

24:21.640 --> 24:25.600
..genocide and I'm forced to do
stupid nationalistic bullshit

24:25.600 --> 24:27.360
like wear this giant thong

24:27.360 --> 24:30.400
and stuff burnt sausages
in my mouth.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.880
And for what?

24:31.880 --> 24:33.440
Aussie pride?

24:33.440 --> 24:36.080
SOPHIE: Yes! Aussie pride!
MAN: Boo!

24:36.080 --> 24:37.800
CHARLIE: I said shut up, Sophie!

24:37.800 --> 24:42.360
For four years,
this is all that I've done.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.480
And for what?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.840
After years of trying
to be good enough

24:46.840 --> 24:49.600
for you and this white audience.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.400
And where does it land me?
(BOOING)

24:51.400 --> 24:55.280
You sleeping with Sophie -

24:55.280 --> 24:59.680
my thin, white, beautiful co-host.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.680
That's right,
you pasty motherfuckers. I know!

25:03.680 --> 25:05.720
But guess what -

25:05.720 --> 25:09.400
I kissed Kate Miller-Heidke!

25:09.400 --> 25:11.800
MAN: Ohhh! (LAUGHS)
That's right, I kissed her.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.880
I kissed her on her mouth
and lots of other places!

25:14.880 --> 25:17.400
All over Kate Miller-Heidke!

25:17.400 --> 25:20.480
On your stupid celebration
of colonisation day

25:20.480 --> 25:22.760
that you forced me into!

25:22.760 --> 25:27.080
If you can ruin my day,
I can ruin all of yours too!

25:27.080 --> 25:30.880
(PEOPLE CALL OUT)
It's over, Thomas.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.720
Take the ring.
THOMAS: No...

25:32.720 --> 25:34.800
We're finished!

25:34.800 --> 25:37.840
Charlie, you've got it all wrong.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.400
Oh, yeah? Explain it, then.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.360
We wanted to surprise you!

25:42.360 --> 25:46.280
To show you how much we appreciate
you - how much I appreciate you.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.240
SOPHIE: Surprise!
See?

25:48.240 --> 25:51.840
I just wanted you to like me,
Charlie.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.080
Us feminists have really
gotta stick together

25:54.080 --> 25:56.000
against women
like Kate Miller-Heidke.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Ohh!

25:58.320 --> 26:00.000
You and Thomas...

26:01.840 --> 26:04.320
..you're not sleeping together?
(THOMAS LAUGHS)

26:04.320 --> 26:08.800
No. We're professional,
and I thought you were too.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.760
What the fuck have I done?

26:18.760 --> 26:20.720
What the fuck
have I done?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.200
(BIRDSONG)

26:22.200 --> 26:24.800
What have you done, Smallwood?

26:24.800 --> 26:27.440
Uh...nothing.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
J... Just a dream.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.800
Did you all have
crazy weird dreams too?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.960
No. Just diarrhoea.
(STOMACH RUMBLES)

26:34.960 --> 26:37.320
So much diarrhoea.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.240
I think those mushrooms were bad.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.760
No! Those mushrooms were
a gift from our ancestors.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.480
They were?

26:44.480 --> 26:46.480
And I know just how
to get out of here!

26:48.680 --> 26:50.400
(EXCITING MUSIC)

27:01.520 --> 27:03.600
Swallow the antihistamine, Jayden!

27:03.600 --> 27:07.960
The white man may have given you
allergies, but if you die, he wins!

27:07.960 --> 27:09.000
OK!

27:09.000 --> 27:12.800
I'm taking the 'antiseptamiss'
for all of us.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.640
For my pop.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.440
I love you, Pop!

27:18.800 --> 27:21.000
Pop sounds like a great guy, Jayden.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.520
How is he?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.680
He's dead.
Oh.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.040
He died last year.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.840
How'd he die?

27:29.600 --> 27:32.160
He stopped taking
his diabetes medicine.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.560
Oh.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.720
Come on! (MUTTERS)

27:42.720 --> 27:44.480
I did it! High five.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.040
GUY: Wait! Stop.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.840
I swore I'd walk out of here alive.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.240
(GROANS)

27:49.240 --> 27:51.120
I swore it. I swore!

27:51.120 --> 27:53.720
MONTY: Well done, everyone!

27:53.720 --> 27:56.360
I knew you could do it!

27:59.040 --> 28:00.200
What?

28:00.200 --> 28:04.280
Wait, it was you that was following
us? Not...not the panther?

28:04.280 --> 28:07.080
That gammon beast isn't real!

28:07.080 --> 28:09.480
But I got party pies here.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.880
Alright?
Ooh! Party pies!

28:14.480 --> 28:16.440
Lionel.
Yeah?

28:16.440 --> 28:17.920
I forgive you.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.480
Ohh!

28:19.480 --> 28:21.360
I'm so sorry, Kelly.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.920
Look, if it's any consolation,
I was thinking about you.

28:23.920 --> 28:27.040
I'll give you something to think
about until we're married.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.080
Yeah?
Mmm.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.960
(WHISPERS AND GIGGLES)

28:34.560 --> 28:36.080
He's wrong, Kirby.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.800
I met the panther. Last night.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.200
She's real.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.360
She?

28:47.720 --> 28:49.440
I know what you did, Smallwood.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.600
"Can Charlie ever undo
what she's didgeri-done?"

28:54.600 --> 28:57.000
Are these the telemarketers
you're running from?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.600
We have phone reception again?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.720
(PHONE RINGS)
Ohh!

29:03.400 --> 29:04.440
Oh!

(PHONE SMASHES)

29:08.400 --> 29:09.920
Oh, wow!

29:11.000 --> 29:12.400
That was easy.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.600
It's not that simple to unplug.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.160
Why? Have we got, like, a microchip
in our brain or something?

29:17.160 --> 29:20.480
Probably, but...that's not it.

29:22.240 --> 29:25.040
There's a bounty on your head
from a rival network.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.600
You're a wanted woman, Smallwood.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.480
Oh, God.
