02:56.723 --> 03:00.862
<i>What waits for us</i>

03:09.702 --> 03:15.276
<i>Toplessness, female toplessness, was
declared legal in New York back in 1992,</i>

03:15.576 --> 03:19.146
<i>where the highest court
in the state of New York said...</i>

03:19.246 --> 03:24.729
<i>that where men can be topless, as a matter
of equal protection under the laws,</i>

03:24.829 --> 03:26.654
<i>women can be topless too.</i>

03:27.054 --> 03:29.741
<i>This is a Channel 2 News special report.</i>

03:29.841 --> 03:33.445
<i>To update you on the situation, there has
been a mass shooting at a movie theater</i>

03:33.545 --> 03:36.498
<i>just outside Denver, Colorado, in Aurora.</i>

03:36.598 --> 03:39.709
<i>According to the Aurora Police Department,
a gunman acted alone,</i>

03:39.809 --> 03:42.088
<i>opening fire on audiences
in two movie theaters,</i>

03:42.188 --> 03:45.141
<i>at the premier of Batman:
Dark Knight Returns.</i>

03:45.241 --> 03:47.703
<i>So far, Channel 2 News has confirmed
that there are at least</i>

03:47.803 --> 03:51.521
<i>10 fatalities and 20 injured.
We'll have more information...</i>

04:29.654 --> 04:31.222
Do you have a political agenda?

04:31.322 --> 04:34.276
Today, we were wrongfully arrested,
as the chief of police just admitted,

04:34.376 --> 04:38.407
and we were forced by law to be let go.
So keep your laws off our bodies.

04:41.099 --> 04:44.105
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Let's wrap this up.

04:49.776 --> 04:50.938
Liv?

04:51.038 --> 04:53.447
- Hello. Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry. My name is With.

04:53.547 --> 04:56.383
I write for News Corp, and I was
on Wall Street when you were arrested.

04:56.483 --> 05:00.370
- Yeah, you want to interview me?
- Yes, I think I'd like to do a piece on you.

05:00.470 --> 05:03.190
Well, how 'bout this? Next time,
you join us, and I will grant you

05:03.290 --> 05:06.861
- whatever interview you'd like.
- Me topless? I don't think so.

05:06.961 --> 05:09.764
Why not? Looks like you got
a nice pair under there.

05:09.864 --> 05:12.933
Because I'm a journalist, not an activist.

05:13.033 --> 05:15.403
Do you have to be an activist
to agree that it's bullshit

05:15.503 --> 05:17.738
that a man can walk around shirtless
on a hot summer's day,

05:17.838 --> 05:21.442
- and a woman will get arrested for it?
- I never really thought about it like that.

05:21.542 --> 05:26.548
Well, how 'bout you join us next time, and
I will think about giving you an interview?

05:26.648 --> 05:30.128
How 'bout you give me an interview
and I'll think about joining you?

05:30.986 --> 05:33.923
- I will win this game.
- No, you won't.

05:34.023 --> 05:36.593
Yes, I will.

05:48.805 --> 05:51.441
Oh, good. You're home.

05:51.841 --> 05:54.477
I need two rent checks,

05:54.577 --> 05:58.015
because right now, they're on the verge
of shutting off our cable,

05:58.115 --> 06:01.824
which means no internet, no email, no HBO,

06:01.924 --> 06:03.855
no connection
to the outside world whatsoever.

06:03.955 --> 06:06.524
I don't get paid till Friday,
and I have, like, $88. to my name.

06:06.624 --> 06:09.043
Can you please pirate
the Wi-Fi from next door?

06:09.293 --> 06:11.764
I have to finish this, and I will... yeah.

06:11.864 --> 06:14.460
- You want me to pirate the Wi-Fi?
- Yeah.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.334
- From next door?
- Yeah.

06:16.434 --> 06:18.481
- Maybe you could get a second job?
- A job?

06:18.581 --> 06:20.505
- Yeah.
- Really? Like what?

06:20.905 --> 06:24.576
Waitressing. Hosting,
bartending, stripping.

06:24.676 --> 06:28.781
- Stripping is a respectable... it's...
- First of all, there's thousands of people

06:28.881 --> 06:32.335
in line for every job in the city,
and secondly, concerning the pole,

06:32.435 --> 06:34.637
I can't even get naked in front
of people I'm attracted to,

06:34.737 --> 06:38.073
let alone random humans
throwing bills at me.

06:38.173 --> 06:39.943
I'm not the enemy here...

06:40.043 --> 06:42.845
- I'm not mad at you, I'm just... I'm done.
- I feel like you are mad at me.

06:42.945 --> 06:46.016
'Cause you're not using your indoor voice,
and now you're saying, "I'm done, I'm done,"

06:46.116 --> 06:48.011
and walking away to the couch.

06:49.286 --> 06:52.789
You can storm off and dramatically
sit on the other side of the room.

06:52.889 --> 06:54.658
That's fine. I'll match you on this.

06:54.758 --> 06:58.489
I'll just stare you down
until you give me your money.

07:00.732 --> 07:05.637
If I don't sell this story, I promise,
I'm gonna sell my eggs, my plasma,

07:05.737 --> 07:07.973
- my blood... whatever it takes.
- Yeah.

07:08.073 --> 07:10.907
I'm gonna get you the money, okay?

07:13.911 --> 07:15.680
All right. So...

07:15.780 --> 07:19.451
I just... I just want to get some face...
basic facts out of the way.

07:19.551 --> 07:23.189
- Okay. Bring it on, reporter girl.
- Please say your name and age.

07:23.289 --> 07:25.558
- Liv. 23 years young.
- Where are you from?

07:25.658 --> 07:28.394
Chicago, but I've been here
since I was 17.

07:28.494 --> 07:29.862
Where do you live?

07:29.962 --> 07:32.865
Right now I'm squatting
in a basement in Red Hook.

07:32.965 --> 07:35.068
And what do your parents do?

07:35.168 --> 07:40.161
- They are professional hippies.
- And do you have a job?

07:40.261 --> 07:43.870
I volunteer at this website called
"Magic Transistor." It's really cool.

07:44.378 --> 07:46.813
- Are you married?
- Are you hitting on me?

07:46.913 --> 07:50.885
No! No. I'm just trying to get,
you know, the full picture.

07:50.985 --> 07:54.655
What is your goal in going topless
in public places?

07:54.755 --> 07:58.192
- To expose the double standard.
- Can you explain to me the double standard?

07:58.292 --> 08:01.195
Absolutely.
What I can't get my head around

08:01.295 --> 08:03.964
is that the nipple is the first thing
we see when we're born.

08:04.064 --> 08:07.603
It nourishes us, and then somehow,
the symbol of life becomes illegal.

08:07.703 --> 08:10.739
I mean, my own mother was kicked out
of church for breastfeeding me.

08:10.839 --> 08:13.475
And what's even more annoying
is that, while we're allowed

08:13.575 --> 08:16.478
to see murder, violence,
and war on every channel,

08:16.578 --> 08:20.249
Janet Jackson's nipple slips and it becomes
the fucking crime of the century.

08:20.449 --> 08:23.286
Furthermore, I'm trying to bring about

08:23.386 --> 08:26.156
more responsible representations
of female nudity,

08:26.256 --> 08:29.092
because the only representations
that I see in mainstream culture

08:29.192 --> 08:31.494
are ones that are totally hypersexualized

08:31.594 --> 08:34.597
and ones that make me question

08:34.697 --> 08:39.160
what it means to be a woman
in modern society.

08:41.038 --> 08:43.807
How many times have you been arrested?

08:43.907 --> 08:46.243
No comment.

08:46.543 --> 08:50.514
Why do you think you keep getting arrested
for something that's legal in New York?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.883
Because cops are morons.

08:52.983 --> 08:55.444
So why do you keep doing it?

08:56.288 --> 08:58.623
It makes me feel good.

08:58.723 --> 09:01.347
Why don't you get a lawyer next time?

09:01.447 --> 09:02.660
I've thought about it.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.297
Maybe you can be in charge of that,
since you've promised to join us next time.

09:06.397 --> 09:09.470
- I did?
- You did.

09:10.535 --> 09:12.471
What if I don't?

09:12.571 --> 09:15.233
I will deny everything in this interview.

09:16.942 --> 09:22.081
I should not have to use
an NFL halftime show

09:22.181 --> 09:27.114
as a negative example
to teach my children.

09:29.756 --> 09:33.460
Allowing tasteless Super Bowl programming

09:33.560 --> 09:37.559
is a nationwide entertainment
industry standard.

09:50.445 --> 09:53.281
I even had a photograph
of 50 men and women's heads,

09:53.381 --> 09:55.282
and then one woman's breast was showing.

09:55.382 --> 09:58.119
They had a problem with it, and I said,
"Why don't you just blur it out?"

09:58.219 --> 10:00.638
And they said, "Oh, we don't censor
at The New York Times."

10:00.738 --> 10:02.908
Right, and there were, you know,
there were young children.

10:03.008 --> 10:06.028
- There was a six-year-old.
- What is the problem with people?

10:06.128 --> 10:10.599
And I know that's not the main issue here.
The six-year-old girl who died, okay?

10:10.699 --> 10:14.103
She died because she was, unfortunately,
in the same spot as a lunatic.

10:14.203 --> 10:15.871
But she would have been at home, asleep.

10:15.971 --> 10:17.874
At home asleep,
at home playing board games...

10:17.974 --> 10:20.343
it's not about what time it was
or where she was at.

10:20.443 --> 10:22.738
Batman is a scary movie.

10:58.483 --> 11:02.554
If you're in this to change the world,
you're in the wrong business.

11:02.654 --> 11:06.743
We have a dozen interns who can write
more palatable stories for college credit

11:06.843 --> 11:09.896
and who would love to have your job.

11:09.996 --> 11:15.067
In fact, clear out your desk.
You're just not working out here.

11:59.949 --> 12:01.884
Liv, it's With. Call me back.

12:01.984 --> 12:05.112
I'm on my way to you right now.
Are you there?

12:11.126 --> 12:14.494
Liv, it's With. Call me back.
I'm on my way to you right now.

12:15.365 --> 12:16.600
Hey.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.636
I've been texting you for hours.
Did you lose your phone again?

12:19.736 --> 12:23.837
No, I live in a bomb shelter
and have 1/8 of a bar of reception.

12:27.344 --> 12:30.177
What? Okay, you're freaking me out.

12:30.277 --> 12:33.344
Was there a terrorist attack?
Should we flee?

12:34.685 --> 12:37.622
I couldn't sell the story.

12:37.722 --> 12:40.892
I called and I pleaded
and I begged everyone I knew.

12:40.992 --> 12:44.762
- Who's everyone?
- Post, The Times, Interview.

12:44.862 --> 12:48.267
So none of the paparazzi
that were there...

12:48.367 --> 12:51.136
- none of them printed anything.
- No.

12:51.236 --> 12:55.037
- Not even a blog?
- I tried.

13:00.111 --> 13:03.604
Liv, I think if you want to impact
mass culture in America,

13:03.704 --> 13:05.768
you need to take this to the next level.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.674
I think you need to go really big.
National publicity stunts.

13:08.774 --> 13:12.325
Viral campaigns.
Armies of women in every single city.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.827
I think you need to make so much noise

13:14.927 --> 13:17.698
that these policy-makers have
no other choice but to listen.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.034
With, I can't afford
to eat at a restaurant.

13:20.134 --> 13:22.036
Where am I gonna get
the cash for a revolution?

13:22.136 --> 13:23.971
We'll find the money.
We'll start a nonprofit.

13:24.071 --> 13:27.334
- We're gonna make it work.
- We?

13:28.942 --> 13:31.145
What do you mean, "we"?
What are you saying, Snow White?

13:31.245 --> 13:34.916
I'm saying...
I just lost my job over this article,

13:35.016 --> 13:38.086
I'm about to get evicted,
and I have nothing left to lose.

13:38.686 --> 13:42.488
You honestly believe that we can
change the laws in this country?

13:42.957 --> 13:44.517
Yeah.

13:55.304 --> 13:57.301
Orson!

13:57.406 --> 13:59.339
Orson!

14:02.545 --> 14:04.581
Orson!

14:09.386 --> 14:11.355
Orson!

14:11.955 --> 14:15.192
- What's that on your head?
- A check for fucking $5,000.

14:15.292 --> 14:17.127
Why'd you put it on your head?
That's a dumb place to put a check.

14:17.227 --> 14:20.961
- Yeah, let's go pig out, like, now.
- Okay. Yeah. I'm down.

14:21.298 --> 14:25.564
How much of that did you see?
Like, all of it, or just the end part?

14:53.866 --> 14:56.436
Do you honestly believe that we can
change the laws in this country?

14:56.536 --> 14:59.939
Do you want to hear a quote that sums up
my entire theory of life?

15:00.039 --> 15:01.174
Okay.

15:01.274 --> 15:04.911
"First they ignore you,
then they laugh at you,

15:05.011 --> 15:07.781
"then they fight you, and then you win."

15:08.181 --> 15:10.940
- Who said that?
- Mahatma Gandhi.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.524
- It's very optimistic.
- Yeah.

15:16.824 --> 15:20.453
<i>We got money...</i>

15:39.914 --> 15:43.133
I mean, money isn't really real.
If you think about it, it's like...

15:43.233 --> 15:46.856
pretty colored paper and lots
of numbers in a computer.

15:47.256 --> 15:49.826
That's the single dumbest
thing you've ever said.

15:49.926 --> 15:52.061
- Money is 100% real.
- Well.

15:52.161 --> 15:55.064
- It's the realest thing I know.
- This is real.

15:55.164 --> 15:58.968
That's for me? You are such a good friend.

15:59.068 --> 16:01.939
For rent and cable and 500 for all
the takeout you've been buying.

16:02.239 --> 16:06.075
- I'm not gonna take money for takeout.
- Why aren't you gonna take money for takeout?

16:06.175 --> 16:09.113
Because that's just me
as a friend buying you lunch.

16:09.213 --> 16:12.049
- Just take it.
- I'm not... no. Because no.

16:12.749 --> 16:14.818
Just receive.

16:14.918 --> 16:19.017
Fine. Okay. I'm not happy about it,
and I'll hold this against you.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.559
Oh, Jim Black.

16:21.659 --> 16:25.096
Jim Black? Who's that?
Inquiring minds want to know.

16:25.196 --> 16:29.067
Yeah, yeah. This DC PR guy that I worked
with at the paper finally texted me back.

16:29.167 --> 16:32.804
DC PR guy? What do you mean
you're texting a DC PR guy?

16:32.904 --> 16:37.710
I am starting...
a full-scale culture revolution.

16:37.810 --> 16:39.779
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

16:39.879 --> 16:41.786
- And I need help.
- I...

16:41.886 --> 16:46.472
And listen before you...
and it involves a lot of women.

16:46.952 --> 16:49.389
- I might be able to make time.
- Look at...

16:49.489 --> 16:52.475
How single are... most of them?

16:58.798 --> 17:01.888
So, remember when you said we should
get a lawyer to come with you

17:01.988 --> 17:04.471
- to your next topless protest?
- Yeah, that was your idea.

17:04.570 --> 17:07.675
Well, I looked into it, and these lawyers
who specialize in freedom of speech

17:07.775 --> 17:10.578
have agreed to represent us
in New York and nationwide.

17:10.678 --> 17:14.249
Oh, my God! Freeing nipples
state by state. Amazing.

17:14.348 --> 17:15.717
One by one.

17:16.217 --> 17:18.286
So are you gonna do it too?

17:18.386 --> 17:20.421
- What?
- Go topless.

17:20.521 --> 17:22.223
Oh, my God.

17:22.323 --> 17:25.928
Sure. Maybe. Maybe. If I'm surrounded by
other women, but that's not the point, Liv!

17:26.028 --> 17:28.430
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry.
So how much is this gonna cost us?

17:28.530 --> 17:31.900
$3,000. to put them on retainer,
which is a deal... believe me.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.570
But where are we gonna get that money?

17:34.670 --> 17:36.466
Ta-da!

17:38.540 --> 17:40.108
What is that?

17:40.208 --> 17:43.796
Severance check from the paper. $5,000.

17:43.913 --> 17:46.870
Consider me your first investor.

17:56.392 --> 18:00.153
- Thank you, With.
- You're welcome.

18:06.169 --> 18:10.291
Do you have any issues
with being topless in public places?

18:11.575 --> 18:16.081
I made a resolution this year
to try more new, scary things, so...

18:16.181 --> 18:18.984
that sounds really scary. Yeah.

18:19.084 --> 18:22.454
It says that you have special skills.

18:22.554 --> 18:27.893
Yeah. I know Final Cut, Excel, Photoshop,

18:27.993 --> 18:30.764
Java, Drupal.

18:31.514 --> 18:33.716
And my grandmother was a Black Panther.

18:33.816 --> 18:37.136
- That's so cool.
- I read Malcolm X.

18:37.236 --> 18:41.574
The description says campaign experience,

18:41.674 --> 18:45.044
film and editing skills wanted...

18:45.144 --> 18:48.502
must be comfortable with public nudity.

18:50.877 --> 18:53.520
- Can I be arrested?
- Yeah.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.856
Where do you stand on pasties?

18:55.956 --> 18:59.760
Do you have any objections to your going
undercover inside government organizations

18:59.860 --> 19:02.163
to free this country
from oppression and censorship?

19:02.863 --> 19:04.232
Fuck, yeah.

19:04.332 --> 19:07.988
Do you have any issues
getting topless in public places?

19:10.137 --> 19:12.273
- Thank you. That's great.
- Thank you.

19:13.606 --> 19:16.133
You guys are both filmmakers?

19:17.178 --> 19:18.446
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:18.546 --> 19:21.383
I didn't know you guys didn't speak English,
but that's great that you are here.

19:21.483 --> 19:25.371
I mean, I guess I would have
to tell my husband about it.

19:25.471 --> 19:27.925
- My tits are in.
- I'm free tomorrow.

19:30.325 --> 19:32.410
That's great.

19:32.895 --> 19:33.917
All right.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.765
What's going on? Are we fucked?

21:11.365 --> 21:12.768
It's working.

21:12.868 --> 21:14.804
- Officers, excuse me.
- What's going on here?

21:14.904 --> 21:19.241
These women are my clients, and we have
legal permits for this demonstration.

21:19.341 --> 21:22.911
Now, according to statute 245.01,

21:23.011 --> 21:27.350
the Court of Appeals of New York has ruled
that the exposure of a bare female breast

21:27.450 --> 21:29.585
violates no exposure laws.

21:30.185 --> 21:34.307
And so on behalf of my clients,
for violation of this statute,

21:34.857 --> 21:37.494
I'm officially issuing you a lawsuit.

21:37.594 --> 21:43.060
For their wrongful arrest on Wall Street,
September the 15th of 2012.

22:03.889 --> 22:06.358
Suing them for ten million?

22:06.458 --> 22:09.428
I mean, it was just a PR stunt.
It'll probably get thrown out.

22:09.528 --> 22:13.665
Our lawyers thought it would...
it would lure the press into covering it.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.868
- Should've called me.
- What do you mean?

22:15.968 --> 22:18.570
Well, you know I would've
leaked it to Reuters.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.943
In seconds, you could've been out
to 150 countries in 60 languages.

22:23.043 --> 22:26.913
I think you are tapping into
the first, and probably most...

22:27.013 --> 22:29.616
important amendment to the constitution:

22:29.716 --> 22:33.453
Freedom of religion, freedom
of speech, press, assembly.

22:33.553 --> 22:38.159
Do you know that we are 37th
in the press freedom index?

22:38.259 --> 22:43.164
There are 36 other countries that have
a freer press than we do. 36.

22:43.364 --> 22:45.232
Who's the worst? North Korea?

22:45.332 --> 22:49.829
Eritrea. It's a little tiny country
in East Africa near the Red Sea.

22:50.404 --> 22:54.208
Jim. I know that you're...
that you're crazy busy,

22:54.308 --> 22:58.313
but we need somebody who knows this world,
somebody that can help us connect the dots.

22:58.413 --> 23:01.416
We need a consigliere, a Yoda.

23:01.816 --> 23:06.028
A Yoda? Big shoes to fill.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.469
Yeah.

23:07.569 --> 23:12.511
I just don't know how this is
gonna sit in the big, bad world.

23:13.062 --> 23:14.663
Yeah.

23:14.763 --> 23:16.766
How's the paper?

23:17.442 --> 23:20.903
- I'm done working for dinosaurs.
- You quit.

23:21.003 --> 23:22.738
No, I got fired.

23:25.509 --> 23:27.533
Fuck 'em.

23:29.012 --> 23:31.815
Okay, With... here's what I can do...

23:32.015 --> 23:33.617
Let me percolate on it.

23:33.717 --> 23:38.239
If... if something sifts to the top,
I'll give you a buzz. Okay?

23:53.738 --> 23:56.441
- He's percolating.
- Define percolating.

23:56.541 --> 23:59.678
I mean, his schedule's nuts,
but he's gonna make it work.

23:59.778 --> 24:02.615
- Oh, my God. This is huge.
- Yeah.

24:02.715 --> 24:03.949
What are you coloring?

24:04.049 --> 24:06.752
I'm color-coding the states
that women can legally be topless in.

24:06.852 --> 24:11.557
How many states in America
is the nipple actually legal?

24:11.657 --> 24:13.242
12.

24:13.993 --> 24:17.897
- All right, nips. This is our hit list.
- What am I looking at?

24:17.997 --> 24:22.602
Well, it's a list of 32 good and bad guys
that we're targeting as of now.

24:22.702 --> 24:25.438
Madonna? Lady Gaga?

24:25.738 --> 24:27.941
- Katie Couric?
- For a campaign of this magnitude,

24:28.041 --> 24:31.846
we're gonna need to form a coalition
of like-minded organizations

24:31.946 --> 24:35.783
and reach out to high-profile people
who will champion our cause in the media.

24:35.883 --> 24:39.821
How do you expect us to just reach out
to these huge, iconic names?

24:39.921 --> 24:42.680
Easy, we just call their handlers,
their humans, and say,

24:42.780 --> 24:46.194
"Hey, we are on the front lines
fighting for your freedom.

24:46.294 --> 24:48.513
"You don't want to give us
ten minutes of your client's time?"

24:48.613 --> 24:50.482
Then let karma fall where it may.

24:50.632 --> 24:53.669
That's a really nice theory,
but back here on Earth...

24:53.769 --> 24:56.205
what makes you think these people
are even gonna talk to us?

24:56.305 --> 24:59.508
Cali, everyone in the world
is hungry for something real.

24:59.608 --> 25:02.511
- Our currency is meaning.
- You're joking, right?

25:02.711 --> 25:07.167
No, I'm not joking. I mean, even icons...
icons who have everything in the world

25:07.267 --> 25:10.086
at the end of the day, they realize
all they have is themselves.

25:10.186 --> 25:13.823
They want meaning in their lives.
It's the only thing that they can't buy,

25:13.923 --> 25:15.992
but we can give it to them.

25:16.092 --> 25:18.534
- Hey, we have that meeting.
- What meeting?

25:18.994 --> 25:21.487
That meeting with the investors.

25:21.587 --> 25:25.255
Oh, with the investor. Yeah.
Okay, great. So I'll see you guys later.

25:27.037 --> 25:28.072
See you guys.

25:28.172 --> 25:31.083
What do you think?
Maybe I'll take, like...

25:32.743 --> 25:35.546
- That girl is a button-pusher.
- It's not her. It's her programming.

25:35.646 --> 25:38.250
- She just needs a new operating system.
- She's a contradictarian.

25:38.350 --> 25:39.751
She's working her ass off for free.

25:39.851 --> 25:42.820
Whatev, she can not be talking to us
like that in front of the peeps.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.431
- Rooftop?
- Rooftop. Let's go.

26:05.911 --> 26:08.749
A dream you dream alone is only a dream.

26:08.849 --> 26:12.319
A dream you dream together is a reality.

26:12.419 --> 26:16.576
- Did you just make that up?
- Nah, it's John Lennon.

26:17.224 --> 26:21.561
You realize you quote some genius
at least twice a day.

26:21.661 --> 26:24.398
Sorry. I just love quotes.
I love their timelessness.

26:24.498 --> 26:27.569
I love how they can lift
people's minds, you know?

26:27.669 --> 26:30.238
So we're not firing her.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.473
No.

26:44.152 --> 26:47.323
- Why are you still wearing a bra?
- I don't know. Someone might see.

26:47.423 --> 26:51.627
- Who cares if people see? That's the point.
- Whatever. Just stay there.

26:52.127 --> 26:56.251
With, isn't the point that people see?

27:00.069 --> 27:01.859
I...

27:02.238 --> 27:04.659
That speaks volumes.

27:05.608 --> 27:08.866
Drop the bra. Free your mind.

27:11.748 --> 27:13.433
- Drop the bra.
- Just like that?

27:13.533 --> 27:17.147
- Just like that.
- All right. All right.

27:36.741 --> 27:38.677
You know I appreciate your optimism, but,

27:38.777 --> 27:41.803
you do realize that societies
and religions have been...

27:41.903 --> 27:43.638
oppressing women for countless millennia.

27:43.738 --> 27:46.687
This is not going to change overnight.
I hope you know that.

27:46.787 --> 27:50.089
Yeah, but you know what, you have
to remember that humans and animals

27:50.189 --> 27:53.092
and even bugs at a deep DNA level,
they want to be free.

27:53.192 --> 27:56.144
I'm just merely curious
as to why you think

27:56.244 --> 27:59.847
that you... we can change something that
has never been able to have been changed

27:59.947 --> 28:02.902
in the history of ever. Why us?
Why now? What makes us so unique?

28:03.002 --> 28:05.225
We live in a technological age
of social media,

28:05.325 --> 28:07.775
where one idea can reach
more people in one week

28:07.875 --> 28:10.844
than Jesus, Buddha, or Moses
could reach in over thousands of years.

28:10.944 --> 28:14.081
Let's be careful comparing ourselves
to Buddha and Jesus, okay?

28:14.181 --> 28:15.349
Besides, that's all relative.

28:15.449 --> 28:18.469
There are way more people on this Earth
now than there were 5,000 years ago.

28:18.569 --> 28:20.889
But at the rate you can reach people
overnight is in the millions.

28:20.989 --> 28:24.359
Look what happened in Egypt. That started
with one guy and one Facebook page.

28:24.459 --> 28:28.029
I'm not sure how accurate
that statement is, but listen...

28:28.129 --> 28:29.931
In political movements especially,

28:30.031 --> 28:33.401
the lines between delusion and reality
can become very blurry.

28:33.501 --> 28:38.440
So how about I will stay realistic,
and you two stay optimistic,

28:38.540 --> 28:40.543
and we meet somewhere in the middle.

28:40.643 --> 28:43.234
I fucking love this ice cream.

28:44.179 --> 28:47.082
I think the poster should look like
a piece of Elle's street art.

28:47.182 --> 28:50.035
- Yes.
- I think I know someone who knows her.

28:50.135 --> 28:53.284
Want any text on the poster? Tagline?

28:55.125 --> 28:58.995
- Free the Nipple.
- Right. Free the Nipple it is then.

28:59.095 --> 29:00.815
Yeah!

29:02.666 --> 29:05.535
Dude, we seriously need a bigger place
to work. I mean, one bathroom?

29:05.635 --> 29:08.238
There's no workspaces.
It's like a mini Big Brother in here.

29:08.338 --> 29:11.346
I know, you're preaching to the choir. But
what do you want me to do? Work outside?

29:11.446 --> 29:14.172
You want to work on the roof... what?

29:16.347 --> 29:18.917
All right, you guys.
It's still under construction, but...

29:19.017 --> 29:21.460
we needed a bigger space, so...

29:36.301 --> 29:38.743
Oh, my God.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.906
What do you guys think?

29:41.006 --> 29:45.445
Things aren't really together yet, but we
have it for free for as long as we want.

29:45.545 --> 29:48.781
What? Too rustic?

29:48.881 --> 29:52.318
- When can we move in?
- Now.

29:52.418 --> 29:55.388
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.719
We're inside a pool.

30:24.819 --> 30:26.855
The first film I make here

30:26.955 --> 30:31.360
was word-for-word, scene-by-scene
remake of a film I do in Europe.

30:31.460 --> 30:35.731
But after we lock picture, MPAA destroy.

30:35.831 --> 30:39.101
They take out nudity, drug...

30:39.201 --> 30:41.237
you know, anything that was "too real."

30:41.337 --> 30:45.675
- But why did you let them do that?
- You get NC 17 is like pornography, right?

30:45.775 --> 30:50.147
You know, theaters don't release,
no DVD, no Walmart.

30:50.247 --> 30:54.151
I mean, honestly, I feel like we're in
a fucking Communist country right now.

30:54.251 --> 30:57.020
You're not, but, you know, growing up,

30:57.120 --> 31:00.857
you all the time hear America's
home of the free,

31:00.957 --> 31:04.429
but after I work here, I think
it's more repressed than I imagined.

31:04.529 --> 31:08.766
- Excuse me, but we're ready for you.
- Yes, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

31:08.866 --> 31:12.870
Burt sends me video. Very good.
I like. So you need money?

31:12.970 --> 31:16.107
Oh... yeah. Money would be great.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.564
How much you need
and what you need this for?

31:23.249 --> 31:27.400
Here's what you're up against. In 1980...

31:27.500 --> 31:31.390
religious organizations mobilized
and put Reagan in the White House.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.587
Basically, from that moment,

31:33.687 --> 31:37.608
the Republicans made an alliance
with the Christian right,

31:37.708 --> 31:42.402
and when puritans start manipulating
politicians and hijacking government,

31:42.502 --> 31:45.238
that's when censorship laws get weird.

31:45.338 --> 31:51.811
Here's how it works: Let's say
there is a television show like Skins,

31:51.911 --> 31:54.215
where you have teenagers having sex,

31:54.315 --> 31:57.218
- ingesting drugs, etcetera, etcetera.
- I like that show.

31:57.318 --> 32:00.321
Here's why it's no longer on in the U.S.:

32:00.421 --> 32:04.392
Groups like the PTC
rally their religious base,

32:04.492 --> 32:07.728
to send e-mails and phone calls
to DC, to the FCC,

32:07.828 --> 32:11.666
to the press, to the networks,
and, in Skins' case, MTV.

32:11.766 --> 32:13.936
The sponsors freak out.

32:14.036 --> 32:16.605
They pull their ads. MTV freaks out.

32:16.705 --> 32:18.707
No more money?

32:18.807 --> 32:21.332
Puritanical ideology...

32:21.432 --> 32:23.679
meet commerce. Show's off the air.

32:23.779 --> 32:27.083
But Jim, how do we go up against
these huge Goliath institutions?

32:27.183 --> 32:30.219
I mean, I just feel that we're
slightly out-gunned here.

32:30.319 --> 32:35.892
Okay, first thing you have to
understand is this is not about fighting.

32:35.992 --> 32:38.394
I'm pretty sure she meant metaphorically.

32:38.794 --> 32:43.601
Metaphorically, literally, you got
to forget about this idea of fighting.

32:43.701 --> 32:46.537
Whatever you fight grows stronger.

32:46.637 --> 32:47.966
That's very Zen of you,

32:48.066 --> 32:52.234
but I'm asking how do we change
the censorship laws in America?

32:53.143 --> 32:55.345
This is not about politics.

32:55.445 --> 32:59.517
This is about the hearts
and minds of the people.

32:59.717 --> 33:03.822
You want to shake things up? Take
a page out of the Christian right's book.

33:03.922 --> 33:08.126
Use the same tactics
they employ on your cause.

33:08.226 --> 33:13.464
We're a product of this puritanical
culture, but let me ask you this...

33:13.564 --> 33:15.768
who do you think runs the world?

33:15.868 --> 33:18.370
- The 1%?
- No.

33:18.470 --> 33:20.372
The Illuminati?

33:20.472 --> 33:24.110
No. You do.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.045
The people.

33:26.145 --> 33:31.585
When the masses align, Rome falls,
Egypt falls, it all falls down.

33:31.685 --> 33:35.856
- In theory, but...
- No, not in theory. In real time.

33:35.956 --> 33:38.659
What do you think all those
little religious groups

33:38.759 --> 33:41.762
across the great unwashed are made of?

33:41.862 --> 33:44.391
A bunch of people.

33:48.903 --> 33:53.140
What you need is
a state-of-the-art campaign

33:53.240 --> 33:56.444
that will be the butterfly wing
that will trigger the tsunami

33:56.544 --> 33:58.613
of signatures to petitions.

33:58.713 --> 34:02.917
You drive to Washington via social media.

34:03.017 --> 34:06.721
When you reach your critical mass,
I'll take care of the press.

34:06.821 --> 34:09.525
CNN, Fox, BBC.

34:09.625 --> 34:11.851
I'll make a few phone calls, and suddenly,

34:11.952 --> 34:17.666
the great media monster's eyes
will turn toward you...

34:17.766 --> 34:19.967
for 15 minutes.

34:20.068 --> 34:22.360
Maybe 15 seconds.

34:23.473 --> 34:25.945
In that moment...

34:26.476 --> 34:29.097
What are you gonna say?

34:30.545 --> 34:33.117
We researched the name "Topless Warriors,"
and it's already been taken

34:33.217 --> 34:37.922
- by some group in Russia.
- What? Are you fucking my tits?

34:38.022 --> 34:39.757
- Orson!
- Hey. What's up?

34:39.857 --> 34:42.126
Talk to me. Who are these girls?

34:42.226 --> 34:45.666
These are Femen. According to this site,
they have over 300 members.

34:45.766 --> 34:49.250
And they protested issues ranging
from the plight of the Ukrainian prostitute

34:49.400 --> 34:52.737
- to the election of President Putin.
- These humans are hardcore.

34:52.837 --> 34:54.922
- How did they get so much press?
- They're smart.

34:55.023 --> 34:58.106
They target high-profile, international
events like Davos and elections.

34:58.206 --> 34:59.911
They hit the Vatican.

35:00.012 --> 35:01.379
- We need to do that.
- What?

35:01.479 --> 35:04.883
Storm high-profile landmarks
with thousands of topless women.

35:04.983 --> 35:08.086
- What's equivalent to the Vatican in America?
- St. Patrick's Cathedral?

35:08.186 --> 35:11.324
- Probably the White House, right?
- Yes! We need to invade DC.

35:11.424 --> 35:15.795
- With, can I talk to you just for a second?
- Yeah. We're gonna go get some food.

35:15.895 --> 35:18.797
- Would you guys want anything?
- Yeah. Could you grab some Dunkaroos?

35:18.897 --> 35:22.001
- Dunkaroos? What's that?
- It's the cookie with the kangaroo.

35:22.101 --> 35:25.637
They're shaped in a kangaroo,
and you drop them into the...

35:26.640 --> 35:29.135
It's like the little...

35:30.744 --> 35:32.713
- I know what they are. Come on.
- Okay.

35:32.813 --> 35:34.615
Get whatever varieties they have.

35:34.715 --> 35:38.525
- Chocolate and vanilla.
- And some string cheese.

35:39.152 --> 35:43.143
We should try to get in touch with that
porn star that's in parliament too.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.102
What's up?

35:54.202 --> 35:56.963
- Nothing.
- Come on.

35:58.139 --> 36:00.810
- Well, we have a problem.
- Yeah.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.978
- Roz, tell her.
- What is it?

36:03.078 --> 36:07.683
I ran the numbers and the invoices
and the receipts, and as of now,

36:07.783 --> 36:10.000
we're down to $397.21.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.420
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
we're down to $397.21.

36:11.420 --> 36:11.520
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:11.520 --> 36:15.091
And, girls, if we're seriously planning
on producing a campaign
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:15.091 --> 36:15.191
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:15.191 --> 36:18.394
with thousands of women in DC,
we're gonna need real money,
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:18.394 --> 36:18.494
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:18.494 --> 36:21.164
or this whole thing
is going to fall apart.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:21.164 --> 36:21.264
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:21.264 --> 36:22.000
Okay, the universe is not going
to fall apart, Chicken Little.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:24.367
Okay, the universe is not going
to fall apart, Chicken Little.

36:24.467 --> 36:25.803
The universe has a plan.

36:25.903 --> 36:31.307
In quantum physics, they have proven
that space and time are illusions.

36:31.407 --> 36:34.145
So if time doesn't really exist,

36:34.245 --> 36:37.849
then the impact that we are going
to make... we've already made...

36:37.949 --> 36:40.351
and everything that we are going to do,
we've already done.

36:40.451 --> 36:42.887
Liv, I don't need
the Carl Sagan explanation.

36:42.987 --> 36:45.756
All I need to know is do we have money?

36:45.856 --> 36:49.715
Because, like, the wall... we're at it.

36:54.098 --> 36:55.634
I...

36:55.734 --> 37:00.062
I have to start looking for a job.
Seriously, I'm not even kidding anymore.

37:00.639 --> 37:03.608
We're in the middle of a revolution.
You can't get a job.

37:03.708 --> 37:06.746
I have to pay rent in four days,
and my phone's about to get cut off.

37:06.846 --> 37:10.650
With, you cannot afford the luxury
of a negative thought right now.

37:10.750 --> 37:14.142
We're out of money, and we need a plan.

37:15.955 --> 37:20.493
- Well, Cali had an idea, but, well...
- But what?

37:20.993 --> 37:24.351
All right, well, you know those websites
where you can upload a video to get people

37:24.451 --> 37:26.611
- to care about your cause...
- Yeah, like Kickstarter.

37:26.711 --> 37:30.637
Yeah, exactly. Well, we could make
a viral video right now if we wanted to.

37:30.737 --> 37:34.393
- We've got iPhones.
- And shoot what?

37:36.543 --> 37:38.669
All right. Heads...

37:38.769 --> 37:41.049
I run topless through
Times Square and you film.

37:41.149 --> 37:44.664
Tails, you run topless through
Times Square and I film you.

37:44.764 --> 37:46.543
No!

37:47.322 --> 37:50.125
I mean, in front of you is one thing,
but in front of complete strangers?

37:50.225 --> 37:53.178
That's in my top ten worst fears ever,
right next to being buried alive.

37:53.278 --> 37:55.230
No.

37:55.330 --> 37:57.866
- No what?
- No.

37:57.966 --> 38:01.720
You know, you can't be halfway pregnant.
You can't be half-committed, either.

38:02.670 --> 38:04.699
What's it gonna be? Yes or no?

38:09.077 --> 38:12.765
All right. Flip the fucking coin!

38:29.968 --> 38:34.305
<i>Free the nipple if you dare to</i>

38:34.405 --> 38:38.409
<i>Life is all too short</i>

38:38.509 --> 38:43.014
<i>You got to run the gauntlet, baby</i>

38:43.114 --> 38:47.319
<i>You know that you should</i>

38:47.419 --> 38:49.354
<i>Free the nipple</i>

38:49.454 --> 38:56.027
<i>Everyone who leaves an open door</i>

38:56.127 --> 39:00.266
<i>They are free to lead you into</i>

39:00.366 --> 39:04.938
<i>A better universe</i>

39:21.555 --> 39:24.278
<i>Let me go home</i>

39:30.131 --> 39:32.301
This is the best bet ever.
Now I don't give a fuck.

39:32.401 --> 39:35.670
You don't give a fuck? You don't give...
now I don't give a fuck. Whateva.

39:35.770 --> 39:38.869
<i>Let me go home</i>

39:40.609 --> 39:42.620
<i>Yeah</i>

39:44.746 --> 39:48.784
<i>Don't let me be the last</i>

39:48.884 --> 39:51.836
<i>To let it go</i>

39:53.159 --> 39:56.218
<i>Let me go home</i>

39:57.993 --> 40:00.281
<i>Yeah</i>

40:02.131 --> 40:06.203
<i>Don't let me be the last</i>

40:06.303 --> 40:09.401
<i>To let it go</i>

40:17.848 --> 40:19.950
Right there! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

40:20.050 --> 40:22.035
Hey, hey, hey!

40:26.391 --> 40:29.077
Run, run, run! Go!

40:29.177 --> 40:31.862
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Come on.

40:31.962 --> 40:34.815
Hey, hey. Hey.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.602
I don't know what she's doing.
She's not answering her phone.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.471
I don't know.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.240
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

40:41.340 --> 40:45.044
They're charging her with disturbing the
peace, resisting arrest, reckless assault.

40:45.144 --> 40:47.713
- Reckless assault? For what?
- How much is the bail?

40:47.813 --> 40:50.649
- $25,000.
- $25,000?

40:50.749 --> 40:52.851
With, where are you going?

40:52.951 --> 40:56.812
To bail her out. What do you think?
Come on. Let's go.

41:01.161 --> 41:03.730
Is there any way around
paying for this permit, Jim?

41:03.830 --> 41:06.198
I have a money problem.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.417
<i>You could call it performance art
and get a permit</i>

41:08.517 --> 41:10.805
<i>and set up a temporary
art museum for free.</i>

41:10.905 --> 41:14.074
That's brilliant.
Why didn't we do that to begin with?

41:14.174 --> 41:17.011
<i>It's risky. Most curators
don't want the controversy.</i>

41:17.111 --> 41:19.963
<i>There's no guarantee
you'll get the permit.</i>

41:21.215 --> 41:23.542
<i>With? You there?</i>

41:24.652 --> 41:27.008
Jim, let's do it.

41:28.057 --> 41:30.145
<i>Are you sure?</i>

41:31.126 --> 41:32.884
Yes.

41:34.762 --> 41:40.092
We require a 10% deposit,
so for you... that's $2,500.

41:40.192 --> 41:42.938
As soon as we... you know,
as soon as we get the check from you,

41:43.038 --> 41:44.440
we can get her out of there.

41:44.540 --> 41:47.098
- Thanks.
- Yep.

41:47.610 --> 41:49.345
Roz, how much money
do we have in the bank?

41:49.445 --> 41:52.782
The next check just cleared.
It's, like, $1,500.

41:52.882 --> 41:55.685
You cannot use that money for bail.
That money is for DC.

41:55.785 --> 41:58.855
We're getting her out.
She's the reason this whole thing started.

41:58.955 --> 42:00.124
I should be the one in jail.

42:00.224 --> 42:04.175
So you're just gonna jeopardize
our entire plan to get Liv out of jail?

42:06.029 --> 42:08.432
No. There's another way.
We can get permits for free.

42:08.532 --> 42:10.406
- What are you talking about?
- I spoke to Jim,

42:10.506 --> 42:13.403
and he said that if we get museums
to sponsor us, we'll be fine.

42:13.503 --> 42:15.994
And if we can't?

42:16.875 --> 42:20.303
Then that's... that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

42:20.512 --> 42:24.249
Okay, look. I know how you feel.
We all love Liv.

42:24.349 --> 42:28.086
This is much bigger than her now.
Okay? You cannot do this.

42:28.186 --> 42:31.838
I'm not letting her stay in jail
one more hour, and that's final.

42:31.938 --> 42:34.160
That's final?

42:35.160 --> 42:37.575
- Who says?
- I say.

42:37.675 --> 42:40.451
Not happy? Walk away.

42:41.233 --> 42:44.237
That's a good idea. That's what I'm gonna
do right now. I'm gonna walk away.

42:44.337 --> 42:47.723
- What? Cali, stop.
- Don't.

42:53.647 --> 42:58.768
- What are you doing? We need her.
- We don't need Cali. We need Liv.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.950
We still need another thousand dollars.

43:28.016 --> 43:32.072
Are you okay?
We've been looking for you all night.

43:35.224 --> 43:39.296
Every revolution meets resistance,
and that's when things get real.

43:39.396 --> 43:42.599
Roz, I appreciate the halftime speech,

43:42.699 --> 43:46.035
but we're broke,
and Liv is in jail indefinitely.

43:46.935 --> 43:50.294
We're done. The whole thing just...

43:52.336 --> 43:55.246
- is dead.
- It's not dead.

43:55.346 --> 44:00.211
It's not dead. It got hit by
a freight train, sure, but it is not dead.

44:00.618 --> 44:02.493
With...

44:03.112 --> 44:05.866
do you even remember why you hired me?

44:05.966 --> 44:09.760
I don't know, 'cause you're cool
and you were willing to work for free.

44:09.860 --> 44:12.898
No. She didn't even read my resume.

44:12.998 --> 44:17.469
Before this, I threw events
and fundraisers. This is what I do.

44:17.569 --> 44:19.538
Liv is a political prisoner.

44:19.638 --> 44:23.375
This is more than enough to get
people together to throw a bail party.

44:23.475 --> 44:25.744
- Are you serious?
- It's not that complicated.

44:25.844 --> 44:30.049
We just get a venue,
some cheap liquor and food, and-boom!

44:30.149 --> 44:31.502
- She's out of jail.
- Boom.

44:31.602 --> 44:34.304
Yeah. Boom.
Now get the fuck up off the floor.

44:34.404 --> 44:38.074
Our fearless leader
is probably rotting in a jail cell

44:38.174 --> 44:41.227
on a dirty, urine-stained floor
getting gang-banged.

44:41.327 --> 44:44.598
- Liv, oh, you so pretty!
- Come on.

44:44.698 --> 44:47.751
Let this be your motivation. Get up.

44:51.254 --> 44:56.260
We are organizing a massive protest
with thousands of topless women in DC.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.763
But the real goal is to get
on the floor of Congress,

44:59.863 --> 45:02.702
speak to them about the fact that
there are these censorship giants

45:02.802 --> 45:06.874
that control the flow of nudity
and violence into our theaters

45:06.974 --> 45:08.940
- and our televisions.
- Yes.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.003
I think you'd be a great ally
for our cause. Hold on one second.

45:12.103 --> 45:14.112
Hey, With! Come here. Orson.

45:14.312 --> 45:18.080
- Guys, this is Dave. Dave, With and Orson.
- How's it goin', man? Nice to meet you.

45:18.180 --> 45:21.454
Dave is an investor and his family

45:21.554 --> 45:25.057
is in the beef and cattle industry and he's
really interested in helping us out.

45:25.157 --> 45:26.825
Why don't you tell him
about what we're doing?

45:26.925 --> 45:30.296
So we're trying to hack social media,
democratize the internet.

45:30.396 --> 45:32.999
We're trying to just kill censorship
once and for all in this country.

45:33.099 --> 45:36.069
And the leader of our movement
got arrested for a public stunt.

45:36.169 --> 45:40.040
And bail is $25,000. So we're trying
to raise some money to get her out.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.543
- Awesome.
- Do you want a drink? Let me get you drink.

45:42.643 --> 45:46.513
- Miss bartender, do you have any Everclear?
- Yeah. Sure.

45:46.613 --> 45:48.788
With, With, With, With, With!
I want you to meet...

45:48.888 --> 45:51.836
- so Alexandria, this is With and...
- Pippi.

45:51.936 --> 45:53.552
Pippi, nice to meet you.

45:53.652 --> 45:56.391
So we're helping them
raise money for the campaign,

45:56.491 --> 46:00.211
and now it seems for trial
and bail money too, yeah?

46:00.311 --> 46:04.935
- So, tell about revolution.
- It's not exactly a revolution, see...

46:05.035 --> 46:07.536
- Pardon.
- ...revolution implies revolve,

46:07.636 --> 46:10.772
like something that spins
but comes back to the same place.

46:10.872 --> 46:13.809
We want to transcend that.
It's time to evolve.

46:13.909 --> 46:19.232
This is more of an evolution. Next level.
A cultural operating system upgrade.

46:19.882 --> 46:21.818
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm drunk.

46:21.918 --> 46:24.153
Me, too. Nice to meet you.

46:24.253 --> 46:26.056
This is my friend.
I'm gonna take her away...

46:26.156 --> 46:28.958
- Okay. Okay. Very good.
- If that's okay with you.

46:29.058 --> 46:32.745
Have fun. Onwards and upwards! Yes.

46:33.563 --> 46:36.498
Orson, I need a drink.

46:36.598 --> 46:40.596
Hi. How are you doing?
Can I get another whiskey, please?

46:43.641 --> 46:46.209
Hey, how goes that revolution?

46:46.309 --> 46:49.980
We raised $450, but her bail's $25,000.

46:50.080 --> 46:53.089
We still have to pay the bond
and hire a lawyer.

46:59.024 --> 47:02.928
No. No, no, no. Jim, stop.
Please, you've helped me out so much.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.350
- Stop.
- Oh, cut it out.

47:06.164 --> 47:10.586
Here, just fill it out for what you need.
Don't go crazy.

47:12.805 --> 47:16.843
Okay. Get back. Kiddo, come on.
I love you too. Come on.

47:20.680 --> 47:22.711
I'm excited.

47:24.483 --> 47:26.352
- Hey!
- Look at that.

47:26.452 --> 47:28.242
A vision.

47:29.289 --> 47:31.859
<i>The lower clouds</i>

47:31.959 --> 47:34.561
<i>We tried to climb</i>

47:34.661 --> 47:37.397
<i>And love another</i>

47:37.497 --> 47:39.700
<i>Hope's my name</i>

47:39.800 --> 47:42.235
<i>They wore me out</i>

47:42.335 --> 47:44.872
<i>Protect my flame</i>

47:44.972 --> 47:47.875
<i>I'll make you shelter</i>

47:47.975 --> 47:50.446
<i>Hold on</i>

47:51.546 --> 47:54.570
<i>Where do you go?</i>

47:58.352 --> 48:00.456
<i>Hold on</i>

48:00.556 --> 48:05.355
<i>How far are you?</i>

48:08.864 --> 48:10.924
<i>You</i>

48:12.401 --> 48:15.111
<i>You</i>

48:19.209 --> 48:21.492
<i>You</i>

48:22.779 --> 48:25.056
<i>You</i>

48:33.891 --> 48:36.848
To the most beautiful humans on Earth.

48:37.962 --> 48:40.749
I love you all unconditionally.

48:41.298 --> 48:44.987
Give Cali and Roz some love. They're
the real reason why you're out of prison.

48:50.208 --> 48:52.511
I'm sorry...

48:52.611 --> 48:56.474
for being such a bitch all the time.

48:58.984 --> 49:01.269
Do you forgive me?

49:02.387 --> 49:04.645
I guess I have to.

49:05.691 --> 49:07.780
Oh, my God!

49:09.828 --> 49:11.731
Slimy!

49:11.831 --> 49:13.433
Greasy fucking kiss.

49:13.533 --> 49:15.001
- Do you wash your face?
- No!

49:15.101 --> 49:17.436
I knew you had a crush on me.

49:17.536 --> 49:19.873
- She did!
- I've been so rude all along.

49:19.973 --> 49:23.511
- You totally did. Oh, my God.
- I love that shit. I love that shit!

49:23.611 --> 49:26.604
That was make-out session!

49:33.671 --> 49:34.905
Cali, what's happening with DC?

49:35.005 --> 49:37.675
I'm trying to get the permits
for 10,000 women at the Lincoln Memorial.

49:37.775 --> 49:41.496
- Why the Lincoln Memorial?
- MLK, Forrest Gump... it's the venue.

49:41.596 --> 49:44.789
I thought we were trying to get
on the floors of Congress.

49:44.889 --> 49:49.003
DC is a fucking logistical nightmare,
okay? It is not happening. Hello?

49:49.103 --> 49:52.906
- Ready to see some propaganda?
- I want to see! I want to see!

49:57.613 --> 49:59.749
These are great!

49:59.849 --> 50:02.418
I finally got a hold of Elle,
and she requested a meeting with you.

50:02.518 --> 50:04.467
- Oh, my God. You got Elle?
- You got Elle?

50:04.567 --> 50:07.189
- Who's Elle?
- Who's Elle? She's everywhere.

50:07.289 --> 50:10.292
She's next up.
Bomit, Banksy, The London Police.

50:10.392 --> 50:13.063
She's the next bullet in the barrel.
So when are you free to meet?

50:13.163 --> 50:15.932
- Now.
- Yay!

50:16.722 --> 50:17.874
Yeah!

50:21.404 --> 50:24.174
So Milk's driving us
to an undisclosed location.

50:24.274 --> 50:26.861
You need to put
this ski mask on, all right?

50:36.620 --> 50:39.208
You're safe. You can take it off.

50:49.468 --> 50:53.538
So Kilo told me that you're organizing
a big event in DC.

50:53.638 --> 50:57.152
Yeah, we're planning on getting permits
for 10,000 topless women

50:57.252 --> 51:01.039
to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial,
and we would love for you

51:01.139 --> 51:03.917
to get involved in any possible way.

51:04.317 --> 51:07.772
- When is it?
- We're trying to do it before the elections.

51:09.255 --> 51:12.091
Here's what I can do.
A week before your event,

51:12.191 --> 51:17.698
I can trigger my teams to carpet-bomb
and tag the entire Tri-State Area.

51:17.798 --> 51:20.401
- But there's a problem.
- What's the problem?

51:20.501 --> 51:23.070
- Yeah, what's...
- What's your identity?

51:23.170 --> 51:27.241
- What's your name? Free the nipple?
- Yeah. You don't like it?

51:27.341 --> 51:31.412
I mean, it's a catchy phrase. I don't
mean to offend, but it's a tagline.

51:31.512 --> 51:34.516
It's not an identity.
You want to know who I think you are?

51:34.916 --> 51:36.836
Yeah.

51:41.857 --> 51:44.159
Girlrillaz.

51:44.259 --> 51:47.318
- I love it.
- Fucking brilliant.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.782
<i>Basta, per favore.</i>

51:52.882 --> 51:59.008
<i>I am aware that the Vatican are accusing
my show of being sinful and blasphemous.</i>

51:59.108 --> 52:02.878
<i>I do not endorse a way of life
but describe one,</i>

52:02.978 --> 52:07.317
<i>and the audience is left to make
its own decisions and judgment.</i>

52:07.417 --> 52:10.187
<i>This is what I consider freedom of speech,</i>

52:10.287 --> 52:12.723
<i>freedom of expression,
and freedom of thought.</i>

52:13.023 --> 52:15.292
<i>If you do not believe in these freedoms,</i>

52:15.392 --> 52:17.728
<i>you, the Catholic Church,</i>

52:17.828 --> 52:22.399
- <i>are imprisoning everyone's minds.</i>
- I would have that woman's babies.

52:22.499 --> 52:25.461
Do you think we'll actually
get to Madonna?

52:26.104 --> 52:28.733
If it's in the stars.

52:29.740 --> 52:34.001
- Oh, no more quotes.
- Ready? Come on. It's for our DC speech.

52:35.413 --> 52:40.019
All right. "In a country where obscenity
is defined, in large,

52:40.119 --> 52:45.557
"by things sexual instead of things
related to war and killing and hatred,

52:45.657 --> 52:47.359
what kind of world is that?"

52:47.459 --> 52:48.794
- Who said that?
- Hugh Hefner.

52:48.894 --> 52:52.889
- I love it, but he's a pornographer.
- Well, then you're gonna hate this quote.

52:54.600 --> 52:59.758
"I think the real obscenity comes
from raising our youth to believe

52:59.858 --> 53:03.410
"that sex is bad and ugly and dirty

53:03.610 --> 53:07.147
"and yet it is heroic
to go spill guts and blood

53:07.247 --> 53:10.316
in the most ghastly manner
in the name of humanity."

53:10.416 --> 53:13.487
- Who said that?
- Let me finish. It's Larry Flynt.

53:13.587 --> 53:15.573
"But ask yourself this question.

53:15.673 --> 53:20.895
- What is more obscene, sex or war?"
- That's my line. He stole my line.

53:20.995 --> 53:22.897
You weren't even born
when this speech was made.

53:22.997 --> 53:25.533
Whatever, it's just a confirmation
of my inspiration.

53:29.449 --> 53:33.275
<i>Everyday, the media plays glorified images
of violence instead of showing the...</i>

53:33.375 --> 53:37.246
<i>Fact: "Over two million juveniles every year
are incarcerated for violent crimes."</i>

53:37.346 --> 53:42.018
<i>Fact: "On average, 32 people are killed
by handguns every single day..."</i>

53:42.118 --> 53:45.955
<i>"Behavioral science shows that children
under the age of 8 can't tell the difference</i>

53:46.055 --> 53:49.759
<i>"between reality and fantasy, making them
vulnerable to adopting the violence..."</i>

53:49.859 --> 53:53.129
<i>"Kids like to imitate their heroes,
and, so many of our heroes</i>

53:53.229 --> 53:56.887
<i>solve problems
through killing and violence."</i>

54:19.291 --> 54:22.643
- No.
- Wake up.

54:27.032 --> 54:30.633
- When did you go to bed?
- 4:00 or 5:00.

54:33.104 --> 54:35.842
- I finished my speech.
- Really?

54:35.942 --> 54:39.912
- Do you want to read it?
- Yes. Can we do it outside, though?

54:40.012 --> 54:41.814
I need nature.

54:45.784 --> 54:48.054
- I love this. I love this.
- Which one?

54:48.154 --> 54:52.392
"Democracy don't rule the world.
You better get that in your head.

54:52.492 --> 54:56.313
"This world is ruled by violence,
but I guess that's better left unsaid."

54:56.413 --> 54:58.582
- Dylan.
- I love it.

54:58.682 --> 55:00.083
- You do?
- Yes.

55:00.183 --> 55:02.969
- You mean it?
- Yes!

55:05.989 --> 55:07.876
Incoming!

55:07.976 --> 55:11.949
- Here it is.
- A little surprise.

55:12.630 --> 55:15.400
A little homage to our sisters
in Pussy Riot.

55:15.500 --> 55:17.054
Oh, shit.

55:39.659 --> 55:41.895
- Free the nipple!
- Free the nipple!

55:42.045 --> 55:44.775
Hey! Free the nipple!

55:53.239 --> 55:55.171
Nipple!

55:56.143 --> 55:58.428
Hey, this guy!

56:06.787 --> 56:07.955
You know what I read?

56:08.055 --> 56:12.427
I read once that if you take
the best orgasm you've ever had, right?

56:12.527 --> 56:16.665
And you multiply it times 100,
it's literally a drop in the bucket

56:16.765 --> 56:19.000
compared to the bliss you feel
from enlightenment.

56:19.100 --> 56:23.105
Well, no wonder organized religions
hate pleasure for pleasure's sake.

56:23.205 --> 56:24.452
You can't generalize religion.

56:24.552 --> 56:27.192
Yes, I can, they demonize it,
they make you feel guilty about it.

56:27.292 --> 56:29.363
My entire childhood,
I thought that God was up there

56:29.513 --> 56:32.115
watching me fuck myself in my bathtub.

56:32.215 --> 56:34.483
Why are you so obsessed with masturbating?

56:34.583 --> 56:38.375
I'm not obsessed. I just need a variety
of ways to get turned on.

56:38.475 --> 56:42.325
For example. I have started masturbating

56:42.425 --> 56:44.861
to videos of myself masturbating.

56:44.961 --> 56:47.649
- Like this masturbation via feedback loop.
- No way.

56:47.749 --> 56:51.301
Yeah. It's amazing.
I actually came. Like ejaculated.

56:51.401 --> 56:53.837
- Stop.
- You've never ejaculated before?

56:53.937 --> 56:56.140
Oh, my God. Stop.
You're making this shit up.

56:56.240 --> 56:59.843
- You really are.
- No, I'm not. I swear. It's amazing.

56:59.943 --> 57:03.560
So hang on. Let me...
let me ask you a question. So you...

57:04.060 --> 57:08.586
you masturbate to videos
of yourself masturbating.

57:08.686 --> 57:12.676
Yes. It is so narcissistic,
but it totally works.

57:13.091 --> 57:16.461
Jesus Christ! Fucking douche-bag.

57:16.561 --> 57:20.366
- We're talking about orgasms!
- Orgasms!

57:20.466 --> 57:21.934
Yeah, if we can actually, like,

57:22.034 --> 57:26.205
collaborate and morph it into one event,
that would be amazing.

57:26.305 --> 57:29.361
Yeah, I think that would be so disruptive.

57:30.342 --> 57:33.079
Thank you. Oh, my God.
Spencer, you have no idea.

57:33.179 --> 57:36.416
You are my God today! Yes.

57:36.516 --> 57:40.353
Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yeah.
We'll send you all the information.

57:40.453 --> 57:42.707
Okay. Bye.

57:43.223 --> 57:44.691
Nympho!

57:44.791 --> 57:48.094
Get your ass... in here!

57:48.194 --> 57:51.766
On chante peitit saucisson!

57:51.866 --> 57:53.025
Come here.

57:55.770 --> 57:59.974
Oh, my God. We are so lucky.
You know who just contacted me right now?

58:00.074 --> 58:01.375
- Who?
- Spencer Tunick.

58:01.475 --> 58:03.111
- Amazing.
- He's huge.

58:03.211 --> 58:07.498
- So he's gonna be collaborating with us.
- Kick ass!

58:09.484 --> 58:11.453
I thought we were gonna do
the other one from now on.

58:11.553 --> 58:13.522
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. You go like this.

58:13.622 --> 58:15.438
Yeah.

58:16.024 --> 58:18.759
- Got your fingers.
- Yeah.

58:32.574 --> 58:34.576
Jim Black.

58:35.645 --> 58:36.579
Hello?

58:36.679 --> 58:39.850
<i>With, they aren't gonna
give us the permits.</i>

58:40.150 --> 58:44.555
What do you mean?
I thought you said you could do this.

58:44.655 --> 58:47.091
<i>I'm sorry. I tried.
I couldn't convince them.</i>

58:47.191 --> 58:50.919
<i>The museum's afraid
it will endanger their budget.</i>

58:51.495 --> 58:54.465
<i>I'm sorry, With. Wish I had better news.</i>

58:54.565 --> 58:58.570
All right.
I have to figure something out, Jim.

58:58.670 --> 59:00.494
Bye.

59:04.592 --> 59:06.178
What?

59:06.278 --> 59:09.734
- We lost the permits.
- What?

59:11.449 --> 59:14.820
- It's over. I fucked this up.
- It's okay, okay?

59:14.920 --> 59:18.257
We'll figure something else out.
You know? Forget DC.

59:18.357 --> 59:20.850
This is all my fault.

59:24.563 --> 59:27.374
With, look at me.

59:27.474 --> 59:29.789
Look at me.

59:32.973 --> 59:35.836
I feel like I'm letting
everybody down, you know?

59:38.111 --> 59:40.472
You didn't let me down.

59:53.494 --> 59:55.318
Sorry.

59:57.732 --> 59:59.501
It's...

01:00:07.209 --> 01:00:11.713
I don't know why I did that.
That was really weird.

01:00:12.213 --> 01:00:16.786
I wasn't, like... planning
on doing that or anything.

01:00:18.252 --> 01:00:21.283
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.464
With, you still have a towel on your head.

01:00:27.564 --> 01:00:30.955
And you're... not wearing shoes.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.292
Sorry.

01:00:41.545 --> 01:00:45.516
Cali, who's your contact in DC?
Give me the number. I want to call them.

01:00:46.556 --> 01:00:48.886
What is it that you think
you're going to accomplish?

01:00:48.986 --> 01:00:51.473
Cali, please give me the number.

01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:53.692
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you this.

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:57.662
Everything is booked, and even
if it wasn't, we can't get permits.

01:00:57.762 --> 01:01:01.766
Organizing thousands of topless women
costs a shitload of money we don't have.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:04.870
Pardon me for a second.
We're looking for eyeballs, right?

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:06.037
Obviously.

01:01:06.137 --> 01:01:08.875
I mean, how do you get attention
in this day and age, you know?

01:01:08.975 --> 01:01:13.121
Just, like, get some sort
of viral hit count Bieber...

01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:15.949
Gangnam Style, cat baby thing, right?

01:01:16.049 --> 01:01:19.118
No, no, no, no. You are not suggesting
we are doing a music video.

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:21.085
I'm not, but it's a valid art form.

01:01:21.185 --> 01:01:23.954
What I'm saying is what do you do
when you have an important message

01:01:24.054 --> 01:01:26.627
- that you want to get out to the people?
- You update your Facebook status.

01:01:26.727 --> 01:01:28.297
But to more people. You know?

01:01:28.397 --> 01:01:31.198
To the world. If you want to announce
you're running for President...

01:01:31.298 --> 01:01:32.232
Press conference.

01:01:32.332 --> 01:01:34.694
- Hold a press conference, exactly.
- Okay.

01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:37.682
So you've got your friend Jim, right?
He's got the press in his pocket.

01:01:37.782 --> 01:01:40.582
Why don't we put all that together
and grab a microphone and...

01:01:40.682 --> 01:01:41.976
Why would anyone else care?

01:01:42.076 --> 01:01:45.380
No one's gonna give three shits
about some speech. No offense.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.049
- Yeah. It's true.
- Unless you're topless.

01:01:48.149 --> 01:01:50.265
Well, what's the hook?

01:01:50.365 --> 01:01:54.869
Okay, what would be so undeniable
that the press would have to cover it?

01:01:54.969 --> 01:01:56.754
Wait.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:04.580
This is the perfect opportunity for us to
just wreak some serious street-art havoc.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.783
- Can we define havoc quickly? Before...
- And we don't have any bail money.

01:02:07.883 --> 01:02:10.996
Hear me out. It's just a thought. What if,
on Halloween, while the cops are busy,

01:02:11.096 --> 01:02:14.941
we got Kilo and Elle
to just go out on the street

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:18.011
and paste Free
the Fucking Nipple everywhere.

01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:21.865
So that when everybody wakes up
on November 1st, it's like the first snow.

01:02:22.165 --> 01:02:24.735
Yes. Yes. I like where you're
going with this. Keep going.

01:02:24.835 --> 01:02:27.271
Great. And then the next day,
we hold a press conference,

01:02:27.371 --> 01:02:30.641
and we take full responsibility
for the terrorist act.

01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:34.850
I fucking love it. I love it. I'm gonna
call Jim right now. I'm on it, guys.

01:02:35.212 --> 01:02:38.833
- <i>What day are you gonna do this?</i>
- November 1st.

01:02:38.933 --> 01:02:42.052
Jim, did you... did you read my speech?

01:02:42.152 --> 01:02:45.991
Yeah. The topless thing
is the Trojan horse,

01:02:46.091 --> 01:02:50.412
but the real dialogue that's happening
is about violence.

01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:54.433
- <i>Your movement is becoming poignant.</i>
- Great. Thank you.

01:02:54.533 --> 01:02:56.468
Let me off the phone.
I got some calls to make.

01:02:56.568 --> 01:03:00.121
Okay, cool. Thank you. Bye.

01:03:06.012 --> 01:03:10.049
Hey, Cathy. Yeah, it's Jim. Is he there?

01:03:10.149 --> 01:03:12.544
Well, get him out of that meeting.

01:03:16.956 --> 01:03:19.850
- Hey... With?
- Yeah.

01:03:20.127 --> 01:03:22.363
Come check this out.
I edited some stuff together.

01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:27.034
It's very rough, but it can give you sort
of a general idea of what is going on.

01:03:27.134 --> 01:03:29.938
- That's... you finished it. Everyone!
- No, it's not finished.

01:03:30.038 --> 01:03:33.902
People! Humans! Stop. Come
and watch this. Orson just finished the cut.

01:03:34.002 --> 01:03:37.579
It's a rough cut, though.
Not finished, so don't judge too harshly.

01:03:37.679 --> 01:03:39.488
Wait.

01:03:39.588 --> 01:03:41.374
There.

01:03:43.218 --> 01:03:47.622
We live in oppressive times.
We, as a nation, become our own thought.

01:03:47.722 --> 01:03:51.292
Jesus Christ is one of the most
historic victims of censorship and...

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:55.364
And even more disturbing, every...
and even more...

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:58.401
And even more disturbing...
...concern for commercial viability...

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:03.339
...Pontius Pilate was his censor.
And if you hate freedom, move to China.

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.070
Censorship, censorship,

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:11.014
censorship is an obvious hallmark
of any fascist, tyrannical regime.

01:04:11.114 --> 01:04:12.668
Hey.

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.718
Hey.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.854
It's 4:00 a.m.

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:21.379
You must crash.
We've got a big night tomorrow.

01:04:24.462 --> 01:04:27.078
Fuck. This is really happening.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.674
Yeah.

01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:31.735
It is.

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:36.040
Oh, and we have to call a lawyer...

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.144
to arrange for some bail money,
because someone is definitely...

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:43.883
- definitely getting arrested.
- Yeah.

01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:46.485
You nervous?

01:04:46.985 --> 01:04:48.787
Yeah.

01:04:49.087 --> 01:04:52.558
Destiny comes to those who listen...

01:04:52.658 --> 01:04:54.403
and fate sorts out the rest.

01:04:57.295 --> 01:04:59.633
I'm so proud of you.

01:04:59.733 --> 01:05:02.669
- Proud of me?
- And of us.

01:05:02.769 --> 01:05:05.123
Don't do this right now.

01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:12.630
I'm really proud of us too.

01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:19.775
I'm proud of you.

01:08:49.509 --> 01:08:54.481
<i>We are getting reports in that there are
hundreds of nude and seminude women</i>

01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:57.618

of New York City.</i>

No, march, still!

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:26.069
Okay.

01:09:33.154 --> 01:09:36.122
One, two, action!

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:51.880
One, two, action!

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:19.788

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.391
<i>And the sun, it will rise</i>

01:10:22.491 --> 01:10:25.495

01:11:13.761 --> 01:11:17.382
Holy moly,
Liz, she actually left her house.

01:11:18.267 --> 01:11:20.603
Alert the media!

01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:24.857
All right. Thank you for coming. I'm sure
that a lot of you are here purely because

01:11:24.957 --> 01:11:27.452
you owe me favors...

01:11:27.552 --> 01:11:30.926
or I once bailed you out.

01:11:31.026 --> 01:11:32.919
Peter.

01:11:34.101 --> 01:11:36.904
But no, really, you are all

01:11:37.004 --> 01:11:40.607
some of the most influential bloggers
and opinion writers I know,

01:11:40.707 --> 01:11:42.275
so I thank you very much.

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:46.446
I am here in lieu of my good friend, With.

01:11:53.487 --> 01:11:56.088
And maybe you've heard some murmurings
about her group of girls

01:11:56.188 --> 01:11:59.607
that have been tagging New York City
with "Free the Nipple."

01:12:00.885 --> 01:12:06.235
I just ask for a few moments of your time
to watch a video that With put together.

01:12:06.335 --> 01:12:09.905
And if not, well, I'll just fuck off
and post it on YouTube.

01:12:10.005 --> 01:12:12.259
Okay, I'll shut up.

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.677
<i>The film censors in America,
like the MPAA,</i>

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:04.663
<i>allow excessive violence
yet discourage nudity</i>

01:13:04.763 --> 01:13:08.856
<i>and one of the most beautiful acts
of humankind... making love.</i>

01:13:19.879 --> 01:13:22.415
Well, our sexuality
has been taken away from us

01:13:22.515 --> 01:13:24.851
and is essentially being sold back to us

01:13:24.951 --> 01:13:27.853
through advertisement
and all this stuff...

01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:34.373
You gotta be fair! You gotta be fair....

01:13:41.401 --> 01:13:45.290
My body's not yours to feel ashamed of!

01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:26.583
As a citizen of one of the most
violent countries in the world,

01:14:26.683 --> 01:14:29.579
I just want to ask one simple question...

01:14:30.253 --> 01:14:33.123
What is so obscene about a woman's body?

01:14:33.223 --> 01:14:36.561
If religious leaders believe
that God created man and woman,

01:14:36.661 --> 01:14:41.249
and they are so offended by our bodies,
don't arrest us for public nudity.

01:14:41.349 --> 01:14:43.601
Complain to the manufacturer!

01:14:43.701 --> 01:14:46.170
Get on your knees and pray for God

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:49.695
to make a less obscene version of us!

01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:58.758
<i>So you're watching the movie we made.</i>

01:14:58.858 --> 01:15:01.086
<i>All of us.</i>

01:15:01.186 --> 01:15:05.091
<i>Just a bunch of girls
who've never made a movie before.</i>

01:15:05.191 --> 01:15:07.340
<i>So why did we make it?</i>

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.695
<i>Because it's hard to change the world.</i>

01:15:09.795 --> 01:15:12.398
<i>You have to start somewhere.</i>

01:15:12.698 --> 01:15:16.436
<i>We need new heroes, new stories,</i>

01:15:16.536 --> 01:15:19.197
<i>and we need them now.</i>

01:15:32.052 --> 01:15:37.726
<i>Look what they've done to my song, Ma</i>

01:15:38.426 --> 01:15:43.798
<i>Look what they've done to my song</i>

01:15:43.898 --> 01:15:47.369
<i>Well, it's the only thing
I could do half right</i>

01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:51.106
<i>It's turning out all wrong, Ma</i>

01:15:51.206 --> 01:15:56.046
<i>Look what they've done to my song</i>

01:15:57.446 --> 01:16:03.881
<i>Look what they've done to my brain, Ma</i>

01:16:03.981 --> 01:16:09.459
<i>Look what they've done to my brain</i>

01:16:09.559 --> 01:16:12.529
<i>Well, they picked it like a chicken bone</i>

01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:16.733
<i>And they think I'm half insane, Ma</i>

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:21.690
<i>Look what they've done to my brain</i>

01:16:23.006 --> 01:16:28.747
<i>I wish I could find a book to live in</i>

01:16:29.447 --> 01:16:34.595
<i>I wish I could find a good book</i>

01:16:34.986 --> 01:16:38.539
<i>Because if I could find a real good book</i>

01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:41.828
<i>I'd never have to come out and look at</i>

01:16:42.428 --> 01:16:47.131
<i>Look what they've done to my song</i>

01:17:00.647 --> 01:17:04.183
<i>Well, if the people are buying tears</i>

01:17:04.283 --> 01:17:07.938
<i>They'll be rich someday, Ma</i>

01:17:08.038 --> 01:17:13.160
<i>Look what they've done to my brain</i>

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:20.431
<i>Yeah, maybe I'll be all right, Ma</i>

01:17:20.801 --> 01:17:26.407
<i>Yeah, maybe I'll be okay, Ma</i>

01:17:26.507 --> 01:17:29.543
<i>If the people are buying tears</i>

01:17:29.643 --> 01:17:33.482
<i>Then I'll be rich someday, Ma</i>

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:38.788
<i>Look what they've done to my song</i>

01:17:39.888 --> 01:17:46.161
<i>Look what they've done to my soul, Ma</i>

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:51.834
<i>Look what they've done to my soul</i>

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:55.037
<i>Well, they tied it in a plastic bag</i>

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:59.148
<i>And they shook me upside down, Ma</i>

01:17:59.248 --> 01:18:04.288
<i>Look what they've done to my soul</i>

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:13.915
<i>There's a shower of light</i>

01:18:15.025 --> 01:18:19.195
<i>Shoots across the sky</i>

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:25.066
<i>Gently flowing, the energy</i>

01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:30.942
<i>The stars flicker in time for you tonight</i>

01:18:31.342 --> 01:18:36.114
<i>If I seem out of place now</i>

01:18:36.714 --> 01:18:42.021
<i>I can see a way where I might be found</i>

01:18:42.121 --> 01:18:47.076
<i>There's a reason
that I've never felt right</i>

01:18:47.176 --> 01:18:51.635
<i>You always painted me wrong</i>
