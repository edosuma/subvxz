01:12.410 --> 01:16.519
All right, son. This is an ordinary lawn
tractor and we have to Tim-Taylorize it.

01:16.610 --> 01:21.080
So first we gotta remove this puny
12 1/2-horse Blade-O-Matic motor,

01:23.769 --> 01:26.920
cos we wanna cut lawn maintenance
time way down. So what do we need?

01:27.049 --> 01:29.400
More power.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.719
You learn well, my little one.

01:32.809 --> 01:38.559
We're gonna replace it with this.
Because this is more power.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.039
Wow.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.479
Darn right, "wow."

01:46.569 --> 01:49.600
This is a twin-cylinder 1600cc
motorcycle engine,

01:49.690 --> 01:51.799
normally aspirated at 58 horsepower.

01:51.890 --> 01:54.160
Your dad has ported and polished it,
blueprinted the crank,

01:54.249 --> 01:56.440
and balanced it
all the way through. Huh?

01:56.529 --> 02:02.400
It's got a reverse gear - who needs it? -
four forward gears and a suicide clutch.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.880
On a good, clear day,
the ET on this bad boy

02:04.969 --> 02:07.719
should be under 15 seconds
at quarter of a mile.

02:07.809 --> 02:10.600
We can do zero to 60
in under 5.5 seconds.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.440
- You gonna race it?
- You bet.

02:12.529 --> 02:18.840
As soon as we install this bad boy,
we're gonna enter the Indianapolis 500.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.759
By the time
the rest of the pack catches us,

02:20.850 --> 02:25.279
we'll have won the race
and mowed the infield.

02:25.370 --> 02:29.039
- Want me to get you a towel, Dad?
- Why would I want a towel?

02:29.130 --> 02:33.279
- To wipe the grease off your hands.
- Grease is our friend.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.120
When you work on heavy-duty machinery,
you expect some grease on your hands.

02:36.209 --> 02:39.880
As a matter of fact, you like grease all over.
Kinda like war paint.

02:40.569 --> 02:42.160
Yeah.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.440
Chief Spark Plug.

02:45.529 --> 02:46.920
We're gonna need
a variety of tools today,

02:47.009 --> 02:51.120
so you wanna make sure you get
all your tools lined up within easy reach.

02:52.209 --> 02:53.959
What's this one?

02:54.049 --> 02:57.080
Ooh, man.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.789
That's my Tolan precision-engineered
torque wrench.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.999
See the gauge there?
Measures pounds per square inch.

03:03.090 --> 03:06.039
You use this for all your delicate bolts,
like on the engine head,

03:06.130 --> 03:08.120
and when you bolt
the engine to the chassis.

03:08.209 --> 03:13.039
- Looks old.
- Oh, it's not old. It's experienced.

03:14.650 --> 03:18.430
This is the Yoda of my tool bench,
right here.

03:18.529 --> 03:20.519
Yeah.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.519
It's been in my family
almost 20 years.

03:24.610 --> 03:28.080
My dad gave it to me,
and someday I'm gonna give it to you.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.120
- Gee, thanks, Dad.
- You bet, buddy.

03:32.410 --> 03:33.959
Death to the heathens.

03:34.049 --> 03:37.479
And to all gladiators
who jump on my couch. Get off.

03:37.569 --> 03:40.440
- Here's my stuff for the rummage sale.
- Oh, good, good.

03:40.529 --> 03:42.759
Spartacus, did you go through
your closet yet?

03:42.850 --> 03:43.959
No, not yet.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.479
Would you please turn off the TV
and do that now?

03:46.569 --> 03:49.360
Mom, this is the bloodiest part.

03:49.450 --> 03:52.239
Brad, this rummage sale is a fund-raiser
to get your hockey team new uniforms.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.319
Now, turn off the TV now.

03:54.410 --> 03:57.680
Aw, man.

03:57.769 --> 04:01.549
While Brad was watching television,
I filled my box up to the top.

04:01.650 --> 04:05.430
Thank you, Randy.
It's nice to know I have one perfect child.

04:05.529 --> 04:10.080
- I do what I can.
- "I filled my box up to the top."

04:10.170 --> 04:12.600
Hey. Hey. Stop that.

04:12.690 --> 04:16.120
If I hear any fighting,
there's gonna be liver for dinner.

04:21.488 --> 04:24.759
Hi, Mommy.
Look, I'm all greased up.

04:24.850 --> 04:29.600
Well, how nice for you. I think
you missed a spot, right here on your nose.

04:30.049 --> 04:31.959
Good eye, Mom.

04:32.049 --> 04:36.319
So this is the "slight adjustment"

04:36.410 --> 04:38.440
to the riding mower
you were talking about?

04:38.529 --> 04:41.479
Slight 150-horsepower adjustment.

04:45.009 --> 04:47.279
- What do you think?
- Well, with that engine,

04:47.370 --> 04:52.519
you won't just be cutting the grass,
you'll be sucking it up by the roots.

04:52.610 --> 04:55.360
Why do you always come out here
and mess up my tools?

04:55.450 --> 04:58.559
I'm sorry.
I'm just looking for the duck tape.

04:58.650 --> 05:04.519
It's not "duck" - quack, quack - tape.
It's "duct" tape, like "heating duct."

05:04.610 --> 05:06.759
Well, excuse me.

05:06.850 --> 05:10.039
Duct tape.

05:12.170 --> 05:16.160
Excuse me while I rinse
the side of my face off.

05:18.249 --> 05:20.279
It's right over there on the pegboard.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.039
The pegboard?
What's it doing on the pegboard?

05:22.130 --> 05:23.680
Shouldn't tape be in a drawer?

05:23.769 --> 05:27.959
Jill, this is a garage,
not fabric World.

05:33.569 --> 05:38.039
In a shop, tape hangs on a hook
because it has a hole in it.

05:38.130 --> 05:42.039
So does your head,
but it's not hanging on a hook.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.479
If you borrow the tape, promise me
you'll put it back where it belongs.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.759
- Of course I will. I always do.
- Do you now?

05:46.850 --> 05:48.959
- Yeah.
- Recognize this?

05:49.690 --> 05:52.799
Spiral ratchet screwdriver found under the
sink this morning. What was that all about?

05:52.890 --> 05:57.719
Well, the ice was all stuck together
and I needed something to break it apart.

05:57.809 --> 06:00.840
- You pounded ice with this?
- Yeah. It worked great.

06:00.930 --> 06:03.680
Jill, this is a precision tool.
It's not an ice pick.

06:03.769 --> 06:06.920
- Tim, don't be silly. Give me the tape.
- No, no, no, no. No.

06:07.009 --> 06:09.680
How would you feel if I attacked
your little opera-record collection

06:09.809 --> 06:11.680
and used Madame Butterfly
for a frisbee?

06:11.769 --> 06:15.160
- You don't touch my records.
- Right, because I respect your space.

06:15.249 --> 06:19.400
That's your space, your zone. This is
my zone, my sacred territory, right here.

06:20.209 --> 06:24.519
Oh. So, uh, so this tool bench
is like your altar?

06:24.610 --> 06:27.600
This is where I pray to the tool gods.

06:29.489 --> 06:33.239
Gosh, I am so moved, I think that I should
sing a chorus of "Amazing Wrench."

06:33.330 --> 06:34.390
Don't do this.

06:34.489 --> 06:38.880
Amazing wrench,
how sweet the sound

06:43.930 --> 06:46.959
Do you hear the laughter, right here?

06:47.049 --> 06:50.120
Just promise me
you'll ask me if you wanna borrow a tool.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.840
- OK, fine.
- I want you to swear.

06:51.930 --> 06:53.440
- Oh, please.
- Come on. Humor me.

06:53.529 --> 06:56.440
- Tim.
- It'll help me emotionally if you do this.

06:56.529 --> 06:58.360
- Come on. Stand up.
- Stand up?

06:58.450 --> 07:01.479
Stand up.
Put your right arm up.

07:02.650 --> 07:06.239
Put your left arm...
Put your left arm on the tool.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.440
- The wrench?
- The wrench.

07:14.610 --> 07:16.200
Repeat after me: I, Jill...

07:17.249 --> 07:19.239
I, Jill...

07:25.729 --> 07:29.080
I, Jill, swear on this Binford
cordless ratchet wrench...

07:29.170 --> 07:31.200
..swear on this
blah-blah, blah-blah, blah-blah wrench...

07:31.289 --> 07:35.039
- ..Binford cordless ratchet wrench...
- ..ratchetwrench...

07:35.130 --> 07:39.200
..that I will never touch my husband
Tim Taylor's tool bench ever again.

07:39.289 --> 07:41.559
Ever again.

07:43.289 --> 07:44.959
- Touched it.
- Jill...

07:45.049 --> 07:48.590
Touched it. Touched it. Touched it.

07:48.690 --> 07:51.880
Can you feel the anger
in this room right now?

07:51.969 --> 07:54.759
You have irritated the tool gods.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.319
You must now be smeared
with the holy grease of disdain.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.969
Tim, don't you even think about it.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.160
Tim. Tim...

08:05.249 --> 08:07.880
I'm no longer Tim.
I'm Zortheus, the Tool Avenger.

08:11.049 --> 08:13.509
I am Zortheus.
Yah.

08:19.450 --> 08:21.440
Oh, no.

08:23.130 --> 08:27.039
Mark, honey, come on in here.
I have to wash you up for lunch.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.440
Coming.

08:33.808 --> 08:36.400
- Mom?
- Yeah?

08:38.729 --> 08:42.919
- Have you seen my sneakers?
- Yes. They're in the trash.

08:43.009 --> 08:44.719
You can't throw those away.

08:44.809 --> 08:49.930
Honey, it wasn't my idea. The sneakers
begged me. They did. They...

08:50.289 --> 08:55.039
Please, Mrs Taylor,
let us go.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.690
We're old.
We're tired.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.959
We smell.

09:00.049 --> 09:03.880
Mom, these are my favorites.
Please?

09:03.969 --> 09:08.120
OK. Duct-tape them up.

09:10.209 --> 09:13.559
Then you can have a month to say
goodbye to 'em, and then it's a new pair.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.759
- Thanks, Mom.
- OK.

09:15.850 --> 09:18.229
Mark, honey,
I thought you were helping your dad.

09:18.330 --> 09:19.880
No.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.920
Well, I know that he really likes it
when you help him.

09:23.009 --> 09:26.239
Maybe later.
I'm gonna go play with my truck.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.360
Oh, OK.

10:28.330 --> 10:31.719
So, what'd you do?
Join Hell's Gardeners?

10:34.210 --> 10:36.359
Pretty cool, huh?

10:36.450 --> 10:39.399
All you need is a tattoo:
"Born to mulch."

10:39.489 --> 10:41.200
Yeah.

10:43.450 --> 10:47.040
And, honey, you know what?
You can be my lawn-mowin' momma.

10:47.649 --> 10:50.439
You know, Tim, the only reason
that you're doing all of this

10:50.529 --> 10:52.960
is cos your mother
wouldn't let you have a motorcycle.

10:53.049 --> 10:54.879
She never let me have a dog.

10:54.969 --> 10:59.200
You don't see me out here
rewiring a cocker spaniel, do you?

11:04.169 --> 11:06.549
- Where'd that go?
- What?

11:08.089 --> 11:11.040
My torque wrench was right here. You
weren't out here this afternoon, were you?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.080
- Why?
- I'm missing my torque wrench.

11:13.169 --> 11:15.200
I don't even know
what a torque wrench is.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.359
You weren't cracking any ice today,
were you?

11:17.450 --> 11:22.569
Oh, Tim, you don't crack ice with a
wrench. You crack ice with a screwdriver.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.319
Cute, Jill.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.480
It's gotta be in here someplace.

11:27.569 --> 11:30.359
I swear I have not touched
any of your tools

11:30.450 --> 11:33.600
since I took the oath this morning
always to ask, always to return.

11:33.689 --> 11:37.279
Well, somebody took it
and didn't return it.

11:37.370 --> 11:42.040
Whoever that somebody is
is gonna be in big, big trouble.

11:49.450 --> 11:51.879
- What's in this box?
- The wrench is not in there.

11:51.969 --> 11:54.879
That's stuff for the rummage sale.
There's nothing but junk in there.

11:54.969 --> 11:59.160
Junk? This is that swivel-based
cookbook holder I built you.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.120
- Is it?
- I thought you said you lost this.

12:02.210 --> 12:04.239
Well, I guess you found it.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.319
Great.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.120
Look. Look.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.669
It's that hair dyer I rewired for you.

12:14.770 --> 12:18.160
Honey, I really loved it but it...
it melted all my hairbrushes.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.759
Don't throw it out.
Use it for a space heater.

12:20.850 --> 12:23.640
Tim, Tim, stop it. Stop it.
Come on, honey,

12:23.730 --> 12:26.799
you'll turn the whole house upside down.

12:26.890 --> 12:29.000
That wrench has gotta be
around here someplace.

12:29.089 --> 12:31.439
You know, it just didn't get up
and walk away, Jill.

12:31.529 --> 12:34.799
OK, you're right.
I'm ready to talk.

12:34.890 --> 12:39.160
I sneak down here at night,
take all your tools,

12:39.250 --> 12:41.759
go out to the backyard,
put 'em in a big pile,

12:41.850 --> 12:44.480
and dance around 'em naked.

12:46.450 --> 12:49.080
What time would that be?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.730
Sometime right after you go to sleep.

12:51.810 --> 12:55.960
Tim? Do you want this
on regular cycle or fluff?

12:56.049 --> 12:59.560
All right.

12:59.649 --> 13:02.399
My tool.
It's all busted up.

13:02.489 --> 13:05.879
The gauge is missing,
the dial's all bent.

13:07.049 --> 13:10.200
- How'd that get in the dyer?
- I'll give you three guesses.

13:12.210 --> 13:15.520
You'll never take me alive.
Yah.

13:17.489 --> 13:19.950
Mark, why are you hiding back here?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.759
I'm not hiding.

13:21.850 --> 13:24.640
- Yes, you are.
- What'd you do?

13:25.969 --> 13:28.350
You swear you won't tell Mom and Dad?

13:28.450 --> 13:31.919
Yeah, we swear.
Don't we, Brad?

13:32.009 --> 13:34.359
Yeah, we swear.

13:34.450 --> 13:37.120
So, what'd you do?

13:37.210 --> 13:40.160
I broke Daddy's torque wrench.

13:43.450 --> 13:46.239
Whoa, that is bad.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.359
Real bad.

13:48.450 --> 13:51.239
He broke a tool -
just like Peter.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.080
Who's Peter?

13:53.169 --> 13:57.879
He's our little brother
we used to have before you.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.640
No.

14:05.730 --> 14:09.160
- He broke Dad's flashlight.
- What'd they do with him?

14:09.250 --> 14:11.549
They traded him in for you.

14:13.049 --> 14:15.399
They did not.

14:15.489 --> 14:18.719
Well, nice knowing ya.

14:18.810 --> 14:22.160
Maybe this time
we'll get a dog instead.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.919
Brad, Randy, Mark,
where are you?

14:25.009 --> 14:27.239
- What am I gonna do?
- Keep hiding.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.839
They can't trade you in
if they can't find ya.

14:31.890 --> 14:34.879
Now, don't get crazy.
Remember, it's just a tool.

14:34.969 --> 14:38.879
Just a tool?
20 years in my family. Just a tool?

14:38.969 --> 14:43.160
- Were you looking for us?
- Yeah, front and center. Park it.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.399
We're missing somebody.
Where's Mark?

14:45.489 --> 14:47.759
We haven't seen him.

14:47.850 --> 14:52.439
Now, boys, your father has something
that he wants to talk to you about...

14:52.529 --> 14:54.520
calmly.

14:56.210 --> 14:59.560
Which one of you lug nuts
broke this torque wrench?

14:59.649 --> 15:01.560
Tim, easy.
Easy, easy, easy.

15:01.649 --> 15:04.600
I didn't break it, you didn't break it.
Who's left?

15:04.689 --> 15:07.359
Butch and Sundance.

15:07.450 --> 15:12.839
- Why are you always blaming us?
- Because we're always guilty, aren't we?

15:12.930 --> 15:14.719
Some people think we're nice.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.759
Really?
Name one.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.759
Billy's mom thinks
we're perfect little gentlemen.

15:19.850 --> 15:24.839
Billy's mom thought
she saw Elvis yesterday at the gas station.

15:29.649 --> 15:31.359
What do you know about
the broken wrench?

15:31.450 --> 15:34.520
We think you should
ask somebody else.

15:36.210 --> 15:38.839
Yeah.
Someone short...

15:38.930 --> 15:40.919
and seven.

15:45.009 --> 15:48.319
Wait. You're saying Mark had
something to do with breaking my tool?

15:48.410 --> 15:52.000
Hey, we don't tattle
on some brothers...

15:52.089 --> 15:56.680
who happen to be hiding
in the backyard like a coward.

16:00.689 --> 16:03.560
Hey, hey, hey. You're quite
the climber there, little neighbor.

16:03.649 --> 16:06.109
- Hi, Wilson.
- You playing hide-and-seek?

16:06.210 --> 16:08.770
Just hide.

16:08.850 --> 16:11.359
Anybody in particular
you're hiding from?

16:11.450 --> 16:14.960
- My dad.
- Mark? Mark?

16:15.049 --> 16:18.080
- Promise you won't tell him I'm here?
- Scout's honor.

16:18.169 --> 16:20.629
Mark, where are you, son?

16:24.169 --> 16:26.120
Hi, Wilson. I'm looking for Mark.
Have you seen him?

16:26.210 --> 16:33.000
Well, as the old saying goes, Tim:
the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree.

16:33.089 --> 16:35.649
Right, Wilson.
I'm looking for my son.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.200
What I'm tying to say, Tim,

16:37.290 --> 16:42.040
is sometimes, to get what you want,
you have to go out on a limb.

16:42.129 --> 16:46.759
I don't have time for this, Wilson.
I'm looking for my boy.

16:46.850 --> 16:48.600
- He didn't want me to tell you.
- What?

16:48.689 --> 16:53.680
He's up in the tree.
Tim, I think he's pretty unhappy.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.200
If you haven't seen him,
you haven't seen him. Thanks.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.919
Don't mention it, good neighbor.

17:01.009 --> 17:03.960
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark.

17:04.049 --> 17:07.439
Sure gonna miss him.
Probably ran away.

17:07.529 --> 17:12.200
Boy, he's the best darned assistant
a dad could ever have.

17:15.290 --> 17:18.520
I don't think I can finish
that mower without him.

17:18.608 --> 17:22.148
I don't think I'll be able
to rewire anything ever again.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.398
Boy, could that kid grunt.

17:27.608 --> 17:30.759
No matter where you are, Mark,
this one's for you.

17:36.850 --> 17:39.640
- That tree just grunted at me.
- No, it didn't.

17:39.730 --> 17:43.350
- Yes, it did. I heard it.
- No, Daddy. It's me.

17:43.450 --> 17:46.560
Mark, what are you doing
up in the tree?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.799
I did something bad.

17:49.810 --> 17:52.189
You broke my tool,
didn't you, Mark?

17:52.290 --> 17:56.279
It jumped
right out of my hand.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.750
It shouldn't have been in your hand,
all right?

17:58.850 --> 18:01.719
I was just playing.

18:01.810 --> 18:05.919
We've been through this before -
my tools are not your toys.

18:06.890 --> 18:11.560
I'm sorry I broke your tool.
It was an accident.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.319
Accidents happen.
It's not the end of the world.

18:17.410 --> 18:21.319
But when you break something that's
somebody else's, you gotta tell them.

18:22.049 --> 18:25.319
Please don't trade me away,
like you did Peter.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.750
Peter?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.150
The son you traded in for me.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.549
- What are you talking about?
- The one who broke your flashlight.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.069
Don't you even remember him?

18:49.079 --> 18:51.589
Where do you get ideas...

18:51.680 --> 18:54.269
Let me guess.

18:54.359 --> 18:55.950
Brad? Randy?

18:56.039 --> 18:58.470
Book it.

18:58.559 --> 19:01.789
Mark, you wanna listen to this good.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.190
I would never trade you for anything.

19:05.279 --> 19:07.789
- Really?
- Really.

19:14.079 --> 19:17.990
You know that tape measure
that you could never find?

19:18.079 --> 19:19.990
Go ahead, tell me -
you lost it.

19:20.079 --> 19:22.230
No.
Brad and Randy broke it.

19:22.319 --> 19:25.309
Good to have you back, son.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.339
Honey, the moment we've been waiting for
has finally arrived.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.509
Tim, you know, it's October.
You really don't have to cut the grass now.

19:33.599 --> 19:35.509
Honey.
I'm not cutting the grass.

19:35.599 --> 19:40.230
I'm just taking the Taylor 1600cc
lawn chopper out for a test run.

19:40.319 --> 19:44.349
Honey, couldn't we just call your mother
and ask if it's OK if you have a motorcycle?

19:44.839 --> 19:48.829
Jill, don't worry. I got a helmet.
seat belt. What could happen?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.829
- Come on. Dad.
- Hurry up.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.910
All right, boys.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.549
Prepare yourself
for a new age in lawn maintenance.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.950
I think we all remember it used to take Dad
an hour, an hour and 20, to do the lawn.

20:05.039 --> 20:08.150
With this bad boy -
a minute and five.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.869
I'll cut this thing so fast
it'll be afraid to grow.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.789
Honey, did you put
hubcaps on the lawn mower?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.109
- Yeah.
- Why did you do that?

20:21.200 --> 20:23.190
I don't know.

20:24.279 --> 20:26.789
- Start the engine. Dad.
- Yeah, pop a wheelie.

20:29.240 --> 20:34.230
Stand back. I think this monster
mowing machine is ready to come to life.

20:34.319 --> 20:36.470
All right, boys, inside.

20:36.559 --> 20:40.150
You can watch from the window.
Brad, come on. Go, go, go, go.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.349
- You can't watch from the pit area.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.710
Gentlemen, start your engines.

21:01.839 --> 21:03.829
Lawn ho.

21:10.559 --> 21:12.150
I'm all right.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.789
Now that we have the fitting in place
between the mo sections of pipe.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.440
- what's the next step?
- Well. Tim, we'll be sweating the pipe.

21:24.519 --> 21:25.500
- Will we?
- That's right.

21:25.599 --> 21:28.630
So we'll put a little deodorant
right there in the elbow?

21:29.279 --> 21:33.589
- I don't think so. Tim.
- We do need heat for this project.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.220
and for that we use the Binford Burnblaster
2000 propane torch.

21:37.319 --> 21:41.099
- Wanna grab the torch. Al?
- Yeah. Coming right up. Tim.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.470
Torch, please. Al.

21:47.559 --> 21:49.349
Gimme a second. Tim.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.950
Al? We're on the air. Al.
We need that torch.

21:52.039 --> 21:53.910
I'm looking. I'm looking.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.549
Al, it's a critical part of the show.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.349
Thousands of viewers
are waiting to see that thing.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.430
I'm trying, dammit.
I'm only human.

22:02.599 --> 22:07.069
Oh, relax. Come on, Al...
Oh, look. It's right over here.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.349
Folks, this is a demonstration.
Don't try this at home.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.589
I hid the torch from Al.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.670
You what?

22:17.799 --> 22:20.990
- I, you know, didn't mean to panic you.
- You hid the torch?

22:21.079 --> 22:25.029
- To make a point.
- And what point would that be. Tim?

22:25.119 --> 22:29.109
Well, you should always know
where your tools are.

22:30.279 --> 22:34.190
cos otherwise you could get
pretty irritated, like you seem to be.
