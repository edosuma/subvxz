WEBVTT

00:00.793 --> 00:02.919
My offer's withdrawn.
You can walk to work.

00:03.045 --> 00:04.587
Got it. You're morally outraged.

00:04.713 --> 00:07.465
Now, can we get through this part?
'Cause the next part's awesome.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.550
How do you rationalize
something like this?

00:09.677 --> 00:11.719
You broke into Stacy's therapist's
office.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.889
- Borrowed a key.
- And stole her treatment notes.

00:15.015 --> 00:19.102
Nope. I made copies.
"Mark is," and I quote...

00:19.228 --> 00:22.271
"withdrawn, passive
aggressive, won't communicate,

00:22.398 --> 00:24.899
"like he resents me because I can walk."

00:25.025 --> 00:28.528
- I don't wanna hear this.
- "Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up."

00:28.654 --> 00:31.406
Meanwhile,
she can't stop thinking about...

00:31.532 --> 00:35.618
I can't read that, is she
obsessed with a gray horse or me?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.955
It says she thinks
you're an annoying jerk.

00:39.081 --> 00:42.875
It's a pet name. Here's the kicker.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.132
They're not having sex?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.303
Doctor cleared him, but no lift-off.

00:54.430 --> 00:57.265
She's frustrated,
so she's doc-blocking me.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.393
Paperwork, seminars,
meddling with my patients.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.978
But now you've got
the proof you need,

01:02.104 --> 01:04.105
just take those personal
psych records to Cuddy,

01:04.231 --> 01:06.774
and that'll show her
Stacy's out of control.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.526
You ignoring me?

01:08.652 --> 01:11.779
While looking for my newspaper.
Efficient, huh?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.031
Over here.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.704
Dr Wilson,
I want you to meet my stalker.

01:19.830 --> 01:23.458
- Your waiting room sucks.
- I am not treating you.

01:23.584 --> 01:28.254
- Because you're a closet case?
- We're not together.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.466
He is so self-loathing.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.718
But we gotta go now.
So, maybe see you after work.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.094
No, no, no, no.

01:36.972 --> 01:40.349
Nobody can figure out
what's wrong with me.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.062
Well, your shirt is gaping at the
collar. That means you've lost weight.

01:45.189 --> 01:48.357
You're flushed, that's fever,
and you're short of breath.

01:48.484 --> 01:52.028
And finally, there's the KS lesion on
your face. It means you're HIV positive,

01:52.154 --> 01:53.613
and you've progressed
to full-blown AIDS.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.615
So you're sick
because your immune system is shot

01:55.741 --> 01:58.075
and someone sneezed on you.
May I be excused now?

01:58.202 --> 02:02.121
Brilliant, but my immune system is fine.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.540
Your concentration-camp physique
begs to differ.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.460
- Get your T-cell count re-checked.
- I've already done that.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.755
- They test for T-cell lymphoma?
- It was negative.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.008
All of this will be fascinating
to an HIV specialist.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.636
Now let go of my cane
before it becomes your new boyfriend.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.222
Honey, I will marry it
if you will look at my file.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.766
Congress says you can't, so...

02:32.110 --> 02:34.153
I didn't touch him.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.531
He's going into anaphylactic shock.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.359
- Go see Stacy.
- We gave him epi. He's fine.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.988
You need a lawyer.
Go see Stacy. You hit a patient.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.449
Four words, two mistakes. He's not
a patient, and I didn't hit him.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.951
Of course you didn't. Go see Stacy.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.788
I didn't cause the anaphylaxis.
It's probably one of his HIV meds.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.540
- Abacavir.
- I'll pass that along,

03:27.666 --> 03:31.127
make sure the ER takes him off it.
Go see Stacy.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.757
- You have to treat him.
- Medically, this case is a snooze-fest.

03:36.884 --> 03:37.925
AIDS plus infection.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.969
You don't treat him,
he charges you with assault.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.763
Just 'cause he says I hit him,
doesn't make it true.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.142
Watch,
I am surrounded by naked cheerleaders.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.768
See?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.647
Although, I like my chances
of some action this morning.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.693
I forgot Wednesday was hooker day.
This could have waited.

03:56.486 --> 04:01.532
You make me meet you at your house.
Your husband is conveniently absent.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.745
Mark's at physio.
I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.080
I saw a rat last night.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.542
Well, I'm surprised
your feet are touching the floor.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.921
- I barely slept.
- What was Mark up to?

04:15.047 --> 04:17.840
If memory serves,
a quick climb up Mount Gregory,

04:17.966 --> 04:21.761
and you'd doze through a seal hunt.
Clubbing, shrieking.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.804
What're you doing?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.390
Sorry, it was just driving me nuts.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.434
You hate washing dishes.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.437
People change.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.861
I could make sure
you'd sleep like a baby tonight.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.574
Rather take care of it myself.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.871
- I was referring to the rat.
- Trenton Pest is sending a guy.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.877
What's going on?

04:57.339 --> 04:58.547
It's not what you think.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.759
I know it looks like we're cleaning
dishes, but actually we're having sex.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.094
We're working.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.640
Wow, wish I had become a doctor.
Place would be spotless.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.853
Take 10 minutes,
cure the guy, and stop whining.

05:15.816 --> 05:21.737
I give you Kalvin Ryan, so flamboyant
in person, so boring on paper.

05:21.863 --> 05:26.409
Obviously got an opportunistic
infection, probably TB or PCP.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.828
Have you read his file?

05:28.954 --> 05:32.665
I started, but I found
the characters two-dimensional.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.792
He went to an HIV clinic last week.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.838
Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC,
CMV, HSV.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.132
- It's not an infection.
- HIV clinic.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.134
So few patients, so much money.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.469
- Redo the tests.
- The results make sense.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.681
Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.
That's strong enough to fight infection.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.768
- Fine, parasite.
- Nope. The stool sample was negative.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.021
Two months ago,
he was down to 30 T-cells.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.064
Then he changed his meds,
his immune system rebounds,

05:57.190 --> 06:01.777
his viral load drops, everything's
getting better, but he's getting sicker.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.323
Face it.
This might be an interesting case.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.332
What if his immune system
is too strong?

06:16.168 --> 06:19.587
An auto-immune disease?
With HIV, that's impossible.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.674
His new HIV meds
kicked his system out of a sound sleep.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.178
It wakes up hungry, cranky,
spoiling for a fight.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.513
And when it doesn't find
an active infection,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.850
it starts attacking the harmless
remnants of old infections.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.227
Immune reconstitution syndrome.

06:35.353 --> 06:39.940
His meds made him so much better,
he made himself sick?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.650
- Sounds pretty...
- Boring!

06:41.777 --> 06:43.527
This is so not interesting.

06:43.653 --> 06:47.156
Chest x-ray to find the old infection
and start him on steroids.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.997
If you're wrong, the steroids will tank
his immune system. He'll get worse.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.042
Now that would be interesting.
Where's the Coumadin?

06:58.168 --> 07:01.253
If your patient's got a blood problem,
then blood thinners aren't exactly...

07:01.379 --> 07:05.257
It's for Stacy's rat.
Death by anticoagulation.

07:05.383 --> 07:10.846
Trying to win Stacy back
by killing an animal. Very caveman.

07:10.972 --> 07:15.309
I don't want her back. I just want her
to admit her feelings for me.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.769
I go to Cuddy,

07:16.895 --> 07:21.732
Cuddy fires her or reassigns her.
Either way, I'm happy.

07:21.858 --> 07:26.445
If you want her back,
either tell her or, better yet,

07:26.571 --> 07:29.824
shut up and cry yourself
to sleep like everybody else.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.702
Hi, this is, Mark Warner,
1724 Spring Street.

07:33.829 --> 07:37.289
Listen, you don't need to send
that guy down. We caught him.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.960
No, you should send the bill
to Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital,

07:41.086 --> 07:43.170
attention Dr James Wilson.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.679
Your lymph nodes aren't swollen,
that's good.

07:51.805 --> 07:57.017
- Maybe Dr Chase should check.
- Sorry, mate, hands full.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.563
He's too pretty to be straight.
You ever done any modeling?

08:00.689 --> 08:02.690
Does anyone actually fall
for that line?

08:02.816 --> 08:03.732
Every day.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.985
Why do you think
I became a photographer?

08:06.111 --> 08:09.989
I'm guessing you guys
didn't think about dating on career day.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.076
- I love my job.
- Really?

08:14.202 --> 08:19.290
You seem more the "find it
exceptionally satisfying" type.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.292
I'm not sure there's a difference.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.086
Your mom died of diabetes.
How's your dad's health?

08:24.212 --> 08:26.422
Last I heard, he had cirrhosis.

08:26.548 --> 08:33.846
Love is love. Satisfying is
"social validation, fun can wait."

08:33.972 --> 08:35.514
I have fun.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.975
Yeah, she's got some
scheduled for February.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.060
Last you heard, your father?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.355
He threw me out when I was 16.
It's just as well.

08:43.481 --> 08:47.401
I got tired of getting BB guns for
my birthday when I'd asked for a Barbie.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.987
Dads can be real sweethearts.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.364
Sensitive and cute.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.826
He's cute.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.963
He ran into that heating vent, right
there.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.677
Hopefully,
Mark's anger will go away eventually.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.598
He's not angry, he just doesn't
like you. Nothing unique there.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.143
Didn't seem real wild about you,
either.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.853
He's fine with me.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.606
He's angry. Said so in group.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.610
Of course he's angry. He's looking
at months of painful physio.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.489
- He's mad at you.
- There's no way he said that.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.536
No. But it's true.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.414
He resents you for being able to walk.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.087
Been there.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.968
I resented you for a hell of a long
time.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.264
Past tense?

10:05.647 --> 10:08.190
Might be the hospital.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.283
What?

10:17.409 --> 10:19.243
Bad time? Where are you?

10:19.369 --> 10:22.413
At your girlfriend's place.
Ignore the moaning and squeaking.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.623
His lungs are too scarred
to tell which infection triggered

10:24.749 --> 10:27.376
the immune reconstitution.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.877
He a smoker?

10:29.004 --> 10:31.380
Yes, and possibly
more than cigarettes.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.300
His tox screen came back
positive for recreational drugs.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.011
Not surprising, not medically relevant.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.554
His heart looks a little enlarged.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.432
That's a typical side effect of AZT.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.392
What are Kalvin's
most recent infections?

10:43.518 --> 10:44.685
Toxo, CMV,

10:44.811 --> 10:45.978
and PCP.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.817
Well, let's assume it's one of those.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.194
Give him ganciclovir for the CMV.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.196
We can hardly hear you.
Where are you?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.364
In a closet.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.492
Your girlfriend's
other boyfriend showed up.

11:00.618 --> 11:04.204
Ganciclovir for the CMV.

11:04.331 --> 11:09.460
Sulfadiazine for the toxo,
Bactrim for PCP.

11:11.046 --> 11:15.090
Gotta go. It's killing time.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.578
Your tox screen came back positive
for...

11:44.704 --> 11:48.499
Crystal meth and ecstasy.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.086
Recreational drugs are dangerous to
begin with, but for someone with HIV...

11:52.212 --> 11:57.341
I didn't mistake them for vitamins.
I'm a PNP boy.

11:57.467 --> 12:02.388
Party and Play. Drugs and sex.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.770
You don't approve?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.232
Does the sex include condoms?

12:13.358 --> 12:16.360
If he's negative, sure.
If he's positive...

12:17.570 --> 12:19.780
Why put on a raincoat
if you're already wet?

12:19.906 --> 12:22.324
You could get hepatitis,
or another strain of HIV.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.534
Or I could get hit by a bus.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.830
- AIDS isn't a death sentence anymore.
- I don't wanna have any regrets.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.795
How long have you been coughing?

12:35.964 --> 12:38.048
About an hour or so.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.553
Try to take a deep breath.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.475
- What is it?
- I think it's blood.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.159
I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.411
Your chances of conversion are slim,

13:07.537 --> 13:11.248
but I'd like to put you
on three anti-viral medications.

13:11.374 --> 13:15.586
Nelfinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine.

13:15.712 --> 13:20.507
There are side effects,
headache, nausea, vivid dreaming.

13:20.633 --> 13:27.097
You'll be tested for HIV at six weeks,
three months, six months.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.978
Very interesting.

13:33.104 --> 13:37.399
He coughs infected blood in Cameron's
eyes and mouth, that's interesting?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.736
The "coughing" part,
not the "in Cameron" part.

13:40.862 --> 13:44.323
New symptom,
blood vessel ruptured in his lung.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.158
I closed the tear.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.203
Well, it takes immune reconstitution
off the table.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.914
What's it put on the table?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.750
It's okay, she's not here,
you can skip the nice-guy acts.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.253
You know, some human beings
are actually capable of human feelings.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.340
My giving a damn or not
is not gonna change what happened.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.636
- Could be Goodpasture's syndrome.
- No edema, no bloody urine.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.096
Well, KS on his face
could mean KS in his lungs,

14:08.223 --> 14:09.056
with bleeding from the lesions.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.683
I would have seen them
when I repaired the tear in his lung.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.352
Wegener's granulomatosis?

14:13.478 --> 14:16.104
Wegener's
would have responded to steroids.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.233
Maybe you should go home,
take the rest of the day.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.943
I'm fine.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.321
Well, this is good.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.616
He's pretending to care,
you're pretending not to.

14:27.742 --> 14:32.037
I think we should reconsider drugs.
Kalvin uses crystal meth.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.665
Concerned enough about
his health to stalk me,

14:34.791 --> 14:40.337
while indulging in deadly street drugs.
A study in contradictions.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.798
Interesting,
but still not medically relevant.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.175
It could be, if his drugs were tainted.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.220
They cook meth
with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...

14:48.346 --> 14:54.226
Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins.
Foreman, you're with me.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.901
- I need a consult on another case.
- We have another case?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.028
It's a hip-pocket deal.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.739
Patient presents
with a distinct neck tilt.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.785
- Wry neck. Is he an athlete?
- He's a regular runner.

15:11.911 --> 15:16.081
- Any pain associated with movement?
- None that he's complained of.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.585
Best-case scenario,
an infection in the ear or lungs.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.837
Worst case, brain-stem tumor.

15:21.963 --> 15:25.007
You should do an MRI,
CAT Scan, full work up.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.052
I don't think so. No insurance.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.560
No drugs in here. I'll take the
bathroom.

15:38.521 --> 15:42.441
How about a drink after work?
Take your mind off what happened.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.697
Cameron?

15:48.823 --> 15:51.783
I might have HIV,
a drink's not gonna wash it away.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.536
There's like zero chance
of you contracting the virus.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.789
Big difference
between "like zero" and "zero."

15:57.915 --> 16:00.792
What did
the infection control guy tell you?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.836
He was very reassuring.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.423
Kept reminding me that the hospital
covers all my medical costs.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.842
Apparently forgot to mention
that if I do test positive,

16:08.968 --> 16:11.595
that they'll pass it on to legal,
and legal will dig up any dirt they can,

16:11.721 --> 16:17.184
trying to prove that I'm a drug user
or tramp, and that's why I have HIV.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.437
It's not like they're
gonna find anything, right?

16:20.563 --> 16:21.980
Right.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.524
Check this out.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.319
Kalvin's a photographer.
The broken bulbs were props.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.781
- The glass is from 1930s fluorescents.
- Some of the bulbs are date-stamped.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.825
Pre-World War II, fluorescent bulbs
contained large amounts of beryllium.

16:33.951 --> 16:38.163
Beryllium dust inflames the lungs,
they get rigid, patient can't breathe.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.793
My father co-authored
a paper on acute berylliosis.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.338
Phew! For a moment there,
I thought you were smart.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.717
Cameron, get a biopsy of Kalvin's lung
tissue, run a spectrographic analysis.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.927
I can handle it.

16:52.053 --> 16:56.932
No reason to risk exposing the entire
team. Then who would I torment?

17:03.022 --> 17:07.025
I'm sorry. About what happened.

17:07.151 --> 17:12.239
It's best not to talk.
You're gonna feel a sharp pinch.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.409
This actually is gonna grab
a piece of your lung.

17:19.247 --> 17:23.458
What were you guys looking for
at my hotel?

17:23.584 --> 17:27.629
Your drugs. We thought
maybe you'd used toxic meth.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.674
We'll know if you were exposed
to beryllium in a few hours.

17:30.800 --> 17:36.346
Well, if you're still curious,
it's in my bag over there on the chair.

17:36.472 --> 17:42.018
You brought drugs into the hospital?
Glad I wasted my time at your hotel.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.063
I told you I used,
you didn't ask me for a sample.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.023
You're not pissed about this,

17:47.150 --> 17:49.151
you're mad because
I coughed blood on you.

17:49.277 --> 17:52.821
- That was an accident.
- Would you stop being nice?

17:52.947 --> 17:56.658
It's useless, and worse, it's boring.
Get angry!

17:56.784 --> 17:58.577
I had one stupid night,
I end up with HIV.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.747
Do you have any idea
how pissed off I was?

18:01.873 --> 18:03.915
This wasn't your fault.

18:11.799 --> 18:16.470
- You broke into my house?
- Well, I had to, Mark isn't here.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.680
- He has physio.
- Oh, really?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.391
- How's he doing?
- What happened with all the cheese?

18:21.517 --> 18:25.771
Well, I had to get rid of it before
Steve McQueen ate any Coumadin.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.773
I named your rat.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.361
Steve's tilting his head.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.781
Any neurologist will tell you

18:35.907 --> 18:38.700
that suggests an infection
or a brain-stem tumor.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.662
- Death cures both those things.
- We can't kill him.

18:42.789 --> 18:47.083
If it's an infection, it could be caused
by something in your house.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.920
Something that could affect you guys.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.006
Smell this.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.384
Does it smell like urine?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.971
You missing any asparagus?

19:01.182 --> 19:06.937
Okay, stuff these. If he doesn't
get better, then it's a tumor.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.980
Then what, chemo?

19:10.107 --> 19:13.109
Steve McQueen without hair?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.362
It's a blessing he died young.

19:22.745 --> 19:23.787
Hello.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.790
Hi, honey.

19:26.916 --> 19:30.085
I'm sorry I missed you, yeah.
I came home.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.171
All right, I'll see you in a few
minutes.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.592
Okay. Bye, hon.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.065
Chest hurts.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.568
Heart rate's a 100 and climbing,
could be an allergic reaction.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.821
Neck veins are up.
Must be pericardial effusion.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.823
There's no wheezing.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.117
The tear in his lungs
must have reopened.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.203
Kalvin? You're bleeding
into the area around your heart.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.416
- I can't breathe.
- The blood's crushing your heart.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.587
- Once we remove it, you'll be fine.
- If I die, please tell my dad...

20:13.713 --> 20:17.924
- You're not going to die.
- Tell him sorry.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.355
Where's the blood?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.690
It's clear.

20:33.816 --> 20:38.194
Only one other thing could cause this.
A tumor in his heart.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.873
CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart,
and several smaller ones in his lungs.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.250
That's why his heart's enlarged,
not the AZT.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.585
You okay?

20:53.711 --> 20:56.504
She's fine, probably getting bored
with the question.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.674
Masses in the heart and lungs,
what kind of cancer are we looking at?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.842
They may not be cancerous.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.886
This is classic
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.971
HIV-positive patient
with a primary heart mass?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.892
- It could be sarcoidosis.
- His lung tissue was negative.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.436
Lymphoma's a death sentence,
sarcoidosis is treatable.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.981
So is an ear infection, but since he
didn't test positive for that either...

21:15.107 --> 21:17.609
I want to do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.

21:19.570 --> 21:24.032
Do you have any idea how much
paperwork Cuddy's gonna need signed?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.578
Do it.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.834
So...

21:34.961 --> 21:37.128
How's the patient's father?

21:38.381 --> 21:41.216
"Tell my dad I'm sorry?"

21:41.342 --> 21:43.677
Might as well have waved
a red flag at a bull.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.221
He's not coming.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.515
Well, it's not a tragedy.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.643
Dad doesn't wanna see him,
he doesn't wanna see the dad.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.645
You're the only one
who wants them together.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.815
- He asked.
- He thought he was dying.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.025
Dying people lie, too.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.070
Wish they'd worked less,
they'd been nicer,

22:02.196 --> 22:04.280
they'd opened orphanages for kittens.

22:04.407 --> 22:09.285
If you really wanna do something, you do
it, you don't save it for a sound bite.

22:11.706 --> 22:14.916
What did you say
when you thought you were dying?

22:16.794 --> 22:19.045
On the other hand...

22:20.881 --> 22:26.136
His dad tossed him out.
So what's our guy wanna apologize for?

22:27.096 --> 22:29.764
Everybody has regrets.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.565
If the growths in your lungs
and heart are sarcoid,

22:38.691 --> 22:43.820
your body will recognize this material,
and we'll see a reaction on your arm.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.160
- Did you really wanna see your dad?
- You called him?

22:52.663 --> 22:54.414
Thanks.

22:54.540 --> 22:58.376
He would've come,
tried to straighten me out.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.587
How are you holding up?

23:01.505 --> 23:03.923
- I'm fine.
- Convincing.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.593
What did you do with my drugs?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.803
The lab disposes of them
after analysis.

23:08.929 --> 23:12.891
Too bad.
They could've done you some good.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.102
Not really my thing.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.357
You know, I hope you don't have it, but

23:21.484 --> 23:26.654
getting HIV might have been the
best thing that ever happened to me.

23:26.781 --> 23:31.242
I used to be a good boy.
Never wanted to piss anybody off.

23:32.787 --> 23:37.665
Playing by the rules
makes everybody else happy.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.003
Now I'm happy.

23:45.466 --> 23:49.052
So you just show up
every time he's at physio?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.179
Of course not.

23:51.305 --> 23:55.100
Also when he's at group therapy
or out for dinner with friends.

23:55.226 --> 23:59.104
And when she happens to mention
to Mark that you dropped by...

23:59.230 --> 24:01.564
You tell your wife everything?

24:02.566 --> 24:05.110
It's a process.

24:07.238 --> 24:10.824
But Stacy doesn't have any reason
to hide this from Mark.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.910
As far as she knows,
Mark's okay with you being there.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.538
My bet is she mentions me
to Mark as little as possible.

24:16.664 --> 24:20.166
Because she thinks that he thinks
that she still has feelings for me.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.669
You know why she thinks that?

24:22.795 --> 24:25.171
Because she still has feelings for you?

24:25.297 --> 24:29.592
If you're right, she did tell him and
I don't get through the door tonight.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.970
If I'm right...

24:41.730 --> 24:45.108
So how long do we stay here?

24:45.234 --> 24:47.235
Until something happens.

24:47.361 --> 24:50.989
He's not gonna come out
with us right here.

24:51.115 --> 24:55.493
We are downwind,
and he seems to have hearing loss.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.787
He's not blind.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.040
Steve McQueen
does not run from danger.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.754
Antibiotics, on the other hand...

25:06.881 --> 25:09.591
He ate around the pill?

25:09.717 --> 25:14.095
- Smart.
- Admit it, you like him.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.640
He's all right. For a rat.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.310
You wanna know how cool he is?

25:20.436 --> 25:26.941
His urine showed traces of
hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.902
He's a smoker.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.448
Your husband's been lighting up,

25:33.574 --> 25:37.035
which is particularly stupid,
given that it could cause his AIP...

25:37.161 --> 25:41.122
Okay, I blow my smoke
into the vent so Mark doesn't know.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.250
I always knew.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.543
Bluffing.

25:45.669 --> 25:50.423
You started two weeks
after my surgery.

25:50.549 --> 25:54.636
- Menthols, then lights after a month.
- Why didn't you say anything?

25:54.762 --> 25:57.805
'Cause it helped me monitor
your misery level.

25:59.642 --> 26:05.063
One trip outside was a good day,
and upwards of six, you were in hell.

26:05.189 --> 26:08.816
You could have asked me how I was.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.028
I already knew.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.866
I'm sorry you were miserable.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.747
Sorry I caused you so much pain.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.646
Glad you changed your mind
about that drink.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.022
Come on in.

26:48.899 --> 26:53.111
You should get changed, there's this
new place on campus that looks...

27:00.577 --> 27:02.537
- Are you high?
- Uh-huh.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.793
I thought the lab
disposed of the drugs.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.169
Not all of it.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.259
Slow down.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.053
Your pupils are dilated. You're not...

27:19.179 --> 27:22.432
Come on, Chase,
don't turn into a good guy on me now.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.801
You're late. And hung over.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.639
Or maybe not.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.975
Why do you have a rat?

28:06.101 --> 28:07.352
Jealous?

28:12.358 --> 28:16.402
- Get out of my room!
- Don't you dare put this on me!

28:16.528 --> 28:18.529
I'm not gonna grovel, Dad!

28:18.655 --> 28:21.366
- That's not what I'm asking for!
- Like hell it isn't!

28:21.492 --> 28:24.410
- You said you didn't call.
- Well...

28:25.371 --> 28:27.580
Don't mind me,
just here for the show.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.750
Yeah, well, there's not gonna be any.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.293
What happened to the big apology?

28:32.419 --> 28:35.046
Yesterday he was all,
"Daddy, I'm so sowwy."

28:35.172 --> 28:36.381
This is none of your business.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.966
Well, you should've thought of that
before you stalked me.

28:39.093 --> 28:42.053
Now I'm interested.
So what's he got to apologize for?

28:42.179 --> 28:44.555
- You're the one who tossed him out.
- Now why would I do that?

28:44.681 --> 28:47.266
I don't know, because it's tough
to brag to your hunting buddies

28:47.393 --> 28:49.227
that your son knows
all the words to The Wiz.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.854
- That's a lie.
- 42nd Street?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.107
Much easier just to get drunk
and beat him.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.568
Explains his hating you,
and also your cirrhosis.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.780
Also, why the more I talk,
the more you sweat.

29:01.490 --> 29:05.952
What it doesn't explain,
is why he's got to apologize to you.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.623
Residual guilt for sharing
your special toy with other boys?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.875
Just leave it alone.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.670
You just wanna leave the bigot with
some peace of mind after you're gone?

29:15.796 --> 29:19.090
This has got nothing, and I mean
nothing, to do with him being gay.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.635
Now Kal brought this on himself
with what he did to his mother.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.680
- He steal her signature look?
- No.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.515
No, he killed her.

29:35.232 --> 29:39.444
- Kalvin lied!
- Yeah. That certainly is shocking.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.781
Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed
a transplant, they tested Kalvin,

29:43.907 --> 29:46.617
he was a match,
he was also positive for HIV.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.620
Mom never found
a qualified donor, she dies.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.999
Tragic tale.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.836
Undercut slightly by the rapid-fire
delivery and constant movement.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.546
Too much coffee this morning?

29:58.672 --> 30:01.799
He didn't kill her. Our bodies
aren't donor farms for our parents.

30:01.925 --> 30:05.094
It's not 1980.
We know how HIV is transmitted.

30:05.220 --> 30:09.182
If Kalvin got HIV through unprotected
sex, dad has every right to be pissed.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.226
- So you always use a condom?
- Yeah.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.270
Brothers on the down-low got to.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.397
I'm not ready
for any Foreman Juniors yet.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.108
- You?
- Working girls are sticklers.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.695
You're not gonna poll Chase?

30:24.573 --> 30:28.034
- I'm not an idiot.
- Obviously not.

30:28.160 --> 30:32.538
Who doesn't sleep with a drugged-out
colleague when they have a chance?

30:37.377 --> 30:38.961
Where's Wilson?

30:39.963 --> 30:42.590
We got the result of the Kveim test.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.932
But so...

30:51.058 --> 30:52.934
I have cancer?

30:54.228 --> 30:57.605
In all likelihood, yeah.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.649
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.070
And I am...

31:04.196 --> 31:05.696
dying?

31:09.910 --> 31:11.619
We need to biopsy the tumor.

31:11.745 --> 31:16.541
It's near your aorta, so getting
that sample carries serious risks.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.543
Is my dad still here?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.921
He hasn't been in?

31:26.134 --> 31:30.346
We'll inject a dye around your heart
to make the tumor visible on the CT.

31:30.472 --> 31:34.267
Then a surgeon inserts a guide wire,
runs it up into your heart,

31:34.393 --> 31:35.768
where he takes a small piece
of that tumor

31:35.894 --> 31:39.355
so we can look at it
under the microscope.

31:40.482 --> 31:45.152
- Ativan. It'll help settle you down.
- Why are you so calm?

31:45.279 --> 31:47.488
Not coming off meth helps.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.410
Last night probably
shouldn't happen again.

31:52.536 --> 31:55.246
Do you think I want it to?

31:55.372 --> 31:58.291
When two people have had sex,
unless it sucks,

31:58.417 --> 32:00.793
if they can do it again,
they're gonna do it again.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.713
And that's when things get complicated.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.966
And it didn't suck.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.806
So now you've gotta drum up
another excuse

32:13.932 --> 32:16.434
to be around the love of your life.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.394
Could hit another patient.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.522
Yeah, don't like to repeat myself.
People will say I'm formulaic.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.275
Well, that rules out letting
the rat go so you can catch him again.

32:24.401 --> 32:25.484
I can't do that.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.321
Steve needs two weeks' antibiotics
and a smoke-free environment.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.448
Cigarettes aggravated his infection.

32:30.574 --> 32:34.118
The rat is actually sick? That thing
could infect the entire hospital.

32:34.244 --> 32:37.455
Steve's infection
is not contagious to humans.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.957
I'm an idiot.
How do I miss mycoplasmosis?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.292
Was that the kid's father?

32:41.418 --> 32:44.170
Yeah. Remember the Black Death?
It started with rats.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.631
Well, what's he doing in the hallway?
Is the kid getting his biopsy already?

32:46.757 --> 32:48.132
He just won't go in the room.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.926
Who knows what else he has,
parasites, bacterial infection?

32:51.053 --> 32:54.388
- The kid doesn't have parasites.
- Not the kid, the rat.

32:54.514 --> 32:58.434
- Was he still sweating?
- Rats only sweat through their tails.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.436
Not the rat, the dad!

33:02.981 --> 33:06.567
- Where are they from?
- Montana. What's going on?

33:06.693 --> 33:10.696
You were right, it's a parasite.
Cancel the biopsy, it'll kill him.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.908
Hey, Daddy, come with me.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.371
Yeah, I'm not going in there.

33:20.457 --> 33:23.084
Your son asked to talk to you.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.713
Why is he here?

33:30.175 --> 33:33.010
He wanted to talk to you.

33:33.136 --> 33:37.348
Did you two used to hunt together?
Foxes? Did you kill foxes?

33:37.474 --> 33:39.100
It's Montana.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.853
Those masses in your chest
are not tumors.

33:42.979 --> 33:46.399
They're parasitic cysts
from a bug called echinococcus.

33:46.525 --> 33:50.236
Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard,
they can hunker down for decades.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.322
Growing, spawning,
shopping, putting on plays.

33:53.448 --> 33:59.078
- I've been tested for parasites.
- Okay, it's cancer. You happy?

33:59.204 --> 34:01.497
The cysts isolate the parasites,

34:01.623 --> 34:04.834
keeping them from showing up in stool
samples. Even in blood tests, cardiac...

34:04.960 --> 34:06.460
All right, you don't need me for this.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.463
But you've got
the same things in your liver.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.008
I have cirrhosis.

34:13.135 --> 34:17.138
Liver cysts have identical symptoms,
with one addition, fever.

34:17.264 --> 34:21.934
And liver cysts we can test for.
Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.854
So, option A, we draw some blood...

34:24.980 --> 34:26.689
No, no, no.
Look, you're not touching me.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.566
Well, you see,
this is why I need you here.

34:28.692 --> 34:32.194
I want you to tell your son that you
won't take a simple, painless blood test

34:32.320 --> 34:34.321
to save his life.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.463
You

34:50.589 --> 34:54.800
never expressed a shred of regret
for what happened to your mother.

34:54.926 --> 34:55.968
Jeez, Dad.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.763
If you'd have worn a damn rubber,
you'd have been fine.

34:58.889 --> 35:03.184
You could have saved her life.
You wouldn't be lying here.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.187
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it!

35:06.313 --> 35:07.980
You're really mad at him
for killing himself,

35:08.106 --> 35:09.774
and for destroying everything you love.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.443
I don't have time for this.
Are you gonna apologize?

35:12.569 --> 35:15.613
- I'm living my life the way I want.
- Are you gonna give me some blood?

35:15.739 --> 35:18.491
Look, if he doesn't give a damn,
then neither do I.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.618
Okay, option B.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.162
Why did your wife kill herself?
Did she hate you?

35:23.288 --> 35:25.206
She was a diabetic!

35:25.332 --> 35:27.374
You know, you don't know a thing
about my Susan.

35:27.501 --> 35:31.295
Either Susan wanted to die,
or she was both fat and stupid.

35:31.421 --> 35:32.838
Used a Twinkie instead of a gun.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.257
And girls with big appetites,
well, they just can't get enough

35:35.383 --> 35:36.425
- of anything.
- Shut up!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.469
Probably nibbled
on every Devil Dog in the county!

35:38.595 --> 35:40.346
- Shut up!
- In case I'm not making myself clear,

35:40.472 --> 35:44.016
- I don't mean the delicious snack.
- You son of a bitch!

35:45.727 --> 35:47.812
Yeah? Come on!

35:48.647 --> 35:50.856
Thank you. Means I can do this.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.610
We're gonna need some epi in here,
stat!

35:54.736 --> 35:57.530
- Are you out of your mind?
- You said you didn't care.

35:59.491 --> 36:03.410
Notice how you can't breathe?
Now, either that's the cane

36:03.537 --> 36:06.038
or, I just ruptured one of those liver
cysts we were chatting about,

36:06.164 --> 36:08.999
and you've gone into anaphylactic shock.
Exactly the same way your son did

36:09.125 --> 36:11.877
when he accidentally
tripped against my friend's car.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.421
I'm just so excited to find out which.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.972
I'm gonna schedule the surgery.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.811
Clamp.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.481
Pressure's holding.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.083
Give me the syringe.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.978
Clamps...

37:14.524 --> 37:19.445
Two successful surgeries,
two lives saved. I'm over my quota.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.196
Can I have next week off?

37:22.449 --> 37:26.160
- Two family members assaulted.
- It was self-defense.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.705
- You baited him.
- You're right, I was asking for it.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.666
The low-cut blouse, the do-me pumps.

37:32.792 --> 37:36.086
You flooded his gut with a parasite.
He could sue.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.173
Go see Stacy.

37:40.634 --> 37:41.717
Okay.

37:42.719 --> 37:49.308
That's it, "okay"? No name-calling?
No squawking, no rending of garments?

37:49.434 --> 37:51.310
I like this t-shirt.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.816
You lied to me.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.861
If this is about my mom, I...

38:00.987 --> 38:03.447
This is about your lonely,
miserable life.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.324
I'm not miserable.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.745
And as long as there's a gay bar around,
I'm never lonely.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.289
You haven't had
a single visitor except for your dad.

38:12.415 --> 38:17.169
Drugs are great, HIV freed you,
your dad hates you, you're so happy.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.837
Everything's a lie.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.090
You blame yourself
for your mom's death.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.009
You're not trying to have fun,
you're trying to self-destruct.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.388
You wanna kill yourself, fine,
but stop recruiting!

38:35.939 --> 38:38.232
Heard you hit another patient.

38:39.275 --> 38:43.070
Yeah, sure, why not?

38:43.196 --> 38:44.738
He hit me first.

38:44.864 --> 38:48.492
Cuddy didn't mention that.
Let me see.

38:51.955 --> 38:55.624
- I'm the doctor.
- My concern is purely legal.

38:55.750 --> 39:00.212
- Looks okay. Does it hurt?
- A little.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.007
You need some ice.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.432
There's no way
that Mark doesn't know.

39:13.435 --> 39:18.022
- About the smoking.
- He would have said something.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.277
Then he hasn't been near you
in months.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.656
We're fine.

39:29.909 --> 39:33.120
- Can't be easy.
- Stop squirming.

39:41.296 --> 39:45.090
- Why would you lie about this?
- I'm not lying.

39:46.509 --> 39:49.261
I don't care if you're sleeping
with him or not, but you're not, so...

39:49.387 --> 39:52.181
- I am.
- You're lying.

39:53.349 --> 39:56.810
You know when I have sex?
You can smell that on me, too?

39:58.438 --> 40:00.856
The only people who know about
what's going on with me and Mark,

40:00.982 --> 40:03.275
- are me and Mark.
- Well, I just know you.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.201
And I know you.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.578
You're confident, arrogant,
but you're never certain

40:14.704 --> 40:19.333
unless there's a reason to be certain.
One other person knew.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.294
I told you I was seeing Dr Harper,
you can easily get into her office.

40:22.420 --> 40:36.892
You read my file.

40:38.353 --> 40:44.233
The dishes, the concern,
the acting like a human being.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.151
You have...

40:49.197 --> 40:51.323
This whole time,
you've been manipulating me.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.951
You knew that I had an angle
the moment

40:54.077 --> 40:56.495
I poured soap onto a scrub brush.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.624
You could have thrown me out
or ignored me

41:00.750 --> 41:02.000
or found another exterminator.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.211
You didn't
even tell Mark that I kept coming by.

41:04.337 --> 41:07.339
You let this happen
because you wanna be with me.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.386
I don't anymore.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.431
Get out.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.044
I'm sorry.
