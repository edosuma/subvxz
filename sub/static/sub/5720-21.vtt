WEBVTT

00:05.256 --> 00:06.845
You added fish.

00:06.846 --> 00:08.029
DR. SHERMAN: Well, I'm hoping

00:08.031 --> 00:09.952
they have more luck than the plants.

00:09.953 --> 00:14.072
I couldn't seem to keep them alive.

00:14.073 --> 00:16.952
ELIZABETH: We tried a fish tank
when the kids were little,

00:16.953 --> 00:20.742
but I just kept overfeeding him.

00:20.743 --> 00:23.921
Everything sounds like a
metaphor in here, doesn't it?

00:27.323 --> 00:28.322
Anyway...

00:28.323 --> 00:29.862
It's good to see you.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.782
It's good to meet you, Henry.

00:31.783 --> 00:32.883
You, too, Dr. Sherman.

00:36.823 --> 00:38.513
Well, um...

00:42.243 --> 00:44.662
Like I said on the voice mail,

00:44.663 --> 00:47.782
I thought that maybe we could
use one of my tune-up sessions

00:47.783 --> 00:49.912
to talk through some of the things

00:49.913 --> 00:51.496
that Henry's been
going through at work.

00:51.497 --> 00:54.572
Affecting things at home, that's on me.

00:54.573 --> 00:56.822
We're not so much about blame here.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.366
Thankfully, Henry has been really open

00:58.367 --> 01:01.862
to giving it a try, so...

01:01.863 --> 01:04.861
We do not need couples therapy.

01:04.863 --> 01:07.282
I-I know you think
it's going to be hooey.

01:07.283 --> 01:08.912
I did, too.

01:08.913 --> 01:12.532
But talking with her
really helped me after Iran.

01:12.533 --> 01:13.952
I know, and I'm grateful for it,

01:13.953 --> 01:15.992
but this is an entirely
different situation.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.202
Is it?

01:17.203 --> 01:19.702
Because you are up half the
night walking the floors.

01:19.703 --> 01:21.322
You-you say the same moment with Dmitri

01:21.323 --> 01:23.912
plays over and over in your head.

01:23.913 --> 01:25.715
- That sounds a lot like
- Okay, what happened

01:25.716 --> 01:27.638
- what I went through.
- in Iran happened to you.

01:27.639 --> 01:29.952
What happened with Dmitri,
what I let happen,

01:29.953 --> 01:31.782
was my doing.

01:31.783 --> 01:32.862
And mine.

01:32.863 --> 01:35.492
Elizabeth, this is not something
you need to worry about.

01:35.493 --> 01:38.742
Can I also say

01:38.743 --> 01:42.362
that it pisses me off a little
that when I'm falling apart,

01:42.363 --> 01:45.032
it's off to the shrink,
but when you're struggling,

01:45.033 --> 01:46.202
you can tough it out.

01:46.203 --> 01:48.085
- What is that?
- I'm not toughing anything out,

01:48.086 --> 01:49.412
I'm just...

01:49.413 --> 01:52.992
You said you think about it
every time you look at me.

01:52.993 --> 01:55.093
How are we supposed to get past that?

01:58.073 --> 01:59.782
Someone I cared about,

01:59.783 --> 02:04.452
someone I promised to keep safe,

02:04.453 --> 02:06.032
ended up losing his life.

02:06.033 --> 02:08.282
Which was due to a
decision I was a part of.

02:08.282 --> 02:11.032
That's a terrible burden
of responsibility.

02:11.032 --> 02:12.492
Goes with the job.

02:12.493 --> 02:16.122
Do you find your jobs

02:16.123 --> 02:18.202
intersect quite a bit?

02:18.203 --> 02:21.492
There's been a shared, um...

02:21.493 --> 02:23.412
goal between our departments, so

02:23.413 --> 02:24.995
- more lately.
- It's very supportive

02:24.996 --> 02:26.362
and collaborative.

02:26.363 --> 02:29.742
Do you find that you're
talking about work at home?

02:29.743 --> 02:32.032
Yeah. I mean, we do
sometimes, I think, so...

02:32.033 --> 02:32.952
Nothing...

02:32.953 --> 02:33.993
I mean, I think we both

02:33.994 --> 02:35.032
out of the ordinary.

02:35.033 --> 02:36.282
know where the boundaries are.

02:36.283 --> 02:40.072
She's not opening up at
all under interrogation?

02:40.073 --> 02:41.322
She's too traumatized.

02:41.323 --> 02:43.912
I think working with a
translator is holding us back.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.282
Well, you have to
establish trust first.

02:46.283 --> 02:47.912
Where do we keep the extra cereal?

02:47.913 --> 02:49.992
Now that you've got the intel on Disah,

02:49.993 --> 02:51.452
where does Hijriyyah go?

02:51.453 --> 02:52.992
Well, we'd like to keep her here,

02:52.993 --> 02:54.856
but that would mean somehow
extending the terms

02:54.857 --> 02:55.862
of her rendition.

02:55.863 --> 02:57.912
Mm, if you need any help...

02:57.913 --> 02:59.912
You don't have to say that.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.742
I do have to say I hate your floss.

03:01.743 --> 03:03.782
How can you deal with this stuff?

03:03.783 --> 03:04.782
It's minty.

03:04.783 --> 03:07.202
If Disah is in Islamabad...

03:07.203 --> 03:10.122
I know, it doesn't
look good for Pakistan.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.412
Harboring our number one enemy?

03:12.413 --> 03:15.912
Right after we talked them
down from a war with India?

03:15.913 --> 03:17.532
How did you guys do that anyway?

03:17.533 --> 03:19.822
Oh, never mind.

03:19.823 --> 03:22.862
I hit my security clearance.

03:22.863 --> 03:24.532
I'd tell you if I could.

03:24.533 --> 03:29.282
I think we might be letting
things take over a bit.

03:29.283 --> 03:33.822
I think you have both
experienced more than your share

03:33.823 --> 03:36.072
of professional trauma.

03:36.073 --> 03:40.452
Not least the bombing Henry
was in just a few months ago.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.282
But I'm not gonna talk about your jobs.

03:43.283 --> 03:45.572
I'm gonna talk about your marriage.

03:45.573 --> 03:48.532
The connection that
brought you together,

03:48.533 --> 03:51.202
that built this empire of two,

03:51.203 --> 03:56.862
the circle of intimacy
that you share, hmm?

03:56.863 --> 03:58.992
I want you both, in the next week,

03:58.993 --> 04:01.032
to find your way back to that circle,

04:01.033 --> 04:05.162
to take refuge in each other.

04:05.163 --> 04:08.992
And that means no work talk at home.

04:08.993 --> 04:13.122
I want you to come back
with, mm... three moments

04:13.123 --> 04:16.322
when you reconnected with
the people that you were

04:16.322 --> 04:18.202
when you first met.

04:18.202 --> 04:22.202
Really try to reconnect
with yourselves, hmm?

04:22.203 --> 04:25.912
Through each other.

04:25.913 --> 04:27.072
Yeah?

04:27.073 --> 04:32.572
Okay, she might have gotten
a little hooey there at the end.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.072
No, it was good.

04:35.073 --> 04:36.013
Yeah?

04:36.014 --> 04:36.952
Yeah, she's right.

04:36.953 --> 04:38.793
We're been needing to
spend more time together,

04:38.794 --> 04:40.793
and if this is what it
takes to make that happen,

04:40.794 --> 04:42.072
I'm in.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.412
Does this mean we're going
to the new shabu-shabu place

04:44.413 --> 04:46.242
tomorrow night?

04:46.243 --> 04:47.346
Is that that Japanese place

04:47.347 --> 04:49.032
where you have to cook your own food?

04:49.033 --> 04:50.492
Isn't that like eating at home?

04:50.493 --> 04:52.316
Okay, now I'm just
reconnecting with your dad.

04:52.317 --> 04:53.492
(chuckles)

04:53.493 --> 04:55.822
I'll tell you what,

04:55.823 --> 04:59.202
you went to my shrink,
you get to pick dinner.

04:59.203 --> 05:00.532
Burgers and bowling.

05:00.533 --> 05:05.242
Ooh, we are going back in time.

05:05.243 --> 05:07.702
Listen, that, uh...

05:07.703 --> 05:10.072
International Coalition
to Counter Violent Extremism

05:10.073 --> 05:11.912
thing tonight, you don't have to go.

05:11.913 --> 05:13.702
Don't be silly, I said I would.

05:13.703 --> 05:15.452
I know, but...

05:15.453 --> 05:19.122
Well, it's not exactly bringing
us back to our circle of two.

05:19.123 --> 05:21.461
That's what burgers
and bowling are for.

05:21.462 --> 05:22.285
(chuckles)

05:22.286 --> 05:24.723
Come on, you know you want
to see me in a tuxedo.

05:26.953 --> 05:27.952
(chuckles)

05:27.953 --> 05:30.843
(engine starts)

05:33.163 --> 05:34.242
PARKER: <i>Drone images show</i>

05:34.243 --> 05:36.122
the I-8 district of Islamabad,

05:36.123 --> 05:38.122
where Jibral Disah is
said to be sheltered,

05:38.123 --> 05:40.162
to be a highly exposed
residential area.

05:40.163 --> 05:43.282
Obviously, we can't do
another bin Laden raid.

05:43.283 --> 05:45.426
The hope is that we'll be
working with the cooperation

05:45.427 --> 05:47.162
of the Pakistani government this time.

05:47.163 --> 05:48.426
Well, given that the Pakastanis

05:48.427 --> 05:51.242
appear to be openly
harboring Jibral Disah...

05:51.243 --> 05:53.282
In the middle of their
own capital, no less.

05:53.283 --> 05:55.322
...I'm not sure we can
count on that cooperation.

05:55.323 --> 05:58.162
Without it, we're looking at
an on-the-ground operation.

05:58.163 --> 05:58.971
At best

05:58.972 --> 06:01.822
risking chaos and noise, but at worst

06:01.823 --> 06:03.046
significant collateral damage.

06:03.047 --> 06:06.492
And Prime Minister
Khoosat getting blamed

06:06.493 --> 06:07.822
for letting the Americans in.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.662
I don't need to explain to any of you

06:09.663 --> 06:11.383
how important it is to
protect our agreement

06:11.384 --> 06:12.807
with the prime minister allowing us

06:12.808 --> 06:14.322
to track Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.

06:14.323 --> 06:16.782
PARKER: Understood, but given
this unique opportunity

06:16.783 --> 06:17.889
to target Disah...

06:17.890 --> 06:19.912
Disah might be enemy number one,

06:19.913 --> 06:23.362
but that agreement is the key
to global nuclear security.

06:23.363 --> 06:25.415
Can't believe I'm saying this,

06:25.416 --> 06:27.709
but Disah might not be
the top priority here.

06:27.710 --> 06:30.303
Are we standing down
then, Mr. President?

06:31.283 --> 06:33.412
The other option, if I may,

06:33.413 --> 06:35.242
is to send in Murphy Station.

06:35.243 --> 06:37.822
Cultivate assets on the ground,

06:37.823 --> 06:39.662
with access to Disah.

06:39.663 --> 06:42.072
Try to bring him down from the inside.

06:42.073 --> 06:45.532
Of course, that's not
without risk either.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.322
Well, I'll sleep a hell of a lot better

06:47.323 --> 06:49.412
knowing that we have
Pakistan on our side on this.

06:49.413 --> 06:50.952
There's a reception tonight

06:50.953 --> 06:55.072
for the International Coalition
to Counter Violent Extremism.

06:55.073 --> 06:59.072
Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Abedi will be there.

06:59.073 --> 07:00.072
Maybe I can

07:00.073 --> 07:02.282
try and bait him.

07:02.283 --> 07:03.452
Feed him disinformation,

07:03.453 --> 07:06.122
see if it gets back to
anyone at Hizb Al-Shahid

07:06.123 --> 07:08.026
and then we'll know for
sure if their government

07:08.027 --> 07:10.242
is collaborating with them at all.

07:10.243 --> 07:12.242
I suppose we can wait 24 hours,

07:12.243 --> 07:14.202
see if it reveals any connections.

07:14.203 --> 07:16.912
If we can't find someone
we trust in Pakistan

07:16.913 --> 07:18.572
to help us take out Disah,

07:18.573 --> 07:21.532
we'll have to send in Murphy Station.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.673
Yes, sir.

07:25.783 --> 07:26.952
You know, I don't suggest

07:26.953 --> 07:28.622
Murphy Station lightly.

07:28.623 --> 07:31.202
No, of course, Ellen.

07:31.203 --> 07:33.303
But it may be the best move we've got.

07:35.323 --> 07:38.282
Oh, hey, Jose, you got a minute?

07:38.283 --> 07:40.072
Sure.

07:40.073 --> 07:41.202
Is that from Otis Beanery?

07:41.203 --> 07:42.282
It's on my dime.

07:42.283 --> 07:43.822
That stuff in the kitchen is swill.

07:43.823 --> 07:45.032
(chuckles)

07:45.033 --> 07:47.202
I wanted to check in with
you about your informant

07:47.203 --> 07:49.782
in Pakistan.

07:49.783 --> 07:51.412
Okay.

07:51.413 --> 07:54.202
He's someone with direct
ties to Hizb Al-Shahid?

07:54.203 --> 07:55.952
Direct? I don't know.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.633
I've got a fixer who's
been working with me

07:57.634 --> 07:58.476
since Afghanistan.

07:58.477 --> 08:01.781
He deals in whatever black
market stuff these groups need:

08:01.783 --> 08:04.532
arms, supplies, foreign currency.

08:04.533 --> 08:05.862
He's in Islamabad now.

08:05.863 --> 08:07.572
If HS is there, he'll know.

08:07.573 --> 08:09.992
He's a reliable source of intel?

08:09.993 --> 08:11.282
If the price is right.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.742
Okay.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.362
Currency exchange,
I can work with that, thanks.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.066
A reception for the
International Coalition

08:18.067 --> 08:22.415
to Counter Violent Extremism,
featuring at least six countries

08:22.416 --> 08:24.526
who openly sponsor violent extremism.

08:24.527 --> 08:26.492
Welcome to 21st century diplomacy.

08:26.493 --> 08:29.452
I just want to know the dress
code for flagrant hypocrisy.

08:29.453 --> 08:31.662
Uh, black tie optional.

08:31.663 --> 08:32.662
Morning, team.

08:32.663 --> 08:34.245
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.645
NADINE: Our first order of business

08:35.669 --> 08:36.914
is tonight's reception

08:36.916 --> 08:41.072
for the International Coalition
to Counter Violent Extremism.

08:41.073 --> 08:43.140
Two words, people: open bar.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.874
ELIZABETH: Oh, love the enthusiasm.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.822
Maybe you can bring it to the
second order of business.

08:47.823 --> 08:49.622
Ah, well, now that
Congress has approved

08:49.623 --> 08:52.072
a new aid package to Pakistan,

08:52.073 --> 08:53.702
we'd like to fast-track
these proposals.

08:53.703 --> 08:54.657
(sniffs)

08:54.658 --> 08:57.452
So, please do get through
these as quickly as you can

08:57.453 --> 08:59.742
and earmark those that
seem worth prioritizing.

08:59.743 --> 09:00.944
JAY: Package was just approved

09:00.968 --> 09:02.712
two days ago... why the rush?

09:02.713 --> 09:05.202
Want to include it
in tonight's reception.

09:05.203 --> 09:09.383
As a show of our commitment
to nonviolent initiatives.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.349
A build-your-own-bear workshop?

09:11.350 --> 09:12.711
MATT: It's hard to get radicalized

09:12.735 --> 09:14.713
if you're making a bow
tie for Mr. Snookums.

09:14.714 --> 09:16.675
Sorry, didn't we just find
out that Hizb Al-Shahid

09:16.699 --> 09:18.540
might be hiding out in Pakistan?

09:18.634 --> 09:20.465
We're still sending
them $2 billion in aid?

09:20.466 --> 09:22.470
There are times, Jay,
when you need to trust

09:22.471 --> 09:24.397
that you're part of a larger picture.

09:27.453 --> 09:29.553
(gunshots)

09:31.913 --> 09:34.173
Oh, not bad, Professor.

09:37.663 --> 09:39.282
Nice!

09:39.283 --> 09:40.282
It's been a while.

09:40.283 --> 09:42.742
Any word on our status?

09:42.743 --> 09:43.875
Are they sending us in?

09:43.876 --> 09:46.361
Had a little chat with the
secretary of state this morning.

09:46.363 --> 09:47.362
Really?

09:47.363 --> 09:49.322
What was that about?

09:49.323 --> 09:50.203
She wanted the rundown

09:50.227 --> 09:52.034
on my informant in Islamabad.

09:52.035 --> 09:54.362
Sounds like she's running
some kind of test on the ground.

09:54.363 --> 09:56.452
As long as they don't trip any wires.

09:56.453 --> 09:59.992
Only order I got was to stand
down until further instructed.

09:59.993 --> 10:01.896
Meanwhile, Disah could be
packing up his caravan

10:01.897 --> 10:03.322
as we speak.

10:03.323 --> 10:05.723
Guess we're gonna have to trust
they know what they're doing.

10:05.747 --> 10:08.532
Being at the mercy of larger
forces is not my happy place.

10:08.533 --> 10:10.014
Hey, guys, I have a dinner to get to.

10:10.038 --> 10:11.595
Are we good for weapons certification?

10:11.596 --> 10:12.937
We're good.

10:12.938 --> 10:14.622
You up for a drink?

10:14.623 --> 10:17.412
You know what? Yeah.

10:17.413 --> 10:19.709
Hey, has anybody seen my other earring?

10:19.710 --> 10:21.202
- This one?
- Mom!

10:21.203 --> 10:22.492
You look stunning.

10:22.493 --> 10:25.322
I do?

10:25.323 --> 10:27.362
Is that silk organza?

10:27.363 --> 10:29.742
I hope so. Yeah.

10:29.743 --> 10:30.992
I love it.

10:30.993 --> 10:33.072
ELIZABETH: Listen,
I really need my other earring.

10:33.073 --> 10:35.115
- I think I may have seen it somewhere.
- Go get it.

10:35.116 --> 10:38.822
Ali! Grr!

10:38.823 --> 10:41.952
Oh, gosh, that smells so much
better than the rubber chicken

10:41.953 --> 10:43.412
I'm about to eat.

10:43.413 --> 10:45.492
I can make you up a
plate before you go.

10:45.493 --> 10:46.598
(cell phone buzzing)

10:46.599 --> 10:47.803
Uh...

10:50.703 --> 10:52.952
Hey, where are you?
I got to leave in ten.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.176
HENRY: Babe, I'm really sorry,

10:54.177 --> 10:55.992
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it.

10:55.993 --> 10:56.992
Well, what's going on?

10:56.993 --> 10:58.322
Everything okay?

10:58.323 --> 10:59.884
Yeah, we're just really digging in here

10:59.908 --> 11:01.491
in case we got sent into the field.

11:01.493 --> 11:03.124
There's a lot to prepare.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.245
No, no, I understand.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.241
I was just...

11:06.243 --> 11:07.742
Is that, um...

11:07.743 --> 11:08.912
I mean, is that everything?

11:08.913 --> 11:10.572
Of course.

11:10.573 --> 11:13.952
Uh, if we wrap it up early,
I'll... I'll try to stop by.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.362
Okay.

11:15.363 --> 11:17.202
I really hope you can make it.

11:17.203 --> 11:18.622
Me, too.

11:18.623 --> 11:19.782
I'm really sorry.

11:19.783 --> 11:22.412
Don't work too hard.

11:22.413 --> 11:23.923
Okay, bye.

11:44.744 --> 11:45.743
Russia's here.

11:45.744 --> 11:47.333
Why is Russia here?

11:47.334 --> 11:49.333
'Cause they hate ISIS as much as we do.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.743
Holy crap, have you tried this?

11:50.744 --> 11:51.743
I would like to.

11:51.744 --> 11:52.690
What Russia's doing to Ukraine

11:52.691 --> 11:54.689
totally qualifies as
state-sponsored terrorism.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.588
They should not be
eating our crab puffs.

11:56.589 --> 11:58.543
If crab puffs bring world peace,

11:58.544 --> 12:00.253
then I'm all for sharing.

12:00.254 --> 12:01.423
This whole thing's a joke.

12:01.424 --> 12:02.843
I don't know.

12:02.844 --> 12:04.867
Those proposals for Pakistan
looked pretty awesome.

12:04.868 --> 12:06.753
Uh, what was that?

12:06.754 --> 12:09.923
Sounds suspiciously
like earnest optimism.

12:09.924 --> 12:11.503
I just think Pakistan could benefit

12:11.504 --> 12:14.043
from more than the usual
blank check from the U.S.

12:14.044 --> 12:15.747
You know, get in there
at the ground level,

12:15.748 --> 12:18.093
really make a difference.

12:18.094 --> 12:19.009
(laughing)

12:19.010 --> 12:19.923
It's cool, it's cool.

12:19.924 --> 12:21.713
Wow, faith in the system.

12:21.714 --> 12:22.904
How bracing.

12:24.174 --> 12:26.343
Madam Secretary.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.173
Foreign Minister Abedi
would like a word.

12:28.174 --> 12:29.173
Of course.

12:29.174 --> 12:30.557
You'll excuse me, Your Excellency.

12:30.558 --> 12:31.753
Of course.

12:31.754 --> 12:32.924
Madam Secretary.

12:32.925 --> 12:34.093
Minister Abedi.

12:34.094 --> 12:35.253
Thank you for coming.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.673
It's an honor to have you here.

12:36.674 --> 12:38.303
I know it was short notice.

12:38.304 --> 12:40.608
Well, after receiving notice
of your generous aid package,

12:40.609 --> 12:42.923
I was all too pleased to express
our gratitude in person.

12:42.924 --> 12:47.093
Well, we have many promising
initiatives in the works.

12:47.094 --> 12:48.923
While you're here,

12:48.924 --> 12:51.713
there was a small matter I was
hoping to discuss with you.

12:51.714 --> 12:53.093
Of course.

12:53.094 --> 12:55.423
Great.

12:55.424 --> 12:58.843
At that point, it was either get
the intel however we could

12:58.844 --> 13:01.253
or let the kid go home and
blow the whole operation.

13:01.254 --> 13:02.253
How old was he?

13:02.254 --> 13:04.423
Maybe 12?

13:04.424 --> 13:06.253
So he's got this goat with him,

13:06.254 --> 13:08.253
and I figure this is an easy move.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.503
We cut the goat's throat, tell
him he'll be next or whatever.

13:11.504 --> 13:12.923
It's a goat, right?

13:12.924 --> 13:14.923
He probably had one
for dinner last Sunday.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.886
- The kid lost it.
- Like you wouldn't believe.

13:16.887 --> 13:19.303
The goat's a symbol
of Abraham sacrificing

13:19.304 --> 13:20.883
his son Isaac to God.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.627
It's a big deal in
the Qur'an and the Bible.

13:22.628 --> 13:23.883
Yeah, I didn't know that.

13:23.884 --> 13:26.107
But you'd have thought I sliced
open his mother's throat

13:26.108 --> 13:28.303
the way he was crying.

13:28.304 --> 13:30.303
Not a lot keeps me up at night,

13:30.304 --> 13:31.883
but that one...

13:31.884 --> 13:33.093
Yeah.

13:33.094 --> 13:36.713
Think this should be my last one.

13:36.714 --> 13:39.343
I want you to know I've got your back.

13:39.344 --> 13:41.343
It's gonna be an easy op.

13:41.344 --> 13:43.753
I'm not a total lamb, Jose, but thanks.

13:43.754 --> 13:45.383
Yeah? Okay.

13:45.384 --> 13:48.963
I know you've flown
overhead, 20,000 feet.

13:48.964 --> 13:51.444
Being on the ground is
a whole other game.

13:53.094 --> 13:55.253
I'll tell you my number-one rule,

13:55.254 --> 13:58.253
how I made it home from
every mission I've been on.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.253
No acts of passion. Ever.

14:01.254 --> 14:03.253
You find yourself wanting
to save somebody,

14:03.254 --> 14:05.343
take a big risk that
wasn't part of the plan,

14:05.344 --> 14:07.253
don't do it.

14:07.254 --> 14:11.274
We're way more useful alive
than a star on the wall.

14:13.924 --> 14:16.343
I don't think we lost
Mimi because of passion.

14:16.344 --> 14:20.543
Hey, man, I... I'm sorry
I rode you hard on Mimi.

14:20.544 --> 14:23.963
Nobody knew that guy'd
be wired to blow.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.314
The truth is, I might
have made the same call.

14:30.844 --> 14:32.213
Maybe I'll have one more.

14:32.214 --> 14:33.214
You want one?

14:33.215 --> 14:34.213
Sure.

14:34.214 --> 14:38.213
As you know, we've been
tracking Hizb Al-Shahid

14:38.214 --> 14:40.253
as closely as we can since the attack.

14:40.254 --> 14:44.213
This attack was an affront to us all.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.593
Thank you.

14:45.594 --> 14:50.213
So we've been focusing on
the source of HS's funding,

14:50.214 --> 14:55.003
and unfortunately some
new intel has traced

14:55.004 --> 14:57.854
several private accounts
back to Islamabad.

15:00.254 --> 15:01.843
This is very disappointing to hear.

15:01.844 --> 15:04.423
I'm hoping to get your help
to close these accounts

15:04.424 --> 15:06.093
as quickly as possible.

15:06.094 --> 15:09.343
Of course. The prime minister
has made it a top priority

15:09.344 --> 15:12.343
to root out all ties
to radicalism in Pakistan.

15:12.344 --> 15:16.343
I know that he will be very
concerned to hear this.

15:16.344 --> 15:19.343
My staff will give you all
the information we have.

15:19.344 --> 15:21.173
This is a huge help, Minister.

15:21.174 --> 15:22.343
Thank you so much.

15:22.344 --> 15:24.354
It's the reason we're
all here, isn't it?

15:32.384 --> 15:35.383
(coins rattling on floor)

15:35.384 --> 15:37.644
That was quite a strategy meeting.

15:41.594 --> 15:45.423
There was beer... and-and strategy.

15:45.424 --> 15:47.593
Uh, I'm getting a little whiskey, too.

15:47.594 --> 15:50.423
Oh, I took an Uber.

15:50.424 --> 15:52.593
How was the thing?

15:52.594 --> 15:55.593
You know, just a thing.

15:55.594 --> 15:57.694
Sorry I didn't make it.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.604
Baby, I lied.

16:05.304 --> 16:07.133
I didn't have to work.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.213
I told you you didn't have to go.

16:09.214 --> 16:12.803
I was about to leave,
then I just... I...

16:12.804 --> 16:15.383
I-I... I thought if I ran
into some Russian minister

16:15.384 --> 16:17.383
who was eating caviar
on the U.S.'s dime,

16:17.384 --> 16:18.883
I would throw him against the wall

16:18.884 --> 16:21.673
and demand to know what
they're doing with Talia Petrov.

16:21.674 --> 16:24.543
Well, why didn't you just
tell me that when you called?

16:24.544 --> 16:28.133
Uh, I... I didn't know that was it.

16:28.134 --> 16:29.713
(sighs)

16:29.714 --> 16:31.543
I didn't want to face it.

16:31.544 --> 16:33.234
Then say that.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.463
Any of that.

16:36.464 --> 16:39.963
We're... we're in therapy
so we can work through it.

16:39.964 --> 16:43.543
We're in therapy because I can't
accept what happened to Dmitri

16:43.544 --> 16:45.524
and what's still
happening to his sister.

16:46.634 --> 16:48.923
Which means that you
can't accept me either.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.383
Hey, come on.

16:52.384 --> 16:54.253
I'm scared, Henry.

16:54.254 --> 16:56.843
Listen.

16:56.844 --> 17:00.423
Tomorrow we're gonna go out
to dinner like we planned.

17:00.424 --> 17:04.883
And then we're gonna
take shelter in our...

17:04.884 --> 17:06.502
our culture...

17:06.503 --> 17:07.502
Circle.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.523
Circle of two.

17:11.044 --> 17:12.633
I'm sorry about tonight.

17:12.634 --> 17:15.944
I... I'm getting through it.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.523
But I'm not going anywhere.

17:26.634 --> 17:28.042
Definitely some whiskey.

17:28.044 --> 17:29.463
Okay, yeah, I'll go brush.

17:29.464 --> 17:31.564
- (chuckles)
- I'll brush 'em.

17:34.634 --> 17:37.173
♪ ♪

17:37.174 --> 17:38.753
Nadine.

17:38.754 --> 17:40.963
Hey.

17:40.964 --> 17:42.463
Nice suit.

17:42.464 --> 17:43.463
Thank you.

17:43.464 --> 17:44.463
Is that the right word?

17:44.464 --> 17:45.463
Uh, that works.

17:45.464 --> 17:46.154
Can I help you?

17:46.155 --> 17:46.843
I'm sorry.

17:46.844 --> 17:48.043
I'm a little jangly.

17:48.044 --> 17:49.633
I got home kind of
late after the thing,

17:49.634 --> 17:52.097
and then I was up the rest of
the night putting this together.

17:52.098 --> 17:54.513
You asked us to...
to, uh, pick the proposals

17:54.514 --> 17:56.593
that we liked for the aid
package to Pakistan.

17:56.594 --> 17:58.596
- Yes.
- This one really jumped out at me.

17:58.597 --> 18:02.423
Okay, it's, um, it's a plan
to create community gardens

18:02.424 --> 18:04.593
and, uh, parks for the tribal areas.

18:04.594 --> 18:06.013
Here, check this out.

18:06.014 --> 18:09.053
You can do fruit trees
or, uh, decorative plants.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.593
Ah, this one's a meditation garden.

18:11.594 --> 18:13.593
Mmm, that's lovely.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.593
You'll have to enumerate how
this counters violent extremism.

18:16.594 --> 18:17.803
Page seven.

18:17.804 --> 18:19.803
Benefits health, uh, fosters community,

18:19.804 --> 18:21.326
- Hi.
- encourages youth participation.

18:21.327 --> 18:22.172
Good morning.

18:22.173 --> 18:23.344
- Morning, ma'am.
- Good morning, Madam Secretary.

18:23.345 --> 18:24.608
Hey, we're all here early, huh?

18:24.609 --> 18:27.183
NADINE: This looks very promising.

18:27.184 --> 18:28.824
Why don't you take the lead
and present it to the secretary?

18:28.825 --> 18:29.640
Awesome. Thank you.

18:29.641 --> 18:30.643
- Thank you.
- Okay.

18:30.644 --> 18:32.480
And that is a really great suit.

18:32.481 --> 18:33.904
- Thank you.
- I mean, it suits you.

18:33.905 --> 18:34.480
Good morning.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.770
ELIZABETH: Morning.

18:35.771 --> 18:37.994
Did somebody put rocket
fuel in Matt's coffee?

18:37.995 --> 18:39.663
I'll look into that.

18:39.664 --> 18:41.083
Not really. I don't care.

18:41.084 --> 18:42.833
Here's a copy of your schedule.

18:42.834 --> 18:43.794
And, uh, I just got word

18:43.795 --> 18:45.435
that Murphy Station
would like to see you.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.913
See me? Not just a call?

18:46.914 --> 18:49.033
MATT: Madam Secretary, um,

18:49.034 --> 18:50.623
I want to put this on
the-the morning agenda.

18:50.624 --> 18:52.036
- I think it's really...
- Yeah, you know, Matt,

18:52.037 --> 18:54.203
I think we're gonna have
to push the morning meeting.

18:54.204 --> 18:55.867
Um, tell the guys I'll
be right back down.

18:55.868 --> 18:56.968
Yes, ma'am.

18:58.954 --> 19:01.493
♪ ♪

19:01.494 --> 19:03.493
JOSE: <i>I don't know
what you said last night,</i>

19:03.494 --> 19:05.913
but it definitely got a reaction.

19:05.914 --> 19:09.033
My fixer says HS reached out
to him early this morning,

19:09.034 --> 19:11.623
looking to empty several bank accounts,

19:11.624 --> 19:14.203
move the cash back to Libya.

19:14.204 --> 19:16.413
Wow, that fast.

19:16.414 --> 19:17.917
Sounds like a pretty close connection

19:17.918 --> 19:20.413
between Hizb Al-Shahid
and, uh... Who was it?

19:20.414 --> 19:24.623
The foreign minister of Pakistan.

19:24.624 --> 19:28.873
He said he'd tell the prime
minister right after we spoke.

19:28.874 --> 19:31.533
(sighs) So it goes
all the way to the top.

19:31.534 --> 19:32.953
Possibly.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.953
Good news is we made contact,
so we can get to work.

19:35.954 --> 19:38.123
The bad news is it doesn't
look like we'll be getting

19:38.124 --> 19:39.793
any help from the government.

19:39.794 --> 19:41.634
That is bad news.

19:42.624 --> 19:44.623
So are we going in?

19:44.624 --> 19:48.203
DALTON: We'll give Murphy
Station a diplomatic cover,

19:48.204 --> 19:51.203
have them work from inside the embassy,

19:51.204 --> 19:54.413
using operatives we already
have on the ground.

19:54.414 --> 19:57.293
They can poison Disah's food,

19:57.294 --> 20:00.033
or get a messenger to bring a gun in

20:00.034 --> 20:02.333
with the weekly groceries,

20:02.334 --> 20:05.413
but I want him taken out fast,

20:05.414 --> 20:07.533
with nothing to trace it back to us.

20:07.534 --> 20:10.014
I'll dispatch orders.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.159
I get giving private
aid to radical groups.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.158
I mean, I don't like it, but...

20:30.159 --> 20:31.998
Saudi Arabia does it,

20:31.999 --> 20:35.440
Pakistanis have given
aid to the Taliban.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.021
But official collaboration
with terrorists,

20:39.022 --> 20:41.310
right up to the prime minister?

20:41.311 --> 20:43.516
It's like giving
protection money to the mob,

20:43.517 --> 20:45.355
pay them so they don't turn on you.

20:45.356 --> 20:47.855
At the expense of... of all the aid

20:47.856 --> 20:49.935
and-and support we've given them?

20:49.936 --> 20:52.986
We're right in the middle
of negotiating a free trade deal

20:52.987 --> 20:55.435
and debt cancellation.

20:55.436 --> 20:59.395
Why jeopardize that by

20:59.396 --> 21:03.185
getting into bed with jihadists
who want to destroy us? Just...

21:03.186 --> 21:04.975
You're trying to use
logic to understand

21:04.976 --> 21:07.975
how radical ideology can exert itself

21:07.976 --> 21:09.515
to the point where ethical

21:09.516 --> 21:11.645
and moral structures become threatened.

21:11.646 --> 21:12.565
Logic does not apply.

21:12.566 --> 21:14.895
That's not comforting, like,

21:14.896 --> 21:16.855
at all.

21:16.856 --> 21:19.275
You know, it's a diplomatic cover.

21:19.276 --> 21:22.996
You should take a suit.

21:27.726 --> 21:30.775
We're doing it again, aren't we?

21:30.776 --> 21:32.975
Well, I just thought,
under the circumstances,

21:32.976 --> 21:34.826
maybe we get a pass for talking shop.

21:38.896 --> 21:40.815
You can tell me not to go, you know.

21:40.816 --> 21:42.895
I'll let Jose and Jane handle it.

21:42.896 --> 21:45.975
I say this with love.

21:45.976 --> 21:48.725
That's such a load of crap,
and you know it.

21:48.726 --> 21:50.225
Mmm. Mmm.

21:50.226 --> 21:54.046
You're racked with guilt
over a horrible loss,

21:54.047 --> 21:55.684
and you're Catholic to boot.

21:55.685 --> 21:57.975
Now you get a chance to atone
by going into the lion's den

21:57.976 --> 21:59.225
and slaying the dragon.

21:59.226 --> 22:00.868
- It's a mixed metaphor.
- Mixed metaphor.

22:00.869 --> 22:03.015
I know that, but you know what I mean.

22:03.016 --> 22:04.855
We both know you're going.

22:04.856 --> 22:08.774
Listen, this is not just some
kind of personal crusade.

22:08.775 --> 22:09.780
I know that.

22:09.781 --> 22:12.062
And you know I would never
purposely put myself in danger.

22:12.086 --> 22:15.685
Conrad wants you guys working
from inside the embassy,

22:15.686 --> 22:17.935
and that's what's gonna
let me sleep at night,

22:17.936 --> 22:20.815
so... tell me you're
gonna respect that.

22:20.816 --> 22:22.666
Of course.

22:24.726 --> 22:27.597
We didn't get to our therapy homework.

22:27.598 --> 22:28.855
(sighs)

22:28.856 --> 22:31.975
Burgers and bowling the
second I get back, and

22:31.976 --> 22:35.105
what's the cover story
with the kids again?

22:35.106 --> 22:37.975
Jace, Stevie,
come say good-bye to your dad.

22:39.037 --> 22:40.548
STEVIE: When are you back?

22:40.549 --> 22:41.775
Sunday at this point,

22:41.776 --> 22:43.565
but it could go a little later.

22:43.566 --> 22:45.826
Oh, right, because a weekend with

22:45.827 --> 22:46.804
- a think tank
- Bye.

22:46.805 --> 22:48.565
in San Diego could
totally run into overtime.

22:48.566 --> 22:50.315
Oh, there's my little
conspiracy theorist.

22:50.316 --> 22:52.725
Wherever you're going,
have a wonderful time.

22:52.726 --> 22:54.685
A small break from the texting, please?

22:54.686 --> 22:56.566
- Sorry. See you Sunday.
- Bye.

22:56.567 --> 22:57.275
Mwah!

22:57.276 --> 22:59.903
You do realize it's
psychologically damaging

22:59.904 --> 23:01.281
to grow up in a false reality?

23:01.282 --> 23:03.861
I'll remember that next time
you ask me for an Oculus Rift.

23:04.030 --> 23:06.242
Oh, walked right into that one!

23:06.243 --> 23:07.786
(both chuckle)

23:11.686 --> 23:13.725
(clears throat)

23:13.726 --> 23:15.355
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

23:15.356 --> 23:18.105
I-I need M Sec's eye line
for my presentation.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.895
And this is my spot.

23:20.896 --> 23:22.065
I know.

23:22.066 --> 23:24.815
Could you just shake it up a little?

23:24.816 --> 23:26.685
I've got visual aids.

23:26.686 --> 23:27.731
And this is my spot.

23:27.732 --> 23:28.775
Oh, goodie.

23:28.776 --> 23:31.725
Weirdly obsessive versus
blind creature of habit.

23:31.726 --> 23:33.855
My money's on weirdly obsessive.

23:33.856 --> 23:34.959
I have to root for my team.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.275
Good morning, everyone.

23:36.276 --> 23:37.316
- Morning.
- Good morning.

23:37.317 --> 23:38.540
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

23:38.541 --> 23:39.775
Oh, gosh.

23:39.776 --> 23:41.475
Well, thank you. These are lovely.

23:41.476 --> 23:42.605
It's for my presentation.

23:42.606 --> 23:43.895
You'll see in a minute.

23:43.896 --> 23:45.855
NADINE: Oh, there's been a slight

23:45.856 --> 23:48.015
change to the morning's agenda.

23:48.016 --> 23:50.815
Yes, uh, first, I want
to thank all of you

23:50.816 --> 23:53.355
for putting together those
proposals for Pakistan

23:53.356 --> 23:55.475
on such short notice.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.935
The foreign minister
was deeply impressed.

23:58.936 --> 24:00.435
However,

24:00.436 --> 24:02.815
some new developments
have put the congressional

24:02.816 --> 24:04.725
aid package on hold for the time being.

24:04.726 --> 24:07.275
Possibly permanently.

24:07.276 --> 24:10.645
The situation on the
ground has changed...

24:12.085 --> 24:13.475
Matt?

24:13.476 --> 24:14.895
Is there a problem?

24:14.896 --> 24:16.935
Uh, no, I-I'm sorry.

24:16.936 --> 24:18.935
ELIZABETH: I-I know
this is frustrating.

24:18.936 --> 24:20.275
And I apologize.

24:20.276 --> 24:21.671
Obviously, as soon as...

24:21.672 --> 24:23.065
BLAKE: Of course. Ma'am?

24:23.066 --> 24:24.605
Call from the embassy in Islamabad.

24:24.606 --> 24:26.815
Oh, um, excuse me. I got to take this.

24:26.816 --> 24:29.975
Moving on to the arrival
of the Kurdish delegation...

24:29.976 --> 24:32.576
♪ ♪

24:35.476 --> 24:37.515
ELIZABETH: So you made it.
How's it going?

24:37.516 --> 24:39.059
Well, the mosques are just incredible.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.935
The whole city's getting ready

24:40.936 --> 24:42.895
for a big military parade tomorrow.

24:42.896 --> 24:46.565
Which will look beautiful from
the windows of the embassy.

24:46.566 --> 24:48.185
(chuckles) Jane and I are shut up

24:48.186 --> 24:50.475
in here like a harem.

24:50.476 --> 24:52.015
Jose's out meeting his fixer.

24:52.016 --> 24:54.275
He wants to sell HS some burner phones.

24:54.276 --> 24:56.435
There's a tracking
device in one of them.

24:56.436 --> 24:58.379
Once it goes live,
we'll know Disah's every move.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.815
Yeah, if it goes live.

24:59.816 --> 25:02.015
And then you're
handing over all that intel

25:02.016 --> 25:03.605
to the ops team on the ground?

25:03.606 --> 25:04.895
Okay. (chuckles)

25:04.896 --> 25:06.895
Now we're just repeating
briefings to each other.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.355
This isn't even creative work talk.

25:09.356 --> 25:11.499
I just want to hear verbal
conformation about the part

25:11.500 --> 25:12.685
where all the work

25:12.686 --> 25:16.105
of actually taking Disah
out is done by...

25:16.106 --> 25:17.895
The ops team.

25:17.896 --> 25:19.315
Verbally confirmed.

25:19.316 --> 25:20.855
You get any sleep?

25:20.856 --> 25:22.315
A little.

25:22.316 --> 25:23.416
You?

25:23.417 --> 25:24.515
Not much.

25:24.516 --> 25:26.228
- JOSE: Tell me you got the tracking up!
- Hang on, Jose's back.

25:26.229 --> 25:27.855
Just established a connection.

25:27.856 --> 25:29.066
HS bought the phones already?

25:29.067 --> 25:30.275
Who's that?

25:30.276 --> 25:32.355
Uh, I'm putting you on speaker.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.275
This is the secretary of state, Jose.

25:34.276 --> 25:36.065
<i>What's going on?</i>

25:36.066 --> 25:37.895
My fixer just heard
from his HS contact.

25:37.896 --> 25:40.275
They want to buy some
military-grade EFPs.

25:40.276 --> 25:41.855
Whoa.

25:41.856 --> 25:43.475
That's a roadside bomb, right?

25:43.476 --> 25:44.855
An incredibly badass one.

25:44.856 --> 25:47.225
Basically, it's a pipe filled
with any kind of explosive

25:47.226 --> 25:49.855
that can shoot a copper slug
hard enough to penetrate armor.

25:49.856 --> 25:50.855
It's heavy-duty damage.

25:50.856 --> 25:52.542
Do we know what their target is?

25:52.543 --> 25:54.015
No, but some upper-level HS lieutenants

25:54.016 --> 25:55.119
are meeting him in an hour.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.395
We'll get eyes on the purchase.

25:56.396 --> 25:58.259
Hopefully, they'll follow
these guys right back

25:58.260 --> 26:00.148
- to their base of operation.
- Nice play.

26:00.149 --> 26:01.041
Got lucky.

26:01.042 --> 26:01.935
Oh, now he's modest.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.515
Hang on a sec.

26:03.516 --> 26:07.015
What does HS want with
explosives in Pakistan?

26:07.016 --> 26:08.815
Exactly. This is not the kind of thing

26:08.816 --> 26:10.815
you want to go bouncing
around on dirt roads with.

26:10.816 --> 26:13.975
Why would they want to
target anything in Pakistan,

26:13.976 --> 26:16.135
the one country that gives
them support and shelter?

26:16.297 --> 26:18.145
All I know is, I have less
than an hour to set this up.

26:18.146 --> 26:19.895
You guys want to think this to death,

26:19.896 --> 26:22.608
- you let me know what you come up with.
- I'll keep you posted.

26:22.609 --> 26:24.395
Thanks.

26:24.396 --> 26:25.975
I'll fill in the White House.

26:25.976 --> 26:28.076
Bye.

26:29.976 --> 26:31.815
(knocking)

26:31.816 --> 26:34.435
Do you have a minute?

26:34.436 --> 26:36.105
Oh, I don't know.

26:36.106 --> 26:39.475
I'm pretty busy canceling
projects for no good reason.

26:39.476 --> 26:44.145
I am so sorry a-about reacting.

26:44.146 --> 26:47.435
I'm not the one you need
to apologize to, but thank you.

26:47.436 --> 26:49.826
I'll also apologize to the secretary.

26:53.066 --> 26:56.315
You know, my job is to write
things for other people,

26:56.316 --> 26:58.105
which... which I love, you know,

26:58.106 --> 27:00.015
and I think I'm pretty good at.

27:00.016 --> 27:01.275
I would agree.

27:01.276 --> 27:02.975
But it's like being a songwriter

27:02.976 --> 27:05.065
in Nashville.

27:05.066 --> 27:07.315
There's always someone
else singing my song.

27:07.316 --> 27:10.395
Sometimes... I just
want to sing my own.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.065
And, um,

27:13.066 --> 27:16.975
a gardening project in
Pakistan is your song?

27:16.976 --> 27:20.185
(sighs)

27:20.186 --> 27:23.105
My mom was born in Karachi.

27:23.106 --> 27:24.935
I'm half Pakistani.

27:24.936 --> 27:29.105
I'm sure you thought I was
Sephardic Jew or half Sicilian?

27:29.106 --> 27:30.311
I...

27:30.312 --> 27:31.515
My mom came here

27:31.516 --> 27:34.395
when she was 16 to get
away from her family,

27:34.396 --> 27:36.565
and she never went back.

27:36.566 --> 27:39.105
When I ask her to tell me

27:39.106 --> 27:42.975
what she remembers about
growing up in Karachi,

27:42.976 --> 27:45.645
she always says two things:

27:45.646 --> 27:48.975
a song this <i>sabzi wala</i> used to sing

27:48.976 --> 27:52.185
while selling vegetables on the street,

27:52.186 --> 27:56.645
and the smell of Arabian jasmine
in her family's garden.

27:56.646 --> 27:59.355
She came here to get an education,

27:59.356 --> 28:02.225
and met my dad, built this whole life

28:02.226 --> 28:04.315
for herself, but to this day,

28:04.316 --> 28:07.826
she still calls Pakistan home,
you know?

28:11.186 --> 28:13.515
And I... (sighs)

28:13.516 --> 28:17.326
You wanted to restore a
world your mother lost?

28:21.016 --> 28:23.645
(sighs)

28:23.646 --> 28:25.725
Obviously,

28:25.726 --> 28:29.685
I tried to bring too much
of myself to the job,

28:29.686 --> 28:32.286
and I'm sorry.

28:34.476 --> 28:37.286
It won't happen again.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.725
Go ahead, Murphy Station.
What's your progress?

28:42.726 --> 28:44.895
Mr. President, we've been
actively tracking a purchase

28:44.896 --> 28:46.645
of explosives by two
high-ranking members

28:46.646 --> 28:48.015
of Hizb Al-Shahid.

28:48.016 --> 28:50.119
When our operatives followed
them after the purchase,

28:50.120 --> 28:52.515
we got something we weren't expecting.

28:52.516 --> 28:55.065
Okay. These are the two
lieutenants of Disah

28:55.066 --> 28:56.775
just after the purchase of the EFPs.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.185
Now, this is a highly lethal

28:59.186 --> 29:01.975
roadside bomb that can
penetrate an armored vehicle.

29:01.976 --> 29:04.145
Frequently employed
against U.S. troops in Iraq.

29:04.146 --> 29:06.475
Where the hell is this
fixer getting an EFP?

29:06.476 --> 29:08.685
Most likely Iranian military.

29:08.686 --> 29:09.975
They make deals.

29:09.976 --> 29:11.775
Resourceful.

29:11.776 --> 29:13.225
Where are they going?

29:13.226 --> 29:14.605
Tomorrow is a national holiday

29:14.606 --> 29:16.185
commemorating the Lahore Resolution.

29:16.186 --> 29:18.315
Prime Minister Khoosat will be riding

29:18.316 --> 29:20.435
through the streets in a parade.

29:20.436 --> 29:22.395
And these are the
members of HS planting

29:22.396 --> 29:24.139
an EFP on the prime
minister's parade route.

29:24.140 --> 29:25.395
DALTON: You're telling me

29:25.396 --> 29:26.895
Hizb Al-Shahid is planning an attack

29:26.896 --> 29:28.145
on the head of the country

29:28.146 --> 29:29.515
offering them shelter and aid?

29:29.516 --> 29:30.647
JOSE: That appears

29:30.648 --> 29:31.514
to be the case.

29:31.515 --> 29:33.076
ELIZABETH: Can you
send us a secure link

29:33.100 --> 29:34.200
to this video, please?

29:34.201 --> 29:35.341
FELLOWS: Of course.

29:35.342 --> 29:38.159
Sir, we'll have to disarm
that EFP as soon as possible.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.315
We'll get a team on it.

29:39.316 --> 29:41.355
Await further instructions.
We'll be in touch.

29:41.356 --> 29:43.015
WARE: What the hell is

29:43.016 --> 29:44.315
Hizb Al-Shahid doing?

29:44.316 --> 29:45.605
We can't wait to figure it out.

29:45.606 --> 29:47.725
We've got to warn Khoosat
and get him to safety.

29:47.726 --> 29:49.225
HILL: With respect, sir,

29:49.226 --> 29:52.435
is showing our hand the best
course of action at this point?

29:52.436 --> 29:54.775
Maybe we don't have
to show our entire hand,

29:54.776 --> 29:57.565
but we cannot risk
an attack on Khoosat.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.855
This terrorist group already
infiltrated the United States

29:59.856 --> 30:01.275
with a dirty bomb.

30:01.276 --> 30:05.105
If Pakistan falls to them,
it's everyone's worst nightmare:

30:05.106 --> 30:07.331
nuclear weapons in the
hands of jihadists

30:07.332 --> 30:09.636
with no hesitation to use them.

30:16.799 --> 30:19.258
You must forgive me for not
calling first to thank you

30:19.259 --> 30:21.758
for your extremely generous
support, Mr. President.

30:21.759 --> 30:24.838
This is not a call about our
aid package, Prime Minister.

30:24.839 --> 30:26.298
This is a warning.

30:26.299 --> 30:29.168
We know Pakistan is
harboring Jibral Disah

30:29.169 --> 30:31.267
and members of Hizb Al-Shahid.

30:31.268 --> 30:33.668
Um, excuse me?

30:33.669 --> 30:36.798
We have indisputable
proof that Jibral Disah

30:36.799 --> 30:39.798
and members of Hizb
Al-Shahid are receiving aid

30:39.799 --> 30:41.128
from within your borders,

30:41.129 --> 30:44.378
that, in fact, Disah

30:44.379 --> 30:47.208
is harbored in Islamabad as we speak.

30:47.209 --> 30:49.508
(sighs)

30:49.509 --> 30:53.088
Let me understand.

30:53.089 --> 30:57.508
Against the wishes of every
member of my cabinet,

30:57.509 --> 30:59.468
against the fierce convictions

30:59.469 --> 31:02.088
of virtually every citizen of Pakistan,

31:02.089 --> 31:06.418
I have given the United States
unprecedented access to track

31:06.419 --> 31:08.628
all of our nuclear weapons,
and now you come to me

31:08.629 --> 31:11.508
outraged about what your
additional secret intelligence

31:11.509 --> 31:14.668
inside our borders
supposedly shows you?

31:14.669 --> 31:17.548
Pretending to be shocked that
our countries spy on each other

31:17.549 --> 31:20.088
may not be your best line of
defense here, Prime Minister.

31:20.089 --> 31:22.418
I have no strategy, Conrad.

31:22.419 --> 31:24.708
You know the work I've done
with my administration

31:24.709 --> 31:26.708
to cut our ties to radicalism.

31:26.709 --> 31:29.338
Do not assume, based
on the faults in our past...

31:29.339 --> 31:31.479
I make no assumptions.

31:33.709 --> 31:35.838
These are known operatives of HS

31:35.839 --> 31:38.508
on the streets of Islamabad
about two hours ago.

31:38.509 --> 31:40.798
They're planting explosives
along your parade route.

31:42.152 --> 31:43.838
I'll need proof of their identity.

31:43.839 --> 31:45.838
ELIZABETH: We can provide that.

31:45.839 --> 31:48.338
And you should know, Prime Minister,

31:48.339 --> 31:51.258
I gave coded information

31:51.259 --> 31:53.588
about Hizb Al-Shahid to
your foreign minister

31:53.589 --> 31:55.128
at our state reception.

31:55.129 --> 31:59.628
And after assuring us he would
pass that information on to you,

31:59.629 --> 32:01.968
that information was instead

32:01.969 --> 32:04.468
received by HS in Islamabad,

32:04.469 --> 32:06.628
where they promptly acted on it.

32:06.629 --> 32:08.918
Mr. President, you must believe...

32:08.919 --> 32:11.968
DALTON: It doesn't matter
what you knew or didn't know.

32:11.969 --> 32:13.548
Not now.

32:13.549 --> 32:15.628
What matters is that you stay safe.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.508
For whatever reason, these terrorists

32:18.509 --> 32:21.588
your administration is in bed
with are turning on you.

32:21.589 --> 32:25.708
And if you're not safe, neither
is our nuclear agreement.

32:25.709 --> 32:27.168
(scoffs)

32:27.169 --> 32:30.013
Your concern for my
well-being is... touching.

32:30.014 --> 32:33.008
ELIZABETH: We have a team on the
ground ready to take out Disah.

32:33.009 --> 32:35.668
We politely ask for your help.

32:35.669 --> 32:37.798
Or, even better, do the job yourself.

32:37.799 --> 32:41.668
That means root out all members
of HS and send them packing.

32:41.669 --> 32:43.668
Then get your own house in order.

32:43.669 --> 32:45.668
Madam Secretary,

32:45.669 --> 32:48.128
you say it was my foreign minister

32:48.129 --> 32:49.708
you shared this information with?

32:49.709 --> 32:51.809
Yes.

32:53.589 --> 32:56.708
I thank you for your candor.

32:56.709 --> 33:00.588
Mr. President, Madam Secretary.

33:00.589 --> 33:02.859
(click, beep)

33:04.879 --> 33:08.968
Whatever's going on, I don't
think Khoosat is in on it.

33:08.969 --> 33:12.258
Well, we'll see what
his next moves are,

33:12.259 --> 33:14.439
and let's hope this is the end of it.

33:16.259 --> 33:18.378
Sir.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.418
JOSE: <i>Damn it!</i>

33:20.419 --> 33:21.918
We just lost our eyes.

33:21.919 --> 33:24.418
Our ops team got called off
to cover this damn parade.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.838
(exhales) We really need
that phone to go live.

33:26.839 --> 33:27.758
Guys.

33:27.759 --> 33:30.088
What? What is it?

33:30.089 --> 33:31.588
Something just posted

33:31.589 --> 33:34.668
on the foreign ministry's
Twitter account.

33:34.669 --> 33:36.769
(phone ringing)

33:40.669 --> 33:43.378
I'm here, I'm here.
What is it? Are you okay?

33:43.379 --> 33:44.968
Did Pakistan give the U.S. access

33:44.969 --> 33:46.548
to track its nuclear weapons?

33:46.549 --> 33:47.968
Where did you get that?

33:47.969 --> 33:51.769
The foreign minister just posted
it on his Twitter account.

33:52.709 --> 33:54.468
He did what?

33:54.469 --> 33:56.838
He has pictures of
U.S. nuclear inspectors

33:56.839 --> 33:58.838
at three different bases,
all in the last week.

33:58.839 --> 34:00.841
- Is it true?
- I-I got to call the White House.

34:00.842 --> 34:02.008
Elizabeth.

34:02.009 --> 34:04.088
People are going crazy in the streets.

34:04.089 --> 34:05.299
(glass shattering in distance)

34:05.300 --> 34:06.609
Is it true?

34:07.549 --> 34:09.128
Do you, uh...

34:09.129 --> 34:11.378
do you remember when we
thought the prime minister

34:11.379 --> 34:14.967
might be cooperating
with Hizb Al-Shahid?

34:14.969 --> 34:17.208
All I can say is

34:17.208 --> 34:18.797
we let him know,

34:18.799 --> 34:21.588
and now his foreign
minister just played

34:21.589 --> 34:23.088
his ace.

34:23.089 --> 34:25.507
And it is a really big ace, Henry.

34:25.509 --> 34:27.007
I-I got to go.

34:27.009 --> 34:28.668
I-I'll call you back, okay?

34:28.668 --> 34:30.978
I love you. Bye.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.128
(elevator dings)

34:35.129 --> 34:37.297
(speaking indistinctly)

34:37.299 --> 34:38.967
BLAKE: I'm here. I'm here.

34:38.969 --> 34:40.967
Great. Thanks, everyone.

34:40.969 --> 34:41.917
DAISY: Matt's still

34:41.918 --> 34:43.380
- on his way.
- BLAKE: Regular drip.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.744
- The best I could do.
- Thank you.

34:44.745 --> 34:46.838
What's the latest on the
embassy evacuation?

34:46.839 --> 34:49.838
The first Chinook disembarked
from Shindand Air Base.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.838
It's due to arrive within the hour.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.342
An airlift? Is that really necessary?

34:53.342 --> 34:55.467
The streets are already chaos.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.047
JAY: Here's to social media. Unrest

34:57.049 --> 34:58.130
at the speed of light.

34:58.131 --> 34:59.875
Do we really think the
government will fall?

34:59.876 --> 35:02.168
I mean, they re-stabilized
after the conflict with India.

35:02.169 --> 35:04.258
The only thing worse to
Pakistanis than giving in

35:04.259 --> 35:05.962
to India is giving in
to the United States.

35:05.963 --> 35:07.798
ELIZABETH: Tell Minister
Avdonin I'm ready

35:07.799 --> 35:08.464
for the call.

35:08.465 --> 35:09.128
Yes, ma'am.

35:09.129 --> 35:10.798
ELIZABETH: And try and get Henry!

35:10.799 --> 35:11.798
BLAKE: Yep!

35:11.799 --> 35:13.298
Um...

35:13.299 --> 35:16.128
Why is she calling the
Russian foreign minister?

35:16.129 --> 35:18.128
Render safe mission.

35:18.129 --> 35:20.378
The agreement between
the U.S. and Russia

35:20.379 --> 35:22.128
to secure Pakistan's nuclear arsenal

35:22.129 --> 35:23.588
if the government falters.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.798
Even after everything we've
been through with Russia?

35:25.799 --> 35:28.128
Probably the one thing
that trumps politics.

35:28.129 --> 35:31.628
If Pakistan's nukes fall
into the hands of radicals,

35:31.629 --> 35:34.628
that's not just a
problem for Pakistan...

35:34.629 --> 35:38.149
that's a problem for humanity.

35:39.709 --> 35:41.519
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

35:43.549 --> 35:45.048
(whirring)

35:45.049 --> 35:46.801
- ELIZABETH: Can you hear me?
- Yeah. Sorry.

35:46.802 --> 35:49.345
- It's a little hectic here.
- There's a Chinook coming for you.

35:49.346 --> 35:51.048
It's-it's due in less than an hour.

35:51.049 --> 35:52.379
We'll be ready.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.708
Listen, Henry,

35:53.709 --> 35:56.132
I know that y-you're gonna want
to help everybody else first,

35:56.133 --> 35:58.798
but... you need to think

35:58.799 --> 36:00.968
of the kids. We need you back.

36:00.969 --> 36:02.338
Let's go! This way!

36:02.339 --> 36:04.008
Hey, you know Becky,

36:04.009 --> 36:07.338
that crazy roommate you had
when you lived on Kimbark?

36:07.339 --> 36:08.838
The Jane Austen girl?

36:08.839 --> 36:10.008
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:10.009 --> 36:12.088
I don't know if you remember,

36:12.089 --> 36:13.838
but the second time I asked you out,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.918
you put me off because you
said Becky invited you

36:15.919 --> 36:18.008
to a <i>Pride and Prejudice </i> ball

36:18.009 --> 36:19.588
and you didn't want to let her down.

36:19.589 --> 36:20.838
You remember that?

36:20.839 --> 36:22.838
Yeah, I remember it,
'cause I went to it.

36:22.839 --> 36:25.168
(chuckles) You did not.

36:25.169 --> 36:28.418
I did. Tom Hodges was
going out with this girl

36:28.419 --> 36:30.482
in the theater department.
She got me a morning coat

36:30.483 --> 36:32.208
and a top hat from <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

36:32.209 --> 36:33.878
Henry.

36:33.879 --> 36:36.569
I learned the quadrille.

36:37.709 --> 36:40.968
How did I not know about
this until just now?

36:40.969 --> 36:42.378
Uh, because you didn't show up.

36:42.379 --> 36:44.298
Because I begged off to write a paper.

36:44.299 --> 36:46.298
Well, I showed up. Looking like...

36:46.299 --> 36:48.968
Oscar Wilde at a pet funeral.

36:48.969 --> 36:50.878
Pictures or it didn't happen.

36:50.879 --> 36:54.048
You're gonna have to
take my word for it.

36:54.049 --> 36:56.838
I will always show up for you.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.939
Always.

37:02.879 --> 37:06.708
Do you think that this counts
as our homework for Dr. Sherman?

37:06.709 --> 37:07.794
JOSE: Henry.

37:07.795 --> 37:08.878
I got to go.

37:08.879 --> 37:10.208
Just got word from the fixer.

37:10.209 --> 37:12.878
I love you.

37:12.879 --> 37:16.088
Disah's using the phone
with the tracker right now.

37:16.089 --> 37:17.588
It went live?

37:17.589 --> 37:18.918
Jane's hooking us back up.

37:18.919 --> 37:20.918
Hopefully we can still get a signal.

37:20.919 --> 37:23.938
Jose, we're evacuating the embassy.

37:23.939 --> 37:26.088
I didn't travel halfway around the world

37:26.089 --> 37:28.529
to get on a chopper the moment
we have this guy in our sights.

37:28.553 --> 37:31.263
Have you looked outside?
This city is falling apart.

37:31.264 --> 37:34.168
Which is the perfect cover
we need to get this done,

37:34.169 --> 37:35.489
like POTUS wants.

37:35.490 --> 37:38.588
We'll evacuate with the
ops team after it's done.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.468
I said I'd get you back, and I will.

37:41.469 --> 37:43.968
You also said never do
anything out of passion.

37:43.969 --> 37:45.378
This isn't passion.

37:45.379 --> 37:48.008
This is finishing the job
we came here to do. You go

37:48.009 --> 37:49.519
if you want. I'm staying with Jane.

37:55.379 --> 37:57.439
(indistinct chatter)

38:09.926 --> 38:12.026
(gunfire, indistinct shouting on TV)

38:14.616 --> 38:15.610
WARE: Sir,

38:15.611 --> 38:17.610
given the increasing civil unrest,

38:17.611 --> 38:19.230
I recommend we move immediately

38:19.231 --> 38:22.900
to secure all nuclear
weapons in Pakistan.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.520
With NNSA's recent inspections,
JSOC will know exactly where

38:25.521 --> 38:27.323
- to go.
- ELIZABETH: I've spoken with Russia.

38:27.324 --> 38:29.690
They're on board and ready
when we say the word.

38:29.691 --> 38:32.280
You know why those people are rioting?

38:32.281 --> 38:34.650
National pride.

38:34.651 --> 38:37.400
The very idea that their prime
minister agreed to allow us

38:37.401 --> 38:40.190
to simply track where their weapons are

38:40.191 --> 38:43.190
is sending them into the
streets demanding his head.

38:43.191 --> 38:44.730
And given the volatility...

38:44.731 --> 38:46.914
Given the volatility, those
people will see our efforts

38:46.915 --> 38:49.320
to secure their arsenal
as nothing less than...

38:49.321 --> 38:51.230
an invasion by a foreign enemy.

38:51.231 --> 38:53.610
We do need to consider
the known collaboration

38:53.611 --> 38:55.520
between members of the
Pakistani Parliament

38:55.521 --> 38:56.318
and HS.

38:56.319 --> 38:58.613
The greater risk is
allowing any of those groups

38:58.614 --> 39:01.520
to gain access to a single warhead.

39:01.521 --> 39:05.320
I'm aware of the risk, Ephraim.

39:05.321 --> 39:07.824
And if I'd truly lost hope that
Khoosat could pull out of this,

39:07.825 --> 39:09.860
I wouldn't hesitate
to send the troops in.

39:09.861 --> 39:13.610
But once we do that,
Khoosat is finished,

39:13.611 --> 39:14.940
along with our nuclear agreement.

39:14.941 --> 39:17.780
Hell, the whole country could
become a bigger mess than Syria.

39:17.781 --> 39:20.940
We've got to let this play
out a little longer. Let's...

39:20.941 --> 39:24.980
offer Khoosat military escort
to one of our air bases.

39:24.981 --> 39:26.980
Get him to safety,

39:26.981 --> 39:28.780
let him regroup.

39:28.781 --> 39:30.671
I'll reach out and make the offer.

39:32.151 --> 39:35.251
Thanks for coming in, everyone.

39:38.151 --> 39:39.961
(door opens)

39:41.861 --> 39:44.650
How's Murphy Station?

39:44.651 --> 39:47.900
They're evacuating with
the rest of the embassy.

39:47.901 --> 39:51.150
Just waiting to hear when they
arrive at Shindand Air Base.

39:51.151 --> 39:53.150
So...

39:53.151 --> 39:55.150
Good night, sir.

39:55.151 --> 39:57.251
Good night.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.980
(knocking)

40:00.981 --> 40:02.610
(gasps)

40:02.611 --> 40:03.861
- Oh.
- We're gathering.

40:03.862 --> 40:04.946
I didn't know if you wanted

40:04.947 --> 40:05.547
to come.

40:05.548 --> 40:06.981
No, yeah. Um, sorry.

40:07.281 --> 40:08.071
What's this?

40:08.072 --> 40:08.860
It was delivered

40:08.861 --> 40:10.860
while you were sleeping.

40:10.861 --> 40:13.110
That's, um,

40:13.111 --> 40:15.820
Arabian jasmine.

40:15.821 --> 40:17.440
At least, that's what I ordered.

40:17.441 --> 40:18.520
I really have

40:18.521 --> 40:20.520
no idea.

40:20.521 --> 40:21.690
Hey... Oh!

40:21.691 --> 40:24.520
That's... Okay.

40:24.521 --> 40:26.001
Very nice.

40:26.941 --> 40:28.121
(chuckles)

40:29.071 --> 40:32.291
Off to the meeting.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.320
(elevator dings)

40:35.321 --> 40:37.730
No, no. You go ahead.

40:37.731 --> 40:38.401
Ma'am.

40:38.402 --> 40:39.070
Blake.

40:39.071 --> 40:41.094
The prime minister is en
route to the air base now.

40:41.095 --> 40:42.980
However, the Chinook
carrying the employees

40:42.981 --> 40:45.280
from the Islamabad embassy
just arrived at Shindand,

40:45.281 --> 40:47.203
and Murphy Station is not on board.

40:47.204 --> 40:48.190
What?

40:48.191 --> 40:50.752
I've put out word to locate them
immediately, but given the chaos

40:50.776 --> 40:53.364
- of the evacuation...
- No, no, no, no. They have to find them.

40:53.365 --> 40:55.422
DAISY: Ma'am.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.860
Prime Minister Khoosat left
without our military escort.

40:59.861 --> 41:01.296
(indistinct shouting)

41:01.297 --> 41:02.831
(horn honking)

41:09.981 --> 41:11.881
(loud thumping)

41:15.063 --> 41:17.692
_

41:18.101 --> 41:19.454
_

41:20.170 --> 41:21.331
_

41:22.158 --> 41:23.166
_

41:23.396 --> 41:24.379
_

41:25.281 --> 41:26.501
(indistinct shouting)

41:29.380 --> 41:30.650
_

41:32.111 --> 41:34.211
(grunting)

41:38.560 --> 41:39.241
_

41:39.718 --> 41:40.939
_

41:43.521 --> 41:45.751
(shouting, grunting)

41:50.669 --> 41:53.230
DALTON: This is nothing less than
a hit on Prime Minister Khoosat

41:53.231 --> 41:55.400
called by his own foreign minister.

41:55.401 --> 41:58.610
He knew exactly what he was
doing by sending that tweet.

41:58.611 --> 42:00.110
And now it's done.

42:00.111 --> 42:01.520
PARKER: JSOC is ready

42:01.521 --> 42:03.110
to initiate render safe, Mr. President.

42:03.111 --> 42:05.940
SecDef recommends we do it immediately.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.730
It'll unleash total chaos.

42:08.731 --> 42:11.570
But it's hard to see
our way out of it now.

42:11.571 --> 42:14.150
I believe it's the right call,
Mr. President.

42:14.151 --> 42:16.820
I would agree, sir.

42:16.821 --> 42:19.320
What about Murphy Station?

42:19.321 --> 42:21.730
I'm assured they'll
be brought to safety.

42:21.731 --> 42:24.320
Once they're located.

42:24.321 --> 42:26.820
I'd like to wait until all of
our citizens are out of danger.

42:26.821 --> 42:29.940
ELIZABETH: I appreciate
that, Mr. President,

42:29.941 --> 42:34.440
but securing over 100 nuclear
warheads in a fallen regime

42:34.441 --> 42:38.881
with ties to multiple jihadist
groups has to take precedence.

42:40.941 --> 42:44.711
I agree. It's time to send in
the troops and render safe.

42:50.191 --> 42:52.291
Do it.

42:54.981 --> 42:56.940
(line ringing)

42:56.941 --> 42:58.690
Come on, Henry. Come on.

42:58.691 --> 43:00.480
Pick up.

43:00.481 --> 43:03.081
(beeping)
