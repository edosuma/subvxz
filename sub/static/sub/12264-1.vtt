00:02.121 --> 00:04.077
Well?

00:04.201 --> 00:09.559
Picture this. Gus comes down to
breakfast, and he doesn't say a word.

00:10.761 --> 00:16.996
He even kinda smiles, like he forgot he
hates me. And you know what he does?

00:17.361 --> 00:20.114
He serves me
an extra helping of pancakes.

00:21.081 --> 00:24.039
I asked him if I was still grounded. "No. "

00:24.721 --> 00:29.078
I asked him if you could stay over
tonight. And he nods.

00:30.041 --> 00:32.555
It's like we're a family.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.637
A real family.

00:45.801 --> 00:47.837
Chase, this is Elliot Rudman.

00:47.961 --> 00:51.033
I've looked over the blood specimen
you sent me on Zowie.

00:51.161 --> 00:53.117
Could you give me a call?

00:59.481 --> 01:02.075
- Are you open?
- Yeah, come on in.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.437
Do you have any kitties left?

01:08.161 --> 01:11.949
Yeah, you can take your pick.
They're back in the boarding area.

01:12.241 --> 01:16.280
- You can go on back, through there.
- OK. You ready? Let's go.

01:26.441 --> 01:28.830
- Hello?
- Rudman, it's Matthews.

01:30.881 --> 01:34.920
Matthews, was it your idea of a joke
to send me blood from a dead animal?

01:35.481 --> 01:37.437
I didn't get that.

01:38.161 --> 01:40.391
I said, next time it might be a good idea

01:40.521 --> 01:43.638
if you take a blood sample
while the animal is still alive.

01:43.761 --> 01:46.992
- Just give me the lymphocyte count.
- It's normal.

01:47.121 --> 01:51.478
There's nothing to indicate that the
animal died from an immune deficiency.

01:51.601 --> 01:55.879
Died? There's some kind of
mix-up here. This dog is alive.

01:56.201 --> 01:59.637
Not this dog. The cells
are completely deteriorated.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.710
- You took over for Yolander, right?
- Yeah, why?

02:02.841 --> 02:07.039
Cos the last person that sent me blood
from a dead animal was Yolander.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.198
This is not blood from
a dead animal, Rudman.

02:19.801 --> 02:21.871
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

02:22.001 --> 02:23.957
- What happened?
- Jesus.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.075
Oh, no.

03:02.321 --> 03:04.437
How's it goin', losers?

03:06.721 --> 03:08.313
Jeff. Drew.

03:12.081 --> 03:15.915
- Saved by the bell.
- Dad has to bail him out.

03:19.361 --> 03:21.921
Can I spend the night
at Drew's house tonight?

03:22.041 --> 03:24.077
Yeah, that's fine.

03:24.201 --> 03:27.830
Listen, guys, I got the tests back
on Zowie, and he's not well.

03:29.281 --> 03:31.590
Don't ask me how, but he's gotten out.

03:31.721 --> 03:36.272
So if he finds his way home, I want
you to call me. Whatever hour, OK?

03:37.481 --> 03:39.631
- Sure, Dad.
- Yeah.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.070
OK. See ya.

03:58.681 --> 04:03.801
You would be so much more
interesting with blue eyes.

04:21.041 --> 04:24.431
- State your business.
- Dr Yolander, I'm Chase Matthews.

04:24.561 --> 04:27.837
I just took over your offices in Ludlow.

04:28.321 --> 04:31.279
I sent out a blood sample for analysis

04:31.401 --> 04:34.871
and they told me that the blood
was from a dead animal.

04:35.001 --> 04:37.151
You might as well come in.

04:42.841 --> 04:46.834
Why are you bothering me with this?
Can't you just let it be?

04:52.241 --> 04:57.190
The pathologist, he said that you had
a similar incident with a cat.

04:59.401 --> 05:01.995
Creed cat, that's right.

05:03.401 --> 05:05.676
Bastard's name was...

05:05.801 --> 05:06.790
Church.

05:09.161 --> 05:10.879
Let me guess.

05:11.281 --> 05:15.638
Your dog's tissue isn't healing,
uh, pupils aren't dilating.

05:16.241 --> 05:18.118
Maybe you can't find a heartbeat.

05:18.241 --> 05:21.677
Exactly. I thought it was
some kind of blood condition.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.357
There's no blood condition.

05:27.481 --> 05:29.437
The dog isn't sick.

05:30.201 --> 05:32.396
It's dead.

05:32.521 --> 05:35.081
And so was Creed's cat.

05:35.761 --> 05:37.797
And so was his wife

05:37.921 --> 05:40.719
on the night she was killed
for the second time.

05:41.001 --> 05:43.435
Now, you want some advice, my friend?

05:43.561 --> 05:47.600
You get in your car and you
get the hell out of that town.

07:03.441 --> 07:06.399
Goddammit, Gus. This isn't funny.

08:20.961 --> 08:22.838
- Where's your boyfriend?
- I don't know.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.715
Don't lie to me. I'm gonna
give you one more chance.

08:26.841 --> 08:29.196
- I don't know.
- All right, that's it.

09:37.241 --> 09:39.675
I can come back, Chase.

10:56.041 --> 11:00.080
Do you think everybody that came back
would be like your stepdad?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.157
I don't know.

11:03.281 --> 11:05.636
Maybe it depends on
what you were like.

11:06.081 --> 11:08.151
Before you died.

11:21.841 --> 11:23.957
See you at school Monday?

11:24.761 --> 11:26.717
- Yeah, sure.
- Jeff?

11:27.881 --> 11:30.441
Do you ever think about running away?

11:31.281 --> 11:33.158
All the time.

11:33.281 --> 11:35.237
See ya, man.

12:24.281 --> 12:25.839
Shit.

12:35.801 --> 12:37.757
Well, well.

12:37.881 --> 12:39.837
Look who's here.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.436
Have fun, junior. Here we go.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.350
Guess your dad's not here
to save you now, is he?

13:17.481 --> 13:19.711
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Yeah?

13:20.561 --> 13:23.598
You ever see a tyre
take off a nose before?

13:24.001 --> 13:26.834
Neither have I. Might even kill ya.

13:27.521 --> 13:31.799
The wheel might chew right into
your brain. You could visit your mom.

13:42.081 --> 13:44.037
Jesus Christ, Gus.

13:44.721 --> 13:46.677
Go home.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.997
I said go home.

14:04.841 --> 14:07.116
I was just fuckin' with him.

14:07.321 --> 14:12.031
What are you gonna do, give me
a ticket? I mean, shit, Gus. Come on.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.996
You can't lay a finger on me.

14:30.241 --> 14:34.120
- What are you doin', man?
- I'm just fuckin' with ya.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.754
Stop it, man.

14:47.561 --> 14:49.517
Stop it.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.875
Whoops.

15:42.921 --> 15:47.756
This is the police.
Come out with your hands up.

15:54.961 --> 15:57.111
No, Zowie. It's me.

16:00.721 --> 16:02.677
Stay back.

16:13.561 --> 16:15.836
Forget somethin', Drew, buddy?

16:37.321 --> 16:39.551
Drew, buddy.

16:42.441 --> 16:46.354
You have the right to remain silent
while I smash your head in.

16:46.481 --> 16:51.680
You have the right to an attorney, but
you won't need one cos you'll be dead.

16:52.481 --> 16:55.553
No, Zowie, it's me.
No, Zowie. Get back.

17:01.081 --> 17:03.037
Oh, God.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.674
You understand these rights,
Drew, buddy?

17:13.241 --> 17:16.153
Or are you just too fucking stupid?

17:24.080 --> 17:25.638
Mom.

17:33.561 --> 17:37.634
Gus killed Clyde, Mom.
He's trying to kill me.

17:37.761 --> 17:40.514
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.

17:41.081 --> 17:42.753
Oh, shit.

17:42.921 --> 17:45.640
Drew, Daddy's not done.

17:47.281 --> 17:49.636
- Mom.
- What are you saying?

17:58.441 --> 18:02.195
- Gus is dead.
- What are you talking about?

18:11.241 --> 18:13.197
Oh, God.

18:14.001 --> 18:15.559
Oh, no.

18:40.881 --> 18:42.837
Mom, look.

18:43.401 --> 18:46.359
- God, what does he want?
- He wants to kill us.

18:56.121 --> 18:57.998
What do you want?

18:58.121 --> 19:00.077
Gus. Stop it.

19:10.641 --> 19:12.597
Drew, what is he doing?

19:18.321 --> 19:20.073
Bye, Drew, buddy.

19:22.761 --> 19:23.716
Shit.

20:18.201 --> 20:22.956
I'm takin' you up the hill, Clyde, buddy.
That's the way the Indians did it.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.160
In local news, tragedy
has struck the town of Ludlow.

20:37.281 --> 20:40.273
Neighbours paid their respects
to Drew and Amanda Gilbert,

20:40.401 --> 20:42.471
who died in a head-on collision
on Saturday.

20:42.601 --> 20:46.879
They are survived by Gus Gilbert,
who is Sheriff of Kennebago County.

20:47.001 --> 20:50.391
Those poor people.
Did you see Gus at the funeral?

20:51.601 --> 20:53.193
Yeah.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.157
I feel so bad for Jeff.

20:57.681 --> 20:59.637
How's he taking it?

21:01.401 --> 21:03.357
I haven't talked to him.

21:04.121 --> 21:06.157
He's been up in the attic all afternoon.

21:06.441 --> 21:09.558
The disappearance of
a Ludlow youth remains a mystery.

21:09.681 --> 21:12.400
Clyde Parker was last seen
on Saturday afternoon.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.240
His motorcycle
was found off Highway 62.

21:35.121 --> 21:36.600
What are you doin'?

21:36.721 --> 21:38.837
Getting things ready for Mom.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.471
Mom is dead, Jeff.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.557
You know that.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.476
She doesn't have to be.

21:59.481 --> 22:01.631
What are you talkin' about?

22:02.801 --> 22:07.238
I can bring her back, the same way
me and Drew brought Zowie back.

22:07.361 --> 22:10.114
What you're sayin' is crazy, Jeff.

22:10.241 --> 22:13.392
- Zowie didn't die.
- He did. We buried him.

22:13.921 --> 22:17.675
There's a place in the woods. If you
bury something there, it comes back.

22:17.801 --> 22:20.031
- Come on.
- We did it on Gus.

22:20.361 --> 22:23.831
- Don't you lie to me.
- Fine. Don't believe me.

22:23.961 --> 22:28.716
Chase, you have a phone call.
It's the caretaker at the cemetery.

22:42.481 --> 22:45.279
- I'll call back.
- He says it's an emergency.

22:45.401 --> 22:47.835
Something about your wife's grave.

22:53.401 --> 22:55.357
We're not finished.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.638
What?

23:05.761 --> 23:07.911
No, I'll be right there.

23:09.961 --> 23:12.156
- What happened?
- I don't know.

23:13.161 --> 23:16.233
Can you stay here with Jeff
while I take care of this?

23:19.121 --> 23:21.476
Don't let him leave this house.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.670
OK.

23:30.121 --> 23:32.157
I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr Matthews,

23:32.281 --> 23:34.841
but I thought you'd wanna
come and look for yourself.

23:34.961 --> 23:37.077
It's the damnedest thing.

23:38.121 --> 23:41.193
- Gus did this?
- Yes, he stuck around after the funeral,

23:41.321 --> 23:44.438
told me that he had an order
to exhume your wife.

23:44.561 --> 23:48.918
Now, I didn't think much about it until I
saw him drag the body out of the coffin.

23:49.321 --> 23:51.551
He put your wife in his pick-up,

23:51.681 --> 23:56.118
and then he drove off right through
Amanda and Drew's headstones.

23:56.241 --> 24:00.519
It's the weirdest thing that's happened
since Louis Creed dug up his boy.

26:02.241 --> 26:04.391
You bury your own.

26:36.881 --> 26:38.439
Jeff?

27:02.441 --> 27:04.397
Are you OK?

28:20.241 --> 28:22.197
I hate that dog.

28:37.921 --> 28:40.993
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

28:41.121 --> 28:45.353
or is no longer in service. If you feel
you have reached this number in error,

28:45.481 --> 28:50.032
please check the number and try again,
or ask your operator for assistance.

29:08.841 --> 29:10.957
What are you doing, Gus?

29:15.721 --> 29:18.076
Well, I was buildin' a doggy door.

29:18.761 --> 29:21.195
What's goin' on around here, Gus?

29:23.401 --> 29:25.392
Why did you dig up my wife?

29:27.641 --> 29:29.757
Cos I wanted to fuck her.

29:36.561 --> 29:38.517
I hate it when that happens.

29:44.201 --> 29:44.997
No.

29:45.121 --> 29:47.077
Got a permit for this?

29:51.281 --> 29:53.158
I didn't think so.

29:57.481 --> 29:59.437
Let me know if this hurts.

30:09.521 --> 30:12.672
No brain, no pain. Think about it.

30:32.481 --> 30:35.041
Remember, Chase, I had Renee first.

31:56.401 --> 31:58.153
Marjorie.

31:58.801 --> 32:00.757
Jeff?

32:06.401 --> 32:09.154
Did you really think
you could be like me?

32:40.961 --> 32:42.030
Mom.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.836
I came back for you, Jeff.

32:46.121 --> 32:48.476
We're going to be together again.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.876
We can try again, Chase.

33:47.001 --> 33:48.673
Oh, my God.

33:50.241 --> 33:52.516
We can make it work this time.

33:55.921 --> 33:57.479
No.

34:04.801 --> 34:07.269
Don't you love me any more, Chase?

34:07.401 --> 34:09.437
You're not Renee.

34:10.721 --> 34:12.677
Renee's dead.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.476
Get away from her, Jeff.

34:22.241 --> 34:24.197
Get away.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.918
Jeff, honey,
why don't you go downstairs?

34:31.440 --> 34:33.591
Your father and I need to talk.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.039
Jeff.

34:47.281 --> 34:49.237
I love you.

34:50.641 --> 34:52.597
I love you more.

35:01.321 --> 35:03.152
- Hey, junior.
- Shit.

35:03.281 --> 35:05.431
Wanna play?

35:17.161 --> 35:19.117
Looks like Daddy got a boo-boo.

35:23.201 --> 35:25.351
Now, where were we?

36:16.841 --> 36:20.595
Here it comes, buddy.
Here it fucking comes.

36:32.201 --> 36:35.432
You're gonna die, junior.

36:40.801 --> 36:42.712
Eat this, asshole.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.157
- Come on, Dad.
- Get out.

37:13.081 --> 37:15.037
I'm gonna get you outta here, Dad.

37:15.161 --> 37:16.913
Come here.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.597
I'm melting.

37:41.081 --> 37:44.517
Jeff, honey, what are you doing?

37:46.001 --> 37:46.956
No.

37:48.761 --> 37:50.797
You're not gonna leave me, Jeff.

37:54.041 --> 37:58.319
Your father and I are
trying to work things out.

38:01.281 --> 38:05.638
Jeff, I don't wanna be alone.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.955
Come back, Jeff.

38:14.321 --> 38:15.879
I love you.

38:16.681 --> 38:20.356
She's not your mom, Jeff. Let's go.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.717
Stay with me.

38:25.481 --> 38:27.119
Dead is better.

38:34.041 --> 38:36.635
Stay with me.

39:12.161 --> 39:14.117
You all set?

39:14.841 --> 39:16.797
Let's go.
