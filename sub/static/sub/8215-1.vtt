WEBVTT

00:36.370 --> 00:37.519
CARRIE:
All right, you're going

00:37.570 --> 00:40.391
to need to add more pumice
to the dryer to scuff these up.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.190
Are you listening to me?

00:41.240 --> 00:44.107
Otherwise,
they will not look real.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.677
Any 7-Eleven clerk will know
these are phony.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.405
Maybe I should test
the magnetic ink levels.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.543
Yeah, maybe you should
make yourself useful.

00:49.580 --> 00:50.569
They have...

00:51.780 --> 00:53.714
Caught this guy
trying to crash the party.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.411
What should
we do with him?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.168
You just picked
that card.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.269
Could you be more dumb?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.098
The blueberry's
over here.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.243
Ow!
Bad Carrie.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.248
Hey. I have a perfect memory.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.111
Why not use it
to help a little girl?

01:30.150 --> 01:31.617
Her brother is picking on her.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.756
Joan of Arc, Marie Curie,
Florence Nightingale...

01:34.790 --> 01:37.179
they were all tormented
younger sisters

01:37.230 --> 01:38.686
and they all turned out fine.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.322
Fine?
Mm-hmm.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.452
Burned at the stake,

01:41.500 --> 01:43.525
radium poisoning, influenza...

01:43.570 --> 01:44.525
Not so fine.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.629
What?
Well, I'm
just asking

01:47.670 --> 01:51.367
_ because sometimes
an Increased estrogen surge

01:51.410 --> 01:54.334
can create a heightened
maternal impulse.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.200
Okay. I'm not ovulating

01:56.250 --> 01:57.376
and I'm not... maternal.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.479
Okay.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.217
Bet Al wants kids.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.217
Okay, what are
you talking about?

02:03.250 --> 02:04.217
What, what?

02:04.250 --> 02:05.683
I'm just trying to figure out

02:05.720 --> 02:07.153
why you and Al are not together.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.782
Why are we having this
bizarre conversation?

02:08.820 --> 02:12.551
Yeah, okay...

02:12.600 --> 02:13.726
What are you...
what are you doing?

02:13.760 --> 02:15.398
That's my manure shovel.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.692
You know,
every time

02:16.730 --> 02:18.595
you and Al are
in the same room together,

02:18.630 --> 02:20.393
I need a cold shower.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.395
Oh.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.533
Speak of the devil.

02:23.570 --> 02:24.639
Hi, AI.

02:25.670 --> 02:26.898
Okay.
I'm on my way.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.305
Bye.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.171
Something's going on with Jay.

02:35.650 --> 02:36.912
Nice.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.952
I'm not ovulating.
WEBSTER:
Hmph.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.651
JAY:
Sorry for dragging you

02:42.690 --> 02:43.759
into this.

02:43.790 --> 02:44.882
My sister's ex-husband
is missing.

02:44.930 --> 02:45.726
Since when?

02:45.760 --> 02:46.658
Last night.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.952
Evan didn't show for
his custody visitation.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.592
YouTe
an uncle?

02:50.630 --> 02:52.495
They share custody of a dog.
A Pomeranian.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.496
I'm sorry. Come again?

02:54.540 --> 02:55.768
Look, I know it
sounds ridiculous,

02:55.800 --> 02:57.859
but Natalie's a CPA,
super levelheaded.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.537
I've never seen her
freak like this.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.638
I just want
her to know

03:00.680 --> 03:02.341
that we're all
there for her.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.405
I pinged, uh,
Evan's cell phone

03:04.450 --> 03:05.576
to the
Carlton Hotel.

03:05.610 --> 03:06.872
I'm sure it's nothing.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.649
I'll go find
Natalie.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.841
You brought me all
the way down here

03:10.890 --> 03:12.289
to use my overtaxed
superpowers

03:12.320 --> 03:13.753
because
of a dog?

03:13.790 --> 03:14.757
Man.
Whatever.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.781
You owe me.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.897
Aw...

03:21.930 --> 03:23.989
NATALIE:
Here's a recent picture of Evan.

03:24.030 --> 03:25.395
Thank you so much
for helping.

03:25.430 --> 03:26.863
I know this seems insane,

03:26.900 --> 03:28.390
but I'm positive there's
something wrong.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.305
He has
never missed

03:30.340 --> 03:31.659
a custody visitation.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.302
If it's important to you
and your brother,

03:33.340 --> 03:34.671
it's important to us.

03:34.710 --> 03:35.734
JAY:
Look, Nat,

03:35.780 --> 03:37.372
you divorced Evan
for a reason.

03:37.410 --> 03:39.514
I mean, the guy's
a pretty flalq guy.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.814
He's a musician, so, yes,

03:41.850 --> 03:44.512
but two things
he never screws up on:

03:44.550 --> 03:46.279
arriving on time for his gigs,

03:46.320 --> 03:47.617
and visiting Derek Jeter.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.957
Derek... Jeter?

03:48.990 --> 03:50.252
Jeter's the Pomeranian.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.427
Of course he is.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.898
Evan's in room 2424.

03:55.930 --> 03:56.965
Okay, let's go.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.966
The divorce was
really rough on Evan,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.308
so he's kind of undergone

04:03.340 --> 04:05.001
a personal makeover recently.
MAN: _
I have your bags here, Sir.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.337
Uh, sir?

04:06.380 --> 04:07.369
NATALIE:
He took a day job...

04:07.410 --> 04:08.832
MAN:
Room 14.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.847
...driving a truck.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.676
I think he's...

04:10.710 --> 04:13.508
working really hard
to win me back.

04:13.550 --> 04:14.710
Understandable.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.514
Getting his
act together.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.552
Can't play in
a band forever.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.982
This is gonna. get awkward

04:25.030 --> 04:26.554
when we barge in on Evan
with another woman.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.522
Or another Pomeranian.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.003
AL:
Jay, keep her
out of here.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.007
AL:
This is Lieutenant Burns.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.517
I need_CSU
on snte

04:47.550 --> 04:48.869
here at the
Carlton Hotel.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.548
We have a gunshot victim, DOA.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.581
No!

05:13.740 --> 05:16.004
Single gunshot wound
in the back.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.007
The body's still warm.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.019
CSU thinks this happened
in the last hour or so.

05:20.050 --> 05:21.779
And no wallet,
no keys.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.742
Are you sniffing?

05:23.790 --> 05:26.350
This lingerie
has not been worn,

05:26.390 --> 05:27.459
which is strange.

05:27.490 --> 05:28.582
Not as strange as you

05:28.620 --> 05:29.723
sniffing panties.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.580
What's it
doing here?

05:31.630 --> 05:33.495
All of this
feels staged.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.395
Hey.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.523
Evan registered for the room
this morning.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.868
Paid for it with
his credit card.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.993
Well, guy checks
into a hotel

05:42.040 --> 05:43.132
at that time
for one reason.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.001
Anyone see him
with a woman?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.133
No, but this is a busy hotel.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.772
It's a perfect place
for a nooner.

05:48.810 --> 05:51.643
So maybe a prostitute robs Evan,

05:51.680 --> 05:53.147
something goes sideways,

05:53.180 --> 05:55.068
she shoots him,
flees the scene.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.088
Simple robbery homicide.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.815
Or not so simple.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.011
NATALIE:
Evan and I were divorced,

06:02.060 --> 06:04.528
so he was free to do
whatever he wanted to,

06:04.560 --> 06:07.051
but him being here
makes no sense.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.489
I know this is hard,

06:09.530 --> 06:11.521
but can you think of
any other reason

06:11.570 --> 06:13.060
why he would be registered

06:13.100 --> 06:15.432
in this room this morning?

06:15.470 --> 06:17.028
I know what this looks like.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.107
But... Evan was a musician,

06:20.140 --> 06:21.437
he liked girls,

06:21.480 --> 06:22.799
girls liked
him back.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.148
He didn't need
to pay anyone.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.717
He barely had
any money.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.445
The truck driving
job only covered

06:31.490 --> 06:33.117
his rent
and food.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.616
Evan was wearing a, uh, lanyard

06:34.660 --> 06:36.150
with an ID in it in the photo

06:36.190 --> 06:38.078
that you showed me.
Yeah, he always wore it.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.722
Always?

06:39.760 --> 06:42.729
Yeah. I know this is_
gonna sound really weIrd,

06:42.770 --> 06:44.624
but... I gave him

06:44.670 --> 06:47.138
the lanyard to wear
around his neck

06:47.170 --> 06:48.728
so he wouldn't flake out

06:48.770 --> 06:50.863
and forget his work ID.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.878
And he told me
he'd wear it everywhere,

06:52.910 --> 06:55.731
just to prove to me
how responsible he was,

06:55.780 --> 06:58.578
so I would
take him back.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.717
Hey.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.911
Oh, hi. How's Jay doing?

07:04.950 --> 07:07.748
Okay, given
the circumstances.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.655
How, uh, how's
your leg holding up?

07:09.690 --> 07:11.487
So far so good.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.191
I never thought the
plow pose would injure me.

07:13.230 --> 07:16.825
I never thought of you
as a "namaste" kind of girl.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.695
Andre and I ended up
in the bedroom,

07:19.740 --> 07:21.935
and everyone knows the
plow pose enhances...

07:21.970 --> 07:23.460
All right, you know what?

07:24.540 --> 07:26.576
I don't need that... visual.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.678
Okay...

07:29.710 --> 07:31.678
All right.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.177
Now, the
ballistics guys

07:33.220 --> 07:34.676
are doing
more tests,

07:34.720 --> 07:37.518
but the bullet is,
to say the least, unusual.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.518
It's a caliber

07:39.560 --> 07:43.485
unique to an Indonesian
assault pistol.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.221
There was a take-out bag
with an Indonesian flag on it

07:52.270 --> 07:54.192
right outside of
Evan's hotel room.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.798
There's got to
be a connection.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.137
The... Indonesian flag?

07:57.170 --> 07:59.263
That memory

07:59.310 --> 08:00.971
_ Mrs. Furst's
third-grade classroom.

08:01.010 --> 08:02.102
Right above Emily Hubley's desk.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.539
Flags of the
world poster.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.706
Okay, okay, okay.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.705
Okay, okay.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.968
Half orange, half yellow,

08:08.020 --> 08:09.510
white dragon?

08:09.550 --> 08:10.209
Bhutan.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.013
Oh, why do
I even try?
Sorry.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.551
Okay.

08:13.590 --> 08:14.955
Here's the gun,

08:14.990 --> 08:16.628
a Pindad PS-01.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.218
That is
an armor-piercmg bullet.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.728
Mm-hmm.
I mean, even I
couldn't get my hands

08:20.760 --> 08:22.796
on one of those if I wanted to.
Well, ballistics guys say

08:22.830 --> 08:24.229
that there's not a gun store

08:24.270 --> 08:25.828
within a thousand miles

08:25.870 --> 08:27.997
that would carry
anything for this.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.736
Why does a prostitute
need heaw ammo?

08:30.770 --> 08:32.237
She wouldn't.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.709
Jay, no one would blame you
if you needed some time.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.218
Evan's hotel room was opened
at 6:45 this morning.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.158
Nobody else

08:49.190 --> 08:52.557
entered with a key
until you and Carrie.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.056
What about security cameras?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.897
Nothing on any
of the floors.

08:55.930 --> 08:58.319
Still waiting on the security
tapes from the lobby,

08:58.370 --> 09:00.634
but there's a
back entrance.
Mmm.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.809
Let me guess: no camera there?

09:02.840 --> 09:04.262
You got it.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.972
And nobody in the hotel
puts Evan with a woman.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.035
Carrie thinks there
mIght be a connection

09:09.080 --> 09:11.640
to a Indonesian
restaurant.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.647
Run_ Evan's
credit cards,

09:12.680 --> 09:13.817
see if you can
link him to one.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.249
Already in the works, boss.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.247
Got the subpoena.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.838
Burns.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.916
What's up?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.053
I'm kicking
the Evan Rusk investigation

09:24.090 --> 09:25.284
to the 17th squad.

09:25.330 --> 09:26.888
No, you're not.

09:26.930 --> 09:28.295
Jay's one of us, Eliot.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.127
Yes, and I'll make sure
the case is at the top

09:30.170 --> 09:31.228
of the 17th's priority list,

09:31.270 --> 09:33.932
but Evan ended up
in a hotel room
with a prostitute

09:33.970 --> 09:35.062
and was murdered.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.260
That's for
the homicide division...

09:36.300 --> 09:38.359
Okay, Eliot. U-Use
your imagination here.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.105
All right?
E-Evan's keys,

09:40.140 --> 09:42.608
his lanyard, his
trucking ID...

09:42.650 --> 09:43.878
all stolen.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.844
His truck might
be missing, and

09:45.880 --> 09:49.270
hijacking across state
lines is a major crime.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.743
The issue with
a truck hijacking

09:51.790 --> 09:53.917
is that you need
an actual hijacking.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.279
So where is this truck?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.379
W...
I have it,
Eliot.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.284
You are a long way
from Washington,

09:59.330 --> 10:00.297
Francis.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.628
Well, you know, sometimes
my work brings me

10:02.670 --> 10:05.025
to America's second
most Important City.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.332
ijgirgéi‘c‘
. 57:; 52:5:

10:07.370 --> 10:08.962
Special Agent Frank Simms,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.331
United States Secret Service.

10:10.370 --> 10:11.268
CARRIE: Oh.
Yeah.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.171
Lieutenant Al Burns,
Detective Carrie Wells.

10:15.210 --> 10:18.043
I'm sure they're also curious
as to what you're doing here.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.140
Oh, I'm taking over Evan
Rusk's murder investigation.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.169
Secret Service?
On what grounds?

10:22.220 --> 10:23.414
It's a local crime.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.839
Well, Rusk's murder is part
of an ongoing

10:25.890 --> 10:27.312
counterfeiting investigation.
Ha!

10:27.360 --> 10:28.816
You see?
Major crime.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.350
Thank you, Francis.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.221
Frank is fine;
you can call me Frank.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.329
Okay.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.691
No, you know,

10:34.730 --> 10:35.958
this isn't over.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.262
I'm gonna find out
who authorized

10:37.300 --> 10:38.426
this big-footing of my case.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.062
If you have any questions,
Eliot, you can call my boss.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.988
Oh, he's gonna play
the POTUS card.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.134
The president
of the United States of America.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.330
You want his cell number?

10:46.370 --> 10:48.235
I got it.
No.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.235
SIMMS:
Okay, well,

10:49.280 --> 10:51.202
Evan Rusk transported

10:51.250 --> 10:52.877
a pallet of currency-grade paper

10:52.920 --> 10:55.445
used exclusively to
produce the new $100 bill.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.846
There's not only one
but three "holy grails"

10:57.890 --> 10:59.380
of counterfeiting
the new hundred.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.387
The first one...

11:00.420 --> 11:01.887
Currency-grade paper

11:01.920 --> 11:02.955
with an embedded
holographic strip.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.026
The second is magnetic ink

11:05.060 --> 11:06.049
that registers

11:06.090 --> 11:07.819
on the Federal Reserve Bank
counting machine.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.418
And the third

11:09.460 --> 11:11.462
is valid serial numbers

11:11.500 --> 11:13.388
from the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.793
I read
your Homeland Security memo

11:14.840 --> 11:16.262
enﬁﬂed,

11:16.300 --> 11:17.836
"The New Hundred

11:17.870 --> 11:18.905
Anticounterfeiting Measures."

11:18.940 --> 11:21.374
Well, it's nice to know someone

11:21.410 --> 11:23.401
doesn't only read our
memos, but remembers them.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.769
I'm impressed.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.072
Don't be; it's genetic.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.372
She was born
with a frealq memory.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.819
Well, there's only one way

11:28.850 --> 11:30.909
into the cargo area of the truck

11:30.950 --> 11:32.315
without using explosives.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.056
The driver's swipe ID.

11:34.090 --> 11:35.455
Evan's missing lanyard.

11:35.490 --> 11:36.479
Show-off.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.828
Right again.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.122
And no one

11:39.160 --> 11:42.493
has ever stolen even one sheet

11:42.530 --> 11:44.760
of US. currency paper.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.926
Until today.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.961
Here's another truck hijacking.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.865
Same MD. as Evan's murder.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.229
Hotel killing.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.498
You know, based on these photos,

11:52.540 --> 11:56.203
and the fact that you're here
with your panties in a twist,

11:56.240 --> 11:57.446
I'd say the magnetic ink

11:57.480 --> 12:00.040
is also missing, am I right?

12:00.080 --> 12:01.877
Someone's acquiring
your holy grails.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.115
What about the valid
serial numbers?

12:04.150 --> 12:06.209
That, I'm afraid,
is on a need-to-know basis.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.786
Oh, he did not just...

12:07.820 --> 12:08.616
Oh, yes, he did.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.218
The Bureau of Engraving
and Printing

12:10.260 --> 12:14.128
has confirmed no breach
of serial numbers.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.355
I have now fulfilled

12:16.400 --> 12:18.197
the Homeland Security mandate

12:18.230 --> 12:19.527
for interdepartmental
cooperation.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.162
Well, I guess you don't want
to hear

12:21.200 --> 12:22.428
about our Indonesian connection?

12:25.810 --> 12:28.529
You found some link
to Indonesia?

12:28.580 --> 12:30.309
I mean, I could talk to you

12:30.350 --> 12:31.874
about the Indonesian link,
but you have to include

12:31.910 --> 12:33.775
Major Crimes
in your investigation.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.414
That way we can all accomplish
what we want here.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.816
Can I have my hundred first?

12:38.850 --> 12:40.078
You, my friend,

12:40.120 --> 12:41.815
are having a very
difficult time

12:41.860 --> 12:43.851
keeping track
of US. currency today.

12:46.530 --> 12:47.997
Uh...

12:48.030 --> 12:50.897
You'll never see
your money again.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.761
Yeah.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.104
I followed up on
Carrie's Indonesian lead.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.209
Gaamﬁ

13:00.240 --> 13:01.878
Actually, Jay found that Evan

13:01.910 --> 13:04.470
had a credit card charge
from two weeks ago at Medan,

13:04.510 --> 13:06.819
an Indonesian restaurant
on the Lower East Side.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.112
Nice job.
Mm-hmm.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.515
I'll let the special agent know.

13:09.550 --> 13:10.778
You know,

13:10.820 --> 13:13.209
Simms had quite the reputation
when I was back at the Bureau.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.955
Yeah, you knew him?
Of him.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.879
His scouting report said he was
the biggest player in DC.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.579
since
the Clinton administration.

13:19.630 --> 13:22.349
What's your point, Murray?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.958
I'm just saying,
where there's smoke...

13:24.000 --> 13:25.024
Good intel.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.196
Appreciate the heads up.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.033
I see you made
yourself comfortable.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.877
The crew I'm after...

13:34.910 --> 13:37.174
Crew we're after.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.178
Jenny Shaw, graphic designer,

13:39.210 --> 13:40.518
likely the papermaker.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.609
Kristen Green, the engraver.

13:42.650 --> 13:45.039
Olivia Waring,
the electroplater.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.182
And finally,

13:46.220 --> 13:47.517
Sophie Dietrich,

13:47.560 --> 13:49.209
the intaglio printer.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.579
All art school grads.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.928
All went off the grid
about four months ago.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.292
Really? This is your team
of counterfeiters?

13:55.330 --> 13:56.319
They don't look like killers.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.229
Well, your pretty partner
doesn't look like a cop.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.295
Hey, what's her deal,
by the way?

14:02.340 --> 14:03.864
Let's get back to the case.

14:03.910 --> 14:04.638
What is the connection

14:04.670 --> 14:06.331
between these hot girls?

14:06.370 --> 14:08.008
They met on the darknet.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.598
We think their hotness

14:09.640 --> 14:11.005
isn't a coincidence.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.449
We believe they're seducing
men like Evan

14:12.480 --> 14:14.516
in order to gain access
to the materials needed

14:14.550 --> 14:16.279
to manufacture
counterfeit bills.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.242
That's why, uh,
we've given the operation

14:18.290 --> 14:19.587
the code name "Mata Hari."

14:19.620 --> 14:22.009
Hmm. Hold on.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.551
Why would four women with no
previous criminal records

14:24.590 --> 14:26.626
all decide to start forging

14:26.660 --> 14:29.652
the most difficult US. currency
to counterfeit?

14:29.700 --> 14:32.498
That stolen pallet
of currency-grade paper

14:32.530 --> 14:34.589
is worth $72 million.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.108
Is that enough "why,"
Lieutenant?

14:37.140 --> 14:40.109
My guess is, one
of these girls was with Evan

14:40.140 --> 14:41.505
at that Indonesian restaurant.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.599
Think it's worth a look.

14:46.710 --> 14:49.247
Okay, how did you know
that security camera

14:49.280 --> 14:50.941
was hidden
behind a Balinese puppet?

14:50.990 --> 14:52.582
Well, it seemed like
the best angle,

14:52.620 --> 14:54.383
and that's where
I would've put it.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.923
You're something.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.996
_ You've known me
for SIX hours and 42 minutes,

15:00.030 --> 15:01.918
and you're just now
figuring that out?

15:03.030 --> 15:05.498
Okay, so I showed you
my Indonesian connection.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.930
Now it's your turn
to show me yours,

15:07.970 --> 15:09.597
and don't tell me
it's on a need-to-know basis,

15:09.640 --> 15:11.528
or I'll hit you
with my rice balls.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.572
All right.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.639
_ We believe
a major international player

15:17.680 --> 15:19.500
in the fraudulent
currency market

15:19.550 --> 15:21.211
is making his way
to the United States.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.547
An Indonesian trader.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.219
So there's a ticking clock
on this whole operation,

15:25.250 --> 15:27.389
and your Charlie's Angels
counterfeiting crew,

15:27.420 --> 15:29.058
they've only got
a little bit of time

15:29.090 --> 15:30.318
to get
those valid serial numbers.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.328
Which plays into my hand.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.497
And by "my hand,"

15:33.530 --> 15:35.589
you mean "our hands," right?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.589
Okay.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.269
JAY:
I've been scanning through the
restaurant's security footage

15:41.300 --> 15:42.699
for two hours; no sign of Evan.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.662
Yeah, you two took
your sweet time.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.666
I got you some balls.
Coconut rice.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.029
Give them to your
new partner, Simms.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.331
He could use a pair.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.642
You're just jealous
because he's friends

15:50.680 --> 15:52.648
with the president
of the United States.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.216
Hey.
You're wearing a new tie.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.616
Well, yes, I have a fresh one.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.982
Doesn't everyone?
Have some balls.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.113
JAY:
Hey, guys, it's Evan.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.752
SIMMS:
Well, we can't see her face.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.018
We can't ID her.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.085
JAY:
Poor guy's being worked.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.688
This is getting us nowhere.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.265
Might be getting you nowhere,
but I saw that tattoo

16:16.300 --> 16:18.006
in the hotel today.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.359
Jay, zoom in on it.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.699
You find this normal?

16:21.740 --> 16:23.640
No, I find it exceptional.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.119
JAY: Tattoo is
of an Indonesian

16:28.150 --> 16:29.572
radical group, The Red Door,

16:29.620 --> 16:31.110
responsible for a
series of bombings

16:31.150 --> 16:33.015
and assassinations
in their homeland.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.118
Real anti-Western types.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.411
Did you see the woman's face?

16:36.720 --> 16:39.257
No, I think, I think
the door closed before...

16:39.290 --> 16:40.257
NATALIE:
The divorce

16:40.300 --> 16:42.256
was really rough on Evan,

16:42.300 --> 16:45.428
so he's kind of undergone a
personal makeover recently.

16:45.470 --> 16:48.769
He took a day job
driving a truck.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.234
MAN:
I have your bags here, sir.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.738
Uh, sir?
Room 14.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.685
Yeah, I saw her face.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.609
JAY: Pulled these from Interpol,
suspected Red Door members.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.753
Okay.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.057
Jay, stop right there.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.227
Go back three.
Go back, go back, go back.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.728
There. I am willing
to bet anything

17:17.770 --> 17:20.364
that we are looking
at Evan's murderer.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.697
SIMMS:
That's Padma Jindal.

17:21.740 --> 17:22.832
Her file says that,

17:22.870 --> 17:24.462
uh, Padma's family was killed

17:24.510 --> 17:26.364
by pro-Western forces
when she was a child.

17:26.410 --> 17:27.775
Now she's the spear end

17:27.810 --> 17:29.801
of the Red Door. Report
doesn't say anything

17:29.840 --> 17:31.000
about counterfeiting.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.814
So what's an assassin from
the Red Door doing in New York?

17:33.850 --> 17:35.340
AL:
And what does she need
counterfeit money for?

17:36.820 --> 17:38.845
I got an idea.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.085
I'm taking it to the darknet.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.765
It's been four hours
and nothing.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.667
I could have 25 specialists
in Washington

17:59.710 --> 18:01.803
trolling the darknet
and trying to make contact

18:01.840 --> 18:02.875
with these people.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.470
But you didn't have
the Padma Jindal connection.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.115
Until now.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.549
We've made contact.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.514
I posed as a seller

18:11.550 --> 18:12.539
of valid serial numbers.

18:12.590 --> 18:13.557
Teased them I had a contact

18:13.590 --> 18:16.150
over at the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.487
The counterfeiters are pushing
a meet tomorrow morning.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.327
This totally tracks
with your intel

18:19.360 --> 18:20.497
about the Indonesian
money buyer.

18:20.530 --> 18:21.792
You think your 25 specialists

18:21.830 --> 18:23.525
could've scored a meeting
this quickly?

18:23.570 --> 18:25.265
Even a blind pig finds
a truffle.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.369
Who you calling a blind pig?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.435
You know what, I'm gonna

18:27.470 --> 18:29.791
get a cup of coffee.
Do you have an operations plan?

18:29.840 --> 18:32.138
Well, procedure is,
we send someone in

18:32.170 --> 18:33.171
to meet the counterfeiters

18:33.210 --> 18:34.905
and give them
a proof of concept--

18:34.940 --> 18:36.032
a valid serial number.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.275
When the number comes up clean,
we arrange for payment,

18:38.310 --> 18:40.813
a second meeting, and tail
whoever comes to the meeting.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.715
I don't think Padma
or the other operatives

18:42.750 --> 18:43.842
would risk exposure.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.881
They'll probably send
an intermediary.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.911
I can_have an undercover
operative up here from DC.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.929
in 24 hours.
You already have
an undercover operative: me.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.655
No, too risky.
I can't believe

18:52.690 --> 18:54.521
I'm saying this,
but Al's right.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.788
This is a Secret Service op.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.161
This is what we do.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.121
All right, you
guys get one shot

18:58.170 --> 18:59.922
with these girls, okay?
If you scare them,

18:59.970 --> 19:02.268
they disappear,
thatsit

19:02.300 --> 19:03.767
You don't get your
ink or your paper,

19:03.810 --> 19:05.232
and we don't help Jay
find Evan's killer.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.567
Carrie,
with all due respect,

19:06.610 --> 19:07.804
you're a local cop.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.603
I mean, you're a brilliant one,
for sure,

19:09.640 --> 19:11.904
but there's no way you have time
to learn enough

19:11.950 --> 19:13.747
about counterfeiting
to go undercover.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.144
Try me.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.586
The Liberty Bell
inside the inkwell

19:23.630 --> 19:25.586
doesn't change
from copper to green.

19:25.630 --> 19:26.654
Fake.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.954
Mm-hmm.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.763
Uh, there's some nice texture

19:30.800 --> 19:32.563
on Ben Franklin's shoulder;
this one's real.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.560
Okay.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.828
Okay, this is
just pathetic.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.599
The backside has the front

19:39.640 --> 19:41.631
of Independence Hall,
not the rear.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.204
Fake.
All right.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.899
This one's amateur stuff.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.906
What about this one?

19:49.950 --> 19:52.248
Watermarks are cold-pressed
after inking.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.212
Fake.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.887
Hmm.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.424
Did you take one of those online
memory courses?

19:59.460 --> 20:00.552
No.
Hmm.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.852
I'm a walking
online memory course.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.527
Honestly, I have HSAM.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.662
It's Highly Superior...

20:05.700 --> 20:07.497
Highly Superior
Autobiographical Memory.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.734
_ Yeah.
Wait a minute.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.704
Only five people
in the world have that.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.935
Six, and you really think
I'm that special?

20:12.970 --> 20:15.939
I think you think
you're that special.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.971
All right, try me.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.875
Give me a day, month, year.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.508
January 5, 1998.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.448
It was a Monday.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.811
Opening arguments
at the Unabomber trial,

20:29.860 --> 20:31.953
massive ice storm in Canada,

20:31.990 --> 20:34.493
and Brock Steele awloNardly
tried to pet my thigh

20:34.530 --> 20:35.792
throughout
the entire screening

20:35.830 --> 20:38.025
of The Titanic, 194 minutes

20:38.070 --> 20:39.867
at the Syracuse Megaplex.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.697
Okay, how-how do I know
you're not just making this up?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.059
Well, you can look it all up
on the Internet.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.763
Except for the Brock Steele
part, yeah, well.
Brock Steele thing?

20:46.810 --> 20:49.631
You got some mind on you.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.568
Yeah, sometimes it's a curse.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.272
Hmm.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.015
All right.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.280
Eight hours till the meet.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.548
I think I'm ready.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.979
I think you are.

21:02.020 --> 21:04.022
All right, see you.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.794
She just took my real hundreds.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.866
All right, well,
your guy said...

21:14.900 --> 21:17.539
Last time--_
my guy's name is Jay.

21:17.570 --> 21:18.969
Jay...
Thank you.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.978
...got the word from
the Mata Hari crew.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.899
Madison Plaza, 90 minutes.
We're gonna meet Carrie there.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.838
You can give them all
the cute code names you want.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.939
These women have killed
three people that we know of.

21:27.980 --> 21:28.912
And Padma's a wanted radical.

21:28.950 --> 21:31.418
You'r_e concerned
about solvmg a federal case.

21:31.450 --> 21:32.781
I'm concerned about
my partner's well-being.

21:32.820 --> 21:35.311
She's not in danger.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.920
The counterfeiting crew needs
thousands of serial numbers

21:37.960 --> 21:41.020
to cover what--
$72 million in bills?

21:41.060 --> 21:42.948
Carrie's gonna give them one.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.321
They're gonna need her alive
to get the rest.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.689
We're gonna monitor
her cell signal.

21:46.730 --> 21:47.958
Put a tracking device on her.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.490
No tracking device.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.939
Carrie's dead
if they find a GPS on her.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.768
Standard federal procedure.
Nonnegotiable.

21:53.810 --> 21:56.802
I don't care what your federal
handbook says, okay?

21:56.840 --> 21:58.705
We do undercover work
all the time.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.945
I'm telling you, these people
will try to sniff out a sting.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.675
This is Carrie's life
we're talking about.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.644
Well, that's exactly why Carrie
needs to do this by the book.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.658
My people are gonna handle
surveillance at the plaza.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.009
My people as well.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.687
No, your people are gonna
hang back at Major Crimes.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.085
No, we're all working together
on this one, Frankie.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.018
Oh, geez...
Unless you want to call my boss?

22:15.060 --> 22:17.051
MONY?

22:17.100 --> 22:18.089
"MONY"?

22:18.130 --> 22:19.392
Mayor of New York.

22:19.430 --> 22:21.068
Think of him as the POTUS

22:21.100 --> 22:23.807
of the five boroughs.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.932
Yeah.

22:27.070 --> 22:28.139
I know you're busy.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.546
No, no, it's not a problem.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.048
You're gonna get
whoever did this, right?

22:33.080 --> 22:36.117
Look, my team?

22:36.150 --> 22:38.118
These guys, they're the best.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.117
And now, Al and Carrie have

22:39.150 --> 22:42.449
got my back, which means
they got your back, too.

22:42.490 --> 22:43.684
I wish that made me feel better,

22:43.730 --> 22:47.518
but that doesn't
bring Evan back.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.551
No, it doesn't.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.795
But it might be
the starting point

22:51.830 --> 22:54.390
to help you get on
with your life.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.692
I just wish
I hadn't been so stubborn.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.708
I'm such a control freak.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.833
And I was always waiting
for the perfect time.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.131
Perfect time for what?

23:02.180 --> 23:05.570
To tell Evan
that I changed my mind.

23:05.610 --> 23:07.919
And that I wanted him
to come back.

23:07.950 --> 23:11.044
You know, Nat, Evan called
me a couple weeks ago.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.546
He told me

23:12.590 --> 23:15.980
that he was working really hard

23:16.020 --> 23:18.921
to become the man that you
always wanted him to be.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.053
The lanyard?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.089
You know what he said?

23:22.130 --> 23:23.495
He told me that, uh,

23:23.530 --> 23:24.895
that he had a lot of hope,

23:24.930 --> 23:26.568
and that hope made him happy.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.591
Sounds like Evan.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.435
Get who did this.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.674
Promise?

23:34.710 --> 23:36.871
Have I ever let you down?

23:38.610 --> 23:41.044
Thanks, Jay.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.139
Now, as a reminder...
"Reminder," really?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.080
I know, I know! I'll give them
one valid serial number,

23:45.120 --> 23:47.680
arrange payment,
and set up a second meeting.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.085
Then make your way back to us.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.587
Yeah.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.120
Got it.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.821
Take this burner.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.896
Anything seems off,
you call my cell.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.522
Carrie has the one and only

23:57.570 --> 23:59.458
emergency number
she needs-- mine.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.967
Oh.
Here you go.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.558
Oh.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.669
All right.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.530
You'll be back with us soon.

24:05.570 --> 24:09.176
Thank you.

24:09.210 --> 24:10.234
You'll do great.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.577
See you in a bit.

24:11.610 --> 24:13.043
Mm-hmm.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.071
BOTH:
Good luck.

24:29.230 --> 24:31.619
You guys on her?

24:31.670 --> 24:34.059
MAN: She's moving,
but her tracker's off-line.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.738
This is what you do?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.202
Come on, guys, move it.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.488
I got her phone.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.198
Get her in!

25:04.230 --> 25:06.221
Close it up.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.805
She has to be in the step van
they used to block the camera.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.603
But I'm gonna use every tool
in my arsenal to find her.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.629
You lost her.
I'll find her.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.307
Well, it'd be a hell of
a lot easier to find her

25:17.340 --> 25:18.807
if she was still
wearing a tracker.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.908
The only reason she's
alive right now is

25:19.950 --> 25:21.076
because they didn't
find it on her.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.041
Guys, we got something.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.911
These four step vans
all exited this location

25:23.950 --> 25:25.611
within three minutes
of Carrie's abduction.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.787
AL:
Broadcast an alert

25:26.820 --> 25:28.219
for all vans matching
that description.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.114
Have them stopped and searched
until we find Carrie.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.923
There's about a thousand
vans that look

25:31.960 --> 25:33.951
Get it over the air right now!
exactly like that
in Manhattan.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.991
God!

26:38.230 --> 26:39.879
Oh.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.763
Well, this isn't

26:45.800 --> 26:48.963
a very nice way to start
a partnership, ladies.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.865
It might affect my Yelp review.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.730
Is she clean?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.133
She's clean, no bugs.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.205
Didn't draw a tail
after we grabbed her.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.742
I hope you have a valid
serial number for me.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.782
If I don't call my associate,

27:03.820 --> 27:05.742
you won't get
your serial numbers.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.281
You know, I'm not sure I like
the way you conduct business.

27:08.320 --> 27:12.029
I'm not in_ the business
of trusting anyone.

27:12.060 --> 27:15.154
Particularly someone
I've never met.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.760
Serial number.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.234
Untie me, and I'll give you one.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.939
Does anybody have a pen?

27:36.780 --> 27:37.849
Thank you.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.851
Can I use your hand?

27:43.360 --> 27:44.987
I'll give them one valid
U.S. serial number,

27:45.030 --> 27:45.985
arrange the payment,

27:46.030 --> 27:49.022
and set up a
second meeting.

28:06.780 --> 28:08.418
You know, you really
should have more faith.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.339
I have faith you're gonna
give me all the numbers now.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.950
Give me my money and I'll
give you the serial numbers.

28:13.990 --> 28:16.083
How about give me
the numbers and you live?

28:16.120 --> 28:18.156
Your whole operation falls apart

28:18.190 --> 28:19.851
without me.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.323
How about you
wire the money,

28:21.360 --> 28:22.918
I give you the serial numbers?

28:22.960 --> 28:25.292
We get it at the same time,
and we both win.

28:27.300 --> 28:29.097
I'll wire it.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.903
But if my numbers don't show up
at the same time,

28:30.940 --> 28:32.999
I'll kill you.

28:33.040 --> 28:36.339
Here's the wiring information.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.311
I'm gonna need
to call my associate.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.147
Can I borrow a phone?

28:43.180 --> 28:44.511
Send the numbers
to this Web address.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.995
Hurry up.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.268
It's Carrie!

29:05.310 --> 29:07.266
Jay, try to get a trace.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.369
Keep her on the line
as long as you can.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.099
Hey.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.540
Roy, are Carl
and Darcy around,

29:15.580 --> 29:16.774
or can you talk?

29:16.820 --> 29:18.310
Uh, "Carl and Darcy."

29:18.350 --> 29:19.817
No, it's just me.

29:19.850 --> 29:20.851
What's up?

29:20.890 --> 29:22.050
I need you to send those, uh,

29:22.090 --> 29:23.387
items we talked about.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.557
Now? But I thought we needed...

29:24.590 --> 29:25.557
Just do it for me, Roy,

29:25.590 --> 29:26.784
within an hour, and you'll be

29:26.830 --> 29:28.388
on your way to Barbados,

29:28.430 --> 29:30.125
first class.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.320
It's gonna take some time.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.019
Come on, come on.
Carl and Darcy are gone,

29:33.070 --> 29:35.538
but my supervisor's
still on the floor.

29:35.570 --> 29:37.333
Uh, it could take an hour.

29:37.370 --> 29:39.406
Not a minute more,
Roy, okay?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.806
Send the numbers
to "emerald-five-

29:41.840 --> 29:43.876
four-five-dot-I-D."

29:47.880 --> 29:49.313
Damn it!

29:49.350 --> 29:50.578
VVhat
Didn't have Carrie
on long enough

29:50.620 --> 29:52.110
to triangulate the call.

29:52.150 --> 29:54.209
See, I would supply her
with the numbers, but...

29:54.260 --> 29:56.410
They'd kill Carrie
one second after they had them.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.349
Which means we have less
than an hour to save her life.

29:59.390 --> 30:00.891
"Carl and Darcy,"
what's that about?

30:00.930 --> 30:02.192
I don't know.
It's some kind of code;

30:02.230 --> 30:04.095
she's leaving a trail of
bread crumbs to find her.

30:04.130 --> 30:05.995
The problem is, I don't
have the memory she does.

30:07.370 --> 30:08.359
Carl's an old
partner of mine.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.095
Darcy's his wife.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.937
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

30:11.970 --> 30:12.937
Carrie met 'em once,

30:12.970 --> 30:15.109
when I dragged her
to a barbecue in Bayonne.

30:15.140 --> 30:17.028
Right across the Hudson.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.140
Bayonne's a
pretty big area, Al.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.114
Uh, what about, uh, Barbados--
does that mean anything?

30:22.150 --> 30:25.119
_She won a contest
in a bar in Syracuse,

30:25.150 --> 30:27.038
maybe ten years ago.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.387
Two tickets.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.997
Wait, we got snowed in.

30:34.030 --> 30:35.054
We actually flew out of Newark.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.092
Hold on...
flight path to Newark Airport

30:39.130 --> 30:40.028
cuts right over
the docks of Bayonne.

30:40.070 --> 30:40.889
Okay, let's roll.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.033
We have 57 minutes
to get to Jersey.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.934
28 minutes left.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.905
I hope your associate
comes through for you.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.077
He always does.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.045
Let me see the final proofs.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.546
Mmm...

30:59.590 --> 31:00.614
We have flawless proofs...

31:00.650 --> 31:03.312
and soon we'll have
their valid serial numbers.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.987
But I'm afraid
we're gonna have to

31:05.030 --> 31:06.383
renegotiate your cut.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.159
I thought the Red Door

31:08.200 --> 31:09.428
was the defender
of the oppressed,

31:09.460 --> 31:11.496
not the oppressor.

31:11.530 --> 31:13.259
Uh, the tattoo...

31:13.300 --> 31:14.665
on the back of your neck.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.998
I saw it in a
New York Times article,

31:17.040 --> 31:17.859
May 2010,

31:17.910 --> 31:19.935
"The Red Door
Closest to the West."

31:19.970 --> 31:22.029
You don't understand
the struggle of my people.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.048
You're right, I don't,

31:24.080 --> 31:25.570
but I do know
that killing her

31:25.610 --> 31:27.146
won't help your cause.

31:35.690 --> 31:36.657
She called me "Roy."

31:36.690 --> 31:37.452
What?

31:37.490 --> 31:39.026
On the phone,
she called me Roy.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.129
Why'd she call me Roy?

31:40.160 --> 31:41.627
Something about
the two of you.

31:41.660 --> 31:43.059
Any Roys you guys
have in common?

31:43.100 --> 31:44.169
It's got to be personal.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.293
Come on, channel Carrie.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.968
There's a fireman
named Roy.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.989
He lived in a
converted garage

31:49.040 --> 31:50.132
in my building

31:50.170 --> 31:51.262
when we first started...

31:51.310 --> 31:52.629
Dating?

31:52.670 --> 31:53.637
Figures as much.

31:53.670 --> 31:56.104
Wait... garage.

31:57.110 --> 31:58.179
Jay, Murray,

31:58.210 --> 32:00.576
we're looking for a
corrugated aluminum garage door,

32:00.610 --> 32:01.542
the kind that rolls up.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.639
It could be a_warehouse
or an old firehouse.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.292
We're running out of time.
Fan out!

32:14.330 --> 32:16.127
Look for a
corrugated garage door

32:16.160 --> 32:18.993
and then see if you can
spot the van.

32:20.630 --> 32:21.631
Bennie,

32:21.670 --> 32:23.262
get rid of these four.

32:23.300 --> 32:24.961
CARRIE:
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.238
I'm just saying...

32:26.270 --> 32:27.567
I wouldn't.

32:27.610 --> 32:29.407
See, y-y-you
got a problem here:

32:29.440 --> 32:32.204
this money is garbage.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.115
Y-You need them to fix this,

32:34.150 --> 32:35.276
this is never gonna fly.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.572
H can teach them.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.587
That way
you don't get pinched,

32:38.620 --> 32:39.780
it doesn't
trace back to me,

32:39.820 --> 32:41.583
and then you can kill them,
do whatever you want with them,

32:41.620 --> 32:43.713
but right now you need them.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.318
These bills have
to be aged,

32:45.360 --> 32:47.555
so where's the dryer?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.465
Do what she tells you!

32:56.100 --> 32:58.705
Let's get to work.

33:18.490 --> 33:20.378
Jay... there's an orange

33:20.430 --> 33:22.159
garage door.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.758
Roy was a crazy Syracuse fan;

33:23.800 --> 33:24.892
he painted his door orange.

33:24.930 --> 33:27.228
I don't know what you're
talking about, Al, who's Roy?

33:27.270 --> 33:28.168
Track my phone, Jay.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.236
Okay, keep the line open
and I'll find you.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.344
Wait for backup, Al.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.176
No time.

33:39.210 --> 33:40.199
No. Al, Al! Wait.

33:40.250 --> 33:43.014
Just keep tracking it.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.292
Hey, open up!

34:01.370 --> 34:03.634
All right, you're gonna
need to add more pumice

34:03.670 --> 34:07.208
to the dryer if you want
these to look real.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.070
You got to scuff
them up more.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.702
Right now any 7-Eleven
clerk would know

34:09.740 --> 34:10.729
that they are phony.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.348
Maybe I should test
the magnetic ink levels.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.244
Yeah, maybe you should
make yourself useful.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.269
They have...

34:17.480 --> 34:19.414
Caught this guy
trying to crash the party.

34:19.450 --> 34:20.417
What should
we do with him?

34:27.230 --> 34:28.424
Kill him.
CARRIE:
Wait.

34:28.460 --> 34:29.859
He's my associate.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.458
Roy.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.169
How'd he get here?

34:34.200 --> 34:36.168
You think she showed up
at the plaza alone?

34:36.200 --> 34:38.600
You were supposed to be
more careful.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.271
You're no better than the people
who murdered your family.

34:44.310 --> 34:47.199
What do you know
about my family?

34:47.250 --> 34:48.842
Everything I do
is to honor them.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.383
Murdering innocent people
doesn't honor anybody.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.388
Innocent?

34:53.420 --> 34:54.751
Look around!

34:56.160 --> 34:57.582
Roy...

34:57.620 --> 34:58.780
the numbers.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.127
Roy doesn't have them.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.252
I do.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.619
Then he's of
no more use to me!

35:02.660 --> 35:04.264
Wait!

35:07.370 --> 35:09.895
K356450000

35:09.940 --> 35:13.307
through K356454999.

35:13.340 --> 35:15.900
I just gave you 5,000

35:15.940 --> 35:17.703
valid serial numbers.
Check them.

35:22.850 --> 35:25.341
Good.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.813
Do you have the
rest of the numbers

35:27.850 --> 35:28.885
in that head of yours?

35:28.920 --> 35:33.289
Lower your weapons
and I'll give you 3,000 more.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.267
Come on.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.173
All right, we got to
hit them hard when we go in.

35:48.210 --> 35:50.929
All eyes on Carrie and Al.

35:50.980 --> 35:53.505
The signal's coming from
another block up.

35:53.550 --> 35:56.815
069999, that is 20,000.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.818
Just 5,000 more.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.281
Someone's breached the garage.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.412
Clean this all up,

36:02.460 --> 36:03.609
then torch the place.

36:13.470 --> 36:14.562
Federal agents!
Let me see your hands.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.693
Where's Padma Jindal?

36:16.740 --> 36:19.208
No sign
of Padma Jindal.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.366
Where is the intaglio press?

36:20.410 --> 36:21.399
JENNY:
We just made the plates

36:21.440 --> 36:23.476
and the proofs here;
she's printing somewhere else.

36:23.510 --> 36:25.398
All right,
she's probably printing

36:25.450 --> 36:26.303
where she's meeting her buyer.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.578
We got to move, people,

36:27.610 --> 36:29.646
or $72 million
goes flying out the window.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.942
And Evan's killer.

36:39.390 --> 36:40.880
There's a card
missing from this board.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.227
I-It was right on here.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.227
It had a number:

36:43.260 --> 36:46.229
"N2227SV."

36:46.270 --> 36:47.419
That's _not a
currency serial number.

36:47.470 --> 36:48.892
No.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.498
That's a tail number.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.531
Come on.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.693
Remarkable work, Padma.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.359
Our friends in Jakarta
will be very pleased.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.265
Were you careful
to enter the country

37:24.310 --> 37:25.959
without tipping
the authorities?

37:26.010 --> 37:27.898
I was extremely careful.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.498
Our people can use these weapons
against our true enemy.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.747
The president
of this arrogant country.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.407
However you want to use them.

37:33.450 --> 37:35.873
I'll take the money now.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.672
You don't care much
about the cause.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.416
My entire cause
is on the pallet.

37:42.860 --> 37:46.728
Then our struggle deserves
the guns and the money.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.824
FBI!

37:50.860 --> 37:52.418
Drop your weapon!

38:03.540 --> 38:05.804
Cover me on three.
I'll go.
No, I'll go.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.477
Three.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.448
Hold your fire.
Let me see your hands,
let me see your hands.

38:19.490 --> 38:20.582
Drop your weapon.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.791
Get down on the floor.
All right,
hold it right there.

38:22.830 --> 38:23.990
Get down!

38:25.630 --> 38:27.598
New York gets her first.

38:27.630 --> 38:30.463
Plenty of charges
to go around.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.368
She's all yours, Jay.

38:36.810 --> 38:41.873
You're under arrest
for the murder of Evan Rusk.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.911
What do we do with
all this cash?

38:51.990 --> 38:54.026
Ah, it's so beautiful.

38:54.060 --> 38:56.028
A shame it has to burn.

38:56.060 --> 38:59.427
Acts as a deterrent
to the bad guys.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.867
You are an unbelievable
pain in the ass, by the way.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.061
You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.
Uh-uh.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.566
No, I won't.
Yes, you will.

39:07.610 --> 39:08.508
No.
Yeah.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.405
Because you just might
be in Washington.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.977
Are you trying to recruit me,
Special Agent

39:13.010 --> 39:15.444
I don't need_to recruit
people to have dinner With me.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.641
See if you can remember
this number.
Oh, well.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.138
You seem awfully confident
that I'm gonna call you.

39:21.190 --> 39:23.613
I'm just overly confident
that you owe me money.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.582
You'll get your money back.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.086
You trust me, don't you?

39:28.530 --> 39:29.827
Not one bit.

39:29.860 --> 39:31.350
Hello. Simms.

39:34.770 --> 39:38.638
I don't know if I made
this clear, but he annoys me.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.604
You made it crystal clear.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.572
That guy...

39:41.610 --> 39:43.601
Really?
Come on.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.777
What?
Word on
the DC streets--

39:44.810 --> 39:46.175
total player.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.075
When I first met you,
you had the same reputation,

39:48.110 --> 39:49.509
so it seems like I have a type.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.984
Hmm.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.409
I need you to throw
the money on the pile there.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.484
What money?

39:55.520 --> 39:56.919
The stack you swiped
at the hangar?

39:56.960 --> 39:58.484
Don't have a stack.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.020
Throw it in,
or I'll arrest you.

40:00.060 --> 40:01.618
With handcuffs?

40:04.570 --> 40:06.561
You will not arrest me.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.999
Try me.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.531
Want to go to Mexico?

40:17.810 --> 40:19.448
CARRIE:
Wow.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.971
Mexico.
MeXIco.
