WEBVTT

02:18.971 --> 02:20.707
You made it!

02:21.742 --> 02:23.844
- <i>We</i> made it.
- Are you with anybody?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.244
Why are you wearing that?

02:25.278 --> 02:26.480
Uh, look around.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.248
You didn't graduate.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.451
They don't know that.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.388
I noticed they got here
<i>after</i> the ceremony.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.858
All right, so I may have
told them the wrong time

02:37.891 --> 02:40.293
and avoided telling them
I changed courses midyear.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.995
- Ali!
- I'll tell them, I swear.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.898
At an awkward dinner
five years from now.

02:44.932 --> 02:48.869
I mean, look, look at
those poor adorable fools.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.839
Do you really want me to
ruin their hopes and dreams

02:51.872 --> 02:54.341
with the news that continue
to be a fuckup today?

02:54.374 --> 02:56.710
You're a terrible,
terrible person.

02:57.109 --> 02:58.912
Guilty as charged.

02:58.946 --> 02:59.746
Oh, my God.

03:00.980 --> 03:01.748
Hi.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.920
Thought I'd stop
by, say congrats.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.957
Checking up on me.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.391
I'm sorry I didn't
bring anything,

03:11.425 --> 03:13.894
there really isn't a
registry for graduations.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.464
So, how are you?

03:17.498 --> 03:18.966
Keeping busy.

03:18.998 --> 03:19.833
You?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.001
Good, yeah.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.304
Almost a psychologist now.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.272
That is great.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.040
It's just great.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.847
Well, I've gotta get back.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.482
Just wanted to wish you well.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.819
Thanks for um, coming, Jane.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.087
It was really good to see you.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.958
You too, kid.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.597
You made a friend?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.604
Who the hell was that?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.540
And did she just check me out?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.775
It's just an old friend.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.844
Uh, you're not getting
away with that, that easily.

04:03.877 --> 04:08.080
No, Ali, wait, Ali...

04:18.725 --> 04:19.959
Hey!

04:19.993 --> 04:22.128
Cool ride, can I be
you when I grow up?

04:24.932 --> 04:28.100
Sorry, um, it's just
Lily's never mentioned you

04:28.134 --> 04:31.505
or any of her family or
friends, or anyone really.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.072
So this is kind of a huge deal.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.713
Uh, how long have you known her?

04:39.746 --> 04:41.247
Are you guys related?

04:41.280 --> 04:42.783
We're not related.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.484
And if Lily doesn't wanna
talk about something,

04:44.518 --> 04:45.752
isn't that her business?

04:48.388 --> 04:51.658
Look, Lily's private, I get
that's part of the deal.

04:51.692 --> 04:56.463
But she's not really
been herself lately

04:56.496 --> 04:58.432
- and I was...
- And who is that, exactly?

05:02.069 --> 05:04.805
Look, if anything
happens to her,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.442
or if she seems
stranger than normal,

05:09.743 --> 05:11.011
call this number first.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.284
Okay, but why would
anything happen to her?

05:51.118 --> 05:53.620
<i>Lily, I am so, so sorry.</i>

05:53.654 --> 05:55.856
It's fine, don't
worry about it.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.256
<i>No, you don't understand.</i>

05:57.289 --> 06:00.060
I rushed out of work,
got home to change,

06:00.093 --> 06:01.628
wore that special
shirt you bought me.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.631
<i>You know the one with
those crazy flowers on it.</i>

06:04.665 --> 06:06.933
Oh, you mean the one
that I got you as a joke?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.835
<i>Hey, I love that shirt.</i>

06:08.869 --> 06:12.572
I jumped in the car, switched
on the GPS lady and took off.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.240
I was actually running early.

06:14.273 --> 06:17.110
Now, you know how good
I am with directions.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.345
Not at all.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.147
<i>Exactly, which is
why I used the lady,</i>

06:20.179 --> 06:22.949
but this time she's taken me
out in the middle of nowhere.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.620
<i>Every 10 seconds she's
telling me to do a u-turn.</i>

06:26.653 --> 06:28.822
<i>Turns out I plugged in the
wrong MacArthur Street.</i>

06:28.855 --> 06:30.357
<i>Melbourne has three of them.</i>

06:30.390 --> 06:33.026
So I searched for
the other address

06:33.060 --> 06:34.528
<i>and speed your way.</i>

06:34.561 --> 06:39.298
Finally, I am traveling the
right direction when boom!

06:39.332 --> 06:40.701
The traffic stops.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.203
<i>For 20 minutes we inch
along, when finally I see it.</i>

06:45.372 --> 06:46.673
What?

06:46.707 --> 06:47.607
<i>A kitten.</i>

06:48.642 --> 06:50.209
A kitten.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.878
Little shit wouldn't
get off the road.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.880
<i>Someone would chase it
off and it would run</i>

06:53.914 --> 06:55.015
<i>straight back on.</i>

06:55.048 --> 06:56.917
It had a death wish, I guess.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.785
Can cats have death wishes?

06:58.819 --> 07:01.988
So you're telling me
that a kitten stopped you

07:02.022 --> 07:04.223
from coming to my graduation.

07:04.256 --> 07:07.728
<i>Well, a kitten and
my own stupidity.</i>

07:07.761 --> 07:11.331
I'm so sorry, Lil, I
really wanted to be there.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.599
It's fine, I'm here with Ali.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.000
We'll walk home together.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.002
Why don't I made you dinner?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.537
You can't even turn
on your oven without

07:17.571 --> 07:19.339
giving yourself
third degree burns.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.975
Skin grafts are temporary, love.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.443
<i>This is forever.</i>

07:23.477 --> 07:25.912
No, I'm pretty sure skin
grafts are permanent, idiot.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.784
Oh, fuck.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.954
That girl's gotta
have rocks for brains

07:33.987 --> 07:35.455
to fall for that nonsense.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.761
Don't talk like that about her.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.595
Why?

07:42.729 --> 07:44.331
'Cause you wuv her?

07:46.399 --> 07:47.534
Sorry!

07:49.436 --> 07:51.171
I forgot what a
noble hero you are.

07:52.072 --> 07:56.275
But I'm a damsel
under much...

07:58.044 --> 07:59.346
...distress.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.348
Will you stop?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.549
She'll be coming over later,

08:02.582 --> 08:04.651
I have to make dinner
and do housework.

08:04.684 --> 08:05.519
Or...

08:15.428 --> 08:17.564
Do me, instead.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.841
So I'm guessing golden boy
had another elaborate excuse?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.246
So the family are treating
me to a dinner tonight.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.414
Wanna join us?

08:34.447 --> 08:35.582
Laugh at my jokes?

08:35.615 --> 08:37.683
Stop me from actually
murdering them?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.986
Oh, and there is a grad
after-party tonight

08:40.020 --> 08:43.155
which I'm sure is going
to be highly inappropriate

08:43.190 --> 08:44.524
and far too messy.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.659
Wanna meet me there?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.528
Course not.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.630
Who am I asking?

08:50.664 --> 08:51.898
Call me later.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.718
You can jump in any
time you like, you know.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.257
The anticipation of
pleasure is much better

09:50.290 --> 09:51.658
than pleasure itself.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.761
Where did you get that from?

09:54.794 --> 09:56.963
I think it was a film
except it was "death"

09:56.997 --> 09:59.466
and "worse" and not
"pleasure" and...

10:00.700 --> 10:01.668
Fuck was that?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.404
Shit, what time is it?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.444
Okay, time to go.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.584
This isn't a game,
Vi, she'll be...

10:17.617 --> 10:19.819
She'll be sad for a few
hours, do some shots

10:19.853 --> 10:21.288
and get over it.

10:21.322 --> 10:22.622
Violet.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.090
Joshua.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.659
Please?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.733
You know, one of
these days I might

10:33.767 --> 10:35.135
get really fucking offended.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.203
I'll call you tomorrow.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.980
Fuck, Violet.

11:38.399 --> 11:39.232
Vi.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.102
Is that you?

11:51.511 --> 11:53.113
I swear I'll wring her neck.

12:09.829 --> 12:13.700
This is not fucking funny, Vi.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.975
Before anyone says a word,
please keep all conversation

16:16.009 --> 16:19.245
to a modest volume,
please and thank you.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.079
Hey.

16:20.113 --> 16:20.947
Lil!

16:21.814 --> 16:23.082
I just broke my own rule.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.452
Missed you last night.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.323
As usual, things happened,
then they escalated.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.325
It got apocalyptic
pretty quickly.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.661
What did you do?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.929
I, ah, just
had a quiet one.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.633
Really?

16:39.667 --> 16:40.800
I thought you'd be
having a nice night

16:40.833 --> 16:42.068
in with the boy toy.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.036
As far as I'm concerned,

16:43.069 --> 16:45.872
the boy toy no longer exists.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.375
Oh, Lil, sorry.

16:48.409 --> 16:49.208
Do we have cake?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.076
Come join us.

16:52.646 --> 16:54.348
Hello Lily, you there?

16:55.549 --> 16:57.785
I'd love to, but I can't.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.524
I've had to head off
for a day or two.

17:03.557 --> 17:06.393
Did you just go on an
adventure without me?

17:06.426 --> 17:09.530
Sorry hon, but this is one
I have to do on my own.

17:09.563 --> 17:10.763
You know what
happens a hero leaves

17:10.798 --> 17:11.897
her sidekick behind, right?

17:11.931 --> 17:12.766
It's never good.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.301
I'll be fine.

17:15.336 --> 17:17.338
I'll be back before you
can say lickety split.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.838
Lickety split.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.575
Well, fast, but not
that fast, smartass.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.811
Well, call me when
you get to wherever

17:24.844 --> 17:27.280
it is that you're going, okay?

17:27.314 --> 17:28.146
Love you.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.018
Love you.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.193
Is she okay?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.762
Hope so.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.325
Shit.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.959
How are ya, love?

19:51.991 --> 19:54.060
- What can we get you?
- Oh!

19:54.093 --> 19:56.563
- Um...
- Oh, never mind that lot.

19:56.597 --> 19:58.532
Don't get many
like you out here.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.535
You know, a pretty
girl away from the city

20:01.568 --> 20:03.637
rolling up stag all
the way out here

20:03.670 --> 20:05.606
in the middle of nowhere?

20:05.639 --> 20:08.775
Let me guess, car
ran outta juice.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.546
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.080
Right, you're not the first one.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.883
See old Murray there?

20:15.916 --> 20:19.720
His car ran out of petrol 30
years ago and he never left!

20:24.892 --> 20:27.628
Um, where is the
nearest petrol station?

20:27.661 --> 20:29.061
Oh, about 40k up the road?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.099
Yeah, it's been a bit of
a shit since they closed

20:33.132 --> 20:34.334
that one back at Bowser.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.103
Can you imagine that?

20:37.136 --> 20:40.374
A town called Bowser doesn't
even have a bloody servo.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.916
My name's Marlee.

20:48.949 --> 20:51.552
That boofhead there,
he's my other half, Tom.

20:51.585 --> 20:52.519
I'm sorry.

20:52.553 --> 20:53.720
No, no, that's all right.

20:53.754 --> 20:54.888
I've got a jerrycan
out the back.

20:54.922 --> 20:55.956
How far up the road are you?

20:55.989 --> 20:57.991
Oh, just a short walk.

20:58.025 --> 20:59.927
Oh, don't you worry
about a thing.

21:02.863 --> 21:05.465
What's your name, sweetheart?

21:06.533 --> 21:08.368
Um, Lily.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.107
Well, Lily, we take
good care of our guests

21:15.141 --> 21:16.577
up here, don't we, Marl?

21:16.610 --> 21:18.210
We do indeed.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.780
But there's something
that we would like

21:19.813 --> 21:21.782
you to do for us first.

21:29.823 --> 21:30.891
This is amazing.

21:30.924 --> 21:32.124
Thank you so much.

21:32.158 --> 21:35.963
Oh, best parma in
200 kilometers.

21:35.996 --> 21:38.164
Only bloody parma
in 200 kilometers.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.067
Oh shush your face.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.535
It's on the house for you, love.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.036
Are you seri, no.

21:43.070 --> 21:44.538
It's fine, I couldn't.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.739
Look, I'm just
really happy to see

21:45.772 --> 21:47.206
another sheila in this place.

21:48.942 --> 21:52.546
Thank you, this is...

21:52.579 --> 21:53.714
You guys are life savers.

21:55.849 --> 21:58.051
So Lil, what are you
looking for in this

21:58.085 --> 21:59.185
part of the world, then?

21:59.218 --> 22:01.421
Um, I'm looking for a house.

22:01.455 --> 22:02.356
Out here?

22:03.590 --> 22:06.360
Yeah, it's, uh, just
at the end of the road

22:06.393 --> 22:07.694
on the top of the rise.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.669
The house on the hill?

22:17.269 --> 22:18.905
Is something wrong?

22:21.041 --> 22:24.678
Yeah, uh, you don't
wanna go up there, love.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.849
Look, why don't we put
you up here for the night?

22:28.882 --> 22:30.651
No, I wouldn't
wanna put you out.

22:30.684 --> 22:31.785
Oh, it's no trouble.

22:35.989 --> 22:38.290
You're not one of them
ghost hunters, are you?

22:39.459 --> 22:40.961
Ghost hunters?

22:40.994 --> 22:43.563
Yeah, yeah, well you know,
a lot of folk around here

22:43.597 --> 22:45.297
are convinced that
place is haunted.

22:45.332 --> 22:47.199
Why would they think that?

22:48.835 --> 22:51.471
Because anybody
that goes up there,

22:53.340 --> 22:54.975
they don't come back.

22:55.008 --> 22:56.208
Squatters,

22:56.242 --> 22:57.644
kids looking for a thrill.

22:57.678 --> 22:58.645
All gone.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.548
You can't be serious.

23:04.651 --> 23:07.219
Yeah, look, uh, a young
family died up there

23:07.253 --> 23:08.689
about 20 years ago.

23:09.990 --> 23:13.160
Ever since, there's
been a darkness

23:13.192 --> 23:14.528
surrounding that place.

23:16.163 --> 23:19.231
We're simple, ordinary,
normal folk here.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.568
All right, we might
be a little kooky

23:21.601 --> 23:25.237
and set in our ways,
but we're not religious,

23:25.271 --> 23:27.941
we're not superstitious and
we're definitely not mad.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.011
So believe us when we say to you

23:32.145 --> 23:34.815
nothing that has
gone into that house

23:34.848 --> 23:36.583
has ever come out alive again.

23:38.819 --> 23:39.753
God, that family.

23:40.754 --> 23:41.922
Lovely folks.

23:43.457 --> 23:45.592
I believe the mother
was pregnant at the...

23:46.960 --> 23:48.628
What was she like?

23:48.662 --> 23:49.496
The mother.

23:52.032 --> 23:53.500
Why do you wanna know that?

23:54.701 --> 23:56.737
Ah, there was one
person that came out

23:56.770 --> 23:58.105
of that house alive.

24:02.943 --> 24:03.777
You're...

24:08.381 --> 24:09.616
Oh, love.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.884
Yeah, that all right, Marl.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.019
Come on, let's get you
back on the road, hey?

24:14.421 --> 24:15.789
Thanks.

24:33.272 --> 24:36.710
There we are, all
right, give it a bell.

24:38.178 --> 24:39.880
Ah, there she is
back from the dead.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.382
Thank you so much,
I really really

24:42.415 --> 24:44.017
- appreciate it.
- Nah, no probs.

24:47.087 --> 24:48.088
Listen, Lil.

24:49.456 --> 24:52.592
In case you do change your
mind, there's a freeway turnoff

24:52.626 --> 24:54.293
about 30k's out of town.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.263
Take you straight back
to Melbourne, okay?

24:58.532 --> 25:00.367
Hope to see you again.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.418
Hi, you've called Alice.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.653
You know the drill.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.288
The beep.

27:01.322 --> 27:03.189
Hey, Al, you there?

27:04.591 --> 27:05.425
It's Lil.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.696
I'm not sure what's
happening, uh...

27:13.166 --> 27:14.402
You know, I think you're right,

27:14.434 --> 27:16.404
I shouldn't have tried
to do this on my own.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.875
I'm scared, Al.

27:24.678 --> 27:28.248
I thought everything would
be all right, but uh...

27:32.986 --> 27:36.489
You know, I'm sorry,
I'm just being crazy.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.025
I'm here out in the
middle of nowhere

27:39.059 --> 27:40.593
freaking myself out.

27:44.931 --> 27:45.865
Everything's fine.

27:47.801 --> 27:48.868
I'm fine.

27:48.902 --> 27:50.737
I'll call you tomorrow.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.410
If I survive the night
in my haunted house.

29:32.306 --> 29:33.807
Hello?

31:17.143 --> 31:17.944
What?

31:17.977 --> 31:18.878
Oh, hi.

31:20.013 --> 31:21.448
Alice.

31:21.482 --> 31:23.216
I'm Lily's friend.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.318
- We met-
- It's late.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.287
Yeah, sorry about that.

31:27.321 --> 31:29.155
- But Lily-
- I told you to call.

31:30.023 --> 31:30.857
I know.

31:33.327 --> 31:34.861
You don't really go in
for normal conversation

31:34.894 --> 31:35.762
or rhythms, do you?

31:35.795 --> 31:37.598
Or late night visitors.

31:43.036 --> 31:44.605
Lily left town really
early this morning

31:44.638 --> 31:46.574
and then tonight she left
me a really weird message

31:46.607 --> 31:48.309
and I haven't heard
from her since.

31:51.811 --> 31:53.713
- You told me to c-
- Define weird.

31:55.148 --> 31:56.216
She sounded scared.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.754
Did she say where she was going?

32:01.788 --> 32:05.124
She said something
about a haunted house.

32:12.232 --> 32:14.401
I'm sure she'll be fine.

32:14.435 --> 32:15.969
Yeah, but you didn't
hear the message.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.203
Yeah, but this
isn't the first time

32:17.237 --> 32:19.038
she's left without
warning, right?

32:19.072 --> 32:20.873
- Well no, but-
- And she's more than capable

32:20.907 --> 32:22.242
of taking care of herself.

32:22.275 --> 32:23.711
- Yes, but-
- It's probably

32:23.743 --> 32:26.513
a solo adventure, road
trip to clear the head.

32:26.547 --> 32:28.815
She'll be back for lattes
before you know it.

32:29.882 --> 32:31.585
So you're not gonna do anything.

32:32.919 --> 32:34.555
Aw, if it'll make
you feel better

32:34.588 --> 32:36.856
I'll run some checks,
find out where's she's at

32:36.889 --> 32:37.991
and I'll let you know.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.760
She likes skinny caps, actually.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.364
Great detail.

32:43.397 --> 32:44.897
- Thanks, Columbo.
- Sorry.

32:44.931 --> 32:47.300
Do you mind if I just use
your bathroom real quick?

32:50.537 --> 32:52.138
Thank you.

37:03.423 --> 37:04.223
Hello?

38:48.260 --> 38:49.096
You wouldn't.

38:50.229 --> 38:51.665
I've done more for less.

38:53.367 --> 38:55.102
You've got five
seconds to tell me

38:55.134 --> 38:57.104
why I shouldn't
shoot you right now.

38:59.238 --> 39:00.741
Or call the police.

39:00.774 --> 39:01.608
I'm sorry.

39:02.709 --> 39:05.312
This is extreme
behavior, even for me.

39:05.345 --> 39:08.147
I didn't mean any harm,
I'm just really worried

39:08.180 --> 39:09.716
about my friend.

39:09.750 --> 39:12.619
And by the looks
of it, so are you?

39:15.287 --> 39:16.523
If you're not gonna help me,

39:16.556 --> 39:18.125
I'm just gonna have
to find her myself.

39:39.446 --> 39:40.947
Buy me a coffee.

40:27.527 --> 40:30.296
The first thing you
need to know about Lily

40:30.330 --> 40:32.432
is people vanish around her.

40:34.334 --> 40:36.803
I've known her
longer than anyone,

40:36.837 --> 40:38.805
and loss is her
life's one constant.

40:40.140 --> 40:42.042
I've spent years
searching for answers.

40:43.577 --> 40:44.444
I'm still looking.

40:45.779 --> 40:48.048
I'm sure Lily told
you that she lost

40:48.081 --> 40:50.751
her parents at an early age.

40:50.784 --> 40:51.718
Which is the truth.

40:53.220 --> 40:56.022
But she's less chatty about
her years as a foster child.

40:58.558 --> 41:01.962
At age eight, Lily ended
up with the Frasers.

41:01.995 --> 41:05.264
How those fuckers got vetted
by anyone is a mystery.

41:06.666 --> 41:09.836
Leonard Fraser was an
alcoholic household despot

41:11.438 --> 41:13.940
who ruled his family
with an iron fist.

41:15.075 --> 41:17.811
One his kids too
often saw up close.

41:30.289 --> 41:32.492
Till the night he disappeared.

41:34.094 --> 41:36.730
He was missing for
six days before anyone

41:36.763 --> 41:38.198
bothered to investigate.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.300
Lily was living in filth.

41:43.637 --> 41:46.139
His wife was comatose,
never to emerge.

41:48.508 --> 41:49.943
What happened?

41:49.976 --> 41:52.512
Oh, at first they thought
he'd finally ran off

41:52.546 --> 41:55.816
with some poor wretch he'd
met at the local, but no dice.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.988
To eradicate your existence
takes skill and smarts.

42:03.824 --> 42:06.760
Qualities Leonard Fraser
was not famous for.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.532
After that, she got
lucky for awhile.

42:13.934 --> 42:16.870
She was taken in by an older
couple lovely as can be.

42:16.903 --> 42:18.171
They died just recently.

42:19.272 --> 42:21.241
Natural causes, I checked.

42:22.576 --> 42:25.512
Under them, Lily
got back on track.

42:25.545 --> 42:27.447
She studied hard,
got her marks up

42:28.782 --> 42:31.017
in everything but mathematics.

42:32.586 --> 42:34.988
You see, her year
eight maths teacher,

42:35.021 --> 42:37.891
Mr. Edgar Cooke, was a real gem.

42:37.924 --> 42:39.860
You know, the type of teacher

42:39.893 --> 42:42.929
who marks down the
prettiest girls' exams

42:42.963 --> 42:45.165
so they have to
see him after class

42:45.198 --> 42:46.967
for some private tutoring.

42:49.135 --> 42:52.505
Like Fraser, Cooke vanished
before he could get

42:52.539 --> 42:53.740
to our girl Lily.

42:56.009 --> 42:57.177
Coincidence?

42:59.313 --> 43:01.648
I'm not big on coincidences.

43:06.019 --> 43:07.888
And then there was
the slumber party.

43:09.323 --> 43:12.192
It was the end of school, an
attempt to make some friends.

43:14.362 --> 43:16.162
Didn't exactly go to plan.

43:30.577 --> 43:33.513
You've never tasted
marshmallows before, Lily?

43:33.546 --> 43:35.181
Uh, nope.

43:35.215 --> 43:37.918
Okay, this is how you do it.

43:37.951 --> 43:39.552
First you take your marshmallow,

43:41.488 --> 43:43.056
then your weapon of choice.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.095
Stab it quickly through the head

43:49.129 --> 43:51.531
before it even knows
what's happening.

43:54.734 --> 43:59.606
Victim number two, stab
it right under the jaw.

44:05.145 --> 44:09.082
Victim three, you can
play with this one.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.252
Make it really hurt.

44:13.753 --> 44:16.022
Does this have to be so macabre?

44:20.193 --> 44:21.027
Last one.

44:22.495 --> 44:24.264
That's just a mercy killing.

44:24.297 --> 44:26.166
Can't leave any witnesses.

44:26.199 --> 44:27.834
Should we be worried?

44:30.603 --> 44:32.406
I don't know, Lily, should we?

44:34.207 --> 44:35.141
What do you mean?

44:36.576 --> 44:38.144
You're an orphan, aren't you?

44:41.581 --> 44:42.782
Yeah but um...

44:42.816 --> 44:45.585
So what really happened
to your parents?

44:45.618 --> 44:47.721
Sonja, maybe you should stop.

44:47.754 --> 44:49.622
Did they die some
gruesome death?

44:49.656 --> 44:51.459
Is that why you
don't talk about it?

44:53.126 --> 44:55.295
I, uh, I was really
little at the time,

44:55.329 --> 44:56.596
I don't really remember.

44:56.629 --> 45:00.468
My mother said you were
the only one there.

45:02.470 --> 45:04.372
Tell us a scary story, Lily.

45:05.373 --> 45:07.273
How did you kill your parents?

45:07.308 --> 45:08.108
You really think

45:08.141 --> 45:09.743
I killed my parents?

45:09.776 --> 45:11.345
Why don't you shut the fuck up

45:11.379 --> 45:13.279
or who knows what
might happen to you.

45:35.635 --> 45:37.804
I knew she was a fucking psycho.

45:51.051 --> 45:52.052
She never told me.

45:53.421 --> 45:56.323
Lily's never spoken to
anybody about what happened.

46:04.731 --> 46:07.334
The only thing we know for sure

46:09.002 --> 46:12.138
is those girls were never
seen or heard from again.

46:23.083 --> 46:24.184
We think we know Lily.

46:25.085 --> 46:28.054
She's quiet, determined, lost.

46:28.088 --> 46:30.690
We feel the need to protect
her, save her from harm.

46:32.426 --> 46:34.160
But all those
traumatic experiences,

46:34.194 --> 46:35.695
they must have had an effect.

46:38.598 --> 46:40.568
What if, that night,

46:43.903 --> 46:45.473
she just snapped?

50:28.294 --> 50:29.496
You're nuts.

50:29.530 --> 50:31.799
I have to look at
it from every angle.

50:31.831 --> 50:34.300
Work the evidence, and
where there is none

50:34.335 --> 50:37.638
all I've got is motive,
opportunity and circumstance.

50:37.671 --> 50:39.272
And when I put those
into the slot machine,

50:39.306 --> 50:40.741
all three come up Lily.

50:42.409 --> 50:45.512
Lily might be weird, but
she's also the kindest,

50:45.546 --> 50:48.114
sweetest person I've ever met.

50:48.147 --> 50:51.250
There's no way she could
hurt anyone, let alone...

50:51.284 --> 50:53.853
Let alone stab four girls
to death while they sleep.

50:55.322 --> 50:58.525
You would be shocked how
normal a killer can seem.

50:58.559 --> 51:00.361
You know Karl Denke?

51:00.394 --> 51:03.764
The butcher who sold his
customers human flesh?

51:03.797 --> 51:07.334
He was a regular churchgoer
and a pillar of his community.

51:08.502 --> 51:11.372
He even played the organ
for special services.

51:13.039 --> 51:14.240
I don't buy it, sorry.

51:15.709 --> 51:18.379
How could she of even
disposed of the bodies?

51:18.412 --> 51:19.847
They were in an
abandoned house out

51:19.879 --> 51:21.682
in the middle of nowhere.

51:21.715 --> 51:23.617
The surrounding woods
would've been a perfect place

51:23.650 --> 51:27.321
to dispose of something
you didn't want found.

51:28.622 --> 51:30.289
You're delusional.

51:31.658 --> 51:33.427
You must have had a
wonderful childhood

51:33.460 --> 51:35.228
to think so well of humanity.

51:37.096 --> 51:40.667
Lily saw her parents slain
when she was barely three.

51:41.869 --> 51:44.671
Something like that,
it leaves a residue.

51:46.673 --> 51:47.775
Isn't that all the more reason

51:47.808 --> 51:49.610
why we should be protecting her?

51:49.643 --> 51:52.346
It's my job to protect everyone.

51:56.483 --> 51:57.584
That boyfriend of hers.

51:58.619 --> 51:59.453
What's his story?

52:00.987 --> 52:01.988
Ex-boyfriend.

52:02.021 --> 52:02.856
Interesting.

52:03.990 --> 52:05.893
He went missing three days ago.

53:42.456 --> 53:44.625
So the idea is to arrest Lily?

53:46.025 --> 53:48.328
The idea is to find her
and hopefully find out

53:48.362 --> 53:49.396
what's going on.

53:49.429 --> 53:50.764
Well I'm coming with you.

53:52.298 --> 53:53.132
No, you're not.

53:54.568 --> 53:56.068
Too many lives have
been lost already,

53:56.102 --> 53:58.472
do you really think
Lily will forgive me

53:58.505 --> 53:59.806
if I put yours in danger?

54:01.475 --> 54:03.944
Look, I'm sorry, I will
do everything I can

54:03.977 --> 54:07.046
to try to protect her,
but this is just something

54:07.079 --> 54:08.247
I have to do alone.

54:10.651 --> 54:11.985
You sound just like Lily.

54:12.920 --> 54:13.954
Okay, you know what?

54:13.987 --> 54:15.923
Fuck it, you were right.

54:15.956 --> 54:18.157
That whole sleepover thing
has got me freaked out.

54:18.190 --> 54:20.159
You just let me know as
soon as you find her, yeah?

54:20.192 --> 54:21.595
Yeah, of course.

54:21.628 --> 54:22.729
Having someone call
your best friend

54:22.763 --> 54:24.297
- a murderer is hectic.
- I didn't call

54:24.331 --> 54:25.799
her a murderer.

54:25.832 --> 54:28.035
Well no, but you have to
entertain the possibility.

54:28.067 --> 54:28.902
I get it.

54:31.137 --> 54:31.972
Okay.

54:34.341 --> 54:36.075
So when are you heading off?

54:36.108 --> 54:37.243
I'm just curious.

54:39.413 --> 54:41.782
I'll be leaving in the morning.

54:41.815 --> 54:43.383
Great, good luck.

56:57.283 --> 57:00.153
I'm calling the police, go away!

57:04.324 --> 57:05.525
Stop!

57:11.098 --> 57:11.932
Enough!

59:55.262 --> 59:57.264
Okay, so I may have
gone a little too far.

59:57.297 --> 59:58.098
You think?

01:00:06.406 --> 01:00:09.109
You are just driving,
you are not helping,

01:00:09.142 --> 01:00:11.444
influencing or getting
involved in this case

01:00:11.478 --> 01:00:13.613
in any way, do you understand?

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.519
Please tell me you understand.

01:00:27.727 --> 01:00:29.062
Sorry, just...

01:00:31.231 --> 01:00:32.065
Sorry.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:42.776
Sorry.

01:02:10.364 --> 01:02:13.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:16.970
I look after the
house, I'm not gonna...

01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:19.906
Lily?

01:02:21.409 --> 01:02:22.510
Is it really you?

01:02:26.713 --> 01:02:29.849
The lawyer didn't
tell you about me?

01:02:29.883 --> 01:02:32.453
The lawyer didn't tell
me much about anything.

01:02:33.753 --> 01:02:34.621
Do you live here?

01:02:36.022 --> 01:02:36.823
No.

01:02:38.291 --> 01:02:41.328
I wasn't considered
part of the family.

01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:44.164
Did you know my parents?

01:02:46.633 --> 01:02:48.134
It was a very long time ago.

01:02:57.777 --> 01:03:01.748
I do remember your
mother though, a little.

01:03:04.184 --> 01:03:06.686
She was a very beautiful woman.

01:03:09.055 --> 01:03:10.256
Not unlike yourself.

01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:16.564
What was she like?

01:03:16.596 --> 01:03:20.834
I think maybe I should
show you something.

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:46.560
This place looks like it's
been shut for 100 years.

01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:48.094
She might not be
in her glory days,

01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:50.196
but there's life in
the old girl yet.

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.499
And we're here because?

01:03:52.832 --> 01:03:54.968
I wanna make sure I'm
on the right track.

01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:06.179
Senior Constable,
you know I don't put

01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:07.548
my face on before 12.

01:04:08.648 --> 01:04:11.151
It's good to see you, Marlee.

01:04:11.184 --> 01:04:12.719
It's good to see you too, Jane.

01:04:12.752 --> 01:04:13.587
Come here.

01:04:16.723 --> 01:04:17.558
Come on in.

01:04:19.593 --> 01:04:21.529
Little Marlee over there,

01:04:21.562 --> 01:04:23.930
she had dreams of a
rock and roll lifestyle.

01:04:25.131 --> 01:04:28.801
And she lived it for
one glorious summer.

01:04:28.835 --> 01:04:30.670
Rode the bus to the
big smoke and vowed

01:04:30.703 --> 01:04:32.573
never to come back.

01:04:32.606 --> 01:04:34.408
Until one day her mom got sick

01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:37.043
and her dad couldn't run
this place without her.

01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:41.047
And she's been back behind
that bar ever since.

01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:43.716
Doesn't matter how far you run,

01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:47.321
the past will always
catch up with you.

01:04:50.857 --> 01:04:52.660
- Oh, Tom.
- There we are.

01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:53.893
You legend.

01:04:55.795 --> 01:04:58.698
Ah, you put Melbourne
baristas to shame.

01:04:58.731 --> 01:05:01.368
Ever thought of taking
your skills on the road?

01:05:01.402 --> 01:05:03.404
What, leave all of of this?

01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:07.807
Yeah, he knows
which side his bread's

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.577
buttered on, don't
you, sweetness?

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.144
- Thanks, darling.
- Ah, draft on tap

01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:12.580
- wins every time.
- It does.

01:05:19.085 --> 01:05:20.987
So we saw an
apparition yesterday.

01:05:23.122 --> 01:05:24.190
Back from the dead?

01:05:25.559 --> 01:05:27.695
Yep, wind's begun to howl again.

01:05:28.861 --> 01:05:30.063
Since when?

01:05:30.096 --> 01:05:32.366
Aw, three
or four nights ago.

01:05:32.399 --> 01:05:34.702
Before or after
the ghost sighting?

01:05:35.802 --> 01:05:38.137
It started the
moment she arrived.

01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:40.006
Yeah.

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:41.274
You know there's...

01:05:42.942 --> 01:05:45.011
There's gotta be
something darker out there

01:05:45.044 --> 01:05:47.514
than just some lost
little lamb, you know.

01:05:51.884 --> 01:05:54.421
Perhaps the lamb's
become the wolf.

01:05:55.723 --> 01:05:57.790
We both know that's not
what you believe, Jane.

01:05:58.825 --> 01:06:00.226
Yeah.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.495
Anyway, so why are you here?

01:06:01.528 --> 01:06:03.397
That's why you've
always been here.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:04.632
And we're kinda glad you are,

01:06:04.665 --> 01:06:06.500
because I reckon one
way or the other,

01:06:07.668 --> 01:06:08.736
she's gonna need you.

01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:27.287
This is who you are.

01:06:43.236 --> 01:06:45.539
How does a three-year-old
recover from that?

01:06:47.006 --> 01:06:49.543
We all thought she was so
young she'd forget it all.

01:06:52.613 --> 01:06:54.013
I did my best, but...

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:00.421
Witnessing all that
so young must fuck

01:07:00.454 --> 01:07:01.954
up your circuitry somehow.

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:06.327
Maybe it scrambled her for good.

01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:09.697
You can't really
believe that, can you?

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:13.634
I'm just hoping
it's not too late.

01:07:35.221 --> 01:07:38.659
I've always
been here for you, Lily.

01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:13.059
What...

01:08:13.092 --> 01:08:14.994
What did you do to her?

01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:18.163
She tried to hide you from me.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.604
But you were mine to protect,
mine to raise, mine to love.

01:08:38.352 --> 01:08:39.952
Lily, come on, it's time to go.

01:08:39.986 --> 01:08:41.287
Grab my hand, sweetheart.

01:08:41.321 --> 01:08:43.890
Come on, we have to
go, Lily, grab my hand.

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:44.818
You're a monster.

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:47.421
She tried to hide you from me.

01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:48.856
I couldn't let you
be raised by someone

01:09:48.889 --> 01:09:50.791
so willingly vindictive.

01:09:50.823 --> 01:09:52.926
I've been protecting
you ever since.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.463
All these people you
killed because of me.

01:09:56.497 --> 01:10:00.467
For you, for you!

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:01.735
This is...

01:10:01.768 --> 01:10:03.202
This is insane.

01:10:03.236 --> 01:10:04.905
They were worth nothing.

01:10:04.938 --> 01:10:06.773
Only you matter to me.

01:10:10.711 --> 01:10:15.549
I've never missed a concert,
a game, a play, a graduation.

01:10:19.085 --> 01:10:21.688
I've always been there for you.

01:10:23.824 --> 01:10:26.627
I have always watched over you.

01:10:30.797 --> 01:10:32.031
What is that?

01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:40.307
It's your graduation present.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.642
Open the door.

01:11:10.537 --> 01:11:12.639
Lily.

01:11:12.673 --> 01:11:14.007
Why are you...

01:11:17.143 --> 01:11:19.813
So Joshy boy here has been
running around on you.

01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:23.050
That night you finished
your last exam,

01:11:23.082 --> 01:11:26.587
you remember, he suddenly
had a 24-hour stomach bug?

01:11:27.988 --> 01:11:30.891
Turns out he was fucking
some girl he met at the pub.

01:11:30.924 --> 01:11:34.728
He got lost so often
you bought him a GPS.

01:11:36.697 --> 01:11:37.497
He was lost

01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:39.399
in other girls' vaginas.

01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:43.070
Every time he left a
gig you weren't at,

01:11:43.102 --> 01:11:46.940
every time he was late,
every time he missed a date

01:11:46.974 --> 01:11:49.309
he was sleeping
with another woman.

01:11:57.317 --> 01:11:58.284
Don't worry.

01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:05.157
I looked after her for you.

01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:17.169
For 20 years I've
looked out for you.

01:12:19.205 --> 01:12:20.474
But now it's time
for you to show me

01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:22.876
that you can look
after yourself.

01:12:24.444 --> 01:12:25.445
Starting now.

01:12:36.456 --> 01:12:37.624
You can do it.

01:12:44.031 --> 01:12:45.766
I'm right behind you.

01:12:57.243 --> 01:12:58.045
Dad?

01:13:01.014 --> 01:13:01.782
Yes, honey?

01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:07.754
I think I can do this on my own.

01:13:17.597 --> 01:13:18.432
I'm ready.

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:37.384
I'm sorry.

01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:47.828
Oh, God!

01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:49.029
Oh, God, Lily!

01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:51.031
I'm so sorry.

01:13:52.399 --> 01:13:57.404
I'm not a bad person,
I'm just weak and stupid

01:13:58.638 --> 01:14:01.341
and a terrible man and I
promise you that I'll...

01:14:01.374 --> 01:14:02.175
Ah!

01:14:05.679 --> 01:14:07.080
I saved you because
I'm not a psycho,

01:14:07.114 --> 01:14:08.548
not because I'm a fucking idiot.

01:14:08.582 --> 01:14:09.683
Now let's go.

01:14:17.124 --> 01:14:17.958
- Lily, wait, wait!
- Come on.

01:14:17.991 --> 01:14:19.593
- What?
- We can't just

01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:21.328
leave him there alive.

01:14:21.361 --> 01:14:23.196
He'll come after us,
you should've killed him

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:24.731
when you had the chance.

01:14:27.434 --> 01:14:32.439
Fine, okay, go, I'll take
care of it and just don't stop

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.475
until you find the
nearest police station.

01:14:52.225 --> 01:14:54.060
Over there.

01:14:57.330 --> 01:14:58.398
Fuck!

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.605
That was Josh, right?

01:15:07.073 --> 01:15:07.908
Yeah.

01:15:14.214 --> 01:15:15.215
Stay here.

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:17.751
Please.

01:15:52.085 --> 01:15:52.919
Lily?

01:15:55.021 --> 01:15:56.556
Lily, he's all right.

01:15:57.691 --> 01:15:59.059
Lily!

01:15:59.092 --> 01:15:59.926
Are you okay?

01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:04.130
Lily!

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.940
Lily?

01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:21.601
You want more? Keep it up!

01:18:50.563 --> 01:18:51.399
Shit.

01:18:51.432 --> 01:18:52.832
Hey, hey.

01:18:52.866 --> 01:18:53.700
Wake up.

01:18:54.901 --> 01:18:56.636
Hey, wake up.

01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:57.737
No, wake up.

01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:00.374
No, wake up, wake up, wake.

01:19:00.408 --> 01:19:03.710
Hey, hey.

01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:06.713
Okay, it's okay.

01:19:06.746 --> 01:19:09.350
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

01:19:09.383 --> 01:19:10.451
Are you?

01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:11.985
Just give me this.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.488
It'll be okay.

01:19:22.195 --> 01:19:23.029
It's okay.

01:19:28.469 --> 01:19:30.670
Okay, okay, you
have to stay here.

01:19:30.703 --> 01:19:32.373
Okay, you gotta stay
here and I'll be back

01:19:32.406 --> 01:19:33.873
in a second, okay?

01:19:33.907 --> 01:19:35.975
I'm gonna be right back.

01:19:48.489 --> 01:19:50.190
Let her go, let her go,
let her go, let her go!

01:19:50.223 --> 01:19:51.057
Hey, hey!

01:19:54.661 --> 01:19:55.862
She won't hurt me.

01:19:55.895 --> 01:19:59.400
No, she would never,
never, never hurt me.

01:20:00.867 --> 01:20:04.204
I keep trying to get rid of
her, she keeps coming back.

01:20:04.237 --> 01:20:07.408
She's here risking her
life because she loves me.

01:20:09.609 --> 01:20:13.012
So you don't have to
hurt anyone anymore.

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:15.281
Okay?

01:20:16.216 --> 01:20:17.418
We can start over.

01:20:17.451 --> 01:20:20.620
No, no, please, Dad.

01:20:20.653 --> 01:20:22.956
Please, Dad, no, just let
her go, just let her go,

01:20:22.989 --> 01:20:24.157
just let her go.

01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:25.892
No, please, Dad, okay
I'll do anything.

01:20:25.925 --> 01:20:27.060
Okay? I'll do anything.

01:20:27.093 --> 01:20:28.928
Just not her, just not h...

01:20:28.962 --> 01:20:30.498
No, no.

01:20:30.531 --> 01:20:32.500
I'll do anything, okay?

01:20:32.533 --> 01:20:33.601
Okay, please.

01:20:34.535 --> 01:20:35.369
Please.

01:20:38.372 --> 01:20:39.607
Please, there.

01:20:39.639 --> 01:20:41.241
There, it's gone.

01:20:41.274 --> 01:20:43.676
Please, Dad, please,
Dad, no, let her go.

01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:44.844
Let her go, okay?

01:20:44.878 --> 01:20:45.745
No, please.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.689
Hey, are you gonna be all right?

01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:35.396
You're not gonna get
rid of me that easily.

01:21:35.429 --> 01:21:36.262
Promise?

01:22:02.222 --> 01:22:03.691
At least we've got blankets.
