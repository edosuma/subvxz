(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.670 --> 00:05.473
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.209
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.242 --> 00:10.078
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.111 --> 00:11.445
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.479 --> 00:13.481
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.716
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.053
(woman singing)
* MY FATHER WAS THE KEEPER

00:19.087 --> 00:20.788
* OF THE EDDYSTONE LIGHT

00:20.821 --> 00:24.658
* AND HE SLEPT WITH A MERMAID
ONE FINE NIGHT *

00:24.692 --> 00:28.429
* OUT OF THIS UNION
THERE CAME THREE *

00:28.462 --> 00:32.666
* A PORPOISE, A PORGY,
AND THE OTHER WAS ME *

00:32.700 --> 00:35.203
* YO-HO-HO

00:35.236 --> 00:38.406
* THE WIND BLOWS FREE

00:38.439 --> 00:43.677
* OVER THE LIFE
OF THE ROLLING SEA *

00:43.711 --> 00:44.678
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

00:44.712 --> 00:45.679
[screams]
GET OUT!

00:45.713 --> 00:46.847
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.282
HEY, RONDA!

00:48.316 --> 00:50.384
RONDA, CALL 911.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.685
TELL THEM WE HAVE
AN INTRUDER!

00:51.719 --> 00:53.854
HEY, HEY,
THAT'S MY SHOWER CURTAIN!

00:53.887 --> 00:55.523
GET BACK HERE!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.625
THIS CRAZY BITCH
TERRIFIED MY FAMILY.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.860
I WANT HER ARRESTED NOW.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.662
SIR, WE HAVE TO LOCATE
THE SUSPECT FIRST.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.596
(Ronda)
HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?

01:02.630 --> 01:05.099
SHE LEFT HER CLOTHES BEHIND,
AND HER WALLET.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.368
YOU GO BACK IN.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.669
(Stabler)
LIV.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.439
PATROL DUMPED
THIS ONE ON US WHY?

01:11.472 --> 01:13.374
BECAUSE A WHACK JOB WAS FOUND
NAKED IN THE SHOWER?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.542
ELLIOT.
LAST WEEK,
IT WAS BECAUSE

01:14.575 --> 01:16.877
A GUY HAD HIS JOHNSON OUT,
TAKING A PISS IN THE ALLEY.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.879
WHAT'S NEXT, FELONY
PUPPY-HUMPING IN THE DOG RUN?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.148
ELLIOT,
I CALLED YOU IN.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.483
WHY, BECAUSE
YOUR SPIDEY SENSE

01:22.516 --> 01:24.385
TELLS YOU SHE WAS
A RAPE VICTIM?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.755
BECAUSE SHE'S
YOUR DAUGHTER.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.430
KATHLEEN.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.350
ELLIOT, YOU CAN'T
INVESTIGATE THIS.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.351
SURE I CAN.
I'M A COP.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.419
NOT TONIGHT.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.686
YOU'RE THE PARENT
OF A PERP.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.455
PATROL ONLY GAVE ME
THE HEADS UP

02:34.488 --> 02:35.589
BECAUSE THEY FOUND
YOUR BUSINESS CARD

02:35.623 --> 02:36.957
IN KATHLEEN'S WALLET.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.526
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
THE PRECINCT SQUAD HANDLE THIS.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.261
I'M GONNA FIND KATHLEEN.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.830
MR. AND MRS. FOSTER, HI.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.533
MY PARTNER TELLS ME YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN THIS YOUNG WOMAN BEFORE?

02:45.566 --> 02:46.934
NEVER.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.936
THERE'S GOTTA BE A CONNECTION
BETWEEN YOU AND HER.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.238
YOU SAYING
WE KNEW THIS PSYCHO?

02:50.271 --> 02:51.038
MAYBE.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.473
MAYBE YOU DON'T REALIZE
FROM WHERE.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.276
DO EITHER OF YOU WORK
AT HUDSON UNIVERSITY?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.510
NO, BUT OUR NEIGHBORS

02:56.544 --> 02:57.445
HAVE A SON WHO GOES THERE,

02:57.478 --> 02:58.979
AND THEY HAD A PARTY
IN THEIR GARDEN TONIGHT.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.748
THAT'S PROBABLY HOW SHE
FOUND HER WAY INTO YOUR HOUSE.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.283
SHE JUST CLIMBED
OVER THE GARDEN WALL,

03:02.316 --> 03:03.417
SAW THE WINDOW OPEN.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.286
I'LL GO TALK
TO THE NEIGHBORS.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.354
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BELIEVE

03:06.387 --> 03:08.256
THAT THIS IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A HARMLESS PRANK.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.790
A PRANK?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.625
SHE BROKE INTO OUR HOUSE,
SHE STRIPPED NAKED,

03:11.659 --> 03:12.793
AND SHE TOOK A SHOWER.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.262
MY BABY WAS ASLEEP
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.963
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN HURT.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.432
BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT THIS WOMAN IS DANGEROUS.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.934
SHE'S JUST A COLLEGE KID...

03:20.968 --> 03:22.770
BEHAVING BADLY.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.472
CAN I GET
YOUR NAME AND BADGE NUMBER?

03:24.505 --> 03:27.975
DETECTIVE STABLER.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.977
OH, NOW I GET IT.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.979
YOU'RE TRYING
TO COVER THIS UP.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.881
NO, NO, MY DAUGHTER
WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.449
GET OUT.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.289
(Will)
I AM SO BUSTED.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.891
STUPID NEIGHBORS
ALWAYS RATTING ME OUT

03:43.924 --> 03:44.858
TO MY PARENTS.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.495
RIGHT, AND I'M SURE
YOU DON'T DESERVE IT.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.929
KATHLEEN CAME BACK
TO THE PARTY AFTER HER SHOWER,

03:48.962 --> 03:50.331
BUT SHE DIDN'T STAY.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.866
WHERE'D SHE GO?
I ALREADY
TOLD HER.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.302
WITH THIS DUDE PORTER,

03:54.335 --> 03:55.135
AND A COUPLE CHICKS
I DON'T KNOW.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.970
I'M WAITING FOR HIM
TO TEXT ME BACK.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.273
HOW DID IT GO
WITH THE FOSTERS?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.008
OH, I STEPPED IN IT.
[phone beeps]

04:01.041 --> 04:02.810
PORTER'S ON HIS WAY HOME
TO SACK OUT.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.045
HE SAID THE GIRLS
WERE HEADING IN

04:05.078 --> 04:08.482
TO RIVERSIDE PARK
AND 83rd STREET.

04:08.516 --> 04:11.285
SHE'S GOT NO MONEY,
SHE'S GOT NO CLOTHES.
ELLIOT,
SHE'S NOT ALONE.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.986
ONE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS
PROBABLY TOOK HER HOME.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.289
THEY'RE ALL DRUNK.
THEY'RE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.290
THEY'D BE WAVING
GOOD-BYE TO HER

04:16.324 --> 04:17.691
IF A TOTAL STRANGER
CAME UP AND OFFERED HER

04:17.725 --> 04:18.726
A RIDE HOME
IN HIS VAN.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.893
YOU CAN'T
THINK LIKE THAT.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.362
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M A CIVILIAN.

04:21.395 --> 04:24.332
HEY.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.667
THERE'S SOMEBODY
ON THE PLAYGROUND.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.969
KATHLEEN!

04:29.002 --> 04:31.305
DADDY!

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
IT'S SO COOL
YOU'RE HERE!

04:34.408 --> 04:36.544
COME ON! YOU GOTTA
COME TRY IT.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.745
IF YOU TILT
YOUR HEAD BACK,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.747
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
FLOATING IN OUTER SPACE

04:39.780 --> 04:41.014
LIKE AN ASTRONAUT
ABOVE SOME FREAKY PLANET.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.318
COME ON!
I DON'T THINK SO,
HONEY.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.019
HEY, OLIVIA!

04:46.053 --> 04:47.020
YOU WANNA
COME PLAY?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.856
UH, THAT'S PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST IDEA, SWEETIE.

04:48.889 --> 04:52.526
COME ON, LET ME--
LET'S GO.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.862
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.029
I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN.
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.431
LET'S GO.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.734
BUT I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT--

05:05.105 --> 05:07.575
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, DAD.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.642
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.777
FINE, YELL AT ME.
I DON'T CARE.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.514
KATHLEEN,
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT WITH YOU.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.384
BUT YOU'RE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE HERE.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.250
YOU BROKE IN
TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.353
I DIDN'T BREAK IN.
THE WINDOW WAS OPEN.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.621
THAT--

05:22.923 --> 05:24.057
DON'T TRY
AND PLAY ME.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.926
YOU KNOW LEGALLY
IT'S A CRIME.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.761
YOU GONNA LOCK ME UP?

05:30.931 --> 05:31.932
I'M GONNA TRY
AND FIX THINGS,

05:31.965 --> 05:34.935
SO THAT
THEY DON'T GET WORSE.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.771
BUT YOU GOTTA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.440
I TOOK SOME PILLS.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.744
WHAT KIND OF PILLS?

05:43.777 --> 05:44.978
I DON'T KNOW.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.015
WHO GAVE THEM
TO YOU?
SOME GIRL.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.652
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN USING?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.721
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I TRIED ANYTHING

05:53.754 --> 05:55.423
HARDER THAN VODKA.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.525
I SWEAR, DAD.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.395
I'M SORRY.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.700
I REALLY SCREWED UP AGAIN.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.135
SHH.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.405
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

06:11.439 --> 06:15.108
I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.445
I MADE YOU
SOME HOT COCOA.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.013
THANKS, MOM.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.617
WHERE YOU GOING?

06:23.651 --> 06:27.020
TO FIND OUT WHO'S
PUSHING PILLS AT HUDSON.

06:30.691 --> 06:34.127
(Julia)
LAST WEEK, I CAME HOME,
SHE WAS PAINTING THE ROOM.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.597
SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO LIVE INSIDE THE SUN.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.666
I NEVER KNOW WHO
I'LL FIND HER WITH.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.734
DO YOU HAVE NAMES

06:40.768 --> 06:42.002
OF THE GUYS
THAT SHE'S DATING?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.971
I DON'T KNOW
THOSE LOSERS' NAMES.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.005
AND I WOULDN'T
CALL IT "DATING."

06:45.038 --> 06:48.108
THEY DO DRUGS?

06:48.141 --> 06:49.510
NOT IN FRONT
OF ME.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.644
WHO'S THE GIRL
WHO'S GIVING HER PILLS?

06:50.678 --> 06:52.212
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.514
I DON'T
DO THAT STUFF.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.783
I DON'T HANG OUT
WITH PEOPLE WHO DO,

06:55.816 --> 06:58.452
LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.953
SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.455
WE USED TO STAY UP
ALL NIGHT

07:01.489 --> 07:04.658
CRAMMING FOR CHEM,
EATING ICE CREAM.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.527
AND THEN SHE STOPPED
GOING TO CLASS,

07:06.560 --> 07:09.196
OR EVEN COMING HOME.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.631
WHEN I ASKED HER
TO STUDY WITH ME,

07:10.664 --> 07:12.800
SHE CALLED ME
A GEEK.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.470
JULIA.

07:16.504 --> 07:22.042
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.078
PLEASE HELP ME.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.854
THERE'S THIS GIRL
NAMED MIKKI BRAITHWAITE.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.791
MIKKI BRAITHWAITE?

07:37.825 --> 07:40.794
OOH, OOH,
IT'S THE BIG BAD WOLF.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.763
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, OFFICER?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.765
I'M KATHLEEN STABLER'S FATHER.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.066
AND YOU ARE HERE
TO TELL ME

07:46.099 --> 07:47.801
I'M A TERRIBLE INFLUENCE
ON DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL?

07:47.835 --> 07:48.902
GET LOST.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.203
GET LOST.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.840
GET OUT OF HERE.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.243
KATHLEEN IS SCREWED UP
ON DRUGS.
SO?

07:56.276 --> 07:58.245
YOU'RE HER FRIEND.
TRY GIVING A DAMN.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.214
GET A LIFE, POPS.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.084
OW, LET GO OF ME,
YOU PERVERT!

08:04.117 --> 08:05.218
OW, YOU'RE
HURTING ME!

08:05.252 --> 08:06.887
HEY, YOU CAN'T
TOUCH MY STUFF!

08:06.920 --> 08:09.923
YEAH?
WATCH ME.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.630
WHAT'S THIS?

08:16.664 --> 08:17.798
MY TAMPONS.
YOU WANT ONE?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.834
TOLD YOU.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.274
WELL, THAT LOOKS
LIKE COCAINE TO ME.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.944
YOU'RE IN
A WORLD OF HURT, GIRL.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.246
NO, YOU ARE,
DETECTIVE STABLER.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.815
I'M UNDERCOVER.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.618
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU PROVE
THAT ONE TO ME, OFFICER MIKKI?

08:37.651 --> 08:38.719
IT'S NIKKI.

08:38.752 --> 08:39.587
DETECTIVE NIKKI BRESLIN.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.622
MANHATTAN SOUTH NARCOTICS.
SHIELD 9598.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.324
NOW, LET'S DANCE.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.826
MAKE IT LOOK REAL,
OR MY COVER'S BLOWN,

08:45.859 --> 08:47.861
AND MY CAPTAIN WILL
HAVE YOUR ASS FOR BREAKFAST.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.705
I'VE BEEN
UNDERCOVER AT HUDSON

08:57.738 --> 08:59.707
SINCE THE START
OF THE FALL TERM.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.609
SOMEONE'S MOVING SOME MAJOR
WEIGHT THROUGH CAMPUS.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.043
I READ ABOUT
THE TWO O.D.s.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.045
THREE, ACTUALLY.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.948
SO NARCOTICS
SENT ME IN.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.049
LUCKY ME,
I GET TO SUFFER

09:09.082 --> 09:10.584
THROUGH BEOWULF
ALL OVER AGAIN.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.786
MM-HMM,
AND HANG WITH MY KID.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.888
SHE TELL YOU
I WAS ON THE JOB?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.724
YEAH.
AND YOU WORKED
HER ANYWAY.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.091
NOT AS A TARGET.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.226
SHE'S NOT DEALING,
DETECTIVE,

09:19.259 --> 09:20.828
JUST USING.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.295
WHAT'S SHE ON?

09:22.329 --> 09:23.697
COKE AND DOWNERS.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.332
SHE GETS REAL HIGH,
AND USES VALIUM

09:25.365 --> 09:26.634
TO SMOOTH OUT
THE CRASH.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.369
GET HER INTO REHAB.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.238
BY NEXT SEMESTER,
SHE'LL BE BACK IN SCHOOL

09:31.271 --> 09:32.239
GETTING STRAIGHT "A"s.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.741
WHO'S DEALING
AT HUDSON?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.143
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT,
AND YOU KNOW BETTER TO ASK.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.044
REALLY?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.612
YOU GIVE OUT SENSITIVE INTEL
TO THE PARENTS

09:38.646 --> 09:39.913
OF KIDS YOU COLLAR?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.782
(Tutuola)
EL.
WHAT?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.818
YOUR WIFE'S DOWNSTAIRS,
AND SHE'S UPSET.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.021
KATHY,
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:48.055 --> 09:50.090
SHE'S GONE.
KATHLEEN'S GONE.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.659
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S GONE?
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.627
SHE SAID SHE WAS HUNGRY,
SO I MADE HER A SANDWICH.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.862
AND WHEN I TOOK IT UP
TO HER ROOM,

09:54.895 --> 09:56.096
SHE'D SNUCK OUT THE WINDOW
AND DOWN THE OAK TREE.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.230
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.298
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
STAY WITH HER?

09:58.331 --> 09:59.667
DON'T BLAME THIS ON ME.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.101
WE'LL FIND HER.
WE'LL FIND HER.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.102
MAYBE SHE WENT
BACK TO HUDSON.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.704
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.138
SHE'S GOT SOME TENSION
WITH HER ROOMMATE.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.206
WHERE DO WE START?

10:06.239 --> 10:07.240
I HAVE AN IDEA.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.676
WHO'S SHE?
IT'S A LONG STORY.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.743
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

10:09.777 --> 10:10.878
THERE'S AN ABANDONED
DRY CLEANERS

10:10.911 --> 10:12.145
ON SECOND AND A,
WHERE HUDSON STUDENTS

10:12.179 --> 10:13.346
HANG OUT AND GET HIGH.

10:17.818 --> 10:18.986
WHAT'S BACK THERE?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.102
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.136
POLICE!
WHOA, WHOA!

10:36.169 --> 10:37.437
SHE PICKED ME UP
IN A BAR.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.706
(Tutuola)
SHUT UP!

10:38.739 --> 10:40.107
KATHLEEN.
KATHLEEN.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.275
KATHLEEN!

10:42.309 --> 10:44.011
KATHLEEN!

10:44.044 --> 10:45.012
SHE'S O.D.'d.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.046
WHAT'S SHE ON?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.715
I DON'T KNOW.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.982
SHE TOOK
A BUNCH OF PILLS.

11:10.437 --> 11:16.443
[coughing and gagging]

11:21.749 --> 11:25.986
[coughing continues]

11:26.019 --> 11:27.855
(Parnell)
WE HAD TO SEDATE HER.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.758
AFTER WE PUMPED HER STOMACH,
SHE BECAME VERY...

11:30.791 --> 11:32.259
AGITATED.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.393
YOUR DAUGHTER
IS VERY SICK.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.461
YOU MEAN
SHE'S A JUNKIE.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.796
NO.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.765
SHE'S SELF-MEDICATING
ON STREET DRUGS

11:37.798 --> 11:39.232
TO COPE
WITH HER ILLNESS.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.367
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.401
WELL, BASED
ON HER BEHAVIOR,

11:41.434 --> 11:42.803
AND THE HISTORY
YOU GAVE US,

11:42.836 --> 11:44.471
KATHLEEN'S DRUG
AND ALCOHOL ABUSE,

11:44.504 --> 11:47.174
THE HYPERSEXUALITY,

11:47.207 --> 11:49.476
THE DWI,
THE CREDIT CARD SHE STOLE,

11:49.509 --> 11:51.311
WE THINK
IT'S BIPOLAR DISORDER.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.814
MY DAUGHTER'S NOT CRAZY.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.515
I DIDN'T SAY
SHE WAS CRAZY.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.950
I SAID SHE'S SICK.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.485
HOW CAN WE HELP HER?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.788
BPD CAN BE MANAGED
WITH MEDICATION.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.156
ONCE WE GET HER ON LITHIUM,
THE CHANCES ARE GOOD

12:03.190 --> 12:04.858
THAT SHE CAN LEAD
A NORMAL LIFE.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.026
I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.062
NO, DON'T GO.
I NEED SOME AIR.

12:15.903 --> 12:20.774
[breathing heavily]

12:20.808 --> 12:22.309
[grunts]

12:24.577 --> 12:25.879
WHATEVER YOU'RE
GOING TO SAY, DON'T.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.247
SOMETHING'S COME UP.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.348
CAN IT WAIT?
NO.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.051
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT IS IT?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.219
THE OWNERS
OF THE HOUSE

12:32.252 --> 12:34.487
THAT KATHLEEN BROKE INTO
FILED A COMPLAINT.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.190
I SAW THAT COMING.
NOT AGAINST YOU.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.826
ON KATHLEEN.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.228
THEY CLAIM
SOME JEWELRY IS MISSING.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.230
A DIAMOND PENDANT.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.497
KATHLEEN WAS WEARING
A DIAMOND PENDANT

12:44.531 --> 12:45.899
WHEN WE FOUND HER
ON THE PLAYGROUND.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.503
CUBIC ZIRCONIA.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.873
I GAVE THAT TO HER
FOR HER 18th BIRTHDAY.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.575
MAYBE THE HOMEOWNERS ARE TRYING
TO PULL AN INSURANCE SCAM.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.378
YOU KNOW, USING THE BREAK IN
TO FILE A FALSE CLAIM.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.914
IT WOULDN'T
BE THE FIRST TIME.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.916
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THEIR LAWYERS HAVE

13:02.950 --> 13:04.184
LODGED A COMPLAINT
WITH THE D.A.'S OFFICE,

13:04.217 --> 13:07.220
DEMANDING HER ARREST.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.293
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.128
MY OFFICE
MAY PROSECUTE YOUR DAUGHTER.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.129
IT'S A MISDEMEANOR.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.331
IT'S CRIMINAL TRESPASS
AT BEST.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.466
IT'S A FELONY NOW.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.135
THAT NECKLACE WAS WORTH
A LOT OF MONEY.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.004
KATHLEEN'S LOOKING AT GRAND
LARCENY THREE, BURG TWO.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.873
HOW ABOUT IF I TALK
TO THE HOMEOWNERS?

13:25.906 --> 13:26.974
THEY'RE CLAIMING
YOU USED YOUR BADGE

13:27.007 --> 13:28.608
TO SWEEP THIS
UNDER THE RUG.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.409
NO, NO, NO, LOOK, I WOULD
HAVE DONE THE SAME THING

13:29.442 --> 13:30.844
EVEN IF KATHLEEN
WEREN'T MY DAUGHTER.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.545
REALLY, HOW MANY JUNKIE THIEVES

13:32.579 --> 13:34.214
YOU LET SLIDE RECENTLY?

13:34.247 --> 13:35.883
LOOK, IF THEY GOT
A BEEF WITH ME,

13:35.916 --> 13:37.851
THEY CAN BRING ME UP
ON CHARGES.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.586
KIM.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.589
MY DAUGHTER'S
IN A BAD WAY RIGHT NOW.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.858
BUT SHE'S A GOOD KID.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.927
SO I HEAR, ELLIOT.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.062
BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:49.096 --> 13:52.099
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES,
DRUG TREATMENT, COUNSELING.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.401
I MEAN, YOU CUT DEALS
EVERY DAY OUT OF HERE.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.603
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T
DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.605
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.975
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.311
GET KATHLEEN
A GOOD LAWYER.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.953
I WON'T LET HER
GO TO RIKERS.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.621
DOCTOR SAID
SHE'S MENTALLY ILL.

14:21.394 --> 14:26.299
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,
IF A DEFENDANT

14:26.333 --> 14:30.470
HAS A DIAGNOSED
PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION,

14:30.503 --> 14:32.272
SHE CAN'T BE ARRESTED

14:32.305 --> 14:35.642
IF SHE'S ADMITTED
TO A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.677
(Maddox)
YOUR NEW A.D.A.'S
A SMART COOKIE.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.446
LOONEY BIN'S
THE SAFEST PLACE TO HIDE

14:39.479 --> 14:41.514
FROM THE LONG ARM
OF THE LAW.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.650
I HAVE TO SAY, ELLIOT,
I'M SURPRISED YOU CALLED ME.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.018
MY DAUGHTER
NEEDED A SHARK.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.519
YOU'RE THE DEADLIEST
ONE I KNOW.
THANKS.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.088
LOOK, IF I COULD GET
THE NECKLACE BACK,

14:48.121 --> 14:49.322
DO YOU THINK WE COULD
DO SOME HORSE TRADING?

14:49.356 --> 14:51.124
MAYBE SWAP IT
FOR A WALK?
DON'T.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.226
IF YOU ADMIT KATHLEEN
HAS THE NECKLACE,

14:53.260 --> 14:54.594
THEN YOU'RE HANDING THEM
THE EVIDENCE TO CONVICT HER

14:54.627 --> 14:56.930
ON THE LARCENY CHARGE.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.932
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO KATHLEEN.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.133
NO, NO, NO.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.334
YOU'RE NOT GOING AT HER
WITHOUT ME IN THERE.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.702
I'M NOT GOING
AT HER AT ALL.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.204
I'M ON YOUR SIDE THIS TIME.
TRY TO REMEMBER THAT.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.472
I WILL.
I'M STILL GOING IN THERE.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.241
ONLY IF YOU WANT TO BE CALLED AS
A WITNESS AGAINST YOUR DAUGHTER.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.577
YOU KNOW
A THIRD PARTY IN A ROOM

15:10.610 --> 15:13.013
NULLIFIES
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE.

15:13.046 --> 15:17.951
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE GENTLE.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.953
(Benson)
ELLIOT.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.722
DETECTIVES JAWARSKI
AND CORMAN

15:22.755 --> 15:24.157
FROM THE D.A.'S SQUAD.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.325
SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES,

15:25.358 --> 15:26.659
BUT WE GOTTA
TAKE HER IN.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.028
SHE'S BEING ADMITTED
AS A PSYCH PATIENT.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.662
SMART MOVE.
IT'S NOT A GAME.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.731
(Kathleen)
I'M NOT CRAZY!

15:31.764 --> 15:33.066
HONEY.
GO BACK INSIDE, BABY.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.667
NO, THIS BITCH WANTS
TO LOCK ME UP!

15:34.701 --> 15:37.237
SHH, NO, NO, NO.
THEY DO.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.405
FINE.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.672
TAKE ME AWAY, BOYS.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.008
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.043
I'M NOT GOING
TO THE NUTHOUSE.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.677
YOU'RE GOING IF I HAVE
TO COMMIT YOU MYSELF.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.113
YOU CAN'T.
KATHLEEN'S 19.

15:46.146 --> 15:46.980
LEGALLY,
IT'S HER CHOICE.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.316
SHE'S IN NO SHAPE
TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.084
(Maddox)
DOCTOR SAID SHE'S NOT A DANGER
TO HERSELF OR OTHERS.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.686
WITHOUT SHOWING HOMICIDAL

15:53.720 --> 15:55.388
OR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR,

15:55.422 --> 15:58.058
THEY CANNOT FORCIBLY
COMMIT HER.
TOLD YOU.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.559
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO HELP ME WITH HER.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.727
SHE'S MY CLIENT,
ELLIOT, NOT YOU.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.262
I'VE GOT TO RESPECT
HER WISHES,

16:02.295 --> 16:03.363
EVEN IF I DON'T
AGREE WITH THEM.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.464
COME HERE, COME HERE.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.033
LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME!

16:06.066 --> 16:07.234
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
TO CENTRAL BOOKING.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.102
ARRAIGNMENTS ARE DOWN
FOR THE WEEK,

16:09.136 --> 16:10.470
AND THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GONNA BE IN A CELL

16:10.503 --> 16:12.539
WITH THE SCUM OF THE EARTH
UNTIL MONDAY MORNING.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.640
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

16:13.673 --> 16:14.641
SO?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.077
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO LISTEN TO YOUR DAD?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.145
I'M SICK OF HIM
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.612
THIS IS MY LIFE!

16:19.646 --> 16:20.780
KATHLEEN STABLER, YOU'RE UNDER
ARREST FOR BURGLARY...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.382
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.
AND GRAND LARCENY.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.716
DETECTIVE, STEP BACK,
OR YOU'RE A COLLAR.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.584
YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING
WITH YOUR PARTNER HERE?

16:24.617 --> 16:25.452
ELLIOT, YOU GOTTA LET
THIS PLAY OUT.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.320
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.056
LISTEN TO ME.
I'LL GO WITH HER.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.091
AND I WILL STAY WITH HER
AS LONG AS I CAN.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.435
BREATHE, YOU TWO.
SHE'S FINE.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.303
YOU SAW KATHLEEN?

16:43.336 --> 16:46.139
I JUST CAME BACK
FROM CENTRAL BOOKING.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.575
SHE'S ENTERTAINING
THE ENTIRE HOLDING CELL.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.411
THE HOOKERS REALLY LOVE
HER VERSION OF I WILL SURVIVE.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.445
SHE'S MANIC.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.381
BUT SHE'S
PERFECTLY SAFE.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.415
SHE'S OKAY
TILL ARRAIGNMENT.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.250
AND THEN WHAT?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.618
THE D.A.'S AMENABLE
TO A LESSER CHARGE.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.289
BUT THE VICTIMS
ARE OUT FOR BLOOD.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.656
WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.258
KATHLEEN REFUSES
TO ADMIT

17:05.292 --> 17:08.261
SHE HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS,
SO THE PSYCH DEFENSE IS OUT.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.462
WE'LL HAVE TO GO
ON THE OFFENSIVE.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.563
PUT THE VICTIMS ON TRIAL.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.299
IT'S GOOD,
ISN'T IT?

17:12.332 --> 17:13.700
WAIT, I--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.603
THE HOMEOWNERS CLAIM
KATHLEEN BROKE IN.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.206
BUT THE HUSBAND WENT NEXT DOOR
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSIC.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.707
HE COULD HAVE MET
KATHLEEN AT THE PARTY,

17:20.740 --> 17:22.309
SNUCK HER
INSIDE HIS HOUSE

17:22.342 --> 17:23.443
FOR A LITTLE
SHOWER SCENE.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.278
THE WIFE WAKES UP.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.247
HE CONCOCTS
THE INTRUDER STORY

17:27.280 --> 17:29.116
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN

17:29.149 --> 17:31.384
THE NAKED GIRL
IN HIS BATHROOM.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.286
YOU WANT TO LIE
TO THE JUDGE?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.488
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT, KATHY.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.125
KATHLEEN KNOWS.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.860
I DON'T WANT THE TRUTH,
I JUST NEED PLAUSIBLE STORY

17:40.893 --> 17:43.130
THAT GIVES THE JURY
REASONABLE DOUBT.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.201
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE DIRTY TRICKS

17:48.235 --> 17:49.269
THAT DEFENSE ATTORNEYS PLAY,
AND NOW YOU WANT TO DO--

17:49.302 --> 17:51.304
THAT'S WORK.
THIS IS ABOUT KATHLEEN.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.472
NO, THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.241
DON'T GO THERE.
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.409
DON'T GO THERE.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.477
IS THERE SOME HISTORY HERE?

17:57.510 --> 17:58.711
SOME SKELETONS
IN THE CLOSET

17:58.745 --> 18:01.248
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

18:01.281 --> 18:05.685
BIPOLAR DISORDER
RUNS IN FAMILIES.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.487
IF WE COULD
SHOW THE COURT

18:07.520 --> 18:09.456
THAT KATHLEEN
IS PREDISPOSED TO BPD,

18:09.489 --> 18:10.857
THEN THE JUDGE
MIGHT CONSIDER

18:10.890 --> 18:12.625
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.694
RIGHT, PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT
INSTEAD OF JAIL.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.429
(Maddox)
YES.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.864
BUT IT'LL ONLY HAPPEN
IF KATHLEEN ADMITS SHE'S SICK.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.300
SHE WON'T.
SHE WON'T.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.868
OR WE CAN SHOW
A FAMILY HISTORY.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.103
IT'S UP TO YOU, ELLIOT.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.544
[doorbell rings]

18:31.578 --> 18:35.648
COMING, GLADYS, THEY WON'T MIND
IF I'M FIVE MINUTES--

18:39.919 --> 18:40.920
ELLIOT.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.323
HI, MOM.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.295
WELL, UH, COME IN, COME IN!

18:50.230 --> 18:53.666
UM, I JUST HAVE TO MAKE
ONE PHONE CALL.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.635
SIT DOWN.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.505
JUST TOSS THE MAGAZINES.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.908
GLADYS, BERNADETTE.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.344
I CAN'T GO
WITH YOU TODAY.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.546
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.181
MY SON IS HERE.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.450
RIGHT.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.485
OKAY, I'LL TALK TO YOU.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.920
OKAY, THAT'S DONE.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.922
I'LL JUST GET
SOME LEMONADE.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.457
NO, I'M FINE, MAMA.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.327
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.429
OH, IT'S HOT
AS HADES OUT THERE.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.565
I HOPE YOU HAVE
AIR CONDITIONING.

19:25.598 --> 19:29.802
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE OCEAN AIR
IS SO WONDERFUL.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.872
I JUST--I CAN'T BRING MYSELF
TO SHUT IT OUT.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.842
IT'S SO WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU, ELLIOT.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.446
YOU LOOK GREAT.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.948
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
I DON'T KNOW.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.951
A COUPLE YEARS.

19:44.984 --> 19:48.488
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME
WHEN ELI WAS BORN.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.657
KATHY DID.
WELL...

19:50.690 --> 19:53.993
HOW IS EVERYONE?
EVERYONE'S FINE.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.429
UH, YOU'RE LYING.

19:56.463 --> 19:59.399
I CAN ALWAYS TELL.
YOU SQUINT.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.534
KATHLEEN GOT ARRESTED.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.942
BUT YOU'RE
TAKING CARE OF IT?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.043
I'M TRYING.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.413
I MEAN, YOU KNOW A LOT
OF PEOPLE, YOU CAN PULL STRINGS.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.415
PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.417
I NEED YOUR HELP.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.451
MINE?

20:18.485 --> 20:20.320
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED
FOR MY HELP

20:20.353 --> 20:21.388
SINCE I TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO RIDE A BICYCLE.

20:21.421 --> 20:25.692
MAMA.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.861
KATHLEEN, SHE'S GOT
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.865
AW, LITTLE KATIE.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.467
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.470
THE DOCTOR SAYS
SHE'S BIPOLAR.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.871
SHE'S MANIC-DEPRESSIVE.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.973
DOCTORS?
THOSE IDIOTS.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.411
SHE'S JUST HIGH-SPIRITED.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.578
SHE GETS IT FROM ME.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.514
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.449
WHY?

20:49.482 --> 20:52.919
I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO THE JUDGE.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.488
AND SAY WHAT, EXACTLY?

20:57.757 --> 20:58.825
THAT YOU HAVE
PROBLEMS TOO.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.727
ME?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.061
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.396
MOM, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.464
NO.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.433
WHAT--

21:06.466 --> 21:07.500
THE MOOD SWINGS.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.569
YOUR IDEAS.
THE CRAZY IDEAS.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.439
WHAT CRAZY IDEAS?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.941
MAMA.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.976
HITCHHIKING TO SANTA FE
TO MEET GEORGIA O'KEEFE.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.379
WELL, THE WOMAN
WAS A GENIUS.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.647
COPS SAW YOU
ON THE SIDE OF THE BQE,

21:20.680 --> 21:21.881
PICKED YOU UP
IN YOUR SLIP.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.485
WELL, I WAS WEARING IT
AS A COCKTAIL DRESS.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.553
WHEN I WAS TEN,
YOU WANTED TO GO TO PARIS

21:26.586 --> 21:27.454
TO BE A PAINTER.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.355
BUT I AM A PAINTER.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.523
LOOK, THEY SELL MY WORK
ON THE BOARDWALK.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.592
YOU TOOK ME
TO THE AIRPORT

21:32.625 --> 21:33.793
AND TRIED TO BUY TICKETS
WITH YOUR MACY'S CARD.

21:33.826 --> 21:37.864
THAT WAS THE ONLY
CREDIT CARD YOUR FATHER

21:37.897 --> 21:39.899
WOULD ALLOW ME TO HAVE.
AND DAD PICKED US UP
AT JFK--

21:39.932 --> 21:40.767
NO, IT WAS IDLEWILD.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.569
EVERY TIME HE BROUGHT
YOU BACK HOME,

21:42.602 --> 21:43.636
YOU GOT INTO BED,

21:43.670 --> 21:44.671
AND YOU STAYED THERE
FOR A MONTH.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.105
YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS UPSET.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.441
BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO CRUSH MY DREAMS.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.642
THEY'RE FANTASIES.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.611
[stutters]

21:51.644 --> 21:55.548
FANTASIES.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.083
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
YOUR FATHER.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.085
ALL BUTTONED UP.

21:59.118 --> 22:02.622
NO IMAGINATION,
NO SPIRIT.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.458
IF ANYTHING IS JUST A LITTLE
OUT OF THE ORDINARY,

22:05.492 --> 22:08.461
IT SCARES YOU
TO DEATH, DOESN'T IT?

22:08.495 --> 22:12.965
ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T FIT
INTO YOUR NEAT LITTLE BOXES,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.066
YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE IT.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.603
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT ME.

22:16.636 --> 22:20.006
I NEED YOU TO HELP
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER KATHLEEN.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.674
[seethes]

22:21.708 --> 22:24.511
WELL, JUST HELP HER YOURSELF.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.612
JUST GO TELL THE JUDGE
THAT YOUR MOTHER'S

22:25.645 --> 22:26.813
NUTTIER THAN A FRUITCAKE.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.681
MOM, I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO THE JUDGE.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.521
MOM, MOM,
DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.056
I NEED SOME AIR.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.692
MOM.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.629
MOM.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.531
LOOK, I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO UPSET YOU.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.865
YOU DIDN'T?

22:45.898 --> 22:48.868
I JUST WANT
TO HELP KATHLEEN.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.970
MOM.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.540
ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE RIGHT?
THE DOCTORS?

22:53.573 --> 22:56.576
I'M SURE.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.780
WAS I A BAD MOTHER?

23:00.813 --> 23:03.783
NO.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.685
WELL THEN, HOW COME
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

23:05.718 --> 23:07.086
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, HUH?

23:07.119 --> 23:09.456
EVERY TIME I GO TO THE CITY,
I SEE KATHY AND THE KIDS,

23:09.489 --> 23:11.624
BUT YOU'RE NEVER HOME.

23:11.658 --> 23:12.825
MOM, IT'S A JOB.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.127
THINGS COME UP.
I GOTTA DO OVERTIME.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.597
I HEARD THAT LINE
FOR 27 YEARS.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.799
EVERY TIME YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING,

23:19.832 --> 23:21.734
HE SUDDENLY HAD
TO PULL A DOUBLE.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.637
YOU'VE BEEN
AVOIDING ME.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.673
I'M AVOIDING YOU?
YES.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.040
THE MINUTE DAD DIES,
YOU SELL THE HOUSE

23:28.074 --> 23:29.842
AND LEAVE TOWN,
AND I'M AVOIDING YOU?

23:29.876 --> 23:30.977
WELL, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

23:31.010 --> 23:32.579
SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE ON MY KNEES,

23:32.612 --> 23:35.615
SAYING MY ROSARY, AND PRAYING
FOR HIS IMMORTAL SOUL?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.683
HE SURE AS HELL
NEEDED IT.

23:36.716 --> 23:40.920
[laughs]
AND THEN SOME.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.755
THAT LIFE WASN'T FOR ME.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.491
I FELT LIKE
I WAS SUFFOCATING,

23:44.524 --> 23:45.992
LIKE I WOULD--
I WOULD DIE

23:46.025 --> 23:47.627
IF I SPENT
ANOTHER MINUTE THERE.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.498
HERE, AT LEAST
I CAN BREATHE.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.199
COULDN'T BREATHE
AROUND YOUR SON?

23:54.734 --> 23:57.670
YOU DIDN'T NEED ME.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.739
UNTIL NOW.
YOU'RE WRONG.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.610
I ALWAYS NEED YOU
IN MY LIFE.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.248
BUT IT WASN'T YOUR LIFE.
IT ISN'T YOUR LIFE.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.885
YOU'RE LIVING YOUR
FATHER'S LIFE ALL OVER AGAIN.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.954
IF YOU COULD ONLY FIND A WAY
TO BE YOUR OWN MAN.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.055
I KNEW
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.057
HEY, YOU WANTED
TO BE AN ARCHITECT.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.526
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.693
WAIT A MINUTE, I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE AN ARCHITECT.

24:20.727 --> 24:21.694
I WANTED
TO BE A COP.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.063
OH, NO,
YOU WERE VERY TALENTED.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.699
YOU USED TO BUILD
THE MOST AMAZING BUILDINGS

24:26.733 --> 24:28.000
WITH YOUR BLOCKS,
AND YOUR LEGOS.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.502
I WAS EIGHT
YEARS OLD.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.938
YOU WOULD SKETCH
THESE FANTASTIC CITIES...

24:31.971 --> 24:34.841
I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.
WITH SKYSCRAPERS GOING UP
TO THE HEAVENS.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.108
IT WAS KID STUFF.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.110
IT WAS YOUR PASSION.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.813
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
WHERE DID IT GO?

24:40.847 --> 24:42.649
INTO RESPONSIBILITIES.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.518
INTO TAKING CARE
OF MY CHILDREN.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.653
I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY
OF STAYING IN BED FOR A MONTH

24:46.686 --> 24:48.821
WHEN THINGS DON'T GO MY WAY.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.289
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
LISTEN TO ME.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.824
PLEASE HELP ME.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.726
PLEASE HELP ME.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.128
JUST ADMIT YOU'RE SICK.
ELLIOT.

24:56.162 --> 25:00.833
IF YOU--IF YOU COULD JUST
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

25:00.867 --> 25:03.570
AND SMELL
THE OCEAN AIR,

25:03.603 --> 25:08.708
FEEL THE SUN ON YOUR FACE, THE
WIND, THE SAND BENEATH YOUR--

25:08.741 --> 25:10.843
OH, I KNOW.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.179
LET'S BUILD
A SAND CASTLE.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.714
OKAY?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.883
LIKE WE USED TO
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.286
REMEMBER THAT SUMMER
THAT WE RENTED A COTTAGE

25:20.319 --> 25:22.822
IN WILDWOOD
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER?

25:22.855 --> 25:25.091
AND YOU USED TO COME OUT
EVERY MORNING AND START DIGGING.

25:25.124 --> 25:29.161
AND THEN BY SUNSET, YOU'D HAVE
THIS WHOLE METROPOLIS.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.732
THEN YOU'D CRY
LIKE A BABY

25:32.765 --> 25:36.168
WHEN THE TIDE CAME
AND WASHED IT ALL AWAY.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.738
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT SUMMER?

25:38.771 --> 25:41.574
HUH?

25:41.608 --> 25:43.576
THE NIGHT YOU TOLD DAD
YOU WERE LEAVING US.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.745
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

25:45.778 --> 25:48.881
RUNNING AROUND, SHOUTING HOW
YOU NEEDED TO BE FREE.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.784
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME SHELLS FOR THE--

25:51.818 --> 25:53.352
FOR THE WINDOWS.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.754
WHEN DAD PICKED ME UP
IN HIS ARMS,

25:54.787 --> 25:55.888
YOU RAN OFF
AND GOT HIS GUN.

25:55.922 --> 25:56.956
THREATENED TO KILL YOURSELF,

25:56.989 --> 25:58.224
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

25:58.257 --> 26:01.060
OH, YEAH, AND--
AND SOME PEBBLES FOR THE MOAT.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.662
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM
LAUGHING AT YOU,

26:02.695 --> 26:03.796
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY
THE MILLIONTH TIME

26:03.830 --> 26:06.899
THAT HE'D HEARD
THAT FROM YOU?

26:06.933 --> 26:09.368
AND WHEN I CRIED,
YOU LIFTED UP THE REVOLVER

26:09.401 --> 26:10.870
AND YOU SHOT AT US.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.772
I KNOW...

26:12.805 --> 26:15.141
WE'LL NEED SEAWEED
FOR RAPUNZEL'S HAIR

26:15.174 --> 26:17.176
HANGING DOWN
FROM THE TOWER.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.045
I REMEMBER THAT
CRAZED LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.614
OH, THIS IS GONNA
BE GOOD.

26:21.648 --> 26:25.051
I WONDERED WHY YOU HATED US
SO MUCH, YOU WANTED US DEAD.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.719
COME ON, ELLIOT.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.754
WE NEED STICKS
FOR THE DRAWBRIDGE.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.857
STOP IT, STOP IT!
WHAT?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.259
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

26:36.896 --> 26:41.000
IT'S OKAY.
I CAN DO IT AGAIN.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.338
GOOD-BYE, MOM.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.992
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT MY DAUGHTER DID.
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.227
A PRETTY SPEECH ISN'T GOING
TO MAKE ME DROP THE CHARGES.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.299
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO.

27:17.770 --> 27:22.141
THAT WAS RONDA'S
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.343
SHE'LL BE HAPPY
TO HAVE IT BACK.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.378
KATHLEEN TOOK IT.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.851
WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME COULD PUT
YOUR DAUGHTER BEHIND BARS.

27:31.884 --> 27:35.087
YES.

27:37.924 --> 27:41.894
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE HER.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.934
(Clerk)
DOCKET ENDING 0401.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.401
PEOPLE OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK

27:49.435 --> 27:51.838
VERSUS
KATHLEEN LOUISE STABLER.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.339
HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

27:53.372 --> 27:55.775
UH, SORRY.
NOT GUILTY.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.209
BAIL?

27:57.243 --> 27:59.178
THE PEOPLE REQUEST
REMAND, YOUR HONOR.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.179
THE DEFENDANT'S
A FLIGHT RISK.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.716
A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

28:03.750 --> 28:06.018
WHOSE POLICE OFFICER FATHER
IS IN THE COURTROOM,

28:06.052 --> 28:08.354
READY TO GUARANTEE HER
CONTINUED APPEARANCE, PLEASE.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.023
SHE ALREADY ABSCONDED
FROM HER PARENTS' CARE.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.959
THAT'S PRE-ARREST.
THAT'S A FAMILY MATTER.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.895
YOUR HONOR, THIS IS A CLASSIC
CASE OF OVERCHARGING.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.029
IT'S A MISDEMEANOR
AT BEST.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.364
(Torres)
SHE STOLE A DIAMOND NECKLACE.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.832
THAT'S A FELONY.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.367
THE VICTIM'S PROPERTY
WAS RECOVERED

28:21.400 --> 28:24.136
FROM THE DEFENDANT
BY HER OWN FATHER.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.938
ELLIOT?
DAD?

28:28.074 --> 28:30.209
I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU!

28:30.242 --> 28:31.377
(Ridenaur)
ORDER!

28:31.410 --> 28:32.745
KISS MY ASS, BITCH!

28:32.779 --> 28:33.746
REMOVE THE DEFENDANT.

28:33.780 --> 28:34.947
DON'T TOUCH ME!

28:34.981 --> 28:37.917
NO, DADDY.
DADDY, HELP ME!

28:37.950 --> 28:39.218
HELP ME.
THEY'RE HURTING ME!

28:40.286 --> 28:41.287
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO?

28:41.320 --> 28:42.889
SHE NEEDS HELP.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.757
YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
SHE'S GONNA GET AT RIKERS?

28:44.791 --> 28:46.358
WHY DIDN'T
YOU COME TO ME?
YOU WERE
TRYING TO GET HER OFF.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.894
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU HIRED ME TO DO?

28:47.927 --> 28:49.095
WELL, I CHANGED MY MIND.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.229
IF SHE SAYS SHE'S NOT
GOING TO THE HOSPITAL,

28:50.262 --> 28:52.198
SHE'LL BE FORCIBLY
MEDICATED IN JAIL.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.365
YOU BASTARD!

28:55.802 --> 28:57.236
[sighs]

29:03.475 --> 29:05.778
[door opens]

29:05.812 --> 29:06.846
KATHY CALLED?

29:06.879 --> 29:10.950
YEAH.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.785
I'M IN THE DOG HOUSE
WITH HER.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.087
YEAH.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.890
AND YOU TOO?

29:17.924 --> 29:18.724
ELLIOT.

29:18.757 --> 29:23.863
WE'VE BEEN PARTNERS
FOR 11 YEARS.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.866
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.937
EVEN THE PARTS
THAT I'D RATHER FORGET.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.139
HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.841
NEVER CAME UP.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.175
YOU MADE SURE
IT NEVER CAME UP.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.044
LIV, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO TELL YOU?

29:38.077 --> 29:40.212
THINGS HAPPEN,
I DEAL WITH IT.

29:40.246 --> 29:43.249
I MOVE ON.
I'M NOT GOING TO WALLOW IN IT.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.458
ELLIOT, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

29:52.491 --> 29:56.996
BOTTLING IT UP INSIDE
HASN'T WORKED FOR YOU.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.031
AND NEITHER HAS
BEATING UP PERPS, OR WALLS,

29:59.065 --> 30:03.135
OR GARBAGE CANS.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.371
KATHLEEN MAY BE SICK.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.174
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEM.

30:14.313 --> 30:18.017
I'M THROUGH
THE LOOKING GLASS HERE, LIV.

30:21.287 --> 30:25.091
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE
MY DAUGHTER LOCKED UP OR...

30:27.059 --> 30:28.560
GLAD SHE'S IN RIKERS.

30:28.594 --> 30:32.364
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.503
IT WAS THE ONLY
OPTION I HAD.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.348
[door closes]

30:51.683 --> 30:53.119
(Waitress)
CAN I WARM THAT UP?

30:53.152 --> 30:54.253
(Benson)
YES, THANK YOU.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.360
OLIVIA BENSON?

31:01.393 --> 31:04.263
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D MEET.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.898
MRS. STABLER,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.334
OH, BERNIE, PLEASE.

31:08.367 --> 31:13.272
I HAVEN'T BEEN MRS. ANYTHING
FOR AN AWFULLY LONG TIME.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.406
WHAT CAN I GET
FOR YOU, HON?

31:14.440 --> 31:18.344
I'LL JUST HAVE
SOME WATER, PLEASE.

31:18.377 --> 31:22.248
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY YOU SCARE
THE PANTS OFF OF KATHY.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.617
I WAS ALWAYS GRATEFUL
THAT THERE WEREN'T WOMEN

31:25.651 --> 31:28.187
IN THE DEPARTMENT
IN MY DAY.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.056
OF COURSE,

31:30.089 --> 31:34.160
JOE MADE DO
WITH CHASING NURSES.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.394
THANK YOU.

31:41.667 --> 31:46.205
DOES HE EVER
TALK ABOUT ME?

31:46.238 --> 31:50.977
TODAY WAS THE FIRST TIME.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.045
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT, UH--

31:53.079 --> 31:55.547
I WAS DEAD?

31:55.581 --> 31:58.117
YEAH, MY BOY PLAYS IT

31:58.150 --> 32:00.953
PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE VEST.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.222
GETS THAT
FROM HIS FATHER.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.694
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT--

32:08.727 --> 32:12.431
FIRST, LET ME
SHOW YOU SOMETHING, OKAY?

32:19.171 --> 32:20.339
THERE.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.709
THAT WAS
THE THANKSGIVING DAY PAGEANT.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.211
HE WAS A CARROT.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.178
YEAH, I MADE THAT MYSELF

32:26.212 --> 32:29.215
OUT OF ORANGE FELT
AND GREEN FEATHERS.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.450
I REMEMBER HIS FATHER SAYING,

32:31.483 --> 32:33.152
"WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S NOT A FRUIT."

32:33.185 --> 32:36.688
(Benson)
THE YOUNGEST PICTURE
I'VE EVER SEEN OF ELLIOT

32:36.722 --> 32:39.658
IS THE DAY HE ENTERED
THE ACADEMY.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.528
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S
ERASED HIS CHILDHOOD.

32:46.332 --> 32:52.671
SEE, I...
I MADE CERTAIN CHOICES.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.707
AND I LOST MY SON.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.512
THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME
THE PHOTOS.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.747
WELL, IT WAS--

33:01.780 --> 33:04.450
IT WAS SELFISH.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.518
I JUST NEEDED YOU TO KNOW.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.288
KNOW WHAT?

33:12.124 --> 33:15.127
THAT I TRIED
TO BE A GOOD MOTHER.

33:20.366 --> 33:23.235
ELLIOT IS A GOOD MAN.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.337
AND I KNOW HIM
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW

33:25.371 --> 33:27.473
THAT HE DIDN'T
GET IT FROM HIS FATHER.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.542
THANK YOU FOR THAT, DEAR.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.812
SEE, HE WAS ALWAYS EMBARRASSED

33:33.845 --> 33:36.348
ABOUT MY FLAMBOYANCE.

33:36.382 --> 33:41.320
HE WOULD'VE LIKED
A MORE CONVENTIONAL MOTHER.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.756
SO YOU WERE ALWAYS...

33:44.790 --> 33:47.259
DIFFERENT.
YEAH.

33:47.293 --> 33:51.197
MY MOTHER USED TO CALL ME
A FLIBBERTIGIBBET.

33:51.230 --> 33:54.266
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED
OF BEING IMPULSIVE,

33:54.300 --> 33:57.736
IRRESPONSIBLE, FLIGHTY.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.339
AND THOSE ARE JUST
THE G-RATED WORDS.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.474
BUT YOU NEVER
SAW A DOCTOR?

34:02.508 --> 34:04.576
IN MY DAY,

34:04.610 --> 34:08.347
ECCENTRICITY WAS--
WAS TOLERATED.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.516
YOU KNOW, NOW THEY'VE GOT
A PILL FOR EVERYTHING.

34:10.549 --> 34:15.287
DID YOU EVER
TRY MEDICATION?

34:18.290 --> 34:21.293
ONCE.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.228
I, UM--

34:22.261 --> 34:27.366
I HAD A FIGHT WITH JOE.

34:27.399 --> 34:31.437
AND HIS GUN WENT OFF.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.340
HE HAD ME COMMITTED.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.312
AND THEY TIED ME DOWN.

34:40.346 --> 34:45.351
AND THEY FORCED PILLS
DOWN MY THROAT.

34:45.384 --> 34:49.155
I FELT LIKE
AN EMPTY SHELL.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.391
LIKE SOMEONE HAD
REACHED INSIDE OF ME

34:52.424 --> 34:57.263
AND SCOOPED OUT MY SOUL.

34:57.296 --> 35:01.333
AND I WOULD RATHER BE DEAD
THAN GO TO THAT PLACE AGAIN.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.737
YOU KNOW?

35:05.771 --> 35:08.340
SO I MEAN,
I AM WHAT I AM.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.442
I ACCEPT MYSELF.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.511
AND I LIVE LIFE
ON MY OWN TERMS.

35:14.613 --> 35:18.217
BUT YOU PAY
A PRETTY STEEP PRICE.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.287
YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE I DO.

35:21.320 --> 35:25.291
BUT IT'S MY LIFE.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.559
AND I'M NOT GONNA GO
PARADING MYSELF

35:27.593 --> 35:29.328
IN FRONT
OF SOME COURT

35:29.361 --> 35:33.365
AND ANNOUNCE
TO THE WORLD

35:33.399 --> 35:36.402
THAT I'M CRAZY.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.374
BUT WOULD YOU DO IT
FOR YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.485
GRANDMA B?

35:53.519 --> 35:56.355
OH, MY LITTLE KATIE.
COME HERE, BABY.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.424
GOT TWO,
THREE MINUTES,

35:58.457 --> 35:59.425
AND I GOTTA
GET HER BACK.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.593
OKAY.
I OWE YOU BIG TIME.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.265
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HERE.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.333
WELL,

36:07.366 --> 36:09.368
HOW COULD I MISS
THE OPPORTUNITY

36:09.401 --> 36:12.304
TO SEE HOW RAVISHING
YOU ARE IN DAY-GLO?

36:17.976 --> 36:19.378
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN
GETTING YOURSELF

36:19.411 --> 36:21.547
INTO ALL KINDS
OF TROUBLE, HUH?

36:21.580 --> 36:22.948
ARE YOU GONNA
YELL AT ME TOO?

36:22.981 --> 36:26.585
ME?
YOUR PARTNER IN CRIME?

36:26.618 --> 36:28.454
[laughs]

36:28.487 --> 36:31.357
REMEMBER WHEN WE TOOK
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S FEDORA

36:31.390 --> 36:34.560
FOR THE SNOWMAN,
AND HIS LAST CUBAN CIGAR?

36:34.593 --> 36:35.894
HE WAS PRETTY PISSED.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.497
BUT YOU TOLD HIM
TO GET STUFFED.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.368
YEAH, WELL, I WAS TRYING
NOT TO CURSE IN FRONT OF YOU.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.370
AS IF THE F-BOMB DOESN'T
GET DROPPED AT MY HOUSE.

36:44.403 --> 36:48.240
USUALLY AT ME.

36:54.480 --> 36:58.450
GRANDMA?

36:58.484 --> 37:00.686
DO YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY?

37:00.719 --> 37:03.289
DO YOU FEEL CRAZY?

37:03.322 --> 37:04.823
I DON'T KNOW.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.826
IT'S LIKE THE WORLD IS FULL
OF THESE TINGLING FORCE FIELDS,

37:07.859 --> 37:09.561
AND EVERYTHING I TOUCH
MAKES ME SHIVER.

37:09.595 --> 37:13.832
YEAH, AND THEN,
SOMETIMES, JUST THE THOUGHT

37:13.865 --> 37:16.435
OF GETTING OUT OF BED
MAKES YOU SO TIRED,

37:16.468 --> 37:18.003
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED
A 12-HOUR NAP?

37:18.036 --> 37:19.771
YEAH.

37:19.805 --> 37:25.511
WELL, THAT'S THE PRICE
WE PAY FOR GREATNESS, HONEY.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.747
THE HIGHER YOU FLY,
THE FARTHER YOU FALL.

37:28.780 --> 37:33.452
WELL, THIS TIME,
I CRASHED AND BURNED.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.954
DAD HATES ME.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.556
NO, HE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.592
BELIEVE ME,
IF HE HATED YOU,

37:40.626 --> 37:44.463
HE'D JUST WALK RIGHT OUT
OF YOUR LIFE.

37:44.496 --> 37:47.333
I'M IN JAIL.
HE PUT ME HERE.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.368
NO, YOU PUT YOURSELF HERE.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.836
SO YOU CAME HERE TO TELL ME
YOU AGREE WITH HIM?

37:58.644 --> 38:01.647
UM...

38:04.450 --> 38:08.086
IN 1969, THERE WAS
THIS AMAZING SNOWSTORM.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.823
IT WAS A BLIZZARD; EVERYBODY
WAS SNOWBOUND FOR DAYS.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.560
EVERYONE EXCEPT ME
AND YOUR FATHER.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.662
I DROVE US
INTO THE CITY.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.434
WE WERE THE ONLY CAR
ON BROADWAY.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.103
IT WAS JUST GLORIOUS.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.906
I DROVE FASTER
AND FASTER.

38:27.939 --> 38:33.044
I FELT LIKE I WAS DRIVING
A MAGICAL SLEIGH.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.646
AND YOUR FATHER WAS SCARED.

38:34.680 --> 38:39.685
HE KEPT SHOUTING
"STOP, MOMMY, STOP!"

38:39.718 --> 38:44.022
BUT I WAS CHASING SNOWFLAKES.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.058
SO MANY
BEAUTIFUL SNOWFLAKES.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.933
UNTIL I CHASED ONE
INTO A LAMPPOST.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.673
I TOTALED THE CAR.

39:04.643 --> 39:08.079
AND I BROKE
YOUR DADDY'S ARM.

39:12.117 --> 39:15.454
HE NEVER TOLD ME
THAT STORY.

39:15.487 --> 39:20.726
NO, HE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.462
SEE, WE ALL
MAKE MISTAKES, KATIE.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.797
THERE'S NO SHAME IN THAT.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.800
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

39:28.834 --> 39:34.606
I'VE DONE A LOT
OF BAD STUFF TOO.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.508
WITH BOYS.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.144
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
BOYS HAVE ALWAYS LIKED YOU.

39:39.177 --> 39:44.883
THEY JUST
WANTED SEX.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.852
AND I GAVE IT
TO THEM.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.587
A LOT OF THEM.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.460
EVEN ONES
I DIDN'T KNOW.

39:54.493 --> 39:57.996
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
IT MAKES ME WANT TO DIE.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.799
HONEY.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.669
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THE PAST.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.907
BUT YOU CAN
START FRESH TOMORROW.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.976
HOW?

40:11.009 --> 40:12.644
BY HUGGING
THE ONES WHO LOVE YOU,

40:12.678 --> 40:16.014
EVEN WHEN YOU THINK
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT WANT IT.

40:24.189 --> 40:27.693
IT'S TIME.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.131
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION, GRANDMA.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.967
DO YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY?

40:38.604 --> 40:40.572
I THINK YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

40:40.606 --> 40:44.242
LIKE ME.

40:44.275 --> 40:49.615
I'VE LIVED THE LIFE
I WANTED TO LIVE.

40:49.648 --> 40:52.651
AND I'VE PAID
A TERRIBLE PRICE.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.868
OKAY, NOW YOU HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.937
ANYTHING.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.840
DON'T TELL HIM
I WAS HERE.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.750
HOW DO YOU PLEAD,
MS. STABLER?
