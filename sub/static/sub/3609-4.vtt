[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.880 --> 00:06.747
- What do you want from me?
- Patience, Jack.

00:07.842 --> 00:08.831
Patience.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.463
- Danny, wait!
- Hold up.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.428
Be careful out there.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.674
See these rocks?
You're gonna chop 'em loose.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.304
You haul 'em outta here.

00:19.604 --> 00:22.846
[grunting, groaning]

00:24.275 --> 00:28.188
I am not the enemy.
We are not the enemy.

00:28.529 --> 00:32.192
But if you shoot me,
that's exactly what we'll become.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.739
[gunshoﬂ

00:45.004 --> 00:48.462
[Claire chattering indistinctly]

01:13.491 --> 01:15.402
You've got a problem with your roof.

01:17.453 --> 01:18.738
What?

01:18.829 --> 01:21.787
Maybe you should move
down the beach, just for tonight.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.741
That way I can fix it,
make some improvements.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.248
That's really nice of you to offer,
but, Aaron just fell asleep.

01:28.339 --> 01:32.127
- So I should probablyjust...
- No, it'll be worth it. I promise.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.750
Whatcha doing, brother?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.420
l was just offering
to fix this roof here.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.260
Roof?

01:40.351 --> 01:43.935
Fine. There's a problem, l'll fix it.
I'm quite handy.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.892
l was building a church before...
Eko exploded.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.609
Right.

01:52.697 --> 01:54.028
Well.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.197
Just trying to help.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.692
Thanks.

02:01.872 --> 02:05.956
- What was all that about?
- I don't know.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.876
We're gonna have to get
that guy another button to push.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.330
[classical music plays]

02:22.893 --> 02:25.555
[pounding on door]

02:39.493 --> 02:42.326
- How are you doing today, Jack?
- Great.

02:44.582 --> 02:45.913
You seem frustrated.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.751
Am I gonna keep watching cartoons,
or are you gonna tell me why I'm here?

02:51.797 --> 02:54.004
I hope you like blueberry.
If not, I can...

02:54.091 --> 02:56.002
- Should I talk to Benjamin?
- Sorry?

02:56.093 --> 02:57.629
Should I talk to Benjamin?

02:57.720 --> 03:01.588
Because I'm starting to think you're
just the person who brings me my food.

03:03.309 --> 03:07.518
You can talk to him all you want...
but he won't tell you anything.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.891
- You work for him?
- No, I don't work for him.

03:09.982 --> 03:13.019
- He's in charge.
- It doesn't work that way over here.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.522
- We make decisions together.
- Really?

03:16.447 --> 03:19.564
Because... when l was holding
that broken plate at your neck,

03:19.658 --> 03:23.242
he seemed happy to just let you die.

03:23.329 --> 03:26.321
It felt like he made that decision
on his own.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.538
You don't know
what you're talking about.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.540
I don't answer to him.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.212
Juliet, I need you.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.665
Can it wait?

03:39.678 --> 03:42.420
The sub is back.
We have a situation.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.096
So come with me now.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.653
[gate screeching]

04:07.873 --> 04:09.158
Time for work.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.832
Sounding a little stuffy there,
Chinatown.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.581
- Need to blow your nose?
- Give me an excuse.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.383
I thought I did.
What, I gotta talk about your mother?

04:22.346 --> 04:25.304
- [man] Danny, are you there?
- Yeah?

04:25.391 --> 04:27.347
- [indistinct chatter]
- Hold on.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.437
OK, go.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.886
Yeah, listen, Danny.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.097
What?

04:34.650 --> 04:37.232
- Where are they?
- They’re back in...

04:41.740 --> 04:43.446
She's hurt bad, Juliet.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.239
[Juliet] Keep her steady.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.870
[Danny] She's gonna be fine?
She'll be, OK?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.837
What happened?

05:01.427 --> 05:03.964
- We happened.
- What?

05:04.805 --> 05:08.593
Been on this rock long enough to realize
they ain't shooting each other.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.219
We did it.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.647
- Our team.
- You smiling?

05:18.068 --> 05:20.354
Damn right I'm smiling.

05:22.031 --> 05:24.363
'Cause we just got
our ticket outta here.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.169
[groaning]

05:48.599 --> 05:50.885
What are you doing?

05:55.439 --> 05:58.306
- Whenever you're ready to fill me in.
- I'm thinking.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.184
- [buzzing]
- [female voice] Warning!

06:02.279 --> 06:05.271
- [up-tempo music plays]
- Reward! Reward!

06:16.085 --> 06:18.667
That chick they brought in
on the stretcher,

06:18.754 --> 06:20.665
that's Broken Nose Man's girl.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.257
They call him "Pickett."

06:22.591 --> 06:25.378
Well, Pickett is distracted
at the moment.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.586
So?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.635
Watch and learn, little lady.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.425
Warning!

06:35.145 --> 06:36.476
Warning!

06:36.564 --> 06:39.897
There's juice pumping into this box
from somewhere.

06:39.984 --> 06:43.101
Next time someone comes
to pull me out,

06:43.195 --> 06:45.902
I wait till they
step in my little swimming hole,

06:45.990 --> 06:48.026
then I grab 'em. Zap!

06:48.117 --> 06:52.451
They fall back from the shock,
I snag the keys.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.574
Bet the bears never thought of that.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.491
- You're both gonna get electrocuted.
- I felt the jolt. I can take it.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.877
The other guy,
he ain't gonna be ready for it.

07:04.174 --> 07:07.462
- What? You think I'm crazy?
- No, I'm actually impressed.

07:09.388 --> 07:13.506
Well, wipe the stars outta your eyes,
sweetheart, 'cause we're gonna do this.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.261
- So what about Jack?
- What about him?

07:21.025 --> 07:24.438
We don't even know if he's here.
We don't even know if he's alive.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.232
We gotta take care of us.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.775
It's every man for himself, Freckles.

07:35.331 --> 07:37.071
[crowd shouting]

07:39.543 --> 07:42.580
- [whistle blows]
- All right, Ford. That's enough.

07:44.381 --> 07:48.090
[man] All tier two inmates are
required to report to your cells.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.639
Problem is l was following your hands,
not your eyes.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.634
Problem is you old and dumb.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.512
- Where did you hide it?
- I don't know!

07:57.603 --> 07:59.184
[man groaning, gasping]

07:59.688 --> 08:01.224
Who's the punching bag?

08:02.566 --> 08:05.478
- Tell me something!
- [man] Just got here, name's Munson.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.732
Rumor has it he ripped off
the government for ten mil.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.938
But they never found the money.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.617
Well, I'll be damned.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.660
If your buddy the warden didn't keep
breaking up the fights, he'd be dead.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.988
Get off of him! Hey!

08:19.083 --> 08:20.698
[man] I didn't do anything!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.918
That son of a bitch.

08:31.595 --> 08:35.087
Get little mints
on your pillow at night, too?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.013
- Sorry?
- You been here a week

08:37.101 --> 08:41.765
and you're on tote bag duty? Been here
nine months, I'm still pushing trash.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.975
Well, what does that mean?

08:45.442 --> 08:49.435
You think the warden's breaking up those
fights 'cause you're cute, Costanza?

08:50.447 --> 08:53.439
He's making a play for that ten mil.

08:54.618 --> 08:58.281
First step, butter you up.
Give you a plum job.

08:59.289 --> 09:04.283
Step Two, warden'll reach out
to your wife, use her against you.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.618
Textbook con.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.960
And you're telling me this
out of the kindness of your...

09:11.051 --> 09:12.882
Advice is free, Murgatroyd.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.550
Past nine months that warden's
made my life a living hell.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.802
He gets that ten mil you ain't got,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.884
| just might have to kill myself.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.769
Hey.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.478
Well, howdy, Warden.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.441
He bothering you, Munson?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.368
So what brings you
to the sewing shop, boss?

09:44.460 --> 09:47.577
Don't think I can't
extend your stay, Ford.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.621
All it takes is one call.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.335
One call.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.766
Now, how about you get that trash.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.532
[whispering]
Oh, yeah. The Big Kahuna.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.467
- Lunch already?
- What do you weigh?

10:37.554 --> 10:39.886
- What?
- What do you weigh?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.933
One-eighty, give or take.

10:47.231 --> 10:50.143
- How old are you?
- Thirty-two.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.269
Don't lie.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.774
Thirty-five.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.024
Good.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.160
Sayonara, sucker!

11:15.759 --> 11:19.001
- What did you do?
- We turned it off.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.587
- [yells]
- Sawyer!

11:24.768 --> 11:27.100
[screaming]

11:35.362 --> 11:36.863
Hey!

11:41.034 --> 11:43.616
[indistinct chatter]

11:43.704 --> 11:45.365
[man] Where do | start?

11:45.455 --> 11:49.243
In the two days since the sky
turned purple, we've been blind.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.076
Our comms are all down,
and I can't get 'em back up again.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.913
- And, Colleen's in critical...
- Juliet's taking care of her.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.087
[groaning] Where am I?

12:06.184 --> 12:08.095
What the hell are you doing to me?

12:08.604 --> 12:09.593
Let me out!

12:09.980 --> 12:11.186
Jason?

12:11.273 --> 12:12.729
Let me out!

12:13.233 --> 12:15.815
- Bite down on this, please.
- You bite down on it.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.985
It's for the pain.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.655
[muffled shouting]

12:27.414 --> 12:28.779
God, I hate needles.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.619
No! No! What are you doing?

12:34.087 --> 12:38.330
[Sawyer] Wait!
What are you doing? No!

12:40.344 --> 12:42.255
What are you doing?
Let me outta here!

12:42.346 --> 12:45.588
No, you have to go
through the sternum.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.092
- Like in the movie.
- I know.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.347
- No!
- One...

12:51.438 --> 12:53.554
- What are you doing?
- Two...

12:54.441 --> 12:55.521
Wait!

13:07.037 --> 13:09.904
Don't mind me.
I'm gonna take one of your clubs.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.705
Hurley said it'd be all right.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.616
Hurley, huh?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.622
Must mean you're off to save the day.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.498
So, I can take one of these?

13:20.884 --> 13:24.126
Take the five iron. I never use it.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.963
That way when you die in the jungle
doing whatever,

13:27.057 --> 13:29.048
I don't have to go looking for it.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.553
Thanks, mate.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.400
You might wanna square
your shoulders a bit more.

13:41.697 --> 13:45.565
- You play golf?
- l'm Scottish. Cheers.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.848
- [grunts] What the hell's...
- Shh.

14:19.401 --> 14:20.390
Hey!

14:23.280 --> 14:24.520
Hey, come on!

14:26.825 --> 14:28.690
Hey, move! Let's move!

14:28.785 --> 14:31.697
- Hey, come on, come on, come on!
- What are you doing?

14:31.788 --> 14:34.655
- Let's move it! Hippity Hop!
- What are you doin'?!

14:34.750 --> 14:37.537
- Let's move it, let's move it!
- What's your problem?!

14:37.627 --> 14:40.164
[Ben shouting]

14:49.681 --> 14:51.717
Did you just kill that bunny?

14:55.729 --> 14:59.688
- You know what a pacemaker is?
- What?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.525
They stick 'em in tickers
of people who have bypass work,

15:03.612 --> 15:06.820
whose hearts need just a little jump,
a... kick start.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.909
The rabbit had a pacemaker to deliver
a kick start should it get too excited.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.492
Or anxious or frightened.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.366
Or should it try to escape.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.424
Assuming that you were telling the truth
about your age and weight,

15:28.512 --> 15:32.551
your resting heart rate
should be about 70 beats per minute.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.965
Your active heart rate, however...

15:36.520 --> 15:38.727
that would be about 140.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.856
Which is the point
at which your pacemaker...

15:45.570 --> 15:47.731
...will cause your heart to explode.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.033
Which is how I know
that you're gonna start behaving now.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.954
The watch monitors your pulse.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.673
If you get within 15 beats of
your danger zone, it'll start to beep.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.095
If and when it beeps,

16:14.182 --> 16:16.218
you're gonna wanna relax yourself.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.932
Do some deep breathing, some yoga.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.768
If you want me dead, why don't you
just shoot me and get it over with?

16:28.905 --> 16:31.612
Because we're not killers, James.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.903
And one other thing.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.989
- Kate.
- You touch her, I swear...

16:40.083 --> 16:42.950
Tell her what we put in you,
that we're watching you...

16:43.044 --> 16:45.456
...you tell her any of these things...

16:45.547 --> 16:47.833
...we'll put one in her, too.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.847
[Kate] Sawyer?

17:05.650 --> 17:06.765
Are you OK?

17:16.286 --> 17:20.199
That's so you can clean yourselves up.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.123
If any of that doesn't fit,
you just give me a holler, OK?

17:33.803 --> 17:35.464
What happened?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.046
What did they do to you?

17:38.141 --> 17:41.258
Nothing. Theyjust asked me questions.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.727
- It ain't important.
- Talk to me. What happened?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.149
Look, I told you. Nothing happened.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.064
So quit asking me.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.371
Turn around.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.294
[sighs deeply]

18:37.450 --> 18:39.736
[watch beeping]

18:42.872 --> 18:45.614
- What's that?
- It's just my watch. It's busted.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.951
- When did you get a watch?
- Look, I don't tell you everything!

18:50.213 --> 18:52.124
Just leave me alone, damn it!

18:54.342 --> 18:56.378
Put some clothes on!

19:12.068 --> 19:15.936
[man] A reminder that the services
will be held in the chapel at 9:30.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.155
[indistinct chattering]

19:30.920 --> 19:32.706
[woman] Hello, Sawyer.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.339
[sighs deeply] It's James Ford.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.842
I know you know, 'cause you
got it right when you pressed charges.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.055
- You're mad at me?
- Well, look where I am.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.636
What did you want me to do?
You conned me.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.312
Something you want?

19:51.983 --> 19:55.396
Yeah. Yeah... there is.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.313
Come on.
I got license plates to make.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.171
What's this?

20:21.054 --> 20:23.045
This is your daughter.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.427
What do you want?

20:28.561 --> 20:31.303
- First I wanted you to know.
- Then what?

20:31.398 --> 20:34.606
I take one look at this picture
and turn into Father Knows Best?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.354
We're living in Albuquerque.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.731
- Near the university.
- Why are you telling me?

20:39.823 --> 20:42.735
| just thought you could
write her a letter.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.534
- Her name's Clementine.
- What the hell am I gonna write?

20:46.621 --> 20:50.113
"Goo goo, gaa gaa?"
She's a baby. She ain't mine!

20:50.583 --> 20:52.119
Sawyer, she is...

20:52.877 --> 20:54.868
I ain't got no daughter!

21:13.690 --> 21:16.853
I've been checking out my cage,
and I think...

21:17.777 --> 21:20.519
...if I climb to the top
I can squeeze through the bars.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.400
They're spaced farther apart up there.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.573
Don't bother.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.868
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about being smart.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.489
Think we should chill out awhile,
get the lay of the land.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.963
[man] Everything's under control.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.381
[man 2] Yeah?
You know what he's doing to Karl?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.300
[man 1] He knows what he's doing.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.878
[man 2] It was a mistake
bringing those two here.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.213
[door opening]

21:50.143 --> 21:51.929
- What did you do to Sawyer?
- Nothing.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.978
I heard him yelling.
You've got blood on your clothes.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.645
It's not his blood!

21:59.402 --> 22:01.233
Then whose blood is it?

22:01.321 --> 22:03.733
It's the blood of a woman who's dying.

22:07.911 --> 22:10.948
Jack, I need your help.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.580
[alarm blaring]

22:25.094 --> 22:26.345
It's Jack!

22:28.765 --> 22:31.177
- Jack!
- [Sawyer] Doc!

22:31.267 --> 22:32.427
Doc!

22:32.519 --> 22:34.100
Jack!

22:38.942 --> 22:40.273
Jack!

22:44.489 --> 22:46.775
Have you lost your mind?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.198
- Bring him here?
- He's a doctor. He can help.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.697
- This is not why...
- Do you want her to die?

22:51.788 --> 22:53.153
Come on.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.210
- What happened?
- Gunshot wound. To the abdomen.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.801
Those aren't hers. Come on.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.926
[monitor beeping]

23:16.479 --> 23:18.640
- What's he doing here?
- He's here to help.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.347
- Tell him who did it. He oughta know!
- I need him out.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.852
Get out. Go.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.151
- [man] They got it.
- No way! She's my wife!

23:26.823 --> 23:30.031
I got the bullet out,
but she's still bleeding.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.243
Right upper quadrant.
It's flowing badly.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.490
No, l padded it.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.073
Clamp under the liver
so I can look back there.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.419
I'm not a surgeon.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.173
I know. But I need you to do this.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.673
Here.

23:52.890 --> 23:56.474
Retrohepatic caval bleeding, behind
the liver, that's why you missed it.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.348
I need lap pads,
as many as you've got.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.728
[flatlining]

24:11.534 --> 24:14.947
A crash cart. Now!
Juliet, I need paddles.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.528
It's broken.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.742
We haven't had...
we haven't had anything happen before.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.918
We didn't... We ha...
I don't...

24:57.205 --> 25:00.538
[Jack panting]

25:05.254 --> 25:06.664
Time of death at...

25:10.093 --> 25:11.583
She's gone.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.344
They did this! They did this!

25:19.435 --> 25:22.973
Danny, wait. Danny, wait, wait. No.

25:39.664 --> 25:41.200
Hey, hey, hey!

25:41.290 --> 25:44.123
Take it easy, hoss!
Take it easy!

25:44.794 --> 25:47.035
[grunts] Take it easy!

25:47.130 --> 25:48.245
Shut up!

25:48.715 --> 25:50.706
[watch beeping]

25:50.800 --> 25:52.882
You love this guy?

25:52.969 --> 25:54.550
What?

25:54.637 --> 25:57.094
- I said do you love him?
- Stop!

25:58.808 --> 26:00.594
Do you love him?

26:01.769 --> 26:03.634
- Do you love him?
- Leave him alone!

26:05.398 --> 26:08.014
- Do you love him?
- What are you doing? Stop!

26:08.109 --> 26:10.395
Do...you...

26:10.486 --> 26:14.399
- ...love...him?
- Yes, I love him!

26:14.490 --> 26:18.449
I love him! Please!

26:20.621 --> 26:24.864
[Kate crying]

26:32.008 --> 26:33.919
[Danny] Lock him up!

26:42.018 --> 26:42.131
[PA chattering indistinct/y]

26:42.143 --> 26:44.885
[PA chattering indistinct/y]

26:45.605 --> 26:48.096
- I need to talk to you.
- Sorry, I'm busy.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.556
It's important.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.687
Please.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.776
You were right. I loved her.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.949
And I really thought she...

27:00.036 --> 27:02.493
Ten mil's a lotta greenbacks, killer.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.195
Tends to change things.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.116
That's why you never get attached.

27:08.211 --> 27:11.703
'Cause once you care,
that's when they can come at you.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.665
Well, what did yours want?

27:16.052 --> 27:19.636
I saw you the other day with a woman.
What did she want?

27:21.182 --> 27:23.468
Something I ain't got.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.809
That all?
You had yourself a good cry?

27:26.896 --> 27:29.308
Mind if I go back
and see if George gets his farm?

27:31.984 --> 27:34.646
I need you to move it.
The money.

27:35.446 --> 27:36.902
The money you didn't steal?

27:38.241 --> 27:40.152
We both know I did.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.655
Lila's hired a PI.
She's gonna find it.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.701
Do this for me. You have to.

27:46.874 --> 27:50.833
No. It's too dangerous.
I'll be a walking target.

27:51.337 --> 27:55.046
If you don't help me,
the warden'll get it all. He'll win.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.166
Please. Please.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.767
Are you OK?

28:09.981 --> 28:11.846
Dandy.

28:11.941 --> 28:15.274
Guy hits like a girl.
No offense.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.024
Why did he do that?

28:19.115 --> 28:20.855
[Sawyer] Hell if I know.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.407
These people ever make
any sense to you?

28:25.955 --> 28:27.491
What are you doing?

28:27.915 --> 28:30.406
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

28:35.423 --> 28:37.209
Hang on a second, Freckles.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.425
- [gaSping]
- I told you, the time ain't right.

28:46.309 --> 28:48.721
You're the one who said we had to go.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.097
- Well, that was before...
- Before what?

28:52.815 --> 28:56.728
I don't know what they did to you, but
you're scared enough to lie about it.

28:56.819 --> 29:00.528
And that scares me more than anything
they may have done to us before.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.856
Wait!

29:03.492 --> 29:05.528
Wait!

29:14.921 --> 29:16.752
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.296
- Don't!
- I'm not leaving you, Sawyer.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.090
- I can get it open.
- You're already out. You gotta go.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.753
- You gotta leave me!
- What?

29:24.847 --> 29:26.053
Run!

29:27.016 --> 29:29.302
- What did they do to you?
- Will you go!

29:29.393 --> 29:31.133
[watch beeping]

29:31.228 --> 29:34.641
- What is that thing?
- You run.

29:34.732 --> 29:38.600
- Just go. It's every man for himself.
- Why didn't you fight back?

29:40.196 --> 29:43.359
Tell me the truth,
for once in your life!

29:44.825 --> 29:46.952
If you really love me...

29:47.954 --> 29:49.569
...go.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.874
| only said that
so he'd stop hitting you.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.716
Run. Hurry!

30:09.892 --> 30:12.133
What the hell are you doing?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.603
Kate!

30:15.982 --> 30:18.849
Damn it, Freckles, don't.
Every man for himself!

30:39.171 --> 30:41.548
Live together, die alone.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.729
You know Danny wants to kill him.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.857
Danny can wait.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.833
No.

31:21.005 --> 31:24.293
I want him to sit with her
for a while longer.

31:39.065 --> 31:43.399
I'm sorry they
had to put handcuffs on you.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.991
I'm a fertility doctor.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.537
I'm not used to death.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.167
- What was her name?
- Cole.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.670
Short for Colleen.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.921
I shouldn't have...
I should've come to get you sooner.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.927
It wouldn't have mattered.

32:16.018 --> 32:19.431
There wasn't any more
that you could've done.

32:19.522 --> 32:22.013
She was dead
before you put her on the table.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.152
Are you saying that
to make me feel better?

32:37.623 --> 32:40.239
I don't care about
making you feel better.

32:46.841 --> 32:49.002
I'm gonna take you back now.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.669
I'm sorry for bringing you here.

32:55.850 --> 32:58.717
Whose x-rays are those? Outside?

32:59.770 --> 33:04.309
Those are spinal x-rays, and they belong
to a man about 40 years old.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.564
And whoever he is, he has a very large
tumor on his L-four vertebrae.

33:09.697 --> 33:12.985
And ljust happen to be
a spinal surgeon.

33:13.075 --> 33:15.862
So, you tell me, Juliet.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.160
Who am I here to save?

33:58.954 --> 34:00.490
[Hurley] Is that...

34:02.249 --> 34:03.705
...art?

34:04.418 --> 34:06.955
No. Just an experiment.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.372
OK.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.710
- You want some fruit salad?
- Thanks. I'm not hungry.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.089
You might want to wait a minute.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.133
Why's that?

34:22.228 --> 34:24.310
[thundering, raining]

34:28.275 --> 34:30.937
[Aaron crying]

34:40.162 --> 34:42.448
[Claire screams]

35:01.684 --> 35:05.518
[Ben] Psst. Psst.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.314
Good morning.

35:13.696 --> 35:15.311
Let's go for a walk.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.710
[door buzzing]

35:43.934 --> 35:45.845
l have to be honest, Ford.

35:47.521 --> 35:51.605
They first brought you here, I thought
you were nothing more than a dumb hick.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.228
Now I know better.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.065
You're a dumb hick
that knows how to steal.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.989
Can we just get this over with?

36:02.995 --> 36:04.735
Yeah, let's.

36:05.956 --> 36:09.244
You remember Agent Freedman
from the Treasury Department?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.702
So, what do you got?

36:19.428 --> 36:25.298
The ten million's in a red Bronco in
a Store-lt-Quick facility in Sawgrass.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.299
Right off 441.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.057
Unit 23-C.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.724
That's where your money is.

36:36.987 --> 36:39.194
As agreed,

36:39.281 --> 36:42.990
the last six years of your sentence
have been commuted.

36:43.786 --> 36:46.778
Soon as the truck is recovered,
and the funds confirmed,

36:46.872 --> 36:49.033
your commission will be processed.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.577
Now, how would you like that?

36:52.252 --> 36:54.743
Set up a new account.
Don't matter what bank.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.669
Just make it in Albuquerque.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.247
OK.

37:00.511 --> 37:03.469
Put it in the name
of Clementine Phillips.

37:04.181 --> 37:06.763
OK. Clementine Phillips.

37:08.477 --> 37:12.720
And I want it so there's no way she
can ever find out who the money's from.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.889
Who's Clementine Phillips?

37:17.820 --> 37:19.276
We done?

37:21.198 --> 37:23.814
Congratulations, Ford.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.651
You just lied and cheated
your way outta prison.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.495
You're a free man.

37:50.686 --> 37:52.267
Not much further, James.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.515
Just to the top of the next rise.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.688
What's up there?

38:00.779 --> 38:02.610
Something I want you to see.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.112
"Is it that little place
you always wanted, George?"

38:08.203 --> 38:09.488
Sorry?

38:10.873 --> 38:12.488
What, don't you read?

38:13.292 --> 38:15.157
It's from Of Mice and Men.

38:16.378 --> 38:19.370
You'd like it. Puppies get killed.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.255
[watch beeping]

38:46.241 --> 38:49.074
Bring me up here to kill me?

38:49.161 --> 38:51.994
Make that thing you put inside me...

38:52.080 --> 38:54.162
...blow up my damn heart?

38:57.419 --> 38:59.626
Your heart's not gonna blow up, James.

39:01.757 --> 39:04.373
The only thing
we put inside you was doubt.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.550
The watch is
a heart rate monitor, but...

39:10.974 --> 39:12.510
...nothing more.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.135
Look.

39:21.276 --> 39:24.234
We gave him a sedative,
not a pacemaker.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.113
How do I know that's the same bunny?

39:28.200 --> 39:31.158
That you didn't just
paint an eight on another one?

39:32.329 --> 39:33.614
You don't.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.879
You son of a bitch.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.634
The rabbit wasn't the thing
I wanted to show you.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.362
What the. . .?

40:22.379 --> 40:23.960
You ever been to Alcatraz?

40:24.339 --> 40:26.045
Take the tour?

40:27.342 --> 40:31.255
You're standing on a small island
roughly twice the size of Alcatraz.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.424
And that over there?

40:37.519 --> 40:39.134
That's your island.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.099
The one you've come to know and love.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.271
| just wanted you to know...

40:47.821 --> 40:49.482
...there's nowhere to run.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.071
You did all this just to...

40:57.372 --> 40:59.454
...just to keep me in a damn cage?

40:59.541 --> 41:03.534
We did all this because the only way to
gain a con man's respect is to con him.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.042
You're pretty good, Sawyer.

41:10.844 --> 41:12.675
We're a lot better.

41:18.060 --> 41:21.143
Funny thing is, the pacemaker
wasn't what kept you in line.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.844
It was when l threatened her.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.983
You work so hard to make her think
you don't care,

41:28.070 --> 41:30.812
that you don't need her, but...

41:33.200 --> 41:36.237
"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.

41:37.871 --> 41:40.863
It don't make no difference
who the guy is...

41:40.957 --> 41:43.243
...long as he's with you.

41:44.211 --> 41:46.543
| tell you...

41:46.630 --> 41:49.793
| tell you a guy gets
too lonely and he gets sick."

41:51.385 --> 41:54.343
- What are you talking about?
- It's from Of Mice and Men.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.003
Don't you read?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.896
Come on.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.018
Let's get you back to your cage.
