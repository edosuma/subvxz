00:02.135 --> 00:05.171
In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.171 --> 00:08.080
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.080 --> 00:09.609
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.407
These are their stories.

00:16.769 --> 00:18.304
I need to speak to him.

00:18.304 --> 00:20.544
- He's got a busted arm...
- Sorry, Officer.

00:20.544 --> 00:24.212
- We don't know him.
- Let's go.! Ball up.!

00:27.550 --> 00:31.224
Maybe you can take a closer look.

00:31.224 --> 00:36.906
He's a schoolkid.
That's all I know.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.338
Sorry, man. Don't know him.

00:38.338 --> 00:42.241
Guys.! You got midterms next week.
Get on home.

00:42.241 --> 00:45.064
- Okay, Coach.
- Get outta here.

00:46.406 --> 00:47.622
You a recruiter?

00:47.622 --> 00:50.663
L-I'm lookin' for this young man.

00:50.663 --> 00:53.623
Recruiters know they can't work
on school grounds.

00:53.623 --> 00:55.942
You need to leave.

00:55.942 --> 00:57.504
No. They moved out, I think.

00:57.504 --> 00:58.930
You have any idea where?

00:58.930 --> 01:00.035
Maybe they have family in the neighborhood.

01:00.035 --> 01:04.634
Oh, they got family, all right.

01:04.634 --> 01:06.575
It's all good, Elvin.

01:06.575 --> 01:10.036
You get a taste too.
You know, a finder's fee.

01:10.036 --> 01:13.420
With or without you,
I'll find him.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.569
Somebody at a school or Rucker Park.

01:15.569 --> 01:18.483
- They'll tell me.
- You don't wanna do that.

01:18.483 --> 01:21.829
You wanna be standing away from him.

01:25.403 --> 01:28.041
If this doesn't get nailed down,
I could lose my job.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.091
Don't worry.
I'm gonna find him.

01:30.091 --> 01:35.703
Maybe you don't understand, Diego.
I'm in a bad situation.

01:43.352 --> 01:47.963
Oh! I get a free throw for that.

01:47.963 --> 01:52.063
- Yo, Mr. Electrician.
- Aw, come on.

3x11 Mad Hops

02:41.102 --> 02:43.679
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/01/11

02:47.324 --> 02:49.949
Bullet cut through the flex conduit,
shorted the lights.

02:49.949 --> 02:51.998
- No one heard the shot?
- Nope.

02:51.998 --> 02:54.827
He had no I.D., no cell phone,
no watch.

02:54.827 --> 02:57.374
Punks used the whole buffalo.

02:59.906 --> 03:02.234
Well, there's no burn marks on his hands.

03:02.234 --> 03:04.704
No track marks. Doesn't look like a user.

03:04.704 --> 03:08.409
If he was selling, there'd be
a backup somewhere nearby.

03:08.409 --> 03:12.375
He didn't come back here for the view.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.558
He was havin' a smoke.

03:15.558 --> 03:17.078
He was shot while putting his cigarette out.

03:17.078 --> 03:20.773
The butt's still stuck
to the bottom of his boot.

03:20.773 --> 03:23.713
The punks left the buffalo's knife.

03:23.713 --> 03:25.113
We got a match on his prints.

03:25.113 --> 03:28.413
He's a P.I. Out of Bensonhurst...
Diego Bracho.

03:28.413 --> 03:30.081
If Bracho was worried about his safety,

03:30.081 --> 03:32.406
he would have kept the knife closer at hand.

03:32.406 --> 03:35.672
But instead, he felt safe enough
to take his eyes off the shooter...

03:35.672 --> 03:40.102
long enough to put his cigarette out.

03:42.549 --> 03:45.351
Well, he might have been meeting a client.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.901
Office of Diego Bracho, P.I. Brooklyn
New York, Wednesday, january 8

03:47.901 --> 03:52.597
He taught Social Sciences
at I.S. 44, 15 years ago.

03:52.597 --> 03:56.295
In the Bronx. Should have been
enough excitement for two lifetimes.

03:56.295 --> 04:00.750
Here we go.
Uh, receipts for Harlem.

04:00.750 --> 04:05.470
Looks like he's getting paid in gum...
Power Chew sports gum.

04:05.470 --> 04:08.927
These receipts are from two days ago.

04:08.927 --> 04:12.953
Mm. City parking lot.

04:12.953 --> 04:17.529
A gas station in Queens and two
from the diner down the street here.

04:17.529 --> 04:22.327
One for breakfast, one for lunch,
with the gas receipt in between.

04:22.327 --> 04:25.086
He had breakfast,
went up to Queens, came back.

04:25.086 --> 04:27.725
Wrote down the mileage.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.568
Twenty-five miles.

04:33.818 --> 04:36.398
Okay, So...

04:36.398 --> 04:41.401
Uh, office is, uh, here.

04:41.401 --> 04:46.305
Uh, gas station is on
the 2100 block of Hazen Street.

04:46.305 --> 04:49.379
Uh, 11 miles one way,
22 miles round-trip.

04:49.379 --> 04:51.160
Still three miles short.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.876
Uh, that's one and a half mile...

04:54.876 --> 05:00.246
one way...
to someplace with a city parking lot.

05:01.498 --> 05:04.542
Rikers Island?

05:04.542 --> 05:06.181
It was mistaken identity.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.399
That P.I. Had the wrong black man.

05:08.399 --> 05:12.260
"Elvin Fergin"?
That's not a common name.

05:12.260 --> 05:15.655
- How'd he make a mistake?
- I didn't get all up in his head.

05:15.655 --> 05:17.684
You do a life-skills workshop.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.890
Mm, you're studying for your G.E.D.

05:20.890 --> 05:24.823
A man can turn a page,
be a better example.

05:24.823 --> 05:27.295
I believe that.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.577
What did Bracho want?

05:33.256 --> 05:35.369
We'll pick up every
dope dealer in that park till

05:35.369 --> 05:38.047
we find the one who says you
put him up to killing Bracho.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.627
Lady, that park's 15 streets
from where my crew works.

05:41.627 --> 05:47.522
It's sacred ground.
Nobody does business in that park.

05:47.522 --> 05:49.754
Guard.

05:49.754 --> 05:54.557
Uh, what park are you talking about, Elvin?

05:54.557 --> 05:58.664
Elvin's crew works out of
the Carter projects up on 172nd.

05:58.664 --> 06:02.485
That's 40 blocks from where Bracho was killed.

06:02.485 --> 06:05.438
Elvin assumed we meant another park.

06:05.438 --> 06:09.284
Maybe one Bracho mentioned.

06:09.284 --> 06:13.820
Fifteen blocks from the Carter projects.

06:13.820 --> 06:17.561
156th and-and Eighth.

06:17.561 --> 06:21.459
Well, Elvin's right.
That is sacred ground.

06:21.459 --> 06:24.183
Rucker Park Wes 156th & 8th Avenue
Monday, january 13

06:24.183 --> 06:25.574
Hey, y'all. Hold up. Listen,

06:25.574 --> 06:27.251
I don't know anything
about this man right here.

06:27.251 --> 06:29.664
All we do is play ball here
in the Rucker, Officer.

06:29.664 --> 06:35.929
Uh, my partner says he has
stories about this place.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.342
Marv, come here.
Check out her dibs.

06:38.342 --> 06:40.845
What do you got on,
P. Diddy drapes?

06:40.845 --> 06:43.702
What you all, fashion police?

06:45.341 --> 06:48.246
Obviously, they don't know
we're the hoops police,

06:48.246 --> 06:49.959
'cause we ought to lock
you up for wearin' those kicks.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.027
Where'd you find those,
on a telephone line?

06:52.027 --> 06:53.635
Whoo!

06:55.031 --> 07:01.194
Hey, uh, my-my partner told me he saw
someone named Earl the Goat play.

07:01.194 --> 07:04.273
Earl the Goat?
You saw that guy play?

07:04.273 --> 07:08.672
This one Saturday, when I was a kid,
I saw the Goat.

07:08.672 --> 07:10.964
He dunked it, caught it,

07:10.964 --> 07:12.968
and he dunked it again before he landed.

07:12.968 --> 07:15.570
I ain't seen him. You?

07:16.991 --> 07:19.989
What's that, Power Chew?

07:19.989 --> 07:22.379
- Is this stuff any good?
- Aw, man, that stuff is awful, dog.

07:22.379 --> 07:25.565
That fool just chew it 'cause it's free.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.056
So, why is it free?

07:33.056 --> 07:37.020
They had a giveaway a few weeks ago
when the pros played here.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.632
Neo-Culture Advertising Agency 370 West
118th Street, Tuesday, January 14

07:39.632 --> 07:42.419
We had pros show up unannounced.
The kids went crazy.

07:42.419 --> 07:44.012
We caught it all on hidden cameras.

07:44.012 --> 07:47.018
And this was all for
a Power Chew commercial?

07:47.018 --> 07:48.668
Can we see the footage?

07:48.668 --> 07:52.214
We need to see if this man
was there that day.

07:53.363 --> 07:55.754
He's not on anything we shot.

07:55.754 --> 07:58.379
We'd like to see it for ourselves.

07:58.379 --> 08:00.242
I'm sorry. It belongs to the client.

08:00.242 --> 08:01.773
They paid for it.

08:01.773 --> 08:06.982
But you're not saying that you,
uh, don't know him, are you?

08:08.010 --> 08:12.742
It's just, um...
That award, can I?

08:14.707 --> 08:23.791
Yeah. "Best Documentary,
Brooklyn Film Festival,1994, Repo 101."

08:23.791 --> 08:27.403
That would be about a teacher.

08:27.403 --> 08:30.074
Maybe one who became a repo man.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.385
Yes.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.981
Maybe Diego Bracho.

08:32.981 --> 08:36.066
The late Diego Bracho.

08:38.558 --> 08:41.780
He was working for you?

08:41.780 --> 08:44.743
Look, the Power Chew people
fell in love with this one kid on...

08:44.743 --> 08:46.087
on his cell phone.

08:46.087 --> 08:50.282
He was perfect. They wanted him
for the national campaign.

08:50.282 --> 08:53.583
I thought I had all the signed releases.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.915
Except for this kid,
so you hired Bracho to find him.

08:55.915 --> 08:59.670
We didn't know his name.
There was nothing to go on.

09:03.508 --> 09:05.001
Is that him with the bum wing?

09:05.001 --> 09:09.429
No, there's nothing wrong with
his... his right arm.

09:09.429 --> 09:11.612
Look.

09:16.992 --> 09:19.022
It's an old basketball exercise.

09:19.022 --> 09:20.862
Put your dominant arm in a sling...

09:20.862 --> 09:23.574
builds the dexterity in your off hand.

09:23.574 --> 09:26.659
This kid's in a basketball program.

09:26.659 --> 09:30.656
You know, Elvin said something
about turning the page,

09:30.656 --> 09:34.187
setting a better example.

09:35.353 --> 09:40.340
Elvin's visitors, the last six months...
his lawyer, his parents...

09:40.340 --> 09:43.995
and his brother, Corey, 18.

09:43.995 --> 09:48.031
Look him up. See what kind of
example Elvin's talking about.

09:48.031 --> 09:51.192
You played ball in school?

09:51.192 --> 09:54.333
J.V. Power forward.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.834
Gave it up.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.313
You find this kid?

09:58.313 --> 10:00.275
Well, yes and no.

10:00.275 --> 10:05.152
His parents reported him
missing two weeks ago.

10:07.728 --> 10:11.339
Corey had a game at his school
that Friday night.

10:11.339 --> 10:15.153
He didn't come home after...
or on Saturday.

10:15.153 --> 10:18.554
And his bike's gone.

10:18.554 --> 10:20.309
Game on Friday... how'd he play?

10:20.309 --> 10:23.076
He didn't play all but two minutes,
but he was fine.

10:23.076 --> 10:24.289
He's a good player.

10:24.289 --> 10:26.549
How was his mood?
Any problems?

10:26.549 --> 10:29.438
Except for wantin' more playin' time,
his attitude was great.

10:29.438 --> 10:31.790
He never talked about runnin'away
or hurtin'himself.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.120
I told the police all this two weeks ago.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.487
And what you didn't tell them
is Corey has an older brother at Rikers.

10:37.487 --> 10:39.908
Corey has a shot at the pros,

10:39.908 --> 10:45.038
and nobody, including Elvin,
wants to mess it up for him.

10:46.453 --> 10:50.984
That's Corey's away bag...
when his team plays outside the city.

10:55.311 --> 10:58.149
That's a birthday gift.

10:58.149 --> 11:00.325
Anyone contact you about Corey?

11:00.325 --> 11:02.145
Maybe a private investigator.

11:02.145 --> 11:04.472
No. No one.

11:04.472 --> 11:07.026
These are about size 48.

11:07.026 --> 11:09.488
These would be your pants,
Mr. Fergin.

11:09.488 --> 11:12.264
My wife and I had problems.

11:12.264 --> 11:15.470
I moved into a place up in Harlem
to be near Corey's school...

11:15.470 --> 11:18.268
so he could be with me during the week.

11:18.268 --> 11:21.780
I moved back here when he went missing.

11:22.905 --> 11:25.133
Mrs. Fergin?

11:25.133 --> 11:28.500
We're fine now.

11:31.089 --> 11:33.721
Apartment of Demario & Corey Fergin 170 West
140th Street, Thursday, January 16

11:33.721 --> 11:37.149
Mr. Fergin moved in with his son in August.

11:37.149 --> 11:39.938
No loud noises.
No complaints.

11:39.938 --> 11:42.495
The-The furniture,
it comes with this apartment?

11:42.495 --> 11:43.169
Yes.

11:43.169 --> 11:47.159
The big TV, the video game and
the sound system... it's all standard?

11:47.159 --> 11:50.123
- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

11:50.123 --> 11:52.312
A place like this,
how much does it run?

11:52.312 --> 11:54.602
Three grand.
More than I can afford.

11:54.602 --> 11:57.867
More than you'd think
Corey's dad could afford.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.080
Excuse me.

12:02.271 --> 12:04.403
Before Corey's parents split up,

12:04.403 --> 12:09.766
Corey went to high school back
in Brooklyn where his parents live.

12:09.766 --> 12:12.768
But his father made it sound like...

12:12.768 --> 12:17.582
that he moved here to Harlem because
Corey was already going to high school here.

12:17.582 --> 12:21.092
So Corey changed schools
after his father moved.

12:21.092 --> 12:22.793
It matters?

12:22.793 --> 12:26.403
Well, it does if Mr. Fergin lied about it.

12:26.403 --> 12:31.033
Corey dunks, shoots from the outside,
plays defense.

12:31.033 --> 12:35.174
He's as gifted a point guard
as I've coached in 30 years.

12:35.174 --> 12:40.829
The whole team is good, especially
these two getting all those three-pointers.

12:40.829 --> 12:45.602
Jace Gleesing and Kyle Davis.

12:45.602 --> 12:47.667
You played?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.121
Yeah. High school.

12:49.121 --> 12:51.861
In the city?
Maybe I saw you play.

12:51.861 --> 12:55.711
No. I didn't stick with it.

12:55.711 --> 12:58.184
Ah, maybe with the right encouragement.

12:58.184 --> 13:00.211
Mr. Rutherford,
you're the assistant coach.

13:00.211 --> 13:03.941
You're close to the players.
What do you hear?

13:03.941 --> 13:05.943
That he might have been selling dope.

13:05.943 --> 13:08.213
You know he's got a brother
in prison for dealin'?

13:08.213 --> 13:10.071
Yes, we know.

13:10.071 --> 13:13.221
All the same, we're gonna
need to talk to the players.

13:13.221 --> 13:16.164
We'll need their names.

13:16.885 --> 13:22.115
I didn't actually see him sellin' weed,
but everybody knows he was doin' it.

13:22.115 --> 13:25.041
Well, then it must be true.

13:26.618 --> 13:29.813
You know what?
We're gonna need your addresses.

13:29.813 --> 13:33.771
Here. Just...'Cause we might
need to talk to you later.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.364
That's Corey's building.

13:40.364 --> 13:41.862
You live there with your parents?

13:41.862 --> 13:43.210
Uh, with my dad.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.751
- Your dad?
- Yeah. My parents,

13:44.751 --> 13:46.947
they weren't getting along,
so, uh, he moved in there.

13:46.947 --> 13:49.663
What about you, Kyle?
Is that why you live there?

13:49.663 --> 13:53.002
Well, yeah. Yeah.
My pops needed his own space.

13:53.002 --> 13:55.227
- Geez! Sorry.
- Oh.!

13:55.227 --> 13:58.067
Sorry. It's nice.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.375
It's just like Corey's.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.369
You pay for that out of your paper route?

14:02.369 --> 14:05.921
Uh, no. My parents gave it
to me when they split up.

14:05.921 --> 14:08.102
Oh, what about this...
this fancy watch?

14:08.102 --> 14:10.287
Where'd that come from?

14:10.287 --> 14:15.261
No, I see. You guys...
Your parents split up
and you get this stuff, right?

14:16.650 --> 14:18.169
End up at the same school,

14:18.169 --> 14:20.938
playing on the same team,
livin' under the same roof.

14:20.938 --> 14:24.936
We gotta get home,
'cause we got a midterm tomorrow.

14:29.158 --> 14:33.729
You ever read the public
school's rules on athletics?

14:33.729 --> 14:35.652
No. It's what I said.

14:35.652 --> 14:38.560
Me and my wife were
having marital difficulties.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.645
That's why I moved out.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.585
No. Corey needed to be on
a championship team.

14:42.585 --> 14:47.038
But a student can't change
schools on the basis of athletics.

14:47.038 --> 14:49.978
That's what the New York Public School...

14:49.978 --> 14:53.264
Athletic League Rules and Regulations says.

14:53.264 --> 14:56.160
That's not what happened here.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.733
Mr. Fergin, five exceptional players,

14:59.733 --> 15:04.617
including Corey, were transferred to
Moses Caro High this year...

15:04.617 --> 15:07.536
because their parents split up.

15:07.536 --> 15:11.593
They all got the same fancy apartments,

15:11.593 --> 15:13.416
- same gifts.
- No. I paid...

15:13.416 --> 15:17.154
Can you show us the canceled rent checks?

15:18.611 --> 15:23.889
Someone's paying a lot of money
to build this team.

15:23.889 --> 15:24.835
Who is it?

15:24.835 --> 15:28.856
But it doesn't have anything
to do with what happened to Corey.

15:28.856 --> 15:34.685
Mr. Fergin, they're sayin'
that Corey was sellin' drugs.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.933
That's why he's missing.

15:36.933 --> 15:40.564
Only you can set the record straight.

15:41.283 --> 15:45.648
Come on. You're his father.

15:47.124 --> 15:50.636
His name's Curtis Romney.

15:50.636 --> 15:54.489
He came to me about Corey transferring schools.

15:54.489 --> 15:57.368
My son Elvin told me to be careful...

15:57.368 --> 16:00.878
because Romney was involved in sports betting.

16:03.452 --> 16:08.933
I just wanted to give Corey a better opportunity.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.132
Coach says you're startin'tonight.

16:13.132 --> 16:14.879
So listen up. Here's the rules.

16:14.879 --> 16:18.302
You get the rock,
you dish to Kyle and me.

16:18.302 --> 16:20.020
We clear?

16:20.020 --> 16:22.819
Hey! He asked you a question!

16:24.192 --> 16:26.338
Hey! What's the problem here?

16:26.338 --> 16:29.384
Ben. Come on.

16:34.971 --> 16:38.388
All right, get out there,
all of ya.

16:44.361 --> 16:48.781
This is what you've done...
to my team.

16:52.918 --> 16:55.149
It's called grass roots boosterism...

16:55.149 --> 16:57.741
giving the community a team
they can be proud of.

16:57.741 --> 17:00.620
Well, l-I call it "long-term investment."

17:00.620 --> 17:02.908
You recruit the players,

17:02.908 --> 17:06.969
you, uh, touch their young
lives with your generosity,

17:06.969 --> 17:08.525
and then you leave a stain

17:08.525 --> 17:11.484
that they carry through their
college or their professional career...

17:11.484 --> 17:15.873
a taint that you can threaten them with...

17:15.873 --> 17:19.423
anytime you need to shave some points.

17:19.423 --> 17:24.136
And this one... he wanted
more playing time, more money.

17:24.136 --> 17:27.726
Whatever it was, he was more
trouble than he was worth.

17:27.726 --> 17:30.219
My client denies any involvement.

17:30.219 --> 17:33.790
This conversation is over.

17:37.626 --> 17:39.891
Harbor Patrol just pulled
a body out of the Harlem River.

17:39.891 --> 17:41.510
Male black, 16-20.

17:41.510 --> 17:42.820
Any I.D.?

17:42.820 --> 17:46.739
He's 6'5"...
I'll take a flyer it's our missing kid.

17:46.739 --> 17:52.035
Now maybe we can add "known killer"
to Romney's credentials.

17:54.265 --> 17:57.097
The wound's premortem.
Trachea's collapsed.

17:57.097 --> 18:00.698
And these three marks and the bruise...
they look like they could be from knuckles.

18:00.698 --> 18:03.429
Could be.
And then...

18:03.429 --> 18:05.313
I'll help.

18:05.313 --> 18:06.950
We have these.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.845
Looks like it's from a club
or a pipe... metal or wood.

18:09.845 --> 18:11.967
This looks like it's from a hex nut.

18:11.967 --> 18:17.573
His watch stopped at 11:16
the night of his Friday game.

18:36.334 --> 18:39.185
Uh... Let me do that.

18:54.298 --> 18:57.562
Oh, this is, uh,

18:57.562 --> 19:01.104
red brick dust.

19:01.104 --> 19:04.211
The water in his lungs...
we need a chemical analysis.

19:04.211 --> 19:07.921
Anything you want.

19:07.921 --> 19:12.161
He was punched in the windpipe
and thrown into the water alive.

19:12.161 --> 19:16.364
If it was a pro, he would have
made sure he was dead.

19:16.364 --> 19:20.720
This was more out of control.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.168
What a damn waste.

19:24.168 --> 19:25.989
So, it was true, the rumors.

19:25.989 --> 19:28.558
We don't think it has
anything to do with drugs.

19:28.558 --> 19:32.109
I see that you-you've won six, uh...

19:32.109 --> 19:36.966
No. Seven championships...
and teaching awards.

19:36.966 --> 19:38.782
I teach Social Sciences.

19:38.782 --> 19:41.705
Front office says that you're
gonna retire at the end of the year.

19:43.362 --> 19:45.884
Be nice to go out with a...
bang.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.544
I play to win every year,

19:47.544 --> 19:51.011
or else there's no point in suiting up.

19:51.011 --> 19:52.390
Does he always beat around the bush?

19:52.390 --> 19:54.266
I can be direct.

19:54.266 --> 19:56.516
You're divorced.

19:56.516 --> 19:59.328
You got no kids.

19:59.328 --> 20:04.128
And basketball is pretty much it for you, Coach.

20:04.128 --> 20:07.469
You haven't won a championship
in the last seven years.

20:07.469 --> 20:10.304
You might be hungry for
a big win to cap your career.

20:10.304 --> 20:13.671
Hungry enough to get into
business with Curtis Romney?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.770
I can be direct too.

20:17.638 --> 20:20.694
I see a problem with authority figures.

20:20.694 --> 20:22.676
You defy them.

20:22.676 --> 20:24.934
You disrespect them.

20:24.934 --> 20:29.981
But the truth is,
you're intimidated by them.

20:31.232 --> 20:36.288
It's the mark of a boy
with an indifferent father.

20:36.288 --> 20:41.565
His absence took the joy
out of playing basketball.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.596
By the time I was aware of what
Romney had done, it was too late.

20:51.596 --> 20:54.541
If I'd blown the whistle, the whole team
would have been suspended.

20:54.541 --> 20:57.906
You can't convince me Romney
did this without your help.

20:57.906 --> 21:02.245
No. I believe him.

21:02.245 --> 21:08.402
You... didn't use Romney's five ringers...

21:08.402 --> 21:11.787
for all your starting lineups.

21:12.385 --> 21:15.347
You mixed in lesser players.

21:15.347 --> 21:19.222
To make them into better players.

21:19.222 --> 21:20.372
Yeah.

21:20.372 --> 21:23.129
I don't have anything to prove on the court.

21:23.129 --> 21:25.925
Not anymore.

21:25.925 --> 21:28.604
Right.

21:28.604 --> 21:32.254
That torch had been passed.

21:35.312 --> 21:37.999
This whole thing was Romney's play.
I had nothing to do with it.

21:37.999 --> 21:40.735
Maybe he paid the bills,
but you recruited the players.

21:40.735 --> 21:41.335
Nah...

21:41.335 --> 21:44.240
There's nothing like kicking off
a brilliant coaching career...

21:44.240 --> 21:46.350
like a championship team,
right, Mr. Rutherford?

21:46.350 --> 21:50.050
Even if it means getting
in bed with Curtis Romney.

21:52.859 --> 21:54.761
Oh, man.
This thing went so wrong.

21:54.761 --> 21:56.240
I don't know what happened to Corey.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.664
Tell us what you do know.

21:58.664 --> 22:00.448
Corey wanted more playing time.

22:00.448 --> 22:02.250
He worried he wouldn't be scouted for college.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.716
Romney know he was unhappy?

22:03.716 --> 22:07.796
No. I didn't need him knowing
I couldn't manage the problem.

22:08.639 --> 22:12.667
And where did Corey direct his anger...
to you or to the other players?

22:12.667 --> 22:14.588
We looked good on the court.

22:14.588 --> 22:16.627
But in the locker room,
it was ugly.

22:16.627 --> 22:20.618
Bringin' in all those
hotshots just broke the team.

22:20.618 --> 22:22.993
What did you do after Corey's last game?

22:22.993 --> 22:26.348
I turned the stat sheet into Powell,
and I met my wife for dinner.

22:26.348 --> 22:28.044
And the players after the game,

22:28.044 --> 22:32.407
you and Coach Powell steer clear of them?

22:32.407 --> 22:34.925
Yeah. Especially after a close game.

22:34.925 --> 22:37.865
It's their time.

22:37.865 --> 22:42.057
The restaurant confirmed Rutherford
and his wife were there until just after 11:00.

22:42.057 --> 22:43.296
Another solid alibi.

22:43.296 --> 22:46.277
I'd like to see us pin a suspect
down long enough to make a case.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.092
Maybe we can pin down
where Corey went into the water.

22:48.092 --> 22:52.460
The lab found high concentrations
of chromite, lead and asbestos...

22:52.460 --> 22:54.605
in the water in his lungs.

22:54.605 --> 23:00.324
The red brick dust in his sinuses...
building materials.

23:02.551 --> 23:06.633
Uh, the city's been tearing
down a housing project...

23:06.633 --> 23:09.878
on 142nd...

23:09.878 --> 23:14.770
and Fifth...
on Harlem River Drive.

23:14.770 --> 23:18.298
Contractor's been cited for
dumping materials into the river.

23:18.298 --> 23:22.944
School's on 124th.
He lived on 116th.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.761
What's he doing all
the way up on 142nd Street?

23:25.761 --> 23:29.639
One of the players lived on 143rd and Lennox...
two blocks away.

23:29.639 --> 23:33.836
"Benjamin Watkins."

23:36.493 --> 23:41.366
Well, he's been playin' with
the team for three years.

23:41.366 --> 23:44.878
And he was alternating with
Corey on point guard.

23:44.878 --> 23:47.756
"Alternating."

23:47.756 --> 23:51.146
Nice way to say "cutthroat competition."

23:51.146 --> 23:54.969
You should see him.
He's so excited.

23:54.969 --> 23:57.955
Yes, I will.
I'll call when the plane lands.

23:57.955 --> 23:59.957
Mom, we're ready.

23:59.957 --> 24:02.510
I have to go.

24:02.510 --> 24:05.625
We can't thank you enough.

24:05.625 --> 24:09.861
Congratulations, Ben.
You're now a Mid-Iowa Tiger.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.821
If he went in more downriver on
the opposite side of the dump site,

24:15.821 --> 24:17.483
the concentration would have been more diluted.

24:17.483 --> 24:19.649
Or if he went in more upriver,

24:19.649 --> 24:23.608
the water in his lungs would
have been filled with cleaner water.

24:23.608 --> 24:27.299
He was shoved against the rail.

24:27.299 --> 24:33.190
He was punched in the throat with
enough force to send him over.

24:42.137 --> 24:46.696
Yeah, right here.
This is where he went in.

24:48.154 --> 24:51.579
The last time I saw Corey was
in the locker room after the game.

24:51.579 --> 24:53.051
Then I went home.

24:53.051 --> 24:56.139
- And you were at the game, Ms. Watkins?
- Just the second half.

24:56.139 --> 24:58.800
I was working at a plant store
down at Chelsea Market.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.447
I'm assistant manager.

25:00.447 --> 25:02.775
And, uh, you and Ben came home together?

25:02.775 --> 25:06.316
No. I...
stayed to talk with friends.

25:06.316 --> 25:09.196
And-And I was beat.
I just wanted to get home.

25:09.196 --> 25:10.378
But you won that night, didn't you?

25:10.378 --> 25:13.782
Didn't you wanna celebrate
with the other guys?

25:15.643 --> 25:19.614
Is it because they felt
that you took Corey's spot?

25:19.614 --> 25:23.249
No. That was my spot for
three years before he came along.

25:23.249 --> 25:25.130
Uh, isn't Corey the better point guard?

25:25.130 --> 25:27.783
No. Ben is a very good player.

25:27.783 --> 25:30.743
He has a scholarship from a college in Iowa.

25:30.743 --> 25:33.337
Congratulations.

25:35.174 --> 25:39.110
Paul died five years ago of a heart attack.

25:40.504 --> 25:46.560
Well, I'm sure he would
have been proud of... the two of you.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.094
Ben?

25:49.094 --> 25:52.584
We think that Corey was in
this neighborhood after the game.

25:52.584 --> 25:55.989
Do you have any idea why he'd be here?

25:55.989 --> 25:56.946
No.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.172
Maybe he was following you...

25:59.172 --> 26:00.982
wanted to provoke you,
get you into a fight.

26:00.982 --> 26:02.996
Detectives, that's not what he said.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.880
He wouldn't mess with me.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.717
He knew better.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.193
What's that supposed to mean?

26:11.193 --> 26:13.802
Nothin'. I told you.

26:13.802 --> 26:15.624
I just came home and went in my room.

26:15.624 --> 26:18.836
Yeah, but you won an important game.
You played well.

26:18.836 --> 26:22.040
- Why hide in your room?
- Because I didn't play well.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.861
I missed half my free throws.

26:24.861 --> 26:28.575
I just...
wanted to be with myself.

26:28.575 --> 26:32.319
Fifty percent from the line.

26:32.319 --> 26:33.128
That's a rough night.

26:33.128 --> 26:35.083
I don't want you talking to my son anymore,

26:35.083 --> 26:38.536
and I don't want you in my house.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.740
Attempted field goal... 19.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.304
Rebound... 22.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.728
Uh, blocked shot... 26.

26:48.728 --> 26:51.585
Uh, field goal... 22.

26:51.585 --> 26:53.397
Steal... 18.

26:53.397 --> 26:54.695
You have something for me?

26:54.695 --> 26:59.768
Ben Watkins said he missed half of
his free throws during Corey's last game.

26:59.768 --> 27:04.024
The box score in the Ledger
has him making 10 out of 12.

27:04.024 --> 27:06.978
What kind of an athlete lies
to make himself look bad?

27:06.978 --> 27:09.857
Well, we tallied up the stats
from the last five games...

27:09.857 --> 27:12.674
and checked them against the stats
the team gave the city league.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.713
They all match except for Ben's.

27:14.713 --> 27:16.765
His stats were pumped up across the board...

27:16.765 --> 27:19.462
rebounds, free throws, field goals.

27:19.462 --> 27:21.621
Somebody's makin' him look good.

27:21.621 --> 27:23.782
Good enough for a college scholarship.

27:23.782 --> 27:27.316
Maybe this is what Corey found out was going on.

27:27.316 --> 27:30.780
College education,
ticket out of the neighborhood.

27:30.780 --> 27:34.483
Two lives must be the going price.

27:37.507 --> 27:40.405
Ben's stats have been inflated
over the last three months.

27:40.405 --> 27:42.913
It has to be either Rutherford or Powell.

27:42.913 --> 27:46.716
Rutherford's the one with
the motive to pump up Ben's stats...

27:46.716 --> 27:49.022
to hide the fact that
there were ringers on the team.

27:49.022 --> 27:51.406
So Corey Fergin discovered this fraud.

27:51.406 --> 27:54.074
He confronted Ben Watkins,
who then killed him.

27:54.074 --> 27:56.688
Well, we know Bracho talked to
some of the players.

27:56.688 --> 27:59.836
Ben might have been afraid
Bracho would find out the truth.

27:59.836 --> 28:02.028
He lured him to the park and shot him.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.683
Mm-hmm. With what gun?

28:04.683 --> 28:08.937
Ben's father died of a heart attack behind
the counter of his convenience store.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.242
It's on 125th Street.

28:11.242 --> 28:12.952
Convenience store.

28:12.952 --> 28:16.239
A gun's practically standard equipment.

28:16.239 --> 28:18.094
I told you. Paul and I never owned a gun.

28:18.094 --> 28:20.610
There's nothing in there but personal items.

28:20.610 --> 28:22.798
It's broken.

28:22.798 --> 28:24.754
Empty.

28:24.754 --> 28:27.098
No gun.

28:27.741 --> 28:30.863
You should be relieved, Mrs. Watkins,
but you're not.

28:30.863 --> 28:31.712
Why aren't you?

28:31.712 --> 28:33.245
L-I don't know what you're talking about.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.899
- Well...
- Mom.! Why are the police here?

28:36.899 --> 28:38.721
What are you doin' here?
Where's my mother?

28:38.721 --> 28:40.690
She's okay. She's okay.
Where is it, Ben?

28:40.690 --> 28:44.037
Tell me where the gun that
your mom kept in the desk is, Ben.

28:44.037 --> 28:45.292
Come on.
I don't have it anymore.

28:45.292 --> 28:46.769
Not anymore.
That means you took the gun.

28:46.769 --> 28:48.071
Yeah, but I had to give it up.

28:48.071 --> 28:49.975
Is that why you said
Corey didn't wanna mess with you...

28:49.975 --> 28:52.333
- because you showed him a gun?
- You can't talk to him. He's 17.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.714
Is that why Corey never called you out...

28:53.714 --> 28:56.512
when he knew that your stats were phonied up?

28:56.512 --> 29:00.757
My stats?
What's wrong with my stats?

29:00.757 --> 29:03.677
What, are you gonna tell us that
you don't know about that?

29:03.677 --> 29:06.656
No more.
Come on.

29:12.589 --> 29:14.084
He doesn't know?

29:14.084 --> 29:16.717
No. He doesn't have a clue about anything.

29:16.717 --> 29:20.951
The gun, he brought it
to school to scare Corey.

29:20.951 --> 29:22.200
Maybe somebody caught him with it.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.776
By someone who didn't report it...

29:24.776 --> 29:27.388
one of the coaches.

29:27.388 --> 29:30.128
Home of Coach Powell 440 West
163Rd Street, Monday, January 20

29:30.128 --> 29:33.535
Picket-fence play.
Four players in a row,

29:33.535 --> 29:35.913
fifth dribbles behind.
It's old-school.

29:35.913 --> 29:37.900
Everything about Powell is old-school.

29:37.900 --> 29:41.896
I think he stopped buying jackets
when Wilt Chamberlain retired.

29:41.896 --> 29:45.571
These must be his former
players and their kids.

29:45.571 --> 29:48.775
It's beginning to look a little
like Goodbye, Mr. Chips in here.

29:48.775 --> 29:51.832
At least Mr. Chips had a wife.

29:52.410 --> 29:56.049
Cranberry seedling.

29:56.049 --> 30:01.995
With my dad, it was avocado
pits in a glass of water.

30:06.524 --> 30:09.830
TV.

30:09.830 --> 30:12.670
He stood over the sink,

30:12.670 --> 30:15.160
and he ate while he watched TV.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.878
Something you do?

30:16.878 --> 30:19.355
No.

30:19.355 --> 30:24.323
No. I found the same arrangement
when I cleaned out my dad's apartment.

30:27.549 --> 30:33.937
Huh.
Looks like Mr. Chips is buying a home.

30:33.937 --> 30:36.132
An ad from a home insurance company.

30:36.132 --> 30:38.095
"Call for free quotes."

30:38.095 --> 30:42.326
And he wrote in the margins...
"Fire, theft, sump pump."

30:42.326 --> 30:45.045
- Hmm.
- Sump pump insurance?

30:45.045 --> 30:47.965
Sump pumps keep water out of basements.

30:47.965 --> 30:53.996
You'd only need to add that to your policy
if you lived in a... a flood plain.

31:06.138 --> 31:10.632
Iowa has flood plains.

31:10.632 --> 31:12.323
We checked Powell's credit report.

31:12.323 --> 31:14.339
He applied for a mortgage
on a two-bedroom house...

31:14.339 --> 31:16.995
a half an hour's drive from Mid-Iowa College.

31:16.995 --> 31:18.870
- A house?
- Right.

31:18.870 --> 31:22.771
For Mr. Powell,
Ben Watkins and his mother.

31:22.771 --> 31:24.935
Mr. Powell and Ms. Watkins
are having an affair?

31:24.935 --> 31:29.849
We haven't found any actual evidence
of one in either of their homes.

31:29.849 --> 31:33.889
But Powell probably inflated Ben's
stats to help him get into college.

31:33.889 --> 31:35.953
And he put a down payment on a house.

31:35.953 --> 31:37.337
It's hard to imagine that he'd do either

31:37.337 --> 31:41.095
unless he had some hope for a relationship.

31:41.095 --> 31:46.641
And Ms. Watkins gave him that hope?

31:46.641 --> 31:49.576
She might have said it with flowers.

31:49.576 --> 31:53.044
Powell has a, uh, cranberry
seedling in his kitchen.

31:53.044 --> 31:55.947
Now, according to this,
a gift of a cranberry plant...

31:55.947 --> 31:59.214
"is a cure for the lonely heart."

31:59.214 --> 32:03.539
That's something a florist would think of.

32:04.461 --> 32:07.219
I know this guy.

32:07.219 --> 32:12.097
He's a lonely man with a shot at happiness.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.060
He's gonna fight for it.

32:14.060 --> 32:17.284
Well, lucky for him
Karen Watkins is covering his back.

32:17.284 --> 32:19.370
She won't let her son tell us about the gun.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.517
She doesn't wanna jeopardize his scholarship.

32:21.517 --> 32:23.501
- Or Coach Powell.
- Right.

32:23.501 --> 32:27.783
I wonder about her feelings for Coach Powell.

32:27.783 --> 32:30.092
Romney.

32:30.092 --> 32:33.626
So it was Romney after all.

32:33.626 --> 32:35.527
That's what we told the D.A.

32:35.527 --> 32:37.246
And those searches...

32:37.246 --> 32:43.259
Ben Watkins's home,
my home, my office.

32:43.259 --> 32:46.605
Those were mistakes.

32:46.605 --> 32:51.731
I'm sorry, Coach,
for embarrassing you.

32:53.239 --> 32:57.096
That's not the only reason I came here.

32:57.096 --> 32:59.110
You know, when the D.A.
Prosecutes Romney,

32:59.110 --> 33:00.178
other facts are gonna come out...

33:00.178 --> 33:02.772
facts that have nothing
to do with Corey's murder.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.447
Spit it out, Goren.

33:05.447 --> 33:08.937
Ben's stats.

33:11.452 --> 33:15.470
The D.A. Will be obliged to notify
the school board and the college...

33:15.470 --> 33:17.660
that they were altered.

33:17.660 --> 33:20.023
There'll be criminal charges.

33:20.023 --> 33:25.695
A civil suit.
Even if you don't go to jail,

33:25.695 --> 33:28.553
they'll take your pension.

33:28.553 --> 33:32.920
But if the college were to get a letter now...

33:32.920 --> 33:38.261
correcting the stats,

33:39.007 --> 33:42.491
there'd be no harm, no foul.

33:42.491 --> 33:46.166
Look, you shouldn't lose everything
because you helped this kid.

33:46.166 --> 33:51.530
You know, when my father died,

33:51.530 --> 33:54.148
he had just enough money to, uh,

33:54.148 --> 33:57.531
cover his funeral.

33:59.922 --> 34:03.369
That shouldn't happen to you.

34:04.765 --> 34:08.618
Thanks for the heads-up.

34:20.371 --> 34:23.375
Karen, I'm just sayin',

34:23.375 --> 34:25.926
even though Ben has the scholarship,

34:25.926 --> 34:28.400
he should keep his options open.

34:28.400 --> 34:34.056
He's made up his mind, Perry.
It's all he can talk about.

34:34.056 --> 34:37.547
As long as nothing upsets
what we've worked for.

34:37.547 --> 34:40.038
I've done everything I can for him, Karen.

34:40.038 --> 34:44.449
I know.
You won't be disappointed.

34:46.063 --> 34:48.022
Ben will be home from the movie soon.

34:48.022 --> 34:51.659
I'll wrap up some cake for you.

35:05.101 --> 35:07.084
Sorry. Bad time, Coach?

35:07.084 --> 35:10.485
There's a game tonight.
I have to prepare.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.525
What do you want?

35:12.525 --> 35:16.100
Well, we just hit a snag in the Romney case.

35:16.100 --> 35:19.285
"Snag"?

35:20.377 --> 35:22.867
I've already told you everything I know.

35:22.867 --> 35:24.596
I'll explain more when my partner gets back.

35:24.596 --> 35:26.994
You know, when we were searching your place,

35:26.994 --> 35:30.154
you were working on the picket-fence play.

35:30.154 --> 35:31.689
I want the team to know it.

35:31.689 --> 35:33.632
They all play the one-on-one game now.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.398
That picket-fence play, that's...
That's a classic of teamwork.

35:37.398 --> 35:39.787
That's right.

35:39.787 --> 35:45.279
Well, maybe with a little teamwork,
we can all get over this snag.

35:47.873 --> 35:50.712
Ah, Mrs. Watkins.

35:50.712 --> 35:51.786
Why are you here?

35:51.786 --> 35:55.430
This involves her too.
Please have a seat.

35:56.963 --> 36:02.800
So, the snag.
It's the gun.

36:02.800 --> 36:05.280
I told you there was never a gun.
Ben just misunderstood.

36:05.280 --> 36:11.348
Now, look, we all want to make sure...
that Ben gets to that college in Iowa.

36:11.348 --> 36:17.281
So, Ms. Watkins,
you kept the gun in the desk.

36:17.281 --> 36:20.199
Yes. Yes, I did.

36:20.199 --> 36:22.387
And Ben took it to school.

36:22.387 --> 36:24.925
Yes, I believe he did.

36:24.925 --> 36:26.497
Well, good. Good.

36:26.497 --> 36:29.674
Now all we need to do is explain
what happened to that gun.

36:29.674 --> 36:31.479
Ben said that he gave it up,

36:31.479 --> 36:36.946
and I'm thinkin;...
that a benevolent authority figure...

36:36.946 --> 36:39.928
took it away from him.
You know, a basketball coach for example.

36:39.928 --> 36:42.216
All right. I took it from him...

36:42.216 --> 36:44.587
before he did something foolish with it.

36:44.587 --> 36:47.489
And that would be how long ago?

36:47.489 --> 36:48.615
Three months.

36:48.615 --> 36:50.314
And what did you do with it?

36:50.314 --> 36:52.523
I returned it to Mrs. Watkins.

36:52.523 --> 36:56.075
I told her she shouldn't keep a gun
in the house, to get rid of the thing.

36:56.075 --> 36:57.673
I threw it in the river.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.943
Three months ago?

37:00.943 --> 37:05.105
That's when Ben's stats
started improving, isn't it?

37:05.105 --> 37:07.069
I guess. L-I'm not sure.

37:07.069 --> 37:09.274
Coach started paying more attention to Ben.

37:09.274 --> 37:11.542
- I'm sure you noticed that.
- Yes.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.747
You started paying
more attention to... to Coach.

37:14.747 --> 37:18.511
And you paid attention to him,
Coach paid attention to Ben,

37:18.511 --> 37:24.770
Ben's stats kept improving.

37:24.770 --> 37:27.134
It's nice how that worked out,
isn't it?

37:27.134 --> 37:28.542
Don't take that tone with her.

37:28.542 --> 37:32.427
You're not gonna keep denying this,
are ya? Are ya?

37:32.427 --> 37:37.016
The cranberry seedling from your store.

37:37.016 --> 37:40.814
After all, a guy can only...

37:40.814 --> 37:45.602
spend so many nights eatin'
over the kitchen sink.

37:45.602 --> 37:49.075
He can only look at so many
pictures of his former players...

37:49.075 --> 37:52.339
with their wives and their kids...

37:52.339 --> 37:55.301
before he's gotta grab that
brass ring for himself.

37:55.301 --> 37:57.455
Now you stop this right now.

37:57.455 --> 38:00.959
He told you that...

38:00.959 --> 38:05.911
that he wanted to help Ben
qualify for a scholarship,

38:05.911 --> 38:10.438
how with a little sweat
and a few encouraging words...

38:10.438 --> 38:13.339
He left out the part about
pumping up Ben's stats, didn't he?

38:13.339 --> 38:16.369
It's not true.
Ben earned those stats.

38:16.369 --> 38:20.818
I've seen my son play.
L-I trust Coach Powell.

38:23.411 --> 38:25.544
You... You know how to pick 'em, Coach.

38:25.544 --> 38:26.890
Now, you go ahead, Goren.

38:26.890 --> 38:29.687
You get it all out, all that defiance.

38:29.687 --> 38:33.913
You see that? His understanding
of what makes a young man tick...

38:33.913 --> 38:37.929
it's like a gift.

38:37.929 --> 38:39.521
You're lucky, you know,

38:39.521 --> 38:42.484
he'll be sharing that with you and your son...

38:42.484 --> 38:45.042
out there on the flood plains of Iowa.

38:45.042 --> 38:46.931
- What are you talk...
- Okay, that's it!

38:46.931 --> 38:50.054
Oh, was that supposed to be a surprise?

38:50.054 --> 38:55.423
The coach put a down payment on
a two-bedroom house near your son's college.

38:55.423 --> 38:58.724
Yeah. That's one bedroom for Ben
and one bedroom for you and-and...

38:58.724 --> 39:02.478
well, the coach.

39:04.602 --> 39:07.789
Karen, now's not the time.

39:07.789 --> 39:11.607
I think he means now's not the time
to jeopardize your son's scholarship.

39:11.607 --> 39:14.503
Shut up.
This is none of your business!

39:14.503 --> 39:16.671
Perry and I wanted to keep things low-key,

39:16.671 --> 39:19.511
so Ben wouldn't find out
until we were ready to tell him.

39:19.511 --> 39:21.984
You mean, like the occasional date or...

39:21.984 --> 39:23.924
ride home after the games.

39:23.924 --> 39:27.875
Yes. Perry's been very proper.
I appreciate that.

39:27.875 --> 39:30.814
I'm sure you do.

39:30.814 --> 39:35.181
The game... a few weeks ago,

39:35.181 --> 39:39.376
Corey Fergin's last game.

39:39.376 --> 39:42.764
Coach drive you home?

39:42.764 --> 39:44.972
No. No, I took the bus.

39:44.972 --> 39:47.809
Now, uh, you were thinkin'
about your son's scholarship

39:47.809 --> 39:50.156
when you answered that question,
weren't you?

39:50.156 --> 39:53.488
Wanted to make sure you did
the right thing didn't put

39:53.488 --> 39:55.427
the coach outside your home,

39:55.427 --> 39:57.963
a block from where Corey was murdered.

39:57.963 --> 40:01.086
But don't worry.
You know, you-you did fine.

40:01.086 --> 40:03.762
There's one more thing. You said that
you threw the gun in the river.

40:03.762 --> 40:05.380
- Yes.
- Then why were you surprised,

40:05.380 --> 40:07.896
when we opened the compartment,
it was empty?

40:07.896 --> 40:09.338
L-I'm not sure.

40:09.338 --> 40:12.320
See? There you go, thinkin'
about your son's scholarship again.

40:12.320 --> 40:18.337
You know what? If I was you,
I wouldn't think about it so hard.

40:18.337 --> 40:22.714
Coach Powell faxed the college
a correction of Ben's stats.

40:22.714 --> 40:24.420
He was afraid he'd be charged with fraud

40:24.420 --> 40:26.608
if they discovered what he'd done.

40:26.608 --> 40:29.102
You what?
What does that mean?

40:29.102 --> 40:33.504
It means the college revoked Ben's scholarship.

40:34.185 --> 40:38.848
It doesn't matter, Karen.
I have savings.

40:38.848 --> 40:41.438
I'll pay for his college.

40:41.438 --> 40:45.754
Won't that be paradise, huh?
Livin'off the coach's savings.

40:45.754 --> 40:48.185
Nice little house, middle of nowhere...

40:48.185 --> 40:49.370
just the three of you.

40:49.370 --> 40:51.937
No, never. I don't love you.
This is about Ben.

40:51.937 --> 40:55.462
Couldn't you see that?

40:55.462 --> 40:59.828
Ms. Watkins, did he drive
you home that night after the game?

40:59.828 --> 41:03.168
He used your son to get to you.
He killed another boy.

41:03.168 --> 41:05.553
He told your son that he was a great player.

41:05.553 --> 41:07.555
He made your son believe it.

41:07.555 --> 41:08.990
What's he gonna say to your son now?

41:08.990 --> 41:12.029
I can still help Ben.
I can make him into something.

41:12.029 --> 41:15.360
Oh, listen to the coach.
He's just molding that clay,

41:15.360 --> 41:18.283
just moldin'it until he gets
what he wants out of it.

41:18.283 --> 41:21.694
I can. I mean it.

41:21.694 --> 41:28.031
Did he drive you home that night?

41:28.031 --> 41:29.565
Give me a chance, Karen.

41:29.565 --> 41:33.617
Yes, he did. He drove me.
He tried to kiss me.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.282
I saw someone watching us.

41:35.282 --> 41:37.212
Karen, please, don't...
don't do this.

41:37.212 --> 41:39.502
Someone on a bike.

41:39.502 --> 41:43.375
I got out of the car and went upstairs.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.442
And then, later, he called me.

41:45.442 --> 41:51.371
He said never to tell anyone
he'd been there that night.

41:51.371 --> 41:59.178
It's because Corey confronted him
after seeing him with you.

41:59.178 --> 42:04.865
So he took Corey for
a walk down by the river,

42:04.865 --> 42:11.034
this kid who was just
fightin' for his own future.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.953
And the gun?

42:15.953 --> 42:19.748
He came over for coffee the next week.

42:19.748 --> 42:24.438
I left him in the apartment
while I ran down to the laundry room.

42:24.438 --> 42:27.869
He knew where I kept the gun.

42:27.869 --> 42:32.760
Didn't you see how Ben looked up to you?

42:38.081 --> 42:41.305
Coach, you're under arrest.

42:44.328 --> 42:48.221
Heads-up, huh? You really got
the old man good, didn't you?

42:48.221 --> 42:51.304
Well, that's how I beat all
my men on the court, Coach...

42:51.304 --> 42:53.065
head fake.

42:53.065 --> 42:56.576
The way you talk about the game,
it's just as well you stopped playing.

42:56.576 --> 43:00.898
You got no love for it.

43:03.833 --> 43:07.179
Well, he is hardly one to talk.

43:07.179 --> 43:10.193
No, he's right.

43:10.193 --> 43:12.603
I stopped lovin' the game...

43:12.603 --> 43:17.051
when I saw it... it wasn't
getting me what I wanted.
