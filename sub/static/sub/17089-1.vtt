<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

00:06.360 --> 00:10.399
<i>... it's a pleasure for me to be here
on such a beautiful day...</i>

00:10.600 --> 00:13.239
<i>... in the great city of Detroit.</i>

00:14.400 --> 00:16.960
<i>And I'd love to tell you all...</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:20.516
<i>... to sit back, relax and enjoy yourselves.</i>

00:21.080 --> 00:22.877
<i>I'd love to...</i>

00:23.040 --> 00:26.032
<i>... but unfortunately, I can't do that.</i>

00:26.520 --> 00:30.877
<i>There's a very serious issue spiraling
out of control in this country.</i>

00:31.040 --> 00:34.316
<i>Illegal handguns ending up
in the hands of our children.</i>

00:37.480 --> 00:42.076
<i>Instead of reading off statistics
that you might not already know...</i>

00:42.280 --> 00:47.149
<i>... that last year, more preschoolers died
from guns than police officers...</i>

00:47.360 --> 00:50.716
<i>... or that gunshot wounds
are the second leading cause of death...</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:53.189
<i>... for all people in the U.S., ages 10 to 34.</i>

00:55.960 --> 00:58.428
Hold it. Go on in.

<i>While he lay bleeding to death
for 40 minutes, waiting for help to come.</i>

01:24.440 --> 01:26.749
<i>Darren was 16 years old.</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:30.033
<i>That could've been any one
of your children.</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:34.748
<i>I hope you'll consider my four-year plan
to get guns off the streets.</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:37.791
<i>I need your help and your support.</i>

01:38.440 --> 01:42.479
<i>Let's stop the pain and suffering
Darren's family had to go through.</i>

01:42.560 --> 01:44.312
<i>God bless you and thank you.</i>

01:47.400 --> 01:51.154
- He just loves pissing me off.
- I'm sure he has his reasons.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.279
Thanks a lot.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.194
Thank you.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.229
Relax.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.753
I'll talk to him.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.479
Thank you, everybody.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.194
How are you? Good to see you.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.838
Mr. Vice President, sir?

03:01.120 --> 03:03.031
Bobby, what the hell is this?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.199
You believe this guy?

03:21.120 --> 03:23.793
Sorry, the bridge is closed
until the V.P. gets across.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.275
You can't stay here.
You have to move it out.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.719
- Shit!
- Get down, sir!

03:38.920 --> 03:40.148
Get us out of here!

03:47.480 --> 03:48.469
Excuse me.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.399
<i>Officers need help!
On the bridge! Shots fired!</i>

03:53.560 --> 03:57.917
<i>Warn the D.P., they are dressed as cops!
Repeat: They are dressed as cops!</i>

03:58.320 --> 04:00.629
<i>Alpha six to Bravo Air, keep cover...</i>

04:06.000 --> 04:07.991
- Stay down!
- What the hell is going on?

04:09.480 --> 04:12.119
<i>No cops on the bridge.
We can't tell who's who.</i>

04:12.320 --> 04:15.118
<i>No Detroit P.D., Secret Service only.</i>

04:17.120 --> 04:19.394
Officers need help.
Motorcade's under attack!

04:19.480 --> 04:22.074
<i>All units, stay off the bridge,
as per Secret Service.</i>

04:31.760 --> 04:33.318
<i>All units stay off bridge...</i>

04:33.400 --> 04:35.550
Goddamn it, I told you to clear the bridge!

04:35.800 --> 04:37.438
Bring the truck in!

04:42.120 --> 04:44.315
Goddamn it! Secret Service only!

04:44.520 --> 04:45.794
Who the hell is that?

04:58.840 --> 04:59.795
Get me out!

05:05.800 --> 05:07.313
- Get me out of here!
- Get in.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.511
Who the hell are you? Off the bridge.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.875
We're not moving till the transport arrives.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.599
I'm not talking to you!
Mr. Vice President, get in here!

05:17.160 --> 05:18.957
We need help here now!

05:20.640 --> 05:22.631
<i>Alpha one to Alpha six.</i>

05:25.080 --> 05:27.514
Move it out! Everything's under control!

05:28.320 --> 05:29.036
Jesus!

05:29.240 --> 05:30.673
<i>Take out the Alpha vehicle!</i>

06:21.560 --> 06:23.676
I'm sorry, sir. I got to do this.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.718
Shit! I can't swim.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.759
Don't move!

06:44.960 --> 06:46.075
Freeze!

06:46.280 --> 06:47.838
It's okay. I'm on the job.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.519
We got you, sir.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.517
You're going to be all right, sir.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.358
Why did you drive onto that bridge
and start World War III?

07:05.560 --> 07:08.120
- I saved his life, Frank.
- You were lucky, Orin.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.315
Extremely lucky.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.676
The Secret Service gave a direct order
not to storm that bridge!

07:12.920 --> 07:15.388
They were responsible for him. Not you!

07:15.760 --> 07:18.433
- What if it went the other way?
- I didn't vote for him.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.953
This is funny to you?

07:20.160 --> 07:22.037
- What's funny to me is...
- Cut it out.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.915
Who were they?

07:25.560 --> 07:27.198
Some Michigan militant group.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.511
- Live by the sword, man.
- Sit down.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.759
Look, Orin.
We've known each other a long time.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.391
I am your friend, but also your boss.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.070
As your friend, you don't follow orders.
You're unmanageable.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.669
You don't obey the law
or think before you act.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.917
And now, as your boss, you're fired.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.196
- Just like that.
- Hinges wants you out.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.833
There's nothing I can do.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.389
You want to talk to him yourself,
be my guest.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.833
<i>Now handle it!</i>

08:05.960 --> 08:08.269
You are like a cockroach, Mr. Boyd.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.750
Every time I try to get rid of you,
you appeal to the union...

08:11.840 --> 08:14.195
...and they send your ass right back here.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.829
But not this time.

08:16.520 --> 08:20.195
I've been talking to the Secret Service
figuring out what to do with you.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.592
They want you to suffer, Mr. Boyd.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.037
They want you to suffer bad
for that stupid stunt you pulled.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.957
And I must say, I do not disagree.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.232
You guys are unbelievable.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.908
I saw a problem, I fixed it. Simple as that.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.957
That's bullshit, Mr. Boyd.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.150
Because of cops like you...

08:39.799 --> 08:41.791
...police have a bad image everywhere.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.192
You won't pin that on me.
I stick my neck out every day.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.915
You remind me of bureaucrats in the '60s
sending kids to fight in Vietnam.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.116
I'm not going to send you to Vietnam.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.033
- I'm going to send you to the 15th.
- That shithole.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.712
You'll fit right in.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.435
Come on, get up.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.437
I know my rights, man.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.389
Knock off the shit!

09:18.960 --> 09:20.075
Understand?

09:21.280 --> 09:22.713
Can I help you?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.150
I'm looking for the ringleader of this circus.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.710
Yes, sir. And you are?

09:27.800 --> 09:30.997
- Boyd. The commander's expecting me.
- Follow me.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.917
Commander's got a grip on things.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.350
I've seen mental wards
saner than this place.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.869
Can we start over?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.119
Too late for first impressions. Sit.

10:10.960 --> 10:15.033
This year alone, three complaints
filed against you for excessive force.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.395
This doesn't seem like a hero's welcome.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.074
You want to be welcomed?
Stay out of the headlines.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.549
Around here,
there's no such thing as heroes.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.269
I've got community activists swearing
we treat everybody like criminals...

10:26.360 --> 10:28.794
...and criminals all swearing
they're altar boys.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.838
Maybe I was never an altar boy,
but the point is...

10:32.080 --> 10:35.311
The point is,
cops don't uphold the law by breaking it.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.073
Now, you got a problem in my house,
you come see me.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.073
None of this Lone Ranger stuff
that I keep hearing about.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.399
Are you listening?

10:44.480 --> 10:47.119
If I have a problem,
I'll come and see the commander.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.715
All that stuff with the Vice President?
A little water never hurt anybody.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.270
But I am worried
about your discipline problem.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.830
I was thinking about putting you on a desk.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.668
- I can't type.
- I have a better idea.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.910
Something that will broaden your horizons.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.148
And then her dog.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.508
Her dog gets so freaked out...

11:11.920 --> 11:15.230
...he takes this enormous shit...

11:15.440 --> 11:17.749
...right in the middle of the living room.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.349
I chased that little bastard everywhere...

11:23.840 --> 11:25.592
...until I finally cornered him.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.114
I warned her not to buy a frigging poodle.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.357
I never could have thrown
a German Shepherd out the window.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.629
Okay.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.153
That's it. Let it out.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.708
Okay? That's why we're here.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.469
To talk through our problems,
not to let it bottle up.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.669
Okay.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.277
And the rest of you,
I want you to dig down deep...

11:57.520 --> 11:59.795
...and ask yourself the question:

12:00.640 --> 12:04.030
Why are we mad and what are we mad at?

12:05.480 --> 12:06.879
Good. Okay.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.152
Who'd like to go next?

12:11.680 --> 12:12.795
Hey, everyone.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.790
How are you?

12:13.880 --> 12:17.714
For those of you just tuning in, my name
is Henry Wayne, and I'm a rageaholic.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.758
<i>You probably all recognize me
from my show, Detroit A.M.</i>

12:22.840 --> 12:25.673
You're probably wondering
what happened to my head here.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.832
I know it's always something,
and I shouldn't lose my cool.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.275
I was at Krispy Kreme,
picking up a twelve-pack.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.839
- And this guy...
- Okay.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.634
I'm so sorry to interrupt you but...

12:36.560 --> 12:38.710
...I'm kind of looking for a fresh face next.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.915
I've been sitting there...

12:40.000 --> 12:41.353
We'll get back to you.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.238
I'm a ticking time bomb,
and I'm ready to implode.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.753
Let's solve my problem.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.070
Sit down!

12:51.480 --> 12:52.435
Okay.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.637
So, who's it going to be?

12:58.240 --> 13:01.835
Mr. Boyd?
I believe that you were sent to us...

13:01.920 --> 13:04.275
...because of work-related stress...

13:04.480 --> 13:06.630
...aggression towards authority figures...

13:06.880 --> 13:09.758
...and an all-around lack of discipline.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.754
I'm fine. You can move on.
Other people want to say something.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.357
Mr. Boyd, denial is a classic symptom
of unhealthy rage.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.472
Okay? So why don't you just stand up...

13:21.680 --> 13:24.478
...and tell us a little bit about yourself.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.988
I'd like to make this clear:
I don't have rage.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.471
I'm a happy guy. You see this face?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.430
This is a happy face. You all...

13:49.760 --> 13:52.479
...would be lucky to be as happy as I am.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.396
What am I, a shit magnet?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.112
Junior, having a tough time?

14:21.200 --> 14:24.078
You got to get in and out quick.
I'm an expert at this.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.991
I could do that in a blink of an eye.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.514
- Why don't you show us?
- Watch.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.994
- Just like that. See?
- You a magician?

14:32.120 --> 14:35.192
You want me to show you
how to pull a rabbit out of your ass?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.749
Screw Linda. Come on back in.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.149
Everybody's tearing
the tops off their desks.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.793
Who the hell are you?

14:42.880 --> 14:44.836
<i>Henry Wayne. Detroit A.M.</i>

14:45.440 --> 14:47.351
- This a friend of yours?
- Yeah.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.154
- Go back to class.
- They're gonna kill me without you.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.277
If you stay here, they might kill you, too,
so go back to class.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.711
Jeez! Well, no! Well, shit!

14:57.920 --> 14:59.638
I don't even know this guy.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.669
Stay out of our class.
We got people in there with real problems.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.277
FYI, next week
I'm doing a show on violent twins.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.510
- Enough of this bullshit!
- You're not twins?

15:09.720 --> 15:10.948
Take the man's keys.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.268
Give me your keys.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.113
Stop it! Mr. Boyd, stop hitting that man!

15:48.360 --> 15:51.955
Mr. Boyd! What're you doing?
This is no way to deal with your anger.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.476
Screw that, man! You kill
those bastards! They tried to pop us!

15:55.960 --> 15:58.679
Did you guys see that?
Can you believe this shit?

15:59.160 --> 16:02.835
Boyd is such a bad-ass. He could easily
win a tough-men competition.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.992
You guys just missed it,
but I'm glad I got here when I did.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.510
Boyd's a cop! He's a cop!
He gets to do this shit all the time!

16:09.720 --> 16:11.950
We're going to have
great stories for group!

16:15.240 --> 16:17.071
You see how happy I make others?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.349
Hey, Boyd.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.713
Good job, man.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.073
We'll see you next week?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.716
Come on, guys! That was great!

16:34.920 --> 16:37.036
Now, was that cool, or what? Come on!

17:10.200 --> 17:11.679
Who are you here to see?

17:11.880 --> 17:12.949
Shaun Rollins.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.196
- And you are?
- A friend.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.393
Photo I.D.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.348
Sign in.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.353
Back to the left.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.789
How you holding up?

17:47.720 --> 17:48.914
Not too well, man.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.351
Straight losing it, dog.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.750
I can only take so much of this shit.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.117
- What's up with my lawyer?
- I talked to him.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.436
Slow motion. You know, the system.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.153
No, I don't know, man.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.030
I need to know
how much time I'm looking at.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.031
Nobody's telling me nothing.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.714
I don't know.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.759
Fuck, man.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.952
This shit is bullshit.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.716
Fuck do you mean, you don't know?

18:19.480 --> 18:22.358
You got to see the Jeffrey Dahmer
look-alikes in here, man.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.998
It's crazy.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.950
It's like I can't even turn my back
to take a piss up in here, man.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.195
Shaun.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.031
You got to stay focused.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.872
Do whatever you got to do
to make sure that you safe in there.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.036
I got everything on the street covered.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.718
Nobody's forgotten about you.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.314
Nobody.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.671
Don't worry. I've got them.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.872
They're my people,
and if they're not buying, they're walking.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.510
This is what I'm talking about.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.755
Nice color.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.115
If you Puffy.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.554
- Shit!
- Good afternoon, homies.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.599
I'm Alan Morris, and if there's anything
I could help you with, I'm your dog.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.592
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Is that the new 993 Turbo?

19:56.680 --> 19:59.558
Actually, that's the 993 Carrera.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.997
Shit! It got 8 cylinders?
They kick out 600 horsepower, right?

20:04.200 --> 20:07.351
That's 6 cylinders, 475 horsepower.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.829
Whatever.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.070
Would you mind not leaning on the...

20:11.160 --> 20:14.277
Shit! I could get some ass
from the twins in this, dog.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.152
Hello, Mrs. Johnson. How are you?

20:19.480 --> 20:20.913
Mrs. Johnson got a fat ass.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.596
I got something for you, Mrs. Johnson.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.268
You're not allowed to play any music here.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.998
Could you turn it off, please?

20:29.480 --> 20:31.516
Could you turn the music off, please?

20:32.360 --> 20:35.079
Turn the music off, please, brother.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.276
Look, can you turn the music off, please!

20:42.400 --> 20:45.358
Can you not hear me?
Could you turn the music down, please?

20:49.240 --> 20:51.231
Yeah! Hit it!

20:51.720 --> 20:52.755
It is not a toy.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.996
Mrs. Johnson was shaking her ass.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.274
Mrs. Johnson!
Shake your ass, baby. Shake it!

20:58.400 --> 20:59.389
Mrs. Johnson.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.509
You think I could hit some corners in this?

21:02.600 --> 21:03.999
Take it on a test drive.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.719
I'm sorry. Our policy is no test drives.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.797
How about hooking a brother up then?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.438
Hooking a brother up.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.876
The cheapest car we have here is $75,000.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.235
That it?

21:15.640 --> 21:17.949
- It got a lot of head room. Get it?
- Yo, bro.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.639
This is it.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.598
Oh, yeah.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.316
See? My man got taste.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.232
Yes, well, he's got something.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.789
Shit!

21:29.280 --> 21:31.510
- You like it?
- Yo, dog, this shit is hot, man.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.038
How much? $200,000?

21:34.240 --> 21:35.832
Actually, $285,000.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.114
It better suck and fuck me
for $285,000, man.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.678
Actually, there are only seven of these
for sale in the U.S.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.909
That many.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.316
Pop the hood, man.
I want to see what $285,000 look like.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.794
That's the hood.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.718
That's the trunk.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.275
That's okay.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.239
Yo, start it up, dog.

21:57.320 --> 22:01.074
No, I'm sorry.
It's our policy. You can't start up the car.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.593
It's policy. Sorry.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.549
What in the...

22:06.840 --> 22:07.989
Hey, you!

22:08.320 --> 22:09.958
Turn off the engine!

22:10.440 --> 22:13.716
- Would you turn off the engine, please?
- Yeah, yeah!

22:14.720 --> 22:18.030
Could you turn off
the motherfucking engine?

22:19.560 --> 22:20.993
You don't have to yell.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.958
All you had to do was ask.
You'd get much better results.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.594
- Will you please just leave?
- No.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.153
I want this.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.875
Unless you decide you'd like to live in this,
I suggest that you...

22:33.960 --> 22:37.157
I suggest you get started
on the paperwork.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.033
What do these people think?

22:41.920 --> 22:42.875
Oh, my God.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.519
There's $300,000 in there.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.431
Make sure he gets the commission.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.475
He get...

22:50.280 --> 22:51.349
Keep the change.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.953
Maybe I made a mistake.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.229
You know?

22:55.440 --> 22:59.069
We're both homies.
All of us here. Why don't you...

23:02.280 --> 23:05.556
Homies! I'm your man!

23:08.040 --> 23:11.032
Faster, dog! Yeah! Faster!

23:13.040 --> 23:14.234
Okay, dog, go right.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.512
Sit down, man.
Can't afford to get pulled over.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.118
We got a big night tonight.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.712
Doesn't anybody sleep anymore?

23:59.960 --> 24:03.999
Yeah. Bring you the goods, baby.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.270
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, shit, man!

24:07.360 --> 24:10.989
You always walk up on somebody
like that? Could've given me a coronary.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.479
You mind if I take a look?

24:14.680 --> 24:16.796
- Bird watching?
- No, man.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.599
Just checking on my old lady.
Keeping tabs on her.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.477
Women. You can't trust them.

24:21.640 --> 24:25.110
Not as far as I can throw her ass.
And she a big bitch.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.597
I don't see anything. Where is she?

24:29.200 --> 24:30.952
Up in the corner over there, man.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.155
No luck.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.834
I think maybe you should
go home and call her tomorrow.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.751
Cool. Just give me my shit, bro.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.070
I'm sorry.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.476
Sure enough! Five-O.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.669
Five-O.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.273
Come on, man.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.194
Shit! Come on, man. Quit treating me
like I'm Tupac. It's my hand!

24:49.400 --> 24:50.833
What are you doing?

24:50.920 --> 24:54.151
- I'm a cop. It's all right.
- Since when do cops make things okay?

24:54.240 --> 24:56.151
Yeah, man! Since when do cops make...

24:56.240 --> 24:57.559
Man, this shit hurts!

24:57.640 --> 24:59.517
I'm a political prisoner here, man!

24:59.600 --> 25:01.955
Yeah, he's Geronimo Fat.
Now get out of here.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.036
Hey, no, don't go! Don't leave!

25:06.240 --> 25:09.676
He's going to try to put a plunger
in my ass! What you doing, man?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.239
Don't go anywhere.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.632
Let's see if you have this shit
when you get back out here!

25:18.840 --> 25:20.273
Satisfied?

25:21.480 --> 25:22.435
How much?

25:22.600 --> 25:25.319
How about 25?
With a cut here, a cut there...

25:25.680 --> 25:29.070
...it'll double your money easily.
Quickest quarter mil you'll ever make.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.435
I need major weight. I need it yesterday.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.750
I really don't want to see any more of this.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.957
- Give me a ballpark figure.
- Anywhere in the seven figures.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.998
<i>Yo, it's Five-O! It's a setup! Get out!</i>

26:40.280 --> 26:42.157
Well, I guess the grill was optional.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.435
You have the right
to remain silent, asshole.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.511
Take a look in my back pocket, cop.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.915
You think you can buy your way
out of this?

26:55.240 --> 26:58.073
You just ruined three months
of undercover work.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.991
Think of the promotion you're gonna get.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.672
Come on, let's go. Move.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.959
- What are you doing?
- I'm already in the intersection!

27:22.040 --> 27:24.634
Next time you see a cop blow a whistle,
pay attention.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.994
Blow this.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.234
What, are you blind?

27:42.240 --> 27:43.832
Come on!

27:44.680 --> 27:46.432
Where's a cop when you need one?

28:16.840 --> 28:17.750
Fresh meat!

28:19.160 --> 28:20.195
Montini.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.108
Do me at 30.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.432
Go!

28:41.120 --> 28:42.678
Oh, yeah!

28:49.480 --> 28:50.799
Hey, you, Boyd.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.714
No, thanks.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.395
Hey, Serpico.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.793
Afraid of a little pain?

29:01.960 --> 29:03.632
No, I'm just trying to quit.

29:03.720 --> 29:06.109
Maybe you're just hiding
a wire under your shirt.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.476
- Think I'm a plant after the other night?
- Maybe that was your cover.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.632
Who knows? I.A.'s tried everything else
to slip a mole in here.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.959
Go for it.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.712
Go easy on the first time.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.558
Give him twenty-five.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.078
Twenty-five, my ass!

30:02.280 --> 30:05.477
The bad guys are out there. Not in here.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.148
Give me my money!

30:14.680 --> 30:16.477
See you making friends fast.

30:19.960 --> 30:23.953
Just take some deep breaths, in and out.
How do you feel?

30:24.040 --> 30:25.155
Electrified.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.515
Yeah, you'll be all right.
It's just a hazing thing.

30:30.040 --> 30:34.158
Everybody goes through it.
Welcome to the one-five.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.319
- Orin Boyd?
- Yeah.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.431
- You're from the two-one, right?
- Yeah.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.715
They said you're coming. I'm George Clark.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.358
Nice to meet you, George.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.110
I mean, you know,
you're like a legend, man.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.794
I used to read about you
in some new caper every week.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.075
- Don't believe everything you read.
- I don't.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.230
But there was one I was curious about.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.788
You really beat a suspect
unconscious with a dead cat?

31:01.880 --> 31:02.869
No.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.675
Cat wasn't dead.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.872
All right. That's funny.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.390
Cop who came in to break it up,
who was that?

31:10.480 --> 31:12.516
Strutt. Sergeant Lewis Strutt.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.718
He's a good man, a fair man.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.954
Listen, don't worry about Montini.
Shit happens.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.957
Who was Montini trying to set up?

31:20.680 --> 31:22.432
That would be Latrell Walker.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.717
Why you ask? You going after him?

31:35.840 --> 31:37.159
Hey, how you doing?

31:37.920 --> 31:39.069
What do you need?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.993
I need to see the log book
for the last couple of nights.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.872
- Here.
- Thanks.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.392
Who or what are you looking for?

31:51.480 --> 31:54.074
Just some shit bird
who thinks he got away clean.

31:56.520 --> 32:00.035
Can you run a check for it?
All I have is a name, Latrell. Black male.

32:00.120 --> 32:03.271
This isn't the Hall of Records.
Check records downtown.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.395
Thanks a lot.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.119
Happy to help you.

32:59.720 --> 33:02.792
I'm the janitor.
My daughter, Maria, is in the office.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.909
Stay down.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.391
I'm one of the good guys. Come here.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.672
Freeze! Don't move!

34:12.320 --> 34:13.309
I'm a cop.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.795
Bruce, get it out of the way.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.835
Can I get you guys in this area over here?

34:35.639 --> 34:38.473
Keep it back.
Sorry, people, you'll have to stand back.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.553
Officer Boyd.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.994
What have you got?

34:45.800 --> 34:47.279
Take a look at this.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.752
This was taken a few minutes ago
at the police evidence locker.

34:50.840 --> 34:55.550
They keep large quantities of narcotics
here at Piper Tech's main vault.

34:55.639 --> 34:59.599
Yeah, there were six guys. They wore
masks, and their voices were altered.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.919
How much did they take?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.513
About 50 kilos of heroin.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.277
Wait. Can you rewind that bit?

35:16.400 --> 35:18.197
- Freeze on that guy.
- You got it.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.677
Now, can you zoom in right there?

35:20.760 --> 35:23.274
<i>What do you think this is?
Monday Night Football?</i>

35:23.360 --> 35:26.272
Best I can do is 50 percent.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.119
What do you think?

35:29.200 --> 35:31.077
- Rolex?
- It's a TAG.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.994
Height, I'd say about 5'10''?

35:34.200 --> 35:35.235
I'd say so.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.953
And he's black.

35:39.040 --> 35:39.995
Hey, guys.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.392
Hey, look who's here.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.079
- Hey, Montini.
- What's up?

35:44.160 --> 35:47.516
Just giving Officer Boyd here a preview
of the playback from security.

35:47.600 --> 35:52.151
Boyd. What are you doing here?
Whose case did you screw up this time?

35:52.880 --> 35:56.031
You guys mind giving us
a moment to ourselves?

35:56.240 --> 35:58.071
We have some catching up to do.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.836
I'm just fucking with you.
No hard feelings about the other night.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.309
Straight up,
I would have done the same thing.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.074
- So what happened here?
- Property vault was hit.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.071
Fifty kilos of heroin stolen.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.149
Shit, someone's having a big party tonight.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.277
- What, professional hit?
- I don't think pros would be so sloppy.

36:23.280 --> 36:27.398
Probably right. I'm going to head up.
You get wind of anything, let me know.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.749
All right.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.269
What the hell were you doing
at Piper Tech?

36:37.560 --> 36:40.120
Last time I checked,
this was the men's locker room.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.479
Answer the question, Boyd.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.308
I was driving by and I heard the call.

36:47.480 --> 36:51.519
I told you,
I don't tolerate Ione wolf behavior.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.556
You got a problem, you come to me.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.392
It's my only problem.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.350
All right. I'll tell you what. You're back.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.433
But you're walking the beat. And I'm not
letting you out without a leash.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.509
Hey, George.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.114
Stop robbing the vending machine.
Come over here.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.474
And I want to know every move
you make out there...

37:22.840 --> 37:25.832
...or I will have you typing out
reports till your retirement.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.115
That damn machine ate my quarters again.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.833
- Fifth time.
- Whatever.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.070
George, meet your new partner here.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.394
New partner? You mean the two of us?

37:35.480 --> 37:37.152
You make a nice couple.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.035
It's me, George.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.838
- Okay?
- What are you doing here?

37:53.040 --> 37:55.474
Making a mistake picking you up for work.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.073
Nice place you got here.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.234
<i>Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to Detroit A.M.</i>

38:00.320 --> 38:01.673
<i>I'm your host...</i>

38:02.120 --> 38:03.872
<i>...Henry Wayne.
- I love this guy.</i>

38:03.960 --> 38:05.757
<i>Today, we'll face your worst fears.</i>

38:05.840 --> 38:07.796
<i>- What really ticks you off?
- Henry!</i>

38:08.040 --> 38:11.635
<i>When I'm on the freeway, stuck behind
some idiot going 55 in the fast lane.</i>

38:11.800 --> 38:13.950
<i>- He gets a little carried away.
- What did I do?</i>

38:14.040 --> 38:15.951
<i>Did I casually flip him the bird?</i>

38:16.440 --> 38:19.637
<i>Or did I fantasize
about running them off the road...</i>

38:19.720 --> 38:21.676
<i>... and cutting their freaking head off?</i>

38:21.760 --> 38:23.512
So we got a twelve-block stretch.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.797
I like to cruise once or twice,
let the people know we're out here.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.518
Then we can walk it on foot.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.273
I grew up in this area, man.
Now look at it.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.318
Thugs turned it into shit.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.797
Slowly getting a handle on it though.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.515
Might turn this place around after all.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.634
- You married, George?
- Five years next month.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.352
Beautiful woman.
Stuck by me through a lot of shit.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.070
Got a 14-month-old boy.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.275
What about you?

38:50.760 --> 38:54.196
Same old cliché. I guess she got tired
of all those sleepless nights.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.914
Tell me about Montini.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.390
He's a bully. Been in four shootings.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.034
He's still standing. Figure that out.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.999
Hangs out with that mountain man,
Useldinger.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.232
What's the story with him?

39:09.040 --> 39:12.635
Strong as an ox. Got the I.Q. of a handball.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.668
He was a police officer down south,
spent a year undercover in the KKK.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.395
Wound up taking down a cell
all by himself. That guy's an animal.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.392
Good thing Strutt came in...

39:22.800 --> 39:25.109
...because he knows
we're all on the same team.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.519
- What's the story with Strutt?
- He knows everyone.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.718
Need some extra cash,
he can get you a security gig.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.189
Tickets to the Red Wings,
he can make it happen.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.875
Anything you want. He's the ultimate
concierge. A tough bastard, too.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.114
Sometimes, on duty,
he doesn't wear his gun.

39:42.320 --> 39:46.029
Once pulled a rabid Doberman off this boy
and killed it with his bare hands.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.678
So, you got a thing for Mulcahy, or what?

39:50.560 --> 39:54.155
- I saw the way she was eyeing you.
- How long has she been your commander?

39:54.240 --> 39:57.516
About a year now.
And she did a stint over at I.A.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.551
Cleaned up a lot of precincts, too.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.676
Left I.A. to come over to the 15th.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.955
What do you see?

40:07.680 --> 40:08.874
That yellow Hummer.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.788
I know.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.918
I'm barely making ends meet
and that's that fool's fifth car.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.718
- Who?
- His name's T.K.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.672
He owns a club called The Static.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.430
Hey!

40:38.640 --> 40:42.394
I need to see a little bit more green
than that, baby. Come on, put it on.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.435
I like color.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.273
Yeah. Put it on.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.272
That's it. Squeeze it on.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.912
There you go. Hey, baby.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.233
Put them on the glass.

40:55.760 --> 40:58.399
Them some titties.
Them titties for you all!

40:59.240 --> 41:00.753
That's for you.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.870
What's going on, Joe?
Everything cool? All right.

41:06.320 --> 41:09.596
How's the crowd tonight, man?
All right. See you upstairs.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.270
Yo, what's up, dog. All right, man.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.955
He's here. Bring the truck around back.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.072
- Why you looking for him?
- Because I want my grill back.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.749
Yeah, tell them keep shaking that ass!

41:51.280 --> 41:53.191
Look at Rockefeller here. What is it?

41:53.280 --> 41:55.555
Too rich to count the money
the old-fashioned way?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.119
Close the door, man.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.193
Sitting behind my desk in my office
at my club...

42:01.280 --> 42:03.191
...and you want me to close my door?

42:05.840 --> 42:06.909
You paid for it.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.395
- Look like you need a drink.
- Yeah!

42:14.600 --> 42:16.556
You think this deal won't go through?

42:16.640 --> 42:17.834
T, come on, man.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.715
All right.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.233
I'll get that drink for you.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.314
Boss.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.833
T, come here for a minute.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.435
What's up, dog?

42:39.640 --> 42:41.358
Where would I be without you, dog?

42:46.600 --> 42:48.352
All by your motherfucking self.

42:49.640 --> 42:50.595
You right.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.675
Now, get my drink, bitch!

42:57.680 --> 42:59.238
Nigger, I got your bitch.

42:59.400 --> 43:03.188
We have an open mike tonight. Come
downstairs and tell some of them jokes.

43:03.600 --> 43:07.354
I said, I want to see asses shaking! Damn!

43:18.440 --> 43:20.271
Baby, can I have a Hennessy Paradis?

43:20.360 --> 43:22.078
Sure, T. We still on for tonight?

43:22.280 --> 43:24.157
Sorry. I can't make that tonight.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.999
But I promise. I'll make it up to you.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.998
Why'd you even make plans with me?

43:30.920 --> 43:33.753
I just need a couple more days
to work some shit out.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.478
After that, I'm yours.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.279
Shit. By the end of the night,
you just might...

43:39.560 --> 43:40.788
Fuck me!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.279
Dang! Now you talking.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.195
Shit!

43:52.920 --> 43:54.592
What's up, man? What's up?

43:55.560 --> 43:58.154
What's the matter?
You couldn't get in the VIP room?

43:58.680 --> 44:00.432
Have a drink, motherfucker.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.392
Say hello to my sumo Negro.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.270
He about to turn your ass into sashimi.

44:24.280 --> 44:26.157
You in trouble now, sucker.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.434
You aren't doing shit. Get his ass!

44:55.880 --> 44:57.996
There you go, Joe! Kick his ass.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.349
Shit.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.118
Get out of my way! Move!

45:34.600 --> 45:36.033
Freeze! Police!

45:37.080 --> 45:38.479
Put the briefcase down.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.229
Hands in the air.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.474
Up against the wall.

45:50.520 --> 45:52.272
Keep them against the wall.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.838
Got anything in your pocket?

46:00.560 --> 46:02.278
What's this? Don't move.

46:04.160 --> 46:05.434
Got a permit for this?

46:32.680 --> 46:34.830
Come on! Grab the gun! Let's roll!

46:38.840 --> 46:39.875
Oh, shit!

46:42.520 --> 46:45.796
Shit! I'm fucking up my Versace shit!

46:46.000 --> 46:48.275
Come on, dog. Pull me through. Shit!

46:55.240 --> 46:56.753
What are we doing, Boyd?

46:57.320 --> 46:59.072
What are we fucking doing, man?

46:59.440 --> 47:01.795
Either we call backup, or get out of here.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.032
What backup? We ain't here.

47:04.120 --> 47:07.078
Would you answer my question?
I almost fucking died tonight.

47:07.720 --> 47:09.392
Sit down before you fall down.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.750
How are you doing? Come sit down.

47:37.880 --> 47:40.758
- And you are?
- Officer Boyd. I've a few questions for you.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.471
Before you even get into all that...

47:43.640 --> 47:46.393
...you shouldn't be asking me.
I don't know nothing.

47:46.480 --> 47:49.711
Let's start with something simple,
like who is Latrell Walker?

47:50.520 --> 47:51.919
Never heard of him.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.468
Says in here he visited you
a number of times.

47:54.560 --> 47:56.118
Is he a friend of yours?

47:56.200 --> 47:57.872
Said I'd never heard of him.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.032
Are you deaf or something?

48:00.240 --> 48:03.038
No, I'm persistent.
I ran a check on this guy.

48:03.240 --> 48:06.118
Came up empty.
Guy's clean, like a little too clean.

48:06.200 --> 48:08.430
No warrants, no accidents,
no parking tickets.

48:08.520 --> 48:11.557
It's like the guy was born yesterday,
and that makes me nervous.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.789
Your point is?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.798
I want to know
what your relationship is with him.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.519
Did he take over your business
when you went away?

48:18.600 --> 48:20.477
I don't know what you talking about.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.437
Is it meth? Is it coke? What is it?

48:25.080 --> 48:28.595
It was heroin. Thought you knew that.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.592
I know it say it right there. Come on, man.

48:31.680 --> 48:34.069
The cops swear
you all know everything, man.

48:34.680 --> 48:35.635
Know what, man?

48:36.240 --> 48:38.356
You didn't learn nothing in juvie, did you?

48:38.440 --> 48:41.113
Supposed to teach you not to piss
your life away...

48:41.200 --> 48:42.599
...but you keep running back.

48:42.680 --> 48:44.477
That's real clever. You know?

48:44.560 --> 48:47.028
You ain't got a clue what's going on.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.995
Your eyes is glued the fuck shut.

48:50.840 --> 48:51.636
Pig.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.434
You wanna do 10 years in here?
That's your business.

48:54.520 --> 48:58.069
If I were you,
I'd be grabbing for every lifeline tossed out.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.474
Know what I'm saying?

49:02.120 --> 49:03.633
You can't help me, man.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.313
Can't help me at all.

49:14.120 --> 49:18.716
You cannot put Tiger Woods
in the same league as Michael Jordan.

49:18.920 --> 49:21.070
You don't have to be in shape to play golf.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.390
You walk everywhere for Christ's sakes.

49:23.640 --> 49:26.279
But Woods bench presses
damn near 300 pounds.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.999
Well, unless he bench presses my dick...

49:29.200 --> 49:31.668
...I'm really not impressed,
to tell you the truth.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.838
- I'd say Wayne Gretzky's the best.
- You freaking Canadians.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.958
You worship the guy.
You'd crucify the mother, ay?

49:38.160 --> 49:39.275
Whatever, Dinger.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.799
I got one. Babe Ruth.

49:41.880 --> 49:42.869
- Baseball?
- Who?

49:43.080 --> 49:45.719
Fall asleep during the action.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.996
Don't knock baseball. That's un-American.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.638
Wake me up when it's over.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.472
Come on, guys. Come on.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.792
The greatest athlete without a doubt
was Muhammad Ali.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.677
He could defeat you with his mind.

49:56.840 --> 50:00.355
He would never have to put a finger
on you, and have you psyched out.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.992
- To The Greatest.
- To The Greatest.

50:06.040 --> 50:06.995
Hey.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.675
How's your head?

50:11.880 --> 50:14.678
Head is fine.
It's my pride that's still hurting.

50:14.760 --> 50:15.954
Question for you.

50:16.040 --> 50:19.555
Six months ago, there was a bust.
A kid named Shaun Rollins. Remember?

50:19.640 --> 50:22.598
- Yeah, vaguely. Why?
- Anything suspicious about that arrest?

50:22.680 --> 50:24.875
Far as I can remember, it was clean.

50:25.080 --> 50:28.675
Montini always pays attention to detail
when he types those things up.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.228
- Montini was the arresting officer?
- Yeah. Why?

50:31.320 --> 50:34.198
Where could I find him?
To put two and two together...

50:34.280 --> 50:35.235
...even things up.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.548
Relax.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.995
- What the fuck you doing?
- Shut up. Hands down.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.670
- What are you doing?
- Why you pressing me?

51:02.840 --> 51:05.229
- Who's pressing you?
- You got a cop on my ass.

51:05.400 --> 51:06.992
Same guy from the other night.

51:07.080 --> 51:10.117
He's a Neanderthal. He keeps popping up
all over the place.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.312
He's not one of ours.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.751
I'll take care of him. But what
were you thinking, showing up here?

51:16.840 --> 51:18.751
I should just shoot you in case...

51:19.400 --> 51:21.311
Look, if I wanted to bust you, man...

51:21.400 --> 51:24.676
...I'd have brought you in a long time ago.
This is business.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.718
I just got a shitload of product
for our next deal.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.878
- Forget it.
- How much?

51:37.640 --> 51:38.868
Around $5 million.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.029
Yeah, right.

51:40.240 --> 51:43.038
You wanted seven figures,
that's what I brought, right?

51:43.880 --> 51:46.110
If not, then we do have a big problem.

51:46.360 --> 51:50.558
$5 million? It'll get me locked up
until I'm eligible for social security.

51:50.760 --> 51:54.036
I don't need social security, asshole.
I need police security.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.670
So before we do any more business...

51:57.480 --> 51:59.835
...you let me know
you got shit under control.

52:00.880 --> 52:01.835
All right.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.478
Would it ease your worries
if I showed you our operation?

52:07.720 --> 52:09.153
Fucking right.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.789
Fine.

52:12.280 --> 52:15.716
We'll call you when we're ready.
You just have the money together.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.316
Done.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.194
Really, Henry.
Right after group and everything.

52:39.480 --> 52:40.674
Boyd? Shit!

52:41.840 --> 52:43.558
I just came in to use the phone.

52:43.640 --> 52:45.596
Relax, man. I just need a favor.

52:45.680 --> 52:48.478
Ladies, would you let me talk
to my friend for a minute?

52:50.000 --> 52:54.039
Anything. You need me to go undercover?
I'm like a chameleon.

52:54.120 --> 52:57.715
It also looks like you're kicking
a lot of big ass there. How many guys?

52:57.800 --> 53:00.439
Two, but they were huge.
They were meat packers.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.117
I could've used some of your moves.
Maybe you could teach me.

53:04.200 --> 53:07.829
Later. You know that exposé you did
on the Mob a few years ago?

53:09.040 --> 53:10.758
How'd you get that intel?

53:10.960 --> 53:14.839
I can be resourceful. Plus, I work
with the I Team, a group of former PI's...

53:14.920 --> 53:18.356
...who owe us their licenses
due to various felony convictions.

53:18.440 --> 53:21.955
I need you to find out whatever you can
about a guy called Latrell Walker.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.951
His identity seems to be a total scam.

53:24.240 --> 53:27.869
And also what his connection is
with a guy called Shaun Rollins. Can you?

53:27.960 --> 53:30.997
I'll see what I can dig up.
Why'd you come to me?

53:31.240 --> 53:33.196
I don't want to attract any attention.

53:33.280 --> 53:35.840
And I think your peculiar methods
might work for me.

53:35.920 --> 53:38.070
- What's this all about?
- It might be nothing.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.799
It might be something.
If it's big, it's really big.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.474
I just got to see
how high up this shit goes.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.079
Don't screw this one up.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.879
I won't,
because I've seen you when you're angry.

53:48.080 --> 53:49.479
All right, ladies?

53:49.680 --> 53:50.669
Come to papa.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.592
- You want in on this?
- No.

53:54.640 --> 53:56.312
I just want to make a toast.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.756
This is to us
finally getting together for dinner.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.718
But I just have one request.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.714
I'm listening.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.035
No police talk.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.398
No mentioning the latest homicide
or gang shooting.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.475
Tonight, just happy thoughts. Agreed?

54:12.680 --> 54:14.989
Agreed. To happy thoughts.

54:17.440 --> 54:18.839
Good evening, Commander.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.592
What're you doing here, Boyd?

54:22.680 --> 54:25.319
- You wanted to see me.
- In my office, not here.

54:25.400 --> 54:27.231
But I'm here now. So let's talk.

54:27.320 --> 54:30.039
I'm sorry,
but we were actually right in the middle.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.119
Why don't you take a walk?

54:33.320 --> 54:36.118
It's okay. Just give us five minutes.

54:38.960 --> 54:40.871
I had to go to the men's room anyway.

54:45.040 --> 54:47.873
- How'd you find me?
- What are you doing with this guy?

54:47.960 --> 54:50.235
That is none of your business.

54:50.440 --> 54:53.671
- He doesn't look right for you.
- And you do?

54:54.800 --> 54:56.870
What did you want to talk to me about?

54:56.960 --> 54:58.632
Why'd you visit Shaun Rollins?

54:58.720 --> 55:01.951
- The walls have ears.
- I know everything, Boyd.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.912
So, why am I here?

55:04.120 --> 55:06.509
I don't have time for games.
What are you up to?

55:07.480 --> 55:10.199
- You used to work for Internal Affairs.
- Yeah.

55:10.320 --> 55:14.233
Out of all the people around you,
how'd you know who you could trust?

55:14.840 --> 55:16.319
Why? What have you got?

55:16.400 --> 55:20.075
I can't say yet. Not till I have more proof.
What have you got?

55:20.520 --> 55:23.796
Let's just say my instincts tell me
something's not quite right.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.913
Bring me something solid.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.433
I have something solid.

55:28.880 --> 55:29.869
More solid.

55:30.560 --> 55:33.950
- Then I'll know what to do with it.
- You'll know what to do with it?

55:35.520 --> 55:36.794
- Carmine?
- Good.

55:38.440 --> 55:40.749
Not bad. I'll see you on campus.

55:50.720 --> 55:51.755
Watch your back.

56:15.600 --> 56:17.352
Hey, Clark. What's going on?

56:17.560 --> 56:19.516
Six. Nothing much.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.518
I hear you're working with Supercop now.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.108
What's that like?

56:24.200 --> 56:26.589
Hey, George.
Which one are you? Starsky or Hutch?

56:27.840 --> 56:28.909
Don't mind him.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.395
I don't.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.275
Heard about that scuffle.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.670
What were you doing
at The Static anyway?

56:37.960 --> 56:39.916
Orin wanted to question the owner, T.K.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.435
About what?

56:42.240 --> 56:43.468
They never spoke.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.796
Boyd's trying to steal my bust, George.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.434
He's a glory hound.
We've seen this kind before.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.352
What else did you find out?

56:50.440 --> 56:52.795
Nothing. We searched his office,
came up empty.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.314
I wish you would have called
the point detective.

56:55.400 --> 56:56.913
I would've found something.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.754
We did find a visitor's pass from County.
Don't worry, Montini.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.876
We'll let you know what we come up with.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.238
You guys done with the bench?

57:09.640 --> 57:11.153
Yeah, go ahead.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.673
Hey, you know, Montini?

57:12.760 --> 57:15.672
If all you come down here
to do is work out your mouth...

57:15.880 --> 57:18.519
...maybe you should move on.
Breaks our concentration.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.190
Find out who they visited up at County.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.430
Yeah, don't worry about that, I'm on it.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.834
You come with me.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.558
Be back in an hour.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.078
Ready to meet the wizard?

58:19.280 --> 58:20.599
Put it on.

58:24.360 --> 58:26.510
You don't need to know where we're going.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.793
<i>Welcome to the inner sanctum, Mr. Walker.</i>

58:34.280 --> 58:35.633
I always wanted to do that.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.148
I wish I had a cat.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.719
Heard a lot about you.

58:38.800 --> 58:40.313
Wish I could say the same.

58:41.080 --> 58:43.071
Like the saying goes:

58:43.400 --> 58:47.632
''The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convince the world he didn't exist.''

58:48.640 --> 58:50.198
Let me show you around.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.836
I don't get it. T-shirts?

59:17.040 --> 59:19.474
Amazing what you can do
with the right chemicals.

59:19.560 --> 59:22.677
Your connections are all over the country,
this is our plan...

59:22.760 --> 59:24.591
...to get the heroin out of state.

59:24.680 --> 59:27.319
No risky exposure, no trail back to us.

59:27.400 --> 59:30.631
These T-shirts are dipped
in a heroin solution...

59:31.400 --> 59:33.630
...and dried under these lamps.

59:34.080 --> 59:36.389
They're folded and sealed in shrink-wrap.

59:37.640 --> 59:39.232
Dogs can't even smell it.

59:39.400 --> 59:41.231
You can send them anywhere you want.

59:41.320 --> 59:42.753
Extract the heroin later.

59:43.560 --> 59:44.629
You in?

59:47.720 --> 59:48.675
Yeah, I'm in.

59:50.560 --> 59:52.073
Pick you up at midnight.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.390
Me and the I Team came up
with some fascinating intel.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.915
Latrell Walker's whole I.D.'s fake.
He's a shell.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.116
He paid a lot too. He's got everything.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.714
Driver's license, birth certificate,
credit cards.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.995
He's even got a voter's registration card.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.640
Normal investigation
wouldn't have uncovered this...

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.838
...but one of our dudes worked for the IRS,
and can computer-dissect anybody.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.273
Who is he, then?

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.152
He's Shaun Rollins' brother.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.469
Listen to this.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.189
<i>About six months ago,
Latrell's little brother, Shaun, gets popped.</i>

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.989
<i>He claims the heroin was planted,
but the cops made the charges stick.</i>

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.514
<i>Next thing you know,
Latrell's back in town.</i>

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.272
<i>That's why he was visiting him.</i>

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.592
<i>My sources ran a check on Shaun also,
and he's set for life financially.</i>

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.999
<i>How? From who?</i>

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.999
<i>He has a trust fund
set up in his name for millions...</i>

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.071
<i>... but he can't touch it until he's 25.</i>

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.435
<i>- Who set it up for him?
- I'm getting to that.</i>

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.149
<i>Shaun also has another brother, Leon.
Or so I thought.</i>

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.835
<i>Now, Leon Rollins and Latrell Walker
are the same person.</i>

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.114
<i>You're shitting me.</i>

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.430
<i>Leon's also a gazillionaire.</i>

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.151
<i>How can a guy with no record
make so much money dealing heroin?</i>

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.629
<i>No, no. The guy's a computer wiz.</i>

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.355
<i>Started up a dot com out of Virginia
called $9.99 Dot Com.</i>

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.192
<i>"Anything you want under $10."</i>

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.512
<i>And he did great. Lucky bastard
cashed out just before the bubble burst.</i>

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.116
<i>Maybe Latrell's buying heroin,
and seeking distributors on the Internet.</i>

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.196
Welcome to the Computer Age, my friend.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.392
No street involvement,
no watching out for cops, no risk.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.913
It's brilliant, isn't it?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.158
It still doesn't add up
unless they have some big debts.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.710
Well, here's all the paperwork.
I got IPO statements, tax returns.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.712
I got his address
from a crooked car dealer we investigated.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.268
I don't know if it will help, but I did my job.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.228
You did good, man.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.236
Thanks, partner.

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.434
Let's go. Smash it!

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.473
Let's move it!

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.109
Montini, Useldinger...

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.713
...what a surprise.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.679
This to make me talk?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.432
No, it's to make you die.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.478
It's from Latrell.
He made us an offer we couldn't refuse.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.635
Look out!

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.119
Shoot him!

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.995
You don't have the balls to kill me yourself.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.310
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.715
- I know everything about you.
- About time.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.472
But why would I want you dead?

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.472
Because I'm that close to locking you up
with your brother.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.111
You want to see what's really going on?

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.035
Come on.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.114
It's all right, it's all right. Chill.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.633
This is my operation.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.676
- What's up, man?
- Yeah, it's all right.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.991
I believe you two have already met.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.357
What the hell're you doing here?

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.192
You want another ass-whupping?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.955
I'm joking. I got your grill downstairs.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.036
I can send somebody to get it if you want.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.076
Come, I want to show you something.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.274
All right.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.550
You.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.715
Good memory.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.717
This is Trish, my guardian angel.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.908
- She's helping out with the project.
- What project?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.834
See, a lot of people talk about
police corruption, but no one ever sees it.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.637
I figured I'd be the one to show it to them,
over the Internet.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.034
Have a seat.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.196
<i>- How much?
- How about 25?</i>

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.992
<i>With a cut here, a cut there...</i>

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.755
<i>... it'll double your money easily.
Quickest quarter mil you'll ever make.</i>

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.315
<i>I need major weight. I need it yesterday.</i>

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.750
We've been tracking
their activity for months.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.952
I'm compiling the video
on our digital editing system.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.155
<i>You come with me.</i>

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.389
<i>Be back in an hour.</i>

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.836
When we have enough evidence,
we'll show it to the authorities.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.873
If that doesn't work,
we'll post the video on our website.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.551
<i>Why you pressing me?</i>

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.197
<i>Look, if I wanted to bust you, man,
I'd have brought you in a long time ago.</i>

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:26.188
<i>This is business. I just got a shitload
of product for our next deal.</i>

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.719
Incriminating shit.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.269
They think I'm a buyer from the
West Coast looking to score major weight.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:33.714
They raised it, too.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.395
I don't know how, but they managed
to get $5 million worth of shit.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.835
Piper Tech.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:40.469
Run number 8.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.591
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.599
<i>Welcome to the inner sanctum, Mr. Walker.</i>

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.432
<i>I always wanted to do that.</i>

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.352
You didn't know he was in on it?

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:56.399
<i>"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convince the world he didn't exist."</i>

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.518
Where'd you guys get this stuff?

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.113
From everywhere. Check it out.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.593
This is our stuff.
We have cameras hidden in everything.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.152
Watches, batteries, purses. You name it.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.792
This is a little camera that can be hidden
everywhere and can see everything.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.912
And you're the star of a few of these
as well.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.193
<i>Come on, let me go.</i>

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.395
<i>Shit, man!</i>

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.394
<i>Come on!</i>

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.993
Lucky move.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.394
Unlucky face.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.031
T, get us something to drink.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:35.670
<i>Just because I own a bar don't mean
I'm Isaac from The Love Boat.</i>

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.393
A Hennessy Paradis, please.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.676
Yes, master.
Should I get some for Mr. Charlie, too?

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.428
What do you think?

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.475
I think we need to take them down now.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.870
Not yet. I want to catch
all these guys at once. Stick it to them.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.551
I won't wait. They tried to kill me.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.552
I won't let you ruin this.
My brother's ass is on the line.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.153
What's he got to do with it?

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.238
Your buddies wanted
their own drug dealer on the street.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.756
Rather than lose him, they framed Shaun.
I got to get him out of jail.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.710
I made my father a promise before he died.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.350
That I'd always be my brother's keeper.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.754
I keep my promises.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.470
Where'd you promise to meet these boys?

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.632
Frederick's Cleaners.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.834
After midnight.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.115
I'll need a car.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.028
Give him the keys.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.593
T, the keys.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.829
Come on, man.
My mama don't even drive my car.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.353
Give him the keys.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.159
You scratch it, you buy it.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.030
Nice inconspicuous car you got there.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.514
Thank you.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.988
What'd you find out?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.798
Piper Tech was hit by cops.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.394
- Cops?
- Yeah.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:28.995
Come on, Boyd.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.437
Strutt, Useldinger, Montini,
they're all dirty.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.392
Are you positive?
What proof do you have?

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.435
Start the car.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.393
Get the car! Let's go!

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.032
- Is that proof enough?
- Yeah.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.229
Now move.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.797
Step on it. We got him.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.796
Come on!

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.356
- There he is.
- Pop him now!

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.275
Shit!

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.835
Hold on!

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.108
- I always said women are bad drivers.
- I agree.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.272
- There he is!
- Yeah.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.071
Get up on them!

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.676
Shit!

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.511
Shit! Goddamn!

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.711
Get out of the way!

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.232
Get out of the way!

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.913
- Go right.
- Going left.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.515
Get up to him!

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.279
Shoot him!

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.389
Damn!

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.952
Hey, my bike!

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.511
I got a date tonight!

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.074
Move!

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.758
Get out of the way!

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.714
Go around!

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.310
Oh, shit!

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.073
Push it through!

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.556
Fucker.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.235
Look out!

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.834
Just get it off! Just get it off!

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.989
There!

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.394
Get the fuck off...

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.151
<i>- This better be good.
- Frank, I'm in hell.</i>

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.230
What happened?
There's an APB out on you.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.710
Mulcahy's dead, you fled the scene.
They're pinning Piper Tech on you.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.837
Strutt and Montini.
They're behind everything.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.554
<i>- How do you know that?
- Because they tried to kill me.</i>

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.949
<i>- Look...
- Frank, you've known me for a long time.</i>

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.678
Have I ever lied to you?

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.359
What do you want me to do?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.351
You said I never think before I act.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.398
Well, I'm thinking now.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.719
I need backup.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.911
There's a deal to go down in an hour.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.639
<i>Strutt's selling the heroin he stole
from Piper Tech.</i>

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.914
I'll get some men.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.949
Strutt? What the hell
are you talking about?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.999
I understand if you don't believe me. You
said you wanted to clean up the streets.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.229
Here's your chance.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.239
Give me the baby, honey.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.479
You take over.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.390
Let's do it.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.119
Right on time.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.870
Punctuality is the soul of good business.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.309
I like that.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.119
Check it out if you want.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.715
Frank.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.759
Christ, Orin.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.474
Did you bring anybody?

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.318
I don't know who we can trust.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.875
I want you to put this on.
You'll need all the protection you can get.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.313
Let me hold that for you.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.956
I haven't worn one of these in years.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.634
Tastes like candy.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.318
As you can see, we kept our end.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.594
Now it's your turn.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.154
Is that the money?

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.429
Half.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.109
$2.5 million.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.828
Deal wasn't for half.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.553
I'm just covering my ass.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.438
You'll get the rest as soon as
we leave in one piece.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.669
You have my word.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.318
Your word is not good enough.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.958
Looks like we have a problem.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.792
You'll get your money.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.916
You got to be sensitive to my situation.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.638
Half's better than nothing.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.072
Hold up. Now, listen.
Nobody's trying to fuck anybody here.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.119
I think you are, Leon.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.875
- What?
- What was you thinking?

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.632
Where are you going with this?

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.075
I thought you was smarter than this.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.109
So did I, Strutt.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.113
Move.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.791
If it isn't Hou-motherfucking-dini.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.190
Escaped so many traps,
should be wearing a cape.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.868
I thought you said
you had this animal on a leash.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.196
You assholes couldn't keep
your shit together.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.111
I guess I picked the wrong precinct.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.236
Look around you. You picked the right.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.833
Then finish the job.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.353
Nice friends you got, Boyd.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.597
Don't give me that look.
I've been on the force too long.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.910
Laying my life on the line, and for what?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.433
A lousy $40,000 a year?

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.874
The hell with that!

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.032
You have single-handedly
screwed up my operation.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.389
It's our operation.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.755
Let's get it straight. I run this show!

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.990
Not you! Not him! None of you!

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:24.995
Prove it.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.276
Kill him.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.795
Freeze!

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.556
Shit! I'm hit.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.870
This is your big fucking plan?

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.510
Go.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.396
I'll get Strutt. Take care of Montini.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.799
I got that motherfucker.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.754
Don't leave me here!

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.279
I got you covered.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.389
You okay, chief?

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.075
Hell, no!

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.355
Boyd, you okay?

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.677
- I don't know.
- I'll check your vest.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.311
- Didn't go through.
- Good news.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.229
Damn it!

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.195
Fuck!

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.590
Daniels!

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.635
Where you going?

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.319
You're fired!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.435
This is Strutt, ready for pickup.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.034
Go!

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.195
Shake him off!

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.950
You and your brother
can rot in jail together.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.238
Motherfucker!

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.995
You all right?

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.036
You'll be cleaning up the street soon.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.758
Then I'll be reading about you.

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.273
I don't know about that.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.954
Tell them I'm your partner.
They won't let me through!

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.393
Yeah, let him in.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.395
What happened here?
After all we been through?

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.836
We risk our lives, and I hear
about this on the strippers' scanner.

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.796
Shit!

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.110
Smack my mama on her ass!
That's Henry Wayne!

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.519
Can you do a story on me?

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.876
I was in there.
The cops shot me. I got shot 16 times.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.393
Does that hurt?

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.238
Yeah! I'm not faking this shit!

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.995
- Could we film your surgery for the show?
- Yeah, you can film my stuff.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.798
I'm going to be on TV.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.155
- Can my mama come to the studio?
- You know it.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.789
Cool. When you want to do it?
We're going to the hospital now.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.638
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:53.638
- Mr. Boyd. Some good work in there.
- Thank you.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.838
Faster you get rid of dirty cops,
the better for all of us.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.592
Thanks for making a difference.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.875
You want your old job back, at two-one...

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.229
...it's all yours.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.477
No, I think I'll stay here. Right, pard?

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.515
Yeah.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.951
- You know where to reach me.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.672
By the way, Mr. Boyd...

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.833
...I fought in Vietnam.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.673
That don't surprise me.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.078
- Your buddies are on there.
- Heard about your brother Shaun.

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.558
Hopefully, that'll get him out.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.631
Think those tapes'll make a difference?

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.717
Courts don't give a shit about this.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.189
So I had your brother pulled from County.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.355
Just in case.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.235
Thank you.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.673
See you around, partner.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.829
Thanks a lot.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.549
You're welcome.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.835
It's been 30 days since I've been pinched,
punched, scalded or stabbed.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.433
Well, that's something.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.999
I'm not gonna pay strippers
to beat me up anymore.

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.436
I'm living in a safe house on Southgate,
if anyone wants to reach me.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.159
Linda, I'm a changed man
with a lot of problems...

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.037
...so we'll see a lot of each other.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.793
I've signed up for your shame
and impotence class.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.114
And these are for you.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.192
Thank you.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.434
That's super, Henry.

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:34.990
So I'd like to proudly acknowledge
our very own hero, Orin Boyd.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.597
Hey, guys. You need some love. Come on.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.274
Come on. Group hug.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.828
Get in here. Come on, everybody.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.311
We're proud of this man.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.239
Feels good, don't it?

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.030
Where are we going?
You guys got to stay here.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.430
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm honored to introduce my new co-host.</i>

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.870
<i>How about a big hand for T.K. Johnson.</i>

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.238
<i>What's up, White Chocolate?</i>

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.829
<i>- Good to see you too.
- All right.</i>

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.754
<i>We got together
when we filmed your surgery...</i>

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.871
<i>... and I've got to tell you something.</i>

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.157
<i>You had the gown on,
and it slipped up, and I'll tell you...</i>

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.072
<i>... it's not true what they say.</i>

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.589
<i>Do you like to be called a black man?</i>

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.075
<i>Do you like to be called
an African-American?</i>

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.878
<i>I like to be called T.K., baby.</i>

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.870
<i>Don't label me.</i>

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.594
<i>I mean, what, do you prefer ofay...</i>

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.518
<i>... or do you prefer cracker?</i>

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.472
<i>Redneck? Which one do you like?</i>

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.869
<i>- Cracker's good.
- Hi, Mama.</i>

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.552
<i>- She's out there?
- I love you.</i>

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.995
<i>- Your dad watching?
- Yeah, but he got glaucoma.</i>

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.391
<i>He probably home, smoking a joint.
He can hear me.</i>

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.955
<i>- Good.
- Daddy. Save some for me.</i>

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.918
<i>Save some for me.
Remember, puff, puff, pass.</i>

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.278
<i>Puff, puff, pass. He like to hold on
to the weed sometimes. Because he's old.</i>

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.993
<i>- How old is he?
- He's 48.</i>

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.470
<i>Is Tawana backstage?</i>

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.433
<i>- My nipples are sensitive. Yours?
- Yeah. And huge.</i>

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:03.999
<i>I always tell women this:</i>

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.514
<i>"If you want it to be over, lick my nipples."</i>

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.918
<i>I like my nipple to be nibbled on
and bit and pulled. I like a little pain.</i>

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.116
<i>I like it too. Very little.</i>

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.112
<i>But they get out of control
and you don't say, "That hurts."</i>

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.156
<i>- But they are.
- I sort of like it.</i>

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.909
<i>Because I'm black,
you say I got to do a B and E?</i>

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.473
<i>No, no, but...</i>

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.029
<i>I pulled your record
before I came over here, too.</i>

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.031
<i>I know what you used to do.</i>

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.235
<i>And I still do.</i>

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.072
<i>- You been with a big woman?
- I have.</i>

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.195
<i>How was that?</i>

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.714
<i>It was fine.</i>

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.594
<i>But I will say this, they're not jolly.</i>

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.398
<i>- They can be cranky.
- Feed them.</i>

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.994
<i>- Now, you like big women?
- I love big women.</i>

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.719
<i>If you want to feel the heat,
you got to have the meat.</i>

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.710
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.916
<i>A big woman good
in the summer and winter.</i>

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.639
<i>Good for shade in summer
and good for warmth in winter.</i>

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.869
<i>You're not masturbating enough.</i>

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.076
<i>- I masturbate two, three times a day.
- Do you?</i>

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.071
<i>I like to do it at the tanning salon.</i>

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.550
<i>- Cause, you are in there...
- At the tanning salon.</i>

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.278
<i>You probably aren't in there.</i>

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.078
<i>But you got to be careful,
because when you're doing it...</i>

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:09.068
<i>... you can't wear the goggles,
you got to watch the door.</i>

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.272
<i>So you can go blind masturbating actually,
like the old saying.</i>

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.709
<i>Every night, same routine. I get a towel...</i>

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.708
<i>... half damp. On one side, warm water.
Half dry on the other.</i>

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.717
<i>Astroglide. Lesbian porn.</i>

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.119
<i>Second only to nature.</i>

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.112
<i>No dicks allowed, number 67 or 69.</i>

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.153
<i>I don't get in trouble.
Clean up, everything's nice.</i>

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.954
<i>Although you can get that
on the remote control.</i>

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.674
<i>When you do a number two,
do you use a handy wipe?</i>

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:40.589
<i>I wipe, then I take a lot of toilet paper
and dip it in water...</i>

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.433
<i>- In the bowl?
- In a clean bowl.</i>

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.636
<i>- That's what I do.
- And then I wipe my ass.</i>

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.109
<i>We're too old to have shit stains
in our drawers.</i>

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.634
<i>Can't be cool
when you got a big-ass shit stain.</i>

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.995
<i>I've not peed the bed since I quit drinking.</i>

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.833
<i>I won a chugging contest before I quit.</i>

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.229
<i>And I not only peed the bed, I shit the bed.</i>

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:02.199
<i>I was in college. I woke and thought:
"What did my roommate do?"</i>

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.508
<i>And then I went:
"Wait a minute. What did I do?"</i>

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:07.750
<i>If you have a real problem, get Viagra.</i>

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.872
<i>You don't need a problem for that.
You just go and get it.</i>

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.757
<i>They need to get that for women.</i>

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.876
<i>Well, they would call it Niagara then.</i>

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.317
<i>- You watch Oprah?
- Big or small Oprah?</i>

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.039
<i>I never liked small Oprah
because her head is too big.</i>

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.556
<i>Her head too big for that little body.
Then the eye started to droop.</i>

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.519
<i>Looked like E.T.</i>

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.150
<i>- Oprah, stay big.
- Oprah's great.</i>

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.030
