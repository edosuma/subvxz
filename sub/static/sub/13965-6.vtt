Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.588 --> 00:05.544
KHLYEN: Jaqobis was part of
a military experiment.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.462
It seems they took liberties
we were not aware of.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.295
Dutch, it's happening again!

00:10.386 --> 00:12.672
DUTCH: Maybe Kh/yen’s
using the plasma
to connect your minds,

00:12.763 --> 00:14.173
like he did to me
with the neurolink.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.256
Oh, great.
That's super comforting.

00:16.601 --> 00:19.934
A less discrete
person might ask
why a lowborn Killjoy

00:20.021 --> 00:22.888
possesses an instrument
reserved for female royalty.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.608
It came with the ship.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.932

can do me a favor

00:26.110 --> 00:27.350

through the wall.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.994
Still behind
the big ass wall.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.493
I'm gonna have to go up
against a lot of people
to bring it down.

Well, like I said,
lam an excellent wingman.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.139
Huh?

01:07.485 --> 01:09.476
You heard wrong, handsome.
Huh.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.818
Hokk 9's illegal
on this moon.

Westhole's a pile of bricks.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.403

That's just rude.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.846
Hey, dumbass, you didn't read
the whole warrant, did you?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.852
Of course I did.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.100
Sir, you are just
embarrassing yourself.

You hit that tank,
you vaporize Old Town.

Fine, you run after him.
Don't need to.

pass out right about...

the whole warrant.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.225
You're welcome.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.149
I've been
thinking about Pawter.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.271
Really?

02:33.404 --> 02:34.439
Well, her mother,
actually.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.485
The way she
infected herself

02:35.573 --> 02:37.484
to give Pawter information
about that pathogen.

02:37.575 --> 02:38.815
Oh, yeah.
It was horrible.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.616
Well, I think we need
to do the same thing
with this green plasma shit.

02:41.704 --> 02:42.693
Infect ourselves?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.824
They tried doing
that to me on Arkyn.
Didn't take.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.496
I'm not saying
we're gonna shoot up,

02:46.584 --> 02:47.869
but Khlyen said
the plasma is key.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.827
We need to find out
what it does to people,
what it is.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.502
Any idea
where to find some?

not gonna like it.

he's full of plasma.

03:05.811 --> 03:09.144
No, I said itwas like
the plasma the client had.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.358

He likes me.

you make him dance
with your woo-woo powers,

doesn't mean that

Why did I
mind-jack Mossie?

05:08.934 --> 05:11.050
JOHN: I think that's how
the plasma works.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.431
It adapts to whatever
organism it encounters.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.978
It bonds into something new.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.475
That's what they were trying
to do to me on Arkyn?

05:16.609 --> 05:17.644
Get it to bond?

05:17.735 --> 05:19.521
Yeah, and when it bonds,
it changes.

05:19.612 --> 05:22.319
So Mossie goo is only ever
gonna connect to Mossie.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.567
So we need pure plasma.

How?

05:26.410 --> 05:29.277

market for ridiculously
impossible items.

and yet a desire

05:36.253 --> 05:37.629
to be center of attention.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.650
Lucy, hail on all frequencies.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.452

We ’re already being hailed.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.082
Ifyou've been expecting us,

09:46.170 --> 09:48.331
Mr. Romwell, I assume you know
what we've come for.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.831
Ido. (CHUCKLES)
And I’m very excited

09:51.925 --> 09:53.540
to find out what
you’ve brought me
in exchange.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.965
A world of wonders.

09:58.682 --> 10:02.800
Well, the price of admission
to my ship is a trade.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.015
What ship?

10:07.399 --> 10:08.388
Are you game?

10:08.776 --> 10:09.765

10:50.984 --> 10:52.724
Well, this looks familiar.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.436
Hexagonal basalt.
A volcanic planet

10:55.572 --> 10:57.858

a billion years ago.

inside of an asteroid

10:59.535 --> 11:01.571
full of photonic crystals.
Genius.

energy for a lifetime.

Three Killjoys,
and not one
trying to arrest me.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.787
That's new.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.291
DUTCH: We're looking for
a special green plasma.

11:13.549 --> 11:16.131
Yes, I think I have
what you're looking for.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.175
I'm so glad you've come.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.841
I'd almost given up
on finding an interesting
trade in the Quad.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.843
Such a sweaty
little armpit of a place.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.340
No offense.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.272
Welcome to my collection.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.855
Uh, you collect keys?

11:35.946 --> 11:37.106
Here it is.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.939
I couldn't fit everything
into one small asteroid,
so...

11:40.951 --> 11:42.441
A molecular printer?

11:42.911 --> 11:44.287
Amazing, right?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.414
That trade cost me.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.781
But now I scan whatever
I acquire into the system,

11:48.876 --> 11:51.037
and everything's available
at the turn of a key.

Beautiful.

12:08.854 --> 12:09.843
Ah!

(CLICKING, WHIRRING)

12:19.156 --> 12:20.646
Now you don't.

prepare for company.

SAN: Ooh, Captain Apex.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.073
But the Velubian princess
storyline is so derivative.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.249
And this isn't
even a first edition.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.785
Ah...

12:37.257 --> 12:38.588
A Rossi Naz.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.927
She's the premium
knife maker in "The J."

12:41.011 --> 12:42.592
But I have 50

12:42.679 --> 12:44.544
Twenty-two inscribed
to me personally.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.260
What about over here?

12:47.559 --> 12:49.641
I have 50 of these.
Two million of those.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.684
And that issue
of Captain Apex?

12:52.022 --> 12:53.558
Totally a collector's item.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.015
Yeah, and what is up
with his assistants?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.646

an internal scan.

to hack our system?

use them as guard animals.

They're very bitey,
if I remember correctly.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.474
Yeah, you got that right.

of where you got it.

But you can't trade
me what I already had.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.805
Actually, you traded for half
of what you already had.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.727
So this half is mine.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.521
We were trading for
the plasma in the vial.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.688
Should have
been more specific.

wrap Up my box for me.

wrap up your box?

them ifyou give us
the plasma in your collection.

teach me how to charm
the Prince with music

19:18.241 --> 19:19.822

was the liquid
that ran their ships.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.410
I traded for it,
and I left my planet.

gonna make copies of us?

may have screwed around with
your neural link a little bit.

32:29.532 --> 32:31.022
Get on Lucy,
I'll hold them off.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.653
They'll rip the ramp
off your ship to get at you.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.358
And your popguns
certainly won't stop them.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.193
I think I know
something that might.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.613
Hang in there, Lucy.
I got your back.

32:41.502 --> 32:42.491
(CLANGS)

32:46.549 --> 32:48.380
You have the plasma?
Seriously?

32:49.051 --> 32:50.040
(SIGHS)

32:53.889 --> 32:55.971
You found it.
It's what I came for.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.685
D'AVlN: Photonic crystals
produce energy, right?

32:59.103 --> 33:01.560
If I can get
enough speed going,

33:01.647 --> 33:02.853
this thing would make
one hell of a grenade.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.150
DUTCH: (GROANS)
You're using all of it?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.145
D'AVlN:
We've got one shot.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.399
World of wonders.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.439
I'm a wizard.

33:13.993 --> 33:14.982
(BLAST)

33:15.411 --> 33:16.742
I'll take care of them.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.705
(LASER SHOTS RICOCHETING)

33:24.920 --> 33:26.080
Good plan, dumbass!

33:26.714 --> 33:28.955
At that speed, your grenade
is gonna nuke this asteroid.

33:29.258 --> 33:30.373
Let's go.

33:33.262 --> 33:34.422
My collection.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.049
They'rejust things, San.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.425
Your nanites won't heal this.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.053
Time to abandon ship.
Come on.

Almost there, John.

(WHIRRING)
JOHN: Lucy, shoot us out.

33:45.900 --> 33:46.889
LUCY: With pleasure.

(BEEPING)

33:55.534 --> 33:57.115
ETA half an hour.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.031
I'm gonna go
talk to Romwell.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.487
Give him some time.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.865
He just lost
an asteroid ship, Dutch.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.370
An asteroid ship.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.869
(SCOFFS)

34:12.676 --> 34:14.758
Sorry about
using up the plasma.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.546
You saved our lives.
Sort of.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.347
Those powers will
come in handy next time

34:20.434 --> 34:21.719
you rearrange the furniture.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.311
Hey, whatever
Khlyen did to me

34:23.604 --> 34:25.265
it could be
a game-changer.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.939
I could fight Level Sixes,
maybe kill them with that...

(MAKES SHOOTING SOUNDS)

34:31.320 --> 34:32.355

34:32.446 --> 34:34.311
Whatever that thing is.

34:39.203 --> 34:42.320
It's the first time I've felt
really good about myself...

34:42.790 --> 34:44.951
Since all that shit
went down in the Army.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.247
Why don't you take
all that self-esteem

34:49.338 --> 34:52.000
and go visit your
friend in Old Town?

34:52.341 --> 34:53.501
Have some fun.

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

35:00.724 --> 35:01.884

How are you feeling?

35:05.562 --> 35:07.302
Honestly? I, Uh...

35:08.065 --> 35:09.896
I feel free

35:10.651 --> 35:12.562
for the first time
in a very long time.

35:13.654 --> 35:16.487
I forgot what it was like
to be a part of a story.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.359
Thank you for that.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.442
I talked to my broker,
Bellus.

35:21.537 --> 35:24.074
She's given you a new identity
and passage out of the Quad.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.322
We'll drop you
off on our way home.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.866
l, Uh...

35:32.131 --> 35:33.371
Printed an extra.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.209
Just in case.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.918
I've heard rumors
over the centuries

35:39.096 --> 35:40.461
that the invaders that
came to my home world

35:40.556 --> 35:42.342
are making their
way across the galaxy.

35:42.558 --> 35:43.593
Toward the Quad?

35:43.726 --> 35:44.806
lwish I knew more.

35:45.436 --> 35:47.722
But maybe this will help you
when they come.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.231
You know, the curse
of living a long life

35:56.322 --> 35:58.358
is that after a while,
everyone and everything

35:58.449 --> 36:00.064
reminds you of something
you've already done,

36:00.159 --> 36:01.569
someone you've already met.

36:03.746 --> 36:05.327
You don't remind me
ofanyone.

36:10.085 --> 36:13.794
Remember, not everyone
has a happy ending,
so be happy when you can.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.787
JOHN: Dutch is with Alvis,
so I had some time

36:49.875 --> 36:51.661
to check around,
and one of my
contacts on Utopia said

36:51.752 --> 36:53.083
she'd heard
of teleplasticity.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.035
Just a rumor.
PAWTER: About what?

36:55.130 --> 36:57.621
Well, using EMR to
disrupt thought patterns.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.047
Theoretically.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.337
Oh...

37:01.428 --> 37:03.805
I didn't realize I
left that thing on.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.220
Lucky me.

37:05.474 --> 37:06.930
So what's disrupting
thought patterns

37:07.017 --> 37:09.053
got to do with the wall?
I don't know,

37:09.186 --> 37:10.426
but I found one
of the engineers,

37:10.521 --> 37:13.388
Artura Senbek, and word is
she's in Old Town hiding out.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.768
Company employees
are still targets
in Old Town.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.395
Why is she there?
I'll ask her.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.601
I'm meeting her tonight.

37:18.821 --> 37:19.856
Oh...

37:19.947 --> 37:21.653
Well, I hope you don't
have to leave just yet.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.947
Holy shit!

You're here.
Mm-hmm.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.115
LUCY:
I hope you don’t mind.
You're here.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.948
I let the doctor onboard
to better fulfill your needs.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.533

and l have a private ship.

off for privacy, right?

37:58.152 --> 37:59.141
Mmm.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.152
Sorry for interrupting
your prayers earlier.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.359
There are a lot
of different ways
that a man can worship.

38:13.667 --> 38:14.747
Does it hurt?

38:14.835 --> 38:16.041
It's supposed to.

38:16.712 --> 38:18.293
Your pain,
our redemption, right?

38:18.380 --> 38:20.086
I don't think it
started out like that.

38:21.175 --> 38:22.506
Look.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.297
I've been going through
the Old Word with Clan.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.174
We found this story
about the sap of life.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.389
Is that the tree
everyone's always thanking?

38:31.477 --> 38:33.934
Yeah, the sap is
described as an elixir...

38:35.189 --> 38:37.396
A green elixir that
confers eternal life.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.686
You think the sap
is the plasma?

38:41.236 --> 38:42.817
(SIGHS)
I thought this was just

38:43.697 --> 38:46.530
religious metaphor,
but what if it's true?

38:46.617 --> 38:48.448
What if we're all
looking for the same thing,

38:48.535 --> 38:50.150
it's just hidden in code?

38:50.621 --> 38:52.407
I don't think the Scarbacks
started cutting themselves

38:52.498 --> 38:54.363
as penance.
I think they were doing it

38:54.458 --> 38:56.915
to prove that they weren't
infected with plasma.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.126
To show that they
can still bleed.

39:01.215 --> 39:02.375
And scar.

They died out
when I was a kid.

a root cellar.

Are we really
gonna do this?

Name me a reason
why not.

You won't respect
