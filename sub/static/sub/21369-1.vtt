00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.040 --> 00:05.210
Raven's Home was filmed

00:05.210 --> 00:07.170
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:12.750 --> 00:16.500
(alarm ringing)

00:21.330 --> 00:23.000
(laughing)
Yes!

00:23.000 --> 00:25.750
First! I finally beat you
to the bathroom.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.420
This must burn, Nia.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.960
This must burn bad.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.790
It's not a competition, Booker.

00:31.790 --> 00:34.210
I mean, I've won
the last 16 days in a row,

00:34.210 --> 00:36.620
but it's not a competition.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.830
Now, can you please hurry?

00:37.830 --> 00:39.040
Oh no, I'm first
to the bathroom.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.830
I'm gonna savor this.

00:40.830 --> 00:43.120
Take a nice, long shower,
wash my hair.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.080
I might even shave.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.170
Shave what?

00:50.540 --> 00:51.830
Hey, guys.

00:53.210 --> 00:54.250
Look at that.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.670
Levi's first.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.210
This must burn, Booker.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.040
This must burn bad.

01:00.170 --> 01:02.170
That's my body spray.

01:02.170 --> 01:04.750
The burning lets you know
you're fly.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.080
It's all good.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.580
Levi can be here.
We're like brothers.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.880
I use the bathroom
in front of him all the time.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.750
Which I repeatedly told you
I'm not comfortable with.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.830
Hey, kids!

01:17.830 --> 01:20.290
Hey, listen, um, breakfast is gonna
be a little late this morning.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.080
Had a small incident
with the toaster.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.750
On a related note--

01:23.750 --> 01:26.170
if I were a fire extinguisher,
where would I be?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.500
(smoke alarm beeping)

01:29.500 --> 01:31.330
Okay! Yeah!
I'm just gonna find it myself.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.040
-(coughs)
-Shower time.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.120
-I'm dropping robe.
-Oh, God! No!

01:40.420 --> 01:42.080
Why are you wearing
a bathing suit?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.420
Little trick I picked up
in sixth-grade gym class.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.120
Keeps everybody from seeing
my bits and pieces.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.290
Y'all better
get outta here

01:50.290 --> 01:51.750
before you see
my bits and pieces.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.380

Yep! That's us.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.040
(laughter)

02:55.880 --> 02:57.790
If you got the best
roommate in Chicago,

02:57.790 --> 02:59.170
let me hear you say
"whoop whoop!"

02:59.170 --> 03:01.380
Ha! Whoo whoo.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.120
(both laughing)

03:03.120 --> 03:04.250
If raising your kids

03:04.250 --> 03:05.620
with your best friend is

03:05.620 --> 03:08.120
both a financial necessity,
and a dream come true,

03:08.120 --> 03:09.580
let me hear you say
"whoop whoop!"

03:09.580 --> 03:11.080
Ha ha! Whoo whoo!

03:11.080 --> 03:12.670
(both laughing)

03:12.670 --> 03:14.210
If you accidentally set

03:14.210 --> 03:16.040
set the toaster on fire,

03:16.040 --> 03:17.710
let me hear you say "whoo whoo."

03:17.710 --> 03:19.210
Whoo--

03:19.210 --> 03:21.330
-Chelsea, did you kill my toaster?
-Whoo whoo.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.460
Gosh, Rae, I'm so sorry.
I am. I--

03:25.460 --> 03:27.040
I guess I was just really
excited to help out.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.330
You know, when I was married,

03:28.330 --> 03:30.170
Garrett didn't want me
to do anything.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.210
He did all the cooking.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.120
All the cleaning.
All the, uh...

03:33.120 --> 03:34.670
falling in love
with the federal agent

03:34.670 --> 03:36.170
who arrested him
for tax fraud.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.750
I can't believe that judge
only gave him a year.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.960
If I was the judge,

03:40.960 --> 03:42.380
I'd have given him
five to ten.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.500
Ah, it's not so bad.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.830
Sure, Garret stole
all my money,

03:47.830 --> 03:50.040
but I got to move in
with you, right?

03:50.040 --> 03:51.000
And if you think
about it, Rae,

03:51.000 --> 03:52.420
we are really lucky

03:52.420 --> 03:54.080
both of our marriages
fell apart.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.080
-Whoa. Yeah. -That got dark.
Got dark.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.120
Morning, Mom!
Morning, Aunt Chels!

04:06.120 --> 04:08.170
Well, hello, Nia.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.040
Hello, sweetheart.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.460
How'd you sleep?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.540
-You still doing okay on the couch?
-Of course.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.040
I wouldn't have offered Aunt Chelsea
my room if I wasn't cool with it.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.290
That's my baby girl.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.000
Nia, I never have
to worry about you.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.790
Besides, a little
sacrifice is good.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.000
You know, a lot
of my sheroes

04:23.000 --> 04:24.170
are defined
by their struggles.

04:24.170 --> 04:25.790
Rosa Parks, Oprah,

04:25.790 --> 04:27.210
-Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
-(gasps)

04:27.210 --> 04:29.210
You know what all
of those independent,

04:29.210 --> 04:31.170
spectacular women
have in common?

04:31.170 --> 04:33.250
They made the bed!

04:34.790 --> 04:36.500
-Point taken. I'm on it.
-All right!

04:36.500 --> 04:37.790
You my shero!

04:40.120 --> 04:41.250
Hi, hon!

04:41.250 --> 04:43.710
Wow. That was some
nightmare last night, huh?

04:43.710 --> 04:45.080
Yeah.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.170
Did you get back
to sleep okay?

04:46.170 --> 04:47.670
Yeah, eventually.

04:47.670 --> 04:50.080
You gotta stop reading me
scary bedtime stories.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.420
Oh! There's my
special little man.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.330
Hey! What's that
on your face?

04:57.330 --> 04:59.040
Oh, it's my face.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.460
Mommy! Cut it out!

05:01.500 --> 05:03.250
-You missed a spot.
-I know I did.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.250
Mom, could you--
could you give me a hand?

05:07.250 --> 05:08.830
Oh, in a second, sweetheart.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.040
I'm hiding the blueberries
in your brother's cereal.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.250
Love the taste,
but I hate seeing 'em.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.080
It's like my bowl's
full of doll eyes.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.830
Never mind.
I got the bed back in.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.040
I'm sorry
I didn't help you, Nia.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.120
I'm still a little sore from
the thousand push-ups I did.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.080
Please. The only thing
you've done a thousand times

05:26.080 --> 05:27.420
is tell that story.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.170
Mom! Nia said
I'm not mad shredded!

05:30.170 --> 05:32.290
Nia! Don't tell your brother
he's not mad shredded.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.000
Doesn't watching those two
make you wish you had a twin?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I like being an only child.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
There's never a question
who the favorite is.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.420
(laughing)

05:43.420 --> 05:45.040
It's me, right?

05:48.790 --> 05:50.620
All right, everybody!
Come get your bags.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.960
Your dad is downstairs
to take you to school.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.000
-Bye.
-Bye. Mwah!

05:55.000 --> 05:56.580
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye-bye. Mwah.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.120
My turn to pick the music.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.170
But you never pick anything
in my vocal range. Mom!

06:00.170 --> 06:02.790
Nia, pick something
in your brother's vocal range.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.000
Levi! Where's my kiss?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.170
Make good choices.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.500
-Bye!
-Bye.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.000
(chuckles)

06:17.000 --> 06:18.670
Hey, Chels, um...

06:18.670 --> 06:20.170
I couldn't help
but hear what Levi said,

06:20.170 --> 06:21.380
and I just want you to know

06:21.380 --> 06:23.120
that I don't have
a favorite Booker.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.290
I mean "kid."

06:25.750 --> 06:27.120
Well, of course, Rae.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.080
You love both
your Bookers equally.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.040
Come on, Chels.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.790
I mean, yes, I might
do more for Booker,

06:33.790 --> 06:35.710
but Nia knows that
I don't have a favorite.

06:35.710 --> 06:37.380
(whooshing)

06:39.330 --> 06:41.040
Everything's always
about Booker!

06:41.040 --> 06:43.080
Booker, Booker, Booker!
I'm sick of it.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.960
(whooshing)

06:44.960 --> 06:48.290
(gasps) Chels, I just had a
vision that Nia was so upset.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.210
She said that everything
was about Booker.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.460
"Booker, Booker, Booker."

06:51.460 --> 06:52.960
Why don't you just
talk to her about it?

06:52.960 --> 06:55.000
I can't do that! No, 'cause
it hasn't happened yet.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.620
I have to fix it
before it does.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.330
Or! Or! Hear me out.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.420
You could just finally
tell your kids you're psychic.

07:06.330 --> 07:07.670
No, I'm not gonna do that. No.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.170
'Cause they--
they haven't had visions,

07:10.170 --> 07:11.620
you know,
they wouldn't understand.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.170
Besides, it's like my--
my secret mommy power.

07:14.170 --> 07:15.580
And so I can give that

07:15.580 --> 07:17.040
"Don't you think
about doing that" look

07:17.040 --> 07:18.500
before they think
about doing it.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.040
Man, I wish
you gave me that look

07:21.040 --> 07:22.620
before I married Garret.

07:22.620 --> 07:23.920
I did give you that look.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.120
Your mama gave you that look,

07:25.120 --> 07:26.120
Levi gave you that look.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.000
What?! Levi wasn't
even born yet!

07:28.000 --> 07:30.620
But if he was,
he'd have given you that look.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.170
(school bell rings)

07:36.170 --> 07:37.380
Booker:
I'm telling you, Levi.

07:37.380 --> 07:39.380
The day I mastered
the slam dunk,

07:39.380 --> 07:41.290
was one of the best
of my life.

07:41.290 --> 07:43.120
-You can dunk?
-He can.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.170
He gets right under the
rim, plants his feet,

07:45.170 --> 07:46.210
and Dad lifts him up

07:46.210 --> 07:47.920
so he can drop the ball
right through the hoop.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.710
It's adorable.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.250
Yo, what up, kids?
What up kid-lite?

07:56.250 --> 07:57.500
-Hey, Tess.
-'Sup?

07:57.500 --> 07:59.080
Why do you keep
calling me "kid-lite"?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.380
'Cause you're a kid,
and you're light,

08:01.380 --> 08:03.710
and I can't remember your name.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.210
Tess, you've seen me
dunk, right?

08:05.210 --> 08:07.040
Yeah. Donuts.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.170
Sorry you had
to hear that, Levi.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.540
I know it's hard
when people question

08:13.540 --> 08:14.920
the awesomeness
of your heroes.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.960
Levi (distorted):
Okay.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.170
So I'm gonna get over
to the fourth grade hall.

08:19.170 --> 08:22.210
Whoa. What's happening?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.040
Booker?

08:24.040 --> 08:26.960
(whooshing)

08:28.120 --> 08:30.210
Booker! Get me out of here!

08:30.210 --> 08:31.880
(whooshing)

08:33.120 --> 08:34.750
-Booker?
-Levi!

08:37.040 --> 08:38.120
Your butt's okay.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.330
For my first time
wearing skinny jeans,

08:40.330 --> 08:42.750
I was hoping for better
than "okay."

08:44.620 --> 08:47.380
No, no. You were stuck
in a giant trumpet.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.830
It was like it happened,
but it didn't.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.710
-(locker rattles)
-(grunts)

08:52.710 --> 08:54.120
-(thuds)
-Levi!

08:55.210 --> 08:58.210
Help! Booker!
Get me out of here!

08:58.210 --> 08:59.420
That's what I saw.

08:59.420 --> 09:00.920
Levi!

09:00.920 --> 09:02.250
I saw the future!

09:02.250 --> 09:04.250
I pee when I feel trapped!

09:05.420 --> 09:06.920
Never mind.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.750
Nia!

09:14.750 --> 09:16.290
I need to talk to you.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.880
Something happened
and I'm freaking out.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.210
What?! Are you okay?!

09:19.210 --> 09:21.330
I saw the future.
I think I'm psychic!

09:22.330 --> 09:23.500
Ow!

09:23.500 --> 09:25.000
Booker, you scared me!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.080
I thought something
was actually wrong with you.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.420
I'm serious.
It really happened.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.170
Booker, that's impossible.
Psychics aren't real.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.420
Nia...

09:32.420 --> 09:34.380
There's something
I need to tell you.

09:35.460 --> 09:36.960
I believe in psychics.

09:39.380 --> 09:40.500
Continue.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It's just another
one of his stories!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.080
Like the push-ups,
and the dunking.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.380
And that time you said Bruno
Mars stole your dance move.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.330
No, actually, I said
Bruno stole it from Timberlake

09:52.330 --> 09:53.710
who stole it from me.

09:53.710 --> 09:54.790
But yeah, that's
what it's like.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.540
But none of those
things happened.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.790
-This did.
-(bell rings)

10:01.040 --> 10:02.830
We gotta get to class.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.710
For the record,
JT did steal my dance move.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.330
That's a hundred percent
pure Booker right there.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.960
Hey, thanks for the ride.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.620
My mom says she'll
start picking us up again

10:21.620 --> 10:23.000
when she gets
her license back.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.290
Man, you hit
three mailboxes.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.670
Tess, it's fine.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.040
No need for your mom
to get behind the wheel

10:29.040 --> 10:30.580
before she's ready.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.120
(quietly):
Or ever.

10:33.790 --> 10:36.540
-You coming over to do homework?
-Be there in a little bit.

10:38.210 --> 10:40.540
Come on, Ma!
We eat off that table!

10:43.540 --> 10:45.920
I haven't had
any more visions today.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.000
What if what I thought
happened didn't really happen?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.830
Well, I peed
in a sousaphone,

10:49.830 --> 10:52.170
and now I'm wearing shorts
from Lost and Found,

10:52.170 --> 10:55.210
and Jamal Epstein's
underpants.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.750
So I'm pretty sure
it happened.

10:58.170 --> 10:59.460
Jamal Epstein's
in kindergarten.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.170
Yeah. They're pretty tight.

11:03.170 --> 11:05.210
Hey, Rae!
You're home from work early.

11:05.210 --> 11:07.500
Yeah, I couldn't stop thinking
about the vision of Nia,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.880
so I came home early
to make it right.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.880
Today, it's all about Nia.

11:14.330 --> 11:15.960
Got a special little treat

11:15.960 --> 11:19.210
for my special little lady!

11:19.210 --> 11:22.040
Wow! It's a lot of cupcakes
for no reason.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.580
Mom! The weirdest
thing happened--

11:26.580 --> 11:28.000
It's not always
about you, Booker.

11:31.710 --> 11:32.960
It's Nia time!

11:37.080 --> 11:38.500
Why is this happening?

11:40.210 --> 11:42.040
I don't need a reason
to celebrate

11:42.040 --> 11:43.120
my special little lady.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.830
(gasps) That's what I'm
gonna call you from now on.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.880
"My special little lady."
You like it?

11:47.880 --> 11:50.120
It's making me
a tiny bit uncomfortable.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.750
(laughing)

11:54.830 --> 11:56.000
She's hilarious!

11:56.000 --> 11:57.080
(laughing)

11:57.080 --> 11:58.540
Just like your mama.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.920
Mom, before when
you yelled at me,

12:00.920 --> 12:03.210
you probably thought I was
Nia, but it was me, Booker.

12:03.210 --> 12:04.330
Shhh.

12:04.330 --> 12:07.170
No one's talking
to you, sweetie.

12:07.170 --> 12:09.170
-Nia's talking. Continue.
-No, I'm not.

12:09.170 --> 12:10.380
Yes, you are,
yes, you are.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.460
I'm all ears, sweetie. Tell me.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.670
We had a sub
in English today.

12:13.670 --> 12:16.040
(gasps)
A sub?!

12:17.170 --> 12:18.670
In English?

12:18.670 --> 12:20.380
No! No!

12:20.380 --> 12:21.580
Chels!

12:23.080 --> 12:25.750
Nia had a sub...

12:25.750 --> 12:27.380
in English.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.420
Okay.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.170
Ma, if you think
a sub is crazy--

12:32.170 --> 12:33.420
Booker, back off!

12:33.420 --> 12:35.000
-(thuds)
-It's Nia time.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.830
Continue, sweetie. Go on.

12:38.830 --> 12:41.960
Say, hon, are those the same
pants you left in this morning?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.580
-They are not.
-Yeah. Been there.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I don't get it.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.210
The craziest thing that's
ever happened to me happened,

12:56.210 --> 12:57.540
and I can't get
anyone to listen.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.000
Just have another vision.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.620
Then everyone will believe you.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.000
Okay, I'll try to make it
happen again.

13:05.080 --> 13:05.960
(farts)

13:08.120 --> 13:09.460
Oops.

13:09.460 --> 13:12.080
-Are we gonna talk about that?
-Don't see any reason to.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.290
This isn't working.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.120
Every time I close my eyes,

13:19.120 --> 13:21.750
I see Nia's face saying
she doesn't believe me.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.750
Why do you care
what she thinks?

13:23.750 --> 13:25.960
-I don't.
-Seems like you do.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.120
Yo! It's weird out there.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.830
Your mom's clipping
Nia's toenails,

13:30.830 --> 13:32.880
and she got mad when
I asked her to do mine.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.710
So, Future Boy,
had any more visions?

13:36.710 --> 13:38.580
No. I don't even
know how they work.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.460
It's almost like
they come at random--

13:40.460 --> 13:41.960
(whooshing)

13:43.170 --> 13:44.790
Why would the bag hit me?!

13:44.790 --> 13:46.170
(Nia screams)

13:46.170 --> 13:47.040
(whooshing)

13:48.920 --> 13:50.170
I just had another one!

13:50.170 --> 13:51.380
It was Nia!
She's gonna get hurt!

13:51.380 --> 13:52.460
What happened?
I didn't do it.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.040
Why you coming
at me like that?

13:55.580 --> 13:57.120
Tess, calm down.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.920
I... just want to warn her.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.080
She won't even listen to me.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.710
I could talk to her.

14:02.710 --> 14:03.790
Maybe she'll listen to me.

14:03.790 --> 14:04.960
Quiet down, booster seat.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.670
We're trying to come up
with a plan.

14:08.290 --> 14:11.040
I got it! You could psychically
contact your dead grandma

14:11.040 --> 14:12.500
and tell her to tell Nia!

14:12.500 --> 14:13.710
Nah, that won't work.

14:13.710 --> 14:15.210
Both my grandmas
are still alive.

14:15.210 --> 14:16.330
Bummer!

14:19.500 --> 14:22.460
Nia! You wanna look through
our photo library together?

14:22.460 --> 14:24.120
I found the most
adorable picture

14:24.120 --> 14:25.620
of the cutest girl
in the worl--

14:25.620 --> 14:27.500
Ooh. That's Booker, my bad.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.040
Nia? Nia?

14:31.040 --> 14:32.920
Nia?

14:34.170 --> 14:35.880
Oh, son of a Chelsea!

14:39.330 --> 14:41.000
Whoo.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.080
We gotta put
a bell on you, boy.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.460
Hey, Auntie Rae,
have you seen Nia?

14:47.460 --> 14:49.380
No, and I don't
love Booker more.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.540
Stop judging me, Levi.

14:50.540 --> 14:51.920
Nia, Nia!

14:54.040 --> 14:55.750
Nia?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.040
Is she gone?

14:58.210 --> 14:59.330
You're good.

14:59.330 --> 15:02.170
I don't know what's
going on with my mom, Levi.

15:02.170 --> 15:04.000
She says she wants
to hang out, but...

15:04.000 --> 15:06.040
I feel like I'm being hunted.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.290
Raven:
Nia?

15:07.290 --> 15:08.380
Nia! Nia!

15:08.380 --> 15:09.580
I'm going back in.

15:09.580 --> 15:10.750
No, you can't.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.250
You have to go
talk to Booker.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.960
He had another vision.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.920
Levi...

15:15.920 --> 15:17.080
you don't really
believe that, do you?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.920
Yeah. I do.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.080
This time the vision
was about you.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.120
Fine.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.000
I think it's crazy, but...
I'll go talk to him.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.960
But how am I gonna
get past my mom?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.670
Auntie Rae?

15:29.670 --> 15:31.750
Nia just went up
to the roof deck!

15:31.750 --> 15:34.580
Oh, come on, Nia!
I just want to hang out!

15:37.000 --> 15:39.670
Wow. You really
get this family.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.830
There's gotta be some way

15:43.830 --> 15:45.170
to prove to Nia
that I'm psychic.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.420
Hold up. I got it.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.620
We can fake it.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.210
Just tell her that
you saw the future

15:49.210 --> 15:51.290
and you're gonna
get punched in the face.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.120
Then I'll punch you
in your face.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.330
Um, no.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.120
But a fake vision
is perfect.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.830
Then Nia will have
to believe me.

16:02.830 --> 16:04.170
Fake a vision?

16:05.250 --> 16:07.460
You were gonna lie to me?

16:07.460 --> 16:09.040
I thought about knocking,

16:09.040 --> 16:11.080
then I thought,
it'd be weird if I did,

16:11.080 --> 16:12.460
'cause it's my room.

16:13.710 --> 16:15.040
But now I wish I knocked.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.670
-Nia, I can explain--
-No!

16:19.670 --> 16:21.080
I get it.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.250
You're so desperate
for attention,

16:22.250 --> 16:24.210
you have to make up
crazy stories.

16:24.210 --> 16:26.040
Now you're pretending
to be psychic?!

16:26.040 --> 16:27.170
I'm not pretending.

16:27.170 --> 16:30.080
Did you ever think that maybe
you're not that special?

16:30.080 --> 16:31.330
Maybe you're just
plain old Booker?

16:31.330 --> 16:32.460
Or maybe
you're just jealous

16:32.460 --> 16:34.500
that I have this awesome power,
and you don't.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.540
How can I be jealous

16:35.540 --> 16:38.000
of something
that's not even real?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.380
You're such a liar.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.080
Oh, I'm a liar?

16:41.080 --> 16:43.170
Well, maybe,
I'll just let my vision happen.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.830
Then we'll see who's a liar.

16:49.880 --> 16:50.920
(door slams)

16:50.920 --> 16:52.920
Why'd he just
walk into his closet?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.040
Why are you never
in your own apartment?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.120
♪ Hah! ♪

17:04.120 --> 17:05.170
♪ Huh! ♪

17:05.170 --> 17:06.580
♪ Whoo! ♪

17:08.880 --> 17:10.250
Chels.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.880
-This is bad.
-Yeah.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.250
Raven: I've never seen Nia and
Booker so mad at each other.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.620
Do you think giving Nia too
much attention made it worse?

17:16.620 --> 17:19.080
Maybe these T-shirts
were a bad idea.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.670
Rae, how can you say that?

17:22.670 --> 17:24.500
These shirts are great!

17:24.500 --> 17:27.170
What is this?
Like a cotton/poly blend?

17:27.170 --> 17:28.750
Everything's always
about Booker.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.960
Booker, Booker, Booker!
I'm sick of it!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.960
-(door closes)
-All I did was ask for salt.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.250
It was your tone.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.210
All right, everybody! Your dad's
downstairs to take you to school.

17:42.210 --> 17:44.460
Have a good day,
my favorite... son,

17:44.460 --> 17:46.420
my favorite daughter,
my favorite Levi.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.750
Yes! Got everybody! I'm not
making that mistake again.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.120
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye-bye, sweetheart.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.290
Nia kissed that cheek.
I want a fresh one.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.830
Oh.

18:00.670 --> 18:03.620
Well, time for the world's
most awkward ride to school.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.040
Chels, what am I gonna do?

18:07.040 --> 18:10.080
Rae, brothers and sisters fight.
They're gonna work it out.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.000
(whooshing)

18:15.210 --> 18:18.790
Family drama has
no place in gym class.

18:18.790 --> 18:19.960
You're suspended.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
(whooshing)

18:22.000 --> 18:24.920
(gasps) Chels, it's
not gonna work out.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.500
I think Booker and Nia are gonna
get suspended from gym class.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.080
-I gotta get down to the school!
-Wait, wait, wait!

18:29.080 --> 18:31.250
You can't just bust in their
gym class like that!

18:31.250 --> 18:33.250
-Why not?!
-You're wearing wedges, Rae!

18:33.250 --> 18:35.040
They got no traction!

18:36.080 --> 18:37.170
You right, you right. Okay.

18:37.170 --> 18:38.920
Let me go change
into some sneakers.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.580
I'm gonna change
my shirt and shave.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.040
-What? -What? There's a lot of
single parents at that school.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.830
I can't believe I got
paired with my sister

18:53.830 --> 18:55.330
for doubles tennis.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.040
Stupid alphabetical order.

18:58.290 --> 18:59.750
Why do you even
need a partner?

18:59.750 --> 19:01.670
Aren't you the best
tennis player in Chicago?

19:01.670 --> 19:03.540
Or was that just another lie?

19:03.540 --> 19:05.420
Oh, very funny, Nia.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.580
By the way, when I said
you were funny,

19:07.580 --> 19:08.710
that was a lie.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.790
(whistle trills)

19:20.210 --> 19:21.620
Raven (whispering):
Booker! Nia!

19:21.620 --> 19:23.210
Booker, Nia! Oh, you--

19:23.210 --> 19:24.960
Excuse me. Booker! Ni--

19:24.960 --> 19:26.120
Oh!

19:31.420 --> 19:32.580
Just so you know,

19:32.580 --> 19:34.290
my vision happens
here in gym class.

19:34.290 --> 19:37.040
Just so you know, I still
don't believe you're psychic.

19:38.670 --> 19:41.170
Ohhh, man.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.380
All right, let's do it.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.580
Let's go.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.040
Excuse me!

19:45.040 --> 19:46.210
Excuse me! Coming through!

19:46.210 --> 19:47.330
Oh! Sorry!

19:47.330 --> 19:49.290
Concerned mom.
I'm a concerned mother.

19:49.290 --> 19:50.670
Don't hit me. Okay.

19:50.670 --> 19:51.830
Excuse me, excuse me.

19:51.830 --> 19:54.540
Ow! Serena Williams! That hurt!

19:54.540 --> 19:56.790
(kids laughing)

19:59.210 --> 20:00.420
Bring it on.

20:04.460 --> 20:05.830
That--

20:05.830 --> 20:07.080
Whoop! (grunts)

20:14.040 --> 20:15.920
Game.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.080
Set.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.330
Uh-oh.

20:20.790 --> 20:21.920
(grunts)

20:23.040 --> 20:24.880
Booker, the heavy bag!

20:27.380 --> 20:29.040
How did you know about that?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.290
In my vision, the bag hit you.

20:30.290 --> 20:32.290
Why would the bag hit me?

20:32.290 --> 20:33.670
-(Nia screams)
-Nia!

20:35.460 --> 20:38.120
(screaming continues)

20:38.120 --> 20:39.540
Ow.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.120
Nia! Are you okay?

20:44.040 --> 20:46.040
(chuckles)
That was crazy.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.290
I know.

20:47.290 --> 20:49.380
I should have done
something to stop it.

20:49.380 --> 20:50.880
No.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.460
I mean, you said the heavy bag was
gonna hit me and then it hit me.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.960
You really are psychic.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.580
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.080
I get it.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.500
I tell a lot of crazy stories.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.000
But this one was true.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.290
And you're my twin brother,
I should have known that.

21:07.290 --> 21:09.040
I'm glad you know
I wasn't lying.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.670
I know I don't
show it all the time,

21:12.670 --> 21:15.120
but... I care what you think.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.080
If you ever tell
anyone I said this,

21:18.080 --> 21:20.920
I'll blame it on
the heavy bag, but...

21:20.920 --> 21:22.670
I think you're pretty great.

21:24.290 --> 21:27.540
Aww. Look at my
two perfect angels.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.830
(sighs) Guess they're not
gonna get suspended.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.290
Guess my vision was wrong.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.880
Miss Baxter.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.000
May I have a word?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
-Mom?!
-Mom?!

21:40.000 --> 21:41.460
Oh, snap!

21:43.250 --> 21:44.380
Principal Wentworth,

21:44.380 --> 21:46.420
we are so sorry
for our mother's behavior.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.330
We can assure you
that nothing like this

21:48.330 --> 21:50.120
will ever happen again.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.620
Right, Mom?

21:51.620 --> 21:54.120
-It wasn't my fault!
-Mom!

21:55.330 --> 21:56.540
(clears throat)

21:56.540 --> 21:58.040
I apologize.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.040
Miss Baxter...

22:00.040 --> 22:02.460
I've never had to do
this to a parent before.

22:02.460 --> 22:06.290
But family drama
has no place in gym class.

22:06.290 --> 22:08.040
You're suspended.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.120
Please stay away
from our school

22:10.120 --> 22:11.000
for three weeks.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.620
You're suspending me
for being an involved parent?

22:13.620 --> 22:17.420
No. I'm suspending you
for assaulting the gym teacher!

22:21.040 --> 22:22.500
That's fair.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.170
So you convinced Nia
that you're psychic?

22:30.170 --> 22:31.170
That's awesome!

22:31.170 --> 22:33.540
Yep! Now the only person
left to tell is my mom.

22:33.540 --> 22:36.210
Your mom overreacts
about everything.

22:36.210 --> 22:38.210
-You can't tell her.
-You're right.

22:38.210 --> 22:40.540
Raven Baxter would not
understand psychic visions.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.120
Hey, Nia.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.670
You know that Booker's
not my favorite, right?

22:49.670 --> 22:51.620
-I know, Mom. -Good.
It's just that sometimes

22:51.620 --> 22:54.000
I have to do more for him, just so
he won't, you know, like, uh...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.330
-Burn the house down?
-Or flood it.

22:56.330 --> 22:59.540
You know sometimes my baby boy
can be a bit of a disaster.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.120
I get it.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.750
And I like being independent.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.880
But I also like when
I get your attention.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.330
The good kind,
not the crazy kind.

23:06.330 --> 23:08.830
Oh, baby. You know I can't
tell the difference.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.460
Come on, let's go.
(laughing)

23:13.460 --> 23:16.170
I'm telling you it's true.
He stole it.

23:16.170 --> 23:17.750
Bieber must have seen
that video of me

23:17.750 --> 23:20.040
on the Internet
or something, 'cause...

23:22.210 --> 23:23.670
You said it was Bruno Mars.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.460
You said it was
Justin Timberlake.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.290
Wait. You told me
it was his choreographer.

23:27.290 --> 23:29.960
Booker! You just lying.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.960
The only person who stole
that move was you...

23:32.960 --> 23:34.000
from me!

23:35.580 --> 23:36.670
Bam!

23:37.830 --> 23:39.120

um, order a pizza.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.210
Way ahead of you, Mom.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.170
Yo, kids meal.

24:04.170 --> 24:06.120
How'd you know
this was gonna happen?

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
You psychic too?

24:07.120 --> 24:09.580
No. I do this every time
my mom grills.
