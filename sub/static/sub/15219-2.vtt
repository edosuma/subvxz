- What happened?
- It's over.

44:23.249 --> 44:26.218
This thing is drivin' me nuts.
You'll get it off soon enough.

44:28.288 --> 44:30.313
And then what?

44:30.390 --> 44:33.826
He's got his card.
He'll come to work for us.

44:33.893 --> 44:36.191
What about his music?

44:36.262 --> 44:39.356
He's real good, Mr. Stone.
Real good.

44:41.401 --> 44:44.336
Well, yeah, I guess he's okay
for a stuntman.

44:44.404 --> 44:49.307
<i>Uh! Look, no offense, Chris, but...</i>

44:49.375 --> 44:54.244
- he shouldn't be a stuntman any more than--
-<i>[ Man ] We now switch</i>
<i>to a live broadcast of the president</i>--

44:54.314 --> 44:58.910
Heh! Gerald Ford.
Look, Chris's future is in his music.

44:58.985 --> 45:02.512
- Now you know the future.
-<i>[ Al ] Sam.</i>

45:02.588 --> 45:05.318
<i>I</i>--<i>Sam, I remember this.</i>

45:05.391 --> 45:09.555
- <i>He trips at the bottom of the stairs.</i>
- [ Woman ]
...in good spirits after their flight,

45:09.629 --> 45:12.689
waving to the crowd
of some 600 spectators.
Uh, yeah.

45:12.765 --> 45:15.427
Dad, I do know the future.

45:15.501 --> 45:19.062
- Ford's gonna trip down those stairs.
- No, no. Not again.

45:19.138 --> 45:24.701
- No way you know what he's gonna do.
This is live.
- I'll bet you Chris's future I do.

45:24.777 --> 45:27.837
- [ Men, Together] What?
- That's brilliant, Sam, brilliant.

45:27.914 --> 45:33.580
I say that Ford's gonna trip down these stairs.
And if I'm right, you get behind Chris
becoming a musician.

45:35.488 --> 45:38.457
- And if you're wrong?
- I get behind him becoming a stuntman.

45:38.524 --> 45:42.756
- Wait a minute. This is my future we're--
- Relax. Trust me. I know what I'm doin'.

45:43.863 --> 45:46.764
You're on, bud.

45:49.969 --> 45:52.938
[ Whispers ]
You sure this is where he trips?

45:53.005 --> 45:56.202
Ehh, pretty sure.

45:56.275 --> 45:59.506
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Thank you, Linda. You think we should</i>
<i>include this unofficial information?</i>

45:59.579 --> 46:02.241
- [ Linda ] Well-- Oh,just a minute.
They're coming down the stairs now...
- [ Pensive Humming ]

46:02.315 --> 46:04.545
to great applause
from the spectators, and--

46:04.617 --> 46:07.313
- Oop!
- [ All Laughing ]

46:08.721 --> 46:11.554
What a memory, huh?
What a memory!

46:11.624 --> 46:16.994
<i>[ Linda ] It looks like he'll be okay.</i>
<i>[ Man ] Uh, Linda, do you have visual</i>
<i>of the president at this time?</i>

46:37.583 --> 46:41.610
[ Thinking ]
Oh, my God. I'm Popeye!

46:53.099 --> 46:58.059
(music) Summer nights
fallin' around my shoulder (music)

46:59.739 --> 47:05.371
(music) The desert wind
blowin' across my mind (music)

47:07.146 --> 47:12.516
(music) Hold me tight out on the borderline (music)

47:13.519 --> 47:17.046
(music) It's a long way there
down a one-way trail (music)

47:17.123 --> 47:20.957
(music) To the love that I left behind (music)

47:21.961 --> 47:25.988
(music) Out of sight
Can't see past you and me (music)

47:26.065 --> 47:28.465
(music) I'm haunted like a wanted man (music)

47:28.534 --> 47:32.971
(music) Out of time
Too late, my mistake (music)

47:33.039 --> 47:36.008
(music) But you gotta understand (music)

47:36.075 --> 47:40.774
(music) I've been dealin' with the pain
of lovin' you the best I can (music)

47:42.849 --> 47:48.014
(music) And I'm just another stranger
lookin' for the promised land (music)

47:49.305 --> 47:55.838
