WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.403
April:  PREVIOUSLY ON
CHASING LIFE.

00:02.435 --> 00:03.604
UNCLE GEORGE LOOKED
INTO THAT CLINICAL TRIAL...

00:03.637 --> 00:06.240
AND YOU KNOW WHO
MAKES THE DRUGS?
PHARKAS.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.409
I KIND OF ASKED YOU OUT
FOR THAT FRIEND OF MINE.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.244
I WOULD'VE TRIED TO HELP
YOUR FRIEND ANYWAY,
BUT I'M GLAD YOU DID.

00:11.278 --> 00:14.180
I HOPE ONE DAY WHEN...

00:14.214 --> 00:16.716
WE'RE IN A ROCKING CHAIR...

00:16.751 --> 00:18.452
I'LL REMIND YOU OF
THIS CONVERSATION...

00:18.486 --> 00:21.655
AND WE'LL LAUGH
BECAUSE IN THE END,
WE HAD IT ALL.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.696
Dispatcher:  9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

00:28.728 --> 00:31.030
(sobbing) MY HUSBAND...
HE'S NOT BREATHING.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.171
(voices echoing)

01:04.063 --> 01:06.233
SO, UM...

01:06.266 --> 01:09.736
I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE ON-CALL
DOCTORS AND THEY'RE PRETTY SURE
IT WAS A NEUROLOGICAL INCIDENT.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.507
LEO'S TUMOR WAS GONE.
HE WAS FINE.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.311
WELL, IT WAS PROBABLY
A SMALL HEMORRHAGE FROM
DAMAGED BLOOD VESSELS.

01:18.344 --> 01:21.382
BUT HE HAD CHECK-UPS
EVERY FEW MONTHS.
THEY DID CAT SCANS.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.685
WELL, THE BRAIN IS A
DELICATE AND COMPLEX ORGAN...

01:24.718 --> 01:29.522
AND WITH HIS TUMOR
AND THE RADIATION
AND THE SURGERY--

01:29.557 --> 01:32.293
HE SAID HE HAD A HEADACHE
A FEW DAYS AGO.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.627
WAS THAT IT?

01:33.661 --> 01:36.496
-SHOULD WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING?
COULD I HAVE--
-HONEY.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.331
George: IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST A HEADACHE.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.533
AND WHAT HAPPENED JUST...

01:40.567 --> 01:43.236
IT HAPPENED.
AND IT HAPPENED QUICKLY.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.609
SOMEONE FROM THE HOSPITAL
WILL EVENTUALLY NEED
TO KNOW THE PLANS.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.844
WHAT PLANS?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.412
FUNERAL PLANS.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.781
Bruce:
BEFORE HIS LAST SURGERY,

01:54.814 --> 02:00.353
LEO LEFT SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
AS TO HOW HE WANTED TO BE LAID
TO REST.

02:00.387 --> 02:04.391
BUT, APRIL, WE SHOULD MAKE SURE
THOSE ARE OKAY WITH YOU.

SHE COULDN'T.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.420

ANYTHING ELSE FROM
THE APARTMENT?

06:19.612 --> 06:22.582
I JUST-- I CAN'T GO
BACK THERE. IT'S...

06:22.615 --> 06:23.716
IT'S TOO MUCH.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.052
THEN WE'LL GET YOUR THINGS.

YEAH, WE'LL JUST,
YOU KNOW,

06:26.887 --> 06:28.454
PACK IT UP AND
BRING IT BACK HERE.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.456
FOR NOW THAT'D
BE GREAT. THANKS.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.560
HEY.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.029
IT WAS A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL FUNERAL,
APRIL.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.731
SO VERY LEO.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.500
IT WAS.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.603
-I'M GONNA MISS HIM.
-ME, TOO, BUDDY.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.173
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD GUY.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.610
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.480
MAYBE WE'LL SEE YOU
AT SUPPORT GROUP?
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.548
SURE, MAYBE.

07:00.086 --> 07:05.091
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I FINALLY
COME TO TERMS WITH THE AWKWARD
SYMPATHY ABOUT CANCER,

07:05.125 --> 07:06.692
BUT THIS IS
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

07:06.726 --> 07:10.764
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE KEEP SAYING
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD GUY.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.867
I EVEN GOT ONE..."HEAVEN
NEEDED ANOTHER ANGEL."

07:16.069 --> 07:17.069
HEY.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.507
I AM...

07:20.540 --> 07:22.475
VERY SORRY FOR
YOUR LOSS, APRIL.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.776
THANK YOU.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.211
YOU'RE BEING SO BRAVE.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.915
I'M NOT ACTUALLY
BEING BRAVE.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.685
I'M JUST SUPPRESSING
MY REAL EMOTIONS TO MAKE
EVERYONE HERE COMFORTABLE.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.154
EXCUSE ME.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.490
YEAH.

07:46.667 --> 07:50.036
I CAN'T BEAR
TO SEE HER LIKE THIS.
IT BREAKS MY HEART.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.704
WELL...

07:51.737 --> 07:53.973
WITH THE FUNERAL BEHIND HER,
SHE CAN START TO HEAL.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.475
SHE'S LOST THE
LOVE OF HER LIFE.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.077
AND SPEAKING
FROM EXPERIENCE...

07:58.110 --> 08:00.880
THINGS DON'T GET ANY
EASIER AFTER THE FUNERAL.

08:00.913 --> 08:04.084
WATCHING EVERYONE MOVE ON,
AND WONDERING WHY YOU CAN'T.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.754
LOSING THOMAS WAS PROBABLY
THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER
BEEN THROUGH.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.692
I GUESS BACK THEN, I GOT PRETTY
GOOD AT COMPARTMENTALIZING
THINGS WHEN I WAS PRACTICING

08:11.725 --> 08:15.562
FOCUSING ON THE PATIENT,
NOT THE PERSON.

08:15.596 --> 08:19.266
YOU WEREN'T HERE
TO SEE IT, BUT I JUST
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.168
APRIL HAD TO MOVE
HOME TO KEEP THE
FAMILY FUNCTIONING.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.269
IT'S NOT AN EASY RECOVERY.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.538
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR.

08:25.572 --> 08:30.776
I'M JUST NOW BEING ABLE
TO PUT THINGS BEHIND ME,
DESPITE ALL OF THOMAS' SECRETS.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.812
DO YOU KNOW THE GIRLS
WERE ASKING ABOUT

08:32.846 --> 08:37.017
SOME MANUSCRIPT OF THOMAS',
SOMETHING HE WAS WORKING ON
BEFORE HE DIED.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.919
DID YOU READ IT?

08:39.952 --> 08:42.556
NO. THE PAST IS THE PAST.

08:42.588 --> 08:46.592
AND RIGHT NOW
THE PAST FOR APRIL
PROBABLY FEELS LIKE...

08:46.626 --> 08:48.061
FOREVER FROM NOW.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.866
SOMEONE SHOULD TEACH
A CLASS OR SOMETHING.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.669
OH, THAT WOULD TAKE
AWAY ALL THE FUN.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.971
(sighs) WHAT FUN?
IT'S A FUNERAL?

08:59.005 --> 09:02.241
YET PEOPLE SEEM TO SAY AND DO
THE MOST RIDICULOUS THINGS.

09:02.275 --> 09:06.145
AND IF ONE MORE PERSON SAYS,
"HE WAS A GOOD GUY,"
I'M GONNA LOSE IT.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.948
HEY! I WAS A GOOD GUY!

09:08.981 --> 09:10.116
YOU WERE.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.020
YOU WERE THE BEST.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.325
HOW WAS IT?
WAS IT AWESOME?

09:18.557 --> 09:19.625
OF COURSE.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.861
-THE DRAG QUEEN?
-WAS FIERCE.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.298
HOW DID THE PUPPET REENACTMENT
OF SALLY FIELD BREAKDOWN IN
STEEL MAGNOLIAS  GO OVER?

09:25.331 --> 09:27.801
HONESTLY, THAT ONE GOT
SOME MIXED REVIEWS.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.068
REALLY?

09:29.101 --> 09:31.804
WELL, I WANTED TO DO
A WHOLE VIKING-STYLE
SEND-OFF,

09:31.837 --> 09:36.076
BUT FLAMING BOATS IN
THE CHARLES RIVER ARE
APPARENTLY ILLEGAL.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.344
WHO KNEW?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.713
YOU DIDN'T NEED
ANY OF THAT.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.149
YOUR FUNERAL WAS PERFECT.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.652
YOU KNOW...

09:47.821 --> 09:49.623
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR
TIME WITH ALL THIS.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.159
YOU THINK?

09:53.192 --> 09:54.594
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.364
JUST STAY UP
HERE WITH ME.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.033
Brenna: APE...

10:05.839 --> 10:07.006
GOOD NIGHT, BREN.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.659
HEY, MRS. CARVER.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.161
HI. DOMINIC, RIGHT?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.196
YEAH.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.230
COME ON IN.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.697
THANKS.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.739
YOU'RE APRIL'S FORMER--

10:38.772 --> 10:40.039
CO-WORKER?

10:40.072 --> 10:41.908
OH, I WAS GONNA
SAY BOYFRIEND.

10:41.942 --> 10:42.975
THEN YOU'D BE CORRECT.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.244
YEAH.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.013
AND NATALIE'S FORMER--

10:46.046 --> 10:48.248
YOU'D BE CORRECT THERE, TOO.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.415
IS APRIL HOME?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.984
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.284
COME ON.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.427
HEY, I'M SORRY FOR
JUST STOPPING BY.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.929
I WASN'T SURE IF YOU WERE
GETTING ANY OF MY TEXTS.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.166
I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN IN
THE MOOD FOR SOCIALIZING.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.833
YEAH, I BET.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.004
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.139
THANKS.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.347
I AM SO SORRY.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.951
IS THERE...

11:24.985 --> 11:26.385
ANYTHING...

11:26.419 --> 11:27.888
I CAN DO?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.256
I GUESS YOU COULD TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.793
I GOTTA BE HONEST...

11:32.826 --> 11:34.894
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.866
THINGS WITH ME AND
LEO WERE DIFFICULT,

11:40.900 --> 11:42.168
BUT HE WAS A GOOD GUY--

11:42.201 --> 11:43.769
STOP IT.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.773
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.475
YOU CAN'T SAY
HE WAS A GOOD GUY

11:49.709 --> 11:53.145
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET
INTO BAR FIGHTS WITH PEOPLE
YOU THINK ARE GOOD GUYS.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.481
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
YOU CAME TO THE FUNERAL.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.350
YOU'RE ONLY HERE NOW TO
MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.787
NO, NO. I'M HERE FOR YOU.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.423
I DON'T NEED YOU.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.957
I NEVER DID.
WE WERE...

12:04.990 --> 12:08.495
COWORKERS WHO DATED
FOR LIKE A MINUTE.
THAT'S IT!

12:08.727 --> 12:10.330
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

12:10.363 --> 12:14.433
I NEVER SHOULD'VE TRIED
TO KEEP OUR FRIENDSHIP
WHEN I WAS WITH LEO.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.235
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.105
GO AWAY.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.207
I KNOW YOU DON'T
MEAN THAT.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.375
PLEASE, DOMINIC.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.510
LEAVE ME ALONE.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.364
IT'S SO NICE OUT.

12:46.332 --> 12:49.168
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE NOT
BURIED UNDER THREE FEET
OF SNOW ALREADY.

12:51.437 --> 12:55.542
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH...

12:57.878 --> 13:00.514
AND I DON'T MEAN
TO RUSH YOU,

13:00.547 --> 13:03.783
BUT IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU
GET BACK TO YOUR LIFE?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.451
WHAT LIFE, MOM?

13:05.485 --> 13:08.221
I UNDERSTAND THAT
IT FEELS LIKE THAT
RIGHT NOW,

13:08.254 --> 13:11.991
BUT YOU STILL
HAVE FRIENDS,

13:12.024 --> 13:13.360
ME, BRENNA,

13:13.393 --> 13:15.061
YOUR BOOK.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.931
AND IF NOTHING ELSE,
YOU GOTTA STAY FOCUSED
ON YOUR HEALTH.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.399
I AM FOCUSED
ON MY HEALTH.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.433
UNCLE GEORGE STILL HAS
TO MEET WITH PEOPLE,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.802
TO SEE IF I CAN GET
INTO THE NEXT TRIAL.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.504
IT'S NOT FOR
ANOTHER WEEK, SO...

13:27.506 --> 13:29.375
THAT'S TODAY, HONEY.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.577
AND HE SAID HE MIGHT NEED
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.215
THEY'RE AT
THE APARTMENT.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.884
DO YOU WANT TO...

13:37.918 --> 13:40.253
GO BACK THERE TOGETHER
AND PICK THEM UP?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.490
I'LL CALL BETH OR NATALIE.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.426
THEY'RE PACKING UP MY STUFF.
I'LL SEE IF THEY CAN BRING IT
BY TODAY.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.995
OKAY... OKAY.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.267
(school bell ringing)

13:54.301 --> 13:56.036
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW, BREN.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.004
I WISH YOU COULD'VE MET HIM.

13:59.038 --> 14:02.442
HE WAS JUST LIKE,
SO FULL OF LIFE.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.477
WELL, HE'S... IN
A BETTER PLACE NOW?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.214
WHERE? IN THE GROUND?

14:07.246 --> 14:11.451
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO APRIL
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.386
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN THINK
THAT SHE REALLY WANTS

14:14.421 --> 14:15.922
TO TALK TO ME ANYWAY.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.423
WELL, JUST GIVE HER
SOME REASSURANCE.

14:17.456 --> 14:18.991
HOW?

14:19.024 --> 14:22.394
I MEAN,
HE WAS CANCER-FREE
AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.931
IT'S LIKE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE
HEALTHY, YOU MIGHT--

14:24.965 --> 14:27.433
(clears throat)
LET'S CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.068
ELLE VERSUS DAKOTA. GO.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.471
DON'T AVOID THE CONVERSATION
BECAUSE OF ME.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.472
I'M OKAY TO GO THERE.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.442
OKAY.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.510
WELL...

14:38.544 --> 14:40.179
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SICK?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.249
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.084
I HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK,

14:44.116 --> 14:46.052
BUT ME AND MY PARENTS
JUST THOUGHT IT WAS THE FLU.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.554
EVEN MY DOCTORS
MISDIAGNOSED ME AT FIRST.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.456
BUT ONCE WE FOUND OUT WHAT
WE WERE DEALING WITH,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.524
IT'D BEEN ABOUT A MONTH
AND I HAD TO LOSE MY LEG.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.163
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.532
DON'T BE. I'M OKAY.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.402
IT'D ONLY BE SAD
IF I LET IT KEEP ME DOWN.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.903
I'M GONNA BEAT THIS.
AND I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

15:04.937 --> 15:09.109
I'M ALSO GONNA BEAT
MY BEST TIME FOR THE
200 METER THIS SPRING.

15:09.142 --> 15:13.312
YOU CAN BARELY WALK DOWN
THE HALL WITHOUT STOPPING
FOR A BREAK.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.115
(scoffs) NOW. BUT WHO KNOWS
WHERE I'LL BE IN A WEEK OR TWO.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.385
I'M GONNA HIT THE TRACK
AFTER SCHOOL IF YOU WANT
TO JOIN ME.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.554
YEAH, I GUESS I COULD
USE AN AFTERNOON
AWAY FROM HOME.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.297
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
BEING HERE, RIGHT?

15:32.197 --> 15:35.501
I DON'T BLAME HER FOR
NOT WANTING TO COME BACK HERE,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.980
OH! HEY, I THINK I FOUND
APRIL'S MEDICAL STUFF.

15:48.014 --> 15:51.084
YOU CAN GO.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THE REST OF ALL THIS.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.251
YEAH.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.090
YOU KNOW,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.491
I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.559
I'VE NEVER...

16:00.592 --> 16:03.096
LOST ANYONE
CLOSE TO ME.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.399
MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 18,

16:07.433 --> 16:09.702
AND IT WAS SO HARD.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.105
EVEN WITH OUR
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.073
I CRIED FOR DAYS.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.244
YEAH, SEE,
I HAVEN'T CRIED YET.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.446
IS THAT BAD?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.648
I MEAN,
I'M HEART-BROKEN
FOR APRIL.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.549
I AM, I JUST--

16:23.582 --> 16:25.552
I GUESS FOR LEO,
IT JUST HASN'T HIT ME YET.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.721
I REMEMBER FOR ME,
IT KIND OF CAME IN
EBBS AND FLOWS.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.692
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE IMPORTANT
THING ISN'T ABOUT YOU CRYING,

16:32.725 --> 16:35.227
IT'S ABOUT BEING THE SHOULDER
THAT GETS CRIED ON.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.500
SEE YOU LATER.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.073
SO, I TALKED TO JOSH.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.009
HE SAID HE'S GONNA TRY TO BE
THERE TO INTRODUCE GEORGE
TO THE CLINICAL TRIAL LADY.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.611
GREAT.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.681
WHAT'S WRONG?
DID I GET THE WRONG THING?

16:54.713 --> 16:59.119
WHEN YOU GRABBED
MY MEDICAL RECORDS,
YOU GRABBED LEO'S, TOO.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.520
OH! OH! OKAY,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE THOSE TO ME.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.688
HERE, I CAN TAKE THEM.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.089
-GIVE ME THIS ONE.
-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.265
"TO BE OPENED
AFTER MY DEATH?"
IS THAT FROM LEO?

17:12.298 --> 17:13.566
IT'S HIS HANDWRITING.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.540
Beth: WHAT IS THAT?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.542
LOOKS LIKE...

17:23.576 --> 17:25.545
LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE
COORDINATES.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.079
SERIOUSLY?

17:27.113 --> 17:29.115
WHAT'S THE NUMBER
UNDERNEATH IT?

17:29.148 --> 17:30.583
A DATE MAYBE?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.453
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
APRIL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.688
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
WHERE IT GOES?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.525
WHY? TO FIND OUT HE HAS
A SECRET FAMILY, TOO?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.628
THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING THIS BY.
I'LL SEE YOU--

17:42.662 --> 17:45.464
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, APRIL.
PLEASE DON'T GO OUT THERE.
LOOK. LOOK. WAIT.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.800
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS?
I MEAN...

17:49.836 --> 17:51.136
(sighs)

17:52.605 --> 17:55.275
SEE, IT'S LONG WHARF.

17:55.307 --> 17:57.443
LEO WAS CLEARLY LEAVING
SOMETHING BEHIND.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.479
WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.257
SO, IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S HERE.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.325
WHAT'S HERE?

18:12.357 --> 18:14.227
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT?

18:22.335 --> 18:24.203
IT'S LOCKED.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.240
WAIT, WHAT WERE THOSE
NUMBERS AGAIN... THE ONES
WE THOUGHT COULD BE A DATE?

18:29.675 --> 18:32.377
UH... 4, 17, 22.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.217
IT WORKED!

18:40.286 --> 18:42.689
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.
IT'S LIFE JACKETS.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.624
CUT 'EM OPEN.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.558
WAIT, WHAT'S THIS?

18:46.593 --> 18:49.496
OH, THAT'S ONE OF THOSE
GEOCACHING TUBES.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.830
WHAT? I KEEP UP
ON CURRENT TRENDS.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.911
Leo:  IF YOU'VE FOUND THIS,
THEN CONGRATULATIONS!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.679
YOU KNOW HOW TO
USE THE INTERNET.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.781
SO LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT
"THIS" IS EXACTLY.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.786
A FEW DAYS AGO
MY ONCOLOGIST INFORMED ME
THAT I'M TERMINAL.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.888
I HAVE ABOUT SIX MONTHS
TO A YEAR LEFT.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.824
SEEING AS HOW I'M DYING,

19:17.856 --> 19:20.492
UNEMPLOYED AND RICH
I THOUGHT, WHY NOT
CREATE A SCAVENGER HUNT...

19:20.527 --> 19:21.928
FROM THE GRAVE!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.564
I MEAN, DEAD PIRATES LEFT
COOL STUFF BEHIND ALL THE TIME.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.532
MORE WILL BE REVEALED
AS THE SEARCH CONTINUES.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.433
SO PRESS ON,
ENTER INTO BATTLE

19:28.468 --> 19:30.636
AND DON'T FIRE UNTIL YOU SEE
THE WHITES OF THEIR EYES.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.238
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DID THIS.

19:32.271 --> 19:35.173
WELL, LEO NEVER DID
THINGS SMALL.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.510
SO, MAYBE OFF THAT CLUE
WE NEED TO GO LIKE,
SET SOMETHING ON FIRE!

19:38.545 --> 19:40.613
OH! NO, NO, NO.
WE NEED GO TO, LIKE,
AN EYE DOCTOR?

19:40.646 --> 19:42.515
NO, IT'S A QUOTE FROM
WILLIAM PRESCOTT,

19:42.548 --> 19:44.683
AND HIS STATUE IS
IN FRONT OF THE
HILL MONUMENT.

19:44.717 --> 19:49.322
WHAT? I'M JUST--
I'M A HUGE NERD.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.522
LET'S GET GOING.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.960
OKAY. LET'S GO
TO CHARLESTOWN.

19:54.192 --> 19:58.597
SO MY BEST TIME
FOR THE 200 IS 22.25.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.632
IT'S WHAT I'M
LOOKING TO BEAT.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.867
-TODAY?
-(chuckles) NO.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.635
OF COURSE NOT TODAY.
IN A MONTH.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.804
SO WE GOT OUT WORK
CUT OUT FOR US.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.638
HAVE YOU BEEN
TRAINING A LOT?

20:06.673 --> 20:09.241
WELL, I HAVEN'T SET FOOT...
PUN-INTENDED.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.577
...ON THE TRACK SINCE
MY STEM CELL TRANSPLANT.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.446
HEY, DID I EVER TELL YOU
THAT I DONATED STEM CELLS.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.749
WELL, ON BEHALF
OF ALL THE RECIPIENTS
THE WORLD OVER, I THANK YOU.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.727
YOU CAN TOUCH IT
IF YOU WANT...

20:27.759 --> 20:28.928
AND I MEAN MY LEG.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.630
THAT'S OKAY.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.335
SO DO I NEED A STOPWATCH
OR SOMETHING?

20:35.367 --> 20:37.670
NO, I'M JUST LOOKING TO RUN
THIS WITHOUT STOPPING.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.638
Brenna: OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.708
ON YOUR MARK!
GET SET! GO!

20:50.415 --> 20:51.683
-(groans)
-FINN!

20:59.826 --> 21:01.594
-ARE YOU OKAY?
-I'M FINE.

21:03.528 --> 21:04.730
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:04.763 --> 21:06.633
GETTING BACK
ON THE LINE.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.601
ARE YOU SURE
YOU SHOULD BE
DOING THIS?

21:08.634 --> 21:09.769
GOTTA START SOMEWHERE.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.838
WELL, YOU STARTED
REALLY FAST. GREAT JOB!

21:12.872 --> 21:14.374
STOP, BRENNA.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.844
I DON'T NEED A CHEERLEADER.
I NEED A DRILL SERGEANT.

21:17.876 --> 21:20.445
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I JUST--

21:20.480 --> 21:24.651
I'M WORRIED THAT YOU'RE
SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR
LIKE, IMPOSSIBLE GOALS.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.586
WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.554
IMPOSSIBLE GOALS...

21:28.587 --> 21:30.589
AND I DON'T GET
THE IMPRESSION
YOU BELIEVE I CAN.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.858
-YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.
-WHY?

21:32.892 --> 21:35.827
SO IT CAN DRAG ME DOWN?
I DON'T WORK LIKE THAT.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.763
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, OKAY?

21:45.337 --> 21:48.540
SO I THINK
ALL OF APRIL'S MEDICAL
INFORMATION IS IN THERE.

21:48.574 --> 21:51.644
SHE AND BETH TOOK OFF
IN SUCH A HURRY AND I CAN'T
REACH HER ON THE PHONE.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.378
WELL, I'LL TAKE
WHAT I CAN GET.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.048
GREAT. THEN LET'S GO.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.417
UH... WELL, FAMILIES
ARE NOT REALLY ALLOWED
IN THESE DISCUSSIONS.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.586
WELL, YOU'RE FAMILY,
AND WHAT IF THEY HAVE
QUESTIONS?

22:01.653 --> 22:03.789
THE ONLY QUESTIONS
THEY'RE GONNA ASK
ARE SCIENTIFIC ONES.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.724
CLINICAL TRIALS ARE
ABOUT THE RESEARCH.

22:05.758 --> 22:09.528
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
THE PATIENT AND NOT THE PERSON.
BUT THAT GENOME SAMPLING

22:09.561 --> 22:11.830
SAID THAT THIS TRIAL
COULD SAVE APRIL'S LIFE.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.900
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON,

22:13.932 --> 22:16.635
I CAN'T WAIT HERE, IF THERE'S
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT
I COULD HELP IN SOME WAY.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.904
IF YOU DON'T NEED ME,
I WILL SIT THERE QUIETLY,
I PROMISE.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.941
THEN LET'S GO.

22:33.618 --> 22:34.886
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

22:34.921 --> 22:35.922
NO, NOT YET.

22:40.358 --> 22:42.795
IT'S NICE TO BE OUT
OF YOUR ROOM, ISN'T IT?

22:42.828 --> 22:45.064
I MEAN, YOU SPEND
A LOT OF TIME IN THERE.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.665
I GUESS.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.871
HEY, BETH...

22:51.903 --> 22:55.607
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING
THAT I FEEL LIKE I CAN
REALLY ONLY TELL YOU?

22:55.641 --> 22:56.875
THAT'S WHAT WE DO,
ISN'T IT?

22:59.746 --> 23:01.814
SINCE LEO DIED,

23:01.847 --> 23:03.115
I'VE BEEN
TALKING TO HIM.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.884
PLEASE DON'T THINK
I'M CRAZY.

23:04.916 --> 23:07.586
I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK I'M CRAZY.

23:07.619 --> 23:09.922
WELL, THAT'S WHAT CRAZY
PEOPLE SAY, ISN'T IT?

23:09.955 --> 23:11.824
IT JUST HELPS,
YOU KNOW,

23:11.857 --> 23:14.826
IMAGINING HE'S WITH ME.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.763
WHAT HE WOULD SAY.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.932
SOMETIMES IT'S--

23:19.965 --> 23:22.401
I CAN ALMOST FEEL HIM.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.605
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IN THE WORDS OF
SHERYL CROW,

23:25.637 --> 23:27.773
"IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY."

23:27.807 --> 23:30.009
-DID YOU REALLY JUST
QUOTE SHERYL CROW?
-WELL, YOU KNOW,

23:30.041 --> 23:32.177
SHE AND I HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.047
WE'VE BOTH HAD CANCER TOUCH
OUR LIVES THROUGH A LOVED ONE.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.016
YOU KNOW SHE HAD
CANCER, TOO, RIGHT?

23:37.048 --> 23:39.184
YEAH, WHICH MAKES HER
EVEN MORE OF A BADASS.

23:41.119 --> 23:42.755
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO LOOK.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.691
HEY, APE...

23:45.724 --> 23:47.894
I HAVE TO ASK
THE QUESTION...

23:47.926 --> 23:49.796
WHAT IF WE DON'T
FIND ANYTHING?

23:51.730 --> 23:53.566
WE CAN'T GIVE UP
SO QUICKLY.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.102
I JUST--
I JUST MEAN THAT

23:56.134 --> 23:58.604
IT'S NOT LIKE LEO LEFT
THAT FIRST ENVELOPE
WHERE HE WANTED YOU

23:58.637 --> 24:01.574
OR ANYONE REALLY TO FIND IT.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.742
I MEAN, WHAT IF HE NEVER
FINISHED THE SCAVENGER HUNT?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.845
I MEAN, WE CAN KEEP
LOOKING. I JUST...

24:05.877 --> 24:10.583
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MIGHT
NEED TO GIVE UP, MOVE ON.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.018
JUST KEEP
LOOKING, OKAY?

24:17.522 --> 24:20.026
HEY, APE, I THINK
I FOUND SOMETHING.

24:22.728 --> 24:23.762
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.498
HOW DO WE GET IT OUT?

24:25.530 --> 24:26.932
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

24:26.965 --> 24:28.800
THAT SUCKER'S BEEN IN THERE
FOR A LONG TIME FOR A REASON.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.102
IT'S NOT COMING
OFF THAT EASILY.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.704
BESIDES, RIPPING IT OFF
PROBABLY BREAKS A LAW OR TWO.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.707
THEN LET'S BREAK
A LAW OR TWO.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.474
HEY, APE,

24:36.509 --> 24:39.478
I HAVE AN IDEA, OKAY?
WE NEED TOOLS OR
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

24:40.546 --> 24:41.747
(sighs) YEAH.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.249
LET ME TEXT SOMEONE.
I KNOW A GUY IN THE AREA.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.528
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.598
WE NEED TOOLS. DOM LIVES
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.
IT WAS A NO-BRAINER.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.567
HEY, DOM. THANKS
FOR MEETING US.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.171
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:05.203 --> 25:07.839
WELL, WE'RE ON LEO'S
PRE-DEATH SCAVENGER HUNT...

25:07.874 --> 25:10.209
AND WE THINK A CLUE IS
STUCK BEHIND THAT PLAQUE.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.646
HEY, COME ON.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.182
COME ON.

25:18.784 --> 25:19.652
OKAY.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.256
I CAN'T REMOVE IT.

25:23.288 --> 25:26.625
MAYBE I CAN SLIDE THAT
PLASTIC OUT WITH SOME
PLIERS OR SOMETHING.

25:29.628 --> 25:30.829
OH, DON'T MIND US.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.530
WE'RE JUST, UM...

25:32.565 --> 25:33.965
-CITY WORKERS.
-RIGHT.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.602
TIMES ARE TOUGH
FOR OUR GENERATION.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.671
WE TAKE THE WORK
WHERE WE CAN GET IT.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.740
AH, GUYS,
I GOT IT.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.308
JUST A BUNCH OF NUMBERS.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.943
Beth: GOD, MORE NUMBERS?

25:44.977 --> 25:47.712
NO, THIS IS A PICTURE
OF A ROOM NUMBER
AT MASS MEDICAL.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.115
I KNOW THAT FONT
ALL TOO WELL.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.250
-I'M GONNA GO GET US A CAB.
-OKAY.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.086
THAT'S MY CUE.
GOOD LUCK.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.155
OH, NO, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, PLEASE.
YOU CAN'T GO.

25:57.189 --> 26:00.926
APRIL'S IN A REALLY WEIRD PLACE
AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO HANDLE
HER OR THIS SITUATION.

26:03.261 --> 26:04.663
ARE YOU GUYS
COMING OR NOT?

26:06.632 --> 26:07.967
COME ON.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.602
ALL RIGHT.

26:09.634 --> 26:10.769
(knock on door)

26:10.803 --> 26:12.738
JOSH, HI.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.640
GEORGE CARVER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.209
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY
MY CONNECTIONS HERE
ARE PRETTY TENUOUS.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.746
I KNOW A REP WHO WORKS
WITH A DOCTOR WHO--
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.682
BUT YOU GOT 10 MINUTES.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.817
I'M APRIL'S MOM SARA.

26:24.849 --> 26:26.318
-OH, HI.
-HI.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.154
SHE PROMISES
TO STAY QUIET.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.724
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP, JOSH.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.695
OH, WELL, THIS TRIAL IS
JUST BRANCHING OUTSIDE OF
PANCREATIC CANCER AND IS

26:36.729 --> 26:38.364
PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE
RIGHT NOW.

26:38.596 --> 26:42.000
AND THIS PRINCIPAL
INVESTIGATOR ISN'T KNOWN
FOR HER SENSITIVITY.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.635
HI.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.171
OH, HI.
IT'S A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU.

26:45.203 --> 26:46.638
WE KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.673
UH, YEAH. WHO'S THIS?

26:48.708 --> 26:50.643
-I'M--
-THIS IS THE MOTHER
OF OUR PATIENT.

26:50.675 --> 26:53.311
SHE'S HERE IN
A SUPPLEMENTAL
CAPACITY, ONLY,

26:53.346 --> 26:54.814
SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS ABOUT APRIL.

26:54.846 --> 26:56.615
I DON'T THINK
I'LL HAVE MANY.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.616
AML, RIGHT?

26:58.651 --> 27:02.755
George: YES, AND SINCE YOUR
TRIAL IS BRANCHING OUT,

27:02.788 --> 27:04.690
SHE WOULD MAKE
AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE.

27:04.723 --> 27:08.693
BUT OUR OUTSIDE SAMPLING
OF AML PATIENTS HAS REACHED
ITS CAPACITY,

27:08.728 --> 27:12.030
SO, UNLESS YOUR SUBJECT
OFFERS SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT
ADVANCEMENT IN MY RESEARCH--

27:12.064 --> 27:13.766
WELL, THAT'S PRECISELY
WHY WE'RE HERE

27:13.798 --> 27:16.201
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THAT APRIL DOES.

27:16.234 --> 27:19.337
SO IF YOU'LL
JUST ALLOW ME

27:19.372 --> 27:22.173
TO TAKE YOU THROUGH
THE SPECIFICS OF HER CASE.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.659
(whispering)
THERE IS SOMEONE
IN THERE.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.994
-WHAT DO WE DO?
-WE WING IT.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.131
COME ON.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.701
GOOD AFTERNOON.

27:48.733 --> 27:52.704
AND HOW ARE WE
FEELING TODAY,
MRS. LAWN?

27:52.738 --> 27:54.272
BETTER, THANK YOU.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.673
WHO ARE YOU?

27:55.708 --> 27:58.076
WE'RE QUALITY
ASSURANCE SPECIALISTS.

27:58.109 --> 27:59.944
-ALL THREE OF YOU?
-YEAH.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.281
WE'RE HIRED BY THE HOSPITAL.
WE GO ROOM TO ROOM JUST
CHECKING ON EVERYONE.

28:03.315 --> 28:06.451
YOU KNOW, TO ENSURE
YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR EXPERIENCE
HERE AT MASS MEDICAL.

28:06.684 --> 28:10.288
DO YOU MIND IF WE LOOK AROUND,
MAKE SURE YOUR ROOM IS UP TO
THE HIGH STANDARD WE EXPECT?

28:10.321 --> 28:13.025
SO LONG AS YOU KEEP ME
COMPANY, WHILE THEY DO.

28:16.828 --> 28:20.098
WELL, I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE BATHROOM.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.268
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.136
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-IT'S DOMINIC.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.940
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW'S
NAMED DOMINIC.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.709
OH, THAT'S NICE.

28:33.778 --> 28:34.814
(grunts)

28:37.383 --> 28:38.817
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:42.387 --> 28:43.489
(sobbing)

28:43.721 --> 28:44.824
I BROKE A NAIL.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.826
SHE REALLY CARES
ABOUT HER NAILS.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.133
EXCUSE US.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.106
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

29:01.140 --> 29:03.476
AFTER GRAHAM BROKE UP
WITH ME, I WAS...

29:04.509 --> 29:07.813
GOD, I WAS SO DEPRESSED,
AND LEO,

29:07.846 --> 29:10.782
HE DROPPED
EVERYTHING AND...

29:12.750 --> 29:15.421
HE WENT AND GOT
A MANI-PEDI WITH ME.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.323
I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT?

29:17.355 --> 29:19.391
HE WAS...

29:19.424 --> 29:22.127
HE WAS SO INCREDIBLE...

29:22.161 --> 29:24.195
AND NOW HE'S GONE...

29:26.097 --> 29:27.266
FOREVER.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.505
I'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.807
APRIL WILL NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.342
YEAH.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.876
YEAH.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.377
-I KNOW.
-(sobbing)

29:39.411 --> 29:43.015
I KNOW, BUT WE GOT
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER
FOR HER, RIGHT NOW.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.085
LAST TIME I SAW THE GUY...

29:46.117 --> 29:48.787
I PUNCHED HIM.
I FEEL SICK.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.522
BUT WE CAN'T SHOW
ANY OF THAT TO HER
RIGHT NOW.

29:52.223 --> 29:53.992
-OKAY?
-YEAH.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.528
-YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
-YEAH?

29:58.497 --> 30:00.499
HEY, GUYS,
EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:00.532 --> 30:02.268
YEAH, TOTALLY.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.202
SHE BROKE A NAIL.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.305
OKAY, I FOUND
THE NEXT CLUE.

30:06.337 --> 30:09.575
HE HIT IT IN THE ACTUAL
BATHROOM LIGHT FIXTURE.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.009
IT'S A RIDDLE.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.578
WHAT'S FOUND ALL OVER
THE HOSPITAL? GO THERE.

30:13.811 --> 30:15.914
UH... GERMS.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.883
HOW DO YOU GO
TO GERMS?

30:17.916 --> 30:19.852
WHAT ABOUT DOCTORS?
PATIENTS?

30:19.884 --> 30:22.320
NO, IT'S A RIDDLE,
SO IT WON'T BE SO
LITERAL.

30:23.821 --> 30:25.089
IT'S ALL OVER...

30:27.125 --> 30:28.294
"THE ROOF."

30:35.567 --> 30:37.469
OKAY, TIME TO
HYDRATE, MADILL.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.104
THANKS, COACH.

30:39.137 --> 30:42.508
IT WASN'T MY BEST DAY,
BUT WHO SAYS TOMORROW
WON'T BE.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.044
WELL, I HOPE I WAS
SOMEWHAT HELPFUL

30:45.076 --> 30:47.046
BECAUSE I GOTTA BE HONEST,

30:47.078 --> 30:51.016
BETWEEN YOU AND MY SISTER,
I'M FEELING PRETTY USELESS
THESE DAYS.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.219
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.587
NO, I'M SORRY FOR
DISCOURAGING YOU.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.557
YOU DIDN'T. I JUST
RAN AN ENTIRE 400 WHILE
YOU WERE GETTING WATER.

30:58.590 --> 30:59.991
WHAT? YOU DID?

31:00.025 --> 31:02.428
NO, BUT YOU BELIEVED IT
FOR A SECOND.

31:03.494 --> 31:05.431
IT'S NOT SO HARD
TO HAVE FAITH, IS IT?

31:07.031 --> 31:09.867
REMEMBER EARLIER YOU SAID
YOU THOUGHT LEO WAS JUST
IN THE GROUND?

31:11.103 --> 31:13.172
DO YOU REALLY NOT
BELIEVE IN AN AFTERLIFE?

31:13.204 --> 31:14.873
BUT YOU DO?

31:14.906 --> 31:16.141
I DO.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.878
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S ALL
A LITTLE EASY, ISN'T IT?

31:20.913 --> 31:22.914
HEAVEN AND HELL,

31:22.948 --> 31:24.383
GOOD AND EVIL.

31:24.415 --> 31:26.050
I'M SURPRISED SOMEONE

31:26.085 --> 31:28.019
WHO HATES LABELS
AND IS BISEXUAL

31:28.053 --> 31:31.423
IS SO QUICK TO DISMISS
SOMETHING IN SUCH BLACK
AND WHITE TERMS.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.425
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
FOR YOU TO THINK THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE SICK.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.128
-I DON'T KNOW.
-RIGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW.

31:37.162 --> 31:40.499
FOR SURE, NOBODY
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DIE.

31:40.531 --> 31:42.634
-LEO KNOWS.
-EXACTLY.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.570
AND DOESN'T THAT MAKE
YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER
ABOUT LIFE?

31:45.604 --> 31:49.642
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WAITING
FOR US AFTER ALL THIS?

31:49.674 --> 31:51.910
SOMETHING AMAZING?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.048
SURE.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.915
IT'S COMFORTING, I GUESS.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.917
WHY NOT TAKE
THAT COMFORT?

32:01.319 --> 32:03.622
I MEAN, IF I DIE
AND I'M WRONG,

32:03.655 --> 32:05.657
IT'S NOT GONNA
MATTER, BUT...

32:07.159 --> 32:09.228
WHILE I'M ALIVE,

32:09.260 --> 32:10.628
I'LL TAKE THAT COMFORT.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.166
LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH
AS IT IS WITHOUT IT.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.548
AND SHE WAS IN REMISSION
FOR OVER TWO MONTHS
BEFORE HER RELAPSE.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.419
SHE'S YOUNG,
SHE'S STRONG,

32:33.451 --> 32:36.689
AND AS YOU CAN SEE
FROM THE RESULTS OF
HER GENOME SAMPLING,

32:36.721 --> 32:40.726
SHE'S LIKELY NOT ONLY TO RESPOND
WELL TO YOUR TRIAL, BUT ALSO
TO HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT

32:40.959 --> 32:43.595
ON POTENTIALLY EXPANDING
IT TO THE AML MARKET.

32:43.628 --> 32:47.231
MY HANDS ARE TIED BY THE
REGULATIONS OF THIS TRAIL,
DR. CARVER, YOU KNOW THAT.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.435
I HAVE THREE SLOTS FOR
LEUKEMIA IN MY TRIAL.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.005
TWO OF WHICH
ARE ALREADY OCCUPIED
BY OTHER YOUNG SUBJECTS.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.476
I'M SORRY.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.546
-SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS--
-George: SARA...

33:00.578 --> 33:03.648
-SARA, DON'T--
-NO, I'M SORRY, DR. LIN, BUT--

33:03.682 --> 33:06.018
SCREW YOUR REGULATIONS.
MY DAUGHTER NEEDS YOUR HELP.

33:06.050 --> 33:08.420
CAN'T YOU GIVE US
SOME HOPE?

33:08.453 --> 33:11.289
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M UNAWARE OF HOW MANY
PATIENTS I HAVE TO TURN AWAY

33:11.323 --> 33:13.057
AND IN DOING SO,
THEY MIGHT LIKELY DIE?

33:13.092 --> 33:16.595
EVERY DAY I AM FACED
WITH THE FACT THAT
THE TITANIC IS SINKING,

33:16.627 --> 33:19.263
AND I HAPPEN TO BE THE CAPTAIN
OF ONE OF THE LAST LIFEBOATS.

33:20.298 --> 33:22.634
AND IF I LET EVERYONE IN
THAT LIFEBOAT, WE ALL DIE.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.070
SO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
SWATTING AWAY THOSE IN
THE WATER TO LET THEM DROWN

33:26.105 --> 33:28.640
IN ORDER TO SAVE
THE LIVES OF OTHERS.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.608
I HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE'S
PLEAS ON MY CONSCIENCE.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.344
I DO NOT NEED ONE MORE.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.680
WHAT ABOUT
A DIFFERENT LIFEBOAT?

33:34.712 --> 33:36.582
Josh: HOW ABOUT
NORATIS, DR. LIN?

33:36.615 --> 33:38.349
AREN'T THEY DEVELOPING
A SIMILAR DRUG?

33:38.384 --> 33:41.586
-THEY'RE PHASE ONE.
-I HEARD THEY'RE ABOUT
TO GO PHASE TWO...

33:41.619 --> 33:44.655
AND MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE
IN THE KINDS OF PATIENTS THAT
THEY'RE WILLING TO ADMIT.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.608
WE USED TO COME
UP HERE TOGETHER.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.743
HE LOVED ROOFTOPS.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.586
Leo:  I WENT ON THE ROOF
OF MY BUILDING EVERY NIGHT

34:15.621 --> 34:17.523
AND I WOULD LOOK OUT
AT THE CITY

34:17.556 --> 34:19.824
AND THINK ABOUT
ALL THE THINGS I WAS
GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.695
IF YOU WERE TO FALL OFF
THIS ROOF RIGHT NOW,

34:23.728 --> 34:25.630
WHAT REGRETS WOULD YOU HAVE?

34:25.664 --> 34:28.699
I MEAN, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO FOCUS ON.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.802
APE...

34:29.835 --> 34:32.771
HE LIVED MORE THAN
ANYONE I EVER KNEW.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.208
I MEAN, HE REALLY LEFT
EVERYTHING ON THE FIELD,
DIDN'T HE?

34:38.643 --> 34:40.813
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
HE CAME INTO YOUR LIFE

34:40.846 --> 34:42.581
EXACTLY WHEN
YOU NEEDED HIM,

34:42.614 --> 34:44.315
MORE THAN ANYONE
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.684
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

34:54.827 --> 34:56.260
DOM, I'M SORRY.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.297
WE'RE GOOD, OKAY?

35:00.632 --> 35:02.300
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.769
LET'S FIND THIS NEXT CLUE.

35:04.802 --> 35:07.773
THERE AREN'T TOO MANY
PLACES TO HIDE ANYTHING
UP HERE.

35:09.708 --> 35:10.876
HEY, HEY.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.445
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.215
OKAY?

35:21.753 --> 35:23.655
FOUND SOMETHING.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.195
"YOU'VE REACHED
THE END OF YOUR
JOURNEY.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.231
"NOW GO TO WHERE
MY JOURNEY WILL END

35:33.264 --> 35:35.367
AND CLIMB THE BOUGHS
OF THE TREE OF LIFE."

35:35.400 --> 35:38.536
YEAH. I SAW THAT
TREE AT THE CEMETERY.

35:38.570 --> 35:42.139
THIS IS IT,
THIS IS THE LAST CLUE.

35:42.173 --> 35:43.208
NO.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.579
(voice breaking) THANK YOU
GUYS FOR EVERYTHING,
BUT I'M GONNA GO HOME.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.248
BUT WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.648
I DON'T WANT TO BE DONE.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.552
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE OVER

35:54.585 --> 35:56.255
BECAUSE WHEN THIS IS OVER,

35:56.288 --> 35:59.224
I HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT LEO'S GONE...

35:59.257 --> 36:01.592
FOREVER.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.461
I'M NOT READY.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.766
I NEED HIM.
I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT HIM.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.168
I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT HIM.

36:12.271 --> 36:16.541
I...
I SLEPT THERE
NEXT TO HIM,

36:16.574 --> 36:21.246
WHILE HE DIED AND I
WASN'T THERE FOR HIM,

36:21.280 --> 36:23.315
NOT THE WAY
HE WAS THERE FOR ME.

36:24.750 --> 36:28.320
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT HAVING A FAMILY

36:28.353 --> 36:30.722
TALKING ABOUT OUR
FUTURE TOGETHER...

36:30.755 --> 36:33.791
I DON'T HAVE ONE
WITHOUT HIM.

36:33.824 --> 36:35.927
I DON'T WANT ONE.

36:37.663 --> 36:41.400

TO GO HOME.

COME ON.

37:04.989 --> 37:07.259
SO I GOTTA ASK...

37:07.291 --> 37:08.793
WHAT'S AT THE END
OF THE SCAVENGER HUNT?

37:10.695 --> 37:13.264
IT'S A SECRET.

37:13.297 --> 37:15.934
KNOWING YOU,
IT'S PROBABLY
SOMETHING STUPID.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.737
IT'S PIRATE'S BOOTY,
ISN'T IT?

37:18.769 --> 37:20.472
THAT'S WHAT
I SHOULD'VE DONE.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.775
WHY PUT SOMEONE
THROUGH ALL THIS
TROUBLE?

37:23.809 --> 37:26.311
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S STUPID.

THE FUTURE IS NOT LIVING.

37:31.882 --> 37:34.820
