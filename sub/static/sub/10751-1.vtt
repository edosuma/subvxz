00:31.782 --> 00:34.284
I could have brought it in tomorrow,
you know.

00:34.294 --> 00:36.453
You didn't have to
follow me home.

00:36.463 --> 00:38.664
Jen, I know what it's
like lending money,

00:38.674 --> 00:40.999
you do not want it
hanging over you,

00:41.009 --> 00:44.628
it's better I get it back now before
it becomes this big thing between us.

00:44.638 --> 00:46.380
You gave it to me
two hours ago,

00:46.390 --> 00:49.341
and you literally haven't
left my side since.

00:49.351 --> 00:53.220
I am never going to borrow money
off you again, you're a nightmare.

00:53.238 --> 00:56.390
There, five pounds, God.

00:56.405 --> 00:57.594
Thanking you.

00:57.605 --> 00:58.225
Hi, Jen.

00:58.234 --> 01:00.069
Oh, Gary, hi, how's it going?

01:00.079 --> 01:02.062
Oh, good, yeah.
I've, er, finished that first wall.

01:02.075 --> 01:03.642
Oh, great, that was quick.

01:03.658 --> 01:05.940
Gary's doing a bit of
work around the house.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.900
Hello.

01:07.916 --> 01:10.272
Have we met?

01:10.286 --> 01:12.363
Er, no, I, I don't think so.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.530
You just look, oh...

01:14.547 --> 01:16.860
I'd better crack on, eh?

01:16.875 --> 01:18.490
OK, bye, Roy.

01:18.507 --> 01:20.620
Yeah, all right, time to go.

01:20.638 --> 01:22.082
Listen, I don't think...

01:22.098 --> 01:23.410
Get out.

01:23.426 --> 01:24.912
Oh, no, wait, Jen, wait!

01:24.925 --> 01:26.871
It can wait till tomorrow!

01:50.156 --> 01:52.150
Why didn't you tell
me this last night?

01:52.165 --> 01:53.230
You wouldn't let me.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.570
Builders From Hell?

01:54.586 --> 01:57.531
I'm pretty sure it was
one of those programmes.

01:58.665 --> 02:00.620
Gary's a Builder From Hell?

02:00.636 --> 02:01.051
I think so.

02:01.105 --> 02:02.050
Oh, so you're not sure?

02:02.095 --> 02:04.332
Jen, I'm 99% sure.

02:04.347 --> 02:06.710
Oh, what did he do?

02:06.727 --> 02:10.169
The work was fine,
there was nothing wrong with the work,

02:10.185 --> 02:14.170
but then they caught him...

02:17.726 --> 02:19.643
He pissed in the sink.

02:22.606 --> 02:23.602
Which sink?

02:23.617 --> 02:24.561
All the sinks.

02:25.935 --> 02:28.773
Yeah, he basically went on a
pee parade around the house.

02:28.786 --> 02:30.231
Oh, God, I have to fire him.

02:30.247 --> 02:33.983
I think you should, yeah,
I'm 95% sure it was him.

02:35.618 --> 02:38.363
Y-You said you were 99% sure.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.952
I'm 97% sure it was him.

02:41.418 --> 02:44.121
I have to get home.
I have to get home.

02:47.505 --> 02:48.912
Hey, man.

02:52.966 --> 02:54.003
You OK?

02:54.018 --> 02:55.382
Yeah.

02:55.397 --> 02:56.421
You sure?

02:56.438 --> 02:57.383
Yeah.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.970
Wait, was it those
bullies again?

03:04.517 --> 03:05.893
Yeah.

03:07.068 --> 03:08.813
Oh, what do they do, exactly?

03:08.826 --> 03:11.601
They make hurtful
comments, Roy.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.520
You have to learn how to
stand up for yourself, man.

03:15.538 --> 03:19.001
OK, let's try something.
Let's do some role play, OK?

03:19.017 --> 03:20.581
Do you think that
would be a good idea?

03:20.626 --> 03:23.950
It certainly helped me
learn how to buy sandwiches.

03:26.497 --> 03:31.251
Ah, let's go for it, OK.
So I'll be those bullies on the bench.

03:31.268 --> 03:32.423
What, all of them?

03:33.637 --> 03:34.880
No, just one of them.

03:34.898 --> 03:35.961
Which one?

03:35.976 --> 03:37.880
I don't know them, Moss.

03:37.896 --> 03:42.302
I'm a bully on the bench and you're
going to walk past me, but this time,

03:42.316 --> 03:46.892
after I make a hurtful comment,
come back at me with something.

03:46.905 --> 03:48.932
OK, get all up in my shit.

03:51.107 --> 03:54.482
Right, OK. Oh, no, no, wait, wait,
wait, what do they usually say?

03:54.497 --> 03:57.523
They mention my glasses.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.283
OK, let's start with that.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.412
Them glasses is shit, innit!

04:08.416 --> 04:11.292
It's too real, Roy,
it's too real.

04:11.306 --> 04:13.420
I won't do the voice,
I won't do the voice.

04:13.437 --> 04:14.632
Thank you.

04:20.016 --> 04:21.380
Nice glasses.

04:21.396 --> 04:22.473
Oh, yeah,

04:22.486 --> 04:26.761
er, maybe the reason
I have to wear glasses

04:26.778 --> 04:29.810
is because I suffer
from short-sightedness

04:29.825 --> 04:32.600
and I can't, I won't,
I can't put contact lenses in

04:32.617 --> 04:35.441
cos I'm frightened
of touching my eyes.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.192
There's no way that,
that these glasses...

04:42.786 --> 04:44.243
Yeah.

04:49.128 --> 04:50.661
Stupid hair.

04:54.416 --> 04:57.631
I just think, Mr Reynholm,
you seem to lack a basic understanding

04:57.647 --> 05:00.133
of exactly how much
trouble this company's in.

05:00.146 --> 05:03.341
We have a financial crisis here and,
if you don't mind me saying,

05:03.357 --> 05:06.131
your attitude seems to
me incredibly cavalier.

05:06.146 --> 05:09.012
What?

05:09.028 --> 05:12.720
I can't hear you. Can't you
see we're having an iPod party?

05:12.738 --> 05:14.312
Mr Reynholm, please!

05:14.326 --> 05:16.900
What?

05:16.918 --> 05:18.861
Sorry, girls, you'd better go.

05:22.445 --> 05:24.363
Girls, ship it!

05:31.417 --> 05:34.750
Best accounting
team I've ever had.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.083
What's your problem?

05:36.096 --> 05:39.083
This is the problem -
the iPod parties are the problem,

05:39.095 --> 05:42.051
the gold flakes in the drinking
water are the problem.

05:43.387 --> 05:45.671
The obscene amount you
spend on erotic art.

05:45.688 --> 05:47.263
Easy there, that's an original.

05:49.095 --> 05:51.140
Do you know how much
trouble we're in?

05:51.156 --> 05:53.642
Do you know what the
shareholders will do with us?

05:55.487 --> 05:57.730
I'm sorry but you were
getting hysterical.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.023
No, I wasn't!

05:59.038 --> 06:00.441
You seemed hysterical.

06:00.458 --> 06:01.110
No!

06:01.127 --> 06:04.443
Anyway, don't worry about the
shareholders, I can handle them.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.742
But you've missed every meeting with
them. Where were you last time?

06:07.756 --> 06:11.870
You're going to hate me for this,
but I fancied the day off,

06:11.887 --> 06:15.041
so, er, I took some of the
pension money out of the bank,

06:15.056 --> 06:17.583
and I lost it on a horse!

06:17.595 --> 06:19.480
Yes.

06:19.497 --> 06:21.350
You were gambling with
our employees' pensions?

06:21.396 --> 06:22.793
Gambling? No, no, no, no.

06:22.807 --> 06:25.172
I was riding a horse and
it fell out of my pocket.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.720
Oh, my God.

06:26.738 --> 06:28.381
I'm not hysterical!

06:35.647 --> 06:36.683
Hi, Gary.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.563
Oh, hello.

06:38.575 --> 06:40.480
I thought I'd work
from home today.

06:41.947 --> 06:44.400
Sorry, bit out of breath.

06:47.996 --> 06:51.161
Hope you don't mind.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.911
No, not at all.

07:00.297 --> 07:05.892
I'm sorry to interrupt you but you said
you had a problem with your laptop.

07:05.907 --> 07:08.442
You don't mind if IT fiddle about
a bit while we speak, do you?

07:08.486 --> 07:09.593
Well, actually I...

07:09.606 --> 07:12.890
Yeah, no, good.
Er, I can't seem to get it open.

07:15.647 --> 07:18.140
You want me to open it?

07:18.156 --> 07:21.940
That's why you called me all the
way up here, to open your laptop?

07:21.955 --> 07:25.150
I would be beholden to you.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.862
No problem.

07:30.877 --> 07:34.533
I do think the delicate
nature of our conversation...

07:34.546 --> 07:37.160
Yeah, money, money, money.

07:37.177 --> 07:41.042
That's the problem with you people,
it's always about money.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.832
Roy, give me £20.

07:44.337 --> 07:45.423
What?

07:45.437 --> 07:47.303
Give me £20, I'll pay you back.

07:48.925 --> 07:49.922
Yeah.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.723
You know what I think of money?

07:57.438 --> 08:00.562
That's what I think of money.
Ah, you've opened it.

08:02.486 --> 08:03.520
Thanks, Roy.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.040
You're welcome.

08:32.147 --> 08:34.520
Mr Reynholm, you do know that
Japan have expressed concern?

08:34.565 --> 08:37.054
What, the whole country?

08:37.895 --> 08:39.895
No, not the whole...

08:39.904 --> 08:41.149
Mr Yamamoto.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.100
Oh, he's important, isn't he?

08:43.115 --> 08:46.520
He's the major shareholder,
he's effectively your partner,

08:46.537 --> 08:47.863
and he said, what he said,

08:47.878 --> 08:51.442
"I do hope we don't have our own
Conrad Black at Reynholm Industries."

08:51.458 --> 08:57.820
Conrad Black, the first rich person
to go to prison in 300 years.

08:57.835 --> 08:58.991
You see it's serious.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.293
What do you want from me?

09:00.306 --> 09:01.990
I just want you to
stay out of trouble,

09:01.905 --> 09:03.592
just do nothing until the
conference call tomorrow.

09:03.635 --> 09:05.791
Let me get this right,

09:05.908 --> 09:11.673
you want me to do
absolutely nothing?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.381
Just stay out of trouble,
that's all I ask.

09:13.398 --> 09:17.010
You want me to sit
on my arse all day?

09:18.605 --> 09:20.763
I think I can handle that.

09:27.778 --> 09:31.020
I don't think I've ever
looked in this drawer.

09:33.408 --> 09:35.200
Wow, a gun!

09:45.088 --> 09:48.003
Roy, I'd like to take you
to the changes I've made

09:48.088 --> 09:50.293
to the video conference
system in the meeting room

09:51.218 --> 09:52.751
but maybe I'm boring you.

09:52.765 --> 09:55.421
I'm never going to
see that £20 again.

09:55.438 --> 09:57.930
I can't believe you're not
interested in the sweet flip switch

09:57.946 --> 09:59.930
I've installed in case
the first feed goes down.

09:59.948 --> 10:05.141
£20 doesn't even register to
him as an amount of money.

10:05.157 --> 10:06.600
He won't remember it.

10:09.488 --> 10:11.323
Hello, IT,
have you tried turning it...?

10:11.338 --> 10:12.443
Is this the guy?

10:12.456 --> 10:16.243
I need to know,
I can't sit here all day staring at him.

10:16.258 --> 10:20.700
It really looked like him,
Jen, I'm 80% sure it's him.

10:20.717 --> 10:22.412
Are you winding me up?

10:22.428 --> 10:23.450
'Why?'

10:23.467 --> 10:25.252
You've gone down 15%.

10:25.267 --> 10:27.000
It's still high.

10:27.015 --> 10:30.293
I'm sitting here like an idiot
trying to think of things to do

10:30.308 --> 10:32.091
and you've gone down about 15%.

10:32.106 --> 10:34.173
Oh, Jen, Jen,
how can you be keeping an eye on him

10:34.187 --> 10:35.710
while you're talking
to me as well?

10:54.075 --> 10:55.280
Hi, Gary.

10:55.295 --> 10:56.320
What?

10:56.336 --> 11:00.703
Sorry, I thought you
were in the toilet,

11:00.718 --> 11:05.081
I just wondered, er,
if you fancied a cup of tea.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.791
Just made you one.

11:06.806 --> 11:09.372
Oh, yeah, thanks.

11:15.887 --> 11:17.260
So how's it all going?

11:17.276 --> 11:19.382
Pretty good,
I've finished that other wall.

11:19.398 --> 11:20.471
Great.

11:20.487 --> 11:22.640
And that architrave
won't be a problem.

11:22.657 --> 11:25.102
Yeah, and the eggshell's
come out really well.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.931
Yeah, it's classy,
it's really good.

11:30.145 --> 11:31.901
Thank you for the cup of tea.

11:47.205 --> 11:49.870
'Dear Douglas, if you're reading
this it's because you've found

11:49.886 --> 11:52.081
'my father's old
service revolver.'

11:52.098 --> 11:54.542
Hell's horses.

11:54.557 --> 11:57.882
'I did plan on using this gun to take
my own life if it ever came to it,

11:57.896 --> 12:01.092
'but as you know,
in the end I jumped out of a window.

12:01.105 --> 12:04.853
'I've passed it on to you in the
hope that if things ever get too bad

12:04.867 --> 12:06.813
'you'll be able to
take the easy way out.

12:06.828 --> 12:10.311
'Hopefully it won't come to it,
but if it does you must promise me

12:10.327 --> 12:13.481
'that you'll shoot yourself
without a moment's hesitation.'

12:13.496 --> 12:16.442
I promise, Father.

12:16.456 --> 12:20.072
'Your affectionate father,
Mr Reynholm.'

12:21.746 --> 12:23.822
I wonder if it's loaded?

12:26.077 --> 12:27.621
No.

12:27.635 --> 12:30.913
Ah...here we go.

12:38.807 --> 12:40.511
You off somewhere?

12:40.525 --> 12:41.800
Er, yeah, er...

12:41.817 --> 12:45.472
So, er,
what's next on the agenda?

12:45.488 --> 12:47.802
Look Jen,
I know what's going on.

12:47.816 --> 12:49.142
You do?

12:49.155 --> 12:52.312
And it's fine,
I understand, I really do.

12:52.326 --> 12:54.483
Oh, so you understand
how I feel.

12:54.498 --> 12:58.152
Yeah, but you are barking
up the wrong tree.

12:58.167 --> 13:01.241
I mean,
I think you're a top bird and everything

13:01.255 --> 13:03.402
but you're not really my type.

13:03.417 --> 13:09.372
I mean I like tall,
beautiful girls.

13:12.795 --> 13:15.751
I don't fancy you,
you big ugly builder.

13:17.585 --> 13:22.713
I am trying to stop you having
a piddle party in my house.

13:22.725 --> 13:23.883
What?

13:23.898 --> 13:26.181
Builders From Hell.

13:26.195 --> 13:26.812
Ring any bells?

13:26.825 --> 13:28.191
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:28.238 --> 13:29.261
Oh, I think you do.

13:29.278 --> 13:30.062
Well, I don't.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.082
You haven't been on Builders From Hell,
that's what you're saying?

13:33.096 --> 13:33.740
No, I haven't.

13:33.786 --> 13:34.850
Oh, really?

13:34.868 --> 13:35.481
Yes, really.

13:35.495 --> 13:36.192
Really?

13:36.206 --> 13:37.353
Really.

13:39.238 --> 13:40.271
Well...!

13:41.366 --> 13:44.150
Let's forget about it,
shall we?

13:44.168 --> 13:48.280
Forget all about it,
this conversation's beneath us.

13:48.298 --> 13:50.783
Wow, I love what you've
done to that wall, Gary!

13:50.796 --> 13:52.040
I haven't done it yet.

13:52.055 --> 13:54.331
You haven't even done
it and I love it.

13:54.348 --> 13:57.922
Ah, this is...
You and I should stay in touch,

13:57.938 --> 14:02.962
I would like to stay in touch
with you because we've got a...

14:02.977 --> 14:05.803
A rapport, haven't we?

14:05.818 --> 14:07.472
We've clicked, we have,

14:07.487 --> 14:09.853
we've clicked haven't we?
In a way.

14:09.866 --> 14:17.100
In a...weird way that friends...
Friends usually click.

14:20.618 --> 14:24.820
A big, ugly builder.

14:24.835 --> 14:27.242
You, this is all
because of you.

14:27.255 --> 14:30.122
Jen, I didn't bring
his weight into it.

14:30.137 --> 14:33.952
You said you were 99% sure.

14:33.968 --> 14:36.463
Oh, I don't think I
ever went that high.

14:36.477 --> 14:39.252
I've always thought
it was about 60-40.

14:41.885 --> 14:43.550
Now that I think about it, Jen,

14:43.565 --> 14:46.722
I'm pretty sure that the guy
on the programme was black.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.300
Well, at least I don't
have to worry about him

14:50.315 --> 14:52.223
going on a toilet
tour of my house.

14:52.237 --> 14:55.140
Unless he's so angry that
he does it out of spite.

15:04.908 --> 15:05.983
What?

15:05.996 --> 15:08.193
Well, if someone called me a big,
ugly builder

15:08.255 --> 15:11.450
I'd be furious, and not just because
I'm actually an IT consultant.

15:13.535 --> 15:15.830
Revenge, that would be
uppermost upon my mind,

15:15.845 --> 15:17.332
I'm going to wee on everything.

15:17.347 --> 15:18.791
Oh, God.

15:18.806 --> 15:20.421
I'm going to taint her abode.

15:21.888 --> 15:25.170
I'm going to spray my personal
potatoes throughout her premises.

15:25.188 --> 15:26.422
Oh, God.

15:26.435 --> 15:28.590
Nice glasses.

15:28.608 --> 15:31.222
Not as nice as yo'
momma's glasses.

15:32.855 --> 15:35.641
It's a little bit complimentary,
but we'll work on it.

15:37.857 --> 15:41.731
I can't hang around the house,
he'll know I don't trust him.

15:41.748 --> 15:43.730
But I can't leave
him on his own.

15:43.747 --> 15:45.322
What am I going to do?

15:45.338 --> 15:47.070
What am I going to do...Roy?

15:47.085 --> 15:49.193
Jen, just relax, OK?

15:49.207 --> 15:53.283
I've often found that the best
solution is the simplest.

15:58.506 --> 16:00.660
Thanks again for
doing this, Roy.

16:00.676 --> 16:05.000
No problem, Jen. It's brilliantly
easy to spy on people these days.

16:05.015 --> 16:07.172
He won't see the cameras,
will he?

16:07.186 --> 16:10.843
Oh, no, no.
They're pretty well hidden.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.521
He's muttering a lot,
have you noticed?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.571
'Ugly builder.'

16:33.788 --> 16:36.072
Take that, lollipop man.

16:38.337 --> 16:43.502
Wow, my grandfather's
old service revolver,

16:43.516 --> 16:47.671
to think, of all the deserters
he shot in the head with this.

16:48.557 --> 16:49.590
Are you ready?

16:50.678 --> 16:51.880
Ready for what?

16:51.898 --> 16:52.881
Japan.

16:52.898 --> 16:54.640
Oh, is that meeting today?

16:54.657 --> 16:57.390
Hell's bells. You go ahead,
I'll be right there, I've just...

16:59.856 --> 17:01.480
What was that?

17:01.498 --> 17:03.352
What was what?

17:03.366 --> 17:04.311
That noise.

17:04.328 --> 17:05.851
What noise?

17:05.867 --> 17:07.363
The loud explosion.

17:07.377 --> 17:10.190
Loud explosion?
What on earth are you talking about?

17:10.207 --> 17:11.742
You didn't hear that just then?

17:11.757 --> 17:14.241
What are you talking about?

17:14.256 --> 17:16.823
You come in here
ranting about gunshots,

17:16.835 --> 17:19.332
and service revolvers.
I've had enough,

17:19.348 --> 17:23.290
get out! Go, go to the meeting,
I'll be right there.

17:26.335 --> 17:29.253
Hello, does someone have a
problem with their laptop?

17:30.888 --> 17:34.051
Now, you listen to me,
this is very important,

17:34.068 --> 17:39.431
I have a vital meeting to attend and
I've just shot myself in the leg.

17:41.818 --> 17:44.982
I want you to dial 999.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.191
No, it's a new number.

17:46.206 --> 17:48.193
01199...

17:48.208 --> 17:51.401
Whatever the new number is,

17:51.415 --> 17:54.442
get an ambulance
and ask it to wait

17:54.457 --> 17:57.700
and I'll be there in two hours,

17:57.716 --> 17:59.663
three hours tops.

18:19.226 --> 18:20.433
You ready?

18:22.356 --> 18:23.523
I was born...

18:23.535 --> 18:25.433
Ready.

18:38.707 --> 18:40.281
OK, Roy, we're on,

18:40.296 --> 18:43.082
j'accuse, gotcha.

18:43.095 --> 18:46.002
Ok, how do you record,
how do you record on this? Roy?

18:46.018 --> 18:49.923
Roy! Roy! How do you record?

19:00.848 --> 19:03.602
OK, we're on.

19:03.616 --> 19:05.521
Mr. Yamamoto, hello.

19:21.455 --> 19:22.411
He IS angry!

19:37.095 --> 19:39.591
Well, lots to
think about there.

19:39.607 --> 19:41.970
Thoughts, anyone? No.

19:41.985 --> 19:45.013
We reconvene tomorrow,
thank you, everyone.

19:45.025 --> 19:47.471
But what did it all mean?

19:51.405 --> 19:52.983
Mr Reynholm, are you all right?

19:52.996 --> 19:55.441
I'm fine, yes, yes,
I'm fine, yes.

19:55.458 --> 20:02.570
Er, I'm going to go, I may not
come back, but I want to say this,

20:02.588 --> 20:04.993
that accounts team,

20:05.005 --> 20:08.581
I had every last one of them.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.512
Just a little bit further, son.

20:24.526 --> 20:27.932
Father, is it really you?

20:27.947 --> 20:29.180
Is this really heaven?

20:29.198 --> 20:30.930
Yes, yes, hurry up, come on.

20:30.947 --> 20:33.602
I'm coming, father, I'm ready.

20:34.695 --> 20:38.692
Whoa, there, was that Hitler?

20:38.706 --> 20:39.402
Was what Hitler?

20:39.417 --> 20:41.241
That looked like Hitler.

20:41.257 --> 20:43.613
That wasn't Hitler,
that was a woman.

20:43.625 --> 20:46.582
Really? Well,
it looked exactly like Hitler.

20:46.596 --> 20:48.912
We're having a heaven party...

20:48.927 --> 20:50.910
and that's a Hitlergram.

20:50.925 --> 20:53.580
Right, well,
I don't think I'm quite ready yet.

20:53.598 --> 20:54.503
Come on.

20:54.518 --> 20:59.300
No, I'll see you later,
I've still got a lot of work to do.

20:59.315 --> 21:00.841
I'll see you later, Douglas.

21:00.857 --> 21:02.471
Not if I see you first.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.522
Must call Mark Thatcher...

21:14.527 --> 21:16.480
I'm alive,

21:16.496 --> 21:21.070
Nolan, my accounting team,

21:21.085 --> 21:24.241
and Roy, gentle Irish Roy.

21:24.258 --> 21:27.532
Thank you for being by
my side while I awake.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.331
No problem, sir.

21:29.346 --> 21:32.540
We don't want you
going anywhere.

21:35.707 --> 21:38.133
Isn't it lucky to see an
Irishman when you awake

21:38.148 --> 21:39.843
from a near death experience?

21:39.855 --> 21:43.722
I've heard that, even if it isn't,
I appreciate it, Roy,

21:43.738 --> 21:47.512
and I count myself lucky
to have you as a friend.

21:47.527 --> 21:49.103
He's exhausted, we should go.

21:49.115 --> 21:51.222
I'll stay with him.

21:51.238 --> 21:52.771
Make sure he's OK.

22:05.036 --> 22:08.990
Got you,
you crafty Irish bastard.

22:10.668 --> 22:13.000
I've got a gun!
I've got a ruddy gun!

22:13.015 --> 22:15.120
I've got a flipping gun!

22:15.137 --> 22:19.001
I've got a mother flipping gun!
