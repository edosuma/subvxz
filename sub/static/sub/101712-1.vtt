01:49.318 --> 01:51.445
Hey, boss. What are you
still doing here, man?

01:51.529 --> 01:54.323
I thought
you were taking off early.
Yeah, well, I'm trying to.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.451
Why hasn't
the concrete pour started yet?

01:57.535 --> 02:00.412
The first truck blew a hose
in the alley.
They're fixing it now.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.664
[sighs]

02:01.747 --> 02:03.374
It's always something,
huh?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.543
Why don't you just
take off, man? We got this.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.795
No, no. I know you do,
but I gotta sign the invoice.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.464
Just sign it now.
I'll hold on to it
until we're finished.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.469
All right.

02:15.553 --> 02:16.971
Thanks, Bobby.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.639
But you still call me
when it's done, okay?

02:18.722 --> 02:19.849
You got it, boss.
All right.

Sorry.

What time is it?
I thought we said 7:00.
Uh... Um...

04:36.568 --> 04:38.278
I finished work early.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.698
I can hang downstairs
if you want.
That's okay.

Five.
Five. Good.

Is the party still on
for tomorrow?

04:56.505 --> 04:57.840
Are you kidding?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.300
Nathan's invited
half the block already.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.305
How's he doing?

He's okay.

[chuckles]

05:17.985 --> 05:20.571
How long is this
gonna be awkward for?
[chuckles]

05:20.654 --> 05:23.407
I don't know, John.
It's not like I'm trying
to make it that way.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.701
'Cause if you're just
doing this for Nathan,

05:25.784 --> 05:27.661
-I'm not. I'm not.
-I-- I don't...

05:29.496 --> 05:30.664
I'm not.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.332
All right.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.877
I'm just... just checking.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.920
It's just gonna take
some time...

05:37.963 --> 05:39.965
and some effort
from the both of us.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.388
We can do this, Ali.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.643
[clears throat]

05:53.145 --> 05:55.105
All right,
I'm gonna go shower.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.483
I'll call Deb, and I'll
tell him to come home.

he washes his hands?
-Yeah.

Dad!
[laughs] Hey.

Me too.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.554
Are you still liking
this drafting table, kiddo?

06:27.638 --> 06:29.556
Yeah, I can draw
really good on it.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.226
Yeah, I see that. Wow.
[water stops]

06:32.309 --> 06:34.269

Come here.

God, you're really
a great artist, bud.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.857
Thank you.
Yeah.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.860
So, how's school?
Good.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.780
Yeah? Your teachers
talking about this thing?

06:44.863 --> 06:49.076
Yeah. Mr. Williams said
Clarke is like a big snowball,
but made of gas.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.619
Wow.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.330
Asteroids are made of farts.
Okay. I got it.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.915
[both laugh]

06:54.998 --> 06:57.584
No. Clarke
is a comet, silly,
not an asteroid.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.795
Oh, a comet. I didn't know
there was a difference.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.297
Comets move faster,
like, way, way faster.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.883
Did you know
that Clarke was from
a different solar system?

07:04.967 --> 07:06.802
Which is why they don't
know much about it.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.221
Ah. Well,
now I know two things.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.597
What?

07:10.681 --> 07:13.767
That you and comets
are made of farts.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.060
No, you are.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.480
No, you are!
Come here.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.820
How's this thing
working out?

07:24.903 --> 07:28.115
-Is it better than the shots?
-Way better.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.199
Yeah?

07:29.992 --> 07:30.993
Good.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.664
What's the matter, buddy?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.587
Is Mom gonna
make you leave again?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.674
[sighs]

07:47.843 --> 07:50.554
Your mom and I, we got
some things to work out.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.932
But no matter what...

07:54.975 --> 07:56.393
Look at me, son.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.730
I'm always gonna be
your father, all right?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.440
I'm never gonna leave you.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.984

Can you help me?

08:37.226 --> 08:39.436
All right,
what do we got?
Fractions.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.897
I thought
you were good at math.
I don't like fractions.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.399
They're hard.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.361
Well, it's okay for it to
be hard, because fractions
and math are important.

08:47.444 --> 08:51.198
You think your dad can
build skyscrapers

08:52.324 --> 08:54.493
You wanna
build skyscrapers like me?
Yeah.

Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.945
<i>Yes, but they're also saying</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:38.347
Hey. We're gonna need
some more beer and wine.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.849
Can you go to the store
for me? People are gonna
be here in an hour.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.894
Now? I'm just about
to start the grill.
Well, I need to get ready.

You need anything else while
I'm there? Just so I know.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.071
No.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.114
[John]
All right.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.784
Actually,
get some more hot-dog buns.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.787
And, um, some mustard.
We only have the spicy kind.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.580
Thanks.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.220
[rumbling]

11:18.303 --> 11:19.304
[John] All right, kiddo.

11:19.388 --> 11:20.889
Can I get a toy?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.100
If you listen and hurry.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.102
Whoa.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.650
Where are they going?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.278
I don't know.

Whoa.

Oh!

Listen, I just got one
of those Presidential Alerts.
Did you get one?

14:50.098 --> 14:52.309
No. It's probably just a test.
Can you get the stuff?

14:52.392 --> 14:55.061
No, Ali.
I don't think it's a test.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.647
They said our family's
been selected for shelter.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.192
I think something weird
is going on with this comet.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.362
But the news said
the fragment thing is falling
somewhere near Bermuda.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.865
Then why is half
of our military on the move

Can you make sure
he gets on our plane--
Meds?

31:29.471 --> 31:30.848
Yeah.
It's just his insulin.

Sergeant Ruiz?

31:32.600 --> 31:33.934
What's the problem?

31:34.018 --> 31:35.227
What's up?

31:35.311 --> 31:36.895
It's okay.
I just explained to him.

31:36.979 --> 31:39.356
It's just for his insulin pump.
It's not a big deal.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.027
You know what?
Forget it. It's fine.
We don't need it.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.987
That's not the issue,
ma'am.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.197
Don't worry about it.
We'll use the shots.
It's not a big deal.

What?

I don't remember
giving the order on that.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.657
No, tell me something,
how is there a problem
with that manifest?

32:29.740 --> 32:31.784
I signed for it myself.

32:31.867 --> 32:35.245
Then I will come down there
and check it.
I'll be down there in five.

32:37.081 --> 32:39.291
The kid's diabetic.
Don't touch him.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.669
I'm sorry.
You should've been informed.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.129
Anyone with
a chronic condition
can't be on the plane.

32:44.213 --> 32:46.006
It's just diabetes.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.425
His condition
should've been flagged
at screening.

32:48.509 --> 32:51.303
If I hadn't said anything
to the guard, he'd
have no idea he had a pump.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.222
There's nothing I can do
about that, ma'am.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.058

that you didn't see it.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.269

write the rule. Sorry.
-Then ignore it!

was your family?

ma'am.

99% of armed forces
weren't.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.453
We are all volunteers here
just doing our jobs.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.247
I'm sorry.

33:20.708 --> 33:21.709
I am.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.462
But please...

is on one of those planes
right now.

supposed to do?

Yeah, I'm looking
for a passenger.

Ma'am, what's his name?

34:11.425 --> 34:12.885
John Allan Garrity.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.094
Chalk 33?

34:16.889 --> 34:18.474
Yeah, his son was flagged.

He's age seven.
He's wearing a gray hoodie.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.261
And his mom is dark-haired.
She's about 5'7".

34:56.344 --> 34:58.639
I've seen
a lot of kids, sir.
Please keep moving.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.849
I need to know
if they made it on first.

35:00.933 --> 35:03.393
Do they have bracelets?
We all have them, yeah.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.229
Then they're on
one of these planes.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.481
Are you sure they're all
going to the same place?

35:07.564 --> 35:08.899
Yes. Now go.

There's nothing more
I can do for you.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.917
No, no, no. Come on. You can
go on one of those planes
and look for him.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.379
There are dozens of planes
with over 2,000 passengers
crammed in.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.965
I can't hold them up
for this.
Are there phones? Can I call?

35:33.048 --> 35:35.050
I don't know
if there's any phones.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.761
-Where are these planes going?
-Shelter destinations
are classified.

35:37.845 --> 35:40.681
Look, ma'am,
this is an emergency operation
with a lot of moving parts.

I am just in transport.
I wish I had
more answers for you.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.143
Please.
What am I supposed to do?

35:45.227 --> 35:47.604
I'm very sorry.
Stop, stop. No, no, no!

35:47.688 --> 35:50.816

I was selected.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.773
Yeah, I know.
With those.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.901
No, it's my son's.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.611
He's diabetic.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.197
Yeah, so is my sister's kid,
and they turned him away.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.823
They said no illnesses.

Get back in your seat.

Get back in your seat!
You gotta let me out.

37:40.342 --> 37:43.261
I've gotta get to my kid,
please. I beg you.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.555
You get off this plane,
we are leaving without you.

37:45.639 --> 37:48.350
That's okay.
Just let me off the plane!

52:51.043 --> 52:53.462
They've been tracking
the military flights
to Greenland.

52:53.546 --> 52:54.672
Greenland?

52:56.215 --> 52:57.633
You should come with us.

52:57.717 --> 52:59.218
Nah, thanks,

52:59.302 --> 53:02.346
but I gotta find my wife
and family in Kentucky.

53:02.430 --> 53:04.307
So find 'em
and meet up with us
after.

53:04.390 --> 53:06.309
We're taking off
from Osgoode.

53:06.392 --> 53:08.311
It's a small city
right across the border.

53:11.439 --> 53:13.232
How do you know
you're even gonna get in?

53:14.901 --> 53:16.611
Only one way
to find out, right?

53:59.654 --> 54:03.824
You know, it's gonna be tough
getting that far north,

54:03.908 --> 54:05.701
all the way up to Lexington.

54:08.537 --> 54:10.539
I mean,
it's crazy out here.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.502
Are you sure you don't wanna
just come with us?

54:16.128 --> 54:18.464
You know, get on a plane?

54:20.091 --> 54:24.178
I already tried that.
It didn't work, so I just need
to get to my dad's.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.846
Oh, okay.

54:28.391 --> 54:29.558
[scoffs]

54:32.478 --> 54:33.688
Ralph, what is it?

54:37.233 --> 54:39.485
I just... I can't...

54:39.568 --> 54:41.737
I can't believe
all them soldiers
at the airport,

54:41.821 --> 54:43.990
that they would
turn that boy away.

54:44.073 --> 54:45.825
I mean,
with a face like that?

54:47.868 --> 54:49.996
[woman]
She already told you
that's what happened.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.998
Yeah, well, maybe...

54:52.081 --> 54:54.625
maybe if he had
some different family
with him...

54:59.422 --> 55:02.091
-[turn signal clicking]
-What are you doing?

55:02.174 --> 55:04.010
Wait. What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?

55:04.093 --> 55:05.219
Ralph!

55:07.888 --> 55:11.892
Look, your husband,
he abandoned you.
But you don't gotta worry.

55:11.976 --> 55:13.936
I'm gonna get your son
to safety, I promise you.

55:14.020 --> 55:15.479
I'm gonna get him
on that plane.

55:15.563 --> 55:17.189
-Ralph. Wait.
-No. You don't have to--

55:17.273 --> 55:18.733
Where are you going?
Oh, my God!

55:18.816 --> 55:20.443

55:28.200 --> 55:29.952
Don't unlock the door!
God damn it, Judy!

55:30.036 --> 55:32.580
Unlock the goddamn door!

Stop!
Don't take him!

55:50.264 --> 55:51.932
Mom!
[Ralph] Stop it!

55:52.016 --> 55:54.351
-I don't wanna hurt you, okay?
-[Judy] God, I'm so sorry!

55:54.435 --> 55:56.479
-No! No! Mom!
-I don't wanna hurt you, okay?

55:56.562 --> 55:58.397
I'm gonna take care
of your son, I promise.

55:58.481 --> 56:00.191
Lock the door, Judy.
Don't take him!

56:00.274 --> 56:03.277
No, what are you doing?
Open the door!
[Nathan screams]

56:03.360 --> 56:06.822
Nathan, open the door!
Open the door!

Nope.

57:28.362 --> 57:29.613
Not what I'm asking.

57:32.700 --> 57:34.076
Where were you born?

57:36.287 --> 57:38.372
What does it matter?

57:38.455 --> 57:40.583
What matters is
you don't deserve that band.

57:45.504 --> 57:46.547
All right, listen.

57:46.630 --> 57:47.965
You're gonna give it
to me.

57:50.217 --> 57:52.219
It wouldn't do you
any good.

57:52.303 --> 57:53.804
It's got my name on it.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.473
It wouldn't work for you.

57:56.557 --> 57:58.434
You're gonna give me

Well, find something.
Find a rubber band

Don't you worry.
It's gonna be okay.

You're gonna see your mom

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:06.333
Excuse me! Coming through!
Coming through!

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.585
Excuse me! Coming through!

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:09.669
Excuse me!

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:14.466
My son-- A man and a woman,
they took him.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.093
They said something about
coming here for a flight.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.095
Ma'am, I can't hear you.

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:22.432
They took my wristband.
You probably scanned it.
Nathan Garrity.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.267
We've had hundreds of kids
through here.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.395
Look, maybe try the FEMA camp
across the street.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.068
[sirens wailing]

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:43.703

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.751
Move! Move!

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.711
You need to fill out
this consent form.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:54.339
The soldier at the checkpoint
said you might have
my son here.

01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:56.216
You need to wait in line.
Listen to me!

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.759
You need to wait in line!

01:08:57.843 --> 01:08:59.928
I need to find my son.
We're doing our best.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:02.848
He's seven years old!
He was taken from me!
Somebody just listen to me!

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.683
Ma'am. Please.
Come here. Talk to me.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.685
What's going on?
I'm trying to find my son.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.104
He's seven years old.
He's diabetic.
He was taken from me.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.106
Somebody said
he could be over here.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.524
I'll help you find your son,
but you need to calm down.
Follow me.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.823
Let's check
the pediatric tent.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:24.786
Where? Where?
Right here.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:25.871
This one?
Yes.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.625
You see him?
[Ali] Uh...

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.836
No, he's not in there.
Let's try around here.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:35.212
[baby cries]

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.761
You see him?

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:42.888
No, he's not in here.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.310
-How about here?
-No, he's not here either.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.145
It's okay. It's okay.
We'll find him.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.770
Check this one here.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.000
[gasps] Nathan! Nathan.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.003
Mom!
Oh, honey!
Oh, my God. [sobs]

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:16.087
Look at me.

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:17.923
Oh, baby.

01:10:18.924 --> 01:10:21.635
[sobbing] I'm so sorry!

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.554
Oh, my God!

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.559
I'm so sorry.

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:34.439
I'll never
let that happen again.
I'm so sorry.

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.610
I'm fine, Mom.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.487
He's a remarkable young man.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:43.949
You're Allison.
Yeah.

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:47.202
He's type one diabetic.
I've gotta check his levels.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.620
He told us.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.497
We checked his levels twice.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.540
Gave him some insulin,
new pump.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.542
If I can get you
to sign this release form,

01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:56.878
I can move you guys
into a family tent.

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:58.421
[Nathan sobs]

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.801
No, um... we're going
to my father's.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:06.638
I lost my...
I lost my husband.
We're gonna find him.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.264
I'm so sorry.

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:09.724
Where does your father live?

01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:13.520
In Lexington.
Near Lexington.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:17.857
Okay. Maybe I can get you
on a military bus
heading in that direction.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.694
And I also put together
a week's supply
of glucose tabs,

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.279
and insulin,
and test strips, so...

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:26.825
I wish
I could give you more,
but it's all we have.

01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:30.620
[sobs] Thank you.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.044

You're alone.
Where's Allison?

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.438
Where is she?
I was hoping she'd be here.

01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:09.816
Why are my friends stuck here
babysitting me

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.902
while my daughter and grandson
are out there alone,

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:15.154
and I'm here
with no way to find them?

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.408
We lost each other at
the airfield, and she left me
a note to meet her here.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.451
[sighs] Fuck.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.456
[man 3]
Maybe we should go.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.167
She told me you were
moving back in.

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.795
Let me guess,
you had another fight?

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:34.257
We both want the same thing,
okay, for them
to get here safely.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.801
So why don't we try
to work together?

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:40.555
Okay.
Did you try the landline?

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:44.100
Go ahead. I tried
about an hour ago again.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.935
Keeps going
straight to voice mail.

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.438
Or you get that
stupid government message.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.651
[grunts] God, you would
think technology would
work in emergencies.

01:16:58.573 --> 01:16:59.574
Hey.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:02.952
What happened to you?

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.829
Nothing.
Come on.

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.795
Just want 'em back.
I just--

01:17:59.759 --> 01:18:02.428
[Ali] Okay,
there's a pay phone there.
Let's try that.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.561
Yes.

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.773

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.529
Hello? Where? Stay there.
Stay right there.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.031
Where are they?
Down the road. Let's go.

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:39.674

01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:41.676

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.729
I'm sorry, honey.
I tried. I tried.

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:56.524
I know. It's okay.

01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:58.526
Kiddo.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.236
How you doing?
Good.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.071
Yeah? Here.

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:05.366
Come here.
How you doing? Okay?

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.493
Thanks for looking after
your mom, bud.

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.458

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.917

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:17.003
Hey, sunflower.
[Ali cries]

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:25.887
[breathes deeply] Oh.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.977
Come on, honey.
Let's get you guys home.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.021
Okay.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.192
Come on.

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.195
[crying continues]

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.698
All right, welcome.
You hungry?
What do you wanna eat?

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.825
Pancakes.
Pancakes. Syrup?

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:48.993
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:50.745
No.
No.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.538
No. I forgot.
We don't have enough insulin
as it is.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.915
Aw!

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:56.250
I have his medication here.
You do?

01:19:56.334 --> 01:19:59.670
Yeah. It was out of
the fridge for a long time,
but it should still be good.

01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:00.755
Thank you.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.593
[Ali's dad]
You remember where this goes?

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:08.387
What do you want?
Some water?
Some water, yeah.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.806
Way to go. All right!

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.059
This good?
Yep! Perfect.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.229
"Perfectomundo."
We should check the news.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.439
What do you think?

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:22.068

A lot of good

The footage is older than me.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.196
Who knows
what shape it's in?

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.781
At least here
we'll be together.

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.325
What are you doing, John?

01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:14.287
There's another way
for us to get there.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.706
Where?
To Greenland.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.916
There are pilots going
from up in Canada.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.751
They're taking people.
They're not military.

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:23.504
Look, it's just over
12 hours to Osgoode.

01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:25.339
But we can do it in nine.

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.717
And then
it's another six to eight
hours for the flight.

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.553
We can make this.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.638
My bracelet. What if
they don't let us in? They've
already flagged Nathan.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:34.473
Honey, it's our only chance.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:37.351
Now listen. We can either stay
here or we can give it a shot.

01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:40.771
But if we give it a shot,
I swear I will get us
into those bunkers.

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:44.025
But if we're gonna go,

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.651
we gotta go now.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.988
Okay.
Okay.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.948
Okay. Let's do it.
All right.

There'll be more planes

my wife and son.

Then we're not moving,
all right?

01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:54.929
We're staying there,
and you're not going
anywhere!

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:02.145
Okay, I can take the kid,
maybe your wife.

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:05.273
