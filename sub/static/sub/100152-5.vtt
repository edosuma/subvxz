00:29.446 --> 00:32.031
Warren, I've got the printout
of all the coordinates.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.034
Thanks.

00:38.956 --> 00:43.001
Okay, <i>Endeavour</i>, got you.
Molly, you are live on all networks.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.713
<i>I'm on TV? Really?</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:50.509
<i>Oh, I wish you'd told me.
I'd have done something with my hair.</i>

00:50.592 --> 00:55.973
I like this look. You look gorgeous, babe.
Oh, my God. There's my girl.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.518
How come everything's about her?

01:01.311 --> 01:05.315
'Cause... she's a novelty, you know?
First woman astronaut.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.150
Yeah, but Dad's her boss.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.944
Okay... Just eat your cereal.

01:09.319 --> 01:13.448
<i>Molly, millions of people around the world
are eager to hear your thoughts</i>

01:13.532 --> 01:15.534
<i>now that you're in orbit around the moon.</i>

01:16.869 --> 01:18.704
It's pretty humbling.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.332
You can see the entire world
from this window here.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.460
Hard to believe
that anyone I've ever known,

01:25.544 --> 01:29.256
every country, every civilization,

01:29.339 --> 01:32.634
is contained
in that tiny blue-and-white ball.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.475
Molly, we've got thousands of letters
from women you've inspired.

01:40.559 --> 01:44.646
I have one here from eight-year-old
Abigail Crouse in Solvang, California.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.023
I'd like to read it to you.

01:46.106 --> 01:51.236
"Dear Molly. I have loved space
for as long as I can remember.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.324
My brother has models
of all the Apollo ships,

01:55.407 --> 01:58.410
and I used to get in trouble
for playing with them.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.496
<i>But after you got picked
to be on Apollo 15,</i>

02:01.580 --> 02:04.291
<i>my dad bought me a model of my own.</i>

02:05.000 --> 02:07.920
<i>I named the command module </i>Cobb

02:08.503 --> 02:11.840
<i>and the LEM </i>Molly<i> after you.</i>

02:12.758 --> 02:16.428
<i>Some kids at school
say there's no water on the moon</i>

02:16.512 --> 02:18.555
<i>and your mission is a joke.</i>

02:18.639 --> 02:23.060
<i>But I believe in you,
and I know you will find it.</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:25.145
<i>Your friend, Abigail."</i>

02:25.938 --> 02:29.858
<i>Anything you wanna say to Abby?
I'm sure she's watching.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.155
Abigail, I will try not to let you down.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.868
<i>And that is a cut.
We're off the air. Good job.</i>

02:40.786 --> 02:41.954
A star is born.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.790
Don't forget the little people
who helped you along the way.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.416
Just as fast as I can.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.044
Endeavour<i>. Before Molly starts
shopping for an agent,</i>

02:49.419 --> 02:50.796
<i>we got some good news for you.</i>

02:51.129 --> 02:52.297
Rocky Ray and the geo boys

02:52.381 --> 02:54.967
have been going over the spectroscopy
from your recon orbits,

02:55.050 --> 02:57.261
and they think that they have found ice.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.304
Tons of it. Literally, tons.

02:59.388 --> 03:02.099
Well, tell us where it is,
and we'll bring you back a snow cone.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.184
<i>Negative, </i>Endeavour<i>.</i>

03:04.268 --> 03:08.063
<i>The geo team will use that data
to pick spots for later missions,</i>

03:08.146 --> 03:11.984
<i>'cause the ice is nowhere near
your landing site at Mare Frigoris.</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:14.111
Where is it?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.405
<i>It's at the south pole. Shackleton Crater.</i>

03:20.242 --> 03:23.829
Let's go. Change the plan.
Land us at Shackleton.

03:24.580 --> 03:25.873
That's quite a big change, Ed.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.208
No shit. 4,000 kilometers worth.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.712
No.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.589
Flight's giving that a big thumbs down.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.050
It's too big a risk, and you don't have
the gear for that kind of exploration.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.678
You'll land at Frigoris, as planned.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.472
<i>We'll re-task Apollo 16 for Shackleton.</i>

03:42.556 --> 03:45.851
Before we left, lab coats told us
the ice concentration at Frigoris

03:45.934 --> 03:48.395
was around 250 parts per million.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.772
So what's the read on Shackleton?

03:51.106 --> 03:54.484
<i>After your survey,
it could be 500 times better.</i>

03:55.319 --> 03:58.071
Well, then I strongly suggest
you folks rethink this.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.491
We didn't come all this way
just to dig a bunch of dry holes.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.460
Houston, going off VOX for a few.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.212
<i>Roger that, </i>Endeavour<i>.</i>

04:14.296 --> 04:15.422
Let's have it, Mol.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.926
What happened to "stick with
the mission plan, no matter what"?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.261
The mission's to find ice.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.639
We flew over Shackleton in the first place

04:23.722 --> 04:25.724
just to get the data
they're all crowing about.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.644
-You on board with this?
-Changing a landing site mid-flight?

04:29.353 --> 04:32.856
It's dangerous and stupid. I love it.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.443
Of course you do.
You're not the one going down there.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.529
-Hey, you wanna swap jobs?
-Hey.

04:48.747 --> 04:53.043
The CIA is worried that the Soviets
will place military assets on the moon.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.295
Why would anyone put missiles on the moon?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.298
All I know is
the president wants that base.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.425
We need a beachhead against the Soviets.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.094
Shackleton looks like the place for it,

05:02.177 --> 05:05.055
so if we can get Apollo 15 there first,
we should do it.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.686
My crew gets the final say.

05:14.898 --> 05:15.899
Talk to them.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.446
<i>We practiced for Frigoris.</i>

05:21.530 --> 05:23.657
Nobody knows what's on the ground
at Shackleton.

05:23.991 --> 05:28.370
We get no points if we crash and burn
in some half-baked, last-minute approach.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.080
That's funny,
'cause "half-baked, last-minute"

05:30.163 --> 05:31.874
was your entire approach to training.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.793
Well, that was then.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.172
Look,
sometimes you gotta roll the hard six.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.798
What's that supposed to mean?

05:39.882 --> 05:43.886
It means no risk, no water from the moon.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.182
Look, if it were just me, gimme the dice.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.768
But if we auger in, it won't be,
"Baldwin screwed the pooch."

05:51.852 --> 05:54.229
It'll be, "Women can't hack it in space."

05:54.313 --> 05:56.565
And what do you think they'll say
if we come home empty-handed?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.108
What the press has being saying all along:

05:58.192 --> 06:00.235
That this mission is
just a publicity stunt.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.320
Exactly.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.198
Endeavour<i>, Houston.</i>

06:04.281 --> 06:06.283
<i>We've reconsidered a Shackleton landing.</i>

06:06.366 --> 06:08.535
<i>Flight dynamics has
a DOI burn that will take you down there,</i>

06:08.619 --> 06:11.705
<i>but we do not know
what kind of landing site you will find.</i>

06:11.788 --> 06:15.042
It's high risk, so it's... it's your call.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.294
You still up for it?

06:20.756 --> 06:24.259
It's up to you, Cobb.
Can't do this unless you're on board.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.146
Fuck yeah. Let's do it.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.565
That's what I'm talking about. Attagirl.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.486
Houston, this is <i>Endeavour</i>.
We are go for Shackleton.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.739
You remember what you told me
just before launch?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.866
Yeah, well, now you're really
gonna do something.

08:06.862 --> 08:12.284
<i>The lunar module </i>Seahawk<i> has
left orbit on the far side of the moon,</i>

08:12.367 --> 08:16.330
<i>and they are preparing to initiate
their descent to Shackleton Crater.</i>

08:16.413 --> 08:19.499
<i>That's one step closer for Astronaut Cobb</i>

08:19.583 --> 08:21.668
<i>on her way to becoming
the first American woman on the moon.</i>

08:21.752 --> 08:22.920
Excuse me, ladies.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.964
<i>The historic mission also hopes
to answer the question</i>

08:26.048 --> 08:29.259
<i>of whether there is ice
on the surface of the moon.</i>

08:29.343 --> 08:34.181
<i>Scientists say that the most likely area
would be deep within craters</i>

08:34.264 --> 08:37.392
<i>that are rarely touched
by the rays of the sun.</i>

08:37.934 --> 08:43.357
<i>The discovery of ice, and therefore water,
would allow a permanent US lunar base...</i>

08:43.440 --> 08:45.067
Karen, hi. Sorry I'm late...

08:45.692 --> 08:47.444
No, you made it before they landed.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.571
Yeah. Listen,

08:49.655 --> 08:53.575
I know you folks like to drink,
so I hope you like mezcal.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.994
I've never had it.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.538
You're in for a treat.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.540
This was distilled in Oaxaca.

08:59.957 --> 09:03.085
It's the kind the consul drinks
in <i>Under the Volcano</i>.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.546
Is that a movie?

09:05.629 --> 09:08.465
No, no.
It's a brilliant novel about an alcoholic.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.553
But, I mean, he has many
redeeming qualities as well.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.514
He's kind of a tragic hero
in his own warped way, so...

09:16.098 --> 09:17.516
-you should check it out...
-Okay. Yeah.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.269
Why don't you come on in?
'Cause they're getting ready to land.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.363
Seahawk, <i>five seconds to powered descent.</i>

09:31.446 --> 09:36.285
Roger that. Ninety-nine. Proceed.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.121
Let's try not to screw this up, Cobb.
Okay?

09:39.413 --> 09:41.748
<i>The stakes have never been higher.</i>

09:42.124 --> 09:45.294
Seahawk<i> is now eight minutes away</i>

09:45.377 --> 09:49.339
<i>from a dangerous landing
in uncharted terrain.</i>

09:50.215 --> 09:53.677
<i>Critics are calling NASA's last-minute
change of plan</i>

09:54.386 --> 09:57.931
<i>"the most foolhardy thing
that the agency has ever attempted...</i>

09:58.015 --> 09:59.099
Come here, buddy.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.643
<i>...and an unjustified risk to the life</i>

10:01.727 --> 10:04.980
<i>of the first American woman
to journey to the moon."</i>

10:05.647 --> 10:07.441
<i>Let's hope they're wrong.</i>

10:08.650 --> 10:10.277
<i>Throttle down.</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:11.987
<i>No flags. Looks good.</i>

10:12.946 --> 10:15.324
High gate. Braking phase complete.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.118
Forward speed's good, descent nominal.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.705
<i>Oxidizers running about one percent low.</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:22.956
<i>Okay.</i>

10:23.040 --> 10:26.335
<i>Houston</i>, Seahawk.
<i>We're gonna level her out for a bit.</i>

10:26.418 --> 10:27.544
Roger,<i> Seahawk.</i>

10:34.551 --> 10:35.844
PNGCS and AGS agree.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.394
This is close as I got on Apollo 10.

10:53.946 --> 10:57.366
Stick with me, kid.
I'll take you all the way this time.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.370
That's the Cobb I was looking for.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.004
RCS is good. No flags.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.425
Position checks downrange.
Short by 15 nautical miles.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.470
DPS pressure is still good.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.309
Coming over Shackleton.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.773
Sure is dark down there.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.572
Still over the crater,
about four nautical miles from the rim,

11:36.655 --> 11:38.282
so altitude readings are high.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.076
<i>Seventeen percent fuel.</i>

11:41.785 --> 11:43.662
That could become an issue, Flight.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.122
Come on, Ed.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.505
PNGCS and AGS compare.

11:54.548 --> 11:58.010
Fuel and oxidizer within one percent.
Looking good.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.513
Okay, boss. Time to find us a campsite.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.731
Okay. Houston,
I have designated a nice, flat patch,

12:10.814 --> 12:14.151
about a quarter mile from Shackleton,
as our landing site.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.528
That's gonna be a tight needle to thread.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.406
Well, that's what they pay me for.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.492
Two thousand feet, 42.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.411
Okay.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.289
This is a good spot.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.251
800 feet. Forty-four. Forty-five.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.921
Seahawk<i>, Houston. Go for landing.</i>

12:34.796 --> 12:37.174
Okay. Here we go.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.304
Forty-four, 400 feet.
Twenty feet per second.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.765
Okay. I'm in P66.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.018
Fifty feet at minus three.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.647
<i>Cross-pointer's looking good.
Seven percent fuel.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:54.024
<i>Okay, picking up a lot of dust.</i>

12:55.400 --> 12:59.613
Fifteen at one. Minus one.
Six percent fuel.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.116
Eight feet. Minus one.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.662
-Contact.
-Shutdown.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.847
Houston, Shackleton Base.
<i>Seahawk </i>has landed.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.474
Wow.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.730
We're really here.

13:33.814 --> 13:38.277
I have never wanted a cigarette
more in my entire life.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.904
You've come a long way, baby.

13:50.622 --> 13:54.168
Okay, let's go around the horn.
Stay or no stay for T-1.

13:55.586 --> 13:56.670
What do you think of your dad?

13:56.753 --> 13:59.298
-He's the best.
-He is, right?

14:22.696 --> 14:23.947
Hey. Baby!

14:27.910 --> 14:32.831
Oh, you are a sight.
A beautiful, beautiful sight.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.585
-You too.
-Oh, yeah.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.841
Tell me what you're doing at NASA.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.053
Not much.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.765
I'm going to PR events
as the token black girl.

14:51.767 --> 14:52.809
And that's it?

14:54.436 --> 14:57.648
After everything you did to earn that pin,
and that's all they give you?

14:57.731 --> 14:58.732
Yeah.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.236
Well, there is one other thing
they want me to do.

15:02.611 --> 15:03.612
What?

15:04.821 --> 15:05.906
Fly to the moon.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.368
Wait. Are you saying that...

15:09.451 --> 15:13.163
Yes! I have been assigned to Apollo 18!

15:13.247 --> 15:14.873
You are shitting me!

15:15.749 --> 15:18.335
No, Clay! I'm going! I'm going!

15:18.961 --> 15:21.880
I told you! I told you!
They can't hold you back.

15:40.774 --> 15:45.070
<i>There has never been a more modern, more
complete family-friendly vehicle than...</i>

15:45.153 --> 15:47.155
All right, I've got fresh corn here.

15:47.239 --> 15:50.701
Mom, can we watch <i>Laugh-In</i>
until Dad comes on again?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.452
Sure. Just keep it on low.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.623
Let me help you clear the table.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.293
Thanks, Trace.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.254
I was gonna make my fried chicken,
but I ran out of time,

16:02.337 --> 16:04.756
so I had Sheila roast some.
It's in the kitchen. I'll go get it.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.093
Oh, no, that's okay.
It's pretty full here right now.

16:08.177 --> 16:10.762
Let's leave it in the kitchen
and we can always bring it out later.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.640
-All right.
-<i>No.</i>

16:13.724 --> 16:17.144
<i>I don't think we could get Mr. Nixon
to stand still for a "sock it to me."</i>

16:19.146 --> 16:20.772
<i>Sock it to me?</i>

16:23.942 --> 16:25.986
Well, I guess
congratulations are in order.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.364
I hear that you've been assigned
to crew of Apollo 25.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.326
Yeah. Word travels fast.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.537
-Are you excited?
-Oh, I'm out of my mind.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.915
You know, if someone
had told me two years ago

16:37.998 --> 16:40.250
I'd be orbiting Earth,
repairing a satellite,

16:40.334 --> 16:42.377
I'd have thought they were insane.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.129
Me too.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.931
So, when are you and Larry
getting married?

16:56.558 --> 16:57.684
I don't know.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.230
We've only been seeing each other
for a couple of months, so...

17:01.313 --> 17:05.192
So? My Frank knew the moment
he laid eyes on me that I was the one.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.945
It's obvious you two are crazy about
each other. What are you waiting for?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.114
I don't think Larry is ready to...

17:11.198 --> 17:14.034
Nonsense. Men don't know what they want.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.871
I actually had to drag Frank
down the aisle.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.415
But I knew he was secretly glad I did.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.088
It's nice to see you, Gloria.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.854
Hi. You care for some corn?

17:42.437 --> 17:43.564
Thanks.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.315
Sure.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.821
You must feel relieved to know
that Molly's landed safely.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.949
You don't know the half of it.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.995
I haven't been able to sleep much
these last few nights, you know?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.454
I just kinda...

18:02.416 --> 18:03.750
You...

18:05.294 --> 18:08.964
You ever dream about Ed augering in?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.884
That's what they call it, isn't it?
When the plane...

18:11.967 --> 18:16.680
Yeah. That is what they call it,
but the answer's no. Never.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.808
-Really?
-Yeah. I don't dream.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.688
You've never had one dream
in your entire life?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.942
Maybe when I was a kid, but...

18:31.904 --> 18:33.322
I must've outgrown them.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.617
You're a very fortunate individual, Karen.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.745
This dream last night, it kicked my ass.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.790
Try not to think about it.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.584
I wish I could do that.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.419
It was just so weird.

18:48.086 --> 18:52.174
I was walking across
the surface of the moon, stark naked.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.510
No space suit or anything.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.136
That's absurd.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.514
Yeah, but in the dream,
it seemed totally natural.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.267
I could even feel the grains of sand
sifting through my toes.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.604
And then I came upon this huge crater,

19:05.687 --> 19:08.815
and I see all this smoke billowing
out of it and then...

19:08.899 --> 19:10.275
You know, Wayne,

19:10.359 --> 19:13.028
I think that maybe talking about it
doesn't help.

19:13.612 --> 19:16.156
You just have to put it out of your mind
for now. Okay?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.283
Wait, wait, wait.
Please just listen, listen.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.202
I need to tell someone who'll understand.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.872
I climb to the top of the crater
and I'm looking down,

19:23.956 --> 19:26.625
and at the bottom is
Molly's ship in flames.

19:28.001 --> 19:31.171
And then suddenly I'm running down
into the crater and stumbling

19:31.255 --> 19:34.299
and there's sand getting in my eyes
and my mouth.

19:34.842 --> 19:38.470
And I call out for her. And I get nothing.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.180
I can't find her anywhere.

19:41.557 --> 19:44.268
So I run around the ship,
and then that's when I see...

19:46.436 --> 19:47.563
See what?

19:49.690 --> 19:50.899
Her head.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.027
It's Molly's decapitated head and her...

19:54.111 --> 19:56.363
'Cause her helmet's cracked wide open,

19:56.446 --> 19:58.782
and her face is blistered and burned,
and there's black...

19:58.866 --> 20:00.242
Wayne, enough.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.203
That's enough.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.957
We don't talk about these things. Ever.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.092
Take a step to your right.
Let me get that rise behind you.

20:17.801 --> 20:19.636
How many more of these are we gonna take?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.638
I'm not Raquel Welch, for Chrissake.

20:22.097 --> 20:25.309
It's part of the mission.
So we do it. Visor up.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.446
Okay.

20:37.529 --> 20:41.533
Houston, I suggest we wrap this up.
Hope we got one Shorty likes.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.285
<i>I'm sure he'll be ecstatic, Ed.</i>

20:43.368 --> 20:46.496
If you could both turn to face
the TV camera,

20:46.580 --> 20:49.666
the president of the United States
would like to speak with Molly.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.544
Holy shit. Are you kidding?

20:54.838 --> 20:57.925
No, I'm not. And I'd like to remind you
that we're on network TV.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.220
<i>Sorry. Hope you can bleep that out.</i>

21:05.390 --> 21:07.768
<i>Hello, Mr. President.</i>

21:08.268 --> 21:09.686
<i>Hello, Molly</i>.

21:09.770 --> 21:13.607
<i>I'm talking to you by telephone
from the Oval Room at the White House.</i>

21:14.024 --> 21:16.693
<i>I just can't tell you how proud we all are</i>

21:16.777 --> 21:20.614
<i>of what you have done for your country
and for women everywhere.</i>

21:21.323 --> 21:23.325
<i>Well, it's an honor, Mr. President.</i>

21:23.742 --> 21:26.578
<i>I hope I can bring you back enough ice
for a highball.</i>

21:26.995 --> 21:28.997
<i>I know how much you enjoy a stiff drink.</i>

21:30.958 --> 21:33.794
<i>Bring back enough for two,
and I'll have that drink with you</i>.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.088
<i>I look forward to it, Mr. President.</i>

21:36.505 --> 21:39.925
<i>I pray that you and your crewmates
have a safe voyage home.</i>

21:40.008 --> 21:41.093
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

21:44.680 --> 21:46.682
<i>Broadcast live from the moon.</i>

21:46.765 --> 21:48.767
I never really believed I'd see this.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.895
I guess the times really are a-changin'.

21:51.979 --> 21:55.023
-To Molly.
-To Molly.

21:55.107 --> 21:59.778
<i>It sounds like Astronaut Cobb expects
their search for ice to be successful.</i>

21:59.862 --> 22:01.446
<i>Over the next three days,</i>

22:01.530 --> 22:04.950
<i>Cobb and Baldwin
will be using their lunar rover.</i>

22:05.033 --> 22:08.620
Well, I hate to give you all
the bum's rush, but I gotta to get to bed.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.831
This early? It's only 6:00.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.792
Yeah. They completed their EVA,
and Ed'll be bedding down soon

22:13.876 --> 22:17.546
and you know, when he goes to sleep
on the moon, I go to sleep down here.

22:17.629 --> 22:18.964
And when he gets up, I get up.

22:21.884 --> 22:23.260
Thanks.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.601
Let's go. Come on.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.939
Thank you for everything.
I appreciate your help today.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.691
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.860
-Thank you, Karen.
-Bye.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.948
-Karen, I'm sorry if I...
-Thank you for coming.

22:48.577 --> 22:51.538
-Okay. See ya.
-Bye.

22:52.331 --> 22:53.332
Bye, Wayne.

22:55.959 --> 23:00.172
That guy is so freaking weird.
And he smells funny.

23:01.507 --> 23:03.300
Oh, that's 'cause he's been smoking weed.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.722
-What? You mean like...
-Marijuana.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.350
Jesus, Trace. In my house?

23:11.725 --> 23:14.353
No, no. I think he did it
before he came over.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.314
Anyway, thanks for having us, Karen.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.607
Yeah, okay.

23:40.379 --> 23:41.505
-Hey, Margo.
-Hi.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.802
Morning, Shackleton Base.
White Team's back with you.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.804
<i>Glad to hear it, Fred.</i>

23:48.887 --> 23:51.181
Red Team mentioned
we're seeing data but no picture.

23:51.807 --> 23:53.725
<i>Still mounting the big eye on the rover.</i>

23:54.601 --> 23:57.271
And is Molly's drink bag
still squirting in her face?

23:57.354 --> 24:00.774
<i>Negative. I bent the mic away
from the mouthpiece,</i>

24:01.149 --> 24:04.027
<i>which is great for scratching your nose,
by the way.</i>

24:04.111 --> 24:06.488
I'll note that for the folks going on 16.

24:06.572 --> 24:08.615
<i>Cycling the TV power switch now.</i>

24:10.701 --> 24:12.369
You're in living color.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.788
The big eye's operational.

24:14.872 --> 24:18.166
All right. Let's go find ourselves
a big bucket of ice.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.334
<i>Roger that.</i>

24:40.564 --> 24:42.941
Do mission commanders
normally hold meetings here?

24:43.859 --> 24:45.777
-This one does.
-Okay.

24:53.994 --> 24:57.497
Danielle.
Welcome to the crew of Apollo 18.

24:57.873 --> 24:58.874
Thank you, sir.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.210
-It's Clayton, right?
-Yeah, that's right.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.753
Let me grab another glass.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.261
I am really gonna work your ass off.

25:12.513 --> 25:14.181
I wouldn't have it any other way.

25:14.264 --> 25:16.308
We're gonna get together next week,

25:16.391 --> 25:19.186
sit down with Deke and go over
the mission plan. Cheers.

25:19.269 --> 25:20.479
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

25:23.524 --> 25:26.235
I gotta say, I am surprised
I got assigned so quickly.

25:27.069 --> 25:30.280
I'm not.
Your friend Molly's kicking ass up there.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.492
Really put to bed
any notion that women can't cut it.

25:34.493 --> 25:36.662
'Course, I never had any doubts.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.996
Neither did I.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.834
Clayton, you just get back from Nam?

25:42.668 --> 25:44.044
That I did.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.589
Someone take your ribbons?

25:48.507 --> 25:53.053
No. I threw them in the sentry's face
on my way out the door.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.516
Lot of that going on these days.

25:57.933 --> 25:59.726
Might have to dig out
a few of my old medals.

25:59.810 --> 26:02.312
There's a few faces
I'd like to throw 'em in too.

26:12.906 --> 26:15.033
You a Louis Armstrong fan, Danielle?

26:17.953 --> 26:19.872
Yes, very much so.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.709
You could say his Hot Five
and Hot Seven records

26:23.792 --> 26:25.919
changed the DNA of American music.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.338
Don't know those.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.757
But I love his version of "Hello, Dolly!"

26:32.509 --> 26:33.719
Oh, yeah.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.390
"Hello, Dolly!" That's a good one.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.474
Hello.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.953
Karen. What are you doing here?

27:01.038 --> 27:02.539
I wanna talk to you.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.917
Sure. Come in.

27:07.586 --> 27:09.379
Can I get you some tea?

27:11.423 --> 27:12.424
I'm fine.

27:13.926 --> 27:15.093
Mind if I get some?

27:16.053 --> 27:17.054
No.

27:44.331 --> 27:47.876
That's for Santana. They're a band.

27:48.794 --> 27:50.587
Playing in Houston next month.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.589
Nice.

27:53.966 --> 27:54.967
Yeah.

28:25.789 --> 28:26.874
Oh, my...

28:28.292 --> 28:29.293
It's my dream.

28:30.961 --> 28:32.462
You're painting it?

28:33.630 --> 28:35.174
Yeah. Get it out of my head.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.718
Is that what that is for too?

28:39.052 --> 28:40.053
It's a doobie.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.139
No, it's marijuana.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.100
Molly's career would be
over in a heartbeat

28:45.184 --> 28:47.394
if someone found out
you were using drugs, Wayne.

28:47.477 --> 28:49.479
Marijuana isn't a drug.
It's a natural herb.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.690
Oh, then why is having it a felony?

28:51.773 --> 28:54.234
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the liquor lobby?

28:54.985 --> 28:57.738
I see. You think that this is all a joke.

28:58.322 --> 29:00.240
That you can just do
whatever the hell you wanna do.

29:00.324 --> 29:03.660
That you can get high and then,
what, screw with the straight lady?

29:03.744 --> 29:06.705
Wow. You are really something.

29:08.457 --> 29:11.919
I thought you were the one person in
this whole program who might understand.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.047
-Understand what?
-That my wife could die up there!

29:16.173 --> 29:20.177
Maybe you can pretend that
everything is fine. But I can't do that.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.304
-Just settle down, Wayne, okay?
-Settle down? What? Settle...

29:22.387 --> 29:24.097
How do you settle down, Karen?

29:24.640 --> 29:26.808
I feel like my cerebral cortex is
gonna explode.

29:26.892 --> 29:31.021
So, if I need to paint my nightmares
to get them out of my fucking head

29:31.104 --> 29:33.857
or smoke a joint
to keep from going stark raving mad,

29:33.941 --> 29:35.734
that's what I'm going to do!

29:36.735 --> 29:38.070
And I'll tell you what doesn't help.

29:38.153 --> 29:41.865
You coming over here and passing
judgment on me. That doesn't help.

29:41.949 --> 29:44.618
-Okay, I didn't...
-Because if I lose Molly...

29:44.701 --> 29:45.911
If she doesn't...

29:52.417 --> 29:55.504
Wayne, you're not gonna lose Molly, okay?

29:55.587 --> 29:57.881
Ed won't let anything happen to her,
I promise.

29:57.965 --> 30:00.717
You can't control things
with positive thought.

30:00.801 --> 30:04.346
Don't you guys get that here?
We have no control.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.395
Going through the sample cases
pretty quick, Mol.

30:11.478 --> 30:14.439
I wish we were filling them
with ice and not just rocks.

30:14.523 --> 30:17.359
If we don't score today,
we'll find it tomorrow.

30:17.943 --> 30:19.820
I'll believe it if you will.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.657
There may be downsides
to being an astronaut,

30:23.740 --> 30:26.451
but it sure beats digging ditches.

30:32.457 --> 30:33.709
What you got for me?

30:33.792 --> 30:35.252
Just more rocks.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.339
Houston, this is another dead end.

30:39.423 --> 30:43.135
<i>If there is ice here, it is down deep,
or it's in that crater.</i>

30:43.218 --> 30:46.138
Roger, Shackleton. Word is
to wrap it up and head for the barn.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.222
<i>Sounds good.</i>

30:48.891 --> 30:51.351
Have another face tightener.
Good for the soul.

30:51.894 --> 30:53.687
"Good for the soul." I like that.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.820
So, where were you posted?

31:02.905 --> 31:04.781
Twenty-first Infantry, Da Nang.

31:06.950 --> 31:11.163
I knew some chopper pilots there.
It's heavy shit.

31:11.663 --> 31:14.875
To say the least. You serve in Korea?

31:17.544 --> 31:18.795
I was too young.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.550
Space kept me outta Vietnam.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.094
Of course it did.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.223
Well played.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.982
My dad was a Marine in the South Pacific.

31:40.651 --> 31:45.030
He never talked about it,
but I read a few accounts.

31:46.365 --> 31:47.366
Horrendous.

31:49.660 --> 31:52.663
I guess I always wondered
how I'd hold up under fire.

31:55.082 --> 31:56.166
But not too curious

31:56.250 --> 31:59.211
that you'd give up that astronaut pin
and get in the shit yourself, right?

32:02.798 --> 32:05.175
What do you mean by that?
What are you trying to say?

32:05.259 --> 32:07.010
Easy, tiger. Come on.

32:08.011 --> 32:10.472
I'm just saying you're better off
not knowing. That's all.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.724
Right.

32:16.144 --> 32:17.479
So, what's it's like?

32:18.355 --> 32:19.356
Combat?

32:28.907 --> 32:31.118
At first you're terrified.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.288
Miserable.

32:35.330 --> 32:39.710
But then the fighting starts
and suddenly everything is at stake.

32:40.127 --> 32:44.047
Your life. Your friends' lives.
It's transcendent.

32:44.756 --> 32:46.550
You know,
'cause you're no longer a person.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.052
You're the platoon now, right?

32:49.136 --> 32:51.263
And the platoon can't be beat.

32:52.222 --> 32:56.852
You experience this savage joy
in overcoming the enemy.

33:01.857 --> 33:03.692
Is that what happened at My Lai?

33:06.862 --> 33:09.698
That savage joy?

33:12.201 --> 33:13.202
I wasn't in My Lai.

33:13.952 --> 33:17.623
I know. I was just asking you
what you think happened there.

33:18.207 --> 33:19.833
Since you seem to be such an expert.

33:20.209 --> 33:21.335
All right. That's enough.

33:21.418 --> 33:25.339
No. You wanted to know
what combat was like.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.716
Not what it was like to commit murder.

33:28.383 --> 33:31.220
But I can understand your confusion,
since you weren't in it.

33:32.346 --> 33:36.016
Instead, you let your buddies
napalm villages and bomb schools.

33:36.099 --> 33:38.101
Yeah. You're probably right.

33:39.728 --> 33:42.773
I guess you only get to feel
that savage joy

33:42.856 --> 33:44.900
if you're close enough
to see the bullet hits.

33:46.276 --> 33:48.028
That's a fascinating insight.

33:49.530 --> 33:50.697
You make another one like that,

33:50.781 --> 33:52.533
and I'll kick your teeth
down the back of your throat.

33:52.616 --> 33:53.825
I'm right here.

33:53.909 --> 33:55.619
Clayton!

33:56.411 --> 33:58.205
Clayton! What the hell are you doing?

33:58.288 --> 33:59.414
I'm sorry, baby, all right?

33:59.498 --> 34:02.167
This is my world,
my life you're messing with.

34:03.168 --> 34:04.670
Get out of here now. All right?

34:05.921 --> 34:07.464
Go. I will meet you outside.

34:08.465 --> 34:09.550
Damn it.

34:13.303 --> 34:14.429
You are way outta line.

34:14.513 --> 34:15.722
I'm outta line?

34:15.806 --> 34:17.474
He has been home one day.

34:18.016 --> 34:20.185
I brought him here to get his mind off
what he's been through,

34:20.268 --> 34:22.603
and you just shoved his nose in it!

34:31.487 --> 34:32.572
Thanks for staying.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.201
You don't need to thank me.

34:38.954 --> 34:40.455
You know...

34:42.623 --> 34:45.878
Ed was shot down in Korea.

34:45.960 --> 34:50.007
For a week, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

34:52.259 --> 34:57.181
And I started having
a recurring nightmare.

34:59.308 --> 35:00.559
So you do dream.

35:02.394 --> 35:03.478
Yeah.

35:03.562 --> 35:04.897
How long did that go on?

35:06.857 --> 35:08.442
It's still going on.

35:10.152 --> 35:12.279
Anytime Ed goes into space.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.742
I never told him about it.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.204
I don't know. I just...

35:22.289 --> 35:24.416
I don't know why I'm telling you.

35:25.959 --> 35:28.253
No. Please tell me everything.

35:29.463 --> 35:31.256
It helps to say it out loud.

35:34.301 --> 35:35.594
What's the dream?

35:44.436 --> 35:46.563
Well, I'm running through a jungle...

35:48.106 --> 35:52.903
and I'm being chased by an animal.

35:54.780 --> 35:58.659
I can't see it,
but I can hear it growling at me.

36:00.369 --> 36:04.373
And I run and run and run...

36:06.333 --> 36:09.461
and run until I reach this clearing.

36:16.301 --> 36:17.469
And then?

36:17.553 --> 36:20.556
No. What's the point of this? Honestly.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.852
Look...

36:25.310 --> 36:28.605
Just tell me. What's in the clearing?

36:35.863 --> 36:37.197
This panther.

36:39.241 --> 36:43.078
Black as night
with big, glowing yellow eyes.

36:46.832 --> 36:48.959
And it's feeding on Ed.

36:51.086 --> 36:53.005
Eating his entrails.

36:53.714 --> 36:55.424
But Ed is still alive.

36:57.759 --> 37:00.262
And he's looking at me.

37:01.013 --> 37:04.683
And he's so scared.
He's so scared, like a little boy.

37:04.766 --> 37:08.187
And he's calling out to me,
and I can't help him.

37:11.315 --> 37:12.399
Shit.

37:13.942 --> 37:15.110
Shit, I'm sorry.

37:15.194 --> 37:19.114
I'm so sorry.
I did not come here to do this. I'm...

37:19.823 --> 37:20.866
Yes, you did.

37:23.493 --> 37:24.661
Yes, you did.

37:28.290 --> 37:29.291
Yeah.

37:41.386 --> 37:44.973
I gotta thank you for going to bat for me
on the whole diaper thing.

37:45.057 --> 37:48.977
I gotta say, a Gemini bag was not
what I had in mind to replace it.

37:49.603 --> 37:51.522
Thought you were looking for equality.

37:52.898 --> 37:55.567
Me and Gordo had to use those
for two weeks on Gemini 7.

37:55.651 --> 37:57.694
Well, thank you for that image.

37:57.778 --> 37:59.613
Yeah, the frogmen who pulled us
out of the spacecraft,

37:59.696 --> 38:01.490
they said it smelled like a latrine.

38:03.784 --> 38:04.993
It was bad.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.208
Bible says it's bedtime.

38:16.672 --> 38:19.550
Houston,
I think we're ready to call it a day.

38:19.633 --> 38:20.634
Roger, Shackleton.

38:21.468 --> 38:23.971
<i>And we'd like to leave
the sensors off tonight</i>.

38:24.555 --> 38:26.181
<i>Surgeon's okay with that.</i>

38:26.807 --> 38:29.893
Hey, Shane, buddy.
I hope you're listening.

38:30.644 --> 38:33.397
I did something special today
just for you.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.525
<i>I wrote your name
on the surface of the moon.</i>

38:37.067 --> 38:39.528
It's going to be there
for millions of years.

38:39.611 --> 38:41.071
Long after both of us are gone.

38:41.864 --> 38:43.574
That is so bitchin'.

38:47.578 --> 38:48.996
Good night, Karen.

38:49.454 --> 38:50.956
<i>I miss you both.</i>

38:51.039 --> 38:52.082
We miss you too.

39:23.864 --> 39:25.032
You asleep?

39:27.868 --> 39:28.869
No.

39:29.912 --> 39:32.789
It was nice.
That thing you did for your kid.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.044
It's bullshit.

39:38.754 --> 39:43.509
I'm a great one for grand gestures,
but on the everyday stuff...

39:46.386 --> 39:47.679
Never had a kid.

39:49.139 --> 39:51.016
They look like a lot of work.

39:58.815 --> 39:59.900
I'm...

40:01.777 --> 40:06.532
just not good at the dad thing, you know?

40:07.324 --> 40:08.492
What's the dad thing?

40:11.411 --> 40:14.831
Like... teaching him how to ride a bike.

40:14.915 --> 40:19.169
I mean, I totally fucked that up.

40:20.212 --> 40:22.881
Really? You're not a bad teacher.

40:24.216 --> 40:25.968
Even when I get pissy with you.

40:26.802 --> 40:30.848
That's my job. It's different with Shane.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.058
Different how?

40:34.268 --> 40:35.519
Like with the bike.

40:37.354 --> 40:40.357
He got... flustered...

40:42.693 --> 40:43.735
and scared.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.449
And that just made me angry.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.330
And Deke came by the house, so...

40:57.833 --> 41:00.127
it gave me an excuse to walk away.

41:04.214 --> 41:05.257
I just...

41:11.722 --> 41:15.809
I just left him... standing there.

41:20.647 --> 41:22.816
I'll never forget the look on his face.

41:26.445 --> 41:28.030
I remember thinking...

41:30.824 --> 41:32.701
"What the hell's wrong with me?"

41:37.206 --> 41:38.665
You're a selfish prick.

41:40.959 --> 41:42.044
So am I.

41:44.963 --> 41:46.632
You know, when I got this flight...

41:49.843 --> 41:51.470
Wayne was terrified.

41:53.347 --> 41:54.598
But I wanted it.

41:56.558 --> 41:59.811
So I let him think I couldn't see through
his brave front.

42:03.607 --> 42:05.943
I chose to let him be terrified...

42:07.027 --> 42:09.029
so that I could go to the moon.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.033
That's pretty selfish.

42:15.244 --> 42:18.956
Oh, Karen's been going through that
for years.

42:20.207 --> 42:21.333
Since Korea.

42:25.796 --> 42:26.922
Face it.

42:30.551 --> 42:34.847
We are egomaniacal narcissists.

42:36.181 --> 42:40.978
I bet Columbus was... and Magellan.
And they had to be to do what they did.

42:41.478 --> 42:43.605
I say here's to selfish pricks.

42:44.523 --> 42:47.150
'Cause we move the ball forward
for mankind.

43:00.956 --> 43:05.544
<i>Mr. Administrator, we're well into
the final moonwalk and still no ice.</i>

43:05.627 --> 43:08.547
<i>Do you believe Apollo 15
will come home empty-handed?</i>

43:08.630 --> 43:12.384
<i>No. I am confident the ice is there
and that our astronauts will find it.</i>

43:12.467 --> 43:14.011
I think we should pull the plug.

43:14.094 --> 43:17.389
Our best option is to send Apollo 16
back there with climbing gear

43:17.472 --> 43:19.516
so we can explore the crater itself.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.685
Yeah,
I don't think that's the best option.

43:21.768 --> 43:23.645
In fact, it's a shitty option.

43:23.729 --> 43:26.356
If we wait for Apollo 16,
the Russians will win this.

43:26.982 --> 43:28.692
You want to explain that to the president?

43:33.906 --> 43:36.909
Then let's quit wasting their time.
Get 'em into the crater.

43:36.992 --> 43:38.994
It's three times deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

43:39.077 --> 43:40.537
How far do they need to go?

43:42.039 --> 43:44.875
A hundred meters should put us
into the cold trap,

43:44.958 --> 43:47.419
where there's been no sunlight
for two billion years.

43:47.753 --> 43:50.297
If there is ice, that's the sweet spot.

43:51.215 --> 43:53.759
As you can see, it's pretty damn steep.

43:53.842 --> 43:57.346
I mean, we can get down there,
but the question is if we can get back up.

43:57.429 --> 43:59.223
<i>Guys are working on that right now.</i>

43:59.306 --> 44:01.058
And we've only got so much O2.

44:03.018 --> 44:04.603
Wish I had my old pickup.

44:04.686 --> 44:07.981
Had a winch. Be perfect for this.

44:09.900 --> 44:13.445
A winch is just an axle
with some cable, right?

44:25.040 --> 44:27.042
And we got a buttload of S band cable.

44:27.793 --> 44:29.211
Question is if it can hold us.

44:30.963 --> 44:32.381
Wanna roll a hard six?

44:35.342 --> 44:38.011
Houston, can we make a winch
out of the rover?

44:40.180 --> 44:43.976
<i>I gotta admit, wrecking
government property is kinda fun.</i>

44:44.059 --> 44:46.520
<i>You might not think it's as much fun
on the hike back.</i>

44:46.603 --> 44:48.522
<i>Why not? It's a nice day.</i>

44:48.605 --> 44:49.815
Flight, their increased activity

44:49.898 --> 44:52.526
is going through their oxygen
a lot faster than we planned.

44:52.609 --> 44:55.279
Okay. It's a three-kilometer walk back
to the LEM.

44:55.362 --> 44:56.947
Let me know when it's time
to pull the plug.

44:57.030 --> 44:58.365
Roger that, Flight.

45:06.081 --> 45:07.416
That's a good speed.

45:08.667 --> 45:10.377
Now, when I hook up and head down...

45:11.336 --> 45:12.921
I want you to keep both hands on the cable

45:13.005 --> 45:14.923
just in case something happens, okay?

45:15.549 --> 45:17.634
You're not thinking this through, boss.

45:17.718 --> 45:20.220
I learned to climb rocks
back in Camp Fire Girls.

45:20.304 --> 45:23.765
And I climbed ropes at the academy.
End of discussion.

45:23.849 --> 45:27.769
We got a technical problem,
and it doesn't care who's boss.

45:28.270 --> 45:30.522
This rig's nowhere near as strong
as the one on your truck.

45:30.606 --> 45:33.859
And even in one-sixth G,
I weigh half as much as you do.

45:35.569 --> 45:38.572
You really want this skinny girl
belaying your fat ass?

45:39.573 --> 45:40.782
Send me down.

45:41.909 --> 45:44.119
<i>Boeing concurs with Molly, Ed.</i>

45:44.203 --> 45:46.205
<i>But you know they're just
trying to minimize their risk.</i>

45:46.288 --> 45:47.748
<i>So, it's your call.</i>

45:49.124 --> 45:51.585
I can do this. Trust me.

45:55.380 --> 45:59.885
<i>You know, a few years ago it would have
been inconceivable for NASA</i>

45:59.968 --> 46:02.763
<i>to approve such a precarious undertaking.</i>

46:03.180 --> 46:05.641
<i>But in the race for the first moon base,</i>

46:05.724 --> 46:09.269
<i>Mission Control has thrown
caution to the wind.</i>

46:10.020 --> 46:11.980
<i>In the shadow of Apollo 10,</i>

46:12.064 --> 46:15.526
<i>and the "culture of caution"
widely criticized...</i>

46:15.609 --> 46:16.652
Excuse me.

46:16.735 --> 46:18.195
<i>...in the wake of the first
Soviet lunar landing...</i>

46:22.616 --> 46:23.825
Late again, huh?

46:23.909 --> 46:25.869
Didn't want to disappoint you.

46:28.247 --> 46:29.414
I brought you something.

46:34.127 --> 46:36.129
I spent all day on it.
It's from your dream.

46:36.213 --> 46:39.174
Yeah. I know what it's from.

46:40.342 --> 46:41.552
Thank you.

46:41.635 --> 46:42.845
You're very welcome.

46:43.971 --> 46:45.931
Look, we should get to the TV.

46:46.014 --> 46:48.475
Molly's going down
into the Shackleton Crater right now.

46:48.559 --> 46:50.477
Wait, what? That's...
When did this happen?

46:50.561 --> 46:52.437
It's okay. Come in.
I'll explain. I'll explain.

46:52.521 --> 46:57.609
<i>You know, typically, astronauts train
for years before a trip to the moon.</i>

46:57.693 --> 47:02.948
<i>They do practice procedures for every
minuscule aspect of their missions,</i>

47:03.031 --> 47:04.908
<i>no detail left to chance.</i>

47:05.868 --> 47:07.536
<i>Against this backdrop,</i>

47:07.619 --> 47:11.915
<i>Cobb and Baldwin's decision
to undertake this complex,</i>

47:11.999 --> 47:16.587
<i>unplanned maneuver is
a bold and unprecedented choice.</i>

47:27.014 --> 47:28.682
Houston, we are in place for descent.

47:29.683 --> 47:31.435
<i>Roger, Ed. You are go for descent.</i>

47:32.603 --> 47:33.937
You ready, Mol?

47:35.063 --> 47:36.148
Belay on.

47:36.732 --> 47:37.733
Slack.

47:46.408 --> 47:48.702
Molly is now out of sight in the crater.

48:02.799 --> 48:04.009
Easy, Ed.

48:09.181 --> 48:13.060
<i>Supported only by a thin electrical cable,
Astronaut Cobb is now descending...</i>

48:13.143 --> 48:16.188
What if the cable breaks?
That crater's miles deep.

48:16.563 --> 48:19.525
Hey, Wayne. Breathe.

48:20.234 --> 48:22.569
<i>Molly, your transmission
dropped out a little.</i>

48:22.819 --> 48:24.196
<i>Roger drop out.</i>

48:24.279 --> 48:25.656
<i>Albedo's pretty uniform.</i>

48:26.240 --> 48:28.825
I'm not seeing much
in the way of impact melts.

48:29.451 --> 48:30.452
Tension.

48:30.536 --> 48:31.537
Gotcha.

48:32.162 --> 48:35.666
I'm heading into the darkness now.
I'm gonna go slow from here.

48:36.041 --> 48:37.084
Roger slow.

48:43.924 --> 48:45.175
Slower.

48:47.135 --> 48:49.221
-Tension.
-Gotcha.

49:01.733 --> 49:03.026
Letting my eyes adjust.

49:03.443 --> 49:05.571
Mol? Would you check your video?

49:08.824 --> 49:09.825
<i>How's that?</i>

49:09.908 --> 49:11.535
Okay, we're good.

49:14.413 --> 49:18.917
<i>Not much to see.
Just rocky outcroppings. Not much dust.</i>

49:19.293 --> 49:20.711
<i>Ed, lower.</i>

49:35.267 --> 49:36.268
Tension.

49:36.351 --> 49:37.352
Gotcha.

49:38.812 --> 49:42.316
Thirty meters from the rim.
Might as well get a baseline here.

49:52.117 --> 49:53.493
You okay, Mol?

49:56.205 --> 49:57.414
Molly?

49:59.875 --> 50:01.001
Mol, you okay?

50:03.879 --> 50:06.507
<i>Yeah, things just got away
from me a little.</i>

50:06.798 --> 50:08.550
<i>Okay, let's see what we got.</i>

50:09.301 --> 50:13.138
There's not much dust.
This is basalt, I think.

50:14.014 --> 50:16.016
No, breccia. This is bedrock.

50:16.433 --> 50:17.809
No ice.

50:17.893 --> 50:21.063
Let me try again in another 20 feet.
Lower.

50:25.567 --> 50:27.945
Flight, Molly's O2 consumption is
higher than expected.

50:28.320 --> 50:30.614
I'm concerned she won't have enough
to search much longer.

50:31.031 --> 50:32.824
How much time do you figure?

50:32.908 --> 50:35.327
At their current rate of consumption,
about two minutes, max.

50:35.410 --> 50:38.288
And that's cutting it close.
They have a long walk back.

50:38.372 --> 50:40.541
No telling what can screw up on the way.

50:42.042 --> 50:43.502
How long can this go on?

50:44.086 --> 50:46.380
They only have 300 feet of cable, so...

50:46.463 --> 50:47.673
300.

50:48.257 --> 50:49.675
Here.

50:49.758 --> 50:51.009
Please.

50:56.723 --> 50:59.643
That's the end of the line, Molly.
What you see is what you get.

51:00.227 --> 51:03.397
Roger. I'm gonna give both sides a whack.

51:10.112 --> 51:11.280
<i>No joy.</i>

51:11.363 --> 51:14.157
<i>Hammer's just giving me
four centimeters of penetration.</i>

51:14.616 --> 51:18.495
<i>It's just more basalt. Still no ice.</i>

51:18.579 --> 51:20.330
That's it, Flight. Time's up.

51:20.414 --> 51:21.582
Wrap it up, Fred.

51:22.457 --> 51:24.668
Ed, Molly, you are bingo on O2.

51:24.751 --> 51:26.753
<i>We'd like you to knock it off
and head back up.</i>

51:29.173 --> 51:30.257
Negative, Houston.

51:30.757 --> 51:32.384
I wanna try something else here.

51:32.801 --> 51:34.303
I'm pulling you back up.

51:34.386 --> 51:35.804
I need more time.

51:36.430 --> 51:38.432
Don't make me drag you up those rocks.

51:39.433 --> 51:40.767
<i>You don't wanna do that, Ed.</i>

51:40.851 --> 51:42.477
What the hell is she doing?

51:42.561 --> 51:45.772
Her heart rate's up to 170.
She's sucking O2 like crazy. This is done.

51:45.856 --> 51:46.857
Flight?

51:48.317 --> 51:51.028
That's a no-go, Molly.
Molly, it's time to come home.

51:53.322 --> 51:56.158
Say again, Houston.
Couldn't hear anything after "that."

51:56.241 --> 51:57.951
This is amateur bullshit.

51:58.035 --> 52:01.121
Flight, she's gonna get herself killed
and take Baldwin with her.

52:01.205 --> 52:03.874
-Fred!
-Molly, stop screwing around.

52:03.957 --> 52:05.834
Molly, you've proved everything
you need to prove.

52:06.877 --> 52:08.253
Time to come back up.

52:13.008 --> 52:14.134
You hear me, Mol?

52:27.564 --> 52:29.149
Molly, do you read?

52:33.237 --> 52:36.073
Roger. Just one more thing to do.

52:36.657 --> 52:39.076
All right, I'm giving you 30 seconds,
then I'm hauling you back up.

52:40.285 --> 52:41.286
Deal.

53:03.475 --> 53:06.478
<i>Houston, are you getting this on-screen?</i>

53:06.562 --> 53:07.729
Roger, Molly.

53:18.991 --> 53:20.450
Looks like you were right, Ray.

53:21.201 --> 53:24.705
That's... It could be...
That could be ice.

53:24.788 --> 53:27.583
<i>Folks here are gonna want you
to bring that back for testing.</i>

53:27.666 --> 53:29.334
Yeah, I figured.

53:31.253 --> 53:32.671
But here's the clincher.

53:41.889 --> 53:43.807
Oh, my God.

53:45.976 --> 53:50.522
<i>It looks like we have ourselves
a lava tube full of ice.</i>

53:50.606 --> 53:52.649
Oh, my God. No way.

53:54.985 --> 53:57.404
-Get Molly out of there now.
-Yeah.

53:57.487 --> 53:58.572
Ed, pull her up.

53:58.655 --> 53:59.698
Roger. Move it, Molly.

54:01.408 --> 54:04.161
Yeah, what are you waiting for?
Start me up.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.336
Damn, you put on weight down there?

54:14.546 --> 54:17.966
<i>Oh, that's right. Woman does all the work
and then the man complains.</i>

54:18.050 --> 54:19.426
Fred.

54:19.510 --> 54:21.595
Tell them to can the chatter,
preserve the O2.

54:22.346 --> 54:25.349
They can jaw it up all they want
when they get to the LEM.

54:25.432 --> 54:27.017
<i>Water on the moon.</i>

54:27.267 --> 54:30.395
<i>NASA's dangerous gamble
seems to have paid off.</i>

54:30.771 --> 54:35.359
<i>Shackleton Crater may well be
the site of America's first lunar base.</i>

54:52.501 --> 54:53.710
<i>They're in.</i>

54:54.086 --> 54:58.006
<i>They're back inside the LEM,
and they appear to be safe and sound.</i>

54:58.090 --> 55:00.467
-They're good, buddy.
-<i>Just incredible.</i>

55:01.093 --> 55:03.595
-Just gonna throw up.
-Yeah, it's been a day, right?

55:03.971 --> 55:05.389
-Let's get a drink.
-Yes.

55:06.348 --> 55:09.560
<i>...with their discovery
of lunar ice in tow.</i>

55:11.311 --> 55:12.896
The press is on your front lawn.

55:12.980 --> 55:15.774
Don't think they're going anywhere
until they get a statement from us.

55:16.316 --> 55:18.443
Well, let us go amongst them.

55:19.111 --> 55:22.281
Maybe you two should go.
I've never really talked to the press.

55:22.364 --> 55:24.658
Nonsense. You'll do just fine. Come on.

55:26.410 --> 55:27.411
Okay.

55:47.556 --> 55:49.933
Never knew it could feel so amazing
just to breathe.

55:51.268 --> 55:53.896
Houston, you guys don't know
how good you got it.

55:53.979 --> 55:57.441
Actually, I think we do.
Even Margo's smiling.

55:58.108 --> 56:00.402
<i>Oh, wow. Someone get a photo of that.</i>

56:03.030 --> 56:06.325
Doc Chase has insisted that we amend
your timeline by 15 minutes

56:06.408 --> 56:08.452
to give you a moment to just breathe.

56:08.535 --> 56:12.414
Get some oxygen into your system.
He's also keen that you rehydrate.

56:12.497 --> 56:14.208
-<i>That we can do.</i>
-<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

56:25.177 --> 56:26.178
What?

56:28.972 --> 56:30.766
I gotta see what it was all for.

56:52.037 --> 56:53.413
It's melting.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.802
Seahawk,<i> you are go for liftoff.</i>

57:07.386 --> 57:08.387
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

57:08.470 --> 57:11.682
<i>We got the goodies in the freezer,
and we are ready to do some flying.</i>

57:12.516 --> 57:14.017
<i>Guidance steering is in.</i>

57:14.434 --> 57:16.395
<i>Okay. Master Arm is on.</i>

57:18.355 --> 57:19.690
<i>Good liftoff.</i>

57:19.773 --> 57:20.941
<i>Right on profile.</i>

57:21.024 --> 57:23.694
<i>Boy, what a view of the crater.</i>

57:29.199 --> 57:30.826
<i>Trajectory is good, Flight.</i>

57:30.909 --> 57:32.995
<i>Right down the pipe. On schedule.</i>

57:37.624 --> 57:40.294
<i>Seventy-eight hours, 33 minutes.</i>

57:40.377 --> 57:43.130
<i>Remote guidance is on target.</i>

57:45.757 --> 57:47.384
<i>Looks like the habitation module</i>

57:47.467 --> 57:50.512
<i>just flew over
the Apollo 15 LEM descent stage.</i>

57:50.596 --> 57:53.307
<i>Two fifty at 15. Fuel 12 percent.</i>

57:55.893 --> 57:59.229
<i>One sixty, three feet per second down.
Fifty feet.</i>

58:02.441 --> 58:03.901
<i>Two feet per second.</i>

58:05.611 --> 58:10.282
<i>Contact light. Engine cutoff.
Touchdown confirmed.</i>

58:11.200 --> 58:12.534
<i>Copy that, FIDO.</i>

58:12.618 --> 58:15.787
<i>Jamestown Base has landed
on the edge of Shackleton Crater.</i>

58:16.330 --> 58:19.416
<i>Let's leave the lights on for the boys
on Apollo 21.</i>
