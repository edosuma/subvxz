WEBVTT

00:00.985 --> 00:03.486
- Taylor wants to get
the advice column going again.

00:03.487 --> 00:05.363
- I don't feel like
the same person

00:05.364 --> 00:06.948
who wrote that anymore.

00:06.949 --> 00:08.366
- I'd love for you
to still write it

00:08.367 --> 00:09.784
as whoever you are now.

00:09.785 --> 00:10.994
- I'll think about it.

00:10.995 --> 00:13.204
- Rogue is not the only one
who's on Prozac.

00:13.205 --> 00:15.248
I've been taking it on and off
since I was in college

00:15.249 --> 00:16.749
for depression.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.376
Sometimes, it gets bad.

00:18.377 --> 00:19.461
I-I need you to understand

00:19.462 --> 00:20.878
that this isn't fixable.

00:20.879 --> 00:22.131
- You were weird at the party,

00:22.132 --> 00:23.631
and now you want
to go straight to bed.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.258
- You know, what never
makes me feel better

00:25.259 --> 00:27.051
is when my wife yells at me.

00:27.052 --> 00:29.011
- I'm not yelling at...

00:29.012 --> 00:30.305
You were right.

00:30.306 --> 00:32.473
There was a lot about him

00:32.474 --> 00:34.434
I didn't know.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.686
- You've done
that hike a hundred times.

00:36.687 --> 00:38.354
I want to believe
this was an accident,

00:38.355 --> 00:40.022
but I'm standing here,
looking down,

00:40.023 --> 00:41.607
and I just don't know.

00:49.742 --> 00:51.534
It was late in the afternoon,

00:51.535 --> 00:53.536
and I was...

00:53.537 --> 00:55.079
folding laundry,

00:55.080 --> 00:56.914
just trying to distract myself
from worrying,

00:56.915 --> 00:59.584
and I had all these, um,

00:59.585 --> 01:01.669
single, mismatched socks

01:01.670 --> 01:04.464
on my lap.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.925
I... I didn't want to be wasteful
and throw them away,

01:07.926 --> 01:09.635
even though I was never
gonna wear them

01:09.636 --> 01:12.138
without their matching pairs.

01:12.139 --> 01:16.142
Anyway, I, uh...

01:16.143 --> 01:19.187
I was leaving, uh,
another message

01:19.188 --> 01:21.397
when I got a call from...

01:21.398 --> 01:23.567
a number
I didn't recognize.

01:26.070 --> 01:27.946
It was
the sheriff's department.

01:32.242 --> 01:37.205
They told me that there
had been an accident,

01:37.206 --> 01:40.041
and that my husband's body

01:40.042 --> 01:43.753
had been found
near the hiking trail

01:43.754 --> 01:48.634
at the... bottom
of a 42-foot drop.

01:52.429 --> 01:55.724
He had slipped
or tripped.

02:00.479 --> 02:04.440
And I just sat there...

02:04.441 --> 02:07.027
with all these socks
on my lap.

02:13.158 --> 02:16.494
Yeah, I thought that I...
I had experienced

02:16.495 --> 02:20.706
every possible... emotion

02:20.707 --> 02:23.292
since that day,

02:23.293 --> 02:25.336
but today is a new one.

02:27.047 --> 02:30.508
T-today, I feel stupid,

02:30.509 --> 02:32.718
because I-I heard something

02:32.719 --> 02:35.888
from someone who knew him
just as well as I did,

02:35.889 --> 02:39.976
and this person doesn't think
that it was...

02:39.977 --> 02:42.770
an accident.

02:42.771 --> 02:45.232
He thinks it was a choice.

02:49.486 --> 02:54.157
I have spent four months

02:54.158 --> 02:58.453
blaming the universe.

02:58.454 --> 03:01.789
And maybe

03:01.790 --> 03:04.500
the one I really
should be angry with

03:04.501 --> 03:06.128
is Matt.

03:10.299 --> 03:13.384
- Thank you for sharing.

03:13.385 --> 03:16.013
Is there anything else
that you want to say?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.058
- Tomorrow's my birthday.

03:33.530 --> 03:34.782
- I thought you said
processed sugar

03:34.783 --> 03:36.365
cuts lifespans in half.

03:36.366 --> 03:40.078
- Well, today is a day
for exceptions.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.332
- Now, honey, you need
to be patient with her.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.000
She might be
a bit difficult.

03:46.001 --> 03:47.252
- She's always
a bit difficult.

03:47.253 --> 03:49.003
- So get ready
for a lot of difficult.

03:49.004 --> 03:50.379
Hey, hey!

03:50.380 --> 03:52.131
- Hi!
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.466
- Hello.
- Thank you.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.635
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you very much.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.513
Do I smell "queenie-a-mans"?

03:58.514 --> 03:59.972
- Yeah.
- "Queens-a-ma"?

03:59.973 --> 04:02.433
- If you can't pronounce it,
the calories don't count.

04:05.896 --> 04:07.563
Happy birthday.

04:07.564 --> 04:10.274
Thank you.
A coupon book!

04:10.275 --> 04:11.943
Fun.

04:11.944 --> 04:13.277
"I will restart the book club

04:13.278 --> 04:15.071
"you tried to get me and Mom
to do

04:15.072 --> 04:16.406
and actually read the books
this time."

04:16.407 --> 04:19.158
This is a brilliant gift!
Thank you, Jules.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.285
I love this! Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

04:21.286 --> 04:22.496
- Thank you so much.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.208
You okay?

04:27.209 --> 04:29.127
- Yeah, no, I-I am.

04:29.128 --> 04:31.546
I just... I just... I didn't think

04:31.547 --> 04:33.172
you'd be doing
quite so well today.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.049
That's all.

04:35.050 --> 04:36.717
- I didn't either,
but we all make choices,

04:36.718 --> 04:39.137
and I am choosing
to have a great birthday.

04:39.138 --> 04:40.389
So let's do this thing!

04:40.390 --> 04:42.432
- Okay, let's do this, um.

04:42.433 --> 04:45.226
I got Lacey to take
the evening classes

04:45.227 --> 04:47.770
so we can get to Sugarfish
before the lines get crazy,

04:47.771 --> 04:51.023
and then, they are screening
"The Philadelphia Story"

04:51.024 --> 04:52.025
at the Egyptian.

04:54.445 --> 04:57.405
I think I want a party.
- Oh, you do?

04:57.406 --> 04:58.407
- I do.

04:58.408 --> 04:59.782
- A party.
- Mm-hm.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.826
Tonight.
I want a party.

05:01.827 --> 05:03.619
Like, a big party.

05:03.620 --> 05:07.039
- Okay, um...

05:07.040 --> 05:09.041
Do you want me to call Drew
and a few of your friends?

05:09.042 --> 05:11.085
- No, you don't have to.
I can do that,

05:11.086 --> 05:12.503
and, um, it's my birthday,

05:12.504 --> 05:14.714
so I get to eat
six fun things.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.424
- Um, five.

05:16.425 --> 05:18.050
- Um, four.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.635
- I'm gonna eat
four fun things!

05:19.636 --> 05:22.972
Jules, I thank you.

05:22.973 --> 05:24.767
I thank you.

05:27.853 --> 05:30.521
Uh, uh, remind your friends
it's a sober house.

05:30.522 --> 05:34.567
Okay?
- Gotcha.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.194
- Stop worrying.
- Uh-uh.

05:36.195 --> 05:38.154
- Stop.
- Oh, my god.

05:38.155 --> 05:40.823
- She's fine.
I'm fine.

05:40.824 --> 05:43.701
You're fine.
- Okay.

05:43.702 --> 05:45.704
Okay.
- We're fine.

06:15.651 --> 06:17.152
Okay.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.378
Frankie, hey.

06:35.379 --> 06:37.880
- Hey, Leigh, happy birthday.

06:37.881 --> 06:41.092
Um, I-I know we haven't talked
in a while,

06:41.093 --> 06:43.261
but, um, I just got
your invite,

06:43.262 --> 06:45.221
and I wanted to make sure...
- Oh, great.

06:45.222 --> 06:48.224
Uh, yeah.
Are you... coming?

06:48.225 --> 06:50.685
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
I'm there.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.353
- Okay, great.
- Awesome.

06:52.354 --> 06:54.105
I'm super excited.
Birthday time.

06:54.106 --> 06:55.232
Woot, woot!

06:55.233 --> 06:56.733
- Woot, woot!

06:56.734 --> 06:59.153
Okay, I will see you there.
Bye!

07:13.917 --> 07:16.461
- Hey, happy birthday!

07:16.462 --> 07:17.629
- Thank you!

07:17.629 --> 07:18.839
- What, uh...
what are you doing here?

07:18.840 --> 07:21.174
- I just wanted to see
my best friend on my birthday.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.592
Did you get me a present yet?

07:22.593 --> 07:25.887
- No, but spoiler:
I am getting you a gift card

07:25.888 --> 07:27.930
because I know how you love
picking out your own presents.

07:27.931 --> 07:29.599
- It's true.
I do.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.227
But, you know, anyone
can get me a gift card,

07:33.228 --> 07:36.439
whereas you can...

07:36.440 --> 07:39.109
give me my column back.

07:42.154 --> 07:43.905
- Leigh, I've been trying to
give you your column back

07:43.906 --> 07:47.158
for months.
- I... I know you waited on me,

07:47.159 --> 07:49.327
and the good news is...
is that I'm done

07:49.328 --> 07:51.788
putting my life on hold,
and I'm ready to do this.

07:51.789 --> 07:52.998
- That's great.
- Yeah.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.874
- And I wish I could,

07:54.875 --> 07:56.459
but...

07:56.460 --> 07:59.295
I can't take "Ask a Human"
away from Millie.

07:59.296 --> 08:01.130
- But can you please?
Like, just for the...

08:01.131 --> 08:02.673
the integrity of the Internet?

08:05.844 --> 08:08.429
Ah, "Advice on How to Nail
This Whole Adulting Thing,"

08:08.430 --> 08:10.431
by Millie Lloyd-Hughes.

08:10.432 --> 08:12.308
"Caffeinate responsibly.

08:12.309 --> 08:14.185
Learn what a W-2 is."
- Leigh...

08:14.186 --> 08:16.187
- "Wear sunscreen."
I mean, is this really

08:16.188 --> 08:17.481
the advice
that the world needs?

08:17.482 --> 08:19.190
- Leigh, could you not
mock-read my employees, okay?

08:19.191 --> 08:20.192
We don't have doors.

08:20.192 --> 08:21.402
- She's barely out of college.

08:21.403 --> 08:23.986
It's insane to have her
give advice,

08:23.987 --> 08:26.614
and what life experience
is she drawing on,

08:26.615 --> 08:29.242
the disappointing sex
she had on prom night?

08:29.243 --> 08:31.744
Okay, Millie is young,

08:31.745 --> 08:35.415
but her posts
do really well.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.250
Her adulting advice went viral.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.793
- And so did white supremacy.

08:38.794 --> 08:40.962
- Nice.
- Just saying.

08:40.963 --> 08:43.589
Her advice is listicles

08:43.590 --> 08:46.092
and GIFs and... ,

08:46.093 --> 08:47.552
and when I gave advice,

08:47.553 --> 08:50.179
I-I-I took my heart out
of my chest,

08:50.180 --> 08:51.807
and then I put it
on the screen.

08:53.183 --> 08:54.767
- Leigh...

08:54.768 --> 08:57.228
I wish we could pick up
where we left off, but...

08:57.229 --> 08:59.188
our editorial director
made our weekly meeting

08:59.189 --> 09:00.898
all about Millie's column.

09:00.899 --> 09:02.525
Yeah, he got her a sheet cake

09:02.526 --> 09:03.652
that said "Viral."

09:03.653 --> 09:05.570
- That means nothing.

09:05.571 --> 09:06.822
- I'm just saying...
- Okay.

09:06.822 --> 09:08.115
I... I can't

09:08.116 --> 09:10.575
get your column back
after that meeting.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.620
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.873
I hate how this went down,

09:16.874 --> 09:19.083
but...

09:19.084 --> 09:21.627
- You should get that.
- I'm sorry. Okay.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.088
But, uh, I'll see you
tonight, though, yeah?

09:24.089 --> 09:25.757
- Um, yes.

09:25.758 --> 09:27.508
Thank you for hearing me out.
I'll see you tonight.

09:27.509 --> 09:29.969
- Of course.
- Okay.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.221
- Happy birthday.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.889
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's gonna be fun!

09:32.890 --> 09:34.183
- It's gonna be... fun.

09:34.183 --> 09:35.225
- Okay.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.101
Can't wait.

09:37.102 --> 09:38.479
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:41.523 --> 09:43.316
- Pull your knee
into your chest,

09:43.317 --> 09:46.194
and breathe.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.571
Switch legs,
left over right.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.491
Lying on your back...

09:51.492 --> 09:53.785
cross your right foot
over your left knee

09:53.786 --> 09:55.328
for a quickie core stretch.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.497
- Richard, it's her birthday.

09:57.498 --> 09:59.082
If she doesn't want
to take your call,

09:59.083 --> 10:00.125
I am not going to make her.

10:00.126 --> 10:01.793
- Uh, hi, Amy.

10:01.794 --> 10:03.503
I'm well.
Thanks for asking.

10:03.504 --> 10:05.421
How are you?
- Amazing, obviously.

10:05.422 --> 10:07.548
- I got an invitation

10:07.549 --> 10:11.511
to Leigh's party
at your house tonight.

10:11.512 --> 10:12.970
- Well, you're her father.

10:12.971 --> 10:14.472
I've never stopped you
coming before.

10:14.473 --> 10:17.058
It's... it's not just me.

10:17.059 --> 10:19.435
My cousins in Florida
got one, too.

10:19.436 --> 10:23.022
She even invited
The Schwab.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.816
- The kid who ran
through your screen door

10:24.817 --> 10:26.442
at Leigh's high school
graduation party?

10:26.443 --> 10:28.945
- There's still a kink
in the frame.

10:28.946 --> 10:30.488
- How many people
did she invite?

10:30.489 --> 10:32.949
- It's just pages
of names.

10:32.950 --> 10:35.368
Amy?

10:35.369 --> 10:38.204
Hello?
- What? 600...

10:38.205 --> 10:41.749
- You there?

10:41.750 --> 10:43.960
- Thank you.

10:43.961 --> 10:46.963
- Leigh.
- What?

10:46.964 --> 10:48.881
- Are you okay?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.925
- Yeah.
Why?

10:50.926 --> 10:53.886
- You've invited 657 people

10:53.887 --> 10:55.263
to my house tonight.

10:55.264 --> 10:57.181
- Well, it's a last-minute
invite on a Tuesday.

10:57.182 --> 10:58.350
If 30 people show up,
it's gonna be

10:58.350 --> 10:59.351
a Christmas miracle.

10:59.352 --> 11:02.019
- Honey, we stopped
throwing you parties

11:02.020 --> 11:03.272
after elementary school

11:03.273 --> 11:04.939
because the attention
made you self-conscious.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.900
- Well, I don't want
to be self-conscious anymore,

11:07.901 --> 11:10.486
or negative,
or judgmental,

11:10.487 --> 11:12.655
or sad.
I don't want to be that person.

11:12.656 --> 11:15.366
- But I like that person.
I love that person, in fact.

11:15.367 --> 11:17.244
- Well, I don't.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.876
- Honey, today was never
gonna be an easy day.

11:24.877 --> 11:26.377
Whatever you need to feel,

11:26.378 --> 11:27.463
you get to feel it.

11:27.464 --> 11:30.465
- Well, I feel like
trying something new

11:30.466 --> 11:33.009
and being a fun person

11:33.010 --> 11:35.845
who's really good
at parties,

11:35.846 --> 11:40.308
and you can... try
being a fun person at parties.

11:40.309 --> 11:42.685
That would be...
new for you, too.

11:42.686 --> 11:44.437
- You don't think
I'm fun at parties?

11:44.438 --> 11:47.691
- No.

11:59.411 --> 12:03.082
Send email
to Millie Lloyd-Hughes.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.668
Hey, Millie,
I need your advice.

12:07.669 --> 12:09.879
What do you do
when it's your birthday

12:09.880 --> 12:12.381
and you're another year older,
and you realize

12:12.382 --> 12:14.175
that you've made
absolutely no progress

12:14.176 --> 12:15.761
with anything important
in your life?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.223
Hey, Millie?

12:20.224 --> 12:22.391
Um...

12:22.392 --> 12:24.519
What do you do when...

12:24.520 --> 12:26.979
the advice column
that you started from nothing

12:26.980 --> 12:30.191
get stolen by a shallow,
boring 22-year-old

12:30.192 --> 12:32.276
whose idea of adversity

12:32.277 --> 12:34.488
is getting into
her second-choice college?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.409
Hey, Millie, what do you wear
to your first party

12:39.410 --> 12:41.452
after your husband
fell off the side of a mountain

12:41.453 --> 12:44.038
and died?
Send.

12:49.753 --> 12:51.170
Um...
- Hello.

12:56.301 --> 12:58.052
- I mean...
- No, it's a party.

12:58.053 --> 12:59.595
There's no such thing
as being late.

12:59.596 --> 13:00.889
You show up
when you show up.

13:00.890 --> 13:03.015
- Hi.
Come on in.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.685
- Thanks so much
for having us.

13:05.686 --> 13:07.645
I know we're late.
I'm sorry.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.021
Richard refused
to take a left turn

13:09.022 --> 13:10.065
as we drove here,

13:10.066 --> 13:12.316
so we had to make
three rights instead.

13:13.652 --> 13:14.778
- I can't believe
he's still doing that.

13:14.779 --> 13:16.904
- People that don't
take left turns live longer.

13:16.905 --> 13:18.322
It's a statistic.
- It's nonsense.

13:18.323 --> 13:20.491
- It's a statistic.
- It's nonsense.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.580
- Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

13:25.581 --> 13:27.248
- It's so weird.

13:27.249 --> 13:29.041
- Um, I couldn't find
the coupon

13:29.042 --> 13:30.418
for borrowing your clothes.

13:30.419 --> 13:31.712
- Oh, I only wore that dress

13:31.713 --> 13:33.421
the one time I was
a slutty Holly Golightly

13:33.422 --> 13:35.047
for Halloween,
so borrow away.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.175
- Cool.
- Looks good.

13:36.175 --> 13:37.176
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

13:37.176 --> 13:38.302
- Hey, Dad.

13:38.302 --> 13:39.428
- Happy birthday, honey!
- Hey, hi, hi!

13:39.429 --> 13:40.928
Hi!
It's good to see you.

13:40.929 --> 13:43.014
Hey.
It's a... check, right?

13:43.015 --> 13:44.390
- Yes, it is.
- Cool.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.933
Hi, Sabrina.
- Happy birthday.

13:45.934 --> 13:47.477
- Thank you.
- Hey!

13:47.478 --> 13:48.729
- Oh, hey.
- Happy birthday!

13:48.730 --> 13:50.730
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

13:50.731 --> 13:51.982
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you again.

13:51.983 --> 13:53.441
- Yeah.

13:53.442 --> 13:57.278
- Cool.
I'm going to put this away.

13:57.279 --> 13:58.780
I'm gonna put this away.

13:58.781 --> 13:59.990
- Hey, Amy.

13:59.991 --> 14:02.492
Uh, it's Nicholas Schwaback.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.827
Uh, Nick... Nick Schwaback.
I went to high school

14:04.828 --> 14:06.454
with Leigh.

14:06.455 --> 14:07.872
Uh, "The Schwab"?

14:07.873 --> 14:10.750
Oh, The Schwab.

14:10.751 --> 14:12.044
It's nice to see you.

14:12.045 --> 14:15.046
- My tribute
to the party goddesses.

14:15.047 --> 14:17.673
- Um, we said sober house
on the invite.

14:17.674 --> 14:19.175
- I-I thought
that was a joke.

14:19.176 --> 14:20.260
- No.
Please take it back

14:20.260 --> 14:21.345
to your car.

14:21.346 --> 14:22.804
- You got it, yeah.

14:22.805 --> 14:23.847
- Thanks.

14:30.062 --> 14:31.729
Hi!

14:31.730 --> 14:33.064
- Happy birthday, sweetie.

14:33.065 --> 14:34.816
- Oh, thanks.
- How are you holding up?

14:34.817 --> 14:36.526
- I'm great.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.820
Yeah.
- Oh, that's good.

14:37.820 --> 14:38.862
- Just great, thank you.
- Yeah.

14:38.863 --> 14:40.405
- Thanks.
It's good to see you.

14:40.406 --> 14:42.240
- Leigh!

14:42.241 --> 14:44.325
- Hey.
- Remember this?

14:44.326 --> 14:46.369
Oh, do I.

14:46.370 --> 14:47.870
- What... what is he doing?

14:47.871 --> 14:50.373
- It's a bit from high school
where he does a stupid dance

14:50.374 --> 14:52.959
until it's funny, and then
it becomes stupid again...

14:52.960 --> 14:54.752
- And stupid again...
- And then it becomes...

14:54.753 --> 14:56.004
Really funny.

14:56.005 --> 14:58.423
And then... yeah.

15:02.261 --> 15:04.929
- Hi.
Uh, Schwab, here, help my mom.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.264
- Sure.
- There you go.

15:06.265 --> 15:07.723
Tasks.
Cool.

15:07.724 --> 15:09.600
Hi.

15:09.601 --> 15:11.060
- Hey, it's the birthday girl.

15:11.061 --> 15:13.104
- Hi.
Hi.

15:13.105 --> 15:15.440
- Or should I say,

15:15.441 --> 15:17.608
teenage vampire?
- Oh, wow.

15:17.609 --> 15:18.902
Well, that's cool.
You got me an insult

15:18.902 --> 15:19.903
for my birthday.
Thank you.

15:19.904 --> 15:22.196
- Well, if you want
to take it that way.

15:22.197 --> 15:23.407
- Whatever.
It's better than...

15:23.407 --> 15:24.658
people calling me sweetie

15:24.659 --> 15:27.118
and asking me
how I'm holding up.

15:27.119 --> 15:28.370
- I mean, I think that people
just want

15:28.370 --> 15:29.621
to know that you're okay,

15:29.622 --> 15:31.372
and they know this is
a weird birthday for you.

15:31.373 --> 15:34.208
- Well, the good news
is that I'm okay.

15:35.836 --> 15:39.046
So, yeah.
And we have a million snacks,

15:39.047 --> 15:42.633
so, uh, get yourself
something to eat.

15:42.634 --> 15:43.677
- Okay.

15:43.678 --> 15:45.178
- Have some.
Treat yourself.

15:45.179 --> 15:46.430
- Yeah, okay.
- Cool.

15:46.431 --> 15:48.222
I'll-m gonna talk...
I'm gonna go say hi to...

15:48.223 --> 15:49.974
I mean, I'll see you later.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.648
Hey.

15:56.649 --> 15:58.691
- I don't believe
exercise can be fun.

15:58.692 --> 15:59.818
- I didn't either,

15:59.819 --> 16:01.694
but then
I started choreographing

16:01.695 --> 16:03.446
these silly dances

16:03.447 --> 16:05.823
to these songs I liked
in seventh grade,

16:05.824 --> 16:08.076
and I realized
it can be almost fun.

16:08.077 --> 16:09.786
- Well, what about the pain?

16:09.787 --> 16:12.497
- Okay, in my dance class,
we pose through the pain.

16:14.583 --> 16:16.501
- Uh, you're laughing,
but I'm serious.

16:16.502 --> 16:17.711
It works.
- Okay.

16:17.712 --> 16:19.545
I'll give it a go.
- Yes!

16:21.173 --> 16:23.257
- Hey, guys.

16:31.892 --> 16:33.976
Oh, damn it.

16:33.977 --> 16:35.728
- Hey, Amy.

16:35.729 --> 16:39.482
What's going on?
- Um...

16:39.483 --> 16:41.025
Jules has been sober
for four months.

16:41.026 --> 16:42.236
We're trying to make it
to five.

16:42.237 --> 16:43.736
- Oh, okay.
Uh...

16:43.737 --> 16:46.239
I'll help out.
- No, I got this, really.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.825
- No.
- It's fine.

16:48.826 --> 16:50.284
- Uh, look.

16:50.285 --> 16:51.453
Found one.

16:51.454 --> 16:52.829
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

16:59.002 --> 17:02.004
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, Jules!

17:02.005 --> 17:04.424
- Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in months.

17:04.425 --> 17:05.592
Top you up?

17:05.593 --> 17:07.552
- No, thanks.
- Boo.

17:07.553 --> 17:10.263
- Come on.
- I'm actually sober now.

17:10.264 --> 17:12.515
So that's where I've been.

17:12.516 --> 17:15.226
Um, but you guys enjoy.

17:15.227 --> 17:17.645
- That's... that's great.
- Good for you.

17:17.646 --> 17:19.188
- Yeah.
- Really great.

17:19.189 --> 17:21.482
- Thanks.
- Jules, there you are.

17:21.483 --> 17:24.569
Sorry, can I steal this one
for one quick sec?

17:24.570 --> 17:26.612
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Uh, bye.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.781
- Want me to narc on them
to your mom?

17:27.781 --> 17:28.866
'Cause I will.

17:28.867 --> 17:30.742
- Snitches get stitches.

17:30.743 --> 17:33.286
- I will deal with a wound
that requires stitches

17:33.287 --> 17:34.455
for you, my dear.

17:36.206 --> 17:38.750
Stop worrying.
I am so good right now.

17:38.751 --> 17:41.210
I promise.
You know, parties are...

17:41.211 --> 17:42.421
fun sober.

17:42.422 --> 17:44.172
People's jokes
are still funny.

17:44.173 --> 17:45.882
Who knew?

17:48.969 --> 17:50.887
- Look, there's Leigh.
You should give her your gift.

17:52.598 --> 17:54.432
Sure you're okay?
- Yes.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.225
I'm great.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.654
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:08.655 --> 18:12.575
- A gift card!
- No, it's a sweater.

18:15.037 --> 18:16.621
Aww.
- There's more.

18:21.627 --> 18:25.129
- "Dear Leigh, my advice to you
in this time of crisis

18:25.130 --> 18:27.757
"is to go easy on your
very handsome friend Drew,

18:27.758 --> 18:29.550
"who loves you

18:29.551 --> 18:31.469
"and only wants
the best for you.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.888
P.S., hot outfit."
Thank you.

18:33.889 --> 18:36.974
"P.P.S., please stop
trolling me.

18:36.975 --> 18:41.854
XO, Millie."

18:41.855 --> 18:43.523
For the record,
I'm not a troll.

18:43.524 --> 18:46.192
That was just meant to be

18:46.193 --> 18:49.445
an inside joke
with myself...

18:49.446 --> 18:50.656
And then I

18:50.656 --> 18:51.782
accidentally hit Send.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.950
- Well, that's what you get
for having

18:52.950 --> 18:54.159
inside jokes with yourself

18:54.160 --> 18:55.785
and not including me.

18:55.786 --> 18:56.829
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.830
- It will never happen again.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.500
- Where's Ryan?

19:02.501 --> 19:04.585
- Oh, he was tired
after work,

19:04.586 --> 19:06.879
but, uh, he did say
happy birthday.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.217
- Did you...

19:11.218 --> 19:14.887
You told him about what I said
about him and that chef.

19:14.888 --> 19:18.224
- I was upset...
and he got it out of me.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.934
- Right, and now he hates me.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.727
- Me being honest
with my fiancé

19:21.728 --> 19:23.312
wasn't, like,
a personal attack

19:23.313 --> 19:25.189
against you.
- I just don't understand

19:25.190 --> 19:26.691
why you couldn't have kept that
between us.

19:26.692 --> 19:29.026
- Because he's my person,
and I tell him everything.

19:29.027 --> 19:30.361
That's how being married
to someone works.

19:30.362 --> 19:32.780
- I know how being married
to someone works.

19:37.035 --> 19:38.369
- I feel like every time
we see each other now,

19:38.370 --> 19:40.204
we fight.

19:40.205 --> 19:44.000
- I'm not trying to fight
with you.

19:44.001 --> 19:45.460
- I know.

19:48.714 --> 19:50.548
Okay, look, um,

19:50.549 --> 19:51.966
this is supposed to be a party,

19:51.967 --> 19:53.593
so let's just, like,
try to have fun,

19:53.594 --> 19:55.261
'cause that's the point
of this whole thing.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.054
Anyway.

19:57.055 --> 19:58.431
Why don't you go get yourself
a soda?

19:58.432 --> 19:59.807
Maybe you think
you're mad at me,

19:59.808 --> 20:02.351
and really,
it's just low blood sugar?

20:03.520 --> 20:04.813
- That's it.
- That's it.

20:04.814 --> 20:06.898
- Soda.

20:20.370 --> 20:21.663
- Recycling?

20:21.664 --> 20:24.373
- Um, empty them out first.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.711
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

20:28.712 --> 20:33.674
Oh, this Syrah
is too good to dump.

20:33.675 --> 20:34.968
- You're a wine guy?

20:34.969 --> 20:37.428
- I'm studying to be
a sommelier.

20:37.429 --> 20:39.430
- Really?

20:39.431 --> 20:43.017
- Wine is bottled poetry.

20:43.018 --> 20:45.895
- Yeah, I forget...
who said that,

20:45.896 --> 20:47.396
but it... it's true.

20:50.776 --> 20:53.444
Uh...
- Uh...

20:53.445 --> 20:54.821
- You're not the alcoholic.

20:54.822 --> 20:57.448
- No, I'm... I'm the mom.

20:57.449 --> 21:01.619
I have to make sure this party
doesn't go off the rails.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.163
- Everyone's fine.

21:04.164 --> 21:05.873
Party doesn't need a mom.

21:12.965 --> 21:14.549
- Yeah.

21:16.385 --> 21:17.969
- Cheers, universe.

21:21.223 --> 21:23.099
Right?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.268
Am I supposed to be tasting,

21:25.269 --> 21:28.896
um, blackberry
and vanilla?

21:28.897 --> 21:31.816
- Walnuts and smoke, yeah.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.282
- You probably don't know this,

21:39.283 --> 21:41.868
but I always had
a crush on you.

21:41.869 --> 21:45.913
- No, I knew.
We all knew.

21:45.914 --> 21:47.582
- Uh... uh, yeah.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.333
Just being alone with you

21:49.334 --> 21:50.335
in a dark corner

21:50.336 --> 21:52.420
was basically
my high school fantasy.

21:52.421 --> 21:53.755
Yeah.

21:57.551 --> 22:00.803
- What else happens
in your fantasy?

22:05.934 --> 22:07.518
- Hey.

22:07.519 --> 22:09.061
Frankie, hi.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.063
- Hey.
- Is, uh...

22:10.063 --> 22:11.064
is now an okay time

22:11.065 --> 22:13.649
to give you your present?

22:13.650 --> 22:15.109
- Yeah.

22:15.110 --> 22:16.736
- Do you remember,

22:16.737 --> 22:18.529
we made these

22:18.530 --> 22:19.947
for the cover
of our binders

22:19.948 --> 22:22.408
the night before
we started the seventh grade?

22:25.245 --> 22:27.830
You okay?

22:27.831 --> 22:30.583
- I don't know.

22:32.252 --> 22:34.837
- Look, I-I don't, um...

22:34.838 --> 22:36.672
I didn't want this
to be weird.

22:36.673 --> 22:38.049
I just... I...

22:38.050 --> 22:40.134
I missed you so much.

22:42.387 --> 22:45.473
Um, Leigh, I'm sorry
I didn't go

22:45.474 --> 22:47.809
to Matt's funeral.

22:47.810 --> 22:49.227
Yeah, I just... I told myself

22:49.228 --> 22:51.979
that you had this
huge support system

22:51.980 --> 22:53.314
and you wouldn't even notice
I was there.

22:53.315 --> 22:55.274
- What are you doing?

22:55.275 --> 22:56.943
- I'm... I'm just trying to, um...

22:56.944 --> 22:59.153
- Why are you bringing up
my husband's funeral

22:59.154 --> 23:01.322
at my birthday party?

23:01.323 --> 23:03.491
- Because I feel terrible
about not being there.

23:03.492 --> 23:06.035
You just... can you tell me

23:06.036 --> 23:07.745
what I need to do
to make it up to you.

23:07.746 --> 23:08.997
I promise...
- I don't know

23:08.998 --> 23:10.540
what you should do.
I'm s...

23:10.541 --> 23:12.750
you abandoned me.

23:12.751 --> 23:14.877
That was your choice.

23:14.878 --> 23:17.255
And every day
for the last four months,

23:17.256 --> 23:21.509
you chose not to call
or text,

23:21.510 --> 23:22.678
and now... I don't know
what you want to...

23:22.679 --> 23:24.971
you want us to pretend
like none of that happened?

23:24.972 --> 23:26.265
I just can't do that.
- No, I'm not...

23:26.266 --> 23:27.682
I'm not pretending.

23:27.683 --> 23:29.559
I'm sorry.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.769
S-funerals are really hard
for me.

23:31.770 --> 23:33.646
- Funerals are hard
for everyone.

23:37.568 --> 23:39.527
- Yeah, I was an idiot
for coming.

23:39.528 --> 23:42.864
- No, you're not an idiot.
I told you to come.

23:42.865 --> 23:46.451
I just wanted everything
to be okay,

23:46.452 --> 23:47.994
but it's...

23:47.995 --> 23:49.829
it's...

23:49.830 --> 23:52.373
not.

23:52.374 --> 23:55.126
I... I'm not ready
to forgive you.

23:55.127 --> 24:01.424
- ♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪

24:01.425 --> 24:03.092
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

24:03.093 --> 24:08.210

24:08.211 --> 24:09.503

24:09.504 --> 24:13.311
- Whoo.
- ♪ Happy birthday ♪

24:13.312 --> 24:17.064

24:20.152 --> 24:22.862
- Oh, I've seen her blow out
every other birthday candle.

24:22.863 --> 24:25.907
- Okay.
- Mm, mm.

24:25.908 --> 24:29.118
And many more!

24:35.417 --> 24:36.794
- Yeah!

24:38.837 --> 24:40.630
- Thanks.

24:40.631 --> 24:42.006
Oh, cool!

24:42.007 --> 24:44.008
Let me clean this mess up
so you guys can eat.

24:45.719 --> 24:47.386
- Whoo!
- Thanks.

24:47.387 --> 24:48.472
- Okay.
- Hi.

24:48.473 --> 24:50.098
- Hi.

24:50.099 --> 24:51.516
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:51.517 --> 24:52.851
Hey.

24:56.688 --> 24:58.439
- You guys want cake?
- Yes!

24:58.440 --> 24:59.857
- Hey, Jules,
remember that time

24:59.858 --> 25:01.776
we looked for
a 24-hour Ralph's forever

25:01.777 --> 25:03.403
because you said
you wanted frosting?

25:03.404 --> 25:06.030
- Oh, you downed
that Big Gulp of vodka,

25:06.031 --> 25:07.324
so you had to pee
really bad,

25:07.325 --> 25:09.158
but they wouldn't let you
use the bathroom at Ralph's,

25:09.159 --> 25:11.285
so you ended up peeing
off the side of an overpass

25:11.286 --> 25:12.787
and you hit a passing car.

25:12.788 --> 25:14.414
- It was amazing.

25:14.415 --> 25:16.833
I don't remember that.

25:16.834 --> 25:18.043
- It's one of
your best stories.

25:18.044 --> 25:20.670
- How can you
not remember that?

25:20.671 --> 25:22.630
- Um, I'm gonna
go get something.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.386
- Hey.

25:28.387 --> 25:30.430
- Hi.

25:30.431 --> 25:31.432
- What's going on?

25:31.433 --> 25:32.974
- Uh, I don't know.

25:32.975 --> 25:36.185
I think throwing a party
was a really bad idea.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.812
- Well, I'm having fun.

25:37.813 --> 25:41.566
- That's good.

25:41.567 --> 25:44.360
- Um...

25:44.361 --> 25:45.903
I have to ask you something,

25:45.904 --> 25:46.947
and I don't know
how to do it.

25:49.032 --> 25:51.200
- Okay.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.660
Just ask.

25:55.289 --> 25:57.290
- Do you think
Matt jumped off that cliff?

25:57.291 --> 25:58.542
- What?

26:00.461 --> 26:01.961
No, no.

26:01.962 --> 26:04.172
No, that'd be... that'd be crazy.

26:04.173 --> 26:05.299
- Really?

26:05.299 --> 26:06.467
You don't think it's crazier

26:06.467 --> 26:07.760
that he did that hike
50 times

26:07.761 --> 26:10.511
and that was the one time
he fell?

26:10.512 --> 26:12.096
Really?

26:12.097 --> 26:14.390
- Did you actually invite me
to your birthday party

26:14.391 --> 26:16.267
so you could harass me
about my brother's death?

26:16.268 --> 26:18.060
- How about the fact that he
was clinically depressed,

26:18.061 --> 26:19.062
and he died in an accident

26:19.063 --> 26:21.063
that could've easily
been intentional?

26:23.108 --> 26:25.610
- You know what?
I don't have to do this.

26:25.611 --> 26:27.195
- Are you just not going
to answer me?

26:27.196 --> 26:28.363
- I don't know what you want me
to say.

26:28.364 --> 26:29.739
- I want you to tell me
if you think he jumped.

26:29.740 --> 26:30.991
- Maybe!

26:37.873 --> 26:39.499
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

26:42.127 --> 26:43.503
But maybe.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.762
Okay.

26:52.763 --> 26:55.515
I'm leaving.

26:55.516 --> 26:57.058
Happy birthday.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.744
- Amy, what is it?

27:16.745 --> 27:18.454
- I just made out
with The Schwab.

27:18.455 --> 27:20.623
What?

27:20.624 --> 27:22.125
No, what?
- I did.

27:24.002 --> 27:25.795
- What's going on?

27:25.796 --> 27:27.922
- Nothing.

27:27.923 --> 27:29.091
- She made out with The Schwab.

27:29.091 --> 27:30.134
- No, shush!

27:30.135 --> 27:32.260
- I'm sorry!
It was just too good.

27:36.890 --> 27:38.641
- And I just feel like

27:38.642 --> 27:39.643
when I was drinking,

27:39.643 --> 27:40.811
I never had to worry

27:40.812 --> 27:42.228
about falling short,

27:42.229 --> 27:43.522
because it was easy to think

27:43.523 --> 27:46.149
that it was just the alcohol
making me fail.

27:46.150 --> 27:47.984
It was easy to think
that if I got sober,

27:47.985 --> 27:50.778
I would... do amazing.

27:50.779 --> 27:53.990
I just feel like I'm failing
at everything right now.

27:53.991 --> 27:55.200
Like this thing happened
at work.

27:55.201 --> 27:57.410
I had a project
I worked my ass off on

27:57.411 --> 27:59.787
but my boss hates it.

27:59.788 --> 28:00.789
I don't know.

28:00.790 --> 28:03.584
It just has not been
a great week.

29:00.641 --> 29:04.268
- I'm supposed to make
a moral inventory.

29:04.269 --> 29:05.270
Every lie, every mistake,
every insecurity.

29:05.271 --> 29:08.981
- That sounds like
literal hell.

29:08.982 --> 29:12.360
- Which is why I'm watching
"Real Housewives" instead.

29:12.361 --> 29:12.362
- Every sober day is a miracle.

29:12.362 --> 29:17.407
- Are you a friend of Bill's?

29:17.408 --> 29:18.700
- Friend of Jason.

29:18.701 --> 29:20.660
- Matt never wanted to talk
about his childhood.

29:20.661 --> 29:23.162
- People who want to talk about
their childhoods are weird.

29:23.163 --> 29:24.831
- Whatever.
I'll just ask your mom.

29:24.832 --> 29:26.332
- Don't... don't ask my mom
about that.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.793
Leave my mother out of it.

29:30.796 --> 29:32.673
- Hi.
- Hi.
