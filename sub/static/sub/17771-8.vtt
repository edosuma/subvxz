WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.625
Previously on Mech X4...

00:04.709 --> 00:06.166
I thought you were working
on the X-weapon.

00:06.250 --> 00:10.500
I am. Plus, I designed an app
that scans newsfeeds for monsters.

00:10.583 --> 00:13.875
(Principal Grey)
The robot has pilots. Human pilots!

00:13.959 --> 00:15.542
Get the primorphus core back.

00:15.625 --> 00:16.959
And something even better.

00:17.959 --> 00:19.458
Ryan Walker.

00:19.542 --> 00:20.583
I found Mech X4.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.375
(Mastermind)
Bring the robot to me.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.959
(Principal Grey)
How is Ryan dangerous?

00:24.041 --> 00:25.500
(Ryan)
You'll find out.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.375
(Ryan)
The bad guy is Principal Grey?

00:27.458 --> 00:30.375
Ryan. We were just talking
about you.

00:30.458 --> 00:33.083
The Leader plans to devastate
this entire planet.

00:33.166 --> 00:37.542
Now that he's... turned on me,
I need you to help me stop him.

00:42.291 --> 00:43.792
Harris!

00:43.875 --> 00:46.375
Your stupid X-weapon almost
burned my eyebrows off.

00:46.417 --> 00:49.959
You think I wanna look permanently
surprised for the rest of my life?

00:50.041 --> 00:52.500
I didn't know it would
overload your console.

00:52.583 --> 00:56.000
But now I do!
So... yay?

00:56.083 --> 00:57.166
Pfft.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.125
Everyone stay calm.

01:10.166 --> 01:11.250
Huh.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.959
(theme music playing)

01:33.709 --> 01:35.709
Everyone stay calm.

01:41.458 --> 01:42.834
(Ryan)
No, Mark, wait!

01:42.917 --> 01:44.500
Hm.

01:44.583 --> 01:45.792
Hah!

01:45.875 --> 01:46.834
Dang.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.667
Harris, you're all ideas,
why aren't you doing something?

01:50.750 --> 01:53.375
Was I the only one who heard
Ryan say "Stay calm"?

01:53.458 --> 01:54.750
All right, Dingus.

01:54.834 --> 01:57.250
Wanna explain why you brought
our enemy here?

01:57.333 --> 01:59.208
Because we have a much
bigger problem.

01:59.291 --> 02:01.709
The mastermind behind
the monsters.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.750
She's gonna help us stop 'em.

02:03.834 --> 02:05.375
You don't expect us
to trust her.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.834
We have to.

02:06.917 --> 02:08.875
The leader isn't what you think.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.208
He's actually trying
to save the planet

02:10.291 --> 02:11.792
from Earth's greatest threat.

02:11.875 --> 02:12.875
Owls.

02:12.959 --> 02:15.125
No. No, rats.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.709
No! Owls!

02:18.041 --> 02:19.083
Human beings?

02:19.166 --> 02:20.458
Exactly.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.333
We pollute. We build bombs.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.917
We stampede each other
over Christmas sales.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.959
Humanity has peaked.

02:27.041 --> 02:31.875
So when the Leader clears away
the unworthy, this place will be paradise

02:31.959 --> 02:33.875
for those he believes
deserve to survive.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.417
That's why he keeps
sending monsters.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.583
That's why
we have to stop him.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.125
Doesn't mean we're gonna
team up with you.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.417
You tried to kill us.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.166
For once, we have
the upper hand.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.250
He has no clue
that we're working together.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.166
Just imagine if we could
take down her boss?

02:48.250 --> 02:49.583
No more monsters.

02:49.667 --> 02:50.667
I don't know, Ry.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.625
I'll erase all
your detentions.

02:52.709 --> 02:53.875
Welcome to the team.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.667
Okay then, how do we
find your boss?

02:57.750 --> 03:00.333
There's... the wrinkle.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.625
I actually don't know
who he is.

03:02.709 --> 03:03.834
(snorts)

03:03.917 --> 03:07.834
You know... I have an idea
of how to flush him out.

03:07.917 --> 03:10.750
Flush. (laughs)

03:10.834 --> 03:12.792
Yeah. This is the team
that's beating you.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.166
(laughing)

03:14.250 --> 03:15.750
How do you live
with yourself?

03:18.625 --> 03:19.667
Sir, I can still be useful.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.417
You can meet me here
after school.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.500
I will not fail you
again, sir.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.917
Nice performance.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.208
Yeah, how does it feel
to be the bait?

03:33.291 --> 03:34.625
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

03:34.709 --> 03:37.709
How do I say this
politely? Yes.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.166
So now what?

03:39.250 --> 03:43.000
Now we wait. And hope
he wants you gone as bad as I do.

03:46.542 --> 03:49.125
Aah!
Could you watch it? Morris?

03:49.208 --> 03:51.583
-I... I'm sorry, ma'am.
-(Student) Check out Principal Grey.

03:51.667 --> 03:54.083
(exhales, clears throat)

03:54.166 --> 03:56.417
No, it's... my fault.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.166
Mm... mm.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.709
Commander Fly-Ry to Junior Einstein,
do you read me?

04:04.792 --> 04:06.834
I am not answering
to that code name.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.458
Use the one that I chose.

04:08.542 --> 04:11.709
All right. Well, there's still
no sign of the big bad.

04:11.792 --> 04:14.208
(sighs)
Swag Mc-Lady-Killer.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.709
Ahhh, that's right.

04:16.792 --> 04:18.750
Okay, nothing
on this end, either.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.208
Hey!

04:21.291 --> 04:23.792
So you did that crazy stunt
at the skate off, right?

04:23.875 --> 04:26.750
Yeah, that was my...
I mea... mean... heh!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.041
Ryan Walker, half pipe hero.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.709
So you've seen my work?

04:30.792 --> 04:31.625
Just saw it online.

04:31.709 --> 04:33.291
-Ah, Ryan.
-Hm?

04:33.375 --> 04:35.750
Uh, the school nurse
wanted me to tell you

04:35.834 --> 04:38.875
the amount of bacne
you're experiencing

04:38.959 --> 04:41.250
is abnormal.
It's highly contagious.

04:41.333 --> 04:44.583
See a doctor
and avoid netted shirts.

04:46.834 --> 04:49.333
I liked it better
when you sent monsters.

04:49.417 --> 04:51.875
Don't get distracted.
This is my life on the line!

04:53.083 --> 04:54.750
(sighs)

04:54.834 --> 04:56.625
(inhaling loudly)

04:56.709 --> 04:58.834
-(banging into locker)
-Where the heck have you been?

04:58.917 --> 05:00.709
Being the responsible
one for once.

05:00.792 --> 05:06.625
(laughing)
Tell it again, please.

05:06.709 --> 05:09.959
Okay. My school principal
is part of a conspiracy

05:10.041 --> 05:11.625
to kill every human
on Earth.

05:11.709 --> 05:15.166
(laughing)

05:15.250 --> 05:18.458
Aren't you the kid that filled his
math teacher's minivan with egg salad,

05:18.542 --> 05:20.041
and then blamed it on aliens?

05:21.834 --> 05:22.917
It did not go well.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.291
(machine whirring)

05:36.583 --> 05:37.792
Morris?

05:47.625 --> 05:48.875
What are you doing here
so late?

05:48.959 --> 05:50.041
(machine turns off)

05:50.125 --> 05:52.458
I just figured it would be better
to take you down

05:52.542 --> 05:54.417
without a bunch of kids around.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.166
What did you just say?

06:02.875 --> 06:05.417
(rising tone)

06:06.875 --> 06:07.959
(gasps)

06:09.750 --> 06:13.542
Did you really think you were the only
agent the Leader had stationed here?

06:23.542 --> 06:24.792
(buzzing)

06:27.083 --> 06:28.750
(shouts)

06:28.834 --> 06:29.875
-Ooh!
-(grunts)

06:34.458 --> 06:35.834
Get after her!

06:39.458 --> 06:41.583
(breathing heavily)

06:42.834 --> 06:47.417
Oh, no. I'm cornered
and I'm helpless...

06:47.500 --> 06:49.917
is what you expected me to say.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.834
Let's take 'em down.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.333
(shouts)

07:09.250 --> 07:10.709
See ya!

07:10.792 --> 07:12.542
(grunting)

07:17.375 --> 07:18.417
Huh?

07:30.291 --> 07:32.583
Bounce belt, losers.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.291
All right. Come play me, bro.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.792
(groans)

07:49.875 --> 07:51.375
You all saw that, right?

07:51.458 --> 07:53.792
Totally makes up for getting beaten up
by the principal?

07:56.709 --> 07:57.709
Ahh!

08:03.792 --> 08:04.875
(indistinct shouts)

08:13.583 --> 08:15.709
(beam buzzing)

08:15.792 --> 08:17.750
Ahh... ahh!

08:18.750 --> 08:20.667
Goodbye, kid.

08:22.625 --> 08:23.792
(groans)

08:25.041 --> 08:26.750
(growling)

08:30.000 --> 08:31.291
(gasps, groans)

08:34.709 --> 08:36.792
(growls)

08:40.834 --> 08:41.750
Ow!

08:43.750 --> 08:45.542
What the...?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.375
Ooh! Ugh!

08:50.625 --> 08:54.500
-Where is he, Morris? Where is the Leader?
-Hey, no killing.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.959
-Stop trying to be a hero.
-I said no!

08:59.750 --> 09:00.792
(grunts)

09:00.875 --> 09:01.917
(groans)

09:03.375 --> 09:06.291
Um, thanks... for saving me.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.750
(soldiers chattering)

09:09.834 --> 09:13.250
-Yeah. Yeah, you better run!
-(Soldier) Hurry up! Come on, move it!

09:13.333 --> 09:14.750
Yeah, don't mess with Harris!

09:17.166 --> 09:18.625
Maybe you're not so bad.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.750
Maybe not.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.375
(sirens)

09:22.458 --> 09:24.291
Ballin'!

09:24.375 --> 09:25.750
Oh, I'm keepin' this.

09:25.834 --> 09:26.792
The others just bounced.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.834
Ryan we gotta go, too.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.834
The cops are coming.

09:30.917 --> 09:34.041
It's cool. I got what I needed.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.917
Whoa-whoa!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.500
Oh, now you're moving in.

09:40.583 --> 09:45.250
'Kay, fair warning, when no ones'
on the X-Deck, I tend to go commando.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.709
New rule. No, you don't.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.792
These are just a few things
from my office.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.709
My principal cover is useless now.

09:53.417 --> 09:54.542
Is this me?

09:54.625 --> 09:57.750
Yeah. I was surveilling you
back when I was trying to...

09:59.208 --> 10:00.375
you know...

10:00.458 --> 10:01.750
Oh. (gasps)

10:01.834 --> 10:03.291
Mr. Wooby!

10:03.375 --> 10:05.542
Oh, I... also broke
into your house to look around.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.458
Whoa, whoa, you were
in our house?

10:07.542 --> 10:10.458
Yeah, no one could hear me
above your snoring.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.125
Mark Walker doesn't snore.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.875
Mmm...

10:13.959 --> 10:17.792
How is stealing a cherished toy
gathering intel?

10:17.875 --> 10:20.208
-It's not. You're too old for a Wooby.
-Oh.

10:20.291 --> 10:24.458
Even if that thing has the boss' location,
it will be encrypted.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.083
I'm pretty handy
at crackin' this stuff.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.834
Thank you.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.583
You're just...
entering random codes?

10:31.709 --> 10:33.583
-This could take forev...
-Got it!

10:33.667 --> 10:35.291
er.

10:35.375 --> 10:37.458
All right, so there's nothing
in the GPS.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.834
But he only used it
to call one number.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.250
This could be the boss.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.583
Call him. I have an app
that can trace the call

10:43.667 --> 10:45.291
if you can keep him
on the line long enough.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.250
Okay.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.625
(phone ringing) (Mastermind voice)
Report.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.417
(deep voice)
Uhh... Hey. It's Morris.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.792
(Mastermind voice)
Is Grey gone?

10:55.875 --> 10:57.792
Uh... yeah.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.542
And, um, we also ran into the pilot,
and we took him out, too.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.000
But it was really hard, though.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.834
(Mastermind voice)
Why? What was the problem?

11:04.917 --> 11:07.542
Because he's like really strong,
stronger than I thought.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.083
And he's really cool.
Cooler than his lame brother.

11:11.166 --> 11:13.166
Uh, if he has a brother.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.750
(Mastermind voice)
That's irrelevant.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.125
But very thorough.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.250
Um... I love you, bye.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.959
I love you, bye?

11:24.083 --> 11:26.667
Dang it, I always say that
when I'm nervous.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.041
Amazingly, that worked.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.166
We got his location.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.291
What are we waiting for?

11:35.834 --> 11:40.709
(stomping footsteps)

11:51.291 --> 11:52.709
(Harris)
There's someone in there.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.208
With some pretty impressive tech
for an abandoned building.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.750
Yeah, jackpot!

11:57.834 --> 12:00.667
(Mastermind)
You've made a terrible mistake.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.625
(roaring)

12:18.875 --> 12:20.750
What?

12:20.834 --> 12:24.917
(power turning off)

12:28.417 --> 12:30.417
The main power core's down!

12:34.000 --> 12:35.417
-Ryan!
-Ah!

12:38.750 --> 12:40.750
(growling)

12:40.834 --> 12:43.625
He's making a better world.
And, once I provide him

12:43.709 --> 12:46.250
with the kid who can
control machines with his mind,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.959
I will get my place back in it.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.458
(roaring)

13:06.291 --> 13:07.667
Aah!
(grunts)

13:07.750 --> 13:10.875
I've crippled the robot
for you and brought you the crew.

13:10.959 --> 13:12.667
(Principal Grey)
But there is more.

13:12.750 --> 13:17.500
The pilot has a power. He can
control machines with his mind.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.750
That's how he's been
controlling the robot.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.166
(Mastermind)
I'm... intrigued.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.250
-How did you know I had powers?
-Please.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.917
The exploding glove?
You cracking that phone?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.417
Wasn't hard for me to figure out
that's how you defeated me at the lab.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.458
I thought the machines
were just going haywire,

13:32.542 --> 13:33.583
but it was you.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.959
Wait... wait, that was you at Harpers!

13:36.041 --> 13:37.125
You said it was a dude.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.333
-Well...
-And he was six feet tall.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.375
-(sheepish noise)
-And had legs like tree trunks.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.291
-He wasn't wrong about that, I mean...
-Quiet!

13:44.375 --> 13:46.250
Can you honestly tell me

13:46.333 --> 13:48.375
you don't want to know
how his power works?

13:48.458 --> 13:50.959
(Mastermind)
Bring him to me and all is forgiven.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.125
I knew his curiosity about your power
would buy me back in.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.166
Now! Let's go.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.417
Yeah, I don't think so.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.250
Hah!

14:09.792 --> 14:10.792
(laughs)

14:12.917 --> 14:14.875
(groaning)

14:16.166 --> 14:18.291
I always wondered what a
burning principal smelled like.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.083
Harris, can we please
get the power back?

14:21.166 --> 14:22.125
Bam!

14:22.208 --> 14:23.333
(Principal Grey)
What?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.709
I sabotaged the main battery!

14:30.792 --> 14:33.125
-You mean with this?
-You really think I'd let you

14:33.208 --> 14:35.750
smuggle a piece of tech
onto my robot?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.834
I scanned you with my power
every five minutes.

14:37.917 --> 14:40.542
Why would you pretend
that it worked?

14:40.625 --> 14:42.333
Because we totally wanted
to see your face

14:42.417 --> 14:44.709
when we double-crossed
your double-cross.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.709
And texting photo...

14:47.792 --> 14:49.542
-Got it.
-Got it.

14:49.625 --> 14:52.208
-(phone chimes)
-And making it my wallpaper.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.333
Really, though, I hoped...
you... wouldn't go through with it.

14:55.417 --> 14:59.250
That maybe there was more to you
than just some... villain.

15:00.583 --> 15:01.917
Nope!

15:02.000 --> 15:05.750
(breathing heavily)
That monster will crush all of us!

15:07.417 --> 15:09.125
(growling)

15:10.959 --> 15:12.625
Harris, where are you
with the X-weapon?

15:12.709 --> 15:14.417
Good to go, son.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.500
-Ready!
-Ready.

15:26.583 --> 15:27.709
Ready!

15:38.667 --> 15:39.875
Mech...

15:41.125 --> 15:42.667
Execute!

15:42.750 --> 15:44.792
(roaring)

15:58.250 --> 16:00.000
(roaring)

16:00.083 --> 16:01.625
Aagh!

16:01.709 --> 16:03.792
Ryan? Shut it down!

16:03.875 --> 16:04.875
No, it's working!

16:05.959 --> 16:07.000
I can do this!

16:07.083 --> 16:08.083
Ryan!

16:08.166 --> 16:09.417
(shouting)

16:09.500 --> 16:10.792
(roaring)

16:20.792 --> 16:23.083
-Ryan!
-Hey, Ryan!

16:23.166 --> 16:24.792
Ugh! Everything hurts.

16:24.875 --> 16:25.917
Grey's gone.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.875
Come on. We have
to split up and find her.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.166
Let us find her.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.333
You rest.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.166
No, she threatened Mom.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.125
She threatened my friends.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.834
I'm gonna help bring her down.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.875
(Ryan)
You're not going anywhere.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.333
You really wanna go
head-to-head again?

16:49.417 --> 16:51.250
You can barely stand.

16:57.542 --> 16:58.625
Hi.

17:02.291 --> 17:03.709
(Principal Grey)
Surprise.

17:03.792 --> 17:04.917
(buzzing)

17:05.000 --> 17:06.083
(gasps)

17:13.875 --> 17:14.959
Ryan!

17:16.375 --> 17:17.375
Ooh!

17:40.750 --> 17:41.750
Yah!

17:44.875 --> 17:46.000
Hah!

17:46.083 --> 17:47.750
Ohh!

17:47.834 --> 17:50.041
Not the tie, not the tie!

17:52.291 --> 17:53.542
-Whoa!
-(grunting)

17:56.208 --> 17:57.959
God, I should've done
the Pilates!

18:01.750 --> 18:02.750
-Whoa!
-(grunting)

18:08.125 --> 18:09.083
Ah!

18:09.166 --> 18:10.542
(grunting)

18:14.375 --> 18:16.500
Ugh! (groans)

18:16.583 --> 18:17.792
Ryan!

18:17.875 --> 18:18.792
You okay?

18:20.917 --> 18:21.917
(gasps)

18:27.709 --> 18:29.166
Okay. (breathing deeply)

18:41.917 --> 18:43.291
I can't control it!

18:45.375 --> 18:46.458
Ooh!

18:46.542 --> 18:47.875
-Oh!
-Oh, go, go, go!

18:50.750 --> 18:53.375
I got you. Nobody dies.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.709
Not even you.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.709
It doesn't matter.
We're all dead anyway.

18:58.583 --> 18:59.750
He'll make sure of that.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.208
Can't hold on...

19:02.291 --> 19:03.458
No!

19:03.542 --> 19:05.458
(screaming)

19:07.834 --> 19:10.333
(splash, bubbling)

19:19.500 --> 19:20.959
I thought she could change.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.583
I thought I could save her.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.750
You tried, Ryan.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.959
But... who was she?

19:32.041 --> 19:35.875
Who was her boss?
I mean... did we even really win?

19:37.333 --> 19:38.709
We stopped her.

19:38.792 --> 19:40.041
We're alive.

19:41.375 --> 19:42.417
So, yeah.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.000
I think we won.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.000
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

20:01.500 --> 20:02.667
We earned some downtime.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.000
We took down the principal
and the big bad.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.709
Hey, we don't know that for sure.

20:06.792 --> 20:09.667
We couldn't find any trace
of them after the big battle.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.625
Well, I do that Donut King
is about to premiere a brand new flavor.

20:13.709 --> 20:16.542
A donut made up completely
of frosting.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.667
Whoa. I'll get the milk.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.750
Ugh. Okay, I'm really tired
from using the X-weapon,

20:23.834 --> 20:26.291
so, I think I'm just gonna
chill here for a bit.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.750
Okay.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.709
(exhales)

20:59.000 --> 21:00.709
I'm adopted?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.750
(theme music playing)
