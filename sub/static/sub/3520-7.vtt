WEBVTT

00:07.008 --> 00:09.594
Oh, God.

00:09.761 --> 00:11.638
Why did you guys let me
have tequila last night?

00:11.763 --> 00:13.556
You know it makes me
mean and scary.

00:13.682 --> 00:15.892
Actually, I'm really looking forward
to the drag queen re-enactment

00:16.017 --> 00:17.602
of your epic speech
at The Castro.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.312
Oh, God, no.

00:19.437 --> 00:21.898
You also called Richie's
boyfriend a Truvada whore.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.109
- You were a fucking mess, girl.
- Wait a second.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.610
Did I throw up
on a Hobbit last night?

00:25.777 --> 00:27.696
- Oh, my God. You mean Eddie?
- Yeah.

00:27.821 --> 00:30.115
I had to clean up all
the vomit from his hairy feet.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.825
- Oh, gross!
- I'm so sorry.

00:31.950 --> 00:34.327
Honestly, I did not mean to go off
on all of you last night like that.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.204
- Oh, really?
- Oh, he didn't mean it, Dom.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.956
- Dom, he didn't mean it.
- To make up for it, you guys,

00:38.081 --> 00:40.333
I smuggled in these scones
from Tartine.

00:40.458 --> 00:43.670
- Wow. That's a good start.
- Who do you keep texting?

00:43.795 --> 00:45.922
Oh. Oops. Malik.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.966
Don't be mad at me,
you should be happy.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.635
I've had 17 orgasms
in the last five days.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.637
And I've had the pleasure
of hearing, like, 15 of them.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.389
All right, I have to tell him
something really important.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.557
This is super-duper important.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.975
A very important document
I'm sending him

00:57.100 --> 00:58.560
for a very high-powered
meeting we're having.

00:58.685 --> 01:00.270
Okay, give it here.
No more texting.

01:00.395 --> 01:01.730
Your tits are blurry.

01:01.855 --> 01:04.858
I'm so fucking unbelievably
embarrassed. What am I gonna do?

01:04.983 --> 01:09.279
I'm gonna have to move back home
or leave the country or something.

01:09.904 --> 01:12.449
What'd he say?

01:13.658 --> 01:15.952
It's from your Aunt Sarah.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.332
- Oh, fuck.
- Is everything okay?

01:21.458 --> 01:24.502
My dad's dead.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.424
Oh, fuck.

01:33.970 --> 01:35.680
That's not my coffee.

01:37.015 --> 01:39.476
I never got my coffee.

01:48.109 --> 01:50.737
I so appreciate
you coming with me.

01:50.862 --> 01:52.906
Are you kidding?
Of course.

01:53.031 --> 01:54.449
He was like a dad to me.

01:54.574 --> 01:57.869
He loved you so much.

01:58.036 --> 02:00.455
My God, even after you
told him that you were gay,

02:00.580 --> 02:02.373
- he still wanted us to get married.
- I know.

02:02.499 --> 02:04.584
He even offered to pay
for the ring.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.419
- Oh, that's so...
- You didn't know that?

02:06.544 --> 02:10.590
He did, he did. God.

02:10.715 --> 02:12.967
Oh, he was like,
"You're her last hope."

02:16.137 --> 02:19.265
Malik asked me if he could come
and I told him no.

02:19.390 --> 02:23.228
- Am I a monster?
- No.

02:23.394 --> 02:25.563
I just feel like I didn't know what
I was gonna do with him in Modesto.

02:25.688 --> 02:29.150
We're gonna go on the tour of
the Frito-Lay factory or something?

02:29.275 --> 02:30.902
Oh, my God, can we please go there?
I love Frito Lays.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.112
What the fuck, Prius? Go around.

02:33.238 --> 02:35.990
Yeah, or, just
thinking out loud here,

02:36.115 --> 02:40.286
Dom, you could take the Volvo over,
I don't know, what, 50 maybe?

02:40.411 --> 02:41.996
You guys, thanks
so much for letting me come.

02:42.121 --> 02:43.289
I'm not sure what
it says about me

02:43.373 --> 02:44.582
that I'm going
to your dad's funeral

02:44.707 --> 02:46.042
who I never even met
when I should be at home

02:46.167 --> 02:47.919
dealing with my own shit.

02:48.044 --> 02:51.339
Well, I don't give a shit
why you came. I appreciate it.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.550
Don't hog the gummy worms,
please.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.928
So were you and your dad
close growing up?

02:57.095 --> 02:59.556
You don't have to talk about
this if you don't want to.

02:59.681 --> 03:01.432
What else are we
gonna talk about?

03:02.433 --> 03:04.602
He was a good dad.
You know, he...

03:04.769 --> 03:06.312
My main memory, actually,
I was just thinking,

03:06.437 --> 03:10.400
was how-- was driving around
in the middle of the night,

03:10.525 --> 03:12.443
eating Tastee-Freez,

03:12.610 --> 03:14.571
and waiting for my mom
to pass out.

03:14.696 --> 03:17.824
- She was a raging alcoholic.
- Oh, God, that's terrible.

03:17.949 --> 03:20.660
But go on, I'm always interested in
hearing about someone's childhood

03:20.785 --> 03:22.453
that was potentially
worse than mine.

03:22.579 --> 03:24.956
Well, then I have
a wonderful gift for you.

03:25.123 --> 03:27.500
She used to come into my room
in the middle of the night,

03:27.625 --> 03:29.919
drunk, and she would say,

03:30.044 --> 03:32.005
"And where were you?"

03:32.130 --> 03:35.008
And I'd say, "I was
driving around with Dad."

03:35.133 --> 03:37.385
And she'd say...

03:37.510 --> 03:39.512
"Up yours with a meat hook!"

03:39.637 --> 03:40.889
That's kind of charming.

03:41.014 --> 03:44.350
Oh, my God. Your childhood
was definitely worse than mine.

03:44.475 --> 03:48.146
It, you know,
it gave me a sense of humor,

03:48.313 --> 03:49.522
encouraged me
to go into nursing.

03:52.901 --> 03:57.614
Oh, God.
I can't believe we're back.

03:57.739 --> 04:02.327
It's like nothing's changed.
Just looks a little smaller.

04:02.452 --> 04:03.786
Is someone staying
at your dad's place?

04:03.870 --> 04:05.246
Is that why we're staying
at a hotel?

04:05.371 --> 04:07.999
No, I just didn't
really feel like I was...

04:08.166 --> 04:10.543
I was ready for all that yet.
You know?

04:10.668 --> 04:12.629
Plus, I've always wanted
to stay at this Clarion.

04:12.712 --> 04:13.838
- Really.
- Really?

04:14.047 --> 04:17.133
Yeah, growing up I used to think
the pool looked so rock star.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.844
We are swimming in that pool,
bitches. We're doing it.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.679
I will definitely go
swimming with you, Doris.

04:21.804 --> 04:24.223
Even though my legs are
painfully white at the moment.

04:24.349 --> 04:27.518
Should we check in before
we go to the funeral home?

04:27.685 --> 04:32.106
No, I want to see him.
I need to see him.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.567
Oh, God. Would you please
take these away from me?

04:34.692 --> 04:37.570
After I have one more,
and then take them away.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.530
And then when the nausea passes,
give them back to me.

04:39.656 --> 04:41.366
Okay.

04:46.496 --> 04:49.040
Before you go back there,
you need to know,

04:49.165 --> 04:54.212
he may not look exactly
the way you remember him.

04:57.382 --> 04:59.384
I don't want to see the body.
I really don't, actually.

04:59.509 --> 05:00.969
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to. All right?

05:01.052 --> 05:02.220
Okay, okay, okay...

05:02.303 --> 05:06.599
But I never went and saw my dad's,
and I always regretted it.

05:06.724 --> 05:09.602
Oh, my God, are you making me
feel guilty in a funeral home?

05:09.727 --> 05:12.230
Thank you,
that's very classy of you.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.443
Okay. Okay.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.862
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.172
Oh, my God.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.633
Oh, wow.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.011
Oh, my God.
He's gone.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.596
Oh, he's gone.

05:45.763 --> 05:49.809
I know.

05:49.934 --> 05:53.021
The only good thing about
a heart attack is it's quick.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.031
I hated that fucking suit.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.243
Aunt Sarah is too fucking cheap
to buy him a new one.

06:13.583 --> 06:16.586
Hey.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.755
Remember that time he...

06:18.880 --> 06:21.883
caught us making out in your
room listening to Wham!?

06:24.635 --> 06:27.930
He was like, "I'm gonna make
you kids some tuna fish sandwiches,

06:28.056 --> 06:31.601
so you go to it."

06:31.726 --> 06:33.853
Oh, my God,
he loved thumbs-up.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.980
Big fan of the thumbs-up.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.484
I should be honest with you
and tell you

06:39.650 --> 06:41.069
that sometimes
when we were making out,

06:41.152 --> 06:43.821
I used to think
about George Michael.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.657
Well, just so you know,
I did too.

06:53.623 --> 06:55.500
God!

06:56.292 --> 07:00.213
Oh, I hate how much makeup
they put on him. It's gross.

07:00.338 --> 07:02.799
Oh...

07:03.382 --> 07:05.218
He kinda looks
like a drag queen.

07:05.343 --> 07:06.844
No...

07:07.011 --> 07:08.304
I'm sorry.

07:11.641 --> 07:15.478
Oh, my God, I just spit.
I'm sorry.

07:20.525 --> 07:23.861
- Are you okay, Doris?
- Yes, I am, thank you.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.531
That was just
very fucking surreal.

07:28.199 --> 07:30.243
Do you want a neck rub?

07:30.368 --> 07:33.871
What? A neck rub?

07:33.996 --> 07:36.207
- I don't-- Why?
- I don't know.

07:36.332 --> 07:39.460
You look like you might need one,
and I give a good neck rub.

07:41.254 --> 07:44.674
Okay. Yes.
Yes, you know what? Yes.

07:44.799 --> 07:46.551
- I would like one, actually.
- There you go.

07:46.717 --> 07:50.721
- I do... Oh, God. Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah.

07:50.847 --> 07:53.516
I'm just so surprised
I didn't cry when I saw him.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.561
You're in the middle
of it right now. It's hard.

07:58.187 --> 08:01.232
- Can I get a hit of that?
- Of course.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.490
Do you mind
if we go for a drive?

08:09.615 --> 08:11.284
I wanna show
you guys something.

08:12.201 --> 08:15.037
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

08:15.163 --> 08:17.206
As long as you
keep doing that, yes.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.923
I can't believe my dad's dream
is now a donut shop.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.383
Oh, my God.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.178
I just saw my dad's dead body,
and this is more depressing.

08:30.303 --> 08:32.513
In high school, I came to a place
like this every afternoon,

08:32.638 --> 08:35.766
and sat in a booth, alone, with a box
of glazed, reading an <i>Out Magazine</i>

08:35.933 --> 08:37.810
tucked inside a
<i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

08:37.935 --> 08:40.563
Okay, your sad childhood
is totally catching up to mine.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.441
So close,
it's passing me the baton.

08:45.276 --> 08:48.070
- Hi, three black coffees, please.
- Hi.

08:48.196 --> 08:50.072
Three black coffees.
Anything else?

08:50.198 --> 08:53.159
Long John, cruller,
chicken sandwich?

08:53.743 --> 08:56.078
No, we're good, thanks.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.456
Did you know this used
to be a Portuguese diner?

08:59.290 --> 09:00.958
What's that?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.794
It's a diner where
they serve Portuguese food.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.005
Oh, that sounds
super exotic.

09:06.130 --> 09:09.800
Yeah. The food was really good,
but it didn't work out.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.678
It's a bad location.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.222
Hope it works out for you.

09:14.347 --> 09:15.890
Yeah, probably will.

09:16.015 --> 09:17.850
We won best apple fritter
in Modesto

09:17.975 --> 09:20.561
for ten years in a row, so...

09:21.729 --> 09:23.814
I'll get your coffees.

09:27.026 --> 09:29.278
I should have been
able to make it work.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.738
Oh, please,
it's not your fault.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.782
It was doomed
from the start, honestly.

09:32.907 --> 09:35.660
I mean, your dad kept track of the
books on napkins, for Christ's sake.

09:35.785 --> 09:37.870
Don't blame yourself.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.498
You know what I think would
make us feel a lot better?

09:40.665 --> 09:43.167
- What?
- Three of those apple fritters.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.044
Fuck it,
let's get a half dozen.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.170
- Paddy...
- I'm on it. Yep.

09:46.337 --> 09:47.922
- I'll be right back.
- Yes.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.340
- Did you see that?
- I did.

09:49.507 --> 09:52.301
That was sexy talk, there.
Half dozen.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.692
This pool is even better
than I remember it.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.527
What?

10:09.694 --> 10:11.362
- I have to pee a little bit.
- Okay.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.031
But out of respect
for Clarion Inns everywhere,

10:14.156 --> 10:16.033
- I'm going to be holding it.
- Amazing. Thank you.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.369
Oh, my God, I said that, and a
little tiny bit just came out.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.873
Disgusting.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.878
My father just died, okay?
Give me a break, please.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.714
What would you guys do around here
when you were growing up

10:29.797 --> 10:30.881
besides drugs?

10:31.048 --> 10:34.468
- God, what did we do?
- Good question. What did we do?

10:34.593 --> 10:36.178
We went to the mall.

10:36.304 --> 10:37.471
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, all the time.

10:37.555 --> 10:40.474
- And movies.
- Nice.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.394
We had sex.
Stuff like that.

10:43.561 --> 10:47.064
Okay. I think I need
to hear about the having sex.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.567
It was...
it was really good, actually.

10:49.734 --> 10:52.570
Oh, my God!
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:52.695 --> 10:54.947
- No, it was not.
- What?

10:55.072 --> 10:56.866
Why do I remember it
being so good?

10:56.991 --> 11:00.077
Yeah, maybe because you came
all the time. I didn't come.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.706
- That wasn't good for you?
- Oh, Jesus.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.083
You know that
I loved you so much.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.837
I loved you too.
I still do. I do.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.672
- Fuck you.
- I really do.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.215
I'm trying to be nice.

11:13.341 --> 11:16.010
I once lightly fingered
a girl in high school.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.095
But, I didn't really
know what I was doing,

11:18.262 --> 11:20.389
so I just put my finger in it.
I think she liked it, though.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.017
She did not like it, okay,
and I'm sure she has a very

11:23.142 --> 11:24.518
different memory
of that evening.

11:24.643 --> 11:28.105
Oh, my God, Dom,
if you make chicken this good,

11:28.230 --> 11:31.275
you'd be a huge success.
Now this is good chicken!

11:31.442 --> 11:32.735
Fuck you both.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.820
I just got a text from Malik.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.074
"Thinking of you."

11:38.199 --> 11:40.493
- Oh, man.
- That's so fucking sweet.

11:40.618 --> 11:44.330
- I really like him.
- Yeah. I do too.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.582
He's pretty fucking perfect.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.127
I cannot get enough
of that gorgeous black ass.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.963
Believe me.
It is too much.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.800
We should go out tonight.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.844
Do you want to visit anyone
in your family

11:58.969 --> 12:01.013
before we see them
at the funeral tomorrow?

12:01.305 --> 12:05.059
Fuck no, I want to
go do something fun.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.603
Is there any chance there's
a gay bar around here?

12:07.728 --> 12:09.647
Or at least a Pinkberry where
I can get some gay toppings?

12:09.772 --> 12:10.981
Basically anything gay.

12:11.107 --> 12:12.650
- I know a place.
- You do?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.110
- I do.
- Here?

12:19.824 --> 12:23.285
Best gay bar ever!

12:23.744 --> 12:25.621
Oh, my God,
there's your dancing friend.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.623
Oh, wow, totally.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.838
Maybe I should just move to
Modesto and become a bartender

12:33.963 --> 12:37.842
at the Brave Bull and start dating
Mr. Lonely down there.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.635
Oh, God, look at him.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.054
Getting drunk, probably snuck
out of his parents' house,

12:42.179 --> 12:45.141
wearing his sister's jeans,
thinking about killing himself,

12:45.266 --> 12:46.976
obsessively listening
to Evanescence.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.644
Wait, whose life
are we talking about?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.604
'Cause I don't think the kids are
listening to that these days.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.606
God, I was so fucking lonely
back then.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.733
Patrick, you're one
of my favorite people on Earth,

12:54.859 --> 12:58.028
but I have a funeral that I have
to go to in about 12 hours,

12:58.195 --> 13:00.364
and you're kind of bumming me out.
A little bit.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.574
Sorry. You're right.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.243
Could we get some drinks, please?
Some more drinks?

13:04.869 --> 13:07.329
Wait. We're running a special
on strawberry daiquiris,

13:07.455 --> 13:09.999
- 'cause we finally got a blender.
- Yay!

13:10.124 --> 13:12.668
- I think we'll have three Bud Lights.
- Okay. No problem.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.128
Suit yourself.

13:14.253 --> 13:17.131
Hey, do you need me to do anything
tomorrow, for the funeral?

13:17.256 --> 13:20.050
Oh, I'm sure my Aunt Sarah
has it all taken care of.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.804
You know, she was sexually
abused by my Uncle Bunny,

13:23.929 --> 13:28.100
so she's all fucked up, but she was
always a very good sister to my dad.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.935
Oh, my God.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.396
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

13:32.563 --> 13:35.608
- We are fucking dancing.
- So are you.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.276
Hey, you should ask your
new boyfriend to dance.

13:37.443 --> 13:39.111
You'll make his day.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.955
- There you are.
- Hey!

13:54.793 --> 13:56.504
By the way, if you're still here
at 10:00,

13:56.921 --> 13:59.381
Kitty Leukemia
is doing a Lady Gaga set.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.343
- I'm just saying, stick around.
- Cool.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.800
Everybody loved George.

14:42.967 --> 14:47.805
If my mother were alive, she'd say,
"Damn, my favorite child is gone."

14:48.847 --> 14:52.059
And more than
just being a great brother,

14:52.184 --> 14:54.645
he was an amazing father

14:54.770 --> 14:58.440
to Doris.
He loved her so much.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.653
I remember when she was born,
he looked at me and he said,

15:02.820 --> 15:06.782
"Wow. This makes
everything worthwhile."

15:06.907 --> 15:09.326
And from that moment on,
they were attached at the hip,

15:09.410 --> 15:10.661
they went everywhere together.

15:10.786 --> 15:15.749
And when he talked about her,
his whole face would light up.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.003
He was so proud when Doris
joined the swim team.

15:19.086 --> 15:22.256
He got up every morning at 5:00 a.m.
and took her to practice,

15:22.381 --> 15:24.883
and he never missed
one of her meets.

15:25.009 --> 15:27.678
He would scream so loudly
when she won,

15:27.803 --> 15:31.056
"That's the stuff, Big D,
that's the stuff!"

15:31.181 --> 15:33.851
And everybody
would look at him.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.979
Now, most kids would be embarrassed
by this, but Doris didn't care.

15:37.104 --> 15:41.567
She loved it. And every time
she'd finish a race,

15:41.692 --> 15:45.154
she'd lift her head
and find her dad

15:45.279 --> 15:47.281
in the crowd
with his thumbs-up.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.453
He was there for you then,

15:52.578 --> 15:55.122
he was there for you when you
moved away to San Francisco,

15:55.247 --> 16:00.461
and even though...
he won't be here now,

16:00.586 --> 16:05.549
I tell you, Big D, he is going
to always be with you in spirit.

16:07.092 --> 16:10.429
And now,
I would like to read a poem,

16:10.554 --> 16:15.309
<i>Clear Midnight</i>, by
my brother's favorite, Walt Whitman.

16:18.812 --> 16:23.651
<i>" This is thy hour O Soul,</i>

16:23.776 --> 16:28.238
<i>thy free flight into the wordless,</i>

16:28.364 --> 16:31.408
<i>away from books, away from art,</i>

16:31.533 --> 16:36.121
<i>the day erased,
the lesson done,</i>

16:38.332 --> 16:42.878
<i>Thee fully forth
emerging, silent, gazing,</i>

16:43.003 --> 16:47.091
<i>pondering the themes
thou lovest best."</i>

16:47.424 --> 16:51.387
Oh, my gosh.
It's a good turnout.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.972
Free biscuits brings 'em out.

16:55.683 --> 17:00.521
Hi. Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.356
Everybody is in black.

17:02.481 --> 17:05.609
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We're such babies.

17:05.776 --> 17:08.195
Yeah, fatso from Idaho.
What is-- Oh, my God.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.613
How come no one told me
I had a mullet?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.323
- You look great.
- Put something over it.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.158
- Throw your coat over it...
- Doris, sweetie?

17:13.283 --> 17:14.493
- Yeah.
- How are you holding up?

17:14.618 --> 17:15.828
Oh, Aunt Sarah, I'm okay.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.247
That was a beautiful,
beautiful speech.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.624
I meant every minute of it.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.127
Your dad was
a royal pain in my ass,

17:23.252 --> 17:25.754
but he was a great brother,
and I loved him.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.091
Dom, look at you!

17:29.216 --> 17:31.927
Oh, my God,
you're so big and handsome.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.971
- I'm coming right in.
- Come right in.

17:34.138 --> 17:38.517
It's so good to see you.
I'm really sorry about George.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.644
Thank you.

17:40.811 --> 17:43.147
Last week we had
a big fight

17:43.313 --> 17:47.901
about the politics of agricultural
water in the Central Valley.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.988
I can't even believe that's
the last thing we talked about.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.991
- He loved to fight about water.
- Yeah.

17:54.158 --> 17:57.494
Oh, sweetie, are you okay?

17:57.619 --> 17:59.705
Everybody was so worried
about you.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.499
They kept asking me,
"Who's the weird guy crying?"

18:02.624 --> 18:04.501
Yeah, no.
I'm fine, I'm sorry.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.754
I don't know what came over me.
It's my first funeral. So...

18:06.879 --> 18:09.506
- Really?
- Yeah, but beautiful speech.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.717
Oh, thank you.

18:11.842 --> 18:15.637
You two don't mind, do you,
if I steal Dom away for a few?

18:15.763 --> 18:19.266
Everybody wants to know what he's
been doing for the last 20 years.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.477
Oh, my gosh, no.
Please, it's fine.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.479
You sure you don't want me
to stay with you?

18:23.604 --> 18:27.232
No, go. I'm so sick of you.
Just get out of here. Just go. Go.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.817
- It's fine, please.
- Nothing's changed.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.155
I can't believe
I'm the weird guy.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.908
Just embrace it.

18:37.534 --> 18:41.705
Two... scotch...
Two scotches, neat, please.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.087
Who's that?

18:49.963 --> 18:52.216
It's no one.

18:53.050 --> 18:55.469
God, my dad
loved this place.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.722
He worked so hard
his entire life,

18:58.847 --> 19:00.724
and then after he retired,
he would come here every day

19:00.849 --> 19:04.228
with his buddies and they would get
a scotch and a hamburger

19:04.394 --> 19:05.687
after they would golf.

19:05.813 --> 19:10.067
Dear God, was he an awful,
awful golfer.

19:10.234 --> 19:13.862
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Oh boy.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.244
Oh! For the love of...

19:20.369 --> 19:21.703
Could we do that again?

19:21.829 --> 19:23.288
Maybe throw some soda
in mine, please.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.748
Me too, I think.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.708
I ended up staying here
and marrying

19:26.834 --> 19:29.086
- Diane Rogers from high school.
- No kidding.

19:29.253 --> 19:32.589
Yeah, this is us in Hawaii.
Then this happened.

19:32.714 --> 19:33.966
- They're yours?
- My little guys. Yeah.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.551
- Oh, my God.
- I hope they are.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.261
Steve and Michael.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.137
I can't believe
you stayed here.

19:39.263 --> 19:41.515
I thought for sure you'd end
up working for one of those

19:41.640 --> 19:43.475
- tech companies in Silicon Valley.
- No.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.019
I mean, thanks to you,
everyone passed computer science.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.771
I don't think I could
handle the stress.

19:47.896 --> 19:51.108
Plus, I like it here, you know?
It's my home.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.359
What about you?

19:52.484 --> 19:54.820
Did you and Doris
finally get married?

19:54.945 --> 19:56.738
No, we...

19:57.948 --> 20:00.450
Actually, I'm gay.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.078
Oh, wow, cool.
Good for you.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.205
I love that you're gay.

20:05.289 --> 20:06.456
That's great.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.334
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No, not anymore.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.420
I did. Sort of.

20:11.545 --> 20:14.590
Yeah... That's great, man.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.008
What are you doing
for a living now?

20:16.884 --> 20:18.886
I'm opening a restaurant.

20:19.011 --> 20:20.512
- Like your dad.
- Yeah.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.180
If I come to San Fran,
you gotta hook me up.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.975
Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

20:29.646 --> 20:33.150
So I just came out
to Barry Foster.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.986
- He manages this place.
- You know what?

20:36.153 --> 20:39.197
I think I remember my dad
mentioning that.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.908
It's so sad
that he never left here.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.660
I don't know,
he seems really happy.

20:43.827 --> 20:47.164
He's got a good job,
married, kids.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.125
What was it
about this place again

20:50.250 --> 20:52.669
that I couldn't wait
to get away from?

20:52.794 --> 20:55.839
Oh, let's see.
It was a freak show. We hated it.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.300
We could not wait
to get the fuck out.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.968
My God, just because
it worked for Barry,

21:00.093 --> 21:02.596
it does not mean it would
have ever worked for you.

21:02.721 --> 21:06.016
Dom, if you would have stayed here--
Jesus, your soul would have died.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.935
Totally. And you'd be drunk
and miserable

21:08.018 --> 21:09.978
every night
at the Brave Bull,

21:10.145 --> 21:11.563
and the only thing
you'd have to look forward to

21:11.688 --> 21:13.273
is drag night
with Kitty Leukemia.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.317
Oh God,
I guess you're right.

21:19.863 --> 21:24.701
Before we head back home, you guys
mind if we stop by my dad's grave?

21:24.826 --> 21:26.745
Oh, no, of course.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.375
I need to go in there
and talk to some cousins.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.795
I probably won't see them
until somebody else dies, so...

21:34.920 --> 21:37.464
get in there while
they're alive and kicking.

21:44.638 --> 21:48.100
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good. How are you?

21:48.225 --> 21:50.060
I'm okay.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.445
I can't believe I can't find it.

22:01.530 --> 22:03.991
What does it mean if you can't
find your own dad's grave?

22:04.116 --> 22:07.577
Oh, we are gonna
find it, okay?

22:07.744 --> 22:11.415
It's been a long time.
It makes sense.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.669
Oh, fuck.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.922
My dad's life's work
has become a donut shop

22:19.089 --> 22:21.008
and his own son
can't find his grave.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.843
What kind of a fucking legacy
is that?

22:22.968 --> 22:24.678
- We'll keep looking.
- No, we can go.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.847
It doesn't
even matter at this point.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.601
There's just so much shit
he never got to know about me.

22:32.269 --> 22:34.146
I didn't even get
to come out to him.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.152
You could tell it
to Dave Walker.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.612
They all talk
to each other.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.743
I am sure that he would
have been okay with it.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.876
Fuck it.
Let's go home.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.462
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.130
- Oh, my God.
- I think you gotta do it.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.381
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:01.465 --> 23:02.632
- When, like now?
- Make him hear you.

23:02.758 --> 23:03.967
Make him hear you!
Make him hear you!

23:04.134 --> 23:05.927
I'm gay!

23:06.053 --> 23:07.554
I'm gay, Dad!

23:07.679 --> 23:09.973
He's gay, Mr. Basaluzzo!

23:10.098 --> 23:12.601
I'm a big homo queer!

23:12.726 --> 23:14.478
Oh, my God,
that was incredible!

23:14.561 --> 23:15.812
That felt so good!

23:15.896 --> 23:17.314
I think he definitely
heard--

23:28.950 --> 23:33.121
I can't believe we survived a funeral
only to be sideswiped by a truck.

23:33.246 --> 23:37.793
Yes, that was...
completely fucked up.

23:41.922 --> 23:45.133
Well, it's official.
I'm an orphan.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.512
We both are.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.307
Your mom is alive.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.643
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.687
Anyway,
I'll take care of you.

24:02.818 --> 24:05.195
Hey, Dom.

24:05.362 --> 24:08.740
My Aunt Sarah took me
aside at the reception,

24:08.865 --> 24:11.284
and she told me that my dad
left me some money.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.620
It's enough
for your chicken window.

24:14.788 --> 24:17.124
I want you to have it.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.669
There is nobody that I'd rather
invest in more than you.

24:20.794 --> 24:23.338
You know that?
'Cause you're my family.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.887
I don't know what to say.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.723
Say yes.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.392
Please.

24:35.559 --> 24:37.769
- Okay.
- All right. Good.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.396
Oh, good.
Good.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.022
Thank you.
You're welcome.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.114
Are you--
don't kiss on me.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.409
Just 'cause I give you money doesn't
mean you can get all in my pants.

24:53.827 --> 24:56.288
Dom, I'm so sorry
about the car.

24:56.413 --> 24:58.373
That truck came
out of nowhere.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.085
Don't worry about it.
Insurance will cover it.

25:02.210 --> 25:05.755
- Good.
- How's your arm?

25:05.881 --> 25:07.757
It hurts like hell.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.385
I'm not gonna be able to
masturbate for two weeks.

25:10.510 --> 25:13.013
- Oh, that's rough.
- Yeah.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.598
Doris.

25:16.641 --> 25:19.811
- Hi. You okay?
- No!

25:26.109 --> 25:28.486
It's okay, baby.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.700
It's okay, baby.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.619
You're okay.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.966
Malik, thank you so much
for driving.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.176
No problem.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.512
And, try not to do
any unnecessary high-fiving.

25:54.638 --> 25:57.307
Oh, my God. How long have you
been sitting on that one?

25:57.474 --> 25:59.184
- Since we crossed the Bay Bridge.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

25:59.267 --> 26:00.685
Okay.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.772
Bye.

26:04.648 --> 26:07.651
Bye. Thank you again.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.829
- What the fuck's happened?
- What are you doing here?

26:19.955 --> 26:23.875
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I got into a car accident.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.794
I called you, Patrick,
you never picked up.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.087
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I just--

26:27.170 --> 26:28.922
I've left Jon.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.051
What?

26:36.263 --> 26:40.517
I'm completely fucking
in love with you.

26:40.684 --> 26:43.353
And, I want to know, do you
want to give this a shot,

26:43.520 --> 26:46.314
- just the two of us, together?
- Yes.

26:47.399 --> 26:50.527
- Yeah? Really?
- Yes.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.490
Oh, shit, I'm sorry!
Sorry, sorry.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.867
Sorry.
