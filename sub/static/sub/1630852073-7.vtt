00:00.867 --> 00:02.334
<i>[Tammy] Previously on
1000-lb Sisters.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:08.173
Chris has a weigh-in
with Dr. Smith coming up.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.443
<i>And if he gets approved, he's
gonna get his surgery in the next day.</i>

00:13.813 --> 00:17.850
So, it's just nice to go out
and just let loose for a little bit.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.386
- [wax strips ripping]
- [laughing]

00:21.721 --> 00:22.888
[Therapist]
Can you close that door?

00:22.890 --> 00:25.090
[sighs] This wasn't
[bleep] well thought out.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.032
How are you feeling
right now, Tammy?

00:35.068 --> 00:36.602
I don't know what that means.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.642
<i>[Amy] For a while now,
me and Michael</i>

00:43.644 --> 00:45.577
<i>wanted to move
into a bigger place.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:53.218
I want to do everything in my
power to make Gage happy.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.921
<i>So, I need to get
my life in order.</i>

00:55.923 --> 00:57.923
Let's find out
what this number is,

00:57.925 --> 01:00.292
- and then we'll talk, okay?
- Yeah.

01:09.702 --> 01:10.969
[machine beeps]

01:28.855 --> 01:30.522
Let's find out
what this number is.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.858
All right, hop up here for me.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.193
[Chris] I'm taking my shoes off.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.196
Okay, take your shoes off.
We can do that.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.466
<i>[Chris] Today, me and Tammy have a
follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith.</i>

01:41.034 --> 01:43.102
He wants me under 400 pounds.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.170
So I can get
the surgery tomorrow.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.172
<i>This is it, you know.</i>

01:47.174 --> 01:49.842
<i>Hopefully when I step on the
scale, I've lost enough weight,</i>

01:49.844 --> 01:52.010
so I can be approved
for surgery.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.513
Here we go.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.292
[Dr. Smith speaking]

02:09.095 --> 02:11.163
I thought-- I don't know, Doc.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.098
I've stuck to the diet.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.071
So, I don't know.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.340
[Dr Smith.] Well, let's have
a seat. Let's talk about this.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.948
<i>So, I don't understand it.</i>

02:29.950 --> 02:32.351
All right, so we're not as low
as we wanted to be.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.887
We wanted to get to 400.

02:34.889 --> 02:39.424
Um. Yeah, you know, my job is
to do what's best for you,

02:39.426 --> 02:42.161
and sometimes that may be
an answer you don't wanna hear.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.765
But, you need to
get this weight off,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.400
or we're gonna go
in a bad direction.

02:49.569 --> 02:53.138
So... we're gonna
do your surgery,

02:54.107 --> 02:56.141
just like we had hoped for.

03:03.917 --> 03:04.983
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:09.923 --> 03:11.957
The big deal is...

03:13.159 --> 03:16.328
<i>I've been trying to get
this surgery for 11 years.</i>

03:16.330 --> 03:20.098
So, for him to go ahead
and say that he'd do it,

03:20.800 --> 03:22.134
because I need it.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.836
I really don't care why
he's doing it, he's doing it.

03:24.838 --> 03:28.974
That's a big step
in the right direction for me.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.217
[Dr. Smith] If I did not
have faith in you,

03:38.219 --> 03:41.353
that you could do what I
need you to do, I wouldn't do it.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.889
This is one piece of the puzzle.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.158
And there's been a lot of
things that I've asked you to do

03:46.160 --> 03:50.929
in lifestyle changes that
you've made, that I can prove.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.732
You showed me that you
could lose weight before.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.667
You have done everything
we've asked you to do

03:55.669 --> 03:57.069
with your visits
with your doctor,

03:57.071 --> 03:59.204
and your weigh-ins
and everything like that.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.241
You deserve it,
and that's why we're doing it.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.976
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.678
So, Chris isn't at his goal.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.947
But I look at the big picture
with patients,

04:08.949 --> 04:11.984
and Chris had a lot of things
to overcome from the beginning.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.919
<i>He has changed the way
that he is eating,</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:15.854
<i>and he has changed
his activity level.</i>

04:15.856 --> 04:18.023
And I truly believe Chris
can be compliant,

04:18.025 --> 04:20.525
not only to keep himself
healthy after surgery,

04:20.527 --> 04:22.394
but work towards that goal,
and ultimately,

04:22.396 --> 04:25.130
that's why I gave him the green
light to go ahead with surgery.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.967
Right. It is. It's here.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.603
Okay? All right.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.872
[Brittany]
<i>I'm so proud of him.</i>

04:33.874 --> 04:37.209
<i>He's been working hard towards
his goal and now it's finally here.</i>

04:48.821 --> 04:50.289
[Misty] So what you find out?

04:50.790 --> 04:54.192
[Chris] Well, the weigh-in wasn't
as good as I thought it was gonna be.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.366
He said regardless
of what the scale said,

05:02.001 --> 05:04.136
he's gonna go ahead
and do the surgery.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.044
<i>[Chris] I hope it motivates
Tammy to move forward</i>

05:54.721 --> 05:57.255
[phone dialing]

05:57.257 --> 05:59.491
<i>- [Amy] Hello?
- [Chris] What you doin', bitch?</i>

06:00.293 --> 06:01.360
<i>How'd it go?</i>

06:02.161 --> 06:06.164
Well, your fat ass brother
got approved for surgery.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.342
Tammy didn't gain any,
but she didn't lose any.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.247
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:22.249 --> 06:26.218
I mean, Dr. Smith wants
more steps everyday,

06:26.220 --> 06:31.223
and he wants to see her
back in a month,

06:31.958 --> 06:34.226
to lose 25 pounds.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.727
But

06:41.334 --> 06:44.236
Bye. Love you. Talk to you
when you got some signal.

06:46.038 --> 06:49.174
Chris calls me. He's approved
for surgery and I'm like,

06:49.176 --> 06:52.110
this is a happy day. I mean,
my brother's getting surgery.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.380
He's saving his life, you
know, I've saved my life.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.983
One by one,
we're all getting healthy.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.014
- Okay.
- [laughing]

07:42.395 --> 07:44.563
[Amy] What is it?
What is that?

07:44.565 --> 07:45.664
[toy rattles]

07:45.666 --> 07:46.998
[Michael] What is it?

07:55.942 --> 07:57.943
And he's getting into
your games over there.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.611
- [Amy] Hey!
- [toy rattles]

07:59.613 --> 08:01.079
- Come play with something you can play with.
- Oh!

08:01.081 --> 08:04.216
- Oh, oh. I knew you were gonna hit your head.
- [toy rattles]

08:08.721 --> 08:11.256
<i>It's just like, tiresome,
trying to keep him out of stuff,</i>

08:11.258 --> 08:13.725
<i>'cause there's not enough room
in this house.</i>

08:13.727 --> 08:16.761
One, he's doing good. He's
doing his milestones and stuff.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.130
Then the other one's like,
he has no room

08:19.132 --> 08:21.066
to do these milestones.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.468
Move your head. Oh!

08:25.371 --> 08:26.972
[grunts]

08:27.173 --> 08:28.540
There we go.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.176
[Michael chuckles]

08:32.945 --> 08:34.279
[laughing]

08:35.214 --> 08:37.549
[Amy] We definitely need
more space.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.150
<i>Me and Michael wanna get
a bigger house</i>

08:39.152 --> 08:42.521
'cause our house is getting
too small for the three of us.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.094
I mean, what do you
wanna do, like,

09:00.740 --> 09:04.276
I think borrowing
would be our best option.

09:04.278 --> 09:08.079
If we wanna paint chalkboard
on the wall for him to draw on,

09:08.081 --> 09:09.481
- we can.
- Yeah.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.584
Yeah, it's ours.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.831
<i>But, Tammy is at a standstill
from her weight.</i>

09:26.833 --> 09:28.466
<i>She hasn't lost.
She hasn't gained.</i>

09:29.168 --> 09:31.770
So, it's time to move.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.205
There's only so much help
I can give a person.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.375
Oh, I was gonna tell you.
Chris called me.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.111
- And he said that he got approved.
- That's good.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.380
But Tammy didn't.

09:49.922 --> 09:53.892
Tammy's clearly not ready
to lose the weight.

09:53.894 --> 09:59.097
She says she's ready. She says
everything that you wanna hear.

10:41.907 --> 10:46.444
He is a feeder. Tammy
don't need nothing like that.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.372
- You wanna look for houses?
- [indistinct]

11:14.374 --> 11:19.044
[Gage babbling]

11:20.279 --> 11:22.147
[both giggle]

11:28.788 --> 11:29.954
[Chris grunts]

11:37.063 --> 11:38.963
- [Misty] Do you?
- Yeah.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.068
<i>Today, I'm having
bariatric surgery,</i>

11:43.070 --> 11:45.470
<i>and Misty's driving us
to the hospital.</i>

11:46.706 --> 11:49.207
This journey,
to get where I'm at right now,

11:49.209 --> 11:52.177
has not been
exactly the easiest.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.346
I don't know how to feel
to be honest.

11:56.582 --> 12:00.885
The next 24 hours
is gonna be pretty wild.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.521
Well, I guess since you guys
are gonna be busy at the hospital,

12:03.523 --> 12:06.157
having surgery and all,
I guess I'll take Tammy out,

12:06.159 --> 12:10.095
and we'll walk around, and
see if I can get her moving again.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.064
- Won't that be good.
- That sounds good.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.133
The worst part of it, you know,

12:15.135 --> 12:18.169
is Tammy started this journey
with Amy.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.473
Now Amy's had her surgery
and moving on.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.676
I started the journey with her.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.979
Well, I'm right here at the
finish line, getting the surgery.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.582
And Tammy's pretty much
back where she started.

12:31.984 --> 12:33.852
But then again,
it's one of those things

12:33.854 --> 12:36.020
she has to do it herself.
We can't do it for her.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.656
I'm upset, but at the same time,

12:38.658 --> 12:41.025
I'm gonna be selfish and do
it anyway, 'cause it's for me.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.361
- You gotta do you.
- Yeah, I gotta do it for me.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.367
So, are you anxious
as [bleep] or...

12:49.369 --> 12:51.736
- I'm-- - just relieved
that it's happening, or...

12:51.738 --> 12:52.937
Yeah, kind of.

12:52.939 --> 12:57.242
Hell, I got to believe that this
moment would never come.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.848
<i>[Brittany] Chris is going
into surgery this morning.</i>

13:03.850 --> 13:09.287
I'm a little nervous,
anxious, I guess.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.222
And just worried.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.025
[Misty] So, you gonna call me
later with an update?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.160
- [Brittany] Yep.
- Okay.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.561
I will.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.130
All right guys, good luck.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.965
- [Chris] Thank you.
- Love you, bubby.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.233
Love you too, sis.

13:23.869 --> 13:27.338
There's always,
that "what if?"

13:28.674 --> 13:31.042
You know, whenever you
have surgery,

13:31.044 --> 13:35.380
what if you don't
wake up or whatever, but...

13:35.781 --> 13:38.216
[sighs deeply]

13:47.126 --> 13:49.060
[nurse] Shoes, clothes,
everything goes in the bag.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.362
Gown, of course,
opens up in the back.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.432
Yeah.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.137
<i>[Dr. Smith] Today, Chris is gonna
have a robotic sleeve gastrectomy,</i>

13:59.139 --> 14:01.472
which is basically where we
are gonna remove

14:01.474 --> 14:04.943
the large portion of his
stomach, about 80% if it.

14:04.945 --> 14:08.546
<i>Kinda take your stomach from
a balloon down to a banana.</i>

14:08.548 --> 14:10.782
And really affect how much
food he can take in,

14:10.784 --> 14:12.450
and cause him to feel full
much quicker.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.055
I love you too. Thank you.

14:24.230 --> 14:28.733
I wanted to call Chris before
his surgery and tell him I love him.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.970
And to be brave and,
just kinda like,

14:31.972 --> 14:34.405
positive vibes before
he goes under the knife.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.353
Bye. [giggles]

15:25.824 --> 15:28.026
[crying]

15:45.577 --> 15:46.978
[Dr. Smith] What's up buddy?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.413
How are you?

15:55.654 --> 15:56.887
I always say,
"If you're not nervous,

15:56.889 --> 15:59.924
I would worry about you more
than if you say that you are."

15:59.926 --> 16:01.859
Supposed to be a little nervous.
That means you care, right?

16:01.861 --> 16:02.927
[Chris] Yeah.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.063
Chris has gone through
a lot of stuff,

16:05.065 --> 16:08.499
to make sure that he's in tip
top shape to have the surgery.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.368
Um, and do well.

16:10.370 --> 16:14.939
<i>Surgery itself, has risks of
cardiac and respiratory issues.</i>

16:14.941 --> 16:17.141
And, with Chris' history
of blood clots,

16:17.143 --> 16:18.910
not only blood clots
in the legs,

16:18.912 --> 16:21.212
but blood clots
that can migrate to the lungs,

16:21.214 --> 16:24.182
called pulmonary embolism,
which can be very, very serious.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.084
All right, buddy.
I'll see you soon.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.719
- All right.
- All right.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.454
- All right. I'll see you.
- [Brittany] Thank you.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.825
I'm feeling a little nervous
and anxious.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.960
<i>It's hard seeing him lay there</i>

16:35.962 --> 16:40.965
getting ready to go into surgery,
'cause he's always the rock.

16:51.710 --> 16:56.180
<i>[Chris] Laying on the bed,
waiting for anesthesia and all that.</i>

16:56.182 --> 16:59.951
<i>Minutes feel like
they're taking weeks.</i>

16:59.953 --> 17:03.421
<i>You know, your nerves
are everywhere on the inside.</i>

17:04.323 --> 17:06.391
I've wanted this
for a very long time.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.226
<i>But</i>

17:10.763 --> 17:12.563
<i>I'm scared.</i>

17:12.565 --> 17:16.167
<i>Ultimately, you're always worried about
not waking up when you get put to sleep.</i>

17:32.451 --> 17:34.886
<i>[Dr. Smith] Immediately, I
see that Chris' liver is pretty big.</i>

17:34.888 --> 17:35.887
[machine beeps]

17:35.889 --> 17:36.988
This can be very serious.

17:36.990 --> 17:40.158
[machine beeps]

17:46.098 --> 17:47.465
[upbeat music playing]

17:58.310 --> 18:00.111
[grunts]

18:11.790 --> 18:14.959
- Hold onto your garters.
- Yeah.

18:14.961 --> 18:20.098
- Okay, so I met Chris downstairs this morning.
- Yeah.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.432
And I took him and Brittany.

18:22.734 --> 18:23.834
Brittany was nervous.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.940
So, how do you feel about him
having his surgery?

18:33.712 --> 18:36.080
I didn't know if you were
feeling left out or not.

19:11.783 --> 19:14.118
I know being that big
is not good for you.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.255
<i>I feel like, with Tammy
having the food addiction,</i>

19:17.257 --> 19:20.558
it is taking her longer
to lose weight,

19:21.093 --> 19:22.860
instead of Amy and Chris.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.095
<i>Although Tammy's not telling me</i>

19:24.097 --> 19:25.730
<i>she feels like
she's left behind,</i>

19:25.732 --> 19:28.065
I kind of feel like
she's feeling that way.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.980
That is very true. And we're
thankful you're not that bad.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.816
But in the same token,
you need to strive

19:45.818 --> 19:47.451
to get better than what you are.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.526
The family's wanting you
to get there a little quicker.

19:57.462 --> 20:02.533
Misty's stressing that how
she is worried about me.

20:13.845 --> 20:14.579
[grunts]

20:35.033 --> 20:37.001
[Tammy speaking]

20:45.877 --> 20:46.577
[chuckles]

20:48.313 --> 20:49.447
[exhales]

20:51.416 --> 20:53.417
[Tammy speaking]

20:54.486 --> 20:55.853
All right.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.289
- Here are menus for you, and I'll be right back...
- Okay, thank you.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.294
I think might go for the omelet.
It's probably one of the best.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.595
Yeah.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.132
I think I'm gettin' a BLT.

21:08.134 --> 21:11.335
You're gonna get bacon?
Turkey bacon?

21:11.337 --> 21:16.073
Well, they ain't got real
bacon, so, get you some tofu.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.075
Aw, hell, no.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.177
[Tammy speaking]

21:20.746 --> 21:22.380
- Do you eat tofu?
- I eat it.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.484
So, are you worried about
Chris going into surgery?

21:26.486 --> 21:27.985
Oh, yeah.

21:27.987 --> 21:33.024
Any surgery on bigger people, or
anyone, in general, is gonna be rough.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.159
Chris seemed like
he was a little hyped.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.061
You know, antsy.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.096
He has every right to be.

21:39.264 --> 21:40.231
True.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.599
[Tammy speaking]

21:54.413 --> 21:56.414
So, where do you see yourself
in five years?

22:06.391 --> 22:07.958
Just no kids.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.062
- Those are big plans to me.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:12.864 --> 22:14.398
[waitress speaking]

22:15.033 --> 22:16.267
Thank you.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.169
That looks good.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.137
Thank you.

22:22.274 --> 22:26.177
So, does dating Phil
bar your diet, and all that?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.411
[Tammy speaking]

22:27.413 --> 22:29.980
At first, dating someone...

22:44.062 --> 22:48.265
In place, since you're out of that
relationship, things will start doin' better.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.934
Oh, yeah. Totally.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.970
[Tammy speaking]

23:16.695 --> 23:18.095
[chuckles]

23:19.197 --> 23:23.067
I don't talk to that
many people as I used to.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.603
I am trying to be more careful.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.445
Mmm-hmm.

23:36.815 --> 23:37.815
[Tammy speaking]

23:47.926 --> 23:51.595
I want to be with somebody
that makes me happy.

23:58.069 --> 23:59.637
Do you think being with somebody

23:59.639 --> 24:01.338
is more important
than your diet?

24:06.778 --> 24:09.647
<i>[Misty] Tammy has a bad habit
of getting into relationships,</i>

24:09.649 --> 24:13.217
<i>and not keeping her focus
where it needs to be.</i>

24:13.219 --> 24:18.989
And I think that her priority should be
more on her diet, instead of the dating.

24:19.758 --> 24:23.060
So, is falling in love
more important than your diet?

24:39.778 --> 24:42.346
[Dr. Smith] So, this morning is
the morning we've been waiting for.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.015
We're gonna do Chris's surgery
and it's been a long time coming.

24:45.017 --> 24:48.219
I'm not sure who's more
excited, myself or Chris.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.554
<i>Um, Chris is gonna
be a challenge.</i>

24:50.556 --> 24:51.889
<i>He's got a lot
of central obesity.</i>

24:51.891 --> 24:54.258
<i>He carries that weight
in his abdomen.</i>

24:54.260 --> 24:57.728
And the robotic technology
helps us deal with patients

24:57.730 --> 24:59.363
who carry a lot of their
weight in their abdomen.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.598
<i>But it's still a challenge.</i>

25:00.999 --> 25:04.001
<i>So, it's go time, now.</i>

25:06.004 --> 25:09.974
I'm just countin' down the
minutes until I can see him again.

25:09.976 --> 25:15.446
Thinking and prayin' and hopin'
that he does well with the surgery.

25:19.651 --> 25:21.519
[machines beeping]

25:27.225 --> 25:28.826
<i>[Dr. Smith] So, today,
in Chris's surgery...</i>

25:28.828 --> 25:30.227
<i>We have to be very careful.</i>

25:30.229 --> 25:33.397
<i>Make sure we have
very meticulous dissection,</i>

25:33.399 --> 25:36.033
<i>because one little thing
goes wrong</i>

25:36.035 --> 25:40.437
<i>can be very difficult to get control of
those issues in a patient Chris's size.</i>

25:41.740 --> 25:43.073
<i>The stomach's large.</i>

25:45.544 --> 25:47.978
<i>Chris's tissue's pretty thick,
as well.</i>

25:50.982 --> 25:53.984
<i>Immediately I see that
Chris's liver's pretty big.</i>

25:54.853 --> 25:56.520
<i>We have to lift that up,
and out of the way.</i>

25:58.223 --> 26:00.190
<i>This can be very serious.</i>

26:00.192 --> 26:01.926
[machines bleeping]

26:01.928 --> 26:05.596
[Amy] Look at that little
house. It's right next to the park.

26:05.598 --> 26:10.134
This time, Tammy's not gonna
change my mind about buying a house.

26:12.604 --> 26:17.074
[Amy] They say fat people are so
nice instead and stuff, that bitch ain't.

26:27.152 --> 26:31.355
I found three bedroom,
one bath, 1,500 square feet...

26:32.090 --> 26:33.357
[Amy speaking]

26:34.292 --> 26:35.359
[Michael] Oh, yeah.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.094
[Amy speaking]

26:50.375 --> 26:51.475
[Michael speaking]

26:52.811 --> 26:54.011
[Amy] Yeah.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.946
[Michael speaking]

26:57.382 --> 26:59.350
No. I need to call them.

27:04.923 --> 27:05.889
[phone ringing]

27:05.891 --> 27:07.224
I wonder how everything went.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.226
<i>- [Misty] Amy?
- Hey, what's up?</i>

27:09.228 --> 27:10.194
How's Chris?

27:17.135 --> 27:20.037
That's a big relief.
I'm glad he's doin' well.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.973
[Misty on the phone]

27:22.975 --> 27:25.409
[Amy] Yeah, 'cause I remember
how it was when I was in surgery.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.044
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:30.582 --> 27:33.484
[Amy] When I first got out of surgery,
they were trying to wake me up,

27:33.486 --> 27:36.153
and I was still
a little groggy from the...

27:42.994 --> 27:46.664
So, I was tryin' to take off my
clothes, and the nurse looked at me,

27:46.666 --> 27:50.100
and goes, "Ma'am, you can't take off
your clothes. There's a dude right there."

27:50.102 --> 27:53.003
I was like, "What? He ain't
seen a damn [bleep] before?"

27:53.138 --> 27:55.039
How's Tammy doin'?

27:55.041 --> 27:57.241
<i>Surprisingly,
she's in a good mood,</i>

27:57.243 --> 28:00.878
<i>but I think she's upset
that she's not having surgery.</i>

28:00.880 --> 28:03.914
I mean, she's only got herself
to blame.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.451
<i>Well, I tried talking to her a
little bit this morning about it,</i>

28:07.453 --> 28:10.521
<i>and she seems like she's more
focused on her relationships</i>

28:10.523 --> 28:14.925
<i>than worrying about her addiction,
or whatever you wanna call it.</i>

28:14.927 --> 28:18.662
I don't know what's goin' on with
her, but I asked her the other day,

28:18.664 --> 28:23.067
if she's heard from Phillip, or
anything. And she's like, "No."

28:23.069 --> 28:26.503
And then she shuts down, and
like, "I don't wanna talk about it."

28:26.505 --> 28:29.073
You know how she gets sometimes.

28:29.075 --> 28:32.576
<i>Well, I'm really hoping we
were done with the BBW king.</i>

28:32.578 --> 28:34.144
Oh, me too.

28:34.146 --> 28:38.115
<i>Why Tammy's talking to Phillip
again. But here's hoping she's not.</i>

28:38.117 --> 28:41.218
He's not good for Tammy,
because he likes big women.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.722
He said he'd dump a woman
if she got under 300 pounds.

28:44.724 --> 28:48.158
I don't care who Tammy's dating,
but when it comes to her health,

28:48.160 --> 28:51.962
you ain't gonna come here
and feed my sister to death.

28:51.964 --> 28:55.232
[Amy] Okay, well, thank you
for updating me on Chris.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.501
And I love you,
and I'll talk to you later.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.070
<i>- All right, love you.
- Love you too.</i>

29:00.572 --> 29:01.605
<i>- Bye bye.
- Bye.</i>

29:14.052 --> 29:15.252
- Hello.
- Hello.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.296
[beeping]

29:30.401 --> 29:31.568
[Brittany whispers] Hey.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.255
[knocking on door]

29:52.123 --> 29:53.257
- Hey.
- [Brittany] Hey.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.259
How's he doin'?

29:55.261 --> 29:56.960
He says he feel like
he got beat up.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.328
[laughing]

29:58.330 --> 30:01.031
I'll see if I can't find
that guy that did it to you.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.766
Chris's surgery went great.

30:02.768 --> 30:05.803
I've reduced Chris's capacity
of his stomach,

30:05.805 --> 30:09.106
down to about a tenth
of what it could hold before.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.310
- Your stomach's hurtin'?
- Yeah.

30:13.545 --> 30:17.247
So, that's from the incisions, but
mostly incisions are really small.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.951
It's from the gas. We put
gas, or CO2, inside your belly

30:20.953 --> 30:24.188
to kind of blow things up
so we can see.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.957
It will get better, and I'll get
you some medicine for that too.

30:26.959 --> 30:30.861
So I need you, a little bit later today,
once you get a little bit more awake,

30:30.863 --> 30:35.265
do a bunch of walkin' for me,
and that'll make it go away. Okay?

30:35.267 --> 30:38.869
And work on sipping constantly with
those fluids that they're gonna bring you,

30:38.871 --> 30:40.504
and you'll have protein in it,
okay?

30:41.206 --> 30:42.940
Any time we operate on patients,

30:42.942 --> 30:45.275
we have to discuss
risks and complications.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.578
<i>[Dr. Smith] If his pain
continues,</i>

30:47.580 --> 30:50.113
<i>then we have to start looking for
other things that could be going on.</i>

30:50.115 --> 30:54.084
<i>Signs of internal bleeding. If he starts
running a fever and his heart rate gets high,</i>

30:54.086 --> 30:55.285
<i>we also would want to make sure</i>

30:55.287 --> 30:57.988
<i>that he doesn't show signs
of leak.</i>

30:58.389 --> 31:00.023
Do you need anything right now?

31:01.092 --> 31:03.060
[exhaling]

31:03.062 --> 31:05.963
All right, it's gonna get better,
I promise. I'll see you guys.

31:18.076 --> 31:19.142
[groans]

31:25.083 --> 31:25.983
[exhales]

31:25.985 --> 31:29.853
I am worried about Chris
after the surgery.

31:29.855 --> 31:34.157
You don't wanna eat, drink. You
don't even wanna look at nobody.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.059
The pain, it ain't normal.

31:45.103 --> 31:47.070
[Amy speaking]

31:56.848 --> 31:58.048
[chuckles]

31:58.050 --> 32:01.551
Tammy's clearly not ready
to lose the weight.

32:01.553 --> 32:05.355
So, me and Michael are trying
to find another place that's bigger.

32:10.361 --> 32:13.830
So, today, we dropped off Gage
at his granny's.

32:13.832 --> 32:17.634
It's the perfect opportunity to look
around at different neighborhoods

32:17.636 --> 32:19.303
on where we want to live.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.978
I wanna be able to have
Thanksgiving dinners at our house.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.513
Oh, yeah.

32:41.693 --> 32:45.929
When I was growing up, we were
dirt poor, so there was no option to buy.

32:45.931 --> 32:51.301
I'm not rich by any means, but I'm
more well-off than I was when I was a kid.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.570
Because the money I get
from YouTube,

32:53.572 --> 32:57.307
we've been saving it up
so we can buy a house,

32:57.309 --> 33:00.177
and have a stable environment
for Gage.

33:01.946 --> 33:03.046
[Michael] There's a park.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.159
[Michael speaking]

33:16.161 --> 33:18.996
Me and Michael were driving around
the neighborhood we really liked,

33:18.998 --> 33:21.965
and we found a place for sale.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.134
It's ten minutes away
from Michael's mom's.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.535
It's five minutes away
from mine.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.271
It's perfect for us.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.113
Yeah.

33:41.185 --> 33:45.889
Like in my bones, I think that
house is our forever house.

33:45.891 --> 33:49.159
I can see Gage,
being 16 and 17...

33:50.895 --> 33:51.962
[laughing]

33:55.700 --> 33:57.067
[Amy] 2-7-0...

34:00.238 --> 34:01.872
[Amy] So, we pull over
and get the number,

34:01.874 --> 34:04.975
and now we just gotta call
and see what happens.

34:04.977 --> 34:09.312
<i>This time, Tammy's not gonna
change my mind about buying a house.</i>

34:19.524 --> 34:22.125
[laughs]

34:22.127 --> 34:26.296
They say fat people are so
nice and stuff, that bitch ain't.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.598
[both laughing]

34:35.039 --> 34:36.273
Here we go.

34:36.774 --> 34:38.542
[exhales]

34:38.544 --> 34:44.114
[Chris] This hurts. But I'm
feeling a little bit better, and...

34:46.117 --> 34:50.720
The first day that the surgery
was done, it sucked really bad.

34:50.722 --> 34:56.393
Any time you jerked, hiccupped,
burped, all that was painful.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.537
You don't wanna eat, drink. You
don't even wanna look at nobody.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.042
[exhales]

35:12.276 --> 35:13.376
[door knocking]

35:14.212 --> 35:17.080
[giggling]

35:24.155 --> 35:26.590
[giggling]

35:40.404 --> 35:42.772
So how you feelin'?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.007
A little sore.

35:44.009 --> 35:47.043
The only big thing is, every
time you fart and you belch,

35:48.913 --> 35:50.380
[laughing]

35:50.382 --> 35:54.384
The best pressure release off
my stomach after the surgery,

35:54.785 --> 35:58.054
is belching and fartin'.

35:58.056 --> 36:00.323
Even though it makes me a
lot like my sisters, I don't care,

36:00.325 --> 36:01.558
because it feels so good.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.994
[laughing]

36:05.029 --> 36:06.129
Well, now...

36:07.331 --> 36:08.565
Oh, my God.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.002
[Misty] Why you got five holes?

36:12.004 --> 36:15.205
This is the biggest hole, and the
reason why it's the biggest hole,

36:16.007 --> 36:17.207
what stomach he did remove...

36:17.209 --> 36:18.808
[Misty] Come out through there?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.577
[Chris] They pulled it out
through that little hole.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.979
- So...
- I'm jealous.

36:24.782 --> 36:27.117
I think his has always
been bigger than mine.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.485
Even when I was a teenager.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.820
[laughing]

36:30.822 --> 36:33.523
- I'm [bleep] jealous [bleep].
- [all laughing]

36:37.328 --> 36:41.331
Well, I was just blessed
with man boobs.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.533
[laughing]

36:48.973 --> 36:50.140
[Brittany laughs]

36:55.947 --> 36:57.180
You get the kids' meal?

36:59.483 --> 37:01.017
[all laughing]

37:01.152 --> 37:05.388
Now that I've had the surgery, everything
I learned has to be put to the test

37:06.591 --> 37:09.292
there in the next six months
of recovery.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.094
Because...

37:13.297 --> 37:17.567
<i>My life's about to change, and
that's what is really kind of scary.</i>

37:17.569 --> 37:21.271
Because everything's
gonna change for sure, now.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.576
[Tammy speaking]

37:34.085 --> 37:37.354
The situation with Phillip
got way out of hand.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.364
[Tammy speaking]

40:01.065 --> 40:04.334
<i>[man] Still to come. This
season on 1,000-lb Sisters...</i>

40:08.005 --> 40:10.006
- [Michael] Here we go!
- [Amy] Over this...

40:14.011 --> 40:15.078
[laughing]

40:15.080 --> 40:18.047
- Happy birthday, tater bud.
- [Amy] Eat it.

40:18.049 --> 40:21.050
- [woman] Yeah, there we go.
- [Amy] That's my boy.

40:21.118 --> 40:24.220
[cheering]

40:26.824 --> 40:29.893
- Everybody say, "Whiskey."
- [all] Whiskey!

40:29.895 --> 40:32.562
We're goin'
on a family vacation, y'all.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.097
Whoo!

40:34.298 --> 40:37.000
Are you ready? Let's get you
up in the air, and have some fun.

40:37.002 --> 40:41.771
Roller-coasters has been something
Chris has wanted to do for 20 years.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.239
Sit up taller for me.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.175
- I can't.
- You can't? That's it?

40:45.177 --> 40:47.577
The safety light on the harness

40:49.880 --> 40:51.347
[man] Sorry about that.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.082
Hell with that [bleep].

40:53.084 --> 40:55.285
That's not cool.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.387
[Amy] She's a church lady.
We're whores.

40:57.822 --> 41:00.590
My sister, Amanda,
has no filter.

41:06.931 --> 41:10.800
[Amy] Okay. I'm done. Tell your
[bleep] boy in Las Vegas, hello.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.102
This [bleep] time
for [bleep] real.

41:18.742 --> 41:22.178
<i>I've tried to push her. I've
tried everything in my power.</i>

41:22.180 --> 41:24.180
<i>She don't want
to put in the work.</i>

41:24.182 --> 41:26.483
Tammy, we're leaving
for the new place.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.651
[Tammy] Okay! [bleep] leave!
Whatever.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.553
Bye.

41:30.555 --> 41:34.057
<i>So, I'm gonna have to take
myself out of that situation.</i>

41:34.059 --> 41:35.492
Bye, bitch.

41:39.430 --> 41:42.832
We can make some screwdrivers,
margaritas, we got moonshine.

41:42.834 --> 41:43.967
Ooh.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.935
- [Phillip] To the queen.
- [all] To the queen!

41:45.937 --> 41:48.671
The problem is, by the
time she hits rock bottom,

41:48.673 --> 41:51.574
she goin' to be too far gone
to come out and recover.

41:51.576 --> 41:53.243
<i>Maybe gettin' Dr. Smith
down here</i>

41:53.245 --> 41:56.713
will snap her out of it, and
give us a glimmer of hope.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.648
I wanna help you however I can.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.950
So, tell me how things
are goin'. What you been into?

42:00.952 --> 42:06.089
Mostly partyin', drinkin'.
Maybe eight bottles a week.

42:07.825 --> 42:09.893
She's on a downward spiral.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.728
And it's terminal.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.264
[Tammy] I needed
to just take a break.

42:14.266 --> 42:19.135
And not think about diets,
relationships. I just wanna be free.
