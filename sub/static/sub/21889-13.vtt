24:32.262 --> 24:33.972
I mean, do you remember my lisp?

24:34.556 --> 24:37.559
At the time,
it theemed like a thignificant ithue.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.438
Maybe I overreacted.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.067
I did deny the friendliest woman
in the world my lemon square recipe.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.989
You bought those at Trader Joe's.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.203
That's why I didn't give her the recipe.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.001
Hey, Tommy, can we talk?

25:03.585 --> 25:05.670
Well, I can talk. No pressure on your end.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.676
You did a great job today,
so you get a gold star.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.594
[Tommy] OK.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.513
I found out that
you might need a little extra help,

25:15.597 --> 25:17.015
and I'm gonna get it for you.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.852
Sometimes parents are the last
to see when their kids have problems.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.939
But after I call that nice Miss Emily

25:24.481 --> 25:26.983
and send her over a case of Trader Joe
lemon squares,

25:28.235 --> 25:31.154
which I will put in a Tupperware
and pass off as homemade...

25:32.447 --> 25:35.283
you're gonna start school at Discovery
in the spring.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.326
OK.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.535
What do you think?

25:37.619 --> 25:39.537
You got it, dude.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.541
Where have I heard that before?

25:48.296 --> 25:50.215
I love you so much.

25:50.882 --> 25:51.841

25:51.925 --> 25:53.593
-What is that?
-[DJ] What?

25:53.677 --> 25:54.803

25:56.429 --> 26:00.350
