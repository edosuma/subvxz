Engaging target.

03:08.528 --> 03:11.696
Firing.

03:13.854 --> 03:16.557
We just took down a
Russian MiG, Mr. President.

03:16.558 --> 03:20.394
Safe to say we are engaged
in a shooting war with Russia.

03:20.395 --> 03:23.730
We're enforcing a no-fly zone.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.218
We just took down

03:25.219 --> 03:26.552
two more MiGs, sir.

03:26.553 --> 03:28.554
I think our message is being received.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.022
No doubt.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.928
This is turning into a rout, Mr. President.

03:39.632 --> 03:40.932
Shall I

03:40.933 --> 03:44.636
reach out to the Russian
foreign minister and

03:44.637 --> 03:47.138
see if maybe they're ready to talk it over?

03:47.139 --> 03:48.840
Not yet.

03:48.841 --> 03:51.443
We have the Russians'
battle plans. I assume

03:51.444 --> 03:53.578
the Ukrainians have already
been briefed, General Kohl.

03:53.579 --> 03:54.879
Yes, sir.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.481
Their forces are spread over Luhansk,

03:56.482 --> 03:58.316
Kharkiv, and Mariupol,

03:58.317 --> 04:00.318
the three Ukrainian cities
listed in the Russian

04:00.319 --> 04:02.354
order of battle as prospective
first-strike targets

04:02.355 --> 04:04.089
- in a ground offensive.
- With American advisors

04:04.090 --> 04:07.058
and equipment embedded in their ranks.

04:07.059 --> 04:09.828
If Maria Ostrov wants to escalate,

04:09.829 --> 04:11.796
it sounds like we're ready.

05:56.801 --> 05:57.850
Hello?

05:57.851 --> 05:59.669
Hello, Mr. Goodwin, this is Arkady

05:59.670 --> 06:00.938
from the Russian Fur Exchange.

06:00.939 --> 06:03.272
Good to hear from you.

06:04.574 --> 06:06.576
We have your second order

06:06.577 --> 06:08.145
shipping in 24 hours.

06:08.146 --> 06:10.047
Any special instructions?

06:10.048 --> 06:12.581
Monday delivery.

06:15.492 --> 06:17.561
Thank you.

06:17.562 --> 06:19.897
You need to get me out of Russia. Please.

06:19.898 --> 06:21.165
Please.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.500
I hear you, Arkady. I should go.

06:23.501 --> 06:25.169
Please! Get me out...

06:25.170 --> 06:27.237
Get me out of Russia. Just get me out.

06:27.238 --> 06:28.872
Hey, hey, listen to me.

06:28.873 --> 06:30.374
I'm taking care of it.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.742
Now hang up the damn phone.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.190
So?

06:47.191 --> 06:48.392
Well, just briefed the DNI.

06:48.393 --> 06:50.260
Good, now you need to brief the president.

06:50.261 --> 06:51.895
Well, Director Ware's already on his way

06:51.896 --> 06:54.097
to the Oval Office. And
Dmitri is an incredible asset.

06:54.098 --> 06:55.365
Yeah, we need to talk about

06:55.366 --> 06:57.701
exfiltrating him, because
once the Russians are ambushed

06:57.702 --> 06:59.803
- I hear you, yeah.
- ...at Mariupol, they will know there's a mole

06:59.804 --> 07:01.404
- in their upper ranks, and then...
- Yes.

07:01.405 --> 07:03.807
- It won't be long before they...
- Henry, Henry, I agree with you.

07:03.808 --> 07:05.342
My next stop is CIA.

07:05.343 --> 07:06.943
Director Ware already
approved the exfiltration.

07:06.944 --> 07:09.812
I... Clock's ticking, I got to go.

07:15.952 --> 07:18.154
What have you got, Ephraim?

07:18.155 --> 07:20.690
HUMINT says the Russians are planning

07:20.691 --> 07:23.259
a massive assault on Mariupol,

07:23.260 --> 07:25.829
one of the three cities on
their list of contingencies.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.297
What exactly is the source

07:27.298 --> 07:29.365
of this intelligence, Director Ware?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.968
It's from our asset inside
Maria Ostrov's inner circle.

07:31.969 --> 07:35.505
I think at this point we
can share with the secretary

07:35.506 --> 07:37.173
that this asset

07:37.174 --> 07:39.841
is being handled by her husband.

07:41.945 --> 07:43.346
Never a dull moment.

07:43.347 --> 07:45.915
How confident are Dr.
McCord and DIA in this asset?

07:45.916 --> 07:47.717
- Highly, sir.
- Good.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.819
Recommend moving all nonessential resources

07:49.820 --> 07:52.588
from Kharkiv and Luhansk to
Mariupol as quickly as possible.

07:52.589 --> 07:55.024
Yes, sir.

07:55.025 --> 07:56.559
Ephraim, could you wait a minute?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.894
Of course.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.797
As you'd expect, our NATO
allies are eager for us

08:00.798 --> 08:03.332
to end this conflict before it expands.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.935
Yes. Chancellor Schulz is
at the top of my call sheet.

08:05.936 --> 08:07.570
Europe's concern is understandable.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.272
Russia's still withholding oil and gas,

08:09.273 --> 08:11.073
wreaking havoc on their infrastructure.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.442
So let's propose a
cease-fire before hundreds

08:13.443 --> 08:16.145
of Ukrainian and Russian
soldiers die at Mariupol.

08:16.146 --> 08:17.480
That's on Maria Ostrov.

08:17.481 --> 08:19.215
I'm not going to appease her, Bess.

08:19.216 --> 08:20.783
What kind of message would that send?

08:20.784 --> 08:23.919
That we want to tamp down hostilities,

08:23.920 --> 08:27.123
put this genie back in the bottle. I...

08:27.124 --> 08:28.424
Let's give Ostrov a way out.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.658
Why should we?

08:29.659 --> 08:31.260
We have the strategic advantage here.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.195
- And we're going to take it.
- But let's not

08:33.196 --> 08:35.464
forget how we got here.

08:35.465 --> 08:38.200
- We cyber-attacked Moscow.
- So what would you propose?

08:38.201 --> 08:39.768
- Unprovoked.
- Telling the world that

08:39.769 --> 08:41.570
Bozek duped us into attacking

08:41.571 --> 08:42.671
- the Russians...
- I'm just saying it's in the mix.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.006
so we would get behind Ukraine?

08:44.006 --> 08:45.274
It complicates the situation.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.209
I can't live in complications.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.944
The world doesn't know any of that.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.346
All they know is that the U.S.

08:50.347 --> 08:52.481
- is standing up to Russian aggression.
- Which is

08:52.482 --> 08:54.550
a righteous cause, no
matter the warped path

08:54.551 --> 08:57.719
- that brought us here.
- Well, righteous that may be, but after Mariupol,

08:57.720 --> 09:01.023
Maria Ostrov may send in a million troops

09:01.024 --> 09:03.926
that will overrun
Ukrainian and U.S. forces,

09:03.927 --> 09:06.862
and no amount of Intel will stop her then.

09:06.863 --> 09:08.730
I understand your position, Bess.

09:08.731 --> 09:11.567
But no talk of a cease-fire.

09:11.568 --> 09:13.201
Are we clear?

09:13.202 --> 09:15.002
Yes, sir.

09:15.837 --> 09:17.172
Uh, in the meantime,

09:17.173 --> 09:18.807
I-I would like to see

09:18.808 --> 09:22.009
the profiling that CIA has on Maria Ostrov.

09:23.278 --> 09:25.280
How much have we got, Ephraim?

09:25.281 --> 09:27.048
Mrs. Ostrov's a newbie on the world scene.

09:27.049 --> 09:28.517
Not a whole lot.

09:28.518 --> 09:29.851
This is exactly my point.

09:29.852 --> 09:33.188
But I was there when she
made a play for power.

09:33.189 --> 09:36.658
She does not strike me as
someone to be trifled with.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.860
Due respect, I saw the video.

09:38.861 --> 09:41.563
So she gave a good speech.

09:41.564 --> 09:44.566
Intelligence is of the opinion that

09:44.567 --> 09:46.935
Maria Ostrov is a puppet
of the Russian generals.

09:46.936 --> 09:48.236
A popular prop

09:48.237 --> 09:50.105
with the right last name.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.807
With no political or military background

09:52.808 --> 09:55.110
and very little formal education.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.946
As far as we're concerned,
she's a former beauty queen

09:57.947 --> 09:59.914
- who married up.
- That's all right.

09:59.915 --> 10:02.575
I'd still like to get into it.

10:05.353 --> 10:07.889
Give the Secretary of State
whatever she wants, Ephraim.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.958
Of course, Mr. President.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.559
Great, thanks.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.562
♪ I feel the night explode ♪

10:16.130 --> 10:19.366
♪ When we're together ♪

10:20.501 --> 10:23.338
This is the woman who's
starting World War III?

10:23.339 --> 10:25.606
Looks like she had a little work done

10:25.607 --> 10:28.776
between Teen Miss
Volgograd and Miss Moscow.

10:28.777 --> 10:32.513
Nose job. Breast augmentation.

10:32.514 --> 10:35.283
You nervous about saying breasts
or just objectifying women?

10:35.284 --> 10:37.018
Hey, she's the one chopping up her body

10:37.019 --> 10:38.986
and putting herself into beauty pageants.

10:38.987 --> 10:41.055
If you're trying to land
a major world leader,

10:41.056 --> 10:42.323
you better to work it.

10:42.324 --> 10:44.425
I disagree.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.093
I think Pavel Ostrov would have done

10:46.094 --> 10:48.596
anything she told him to. Nose job,

10:48.597 --> 10:50.731
- boob job or not.
- The woman did

10:50.732 --> 10:53.267
seize the throne of one of
the most powerful nations

10:53.268 --> 10:54.902
on the planet.

10:54.903 --> 10:56.437

10:57.939 --> 10:59.340

10:59.341 --> 11:01.375
So what else do we have on her?

11:01.376 --> 11:03.277
Like Director Ware said, not much.

11:03.278 --> 11:04.778
It really looks like she married up

11:04.779 --> 11:06.180
and never looked back.

11:06.181 --> 11:07.681
That's not helpful.

11:07.682 --> 11:09.984
Her family's working class from Volgograd.

11:09.985 --> 11:11.619
Father worked in a sawmill.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.254
Yet at 19 she moved into

11:13.255 --> 11:14.555
a pretty sweet apartment in Moscow.

11:14.556 --> 11:16.156
Yeah, but she was a beauty queen

11:16.157 --> 11:18.225
and working as a model. I mean,
what's so strange about that?

11:18.226 --> 11:20.027
Modeling locally in Moscow
couldn't cover her rent,

11:20.028 --> 11:21.195
let alone lifestyle.

11:21.196 --> 11:22.496
- Okay?
- Did she have a boyfriend?

11:22.497 --> 11:24.443
- Can't find anything.
- She was first lady

11:24.444 --> 11:26.233
for six years. If she did,
it would have come out.

11:26.234 --> 11:27.434
Unless she didn't want it to.

11:27.435 --> 11:29.036
Or she had a sugar daddy.

11:29.037 --> 11:30.571
Someone paid for that surgery,

11:30.572 --> 11:32.172
yet there's no record of it.

11:32.173 --> 11:34.408
Again, meaning she didn't
want there to be one.

11:34.409 --> 11:37.511
This is all mildly interesting,

11:37.512 --> 11:39.446
but I don't see how it helps our situation.

11:39.447 --> 11:40.747
I don't either.

11:40.748 --> 11:43.650
But events can easily spin out of control.

11:43.651 --> 11:47.321
If there is something that we
can use to leverage this woman,

11:47.322 --> 11:49.022
I want it. Short of that,

11:49.023 --> 11:50.924
I want to understand her better.

11:50.925 --> 11:52.159
Unfortunately, all her

11:52.160 --> 11:53.593
financial documents going back to that time

11:53.594 --> 11:55.429
are through numbered Swiss bank accounts.

11:55.430 --> 11:58.732
Well, that's pretty sophisticated

11:58.733 --> 12:00.934
for a simple girl from Volgograd.

12:00.935 --> 12:02.602
Yeah. But good luck

12:02.603 --> 12:04.938
getting anything out of the Swiss.

12:04.939 --> 12:07.706
That is so weird that
you would just say that.

12:09.142 --> 12:13.112
You're making it my job to
get something out of the Swiss?

12:14.314 --> 12:16.615
Find a way.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.956
Oh. Did you strain your back?

12:22.957 --> 12:24.290
Ah, of course.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.926
Well, now it is officially
Christmas season.

12:26.927 --> 12:29.996
Yeah, if we make it to Christmas.

12:29.997 --> 12:31.898
A little dramatic there, dude.

12:31.899 --> 12:33.633
There are memes all over
BuzzFeed about Russia

12:33.634 --> 12:34.968
going nuclear over Ukraine.

12:34.969 --> 12:36.736
Yeah, I saw one with Maria Ostrov

12:36.737 --> 12:38.438
shooting nuclear missiles out of her eyes

12:38.439 --> 12:40.807
- at Mom and President Dalton.
- Well, that's subtle.

12:40.808 --> 12:42.709
They're saying that this our generation's

12:42.710 --> 12:44.644
Cuban Missile Crisis.

12:44.645 --> 12:47.646
Yeah, and that turned out fine.

12:51.351 --> 12:52.952
Okay, listen, guys. I know it's scary.

12:52.953 --> 12:55.088
But there are a lot of
good people, including Mom,

12:55.089 --> 12:57.824
who are working really hard to
make sure we get to celebrate

12:57.825 --> 13:00.259
plenty more Christmases. That said...

13:00.260 --> 13:03.496
Listen, do not

13:03.497 --> 13:05.798
decorate this tree until Mom gets home.

13:05.799 --> 13:07.400
- Boo!
- If we want to avoid

13:07.401 --> 13:09.869
World War III here.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.304
- Hmm.
- Boo.

13:11.305 --> 13:13.372
- Okay?
- Hmm. Not sure if this

13:13.373 --> 13:15.308
is good or terrifying.

13:15.309 --> 13:17.009
- What?
- It's a news alert.

13:17.010 --> 13:19.612
It's about a battle that happened in some

13:19.613 --> 13:22.715
Ukrainian city... Marr... upol.

13:22.716 --> 13:24.617
- What about it?
- Says

13:24.618 --> 13:27.253
"Ukraine, aided by American advisors,

13:27.254 --> 13:28.621
overwhelmed the Russian forces

13:28.622 --> 13:32.091
and beat them back in a
decisive blow to Russia."

13:32.092 --> 13:33.559
Boom.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.495
Um, oh, you know what?
I have a faculty meeting.

13:36.496 --> 13:37.696
I got to go.

13:37.697 --> 13:39.831
- At 9:00 at night?
- See you guys later.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.102
Yeah, we're a freak show.

13:43.103 --> 13:45.871
- Hey, hi.
- Hey, babe.

13:45.872 --> 13:48.274
Hey, have you heard about Mariupol?

13:48.275 --> 13:51.977
Yeah. It's a big win for Ukraine. And us.

13:51.978 --> 13:54.513
- Thanks to your asset.
- You...

13:54.514 --> 13:56.682
I was finally officially read in.

13:56.683 --> 13:58.350
Then you know he's pretty much blown.

13:58.351 --> 13:59.651
You haven't gotten him out?

13:59.652 --> 14:01.053
- No, I...
- Go.

14:01.054 --> 14:02.254
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

14:02.255 --> 14:03.822
Oh, wait, take this, take this, take this,

14:03.823 --> 14:05.891
- it's freezing out there.
- Good night.

14:05.892 --> 14:08.660
- Hey, gang.
- Hi. - Hey.

14:08.661 --> 14:11.296
Wow, look at that.

14:11.297 --> 14:13.232
Hey, at least we know
the secretary of state

14:13.233 --> 14:15.067
thinks the world is safe
enough to leave work.

14:15.068 --> 14:16.902
Okay.

14:16.903 --> 14:19.871
On that note, I'm gonna
go play Call of Duty.

14:19.872 --> 14:20.722
Wha...

14:20.723 --> 14:23.298
That's a great way to
take your mind off war.

14:24.409 --> 14:26.878
Mom, Does Dad have a
secret job or something?

14:26.879 --> 14:28.814
What? No.

14:28.815 --> 14:31.650
You people are the worst liars.

14:31.651 --> 14:33.051
Oh, I...

14:33.052 --> 14:34.619
I-I just...

14:34.620 --> 14:37.722
I just want to decorate the tree.

14:37.723 --> 14:40.592
I know. String popcorn?

14:40.593 --> 14:42.127
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:42.128 --> 14:44.563
So why aren't you running away from me

14:44.564 --> 14:47.065
like the rest of the family?

14:47.066 --> 14:49.768
Well, um...

14:49.769 --> 14:51.202
I met a guy.

14:51.203 --> 14:53.171
Really?

14:53.172 --> 14:54.372
Yes.

14:54.373 --> 14:55.774
Do tell.

14:55.775 --> 14:57.475
Just one date, settle down.

14:57.476 --> 14:58.777
But we are

14:58.778 --> 15:01.079
in negotiations for the second.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.248
I'm gonna need a little more

15:03.249 --> 15:05.350
- than that.
- Okay. Um...

15:05.351 --> 15:07.485
His name is Jareth,

15:07.486 --> 15:09.754
and he's auditing my psych class,

15:09.755 --> 15:12.690
but he is a graduate student
doing applied physics.

15:12.691 --> 15:13.691
He's a total brainiac.

15:13.692 --> 15:15.660
He's British.

15:15.661 --> 15:19.330
And he's nice. He's got big eyes

15:19.331 --> 15:22.466
and a really cute butt. He's tall...

16:09.079 --> 16:10.713
DA.

17:00.665 --> 17:02.599
Hey.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.969
I just got off the
phone with Dmitri Petrov.

17:05.970 --> 17:08.204
He'd like to know why we're
hanging him out to dry.

17:08.205 --> 17:10.507
- And so would I.
- The situation has changed.

17:10.508 --> 17:14.109
You said that the DNI signed
off on the exfiltration

17:14.111 --> 17:15.779
and you were coordinating with CIA.

17:15.780 --> 17:16.813
Why would that change?

17:16.814 --> 17:18.114
Things are fluid.

17:18.115 --> 17:19.770
In case you haven't
noticed, we're in a war.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.518
I noticed that we crushed
the Russians at Mariupol

17:21.519 --> 17:23.953
based on the intelligence
that Dmitri provided.

17:23.954 --> 17:27.190
- I know.
- You know? Do you also know Maria Ostrov

17:27.191 --> 17:28.692
arrested her own assistant for it?

17:28.693 --> 17:31.261
Because it's only a matter
of time before they figure out

17:31.262 --> 17:33.430
that he's the wrong guy
and they come after Dmitri.

17:33.431 --> 17:34.998
So I really don't care what's changed.

17:34.999 --> 17:37.167
We need to get him out of there now.

17:39.703 --> 17:41.543
Unfortunately, we don't have the resources

17:41.544 --> 17:43.573
- in place to do that.
- Okay.

17:43.574 --> 17:47.810
We are the most powerful nation
this world has ever known.

17:47.811 --> 17:49.646
We can't get this kid on a plane?

17:49.647 --> 17:52.649
The Pentagon has pulled most
of our assets in country.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.884
Until the situation improves,
I'm afraid Dmitri is caught

17:54.885 --> 17:55.577
behind enemy lines.

17:55.578 --> 17:57.453
Get him to our embassy in
Moscow or to a safe house.

17:57.454 --> 18:00.022
We must have someone that can pick him up.

18:00.023 --> 18:02.325
Send me in, for God's sake.

18:02.326 --> 18:05.061
But don't let this kid
who's done everything

18:05.062 --> 18:06.896
we've asked of him die for no reason.

18:06.897 --> 18:08.531
I'm sorry.

18:08.532 --> 18:09.765
Are you?

18:09.766 --> 18:12.301
Are you really? Because
it's starting to seem

18:12.302 --> 18:14.437
like that was part of the plan all along.

18:14.438 --> 18:16.305
When we first met, I
told you that Intelligence

18:16.306 --> 18:17.940
was a vast network.

18:17.941 --> 18:20.076
You're at the bottom of that flowchart.

18:20.077 --> 18:22.410
Now it's your duty to stand down.

18:41.059 --> 18:43.293
Sounds like your boss and President Dalton

18:43.294 --> 18:46.029
have gotten themselves into
quite a contretemps with Russia.

18:46.030 --> 18:47.798
That's one way of looking
at it, Mr. Ambassador.

18:47.799 --> 18:49.232
Another is that we're staring

18:49.233 --> 18:50.767
down the barrel of a nuclear war.

18:50.768 --> 18:54.804
I speak for all of Switzerland
in saying that I sincerely hope

18:54.805 --> 18:56.139
we can avoid that.

18:56.140 --> 18:59.142
Of course. But, unfortunately,
bare-knuckled diplomacy

18:59.143 --> 19:01.211
and a lot of dead soldiers

19:01.212 --> 19:03.879
are most likely going to decide this one.

19:05.148 --> 19:07.183
What do you want?

19:07.184 --> 19:08.451
Belrose Banc Suisse

19:08.452 --> 19:10.887
has Maria Ostrov's entire financial history

19:10.888 --> 19:12.489
going back 20 years.

19:12.490 --> 19:14.390
In private, numbered accounts.

19:14.391 --> 19:15.959
We'd like all of it.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.927
Switzerland has cooperated
with the U.S. when asked

19:17.928 --> 19:20.597
about the financial records
of American citizens.

19:20.598 --> 19:22.332
But for a foreign national,

19:22.333 --> 19:24.567
- a head of state, no less?
- I know it's a big ask.

19:24.568 --> 19:26.002
It's impossible.

19:26.003 --> 19:28.771
I also know you'd like a
Winter Olympics in Gstaad.

19:28.772 --> 19:31.240
My government's support would
go a long way toward sticking

19:31.241 --> 19:33.242
that landing.

19:33.243 --> 19:34.911
A lovely offer.

19:34.912 --> 19:38.715
But the Federal Council
will laugh in my face.

19:38.716 --> 19:42.585
We will not participate
in such improprieties.

19:42.586 --> 19:45.488
Impropr... Really?

19:45.489 --> 19:46.923
Hey, we're not done.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.625
I know historically your
little mountain fiefdom

19:49.626 --> 19:50.960
has managed to stay neutral

19:50.961 --> 19:53.663
in the middle of every European conflict.

19:53.664 --> 19:56.632
Two world wars, Fascists, Nazis.

19:56.633 --> 19:58.601
That worked out great for you.

19:58.602 --> 20:00.503
With millions of people
from other countries

20:00.504 --> 20:01.804
dying for your freedom.

20:01.805 --> 20:04.340
But, see, now, now there are B-2 bombers,

20:04.341 --> 20:06.208
EMP strikes, ICBMs

20:06.209 --> 20:08.244
with nuclear payloads!

20:08.245 --> 20:11.113
This time, the chaos
is taking you down, too.

20:11.114 --> 20:13.282
So if preventing World War
III doesn't motivate you,

20:13.283 --> 20:15.584
how about a little naked self-interest?!

20:17.454 --> 20:18.921
Ma'am.

20:18.922 --> 20:21.190
I know. I know. Every NATO ally

20:21.191 --> 20:22.725
is gunning for a cease-fire.

20:22.726 --> 20:24.226
They're calling me at home.

20:24.227 --> 20:25.928
How do they even get that number?

20:25.929 --> 20:27.062
This isn't about the cease-fire.

20:27.063 --> 20:29.531
Oh, crap. That thing.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.634
It's Maria Ostrov. Five minutes ago.

20:31.635 --> 20:33.002
America claims Russia

20:33.003 --> 20:35.971
hacked President Dalton's
Air Force One plane.

20:35.972 --> 20:38.640
But, really, it was the United States

20:38.641 --> 20:41.176
and Ukraine colluding together.

20:41.177 --> 20:44.880
These devious nations
created a fake hack story

20:44.881 --> 20:48.350
as a pretense for America's
imperialist aggression

20:48.351 --> 20:50.352
and to keep ethnic Russians

20:50.353 --> 20:52.721
in Eastern Ukraine imprisoned

20:52.722 --> 20:55.290
by the criminal Bozek administration.

20:55.291 --> 20:59.661
I challenge the warmonger
President Dalton to deny it.

20:59.662 --> 21:01.296
Russia will not be intimidated...

21:01.297 --> 21:02.965
That's enough. I get the gist.

21:02.966 --> 21:04.299
How do you want to respond?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.601
By resigning and crawling under a rock.

21:06.602 --> 21:07.769
But since that's not an option,

21:07.770 --> 21:09.571
let's do a full staff meeting now.

21:09.572 --> 21:12.407
Before I get summoned by
our warmongering president.

21:12.408 --> 21:15.743
Jay's still meeting with
the Swiss ambassador.

21:19.347 --> 21:21.283
Jay. Jay.

21:21.284 --> 21:23.385
- Mr. Ambassador. Bonjour.
- Madam Secretary, your policy man

21:23.386 --> 21:24.853
needs a lesson in diplomacy.

21:24.854 --> 21:27.055
Jay's very passionate. If
it makes any difference,

21:27.056 --> 21:28.757
he yells at me, too.

21:28.758 --> 21:30.725
But here's the thing.

21:30.726 --> 21:33.895
Events are unfolding quickly,
and we need every advantage

21:33.896 --> 21:36.998
we can get. Specifically,
Maria Ostrov's bank records.

21:36.999 --> 21:39.534
You might have noticed
we're pretty good at hacking,

21:39.535 --> 21:42.003
though I'm not admitting
anything about what happened

21:42.004 --> 21:43.905
in Moscow. But we're
gonna get those records

21:43.906 --> 21:46.374
one way or the other. And given

21:46.375 --> 21:48.409
the state of the world right now,

21:48.410 --> 21:50.745
I think you want to stay on our good side.

21:50.746 --> 21:53.281
So you tell that to your Federal Council.

21:53.282 --> 21:55.215
Thanks so much for coming in.

22:00.822 --> 22:02.790
- I'd say pardon my French, but...
- Things just got

22:02.791 --> 22:04.759
real complicated, and I have to go listen

22:04.760 --> 22:06.227
to the president freak out right now.

22:06.228 --> 22:08.128
So you just keep the
heat on the Swiss, okay?

22:08.129 --> 22:08.730
Oui, oui.

22:08.731 --> 22:09.831
- Madam Secretary...
- White House.

22:09.832 --> 22:11.866
Now. Way ahead of you.

22:11.867 --> 22:14.602
And I'm obsolete.

22:14.603 --> 22:17.638
How the hell did Russia find
out that Ukraine was involved

22:17.639 --> 22:19.140
in the Air Force One hack?

22:19.141 --> 22:20.842
Do we have a leaker, Director Ware?

22:20.843 --> 22:22.276
We're investigating, sir,

22:22.277 --> 22:24.045
though it could've come
from the Ukrainians.

22:24.046 --> 22:26.280
Well, as much as I would
love to put someone in front

22:26.281 --> 22:28.216
of a firing squad for this,

22:28.217 --> 22:30.451
the real question is,
where do we go from here?

22:30.452 --> 22:31.519
Our official response

22:31.520 --> 22:33.487
is to deflect any questions

22:33.488 --> 22:36.757
and say that any pertinent information

22:36.758 --> 22:38.059
remains classified.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.727
So, basically, an admission
that it's all true.

22:42.663 --> 22:44.365
Thanks, Ephraim.

22:44.366 --> 22:45.399
Thank you, Mr. President.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.667
Madam Secretary.

22:52.574 --> 22:54.841
I need some air.

22:55.543 --> 22:56.911
I'm guessing

22:56.912 --> 22:58.812
our allies aren't even
pretending to support us

22:58.813 --> 23:00.948
- on this anymore.
- We can't

23:00.949 --> 23:03.951
continue fighting if we
look like the aggressor.

23:03.952 --> 23:05.986
You want to signal we're
open to peace talks.

23:05.987 --> 23:07.221
The French, Germans,

23:07.222 --> 23:10.224
the British, and just
about every other NATO ally

23:10.225 --> 23:12.693
is pushing hard for a summit in Geneva.

23:12.694 --> 23:14.094
From a position of weakness.

23:14.095 --> 23:15.562
I'm not so sure that's true.

23:15.563 --> 23:18.165
My read:

23:18.166 --> 23:20.667
Maria Ostrov got frustrated
on the battlefield,

23:20.668 --> 23:22.169
so she made a lateral move

23:22.170 --> 23:24.738
and she hit us on the diplomatic front.

23:24.739 --> 23:26.607
You think she's ready to deal.

23:26.608 --> 23:28.275
I think every minute she doesn't

23:28.276 --> 23:30.577
order an all-out assault
and flatten every inch

23:30.578 --> 23:33.747
of Eastern and Western Ukraine
is reason for encouragement.

23:33.748 --> 23:36.249
Okay.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.052
If the Russians agree,
we'll go to the table.

23:39.053 --> 23:41.755
Drag the Ukrainians with us.

23:41.756 --> 23:44.056
Yeah.

23:49.329 --> 23:50.964
- ...chronological order.
- Elizabeth.

23:50.965 --> 23:52.365
- That's it. Thanks.
- Okay.

23:52.366 --> 23:54.467
Hey. I was in the middle
of planning a peace summit

23:54.468 --> 23:56.369
- when you called.
- This won't take long.

23:56.370 --> 23:58.038
So much for the victory lap

23:58.039 --> 24:00.073
about getting the Russians to come along.

24:00.074 --> 24:02.542
And if you say that's my job,
I'm gonna punch you in the nose.

24:02.543 --> 24:05.812
You get 'em to sign the damn
treaty, I'll do pirouettes.

24:05.813 --> 24:07.380
Madam Secretary, I
believe you're acquainted

24:07.381 --> 24:09.349
- with Dr. Henry McCord.
- Hi, babe.

24:09.350 --> 24:11.851
Hi. Yeah, we've met once or twice.

24:11.852 --> 24:16.456
And this is Jane Fellows,
his, uh, handler with DIA.

24:16.457 --> 24:18.658
His handler. Of course.

24:18.659 --> 24:20.026
Madam Secretary.

24:20.027 --> 24:21.995
I'm glad to see you don't know who I am.

24:21.996 --> 24:23.463
We actually prefer it that way.

24:23.464 --> 24:26.699
Oh. Uh...

24:26.700 --> 24:29.702
- so why do I need to know you now?
- I understand

24:29.703 --> 24:31.804
that Mr. Jackson and the
president recently read you

24:31.805 --> 24:33.773
into your husband's work with us

24:33.774 --> 24:35.775
handling Captain Dmitri Petrov.

24:35.776 --> 24:37.010
Hell of an asset.

24:37.011 --> 24:38.745
Whose time is quickly running out.

24:38.746 --> 24:41.514
We couldn't exfiltrate him from
Moscow, but we caught a break.

24:41.515 --> 24:43.649
Petrov will be accompanying
General Doroshevich

24:43.650 --> 24:45.385
to your peace talks in Geneva.

24:45.386 --> 24:48.221
Sounds like a friendlier
environment to bring him in.

24:48.222 --> 24:49.856
- What do you need from me?
- Just take

24:49.857 --> 24:51.357
your husband to Geneva with you.

24:51.358 --> 24:53.593
He's the only American Petrov trusts.

24:53.594 --> 24:59.232
So Henry's cover will be as arm candy?

24:59.233 --> 25:00.366
Well, look at the guy.

25:00.367 --> 25:04.236
I can be there to pick
up Petrov personally.

25:04.237 --> 25:07.338
Easy as that.

25:10.276 --> 25:14.780
You seem pretty comfortable
with all this spy stuff.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.482
I married one.

25:16.483 --> 25:19.251
I'm glad you're getting your guy out.

25:19.252 --> 25:22.021
Me, too. I-I find the whole

25:22.022 --> 25:25.357
"not getting personally
invested" thing challenging.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.759
I know.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.694
It's one of the many
things I love about you,

25:28.695 --> 25:31.630
Dr. Henry McCord.

25:31.631 --> 25:35.367
That and your total arm-candy-ness.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.973
Want to make out in the rose garden?

25:40.974 --> 25:43.609
Maybe I can score a key
to the Lincoln Bedroom.

25:43.610 --> 25:46.545
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.881
- Oh.
- Oh.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.319
Okay.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.488
Rain check?

25:56.489 --> 25:58.789
Rain check.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.829
So, what?

26:03.830 --> 26:07.032
You found corruption in Maria
Ostrov's financial records?

26:07.033 --> 26:09.034
Nope.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.735
Better.

26:17.609 --> 26:21.113
Okay, you guys are kind of freaking me out

26:21.114 --> 26:24.848
with the "cat that ate the
canary" looks. What's...

26:26.117 --> 26:28.286
What's better than corruption?

26:28.287 --> 26:31.189
Try murdering Russia's beloved president.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.159
Murder? A-As in...

26:34.160 --> 26:36.328
murder?

26:36.329 --> 26:37.662
Pavel Ostrov

26:37.663 --> 26:40.164
- had an embolism.
- He did.

26:41.966 --> 26:44.536
Okay. Let's hear it, Columbo.

26:44.537 --> 26:47.405
Meet Dr. Yakov Maklovsky.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.240
Maria Ostrov's plastic surgeon.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.508
As far as we can tell, he was

26:50.509 --> 26:53.344
her sponsor when she started
out as a beauty queen.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.880
We think that he gave her
the rhinoplasty and the...

26:55.881 --> 26:57.081
boob augmentation.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.850
Which is probably how they met.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.352
He also built his practice on

27:01.353 --> 27:04.322
the open secret that he helped
turn her into Miss Russia.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.591
The trail of wire transfers
that Maria made to the guy

27:06.592 --> 27:08.259
extends over the next 20 years.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.427
For nips, tucks, Botox.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.195
Okay. Get-get to the murder part.

27:11.196 --> 27:15.266
Two months ago, Maria makes
a million dollar "donation"

27:15.267 --> 27:17.135
to Maklovsky's clinic. A week later,

27:17.136 --> 27:19.470
Pavel Ostrov goes missing.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.538
But he wasn't really missing.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.306
Right. DIA uncovered that he was getting

27:22.307 --> 27:24.208
a tummy tuck in a Moscow hospital.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.178
That same Intel reveals that his surgeon

27:27.179 --> 27:29.913
was none other than Dr. Maklovsky.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.751
Uh, interesting

27:33.752 --> 27:37.755
- but that's a pretty tenuous connection.
- Well,

27:37.756 --> 27:39.590
does it make it a little less tenuous

27:39.591 --> 27:42.226
if the day after Ostrov died

27:42.227 --> 27:45.062
Maria transferred another million dollars

27:45.063 --> 27:47.198
into Maklovsky's account?

27:47.199 --> 27:50.668
A little. That's a lot of rubles.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.071
Well, it would be very nice to get this...

27:54.072 --> 27:56.307
Maklovsky in a room, huh?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.909
- That's gonna be hard.
- He's dead.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.911
Killed in a violent mugging in Moscow

28:00.912 --> 28:02.980
one week after Pavel Ostrov died.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.748
Okay, but wait a second.

28:04.749 --> 28:09.153
We still don't have anything
that directly connects Maria

28:09.154 --> 28:11.855
- or Maklovsky...
- Except this.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.692
DIA's source in the hospital
was able to get us a list

28:14.693 --> 28:16.727
of every prescription
that Maklovsky wrote during

28:16.728 --> 28:19.730
that two-week period,
including one for Progestafil.

28:19.731 --> 28:23.433
A rarely used, injectable, blood coagulant.

28:23.434 --> 28:25.802
NIH said that in extreme doses,

28:25.803 --> 28:27.905
it could cause an embolism

28:27.906 --> 28:31.441
in someone who recently had surgery.

28:31.442 --> 28:35.646
Official reports say Mr.
Ostrov died in his sleep.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.948
Meaning, if we're right,

28:37.949 --> 28:41.818
it's probable that the
death blow was delivered

28:41.819 --> 28:44.086
by Maria Ostrov.

28:46.623 --> 28:48.725
So,

28:48.726 --> 28:52.362
Maria Ostrov wants to
get rid of her husband

28:52.363 --> 28:55.198
so that she can take over
the Russian presidency.

28:55.199 --> 28:59.002
And she uses Pavel's
surgery as an opportunity

28:59.003 --> 29:02.839
to enlist her old doctor
friend to set things up

29:02.840 --> 29:06.209
so that her husband appears

29:06.210 --> 29:10.447
to die of post-surgical complications.

29:10.448 --> 29:13.717
And then she pays the good doctor

29:13.718 --> 29:16.319
two million dollars for his troubles.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.388
And Maria could easily

29:18.389 --> 29:20.857
have had her goons take
the good doctor out, leaving

29:20.858 --> 29:22.992
no one left alive who knows what she did.

29:22.993 --> 29:26.856
Pavel Ostrov was the Ronald Reagan

29:26.857 --> 29:28.364
of recent Russian history.

29:28.365 --> 29:31.134
He was their most popular
leader of the last,

29:31.135 --> 29:34.637
oh, 50 years, so...

29:34.638 --> 29:37.907
If it ever got out that Maria
killed him, she'd be done.

29:37.908 --> 29:40.009
The problem is...

29:40.010 --> 29:42.045
it's all circumstantial.

29:42.046 --> 29:44.647
All right, see if you can get your hands

29:44.648 --> 29:45.882
on Pavel Ostrov's autopsy.

29:45.883 --> 29:51.020
If we want to stick it
to Maria Ostrov in Geneva,

29:51.021 --> 29:53.622
we're gonna need proof.

30:08.823 --> 30:10.515
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

30:10.516 --> 30:13.590
President Bozek sent
Foreign Minister Melnik

30:13.591 --> 30:16.127
to represent Ukraine in his place.

30:16.128 --> 30:18.285
At his country's most consequential moment,

30:18.286 --> 30:20.134
Bozek bails.

30:20.135 --> 30:21.635
Just like he did from his damn plane.

30:21.636 --> 30:23.904
Maybe he's scared we'll
ship him to The Hague.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.139
Well, he should be.

30:25.140 --> 30:26.407
Let's just hope

30:26.408 --> 30:29.043
that Melnik and the Ukrainians
are ready to play ball.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.544
Don't worry about it.

30:30.545 --> 30:33.414
I'll bash a bat over his head if I have to.

30:37.886 --> 30:39.887
You make contact with Dmitri?

30:39.888 --> 30:41.889
Yup.

30:41.890 --> 30:43.691
Hell of a lot easier than Moscow.

30:43.692 --> 30:45.726
Called his hotel room.

30:45.727 --> 30:47.961
He's waiting for instructions.

30:47.962 --> 30:49.463
Good.

30:49.464 --> 30:51.432
We sit tight till the talks are over,

30:51.433 --> 30:52.900
and then, it's a simple extraction.

30:52.901 --> 30:55.002
He reiterated that he wants
me there at the pickup.

30:55.003 --> 30:57.371
Oh, as long as you're still okay with that.

30:57.372 --> 30:59.373
Just tell me where and when.

30:59.374 --> 31:03.010
We've chosen the corner of Rue
Agasse and Avenue des Jardins.

31:03.011 --> 31:05.245
It's quiet, residential.

31:05.246 --> 31:08.048
Standard procedure is...

31:09.784 --> 31:11.351
There'll be a three-minute window.

31:11.352 --> 31:15.322
If for any reason, he's
not there, we abort.

31:15.323 --> 31:17.457
But I'm not foreseeing any problems.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.593
Good.

31:19.594 --> 31:22.762
Listen...

31:22.763 --> 31:25.198
about going over your head.

31:27.134 --> 31:28.635
- I-I-I wouldn't...
- Oh, you mean, to the, uh,

31:28.636 --> 31:30.136
president of the United
States, your old friend?

31:30.137 --> 31:33.740
Look, if you want to get
into it, that wasn't just

31:33.741 --> 31:35.108
going over my head.

31:35.109 --> 31:37.243
That was pole vaulting the
entire chain of command.

31:37.244 --> 31:39.746
I'm sorry if that made
things difficult for you.

31:39.747 --> 31:41.915
Don't expect a Christmas
card from my supervisors,

31:41.916 --> 31:44.284
but... I get it.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.655
Look, just about everyone
in this line of work

31:48.656 --> 31:51.624
is crystal clear about their patriotism.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.960
At the expense of their humanity sometimes.

31:53.961 --> 31:56.696
And I'd put myself at
the front of that class.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.865
You're different.

31:58.866 --> 32:02.936
I'm not sure if that's a compliment.

32:02.937 --> 32:05.638
Your conscience may not make you

32:05.639 --> 32:07.607
the ideal spy,

32:07.608 --> 32:10.743
but it certainly makes you a better person.

32:10.744 --> 32:13.980
Let's not breathe too easy yet. Uh,

32:13.981 --> 32:16.781
I'll let you know when
we have the green light.

32:17.950 --> 32:19.986
I hear our Ukrainian

32:19.987 --> 32:22.255
friends needed a little hand holding.

32:22.256 --> 32:24.056
Let's just say we took a stroll

32:24.057 --> 32:26.159
through all the possible
outcomes for their country

32:26.160 --> 32:28.027
if they didn't agree to our terms.

32:28.028 --> 32:29.629
Nothing like the threat of annihilation

32:29.630 --> 32:31.397
to make people choose wisely.

32:31.398 --> 32:34.200
Unfortunately, CIA and NSA were unable

32:34.201 --> 32:36.235
to find proof that Maria killed Ostrov.

32:36.236 --> 32:38.604
It's still a compelling
circumstantial case.

32:38.605 --> 32:41.741
Not without the smoking gun.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.176
Shame.

32:44.177 --> 32:46.112
Foreign Minister Melnik, I'm glad Ukraine

32:46.113 --> 32:48.814
and the United States were
able to see eye to eye.

32:48.815 --> 32:50.516
I prefer eye for an eye.

32:50.517 --> 32:53.018
But, yes, we'll sign away
half our beloved country.

32:53.019 --> 32:54.286
Secretary McCord

32:54.287 --> 32:56.554
was quite persuasive.

33:00.759 --> 33:02.728
Good.

33:02.729 --> 33:05.030
Eastern Ukraine will
become an autonomous state

33:05.031 --> 33:07.333
with its borders along
the north of the Black Sea,

33:07.334 --> 33:10.035
from Luhansk to Odessa Oblast.

33:10.036 --> 33:11.770
A puppet of Russia.

33:11.771 --> 33:14.006
An end to all United
States economic sanctions

33:14.007 --> 33:16.575
on the Russian government as
well as on individual Russians.

33:16.576 --> 33:19.244
An end to all travel bans,

33:19.245 --> 33:22.247
except those on the United
States Terrorist Watch List.

33:22.248 --> 33:24.550
Russia agrees to restore
gas and oil supplies

33:24.551 --> 33:26.552
to all European Union countries,

33:26.553 --> 33:28.687
effective immediately
and without interruption

33:28.688 --> 33:32.424
for a minimum of 15 years.

33:32.425 --> 33:34.059
And that's everything.

33:34.060 --> 33:35.627
President Ostrova, I think it's fair

33:35.628 --> 33:37.462
to say that each side has made

33:37.463 --> 33:38.897
painful compromises here.

33:38.898 --> 33:41.066
Now the United States and Ukraine are ready

33:41.067 --> 33:42.534
to sign this agreement.

33:42.535 --> 33:47.104
Russia has one more requirement.

33:50.275 --> 33:52.377
President Ostrova,

33:52.378 --> 33:55.480
the United States stands
firmly behind these terms.

33:55.481 --> 33:56.781
All I require

33:56.782 --> 33:58.717
is truth.

33:58.718 --> 34:01.353
President Dalton, you
must admit to the world

34:01.354 --> 34:03.521
that the United States attacked Moscow's

34:03.522 --> 34:05.156
power grid without provocation.

34:05.157 --> 34:08.324
And apologize.

34:09.594 --> 34:12.063
You know that's never going to happen.

34:12.063 --> 34:15.800
The world's only superpower
prostrates itself to no country.

34:15.801 --> 34:18.937
Now let's sign this deal,
and end the aggression.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.538
I can get

34:20.539 --> 34:22.774
everything I want with aggression,

34:22.775 --> 34:24.676
including all of Ukraine.

34:24.677 --> 34:27.712
Or you can apologize.

34:27.713 --> 34:29.047
It's up to you.

34:29.047 --> 34:30.481
This is what happens

34:30.482 --> 34:32.478
when you try to make a deal with the devil.

34:32.478 --> 34:33.351
Enough.

34:33.351 --> 34:35.851
I'd like the room.

34:37.487 --> 34:39.857
So President Ostrova and I can talk.

34:39.858 --> 34:42.527
Yes, let's talk, President Dalton.

34:42.527 --> 34:45.295
Elizabeth, please stay.

34:52.469 --> 34:55.605
Might be a long flight home.

34:58.743 --> 35:03.481
I think that Afghanistan
and Chechnya are still fresh

35:03.482 --> 35:06.017
on the minds of your
people, President Ostrova.

35:06.018 --> 35:07.718
You underestimate their desire for peace.

35:07.719 --> 35:11.822
You underestimate Russian pride.

35:11.823 --> 35:14.892
After what we all know you did to Moscow,

35:14.893 --> 35:18.195
my people are not afraid of you.

35:18.196 --> 35:20.431
Apologize, or no deal.

35:20.432 --> 35:22.767
I don't take orders from you.

35:22.768 --> 35:25.702
Is okay.

35:26.904 --> 35:30.007
I can go buy new watch
on Rue Du Rhone today.

35:30.008 --> 35:31.242
Good afternoon.

35:31.243 --> 35:33.110
You will sign this deal,

35:33.111 --> 35:36.412
or my government will bury
you and your reputation.

35:37.881 --> 35:40.584
What is this?

35:40.585 --> 35:41.619
A threat?

35:41.620 --> 35:44.187
One you would be wise to heed.

35:50.794 --> 35:53.696
We know you murdered your husband.

36:02.573 --> 36:06.310
We uncovered your relationship
with Dr. Yakov Maklovsky.

36:06.311 --> 36:09.846
We know that he performed
your husband's stomach surgery,

36:09.847 --> 36:11.782
and that his embolism was induced

36:11.783 --> 36:13.850
by an injection of Progestafil.

36:13.851 --> 36:16.286
We know about your
two-million-dollar payments

36:16.287 --> 36:17.688
to Maklovsky.

36:17.689 --> 36:23.126
And we know that you had him
killed to cover your tracks.

36:23.127 --> 36:24.227
This is ridiculous.

36:24.228 --> 36:26.129
And we have proof.

36:26.130 --> 36:30.167
You got where you are by riding
your husband's popularity.

36:30.168 --> 36:31.635
What will happen

36:31.636 --> 36:33.770
when the Russian people
find out that you are guilty

36:33.771 --> 36:36.072
- of murdering their hero?
- What will your generals do?

36:36.073 --> 36:37.474
Your Chief of the General Staff

36:37.475 --> 36:40.910
Doroshevich was your
husband's biggest loyalist.

36:40.911 --> 36:42.946
You'll never survive it politically.

36:42.947 --> 36:47.249
Or... you may simply not survive it.

36:49.185 --> 36:53.056
Like my friend Anton Gorev.

36:53.057 --> 36:55.258
Even if what you say is true,

36:55.259 --> 36:57.560
I cannot go back to my
generals and tell them

36:57.561 --> 37:00.263
I took this deal without
anything in return.

37:00.264 --> 37:03.333
They know I am willing to have war.

37:03.334 --> 37:05.768
Doroshevich wants war.

37:05.769 --> 37:07.237
It is impossible.

37:07.238 --> 37:11.341
You need to find a way to make it possible.

37:11.342 --> 37:15.345
There may be one.

37:15.346 --> 37:17.347
We know that you have a spy in

37:17.348 --> 37:18.948
my inner circle.

37:18.949 --> 37:20.850
If you tell us who that is,

37:20.851 --> 37:23.553
I can take that to the generals,
and we will have a deal.

37:23.554 --> 37:25.955
You've got it wrong.

37:25.956 --> 37:28.825
But even if you were right,

37:28.826 --> 37:33.095
the United States would never
be seen to give up our own asset.

37:33.096 --> 37:34.997
So we would each hold the other's secret.

37:34.998 --> 37:37.900
I will never say publicly
that you agreed to it.

37:37.901 --> 37:40.770
Just like you will never say
what you think I did to Pavel.

37:40.771 --> 37:42.071
Mutually-assured destruction.

37:42.072 --> 37:44.206
Yes, like our Cold War.

37:44.207 --> 37:45.841
It will never happen.

37:45.842 --> 37:48.511
Then I will send my
entire army into Ukraine.

37:48.512 --> 37:52.014
And no matter how many you send
to die, nothing will stop us.

37:52.015 --> 37:54.984
Do you really want to test
the full force of our military?

37:54.985 --> 37:57.286
Because it hasn't gone well for you so far.

37:57.287 --> 37:58.888
My generals want this fight.

37:58.889 --> 38:01.023
And we do not place the same restrictions

38:01.024 --> 38:02.558
on our army as you do.

38:02.559 --> 38:05.361
You mean a nuclear response?

38:05.362 --> 38:08.564
Do you really want to test this?

38:08.565 --> 38:10.832
Conrad?

38:13.902 --> 38:15.137
We can't do this.

38:15.138 --> 38:18.173
We can not do this.

38:18.174 --> 38:19.808
She could be bluffing?

38:19.809 --> 38:22.444
You want to bet a few hundred
thousand lives on that?

38:22.445 --> 38:24.113
- You're right.
- Or millions?

38:24.114 --> 38:25.714
Because that's what
we're talking about here.

38:25.715 --> 38:28.717
I think that we should
consider apologizing.

38:28.718 --> 38:31.186
Roll over for Maria Ostrov
in front of the world?

38:31.187 --> 38:32.488
I think it's an option.

38:32.489 --> 38:35.123
It would be the single greatest
blow to American prestige

38:35.124 --> 38:37.092
since Iraq. It would weaken us,

38:37.093 --> 38:39.061
all while exposing our
classified cyber program.

38:39.062 --> 38:42.164
You built your career
operating in the fog of war.

38:42.165 --> 38:44.232
At CIA, you made nothing but hard choices

38:44.233 --> 38:48.370
about greater good versus individual harm.

38:48.371 --> 38:51.873
Obviously, you're thinking of Henry

38:51.874 --> 38:55.043
and his relationship with the asset.

38:55.044 --> 38:57.045
I'm sorry about that.

38:57.046 --> 39:01.216
But I have to put national security first,

39:01.217 --> 39:04.685
and I need my Secretary
of State in lockstep.

39:14.397 --> 39:16.197
30 seconds. Come on, Hank.

39:16.198 --> 39:18.433
We're good. It's just
right around this corner.

39:19.635 --> 39:21.902
Hello?

39:29.077 --> 39:31.078
There he is.

39:32.380 --> 39:33.548
Copy that. Abort.

39:33.549 --> 39:34.816
- Abort. Abort.
- What? No.

39:34.817 --> 39:37.051
- What? No. Stop the van.
- Can't stop the van.

39:37.052 --> 39:39.287
- Stop the damn van!
- Stand down. Stand down.

39:39.288 --> 39:41.422
Who the hell are those guys?!

39:41.423 --> 39:42.957
I don't know.

39:42.958 --> 39:44.325
- Are they ours?
- I don't know.

39:44.326 --> 39:46.661
Who are those guys? Are they Russians?!

39:46.662 --> 39:48.429
- Did you just give him up?
- Calm down. You are...

39:48.430 --> 39:50.398
- Did we give him up?! What is going on?
- No idea.

39:50.399 --> 39:53.366
I need to know what the hell is going on!

40:04.103 --> 40:07.434
Babe? Oh, thank God you're here. Listen,

40:07.435 --> 40:10.256
they aborted Dmitri's
extraction at the last second,

40:10.257 --> 40:12.224
and I think the Russians got him.

40:12.225 --> 40:13.292
Jane won't tell me anything,

40:13.293 --> 40:16.362
but I am sure that we
can still bring him in.

40:16.363 --> 40:19.765
He's got to be in the city,
so, I need you to call the Swiss

40:19.766 --> 40:21.533
- to ground all Russian planes...
- Henry.

40:21.534 --> 40:23.636
...till we can get into it
with the president. Come on.

40:23.637 --> 40:25.904
I know there's a call that you can make.

40:25.905 --> 40:29.641
He's an American asset,
and he got made somehow.

40:29.642 --> 40:33.212
Or we got cold feet. Anyway,
we can't just give up on him.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.873
We've got to put up a fight.

40:41.053 --> 40:42.788
You know something.

40:42.789 --> 40:45.089
What is it?

40:46.859 --> 40:50.261
It was part of the negotiation.

40:54.032 --> 40:56.333
What?

40:59.705 --> 41:02.407
Dmitri was...?

41:02.408 --> 41:04.242
No, no, no.

41:04.243 --> 41:06.211
That... You...

41:06.212 --> 41:09.047
We would never negotiate
away one of our own assets.

41:09.048 --> 41:10.782
That's not... that's not possible.

41:10.783 --> 41:13.851
Please tell me that's not possible.

41:18.557 --> 41:20.926
Oh, my God.

41:20.927 --> 41:22.694
Oh, my God!

41:22.695 --> 41:25.063
Did Conrad approve this?

41:25.064 --> 41:26.865
Why couldn't you talk him out of it?

41:26.866 --> 41:28.867
He's an old spy, for God's sake.

41:28.868 --> 41:31.528
Why...? How could he do this?

41:35.273 --> 41:37.675
Please tell me you didn't
agree to this, Elizabeth.

41:37.676 --> 41:40.245
We had to think of the greater good.

41:40.246 --> 41:42.046
You know

41:42.047 --> 41:43.948
what they'll do to him.

41:43.949 --> 41:45.750
I'm sorry.

41:45.751 --> 41:47.852
No.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.654
There's got to be another way.

41:49.655 --> 41:50.707
I'm gonna go talk

41:50.708 --> 41:53.009
to Conrad myself.

42:05.422 --> 42:07.683
Elizabeth.

42:07.684 --> 42:09.618
Mr. President.

42:09.619 --> 42:11.153
How's Henry holding up?

42:11.154 --> 42:13.820
Um, he took a commercial flight back.

42:13.821 --> 42:16.823
He made his feelings
known to me last night.

42:16.824 --> 42:18.091
I'm sorry, sir.

42:18.092 --> 42:20.593
That couldn't have been fun.

42:20.594 --> 42:23.328
You will both regret this.

42:25.698 --> 42:29.401
Well, at least they're consistent.

42:36.976 --> 42:40.080
I do not disagree with a
single thing that Henry said.

42:40.081 --> 42:42.182
If you had told me ten years ago

42:42.183 --> 42:44.616
that I would have made that call...

42:52.292 --> 42:55.795
Some partners in peace.

42:55.796 --> 42:59.132
Sir, I just need to make a quick
phone call if that's all right?

42:59.133 --> 43:01.433
- I'll catch up.
- Of course.

43:06.205 --> 43:07.740
Hi. You've reached Henry McCord.

43:07.741 --> 43:09.342
Please leave me a message.

43:09.343 --> 43:11.344
Hey, baby. It's me.

43:11.345 --> 43:15.982
Just checking in again.
I left you a message.

43:15.983 --> 43:17.950
Call me, please?

43:17.951 --> 43:23.288
I love you.
