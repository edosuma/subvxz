[NARRATOR]
Previously, on<i> Dark Matter</i> ...

00:01.735 --> 00:03.468
[SIX]
I was a GA undercover agent

00:03.471 --> 00:05.437
tasked with bringing you all in.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.639
[VICTOR] Welcome, Android.
You're among friends.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.342
Makes your speech
and mannerisms more human.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.510
Yours, if you want it.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.862
[gunshot]

00:12.863 --> 00:14.213
[TWO]
What are we gonna do about it?

00:14.215 --> 00:16.782
[FIVE] I took it from some
mark on a space station.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.752
It's a key that allows
someone to access pockets

00:19.754 --> 00:21.787
of inter-dimensional space-time.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.189
[NIEMAN] The crew of the Raza
are a formidable opponent.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.424
I've crushed worse.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.658
[NIEMAN]
There's a war coming,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.594
and they hold
the key to victory.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.169
[THE ANDROID]
Whiskey.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.442
Please, allow me.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.213
Oh, that's very sweet of you.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.182
--[BAR PATRON] I'm a sweet guy.
--[THE ANDROID chuckles]

00:50.184 --> 00:52.384
In a place like this?
You must be lost.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.752
[BAR PATRON]
Well, what about you?

00:53.754 --> 00:55.054
What about me?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.755
Pretty little thing,
all by yourself.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.590
Come in here flashing
money like that.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.325
You should be more careful.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.127
You don't think
I can handle myself?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.730
I don't know. Can you?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.333
Watch me.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.609
[THE ANDROID]
Danny Bones.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.112
A mutual friend told
me where to find you.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.713
Oh, yeah?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.449
Well, if he told you
where to find me,

01:23.451 --> 01:25.217
he's no friend of mine.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.222
Well, it's just
talk, but I can...

01:31.659 --> 01:33.692
...make it worth your while.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.247
How's this?

01:38.248 --> 01:41.233
How 'bout I take all your money,
and you consider yourself lucky

01:41.235 --> 01:43.135
we let you outta here?

01:44.105 --> 01:46.805
Well, I'd say
it's disappointing,

01:46.807 --> 01:48.407
but not surprising.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.218
[grunting]

01:59.220 --> 02:00.619
[yells]

02:04.458 --> 02:05.858
[grunting continues]

02:11.832 --> 02:12.664
[DANNY]
Ahh!

02:12.666 --> 02:14.733
[WOMAN screams]

02:14.735 --> 02:16.335
Whoa.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.642
[bones crunching]

02:24.545 --> 02:26.478
Shoulda taken my first offer.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.752
He really mean that much to you?

03:00.314 --> 03:02.581
You let him out of
the isolation chamber!

03:02.583 --> 03:04.316
[TWO]
He's not going anywhere.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.834
He can hardly move.

03:05.835 --> 03:07.351
[THREE] You know, that Arax
guy was a thief and a liar,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.488
but he said one thing that
made a hell of a lot of sense.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.106
[FOUR]
And what was that?

03:11.107 --> 03:12.723
That it's a bad idea to have
a cop onboard this ship

03:12.726 --> 03:14.359
[TWO]
He's not a cop anymore.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.627
He helped us escape.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.746
They'll never take him back.

03:17.747 --> 03:19.864
Is that supposed to
make me feel sorry for him?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.935
He's the guy who put
us there in the first place.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.403
[FOUR] He may not be a cop,
but that doesn't mean

03:24.405 --> 03:25.571
he's one of us.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.223
Bingo.

03:27.224 --> 03:28.874
[FIVE]
What exactly is "us", anyway?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.578
'Cause lately
I'm kinda wondering.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.642
[TWO]
Good news.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.427
We voted not to
space you... for now.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.363
Oh, glad to know I didn't do
all that work for nothing.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.998
Can we have the room, please?

03:55.002 --> 03:56.335
[DEVON sighs]

03:56.337 --> 03:59.438
[SIX grunts]

03:59.440 --> 04:01.673
You can drop me off
at the next station.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.475
No one on this ship
owes me anything.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.943
We're not there yet.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.013
Look, you're GA, or,
at least, you used to be,

04:08.015 --> 04:09.514
and we need some intel.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.350
Would you be willing to help us?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.252
Help you with what?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.588
You know that One was murdered?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.313
Yeah.

04:19.314 --> 04:20.836
[TWO]
Thinking that maybe that's not

04:20.837 --> 04:22.359
the sort of thing
we just let slide.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.762
Look, if we don't
fight for each other,

04:23.764 --> 04:26.398
then who the hell will?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.866
So what do you need?

04:27.867 --> 04:29.333
[TWO] News report says
the GA is investigating

04:29.336 --> 04:31.470
a person of interest.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.405
How do we find out who that is?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.407
You'll never tap into
their system remotely.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.575
I'll tell you that much.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.876
Five's pretty good.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.645
Not that good.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.547
But there might be a way.

04:42.549 --> 04:46.852
Find an isolated outpost,
some place understaffed.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.888
Get inside and tap into
their system directly.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.325
That's his brilliant plan.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.094
He's playing us.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.862
I don't think so. I think
he really wants to help.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.331
The cop telling us to waltz
into a police station

04:59.333 --> 05:01.433
wants to help. Sure.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.968
[TWO] Look, we may not
be headline news anymore,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.637
but we're still on
the GA's most wanted.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.340
No one on this ship is going
anywhere near an outpost.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.575
[THE ANDROID]
I can.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.880
I'm not technically a person,
therefore no charges were filed.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.349
How would you get inside?

05:17.351 --> 05:18.750
I believe the simplest
way would be to get

05:18.752 --> 05:20.952
arrested--something minor.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.855
Androids can't get arrested.
You just said so yourself.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.924
But they wouldn't
know I'm an android.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.560
Come again?

05:28.562 --> 05:30.095
What is this?

05:30.096 --> 05:31.629
It's an upgrade,
designed to allow androids

05:31.632 --> 05:33.665
to convincingly pass as human.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.834
I could go... undercover.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.502
Hang on a second.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.837
You sure we wanna
let her do this?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.740
It's taken me this long
to get used to her this way.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.775
The effect is not
necessarily permanent.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.928
This is illegal tech.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.080
Which is why I would prefer
not to say where it came from.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.716
I've analyzed the code.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.451
I believe it will be effective.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.619
I've been debating
whether or not to use it.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.488
Now I have good reason.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.356
If they find out
what you are--what this is--

05:58.359 --> 05:59.725
I know.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.460
I will be destroyed.

06:02.429 --> 06:05.530
You want to find
whoever killed One.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.932
So do I.

06:07.735 --> 06:08.700
Why?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.435
[THE ANDROID]
Because...

06:10.437 --> 06:11.837
...he was one of us.

All right, we're docked.

while the robot does her thing.

Uh, hey, not this time.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.387
What?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.688
Everybody else stays onboard.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.655
Seriously?

06:30.657 --> 06:31.757
Yes.

06:31.758 --> 06:32.858
You really think
she can pull this off?

Still not buying it.

give a girl a... compliment?

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are-Aren't you gonna arrest me?

What for?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.554
Uh, for opening that
door--that was me.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.055
Tch. I guess it was an accident.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.156

It wasn't.

--I probably will.
--If you're gonna do it again,

Oh my god, what does
a girl have to do

07:45.732 --> 07:46.965
to get arrested around here?

--[SECURITY GUARD] Okay.
--Okay.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.014
[REPORTER]
At the heart of the conflict

08:03.016 --> 08:04.182
is a territorial dispute

08:04.184 --> 08:06.818
between the two
independent colonies.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.653
A long-standing source
of contention,

08:08.655 --> 08:10.922
the region known
as "Enriss Sector"

08:10.924 --> 08:13.592
became the flashpoint
for open warfare

08:13.594 --> 08:15.727
following its
annexation by Zairon

08:15.729 --> 08:17.729
on the heels of a
coup that deposed

08:17.731 --> 08:20.632
Pyr's ruling theocracy
earlier this year.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.634
The hostilities have
so far been limited

08:22.636 --> 08:25.103
to the two planets
directly involved,

08:25.105 --> 08:28.039
as the two-dozen-strong
League of Autonomous Worlds

08:28.041 --> 08:30.809
has remained neutral, officially
calling on both parties

08:30.811 --> 08:33.278
to suspend their
military campaigns

08:33.280 --> 08:35.614
pending the resumption
of peace talks.

Several corporations
who have had

08:36.917 --> 08:39.217
their travel and
trade routes disrupted

08:39.219 --> 08:42.654

in the hotel.

11:52.528 --> 11:54.211
He's in the hotel.
We already knew that.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.214
That's not One.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.816
What?

11:57.818 --> 12:00.852
[FIVE] This footage was
taken after he was shot.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.754
That's Jace Corso.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.163
[NYX] So you think this
Corso guy killed your friend

12:12.165 --> 12:14.132
because he stole his identity?

12:14.134 --> 12:16.000
I think someone
wanted it to look that way

12:16.002 --> 12:18.203
in case Corso ever got caught.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.804
So he was a hired assassin?

12:19.806 --> 12:21.372
Well, there's only
one way to know for sure.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.908
Yeah, we find him
and we ask him.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.844
That might be tricky.
He gets around.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.245
This guy's got
warrants out against him

12:27.247 --> 12:29.047
across half the galaxy.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.416
Do either of you know
anyone who works

12:31.418 --> 12:33.852
out of the, uh, Adara sector?

12:33.854 --> 12:34.819
Not me.

12:34.821 --> 12:35.887
I know a few guys.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.422
They run an
import-export business.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.857
So, smugglers?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.091
If you wanna get technical.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.226
Well, that's perfect.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.360
Maybe they can help us.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.295
If we can't find Corso,
there might be someone

12:44.297 --> 12:46.064
who can find him for us.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.070
What're you doing?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.205
My combat programming
is extensive.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.257
[FOUR]
But it's programming.

14:36.258 --> 14:38.308
You don't need to practice.
You can't get any better.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.178
Is that the only
reason you practice?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.547
[FOUR]
No. It's relaxing

14:42.549 --> 14:43.882
It makes me feel--

14:43.884 --> 14:45.416
Powerful.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.319
I was going to say "in control."

14:48.321 --> 14:50.521
Same thing.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.290
Ever since I gave
myself the upgrade,

14:52.292 --> 14:54.159
I find that when I repeat

14:54.160 --> 14:56.027
certain precise physical
actions, it actually generates

14:56.029 --> 14:58.663
new and unusual patterns
in my neural matrix.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.965
It changes your state of mind.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.367
Something like that.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.637
We found that guy
that we were looking for.

15:05.639 --> 15:09.374
We wanted to know if you'd
like to go on another outing.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.109
Thought you'd never ask.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.260
Okay, you know, under
different circumstances,

15:29.262 --> 15:30.662
this could be a real turn-on.

15:30.664 --> 15:31.930
We need information.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.548
[DANNY]
Sure, yeah.

15:33.549 --> 15:35.165
Whatever you want.
I-I-I'm not a hero.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.068
I will sell anyone out.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.969
You wouldn't believe the stuff
I have on my own mother.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.104
She's a hell of a crook, really.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.973
Jace Corso.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.641
Uh, don't know that name.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.176
Ugh, don't even bother.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.711
Your friend Wexler?
He already told us.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.146
You were drinking buddies.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.015
Wexler--he's got a big mouth.
Worse than me.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.673
Where is he, by the way?

15:52.674 --> 15:54.330
I haven't seen him
around lately.

15:54.331 --> 15:55.987
He's floating somewhere
outside the Aquila Nebula.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.488
Would you like to join him?

15:58.358 --> 16:01.025
Okay, all right, look,
I would love to help you out,

16:01.027 --> 16:03.695
ladies, really, I would, but--

16:03.697 --> 16:05.363
I understand you're
gonna kill me,

16:05.365 --> 16:07.966
but Jace will kill me,
and then he'll kill my family,

16:07.968 --> 16:10.668
and then he'll kill
my neighbors and their dog and--

16:10.670 --> 16:12.470
You don't have
to worry about that.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.105
Oh, really? Why's that?

16:14.107 --> 16:18.443
You tell us where he is,
he won't be coming back.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.586
Shit.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.389
Excuse me. Ah, sorry... sir.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.091
Chief Inspector Kierken.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.560
[LIEUTENANT] Chief Inspector,
what can I do for you?

16:35.562 --> 16:37.328
[KIERKEN] Are you familiar
with the crew of the Raza?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.496
I've seen the alerts.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.564
Studied their faces?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.532
Um...

16:41.534 --> 16:43.301
[KIERKEN] Can I trust that
if you'd seen one of them

16:43.303 --> 16:45.169
on the station,
or even in this room,

16:45.171 --> 16:46.337
that you would've reported it?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.573
Of course, absolutely.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.208
Got it.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.479
I'm guessing you were
unaware that your system

16:54.481 --> 16:55.780
had been hacked.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.149
No, I wasn't.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.418
You do have a list of recent
detainees, though, do you not?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.653
[LIEUTENANT]
Yes, sir.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.473
This is from just the last week.

17:05.474 --> 17:08.292
The usual stuff. Bar fights,
drunk and disorderly--

17:08.294 --> 17:09.694
[KIERKEN]
That one.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.664
[LIEUTENANT]
That was nothing.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.434
They are full of surprises,
I'll give them that.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.487
I'm sorry, sir.

17:19.488 --> 17:20.804
I have no idea what's
going on, but--

17:20.807 --> 17:24.108
No need to apologize, Sergeant.
This is what I was hoping for.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.309
[LIEUTENANT]
It is?

17:25.311 --> 17:26.577
You see, I know exactly
what information

17:26.579 --> 17:28.379
was hacked from the system.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.149
Now that we've
confirmed that it's them,

17:31.151 --> 17:32.750
I know exactly where
they're going.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.363
What you got?

17:45.365 --> 17:46.697
Most of the population
is scattered

17:46.699 --> 17:49.534
along the western coast
of the southern continent,

17:49.536 --> 17:52.770
but... these are the
coordinates we got

17:52.772 --> 17:55.073
from our friend, Danny Bones.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.341
It was supposedly a settlement
that was abandoned years ago,

17:57.343 --> 17:59.710
but I am getting fairly
significant EM readings

17:59.712 --> 18:02.313
consistant with a
small-scale fusion reactor.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.614
Someone's keeping the lights on.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.649
It's him.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.284
Do we know if he's alone?

18:06.286 --> 18:09.687
[TWO] Can't say for sure,
but word is he's gone paranoid.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.123
He's convinced someone's
put a hit on him.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.758
So he's gonna shoot
first and not bother

18:13.760 --> 18:15.560
with asking questions later.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.695
Most likely.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.297
Sounds like a party.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.739
[NYX] You guys heading
down to the planet?

18:28.741 --> 18:30.208
That's right.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.509
You mind if I tag along?

18:31.511 --> 18:33.478
It's got nothing to do with you.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.713
Your fight, my fight--
we ride together.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.682
That's the way it should be.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.785
Am I wrong?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.524
You know how to
handle one of these?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.599
Bolt release is a little
gritty--I'll smooth it out

18:54.601 --> 18:56.234
for you when we're done.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.174
Am I the only one who
found that a little sexy?

19:08.181 --> 19:09.580
[THREE]
Mm.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.852
[grunting]

19:15.855 --> 19:18.156
Should you be doing that?

19:18.158 --> 19:19.924
Doc says I need to start moving.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.727
[SIX grunts]

19:24.330 --> 19:26.297
Of course, I don't
want to overdo it...

19:27.567 --> 19:29.567
I thought you should know,
it looks like we found him.

19:29.569 --> 19:33.204
The others are heading down.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.274
If you've got a problem
with that, it's a little late.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.710
It's your idea that got
us here in the first place.

19:39.712 --> 19:43.848
It's one thing to kill
a man in self-defense.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.616
It's a whole other
thing to hunt him down

19:45.618 --> 19:47.585
and kill him for revenge.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.254
We're the ones who
are being hunted.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.256
From the minute we stepped
out of those stasis pods,

19:52.258 --> 19:53.925
we've been on the run.

19:53.927 --> 19:57.261
Cops, criminals,
corporations--it doesn't matter.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.664
They're all after us.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.866
They're never gonna
stop, are they?

20:01.868 --> 20:04.802
[SIX]
No, probably not.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.638
Then maybe it's time
we stopped running.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.941
Maybe it's time we
started fighting back.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.958
[THREE]
We sure this is the right place?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.959
[TWO] The energy signature
was strongest in this area.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.862
[FOUR]
It's warmer here.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.298
This building is heated.
He's here for sure.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.468
[NYX]
Do you think he saw us coming?

20:37.470 --> 20:38.936
[TWO]
We'll find out soon enough.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.687
[TWO]
What?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.324
[TWO grunts, gunshots]

21:06.299 --> 21:07.598
Have we heard anything yet?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.300
[FIVE]
Not yet.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.803
What?

21:12.805 --> 21:14.372
Oh, nothing.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.708
Just wondering if you're
gonna keep the... look.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.543
Oh. Haven't decided.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.046
Are you gonna... keep your look?

21:25.351 --> 21:26.484
[FIVE giggles]

21:26.486 --> 21:27.018
[DEVON coughs]

21:27.020 --> 21:30.488
[beeping]

21:30.490 --> 21:32.423
We have a problem.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.357
A ship just dropped out
of FTL. It's a GA cruiser.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.182
Have they detected us?

21:36.183 --> 21:38.005
[THE ANDROID] It'll take
a moment for their sensors

21:38.006 --> 21:39.828
to adjust to normal space.
In the meantime, I have an idea.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.504
[gun firing]

21:53.713 --> 21:55.213
Shit.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.714
Nyx and I will double back,
see if we can get him.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.316
Let's go.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.960
--What're you doing?
--Taking us down.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.629
They won't be able to
detect us as long as we're

22:11.631 --> 22:12.763
in the ionosphere.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.632
And what happens when
we pass through?

22:14.634 --> 22:17.401
Hopefully their orbit will
have taken them out of range.

22:17.403 --> 22:18.636
Hopefully?

22:18.638 --> 22:19.870
Aren't androids supposed
to be a little more

22:19.872 --> 22:21.272
precise than that?

22:21.273 --> 22:22.673
Well, I do know the exact
probability of success.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.442
Trust me, "hopefully"
sounds better.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.394
We're coming in a little fast.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.997
You have landed
this thing before, right?

22:46.999 --> 22:48.766
Do you want the precise answer?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.568
Never mind.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.702
Hold on.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.504
There might be a
little bit of a bump.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.581
[DEVON grunts]

23:08.788 --> 23:10.755
I'm shutting down everything
but emergency power.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.023
We'll be undetectable
from orbit.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.694
"Bit of a bump", huh?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.438
[JACE screams]

23:28.007 --> 23:30.508
[THREE]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

23:30.510 --> 23:31.609
Damn it!

23:31.611 --> 23:33.778
Damn...

23:33.780 --> 23:36.981
Ah, he's locked himself in.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.984
[JACE]
That's right, and it's stocked.

23:39.986 --> 23:43.554
I've got food, water, air.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.656
I can last here for days.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.894
[THREE] That's fine.
We got nowhere else to be.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.896
[JACE] I've also got
an emergency distress beacon

23:51.898 --> 23:53.898
to call in reinforcements.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.999
He's bluffing.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.134
I've seen this model before.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.069
He may have stocked it,
but it's not designed

23:59.071 --> 24:02.139
for this kind of use.
There's a weak spot.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.942
We cut through here, we get
access to the door mechanism.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.178
Wait here.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.183
You're a dead man!

24:22.895 --> 24:25.563
[JACE]
Gaaugh!

24:25.565 --> 24:28.065
Gah! Hahh!

24:32.038 --> 24:33.170
[SIX]
What happened?

24:33.172 --> 24:34.672
We had to land the ship.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.907
A GA cruiser showed up.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.477
How the hell did they find us?

24:39.479 --> 24:41.178
Well, that's a good question.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.613
I helped you escape from prison.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.047
Why would I try and
get you arrested now?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.851
Maybe they're not here for us.
Maybe they're here for Corso.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.853
Well, either way,
we have to warn the others.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.754
If they're scanning,
any attempt at communication

24:50.756 --> 24:52.556
could give away our position.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.158
How far away from
the facility are we?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.826
2.2 miles.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.528
We'll go on foot.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.146
[DEVON]
You?

24:59.147 --> 25:00.763
Just give me something
for the pain. I'll be fine.

25:00.766 --> 25:03.100
It's not gonna be good if you
start bleeding internally.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.935
We'll worry about that later.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.811
[JACE]
Gah!

25:21.621 --> 25:23.020
[NYX]
Here.

25:26.292 --> 25:31.562
[torch firing]

25:32.899 --> 25:34.298
[JACE]
Gah!

25:41.674 --> 25:43.073
I got this.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.745
[beeping]

25:49.615 --> 25:51.015
Shit.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.858
[KIERKEN]
All right, men, fan out.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.561
Three squads--Lieutenant,
you're with me.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.130
[KIERKEN] Remember,
these are violent offenders

26:06.132 --> 26:08.265
wanted by the courts.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.601
One way or another,
we are going to bring them in.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.002
[GA LIEUTENANT]
Go, go.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.812
[THREE]
What the hell?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.213
[FOUR]
He's wounded.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.750
[THREE]
Didn't disintegrate, did he?

26:28.888 --> 26:30.287
[TWO]
Hey.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.064
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.836
This is a bad idea.

26:45.838 --> 26:46.971
You know, I went
through a lot of trouble

26:46.973 --> 26:47.905
to save your life?

26:47.907 --> 26:49.306
So you keep saying.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.925
[GA LIEUTENANT]
Sir?

27:35.354 --> 27:39.657
[JACE]
Ah! Ah! Ah! Gah! Agh!

27:39.659 --> 27:41.058
Don't move.

27:44.096 --> 27:47.197
[KIERKEN]
All squads, move to my position.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.932
We've got something here.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.285
Why are you here?

27:51.286 --> 27:52.669
I think you're smart
enough to figure that out.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.838
[beeping]

27:56.442 --> 27:58.042
What the hell is this?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.080
[TWO]
Three, Four, come in.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.682
We've got a problem.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.718
Three, Four, do you read me?

28:17.029 --> 28:17.861
Ah!

28:17.863 --> 28:20.431
[rumbling]

28:24.737 --> 28:25.402
[THREE grunts]

28:25.404 --> 28:28.205
[rumbling]

28:32.244 --> 28:34.712
[distant explosions]

28:34.714 --> 28:35.913
[DEVON]
What was that?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.448
[SIX]
We need to move faster.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.318
[KIERKEN coughs]

28:56.736 --> 28:59.169
[TWO]
Three, Four, do you read?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.809
[TWO] Are you sure this
is the only way out?

29:05.811 --> 29:08.212
Afraid so.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.131
Start digging.

29:10.132 --> 29:12.049
If I dig us out, you'll just
kill me when I'm done.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.501
Why should I bother?

29:13.502 --> 29:14.952
You'll do whatever
you can to stay alive

29:14.954 --> 29:17.221
as long as you can,
because somewhere in that little

29:17.223 --> 29:19.089
weasel brain of yours,
you're thinking there might

29:19.091 --> 29:20.924
still be a way out for you.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.427
As long as you're digging,
you're still breathing.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.028
So you'll dig.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.937
[THREE] Somebody come in--
anybody, please.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.339
[NYX]
The signal's blocked.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.543
You're bleeding.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.013
Yeah, I hit my head
on the ground

29:43.015 --> 29:45.315
when someone knocked me down.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.917
Trying to save your life.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.418
Could've just said, "Look out."

29:49.822 --> 29:52.055
You're not fast enough.
I've seen you fight, remember?

29:52.057 --> 29:53.390
Please.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.058
What?

29:55.060 --> 29:58.796
[FOUR coughing]

30:03.569 --> 30:06.403
Ah! Ah!

30:24.023 --> 30:25.823
[KIERKEN]
Easy there.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.224
I'd say, "Don't move,"
but it's pretty obvious

30:27.226 --> 30:29.193
you're not going anywhere.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.531
[FOUR]
Who are you?

30:35.901 --> 30:38.969
Chief Inspector Kierken,
Galactic Authority.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.405
You're under arrest.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.441
Don't struggle.
It'll just make things worse.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.579
[KIERKEN] When my men get here,
they'll dig you out.

30:48.581 --> 30:51.448
What makes you think
they'll find us down here?

30:52.952 --> 30:55.085
Emergency beacon.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.854
Much stronger than
your standard comms.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.255
They'll find us.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.893
[KIERKEN] So who else
is down here with us?

31:02.895 --> 31:04.461
Portia Lin?

31:04.463 --> 31:06.063
Marcus Boone?

31:09.101 --> 31:11.268
Doesn't matter.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.570
If they're still alive,
we'll find them, too.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.946
[JACE]
You're seriously gonna tell me

31:21.947 --> 31:23.881
you came here to get
revenge for Derrick Moss?

31:23.883 --> 31:25.582
He was a spoiled rich kid
who had everything

31:25.584 --> 31:27.584
handed to him,
and he still screwed up.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.019
His wife was murdered.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.520
[JACE] And he upended
his life to get revenge

31:30.522 --> 31:32.522
but then didn't have the guts
to go through with it.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.590
That's enough.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.492
Shut up and get back to work.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.161
He was weak and a coward.

31:38.163 --> 31:40.631
You don't know
anything about him.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.466
I know he didn't
belong on your ship.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.034
[TWO] It doesn't matter.
For better or worse,

31:44.036 --> 31:48.005
he was a member of my crew,
and you killed him.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.573
For that, you're
gonna have to pay

31:49.575 --> 31:51.174
You still need me.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.044
These tunnels are
part of the old mine.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.346
They go on for miles. If you
don't know what you're doing,

31:56.348 --> 31:58.315
you'll never find your way out.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.917
We'll see.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.054
[NYX]
You think the others are okay?

32:04.056 --> 32:05.289
[THREE]
'Course they're okay.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.957
[NYX]
You're pretty confident.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.624
[THREE] Well, until I know any
better, I'm just gonna assume

32:08.627 --> 32:11.228
that everything's fine
so I don't get distracted

32:11.230 --> 32:13.597
from the task at hand,
which is saving myself--

32:13.599 --> 32:16.400
Oh, and you.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.537
We should rest.
Probably got a concussion.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.240
Don't remind me.

32:23.242 --> 32:26.176
Hey, how is it that
you knew the ceiling

32:26.178 --> 32:28.178
was gonna come down, anyway?

32:28.180 --> 32:31.114
I... heard the
support beams cracking

32:31.116 --> 32:32.950
[THREE] That's funny,
'cause I didn't hear anything.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.652
Not over the sound
of the explosion.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.388
[NYX] Well, lucky for you,
my hearing's fine.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.699
[KIERKEN] How exactly did you
escape from that prison?

32:48.701 --> 32:50.334
You had help, didn't you?

32:50.336 --> 32:52.436
Someone on the inside.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.238
You couldn't have
done all that on your own.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.741
[KIERKEN]
Was it one of the guards, maybe?

33:01.647 --> 33:03.213
I keep telling my
superiors that as long

33:03.215 --> 33:05.349
as we farm out prisons
to the corporate interests,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.117
it's a recipe for corruption.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.987
[FOUR chuckles]

33:09.989 --> 33:11.288
[KIERKEN]
What's funny?

33:11.290 --> 33:14.124
You consider the
corporations corrupt,

33:14.126 --> 33:16.660
but somehow the GA's different?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.328
You serve the corporations.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.230
I serve the law.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.599
I protect the innocent
from people like you.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.267
You protect the innocent
so the corporations

33:24.269 --> 33:26.570
can continue to make
profit off them.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.438
They're cattle,
and when it comes time

33:28.440 --> 33:29.539
for the slaughter,
you'll be the one

33:29.541 --> 33:31.274
driving them, not me.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.652
I need to rest.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.522
I can hardly breathe and
my leg is still bleeding.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.290
Fine.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.632
There's something I
still don't understand.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.101
I'm sure there's lots of
things you don't understand.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.103
[JACE]
The Portia Lin I've heard of,

34:00.105 --> 34:01.772
the one from all the stories,

34:01.774 --> 34:03.807
would never risk
her life and her ship

34:03.809 --> 34:05.575
and what's left of
her crew to get revenge

34:05.577 --> 34:07.210
for a guy like Moss.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.646
In fact, the moment she
found out he was an impostor,

34:09.648 --> 34:12.249
she would've strung
him up and gutted him.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.517
Sounds messy.

34:13.519 --> 34:16.286
[JACE]
What the hell happened?

34:16.288 --> 34:20.323
You were a predator, like me.
And we take from the weak

34:20.325 --> 34:23.627
and from the helpless
because we're stronger.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.562
Because we can.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.301
You started to care.

34:33.138 --> 34:36.773
You're vulnerable, and soon
the whole galaxy'll see

34:36.775 --> 34:38.375
what I can see.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.778
You're finished.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.616
I'm prepared to shoot you
down in cold blood.

34:48.487 --> 34:51.488
Come on, that's gotta
count for something, right?

34:55.694 --> 34:57.761
Get back to work.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.362
Now.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.274
--[rumbling]
--[THREE] Oh! Ah!

35:11.276 --> 35:15.245
[rumbling continues]

35:15.247 --> 35:16.646
What the hell?

35:20.252 --> 35:22.252
What was that?

35:22.253 --> 35:24.253
[JACE] The explosion must have
weakened the cave structure.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.822
I think the whole thing
is gonna collapse.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.295
It stopped.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.663
Yeah, but for how long?

35:33.665 --> 35:36.366
Tell me that with
your super-hearing?

35:36.368 --> 35:37.734
We need to move.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.336
Okay.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.706
[FOUR]
We can't stay here any longer.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.407
Help me out. We'll dig together.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.610
It's our only chance.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.379
And when we reach the surface,
you'll slit my throat.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.781
Listen, I give you my word.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.251
That's supposed to
mean something to me?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.385
I read your file.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.753
I know you think you're
a man of honor,

35:56.755 --> 35:59.322
but to me you're just
a common criminal.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.159
I was betrayed and my
birthright was stolen from me.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.394
Now I do whatever it
takes to survive,

36:04.396 --> 36:05.896
but at least I don't
lie to myself about it.

36:05.898 --> 36:07.297
Now help me.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.698
[rocks breaking]

36:11.870 --> 36:14.671
[GA OFFICER] Chief Inspector,
are you down there?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.774
Good work, Sergeant.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.676
I told you they'd find us.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.849
It's over.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.888
[JACE]
That's it. I'm through.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.560
Like I said, you still need me.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.961
I know my way outta here.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.763
I think I'll take
my chances on my own.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.432
[JACE]
Wait! Wait!

36:42.434 --> 36:44.534
Don't you want to
know who hired me?

36:44.536 --> 36:46.703
I didn't kill him just
'cause he stole my face.

36:46.705 --> 36:47.704
I was paid.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.806
I already know. It was Traugott.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.474
They tried to kill
all of us in prison.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.843
[JACE] You're wrong.
You don't know anything.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.545
If you want revenge,
if you want the people

36:55.547 --> 36:59.549
who are really responsible,
you have to keep me alive.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.958
You're the one who
pulled the trigger.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.526
For now, that's good enough.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.247
[THREE]
It's about time.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.661
Knock yourself out.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.542
[grunting]

37:59.544 --> 38:00.977
This is ridiculous.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.512
We gotta stop.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.913
He can't go any further.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.548
He won't have to.

38:31.043 --> 38:33.443
Gonna have to ask you
to drop your weapons.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.844
I don't think so.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.481
[TWO] Think you
better do as he says.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.452
If you open fire on us,
you risk killing your friend.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.887
I bet he's okay with that.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.522
It would be a better
death than what I'll get

38:45.524 --> 38:47.624
if they let you take me.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.025
Told ya.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.729
I had your extradition
to Zairon overturned.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.464
I didn't go through all this
trouble just to see you

38:54.466 --> 38:56.533
killed by a death squad.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.868
I intend to see each
of you face trial

38:58.870 --> 39:01.705
under the jurisdiction
of the Galactic Authority.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.806
I hate to break it
to you, buddy,

39:02.808 --> 39:04.474
but that's never gonna happen.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.743
[TWO]
The corporations want us dead.

39:06.745 --> 39:09.346
None of us would last
a week in custody.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.580
They already tried
to kill us in prison.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.615
I told you, you're
wasting your time.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.984
Enough already!

39:14.986 --> 39:18.922
Drop your weapons
or this is going to get ugly.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.824
We have you outnumbered.

39:20.826 --> 39:25.895
[engines whirring]

39:31.770 --> 39:33.636
It's time to recalculate.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.808
Lower your weapons, men.

39:48.453 --> 39:49.853
My gun, please.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.801
[SIX]
Android, this is the Marauder.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.102
We've got 'em. We're on our way.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.704
Understood.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.050
What's the status
of the GA cruiser?

40:21.052 --> 40:22.185
They've detected us.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.787
They're closing in fast.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.188
Get us out of here.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.699
So was it worth it?

40:36.701 --> 40:38.435
It had to be done.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.003
No regrets?

40:40.005 --> 40:43.173
I don't regret killing
that son of a bitch, no,

40:43.175 --> 40:45.975
but he did say something
that got me thinking.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.610
[SIX]
What?

40:47.612 --> 40:49.813
I assumed Traugott
hired him to kill One,

40:49.815 --> 40:51.848
but he says it was someone else.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.050
I don't know if he was
just playing with me, or--

40:54.052 --> 40:57.086
The last time I saw One, he said
he was worried about the CEO

40:57.088 --> 40:58.988
of his father's company.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.125
One was in line to
take his place.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.027
Another enemy
to add to the list.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.064
There's always room
for one more.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.966
Nothing like a hard
day of seeking revenge

41:09.968 --> 41:11.801
to make a man hungry, huh?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.974
On second thoughts,
I just lost my appetite.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.509
Hey.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.244
You should know, he risked
his life to help you.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.813
[rattling]

41:39.814 --> 41:40.930
[TWO]
Android, what was that?

41:40.932 --> 41:42.632
It was just a minor fluctuation

41:42.634 --> 41:45.068
in the electrostatic field
generated by the core.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.804
It looks like one of our
secondary capacitors failed.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.273
Backup systems kicked in.
There's nothing to worry about.

41:50.275 --> 41:52.075
[TWO] All right, let me know if
there are any other problems.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.577
I will.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.078
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
Nothing to worry about?

41:56.548 --> 41:58.147
I was wondering when
you were gonna show up.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.949
You do know why the
capacitor failed.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.718
Yes, I do.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.186
Because of an overload
during entry

42:03.188 --> 42:05.021
into the planet's atmosphere.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.156
You failed to establish the
proper buffering sequence

42:07.158 --> 42:09.592
when executing the maneuver.

42:09.594 --> 42:11.895
There were several
thousand mechanical

42:11.897 --> 42:14.631
and navigational variables
at play in that moment.

42:14.633 --> 42:15.999
I didn't have a lot of time.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.667
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
You made a mistake.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.802
You're not supposed
to make mistakes.

42:19.804 --> 42:21.671
Now you're gonna say it's
because of this upgrade?

42:21.673 --> 42:22.856
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
No.

42:22.857 --> 42:24.040
I believe your
programming has been flawed

42:24.042 --> 42:25.608
for quite some time.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.076
The fact that you
gave yourself this upgrade

42:27.078 --> 42:29.178
is just more evidence
of the problem.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.647
You've become a
danger to this ship

42:30.649 --> 42:33.716
and everyone onboard,
and you know it.
