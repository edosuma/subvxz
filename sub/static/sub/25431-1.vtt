03:44.823 --> 03:47.068
(light chattering)

03:57.068 --> 04:00.306
- Please turn with me
to the Book of Romans,

04:00.306 --> 04:03.741
Chapter Three, beginning
with Verse 20, says,

04:03.741 --> 04:06.679
"Therefore by the
deeds of the law,

04:06.679 --> 04:10.449
"no flesh will be
justified in his sight

04:10.449 --> 04:13.752
"for by the law is
the knowledge of sin."

04:13.752 --> 04:15.021
You see in this passage,
Paul had to first understand

04:16.021 --> 04:18.057
that it wasn't his good works

04:18.057 --> 04:21.060
that was going to earn
him a spot into heaven.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.696
The Bible tells us in
the 23rd verse here

04:23.696 --> 04:26.699
that all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.533
You and I, every one of
us that are here today,

04:28.533 --> 04:30.836
we confess that we've sinned

04:30.836 --> 04:33.038
and while we can't earn
our way, praise the Lord

04:33.038 --> 04:37.843
that by his amazing grace,
we have been justified.

04:37.843 --> 04:40.713
You see, the word
tells us in Verse 24,

04:40.713 --> 04:44.916
says, "Being justified
freely by his grace,

04:44.916 --> 04:48.586
"through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus."

04:48.586 --> 04:50.788
You see, what good
news to know that

04:50.788 --> 04:53.492
even though you and I couldn't
earn our way into heaven

04:53.492 --> 04:56.928
and even though we've all
sinned and in spite of all that,

04:56.928 --> 05:01.367
that we have been given
this divine gift of grace.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.569
This amazing grace has
justified you and I

05:03.569 --> 05:05.904
and made us right with God.

05:05.904 --> 05:08.072
It's through the events that
happened at Calvary's Hill

05:08.072 --> 05:11.843
where the blood of our only
begotten savior was shed

05:11.843 --> 05:13.846
that made a way for you and I.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.148
What glorious good
news today to know that

05:16.148 --> 05:17.983
even though we couldn't
earn our way into heaven

05:17.983 --> 05:22.454
that he's already
given freely access

05:22.454 --> 05:24.857
to heaven by his son,
Jesus Christ, Amen?

05:24.857 --> 05:25.824
- Amen.

05:26.824 --> 05:29.632
(light dramatic music)

05:33.632 --> 05:36.952
(lightly crying)

05:54.952 --> 05:58.456
- Well, you need to
get this handled.

05:58.456 --> 06:00.759
How does this quarter
match up to the last?

06:00.759 --> 06:02.593
- [Girl] Daddy?

06:02.593 --> 06:04.997
- Okay, I'll take a look
at the numbers tomorrow

06:04.997 --> 06:07.735

06:09.735 --> 06:10.968
What is it, Jade?

06:10.968 --> 06:11.004
I'm in a hurry.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.541
- It's important.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.908
- What is it then?

06:16.908 --> 06:18.543
(lightly crying)

06:18.543 --> 06:19.848
- I, I'm pregnant.

06:23.848 --> 06:25.050
(light dramatic music)

06:25.050 --> 06:25.851
- What?

06:26.851 --> 06:28.220
- I'm pregnant.

06:28.220 --> 06:32.156
- You're 15 years old,
what were you thinking?

06:32.156 --> 06:33.992
- I'm sorry.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.961
- Do you know what this
will do to my business?

06:35.961 --> 06:37.495
What will people say
when they find out

06:37.495 --> 06:40.732
I have a 15 year old
pregnant daughter?

06:40.732 --> 06:42.935
- Daddy, I'm sorry.

06:42.935 --> 06:45.670
- You know, you're
just like your mother.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.906
- [Jade] Daddy, please.

06:47.906 --> 06:49.208
- I'm done with you.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.011
As far as I'm concerned,
I have no daughter.

06:53.011 --> 06:57.615
- You can't make me leave.
- Get out of here.

06:57.615 --> 06:59.086

07:02.086 --> 07:03.622

Let's pray.

Lord and Savior,

07:41.593 --> 07:43.595
we thank you for
your many blessings

07:43.595 --> 07:44.896
and ask that you bless this food

07:44.896 --> 07:47.733

07:47.733 --> 07:49.901
and our bodies into
your great service.

07:49.901 --> 07:52.603
In your holy name,
we pray, Amen.

07:52.603 --> 07:53.040
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.976
Oh, happy anniversary,

07:58.976 --> 08:00.978
- Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks sweetheart.

08:00.978 --> 08:02.581
- What are you
guys doing tonight?

08:02.581 --> 08:04.682
- Well, actually we were
thinking about staying in,

08:04.682 --> 08:08.252
having our daughter
cook us a good meal

08:08.252 --> 08:10.555
and then maybe rub our feet.

08:10.555 --> 08:12.791
- Huh, funny, Dad.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.860
- That actually sounds
like a really great idea.

08:15.860 --> 08:20.699
- Luckily, I have choir
practice tonight, no feet there.

08:20.699 --> 08:22.733
- Well, I guess that just means
I'll have to take your Mom

08:22.733 --> 08:26.071
to one of those fancy
restaurants again this year.

08:26.071 --> 08:28.706

15:04.101 --> 15:05.669
- [Jade] I have
nowhere else to go.

15:05.669 --> 15:07.139
Wait, please, wait.

15:09.139 --> 15:14.446
Please come back, I have
nowhere else to go, please?

15:14.446 --> 15:17.148
(hitting door lightly)

15:17.148 --> 15:18.450
(crying)

15:18.450 --> 15:20.150
- I'll see you
all Sunday morning

15:20.150 --> 15:22.620
where we'll worship together
and remember, God is good

15:22.620 --> 15:24.722
- All the time.
- All the time,

15:24.722 --> 15:26.256
- [Group] God is good.

15:26.256 --> 15:29.234
(light peaceful music)

15:36.234 --> 15:38.168
- I really did have
a nice night tonight.

15:38.168 --> 15:40.538
Thank you for dinner.

15:40.538 --> 15:43.674
- You know, you and Faith
really mean the world to me.

15:43.674 --> 15:45.643
- We love you, too.

15:45.643 --> 15:47.578
- How have you put up
with me all these years?

15:47.578 --> 15:48.513
(chuckling)

15:48.513 --> 15:50.582
- I guess I'm a saint.

15:51.582 --> 15:54.523
(phone beeping)

15:58.523 --> 16:00.357
(tires screeching)
(screaming)

16:00.357 --> 16:03.761
(cars colliding loudly)

16:03.761 --> 16:05.496
(dramatic music)

16:05.496 --> 16:07.801
(groaning)

16:09.801 --> 16:12.538
- Greg, Greg, are you okay?

16:14.538 --> 16:16.541
Greg, are you okay?

16:16.541 --> 16:19.043
(siren wailing)

16:19.043 --> 16:21.552
(sobbing)

16:27.552 --> 16:30.432
- [Man] Get her out of there.

16:41.432 --> 16:43.336
Careful, pull up, okay?

16:46.336 --> 16:47.639
- I really like the
songs you have planned.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.474
I've never heard
some of them before

16:49.474 --> 16:50.575
but I'm sure they're gonna be

16:50.575 --> 16:52.110
a really bit hit with everyone.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.445
- The choir's excited.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.245
Just trying to keep it fresh.

16:55.245 --> 16:57.514
Can't sing the same
songs week after week.

16:57.514 --> 16:59.517
- You'd be surprised, we've
sang the same five songs

16:59.517 --> 17:02.821
every Sunday and Wednesday
for three months straight.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.757
- That's why you hired me
as the new music minister.

17:05.757 --> 17:07.325
- Have you guys started
on that math homework yet

17:07.325 --> 17:09.661
because I'm completely lost.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.564
- I was hoping
you'd help me out.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.132
- Math is easy.

17:14.132 --> 17:16.269
I got an A on my last math test.

17:18.269 --> 17:20.137
- Okay, smart one, do you
even know what algebra is?

17:20.137 --> 17:23.473
- No, but from the sound of
it, neither do any of you.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.541
(giggling)
- She's got a point.

17:25.541 --> 17:28.482
(dramatic music)

17:31.482 --> 17:33.451
- Hey, neighbor.
- Hey.

17:33.451 --> 17:35.220
I have some horrible news.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.521
Greg and Carol, they've been
in a horrific car crash.

17:37.521 --> 17:38.823
(gasping)
- Are they okay?

17:38.823 --> 17:40.357
- Carol, she's in
serious condition

17:40.357 --> 17:42.493
but Greg, I'm afraid
he didn't make it.

17:42.493 --> 17:44.434
- Oh my God, Faith.

17:50.434 --> 17:53.907
(phone ringing)

17:56.907 --> 17:59.546
- Hey, this is Pastor Mark.

18:01.546 --> 18:02.449
What, when?

18:04.449 --> 18:05.184
Where?

18:07.184 --> 18:10.555
Oh my gosh, yeah, I'll
be there right away.

18:10.555 --> 18:13.157
Oh God, please help this family.

18:13.157 --> 18:14.659
- [Woman] What is it?

18:14.659 --> 18:16.661
- It's Greg and Carol,
there's been an accident.

18:16.661 --> 18:18.395
(dramatic music)

18:18.395 --> 18:19.696
- Alright, tell me what we got.

18:19.696 --> 18:21.532
- Female, mid-40s,
internal bleeding,

18:21.532 --> 18:24.669
BP, 85 over 60, heart
rate is weak and running.

18:24.669 --> 18:26.471
She's lost a lot of blood.

18:26.471 --> 18:27.704
We've already given her
two liters of fluid.

18:27.704 --> 18:28.673
- Gotcha, we got it from here.

18:28.673 --> 18:30.262
Let's get her to O.R. now.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.237
(lightly crying)

18:59.237 --> 19:02.472
- Hi, is there any word
on Carol Bolin yet?

19:02.472 --> 19:04.608
(light dramatic music)

19:04.608 --> 19:06.211
- No sir, she's
still in surgery.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.612
If you'd like to take a
seat at the waiting area,

19:07.612 --> 19:09.480
we'll notify you when
there's any updates on her.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.549
- Okay, thank you.

19:12.549 --> 19:15.307
(light dramatic music)

20:09.307 --> 20:11.823
(sad piano music)

20:25.823 --> 20:27.057
- Bolin Family?

21:00.057 --> 21:03.394
- Oftentimes, we feel
as though we're entitled

21:03.394 --> 21:08.098
to a certain number of days
or years on this Earth.

21:08.098 --> 21:10.968
This is part of what makes
Greg and Carol's death

21:10.968 --> 21:14.771
so much more difficult to bear.

21:14.771 --> 21:16.874
One thing I need to
remind you, though,

21:16.874 --> 21:19.076
is the Bible makes
no such promise.

21:19.076 --> 21:20.845
As a matter of fact,
the Book of James,

21:20.845 --> 21:22.946
in the fourth chapter,
tells us that our life

21:22.946 --> 21:26.817
is just a vapor that's here
today and gone tomorrow.

21:26.817 --> 21:31.855
Psalms Verse Nine and 12
teach us to number our days

21:31.855 --> 21:34.726
so that we may gain
a heart of wisdom.

21:34.726 --> 21:38.628
Death is always near us,
walking beside each of us

21:38.628 --> 21:42.400
as a constant companion and
many of you that are here today,

21:42.400 --> 21:44.402
you know that all too well.

21:44.402 --> 21:46.770
You realize that the only
reason you're still here today

21:46.770 --> 21:49.507
is because of God's
grace and mercy,

21:49.507 --> 21:50.875
where he saved you
from a situation

21:50.875 --> 21:53.411
that you shouldn't
have walked away from

21:53.411 --> 21:56.547
because it was
part of God's plan.

21:56.547 --> 22:00.050
The Bible tells us in
Matthew Chapter 29,

22:00.050 --> 22:02.720
that not one sparrow
falls from the sky

22:02.720 --> 22:05.155
without the will of God

22:05.155 --> 22:06.790
and he goes on to tell us

22:06.790 --> 22:10.728
that you are much more
valuable than many sparrows.

22:10.728 --> 22:15.633
As tragic as it is to see
the death of Greg and Carol,

22:15.633 --> 22:16.968
I wanna remind you
and comfort you

22:16.968 --> 22:20.875
that this, too, is
part of God's plan.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.942
- I don't understand.

22:25.942 --> 22:28.546
Why can't you just
come live with us?

22:28.546 --> 22:31.615
I don't want you
to leave, Faith.

22:31.615 --> 22:34.786
- [Girl] I'm gonna
miss you so much.

22:34.786 --> 22:37.688
- I know, I'm gonna
miss you both.

22:37.688 --> 22:39.824
I'll never have friends
like you ever again.

22:39.824 --> 22:41.625
- Hey, that's not true.

22:41.625 --> 22:42.027
You'll always have
friends like us

22:43.027 --> 22:45.529
because we're always
gonna be here for you.

22:45.529 --> 22:47.031
- And I mean, I know no
one can compare to us

22:48.031 --> 22:50.867
but let's face it,
you're amazing.

22:50.867 --> 22:54.910
You're gonna find amazing
people who wanna be with you.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.847
- Come here, take my hand.

23:03.847 --> 23:07.117
Dear Daddy Jesus,
thank you so much

23:07.117 --> 23:08.920
for my best friend, Faith.

23:08.920 --> 23:13.790
I love her so much and she
is such an amazing person

23:13.790 --> 23:16.827
but right now, she's going
through a really hard time

23:16.827 --> 23:18.863
and she's hurting a lot

23:18.863 --> 23:21.566
and I know all I wanna do is
have her stay here with me

23:21.566 --> 23:22.900
so I can give her a big hug

23:22.900 --> 23:25.769
and make all of her
problems go away.

23:25.769 --> 23:27.005
I know I can't do that.

23:28.005 --> 23:31.877
So God, even though it's
really hard, today I let her go

23:33.877 --> 23:36.847
so you can come and put
your arms around her

23:36.847 --> 23:38.115
'cause I know only in your arms

23:38.115 --> 23:41.519
can she truly
start to be healed.

23:41.519 --> 23:43.954
And God, I also pray that
you would bring new friends

23:43.954 --> 23:46.223
into Faith's life
that will love her

23:46.223 --> 23:49.894
and lead her down
the right path.

23:49.894 --> 23:51.895
We trust you, Jesus.

23:51.895 --> 23:53.964
You're the only reason
we can look to the future

23:53.964 --> 23:54.534
and have hope.

23:56.534 --> 24:00.045
In your mighty, loving
name we pray, Amen.

24:08.045 --> 24:09.646
(knocking on door)

24:09.646 --> 24:11.848
- Pastor Mark, can I talk
with you for a minute?

24:11.848 --> 24:13.851
- Yeah, absolutely, come on in.

24:13.851 --> 24:16.923
(light piano music)

24:18.923 --> 24:21.992
- I don't know if Faith
can cope with all of this.

24:21.992 --> 24:25.962
She just lost her parents,
has to move to a new city,

24:25.962 --> 24:27.230
leave behind all her friends

24:27.230 --> 24:30.968
and move in with family
she hardly knows.

24:30.968 --> 24:32.737
- Jay, she's gonna be alright

24:32.737 --> 24:36.540
and I know this is tough but
her name is Faith for a reason.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.075
You know, it's easy to say

24:38.075 --> 24:40.912
that God has a plan for our
life but it's times like this,

24:40.912 --> 24:44.147
we really have to have
faith and know that he does.

24:44.147 --> 24:46.284
The word reminds us that
God works all things

24:46.284 --> 24:48.219
to the good of
those that love him

24:48.219 --> 24:51.055
and are the called
according to his purposes.

24:51.055 --> 24:54.258
God really does have a
plan for Faith's life

24:54.258 --> 24:57.127
and as tough as this
may be, I promise you

24:57.127 --> 24:59.931
that God's gonna use
this to mold her life

24:59.931 --> 25:02.833
in ways that you and I
could never even imagine.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.301
- I know, but my job
is to help these kids

25:04.301 --> 25:07.637
any way that I can and I've
never experienced anything

25:07.637 --> 25:09.272
like this before.

25:09.272 --> 25:12.643
Greg and Carol
were good friends.

25:12.643 --> 25:14.979
I feel like I'm failing them.

25:14.979 --> 25:16.580
I feel like I'm failing Faith.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.249
- No Jay, you're
not failing them

25:18.249 --> 25:21.852
and you're certainly
not failing Faith.

25:21.852 --> 25:23.820
Greg and Carol were
some of the best people

25:23.820 --> 25:25.288
I've ever had the
privilege of knowing

25:25.288 --> 25:28.659
and this doesn't
just affect you.

25:28.659 --> 25:30.126
This has affected
our entire church

25:30.126 --> 25:32.663
and it's really shaken
the entire community.

25:32.663 --> 25:34.131
This loss at the
center of all of it

25:34.131 --> 25:38.035
is this innocent young
girl who's lost her parents

25:38.035 --> 25:41.905
and she's hurting, Jay, and
she just needs us right now.

25:41.905 --> 25:44.342
She needs our prayers
more than anything.

25:44.342 --> 25:48.179
She doesn't think for one
second that you're failing her.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.880
Matter of fact, just
you being here right now

25:49.880 --> 25:53.718
shows how much you really
do care about her, Jay.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.086
She's gonna be alright.

25:55.086 --> 25:57.788
God's gonna take care
of her, I promise.

25:57.788 --> 26:00.290
- I hope you're
right, Pastor Mark.

26:00.290 --> 26:02.093
- I know I am.

26:02.093 --> 26:05.032
(light dramatic music)

26:09.032 --> 26:10.836
- What do I do?

26:12.836 --> 26:15.342
How can I live without you?

26:18.342 --> 26:21.780
Why would God take
you away from me?

26:23.780 --> 26:27.121
I've always worshiped
him and praised him.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.090
What did I do wrong?

26:34.090 --> 26:36.961
Why would he do this to me?

26:37.961 --> 26:39.265
I just don't understand.

26:41.265 --> 26:43.140
(crying)

26:49.140 --> 26:52.242
- Faith, I'm sorry but we
need to get on the road.

26:52.242 --> 26:55.145
We've got a long
drive ahead of us.

26:55.145 --> 26:56.913
- I love you, Mom and Dad.

26:56.913 --> 26:59.338
I'm gonna miss you both so much.

27:55.338 --> 27:58.244
(dramatic music)

28:01.244 --> 28:04.515
- Yeah, I played golf
with the mayor yesterday.

28:04.515 --> 28:06.051
He said everything's okay.

28:08.051 --> 28:10.887
I think we got the
problem ironed down.

28:10.887 --> 28:14.290
That's right, I
had to let Ted go.

28:14.290 --> 28:17.583
He just couldn't
get the job done.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.317
I feel bad for
him and his family

29:14.317 --> 29:16.155
but, you know, it is what it is.

29:19.155 --> 29:20.565
That's right.

29:27.565 --> 29:30.267
Okay, that sounds good.

29:30.267 --> 29:31.434
We'll wrap it up tomorrow.

29:31.434 --> 29:32.148
Okay, bye.

29:45.148 --> 29:48.184
(phone ringing)

29:48.184 --> 29:49.088
Hello, this is Frank.

29:52.088 --> 29:56.494
I need you to send me the
Jacobson contracts by tomorrow.

29:58.494 --> 30:01.284
Hey, I need to call you back.

30:20.284 --> 30:23.186
(phone ringing)

30:23.186 --> 30:25.588
Hello, this is Frank.

30:25.588 --> 30:27.258
Yes, Mr. Johnson.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.294
We're gonna have everything
to you by tomorrow.

30:30.294 --> 30:31.211
That's right.

30:48.211 --> 30:50.346
- Roger, what are you doing?

30:50.346 --> 30:51.315
- What does it look
like I'm doing?

30:51.315 --> 30:53.349
I'm working on my truck.

30:53.349 --> 30:56.153
- Faith's on the way and
she's been through a lot

30:56.153 --> 30:58.288
and I want you to be
on your best behavior.

30:58.288 --> 31:00.362
- That's your family, not mine.

31:05.362 --> 31:08.246
- Here she comes,
I mean it, Roger.

31:22.246 --> 31:24.580
Hey, sweetie, you
have a good trip?

31:24.580 --> 31:25.715
- It was okay.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.317
- Okay, well come on.

31:27.317 --> 31:30.528
We'll take you up to
see your room, okay?

31:37.528 --> 31:39.166
- Hi, I'm Pastor Jay.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.337
- You can take those on inside.

31:47.337 --> 31:48.515
- Okay.

31:58.515 --> 31:59.352
Alright now, Faith.

32:01.352 --> 32:04.021
Remember, keep your namesake,
I'm only a call away.

32:05.021 --> 32:05.021
- Thank you, Pastor Jay.

32:05.756 --> 32:07.324
Thank you for everything.

32:07.324 --> 32:10.471
- You're welcome,
I'll talk to you soon.

32:21.471 --> 32:24.746
(phone ringing)

32:28.746 --> 32:29.748
- Hey.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.782
- How's it going
over there so far?

32:32.782 --> 32:34.751
- I guess okay.

32:34.751 --> 32:37.488
I don't really think
Uncle Roger wants me here.

32:37.488 --> 32:40.057
- Come on, I'm sure
that's not true.

32:40.057 --> 32:41.026
You know I miss you
so much already.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.660
I wish you could come
back and live with us.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.031
- I know, I miss you, too.

32:48.031 --> 32:50.334
I start at my new
school tomorrow.

32:50.334 --> 32:52.568
- Well, I'm sure you'll
meet plenty of new people.

32:52.568 --> 32:55.271
Just be your old happy
self and you'll be fine.

32:55.271 --> 32:58.076
- I don't know if
I can be right now.

33:00.076 --> 33:02.645
- How long is she
gonna be here anyway?

33:02.645 --> 33:04.781
- As long as she
needs to be here.

33:04.781 --> 33:07.084
We're the only
family she has left.

33:07.084 --> 33:10.054
- No, you're the only
family she has left.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.189
- Why do you keep saying that?

33:12.189 --> 33:14.691
Roger, you married
into this family.

33:14.691 --> 33:17.327
- But it's still not mine.

33:17.327 --> 33:22.165
No matter how hard you
try, it never will be.

33:22.165 --> 33:25.269
- Roger, this is our chance.

33:25.269 --> 33:29.343
This is our chance to move
forward after all these years.

33:33.343 --> 33:36.550
- [Roger] After all these years.

33:40.550 --> 33:43.246
(light peaceful music)

34:43.246 --> 34:44.481
- [Aunt] Morning, sweetie.

34:44.481 --> 34:45.449
- Morning.

34:46.449 --> 34:47.518
- [Aunt] Made you
some breakfast.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.186
Hope you like scrambled eggs.

34:49.186 --> 34:50.389
- Yes, ma'am.

34:52.389 --> 34:54.590
Lord, thank you for this food.

34:54.590 --> 34:58.599
Please bless it to the
nourishment in my body, Amen.

35:02.599 --> 35:04.204
- Just lost my appetite.

35:07.204 --> 35:09.206
Hey, hun, I'm just gonna grab
something on my way to work.

35:09.206 --> 35:10.244
- [Aunt] Okay.

35:15.244 --> 35:18.333
(light peaceful music)

36:09.333 --> 36:11.568
- Faith, hurry,
we're gonna be late.

36:11.568 --> 36:13.289
- [Faith] I'm coming.

36:32.289 --> 36:35.943
- Dogwood's pretty
this time of year.

36:53.943 --> 36:55.344
- Faith, where you going?

36:55.344 --> 36:57.947
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

36:57.947 --> 36:59.882
(groaning)

36:59.882 --> 37:01.518
- Here, I'll get that for you.

37:01.518 --> 37:03.786
- Well, thank you, sweetie.

37:03.786 --> 37:04.822
Thank you.

37:05.822 --> 37:08.527
Oh my, you look like an angel.

37:10.527 --> 37:13.063
- Come on, Faith, we're late.

37:13.063 --> 37:15.065
- That's your name, Faith?

37:15.065 --> 37:17.668
(giggling)
- Yes, ma'am.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.871
- Don't let 'em change you.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.838
- Well, have a blessed day.

37:22.838 --> 37:26.856
- [Woman] Thank you,
you too, darling.

37:40.856 --> 37:42.759
- I'm gonna be late.

37:42.759 --> 37:45.094
Um, do you think that you
could register yourself?

37:45.094 --> 37:46.697
- [Faith] Yes, ma'am.

37:46.697 --> 37:49.432
- [Aunt] Just try
to fit in, okay?

37:49.432 --> 37:51.534
And have a good day, alright?

37:51.534 --> 37:53.750
And I'll pick you up, just go.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.452
- Watch it, freak.
- Sorry.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.722
- [Girl] You better be.

38:12.722 --> 38:15.914
(light dramatic music)

38:37.914 --> 38:41.018
- God, please keep Faith
strong in your word.

38:42.018 --> 38:44.788
I know that you are
our Father in heaven,

38:44.788 --> 38:48.157
that you can provide
for all things

38:48.157 --> 38:51.827
and that you alone are
our strongest tower,

38:51.827 --> 38:53.865
our strength and our way.

38:55.865 --> 38:58.902
Help her to face these
giants before her.

38:58.902 --> 39:00.871
Help her to understand that
even the smallest stone

39:00.871 --> 39:03.072
can vanquish the
tallest of them.

39:03.072 --> 39:06.543
My trust is given
to you, Father.

39:06.543 --> 39:07.844
Though she has lost
those who have loved

39:07.844 --> 39:11.717
and guided her thus
far, help her to endure.

39:13.717 --> 39:17.590
Let her see the way,
the only way, your way.

39:21.590 --> 39:24.563
In your son's
name, I pray, Amen.

39:27.563 --> 39:30.904
(students chattering)

39:33.904 --> 39:36.474
- Hey check it out, a new girl.

39:38.474 --> 39:39.876
They always say
modest is hottest

39:39.876 --> 39:41.911
but I think she took
that way too seriously.

39:41.911 --> 39:43.813
- Well, it's a
nice change of pace

39:43.813 --> 39:45.815
from what we usually
see around here.

39:45.815 --> 39:47.855
Come on, let's get to class.

39:51.855 --> 39:54.132
(students chattering)

40:02.132 --> 40:04.634
(bell ringing)

40:04.634 --> 40:07.538
(students chattering)

40:08.538 --> 40:09.972
- Sorry I'm late.

40:09.972 --> 40:13.951
- It's no problem, why
don't you take a seat?

40:20.951 --> 40:22.719
- I can't wait
that long, though.

40:22.719 --> 40:23.619
- Hey, Michael.

40:23.619 --> 40:24.588
- Hey, Katie.

40:25.588 --> 40:27.590
Think we're having pizza.

40:27.590 --> 40:29.925
- Hey dude, check
out her bookbag.

40:29.925 --> 40:31.862
- What is she, a nun?

40:31.862 --> 40:33.230
(chuckling)

40:33.230 --> 40:35.032
- Caleb and Jacob,
see me after class.

40:36.032 --> 40:39.936
I have some extra
homework for you two.

40:40.936 --> 40:44.608
Now class, let's give
our new classmate

40:44.608 --> 40:46.711
a proper Central High welcome.

40:48.711 --> 40:52.885
Would you stand up and tell
us a little about yourself?

40:54.885 --> 40:56.786
- My name is Faith.

40:56.786 --> 40:58.954
- [Boy] Of course it is.

40:58.954 --> 41:02.858
- I just moved to this city
to live with my aunt and uncle

41:02.858 --> 41:05.961
and that's pretty much it.

41:05.961 --> 41:07.731
- Cool story, tell it again.

41:07.731 --> 41:10.034
(giggling)

41:11.034 --> 41:13.036
- Thank you, Faith.

41:13.036 --> 41:14.771
Now class, we're
going to pick up

41:14.771 --> 41:16.806
where we left off yesterday.

41:16.806 --> 41:17.740
If you'll please
take out your books

41:17.740 --> 41:19.876
and turn to page 375.

41:20.876 --> 41:23.947
(sighs loudly)

41:24.947 --> 41:27.050
- Hey, do you need some help?

41:27.050 --> 41:28.018
- That's okay, I'll
just go to the office.

41:29.018 --> 41:31.086
- [Michael] You don't have to
do that, I'll get it for you.

41:31.086 --> 41:32.023
(bangs loudly)

41:33.023 --> 41:33.023
There you go.

41:34.023 --> 41:35.057
- Thanks.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.192
- By the way, my name's Michael.

41:36.192 --> 41:37.693
- [Faith] Faith.

41:37.693 --> 41:39.061
- Yeah, I was just
in class with you.

41:39.061 --> 41:39.130
- Oh, yeah.

41:41.130 --> 41:42.699
- Don't worry about it.

41:42.699 --> 41:44.867
New school, you're
allowed to be nervous.

41:44.867 --> 41:46.268
- Come on, let's go.

41:46.268 --> 41:49.105
- Alright, well I gotta
go, see you around, Faith.

41:49.105 --> 41:52.601
(light dramatic music)

42:18.601 --> 42:20.369
- [Faith] Here, let me get that.

42:20.369 --> 42:22.007
- Ah, you are too kind.

42:25.007 --> 42:26.376
- It's no problem.

42:26.376 --> 42:27.943
Here, let me walk
you to your house.

42:27.943 --> 42:29.779
- You don't have to do that.

42:29.779 --> 42:30.880
- I want to.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.851
- You have such a giving heart.

42:34.851 --> 42:36.385
- Faith, what are you doing?

42:36.385 --> 42:40.028
- [Faith] It will just take a
second, I'll be right there.

42:46.028 --> 42:49.934
- You're such a
blessing to me, Faith.

42:51.934 --> 42:53.268
Do you know the Lord?

42:53.268 --> 42:54.005
- Yes, ma'am.

42:56.005 --> 43:00.213
- I believe he's got some
big plans for you, sweetie.

43:03.213 --> 43:07.018
Do you mind if I ask why
you're living next door?

43:08.018 --> 43:09.289
- It's a long story.

43:14.289 --> 43:17.293
Well, I need to get going.

43:17.293 --> 43:19.795
- Thank you so
much for your help.

43:19.795 --> 43:21.164
- I can pick up
your paper for you

43:21.164 --> 43:22.831
in the morning before
I head to school.

43:22.831 --> 43:24.400
- Oh, you don't have
to do that, sweetie.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.369
- No, I want to.

43:26.369 --> 43:28.103
- Well, thank you.

43:28.103 --> 43:29.405
- You're welcome.

43:29.405 --> 43:30.425
- Bu bye.
- Bye.

Maybe it'll be quieter there.

47:30.646 --> 47:32.164
- Don't be home late.

47:49.164 --> 47:51.001
- So, how's your niece doing?

47:52.001 --> 47:53.335
- If her parents hadn't left
us a butt-load of money,

47:53.335 --> 47:55.605
she'd be out on the street.

47:55.605 --> 47:58.407
- Yeah right, that's
your niece, man.

47:58.407 --> 48:00.309
- No, it's Pam's niece.

48:00.309 --> 48:04.452
No member of my family
ever even mentioned God.

48:09.452 --> 48:13.295
Hey Brian, bring me that 10
millimeter wrench, would ya?

48:20.295 --> 48:21.030
Thanks.

48:22.030 --> 48:25.668
- So, you mean to tell me you
don't believe in God at all?

48:25.668 --> 48:28.237
- I'm telling you, churches
are just a legal way

48:28.237 --> 48:30.306
to steal people's
money and brainwash 'em

48:30.306 --> 48:33.141
to thinking if they
do good and don't sin,

48:33.141 --> 48:35.478
they'll have eternal life.

48:35.478 --> 48:38.547
Well let me tell ya, when
you die, you're dead.

48:38.547 --> 48:41.317
There's no afterlife.

48:41.317 --> 48:44.353
- Well man, I hope you're wrong.

48:44.353 --> 48:48.404
- Show me a real miracle,
then I'll believe.

49:01.404 --> 49:04.474
- [Faith] Hey Mrs. Bell,
I got your mail for you.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.481
- Faith, you are so kind.

49:12.481 --> 49:14.021
Be careful.
- I'll be okay.

49:18.021 --> 49:20.630
- I'll be praying for you.

49:28.630 --> 49:31.534
- Hey, let me ask you something,

49:31.534 --> 49:34.469
now that we're family and all.

49:34.469 --> 49:37.773
When you're praying
and talking to God,

49:37.773 --> 49:40.309
you ever ask him why
he killed your parents?

49:40.309 --> 49:43.550
(light dramatic music)

49:47.550 --> 49:51.119
- I hate it here,
I wanna go home.

49:51.119 --> 49:52.454
I just don't understand

49:52.454 --> 49:55.525
why God would let
me go through this.

49:55.525 --> 49:57.326
What did I do wrong?

49:57.326 --> 49:59.762
- Faith, you didn't
do anything wrong.

49:59.762 --> 50:02.331
I wish I could explain why
this is happening to you

50:02.331 --> 50:03.068
but I can't.

50:06.068 --> 50:07.503
Just know that God
hasn't forsaken you

50:07.503 --> 50:10.806
and he's gonna be with you
through this entire thing.

50:10.806 --> 50:13.476
Just please don't
give up, Faith.

50:13.476 --> 50:15.143
Continue to be in
prayer with the Lord

50:15.143 --> 50:17.179
and ask him for guidance.

50:17.179 --> 50:18.547
He'll show you the way.

50:18.547 --> 50:20.083
- But when?

50:20.083 --> 50:23.619
How long do I have
to go through this?

50:23.619 --> 50:27.322
- I don't know but I do know
that God will be with you

50:27.322 --> 50:29.525
every step of they way.

50:29.525 --> 50:31.626
Something good will
come out of this.

50:31.626 --> 50:34.230
- I'm trying so
hard to believe that

50:34.230 --> 50:36.699
but I miss Mom and Dad.

50:36.699 --> 50:38.570
I miss my friends.

50:41.570 --> 50:43.775
- I know, Faith, I know.

50:46.775 --> 50:50.623
(students chattering)

51:01.623 --> 51:03.126
- Who does she think she is,

51:03.126 --> 51:05.460
thinking she could
take him from me?

51:05.460 --> 51:08.797
And Michael keeps staring
at her, it's disgusting.

51:08.797 --> 51:10.465
She thinks she's such
a good Christian like,

51:10.465 --> 51:14.170
"Oh, look at me, I'm so
much better than everyone."

51:14.170 --> 51:19.541
Give me a break, I mean, I know
what she really wants here.

51:19.541 --> 51:22.244
Hannah, did you hear the real
reason why she moved here?

51:22.244 --> 51:23.514
- Katie, shh, stop.

51:25.514 --> 51:28.518
- Huh, what do you want
me to do, apologize?

51:28.518 --> 51:30.753
(laughing)

51:30.753 --> 51:34.695
(light dramatic music)

51:39.695 --> 51:41.864
(crying)
- God, I don't know

51:41.864 --> 51:43.666
what I did wrong.

51:44.666 --> 51:47.637
I don't know why
everyone hates me.

51:47.637 --> 51:49.373
I'm trying so hard.

51:51.373 --> 51:52.844
I just wanna fit in.

51:54.844 --> 51:58.547
I don't wanna be
lonely anymore, God.

51:58.547 --> 52:02.632
Please, please, God, I
don't know what to do.

52:49.632 --> 52:54.737
♪ He saved me from
my afflictions

52:54.737 --> 52:59.842
♪ You've heard me
through all the noise

52:59.842 --> 53:03.748

(clapping)

54:34.969 --> 54:39.407
- That was awesome,
you have such a gift.

54:39.407 --> 54:41.943
Wait, I'm sorry, I
just heard you singing.

54:41.943 --> 54:43.746
Did you write that?

54:43.746 --> 54:45.358
- I've gotta go.

54:56.358 --> 54:57.827
(knocking on door)
- Hey boss?

54:57.827 --> 54:59.394
Congratulations on getting
that Murphy contract.

54:59.394 --> 55:00.695
- Yeah, thanks.

55:00.695 --> 55:01.996
We really need to
ramp up production

55:01.996 --> 55:03.798
if we're gonna
meet the deadlines.

55:03.798 --> 55:05.871
- How's Jade, by the way?

55:08.871 --> 55:10.806
- Don't forget, I need
that McKinley file

55:10.806 --> 55:12.043
by the end of the day.

55:14.043 --> 55:15.978
- Yes sir, you'll have
it by the end of the day.

55:15.978 --> 55:19.481
(light dramatic music)

55:19.481 --> 55:21.552
(sighs heavily)

55:56.552 --> 55:58.757
- God, why is this so hard?

56:01.757 --> 56:05.728
I've always tried
to do your will.

56:05.728 --> 56:09.465
Your word says that
you'll never forsake me

56:09.465 --> 56:10.469
but I feel so alone.

56:13.469 --> 56:17.972
I feel like I'm lost, somewhere
I've never been before

56:17.972 --> 56:20.543
and I can't find my way out.

56:21.543 --> 56:23.681
Please help me understand.

56:26.681 --> 56:29.452
- Is there something
I can help you with?

56:29.452 --> 56:31.654
Seems like something's
troubling you.

56:31.654 --> 56:35.523
- I just don't understand
what God wants from me.

56:35.523 --> 56:37.726
- I know that feeling well.

56:37.726 --> 56:40.128
Did something happen that
brought these feelings out?

56:40.128 --> 56:41.831
- I recently lost
both my parents

56:41.831 --> 56:44.000
and had to move to live
with my aunt and uncle.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.001
- I'm sorry to hear that.

56:47.001 --> 56:49.005
You know, losing a loved
one is a terrible thing.

56:50.005 --> 56:52.942
Did they happen to have a
relationship with Jesus Christ?

56:52.942 --> 56:54.010
- Yes sir, they were
both Christians.

56:55.010 --> 56:56.512
- Well then, you have
the comfort in knowing

56:56.512 --> 56:57.913
that they were in
covenant with God

56:57.913 --> 56:59.215
through his son, Jesus Christ

56:59.215 --> 57:01.217
and they will have eternal life.

57:01.217 --> 57:05.521
- I know, I just
miss them so much.

57:05.521 --> 57:07.523
- It's okay to miss them

57:07.523 --> 57:08.990
and even a mourning
period is needed

57:08.990 --> 57:11.659
but when the time comes,
will you praise and thank God

57:11.659 --> 57:13.728
for the time you had
with your parents

57:13.728 --> 57:15.197
or will you be bitter?

57:15.197 --> 57:17.666
Always questioning
his reasoning?

57:17.666 --> 57:21.170
You see, the answers are
not always easy to find.

57:21.170 --> 57:25.240
Sometimes, we've got to
rely strictly on God's word.

57:25.240 --> 57:28.577
I'm sure you're familiar with
2 Corinthians Five and Seven.

57:28.577 --> 57:30.880
- For you walk by
faith, not by sight.

57:30.880 --> 57:34.182
- Keep the faith and
God'll see you through.

57:34.182 --> 57:35.751
- Thank you.

57:35.751 --> 57:37.152
- You're welcome, why
don't you come and join us

57:37.152 --> 57:40.025
for Sunday service,
we'd love to have you.

57:44.025 --> 57:46.663
(bell ringing)

57:47.663 --> 57:50.929
(light dramatic music)

58:20.929 --> 58:23.965
(phone ringing)

58:23.965 --> 58:25.601
- Hello?

58:25.601 --> 58:27.135
- [Michael] Hey, is this Faith?

58:27.135 --> 58:28.704
- Yes.

58:28.704 --> 58:30.306
- [Michael] This is
Michael from school.

58:30.306 --> 58:31.574
- Oh, hey.

58:32.574 --> 58:33.876
- [Michael] Listen, I
just wanted to apologize

58:33.876 --> 58:35.945
for walking in on
you the other day.

58:35.945 --> 58:37.246
I heard you from the hall

58:37.246 --> 58:38.014
and I don't know
what I was thinking.

58:39.014 --> 58:41.884
- It's fine, really,
don't worry about it.

58:41.884 --> 58:43.885
It's just, that was
the first time I sang

58:43.885 --> 58:46.922
in front of anybody
since my parents died.

58:46.922 --> 58:48.023
- [Michael] I'm
sorry, I had no idea.

58:49.023 --> 58:50.759
Can I make it up to you?

58:50.759 --> 58:53.128
Maybe I can take you
to dinner sometime?

58:53.128 --> 58:54.731
- Yeah, I'd like that.

58:56.731 --> 58:58.766
K, well I'll talk to you later.

58:58.766 --> 58:59.983
Bye.
- Bye.

59:14.983 --> 59:16.018
- Wow, you must be hungry.

59:17.018 --> 59:20.054
- Actually, I was hoping
I could bring this food

59:20.054 --> 59:21.023
to a girl I've seen in the park.

59:22.023 --> 59:23.224
She looks hungry.

59:23.224 --> 59:24.960
She looks like she needs help.

59:24.960 --> 59:29.297
- There's no stopping your
kindness is there, Faith?

59:29.297 --> 59:32.034
Just go ahead and
get what you need.

59:32.034 --> 59:33.378
- Thanks, Aunt Pam.

59:42.378 --> 59:43.679
Bye.
- Bye.

59:44.679 --> 59:47.163
(light dramatic music)

01:00:01.163 --> 01:00:04.094
Carol, you raised a
wonderful daughter.

01:01:40.094 --> 01:01:42.432
(chattering)

01:02:18.432 --> 01:02:21.570
- Let's go Caleb!
- Oh my God, go Caleb!

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:24.561
(cheering)

01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:48.996
- That's a good
book you're reading.

01:02:48.996 --> 01:02:49.065
- Yes, sir.

01:02:51.065 --> 01:02:53.135
Has a lot of great
stories in it.

01:02:53.135 --> 01:02:55.838
Fearless leaders,
courageous triumphs,

01:02:55.838 --> 01:03:00.141
and selfless acts, but most
of all, it's about hope,

01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:03.545
salvation, and
unconditional love.

01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:05.514
- Yes sir, it is.

01:03:05.514 --> 01:03:07.983
- Do you mind if I share
my testimony with you?

01:03:07.983 --> 01:03:09.318
- [Faith] Sure.

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.320
- I was once a college
football player

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.856
with a promising pro career.

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:16.391
Then my sophomore year,
I tore my knee up.

01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:18.126
I worked hard and
I prayed to God

01:03:18.126 --> 01:03:20.963
to give me the strength to
come back and play again.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.233
He did but less
than a year later,

01:03:25.233 --> 01:03:28.202
I blew out my other knee even
worse than the first time.

01:03:28.202 --> 01:03:31.139
You know, I started
to ask god why?

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:32.608
Why would he let me work so hard

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.543
to come back from
the first knee injury

01:03:34.543 --> 01:03:36.378
just to let it happen again?

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:38.280
- I'm so sorry.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.085
- Thanks, but I knew God
had greater plans for me,

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:45.987
plans that I was not aware of,

01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:49.423
plans even greater than
playing the game of football.

01:03:49.423 --> 01:03:53.494
So, let God lead you
towards his plans for you.

01:03:53.494 --> 01:03:55.065
- I will, thanks.

01:03:57.065 --> 01:03:58.367
- Hey Rev, I didn't
see you up there.

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.268
How you doing?
- What's up, how you doing?

01:04:00.268 --> 01:04:01.003
Hey coach, how's
my nephew doing?

01:04:02.003 --> 01:04:03.405
- Man, he's really knocking
the cover off the ball.

01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:05.340
- Well, how's his
fielding going?

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.942
- He's having a great year.

01:04:06.942 --> 01:04:08.251
- [Rev] That's good.

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:19.655
- You have a wonderful day.
- You, too.

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:22.556
You really need to
cut Faith some slack.

01:04:22.556 --> 01:04:24.259
She's been through a lot

01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:26.028
and she doesn't deserve you
always being mean to her.

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:29.431
- Come on, I'm doing
that girl a favor.

01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:30.699
Sooner she forgets
all this God nonsense,

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:32.938
the sooner she can fit in.

01:04:36.938 --> 01:04:39.407
You remember when we met?

01:04:39.407 --> 01:04:42.411
You were so full
of that God stuff.

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:47.282
Good thing you got that
out of your system, huh?

01:04:47.282 --> 01:04:48.289
- Shut up, Roger.

01:04:55.289 --> 01:04:58.059
- So when they had
eaten breakfast,

01:04:58.059 --> 01:05:00.394
Jesus said to Simon Peter,

01:05:00.394 --> 01:05:05.434
"Simon, son of Jonah, do you
love me more than these?"

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:09.503
He said, "Yes Lord, you
know that I love you."

01:05:09.503 --> 01:05:14.376
Jesus says to him, "Feed my
sheep," three different times

01:05:14.376 --> 01:05:17.746
and what did Jesus mean
when he said over and over

01:05:17.746 --> 01:05:21.215
for Peter to tend
and feed his sheep?

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:23.585
You know, most of us
think of feeding an animal

01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:29.391
to be food of some sort but
what Jesus was saying to Peter

01:05:29.391 --> 01:05:32.693
was that he would be charged
with overseeing the church

01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:35.563
and he would be charged
with overseeing the church

01:05:35.563 --> 01:05:39.534
as well as to ensure
that the word of God

01:05:39.534 --> 01:05:43.237
and his sheep, you and
I, would be fed the word.

01:05:43.237 --> 01:05:45.673
The disciples, at the
time, did not realize

01:05:45.673 --> 01:05:47.775
that Jesus would
have to go and die

01:05:47.775 --> 01:05:51.313
for your sins and mine
and they would be charged

01:05:51.313 --> 01:05:54.516
with spreading the
gospel to the world.

01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:55.617
Amen?

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:57.284
- [Congregation] Amen.

01:05:57.284 --> 01:05:59.487
- [Man] Well, we have a
special guest today with us

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:01.590
that's gonna be
singing a song for us.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.313
Faith, would you come on up?

01:06:25.313 --> 01:06:29.454
♪ When I'm scared, let
your grace fall down

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:37.829
♪ When I'm lost, in
you I will be found

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:46.105

I'm so glad you came.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.643
- Me too, sweetie,
you did a great job.

01:08:01.643 --> 01:08:03.577
- [Faith] Thank you.

01:08:03.577 --> 01:08:04.411

01:08:04.411 --> 01:08:05.746
- Hey, Michael.

01:08:05.746 --> 01:08:07.481
- I wanna introduce
you to my parents.

01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:10.452
- Hi Faith, I'm Rachel and
this is my husband, Mike.

01:08:10.452 --> 01:08:12.786
- Hi Faith, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:08:12.786 --> 01:08:15.556
- I can see why Michael
talks about you all the time.

01:08:15.556 --> 01:08:17.524
You are a very pretty girl.

01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:18.760
(giggling nervously)
- Thank you.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.694
- Come on, Mom, sorry Faith.

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:21.694
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:22.314
- Okay.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:41.615
- How can I help you, dear?

01:08:41.615 --> 01:08:43.716
- I need to see a doctor.

01:08:43.716 --> 01:08:44.787
- What about?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:46.956
- Pregnancy.

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:52.560
- Okay, right, if you
could just fill this out

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.273
as best as you can,
we'll send you on back.

01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:09.814
- Well, looks like it's
for sure, you're pregnant.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.817
- How am I supposed
to take care of it?

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:18.756
- With love and compassion.

01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:25.658
- What if I don't want it?

01:09:25.658 --> 01:09:28.496
(light dramatic music)

01:09:28.496 --> 01:09:31.703
- I'm sorry but we
don't do that here.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.439
Listen, what I can do for you

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.707
is write you a prescription
so you have the right medicine

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:45.511
and you and your baby
are healthy throughout
the pregnancy.

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:49.685
And I can tell you that every
child is a gift from God.

01:09:52.685 --> 01:09:54.693
Jade, wait, your medication.

01:09:58.693 --> 01:09:59.961
- Do you wanna go
get something to eat?

01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:02.396
- Sure.
- Alright, let's go.

01:10:02.396 --> 01:10:04.632
- Uh, you know, we played
baseball for a while, so...

01:10:04.632 --> 01:10:06.768
- Dear Lord, thank you
for your blessings.

01:10:06.768 --> 01:10:08.636
Thank you for the
food you provide.

01:10:08.636 --> 01:10:11.672
Please bless it to the
nourishment of our bodies, Amen.

01:10:11.672 --> 01:10:12.012
- Amen.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:20.748
So, I have a game on
Friday, are you gonna come?

01:10:20.748 --> 01:10:22.884
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

01:10:22.884 --> 01:10:24.590
Well, I hope you do.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:31.693
Have you decided on what you
wanna do with your music?

01:10:31.693 --> 01:10:34.962
- I don't know, I mean,
growing up I always thought

01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:37.931
I'd be doing something to
worship God with my music

01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:42.737
but now, after all that's
happened, I'm just not sure.

01:10:42.737 --> 01:10:45.573
I'm not entirely sure I
even wanna keep singing.

01:10:45.573 --> 01:10:47.708
- But Faith, you have
such an amazing gift.

01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:50.712
I don't think you realize how
your music affects people.

01:10:50.712 --> 01:10:54.849
- I love God but I'm just not
sure that people care anymore.

01:10:54.849 --> 01:10:57.618
So many have pulled away,

01:10:57.618 --> 01:11:00.387
all the awful things I've
seen these past few weeks.

01:11:00.387 --> 01:11:02.890
- But that's a reason why to
use your God-given talent.

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:04.493
- I don't know.

01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:08.662
- I have an idea, why
don't you grab some friends

01:11:08.662 --> 01:11:10.765
and put a concert
on at the school?

01:11:10.765 --> 01:11:13.702
- A Jesus concert,
who would come?

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:17.873
- I'll take care of that,
you just get ready to sing.

01:11:19.873 --> 01:11:22.747
(chattering)

01:11:25.747 --> 01:11:27.881
(light dramatic music)

01:11:27.881 --> 01:11:30.576
(phone ringing)

01:12:28.576 --> 01:12:30.945
- God, it's been a while.

01:12:31.945 --> 01:12:33.682
I hardly know what to say.

01:12:35.682 --> 01:12:36.623
I need your help.

01:12:42.623 --> 01:12:45.096
God, I'm sorry for
all that I've done.

01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:51.170
I tried to do everything right.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.806
Look what it's got me.

01:12:58.806 --> 01:13:00.679
I lost my wife, my daughter,

01:13:04.679 --> 01:13:06.954
and now I'm here all alone.

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:15.064
All I have is my job.

01:13:24.064 --> 01:13:25.234
Please help me, God.

01:13:27.234 --> 01:13:30.984
Please help me find
my daughter, please.

01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:47.729
(light dramatic music)

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:56.831
- Roger, I thought you
were coming home hours ago.

01:13:56.831 --> 01:13:57.966
- Chill out, I'll be home later.

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.667
- No, you're coming home now.

01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:01.970
- I said I'll be home
later, don't piss me off.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.805
- I'm not living
like this anymore.

01:14:03.805 --> 01:14:06.507
It's either this or it's us

01:14:06.507 --> 01:14:09.744
and I'm praying you choose us.

01:14:10.744 --> 01:14:12.823
I'm going home.

01:14:21.823 --> 01:14:23.056
- You're doing what?

01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:25.560
- Putting on a
concert at school.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.860
- Who put you up to that?

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.896
- Oh, some guy.

01:14:28.896 --> 01:14:30.599
- Oh, a boyfriend?

01:14:31.599 --> 01:14:33.701
- No, not a boyfriend.

01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:35.168
- Sounds like you're doing
pretty well for yourself,

01:14:35.168 --> 01:14:37.838
new school, new boyfriend.

01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:40.041
- Anyways, we're
planning this concert

01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:42.944
and I was wondering,
do you guys want in?

01:14:42.944 --> 01:14:43.978
- I'm in.

01:14:43.978 --> 01:14:46.180
- Faith, you know I'll be there.

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:48.783
- I'll be there too, Faith.

01:14:48.783 --> 01:14:49.751
- Have you been
there the whole time?

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.085
- Hush, Nevaeh.

01:14:51.085 --> 01:14:53.587
Now Faith, what's this
boyfriend I hear about?

01:14:53.587 --> 01:14:54.956
- Give it back.

01:14:54.956 --> 01:14:57.292
- [Girl] Does he have
a little brother?

01:14:57.292 --> 01:15:00.005
(light dramatic music)

01:15:11.005 --> 01:15:13.944
- God, please help me.

01:15:16.944 --> 01:15:20.685
I have nowhere to go
and no one wants me.

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.092
(crying)

01:15:32.092 --> 01:15:35.945
(light dramatic music)

01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:53.083
- I'm home.

01:15:56.083 --> 01:15:58.219
- Roger, what are you doing?

01:15:58.219 --> 01:15:59.686
You told me to come home.

01:15:59.686 --> 01:16:02.189
- That was hours
ago, you're drunk.

01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:04.826
- Ah, here comes the priest.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.694
You here to tell me
I'm going to hell?

01:16:07.694 --> 01:16:09.130
- Roger, that's enough.

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:11.164
- I say when it's enough.

01:16:11.164 --> 01:16:12.766
You know, there is no God.

01:16:12.766 --> 01:16:14.101
You know how I know?

01:16:14.101 --> 01:16:18.038
Because I got you instead
of my own baby girl

01:16:18.038 --> 01:16:20.140
and if there is
a God, he's cruel

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.710
because now you're here,
living in my house,

01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:25.078
eating my food, trying
to change my life.

01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:27.114
- I didn't try to
change anything.

01:16:27.114 --> 01:16:28.850
- Take my wife to church,

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.885
messing with the
old bag next door.

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:32.386
- I was just trying to help.

01:16:32.386 --> 01:16:35.791
- Stop trying,
you're not helping.

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:38.760
Every day that I
have to see your face

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.130
reminds me of the
daughter I lost.

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.032
That's how I know
there's no God.

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:45.298
- I don't know what
you want from me.

01:16:45.298 --> 01:16:46.333
- Get out of my house!

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:47.046
- Roger!
- Go!

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:01.248
(light dramatic music)

01:17:35.248 --> 01:17:37.297
(crying)

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:51.800
- Wait!

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.235
Listen, I don't know what
you've been going through

01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:57.805
but this isn't the answer.

01:17:57.805 --> 01:17:59.239
- You don't know me.

01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:03.945
- I've seen you around, I've
been wanting to help you

01:18:04.945 --> 01:18:08.783
and my Mom used to
tell me before she died

01:18:08.783 --> 01:18:11.284
that one small
gesture or kind word

01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:14.087
can change someone's life.

01:18:14.087 --> 01:18:16.289
I know you may
feel lost right now

01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:19.063
but there's a God
and he loves you.

01:18:22.063 --> 01:18:24.532
He's the one that
directed me to help you.

01:18:24.532 --> 01:18:26.434
It's because of his love for you

01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:28.202
that led me here tonight.

01:18:28.202 --> 01:18:29.503
- You really believe that?

01:18:29.503 --> 01:18:30.105
- Yes, I do.

01:18:32.105 --> 01:18:35.376
And even though we don't
understand it sometimes,

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:38.279
God is at work in
our lives every day

01:18:38.279 --> 01:18:42.048
to sow his plan
that he has for us.

01:18:42.048 --> 01:18:44.318
You must be hungry.

01:18:44.318 --> 01:18:48.555
How about we grab something
to eat and talk, my treat.

01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:49.126
- Sure.

♪ Glimpse of glory

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:24.573
- Thank you, God.

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.442
Thank you for Jade.

01:22:28.442 --> 01:22:30.644
If it means saving her life,

01:22:30.644 --> 01:22:34.515
coming to this
city was worth it.

01:22:34.515 --> 01:22:37.118
And thank you for my friends,

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:41.490
Samantha and Nevaeh, they're
always there when I need them,

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:46.426
even if they're hours away.

01:22:46.426 --> 01:22:49.631
And Michael, thank you for him.

01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:56.670
He's given me hope
that I thought I lost.

01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:59.376
And lastly, thank
you for my parents.

01:23:02.376 --> 01:23:07.547
Thank you for the time I
got to spend with them.

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:10.350
Thank you for the lessons
I learned from them

01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:13.823
that help me, even
now that they're gone.

01:23:15.823 --> 01:23:17.524
Thank you for
helping me understand

01:23:17.524 --> 01:23:20.529
that they're always with me.

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.431
Tell them I love them.

01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:26.335
Just tell them for me.

01:23:28.335 --> 01:23:31.439
Thank you for never
leaving me, God.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:32.810
Thank you.

01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:39.595
(phone vibrating)

01:23:54.595 --> 01:23:56.296
- I'm sorry I took
so long to get you.

01:23:56.296 --> 01:23:59.733
Roger, I was trying
to calm him down.

01:23:59.733 --> 01:24:01.268
- How is he?

01:24:01.268 --> 01:24:04.604
- He's passed out on the couch.

01:24:04.604 --> 01:24:07.376
He will feel it
tomorrow, though.

01:24:09.376 --> 01:24:11.145
- What was he talking about?

01:24:11.145 --> 01:24:13.315
He said he lost his baby girl.

01:24:15.315 --> 01:24:18.551
- Your mother had a hard time
getting pregnant with you.

01:24:18.551 --> 01:24:20.354
- I've heard that.

01:24:20.354 --> 01:24:21.490
- I had problems, too.

01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:28.162
And finally, after what
seemed like forever of trying,

01:24:28.162 --> 01:24:33.701
I got pregnant and two weeks
later, Carol got pregnant, too.

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.804
- I didn't know that.

01:24:36.804 --> 01:24:38.805
- Me and your mother thought
it was the best thing

01:24:38.805 --> 01:24:40.444
that could ever happen.

01:24:43.444 --> 01:24:45.746
For the kids to grow
up and be best friends,

01:24:45.746 --> 01:24:50.520
just like we were but our
little daughter didn't make it.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.158
(light dramatic music)

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.561
- I'm so sorry.

01:25:01.561 --> 01:25:03.663
- It's not your fault

01:25:03.663 --> 01:25:07.636
and as much as Roger
says it is, it's not.

01:25:09.636 --> 01:25:12.407
It's just hard to look at you

01:25:13.407 --> 01:25:16.578
and think of what
could have been.

01:25:18.578 --> 01:25:22.515
That's why Roger is
the man he is today

01:25:22.515 --> 01:25:24.485
and the woman I am.

01:25:25.485 --> 01:25:28.322
We never let it go
and we blamed God

01:25:28.322 --> 01:25:30.725
for the loss of our daughter.

01:25:32.725 --> 01:25:35.530
I wasn't sure
about you moving in

01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:40.234
but when I saw you
help our neighbor

01:25:40.234 --> 01:25:43.673
and you took food to
the girl in the park,

01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:50.648
you didn't stop living but
we did, we stopped living.

01:25:54.648 --> 01:25:57.752
- It's not too late, Aunt Pam.

01:25:58.752 --> 01:26:01.654
- I can't apologize to Carol.

01:26:01.654 --> 01:26:04.960
And Roger, he's so far gone.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.796
I don't think I'll
ever get him back.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:11.698
- You have to have faith.

01:26:11.698 --> 01:26:14.680
- I have Faith,
she's right here.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.802
(groaning)

01:26:49.802 --> 01:26:53.831
(light dramatic music)

01:27:17.831 --> 01:27:18.408
- Pam?

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:28.716
Pam?

01:27:35.716 --> 01:27:36.966
Faith?

01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:54.702
- Hey Caleb, what are
you doing this weeekend?

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.569
- I don't know, me and the
boys might go to the mall.

01:27:56.569 --> 01:27:57.970
- That sounds fun,
you wanna go, too?

01:27:57.970 --> 01:27:59.472
- Yeah, we should totally go.
- I think we should.

01:27:59.472 --> 01:28:01.444
- I might hit y'all up.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.877
But I'll catch you all later.

01:28:04.877 --> 01:28:06.372
- Alright.
- Bye.

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:32.672
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:28:32.672 --> 01:28:37.543
- Wait, I heard you
sing in the music hall.

01:28:37.543 --> 01:28:38.947
It was fantastic.

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:40.881
- You were the one
that sang at church

01:28:40.881 --> 01:28:42.916
the other week, right?

01:28:42.916 --> 01:28:44.417
You did really good.

01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:45.819
- Yeah, you should join
the music club here.

01:28:45.819 --> 01:28:47.854
We could really use your talent.

01:28:47.854 --> 01:28:48.689
- Really?

01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:49.759
- Yeah.

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:54.028
(light dramatic music)

01:29:28.028 --> 01:29:30.644
(soft piano music)

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:46.880
- I don't know what
I'm doing here.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.822
I don't even know what to do.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:55.225
- Roger?

01:29:58.225 --> 01:29:59.594
Is that you?

01:30:00.594 --> 01:30:02.064
- Ah, I was just leaving.

01:30:04.064 --> 01:30:08.237
- Well if you came in here,
there must be a reason.

01:30:10.237 --> 01:30:15.208
- [Roger] I don't know
what I'm doing here.

01:30:15.208 --> 01:30:17.948
- Some people come for guidance.

01:30:21.948 --> 01:30:26.220
Roger, I've lived next
door to you for years

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:30.490
and I've never seen you
come in here before.

01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:31.560
You seem so upset.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.130
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:39.667
- I think I lost my wife.

01:30:41.667 --> 01:30:43.939
I messed up bad.

01:30:45.939 --> 01:30:48.944
- And you want forgiveness.

01:30:50.944 --> 01:30:52.012
- It's too late for that.

01:30:53.012 --> 01:30:56.550
- It's never too late
for forgiveness, Roger.

01:30:56.550 --> 01:31:00.023
That's what the love and the
grace of God is all about.

01:31:03.023 --> 01:31:05.958
- I don't even know
if I believe in God.

01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:10.264
- So, you came in here,
set down in this pew,

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:15.068
in this sanctuary,
trying to convince me

01:31:15.068 --> 01:31:17.309
to convince you otherwise?

01:31:22.309 --> 01:31:25.018
No, Roger, God is
all about forgiveness

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:34.555
and I think that's
why you came in here.

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:37.761
This is the perfect
place to find it.

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.762
(breathing heavily)

01:31:42.762 --> 01:31:45.712
May I pray for you
and your family?

01:31:59.712 --> 01:32:02.850
- I'm so sorry, I can change.

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:07.025
I promise you, I will change.

01:32:13.025 --> 01:32:14.360
(students chattering)

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.099
- Hey, you should
come to the concert.

01:32:19.099 --> 01:32:22.668
Y'all should come
to the concert.

01:32:22.668 --> 01:32:25.939
- Oh no, we are
not going to this.

01:32:25.939 --> 01:32:26.907
- What are you doing
this weekend, Michael?

01:32:26.907 --> 01:32:28.240
- I don't know--

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.890
- Hey, you should come
to the concert, you too.

01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:46.960
- [Girl] This place is huge.

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.029
- Yeah, do you think we should
have tried someplace smaller?

01:32:49.029 --> 01:32:50.396
- Michael took care of it.

01:32:50.396 --> 01:32:52.666
This is the first time
I've seen it, too.

01:32:52.666 --> 01:32:55.101
- Do you guys think we'll
be singing to an empty room?

01:32:55.101 --> 01:32:56.636
- If that's what we have to do.

01:32:56.636 --> 01:32:57.970
- How much longer?

01:32:57.970 --> 01:33:00.106
- Just a few more minutes.

01:33:00.106 --> 01:33:03.676
- Remember, we do this for
his praise, not theirs.

01:33:03.676 --> 01:33:04.011
We glorify him with our songs,

01:33:05.011 --> 01:33:08.114
regardless of how
many people show up.

01:33:08.114 --> 01:33:09.716
Well, let's pray.

01:33:09.716 --> 01:33:11.784
(light dramatic music)

01:33:11.784 --> 01:33:14.320
Dear God, thank you
for your goodness,

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.390
your mercy, and your grace.

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:19.826
Help us carry these wonderful
gifts in our own hearts.

01:33:19.826 --> 01:33:23.130
May your will be done, even
if we can't see your plans.

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:27.234
Lead us, even if we don't
understand where we're going.

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:30.103
Thank you for bringing
us where we stand today,

01:33:30.103 --> 01:33:32.238
here on this stage.

01:33:32.238 --> 01:33:34.774
We will glorify
you with our songs.

01:33:34.774 --> 01:33:37.043
We will sing our
heart's desires.

01:33:37.043 --> 01:33:39.050
In your name, we pray, Amen.
