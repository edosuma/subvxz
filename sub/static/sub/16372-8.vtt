00:02.080 --> 00:03.719
<i>Previously on The Blacklist:</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:05.917
- Enter the code.
- Reddington's looking...

00:06.080 --> 00:09.994
...for a mysterious blood doctor
doing research into gene sequencing.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.720
- You're Raymond Reddington.
- And you're in my debt.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.633
The plan is already in motion.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.439
Men are coming, Elizabeth.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.071
Men who kill every living thing
that gets in their way.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.438
Tell Harold,
and then you get out of that hospital.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.229
Okay, cameras up.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.189
When you engage, you have
a four-minute window for extraction.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.478
Colonel Wright ordered a dialysis.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.120
Can't let you in without a scan.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.840
<i>- Okay, Viktor, someone's coming.
- Can I help you?</i>

01:00.960 --> 01:02.235
Four minutes, and counting.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.517
Is it true, the DNA test?
You're not Kirk's daughter?

01:06.680 --> 01:08.990
Tell your team
to expect a full military assault.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.391
- What?
- Just got off the phone with Reddington.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.553
He has reason to believe
Kirk's men are coming to break him out.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.796
Call it off.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.520
You talked to Reddington.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.439
He's the only one
who works you up.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.111
If you try to escape,
innocent people will die.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.554
Secure area on the left.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.750
Incendiaries are live.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.110
<i>If you could get out, what's the point?
You're sick.</i>

01:59.280 --> 02:00.350
You can help me, Masha.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.911
I know you don't wanna believe this,
but those test results...

02:04.080 --> 02:08.312
- They were altered by Reddington.
- No, they're real. I'm not your daughter.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.795
Reddington wants me dead, Masha.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.713
- He always has.
- Maybe. I don't know.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.951
But I do know that I can't save your life.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.794
And you aren't going anywhere.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.070
You're wrong.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.158
<i>We're leaving here together,
solnishko.</i>

02:22.320 --> 02:23.515
No arguments.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.159
<i>- Agent Keen.
- May I have your attention please?</i>

02:29.320 --> 02:33.155
<i>There has been a fire emergency
reported in the building.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:36.631
<i>While this is being verified,
please leave the building...</i>

02:38.440 --> 02:40.272
<i>- Our people are on site.
- Copy that.</i>

02:41.880 --> 02:44.156
<i>May I have your attention please?</i>

02:44.320 --> 02:46.551
The fire is to help Kirk break out.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.951
Tell your people
no one in or out of this wing.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.113
- What's hospital protocol?
- Evacuation and/or containment.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.715
This ward is designed
to go into emergency lockdown.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.155
Has anyone seen Tom?

02:56.360 --> 02:58.511
- Come on, let me in. My wife's in there.
- Can't.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.912
You know me. I've been in and out.
I just went to get coffee.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.878
Sorry, we have orders.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.152
Well, you're letting these guys in, right?

03:10.360 --> 03:12.272
<i>May I have your attention please?</i>

03:13.120 --> 03:14.190
Doesn't make sense.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.919
- What doesn't?
- Why start a fire?

03:16.080 --> 03:20.040
It only initiates hospital protocol,
making it even harder to get inside.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.271
<i>- Reddington.
- You're still at the hospital.</i>

03:22.440 --> 03:24.238
I told you, you need to get out now.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.720
They're already inside.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.158
Blow it. Now. Go.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.833
Get down!

04:04.200 --> 04:07.159
Ready? One, two, three.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.714
Go, go! Get out! Out! Out! Come on!

04:25.680 --> 04:27.114
Go!

04:33.320 --> 04:34.640
Get Kirk out.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.916
<i>Go now.</i>

04:44.560 --> 04:47.075
- Drop your weapon. Put it down.
- You put it down.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.431
Leave him. We're only here for Masha.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.558
- Liz!
- Tom!

04:56.080 --> 04:58.800
- Liz!
- Tom!

04:59.480 --> 05:01.676
She cannot hear you, my friend.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.473
Are you saying something?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.233
I still cannot hear you.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.198
<i>Keep moving, keep moving.</i>

05:20.360 --> 05:23.114
Inside! Go, go, go! Go!

05:24.360 --> 05:25.714
Go!

05:29.840 --> 05:31.069
<i>Leave him. Go now.</i>

05:35.120 --> 05:37.635
Hey, hey, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.520
Sorry.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.713
<i>You've told me you've always wanted
a pristine, unspoiled place...</i>

05:54.880 --> 05:56.758
<i>...to live out your days in peace.</i>

05:56.960 --> 05:58.030
<i>So the acre is yours...</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:00.000
<i>...for all eternity.</i>

06:01.160 --> 06:02.719
Raymond.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.037
Fever broke.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.560
I think we beat that infection.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.919
So who's Raymond?

06:13.240 --> 06:17.075
He the one that shot you?
Or the other guy?

06:25.560 --> 06:27.313
Which one?

06:31.200 --> 06:34.318
I don't know why
you're protecting these people.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.110
Truth is, I don't care.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.633
You're not leaving me
a lot of options here, sweetheart.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.510
Can't hold you prisoner forever.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.273
So let me go.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.716
This here's a squat.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.155
Public land.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.789
Rangers would run me off if they knew.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.518
Nobody knows I'm here but you.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.480
You don't trust me.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.554
So how am I supposed to trust you
with my whole world?

07:04.960 --> 07:08.271
This would've been
a hell of a lot easier...

07:08.440 --> 07:12.673
...if you'd been considerate enough
to die on your own.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.390
<i>- We're 10 minutes out. Got eyes on Kirk?
- Aram's trying to locate the vehicle.</i>

07:37.600 --> 07:40.115
<i>- Where are you on Dr. Shaw?
- Reddington got to her.</i>

07:40.280 --> 07:42.078
If Shaw knows how to cure Kirk...

07:42.240 --> 07:44.152
...Reddington has made sure
that's not going to happen.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.879
<i>Which means Liz is his only hope.</i>

07:46.040 --> 07:48.919
Kirk's not gonna hurt her
as long as he needs her stem cells.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.278
But he doesn't. The hospital
ran DNA tests, they're not related.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.357
It was Kirk's men at the hospital.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.160
- Did Elizabeth get out?
- She was taken by Kirk.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.430
She'll be safe with him until Kirk's
doctors confirm she's not his daughter.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.479
But we don't have much time.
We need to find patient zero.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.630
How long, Dr. Shaw?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.400
It might help if I knew
what you needed the patient for.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.279
My agenda has no bearing
on your task.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.671
You know what you're looking for.
I need it now.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.958
I've treated hundreds of patients.
This is going to take some time.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.998
I'm out of time, doctor.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.879
Which means you're out of time.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.190
Find the patient.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.438
You're angry, and I accept that.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.352
Tom better not be dead.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.558
In time, you'll understand
I did this to hold my family together.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.234
He better not be dead.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.357
The test, Reddington falsified it.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.876
He'll do anything to keep us apart.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.040
We're approaching the switch site.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.352
- Medical teams are waiting.
- Tom Keen. Make sure he's not hurt.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.920
I'm not giving you my blood.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.914
You will help me, Masha.
One way or another.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.070
Agent Mojtabai.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.192
Aram, I'm following Liz.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.194
She's in an ambulance
heading north on Bristoll. Hang on.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.880
Aram, the ambulance.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.636
Tracking it now. Agents Ressler
and Navabi are closing in from the west.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.320
I'm vectoring you in.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.914
<i>- Why are we slowing?
- Don't stop.</i>

09:40.080 --> 09:42.117
- You need to get to the switch car.
- Hold on.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.992
Everybody out! Let's go!

09:56.320 --> 09:57.436
Out!

10:21.320 --> 10:26.076
Hey, how's it going under there?
My boss ordered me not to kill you...

10:26.240 --> 10:29.199
...but he didn't say anything
about messing up that pretty face.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.240
- Boo.
- Okay, okay, okay.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.996
You owe me.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.713
What are you doing?

11:08.280 --> 11:10.272
Can't keep you.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.552
Can't kill you.

11:14.480 --> 11:19.316
I was gonna cut you loose and pray
you don't tell anybody I'm up here.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.634
You could've left me in the woods.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.072
No, I couldn't do that.

11:42.280 --> 11:46.240
Police found the sedan abandoned
under a bridge about a mile away.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.550
Where is this place?

11:47.720 --> 11:50.076
The bridge was well-chosen.
No surveillance cameras.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.472
- A complete dead zone.
- You had a switch vehicle stashed there.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.394
You were supposed to be in it.
We need a make and tag number.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.960
Where were they headed?

11:58.120 --> 12:02.637
Prisoners are legally guaranteed
medical care, and I've been shot.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.269
- You were treated by paramedics.
- I need a doctor.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.320
You are showing deliberate indifference to
my injuries, and that is against the law.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.394
So this where the bullet went in?

12:20.760 --> 12:22.194
This building doesn't exist.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.670
And you're not here,
and you never were.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.918
Where is Alexander Kirk?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.480
Come on.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.316
God! They had a van waiting
under the bridge. A silver panel van.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.673
The safe house was 10 minutes away,
they hadn't told me where...

12:38.840 --> 12:42.311
- ...in case of something like this.
- I don't believe you. You're lying.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.312
- I'm not.
- Come on, tell me.

12:44.480 --> 12:49.475
I don't know where.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.440
Keen was taken from the drop site
in a silver panel van.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.037
- Safe house less than 10 minutes away.
- Contact Montgomery County Police.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.591
Pull all surveillance around that area.
Local businesses, traffic cams.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.350
I'll search for properties in the area
associated with Kirk or his companies.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.796
Knock on doors,
interview street vendors...

13:10.960 --> 13:14.795
...talk to anyone who might have seen
that van. Let's find Agent Keen.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.599
<i>- I talked to Ressler.
- Tell me.</i>

13:16.760 --> 13:19.878
They've narrowed the location
where she's being held. Silver Spring.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.680
<i>- I think I found something.
- Hey, hello? Did you hear me?</i>

13:22.840 --> 13:26.436
- I need to find her, and I need your help.
- No, the FBI needs to find her.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.831
We need to focus
on keeping Elizabeth alive...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.719
<i>- ...once they do.
- What are you talking about?</i>

13:30.880 --> 13:33.349
I'll call you on this number
when I know more.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.715
I found patient zero.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.271
Call Baz. Tell him to get Dr. Reifler here
right away. Go on.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.831
Mr. Reddington, I was on the verge
of patenting cutting-edge research...

13:42.000 --> 13:43.320
...that would've saved lives.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.310
I had to restore my credentials
as a doctor...

13:46.480 --> 13:48.949
...and thanks to you,
I've lost it all again.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.794
Patient zero. I need a name.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.917
I want you to bankroll my work.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.276
I want my future back.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.040
My research is illegal, not immoral.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.271
A distinction I'm comfortable drawing.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.552
But human experimentation
in the hull of a ship...

14:04.720 --> 14:07.360
...is a bit too Draconian even for me.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.558
I need your word
that you will not kill her.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.158
Her name.

14:14.080 --> 14:18.233
The HLA proteins aren't a match.
We're not meeting the criteria.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.712
- You're a liar.
- I reviewed the results three times.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.799
How much did he pay you?

14:26.680 --> 14:30.196
- How much did he pay you?
- Sir, please.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.751
It... It's not a match.

14:36.840 --> 14:41.756
You look into my eyes, and you tell me
Elizabeth Keen is not my daughter.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.959
She's not.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.918
Dr. Reifler, I don't know about you...

14:56.120 --> 14:58.954
...but I'm experiencing
the strongest sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.191
Why are you doing this?
I told you everything.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.080
I've been locked in a motel room
with your goons for weeks.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.879
Goons? Now, that's not fair.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.750
Well, Carlton is a bit goonish,
but Matthew is actually quite erudite...

15:09.920 --> 15:11.513
...and a world-class chess player.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.440
In any case, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.997
Dr. Adrian Shaw,
meet Dr. Sebastian Reifler.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.992
Dr. Reifler is a hematologist.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.278
Dr. Shaw is a research scientist
who worked with a patient...

15:23.480 --> 15:25.597
...you also treated. Lucille Bockes.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.429
Lucille Bockes is dead.

15:27.880 --> 15:28.950
Actually, she's not.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.840
No, I... I put her on hospice care
over four years ago.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.834
I won't pretend to understand
how it all works...

15:35.000 --> 15:38.755
...but I must say
Dr. Shaw really is something of a wizard.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.231
Lucille responded to my treatment
and went into full remission.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.392
It's... It's not possible.

15:44.560 --> 15:48.998
Lucille Bockes is alive and well,
and working as a prosecuting attorney.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.470
It's Kirk.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.870
Constantin.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.680
She's not my daughter.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.320
<i>No, she's not.</i>

16:02.520 --> 16:03.840
And yet she's here.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.357
She's nothing to you.
A distant, confused memory.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.715
I'm the one you want.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.760
What I want is to put a bullet
in your head before I die.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.196
Then do that. An even trade.

16:15.360 --> 16:19.274
With the FBI wanting to ambush me
the moment I give her up?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.477
<i>- I don't think so.
- You set the terms.</i>

16:21.640 --> 16:25.111
However you want, I'll do it.
My life for hers.

16:27.080 --> 16:31.438
Rollins Park. Twenty minutes.
I'll send a car.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.436
We can find her.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.910
There's no more time.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.596
He'll kill you,
no matter what you do or say.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.399
You can't go.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.356
It's Elizabeth.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.435
If we can get the woman...

17:09.119 --> 17:12.192
It's too late for her to save Elizabeth.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.913
But perhaps she can save you.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.598
Forgive me.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.237
For Kate.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.912
For everything.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.158
The man you saw in the picture
was my employer.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.280
He lost his way.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.557
At least, that's how I saw it.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.799
He placed a lovely young woman
and her baby girl in terrible danger.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.998
Not deliberately, mind you.
He loves them deeply.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.911
Enough to blind him to the reality...

18:51.080 --> 18:55.438
...that his very presence in their lives
constitutes a threat.

18:56.360 --> 19:00.115
Not just to them but to himself as well.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.794
I tried to help her.

19:02.960 --> 19:07.193
All I managed to do was to place her
and the child in even greater danger.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.558
My efforts earned me
a bullet in the head.

19:12.480 --> 19:17.191
This man, he is very dangerous
and absolutely relentless.

19:17.360 --> 19:22.833
If he even suspects I survived,
there will be no place I could be safe.

19:23.560 --> 19:28.316
The reason I didn't tell you the truth
was not to protect him, but to protect you.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.080
It's a shame you have no crackers.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.390
I'm not ready to die...

19:52.920 --> 19:54.354
...just yet.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.597
Reddington. He's arriving.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.352
You shouldn't have come.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.637
The ripe apple falls.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.837
It doesn't know what else to do.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.912
So here I am.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.309
Time to let her go.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.756
I bear Masha no grudges.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.593
I promise a safe passage.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.800
I understand now how you see me.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.035
A dangerous man, dying...

20:55.200 --> 20:56.998
...polluted by his money.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.710
- Let him go.
- Love did it, if you can believe it.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.711
It doesn't make much sense,
but sometimes, you can feel too much.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.440
Hold on too long, it poisons you.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.478
I should've let go of you years ago...

21:11.640 --> 21:14.792
...but you were my child.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.316
I'm gonna be dead soon,
and my biggest regret is that...

21:19.480 --> 21:21.551
That you will remember me like this...

21:21.720 --> 21:25.794
...and not the young father
who cradled you in his arms...

21:25.960 --> 21:28.475
...a lifetime in front of us.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.799
You want me
to remember you that way?

21:32.520 --> 21:34.716
Let Reddington go.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.471
Hold her for an hour.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.599
Take her somewhere remote.
Leave her safe.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.639
Safe, Odette.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.678
I'll come for you. I'll come for you.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.515
You and I have much to talk about.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.718
- Excuse me. What are you doing?
- I locked my keys in the car.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.594
Yeah, I stopped to get something,
and then... Never mind.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.836
You're blocking my car.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.674
I took care of it.
A locksmith will be here in 45 minutes.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.832
I'm late for court.
This can't be happening.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.640
I called a car service.
Yeah, they're almost here.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.395
- So I'm gonna have my assistant...
- You can't just leave.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.638
I am a lawyer. I have a trial.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.917
Why don't you just take my ride?

22:22.400 --> 22:25.154
- That would be very helpful.
- Great.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.874
- Thank you.
- Sure, no problem.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.158
Yeah, I'll just... It's a black Town Car.

22:30.320 --> 22:34.360
And the driver's name
is unpronounceable.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.000
I can't even say.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.277
- Hey, you call for a ride?
- Yes. Thank you.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.274
Would you drive this young woman
wherever she'd like to go?

22:41.440 --> 22:46.310
I'm going to the county courthouse.
Chestnut and Jefferson.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.198
I'm not gonna hurt you.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.917
I don't really know
how we got here, Raymond.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.992
I remember being
an honest businessman...

22:59.160 --> 23:01.152
...in a happy marriage
until you came along.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.152
Constantin, I can save your life.

23:03.360 --> 23:07.195
Seduced my wife. To her credit, Katarina
broke it off, but you couldn't let go.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.596
- I have a cure.
- I came home one night...

23:09.760 --> 23:12.798
...and they were gone.
My wife, my child.

23:12.960 --> 23:17.193
Two-oh-two-five-five-five
- oh-one-nine-eight.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.478
- A girl who's not even my girl.
- If you wanna live, call the number.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.279
As you can imagine,
I have many questions.

23:22.440 --> 23:26.639
There's a science, some sort of genetics.
It's called CRISPR.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.031
Your magic bullet to save my life...

23:30.200 --> 23:33.398
...is some experimental treatment
they're not even testing on humans.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.074
CRISPR is not just experimental.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.519
Gene resequencing may work someday,
but I won't live that long.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.799
There was a breakthrough 19 years ago
by a scientist who was murdered.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.590
His partner carried on his work.
On humans, not animals.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.672
With remarkable success.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.560
I have a doctor
who can apply that science today.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.838
I can make her available to you.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.359
And why would you save my life?

23:57.960 --> 24:00.520
Because I want you to save mine.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.478
Call the number.

24:06.480 --> 24:10.360
Because of my chronic illness,
I've become something of an expert...

24:10.520 --> 24:15.072
...in pain management,
what causes it and what prevents it.

24:15.240 --> 24:21.760
Naturally occurring toxins,
bacterial proteins, mutagens.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.070
I'm confident Mr. Kleeb
can encourage you...

24:26.240 --> 24:28.630
...to answer some of my questions,
Raymond.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.395
As I said, I have many.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.951
Now, let's start at the beginning.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.557
We'll deliver them in one hour.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.511
The meeting is set. Same bus stop.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.315
Just the doctor and Mrs. Bockes.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.230
Where are you taking me?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.995
Just need a little blood work.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.719
Okay. All right.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.360
That was Aram. No dice.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.399
No businesses, no shell companies.
Nothing that links to Kirk.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.553
- Anything on that silver panel van?
- No. We gotta keep knocking.

25:17.720 --> 25:20.189
We never gonna find Kirk's safe house
this way.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.833
They're driving a silver panel van.
See anything like that here?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.719
No. Who are they?

25:35.880 --> 25:38.236
Did anyone enter the club
in the last hour or so?

25:38.400 --> 25:40.710
Sure. But I wouldn't have let them inside
without a membership card.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.839
- Do you mind if we take a look around?
- Fine with me.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.799
Excuse me. Ressler.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.158
All right. I'm looking at CCTV feeds
of a silver panel van...

25:50.360 --> 25:53.797
...that crossed through Newmarket
and Maiden less than five minutes ago.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.474
Aram's got eyes on the van.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.240
All right, talk to me.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.160
<i>- What is it?
- Two cops asking questions.</i>

26:05.320 --> 26:08.472
They're gone now, but I can't say
they won't be coming back.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.596
I had proof that she was my daughter.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.393
A DNA test.

26:19.360 --> 26:23.673
You saw
what Katarina wanted you to see.

26:24.320 --> 26:28.030
She lied to you. About everything.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.913
The KGB trained her to seduce...

26:33.720 --> 26:39.034
...foreign diplomats
and intelligence personnel...

26:39.240 --> 26:40.993
...into...

26:42.680 --> 26:44.717
...revea... Revealing secrets.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.558
You always thought
I was the interloper.

26:48.960 --> 26:53.159
The truth is, I was an assignment.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.239
I'm sure... I'm sure you were too.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.470
That's a lie.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.470
A cover then.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.798
Well, you were wealthy and powerful.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.634
Gave her access.

27:04.800 --> 27:09.079
All that matters is that we had a family,
and you destroyed it.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.312
We had a daughter,
and you took her from us. Why?

27:15.880 --> 27:19.999
If I dose him again,
it could induce an adrenergic storm.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.192
We could lose him.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.552
Are you her father?

27:44.760 --> 27:47.355
Are you her father?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.872
Answer me.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.640
- Let's go.
- What good is killing me gonna do?

27:58.800 --> 28:02.111
It won't bring him back.
He's gonna die. He can't be saved.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.915
Well, he wouldn't need to be saved
if it wasn't for you.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.873
Come on, up. Up.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.514
He's dying because he's sick.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.673
I'm not talking about his death,
that was inevitable.

28:11.840 --> 28:16.960
I'm talking about who he's become
because of his obsession with you.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.589
He was a good man when I met him.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.711
And then he saw you,
a fugitive on television.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.395
Finding you, that changed him.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.196
He did things that I didn't think
he was capable of.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.077
Terrible things. Awful.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.630
I blame you for that.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.595
You're going to jail.

29:03.640 --> 29:07.031
No. I'm not.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.799
His heart rate is 122.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.429
BP is 180 over 110.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.273
We made him tachycardic.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.040
The antidote.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.196
Pain.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.075
Release.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.711
Which I administer next
is completely up to you.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.834
So be it.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.476
I don't know what this is,
or why I'm here...

29:55.800 --> 29:58.838
...but I'm a district attorney,
and people will be looking for me.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.118
- Who is she?
- She is a miracle.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.313
- Lucille was a patient of mine.
- Lucille Bockes.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.040
- That's not possible.
- I know.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.800
What trick are you playing?

30:10.960 --> 30:12.872
It's no trick.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.751
It's proof of concept.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.835
- CRISPR.
- It can save you.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.599
If I let you go...

30:28.240 --> 30:30.436
We both die...

30:31.040 --> 30:33.555
...or we both live.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.193
It's up to you.

30:42.080 --> 30:46.120
Run every test on her you can think of.
I don't believe in miracles.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.835
You're telling me
that Reddington was there with Kirk?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.196
Yeah. He traded himself for me.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.751
- Some kind of underground parking lot?
- There no signs, no markers.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.958
- They had my head covered, in and out.
- Any idea how close it is?

30:58.120 --> 31:00.680
I'd say we drove 15,
maybe 20 minutes.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.196
Ten-mile radius?
We're back to where we started.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.990
No, we're not. I have an idea.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.038
<i>- Yeah.
- Aram, I have a question.</i>

31:09.200 --> 31:12.637
If the van Kirk's guys were using
has a GPS system...

31:12.800 --> 31:15.076
...could you use that
to retrace where it's been?

31:15.240 --> 31:18.711
If the van has a telematics system,
it may have a two-way link...

31:18.880 --> 31:21.190
...to a service provider
that relays GPS data.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.120
Okay, I'm at the van.
What do you need to make that happen?

31:24.280 --> 31:27.751
Maybe she's a miracle.
Maybe she's not a miracle.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.913
Either way, you're gonna have
to answer my question.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.396
No.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.679
- You're not her father?
- No, I'm not gonna answer your question.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.193
It doesn't matter.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.275
She lived at your house...

31:45.440 --> 31:47.432
...as your daughter...

31:49.520 --> 31:53.355
...on and off for four years.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.913
Sometimes, you were there,
sometimes, you weren't.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.198
What difference does it make?

32:00.360 --> 32:02.556
Are you her father?

32:03.040 --> 32:05.236
Sam Milhoan raised her after that.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.671
Are you her father?

32:07.840 --> 32:09.399
It doesn't matter.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.313
I can't.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.392
If I inject him again...

32:16.920 --> 32:19.151
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.233
Is Masha your daughter?

32:33.960 --> 32:35.792
What do you want me to say?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.554
Yes, she is.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.031
Is that what you want me to say?

32:48.440 --> 32:51.399
Yes, Elizabeth is my daughter.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.232
- It's true?
- Yes.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.796
I did a full work-up.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.193
She's cured.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.077
My proposition still stands.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.597
- How?
- What does it matter how?

33:15.800 --> 33:18.474
Dr. Shaw saved my life.

33:18.680 --> 33:23.357
Dr. Shaw is standing by,
in a fully assembled lab, waiting for you.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.316
I want everybody out. Clear the area.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.199
Miss Bockes, you're free to go.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.920
All of you, go.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.156
Out!

33:49.520 --> 33:50.749
So...

33:51.960 --> 33:53.792
...you can cure me.

33:54.320 --> 33:57.870
How ironic. You, of all people.

33:58.480 --> 34:03.396
But if the price for my life
is sharing the earth with you...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.959
...I'm gonna have to turn you down.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.472
Stay on Hampden until you cross 188,
then take your next right.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.835
We don't have time
to retrace the entire route.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.437
Site had underground parking structure.
Does that help filter the search?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.638
It would, except that van covered
over 40 miles of road today.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.634
Aram, Keen said she was on the road
for 15, maybe 20 minutes.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.315
Can you narrow the route pattern
to a window of time?

34:28.480 --> 34:31.154
Determine the speed
and the number of stops...

34:31.320 --> 34:33.835
The van made eight stops
in the last 96 minutes.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.992
An apartment complex
in Friendship Heights.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.436
A gym in Bethesda.
What looks like a strip mall...

34:38.600 --> 34:40.353
Wait. Wait. Did you say "gym"?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.239
Right. Bodhi Fitness.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.232
That's the place.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.878
Since we have a history together...

34:48.560 --> 34:51.155
...I'll give you the choice.

34:51.480 --> 34:55.315
Would you prefer to suffocate...

34:55.480 --> 34:57.312
...or to have a heart attack?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.553
You're not gonna kill me.

34:59.720 --> 35:03.634
And why is that?
Because that means I'll die too?

35:03.800 --> 35:06.440
Dying isn't so bad.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.157
I did it once in Marrakech.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.595
Suffocation.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.229
You talk too much.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.760
Perhaps I should listen more.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.760
Tell me about Katarina.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.192
And why would I do that?

35:25.360 --> 35:28.751
Because we both miss her.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.592
Because...

35:34.040 --> 35:36.919
...after all these years...

35:38.920 --> 35:44.154
...I have forgotten
what she was really like.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.914
You remember what she did...

35:48.120 --> 35:50.510
...and not who she was.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.637
Remind me.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.435
When...

35:58.600 --> 36:01.479
When we... When we first met...

36:03.320 --> 36:07.155
...there was this house
near where she lived.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.039
A "case study" house...

36:09.200 --> 36:14.400
...built by this famous
mid-century architect.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.794
Over dinner, one night,
she said she wanted to look at it.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.600
I thought she meant
look from the street.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.480
But when we got there...

36:25.400 --> 36:27.357
...she jumped the fence.

36:28.200 --> 36:33.514
The lights were on,
people lived there, but she didn't care.

36:34.160 --> 36:38.200
I stood there, frozen...

36:38.440 --> 36:40.352
...angry, nervous.

36:41.480 --> 36:46.953
And then I felt this rush of exhilaration.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.836
I climbed up...

36:50.280 --> 36:52.920
...looked into the yard...

36:55.200 --> 36:56.998
...and she was just...

36:57.360 --> 36:59.317
Dancing.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.157
Unafraid...

37:02.480 --> 37:03.516
...daring...

37:04.120 --> 37:05.998
...being.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.514
I'd never seen anything like it.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.356
She had...

37:15.120 --> 37:17.715
A joy for living.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.830
She was more alive
than anyone I knew.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.760
When I heard she killed herself...

37:30.040 --> 37:32.111
...I didn't believe it.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.397
I still don't.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.154
You're wrong.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.870
I didn't see what she wanted me
to see of her.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.471
I saw her.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.955
And despite what happened...

37:48.640 --> 37:51.075
...I know she loved me.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.396
You don't have to do this.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.040
Raymond...

38:10.440 --> 38:15.469
...there's nothing in this world
you can tell me to change my mind.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.240
<i>Reddington did what?</i>

39:12.400 --> 39:15.313
We thought he kidnapped Dr. Shaw
to make sure that Kirk died.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.474
But the truth is he kidnapped her
hoping to keep Kirk alive.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.632
Data recovered
from Kirk's lab indicates...

39:21.800 --> 39:25.191
...that Reddington was trying to prove
to Kirk that Shaw could save him.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.113
- Why?
- Why does Reddington do...

39:27.280 --> 39:28.634
...any of the things he does?

39:28.840 --> 39:30.513
- And where's Kirk?
- We don't know.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.675
We're sure as hell gonna find out.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.355
So it worked.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.553
Yes.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.920
I'll take that as a "thank you."

40:51.000 --> 40:52.116
Oh, my God.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.312
How did you...?

41:09.640 --> 41:11.359
Kirk?

41:12.560 --> 41:14.119
- Gone.
- Dead?

41:14.320 --> 41:15.993
Gone.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.796
- I don't understand. How did you...?
- It's over.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.839
May I?

41:29.320 --> 41:33.360
Come here. Come here. Yes.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.399
Here you go.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.834
You know,
I really believed he was my father.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.838
You had every reason to.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.514
Except for one.

41:58.360 --> 42:04.357
You. You told me my father died
when I was a little girl. I just...

42:06.320 --> 42:08.960
I guess I didn't wanna believe it.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.791
I really wanted my dad here
to see her grow up.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.840
He would've wanted that too.
