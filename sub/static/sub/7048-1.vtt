WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:04.952
Who are these people?

00:05.505 --> 00:07.463
Raylan, who's out there?

00:08.007 --> 00:10.250
Miami gun thugs, I suspect.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.713
What do they want?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.503
Me.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.844
Is my daddy moving?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.298
No.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.939
You didn't happen to bring
your rocket launcher, did you?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.783
I didn't think to pack one.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.701
All we want is Raylan Givens!

00:37.287 --> 00:39.695
How about I come out unarmed,

00:40.415 --> 00:43.784
and you come out
unarmed and we talk?

00:45.671 --> 00:48.588
The second he clears,
you shoot him in the gut.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.957
Maybe we can get him
to Gio before he dies.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.124
Gotcha.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.803
Why don't we all just run?

00:53.929 --> 00:56.502
Well, someone's got to keep them here
for the other two to have a chance.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.636
I'll stay, then.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.640
Boyd, I'm asking you,

01:00.435 --> 01:02.309
take Ava out of here.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.055
Come on.

01:15.951 --> 01:16.982
My hands are empty.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.068
Me too.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.070
Where's your friend?

01:46.023 --> 01:47.303
Is he dead?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.472
Yeah, I think so.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.526
- Where's Ava?
- She's running through the woods.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.684
Where you going?

01:52.821 --> 01:54.861
I'm going after the young lady
with the automatic weapon.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.449
I'll get her.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.125
What are you gonna
do after you get her?

02:07.252 --> 02:08.996
I ain't quite figured that out yet.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.881
You gonna shoot to stop me?

02:12.215 --> 02:14.504
- Maybe.
- I'm pretty sure you're empty.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.214
You gonna bet your life on that?

02:18.597 --> 02:23.259
No, Raylan, I'm gonna bet my life on you being
the only friend I have left in this world.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.921
Where's your boyfriend?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.383
Which one?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.820
Holy shit.

03:26.957 --> 03:27.988
Where you headed?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.454
Cincy.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.705
Not any more.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.926
You going to kill me?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.141
- Do I have to?
- No.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.227
What's that?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.118
Boyd!

04:11.626 --> 04:13.702
How long you been following me?

04:13.837 --> 04:14.952
Truck stop.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.079
I'll take it from here, all right?

04:18.216 --> 04:20.209
I believe I got it from here, Raylan.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.249
You just gonna execute her?

04:22.387 --> 04:26.171
I wouldn't call it an execution.
More like retribution.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.718
She killed my daddy.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.138
Which is what you wanted to do.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.599
And besides, the gun thug behind the
tree killed your daddy, and I got him.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.056
Are you gonna split hairs with me?

04:37.819 --> 04:38.850
I'm just saying.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.232
Well, what's to stop me
from pulling this trigger, Raylan?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.648
That it would be a sin?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.577
Don't get me wrong.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.613
I have no moral objection
to you killing her.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.793
You understand, miss,
the life you've led.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.334
But I need her alive.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.332
And if I don't comply?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.013
Boyd, nice shot.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.398
Get my friend to a hospital.
He's been shot. Let's go.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.559
Will do.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.414
<i>You're twice as attractive
as Julia ever thought of being.</i>

05:37.546 --> 05:42.042
<i>You've got twice the looks, twice the
mind, and 10 times the quality.</i>

05:42.717 --> 05:43.915
<i>What do you mean?</i>

05:56.982 --> 05:58.262
My God, she needs a doctor.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.900
She's needed one for a while,

06:00.026 --> 06:01.983
but I don't think these next
two minutes are gonna kill her.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.483
What do you want?

06:03.697 --> 06:08.026
What I did, the way I killed your man,
Tommy Bucks,

06:08.368 --> 06:11.285
I understand you feel like
you need to come after me.

06:11.663 --> 06:16.076
Trouble is, there are people I care about
that are getting caught in the crossfire.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.169
So, this ends right here, right now.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.475
What would you give me in return?

06:34.269 --> 06:37.472
You leave me alone,
and we will leave her alone.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.845
You have my word.

06:39.858 --> 06:40.854
I need more.

06:41.359 --> 06:45.108
Well, I'd give you more, but everyone
else you've sent my way is dead.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.902
Let's go, Gio. She needs a doctor.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.992
I need guarantees about my business.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.031
All right, look.
I've tried to be reasonable.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.243
You give me your word in 10 seconds,
or I shoot you in the head.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.000
Just... Time-out.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.378
Maybe I should...

07:11.890 --> 07:13.301
Just let it ring.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.851
<i>We can't get to the phone right now.
Leave a message. Bye!</i>

07:19.397 --> 07:20.560
<i>Raylan, I'm walking in.</i>

07:20.690 --> 07:22.564
<i>Whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't.</i>

07:23.568 --> 07:26.355
Mr. Reyes, my name's Dan Grant.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.323
I'm the chief deputy
of the Miami Marshals office.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.742
There's an ambulance on the way
for your niece.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.327
Till it gets here, we're gonna talk,

07:36.081 --> 07:37.872
the three of us, like civilised men.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.791
See if we can't work
something out, okay?

07:39.918 --> 07:41.329
Okay, let's talk.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.909
Not here.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.959
The kitchen, then.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.507
- I could use a drink.
- Not the kitchen.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.759
- In the den?
- No.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.343
And not the master bedroom,
not your office.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.766
- This far enough?
- A little further.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.731
Okay.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.439
Here's what I'm thinking.
See if this makes sense.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.323
You come after Raylan,
harm him in any way,

08:15.787 --> 08:17.067
I'll kill you myself.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.920
- Go ahead. Say it.
- I thought that went well.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.837
Okay. Get 'em up.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.292
So, Art called you?

08:34.013 --> 08:35.176
Yeah. You want to stay?

08:35.849 --> 08:39.015
You want to stay? The AUSA
has long forgotten about Tommy Bucks.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.053
O'Neill's retired. I got a slot open.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.933
I didn't think you missed me.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.306
Well, you know,
I had a wart once when I was a kid...

08:45.442 --> 08:47.518
Right. And when it was gone,
you missed it?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I get it.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.565
Wait. Hold up.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.238
Is this your idea,
or did Art suggest this?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.397
Suggest what?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.028
Shit. He did.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.031
- I owe him one.
- What for?

08:59.289 --> 09:01.281
Well, he took you off my hands,
didn't he?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.076
Dan, I went to Kentucky.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.914
I did my job, and as far as
I'm concerned, I did it well.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.583
- What's your point?
- My point is, this trouble I'm in is bullshit.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.756
- I don't understand.
- I don't know why they give us guns.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.083
Raylan,

09:14.137 --> 09:17.506
I'm trying to offer you your old job back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.137
Right now, I just want to go home
and go to bed.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.129
Disappointed?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.932
Dan says the cartel's
gonna leave you alone.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.854
Yeah. Well, I'm still gonna sit
facing the door.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.100
- What about Boyd?
- What about him?

10:52.569 --> 10:55.569
He agree to that, not gonna
run out and avenge his daddy?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.487
Well, I figured I'd talk to him tomorrow
at the hospital.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.277
Well, you're a little late for that.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.151
Slipped out in the middle of the night.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.573
Well, that's good news.
He must be feeling better.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.282
So, you want to transfer me?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.502
Honestly, Raylan,
I don't know who would take you.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.418
Everything I did, I saw no choice.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.999
You should have called for backup.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.472
Bo said if he saw anyone but me,
he'd kill Ava.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.847
And so you took Boyd?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.930
It made sense at the time.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.566
Well, you know what happens now,
don't you?

11:32.734 --> 11:35.770
We get legions of
AUSAs all up in our ass.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.935
Tim!

11:40.074 --> 11:41.450
We're gonna do the gun thing.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.906
Relinquishing a firearm
can be a very emotional moment,

11:45.038 --> 11:47.493
and there always must be
another deputy in attendance.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.624
Add in some premium alcohol,
what could possibly go wrong?

11:55.006 --> 11:56.381
Thank you.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.168
What are you going to get next?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.296
Probably the same thing.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.096
You should think about an Uzi.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.889
How'd your father get that
bullet in his arm, in the motel?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.895
I don't clearly recall.
A lot seemed to happen at once.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.802
What did Arlo say?

12:55.149 --> 12:58.898
Your father said you shot him by accident
when the bad guys started shooting.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.519
He should know.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.576
We're looking for the $20,000

13:06.703 --> 13:09.953
that the Marshals Service gave to
your father to give to Bo Crowder.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.831
Your father said he passed it on, but
we didn't find it in Crowder's things.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.249
- Arlo has it.
- You know this?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.582
I know Arlo.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.136
You guys think I stole it?

13:27.515 --> 13:30.931
Just 'cause I've shot the occasional
person doesn't make me a thief.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.728
Hey, Harlan man.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.111
You think
you might be interested in possibly...

13:42.238 --> 13:43.353
Yes.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.194
You don't even know
what I was gonna ask.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.652
Is it gonna get me out of here?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.752
So, who we going after?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.673
Jimmy Earl Dean.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.469
Three first names,
triple winner right off the bat.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.883
Sex offender, statutory rape.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.386
Got his release two weeks ago.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.433
State police got a call on the tip line.

14:12.602 --> 14:16.018
Man matching his description
was aggravating a teenage girl.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.602
Why'd you ask me to go with you?

14:19.817 --> 14:23.518
I'm not comfortable with these people.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.564
What people? Perverts?

14:29.786 --> 14:30.900
People in Harlan.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.206
Anytime I've gone to coal country,
everyone was all polite...

14:34.373 --> 14:36.081
- I'd prefer to do paperwork.
- ... "Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."

14:36.209 --> 14:40.253
Trying to keep in mind it's the
21st century and what's expected.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.171
But when the cuffs come out,

14:43.049 --> 14:45.291
then I'm a black bitch.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.508
So, you want me to help
you with my people?

14:48.638 --> 14:52.007
You know, throw 'em a pork rind
or some Ding Dongs?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.432
If you wouldn't mind.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.849
No, ma'am.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.364
Hey. You can't take those.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.361
My daddy told you two days ago
to stay away from me.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.746
I told him about you creeping up
again yesterday.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.620
You see me coming near you?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.626
I'm way over here,
and I'm gonna stay over here.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.212
- But you stop harvesting.
- Why should I?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.133
This is my daddy's weed
and my daddy's shed.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.586
- You're trespassing.
- I don't care whose shed it is.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.513
- That's not your weed.
- Not yours, either.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.468
It belongs to the folks I work for.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.842
Really? They didn't grow it.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.971
- Grown on their land.
- Grown on state land.

15:40.898 --> 15:41.930
You gonna be a lawyer now?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.021
Is this how come you
been perving on me?

15:45.945 --> 15:49.444
Now, how have I been perving on you?
Have I exposed myself?

15:49.574 --> 15:51.613
Have I made any lewd
or unwanted comments toward you?

15:51.742 --> 15:52.774
No, I have not.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.236
Well, right now
you're talking to a 14-year-old girl

15:55.371 --> 15:58.158
- you have no reason to be talking to.
- I have a reason to be talking to you.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.701
You're trying to steal something
don't belong to you.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.376
Hey! I told you to stay back.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.876
Yes, ma'am. Okay. Fine.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.499
Where's your mama?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.388
Did she die, or did she run off?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.479
You miss your mama?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.724
At your age, I imagine you do.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.851
I mean, a girl your age,
she needs somebody to talk to.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.776
It's not like
your daddy could do a good job of that.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.820
It's not like you could talk to him
about your period.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.705
You gonna be the one to talk to me
about that?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.492
- Well, I'm closer in age.
- Not by much.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.540
Come on. I just turned 30.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.714
Any man over 18 talking to me
about my period is a pervert.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.250
Shit, any man period
talking to me about my period.

16:55.306 --> 16:58.390
Period. That's funny.
You're very funny. That's good stuff.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.966
Is this gonna be your new line,

17:00.895 --> 17:02.971
how we got the same sense of humour?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.893
What's in your mind?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.815
How do you think this is gonna go?

17:09.904 --> 17:11.861
You thinking,
"Maybe we'll fight a little,

17:11.989 --> 17:14.859
"then it'll turn to wrestling and tickling
and laughing, then she'll say,

17:14.992 --> 17:17.566
"'Don't touch me there,
and then she won't stop me"?

17:20.080 --> 17:21.704
Is that how it runs in your head?

17:24.961 --> 17:28.045
You don't even know what to say now,
do you?

17:28.589 --> 17:31.923
Even me talking about wrestling and
tickling and "Don't touch me there,"

17:32.051 --> 17:34.838
it's like a spell's been cast,
and you don't want to break it.

17:36.472 --> 17:40.173
Or maybe you're just dreaming,
and you don't want to wake up.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.176
- Well, wake up!
- God damn it!

17:48.484 --> 17:49.599
I tried nice with you.

17:50.695 --> 17:51.809
Hell, I tried friendly.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.739
That didn't work, did it?

17:55.825 --> 17:58.991
You know, people ask me
why I came back here to Harlan.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.868
And I tell them it's 'cause the
Bennett boys gave me a job.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.499
But, honestly, that's not it.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.289
That's not it at all.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.800
I came back here
because of you, Loretta.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.627
Come here!

18:22.727 --> 18:23.925
Shit!

18:34.363 --> 18:35.774
He works for them?

18:37.199 --> 18:40.485
When he came by here,
he just said he was some bank man.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.912
Well, he followed me into the shed.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.989
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's wrong?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.917
I called that tip line this morning.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.622
Daddy, I told you not to do that.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.252
Don't worry. It's anonymous.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.173
All right. Well, I'll go talk to Mags.
She likes me.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.003
Retty?

19:01.599 --> 19:04.434
When you talk to her,
don't say anything about us growing.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.557
Well, with the perv working for her,
she already knows, Daddy.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.155
With our little convoy,
you listen closely enough,

19:25.289 --> 19:27.329
you could have heard toilets
flushing up and down this holler,

19:27.458 --> 19:29.285
everybody dumping their stash.

19:30.711 --> 19:34.661
Hey, you or any of your people have
any sightings of Boyd Crowder lately?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.382
No, but we're looking for him.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.174
- State police!
- Why are you looking for him?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.792
Well, you took out Bo Crowder.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.884
No. Miami gun thugs flipped his switch.
I was just a spectator.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.517
At any rate, Bo's gone.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.018
Open up, McCready.
I saw you at the window.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.232
You think Boyd's gonna try
to fill his father's shoes,

19:52.358 --> 19:54.481
take his place as the
crime lord of Harlan?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.816
What's that old saying
from science class?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.655
Nature abhors a vacuum?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.531
- What?
- Sir, I'm Trooper Tom Bergen.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.532
These are Deputy US Marshals
Brooks and Givens.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.539
They're on a detail,
looking for a sex offender.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.829
Jimmy Earl Dean.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.960
Well, what business is it of mine?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.214
Well, Mr. McCready,
you called the state tip line.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.750
The hell I did!

20:18.884 --> 20:22.633
Sir, you might have thought
it was an anonymous call, but it's not.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.970
When you call,
your name and your address pop up.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.173
On the recording you left,

20:27.309 --> 20:30.014
you said that a man from Rabbit Holler
was bothering your daughter.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.726
The fella we're looking for,
he's from Rabbit Holler.

20:34.275 --> 20:38.818
Well, I didn't call any line
or make any recording.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.021
- Is your daughter home, sir?
- No, ma'am.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.738
But you do have a daughter
who's of the same age

20:44.869 --> 20:46.446
of the girl mentioned on the tip line?

20:46.829 --> 20:47.908
Would you please leave?

20:49.123 --> 20:50.403
Sir, you change your mind,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.334
if you want to help us put away
a known and dangerous sex offender,

20:54.295 --> 20:55.493
you give us a call.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.258
Why so scared?

21:00.384 --> 21:04.797
Well, there's about 10 sets of eyes
that saw us roll up to his house.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.389
Does James Earl Dean have a job?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.674
He put something down
on his registration.

21:09.018 --> 21:12.138
- Green Mountain ATV Tours.
- Oh, shit!

21:13.063 --> 21:14.262
That's why McCready's so nervous.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.312
The guy who's perving on his daughter
works for the Bennetts.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.778
Who are the Bennetts?

21:21.906 --> 21:22.985
Hold still, still...

21:23.574 --> 21:24.737
Unless you want to bleed some more.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.405
- I am holding still!
- Well, hold stiller.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.996
Anybody want some cheese?

21:32.208 --> 21:34.496
Here. Now you can
stick on the Band-Aids yourself.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.327
I am gonna teach them a lesson.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.538
Hey, Doyle and me,
we're gonna take care of McCready.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.509
All right. Well, I'm gonna
take care of the girl.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.717
What? Loretta? What for?

21:47.223 --> 21:50.638
Seems to me she showed craftiness
and guile protecting her stash.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.091
Well, it ain't your face.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.057
Did I not tell you
that there would be booby traps?

21:55.773 --> 21:57.849
Stop by the store,
see what kind of cheese Mama got.

21:58.901 --> 22:02.519
How about you spending the 10 minutes
I'm gone cleaning up this shithole?

22:03.489 --> 22:06.609
Maybe get it from hideous
to just plain awful.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.659
Hey there, Walt!

22:14.500 --> 22:16.658
- You know why we're here?
- No.

22:17.795 --> 22:18.957
Where's Loretta?

22:19.088 --> 22:20.582
Down at your mother's store,
getting some flour.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.671
- Let's take this inside.
- All right.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.428
Look, Doyle, when I called that line,

22:29.598 --> 22:31.472
I didn't know he worked for you.
I never would've...

22:31.600 --> 22:32.881
What the hell you talking about?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.301
Called what line?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.721
Why are you here?

22:45.614 --> 22:48.188
- What the hell?
- This is more Dickie's business.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.108
I'm just standing by, make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.076
You've been planting on our land, Walt.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.577
- It's state land!
- Now, you've been planting on our land,

22:59.712 --> 23:03.081
and any planting's by our say-so,
and you did not have our say-so.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.089
I was just trying to make a living!

23:05.217 --> 23:07.459
Sally Ann's medical
about wiped me clean.

23:07.595 --> 23:10.595
Find something else,
maybe even something lawful.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.050
Hell, you could start
by selling that watch.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.386
It ain't real gold!

23:15.519 --> 23:16.978
Sally Ann gave it to me on my wedding.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.219
Walt!

23:19.189 --> 23:20.767
You gonna come after us?

23:22.610 --> 23:24.649
Maybe take a shot
while we're going to the car?

23:24.903 --> 23:25.935
I ain't stupid!

23:26.071 --> 23:28.111
Well, we're just gonna make sure.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.118
Come on, now!

23:45.382 --> 23:48.632
It's okay, Walt. Won't break the bone.
Hardly even break the skin.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.842
It's so harmless,
why don't you put your foot in it?

23:55.059 --> 23:56.304
Come on, now, Walt.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.426
Put your foot in.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.186
- The hell I will!
- Put your foot in, Walt.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.396
I swear I won't grow no more weed!

24:04.526 --> 24:06.234
Where's that bud
your Loretta took from the shed?

24:08.072 --> 24:11.026
It's behind the stereo. I wouldn't lie.

24:17.665 --> 24:18.779
What were you talking about before?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.285
- Calling what line?
- Nothing.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.747
- Put your foot in, Walt!
- No!

24:41.647 --> 24:43.604
Put your foot in, Walt.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.784
He do anything to you?

24:56.078 --> 24:58.284
I got away before he could.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.951
Did you tell your daddy?

25:04.712 --> 25:05.910
I did.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.923
How is your daddy, Loretta?

25:11.468 --> 25:14.968
He still under the cloud
from your mother's passing?

25:17.224 --> 25:18.387
Some days.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.346
Some days or most days?

25:22.771 --> 25:26.140
He taking care of you?
Keeping a proper home?

25:30.154 --> 25:32.111
He sits in his chair mostly.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.155
When he's not growing weed
without my say-so.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.828
Don't blame him.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.038
I done most of the work on that score.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.782
You should've come to me, Loretta,
straight up.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.250
We'll work something out.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.542
As for the pervert,

25:59.892 --> 26:02.809
you don't have to worry
about him no more.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.326
Sir, would you think I'm bold to inquire
what you do as your job?

26:25.793 --> 26:28.366
Well, which one's the question,
what do I think, or what do I do?

26:29.213 --> 26:31.419
Loretta, don't you know
drug enforcement?

26:31.632 --> 26:34.633
You see a man in a suit of clothes?
They come around sniffing the air.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.921
No, no, you got us wrong.
We're Marshals Service.

26:38.055 --> 26:41.720
We go around smelling flowers
till we get turned on to wanted felons.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.057
- Raylan Givens.
- Mrs. Bennett.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.312
This is Deputy Rachel Brooks.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.598
Deputy.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.685
Been away so long,
you forgot to call me Mags.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.566
I didn't want to presume.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.357
Loretta, this is Raylan Givens.

27:00.911 --> 27:04.695
He used to be a big baseball player
in high school.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.040
Now he's a Federal.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.494
Look at poor Loretta, eyes drooping,
us talking about the old days.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.800
You run along home, Loretta.
Let us ancients catch up.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.633
Can I interest you in some apple pie?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.849
I remember your apple pie.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.435
I make it 180 proof.

27:28.564 --> 27:32.063
Cut it with cider, some apple juice,
add some cinnamon and vanilla.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.568
Reach me that glass, would you?

27:34.862 --> 27:36.735
Could've done with a
pinch more cinnamon.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.818
- Cinnamon really sells the pie.
- As good as I remember it.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.285
Would you like some, ma'am?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.234
No, thank you.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.289
How's business, Mags?

27:48.250 --> 27:49.661
This place?

27:50.460 --> 27:52.453
- I get by.
- And the rest?

27:53.714 --> 27:55.124
So, that's why you're here.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.039
You go ahead and prove it.

27:57.801 --> 28:02.878
I run a store, help these poor people come
up from the holler with their food stamps.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.633
When's anybody seen
me cultivating herb?

28:05.934 --> 28:08.721
I told you, Mags, we're
not drug enforcement.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.225
As long as they got nothing on you,
we don't, either.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.392
I hear you got a good thousand acres
from here to West Virginia.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.317
What's good about it?

28:19.448 --> 28:21.736
You plant a third for the law,
a third for the thieves.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.951
What's left you sell to the dealers,
the ones making the real profit.

28:26.079 --> 28:29.994
Used to be, marijuana was the
number-one cash crop in Kentucky.

28:30.125 --> 28:34.039
Now you got all the pills,
worse even than methamphetamine.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.713
I don't have anything to do with that.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.050
I remember your granddaddy.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.926
He cooked all week and
preached on Sunday.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.559
Six years I came over to Harlan
and sold all the liquor he cooked,

28:51.688 --> 28:53.895
and we did better than fair.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.227
How is your daddy?

28:57.361 --> 28:58.903
He's at home, far as I know.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.524
I heard what happened with
the Crowders. That blew up big.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.161
- Have you seen Boyd?
- No. Why?

29:06.870 --> 29:07.985
Just need a word.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.496
You come here looking for
Boyd Crowder? That it?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.874
Hey. Hello there, cowboy.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.242
Hello, Doyle.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.540
I'm guessing this ain't a coincidence.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.464
Well, word travels.
You and your hat are famous.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.594
- Doyle, this is Deputy Rachel Brooks.
- Ma'am.

29:25.555 --> 29:26.884
So, what brings you both to our town?

29:27.808 --> 29:29.183
Raylan's looking for Boyd Crowder.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.604
- Actually, no.
- We're looking for James Earl Dean.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.515
Never trust a man
with three first names.

29:37.651 --> 29:38.931
Not this one, anyway.

29:39.069 --> 29:40.611
He some big federal fugitive?

29:40.737 --> 29:41.982
He's a sex offender.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.071
I didn't know
that was on the Marshals' purview.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.658
It got added to the plate this year.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.905
Why you looking for him here?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.281
Word is, he works for you.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.909
You think I hire sex offenders?

29:52.040 --> 29:53.499
It's not against the law.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.119
Maybe your boys hired him.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.043
I mean, not Doyle, of course,
but Coover or Dickie?

29:59.506 --> 30:01.629
Neither me nor my tads
would do such a thing.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.336
We're reefer farmers, Raylan.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.592
We don't consort with sexual deviants.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.472
I respect how you feel, Mags,

30:09.599 --> 30:10.975
and I know you love your tads,

30:11.101 --> 30:14.304
but we're gonna want to talk to them,
in your presence, if you'd like.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.189
You can invite them here,
or we'll just go hunt them down.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.402
Well, you ever get to talk to them
face-to-face,

30:20.527 --> 30:22.235
this might help ease the pain.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.027
- You sure, ma'am?
- I am.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.868
Well, if you'll excuse me.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.950
Don't take anything
without paying for it.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.871
Mama, you really are a mean, old coot.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.789
- So, is this your uniform?
- My day off.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.216
Still driving the company car, though?

30:45.343 --> 30:46.968
You think that's a misappropriation?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.720
You want to come back,
run against me?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.342
I could never do your job.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.297
I just want to say hey.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.058
You sure
this guy doesn't work for your clan?

30:56.605 --> 31:00.389
I couldn't tell you. I'm not in the
family business, as you know.

31:01.902 --> 31:04.523
- Good to see you, Raylan.
- Good to see you, too, Doyle.

31:04.821 --> 31:05.853
Ma'am.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.320
Either of you want to take anything,
go ahead.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.489
Just leave a note. I'll cover it.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.991
Maybe we will. Thank you.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.716
Raylan Givens.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.394
I seen you and your hat on the TV
some weeks back.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.434
How'd I look?

32:22.858 --> 32:24.815
Must have been official.
You weren't smiling.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.484
- That's just Coover shooting rats.
- Okay.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.779
Okay.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.818
I don't know if anyone called you,

32:35.954 --> 32:38.243
but we're looking for someone
in your employ,

32:38.874 --> 32:40.913
Jimmy Earl Dean. Is he here?

32:42.252 --> 32:43.415
Was. Took off.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.165
- When?
- Few minutes ago.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.173
For what it's worth,
I never knew he was a molester.

32:50.719 --> 32:51.798
Hell.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.968
All that shooting, that's all you got?

32:58.685 --> 33:01.721
Another one of them sons of bitches in
there, you want to take a try at it?

33:02.022 --> 33:05.058
I shot rats as a kid. Used to
chase 'em out of the shit houses.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.061
Alls you have to do is
go in the kitchen, huh?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.905
Where I know you?

33:11.781 --> 33:15.150
- Coover, this is Raylan Givens.
- So?

33:17.037 --> 33:19.029
So, he is a Federal.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.332
Well, you can ask me,
am I growing reefer,

33:26.171 --> 33:27.630
and I will tell you no.

33:34.512 --> 33:39.471
Coover, you throw a dead rat at my car,
what are you trying to tell me?

33:40.060 --> 33:42.302
Take it any way you want, Raylan.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.887
Long as you know I'm serious.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.351
You're telling me
you're a mean son of a bitch.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.896
You know how many wanted felons
have given me this look?

33:53.031 --> 33:55.569
I say a thousand, I know I'm low.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.911
Some turn ugly as I put on the cuffs.
They're too late.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.738
Some others, I swear,
they even try to draw down on me.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.829
Dickie, you hear that?

34:06.962 --> 34:09.333
- He's threatening us.
- No, he ain't.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.786
He's got a piece under his coat.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.081
And you got one in your hand,
for Christ's sake.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.498
Yeah, so does the negress!

34:14.636 --> 34:16.510
Rachel, if Coover raises
his piece, shoot him.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.346
If you'll move a step either way.

34:26.773 --> 34:30.522
Coover, put the gun down now.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.688
I said now, God damn it!

34:47.335 --> 34:49.743
Well, if you see your friend...

34:50.672 --> 34:51.751
Ex-employee.

34:52.674 --> 34:56.719
Tell him if he comes in on his own,
it's worth a lot. If not, different story.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.669
It's good to see you, Dickie.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.883
You too, Raylan. You too.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.849
You and your hat.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.409
Get up.

35:32.255 --> 35:36.668
Get up slowly, quietly,
because if you wake him,

35:37.635 --> 35:39.260
I will kill him.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.923
So, things have changed.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.469
I am no longer welcome here in Harlan,

35:45.602 --> 35:48.686
which means it's time
for a little road trip.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.314
Are you up for that, sweetheart?

35:52.317 --> 35:54.191
This is where you nod.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.071
There you go.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.647
Now, you're gonna have to ride
in the trunk for a little while.

36:00.784 --> 36:04.235
Anybody sees the two of us, they might
not understand our age difference.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.031
Or the tape. Get in.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.134
- Givens.
<i>- Listen. Our BOLO paid off.</i>

36:23.890 --> 36:26.381
Patrol clocked Dean on 75,
headed towards Tennessee.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.467
- What exit?
<i>- Passed 11 less than five minutes ago.</i>

36:29.938 --> 36:31.052
Any sign of the girl?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.685
<i>Well, he didn't get too close.</i>

36:33.066 --> 36:34.477
Didn't want to spook Mr. Dean.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.355
All right. Well, that's the smart play.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.604
If she's with him,
and we should assume she is,

36:38.822 --> 36:40.648
<i>we can't do a roadblock or a strip.</i>

36:40.865 --> 36:41.980
That's right.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.708
<i>You want me to call in some backup?</i>

36:59.718 --> 37:00.916
All right.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.175
We got this far being smart.
Let's not blow it now.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.930
You tell me if he comes back.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.551
Loretta?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.517
You all right?

37:15.692 --> 37:17.684
You kick twice if you're okay.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.063
It's all right. We're gonna get you
out of there, one minute.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.656
<i>He left something.
He's on his way out.</i>

37:25.076 --> 37:29.655
Loretta, right now I need you
to make yourself as small as possible.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.615
Hey!

37:35.378 --> 37:37.003
What the hell are you doing?

37:38.047 --> 37:39.839
What's it look like I'm doing?

37:41.134 --> 37:43.043
Are you stealing gas?

37:43.511 --> 37:46.927
Yeah. Shit. You caught me.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.968
I'm stealing gas.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.513
I don't know why I do it.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.014
It's not like I can't afford it.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.690
Yeah. Whatever. Get out of here.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.609
Can't I just have a couple gallons?

37:58.735 --> 38:00.893
Look, asshole.
I'm gonna tell you one more time...

38:03.865 --> 38:04.944
What the hell?

38:05.492 --> 38:06.571
Hey!

38:07.076 --> 38:08.321
That's it.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.285
Okay, I'm just gonna
ask you one question.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.366
Do you know how a firearm works?

38:15.001 --> 38:16.116
What?

38:16.252 --> 38:18.459
The key word in firearm is "fire."

38:19.422 --> 38:23.716
When the pin hits the cap, makes the charge
explode, meaning there's a spark,

38:23.843 --> 38:26.761
which should be of some concern
to a man soaked in gasoline.

38:28.723 --> 38:29.838
That's bullshit.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.178
That spark's too far
away from the gasoline.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.303
You didn't finish school,
did you, Mr. Dean?

38:35.355 --> 38:38.391
It's not the liquid that burns.
It's the fumes.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.731
Now, look.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.490
Normally, I would have just shot
you myself the second you pulled.

38:47.617 --> 38:51.531
But I am doing my level best
to avoid the paperwork

38:51.663 --> 38:53.620
and the self-recrimination
that comes with it,

38:53.748 --> 38:56.535
though Lord knows you're the kind
that makes it worth it and more.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.374
Come on, Jimmy.

39:01.923 --> 39:05.256
Can't we just try to end this without
you turning yourself into the human torch?

39:06.177 --> 39:07.969
You know my name.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.594
Then you know what I got in that trunk.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.428
How about I just kill her?

39:13.101 --> 39:14.595
Gasoline aside,

39:15.478 --> 39:18.562
you aim that in any direction, my
partner's gonna pop you in the head.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.985
There you go.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.892
Hey.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.229
Slow.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.441
Slow.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.630
This might hurt.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.884
Would he have really
gone up like a torch?

39:56.311 --> 39:58.884
I don't know. But it sounded good.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.815
I call it apple pie.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.356
Go ahead. Tell me what you think.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.861
It's good.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.034
It does taste like apple pie.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.663
It does, doesn't it?

40:28.009 --> 40:29.172
Loretta okay?

40:31.262 --> 40:33.718
Fine under the circumstances.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.971
Where is she at?

40:39.103 --> 40:41.060
Down the holler with a friend.

40:44.651 --> 40:49.028
When the police brought her back,
did they ask about your leg?

40:50.114 --> 40:51.395
They did.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.026
I told them that I was fixing the trap.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.318
When I was prying it
open, my leg slipped in.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.623
How about the gunshot wound?

41:04.754 --> 41:06.711
They didn't mention it.

41:10.134 --> 41:14.179
Well, Walt,
it's on account of all that I come here,

41:15.640 --> 41:18.724
brought this 'shine as a peace offering.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.727
I want Dickie to apologise to you.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.447
Right. Right.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.699
Walt,

41:46.462 --> 41:49.962
I should not have shot you in the leg
or trapped your foot.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.628
And,

41:54.220 --> 41:57.755
we could have worked something out
about you growing.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.312
It was already in the
glass, not in the jar.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.531
Why Dickie and me
can drink and be okay.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.497
It's too late now, Walt.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.950
Medicine already doing its work.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.370
Even if you got on a
helicopter right now,

42:31.132 --> 42:33.006
you'd still be past care.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.301
Why?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.260
Why do you think?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.350
Because I called that police line?

42:45.271 --> 42:48.307
You never go outside, Walt.
You know that.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.566
I didn't know he worked for you!

42:54.071 --> 42:57.986
This is the bad part, but
it doesn't last long.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.329
The mixture's all natural,
from up in the hills.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.618
All kinds of knowledge in the hills.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.376
It's something my
grandmama taught me.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.129
She learned it from her grandmama.

43:14.217 --> 43:15.462
Loretta...

43:15.927 --> 43:17.587
I'll raise her myself.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.970
Don't you think that'll
be better for her,

43:21.891 --> 43:24.382
the way it's been around here,
with you and your sadness?

43:29.065 --> 43:31.141
All the troubles of your hard life,

43:32.902 --> 43:34.645
it's all gone now.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.607
You get to know the mystery, Walt.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.617
You get to see your Sally Ann again.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.848
Find the girl.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.944
- Beer?
- Why not?

44:36.924 --> 44:38.087
So, how's work?

44:38.718 --> 44:40.461
Exhilarating. What do you think?

44:43.723 --> 44:45.550
Did you really call me here
to talk to me about work?

44:46.225 --> 44:48.017
Not unless it's exhilarating.

44:49.437 --> 44:51.809
I was starting to think
you were never gonna call me.

44:52.982 --> 44:55.473
And don't say you've been busy.
No one's that busy.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.491
- I like the ambiance.
- I pay extra for that.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.493
Did I scare you off when I said
we should get together and talk?

45:10.416 --> 45:11.447
No.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.743
Then why am I out
here breathing diesel?

45:16.964 --> 45:19.253
Last time you were in there,
you took off your wedding ring.

45:19.508 --> 45:23.257
Yeah, and as I recall,
you put up a hell of a fight.

45:23.763 --> 45:26.633
I mean, if you really wanted to talk,
we'd have met on neutral ground,

45:26.766 --> 45:29.601
and not five feet and a flimsy door
away from that lumpy bed of yours.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.221
Okay. No.

45:31.354 --> 45:33.560
I invited you here because I'm tired,

45:33.689 --> 45:36.690
and I wanted to have a word
before I went to sleep.

45:40.655 --> 45:41.935
So, what's keeping you?

45:52.833 --> 45:54.376
Son of a bitch!

45:55.086 --> 45:59.582
Yeah, that's what a girl wants to hear
for pillow talk. Regret.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.387
- You're gonna get that?
- Givens.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.516
<i>Raylan, it's Trooper Tom Bergen.</i>

46:11.811 --> 46:13.091
Hey, Tom. What's up?

46:13.729 --> 46:15.058
Am I catching you at a bad time?

46:16.023 --> 46:17.731
- No, no, no, it's fine.
<i>- Okay.</i>

46:17.900 --> 46:20.901
<i>Well, I got a line on
Boyd Crowder for you.</i>

46:21.028 --> 46:22.357
Finally surfaced, huh?

46:22.571 --> 46:23.852
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.707
Fire in the hole!

46:42.299 --> 46:44.209
Fire in the hole!

46:44.802 --> 46:46.380
Fire in the hole!
