Zurich?

00:20.740 --> 00:22.180
I've got to find her.

00:22.181 --> 00:24.939
You awful, awful bastards.

00:24.940 --> 00:26.939
What the fuck has
happened to us all.

00:26.940 --> 00:27.940
'I love you, Rich.'

00:29.980 --> 00:31.900
She never woke up did
she from the accident?

00:31.901 --> 00:34.820
She died yesterday afternoon.

He's your son, Gran.

02:53.220 --> 02:57.699
Did he at least remember
to wish you good luck for today?

02:57.700 --> 03:01.580
No, well never mind.
You don't need any.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.099

Mine too.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.739
Be confident. Assertive.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.339
Give them a chink of light

03:41.340 --> 03:45.139
and they'll take you to
the cleaners, Boyo.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.619
Yeah, I'm used to being the new boy.
I'll get by.

03:48.620 --> 03:52.979
Here we are. Information
Communication Technology.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.779
Your first class.

03:54.780 --> 03:58.139
Pretty sure
I didn't sign up for that.

03:58.140 --> 04:02.420
Yes, your father phoned.
He changed some things around.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.460
Right.

04:09.140 --> 04:14.419
Class, this is Alex Henley.
He's new today.

04:14.420 --> 04:19.738
So go, take him to your bosoms
and show him a thundering good time.

04:19.740 --> 04:23.460
Doug. Problem with the flies.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.220
Goodness!

04:26.221 --> 04:29.779
I do apologise.
We don't want to see that, look you.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.979
There's another thing.
I'm not Doug any more.

04:32.980 --> 04:36.619
I'm also the head teacher
and that means you have to call me

04:36.620 --> 04:40.579
by my proper name
Mr Cyhoeddus-Gwalchmai.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.259

04:42.260 --> 04:45.539
Yes, all right, very amusing.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.780
All right settle down.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.458
Rich is supposed to
be my project partner.

05:46.459 --> 05:47.740
His girlfriend just died.

05:47.741 --> 05:50.619
I don't think he cares
about your fucking coursework.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.138
I suppose.

05:51.139 --> 05:53.258
He'll be back
when he's got over things.

05:53.259 --> 05:55.420
Just get Franky to do it for you.
Everyone else does.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.219
Mate, I'm really really sorry.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.580
What the fuck was that for?!

06:01.581 --> 06:03.900
It's numbers mate. Only numbers.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.139
Mini.
How long is this going to go on for?

06:27.140 --> 06:29.179
I called you four times last night.

06:29.180 --> 06:29.780
I was busy.

06:29.781 --> 06:30.859
With what?

06:30.860 --> 06:32.900
Bloody hell, Mum.
I was doing coursework.

06:32.901 --> 06:34.779
You don't need to avoid me.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.738
Why would I be avoiding you?

06:36.739 --> 06:37.618
Because you don't want
to talk about her.

06:37.619 --> 06:39.420
That's not it.

06:39.421 --> 06:42.939
Come on, Mins. We have to see each
other every day. Gracey would say...

06:42.940 --> 06:44.620
I'm not avoiding you, OK?

06:51.380 --> 06:52.420
Hey.

06:52.421 --> 06:54.179
Yeah?

06:54.180 --> 06:54.940
What's your problem?

06:56.020 --> 06:58.299
Punching people?

06:58.300 --> 06:59.058
I don't have a problem.

06:59.059 --> 07:00.580
So why did you do it?

07:00.581 --> 07:01.779
Numbers.

07:01.780 --> 07:02.860
What?

07:02.861 --> 07:05.139
If you live by this,
everything's random.

07:05.140 --> 07:08.020
So what are these numbers
telling you now?

07:22.540 --> 07:23.780
Alex.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.819
Liv.

07:26.820 --> 07:29.299
Pleased to meet you.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.659
I never even knew this was here.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.620
I only live, like, 200 yards away.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.339
Yeah. It's funny what you see
and what you don't see.

07:36.340 --> 07:37.740
Like you and your friend
aren't speaking to each other.

07:37.741 --> 07:39.699
What?

07:39.700 --> 07:43.579
And why you're pouring a quarter of
whisky into your coffee before noon.

07:43.580 --> 07:44.700
I'm an alkie.

07:44.701 --> 07:46.019
I'm a psycho.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.818
With a magic dice.

07:47.819 --> 07:49.319
Everything about me's magic.

07:50.140 --> 07:53.139
Yeah, you should try it ...
keeps things buzzy.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.260
You reckon?

07:54.261 --> 07:57.420
What was the name
of your friend that died?

07:59.300 --> 08:00.500
Grace.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.779
You want to meet the wicked witch?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.700
Hello? Gran?

08:26.260 --> 08:28.299
She'll be here somewhere.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.939
She does exist, right?

08:29.940 --> 08:32.059
Pretty sure she does, yeah.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.899
Hello, Alex.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.380
Are you wanting to come
out of there or...?

08:42.860 --> 08:44.980
No. I'm fine where I am.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.540
I was joking.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.340
Sure, Gran.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.819
I must have got a bit confused.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.740
This is Liv.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.819
She's a girl.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.739
Yep, that's right. She's a girl.

09:06.740 --> 09:10.180
I like the colour of you.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.260
Thank you.

09:15.500 --> 09:19.660
Beans for three. There you go, Gran.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.259
Very handsome. Wouldn't you say?

09:26.260 --> 09:27.779
Of course I am.

09:27.780 --> 09:33.099
It's the cheekbones. He gets them
from his Grandad William.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.220
He was an extremely virile man.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.419
Right.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.579
I was only 13 when I met him.

09:42.580 --> 09:45.499
You were 23, Gran.
Don't go overboard.

09:45.500 --> 09:49.139
Yes. There was a dance.

09:49.140 --> 09:54.299
He was all dressed up in uniform.

09:54.300 --> 09:58.739
He comes over, with a shiny penny
in his right hand.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.739
He throws it up, catches it.

10:00.740 --> 10:01.940
And he says...

10:03.100 --> 10:07.299
Heads ... we have a dance
then we go our ways.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.699
Tails ... you come with me

10:09.700 --> 10:14.219
and we'll get wed at Dover
as soon as you like.

10:14.220 --> 10:15.779
And you married him?

10:15.780 --> 10:20.260
Well, I screwed him senseless
for quite a while.

10:22.780 --> 10:26.779
You know, they're
going to put me in a home.

10:26.780 --> 10:30.579
Alex is packing my things away,
getting me ready.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.540
Why are they putting you in a home?

10:33.740 --> 10:35.380
Because I'm losing my mind.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.619
Alex is doing
a nasty little job for his dad.

10:39.620 --> 10:42.099
I'm just trying
to look after you, Gran.

10:42.100 --> 10:48.780
Yes, well, tell your dad to keep his
poisonous little hands off my house.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.820
You better go.

11:04.300 --> 11:08.059

a glass of coke...

11:08.060 --> 11:09.100
That's about Â£3.50.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.779

17:31.460 --> 17:34.339
Alex. How's it going, you all right?

17:34.340 --> 17:37.220
Good to see you again.
Usual table, yeah?

17:39.220 --> 17:40.859
You know how to play cards?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.019
No.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.380
Shit. That makes two of us.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.060
Right, then.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.140
Rock'n'roll.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.180
Ace flush.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.820
Full house.

18:51.020 --> 18:53.019
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

18:53.020 --> 18:54.220
What's going on?

18:54.221 --> 18:57.459
They just want to make me a cake.
Celebrate my victory.

18:57.460 --> 18:59.019
He says you're a cheat.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.139
No, no. Not a cheat.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.779
A fucking cheat.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.459
Well, obviously,
I'll take issue with that.

19:05.460 --> 19:06.939
No!

19:06.940 --> 19:10.659
Now, look,
you're scaring my girlfriend.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.579
I don't suppose you know kung fu?

19:12.580 --> 19:13.780
No.

19:13.781 --> 19:15.499
Dear.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.380
You're a fucking tosser.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.380
I'll tell you what.
Let's play tossers, eh?

19:23.700 --> 19:28.299
Call it, go on.
Call tails, I dare you.

19:28.300 --> 19:32.499
For the money?
Then we can part as friends, yeah?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.420
Tails.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.700
Collect the money, Liv.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.780
Run.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.939
Fuck.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.540
You're just...

20:30.541 --> 20:31.819
I'm a cheat.

20:31.820 --> 20:35.339
Yeah. You're a fucking cheat.

Jesus!

20:45.940 --> 20:49.219
Shit, sorry. I've got to...

My gran, you know?

20:50.660 --> 20:52.660
Taxi's on me.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.459
Here, er, take some of this.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.700
OK, but...

21:00.701 --> 21:03.700
I've had a lovely time.
See you at college, yeah?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.419
Alex...

21:10.420 --> 21:12.739
you don't have to be shy.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.020
I know.

21:17.820 --> 21:19.140
Take care, yeah?

22:08.100 --> 22:11.299
You need to update your profile pic.

22:11.300 --> 22:15.459
It was a little while back.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.780
In a galaxy far, far away. Yeah.

22:21.180 --> 22:24.420
It was all right though? Yeah?

22:25.420 --> 22:26.900
Sure.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.259
What's this?

22:37.260 --> 22:39.339
You're a nice kid. Take it.

22:39.340 --> 22:41.139
I'm not a fucking rent boy.

22:41.140 --> 22:45.540
And even if I was, 20 quid?!
Seriously?

22:46.780 --> 22:49.299
You're missing the point, mate.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.940
Just for a moment,
everything was meaningless.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.740
Well.

23:03.220 --> 23:05.739
Cheers.

23:05.740 --> 23:10.539
And erm... you need to see someone
about your dental hygiene problem.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.939
I'm not telling you that
to be cruel,

23:12.940 --> 23:15.420
I'm telling you because it's true.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.658
Alex, I need you to call me back.

23:39.901 --> 23:45.099
Alex, why
aren't you answering your phone?

23:45.100 --> 23:48.139
Alex, your behaviour
is concerning me.

23:48.140 --> 23:50.780
'I'm waiting to hear from you.
OK? Call me.'

23:56.100 --> 23:57.980
What's your stupid card
say today then?

24:14.860 --> 24:16.619
One.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.579
Break and enter a stranger's house.

24:19.580 --> 24:21.979
Liv. Liv, is anyone in?

24:21.980 --> 24:22.940
No.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.299
Definitely a serial killer.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.099
Fucking 'ell! This place stinks!

24:33.100 --> 24:35.860
Yeah. What a dirty bastard.

24:38.020 --> 24:40.059
Exotic porno collection.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.420
Whoah!

24:50.660 --> 24:53.099
Let's fuck with this guy's head.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.139
You're not going to take
a dump on the bed or something?

24:56.140 --> 24:57.660
Exact opposite.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.180
Liv, I'm...

25:23.181 --> 25:24.579
DOOR OPENS

25:24.580 --> 25:25.860

Whoo-hoo!

25:37.580 --> 25:38.860
LAUGHTER

25:41.860 --> 25:42.980
My dad's here.

25:55.820 --> 25:56.780
Hi, Dad.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.260
Hello, Alex.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.780
What are you doing?

26:03.781 --> 26:07.940
I'm doing what you were incapable
of doing. Sorting things out.

26:10.180 --> 26:14.259
Look, we don't need to do this.
She doesn't have to go into a home.

26:14.260 --> 26:18.459
I'll quit college and I'll get
a job. I'll... I'll look after her.

26:18.460 --> 26:18.978
No.

26:18.979 --> 26:20.180
Why not?

26:20.181 --> 26:22.459
Because that's my decision.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.740
No, that's not an answer!

26:23.741 --> 26:27.139
If you're going to get emotional,
I won't discuss it with you.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.099
You're not discussing it
with me anyway!

26:30.100 --> 26:31.620
We all need to take a break!

26:35.140 --> 26:36.700
Calm down.

26:40.260 --> 26:44.099
Meet me tonight for dinner, OK,
and pack this stuff away.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.659
Or I will.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.619
Mum? I'll come back later.

26:47.620 --> 26:51.499
We don't need you.
William's looking after me.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.420
No, Mum.
Dad died a very long time ago.

26:57.940 --> 26:59.900
Here.

27:03.340 --> 27:06.180
I'll call you later -
and pick up this time!

27:09.140 --> 27:10.500
Alex, let's dance.

27:13.020 --> 27:14.059
Come on.

27:14.060 --> 27:16.579
No, not now. Not now, really.

27:16.580 --> 27:21.099
One last dance for old time's sake.
It's no fun dancing on your own.

27:47.740 --> 27:49.379
So I've got the rules right?

27:49.380 --> 27:54.499
Number six is always "run away".
Number one. Hang myself, right.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.019
Number two.

27:56.020 --> 27:57.700
Not sure the dice is for everyone.

27:57.701 --> 27:59.699
Two. Get into heroin.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.180
Case in point.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.380
Let's start smaller, eh?

28:06.740 --> 28:08.939
Wank myself stupid?

28:08.940 --> 28:11.019
Now you've got it.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.099
Can I have your attention, please?

28:13.100 --> 28:16.259
Everyone? Everyone, yeah?

28:16.260 --> 28:22.779
Just to let you know, this afternoon
there'll be a memorial service

28:22.780 --> 28:27.539
for Grace Blood, who tragically died
as the result of a tragic accident.

28:27.540 --> 28:32.619
I'm sure it would mean
a lot to her if you could attend.

28:32.620 --> 28:35.699
These are... bloody difficult times,
yeah?

28:35.700 --> 28:39.660
But if we talk about it,
we'll get through this.

28:40.940 --> 28:43.140
As a community. Together.

28:44.340 --> 28:46.019
Yeah?

28:46.020 --> 28:47.939
And there's one more thing.

28:47.940 --> 28:50.260
Refurbishment's finished
on the squash courts.

28:50.261 --> 28:54.220
They'll be open again from
tomorrow. Thank you.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.619
So?

29:06.620 --> 29:09.099
We're not fucking going,
that's for sure.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.859
So you decide for all of us. Thanks.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.700
I don't think she meant it
that way...

29:13.701 --> 29:15.779
Did he even know her?

29:15.780 --> 29:17.060
We're not going.

29:18.460 --> 29:21.619
Maybe we should, you know,
show face or something.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.259
Better ask her permission.

29:23.260 --> 29:24.739
What's your problem?!

29:24.740 --> 29:27.579
Who's got a problem? Not you.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.898
You're out every night with
Mr Headfuck here.

29:29.899 --> 29:31.100
Don't say that.

29:31.101 --> 29:33.739
Tomorrow will probably mess
with your busy schedule.

29:33.740 --> 29:35.140
Fuck you!

29:59.020 --> 30:02.779
Why did she..?
Why did she have to fucking...?

30:02.780 --> 30:03.580
She just wants attention.

30:03.581 --> 30:04.899
No, Grace!

30:04.900 --> 30:06.499
Why did she...?

30:06.500 --> 30:09.580
Why did she have to fucking...?

30:16.300 --> 30:17.620
Liv.

30:19.620 --> 30:22.459
I didn't get around
to telling you about me.

30:22.460 --> 30:23.860
I'm gay.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.739
Stop it. Stop fucking with my head!

30:28.740 --> 30:30.058
I thought maybe you knew.

30:30.059 --> 30:31.458
No, you didn't think that!

30:31.459 --> 30:32.778
I was going to tell you.

30:32.779 --> 30:34.260
You spineless little shit.

30:34.261 --> 30:37.139
You can't stand up to your dad.
Can't deal with your own life.

30:37.140 --> 30:38.259
You used me!

30:38.260 --> 30:40.180
I've just never had
a proper mate before.

30:40.181 --> 30:41.579
What? What!?

30:41.580 --> 30:43.739
Who said I was your mate, you twat!

30:43.740 --> 30:47.899
Who the fuck are you anyway?
We don't know you.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.500
We don't need you.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.020
Bit stupid.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.580
Leave me alone!

31:34.260 --> 31:35.700
C'mon, Gran.

31:35.701 --> 31:38.540
I don't wanna play
hide and seek today.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.699

All right, yeah.
That's a bloody lie!

34:43.659 --> 34:46.739
I never... It was an accident.
She saw it, accidentally!

34:46.739 --> 34:48.300
I'll take that.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.739
What the fuck is wrong
with all of you?! What the fuck!

34:55.739 --> 34:56.139
Liv!

34:56.141 --> 34:59.979
You wanna remember something? You
want some fond memories to wank over?

Well, remember this.

I know. I really am. I just
get in over my head sometimes.

35:37.420 --> 35:40.499
Really? I practically
had my tongue down your throat!

35:59.220 --> 36:00.779
With everything.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.059
So what are we here for?

36:30.060 --> 36:32.860
This had better be a pretty fucking
decent party.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.220
Looking good so far.

Woo-hoo! Woo!

Fucking hell.

Alo!

37:09.620 --> 37:11.460
Woo-hoo!

Woo!

Alo, I thought you were the DJ.

37:20.141 --> 37:23.059
The high seas!

37:23.060 --> 37:25.580
We should go on boats more often.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.339
Sweet boat. Shit weather.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.899
Yeah.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.219
It was a tough choice between taking
out the boat or the 'copter.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.259
You know how it is.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.620
Nice one.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.140
Alo, Alo!

37:47.860 --> 37:51.139
You should be a captain, Alo.
You should have your own boat.

37:51.140 --> 37:51.980
Did you steal it?

37:51.981 --> 37:53.619
Isn't hard to rent a boat.

37:53.620 --> 37:55.460
You just need a false ID
and a stack-load of cash.

37:55.461 --> 37:57.420
Why?

37:59.940 --> 38:01.739
I think you all need it.

38:01.740 --> 38:04.419
Why do you care?
You didn't even know her...

38:04.420 --> 38:06.459
I know you.

38:06.460 --> 38:09.700
And... I need a friend right now.

38:14.540 --> 38:15.580
So does she.

38:23.940 --> 38:27.300
Being angry with me isn't...
it isn't going to change anything.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.180
So?

38:37.300 --> 38:39.220
So talk to me.

38:40.940 --> 38:44.139
I don't want to.

38:44.140 --> 38:47.260
Or even if I did, I... I can't.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.340
Not without her here.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.420
I need a light...

39:08.300 --> 39:09.580
I haven't got one...

39:20.820 --> 39:24.019
It's funny,
that looks like the one in...

39:26.020 --> 39:29.219
What?

39:29.220 --> 39:31.699
Fuck!

39:31.700 --> 39:33.460
There's a dead body.
What the fuck is it doing?

39:33.461 --> 39:35.019
It's a she.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.060
And she's not doing anything.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.939
Alo! Alo!

39:41.940 --> 39:42.940
ALO!

39:46.820 --> 39:49.099
What's going on?

39:49.100 --> 39:51.620
Alex?

39:53.740 --> 39:55.299
What the fuck?

39:55.300 --> 39:57.899
My gran didn't want to go
where she was told...

39:57.900 --> 40:00.259
She wanted to go
somewhere else instead.

40:00.260 --> 40:01.660
That's it.

40:03.300 --> 40:06.139
That's it! What a relief

40:06.140 --> 40:09.819
You said you weren't allowed
to go to Grace's funeral.

40:09.820 --> 40:15.300
You don't get to say her name,
Gay Boy. This isn't her.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.779
Will you help me?

40:19.780 --> 40:21.459
You've gotta be kidding me!

40:21.460 --> 40:25.620
I'm asking. All right?
I'm asking for a bit of help.

40:28.060 --> 40:29.859
Yeah, let's do it.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.259
What?

40:31.260 --> 40:33.780
Just help him, you idiots.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.499
"My dear.

40:46.500 --> 40:50.900
"The weather is turning and
I'm scared for this leaky old tub.

40:53.580 --> 40:56.260
"But I have to take the odds,
whatever they are.

40:58.020 --> 41:01.140
"Life's a gamble, honey chuck,
you win and you lose.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.579
"But I know you'll wait for me...

41:05.580 --> 41:12.259
"until I round Cape Horn and sail
in to the tide to hold you tight.

41:12.260 --> 41:16.020
"Always yours, William."

41:31.260 --> 41:33.540
If you see our friend...

41:35.540 --> 41:36.860
tell her we miss her.

41:56.580 --> 41:59.579
Is it supposed
to float like that?

41:59.580 --> 42:01.140
I dunno...

42:06.700 --> 42:12.340
Three... two... one... Pow!

42:25.420 --> 42:28.020
'This is Matty. I'm not around
but leave a message.'

42:29.820 --> 42:31.260
It's me.

42:34.620 --> 42:37.380
Don't ever come back.

42:53.220 --> 42:56.420
What are you going to tell your dad?

42:57.860 --> 43:00.299
In the grand scheme of things...

43:00.300 --> 43:01.940
that really doesn't matter now.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.459
I needed that.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.539
No problem.

43:21.540 --> 43:23.619
You do get what "gay" means, right?

43:23.620 --> 43:26.180
That you put it
where the sun don't shine!

43:30.060 --> 43:31.899
Friends?

43:31.900 --> 43:34.380
Friends. Whatever.

43:50.100 --> 43:52.220
Always run away.

43:58.820 --> 44:01.780
Bet you don't dare. Bet you.

44:16.940 --> 44:18.299
Fuck!

44:18.300 --> 44:20.940
We didn't really think about that.

44:22.420 --> 44:23.900
You got that dice?

44:33.580 --> 44:35.819
How do we know what it said?

44:35.820 --> 44:38.660
It said swim, sucker.

44:41.380 --> 44:44.220
Bye, Gran. Be happy.

46:24.900 --> 46:28.140
