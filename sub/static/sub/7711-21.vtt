WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.073
Hey.

00:06.414 --> 00:08.485
Oh, what's this?

00:08.518 --> 00:10.054
That is a demerit.

00:10.089 --> 00:12.426
"Jim Halpert, tardiness."

00:12.458 --> 00:14.129
Ugh.

00:14.162 --> 00:16.166
I love it already.
You've gotta learn, Jim.

00:16.201 --> 00:17.035
You are second in command,

00:17.069 --> 00:18.638
but that does not put you
above the law.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.109
Oh, I understand.

00:20.142 --> 00:22.178
And I also have
lots of questions, like,

00:22.213 --> 00:23.781
what does a demerit mean?

00:23.814 --> 00:25.419
[scoffs]
Let's put it this way.

00:25.451 --> 00:27.556
You do not want to receive
three of those.

00:27.589 --> 00:28.725
Lay it on me.

00:28.757 --> 00:30.461
Three demerits
and you'll receive a citation.

00:30.494 --> 00:32.166
Now that sounds serious.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.235
Oh, it is serious.

00:33.268 --> 00:34.570
Five citations

00:34.603 --> 00:35.772
and you're looking
at a violation.

00:35.804 --> 00:37.143
Four of those

00:37.176 --> 00:38.678
and you'll receive
a verbal warning.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.782
Keep it up, and you're looking
at a written warning.

00:40.814 --> 00:42.485
Two of those,

00:42.518 --> 00:44.357
that'll land you
in a world of hurt...

00:44.389 --> 00:46.661
in the form
of a disciplinary review

00:46.694 --> 00:47.729
written up by me

00:47.763 --> 00:50.169
and placed on the desk
of my immediate superior.

00:50.202 --> 00:51.470
Which would be me.

00:51.503 --> 00:53.540
That is correct.

00:53.574 --> 00:55.578
Okay, I want a copy
on my desk

00:55.612 --> 00:58.185
by the end of the day
or you will receive

00:58.218 --> 00:59.486
a full disadulation.

00:59.519 --> 01:01.557
What's a dis...

01:01.591 --> 01:02.658
what's that?

01:04.630 --> 01:06.267
Oh, you don't want to know.

01:10.408 --> 01:13.381
[cheerful music]

01:13.414 --> 01:21.764
*

01:42.538 --> 01:43.841
[door opens]

01:48.048 --> 01:48.985
Hey, Phyllis.

01:49.017 --> 01:50.389
You all right?

01:50.422 --> 01:53.627
I think I just got flashed.

01:53.660 --> 01:54.997
(Pam)
What?

01:55.029 --> 01:56.334
Really?

01:56.367 --> 01:58.338
In the parking lot.

01:58.371 --> 02:00.241
(Pam)
Oh, my God.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.912
Move!

02:02.946 --> 02:04.583
Okay, I'll call
the real police.

02:04.617 --> 02:05.718
What happened?

02:05.752 --> 02:07.255
What can I do
to help?

02:09.692 --> 02:11.997
I'll check the web.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.835
(Jim)
Thank you.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.038
The police are on it.

02:16.072 --> 02:18.311
They say they've already had
three calls.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.351
Can you tell us
what happened?

02:21.384 --> 02:22.886
Um...

02:22.918 --> 02:24.422
I was walking
to the building

02:24.457 --> 02:26.726
and this man
asked me for directions.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.566
And he was holding a map.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.871
And when I walked over,

02:31.904 --> 02:34.877
he had it out...

02:34.910 --> 02:36.713
on the map.

02:36.746 --> 02:39.018
Phyllis.
You're a married woman.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.020
(Creed)
The guy was just

02:40.052 --> 02:41.424
hanging brain.

02:41.457 --> 02:42.859
I mean,
what's all the fuss?

02:42.893 --> 02:46.131
If that's flashing,
then lock me up.

02:46.164 --> 02:47.702
[whispering]
It's just, like,
so creepy.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.639
[Pam and Ryan whispering]

02:49.672 --> 02:50.708
What's happening?

02:50.741 --> 02:52.778
Oh, some guy
exposed himself

02:52.812 --> 02:54.080
to Phyllis
in the parking lot.

02:54.115 --> 02:56.019
Really?

02:56.052 --> 02:57.121
Is she okay?

02:57.153 --> 02:58.657
Yeah, Bob Vance
took her for a walk

02:58.690 --> 02:59.860
to calm down.

02:59.893 --> 03:01.831
Okay.

03:01.864 --> 03:04.068
[deep breath]

03:04.101 --> 03:05.169
Phyllis, you say?

03:05.204 --> 03:07.443
[Michael snorts]

03:07.475 --> 03:08.445
Hmm.

03:08.477 --> 03:09.947
[suppressed laughter]

03:09.979 --> 03:11.148
What is so funny?

03:11.182 --> 03:14.154
Um...I mean,
did he even see Pam?

03:14.188 --> 03:15.759
Or, uh...

03:15.792 --> 03:17.127
Karen from behind?

03:17.160 --> 03:19.433
I'm guessing not.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.006
[laughing softly]

03:23.038 --> 03:24.577
I'm sorry.

03:24.609 --> 03:28.518
[laughing]

03:28.550 --> 03:30.489
It's pretty funny
when you think about it.

03:30.522 --> 03:32.056
Mm...not really, no.

03:32.091 --> 03:33.695
It's disgusting
and demeaning.

03:33.727 --> 03:35.030
Oh, okay.

03:35.063 --> 03:37.802
Masters of comedy.
A guy dropped his pants.

03:37.835 --> 03:39.607
Have you ever been
to the circus?

03:40.874 --> 03:42.211
Okay.

03:47.154 --> 03:49.190
He's back!

03:49.225 --> 03:51.896
[Michael laughs]

03:51.930 --> 03:53.166
Okay. Hmm.

03:53.198 --> 03:55.103
[babbling]

03:55.137 --> 03:56.240
Waagh!

03:56.272 --> 03:57.808
(Toby)
Hey, what's going on?

03:57.842 --> 03:59.111
There's a police car
in the...

03:59.145 --> 04:00.180
What? Oh.

04:00.212 --> 04:02.217
[makes descending scale]

04:02.251 --> 04:04.154
What's going on?

04:04.188 --> 04:05.924
Oh, Phyllis got flashed.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.194
It's, uh...

04:07.226 --> 04:08.264
[laughter]

04:08.296 --> 04:10.735
I don't think
laughing about it's

04:10.768 --> 04:12.136
appropriate response.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.774
Oh, come on--
we are laughing at Phyllis,

04:13.808 --> 04:15.979
but she's not even here,
so no harm, no foul.

04:16.012 --> 04:17.583
I don't think the women
in this office--

04:17.616 --> 04:19.217
Incidentally, where were you
during all of this?

04:19.251 --> 04:20.555
Maybe you're the flasher.

04:20.589 --> 04:22.223
I was at
a parent-teacher conference.

04:22.257 --> 04:23.695
Uh-huh.

04:23.727 --> 04:25.197
Prove it.
Let's see your penis.

04:28.303 --> 04:29.607
[exhales]

04:29.640 --> 04:31.174
I...

04:31.209 --> 04:32.345
you know,

04:32.377 --> 04:35.183
as that was coming
out of my mouth,

04:35.217 --> 04:37.922
I knew that it was wrong.

04:40.662 --> 04:42.965
In all the excitement,

04:42.998 --> 04:46.340
I forgot
that my primary goal

04:46.372 --> 04:49.747
is to keep people safe.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.686
Women can't have fun

04:52.719 --> 04:54.356
if they don't feel safe.

04:54.388 --> 04:57.796
For example,
Jan and I have a safe word

04:57.828 --> 05:00.167
in case things go too far.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.771
Foliage.

05:01.803 --> 05:04.743
And if one of us
says that word,

05:04.776 --> 05:06.713
the other one has to stop.

05:09.853 --> 05:12.725
Although last time...

05:12.758 --> 05:15.364
she pretended
she didn't hear me.

05:15.397 --> 05:17.968
[Jan on speakerphone]
Michael, come over
after work tonight, okay?

05:18.003 --> 05:19.270
I miss your body.

05:19.305 --> 05:21.309
I don't know.

05:21.342 --> 05:22.713
I feel...

05:22.746 --> 05:24.280
I drive a lot.

05:24.315 --> 05:26.453
I'm spending a fortune
on gas and tolls--

05:26.485 --> 05:27.455
I'll give you $200.

05:27.487 --> 05:28.990
And if I get up before you,

05:29.025 --> 05:30.292
I'll leave it on the dresser.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.398
Um, that...
I don't know.

05:32.431 --> 05:33.835
That makes me
kind of uncomfortable.

05:33.868 --> 05:35.203
$300?

05:35.237 --> 05:37.307
I...uh, well,
I don't know.

05:37.342 --> 05:38.977
Whatever.

05:39.010 --> 05:40.280
Just let my assistant know
if you're coming over

05:40.313 --> 05:41.784
so he can get more vodka,
okay?

05:41.817 --> 05:43.052
Hunter, are you on?

05:43.085 --> 05:44.790
[Hunter on speakerphone]
You got it, Jan.

05:47.462 --> 05:50.132
(Dwight)
Employees of this office
are very small and delicate.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.138
Deserve protection
from local pervs.

05:53.172 --> 05:55.210
Better 1,000 innocent men
are locked up

05:55.243 --> 05:57.415
than one guilty man
roam free.

05:57.447 --> 05:58.384
[exhales]

05:58.417 --> 06:00.119
I am sick over this thing.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.256
Those people out there
are clearly afraid.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.795
And that can't happen.

06:03.828 --> 06:05.397
Not in my house.
Agreed.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.234
Let me show you
what I've been working on.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.269
Okay.

06:08.303 --> 06:10.407
There are
several penises there

06:10.440 --> 06:11.543
I'd love Phyllis
to run her eyes over.

06:11.576 --> 06:13.379
See if we can catch
this pervert.

06:13.413 --> 06:15.250
This is the last thing

06:15.282 --> 06:17.254
that Phyllis needs
to see right now, Dwight.

06:17.287 --> 06:18.289
Look at that one.

06:20.829 --> 06:22.331
Dwight, are those
your pants?

06:22.364 --> 06:24.301
That's a Polaroid.

06:26.372 --> 06:28.175
Attention, everybody.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.847
Dwight has something
he would like to say.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.853
Due to a recent incident
involving Phyllis,

06:32.886 --> 06:34.288
a man,

06:34.321 --> 06:36.158
a map,
and his penis--

06:36.191 --> 06:37.361
I think you know
what I'm referring to--

06:37.394 --> 06:41.302
Michael has authorized me
to form

06:41.335 --> 06:43.440
an emergency
anti-flashing task force.

06:43.474 --> 06:45.010
Question.

06:45.042 --> 06:47.614
Won't that interfere
with your other task forces?

06:47.647 --> 06:50.454
Answer: no, because this
is being given priority one.

06:50.488 --> 06:52.324
This is a petition

06:52.357 --> 06:54.863
for the business park to upgrade
their security cameras

06:54.897 --> 06:57.200
as well as install
two floodlights

06:57.233 --> 06:58.202
in the parking lot.

06:58.235 --> 07:00.441
And I know--
I know what you're thinking.

07:00.474 --> 07:02.545
Won't that just
shed more light

07:02.578 --> 07:03.948
on the penises?

07:03.981 --> 07:06.352
But that is a risk
we have to take.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.155
Pam.
You can draw, kind of.

07:08.189 --> 07:09.525
Why don't you work
with Phallus

07:09.558 --> 07:10.360
on drawing a picture

07:10.392 --> 07:11.462
of the exposer

07:11.495 --> 07:12.665
that I can post
around the community?

07:12.698 --> 07:14.034
Phallus?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.170
Phyllis, sorry.

07:15.203 --> 07:16.639
I've got penises
on the brain.

07:16.673 --> 07:18.376
Back to work, everybody.

07:25.959 --> 07:27.427
I don't often miss Roy.

07:27.462 --> 07:29.431
But I can tell you one thing.

07:29.466 --> 07:32.370
I wish someone had flashed me
when I was with Roy.

07:32.404 --> 07:34.676
Because that would have been
the ass-kicking of the year.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.144
[small laugh]

07:36.179 --> 07:39.486
Especially
if it had been Jim.

07:39.519 --> 07:42.057
He would not have wanted me
to have seen Jim's...

07:44.061 --> 07:45.197
Whoo, I am...

07:45.229 --> 07:47.233
I am saying a lot of things.

07:50.172 --> 07:51.710
I didn't really get
a good look.

07:51.742 --> 07:53.345
That's okay.

07:53.378 --> 07:54.748
I don't feel
like answering phones.

07:54.781 --> 07:57.286
Hey, did you guys see this memo
that Dwight sent out?

07:57.320 --> 08:00.127
"Women will be sent home

08:00.160 --> 08:02.665
"if they wear makeup or heels
exceeding 1/4 inch.

08:02.698 --> 08:05.202
"Females are not allowed
to speak to strangers

08:05.237 --> 08:07.140
"unless given written
authorization

08:07.174 --> 08:08.376
by Dwight Schrute."

08:08.408 --> 08:09.779
This is ridiculous.
Attention.

08:09.812 --> 08:12.517
I am removing all bananas
from the kitchen.

08:13.787 --> 08:16.359
Dwight, this memo
that you distributed

08:16.392 --> 08:18.496
is insulting.

08:18.530 --> 08:20.167
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.468
(Pam)
"Sleeves down to the wrists,

08:21.503 --> 08:23.773
buttoned-up collars,
and muted colors."

08:23.807 --> 08:25.442
Nobody dresses like that.

08:25.476 --> 08:27.446
(Michael)
Okay, you know something,
Dwight?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.051
We are not the terrorists.

08:29.085 --> 08:30.754
Why don't you just
take these women,

08:30.787 --> 08:33.392
put 'em in a burlap sack,
and hit 'em with a stick?

08:33.425 --> 08:34.796
Because that's
what you're doing.

08:34.828 --> 08:36.533
I celebrate these women.

08:36.566 --> 08:40.307
They deserve the right
to dress as they please.

08:40.339 --> 08:41.610
If Pam wants
to show more cleavage,

08:41.643 --> 08:42.844
she should be able to.

08:42.877 --> 08:44.582
I encourage that.

08:44.616 --> 08:45.651
(Karen)
Look, it's really simple.

08:45.684 --> 08:48.590
We just want you guys
to treat us with respect.

08:48.624 --> 08:50.327
See? That's what
we're talking about.

08:50.359 --> 08:51.563
Did you hear that, Dwight?

08:51.596 --> 08:52.632
Yes.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.300
Did you hear that, Michael?

08:54.335 --> 08:57.575
No, Dwight. Respect.
R-E-S-P--svee--T.

08:57.608 --> 09:00.213
Find out what it means
to me.

09:00.247 --> 09:03.252
All right, you know what?
That's it.

09:03.286 --> 09:04.520
Conference room,
five minutes.

09:04.556 --> 09:05.791
Women's appreciation.

09:05.823 --> 09:07.795
Wait a second, how are you
qualified for that?

09:07.827 --> 09:09.832
Oh, I don't know, James.

09:09.865 --> 09:11.570
Did I come from a woman?

09:11.603 --> 09:13.238
Have I slept
with a woman?

09:13.272 --> 09:15.276
More than one?
Mm, less than three.

09:15.309 --> 09:17.414
That is not current.
You know what?

09:17.446 --> 09:19.151
Why doesn't Oscar
run the meeting?

09:19.185 --> 09:20.452
He's a homosexual.

09:20.487 --> 09:22.456
Why don't you run the meeting?
You play with dolls.

09:22.491 --> 09:23.258
Those are collectable
action figures

09:23.293 --> 09:25.430
and they're worth more
than your car.

09:25.462 --> 09:26.899
You know what?
I am the expert.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.535
I will conduct it.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.905
I know the crap out of women.

09:29.939 --> 09:31.643
I, um...

09:31.676 --> 09:34.547
would like to apologize
for all of the men

09:34.581 --> 09:37.287
who thought this
was a laughing matter.

09:37.321 --> 09:38.555
Are we still
discussing this?

09:38.589 --> 09:40.861
I say again,
what is the big deal?

09:40.893 --> 09:42.932
Nobody likes to be flashed.

09:42.964 --> 09:45.771
When Meredith flashed me
at that Christmas party,

09:45.804 --> 09:46.905
I nearly vomited.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.643
I don't remember doing that.

09:48.677 --> 09:49.779
What a surprise.

09:49.812 --> 09:51.514
(Michael)
Okay, no catfights.
Please. Let's--

09:51.548 --> 09:53.552
my point is...

09:53.585 --> 09:56.960
my point is...

09:56.992 --> 09:58.528
a penis,

09:58.562 --> 10:00.367
when seen

10:00.400 --> 10:01.201
in the right context,

10:01.201 --> 10:05.376
is the most wonderful sight
for a woman.

10:05.410 --> 10:06.444
But in the wrong context,

10:06.479 --> 10:07.647
it is like a monster movie.

10:07.681 --> 10:09.619
Alien.
Blagh!

10:09.651 --> 10:10.987
Whether--shut it.
Shut. Up.

10:11.021 --> 10:12.692
Okay, so what I want

10:12.725 --> 10:16.498
to engage us in today
is a hardcore discussion

10:16.532 --> 10:20.273
about women's problems
and issues

10:20.307 --> 10:21.675
and situations.

10:21.709 --> 10:23.679
Magazines and TV shows

10:23.713 --> 10:26.451
and movies portray women

10:26.485 --> 10:29.658
as skinny, tall goddesses.

10:29.691 --> 10:31.796
Well, look around.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.666
Are women like that?

10:33.699 --> 10:35.602
No.

10:35.637 --> 10:38.643
No, they are not.

10:38.676 --> 10:39.846
Even the hot ones

10:39.879 --> 10:42.852
aren't really
that skinny.

10:42.885 --> 10:44.587
So what does that say?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.759
That says that you women

10:46.793 --> 10:48.763
are up against it.

10:48.797 --> 10:49.899
And it is criminal.

10:49.932 --> 10:51.634
Society doesn't care.

10:51.669 --> 10:53.439
Society sucks.

10:53.473 --> 10:55.978
I don't even consider myself
a part of society.

10:56.011 --> 10:57.514
FYI.

10:57.546 --> 11:00.720
Because I am so angry
over all of this.

11:00.753 --> 11:02.590
If it were up to me,

11:02.624 --> 11:05.898
you ladies
would be the fashion models.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.467
Yes, Andy.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.437
Then the fashion models
could come here

11:09.470 --> 11:10.539
and work with me.

11:10.573 --> 11:11.642
What you're saying

11:11.676 --> 11:12.812
is extremely misogynistic.

11:12.845 --> 11:15.718
Yes.
Thank you.

11:15.751 --> 11:17.553
That was not necessary,

11:17.587 --> 11:18.924
but I appreciated it.

11:18.957 --> 11:20.092
And it proves my point.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.762
Women can do anything.

11:21.795 --> 11:24.066
I'm saying
that you're being sexist.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.740
No, I'm being misogynistic.

11:26.772 --> 11:29.110
That is insane.
I am not being sexist.

11:29.143 --> 11:30.646
That--
it's the same thing.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.615
Michael.
Yes.

11:31.648 --> 11:32.851
When I got my hair
cut short,

11:32.885 --> 11:34.788
you asked me
if I was a lesbian.

11:34.821 --> 11:36.559
Because wha...

11:36.592 --> 11:38.062
that was one
possible explanation

11:38.095 --> 11:40.632
as to why
you got that haircut.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.636
And when we get mad,
you always ask us

11:42.671 --> 11:44.174
if we're on our periods.

11:44.206 --> 11:46.210
I have to know
whether you're serious or not.

11:46.243 --> 11:48.849
I wish I could menstruate.

11:48.883 --> 11:50.652
If I could menstruate,
I wouldn't have to deal

11:50.687 --> 11:52.457
with idiotic calendars
anymore.

11:52.491 --> 11:55.497
I'd just be able to count down
from my previous cycle.

11:55.530 --> 11:58.167
Plus, I'd be more in tune
with the moon and the tides.

11:58.202 --> 11:59.805
Can we just get back
to work?

11:59.838 --> 12:01.041
Ye--okay, yes.

12:01.074 --> 12:02.677
This is not work talk.
You're right.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.515
You're right, you're right.
And you know why?

12:04.548 --> 12:05.784
It's because

12:05.818 --> 12:06.551
of where we are.

12:06.585 --> 12:08.889
This is
a masculine environment.

12:08.923 --> 12:12.162
We need to find a place
where you feel comfortable.

12:12.196 --> 12:15.168
You know
where we're gonna go?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.571
The Steamtown Mall.

12:16.604 --> 12:18.174
[Kelly gasps]

12:18.208 --> 12:19.811
Frankly,
it's kind of insulting.

12:19.846 --> 12:22.817
But I have a bunch of stuff
I need to return in my car.

12:22.852 --> 12:25.791
So...I could do that.

12:25.823 --> 12:28.228
Malls are just awful
and humiliating.

12:28.261 --> 12:30.198
They're just store
after store

12:30.232 --> 12:32.571
of these horrible salespeople
making a big fuss

12:32.604 --> 12:34.776
out of an adult shopping
in a junior's section.

12:34.808 --> 12:39.718
There are petite adults
who are sort of...smaller

12:39.750 --> 12:41.288
who need to wear...

12:41.320 --> 12:43.758
maybe a kids' size 10.

12:43.794 --> 12:45.897
Okay, let's go,

12:45.930 --> 12:47.634
ladies of Dunder-Mifflin.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.005
Hey, we should have
a calendar printed up.

12:50.039 --> 12:52.310
Pam, put that
in my good idea folder.

12:52.342 --> 12:54.047
Let's go!

12:54.080 --> 12:55.818
(Dwight)
Have you finished
with the sketch?

12:55.850 --> 12:57.787
Yeah.

12:57.822 --> 12:59.625
Hmm, doesn't seem
like the type.

12:59.658 --> 13:01.061
Uh, Phyllis got
a good look.

13:01.094 --> 13:02.697
Hmm.

13:06.037 --> 13:09.277
I plan on plastering
this pervert's face everywhere.

13:09.309 --> 13:12.918
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

13:15.121 --> 13:16.123
[tires screeching]
Oh.

13:16.158 --> 13:17.192
(Angela)
Meredith, slow down!

13:17.225 --> 13:19.730
We're not gonna get there
any faster if we're dead.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.635
Thanks.
I know how to drive.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.182
(Pam)
Oh, yeah.

13:28.215 --> 13:29.750
You really shouldn't litter.

13:29.785 --> 13:32.824
My car, my rules.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.170
Hey, Jim.

13:39.204 --> 13:41.274
You wanna go
in the women's bathroom?

13:41.308 --> 13:42.711
No.

13:42.744 --> 13:43.679
Thank you, though.

13:43.713 --> 13:45.316
You aren't curious?

13:45.349 --> 13:46.450
Not really.

13:46.483 --> 13:47.821
I've seen a bathroom before.

13:47.855 --> 13:49.224
Yeah, but...

13:49.257 --> 13:51.795
it's every guy's fantasy.

13:51.829 --> 13:54.200
I think you mean
a girl's locker room.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.438
And in the fantasy,
there's usually girls in it.

13:56.470 --> 13:58.809
[quietly]
Yeah.

13:58.844 --> 14:00.747
I'm going in.

14:00.780 --> 14:01.681
Go crazy.

14:06.759 --> 14:09.830
Oh...my...God.

14:09.865 --> 14:11.902
(Andy)
I really appreciate
your letting me work

14:11.936 --> 14:13.005
alongside you
so closely today.

14:13.038 --> 14:14.507
Of course you do,
moon face.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.944
That's because
you're a preppy freak,

14:15.977 --> 14:17.846
you're the office pariah,
and nobody likes you.

14:17.882 --> 14:20.719
So start hanging these
all around the building.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.968
This guy looks like
a real deviant.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.972
No, duh.
That's why we gotta catch him.

14:30.005 --> 14:31.007
Start hanging those.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.410
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

14:32.442 --> 14:34.479
More like,
"Aye, aye, General."

14:34.514 --> 14:37.888
(Michael)
I don't think
she's gonna make it.

14:37.922 --> 14:39.524
Don't think
she's gonna make it--

14:39.556 --> 14:43.265
[metal scraping]

14:43.298 --> 14:44.467
It's a little too tight.

14:44.499 --> 14:46.570
I'm gonna find another spot.

14:46.603 --> 14:49.277
Many women
are competent drivers.

14:49.310 --> 14:52.316
[scraping]

14:59.898 --> 15:00.867
[exhales]

15:00.900 --> 15:03.071
This is what we know.

15:06.511 --> 15:08.114
(Jim)
Well, I stand corrected.

15:08.148 --> 15:09.283
This is pretty cool.

15:09.317 --> 15:10.585
Yes.

15:10.619 --> 15:11.453
Hey, uh...

15:11.487 --> 15:13.993
where'd you decide
to take Karen tonight?

15:14.026 --> 15:15.261
Anna Maria's.

15:15.296 --> 15:16.363
(Ryan)
What's the occasion?

15:16.398 --> 15:17.432
Six-month anniversary.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.574
What?

15:21.607 --> 15:23.611
Nothing--I think, uh,
we all kinda thought

15:23.645 --> 15:25.048
you guys were just,
like, hooking up.

15:25.082 --> 15:28.554
No, we've been dating
for six months.

15:28.588 --> 15:33.398
Uh, she might mention
an email that I wrote

15:33.432 --> 15:34.400
a while back, um--

15:34.434 --> 15:35.301
Oh, right.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.040
I remember that one.
She read it to me.

15:37.073 --> 15:39.010
She said...

15:39.044 --> 15:41.081
she's not really ready
to date somebody in the office,

15:41.113 --> 15:42.917
but she really likes you
as a friend.

15:42.952 --> 15:44.956
I figured.

15:44.989 --> 15:46.123
It's cool.

15:46.158 --> 15:47.292
I don't--
I wouldn't want to be

15:47.325 --> 15:49.097
in an office relationship
anyway.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.371
All right.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.509
Hope nobody's on a diet.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.312
Thanks, Michael.
You're welcome.

15:57.345 --> 15:59.184
You're welcome,
you're welcome.

15:59.216 --> 16:01.921
Okay.

16:01.921 --> 16:03.958
So, let's dish.

16:03.994 --> 16:05.998
What do you want
to dish about?

16:06.030 --> 16:08.335
Anything you guys want.
This is your time.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.190
[Michael exhales]

16:21.793 --> 16:25.002
Mm.
What is a Pap smear?

16:25.036 --> 16:26.538
Or is it "shmear?"

16:26.571 --> 16:27.773
Like the cream cheese.

16:27.805 --> 16:29.676
Okay.
New topic.

16:29.710 --> 16:32.150
Kelly, how are things
with Ryan?

16:32.182 --> 16:33.317
Awesome.

16:33.352 --> 16:35.056
Um, awful, I mean.

16:35.089 --> 16:37.359
But, uh,
sometimes awesome.

16:37.392 --> 16:39.329
(Michael)
What, um...

16:39.363 --> 16:41.101
what do you think
of role-play?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.402
Oh, it can be fun.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.638
Yeah?

16:43.672 --> 16:47.312
Well, Jan has
this schoolgirl fantasy.

16:47.345 --> 16:48.615
It's a pretty common one.

16:48.648 --> 16:49.483
I just...

16:49.517 --> 16:51.820
I feel uncomfortable
wearing the dress.

16:51.853 --> 16:53.125
Okay.

16:53.158 --> 16:55.828
I'm gonna be
at the doll store.

16:55.861 --> 16:58.501
Sometimes, the clothes
at GapKids are just too flashy.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.838
So I'm forced to go
to the American Girl store

17:00.871 --> 17:04.813
and order clothes
for large colonial dolls.

17:04.846 --> 17:06.517
Michael,
you shouldn't do anything

17:06.551 --> 17:07.719
that you're
uncomfortable with.

17:07.753 --> 17:09.824
Jan says anything
that doesn't scare us

17:09.856 --> 17:11.528
is not worth doing.

17:11.561 --> 17:12.762
I don't know.

17:12.796 --> 17:13.831
Maybe we're different people.

17:13.865 --> 17:14.733
I like cuddling

17:14.766 --> 17:16.304
and spooning

17:16.337 --> 17:17.806
and she likes
videotaping us during sex.

17:17.839 --> 17:18.841
Oh, my God.

17:18.875 --> 17:19.776
[Michael groans]

17:19.810 --> 17:21.780
And then watching it back
right afterward

17:21.814 --> 17:23.517
to improve my form.

17:23.551 --> 17:25.156
That is not
healthy behavior.

17:25.189 --> 17:26.357
No, it's not
that bad.

17:26.391 --> 17:29.229
The worst part
is that she shows it

17:29.264 --> 17:31.867
to her therapist
and they discuss it.

17:31.901 --> 17:33.205
Michael, you need
to get out of this.

17:33.237 --> 17:34.774
No, she's...

17:34.807 --> 17:36.311
she's fooling around.

17:36.343 --> 17:38.248
It's a woman thing.

17:38.282 --> 17:40.518
No, normal women
don't do stuff like that.

17:40.551 --> 17:42.823
This is bad.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.542
No...

17:52.575 --> 17:53.745
No, it's all right.
I'm okay.

17:53.778 --> 17:54.814
I'm okay.

17:54.847 --> 17:56.883
[sniffling]

17:56.918 --> 17:59.657
You guys...

17:59.690 --> 18:02.162
what am I gonna do
about Jan?

18:02.162 --> 18:04.667
[Michael sighs]

18:05.568 --> 18:07.772
Done.

18:07.806 --> 18:09.409
Read the pros first.

18:09.444 --> 18:12.215
Okay.
Jan is smart.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.254
Uh, successful.

18:14.286 --> 18:16.457
Good clothes.
Hot.

18:16.491 --> 18:18.627
Perfect skin.

18:18.661 --> 18:19.930
Nice butt.

18:19.963 --> 18:21.501
She does have
very nice clothes.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.005
Okay, okay.
Um, cons.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.509
Cons.

18:25.541 --> 18:27.612
Wears too much makeup.

18:27.645 --> 18:30.351
Breasts: not anything
to write home about.

18:30.386 --> 18:31.888
Insecure about body.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.458
I'm unhappy
when I'm with her.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.526
Flat-chested.

18:34.559 --> 18:35.429
What was the last one?

18:35.461 --> 18:37.733
She's totally flat.
Shrunken chesticles.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.770
No, the one
before that.

18:39.804 --> 18:42.743
I'm unhappy
when I'm with her.

18:42.776 --> 18:44.414
Michael...

18:44.447 --> 18:46.617
you shouldn't be with someone
who doesn't make you happy.

18:46.650 --> 18:47.985
I'm happy sometimes.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.394
Um...

18:51.428 --> 18:52.963
when we scrapbook

18:52.995 --> 18:55.869
or right towards the end
of having sex.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.505
Look, most relationships

18:57.540 --> 18:58.507
have their rough patches.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.912
You just have
to push through it sometimes.

19:00.946 --> 19:02.282
Yeah, that's smart.
Maybe.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.987
But it sounds like you're just
wrong for each other.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.924
That sounds good too.

19:09.062 --> 19:11.500
I don't know who's right.

19:11.534 --> 19:13.069
I just don't--I don't know.
I don't know.

19:13.103 --> 19:14.473
I bet you know.

19:14.506 --> 19:15.508
Don't think,
just answer.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.111
What do you want to do
about Jan?

19:17.144 --> 19:19.617
I wanna break up
with Jan.

19:19.649 --> 19:21.554
Wow.

19:21.587 --> 19:23.558
I wanna break up
with Jan.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.663
My mom taught me that.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.510
Wow, I cannot believe
this yogurt has no calories.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.382
No one said
it has no calories.

19:35.416 --> 19:37.585
Oh, hey, guys.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.723
I want to do something nice
for you,

19:39.756 --> 19:43.030
because you did something
so nice for me earlier.

19:43.063 --> 19:45.402
I want you
to go in there.

19:45.436 --> 19:48.140
I want you to buy one item
on me as a thank-you.

19:48.172 --> 19:50.479
Come on.
Get in here.

19:50.512 --> 19:52.650
Let's face it, most guys
are from the Dark Ages.

19:52.682 --> 19:53.717
They're cavemen.

19:53.751 --> 19:56.891
And they like a woman
to be showing her cleavage

19:56.924 --> 19:59.127
and to be wearing
8-inch heels,

19:59.162 --> 20:04.540
and to be wearing, um,
see-through underpants.

20:04.573 --> 20:06.444
But...

20:06.478 --> 20:09.516
for me,
a woman looks best

20:09.550 --> 20:13.022
when she
is just absolutely naked.

20:17.733 --> 20:20.037
This is so great, huh?

20:22.676 --> 20:24.547
We should do this
much more often.

20:24.579 --> 20:27.217
I-I think we hang out
an appropriate amount of time.

20:30.858 --> 20:32.996
What are you doing in here?
This is the women's room.

20:33.030 --> 20:34.699
You're in here.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.036
I pay for that privilege.

20:42.683 --> 20:43.585
Okay.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.689
[speaking loudly]
I'm a pretty normal guy.

20:45.721 --> 20:46.923
I do one weird thing.

20:46.957 --> 20:48.595
I like to go
in the women's room

20:48.628 --> 20:49.729
for number two.

20:49.764 --> 20:51.668
I've been caught
several times

20:51.701 --> 20:53.705
and I have paid dearly.

20:53.737 --> 20:55.040
[deep breath]

20:55.074 --> 20:56.644
Mm.

20:56.678 --> 20:58.180
You don't want anything?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.883
My treat.

20:59.916 --> 21:02.522
Some panties or...

21:02.522 --> 21:04.559
pick a thong or...

21:04.594 --> 21:06.029
G-string.

21:06.061 --> 21:07.733
T-back.

21:07.765 --> 21:08.902
Get a nice bra.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.705
Padded bra.

21:10.738 --> 21:13.110
See-through,
push-up, lace?

21:13.142 --> 21:14.579
Thigh-high?
Bustier?

21:14.614 --> 21:16.016
Any--it just--

21:16.049 --> 21:18.320
you know what,
I would love to buy you

21:18.354 --> 21:20.057
a fresh set of underwear.

21:20.090 --> 21:23.163
(Karen)
Phyllis.

21:23.195 --> 21:24.634
What do you think?
Too much?

21:24.667 --> 21:26.102
Jim's gonna love it.

21:26.136 --> 21:28.140
[giggles]

21:33.150 --> 21:35.120
I'm kind of in-between
boyfriends right now.

21:35.154 --> 21:37.892
So I don't need
anything sexy.

21:37.925 --> 21:39.864
But I do need
some new hand towels.

21:39.896 --> 21:42.803
I figure
I can cut up this robe.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.939
(Angela)
Slower.

21:44.973 --> 21:46.811
Slower.

21:46.843 --> 21:48.113
Meredith.

21:48.146 --> 21:49.750
[Michael's cell phone
ringing My Humps]

21:49.784 --> 21:51.352
Slow it up.
Oh.

21:51.387 --> 21:53.123
Oh, no.

21:53.156 --> 21:54.959
[inhales sharply]

21:54.993 --> 21:55.995
It's Jan.

21:56.028 --> 21:57.399
What do I do?

21:57.431 --> 21:58.835
Answer it.
Don't answer it.

21:58.867 --> 22:02.642
*

22:02.642 --> 22:04.212
Okay, it stopped.

22:04.245 --> 22:05.447
[bang]

22:05.481 --> 22:06.950
[tires screeching]
Crap.

22:06.984 --> 22:08.319
(Kelly)
Whoa.

22:18.775 --> 22:21.246
[snickers]

22:21.279 --> 22:22.783
That is pretty cool.

22:28.827 --> 22:30.064
(Kelly)
Michael, you know how
to, um--

22:30.096 --> 22:31.900
change a wheel, right?

22:31.934 --> 22:34.037
Uh, yeah.

22:34.072 --> 22:37.311
Yep. Um...

22:37.344 --> 22:39.081
Could somebody
grab me the lever,

22:39.114 --> 22:40.385
and I will...

22:40.418 --> 22:42.288
Here, uh...Meredith?

22:42.321 --> 22:43.892
Why don't you
put your hazards on.

22:43.925 --> 22:46.764
Yeah, get your hazards on
for safety.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.134
Let's see.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.075
There we go!

22:53.109 --> 22:54.880
Good.

22:54.914 --> 22:56.115
Yes, we have the...

22:56.148 --> 22:59.824
all right.

22:59.857 --> 23:01.292
(Pam)
I think I've got it.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.403
Do you have a--
a crescent?

23:06.436 --> 23:07.840
A crescent Allan?

23:07.872 --> 23:10.044
I don't think we really
need that, Michael.

23:10.076 --> 23:11.279
Uh...you know what?

23:11.311 --> 23:13.416
I'm going to...
you take care of that.

23:13.450 --> 23:15.588
I'm gonna do traffic...

23:15.621 --> 23:16.590
detail.

23:16.623 --> 23:20.063
(Pam)
You know, I changed
a tire today.

23:20.097 --> 23:22.133
All by myself.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.972
This bathrobe's already
coming in handy.

23:24.004 --> 23:25.174
[Meredith honking]

23:25.206 --> 23:27.812
Coming!

23:31.186 --> 23:32.489
Think we'll find him?

23:32.521 --> 23:33.590
Yeah, I do.

23:33.624 --> 23:35.461
'Cause justice
never rests.

23:35.495 --> 23:37.364
Halvsies?

23:37.398 --> 23:39.603
No.
Wholesies.

23:41.908 --> 23:43.275
Listen, man,
I really appreciate

23:43.309 --> 23:44.578
you letting me
shadow you today.

23:44.613 --> 23:46.349
I feel like
I learned a lot.
Natch.

23:46.382 --> 23:48.285
Yep.

23:48.319 --> 23:49.957
If you don't mind,

23:49.990 --> 23:51.560
I think I'll hang up
some of these posters

23:51.592 --> 23:52.930
around my neighborhood.

23:52.963 --> 23:55.333
Schools, post office,
et cetera.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.639
You know,

23:57.671 --> 23:59.576
I may have
underestimated you.

23:59.608 --> 24:01.948
You're not a total ass.

24:01.981 --> 24:03.951
[coughs]

24:10.129 --> 24:13.236
Okay, I am
really going to do this.

24:13.270 --> 24:14.605
(Pam)
Good luck, Michael.

24:14.639 --> 24:16.710
You know what?
I need my girls with me.

24:16.743 --> 24:18.280
Pam, Karen,
even Phyllis.

24:18.313 --> 24:19.615
Come on.
Let's do this.

24:19.649 --> 24:21.686
Let's do it.

24:24.025 --> 24:25.326
[sighs]

24:25.359 --> 24:26.696
Okay, remember, be strong.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.936
[dialing phone]

24:33.776 --> 24:35.214
I love you guys.

24:36.449 --> 24:38.252
Now I'm getting
her voicemail.

24:38.285 --> 24:39.421
Don't leave a--

24:39.455 --> 24:40.558
Hey, Jan.
It's me, Michael.

24:40.591 --> 24:42.996
I'm just calling to say

24:43.030 --> 24:45.767
that I think we need
a little break, permanently.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.609
And, uh, I know
everybody says this,

24:49.643 --> 24:52.682
but I-I wanna remain friends.

24:52.714 --> 24:55.688
Or at least
business associates

24:55.720 --> 24:58.527
who get along.

24:58.561 --> 25:00.565
Oh, just so you know,
it's not me, it's you.

25:04.438 --> 25:05.807
Okay, buddy.

25:05.841 --> 25:07.211
Somebody just walked in.

25:07.243 --> 25:08.380
I have to go.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.050
Um, so I'll
talk to you later.

25:10.084 --> 25:12.388
[door closes]

25:12.421 --> 25:14.092
Michael...
[clears throat]

25:14.124 --> 25:16.562
I was, um...

25:16.597 --> 25:18.767
I was really unhappy
with our conversation earlier.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.072
And I...

25:21.106 --> 25:23.743
I just--I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

25:23.777 --> 25:26.282
So I decided that I would
drive down here

25:26.315 --> 25:28.621
and apologize to you
in person.

25:28.654 --> 25:30.523
So...

25:37.204 --> 25:38.841
I'm sorry.

25:38.873 --> 25:42.380
Thank you.

25:42.413 --> 25:44.417
So...

25:44.451 --> 25:46.289
we're good?

25:46.321 --> 25:48.525
Abso-fruit-ly.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.364
[Jan's phone vibrates]
Oh.
Hold on, I'm sorry.

25:50.396 --> 25:51.733
No...no...

25:51.767 --> 25:53.102
One second.

25:55.339 --> 25:57.543
Oh! It's from you.

26:00.718 --> 26:02.254
Uh, you wanna
grab some dinner?

26:02.288 --> 26:04.324
[voice on phone]
It's me, Michael.
Okay.

26:04.358 --> 26:05.660
I'm just calling to say
that I think

26:05.695 --> 26:08.533
we need a little break,
permanently.

26:08.565 --> 26:12.273
And, uh, I know
everybody says this,

26:12.307 --> 26:13.611
but I want...

26:13.644 --> 26:14.745
Maybe some Italian.

26:14.778 --> 26:17.417
Or at least
business associates--

26:17.451 --> 26:19.554
Chinese?

26:19.588 --> 26:21.425
Oh, just so you know,

26:21.459 --> 26:23.831
it's not me, it's you.

26:23.863 --> 26:25.901
Okay, buddy.

26:25.934 --> 26:27.271
Oh.

26:29.843 --> 26:31.780
[door closes]

26:31.812 --> 26:33.883
[Michael sighs]

26:33.917 --> 26:35.920
Any man who says
he totally understands women

26:35.955 --> 26:37.825
is a fool.

26:37.859 --> 26:40.429
Because they are
un-understandable.

26:40.464 --> 26:43.804
There's a wishing fountain
at the mall.

26:43.837 --> 26:47.278
And I threw a coin in
for every woman in the world

26:47.311 --> 26:48.613
and made a wish.

26:48.646 --> 26:51.720
I wished for Jan
to get over me.

26:51.753 --> 26:54.591
I wished for Phyllis,
a plasma TV.

26:54.625 --> 26:58.266
I wished for Pam
to gain courage.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.773
I wished for Angela,
a heart,

27:01.807 --> 27:03.242
and for Kelly, a brain.

27:03.242 --> 27:06.382
"Michael, how can you
appreciate women so much

27:06.415 --> 27:08.821
but also dump one of them?"

27:08.853 --> 27:13.028
You mean, how can I be
so illogical

27:13.062 --> 27:14.965
and flighty
and unpredictable

27:14.999 --> 27:17.370
and emotional?

27:19.708 --> 27:23.450
Well, maybe I learned something
from women after all.

Hey, Dwight.
It's Jim.

27:31.064 --> 27:33.068
Jim, what are you doing?
I'm busy.

27:33.102 --> 27:34.405
No, you're not.

27:34.437 --> 27:35.808
I'm looking right at you.

27:35.841 --> 27:36.943
Ugh. I'm hanging up.

27:36.977 --> 27:38.012
Don't.

27:38.044 --> 27:40.048
[quietly]
I have information

27:40.083 --> 27:40.985
about the sex predator.

27:41.018 --> 27:45.026
You have information
about the sex predator?

27:45.058 --> 27:47.832
I saw him
two minutes ago.

27:47.865 --> 27:49.001
Where?

27:49.034 --> 27:51.739
In the women's bathroom,
above the sink.

27:58.921 --> 28:00.891
Anti-flashing task force!

28:00.925 --> 28:03.094
Above the sink.

28:03.129 --> 28:05.033
Above the sink.

28:05.066 --> 28:06.602
Hmm.
