00:06.215 --> 00:07.796
SNOW WHITE: / was very young,
and your mother...

00:07.884 --> 00:09.420
REGINA: She ripped his heart out.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.375
REGINA: Henry, you’re gonna
go home with David.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.506
I want you to be here
because you want to be here.

00:13.598 --> 00:14.678
Not because of magic.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.882
I want to redeem myself.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.675
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.094
And I won't become like her?

00:21.230 --> 00:24.063
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.

00:24.317 --> 00:26.273
It's not safe here. Cora's still out there.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.605
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.027
Hello, Hook.

00:31.157 --> 00:33.364
AURORA: I don't know if I can
do this. I'm not a very good liar.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.282
SNOW WHITE: It's not
really a lie, Aurora.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.533
Lancelot did die an honorable death
and Cora did escape. A” true.

00:39.624 --> 00:41.831
Just leave the particulars to us.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.408
There's no reason to cause

00:43.502 --> 00:44.958
unnecessary panic
amongst your people.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.161
AURORA: I'm not so sure
it's unnecessary...

MULAN: This can't be.

01:16.869 --> 01:20.327
Our land, we were protected here,
hidden. How did the Ogres find us?

01:22.667 --> 01:24.623
-Ogres didn't do this.
-What?

01:24.710 --> 01:26.371
Cora did.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.328
Their hearts, they were ripped out.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.672
This is her magic, twisted and evil.

01:31.801 --> 01:32.881
We have to stop her.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.127
We're too late.
She killed them. She killed them all.

01:36.222 --> 01:38.008
But we have to stop her
before she hurts anyone else.

01:38.808 --> 01:41.550
Hey. Hey. Look.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.636

He's alive.

I really appreciate it.

All right. See you.

You. We need to talk.

02:18.889 --> 02:19.878
Oh!

02:21.559 --> 02:22.548
What the hell was that for?

02:22.727 --> 02:25.093
Sleeping with my wife.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.685
-Kathryn?
-Snow.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.888
Look, I didn't know, all right?
I was cursed.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.687
Yeah. I got it. What do you want?

02:32.445 --> 02:33.685
(SIGHS)

02:34.405 --> 02:37.897
So...is it true?

02:38.034 --> 02:39.194
People are saying that

02:39.285 --> 02:41.446
you're trying to find a way
to build a portal back to your land

02:41.579 --> 02:43.490
because that's where you think
Emma and Mary Margaret are,

02:43.581 --> 02:44.570
that they're alive.

02:44.707 --> 02:49.246
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.243
That's exactly what I'm doing.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.292
But the land, it's gone.
Destroyed by the curse.

02:54.592 --> 02:55.707
Apparently not.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.174
Well, you having any luck?

02:59.263 --> 03:01.675
Not yet. We're working on it.

03:01.766 --> 03:04.633
Does that mean
that all the lands still exist?

03:07.897 --> 03:08.886
Possibly.

03:08.981 --> 03:13.099
So the Queen lied to us, again.
Are you sure?

03:14.445 --> 03:15.901
Remember who we're talking about.

ARCHIE: Regina.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.699
Are you here to see me?

03:21.786 --> 03:24.243
I've been trying to keep my promise
to Henry, but it's been difficult.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.490
To not use magic.

03:25.623 --> 03:26.658
It's been two days.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.156
That's an excellent start.

03:30.795 --> 03:32.285
Come on in.

03:35.341 --> 03:39.755
It's just that magic is the way
I've always gotten everything.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.803
It sounds like it's also the way
you've lost everything.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.222

03:55.528 --> 03:57.769
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.362
Why don't you check the missing board,
like everyone else?

04:00.449 --> 04:02.531
Your curse only brought the living.

04:03.828 --> 04:06.740
Well, then, I'm sorry for your loss.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.654
But I'm afraid
I can't send anyone anywhere.

04:08.833 --> 04:09.913
Can't or won't?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.127
Dr. Whale, I have to insist, please.

04:13.003 --> 04:13.992
Go.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.511
Sorry.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.311
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?

04:37.069 --> 04:38.104
I'm sorry?

04:38.195 --> 04:42.484
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?

04:42.575 --> 04:45.817
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who Iwanted.

I need to get to a land without magic.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.872
Why would anyone want that?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.168
My business.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.663
You want the ball or not?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.169
Mm... Yes.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.589
Help yourself to as much gold
as you deem appropriate.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.176
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:46.850 --> 12:48.351
Oh, and you.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.143
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.811
Wait, so that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?

12:56.902 --> 13:00.690
So long as you harbor foolish notions
of bringing back the dead,

13:01.490 --> 13:06.154
so long as you live in the past,
you'll never find your future.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.950
Teaching you is a waste of time.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.744
-Pardon me...for eavesdropping,
-(GASPS)

13:16.838 --> 13:21.047
but I think you need
to look elsewhere for assistance.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.385
What do you know about it?

13:22.552 --> 13:23.962
I hear things.

13:25.389 --> 13:29.007
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man
who travels and sees much.

13:29.101 --> 13:32.559
And I know the man
who can do what you want,

13:32.854 --> 13:34.560
bring back the dead.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.981
He's, um, you might say...a wizard.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.480
I can bring him to you.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.692
At what price?

13:44.908 --> 13:46.990
Always a price, indeed. So here's mine.

13:47.077 --> 13:50.695
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and
I've made many enemies along the way.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.156
And I'd like a royal passport,

13:54.251 --> 13:56.708
so I can have free reign
to traverse your kingdom.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.831
How would I do that?

(INHALES AND CLICKS TONGUE)

14:00.799 --> 14:03.757
Well, you're the Queen...aren't you?

14:05.512 --> 14:06.547
That's right, I am.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.849
And this Wizard... (SNIFFS)

14:12.936 --> 14:16.929
Can he really bring someone
back from the dead?

14:18.275 --> 14:21.017
Well, if he can't, no one can.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.789
EMMA: Have you seen him before?

14:36.877 --> 14:38.208
MULAN: Yes, I've seen him around.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.412
He's a blacksmith, came to our camp
a couple of months ago.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.539
Said he lost his hand in an Ogre attack.

14:44.468 --> 14:45.958
Why would Cora leave a survivor?

14:46.053 --> 14:48.715
It's messy. It doesn't make sense.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.840
You think he's lying.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.549
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.224
Here you go.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.055
I cannot thank you enough
for your kindness.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.857
Fortune, it seems,
has seen fit to show me favor.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.563
An island full of corpses,
you're the only one to escape.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.440
How exactly did that happen?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.363
She attacked at night.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.157
Slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.284
When she started
ripping out people's hearts,

15:17.375 --> 15:20.708
I hid under the bodies
of those who had already been killed.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.877
Pretended to be dead myself.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.581
Mercifully, the ruse worked.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.257
So much for fortune favoring the brave.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.084
It was all I could do to survive.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.300
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

15:37.104 --> 15:41.063
I'm pretty good at knowing
when someone is lying to me.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.564
I'm telling you the truth.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.687
We should leave here
in case Cora decides to come back.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.616
We should start searching
for a new portal back to Storybrooke.

15:52.702 --> 15:56.194
I only got about five minutes with my
husband, not to mention my grandson.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.661
You have a grandson?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.201

You promised to bring him to me.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.914
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him.
But I warn you, be cautious.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.459
Is he dangerous?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.591
Not to us.

16:51.845 --> 16:55.008
But bear in mind, he's never been
to a world like this before.

16:55.098 --> 16:58.807
He's unfamiliar with our ways,
with our magic.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.727
All I care about are his ways,
and if they will do what I require.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.931
Well, there's only one way to find out.

Of course. Now... (CLEARS THROAT)

Show me the patient.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.324
It's remarkable.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.788

was drawn just moments ago.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.204
Can you bring him back?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.961
Perhaps. Let's take a look.

18:30.151 --> 18:34.019
It's wonderful. His condition is ideal.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.855
Apart from being dead, that is.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.192
Just how many times
have you done this, Doctor?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.072
You didn't tell her.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.867
Tell... Tell me? Tell me what?

18:46.209 --> 18:49.701
The procedure is experimental.
Success has yet to occur.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.421
But if certain conditions are met,
I'm optimistic.

Optimistic?

18:54.884 --> 18:56.090
Just hear him out.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.550
What kind of charlatan are you?

18:57.887 --> 19:00.378
I am no such thing.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.965
I was told the last crucial piece
of the puzzle exists in this land.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.309
What else do you need?

19:07.522 --> 19:12.232
A heart. It's a fragile organ.
And I need a strong one.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.517

of my realm

19:14.612 --> 19:16.819

to withstand the shock of my procedure.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.442
None have survived.

19:19.576 --> 19:23.740
But they say in your land,
there are hearts transformed by magic.

Hearts made so powerful, they glow.

So, tell me,
how do you change these hearts?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.165
How do you enchant them?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.713
Those who practice the dark arts do it

19:39.804 --> 19:42.295
by ripping the organ
out of the living while it still beats.
