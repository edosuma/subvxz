‐ I wasn't that high.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.099

20:24.099 --> 20:27.102
LIAM: Okay, we're in an Uber
for about 20 minutes.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.645
We slow down into a turn.

This guy jumps out of
the moving vehicle...

20:31.398 --> 20:34.359

jump out of a moving car?

He was so high,

he forgot why we were in the Uber,

21:51.520 --> 21:53.063
tonight is not the night.

21:54.356 --> 21:57.776
Oh. And this steely gaze right here means
