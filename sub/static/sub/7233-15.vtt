Peter Rabbit.

00:02.040 --> 00:03.690
Go on a run.

00:03.690 --> 00:05.630
Run for our lives.

00:05.630 --> 00:08.680
We'll tear a hole in every
fence and every wall.

00:08.680 --> 00:09.400
Peter Rabbit.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.170
Run through the fields.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.300
Run wild and free.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.059
And grab a piece of
every radish that we see.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.050
Peter Rabbit.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.030
Go day and night.

00:19.030 --> 00:20.510
Go for it all.

00:20.510 --> 00:22.490
It's time to fly.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.980
Come on, the wind's
begun to blow.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.730
Let's go. 'Cause you and I we
weren't made for going slow.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.910

00:47.270 --> 00:48.260
Haa.

00:51.230 --> 00:57.290
Uh, think you can wake up a
badger and get away with it?

00:57.290 --> 01:00.110
Ah.

01:00.110 --> 01:02.640
[INAUDIBLE] Oh!

01:02.640 --> 01:03.470
Ah!

01:03.470 --> 01:04.530
Where am I?

01:10.450 --> 01:11.870
Hi, Dad.

01:11.870 --> 01:16.660
Lily Bobtail, do you
know what time it is?

01:16.660 --> 01:20.550
Dinner's been on the
table for half an hour.

01:20.550 --> 01:22.200
Badger.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.360
No, Warren.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.760
We're having carrots and celery.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.910
I mean, I smell badger.

01:28.910 --> 01:29.840
Lily?

01:29.840 --> 01:33.979
All right, maybe I was
chased by Tommy Brock.

01:33.979 --> 01:36.580
But I got away, I'm fine.

01:36.580 --> 01:37.970
That does it.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.880
This valley is
just too dangerous.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.370
I said if there was one
more scrape like this,

01:43.370 --> 01:46.620
one more brush with
badgers, or foxes, or owls,

01:46.620 --> 01:47.320
we were leaving.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.020
But--

01:48.020 --> 01:49.070
Ah, no buts.

01:49.070 --> 01:50.259
My mind is made up.

01:50.259 --> 01:50.960
We're moving.

01:56.660 --> 02:00.250
But how could we be
friends if you move away?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.560
I know, Benjamin.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.620
But my parents don't
think I'm safe here.

02:05.620 --> 02:09.120
Maybe I can come and visit.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.740
Well, I think it's rotten.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.280
What about you, Peter?

02:14.280 --> 02:18.170
What we need is a picnic.

02:18.170 --> 02:19.550
Peter!

02:19.550 --> 02:23.240
How can you even think about
food at a time like this?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.560
I'm moving away.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.640
Listen, we'll have a picnic
and invite your mum and dad.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.180
Show them this is the
safest place in the world.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.260
Aren't you
forgetting something?

02:33.260 --> 02:35.510
It's never safe with
Tommy Brock and Mr.

02:35.510 --> 02:36.880
Tod and Old Brown around.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.730
We just have to make sure they
don't show up to our picnic.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.100
You mean, outdoors?

should take it indoors,

But Dad, picnics
are for outside.

safe elsewhere.

safer somewhere else.

So I suppose we just hold
on to this till we get bored.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.300
So nice.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.900
Hello, you three.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.490
You've been gone a while.

10:44.490 --> 10:46.770
Wait a second.

10:46.770 --> 10:47.840
What's that I smell?

10:50.930 --> 10:53.070
It's blackberries.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.900
We picked plenty for everyone.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.670
You were right, Peter.

10:56.670 --> 10:59.070
They're the best blackberries
I've ever tasted.

10:59.070 --> 11:00.090
Yes, indeed.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.370
It really is a beautiful valley.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.390
Why would we ever want to leave?

11:04.390 --> 11:05.720
We staying?

11:05.720 --> 11:08.230
Yes.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.690
Yahoo, we're staying.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.700
I mean, they're staying.

11:17.700 --> 11:21.490
[CHEERING]

11:21.490 --> 11:24.740
On one condition--

11:24.740 --> 11:27.090
we have picnics more often.

11:27.090 --> 11:28.980
More picnics?

11:28.980 --> 11:29.680
No.

11:33.660 --> 11:39.520
Peter Rabbit, come
back here and untie us.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.220
