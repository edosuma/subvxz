<i>This whole story,</i>

00:56.598 --> 00:59.184
<i>the one you're about</i>
<i>to sit on your fat ass</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:03.938
<i>and watch like a big lump</i>
<i>of nothing, is about me.</i>

01:07.817 --> 01:09.819
<i>Ew! Not her.</i>

01:12.363 --> 01:13.281
<i>Me.</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:15.158
<i>You know me.</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:18.036
<i>Everyone knows me.</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:21.372
<i>I'm an icon.</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:24.459
<i>A legend.</i>

01:28.296 --> 01:30.590
The fake heiress
allegedly scammed her way

01:30.673 --> 01:32.342
through thousands of dollars

01:32.425 --> 01:36.763
in gourmet meals, luxury hotel rooms
and private jet flights.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.808
Sources say
she also conned Manhattan's glitterati,

01:39.891 --> 01:42.352
leaving egg on the faces
of society's biggest players

01:42.435 --> 01:45.772
from the art world, real-estate,
fashion and Wall Street.

01:45.855 --> 01:49.734
<i>That part's all lies, you know.</i>
<i>I did nothing wrong.</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:50.944
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

01:51.027 --> 01:54.948
Anna Delvey's a masterpiece,
bitches, and they can all just fu--

01:57.784 --> 01:59.869
<i>I work for my success.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:02.080
<i>I earn my accomplishments.</i>

02:02.872 --> 02:04.207
<i>Pay attention.</i>

02:04.290 --> 02:06.584
<i>Maybe you'll learn</i>
<i>how to be smart like me.</i>

02:07.502 --> 02:10.797
<i>I doubt it, but you can dream.</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.645
The Manhattan District Attorney's Office

03:07.729 --> 03:11.024
is pleased to announce
the indictment of Anna Sorokin.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.194
Miss Sorokin is also known
by the alias Anna Delvey.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.403
<i>Miss Sorokin is charged</i>

03:15.486 --> 03:17.447
<i>in a New York State</i>
<i>Supreme Court indictment</i>

03:17.530 --> 03:20.700
with two counts of attempted
grand larceny in the first degree,

03:20.783 --> 03:23.328
three counts of grand larceny
in the second degree

03:23.411 --> 03:26.664
<i>and one count of grand larceny</i>
<i>third degree, and theft of services.</i>

03:26.748 --> 03:29.334
Anna Sorokin committed
real white-collar felonies

03:29.417 --> 03:30.877
while posing as a socialite

03:30.960 --> 03:33.922
in an attempt to steal
millions and millions of dollars.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.342
Investigations into her further
criminal activity are ongoing.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.094
If you believe you may have been
a victim of this defendant,

03:40.178 --> 03:42.555
I urge you to call
the financial fraud hotline.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.598
Thank you.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.142
Are you reading it?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.645

<i>That girl's back in New York.</i>

03:48.728 --> 03:51.606
I can't believe it.
How do you think they caught her?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.107
<i>Karma, honey.</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:55.318
The universe corrects all wrongs.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.867
We need to drink about Anna.
Did you see the article?

04:03.534 --> 04:04.577
I never met her.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.621
We never met her.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.248
Darling, it was in the papers.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.877
This could turn into a big, uh, thing.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.755
I have no desire
to be humiliated.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.967
It was one story, one reporter.
<i>The Post</i> of all places.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.969
I mean, no one else
is going to pick this up.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.178
And why would they?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.139
Who on Earth would be interested
in lowly Anna Delvey?

04:25.223 --> 04:27.642
-Nora. Hello, dear.
-Hmm.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.254
-You see anything?
-No assignments on the board yet.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.588
I'm saying it now.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.550
They give me Melania, I'm jumping.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.469
I will not write any more Melania stories.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.638
I miss writing about the Obamas.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.640
I might have a story.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.021
I was thinking,
"What the hell, go in there and pitch it."

05:13.604 --> 05:16.399
-Yeah, get in there. Go.
-Go for it.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.859
-Take a shot.
-Why not?

05:17.942 --> 05:18.860
Okay.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.820
-Come on.
-Okay, fuck it. I'm going in.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.155
-You got it.
-Yeah.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.826
Oh, no. I can't watch.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.787
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.666
Vivian. Uh, we're having a meeting.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.752
I know, and before you got too far,

05:35.835 --> 05:38.046
I wanted to put in
a bid for my next story.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.800
What am I looking at?

05:42.884 --> 05:45.970
Her name is Anna Delvey,
or Anna Sorokin, no one's sure.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.889
She's either a mega rich German heiress,

05:47.972 --> 05:50.308
or she's flat broke,
and maybe she's Russian.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.352
-Vivian, I--
-That's the point, no one knows.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.521
Whoever she is, the DA's office
just extradited her from LA

05:55.605 --> 05:56.939
and she's being arraigned today.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.026
I'm going down to the courthouse now,
so I'm already late.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.694
-I'll be on that.
-Landon…

06:01.778 --> 06:04.447
-Vivian!
-She's on the Wall Street #MeToo story.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.574
And do I really need to be?

06:07.200 --> 06:10.828
-Mmm. That story is--
-Why are you complaining this time?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.456
I gave you something
riveting and provocative.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.500
Yeah, thanks.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.377
I'm asking to be on this instead, Landon.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.672
-Paul assigns your stories.
-Okay, but this is a cover story.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.549
A dumb socialite.
I don't think so.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.802
Just give me a chance to get an interview.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.053
Vivian, uh…

06:27.136 --> 06:30.181
The indictment reads like a novel.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.476
The charges, the arena,
the players are insane.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.188
We're talking big banks,
financial advisors, hedge funds,

06:37.271 --> 06:40.650
law firms, real-estate developers,
philanthropists, galleries,

06:40.733 --> 06:42.819
art dealers, all of Fashion Week,

06:42.902 --> 06:47.240
and half of New York society,
and she's 26 years old.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.827
I couldn't tie my own shoes at 26.
You know I give good story.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.204
Let me do this.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.707
Paul assigns your stories.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.292
Wall Street, #MeToo.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.380
Fine.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.881
I want copy in three weeks.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.007
No problem.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.405
We want her remanded, Your Honor.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.448
No bail? Come on!

07:28.531 --> 07:31.200
Your Honor, we all know
the reason she is in court

07:31.284 --> 07:33.536
is because you allowed us
to hunt and capture her.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.079
Remand is warranted, Your Honor.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.207
-Your Honor, she's--
-She's a flight risk. DA's office will ask

07:38.291 --> 07:40.209
for a substantial
prison sentence in this case.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.128
Remand is more
than appropriate in this case.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.589
My client has every intention
of coming back to court.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.884
Your Honor, she's a young,
vulnerable, nonviolent offender.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.387
Set a reasonable bail
and I will surrender her passport,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.973
and then she will be able
to assist me in her own defense,

07:54.056 --> 07:57.351
which will take a tremendous amount
of work, given the financial charges.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.192
Miss Sorokin,
Mr. Spodek asked me to consider bail.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.902
I am. I have.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.737
I have no confidence whatsoever

08:07.820 --> 08:10.448
in you returning
to this jurisdiction to face the music.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.200
None, zero.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.745
I am remanding you
to Rikers Island until trial.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.330
Remand, take charge.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.711
-You put up a good fight in there.
-Thanks.

08:23.794 --> 08:27.798
I can't imagine a young woman her age
having to spend time at Rikers like that.

08:27.882 --> 08:28.716
Happens.

08:28.799 --> 08:31.260
I didn't notice
if she had family in the courtroom.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.470
I have no comment.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.056
-I didn't ask for one.
-But you were going to.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.518
Just wondering if you have any idea
how she got mixed up in all of this.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.477
No comment.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.145
Those are some pretty serious charges

08:41.229 --> 08:44.774
and they involve two of the world's
largest banks, not to mention Fortress.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.151
Fortress is true
power player private equity.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.446
That is not a sandbox
most 26-year-olds would ever play in,

08:50.530 --> 08:53.533
would ever even know existed, but she did.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.992
How did she know Fortress?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.203
-No comment.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.957
I just… I would really love
an opportunity to sit down with Anna.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.333
That won't happen.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.419
<i>The Post</i> has done two stories
calling her a "wannabe socialite."

09:05.503 --> 09:06.712
No one reads <i>The Post.</i>

09:06.796 --> 09:09.757
Jurors read <i>The Post,</i>
and <i>The Post</i> is making fun of her.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.260
Dumb socialite?
There's no way they have it right.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.929
That girl is not dumb.
I don't know what, but not dumb.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.098
-Look, I--
-She deserves to have her story told.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.726
One interview.
All I'm asking is that you talk to her.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.852
Let her decide.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.564
Who are you?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.567
Vivian Kent. Vivian.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.193
Vivian Kent, Vivian.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.613
I'm going to keep walking
in this direction, and you are not.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.924
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

09:52.592 --> 09:56.512
I was sitting in a waiting room
full of pregnant women, by myself.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.766
I'm so, so, so sorry.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.643
I spent the afternoon looking like some

10:02.727 --> 10:07.732
molesting pregnancy fetish pervert
to everyone at Dr. Harris' office.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.526
Forks.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.698
Again, I am sorry.

10:16.741 --> 10:21.287
-I just… just got caught up.
-Not enough.

10:22.663 --> 10:26.751
It's a good story. Anna's really a…

10:26.834 --> 10:28.127
I don't know. She's remarkable.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.588
Anna's in jail.
You know what's remarkable?

10:30.671 --> 10:33.799
Pulling yourself up by your bootstraps,
working for what you have,

10:33.883 --> 10:35.718
showing up to ultrasound appointments.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.347
This was worth missing
an appointment about genitals.

10:44.101 --> 10:44.977
All right.

10:45.770 --> 10:46.604
Go.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.855
Fortress.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.860
No one gets into Fortress without keys,
and the only keys are money or power.

10:52.943 --> 10:56.113
If Anna did it, she displayed
some amazing financial talents.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.281
Even if she didn't do it,

10:57.365 --> 10:59.742
she displayed
some amazing financial talents.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.203
Plus, she was in New York society.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.080
That's, like, a closed world.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.749
Either she truly belonged there
or she fooled her way in.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.584
One way or the other it's a real story.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.671
You should've seen Paul's face.
"Wall Street, #MeToo." Bleurgh!

11:14.423 --> 11:16.509
You know, you don't
have to put up with Paul.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.513
Oh, my God, please don't start.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.639
I'm just saying,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.934
maybe you're overestimating
how big a deal it was.

11:28.145 --> 11:28.979
I'm not.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.274
Okay? Drop it.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.777
Just trying to help.

11:47.415 --> 11:51.210
<i>Dear Anna, I'm a features writer</i>
<i>at</i> Manhattan Magazine.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.628
<i>I read a bit about your story.</i>

11:52.712 --> 11:54.672
<i>The papers have not done you justice.</i>

11:54.755 --> 11:57.049
<i>The few details I can find</i>
<i>are so compelling</i>

11:57.133 --> 11:59.135

12:02.263 --> 12:03.431
"Brilliant and interesting"?

12:04.390 --> 12:05.349
Too much?

12:07.685 --> 12:09.103
Flattery will get you everywhere.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.022
<i>…brilliant and interesting woman</i>
<i>behind all of this.</i>

12:12.106 --> 12:15.484

<i>Best regards, Vivian Kent.</i>

12:40.468 --> 12:41.427
What…

12:44.388 --> 12:45.306
Hello?

12:48.434 --> 12:52.730
Yes. Yes, I will accept
a call from Rikers Island.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.817
<i>Hello, this is Vivian Kent.</i>

12:56.901 --> 12:58.903
Vivian. It's Anna Delvey.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.390
Place your thumb
on that scanner.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.100
Go wait for the bus marked Rosie.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.394
-Another bus?
-A lot of buses here.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.861
Pass.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.824
Wondering how long the wait will be?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.200
It takes as long as it takes.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.828
It's just 'cause the baby gets hungry.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.497
It takes as long as it takes.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.470
It's a nice day.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.350
Come on, Spodek, I'm living my life.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.602
Why do you come here? There are phones.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.229
Because you need to see this face.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.398
Look at this face.
Who could say no to this face?

14:17.481 --> 14:19.316
Want me to answer
that in front of your kid?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.444
Catherine, you don't
want to try this case.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.280
Oh, but I do. She's a criminal.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.866
She stole from the biggest
banks and hotels in the city.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.327
Allegedly. And everyone hates banks
and everyone thinks hotels overcharge.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.080
-That is a load of bull--
-Shorts!

14:33.163 --> 14:37.418
Someone repeats all kinds of words,
so "bull-shorts."

14:37.501 --> 14:39.753
Bull-shorts, fine.

14:39.837 --> 14:40.838
Todd, come on.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.299
These banks, these hotels,
she embarrassed them.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.759
I can't drop the charges,
SI would have my head.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.761
Also, I don't want to.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.556
She is everything that is wrong
with America right now,

14:50.639 --> 14:52.057
and she's not even American.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.642
No one's going to convict her.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.895
She's Robin Hood, she's a folk hero.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.187
She's a little…

14:58.105 --> 14:59.565
bit of a scam artist.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.233
She's a sweet, nice girl.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.029
Now that is sexist.
Anna is what a criminal looks like.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.573
I don't think you have this one right,
for what it's worth.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.326
But okay, I tried. Daddy tried, right?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.368
Daddy tried.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.287
See you in court.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.627
Todd, have you thought about
helping her get a different attorney?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.254
No, Catherine, I have not.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.882
I don't mean to be insulting, I don't.
You know me.

15:25.925 --> 15:31.889
It's just, I know your wheelhouse
and I respect it, but it's not this.

15:31.972 --> 15:32.973
I'm concerned.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.226
Flake you, Catherine.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.730
There are over 11,000 pages of discovery.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.651
I have seven people on this legal team.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.070
This is deep water.
I'm trying to throw you a lifeline.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.447
What?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.659
I'll get you a plea offer,
you take it to her,

15:51.742 --> 15:53.535
we close this whole thing up quickly.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.788
Avoid a flaking trial.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.671
<i>I'm scheduled on</i>
<i>your 10:00 a.m. flight to Kansas City.</i>

16:03.754 --> 16:06.340
<i>I wondered</i>
<i>could I have switched to a later flight…</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:07.758
Sorokin.

16:08.550 --> 16:09.593
Sorokin.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.887
Me, that's me.

16:23.023 --> 16:23.857
Oh!

16:43.919 --> 16:45.004
Right over there.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.137
Vivian, thank you so much for coming.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.555
Hi, Anna.

16:54.638 --> 16:58.142
It's nice to meet you.
How are you doing? Are you okay?

16:58.892 --> 17:02.271
I'm okay. I'm just really glad you came.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.399
I know you said you would come,

17:05.482 --> 17:10.154
but then I was told media visits
take a long time to schedule, so…

17:13.198 --> 17:15.117
But it didn't take you any time at all.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.828
I didn't come on a media visit.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.122
-It's so much red tape.
-Hmm.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.458
So this is just a regular visit?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.293
Yes. It's so much quicker.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.341
See, with a media visit, a journalist
needs all kinds of permissions,

17:31.425 --> 17:34.344
but really,
any regular person can visit an inmate.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.513
So I just got on the bus and here I am.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.766
Oh, okay.

17:43.395 --> 17:49.151
So, I know you want to do
an interview and I just… I don't, um…

17:50.486 --> 17:53.238
I don't know if I like, I just don't want…

17:53.322 --> 17:56.825
You don't have to agree to anything now.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.578
We'll just talk on background,

17:59.661 --> 18:02.831
meaning I can't quote you
or give any indication that we spoke.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.293
We'll just get to know each other
and then you can decide. Okay?

18:06.376 --> 18:07.294
Okay.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.714
That woman, that prosecutor?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.634
-The ADA, Catherine McCaw?
-Yes, McCaw.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.386
McCaw is painting a public picture of me

18:16.470 --> 18:21.600
as a dumb, shallow,
superficial person who's just after money.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.021
I want you to know that's not me at all.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.774
I'm not some party girl.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.693
I'm trying to build a business.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.861
Okay.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.947
I mean, even the name thing.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.949
She said I was using an alias.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.450
It's crazy.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.121
Delvey isn't an alias.
It's my mom's maiden name.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.039
Of course.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.710
Anna, if you could give me some names,

18:48.794 --> 18:51.505
people I can talk to,
friends, business associates,

18:51.588 --> 18:54.424
anyone who could
corroborate your side of things,

18:54.508 --> 18:56.468
it would really help the interview.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.097
You said this was
off the record until I agreed?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.557
Right.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.767
It's just, I thought if there was a way

19:03.851 --> 19:06.478
to help prove
you have the funds you say you have--

19:06.562 --> 19:08.772
Money is not an issue for me.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.943
And if the prosecutors are doubting me,
if they think I don't have money,

19:13.026 --> 19:15.487
"Oh, she can't pay for anything,"

19:15.571 --> 19:17.197
why not give me bail and see?

19:17.698 --> 19:22.578
If I was such a fraud, it would be such
an easy test. "Can she bail herself out?"

19:22.661 --> 19:25.956
Try me and see. Instead, I'm in here.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.132
Um…

19:35.716 --> 19:38.844
I wake up in the mornings now,

19:38.927 --> 19:44.266
and every time
I think I had the most horrible dream.

19:44.933 --> 19:50.147
And then there's a noise or a smell,

19:50.230 --> 19:55.194
or I… I…
I catch a glimpse of the bars

19:55.277 --> 19:57.529
out of the corner of my eye, and…

20:00.199 --> 20:03.285
I realize this is…
this is really happening.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.332
Anna, are you okay in here?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.959
I mean, are you safe?

20:11.710 --> 20:14.671
This place is just,
it's… It's…

20:14.755 --> 20:17.382
It's very different from real life

20:17.466 --> 20:21.053
and I'm not talking about
a certain standard of living.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.429
I'm not spoiled.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.478
There are girls in here
who are criminals,

20:29.561 --> 20:32.689
like, they're dangerous people.

20:32.773 --> 20:37.027
Vivian, I didn't do anything wrong.

20:37.110 --> 20:41.156
I didn't do
what the prosecutor is saying I did.

20:42.783 --> 20:47.621
This… This whole thing
is some kind of… misunderstanding.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.249
I… I don't belong in here.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.419
I don't know if I can make it.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.964
It's going to be okay.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.802
It might not seem like it now,
but it will be okay.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.179
-It's gonna be okay.
-No touching.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.440
-Vivian?
-Yes?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.901
Are you… Are you…

21:17.985 --> 21:22.239
Are you pregnant
or are you just so very, very fat?

21:26.535 --> 21:27.411
Pregnant.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.663
Okay.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.018
-What you up to, kid?
-Nothing.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.148
-Where were you yesterday?
-At the doctor's.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.816
Follow-up question, all day?

21:58.483 --> 22:03.155
No, I also interviewed people
for the Wall Street piece.

22:03.864 --> 22:08.160
A lot of #MeToo stories.
I needed to take it all in.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.583
Fuck me.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.293
You went to Rikers.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.462
Anna answered your letter
and you went to Rikers.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.630
Yes. You went rogue. Good girl.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.884
-Fight the power, woman.
-Keep your voices down.

22:23.967 --> 22:24.801
I'm impressed.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.221
Paul's gonna grind your bones for bread
when he catches you, but still.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.681
He's not gonna catch her.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.392
Stop humping your Pulitzers
and get over here and help.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.477
What do you need?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.979
These are the court records
on Anna so far.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.358
They tell me nothing.

22:39.441 --> 22:43.570
I have no leads,
no real idea who she socialized with,

22:43.653 --> 22:47.199
who her friends are. I need to find
someone who can talk to me about Anna.

22:47.282 --> 22:50.243
I need sources, I need names.
It's all John Does in here.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.954
Fatima, what are they doing?

22:54.414 --> 22:59.044
Well, I mean, they're writers.
So, writing.

23:06.009 --> 23:09.513
The one person who knows all the names
behind the Does is the prosecutor.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.431
How loose is the ADA on the case?

23:13.850 --> 23:14.810
No.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.937
I'm not asking you
to talk about the trial,

23:17.020 --> 23:19.356
or give me a witness list,
or anything official.

23:19.439 --> 23:23.944
I'm just looking
for some color on the case.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.905
Color on the case? No.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.826
No one's gonna just talk, not rich people.
You have to smoke 'em out.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.828
The banks listed in the indictment.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.623
Have you called the asset managers
to see if they'll break?

23:36.706 --> 23:39.167
There's usually one set of loose lips.

23:40.043 --> 23:43.296
Anna Delvey, or maybe it was Anna Sorokin?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.965
She was a client of yours.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.008
Thank you, yes, I'm happy to hold.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.011
I was just speaking with you,

23:50.095 --> 23:52.848
and maybe something happened
when you put me on hold because…

23:52.931 --> 23:54.933
Well, I… Sure, I'll hold.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.018
Vivian Kent again.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.479
No, do not put me on hold.
Do not put me on…

24:00.147 --> 24:01.648
No. No, I do not want to hold.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.359
I am done with the holding. I…

24:10.949 --> 24:12.868
Anna's not giving up info?

24:13.535 --> 24:15.871
Anna hasn't even
agreed to the interview yet.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.896
-Hey.
-You're late.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.983
-Kids?
-Uh, your mother took them.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.152
Ula put out clothes for you.
It's black tie.

24:47.235 --> 24:50.030
-What are we doing?
-Opening night at Ailee.

24:50.697 --> 24:51.573
Right.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.622
McCaw offered me a deal.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.416
Sorokin case? That's great.

25:02.542 --> 25:06.046
It's a good deal.
Probably the best she can hope for.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.255
Is she taking it?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.676
-I haven't told her about it yet.
-When did you get the offer?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.720
-Saturday.
-Saturday?

25:14.846 --> 25:18.016
Babe, you have a duty
as an officer of the court.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.185
It could be considered
malpractice to withhold--

25:20.268 --> 25:23.647
I know the law.
Obviously, I'm going to take it to her.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.565
Forget it. I'm just…

25:26.233 --> 25:28.068
I'm just tired.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.158
What are you doing?
I thought we were late.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.036
We are late. But clearly
we need to figure some shit out.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.080
Start talking, mister.

25:43.291 --> 25:47.003
-You work at a big firm.
-I work for my father's firm.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.005
And I work in a WeWork.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.842
My last big client was a woman who claimed
she was the love child of a president.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.845
-She was a joke.
-Hey, she did look a little like him.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.100
-Mags, this case.
-Mmm.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.018
It's a complicated case.

26:02.102 --> 26:06.565
There are financial documents
and international banking statements,

26:06.648 --> 26:09.025
and it's just me and Alexi in the office.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.778
You know how much discovery
that is to discovery?

26:13.446 --> 26:15.282
We can't handle that kind of volume.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.787
Whatever the deal is,
she should probably take it. She should.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.038
Catherine's decent.

26:22.122 --> 26:24.833
Knowing her, it'll be a good deal.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.918
A deal worth taking.

26:28.086 --> 26:32.632
So… why don't you want her to?

26:37.512 --> 26:39.347
Sometimes I put on that tux,

26:40.557 --> 26:42.225
I go with you to these events,

26:43.393 --> 26:46.104
and even though
I'm with Margaret Vanderburn-Porter

26:46.187 --> 26:47.606
of the New York Porters,

26:47.689 --> 26:50.859
and even though that tuxedo cost more
than some people make in a month…

26:50.942 --> 26:51.776
Don't be gross.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.738
…even then,
I still feel like one of the valets.

26:54.821 --> 26:55.947
Mmm.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.243
Like I'm back in Long Island, and I'm…

27:01.536 --> 27:03.913
parking cars to help my ma pay the rent.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.129
Like our friends should be
tossing me their keys and giving me tips.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.464
Honey.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.636
Anna doesn't need her car parked.

27:20.055 --> 27:20.889
Hey.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.159
-You've been out a lot.
-Sorry.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.410
Where were you?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.412
I was chasing a Wall Street lead.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.955
You got anything good?

27:46.039 --> 27:48.500
Yeah, a great one. Super #MeToo.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.169
Vivian, there you are.

27:51.252 --> 27:54.547
Listen, the DA's office called Landon
about some fake socialite case.

27:54.631 --> 27:57.092
He wasn't in,
but I guess the ADA wanted to…

27:57.175 --> 27:58.176
I wrote it down.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.969
"Following a visit from Vivian Kent,

28:00.053 --> 28:02.347
I want to formally register
that the DA's office

28:02.430 --> 28:06.101
has no comment on the case involving
the scam artist known as Anna Sorokin,

28:06.184 --> 28:08.061
AKA Anna Delvey."

28:08.144 --> 28:10.355
-Does this make sense?
-Yes, it's, um…

28:10.438 --> 28:13.817
You know what?
I'll take care of it. Thanks, Fatima.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.538
Shit.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.458
-She deliberately defied me.
-I wasn't trying to--

28:30.542 --> 28:33.878
You misled me. She's supposed to be
on the Wall Street #MeToo story.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.171
Can we talk about that though?

28:35.255 --> 28:39.509
She can't just assign herself stories
and brag about it, like she knows best.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.929
I don't brag.
How can you justify doing that story?

28:43.012 --> 28:46.182
Right, tell me, Vivian.
What can you possibly have against

28:46.266 --> 28:48.393
the women of Wall Street
proclaiming #MeToo?

28:48.476 --> 28:52.564
Nothing, but the women of Wall Street
are not proclaiming #MeToo.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.607
They are scared to death for their jobs,

28:54.691 --> 28:57.986
and seeing therapists, and trying
to cope with handsy assholes

28:58.069 --> 29:00.488
and you want to launch
a woman journalist grenade

29:00.572 --> 29:03.241
to bully them into
telling their stories to the public

29:03.324 --> 29:06.369
until these women are traumatized
and their careers are pulverized.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.831
I'm not against the women.
I'm against you using them for clickbait.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.463
This is what I mean.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.715
She thinks she's above the rules.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.134
Can we have the room?

29:22.427 --> 29:23.344
Paul?

29:24.137 --> 29:25.346
One minute.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.366
Why is everything so difficult?

29:46.034 --> 29:49.287
He was your guy on Harvey
and he said there was nothing there.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.998
Who looks at Harvey and finds nothing?

29:52.081 --> 29:54.751
Jodi and Megan and Ronan
found a fucking Pulitzer's worth.

29:54.834 --> 29:59.130
And now, after everyone else has done
#MeToo, every daily, weekly, monthly,

29:59.214 --> 30:01.549
hell, Oprah came out
of retirement, Time's Up…

30:01.633 --> 30:04.344
Now he wants in? Now?
When it doesn't matter.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.513
When there's a comfortable
bandwagon to get on.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.848
-That's not fair.
-I'm not doing it.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.562
I want a real story with teeth.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.105
That's not your call.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.441
I went to Rikers, Landon.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.361
I interviewed Anna.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.364
She gave you an interview?

30:25.490 --> 30:28.451
-Before trial?
-I'm telling you, there's something there.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.998
Paul assigns the features.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.126
Paul never assigns me anything decent.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.338
-Paul moved my desk out to Scriberia.
-Scriberia?

30:40.421 --> 30:42.006
Where you send the old writers to die.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.384
We don't have a place
we send writers to die.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.554
The back left corner of the office,
that part that gets no sunlight.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.390
Full of the old crankies,
who are, by the way, amazing writers.

30:50.473 --> 30:51.975
That is Scriberia.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.394
Everybody knows it. Paul certainly does,

30:54.477 --> 30:56.729
and he sent me there
and he's waiting for me to die.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.190
I am bubble-wrapped
from any good stories. Landon--

30:59.274 --> 31:01.484
Paul is perhaps being cautious.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.612
Given the history.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.865
-There is no history.
-There is a history.

31:06.948 --> 31:10.076
-There is no history.
-The article.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.579
-It was nothing. You know that.
-It was something.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.122
-It was nothing.
-It was something.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.206
It was Paul.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.169
We're going to have to continue
to agree to disagree.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.016
Give me a month.
One month on this Anna story.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.768
Let me do this
before someone else beats us to it.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.478
-Vivian--
-You owe me one.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.066
This is my one.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.741
Two weeks, but make good.

31:50.575 --> 31:54.913
An exclusive interview
with this woman, and be well-sourced.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.167
Two weeks. Show me something.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.003
Or I will let Paul reassign you.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.306
You gave in.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.935
A couple more months,
she'll be out on maternity leave.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.357
What about this?

32:23.691 --> 32:25.652
You tell Paul to go fuck himself,

32:26.235 --> 32:30.531
take the year off, have a baby, and then
get back out there and look for a job.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.951
I do not like your face.

32:35.578 --> 32:36.496
People forget.

32:36.579 --> 32:40.208
People forget, but people use Google.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.711
And Google… What?
What do I always say about Google?

32:43.795 --> 32:45.964
-Google never forgets.
-Google never forgets.

32:46.047 --> 32:49.258
You know this. No other news outlet
is going to hire me, Jack.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.932
I'm getting the interview. Okay?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.309
-Okay.
-Okay.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.401
What about the hotel?

33:07.318 --> 33:10.363
I thought of that. The Beekman, the W…

33:10.446 --> 33:14.492
There's a bunch of 'em listed
as filing charges for not being paid,

33:14.575 --> 33:16.786
but she was in and out of each one.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.121
A few days at most.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.082
Nobody there knew her enough
to remember if she had guests.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.918
Not the hotels that filed charges,
I mean the one that didn't.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.087
12 George Hotel.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.090
According to this,
Anna stayed there for months.

33:44.897 --> 33:45.773
Yeah.

33:45.857 --> 33:50.236
I could get in
a lot of trouble for this, you know.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.213
-Yeah, this is bigger than my apartment.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:09.297 --> 34:13.801
It's $1,700 a night.
Not even one of our suites.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.555
$1,700 a night.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.807
Anna's bill must have been huge.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.017
And she paid it?

34:21.100 --> 34:25.188
She paid, every dime.
And she tipped with $100 bills.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.191
I read they're saying
she's a scammer, but…

34:28.858 --> 34:31.444
Anna Delvey is legend around here.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.779
We saw that money.

34:32.862 --> 34:33.863
Did you know her?

34:33.946 --> 34:35.990
I don't fraternize with guests.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.619
Can you remember any friends
or people who visited her?

34:39.702 --> 34:42.455
I don't fraternize with guests.
It's against the rules.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.416
I got to get back.
So you want to take a selfie or what?

34:46.209 --> 34:47.835
Anna took selfies all over this place.

35:35.591 --> 35:39.720
Hi, I'm calling because
I'm doing a story on Anna Delvey.

35:39.804 --> 35:43.057
I know that you and Anna
got together socially a number of times.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.226
Oh, because it's on Instagram.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.519
<i>On Instagram.</i>

35:47.770 --> 35:49.939
<i>No, it's definitely you.</i>

35:51.065 --> 35:52.024
<i>I'm sure.</i>

35:53.943 --> 35:55.361
Hi, I'm Vivian.

35:55.444 --> 36:00.116
<i>I'm sure. Over 30 photos</i>
<i>of the two of you together on Instagram.</i>

36:00.199 --> 36:04.537
Instagram. Instagram. Instagram.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.875
<i>I'd hate to link you to Anna in an article</i>
<i>without hearing your point of view.</i>

36:08.958 --> 36:10.585
I will, but I'd hate to.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.339
Great. I'll see you there.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.967
Her family is the Delvey family.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.344
The one big in antiques. German.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.722
There's a trust fund. That's all I know.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.308
She's Russian,
her father's a major money guy.

36:25.391 --> 36:29.228
Something about solar.
Very rich, that's what she told me.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.855
This is the situation.

36:30.938 --> 36:33.357
Her family had some impressionist painting

36:33.441 --> 36:37.111
that was supposed to be sold
for about 42 mill when Anna turned 25,

36:37.195 --> 36:39.697
and she and her brother
were going to split the proceeds.

36:40.990 --> 36:45.077
It was real. I saw the piece.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.747
I think I did.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.082
I'll say this for Anna.
The bitch knew how to dress.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.501
Chic Parisian couture.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.921
Rick Owens, Zara off the rack.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.048
For someone with money,
I didn't understand it.

36:57.131 --> 36:59.091
But she had more clothes
than anyone ever, so…

36:59.175 --> 37:02.303
She wore the same
black dress over and over.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.514
She looked like
this little Barbie Doll. Cute.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.725
She had something, you know?

37:11.354 --> 37:12.313
Anna?

37:12.897 --> 37:14.732
She and I made out a couple times

37:14.815 --> 37:17.860
and I can tell you,
I wasn't the first girl she'd been with.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.445
She's hot.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.780
She told me everything,

37:20.863 --> 37:24.867
and I'm telling you,
Anna Delvey had no use for sex.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.452
She was not into it.

37:26.535 --> 37:30.081
Anna was from another planet
when it came to normal bodily urges.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.208
She came for a meeting at our office.

37:32.291 --> 37:35.086
She used my bathroom
and I didn't have any toilet paper,

37:35.169 --> 37:37.505
and she did a number two.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.383
She came down
and spent time in the meeting

37:40.466 --> 37:44.887
and the odor was incredible.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.639
The odor was so bad,

37:46.722 --> 37:49.976
I said, "There is something
wrong with this human being."

37:50.059 --> 37:52.937
Anna scares the shit out of me.
I still have nightmares.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.023
My God, all this time she was a fake.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.693
Her face was basic, peasant face,

37:59.777 --> 38:02.405
which is how you know
she was legitimately wealthy.

38:02.488 --> 38:05.074
No one who looked like that
could get away with being poor,

38:05.157 --> 38:06.534
not in our world.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.078
In a sick way, I wish I knew her better.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.628
How much of the nursery did you paint?

38:17.712 --> 38:19.797
-Just the one wall. Why?
-Huh.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.143
Selfies from Instagram.

38:33.227 --> 38:36.022
This is Anna, and this is Anna.

38:37.023 --> 38:42.111
And this is Anna, and this is Anna,
and this is Anna, and this is Anna.

38:42.194 --> 38:46.907
Anna, Anna, Anna,
Anna, Anna, Anna!

38:46.991 --> 38:49.118
All taken within the last five years.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.412
-Holy shit.
-Who is she?

38:51.495 --> 38:53.039
How many Annas is she?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.458
Who the hell is Anna Delvey?

39:03.924 --> 39:05.301
You're good.

39:06.218 --> 39:10.097
-Your visitor pass. Do not lose it.
-Lose it. Got it. Bus marked "Rosie"?

39:16.937 --> 39:18.564
Sorokin.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.446
You're here on a regular visit again?

39:25.529 --> 39:26.364
I'm sorry?

39:26.447 --> 39:28.991
Regular visits, media visits.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.369
You're here on a regular visit.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.205
Yes. Like I said before,

39:34.288 --> 39:36.499
there are procedures
for getting a media visit.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.751
So a regular visit
is the fastest, easiest to--

39:38.834 --> 39:41.670
On a media visit
they put us in a private room.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.716
I think we're good,
not that many people in here today.

39:46.592 --> 39:50.388
So, anyway, I just had some questions.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.348
Is that okay?

39:53.516 --> 39:57.728
I've been trying to get some other
interviews to help corroborate your story.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.105
You don't believe me?

39:59.605 --> 40:02.525
It's not that.
It's just for a story like this,

40:02.608 --> 40:04.276
a journalist needs other sources.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.278
To give the story credibility.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.905
Oh.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.615
So I made progress.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.326
I spoke to a number
of your friends and associates.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.580
You know some very interesting
and accomplished people.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.166
They all had lots to say about you,

40:19.250 --> 40:22.294
but there did seem to be some
confusion over certain things.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.712
Did you ride the bus?

40:24.380 --> 40:25.589
What?

40:25.673 --> 40:26.841
The bus.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.260
Did you take that white Rikers bus here?

40:30.594 --> 40:31.679
Well, yeah.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.265
You don't have to take the bus
on a media visit.

40:34.348 --> 40:36.684
They drive you, it's VIP.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.228
Okay.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.691
Anna, I want to clarify
some of this confusion.

40:43.774 --> 40:48.696
Everyone I spoke to, every single person,
describes you very differently.

40:48.779 --> 40:53.159
Almost as if all of them were talking
about a lot of different people,

40:53.826 --> 40:55.619
instead of just one person.

40:59.748 --> 41:00.958
What do you think about that?

41:01.792 --> 41:04.545
Who exactly did you talk to,
and what they say?

41:05.421 --> 41:07.423
I don't have my notes,
so I can't say exactly.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.885
On a media visit, they let you
bring in papers and notebooks.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.346
I'll keep that in mind.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.349
They were talking about things
like how you dress.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.059
Totally varying descriptions.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.021
Do you have any idea why that would be?

41:24.482 --> 41:25.733
Or your dating habits?

41:29.445 --> 41:30.613
Here's a big one.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.033
Everyone told me a different story about
where your family money comes from.

41:34.116 --> 41:34.992
If we could clear--

41:35.075 --> 41:38.454
On a media visit, they even let you
bring a recording device,

41:38.537 --> 41:43.334
and our visit time isn't limited
to 40 minutes because it's VIP.

41:43.417 --> 41:47.546
You rode that bus.
Don't you know how VIP works?

41:47.630 --> 41:51.133
I do know, but VIP comes with rules.

41:51.884 --> 41:55.679
For a media visit, I would have to
put in an official written request

41:55.763 --> 41:59.058
and then wait for approval
and that can take weeks.

41:59.725 --> 42:01.477
Sometimes, VIP isn't better.

42:02.645 --> 42:06.357
Anna, can you answer
any of these questions?

42:06.440 --> 42:07.691
Just talk a little bit

42:07.775 --> 42:10.945
about why everyone
has a different description of you?

42:13.113 --> 42:14.740
I have a question.

42:14.823 --> 42:15.950
Okay.

42:16.659 --> 42:18.536
I read some stuff about you.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.330
Lots of people
have read some stuff about me.

42:21.413 --> 42:23.624
-That's not a question.
-Well, I have a question.

42:23.707 --> 42:24.750
Okay.

42:28.587 --> 42:30.506
-What?
-Nothing.

42:30.589 --> 42:33.092
No, why is your face like that?

42:35.678 --> 42:39.765
Fine, you looked me up
and you read some stuff about me,

42:39.848 --> 42:41.850
and now you want to ask me a question.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.398
That's not new. I usually get either
"What happened to the kid in the story?"

42:47.481 --> 42:48.440
"Where is he now?"

42:48.524 --> 42:51.110
Or I get
"Did Bloomberg really offer me a job

42:51.193 --> 42:53.404
and then after everything
came out, take it back?"

42:54.655 --> 42:56.740
It's always some version of one of those.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.286
And, yes,
I can tell you they took the job back,

43:00.369 --> 43:02.454
and, no,
I don't know what happened to the kid.

43:03.038 --> 43:06.375
That answer your question?
Because I would love to move on to you.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.752
That wasn't my question.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.672
What do you want to ask me?

43:12.464 --> 43:16.385
I looked at some stuff
about you from the Internet

43:16.468 --> 43:19.179
and I see some pictures,

43:19.972 --> 43:23.934
and I wonder what do you wear?

43:24.893 --> 43:25.853
Huh?

43:25.936 --> 43:27.688
Why do you dress like that?

43:27.771 --> 43:28.772
Like…

43:28.856 --> 43:30.524
Like that?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.360
What are you wearing? You look poor.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.405
I…

43:37.072 --> 43:38.324
This is a nice…

43:39.199 --> 43:40.075
I'm…

43:40.159 --> 43:42.369
I'm pregnant.
Maternity clothes are hard to…

43:44.163 --> 43:45.664
I'm dressed down for prison.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.250
No, you need to get better clothes.

43:48.334 --> 43:54.590
You could get Scalia,
Herrera, Dior, Valentino,

43:55.257 --> 43:59.386
mmm, maybe,
and Chanel makes perfect flats.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.473
Your feet are too fat for heels.

44:02.556 --> 44:05.392
But this, no. You look broke-ass.

44:06.060 --> 44:10.022
Anna. You're wearing,
what are those? Coveralls?

44:10.105 --> 44:14.151
I'm in prison, but I still accessorized it
and had it pressed.

44:17.404 --> 44:20.240
Anna, can you answer some of my questions?

44:24.662 --> 44:27.498
I haven't agreed
to be interviewed by you yet,

44:28.666 --> 44:33.212
but still, mmm, what's the words…

44:33.796 --> 44:35.506
On background.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.096
Anna.

44:42.179 --> 44:46.892
You know, Todd told me
McCaw's offering me a plea deal.

44:46.975 --> 44:49.561
I'm considering it. It's pretty good.

44:49.645 --> 44:50.979
I might take it.

44:51.063 --> 44:54.733
I hate to,
but it could be the smart way to go.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.568
-Anna!
-Bye.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.113
VIP is always better, Vivian.

44:59.196 --> 45:01.323
You just have to be
willing to do the work.

45:13.502 --> 45:14.837
I stuck to the facts,

45:15.462 --> 45:19.425
I laid out all the details of the plea
agreement and let her decide.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.760
Take the plea or go to trial, her choice.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.095
Hmm.

45:23.178 --> 45:25.222
-And?
-I mean, she's thinking about it.

45:26.432 --> 45:27.266
Yes.

45:27.975 --> 45:31.019
She's gonna call me when she knows
what she wants to do. So…

45:31.103 --> 45:33.856
What do you want her to do?
What do you hope she'll do?

45:35.274 --> 45:38.152
If she takes the plea,
I don't have to try the case.

45:38.235 --> 45:39.653
Is it better to go to trial?

45:39.737 --> 45:43.991
Yeah, if I win, for both of us.
It's amazing if I win.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.952
-But if I lose…
-Hmm.

45:48.078 --> 45:51.290
The plea, it's… it's safer.

45:51.373 --> 45:54.626
Anna at least knows
when she's going to get out.

45:54.710 --> 45:57.129
I know I didn't do anything
to keep her in there longer.

45:57.212 --> 45:58.964
Publicly, I don't take a hit.

45:59.047 --> 46:01.258
Is that better for Anna's future? Maybe?

46:01.341 --> 46:04.011
I mean, I honestly
don't even know what I'm rooting for.

46:06.513 --> 46:08.307
It's Aggie and popsicles.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.185
She never knows
if she wants purple or red,

46:11.268 --> 46:14.354
so she lets Brian choose,
and the minute he does,

46:14.438 --> 46:17.107
she gets a feeling.
She's either happy or mad.

46:19.234 --> 46:20.569
Anna will make a choice.

46:21.945 --> 46:25.908
And then you'll know how you feel,
one way or the other.

46:25.991 --> 46:26.992
I know.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.915
Do you think we'll get
to sleep in our bed?

46:32.998 --> 46:34.333
No.

46:34.416 --> 46:36.335
The bitch is psycho screwing you.

46:36.418 --> 46:38.879
Barry! Stories come, stories go.

46:38.962 --> 46:41.465
Chick is a nut job
looking for a pound of flesh.

46:41.548 --> 46:45.093
That's some Hannibal Lecter,
lambs-are-screaming shit.

46:45.177 --> 46:47.095
What our woke friend means to say

46:47.179 --> 46:50.390
is that the young woman may be
suffering some mental health issues.

46:50.474 --> 46:53.811
All I have is what she said on background.
I can't do the story with that.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.896
So what do I do? I'm not giving up.

46:55.979 --> 47:00.901
I'm not going in there and telling
Paul that he wins, I'll do #MeToo.

47:00.984 --> 47:05.656
So what? I go back there and convince her
to say yes to giving me the interview.

47:10.118 --> 47:11.453
What?

47:12.120 --> 47:13.247
That's not enough.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.333
It's not just that she needs
to give you the interview.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.586
I didn't say this, I never said this!

47:20.170 --> 47:22.673
But she needs to not take the deal.

47:22.756 --> 47:25.133
Don't you say that to her.
That is unethical.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.971
But he's right, you need the time.

47:29.054 --> 47:31.223
You need to interview her
over and over again.

47:31.306 --> 47:33.350
You need to build a story,
talk to sources.

47:33.433 --> 47:35.978
Come back to her again.
You need time with her.

47:36.061 --> 47:37.604
But she takes the deal, she's gone.

47:37.688 --> 47:40.607
Both of you… Viv, you're…

47:42.067 --> 47:43.110
Yeah.

47:43.193 --> 47:44.987
Obviously, she can't take the deal.

47:45.070 --> 47:47.573
You need the trial. No trial, no story.

47:47.656 --> 47:48.782
What are you talking about?

47:48.866 --> 47:51.201
I still have time with her
if she takes the deal.

47:51.285 --> 47:52.703
If she takes a deal, she's what?

47:52.786 --> 47:54.913
Immediately sent Upstate
to serve her time?

47:54.997 --> 47:58.166
You're not going to be able
to drive two, three, four hours

47:58.250 --> 48:00.168
to and from some prison
every week to see her.

48:00.794 --> 48:02.629
I can do that. Why can't I do that?

48:05.716 --> 48:08.468
I know we all pretend
like it's not happening,

48:08.552 --> 48:11.388
but you do actually understand
that a baby's going to come

48:11.471 --> 48:14.182
shooting out
of your hoochie pretty soon, right?

48:22.441 --> 48:25.235
-Oh, fuck.
-Hey.

48:26.570 --> 48:30.240
Maybe you'll get lucky.
Maybe she won't take the deal.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.159
She's taking the deal.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.829
-Okay.
-Yeah.

48:36.496 --> 48:38.290
McCaw offered,
and it's a pretty good deal.

48:40.083 --> 48:40.918
Okay.

48:42.544 --> 48:43.378
Okay.

48:43.462 --> 48:44.713
Anna has asked me to tell you

48:44.796 --> 48:47.007
that she's not interested
in doing the interview.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.133
Obviously.

48:48.675 --> 48:52.012
She just didn't like
the direction you were headed.

48:53.430 --> 48:54.473
The direction?

48:55.766 --> 48:57.434
The direction?

48:57.517 --> 49:00.729
Oh, Todd. Can I call you Todd?
I'm gonna call you Todd.

49:00.812 --> 49:02.814
-Sure.
-Your client is out of her fucking mind.

49:02.898 --> 49:05.567
There was no direction.
My direction was nowhere.

49:05.651 --> 49:08.946
I have no idea who Anna Delvey,
Anna Sorokin, whoever, is.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.781
The more I know, the less I know.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.707
Heartbeat is strong.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.585
So, uh, what is it?

49:24.336 --> 49:25.379
Can't tell yet.

49:26.588 --> 49:28.966
This kid of yours
doesn't want to turn around for me.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.259
Vivian.

49:32.719 --> 49:33.804
Right there.

49:34.930 --> 49:35.889
It's a girl.

49:37.015 --> 49:39.935
Yes! It's a girl. Vivian!

49:42.229 --> 49:43.397
Vivian?

49:43.480 --> 49:45.899
Fuck, fucking, fuck, fuck.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.651
Fuckety fucking fuck.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.861
Fuckety fucking fuck fuckers.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.115
-I'm gonna be back in a minute.
-Yeah.

49:53.198 --> 49:54.491
Yep.

49:56.368 --> 49:57.411
-Hmm.

49:57.494 --> 50:02.749
Um, Vivian, I am trying to think
of something comforting to say to you.

50:04.042 --> 50:07.838
-Uh, because I can sense you're upset.

50:07.921 --> 50:09.131
But I don't want to

50:09.214 --> 50:13.802
because you are ruining
one of the best moments of my life.

50:14.970 --> 50:15.887
Start explaining.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.181
She's real.

50:21.059 --> 50:24.771
I thought I was going to
have it fixed, my reputation…

50:25.605 --> 50:26.940
before there was a tiny person

50:27.024 --> 50:29.860
I'm required to keep alive
and pay attention to.

50:31.611 --> 50:34.281
I want her, I do.
It's…

50:34.948 --> 50:37.451
I thought I would have my career saved.

50:39.202 --> 50:42.539
I thought it would be repaired,
breathing, on its feet,

50:42.622 --> 50:45.083
before who I get to be changes.

50:47.502 --> 50:49.337
Look. She's real.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.301
I've run out of time.

50:54.384 --> 50:57.095
And if you tell me
my joy at having a daughter

50:57.179 --> 50:59.556
is supposed to make up
for the loss of my career,

50:59.639 --> 51:01.725
the loss of the thing
that lights up my brain,

51:01.808 --> 51:05.687
I swear to God,
I will smother you in your sleep.

51:20.452 --> 51:21.453
Thank you.

51:22.412 --> 51:24.247
You never have to thank me.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.668
I am happy that it's a girl.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.337
I know.

51:34.591 --> 51:35.842
What do you want to do?

53:39.007 --> 53:40.508
Wait up by the loading dock.

53:49.851 --> 53:50.852
Going on break.

53:51.728 --> 53:55.982
Hell no, you cannot deny me a break.
Union. Do I need to say it twice?

53:56.608 --> 53:57.525
Okay then.

54:05.575 --> 54:07.786
How did you and Anna become friends?

54:07.869 --> 54:10.622
I work here,
Anna lived here for months.

54:11.289 --> 54:12.749
We just clicked.

54:12.832 --> 54:14.542
Why'd you lie about knowing her?

54:14.626 --> 54:16.670
I did not lie. I just did not share.

54:16.753 --> 54:19.506
-Would you mind if I interviewed you?
-No. Thank you.

54:19.589 --> 54:20.674
Can I ask why?

54:22.175 --> 54:23.385
I don't sell out my friends.

54:28.181 --> 54:31.268
There's a bunch of photos of you
and Anna and these two women.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.937
You were all good friends. What happened?

54:36.815 --> 54:37.691
Goodbye.

54:39.109 --> 54:40.902
Anna's taking a plea. Did you know?

54:45.198 --> 54:47.033
Anna's not dumb. If she's taken a plea

54:47.117 --> 54:49.661
it's because she's decided
that's the right thing to do.

54:49.744 --> 54:51.204
Is that why you're here?

54:51.288 --> 54:53.123
To see if I knew about Anna?

54:54.374 --> 54:57.043
I guess I just don't want to see
Anna throw her life away.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.338
You don't care about Anna.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.882
You care about your story,
and I don't know why,

55:02.966 --> 55:06.219
but obviously if Anna takes a plea
you somehow don't get your story.

55:06.303 --> 55:10.473
So the answer to my question
"Why are you here?" is me.

55:11.433 --> 55:14.602
You came here hoping I would go
convince Anna not to take a plea

55:14.686 --> 55:16.521
so you can have your story, right?

55:16.604 --> 55:18.356
Neff, listen.

55:19.649 --> 55:25.822
This could be an important story
about financial institutions,

55:25.905 --> 55:27.866
the way women are treated,

55:27.949 --> 55:31.119
and how society admits
only those elite few--

55:31.202 --> 55:34.539
Whatever. I am not new. I am not stupid.

55:34.622 --> 55:39.461
This is New York.
I work in the New York people business.

55:40.211 --> 55:43.757
Everyone here is running a game.
Everyone here needs to score.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.258
Everyone here is hustling.

55:45.342 --> 55:48.261
Everyone here wants something.

55:48.345 --> 55:52.474
Money, power, image, love.

55:53.558 --> 55:55.810
You want something.
You want to take from Anna.

55:56.936 --> 55:59.814
Be bold enough to admit that.
That, I could maybe respect.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.817
This, you showing up
with a latte and a smile,

56:02.901 --> 56:07.864
hoping I'll help you
because you care about women and society?

56:08.406 --> 56:11.159
No. Not today, Satan.

56:11.826 --> 56:13.578
I need this interview.

56:14.245 --> 56:15.372
I want…

56:17.832 --> 56:21.127
I want the career I was supposed to have.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.173
I don't need you to convince Anna.

56:25.757 --> 56:28.843
If she's going to respect me,
I'm pretty sure I have to do that myself.

56:28.927 --> 56:33.807
But I need to know, what does Anna want?

56:56.246 --> 57:00.625
Vivian? I'm Beth,
the Rikers media liaison.

57:00.708 --> 57:01.626
Get in.

57:20.061 --> 57:21.062
Sit down.

57:23.022 --> 57:24.107
Have some tea.

57:30.029 --> 57:31.406
You're wondering why I'm here.

57:32.866 --> 57:34.576
I'm not doing the interview.

57:34.659 --> 57:35.785
I'm taking the deal.

57:37.036 --> 57:38.079
Todd told you.

57:39.247 --> 57:40.165
He did.

57:41.499 --> 57:45.545
But I just can't stop thinking, why?

57:47.505 --> 57:50.216
If I go to trial and lose,

57:50.300 --> 57:55.847
Todd says that I could go to prison
for at least 15 years, maybe more.

57:55.930 --> 57:59.851
And if I take the deal,
I'm out in four and they deport me.

57:59.934 --> 58:01.978
Why wouldn't I take the deal?

58:03.021 --> 58:05.732
It's just this whole thing.

58:07.525 --> 58:13.198
Everyone's calling you
a scam artist, a dumb socialite, a joke.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.909
They're all deciding who you are.

58:15.992 --> 58:20.747
When you take the deal,
that's it, you're agreeing with them.

58:21.414 --> 58:23.625
You'll be a dumb socialite forever.

58:23.708 --> 58:29.839
The trial and everything leading up to it
is your one chance to defend yourself,

58:29.923 --> 58:31.966
to restore your reputation.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.594
I'm surprised you'd give that up.

58:36.721 --> 58:39.140
Oh. What? So, now you care about me?

58:39.224 --> 58:41.768
No, I'm not your friend.

58:41.851 --> 58:45.522
You don't need to like me,
I'm a journalist.

58:45.605 --> 58:47.690
I want something from you.

58:48.274 --> 58:50.109
I want this story.

58:51.444 --> 58:54.322
In return, I can give you what you want.

58:55.698 --> 58:57.450
And what do you think I want?

59:01.287 --> 59:03.540
I understand we have a plea agreement.

59:03.623 --> 59:06.668
We do, Your Honor.
Defendant pleads guilty to all counts.

59:06.751 --> 59:09.003
Four years conditional parole,
with deportation.

59:09.087 --> 59:11.089
The defense
has advised the defendant?

59:11.172 --> 59:12.006
Yes, Your Honor.

59:12.090 --> 59:14.842
And the defendant
understands the details of the plea?

59:14.926 --> 59:17.011
-She does.
-And she agrees?

59:17.095 --> 59:19.305
-She does.
-No.

59:20.890 --> 59:22.016
Anna.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.601
What?

59:24.644 --> 59:28.147
They will not call
Anna Delvey a dumb socialite.

59:28.231 --> 59:30.400
I'm smart. I'm a businesswoman.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.026
We do this.

59:33.486 --> 59:34.404
Okay?

59:36.197 --> 59:37.115
Okay.

59:39.242 --> 59:42.870
My client wishes
to reject the plea offer, Your Honor.

59:42.954 --> 59:44.789
I want to be heard in court.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.749
I want a trial.

59:47.959 --> 59:51.254
She wants a trial,
so we're going to trial.

1:00:10.231 --> 1:00:13.276
In return, I can give you what you want.

1:00:15.194 --> 1:00:16.863
And what do you think I want?

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:20.033
To be rescued? To be found innocent?

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:22.452
No. You want to be famous.

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:27.123
If you let me,
I will tell the world your story

1:00:27.206 --> 1:00:29.042
and I will write the hell out of it.

1:00:30.126 --> 1:00:31.294
I will make you famous.

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:36.132
<i>Everyone will know the name Anna Delvey.</i>

1:01:04.952 --> 1:01:06.579
That bitch didn't take a plea.

1:01:07.914 --> 1:01:09.374
There's going to be a trial.

1:01:16.130 --> 1:01:18.800
A reporter tried to talk to me.
Did you talk to her?

1:01:18.883 --> 1:01:22.011
No, no. I absolutely refused.

1:01:23.346 --> 1:01:24.263
Oh, me too.
