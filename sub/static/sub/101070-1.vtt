WEBVTT

01:48.316 --> 01:50.783
Okay, so do you feel
that your band

01:50.785 --> 01:52.852
formed part of what some people
call the...

01:52.854 --> 01:55.855
Your band? Excuse me?

01:55.857 --> 01:57.490
- The band.
- The band.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.858
Sorry.

01:58.860 --> 02:02.195
Paul, my question is for you.

02:02.197 --> 02:04.330
Do you feel that the band,
The Fantomes,

02:04.332 --> 02:07.533
formed part of what some people
call the Post Punk movement

02:07.535 --> 02:10.238
or did you guys
just come out of nowhere?

02:11.706 --> 02:13.274
Paul?

02:14.209 --> 02:16.776
Well, what about you?

02:16.778 --> 02:20.713
- I don't have an opinion.
- Really?

02:20.715 --> 02:23.216
So you don't have an opinion
about the allegations

02:23.218 --> 02:26.888
of girls who've said that
you've attacked them?

02:28.856 --> 02:30.558
That's just noise.

02:31.926 --> 02:34.760
- Just noise?
- Just noise.

02:34.762 --> 02:36.831
Then there's no truth
in that noise?

02:39.500 --> 02:41.267
Ah, gosh!!

02:41.269 --> 02:43.569
Because there've been some very
serious allegations!!

02:43.571 --> 02:45.573
Okay, that's it.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.383
Can I ask you a quick question?

02:57.385 --> 02:58.751
Yeah.

02:58.753 --> 03:00.486
So, why did you decide
to go on the road?

03:00.488 --> 03:02.255
Oh, no, I'm not,
I'm not with the group.

03:02.257 --> 03:03.789
No, I know, I know, I know,
I know, but I just wanted

03:03.791 --> 03:05.925
to know a little bit about you
and your world

03:05.927 --> 03:08.630
and your passions and interests.

03:17.905 --> 03:20.673
Why do I have to go anywhere?

03:41.329 --> 03:43.031
Wow, you made this?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.600
Ah, shit,
some girl gave that to me

03:47.602 --> 03:49.935
to give to them
and then they canceled the show.

03:49.937 --> 03:51.804
She's gonna kill me,
I... I don't know how many hours

03:51.806 --> 03:53.675
she spent on that thing.

03:55.543 --> 03:58.678
You know, I know somebody
that tours with them.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.414
I can give it to 'em.

04:01.416 --> 04:04.083
With The Fantomes?

04:04.085 --> 04:08.087
I don't know,
I mean, it might be valuable.

04:08.089 --> 04:10.656
I... I was thinking
of just framing it.

04:10.658 --> 04:12.460
Waiting.

05:13.955 --> 05:16.090
How long have you been here?

05:17.792 --> 05:20.128
Okay, stay here.
Okay, okay.

05:50.992 --> 05:52.860
Who are you?

05:54.061 --> 05:55.563
Viena.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.800
That's not your real name
though.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.471
She know the rules?

06:06.441 --> 06:08.009
What's this?

06:08.776 --> 06:10.776
Just a drawing

06:10.778 --> 06:13.979
- Fuck! Did you do this?
- Yeah.

06:13.981 --> 06:15.948
Back in he day.

06:15.950 --> 06:18.085
'Cause you're special, right?

06:21.989 --> 06:23.758
You guys just keep multiplying.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.896
Did you do this? What is this?

06:50.818 --> 06:53.719
So this goes to Freddy
and those go to Albert.

06:53.721 --> 06:55.254
Albert who sleeps
with...

06:55.256 --> 06:57.990
Madge. And Madge
is the boss around here.

06:57.992 --> 06:59.925
So don't fuck with her.

07:12.874 --> 07:15.274
Hey, help me out
with this.

07:15.276 --> 07:16.777
Yeah, of course.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.617
- And you are?
- Her name is Viena.

07:24.619 --> 07:26.153
She's helping us out.

07:33.761 --> 07:36.529
- Hey.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:36.531 --> 07:37.997
You have to return those.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.901
Boyer and his friends
are staying on the trucks.

07:41.903 --> 07:43.936
Madge, can you come and check
this out?

07:43.938 --> 07:46.641
- Yeah one second, baby.
- Now!

08:01.155 --> 08:03.289
Almost no one got a room.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.958
So the leeches are gonna be
with us tonight, probably.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.061
- Who're the leeches?
- Hey, hey, you. Right there!

08:09.063 --> 08:13.132
Put that bag back inside,
right now. Who are you?

08:13.134 --> 08:14.733
They told me to bring it down,
I'm sorry.

08:14.735 --> 08:16.804
Yeah?
Who the fuck told you that?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.942
How do you do it?

08:56.944 --> 08:59.046
How do you survive this place?

09:00.247 --> 09:02.748
Uh... it's easy.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.284
You just... just pretend
to be busy,

09:05.286 --> 09:08.723
try not to say no,
stay out of everyone's way.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.626
There's always a dog
that everybody walks all over.

09:13.628 --> 09:15.794
Don't be that.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.932
And don't clean toilets.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.141
Light here.

10:04.912 --> 10:06.812
I wrote your favorite...

10:10.084 --> 10:11.952
No, wait, wait, wait.

10:20.294 --> 10:22.728
- You're fuckin' it up now.
- Don't...

10:22.730 --> 10:25.831
- Please, don't do that.
- Oh, my God, calm down.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.200
She's definitely not
a cover though.

10:28.202 --> 10:30.703
- You tried.
- Yo, what's your name?

10:30.705 --> 10:33.172
- Viena.
- Can we have it?

10:33.174 --> 10:34.973
What's the point now?

10:34.975 --> 10:39.044
- Oh, my God, please stop.
- You'll make another one.

10:39.046 --> 10:40.915
I mean, it's all fucked up.

10:43.350 --> 10:47.152
Oh, don't be so dramatic,
it's not fucking tragedy.

10:47.154 --> 10:49.757
- Susi.
- Hey, that was good.

10:57.798 --> 10:59.231
Hey, don't take it like that.

10:59.233 --> 11:02.970
She's, uh, she's just like that
sometimes.

11:08.409 --> 11:09.944
Viena...

11:12.880 --> 11:14.982
What's your favorite song?

11:16.016 --> 11:18.085
"Two Black Dots."

11:19.520 --> 11:21.286
Okay.

11:21.288 --> 11:24.189
You make us another drawing

11:24.191 --> 11:26.761
and I'll play that song
tomorrow for you.

11:28.863 --> 11:30.765
How'd you like that?

11:34.301 --> 11:36.003
Cheer up.

11:54.522 --> 11:56.555
Anyway, so it's like the middle
of the concert

11:56.557 --> 11:58.957
and Albert, like, jumps up
and starts hanging

11:58.959 --> 12:00.826
from the speaker that's above
him, and the speaker

12:00.828 --> 12:02.861
just like breaks,
like, something snaps

12:02.863 --> 12:05.063
and he gets electrocuted
and like falls to the ground

12:05.065 --> 12:08.000
and we're, like, holy shit,
like, he's dead.

12:08.002 --> 12:09.935
Like, it's over. He's dead.

12:16.811 --> 12:19.244
Hey, what's your name?

12:19.246 --> 12:22.314
- Uh, Vivian.
- Vivian? Cool.

12:22.316 --> 12:24.316
- You with them?
- What?

12:24.318 --> 12:26.985
- You with the band too, right?
- Uh, yeah.

12:26.987 --> 12:30.055
- Great parties and all, right?
- Yeah.

12:30.057 --> 12:32.591
- How do you get accepted?
- What?

12:32.593 --> 12:35.594
- How do you get in?
- Oh, y... you're invited.

12:35.596 --> 12:38.564
- And who do you know?
- Oh, uh, I gotta go.

12:38.566 --> 12:40.935
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

13:29.116 --> 13:30.451
What?

13:37.157 --> 13:40.094
It's fine, it's fine.
It's fine, come on.

13:47.434 --> 13:49.303
Uh, this place
is a mess.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.648
Hey!

14:02.650 --> 14:05.284
Hey, um, so...

14:05.286 --> 14:07.519
Uh, Susi, um...

14:07.521 --> 14:11.156
she brought us, uh,
some of these beers.

14:11.158 --> 14:13.027
If you want one...

14:14.261 --> 14:16.528
What, y... you don't like
to have fun?

14:16.530 --> 14:18.664
- Not your kinda fun.
- Yeah, I'm not talkin' to you.

14:18.666 --> 14:20.399
You were so rude to me
the other day and now you wanna

14:20.401 --> 14:23.435
come in here
and offer me a drink?

14:23.437 --> 14:26.638
Um, hey, why don't you,
like, take a sip of this.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.476
No, I'm not gonna drink
from your shitty little flask.

14:34.014 --> 14:35.580
Okay, alright.

14:35.582 --> 14:37.282
Alright, so why don't we like
quit with this bullshit

14:37.284 --> 14:38.684
and why don't you just fucking
take a sip.

14:38.686 --> 14:40.252
- And stop being a bitch.
- I don't want to.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.586
Yeah, why don't you just fuckin'
take one sip.

14:41.588 --> 14:43.655
- Hey, stop! Stop it!
- Dude!

14:43.657 --> 14:46.091
Come on, why don't you just
leave? You're being a creep.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.292
Boyer, come on,
get the fuck out!

14:47.294 --> 14:49.695
- Bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up!
- Dude!

14:49.697 --> 14:53.332
- Back the fuck off.
- Get out.

14:53.334 --> 14:55.100
Get out! You're being
a fuckin' asshole!

14:55.102 --> 14:56.603
Get out!

14:59.073 --> 15:01.442
Fucking hate that guy!

15:09.083 --> 15:12.317
- Oh-ho! Dude! No way.
- What?

15:12.319 --> 15:15.153
- It's her tape!
- Oh, my God!

15:15.155 --> 15:16.688
What is it?

15:16.690 --> 15:18.223
This crazy bitch
that almost put

15:18.225 --> 15:19.591
Freddy and Albert in jail.

15:19.593 --> 15:21.426
She's like 16
and they were drunk

15:21.428 --> 15:24.429
and she said that they tried
to drown her in a Jacuzzi.

15:24.431 --> 15:26.698
Then there were like cops
hanging around for a while

15:26.700 --> 15:32.070
and then one day randomly
she just dropped the charges.

15:32.072 --> 15:34.606
Freddy,
I made this tape for you.

15:34.608 --> 15:37.309
You found me, insult me
with your purity

15:37.311 --> 15:41.513
and now I realize you never
wanted to kill me.

15:41.515 --> 15:43.215
You wanted to save me.

15:43.217 --> 15:47.285
So tonight, I'm going to finish
what you started...

15:47.287 --> 15:49.721
to this song.

15:49.723 --> 15:51.590
My favorite song.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.195
Hi.

17:08.469 --> 17:10.135
Yo, where's the kid?

17:10.137 --> 17:11.736
Come on, come on, we need you.

17:11.738 --> 17:13.371
- What for?
- Boyer picked a fight.

17:13.373 --> 17:15.540
We gotta go get his back,
come on, man.

17:15.541 --> 17:17.644
Come on, go!

17:34.761 --> 17:37.729
Boyer, you fucking retard?
How did you let this happen?

17:37.731 --> 17:40.465
This ain't my fault, okay?
He wanted to fight!

17:40.467 --> 17:43.535
Hey, you!
You fuckin' wanna fight?

17:43.537 --> 17:45.370
Answer me.
You wanted to fight?

17:45.372 --> 17:47.139
It's not his fault.

17:55.883 --> 17:58.152
Hey, Keyes, you alright?

18:00.888 --> 18:04.892
Honestly, I don't know what
the fuss is about. I spit blood.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.267
Mother fucker,
did I tell you to do that?

18:15.269 --> 18:17.602
Did I tell you to do that?
Don't fuck with me right now.

18:17.604 --> 18:19.738
Did I tell you to fuckin'
do that?

18:30.851 --> 18:34.953
Are you okay?
Thank you.

18:34.955 --> 18:36.555
Okay, he said he didn't tell him
to fight.

18:36.557 --> 18:38.190
- So, let's just...
- Hey, did I say shit?

18:38.192 --> 18:39.591
- Did I say anything?
- Come on, come on.

18:39.593 --> 18:40.725
- Did I say anything?
- Come on.

18:40.727 --> 18:41.826
Please leave.

18:41.828 --> 18:43.530
This is not what we do.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.570
You see...

18:51.572 --> 18:53.538
it's just a little...

18:53.540 --> 18:55.409
Looks good.

18:58.445 --> 19:00.714
- Who told you though?
- Okay, let's go out.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.851
Ice it, disinfect the wound.

19:06.853 --> 19:09.323
Then I'm buying both of you
a drink.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.763
Well, at least
I got us invited.

19:17.598 --> 19:19.466
Shut the fuck up!

19:21.501 --> 19:23.301
We'll go in the back.

19:23.303 --> 19:25.606
About fuckin' time.

19:26.773 --> 19:28.642
Come on, hurry up.

19:29.243 --> 19:30.644
Goddamn!

20:37.978 --> 20:40.045
How much money
did we spend tonight?

20:40.047 --> 20:41.748
Let go, Al.

21:16.016 --> 21:17.782
What... what if
they come outside.

21:17.784 --> 21:19.653
There's nobody here.

21:22.456 --> 21:23.757
Hey!

21:34.668 --> 21:36.735
- No! No! No!
- No?

21:36.737 --> 21:39.003
- No, no, no,
- No, no, no.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.635
Hey!

22:10.637 --> 22:13.772
Get the fuck out of my pool!

22:13.774 --> 22:15.776
I'm callin' the police.

23:15.836 --> 23:18.038
Albert's gonna do it.

23:19.639 --> 23:21.840
I'm not doing it.

23:21.842 --> 23:24.611
They came all the way
from Norway, just a minute.

24:25.739 --> 24:27.005
Can I get some privacy in here?

24:27.007 --> 24:29.807
I have to go.

24:29.809 --> 24:33.545
Go away, Viena.
You're ruining my shower.

24:33.547 --> 24:35.680
I can't have a moments peace.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.215
- Go away.
- Stop!

24:37.217 --> 24:39.050
- Get out!
- What?

24:39.052 --> 24:41.152
- Now, you're gonna get wet.
- Stop it.

24:41.154 --> 24:43.588
- Please go, Viena.
- No!

24:43.590 --> 24:46.326
- No! Stop it!
- Go away!

24:57.270 --> 24:59.239
Viena.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.246
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:08.248 --> 25:10.114
What're you doin'?

25:10.116 --> 25:12.350
Just doin' some numbers
for Madge.

25:12.352 --> 25:15.119
Oh, yeah?

25:15.121 --> 25:18.358
At what point are you gonna
clean the grill?

25:20.226 --> 25:21.960
I said I would get someone
to clean the grill

25:21.962 --> 25:24.598
I'm not doing it right now,
I'm busy with this.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.301
Everyone has to do more
than one job, you know.

25:30.303 --> 25:32.337
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what?

25:32.339 --> 25:34.038
Yeah, I know.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.776
I do more than a hundred jobs,
Susi.

25:41.881 --> 25:44.115
Okay, you know what,
when you finish

25:44.117 --> 25:47.018
I need you to clean this mess
and that bathroom.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.355
Sorry?

25:49.990 --> 25:53.825
I'm telling you that when you're
done with your job

25:53.827 --> 25:55.929
to clean the bathroom.

25:57.263 --> 25:59.163
- I can't do that.
- Really?

25:59.165 --> 26:00.198
It's not gonna happen.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.100
So you're basically telling me

26:02.102 --> 26:03.334
to go fuck myself?

26:03.336 --> 26:05.169
I'm not saying that,
I'm just saying

26:05.171 --> 26:06.938
I'm not gonna clean
the bathroom. It's not my job.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.342
Your job is to do
what you're told.

26:28.395 --> 26:31.197
Alright, it's done.
Get out, you're fired.

26:32.032 --> 26:33.366
Get out!

26:37.437 --> 26:40.140
I'm serious I just talked to the
boys. You have an hour to leave.

26:41.408 --> 26:43.910
You want to be a fuckin' badass,
right?

26:55.989 --> 26:58.956
Hey! What're you doing?

26:58.958 --> 27:02.126
- She fired me.
- Wha... Who? Susi?

27:02.128 --> 27:03.428
Wait, wait,
no, no, no, no, no.

27:03.430 --> 27:04.929
She doesn't have the power
to fire you.

27:04.931 --> 27:06.764
We should go talk
to the boys about this.

27:06.766 --> 27:07.832
Will you talk to me, please?
Where the fuck are you...

27:07.834 --> 27:09.200
Hey, listen, can you just clean

27:09.202 --> 27:10.968
the fucking bathroom?

27:10.970 --> 27:14.839
Viena, wait, you can't just not
talk to me about this.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.941
V, where the fuck
are you gonna go?

27:16.943 --> 27:20.078
- Hey, where you goin'?
- Away.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.280
- Why?
- I'm fired.

27:22.282 --> 27:25.116
- How?
- It was me.

27:25.118 --> 27:27.852
She has to go, all she wants
to do is have fun and not work

27:27.854 --> 27:29.487
and we can't afford
to have people like that.

27:29.489 --> 27:30.922
It's bullshit!

27:30.924 --> 27:33.091
A lot of people here
want you out.

27:33.093 --> 27:36.260
Okay? We work, we work hard.
That's what we do.

27:36.262 --> 27:38.296
Okay.

27:38.298 --> 27:40.300
Hey, Viena, stop.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.767
Just stop.

27:42.769 --> 27:44.437
Can I talk to you?

27:47.107 --> 27:49.075
You wanna drop the bag?

27:53.113 --> 27:55.079
Keyes, just take the bags back
to the room?

27:55.081 --> 27:56.816
Don't you fucking dare!

28:02.489 --> 28:04.357
Susi.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.107
God-fucking-dammit,
Freddy!

28:23.109 --> 28:24.475
- Is this what you want?
- Oh!

28:24.477 --> 28:26.310
The toasters going
to the highway.

28:26.312 --> 28:28.813
You fucker, Freddy!

28:28.815 --> 28:32.283
- This is the end.
- Is this what you want?

28:32.285 --> 28:34.318
I just don't know what's fucking
keeping me here.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.954
I really know you're pushing me
out the fucking door!

28:36.956 --> 28:39.959
Do you want me to leave?
Is this what you want?

28:42.061 --> 28:44.462
I've done everything
you've ever asked me to do!

28:44.464 --> 28:48.166
What haven't I done for you?
God damn it, Freddy!

28:49.869 --> 28:51.469
Is...

28:51.471 --> 28:54.941
- Is he coming over here?
- Oh, fuck. Shit.

29:00.079 --> 29:01.381
Hey.

29:03.183 --> 29:06.352
Now, you better lock your doors,
tonight the devil is out.

29:08.555 --> 29:10.089
You got any beer?

29:11.591 --> 29:13.126
Yeah.

29:21.067 --> 29:22.836
Thanks.

30:50.556 --> 30:52.590
Why am I not pissed off?

30:52.592 --> 30:55.395
- When am I not pissed?
- Mm-hm.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.299
Hey, come on, not here.

31:01.301 --> 31:02.566
You got all these places
to ride,

31:02.568 --> 31:04.535
can you ride somewhere else,
please?

31:04.537 --> 31:06.306
God damn!

31:26.993 --> 31:29.260
She's here,
she's just standing there...

31:29.262 --> 31:31.564
Fuck it, I said
I don't wanna do it, Madge.

31:34.367 --> 31:37.170
- Um, do you want one of these?
- Not now, Viena.

31:39.505 --> 31:42.506
- What do you have?
- Turkey sandwiches.

31:49.349 --> 31:51.217
Are you okay?

31:52.552 --> 31:55.621
No, I'm not, I feel terrible.

32:00.426 --> 32:02.526
I'm sorry.

32:02.528 --> 32:04.528
It's okay, alright?

32:04.530 --> 32:07.367
It's not your fault.
It's not all about you.

32:29.255 --> 32:32.656
Are you kidding me?
That's pretty good.

32:32.658 --> 32:35.526
- Alright.
- Hey.

32:35.528 --> 32:39.230
You guys, um... doing
well?

32:39.232 --> 32:42.700
- Good day?
- Yep.

32:42.702 --> 32:47.171
Can, uh, can you leave
us alone for a second please?

32:47.173 --> 32:49.540
- Two minutes.
- Sure.

32:49.542 --> 32:51.644
Thank you.

33:05.124 --> 33:07.126
Do you know what you're doing?

33:08.261 --> 33:09.493
What?

33:09.495 --> 33:12.131
You want him. Right?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.499
What?

33:15.501 --> 33:18.202
You want him.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.571
There's nothing wrong with him.

33:20.573 --> 33:24.141
But that what's happening.

33:24.143 --> 33:28.179
I... I don't think you should
get mixed with him.

33:28.181 --> 33:31.315
I... I don't want you to get
mixed up with Freddy.

33:31.317 --> 33:34.218
I know you think it's a good
idea, but it's not.

33:34.220 --> 33:38.091
I mean, I don't think you can
help him or us.

33:39.425 --> 33:41.425
Do you understand?

35:10.917 --> 35:14.618
Oh, fuck. Hey, move away
from the amp.

35:14.620 --> 35:16.522
Over there.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.976
Freddy!

36:11.978 --> 36:13.946
He's in the bathroom.

36:25.424 --> 36:28.459
Hell no. No, no, no, no, no.
Get out.

36:28.461 --> 36:30.027
- I'm not doing anything.
- Get out.

36:30.029 --> 36:31.862
I'm not doing anything.
It's you.

36:31.864 --> 36:33.964
- Go on, go, go, go.
- It's you.

36:33.966 --> 36:35.534
It's all you...

36:51.751 --> 36:53.753
So why, Viena?

36:55.354 --> 36:57.456
Some of my friends
call me Viena.

36:59.458 --> 37:02.061
But it's not my name.
My name is Julia.

37:04.563 --> 37:06.430
You know we are almost broke,
right, Julia?

37:06.432 --> 37:09.669
Don't call me that... please.

37:12.038 --> 37:14.940
But, yeah, I heard some Monroe
guy has all your money.

37:17.343 --> 37:19.777
You know the money people say,
you can't play

37:19.779 --> 37:23.349
without any money,
but who needs money to play?

38:05.858 --> 38:08.392
I'm sorry.

38:08.394 --> 38:10.062
I know.

38:25.378 --> 38:27.646
Ah, we're gonna
fuck up that kid.

39:47.793 --> 39:49.128
Paul?

39:50.963 --> 39:53.664
Well, what about you?

39:53.666 --> 39:56.099
I don't have an opinion.

39:56.101 --> 39:57.835
Really?

39:57.837 --> 40:00.037
You don't have opinion
about the allegations

40:00.039 --> 40:03.843
of girls who've said
that you've attacked them.

40:59.565 --> 41:00.599
What is that?

41:05.170 --> 41:07.773
- You've got to end it with him.
- What?

41:09.275 --> 41:11.808
You've got to end it with him.

41:11.810 --> 41:13.012
Who?

41:14.713 --> 41:15.915
Your guy.

41:18.651 --> 41:22.252
What guy? Keyes?

41:22.254 --> 41:25.055
Yeah, that guy.

41:25.057 --> 41:27.090
He's not my guy.

41:27.092 --> 41:30.861
I mean I like him,
but he's not my guy.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.865
Well, I think
you gotta stop that.

41:36.302 --> 41:38.671
I don't even really talk to him.

41:42.608 --> 41:43.642
You see...

41:45.711 --> 41:47.179
if we do this...

41:48.113 --> 41:49.315
we should do it.

41:50.316 --> 41:51.717
Okay?

41:53.152 --> 41:54.620
The right way.

41:57.756 --> 41:58.958
End it, please.

42:01.660 --> 42:02.928
You're serious?

42:05.898 --> 42:07.066
Okay.

42:16.709 --> 42:18.976
Hey. Can I talk to Keyes
for two seconds?

42:18.978 --> 42:21.912
Why? I mean it's about to be
my turn it just...

42:21.914 --> 42:24.948
- I mean you can just say it.
- Just two seconds.

42:24.950 --> 42:27.620
- Okay, fine. Can you pause it?
- There's no pause, man.

42:28.654 --> 42:30.956
Sorry, no pause. Gotta wait.

42:32.124 --> 42:34.091
Come on.

42:34.093 --> 42:37.363
Viena just turned your victory
to shit, so none of this counts.

42:42.635 --> 42:45.369
I'm about to beat myself...

42:45.371 --> 42:47.239
and my own record.

42:52.811 --> 42:53.846
Um...

42:57.950 --> 43:01.420
I just wanted to say that
I'm, I'm with Freddy now.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.792
Okay.

43:40.392 --> 43:41.427
It's done.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.196
And?

43:45.731 --> 43:46.865
And what?

43:47.766 --> 43:48.801
Well, what did he say?

43:51.837 --> 43:53.937
He didn't say anything.

43:53.939 --> 43:55.441
He said it was okay.

43:57.376 --> 43:58.410
What?

44:00.212 --> 44:02.481
That's what he said.
He said, "Okay."

44:03.749 --> 44:05.050
Just like that?

44:08.887 --> 44:09.922
Fuck.

44:12.324 --> 44:16.326
That... that's fucking worse than
weird and...

44:16.328 --> 44:19.331
- Why is that weird?
- Can you just go, please?

44:22.134 --> 44:24.801
You know, just to me
"Okay" is bullshit.

44:24.803 --> 44:27.237
Like suppose, you know, this was
me and there was this guy

44:27.239 --> 44:28.739
and he just says, he says

44:28.741 --> 44:29.973
there's this girl
you like man, right.

44:29.975 --> 44:31.508
This... this fucking skank.

44:31.510 --> 44:33.143
She getting passed around.

44:33.145 --> 44:35.414
You know, I can only take that
one fucking way!

44:52.865 --> 44:54.199
Hey, Keyes, man.

45:00.005 --> 45:01.840
Yo, can you open
the equipment box?

45:37.409 --> 45:38.443
In the back.

45:55.427 --> 45:56.927
That's it?

45:56.929 --> 45:59.131
Uh, yeah.

46:02.067 --> 46:03.202
Alright.

46:27.226 --> 46:29.092
Do you want this anywhere?

46:29.094 --> 46:30.262
Anywhere is fine.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.869
- This one?
- Anywhere.

46:38.871 --> 46:40.205
- Here?
- Sure.

46:45.644 --> 46:47.045
How are you?

46:52.484 --> 46:54.019
Don't patronize me.

46:56.355 --> 46:57.389
Okay.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.229
How are you?

47:05.230 --> 47:06.265
Fine.

47:11.503 --> 47:13.236
How's the sex?

47:13.238 --> 47:15.005
What?

47:15.007 --> 47:16.308
How's the sex?

47:24.082 --> 47:27.150
Viena,
how's the sex?

47:27.152 --> 47:29.655
- It's good.
- It sounded good.

47:52.477 --> 47:54.044
No, man,
I'm telling you.

47:54.046 --> 47:55.478
We need to ditch Monroe.
That is... That's it.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.513
He's a fucking thief.

47:56.515 --> 47:57.681
But, Freddy...

47:57.683 --> 47:59.115
it's a good thing.

47:59.117 --> 48:00.417
We agree on this, right?

48:00.419 --> 48:02.018
How are are supposed
to travel

48:02.020 --> 48:04.387
twenty-five hundred miles
in four days?

48:04.389 --> 48:07.724
All I'm saying is
we should buy plane tickets.

48:07.726 --> 48:08.961
With what?

48:13.198 --> 48:14.232
Paul?

48:17.302 --> 48:18.637
What do you say?

48:21.373 --> 48:24.341
I say we talk to Monroe.

48:24.343 --> 48:27.143
I know. I think we have
to behave like a band.

48:27.145 --> 48:28.445
Freddy...

48:28.447 --> 48:30.413
Madge, I'm gonna blow up
in a second.

48:30.415 --> 48:31.450
Freddy.

48:32.317 --> 48:33.352
Freddy.

48:35.754 --> 48:37.122
Enough of this.

48:39.358 --> 48:40.492
I'm calling him.

48:41.226 --> 48:42.728
Al, truly...

48:44.129 --> 48:46.296
clean up in here.
It's just...

48:46.298 --> 48:49.001
Viena, can you have the kids
come and clean this up?

48:50.369 --> 48:52.270
- I'll do it.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

49:03.115 --> 49:04.349
It's not connecting.

49:10.589 --> 49:12.655
- Hey, lady.
- Hey.

49:12.657 --> 49:14.124
Hey, I... I need you to get your
little friends

49:14.126 --> 49:15.193
out of my office.

49:17.095 --> 49:19.429
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll try
and talk to them about that.

49:19.431 --> 49:21.099
Yeah. You do that.

49:43.588 --> 49:46.623
- Hello!
- Hi. What's up?

49:46.625 --> 49:49.726
- Princess.
- Hello, princess.

49:49.728 --> 49:52.796
Ooh, what the fuck is this?

49:52.798 --> 49:55.432
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck is that?

50:02.374 --> 50:04.474
No! I don't want it.

50:04.476 --> 50:07.110
Viena, we found this, like,
bowling alley last night

50:07.112 --> 50:12.615
and Rebecca is like,
national champion best bowler.

50:12.617 --> 50:14.451
She beat, like,
all the locals.

50:14.453 --> 50:17.220
She was so good.

50:17.222 --> 50:18.822
She was so good though,
it was amazing.

50:18.824 --> 50:21.257
And I was, like,
speaking Hebrew the whole time.

50:21.259 --> 50:23.093
It's just...

50:23.095 --> 50:25.595
- We won a motorcycle.
- You did?

50:25.597 --> 50:26.629
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We won...

50:26.631 --> 50:27.831
We won a motorcycle.

50:29.401 --> 50:32.402
It's outside. It could be
a piece of shit.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.571
Oh, no, no. It's gonna
work. We should play on it.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.239
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

50:36.241 --> 50:38.575
I really don't know
if this thing's gonna work.

50:38.577 --> 50:40.443
It works. It works.

50:40.445 --> 50:41.644
You did not know that.

50:44.249 --> 50:45.815
Do you want to come?
You should come.

50:45.817 --> 50:48.353
- Yeah, I'll come in a second.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

51:09.774 --> 51:10.809
Viena.

51:14.913 --> 51:17.413
- I need to ask you something.
- What?

51:17.415 --> 51:19.849
I'm getting a bit freaked
about Freddy.

51:19.851 --> 51:21.319
Give him half of this.

51:29.427 --> 51:30.629
Don't give him more than that.

52:01.960 --> 52:03.361
What do you want?

52:13.772 --> 52:15.807
Let me say one thing.

52:18.410 --> 52:22.879
This Monroe guy is obviously
a crook and all, but

52:22.881 --> 52:25.684
now, he wants to make money off
you guys, right?

52:31.890 --> 52:33.458
Why don't you let him?

52:37.562 --> 52:41.497
Say you open the concert, right?

52:41.499 --> 52:43.668
People get to hear
the new music.

52:45.770 --> 52:47.572
That'll be a good thing,
won't it?

52:52.277 --> 52:54.246
I... I know. It's just...

52:59.651 --> 53:01.286
Would you take the other half?

53:04.356 --> 53:05.991
I don't really like pills.

53:07.626 --> 53:08.660
For me?

53:10.762 --> 53:11.863
Please.

53:39.958 --> 53:41.860
Just give it a minute, okay?

53:56.308 --> 53:57.475
What the fuck?

53:59.377 --> 54:00.610
What're you doing?

54:11.790 --> 54:13.692
Oh, you're so cute.

54:16.961 --> 54:18.963
Every time I see you, I just...

54:20.765 --> 54:22.801
I get pulled in by this...

54:23.668 --> 54:25.537
this thing you have.

54:28.740 --> 54:31.874
I feel you are so pure

54:31.876 --> 54:33.676
that all I need to do is...

54:33.678 --> 54:34.979
is hurt you.

54:39.417 --> 54:42.085
Like I need to harm you

54:42.087 --> 54:43.722
and see you suffering.

54:44.956 --> 54:48.591
- Fuck you.
- Hey, hey.

54:48.593 --> 54:50.593
Listen...

54:50.595 --> 54:53.129
Listen,
I would never hurt you.

54:53.131 --> 54:55.467
Okay? I'm just being honest.

54:57.068 --> 54:59.068
Okay.

54:59.070 --> 55:00.538
I'd never hurt you.

55:03.108 --> 55:04.409
Okay.

55:07.746 --> 55:09.647
I want to tell you something.

55:11.516 --> 55:13.485
I want you to hear me
when I say it.

55:15.954 --> 55:16.986
Hmm?

55:16.988 --> 55:18.588
I'm going to New York tomorrow

55:18.590 --> 55:20.125
and I want you to come with me.

55:22.026 --> 55:24.827
- What?
- Let's go.

55:24.829 --> 55:26.431
You know, together.

55:29.667 --> 55:32.802
You know, if I get to go there

55:32.804 --> 55:35.407
it'll be everything
I've dreamt about for years.

55:38.810 --> 55:39.911
So will you come?

55:49.654 --> 55:51.487
- Hi.
- Oh, hey!

55:51.489 --> 55:53.491
So I'm going to New York.

55:56.828 --> 55:58.628
Alright.

55:58.630 --> 56:01.764
- What about us?
- I don't know.

56:28.993 --> 56:30.128
What's wrong?

56:31.763 --> 56:33.529
I just found out there's
not enough money

56:33.531 --> 56:35.665
coming in from New York.

56:35.667 --> 56:37.802
You know, so it seems like
you can't come.

56:40.872 --> 56:42.638
Okay.

56:42.640 --> 56:44.609
- I can wait here.
- Fuck.

57:08.066 --> 57:09.667
Let's get you packed.

57:28.686 --> 57:31.120
Number of the hotel.
Call me Friday.

57:31.122 --> 57:32.622
That should be enough
for these days.

57:32.624 --> 57:33.856
Okay.

57:33.858 --> 57:36.127
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

57:37.662 --> 57:38.763
We are gonna miss you.

57:49.908 --> 57:51.142
Are you gonna miss me?

57:56.214 --> 57:58.748
I am sorry. I just...

57:58.750 --> 58:00.885
I don't want to
see us kissing, okay?

59:34.012 --> 59:35.046
You okay?

59:38.282 --> 59:40.816
Why are you hanging out
in here by yourself?

59:40.818 --> 59:42.385
I'm just in a bad mood.

59:42.387 --> 59:43.986
Well, do you want to come over?
We're watching,

59:43.988 --> 59:45.923
like, some stupid horror movie.

01:01:11.008 --> 01:01:12.208
Keyes?

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.877
Hey, did I wake you?

01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:16.278
No. What's up?

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.015
- Uh, I need a favor.
- What happened?

01:01:20.017 --> 01:01:22.754
Nothing. I just,
I need you to do something.

01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:51.015
Wait here a minute.

01:02:40.164 --> 01:02:41.530
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

01:02:41.532 --> 01:02:42.865
Yeah, thanks a lot.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.601
Fuck off!

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.113
Well, I got 300.

01:02:57.415 --> 01:02:58.449
Here. Hold that.

01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:43.626
I dropped the bike!

01:03:43.628 --> 01:03:46.030
- What?
- I dropped the bike!

01:03:52.103 --> 01:03:53.271
I'm sorry.

01:04:11.656 --> 01:04:13.157
Bitch.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:15.591
- What?
- Bitch!

01:04:27.438 --> 01:04:29.440
Yo, where the fuck
have you guys been?

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:28.199
Will you stay all night?

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.336
I don't like to be here alone.

01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:36.674
I don't know.
I don't really like it here.

01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:42.213
Please.

01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:45.282
Stay.

01:06:09.573 --> 01:06:11.373
Listen,
this is important. Please.

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:13.210
I just need to talk to Madge.
That's it.

01:06:16.047 --> 01:06:17.148
Hello?

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.461
Where's Keyes?

01:06:32.463 --> 01:06:34.665
Uh, he's out in the woods
somewhere.

01:06:46.677 --> 01:06:48.579
What's going on with you two?

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:51.582
Uh...

01:06:53.284 --> 01:06:55.317
Um, I'm gonna leave you
in charge

01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:57.686
of the money for a bit, okay?

01:06:57.688 --> 01:07:01.625
- Why? I mean, okay, but...
- I'll tell you later.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:29.453
Hi.

01:07:36.627 --> 01:07:37.661
What's wrong?

01:07:39.763 --> 01:07:40.865
Nothing.

01:07:58.516 --> 01:07:59.550
What?

01:08:01.685 --> 01:08:03.254
I think we should leave.

01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:12.528
Go where?

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:13.664
Anywhere.

01:08:15.232 --> 01:08:16.367
Doesn't matter.

01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:19.435
We just leave?

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.742
What if these guys hit it big?

01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:28.845
They're never gonna make it.

01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:34.585
And even if they do,
we don't need them.

01:08:37.955 --> 01:08:39.790
You mean being together?

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:06.649
Viena!

01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:58.000
We should go.

01:10:08.279 --> 01:10:09.580
Mr. Keyes.

01:10:11.348 --> 01:10:12.650
How is everything, man?

01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:15.817
Yeah, I'm alright.
How about you?

01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:17.986
Mm.

01:10:17.988 --> 01:10:20.057
Looks great. Mm.

01:10:21.692 --> 01:10:23.792
I tell you what.

01:10:23.794 --> 01:10:25.796
Things are gonna change
around here.

01:10:27.998 --> 01:10:29.598
Yeah?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.569
Yeah. You can bet on it.

01:10:37.741 --> 01:10:40.309
Listen, guys, I, uh...

01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:44.012
I'm sorry about this, but...

01:10:44.014 --> 01:10:47.785
we're gonna need to find
a solution to this situation.

01:10:49.687 --> 01:10:51.322
Monroe, I want my money.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.091
You want your money?

01:10:57.361 --> 01:10:59.728
How much money do you want?

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:01.965
- Twelve weeks. A grand.
- Hm.

01:11:03.567 --> 01:11:04.702
Okay.

01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:09.871
Here you are.

01:11:09.873 --> 01:11:11.106
Go on.

01:11:11.108 --> 01:11:12.941
But now you're done.

01:11:12.943 --> 01:11:14.078
Alright?

01:11:15.879 --> 01:11:17.014
Alright.

01:11:20.784 --> 01:11:22.017
Can I talk to her?

01:11:22.019 --> 01:11:23.685
- Come on, man.
- What is it?

01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:25.354
- What is it?
- What's the problem?

01:11:25.356 --> 01:11:27.556
You just stay right here
and let me talk to her.

01:11:27.558 --> 01:11:29.524
It's okay. I'm not a wolf.

01:11:29.526 --> 01:11:31.993
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

01:11:31.995 --> 01:11:33.597
I'm just gonna talk to her.

01:11:34.932 --> 01:11:36.800
Okay? Just talk.

01:11:39.403 --> 01:11:40.771
You okay, Keyes?

01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:52.447
Hey.

01:11:52.449 --> 01:11:54.149
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:56.618
So look...

01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.055
I got a crazy kid
on my hands.

01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:03.861
You know, you messed him up.

01:12:05.095 --> 01:12:08.096
I know. You know.

01:12:08.098 --> 01:12:09.698
You think you can
come talk to him for...

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.967
- No, no...
- Hey, hey, hey, Keyes.

01:12:11.969 --> 01:12:14.071
I'm talking about talking.
That's it.

01:12:15.105 --> 01:12:16.473
Okay?

01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:22.744
Hey.

01:12:22.746 --> 01:12:24.646
What do you think?

01:12:24.648 --> 01:12:26.450
You gonna go talk to him for me?

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:28.719
Just talk?

01:12:30.154 --> 01:12:33.588
Think we can go do it now?
Yeah?

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:35.659
Good.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.895
Okay, sweetheart.
Let's do it.

01:12:48.505 --> 01:12:49.540
Keyes.

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:08.792
Come on. We need to talk.

01:13:09.793 --> 01:13:12.093
Freddy.

01:13:12.095 --> 01:13:14.598
You should come with us.
We're gonna get drinks.

01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:19.870
He's not gonna let you in.
Hop in the back.

01:13:42.493 --> 01:13:44.993
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Smash her fucking world.

01:13:44.995 --> 01:13:47.164
- I'm not gonna fucking do it.
- Yes, you fucking are.

01:14:06.116 --> 01:14:08.583
I need to look after him.

01:14:08.585 --> 01:14:10.185
Can you buy the drinks?

01:14:10.187 --> 01:14:12.289
Two whiskeys and two tequilas.

01:14:20.931 --> 01:14:22.666
So, you with the rock band?

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.868
Yeah.

01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:31.742
You okay?

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:34.809
Hey.

01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:36.046
Thank you so much.

01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:40.217
You want to get in with us?

01:15:14.618 --> 01:15:15.719
Go on.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:28.732
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

01:15:32.135 --> 01:15:33.835
- Drink it.
- I don't want anymore. Please.

01:15:33.837 --> 01:15:36.037
- Just drink.
- Please.

01:15:36.039 --> 01:15:38.607
What do you think
we're doing now, hm?

01:15:38.609 --> 01:15:40.077
Drink. Now.

01:15:43.814 --> 01:15:46.648
Fucking drink now. More.

01:15:47.684 --> 01:15:48.819
Good girl.

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:02.099
No. Make her take it.

01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.034
Drink.

01:16:06.036 --> 01:16:07.237
More!

01:16:18.181 --> 01:16:20.017
Ah, you fucked up.

01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:23.720
Gotta restore order.

01:16:28.992 --> 01:16:30.727
I didn't fuck up.

01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.405
...the whole team goes down.

01:16:45.175 --> 01:16:46.875
We gotta do something.

01:16:46.877 --> 01:16:48.145
We gotta, um...

01:16:50.914 --> 01:16:52.215
restore order.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.818
And, uh...

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.787
And you...

01:16:58.789 --> 01:17:01.158
...we need you to help us.

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.961
Help us be strong.

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:09.099
And I need you to not say no.

01:17:14.938 --> 01:17:16.337
Do you understand?

01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:19.710
Open it up.

01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:30.285
You okay?

01:17:30.287 --> 01:17:31.788
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.025
You gotta come with me now,
okay?

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:14.362
My plan is to get the
money they owe me and I'll start

01:18:14.364 --> 01:18:16.765
making those bracelets
I was telling you about.

01:18:16.767 --> 01:18:18.935
I should be able to sell them
anywhere, you know?

01:18:20.437 --> 01:18:22.103
What's all the fuss about?

01:18:22.105 --> 01:18:23.805
Just a bunch of bullshit
those guys do...

01:18:23.807 --> 01:18:26.040
I... I need you to hear this.

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.149
How much longer
are we gonna be here for?

01:18:34.151 --> 01:18:35.318
Shh.

01:18:36.486 --> 01:18:37.521
Listen.

01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:39.556
Listen to this.

01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:04.112
You have any idea
how hard I work

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:05.480
to keep this band on its feet?

01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:09.017
Do you know what I have to do

01:19:09.019 --> 01:19:10.318
to keep this thing together?

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.387
Do you have any idea?

01:19:12.389 --> 01:19:14.055
And you think you're special?

01:19:14.057 --> 01:19:16.291
You can come and you can come
piss on my yard?

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.593
Do you think you're
fucking special?

01:19:18.595 --> 01:19:20.929
Are you special?

01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:22.530
I didn't mean to do anything.

01:19:22.532 --> 01:19:24.265
Yet...

01:19:24.267 --> 01:19:26.267
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

01:19:26.269 --> 01:19:28.937
It's okay.
Shh. S...

01:19:28.939 --> 01:19:29.973
Stop.

01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:35.312
It's not about being sorry.

01:19:36.479 --> 01:19:39.416
Now it's time... to fix it.

01:19:46.022 --> 01:19:47.324
I'll leave you.

01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:58.600
I wish I could be as
composed as he is.

01:19:58.602 --> 01:20:01.402
All of his thoughts
in perfect order.

01:20:01.404 --> 01:20:02.606
He's a brilliant man.

01:20:04.207 --> 01:20:06.574
Here. Drink.

01:20:06.576 --> 01:20:09.346
- I don't want to.
- I know you don't want to.

01:20:12.082 --> 01:20:14.182
There.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:15.550
Please. Please.

01:20:15.552 --> 01:20:17.485
Okay, just one more.

01:20:17.487 --> 01:20:21.391
I said take a fucking drink.
Good girl.

01:20:24.995 --> 01:20:27.397
Just do whatever
he fucking says.

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:09.506
Monroe says
we should calm down.

01:21:16.646 --> 01:21:18.148
He gave me these.

01:21:27.357 --> 01:21:29.025
You should take these.

01:21:35.198 --> 01:21:37.100
No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.969
It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:43.006
Just please take them.

01:21:44.607 --> 01:21:46.309
Here you go.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.513
Please do it.

01:21:52.515 --> 01:21:54.584
There you go, there you go.

01:22:14.704 --> 01:22:16.506
You're gonna be okay.

01:22:18.775 --> 01:22:21.011
Hey, this is what you wanted,
isn't it?

01:22:53.743 --> 01:22:56.177
How many did she take?

01:22:56.179 --> 01:22:59.447
- I don't know, two, three?
- That's bullshit, Freddy.

01:22:59.449 --> 01:23:01.084
How many did you take?

01:23:14.097 --> 01:23:15.532
You're gonna drink this.

01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:23.271
As much as you can.

01:23:23.273 --> 01:23:26.107
I know.

01:23:26.109 --> 01:23:28.311
You gotta throw up those pills
before they take hold.

01:23:33.616 --> 01:23:35.683
Is she okay?

01:23:35.685 --> 01:23:36.751
You got it out of your stomach.

01:23:36.753 --> 01:23:37.785
That's a good thing,

01:23:37.787 --> 01:23:39.087
but you need to stay awake.

01:23:39.089 --> 01:23:40.621
Okay.

01:23:40.623 --> 01:23:42.690
Don't let her fall asleep,
Freddy. Okay.

01:23:42.692 --> 01:23:45.226
You still have
a lot in your system.

01:23:45.228 --> 01:23:48.429
If you fall sleep, it could be
very, very dangerous.

01:23:48.431 --> 01:23:50.264
Okay.

01:23:50.266 --> 01:23:51.801
Keep your eyes open.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.739
You're a fucking idiot, Freddy!

01:24:05.648 --> 01:24:08.251
This is how you wanna get
fucking famous?

01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:38.281
Shh...

01:25:21.758 --> 01:25:23.393
What made you go...

01:27:43.866 --> 01:27:45.435
You okay?
