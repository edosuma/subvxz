00:06.300 --> 00:08.700
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero...

00:08.733 --> 00:12.267
Alaskans battle the clock
to stockpile
for the coming winter.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.000
I got two right here!

00:14.033 --> 00:16.700
NARRATOR: A summer storm
threatens Sue Aikens' trade.

00:16.733 --> 00:19.167
If I don't get the fuel,
the business of Kavik dies.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.567
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate
struggle with a new challenge
on the Yukon.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.833
That's pretty freaking
disappointing, man.

00:24.867 --> 00:28.000
NARRATOR: The Hailstones chase
an elusive food source.

00:28.033 --> 00:30.500
-Get it, baby girl!
-(GUNSHOT)

00:30.533 --> 00:34.433
NARRATOR: And Glenn
protects his camp
from unwelcome guests.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.400
There's something
on the hill there.

00:52.567 --> 00:56.333
Oh, man! This is looking
pretty lonely this year.

00:56.367 --> 00:57.367
(CHUCKLES)

00:58.367 --> 01:00.133
(GROANS)

01:00.167 --> 01:02.133
ANDY:
My clock's ticking right now.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.300
I've got a lot to do
this summer.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.500
I've got a lot that I've gotta
prepare for in the winter,

01:06.533 --> 01:09.667
and one of those things
is putting up fish
for the winter.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.200
Normally, we could just
stick our fish wheel in,

01:12.233 --> 01:17.100
and by the end of the day
I'd probably have 50 pounds
or more of good human food.

01:17.133 --> 01:20.067
And that's no longer
there for us.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.400
The king salmon run has
declined to the point
where they've shut down

01:23.433 --> 01:26.367
all king salmon fishing
on the Yukon River this year.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.600
We've lost probably our
most consistent,

01:28.633 --> 01:31.533
reliable source of protein
for the winter.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.200
(CHOPPING)

01:34.233 --> 01:38.067
This is gonna be kind
of an interesting experiment.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.233
Right now, I'm trying
a new method of fishing.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.300
It's with a fyke net.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.433
A fyke net's basically
just a big funnel trap

01:44.467 --> 01:47.067
with some wings out there
to try and funnel the fish in.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.233
They go into the trap,
they can't find their way out,
and you capture them.

01:51.267 --> 01:53.067
The advantage is
the fish are still alive.

01:53.067 --> 01:56.767
So if you find one that
you don't want, you can
release it unharmed.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.333
If a king salmon
gets in there,

01:58.367 --> 02:02.300
I can let him go without,
without killing him.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.133
That's the way I like
to see them cut.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.433
I'm taking all the moose food.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.267
That's not nice.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.567
(LAUGHS)

02:11.600 --> 02:15.067
ANDY: This method has been
used for 8,000 or 9,000 years

02:15.100 --> 02:17.733
by indigenous people
around the world.

02:17.767 --> 02:19.900
They didn't have nets,
and they didn't have wire,

02:19.933 --> 02:23.433
and they didn't have plastic
floats 9,000 years ago.

02:23.467 --> 02:24.833
So they made everything
out of wood.

02:24.867 --> 02:27.300
It's something I've wanted
to try for a long time,

02:27.333 --> 02:31.767
and the lack of king salmon
is kind of forcing me
to try this method out.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.367
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

02:38.600 --> 02:41.467
Trying to make
my first hoop here.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.067
I'm using a barrel
for a template

02:44.067 --> 02:46.433
just to try and get me
sort of round.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.433
Basically
I'm making a big hoop.

02:48.467 --> 02:52.733
I'm gonna make a slightly
smaller hoop, and then
start attaching my

02:52.767 --> 02:54.733
willow strips to it.

02:54.767 --> 02:57.067
I'm not really sure how strong
I need to make this,

02:57.100 --> 03:00.867
but I think it's
one of those things
that the more I add to it,

03:00.900 --> 03:02.900
the stronger it's gonna get.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.900
You know, I've never made
a hoop trap before.

03:05.933 --> 03:10.333
So much of living out here
is just drawing from
the experiences that you have.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.633
So every new skill and every
new experience you have

03:13.667 --> 03:16.800
gives you some other
foundation for the next thing
you wanna do.

03:16.833 --> 03:20.333
And you'll be able to use it
for something else later on.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.767
Although it's taking
a bunch of time right now,

03:23.800 --> 03:27.567
the payoff might be
pretty good in the future,
I don't know.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.767
I guess that's yet to be seen.
Be another experiment.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.067
But, hey,
that's life on the Yukon.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.067
Every year we gotta deal
with something.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.133
Every year is about adapting.

03:39.167 --> 03:40.333
All right.

03:41.467 --> 03:44.333
So that's,
that's the main bulk of it.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.267
It's a little bit thick
up here.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.133
I might have to add a few
more thinner ones up here,
but that's all right.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.100
It's just gotta hold fish.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.367
It's not gonna be pretty,
but it'll work.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.567
(LAUGHS)

03:56.433 --> 03:59.300
SUE: Know in life
where your needs are,
where your wants are,

03:59.333 --> 04:01.633
what your abilities are,
and kind of marry it up.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.333
This is a heli-crew coming in.

04:19.367 --> 04:22.500
They're gonna be working
out of here, and fuelling out
of here the next few days.

04:22.533 --> 04:25.133
SUE: Hey, how are you doing?
RICK: Hey.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.667
-How you making out?
-Oh, pretty good.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.133
Do you wanna unload
your stuff and get
to get your rooms?

04:30.467 --> 04:32.867
Might as well lighten up
the load a little bit.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.800
SUE: Kavik is sort of
a twisted bed and breakfast.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.200
During the summer people come.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.767
Whatever your business
is in the Arctic,

04:39.800 --> 04:42.300
I give you a place to sleep
and some food for your beak.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.467
The majority of people want
a little bit of comfort,

04:44.500 --> 04:46.100
and that's my
little niche here.

04:46.133 --> 04:49.900
You can be in the wild
of the Arctic,

04:49.933 --> 04:54.300
but yet have a trailer
and some creature comforts.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.700
In the winter, not many people
are making it out here
to buy fuel or stay here,

04:58.733 --> 05:02.067
but from the middle of June
through sometime in the middle
of September,

05:02.100 --> 05:06.467
those are all the months that
I get to make the revenue
to keep this place profitable.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.067
I mean, it is not inexpensive
to do what I do.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.967
But you know, why do I do it?

05:12.067 --> 05:15.300
To afford the style of life
I wanna live
the rest of the year.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.400
You know, if I work
my ass off for three months,

05:17.433 --> 05:19.733
then I got nine months
I can play and live.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.133
So it's a fair enough trade.

05:22.167 --> 05:24.100
NARRATOR: For Sue Aikens,

05:24.133 --> 05:28.267
the arrival of clients
in Kavik means she must get
vital resources into camp

05:28.300 --> 05:31.067
or risk losing
crucial revenue.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.067
SUE: One of the most elemental
things I need to have
available is water.

05:38.100 --> 05:43.467
I have to get water out
of the river and pumped
in through the system.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.367
I'm gonna head down
to the river.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.400
I wanna see what the water,
what the river
is looking like.

05:49.433 --> 05:53.933
I must have a clearer water
to pump into my water system.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.567
The major problem for me,

05:56.600 --> 06:03.067
this has been just, um,
atypically wet spring
and summer.

06:03.067 --> 06:07.300
All the rain,
all this deluge,
the water hits the tundra,

06:07.333 --> 06:10.100
and it all wants to live
at the lowest point
which is the rivers.

06:10.133 --> 06:15.233
But it churns it up,
and that has kept me
from being able to pump.

06:15.267 --> 06:18.867
Yeah, this is not,
this is not
looking good at all.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.433
Can't really pump that, and
it's not even real safe to get
too close to the edge,

06:22.467 --> 06:24.967
'cause it's undercutting
my bank.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.300
That current is real swift.

06:29.767 --> 06:33.100
And that's a big old pile
of mud.
I'll continue to check it.

06:33.133 --> 06:37.667
As soon as I see that I can
at least read through it
with no problems,

06:37.700 --> 06:41.800
and not have dirt, you know,
then I'll be pumping it.

06:41.833 --> 06:45.200
It's a done deal, loose wheel.
Check it again tomorrow.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.133
GLENN: What goes
through the mind,
the stream of consciousness,

06:50.167 --> 06:53.333
how you feel, how you
experience reality each day

06:53.367 --> 06:56.633
is affected by the spaces
you occupy.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.400
Bear came along and ripped up
my sod house again.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.067
Bears seem to be attracted
to this place.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.900
Every now and then they'll
come and of course it smells
like food in there.

07:15.933 --> 07:17.533
I've had meat
hanging in there,

07:17.567 --> 07:20.167
and the bears will come
and rip the place up
when I'm away from camp.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.167
So it's something that is
a continuous thing.

07:22.200 --> 07:27.067
This sod house works out
pretty well for storing food
most of the time.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.400
But I thought that for smaller
amounts of food,

07:29.433 --> 07:32.933
if I just dug a hole straight
down into the ground,
a smaller hole,

07:32.967 --> 07:36.767
it might actually keep it
even cooler than
this sod house does.

07:36.800 --> 07:42.100
And also, the bears
might be less interested
in digging into it.

07:42.133 --> 07:44.833
I'm looking around
for a spot to put
this little refrigerator,

07:44.867 --> 07:47.067
and the main thing
I'm thinking about
is convenience.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.567
I wanna be able to go
in and out of it easily.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.133
So I could put it right here
in the front yard somewhere.

07:52.167 --> 07:56.267
The problem with this though
is the sun is to the south
during the day,

07:56.300 --> 07:58.467
and it'll be beating down
on this hole.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.533
I'd rather have it in
a place that's shaded.

08:01.567 --> 08:05.600
So I'm thinking if I put it
on the north side
of the cabin,

08:05.633 --> 08:07.300
that might be the best spot.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.400
If I dig the hole right here,

08:11.433 --> 08:13.800
during the middle of the day
it'll be in the shade.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.300
That might be
the best spot for it.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.367
NARRATOR: Isolated
in the Brooks Range,

08:17.400 --> 08:20.133
Glenn relies on 10 years
of experience to survive

08:20.167 --> 08:23.700
the Arctic's predators
and gruelling weather.

08:23.733 --> 08:25.533
Without access to power tools,

08:25.567 --> 08:29.700
he must build each structure
in camp with the resources
around him.

08:32.267 --> 08:35.167
GLENN: In the summer
it can get up into the 80s
here sometimes.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.467
I've seen it 85 degrees.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.500
Cooler ground is going to
help me to preserve food.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.767
It's just like putting it
in a refrigerator.

08:46.167 --> 08:49.067
The gravely soil
is well drained.

08:49.067 --> 08:53.233
I should be able to dig down
in here a few feet
without getting wet.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.100
That feels nice
and cool down here.

09:00.133 --> 09:02.467
Got a nice sized hole.
Onto the next step.

09:07.767 --> 09:11.500
So, I'm looking for some
spruce trees in order to line
my refrigerator with them,

09:11.533 --> 09:14.467
and a lot of the trees
around here
just aren't suitable.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.467
If I use trees
that are too big,

09:17.500 --> 09:20.567
it's gonna take up a lot
of space in that hole
that I dug.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.100
If they're too small,

09:22.133 --> 09:25.300
think of how many I'll need
to build the height
of the wall.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.067
So this is the happy medium.

09:27.100 --> 09:31.333
One I can reach around
about that big.
That's a good-sized tree.

09:31.367 --> 09:34.333
If I wanted to run
a modern refrigerator
or freezer out here,

09:34.367 --> 09:36.867
I'd have to have propane or
I'd have to have gasoline

09:36.900 --> 09:40.333
to run a generator
all the time
and produce electricity.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.433
I don't wanna get into those
complicated systems.

09:42.467 --> 09:48.267
This is just simple.
It serves my needs.
Why get more complicated?

09:48.300 --> 09:50.167
CHIP: We're always thinking
about the future.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.533
You know, you wanna
stock things up.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.533
You wanna prepare yourself
for later life.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.567
All that stuff.
You watch your kids grow.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.467
You think about the things
you wanna accomplish,
and you work towards them.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.200
But you know,
we live in today.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.067
We enjoy every day for today.

10:11.667 --> 10:15.367
Carol, you gotta get you
a weapon of your choice.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.900
NARRATOR: Chip
and Agnes Hailstone

10:16.933 --> 10:20.167
spend their summers
in Kiwalik,
harvesting meat for the winter

10:20.200 --> 10:24.500
and teaching their daughters
native hunting methods
critical at this time of year.

10:24.533 --> 10:27.067
There's not very many ducks
or geese flying,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.033
so they must be moulting.

10:29.067 --> 10:31.200
So, we're gonna go out and go

10:31.233 --> 10:34.000
take a walk towards the lakes
and ponds back there,

10:34.033 --> 10:38.600
and go see
what the birds are doing.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.367
CHIP: The summertime
the females are off
raising their babies,

10:41.400 --> 10:43.467
and the males all fly
to lakes and stuff.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.033
When they moult,
their feathers are coming out,
they're growing new ones.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.433
They're flightless
for about maybe a week or so.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.933
They're grouped up
for mutual protection.

10:49.967 --> 10:52.867
It gives a chance of getting
a bunch of ducks at one time.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.700
The thing is that birds leave.

10:54.733 --> 10:58.667
They migrate south and we
don't see them till maybe
next May, next June.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.667
So it doesn't give us
much time to get at 'em.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.533
Whoo! Watch out, pup. Sorry!

11:04.567 --> 11:06.533
AGNES: We're not gonna
use any firearms,

11:06.567 --> 11:09.933
but I am gonna carry some
in case the bears or other
animals come around.

11:09.967 --> 11:13.167
But we're gonna take our clubs
and our paddles.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.933
CHIP: Whack it.
This is a harpoon.

11:14.967 --> 11:18.100
If there's a duck or
something, I can spear it
or I can whack it.

11:18.133 --> 11:19.367
Yep, beat it in the head.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.333
This is actually
a legal way to hunt.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.133
It's way cheaper
to do a hunt this way.

11:24.167 --> 11:29.067
We don't have to use any ammo
or anything but our energy
to try to catch them.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.267
-Shall we?
-Yup.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.567
Come on, puppy dog.
Let's go.

11:38.767 --> 11:44.133
CHIP: These are big mud flats.
This is where the valley
meets the ocean.

11:44.167 --> 11:47.067
It's a little deep here,
girls.

11:47.067 --> 11:52.233
This is swampy, mushy, marshy.
This is a very difficult walk.
Climb aboard.

11:52.267 --> 11:53.567
Ugh!

11:53.600 --> 11:55.167
CHIP: There's a lot
of places where
the moss is really deep.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.233
There's a lot of places where
the mud is really deep.

11:57.267 --> 12:00.800
People trip,
twist their ankles,
fracture their ankles.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.967
All kinds of bad things
can happen on this tundra

12:03.067 --> 12:04.200
when you're walking it
with heavy loads.

12:04.233 --> 12:07.167
So you try to take it
as light as possible.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.600
AGNES: We reached the lakes,
Qutan.

12:10.633 --> 12:14.433
You gotta keep you girls' eyes
open for ducks now and stuff.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.533
CHIP: Why don't you guys
get on that side,

12:16.567 --> 12:19.367
and I'll go along this edge
and see what I can knock out.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.967
Try not to go too far ahead.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.767
Just don't shotgun...

12:22.800 --> 12:24.667
-Good luck.
-Yup.

12:25.933 --> 12:27.600
CHIP: Good luck, ladies.

12:38.367 --> 12:40.067
Just baby ducks.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.367
AGNES: There goes puppy.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.700
I've been watching
the puppy dog, and it's been
running all over the place,

12:47.733 --> 12:51.467
and I haven't seen it scare
any birds or ducks up yet.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.067
So, we're just gonna keep
going around the lake.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.567
CHIP: There's a bunch
of ducks. Oh, right there.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.467
Keep walking. Keep walking.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.367
Now.

13:25.967 --> 13:28.067
CHIP: Get it!
Hit it again!

13:28.067 --> 13:29.267
You got it. Get it.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.567
Just reach down
and grab it with your hand.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.233
Hurry up!
It's getting away.

13:33.267 --> 13:36.133
-Grab it before it go.
-Hurry up! Grab it!
It's not gonna hurt you!

13:36.167 --> 13:37.667
AGNES: Oh, get him.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.067
Ooh!

13:40.100 --> 13:42.667
CHIP: Just wring its neck.
AGNES: That's called
cup of soup.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.067
We got a cup of soup.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.067
We always call them when
they're small like that.

13:46.100 --> 13:51.567
They're just right for just
a cup of soup, but that's
Carol's first one.

13:51.600 --> 13:56.333
So, we'll get to have some
real good soup broth later.

13:57.933 --> 13:59.167
Right on, Carol.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.067
Got a duck without
a shotgun shell.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.167
Carol's duck.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.267
That's how you girls
have to do it.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.400
CHIP: Carol got herself
a duck sight unseen.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.067
I pointed it out to her,
and she, she whacked it.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.800
Did a good job, too,
of bringing it in.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.667
So, I was pretty happy
with that.

14:15.700 --> 14:19.433
We'll flip the duck up
in the rafter and save it
till we get some more.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.433
One little duck ain't
gonna feed nobody.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.967
Yeah, one duck is not gonna
feed all of us, huh?

14:24.067 --> 14:26.200
CHIP: Nope. That's all right.
It's a start.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.533
We'll get a couple more
ducks tomorrow maybe.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.400
GLENN: To be
connected to nature.

14:32.433 --> 14:35.300
It's just fascinating
all the stuff that's going on

14:35.333 --> 14:38.067
when you start
paying attention.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.200
Every year
I learn something new.

14:45.833 --> 14:47.600
(SAWING)

14:47.633 --> 14:49.400
NARRATOR: In order to
preserve his food

14:49.433 --> 14:52.333
and keep it safe from
predators and the elements,

14:52.367 --> 14:57.733
Glenn must use the resources
surrounding his camp to build
a new refrigeration unit.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.267
GLENN: I like variety.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.800
I would not get into
the business of digging
refrigerator holes

15:01.833 --> 15:03.600
repetitively for a living,

15:03.633 --> 15:06.167
but if I only have to build
one in my lifetime,
it's a lot of fun.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.500
Needs to be a little longer.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.900
I can put five gallon
buckets in there.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.300
I can probably fit four
of them in there.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.267
Berries, fish, whatever
I wanna put down in there.

15:14.300 --> 15:18.067
Meat, it's gonna stay much
cooler on hot days.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.633
And that's gonna help me
to keep food longer.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.067
I think that's gonna do it.

15:22.067 --> 15:24.467
That's high enough
for the walls.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.833
Now that I've got
the walls in,

15:25.867 --> 15:27.733
the next thing I need to do
is put a covering on it.

15:27.767 --> 15:31.567
I need some kind of lid that
I can open and close
relatively easily,

15:31.600 --> 15:36.433
but that is going to insulate
and keep the warm air out
and the cold air in.

15:37.933 --> 15:41.667
These started out as tepee
poles, 14 years ago
I cut them.

15:41.700 --> 15:45.100
Then I shortened them to make
a tent that I could use
in the winter.

15:45.133 --> 15:49.433
Now I'm gonna cut them again,
and I'm gonna use them as part
of my refrigerator lid.

15:49.467 --> 15:55.767
I wouldn't know the materials
if I just bought them
in a store.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.600
I would describe it as a more
intimate relationship with
the things that I'm using.

15:59.633 --> 16:03.667
They don't come from
some far off distant place.
I know their history.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.300
I watch the trees
grow around me.

16:05.333 --> 16:09.367
I watch the lake every day.
I watch the animals I eat.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.100
That'll be the lid
right there.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.500
I just need to get
some insulation.

16:13.533 --> 16:16.300
I'll get a nice, thick piece
of moss to put
over the top of this.

16:16.333 --> 16:20.167
I'll cut it right here,
and I'll be able
to just lift that up.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.567
I'm gonna go grab some moss.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.200
This looks like a nice patch
of moss right here.

16:31.067 --> 16:33.500
I just want it approximately
the right size.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.167
It's not easy
to find good moss,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.733
because there are a lot
of roots and trees
in the ground.

16:37.767 --> 16:42.867
I want a one continuous piece
for that door.
A nice thick piece.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.133
It's all attached
at the bottom by roots.
So I have to dig.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.533
(GRUNTS)

16:55.600 --> 17:00.233
Out here you don't have
to try to stay in shape.

17:00.267 --> 17:03.067
The way I live without
machinery, there's no choice.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.567
All I have to do is
try it on for size.

17:10.267 --> 17:11.800
Should fit right in there.

17:16.533 --> 17:18.100
Got my refrigerator.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.400
That should work great.

17:22.067 --> 17:25.433
ANDY: Most people
don't wanna change until
they're forced to change,

17:25.467 --> 17:27.200
and we're being
forced to change.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.067
So, you can't cry about it.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.267
You just gotta get out there
and do what you can,
and try and get by.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.500
That's what life out
in the bush is all about.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.233
-Let's go catch some fish!
-Yee-haw!

17:47.267 --> 17:49.767
NARRATOR: With salmon fishing
closed on the Yukon,

17:49.800 --> 17:52.600
Andy and Kate Bassich
are trying a new fish trap

17:52.633 --> 17:55.833
to stock up enough food
before the freeze
overtakes the river.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.533
We're gonna take this fyke
trap four miles downriver
to a slough.

17:59.567 --> 18:03.233
I'm gonna set it in this
slough to try and avoid
catching king salmon.

18:03.267 --> 18:06.267
King salmon do not travel up
these back sloughs.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.133
Especially a dead end slough.

18:08.167 --> 18:12.467
So this is the habitat that
a lot of pike, whitefish,
and sheefish live in.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.467
So, that's where
I'm gonna go after 'em.

18:15.400 --> 18:19.267
Let me go find
the deepest spot.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.100
I think right here would
probably be a good place
for the cod end.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.933
Why don't you take the wings,
and just hold the wings out,
out there.

18:25.967 --> 18:27.967
We'll get them
untangled later.

18:28.067 --> 18:29.567
In we go.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.467
Now the question is,
is it gonna float or not?

18:34.500 --> 18:38.067
It's gonna need a little bit
of downward pressure.

18:41.067 --> 18:44.633
Nothing's gonna get by
the pike slayer.

18:46.633 --> 18:47.633
(LAUGHS)

18:48.967 --> 18:51.500
ANDY: Okay,
I think we're set, babe.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.900
ANDY: What do you think?
KATE: I think it looks great.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.667
I think this'll work
pretty good.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.600
See, it looks like the Yukon's
pushing in a little bit
right now. See it?

18:59.633 --> 19:03.233
Certainly anything coming into
the slough isn't gonna
get by it. That's for sure.

19:03.267 --> 19:09.067
I'll check it tomorrow
morning, and if it's
catching fish... Yee-haw.

19:13.467 --> 19:16.500
I don't mind putting work in
as long as I'm gonna have

19:16.533 --> 19:18.233
long-term benefits
from that work.

19:18.267 --> 19:21.900
It makes all that hard work
that you put
into living this way,

19:21.933 --> 19:25.067
uh, have some meaning,
and it's a payoff.

19:31.133 --> 19:33.400
What do you think?

19:33.433 --> 19:35.533
-Four fish.
-(LAUGHS)

19:35.567 --> 19:38.900
I'm not gonna even bet today.
I got a feeling.

19:38.933 --> 19:40.933
We're gonna catch
something today.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.333
Water is up today.

19:42.367 --> 19:45.067
Looks like it came up
about six inches last night.

19:45.067 --> 19:48.433
So I'm hoping that's
gonna push some fish
into this slough.

19:48.467 --> 19:51.067
We're hoping for,
I don't know,
half a dozen maybe.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.733
But I'll be happy with
one or two just to make sure
that the trap is working.

19:54.767 --> 19:57.433
Here fishy, fishy.

19:57.467 --> 20:00.233
KATE: My fingers crossed.
(MIMICS FANFARE)

20:04.167 --> 20:05.433
Nothing in this end.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.400
There is something
in the back, isn't there?

20:07.433 --> 20:09.900
-No, that's the,
that's the bait.
-Oh, that's the bait.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.233
Yeah, I don't think
we got anything, Kate.

20:11.267 --> 20:13.667
I'm wondering if they're
getting out of the trap here.

20:13.700 --> 20:17.333
'Cause we should...
We should've caught something.

20:20.367 --> 20:21.367
Nope.

20:22.867 --> 20:24.033
It's a bust.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.667
(LAUGHS)

20:27.700 --> 20:30.733
That's pretty frickin'
disappointing, man.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.467
I'm wondering
if they're getting out.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.167
I don't think I made it
tight enough or whatever.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.633
KATE: So, what do we do?
Bring it home, work on it?

20:41.667 --> 20:43.833
Yeah, maybe I ought
to just bring it home.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.300
Here, let me...

20:46.367 --> 20:48.433
Let me pull
the rest of this stuff

20:50.133 --> 20:53.200
and go back and spend
more time on this.

20:53.233 --> 20:56.833
As much as I don't really
feel like putting the time
into this right now,

20:56.867 --> 20:58.467
I've pretty much
gotta do it.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.800
Time is precious for us
in the summertime.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.133
I got so many projects
I gotta get going on.

21:03.167 --> 21:04.967
That's why I'm feeling
a little agitated.

21:05.067 --> 21:07.200
Summers are just
too short here.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.067
There's just too much to do.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.133
SUE: It's a land of extremes.

21:13.167 --> 21:17.667
If you are a person
that needs to maintain
the illusion of control,

21:17.700 --> 21:20.800
you're not gonna do
well out here at all.

21:29.867 --> 21:34.967
Well, it's definitely, uh...
Well, it's summertime.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.600
It just doesn't feel like it.

21:36.633 --> 21:39.367
I mean, this is the typically
atypical weather
on the north slope.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.900
The only thing you can
count on is the fact that
you can't count on anything.

21:43.933 --> 21:47.233
Been a really, really,
really wet summer.

21:47.267 --> 21:50.833
And Mother Nature turned on
the AC today.

21:50.867 --> 21:53.133
So this, this definitely

21:53.967 --> 21:56.600
is getting in the way, again,

21:56.633 --> 21:59.100
of me being able to get
a fuel delivery, you know.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.067
I'm out here at the fuel shed

22:01.067 --> 22:05.567
trying to get ready for it
to come in, and the weather
came in instead.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.100
The plane had
to be turned around,

22:07.133 --> 22:09.433
and they're gonna call it
for the whole weekend.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.267
So, I'm just
kind of boned again.

22:14.567 --> 22:18.367
I've really got to start
getting concerned.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.067
You know,
I'm still selling fuel.

22:20.067 --> 22:22.333
I'm now getting
to the point where

22:22.367 --> 22:25.367
I have to get the fuel
or these planes aren't gonna
be able to fly.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.800
It's not so much that,
you know,

22:27.833 --> 22:29.833
if I don't get the fuel,
I'm gonna die.

22:29.867 --> 22:33.400
If I don't get the fuel,
the business of Kavik dies.

22:33.433 --> 22:37.133
It's that integral to
the survival of the business.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.333
It's been a couple
of weeks since I've been able
to pump water.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.233
So I need to get down
to the river,

22:49.267 --> 22:52.067
and if it's clear enough
at all, you know,

22:52.067 --> 22:55.133
then I can pump
and get back up to full speed.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.967
It's looking better than
it has for a few days.

22:59.067 --> 23:00.767
It's certainly not ready
to pump,

23:00.800 --> 23:03.167
but it's looking a lot better.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.467
That's actually
not bad at all.
I can filter that.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.467
We should probably pump.

23:11.367 --> 23:13.067
(MOTOR STARTING)

23:14.300 --> 23:16.200
Kind of works out for them
some of the time,

23:16.233 --> 23:21.067
but there's a misperception
that they have some control
over what happens.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.600
In Alaska, we will all
down to a T,

23:23.633 --> 23:26.200
say that weather is king.

23:26.233 --> 23:29.300
It controls what we can hunt,
what's in the area,

23:29.333 --> 23:32.567
whether you can get water
or you can't get water.

23:32.600 --> 23:37.300
Every aspect of your life
is governed by
what the whims of nature are.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.067
You take it as it comes.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.300
So, now that it's pumping,

23:44.133 --> 23:47.600
I can go anywhere on this line
and feel it running.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.533
Now it's time to go back in.

23:50.567 --> 23:53.400
See where it's at
in my initial tank.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.767
This is what I wanna see.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.800
So, it's gone
through the main filter.

23:58.833 --> 24:02.233
As it's coming in,
another filter here.
Three filters there.

24:02.267 --> 24:06.333
Inline injected
parts per billion
on the chlorine additive.

24:06.833 --> 24:08.233
Into the tank.

24:08.267 --> 24:11.133
When you have the chance,
you grab your liquid gold.

24:11.167 --> 24:14.867
90% of the revenue I need
to make is gonna be in
the next four to six weeks,

24:14.900 --> 24:18.300
and if I can't give them
the services they've come
to expect,

24:18.333 --> 24:20.833
I'm not gonna make
that revenue.

24:20.867 --> 24:25.533
So, this is, uh...
This is definitely
a feather in my cap.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.167
CHIP: We're always thinking
about the future,

24:29.200 --> 24:31.933
and saving food for tomorrow.

24:31.967 --> 24:34.167
You know, you can't hold onto
it like money in the bank.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.667
You gotta let it go.
It all disappears.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.267
It's a consumable commodity.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.067
So, we're always looking
for more.

24:48.433 --> 24:52.267
AGNES: So, you guys wanna just
get ready and go
do this again? Qutan?

24:53.133 --> 24:55.533
Go find more ducks and all?

24:55.567 --> 24:57.700
This is another day
in the life.

24:57.733 --> 25:00.233
But today I think we're gonna
go look for ducks again.

25:00.267 --> 25:02.633
If we wanna get some ducks,
we just gotta find
a nice bunch of 'em.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.100
It's not always easy.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.067
Certainly every pond doesn't
have a duck,

25:07.067 --> 25:09.200
and there's thousands
of ponds here.

25:09.233 --> 25:11.533
This is
a tidal flats down here.

25:11.567 --> 25:14.067
So, ducks shift from area
to area as they feed,

25:14.067 --> 25:16.500
but we're gonna find where
there's a big group
of 'em somewhere.

25:16.533 --> 25:18.767
Gotta be a big group
of 'em somewhere.

25:18.800 --> 25:19.900
Ready, kiddo?

25:19.933 --> 25:21.633
Come grab your harpoon.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.133
-Try not to bend
those, baby girl.
-Okay.

25:24.167 --> 25:27.067
CHIP: Bye-bye, puppy.
Too bad you can't come.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.700
You scare away too many ducks.

25:28.733 --> 25:30.700
CHIP: Come on, kiddos.
You ready?

25:39.200 --> 25:40.700
AGNES: Even though we're
kind of sore and tired

25:40.733 --> 25:43.633
from walking yesterday
all along the lakes and stuff,

25:43.667 --> 25:46.233
we're still gonna go
do this again today.

25:46.267 --> 25:49.467
'Cause we have just
a short limited time
we can actually do this

25:49.500 --> 25:51.367
while the ducks and birds
are all moulting

25:51.400 --> 25:53.300
and they can't fly
and get away from us.

25:53.333 --> 25:56.600
So, we're just gonna
keep on walking
sloughs and lakes

25:56.633 --> 26:00.433
and just hopefully
come across a flock of birds.

26:00.467 --> 26:01.900
What do you see over there?

26:01.933 --> 26:03.867
CHIP: I think I see ducks,

26:03.900 --> 26:07.100
but I don't know what kind.
So, gonna go have a look.

AGNES: We're getting close.
Let's keep going.

26:19.367 --> 26:22.067
What they do is just
keep running, trying
to get away from us,

26:22.100 --> 26:24.233
and we have to really
keep moving.

26:24.267 --> 26:29.067
They're a little excited,
but hopefully the birds
will calm down

26:29.067 --> 26:32.233
and we'll have another chance
at getting some.

26:32.267 --> 26:33.767

coming to us.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.067
They are? Where?

-They're right there!
-Right where?

out of the water.

of 'em over there.
AGNES: They're coming to us.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.733
I see 'em.
They're really watching us.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.100
So how we gonna do this?

26:46.133 --> 26:47.600
You go wide this way.

26:47.633 --> 26:50.133
Me and Carol will go wide
this way if you take Qutan.

26:50.167 --> 26:51.667

on where we are,

26:51.700 --> 26:54.300
-and do some good
shotgunning, huh?
-Yeah.

26:54.333 --> 26:55.633
Yep. Don't be afraid
to use that shotgun.

26:55.667 --> 26:58.100
Me and Carol will block off
the rest on the way

26:58.133 --> 26:59.567
and we'll whack them
with our sticks.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.333
Come, Qutan. Ducks are moving.

27:03.367 --> 27:07.067

It's all teamwork.
Even though my daughter
Qutan didn't kill one,

29:32.267 --> 29:34.533
she was making her presence
by running back and forth

to go to her.

no caribou around,

any this year

were all grouped up together
for mutual protection.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.333
Nine.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.133

bulky and big

30:38.167 --> 30:40.033

they couldn't hide so well,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.367
Well, that will make
some jars of geese

30:51.400 --> 30:54.267
and we can eat a couple,
three or four fresh.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.233
We'll eat a couple of these
and we'll have about 10 good
jars of geese.

30:57.267 --> 30:59.133
Since we don't have any
in the freezer
for this winter,

30:59.167 --> 31:01.467
we'll save those aside
to make a huge pot
of goose soup

-Yeah.

Part of the big cycle.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.700
Right here this is where
I'll start walking looking
for the berries.

31:43.733 --> 31:45.433
NARRATOR:
High in the Brooks Range,

31:45.467 --> 31:48.367
Glenn has a brief opportunity
to gather berries

31:48.400 --> 31:50.767
before winter
overtakes the land.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.167
I like to walk on
these low ridges
that are drier,

31:55.067 --> 31:56.600
gravelly soil.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.067
Less brush, easier walking.

32:02.767 --> 32:06.067
Hey, this looks like
some mushrooms
I can eat right here.

32:06.100 --> 32:10.967
There are other mushrooms
that look very similar to this
that are poisonous.

32:11.067 --> 32:13.067
But this one has
an orange-ish colour,

32:13.100 --> 32:16.100
and when I break it I can tell

32:17.100 --> 32:19.300
that that's the type
I'm looking for.

32:19.333 --> 32:23.067
Something else I can take back
and stick in the fridge.

32:28.833 --> 32:32.433
Oh, here's a nice patch
of blueberries right here.

32:32.467 --> 32:34.933
Some good enough berries here
to stop and pick for a while.

32:34.967 --> 32:38.567
With this berry picker,
I can pick faster.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.933
There are a lot of different
plants that you can eat,

32:40.967 --> 32:44.867
but there are some plants
out here that can kill you
if you eat them.

32:44.900 --> 32:48.100
So you wanna know which ones
are edible and which ones
are poisonous.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.600
What's that?

33:00.067 --> 33:01.500
There's something
on the hill there.

33:01.533 --> 33:04.233
I'll have closer look
with my rifle.

33:05.367 --> 33:07.600
Something up there
moving through the trees.

33:08.233 --> 33:09.500
I'm not sure what it is.

33:09.933 --> 33:11.267
It's brown.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.567
It's a moose.

33:16.967 --> 33:20.100
Yeah, I can see now
it's a moose.

33:20.133 --> 33:22.733
It's always a good idea
to keep an eye on something
like that though,

33:22.767 --> 33:24.500
'cause there are bears around.

33:24.533 --> 33:26.633
Still another month until
I hunt moose.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.367
Moose season's later
in the fall.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.067
I got a couple gallons
of berries now.

33:30.100 --> 33:32.633
I'm gonna head back to camp
and on the way
I'll be canoeing,

33:32.667 --> 33:34.067
I can do some fishing.

33:34.067 --> 33:37.333
There might be some pike
or some whitefish along
the way I can catch.

33:45.833 --> 33:48.067
This is just
a small lake way up
in the mountains.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.767
I'm a long, long ways
from the ocean.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.767
So I don't get fish migrating
into this lake from the ocean.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.433
I live mostly on moose meat
and caribou out here.

33:55.467 --> 33:59.367
I have a fish once in a great
while for variety. I like it.

34:06.367 --> 34:07.533
I got something.

34:11.767 --> 34:13.533
There.

34:13.567 --> 34:18.800
I'm gonna keep fishing
because the fish are biting.

34:18.833 --> 34:23.300
When you're up in
the mountains a long ways
from the ocean,

34:23.333 --> 34:26.067
it's not the same kind
of fishing you get

34:26.067 --> 34:28.300
when you're
in a big river system

34:28.333 --> 34:31.400
where the fish are going
in and out to the ocean.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.633
Getting some food
for the fridge.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.367
One way to get a refrigerator
is to go to the store
and buy it,

34:45.400 --> 34:48.600
bring it home,
plug it in to electricity,
you got your refrigerator.

34:48.633 --> 34:51.067
What I had to do here,
I dug a hole,

34:51.067 --> 34:52.933
lined it with spruce trees,

34:52.967 --> 34:56.467
found myself a piece of moss
that will insulate
for the lid.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.333
It was an experiment.
I never built
a refrigerator before.

34:59.367 --> 35:02.067
I'm really happy with the way
this turned out.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.900
What a way to live, you know?

35:03.933 --> 35:06.700
Go out and pick my fruit
in the forest,

35:07.767 --> 35:09.267
catch my fish in the lake.

35:09.300 --> 35:12.300
I prefer it to any restaurant
in the world.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.233
ANDY: Consistent access
to the resources
is our insurance

35:17.267 --> 35:19.067
out here in the bush.

35:19.067 --> 35:22.700
You take that away from us
and it really
affects our lives

35:23.467 --> 35:25.600
directly and immediately.

35:44.467 --> 35:48.167
I'm trying to figure out
how the heck I'm gonna
do this. (LAUGHS)

35:48.200 --> 35:50.967
Without taking the whole
bloody thing apart, you know?

35:51.067 --> 35:55.067
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate's,
new fish trap has failed
to yield any fish.

35:55.067 --> 35:56.767
They must repair it if
they hope to harvest

35:56.800 --> 35:59.200
enough food for themselves
this winter.

35:59.233 --> 36:03.133
I gotta add... I gotta add
more willows in here,
obviously. Right?

36:03.167 --> 36:05.400
If they came through here,
they could get out here.

36:05.433 --> 36:08.267
I just didn't get
them close enough together.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.467
Clock's ticking,
fall's just around the corner,

36:11.500 --> 36:14.467
and basically we haven't
put up any fish.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.833
And that's a real big concern
for me.

36:16.867 --> 36:19.067
Like that size?

36:19.067 --> 36:22.067
It doesn't matter.
Even smaller than that
will work probably for me.

36:22.067 --> 36:26.767
For every king salmon
I used to catch, I now have
to catch about 10 pike.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.233
And that's turning out to be
not as easy as I thought
it would be.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.600
Okay. I think we
got everything, huh?

36:50.567 --> 36:53.600
-Okay. I think we're fishing.
-Okay.

36:53.633 --> 36:55.867
Check it tomorrow,
swear some more tomorrow

36:55.900 --> 36:57.833
(LAUGHING)
when it doesn't have
any fish in it.

36:57.867 --> 37:01.067
Tomorrow morning there's
no betting on whether
we get any fish or not.

37:01.067 --> 37:04.100
-No. We won't even...
We won't even discuss it.
-(LAUGHING)

37:09.267 --> 37:11.200
It's undisturbed.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.367
-Well, it's still underwater.
-Yeah.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.767
That's a good sign.
All right.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.167
Let's see what we got.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.600
KATE: I think so. No.

37:30.567 --> 37:32.267
Negatory, it looks like.

37:34.133 --> 37:36.133
Son of a bitch!

37:36.167 --> 37:39.200
Well, this is obviously
not producing at all.

37:39.233 --> 37:42.200
And we're spending
a lot of time and gasoline

37:42.233 --> 37:44.900
and we're not getting
a damn thing out of this.

37:44.933 --> 37:49.167
I'm kind of baffled as to
why I'm not catching
fish right now, here.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.967
I mean, I've got
it completely closed off

37:52.067 --> 37:54.300
so anything coming in,
it's gotta come in here.

37:54.333 --> 37:57.867
I can't, I can't imagine
the fish are going in
and then coming back out.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.933
So for some reason we're
just not getting them here.

38:00.967 --> 38:04.300
We know there are fish at
the mouth, right at the mouth.

38:04.333 --> 38:07.667
We know they travel along
the edges, right?

38:07.700 --> 38:10.367
So let's just give that a shot
and see what happens.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.067
I've been fishing it for days
and so far I haven't
caught anything.

38:13.067 --> 38:14.900
So I don't know
if it's my design,

38:14.933 --> 38:17.367
or if there just aren't
any fish here.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.767
I'm feeling a little bit
stressed out right now

38:19.800 --> 38:22.500
because we're putting
a lot of time into fishing

38:22.533 --> 38:24.167
and we're
not getting anything.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.667
I'm gonna keep trying.

38:37.333 --> 38:41.167
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate,
have repaired
and moved their fish trap.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.633
But with winter approaching,

38:42.667 --> 38:46.067
they cannot afford another day
without a catch.

38:57.767 --> 38:59.500
Doesn't look good.

38:59.533 --> 39:02.267
-Nothing?
-I don't see anything
in this one, Kate.

39:02.300 --> 39:06.133
-(SCOFFS)
-There's no fish left
in the Yukon, I guess.

39:06.167 --> 39:09.867
Well, this is a waste of time.

39:09.900 --> 39:13.267
Waste of time,
waste of effort,
waste of everything.

39:13.300 --> 39:15.700
-I don't get it.
-I don't get it either.

39:15.733 --> 39:18.067
It should pick up something.

39:19.433 --> 39:22.333
This is the most effort
I've ever put into fishing

39:22.367 --> 39:25.633
with zero results
in my entire life.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.067
It's a tough lesson to learn,
you know, and that's a part

39:28.067 --> 39:30.067
of trying anything
new out here.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.300
Trying to develop
new methods and go for
a different resource,

39:33.333 --> 39:35.067
there's a learning curve.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.767
And right now
my learning curve is kind of
on the negative side.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.633
And I don't really like that.
I'm not a person that really
likes to fail at things.

39:42.667 --> 39:46.167
I don't mind experimenting
and having some
minor failures,

39:46.200 --> 39:49.633
but I don't like it when I try
something and put a
bunch of time into it

39:49.667 --> 39:51.533
and it's a complete
waste of my time.

39:51.567 --> 39:54.333
It looks like probably
what's gonna end up happening
for Kate and I

39:54.367 --> 39:56.267
is fall time's gonna come,

39:56.300 --> 39:58.533
that's gonna be
a really critical moment

39:58.567 --> 40:01.400
for us to make sure
that we get fall chum salmon.

40:01.433 --> 40:05.033
So we're gonna pray that
that run is good
enough for us to fish.

40:05.067 --> 40:09.100
And I think I'm gonna
be hunting moose, and caribou,
and black bears

40:09.133 --> 40:11.133
a whole lot more
'cause it's looking like

40:11.167 --> 40:14.533
we're not gonna have much fish
for the wintertime.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.067
SUE:
Bam! Like that, things change.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.500
If you can't roll with
the punches,

40:23.533 --> 40:25.467
you know, don't get
in the boxing ring then.

40:32.733 --> 40:34.400
PILOT OVER RADIO:
How's it going over there?

40:34.433 --> 40:37.100
Uh, we have fog down
to the ground.

40:37.133 --> 40:39.333
Half to one-mile
visibility right now.

40:39.367 --> 40:41.800
Better to the south
and the east.

40:41.833 --> 40:43.667
Okay, sounds good.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.400
I'll ship you with a load.

40:45.433 --> 40:49.233
NARRATOR: An unusual
summer storm has prevented
Sue's fuel delivery.

40:49.267 --> 40:51.167
With more clients
set to arrive,

40:51.200 --> 40:54.467
getting fuel into camp
is crucial to Sue's business.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.767
Trying to get
the fuel delivery in

40:56.800 --> 41:00.233
and just kept getting boned
by the weather.

41:00.267 --> 41:02.467
But we cleared up,
the ceiling got nice,

41:02.500 --> 41:05.233
they launched and in between
then and now

41:05.267 --> 41:07.633
we've come back down
to the ground in fog.

41:09.633 --> 41:13.067
PILOT:
Okay, be up, uh, right over
your place right now.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.767
I can hear you.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.167
As you go around let me know
what you're thinking
so I can help out.

41:19.300 --> 41:22.267
The plane just radioed in.
He's going overhead now.

41:22.300 --> 41:24.067
He's gonna try to find a hole
to come through.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.400
If not, he'll have to detour

41:26.433 --> 41:28.300
and go to Deadhorse
and wait it out.

41:28.333 --> 41:32.667
PILOT: I think I'm gonna be
coming around and take
a landing to the east.

41:33.633 --> 41:35.700
All right, buddy.

41:35.733 --> 41:37.300
Sounds like he's gonna try it.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.467
Looks like he's smiling.

41:51.933 --> 41:53.200
(ENGINE SHUTTING OFF)

41:54.867 --> 41:57.067
Hey, buddy.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.867
What do we got
on board right now?

41:58.900 --> 42:00.367
-Jet-A. Yeah.
-Jet-A first?

42:00.700 --> 42:02.067
Okay.

42:02.100 --> 42:06.267
You know, this fuel
that I'm getting now is,
it's absolutely key

42:06.300 --> 42:08.667
to me being able
to make my revenue.

42:08.700 --> 42:11.767
This next six weeks is
when I see
the heaviest concentration

42:11.800 --> 42:14.767
of the small planes
coming in and doing
their thing.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.533
So if I'm not able to get
all of the loads I need,

42:17.567 --> 42:20.733
I would not be in the black
and I would not have
a lease any more.

42:20.767 --> 42:22.733
Kavik would be a memory.

42:29.100 --> 42:32.800
Right as the fuel came in,
bam, there's the helicopter
that needs it.

42:32.833 --> 42:37.233
He's gonna use
about 1,500 gallons
in the next three days.

42:37.267 --> 42:39.667
That's half
of what I just got.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.867
You know,
jet fuel delivered,
jet fuel out.

42:41.900 --> 42:44.433
You know, that's,
that's the nature
of the business.

42:44.467 --> 42:46.567
As soon as I get it, man,
they're after it.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.167
So how much is that little pig
gonna drink today
do you think?

42:49.200 --> 42:51.767
-64.1.
-64.1.

42:53.500 --> 42:57.333
Yep, ready to do business,
and then ready for winter.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.433
(SUE CHUCKLES)
