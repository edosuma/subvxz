00:01.043 --> 00:02.078
Who's there?

00:02.253 --> 00:03.709
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.921 --> 00:05.661
It's called frontotemporal dementia.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.297
Areas of your brain start to shrink.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.421
Eight years ago, almost an entire
family died in a car accident.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.128
A young girl named Malia
was never found.

00:14.307 --> 00:17.014
They called him Silverfinger
because of an unusual prosthetic.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.137
- Where did you get that?
- Oft Katashi's dead body.

00:19.312 --> 00:21.974
There's a fox hiding inside a teenage boy.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.013
And I'm going to poison it.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.206
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24.377 --> 01:26.618
Because we wanted to
avoid something like this.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.088
It's only 72 hours.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.958
This is the same place
where Barrow came from.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.259
The guy who had
a tumor inside him filled with flies.

01:32.635 --> 01:34.626
- You don't know everything yet.
- I know enough.

01:34.804 --> 01:38.592
Nogitsunes, kitsunes,
oni, or whatever they're called.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.673
Wow, that was actually
all surprisingly correct.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.594
Scott, I saw an MRI
that looked exactly like my wife's.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.600
And it terrifies me.

01:47.984 --> 01:50.600
I'm headed down
to LA. Tomorrow to talk to a specialist.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.607
- Then why are you putting him in here?
- He's not.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.898
- It was my decision.
- Stiles, I can't help you if you're in here.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.779
And I can't hurt you.

01:58.995 --> 02:02.533
Deaton's got some ideas.
Argent's calling people.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.823
We're gonna find something.
And it we can't...

02:05.042 --> 02:06.953
If you can't...

02:08.170 --> 02:12.334
If you can't, then you have to
do something for me, okay?

02:12.550 --> 02:14.506
Make sure I never get out.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.046
Come on.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.119
Mr. Stilinski?

02:52.882 --> 02:54.338
This way please.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.962
First 72 hours there's no
phone calls, no e-mails, no visitors.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.345
We will be taking you
from here to a brief physical.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.393
In the morning you'll be assessed
by a staff psychologist,

03:07.605 --> 03:10.768
Speak to a social worker
and attend group therapy.

03:13.152 --> 03:15.063
| feel like we're forgetting something.

03:15.738 --> 03:18.821
You will be wearing these, Stiles.
No laces allowed.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.399
You don't have a belt, do you?

03:21.827 --> 03:24.534
And please empty your pockets in here.

03:26.624 --> 03:29.161
Your pillow. Your pillow.
We forgot your pillow.

03:29.335 --> 03:30.745
- Dad, it's okay.
- No, no.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.253
You're never going to be able to fall asleep.
We... We got to go back.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.084
It's fine, Dad. I don't need it.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.169
I can't believe I forgot it.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.585
I mean, every time that
we've ever stayed in a hotel,

03:40.763 --> 03:42.628
the first thing you pack is your pillow.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.510
You can bring it tomorrow.
It's all right.

03:54.652 --> 03:57.018
Okay, you know what?
Stop. Stop. Enough.

03:57.697 --> 03:59.608
Stiles, get your stuff.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.067
I'm not checking you in here

04:01.283 --> 04:03.444
if you're not gonna get
one good night's sleep.

04:03.661 --> 04:04.901
Dad.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.534
I haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.954
Stiles? This way, please.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.166
I'm the part of the bird that's not in the sky.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.257
- Hey, do you see that?
- I'm the part of the bird that's not in the sky.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.960
Stiles, wait for me.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.263
- I'm the part of the bird that's not in the sky.
- That guy up there.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.137
I can swim in the ocean,
yet still remain dry.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.683
I can swim in the ocean,
yet still remain dry.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.812
- Hey! Hey! Stop it!
- I can swim in the ocean, yet still remain dry...

05:15.024 --> 05:16.935
Stop!
Somebody stop him!

06:08.911 --> 06:11.027
- Did you have any trouble with lkeda?
- Only minor.

06:11.247 --> 06:13.454
The white wolf was exactly
where you said it would be.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.917
But we have two problems now.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.127
First, the lichen is not a cure.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.796
It'll wear off in a matter of days.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.422
But while it does work,
the oni won't go after Stiles, right?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.098
lhope.
Eichen House has an unusual history.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.305
It might not be all that safe
for the oni there as well.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.136
What's the second problem?

06:37.356 --> 06:39.221
I checked with your contacts in Japan.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.646
The yakuza boss you saw
killed by the oni never found the scroll.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.402
- What scroll?
- A Shugendo Scroll.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.775
The Shugendo were
the ascetic mystics of Japan.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.487
The scroll had information
on how to exorcise a nogitsune.

06:50.703 --> 06:52.819
- So we need to find that scroll?
- Exactly.

06:52.997 --> 06:55.784
And I did get a name
of the man who last purchased it.

06:55.958 --> 06:56.913
Kincaid.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.330
He was with Katashi. He's the guy
who met with Isaac to buy the gun.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.662
Sounds like Katashi wanted
the scroll for himself.

07:02.882 --> 07:06.466
But Stilinski already told me nothing like it
was found among his things.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.293
And a paranoid like Katashi
would keep it close.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.014
Probably on him at all times.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.842
What does a Shugendo Scroll look like?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.725
Something like this.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.183
Do these come in different sizes?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.276
Any size.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.354
Then I think I know where it might be.

07:29.909 --> 07:33.367
Okay, I know there's the whole 72-hour thing,
but I'd really need to use the phone.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.991
The accident that occurred
is being taken care of.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.413
You're seriously referring
to that as an accident?

07:38.626 --> 07:39.786
Incident.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.709
Slightly better.
Still need to use the phone.

07:42.922 --> 07:46.039
Just five minutes.
Three minutes, please. A three-minute call.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.919
Would you like to go to sleep, Stiles,

07:48.093 --> 07:52.086
or would you like to be introduced
to our five-point restraint system?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.171
I would go with sleep.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.559
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

08:01.523 --> 08:02.854
I'm Oliver.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.727
Stiles.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.525
There was a suicide, huh?

08:07.071 --> 08:08.277
Yeah.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.025
Is it Monday?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.447
There's a much higher rate
of suicide on Mondays.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.610
Okay then.
Um, hey, can someone...

08:16.830 --> 08:19.287
Someone just please let me out of here.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.115
Someone. Anyone.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.451
I heard it by the way.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.995
It happened in the stairwell, right?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.047
Yeah. How'd you know that?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.795
I heard the echo.

08:32.096 --> 08:34.462
- What do you mean?
- It's this place.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.839
Something about the way
that it was built.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.304
Everything echoes.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.805
Eventually.

08:41.271 --> 08:44.229
That's why they call it

08:45.317 --> 08:46.932
Echo House.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.452
Have you been awake all night?

09:06.630 --> 09:09.167
Yeah, I can't sleep without my pillow.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.167
You okay?

09:14.388 --> 09:16.299
I swallowed a bug the other day.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.426
You ever do that?

09:18.642 --> 09:20.473
I keep coughing.
Like it's still in my throat.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.677
That's disgusting, Oliver.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.512
You don't have any idea
when they unlock the doors, do you?

09:28.110 --> 09:29.350
Now.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.229
Most of the people here are okay.
The violent ones are in the closed unit.

09:33.449 --> 09:35.940
That's Hillary. She has OCD.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.530
That's Gary.
He thinks he's Jesus Christ.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.073
Dan. Also Jesus.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.823
- That's Mary...
- Mary Magdalene?

09:44.043 --> 09:45.658
No, she also thinks she's Jesus.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.290
You'd be surprised how
many Jesuses we get.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.881
Not really.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.672
Hey, how come you want
to use the phone already?

09:52.885 --> 09:54.546
'Cause after one night,
I've changed my mind

09:54.762 --> 09:56.878
about this place being safe for me.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.303
Or anyone. Ever.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.052
No. No, I think you're wrong.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.802
I really think I should tell them.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.809
They're going to want to know the story.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.349
The whole story.

10:11.403 --> 10:15.942
I really think they should know.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.448
Yes, I do.

10:19.495 --> 10:23.204
One of them is standing right behind me.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.123
Who was that?

10:36.678 --> 10:39.590
That's Meredith.
She's a little weird.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.555
You're a little weird.
She's a lot weird.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.600
It's dead.

10:49.817 --> 10:50.772
Yeah.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.938
They turn off all the phones
for 24 hours after a suicide.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.025
Why didn't you tell me that before?

10:57.241 --> 10:58.447
Why didn't you ask?

11:01.662 --> 11:04.278
- What are you going to do now?
- I'm getting out of this nuthouse.

11:04.498 --> 11:08.207
That's not really the appropriate way
to describe a facility like this.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.292
Malia?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.131
Hey. It's Stiles.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.135
Do you remember me?
I'm friends with Scott.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.087
Remember. We were the ones
who helped you out with...

11:23.517 --> 11:25.257
Hey, Malia!

11:25.727 --> 11:28.264
- No!
- Hey, what the hell? She hit me.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.605
A few more like this, Malia,
and you're headed to the closed unit.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.808
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. I didn't do anything.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.187
Back off!

11:35.404 --> 11:36.359
Stop!

11:47.958 --> 11:49.448
Enough!

11:51.211 --> 11:52.417
Enough.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.467
Stiles.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.551
You saw something, didn't you?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.469
That basement.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.475
I've been down there before.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.699
Still nothing?

12:29.499 --> 12:30.909
- Derek?
- Hold on.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.503
- Hey, where's the sheriff?
- Stilinski's out for the day.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.047
So the Katashi murder is now
a federal investigation.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.796
Everything here that wasn't blown up
needs to be placed in lockup.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.467
You were right.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.348
They're moving all the evidence.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.642
Was there anything about the murder itself?

12:50.854 --> 12:52.014
Any other details?

12:52.231 --> 12:54.563
Just about putting Katashi's things
in a federal lockup

12:54.775 --> 12:57.983
and something about Stilinski
being out for the day.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.443
You know, if all of this is true,

13:01.156 --> 13:02.737
people are dead because of Stiles.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.565
But is it really Stiles?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.155
Remember, we've had this problem before.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.069
But we got lucky with Jackson.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.616
What happens when you don't get lucky?

13:14.836 --> 13:18.044
I guess it depends on how much
or how little of Stiles is left.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.791
- You ever heard of the berserkers?
- Germanic warriors.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.047
They wore the skins of bears
to channel their ferocity.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.346
They didn't just wear them.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.967
They became them.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.891
You know, a couple of years ago,
a family came to us for help with their son.

13:35.357 --> 13:36.517
This group of teenagers,

13:36.692 --> 13:39.559
they were doing all sorts of
rituals with animal skins.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.693
Somehow they tapped into it.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.278
But with berserkers,
the human side doesn't last long.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.856
They're not tempered by the moon.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.608
He killed people?

13:48.203 --> 13:49.739
He tore them apart.

13:50.914 --> 13:54.281
Eventually, I had to tell the family
their son was gone.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.459
It took three of us to take him down.
Almost every bullet we had.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.499
And when it was over,

14:00.757 --> 14:02.622
I felt no remorse. None.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.876
I knew that kid was long gone.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.714
Would you feel any remorse
putting Stiles down?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.802
Stiles? Yes.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.102
But not a nogitsune.

14:16.523 --> 14:20.266
I want to go back
to the topic of guilt today.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.856
It might surprise you to hear me say
that guilt is a good thing.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.445
It's a rather mature emotion.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.864
Malia, you said something
about guilt the other day.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.406
You said it came with a visceral reaction.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.451
I said it made me feel sick to my stomach.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.379
Guilt often becomes physical.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.009
You feel it in your gut.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.586
It's not just psychological.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.968
How does guilt make you feel, Stiles?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.137
- I'm sorry, what?
- Guilt.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.811
- What does it make you feel?
- Nervous.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.850
Like a sense of urgency?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.729
You feel an urgent need
to make up for something you've done.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.983
To apologize.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.120
These are healthy responses.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.666
Does anyone know what we call someone
who doesn't experience guilt?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.168
Sociopath.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.413
That's right, Oliver.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.759
I'm sorry, everyone,
but we need to take a break.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.842
Come with me, Stiles.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.140
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.559
It's called a Lichtenberg figure.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.391
They appear on lightning strike victims.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.567
The fact that they're appearing on you
after a shot of wolf lichen is both

15:49.783 --> 15:51.648
significant and strange.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.905
By significant and strange
do you mean hopeful and optimistic?

15:55.080 --> 15:59.494
When the marks fade,
the nogitsune's grip over you will return.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.372
- What are these? Sleeping pills?
- Amphetamines.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.212
Sleeping is exactly
what you don't want to do.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.134
You're vulnerable when you're asleep.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.137
- So all I have to do is stay awake?
- For now.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.349
- I'll come find you.
- To tell me what to do?

16:21.523 --> 16:23.229
No, to give you an injection.

16:23.442 --> 16:25.057
Pancuronium bromide.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.441
It causes respiratory paralysis.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.269
That sounds a lot like death.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.525
It's used for lethal injection, yes.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.778
So when the nogitsune takes over,
you're going to kill me?

16:34.995 --> 16:39.284
I'm going to do what I've always done.
Maintain the balance.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.699
Okay then. I've missed our talks.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.454
Thanks for the illicit drugs.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.126
Stiles.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.372
Stay awake.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.574
What are you doing?

17:25.670 --> 17:26.921
I need to get through here.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.461
To the basement.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.925
Doctors don't even have a key to this door.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.250
Only Brunski.

17:34.763 --> 17:38.096
- Is that the head orderly?
- He's got keys to everything in here.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.553
Does he keep them on him all the time?

17:40.769 --> 17:42.430
If you want them,

17:42.604 --> 17:45.471
you'll probably have to
figure out a way to trick him.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.767
Well, part of me is getting
very good at playing tricks.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.567
My father said all
of the Katashi evidence is being moved

17:55.784 --> 17:57.320
to a federal lockup by armored car tonight.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.322
Probably within the next few hours.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.083
We're going to rob an armored car?

18:04.292 --> 18:07.375
Well, we're going to try.

18:19.641 --> 18:20.721
Okay.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.845
Okay, just got to stay awake, Stiles.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.801
You just gotta stay...

18:28.316 --> 18:29.692
Don't worry, Stiles,

18:29.901 --> 18:32.062
you didn't just accidentally
walk into the girls' room.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.894
Thank God.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.605
Um...

18:37.117 --> 18:39.108
Okay, so what are you doing
in the boys' room?

18:39.327 --> 18:40.282
Showering.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.282
I can see that. I mean, I saw that.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.363
Well, actually, I didn't
see anything really. Ijust...

18:45.584 --> 18:47.290
There was too much steam to, uh...

18:47.502 --> 18:49.743
Not that I would prefer
there to be less steam...

18:49.963 --> 18:51.749
Stiles, I don't care.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.461
In the woods,
there was no boys' and girls' room.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.758
And if you really need to know,

18:57.971 --> 19:00.303
they keep the water temperature
in the girls' room too low.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.846
It's much hotter in here.

19:02.058 --> 19:06.017
Ever since I turned back to human,
I just can't seem to get warm.

19:06.521 --> 19:10.389
Maybe you just have a low core temp.
You know, you mightjust be sick or...

19:10.609 --> 19:13.692
- I used to have a fur coat.
- Or, it could be... Hey, it might be that.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.484
It's probably that.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.615
Now you're staring.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.408
No, I'm not.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.077
Then what are you doing?

19:27.417 --> 19:28.497
Uh...

19:28.710 --> 19:31.747
I was kind of wondering
why you punched me.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.288
Did you think I was going to thank you?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.463
No. Maybe.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.592
We did kind of save your life.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.674
You're right, Stiles. Thank you.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.802
Thanks for invading my home.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.850
For putting me on the run.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.432
For turning me back to human

19:50.649 --> 19:52.856
so that I could look at my father every day

19:53.068 --> 19:55.275
and try to figure out how to explain to him

19:55.487 --> 19:56.852
that the reason my sister
and mother are dead

19:57.030 --> 20:00.443
is because I almost ate them on a full moon.
Thank you so very much.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.283
We were just trying to help.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.827
You want to help me?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.620
Find a way to change me back.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.458
You want to go back?
To being a coyote?

20:14.381 --> 20:15.837
What do you know?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.210
I might know somebody
who could teach you how to change.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.383
Okay. What do you want?

20:20.595 --> 20:23.302
I need to get into the basement.
Which means that I need to get the keys off

20:23.515 --> 20:25.255
- of that orderly, the big one.
- Brunski.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.845
You help me,
and I'll help you.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.306
This is a really bad plan.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.138
It's not that bad.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.438
It's not that good.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.066
None of us knows the route
they're going to take.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.360
If Allison can get one
of her dad's GPS trackers

20:39.572 --> 20:41.779
on the armored car,
then we can follow it.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.947
- So when it gets here...
- We attack them?

20:45.078 --> 20:46.067
No.

20:46.496 --> 20:49.829
Your bikes will be in the middle of the road,
looking like you guys got into an accident.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.206
And when the driver gets out to help...

20:52.419 --> 20:54.205
- We attack him?
- No.

20:54.546 --> 20:58.459
You'll distract him
and Scott will break open the back door.

20:59.509 --> 21:00.498
lhope.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.921
And you'll get Katashi's finger.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.753
It's not his actual finger, is it?

21:06.224 --> 21:07.464
You are so out of our league.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.557
Why aren't we just going
to Stilinski for help?

21:09.769 --> 21:10.929
Because if he gets caught,

21:11.104 --> 21:13.436
then it's the Sheriff
tampering with federal evidence.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.642
Guys, this is going to work.
We can do this.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.979
We're losing Stiles.
My dad's in jail for murder.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.648
We need to do this.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.232
You're lying, you're a liar!

21:26.494 --> 21:27.529
What the hell's going on?

21:27.829 --> 21:30.115
- You're lying!
- Get this nut-job off of me!

21:30.290 --> 21:32.281
No! She said that they
drill holes in your head.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.456
She said they're gonna
put a hole in my head!

21:46.014 --> 21:47.379
No! Please, come on! Please, don't...

21:47.599 --> 21:49.055
Please don't put a hole in my head.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.803
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.103
They told me my lawyer was here.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.403
So either I'm going to congratulate you
on recently passing the bar

22:08.411 --> 22:10.197
or I should be worried about something.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.247
Hello, Christoph.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.338
Come on.

22:31.768 --> 22:32.928
Come on.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.393
I thought this guy had a key to everything.

22:37.023 --> 22:37.978
I do.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.607
But nobody has the key to that room.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.324
Into the Quiet Room, little man.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.407
Want to tell us where you got these?

22:54.624 --> 22:55.909
A vending machine.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.710
I always love the sarcastic ones.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.838
Give him five of the Haldol.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.211
Wait. What's that? Is that a sedative?

23:06.469 --> 23:08.334
Okay, hang on. Hang on!
I can't go to sleep.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.591
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...

23:11.015 --> 23:12.266
Get off me, man!

23:17.230 --> 23:18.686
I can't go to sleep...

23:19.941 --> 23:21.431
You don't understand.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.027
You don't get it.
I gotta stay awake.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.439
I gotta stay...

23:32.078 --> 23:33.739
I have to stay awake.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.085
What are you doing here?

23:47.802 --> 23:49.133
I want to help.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.134
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.509
Because of my mother?

23:54.726 --> 23:57.217
No. I know that's not your fault.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.140
Yeah, but it still feels like it is.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.262
And if I can help, shouldn't I?

24:01.482 --> 24:05.066
People who help us
usually end up getting hurt. Badly.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.686
Okay, but I've been practicing.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.021
Practicing what?

24:09.324 --> 24:11.565
I've been picking this up really fast.
Like crazy fast.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.031
You sure about that?

24:16.372 --> 24:18.704
Sorry. Watch.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.209
Okay. You're coming.

24:40.563 --> 24:41.848
No, no.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.012
Hey.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.765
Hey!

24:46.319 --> 24:48.230
Hey. Hey, let me out!

24:48.446 --> 24:49.435
Let me out!

24:49.656 --> 24:51.271
Let me out!

24:56.996 --> 24:58.532
Let me in.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.242
What... What do you mean?

25:04.796 --> 25:06.457
You know.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.503
Okay, screw you and your stupid riddles.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.805
No riddle this time, Stiles.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.133
You know what it means.

25:21.813 --> 25:23.678
Let me out.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.984
Just let me out.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.816
Let me out.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.233
Just let me out!

25:31.030 --> 25:33.442
Let me in!

25:33.741 --> 25:35.447
No, no, no. Shh!

25:35.743 --> 25:38.029
Hey, hey, hey. Shh!

25:38.830 --> 25:40.240
Shut up.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.128
How did you get in here?

25:46.504 --> 25:49.667
I broke the lock.
If I concentrate I can be pretty strong.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.338
Get up.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.296
There's another way to the basement.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.135
Through the closed unit.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.342
Where they keep the real psychos.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.096
You're up.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.205
Okay, let's get out of here.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.178
We have to do something.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.643
Who the hell is that?

26:47.398 --> 26:48.433
Kincaid.

26:49.442 --> 26:50.978
You want to talk about the code?

26:51.152 --> 26:53.734
Ours is more than a code of behavior.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.103
It's a code of honor.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.114
These things bind our families.

26:59.327 --> 27:02.535
You don't abandon such things lightly.

27:02.830 --> 27:06.118
Where in the code does it say my wife
had to kill herself?

27:06.334 --> 27:08.871
Your wife honored us with her dying breath.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.453
She would have honored
her daughter by living.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.711
Your family is very complicated, though.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.467
Isn't it?

27:20.932 --> 27:23.218
What do you really want to know?

27:25.228 --> 27:27.219
Is this about Allison?

27:28.106 --> 27:29.346
What are you fishing for?

27:30.942 --> 27:32.807
I don't fish, "mijo."

27:35.738 --> 27:36.944
lhunt

27:43.496 --> 27:45.032
We need that finger.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.288
Why should I give it to you?

27:52.505 --> 27:55.463
There's a briefcase
in there with $150,000 in it.

27:56.801 --> 28:00.965
The scroll inside this prosthetic finger
is worth three million.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.092
Give me the finger.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.140
You know what I mean.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.321
I guess negotiations are over.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.467
Do you know what you're looking for?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.632
Something to do with that.

28:57.486 --> 28:58.646
What does it mean?

28:59.488 --> 29:00.614
Self.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.697
Maybe you should tell me more.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.697
You might not like me
if you know any more.

29:09.498 --> 29:13.241
Try to remember that I'm a werecoyote
who murdered her own family.

29:14.212 --> 29:16.203
I won'tjudge. I promise.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.619
You have the eyes of an Alpha.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.374
But where's the strength?

29:59.590 --> 30:00.830
Up here.

30:24.949 --> 30:27.281
This place definitely
used to be a lot more fun.

30:27.493 --> 30:31.111
Electroshock, ice baths.
Trepanation?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.614
That's what Oliver was talking about.

30:35.084 --> 30:37.826
Trepanation is when they
drill into your head.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.331
No wonder they don't
want anyone down here.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.332
There's nothing here.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.755
Could you do me a favor?
Could you just check the lines on my back?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.760
Just tell me if they're fading.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.678
Yeah, they're almost gone.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.557
I'm guessing that's bad.

31:00.568 --> 31:04.026
- Oh.
- Sorry. I told you I'm always cold.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.108
That's okay.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.063
Here.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.453
Wow, you really are.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.110
Was that your first kiss?

31:51.285 --> 31:52.741
Was it okay?

31:57.291 --> 31:58.952
You want to try it again?

32:19.355 --> 32:21.437
I want to try something else.

32:22.483 --> 32:24.895
- Something else?
- Yeah.

33:17.455 --> 33:18.535
Stop!

33:18.747 --> 33:20.703
- Ethan, Aiden...
- Stop!

33:21.959 --> 33:23.790
You want him to come after us?

33:24.503 --> 33:28.087
Scott, we've seen guys like this.
Trust us. He's dangerous.

33:28.299 --> 33:29.664
So are we.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.750
And he looks smart enough
to remember that.

33:44.523 --> 33:48.061
We're here to save a life. Not end one.

34:10.132 --> 34:11.292
Stiles.

34:26.857 --> 34:28.313
Do you hear that?

35:08.190 --> 35:09.305
This is him.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.437
The nogitsune?

35:33.048 --> 35:34.458
Recognize them?

35:39.388 --> 35:40.969
One of them.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.598
I have to get this to Scott.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.564
You took Brunski's keys.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.730
I took his stun gun.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.695
I also got his Haldol.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.541
Like I was saying, Stiles,

36:20.512 --> 36:22.673
I heard they used to do trepanation here.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.509
Oliver...

36:25.351 --> 36:26.591
What are you doing?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.609
I'm going to let the evil spirits out.

36:55.881 --> 36:59.248
I borrowed a few pointers
from the five-point restraint.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.930
Oliver, stop this.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.822
Oliver, listen to me. Stop!

37:24.493 --> 37:25.448
Oliver!

37:27.788 --> 37:28.948
Oliver! Stop!

37:29.832 --> 37:31.572
Start with her.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.472
You did this.

37:50.686 --> 37:52.051
You got into his head.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.222
Every Dracula needs a Renfield.

38:02.489 --> 38:03.990
Just let her go.

38:05.325 --> 38:06.906
Let me in.

38:11.874 --> 38:13.739
Stiles.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.919
Do you want her to leave here alive?

38:19.965 --> 38:22.206
Do you want us to leave?

38:23.010 --> 38:26.628
We can walk out of this place.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.339
Just let her go please.

38:40.486 --> 38:41.896
Let me in.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.982
Let me in, Stiles!

38:48.202 --> 38:50.238
Let me in!

38:51.038 --> 38:52.824
Just let her go please!

38:53.624 --> 38:56.115
Let me in, Stiles!

38:56.710 --> 38:59.247
Let me in!

39:00.088 --> 39:03.330
Let me in and I'll let her live.

39:04.927 --> 39:08.260
Let me in!

39:18.065 --> 39:19.271
Oliver.

39:57.521 --> 39:58.852
Stiles?

40:13.495 --> 40:15.577
There isn't much here, unfortunately.

40:16.290 --> 40:17.826
Does it say anything?

40:18.876 --> 40:20.582
My Japanese isn't great.

40:21.211 --> 40:24.419
But it appears to say that
one method of expelling a nogitsune

40:24.631 --> 40:26.292
is to change the body of the host.

40:26.508 --> 40:28.169
Change the body?

40:28.927 --> 40:30.588
Which begs the question,

40:31.722 --> 40:33.713
how do we change Stiles's body?

40:36.727 --> 40:38.592
By turning him into a werewolf.

40:40.647 --> 40:43.354
- Do you know where you're going?
- No, but I know who I'm looking for.

40:43.567 --> 40:44.852
Scott McCall.

40:46.820 --> 40:47.855
You know him?

40:49.031 --> 40:50.862
I can tell you where to find him.
