Whoa, whoa--hold on.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.497
What floor?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.099
16.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.473
Gonna be a nice one today.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.542
yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.411
Man, you don't look so good.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.913
Are you okay?

01:08.602 --> 01:11.337
Hey, linda, I think something's
wrong with that guy.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.240
Sir, you have to sign in.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.687

02:39.192 --> 02:40.459
May I help you?

02:40.527 --> 02:42.795
Yes, uh, I'm looking for someone who seems

02:42.862 --> 02:44.296
To have gotten lost.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.231
Okay, what school is he from?

02:46.299 --> 02:48.067
He's not from any school. He's a man.

02:48.134 --> 02:49.535
His name is dr. Walter bishop.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.636
Hmm, I see.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.971
A special needs individual.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.473
Heh, you have no idea.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.342
<i>When the victoria,</i>

02:56.409 --> 02:58.844
The last surviving ship,

02:58.912 --> 03:01.981
Returned to its harbor of departure

03:02.048 --> 03:05.351
After the first
circumnavigation of the earth,

03:05.418 --> 03:10.255
Only 18 of the original
237 men were on board.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.457
What happened to them?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.025
They all died, young lady.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.228
<i>Horrible and most likely
painful deaths.</i>

03:16.296 --> 03:19.665
You see, when you open new doors,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.600
There is a price to pay.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.035
<i>Now imagine...</i>

03:23.103 --> 03:27.006
Tonight, you look under your bed,

03:27.073 --> 03:28.407
And, lo and behold,

03:28.475 --> 03:29.708
You find a monster!

03:29.776 --> 03:31.343
<i>And you're immediately eaten.</i>

03:31.411 --> 03:32.711
<i>Now, if you hadn't</i>

03:32.779 --> 03:34.480
Looked for the monster,

03:34.547 --> 03:35.714
You wouldn't have found it,

03:35.782 --> 03:37.783
<i>And you'd still be happy
in your beds,</i>

03:37.851 --> 03:39.618
Instead of being slowly digested

03:39.686 --> 03:41.387
In the stomach sack of the creature.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.656
<i>But, with any luck,</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:45.357
Your sisters or your brothers

03:45.425 --> 03:47.059
Might have heard your screams,

03:47.127 --> 03:48.727
And your endeavor will serve

03:48.795 --> 03:50.863
As a valuable lesson for them.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.464
Excuse me, do you work here?

03:52.532 --> 03:56.001
No, I'm a-- a season pass holder.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.904
But thank you. Dr. Walter bishop.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.106
They had no right to revoke my membership.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.174
No right.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.842
Walter, you terrified those kids.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.311
These children should know the truth.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.746
Hello. Agent dunham?

04:07.814 --> 04:10.582
They're tragically coddled and ill-advised.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.851
Have you already told peter?

04:12.919 --> 04:16.654
Okay...We'll be there right away.

04:16.723 --> 04:17.690
Come on.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.833
Detective, I'm agent dunham.

04:27.901 --> 04:28.867
This is peter bishop.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.902
Detective kassel.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.103
We've been taking witness statements,

04:31.171 --> 04:33.939
<i>Trying to figure out what went down.</i>

04:34.007 --> 04:35.107
Is the m.E. Here yet?

04:35.175 --> 04:37.076
On his way.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.278
It's a dutch license.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.316
Radjan vandenkemp.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.354
I've never seen anything like this.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.923
Lucky you.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.358
I'm gonna talk to some of the witnesses.

04:53.426 --> 04:57.129
I'm agent dunham with the f.B.I. Hi.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.197
I'll let you two talk.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.665
Thank you.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.568
Uh...Did he have an
appointment here at vitas?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.503
Mm-mm. No one knew him.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.305
No one was expecting him.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.407
I don't even think he knew
where he was going himself.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.109
<i>He got off the elevator,</i>

05:10.176 --> 05:11.643
<i>Seemed confused, and then collapsed.</i>

05:11.711 --> 05:13.278
Okay, thanks.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.547
It's broyles. He's downstairs.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.449
He's gonna run vandenkemp and
see what he can come up with.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.618
Well, see, he didn't know anybody here,

05:19.686 --> 05:20.853
And this doesn't seem
like the kind of business

05:20.920 --> 05:22.454
That you just walk into.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.990
Excuse me. Can I ask a question?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.391
Sure, mr...

05:26.459 --> 05:27.760
Uh, ames. Vincent ames.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.828
I'm the vp of geotechnical engineering.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.663
Will we be able to leave soon?

05:31.731 --> 05:34.633
Not yet, I'm afraid.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.934
<i>do we know what happened to him yet?</i>

05:36.002 --> 05:37.503
That's what we're trying to figure out.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.738
But we'll let you know
as soon as you can leave.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.610
Mike, the courier rode up with him.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.678
Which one's mike?

05:46.746 --> 05:49.014
He's sitting right over here.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.736
Dr. Bishop, agent farnsworth.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.805
Got a deceased male, age 50.

06:12.872 --> 06:13.906
We believe he's from the netherlands.

06:13.973 --> 06:16.441
Walked into vitas petrol at 7:
30 this morning,

06:16.509 --> 06:17.543
And his veins ruptured.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.311
Oh! Oh, I see.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.713
Well, uh, vasculitis could be a cause.

06:21.781 --> 06:25.117
Or, uh, an arteriovenous fistula,

06:25.185 --> 06:28.220
Which is an abnormal channel
between the vessels.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.155
Extremely high blood pressure results,

06:30.223 --> 06:31.957
Resulting in swelling of the veins.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.525
<i>until they rupture? no,
no, not usually.</i>

06:33.593 --> 06:36.094
But then, that's why we're here, I imagine.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.399
Don't, no, don't!

06:50.376 --> 06:53.011
This building must be
quarantined immediately.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.580
No one goes in or out.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.749
<i>I believe we have a contagion on our
hands.</i>

06:57.817 --> 06:59.484
But olivia and peter--

06:59.552 --> 07:01.086
<i>They'll be trapped inside.</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:09.494
Quarantine the building, agent broyles.

07:17.958 --> 07:20.492
I need to find out more about
the first victim, peter.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.260
The dutchman.

07:22.328 --> 07:24.596
<i>If I can find out where he came from,</i>

07:24.664 --> 07:25.864
<i>Where he was,</i>

07:25.932 --> 07:27.566
<i>Then I could begin to ascertain</i>

07:27.633 --> 07:28.767
<i>What could have infected him.</i>

07:28.835 --> 07:30.001
Walter, we don't know yet.

07:30.069 --> 07:31.236
Well, who was he coming to see?

07:31.304 --> 07:33.772
Someone up there must know him.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.040
Know something.

07:36.642 --> 07:38.410
Walter?

07:43.182 --> 07:44.783
The cdc is here.

07:44.851 --> 07:46.785
<i>You be careful up there, son.</i>

07:46.853 --> 07:49.254
I will.

07:49.322 --> 07:51.890
The cdc is here.

07:51.958 --> 07:54.459
Walter, it's gonna be okay.

07:56.629 --> 07:58.463
We should get to work.

08:05.071 --> 08:06.404
<i>Why are the police holding us here?</i>

08:06.472 --> 08:09.107
We think we're in the midst
of a virus contamination.

08:09.175 --> 08:11.443
<i>The centers for disease
control are here.</i>

08:11.511 --> 08:12.611
Are you saying we're quarantined?

08:12.678 --> 08:13.845
For now, yes.

08:13.913 --> 08:15.247
What happened to mike?

08:15.314 --> 08:16.848
He was infected.

08:16.916 --> 08:18.917
Is he...Dead?

08:23.022 --> 08:24.322
He was closest to him.
He was right over the guy.

08:24.390 --> 08:25.457
<i>You were there too, carl.</i>

08:25.525 --> 08:26.658
You were there next to the courier.

08:26.726 --> 08:27.726
<i>And devon and vincent.</i>

08:27.794 --> 08:29.494
<i>You all got his blood on you.</i>

08:29.562 --> 08:30.662
Then why aren't they sick too?

08:30.730 --> 08:31.730
How do you explain that?

08:31.798 --> 08:33.030
I don't know, elaine.

08:33.099 --> 08:34.698
But I'm sure it's just a matter of time.

08:37.669 --> 08:39.304
They shut down the airflow.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.773
I asked detective castle to take care of it.

08:41.841 --> 08:44.042
His protocol... In case
the virus is airborne.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.677
We don't want it to spread
through the building.

08:45.745 --> 08:48.346
So I'm gonna need to
separate you into groups.

08:48.414 --> 08:50.348
Those who were near vandenkemp,

08:50.416 --> 08:52.984
If you could gather in
one of the boardrooms.

08:53.052 --> 08:55.187
It's just a precaution
until we know what this is

08:55.254 --> 08:58.356
And how it's being spread.

08:58.424 --> 08:59.424
Come on, let's go!

09:01.761 --> 09:04.563
Agent broyles, arnold mcfadden,

09:04.630 --> 09:06.565
Field director, cdc.

09:06.632 --> 09:08.733
I understand you've got two people up there.

09:08.801 --> 09:10.535
Do we know yet whether this is the result

09:10.603 --> 09:11.970
Of a bioterrorism event?

09:12.038 --> 09:13.672
We're looking into that
possibility as we speak,

09:13.739 --> 09:14.673
But nothing yet.

09:14.740 --> 09:17.209
<i>You wanted me?</i>

09:17.276 --> 09:18.410
Let's get a team into the lobby.

09:18.477 --> 09:19.711
Get blood work on your way.

09:19.779 --> 09:22.214
Cut a two-block radius with barriers.

09:33.526 --> 09:36.328
I will need at least half
a dozen of those samples,

09:36.395 --> 09:37.429
Young man.

09:37.496 --> 09:39.030
Excuse me, who are you?

09:39.098 --> 09:42.067
Take me to your centrifuge.

09:43.736 --> 09:46.571
Excuse me.

09:46.639 --> 09:50.308
Agent broyles, uh, walter has been arrested.

09:52.311 --> 09:53.879
<i>Agent broyles, thank god you're here.</i>

09:53.946 --> 09:56.014
Please tell these men to release me.

09:56.082 --> 09:57.148
<i>He breached the security line.</i>

09:57.216 --> 09:58.350
Claims he's f.B.I.,

09:58.417 --> 09:59.551
But he's got no credentials
or identification.

09:59.619 --> 10:01.386
I said I was a consultant.

10:01.454 --> 10:03.455
Dr. Bishop works with us.

10:03.522 --> 10:05.757
His son peter's inside the building.

10:05.825 --> 10:07.158
I need to get back to the lab.

10:07.226 --> 10:09.895
I'm trying to determine what
pathogen I'm dealing with.

10:09.962 --> 10:11.863
And I need a blood sampl
e- something to work with.

10:11.931 --> 10:14.399
I can understand your
wanting to assist, doctor.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.768
But I have a great deal of
experience with pathogens.

10:16.836 --> 10:20.405
And I was chairman of
biochemistry at harvard

10:20.473 --> 10:22.941
And have little patience.
For small-minded bureaucrats.

10:23.009 --> 10:26.011
Walter...

10:26.078 --> 10:29.080
That's not helping.

10:31.584 --> 10:33.285
I-I'm sorry.

10:33.352 --> 10:36.321
We need more information.

10:36.389 --> 10:39.791
My son tells me that several
people got blood on them

10:39.859 --> 10:41.226
From the infected man.

10:41.294 --> 10:43.028
But only one of them died. Why him?

10:43.095 --> 10:45.363
Why aren't the others showing symptoms?

10:45.431 --> 10:48.867
I must get back to my lab and find out.

10:48.935 --> 10:51.903
<i>No matter what your impressions are of dr.
Bishop,</i>

10:51.971 --> 10:54.439
I assure you he's a valuable asset.

10:58.044 --> 11:01.246
Hubert, you will escort dr.
Bishop to his lab

11:01.314 --> 11:03.214
With samples that you will
not let out of your sight.

11:03.282 --> 11:05.684
Thank you. Thank you.

11:05.751 --> 11:08.486
Quickly, get your pajamas off and--

11:08.554 --> 11:09.487
Come on, let's go!

11:09.555 --> 11:11.423
<i>Come on.</i>

11:11.490 --> 11:12.791
<i>Come on.</i>

11:16.963 --> 11:18.763
You know, I can't find the name vandenkemp

11:18.831 --> 11:20.832
Anywhere in this database.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.134
But he must have been here to see somebody.

11:23.202 --> 11:24.269
<i>How far back did you go?</i>

11:24.337 --> 11:25.503
<i>Two months.</i>

11:31.911 --> 11:35.280
They're all calling their families.

11:35.348 --> 11:37.549
Wanna call your sister?

11:37.616 --> 11:39.818
Just to let her know what's going on?

11:42.722 --> 11:45.056
What do you make of this?

11:45.124 --> 11:46.725
<i>This guy, ames,</i>

11:46.792 --> 11:47.826
<i>He had two appointments this morning,</i>

11:47.893 --> 11:48.827
<i>But he cleared his calendar</i>

11:48.894 --> 11:50.261
Last minute yesterday.

11:50.329 --> 11:51.363
But he's here.

11:52.898 --> 11:54.933
That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

11:55.001 --> 11:58.937
And it doesn't necessarily
not mean anything, either.

11:59.005 --> 12:01.773
Guys...

12:01.841 --> 12:03.375
We have a problem.

12:13.185 --> 12:15.653
what's happening to me?

12:19.225 --> 12:21.026
Come on in here.

12:23.696 --> 12:25.063
<i>I want you to lay down</i>

12:25.131 --> 12:27.766
And just try and rest and
relax as best you can, okay?

12:27.833 --> 12:29.601
Okay, I'm gonna get you some water.

12:29.668 --> 12:31.102
Thank you.

12:33.172 --> 12:35.073
Thank you.

12:35.141 --> 12:36.674
Be right back.

12:41.147 --> 12:42.947
So how much time do you think she has?

12:43.015 --> 12:45.383
I don't know, the courier died...

12:45.451 --> 12:48.253
Maybe half hour after giving vandenkemp cpr.

12:52.491 --> 12:53.725
She's sick?

12:53.793 --> 12:55.026
I'm afraid so.

12:55.094 --> 12:56.661
But she didn't get any of the blood on her.

12:56.729 --> 12:58.163
You don't know that for sure.

12:58.230 --> 12:59.664
She didn't; she was nowhere
near him when he died!

12:59.732 --> 13:01.266
which means we could all have it.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.634
But we don't know that.

13:02.701 --> 13:04.169
She was friends with the courier, right?

13:04.236 --> 13:05.670
Maybe he touched her.
He could have infected her.

13:05.738 --> 13:08.573
<i>The fact is, we just don't know.</i>

13:08.641 --> 13:10.575
<i>But it's important that
we all stay calm.</i>

13:10.643 --> 13:12.477
Can I talk to you in private, mr. Ames?

13:15.047 --> 13:18.316
Okay, I know mr.
Vandenkemp was here to see you.

13:18.384 --> 13:20.018
Your schedule was rearranged yesterday

13:20.086 --> 13:22.020
And your morning was cleared out.

13:22.088 --> 13:23.621
<i>Why was he here?</i>

13:27.726 --> 13:29.694
He came here to sell me some information

13:29.762 --> 13:31.229
From one of our competitors.

13:31.297 --> 13:32.730
What kind of information?

13:32.798 --> 13:35.366
All he said was it was
from a recent reserve find.

13:35.434 --> 13:36.501
Well, it's possible that vandenkemp

13:36.569 --> 13:37.902
Came in contact with the virus there,

13:37.970 --> 13:39.504
So do you know which oil reserve?

13:39.572 --> 13:40.972
Which competitor was it?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.173
He wouldn't say.

13:42.241 --> 13:44.042
All he said was,

13:44.110 --> 13:45.510
"I have something to show you."

13:45.578 --> 13:48.613
Something I would find very valuable.

13:48.681 --> 13:50.315
He was supposed to be gone

13:50.382 --> 13:52.417
Before the staff came in this morning.

13:52.485 --> 13:54.285
Well, where is it,

13:54.353 --> 13:55.453
The information?

13:55.521 --> 13:56.521
I don't know.

13:56.589 --> 13:59.524
He didn't have anything with him.

13:59.592 --> 14:01.960
It's a very competitive business,
agent dunham.

14:02.027 --> 14:03.761
I know what I did breaks
a dozen federal laws,

14:03.829 --> 14:05.597
But I'd rather go to prison than die here.

14:05.664 --> 14:08.266
Well, it may be too late to
trade one for the other now,

14:08.334 --> 14:09.501
Mr. Ames.

14:21.340 --> 14:22.674
Radjan vandenkemp was an oil consultant.

14:23.192 --> 14:25.093
He arrived at logan three days
ago on a flight from dubai.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.095
We've already contacted 174

14:27.162 --> 14:29.063
Of the 212 passengers on board.

14:29.131 --> 14:30.598
No one's shown any signs of infection.

14:30.666 --> 14:32.667
Were you able to track his movements?

14:32.735 --> 14:33.868
He was staying at a continental inn.

14:33.936 --> 14:35.036
We have agents at the hotel.

14:35.104 --> 14:36.571
No symptoms reported there either,

14:36.639 --> 14:38.940
But also no indication of any
information he was selling.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.441
Have you heard from walter?

14:40.509 --> 14:42.010
<i>Has he been able to
identify the virus?</i>

14:42.077 --> 14:43.444
No, not yet, but I'll
let you know when I do.

14:43.512 --> 14:45.246
Okay.

14:46.749 --> 14:49.250
if we can isolate the strain,

14:49.318 --> 14:52.887
We may be able to understand
this virus's personality.

14:52.955 --> 14:55.089
<i>The personality?</i>

14:55.157 --> 14:56.958
Walter, it's not a person.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.493
Centrifuge is over there.

15:01.764 --> 15:04.966
<i>No, viruses are not people, astrid.</i>

15:05.034 --> 15:08.136
But they seem to have minds of their own.

15:08.203 --> 15:11.706
The rabies virus

15:11.774 --> 15:14.075
Can't survive in water.

15:14.143 --> 15:18.179
So it inflicts its host with
a paralyzing fear of water.

15:18.247 --> 15:20.548
Walter, that sounds...

15:20.616 --> 15:23.384
Heh, trust me, I know how it sounds.

15:23.452 --> 15:24.585
It's almost beyond belief.

15:24.653 --> 15:26.921
<i>The more we learn about viruses,</i>

15:26.989 --> 15:29.257
<i>The more unbelievable they become.</i>

15:29.325 --> 15:31.826
They deny our definitions
of living and dead.

15:31.894 --> 15:34.562
<i>And their only function seems to be</i>

15:34.630 --> 15:36.898
To survive, to replicate.

15:36.965 --> 15:39.467
And they use us as a vehicle to do so.

15:39.535 --> 15:41.269
It's the folly of humans

15:41.337 --> 15:44.339
To believe we're at the
top of the food chain.

15:44.406 --> 15:46.307
In truth, viruses are.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.343
The strain won't isolate.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.844
The sample was too fragile.

15:49.912 --> 15:51.512
Damn it.

15:51.580 --> 15:52.847
I was afraid of that.

15:52.915 --> 15:55.316
Well, this is one piece of good news.

15:55.384 --> 15:57.752
I believe the virus is not airborne.

15:57.820 --> 15:58.753
No?

15:58.821 --> 15:59.954
No. If it were,

16:00.022 --> 16:01.389
There'd be many more people

16:01.457 --> 16:03.458
Showing signs of infection in that building.

16:03.525 --> 16:05.259
We need a better sample.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.132
Broyles have anything?

16:11.200 --> 16:12.400
No.

16:12.468 --> 16:14.202
Whatever vandenkemp was trying to sell,

16:14.269 --> 16:15.370
They can't find it.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.974
You able to get a hold of rachel?

16:20.042 --> 16:21.909
No.

16:21.977 --> 16:23.044
I didn't try.

16:26.915 --> 16:28.583
She just went through all this stuff

16:28.650 --> 16:29.717
With me in the hospital,

16:29.785 --> 16:30.752
And she's still having nightmares

16:30.819 --> 16:33.855
About me being dead.

16:33.922 --> 16:36.858
What's the point in scaring her again?

16:36.925 --> 16:39.093
We are gonna get out of this.

16:40.829 --> 16:42.230
That's just like you.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.268
Even now, you're protecting her.

16:50.005 --> 16:50.972
I thought that was the point

16:51.039 --> 16:51.973
Of having people who care about you

16:52.040 --> 16:54.075
In your life...

16:54.143 --> 16:56.811
To have someone to talk
to when you're scared.

17:07.589 --> 17:10.124
She's out.

17:10.192 --> 17:11.459
<i>The receptionist.</i>

17:41.657 --> 17:43.224
Aaaah!

18:08.150 --> 18:10.117
Peter...

18:21.363 --> 18:22.497
Dunham.

18:22.564 --> 18:23.998
What the hell's happening up there?

18:34.776 --> 18:36.511
Peter, be careful.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.448
Peter.

19:15.951 --> 19:16.951
Peter, no!

19:17.019 --> 19:18.486
Can't wait any longer.

19:18.554 --> 19:19.520
Stop it! Get away from him now!

19:19.588 --> 19:20.855
I got his blood on me.

19:20.923 --> 19:22.056
If I wasn't infected before,
I probably am now.

19:22.124 --> 19:23.391
Peter, this is insane!

19:23.458 --> 19:25.526
They're down there and we're up here.

19:25.594 --> 19:27.895
And they're not sending anybody else up.

19:27.963 --> 19:29.897
This is our last chance to
figure out whatever it was

19:29.965 --> 19:31.566
That he came here to try and sell.

19:34.236 --> 19:37.004
Rental car keys.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.339
Never take anything into a negotiation

19:38.407 --> 19:40.575
That can land you in jail.

19:40.642 --> 19:43.044
Always leave it in neutral territory.

19:56.425 --> 19:58.392
The cdc is opening the briefcase now.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.328
You said his car was found

20:00.395 --> 20:01.829
In a garage nearby.

20:01.897 --> 20:03.097
It's underground?

20:03.165 --> 20:04.231
That's right.

20:04.299 --> 20:06.834
I believe I have a hypothesis

20:06.902 --> 20:08.936
As to how this virus behaves.

20:09.004 --> 20:10.338
Go on.

20:10.405 --> 20:12.239
Well, the receptionist had
a very different reaction

20:12.307 --> 20:14.075
To the virus than the other two victims.

20:14.142 --> 20:15.509
And I believe I know why.

20:15.577 --> 20:17.011
This virus...

20:17.079 --> 20:19.380
Has to spread itself, but in order to do so,

20:19.448 --> 20:22.216
It needs other organisms to infect.

20:22.284 --> 20:25.186
Vandenkemp arrived alone at the building,

20:25.253 --> 20:27.154
And it wasn't until he was
in an office full of people

20:27.222 --> 20:28.489
That he sprayed.

20:28.557 --> 20:32.893
B-but...Having successfully
infected other people,

20:32.961 --> 20:34.962
I believe that the virus now senses

20:35.030 --> 20:37.665
That it's contained within the building,

20:37.733 --> 20:40.835
And--and it wants to get
outside to continue spreading.

20:40.902 --> 20:42.637
The virus wants to get outside?

20:42.704 --> 20:44.305
Yes, yeah.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.474
Doesn't that strike even
you as a bit far-fetched?

20:46.541 --> 20:48.976
No...The courier only spewed

20:49.044 --> 20:50.745
As he approached the glass doors.

20:50.812 --> 20:52.713
And from what you've said, the receptionist

20:52.781 --> 20:55.316
Showed an irrational desire to get outside,

20:55.384 --> 20:56.717
And then she sprayed.

20:56.785 --> 20:59.587
The virus compelled her
to leave the building.

20:59.655 --> 21:01.555
It wanted to get outside.

21:02.991 --> 21:04.959
You're saying the virus made her jump.

21:05.027 --> 21:08.362
Yes. Yes! I believe so.

21:21.343 --> 21:22.943
<i>Among other things in the briefcase,</i>

21:23.011 --> 21:25.346
We found a drill core sample

21:25.414 --> 21:26.714
From an exploratory oil dig.

21:40.595 --> 21:43.030
This is our virus.

21:49.385 --> 21:51.386
<i>The sample was stolen from solum oil
corp.</i>

21:52.103 --> 21:54.104
By normal procedure,
it would have been stored

21:54.172 --> 21:56.106
In an airtight, protective case.

21:56.174 --> 21:58.542
Which suggests vandenkemp
may have removed it

21:58.610 --> 22:00.077
In order to smuggle it out.

22:00.145 --> 22:03.314
Do those documents indicate
how far down it came from?

22:04.649 --> 22:06.350
<i>It came from ten miles down.</i>

22:10.121 --> 22:12.356
In that case,

22:12.424 --> 22:13.591
I believe we're in the presence

22:13.658 --> 22:15.859
Of a 75,000-year-old terror.

22:15.927 --> 22:17.194
One that might have been responsible

22:17.262 --> 22:19.663
For wiping out the ice age mammals.

22:19.731 --> 22:21.165
Some things are meant to be left alone.

22:21.232 --> 22:24.068
Dr. Bishop, can you find a cure for it?

22:24.135 --> 22:25.903
Maybe, in time.

22:25.971 --> 22:29.640
But right now, we need to
keep the safe people safe.

22:29.708 --> 22:31.742
Now that I have an isolated sample,

22:31.810 --> 22:33.744
I can produce a tox screen.

22:33.812 --> 22:36.213
At least we can identify
who's been infected.

22:36.281 --> 22:38.449
Would diamonds or emeralds do?

22:42.187 --> 22:43.520
<i>Agent dunham,</i>

22:43.588 --> 22:45.522
Bill hubert, cdc. Hi.

22:45.590 --> 22:47.291
So, uh, how do you want to do this?

22:47.359 --> 22:49.393
Two groups.

22:49.461 --> 22:50.961
We divide alphabetically.

22:51.029 --> 22:52.396
Okay, I can do that.

22:52.464 --> 22:54.798
"a" through ms, if you come with me.

22:54.866 --> 22:57.434
<i>And the rest can go with
agent hubert.</i>

23:08.647 --> 23:11.315
Call the state department.

23:11.383 --> 23:15.552
Get approval for a level six eradication.

23:15.620 --> 23:18.722
Level six?

23:18.790 --> 23:21.959
We don't know how to contain it.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.495
If anybody on the outside got infected...

23:31.236 --> 23:32.436
Thank you.

23:32.504 --> 23:33.737
No problem.

23:48.486 --> 23:50.054
How we doing in here?

23:50.121 --> 23:52.823
We're just getting started.

23:52.891 --> 23:56.226
<i>First up, vincent ames.</i>

23:56.294 --> 23:58.829
Hohow will I know?

23:58.897 --> 24:00.497
If you're infected,

24:00.565 --> 24:03.467
The solution will turn black.

24:03.535 --> 24:05.969
Swab.

24:06.037 --> 24:09.273
Please swab the inside of your cheek.

24:30.995 --> 24:33.063
Amber.

24:33.131 --> 24:34.364
You're clear.

24:38.737 --> 24:40.237
We'll be in touch.

24:40.305 --> 24:42.673
<i>All right, next is peter,</i>

24:42.741 --> 24:44.441
And then olivia.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.116
Ladies first.

24:56.721 --> 24:58.422
Swab your cheek.

25:27.051 --> 25:29.119
You're not infected.

25:32.791 --> 25:34.958
Peter.

26:20.638 --> 26:22.005
You're okay.

26:22.073 --> 26:23.140
You're okay.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.108
<i>Okay.</i>

26:25.176 --> 26:27.411
<i>Okay. Next.</i>

26:27.478 --> 26:30.113
Okay, let's get this first group downstairs.

26:30.181 --> 26:32.416
You guys, come with me. Let's go.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.230
This is the first batch of uninfected

26:46.297 --> 26:47.564
From both testing groups.

26:47.632 --> 26:49.867
Nona norris.

26:49.934 --> 26:52.569
Lauren nossel.

26:52.637 --> 26:54.738
Glen paulsen.

26:54.806 --> 26:56.573
Vincent ames.

26:59.310 --> 27:01.144
<i>Olivia dunham.</i>

27:02.947 --> 27:04.381
Peter bishop.

27:04.449 --> 27:05.716
Wait, stop!

27:05.783 --> 27:07.017
He's bleeding from the nose. He's infected.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.052
<i>I just have to get outside.</i>

27:09.120 --> 27:10.520
<i>Stop him! Get him away from the door!</i>

27:10.588 --> 27:11.655
I just have to get outside!

27:11.723 --> 27:14.091
Uhh!

27:14.158 --> 27:15.425
I just have to get outside.

27:21.866 --> 27:23.500
I'm infected?

27:23.568 --> 27:26.003
I'm afraid so.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.672
But I wasn't near anyone.

27:28.740 --> 27:31.541
<i>Steve, you need to come with me.</i>

27:38.149 --> 27:39.983
Olivia, please!

27:40.051 --> 27:41.618
Please, you've got to open this door.

27:41.686 --> 27:43.186
Peter, I can't. You know that.

27:43.254 --> 27:44.788
Look at me. Just look at me.

27:44.856 --> 27:46.056
I'm fine.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.357
Just look at me.

27:47.425 --> 27:49.993
Peter... Olivia...

27:50.061 --> 27:51.094
Olivia!

28:09.982 --> 28:11.816
Amber. You're clear.

28:18.257 --> 28:21.325
Olivia, we just finished the tox screens.

28:21.393 --> 28:22.694
Peter is infected.

28:22.761 --> 28:24.495
Peter?

28:24.563 --> 28:25.630
<i>Yeah, the test was wrong.</i>

28:25.698 --> 28:26.964
<i>I-I don't know how, but...</i>

28:27.032 --> 28:28.633
But he's bleeding from his nose

28:28.701 --> 28:31.569
And he's still in the building.

28:31.637 --> 28:34.639
Okay.

28:34.707 --> 28:37.041
What was that about peter?

28:40.913 --> 28:43.347
The cambodian outbreak of '04...

28:43.415 --> 28:45.049
Killed 7,300 people,

28:45.117 --> 28:46.417
Most of which could have been avoided

28:46.485 --> 28:48.686
If the chinese authorities
had moved quicker.

28:48.754 --> 28:50.121
That was level four.

28:50.189 --> 28:51.989
This is classified as six.

28:52.057 --> 28:55.393
Right now, it's the only option.

28:55.461 --> 28:57.495
Uh, they finished the tox screens.

28:57.563 --> 28:59.297
I heard.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.666
11 civilians infected, and your colleague.

29:01.734 --> 29:02.700
I'm sorry.

29:02.768 --> 29:04.802
So what do we do now?

29:04.870 --> 29:09.340
Extract the rest of the
ones that tested negative,

29:09.408 --> 29:10.975
And the state department has authorized us

29:11.043 --> 29:13.177
To have the army move
in and contain the rest.

29:13.245 --> 29:14.345
The army?

29:14.413 --> 29:15.480
Dunham.

29:15.547 --> 29:16.547
It's the only definitive way

29:16.615 --> 29:17.815
To make sure that the virus is eradicated.

29:17.883 --> 29:19.150
There are still a dozen
people in that building.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.384
You cannot tell me that killing them

29:20.452 --> 29:22.286
Is our only option.

29:22.354 --> 29:23.454
Come with me.

29:25.357 --> 29:26.691
Run it for her.

29:28.894 --> 29:30.161
This model is based

29:30.229 --> 29:32.363
<i>On just one of those
people getting out</i>

29:32.431 --> 29:34.699
And infecting someone on the outside.

29:34.767 --> 29:36.033
This is two weeks from now.

29:37.836 --> 29:39.704
<i>We have no symptom blocker, no cure.</i>

29:39.772 --> 29:42.173
What solution do you propose, agent dunham?

29:56.188 --> 29:58.055
Walter...

29:58.123 --> 30:00.525
Walter, you can't take that off.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.326
It doesn't matter.

30:02.394 --> 30:04.896
The virus isn't airborne.

30:04.963 --> 30:09.100
It's transmitted by bodily fluid
s- -blood, saliva.

30:09.168 --> 30:12.136
Walter, we are going to figure this out.

30:12.204 --> 30:14.939
Peter's gonna be fine.

30:17.776 --> 30:19.177
It's time to go.

30:19.244 --> 30:21.078
We're taking all non-infected personnel

30:21.146 --> 30:23.047
Out of the building--now.

30:26.318 --> 30:27.852
<i>Walter, we'll have to help peter</i>

30:27.920 --> 30:29.487
<i>From outside.</i>

30:33.025 --> 30:35.293
Come on, walter, let's go.

30:42.034 --> 30:43.668
Astrid, where are you?

30:43.735 --> 30:45.303
Walter won't leave.

30:45.370 --> 30:46.838
He thinks he can come up with a cure.

30:46.905 --> 30:48.873
Does he have any idea how to do that?

30:48.941 --> 30:51.609
No, not yet.

30:51.677 --> 30:53.110
Astrid, they're giving up.

30:53.178 --> 30:55.613
The--the cdc doesn't want
to risk contamination,

30:55.681 --> 30:58.149
<i>So they're planning on killing
everyone inside.</i>

30:58.217 --> 30:59.450
You can't be in there.

31:02.354 --> 31:04.589
Walter will figure something out.

31:04.656 --> 31:05.590
We're gonna be fine.

31:05.657 --> 31:06.824
<i>Astrid...</i>

31:10.295 --> 31:11.729
What did agent dunham want?

31:11.797 --> 31:13.231
Nothing.

31:13.298 --> 31:16.467
Help me drag this dutchman into the kitchen.

31:16.535 --> 31:18.903
There's a table in there, and a sink.

31:25.911 --> 31:31.148
Homo sapiens persevered 100 millennia ago.

31:31.216 --> 31:34.986
So something must have killed this virus.

31:35.053 --> 31:39.090
Slower metabolisms, evolving blood types.

31:41.727 --> 31:45.897
Unless the wretched virus
isn't organism-specific.

31:45.964 --> 31:49.000
If I had an animal, a cat or a mouse...

31:49.067 --> 31:52.136
No. No, no, no.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.438
No, there's no time for that, of course.

31:54.506 --> 31:57.008
Walter...What can I do?

32:07.286 --> 32:09.754
I can't let peter die again.

32:11.757 --> 32:15.860
He's going to.

32:15.928 --> 32:18.829
They all will.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.432
There's nothing I can do about it.

32:26.305 --> 32:29.340
Walter, do you remember this morning?

32:29.408 --> 32:31.876
What you said at the science museum.

32:31.944 --> 32:33.678
You said that magellan
set sail around the world

32:33.745 --> 32:36.948
With a crew of 237 people.

32:37.015 --> 32:39.083
237.

32:39.151 --> 32:41.385
Nearly all of whom died.

32:41.453 --> 32:44.355
Yeah, but 18 of them didn't.

32:44.423 --> 32:46.691
That's what you said, walter.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.259
Despite the odds,

32:48.327 --> 32:50.761
18 of them came back to their families.

32:50.829 --> 32:53.497
The rest died of scurvy.

32:53.565 --> 32:56.067
A slow, horrific death.

32:56.134 --> 33:00.638
Uncontrollable diarrhea, pustulous bleeding.

33:00.706 --> 33:02.273
They all died.

33:09.481 --> 33:12.917
Except...We're still here.

33:17.255 --> 33:19.724
75,000 years ago,

33:19.791 --> 33:24.362
Our virus here wiped the planet clean.

33:24.429 --> 33:26.764
Then life resumed.

33:28.934 --> 33:32.837
So something... Must have killed

33:32.904 --> 33:35.006
The active virus.

33:39.578 --> 33:41.012
Ash. Astrid.

33:41.079 --> 33:43.714
No...Ash.

33:46.251 --> 33:48.252
Mount toba...

33:48.320 --> 33:50.488
The biggest volcanic eruption

33:50.555 --> 33:53.190
For the last 25 million years.

33:53.258 --> 33:55.493
It blocked out the sun.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.764
Sulfuric ash rained down

33:59.831 --> 34:01.699
All around the world.

34:04.569 --> 34:05.970
Sulfur.

34:06.038 --> 34:07.471
Sulfur!

34:07.539 --> 34:08.606
That could be it.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.107
Where do we get sulfur?

34:10.175 --> 34:11.609
Open the fridge.

34:11.676 --> 34:14.745
<i>Now, tell me what we've
got to work with.</i>

34:14.813 --> 34:17.214
Um...There's diet soda.

34:17.282 --> 34:19.550
There's relish, there's, uh...

34:19.618 --> 34:21.418
There's yogurt, there's string cheese,

34:21.485 --> 34:22.853
There's horseradish, there's milk--

34:22.920 --> 34:25.289
Ooh, horseradish! Horseradish,
good. Grab that.

34:28.726 --> 34:32.897
The glycoside in horseradish
is high in sulfur.

34:32.964 --> 34:37.701
If I'm right, this should attack the virus.

35:25.217 --> 35:26.517
Thank you.

35:26.585 --> 35:30.488
Sulfide diluted to four parts per million.

35:30.555 --> 35:33.090
Then apply heat to catalyze the base.

35:33.158 --> 35:35.159
1.5 ccs should be enough.

35:35.227 --> 35:36.160
Okay.

35:36.228 --> 35:37.428
<i>I got it.</i>

35:42.033 --> 35:44.502
<i>After we've notified the
families of the deceased,</i>

35:44.569 --> 35:46.103
We'll release a statement.

35:46.171 --> 35:47.571
The virus has been controlled.

35:47.639 --> 35:49.206
And we don't have any fear
of a further outbreak.

35:49.274 --> 35:51.542
Walter found a cure.

35:51.610 --> 35:52.843
I'll call you back.

35:52.911 --> 35:54.411
This is what he needs.

35:56.081 --> 35:57.781
Sulfide base, neuraminidase blocker.

35:57.849 --> 35:59.316
We'd need a chemical supply lab.

35:59.384 --> 36:00.651
The closest one's in wellesley.

36:00.719 --> 36:01.819
Okay.

36:01.887 --> 36:04.021
And several hours to
synthesize the antidote.

36:06.057 --> 36:08.159
<i>I'm sorry, agent dunham, we just don't have
that long.</i>

36:08.226 --> 36:10.861
<i>That glass isn't gonna
hold much longer.</i>

36:10.929 --> 36:11.862
What if we could buy you some time?

36:11.930 --> 36:12.897
What are you thinking?

36:12.964 --> 36:14.431
Fentanyl gas.

36:14.499 --> 36:15.733
Pump it inside the building.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.701
Knock them out long enough
to synthesize a cure.

36:17.769 --> 36:19.436
<i>We could have a gas truck
here in ten minutes.</i>

36:19.504 --> 36:20.738
No, even if we could, it wouldn't disperse.

36:20.805 --> 36:22.173
The building's ventilation system is down,

36:22.240 --> 36:23.574
And I can't risk sending any
more of my people inside

36:23.642 --> 36:24.642
To turn it on.

36:24.709 --> 36:26.877
Then I'll do it.

36:30.849 --> 36:32.850
That's up to agent broyles, not me.

36:36.288 --> 36:37.321
You've got 15 minutes.

36:37.389 --> 36:39.223
After that, I can't take the chance.

36:39.291 --> 36:40.424
Yes, sir.

37:00.164 --> 37:02.165
<i>let us out!</i>

37:10.007 --> 37:11.308
<i>dunham, the gas truck is here.</i>

37:11.376 --> 37:12.376
<i>What's your 20?</i>

37:12.444 --> 37:14.011
I'm in the elevator,

37:14.079 --> 37:15.479
Proceeding to the parking garage.

37:44.342 --> 37:46.043
Uhh! Ohh!

37:52.484 --> 37:54.318
Listen, I'm here to help you.

37:54.386 --> 37:55.819
Give me the gun, olivia.

37:55.887 --> 37:57.087
Peter, they're gonna shoot you.

37:57.155 --> 37:59.490
They're gonna kill us all anyway.

37:59.557 --> 38:02.526
The cure is out there. They're lying to us.

38:02.594 --> 38:04.695
And you locked me in here.

38:04.763 --> 38:06.597
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

38:06.665 --> 38:08.032
You betrayed me!

38:09.534 --> 38:11.035
Ahh!

38:16.341 --> 38:17.675
Uhh!

38:22.080 --> 38:23.847
Hyuh! Agh!

38:29.554 --> 38:31.956
Stay down.

38:35.193 --> 38:36.794
Dunham.

38:36.861 --> 38:38.729
Agent dunham, can you hear me?

38:47.405 --> 38:48.572
Agent farnsworth.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.640
<i>Sir.</i>

38:49.708 --> 38:50.975
Is the ventilation system on yet?

38:52.477 --> 38:54.345
No, sir. It's still off.

38:54.412 --> 38:56.213
<i>Olivia hasn't made it yet.</i>

38:57.782 --> 38:59.183
We have to move.

38:59.250 --> 39:01.151
I gave you 15 minutes.

39:01.219 --> 39:04.054
I understand you have
operational authority here.

39:04.122 --> 39:06.590
But there are people in there
that are like family to me.

39:06.658 --> 39:07.891
Another ten minutes.

39:07.959 --> 39:09.293
I'm sorry.

39:55.874 --> 39:58.375
Here, put this on.

39:58.443 --> 39:59.777
Trust me.

40:49.294 --> 40:53.797
You're going to be okay, peter.

40:53.865 --> 40:55.766
Just rest, son.

41:17.655 --> 41:19.456
Son.

41:22.260 --> 41:24.061
Thank you.

41:28.733 --> 41:30.734
All of you.

41:32.904 --> 41:34.538
You feeling better?

41:36.808 --> 41:37.774
Olivia...

41:42.347 --> 41:43.547
I'm sorry.

41:46.351 --> 41:47.451
You weren't yourself.

41:50.755 --> 41:52.389
It's lucky for me that you were.

42:14.078 --> 42:15.712
Walter.

42:20.585 --> 42:22.853
Um...

42:22.921 --> 42:26.690
Inside...Upstairs...

42:26.758 --> 42:30.761
When you said, "
I can't let peter die again..."

42:36.201 --> 42:38.368
What did you mean by that?

42:42.040 --> 42:44.141
Some things are meant to be left alone,

42:44.209 --> 42:46.510
Agent farnsworth.
