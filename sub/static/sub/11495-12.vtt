00:00.734 --> 00:02.266
<i>Previously on</i>
Two and a Half Men...

00:02.291 --> 00:03.777
I am determined to find

00:03.877 --> 00:05.154
someone who wants
to be with me

00:05.155 --> 00:07.398
for who I am, not what I have.

00:07.644 --> 00:09.493
My point is you can be whoever
you want to be.

00:09.781 --> 00:10.896
I can help you out with that.

00:10.898 --> 00:13.182
I appreciate it... Kate.

00:13.184 --> 00:14.233
Sam Wilson.

00:14.235 --> 00:16.184
Maybe you could crash here.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.236
Have you really
thought this through?

00:17.238 --> 00:19.538
I got to see
where this goes with Kate.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.790
I think it is great

00:20.792 --> 00:22.875
that you're working on
your computer stuff,

00:22.877 --> 00:24.526
but we need help now.

00:24.528 --> 00:25.544
Say no more.

00:25.546 --> 00:27.746
I'll start looking
for a job.

00:32.418 --> 00:33.702
Hey.

00:33.704 --> 00:36.972
Oh, look who finally
decided to show up.

00:36.974 --> 00:38.874
Uh, yeah, I got
stuck in traffic.

00:38.876 --> 00:39.975
Traffic, pfft.

00:39.977 --> 00:42.645
You were with <i>her,</i>
weren't you?

00:42.647 --> 00:45.014
Really, Alan?

00:45.016 --> 00:46.849
Well, I don't mean to sound
like a broken record,

00:46.851 --> 00:48.067
but you're never
home anymore.

00:48.069 --> 00:49.602
I was just there
the other night.

00:49.604 --> 00:50.903
And all you did
was watch the game

00:50.905 --> 00:52.938
and fall asleep.
Remember how we used

00:52.940 --> 00:55.224
to stay up all night
and just talk?

00:55.226 --> 00:57.993
Okay, you know, fine,
we can talk now.

00:57.995 --> 00:58.944
What's on your mind?

00:58.946 --> 01:00.395
Nothing. I'm fine.

01:00.397 --> 01:03.899
I'm not
a mind reader, Alan.

01:03.901 --> 01:06.836
Well, not that
you care, but...

01:06.838 --> 01:08.621
I'm rattling around
in that big house

01:08.623 --> 01:09.622
all by myself.

01:09.624 --> 01:12.958
I miss you.
There, I said it.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.210
I miss you, too.

01:14.212 --> 01:16.411
Well, you got a funny
way of showing it.

01:16.413 --> 01:18.848
You do understand I have
a girlfriend, right?

01:18.850 --> 01:19.748
So do I.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.684
A-Another peach
mojito, please.

01:21.686 --> 01:23.886
What are you drinking?
It's on me.

01:23.888 --> 01:25.387
And by "on me,"
I mean the money

01:25.389 --> 01:26.805
you left me to
pay the bills,

01:26.807 --> 01:28.357
which, incidentally,
I used for other stuff,

01:28.359 --> 01:30.259
so I'll need money
to pay the bills.

01:32.479 --> 01:34.196
I'll have
a ginger ale, please.

01:34.198 --> 01:35.481
Ginger ale?

01:35.483 --> 01:37.483
Yeah, my stomach's
been bothering me.

01:37.485 --> 01:39.268
I haven't really been
feeling myself lately.

01:39.270 --> 01:40.435
Which self would
that be?

01:40.437 --> 01:42.104
Walden Schmidt
or Sam Wilson?

01:42.106 --> 01:44.990
Sam Wilson has
a lot of stress.

01:44.992 --> 01:46.375
Thank you.

01:46.377 --> 01:47.459
Money's tight.

01:47.461 --> 01:49.611
You'd be surprised
what that does to a guy.

01:49.613 --> 01:51.163
Please, I've been so
desperate for money,

01:51.165 --> 01:52.831
I've climbed into
fountains at night

01:52.833 --> 01:55.467
and stolen the
wishes of children.

01:55.469 --> 01:57.136
So you get it.

01:57.138 --> 01:58.420
What I don't get
is why you don't

01:58.422 --> 02:00.306
resolve the stress and just
tell Kate the truth.

02:00.308 --> 02:01.590
That's not gonna happen.

02:01.592 --> 02:02.641
Why not?
I don't know,

02:02.643 --> 02:04.293
everything's
going so great,

02:04.295 --> 02:05.811
I don't want
to screw it up.

02:05.813 --> 02:08.681
Oh, that's not good.

worth 79 cents.

02:31.883 --> 02:33.167
What's the matter?

02:33.169 --> 02:36.704
My life has been
a complete waste of time.

Wait, is this...
is this one of

Mm-hmm.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.013
Why are you throwing it away?

02:46.015 --> 02:48.933
Because, apparently...
my stuff's not good enough

02:48.935 --> 02:51.519
to get a job
that pays nothing.

02:51.521 --> 02:53.521

who assists the guy
who designs Snooki's

03:00.113 --> 03:03.531
signature line
of baby thongs.

03:03.533 --> 03:06.016
Okay, don't worry,
you're gonna get next one.

03:06.018 --> 03:08.619
There is no next one.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.488
I mean, obviously

03:10.490 --> 03:12.690
I don't have what it takes
to be a fashion designer.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.126
And at a certain point,
I just have to bite the bullet

03:15.128 --> 03:16.877
and admit it is not happening.

03:16.879 --> 03:18.579
But you're not at that point.

03:18.581 --> 03:20.047
Three words:

03:20.049 --> 03:21.532
Snooki's...

03:21.534 --> 03:22.866
baby...

03:22.868 --> 03:24.919
thongs!

03:24.921 --> 03:27.037
I think your designs are great.

03:27.039 --> 03:29.423
You have to say that;
I have sex with you.

03:30.692 --> 03:32.059
True.

03:32.061 --> 03:36.230
But if I was a woman,
I would totally wear this dress.

03:37.182 --> 03:38.549
Hell, three shots of tequila

03:38.551 --> 03:40.067
and I would wear this dress.

03:40.885 --> 03:42.987
And I would work it!

03:42.989 --> 03:45.723
Okay, don't make me laugh
when I'm trying to cry.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.525
Too late, because
I am fierce.

03:52.664 --> 03:54.064
I love you, Sam.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.901
Uh, you have to say that;
I have sex with you.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.253
Okay, the real test is,

03:59.255 --> 04:01.739
will you have sex with me
wearing that dress?

04:01.741 --> 04:05.426
You get the tequila,
I'll go put on some heels.

04:09.131 --> 04:11.265
Lightly salted,
just the way you like.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.050
Mm, thanks.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.969
Who could've seen
this coming?

04:14.971 --> 04:15.936
Right.

04:15.938 --> 04:17.721
We end up with the house.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.190
Unbelievable.

04:20.192 --> 04:21.726
You know how
I used to say

04:21.728 --> 04:23.694
you'd have to pay me
to hang out with you?

04:23.696 --> 04:24.695
Yeah.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.864
Here we are!

04:27.733 --> 04:28.983
Hey, guys.

04:28.985 --> 04:30.100
Mm.!

04:30.102 --> 04:32.069
Oh, Look who it is.
Sam Wilson.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.204
Hey, Alan,

04:33.206 --> 04:34.622
can I, can I talk to you
for a second?

04:34.624 --> 04:35.606
Oh, sure.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.908
The principal wants to see me.
Mm.

04:39.211 --> 04:41.962
Oh, uh, Berta,
I brought some laundry by.

04:41.964 --> 04:43.297
Uh, do you mind?

04:43.299 --> 04:46.000
It's your machine.
Knock yourself out.

04:49.504 --> 04:51.272
So, what's up?

04:51.274 --> 04:54.141
I'm transferring $100,000
into your bank account.

04:54.143 --> 04:57.061
A hundred... thousand...

04:57.063 --> 04:58.345
Catch me, Lord.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.481
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

05:00.483 --> 05:01.899
I-I think I need
to sit down.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.250
Yeah, yeah.
I...

05:03.252 --> 05:05.302
I-I could swear
that I heard you say

05:05.304 --> 05:07.321
you were gonna put
$100,000 into my account.

05:07.323 --> 05:08.355
I am.

05:08.357 --> 05:10.524
There it goes again.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.610
It's-it's like the teacups
at Disneyland.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.246
How can I ever thank you?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.147
The money's not for you,
it's for Kate.

05:17.149 --> 05:18.999
Next time, lead with that.

05:19.001 --> 05:21.001
I want you to invest
in her fashion designs.

05:21.003 --> 05:23.003
What?
She's really talented,

05:23.005 --> 05:24.655
but nobody will
give her a shot.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.323
Are you sure she's talented?

05:26.325 --> 05:27.991
It isn't just
boom-shaka-laka-laka,

05:27.993 --> 05:29.710
boom-shaka-laka-laka?

05:30.695 --> 05:32.996
I'm about to give you
a boom-shaka-laka.

05:34.499 --> 05:37.268
No, $100,000 will help
her start her company.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.186
So give it to her.
I can't.

05:39.188 --> 05:40.688
I'm Sam Wilson.
I'm broke.

05:40.690 --> 05:42.840
But you can,
because you're

05:42.842 --> 05:44.642
Alan Harper,
billionaire.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.844
Oh...

05:48.697 --> 05:51.482
Fashion's kind of risky.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.985
And Alan Harper did not
become a billionaire

05:54.987 --> 05:57.004
by taking unnecessary risks.

05:57.006 --> 06:00.357
You are taking an
unnecessary risk right now.

06:00.359 --> 06:03.127
No, I-I'm just saying that I'd
rather put my money into gold,

06:03.129 --> 06:04.578
or maybe start a vineyard.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.029
Alancrest.

06:06.031 --> 06:09.383
You know, fine, when
you make $100,000--

06:09.385 --> 06:11.085
I don't even have
to finish that.

06:11.087 --> 06:14.922
I-I want <i>my</i> money
invested in Kate.

06:14.924 --> 06:17.007
Okay, no problem.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.977
But I'll have to see
some of her sketches first.

06:19.979 --> 06:20.339
Alan.

06:20.364 --> 06:22.290
What? You want this to be
believable, don't you?

06:22.765 --> 06:24.031
Okay, fine.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.399
Have us over
tomorrow night.

06:25.401 --> 06:27.101
Ooh, kind of short notice.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.435
Alan!

06:28.437 --> 06:29.737
Can't we do this at your house?

06:29.739 --> 06:32.940
This is my house!

06:35.827 --> 06:39.897
Awfully rude for a guy
who wants my money.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:51.126 --> 06:54.445
It's like you've never
washed a dish in your life.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.514
What are you
talking about?

06:56.516 --> 06:58.966
There's still SpaghettiOs
on this plate.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.053
Well, you're the one
that wanted to be all fancy

07:03.055 --> 07:05.940
and said we couldn't eat them
straight out of the can.

07:06.858 --> 07:07.975
Ugh.

07:07.977 --> 07:11.028
Oh, speaking of fancy,
I saw Alan today.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.730
Ew.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.616
It was actually a really
interesting conversation.

07:15.618 --> 07:18.035
He's looking for some
new investments.

07:18.037 --> 07:21.288
He should go and buy himself
a better personality.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.157
Nobody's that rich.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.243
Uh, but I did tell him
that you're trying to start

07:26.245 --> 07:27.778
your own fashion company.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.446
Oh, Sam, you didn't.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.081
Oh, but I did.

07:32.117 --> 07:33.801
Well, he's in a position
to help you.

07:33.803 --> 07:35.252
I don't want his help.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.004
Unless I'm gonna start
a line called

07:37.006 --> 07:39.340
House of Douche.

07:39.342 --> 07:40.641
Don't be ridiculous.

07:40.643 --> 07:42.960
I'm sure that name's
already taken.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.980
Hey, he could be the answer
to all your problems.

07:45.982 --> 07:47.297
Oh, I don't know.

07:47.299 --> 07:48.515
Before you say no,

07:48.517 --> 07:50.184
he invited us over
tomorrow night

07:50.186 --> 07:52.186
so you can show him
your designs.

07:53.104 --> 07:55.689
Really think he'd invest in me?

07:55.691 --> 07:57.358
He'd have to be an idiot not to.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.993
But he is an idiot.

07:58.995 --> 08:01.645
True.

08:02.697 --> 08:04.114
Give it a chance?

08:04.116 --> 08:05.482
All right.

08:05.484 --> 08:06.667
I'll do it.

08:06.669 --> 08:09.203
Great. Oh, did I mention
that if you take his money,

08:09.205 --> 08:10.704
you have to
sleep with him?

08:12.758 --> 08:15.175
I'm kidding;
I'll totally do him.

08:25.503 --> 08:27.137
Ah! Sam, Kate.

08:27.139 --> 08:28.672
Welcome to Alancrest.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.058
W-Why are you
wearing pajamas?

08:31.060 --> 08:32.693
I'm rich. I can.

08:32.695 --> 08:35.229
Mm. You have
a beautiful home.

08:35.231 --> 08:37.014
It'll work
until my castle's finished.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.533
<i>Entrez-vous.</i>

08:39.534 --> 08:42.035
Uh, that's French for
"enter, you."

08:42.038 --> 08:43.504
Oh, look,

08:43.506 --> 08:45.239
my panoramic ocean view.

08:45.241 --> 08:47.574
You can follow my
seagulls on Twitter.

08:48.710 --> 08:50.744
Hashtag, "Gulls gone wild."

08:51.997 --> 08:53.196
Oh, ah, delightful!

08:53.198 --> 08:55.582
Thank you, Berta.
That will be all.

08:55.584 --> 08:57.718
Damn right it will!

08:57.720 --> 09:00.370
She's been
with the family for years.

09:00.372 --> 09:02.089
They say you're not really rich

09:02.091 --> 09:04.207
until you have servants
who hate you.

09:04.209 --> 09:07.311
Uh, Alan, Kate brought
her portfolio to show you.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.595
Oh, yes!

09:08.597 --> 09:10.147
Kate, please
take a seat.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.598
Take my breath away!

09:11.600 --> 09:13.767
Oh, I'd love to.

09:13.769 --> 09:16.904
I made some new sketches
just for you.

09:16.906 --> 09:18.739
Uh, yeah, she's been
working really hard on them.

09:18.741 --> 09:20.774
I-I think you're really
gonna like what you see.

09:20.776 --> 09:21.742
No offense, Sam,

09:21.744 --> 09:23.944
but look at the
way <i>you</i> dress.

09:24.829 --> 09:26.530
Mm.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.831
All right.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.950
Oh, it's-it's nice.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.669
No, I-I like
what you did here.

09:31.671 --> 09:32.736
Thank you.

09:33.705 --> 09:35.506
Uh, cap sleeves are
last season, but,

09:35.508 --> 09:37.741
you know, okay.

09:38.576 --> 09:40.010
Oh, you know,
I'm kind of done

09:40.012 --> 09:42.092
with rompers, but I understand
what you're going for.

09:43.081 --> 09:44.348
Oh, oh.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.683
Velvet.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.101
Kind of whorish.

09:47.103 --> 09:49.636
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

09:49.638 --> 09:52.473
You know what, uh, Kate,
why don't you run out to the car

09:52.475 --> 09:53.724
and grab some of your samples.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.893
I think Alan would
love to see them.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.444
Yeah, sure.

09:57.446 --> 10:00.064
Just hope
they're not too whorish.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.098
Yeah.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.233
Let's leave that
to Lady Gaga.

10:05.286 --> 10:06.904
Ow!

10:08.039 --> 10:09.957
What the hell
is the matter with you?

10:09.959 --> 10:12.376
Me? She's the one
who paired an empire waist

10:12.378 --> 10:14.461
with a Peter Pan collar!

10:14.463 --> 10:19.383
You're supposed to be a simple
rich guy, not a gay Bruce Wayne.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.386
Hey, hey, you have
your character, I have mine.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.139
Well, your character is a
festering heap of human waste!

10:25.141 --> 10:28.008
I think we both know, if I had
money, I'd be the biggest

10:28.010 --> 10:31.428
festering heap of human waste
that ever lived!

10:31.430 --> 10:34.314
All you have to do is tell her
that you want to invest

10:34.316 --> 10:36.100
and give her my $100,000.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.403
Well, fine,
but velvet is whorish.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.021
Okay, here we are.

10:41.023 --> 10:43.690
Uh, let's see.

10:43.692 --> 10:45.809
This is a cute, little shift

10:45.811 --> 10:47.778
that goes from
day to night.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.780
I love them all!
What?

10:49.782 --> 10:51.165
You-you haven't even seen them.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.500
I've seen all I
need to see, Kate.

10:53.502 --> 10:55.836
I want to invest in
your line of clothing.

10:55.838 --> 10:56.620
Really?

10:56.622 --> 10:57.621
Yes! Now tell me,

10:57.623 --> 10:58.672
what's our
business plan?

10:58.674 --> 11:00.174
Well, it depends.
If I had enough money,

11:00.176 --> 11:02.009
I'd put a show together for
Fashion Week in New York.

11:02.011 --> 11:03.093
That way, I'd be able to...

11:03.095 --> 11:05.829
Sounds great. Pack
your bags for New York,

11:05.831 --> 11:10.500
because I'm gonna write
you a check for $50,000.

11:10.502 --> 11:12.519
What?!

11:12.521 --> 11:13.887
Sam, did you hear that?

11:13.889 --> 11:15.305
Uh, yeah, I did.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.840
What's the-- $50,000?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.192
I-I know it's a lot.

11:18.194 --> 11:20.844
But I believe in her, and
I want to take a chance.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.112
Uh, well,

11:22.114 --> 11:23.814
if you really believe
in her, maybe you'd...

11:23.816 --> 11:25.732
maybe you'd like to invest
a little bit more.

11:25.734 --> 11:26.349
Sam.

11:26.351 --> 11:27.484
No, no, no.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.620
He's right.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.072
I'm gonna hate
myself for this.

11:32.074 --> 11:34.458
But what the heck.

11:34.460 --> 11:38.045
$60,000.

11:44.535 --> 11:48.472
I can't believe Alan
gave me $100,000.

11:48.474 --> 11:52.092
I can't believe
it took him two hours to do it.

11:52.094 --> 11:54.428
Thank you.

11:54.430 --> 11:56.880
What are you thanking me for?

11:56.882 --> 11:59.933
Because I know none of this
would've happened without you.

11:59.935 --> 12:01.935
I just introduced you.

12:01.937 --> 12:04.321
Your whorish velvet
did the rest.

12:07.243 --> 12:09.243
You are the sweetest...

12:09.245 --> 12:11.912
most generous...

12:11.914 --> 12:14.281
open, giving...

12:14.283 --> 12:17.034
caring, genuine person
I've ever met, Sam Wilson.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.786
That's me.

12:19.788 --> 12:23.340
Good old Sam Wilson.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.126
This whole thing...
is incredible.

12:26.128 --> 12:27.577
I am so excited.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.346
Me, too.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.349
Are you sure?

12:32.351 --> 12:33.717
What do you mean?

12:33.719 --> 12:35.719
Well, it just
seems like, um,

12:35.721 --> 12:38.689
Little Sam doesn't have
his head in the game.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.275
Um...

12:41.277 --> 12:43.277
Yeah.

12:43.279 --> 12:44.511
I...

12:44.513 --> 12:46.079
Maybe I just need a minute.

12:46.081 --> 12:48.315
Okay.

12:52.787 --> 12:54.955
Do you think I'm fat?

13:12.444 --> 13:13.476
Alan.

13:13.478 --> 13:15.162
Wake up.

13:15.164 --> 13:17.698
Mm... what, what?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.266
Walden.

13:19.268 --> 13:21.468
What-what am I doing
in your bed?

13:21.470 --> 13:25.505
I... I-I must have
been sleepwalking, I...

13:25.507 --> 13:28.125
Relax, Alan,
I just want to talk.

13:28.127 --> 13:29.259
What's going on?

13:29.261 --> 13:30.827
It's 3:00 in the morning.

13:30.829 --> 13:32.662
I... I haven't been able
to sleep lately.

13:32.664 --> 13:34.298
In fact, my
whole life

13:34.300 --> 13:35.999
is falling apart.

13:36.001 --> 13:39.019
I'm, like, I'm losing my hair,
I'm gaining weight,

13:39.021 --> 13:41.772
I'm all itchy
and twitchy, I...

13:41.774 --> 13:43.940
I haven't had
a solid stool in a week.

13:43.942 --> 13:48.111
So far, you're describing
my typical Tuesday.

13:48.113 --> 13:50.397
The worst part is...

13:50.399 --> 13:52.182
I can't get an erection.

13:53.518 --> 13:55.619
All right, just let me
brush my teeth.

13:57.288 --> 13:59.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, uh...

14:03.361 --> 14:05.162
What?

14:05.997 --> 14:07.197
What?

14:08.249 --> 14:09.916
Oh, uh, yeah, you know,

14:09.918 --> 14:11.368
I'm kind of,
I'm kind of half-asleep.

14:11.370 --> 14:13.303
Yeah, wow.

14:13.305 --> 14:14.755
Wow, that's a...
that is a problem.

14:14.757 --> 14:16.039
Yeah, yeah.

14:20.678 --> 14:23.597
Has this ever happened
to you before?

14:23.599 --> 14:24.898
Oh, me? No, no.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.150
I, uh, I have
amazing control.

14:27.152 --> 14:29.052
Wait, watch this.

14:30.905 --> 14:33.073
Got an erection.

14:35.910 --> 14:37.894
Now it's gone.

14:40.731 --> 14:42.065
Back.

14:42.067 --> 14:43.700
Gone.

14:43.702 --> 14:44.734
Are you done?

14:44.736 --> 14:46.920
Back.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.874
Gone.

14:50.876 --> 14:54.261
Look, every guy has
this happen at some point.

14:54.263 --> 14:56.913
It's never happened to me before
and it's driving me crazy.

14:56.915 --> 14:59.099
You know, it's possible that the
problem is not in your pants.

14:59.101 --> 15:00.600
Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:00.602 --> 15:03.303
The problem is
definitely in my pants.

15:03.305 --> 15:04.421
No, look at you.

15:04.423 --> 15:06.273
I mean, the stress
of living a lie

15:06.275 --> 15:08.275
is causing you
to just fall apart.

15:08.277 --> 15:09.476
You're binge eating.

15:09.478 --> 15:11.311
No, I am not
binge eating.

15:11.313 --> 15:14.364
You get a free candy bar
when you buy four corn dogs.

15:15.433 --> 15:18.235
That's just
smart shopping.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.203
This all started
when you became Sam Wilson,

15:20.205 --> 15:22.439
and I submit to you
that he's the one

15:22.441 --> 15:24.708
who can't pop his weasel,
not Walden Schmidt.

15:24.710 --> 15:26.993
Why don't you just
tell Kate the truth?

15:26.995 --> 15:29.629
I'm afraid if I'm honest
with her now,

15:29.631 --> 15:31.748
she'll just leave me.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.467
Okay, well, if you want
your boner back,

15:33.469 --> 15:35.618
you're gonna have to, you know,
tell her the truth

15:35.620 --> 15:36.887
and trust that the strength

15:36.889 --> 15:38.455
of your love will carry
you through...

15:38.457 --> 15:39.589
Or?

15:39.591 --> 15:42.642
Or you're gonna need
a little help.

15:42.644 --> 15:44.627
All right,
go brush your teeth.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.434
I'm kidding!

15:50.436 --> 15:52.903
Yeah, yeah.

15:52.905 --> 15:54.105
'Cause-'cause that'd be weird.

15:55.974 --> 15:58.191
Look, what I meant was
that I happen

15:58.193 --> 15:59.910
to know a 65-year-old man

15:59.912 --> 16:01.978
who'll give you
a stiffy in no time.

16:02.980 --> 16:06.249
Okay, that also sounded weird.

16:08.169 --> 16:10.287
And it's back.

16:13.157 --> 16:15.125
All right, Walden,
how hard do you want it?

16:15.127 --> 16:18.512
Redwood tree, tungsten steel
or Chinese algebra?

16:18.514 --> 16:20.964
I'm not looking
to frighten anybody.

16:20.966 --> 16:22.215
Really?

16:22.217 --> 16:26.019
I like eyes to widen
when I unsheathe the sword.

16:26.021 --> 16:28.472
Well, tell you what.

16:28.474 --> 16:30.974
Why don't I just put together
a little grab bag for you.

16:30.976 --> 16:31.975
I got one of those.

16:31.977 --> 16:33.360
I call it
"boner roulette."

16:33.362 --> 16:34.978
You never know what
you're gonna get,

16:34.980 --> 16:36.980
but you're a
wiener every time.

16:38.033 --> 16:39.649
I'm gonna
start you off

16:39.651 --> 16:41.034
with a couple of pink ones here.

16:41.036 --> 16:43.036
These are good
for a mid-week quickie.

16:43.038 --> 16:44.654
And these green ones

16:44.656 --> 16:47.357
I recommend for solo work.

16:47.359 --> 16:48.825
Oh!

16:48.827 --> 16:50.410
This one I call "Ouch."

16:51.580 --> 16:53.196
That's her, not you.

16:53.198 --> 16:54.548
Oh, oh, the
purple ones.

16:54.550 --> 16:56.866
I couldn't remember where
I lived for a week.

16:56.868 --> 16:58.385
Knocked on every door
in the neighborhood,

16:58.387 --> 16:59.920
and not with my hand.

16:59.922 --> 17:02.205
And, Walden,

17:02.207 --> 17:03.890
this last one
I'm throwing in here, um,

17:03.892 --> 17:06.726
just take half of it,
because, technically,

17:06.728 --> 17:09.179
it's "only for horses."

17:09.181 --> 17:11.982
Don't... don't I need
a prescription for these?

17:11.983 --> 17:15.101
What are you, a cop?

17:15.103 --> 17:17.387
Don't worry,
Russell, he's cool.

17:17.388 --> 17:19.071
Okay, well,

17:19.074 --> 17:20.690
there you go.

17:20.692 --> 17:22.442
And since you're a friend
of a friend,

17:22.444 --> 17:25.612
I should read you
the possible side effects.

17:25.614 --> 17:27.998
"Headaches, dry mouth,
blurred vision, facial flushing,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.367
"inflamed bursa sac,
vertigo, fits of rage,

17:30.369 --> 17:31.751
"homicidal, patricidal,
matricidal

17:31.753 --> 17:33.837
"and suicidal thoughts,
stroke, anal leakage,

17:33.839 --> 17:36.373
"explosive diarrhea,
nipple discoloration, death,

17:36.375 --> 17:39.292
and difficulty
achieving an erection."

17:39.294 --> 17:41.261
Huh.

17:41.263 --> 17:43.597
That explains my
yellow nipples.

17:44.799 --> 17:46.516
You know what?

17:46.518 --> 17:49.719
Maybe I'll just go with
the basic little blue pill.

17:49.721 --> 17:52.755
Well, suit yourself, Sally.

17:52.757 --> 17:54.307
Here you go.

17:54.309 --> 17:55.692
Don't want these to go to waste.

17:55.694 --> 17:57.727
That little waitress
down at Ruby Tuesday's

17:57.729 --> 18:00.063
is never gonna know
what hit her.

18:03.284 --> 18:04.901
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

18:08.606 --> 18:10.790
Sam?

18:12.243 --> 18:13.827
What's going on?

18:13.829 --> 18:16.446
Guess who's back.

18:16.448 --> 18:17.797
Well, hello!

18:17.799 --> 18:19.949
I haven't seen you in a while.

18:19.951 --> 18:23.503
Hey, Kate, I've missed you.

18:24.890 --> 18:26.506
Okay, that's creepy.

18:26.508 --> 18:27.841
I'm gonna stop doing that.

18:27.843 --> 18:30.260
Good, because I can't stay

18:30.262 --> 18:32.812
and I wouldn't want you to think
it's because I wasn't enchanted

18:32.814 --> 18:34.397
by your talking penis.

18:34.399 --> 18:35.699
Where you going?

18:35.701 --> 18:37.651
I actually just came back
to grab some designs.

18:37.653 --> 18:39.903
Plus, I've got a million things
to do before I leave

18:39.905 --> 18:42.606
for New York tomorrow, but I
promise when I get back tonight,

18:42.608 --> 18:44.107
I will make it up to you.

18:44.109 --> 18:46.026
And you.

Bye.

18:47.329 --> 18:48.445
We'll be here.

18:51.749 --> 18:53.483
Hold me.

18:56.087 --> 18:57.654
Shut up.

18:57.656 --> 19:00.707
Come on,
we both know how this ends.

Are you sure
you don't want me

19:07.265 --> 19:08.882
to give you a ride
to the airport?

19:08.884 --> 19:10.600
No, Alan's
sending a limo.

19:10.602 --> 19:12.802
He's a class act.

19:12.804 --> 19:16.606
Yeah, I just... I just feel
like I should come with you.

19:16.608 --> 19:18.525
Sam, I would love
for you to come,

19:18.527 --> 19:20.777
but I just wouldn't feel right
spending Alan's money

19:20.779 --> 19:22.979
to fly my boyfriend
across the country.

19:22.981 --> 19:25.782
And it's not like
you or I have the money.

19:25.784 --> 19:28.151
What if I told you
I had plenty of money?

19:28.153 --> 19:31.738
I would ask you why you didn't
help me instead of Alan.

19:31.740 --> 19:34.524
That would be a fair question.

19:34.526 --> 19:37.460
Honey, you are so sweet.

19:37.462 --> 19:40.664
And hopefully one day,
money won't be an issue for us.

19:40.666 --> 19:42.799
Hope you're right.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.802
That's the car.

19:45.804 --> 19:47.203
I got to go.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.761
Um, good luck.

19:54.763 --> 19:56.479
I'll miss you.

19:56.481 --> 19:59.182
I love you, Sam.

My name is Walden Schmidt.

20:08.243 --> 20:10.527
I'm a billionaire.

20:10.529 --> 20:14.030
I love you, too.

I don't care what your name is.
