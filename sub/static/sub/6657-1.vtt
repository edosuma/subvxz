WEBVTT

02:58.279 --> 02:59.439
Hey.

02:59.614 --> 03:00.638
Hey, bitch.

03:13.728 --> 03:14.717
Hey.

03:16.064 --> 03:17.292
I'm gonna fuck you.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.902
- Touch it, slut.
- Jesus!

03:28.776 --> 03:29.765
See my dick.

03:31.112 --> 03:33.603
Guess what happened today, guys?

03:34.015 --> 03:36.313
Can any of you guess?

03:36.618 --> 03:38.609
The Yuens fucked up bigtime.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.346
Instead of watching the mall
like they're supposed to...

03:41.522 --> 03:45.117
...they let a damn pervert come and
show his fucking cock to around 15 people.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.818
So good job, guys. You fucked up big.

03:47.996 --> 03:49.463
Y'all hurt Ronnie.

03:49.631 --> 03:50.723
And nobody hurts Ronnie.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.225
Now apologize to me.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.791
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.492
Say that like you mean it.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.297
- Okay. We're sorry.
- I'm sorry.

03:57.472 --> 03:59.372
That sounded like the last one.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.442
- Guys, I need you to step it up.
- Okay.

04:03.611 --> 04:07.138
You two guys, if you want this,
if you wanna experience what this is...

04:07.315 --> 04:09.408
...I'm gonna need to see more
than I'm seeing.

04:09.584 --> 04:10.881
- You will.
- You will.

04:11.052 --> 04:12.644
Get the fuck out of my face, guys.

04:15.857 --> 04:17.084
Thank you. That was great.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.158
- It's my pleasure, man.
- That was awesome.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.317
I'm standing here at Forest Ridge Mall...

04:21.495 --> 04:25.227
...where today, a man exposed himself
to several women before fleeing the scene.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.233
I'm with Ronnie Barnhardt,
one of the security guards, who...

04:28.403 --> 04:31.930
No, cut. You fucked up, ma'am.
I'm the head of mall security.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.006
You should do that again, say it right.

04:34.175 --> 04:36.370
- Go ahead. Action.
- Well, Officer Barnhardt...

04:36.544 --> 04:40.275
Right. Is there any information
you can shed on this situation?

04:40.448 --> 04:43.440
You're just gonna keep going
even though you fucked up my title?

04:43.618 --> 04:44.846
Okay.

04:45.019 --> 04:46.953
Well, I'm standing here with this doctor.

05:09.544 --> 05:14.607
Okay, how do I steer you
towards the oil-free foundation?

05:14.782 --> 05:17.615
She was like, "Oh, no.
I didn't wanna moisturize."

05:17.785 --> 05:19.912
- I was like, "No!"
- Oh, moisturizer.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.985
Oh, shit.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.130
Oh, shit.

05:31.299 --> 05:32.698
What were you talking about?

05:32.867 --> 05:35.597
What were you...?
What were you saying to each other?

05:35.770 --> 05:39.672
So, Ronnie,
what is it, um, you stopped by for?

05:39.841 --> 05:41.638
Well, I'm sure you heard about this...

05:42.410 --> 05:46.107
...but we had a pervert sexually assault
several women in the mall parking lot.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.305
Oh, really? A pervert?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.176
Yeah.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.615
So I just thought I'd tell you,
just be careful...

05:52.787 --> 05:55.312
...watching your comings
and your goings and whatnot.

05:55.490 --> 05:59.517
- Do you think we're gonna be safe?
- Yeah, Bruce, I think you'll be just fine.

06:00.061 --> 06:02.256
Bruce wants to know if he'll be safe.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.188
I should warn the pervert
that Bruce is out there.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.667
Look at me, I'm Bruce. Look.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.667
Is the pervert gonna get me?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.533
I'm just fucking with you, Bruce.

06:12.707 --> 06:16.143
I think, Ronnie, that I am...
I'm gonna be just fine.

06:16.310 --> 06:20.110
Everyone thinks they're fine till someone
puts something in them they don't want.

06:20.681 --> 06:24.742
Okay, well,
I guess it's probably time to

06:25.753 --> 06:29.689
Okay, well, see you guys.
Have fun doing your thing.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.552
Alrighty.

06:32.326 --> 06:35.625
What? Oh, okay.
I thought I heard you.

06:44.038 --> 06:46.734
You talk to Mark
about lifting that firearms restriction?

06:46.908 --> 06:50.469
Oh, yeah, we should be good soon,
but technically, it's still pending.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.977
- The AS50 just came out.
- No way.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.310
Semi-auto, five rounds,
removable magazine.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.918
Thirty-three inches long.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.078
I mean, it'd be perfect for, you know,
the back of the golf cart.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.318
The new model 1216 carries 20 rounds
of 12-gauge shotgun shells.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.658
Wait. It holds 20 rounds?
I thought it was 18.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.460
- No, 20.
- You're confirming it's 20?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.760
Yes, I'm confirming 20.

07:14.936 --> 07:16.164
That's confirmed. Yes.

07:21.175 --> 07:25.703
Well, guys, we got Tasers, we got Mace.
It's not bad.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.280
- I guess that'll have to do for now, huh?
- Maybe.

07:28.449 --> 07:32.044
Yeah, still, it'd be so much cooler
if we were able to carry guns.

07:32.220 --> 07:34.188
Carrying a gun to work is, like, the best.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.271
<i> I would like to deliver
a personal message...</i>

07:52.440 --> 07:53.964
<i>... to this perverted individual.</i>

07:54.141 --> 07:55.438
<i>Nice sucker punch today.</i>

07:55.610 --> 07:59.068
<i>You show up again, and you see
what the * * * * happens, okay?</i>

07:59.247 --> 08:00.475
<i>I will murder you!</i>

08:00.648 --> 08:02.980
<i>I will * * * * * * * murder you!</i>

08:03.150 --> 08:05.175
<i>- No comment was made...
- You're * * * * * * * dead!</i>

08:05.353 --> 08:08.151
<i>No comment was made
as to the identity of the assailant...</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:12.850
<i>- ... but we will keep you posted.
- I use Mace and Tasers. * * * * you.</i>

08:13.694 --> 08:18.529
Ronnie, I am so proud of you.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.894
- You really think I did good?
- Hell, yes.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.399
You're just, you're...

08:23.871 --> 08:27.534
You're just... Fuck, you're great. Great.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.075
- You're just drunk, Mom.
- No, no.

08:31.245 --> 08:35.773
You did good. You scared me.
You were scary.

08:46.227 --> 08:47.990
You know, Mom...

08:48.629 --> 08:51.120
...I got a confession to make.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.130
It might sound bad, but...

08:55.469 --> 08:57.960
...part of me thinks
that this disgusting pervert...

08:58.139 --> 09:00.505
...is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

09:00.675 --> 09:04.475
I mean, this is a real case.
This is my chance just to be great.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.978
I swear on my soul
I'm gonna catch this guy.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.143
I'm gonna get him.

09:16.357 --> 09:17.790
Oh, I'm tired.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.979
Good night, Mom. Love you.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.195
Ronnie Barnhardt,
head of security here in the mall.

09:57.365 --> 10:00.994
I noticed your sign. I'd like to claim
one of your free cups of coffee, please.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.760
Let me just get that for you.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.440
Thank you very much.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.848
So are you new here?
I don't remember someone...

10:17.284 --> 10:20.082
...with a leg working here.
- Yeah. I just started last week.

10:20.254 --> 10:23.781
Then I had to get ankle surgery, so...
I have a protein deficiency.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.152
Oh, wow.

10:25.326 --> 10:29.854
Could you keep your traffic area clear?

10:30.031 --> 10:32.556
- Sorry.
- Always.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.896
I disagree with his methods,
but that is a fire hazard.

10:36.404 --> 10:37.894
Is there really a pervert here?

10:38.072 --> 10:39.630
Yes. Yes, ma'am, there is.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.933
That's scary.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.575
Not for me so much, you know.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.076
It's actually kind of my job
to put myself in harm's way...

10:46.247 --> 10:50.206
...to protect weaker people such as yourself
who are crippled in the leg and whatnot.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.113
My cast is coming off in a month.

10:52.286 --> 10:55.380
I do it
so other people can sleep well at night.

10:55.556 --> 10:58.024
Meanwhile, I'm up all night
fighting demons.

10:58.192 --> 11:03.095
Just screaming bloody murder,
waking up with nosebleeds, night terrors.

11:03.264 --> 11:06.165
Finding myself a mile from home
with bloody feet and a gun.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.359
I have no idea how I got there,
but pound for pound, I'd say...

11:09.537 --> 11:13.303
...there's not one human being that
deserves this coffee as much as myself.

11:13.474 --> 11:14.498
Wow.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.940
Be seeing you around, get more of this,
maybe a free cinnamon bun or something.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.773
I'll be here.

11:20.648 --> 11:21.842
Stay safe, ma'am.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.269
Touch Daddy's dick.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.041
It was horrible.

11:57.485 --> 12:01.478
It just keeps playing over and over
in my head.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.419
Like, someone press stop.

12:04.592 --> 12:07.026
It's on repeat.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.354
Are you okay, Brandi?

12:08.529 --> 12:11.054
Physically, yes.

12:11.232 --> 12:15.225
Psychologically, no!

12:15.402 --> 12:18.667
Brandi. Brandi!

12:19.140 --> 12:20.334
Perimeter.

12:20.508 --> 12:23.204
Are you okay?
Jesus Christ, I came as soon as I heard.

12:23.377 --> 12:26.278
I'm so sorry. Out of everyone,
I should've been protecting you.

12:26.447 --> 12:28.540
Look, this is not your fault.

12:28.716 --> 12:32.152
Ronnie, get her to my office
so the police can talk to her in private.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.150
Roger. No problem. Let's go, Brandi.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.619
I obviously can't walk.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.018
I'm in shock.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.558
Okay. Of course you are.

12:40.728 --> 12:42.025
You don't have to walk.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.158
Okay.

12:50.171 --> 12:53.834
Oh, my back. Fuck. Come on.

13:11.492 --> 13:12.857
Detective. Detective.

13:13.027 --> 13:15.928
Can you give us a statement
as to the identity of the pervert?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.427
No comment.

13:17.598 --> 13:20.192
Just stay with me, Brandi.
Just, look, stay with me.

13:20.701 --> 13:23.397
I know it was horrible.
Just don't think about his penis.

13:24.872 --> 13:28.933
Hi. Your secretary told me to come in.
I'm Detective Harrison, Conway Police.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.770
Mark Peoples, I manage the mall.

13:30.945 --> 13:33.607
This is Brandi.
She's the one who saw the deviant.

13:33.781 --> 13:36.113
Hi, Brandi. How you doing? You okay?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.614
I'm pretty shaken up.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.077
- Brandi...
- Mm-hm?

13:40.254 --> 13:42.882
...I'm here to tell you
that we're gonna work together...

13:43.057 --> 13:45.184
...to make sure we catch the guy
that did this.

13:45.359 --> 13:47.919
- Okay.
- Ronnie Barnhardt.

13:48.095 --> 13:51.189
Head of mall security,
chief inspector on the case.

13:51.365 --> 13:53.799
This is my lieutenant, Dennis.

13:53.968 --> 13:55.162
Hey, gentlemen.

13:55.336 --> 13:57.304
- Did you get a look at the guy?
- Yes.

13:57.471 --> 13:59.063
Do you remember anything specific?

13:59.240 --> 14:02.334
Was he tall, short, black, white,
color of hair?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.841
- He was white.
- Okay.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.843
Tall.

14:07.248 --> 14:09.739
Chubby and blond.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.545
- Like pretty blond or?
- Sandy, ugly blond.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.778
Oh, he had ugly blond.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.922
I think this is good enough for now.

14:16.090 --> 14:18.285
All right? The best thing to do
at this point...

14:18.459 --> 14:20.859
...is I'm gonna go talk to the other ladies
who saw the guy...

14:21.028 --> 14:22.962
- Ha!
- What? Now what?

14:23.130 --> 14:25.360
Aren't you embarrassed saying that?
Like a cop.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.500
It's paperwork. It's procedures.

14:27.668 --> 14:30.159
What I wanna know
is who's gonna protect Brandi.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.703
It's clear to me
that she's been targeted here.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.103
Why say that?
What gives you that impression?

14:35.276 --> 14:38.575
A, she's the prettiest girl in this entire mall
and maybe the world.

14:38.746 --> 14:44.048
B, it's clear that this pervert
is some kind of sociopathic genius...

14:44.218 --> 14:48.018
...who plans on coming back and finishing
what he started, by murdering Brandi.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.347
Oh, my God. Is that gonna happen?

14:51.525 --> 14:53.459
- It's gonna happen.
- No, it's not.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.185
- He's gonna murder you.
No.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.954
- My God.
- It's not gonna happen.

14:57.131 --> 14:58.291
- Am I gonna die?
- No, no.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.693
- You gonna die.
No.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.357
I have to get going, okay?

15:01.535 --> 15:04.299
I'm gonna give you my card.
Call me when you aren't working.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.031
Come to the station
and we'll go through some mug shots.

15:07.708 --> 15:10.040
Don't worry. All right?

15:10.210 --> 15:14.476
Look, your hair's all messy.
I'll talk to you soon.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.184
Thanks, detective.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.717
I feel a lot better.

15:20.554 --> 15:23.614
Yeah, we all feel a lot better.
Thanks a lot, detective.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.918
All right, have a nice day.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.559
One question.
What the fuck was that, Mark?

15:30.731 --> 15:32.198
What are you talking about?

15:32.366 --> 15:36.769
You're gonna let some fucking hotshot punk
come in here and take my fucking case?

15:36.937 --> 15:39.531
I just want this to be over
as soon as possible, okay?

15:39.707 --> 15:43.234
I'm beginning to feel goddamn
underappreciated around here, you sellout.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.537
- Damn!
- Okay.

15:45.713 --> 15:50.673
This is my case. Not yours. Not his.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.076
Mine.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.550
Okay, so everybody, listen up, okay?

15:54.722 --> 15:56.587
Ronnie has a very important
announcement.

15:56.757 --> 15:59.851
It's been a tough day for him.
It's been tough on his spirit.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.222
So everybody, just be very respectful.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.795
Thank you, Dennis.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.491
Listen, you are all under strict orders...

16:07.668 --> 16:10.933
...to do everything in your power
to bring down this pervert.

16:11.105 --> 16:13.767
You are to report to me and only me...

16:13.941 --> 16:18.537
...but most importantly, you do not
say a word about this to the police.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.373
Okay? Forget the police.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.775
I'm in charge of this.

16:21.949 --> 16:25.112
Ronnie. You know,
I've gotta get back to work soon...

16:25.285 --> 16:27.549
...because I'm technically employed
by O'Landers.

16:27.721 --> 16:31.680
Kid's not even officially on the team yet
and he thinks he's got it all figured out.

16:31.859 --> 16:35.852
Here's how this is gonna break down.
Dennis, you're my second in command.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.462
You're my right-hand man.

16:37.631 --> 16:40.099
Thank you very much.
I've always wanted that position.

16:40.267 --> 16:44.897
But I didn't wanna put the extra pressure
on our friendship, so thank you so much.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.596
- You're welcome.
- Okay.

16:46.774 --> 16:50.403
Yuens, you guys are my infantry.
You're expendable.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.444
One of you dies,
God gave me another one.

16:53.614 --> 16:54.740
- Okay, okay.
- Awesome.

16:54.915 --> 16:58.442
Charles, your position
is that of a student.

16:59.253 --> 17:01.483
Are we gonna be getting paid extra
for this?

17:01.655 --> 17:05.819
Because it seems
like this is completely separate from...

17:05.992 --> 17:07.550
Let me ask you something.

17:07.728 --> 17:09.787
How much did they get paid
to storm Normandy?

17:09.963 --> 17:12.396
How much did King Arthur get paid
to kill Merlin?

17:12.566 --> 17:14.897
How much did they get paid
to invent television?

17:15.068 --> 17:18.265
Nothing.
They did it because they knew it was right.

17:18.439 --> 17:21.567
Now everyone put your hands in
for a unifying cheer.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.805
Looking at you, Charles.

17:23.977 --> 17:28.209
This is a lot for me to take in. And I'm just...
I'm not sure that I'm up for this.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.713
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.044
- It's just that I usually... Stop...
- Shh, shh, shh.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.948
- Use my strength.
- What?

17:37.891 --> 17:40.485
On three. One, two, three.

17:40.661 --> 17:43.824
Special Elite Task Force.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.229
Fuck!

18:55.402 --> 18:56.892
Guys, all this is evidence.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.595
Bag it and tag it, get it to my office.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.968
I'm Detective Harrison
with the Conway Police...

19:02.142 --> 19:04.372
...and I need
to ask you a few questions, okay?

19:04.545 --> 19:06.945
Noticed anything suspicious
going on around here?

19:07.114 --> 19:10.641
Someone hanging around the place
that you've never seen before...

19:10.817 --> 19:13.615
...what we call casing the place? No?
- Not really.

19:13.787 --> 19:16.449
What about co-workers?
Any disgruntled employees?

19:16.623 --> 19:19.558
Someone who might've been complaining
excessively about the job?

19:19.726 --> 19:22.718
- No more than usual.
- Yeah. No, I hear that.

19:22.896 --> 19:26.730
- All right, good, good. Thank you, Sarah.
- One second, chief.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.061
Ronnie Barnhardt.
Who robbed the shoe store?

19:29.236 --> 19:32.296
- I need you to wait out in the hallway.
- I don't know who did it.

19:32.472 --> 19:36.067
Harrison seems to be too blinded
by your beauty to ask the right questions.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.574
Who robbed the shoe store?

19:37.744 --> 19:40.838
- Who the fuck robbed this shoe store?
That's okay.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.505
Sarah, thank you for your help.
I appreciate it. Okay?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.479
<i>Que pasa, Ramon?</i>

19:59.199 --> 20:00.757
<i>- Si.
What?</i>

20:00.934 --> 20:02.902
This guy fucking did it.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.766
- Well, what'd he say?
- I don't know. I don't speak Spanish.

20:05.939 --> 20:10.308
But you look at his face, his inflections,
the tone of his voice. Look at his eyes.

20:14.915 --> 20:15.939
<i>I know who did it.</i>

20:16.116 --> 20:17.845
- You do, do you?
- Yeah.

20:18.018 --> 20:20.384
- Big time.
- All right, who did it, Ronnie?

20:20.921 --> 20:23.389
- Check it out.
- I have sensual salts available also.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.024
- Do you know what those are?
- No.

20:25.192 --> 20:29.993
That's for when you take a bubble bath,
you cover your little breasts with bubbles.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.324
Excuse me.
Detective Harrison, Conway Police.

20:32.499 --> 20:36.560
Oh, shit. Yeah, I wasn't touching her
in a bad way or anything. Yeah, it was just...

20:36.737 --> 20:39.638
Somebody robbed the shoe store.
Asking if anybody noticed anything.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.707
All right, you need to get the fuck
out of here. Let's move.

20:42.876 --> 20:46.368
Noticed any suspicious characters?
Looked like they were casing the place?

20:46.546 --> 20:48.036
- Anything like that?
- No.

20:48.215 --> 20:49.512
What's up, Saddamn?

20:49.683 --> 20:52.880
- What do you want, Ronnie?
- I want you to face the fucking music.

20:53.053 --> 20:56.545
I have a restraining order against you,
so take this opportunity to back up.

20:57.024 --> 20:59.925
- Come on, let's go.
- You're fucking my case up, Harrison.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.153
You said you had proof.
He's got a restraining order against you?

21:03.330 --> 21:05.628
Look at him. That's all the proof I need.

21:05.799 --> 21:06.993
That's racist, man.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.226
Nothing to do with this.
You fit the profile.

21:09.403 --> 21:12.270
- Like for the pervert.
- How do I know you're not the pervert?

21:12.439 --> 21:14.339
My dick is brown,
you dumb motherfucker!

21:14.508 --> 21:16.635
- Let's go.
- You should arrest this clown.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.040
He comes here
and harasses me like every day.

21:19.212 --> 21:22.943
Last week he tells me that he's discovered
my plot to blow up the Chick-fil-A.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.710
Why would I blow up Chick-fil-A?
It's fucking delicious.

21:25.886 --> 21:28.150
- I'll go, I'll go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.551
But I tell you,
I got your fucking number...

21:30.724 --> 21:34.125
...so you should know that I know
that you did that shit.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.195
- Fuck you, Ronnie.
- Fuck you.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.626
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.164
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.062
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.702
- Fuck you, Ronnie.
- Fuck you.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.395
- Fuck you, Ronnie.
- Fuck you, Saddam Hussein of Iraq.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.473
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

21:49.009 --> 21:50.408
Fuck you.

21:51.578 --> 21:54.103
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

21:54.281 --> 21:56.647
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

21:56.817 --> 21:57.875
Fuck you.

21:58.051 --> 22:00.144
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.250
<i>Fuck you.</i>

22:02.422 --> 22:05.789
<i>Fuck you.</i>

22:06.226 --> 22:09.389
Hey. Yeah, how's it going?
I got a question for you. Okay.

22:09.563 --> 22:11.463
So I bought this,
like, two and a half weeks ago.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.762
- Yeah. And bought...
Good afternoon, Forest Ridge Mall.

22:16.069 --> 22:18.469
So did you find anything?

22:19.172 --> 22:21.640
I found out quite a bit, actually.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.105
Like what?

22:23.276 --> 22:26.143
A few clues, nice little list of suspects...

22:27.013 --> 22:29.106
...and, I think, the answer
to the whole case.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.147
We didn't find anything.

22:31.318 --> 22:35.414
Also found out
that Detective Harrison over here...

22:35.589 --> 22:39.184
...not quite the detective
he makes himself out to be.

22:39.359 --> 22:43.352
Also, interesting news, not really
enough room for two cooks in this kitchen.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.589
- You're not a cook.
- I'm a cook.

22:45.766 --> 22:47.028
And I'm serving up justice.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.690
You're a security guard.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.496
Hot plates of justice.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.103
That's it, you motherfucker!

22:52.272 --> 22:54.672
All day, I'm listening to your bullshit!

22:54.841 --> 22:57.639
We didn't find anything today
because of you!

22:57.811 --> 23:01.042
You fucked up my investigation
and you wasted my time!

23:01.214 --> 23:02.977
I gotta come back to this shithole...

23:03.150 --> 23:06.381
...to interview the people
who might've actually done the crime!

23:06.553 --> 23:10.353
I hate you!
I hate you so much, you fucking faggot!

23:10.524 --> 23:13.220
And news flash,
you're a fucking rent-a-cop!

23:13.393 --> 23:16.829
You might think you're a real cop,
but you're not! You know why?

23:16.997 --> 23:20.057
Because you're a fucking retard!

23:33.380 --> 23:35.940
Use your inside voice, you know?

23:36.183 --> 23:37.650
We can all hear.

23:57.671 --> 24:00.265
- Is this the recruitment office?
- It sure is.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.238
- Come on in, take a seat.
- Okay.

24:04.578 --> 24:06.136
How can I help you?

24:06.313 --> 24:08.008
I was actually looking to inquire...

24:08.181 --> 24:11.548
...as to exactly what it takes
to become a police officer like yourself.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.948
Are you interested in joining the force?

24:14.120 --> 24:17.681
I'm just kind of curious, mostly. Why?
Do you see something in me?

24:17.858 --> 24:20.725
There are several steps
to be eligible for the academy.

24:20.894 --> 24:21.918
Lay them on me.

24:22.095 --> 24:23.426
- Physical evaluation.
- Done.

24:23.597 --> 24:25.087
- Psychological tests.
- Easy.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.096
- And a background check.
- Boom.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.594
If someone's interested,
I usually recommend a ride-along first.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.431
- A ride-along?
- That's right.

24:32.606 --> 24:35.871
It's where you ride along
with a real police officer during patrol.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.738
Ask a question, get an answer.
You got a hell of a system.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.709
- Thank you.
- Lf you're interested...

24:40.881 --> 24:46.046
...I can give you the forms to take home so
you can get that background check started.

24:51.858 --> 24:52.882
- Okay.
- Cool.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.117
All right. Let's do it.

24:54.294 --> 24:57.627
Yeah, I might as well
just take those now.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.890
Probably won't even fill them out.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.431
- Here you go.
- Perfect.

25:30.230 --> 25:32.755
- Morning, Nell.
- Hey, Ronnie.

25:32.933 --> 25:35.663
- Cream and sugar, right?
- That's right.

25:39.739 --> 25:43.971
I don't mean to insult you. Did you
do something different with the coffee?

25:44.144 --> 25:46.704
- No. It's same as always.
- Different roast?

25:47.347 --> 25:50.680
- You want me to make you a new one?
- No, no, it's okay.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.613
It's a little different, I guess.

25:52.786 --> 25:56.278
Probably feel weird. I filled out
those police application forms last night.

25:56.456 --> 25:58.321
Probably just threw me off a bit.

25:58.692 --> 26:01.889
- You applying to be a police officer?
- Did I say that out loud? Yeah.

26:02.329 --> 26:04.024
Totally slipped out.

26:04.197 --> 26:06.961
Don't tell anyone.
I don't really want it getting out there.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.327
- I won't.
- Okay.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.332
But you should know that there's no shame
in going after your dreams.

26:12.505 --> 26:17.067
Few people do it and you should keep doing
it, no matter how many people laugh at you.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.336
Who's laughing at me?
No one laughs at me.

26:19.512 --> 26:22.003
I laugh at other idiots
trying to do what they want.

26:22.182 --> 26:25.948
No one laughs at me for trying to do,
you know, my destiny.

26:26.119 --> 26:27.347
That's not how this works.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.216
- Sorry about that.
- Save your sorries for someone sad.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.784
Put your sorries in a sack and give them
to someone who needs them.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.360
Not me.

26:38.098 --> 26:41.727
See you later, Nell. Thanks for this.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.575
I'll catch you guys later.

26:49.743 --> 26:51.836
We'll meet at the usual.

26:55.215 --> 26:57.274
That's fucked up.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.917
- Hello, Detective Harrison.
- Whoa!

27:02.088 --> 27:03.783
What the fuck?

27:03.957 --> 27:06.585
You scared the shit out of me, Ronnie.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.422
What are you...?
What the fuck are you doing here?

27:09.596 --> 27:13.293
I'm here for my ride-along, you know?
I figure you can come into the mall...

27:13.466 --> 27:17.334
...you can try to steal my shine, it's only
fair I get to do the same to you, man.

27:17.504 --> 27:20.337
Ronnie, I need you
to get the fuck out of the car now.

27:20.507 --> 27:23.670
No can do.
Every citizen is allowed a ride-along.

27:23.843 --> 27:28.473
I am well within my rights, plus I've taken
the liberty of clearing this with the captain.

27:28.648 --> 27:32.345
So here's the part where I tell you
that payback's a bitch...

27:32.519 --> 27:36.580
...and the only thing really left to say
after that is "boom."

27:37.257 --> 27:39.418
- Wanna see what I do?
- I'd love nothing more...

27:39.592 --> 27:42.288
...than to see what you think you do.
- I'll show you.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.062
Come on.

27:56.643 --> 27:58.474
What is this? Hey, hey, hey.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.714
- See that corner there, Ronnie?
- Yeah, I see it.

28:07.887 --> 28:12.051
That corner? It used to be
the worst corner in this whole city.

28:12.225 --> 28:13.817
It was nicknamed "the Crossroads."

28:13.993 --> 28:15.961
Oh, shit. I've actually heard of that.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.359
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

28:18.531 --> 28:22.297
Myself and the other officers,
we worked for years on cleaning it up.

28:22.469 --> 28:27.133
It hasn't been easy. I mean, we still patrol
the area to keep our presence up.

28:27.307 --> 28:29.400
I use the same technique in the mall.

28:29.576 --> 28:30.600
I'm sure you do.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.476
I usually do the foot patrols myself.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.347
I'm gonna let you do it tonight.

28:38.952 --> 28:42.479
You know, Ronnie,
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.616
This is my way of making it up to you.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.020
What do you say?

28:48.094 --> 28:51.188
I mean, honestly, I'm touched.

28:51.364 --> 28:55.494
That's really, really nice of you. That's...
I'd love to. It'd be an honor, sir.

28:55.668 --> 28:56.965
I won't let you down.

28:57.137 --> 28:59.105
- You ready?
- I'm ready. I'll get to it.

28:59.272 --> 29:01.137
- Go get them.
- Okay.

29:15.989 --> 29:17.422
Hey, where you going?

29:17.857 --> 29:18.983
Hey, Harrison.

29:19.626 --> 29:22.527
Harrison, where are you...? Harrison!

29:23.363 --> 29:26.127
Harrison!

29:27.700 --> 29:29.861
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

29:36.676 --> 29:39.076
What the fuck am I doing?

29:41.114 --> 29:44.572
All right, kids, no horseplay.
Get on home. It's late.

29:44.751 --> 29:47.242
Hey, player,
you looking for that crack?

29:47.420 --> 29:49.888
Am I looking for that crack?

29:50.056 --> 29:51.523
As in crack cocaine?

29:51.991 --> 29:55.654
You just offered to sell me
a schedule one narcotic. That's a felony.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.921
That's five to 10 years. Boom!

29:58.097 --> 30:00.190
- You're under citizen's arrest.
- No, let go!

30:00.366 --> 30:02.266
- I will not let you go!
- Fuck you!

30:02.435 --> 30:04.426
You're gonna learn things in jail.

30:04.604 --> 30:07.937
Gotta wait for my partner to get back.
Should be any second.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.871
- Get your hands off him.
- What?

30:11.044 --> 30:12.978
You heard me.
That's my son, motherfucker.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.238
What? This little guy?

30:14.414 --> 30:16.279
This is my motherfucking seed right here.

30:16.449 --> 30:19.282
- See, I got him on my motherfucking chest.
- I see that.

30:19.452 --> 30:21.647
Ain't just gonna tattoo
any motherfucker on my chest!

30:22.055 --> 30:24.888
This is my lifeline, my legacy.

30:25.291 --> 30:29.455
Well, I hate to be the one to break this
to you, because you seem to love him.

30:29.862 --> 30:32.422
It seems your son just tried
to sell me an illegal drug.

30:32.599 --> 30:35.227
- Rico just tried to sell you some drugs?
- Yeah.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.232
That's some crazy shit.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.598
- Ain't that some crazy shit?
- That's crazy, man.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.501
That's not too crazy though...

30:41.808 --> 30:45.244
...because he works for me,
you stupid motherfucker.

30:45.411 --> 30:50.110
More bad news. You're gonna need to find
a new employee. I'm taking him downtown.

30:50.283 --> 30:53.411
Oh, for real? Well, you gonna need
to find a new motherfucking head.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.816
You're right. You're free to go, kid.

30:55.989 --> 30:58.184
Good luck with the crack.
Have a good life.

30:58.358 --> 31:01.521
Yeah. Get home, Rico.
Do your motherfucking homework.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.321
Rico! Get home!

31:03.496 --> 31:05.123
So I'll catch you later. Thank you.

31:05.298 --> 31:08.165
- Waste him, Tone.
- Motherfucker, don't tell me what to do.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.962
How many motherfuckers have you killed?
None.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.866
I've killed two, so shut the fuck up.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.066
Don't do it, okay?

31:15.241 --> 31:17.175
- Oh, God, don't.
- You gonna start crying?

31:17.343 --> 31:19.311
- Just don't do it.
- Look at little bitch.

31:19.479 --> 31:21.037
This was a mistake. Don't do it.

31:21.214 --> 31:25.344
You know what I should do?
I should make you suck this gun like a dick.

31:25.518 --> 31:29.614
And when it comes, it's gonna blow
your brains all over the street.

31:30.790 --> 31:33.759
- Look in your heart.
- Pop a cap in his ass, right now.

31:33.926 --> 31:37.157
I don't believe it. Are you
gonna seriously sit here and talk to me?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.321
- I'm just saying.
- You're just saying what?

32:06.693 --> 32:09.526
I cannot believe you took him
to the fucking Crossroads.

32:09.696 --> 32:10.890
I mean, that's ridiculous.

32:11.064 --> 32:14.363
You'd have done the same. Bad enough
I had to spend the day with him...

32:14.534 --> 32:16.024
...now he's at my fucking job?

32:16.202 --> 32:18.500
Yeah, but, well,
he's probably gonna get killed.

32:18.671 --> 32:21.265
Good, I hope he does get killed.
Fuck him. I don't care.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.636
I'm telling you, I hate this guy.
I hate him more than...

32:24.977 --> 32:28.105
Sit the fuck down. Do you hear me?
You sit the fuck down!

32:28.281 --> 32:30.044
Don't fucking talk back to me!

32:32.418 --> 32:35.251
That's what the fuck I thought,
you little asshole.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.753
You. I know what you did.

32:38.524 --> 32:42.051
You set me up. You left me out there.
That's all there is to it. Admit it.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.627
Yeah.

32:44.097 --> 32:46.065
I set you up.

32:46.599 --> 32:49.159
What are you gonna do about it,
huh, Ronald?

32:49.335 --> 32:52.133
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna thank you.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.539
What are you talking about?

32:54.707 --> 32:59.269
I knew you wanted to see if I had the chops
to become a police officer. I did it, man.

32:59.445 --> 33:02.414
I did it. There are six dead crackheads
that can confirm that.

33:02.582 --> 33:06.245
Thank you. From the bottom of my heart,
thank you for believing in me.

33:06.419 --> 33:10.219
- I don't know what to say, Ronnie.
- No, shh. Don't say anything.

33:10.390 --> 33:13.757
Your actions,
they say more than words ever could.

33:13.926 --> 33:18.920
I always wanted to be a cop.
I didn't want to admit it, but you knew.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.864
You knew.

33:22.235 --> 33:23.566
Okay.

33:24.137 --> 33:25.502
I need more.

33:39.218 --> 33:42.210
Get used to seeing Ronnie Barnhardt
around here.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.561
Boom! Fuck you.

33:49.729 --> 33:51.162
<i>Cadets, ready.</i>

34:24.063 --> 34:25.530
- Move.
- Ah!

35:24.423 --> 35:26.755
- Fuck!
- Where you running, girl?

35:26.926 --> 35:28.723
You scared the shit out of me!

35:29.529 --> 35:32.089
You want a ride to your car
or what, huh?

35:34.534 --> 35:36.934
Well, move over.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.208
Brandi.

35:45.378 --> 35:49.576
Brandi, Brandi, Brandi.

35:50.283 --> 35:53.047
Okay, Brandi,
I'm gonna lay out a scenario for you.

35:53.219 --> 35:56.746
You, me, free dinner.

35:56.923 --> 36:00.222
You fill in the rest
with the answer "yes."

36:01.727 --> 36:03.319
There's my car.

36:03.896 --> 36:06.296
- Huh? What?
- Where are you going?

36:06.465 --> 36:08.228
What? Sorry, someone cut the brakes.

36:08.401 --> 36:11.302
- Oh, my God.
- I can't stop. I'm just joking.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.462
I can stop, but I'm not going to
unless you go to dinner with me.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.234
Someone better tell me
what they wanna eat for dinner.

36:17.410 --> 36:20.243
Fine, motherfucker!
All right, pick me up next Friday night.

36:20.613 --> 36:21.637
It's a date.

36:21.814 --> 36:24.248
No, it's not a fucking date.
Just don't tell anybody.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.290
- Don't.
- You don't.

36:34.694 --> 36:36.093
Listen, okay? I've told you...

36:36.262 --> 36:39.322
...if you're gonna sit up here,
you gotta keep this counter clean.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.329
I know. I can't reach that far.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.468
"I can't reach that far
because of my thing.

36:43.636 --> 36:47.572
If only I had a stick or something
that would extend my reach...

36:47.740 --> 36:51.301
...like the eight stick-like objects
that are behind this counter."

36:51.477 --> 36:53.877
- Think outside the box.
- I'm so sorry, Roger.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.913
- I'm gonna do better. I'm sorry.
- Oh, two sorries, l...

36:57.083 --> 37:01.543
Oh, I thought those
would clean the counter, but they don't...

37:01.721 --> 37:04.849
...because I guess I'm fucking dumb.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.589
Cup of joe, please.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.694
Hey, Ronnie.

37:11.931 --> 37:13.626
Is something wrong?

37:13.799 --> 37:15.664
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.533
I notice you wear a ring on your finger.
Are you married?

37:22.708 --> 37:24.403
This ring? No, I'm not married.

37:25.011 --> 37:26.035
I'm married to God.

37:26.212 --> 37:29.545
It just means that I'm waiting for marriage
before I'm with a man.

37:29.715 --> 37:32.684
- So you're a virgin?
- Technically, I'm a born-again virgin.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.446
I mean,
we've all been to beach week, right?

37:39.792 --> 37:41.521
I mean, so, yeah, I'm a virgin again.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.291
Why do you ask?

37:43.462 --> 37:45.487
Oh, no reason. Um...

37:45.798 --> 37:47.129
Well, actually...

37:47.299 --> 37:50.860
...I got kind of a hot date tonight
with Brandi over at the makeup counter.

37:51.037 --> 37:54.768
So I thought if you were married, you
might have some insight into relationships.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.875
You could maybe tell me
what I should wear on a date...

37:58.044 --> 37:59.705
...but you know what? Never mind.

37:59.879 --> 38:02.006
What you just said is kind of weird...

38:03.015 --> 38:06.917
...and I don't really think you're the best
person to be giving me advice on this...

38:07.086 --> 38:09.054
...so, yeah.

38:09.221 --> 38:10.518
Yeah, you're probably right.

38:10.690 --> 38:11.918
It's been a while. Sorry.

38:12.091 --> 38:14.423
But coffee's delicious.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.458
You should get married to this.

38:16.629 --> 38:18.096
Okay, well, thank you.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.160
No problem.

38:21.267 --> 38:23.735
- Hey, Ronnie?
- Yeah?

38:23.903 --> 38:26.064
I think you should dress like yourself.

38:27.640 --> 38:32.236
Yeah. Again, like I said, not the best person
to be giving advice on this, so...

38:34.113 --> 38:36.081
Come on, Ronnie. Just get out here.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.876
- It's too tight in the butt.
- Well, let me see.

38:43.556 --> 38:45.717
Ronnie.

38:45.891 --> 38:49.622
You look so handsome.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.457
You don't think I look like a phony?

38:52.631 --> 38:55.065
Heavens, no.

38:55.234 --> 38:59.466
This girl's gonna be knocked
on her socks.

39:00.106 --> 39:03.974
- It's kind of a cool outfit, I guess, right?
- Way cool.

39:04.143 --> 39:07.044
This girl must be really special.

39:07.213 --> 39:09.408
Oh, God, she is, Mom.

39:09.582 --> 39:12.142
She's the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

39:13.486 --> 39:18.116
You know, I remember when your father
picked me up for our first date...

39:18.657 --> 39:23.594
...I swear, he was the most handsome man
I'd ever laid eyes on.

39:23.996 --> 39:29.093
I knew right then and there
that I would fuck him that night...

39:29.268 --> 39:31.133
...and end up marrying him.

39:34.006 --> 39:36.668
I sure hope that happens to me tonight.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.707
Oh, it will, Ronnie.

39:38.878 --> 39:40.903
I just know it.

39:42.248 --> 39:43.715
Mom?

39:44.817 --> 39:46.910
Why did Dad leave?

39:47.620 --> 39:49.087
Well...

39:49.255 --> 39:52.383
...he kind of freaked out
when you were born.

39:52.825 --> 39:56.056
I mean, you had so many special needs...

39:56.228 --> 40:00.426
...and he just couldn't
handle the pressure.

40:00.599 --> 40:03.329
One day,
he just couldn't take it anymore.

40:04.804 --> 40:07.864
Do you think it was my fault
that Dad left?

40:09.408 --> 40:11.399
Definitely.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.949
I love you, Ronnie.

40:18.117 --> 40:20.142
I love you too, Mom.

40:36.202 --> 40:38.500
- You guys are hysterical.
Let me out!

40:40.072 --> 40:41.505
See you later, sweet tits.

40:41.674 --> 40:43.301
Fuck you, Tyler.

40:44.310 --> 40:45.937
God.

40:46.345 --> 40:47.903
Why, hello.

40:49.582 --> 40:51.743
What are you doing here?

40:51.917 --> 40:53.782
We were supposed to have dinner
tonight.

40:54.353 --> 40:56.116
- I forgot.
- That's okay.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.585
- I didn't.
- Yeah.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.384
Well, it's pretty late.

41:00.559 --> 41:04.427
I made several dinner reservations,
so we'll get a table no matter what.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.758
Well, I gotta pee first.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.401
Okay.

41:11.604 --> 41:15.096
You want me to come? Should...?
Um... Yeah, I'll just wait out here.

41:17.576 --> 41:20.545
Wow, that was impressive.
You... I like to drink fast too, so...

41:20.713 --> 41:22.681
Okay, wait, watch this.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.815
Nurse.

41:25.384 --> 41:28.512
Nurse, can I get another?

41:29.521 --> 41:32.183
- Wait, this is on you, right?
- Oh, yeah, I got it all.

41:32.358 --> 41:35.088
Nurse? Four shots of tequila, okay?

41:37.229 --> 41:39.823
I think it's really funny to call
a waitress "nurse."

41:41.834 --> 41:43.358
Nurse.

41:43.535 --> 41:47.835
So, Brandi. I'm just dying to know,
how much do you love working in this mall?

41:48.007 --> 41:50.840
- Oh, God, I hate that shit.
- Me too. I fucking hate it.

41:51.010 --> 41:53.478
I mean,
I just listen to bitching all day long.

41:53.646 --> 41:55.910
I, like, do makeup
on these fat-ass women.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.105
And you know what?

41:57.283 --> 42:00.844
My mom always said, "You can polish
a turd, but it's still a piece of shit."

42:01.020 --> 42:02.453
Exactly.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.521
Anyway, that's the fucking mall,
you know?

42:04.690 --> 42:08.751
That is such an incredible journey
that you must be going on every day.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.163
Hold up, all right?

42:13.332 --> 42:16.130
- What the fuck is that?
- It's nothing. What? It's nothing.

42:16.302 --> 42:17.826
Let me see. Don't be stingy.

42:19.138 --> 42:20.833
Come here.

42:21.173 --> 42:25.109
- It's a pill I'm supposed to take.
- Oh, my God, where did you get these?

42:25.277 --> 42:26.505
From my doctor.

42:26.679 --> 42:28.112
Clonazepam.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.748
That's the good shit. I am impressed.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.816
I did not think you partied like that.

42:32.985 --> 42:37.149
God, do I ever party like...
I party like this every four to six hours.

42:38.057 --> 42:39.354
Can I have one?

42:40.059 --> 42:42.027
- Really?
- Come on, please?

42:42.194 --> 42:44.628
Come on. Ronnie, come on.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.657
You know what?

42:47.733 --> 42:49.894
You can take the whole thing.
Take all of them.

42:50.069 --> 42:53.505
I don't think I need them anymore.
Everything is going great in my life.

42:53.672 --> 42:56.334
Just like it is with you,
and I have this cop thing.

42:56.508 --> 43:00.308
Those pills just kind of keep me here
but right now, you know...

43:00.479 --> 43:02.310
But I just... I just need to...

43:03.649 --> 43:05.708
You know, that's what I need right now.
I'm on this.

43:06.151 --> 43:10.485
And those stop me from doing that,
so consider those my gift to you, Brandi.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.317
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:12.491 --> 43:15.324
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah, anything. Anything.

43:15.494 --> 43:18.463
- I thought this dinner was gonna suck.
- Me too. Why?

43:18.630 --> 43:22.259
I was like, "Okay, weird guy at the mall
asking me out."

43:22.434 --> 43:23.992
Oh, my God.

43:24.169 --> 43:26.831
But now I got a whole new script.

43:27.006 --> 43:28.200
Thank you.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.941
- All right.
- Shots.

43:31.110 --> 43:34.568
Yeah, shots. Down the hatch.

43:34.747 --> 43:35.771
Put those here.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.678
To eternal life together.

43:39.852 --> 43:41.786
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

43:43.622 --> 43:45.283
Come on, bitch.

43:45.557 --> 43:48.355
Oh, my God. It burns so good.

43:49.895 --> 43:51.453
Oh, yeah.

43:54.266 --> 43:56.632
Yeah. Oh, yeah, again.

43:56.802 --> 43:58.793
You are so fucking gorgeous.

44:41.647 --> 44:43.171
Brandi...

44:43.515 --> 44:46.006
...this has just been a magical evening.

44:46.185 --> 44:47.914
It's been amazing...

44:48.087 --> 44:50.749
...and I think I gotta say congratulations.

44:50.923 --> 44:54.154
We made it to the next level, you know?
We did it together.

44:54.326 --> 44:57.762
- I couldn't be... Oh, God.
- I am so fucking shit-faced.

44:57.930 --> 44:59.659
You okay?

45:01.867 --> 45:04.097
I think I need a mint or something.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.897
My breath tastes like shit.

45:07.239 --> 45:09.207
Oh, Brandi.

45:11.143 --> 45:13.111
I accept you.

45:35.667 --> 45:37.567
Oh, Brandi.

45:37.736 --> 45:39.465
Oh, God, Brandi.

45:39.638 --> 45:41.367
Brandi.

45:42.875 --> 45:44.399
Brandi?

45:45.978 --> 45:48.572
Why are you stopping, motherfucker?

45:48.747 --> 45:50.009
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:50.182 --> 45:51.342
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

45:51.917 --> 45:54.977
Okay, Ronnie. Today I'll be
giving you a psychiatric evaluation...

45:55.154 --> 45:58.646
...to determine if you're competent
to enter into the police academy.

45:58.824 --> 46:01.452
So let's start with your background.
Where are you from?

46:01.627 --> 46:04.653
- Born and raised right here, actually.
- Oh, local boy, okay.

46:04.830 --> 46:07.663
And, Ronnie,
do you have any history of depression...

46:07.833 --> 46:09.994
...or psychosis or anything like that?

46:10.169 --> 46:12.399
Yeah,
but nothing really worth mentioning.

46:12.571 --> 46:14.300
Just a little bipolar disorder.

46:14.473 --> 46:15.804
Not a big deal.

46:15.974 --> 46:20.343
Oh. Well, are you taking
any prescription medications?

46:20.512 --> 46:24.073
I am pleased to announce that I am
currently off all prescription medication.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.614
Congratulations.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.718
Why did the doctors take you off?

46:27.886 --> 46:29.080
They didn't.

46:29.855 --> 46:31.413
How are you feeling?

46:31.590 --> 46:32.682
Great, actually.

46:32.858 --> 46:34.416
I met a girl. We're in love.

46:34.593 --> 46:36.356
So that is very good.

46:36.528 --> 46:40.828
I'm this close to catching this pervert,
catching a robber.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.933
Just generally becoming the man.

46:43.101 --> 46:47.629
So at this point in my life, I just really feel
like I could destroy some motherfuckers.

46:48.707 --> 46:50.470
Okay, I'm just gonna write that down.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.906
- Yeah, write it on down.
- Okay.

46:53.345 --> 46:56.280
Why do you wanna become
a police officer?

46:57.549 --> 47:00.040
That's the big question, now, isn't it?

47:01.920 --> 47:03.820
I have a dream...

47:03.989 --> 47:05.957
...most nights.

47:06.592 --> 47:08.025
It starts on a playground.

47:08.193 --> 47:12.095
And there's kids, you know, swinging,
and they're laughing.

47:12.264 --> 47:15.893
There are dogs barking,
butterflies just flapping their little wings.

47:16.969 --> 47:19.597
And then you hear a rumbling...

47:19.938 --> 47:23.669
...and over the horizon
comes a black cloud...

47:23.842 --> 47:25.742
...and it's made of cancer...

47:25.911 --> 47:27.105
...and pus.

47:27.279 --> 47:29.110
It starts sweeping over the playground.

47:29.281 --> 47:31.806
And everyone starts screaming
and clawing their eyes...

47:31.984 --> 47:35.078
...and pulling at their hair,
and saying, "Help! What do we do?"

47:35.254 --> 47:37.552
And you know what happens next?

47:38.190 --> 47:39.589
Out steps me...

47:39.758 --> 47:42.989
...wielding the biggest fucking shotgun
you've ever seen in your life.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.822
And you know what I do?

47:44.997 --> 47:47.659
I blow every fucking thing away.

47:47.833 --> 47:51.269
And I am getting God's work done.

47:51.436 --> 47:56.271
When it's all over and the dust has settled,
the whole world gathers below me...

47:56.441 --> 47:59.342
...and they say, "Thank you, Ronnie,
thank you for helping...

47:59.511 --> 48:02.275
...being a great man
and doing this for us."

48:02.447 --> 48:04.210
And you know what I say?

48:04.383 --> 48:07.910
"You don't need to thank me.
I'm just a guy with a gun.

48:08.086 --> 48:09.383
I'm just a cop."

48:09.554 --> 48:11.522
Okay.

48:11.690 --> 48:15.387
That should do it.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Barnhardt.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.120
Eh. I think you mean Officer Barnhardt.

48:26.405 --> 48:27.599
- To Ronnie.
- Thanks.

48:28.974 --> 48:30.805
- Ronnie.
- Yeah.

48:30.976 --> 48:33.843
Ronnie Barnhardt got called up
to the big leagues.

48:34.012 --> 48:36.378
Finally gonna get to carry a gun
and everything.

48:36.548 --> 48:39.073
- That's awesome, Ronnie.
- Ronnie, I'm so proud of you.

48:39.251 --> 48:40.843
Thanks, Mom. Thanks for this cake.

48:41.019 --> 48:43.487
- Incredible.
- It's a gun.

48:43.655 --> 48:44.713
Oh, yeah.

48:44.890 --> 48:46.619
You're my little baby.

48:47.959 --> 48:49.688
I'm so happy for you.

48:49.861 --> 48:52.421
I think the White House
could be the next stop.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.122
I mean,
I think it could be that big, Ronnie.

48:55.300 --> 48:58.497
- I think so too.
- Oh, God, I'm so happy for...

48:58.670 --> 49:00.160
For your tears.

49:01.073 --> 49:03.337
Well, thank you, brown eyes.

49:03.875 --> 49:08.403
You know,
when Ronnie was in high school...

49:08.680 --> 49:10.272
...I used to fuck all his friends.

49:10.716 --> 49:14.243
Okay, Mom, don't hit on Dennis.
Is that okay?

49:14.419 --> 49:17.513
- A piece of icing right there, see?
- That's some icing right there.

49:17.689 --> 49:20.715
Yeah, I think you spilt more on it,
probably.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.860
And it'll tingle just a little bit...

49:24.029 --> 49:26.224
...but you get used to it.

49:39.544 --> 49:41.205
Feel that?

49:46.485 --> 49:49.045
Wait for me.

49:53.625 --> 49:55.490
Ronnie, wait.

50:47.145 --> 50:49.272
Don't say anything, it's gonna give it away.

50:49.448 --> 50:51.882
- I'm not going to. This is gonna be funny.
- I know.

50:52.551 --> 50:54.314
- Watch... Jeez.
- Ow!

50:54.486 --> 50:55.646
I'm sorry.

50:56.421 --> 50:57.547
- All right.
- Well...

50:57.722 --> 50:59.519
Okay, I'll call.

51:01.460 --> 51:03.121
Yeah, come in.

51:03.762 --> 51:06.162
- What's up, brother?
- Hey, Ronnie.

51:06.331 --> 51:07.559
How's it going, amigo?

51:07.732 --> 51:09.461
Oh, have a seat.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.269
- How you doing?
- I'm great.

51:14.439 --> 51:17.499
- This is nice. Yeah.
- I don't usually do this kind of thing...

51:18.376 --> 51:19.707
...but...

51:20.479 --> 51:22.743
...I wanted to be the one
to give you the news...

51:22.914 --> 51:24.973
...and see your face when you found out.

51:25.517 --> 51:28.008
Very good, sir. I appreciate that.
Thank you, sir.

51:30.055 --> 51:33.354
We're not gonna be able
to let you join the academy.

51:34.259 --> 51:37.490
That's not possible, so...
Yeah, that's not true.

51:37.963 --> 51:40.830
It seems you had trouble
passing the minimum requirements.

51:41.433 --> 51:43.924
- Did I fail one of the tests?
- Actually, you did.

51:44.102 --> 51:46.070
You failed the psychological exam.

51:46.938 --> 51:49.566
I remember she put a big A-plus on it
and a "pass."

51:49.741 --> 51:51.174
- Yeah.
- And that was me, so...

51:51.343 --> 51:53.903
- I passed that. I passed the shit out of it.
- Really?

51:54.079 --> 51:56.138
It says right here.

51:56.314 --> 51:59.545
"Mr. Barnhardt
shows warning signs of delusion.

52:01.086 --> 52:05.318
Allowing him to join the force at this time
puts his life...

52:05.490 --> 52:07.617
...and the lives of others in jeopardy."

52:07.792 --> 52:09.987
I don't... Um...

52:10.161 --> 52:11.924
I don't see how this is possible.

52:12.597 --> 52:14.588
- You got problems.
- No...

52:14.766 --> 52:18.099
We can take care... We can handle this.
We can... We can figure this out.

52:18.270 --> 52:20.864
I know this is hard to hear.

52:25.176 --> 52:27.974
So I thought
this was gonna be kind of funny...

52:28.146 --> 52:33.413
...but it's actually kind of sad,
so I'll catch you later, Harrison.

52:36.921 --> 52:39.082
So I tried talking to them.

52:39.257 --> 52:42.715
There's just no way
they're gonna let you in.

52:44.429 --> 52:48.456
Your dreams of becoming a police officer
just aren't gonna happen.

53:29.507 --> 53:30.906
Hi, I'm Nell.

53:31.075 --> 53:33.407
Wait. Do you want some of my buns?

53:33.578 --> 53:34.738
Yeah. Here, toast it.

53:34.912 --> 53:36.106
Oh, my brake broke.

53:36.281 --> 53:38.044
Bam, right into the...
Into the frigging fryer.

53:39.651 --> 53:41.812
- She'd go headfirst in the fryer...
- Hey.

53:41.986 --> 53:44.648
I thought you were gonna go work
for the police.

53:44.822 --> 53:45.982
You know, I made it...

53:46.157 --> 53:50.059
...and I tried it out for a few days
and I just decided it wasn't for me...

53:50.228 --> 53:52.992
...so I decided to come back here.

53:53.164 --> 53:56.463
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- No problem, Ronnie.

53:56.634 --> 53:58.568
- Hey, you want a cup of coffee?
- No.

53:59.637 --> 54:01.730
No, I don't think I do.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.806
No offense to you...

54:03.975 --> 54:05.806
...but I'm gonna have...

54:06.244 --> 54:07.643
...to refuse your coffee.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.576
You know,
coffee seems disgusting to me.

54:10.748 --> 54:13.683
In fact, right now,
I don't think I want anything less...

54:13.851 --> 54:16.081
...in the whole world
than a cup of your coffee.

54:16.254 --> 54:17.687
So no, thank you.

54:29.367 --> 54:31.301
Okay, you know,
on second thought, maybe.

54:31.469 --> 54:34.700
- Yeah, sure, I'll have a cup of coffee.
- Roger's so mean to me.

54:35.573 --> 54:37.268
- Who's Roger?
- The manager.

54:37.442 --> 54:39.603
He hates me because I can't walk.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.870
He talks about me with that girl
all the time.

54:42.046 --> 54:45.072
They talk about how lazy I am.
Well, you know what? I'm not lazy.

54:45.249 --> 54:48.548
The only reason I'm sitting in this chair
is because of my leg.

54:48.720 --> 54:51.848
I wanna quit and I can't
because I don't have any money...

54:52.023 --> 54:55.220
...for the doctor bills
and insurance and stuff.

54:56.094 --> 54:57.686
I'm sorry.

55:09.974 --> 55:12.340
Oh, hey, you can't come back here.

55:12.677 --> 55:13.974
- Get in there!
- No, no!

55:14.145 --> 55:15.169
You get in there!

55:15.346 --> 55:16.506
Get in there!

55:16.681 --> 55:18.546
- You like making fun of people?
- I don't.

55:18.716 --> 55:20.547
- I don't. No, no.
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

55:20.718 --> 55:22.447
- You like making fun of people?
- No!

55:22.620 --> 55:25.919
You say one more thing to Nell,
I'm gonna fucking murder you!

55:26.090 --> 55:28.354
- I won't.
- You too!

55:35.767 --> 55:37.166
I was never here, okay?

55:37.335 --> 55:38.700
Okay.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.008
Ronnie, I just wanna let you know
it's really good to have you back.

55:52.183 --> 55:53.377
Hey.

55:53.885 --> 55:56.649
What the hell are you doing, huh?

55:57.188 --> 55:58.849
You're putting a boot on my car?

55:59.023 --> 56:02.823
- Would you please just try and calm down?
- Louder. More authoritative.

56:02.994 --> 56:04.484
Calm the fuck down!

56:04.662 --> 56:06.823
Hey, fuck you, okay?
I'm a business owner.

56:06.998 --> 56:09.933
You don't take this boot off,
I'm gonna start whupping some ass.

56:10.101 --> 56:12.433
- Take out your Taser.
- You have no right.

56:12.603 --> 56:16.369
- Take out your fucking Taser, Charles.
- Ronnie, I'm not gonna Taser...

56:16.541 --> 56:17.565
What?

56:17.742 --> 56:19.642
- Fuck.
- How hard is that?

56:19.811 --> 56:21.676
It's the easiest thing on earth.

56:21.846 --> 56:24.440
I got another one right here,
motherfucker.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.616
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Ronnie, how's it going?

56:29.854 --> 56:32.448
Think we found something
that might cheer you up.

56:32.623 --> 56:35.490
A clue in the pervert case.
We found it next to the Dumpsters.

56:38.296 --> 56:41.857
You okay, Ronnie?
I expected a little bit more of a reaction.

56:42.033 --> 56:43.398
I'm not okay, Charles.

56:43.568 --> 56:45.229
And...

56:45.403 --> 56:49.567
...unfortunately, no, this picture of a penis
does not cheer me up.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.867
Okay, you guys, we should...

56:52.043 --> 56:53.977
We should probably go get to work.

56:54.145 --> 56:55.373
Something.

56:55.546 --> 56:57.241
All right, well, just take it easy.

57:00.451 --> 57:02.476
I don't know what's happening to me,
Dennis.

57:02.653 --> 57:04.746
I feel like I'm losing it.

57:05.156 --> 57:06.987
A change is coming.

57:07.358 --> 57:08.586
I used to think...

57:08.759 --> 57:11.023
...I was the only thing...

57:11.195 --> 57:12.822
...between the light...

57:12.997 --> 57:14.760
...and the darkness.
- Mm-hm.

57:14.932 --> 57:16.593
But you know what I realize now?

57:16.767 --> 57:18.701
This is who I am.

57:20.171 --> 57:21.661
Hm.

57:22.273 --> 57:24.798
Take me in, Dennis. Don't look away.

57:24.976 --> 57:28.537
Ronnie, can you please
take the dick off your face?

57:30.214 --> 57:32.045
I'm real glad that you opened up to me.

57:32.817 --> 57:36.048
Because it makes me, like, open up
my heart, you know what I'm saying?

57:36.220 --> 57:39.917
Like, share the stuff that's been happening
to me because I used to be like you.

57:40.091 --> 57:43.458
I fell into that world of pretend.

57:43.628 --> 57:45.960
And that's where you gotta smarten up...

57:46.264 --> 57:47.731
...and cut somebody sometime.

57:48.799 --> 57:50.790
You might think that I float, you know.

57:50.968 --> 57:53.368
Maybe even walk on water and stuff.

57:53.538 --> 57:54.766
But...

57:54.939 --> 57:57.339
...I'm here to tell you that, sometimes...

57:57.508 --> 57:59.271
...I drink out of a volcano.

57:59.443 --> 58:03.345
I know how to deal with the system.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.038
I know how to fuck with it.

58:06.117 --> 58:08.585
I just gotta ask you, Ronnie...

58:08.753 --> 58:10.653
...are you willing to accept...

58:10.821 --> 58:12.812
...what I have to teach?

58:13.491 --> 58:14.651
I'm ready.

58:14.825 --> 58:17.589
- Do you want me to show you the way?
- Show me the path.

58:17.762 --> 58:20.253
- Can I lead you, please?
- Lead me.

58:20.431 --> 58:23.264
- I'm gonna put you in my pocket.
- Guide me.

58:23.434 --> 58:25.095
You're in my hands.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.165
When do we start?

58:27.905 --> 58:29.395
Right now.

59:32.003 --> 59:33.664
No, no, no.

59:52.990 --> 59:55.982
I'm not gonna lie to you.
There's nothing good about this at all.

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:04.525
- You okay, Dennis?
- Look, look here.

01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:05.760
Let's get back to work.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.784
- Dennis.
- Yes, Ronnie?

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.446
I gotta... I have to thank you, man,
you know, like...

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:31.186
- Yeah.
- I felt like shit this morning, and now...

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:34.659
You've shown me I don't need
to take things so seriously.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:37.767
- Don't take it serious.
- We got a fucking meaningless existence.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:41.302
- That is... Sometimes it don't mean shit.
- Who cares though, right?

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:44.100
- Who cares? That's what I'm saying.
- Who cares? Oh, man.

01:00:44.275 --> 01:00:45.299
It doesn't matter.

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:51.676
And, you know what? I'm just glad that
I finally have a partner in crime, man.

01:00:52.283 --> 01:00:53.807
Oh, wow, man.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:57.052
You dropped the P-bomb on me, man.

01:00:58.189 --> 01:01:00.157
It feels so good to hear you
say that, man.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.519
I've never had a partner.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:05.390
I love you.

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:09.232
- I love you too, man.
- I love you.

01:01:09.567 --> 01:01:10.829
Yeah.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.828
I don't care. I don't care.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:17.132
- You can't catch me. You can't catch me.
- I'm gonna catch you.

01:01:17.308 --> 01:01:21.301
But you ain't seen the best part yet, man,
because when everybody leave this place...

01:01:21.479 --> 01:01:23.470
...I rob the shit out that motherfucker.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:25.114
What are you talking about?

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:27.842
What do you mean?
Man, I steal shit.

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.250
You're the one robbing the mall?

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.448
Yeah.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.217
I got the code...

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.860
...from the security camera.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.826
- Right in front of my face?
- In front of your fucking face.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.660
You guys didn't even realize it.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:46.769
Ronnie, this is beautiful.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.233
Dennis, I can't be a part of this.

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:53.103
- I thought you said you were my partner.
- I know, but l...

01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.408
But I can't do that.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.676
What has this place ever done for you?
Don't you see that people see us as jokes?

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.876
Doesn't that hurt your feelings?

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.211
Yeah.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.916
- Yeah, it really does, but I can't.
- All right, well, suit yourself, Ronnie.

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:11.323
You know, you could be a slave.

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:13.122
I already told you...

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:14.730
...I'm a motherfucking outlaw.

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:16.158
Please stop, Dennis.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.995
We're best friends, man.
Let's just stop this.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.967
We'll go get a beer, you know?

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:25.541
Let's pretend this never happened.
I won't say a word about this. Let's just go.

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.404
Ronnie, you right.

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:30.206
Ronnie, you as right as hell.
What was I thinking?

01:02:30.381 --> 01:02:33.407
Like robbing the mall,
taking jewelry and stuff?

01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:35.142
I'm... What's all that about?

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.014
- I don't know, man.
- You right, man.

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.587
- Let's go get a beer.
- Yes.

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:40.246
Yeah.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:41.985
Thank you, man.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.889
And honestly? I will never say a word
about this to anyone.

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:47.087
- I appreciate it.
- People make mistakes. No.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.825
- You're a real good friend, saying that.
- We're friends, so that's just how...

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:55.666
Oh, fuck, Dennis.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.105
- How could you, man?
- Oh.

01:03:28.439 --> 01:03:30.168
How could you not know it was Dennis?

01:03:30.341 --> 01:03:35.074
Then how could you be so stupid as to let
him get away in the raffle car of all things?

01:03:36.614 --> 01:03:37.706
Well, may I speak now?

01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:38.940
Go ahead.

01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:42.113
I found this.

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:43.913
That's the pervert's penis.

01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:47.888
He's still in this mall. He's laying low,
waiting for a new opportunity to pounce.

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:50.083
Well, I'll turn this over to the police.

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:53.230
You'll not give that to the police.
I don't think you understand.

01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:55.164
Look...

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.331
...I let Dennis get away.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:03.096
That's something I'll have to live with.
But finding out whose penis that is...

01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:04.969
...is my last shot at redemption.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:08.168
- Let's just hope he doesn't show up again.
- Oh, he's coming back.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.609
He's coming back quick
and he's coming back hard.

01:04:11.382 --> 01:04:13.942
- What are you talking about, Ronnie?
- Deep cover, Mark.

01:04:14.118 --> 01:04:17.952
I'm talking about black ops shit. I'm talking
about going off the grid completely.

01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:21.154
<i>I'm gonna be a specter, an invisible man.</i>

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:25.152
I'm just a regular guy in the mall.
I got no rules to follow.

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:26.990
<i>Just got myself and my instinct.</i>

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.129
Are you fucking retarded, Ronnie?

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:33.533
Ronnie doesn't even exist.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.501
My name is Gil Jacobson.

01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:38.468
<i>I'm just your average mall customer.</i>

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:41.338
<i>I came to the Forest Ridge Mall...</i>

01:04:41.512 --> 01:04:43.571
<i>... to do some personal shopping.</i>

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:46.181
<i>Hey, you know where any sales are?</i>

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:50.553
<i>This is my mall.</i>

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.882
<i>It's a place of beauty...</i>

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:54.388
<i>... a place of purity.</i>

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:57.322
<i>It's a place where lost souls
can find a home.</i>

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.252
Fuck you, Ronnie.

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:01.455
Nice hat, you stupid motherfucker.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:05.865
<i>I believe every man
has a path laid out before him...</i>

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:09.028
<i>... and my path is a righteous one.</i>

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.671
<i>For I have been chosen
to be the protector...</i>

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:16.446
<i>... and the destroyer.</i>

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.779
<i>I live by a code.</i>

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:27.583
<i>A code of my own invention,
but a code nonetheless.</i>

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:31.554
<i>And I follow it to the fucking T.</i>

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:36.097
<i>Danger lurks in the darkness
waiting to pounce...</i>

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:41.363
<i>... and it's my duty to face that danger
and stare it in its godless eyes.</i>

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:43.165
- Mandy.
- Fuck.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.398
Mandy.

01:05:44.575 --> 01:05:45.940
Shit on me.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:47.634
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.745
- Tell me again. Tell me again.
- Yeah.

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:51.107
Fuck, yeah.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.476
<i>Nothing can hurt me.</i>

01:05:53.851 --> 01:05:56.445
<i>My body has become a weapon.</i>

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.884
<i>I am an instrument of protection...</i>

01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:01.248
<i>... and justice.</i>

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:06.362
<i>I am the hammer in the right hand
of all that is good.</i>

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:07.929
How could you do this to me?

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:11.067
I love you, you fucking bitch!

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.539
You just made me blow my cover.

01:06:25.616 --> 01:06:27.345
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Hey.

01:06:27.518 --> 01:06:28.678
Um, Mark's looking for you.

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.548
He's really pissed about the altercation
in Cosmetics.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:33.690
He's talking about calling the cops...

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:37.224
...so you should probably
just get going, man. This is gonna get...

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:39.123
This is gonna get really weird.

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:40.786
Ronnie Barnhardt's not here.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:43.398
But if he was here...

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:47.560
...he'd say that if Mark wants him
to leave this fucking mall...

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:52.505
...it will be over
Ronnie's dead fucking body.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.309
<i>In these dark times,
people need something to believe in.</i>

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:03.942
<i>I believe that good will win through
in the end.</i>

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:09.189
<i>It's only a matter of time until the clouds
part and the sun shines...</i>

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.656
<i>I'm gonna start that again.</i>

01:07:11.295 --> 01:07:17.530
<i>It's only a matter of time until
the clouds part and the sun shines down.</i>

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:21.364
<i>They'll be here soon
and my mission will be complete.</i>

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.138
<i>I will leave a mark so big
that it will be felt for years to come...</i>

01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:29.939
<i>... and history will remember my name.</i>

01:07:30.114 --> 01:07:31.581
<i>There's no turning back.</i>

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:34.114
<i>I must stand fast in my resolve.</i>

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:37.481
<i>The world has no use
for another scared man.</i>

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:41.784
<i>Right now,
the world needs a fucking hero.</i>

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:53.559
Ronnie!

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.501
Ronnie.

01:08:00.244 --> 01:08:03.577
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.017
Harrison.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:09.880
Ronnie, what are you doing?

01:08:10.053 --> 01:08:13.819
I thought we were allies, Harrison.
I thought we were brothers of the badge.

01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:15.856
How the fuck do you sleep at night?

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:17.755
Come on, let's do this the easy way.

01:08:17.928 --> 01:08:20.488
You come outside
and we'll talk all about it, all right?

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.491
- Can't do that.
- Let's go.

01:08:22.666 --> 01:08:24.759
We'll talk about it, but you gotta get out.

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:28.063
You can go outside. This is my world.

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:30.403
We don't wanna hurt you, Ronnie.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.939
You wanna get hurt?

01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:42.613
You didn't bring enough pigs to hurt me.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:50.756
You sure about that?

01:08:56.667 --> 01:08:58.725
Why don't we find out, huh?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.395
All right. Go get him.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.925
Open up, little birdie.

01:11:52.843 --> 01:11:55.277
What's on the agenda for today?

01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.906
I don't know.
Maybe look for a job or something.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.880
I know it's hard...

01:12:03.253 --> 01:12:05.585
...but try to look on the bright side.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:10.088
You may not be the smartest person
in the world...

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.625
...but you're...

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:16.959
...handsome from certain angles...

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:20.432
...and you're... More importantly...

01:12:20.604 --> 01:12:22.595
...you've got dreams inside of you...

01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:25.333
...and dreams make you special.

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:28.940
And no matter what the world, um...

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:32.104
...throws at you, uh, they...

01:12:32.282 --> 01:12:35.115
It can never take your dreams away.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:40.088
What are you talking about, Mom?

01:12:40.257 --> 01:12:42.987
I don't know, I'm drunk.

01:12:43.994 --> 01:12:47.054
I just know mothers
are supposed to say stuff like that...

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.425
...to their children when they're sad.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.625
- And so I tried.
- No, you're right.

01:12:51.802 --> 01:12:54.965
You're right, that's exactly
what you're supposed to say.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.303
You know, Ronnie...

01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:02.273
...the other night
when I soiled my pants...

01:13:02.446 --> 01:13:05.711
...you know,
I was expecting for you to come home...

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.010
...and find me and clean me up.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:14.349
And I thought
you'd be there to take care of me, so l...

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:19.586
You know, I passed out on the floor
and I didn't worry.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:25.730
And most people
would've thrown me away by now...

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:28.029
...but not you, Ronnie.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.638
I do it because I love you, Mom.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.035
I know.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.439
I just want you to know...

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.876
...I'm ready to make a change.

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:40.978
You're gonna stop drinking?

01:13:42.352 --> 01:13:45.014
I'm switching to beer.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:49.756
I can pound those all day
and still keep my shit together.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.087
And I'm doing it for you.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:53.661
I'm so proud of you, Mom.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.525
I'm so proud of you.

01:13:55.699 --> 01:13:56.927
And you know what?

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.328
This is a new day.

01:13:58.502 --> 01:13:59.901
We're gonna get through it.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:08.006
Oh, I just remembered.

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:11.375
This postcard
came for you the other day.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:22.689
<i>What's up, motherfackle?</i>

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.417
<i>How's your dick hanging?</i>

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:25.959
<i>Low, I hope.</i>

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.927
<i>I just wanted to write you and say
that I really am sorry...</i>

01:14:29.099 --> 01:14:31.158
<i>... for the way shit
like went down and stuff.</i>

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:32.665
<i>My bad, my blunder.</i>

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:36.328
<i>I just want you to know
that you really are my best friend.</i>

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:39.873
<i>The problem is, I'm a criminal, man,
who doesn't care.</i>

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:43.103
<i>And your crime is you care too much.</i>

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.009
<i>Regardless of our differences...</i>

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.911
<i>... I hope you know
that I always respected you.</i>

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:52.180
<i>It's not every day that you meet somebody
that stands for something in this world.</i>

01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:55.153
<i>Anyway, no hard feelings, okay?</i>

01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:58.488
<i>If you ever wanna party,
just get your ass to Mexico.</i>

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:01.153
<i>The beer is cool and the girls are wet.</i>

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:03.629
<i>Sincerely, your right-hand man...</i>

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.064
<i>... love, Dennis Chavante.</i>

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.342
Hey there, stranger.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.649
- You got your cast off.
- Yeah.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:25.111
Got my hair done too.

01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:30.788
Hey, um...

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:32.724
...I heard what happened.

01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:35.297
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:35.465 --> 01:15:36.932
That was...

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.001
Just, I'm like... You know, I'm like a cat.

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:41.831
I always land on my feet.

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:43.700
I'm A-okay.

01:15:44.608 --> 01:15:46.371
I got you a coffee.

01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:52.714
Thank... Well, how much
do I owe you, then?

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.350
- Is it $ 1.60...?
- You don't have to pay for it.

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:57.383
You can just take it.

01:15:58.088 --> 01:16:01.546
That's really nice of you.
I appreciate it, but...

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:07.229
Look, the whole reason
I came here today...

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.626
...was to come buy a cup of coffee...

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:11.460
...and pay for it...

01:16:11.635 --> 01:16:15.469
...out of my own pocket,
and I've just been kind of waiting out here.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.970
I need to accept...

01:16:22.846 --> 01:16:24.507
...that there's no more free coffee.

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:26.148
Not now...

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:27.845
...not ever. I just...

01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:30.714
You know, when I come to this mall...

01:16:33.356 --> 01:16:36.120
...I pay for my coffee...

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:40.327
...just like a regular customer.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:08.718
- Oh, motherfucker.
- Ah!

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.378
Everybody, get out of the way!
Move! Move!

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.279
Oh, no, no, no!

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:20.649
Jesus, Ronnie!

01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:22.985
You fucking killed him.

01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:25.521
Oh.

01:19:25.695 --> 01:19:27.356
- All right, he's okay.
- Shit. Really?

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.556
Get out of the way!
Mall security, get out of the way!

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:32.767
Stay down, motherfucker.

01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:34.403
- We've got your back.
- All right.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:36.935
- We need to call an ambulance.
- No.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:38.505
This sack of shit is mine.

01:19:38.675 --> 01:19:41.109
Hold my piece.
I'm taking him to the station myself.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.302
Get up, motherfucker.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.174
Hey, Ronnie.

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:54.518
Come on.

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.153
Ronnie?

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:01.456
Good job.

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.121
Fuck you.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:06.063
And if anyone here wants a girl
to have sex with you...

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:09.694
...and then to fuck your enemy,
go to Brandi!

01:20:09.873 --> 01:20:11.807
Because she's the girl that does that!

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:15.306
God.

01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:26.848
Good job, Ronnie.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.586
Come here.

01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:48.638
Caught the pervert.

01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:51.837
- Someone get a paramedic. Hurry up.
Hurry.

01:20:52.015 --> 01:20:56.315
I want everyone to know
Ronnie Barnhardt caught the pervert...

01:20:56.486 --> 01:20:59.182
...not the fucking police.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:00.947
Good job, you caught a pervert.

01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:03.752
You can take your fucking badge
and your gun...

01:21:03.927 --> 01:21:05.792
...and you can shove them
up your butt...

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:09.056
...because I don't need that shit to know
who the fuck I am.

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:10.722
Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.697
Fuck every one of you.

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:15.598
I win.

01:21:22.879 --> 01:21:24.779
Way to go, Ronnie.

01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:46.067
I'm here with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of
mall security here at the Forest Ridge Mall.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:49.830
Ronnie is the man who brought
the Forest Ridge Mall flasher to justice.

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:53.134
We caught the flasher. Yes!

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:54.833
All is back to normal?

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:58.503
I'd say better than normal, actually.
Personal life is going fantastic.

01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:00.672
I met a girl, right over there.

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:04.183
She has made a promise to God
that she won't have sex before marriage...

01:22:04.354 --> 01:22:07.323
...but that's a promise
I intend on making her break.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.424
Gather around me, guys.
