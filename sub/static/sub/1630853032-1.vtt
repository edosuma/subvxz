05:31.180 --> 05:33.180
I've already had
the authorization.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.210
I'll be there in two days.

05:35.310 --> 05:37.580
If I don't do anything now,
she dies.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.680

05:38.780 --> 05:40.320

05:53.570 --> 05:55.030

05:55.130 --> 05:59.400
Because if the devil
finds a single crack in you,

he will reach
the depth of your soul.

Ah!

08:41.730 --> 08:43.570
[heavy breathing]

08:45.170 --> 08:47.310
I will use in your mysteries

08:47.410 --> 08:49.510

08:49.610 --> 08:52.040
cast out demons

to bring forth
and pass forth dangers.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.470
[laughing]

09:19.570 --> 09:21.240
You gave commands
to your apostles

09:21.340 --> 09:23.110
with wondrous moments
to do great things,

09:23.210 --> 09:26.810

The rumors are true,

15:12.070 --> 15:13.530
you are a saint.

All my children.

Did you call
the capitol again?

16:10.180 --> 16:11.920
I told you,
they never answered me.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.620
There is no food,
no medicine.

No one who can lessen
this virus.

[Peter, in Spanish] His resurrection
manifests forgiveness,

16:36.660 --> 16:40.040
and above all,
the renewal of our faith.

We ask for the healing
of our children,

16:46.590 --> 16:49.630
we beg Thee with all our faith
and free of all sin.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.050

- Lord, hear our prayer.

17:19.220 --> 17:20.920

I'm sorry.

[sighs]

17:29.230 --> 17:32.230
We've lost four kids
this week.

17:37.740 --> 17:40.770
Feels like a punishment
from the Lord.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.090
[children shouting happily]

17:55.650 --> 17:57.090
You were possessed.

17:57.190 --> 17:58.520
It wasn't you.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.290
I let it happen.

18:02.230 --> 18:03.760
I was weak.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.930
I haven't been
forgiven, Nelson.

18:07.030 --> 18:10.030
God hasn't forgiven me
and I haven't forgiven myself.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.670
<i>I tried to confess,</i>

18:12.770 --> 18:14.870
<i>but Father Tomás
gave me a penance</i>

18:14.970 --> 18:19.010
<i>that I've never been able
to go through with.</i>

18:19.110 --> 18:21.950
<i>He told me to confess
the facts to the bishop.</i>

18:22.050 --> 18:23.720
It's not the
best decision, Peter.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.490
I haven't found peace.

18:32.490 --> 18:34.190
These mountains,
Nelson.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.860
The church.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.230
The children.

18:42.270 --> 18:43.800
The orphanage.

18:45.670 --> 18:48.410
This is where
I found my true home.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.980
And you'll lose it.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.550
You'll be ex-communicated,

18:53.650 --> 18:57.380
and you won't be able
to help our people anymore.

18:59.290 --> 19:02.890
There's nothing I can do
to help them now.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.570
[roars]

19:35.190 --> 19:36.950
[Balducci]
Welcome, Father Peter.

19:37.060 --> 19:39.990
It's not every day
you get a visit from a saint.

19:40.090 --> 19:43.530
Monsignor Balducci,
I am not a saint.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.800
A long time ago

19:45.900 --> 19:48.170
I committed a sin, and...

19:50.540 --> 19:53.640
I've never had the courage
to confess it to you.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.340
Come on, Peter.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.810
Please.

19:56.910 --> 20:01.280
You have been helping
our people for 18 years.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.420
People here love you.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.950
And even in the Vatican,

20:05.050 --> 20:07.520
there is talk about
the miracle you performed

20:07.620 --> 20:09.920
18 years ago.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.460
Are you serious, Monsignor?

20:11.560 --> 20:13.120
But of course.

20:13.230 --> 20:16.630
The Vatican has not
been blind to your work.

20:17.930 --> 20:20.200
Maybe you are not
a saint for that, Peter,

20:20.300 --> 20:23.740
but only someone
who carries God inside

20:23.840 --> 20:25.900
could do something
like this.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.740
And I also know
everything you've done

20:28.840 --> 20:32.010
to ask for humanitarian aid.

20:32.880 --> 20:37.120
But your prayers
have been heard.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.330
This is a lot of money.

20:51.430 --> 20:54.500
This Easter will bring
a miracle.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.600
You are destined
to do great things, Peter.

20:59.370 --> 21:00.270
And from Rome,

21:00.370 --> 21:03.070
you will be able
to help children

21:03.180 --> 21:05.540
all over the world.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.110
- [man, speaks in Spanish] The medicine is here, family!
- And the medical equipment!

21:48.450 --> 21:50.820
[Peter]
<i>I confess to Almighty God.</i>

21:50.920 --> 21:54.030
And to you,
my brothers and sisters.

21:55.090 --> 21:57.200
I have greatly sinned

21:57.300 --> 21:59.870
in my thoughts
and in my words,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.900
in what I have done,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.240
in what I have failed to do.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.710
Through my fault.
Through my fault.

22:07.810 --> 22:11.240
Through my fault.
Through my most grievous fault!

You okay?

Blood of Christ,
protect me.

Blood of Christ.
Blood of Christ.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.770
- Blood of Christ.

- [speaks Spanish] Hello?
- [Uribe speaks Spanish] Father Peter...

25:52.340 --> 25:53.260
- Who's calling?
- It's Uribe.

25:55.430 --> 25:56.550
I'm the warden
at the Sagrado Corazón prison.

25:57.510 --> 25:58.510
How can I help you?

26:00.390 --> 26:02.060
- We have a case with an inmate...
- Is she sick?

26:03.230 --> 26:04.310
I wouldn't call it that.

26:08.270 --> 26:09.310
You want me to send
my doctor over?

26:10.400 --> 26:11.820
She doesn't need a doctor.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.570
She needs a priest.

26:16.610 --> 26:18.620
<i>She asked for you personally,
she's running out of time.</i>

26:21.990 --> 26:22.910
Good morning, father.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.590
Morning.

26:34.570 --> 26:36.480
[cell door closes and latches]

26:36.580 --> 26:38.510
[radio beeps, static crackles]

Symptoms of epilepsy,

26:42.250 --> 26:44.020

26:44.120 --> 26:46.650
She hasn't eaten
in over two weeks.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.750
I don't know how
she's still alive.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.660
[door buzzes open]

26:50.810 --> 26:53.030
- What are the charges against...?
- Esperanza killed a man.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.990
They found him bled to death,
hanging from a tree,

26:58.280 --> 26:59.200
his head completely backwards.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.410
I don't feel comfortable
with this,

27:03.290 --> 27:04.540
trust me, we tried everything
before calling you.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.330
Shall we?

27:16.510 --> 27:18.720
Keep your distance, she's
extremely strong and aggressive.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.360
[door creaks open]

27:30.960 --> 27:32.800
[door closes]

27:34.200 --> 27:36.600
[whispering]

27:41.240 --> 27:42.660
You can speak from here.

27:43.710 --> 27:45.540
[inaudible]

27:47.200 --> 27:48.370
Hello, Esperanza.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.790
[in demonic voice]
The Easter will bring a miracle.

28:03.630 --> 28:05.730
How?

28:05.830 --> 28:07.670
Resurrection.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.600
We're five.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.570
Who?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.470
The children.

28:16.580 --> 28:19.610
What's the matter
with the children?

28:26.220 --> 28:30.390
[in normal voice] It feels like
a punishment from the Lord.

28:32.860 --> 28:35.430
Who are you?

28:35.530 --> 28:38.730
We already know each other,
Father.

28:40.070 --> 28:41.400
Oh, yeah.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.840
Very well.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.810
[guard speaks Spanish]
Stay back!

28:51.690 --> 28:52.797
I said stay back!

[wheezing]

28:54.510 --> 28:56.080
[gasps softly]

29:00.350 --> 29:02.890
I'm wet for you again.

29:55.470 --> 29:57.510
[voices stop]

30:10.260 --> 30:12.270
[speaks Spanish] A long time ago
I performed my first exorcism.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.190
I swore it would be the last.

30:18.730 --> 30:20.320
Do it for the girl's mother.

30:21.940 --> 30:23.240
She's desperate, poor thing.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.210
Do it for me.

30:38.050 --> 30:40.220
Do it for your daughter.

30:49.660 --> 30:51.930
She asked for you
to come.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.530
And she didn't even
know you existed.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.510
I heard you spent the last
several years saving lives.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.820
I couldn't live in this town
with those memories.

31:15.190 --> 31:19.360
A few weeks later,
I realized what you did to me.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.860
But who was going
to believe me?

31:21.960 --> 31:24.560
Who would see
the downside?

31:24.660 --> 31:27.400
It wasn't me, Magali.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.970
I swear to God,
I was possessed.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.900
Look at her.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.040
This is her true face.

31:37.810 --> 31:39.450
The demon has never left.

31:39.540 --> 31:42.250
He's been possessing
my girl over and over.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.820
Save her.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.620
If you really want
to redeem yourself,

31:46.720 --> 31:49.120
expel that demon
out of her body.

31:52.390 --> 31:53.930
[gasps]

32:13.850 --> 32:17.580

- [whispering prayer]
- [snarling intensifies]

33:48.270 --> 33:51.240
..and who he has redeemed,
at a great cost,

33:51.340 --> 33:53.350
the tyranny of the devil!

33:53.450 --> 33:54.650
Ah!

Five children, Peter.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.810
We've made every kind of test.

34:26.909 --> 34:30.380
There are no signs
of affected organs

34:30.480 --> 34:33.020
or of a virus.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.620
It doesn't make any sense.

34:34.719 --> 34:36.360
[door closes]

34:52.300 --> 34:53.550
[whispers in Spanish] God will welcome him
into His eternal light.

34:54.670 --> 34:55.880
God doesn't exist.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.100
Saints don't exist.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.860
[Peter and children
reciting prayer in Spanish]

35:15.740 --> 35:18.610
In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

35:19.530 --> 35:20.870
Amen.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.250
- Good night, children.
- Good night, father.

35:36.780 --> 35:39.520
[singing "Ave Maria"

36:08.290 --> 36:10.960
- [speaks Spanish] Merry Christmas, children.
- Merry Christmas, Sister Magali.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.300
Why does Baby Jesus forget
about orphan children?

36:21.050 --> 36:22.260
You really think so, Camila?

36:25.720 --> 36:27.100
Did you behave?

36:29.890 --> 36:31.770
Well, I don't think
he's forgotten about you.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.730
Yes, I saw him myself,
and guess what?

36:39.490 --> 36:41.150
He left something for you
under your bed.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.620
[all scream
and chatter excitedly]

36:52.220 --> 36:53.630
Thank you.

37:00.630 --> 37:02.430

37:13.940 --> 37:15.310
Sister Magali?

Camila.

[sighs]

37:40.210 --> 37:43.640
[inhaling and exhaling deeply]

The inmates have suffered
the influence of the evil one.

37:50.420 --> 37:52.180
[demonic snarling
over recording]

37:52.280 --> 37:53.920
I'm afraid there
could be a tragedy

37:54.020 --> 37:56.790
if Esperanza's transfer
to a juvenile facility...

37:56.890 --> 38:00.330
I mean, thank God because
of the ineptitude and red tape,

38:00.430 --> 38:03.230
they haven't
transferred her yet.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.800
You have all my support,
Father Peter.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.440
The Vatican
needs to approve...

38:09.540 --> 38:10.770
Just do it.

38:10.870 --> 38:13.040
We won't let
our own bureaucracy

38:13.140 --> 38:16.910
do away with the life
of this innocent girl.

38:17.010 --> 38:19.940
I've earned
the Vatican's trust,

38:20.040 --> 38:22.550
and they'll approve
on your exorcism.

38:23.780 --> 38:25.120
If you'll allow me,

38:25.220 --> 38:27.590
I'd like someone
to join me this time.

38:28.290 --> 38:30.520
You have someone in mind?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.410
Father Michael.
You made it.

38:46.510 --> 38:49.540
If I can make it to hell,
I can make it to Mexico.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.140
Which, according
to the <i>London Times,</i>

38:52.240 --> 38:54.250
is about the same.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.050
[both laugh]

38:58.150 --> 38:59.980
[drops luggage]

39:00.750 --> 39:02.490
[both grunt]

39:04.160 --> 39:05.460
[Peter]
Well, Magali could have died.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.590
[Michael]
You too.

39:07.690 --> 39:10.560
Why didn't you want to do
this exorcism alone?

39:10.660 --> 39:13.470
You're the greatest
exorcist in the world.

39:13.570 --> 39:14.730
[chuckles]

39:14.830 --> 39:17.440
And you faced Balban
and defeated it.

39:17.540 --> 39:19.100
So did you.

39:26.810 --> 39:28.150
I...

39:28.250 --> 39:30.220
I didn't defeat it,
Michael.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.750
What are you talking about?

39:34.950 --> 39:36.720
Balban left Magali,

39:36.820 --> 39:40.360
but then he came into me.

39:40.460 --> 39:42.130
And then?

39:42.230 --> 39:43.730
He just left.

39:43.830 --> 39:45.500
Impossible.

39:46.830 --> 39:50.070
Balban wouldn't have left
without taking your soul.

39:50.170 --> 39:53.610
The only explanation is,
you expelled it.

39:55.970 --> 39:59.380
You carry God
inside you, my boy.

40:21.030 --> 40:22.630
No!

Peter!

41:37.010 --> 41:38.880
[pounding on door continuous]

41:46.960 --> 41:47.710
My child!

41:48.120 --> 41:50.620
Oh, God. She's fine.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.757
Thank God that she's fine.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.010
[speaks Spanish]
Thank you, father.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.440
You are a saint.
God bless you.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.650
God bless you.

42:22.250 --> 42:23.660
Can't sleep?

42:23.760 --> 42:25.120
[sighs]

42:25.220 --> 42:27.330
- Nightmares?
- Hmm.

42:27.430 --> 42:29.660
[chuckles]
Here.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.300
Mescal.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.900
The best holy water
I've tasted in a while.

42:41.110 --> 42:42.810
[coughs]

42:42.910 --> 42:44.410
Come on.

42:44.510 --> 42:46.140
Tell me your nightmare.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.710
Hmm.

42:47.810 --> 42:50.420
Come on. Tell me.

42:53.050 --> 42:55.250
I see Jesus...

42:56.120 --> 42:57.760
possessed by the devil.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.430
He comes for me
every night.

43:00.530 --> 43:02.330
Strangles me, and...

43:03.260 --> 43:04.900
I can't even move.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.400
He wants you.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.300
Balban is trying
to possess you.

43:17.780 --> 43:19.310

[gasps]

43:44.270 --> 43:46.400
[loud crash overhead]

43:46.510 --> 43:48.210
Two thousand years ago,

43:48.310 --> 43:50.410
he tried to possess Christ...

43:51.110 --> 43:53.210
but he was defeated.

43:53.310 --> 43:56.250
Balban is a demon
with a noble lineage

43:56.350 --> 43:59.150
with legions of henchmen
under his command.

43:59.250 --> 44:00.590
If he's calling you,

44:00.690 --> 44:03.360
he's not doing it
without a purpose.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.660
You are part of his plan.

46:07.610 --> 46:10.050
[woman]
Time to play, children!

46:10.150 --> 46:14.290
Tomorrow, to free someone
who is totally possessed,

46:14.390 --> 46:17.160
we have to be
totally clean.

46:19.290 --> 46:21.790

I condemn you back to hell!

It's OK, don't worry.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.270
Faith, Camila.

Faith.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.940
[all breathing heavily]

48:35.390 --> 48:37.630
What the fuck
is this, Peter?

48:37.730 --> 48:39.800
It's a third-world prison.

48:39.900 --> 48:43.740
I don't know whether I should
spray holy water or bleach.

48:44.570 --> 48:46.640
[door hinges squealing]

[faint wheezing]

49:04.190 --> 49:06.660

They're sick.

49:09.890 --> 49:11.700
[cries]

49:15.630 --> 49:17.940
It's your fault, Father.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.700
Your fault.

49:21.440 --> 49:23.110
[in demonic voice]
I'll take them!

49:23.210 --> 49:26.350
I'll burn your damn
children down here!

49:26.450 --> 49:28.950
Not if I expel you first.

49:29.380 --> 49:30.550
Silence.

49:30.650 --> 49:33.620
Don't fall for her tricks.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.290
So...

49:38.390 --> 49:41.190
you're from "down there."

49:44.260 --> 49:45.900
Prove it.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.400
Come on, prove it.

49:51.770 --> 49:53.340
[chuckles]

49:53.440 --> 49:56.210
Well, gentlemen,
we have no demon.

49:56.310 --> 49:57.880
No possession.

49:58.980 --> 50:00.950
Let's go get a drink.

50:01.050 --> 50:05.080
Someone must have a mescal
in this shitty prison.

50:09.170 --> 50:10.880
- [guards speaks Spanish] Open up!
- [pounding on door] What's wrong?

50:11.790 --> 50:13.490
[faint wheezing]

50:13.590 --> 50:15.960
Simple telekinesis.

50:16.060 --> 50:18.130
I've seen that in village...

50:20.300 --> 50:22.770
[gurgles and gulps]

50:23.700 --> 50:25.400
[Peter]
Father, are you okay?

50:29.010 --> 50:31.310
Even if you were a demon...

50:32.410 --> 50:33.610
you'd be the lowliest kind.

50:33.710 --> 50:36.080
So simple,

50:36.180 --> 50:37.720
so predictable,

50:37.820 --> 50:41.390
that I would leave you to rot
with your cheap tricks.

50:43.190 --> 50:44.720
[Michael gasps]

50:46.090 --> 50:47.790

50:47.890 --> 50:51.400
We have a pact,
Father Michael.

50:52.570 --> 50:54.930
[giggles]

50:55.030 --> 50:58.770
In an hour, we will be
raping you down here.

it will be your fault!</i>

No!

51:09.850 --> 51:12.350
- [distant shrieking]
- [speaks Spanish] The inmates...

51:14.120 --> 51:17.260
[Peter] God, creator
and defender of humankind,

51:17.360 --> 51:20.660
turn your eyes to this servant,
Esperanza Valasquez,

51:20.760 --> 51:22.407
whom you have
redeemed...

51:22.450 --> 51:23.910
<i>A tree is known
by its fruit.</i>

51:24.260 --> 51:26.800
- [voices shrieking]
- [loud pounding and rumbling]

51:26.900 --> 51:29.070
...to make her strong
for the fight,

51:29.170 --> 51:33.240
and to defend her
with this powerful protection.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.170

51:39.110 --> 51:41.250

He kept in captivity...

51:56.560 --> 51:58.330

[snarls]

52:08.110 --> 52:10.310
Hallowed by thy name,

52:10.410 --> 52:11.840
thy kingdom come,

52:11.940 --> 52:13.280

52:38.840 --> 52:41.040
[Nelson]
Are you okay?

52:44.180 --> 52:46.280
[Michael]
Killed it.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.220
[speaks Spanish] Here you can do
whatever you want,

53:04.640 --> 53:05.680
we don't use this place
anymore.

53:06.930 --> 53:09.070
We need everyone
to leave.

53:09.170 --> 53:13.410
The prison must be empty
except for Esperanza and us.

53:14.150 --> 53:15.110
Your mother, just in case!

53:18.570 --> 53:20.200
- How many inmates are here?
- Thirteen.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.780
And four in maximum security,

53:25.200 --> 53:26.370
plus the possessed one.

53:27.620 --> 53:28.870
Mr Uribe,

53:30.660 --> 53:31.830
we need to get them
out of here.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.250
- Everyone must leave.
- No, sir, that's impossible.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.460
You saw it yourself,

53:40.050 --> 53:42.050
it's dangerous for them,
and for us.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.220
I don't know how things work
in your country,

53:47.100 --> 53:48.720
but it's different here,
and I don't want any trouble!

53:50.730 --> 53:52.770
The inmates stay put,
and so does my guard.

53:58.980 --> 54:01.450
I can put them
to sleep.

54:01.550 --> 54:03.520
[keys jangle]

54:11.730 --> 54:14.100
[Peter] Our prayers...

54:14.900 --> 54:16.300
they didn't hurt it.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.410
Balban is the demon
of deceit.

54:19.510 --> 54:23.180
You cannot believe anything
that comes from it.

54:23.280 --> 54:26.040
Not even what it
tells you about me.

54:26.140 --> 54:29.180
<i>It will always play
with our biggest fears.</i>

54:29.280 --> 54:31.550
<i>And even as it agonizes,</i>

54:31.650 --> 54:35.190
it will make us believe
it is still strong.

54:35.290 --> 54:39.290
It is the best weapon
to destroy our faith.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.870
<i>And, above all things,</i>

54:46.960 --> 54:48.970
<i>never make a deal with it.</i>

54:49.070 --> 54:52.540
If you do, he will always win.

54:54.170 --> 54:56.580
[mumbling prayer]

54:56.680 --> 54:58.940
[steam hisses]

55:16.230 --> 55:20.000
- [cell door slams]
- [lock clicks]

55:22.500 --> 55:25.240
[Michael]
<i>Demons reject holy water.</i>

55:25.340 --> 55:27.440
This will make it float
around the room.

55:27.540 --> 55:30.140
making it impossible
for Balban to jump

55:30.240 --> 55:33.110
from one body
to the next.

55:33.950 --> 55:36.220
I bet it's new.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.380
Doesn't have the Vatican
seal of approval.

55:39.490 --> 55:44.760
Peter, the conventional ritual
will not work against Balban.

55:46.060 --> 55:47.760
For centuries,
the Church has used

55:47.860 --> 55:50.760
the same ritual
in exorcisms.

55:50.860 --> 55:52.630
But the devil's
not a fool.

55:52.730 --> 55:54.070
He's learned.

55:54.170 --> 55:56.570
He won't fall twice
for the same trick.

55:56.670 --> 55:58.300
That's human.

55:59.840 --> 56:01.510
What has the Vatican done?

56:01.610 --> 56:03.010
[chuckles]

56:03.110 --> 56:04.710
Perfect the ritual?

56:04.810 --> 56:07.350
Plan a strategy through time?

56:07.450 --> 56:08.810
No.

56:08.910 --> 56:11.020
They send us into battle,

56:11.120 --> 56:12.720
but they leave us alone.

56:12.820 --> 56:16.290
Sometimes, I think the devil's
in the Vatican's own ranks.

56:16.390 --> 56:19.160
- Michael, that...
- Shh!

56:19.260 --> 56:22.230
The consequence of this
is the auteur exorcism.

56:22.330 --> 56:26.430
Each priest performs
the exorcism

56:26.530 --> 56:27.700
as he wants.

56:27.800 --> 56:31.100
The problem is,
many faithless priests hesitate.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.570
And that makes
the demon stronger.

56:35.540 --> 56:37.440
Michael, I...

56:37.540 --> 56:39.410
use that ritual.

56:39.510 --> 56:43.580
And only God and the devil
know why you're not dead.

56:45.050 --> 56:47.250
But without a ritual...

56:48.220 --> 56:49.420
how will I do it?

56:49.520 --> 56:53.190
By not believing
God is with you...

56:56.960 --> 57:01.070
but by believing
you are God.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.010
[Magali]
She wants to be an astronaut.

57:09.110 --> 57:10.840
Or a film director.

57:10.940 --> 57:12.950
She didn't pick
easy ones.

57:13.050 --> 57:14.710
[chuckles]

57:14.810 --> 57:16.280
She's obsessive.

57:16.380 --> 57:19.280
When she wants something,
she doesn't give up.

57:19.380 --> 57:21.790
She... She goes on and on,

57:21.890 --> 57:24.360
and you want to kill her.

57:24.460 --> 57:25.760
[laughs]

57:25.860 --> 57:28.690
But at the end,
she always gets what she wants.

57:30.630 --> 57:34.330
I've never met her
and my heart is already hers.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.110
Magali, I'm sorry.

57:42.210 --> 57:44.440
Forgive me.

57:44.540 --> 57:46.280
- I was hard on you.
- No.

57:46.380 --> 57:48.780
I let it in, Magali.

57:51.750 --> 57:54.150
I fell for its temptation.

57:55.550 --> 57:58.620
I had you in my arms,
and kissed you, and...

57:58.720 --> 58:00.330
Shh.

58:02.790 --> 58:03.900
[sighs]

58:04.000 --> 58:05.900
I thank God it happened.

58:09.330 --> 58:11.440
If not, I wouldn't have her.

58:11.540 --> 58:13.640
My gift.

58:14.670 --> 58:16.680
My miracle.

58:17.660 --> 58:18.660
My Esperanza (hope).

58:22.850 --> 58:24.650
For many years...

58:26.280 --> 58:28.890
I couldn't accept that...

58:28.990 --> 58:31.190
very deep down...

58:32.620 --> 58:35.690
I was falling in love with you
without realizing.

58:38.530 --> 58:40.270
I'm sorry.

59:07.460 --> 59:08.840
[speaks Spanish]
Every door is secured.

59:10.550 --> 59:12.760
- We'll be here in the morning.
- Alright.

59:15.010 --> 59:16.260
God bless you, father.

59:34.590 --> 59:36.220
Father...

59:38.960 --> 59:40.690
save her.

59:41.830 --> 59:44.330
I swear to God.

spoke to God last night.

[Michael]
And with your spirit.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.770
- He wants to kill my children.
- Silence.

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:40.110
I told you, you can't believe
anything from it.

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:43.840
It's just trying
to scare you.

01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:54.490
[all scream]

01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:56.760
Dear merciful God,

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:01.170
the prayer
of the Blessed Virgin Mary!

01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:04.240
[all shrieking]

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:06.340
[metal clanks]

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:16.780
Dying on the cross.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.050
Just the head
of ancient serpents.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.630
I declare you anathema,
Satan.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.160
Enemy of human salvation.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.560
[cackles]

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.630
[Michael] And entrusted
to his mother.

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:37.200
Omen has a son!

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.900
[all roaring]

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:51.080
St. Michael.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:54.190
Archangel.

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.760
Prince of heaven...

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.030
[sizzling]

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:14.110
Fair trial sentenced your pride
and your envy...

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:18.740
Go back to hell!

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.450
- Go back to hell!
- [growls]

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:27.350
No! No!

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.020
Michael!

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.790
Come on!

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.569
[panting]

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:41.300
- [demonic snarling]
- Ah!

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.840
[yells]

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:56.109
[screams]

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.319
- You all right?
- Yes!

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.550
Yes! Run!

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.160
[demonic shrieking]

01:09:18.569 --> 01:09:20.910
- [panting]
- [demonic shrieking]

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:34.920
- [latch clicks]
- [pounding on door]

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.000
[panting]

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.040
You okay?

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.370
What...?

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:55.840
You lied to me!

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.040
What are you talking about?

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.880
Your prayer,
it didn't work.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.210
What sin are you
carrying with you?

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.510
Speak!

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:04.520
[panting]

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.450
Esperanza.

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:11.390
Eighteen years ago...

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:13.120
She's your daughter.

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.230
God, Peter,
what have you done?

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:18.130
It wasn't me. I was possessed.
It was Balban.

01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:21.370
- Your sin let him in!
- It wasn't me!

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:24.400
I told you,
you weren't ready.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.940
- What did you want me to do?
- What about confessing?

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.640
God would have
forgiven you!

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.940
I did. I confessed.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.010
But I couldn't fulfill
my penance.

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:33.980
Now you'll never be able
to defeat Balban

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.520
or save the children
or your daughter!

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.780
You can do it.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.420
You can exorcise them.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.120
You defeated Balban once.

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.020
[laughs]

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.160
Peter, Balban didn't lie.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.790
In order to save
the possessed child,

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:50.360
I had to make a deal with him.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.530
I sold my soul to him

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:55.200
and lost all power over him.

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:57.070
[loud crashing]

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:59.270
They're waiting for me,
Peter.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.970
When I die...

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:06.650
I'm going to burn in...

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:14.390
- [loud crashing continuous]
- [objects clattering]

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.330
- Stand up.
- No, no, no.

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:23.730
Stand.

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:25.700
I'm sorry.

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:30.700
Stand up! Stand up!

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.370
[loud crashing
and banging continuous]

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.480
Peter...

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.880
Balban will tempt you
by using your biggest weakness.

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.850
But you already know
the only rule.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:46.320
Don't make a deal with him.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.590
[whimpers]

01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:52.830
There is no place for God
and the devil

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:54.690
in the same body.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.330
Always remember that.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.000
Let me go.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.730
No, no, no, no.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.070
[loud crash]

01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:06.510
[demonic shrieking]

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.350
- [loud pounding continuous]
- [panting]

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:22.020
[pounding and crashing stops]

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.660
[muffled snarling]

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.300
[object dragging along ground]

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:50.220
[sobbing softly]

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:08.570
I'm Father Peter.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.400
Peter Williams.

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:18.210
Eighteen years ago,
while I performed an exorcism...

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.350
on Magali Valasquez, I...

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.320
was tempted by Balban.

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:30.190
And I was...

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:33.560
dominated by own feelings,
and...

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:38.000
my forbidden desires for her.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.800
So...

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.100
I broke my vows with God...

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.910
and Balban
took advantage of this

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.110
to possess me

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.380
and sexually abuse her.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.750
The fruit of this sin

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:02.620
is that her...

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.420
daughter, Esperanza...

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.700
my daughter.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.340
<i>I destroyed the videotape
that proves my crime,</i>

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.470
<i>but this confession</i>

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:22.740
<i>will help justice
to be served on Earth,</i>

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:25.280
<i>as in heaven.</i>

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.580
[children laughing]

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:37.760

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:42.460
[all laughing]

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:45.630
[applause]

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:48.860
[woman speaks Spanish]
God doesn't exist.

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:51.610
Saints don't exist.

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:55.340
Save her.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.550
[phone beeps]

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.150
[cell door opens]

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:11.190
[demonic voices moaning
and snarling]

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:17.757
<i>Stay back, Satan!</i>

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.770
[all scream]

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:23.100
Under the Almighty's authority,

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.510
I command you to leave
these daughters of God.

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:29.540
- God is inside.
- [all shriek]

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.610
Jesus is inside

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:33.010
and the Holy Spirit
is inside.

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:34.880
[object dragging along ground]

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:49.730

01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:03.540
[shrieks]

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.960
Kneel before God!

01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:23.300
It is God who commands you.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.930
The Holy Spirit commands you.

01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:27.870
The church, the virgin,

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:29.670
the saints, and the archangels...

01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:31.400
[roars]

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:34.770
[breathing heavily]

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.550

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:53.660
[deep, animalistic breathing]

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.270
[demonic chuckle]

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.510
The Easter will bring
a miracle.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:13.880
Resurrection of
the possessed messiah.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.250
- [sizzles]
- [screams]

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:17.920
Our Father walks in hell.

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.850
Hallowed by thy name.

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:22.050
Thy kingdom come.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.720
Thy will be done
on Earth,

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.320
as it is in hell!

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.030
[screaming]

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.230
Lead us into temptation

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:37.070
and deliver us
towards evil.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.540
Amen.

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.840
God is within me.

01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:46.140
And that's why

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:49.610
I'm going to take him
out of you.

01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:50.780
[gasps]

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.720

[ghostly breathing echoes]

01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:39.530
Satan lo made the
eternal torment of sin

01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:41.470
sprout from the darkness

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:44.500
in order to destroy mankind.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.210
Listen to our prayers
with all thy wickedness,

01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:50.180
and infuse all thy power
in this blood!

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.480
[screams]

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:52.840
By serving thy purpose,

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.910
the sanctity of
the angels is averted.

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:58.120
Bringing upon doubt,

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.490
the seed of all sin.

01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:03.860
[all]
God, leave this body!

No!

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.880
In the name of Satan,

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:03.720
I command you to leave
this man's body!

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.180

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.510

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.450
The nine circles of hell

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:44.660
Darkness commands you!

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.730
Leave the soul
of this innocent girl.

01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:49.530
The power of Christ
compels you!

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.700

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.530
Free my daughter now.

01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:31.900
Lucifer's slave.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.970
Our daughter.

Let me in!

origin of our soul
and of our life,

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.100
bestow your blessing
on this woman!

Mary, full of grace.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.390
[Peter]
In the name of God,

01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:23.420
the Father, the Son,

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.420
the Holy Spirit,

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.690
I command you

01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:30.500
to leave my daughter, Esperanza.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.300
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll do it.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.700
But you just need to consider
something before...

01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:45.380
[screams]

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.820
[heart monitor flatlines]

01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:58.220
[heart monitor flatlines]

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.690
No.

01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.330
[demonic laughter]

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.630
If you expel me,

01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:08.530
they all come with me
to hell.

01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:09.900
No!

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.440
Time to make a choice,
Father Peter.

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.640
[slurps]

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.370
You daughter...

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.150
or all those innocent
children of God.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:23.380
No, damn you,
you son of a bitch!

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.680
- [gasping and choking]
- [snarling]

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:32.020
Your daughter or the children.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.930
Decide now.

01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:35.130
No.

01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:37.000
No, no.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.330
What do you want?

01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:44.000
What do you want?

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.080
I want you to let God

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.110
exit your body.

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.590
If you do it,

01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:09.030
all your children
will be saved.

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.460
[cries]

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
[Esperanza chuckles]

01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:21.370
And you'll save
my daughter too?

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.020
I will free Esperanza
and all the children.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.190
Deal.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.200
[cackling]

01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:49.030
- [screams]
- [shrieks]

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:52.470
Let the will of the Lord
be done.

01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:13.790
[heart monitors beeping]

01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:15.930

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.950
[Magali]
Thank you, Father.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.520
You're a true saint.

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.330
[bells tolling]

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.220
[Peter, speaks in Spanish]
Do not be deceived,

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.640
neither the sexually immoral,

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.020
nor idolaters,

01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:12.060
nor adulterers or perverts,

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.320
nor sodomites or homosexuals,

01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:23.570
nor thieves, drunks,
swindlers, or slanderers,

01:27:25.450 --> 01:27:27.120
none of them will inherit
the kingdom of God.

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:29.160
[applause]

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:56.060
[reporter speaking Spanish] The whole world is talking
about Peter Williams,

01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.230
the gringo priest who cured
112 sick children,

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.860
by just placing his hands
on top of them.

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:04.860
Are we in the presence
of a living saint?

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.700
[indistinct chattering]

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.540
May God be with you,
God bless you.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.500
May God be with you.

01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:35.760
The video?

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:38.400
I deleted it.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:41.730
Our confession is bound
by the sacred seal.

01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:45.440
Your actions
reached important ears.

01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:50.680
There's a job
as a special counselor

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.080
waiting for you
at the Vatican.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.620
This way.

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:00.670
Bless me, father.

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.390
May God be with you.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.680
[Peter speaks Spanish]
And with your spirit.

01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:21.860
Thank you.

01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:30.520
[giggles]

01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:48.770
Glory be thy honor,
Prince Balban...

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.240
for defeating the man

01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:54.340
who would have become
a living saint.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.510
The priest sacrificed God

01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:59.080
to save his daughter
and the children.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.510
The way I see it,
he is a living saint.

01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:17.560
Heaven's played
its cards too.

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.600
[indistinct chatter]

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.840
How did I not
see that coming?

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.240
[inaudible]

01:30:31.210 --> 01:30:34.850
We'll take care of God's
new chosen one later on.

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.870

the kingdom of God.</i>

01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:59.970
