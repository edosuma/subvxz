[coughs]

01:15.760 --> 01:18.479
[vehicle approaching]

01:39.910 --> 01:41.923
Howdy.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.021
-You lost?
-No.

01:45.950 --> 01:47.952
Don't see folks
out this way much.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.111
That's a lot
of dead prairie dogs.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.151
It's just target practice.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.823
You know, my grandfather
used to say,

02:01.930 --> 02:03.306
"If you kill all
the prairie dogs,

02:03.410 --> 02:05.401
there'd be no one left
to cry for the rain."

02:06.170 --> 02:07.387
Prairie dogs don't
make it rain.

02:07.490 --> 02:09.117
It's because they burrow,

02:09.220 --> 02:10.756
and then that turns the earth.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.669
They keep it from
getting too hard-packed.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.270
And that way,
when it rains,

02:14.380 --> 02:16.371
the water can get in
and make things grow.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.924
[chuckles]

02:19.030 --> 02:20.964
Did I say something funny?

02:21.070 --> 02:23.049
It's always funny
to listen to the white man

02:23.150 --> 02:25.141
explain how the world works.

02:26.390 --> 02:28.779
Still, hard to imagine

02:28.880 --> 02:31.656
coming all this way
to see prairie dogs.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.751
What can I say?
I dislike prairie dogs.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.566
Can't find something you
dislike closer to home?

02:43.610 --> 02:45.066
Y'all army or something?

02:45.170 --> 02:47.354
Heard they was lettin'
was lettin' girls in.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.849
Didn't realize they was
letting in little,
pretty ones.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.720
What...

02:58.830 --> 03:00.821
I was handling it.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.872
[man groaning]

03:10.120 --> 03:12.111
Psycho.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.493
[Sam]
Target is
at seven 0 ’c/ock.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.659
The brunette.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.772
I need confirmation.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.939
No, no, Sam.
You're a fucking idiot.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.427
Joe, the fate of humanity
rests on the line.

04:38.530 --> 04:39.827
Oh, the fate of humanity?

04:39.930 --> 04:41.500
The fate of your sperm aanay.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.225
Dude, why don't you go
and pick her up?

04:43.330 --> 04:44.820
Because he knows I'd
cut his balls off.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.830
She would,
she'll cut off my balls,
and I need my balls,

04:46.940 --> 04:48.931
which is why I have
to live vicariously
through your balls, Joe,

04:49.300 --> 04:50.756
which frankly sucks.

04:50.860 --> 04:53.078
Baby, tell Joe to hit
on the brunette, please.

04:53.180 --> 04:55.887
-First, let's do some shots.
-Yes.

04:55.990 --> 04:58.447
-How long ago did you break up
with whatsherface?
-Who's "whatsherface?"

04:58.550 --> 05:00.609
Can I get three shots
of tequila, please? Thank you.

05:00.710 --> 05:03.167
_ -Janice.
-Jan|ce, the girl you're
still bent out of shape over.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.295
That was six years ago.
I'm not bent _
out of shape over Janice.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.459
If you don't date for
six years after your break-up
with someone,

05:07.560 --> 05:09.699
you're bent
out of shape over her
whether you know it or not.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.858
Hey, what are you doing
with my phone?

05:10.960 --> 05:12.894
-I'm on Tinder.
-No, no, no, no, no.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.900
Finding Joe a girl.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.864
Why can't the three of us
just hang out, huh?

05:16.970 --> 05:19.825
'Cause you're a third wheel,
baby, and we don't enjoy
hanging out with you.

05:19.930 --> 05:22.228
-[Mae] What about Melanie?
-Give me my phone.
I'm not kidding.

05:22.330 --> 05:23.422
No, no. No, Mae.

05:23.530 --> 05:24.679
Oh, no, never mind.

05:24.780 --> 05:26.634
-You know what?
-Selfie with a baby tiger.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.310
Even the kids
are worried about you, Joe.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.718
Jude says to me the other night
when I put him to bed,

05:30.820 --> 05:33.869
he looks up with me
through his sad little eyes,
and he says,

05:33.980 --> 05:36.687
"Daddy, I'm worried
that Uncle Joe is lonely."

05:36.790 --> 05:38.724
You're such a shitter.
No, he didn't.

05:39.910 --> 05:41.844
He said it to me while
I was putting him to bed.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.360
Yeah, right.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.017
You haven't been home
to put the kids to bed
in two years.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.259
[Sam] Hmm, thanks, Babe.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.658
Just personalizing
the story for effect.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.375
Being in a relationship
is like being in a cult.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.301
When you're in one,
you want every one else
to be in one with you.

05:54.410 --> 05:56.139
Yeah, because it's
beautiful, Joe.

05:56.250 --> 05:59.026
Okay, I'm gonna take
my sweet wife home.

05:59.130 --> 06:00.939
I'm gonna make
tender love to her,

06:01.050 --> 06:03.860
to my wife, to this woman
who I share a rich life with,

06:03.970 --> 06:06.029
we share a family.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.473
Show her my innermost secrets,
my hopes, my dreams.

06:09.580 --> 06:12.037
You, on the other hand,
you're gonna go home in
your shitty little apartment,

06:12.140 --> 06:14.165
you're gonna eat cold pizza,
and jerk off into a pillow.

06:14.270 --> 06:15.965
Dude, I don't have any pizza.

06:16.070 --> 06:17.924
-[Sam laughing]
-[Mae] Okay, I just found
your wife.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.281
She's perfect for you.

06:19.390 --> 06:21.278
-Let me see.
-And you're a match.

06:21.390 --> 06:22.926
[Sam] Let me see. Kathy H.?

06:23.030 --> 06:25.032
-She's pretty.
-Let me see, let me see.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.612
She's pretty.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.857
Yeah.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.497
Kathy H. is gonna
change your life.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.737
Do you wanna have
a drink tomorrow?

06:32.840 --> 06:34.182
No, no, no, no.
Don't send anything.

06:34.290 --> 06:35.860
Did you send it?

06:35.970 --> 06:37.904
Jesus. You sent it?

06:38.010 --> 06:40.547
-To Kathy H.
-To Kathy H.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.948
Geez. To Kathy H.

06:43.050 --> 06:45.052
[Mae] Yeah.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.334
[horn honking]

06:53.020 --> 06:55.022
Shut up.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.952

07:08.640 --> 07:10.631

[Joe] Hey, Sam.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.291
[5am]
Hey, buddy,
pick up your pace.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.209
You ’re not even running
an eight-m/hute m/7e.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.880
Listen, I need you to come
over nereland look at
sometn/ng for me.

07:54.450 --> 07:55.508
No can do.

07:55.610 --> 07:57.464
Your wife hacked
my dating life, remember?

07:57.570 --> 08:00.789
[5am]
Yea/7, well,
it’s important.
I need your advice, Joe.

08:00.890 --> 08:04.189
Okay, sure. I can be
at your place in an hour.
Everything cool?

08:04.300 --> 08:05.949
[5am]
I actually need you
at the ofﬁce.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.073
[Joe] You want me
to come to your office?

08:08.180 --> 08:10.899
[5am]
What I want is for you
to take those stairs up
ahead on the leﬁ‘.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.684
Sam, are you tracking my phone?

08:14.790 --> 08:16.781
Not a good time
to stop, Pal.

08:17.270 --> 08:19.261
Pick it up, Joe. Move.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.616
Come on, buddy, two at a time.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.018
Take a left- to the top
of the stairs.
-[pa nting]

08:29.120 --> 08:31.111
What's going on, Sam?

08:33.330 --> 08:35.423
[5am]
Get in that van that’s
right in front of you.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.521
[Joe] What van?

08:39.210 --> 08:41.201
[Sam] Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

08:57.190 --> 08:58.248
Who are we gonna see?

08:58.350 --> 09:00.443
Your Uncle Bob
and the Deputy Director.

09:00.550 --> 09:01.733
Of the CIA?

09:01.840 --> 09:03.137
-Of the CIA.
-Yeah?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.891
Two years ago,
you wrote a program
with Harold Floros

09:06.000 --> 09:08.093
to help screen employees
at likely terrorist targets

09:08.200 --> 09:09.974
in the Middle East and Europe
to assess the threat potential.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.388
-Do you remember that?
-Yeah.

09:11.490 --> 09:13.060
You know, I didn't think
anyone ever looked
at that thing.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.148
The program is operational?

09:14.250 --> 09:16.104
It's operational, Joe,
and it works.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.940
And you have a chance
to save a lot of lives today.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.041
We flagged this guy,
Ammar Nazari.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.651
[praying in Arabic]

09:24.860 --> 09:28.114
[speaking in Arabic]

09:28.220 --> 09:30.211
[5am] N
azari is
a Saudi national.

09:31.910 --> 09:33.901
Thirty-two years old.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.480
Before your program
found this guy,

09:37.590 --> 09:40.127
we ’0' never heard of him.

09:40.230 --> 09:42.835
. He’s a fresh face .
/n the 5mm terror commun/ty.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.539
[Sam] Here we go.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.631
Welcome to the big
leagues, Joe.

09:53.650 --> 09:55.641
Let me show you something.

09:58.490 --> 10:00.026
There it is.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.519
This is everything
we've got on Nazari.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.599
Now, we've been watching him
for the past six weeks.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.476
He's clean, until noon today
when he goes to a PO box

10:07.580 --> 10:09.593
that no one knew he had,
and picks up a package.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.849
What's in the package?

10:10.950 --> 10:12.986
That's the problem, Joe.
We have no fucking idea.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.380
Yeah. We didn't have
time to do a sweep.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.255
Sam, is that ComQuest Field?

10:21.360 --> 10:23.578
Mmm-hmm. That's where Nazari's
been working as a janitor
for the past six weeks

10:23.680 --> 10:25.136
until your program flagged him.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.128
The program I designed
was supposed to
screen employees

10:27.240 --> 10:29.128
with high profile targets
in the Middle East and Europe.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.265
-[both stammering]
-Joe.

10:31.370 --> 10:33.144
Your uncle has been running
with this all by himself.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.229
-Bob is running this?
-We had no idea.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.548
If you have an issue with it,
you take it up with him, but
you do it on your own time.

10:37.650 --> 10:39.584
Nazari, right now,
is on his way

10:39.690 --> 10:42.591
to a stadium filled
with people as we speak.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.713
So, you have a state trooper
pull him over.

10:44.820 --> 10:45.832
You search the car.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.749
What if he detonates it?

10:47.860 --> 10:49.885
-Detonates what?
-Exactly.

10:49.990 --> 10:51.366
What is it?

10:51.470 --> 10:53.358
Is it nuclear,
biological, chemical?
We don't know what,

10:53.470 --> 10:55.449
Why are we gonna give this guy
a chance to pull the trigger?

10:55.550 --> 10:57.199
Okay.

10:57.310 --> 10:58.766
Wait.

10:58.870 --> 11:01.612
You're gonna kill him,
aren't you?
That's what this is.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.210
That's what this
room IS, right?

11:03.320 --> 11:04.969
That's why you're here.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.059
Yeah, we wanna hear
every perspective...

11:07.160 --> 11:09.628
-This is fucking crazy.
-...before we act on it.

11:09.730 --> 11:11.846
Subject is just over
one mile from the target.

11:13.010 --> 11:15.103
Is it a target, Mr. Turner?

11:15.210 --> 11:19.260
Joe, this is Mr. Abbott,
Deputy Director of the CIA.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.395
[Abbott] Well, is it?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.479
Uh...

11:23.580 --> 11:27.232
The algorithm only looks
at employees of high
profile targets, Mr. Abbott.

11:27.340 --> 11:30.480
So the question isn't so much
if ComQuest Field is a target,

11:30.590 --> 11:32.763
but more if Ammar Nazari
is a threat.

11:32.870 --> 11:36.647
Your algorithm gave Mr. Nazari
a 12% threat probability.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.696
Yes, but the algorithm
wasn't designed to be used
in this country,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.939
so there are variables
that will need to be adjusted

11:42.040 --> 11:43.894
to make the program actionable.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.491
[tech] The subject is
getting off I-495.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.309
A Saudi-born American_ citizen
who IS also a Muslim,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.662
just visited a secret
safety deposit box,

11:52.770 --> 11:55.125
and is on his way now
to a football stadium.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.201
How many variables do we need?

11:59.700 --> 12:01.839
But with all due respect,
uh, Mr. Abbott,

12:01.940 --> 12:04.591
Muslim-Americans are allowed
to have PO boxes

12:04.700 --> 12:06.691
and also work
in football stadiums.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.982
-[Sam] Sir?
-Excuse me.

12:14.470 --> 12:17.143
What would you do
if this was your play?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.937
[stuttering] I don't know.
How could I...

12:22.040 --> 12:24.816
We don't have enough
time to not know.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.911
[tech] Subject is pulling in
to the stadium parking lot.

12:28.370 --> 12:29.906
Subject is parking.

12:30.010 --> 12:33.821
[soldier]
Shadow 1 Bravo engaging. Over.

12:33.930 --> 12:36.660
You're talking about killing
a_ man without _
any evrdence against him,

12:36.770 --> 12:39.398
except for an algorithm
that I wrote years ago

12:39.500 --> 12:42.116
and subsequently forgot about.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.348
Now forgive me for taking
a second to contemplate
the 88% likelihood

12:45.460 --> 12:48.042
that this man is guilty
of nothing more than coming
from the wrong country

12:48.150 --> 12:49.185
and applying for
the wrong fucking job.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.044
You wrote the program, Joe.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.766
Yeah, I did, so you guys
would know who to look at,

12:53.870 --> 12:56.759
but not through the scope
of a fucking sniper rifle.

12:56.870 --> 12:58.895
[Abbott] Enough dithering
with your nephew, Bob.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.410
Let's get on with this.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.569
He's the reason we're here.
His program found this man.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.695
A man we suspect of being
a terrorist is about
to walk a package,

13:06.800 --> 13:08.540
whose contents
are unknown to us,

13:08.650 --> 13:12.746
into a football stadium
packed with 80, 000
American sou/s.

13:12.850 --> 13:14.841
[tech] Subject's car door
is open.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.598
Thank you for
your valuable service,
Mr. Turner.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.315
We should have more
young men like you.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.229
We'll take it from here.
Thank you.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.955
-[Sam] Joe.
-Okay.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.688
[Sam] Let's go, Joe.

13:29.790 --> 13:32.224
[tech] Sir, team leader
wants to know _if
we have a green light.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.101
[opening door]

13:48.450 --> 13:50.441
[sighs]

14:06.700 --> 14:08.702
[indistinct conversation
on television]

14:20.120 --> 14:22.850
- You know, the head coach
and his offense coord/nator...
-[cell phone line rings]

14:22.960 --> 14:25.451
[Sam's voice]
You ’ve reached Sam Barber.
Please leave a message.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.664
-[beep]
-Sam, it's me.

14:27.770 --> 14:29.988
What the fuck was that?

14:30.090 --> 14:32.229
I mean,
are those people
safe or not?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.981
I'm just standing here,
watching the fucking TV.
Can you call me, please?

14:35.090 --> 14:36.751
[indistinct conversation
continues]

14:36.860 --> 14:37.792
Bye.

14:37.900 --> 14:38.992
[beeps]

14:39.100 --> 14:40.954
[commentator]
And that parts been top-down.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.756
Which is why we saw
a change com/ng
into this season.

14:43.860 --> 14:47.239
But you can ’t change
the culture of a football
team overn/ght.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.806
These things take time.

14:50.950 --> 14:52.781
you ’re looking at a group
of young men who are
physically outmatching. . .

14:52.870 --> 14:54.246
[Joe] Oh, shit.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.352
[commentator]
That takes a toll.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.530
Big challenge for
the new coaching reg/me,

14:58.640 --> 15:00.631
trying to ride this ship.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.271
All right now,
first down /n mid-field.

15:08.610 --> 15:10.601
[indistinct chatter]

15:14.530 --> 15:19.229
So, after the diagnosis,
my aunt started seeing
this energy healer.

15:19.340 --> 15:22.468
So, one day, I went with her,
and he shook my hand,

15:22.580 --> 15:25.117
and said, "You have the gift.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.528
You're a healer.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.519
That's what you're meant
to do with your life."

15:29.630 --> 15:33.919
He said that he could
teach me how to harness
the power of my gift, and...

15:34.030 --> 15:36.578
You know, use it
in a positive way.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.638
So, uh, that's what you do?
You're a... A healer?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.094
I'm a lawyer.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.497
Uh-huh.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.501
[commentator speaking
indistinctly on television]

15:47.610 --> 15:49.726
That's usually the part
of the story
where people laugh.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.276
You... Big football fan?

15:56.380 --> 15:57.551
-Uh,no.
-Degenerate gambler?

15:57.660 --> 15:59.673
-No, I have--
-'Cause this is
a new one for me.

15:59.780 --> 16:02.317
Losing a guy's interest
to football in the first date.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.411
I hate football.
I couldn't ev_en_
tell you who's Winning.

16:05.870 --> 16:07.679
-Is that supposed
to make me feel better?
-Yeah.

16:07.790 --> 16:09.883
No, uh...

16:09.990 --> 16:11.446
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:11.550 --> 16:13.563
Uh...

16:13.670 --> 16:15.672
What kind of law
do you practice?

16:18.040 --> 16:20.577
-Intellectual property.
-Okay.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.537
I have some semi-conductor
clients here in the US

16:24.640 --> 16:26.744
whose US patents
are being knocked off

16:26.850 --> 16:29.125
in, uh, China and Korea
and...

16:33.490 --> 16:35.492
I'd rather not drink alone.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.271
[sighs]

16:39.380 --> 16:41.371
God.

16:46.950 --> 16:48.565
[Joe] Wait.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.604
Wait, wait.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.564
Look, I'm sorry.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.570
I'm just glad something
you're interested in
wasn't on.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.931
I really am sorry.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.031
Today...
Today was a bad...

16:58.960 --> 17:00.951
It was a weird fucking day.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.974
And the truth is,

17:04.080 --> 17:06.082
I meant to cancel our date,
but I forgot.

17:08.770 --> 17:10.829
Well, why didn't you
just start with that?

17:10.930 --> 17:12.989
Yeah.

17:13.090 --> 17:15.376
Yeah, in hindsight,
that was the obvious move.

17:19.340 --> 17:20.671
Look, it's already late,

17:20.780 --> 17:22.771
but I just live
a few blocks from here.

17:26.270 --> 17:27.840
I mean if you wanna
walk me home.

17:27.950 --> 17:29.941
Yeah.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.621
All right.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.871
Why was today a bad day?

17:38.080 --> 17:40.071
Something happened. Work.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.817
What?

17:41.920 --> 17:44.639
I, uh... I can't really...
I can't really talk about it.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.420
Yeah.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.760
Everyone I know has
to sign NDAs now.

17:50.450 --> 17:52.441
Yeah.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.771
Wait, so what do you do?

17:58.100 --> 18:00.489
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.782
'Cause I'm gonna quit tomorrow.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.381
[Kathy] Do you go on
a lot of these?

18:08.950 --> 18:10.406
Dates? [chuckles]

18:10.510 --> 18:12.626
Uh, I text people.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.817
And I fantasize they'd
be amazing. [laughs]

18:17.920 --> 18:21.617
Basically have an entire
imaginary relationship

18:21.720 --> 18:24.143
that ends in a breakup
before they can even
text you back.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.706
-You got it.
-[chuckles]

18:28.690 --> 18:30.624
[both laugh]

18:30.730 --> 18:32.721
Me, neither. [chuckles]

18:36.940 --> 18:38.931
How are you single?

18:39.380 --> 18:41.371
-[Kathy chuckles]
-That was a line.

18:44.150 --> 18:48.086
Takes too long really
get to know someone.

18:48.190 --> 18:51.466
-[Joe] Mmm-hmm.
-That person is never as good
as the one you imagined.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.831
Sometimes you get hurt.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.495
You know...

18:58.600 --> 19:00.613
If we were a rational culture,

19:00.720 --> 19:02.938
we would begin
every first date by saying,

19:03.050 --> 19:04.506
"Here's what's wrong with me."

19:04.610 --> 19:06.146
-Let's just get it out
of the way, huh?
-Yup.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.501
This is me.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.601
Okay.

19:10.810 --> 19:12.471
So fine...

19:12.580 --> 19:14.195
-Tell me.
-What?

19:14.300 --> 19:15.676
What's wrong with you?

19:15.780 --> 19:17.771
[chuckles]

19:18.220 --> 19:19.756
[Kathy] Come on.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.634
What? I'm a stranger.

19:21.740 --> 19:23.742
You're never gonna
see me again.

19:24.550 --> 19:26.563
You're not gonna see me again?

19:26.670 --> 19:28.661
You think I'd go
on a second date with you?

19:29.030 --> 19:30.566
Come on.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.456
I know this cozy
little sports bar.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.448
It's a few blocks from here.
You'd love it.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.551
[chuckles]

19:37.080 --> 19:38.650
Okay.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.751
Okay?

19:41.560 --> 19:43.187
Okay.

19:43.290 --> 19:45.281
All right.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.441
[cell phone vibrating]

19:59.100 --> 20:01.091
[beeps]

20:01.790 --> 20:03.769
Hello.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.486
[Bob] I imagine you must
be pissed at me.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.581
[Joe]
lfou don ’t ha ve
to /mag/ne too hard.

20:09.790 --> 20:12.315
I can't be part of a program
whose mission I...

20:13.840 --> 20:15.831
No longer believe in.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.332
You're not the only one
who believes that spying

20:19.440 --> 20:23.342
on American citizens
is wrong, Joe.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.987
Yeah, but I am the only one
whose belief that it's wrong

20:26.090 --> 20:27.785
stops him from doing it.

20:27.890 --> 20:30.063
Sometimes, you have
to do the wrong thing.

20:30.170 --> 20:31.831
[Joe sighs]

20:31.940 --> 20:34.158
Why is that?

20:34.260 --> 20:36.797
So you don't have to do
the worse thing later.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.357
See, you keep moving
the line, Bob.

20:39.460 --> 20:41.599
That's your problem.

20:41.710 --> 20:43.701
Or maybe it's your talent.
I don't know.

20:44.830 --> 20:46.821
But I...
I can't do this anymore.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.501
I out.

20:49.950 --> 20:52.373
Sometimes a man's conflicted

20:52.480 --> 20:56.576
only because it's in his nature
to be conflicted,

20:56.680 --> 20:59.513
which is what makes him
so damn good at what he does.

21:01.930 --> 21:03.739
It's the people
who don't have that

21:03.850 --> 21:07.820
dissenting a voice
inside them that
are truly dangerous.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.307
[Joe]
That dissenting
voice doesn ’1‘ mean much

21:10.410 --> 21:13.959
if the dangerous people
you work for aren't
willing to hear it.

21:14.060 --> 21:16.051
We're in a crowded theater.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.771
It's on fire.

21:19.220 --> 21:21.700
All we can do is yell
as loud as we can.

21:23.510 --> 21:24.807
I'm sorry, Bob.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.003
You did a good thing, Joe.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.759
[Joe]
Yeah, I don ’t know
what that means,

21:28.870 --> 21:30.007
and I don ’t wanna know.

21:30.110 --> 21:32.658
Turn on the TV.
We'll talk
about it tomorrow.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.330
I'm out, I mean it.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.431
Any channel.

21:42.770 --> 21:44.761
Did I wake you, sweetheart?

21:53.620 --> 21:58.068
The airborne or pneumonic
type of the plague virus
that was found on lVazan,

21:58.180 --> 22:01.286
is the rarest and deadliest
form of the disease.

22:01.390 --> 22:06.009
With a mortality rate
of close to J 00%
if left untreated.

22:06.110 --> 22:09.853
Had Nazari been allowed
to release this bio-weapon
undetected;

22:09.960 --> 22:15.455
those 80, 000 people
might now be back /n
their homes or ofﬁces

22:15.560 --> 22:17.858
unwitt/ng/y infecung
thousands.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.962
[reporter]
The FBI
is call/ng this
an act of terrorism.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.726
[panﬁng]

22:29.460 --> 22:31.451
[alarm buzzes]

22:38.020 --> 22:40.488
I mean the guy IPO'd at 24
and retired at 28.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.603
Now he just sails around
on his boat, you know,

22:42.710 --> 22:44.849
following the warm weather
like some kind of bird.

22:44.950 --> 22:46.929
-Turner, Joseph. 8:22
-Oh, God.

22:47.030 --> 22:49.851
Ellie, leave Harold alone.
He has work to do.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.609
[Harold] It's still
early right now.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.779
[Harold] The resolve
is melting, Joe.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.394
-[Joe] Faster or slower
the polar ice caps?
-[Harold laughs]

22:58.040 --> 22:59.905
Good morning, Colonel.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.784
[Harold] See, I'm playing
a long game here, Joe.

23:01.890 --> 23:04.939
I'm gonna win
to the Christmas party,
and then I make my big move.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.063
What happens
at the Christmas party?

23:07.170 --> 23:08.910
I break out my secret weapon.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.978
Colonel, do you see
a, uh, secret weapon
anywhere on Harold?

23:13.020 --> 23:15.011
No?

23:15.540 --> 23:17.872
You need a calling card,
something to distinguish you.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.084
[Harold] I don't need
a calling card. What I'm
saying is this is my home.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.327
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, listen.

23:21.430 --> 23:22.920
I'm a fantastic dancer, okay?

23:23.030 --> 23:25.919
Women respond to this
on a primal level.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.123
Do you get that? I mean,
they can't help themselves.

23:28.230 --> 23:31.529
I lived with the Makalanga
for a year, all right?

23:31.640 --> 23:32.891
They taught me how to dance.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.412
Surely you want Ellie
to like you for your mind.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.659
-Listen, attraction
is instinctual.
-[Sarah] There you are.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.944
In our base programming,
we're still primates.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.939
And the big monkey gets
all the hugs. Great.

23:43.050 --> 23:46.406
Only 'cause his algorithms
saved a few hundred thousand
lives last night.

23:48.740 --> 23:51.391
What's that now?
Comquest Field... That was...

23:51.500 --> 23:52.956
Thanks for telling me. That's--

23:53.060 --> 23:54.948
Our algorithm was used
last night to stop
a terrorist attack.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.470
Mmm-hmm.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.445
Nice to know.

23:58.550 --> 24:00.882
Probably saved all
of DC last night.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.605
No big deal.
Right back to work.

24:02.710 --> 24:03.961
Yup.

24:04.070 --> 24:06.061
Not even so much
as a celebratory Cigarette?

24:07.910 --> 24:09.912
You're right.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.492
I can't believe I have
to go to dinner with
my folks tonight

24:13.600 --> 24:17.013
and listen to my father
bitch about how he should
have become a doctor.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.566
Clark Kent will always be
a coward to his friends
and family.

24:21.130 --> 24:22.222
[Sarah] Not true.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.469
Ma and Pa Kent
know he's Superman.

24:24.570 --> 24:26.561
Ah, yeah.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.194
Look, I know you won't get
any credit,

24:32.300 --> 24:35.189
and you won't give
yourself any,

24:35.300 --> 24:37.393
but you did some good, Joe.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.206
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

24:39.310 --> 24:41.301
[Joe] You know, honestly,

24:42.110 --> 24:44.101
until I saw_
the news last night,

24:44.750 --> 24:46.160
I was gonna quit.

24:46.270 --> 24:48.272
-Shut up.
-No, I even told Bob.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.897
You honestly wanna quit
because a terro_rist's civil
liberties are Violated?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.536
Not to mention
the civil liberties

24:55.640 --> 24:58.188
of a whole lot of other people
who it turned out
weren't terrorists.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.020
Yeah, we collected data on
a bunch of innocent people

25:01.130 --> 25:02.904
who are now safer for it.

25:03.010 --> 25:05.501
-How's that bad?
-Okay, but what about
the ones we watched?

25:05.610 --> 25:07.475
Interviewed?

25:07.580 --> 25:09.559
Held for a few hours?

25:09.660 --> 25:11.753
Where's the line?

25:11.860 --> 25:16.229
Eighty thousand people
get infected with the plague
at a football game.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.844
They don't show any signs
of being sick for days.

25:19.950 --> 25:22.009
They go home.

25:22.110 --> 25:23.964
They go to work.

25:24.070 --> 25:26.447
And some get on airplanes,
and they go to other countries.

25:26.550 --> 25:27.938
A couple of minutes ago,
it was just DC.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.655
Now we save the world?

25:29.760 --> 25:31.751
Come on.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.094
What's he doing here?

25:35.200 --> 25:38.021
What? I can't hear you.
It's thick glass.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.963
Probably came to accept
your resignation in person.

25:42.250 --> 25:46.061
Yesterday, countless
American lives were saved

25:46.170 --> 25:48.115
because of this group.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.211
And you deserve
congratulations.

25:51.580 --> 25:53.571
But...

25:54.060 --> 25:56.051
That's not what I'm here for.

25:59.030 --> 26:04.161
Ammar Nazari got a job
at ComQuest Field
with a plan

26:04.270 --> 26:08.991
to infect Americans
with the plague
during a football game.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.635
We know very little else
about him.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.761
Until six weeks ago,
he'd never been on our radar.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.561
We don't know...

26:22.050 --> 26:23.381
Who trained him,

26:23.490 --> 26:25.481
who he’s work/ng for.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.277
The device that was on him,

26:34.380 --> 26:38.020
would have required a great
deal of engineering skill
and manufacturing.

26:39.470 --> 26:43.725
Which means Nazari was
most l/ke/y not work/ng alone.

26:43.830 --> 26:48.051
_Someone out there could
still have weaponized plague,

26:48.160 --> 26:51.232
and we have to assume
they're gomg to use it.

26:53.320 --> 26:59.304
J77'F is working on
the encrypt/ans
on Nazari’s laptop,

26:59.410 --> 27:03.426
combing through his house,
interviewing his neighbors,

27:03.530 --> 27:07.398
trying to trace the materials
on the device

27:07.500 --> 27:09.798
back to a manufacturer.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.313
But it wasn ’t the J77'F
who found this guy.

27:13.420 --> 27:17.402
And I ’m sure as hell not
gonna entrust th/s hunt

27:17.510 --> 27:20.047
to conventional methods alone.

27:20.150 --> 27:23.449
Now, I ’ve rarely
ever given you anything

27:23.550 --> 27:26.792
other an open-ended
mandate to innovate.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.070
But today, I'm asking you...

27:32.160 --> 27:35.049
To put whatever
you're doing on hold,

27:36.850 --> 27:41.219
and make this
your only priority.

27:41.330 --> 27:45.255
If the people Nazari
was working with are gearing
for another attack,

27:46.780 --> 27:50.170
we may only have
a small window
to find and stop them.

28:04.390 --> 28:05.812
[man] You sure this is safe,
Nathan?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.137
A hundred percent.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.218
I got kids.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.299
As one father to another

28:10.400 --> 28:13.335
I guarantee you,
you have nothing
to worry about.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.465
Our man will pick it up
at the embassy tomorrow.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.561
-Okay.
-Safe flight, Ambassador.

28:26.180 --> 28:28.171
So that's it.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.131
Let's do it.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.269
[indistinct chatter]

28:33.380 --> 28:34.927
Bob, about last night...

28:35.030 --> 28:37.021
Let's talk about it later.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.119
[reporter]
Walk us
through a scenario

28:42.230 --> 28:44.255
where a weapon/zed
pneumonic plague

28:44.360 --> 28:48.330
gets that kind of traction
in a major American city.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.250
What kind of plans
does the CDC have /n place?

28:51.360 --> 28:53.908
[analyst]
Well, the plan
is mass prophylaxis.

28:54.010 --> 28:58.344
So, the US has been stock
p/ling cioroﬂoxacm
for decades.

28:58.450 --> 29:01.260
So, in the event
of a health emergency,

29:01.370 --> 29:04.237
P005 or Points
of Dispensing Sites

29:04.340 --> 29:06.479
would be set up
in every major US city.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.696
[speaking in Chinese]

29:12.780 --> 29:14.566
Stock transactions?

29:14.670 --> 29:18.401
Every stock transaction
in the pharmaceutical sector
going back three years.

29:18.510 --> 29:20.728
Uh-huh. Why?

29:20.830 --> 29:23.731
Uh, well, I was thinking
about the country's
vaccine stockpiles.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.774
-Oh.
-Ciprofloxacin.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.290
Bingo.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.936
Girl I used to date
called this morning

29:29.040 --> 29:31.179
to ask if my father
could write_her
a prescription.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.783
You're wondering if someone
made a move into Big Pharma

29:33.890 --> 29:37.189
knowing vaccine stockpiles
would be depleted?

29:37.290 --> 29:39.986
Like the terrorists
shorting airline stocks
before 9/11.

29:40.090 --> 29:41.580
You see, that's a fiction.

29:41.690 --> 29:43.749
Yeah, well, Dick Tracy wore
a two-way wrist radio
in the 405,

29:43.860 --> 29:45.350
and now people
wear Apple watches.

29:45.460 --> 29:46.438
Not cool people.

29:46.540 --> 29:48.314
The point is,
fiction can become real.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.399
-Dick Tracy?
-He was
an underrated detective.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.195
[Jada] So which transactions
stand out?

29:52.300 --> 29:53.961
Uh, well...

29:54.070 --> 29:55.606
I found these 12 companies,

29:55.710 --> 29:58.565
and collectively, they bought
over a billion worth
of Big Pharma.

29:58.670 --> 29:59.921
What connects them?

30:00.030 --> 30:01.725
See, that's just it.
They're all different sizes,

30:01.830 --> 30:03.138
they're headquartered in
different countries.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.935
It all looks completely random,

30:05.040 --> 30:07.736
but that is exactly
how you want it to look
if you're the one doing it.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.775
Okay, so what you're saying
is what you found is
that you found nothing.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.972
Uh, no.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.980
Humans don't do random well.

30:14.090 --> 30:15.739
The minute we try to avoid
creating a pattern,

30:15.850 --> 30:17.420
we just create a different
kind of pattern.

30:17.530 --> 30:19.145
[Tim] So your big idea
is to follow

30:19.250 --> 30:20.979
the money back to the
click turds who
planned this thing.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.092
Dick turds?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.718
Yeah.
It's pretty flimsy there, bud.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.196
Yeah, you're reaching.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.291
I know, I know.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.902
[indistinct chatter]

30:38.710 --> 30:41.008
Now, the FBI is calling this
an act of terron'sm,

30:41.110 --> 30:43.499
but there ’5 been no claim
of responS/b/l/ty

30:43.600 --> 30:46.489
from any known
terror organization.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.989
-Is there any indication
that a--

31:22.880 --> 31:24.290
[Joubert]
Hello.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.539
[Nathan ]
I have a new
ass/gnment for you.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.631
I need it expedited.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.903
The target package
has been sent.

31:32.010 --> 31:34.001
[Joubert]
I'm looking at it now.

31:51.550 --> 31:53.541
[cell phone vibrating]

31:57.230 --> 31:59.221
[rock music playing
on earphones]

32:00.350 --> 32:02.352
[panﬁng]

32:03.560 --> 32:04.458
[grunts]

32:04.560 --> 32:06.096
I'm gonna drop you
on your head.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.191
Come here.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.534
[Mae] So how'd it go
with Kathy H?

32:10.640 --> 32:12.642
Yeah, it was good. Maybe.
I don't know.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.422
Thank you.

32:15.530 --> 32:17.543
You're so good with him.

32:17.650 --> 32:19.720
You'd be such a great dad
if you could ever get
over your bullshit.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.470
My bullshit?

32:22.580 --> 32:23.877
They've heard worse.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.470
Yeah.

32:25.580 --> 32:27.434
You meet someone,

32:27.540 --> 32:29.349
have an actual relationship.

32:29.460 --> 32:32.566
Hard to do if you can't
even tell someone what
you do for a liVing.

32:32.670 --> 32:35.309
Yeah, that's the bullshit
I'm talking about.

32:36.270 --> 32:37.601
Sammy, guys, bedtime.

32:37.710 --> 32:38.608
BOTH: Uh-uh.

32:38.710 --> 32:40.120
Let me just finish this level.

32:40.230 --> 32:41.618
[Mae] What did I say?

32:41.720 --> 32:43.130
She is a tyrant.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.889
Yeah. No kidding.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.991
Come on, Jude.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.585
[Mae] You've been working
for the CIA for a long time
now, Joe.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.624
How is this still
an issue for you?

32:53.730 --> 32:56.267
I guess it's in
my nature to wanna...

32:56.370 --> 32:58.349
Trust a few people.

32:58.450 --> 33:00.475
You think Sam gets to tell me
what he does every day?

33:00.580 --> 33:01.592
No.

33:01.700 --> 33:03.691
But, at least you know
why he can't.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.955
You know what your problem is?

33:07.060 --> 33:08.630
What, I only have one?

33:08.740 --> 33:11.129
-Well, that's up for debate.
-[chuckles]

33:11.230 --> 33:14.324
Unlike every other guy
in the universe,

33:14.430 --> 33:16.967
you think with your heart,
instead of your dick.

33:17.070 --> 33:18.640
Oh.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.071
You can't start
every first date
contemplating marriage.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.431
Get laid. See where it goes.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.531
[indistinct chatter]

33:58.790 --> 33:59.893
[Joubert] Hey, babe,
sorry I'm late.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.651
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
Do I know you?

34:02.760 --> 34:05.137
Look, this creep's
been following me
for six blocks.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.128
Pretend you're
my boyfriend, okay?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.242
Okay.

34:12.530 --> 34:14.521
Is he there?

34:15.090 --> 34:17.081
No.

34:17.690 --> 34:19.476
No, I think you're good.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.571
Thank you.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.891
Anytime.

34:54.690 --> 34:55.941
Thanks for meeting me, Sam.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.518
What the fuck's
going on, Nathan?

34:58.620 --> 35:00.599
I don't like being
exposed like this.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.691
Gareth has been
doing some trades.

35:04.940 --> 35:06.635
What kind of trades?

35:06.740 --> 35:11.120
He bought stock
in pharmaceutical companies

35:11.230 --> 35:13.983
that manufacture ciprofloxacin.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.734
That greedy motherfucker.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.831
[Nathan] It gets worse.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.976
What?

35:25.080 --> 35:29.141
Your friend, Joe Turner.
He found out about them.

35:29.250 --> 35:33.266
And... You don't like
being exposed?

35:33.370 --> 35:36.305
We're exposed.

35:36.410 --> 35:40.710
-So this guy--
-You know, I thought
you were gonna take advantage

35:40.820 --> 35:43.152
of the situation and kiss me.

35:43.260 --> 35:45.979
But you handled yourself
like a perfect gentleman.

35:48.790 --> 35:50.781
Club soda and lime, please.

35:51.870 --> 35:53.861
Can I... Can I buy
you a real drink?

35:54.590 --> 35:56.444
I can't.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.017
Big day at work tomorrow.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.111
I need to keep a clear head.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.137
What are you saying?

36:03.240 --> 36:06.073
I already sent
the assignment
to the assets.

36:12.050 --> 36:14.223
You what?

36:14.330 --> 36:17.788
You're mad because you
have a personal connection,

36:17.900 --> 36:23.213
but once you get past that,
you'll see that this is really
the only way forward.

36:24.420 --> 36:26.411

Water.

36:58.820 --> 37:00.390
[Joe] What's that?

37:00.500 --> 37:02.650
Sorry, I have a nasty habit
of taking my work
home with me.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.861
Isn't that usually a sign
of a fulfilling job?

37:08.390 --> 37:09.721
What can I say?

37:09.830 --> 37:11.821
I love what I do.

37:13.110 --> 37:15.260
How about you?
Are you fulfilled?

37:18.360 --> 37:20.351
I don't know.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.102
Your accent,
where's it from?

37:27.210 --> 37:28.780
Cleveland.

37:28.890 --> 37:31.381
Oh.

37:31.490 --> 37:34.368
If you're not gonna talk
about yourself, why should
I talk about me?

37:36.220 --> 37:37.835
Come on.

37:37.940 --> 37:42.195
We don't know each other.
You don't even know my name.

37:42.300 --> 37:45.576
How often do you get
the chance to be totally
honest with someone?

37:47.750 --> 37:49.741
[Joe] All right.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.696
I have to lie to people
about what I do
for a liVing,

37:56.800 --> 38:00.816
and it makes it hard for me
to get close to anyone.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.911
You carry a lot of guilt.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.391
That's good.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.720
I don't feel guilty
about anything.

38:12.970 --> 38:14.619
It's okay to be happy.

38:14.730 --> 38:16.789
You're young, strong.

38:16.900 --> 38:19.073
You got a long life
ahead of you.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.795
I really like that.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.891
[moaning]

38:35.440 --> 38:37.431
You coming to bed anytime soon?

38:37.920 --> 38:39.057
Ah.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.151
I can't sleep.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.899
[grunting]

38:44.000 --> 38:46.002
You okay?

38:47.370 --> 38:49.019
Sam, hey.

38:49.130 --> 38:50.506
Sam, what's going on?

38:50.610 --> 38:53.022
Nothing, nothing.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.212
[breathing heavily]

38:57.020 --> 38:59.011
I think I'm coming
down with something.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.971
Well, you should
definitely come to bed.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.861
Okay, doc.

39:14.190 --> 39:17.933
We have parent-teacher night
next Thursday for Jude.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.099
I think we should both go
'cause his teacher's a bitch,

39:20.200 --> 39:22.191
and I think I'm gonna lose
my shit if I'm in there
by myself.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.109
Hey.

39:25.210 --> 39:26.620
Are you even listening to me?

39:26.730 --> 39:27.981
Huh?

39:28.090 --> 39:29.944
Did you hear
anything Ijust said?

39:30.050 --> 39:32.746
[exhales deeply] I'm sorry.

39:32.850 --> 39:34.852
I'm sorry, I just...

39:35.500 --> 39:37.491
Got a lot of stuff
on my mind, okay?

39:39.300 --> 39:41.291
Whatever it is,
just let it go.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.182
For once.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.981
Come to bed with me.

39:53.350 --> 39:55.352
[breathing heavily]

39:57.760 --> 39:59.751
I'll _be there in
a minute, okay?

40:04.010 --> 40:06.001
[moaning]

40:13.250 --> 40:15.252
[grunting]

41:04.390 --> 41:06.529
[cell phone ringing]

41:06.630 --> 41:08.200
[Bob
Sam;

41:08.310 --> 41:10.084
[Sam]
Hi Bob.

41:10.190 --> 41:11.999
Are you at home?

41:12.110 --> 41:14.112
[Bob]
.There’s too much
g0/ng on to be at home.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.097
I ’m at lVazari’s.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.919
[Sam]
I ’m gonna head over.
I wanna run something by you.

41:43.990 --> 41:45.981
Hi, Bob.

41:46.830 --> 41:48.821
You seen Nazari's bed?

41:50.190 --> 41:52.181
Yeah.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.252
-Hospital corners.
-Yeah.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.453
What compels a man
about to walk a plague

41:57.560 --> 41:59.835
into a football stadium
to make his bed?

42:01.600 --> 42:03.602
[man speaking
indistinctly over radio]

42:05.850 --> 42:07.841
Well, I guess...

42:09.450 --> 42:14.649
When you're in a combat zone,
those little routines
are a big comfort.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.677
Yeah.

42:17.780 --> 42:20.977
I remember combat zones
being less comfortable.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.781
Not much.

42:29.230 --> 42:31.380
Did I ever tell you
I met your father once?

42:32.640 --> 42:34.631
In Nha Trang.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.591
[chuckles]

42:38.720 --> 42:40.893
I guess you saw a lot of shit.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.844
I mean it's a hell of
a sacrifice to make
for nothing.

42:54.420 --> 42:58.151
We were born after all
the good wars
were already over.

42:58.260 --> 43:00.251
The world has changed.

43:02.670 --> 43:05.002
These people used to
want a seat at the table.

43:05.110 --> 43:07.101
Now they wanna blow
the table up.

43:07.670 --> 43:09.661
How do you...

43:10.910 --> 43:13.549
How do you fight
an enemy like that?

43:22.050 --> 43:24.041
So what did you
wanna talk about?

43:31.060 --> 43:33.073
You're right.

43:33.180 --> 43:35.774
You can't fight an enemy
like that, not like that.

43:42.270 --> 43:44.261
[gunshot]

44:06.370 --> 44:07.780
[machinery whirring]

44:07.890 --> 44:09.881
[indistinct chatter]

44:29.190 --> 44:30.259
Hey.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.816
Power's out on the whole block.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.091
Back-up generator's dead.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.191
Huh.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.577
Dr. Lappe...

44:37.680 --> 44:39.409
Did you read my report
about the pharma stock trades?

44:39.520 --> 44:42.728
Yes, I'm sending it up
to Langley as soon as
the power comes on.

44:50.420 --> 44:52.411
Morning, Colonel.

44:54.340 --> 44:56.274
-Arms up.
-[electric scanning]

44:56.380 --> 44:58.371
[sighs]

44:59.830 --> 45:01.889
I'm gonna miss my flight.

45:01.990 --> 45:03.321
[Colonel] Turner,

45:03.430 --> 45:05.887
I may not have the most
glamorous job in the world,

45:05.990 --> 45:10.131
but believe it or not,
I derive some satisfaction

45:10.240 --> 45:11.411
in doing it well.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.511
What time are you gonna
pick me up for dinner?

45:15.560 --> 45:18.336
My job is to protect everyone
that works in this building.

45:18.440 --> 45:20.624
You going on the fire escape
for your cigarette breaks

45:20.730 --> 45:25.064
is a breach of security
that puts you and everyone
who works here in danger.

45:25.170 --> 45:27.104
I'm giving you
one last warning.

45:27.210 --> 45:29.212
IfI catch you again,
I'm writing you up.

45:30.300 --> 45:32.291
There's one T in Turner.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.451
You're an asshole.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.061
Morning.

45:44.590 --> 45:46.581
Morning.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.271
What's wrong?

45:53.440 --> 45:54.691
[knock at door]

45:54.800 --> 45:56.779
-Hey.
-[Harold] Hi.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.780
Soy vanilla latte, right?

45:58.890 --> 46:00.426
Harold, you didn't
have to do that.

46:00.530 --> 46:03.840
I know, but I wanted to, so...

46:07.290 --> 46:09.429
Also, hey, um,

46:09.540 --> 46:12.191
so I was thinking
maybe, maybe...

46:12.300 --> 46:15.576
Um, you and I could
do something some night.

46:16.540 --> 46:17.393
Or something.

46:17.500 --> 46:20.367
Harold, you seem
like a nice guy.

46:20.470 --> 46:22.358
Well.

46:22.470 --> 46:24.882
But you've been chatting me
up every day since you
started working here,

46:24.990 --> 46:27.925
and I've been very careful
to give you no indication
whatsoever

46:28.030 --> 46:31.215
that I might be at all
interested in seeing you
outside the office,

46:31.320 --> 46:34.869
precisely to avoid you
asking me out and having
to hurt your feelings.

46:36.480 --> 46:38.482
I know.

46:39.290 --> 46:42.748
I just thought, you know,
maybe the drugs that
I put in your coffee might

46:42.850 --> 46:44.260
change your mind.

46:44.370 --> 46:46.361
What?

46:51.260 --> 46:53.251
Bitch.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.211
Sharla called me a hypocrite.

46:58.750 --> 47:01.799
Gave me a guilt trip
about how she'd work too hard

47:01.910 --> 47:05.368
in recovery getting
to know herself to

47:05.470 --> 47:08.871
waste time with someone who
couldn't even_ admit who
they were to their own parents.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.071
[man] Get right in there.

47:29.260 --> 47:31.672
You spent half a decade
behind that desk,

47:31.780 --> 47:33.395
believing that you're
protecting all of us

47:33.500 --> 47:36.071
just in case something
terrible happened.

47:36.180 --> 47:38.580
Your life's purpose was
a pitiful delusion.

47:40.110 --> 47:41.486
[gunshots]

47:41.590 --> 47:43.581
That flew right by my ear.
What the hell?

47:54.800 --> 47:56.449
[woman] Look out!

47:56.560 --> 47:58.562
[screaming]

47:59.610 --> 48:01.601
[grunts]

48:16.380 --> 48:18.382
Go! Get out! Go!

48:21.790 --> 48:23.781
Go, go, go.

48:25.590 --> 48:27.592

48:32.800 --> 48:34.791
G0, 90, 90, 90: 90: 90-

48:36.120 --> 48:38.122
-No, no, no.

48:39.330 --> 48:41.321
Oh, Jesus.

48:46.660 --> 48:48.651

He's in the basement.

50:16.270 --> 50:18.261

50:19.790 --> 50:21.360

50:21.470 --> 50:23.961

Hey, it’s me.
I ’m in Saudi.

50:24.070 --> 50:26.550
