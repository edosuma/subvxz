00:08.409 --> 00:10.781
- I get it first.
- I called it.

00:10.781 --> 00:12.543
HARLEY: In a big family,
 it's a given.

00:12.543 --> 00:13.744
You're gonna
 have to share stuff.

00:13.744 --> 00:16.587
Toys, food,
 pink eye.

00:16.587 --> 00:19.390
Especially
 something awesome.

00:19.390 --> 00:22.923
The other thing about
 a big family--

00:22.923 --> 00:24.925
that "I get it first"
 rule

00:24.925 --> 00:28.399
is less important than
 the "I grabbed it first" rule.

00:30.761 --> 00:32.103
I can't believe it.

00:32.103 --> 00:34.435
Cuff hasn't commented on
any of my posts

00:34.435 --> 00:36.367
in, like, two whole days.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.239
If it wasn't me
he was moving on from,

00:38.239 --> 00:40.010
I'd say he's moving on.

00:40.010 --> 00:41.912
That tablet is so awesome.

00:41.912 --> 00:43.874
That's why we're all
 super careful with it.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.518
Thank you, Marshport.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.088
Right, right,
left, left. Knockout!

00:58.229 --> 01:00.561
Oops.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.563
Harley, your turn.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.596
Finally.

01:05.596 --> 01:07.198
My favorite
live streaming site.

01:07.198 --> 01:10.101
Penguin-cam.
I'm obsessed with penguins.

01:10.101 --> 01:12.803
Maybe because
they're like my family.

01:12.803 --> 01:15.376
They live in large groups,
compete for territory,

01:15.376 --> 01:17.308
and fight over food.

01:17.308 --> 01:19.280
Although I've never
seen a penguin

01:19.280 --> 01:20.781
slap anyone for
the last pork chop.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.284
Anyway, my favorite penguin,
Nim-Nim,

01:23.284 --> 01:25.686
has an egg that's
supposed to hatch any day now.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.359
It's wiggling.
We're getting close.

01:28.359 --> 01:29.860
Ooh alert.

01:31.122 --> 01:32.893
( beeping )

01:32.893 --> 01:35.226
Error? No, tablet,
you cannot die on me now.

01:35.226 --> 01:36.827
( distorted voice )

01:36.827 --> 01:39.470

Mom, Dad, I just
wanna say

02:33.584 --> 02:36.727
that we are really,
really, really

02:36.727 --> 02:38.789
- really--
- We're sorry
we broke the tablet.

02:38.789 --> 02:41.362
Too "really's" max.
We talked about this.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.894
The size of this card
is proportional

02:43.894 --> 02:46.337
to the size
of our regret.

02:46.337 --> 02:48.168
Wow, guys.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.471
We are so touched.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.573
Not "buying you
a new tablet" touched,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.144
but we appreciate
the attempt.

02:54.144 --> 02:56.146
Told you that card
wouldn't work.

02:56.146 --> 02:57.548
Rookies.

02:57.548 --> 03:00.381
Giant card?
Epic fail.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.583
Should've gone
with crying.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.315
Look, I gotta get
down to the marina.

03:04.315 --> 03:07.258
Big weekend at the store.
The remodeled canoes are in.

03:07.258 --> 03:09.260
I seriously don't think
you understand

03:09.260 --> 03:12.793
Without a tablet,
your children are
literally falling apart.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.825
Look.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.799
They do that every day.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.902
Have you not seen
the tongue growth
chart on the wall?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.905
Boys, go to the store
and help your father.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.678
Help? All they do
is make a mess.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.610
Okay, we've drawn
a hard line here.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.582
I can't be home alone
with seven kids

03:31.582 --> 03:33.584
and no tablet.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.118
In a family of nine,
when you need money,

03:38.118 --> 03:39.750
you turn to
the three C's...

03:39.750 --> 03:42.092
car, couch,
and cubbies.

03:44.355 --> 03:46.357
Four cents,

03:46.357 --> 03:48.098
a bloody toe...
wait, what?!

03:48.098 --> 03:51.131
Oh, cocktail weenie
with dried ketchup.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.705
- ( doorbell rings )
- Cool. A toe!

03:54.705 --> 03:56.737
- Uh...
- I'm really sorry
about your tablet.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.038
I'd loan you ours,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.870
but my mom uses it
to track me

03:59.870 --> 04:02.973
in case I get lost...
or come over here.

04:04.174 --> 04:05.516
There you are.

04:05.516 --> 04:07.718
Accurate right down
to a half a block.

04:07.718 --> 04:09.880
Bethany, didn't know
you were here.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.181
Anyway, thanks for coming.

04:11.181 --> 04:12.823
I came to ask
a favor.

04:12.823 --> 04:15.486
Lord know, I'm
certainly owed one.

04:15.486 --> 04:17.488
Could you keep
your brand of

04:17.488 --> 04:21.291
"big family fun: on
your side of the fence
this weekend?

04:21.291 --> 04:23.294
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:24.795 --> 04:26.567
CHILD: Incoming!

04:30.070 --> 04:31.972
Sorry!

04:31.972 --> 04:34.475
HARLEY: Mom really didn't
 have a turkey leg to stand on.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.477
Can we
get that back?

04:36.477 --> 04:39.480
I need quiet.
I have a guest coming.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.813
I rented my spare room through
a bed and breakfast online,

04:42.813 --> 04:44.054
and between
you and me,

04:44.054 --> 04:46.357
she's paying
a lot of money.

04:46.357 --> 04:47.688
A lot.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.160
I mean, I am really
fleecing her.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.993
Don't hatch yet,
baby Nim-Nim.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.795
Auntie Harley's
just figured out

04:54.795 --> 04:56.667
how to get a new tablet.

04:58.028 --> 05:00.671
You wanna rent a room
in our house

05:00.671 --> 05:02.773
to a total stranger
online.

05:02.773 --> 05:05.906
Who hopefully pays
enough to buy a new tablet.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.678
How would that
even work?

05:07.678 --> 05:09.680
We don't have
an extra room.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.413
Our youngest sister
sleeps on a dog bed
in the hall.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.585
We can rent out
our couch.

05:14.585 --> 05:16.847
I checked the website,
it's totally legit.

05:16.847 --> 05:19.350
So is room sharing,
but Georgie snores,

05:19.350 --> 05:21.422
and Beast sleepwalks
and pees in the trash can.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.624
Okay, and on what planet
would Mom and Dad

05:23.624 --> 05:25.896
not notice some random
dude in his PJ's

05:25.896 --> 05:27.928
- drooling on the couch?
- Planet Diaz.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.060
Mom and Dad won't notice
one more kid.

05:30.060 --> 05:33.434
Half the time, they don't
notice the ones they have.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.536
Trust me, I know.

05:37.207 --> 05:38.769
Now that you're in,

05:38.769 --> 05:40.070
I'm going to need you
to design a web page.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.042
I'm not in.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.415
I'm not even in
the neighborhood of in.

05:44.415 --> 05:45.946
But we need the tablet.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.749
Do you want another night
like last night?

05:48.749 --> 05:51.051
There's seven of us
and one remote.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.725
- I'm sure there's
a civilized way--
- Get him!

05:56.000 --> 06:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:04.835 --> 06:07.838
Okay, no fishing for
hot dogs,

06:07.838 --> 06:10.170
no camping in
the tent display,

06:10.170 --> 06:12.443
and no filling up
the canteens with
clam chowder

06:12.443 --> 06:14.605
from the snack bar.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.106
Got it, Dad.

06:18.308 --> 06:20.451
No playing with
the bait.

06:20.451 --> 06:23.183
How'd I forget that?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.955
( frog croaking )

06:24.955 --> 06:27.888
Hey, check out
those frogs.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.491
They're wrestling.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.963
Whoa! Did you see
that pile driver?

06:32.963 --> 06:35.125
He took him down
with his tongue.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.869
I really need
to grow mine out.

06:38.869 --> 06:42.032
Grab that boot.
We've gotta take
these guys to school.

06:42.032 --> 06:44.104
People would pay
to see this.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.608
Maybe we could use the money
to help buy a new tablet.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.109
Or we could buy gum.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.942
Yeah, no one buys us
gum anymore.

06:51.942 --> 06:53.814
You swallow 50 pieces

06:53.814 --> 06:56.447
to see if you can
blow a bubble with your butt

06:56.447 --> 06:58.348
one time.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.761
So I designed the web page
for the couch rental you wanted.

07:10.761 --> 07:14.364
Living room before.
Living room after.

07:14.364 --> 07:17.538
Wow! It looks like a family
who actually cares lives here.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.969
ETHAN: Right?

07:18.969 --> 07:20.310
Check this out.

07:20.310 --> 07:23.273
Bathroom before.
Bathroom after.

07:23.273 --> 07:25.846
That doesn't even
look like our bathroom.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.848
It's actually a picture
from a magazine.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.420
No computer could
make ours so clean.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.723
No wonder we already
have our first booking.

07:32.723 --> 07:34.384
Oh, awesome.

07:34.384 --> 07:35.886
His name is Bai Hsu.

07:35.886 --> 07:38.028
He's a music student
from Asia.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.189
He's coming tomorrow.

07:39.189 --> 07:40.861
( doorbell rings )

07:40.861 --> 07:42.933
Huh.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.495
Who'd come over this late?

07:44.495 --> 07:46.266
Who comes over at all?

07:47.938 --> 07:49.600
What are the odds of
another Asian man

07:49.600 --> 07:51.401
showing up at our door
at 9:00 at night?

07:51.401 --> 07:53.173
With a trombone?
Not good.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.075
He said he was
coming tomorrow.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.177
In Asia, today
is tomorrow!

07:57.177 --> 07:59.009
( doorbell rings )

07:59.009 --> 08:00.781
- SUZY: Door.
- We've got it.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.857
Oh, good, Ethan,
your trombone is here.

08:09.319 --> 08:10.761
Bye.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.464
Trombone? I thought
you were into guitar.

08:14.464 --> 08:16.166
I, um... I had
a sudden urge

08:16.166 --> 08:18.629
to play a way less
cool instrument.

08:30.380 --> 08:33.143
I'm really sorry my sister
slammed the door in your face.

08:33.143 --> 08:36.486
Usually, we are
extremely professional.

08:36.486 --> 08:39.318
In the meantime,
enjoy the on-site gym.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.596
I'm not good in English,

08:45.596 --> 08:47.257
but I know
 this is not a gym.

08:47.257 --> 08:50.060
May I go to bed now?

08:50.060 --> 08:52.803
No one wants that
more than me.

08:54.164 --> 08:55.906
Our guest, Bai Hsu,

08:55.906 --> 08:57.608
will be here for
a two-day music conference.

08:57.608 --> 08:59.339
He'll be leaving
early every morning,

08:59.339 --> 09:00.911
and returning
late at night.

09:00.911 --> 09:02.012
( croaks )

09:02.012 --> 09:03.774
Nights will be easy.

09:03.774 --> 09:06.316
We all know Mom and Dad
have given up by 9:00.

09:06.316 --> 09:07.618
( croaks )

09:07.618 --> 09:10.350
And to make sure they're
extra tired the next day,

09:10.350 --> 09:12.182
Daphne, you tell them
you had a nightmare,

09:12.182 --> 09:14.424
and go sleep in their bed.
Kick all you want.

09:14.424 --> 09:17.557
I was going to kick
no matter what you said.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.730
And just so they don't
get recharged in the morning,

09:19.730 --> 09:22.262
I'm going to mess with
the coffee maker.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.994
With all our breakfast chaos,

09:23.994 --> 09:26.296
Bai will be lost
in the shuffle.

09:26.296 --> 09:29.770
- So Lewie and Beast,
- ( frogs croaking )

09:29.770 --> 09:31.571
you just be Lewie and Beast.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.404
Is this guy famous,
or Rich?

09:34.404 --> 09:36.647
You tell me.
He's staying on our couch.

09:36.647 --> 09:39.650
Okay, the first step
of my master plan

09:39.650 --> 09:41.511
is getting Mom and Dad
to bed.

09:41.511 --> 09:43.954
Guys, I've been thinking,

09:43.954 --> 09:47.387
you work super hard
and never get enough rest.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.159
I made you
some warm milk.

09:52.663 --> 09:55.225
( trombone playing )

09:55.225 --> 09:56.727
What was that?

09:56.727 --> 09:58.869
An owl...

09:58.869 --> 10:00.530
with gas.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.572
Now you should take that
right up to bed.

10:04.534 --> 10:06.837
All clear.
Come on in.

10:10.681 --> 10:12.813
I'm really sorry
about this,

10:12.813 --> 10:15.315
and that weirdly
aggressive possum.

10:17.988 --> 10:19.720
Thank you, kind girl.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.326
He called me kind.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.028
And a girl.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.802
Twenty minutes into
your crazy plan,

10:31.802 --> 10:33.864
and not only do we
almost get caught,

10:33.864 --> 10:36.636
but I sense we're
giving Bai a horrible
impression of America.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.810
It was a bumpy
start, yes,

10:39.810 --> 10:41.842
but he's going to see
we're just a nice,

10:41.842 --> 10:43.473
normal American family.

10:43.473 --> 10:45.776
Look at you,
world traveler,

10:45.776 --> 10:48.949
all alone in
a strange land.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.450
So romantic.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.182
So, tell me,

10:52.182 --> 10:54.324
who's your favorite
field hockey player?

10:54.324 --> 10:57.157
Is that the exchange student?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.891
I was hoping for a blonde,
but I can work with that.

11:00.891 --> 11:03.393
Okay, get in. Closer.

11:03.393 --> 11:04.895
Closer.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.637
Okay, we're done.

11:07.637 --> 11:09.369
What are you doing?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.371
Cuff doesn't wanna
like my photos,

11:11.371 --> 11:13.243
he's really not gonna
like this one.

11:13.243 --> 11:15.075
Tag that foreign
and fierce.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.707
You're foreign,
I'm fierce.

11:16.707 --> 11:19.750
SUZY: Lights out, boys.

11:19.750 --> 11:20.881
Sabers, too.

11:22.713 --> 11:25.255
Quickly, dive and divert.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.258
What's going on down there?

11:28.258 --> 11:30.390
Nothing. Just relaxing
on the couch

11:30.390 --> 11:33.063
like a normal girl who didn't
just meet her soulmate.

11:33.063 --> 11:35.395
( yawns )
Oh good, sounds good.
Don't stay up too late.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.699
I'd like to speak to
 the manager.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.335
All right, guys,
last night was a good warm-up.

11:45.335 --> 11:47.377
Now it's show time.

11:47.377 --> 11:49.409
Operation Confuse and Cover
is a go.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.184
ALL: One, two, three,
tablet!

11:55.685 --> 11:56.887
Don't question it.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.682
Hey, look, the coffee
machine's working.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.922
I had to give her something.

13:16.426 --> 13:20.070
I knew kids at our school
would go nuts for our frogs.

13:20.070 --> 13:21.501
One kid peed himself.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.573
How much do you think
we could get?

13:23.573 --> 13:26.676
I've got 20 packs
of bubble gum on hold.

13:26.676 --> 13:30.180
Beast, this is not
about bubble gum anymore.

13:30.180 --> 13:32.712
This is about our future.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.345
We could be frog
wrestling promoters.

13:35.345 --> 13:37.417
I've always wanted to be that.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.519
But if we wanna
be taken seriously,

13:39.519 --> 13:41.191
we gotta up our game.

13:41.191 --> 13:44.354
We need something
spectacular.

13:44.354 --> 13:47.197
Frog costumes?

13:47.197 --> 13:48.828
Daphne's got doll clothes.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.962
I was going to say get them
to throw a tiny chair,

13:51.962 --> 13:53.733
but that sounds easier.

13:58.568 --> 14:01.571
- Where are her clothes?
- Flushed 'em.

14:03.073 --> 14:06.246
We're going to need someone
who takes care of their things.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.051
I can't give these away
for a doughnut.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.453
Mom took a long time
to sew them.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.925
Plus, I'm not supposed
to have doughnuts,

14:14.925 --> 14:17.487
or anything yummy...
or talk to you.

14:17.487 --> 14:20.090
- I'll throw in
a maple log.
- Here.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.767
One more night.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.140
We're rocking
this bed and breakfast thing.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.102
Can't believe we're
actually gonna pull this off.

14:38.448 --> 14:40.780
Hey, Dad, what are you
doing down here?

14:40.780 --> 14:42.612
I can't get any sleep with
Daphne in the bed

14:42.612 --> 14:44.254
kicking all night.

14:44.254 --> 14:46.616
When's the last time
that girl clipped her toenails?

14:51.922 --> 14:53.964
Man, I must be tired.

14:53.964 --> 14:56.396
I thought I saw an Asian man
standing in our living room.

15:00.770 --> 15:03.203
I've seen your gym already.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.635
I would like to go
 to bed now.

15:05.635 --> 15:07.137
He wants to go
to bed now, Harley.

15:07.137 --> 15:08.838
He wants to go to bed!

15:08.838 --> 15:10.610
I don't need you to
translate the translator.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.042
Come here.

15:13.643 --> 15:15.485
Face it. We gotta
pump the brakes,

15:15.485 --> 15:16.886
and tell Mom and Dad.

15:16.886 --> 15:19.719
What? You can't bail now.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.992
Sorry to interrupt.

15:21.992 --> 15:25.155
Can someone knock
 the giant slug off my back?

15:25.155 --> 15:26.696
If you didn't want in,

15:26.696 --> 15:28.328
you should've said no
at the beginning.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.731
Please help me.
 It is crawling.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.563
I did... repeatedly.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.135
But you don't take no
for an answer.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.237
Not when it's
the wrong answer.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.009
That's what I'm saying.

15:39.009 --> 15:40.640
You don't listen,
and you force people

15:40.640 --> 15:42.412
to do what you want.
Know what they call that?

15:42.412 --> 15:45.315
Focus? Smart, strong?

15:45.315 --> 15:47.477
- Pushy.
- ( gasps )

15:47.477 --> 15:49.349
That's right.
I said it.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.981
I'm out.

15:50.981 --> 15:54.254
Pushy?
Me?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.486
I'm just a person
who knows what she wants,

15:56.486 --> 15:59.489
and makes other people do it
whether they like it or not.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.731
Oh.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.466
There you are.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.340
Now smile like we've been
at an all-night party.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.705
Stop using Bai
for your twisted games.

16:15.705 --> 16:20.480
Innkeeper, I do not intend
 to pay for this stay

16:20.480 --> 16:22.952
if I do not have
 a place to sleep.

16:22.952 --> 16:25.215
I promise you will.

16:25.215 --> 16:27.917
Although I have
no idea where.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.959
It's okay.
Kind girl is here now.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.470
Here we are.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.432
For being
such a loyal customer,

16:42.432 --> 16:45.705
we've upgraded you to
an ocean-view suite.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.537
Yeah, I know.

16:47.537 --> 16:49.709
Ocean view is a bit
of a stretch.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.741
But I figured we wouldn't
get him down here

16:51.741 --> 16:54.484
by calling it "a railing where
seagulls poop" view.

16:54.484 --> 16:57.047
Go check out that raft,

16:57.047 --> 16:59.049
and I'll have that tent
set up in no time.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.704
( frustrated grunt )
Come on!

17:15.704 --> 17:17.207
Oh, hey.

17:19.008 --> 17:21.711
What are you doing here?

17:21.711 --> 17:23.772
I came here to help.

17:23.772 --> 17:26.246
Why? You were right.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.147
I talked you into
a bad plan.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.780
I am pushy.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.123
But you're a good pushy.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.125
Remember how Wayne Heleki
used to push me

17:35.125 --> 17:37.287
into doing crazy stunts
when I was a kid?

17:37.287 --> 17:40.130
Great. Now I'm
a third grader

17:40.130 --> 17:42.492
- who beat the principal up
for lunch money.
- That's the thing.

17:42.492 --> 17:45.695
He used to push people to do
stuff for his own amusement.

17:45.695 --> 17:49.599
But when you force us,
or arm twist, or badger,

17:49.599 --> 17:52.102
- or coerce--
- Good with any one.

17:52.102 --> 17:54.944
You're not doing it
for yourself.

17:54.944 --> 17:56.376
You're doing it
for all of us.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.278
Like that time you made
a zip line

17:58.278 --> 17:59.649
out of old Christmas lights.

17:59.649 --> 18:03.012
Dad said no,
but you did it,

18:03.012 --> 18:04.814
and we had a blast.

18:04.814 --> 18:08.188
But you got 13 stitches
from that broken bulb.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.220
Yeah, and now
I get to tell girls

18:10.220 --> 18:13.393
I survived a shark attack,
so win-win.

18:15.465 --> 18:17.096
You make our family better.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.229
All right.

18:19.229 --> 18:20.770
Comin' in for the hug.

18:23.573 --> 18:24.974
Hang on.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.143
- Brother-sister moment over.
- Totally.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.187
Now let's put
this bad boy up.

18:43.753 --> 18:46.856
You know what?
Let's not wake him.

18:46.856 --> 18:49.359
We'll come by
first thing in the morning.

18:49.359 --> 18:53.062
Good, 'cause I have no idea
how to put a tent up.

18:53.062 --> 18:55.765
( kids cheering )

19:02.342 --> 19:04.774
What did I
tell you, Beast?

19:04.774 --> 19:07.477
Frogs with no capes,
not spectacular.

19:07.477 --> 19:10.820
Frogs with capes,
spectacular.

19:17.187 --> 19:20.330
Can you tell me why
I found my daughter eating this?

19:20.330 --> 19:22.992
Because maple logs
are delicious?

19:22.992 --> 19:25.635
It's a poison stick.
You know where she got it?

19:25.635 --> 19:28.738
Your boys, Monster and Skitch,
or whatever their names are.

19:28.738 --> 19:32.372
You obviously have no idea
what's going on under
your own roof.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.875
I know exactly what's
going on under my own roof.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.208
Awesome news.
Cuff wasn't liking my posts

19:38.208 --> 19:40.950
because he was in
police custody.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.583
He got caught tagging my name
on a porta-potty.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.155
I feel like I'm in
an Ed Sheeran song.

19:48.087 --> 19:51.291
Okay, I didn't know that,
but she was our first child.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.663
It's kinda like when you
make pancakes.

19:53.663 --> 19:55.825
You always have to throw
the first one out.

19:55.825 --> 19:57.497
Well, two of your "pancakes"

19:57.497 --> 19:59.629
woke my bed
and breakfast visitor

19:59.629 --> 20:01.731
with some early morning
sporting event.

20:01.731 --> 20:04.504
Frog wrestling,
round three. Ding.

20:17.587 --> 20:20.119
I don't think that's
frog wrestling.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.921
That's frog love.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.256
Are those my handmade
doll clothes?

20:26.256 --> 20:28.698
Shame on you,
Red Riding Hood.

20:32.101 --> 20:34.804
Let's go.
Come on, wrap it up.

20:34.804 --> 20:36.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:36.566 --> 20:39.238
No one leaves
until I get paid.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.544
Bai's going to be
so surprised.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.875
I got him a present.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.378
A new spit valve
for his trombone.

20:48.378 --> 20:50.920
Wow, you guys are
moving really fast.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.422
So where's that raft
he's sleeping in?

20:52.422 --> 20:54.253
The one that's
not there?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.826
If you're looking for
the Wampanpoac two-seater,

20:56.826 --> 20:59.859
- I sold it.
- BOTH: You sold it?!

20:59.859 --> 21:01.331
Yeah, the guy who bought it
just put it in the water.

21:01.331 --> 21:03.293
( gasps )
Bye-bye, Bai?

21:03.293 --> 21:05.395
Hold on, Bai.
I'm coming.

21:08.698 --> 21:10.970
( splash )

21:12.141 --> 21:15.305
Uh, Dad,
don't freak out,

21:15.305 --> 21:17.477
but there may have been
an Asian trombone player

21:17.477 --> 21:18.648
sleeping in that raft.

21:18.648 --> 21:21.511
- Yeah, I know.
- You do?

21:21.511 --> 21:23.483
Yes, I know all about
Rachel stashing

21:23.483 --> 21:27.086
her exchange student boyfriend
here Foreign and Fierce.

21:27.086 --> 21:31.090
So where's Bai... oyfriend
of Rachel now?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.493
I sent him on his way.
Not a bad kid really.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.994
He offered to pay
for his stay,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.496
but I wouldn't
take his money.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.428
What kind of decent
human being

21:38.428 --> 21:40.029
would charge a person
to sleep in a raft?

21:40.029 --> 21:42.301
No one I know.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.033
Yeah.

21:44.033 --> 21:46.275
Huh.

21:46.275 --> 21:48.508
I guess sometimes being
the overlooked middle kid

21:48.508 --> 21:50.810
means you don't get caught
in the Christmas picture.

21:55.985 --> 21:58.988
But sometimes it means
you just don't get caught.

21:58.988 --> 22:01.951
I forgot I'm not
a very strong swimmer.

22:07.457 --> 22:09.058
Should we tell her?

22:09.058 --> 22:11.931
Eh, let her paddle
around a while.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.634
Sometimes it's more
about the chase.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.866
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:16.866 --> 22:19.539
from the people
who brought you Frog Slam,

22:19.539 --> 22:23.543
comes the next big thing
in amphibian entertainment.

22:23.543 --> 22:27.547
Welcome to
Turtle Takedown.

22:31.020 --> 22:33.082
We've really gotta get
another tablet.

22:33.082 --> 22:35.885
Don't worry. I came up
with a plan.

22:35.885 --> 22:38.888
I wanna say no,
gonna say yes.

22:38.888 --> 22:41.160
Good, 'cause that'll
save us some time.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.592
Move.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.835
Or you're soup.
