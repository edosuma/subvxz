(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

00:12.180 --> 00:13.264
(DOOR OPENING)

00:13.390 --> 00:14.891
Roman emperors
were the real punks.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.685
Don't say "punk."
It's clichÃ©.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.770
Whatever. Let me tell you
about these dinner parties.

00:18.937 --> 00:20.730
Nero loved
a good poisoning.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.524
- At a dinner party?
- He'd arrange one right at the table...

00:22.649 --> 00:23.608
I don't feel like
going on tonight.

00:23.817 --> 00:26.736
Too bad, 'cause that's what
makes the club feel like paying us.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.613
IAN: Titus, this was
all in the book.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.198
Titus would ply
his guests with wine,

00:30.323 --> 00:32.701
then bind their privates
with a chord.

00:32.992 --> 00:35.495
Hey!
Did you get a new guitar?

00:35.954 --> 00:38.957
A '64 teardrop reissue.
Not a mark on it.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.460
All right.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.004
Can I see it?

00:47.590 --> 00:49.092
Oh, it's nice.

00:50.552 --> 00:55.306
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, cut it out, man! Hey!

00:55.432 --> 00:57.684
You stupid son of a...
You're gonna pay!

00:57.809 --> 00:59.602
It's a hunk of wood, bro.

00:59.728 --> 01:01.187
It should look
like a hunk of wood.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.189
We're not the philharmonic.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.567
See, look, man.
It's better already.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.446
(DOOR OPENING)

01:09.571 --> 01:11.114
Hey! It's 10:45.

01:11.364 --> 01:13.533
How about
taking that onstage?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.327
Now I feel
like going on.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.462

02:39.494 --> 02:42.038
<i>You're my child,
and so arethose quadruplets,</i>

02:42.163 --> 02:44.874
<i>and I'm not gonna
give any of you up.</i>

02:44.999 --> 02:47.502
<i>MAN: (ON TV)
Don't you dare talk to meas a mother.</i>

02:47.627 --> 02:50.672
Sign on the door
says "closed for private event."

02:51.256 --> 02:52.632
You're alone.

02:52.757 --> 02:55.343
How much more
private can you get?

02:55.468 --> 02:56.678
Will you pass me a tissue?

02:56.803 --> 02:59.722
Who are you keeping?
You owed me a decision 10 days ago.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.224
Total amnesia.

03:02.559 --> 03:05.937
<i>You're my whole life, you.</i>

03:06.062 --> 03:09.607
And Luisa Maria can't decide
if she's gonna keep the quadruplets.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.442
<i>MAN: (ON TV)
Then how can you...</i>

03:12.694 --> 03:14.696
She keeps them.
I read it online.

03:14.821 --> 03:16.990
You happy now?
I ruined it for you.

03:17.115 --> 03:18.867
- I want two names by Friday.
- Fine.

03:18.992 --> 03:20.702
I'll arrange for a patient
with a mysterious illness

03:20.827 --> 03:21.786
to come in on Thursday.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.663
Yes.
You need more tests.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.206
It's only been two months.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.709
Who knows how they'll react
to freak weather patterns?

03:27.834 --> 03:29.043
They all did fine
in the wind tunnel.

03:29.168 --> 03:33.464
Two names by Friday or the pay overruns
come out of your salary.

03:37.594 --> 03:40.471
<i>I can hurt you.
I know that now.</i>

03:40.597 --> 03:43.349
And I move
your parking space to the E lot.

03:45.018 --> 03:47.353
<i>MAN: (ON TV)
Don't ever leave me, Mom!</i>

03:48.396 --> 03:49.772
Hey.

03:49.898 --> 03:51.649
Who's the sickest patient
you got?

03:51.774 --> 03:55.111
I've got a guy who'll be dead
in the next 10 minutes.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.115
Oh. You mean someone who might actually
survive a diagnosis.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.076
There's nothing here.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.413
Just the usual cracked heads,
gunshots, false alarms.

04:05.538 --> 04:08.708
Who would you pick to fill your
narrow little flats?

04:08.833 --> 04:11.669
So, you can fire them
off my recommendation?

04:12.170 --> 04:13.254
Nice try.

04:13.379 --> 04:17.050
Hey, who do I have to grope to get
some turndown service in here?

04:17.175 --> 04:19.719
Jimmy Quidd.
He's a punk rock singer.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.346
Punk rock star to you.

04:21.471 --> 04:24.015
Repeated trauma,
self-cutting, fever,

04:24.140 --> 04:28.561
arthralgia, hyper-inflated chest,
fatigue, anemia,

04:28.686 --> 04:30.355
blood in the stool
and urine.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.440
I've died and gone
to diagnostic heaven.

04:32.565 --> 04:36.235
His blood results show booze, cocaine,
amphetamines, opiates.

04:36.361 --> 04:39.447
The only mystery here
is how he made it to be 38.

04:39.572 --> 04:40.615
<i>I'm 28.</i>

04:40.740 --> 04:41.991
And he lies.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.620
And he's a pain in the ass.

04:45.745 --> 04:47.163
- Hey, come on.
- No.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.415
Wrap him up.
I'll take him to go.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.087
Dizzying array of symptoms,

04:55.129 --> 04:58.967
any of which could be caused by drugs,
trauma, being a loser.

04:59.092 --> 05:01.469
The guy's a walking pharmacy,
could be anything.

05:01.594 --> 05:04.973
Oh, forgot to mention.
Final case.

05:05.515 --> 05:07.058
Get it right,
you're hired.

05:07.183 --> 05:10.728
Runner-up will be decided strictly
on some definition of merit.

05:10.853 --> 05:11.854
- Endocarditis.
- Hemorrhagic lesions

05:11.980 --> 05:12.939
on the lungs and gut.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.316
Bronchiolitis obliterans,
he smoked his airways into oblivion.

05:15.441 --> 05:16.859
- Endocarditis.
- I already said that.

05:16.985 --> 05:17.986
I heard of it
before you mentioned it.

05:18.111 --> 05:20.113
Speed counts.
Find something else.

05:20.238 --> 05:21.322
Could be
bacterial meningitis.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.074
- You already picked.
- I'll take meningitis.

05:23.199 --> 05:25.743
Too late.
Go run your tests.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.371
No. He's sick
'cause he's a drug addict.

05:28.496 --> 05:32.458
No. He has every symptom
you'd expect from a drug addict.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.460
So, you think
it's all too perfect?

05:34.585 --> 05:36.713
Some other disease
is trying to throw us off its trail?

05:36.838 --> 05:39.090
If he had four out
of 20 possible symptoms,

05:39.215 --> 05:41.217
he'd be
a garden-variety druggie.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.761
Twenty out of 20,
there's an underlying disease.

05:43.886 --> 05:44.721
Run your tests.

05:44.846 --> 05:45.972
FOREMAN: No!

05:46.097 --> 05:49.225
He's weak, in withdrawal,
just spewed blood.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.852
They're gonna rip off
a piece of his lung,

05:50.977 --> 05:51.978
ram instruments
down his throat,

05:52.103 --> 05:53.730
and Rota-Rooter
his intestines.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.023
It'd be nice
if we didn't kill him

05:55.148 --> 05:57.984
trying to figure out
what's killing him.

06:01.446 --> 06:03.906
One diagnosis,
one test at a time.

06:04.032 --> 06:05.533
O2 sats are low,
hyper-inflated chest.

06:05.658 --> 06:06.743
I need a bronchoscopy to...

06:06.868 --> 06:08.828
- You just lost two points.
- What for?

06:08.953 --> 06:10.872
For thinking
it makes a difference who goes first.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.332
- Only one person can be right.
- What points?

06:13.458 --> 06:14.834
Can't have
an objective system

06:14.959 --> 06:16.335
of measurement
without numbers.

06:16.461 --> 06:18.379
You lose three
for not knowing that.

06:18.504 --> 06:24.677
From now on, only the person
holding this can treat or run tests.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.930
Wanted to give you the serpent staff
with the poison axe-head,

06:28.056 --> 06:31.142
but I left it in my car.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.069
Don't need you.

06:41.194 --> 06:42.904
It's one thing to hire based on a game.

06:43.029 --> 06:43.863
Don't need your lecture.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.907
It's insane to treat
based on a game.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.700
You're not
taking the long view.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.286
The one where
we stuff another patient in a body bag?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.497
No, if we're wrong,
that'll come pretty fast.

06:52.622 --> 06:55.124
The long view is the one where
we pick the best team,

06:55.249 --> 06:59.003
that way we can use all the bags
we save for grocery shopping.

07:00.046 --> 07:01.631
You're not buying
that argument, are you?

07:01.756 --> 07:02.757
No.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.258
In which case,
I'm back to my original position.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.760
Don't need you.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.603
What do you think
of Amber?

07:16.145 --> 07:18.564
I screwed up a diagnosis.

07:22.944 --> 07:25.113
You don't seem
that upset by it.

07:26.739 --> 07:31.077
I diagnosed a guy with adenocarcinoma
three months ago.

07:31.202 --> 07:32.787
Told him
he had six months.

07:32.912 --> 07:35.957
So, now you gotta tell him that he's way
behind on his Christmas shopping?

07:36.082 --> 07:38.918
He didn't get worse.
I rechecked everything.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.754
Biopsy was
a false positive.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.590
Harmless lesions
caused by talc inhalation.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.801
Medical clemency.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.136
Interesting.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.221
Why would
you use that word?

07:50.346 --> 07:52.181
Because I'm interested.

07:52.557 --> 07:53.975
When I'm interested,
I describe the things

07:54.100 --> 07:56.018
that make me interested
as interesting.

07:56.144 --> 07:58.980
Most people would say
good, possibly great.

07:59.105 --> 08:00.314
Why aren't you
able to just enjoy...

08:00.565 --> 08:04.110
Why aren't other people
able to just be interested?

08:10.324 --> 08:12.743
- Is he in there?
- Yeah.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.787
Why'd you go right
for the drug theories?

08:15.037 --> 08:17.832
If he had a history
of shoving cancer into his veins,

08:17.957 --> 08:19.834
I'd have guessed cancer.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.253
Okay. You're an idiot.

08:23.004 --> 08:25.590
Either that or you've decided
you can trust a smoking addict

08:25.715 --> 08:27.758
alone in a bathroom
with an oxygen tank.

08:27.884 --> 08:29.051
(EXPLOSION)

08:29.177 --> 08:30.553
(CLANGING)

08:32.096 --> 08:34.682
(GROANING)

08:35.600 --> 08:37.810
I got your
new test results back.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.022
Sorry I'm late.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.233
Who's your colleague?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.401
Dr. House.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.986
Yes, Dr. Wilson.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.947
I really don't
need the consult.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.574
I know the prognosis.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.075
Apparently not.

08:54.202 --> 08:58.623
Mr. McKenna,
I can't believe I'm able to say this,

08:59.999 --> 09:01.876
but you're cancer-free.

09:02.001 --> 09:05.046
The biopsy looked
like adenocarcinoma, but it wasn't.

09:05.171 --> 09:07.965
Harmless lesions
on your lungs. You're fine.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.097
I don't get it.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.935
- Cool.
- No, it's...

09:19.060 --> 09:20.853
I know this must
come as a shock,

09:20.978 --> 09:23.898
but I've
double-checked the labs.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.901
I just accepted
an offer on my house.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.445
I've had three
goodbye parties.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.073
I'm buying
plane tickets to Venice.

09:32.198 --> 09:34.617
You can still use those
if you're alive.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.955
I have to pay a $6,000 broker commission
on a house I'm not selling.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.166
Money I don't have.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.132
Thank you
for letting me know.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.932
(STUTTERING)

09:58.057 --> 10:02.061
I would have thought the living
would mean more than the expenses.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.188
It's not about
the money.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.115
I have 17 points?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.992
I started
you all out on 100.

10:16.117 --> 10:17.535
Then you blew up
part of the building.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.995
Where's Foreman?

10:19.120 --> 10:19.996
He 9011 paged.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.956
- By who? Is it about our...
- Me.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.542
I needed him right away,
somewhere else.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.085
We're hiding
from Foreman?

10:26.294 --> 10:29.880
Foreman accused me
of playing games with patient care.

10:30.006 --> 10:30.923
Who gets
the eyeball next?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.717
I haven't run my test yet.
It still might be a lung issue.

10:32.842 --> 10:35.469
You can't run your test. The patient
had massive smoke inhalation.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.638
Do a bronchoscopy,
it'll set off a laryngospasm.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.015
I'll do
an open-lung biopsy instead.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.017
You want an invasive surgery
because you screwed up?

10:41.142 --> 10:42.810
The patient
snuck a cigarette.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.479
The patient is an addict.
It's not his fault he's jonesing

10:45.604 --> 10:46.939
for whatever
he can get his hands on.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.983
Not his fault
he's jonesing?

10:49.108 --> 10:51.319
In what universe does
that make any sense?

10:51.444 --> 10:53.446
Get him
on a nicotine patch.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.823
That'll keep up
with his joneses.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.283
Do your biopsy.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.085
How's the new us's
final case going?

11:08.210 --> 11:12.006
It's a moving target. House keeps moving
it, so I can't find it.

11:12.757 --> 11:17.428
So, you decided to focus on solving
the problem in Darfur?

11:18.179 --> 11:20.514
Taub is in there
prepping the patient for a biopsy.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.392
Stay close to Taub,
I stay close to House.

11:23.768 --> 11:26.187
And stay close to the game.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.022
I'm trying to
stop the game.

11:28.147 --> 11:30.149
That's your role
in the game.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.485
Did you wander
over here to annoy me?

11:32.610 --> 11:34.487
You're not
wearing a lab coat.

11:34.612 --> 11:36.280
House doesn't
wear one, does he?

11:36.405 --> 11:37.531
Damn!

11:37.656 --> 11:39.075
Now when I walk away,
it's gonna look like

11:39.200 --> 11:41.369
I have a reason other
than just annoyance.

11:42.036 --> 11:44.121
(GRUNTING)

11:44.997 --> 11:47.541
He won't let us
finish prepping him for the biopsy.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.001
Try the other arm.

11:49.126 --> 11:52.380
The problem's not the arm,
it's the entire patient.

12:02.681 --> 12:03.808
Hi.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.227
He let you check his chest.

12:06.352 --> 12:09.021
He let you do anything
except check that arm.

12:10.272 --> 12:13.025
He wallpapered himself
with nicotine patches.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.198
Real rebellion has a point,

12:19.323 --> 12:21.992
it's not just
juvenile and purposeless.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.996
Maybe purposelessness
is my purpose.

12:26.372 --> 12:27.748
Mission accomplished.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.543
Amber, it's not
the patches.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.670
He's got blood clots
moving through his body.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.464
Means I was wrong.

12:38.092 --> 12:39.135
Oh!

12:42.263 --> 12:46.100
If the clot reaches his lungs
or his heart, it'll kill him.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.563
It's true!

12:50.688 --> 12:52.022
We all know it's true.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.107
You just
wasted our time.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.483
And what you're doing?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.651
I'm not competing.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.903
- Where's Taub?
- Foreman was following him.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.113
So, you paged Taub.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.240
Didn't see that
I had much choice.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.076
He has schistocytes
on his blood smear

13:04.201 --> 13:06.036
which means DIC's
causing the clotting.

13:06.162 --> 13:07.288
What's causing the DIC?

13:07.413 --> 13:09.290
- Drug impurities.
- You lost your round.

13:09.415 --> 13:11.333
New symptom, new round.
This has to be drug related.

13:11.459 --> 13:13.711
This is how doctors kill patients,
by seeing the stereotypes...

13:13.836 --> 13:16.088
Drug addicts use drugs
is a stereotype?

13:16.213 --> 13:18.090
Drugs are bad
is a stereotype?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.134
- Losers lose is...
- Malaria.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.677
He hasn't left
the country in years.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.345
THIRTEEN: Malaria's
relapsing-recurring.

13:23.471 --> 13:25.222
For all we know,
he could have been sick for years.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.642
It explains not just the DIC and
the bleeding, but the tiredness, fever,

13:28.767 --> 13:30.186
everything
we attributed to drugs.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.563
Oh, yeah. It's much more likely
that this ass punk rocker

13:32.688 --> 13:35.733
was exposed to
malaria than drugs?

13:35.858 --> 13:38.152
If you were always right,
then you wouldn't have just been wrong.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.446
Or let the patient
mainline nicotine.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.323
Or ravaged
my anatomical model,

13:42.448 --> 13:44.867
which Grandma House bought me
when I aced my MCATs.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.578
A pharmaceutical rep
left that here on Tuesday.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.079
Grandma does
some part-time work.

13:49.205 --> 13:51.290
The rep was
a 30-something babe.

13:51.457 --> 13:53.334
Thank you. I got her hips.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.002
Carry it with pride.

13:55.127 --> 13:58.714
Manipulative bitch,
you're wanted in the laser's circle.

14:04.053 --> 14:06.305
Why do you hate drug addicts?

14:07.056 --> 14:08.224
Your situation
is different.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.476
You're taking
a necessary prescription...

14:10.601 --> 14:13.604
I know. I'm fabulous.
And I'm not the patient.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.439
I'm not allowed to have
a problem with junkies?

14:15.564 --> 14:18.234
You're allowed.
There's gotta be a reason.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.238
He's the patient. You don't know him.
Why do you hate him?

14:22.363 --> 14:23.656
He's throwing his life away.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.158
'Cause he's
setting his own terms,

14:26.283 --> 14:29.119
not living in fear
of every pop quiz?

14:29.245 --> 14:31.539
I thought we were
talking about him.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.084
We were never
talking about him.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.629
Why are you afraid to lose?

14:39.922 --> 14:42.258
Are you gonna fire me
because I like to win?

14:42.424 --> 14:44.510
Just wanna know
the reason.

14:46.387 --> 14:51.392
I watched this football game once,
and I noticed something odd.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.144
The winning team
was the happy one.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.064
I did the math.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.857
Our patient's happy.

14:58.983 --> 14:59.858
He's an idiot.

15:00.109 --> 15:01.819
He's a happy idiot.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.863
That screws
with your worldview.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.282
(INHALES HEAVILY)

15:06.407 --> 15:09.910
There's something freeing
about being a loser, isn't there?

15:10.035 --> 15:10.869
Why are you afraid to...

15:10.995 --> 15:14.623
Mommy didn't love me enough.
Daddy expected too much from me.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.334
Something.

15:19.503 --> 15:23.382
Let's assume that's true. I get how
that can make me a screwed up person.

15:23.507 --> 15:27.469
But how is my willingness
to do anything to get the right answer

15:27.595 --> 15:29.263
bad for my patients?

15:32.600 --> 15:37.062
Or put in terms you can understand,
how is it bad for you?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.405
THIRTEEN: I didn't ask you
to pick up the meds.

15:46.530 --> 15:47.615
I'm trying to be
a good colleague.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.033
You're trying
to boost your score

15:49.158 --> 15:50.326
by prescribing
drugs for House.

15:50.451 --> 15:51.744
Why else
would you have a second bag?

15:51.869 --> 15:53.203
Didn't say good
colleague to you.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.496
You realize
we still have a patient.

15:54.622 --> 15:55.831
Don't care
about the patient.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.833
You care about this job more
than you care about his life?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.710
I care about my wallpaper more
than I care about his life.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.045
Okay. You're
jerking me around.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.504
There's no reason
to be a doctor if you don't care.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.548
I care about life.
I just don't care about his.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.009
He doesn't care, why should I?
My time is better spent...

16:07.134 --> 16:09.053
Kissing up to your boss?

16:09.678 --> 16:12.222
Average doctor cuts off a patient
18 seconds into a history,

16:12.348 --> 16:14.350
because that's all
the time he's got.

16:14.475 --> 16:16.852
Meanwhile, six of us are administering
to a guy with a death wish.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.145
So, why do you
want the job?

16:18.270 --> 16:21.440
Not because I'm maximizing
my service to mankind.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.108
Good for you.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.907
Where is he?

16:31.116 --> 16:32.117
We're gonna spend
the next hour

16:45.381 --> 16:48.258
A profit-seeking
entity released this?

16:48.384 --> 16:50.344
He put it out himself.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.221
He wanted people to
listen, but apparently

16:52.346 --> 16:55.057
didn't want people
to enjoy listening.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.809
- Now, why would someone...
- Truly a mystery.

16:56.934 --> 17:00.187
Why would anyone do something
just to aggravate people?

17:03.232 --> 17:07.194
Why would you have
a blank liability release form

17:07.319 --> 17:10.197
plus your checkbook
on top of your desk?

17:10.781 --> 17:13.867
Probably because
they were in the second drawer,

17:13.992 --> 17:15.619
in a manila envelope,
under a book,

17:15.744 --> 17:17.413
and you put them
on top of my desk.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.331
You usually keep
your checkbook at home.

17:19.456 --> 17:22.710
It's your go-to excuse
for why you can't lend me money.

17:24.086 --> 17:27.005
You're gonna pay
the guy the six grand, aren't you?

17:33.512 --> 17:35.556
I handed the guy
a death sentence.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.391
He's not distressed
with the death sentence.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.351
He's distressed
with the life sentence.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.603
I gave him
three months of misery.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.606
You gave him three months
of being someone special.

17:44.732 --> 17:47.234
You're paying the guy
because he used to be boring,

17:47.359 --> 17:49.153
and without you,
he's gonna be boring again.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.160
Well, no.

17:56.285 --> 18:00.539
But we were wondering if you'd sent
the patient for any additional tests?

18:05.085 --> 18:06.837
You lost the patient.

18:08.672 --> 18:12.885
Taub, you check lost and found.
Thirteen, come with me.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.639
Why do you love
drug addicts?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.809
I won't pigeonhole the patient,
so that means I'm...

18:20.934 --> 18:23.604
Perfectly capable
of drawing my own conclusions.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.272
Are you capable of
answering a question?

18:25.397 --> 18:27.065
I think there's more
to him than the drugs.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.192
Admirable, why?

18:28.317 --> 18:29.902
I need a reason
for doing something admirable?

18:30.027 --> 18:31.111

are a mask for something else?

18:41.789 --> 18:44.500
Drugs are always
a mask for something else.

I've heard in my life.

want this job?

Good news for you,
Thirteen.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.003
'Cause that is
definitely not drugs.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.967
HOUSE: The blood clots
were drug related.

23:04.092 --> 23:08.055
Coughing up blood and the respiratory
arrests are still on the table.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.139
Inhalants?

23:09.264 --> 23:11.141
If I wanted or needed
your drug diagnosis,

23:11.266 --> 23:12.851
I would have told
Foreman where we are.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.770
He knows
where we are.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.607
'Cause he followed you!

23:18.815 --> 23:20.400
- I followed Taub.
- I followed her.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.736
He had a bleeding problem.
That could cause respiratory arrest.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.739
Again, if I wanted to forgive
his Drano drinking ways,

23:26.281 --> 23:27.783
I wouldn't ignore
what you just said.

23:27.908 --> 23:28.742
TAUB: Could be an infection.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.870
- No, lumbar puncture's clear.
- What lumbar puncture?

23:31.995 --> 23:33.371
You didn't authorize
that test.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.540
True, and yet here
I am with the results.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.334
Thirteen thought it was
bacterial meningitis.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.044
And I had the eyeball.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.378
It was a harmless test.

23:40.504 --> 23:42.547
Patient's welfare still counts
for something, doesn't it?

23:42.672 --> 23:43.840
Yep. Minus 50.

23:43.965 --> 23:47.177
KUTNER: Chronic pulmonary embolisms
would explain the breathing problem

23:47.302 --> 23:49.846
and the blood
coming from his lungs.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.768
- I'll run an ultrasound...
- You're not running any tests.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.020
He knows it's not PEs,
the guy's d-dimer's normal.

23:57.229 --> 23:58.063
That doesn't
always rule out...

23:58.188 --> 24:00.357
You go in to run one test,
run eight more like she did,

24:00.482 --> 24:04.069
find out which one's right,
then comes back with a brilliant guess.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.821
- Is this true?
- No.

24:05.946 --> 24:09.157
That's too bad, 'cause that would have
earned you 40 points for cleverness.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.576
Points go to Amber.
Foreman, you run the test.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.454
Sure, anything I can do
to help your game.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.501
- He's not gonna run the tests.
- No. I don't think so.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.049
So, what's wrong with me?

24:26.675 --> 24:28.927
You mean,
besides your music?

24:29.553 --> 24:31.847
Oh, sure. Just because I don't play
your kind of music,

24:31.972 --> 24:33.598
it's not music, right?

24:33.723 --> 24:36.518
Yeah, I resent you
'cause you're not Perry Como.

24:38.854 --> 24:43.483
Look I don't play
for an audience, okay?

24:43.900 --> 24:46.778
Well, then, that stage
you stand on is an odd choice.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.573
I just... I do it for me, okay?
I don't do it for you.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.658
There are three choices
in this life.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.743
Be good, get good
or give up.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.705
You've gone
for column D. Why?

25:00.417 --> 25:03.712
Simple answer is if you don't try,
you can't fail.

25:07.048 --> 25:09.217
Are you really that simple?

25:09.593 --> 25:13.722
Look, yeah, some people,
they like my music.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.640
Most people can't stand it.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.604
But they just sort of
just shrug and ignore me.

25:20.729 --> 25:24.691
But a few, they feel
like they have to tell me

25:27.194 --> 25:30.363
what I'm screwing up,
you know, what I'm wasting.

25:33.617 --> 25:35.202
Why do they care?

25:37.787 --> 25:41.082
You have some peculiar masses
near your heart.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.542
Peculiar, how?

25:42.667 --> 25:45.629
Well, unlike your music, they elicit
some emotional response.

25:45.754 --> 25:46.922
(CHUCKLING)

25:48.632 --> 25:49.883
That's odd.

25:51.092 --> 25:52.510
You care
if I appreciate your music,

25:52.636 --> 25:55.096
but you don't care
if you live or die.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.101
Maybe the answer
is that simple.

26:02.229 --> 26:05.982
I can't apologize
enough, to you, to your family.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.987
There may not be any technical
liability here but...

26:15.200 --> 26:16.952
You're ripping it up
because you think

26:17.077 --> 26:19.746
it would be wrong
to take money from me?

26:20.538 --> 26:24.042
I think it would be wrong
to take so little money from you.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.503
You're out $6,000...

26:26.628 --> 26:28.004
You ruined my life.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.881
I ruined three months.

26:30.006 --> 26:34.010
For the first time in my life,
I was living in the present,

26:34.135 --> 26:35.220
'cause that's all there was.

26:36.763 --> 26:41.726
You're suing me, not for the wrong
diagnosis, but for the right one?

26:44.312 --> 26:46.731
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

26:46.856 --> 26:49.943
You gave me happiness,

26:52.237 --> 26:54.239
and then you took it away.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.538
Definitely no emboli.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.580
It's pretty fuzzy.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.250
Hey, for point and shoot,
I thought I did okay.

27:05.375 --> 27:06.584
TAUB: It's fuzzy
'cause he was still shaking,

27:06.710 --> 27:09.254
'cause he was coming down
from the heroin.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.422
Where is everybody else?

27:10.547 --> 27:12.424
Clinic's been quarantined.

27:12.549 --> 27:15.051
Patient came in with
avian flu-like symptoms,

27:15.176 --> 27:17.262
and 50 extra dollars
in spending money.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.055
Can you do this echo again?

27:19.180 --> 27:21.975
Okay, minus five
for ingratitude.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.476
No "Thank you, Dr. House."

27:23.601 --> 27:25.103
No "Here's a bottle of Codeine

27:25.228 --> 27:26.646
"for your troubles,
Dr. House." Oh, no.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.315
I was asking
if you could do it again

27:28.440 --> 27:30.817
after giving him
a sedative to keep him still.

27:30.942 --> 27:33.361
I could. We'd definitely
get the answer,

27:33.486 --> 27:35.613
but since the opiates would decrease
his respiratory drive,

27:35.739 --> 27:37.824
and he already
can barely breathe,

27:37.949 --> 27:40.118
minus 10 for asking me
to kill the patient.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.454
TAUB: What if it's
a congenital defect,

27:42.579 --> 27:44.456
an anomalous
vessel on his heart?

27:44.581 --> 27:46.833
You know that the heart
does the blood stuff, right?

27:46.958 --> 27:48.668
And the lungs
do the breathing?

27:48.793 --> 27:51.546
If the vessel wrapped
around his trachea.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.469
What do you want me to do?

27:57.594 --> 27:58.636
MRA.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.723
So you can get a clear picture
of that vessel.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.976
What? Wait, what?
What? Why?

28:05.852 --> 28:08.480
You said the picture sucked
because the patient was shaking.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.689
MRA will be worse.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.733
We have to
get a picture.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.363
You were doing better
before you had a good idea.

28:16.488 --> 28:19.324
How can we see it
if we don't take a picture?

28:20.784 --> 28:22.619
You can see me, right?

28:23.119 --> 28:26.039
We wanna look at his heart
with our eyes.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.293
So, I kill the patient
on my operating table,

28:30.418 --> 28:32.087
you get to keep
testing your team,

28:32.212 --> 28:34.381
and I take the heat
from Cuddy.

28:34.506 --> 28:36.257
If it goes that way, yeah,
that'd be excellent.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.093
TAUB: His respiratory status
is through the floor.

28:38.218 --> 28:40.387
If there's a vessel
and we don't remove it fast,

28:40.512 --> 28:42.722
best case,
he's on a ventilator for life.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.849
Granted,
it'll be a short one.

28:45.392 --> 28:47.644
Who do you think
I should hire?

28:48.186 --> 28:50.772
You want me to tell you
in front of him?

28:50.897 --> 28:53.691
Well, it'd be rude
to ask him to leave now.

28:54.109 --> 28:57.445
If you don't do the surgery,
the patient will die.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.322
You'll have had
nothing to do with it,

28:59.447 --> 29:01.408
and everyone will know
that you had nothing to do with it.

29:01.533 --> 29:03.243
And everyone will know
that it's because

29:03.368 --> 29:05.203
you were pissed off
at House for firing you.

29:05.328 --> 29:06.996
You know that's not
why I'm saying no.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.958
Yeah, but that's how
it's gonna play out.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.545
Keep him and Amber.
You'll get stuff done.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.965
Prep him for surgery.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.929
CHASE: This isn't
an anomalous vessel.

29:23.596 --> 29:26.141
Look at these lymph nodes.
Way too big.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.893
They're the masses you saw.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.770
70 over 40. He's crashing.

29:30.895 --> 29:32.063
Two units of PRBCs.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.732
Starting dopamine.
We're losing him!

29:35.567 --> 29:37.652
So, how's your
game going?

29:38.778 --> 29:40.905
It's not whether
you win or lose.

29:46.202 --> 29:49.414
Respiratory failure
and large lymph nodes.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.792
Whatever this is, he's not gonna be
breathing much longer.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.502
Does Foreman being here
means the game's over?

29:54.627 --> 29:56.546
It means the patient's life
is almost over.

29:56.671 --> 29:58.882
You can call it
what you want.

30:01.092 --> 30:03.219
We're done, people.
Come on!

30:03.595 --> 30:05.889
I need ideas. I don't care
who they come from.

30:06.014 --> 30:07.515
Of course you do.
This is still a game.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.518
You're still gonna reward whoever gets
the right idea, punish whoever's wrong.

30:10.643 --> 30:13.313
Hire who you want.
Get this over with.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.985
Thirteen, Kutner.

30:21.321 --> 30:23.281
I'm sorry. Go home.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.869
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

30:27.994 --> 30:28.828
He just told me
that I gotta...

30:28.953 --> 30:30.246
Lungs are stiff,
could be ARDS.

30:30.580 --> 30:31.748
You fluid overloaded him.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.083
Anyone's lungs would leak
after that surgery.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.752
- Goodbye.
- Anaphylactic shock.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.003
No sign of bronchospasm.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.129
What if the lymph nodes
are caused by

30:38.254 --> 30:39.881
chronic stimulation
of his immune system?

30:40.006 --> 30:41.049
Impurities in his drugs
could've...

30:41.174 --> 30:42.717
Street drugs are laced
with all kinds of things.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.261
An immune overreaction
would explain everything.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.055
Drug diagnosis.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.390
That's what
you're going with?

30:56.439 --> 30:59.526
That firing thing,
it was all a dream.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.613
Go find where he gets his drugs
and what's in them.

31:03.738 --> 31:07.116
And put him on dimercaprol
for heavy metal poisoning.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.289
Competition works.

31:19.921 --> 31:23.091
AMBER: So, you're not
gonna tell me who sells you drugs?

31:25.885 --> 31:27.428
What does it matter?

31:27.554 --> 31:29.514
You're dying.
Does that matter?

31:31.266 --> 31:32.725
Not really.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.399
I'm not an adult.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.778
Never wanted to be.

31:46.447 --> 31:48.157
So, if the choice

31:49.659 --> 31:52.328
is running out
the clock with a walker,

31:54.289 --> 31:55.957
and a bedpan...

32:04.090 --> 32:06.175
You don't regret anything?

32:07.510 --> 32:09.512
Well, there was
a lot of drugs,

32:12.432 --> 32:15.602
a lot of drinking,
a lot of fights.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.362
I regret everything else.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.536
You hate me, don't you?

32:36.372 --> 32:37.540
Yeah.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.336
I don't care.

32:46.716 --> 32:48.384
What's it like?

32:52.680 --> 32:54.891
It means
you have no regrets.

sticks in your head, doesn't it?

This guy's amazing.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.415
There's not one
redeeming note.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.542
What sort of a lawyer
tells his client

33:21.668 --> 33:23.920
he's got a case because
he's going to live?

33:24.170 --> 33:26.214
I've heard
that not all lawyers

33:26.339 --> 33:28.257
are as ethical as
the ones we see on TV.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.385
I don't think this guy
even has a law degree.

33:30.510 --> 33:32.220
Well, the guys on TV
don't, either.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.681
I think he has
a medical degree.

33:46.484 --> 33:49.112
It directly affects
my bottom line.

33:49.237 --> 33:50.196
If you have less
money to lend...

33:50.321 --> 33:52.657
I'm trying to take
responsibility.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.951
And I'm trying to teach you
that everyone is out for theirs.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.452
You might as well
keep yours.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.204
And lend it to you?

33:58.413 --> 34:00.707
You have to
control everything.

34:00.832 --> 34:03.376
How come you're going around asking
everyone who you should fire?

34:03.501 --> 34:05.420
I'm asking for input!

34:05.545 --> 34:07.338
I thought you would have
admired the humility.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.674
You like games because
you can control them.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.008
God, I'm gonna put
the record back on.

You like what's interesting,
never mind if it's real or good.

You wanna know
why you offered that guy six grand?

Life just happens,
and that scares the hell out of you.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.226
You think you can cure pain.

34:20.351 --> 34:21.477
You think
you can avoid pain.

34:21.602 --> 34:23.438
You think you're responsible
for every failure,

34:23.563 --> 34:26.899
every patient's boring life,
every friend's screwed-up...

34:27.108 --> 34:29.569
You don't wanna
face it any more than my patient does.

at a home for abandoned kids.

34:50.506 --> 34:51.466
Why are you
telling me this?

34:51.591 --> 34:52.925
Because his
bass player told me.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.260
Is it medically relevant?

34:54.385 --> 34:55.386
I don't know.

34:55.511 --> 34:59.182
Well, then, why are you...
Stop playing games and do your job.

35:06.439 --> 35:07.356
No.

35:14.238 --> 35:17.909
This time I'm firing
Taub and Amber.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.288
This is a joke, right?

35:22.413 --> 35:24.665
It's only a joke if you come up
with the answer.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.376
It's not really funny
if you don't.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.881
Thirteen and Kutner,
you're fired, too.

35:33.508 --> 35:35.134
- Foreman?
- He's a druggie.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.512
I was never sure
there was a disease in the first place.

35:37.637 --> 35:40.515
So, all we know
is that he's dying.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.518
Who wants to
tell the patient?

35:44.685 --> 35:47.396
Fine, I'll get some kid
to go talk to him.

35:47.522 --> 35:50.525
It's the only people
he gets along with anyway.

35:51.067 --> 35:52.693
Are we still fired?

35:57.031 --> 35:58.533
He works
with abandoned kids.

35:58.658 --> 36:00.660
Is it medically relevant?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.411
I think so.

36:03.663 --> 36:04.705
(DOOR OPENING)

36:05.581 --> 36:07.416
I need a brain biopsy.

36:07.917 --> 36:09.377
For the patient.

36:09.502 --> 36:10.878
(EXCLAIMS)

36:11.420 --> 36:12.630
You two switch.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.674
You wanna drill into
the skull of a patient

36:14.799 --> 36:17.885
who almost died
on the operating table yesterday?

36:21.931 --> 36:22.765
Why are they here?

36:23.349 --> 36:26.811
Because I wouldn't have gotten
the answer without each of them.

36:26.936 --> 36:28.855
You could have just told me.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.398
I want you to feel guilty.

36:30.523 --> 36:32.358
She thinks
the patient's a loser.

36:32.483 --> 36:34.193
She thinks
the patient's a winner,

36:34.318 --> 36:37.029
just a regular guy
with a regular problem.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.615
He thinks he's gonna be great
once he's all grown up,

36:39.740 --> 36:43.077
and he thinks...
What did you think?

36:43.202 --> 36:44.662
- Autoimmune.
- Right.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.706
Less interesting
but just as important.

36:46.831 --> 36:49.584
- We can't all be right.
- You're all wrong.

36:49.709 --> 36:52.128
My mom always said that two wrongs
don't make a right.

36:52.336 --> 36:54.797
She never said anything
about four wrongs.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.883
I always
found that suspicious.

36:57.008 --> 36:59.302
Plain old measles,
constant exposure from

36:59.427 --> 37:01.304
hanging out with
Oliver Twist and his lot.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.389
I assume
he's been vaccinated.

37:03.514 --> 37:06.434
Patient's immune system
was shredded with years of drugs.

37:06.559 --> 37:08.603
Early markers
of rash and fever

37:08.728 --> 37:10.187
would have been lost
on a druggie.

37:10.396 --> 37:11.439
His immune system
overreacted,

37:11.564 --> 37:14.066
which is why
his body went haywire.

37:14.734 --> 37:16.402
That's clever.

37:18.696 --> 37:21.532
You're not doing a biopsy
without neurological symptoms.

37:21.699 --> 37:24.243
If I'm right,
the virus is in his brain.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.579
Wrong course of treatment
could be his last course.

37:26.704 --> 37:28.915
I need a neurological...

37:29.040 --> 37:30.291
He kept swallowing.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.793
Could be neurological,
could be a complex partial seizure.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.712
What did it look like?

37:37.465 --> 37:40.885
Good God, woman,
how much more proof do you need?

37:41.761 --> 37:45.264
If you can induce a seizure,
you can have your biopsy.

37:46.766 --> 37:48.184
<i>Hoes, hum!</i>

37:50.144 --> 37:51.437
KUTNER: We're gonna use
flashing lights.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.565
Noxious stimulation,
it'll irritate your brain.

37:54.690 --> 37:55.858
If there's damage
to your neurons,

37:55.983 --> 37:58.486
it'll trigger a seizure.
That way we can...

37:58.611 --> 38:01.113
I got something
much more noxious.

38:03.658 --> 38:08.746
It's not as commonly used, but sound
can be just as big an irritant.

38:16.045 --> 38:18.839
Now remind me
of your influences here!

38:18.965 --> 38:22.051
'Cause I'm gonna
say Thelonious Monk

38:22.176 --> 38:25.888
and the sound a trash compactor
makes when you crawl inside it.

38:28.557 --> 38:31.310
I don't do it for you.
I do it for me.

38:40.194 --> 38:42.571
What do you think?
Is he seizing or dancing?

38:42.697 --> 38:44.031
Seizing.

38:44.156 --> 38:46.117
Play him the B side,
it's even worse.

38:46.242 --> 38:48.327
Schedule an OR
for the biopsy.

39:18.482 --> 39:22.445
A little mood music,

39:22.903 --> 39:24.280
Sounds more folky.

39:26.073 --> 39:29.452
You seriously have no idea
when to shut up, do you?

39:31.412 --> 39:33.289
HOUSE: Amber, please stand.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.044
You didn't call me bitch.
Is that bad?

39:40.671 --> 39:44.091
You played the game
better than anybody else here,

39:45.634 --> 39:47.219
but for the wrong reasons.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.388
Reasons don't matter.
Results are the only thing...

39:49.513 --> 39:50.848
You were wrong.

39:55.853 --> 39:59.482
Twenty years ago, this was recorded
by Jim Moskowitz,

40:00.232 --> 40:02.568
who later became
known as Jimmy Quidd.

40:04.904 --> 40:09.533
Loves kids, apparently has a heart,
perhaps even a soul.

40:12.495 --> 40:14.497
If you're gonna work for me,

40:14.622 --> 40:18.459
you have to be
willing to be wrong, willing to lose.

40:20.044 --> 40:21.754
Because you just did.

40:22.379 --> 40:23.756
You're fired.

40:33.307 --> 40:35.434
Thirteen, please stand.

40:40.689 --> 40:41.816
You're fired.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.322
You just said
I was right about...

40:48.447 --> 40:50.199
He was a drug addict.

40:54.703 --> 40:56.872
Four applicants,
two spots.

I'd keep you.

Kutner and Taub.

42:08.110 --> 42:09.361
Because I knew
you wouldn't.

42:09.486 --> 42:10.321
Oops.

I can't let you
hire two men.

42:12.323 --> 42:13.407
Now, that is sexist.

Hire a woman, too.

gives a crap about people.

- They both do.
- Right.

42:27.338 --> 42:28.714
Hire Thirteen.

42:37.306 --> 42:39.516
This was your plan
all along.

Well, at least
the games are over.
