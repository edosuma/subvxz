00:47.422 --> 00:48.256
Hey!

00:48.339 --> 00:51.968
Pandy lost his night light,
so we made him a new one.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.720
Ta-da!

00:54.262 --> 00:56.556
It has all the things that Pandy loves,

00:56.639 --> 00:57.849
like pickles,

00:57.932 --> 00:59.267
bananas.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.770
It even has his paw print. See?

01:02.312 --> 01:06.775
But there is one thing about it
that is super cool!

01:06.858 --> 01:08.943
Do you want to see it? All right.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.073
It's a glow-mobile!

01:14.574 --> 01:16.326
Pretty paw-tastic, right?

01:18.411 --> 01:22.373
-It's a Dollhouse Delivery!

01:22.457 --> 01:23.708
At night!

01:23.792 --> 01:25.043
How exciting!

01:25.126 --> 01:26.920
Come on, let's go check it out!

01:37.472 --> 01:42.227
OK. Let's see what kind of night-time
surprise the Meow Meow Mailbox has for us.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.272
Ooh!

01:46.356 --> 01:47.857
Look at this.

01:48.733 --> 01:53.279
Our Kitty Cat Surprise Box
is also glow-in-the-dark.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.406
Let's see what's inside.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.160
What?

02:00.495 --> 02:01.830
Another box!

02:02.455 --> 02:04.249
With a picture of a train on it.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.667
See?

02:05.750 --> 02:10.547
There's an engine and one,
two, three little cars.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.799
Do you think there's a train in here?

02:12.882 --> 02:13.842
Me too.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.761
All right.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.807
Hey, wait a minute.

02:21.391 --> 02:27.397
The engine is here,
but one, two, three cars are missing.

02:28.022 --> 02:28.898
Hmm.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.236
Maybe someone in the Dollhouse can
help us out with the three missing cars.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.865
Let's take a picture
of what the three missing cars look like

02:36.948 --> 02:39.492
so we can show the Gabby Cats later.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.577
See?

02:42.078 --> 02:45.081
OK. We just need to take this little guy.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.750
Let's get in there.

02:50.628 --> 02:51.713
Oh!

02:51.796 --> 02:54.132
DJ Catnip loves things that glow.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.801
He's gonna love this little glow-engine.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.012
We'll be right in, DJ.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.681
Time to get tiny.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.903
I'm in the music room. Come on in!

03:16.362 --> 03:18.197
Welcome to my Dollhouse.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.908
Wow!

03:19.991 --> 03:22.201
Look at our train engine.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.037
It's glow-mazing!

03:24.120 --> 03:26.956
DJ Catnip is gonna love this.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.166
Right, Pandy?

03:29.417 --> 03:30.418
Pandy?

03:31.127 --> 03:32.462
Do you see Pandy?

03:35.173 --> 03:36.633
Hug attack!

03:38.593 --> 03:41.012
Whoa! That was a good one!

03:41.095 --> 03:42.305
Choo-choo!

03:43.139 --> 03:44.599
Hey, hey, kitty cats!

03:46.392 --> 03:48.853
-Chugga-choo-choo! Ha-ha!

03:48.937 --> 03:50.855
This is one funky engine!

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
We thought you'd like it.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.277
You know I'm all about
that beat and that glow.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.284
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:05.370 --> 04:08.665
The train lost its music and its glow!

04:08.748 --> 04:09.999
That's not cool!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.544
Hmm. I wonder what's wrong?

04:13.628 --> 04:16.172
Maybe it has something to do
with the missing cars.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.175
-W-W-Wha… Missing cars?
-Yeah, look.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.053
This is what the whole train
is supposed to look like.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.306
But when we opened the box,
the three cars were missing.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.936
Hmm. Maybe the engine needs
the other cars to power up.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.771
But they weren't in the box.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.481
We don't have any other cars.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.609
We don't have them… yet!

04:36.693 --> 04:37.694
Let's think.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.446
We need three train cars
to make the engine run.

04:41.030 --> 04:45.493
Where are we gonna get
these three train cars? Hmm.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.454
Maybe we could build them.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.914
Hoo-hoo!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.874
Nice thinking, Pandy!

04:51.958 --> 04:55.336
And I've got a groovy idea
that just might work.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.507
Show me that first train car, Gabby.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.969
The first train car
is the one right next to the engine.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.178
Here it is.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.308
OK. To build the car, we need a rectangle.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.940
Two circles for the wheels.

05:19.819 --> 05:24.490
And two triangle connectors,
one on the front and one on the back.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.121
Yes!

05:30.204 --> 05:32.457
That looks
just like the train car we need.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.000
But how do we make it real?

05:34.083 --> 05:37.545
Well, if we're building
a musical train car out of shapes,

05:37.628 --> 05:41.424
let's see what happens if we play
instruments that are these same shapes.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.885
I say we give it a go.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.095
Let's start with the circle wheels.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.474
Do you see an instrument
shaped like a circle?

05:52.769 --> 05:53.978
The tambourine!

06:01.778 --> 06:04.030
We've got wheels!

06:04.113 --> 06:07.158
Now, let's find
a rectangle-shaped instrument.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.244
Do you see an instrument
shaped like a rectangle?

06:11.996 --> 06:14.832
-Yeah, the harmonica!

06:18.711 --> 06:19.962
All right!

06:21.631 --> 06:25.009
We just need to fill in
these two little triangles.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.804
We need to play
a triangle-shaped instrument.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.349
Which instrument is shaped
like a triangle?

06:34.352 --> 06:37.438
-The triangle, of course!

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
Should have seen that one coming.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.780
I love this instrument!

06:49.117 --> 06:52.370
We did it! We built the first train car!

06:52.954 --> 06:54.956
And check out that glow!

06:59.001 --> 07:00.753
Look! Train tracks!

07:00.837 --> 07:03.422
Whoa! I wonder where they lead?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.424
Let's get in there and find out.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.801
All aboard!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.555
We're going for a…

07:15.643 --> 07:16.894
Whoa.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.939
Check out all the glowing instruments.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.658
Uh-oh! Look!

07:30.741 --> 07:32.952
The train tracks end up ahead!

07:35.496 --> 07:39.333
Oh, no! We can't keep riding
if we don't have tracks!

07:42.462 --> 07:43.629
Did you see that?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.214
Yeah, I did!

07:45.298 --> 07:47.633
The train tracks grew
when that sound played.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.844
That sound was an instrument playing.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.430
If we can find the instrument
that makes that sound,

07:52.513 --> 07:55.099
we can play ourselves some train tracks!

07:56.767 --> 07:59.103
Which instrument makes this sound?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.737
-The guitar!
-I got this.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.451
Looks like we're back in business.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.495
And away we go!

08:24.378 --> 08:27.256
-Uh-oh! The tracks end again.

08:29.217 --> 08:33.596
Sounds like a different instrument sound
is making the tracks grow this time.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.058
Let's figure out which instrument
we need to play this time.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.810
Which instrument makes this sound?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.568
That's right, the trumpet!

08:49.153 --> 08:52.532
Hey, Gabby,
do you want to play us some… tracks?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.658
Ha-ha!

08:53.741 --> 08:58.663
Uh… I've never played the trumpet before,
but I'll give it a go.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.625
-Nicely played, Gabby!

09:09.048 --> 09:10.049
Not again!

09:12.093 --> 09:14.637
Let's figure out
what instrument makes that sound.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.520
The slide whistle!

09:23.271 --> 09:25.106
Ooh! Can I play this one?

09:25.189 --> 09:26.857
Be my guest, little buddy.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.739
-Nice playing, Pandy.
-Thanks!

09:37.201 --> 09:38.452
Look, up ahead!

09:40.955 --> 09:42.832
A glowing door?

09:42.915 --> 09:45.126
I wonder what's on the other side?

09:45.209 --> 09:47.295
Only one way to find out.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.797
Whoa!

09:49.880 --> 09:51.465
Oh, man!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.926
You guys are not gonna believe
where we are.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.139
What?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.224
We're in the playroom!

10:00.308 --> 10:02.768
That was one cool ride!

10:02.852 --> 10:06.105
This must be where we're gonna build
the next train car.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.065
All right, all right, little choo-choo.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.819
You head back to the music room
and we'll meet you there in a little bit.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.407
Beep-beep! Hey, guys!

10:16.490 --> 10:17.450
Hey, Carlita.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.118
Did I hear music?

10:19.201 --> 10:22.288
Yep. We're building musical train cars.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.875
We built this one, and it dropped us off
right here in the playroom.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.045
So, I figure we're gonna build
the next car right here.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.296
Oh!

10:30.379 --> 10:33.966
Well, that explains
these train tracks on the chalk wall.

10:35.176 --> 10:39.680
We definitely need to make a chalk car
to go with these chalk tracks.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.516
Then you're gonna need
some colorful chalk.

10:43.726 --> 10:44.727
Yes!

10:45.311 --> 10:46.687
Thanks, Carlita.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.650
OK, the car we need to draw
looks like this.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.277
What shapes do we need for the wheels?

10:55.112 --> 10:56.447
Circles!

10:56.530 --> 10:58.741
Two circle wheels coming up.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.120
Ha-ha! Nice!

11:03.204 --> 11:04.705
OK, let's see.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.625
What shapes do we need
for the car and the roof?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.629
That's a tough one.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.506
Those are trapezoids.

11:13.589 --> 11:18.052
That's a long line on one side
and a shorter line on the other,

11:18.135 --> 11:20.721
and two slanted lines to connect them.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.890
Trapezoids.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.434
I love that shape!

11:25.518 --> 11:28.771
Now, what shape do we need
for the poles to hold up the roof?

11:30.731 --> 11:32.191
Rectangles!

11:32.274 --> 11:34.568
Two skinny rectangles.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.612
Almost done!

11:37.446 --> 11:38.906
What shapes are these?

11:41.909 --> 11:43.869
-Triangles!
-Got it!

11:43.953 --> 11:46.080
Two triangles for the connectors,

11:46.163 --> 11:49.667
and one triangle
for the little roof topper.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.293
Thanks, DJ.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.379
So cool!

11:53.462 --> 11:56.799
Hey, what do you say?
Should we see where this car takes us?

11:56.882 --> 11:59.009
Let's give it a glow!

11:59.093 --> 12:03.013
Uh, oops. I mean, let's give it a go!

12:03.097 --> 12:04.473
Bye, Carlita.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.979
-And away we go!

12:10.062 --> 12:11.230
Happy travels!

12:16.068 --> 12:19.113
Ah, that sun feels nice.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.073
Ah, sure does.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.659
Gabby, check this out!

12:28.205 --> 12:29.457
Paw-esome!

12:29.540 --> 12:30.541
Paw bump!

12:31.375 --> 12:32.418
Uh, guys?

12:32.501 --> 12:34.378
I think we have a problem up ahead.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.756
-How are we getting over that big ravine?

12:38.340 --> 12:41.969
I have an idea.
I think I can draw something to fix that.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.762
Catnip, get me up there.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.098
Ha-ha! No problem, Pandy.

12:50.269 --> 12:54.190
What can I draw to help the train car
get over this ravine?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.860
A bridge! Yes!

13:03.616 --> 13:05.784
-Woohoo!

13:05.868 --> 13:08.496
Yeah, Pandy! You made us a bridge!

13:09.663 --> 13:14.126
That was some quick thinking.
You guys really saved the day on that one.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.630
Uh-oh!

13:17.713 --> 13:19.798
-Look! A lion!

13:19.882 --> 13:21.926
Aww! He's napping.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.178
Napping? On train tracks?

13:24.261 --> 13:25.804
Not a good idea.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.265
We've got to get him to move
off the tracks.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.475
I've got this.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.394
Pandy,
hand me that piece of chalk, please.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.939
Are you sure about this one, Gabby?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.232
Of course.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.236
Lions are basically big cats,

13:40.319 --> 13:43.364
and no one loves cats more than me.

13:43.447 --> 13:48.202
I'm sure I can figure out some way
to get that big kitty to move. DJ?

13:48.285 --> 13:49.870
You go, Gabby!

13:53.499 --> 13:54.333
OK.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.920
Lions are big cats, like Floyd.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.422
And when I want to get Floyd moving…

14:01.382 --> 14:04.009
I use his favorite kitty toy!

14:09.765 --> 14:11.517
Let's see how the lion likes it.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.186
-Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

14:14.270 --> 14:15.271
Say it with me.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.898
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

14:17.982 --> 14:20.067
-Roar?

14:20.150 --> 14:22.069
I think he likes it.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.531
-Hmm?
-Now we just need to get him to move.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.784
Say it with me.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.370
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.497
Roar!

14:34.123 --> 14:35.374
We did it!

14:35.457 --> 14:37.835
We got this big kitty off the tracks!

14:42.089 --> 14:44.592
This is your toy now, big guy.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.802
-Hey, kitty cat!

14:47.344 --> 14:49.054
Yay, Gabby!

14:49.138 --> 14:50.681
Goodbye, Mr. Lion.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.765
Roar!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.560
Another mystery door ahead!

14:56.103 --> 14:58.480
I wonder where we're going this time.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.819
-The bathroom?
-The bathroom!

15:03.903 --> 15:07.406
Oh, this is perfect because, uh…

15:07.489 --> 15:09.783
I need a quick potty break.
I'll be right back.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.121
See you back in the music room, train car.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.542
Let's see what we need to build next.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.753
We had the engine already,

15:20.836 --> 15:23.964
and we built one, two cars.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.718
Only one more car to build.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.886
Yep.

15:28.969 --> 15:32.139
We just need to build this caboose
and make it glow.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.350
Hey, everyone!

15:34.433 --> 15:36.352
-Hey, MerCat.
-Hey, MerCat.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.313
-I'm back! Hey, MerCat!

15:39.396 --> 15:41.815
We need to build a glowing train caboose.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.276
Do you have anything glowy
we can build with?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.277
Huh.

15:45.819 --> 15:46.820
Hang on!

15:48.280 --> 15:49.949
I have these glow sticks.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.078
Paw-esome!

15:57.665 --> 15:58.832
Did you see that?

15:58.916 --> 16:01.627
Pandy! You made a circle!

16:01.710 --> 16:04.338
That circle could be a wheel
for our caboose.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.091
-Hmm.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.258
Yeah!

16:08.342 --> 16:11.595
If only we could get it to stay
instead of fading away.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.807
I have a mer-mazing spray
that will do just the trick.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.810
Super Stay Mer-Tastic Spray!

16:17.893 --> 16:21.355
Pandy, let me see
one of those circles.

16:24.566 --> 16:25.651
It worked!

16:25.734 --> 16:26.819
Thanks, MerCat.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.321
We have ourselves a train wheel.

16:30.781 --> 16:31.865
Let's see.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.910
How many circles do we need
to build the caboose?

16:38.539 --> 16:39.373
Two!

16:39.456 --> 16:43.043
Pandy made the first circle.
Do you want to make the second one?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.421
Cat-tastic!

16:45.504 --> 16:47.464
Here, hold this glow stick.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.385
Now, move your arm in a circle, like this.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.512
Give it a go.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.306
It's working!

16:56.890 --> 16:57.891
Got it!

17:00.310 --> 17:01.895
Great job!

17:05.107 --> 17:08.277
-What other shapes do we need, Gabby?
-Let's check.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.571
How many triangles do we need?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.366
Three!

17:14.450 --> 17:16.368
Thee triangles coming up!

17:26.295 --> 17:29.673
How many rectangles do we need
to build the caboose?

17:31.842 --> 17:32.676
Two!

17:32.760 --> 17:33.886
Coming up!

17:37.056 --> 17:38.057
Ooh! Got it!

17:42.936 --> 17:44.772
Only one more shape.

17:44.855 --> 17:45.856
What is it?

17:48.358 --> 17:49.651
A square!

17:50.444 --> 17:52.821
Do you want to make the last shape?

17:52.905 --> 17:53.864
Great!

17:53.947 --> 17:57.201
Just move your arm in a square, like this.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.121
Give it a go.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.168
Got it!

18:13.592 --> 18:14.635
Great job!

18:15.969 --> 18:17.304
We did it!

18:17.387 --> 18:20.140
We built all the missing train cars!

18:20.224 --> 18:24.561
Do you think the engine will come alive
again when we hook up the new cars?

18:24.645 --> 18:26.730
Only one way to find out.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.691
Let's get back to the music room!

18:31.193 --> 18:33.112
-Chugga-choo-choo!

18:34.363 --> 18:37.324
Thanks for your help, MerCat.
You da bubbles!

18:38.575 --> 18:41.370
The glow-tastic bubbles! Ooh!

18:43.163 --> 18:44.498
All right.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.668
Let's hook up this caboose
and see what happens!

18:52.005 --> 18:53.757
Oh, I hope this works!

18:53.841 --> 18:55.050
Let's see.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.473
-Yes!
-OK, OK. Here we go.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.729
Oh-ho-ho! We've got that glow!

19:08.730 --> 19:11.567
OK, big engine, it's your turn.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.111
Oh, I hope it works!

19:17.573 --> 19:18.907
We did it!

19:18.991 --> 19:21.118
We brought the engine back to life!

19:21.201 --> 19:22.536
Choo-choo!

19:22.619 --> 19:25.080
All right, cats and kittens!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.916
It's time for a Dollhouse glow ride!

19:51.398 --> 19:54.026
Don't forget about Carlita.
Beep-beep!

19:57.738 --> 20:00.240
Thanks for helping us on our glow ride.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.451
Are you ready for another surprise?

20:16.381 --> 20:19.051
It's me, DJ Catnip!

22:11.121 --> 22:12.247
Whoo!

22:12.331 --> 22:16.001
That was one groovy,
glow-tastic adventure.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.127
Right, Pandy?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.880
Uh, Pandy!

22:28.972 --> 22:31.224
I think his new night light worked.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.436
Thanks for coming
on the glow ride with us.

22:34.519 --> 22:38.607
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.942
Bye! Shh!
