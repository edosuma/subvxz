WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:02.480
- Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:02.524 --> 00:04.830
I plan on asking Nora
to marry me.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.267
- Yes.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.572
- You don't understand how
dangerous that Loom is.

00:07.616 --> 00:08.747
- Come on, Charlie.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.140
We'll use the Loom
to help Astra,

00:10.184 --> 00:11.663
and then I will help you
destroy it forever.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.056
Deal?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.275
- Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.754
- Cute, you have a troll.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.365
- This your kid?
- She's your kid too.

00:17.408 --> 00:18.931
- Nora belongs
in the real world.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.629
I need you to support her.

00:20.672 --> 00:21.934
And she can't do it
on that ship of yours.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.284
Do the right thing, son.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.652
- Morning, babe.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.567
- Hey.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.178
- You okay?

00:48.222 --> 00:50.963
- Actually, I was thinking
about your dad.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.879
- That's romantic.

00:53.923 --> 00:57.057
- Thinking about something
he said to me.

00:57.100 --> 01:01.409
When I committed my life
to you, I meant it.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.715
So I've been thinking

01:03.759 --> 01:07.328
maybe our life together
isn't on the ship.

01:07.371 --> 01:10.026
Maybe it's time for us
to move on

01:10.070 --> 01:12.028
and move out.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.117
Together.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.685
- Whoa, hey.

01:16.728 --> 01:20.906
Listen, I wanna build a life
with you wherever we are.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.257
- I know, but...

01:23.300 --> 01:25.607
you can't really do your job
on a timeship.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.565
- What about the Legends?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.132
- They've become my family,

01:29.176 --> 01:32.048
but we can't begin
our life together

01:32.092 --> 01:35.312
when I literally have one foot
in the past.

01:35.356 --> 01:41.057
So I think I'll do one last
mission with the team

01:41.101 --> 01:43.233
and say good-bye.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.454
- Wow.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.761
We're doing this.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.764
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.027
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.206
- Mmm.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.077
Yeah, but maybe after
we brush our teeth.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.253
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.649
- Come on!
Is she still in there?

02:08.954 --> 02:10.217
- Zari, there's a line!

02:10.260 --> 02:11.827
- I'm doing my hair.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.959
You can't stop
the glam routine mid-process.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.787
- Come on,
we talked about this!

02:15.831 --> 02:17.702
- Ooh, let me guess.
Zari?

02:17.746 --> 02:19.095
- Huh?
- Hey.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.575
What happened to
the sign-up sheet I made?

02:20.618 --> 02:22.011
- Oh, Mick burned it
in frustration

02:22.054 --> 02:24.274
after Zari's last
Korean sheet mask day.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.277
- Well, um, I guess now
is as good a time as any

02:27.321 --> 02:29.236
to tell you two that

02:29.279 --> 02:31.238
Nora and I have some big news--

02:31.281 --> 02:32.413
- We talking big news?

02:32.456 --> 02:34.197
'Cause, guys, I got a whopper.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.807
I told John we'd help him find
the Loom of Fate.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.592
- Nuh-uh.
You know the rules.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.463
No MacGuffin talk until
after I've finished my coffee.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.986
- Yeah, and besides,
you guys were about to

02:41.030 --> 02:42.640
make a big announcement?
- Yes.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.381
-  Is it time
for morning announcements?

02:44.425 --> 02:46.905
'Cause I need you all to know,
I have to go so badly.

02:46.949 --> 02:49.473
If my sister ever leaves
the bathroom!

02:49.517 --> 02:50.474
- Oh, B!
- Come on.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.302
- Hey, bro,

02:52.346 --> 02:53.608
let's not pretend like
you don't take this long

02:53.651 --> 02:55.479
with your hair.
- Get in line.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.873
- Bathroom's are also
for other things.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.831
- And in other announcements--

02:59.875 --> 03:02.007
- She still in there?

03:02.051 --> 03:04.401
I would be too
if I had all that damn hair.

03:04.445 --> 03:07.230
- Okay, well, uh,
this is the perfect time,

03:07.274 --> 03:08.666
now that we're all here,

03:08.710 --> 03:11.887
to let you know
that Nora and I--

03:11.930 --> 03:14.019
- You're moving out.
- Hmm?

03:14.063 --> 03:15.934
- How'd you know that?
- Well, you got married.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.980
Next logical step
in a relationship--

03:18.023 --> 03:19.634
and by the way,

03:19.677 --> 03:21.723
I heard you two going at it
like jackrabbits last night.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.203
- Mm-hmm.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.204
- Hey, at least
someone's getting it.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.335
- Oh, my God.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.643
- Look, after
one final mission,

03:28.686 --> 03:30.775
Nora and I will be leaving.

03:30.819 --> 03:31.950
- Aw, I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Wait, for real?

03:31.994 --> 03:33.343
- Seriously?
- Congrats!

03:33.387 --> 03:35.258
- I mean, we always knew
this day would come,

03:35.302 --> 03:37.565
but I never thought
it would be so soon.

03:37.608 --> 03:38.957
- How are you gonna tell Nate?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.437
- Tell Nate what?
- What?

03:44.485 --> 03:45.790
- Hmm?

03:45.834 --> 03:48.053
- Uh--

03:48.097 --> 03:50.186
The wait for the bathroom
is upwards of 30 minutes.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.232
Can you believe it?
- Hey, take it easy.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.756
At least I get to wait in line
with the happy new couple.

03:54.799 --> 03:57.628
Nora, welcome to
your new morning routine.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.717
Uptown!

03:59.761 --> 04:01.284
- Thank God.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.591
- Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.680
- Damn, she looks good.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.856
- Glam complete.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.859
You guys could really work
on your hygiene.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.601
- It's 7:15.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.483
- Mick!

04:26.527 --> 04:29.007
There you are.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.313
- Mona.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.795
- Consent to hug you?

04:33.838 --> 04:36.754
- I'll take that as a no.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.800
So what's new?

04:38.843 --> 04:40.497
Any torrid affairs,

04:40.541 --> 04:43.065
flourishing romances,
lovers left behind?

04:43.108 --> 04:46.068
Rebecca Silver could always use
fresh inspiration.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.113
- No.
- Anyway,

04:48.157 --> 04:50.333
had to be here
for Nora's first book club

04:50.377 --> 04:51.769
as a married woman.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.859
And speaking of books,
I could use your advice.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.209
Rebecca Silver has been
besieged by a troll.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.994
- Forget about her--
I mean--him.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.387
Whoever.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.040
- Well, I tried that
and it didn't stop.

05:02.084 --> 05:04.042
I was thinking of reaching out.
- Don't.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.740
It's just gonna make you
feel worse.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.219
- Well, I think
it's a cry for help.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.960
Maybe someone just needs
to show them love.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.267
- But it's got nothing
to do with love!

05:15.140 --> 05:16.359
- Hey.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.969
I was packing up
my stuff in the lab,

05:18.013 --> 05:19.710
and I noticed that
Marie Antoinette is gone,

05:19.754 --> 05:21.408
and the jars of Rasputin
are empty.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.627
- Astra must have
recalled their souls to Hell.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.456
Damien said something about
eternal torture.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.372
So, um, packing huh?

05:29.416 --> 05:31.635
You talked to Nate yet?
- Ha.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.854
When I saw his face
back there,

05:32.897 --> 05:34.421
I-I just couldn't.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.640
He was so excited about
us living together.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.382
I just have to wait for
the perfect moment, you know?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.950
- Look, I say
just get it over with,

05:41.993 --> 05:44.169
and then you guys can enjoy
your last hoorah together.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.432
- Yeah.

05:45.475 --> 05:46.781
Saying good-bye to Nate's

05:46.824 --> 05:47.999
my biggest mission yet.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.566
- Mm-hmm.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.569
I did go to the moon once,
so second biggest.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.486
- The Loom of Fate.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.097
Eons ago, I tossed it
through space and time

05:59.141 --> 06:02.797
because it was too dangerous,
but now for all my sins,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.364
we're gonna piece it
back together again.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.844
- And finally put an end
to our encore problem.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.673
- By rewriting Astra's life and
setting her on the right path.

06:09.717 --> 06:13.285
- Yes, speaking
of life changes...

06:16.550 --> 06:19.596
- Must be a life-changing
experience for you, Charlie,

06:19.640 --> 06:21.859
to know that the Loom is back
on our Earth.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.295
Huh?
Charlie?

06:23.339 --> 06:24.993
- Yeah, it is.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.038
But there's only one piece
who's spot I'm sure of.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.823
I gave it to a close mate
of mine for safekeeping.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.130
- All right, so we go back to
right after you dropped it off.

06:32.174 --> 06:36.178
That's our move.
- And, uh, speaking of moves...

06:37.919 --> 06:39.442
- Let's get a move on it!

06:40.704 --> 06:42.445
Where are we headed,
Charlie?

06:42.489 --> 06:45.666
- Well, the last place
I left it was in London 1594.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.712
- Gideon, set a course.
- Affirmative, Captain.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.193
And speaking of setting
a new course...

06:51.236 --> 06:54.805
- Of course, she means, Sara,
please give us one of those

06:54.849 --> 06:58.287
terrific period-specific
send-offs.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.507
- Fine.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.031
Enjoy the jolly old London,

07:03.074 --> 07:05.033
ya blokes!

07:07.818 --> 07:09.864
- That was--
that was bad.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.301
- And frankly offensive.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.484
- Oh, it warms my cockles

07:21.528 --> 07:23.660
to know that Londoners
haven't changed a bit.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.880
Let's find this bloody
Loom piece, shall we?

07:25.923 --> 07:27.925
- Well, I disguised the pieces
as rings.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.666
And this one I gave
to a close mate of mine,

07:29.710 --> 07:31.886
and if I know him,
he'll be here.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.583
Wasn't a day he didn't stop by
for a pint.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.759
- Why stop at one pint?

07:35.803 --> 07:39.328
- Hmm, well, I found our guy.
Will the Quill.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.808
- You didn't tell me
you were friends

07:40.851 --> 07:42.418
with the real
William Shakespeare.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.464
- Well, I didn't wanna
name drop.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.251
- Pardon the intrusion, squire.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.209
We have the knowledge
that you came into possession

07:51.253 --> 07:54.952
of a particular ring
some several days past.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.738
- I know not of what you speak,
good constables.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.001
And why should anyone
hand me a ring?

08:00.044 --> 08:01.437
Do I appear as a jeweler
to thine eyes?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.830
It's a pity!

08:02.873 --> 08:04.527
Because that ring was stolen

08:04.571 --> 08:06.660
from the Duke--

08:06.703 --> 08:08.531
- And he wants it back!

08:08.575 --> 08:11.186
And if it were to be discovered
that someone had lied

08:11.229 --> 08:13.405
about its whereabouts...

08:13.449 --> 08:17.105
Let's just say
heads would roll.

08:17.148 --> 08:19.107
- Y-yes, the ring!

08:19.150 --> 08:21.152
The ring,
now I remember it well.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.024
Would that I could yield it
for you,

08:23.067 --> 08:24.721
but I just sold that
very ring of which you speak.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.114
- What?

08:26.157 --> 08:27.550
You sold it already,
you lousy git?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
- It was by necessity.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.207
See, a stubborn case
of writer's block

08:32.250 --> 08:34.383
is preventing me
from finding the ending

08:34.426 --> 08:36.951
to my new play,
"Romeo and Juliet."

08:36.994 --> 08:38.909
- Sounds
like an instant classic.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.912
- My producer, Philip Henslowe,
has threatened to remove me

08:41.956 --> 08:44.872
of hands by way of sword
if I can't finish.

08:44.915 --> 08:48.440
Thus I gave him the ring
in exchange for more time.

08:48.484 --> 08:51.313
If I can't bring
my story to a close,

08:51.356 --> 08:54.011
my career is over.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.972
- So much for quick and easy.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.587
- Discussing "Romeo and Juliet"

09:04.631 --> 09:07.242
in Elizabethan England.
- Mm.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.418
- Eva, you needed me?

09:09.461 --> 09:12.247
Sorry, is this an intervention?

09:12.290 --> 09:13.509
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.512
So since you're a member
of the team,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.383
we wanted to invite you
to book club!

09:18.427 --> 09:20.951
- Oh, that is very sweet,

09:20.995 --> 09:22.910
but I actually have a lot
on my plate right now,

09:22.953 --> 09:25.521
so I don't really have time
to talk about books.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.523
- The thing about
book club is, uh,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.003
we don't really talk
about books.

09:29.046 --> 09:32.180
- Mm-mm.
- Because book club is magic.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.531
- What she means is,
book club is a place

09:35.575 --> 09:36.924
where you can hang out
with your friends

09:36.967 --> 09:38.273
and talk about your problems.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.493
- And eat tiny crackers.
- And drink.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.714
- Well, according to
the iron monger at the bar,

09:44.758 --> 09:46.107
for 20 shillings I can get

09:46.150 --> 09:48.109
a bottle of wine
and a strumpet.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.415
Also, Henslowe
and his goons just arrived

09:50.459 --> 09:52.287
and they're right over there.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.898
- Yeah, I can see the ring
on his hand.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.465
I doubt he's gonna give it up
so easily.

09:56.508 --> 09:57.988
- Bah, it's simple.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.381
You distract the goons,

09:59.424 --> 10:01.644
and I'll punch the producer
in the face.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.777
Anyone got 20 shillings?

10:03.820 --> 10:05.779
- Wh-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.042
This mission has to be epic.
Okay?

10:08.085 --> 10:12.481
By which I mean, extremely well
and elaborately coordinated.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.700
- Ray's right.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.399
And I have the perfect plan.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.663
We have the element
of surprise on our side,

10:20.707 --> 10:22.883
so I say aerial attack.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.102
I'll rappel down
while he's totally distracted.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.888
- Love it, and then
I'll rappel next to Nate.

10:27.931 --> 10:32.153
- And then we'll high-five
mid-air, and it will be epic.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.676
And then--

10:33.720 --> 10:36.113
wait, Ray, are you crying?

10:36.157 --> 10:37.898
- It's just that,
I love this plan.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.464
- Oh, yeah--hey, man,
I get it.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.118
I'm a little choked up.
It's a great plan.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
And then we'll land
behind Henslowe

10:43.425 --> 10:45.296
to his total surprise!

10:46.994 --> 10:48.212
- We'll subdue him,
and I'll grab the ring.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.736
Ah, got it!

10:49.779 --> 10:51.999
- Then, Behrad will air blast
Henslowe's thugs

10:52.042 --> 10:53.609
with a killer gust of wind!

10:54.958 --> 10:56.699
- Dude, I don't dance
like that.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.876
- And then Constantine will
emerge from the shadows,

10:59.920 --> 11:02.705
per uzh...
- Oh, yambo bambo mumbo jumbo!

11:02.749 --> 11:06.187
- Spout some nonsense and cast
a spell on any troublemakers

11:06.230 --> 11:08.624
to make them think
that they're animals.

11:10.365 --> 11:14.064
- And then we go to Star City,
we pick up Wild Dog,

11:14.108 --> 11:15.413
and we--
- Oy!

11:15.457 --> 11:17.720
Story time's over.
I got it.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.114
- How the hell did you do that?
- Well, I just nicked it off

11:20.157 --> 11:21.724
his hand while
you lot were prattling on.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.639
- Does that mean
the mission is over?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.032
- Which is why we should, uh,

11:25.075 --> 11:26.816
get moving, find that next
Loom piece, yeah?

11:26.860 --> 11:29.297
- It's time for you to go,
haircut.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.820
- Wait, where are you going?

11:32.474 --> 11:34.606
- On--on my honeymoon.

11:34.650 --> 11:38.610
Nora and I are going to
Bermuda--Bahamas.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.090
- Shut up!

11:40.134 --> 11:41.657
You're doing the whole
Kokomo package?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.137
Bro, you're gonna be gone
for weeks.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.356
I didn't even throw you
a proper bachelor party.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.837
- The mission
isn't officially over

11:47.881 --> 11:49.665
until we bring the ring
back to the ship, right?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.667
- Which is where we should be
going right now.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.973
Come on, let's go.
- Ray!

11:53.016 --> 11:54.365
You're not going anywhere.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.585
Grab your doublet
and your ruffs,

11:56.628 --> 11:58.413
because this bachelor party
is gonna be

11:58.456 --> 12:01.764
an Elizabethan extravaganza!

12:01.808 --> 12:03.113
- You know the other thing
about book club is,

12:03.157 --> 12:04.462
it can help you figure out

12:04.506 --> 12:05.812
where your true path
is supposed to be--

12:05.855 --> 12:08.379
- Oh, so this is a cult.
- No. No, no, no.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.990
We don't--
we don't use certain C-words.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.470
Cult, clone...
- I would know,

12:12.514 --> 12:14.864
because book club helped me
move forward

12:14.908 --> 12:16.518
after my time in a real cult.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.128
- Look, I get
your reservations.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.913
The last "club" I joined

12:19.956 --> 12:21.697
programmed me
to be an assassin.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.004
But book club is helping me
be a real person.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.962
- And I killed a federal agent.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.443
I meant to lead with,

12:28.486 --> 12:31.751
"I'm a Kaupe--it's like
a Hawaiian Werewolf."

12:31.794 --> 12:33.883
Book club helped me cope
with that.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.972
- That's also a lot.
Okay.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.321
- So what do you think, Zari?

12:37.365 --> 12:39.715
Can book club help you?

12:42.370 --> 12:44.154
- You know what?
Enough about me.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.330
This is Nora's last book club.

12:46.374 --> 12:50.291
Shouldn't we be throwing her
a belated bachelorette bash?

12:50.334 --> 12:51.596
- Yes!

12:51.640 --> 12:52.859
- Yes!
- That's what I'm saying!

12:52.902 --> 12:54.643
Right?

12:54.686 --> 12:55.949
- Captain, I have
an incoming transmission.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.820
- Let's get firemen.
- It's the boys!

12:57.864 --> 12:59.691
Shh!
- What?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.868
- Hey, Sara, sorry
the mission's taking so long.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.000
It's just a dog took the ring,

13:04.044 --> 13:07.003
and it turned out to be the,
um, you know, the Queen's dog.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.397
But we got it covered.
We're good.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.704
- Well, great.
Then, uh, keep us posted

13:12.748 --> 13:15.620
and be safe.
- Copy that.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.622
Fill 'em up!
She bought it.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.018
- All right, the boys
are gonna be a while,

13:22.062 --> 13:24.891
so pop that champagne
and fill her up!

13:24.934 --> 13:26.370
- Whoo!

13:27.502 --> 13:31.462
- I notice John Constantine
is walking topside.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.596
- Plans changed.
I needed leverage.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.641
John is working for me now.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.774
He promised me something.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.342
- What exactly is
John Constantine doing for you,

13:41.385 --> 13:42.952
Astra?

13:42.996 --> 13:46.521
- He said something about
some powerful artifact.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.132
Whatever it is,
that can bring my mom back.

13:51.221 --> 13:55.269
I'd have a family again.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.403
- So...

13:59.447 --> 14:03.190
John makes this grand promise
to bring your family back,

14:03.233 --> 14:06.889
and you quickly forget
that I am the one who found you

14:06.933 --> 14:08.978
roaming the streets
as a child.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.154
I'm the one who pulled you
from the gutter.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.939
I raised you--
- No, no, I--

14:12.982 --> 14:16.333
I haven't forgotten.
- Then did it occur to you

14:16.377 --> 14:17.900
if John brings
your mother back,

14:17.944 --> 14:20.990
I will no longer
be in your life?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.036
- You know I don't want that.

14:23.079 --> 14:27.127
You are my family.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.303
- If there's a way to discover
what he's after

14:29.346 --> 14:31.435
maybe you could get it
for yourself.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.353
I know a way we can find out.

14:38.181 --> 14:42.011
This is an exspiravitritual.

14:42.055 --> 14:45.319
It will allow you to see
the other side.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.147
You'll be among those on Earth

14:47.190 --> 14:50.193
able to spy on John
like a ghost.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.891
You sure you're ready?

14:58.723 --> 15:00.682
- Fill it up.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.264
- Go on, Ray,
say a few words.

15:17.307 --> 15:20.354
- Speech, speech!
- Speech, speech.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.574
- Um, I just wanna say,

15:23.618 --> 15:26.403
thank you for this, uh,
bachelor party

15:26.447 --> 15:28.275
you're the best friend
a guy could have.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.233
- No, no.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.756
Because you are!
- Ah!

15:31.800 --> 15:33.323
You are!
- You are!

15:33.367 --> 15:36.239
- Is there anything else
you'd like to say, Ray?

15:36.283 --> 15:38.415
- Mm-mm.

15:38.459 --> 15:42.680
- Anyone have any big life
changes that they wanna reveal?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.947
- I got a kid.
- Wha--

15:47.990 --> 15:50.427
- Been trying to ignore her,
but I...

15:50.471 --> 15:52.560
can't stop
thinking about her.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.650
- Aw.
It's a good thing, Mick.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.434
- It's called love.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.002
- Wow, let's keep
this share-fest going.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.743
All right?
Who's next?

16:04.485 --> 16:05.965
- Whoo!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

16:06.008 --> 16:07.923
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.926
- ♪ First base, second base,
all the way home ♪

16:10.970 --> 16:15.017
♪ I can't go kissing alone

16:15.061 --> 16:18.064

- Hey, we're a regular old,
uh, Fellowship of the Ring.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.823
- Here's again to the first
piece of the Loom of Destiny!

16:38.867 --> 16:41.957
Here.
Yeah, the Spear of Fate.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.524
Do you remember the totems?

16:43.567 --> 16:45.134
- Mmm.
- The totems?

16:45.178 --> 16:46.440
I met Elvis.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.833
- I mean,
it's the Loom of Fate.

16:48.877 --> 16:52.098
All right, once we piece
it all together,

16:52.141 --> 16:54.230
we'll rewrite Astra's life.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.972
And I'm telling you all,
this is gonna be worth it.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.064
Who's there?

17:04.371 --> 17:05.937
Charge thee, speak.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.249
- Hey!

17:13.293 --> 17:15.817
Watch it,
you pigeon-livered worm!

17:15.860 --> 17:17.079
Piss off.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.516
- You want some?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.518
- Hey, leave him alone!

17:21.562 --> 17:24.304
- Hey!

17:35.010 --> 17:36.794
- What the devil?

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
Ack!
Ugh!

17:41.843 --> 17:43.105
- Oh!
- Yes, B!

17:43.149 --> 17:45.238
That was it!

17:45.281 --> 17:46.978
- Speak to me!

17:47.022 --> 17:49.546
What plane of Hell
did you surface?

17:49.590 --> 17:51.722
Well, whoever you are,

17:51.766 --> 17:53.768
I'm afraid I must do my duty

17:53.811 --> 17:57.815
and send you back.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.557
Fuge!

18:04.518 --> 18:05.519
- Astra!

18:05.562 --> 18:07.695
Astra?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.697
Astra?
Oh, no.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.571
- Yeah, buddy!

18:14.615 --> 18:19.185
- Ah, time for the Atom-eth,
to save-eth the day-eth.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.974
Deactivate suit!

18:26.017 --> 18:28.542
- Deactivate suit!

18:28.585 --> 18:31.588
- Sorry!
- Watch out!

18:31.632 --> 18:33.112
- Ow!

18:34.722 --> 18:37.072
- Code X-94.
X-94!

18:37.116 --> 18:40.162
- Doctor Palmer,
voice authenticated.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.600
- Yes!

18:49.084 --> 18:50.477
- Party's over!

18:50.520 --> 18:51.782
- Yeah, Jocko's right
about that one.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.175
- Zounds!

18:53.219 --> 18:54.655
- Yeah, we better
mind-wipe that dude.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.526
I got it.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.441
♪ Doot doot doodly,
doot doot doot ♪

18:58.485 --> 18:59.877
- Wait, no, no,
it's pointing the wrong way.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.401
- I got it.

19:03.098 --> 19:06.928
- Well, another
Legends mission perfect.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.886
Let's head back to the ship.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.282
Sorry.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.547
- No, you!
- I can't, I can't--

19:17.591 --> 19:20.637
I can't, I can't.
- Yes!

19:22.422 --> 19:23.945
- Hey!

19:23.988 --> 19:26.948
Turn off the music!

19:26.991 --> 19:28.863
Look at this.
Take a look at that.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.343
What is that?

19:30.386 --> 19:32.258
- Did something go wrong
with the mission?

19:32.301 --> 19:35.304
- Is that Mick?
- What's "Romeo v. Juliet?"

19:35.348 --> 19:38.133
- Shakespeare is writing
superhero plays?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.483
- Oh, that's gonna be
a problem.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.620
- I cannot believe you guys!

19:46.663 --> 19:48.926
I put you in charge of the
mission, and you lied to me.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.320
You--you lied to me.
- Ow.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.843
- So why--
so why, you could just--

19:52.887 --> 19:54.193
you could go party?

19:54.236 --> 19:55.803
- That's what
we should've done.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.153
We should've waited for
Ray and Nora to come back

19:58.197 --> 20:00.938
from their honeymoon
and throw one big party.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.940
My bad, buddy.
- Yeah, and guess what?

20:02.984 --> 20:04.899
We're well on our way
to assembling the Loom.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.293
- Uh, but you're right, Sara.
I really should've insisted

20:07.336 --> 20:09.164
that we come back
to the ship sooner.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.818
- Yeah.
- "Tybalt draws his sword

20:10.861 --> 20:14.256
on Mercutio, but Mercutio
turns to steel!"

20:14.300 --> 20:17.128
What?
- Well, thanks to you guys

20:17.172 --> 20:21.350
and your stupid party,
this mission's not over.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.657
- "With another swing,
Tybalt stabs Mercutio.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.049
'I am hurt.'"

20:25.093 --> 20:26.355
Why didn't he just
steel up again?

20:26.399 --> 20:27.791
Stupid Mercutio.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.532
- This is the least
of our worries.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.187
We need to get out there
and fix hiss-ory.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.015
- What's that?
- His-story.

20:34.058 --> 20:37.105
History--time!
We gotta fix time.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.889
- Une question, le Capitaine.
- What?

20:38.933 --> 20:40.717
- Are you sloshed?

20:40.761 --> 20:43.590
- Follow up question: why is
there glitter on your face?

20:43.633 --> 20:46.767
- Uh, looks like your tachyon
scrubber needs to be replaced.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.943
Whatever that means.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.641
- It's uh--

20:51.685 --> 20:53.991
just see this fine gentleman
out, thank you.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.732
- With pleasure.
- All right, let's go,

20:55.776 --> 20:58.213
sexy firefighter.
Go on and get.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.388
- Ray.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.390
Can I talk to you please?

21:01.434 --> 21:04.915
- Yeah, I'm--
mm-hmm.

21:08.179 --> 21:10.225
All right, Ray,
what's up?

21:10.269 --> 21:13.620
Why haven't you told Nate
that you're leaving?

21:13.663 --> 21:17.319
- Because he's my best friend,

21:17.363 --> 21:22.193
and the moment I tell him,
then this all becomes real.

21:22.237 --> 21:25.588
And, um, I know it's my choice,
it's my decision

21:25.632 --> 21:28.374
but I don't--I don't know
if I'm really ready for it.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.203
- You remember when
we first moved on the ship?

21:32.247 --> 21:34.815
We left our entire lives
behind us,

21:34.858 --> 21:37.731
we had no idea
what to expect,

21:37.774 --> 21:40.690
but because we embraced
the change--

21:40.734 --> 21:43.563
- We made history.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.434
- Sure did.

21:47.262 --> 21:51.571
Who would've thought
that we would still be here?

21:51.614 --> 21:54.530
And that we'd be
saying good-bye already.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.836
- I'll miss you,
Captain Lance.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.928
- Don't make me cry.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.409
I'm gonna miss you too, Ray.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.019
A lot.

22:05.062 --> 22:08.370
Come here.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.810
- Let's hope the actors
aren't off book yet.

22:13.854 --> 22:16.335
- You have to talk Shakespeare
out of his superhero play

22:16.378 --> 22:18.554
and make sure you get
those scripts.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.730
- Back, foul villain!

22:20.774 --> 22:22.384
Whoosh!

22:22.428 --> 22:23.951
- To the skies, brethren!

22:23.994 --> 22:26.301
For tonight
there will be justice!

22:26.345 --> 22:28.434
- Behold!

22:28.477 --> 22:30.653
What worthy hero faces me?

22:30.697 --> 22:32.829
- My face is silver,

22:32.873 --> 22:34.831
fists like thunder strikes!

22:34.875 --> 22:37.747
- We must collect the gems
to save the world!

22:37.791 --> 22:40.533
- While learning how to work
more as a team.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.664
- Yes.
- Come hither.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.579
We have much to discuss.

22:43.623 --> 22:46.887
- Wow, and it's still
in iambic pentameter.

22:46.930 --> 22:50.281
Okay, you guys take care of
the cast and get the scripts.

22:50.325 --> 22:51.805
I'll talk to Shakespeare.
- Copy.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.589
- Pew, pew, pew!
Pew, pew, pew!

22:53.633 --> 22:55.939
- Take to the skies, brethren!

22:55.983 --> 22:57.419
- I can't believe
we have to destroy these.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.986
This show has potential.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.557
Hear ye, hear ye.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.472
So there's been
a change of plans.

23:06.515 --> 23:09.126
You guys have been replaced
by "Riverdale."

23:13.217 --> 23:15.089
- William Shakespeare?
- Bother me not.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.352
I'm making amendments
to my script.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.180
I must elucidate more clearly

23:19.223 --> 23:21.138
what the steel man's takeaway
lesson is from the story.

23:21.182 --> 23:22.749
- Oh, well I'm actually here
to speak to you

23:22.792 --> 23:23.837
about your new play.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.534
- I know you.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.667
You're one of the constables
that asked for the ring.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.147
And you caused such a glorious
row with Henslowe and his men.

23:30.191 --> 23:33.412
- Yes, and now I'm here to say

23:33.455 --> 23:36.676
that you cannot put on
the show.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.721
- But I finally
struck inspiration.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.289
Look, I have a plan.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.946
Romeo and Juliet
will form a team,

23:45.989 --> 23:47.687
and I will henceforth
introduce the allies

23:47.730 --> 23:49.776
Hamlet, Viola, and Puck,

23:49.819 --> 23:52.953
who will join forces to face
Richard the Third!

23:52.996 --> 23:54.955
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.478
Now I understand

23:56.522 --> 23:57.958
why you've written
this new version of the play.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.525
You don't want Romeo
and Juliet's story to end.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.004
- Exactly!

24:01.048 --> 24:04.878
I love the characters,
so why say good-bye?

24:04.921 --> 24:06.706
- Well, if you truly
love the characters,

24:06.749 --> 24:08.838
don't they deserve
a great ending?

24:13.408 --> 24:17.325
- I have always known
how to finish their story.

24:17.368 --> 24:21.198
If I let them go,
I'm unsure what happens next.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.029
- I understand, but...

24:26.073 --> 24:28.641
endings are necessary
for growth.

24:28.684 --> 24:32.819
No matter how...
painful they may be.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.562
- You speak quite wisely.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.260
- I'm speaking from experience.

24:39.303 --> 24:43.307
I find myself
in a similar situation.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.179
When I'm done here,

24:45.222 --> 24:48.182
I am leaving my team
for a new adventure,

24:48.225 --> 24:50.837
and ending our journey

24:50.880 --> 24:55.319
has proven more heartbreaking
than I can bear.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.061
And while I can't imagine
saying good-bye,

24:58.105 --> 25:00.803
I know that I must.

25:00.847 --> 25:03.545
- Very well.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.592
I shall do what is needed
for my beloved characters.

25:06.635 --> 25:10.421
Give Romeo and Juliet
an ending no one will forget.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.994
- All righty.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.735
If we did our job right,

25:19.779 --> 25:22.782
this cover should change back
to "Romeo and Juliet"

25:22.825 --> 25:24.566
any second.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.569
- I know you're leaving, Ray.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.963
- Yeah, uh, to my honeymoon.

25:30.006 --> 25:32.487
- Oh, would you just
knock it off?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.533
I know you're leaving
the team.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.973
- Nate, I'm sorry.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.410
I was gonna tell you sooner,
I swear,

25:42.453 --> 25:44.891
but I just--
I didn't know how to do it.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.632
- Maybe if you had the balls
to say it sooner,

25:46.675 --> 25:48.416
maybe I could've done
something like

25:48.459 --> 25:52.115
make us a last mission playlist
or get us matching t-shirts.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.422
- That would've been amazing.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.903
But I was waiting
for some perfect moment

25:56.946 --> 25:58.600
which doesn't exist,

25:58.644 --> 26:01.472
because
I didn't want to upset you.

26:01.516 --> 26:04.214
- Of course I'm upset!
Today could've been awesome.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.739
It could've been amazing,
but now it's just...

26:08.349 --> 26:10.220
It's just over.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.353
- Eventually,

26:12.396 --> 26:14.137
everything has to change.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.661
- Yeah, I know everything
changes eventually.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.227
I didn't think it'd be so soon,

26:17.271 --> 26:18.446
and I didn't think
I'd be the last one to know.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.274
- Attention Legends,

26:20.317 --> 26:22.624
there is no record of the play
"Romeo and Juliet"

26:22.668 --> 26:24.539
in the timeline,
which means--

26:24.583 --> 26:26.454
- Shakespeare didn't
put on the play yet.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.761
The final mission
isn't completed.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.807
We can still go back
and fix history together!

26:34.070 --> 26:35.855
- The team has it, Ray.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.160
You should go.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.814
You're right.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.600
Things change eventually,
so why not start now?

26:41.643 --> 26:43.253
- Nate.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.995
Nate!

26:52.219 --> 26:55.091
- Billy Shakes,
what's happening?

26:55.135 --> 26:57.311
- Spare me your whimsical
turns of phrase.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.921
Barkeep!

26:58.965 --> 27:01.097
My draught has gone hollow.
I'll have another.

27:01.141 --> 27:04.057
- Will, what happened
to the play?

27:04.100 --> 27:07.103
- Henslowe withdrew the monies
and shut us down.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.845
In his mind's eye, he thinks
I stole back his ring.

27:09.889 --> 27:13.196
Now I have no theater,
no actors,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.024
and so, no career.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.809
- Well, tell us
where Henslowe is.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.159
We'll help you.
- Just leave me be.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.683
I've seen your help in action,
and it is anything but.

27:21.727 --> 27:22.989
- So you're just gonna
give up?

27:23.032 --> 27:25.121
- It's like the tall one said,

27:25.165 --> 27:26.775
all things must cease.

27:26.819 --> 27:30.257
And this is the end
of William Shakespeare.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.696
- He is so dramatic.
- Yeah.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.533
- Whoa.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.101
Packed already?
- Yeah.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.103
I figured, why wait?

27:50.146 --> 27:51.626
- Well, there's no rush.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.716
You know we can stick around
until they get back.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.631
- I think we've stuck around
too long already.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.343
- What is going on?

28:13.387 --> 28:15.171
- Well, we ruined
the Western literary canon,

28:15.215 --> 28:16.607
and Shakespeare hates us,

28:16.651 --> 28:18.827
so here's to
Legends of Tomorrow,

28:18.871 --> 28:22.788
who singlehandedly destroyed
storytelling as we know it.

28:22.831 --> 28:25.138
- Sorry, so that's it?

28:25.181 --> 28:27.009
- First you pick a fight
with Ray,

28:27.053 --> 28:28.837
and now you admit defeat?

28:28.881 --> 28:30.317
Are you just trying to prove

28:30.360 --> 28:31.753
that everything's as miserable
as how you feel?

28:31.797 --> 28:34.103
- I don't wanna talk about Ray.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.410
- Look, Nate, I get it.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.934
I'm afraid of losing Ray too.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.457
Honestly, I don't know
what we're gonna do

28:40.501 --> 28:44.070
without his stupid optimism
and blind faith

28:44.113 --> 28:47.377
and ridiculous plans
that somehow always work.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.990
I know what we need to do.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.689
Gideon, tell the team

28:54.733 --> 28:57.083
it's all hands on deck
here at the tavern.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.694
And fabricate some codpieces.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.522
The show must go on.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.051
- All right,
it's almost showtime.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.271
Remember, Gideon is going to be
feeding you your lines.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.142
- Yeah, no pressure,
it's not like we're rebooting

29:13.186 --> 29:14.796
Shakespeare's career
or anything.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.016
- It really is book club's
greatest mission yet.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.192
- I can't believe I let you
guys rope me into this one.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.497
- Look, if you wanna find
the Loom,

29:20.541 --> 29:22.108
you gotta do
things our way.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.631
- You this is gonna work,
Captain?

29:23.674 --> 29:26.721
- Honestly, no,
but Ray would.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.637
- "My bounty is as boundless
as the sea."

29:29.680 --> 29:31.552
That's crap!
- Just say the words

29:31.595 --> 29:33.597
because you are on!

29:41.997 --> 29:45.044
Listen up,
you uncultured jerks.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.483
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

29:49.526 --> 29:52.225
in fair Verona,
where we lay our scene.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.749
- Words, words.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.403
- Where civil blood...
- Words, words--

29:56.446 --> 29:57.926
t-those are my words!

29:57.970 --> 30:01.103
- A pair of star struck lovers
take their life.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.149
- Just enjoy the show,
all right?

30:03.192 --> 30:05.368
Looks like the audience is.

30:13.420 --> 30:17.728
- Clubs, bills, and partisans.

30:17.772 --> 30:21.558
Strike!
Beat them down!

30:21.602 --> 30:23.430
Down with the Capulets!

30:23.473 --> 30:25.780
Down with the Montagues!

30:28.130 --> 30:30.741
- What noise is this?

30:30.785 --> 30:33.527
- Give me my long sword, ho!

30:33.570 --> 30:36.095
- A sword?
A crutch.

30:36.138 --> 30:39.533
Why call you for a sword?

30:39.576 --> 30:41.578
- My sword, I say!

30:41.622 --> 30:43.406
Old Montague has come,

30:43.450 --> 30:46.409
and flourishes his blade
in spite of me.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.238
- Thou villain Capulet!

30:49.282 --> 30:51.414
- Hold me not,
let me go.

30:51.458 --> 30:55.027
- Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.125
- Fight.

31:10.172 --> 31:11.695
- Exciting.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.051
- What shall I swear by?

31:19.094 --> 31:23.011
If my heart's dear love--
- Do not swear.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.187
Although I take joy in thee,

31:25.231 --> 31:26.928
I take no joy
of this contract tonight.

31:26.972 --> 31:30.236
It's too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.849
Too rash, too unadvised,

31:34.893 --> 31:35.850
too sudden.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.990
Too like the lightning,

31:45.033 --> 31:46.948
which doth cease to be.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.211
Ere one could say
it lightens.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.693
Sweet, good night.

31:54.651 --> 31:59.787
- O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

31:59.830 --> 32:02.181
- What's wrong?

32:02.224 --> 32:03.660
I mean, other than the fact
that this role

32:03.704 --> 32:05.749
clearly should've gone
to a woman.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.795
- I just need a second, okay?

32:07.838 --> 32:10.493
Acting is hard.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.191
- I know it can be hard to face

32:12.234 --> 32:14.410
that your time with someone
is coming to an end.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.414
- Sometimes it's easier
to just send them away

32:18.458 --> 32:21.374
before it hits you,
like Juliet's doing here.

32:21.417 --> 32:22.810
- She got all that?

32:22.853 --> 32:24.855
- She was meant for book club.

32:24.899 --> 32:28.903
- Change is hard,
but it can also be beautiful.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.252
It can be both.

32:32.167 --> 32:35.388
You know, it's not too late
to say good-bye to your friend.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.000
- What about Juliet?

32:39.044 --> 32:41.002
- I have it handled.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.050
Among my many talents,

32:45.093 --> 32:47.139
I'm a classically trained
actor.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.140
- Huh.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.886
- Gidget, I'm off book.

33:00.108 --> 33:03.982
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

33:04.025 --> 33:07.724
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.900
- Is that a man?

33:09.944 --> 33:12.164
- Good night.
- Does it matter?

33:12.207 --> 33:13.556
- Good night.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.603
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

33:16.646 --> 33:19.954
as that within my breast.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.131
- O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

33:25.960 --> 33:27.701
- All right, Gideon,

33:27.744 --> 33:29.616
it's time for me to go.

33:29.659 --> 33:31.792
- Will I ever see you again?

33:31.835 --> 33:34.186
- I hope so.

33:34.229 --> 33:35.709
Thank you for everything.

33:35.752 --> 33:39.887
And, uh, take care
of the Legends for me.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.324
- Safe travels, Dr. Palmer.

33:46.589 --> 33:49.070
- Ray, are you there?
Can you hear me?

33:49.114 --> 33:50.941
Ray!

33:50.985 --> 33:54.249
- You.
Again.

34:12.006 --> 34:13.964
Ray!

34:14.008 --> 34:17.098
- What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

34:17.142 --> 34:21.668
- The exchange of thy love's
faithful vows for mine.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.887
- I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.802
And yet I would
it were to give again.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.153
- Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

34:29.763 --> 34:32.200
- But to be frank
and give it thee again.

34:34.507 --> 34:37.423
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have.

34:41.122 --> 34:44.386
- My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.910
My love as deep.

34:46.954 --> 34:50.697
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

34:50.740 --> 34:53.003
for both are infinite.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.708
I hear some noise within.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.014
Dear love, Adieu.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.975
- Ray!
Ray, Ray.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.723
I missed him.

35:16.766 --> 35:19.160
He's gone.

35:19.204 --> 35:22.468
- Nate.
Nate, I'm still here, buddy.

35:22.511 --> 35:27.560
- Psst.
Romeo, Romeo.

35:27.603 --> 35:30.389
- Ray, I am so sorry
I lashed out at you.

35:30.432 --> 35:31.868
It was just a lot to process,

35:31.912 --> 35:34.219
and I didn't know
how to say it.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.395
The thing is,
I'm just really sad.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.573
But I'm really happy
for you guys.

35:43.967 --> 35:47.971
- I'm sorry that you found out
the way you did.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.148
And I just--
I wish there was some way

35:50.191 --> 35:52.759
that everything and nothing

35:52.802 --> 35:54.717
could change all at once.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.735
- This sucks.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.521
But I love you.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.788
- This totally sucks.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.790
But I love you too.

36:27.054 --> 36:30.144
- Good night. Good night.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.146
Parting is such sweet sorrow,

36:32.190 --> 36:35.323
that I shall say "good night"
till it be morrow.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.393
- Zari was pretty good
at Juliet.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.265
I mean, not as good as you,
but...

37:10.315 --> 37:11.838
You okay?

37:11.881 --> 37:14.536
- It's a weird thing
with friendship.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.017
Starts because
you need each other,

37:17.060 --> 37:19.193
and then if you do it right

37:19.237 --> 37:21.021
and help each other grow,

37:21.064 --> 37:23.415
you need each other less.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.460
I guess change
is the whole point.

37:25.504 --> 37:29.638
- Well, if you, um,
you ever need a bro hug...

37:29.682 --> 37:32.250
I'm your gal.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.296
Bring it in.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.259
- Sorry.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.043
- It's okay.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.611
Ray was terrible at bro hugs
at first too.

37:45.654 --> 37:48.483
- Yeah.
- But you're really terrible.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.529
- Such a dick.
- Aww.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.095
Why are you so strong?

37:55.316 --> 37:56.926
- On a Shakespeare kick?

37:56.970 --> 38:00.060
- Didn't care much for those
Italian kids, but this guy--

38:00.103 --> 38:01.844
this guy's a hero.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.760
- You know King Lear
is a tragic figure

38:04.804 --> 38:06.849
who's stubbornness
and fear of the future

38:06.893 --> 38:08.503
leads to his own misery?

38:08.547 --> 38:10.549
- Sounds like someone
I can get behind.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.246
- You should talk
to your daughter.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.249
There's no secrets
in book club.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.862
- I'm not hiding from her.

38:19.906 --> 38:22.430
I'm protecting her.
- From what?

38:28.654 --> 38:31.483
- Nurturing fathers
don't run in my family.

38:31.526 --> 38:34.964
- But I'm better off
because I had you in my life.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.575
She will be too.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.362
It's good to see you.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.495
- Consent to hug you?

38:43.538 --> 38:46.759
- Gonna take that as a yes.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.812
- So this is part
of the Loom of Fate?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.074
- Well,
I had to disguise the bit

38:58.118 --> 38:59.554
so that mere mortals like you

38:59.598 --> 39:01.426
wouldn't burst into flames
when you looked at it.

39:01.469 --> 39:05.299
- Well, that is certainly very
thoughtful of you, Charlie.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.953
- Not so fast.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.563
This is too powerful, John,

39:08.607 --> 39:10.957
and honestly,
you're too close to it.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.872
- This is my mission, Sara.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.917
- And this is my ship.

39:14.961 --> 39:17.529
So what's the plan?
- This is just the beginning.

39:17.572 --> 39:21.402
But with that,
we can find the other pieces.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.796
- Mm-hmm.
Hmm...

39:29.323 --> 39:31.586
- Oh, I was so worried.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.806
I wasn't sure
when you'd wake up.

39:33.849 --> 39:36.330
What did you see?

39:36.374 --> 39:39.420
- I-I was in a bar.

39:39.464 --> 39:44.599
And people were laughing, and--

39:44.643 --> 39:46.949
and John was there
with his friends.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.212
- Did he say
what he was looking for?

39:51.519 --> 39:53.956
- He's looking for
the Loom of Fate.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.569
- The Loom?

39:57.612 --> 40:00.441
- Oh, so you've heard of it?
- Of course.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.269
The Loom of Fate

40:02.312 --> 40:05.185
is one of the most powerful
tools in existence.

40:05.228 --> 40:09.363
It could completely rewrite
your life.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.409
Are you sure you want to
trust that power

40:11.452 --> 40:13.585
in someone else's hands?

40:13.628 --> 40:16.588
Especially John Constantine's?

40:25.335 --> 40:29.514
Can't sleep either, huh?
- Yeah.

40:29.557 --> 40:32.081
You know, we all spend time
off the ship,

40:32.125 --> 40:34.867
but people usually
don't feel this, uh...

40:34.910 --> 40:36.782
both: Gone.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.218
- How early
does a guy have to get up

40:38.261 --> 40:39.915
to get some alone time?

40:39.959 --> 40:41.439
- Ray's green juice.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.615
You feeling sentimental,
too, huh, Mick?

40:43.658 --> 40:46.400
- The juice was taking up
all the room in the fridge.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.706
Now shut up, pretty.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.447
- Missing someone
after they're gone

40:49.490 --> 40:51.274
almost makes them more present.

40:51.318 --> 40:53.842
- Heard you get up, babe.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.844
I was awake anyway.
- Hi, babe.

40:55.888 --> 40:58.238
- I had a feeling
other people would be up.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.283
- Oh, gross.
Is that Ray's green juice?

41:00.327 --> 41:02.547
- Yep.
- Give me some.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.298
- To Ray,

41:15.342 --> 41:17.562
who taught me how
to be a better friend

41:17.605 --> 41:19.259
by being a better friend
than I deserved.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.043
- He told me that

41:21.087 --> 41:22.871
if you're dumb enough
to expect good from the world,

41:22.915 --> 41:25.613
the world might just live up
to your expectations.

41:25.657 --> 41:28.964
- And who showed us that
there's never a problem so big

41:29.008 --> 41:32.577
it can't be solved
with a smile.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.708
- To the big guy.

41:33.752 --> 41:34.709
- To Ray.
- To Ray.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.102
- To Ray.

41:36.145 --> 41:37.886
- I'm really gonna miss him.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.283
- Tastes like death.
- It's delicious.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.375
- Do you think Ray left that
bathroom sign-up sheet?

41:51.900 --> 41:53.554
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

42:15.968 --> 42:17.535
- Greg, move your head.
