01:06.568 --> 01:07.535
Thank you.

01:28.823 --> 01:31.348
All right, everybody, that's it for the day.

01:32.294 --> 01:35.730
Be sure you get that drop cloth up
before you leave, all right?

02:07.228 --> 02:11.324
- That's some nice work, young blood.
- Thank you, Mr. Roulette.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.959
Yeah, your daddy taught you right.

02:15.837 --> 02:18.533
You know, when all the construction
starts coming back...

02:18.640 --> 02:20.801
you got skills
to make something of yourself.

02:20.909 --> 02:22.570
Thank you, sir.

02:26.181 --> 02:28.172
That's fine. I can wait until payday.

02:28.283 --> 02:31.582
I'm sorry, all the others
have families to feed...

02:32.187 --> 02:33.882
but you do good work.

02:34.456 --> 02:37.482
- I like what you do, okay?
- Okay.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.629
You got a funny way of telling me that.

02:50.405 --> 02:51.997
Morning.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.672
- Didn't I tell you I could pull some strings?
- Yes, you did, Charlie.

02:56.778 --> 02:58.575
- Thank you, you're a good man.
- Yeah.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.342
But tell me why.... Morning.

03:02.584 --> 03:05.075
Why would a doctor
want to hire a carpenter?

03:05.520 --> 03:08.182
Because it ain't nothing
but scud work anyway.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.823
You ain't gonna like it.

03:11.226 --> 03:13.854
- You say the pay is $12 a week?
- Yeah.

03:15.697 --> 03:18.359
- I'm liking it already.
- All right, then.

03:22.604 --> 03:25.072
Dr. Blalock, this is Vivien Thomas.

03:26.174 --> 03:28.335
Vivien? That's a girl's name.

03:29.711 --> 03:33.704
Yes, my mother was so sure
she was having a girl...

03:33.815 --> 03:36.375
that she picked the name early, and kept it.

03:37.118 --> 03:38.346
You don't say.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.754
I'm pleased to meet you, sir.

03:41.856 --> 03:45.189
Call me Doctor, and, Francis,
you can tell this good doctor...

03:45.293 --> 03:48.694
that his theories are extremely interesting,
and I'll be praying for him.

03:48.797 --> 03:49.855
Yes, Doctor.

03:49.964 --> 03:52.865
Though it's his patients
I should be praying for.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.696
Keep up, son.

03:58.006 --> 04:02.500
- This is where my work is done.
- What is your work?

04:06.414 --> 04:08.006
Medical research.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.251
We push the limits of surgery...

04:11.352 --> 04:13.718
using stray dogs
we get from the local dog catch.

04:13.822 --> 04:16.552
They're darling, but don't get too attached.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.420
They're a means to a great end.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.096
The dog pens get cleaned up twice a day.

04:24.199 --> 04:26.064
I need the lab swept every morning.

04:26.167 --> 04:30.194
Simple tasks, but they proved
beyond the abilities of your predecessors.

04:30.405 --> 04:32.703
Do you think you can handle it?

05:05.206 --> 05:08.607
- So?
- So what?

05:09.811 --> 05:12.245
Don't "so what" me. Did you get it?

05:16.017 --> 05:19.418
You got it. You must have got it.

05:24.626 --> 05:26.753
- It's working at a hospital, right?
- Yeah.

05:26.861 --> 05:29.887
I'm so glad.
Everyone's gonna see how smart you are.

05:29.998 --> 05:33.058
I don't know
how smart you have to be to shovel.

05:33.234 --> 05:37.364
The guy I'm working for,
he seemed kind of eccentric...

05:37.639 --> 05:39.300
but he is a doctor, yeah.

05:39.474 --> 05:42.841
That's right, he is a doctor.
So you just keep your eyes open.

05:43.878 --> 05:46.711
- We can get married now.
- Yeah.

05:47.982 --> 05:50.314
Do everything just like we laid it out.

05:50.652 --> 05:51.914
Doctor...

05:53.388 --> 05:55.253
and Mrs. Thomas.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.732
- Vivien.
- Good morning, sir.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.505
- You said you were a carpenter?
- Yes.

07:28.182 --> 07:32.050
- Did you go to high school?
- Yes, I did. Got my diploma.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.413
Planning on going to Tennessee State
next year...

07:37.058 --> 07:38.821
to study medicine, be a doctor.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.224
Unusual ambition for a carpenter.

07:41.329 --> 07:44.298
I always wanted to be one since I was a kid.

07:45.333 --> 07:48.894
I almost saved up enough money
for college...

07:49.003 --> 07:51.062
and then slowdown hit.

07:51.339 --> 07:53.807
Those are Van Slyke
gas manometers over there.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.341
So you can handle a saw?

07:55.443 --> 07:58.901
- Yeah, since I was 12.
- Do tell.

07:59.347 --> 08:02.680
For cutting the lines, my father
would measure on the lumber, sir.

08:02.784 --> 08:05.412
Call me Doctor.
So your daddy's a carpenter, too?

08:05.520 --> 08:10.355
- What does he think of your ambition?
- He's always known I had my mind set on it.

08:11.025 --> 08:14.051
Those apparatus on the workbench,
what are they called?

08:14.696 --> 08:18.496
Van Slyke gas manometers, sir, Doctor.

08:21.135 --> 08:22.568
They are, indeed.

08:26.974 --> 08:31.274
Vanderbilt may be a Podunk institution,
but I'm gonna put it on the medical map.

08:32.714 --> 08:34.875
I'm working on traumatic shock.

08:35.216 --> 08:38.049
Damn thing kills thousands of people
every year...

08:38.152 --> 08:41.519
and doctors don't know
what the hell to do about it.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.681
Let me see those hands.

09:01.743 --> 09:03.108
Pick that up.

09:11.185 --> 09:12.618
Now the left hand.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.062
Good.

09:43.484 --> 09:46.510
Excuse me, Vivien.
Dr. Blalock wanted you to have this.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.322
- Thank you.
- Good night.

10:30.832 --> 10:32.265
You know what my grandfather did?

10:32.366 --> 10:35.062
It doesn't have anything to do
with me going out on strike.

10:35.169 --> 10:37.865
I said, "Do you know
what my grandfather did?"

10:37.972 --> 10:39.132
Yes.

10:39.774 --> 10:43.107
He picked cotton in Mississippi,
you told me a hundred times.

10:43.211 --> 10:46.078
My grandfather was a piece of property.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.409
No better than that chair or table over there.

10:51.419 --> 10:54.513
His son became a free man at the age of 15.

10:54.622 --> 10:58.353
He raised me
with hardly an elementary school education.

10:58.459 --> 11:02.327
Now I see my son graduate college
and go on to teach school.

11:02.430 --> 11:05.797
So don't tell me
things don't get better over time.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.561
Things don't just get better.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.432
People got to change things, Pop,
make them better.

11:10.538 --> 11:12.699
If I don't do something now,
I'll be a dead man...

11:12.807 --> 11:14.775
before I get paid like white teachers do.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.140
Vivien, you know I'm right about this.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.903
All right, now, Harold, just hold your head.
I got reading to do.

11:22.617 --> 11:26.246
To anesthetize Brutus,
first we have to calculate the weight.

11:26.354 --> 11:28.686
He weighs 18.4 kilograms.

11:29.156 --> 11:34.025
And it should take
552 milligrams of sodium barbital...

11:34.262 --> 11:39.131
to anesthetize him for three hours
if the absorption rate is uniform.

11:40.201 --> 11:41.235
Dogs? What kind of doctor is he?

11:41.235 --> 11:42.259
Dogs? What kind of doctor is he?

11:42.670 --> 11:45.969
When you practice on dogs,
and then you can help heal people.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.473
- Gives me the willies.
- It's not that bad.

11:50.912 --> 11:53.403
I mean, you look inside,
you see all the colors...

11:53.514 --> 11:57.075
all the pinks and blues, reds.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.551
It's beautiful, Clara.
That's where life comes from.

12:00.788 --> 12:01.722
What's this?

12:01.722 --> 12:02.051
What's this?

12:03.057 --> 12:04.024
Open up.

12:05.626 --> 12:09.392
Excuse me, sir. What's going on here?

12:09.630 --> 12:11.029
The bank is closed.

12:11.432 --> 12:13.024
- Closed?
- Yup.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.593
Open up.

12:17.438 --> 12:20.737
- Open this door!
- Somebody got to see somebody in there.

12:20.841 --> 12:25.073
Open up, it's 10:00. I got to get to work.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.340
Let's go, Vivien, we'll come back later.

12:27.448 --> 12:30.212
No, Clara, something's wrong.
It can't be closed.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.447
Excuse me.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.146
Excuse me, sir. Hello.

12:39.894 --> 12:41.862
Get away from that window, we're closed.

12:41.963 --> 12:43.794
But I have my money in there.

12:43.898 --> 12:47.197
- I need to get my money out.
- I can't get your money back for you.

12:47.435 --> 12:51.496
- Why not? Tell me why not.
- Go on home, son. The bank has failed.

12:52.106 --> 12:55.200
Sir, that's all my savings.

12:55.309 --> 12:58.745
I had my money for school in there.
They got my money in there.

12:58.946 --> 13:02.245
- Sir, that's my money for college.
- Your money's gone.

13:02.350 --> 13:03.749
Gone?

13:04.185 --> 13:08.519
- But what are they talking about?
- They talking about, it's gone, Ma.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.216
We'll all just have to start over.

13:11.826 --> 13:15.523
- Can't fight it now, it's done.
- It just feels so wrong.

13:17.365 --> 13:19.629
Took me seven years to save that money.

13:19.734 --> 13:22.202
You're not the only one
who had money in that bank.

13:22.303 --> 13:23.964
It's done, it's over with!

13:26.040 --> 13:27.735
We still got each other, Viv.

13:27.842 --> 13:29.571
Yeah, we got each other.

13:31.412 --> 13:34.108
That's all poor people ever have
is each other.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.357
There's no cut down the cannula,
the femoral vein.

13:54.468 --> 13:55.901
I showed you how to do it.

13:56.003 --> 14:00.633
I figured out a way
to give it barbital intravenously.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.842
- Where you putting it?
- In the forepaw.

14:06.147 --> 14:07.671
The manometer.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.913
It's all set up, Doctor.

14:14.622 --> 14:15.850
Good.

14:18.926 --> 14:22.327
- You can begin the incision.
- I'm not ready for that.

14:22.430 --> 14:24.625
I say you're ready, you're ready.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.468
I'll mark out the line. And you cut along it.

14:32.907 --> 14:35.137
Just like you did for your old daddy.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.307
Like this?

14:43.651 --> 14:46.085
Just like that. Keep your hand taut.

14:47.288 --> 14:49.586
Why are we making the incision here?

14:51.192 --> 14:56.061
- To gain access to the pulmonary artery.
- And how will we find it, Vivien?

14:56.397 --> 15:00.390
It's the artery leading to the lungs
from the right side of the heart.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.495
Not bad.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.229
Now the rib spreader.

15:10.945 --> 15:14.938
And why are we gonna damage
poor Brutus' greater vessels?

15:15.316 --> 15:17.944
To induce traumatic shock, to study it.

15:23.691 --> 15:25.989
Watch this manometer.

15:27.495 --> 15:31.295
And imagine that Brutus
is a 16-year-old boy...

15:31.398 --> 15:33.992
just fell out of a tree saving his mom's cat.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.598
He's broken four ribs, he's concussed.

15:40.074 --> 15:41.905
Dad's rushed him to ER.

15:42.009 --> 15:45.035
But he's gone into shock.
His blood pressure's way down.

15:45.146 --> 15:47.239
His vital signs almost nonexistent.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.875
Can we save him?

15:52.753 --> 15:55.119
Not if I use present methods of treatment.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.385
See, conventional wisdom says
I should constrict the vessels.

15:58.492 --> 16:02.292
I beg to differ. Let's break their rules.

16:02.696 --> 16:03.856
Use my rules.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.761
Body needs blood.

16:09.537 --> 16:11.300
Let's give it some.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.479
How's that gauge?

16:26.520 --> 16:27.953
Still falling.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.226
Maybe the experts are right.
Maybe I'm wrong.

16:37.831 --> 16:42.063
Maybe I'll kill this boy
and break his mother's heart.

16:45.940 --> 16:47.305
It's rising.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.108
That's life coming back.

16:53.781 --> 16:57.012
- How's that make you feel?
- Good.

16:59.887 --> 17:01.445
Very good, Doctor.

17:02.890 --> 17:05.290
Let's look at the record of our work.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.262
- Where's the smoke drum?
- I'm sorry?

17:16.136 --> 17:19.070
The smoke drums.

17:20.874 --> 17:25.003
- You didn't set the smoke drums?
- What is a smoke drum?

17:27.815 --> 17:31.979
That's a smoke drum.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

17:32.152 --> 17:35.918
I record all the information
I need for my research on a smoke drum.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.590
I did not know that.

17:38.692 --> 17:41.786
Is nobody listening to me?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.057
God damn it!

17:47.968 --> 17:50.835
I have to do everything myself.

17:51.272 --> 17:54.901
A whole day's work goes down the toilet,
and I have to start all over again.

17:55.009 --> 17:58.308
Do you have sawdust
or just plain shit for brains?

18:04.018 --> 18:06.453
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Fine, get out of here.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.011
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Fine, get out of here.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.981
Vivien. Jesus.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.649
- Hold on a minute, will you?
- I was not raised to take that type of talk.

18:47.761 --> 18:51.060
My apologies. I'm sorry I lost my temper.

18:51.165 --> 18:55.625
Normally it takes assistants months to learn
what you picked up in a matter of days.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.403
It won't happen again.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.942
Please.

20:05.739 --> 20:09.937
Ladies and gentlemen.
Fellows, take the music down, will you?

20:11.879 --> 20:13.870
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.049
I mentioned to Gen. Cunningham
the other day...

20:17.151 --> 20:20.609
how proud we were that Al had chosen us...

20:20.721 --> 20:23.019
over all the medical schools in the country.

20:23.123 --> 20:25.717
John, why don't you tell everyone
what you said?

20:25.826 --> 20:27.225
Be glad to, Walter.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.459
I just got back from a month at the front.

20:32.533 --> 20:35.661
There are thousands of our boys
in field hospitals...

20:35.769 --> 20:37.862
all over North Africa and Italy...

20:38.238 --> 20:41.969
who owe their lives to Dr. Blalock's work
in the treatment of shock.

20:43.076 --> 20:47.137
I want everyone here to know
how grateful we are to him...

20:47.648 --> 20:49.707
and how proud you all should be.

20:49.817 --> 20:51.648
Hear, hear.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.520
- Dr. Blalock, welcome.
- Thank you.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.351
Thanks, General.
It's great to have you here, Al...

20:57.458 --> 21:01.019
but truth be told, it's Mary we really want.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.655
Our new Chairman
of the Department of Surgery...

21:05.766 --> 21:09.429
my old and dear friend, Dr. Alfred Blalock.

21:12.873 --> 21:14.500
Thank you, Walter.

21:16.944 --> 21:20.243
Mary and I welcome you all to our home.

21:23.250 --> 21:26.219
As do our dear children.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.153
- Sadie, get them to bed, now.
- No!

21:33.794 --> 21:37.890
Thank you, Johns Hopkins,
for my prodigal return...

21:37.998 --> 21:40.660
after 15 years in the Tennessee backwoods.

21:41.535 --> 21:43.628
To find myself back here.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.128
Dreams do come true.

21:47.875 --> 21:51.811
You're the best surgeons in the country
and I'm honored to lead you.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.640
To use a timely reference:

21:56.149 --> 21:59.084
"We'll storm the beaches together.
Shoulder to shoulder."

21:59.186 --> 22:01.746
Lay siege to the mysteries of medicine.

22:01.855 --> 22:05.916
We'll make the kind of progress
Hopkins used to be known for.

22:06.026 --> 22:09.621
I know we will accomplish
great things together.

22:25.579 --> 22:29.606
I'm looking
for my next watershed discovery...

22:29.716 --> 22:32.116
not to put too modest a point on it.

22:32.219 --> 22:34.847
It's not enough for us to be great surgeons.

22:34.955 --> 22:38.686
We need to be outstanding researchers.
Any ideas? Anything innovative?

22:38.859 --> 22:41.919
What about skin grafts?
Testing what skin grips might take.

22:42.029 --> 22:45.192
- Isn't skin merely packaging?
- No, it keeps out infection.

22:45.299 --> 22:47.426
Excuse me, Doctor,
may I suggest something?

22:47.534 --> 22:50.298
Please do. I'm very suggestible.
Tell us your name again.

22:50.404 --> 22:54.773
- I run the Harriet Lane Clinic for children.
- Dr. Taussig. Yes, of course.

22:54.975 --> 22:59.002
Dr. Longmire, Dr. Kelven, Dr. Cooley.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.841
I've read about your research.

23:00.948 --> 23:02.973
- On congenitally malformed hearts.
- Yes.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.812
Boy, women and their hearts.

23:04.918 --> 23:07.853
Vivien, would you get Dr. Taussig a drink?

23:07.955 --> 23:10.617
- What would you like?
- Champagne would be lovely.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.420
Let's lubricate the vein of inspiration.

23:13.927 --> 23:15.986
Go on, Dr.Taussig tell us more.

23:16.096 --> 23:20.533
It's something that up to now
has been written off as untreatable.

23:20.634 --> 23:24.570
But I don't believe it has to be.
I'm speaking of Tetralogy of Fallot.

23:24.771 --> 23:25.863
Blue babies.

23:25.973 --> 23:28.407
Yes, these children,
their hearts aren't failing...

23:28.508 --> 23:32.239
they're suffocating due to a blockage
in the main artery to the lung.

23:32.346 --> 23:34.177
Pulmonary stenosis.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.879
The mortality rate is 100%.

23:38.986 --> 23:41.546
I've watched
hundreds of cyanotic children die.

23:41.655 --> 23:44.215
I admitted a baby tonight
who will certainly die...

23:44.324 --> 23:46.815
simply because
no one has had the courage...

23:47.227 --> 23:49.661
to attempt a surgical solution to this.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.492
Maybe with good reason.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.897
To put it mildly, you can't operate
on the heart. That's basic.

23:55.068 --> 23:57.866
- We don't have clinical proof of that--
- My point exactly.

23:57.971 --> 24:00.872
- It's possible for us--
- Denton, you have to stop the heart...

24:00.974 --> 24:03.499
to perform a complicated correction
within three minutes.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.010
By that time, they're dead.
These children are doomed.

24:06.113 --> 24:09.650
There must be a way
to get more blood to the lungs.

24:09.883 --> 24:13.011
I mean, I doubt we could
repair a defect in the heart walls--

24:13.120 --> 24:15.213
Without causing ventricular fibrillation.

24:15.322 --> 24:19.918
But maybe there's a way to avoid interfering
with the greater circulation....

24:20.027 --> 24:22.188
If we focus on the pulmonary artery.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.154
Who on this God's earth are you?

24:53.093 --> 24:56.290
- Brought home some food from the party.
- I'm trying to get her down.

24:56.396 --> 24:57.624
Hold on.

24:58.932 --> 25:02.197
Okay, girl. Now go to sleep, baby.

25:08.442 --> 25:10.535
The girls are just getting to bed?

25:10.644 --> 25:13.807
2-ton neighbor upstairs
nearly burst through the boards.

25:14.748 --> 25:17.945
- I'm gonna have to fix that.
- Are you gonna fix the fat man?

25:18.051 --> 25:21.817
Get him to stop hollering his head off,
when the girls is trying to sleep?

25:22.823 --> 25:25.587
Try a deviled egg. They're real good.

25:26.093 --> 25:27.822
Seen better in Nashville.

25:30.731 --> 25:32.323
I want to go home, Viv.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.492
Clara, it's our first week.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.400
Yeah, and you said
if we didn't like it, remember?

25:40.741 --> 25:43.471
- Yes.
- Our family's in Nashville.

25:43.910 --> 25:47.607
We had a nice home in a
good neighborhood. The schools were fine.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.181
Not living in this....

25:49.282 --> 25:52.945
I don't know how we're gonna make it
on that paycheck he's talking about...

25:53.053 --> 25:56.750
and he got you serving drinks at his party
just to make ends meet. Come on.

25:56.857 --> 25:59.325
Try to understand.
When I started at Vanderbilt...

25:59.426 --> 26:00.620
- I was a janitor.
- I know.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.992
Dr. Blalock saw what I could contribute,
and he gave me a chance.

26:04.097 --> 26:06.622
And when they offered him
that big job in Detroit...

26:06.733 --> 26:09.327
he didn't take it because they didn't take me.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.001
Now I'm a lab assistant to a top surgeon...

26:12.105 --> 26:14.801
at the number one medical school
in the country.

26:14.908 --> 26:17.809
- It's a good position.
- What about you going to medical school?

26:17.911 --> 26:20.778
You don't have to remind me of that.
We have a family now.

26:29.823 --> 26:31.620
Sweetheart, it's important work.

26:32.092 --> 26:36.188
And it's a real opportunity,
and I love what I'm doing.

26:38.565 --> 26:40.999
So it doesn't really matter
how I feel, then, does it?

26:41.101 --> 26:43.001
Clara, you know it matters.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.918
See that man?

27:00.987 --> 27:04.115
That's Johns Hopkins himself.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.526
Sir William Osler...

27:11.331 --> 27:13.891
the father of modern American medicine.

27:15.769 --> 27:19.102
William Halstead, invented the mastectomy.

27:21.341 --> 27:23.468
Let me show you some of the others.

27:29.716 --> 27:34.244
Excuse me.
All workers punch in at the rear entrance.

27:35.856 --> 27:38.825
- He's with me.
- That don't make any difference.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.791
- Do you know who I am?
- No, sir.

27:44.264 --> 27:47.131
Dr. Blalock, Chief Surgical Professor.

27:47.567 --> 27:50.092
I'm sorry, Dr. Blalock, but that's the rules.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.266
I'll meet you in the labs, Vivien.

28:10.724 --> 28:13.215
Hey, you need to punch in first.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.059
Thank you.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.680
I can see we've arrived.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.709
When was the last time
they used this place?

29:11.818 --> 29:14.548
Have someone clean it up
before they put the equipment in.

29:14.654 --> 29:16.986
I'll meet you in an hour
at the Harriet Lane wards.

29:17.090 --> 29:20.491
Let's see if there's anything
in this idea of Dr. Taussig's.

29:50.757 --> 29:52.520
Excuse me?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.827
Good morning.

29:55.061 --> 29:58.622
Where do you think I could find someone
to help us clean up the lab, Doctor?

29:58.732 --> 30:02.896
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I'm not sure.

30:03.203 --> 30:06.973
I'm Vivien Thomas,
I work for Dr. Blalock, running this lab.

30:07.107 --> 30:09.507
I'm Dr. Edgar V. Hecker...

30:11.411 --> 30:15.211
Director of Laboratories.
I'd like some coffee and a doughnut.

30:17.617 --> 30:19.676
Doctor.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.481
There must be a mix-up.

30:26.760 --> 30:30.890
Listen, I don't stand for insolence.
We'll see about this.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.227
- You know, Doctor, there aren't many--
- What?

30:38.338 --> 30:41.034
You'll have to speak up,
I can't hear too well in this ear.

30:41.141 --> 30:43.974
You're one of the few women doctors
I've seen here.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.573
At least they let me in
through the front door.

30:49.616 --> 30:52.244
This is where we keep
some of the older kids.

30:58.625 --> 31:02.026
Doctor, why do they squat like that?

31:02.996 --> 31:05.988
A little boy told me
that it helps him breathe better.

31:06.666 --> 31:10.102
It cuts off the blood to the legs,
pushes it up into the lungs.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.699
They both look very cyanotic.

31:16.009 --> 31:17.340
Here he is now.

31:19.512 --> 31:21.639
- Dr. Blalock. Welcome.
- Helen, sorry.

31:22.348 --> 31:25.749
Here is the Saxon baby
I was telling you about last night.

31:28.121 --> 31:29.418
Thank you.

31:45.438 --> 31:48.066
She usually smiles
when someone does that.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.641
Hello, Mrs. Saxon.

31:53.146 --> 31:56.309
- What is that thing?
- It's an oximeter.

31:56.416 --> 31:59.544
Reads how much oxygen
there is in the blood.

32:02.055 --> 32:05.821
She looks cold in there. But I can't hold her.

32:06.493 --> 32:10.088
They say it isn't good for her.
I'm not even supposed to let her cry.

32:10.196 --> 32:13.962
How do you keep a baby from crying?
Especially if you can't hold her.

32:17.137 --> 32:20.163
You can see the change
in the shape and the size of the vessels...

32:20.273 --> 32:22.070
as these hearts grow larger.

32:22.842 --> 32:26.209
I did necroscopies
on some of my patients' hearts.

32:26.479 --> 32:28.413
To study the malformations in detail.

32:28.515 --> 32:31.484
It's amazing they could live at all
with hearts like these.

32:31.584 --> 32:34.314
Dr. Gross at Harvard
said only God could correct...

32:34.420 --> 32:37.685
a narrowing indentation
of the left side of the aortic arch.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.226
Perhaps that statement says
more about Harvard than it does about God.

32:41.327 --> 32:45.127
That baby back there, how long?

32:46.166 --> 32:49.135
Six months. A year at the very most.

32:49.235 --> 32:52.602
- That's not right.
- Are you going to take this on, Doctor?

32:57.577 --> 33:00.546
I want to see all your diagnostic notes.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.879
I'll get them right away.

33:06.886 --> 33:08.251
Thank you.

33:22.769 --> 33:24.999
Put away the books, Vivien.

33:25.905 --> 33:28.874
Let's not waste any more time
on theoretical crap.

33:28.975 --> 33:31.102
Let's start with experiments.

33:32.212 --> 33:35.648
Four separate defects of the heart
working in combination.

33:38.284 --> 33:41.742
The pulmonary artery is constricted...

33:42.488 --> 33:47.016
in the main artery before the divide,
diminishing blood supply to both lungs.

33:48.528 --> 33:50.826
And the hole in the septum...

33:50.930 --> 33:55.333
causes the used blood
to flow back into the arterial system...

33:56.069 --> 34:00.267
instead of flowing through the lungs,
turning the babies blue.

34:02.275 --> 34:04.539
A baby's heart is delicate.

34:06.346 --> 34:08.837
It's a goddamn minefield.

34:10.483 --> 34:15.045
The first step is to see if we can create
the "blue baby" condition in a dog...

34:15.154 --> 34:17.588
and then come up with a plan to solve it.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.855
You're drinking too much coffee.

34:22.962 --> 34:26.261
Balzac drank 300 cups of coffee in one day.

34:28.501 --> 34:32.027
Of course, he died of a perforated ulcer.

34:35.475 --> 34:38.501
Odds are against us
reproducing this in the laboratory.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.876
Are you sure this is the limb
you want to climb out on?

34:43.949 --> 34:47.043
Back in '29, when I had TB...

34:50.422 --> 34:54.917
the x-rays showed a big gaping hole
in my left lung.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.821
I laid there on a freezing porch...

34:59.198 --> 35:02.167
in a sanatorium in upstate New York...

35:02.735 --> 35:05.067
with 18 blankets on me.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.662
Nothing but my nose
exposed to the elements.

35:10.510 --> 35:14.742
Death's a very humbling thing to live with
day in and day out.

35:17.450 --> 35:18.712
I swore then...

35:20.386 --> 35:24.254
if I got my life back,
I would do something important with it.

35:27.493 --> 35:32.157
I know, in every fiber of my being...

35:33.232 --> 35:36.099
that this is a limb I want to climb out on.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.535
It's gonna be hell
trying to work with a child's vessels...

35:41.641 --> 35:43.609
three or four millimeters thick.

35:43.710 --> 35:46.406
Like sewing over cooked spaghetti noodles.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.580
We'll need the smallest sutures.

35:50.950 --> 35:53.009
We'll need to make our own tools.

35:53.753 --> 35:57.245
- We could be in for trouble, Vivien.
- Big trouble.

35:59.125 --> 36:03.323
- Dr. Alfred Blalock to OR, please.
- They're driving me crazy.

36:04.464 --> 36:06.659
This goddamn war.

36:06.766 --> 36:08.334
We don't have enough doctors.
My surgery cases are through the roof.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.700
We don't have enough doctors.
My surgery cases are through the roof.

36:10.803 --> 36:12.896
If I'm not operating, I'm teaching.

36:13.906 --> 36:16.500
You're gonna have to do
most of this research.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.399
What'll you need?

36:20.346 --> 36:24.578
I need a bulldog clamp
small enough for the baby...

36:25.218 --> 36:27.448
but strong enough
to stop the flow of blood.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.453
What about a breathing device?

36:29.856 --> 36:34.225
I'd love a Positive Pressure Respirator,
but with this war going on....

36:34.427 --> 36:38.887
Yeah, how in hell can I do the experiments
if I can't even get the equipment?

36:40.533 --> 36:41.500
Shut up.

36:43.102 --> 36:45.662
You surely pissed off Ed Hecker.

36:45.772 --> 36:48.639
You mean I disturbed his afternoon nap?

36:49.075 --> 36:53.603
What is it with you
and that boy of yours? Thomas.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.813
Why'd you bring him up here?

36:55.915 --> 36:58.509
We've been together more than 12 years.

36:59.118 --> 37:03.521
He's a really good worker.

37:08.194 --> 37:09.889
How about a little wager?

37:14.667 --> 37:15.656
$50?

37:18.404 --> 37:21.464
- Give him a break, Dick.
- You're on.

37:22.742 --> 37:25.973
There's a rumor going around
you're contemplating heart surgery.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.740
That's an intriguing rumor, don't you think?

37:28.848 --> 37:32.750
Wouldn't it be a feather in our cap
if we were the first ones to do it?

37:32.852 --> 37:36.185
Indeed, it would.
But I hope you'll forgive my skepticism.

37:36.289 --> 37:39.019
There is no reason for us
to think it's possible.

37:39.125 --> 37:42.891
And every indicator says it can't be done.

37:43.396 --> 37:46.160
Most of us agree, Al, the risks are huge.

37:46.599 --> 37:49.397
There isn't even any incremental progress.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.742
Where you see risks, I see opportunity.

38:06.052 --> 38:08.247
You gotta take care of that sink up in 4-B.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.219
You said you were gonna fix these steps.

38:10.323 --> 38:13.850
Yes, forgive me, I've been very busy at work.
But I will get to it.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.225
The deal is $7 off for odd jobs every month.

38:17.530 --> 38:19.293
You gotta pick up the pace.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.820
With allied forces fighting at Cassino...

38:42.922 --> 38:47.518
German Field Marshal Kesselring
has earned a reputation as one of our few....

38:47.860 --> 38:51.352
This is good, sweetheart.
It's got some kick to it tonight.

38:51.931 --> 38:55.560
The same as last night.
Just put it on a different side of the plate.

38:55.668 --> 38:57.761
Sometimes it's better the next day.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.638
I hope so, 'cause guess what?

39:02.508 --> 39:04.373
Tomorrow it's hash a la king.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.435
It's hash a la queen tonight.

39:16.589 --> 39:18.216
I could get a job.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.160
Who'll look after the girls?

39:34.974 --> 39:37.067
I know it's not Nashville.

39:39.946 --> 39:41.413
And I know...

39:42.481 --> 39:45.348
I wouldn't be able to do
what I'm doing without you.

39:46.619 --> 39:49.383
My father took care of us,
I'll take care of you.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.823
And everything's gonna be just fine.
We'll be just fine here.

39:54.961 --> 39:58.260
I know, you're right. We'll be fine here.

40:02.301 --> 40:04.929
We're gonna run out of dogs
at this rate, Vivien.

40:05.037 --> 40:07.972
It's been three months,
and all I'm closer to is retirement.

40:08.074 --> 40:12.033
Things move slow sometimes.
No matter what you want.

40:13.312 --> 40:13.779
I'm getting close. I've got 30% desaturation.

40:13.779 --> 40:17.715
I'm getting close. I've got 30% desaturation.

40:17.817 --> 40:19.444
That dog was faintly blue at best.

40:19.552 --> 40:22.953
Until we get the dog in the same state
as the baby, we can't go forward.

40:23.055 --> 40:27.014
- What is the problem?
- Every time I constrict, it kills the dogs.

40:27.360 --> 40:31.626
I've tried nylon, ligature,
umbilical tape, ox facet.

40:32.565 --> 40:34.157
We need a new approach.

40:35.668 --> 40:38.034
Okay, forget constriction.

40:38.371 --> 40:42.273
Try a partial lobectomy.
Remove both lobes of the right lung.

40:42.842 --> 40:46.869
Do an arteries to veins fistula,
where the medial wall of the aorta...

40:46.979 --> 40:48.970
and the pulmonary artery adhere.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.211
I'll be in the OR.

40:56.689 --> 40:59.522
That's a very good idea, Doctor. Thank you.

41:03.329 --> 41:05.388
- God damn it!
- You did the best you could.

41:05.498 --> 41:07.989
With the condition of his liver,
you never had a chance.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.034
I always have a chance.

41:10.703 --> 41:12.864
- Get me his autopsy.
- Yes.

41:18.477 --> 41:19.466
Shit.

41:20.546 --> 41:21.740
Damn.

41:26.285 --> 41:28.776
- What's that?
- Our new respirator.

41:29.288 --> 41:31.552
I was rummaging around the machine shop.

41:31.657 --> 41:35.058
It's not pretty, but it works.

41:37.329 --> 41:39.388
It is pretty.

41:42.635 --> 41:46.435
I knew I could count on you.
You're the only one I can trust around here.

41:46.539 --> 41:49.667
I suspect others relish the thought
of seeing me fail.

42:02.488 --> 42:03.853
Mary!

42:12.498 --> 42:14.567
- There's an ambulance in the driveway.
- Good evening.

42:14.567 --> 42:15.431
- There's an ambulance in the driveway.
- Good evening.

42:17.369 --> 42:21.328
Gen. Cunningham needed help
carting wounded Gl's off the ship.

42:21.941 --> 42:24.535
So I volunteered to be a driver on the base.

42:28.781 --> 42:31.249
- That's wonderful.
- Not really.

42:32.218 --> 42:34.118
I've a lot of time on my hands.

42:34.754 --> 42:36.346
She wouldn't go to bed?

42:37.389 --> 42:39.220
Not until you came home.

42:42.461 --> 42:44.326
You know what she said today?

42:45.264 --> 42:48.256
She said she wanted to be a patient
when she grows up.

42:49.068 --> 42:51.434
So she can get to see her daddy.

42:59.178 --> 43:02.739
I don't remember you wearing a tool belt
at your coming-out party.

43:06.185 --> 43:08.050
Guess it has been...

43:08.154 --> 43:10.588
a couple of weeks
since I made it home before 11:00.

43:10.689 --> 43:13.089
No, it's 23 days.

43:14.894 --> 43:18.091
Not as if I don't know
the lot of a doctor's wife...

43:19.532 --> 43:20.760
but I miss you.

43:26.338 --> 43:27.805
It's gonna change.

43:29.208 --> 43:31.108
It's probably gonna get worse.

43:35.981 --> 43:38.814
- Vivien.
- Dr. Longmire.

43:38.918 --> 43:41.648
- Is Dr. Blalock in?
- No, he's not.

43:41.754 --> 43:44.917
I don't know where he is.
You should check his office.

44:00.639 --> 44:04.370
That's an interesting procedure.
Never seen a clamp like that before.

44:04.610 --> 44:08.068
- It is for small vascular work.
- Where'd you get it?

44:08.547 --> 44:11.539
I pieced it together
from some things lying around.

44:12.952 --> 44:15.318
Now we're getting somewhere.

44:23.162 --> 44:24.789
You're not even looking.

44:26.098 --> 44:29.465
It's like when you come home
late at night, you know?

44:30.135 --> 44:32.933
You know the feel of the room in the dark.

44:35.941 --> 44:37.408
That looks impossible.

44:37.509 --> 44:39.670
No, if I can do it, you can do it.

44:40.679 --> 44:44.171
You see, this string here...

44:44.316 --> 44:47.285
that's how you get traction on the suture...

44:47.386 --> 44:51.083
'cause you need a lot of exposure
for the anastomosis.

44:54.927 --> 44:57.088
I'd like to work with you sometime.

44:58.864 --> 45:00.923
Fine, Dr. Longmire, that'd be fine.

45:01.033 --> 45:05.402
My emergency rotation starts in 10 minutes,
but I can come in on Thursday.

45:05.838 --> 45:08.329
That'd be fine. You have a good day, Doctor.

45:48.814 --> 45:52.409
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood.

45:52.952 --> 45:54.920
Supreme Court, finally made it.

45:55.921 --> 45:59.584
A long time. You been working
on this case for what, nine years?

45:59.792 --> 46:02.488
- No, 12 years.
- 12 years?

46:03.462 --> 46:04.656
Time.

46:05.364 --> 46:08.060
So, tell me, what was it like?

46:09.401 --> 46:12.802
Nine white guys in big gowns
walked in first.

46:12.905 --> 46:14.805
Then the school board lawyers.

46:14.907 --> 46:19.071
Our lawyer, Thurgood Marshall,
he looked kind of lonely in there.

46:19.845 --> 46:22.245
You know what them people
said in their brief?

46:22.348 --> 46:25.715
Said since colored teachers in Nashville
live so cheaply...

46:25.818 --> 46:29.049
they should pay us
a whole lot less than white teachers.

46:29.989 --> 46:31.684
But let me tell you...

46:31.790 --> 46:34.759
Thurgood said he'd be goddamned
if they could get away with that.

46:34.860 --> 46:38.819
So he gets up and says to that white lawyer,
"You're full of it.

46:39.865 --> 46:42.527
"Have you ever read the Constitution?

46:42.634 --> 46:45.899
"The damned 14th Amendment.
The equal protection clause says:

46:46.071 --> 46:49.734
"'A government can't discriminate
based on race."'

46:50.476 --> 46:53.741
Yes, Lord. I mean he was good, Viv.

46:54.413 --> 46:57.109
I think we got the Board of Education
on the run.

46:57.216 --> 47:00.515
That's good news, Harold.
So when will they decide?

47:00.652 --> 47:02.620
Could be months, longer.

47:02.821 --> 47:05.688
I don't know, but I can wait.
After all these years.

47:05.791 --> 47:08.123
All those calls I got
in the middle of the night.

47:08.227 --> 47:11.719
White folk telling me they gonna kill me
if I don't drop this lawsuit.

47:11.830 --> 47:14.822
No, you gotta show them
you won't take that treatment.

47:15.067 --> 47:18.696
Wait. Listen to me when I tell you,
you need to leave this sorry-ass place...

47:18.804 --> 47:20.203
and that dead-end job.

47:20.305 --> 47:23.240
Harold, Dr. Blalock's
doing the best he can for me.

47:23.342 --> 47:24.809
It's not enough.

47:24.910 --> 47:29.540
He trusts me to carry out those experiments
on my own. I'm running the whole lab.

47:29.648 --> 47:32.276
- Thank you.
- But does he compensate you extra for that?

47:32.384 --> 47:34.944
Now, Harold, Vivien's doing
important research now.

47:35.054 --> 47:37.045
But he's forgetting
what Granddaddy told us.

47:37.156 --> 47:40.125
He said he regretted
acting so grateful for being free...

47:40.225 --> 47:42.591
for what really wasn't any freedom at all.

47:42.694 --> 47:44.161
I know, I remember.

47:53.872 --> 47:56.773
What you giving him extra for?
What's wrong with me?

47:56.875 --> 47:59.639
Nothing minding your own business
wouldn't cure.

48:04.016 --> 48:05.677
You got that white coat.

48:06.552 --> 48:09.221
But you're just a class three worker,
same as me.

48:09.221 --> 48:09.312
But you're just a class three worker,
same as me.

48:09.855 --> 48:13.188
In fact, I got two years' seniority on you.

48:13.759 --> 48:15.454
I'm making more than you.

48:15.861 --> 48:18.329
Don't think you're
some kind of big shot around here.

48:18.430 --> 48:21.729
Excuse me, buddy.
Class three, what does that mean?

48:22.167 --> 48:24.158
It means salary grade.

48:24.636 --> 48:27.662
And, ma'am, and this here? What's this?

48:28.607 --> 48:30.097
Job classification.

48:30.909 --> 48:32.536
What is class three?

48:35.013 --> 48:36.742
Maintenance worker.

48:37.382 --> 48:39.816
I'm a lab technician. That can't be.

48:42.287 --> 48:43.584
"Vivien Thomas."

48:49.862 --> 48:51.420
Okay. Here we go.

48:51.530 --> 48:54.260
"Vivien Thomas, class three."

48:55.868 --> 48:57.301
Thank you.

49:06.945 --> 49:09.971
- How's it going?
- The vessel's tolerating ligation.

49:10.449 --> 49:11.780
Any progress?

49:14.086 --> 49:17.613
If you kill that dog,
I swear I will take it out of your paycheck.

49:22.294 --> 49:23.693
I'm finished up here.

49:23.795 --> 49:27.094
Dr. Longmire, would you mind
closing up for me? Thank you.

49:29.902 --> 49:31.665
Come on, Vivien.

49:54.826 --> 49:57.351
I was kidding
about taking it out of your paycheck.

49:57.462 --> 50:01.364
Good luck. 'Cause I only make $16 a week.

50:02.267 --> 50:05.498
- For a 16-hour day.
- That's all they can pay.

50:05.604 --> 50:08.471
That's all they can pay
class three workers around here.

50:08.574 --> 50:10.337
What are you talking about?

50:11.910 --> 50:14.879
That's my job classification.

50:17.115 --> 50:19.242
Who cares what they call you?

50:19.351 --> 50:22.582
You and I both know
how valuable the work is that you do.

50:22.688 --> 50:27.250
If my work is so important,
then why am I class three?

50:28.193 --> 50:31.321
Two grades below what I do.
In classification and pay.

50:31.430 --> 50:34.490
I don't know why.
I don't pay attention to bureaucratic details.

50:34.600 --> 50:35.624
I see.

50:35.834 --> 50:39.429
Look, at Hopkins you can't be a technician
without a college degree.

50:39.538 --> 50:42.507
- And where are you going?
- I need to fix some steps.

50:44.176 --> 50:45.905
We have work to do.

50:46.478 --> 50:50.175
Do I have your permission
to do some work for my landlord...

50:50.282 --> 50:51.749
so I can pay my rent?

50:57.089 --> 51:00.456
Dr. Blalock, could you come here, please?

51:04.429 --> 51:06.329
You're not gonna believe this.

51:07.232 --> 51:08.824
Look at the oximeter.

51:15.874 --> 51:18.809
The gums are blue, Doctor. Vivien did it.

51:25.284 --> 51:26.376
Off, Alfred.

51:29.588 --> 51:31.522
I brought him up here...

51:32.791 --> 51:34.486
I gave him this opportunity.

51:34.593 --> 51:38.359
I don't set the pay scale.
I just don't see what more I can do.

51:38.463 --> 51:40.431
You're probably feeling guilty.

51:41.433 --> 51:44.163
Guilty? What the hell
do I have to feel guilty about?

51:44.269 --> 51:45.861
For not sending him to college.

51:45.971 --> 51:48.132
You think I should have
sent Vivien to college?

51:48.240 --> 51:51.107
Sure, why not? Told me that was his dream.

51:51.343 --> 51:54.779
- Even mentioned it to me once.
- You know I need him in the lab.

51:57.783 --> 52:00.650
I guess there's only so much good
one person can do.

52:01.887 --> 52:03.787
Congratulations on the dog.

52:05.190 --> 52:08.990
The kind of raise you're suggesting,
how important is this?

52:09.961 --> 52:13.328
He makes it possible for me
to be in many places at the same time.

52:13.432 --> 52:15.798
Can't you just hire
a well-trained college kid--

52:15.901 --> 52:18.699
No, I can't. His hands are important to me.

52:18.804 --> 52:21.500
He's good at following my instructions,
improving on them...

52:21.606 --> 52:23.301
better than anyone I've encountered.

52:23.408 --> 52:26.343
You want me to circumvent
every administrative regulation...

52:26.445 --> 52:27.912
on behalf of a colored helper?

52:28.013 --> 52:30.777
Walter, I'm close
to accomplishing something.

52:30.882 --> 52:33.407
I need him with me
so I can continue with my research.

52:33.518 --> 52:35.486
Can I count on your help?

52:39.057 --> 52:40.490
Hello, Clara.

52:41.460 --> 52:42.984
Dr. Blalock.

52:46.064 --> 52:47.554
Come in, sir.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.131
Thank you.

52:53.705 --> 52:55.798
Is Vivien at home?

52:56.375 --> 52:58.605
Yes, he's putting the kids down.

53:06.318 --> 53:09.515
You know, in 13 years, Dr. Blalock...

53:09.621 --> 53:12.590
I don't recall
you ever stopping by our house.

53:13.258 --> 53:16.022
I don't recall ever being invited.

53:16.795 --> 53:18.092
Professor.

53:19.564 --> 53:20.758
Did something happen?

53:20.866 --> 53:23.699
Yes, I obtained a raise for you,
$25 extra a month...

53:23.802 --> 53:25.463
on top of what you're already making.

53:25.570 --> 53:28.300
That's $300 for the whole year.
Will that be sufficient?

53:28.407 --> 53:32.366
- What job classification?
- Surgical technician. I got you promoted.

53:32.611 --> 53:35.205
Promoted. To what he already does.

53:37.883 --> 53:39.214
Excuse me.

53:46.691 --> 53:49.524
You can pay your rent
and put all your focus on our research.

53:49.628 --> 53:53.086
Vivien, back there in the lab with Ponchos,
what did you do?

53:53.632 --> 53:56.260
What you suggested. A partial fistula.

53:56.835 --> 54:00.168
I stitched the main arteries
and veins together, end-to-end...

54:00.272 --> 54:01.773
and two lobes in the lungs.

54:01.773 --> 54:02.330
and two lobes in the lungs.

54:03.175 --> 54:06.042
We created a blue baby's heart in that dog.

54:10.382 --> 54:11.508
Did we?

54:11.616 --> 54:14.779
Now we have our disease model,
we can find a cure.

54:15.987 --> 54:18.046
And much as I enjoyed
coming here to see you...

54:18.156 --> 54:21.284
would you mind terribly
if I got you a telephone?

54:22.461 --> 54:24.486
No, not at all.

54:25.197 --> 54:26.494
Thank you.

54:32.337 --> 54:33.827
A shunt.

54:36.208 --> 54:38.608
I'm sorry, Doctor. What'd you say?

54:39.578 --> 54:43.708
We need to create a shunt
to get more oxygenated blood to the lungs.

54:47.452 --> 54:49.317
Can't see how to do it.

54:50.255 --> 54:54.851
Remember back in Vanderbilt
when we were doing the research...

54:55.293 --> 54:58.228
on how to create high blood pressure
in the lungs?

54:58.396 --> 55:02.560
Yes, I connected the subclavian
to the pulmonary artery.

55:03.702 --> 55:06.136
We failed to get the higher blood pressure...

55:06.238 --> 55:08.706
but we did get higher blood flow.

55:11.309 --> 55:15.575
Which is exactly
what Dr. Taussig said these babies need.

55:16.515 --> 55:19.416
That's it. We build a bypass.

55:20.685 --> 55:22.949
Take an artery and redirect it.

55:24.222 --> 55:29.125
- Systemic artery to the pulmonary artery.
- Through the lungs.

55:30.829 --> 55:33.889
It's a long way around, but it gets you there.

55:33.999 --> 55:37.594
If we wait from the right side,
we have an advantage there.

55:37.702 --> 55:41.433
But the recurrent nerve is in the way,
and if we kink that--

55:41.540 --> 55:44.441
- Vocal cords parallel.
- And the carotid's here.

55:44.543 --> 55:47.740
We may kill the brain if we damage that.

55:48.847 --> 55:50.542
Comforting thought.

55:55.220 --> 55:56.881
The subclavian....

55:58.456 --> 56:00.014
Tie it off.

56:02.494 --> 56:04.086
After the divide.

56:06.531 --> 56:10.262
Cut it right under the clavicle.

56:10.869 --> 56:12.496
Swing it down.

56:12.871 --> 56:15.431
Long, slow general arc.

56:15.540 --> 56:18.338
Will it hold if we pull it down four inches?

56:18.510 --> 56:21.001
If your hands don't get too excited.

56:21.313 --> 56:23.907
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

56:24.082 --> 56:26.983
No one's ever done anything as hard as this.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.417
Changing the course of blood.

56:29.521 --> 56:32.012
It'd turn blue into pink.

56:37.596 --> 56:39.860
And death into life.

57:01.853 --> 57:04.253
I don't care what the chart says.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.721
This girl wants to live.

57:23.174 --> 57:25.506
- Retractor.
- No, suture.

57:26.645 --> 57:29.375
Can't we try things my way occasionally?

57:30.615 --> 57:32.173
All right.

57:32.751 --> 57:33.979
Sutures.

57:38.356 --> 57:41.257
Do you mind
if I show you something, Doctor?

57:48.299 --> 57:49.630
Thank you.

57:58.376 --> 57:59.968
Do you need any help?

58:00.078 --> 58:02.171
No, that's fine. Thank you.

58:07.018 --> 58:10.112
I have to purse-string the anastomosis.

58:12.490 --> 58:15.584
Okay, there. He's all yours, Doctor.

58:20.965 --> 58:23.024
Do you feel the connection?

58:26.037 --> 58:28.528
Are you sure you did this, Vivien?

58:30.375 --> 58:32.935
This is like something the Lord made.

58:40.819 --> 58:43.014
Look, Mr. Saxon, Mrs. Saxon...

58:43.421 --> 58:46.720
I acknowledge
that these are uncharted waters.

58:46.825 --> 58:48.315
There are risks.

58:48.426 --> 58:53.056
But I think we have found a way
to repair your daughter's heart.

58:54.365 --> 58:55.593
How?

58:57.001 --> 59:00.630
You're stationed, where,
Norfolk, is it, Mr. Saxon?

59:00.739 --> 59:01.967
Yes, sir.

59:02.073 --> 59:05.236
Been working on the Spencer,
trying to get her back out to sea.

59:05.343 --> 59:07.675
You work on the engines, right?

59:07.779 --> 59:09.041
Yes, sir.

59:09.147 --> 59:12.241
I'd be changing around some of the piping...

59:12.350 --> 59:14.215
Ieading to and from your daughter's heart.

59:16.755 --> 59:19.815
- Just switching around the pipes?
- Yes.

59:20.492 --> 59:23.393
Arteries that bring the blood...

59:23.495 --> 59:25.326
to and from the heart to the lungs...

59:25.430 --> 59:26.920
act just like pipes.

59:27.232 --> 59:31.134
I've been successful,
switching them around.

59:33.037 --> 59:36.438
- It's that easy?
- No, it's not that easy.

59:37.108 --> 59:38.370
No surgery is...

59:38.476 --> 59:41.104
and this operation
has special complications.

59:41.212 --> 59:43.737
But I still think it's worth doing.

59:54.359 --> 59:56.884
We're going to talk about this, Doctor.

59:57.595 --> 59:58.926
Good idea.

01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:07.065
It's going to be a lot harder with a baby.

01:00:07.639 --> 01:00:10.665
We're going to have to collapse
one of her lungs.

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:14.137
She's already so cyanotic.

01:00:14.846 --> 01:00:16.905
She's not getting enough oxygen...

01:00:17.015 --> 01:00:20.746
and we're going to have to take away
half of her lung function.

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:24.716
You made those new clamps yet?

01:00:24.823 --> 01:00:26.313
I'm working on it.

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:29.519
What if I shred her insides
with those clamps?

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.891
So many ways to fail.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.560
Every second counts.

01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:36.727
A single minute is too long.

01:00:36.835 --> 01:00:40.566
A single minute
of poor blood flow to the brain...

01:00:40.672 --> 01:00:44.199
a single second of open bleeding....

01:00:46.411 --> 01:00:49.175
Are you saying
I shouldn't allow this doctor...

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.042
to perform a miracle to save my baby?

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.778
We don't get to demand miracles.

01:00:54.886 --> 01:00:57.548
Honey, God has his plans.

01:00:58.022 --> 01:00:59.819
Maybe we just have to accept it.

01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:03.325
But I was so happy
when I was pregnant with Eileen.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:08.929
You know, I haven't had enough time.
Why can't God let me get to know her first?

01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:12.531
I mean, I don't want to go against him.

01:01:13.171 --> 01:01:15.401
But why can't His plan be...

01:01:15.707 --> 01:01:18.141
to let this doctor save her life?

01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:21.772
Prof. Blalock.

01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:26.313
Mrs. Saxon told me
you plan to operate on her baby.

01:01:26.618 --> 01:01:29.610
- Have you seen this child, Doctor?
- I check on her every day.

01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:33.316
And you're still going to proceed?
Have you had any success in the lab?

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:37.758
Absolutely. I successfully performed
a shunt on a dog just two weeks ago.

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:42.060
I can't imagine you're going to proceed
based on the laboratory success on a dog.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:44.464
How many people have you saved?

01:01:46.337 --> 01:01:49.101
So what you're saying is
you're performing an experiment...

01:01:49.207 --> 01:01:50.265
not an operation?

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:54.243
My instincts tell me
nature made a mistake and I can fix it.

01:01:54.345 --> 01:01:57.610
Would you like to see
what I've been doing, Father?

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:12.830
Right now my instincts tell me
perhaps you should come back another day.

01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:17.463
What? Your quest for glory is vain, arrogant.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:21.004
It takes arrogance to cut someone
with a scalpel to save their life.

01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:25.098
I have no doubt.
But if you intervene with God's will...

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.402
violate the purity of an innocent heart...

01:02:28.513 --> 01:02:32.472
the parents, not you, Doctor,
will bear the burden of guilt.

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:36.178
Perhaps God is, as you say,
trying to kill this child.

01:02:36.888 --> 01:02:38.378
I am not.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.651
Look at this. The shunt gave out.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.889
Looks like a train wreck.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:53.234
What happened to you, Ponchos?

01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:56.540
- Maybe we should just stop here, Doctor.
- No.

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.871
We using the wrong vessel?

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:05.407
What the hell's going on?

01:03:15.293 --> 01:03:17.693
Viv, get up.

01:03:19.697 --> 01:03:21.665
Wake up. It's okay.

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:24.459
It's okay, baby.

01:03:27.138 --> 01:03:29.538
- It's just a nightmare.
- My God.

01:03:34.779 --> 01:03:37.646
Where the hell have you been, Vivien?

01:03:37.749 --> 01:03:41.708
I had a dream
about this white woman last night.

01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:44.778
Perhaps that's something
best kept to yourself.

01:03:44.889 --> 01:03:46.083
No.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:50.456
I knew it was Eileen Saxon.
She was all grown up.

01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:55.097
She was sitting there in a corner.
She was knitting...

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.332
and she let out a baby voice...

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.771
and she fell over dead. I couldn't see it...

01:04:01.873 --> 01:04:04.842
but I knew on the inside
she had a baby heart.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:09.242
- She just fell over dead.
- What the hell does that have to do with....

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:18.216
The stitches didn't grow.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:22.986
When we did the shunt on Ponchos,
he was 10 pounds. He went up to 20.

01:04:23.094 --> 01:04:26.188
- He pulled it loose.
- I was wrong. Purse-stringing doesn't work.

01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:29.596
We need a new stitching technique.

01:04:29.734 --> 01:04:32.464
Continuous on the back wall,
interrupted on the front wall.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.037
That's what we need.

01:04:34.806 --> 01:04:37.434
And then, the shunt will grow.

01:04:37.742 --> 01:04:41.678
65% oxygenation.
She's deteriorating so rapidly.

01:04:42.013 --> 01:04:45.574
- Have we got time to practice the operation?
- We can't let up.

01:04:45.683 --> 01:04:49.119
- What about the new stitching technique?
- We're trying it out tomorrow.

01:04:53.157 --> 01:04:54.146
You have to see this.

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:58.058
Vivien Thomas is operating,
assisted by the Chief of Surgery.

01:05:03.468 --> 01:05:06.437
Pull the inbound vein anastomosis.

01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:09.805
Long, slow, general arc.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:13.741
I can't see. Can you see, Vivien?
Could you adjust that lamp?

01:05:15.613 --> 01:05:17.808
Are the clamps still holding?

01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:20.540
- Yes.
- No kinking?

01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:21.777
None.

01:05:23.421 --> 01:05:25.821
All right, now for the tough part.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:28.915
Continuous sutures on the back wall...

01:05:30.495 --> 01:05:32.588
interrupted on the front.

01:05:45.176 --> 01:05:47.110
Removing bulldog clamp.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:51.514
Come on, girl.

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:53.641
Come on, please.

01:05:55.753 --> 01:05:58.017
That's it, a little bit more.

01:05:58.289 --> 01:06:01.053
I can feel the flow to the lungs.

01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:07.055
Helen, tell the Saxons we'll be operating.

01:06:07.165 --> 01:06:08.496
You bet.

01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:13.696
You'll be ready.

01:06:13.905 --> 01:06:17.705
Yes, now that I've seen the master at work.

01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:19.703
Master of the hounds.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.176
Your daddy should be proud of you.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.872
I think he is.

01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:28.048
Mine was only proud of the fact
that I could wiggle my ears.

01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:30.779
I think he'll be proud when you operate.

01:06:30.888 --> 01:06:32.446
He's dead.

01:06:33.891 --> 01:06:36.359
The dead are with us all the time, I believe.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.655
Can't separate the past from the future...

01:06:38.763 --> 01:06:41.755
any more than you can
your right arm from your left arm.

01:06:41.866 --> 01:06:45.165
But, you see, they are separated...

01:06:46.137 --> 01:06:48.071
by this, by the heart.

01:06:48.506 --> 01:06:50.030
Or connected.

01:06:52.643 --> 01:06:53.871
Or connected.

01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:06.185
Nolitangere; Do not touch.

01:07:07.158 --> 01:07:09.126
Do not touch the heart.

01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:14.730
We are gonna challenge
this ancient doctrinal myth...

01:07:15.366 --> 01:07:18.426
in this hospital. Who wants to attend?

01:07:22.607 --> 01:07:24.234
Dr. Swedlin?

01:07:26.077 --> 01:07:27.942
Dr. Philmore?

01:07:33.651 --> 01:07:35.312
Dr. Cooley.

01:07:37.555 --> 01:07:39.386
And Dr. Longmire.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:43.659
Thank you.

01:07:53.704 --> 01:07:56.104
You're dangling your reputation off a cliff.

01:07:56.207 --> 01:07:58.198
Calm down, Walter, this isn't grand opera.

01:07:58.309 --> 01:08:01.403
Isn't a doctor's first tenet: "Do no harm"?

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:03.876
What are you saying?

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.945
Postpone the operation
until you have more experience.

01:08:07.051 --> 01:08:09.315
Postponing means
signing that baby's death warrant.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.150
- I will not be the one to do that.
- But they'll ruin you.

01:08:12.256 --> 01:08:16.192
Walter, I'm operating tomorrow.

01:08:20.398 --> 01:08:22.332
You're rushing this...

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.363
because you don't want to admit
to those parents...

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.437
that you spoke too soon.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.895
You should come to bed.

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:54.687
I tried that.

01:08:57.835 --> 01:09:00.531
Can I give you a ride
to the hospital tomorrow?

01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:01.832
Thanks.

01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:07.073
I could use the lift.
I don't trust myself behind the wheel.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.371
Al, anybody would be nervous.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.371
It's not that.

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:19.389
I was just thinking
about a remark you made.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.850
You said I used to be wild...

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:24.823
not just ambitious.

01:09:28.032 --> 01:09:32.366
But I wonder if my ambition
hasn't driven me wild.

01:10:31.128 --> 01:10:33.221
Dr. Taussig, Professor.

01:10:34.832 --> 01:10:38.063
I just wanted to wish good luck to everyone.

01:10:38.736 --> 01:10:40.397
Thank you, Vivien.

01:10:40.571 --> 01:10:42.095
Thanks, Vivien.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:57.644
We're going to block
that baby's pulmonary artery for 30 minutes.

01:10:59.757 --> 01:11:04.626
As long as her blood pressure doesn't go
below 60, I think she should be fine.

01:11:04.929 --> 01:11:07.363
I don't think
she can survive much lower than that.

01:11:07.465 --> 01:11:10.832
- Isn't that right, Dr. Harmel?
- Not below 60. That's right, Doctor.

01:11:10.935 --> 01:11:13.199
Dr. Blalock, they're ready.

01:11:18.242 --> 01:11:19.641
Doctor.

01:11:27.215 --> 01:11:28.978
Coming in now.

01:11:53.775 --> 01:11:55.538
Dr. Longmire.

01:12:02.483 --> 01:12:04.451
What is going on?

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.195
They won't page him.

01:12:17.732 --> 01:12:20.667
- Why not?
- Something about hospital policy.

01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:25.866
Page Vivien Thomas immediately.

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.805
Dr. Blalock, what's wrong?
What's happened?

01:12:27.909 --> 01:12:30.469
It's all right.
I won't tell you again. Page him.

01:12:30.578 --> 01:12:34.514
- We're only allowed to page doctors.
- Give me that, goddamn you.

01:12:35.717 --> 01:12:38.880
Vivien Thomas, paging Vivien Thomas.

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:42.821
You're wanted in OR right now.
Come on the run, do you hear?

01:12:42.924 --> 01:12:44.721
This is Blalock.

01:12:45.493 --> 01:12:47.188
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:57.434
Jesus.

01:12:58.473 --> 01:13:00.373
About time. Scrub up.

01:13:00.475 --> 01:13:02.466
- Scrub up?
- You're coming in with me.

01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:05.239
Would you find Mr. Thomas
something to stand on?

01:13:05.346 --> 01:13:07.211
What for, Doctor?

01:13:07.315 --> 01:13:10.307
You're talking me through this.
Now scrub up.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.659
What's he doing here?

01:13:24.265 --> 01:13:27.200
- What the hell is that?
- I'll see about this.

01:13:28.836 --> 01:13:30.895
Should we say a prayer?

01:13:31.005 --> 01:13:33.565
Forget it. He won't listen to me.

01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:35.967
Dr. Blalock, a word.

01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:39.342
- You can resume your duties.
- These are his duties.

01:13:43.284 --> 01:13:45.514
- Can you see now?
- Yes, Doctor.

01:13:48.356 --> 01:13:50.847
Okay, I think we're ready to start.

01:13:53.294 --> 01:13:56.923
Okay, we're going in.

01:14:04.739 --> 01:14:07.799
It's going to be all right. It'll be just fine.

01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:10.940
She'll be all right.

01:14:13.614 --> 01:14:16.674
Incising the mediastinum pleura...

01:14:16.784 --> 01:14:19.617
from the main left pulmonary artery.

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:22.121
To the apex of the pleural space.

01:14:22.223 --> 01:14:25.215
I'm dissecting the pulmonary artery.

01:14:25.326 --> 01:14:27.453
Well back into the mediastinum.

01:14:27.562 --> 01:14:29.393
This all right, Vivien?

01:14:29.664 --> 01:14:31.256
That looks fine.

01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:34.767
The right angle clamp.

01:14:47.682 --> 01:14:49.775
Okay, I think it's holding.

01:14:49.884 --> 01:14:52.819
Are you able to deliver
to the left subclavian artery?

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.218
I believe so. Blood pressure?

01:14:55.323 --> 01:14:57.257
70, falling.

01:14:58.059 --> 01:15:00.220
Do not move that light.

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:06.565
And now...

01:15:08.603 --> 01:15:10.730
- I'm dividing the--
- Careful.

01:15:15.676 --> 01:15:18.167
- Clamp it.
- I can't reach it, Doctor.

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:22.841
I got it. Hemorrhage controlled.

01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:26.119
Can you see, Doctor?

01:15:26.754 --> 01:15:28.745
Not really. Nurse.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.095
For goodness sake,
can't you even see my ears?

01:15:41.202 --> 01:15:42.692
Sorry, Doctor.

01:15:44.572 --> 01:15:45.834
Suture.

01:15:58.519 --> 01:16:01.283
- Blood pressure is 68.
- Yes, go on.

01:16:01.656 --> 01:16:03.351
Watch the carotid.

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.319
Yes, traction on the suture.

01:16:06.427 --> 01:16:09.225
Okay, now the clamp Vivien made.

01:16:09.931 --> 01:16:12.456
- What clamp?
- The one just there.

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.228
Right there, yes.

01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:19.028
We're about to connect the shunt.

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:21.374
Blood pressure is 60.

01:16:22.677 --> 01:16:24.110
No, 59.

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:26.237
I know, I'm almost there.

01:16:34.822 --> 01:16:37.620
Now front, interrupted.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.452
That's good, Doctor. Just a little more now.

01:16:58.479 --> 01:17:00.640
Removing the bulldog clamp.

01:17:03.684 --> 01:17:07.484
- I see some bleeding right--
- I know, I see it, too. Suture.

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:19.124
- No, Doctor, the other way.
- Yes.

01:17:21.502 --> 01:17:23.402
Good, you got it now.

01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:28.706
Bleeding controlled.

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.974
I'm palpating the connection.

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:35.977
What do you feel?

01:17:41.422 --> 01:17:44.414
I can't tell
if blood is flowing through the shunt.

01:17:44.525 --> 01:17:47.085
It's just too small to feel anything.

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:50.096
Dr. Blalock, you have to see this.

01:18:03.978 --> 01:18:05.377
My God.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.318
Her blood pressure is rising.

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:18.886
Evacuate the blood in the chest cavity.

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:20.688
Put in the chest tube.

01:18:20.795 --> 01:18:23.730
Are we inflating the left lung with oxygen?

01:18:24.565 --> 01:18:26.294
Ready for closure.

01:18:38.913 --> 01:18:40.403
Who would have thought it possible?

01:18:40.514 --> 01:18:44.348
Heart surgery.
And we did it right here in Johns Hopkins.

01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:51.419
- Thank you, Dr. Blalock.
- Thank you so much.

01:19:01.869 --> 01:19:03.769
I knew you could do it.

01:19:06.173 --> 01:19:08.641
- Some operation.
- Amazing.

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:12.873
That child's chances were so slim.
Took a hell of a surgeon to pull her through.

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:15.608
He was lucky
to have that nigger in there with him.

01:19:15.716 --> 01:19:17.547
Thomas sure saved his ass.

01:19:18.486 --> 01:19:21.250
I'd like to see him try it without him.

01:19:30.898 --> 01:19:33.196
You did well in there, Vivien.

01:19:34.502 --> 01:19:35.935
Thank you.

01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:44.001
You performed an excellent surgery, Doctor.

01:19:44.145 --> 01:19:45.339
Yes.

01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:49.107
I think I did.

01:20:20.014 --> 01:20:24.678
Please, I understand. This is a hospital.
Can you please keep your voices down?

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.816
I can understand how you all must feel...

01:20:27.922 --> 01:20:31.380
but we have been overwhelmed
with children from all across the country...

01:20:31.492 --> 01:20:34.290
and then there's just one doctor
to perform these operations.

01:20:34.395 --> 01:20:36.920
So if you could just go
to the administration office...

01:20:37.031 --> 01:20:39.932
they'll accommodate all of you
into Dr. Blalock's schedule...

01:20:40.034 --> 01:20:41.296
as soon as possible.

01:20:41.402 --> 01:20:43.836
All right? I'm terribly sorry.

01:20:45.606 --> 01:20:49.042
Making the first incision.

01:20:54.248 --> 01:20:56.512
- Are you there, Vivien?
- Yes, I'm here.

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:01.788
Thank you for the opportunity to observe,
Dr. Blalock.

01:21:01.889 --> 01:21:04.517
- It's an honor, Doctor.
- Again, excellent work, gentlemen.

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:06.855
Thank you, Helen.
May I introduce my colleagues...

01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:11.762
Dr. Helen Taussig, Vivien Thomas.
This is Dr. Craford, from Stockholm...

01:21:11.866 --> 01:21:14.699
- and Dr. Petrovsky from Leningrad.
- Honored to meet you.

01:21:14.802 --> 01:21:19.171
You have given surgeons around the world
great courage with your deeds.

01:21:19.273 --> 01:21:24.006
Coming from such an eminent surgeon
as yourself, that is a compliment, indeed.

01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:26.677
It's been a great pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Taussig.

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:28.612
- Thank you.
- Dr. Thomas.

01:21:28.716 --> 01:21:31.207
Call me Mr. Thomas, or Vivien.

01:21:31.919 --> 01:21:33.682
You're not a doctor?

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:36.882
No, I just work here with Dr. Blalock.

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:40.093
Can we please have
all the doctors who participated...

01:21:40.194 --> 01:21:42.890
in the "blue baby" operation in this shot?

01:21:43.364 --> 01:21:47.960
There's a young woman who hitchhiked
from Appalachia with her son.

01:21:48.302 --> 01:21:52.033
And I think his blood levels
may be low enough to test.

01:21:52.406 --> 01:21:55.068
Talk to Dr. Taussig about scheduling him in.

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:59.169
If you'd all turn and face the center, please,
like Dr. Longmire.

01:22:00.314 --> 01:22:02.077
- Helen.
- Very good.

01:22:02.883 --> 01:22:06.080
Thank you,
now focus your attention here, please.

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.521
Smile, focus here. Hold that.

01:22:10.424 --> 01:22:14.019
Good. Now if we could have
one of you alone, Dr. Blalock.

01:22:19.266 --> 01:22:22.099
Very good, sir. Focus here, if you would.

01:22:22.369 --> 01:22:24.360
Here we go, Doctor.

01:22:27.174 --> 01:22:29.005
Thank you very much.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.750
They're nice pictures, aren't they?
They always have nice pictures.

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:48.261
Just 'cause you're not in the news
doesn't mean you weren't there, Viv.

01:22:56.637 --> 01:22:58.161
I'll be back.

01:23:34.808 --> 01:23:37.402
A man who is a real pioneer...

01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:40.969
a gambler who takes all the right risks...

01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:44.983
who's rescued untold lives
with his work in shock...

01:23:45.319 --> 01:23:49.449
and has gone on to challenge
the entire medical establishment...

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:52.287
to reconsider an age-old taboo...

01:23:53.327 --> 01:23:56.854
in performing the world's first heart surgery.

01:23:58.232 --> 01:24:01.861
Now, without embarrassing myself,
I'd like to introduce...

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:05.962
a man who has undeniably
brought a dash of pink...

01:24:06.106 --> 01:24:08.131
to the cheeks of others.

01:24:08.609 --> 01:24:10.839
Dr. Alfred Blalock.

01:24:38.305 --> 01:24:41.274
Thank you. I am indeed honored.

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:46.370
And while I am grateful...

01:24:47.214 --> 01:24:51.310
for the many gifts
that have been given to me in my life...

01:24:53.687 --> 01:24:57.316
perhaps the greatest gift
has been the support...

01:24:57.958 --> 01:25:00.722
of my colleagues over this last year.

01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:03.729
My good friend, Walter Dandy.

01:25:05.265 --> 01:25:09.827
The wonderful, brilliant colleagues
who assisted me in our operation;

01:25:11.505 --> 01:25:13.473
Dr. Helen Taussig...

01:25:13.574 --> 01:25:15.439
Dr. William Longmire...

01:25:15.976 --> 01:25:17.705
Dr. Denton Cooley...

01:25:17.811 --> 01:25:19.802
Dr. Mel Harmel.

01:25:20.514 --> 01:25:22.004
I believe...

01:25:22.683 --> 01:25:25.914
one group of people
could not have accomplished...

01:25:26.553 --> 01:25:31.286
so much in so little time
without a strong, unified effort...

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.393
in the spirit of breaking new ground...

01:25:37.498 --> 01:25:38.829
together.

01:25:40.434 --> 01:25:45.064
To further the reach of medicine
is one that should be cherished...

01:25:46.974 --> 01:25:48.965
and never allowed to die.

01:26:12.633 --> 01:26:14.533
What the hell is this?

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.898
I need to do something different.

01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:20.770
What about our work?

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:25.110
You got all of those other people
you were thanking.

01:26:25.779 --> 01:26:27.940
What are you talking about?

01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:31.879
Belvedere Hotel.

01:26:32.553 --> 01:26:35.488
The Belvedere is segregated.
You were there?

01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:39.821
Snuck in, just like a bellhop.

01:26:39.927 --> 01:26:42.987
Is that what this is about,
hobnobbing with the powers that be?

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:45.224
Vivien, they will never
let you into their club.

01:26:45.332 --> 01:26:48.824
It is naive to think otherwise.
Will you stand still?

01:26:50.771 --> 01:26:53.797
I'm not talking about them.
I'm not talking about Hopkins.

01:26:53.907 --> 01:26:55.841
I'm talking about you.

01:26:56.076 --> 01:26:57.202
Me?

01:26:59.246 --> 01:27:03.114
What have I ever done
except fight in your corner?

01:27:04.952 --> 01:27:07.887
I have taken you every step of the way
with me...

01:27:07.988 --> 01:27:11.355
and now you want to throw all that away?
For what?

01:27:12.392 --> 01:27:15.122
Is that any way to show your gratitude?

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:17.720
I don't know. You tell me, Doctor.

01:27:18.198 --> 01:27:22.066
Vivien, take pride in the fact
you have power in your mind...

01:27:22.169 --> 01:27:23.659
and in your heart.

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:26.604
- And in my hands.
- Exactly, in your hands.

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:32.570
We made history together.

01:27:34.114 --> 01:27:36.014
We changed the world.

01:27:41.922 --> 01:27:43.412
The world.

01:27:47.127 --> 01:27:49.288
I'm invisible to the world.

01:27:49.696 --> 01:27:52.358
I don't mind that. I understand that.

01:27:54.601 --> 01:27:57.195
I thought it was different in here.

01:28:12.386 --> 01:28:14.911
Mr. Thomas, I'm a little confused.

01:28:15.155 --> 01:28:17.783
Now you want college credit
for Morgan State...

01:28:19.059 --> 01:28:20.526
without actually taking classes?

01:28:20.627 --> 01:28:22.652
In certain courses, yes.

01:28:22.763 --> 01:28:25.732
I'll take the test. I'll take finals...

01:28:25.933 --> 01:28:29.562
Chemistry, Biochemistry, Science, Physics.

01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:32.571
Also, I can get the credit
for material I already know.

01:28:32.673 --> 01:28:35.870
I need to get through college
a little more quickly...

01:28:35.976 --> 01:28:38.274
so I can get on to med school.

01:28:38.378 --> 01:28:40.209
And so you actually participated...

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:42.874
in all this groundbreaking research,
Mr. Thomas?

01:28:42.983 --> 01:28:44.644
Yes, I did.

01:28:45.085 --> 01:28:48.816
I'm afraid it just doesn't work like that.

01:28:49.256 --> 01:28:51.622
You'll have to start with Freshman English.

01:28:51.725 --> 01:28:54.558
Social Science, maybe.

01:28:54.661 --> 01:28:57.425
I don't have time for that.

01:28:57.798 --> 01:28:59.857
I'm 35 years old.

01:29:03.136 --> 01:29:06.037
You're saying
that I have to start at the beginning?

01:29:07.507 --> 01:29:11.204
Yes, Mr. Thomas.
I'm afraid that is in fact what I'm saying.

01:29:11.311 --> 01:29:15.407
I thought this institution
provided opportunity for colored people?

01:29:16.116 --> 01:29:18.812
I have a wife, two young daughters, son.

01:29:18.919 --> 01:29:21.945
And I've been working in my field for over....

01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:26.550
Almost 15 years now.
I'm from Nashville, I came....

01:29:52.886 --> 01:29:54.877
And what can I do for you?

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:59.587
My name is Vivien Thomas.
I work for the Ralph Wintham company.

01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:04.221
We have a line of pharmaceuticals,
particularly antacids.

01:30:04.331 --> 01:30:07.095
We already have a supplier of antacids.

01:30:08.168 --> 01:30:13.037
Yes, well, these antacids
block against gastroesophageal reflux...

01:30:13.373 --> 01:30:16.672
- without any adverse side effect--
- Vivien Thomas.

01:30:17.911 --> 01:30:20.277
The fellow with the blue babies?

01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:24.742
A patient of mine who works at the hospital
told me about you.

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:29.048
Hopkins is doing well
because of what you did for them...

01:30:30.724 --> 01:30:32.419
and here you are.

01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:38.319
I don't have anything against the hospital.

01:30:39.833 --> 01:30:42.893
I'm just working in medicine
in a different way now.

01:30:47.007 --> 01:30:49.373
Let's see what other lines you have.

01:30:49.476 --> 01:30:52.445
Yes, we have effervescent powder here....

01:31:02.055 --> 01:31:04.990
Oh, William, look who's here?

01:31:05.759 --> 01:31:09.320
- Hello.
- Say hi to Grandma.

01:31:10.263 --> 01:31:12.925
My goodness.

01:31:14.401 --> 01:31:17.564
How you doing, sweetheart? Look at him.

01:31:22.809 --> 01:31:26.836
Stop running. Go up and wash your hands.
And you bring your little sister down.

01:31:26.947 --> 01:31:29.177
And be careful on them steps.

01:31:29.649 --> 01:31:31.378
What about construction?

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:34.283
I keep asking him. "Thomas and Thomas."

01:31:34.621 --> 01:31:36.851
With the building boom, we could clean up.

01:31:36.957 --> 01:31:39.391
Now, he know I can't saw a plank
worth a damn.

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:41.290
- Yeah, that's the truth.
- Yeah, Dad.

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:44.887
I did see that mailbox
leaning to the side a little bit.

01:31:45.198 --> 01:31:48.099
I don't understand
why you quit teaching in the first place.

01:31:48.201 --> 01:31:50.761
I never really liked the classroom
that much, Clara.

01:31:50.871 --> 01:31:51.997
Too many kids.

01:31:52.105 --> 01:31:54.801
But you fought all those years,
and you won the case, so--

01:31:54.908 --> 01:31:56.205
Exactly.

01:31:56.309 --> 01:32:00.109
And quitting now means
you've just wasted a whole lot of time.

01:32:00.213 --> 01:32:03.512
- No--
- I don't think it's a waste of time.

01:32:03.917 --> 01:32:06.442
If Harold wasn't down there
doing what he was doing...

01:32:06.553 --> 01:32:09.784
there'd still be a lot of colored teachers
down there getting cheated.

01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:12.051
I think they ought to
name a school after him.

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:14.252
Yeah. Harold Thomas High.

01:32:15.095 --> 01:32:16.562
- Harold Thomas High.
- Hear, hear.

01:32:16.663 --> 01:32:20.827
No, most of these young teachers,
they don't know anything about that strike.

01:32:20.934 --> 01:32:22.868
They take their equal paycheck for granted.

01:32:22.969 --> 01:32:24.266
Harold, you're full of excuses.

01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:27.238
There's no point
in waiting for the world to thank you.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:28.932
That bus ain't never going to come.

01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:31.704
- Amen to that.
- I'm not waiting, Pop.

01:32:31.978 --> 01:32:34.970
I'm just looking for something
that excites me as much as...

01:32:35.148 --> 01:32:37.241
hammering nails pleases you.

01:32:45.325 --> 01:32:47.885
Viv, Jeopardy is on.

01:32:48.428 --> 01:32:50.453
I'll be in in a minute.

01:32:53.066 --> 01:32:54.328
You okay?

01:32:55.702 --> 01:32:56.930
I'm fine.

01:32:57.771 --> 01:33:00.467
Stomach's bothering me a little bit,
but I'm fine.

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:04.704
Why don't you take those fancy antacid pills
that you always brag about?

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:09.543
It's your brother?

01:33:11.251 --> 01:33:15.017
I miss him. I miss the old Harold.

01:33:16.456 --> 01:33:18.390
Seems a little lost now.

01:33:18.658 --> 01:33:20.057
I miss you.

01:33:23.563 --> 01:33:25.758
Still got my mind in that lab.

01:33:27.267 --> 01:33:30.498
It's not just your mind, Viv.
It's your heart, too.

01:33:32.272 --> 01:33:35.139
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Clara.

01:33:35.408 --> 01:33:37.842
I think I've embarrassed myself enough.

01:33:38.545 --> 01:33:41.605
I can't go back in there
with my tail between my legs.

01:33:41.715 --> 01:33:44.343
It's where you belong, Vivien Thomas.

01:33:44.451 --> 01:33:47.978
So how you walk back on in there,
well, that's up to you.

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:53.550
Yes?

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.757
Doctor. Good morning.

01:34:12.479 --> 01:34:14.640
How was your trip to Europe?

01:34:16.983 --> 01:34:19.144
It was very gratifying...

01:34:19.252 --> 01:34:23.348
and how well it seems
to have stood on its feet...

01:34:23.723 --> 01:34:25.418
for this moment in time.

01:34:28.828 --> 01:34:31.126
What can I do for you, Vivien?

01:34:31.231 --> 01:34:33.062
I've made a mistake...

01:34:35.835 --> 01:34:38.463
and I would like my old position back.

01:34:39.639 --> 01:34:42.369
And how's it going to be any different?

01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:47.539
I'm still the same self-righteous bastard.

01:34:49.416 --> 01:34:51.247
It's not about you.

01:34:52.719 --> 01:34:54.584
It's about the work.

01:34:59.059 --> 01:35:00.720
I like the work.

01:36:04.958 --> 01:36:07.449
Mr. Thomas, we've got an animal
going into shock here.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.822
What do we do, sir?

01:36:08.928 --> 01:36:13.365
Did you try clamping off
the lateral part of the atrium?

01:36:13.466 --> 01:36:15.798
Yeah, hold it right there.

01:36:15.902 --> 01:36:18.462
- Careful.
- Okay.

01:36:21.074 --> 01:36:24.009
Yeah. You handled yourself
well there, Doctor.

01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:26.078
- That's good.
- Thank you.

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:31.008
It started--

01:36:31.384 --> 01:36:35.013
There was a message for you, Mr. Thomas.
Dr. Blalock wanted to see you.

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.789
I'm sorry. Would you....

01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:40.485
- Tell him I'll see him--
- He's about to leave for the day.

01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:44.194
Honey, I have to call you back. Okay.

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:54.401
How's your girls?

01:36:54.507 --> 01:36:59.035
They're fine. They're doing well.
Theo's in Morgan State now.

01:37:00.113 --> 01:37:02.946
- That must feel good.
- Yes.

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:07.377
How are things with you?

01:37:11.958 --> 01:37:16.486
I've had the unfortunate experience
of being put in the hands of a surgeon.

01:37:25.305 --> 01:37:27.865
You have something on your mind, Doctor?

01:37:27.974 --> 01:37:31.239
Yes, Columbia's been dangling
an offer to teach...

01:37:31.344 --> 01:37:33.278
but I wanted to talk to you first.

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.610
I really would like you to come with me.

01:37:35.715 --> 01:37:39.446
They know about your work.
You could write your own ticket.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.780
It's hard to imagine being there without you.

01:37:47.293 --> 01:37:49.955
I thank you for thinking of me, Doctor.

01:37:51.698 --> 01:37:53.893
I think I should stay here.

01:37:56.136 --> 01:38:00.596
We could do great things there.
Wouldn't it be fun to do it one more time?

01:38:00.807 --> 01:38:02.399
One more time.

01:38:05.945 --> 01:38:07.845
I like what I'm doing.

01:38:08.381 --> 01:38:12.249
Teaching, helping people along.
Working with the young doctors.

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:15.752
I like it here at Hopkins.

01:38:15.855 --> 01:38:20.383
Yeah, I guess you got your own things
going on here now.

01:38:21.294 --> 01:38:23.159
I recognize this man.

01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:27.993
- Man looks very distinguished up there.
- Thank you, Vivien.

01:38:28.568 --> 01:38:32.402
- That was a while ago.
- Yeah. I'm feeling the years now.

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.340
Yes.

01:38:36.676 --> 01:38:38.303
We all are now.

01:38:44.050 --> 01:38:45.847
You know, Vivien...

01:38:48.588 --> 01:38:51.182
they say you haven't really lived...

01:38:52.625 --> 01:38:55.025
unless you have a lot to regret.

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.730
I regret....

01:39:06.139 --> 01:39:07.970
I have some regrets.

01:39:16.816 --> 01:39:20.081
But I think we should remember
not what we lost...

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:23.985
but what we've done.

01:39:26.192 --> 01:39:28.854
All the lives we saved, and we did.

01:39:31.364 --> 01:39:33.832
We saved plenty, didn't we, Vivien?

01:39:34.234 --> 01:39:35.701
Yes, we did.

01:39:43.209 --> 01:39:44.301
No.

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:03.323
Vivien, it's Helen.

01:40:04.797 --> 01:40:06.856
I'm sorry to tell you...

01:40:06.966 --> 01:40:10.129
that Dr. Blalock passed away in his sleep
last night.

01:40:10.303 --> 01:40:14.262
We see death every day.
It doesn't make it any easier, does it?

01:40:16.142 --> 01:40:18.372
I'm very sorry.

01:40:44.237 --> 01:40:45.636
Today, we honor someone...

01:40:45.738 --> 01:40:48.229
who never took a course
in medical school...

01:40:48.341 --> 01:40:52.107
and still became
one of our greatest teachers of medicine.

01:40:53.513 --> 01:40:56.812
This individual
helped change the way we understand...

01:40:56.916 --> 01:40:59.384
how the human heart works forever.

01:41:00.453 --> 01:41:03.115
And now I'm honored to read;

01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:09.054
"The Board of Regents of this,
the Johns Hopkins University...

01:41:09.329 --> 01:41:13.060
"in consideration
of an innovative scientist...

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.237
"an outstanding teacher,
and a skilled clinical technician...

01:41:18.738 --> 01:41:21.969
"has this day
awarded this honorary doctorate...

01:41:23.409 --> 01:41:25.377
"to Mr. Vivien Thomas."

01:41:45.965 --> 01:41:48.092
Congratulations, Dr. Thomas.

01:42:06.786 --> 01:42:08.754
Thank you, Dr. Taussig.

01:42:11.157 --> 01:42:14.149
I'm not accustomed
to being in the limelight.

01:42:15.428 --> 01:42:17.828
So being placed in the position...

01:42:18.231 --> 01:42:20.358
I find myself in now...

01:42:21.334 --> 01:42:24.167
makes me quite humble...

01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:26.864
and a little proud.

01:42:28.341 --> 01:42:31.208
When I put my hammer and saw down...

01:42:32.512 --> 01:42:34.070
40 years ago...

01:42:35.081 --> 01:42:38.949
and was offered an opportunity
to work with a young surgeon...

01:42:39.719 --> 01:42:41.346
I had no idea...

01:42:43.489 --> 01:42:48.153
that I'd be able to make a mark
on an institution as prestigious as this one.

01:42:48.327 --> 01:42:50.261
I had no idea that I...

01:42:50.997 --> 01:42:54.763
would have any contribution
to make to medicine...

01:42:55.501 --> 01:43:00.029
that would merit this type of recognition.

01:43:05.144 --> 01:43:09.638
I simply say thank you to all of my family...

01:43:10.883 --> 01:43:13.443
and all of my friends who are here...

01:43:15.054 --> 01:43:18.956
and to all of my friends
who could not be here.

01:43:19.692 --> 01:43:21.626
I thank you very much.

01:43:33.239 --> 01:43:35.799
This is also a special occasion...

01:43:36.075 --> 01:43:39.135
to mark the unveiling
of your likeness, Vivien.

01:45:09.001 --> 01:45:12.767
Paging Dr. Thomas.
Dr. Vivien Thomas to the boardroom, please.
