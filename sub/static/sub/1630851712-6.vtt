00:51.384 --> 00:52.385
Hey.

00:52.469 --> 00:58.183
I'm making a rainbow-colored
kitty-cat xylophone!

00:58.266 --> 01:01.186
I put different amounts of water
in each jar,

01:01.269 --> 01:02.729
starting with a lot

01:02.812 --> 01:06.107
and going all the way down
to just a little.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.278
And since I love rainbows so much,
I had to make it rainbow-colored,

01:10.361 --> 01:13.114
using food coloring.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.908
Cool, right?

01:15.450 --> 01:19.954
The different amounts of water in each jar
make them each have a different sound.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.624
Do you want to hear
what they sound like? OK.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.172
Hey, that's a cool sound.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.054
And that's a cool sound, too.

01:36.137 --> 01:39.349
It's the Dollhouse Delivery.
Come on, let's go see what it is.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.319
Hey, Pandy.

01:51.986 --> 01:52.987
Paw bump?

01:53.571 --> 01:54.656
Whoosh!

01:55.949 --> 01:58.159
Let's see what's in our
Meow Meow Mailbox today.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.746
Whoa!

02:02.247 --> 02:04.332
Look at this.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.584
It's DJ Catnip. See?

02:06.668 --> 02:09.754
You can tell
because he's wearing his red sweatshirt,

02:09.838 --> 02:13.049
and his smiley face
with his favorite tooth.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.676
Let's see what's inside.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.304
Wait a minute.
I just remembered something.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.267
Today is DJ Catnip's big music show
in the Dollhouse.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.854
Hmm. Maybe he needs something
that's in here. Let's see.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.192
It's a microphone!

02:31.276 --> 02:32.944
Look how cool!

02:33.027 --> 02:34.904
It even has little cat ears.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.823
When you talk into it…

02:36.906 --> 02:39.200
…it makes your voice louder.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.996
-Hmm. I wonder what this button does?

02:43.079 --> 02:45.081
I wonder what this button does?

02:45.665 --> 02:48.376
I think that it records whatever I say.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.713
I think that it records
whatever I say.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.759
I think this is just what DJ Catnip
might need for his big music show.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.929
Now, let's get in the Dollhouse
and show him.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.141
OK.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.393
Are you ready?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.605
Time to get tiny.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.824
Whee!

03:19.908 --> 03:22.660
I'm over here in the music room.
Boogie on in!

03:23.912 --> 03:24.787
OK.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.998
I've got the microphone.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.626
-But first, we need to find Pandy.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.254
Oh, Pandy! Come out and play!

03:35.131 --> 03:38.676
Oh, Pandy! Come out and play!

03:39.469 --> 03:41.054
Tell me if you see Pandy.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.731
Hug attack!

03:53.900 --> 03:56.277
Hug attack!

03:56.361 --> 03:58.571
Is that what I really sound like?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.490
Uh-huh.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.158
Paw-tastic!

04:07.038 --> 04:08.498
-Huh?
-No, no!

04:08.581 --> 04:10.959
Ooh. That doesn't sound good. Come on.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.921
-That's not it.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.305
That's not the right sound, either.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.849
Hey, DJ Catnip. What's going on?

04:26.933 --> 04:29.227
Oh, hey, Gabby. Hey, Pandy.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.146
You know I'm putting on
my big music show today.

04:32.230 --> 04:36.276
-Ooh!
-And I invited all the Gabby Cats.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.527
Ooh!

04:37.610 --> 04:40.321
There's just one problem.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.615
I've lost my groove!

04:42.699 --> 04:43.533
Huh?

04:48.037 --> 04:48.871
Oh.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.750
I've lost my groove
and I can't make music without it!

04:53.251 --> 04:55.753
Wait, you lost your groove?

04:56.754 --> 04:57.714
What's a groove?

04:57.797 --> 05:01.759
Your groove is…
It's kind of hard to explain.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.972
But you know that special feeling you get
when you're playing music

05:06.055 --> 05:08.266
and singing and dancing?

05:08.349 --> 05:09.350
Oh, yeah.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.478
Like when your whole body
just feels the music?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.903
Yep! That's your groove.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.949
Usually, I hear a sound
and the music just comes right out of me.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.492
But for some reason…

05:29.829 --> 05:31.289
…it's not working.

05:31.372 --> 05:35.001
I've tried every instrument
in the music room.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.045
I know you're upset, DJ Catnip,

05:37.128 --> 05:39.797
but there's got to be some way
we can get your groove back.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.715
Yeah, look.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.594
We brought you this really cool microphone
for your music show.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.678
Thanks, Pandy.

05:45.762 --> 05:50.141
But if I don't get my groove back,
there's not going to be a music show.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.934
-Hey, everyone!

05:52.518 --> 05:54.187
Your pal CatRat here,

05:54.270 --> 05:59.192
ready to get down and get funky
at the big music show.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.401
Huh?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.320
Hey, what's wrong with Catnip?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.280
He's lost his groove, CatRat.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.366
Huh. He does look pretty un-groovy.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.911
Hey, Catnip, how can I help?

06:09.994 --> 06:11.329
I don't know, CatRat.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.916
I just can't find a sound
to get me moving and grooving.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.752
Not to worry. The CatRat is on it.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.796
Just let me think about it for a bit.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.798
I'm sure I'll come up
with something great.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.258
I always do.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.593
Thanks, CatRat.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.096
No problem. A-toodley-do!

06:29.388 --> 06:31.224
Well, I guess CatRat's on it.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.435
I think I know
how we can help, too.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.312
-You do?
-How?

06:36.395 --> 06:40.233
Well, you need a sound to get you moving
and grooving again, right?

06:40.316 --> 06:44.570
Right. But like I said, I've already tried
every sound in the music room.

06:45.154 --> 06:48.282
Maybe the right sound
isn't in the music room.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.828
Yeah. There are all kinds of sounds
in the Dollhouse.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.248
We just have to keep looking
until we find the right one.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.709
DJ Catnip,
we're gonna help you find your groove.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.419
Oh, thanks, guys.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.921
Where should we start?

07:03.047 --> 07:04.215
Hmm.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.553
-Hey, there's a sound!
-Sounds like the kitchen.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.430
Maybe we'll find the sound
you're looking for in there.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.891
Oh-ho! Well, what are we waiting for?

07:13.975 --> 07:16.561
-To the kitchen!

07:18.896 --> 07:21.149
I got the sound!

07:25.736 --> 07:28.114
Catnip? Gabby? Pandy?

07:28.698 --> 07:31.367
Oh, rats! I missed them.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.373
Cakey?

07:41.836 --> 07:46.048
Check it out, y'all.
I think this mess is the sound we heard.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.426
Cakey, are you in here?

07:48.509 --> 07:51.053
I'm stuck under a bowl!

07:51.137 --> 07:53.431
Don't worry, Cakey. We've got you.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.057
Which bowl are you under?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.935
Look under the biggest blue bowl.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.437
Help us find Cakey.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.190
Which is the biggest blue bowl?

08:05.443 --> 08:06.694
That one!

08:06.777 --> 08:08.529
You found me!

08:08.613 --> 08:10.239
Sprinkle party!

08:10.990 --> 08:12.909
Hey, don't mind if I do!

08:14.035 --> 08:15.661
Thanks for getting me out of there.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.540
I was getting ready to make some snacks
for DJ Catnip's music show,

08:19.624 --> 08:21.792
when everything just came tumbling down.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.128
Actually, Cakey, that's why we're here.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.215
I'm not sure there's gonna be
a music show today.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.593
There's not? How come?

08:30.676 --> 08:34.430
DJ Catnip's lost his groove,
and he can't make music without it.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.893
Yeah, I have to find a new sound
to get me moving and grooving again.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.269
A new sound, huh?

08:40.353 --> 08:43.231
Well, there's lots of sounds
in the kitchen.

08:43.314 --> 08:46.526
Yeah, DJ Catnip.
How about some kitchen sounds?

09:00.831 --> 09:02.792
Any of those sounds work?

09:06.504 --> 09:08.506
Those were some great sounds, Cakey,

09:08.589 --> 09:11.509
but none of those sounds
are bringing my groove back.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.554
That's OK, DJ. We'll find the right sound.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.473
Maybe a special snack would cheer you up?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.226
A snack sounds delicious.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.396
Well, it couldn't hurt.
Let's do it, Cakey.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.772
All right!

09:27.358 --> 09:32.029
-Ooh! Look at all this yummy stuff.
-What are we gonna make-y, Cakey?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.576
We're gonna make some Catnip Crunchies!

09:36.659 --> 09:37.952
Oh-ho! Whoa!

09:38.035 --> 09:39.495
Catnip Crunchies?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.832
That's right. Just follow me.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.794
The first step is to spread some jelly
on your rice cake.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.757
-Mm-mm! Looks good!

09:55.928 --> 09:59.682
Two banana slices
and two blueberries to make the eyes.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.641
Boop. Boop.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.018
Your turn.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.147
Boop. Boop.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.523
Great!

10:09.859 --> 10:12.320
Boop. Boop. Hi, eyes!

10:12.403 --> 10:16.365
Add some more blueberries
for the nose and smile.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.077
I'm smiling!

10:23.998 --> 10:28.711
Now put some strawberries
all around the edge to make DJ's red hood.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.796
Don't forget the ears!

10:31.380 --> 10:32.214
Come on!

10:34.592 --> 10:36.469
Oh, yeah! Sing it!

10:39.096 --> 10:41.140
Whoo! I'm looking good!

10:41.223 --> 10:42.516
Last step.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.561
Grab some pretzel sticks and add the legs.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.732
My legs! Ha!

10:52.818 --> 10:53.778
Ta-da!

10:53.861 --> 10:55.863
Catnip Crunchies!

10:55.946 --> 10:59.742
The yummiest, DJ Catnip-iest snack ever.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.327
Meow!

11:01.410 --> 11:04.038
These Catnip Crunchies look just like me!

11:05.623 --> 11:08.042
Mm-mm! Try it, Pandy.

11:08.876 --> 11:09.960
Here I go.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.254
Mm!

11:14.173 --> 11:16.050
-Mm!

11:16.133 --> 11:17.468
Good crunching!

11:18.761 --> 11:21.889
Thanks, Cakey.
That snack really did cheer me up.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.724
Oh, I'm so glad!

11:23.808 --> 11:27.728
I hope you find the sound that gets you
moving and grooving again, DJ.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.272
Oh, me too.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.983
We'll find it.
We just have to keep looking.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.568
-Huh?

11:36.695 --> 11:37.947
I know that sound!

11:38.030 --> 11:39.657
That's…

11:39.740 --> 11:41.742
…a flushing sound!

11:41.826 --> 11:44.954
Which room do you think
that sound came from?

11:46.038 --> 11:47.248
The bathroom!

11:47.331 --> 11:49.125
Come on, DJ Catnip.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.086
It's time to check out
the sounds of the bathroom.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.338
All righty. Here we go!

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
To the bathroom!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.299
Thanks, Cakey!

12:00.469 --> 12:01.470
Good luck!

12:02.138 --> 12:04.181
Cakey's rooting for you!

12:04.265 --> 12:07.560
-Huh?

12:08.894 --> 12:12.189
Oh. Hey, Cakey. I'm looking for DJ Catnip.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.943
They just left, CatRat.
They're heading to the bathroom.

12:16.026 --> 12:19.613
DJ Catnip's looking for a sound
that will bring his groove back.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.491
That's why I'm looking for him!

12:28.581 --> 12:32.293
Hi, Gabby, Pandy, DJ Catnip.
What brings you to the bathroom?

12:32.376 --> 12:34.670
-We're looking for a sound.
-A sound?

12:34.753 --> 12:37.256
DJ Catnip's lost his groove.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.550
Shimmering sea scales!

12:39.633 --> 12:43.512
It's true,
and I just can't make music without it.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.056
I need to find that special sound

12:46.140 --> 12:48.809
that will get me moving
and grooving again.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.311
Whoa!

12:50.394 --> 12:54.231
Well, sounds like what you need
is a bubble bath.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.400
-A bubble bath?
-Of course!

12:56.484 --> 13:00.529
Bubbles, they make
the best sounds in the whole bathroom.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.326
I think it will bring your groove
right back.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.955
Plus, bubble baths
make everyone feel better!

13:10.539 --> 13:11.582
That's true.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.630
-Hop in.
-Well, it's worth a try.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.391
-Got that sound.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.067
Don't you just love that sound?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.721
Bet you can't pop them all!

14:08.305 --> 14:10.599
-Ooh! Ooh! Got one!

14:10.683 --> 14:12.268
Pop! Got that one!

14:12.768 --> 14:14.937
Popping bubbles is so much fun!

14:15.020 --> 14:16.480
Pop! Pop! Pop! I got it!

14:22.027 --> 14:22.861
Whoo!

14:24.446 --> 14:27.575
That was the bubbliest bubble bath
I've ever had.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.326
Did the bubble sounds work?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.036
Yeah, did you get groove back?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.456
Nope.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.251
Those bubble sounds are great and all,

14:37.334 --> 14:39.795
but they're just not bringing out
the music in me.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.089
I'm sorry my bubbles didn't work, DJ,

14:42.172 --> 14:46.051
but I know you're gonna find the sound
you need to get your groove back.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.846
Thanks, MerCat, but I'm not so sure.

14:49.346 --> 14:53.559
What are we gonna do, Gabby?
DJ Catnip still hasn't found his groove.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.437
He hasn't found his groove… yet.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.063
But we're not giving up.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.900
There's got to be a sound
in the Dollhouse that will work.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.904
Hey! You guys hear that?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.742
Sounds like… tape.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.744
-And…

15:13.120 --> 15:13.996
markers?

15:14.079 --> 15:17.583
Tape and markers?
Those are craft room sounds.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.919
Maybe we can find your sound
in the craft room.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.047
Well, it's worth a try. Let's do it!

15:26.634 --> 15:27.760
Thanks, MerCat.

15:27.843 --> 15:28.844
Good luck!

15:30.137 --> 15:32.139
Oh, Catnip?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.811
Oops! Sorry, CatRat. You just missed him.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.689
I missed him again?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.239
-Thanks, Cat-A-Vator.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.959
Hey, Baby Box.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.294
Hi, guys! What's going on?

16:02.378 --> 16:06.465
DJ Catnip's lost his groove
and we're trying to help him get it back.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.258
You lost your groove?

16:08.342 --> 16:11.762
Yep, and if we don't find
that special sound that brings it back,

16:11.845 --> 16:13.889
I won't be able to make any more music.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.768
But your big music show is today.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.186
That's why we're here.

16:19.269 --> 16:22.481
We're hoping there's a sound
in the craft room that will do the trick.

16:22.564 --> 16:26.235
Well, I do make a lot of different noises
when I'm crafting.

16:26.318 --> 16:31.073
Hey! I was just about to start
a special art project.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.866
Do you want to make it with me?

16:33.534 --> 16:34.535
-Yeah!
-OK!

16:34.618 --> 16:35.953
Let's do it!

16:36.036 --> 16:38.998
We'll make all kinds
of craft-y-riffic sounds

16:39.081 --> 16:40.457
if we make it together.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.254
Ta-da!

17:27.337 --> 17:29.923
It's a poster for your music show.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.383
What do you think?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.802
It's cat-tastic, Baby Box!

17:33.886 --> 17:36.805
Did our craft sounds
bring your groove back?

17:41.643 --> 17:42.936
Sorry, everyone.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.980
It's just no use!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.983
I don't think
I'll ever find my groove again.

17:51.361 --> 17:55.199
Looks like DJ Catnip's
big music show is canceled.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.368
Wait! DJ Catnip, don't cancel your show!

17:58.994 --> 18:00.496
What are we gonna do?

18:00.579 --> 18:04.625
We've tried so many different sounds
and none of them worked.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.919
There has to be something else we can try.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.504
-Ah!

18:08.587 --> 18:10.506
Whoa! Oh, no!

18:15.010 --> 18:16.178
Whoa! Whoa!

18:16.678 --> 18:20.516
-Phew! I got it!

18:23.102 --> 18:24.103
Hey!

18:24.645 --> 18:25.896
Do you hear that?

18:27.773 --> 18:28.941
I think…

18:29.566 --> 18:30.859
I'm getting…

18:31.527 --> 18:33.403
my groove back!

18:38.033 --> 18:40.619
Finally! I found you.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.547
CatRat, you helped me get my groove back!

18:51.630 --> 18:53.882
Well, yeah. Of course I did.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.176
You can always count on
your buddy, CatRat.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.886
Listen up!

18:57.970 --> 19:03.767
Dance on down to the music room,
because DJ Catnip's ready to groove!

19:03.851 --> 19:06.562
-Yay!
-Time for the show! Coming, DJ!

19:07.980 --> 19:10.566
DJ Catnip, you got your groove back!

19:11.150 --> 19:12.442
What sound did it?

19:12.526 --> 19:16.655
It turns out I didn't need one sound
to get my groove back,

19:16.738 --> 19:19.449
I needed all the sounds of the Dollhouse.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.869
And a little help from my friends.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.957
So, listen up, Gabby Cats,
because this song's for you!

20:14.922 --> 20:18.926
DJ Catnip is back!

20:19.593 --> 20:23.138
Thanks for helping DJ Catnip
find his groove.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.682
Are you ready for one more surprise?

20:41.823 --> 20:43.867
It's me, Gabby!

21:56.398 --> 21:57.482
Hey, Gabby Cats.

21:58.942 --> 21:59.818
Yes, you will.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.237
Let's do this!

22:19.004 --> 22:19.838
Phew!

22:19.921 --> 22:23.508
I'm so glad that we helped DJ Catnip
get his groove back.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.719
His groove is his favorite thing.

22:28.889 --> 22:32.142
-And Floyd sounds happy, too.

22:32.225 --> 22:35.062
You hear that? He's purring a little tune.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.733
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.692
Bye!
