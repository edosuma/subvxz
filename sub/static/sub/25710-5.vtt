00:00.925 --> 00:03.205
This case has taken
some very unexpected turns.

00:04.205 --> 00:06.725
- Okay.
- Take a look at this.

00:07.125 --> 00:08.365
KGB.

00:08.885 --> 00:09.925
Are you a spy?

00:10.205 --> 00:12.525
The only letters Mr. Matthews
would communicate.

00:12.605 --> 00:15.925
A message he was trying very hard
to deliver about his killers.

00:16.004 --> 00:19.725
So you think Ash was killed by the KGB?

00:19.805 --> 00:22.765
Yes. A hit and run didn't kill him,
so they finished the job.

00:23.085 --> 00:24.245
Not now!

00:24.325 --> 00:28.205
You're gonna wanna hear this.
A nurse has just confessed.

00:28.285 --> 00:29.685
- What?
- <i>I've got a cardiac arrest.</i>

00:30.085 --> 00:33.005
She made a statement half an hour ago.
They're faxing it through now.

00:34.805 --> 00:37.285
Shit! I thought this was a big case.

00:38.245 --> 00:40.245
He can't put the finger of blame on us.

00:40.925 --> 00:42.205
We've got nothing to fear.

00:42.725 --> 00:43.765
It'll be all right.

00:44.885 --> 00:46.365
I just want this to be over.

00:46.805 --> 00:48.405
We're in the clear.

00:48.485 --> 00:49.685
It's been a rough couple of days,

00:49.765 --> 00:51.845
but, er... we can sleep easy tonight.

00:54.565 --> 00:55.885
KGB!

01:00.805 --> 01:02.085
KGB! Out of my way.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.724
Oi-oi, there goes George Smiley.

01:07.445 --> 01:09.805
I will have you!

01:11.605 --> 01:13.605
Alpha Bravo five five, Kilo Golf Bravo.

01:13.685 --> 01:15.805
Suspect wanted in connection
with a murder investigation.

01:15.885 --> 01:16.885
Out of my way!

01:19.485 --> 01:20.605
Oh, shit!

01:20.965 --> 01:22.285
Also, my key card doesn't work.

01:22.365 --> 01:24.925
I need to get to the Chief,
but I can't get access to the third floor.

01:25.005 --> 01:26.405
Hello? Hello?

01:26.485 --> 01:27.805
Jesus! Great!

01:27.885 --> 01:31.605
I need to see
Chief Superintendent Henchy urgently.

01:31.685 --> 01:33.365
- Please can you buzz me in?
- You need to come with us.

01:33.445 --> 01:35.205
What? No.
I'm on an extremely important case.

01:35.285 --> 01:36.485
I've got no time for this. Buzz me in.

01:36.565 --> 01:38.405
We've been told
that you need to come with us.

01:38.485 --> 01:40.085
By who?

01:41.085 --> 01:43.245
Ma'am, just the person
I need to speak to.

01:43.325 --> 01:45.085
- Get your hands off me!
- Officer Hayward,

01:45.165 --> 01:47.205
you just need to come with the lads.
Be a good boy, yeah?

01:47.285 --> 01:49.285
- But the car, KGB...
- Take him down.

01:50.205 --> 01:53.085
You don't understand! There's...

01:53.165 --> 01:56.125
I'd just shut up if I were you,
you fucking loony.

01:57.445 --> 01:58.485
Rude!

02:01.572 --> 02:06.572
Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:09.005 --> 02:10.485
Sit down, Officer Hayward.

02:12.045 --> 02:14.445
Now, there are concerns around here

02:14.525 --> 02:17.565
that you're having some kind of episode.

02:17.645 --> 02:19.765
I can assure you, ma'am,
that I am absolutely fine.

02:19.845 --> 02:23.005
Running round the station like
a bull in a china shop, shouting "KGB!"

02:23.605 --> 02:25.085
I tipped you for the top, Chris.

02:25.965 --> 02:27.765
At this rate,
the only top you're going to make it to

02:27.845 --> 02:29.205
is the top of bloody shit school.

02:29.285 --> 02:31.845
I was wrong about the whole spy thing,
but KGB is actually...

02:31.925 --> 02:33.765
God, it's like sitting
opposite your father.

02:34.845 --> 02:36.365
You're a chip off the old block, Chris.

02:36.445 --> 02:37.885
Ma'am, I'm not like him, I promise.

02:37.965 --> 02:39.485
Good, because he was trouble, Chris.

02:43.805 --> 02:46.405
Look, I'd like you to take a few days,
clear your head.

02:46.485 --> 02:48.365
Spend the time with your wife, you know?

02:49.485 --> 02:52.245
- How old's your little one now?
- 18 months, ma'am.

02:52.525 --> 02:55.005
Well, use this time to bond with him.
What's his name?

02:55.085 --> 02:56.245
It's Polly.

02:57.605 --> 02:58.765
You called your little boy Polly?

02:59.725 --> 03:01.805
No, ma'am, he's a girl. She's a girl.

03:01.885 --> 03:04.725
Ah. Use this time to bond with her, then.
You won't get it back.

03:05.605 --> 03:07.085
- But ma'am...
- That's an order.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.845
Yes, ma'am.

03:16.445 --> 03:17.845
Are you still gonna get paid?

03:20.045 --> 03:22.525
- Chris?
- Yes! It's just for a few days.

03:23.405 --> 03:26.685
What is this all about?
Is it the Russian spy case again?

03:26.765 --> 03:30.045
It's not the Russian spy case.
The car number plate was KGB.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.365
Why would the KGB have a number plate
that says KGB?

03:33.445 --> 03:35.925
- That wouldn't be very secret, would it?
- No, I didn't say that.

03:36.005 --> 03:38.205
James Bond doesn't have
a personalized number plate

03:38.285 --> 03:39.485
that says "Bond 007", does he?

03:39.565 --> 03:43.005
No, you don't understand.
I was wrong about the KGB thing.

03:43.085 --> 03:44.205
Good.

03:44.885 --> 03:48.525
Good. That's a start.
Admitting you're wrong is the first step.

03:48.605 --> 03:52.205
I'm not! I was wrong about one detail,
but overall I'm right!

03:53.845 --> 03:55.125
Great, now you've upset Polly!

03:55.205 --> 03:59.245
Hey, don't cry. Mummy and Daddy
are just having a little discussion.

03:59.325 --> 04:01.245
- Everything's all right.
- Everything is not all right!

04:01.325 --> 04:03.845
They won't listen to me,
but they will soon enough.

04:05.925 --> 04:09.445
So, you're right and the rest
of the police force are wrong?

04:10.005 --> 04:11.645
Yes.

04:12.925 --> 04:14.125
- Get out.
- What?

04:14.205 --> 04:16.644
- Get out the car.
- But we're miles away from home.

04:16.725 --> 04:18.605
I don't care. You can walk.

What is all this?
Have they got to my boss?

04:38.085 --> 04:39.645
Why did they kill Ash Matthews?

04:39.725 --> 04:41.445
Am I onto them or am I just crazy?

04:41.965 --> 04:43.205
I'd say you are, mate.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.085
Piss off, Sheeran.

04:50.805 --> 04:51.845
Hello?

04:53.645 --> 04:54.765
Penny?

04:57.725 --> 04:58.725
Penny!

05:32.045 --> 05:33.285
Shit!

05:34.645 --> 05:36.245
<i>I don't consider it that way.</i>

05:36.325 --> 05:37.925
<i>And then, on top of everything else,</i>

05:38.005 --> 05:40.205
<i>you're not even being honest
with yourself.</i>

05:41.445 --> 05:42.885
<i>Oh, yes, I am!</i>

05:46.085 --> 05:50.125
Penny, sorry about the past few weeks.

05:51.245 --> 05:54.765
I think this free time
is going to be really good for me...

05:56.765 --> 05:58.445
and for us.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.885
<i>I'm going to prove it
if it's the last thing I do.</i>

06:02.285 --> 06:04.765
<i>I'm right, damn it! I know I'm right.</i>

06:12.485 --> 06:15.725
<i>This is the log of Officer
Hayward, Operation Prove I'm Right.</i>

06:16.845 --> 06:18.965
Sunday the 15th, 2200 hours.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.845
I'm convinced there are two men
out there getting away with murder,

06:21.925 --> 06:25.925
Daniel Glass and Dr. Iain Glennis,
but how do I prove I'm right?

06:27.165 --> 06:30.645
Think, think. The answers are all there.

06:34.685 --> 06:38.045
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll crack this one for both of us.

06:43.085 --> 06:45.005
<i>Sunday, 0700 hours.</i>

06:45.085 --> 06:48.245
<i>Dreamt of nothing but this case,
apart from my recurring nightmare</i>

06:48.325 --> 06:50.405
<i>of being chased by a man
made out of scrambled eggs.</i>

06:50.645 --> 06:53.085
<i>I must go back
and speak to the witnesses myself.</i>

06:53.565 --> 06:54.885
Argh!

06:54.965 --> 06:57.165
<i>And I must</i> not <i>sleep in that chair again.</i>

06:57.245 --> 06:58.245
Shit!

07:05.165 --> 07:07.765
<i>Mr. Matthews might have valuable
information about his attempted murder.</i>

07:11.885 --> 07:13.925
Yes? Can I help you?
What's wrong with your neck?

07:14.005 --> 07:16.165
How do you know there's something wrong
with my neck?

07:16.245 --> 07:17.645
I'm a nurse. It's my job to know.

07:17.725 --> 07:20.845
I slept badly.
Anyway, that's not why I'm here.

07:20.925 --> 07:24.125
You are Julie Galchinski, a ward nurse
at the Thames Royal Infirmary?

07:24.205 --> 07:25.405
Yes, I am.

07:25.485 --> 07:29.285
I feel we've met before, but in this life,
not a past one!

07:29.365 --> 07:32.165
Um... yes, we will have met.

07:32.245 --> 07:34.245
I was stationed in Ash Matthews' room.

07:34.325 --> 07:36.445
The patient you're accused of
accidentally killing.

07:36.525 --> 07:39.245
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions,
if I may.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.645
Fine. I'm getting used to it.

07:40.725 --> 07:41.605
- Can I come inside?
- No.

07:41.685 --> 07:44.125
Okay. Nurse Galchinski,
you were the last person

07:44.205 --> 07:47.045
to go into Ash Matthews' room
before he suffered a cardiac arrest.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.725
It was my duty to attach his feeding tube,

07:49.805 --> 07:52.925
and that is what killed him,
but as I said to the other policeman,

07:53.045 --> 07:54.125
I didn't kill him.

07:55.285 --> 07:57.805
Anyone could've got into that room
after me.

07:57.885 --> 07:59.765
There was no security on the door.

07:59.845 --> 08:03.125
Well, er, there was,
until I was commanded to step down.

08:03.205 --> 08:05.845
I know the difference
between the end of a feeding tube

08:05.925 --> 08:07.045
and the end of a drip line.

08:07.125 --> 08:10.885
When I charge my phone,
I don't stick a mini USB charger

08:10.965 --> 08:13.405
- into the Thunderbolt connector!
- Look, I believe you.

08:13.485 --> 08:14.565
No, you don't.

08:15.525 --> 08:17.885
Why are you here?
Where's your police badge?

08:17.965 --> 08:19.805
Hey, I'm the one
doing the questioning here.

08:19.885 --> 08:22.925
I know, I'll call 999
and see if they can verify

08:23.005 --> 08:24.725
that you're who you say you are.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.365
What is that?

08:36.525 --> 08:40.365
<i>Sunday, ten past 1200 hours.
Speaking to witnesses is a waste of time.</i>

08:40.725 --> 08:43.044
<i>If you want to catch the big fish,
you've got to follow...</i>

08:43.605 --> 08:45.005
<i>the... big fish.</i>

08:48.285 --> 08:50.725
<i>Having purchased a high-tech
listening device and disguise,</i>

08:50.805 --> 08:53.365
<i>I've tracked Dr. Glennis
to Barlow Lake Country Club.</i>

08:53.445 --> 08:55.005
What are you up to?

08:59.725 --> 09:01.965
<i>...what happened in the garden.</i>

09:02.405 --> 09:03.685
You haven't been arrested, have you?

09:17.245 --> 09:19.165
300-foot range, my...

09:20.125 --> 09:22.405
foot. Can't hear a ruddy thing!

09:22.965 --> 09:24.205
Sorry, do you work here?

09:25.725 --> 09:27.645
Yes. Yes, I do.

09:27.725 --> 09:29.805
I just start today.
I've not got my uniform yet.

09:30.365 --> 09:31.485
Right, you can give me a hand

09:31.565 --> 09:34.045
shifting some crates of avocados
that just got delivered. 200 of ‘em.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.125
200?

09:36.125 --> 09:37.165
Right.

09:45.005 --> 09:46.245
Put your back into it, mate.

09:46.565 --> 09:47.685
Sorry.

09:48.325 --> 09:50.965
<i>Sunday, 2200 hours. Just arrived home.</i>

09:51.325 --> 09:53.205
<i>After lugging the 200 crates of avocados,</i>

09:53.285 --> 09:56.565
<i>a second delivery of tomatoes arrived,
300 crates.</i>

09:58.405 --> 10:00.085
I've established
that Dr. Glennis frequents

10:00.165 --> 10:02.165
the prestigious Barlow Lake Country Club.

10:02.245 --> 10:04.845
Other members include
the recently deceased Kenny West.

10:04.925 --> 10:08.005
Did Dr. Glennis and Daniel Glass
have anything to do with his death?

10:14.765 --> 10:17.045
Monday the 16th, 1400 hours.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.765
Dr. Glennis seems
to have injured his hand

10:18.845 --> 10:23.005
after visiting fellow suspect Daniel Glass
at his place of work, We Cover Insurance.

10:24.245 --> 10:25.245
Oh!

10:26.405 --> 10:27.885
Come on, wind it down.

10:30.405 --> 10:33.165
Officer Hayward, what <i>are</i> you up to?

10:33.765 --> 10:34.965
Sitting in my car.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.645
Right, so you're not surveilling anyone?

10:39.725 --> 10:43.525
Look, we had a call about a weird guy
acting suspiciously in a car.

10:43.605 --> 10:46.405
- Lucky for you I came to check it out.
- Lucky me.

10:46.765 --> 10:48.245
Yes, lucky you!

10:48.925 --> 10:50.485
Because I'm not gonna report it.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.725
I thought I was a bit heavy-handed
with you last time.

10:54.565 --> 10:56.765
I'm sorry about that.

10:56.845 --> 10:58.765
Can you step away from my vehicle,
please?

10:59.605 --> 11:01.045
You always were a prick.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.245
Are you all right, sir?

11:04.645 --> 11:07.925
Er... Yes, yes, fine. I just...

11:08.005 --> 11:09.845
I caught it on, er...

11:10.765 --> 11:12.365
I can't remember what I caught it on!

11:12.885 --> 11:14.285
What a ninny!

11:14.685 --> 11:16.205
I don't know why this is being covered up.

11:16.285 --> 11:18.125
They've even got to the lads
in our precinct.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.485
I wonder if they've got to the Chief too.

11:21.445 --> 11:22.965
Their eyes are everywhere, Dad.

11:27.045 --> 11:28.045
Watching me.

11:30.405 --> 11:32.125
I need to be anonymous.

11:46.610 --> 11:47.850
There's your dummy.

11:50.690 --> 11:51.690
Good girl.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.250
<i>Recording.</i>

11:59.330 --> 12:01.650
Tuesday, 1200 hours 45 minutes.

12:01.730 --> 12:03.610
Daniel Glass is on a call
to an unknown individual

12:03.690 --> 12:06.850
outside Dr. Glennis's place of work,
St Frederick's Clinic.

12:12.970 --> 12:14.650
...I'm good for weed, thanks.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.130
Do you know anyone
who'd buy cancer medication?

12:20.890 --> 12:22.010
Are you interested?

12:22.090 --> 12:23.690
<i>No I'm not interested in cancer meds...</i>

12:24.370 --> 12:27.490
<i>The evidence to link my two
suspects to the murder of Ash Matthews</i>

12:27.570 --> 12:29.650
<i>has so far proven elusive, but this...</i>

12:29.730 --> 12:31.250
<i>this is the missing piece of the puzzle</i>

12:31.330 --> 12:34.690
<i>that I needed to complete the...
jigsaw puzzle.</i>

12:36.050 --> 12:39.890
Dr. Glennis and Daniel Glass
are liaising with known drug dealers.

12:39.970 --> 12:42.210
Kenny West dead
in mysterious circumstances

12:42.290 --> 12:43.650
along with Ash Matthews.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.730
Far from being KGB spies,
my investigation has led me to think

12:46.810 --> 12:48.970
that they're part of
an international drugs ring.

12:52.050 --> 12:54.090
What a lovely picture.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.610
<i>Wednesday the 18th, 0800 hours.</i>

13:01.690 --> 13:04.370
<i>Daniel Glass appears to have arranged
a clandestine meeting.</i>

13:04.850 --> 13:07.970
<i>A deal must be going down.
I must not blow my cover.</i>

13:16.290 --> 13:17.290
Oh!

13:17.770 --> 13:19.210
Give me back my phone!

13:20.530 --> 13:21.530
You're welcome.

13:23.690 --> 13:24.890
For shit's sake!

13:26.930 --> 13:29.650
<i>Unfortunately, I was dragged away
by important police business,</i>

13:29.730 --> 13:31.490
<i>but not before
seeing Daniel's contact arrive...</i>

13:31.570 --> 13:32.810
Why are we meeting so early?

13:32.890 --> 13:36.490
<i>...dressed as a courier,
the one and only Dr. Glennis.</i>

13:36.570 --> 13:38.170
Look, we've got a big problem.

13:38.690 --> 13:41.210
<i>1100 hours.
After getting out of my disguise</i>

13:41.290 --> 13:43.330
<i>to deal with a private matter,
I am now back in my disguise</i>

13:43.410 --> 13:44.850
<i>on the tail of Dr. Glennis.</i>

13:44.930 --> 13:48.170
<i>I can only assume he is delivering drugs
to someone, but who?</i>

13:52.490 --> 13:53.730
Where is he going?

13:55.730 --> 13:57.530
You and me are going on an adventure.

13:58.410 --> 14:02.290
Daddy can't turn round because he hurt
his neck staying up all night working...

14:03.650 --> 14:06.410
trying to make the world a safer place
for you to live in.

14:07.090 --> 14:09.610
Your mother thinks I've gone mad.
Do you think I've gone mad?

14:11.290 --> 14:12.450
Of course you don't.

14:13.410 --> 14:17.090
You'll grow up one day to be
a police officer, maybe even a detective.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.090
But for now, let's make you a constable.
Does that sound like fun?

14:22.170 --> 14:23.530
Constable Polly.

14:27.290 --> 14:29.330
I know Kenny's house
is around here somewhere.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.570
This better not be
some wild goose chase.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.010
Oh, there, there, Constable Polly.

14:37.090 --> 14:39.290
I'm sure this will be relevant
to our investigation.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.770
Oh, darling, I'll get your dummy for you

14:41.850 --> 14:45.250
just as soon as this naughty doctor
has arrived where he's meant to be, okay?

14:45.810 --> 14:47.130
I can't stop, love.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.490
I'll get it for you, love.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.210
Nearly got it for you.

15:01.090 --> 15:02.450
Ah, there.

15:05.050 --> 15:05.850
All better now?

15:06.690 --> 15:07.850
Shit!

15:18.490 --> 15:22.490
Er, Daddy's just going to go and see
if that nice man is still alive.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.690
You're in charge till I get back.

15:35.970 --> 15:37.090
Shit!

15:45.530 --> 15:48.170
<i>After an unexpected development
in my investigation,</i>

15:48.250 --> 15:51.410
<i>I've decided to take a breather
to plan my next move.</i>

15:53.770 --> 15:57.570
Probably fine, isn't he...
Constable Polly?

16:00.530 --> 16:03.770
Daddy's just going to, er, drive us back

16:03.850 --> 16:09.090
to... check that the nice man
is still alive, okay?

16:17.090 --> 16:18.930
Oh, what a beautiful house.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.770
If anyone asks,
we're just a mother and daughter

16:21.850 --> 16:23.370
looking for changing facilities.

16:28.130 --> 16:31.370
I wonder if there's anyone at
the back of the house that can help me?

16:31.730 --> 16:32.650
Hello?

16:37.210 --> 16:38.930
Oh, God, he's dead! Shit!

16:40.850 --> 16:42.770
No, mustn't contaminate the scene.

16:46.610 --> 16:47.650
Hello!

16:49.250 --> 16:50.290
Bingo!

16:54.690 --> 16:56.610
I need that camera.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.490
It's still recording.

17:02.130 --> 17:03.490
As if this'll work.

17:04.329 --> 17:06.410
Let's see if I can get that footage
downloaded.

17:09.369 --> 17:10.890
For shit's sake!

17:15.490 --> 17:16.810
This could be the hard evidence I need.

17:19.130 --> 17:20.930
Oh, Christ almighty!

17:23.609 --> 17:24.970
As if!

17:28.730 --> 17:29.970
Double bingo!

17:42.370 --> 17:44.250
Let's get back to HQ, Polly.

17:47.610 --> 17:50.730
Right, let's see what the doctor
was up to,

17:51.330 --> 17:52.530
God rest his soul.

17:55.050 --> 17:57.170
This'll prove us right.

17:58.090 --> 17:59.970
She'll be my boss one day, won't she, Dad?

18:02.010 --> 18:06.330
<i>Botheration! 07700 900 843.
Dr. Iain Glennis speaking.</i>

18:07.130 --> 18:09.970
<i>Oh, hello, Daniel. Yes, I'm on his tail.</i>

18:11.050 --> 18:13.730
<i>He didn't steal a car.
He took another You-Ber.</i>

18:13.810 --> 18:15.090
A You-Ber?

18:15.770 --> 18:16.810
Whose tail are you on?

18:17.570 --> 18:19.170
<i>If I can cut a man's brakes,</i>

18:19.250 --> 18:21.490
<i>I'm pretty sure I can bash his brains in.</i>

18:21.570 --> 18:23.930
Cut whose brakes? Bash whose brakes in?

18:24.010 --> 18:27.890
<i>When you said he'd stolen
the Toyota Rav 4 with a Christian fish,</i>

18:27.970 --> 18:30.250
<i>I got to it before he did
and snipped the brakes.</i>

18:30.330 --> 18:31.770
Red Toyota Rav 4.

18:32.330 --> 18:33.570
Very interesting.

18:33.650 --> 18:36.530
<i>Yes, yes, I cut his brakes.
I'm not proud of it, Daniel, but...</i>

18:36.610 --> 18:37.650
There's our car, Polly.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.490
<i>...it's either him or us.</i>

18:39.570 --> 18:40.610
Oops!

18:42.810 --> 18:45.730
We'll have to cut that little bit out,
won't we, Constable Polly?

18:47.450 --> 18:49.690
<i>Hello? Daniel? Hello?</i>

18:49.770 --> 18:53.130
<i>If he talks to me like that again,</i>
<i>I'll cut</i> his <i>bloody brakes!</i>

18:53.210 --> 18:54.450
He's psychotic.

18:55.370 --> 18:58.050
I think we're getting close
to where we had our accident.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.090
Sorry.

19:11.850 --> 19:15.930
Oh... I think someone
needs their nappy changing.

19:22.530 --> 19:23.850
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

19:38.530 --> 19:39.690
Okay, okay.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.890
Better remove us from this madness.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.690
<i>Delete selection?</i>

20:02.810 --> 20:03.970
What are you doing?

20:04.570 --> 20:06.610
- Penny?
- Why are you wearing my clothes?

20:06.690 --> 20:08.810
- I can explain.
- And my makeup?

20:10.330 --> 20:11.490
What are you doing?

20:11.930 --> 20:13.890
- You're insane.
- No, look, I've got it.

20:13.970 --> 20:16.010
I've got the evidence
that proves I'm right.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.970
- Oh, I'm thrilled.
- I can show you.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.810
Just let me prove to you that I'm right.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.090
Please. It'll explain all of my behavior.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.730
Come on, Penny, for us, for our family.

20:25.730 --> 20:26.770
Go on, then.

20:31.170 --> 20:34.530
Just taking a little time to complete.
I had to delete a bit.

20:37.330 --> 20:38.290
Come on!

20:38.730 --> 20:41.210
- I don't have time for this.
- Just give me a few more minutes.

20:41.850 --> 20:43.650
- This had better be good.
- I promise you,

20:43.730 --> 20:45.290
when you see this, it'll all make sense.

20:46.890 --> 20:47.930
What?

20:50.930 --> 20:52.810
Great, yeah, that explains everything.

20:52.890 --> 20:56.050
I must've deleted the rest by mistake.
This isn't the clip.

20:56.650 --> 20:58.930
- I don't know what's happening.
- I'll tell you what's happening.

20:59.810 --> 21:00.930
I'm leaving you, Chris.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.290
Penny!

21:07.850 --> 21:08.930
Shit!

21:10.210 --> 21:11.970
I'm sorry, Dad. I screwed up.

21:12.730 --> 21:16.650
But don't worry, I will prove I was right.
I'll make you proud yet.

21:18.090 --> 21:19.090
Who are you talking to?

21:19.170 --> 21:20.970
I wasn't talking to anyone.
It must be the radio.

21:22.130 --> 21:24.570
You're talking to that photo of your dad
again, aren't you?

21:25.930 --> 21:26.850
No.

21:28.090 --> 21:31.330
Chris! He was kicked off the force.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.610
He wrote four episodes of <i>The Bill</i>

21:33.690 --> 21:36.410
before he was kicked off that
for plagiarizing <i>Miami Vice.</i>

21:36.490 --> 21:39.370
He became an alcoholic
and left you and your mother

21:39.450 --> 21:41.770
when you were little.
You should hate that man.

21:43.450 --> 21:44.770
My dad was a hero.

21:46.610 --> 21:48.250
And they were <i>similar</i> plots!

21:48.810 --> 21:50.010
Not the same!

21:54.690 --> 21:55.890
Penny...

22:00.290 --> 22:01.450
You.

22:01.530 --> 22:02.530
You.

22:02.610 --> 22:04.330
I'm coming for you.
