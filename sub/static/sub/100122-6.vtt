00:07.000 --> 00:09.029
Previously on "The Purge"...

00:09.030 --> 00:10.197
Long time no see.

00:10.198 --> 00:11.979
The hell, Ryan? You called her?

00:11.980 --> 00:12.991
I'm your savior here.

00:12.992 --> 00:14.809
You cut me into whatever
you're planning.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.203
Your husband and I had a deal.

00:16.204 --> 00:19.249
They got us the name of the
person who tried to Purge me.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.660
- Sam Tucker.
- We had an affair.

00:22.752 --> 00:24.502
So you think someone did this to her.

00:24.503 --> 00:27.609
We have cameras. They
might've caught something.

00:39.394 --> 00:40.561
These are test subjects.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.669
What was she studying them for?

00:41.670 --> 00:43.519
That data suggests that the Purge

00:43.520 --> 00:45.315
is making people want to kill more.

00:47.777 --> 00:51.060
Not just on Purge, but
every day of the year.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.519
Plenty of God-loving
Americans fear the Purge.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.541
Fear is the first step on
the long road to respect.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.909
But this recent act...

01:04.910 --> 01:07.759
a Cooke University student
killed in his dormitory...

01:07.760 --> 01:08.999
that's cowardice.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.469
So how is an honest hardworking,

01:12.470 --> 01:13.589
Purge-loving American

01:13.590 --> 01:17.769
supposed to think about
this Campus Killer, Lena?

01:17.770 --> 01:18.999
Well, personally, Bobby,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.509
I feel that these reports
are completely overblown.

01:22.510 --> 01:25.479
That dead student had a long
history of depression...

01:25.480 --> 01:27.170
I... I'm sorry, but depressed people

01:27.173 --> 01:28.814
don't stab themselves repeatedly.

01:28.815 --> 01:30.612
I mean, how about the
farmer who supposedly

01:30.613 --> 01:32.079
died of heat stroke?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.039
How exactly does a corpse bury itself?

01:34.040 --> 01:35.259
There you go again.

01:35.260 --> 01:39.299
You're taking unsubstantiated
conspiracy theory as gospel.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.899
What about the girl who was
killed on the same campus?

01:41.900 --> 01:43.739
What... what about the security footage

01:43.740 --> 01:46.239
of the masked person stalking this girl?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.469
Easily faked.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.779
For those of you just joining us,

01:48.780 --> 01:50.799
this is the "Bobby Sheridan Show."

01:50.800 --> 01:52.979
And this is Bobby Sheridan with
one of our favorite guests,

01:52.980 --> 01:56.178
Lena Dash of the NFFA,
and a newcomer to our show,

01:56.179 --> 01:57.999
award-winning "America Unplugged"

01:58.000 --> 01:59.840
news correspondent, Sydney Rivera.

01:59.849 --> 02:02.479
So before we bury ourselves, in detail,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.499
Sydney, do you really think
some killer has the balls

02:05.500 --> 02:07.179
to attack off-Purge?

02:07.180 --> 02:09.999
Not only do I think someone
is killing off-Purge,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.109
but I think we have to
entertain the possibility

02:13.110 --> 02:16.829
that these murders might be
a product of NFFA policy.

02:16.830 --> 02:19.494
Oh, now, Sydney, you are
skating on thin ice there.

02:19.495 --> 02:22.219
Everyone knows the Purge brings peace.

02:22.220 --> 02:23.939
It calms the inner demons.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.339
I say we don't need less
Purge, we need more.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.792
How about a biannual Purge?

02:27.793 --> 02:29.119
Why stop there, Bobby?

02:29.120 --> 02:32.139
I mean, America needs a good
old-fashioned cleansing.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.499
I... I'm sorry. Are you
serious suggesting

02:34.500 --> 02:37.552
the solution for off-Purge
violence is more violence?

02:37.553 --> 02:39.019
Damn straight.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.219
You know, Sydney, I... I get the feeling

02:41.220 --> 02:42.359
that you haven't experienced

02:42.360 --> 02:44.390
a Purge up close and personal.

02:44.394 --> 02:47.438
Maybe next year I can
help you out with that.

02:49.315 --> 02:51.099
You're listening to
"Bobby Sheridan Live."

02:51.100 --> 02:54.699
We'll be right back after
this word from Insta-Glue,

02:54.700 --> 02:56.859
the only household adhesive FDA approved

02:56.860 --> 02:58.519
to treat gunshot wounds and stabbings.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.576
Insta-Glue, the glue that clots.

03:01.577 --> 03:04.409
Ladies, fantastic.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.664
I know, right?

03:05.665 --> 03:07.499
Sydney, you are a goddamn natural.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.599
I mean, the fans are just gonna

03:08.600 --> 03:10.624
- eat you up with a spoon.
- Great show.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.505
Did you just call for a
fucking Purge on me?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.259
Oh, I did you a favor.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.599
Yeah, yeah. Sydney, you're new.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.880
You, uh, look at this.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.219
That's the Urge2Purge app.

03:22.220 --> 03:24.641
It scans the internet for
active death threats.

03:24.642 --> 03:26.394
You've popped 200 since we went live.

03:26.395 --> 03:27.809
You're on fire, girl.

03:27.810 --> 03:30.640
And I don't mean to brag,
but check mine out.

03:30.650 --> 03:33.817
I broke a million last week.

03:33.818 --> 03:36.237
It's been great for my brand.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.179
Truth is you're nobody in America

03:40.180 --> 03:42.993
unless somebody wants to Purge you.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

03:59.600 --> 04:02.839
You were close with one
of the victims, Andy Tran.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.390
People saw you hanging around
his dorm room regularly.

04:05.391 --> 04:07.839
But on the afternoon of the murder,

04:07.840 --> 04:09.919
you were in the frat house alone?

04:09.920 --> 04:16.019
I told you I was working on
a paper and I dozed off.

04:16.019 --> 04:17.524
The truth isn't gonna change

04:17.524 --> 04:19.298
no matter how many times you ask.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.099
But no one can corroborate your story.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.784
You claim you fell asleep
while writing a paper.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.536
You claim you didn't know
anything was going on,

04:26.537 --> 04:29.790
but something isn't adding up.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.584
You know we do this for a living, Ben?

04:31.585 --> 04:34.549
We're trained to sniff out bullshit.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.923
I can tell you're hiding something.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.739
So help us help you by coming clean,

04:43.740 --> 04:46.430
and just getting it off your chest.

04:47.650 --> 04:50.349
Okay.

04:50.350 --> 04:53.759
You're right. There...
there is something.

04:58.630 --> 05:02.439
I smoked some weed

05:02.440 --> 05:06.239
to relax so I could write my paper.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.739
I had a little too much
and I fell asleep.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.959
I know I'm not technically
not old enough to buy weed.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.060
That's a level Y offense.
I could be expelled.

05:17.260 --> 05:20.409
But the past few weeks have
been extremely hard for me.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.170
My friend was murdered.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.851
I keep thinking about what
he must've gone through.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.190
Why is he dead and I'm
here talking to you?

05:39.443 --> 05:42.820
That's so messed up.

05:45.908 --> 05:48.739
So if you're gonna arrest
me for drug possession,

05:48.740 --> 05:50.830
arrest me. I don't even care anymore.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.739
Look, no more dope.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.149
Got it?

05:58.150 --> 06:00.005
We'll let it slide this time.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.139
I really hope you find the guy.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.759
_

06:21.800 --> 06:24.539
Ms. Lowe?

06:24.540 --> 06:26.859
And now we have a new development.

06:26.860 --> 06:29.859
In Crime News tonight,
police believe CCTV

06:29.860 --> 06:32.179
from Cooke University may
show the campus killer.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.330
Hey, Ben.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.899
Can you believe they're
still doing these searches?

06:41.900 --> 06:43.729
What do you think they're looking for?

06:43.730 --> 06:45.301
Murder weapons, I guess.

06:45.302 --> 06:48.199
Anything suspicious.
They're desperate, man.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.539
No one's seen an off-Purge
murder in years, let alone two.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.679
Yeah, the NFFA must be freaking out.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.040
Yeah, well, it sucks
for us too 'cause I...

06:58.420 --> 07:00.659
I had to cut a hole in
the tongue of my shoe

07:00.660 --> 07:01.729
to hide my molly.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.859
It was the only way I was
gonna get it off campus

07:04.860 --> 07:06.759
for winter break.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.099
Good thinking.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.559
Sorry they keep bringing you back in

07:09.560 --> 07:12.499
to rehash all this shit,
'cause it must be hard.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.914
I know Andy was your friend.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.335
Yeah, thanks. I'm good though.

07:20.820 --> 07:22.599
Well, if you ever want to talk

07:22.600 --> 07:26.809
or like get plastered you know, I'm...

07:26.810 --> 07:28.119
I'm around.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.559
I'll let you know.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.380
But really, I'm okay.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.728
I should go. Kelen and
I have to get upstate.

07:37.730 --> 07:41.910
- Have a good break, man.
- Yeah, you too.

07:45.820 --> 07:48.863
Olivia, what happened to you?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.700
Maybe the dash cam caught ya.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.789
- Esme.
- Darren.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.959
- Hey.
- I think I have a lead.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.029
Not over the phone. We should meet.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.304
Okay.

08:54.305 --> 08:56.919
The planes need to stay
in the air all night,

08:56.920 --> 08:57.970
so to conserve fuel,

08:57.975 --> 09:00.469
they won't take off
before the Purge sirens.

09:00.470 --> 09:03.339
Doug, you hit this weak spot
we found on the perimeter.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.441
Right before the sirens blow,

09:06.442 --> 09:09.819
I'll activate the jammer, and we roll.

09:09.820 --> 09:12.399
I expected a little more
surprise from you, Ryan.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.899
This is a pretty basic plan.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.199
Well, basic equals safe.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.769
You sure there's not something else

09:18.770 --> 09:20.869
that you're not telling me?

09:20.870 --> 09:24.359
If you don't like the plan, change it.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.296
It's not completely terrible,
but there is one thing.

09:28.297 --> 09:30.249
I knew you'd have notes.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.342
You and Doug can't handle
the guards yourselves.

09:32.343 --> 09:34.385
So I'm gonna pull some strings.

09:34.386 --> 09:37.239
Me and my guys will be working
private security that night.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.839
We'll be the ones guarding the plane.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.039
- Uh, no fucking way.
- Why not?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.659
Because you guys are dirty.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.879
And you three are so squeaky clean.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.749
So instead of splitting it four ways,

09:46.750 --> 09:48.259
we're splitting it, what? Six?

09:48.260 --> 09:49.539
Eight.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.029
How do we know your guys aren't
just gonna hijack the cash?

09:52.030 --> 09:53.419
You don't.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.189
And how do I know you're
not gonna blow me away

09:55.190 --> 09:56.399
once I activate the chamber?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.259
You don't.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.450
Look, I'd be suspicious
if I were in your shoes,

10:01.455 --> 10:02.659
but I didn't get pinched

10:02.660 --> 10:05.439
committing an off-Purge
home invasion, and you did.

10:05.440 --> 10:10.170
Either my guys join or I turn you in.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.379
So what'll it be?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.419
Hey, babe, it's me.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.760
Why is your door locked?

10:58.262 --> 10:59.889
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:05.530 --> 11:07.559
The cops have any news?

11:07.560 --> 11:08.938
No, not really.

11:08.939 --> 11:11.599
I thought they would've
arrested someone by now.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.280
Yeah, me too.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.639
Meg and Bonnie were
supposed to stay in town

11:16.640 --> 11:20.080
for the holidays, but now
everyone's too freaked out.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.708
I'm so lucky to be staying with you.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.079
I'll keep you safe.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.880
Look, I believe that you're sorry.

11:36.884 --> 11:39.553
And I believe you would
take it back if you could.

11:39.554 --> 11:41.339
Thank you for saying that.

11:41.340 --> 11:45.509
But you can't, because it's done,

11:45.510 --> 11:49.639
and when I see you, I see you with him.

11:49.640 --> 11:54.280
And I... I wish...

11:56.380 --> 11:59.219
I wish I didn't.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.539
Me too.

12:00.540 --> 12:03.493
And on top of all that,
I'm scared for my life here.

12:03.494 --> 12:06.369
- I'm working on that.
- Are you?

12:06.370 --> 12:08.099
Michelle, it's been a few weeks.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.379
Why can't you just call him and say,

12:09.380 --> 12:11.629
"Hey, did you put a hit out
on my husband or not?"

12:11.630 --> 12:14.671
Because Sam and I, we didn't
talk that much to begin with.

12:14.672 --> 12:16.219
So what, it was just fucking then?

12:16.220 --> 12:17.679
No, that is not what I meant.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.619
Babe, okay, look, I'm
doing everything I can

12:20.620 --> 12:24.009
to fix this without making things worse.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.459
He tried to Purge you.

12:25.460 --> 12:28.519
He is obviously not a rational man.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.274
Are we expecting somebody?

12:36.320 --> 12:40.519
I used your phone to text him
and ask him to come over.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.819
Wait, what?

12:43.820 --> 12:47.199
He is not gonna react well to this.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.989
Babe, you should've told me.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.129
Can you get the door?

13:18.730 --> 13:20.359
Hello, Sam.

13:20.360 --> 13:25.241
Hey. Uh, you remember April, my wife?

13:25.242 --> 13:28.411
How can I forget?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.439
Uh, so, we were just...

13:32.440 --> 13:34.580
Hi.

13:34.585 --> 13:37.962
Why don't you guys come in?

13:37.963 --> 13:40.829
Yeah.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.619
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.488
Why'd you want to meet?

14:05.741 --> 14:08.619
Are you okay?

14:24.810 --> 14:28.514
So, uh, what's the plan?

14:30.090 --> 14:31.850
Are you gonna follow up on that lead?

14:33.020 --> 14:36.729
Nah, I don't think that's
gonna pan out after all.

14:36.730 --> 14:38.689
When do you want to meet again?

14:38.690 --> 14:40.339
I probably won't see you again.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.568
I'm getting out of the city.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.359
Okay, great.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.287
Great. Thanks for the cash.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.816
Hey, watch it!

15:47.560 --> 15:50.910
Somebody tell me we have
a shot of her up ahead.

15:54.630 --> 15:57.060
Everyone, look at me.

15:58.312 --> 16:00.599
I know this is hard for you.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.799
It's hard for me too.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.234
We worked side by side with Esme.

16:05.235 --> 16:07.139
She was part of our family,

16:07.140 --> 16:09.279
but she has been making
moves against the NFFA

16:09.280 --> 16:11.400
for quite some time.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.160
She fooled all of us.

16:14.180 --> 16:17.019
But she has committed an act of treason,

16:17.020 --> 16:19.819
and now it is our job
to protect this country

16:19.820 --> 16:21.499
by catching her.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.659
Priority access granted.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.620
You hear that?

16:25.630 --> 16:27.619
The bosses have given
us temporary access

16:27.620 --> 16:29.259
to private cell phone cameras.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.840
This is a priority one manhunt.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.149
Broken.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.900
_

17:10.960 --> 17:12.799
Got her.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.762
She'll come out on the
opposite block any second now.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.229
Where is she?

17:24.260 --> 17:26.439
Come on, people, she knows
all of our blind spots.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.810
We have to anticipate her next move.

18:27.950 --> 18:29.379
_

18:29.380 --> 18:31.099
What you got?

18:31.100 --> 18:33.089
Uh, cell phone hit.

18:33.090 --> 18:36.279
Facial recog must've caught it
once it uploaded to the Cloud.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.299
We've got a location on the suspect.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.780
Send that to all units now.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.219
Is this Brie?

19:18.220 --> 19:20.259
Uh, no. Camembert.

19:28.230 --> 19:32.359
So Sam and I, we've been
doing a lot of soul searching.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.479
Done a lot of therapy.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.572
And just so there's no surprises,

19:38.573 --> 19:40.019
I know everything that's happened

19:40.020 --> 19:41.201
between you and my husband.

19:41.202 --> 19:43.019
It's taken some time,

19:43.020 --> 19:45.939
but I think I've come to
terms with everything,

19:45.940 --> 19:47.829
and I'm just ready to move forward.

19:47.830 --> 19:49.559
When Michelle texted me,

19:49.560 --> 19:52.120
we thought that we should get together

19:52.129 --> 19:55.589
face-to-face and, uh, work this out.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.759
We know a really great
therapist if you're interested.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.722
I sent the text, not Michelle.

20:03.950 --> 20:07.749
Okay, okay. That's not what I expected.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.479
Sam, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.349
No, wait, I mean, you guys
wanted to talk, right?

20:12.350 --> 20:15.059
So we should talk. Get
everything on the table,

20:15.060 --> 20:17.759
be brutally honest with one another.

20:17.760 --> 20:22.283
So Sam, are you sure you
told your wife everything?

20:39.910 --> 20:41.129
NFFA! Open up!

20:45.090 --> 20:47.389
NFFA! Open up!

20:53.260 --> 20:55.429
Can I help you?

20:55.430 --> 20:58.099
This is the NFFA, Mr. Grant.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.155
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.280
What do you want?

21:19.860 --> 21:22.803
I have some questions
for you, Mr. Grant.

21:29.300 --> 21:32.609
Anything you want to tell us?

21:32.610 --> 21:35.759
You know, my wife must've
been some volcanic fuck

21:35.760 --> 21:37.900
for you to take a hit out on me.

21:39.750 --> 21:42.399
What is he talking about?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.199
Tell her what you did, Sam.

21:45.620 --> 21:48.279
You know, I've made a lot
of mistakes in my marriage,

21:48.280 --> 21:51.079
but at least I'm no murderer.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.619
Okay, what is going on?

21:53.620 --> 21:55.559
What is he talking about?

21:55.560 --> 21:58.999
Your husband took out a
Purge contract on Marcus.

22:02.884 --> 22:06.239
You said that it didn't mean anything.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.519
What... why would you pay
someone to Purge him

22:08.520 --> 22:09.719
if it didn't mean anything?

22:09.720 --> 22:10.840
I didn't.

22:10.850 --> 22:14.062
I... I don't know what
they're talking about.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.609
_

22:21.610 --> 22:23.919
That's not me. I mean, we don't throw

22:23.920 --> 22:25.359
that kind of money around.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.429
You know that.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.118
I thought the lies were over, Sam.

22:28.119 --> 22:30.280
Honey, I'm not lying.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.371
I'm done.

22:32.372 --> 22:34.939
- You figure this out.
- Honey, wait.

22:34.940 --> 22:36.479
No. Uh-uh.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.254
Nobody's going anywhere
until we sort this thing out.

22:39.255 --> 22:41.669
Please... please don't.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.319
Come on, man.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.129
- Put the gun away.
- Marcus, be careful.

22:46.130 --> 22:49.319
I have to.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.391
I can't live with this over my head.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.720
Okay.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.129
I'll get the duct tape.

23:03.069 --> 23:07.379
- Am I under arrest?
- This is just a routine sweep.

23:07.380 --> 23:10.070
Right, but you seem a little edgy.

23:11.550 --> 23:14.109
NFFA. Open up.

23:14.110 --> 23:16.291
- Friends of yours?
- I need your help.

23:19.377 --> 23:22.019
Why would I help you?

23:22.020 --> 23:23.719
You think they'll just arrest me

23:23.720 --> 23:27.239
without wondering why I
showed up on your doorstep?

23:27.240 --> 23:29.159
I haven't done anything illegal.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.099
You'll be on their radar forever.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.889
One false move and...

23:32.890 --> 23:34.089
I'll take my chances.

23:34.090 --> 23:38.099
Please, I'm a good person.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.139
I haven't done anything wrong.
I don't deserve this.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.599
Welcome to the club.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.400
- Coming!
- No.

23:45.403 --> 23:47.369
They'll be able to see
that I tracked you down

23:47.370 --> 23:48.657
earlier this year.

23:49.940 --> 23:51.949
I'll lie.

23:51.950 --> 23:55.699
I'll tell them you helped
me, that this was planned.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.623
This is the NFFA.

23:57.624 --> 24:00.899
They'll burn every potential
leak to the ground.

24:00.900 --> 24:04.279
No probable cause, no proper trial.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.620
You know that's true.

24:05.630 --> 24:07.629
We both know it.

24:07.630 --> 24:10.302
What happened to being a good person?

24:10.303 --> 24:13.890
I'm desperate.

24:16.059 --> 24:18.390
Oh!

24:19.980 --> 24:22.260
Oh, I've missed you.

24:23.780 --> 24:25.400
Mom, this is Kelen.

24:25.402 --> 24:28.278
Hi, Mrs. Gardner.
Thank you for having me.

24:28.279 --> 24:29.569
Absolutely.

24:29.570 --> 24:32.032
I was so happy when Ben
said you'd be coming too.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.519
It'll be nice to have a little
feminine energy around here.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.059
Holy shit, Lil' B is back!

24:37.060 --> 24:39.499
Ow! What's up, baby?

24:39.500 --> 24:42.489
And he brought a real,
live girl with him too.

24:42.490 --> 24:43.500
Nice!

24:43.503 --> 24:45.129
Hi, Kelen.

24:45.130 --> 24:48.499
I'm Logan, the handsomer, older,

24:48.500 --> 24:50.674
more mature of the Gardner brothers.

24:50.675 --> 24:52.080
That's not saying much.

24:53.510 --> 24:55.489
We have a warrant to
search for a fugitive

24:55.490 --> 24:57.179
who was last seen in your area.

24:57.180 --> 24:58.767
Be my guest.

24:58.768 --> 25:01.979
Have you seen this woman?

25:01.980 --> 25:04.649
I've been inside working
on my bike all day.

25:04.650 --> 25:06.519
What'd she do anyway?

25:06.520 --> 25:08.699
Classified.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.362
Isn't it always?

25:24.460 --> 25:27.469
Interesting place you got here.

25:27.470 --> 25:29.620
I like it.

25:31.176 --> 25:33.511
We're all clear.

25:34.420 --> 25:36.619
Thank you for your time, Mr. Dixon.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.289
If you see anything, give us a call.

25:38.290 --> 25:40.340
You got it.

26:03.310 --> 26:05.659
I don't know how to thank you.

26:05.660 --> 26:06.959
Well, you can start...

26:06.960 --> 26:09.479
What the hell?

26:09.480 --> 26:12.257
By telling me the truth.

26:14.830 --> 26:17.929
Maybe you should go

26:17.930 --> 26:21.599
'cause if this goes south
and the cops get involved,

26:21.600 --> 26:26.099
you could just tell them
that I pressured you.

26:27.380 --> 26:31.969
Look, what happened on Purge,
it was all because of me.

26:31.970 --> 26:33.904
We're committed now.

26:33.905 --> 26:36.179
We can't back off no matter what

26:36.180 --> 26:37.659
or you're dead next Purge.

26:52.190 --> 26:54.639
I'm gonna take this off so we can talk,

26:54.640 --> 26:56.659
but don't do anything stupid.

27:03.020 --> 27:06.379
- Say when.
- Just leftover turkey?

27:06.380 --> 27:08.559
Oh, it's Ben's favorite.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.939
Whatever Little Benny
wants, Little Benny gets.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.079
He tell you how everyone
used to call him that?

27:14.080 --> 27:16.099
Little Benny?

27:17.115 --> 27:19.779
So Logan, what do you do for work?

27:19.780 --> 27:21.599
Oh, he graduated from Louisiana State

27:21.600 --> 27:23.413
- two years ago.
- That's awesome.

27:23.414 --> 27:25.919
Yeah, a lot of good it's doing me.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.919
Five figures of debt, shit credit,

27:27.920 --> 27:29.199
a part-time gig mowing lawns.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.419
So... that's what you guys
get to look forward to.

27:32.420 --> 27:35.499
Hey, you had a great
interview this past week.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.459
For a loading dock job. When
you have an Econ degree,

27:37.460 --> 27:38.649
it's not really a great interview.

27:38.650 --> 27:40.699
But thank you, Mom, that's very sweet.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.840
Thank you.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.727
So the Campus Killer is going viral, yo!

27:46.728 --> 27:49.021
What's it like going to
school with a maniac?

27:49.022 --> 27:50.979
Logan.

27:50.980 --> 27:53.159
That's the last thing Ben and Kelen

27:53.160 --> 27:54.809
want to think about right now.

27:54.810 --> 27:55.939
Yeah, shut up.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.219
Coward doesn't even have the decency

27:59.220 --> 28:01.700
to wait for the Purge, does he?

28:01.701 --> 28:03.559
Hunting on a college campus...

28:03.560 --> 28:05.199
like shooting fish in a barrel.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.819
Hey, my friend was murdered.
Can we not talk about this

28:06.820 --> 28:08.589
at the dinner table, please?

28:08.590 --> 28:09.917
I agree.

28:09.918 --> 28:12.539
Kelen, what are you studying?

28:12.540 --> 28:13.919
Art history.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.929
Ooh!

28:14.930 --> 28:16.840
I know it's not very practical,

28:16.841 --> 28:18.939
but I love it.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.133
I know what would happen

28:20.134 --> 28:22.179
if Ben came face-to-face
with this killer.

28:22.180 --> 28:25.749
He once fainted when he
watched Mom get a flu shot.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.679
Just...

28:27.680 --> 28:30.520
remember that?

28:30.521 --> 28:32.349
Ben was one of those kids
who sucked his thumb

28:32.350 --> 28:34.119
until he was, like, ten.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.484
Mom tried bribing him.

28:35.485 --> 28:38.219
Eventually they had to get
this, like, special glove

28:38.220 --> 28:39.238
and they put this bitter...

28:39.239 --> 28:40.406
Fuck off!

28:41.491 --> 28:43.659
I'd love to see what the
Campus Killer would do to you.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.949
Ben.

28:56.280 --> 29:00.340
I'm just saying... shut up about it.

29:01.410 --> 29:04.055
You don't know what
it's like living in fear.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.350
I know that you put a hit out on me.

29:13.356 --> 29:15.599
This is all a big mistake.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.879
Come on, Sam!

29:16.880 --> 29:19.236
You went to my old
neighborhood asking about me.

29:19.237 --> 29:20.339
That's crazy.

29:20.340 --> 29:22.159
I... I don't even know
where you're from.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.866
My ex-wife, she saw you there.

29:23.867 --> 29:26.949
That's not true. He... he's insane.

29:26.950 --> 29:29.520
Why don't you tell him
the truth, Michelle?

29:29.539 --> 29:32.749
Tell me what?

29:32.750 --> 29:35.399
She's the one who wanted to Purge you.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.699
- She told me.
- Oh, fuck you, Sam.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.459
That was nothing, and you know it.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.551
- Hey, what was nothing?
- Huh?

29:42.552 --> 29:44.489
- Oh, my God.
- What was nothing?

29:44.490 --> 29:46.199
- What was nothing?
- It was nothing.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.289
I forgot about it until
he just bought it up.

29:48.290 --> 29:50.019
What the fuck is he talking about?

29:50.020 --> 29:52.339
You have to believe me.
It was a dumb joke.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.739
We were in bed together, Marcus.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.459
- Fuck you! Shut up!
- She was complaining about you

29:56.460 --> 29:58.059
and she suggested Purging you.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.859
Oh, my God! That's bullshit!

29:59.860 --> 30:01.679
No, he was complaining, okay?

30:01.680 --> 30:03.439
And I said it as a joke.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.730
Michelle, what did you say exactly?

30:07.860 --> 30:12.559
I said, "If he bothers you so much,

30:12.560 --> 30:14.249
"then maybe you should quit complaining

30:14.250 --> 30:15.999
and do something about it."

30:16.000 --> 30:19.259
And he said, "You mean Purge him?"

30:19.260 --> 30:23.300
And I laughed, because
it was a stupid joke.

30:25.660 --> 30:29.059
Baby, come on. He is
lying to get out of this.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.679
You have to see that.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.079
It was a shitty thing
to even talk about,

30:33.080 --> 30:36.059
- but I mean it.
- She's lying, Marcus,

30:36.060 --> 30:38.565
just like your ex-wife was
lying about seeing me.

30:38.566 --> 30:40.609
She's playing you like a fiddle.

30:40.610 --> 30:41.800
Shut up!

30:45.120 --> 30:46.560
Don't talk!

30:46.580 --> 30:48.909
Just come here... Don't talk!

30:52.140 --> 30:54.122
- Huh?!
- Aah!

30:54.123 --> 30:56.039
Hey, admit what you did!

30:56.040 --> 30:58.539
I didn't do it! I told you it was her!

31:00.963 --> 31:03.340
Just admit it, Sam!

31:05.640 --> 31:07.427
Okay, fine! I did it!

31:07.428 --> 31:09.389
I took out the hit! Please, just stop!

31:09.390 --> 31:11.389
Please!

31:26.730 --> 31:29.229
Do you love her?

31:29.230 --> 31:31.120
Of course not.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.329
But you're willing to Purge for her.

31:42.110 --> 31:46.300
You can make it up by
taking that hit down.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.989
What I did was perfectly legal.

31:50.990 --> 31:55.359
That's right, but you
know, it's my right

31:55.360 --> 31:57.769
to Purge you too.

31:59.930 --> 32:03.269
And if you tell anybody about
what happened here tonight,

32:03.270 --> 32:05.769
I'll put a hit out on you,

32:05.770 --> 32:09.220
your wife, and your entire family.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.239
And nothing you do will
be able to stop me.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.879
And if they don't get you this year,

32:14.880 --> 32:17.279
they're gonna keep
coming again and again

32:17.280 --> 32:21.039
until everybody's Purged.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.859
Now we can either live
together or die together.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.229
It's your choice.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.859
So you think you can take down the NFFA?

32:31.860 --> 32:33.929
They're killing innocent
people off-Purge,

32:33.930 --> 32:35.219
and I think I found proof.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.069
Jesus.

32:38.070 --> 32:40.909
Well, then you better get
the hell out of the country.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.459
Eat.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.479
If you're on the run,

32:43.480 --> 32:45.639
you'll never know when
your next meal is gonna be.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.359
Sorry I threatened you.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.569
I just didn't know what else to do.

32:50.570 --> 32:52.979
You really think I'm gonna help you?

32:52.980 --> 32:55.785
This was not my plan A,

32:55.786 --> 32:58.659
but I think you're a good person.

32:58.660 --> 33:02.179
You care about people and
want to do right by them.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.129
At least you used to.

33:05.130 --> 33:08.632
Why don't you tell me how you found me?

33:08.633 --> 33:10.899
Step-by-step.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.679
I watched your habits in
and out of dead zones.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.469
Like what habits?

33:16.470 --> 33:21.079
You carry a lot of takeout bags,

33:21.080 --> 33:24.079
but never from the same
place twice in a row.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.099
So I tracked all the places you go,

33:26.100 --> 33:28.439
and I figured you lived in-between.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.659
Your rent was likely off-book, in cash.

33:32.660 --> 33:35.339
So an unleased building
with regular utilities,

33:35.340 --> 33:38.299
room for vehicles.

33:38.300 --> 33:41.539
Finally narrowed it
down and staked it out.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.459
You got all that from takeout?

33:46.700 --> 33:49.699
Well, if you're that good, you
can help me find someone else.

33:52.380 --> 33:54.887
This is your way of asking me to stay?

33:54.888 --> 33:57.979
No, it's my way of
allowing you to make up

33:57.980 --> 34:00.499
for having put my life in danger.

34:07.860 --> 34:09.458
What is it?

34:09.460 --> 34:11.819
The NFFA just issued an alert.

34:11.820 --> 34:15.620
"All citizens should be on the
lookout for Esme Carmona."

34:18.100 --> 34:21.038
Looks like you're public
enemy number one.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.410
Better take those muddy shoes
off before you come inside.

36:27.330 --> 36:29.542
Kind of late for a stroll.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.170
Kind of late for tea.

36:35.140 --> 36:38.300
I haven't slept through the
night since your father died.

36:41.780 --> 36:43.379
Do you want a cup?

36:43.380 --> 36:46.267
No, I should get some sleep.

36:50.350 --> 36:53.259
Logan's going through a
tough time right now.

36:53.260 --> 36:56.799
I think he probably misses
that ten-year-old little brother

36:56.800 --> 36:59.899
that used to copy his every move.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.180
Yeah, I guess.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.990
He just gets under my skin.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.751
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.149
When we bottle up our feelings,

37:16.150 --> 37:19.425
they can come out in other
ways that might be scary.

37:23.050 --> 37:25.629
Be careful.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.299
So, Ziv signs our
collective death warrant,

37:35.300 --> 37:37.159
and you decide to go radio silent?

37:37.160 --> 37:39.999
- I got waylaid.
- By what?

37:44.110 --> 37:46.179
That's the chick...

37:46.180 --> 37:48.621
her face is like plastered everywhere.

37:48.622 --> 37:50.538
Are you completely insane?

37:50.539 --> 37:54.293
Sara, Doug, meet Esme.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.421
Newest member of our team.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.393
Please hurry.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.520
_

38:13.550 --> 38:15.809
_

38:15.810 --> 38:16.949
_

38:16.950 --> 38:19.230
There. Done.

38:21.970 --> 38:23.979
- _
- Hey,

38:23.980 --> 38:25.879
you only took 10k down.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.919
I told you to get rid of
the rest of the contract.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.329
What can I say, man? I did my part.

38:31.330 --> 38:34.039
Now what the hell does that mean?

38:34.040 --> 38:38.749
You don't get it. I wasn't the only one.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.620
What?

38:42.280 --> 38:44.370
Take a look around, man.

39:23.910 --> 39:26.479
They all did it.
