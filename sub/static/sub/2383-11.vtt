<i>Kids, in the winter of 2010,</i>

00:02.795 --> 00:05.897
<i>we had a new addition
to our little group-- Zoey.</i>

00:05.898 --> 00:08.366
<i>Zoey was married to...
The Captain.</i>

00:08.367 --> 00:10.768
Boys! Great to see you!

00:10.769 --> 00:11.869
Looking smart.

00:11.870 --> 00:13.738
Have a wonderful time
tonight, okay?

00:13.739 --> 00:16.140
Okay.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.842
That man is terrifying.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.344
Everything he said was nice,
but I am profoundly scared.

00:20.345 --> 00:22.113
Keep smiling.
He can still see us.

00:22.114 --> 00:23.347
(all murmuring)

00:23.348 --> 00:25.283
<i>NARRATOR: There was
just something about him.</i>

00:25.284 --> 00:28.019
<i>We couldn't put
our finger on it until...</i>

00:28.020 --> 00:29.654
I figured it out!

00:30.589 --> 00:32.790
I know what's so creepy
about The Captain.

00:32.791 --> 00:33.724
Okay.

00:35.561 --> 00:36.994
(all scream)
Yeah.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.162
I snapped this
photo of him

00:38.163 --> 00:39.664
last time he dropped off Zoey.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.932
Observe.

00:40.933 --> 00:43.034
The bottom half
of his face... is smiling.

00:43.035 --> 00:44.702
LILY: Oh. Look,
he seems happy.

00:44.703 --> 00:46.904
Seems like a nice guy.

00:46.905 --> 00:48.005
(all murmur happily)

00:48.006 --> 00:50.174
But the top half of his face...

00:50.175 --> 00:50.908
(all gasp)

00:50.909 --> 00:52.109
...wants to murder you!

00:52.110 --> 00:54.111
Cheerful.

00:54.112 --> 00:55.613
(all screaming)
Wants to murder you.

00:55.614 --> 00:57.248
No. Cheerful.

00:57.249 --> 00:58.983
(all scream)
Wants to murder you.

00:58.984 --> 01:01.252
Now, hold on.
Let me ask him a question.

01:01.253 --> 01:04.422
Captain,
what do you think of ice cream?

01:04.423 --> 01:05.756
Oh, he loves it!

01:05.757 --> 01:07.758
Captain, what do you
think of rainy days?

01:07.759 --> 01:10.027
(gasps) Whoa, he hates them.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.530
Captain, quick question:

01:12.531 --> 01:14.398
How do you feel about
the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.

01:14.399 --> 01:15.600
Ooh.
Ooh.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.470
What-What is that?

01:19.471 --> 01:21.172
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

01:21.173 --> 01:23.941
He hates that he loves them.

01:23.942 --> 01:25.309
(all murmur):

01:39.424 --> 01:40.858
Hey, guys, Zoey just told me

01:40.859 --> 01:42.894
about this great Frank Lloyd
Wright retrospective tonight.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.095
Who's in?

01:44.096 --> 01:46.130
Sorry, I'm, uh, I...

01:46.131 --> 01:47.932
I- I don't know,
washing my hair.

01:47.933 --> 01:48.699
Running the water.

01:48.700 --> 01:49.800
Holding the towel.

01:49.801 --> 01:50.935
And I'll be home

01:50.936 --> 01:52.203
trying to get over the fact

01:52.204 --> 01:54.038
that no one invited me
to the big hair washing party.

01:54.039 --> 01:56.340
All right, fine.
Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.

01:56.341 --> 01:58.209
Oh, wait.
Just the two of you?

01:58.210 --> 02:00.111
Tread lightly, Mosby.

02:00.112 --> 02:01.045
Any time

02:01.046 --> 02:02.346
a single guy hangs out

02:02.347 --> 02:03.481
with a married woman,

02:03.482 --> 02:05.283
there are rules
that must be followed.

02:05.284 --> 02:06.951
Rule number one...

02:06.952 --> 02:08.452
Don't use
the husband's condoms.

02:08.453 --> 02:10.086
That's just rude.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.657
Rule number one:

02:12.658 --> 02:15.593
don't go anywhere
that has candles.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.962
Excuse me, Captain,
how do you feel

02:17.963 --> 02:20.998
about Ted and Zoey having
an intimate chat by candlelight?

02:20.999 --> 02:22.166
Mm-hmm...

02:22.167 --> 02:23.301
(yelling)

02:23.302 --> 02:25.636
It'll be the last dinner
they ever have.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.939
Rule number two:

02:27.940 --> 02:29.373
No sharing food.
Hmm.

02:29.374 --> 02:31.943
In fact, anything involving
saliva is off-limits.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.578
Toothbrushes,
thermometers, lipstick.

02:34.579 --> 02:35.746
Well, if I can't share
her lipstick,

02:35.747 --> 02:36.881
there's really no point
in even going.

02:36.882 --> 02:39.450
And the most
important rule of all...

02:39.451 --> 02:42.119
Lubricant is public
property. (Robin groans)

02:42.120 --> 02:42.853
Please.

02:42.854 --> 02:44.388
No lying to the spouse

02:44.389 --> 02:46.490
about anything you do.

02:46.491 --> 02:47.625
Why would anyone lie?

02:47.626 --> 02:48.759
Look, Zoey and I
are just friends.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.061
If there was anything more
than that,

02:50.062 --> 02:51.262
I wouldn't hang out with her.

02:51.263 --> 02:53.164
Lily's right, Ted.
Once you're married,

02:53.165 --> 02:54.498
it's very hard to be friends

02:54.499 --> 02:57.034
with a single person of the
opposite sex. ROBIN: Yeah.

02:57.035 --> 02:58.502
Unless you're old friends,
which is why

02:58.503 --> 03:00.504
I can hang out
with Marshall whenever I want.

03:00.505 --> 03:01.605
Right, Marsh Madness?

03:01.606 --> 03:02.974
No doubt, Robo Cop.

03:04.343 --> 03:05.743
You two never hang out alone.

03:05.744 --> 03:07.712
You just made up those nicknames
right now.

03:07.713 --> 03:08.980
I guess it's true.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.148
You and I never really
hang out alone.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.718
Well, let's. Let's have dinner
together, just the two of us.

03:13.719 --> 03:14.986
Oh! Sweet.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.921
No candles.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.990
BOTH:
No candles.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.125
Lily, I guess that leaves
just you and me. Want to hang?

03:21.126 --> 03:23.160
<i>NARRATOR: And then Lily
said something to Barney</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:25.129
<i>that insulted every fiber
of his being.</i>

03:25.130 --> 03:26.564
Nah.

03:26.565 --> 03:28.065
(gasps)

03:28.066 --> 03:30.534
<i>NARRATOR: Wait. No. It had
to be more than just, "Nah."</i>

03:30.535 --> 03:31.669
<i>Oh, I think she said...</i>

03:31.670 --> 03:35.906
You're a big...
stupid octopus head!

03:35.907 --> 03:37.108
(gasps)

03:37.109 --> 03:38.542
<i>NARRATOR:
No, that doesn't make sense.</i>

03:38.543 --> 03:41.145
<i>Okay, hang on.
What did she say?</i>

03:41.146 --> 03:45.916
<i>She said, um, uh...</i>

03:45.917 --> 03:48.819
<i>To be honest kids, I'm having
a little trouble remembering</i>

03:48.820 --> 03:50.521
<i>exactly what their fight
was about.</i>

03:50.522 --> 03:52.156
<i>Hey, it was 20 years ago!</i>

03:52.157 --> 03:53.324
<i>I'll remember.</i>

03:53.325 --> 03:54.759
<i>Anyway, the next night...</i>

03:54.760 --> 03:57.228
Well, Lily,
you were right.

03:57.229 --> 04:00.531
Something weird happened
with Zoey last night.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.834
(phone plays "Anchors Aweigh")
Oh, that's the Captain.

04:03.835 --> 04:05.703
Yes, I call my husband
The Captain,

04:05.704 --> 04:08.906
but that is the only concession
I make to his seafaring ways.

04:08.907 --> 04:10.341
Hang on.

04:10.342 --> 04:11.709
Ahoy.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.445
I'm just out with friends.

04:14.446 --> 04:16.313
Friends. Plural.

04:16.314 --> 04:18.548
Like-Like there was more
than one of me.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.784
Ew! Ew!

04:19.785 --> 04:22.553
She lied
to her husband? Uh-oh.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.355
So, what did you do?

04:24.356 --> 04:27.792
Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say
you were out with friends?

04:27.793 --> 04:29.927
Yeah. The Captain's
on his way home from Milan.

04:29.928 --> 04:31.595
He can get a little jealous
sometimes,

04:31.596 --> 04:33.697
so I didn't want
to make him worry.

04:34.533 --> 04:35.499
Is that okay?

04:35.500 --> 04:37.368
It's totally okay.

04:37.369 --> 04:39.737
It's not okay! I didn't
really think it was okay!

04:39.738 --> 04:42.373
Pur-leez! You lie to
your husband all the time.

04:42.374 --> 04:44.642
"Uh, uh, that shirt
looks great on you""

04:44.643 --> 04:46.444
"I love your mom""

04:46.445 --> 04:48.879
"I never fantasize about
Barney when we're doing it""

04:48.880 --> 04:51.415
Sound familiar, Pinocchio?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.683
(scoffs)

04:52.684 --> 04:53.884
What's wrong
with this shirt?

04:53.885 --> 04:56.053
TED:
Lily, ruling.

04:56.054 --> 04:57.388
Do I have to stop

04:57.389 --> 04:58.923
hanging out with Zoey?

04:58.924 --> 05:01.025
No, you just need
to spend time

05:01.026 --> 05:03.094
with her
and The Captain together.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.929
If you're friends
with the both of them,

05:04.930 --> 05:06.363
then there's not a problem.

05:06.364 --> 05:08.766
Actually, I do have a standing
invitation from The Captain

05:08.767 --> 05:11.235
to go for a ride with them
on his boat.

05:11.236 --> 05:14.238
Great. So go make nice
with Captain Creepy,

05:14.239 --> 05:15.439
and problem solved.

05:37.863 --> 05:40.931
Yeah. Nail-biter.

Mm.

something, and for

Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

06:41.126 --> 06:42.626

sensitive lately.

she's feeling a little
under the weather.

you, me

and six hours
in frigid international waters.

hang out with some... witnesses.

boring poetry class in college.

08:34.052 --> 08:35.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:35.385 --> 08:38.288
You were just thinking that
this dinner is really boring.

08:38.289 --> 08:41.124
That's what made you think of
your boring class in college.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.159
What?! What? No! No!
No, no, no.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.695
Marshall, no. No. I...

08:44.696 --> 08:48.799
<i>I just saw that board
of specials, and I thought,</i>

08:48.800 --> 08:50.500
you know what sucks?

08:50.501 --> 08:51.735
Being bored.

08:51.736 --> 08:52.903
Which I am not.

08:52.904 --> 08:58.075
So that clears that... right up.

08:58.076 --> 08:59.443
Robin, I'm an attorney.

08:59.444 --> 09:00.611
(sighs)

09:00.612 --> 09:02.145
Fine. This night's
a little awkward.

09:02.146 --> 09:04.982
I guess it's 'cause we never
hang out alone together.

09:04.983 --> 09:06.083
Why is that?

09:06.084 --> 09:08.418
It's 'cause
of The Mermaid Theory.

09:08.419 --> 09:13.056
<i>Two years ago, I had just hired
a new assistant at GNB.</i>

09:15.426 --> 09:18.528
So, who's the eye broccoli?

09:18.529 --> 09:20.897
Okay, that's Iris,
my new assistant.

09:20.898 --> 09:23.066
And yes, she's a little plain,

09:23.067 --> 09:25.869
but I'm married, so that's good.

09:25.870 --> 09:27.204
Mark my words, Marshall.

09:27.205 --> 09:30.173
Someday you will find Iris
so excruciatingly attractive,

09:30.174 --> 09:33.844
you won't be able to look her
directly in the boobs.

09:37.515 --> 09:40.450
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

09:40.451 --> 09:43.987
Marshall, do you know how
the myth of mermaids came to be?

09:43.988 --> 09:45.455
I'm sorry. Myth?

09:45.456 --> 09:47.824
It was 300 years ago.

09:47.825 --> 09:50.594
<i>Sailors stuck at sea
would get desperate</i>

09:50.595 --> 09:51.895
<i>for female companionship.</i>

09:51.896 --> 09:55.599
<i>It got so bad
that, eventually,</i>

09:55.600 --> 09:59.403
<i>the manatees out in the water
started to look like...</i>

09:59.404 --> 10:01.538
<i>beautiful women.</i>

10:01.539 --> 10:04.975
<i>Mermaids.</i>

10:06.811 --> 10:08.979
Let's go get some tail!

10:10.815 --> 10:12.983
Oh.

10:14.319 --> 10:18.422
You see, every woman, no matter
how initially repugnant,

10:18.423 --> 10:21.458
has a mermaid clock--
the time it takes

10:21.459 --> 10:24.127
for you to realize
you want to bone her.

10:24.128 --> 10:27.097
Sure, today you see Iris
as a manatee.

10:27.098 --> 10:29.299
But she ain't gonna
stay that way.

10:29.300 --> 10:34.838
Marshall, your secretary's
mermaid clock starts right now.

10:34.839 --> 10:36.406
(clock ticking)

10:36.407 --> 10:39.276
<i>MARSHALL: And it took one year,
three months, and 16 days,</i>

10:39.277 --> 10:41.378
<i>but eventually...</i>

10:41.379 --> 10:43.213
(alarm bell dings)

10:48.820 --> 10:50.354
(panting)

10:50.355 --> 10:51.722
D'oh!

10:51.723 --> 10:53.423
Told you.

10:53.424 --> 10:55.092
The Mermaid Theory.

10:55.093 --> 10:56.259
It's a thing.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.928
You owe me 500 bucks.

10:57.929 --> 10:59.162
Did we bet on this?

10:59.163 --> 11:01.198
Let's say yes.

11:01.199 --> 11:04.101
And that's why we never
hang out alone? Yes.

11:04.102 --> 11:06.870
As Lily's best friend, you are
the last person on the planet

11:06.871 --> 11:08.505
o's allowed
to turn into a mermaid.

11:08.506 --> 11:09.673
Wait, does that mean

11:09.674 --> 11:11.608
that I'm a manatee right now?

11:14.045 --> 11:16.346
Big-time manatee.

11:16.347 --> 11:19.850
What were those
sailors thinking?

11:19.851 --> 11:22.986
Huh. I don't know.

11:22.987 --> 11:27.124
Being out at sea can do
crazy things to a man.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.993
Vast, the sea.

11:29.994 --> 11:32.028
Deep.

11:32.029 --> 11:34.264
Endless.

11:34.265 --> 11:37.667
Going around for miles.

11:37.668 --> 11:42.305
You could scream and scream,
and not a soul would hear you.

11:43.274 --> 11:45.342
Listen to this.

11:45.343 --> 11:46.510
(screams)

11:46.511 --> 11:47.677
Help!

11:47.678 --> 11:49.346
Somebody help me!

11:49.347 --> 11:52.082
I'm trapped on a boat
with a madman!

11:52.083 --> 11:53.717
Help!

11:56.053 --> 11:58.388
See? Nothing.

11:58.389 --> 12:00.257
(laughing)

12:00.258 --> 12:02.759
(both laughing)

12:02.760 --> 12:04.661
<i>(anxious laugh)
He's gonna kill me.</i>

12:04.662 --> 12:05.962
<i>Okay, calm down, Teddy.</i>

12:05.963 --> 12:07.230
<i>He's not jealous.</i>

12:07.231 --> 12:09.232
He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.534
So, Ted,

12:10.535 --> 12:15.372
I noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with Zoey.

12:15.373 --> 12:18.508
<i>(terrified scream)</i>

12:18.509 --> 12:20.477
<i>NARRATOR:
Okay, back to Barney and Lily</i>

12:20.478 --> 12:22.512
<i>and whatever the hell
they were fighting about.</i>

12:22.513 --> 12:25.315
Seriously? I step away for
five seconds, and you eat

12:25.316 --> 12:26.817
all my onion rings?

12:27.418 --> 12:29.352
No surprise there.

12:29.353 --> 12:31.087
What's that supposed to mean?

12:31.088 --> 12:33.590
Are you calling me fat?

12:34.425 --> 12:36.359
If there is one thing
you never do,

12:36.360 --> 12:39.463
it is call a woman fat
right to her face!

12:39.464 --> 12:41.531
<i>Wait. Barney's not a woman.</i>

12:41.532 --> 12:44.734
<i>That's right--
Barney wasn't hurt by Lily,</i>

12:44.735 --> 12:47.838
<i>Lily was hurt by Barney.</i>

12:47.839 --> 12:48.905
Want to hang?

12:48.906 --> 12:50.740
Nah.
(gasps)

12:50.741 --> 12:53.643
Watch out!
(gasps)

12:53.644 --> 12:55.378
(panting)

12:55.379 --> 12:58.114
Wow... thanks, Barney.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.817
You saved me.

13:00.818 --> 13:02.385
You saved us.

13:02.386 --> 13:04.754
If there's one thing
you never do,

13:04.755 --> 13:07.624
it's call a woman fat
right to her face!

13:07.625 --> 13:09.726
<i>Okay, now I'm on track.</i>

13:09.727 --> 13:12.162
<i>The rest of this story
should make perfect sense.</i>

13:12.163 --> 13:13.697
Oh, Lily, I'm sorry.

13:13.698 --> 13:15.999
Hey, you want
to see a magic trick?

13:19.504 --> 13:20.470
(eerie whirring)

13:20.471 --> 13:22.372
You're a jerk.

13:22.373 --> 13:24.241
<i>Okay, that makes no sense.</i>

13:24.242 --> 13:26.309
<i>Kids, I'm officially
admitting defeat.</i>

13:26.310 --> 13:28.512
<i>I will never
remember this story.</i>

13:28.513 --> 13:31.014
<i>I'm sorry
for wasting your time.</i>

13:31.015 --> 13:33.650
Ted, let me show you
my harpoon collection.

13:33.651 --> 13:35.819
Just gonna make a quick call.

13:35.820 --> 13:37.087
Hey, silly question.

13:37.088 --> 13:39.189
What are our exact
nautical coordinates?

13:39.190 --> 13:40.824
How now?

13:40.825 --> 13:42.859
Oh, bother.

13:44.529 --> 13:46.062
(sighs) Well...

13:46.063 --> 13:48.398
she's a goner.

13:49.634 --> 13:52.335
By now, the icy tide
has already dropped

13:52.336 --> 13:55.539
its core temperature
to near freezing.

13:55.540 --> 13:58.108
And down it goes.

13:58.109 --> 14:00.310
Now it's at 50 meters.

14:00.311 --> 14:03.780
Complete crushing blackness.

14:03.781 --> 14:05.482
100 meters.

14:05.483 --> 14:07.183
The pressure is so intense,

14:07.184 --> 14:10.153
the keys are popping
right out of its head.

14:10.154 --> 14:12.756
Head?
200 meters.

14:12.757 --> 14:16.293
No one will ever find
its mangled remains,

14:16.294 --> 14:18.728
save for the crustacea

14:18.729 --> 14:22.332
that feed off
its lifeless husk.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.434
Can you hear me now?

14:24.435 --> 14:28.838
No. Because you're
on the bottom of the sea.

14:29.907 --> 14:32.576
Well, I got a big
morning, so...

14:32.577 --> 14:35.378
Dry cleaners, bank, you
know, so... Ted, it's time.

14:35.379 --> 14:36.580
(whimpers)

14:36.581 --> 14:38.815
I have something
for you.

14:38.816 --> 14:40.650
Wait here.

14:44.121 --> 14:46.556
<i>Okay, you got to swim
for it, Mosby.</i>

14:46.557 --> 14:48.391
<i>Man versus sea.</i>

14:48.392 --> 14:49.526
<i>You can do this.</i>

14:49.527 --> 14:51.127
<i>You didn't get
a "Good Effort" ribbon</i>

14:51.128 --> 14:52.696
<i>from the Shaker Heights
JCC Swim Camp</i>

14:52.697 --> 14:54.598
<i>because you don't
have what it takes.</i>

14:54.599 --> 14:55.932
Found it.

14:55.933 --> 14:56.967
Zoey told me

14:56.968 --> 14:58.802
you're a scotch drinker.

14:58.803 --> 15:01.471
I bought this special
for tonight.

15:01.472 --> 15:04.074
<i>And just as I started
to realize that maybe</i>

15:04.075 --> 15:06.810
<i>I wasn't in danger after all,
we hit a bump.</i>

15:06.811 --> 15:08.411
Whoa!

15:08.412 --> 15:10.013
(splash)

15:10.014 --> 15:12.048
Ted?

15:14.490 --> 15:17.058
that if you spend

15:17.059 --> 15:19.594
too much time alone with me,
I'll turn into a mermaid?

15:19.595 --> 15:22.564
Yes. I mean, sure, right now,
you're bald and leathery

15:22.565 --> 15:24.532
ancovered in
a thick layer of blubber...

15:24.533 --> 15:26.167
Am I blushing or...?

15:26.168 --> 15:29.370
...but at some point, my stupid
male brain will transform you

15:29.371 --> 15:33.174
into a foxy fish-babe singin'

15:33.175 --> 15:35.276
"Part of Your World"
to my pants.

15:35.277 --> 15:39.113
Okay, even if that happens, is
there any way to un-mermaid me?

15:39.114 --> 15:41.049
I asked Barney the same thing.

15:44.353 --> 15:46.287
Once mermaid-ified,
there's only one way

15:46.288 --> 15:48.923
a woman can go back to being
unattractive again,

15:48.924 --> 15:50.725
but it's pretty gruesome.

15:50.726 --> 15:52.227
Death?

15:52.228 --> 15:54.662
Worse. Pregnancy.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.664
If a baby's on board that train,

15:56.665 --> 15:59.067
it is headed straight back
to Manatee City...

15:59.068 --> 16:02.003
where the grass ain't green
and the girls ain't pretty.

16:02.438 --> 16:03.538
Pregnancy?

16:03.539 --> 16:05.940
Mm-hmm.
Once a mermaid gets pregnant,

16:05.941 --> 16:08.676
she becomes a manatee again.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.712
Never thought
I'd say that sentence.

16:10.713 --> 16:11.980
<i>Wait! That's it!</i>

16:11.981 --> 16:14.215
That's what Barney and Lily were
fighting about!

16:14.216 --> 16:15.416
The Mermaid Theory!

16:15.417 --> 16:17.652
But their argument didn't happen
at the same time

16:17.653 --> 16:20.788
as all this other stuff.
I'm literally in the wrong year!

16:20.789 --> 16:23.458
It happened much, much later
when Lily was...

16:23.459 --> 16:24.592
<i>pregnant.</i>

16:24.593 --> 16:26.594
Well, Lily, I guess it's
just you and me.

16:26.595 --> 16:27.595
You wanna hang?

16:27.596 --> 16:28.730
Nah.

16:28.731 --> 16:30.031
(gasps)

16:30.032 --> 16:31.232
Whenever we're alone, you spend

16:31.233 --> 16:33.635
the whole time undressing me
with your eyes.

16:33.636 --> 16:35.303
You even take off my shoes.

16:35.304 --> 16:38.406
High heels chafe my shoulders.

16:38.407 --> 16:40.375
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore.

16:40.376 --> 16:42.810
Ever since you got pregnant,
you're just a big fat manatee.

16:42.811 --> 16:44.279
(gasps)

16:44.280 --> 16:47.215
Well, you're a big...

16:47.216 --> 16:49.183
stupid octopus face!

16:49.184 --> 16:53.288
<i>That was it! I remember now!</i>

16:53.289 --> 16:55.890
Wow. Thanks, Barney.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.358
You saved me.

16:58.227 --> 17:01.396
You saved us.

17:01.397 --> 17:04.065
If there's one thing
you never do,

17:04.066 --> 17:06.768
it's call a woman "fat"
right to her face!

17:06.769 --> 17:08.036
I'm sorry, Lily.

17:08.037 --> 17:10.637
Hey, you want to see
a magic trick?

17:14.143 --> 17:14.842
Oh...

17:14.843 --> 17:17.311
You're a jerk.

17:17.313 --> 17:19.714
(Barney chuckles)

17:19.714 --> 17:20.949
Hey. Hey, wait.

17:20.950 --> 17:23.451
Come on. I was kid...
Wait, wait, wait!

17:23.452 --> 17:25.653
There's another addendum
to The Mermaid Theory.

17:25.654 --> 17:28.923
A pregnant woman who's become
a manatee can become

17:28.924 --> 17:30.592
a mermaid again
through one simple act.

17:30.593 --> 17:31.593
What's that?

17:31.594 --> 17:33.861
Breast-feeding. Hot.

17:33.862 --> 17:34.862
Really?

17:34.863 --> 17:36.531
Really.

17:36.532 --> 17:38.866
When those things swell up to
three times their normal size...

17:38.867 --> 17:40.368
so do I.

17:40.369 --> 17:43.071
That's so sweet!

17:44.006 --> 17:46.474
<i>See kids?
Told you I'd get it!</i>

17:46.475 --> 17:50.278
Okay, now we're even!

17:50.279 --> 17:53.247
<i>Yeah, that's the ending
to a whole other story.</i>

17:53.248 --> 17:55.283
<i>We'll get there.</i>

17:55.284 --> 17:57.986
So you really thought
I was gonna kill you?

17:57.987 --> 18:00.622
Well... ish.

18:00.623 --> 18:02.123
Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.393
If I wanted to kill you, I'd
invite you to my hunting lodge.

18:05.394 --> 18:08.329
It's far more remote,
and I wouldn't have

18:08.330 --> 18:12.200
to worry about you turning up in
some nosy fisherman's net.

18:12.201 --> 18:13.534
See? It's stuff like that.

18:13.535 --> 18:15.003
Why-why do you talk that way?

18:15.004 --> 18:17.105
Oh, I'm just jesting for sport.

18:18.774 --> 18:22.410
See, sometimes I don't
bond as well

18:22.411 --> 18:24.312
with Zoey's younger friends.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.914
But I know she really likes you.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.752
I was hoping that maybe
we could be buddies.

18:30.753 --> 18:33.721
We can.

18:33.722 --> 18:35.723
We can be buddies.

18:35.724 --> 18:37.325
Just not on a boat.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.626
Fair enough.

18:38.627 --> 18:39.927
The hunting lodge it is.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.164
Ho-ho-ho!

18:43.165 --> 18:46.200
(slurring): You know, once we
stopped trying to have a conversation

18:46.201 --> 18:48.236
and just focused on
the drinking...

18:48.237 --> 18:49.637
I had fun.

18:49.638 --> 18:50.738
Yeah, me, too.

18:50.739 --> 18:52.640
<i>And then a terrible thing
happened.</i>

18:52.641 --> 18:54.108
<i>Marshall's beer goggles
kicked in</i>

18:54.109 --> 18:56.944
<i>and his very drunk mind started
to see...</i>

18:59.648 --> 19:03.284
No... No, no!

19:03.285 --> 19:04.952
No! No,

19:04.953 --> 19:06.254
don't turn!

19:06.255 --> 19:08.790
Uh-oh.

19:08.791 --> 19:10.625
I don't feel so good.

19:12.127 --> 19:14.962
(vomits)

19:14.963 --> 19:19.133
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
I am, I am so sorry!

19:19.134 --> 19:23.037
Oh! You must think
I'm totally disgusting.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.339
I really do.

19:28.610 --> 19:30.011
<i>And from that moment on</i>

19:30.012 --> 19:31.112
<i>Marshall never worried</i>

19:31.113 --> 19:32.780
<i>about Robin becoming
a mermaid again,</i>

19:32.781 --> 19:35.216
<i>and the two of them were
closer than ever.</i>

19:35.217 --> 19:36.751
There you go.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.219
Hey, Ted.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.654
Hey. You feeling
better?

19:39.655 --> 19:41.989
I have a confession
to make.

19:41.990 --> 19:45.059
I wasn't really sick.

19:45.060 --> 19:45.893
You weren't?

19:45.894 --> 19:46.894
I'm sorry.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.329
I was just feeling guilty

19:48.330 --> 19:50.131
that I lied
to The Captain and...

19:50.132 --> 19:53.601
I don't know, I just thought it
would be good

19:53.602 --> 19:55.636
if you two spent some time
together.

19:55.637 --> 19:56.904
I get it.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.005
And you were right.

19:58.006 --> 19:59.507
He's a nice guy.

19:59.508 --> 20:01.776
I mean, he can be
a little scary.

20:01.777 --> 20:04.979
Yeah, he gets a little murder-y
when he's nervous.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.748
Yeah, he's a creepy dude.

20:07.282 --> 20:08.249
But I like him.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.485
And I just want to make sure

20:10.486 --> 20:12.386
you and I hanging out

20:12.387 --> 20:14.956
doesn't, you know,
cross any lines.

20:14.957 --> 20:16.357
Me, too.

20:16.358 --> 20:19.093
I mean, if either one of us had
even the slightest hint

20:19.094 --> 20:21.562
of feelings for the other,
we shouldn't hang out.

20:21.563 --> 20:23.331
You don't, do you?

20:23.332 --> 20:25.833
No. Do you?

20:25.834 --> 20:27.735
No.

20:28.537 --> 20:30.972
(clock ticking)

20:35.926 --> 20:37.727
Still no sign
of land.

20:37.728 --> 20:41.097
It's been 243 days
since we've seen

20:41.098 --> 20:43.132
another living soul.

20:53.577 --> 20:55.611
What are you looking at?

20:58.515 --> 21:00.783
Dude, we need
to find land.

21:00.784 --> 21:03.486
