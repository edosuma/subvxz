WEBVTT

00:15.198 --> 00:16.338
Pardon me.

00:16.999 --> 00:21.013
Hi! Sorry. I didn't see you there.

00:21.183 --> 00:23.715
Oh, no, no, please never apologize for a kiss, signora.

00:23.855 --> 00:25.767
Especially for one like that

00:28.769 --> 00:30.631
'95 brunello di montalcino.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.163
Great. Decant it, please?

00:33.834 --> 00:34.304
Of course.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.747
Oh, wow. Was that embarrassing.

00:38.047 --> 00:40.309
You heard what the man said. Never apologize.

00:41.620 --> 00:42.851
I'm so happy for you.

00:43.052 --> 00:44.393
I still can't believe it.

00:44.493 --> 00:48.126
Phoebe, I've wanted to buy my granddad's winery ever since he lost it.

00:49.697 --> 00:51.999
I just hope he knows that somehow.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.011
Believe me, he does.

00:54.842 --> 00:56.973
You talk as if you have inside information.

00:57.444 --> 00:58.515
Well, maybe I do.

01:02.419 --> 01:04.260
You are special, Phoebe.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.106
I love you, too.

01:11.277 --> 01:12.808
- I'm sorry?
- Who said that?

01:12.908 --> 01:13.749
Did you say, 'too'?

01:13.849 --> 01:17.822
No. I just said'you' twice. I said "I love you, you". Isn't that...

01:18.153 --> 01:19.824
What I said? Oh, god. Ooh!

01:21.355 --> 01:22.426
Daniel, Table 3.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.922
Ah! It's so--

01:34.247 --> 01:37.589
I'm so sorry to interrupt, but Piper's kind of got a bit of a, um...

01:37.760 --> 01:40.262
a power problem. She kinda needs some more.

01:40.422 --> 01:42.133
Why doesn't she just call the power company?

01:42.364 --> 01:45.306
Tried, and...the line is busy.

01:45.466 --> 01:48.839
So if you could come, like, right now, she'd really love it.

01:48.979 --> 01:52.352
Oh! Oh, please don't use that word. Please don't use that word.

01:52.452 --> 01:55.955
Ok. All right. So, I should go, and we will, you know --

01:56.055 --> 01:56.556
Talk.

01:56.656 --> 01:58.828
Talk! Yeah!

01:59.799 --> 02:03.071
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.775
Sorry! Ok...

02:07.345 --> 02:12.650
Ooh! The stuffed shells. Great choice. Ok. Bye, everyone.

02:25.342 --> 02:26.412
Ok, let's vanquish this demon.

02:28.484 --> 02:30.686
Shh! Something beat us to the punch.

02:33.258 --> 02:34.359
Eew. What is it doing?

02:34.499 --> 02:36.161
Apparently eating the demon.

02:43.477 --> 02:44.678
Or storing it.

02:49.552 --> 02:50.323
What is it?

02:50.453 --> 02:52.965
I don't know. And I don't wanna find out. Let's get outta here.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.087
Paige, do something!

03:07.828 --> 03:09.059
Power lines!

03:20.349 --> 03:21.350
You ok?

03:21.480 --> 03:22.281
Peachy.

03:45.831 --> 03:46.792
Cute.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.672
I still can't believe we vanquished his mommy.

05:42.013 --> 05:45.416
Yeah, but we didn't know it was a mommy,
and besides, mommy tried to kill us.

05:45.546 --> 05:49.890
I know. Still, look at how cute he is. So adorable.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.102
Oh, except when he does that weird little thing with his tongue.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.534
I wonder why he looks so human.

05:55.664 --> 05:58.037
I don't know. But he won't for long.

05:58.677 --> 06:01.580
Ok, Wyatt's upstairs, so at least he's...

06:07.655 --> 06:08.656
...safe.

06:09.096 --> 06:11.198
Don't worry about Wyatt. He's got his protective bubble.

06:11.298 --> 06:12.329
He'll use it if he needs it.

06:12.529 --> 06:15.071
Plus, it looks like he likes his new friend.

06:15.201 --> 06:17.713
That is not a friend. That's a demon.

06:17.814 --> 06:19.175
No, he's just a baby!

06:19.315 --> 06:21.787
'Scuse me. Were you at the same vanquish as me?

06:21.887 --> 06:24.359
Because it took all three of us to stop its mother.

06:24.459 --> 06:26.231
It doesn't mean he's gonna turn out that way.

06:26.331 --> 06:28.192
Paige, he doesn't have a choice. It's genetic.

06:28.293 --> 06:29.233
No, I don't think so.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.105
Okay. Maybe I'm a little biased because I am,

06:31.205 --> 06:35.279
in fact, adopted, but I really think there's something
to the whole nurture versus nature thing and predicting

06:35.379 --> 06:40.083
how a kid is gonna turn out, you know,
the classic environment versus biology argument.

06:40.184 --> 06:42.055
But this is not a child. It's a demon.

06:43.397 --> 06:46.599
Ok. Why don't you go over there
and see if you can sense anything evil.

06:49.302 --> 06:50.102
All right.

06:57.319 --> 06:58.750
Nothing...good or evil.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.562
My point exactly! Clay to be molded.

07:08.018 --> 07:09.519
So you vanquished the demon?

07:09.619 --> 07:11.020
Yes...and no.

07:11.521 --> 07:16.515
Well, the good news is the demon you sent us after is,
in fact, uh...gone.

07:16.615 --> 07:21.089
And the bad news is is whatever ate it...left us that.

07:25.933 --> 07:26.974
I think he likes you.

07:27.104 --> 07:28.375
I don't care. Vanquish it.

07:28.475 --> 07:29.076
Chris!

07:29.176 --> 07:30.377
I mean it. Now.

07:30.477 --> 07:33.149
No! We are not vanquishing a baby. What's wrong with you?

07:33.249 --> 07:35.852
I'm just concerned that this could be the future evil
that gets to Wyatt.

07:35.952 --> 07:36.923
Don't be ridiculous.

07:37.023 --> 07:40.826
What? I'm being ridiculous? There's a demon in the playpen.

07:43.969 --> 07:44.940
I'll get it.

07:45.770 --> 07:48.312
Hey, if it's Jason, tell him I'm in the shower.

07:49.213 --> 07:51.145
Are you avoiding him?

07:51.545 --> 07:58.091
Uh...kind of. I, um...sort of told him that I loved him last night.

07:58.391 --> 08:00.333
Oh. And this is bad?

08:00.504 --> 08:08.811
No. Except I said,"I love you, too," as if he said,
"I love you" first, which he didn't.

08:09.482 --> 08:13.695
So, wait...you told him that he loves you before
he told you that he loves you?

08:14.726 --> 08:15.577
Yeah, that's not good.

08:15.827 --> 08:19.440
Yeah. I'll be lucky if he doesn't move to Hong Kong permanently now.

08:19.871 --> 08:22.173
I really thought I had my empath power under control.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.974
Forget that. What are you gonna do?

08:24.074 --> 08:25.215
What am I supposed to do?

08:25.315 --> 08:27.988
I mean, you tell a guy that you love them, and they bolt.

08:28.088 --> 08:29.389
It's just what they do.

08:29.489 --> 08:32.461
About the baby. I meant the baby. We gotta do something.

08:38.996 --> 08:39.977
Fast.

08:41.779 --> 08:44.312
I can't hear you. Darryl. Speak up.

08:45.052 --> 08:47.284
I know I never asked before, but I'm asking now.

08:47.424 --> 08:51.658
I need help on this one. Magical help.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.369
All right. What's going on?

08:53.469 --> 08:55.801
This stupid kid, I- I mean, he's got hostages.

08:55.902 --> 09:00.476
Only I know him - he wouldn't hurt anybody --
but I'm running out of time to talk him down.

09:00.616 --> 09:05.150
S. W. A. T. 's ready to move in. I don't want to lose him, Paige.

09:05.650 --> 09:06.991
All right.

09:07.121 --> 09:11.535
All right! I'm coming. Ok. Hold your horses.

09:16.379 --> 09:17.810
Where's Wyatt?

09:17.911 --> 09:18.711
Where is he?

09:18.811 --> 09:20.253
Look, look, wait. Listen.

09:20.353 --> 09:21.313
Where's Wyatt?

09:21.484 --> 09:23.025
There he is!

09:23.926 --> 09:25.157
Look! Look!

09:26.059 --> 09:28.000
Where's Wyatt? Where's Wyatt?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.471
There he is!

09:30.632 --> 09:31.503
All right.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.505
I don't think distracting him is the answer.

09:33.605 --> 09:37.018
Wyatt, bad demon. Very bad demon.

09:38.820 --> 09:39.890
Hey, was that Jason?

09:39.991 --> 09:42.763
No. That was my raison d'etre.

09:43.263 --> 09:44.224
Pardon?

09:44.324 --> 09:48.298
That was Darryl. I've been wondering why the temp
agency hasn't called, and now I know why.

09:48.398 --> 09:50.409
I needed to be free to help him.

09:50.610 --> 09:52.011
To do what?

09:52.141 --> 09:54.913
Well, to save an innocent. Why else would he have called?

09:55.013 --> 09:58.887
And, more importantly, why else would I
have been the one to answer the phone?

09:59.327 --> 10:01.059
'Cause you were the closest to it?

10:01.189 --> 10:05.032
No. Because it's my reason for being. Call me if you need help.

10:06.403 --> 10:07.935
What? -- You're just gonna let her go?

10:08.035 --> 10:09.746
You're welcome to try and stop her.

10:10.146 --> 10:11.878
You know I should go talk to Jason.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.079
And her, too.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.221
Wait. Stop. Where are you going?

10:15.351 --> 10:17.593
Are you slightly concerned that there's a demon in the house?

10:17.723 --> 10:23.738
Chris, this is a baby, ok? Relax. You call me if you need anything.

10:24.169 --> 10:25.239
Love you, too.

10:25.770 --> 10:26.340
Don't.

10:27.511 --> 10:28.342
Sorry.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.784
And you're okay with this? Them dumping this on your lap?

10:30.884 --> 10:32.286
Well, they don't seem too worried.

10:32.386 --> 10:37.960
Well, they should be. I need to figure out what
kind of creature we're dealing with here.

11:41.176 --> 11:42.147
Hey, is he in?

11:42.277 --> 11:45.149
No. I mean, yes, he is, but he asked not to be disturbed.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.461
Yeah, but that can't possibly mean me.

11:47.591 --> 11:50.093
Actually, it specifically means you, Phoebe. Sorry.

11:50.234 --> 11:51.395
You guys have a fight?

11:51.665 --> 11:53.566
No. But we're about to.

11:56.409 --> 11:59.241
Listen, Jas- oh.

12:02.774 --> 12:04.476
Oh...I'm sorry.

12:04.576 --> 12:06.357
Phoebe, what are you doing?

12:06.458 --> 12:08.099
I didn't know you were in the middle of a meeting.

12:08.199 --> 12:10.671
Yeah. That's why the door was closed.

12:10.771 --> 12:14.875
Really? Because I was told the door was closed specifically for me.

12:16.477 --> 12:19.149
Vogliate scusarmi. Torno subito.

12:20.451 --> 12:21.922
I didn't know you spoke Italian.

12:22.022 --> 12:22.823
Outside.

12:23.864 --> 12:25.365
How come I didn't know you speak Italian?

12:27.467 --> 12:28.768
Is that what you came here to ask?

12:28.898 --> 12:33.982
No. No, of course not. I just wanted to talk about last night.

12:34.383 --> 12:39.157
Ok, fine, but can we do it later? I'm in the middle
of a very important meeting right now.

12:39.257 --> 12:45.232
Of course. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. So how about tonight?

12:45.332 --> 12:52.078
Tonight. Tonight's not good. I'm flying to Rome.

12:56.221 --> 12:57.252
Wait. What?

12:57.593 --> 13:00.365
I was meaning to tell you. It just came up.

13:01.166 --> 13:04.699
Really? When? Right after I told you I loved you?

13:04.799 --> 13:05.339
Aw, come on!

13:05.439 --> 13:09.173
I've heard of guys running when they hear the "L" word,
but running allthe way to Italy?

13:09.273 --> 13:10.544
That's gotta be some kind of new record!

13:10.644 --> 13:12.015
Would you keep your voice down, please?

13:13.837 --> 13:15.788
It's got nothing to do with that, and you know it.

13:15.888 --> 13:19.231
That's a crock. We both know how you really feel about me.

13:19.361 --> 13:22.464
The only difference is I'm the only one who's not afraid of it. Ciao!

13:27.849 --> 13:30.981
Vicious demons with supernatural strength and venomous claws,

13:31.081 --> 13:35.095
manticores communicate with high- pitched cries and tend
to travel in "packs."

13:36.496 --> 13:40.540
Great. I say we get rid of the little brat before the pack
comes looking for him.

13:40.671 --> 13:44.274
Ok. Fine. What do you suggest we do with him, call social services?

13:44.374 --> 13:46.145
No, I suggest you vanquish it.

13:46.486 --> 13:50.319
Chris, I'm a mother. I can't go around vanquishing babies,
no matter how evil they are.

13:50.619 --> 13:53.131
It's not how evil he is. It's how evil he's gonna be.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.263
You gotta stop looking at him like he's a little baby

13:55.363 --> 13:58.806
and start looking at him like he's an unstoppable
killing machine, because that's what he is.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.308
I realize that, but still --

14:00.408 --> 14:03.550
-- But still nothing. You're supposed to protect
the innocents, right?

14:03.680 --> 14:07.754
Think of all the future innocents you can save by
vanquishing him right now.

14:07.854 --> 14:09.055
Don't you think I know that?

14:09.155 --> 14:13.169
I'm scared to death of what he could possibly to do Wyatt,
but I can't even separate them.

14:13.299 --> 14:15.501
Piper, there's one thing you can do, and you know it.

14:15.631 --> 14:18.243
And you'd better do it fast before any other manticores show up.

14:18.473 --> 14:20.375
There's no known vanquishing potion.

14:23.848 --> 14:26.160
I just...can't do it.

14:27.521 --> 14:31.695
Ok. Well, if you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to Leo.

15:27.554 --> 15:29.705
We're in position, Lieutenant. We've got a clean shot.

15:32.918 --> 15:35.320
Darryl! Darryl! Over here!

15:35.420 --> 15:36.962
Stand by. It's ok. Let her through.

15:40.465 --> 15:41.726
What took you so long?

15:41.826 --> 15:44.999
I would have orbed here, but that could have been
more magic than you had in mind.

15:45.369 --> 15:46.940
I'm not sure what you could have done anyway.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.043
He's not letting any of the hostages go, and S. W. A. T. 'S
ready to move in.

15:50.313 --> 15:52.955
Forget that. I'm not giving up. This is my raison d'etre.

15:53.716 --> 15:54.557
Excuse me?

15:54.917 --> 15:59.061
Listen, I came to help. That's exactly what I'm gonna do,
so what do you need?

16:00.002 --> 16:04.075
I don't know. If I could just talk to the kid...
without getting shot.

16:06.107 --> 16:07.978
I think I have the perfect spell for this.

16:08.249 --> 16:11.181
Whoa, whoa. Spell? What spell?

16:11.551 --> 16:13.123
Just go with me, ok?

16:13.393 --> 16:15.355
Blessed with powers from my destiny,

16:15.455 --> 16:17.597
I bless this hero with invincibility.

16:21.900 --> 16:22.971
How do you feel?

16:23.171 --> 16:25.614
It feels...it feels good.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.286
All right. Go get him, tough guy.

16:40.718 --> 16:42.319
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

16:46.523 --> 16:50.426
Hey, turn around! Get outta here! I swear to god, man,
I'll shoot!

16:50.556 --> 16:52.658
I'll shoot you, man! I swear to god I'll do it!

16:53.198 --> 16:55.430
Put your gun down, son. I just wanna talk.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.733
That's ok. Hold your fire.

17:12.295 --> 17:13.506
I'm goin' in.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.598
Leo, I have been looking everywhere for you.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.171
What are you doing up here?

17:31.731 --> 17:32.942
Communing with the others.

17:35.845 --> 17:36.846
Can anyone see us?

17:36.946 --> 17:40.719
Not me...but you look like a lunatic standing up here
talking to yourself.

17:42.571 --> 17:43.622
What do you want?

17:43.722 --> 17:45.123
It's about Piper.

17:45.223 --> 17:46.164
Is she all right?

17:46.364 --> 17:49.807
Yes, she's fine. Don't worry. It's Wyatt I'm worried about.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.008
Why, what happened?

17:51.108 --> 17:55.041
Nothing yet. Just out of curiosity, on vanquishing demon babies?

17:56.314 --> 17:57.054
Why?

17:57.214 --> 17:59.987
No reason. There's just one playing with Wyatt in his
playpen as we speak.

18:02.829 --> 18:05.602
Ok, listen to me. You will not orb down to your little friend.

18:05.862 --> 18:08.504
Do you understand me? No orbing.

18:14.920 --> 18:15.820
I give up.

18:20.494 --> 18:24.968
Whoo! I have had it with men. They are incorrigible.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.210
Well, let me tell you, little boys are not much better.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.613
I could understand running if he didn't love me back, you know?

18:30.743 --> 18:32.785
Fight or flight. It's the nature of the beast.

18:32.885 --> 18:33.856
Speaking of that --

18:33.956 --> 18:36.488
But he does love me. I know. I felt it, you know?

18:36.588 --> 18:38.930
So what's the big deal? Why is he running?

18:39.060 --> 18:40.602
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

18:40.702 --> 18:43.534
you probably won't be alive much longer to worry about it.

18:43.674 --> 18:46.377
Thank you, yes. That makes me feel so much better.

18:46.477 --> 18:48.348
I'm just saying, if this doesn't work,

18:48.448 --> 18:51.951
we may not be able to vanquish the manticores when
they come to pick up their little one.

18:52.222 --> 18:53.423
Oh, you figured out what they are?

18:53.523 --> 18:55.795
Yeah. And it's not good, believe me.

18:55.925 --> 18:57.626
So maybe Chris was right.

18:57.766 --> 19:01.239
Yeah, I know, but......I can't.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.642
Piper, you said it yourself. He was born evil.

19:03.742 --> 19:09.186
I know. And I still believe that. I do. But something just
doesn't add up about him.

19:09.286 --> 19:11.358
Why isn't Wyatt using his protective shield?

19:11.458 --> 19:13.230
Why doesn't Wyatt think he's evil?

19:13.990 --> 19:16.062
Well, we gotta keep Wyatt away from him.

19:16.654 --> 19:17.564
Phoebe, wait -

19:17.665 --> 19:20.177
You stay away from my nephew, ok?

19:20.277 --> 19:22.539
And don't shimmer after him either, or I'll bind your powers.

19:24.450 --> 19:25.752
Phoebe, hurry! Put him back down.

19:25.882 --> 19:28.254
What? Ok...

19:29.084 --> 19:29.955
Why?

19:31.096 --> 19:32.698
That's why.

19:40.945 --> 19:45.388
Hey! You get away from my kid!

20:09.729 --> 20:12.472
I feel really bad that I wasn't there to help you earlier.

20:12.572 --> 20:14.874
Oh, I don't think you could've helped even if you were there.

20:14.974 --> 20:18.917
Thanks. That thing was just as powerful as the manticore.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.679
Are you sure it wasn't a manticore?

20:20.779 --> 20:24.652
Yeah, I'm positive. It was more, I don't know, like,
beast- like.

20:25.193 --> 20:26.764
What do you think it wanted with the baby?

20:26.864 --> 20:31.268
I don't know, but I think it's really weird that is showed up
right after the baby started crying.

20:31.368 --> 20:32.869
You know, as if it could hear him.

20:33.110 --> 20:35.812
Maybe we can get the baby to cry again and lure
The Beast here,

20:35.912 --> 20:37.683
and torture him into coughing up Piper.

20:37.784 --> 20:39.485
It's a great idea, but we don't have a potion yet.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.588
I can't find Piper anywhere.

20:43.690 --> 20:46.502
Ok, let me get started on the potion.

20:46.632 --> 20:50.806
The good news is if he wanted to kill Piper by now,
he probably would have.

20:51.006 --> 20:55.320
And undoubtedly he's holding her hostage somewhere,
probably magically cloaked.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.894
And I think he's gonna use her as leverage to get that baby,
just you watch.

20:59.994 --> 21:03.066
Since when did you become an expert on hostage situations?

21:03.467 --> 21:04.427
About an hour ago.

21:08.271 --> 21:11.714
Shh, shh. Keep it down. Don't wake the baby. Trust me.

21:11.914 --> 21:12.915
Where's Piper?

21:13.045 --> 21:14.346
That's a really good question.

21:14.486 --> 21:15.417
Wait, she's missing?

21:15.517 --> 21:16.488
Did the manticores take her?

21:16.588 --> 21:18.419
No, some other creature that wanted the baby.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
Damn it, you should have listened to me.

21:19.661 --> 21:21.062
You should have vanquished him when you had the chance.

21:21.162 --> 21:24.305
Well, it's good that we didn't because we're gonna need
the baby to get Piper back.

21:24.565 --> 21:26.076
You guys, shh. Keep your voices down.

21:26.276 --> 21:28.909
I am not convinced that that baby is inherently evil,

21:29.049 --> 21:31.511
which means he's probably not even responsible for any of this.

21:31.611 --> 21:33.082
Oh, come on! Will you please talk to her?

21:33.883 --> 21:39.327
Not everyone is born morally neutral, especially not demons.
They're predisposed to evil.

21:39.468 --> 21:42.400
Predisposed, yeah, but it doesn't mean they can't be
raised to overcome it.

21:42.500 --> 21:46.344
You can't predict whether a kid is gonna be good or
evil based on his genetics.

21:46.444 --> 21:48.816
Paige, we're not talking about kids. We're talking about demons.

21:48.946 --> 21:53.920
No, we are talking about a demon kid who so far has played
nothing but nice with Wyatt.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.632
Ok, you guys, this is all irrelevant.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.764
We need the baby to find Piper, so let's just focus on that,
shall we?

21:59.335 --> 22:02.708
She's right. Although I think I should take Wyatt just to
be on the safe side.

22:03.138 --> 22:04.439
What if the other baby wakes up?

22:04.579 --> 22:06.381
They won't be able to follow me where I'm going.

22:09.424 --> 22:13.798
It's gonna scream bloody murder and call half the
manticores in the city to come save it.

22:13.898 --> 22:15.029
Maybe The Beast, too.

22:15.129 --> 22:19.273
We have to be prepared. Ok. Go, just quietly.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.048
Let's get started on that potion.

22:48.258 --> 22:50.400
Hello? Who's there?

22:51.461 --> 22:52.672
I want the child.

22:53.672 --> 22:54.573
Who are you?

22:54.703 --> 22:55.844
I want the child!

22:56.075 --> 22:58.276
Yeah. I heard you the first time.

23:02.350 --> 23:06.764
Look, if you're trying to scare me, it's not gonna work'cause
I've seen worse. Really.

23:07.164 --> 23:13.009
I doubt it. I don't want to hurt you,
but I will if you don't do as I ask.

23:13.309 --> 23:17.843
Who are you kidding? You need me, otherwise I'd be dead already.

23:18.214 --> 23:20.055
Don't mock me!

23:20.285 --> 23:23.288
Ok, easy, easy. Sorry.

23:25.900 --> 23:31.435
You're not a manticore, are you? So why do you want the kid anyway?

23:32.547 --> 23:33.848
That's not your concern.

23:33.948 --> 23:38.692
Well, it is if you want my help. I'm not just gonna serve
him up to you as a snack.

23:38.852 --> 23:44.467
That's not why I want him. How'd you get him away from
his mother anyway?

23:45.068 --> 23:46.469
We vanquished her.

23:49.441 --> 23:51.343
You have no idea what you've done.

23:51.513 --> 23:55.357
We got a baby away from a demon, and I'm not gonna give
him up to another one.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.758
Then you'll die!

23:56.888 --> 23:58.259
The hell I will.

24:16.695 --> 24:17.856
Any sign of the lieutenant?

24:18.056 --> 24:18.727
Negative.

24:18.897 --> 24:22.400
All right, we'll give him 5 more minutes to talk him out,
then we'll--

24:23.671 --> 24:25.242
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

24:28.845 --> 24:31.518
Don't' shoot! They're hostages!

24:49.243 --> 24:53.346
No sweat! I got it! This lieutenant's on the job, kicking butt,
taking names,

24:53.447 --> 24:56.250
yeah, that's right! That's me! I got it! No sweat!

24:56.350 --> 24:58.452
Yeah, gimme 5. Gimme 5. Gimme some skin.

24:58.852 --> 25:00.353
How you doin'? You lookin' good, Tim.

25:05.007 --> 25:06.058
How'd you do it, man?

25:06.158 --> 25:08.260
How did those bullets bounce right off of your chest like that?

25:08.360 --> 25:09.962
'Cause I'm a bad- ass, that's why, punk.

25:11.963 --> 25:13.465
What the hell was that?

25:14.135 --> 25:14.836
Shut up.

25:20.911 --> 25:22.583
What the hell are you, man?

25:55.281 --> 25:58.854
Last chance. Help me get the child or die.

26:00.815 --> 26:02.787
What are you doing with this?

26:07.011 --> 26:09.403
What is the matter with you? Do you have a death wish?

26:11.535 --> 26:15.108
I've come too far. I've gone through too much to lose him now.

26:15.448 --> 26:17.150
Don't make me kill you!

26:18.120 --> 26:19.952
Why don't you just do it? What are you waiting for?

26:21.694 --> 26:22.795
Get it over with!

26:25.598 --> 26:29.171
I can do worse than kill you. I can keep you here.

26:29.711 --> 26:34.115
You'll never see your child again. Think about it.

26:42.232 --> 26:44.134
Well, can't think of anything else to add.

26:44.264 --> 26:46.306
It's the most powerful potion we've ever made.

26:46.436 --> 26:49.308
I agree. I guess it's time to wake up the baby?

26:55.353 --> 26:55.894
Hello?

26:55.994 --> 26:56.855
Hey, it's me.

26:56.955 --> 26:58.426
Oh, hey, Jason.

26:59.627 --> 27:03.240
I, uh...I didn't want to leave like this.

27:03.340 --> 27:06.173
Uh, I can't really talk right now. I'm kind of busy.

27:06.313 --> 27:08.445
Oh, really? Come on, Phoebe.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.987
Why do you always have to make things so difficult?

27:11.147 --> 27:13.089
Oh, I make things so difficult?

27:13.259 --> 27:14.990
And how exactly do I do that?

27:15.090 --> 27:19.534
By being honest with my feelings and by making you be honest
with yours?

27:19.664 --> 27:20.935
You know it's not that simple.

27:24.038 --> 27:25.509
Ok, I really have to go now.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.111
- Phoebe, wait.
- Have a good flight.

27:28.712 --> 27:29.553
Toss me a vial.

27:38.701 --> 27:39.601
Paige, you ok?

28:16.174 --> 28:17.245
Phoebe, get the vial!

28:28.795 --> 28:30.196
So much for our leverage.

29:12.373 --> 29:16.487
Shh. You're ok. It's all right. You're home now.

29:32.210 --> 29:34.052
This had better work.

29:34.382 --> 29:35.323
Oh, it will.

29:38.956 --> 29:41.128
We just got back from talking to The Elders,
and they're in agreement.

29:41.228 --> 29:43.100
If we can't return the baby safely to the manticores...

29:43.200 --> 29:44.271
...we'll vanquish him.

29:45.202 --> 29:47.043
Talk about your moot points, people.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.574
What's that supposed to mean?

29:48.745 --> 29:50.276
Well, do you notice anything missing?

29:53.519 --> 29:54.289
The baby?

29:54.760 --> 29:55.590
What happened?

29:55.921 --> 29:58.763
The Beast took him...right after the manticores kicked our asses.

29:59.194 --> 30:00.465
This is all Jason's fault.

30:01.165 --> 30:01.936
How's that?

30:02.136 --> 30:03.637
Oh, you're a guy. You wouldn't get it.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.440
Wait. How are we supposed to get back Piper if we don't have a baby?

30:06.580 --> 30:09.312
Well, we're gonna try to have another little get-
together with the manticores.

30:09.452 --> 30:11.124
See if we can't strike some sort of deal.

30:11.254 --> 30:13.326
If we can join forces with them to kill the beast,

30:13.426 --> 30:14.627
then they can get their baby back.

30:14.757 --> 30:16.128
And we get our sister back.

30:16.358 --> 30:18.400
And what if they don't want to join forces?

30:18.530 --> 30:22.003
Well, then we hope we have enough of these fancy
little things to go around.

30:22.344 --> 30:23.845
No. No way. It's too risky.

30:24.105 --> 30:27.078
Well, blood is thicker than water.

30:34.735 --> 30:36.166
Well, quit moving around so much.

30:36.297 --> 30:37.668
You're just making this more difficult.

30:38.669 --> 30:39.770
Just leave me alone.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.843
Why? So you can die? Hey, it's your choice.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.015
I'm just saying if we can't stop this bleeding--

30:46.155 --> 30:47.756
Fine. Whatever. Just hurry up.

30:48.487 --> 30:52.631
You're welcome. Who did this to you?

30:53.461 --> 30:54.572
Your sisters.

30:55.033 --> 30:56.734
Oh. Sorry.

30:57.475 --> 31:00.948
Actually, if they used the potion I think they did,
you're lucky to be alive.

31:01.048 --> 31:02.419
You should have been blown to pieces.

31:02.549 --> 31:03.450
How do you know?

31:03.550 --> 31:05.622
Well, 'cause I made it.

31:07.553 --> 31:10.096
Oh, come on. Show a little spine. What kind of demon are you?

31:10.226 --> 31:11.337
I'm not a demon.

31:12.738 --> 31:17.782
Then what are you? I saw a picture of a man in the bedroom.

31:19.113 --> 31:21.716
Oh, come on. I've been around a lot of demons,

31:21.886 --> 31:25.459
and they don't usually live in neighborhoods right out
of Home & Garden.

31:25.629 --> 31:27.060
Is that why you're helping me?

31:27.661 --> 31:30.363
You think this is some sort of hideous curse or something?

31:30.934 --> 31:32.375
Yeah, basically.

31:34.507 --> 31:37.049
Well, then go. I don't need your pity.

31:37.209 --> 31:39.521
That's no what happened, and that's not who I am.

31:40.382 --> 31:44.926
Not anymore, anyway. Just leave us. Go.

31:45.326 --> 31:51.611
Us? You mean you and your...son? What happened?

31:55.645 --> 32:00.089
Manticores mate with humans to create hybrids so they can blend in.

32:00.220 --> 32:04.834
Hide in plain sight. They kill their mates after conception,
but I got away.

32:06.205 --> 32:09.007
Ever since, all I could think about was saving my son.

32:09.508 --> 32:12.080
So he wouldn't have to be raised like one of them.

32:12.881 --> 32:17.995
The only chance I had to do that was...to turn myself into this,
to become powerful.

32:18.425 --> 32:20.557
But, um, how?

32:20.797 --> 32:25.341
I just started mixing potions...using whatever
I could steal from them.

32:25.802 --> 32:28.544
I didn't know what I was doing, but I didn't care.

32:28.644 --> 32:31.917
All I cared about was finding a way to fight them...
to find him.

32:34.349 --> 32:38.833
I didn't care what would happen to me.
I just wanted my son.

32:44.037 --> 32:45.839
You know they're gonna try and take him back.

32:47.410 --> 32:48.381
I know.

32:49.552 --> 32:52.585
So let's get you fixed up so we can
fight them together.

33:15.695 --> 33:16.796
Sorry to interrupt.

33:18.567 --> 33:20.609
Ah- ah- ah! I wouldn't do that if I were you.

33:24.513 --> 33:26.215
Do you think we have enough potion?

33:27.516 --> 33:29.928
So...who wants to go hunting with us?

33:37.104 --> 33:38.505
This is gonna be a little cold.

33:46.092 --> 33:49.595
The bleeding's not stopping. You should c
ome home with me, and we can do more there.

33:50.666 --> 33:51.637
No, I can't.

33:52.267 --> 33:53.638
If you're worried about my sisters --

33:53.798 --> 33:57.812
It's not your sisters I'm worried about. It's the manticores.

33:57.942 --> 34:01.115
They'll be looking for me there.
They'll be looking for him there.

34:01.215 --> 34:04.588
But you don't understand. We have somebody who can heal
you once we turn you back into--

34:04.688 --> 34:10.463
You can't turn me back. No one can. Not unless I die.

34:12.304 --> 34:14.646
So how were you planning on raising your son?

34:14.777 --> 34:19.150
I wasn't. I figured I'd find someone...after.

34:20.051 --> 34:24.695
All I cared about was saving him. That's exactly what I'm
gonna keep on doing.

34:26.897 --> 34:30.969
You can't run forever, you know. Not for long. Not with that.

34:31.541 --> 34:33.413
And who's gonna save him when you're dead?

34:35.083 --> 34:37.216
You have a way with words, you know that?

34:37.746 --> 34:38.917
I ad- lib a lot.

34:42.931 --> 34:43.891
Piper, duck!

34:46.132 --> 34:47.204
What are you doing?

34:50.467 --> 34:51.619
Let's get her out of here.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.670
No! Wait!

34:59.926 --> 35:01.097
What the hell are you doing?

35:01.197 --> 35:02.098
Saving your life.

35:02.198 --> 35:04.570
No, no, no. You don't understand. We have to go back. Hurry.

35:37.008 --> 35:38.259
Leo, we need you!

35:40.671 --> 35:42.033
Hurry. He's dying.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.144
Who is he?

35:43.304 --> 35:45.245
The Beast. Heal. Heal. Hurry.

35:45.646 --> 35:46.747
Where's the baby?

35:46.847 --> 35:47.778
Manticores have him.

35:47.878 --> 35:49.119
Oh, so the plan worked.

35:49.349 --> 35:50.620
Yeah. A little too well.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.522
And now we just have to get the baby back.

35:52.622 --> 35:53.362
What?

35:55.324 --> 35:57.296
Paige, will you go fill up some potion vials, please?

35:57.466 --> 35:58.036
Yeah.

35:58.136 --> 35:58.937
Lots of'em.

35:59.067 --> 36:00.168
Hold up, are you serious?

36:00.268 --> 36:03.181
You finally get rid of the demon child and now you
want to risk your lives trying to get it back?

36:03.511 --> 36:04.842
He's not a demon child.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.314
That's my son.

36:07.985 --> 36:09.386
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

36:10.027 --> 36:11.558
I can't believe I'm human again.

36:11.789 --> 36:13.331
Aren't you glad you didn't kill me now?

36:13.661 --> 36:15.432
Not funny. I don't think that's funny.

36:15.562 --> 36:16.133
Agreed.

36:16.233 --> 36:18.905
Oh, what? Are you two on, like, the same team now?

36:20.847 --> 36:22.979
We're gonna get your baby back. I promise.

36:23.679 --> 36:24.820
Do we not have a say in this?

36:24.951 --> 36:26.152
No, we don't.

36:26.292 --> 36:30.956
One thing you gotta learn about being their Whitelighter is once
they make up their mind, that's it.

36:31.056 --> 36:33.138
Besides, I'm a father first.

36:34.539 --> 36:38.612
So we're gonna have to separate the baby before we attack.
You know that, right?

36:38.712 --> 36:39.243
Why?

36:39.343 --> 36:41.445
Well, because the potion vanquishes manticores.

36:41.585 --> 36:43.687
And...your son is half manticore.

36:57.609 --> 36:58.309
See him?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.921
Let's just hope he sees you before they see us.

37:01.282 --> 37:02.583
Should I just orb the baby to us?

37:03.053 --> 37:06.666
No. He'll probably just shimmer back, and then we'll be in trouble,
but this is gonna work.

37:07.697 --> 37:08.298
Hurry. Hurry.

37:17.546 --> 37:18.817
You can do it. Come on. Come on.

37:20.819 --> 37:21.689
Peekaboo!

37:29.676 --> 37:31.178
Come on. You can do it.

37:54.419 --> 37:56.360
You're ok. Hi!

37:59.433 --> 38:00.434
Good job!

38:01.965 --> 38:04.637
So much for nature being more important than nurture.

38:43.411 --> 38:44.842
Here are some clothes and a stroller.

38:46.143 --> 38:47.054
Sure you don't mind?

38:47.314 --> 38:49.826
No, not at all. Wyatt has outgrown it all,

38:49.926 --> 38:53.529
and I don't see myself having more kids anytime soon, so enjoy.

38:53.900 --> 38:57.303
Thanks...uh, for everything.

38:57.733 --> 39:00.545
I just -- I wish there was something I could do for you.

39:00.646 --> 39:02.918
Well, you could tell us your name.

39:03.649 --> 39:04.350
Sorry?

39:04.450 --> 39:07.052
I mean, unless you prefer being called "The Beast"?"

39:08.253 --> 39:10.665
Derek. My name's Derek.

39:11.326 --> 39:12.667
It's nice to meet you, Derek.

39:14.168 --> 39:15.469
What's his name?

39:15.669 --> 39:19.883
I-- I never gave him one. Actually, I never -- I never had the chance.

39:20.343 --> 39:21.514
Well, now you do.

39:23.616 --> 39:27.390
Well, I guess I should be going. That is if I
can pry him away from Wyatt.

39:27.830 --> 39:29.061
Yeah. Good luck.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.306
That is cute.

39:36.407 --> 39:37.048
I'll get it.

39:39.380 --> 39:41.622
Uh, you know, if you ever need us to bind his powers...

39:42.022 --> 39:45.125
No. I mean, thanks. That's really sweet, but it's not necessary.

39:45.395 --> 39:49.028
He's a good boy, so...it's just up to me to
make sure he stays that way.

39:49.869 --> 39:51.941
In that case, he's in good hands.

39:55.173 --> 39:55.944
Well, take care.

39:57.616 --> 39:58.446
You, too.

40:08.065 --> 40:09.466
What? What'd you do?

40:10.877 --> 40:14.150
I kinda forgot to reverse the spell I put on Darryl.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.744
What are you doing here? I-- I thought you were on a plane.

41:06.045 --> 41:09.889
I canceled the flight. I mean, it is my plane.

41:11.850 --> 41:12.921
What about the winery?

41:13.522 --> 41:14.663
It'll be there in the morning.

41:16.364 --> 41:20.608
I, uh, just wasn't sure whether you would be.

41:20.968 --> 41:22.339
I didn't want to take the risk.

41:22.670 --> 41:23.210
Really?

41:23.580 --> 41:24.011
Really.

41:25.682 --> 41:30.456
You were right. I was -- I was running, but not
for the reasons that you think.

41:30.556 --> 41:34.500
I am not afraid of how I feel about you.
It doesn't scare me one bit.

41:35.261 --> 41:36.532
Then why?

41:37.172 --> 41:42.377
It's...a little unnerving to have somebody tell you
how you feel all the time...

41:42.947 --> 41:44.318
before you know it yourself.

41:45.219 --> 41:48.252
I know. I'm sorry.

41:48.392 --> 41:51.064
You do that a lot, too. You're very intuitive.

41:51.726 --> 41:56.640
It's, uh, it's pretty amazing, actually. It's a real gift.

41:57.511 --> 42:00.283
Yeah, well, sometimes it can be a curse, too.

42:00.814 --> 42:01.744
Tell me about it.

42:04.947 --> 42:14.435
Look, all I'm saying is that I'd like to be able to express my
if that's all right with you?

42:15.436 --> 42:16.947
It's perfectly ok.

42:17.047 --> 42:17.448
Good.

42:22.122 --> 42:28.167
So...while we're on the subject...how do you feel about me?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.001
I love you, too.
