00:28.890 --> 00:30.200

00:57.990 --> 00:59.020
( <i>honking )</i>

01:03.360 --> 01:04.300
D-ohhh!

01:04.360 --> 01:05.300
Ahhh!

01:19.740 --> 01:21.580
Mmm. "hors do-vers."

01:21.640 --> 01:22.570
Homer!

01:22.650 --> 01:24.250
You promised.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.710
I promised I wouldn't eat?

01:25.780 --> 01:26.950
Never. You lie.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.790
Homer, please.
We've never thrown a party.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.790
Now we're gonna pay back
all the friends

01:30.850 --> 01:32.710
who have invited us
to their homes.

01:32.790 --> 01:34.130
Never thrown a party?

01:34.190 --> 01:36.290
What about that
big bash we had

01:36.360 --> 01:38.860
with all the champagne,
musicians and holy men
and everything?

01:38.930 --> 01:40.770
- That was our wedding.
- Oh.

01:40.830 --> 01:42.600
Children,
it's time for you
to go to bed.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.870
Mom, I want to hear
the witty banter of
sophisticated adults.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.900
Yeah, you can't have
any fun in bed.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.140
( <i>chuckles )</i>

01:48.200 --> 01:51.070
Son, when you're older,
you'll know better.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.740
Mmm.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.750
Oh, baby.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.210
Mmm.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.750
Yeah.

01:57.810 --> 01:58.840
- ( <i>doorbell rings )
- Oh, they're here!</i>

01:58.910 --> 01:59.770
How does
everything look?

01:59.850 --> 02:01.450
How do I look?

02:01.520 --> 02:02.250
- Do we have enough glasses?
- Do we have enough gag ice
cubes?

02:02.320 --> 02:03.520
Homer, put a record on!

02:03.590 --> 02:04.420
What are our friends'
names, again?

02:04.490 --> 02:05.490
Children, go!

02:05.550 --> 02:07.420
( <i>Tom Jones music plays )</i>

02:07.490 --> 02:09.590
Hi, Homer.
Please come in.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.300
You look
lovely tonight.
Aw Marge,
you're looking swell.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.630
And the house--

02:12.700 --> 02:14.070
you've done... whatever.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.000
Hey, anybody mind
if I serve as bartender?

02:16.070 --> 02:18.140
I have a Ph.D. in Mixology.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.140
( <i>disdainfully: )
College boy.</i>

02:20.200 --> 02:21.530
Hey, Homer,
care to try

02:21.600 --> 02:23.460
some of my Flanders
Planter's Punch?

02:23.540 --> 02:25.410
Why not?
I paid for it.

02:28.240 --> 02:32.040
Flanders, Next time why don't
you put a little alcohol in it?

02:32.110 --> 02:33.270
<i>Au contraire, Simpson.</i>

02:33.350 --> 02:36.250
It has three shots of rum,
a jigger of bourbon

02:36.320 --> 02:39.260
and a little dab-a-roo
of Crème de Cassis for flavor.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.260
Really? I do have a
warm sense of well-being

02:42.320 --> 02:45.190
and I seem to be
slurring my speech.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.460
You're right.
Give me another.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.500
Go easy on the alc-e-hol.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.960
Remember last year,
at the Winfield's party

02:50.030 --> 02:52.770
when you threw up
in the laundry hamper?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.110
No.
( <i>groans )</i>

02:59.370 --> 03:02.900
Hey, you're Homer's
sister-in-law, right?

03:02.980 --> 03:04.820
I remember you.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.320
I don't remember you
being so beaut- ( <i>belches )
-iful...</i>

03:08.380 --> 03:10.250
Ow! Hey..!

03:10.320 --> 03:12.220
( <i>belching
and coughing )</i>

03:12.290 --> 03:14.890
Is that a new kind of mace?
Really painful.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.530
Oh, Dr. Hibbert.

03:16.590 --> 03:18.430
Enjoying the party?

03:18.490 --> 03:20.520
Uh, no, not really.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.870
Someone seems to have
slipped one of those
novelty ice cubes

03:22.930 --> 03:24.500
with a fake fly

03:24.570 --> 03:26.300
in my drink.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.940
( <i>laughing )
It was me.</i>

03:28.000 --> 03:29.230
You fell for it.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.770
These novelty ice cubes
are often made

03:31.840 --> 03:33.780
from highly toxic chemicals.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.870
Ironically, a real fly
would have been much more
sanitary.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.680
You should see the
look on your face.
It's priceless.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.050
Hmm.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.590
Bart! Come over here.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.860
What?
You little monkey.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.780
You're a little monkey,
aren't you?

03:49.860 --> 03:50.960
Yes, sir.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.560
Bart, do that thing you do
that's so cute.

03:52.630 --> 03:53.670
What?

03:53.730 --> 03:55.100
That thing you know
how to do.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.060
What?

03:57.730 --> 03:58.760
Go to bed.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.030
Hey, everybody!

04:00.100 --> 04:01.070
Whoa.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.310
Look!

04:02.370 --> 04:04.580
I'm the funniest guy
in the world!

04:04.640 --> 04:05.680
Whoa.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.380
Homer, you're
the king.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.970
Hmm..

04:21.920 --> 04:25.350
( <i>slurring: )
I have been wanting
to tell you off for years</i>

04:25.430 --> 04:27.330
but I never had the nerve.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.730
I don't know you.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.070
My wife and your wife
are friends.

04:30.130 --> 04:31.040
We just met
just three hours ago.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.970
You stink!

04:33.040 --> 04:36.410
You and your whole lousy
operation stinks.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.240
I quit!

04:38.310 --> 04:39.640
Gee, don't quit.

04:39.710 --> 04:40.580
All right then.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.280
Could you...

04:45.350 --> 04:46.720
give me a...

04:46.780 --> 04:48.720
handful of peanuts...

04:48.780 --> 04:49.780
Maude?

04:49.850 --> 04:50.890
Oh, sure.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.180
Not those peanuts.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.850
The ones at the bottom.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.320
Oh, okay.

04:56.390 --> 04:57.700
Ah...

04:59.090 --> 05:00.890
( <i>growling )</i>

05:00.960 --> 05:02.590
Barney:
<i>Hey, thanks for inviting me.</i>

05:02.660 --> 05:04.660
I had a wonderful time.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.760
I must apologize
for my husband.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.010
If you want him to live
through the night

05:09.070 --> 05:10.940
I suggest you roll him
onto his stomach.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.580
Thank you, I will,
Dr. Hibbert.

05:12.640 --> 05:13.980
Thanks for coming.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.840
Remember, I said <i>if.</i>

05:18.010 --> 05:19.440
( <i>snoring )</i>

05:19.510 --> 05:21.480
( <i>straining )</i>

05:21.550 --> 05:23.420
I have never been
so embarrassed

05:23.490 --> 05:24.760
in my life.

05:24.820 --> 05:25.920
Why?

05:25.990 --> 05:27.530
What did you do?

05:31.890 --> 05:34.960
( <i>Marge grunting )</i>

05:35.030 --> 05:37.100
Ooh. Ow.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.300
Ooh.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.000
Marge..! Huh?
( <i>cat shrieks )</i>

05:40.070 --> 05:41.010
Come here.

05:41.070 --> 05:42.340
Where are we going?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.260
Shh!

05:44.570 --> 05:47.140
I want to make sure
the kids don't hear.

05:47.210 --> 05:50.050
When I was young,
I always hated knowing
my parents were fighting.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.050
They're fighting
in the car again.

05:52.110 --> 05:55.010
That music always sends
a chill down my spine.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.450
Homer, do you remember the way
you acted at the party
last night?

05:58.520 --> 05:59.990
The way I acted?

06:00.060 --> 06:03.060
...so I said, "I must get out
of these wet clothes

06:03.130 --> 06:05.060
and into a dry martini."
( <i>group chuckles )</i>

06:05.130 --> 06:06.460
Well-said, indeed.

06:06.530 --> 06:08.030
Good Lord, there's a fly
in my drink.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.700
I put it there.
You did?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.070
I slipped it into
your glass as a gag.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.390
Pure hilarity.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.770
Pure Homer.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.370
I pronounce it to be

06:15.440 --> 06:17.280
the most whimsical
joke of the season.

06:17.340 --> 06:19.610
( <i>laughing and clapping )</i>

06:28.550 --> 06:32.990
( <i>Homer panting )</i>

06:33.060 --> 06:34.290
Homer?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.790
I like to think

06:35.860 --> 06:37.200
I'm a patient, tolerant woman

06:37.260 --> 06:39.500
and that there was no line
you could cross

06:39.560 --> 06:41.870
that could make me
stop loving you.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.440
But last night you didn't
just cross that line

06:44.500 --> 06:46.600
you threw up on it!

06:46.670 --> 06:47.770
I'm sorry, honey.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.480
Can't we just forget it,
and go to church?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.580
I'm going to church
alone today.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.450
You're going
to stay here
and explain to Bart

06:54.510 --> 06:56.050
why you scarred him
for life.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.950
No, I didn't!

06:58.010 --> 07:00.680
I... oh, you mean
inside, don't you?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.020
About last night--

07:02.080 --> 07:05.010
you might have noticed Daddy
acting a little strange,

07:05.090 --> 07:07.330
and you probably
don't understand why.

07:07.390 --> 07:08.530
I understand why.
You were wasted.

07:08.590 --> 07:11.260
I admit it. I didn't know
when to say when.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.800
I'm sorry it happened.

07:12.860 --> 07:15.700
I just hope you didn't
lose a lot of respect for me.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.260
Dad, I respect you
as much as I ever did
or ever will.
Aw..

07:19.330 --> 07:22.660
Now, before I give you all
a sneak preview of next week's
sermon,

07:22.740 --> 07:24.580
I have some announcements
to make.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.880
We have some new pamphlets
available in our
church news rack

07:27.940 --> 07:30.470
including <i>Bible Bafflers,
Satan's Boners</i>

07:30.550 --> 07:32.750
<i>Good Grief, More Satan's Boners</i>

07:32.810 --> 07:36.040
and for the teens,
<i>It's Not Cool to Fry in Hell.</i>

07:36.120 --> 07:39.020
Marge? Marge?

07:39.090 --> 07:40.790
( <i>people whispering )</i>

07:40.860 --> 07:43.160
I'm sorry, the Lord and I
can't compete

07:43.230 --> 07:46.030
with the squeaking
of Homer Simpson's shoes.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.790
Why don't we just
put everything on hold
until he takes a seat.

07:48.860 --> 07:49.790
Sorry, Reverend.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.200
Sit down, Homer.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.740
<i>Mrs. Lovejoy and myself
will be holding</i>

07:53.800 --> 07:57.110
<i>our third annual marriage
retreat next weekend
at Catfish Lake.</i>

07:57.170 --> 07:59.180
It's psychological counseling

07:59.240 --> 08:01.550
for couples whose marriages
are hanging by a thread

08:01.610 --> 08:02.810
( <i>groans )</i>

08:02.880 --> 08:05.250
or those just in need
of a tune-up.
Hmm?

08:05.310 --> 08:08.140
Now, if you wish to participate,
please sign up in the lobby

08:08.220 --> 08:10.090
after the service is over.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.690
Will the Simpsons be attending
our little retreat?

08:12.750 --> 08:14.750
Oh, well, it's very tempting.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.380
Really a wonderful idea.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.600
Marge!

08:17.660 --> 08:19.060
What are you doing?

08:19.130 --> 08:20.730
Are you insane?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.830
No! Give it to..!

08:22.900 --> 08:24.240
We'll be there.
D-oh!

08:26.740 --> 08:28.610
Marriage encounter weekend,
here I come.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.310
Now you want to go?1

08:30.370 --> 08:32.610
They're holding it
at Catfish Lake.

08:32.669 --> 08:34.940
They couldn't
call it Catfish Lake

08:35.010 --> 08:37.350
if it didn't have
a catfish in it.

08:37.409 --> 08:40.880
We're going to this retreat
to give our marriage a tune-up
and that's all.

08:40.950 --> 08:41.890
No fishing.
Oh!

08:41.950 --> 08:42.950
( <i>doorbell rings )</i>

08:43.020 --> 08:43.890
That must be
the baby-sitter.

08:43.950 --> 08:45.480
Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.

08:45.550 --> 08:46.810
Simpson...

08:46.890 --> 08:48.260
Simpson...

08:48.320 --> 08:50.690
Come back for more, eh?

08:50.760 --> 08:51.660
( <i>gasps )</i>

08:51.730 --> 08:53.400
( <i>screaming )</i>

09:00.870 --> 09:02.570
( <i>screaming )</i>

09:02.640 --> 09:04.280
Hey! What?!

09:04.340 --> 09:07.710
Oh my! Where are we supposed
to get a sitter on such
short notice?

09:07.780 --> 09:12.180
Oh dear, if we can't find a
baby-sitter, we can't go.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.920
What a kick in the teeth.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.680
What do you need
a baby-sitter for?

09:15.750 --> 09:17.190
I'm almost 10 and a half.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.420
Mom, you wouldn't dare.

09:18.490 --> 09:20.020
Don't take that tone
with me young lady,

09:20.090 --> 09:21.030
or I'll give you a taste
of the back of me hand.

09:21.090 --> 09:22.060
No you don't!

09:22.120 --> 09:23.650
<i>Grandpa?</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:25.330
Hey! Yow! What?

09:25.390 --> 09:26.350
Grandpa,
could you do something?

09:26.430 --> 09:27.570
I can dress myself.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.100
Oh. Well I was wondering

09:29.160 --> 09:32.860
Do you think you could
baby-sit the kids this weekend?

09:32.930 --> 09:34.400
I wouldn't ask,
except I'm desperate.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.210
Oh, sure.

09:36.270 --> 09:39.040
Last resort--
old Grampa, the feeb--

09:39.110 --> 09:43.650
the guy who can't be counted on
for nothing, nohow, dag-nab it.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.320
Everyone's against me.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.720
I'll do it.

09:47.780 --> 09:50.810
Marge, just putting
a few last things in the trunk.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.160
( <i>chuckles )</i>

09:52.220 --> 09:54.830
Now, if Maggie runs a fever,
call this number.

09:54.890 --> 09:56.760
If she sticks her finger
in an electrical socket

09:56.830 --> 09:57.960
call <i>this number.</i>

09:58.030 --> 09:59.860
And if she drinks
pine cleanser, call this.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.770
Just give the list!
I can read.

10:01.830 --> 10:02.970
Alright, alright.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.200
Good-bye, children,
and behave yourselves.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.640
Mwah

10:07.700 --> 10:10.970
Call this number if Grampa
falls in the bathtub.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.040
I heard that.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.010
All:
Bye.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.440
Grandpa

10:14.510 --> 10:17.850
Mom was in such a hurry,
she forget to give you this.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.170
It's a list of things
Lisa and I can and can't do.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.590
Uh-huh... uh-huh...

10:22.650 --> 10:24.590
You're allowed to smoke cigars?

10:27.820 --> 10:29.980
Homer:
Hmm... bait.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.330
Uh-oh.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.700
Better get some gas.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.660
Fill 'er up.

10:36.730 --> 10:39.600
I guess I'll go
and stretch my legs.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.000
Where are you headed?

10:44.070 --> 10:45.330
Catfish Lake.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.580
Oh, after General Sherman,
are you?

10:47.640 --> 10:49.270
Wait a minute.
Who's General Sherman?

10:49.340 --> 10:51.540
He's only the biggest catfish
in these parts.
Oh yeah?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.740
They say he weighs
upwards of 500 pounds.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.790
Who says that?

10:54.850 --> 10:56.420
They do.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.880
Homer:
Oh.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.950
That's the only known
picture of the general.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.230
Can't see what he is, exactly.

11:01.290 --> 11:02.960
He's freakishly big, though.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.090
Hmm...

11:04.160 --> 11:05.930
Gentlemen, I am going

11:05.990 --> 11:08.120
to catch General Sherman.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.570
Ooh...

11:09.630 --> 11:10.770
Oh, my.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.160
After the supermarket

11:12.230 --> 11:15.130
we'll go to the video store,
grab a Krusty Burger

11:15.200 --> 11:16.830
and head for the arcade.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.540
Grandpa's a kindly
old man who trusts us.

11:19.610 --> 11:22.880
Are you sure it's right
to take advantage of him?

11:22.940 --> 11:24.870
Lise, in these crazy,
topsy-turvy times

11:24.950 --> 11:27.320
who's to say
what's right or wrong?

11:27.380 --> 11:29.920
But right now,
my gut's telling me
"bleed Gramps dry."

11:29.990 --> 11:31.590
Reverend:
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson

11:31.650 --> 11:32.910
Welcome.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.090
Reverend, we're glad
we could come.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.160
Hello, Helen.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.150
Hello, Marge.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.530
Why, Homer Simpson.

11:38.590 --> 11:41.120
Here to give your marriage
a little spit shine?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.100
None of your business,
Flanders.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.460
Say, Reverend, are we gonna get
a chance to do any fishing?

11:46.530 --> 11:47.860
Oh, I'm afraid not.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.510
A marriage can't be reconciled
in a few hours, Homer.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.840
It takes a whole weekend
to do that.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.180
We must bait our hooks
with honesty

11:55.240 --> 11:58.470
that way, a happy marriage
won't be the one that got away.

11:58.550 --> 11:59.880
I see.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.620
I also understand
bowling expressions.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.780
Three couples--
our best turnout yet.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.580
Why don't we go around the room

12:06.660 --> 12:08.990
and everyone
can introduce themselves

12:09.060 --> 12:10.930
and tell us a little bit
about why they're here.

12:10.990 --> 12:11.920
John, Gloria?

12:11.990 --> 12:13.420
My name's Gloria.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.530
I'm here because Johnny-boy

12:15.600 --> 12:19.200
hasn't been able to cut it
man-wise for some time.

12:19.270 --> 12:22.470
Not that I'd want his odor
of gin and sour defeat

12:22.540 --> 12:23.810
pressed against me.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.210
That's enough, Gloria!

12:25.270 --> 12:26.700
Thank you, Gloria.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.580
John, why don't you tell us
a little about why you're here.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.540
She never cooks,
she keeps a filthy house

12:31.610 --> 12:33.270
and she talks profanely.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.250
She's the queen
of the harpies.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.320
No, I'm not.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.450
Here's your crown,
your majesty!

12:38.520 --> 12:40.360
- Queen of the harpies!
- Get away from me,
you swine!

12:40.420 --> 12:42.660
You've come
to the right place.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.120
First, I want you to look
into each other's eyes.

12:47.560 --> 12:52.330
Your eyes-- I've forgotten
how beautiful they are.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.600
Let's never
fight again.

12:53.670 --> 12:55.270
We were fools to argue.

12:55.340 --> 12:56.310
Let's not talk about that.

12:56.370 --> 12:57.710
Let's not talk at all!

12:57.770 --> 12:59.970
Remember my saving your lives
and bringing you happiness

13:00.040 --> 13:02.750
when we pass
the collection plate
next week.

13:02.810 --> 13:06.050
All right, Ned, Maude,
what brings you here?

13:06.110 --> 13:07.040
Well...

13:07.120 --> 13:08.520
Go on, Neddy.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.380
Sometimes Maude--
God bless her--

13:10.450 --> 13:12.190
she underlines passages
in <i>my Bible</i>

13:12.250 --> 13:13.810
because she can't find hers.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.860
Oh, lucky you don't keep guns
in the house.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.420
Homer, why are you here?

13:17.490 --> 13:19.200
Because I got drunk
and looked down her dress.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.790
No, no, Homer. Marge is going
to tell us all <i>your faults.</i>

13:23.870 --> 13:26.070
Why don't you
tell us about hers.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.830
Oh, she's perfect.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.230
Come on, Homer.
What are her faults?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.900
Sometimes
it can be annoying.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.070
Oh, Homer...

13:32.140 --> 13:32.940
Marge?
Don't interrupt.

13:33.010 --> 13:33.940
You'll get your turn.

13:34.010 --> 13:34.980
I'm done.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.370
Okay. Marge?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.270
Well, it's not that I
don't love the guy.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.650
I'm always sticking up for him.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.290
It's just that he's
so self-centered.

13:44.350 --> 13:45.480
Wait! Oh!

13:45.550 --> 13:46.850
Now, Homer.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.130
He forgets birthdays,
anniversaries, holidays--

13:50.190 --> 13:52.130
both religious and secular.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.260
He chews with his mouth open.
He gambles.

13:54.330 --> 13:57.470
He hangs out at a seedy bar
with bums and lowlifes.

13:57.530 --> 13:58.470
It's true.

13:58.530 --> 13:59.530
It's all true.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.710
- Homer, don't interrupt.
- Sorry.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.370
He blows his nose
on the towels

14:03.440 --> 14:04.640
and puts them back
in the middle.

14:04.710 --> 14:05.910
I only did that
a couple of times.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.680
Lisa:
Half a gallon
of chocolate.

14:08.740 --> 14:09.940
Check.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.620
Half a gallon
of chocolate
brownie fudge.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.280
Half a gallon
of chocolate
chocolate chip.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.820
Did your mom really write
that shopping list?

14:15.880 --> 14:16.940
Grampa, what a question.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.020
What's next, Lise?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.260
Sprinkles
and syrups.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.030
Hey Grampa,
aisle six,
and step on it.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.990
All right,
but put out the cigar.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.860
Marge:
<i>He drinks out of the carton.</i>

14:24.930 --> 14:27.160
<i>He never changes the baby.</i>

14:27.230 --> 14:30.500
<i>When he goes to sleep,
he makes chewing noises</i>

14:30.570 --> 14:33.670
<i>and when he wakes up,
he makes honking noises.</i>

14:33.740 --> 14:36.940
Oh, oh, and he scratches himself
with his keys.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.680
I guess that's it.

14:38.740 --> 14:41.450
Oh, no, wait.
He kicks me in his sleep

14:41.510 --> 14:44.350
and his toenails
are too long and yellow.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.510
That's all I can think of
right now.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.050
I guess you're all tired.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.750
I want to thank you for letting
me get some things off my chest.

14:50.820 --> 14:51.690
( <i>groans )</i>

14:51.750 --> 14:53.080
Well, we've missed the luau.

14:53.150 --> 14:54.980
What's say we call it a night.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.260
McBain ( on TV ):
<i>But, Captain</i>

14:56.320 --> 14:58.120
I can't avenge
my partner's death

14:58.190 --> 14:59.690
with this peashooter.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.900
I don't want
to hear it, McBain.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.290
That cannon of yours
is against regulations.

15:03.360 --> 15:07.660
In this department,
we go by the book.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.870
Bye, book.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.210
All right,
McBain!

15:10.270 --> 15:12.480
You know kids,
it's getting pretty late.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.740
Yeah, you should go
to bed, Grampa.

15:13.810 --> 15:15.010
We've had a big day.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.980
You wise guy,
little smart aleck...

15:18.050 --> 15:19.850
It's no use kidding myself.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.740
I'm having
an ethical crisis.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.190
Out at 5:00.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.860
Catch General Sherman at 5:30.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.260
Clean him at 6:00.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.990
Eat him at 6:30.

15:29.060 --> 15:32.430
Back in bed by 7:00
with no incriminating evidence.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.390
Heh-heh-heh,
The perfect crime.

15:34.460 --> 15:35.560
Homer...

15:35.630 --> 15:36.900
( <i>gasps )</i>

15:36.970 --> 15:39.040
You're sneaking out
to go fishing.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.140
I can't believe
your selfishness.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.230
You can go fishing anytime

15:43.300 --> 15:46.130
but we're here trying
to save our marriage.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.080
You're thinking
about fishing

15:48.140 --> 15:49.940
even when I'm talking
right now, right?

15:50.010 --> 15:51.420
Would this be a
good time to be honest?

15:51.480 --> 15:52.450
Yes.

15:52.510 --> 15:53.840
You're right, I am.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.250
Help me, Marge.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.890
What do I do
to be a good guy?!

15:57.950 --> 15:59.180
Get back in bed.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.750
Oh, all right.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.990
But I can't sleep.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.200
Can I take a walk?

16:07.260 --> 16:08.630
Sure.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.070
Got to be a good husband.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.160
Got to be a good husband.

16:13.230 --> 16:15.300
I got to be a good husband.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.270
Hey, kid,
you forgot your...

16:17.340 --> 16:18.510
( <i>screams )</i>

16:19.570 --> 16:21.940
( <i>screaming )</i>

16:24.180 --> 16:26.680
Go ahead, General Sherman,
foist your strength

16:26.750 --> 16:29.320
you big, ugly catfish.

16:29.380 --> 16:32.750
I got a skillet and
a stick of butter
with your name on it.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.960
Homer?

16:35.020 --> 16:37.020
( <i>Homer yelling )</i>

16:37.090 --> 16:38.660
Hmm?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.270
Sugar?

16:41.330 --> 16:42.330
Yes, ten please.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.830
Hey Grampa,
top me off.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.840
Are you sure your Ma
lets you kids drink coffee?

16:45.900 --> 16:47.500
For the last time, yes!

16:47.570 --> 16:49.070
Come on, give up.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.770
Huh?

16:50.840 --> 16:52.310
D-ohhh!

16:52.370 --> 16:54.600
Hey Milhouse.
Big blowout at <i>casa de Simpson.</i>

16:54.680 --> 16:56.650
The only adult is frail and old.

16:56.710 --> 16:57.650
Bart's joint.

16:57.710 --> 16:58.650
Uh, two-ish.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.110
Be there or be square.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.450
Tell my friends?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.490
All right, but I got
some pretty funky friends.

17:04.550 --> 17:05.510
All right.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.720
I get out at noon

17:06.790 --> 17:09.089
and I'm already invited
to a party.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.130
Now, this is
a trust exercise.

17:11.190 --> 17:12.849
You fall backwards

17:12.930 --> 17:15.730
and rely on your spouse
to catch you.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.200
Do I have to do this?

17:21.270 --> 17:23.510
No, even if
your husband were here

17:23.569 --> 17:25.380
I wouldn't recommend it.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.750
As a marriage counselor,
this is the first instance

17:28.810 --> 17:32.250
where I've ever told one partner
that they were 100% right.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.910
It's all his fault.

17:33.980 --> 17:35.490
I'm willing to put that

17:35.550 --> 17:37.390
on a certificate
you can frame.

17:37.450 --> 17:38.490
♪ Over there ♪

17:38.550 --> 17:40.810
♪ Send the word, send the word ♪

17:40.890 --> 17:42.230
♪ Over there ♪

17:42.290 --> 17:45.200

17:45.260 --> 17:46.960
( <i>blast of heavy metal music )
Ahh!</i>

17:49.330 --> 17:53.100
Okay, fish, you're probably
wondering why I'm still here.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.540
Catching you

17:54.600 --> 17:57.730
will make me the most famous
fisherman there is

17:57.810 --> 18:00.180
right up there with...
the, uh...

18:00.240 --> 18:03.150
the bald guy
on the cable fishing show.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.550
Whoa!

18:06.250 --> 18:07.180
Holy mackerel!

18:09.420 --> 18:11.860
Milhouse,
didn't see you, pal.
Look out, my man.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.530
Cherry party Bart.
Any chicks over eight?

18:14.590 --> 18:16.060
Not yet, but
the afternoon is young.

18:19.190 --> 18:21.120
Lisa, what's wrong?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.070
Isn't it obvious?
We've degraded ourselves

18:23.130 --> 18:26.870
and set back the
children's rights movement
for decades to come.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.400
You're great
at a party, Lise.
Really great.

18:28.470 --> 18:29.410
Hey, you! Don't!

18:29.470 --> 18:30.440
Shut that door!

18:30.510 --> 18:31.510
Stop it!

18:31.570 --> 18:32.530
Put that away!

18:32.610 --> 18:33.540
No! Stop!

18:33.610 --> 18:35.050
Oh!

18:35.110 --> 18:36.250
Ow!

18:36.310 --> 18:37.350
( <i>laughing )</i>

18:37.410 --> 18:38.820
You young hellion.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.850
You want me
to take off my belt?

18:40.920 --> 18:41.890
Yeah.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.020
I'll show you.

18:43.080 --> 18:43.940
( <i>laughing )</i>

18:44.020 --> 18:45.060
Doggone it.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.590
( <i>grunting )</i>

18:46.650 --> 18:48.280
I love you

18:48.360 --> 18:50.260
but I must kill you.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.770
Thanks for coming.

18:56.830 --> 18:57.970
Nice tie, Nelson.

18:58.030 --> 19:00.430
Thanks. It's your dad's.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.610
( <i>crying: )
I tried to be a good baby-sitter</i>

19:03.670 --> 19:05.210
but I failed.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.840
I'm a feeb--
a useless, old, worn-down...

19:08.910 --> 19:13.350
( <i>crying )</i>

19:13.410 --> 19:15.580
Lisa, I have this
strong unpleasant feeling

19:15.650 --> 19:16.850
I've never had before.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.560
It's called remorse

19:18.620 --> 19:20.260
you vile burlesque
of irrepressible youth.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.930
How do you make this
feeling go away?

19:21.990 --> 19:23.460
You grab a bucket and a brush

19:23.520 --> 19:26.120
and you clean harder and faster
than you ever have before.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.120
( <i>crying )</i>

19:28.200 --> 19:29.130
( <i>door slams )</i>

19:29.200 --> 19:32.140

19:37.940 --> 19:39.340

19:47.320 --> 19:50.150
Uh-oh.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.390
Hi, honey.

19:51.450 --> 19:54.210
Uh... how's the marriage
retreat going?

19:54.290 --> 19:55.660
We came to this retreat

19:55.720 --> 19:57.720
because I thought
our marriage was in trouble.

19:57.790 --> 20:00.460
But I never thought
for a minute that it was
in this much trouble.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.670
Homer, how can you expect--

20:01.730 --> 20:03.670
Marge, you don't know
what this fish means.

20:03.730 --> 20:05.700
This fish represents a better
life for both of us.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.900
This fish makes me
a champion and a hero.

20:07.970 --> 20:08.940
To who?

20:09.000 --> 20:09.930
To those weirdos

20:10.000 --> 20:11.400
in the worm store.

20:11.470 --> 20:13.530
All this fish represents
is just how selfish you are.

20:13.610 --> 20:16.010
Well if that's the way you feel,
I'll throw it back.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.050
Oh, yeah, sure.

20:17.110 --> 20:18.120
Watch!

20:18.180 --> 20:19.280
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:20.780 --> 20:24.420
Wow, I did it.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.290
I gave up
fame and breakfast

20:26.350 --> 20:27.950
for my marriage.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.850
I fought it
for six hours.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.880
<i>She says one word</i>

20:30.960 --> 20:32.760
<i>and I toss it back.</i>

20:32.830 --> 20:36.000
And you're telling me
our marriage is in trouble?

20:36.060 --> 20:37.720
Come here, baby.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.140
Oh, Homer.

20:42.970 --> 20:46.080
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:46.140 --> 20:47.710
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:49.110 --> 20:51.550
Eww.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.070
Eww.

20:53.150 --> 20:54.250
Mmm.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.060
We're back.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.060
How's your
marriage?

21:05.130 --> 21:08.200
Same as usual--
perfectomundo.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.060
Oh my, the house
looks wonderful.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.940
Grandpa, what's your secret?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.500
Pretending to cry.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.170
( <i>laughing )</i>

21:15.240 --> 21:17.070
That's right,
you heard me!

21:17.140 --> 21:18.680
Pretending to cry!

21:18.740 --> 21:22.110
I can turn it on and off
like a faucet.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.350
( <i>crying )</i>

21:23.410 --> 21:25.750
Oh, I'm crying. I'm so sad.

21:25.810 --> 21:26.970
Way to go, Grampa.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.590
I'll never trust
another old person.

21:29.650 --> 21:30.920
I fooled you.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.490
So long, suckers.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.750
( <i>chuckling )</i>

21:33.820 --> 21:35.990
Yeah. General Sherman.

21:36.060 --> 21:39.330
They say he's 500 pounds
of bottom-dwelling fury.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.090
No one knows
how old he is

21:41.160 --> 21:42.570
but if you ask me,
and most people do,

21:42.630 --> 21:43.830
he's a hundred years
if he's a day.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.440
No one's ever
caught him?

21:45.500 --> 21:47.000
One fella
came close.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.810
<i>Went by the name
of Homer.</i>

21:48.870 --> 21:51.980
<i>Seven feet tall, he was,
with arms like tree trunks</i>

21:52.040 --> 21:53.810
<i>and his eyes
were like steel:
cold and hard.</i>

21:53.880 --> 21:55.480
<i>Had a shock of hair--</i>

21:55.540 --> 21:56.740
<i>red, like the fires of hell.</i>
