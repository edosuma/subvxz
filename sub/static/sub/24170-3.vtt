00:00.047 --> 00:02.015
<i>Previously on "Station 19"...</i>

00:02.040 --> 00:03.339
I chose to stop being a surgeon,

00:03.375 --> 00:04.707
but I'm not some clueless kid.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.242
Do you just not want to get married?

00:06.278 --> 00:08.984
Or do you not want to get married to me?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.742
You have cancer, Dad.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.911
Were you neglecting to tell me?

00:12.947 --> 00:14.746
I'm promoting Andrea to Lieutenant.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.715
The two of you will be
in running for Captain.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.817
Congratulations on your
recent promotion, Herrera.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.122
- Thank you.
- I remember what it took

00:20.147 --> 00:21.267
to earn my brass.

00:21.302 --> 00:22.759
There was nobody helping me out,
that's for sure.

00:22.794 --> 00:24.521
- Oh, I'm ready.
- No, you're not.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.725
- For what?
- For me. To crush you.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.093
We did face death.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.362
Yeah.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.898
I've never gotten that close before.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.673
This suits you... running things.

00:34.709 --> 00:36.596
I just changed the batteries yesterday.

00:36.596 --> 00:38.562
I was wondering if
you might be able to help me.

00:38.598 --> 00:40.064
JJ?

00:40.099 --> 00:42.466
We got to get out of here. Right now!

00:46.526 --> 00:48.072
<i>There's a thing we do in firefighting</i>

00:48.107 --> 00:49.707
<i>called "reading smoke."</i>

00:49.742 --> 00:52.143
<i>You watch the smoke billow in and out,</i>

00:52.178 --> 00:55.719
<i>dance around and study
every puff, every wisp.</i>

00:55.755 --> 00:58.249
This ice cream is gonna look
dead-ass cool at the party.

00:58.284 --> 01:00.518
Mom and Dad said we can't have
anybody over while they're gone.

01:00.553 --> 01:02.386
You want to impress Sydney B., right?

01:02.421 --> 01:04.120
And the rest of the Science Club?

01:04.157 --> 01:05.856
Freezing with nitro will do that.

01:05.892 --> 01:08.859
Trust your big sis. We'll be fine.

01:10.228 --> 01:12.596
<i>You have to understand
how the smoke moves</i>

01:12.632 --> 01:15.166
<i>if you want to contain
the fire beneath it.</i>

01:15.201 --> 01:19.436
<i>Because a lack of containment
in our line of work...</i>

01:19.472 --> 01:21.539
<i>is a recipe for disaster.</i>

01:21.574 --> 01:24.808
819 to Dispatch,
requesting additional units.

01:24.844 --> 01:26.243
Okay, put me down.

01:26.279 --> 01:28.245
I wasn't ready to leave yet.

01:28.281 --> 01:29.680
I don't think you understand
the significance

01:29.715 --> 01:31.482
of all my earthly possessions
going up in flames.

01:31.517 --> 01:33.083
You've been injured, you
need medical attention,

01:33.119 --> 01:34.485
and it's just stuff.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.986
Stuff can be replaced.

01:36.022 --> 01:38.656
My original "Purple Rain" album signed
by Prince himself is not stuff.

01:38.691 --> 01:40.024
It is everything.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.238
And you're not the boss
of me. I can go back in.

01:41.273 --> 01:43.527
Hey. You're not risking suffocation.

01:43.563 --> 01:44.828
Not even for Prince.

01:44.864 --> 01:47.398
Smoke that intense, do you think
it's spread to the walls yet?

01:47.433 --> 01:48.499
Not if we're lucky.

01:48.534 --> 01:50.100
Get on the radio. Let's call this in.

01:53.411 --> 01:57.107
<i>Ladder, Station 19,
respond, structural fire.</i>

01:57.143 --> 01:58.842
You think you will crush me?

01:58.878 --> 02:00.244
Oh, I know I will.

02:00.279 --> 02:02.346
Well, let me know when it starts
...the whole crushing me thing.

02:02.381 --> 02:03.681
I know it didn't start at blue fire,

02:03.716 --> 02:06.016
since I was clearly the one
doing the crushing there.

02:06.052 --> 02:08.384
Oh! Listen to that smack-talk.
I'm like a proud mama.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.853
I haven't had my turn yet
as acting captain yet.

02:09.889 --> 02:11.055
Just wait.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.324
Yeah, and I've still got
an hour left on my shift.

02:13.359 --> 02:15.226
You wait...
for me to crush you some more.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.795
Miller says he's starting
a top-floor evacuation.

02:17.830 --> 02:18.857
Copy that.

02:18.893 --> 02:20.197
- I can take your dad home.
- Oh, thank you.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.532
Grab some extra tanks
for Miller and Warren.

02:21.567 --> 02:22.833
Already packed, sir.

02:22.868 --> 02:24.835
And I'm right next door
if you need help with anything.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.004
- Just pick up the phone.
- Oh, is that how phones work?

02:27.039 --> 02:28.472
Only if you use 'em.

02:28.507 --> 02:30.040
Excuse me.

02:30.076 --> 02:32.543
- Got to get through.
- Captain?

02:32.578 --> 02:34.478
Yes. Yeah.

02:34.513 --> 02:36.880
Ready to roll.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.484
Dad, go home.

02:42.822 --> 02:45.623
Guess it's just you and me now, sir.

02:45.658 --> 02:47.918
Don't remind me.

02:48.527 --> 02:50.828
So, that stuff back there with Jack,

02:50.863 --> 02:53.998
was that a "we just got it on
in the turnout room" smack talk?

02:54.033 --> 02:55.232
Or "we almost got it on

02:55.268 --> 02:57.101
but got interrupted
by the alarm" smack talk?

02:57.136 --> 02:59.737
Or "we're really confused
because we're in competition

02:59.772 --> 03:01.839
but just drove through
blue fire which was really hot,

03:01.874 --> 03:03.774
but we still haven't talked
about that engagement ring

03:03.809 --> 03:05.376
hanging over our heads yet" sma...

03:05.411 --> 03:07.511
Ah. Yes. That's the one.

03:07.546 --> 03:10.581
See, you can keep Jack
a secret from the station,

03:10.616 --> 03:13.350
but you can't keep secrets from me.

03:13.386 --> 03:15.753
Don't even try.

03:18.424 --> 03:20.357
Miller, fill me in.

03:20.393 --> 03:22.459
Evidence there's still alarm
on the top floor.

03:22.495 --> 03:24.395
Smoke was visible on ceiling inspection.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.963
I think the origin
is somewhere in the attic.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.164
Looks to be pretty by-the-book.

03:27.199 --> 03:29.300
Let's do a full evac on the building!

03:29.335 --> 03:30.334
Better vent.

03:30.369 --> 03:31.602
Warren, you want to head up the sounding?

03:31.637 --> 03:33.871
- Absolutely.
- All right. Nice and easy, guys.

03:33.906 --> 03:36.006
No big swings today. Let's go!

03:37.743 --> 03:39.543
So you're the guy who runs back in
when everyone else is running out.

03:39.578 --> 03:41.645
- I am.
- That's terrifying.

03:41.681 --> 03:43.847
Why on earth would you
choose a job like that?

03:43.916 --> 03:46.550
Didn't have much choice after
flunking out of mime school.

03:46.585 --> 03:48.211
Stupid invisible box.

03:49.155 --> 03:51.255
Got to head back in.
Don't go wandering around.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.556
You fell pretty hard.

03:52.591 --> 03:54.291
If you happen to grab
my signed "Purple Rain" album,

03:54.327 --> 03:55.259
I won't be mad.

03:55.294 --> 03:56.894
Nope.

03:56.929 --> 03:58.262
Spoke to the building manager.

03:58.297 --> 04:00.497
He says plumbers
were fusing pipes in the attic.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.433
I inspected this building
a couple weeks back.

04:02.468 --> 04:03.867
It's got some ratty insulation.

04:03.903 --> 04:05.769
- Could've been smoldering for days.
- Good to know.

04:05.805 --> 04:08.105
Just a taste there... my crushing.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.708
Oh, okay. See?
That's what you think that was?

04:12.244 --> 04:14.178
Morning, Chief.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.612
Uh, primary search is in progress,

04:15.648 --> 04:17.113
hoses heading inside.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.416
Need a pressure release upstairs.
Heading up to the roof right now.

04:19.452 --> 04:21.685
I heard about the blue-fire tanker
this morning. Hell of a first shift.

04:21.721 --> 04:22.885
Shift's not over yet.

04:22.921 --> 04:24.588
Still have time to knock one more out.

04:24.623 --> 04:26.557
Kissing up to the chief?

04:26.592 --> 04:28.826
Oh, I don't have to kiss up.

04:28.861 --> 04:31.662
My crushing speaks for itself.

04:35.601 --> 04:38.535
Warren, tell me why we vent
the roof of structure fires.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.604
Uh, ventilation pulls the fire
up and out of the building,

04:40.639 --> 04:43.006
preventing air
from fueling the fire inside.

04:43.042 --> 04:45.109
That means less spread, less damage.

04:45.144 --> 04:46.844
It's pretty genius, actually.

04:46.879 --> 04:48.579
Okay, your enthusiasm's
at a 10 right now.

04:48.614 --> 04:50.147
I need you to bring it back down to a 5.

04:50.182 --> 04:51.482
Of course I'm at a 10.

04:51.517 --> 04:54.385
Look, I just survived a ring
of invisible blue fire, okay?

04:54.420 --> 04:56.220
And now, this! It's... It's a rush.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.655
It's like, uh... It's like
every time I step into the O.R.,

04:58.691 --> 04:59.757
I got to do a Whipple.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.425
I have no idea what that means,

05:01.460 --> 05:02.726
but yes, this job can be a rush,

05:02.762 --> 05:04.027
but you can't live in it all the time.

05:04.063 --> 05:05.829
Dial it back. Recalibrate a little.

05:08.968 --> 05:11.368
He clearly didn't hear
anything you just said.

05:11.404 --> 05:14.171
That tanker fire just happened
a few hours ago.

05:14.206 --> 05:15.472
That's a lot for anyone to take in,

05:15.508 --> 05:16.640
especially a probie.

05:20.045 --> 05:21.111
Mm-hmm.

05:21.147 --> 05:25.716
A building that big should make the news.

05:25.751 --> 05:28.118
Show me some chopper coverage.

05:28.154 --> 05:29.520
I figured I'd swing by the pharmacy

05:29.555 --> 05:31.588
to grab your post-op meds.

05:31.624 --> 05:33.928
Oh, you're still here. Why?

05:34.789 --> 05:36.293
You need anything else while I'm out?

05:36.328 --> 05:38.996
Does Seattle P.D. know
that you used to hot-wire cars?

05:39.031 --> 05:42.232
You can't still be holding onto that.
I was 12.

05:42.268 --> 05:44.001
And for the record, it was Andy's idea.

05:44.036 --> 05:47.137
Was it also Andy's idea
that you break my garage window?

05:47.173 --> 05:49.239
Okay. I'm an adult now.

05:49.275 --> 05:50.541
That's ancient history.

05:50.576 --> 05:54.211
I'm an excellent neighbor,
I protect, I-I serve,

05:54.246 --> 05:56.013
I help little old ladies
cross the street.

05:56.048 --> 05:58.148
That's your job.
They pay you for that, yes?

05:58.184 --> 06:01.885
Look, you just had surgery
and I'm trying to be neighborly,

06:01.921 --> 06:05.289
because believe it or not,
I care if you live or die.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.357
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

06:07.393 --> 06:10.994
But buttering me up won't
get you in my daughter's pants.

06:12.444 --> 06:14.164
- What?
- You heard me.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.667
No. I'm sorry, sir,
but that's... insulting.

06:16.702 --> 06:18.001
And I'm just trying to help.

06:18.037 --> 06:19.203
Your help is not a thing I need.

06:19.238 --> 06:20.737
So...

06:45.130 --> 06:48.501
Welcome to your first
roof ventilation, Warren.

06:48.536 --> 06:50.079
What do we do when we sound?

06:50.115 --> 06:52.169
We move from one side
of the roof to the other,

06:52.204 --> 06:53.704
tapping the roof as we go

06:53.739 --> 06:55.606
with, uh, with these babies.

06:55.641 --> 06:57.608
What are we looking for?

06:57.643 --> 06:58.842
The fire's location.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.511
Hard roof, it's cool underneath.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.180
Spongy roof, it's trouble below.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.315
Hey, easy, Warren!
Don't step just anywhere!

07:05.351 --> 07:06.817
Stick to the beams
or you could fall through!

07:06.852 --> 07:08.418
Copy that.

07:15.027 --> 07:18.028
Fire department! This is an evacuation.

07:19.999 --> 07:23.066
Fire department! You need to evacuate!

07:26.071 --> 07:29.106
Smack talk Jack again.
I can't get enough.

07:29.141 --> 07:31.408
You know I can hear you, right?

07:31.443 --> 07:33.277
I think that's the point!

07:33.312 --> 07:35.913
Actually, the point is,
we're here to vent the building.

07:37.049 --> 07:38.882
Shoot! My hook is stuck.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.951
Hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy,
easy! Don't lean out too far.

07:40.986 --> 07:43.153
Or it'll go down
and you'll go down with it.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.891
Here you go. I'll get you out.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.094
A little more.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

08:07.677 --> 08:08.977
Warren, you okay?

08:09.012 --> 08:10.868
I'm more than okay. That was unreal!

08:10.904 --> 08:12.756
Yeah. Unreal.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.483
Take it easy up here. You've had
enough surprises for one shift.

08:15.518 --> 08:16.718
That flare-up means

08:16.753 --> 08:18.653
the fire's more aggressive
than we anticipated.

08:18.688 --> 08:20.488
Warren, see those pipes?

08:20.523 --> 08:21.990
Uh, pipes? Yeah, yeah, I see them.

08:22.025 --> 08:24.750
- Good. Keep doing that.
- Keep seeing them?

08:24.791 --> 08:26.348
Report any changes to me.

08:26.384 --> 08:28.796
Changes? Am I being hazed?

08:28.832 --> 08:31.381
Chief, fire's hungry on the Delta side.

08:31.416 --> 08:32.601
We had a flare-up.

08:32.635 --> 08:34.688
Then crank it up, Herrera.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.356
All right, time to make a heat hole.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.457
Alpha, Bravo corner.
Bishop, start cutting.

08:38.493 --> 08:40.693
On it! Hughes, let's cut this baby open,

08:40.729 --> 08:42.162
see what we're working with!

08:42.197 --> 08:43.715
Okay, let's do that.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.465
Heat hole's gonna cost us time!

08:45.500 --> 08:48.001
Jack and I know this building!
The attic's one big open space!

08:48.036 --> 08:49.441
A fire could tear through it fast!

08:49.442 --> 08:51.175
I'm trying to avoid that, Montgomery.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.077
I say we cut straight to cutting strips,

08:53.112 --> 08:54.211
draw the fire to it,

08:54.246 --> 08:55.946
and that'll stop the blaze in its tracks.

08:55.982 --> 08:57.114
There are steps...

08:57.149 --> 08:59.383
actual, very clear steps to follow here.

08:59.418 --> 09:01.218
I'm not skipping half of them
on your whim.

09:01.253 --> 09:03.887
- So, do you want us to start cutting?
- Yes, yeah, start cutting!

09:03.923 --> 09:05.689
Look, if the heat hole works on its own,

09:05.725 --> 09:07.224
it'll preserve way more structure overall

09:07.259 --> 09:08.392
than jumping right to the strips.

09:08.427 --> 09:09.727
We're gonna end up there anyway.

09:09.762 --> 09:11.295
If we wait too long,

09:11.330 --> 09:12.730
we're gonna lose our shot at it, Andy.

09:12.765 --> 09:14.898
It's Captain... today.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.800
And this is my call. No strip.

09:16.836 --> 09:18.569
Not yet. Yes, Captain.

09:18.604 --> 09:20.119
Keep cutting.

09:23.242 --> 09:24.241
Hey.

09:24.276 --> 09:25.576
Need another breathing treatment.

09:25.611 --> 09:27.251
We got some minor lacerations
on his hand.

09:27.286 --> 09:29.913
Hey, how are you? Is your head okay?

09:29.949 --> 09:32.116
- Any dizziness?
- Uh, a little.

09:32.151 --> 09:33.956
Sorry, I was just checking
to see if my friend got my text.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.246
- Yeah.
- He's at work right now,

09:35.281 --> 09:37.254
but he lives down the hall
from me... or lived.

09:37.289 --> 09:39.823
- God, is there gonna be anything left?
- She means Seth.

09:39.859 --> 09:42.159
I don't know his last name,
but that's her boyfriend.

09:42.194 --> 09:44.261
Not boyfriend-boyfriend.

09:44.296 --> 09:46.730
More like a-a hook-up friend...

09:46.766 --> 09:47.931
who lives close.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.667
Yeah, he's a giver more than a keeper.

09:49.702 --> 09:50.901
Yeah, I'll stop talking about him now.

09:50.936 --> 09:52.803
Any luck on finding "Purple Rain"?

09:52.838 --> 09:54.605
Just pay attention if
your dizziness gets any worse.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.907
You're not checking <i> me</i> out much.

09:56.942 --> 09:59.610
Company 19, is the primary
evacuation complete?

09:59.645 --> 10:01.812
I need every civilian
out of this building.

10:01.847 --> 10:03.947
Someone will look after you.

10:03.983 --> 10:05.916
- Got to head back in.
- Now!

10:05.951 --> 10:08.152
Oh.

10:10.189 --> 10:12.923
Come on, lady! Show me your face!

10:12.958 --> 10:14.591
Heat hole's almost complete, Chief.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.460
Interior team should stand by with hoses,

10:16.495 --> 10:17.494
ready for attack.

10:17.530 --> 10:19.296
Pruitt would've let you do the strip!

10:19.331 --> 10:20.397
Yep.

10:20.433 --> 10:21.965
How are those pipes, Warren?

10:22.001 --> 10:23.500
Still piping.

10:23.536 --> 10:25.636
Definitely being hazed.

10:25.671 --> 10:27.438
Let's just start your strip!

10:27.473 --> 10:29.206
I know you want to
slice and dice, Gibson.

10:29.241 --> 10:30.841
I get it. We all get it.

10:30.876 --> 10:33.444
Captain, report your status.

10:33.479 --> 10:35.846
Come on.

10:35.881 --> 10:38.649
Herrera, report in! Do you copy?

10:38.684 --> 10:40.617
Yes, Chief, I copy. I'm here.

10:42.288 --> 10:45.956
And what is your status?

10:50.229 --> 10:52.162
Show me what you're made of!

10:53.899 --> 10:55.499
Herrera!

10:56.502 --> 10:59.336
Whoo! There she is!

10:59.371 --> 11:01.171
Heat hole's completed, Chief!

11:01.207 --> 11:03.006
Ready for waterworks inside!

11:03.042 --> 11:05.509
We're hitting it from the inside.

11:05.544 --> 11:07.144
Come on, now. That's enough now.

11:07.179 --> 11:09.747
- Heat hole isn't working!
- Give it a minute!

11:09.782 --> 11:12.282
The release will start to work
and the fire will die down.

11:12.318 --> 11:14.651
Huh?

11:16.188 --> 11:18.655
Captain! Permission to rip a strip?!

11:18.691 --> 11:20.557
Not yet!

11:20.593 --> 11:23.660
Herrera, we are hitting it
from the inside.

11:23.696 --> 11:26.196
What's the status on top?

11:28.634 --> 11:30.267
Herrera!

11:30.302 --> 11:32.336
The fire is still going
too strong. It's not enough.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.476
Cut the strip, Gibson!

11:39.512 --> 11:41.712
Hughes, Bishop, bring up the rear!

11:49.622 --> 11:51.588
Seattle fire department!

11:51.624 --> 11:53.991
If anyone is in there, call out!

11:54.026 --> 11:57.361
Here! In here!

11:57.396 --> 11:58.328
Aah!

11:58.364 --> 11:59.830
All right, we're coming in!

12:02.501 --> 12:03.834
Call out!

12:03.869 --> 12:06.003
- Here!
- Where are you? Call out again!

12:06.038 --> 12:08.272
I'm in here! The door's blocked!

12:08.307 --> 12:10.674
One, two, three!

12:10.709 --> 12:11.975
Over here!

12:12.011 --> 12:14.278
We're coming! We're coming!

12:14.313 --> 12:16.580
Down the hall.

12:16.615 --> 12:17.714
My friend's a deep sleeper.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.283
Her smoke alarm's broken.

12:19.318 --> 12:21.685
- You have to get to her.
- The floor's all clear, all right?

12:21.720 --> 12:23.053
You're the last one out. Come on.

12:25.858 --> 12:28.058
Oh, God! All right, we got to move!

12:28.093 --> 12:29.893
We got to move now. Come on.

12:31.530 --> 12:33.363
Come on!

12:35.634 --> 12:37.801
You know, I-I also have
a chainsaw, Captain.

12:37.837 --> 12:38.802
I could jump...

12:38.838 --> 12:40.304
You could talk to me about those pipes!

12:41.307 --> 12:42.472
Nothing to talk about.

12:42.508 --> 12:43.640
Just how I like it.

12:43.676 --> 12:46.176
Yeah. Me, too.

12:48.747 --> 12:52.316
Here we go on three.
One, two, three. Open up!

13:03.295 --> 13:04.828
Nothing's happening.

13:04.864 --> 13:05.929
Wait for it.

13:05.965 --> 13:07.364
Come on, come on, come on.

13:16.408 --> 13:18.408
Yeah!

13:18.444 --> 13:20.244
Love a good strip!

13:20.279 --> 13:21.578
Chief, we've cut the fire off.

13:21.614 --> 13:22.579
Copy that.

13:22.615 --> 13:25.482
Go on. Gloat if you want to gloat.

13:25.517 --> 13:28.151
No need. Strip speaks for itself.

13:29.121 --> 13:31.021
- Are we wrapping up here, Captain?
- Yeah.

13:31.056 --> 13:32.522
You got somewhere to be, probie?

13:32.558 --> 13:34.091
Well, it would appear
that my good friends,

13:34.126 --> 13:35.459
the pipes here, are growing.

13:35.494 --> 13:37.027
Either that or this roof is sinking.

13:37.062 --> 13:38.829
They've grown several inches
in the last few seconds.

13:38.864 --> 13:41.431
You heard him, guys!
Let's get boots on the ground!

13:41.467 --> 13:43.867
Roof's losing its integrity.
We're headed down.

13:43.903 --> 13:45.602
Time to wrap up the evac inside!

13:45.638 --> 13:47.771
How much longer
you think this roof's got?

13:47.806 --> 13:49.373
Pipes grew what, six inches?

13:49.408 --> 13:50.874
Yeah, yeah, about that.

13:50.910 --> 13:54.144
I'd say it'll be nearly
a full collapse in 30 seconds,

13:54.179 --> 13:55.212
give or take.

14:08.827 --> 14:11.161
Everyone's down?

14:11.196 --> 14:13.730
- Yes, ma'am. Everybody's out?
- No, not everybody.

14:13.766 --> 14:15.499
Dean's still in there.
Shouldn't he be out by now?

14:15.534 --> 14:17.087
How long ago did he go in?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.524
He and his team are doing a final sweep.

14:18.549 --> 14:19.861
No, that roof's not stable.

14:19.905 --> 14:21.171
I told you to get them all out.

14:21.206 --> 14:22.773
I updated him on the roof's status.

14:22.808 --> 14:23.966
He knows what he's dealing with.

14:24.002 --> 14:27.277
You have to pull him out. He won't
leave without a direct order.

14:27.313 --> 14:28.779
He'll just keep looking for tenants.

14:28.814 --> 14:30.881
Herrera, I know how to run a scene.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.983
I am looking out for my people.

14:33.018 --> 14:34.685
We don't risk sacrificing lives.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.119
We save and protect them.

14:36.155 --> 14:37.688
Pull him out.

14:37.723 --> 14:38.952
Got him!

14:38.988 --> 14:40.223
Let's go, let's go!

14:40.259 --> 14:41.858
Give me a hand!

14:42.928 --> 14:45.028
Here. Watch his head.

14:45.064 --> 14:46.330
We got him.

14:46.365 --> 14:48.598
I didn't think I'd see you again.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.434
- That was so scary.
- Hey, baby.

14:50.469 --> 14:51.969
Seth?

14:52.004 --> 14:53.737
Wait. Wait, you weren't at work?

14:53.772 --> 14:55.605
Where... Are you okay?

14:55.641 --> 14:56.640
Are <i> you</i> okay?

14:56.675 --> 14:58.442
All right, let's go.

15:00.145 --> 15:02.079
I'm so glad you're okay.

15:02.114 --> 15:03.146
Yeah, me, too.

15:03.182 --> 15:05.115
'Cause that was a top-floor rescue.

15:09.788 --> 15:10.921
Hey.

15:10.956 --> 15:12.770
And the roof just collapsed.

15:16.557 --> 15:18.099
Possible fractured right-side tibia,

15:18.124 --> 15:20.069
prolonged smoke exposure,
so the airway's burning.

15:20.094 --> 15:21.160
Keep an eye on his lungs.

15:21.195 --> 15:22.728
Seth! Oh, God, are you okay?

15:24.432 --> 15:26.145
What Seth is trying to say is no.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.367
He's not okay until the hospital says so.

15:28.403 --> 15:30.136
Also that in the future,

15:30.171 --> 15:33.205
he'll be bolting large pieces
of furniture to the wall.

15:37.345 --> 15:39.883
I-I'm gonna go to the hospital with him.

15:39.919 --> 15:41.129
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, 'cause it's, you know,

15:41.165 --> 15:42.569
the right thing to do, as a human.

15:42.604 --> 15:44.183
- Correct.
- Not as a girlfriend human, though.

15:44.218 --> 15:46.218
Just a human human, so we're clear.

15:55.064 --> 15:57.396
You and your fireflies. She's not.

15:57.432 --> 15:59.799
Fireflies follow us around.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.669
The universe sent <i> me</i> to <i> her.</i>

16:03.705 --> 16:06.138
Her-er-er-er-er-er-er.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.946
Post-incident eval... walk me through.

16:08.981 --> 16:10.109
We started with a heat hole.

16:10.144 --> 16:12.712
- But I recommended a strip.
- And I took your recommendation.

16:12.747 --> 16:14.680
Not right away.
I told you I know this building.

16:14.716 --> 16:16.949
- We could've skipped that.
- I don't skip steps when we...

16:16.984 --> 16:18.050
Enough.

16:18.086 --> 16:19.151
On the ground,
this call sounded like chaos.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.713
Listening to you now, it's worse.

16:20.749 --> 16:22.390
Gibson, I hear arguing.

16:22.426 --> 16:23.843
You don't argue with your chief

16:23.879 --> 16:25.348
and you don't argue with your captain.

16:25.383 --> 16:27.059
That's how calls go sideways
and people get hurt.

16:27.095 --> 16:28.475
Yes, Chief.

16:28.502 --> 16:30.769
Herrera, your lieutenant
had relevant experience

16:30.804 --> 16:33.371
with this structure...
experience that you ignored

16:33.407 --> 16:35.740
when you could have
used it to your advantage.

16:35.776 --> 16:37.742
Captains lead by utilizing their teams

16:37.778 --> 16:39.177
to the best of their ability,

16:39.212 --> 16:40.678
especially their lieutenants.

16:40.714 --> 16:42.747
And lieutenants need to listen
and follow commands.

16:42.783 --> 16:44.082
Yes, Chief.

16:44.117 --> 16:46.151
- Of course, Chief.
- I'm not a kindergarten teacher.

16:46.186 --> 16:47.786
Do better!

16:47.821 --> 16:50.221
Figure out how to run
this station together

16:50.257 --> 16:52.829
or, believe me, I will find
someone else who can.

16:53.827 --> 16:55.627
Let's go.

16:58.331 --> 17:00.432
You know, it's kind of weird,

17:00.467 --> 17:03.735
being in the middle
of somebody's stuff like this.

17:03.770 --> 17:05.904
In the O.R., everyone's draped,

17:05.939 --> 17:07.605
there's no stuff with anybody.

17:07.641 --> 17:10.275
Here, you get to know things
about a person.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.143
It's like, uh... like, uh...

17:12.179 --> 17:14.612
like how the woman who lived here was...

17:14.647 --> 17:17.549
was, uh, reading
"Living the Vegan Life" while...

17:17.584 --> 17:19.851
while snacking on beef jerky.

17:19.886 --> 17:23.354
It's, I don't know... it's personal.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.190
It's, uh, intimate.

17:25.224 --> 17:27.459
Yeah, you know, it's just,
uh, overhaul, Warren.

17:27.493 --> 17:29.094
You don't need to write a poem about it.

17:29.129 --> 17:32.430
No. I mean, I like how personal it feels.

17:32.466 --> 17:34.699
Look, man, here's a word of advice.

17:34.734 --> 17:35.867
You're new to this.

17:35.902 --> 17:37.869
Making it personal isn't good.

17:37.904 --> 17:39.237
If you let yourself get personal

17:39.272 --> 17:41.372
with your saves or your losses,

17:41.408 --> 17:43.908
you'll overload, freeze up.

17:43.944 --> 17:46.411
And then you'll find yourself
drowning in...

17:46.446 --> 17:48.246
Yes!

17:48.281 --> 17:49.581
I found it.

17:49.616 --> 17:50.648
Found what?

17:50.684 --> 17:52.221
Huh? Nothin'.

17:53.153 --> 17:56.888
Look, if you find yourself
getting attached,

17:56.923 --> 17:58.289
you shut it off,

17:58.325 --> 18:00.658
you put it up in a shelf
and you lock it away.

18:00.694 --> 18:03.561
Because they won't get you anywhere good.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.598
That's what you do?

18:06.633 --> 18:09.534
Yeah. Damn right I do.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.477
You know, there's a reason

18:19.513 --> 18:21.279
the textbook says heat hole first.

18:21.314 --> 18:22.680
It's lets you take a peek

18:22.716 --> 18:25.316
before you tear the whole roof
open with a damn strip.

18:25.352 --> 18:26.784
I mean, you taught me that.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.153
Oh, I love a good strip.

18:28.188 --> 18:29.554
Frankel only made it an issue

18:29.589 --> 18:31.156
because I questioned her judgement.

18:33.527 --> 18:36.194
I'm gonna say something
you're not gonna like.

18:36.229 --> 18:37.929
Okay. You're spoiled.

18:38.476 --> 18:40.932
Excuse me?

18:40.967 --> 18:44.102
I always encouraged you
to speak up as your dad,

18:44.137 --> 18:46.504
as your captain, but with Frankel,

18:46.540 --> 18:49.307
you got to be a little more... political.

18:49.342 --> 18:51.576
I am not playing politics

18:51.611 --> 18:53.044
when it comes to the lives of my crew.

18:53.079 --> 18:54.445
You're not eating.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.282
Well, it's hard to work up an appetite

18:57.317 --> 18:58.783
at radiation treatment.

19:00.654 --> 19:02.587
Made some calls today to some old friends

19:02.622 --> 19:03.888
about finding me a job.

19:03.924 --> 19:05.438
- What?
- Well, nothing fancy.

19:05.474 --> 19:08.660
Just sitting at a desk,
maybe answer a phone.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.330
I-I can't just sit around here
all day, every day.

19:12.365 --> 19:14.933
- It's been less than 48 hours.
- I need something to do.

19:14.968 --> 19:16.868
You have something to do...
heal your body.

19:16.903 --> 19:18.002
Do that.

19:18.038 --> 19:19.537
I can heal just as well

19:19.573 --> 19:20.806
sitting at a desk
as I can stuck on that couch.

19:20.841 --> 19:22.740
Incorrect. At a desk, you help others.

19:22.776 --> 19:24.209
At home, you help you.

19:24.244 --> 19:27.549
And you really need
to help you right now.

19:27.585 --> 19:29.714
This isn't a common cold, Dad.

19:29.749 --> 19:31.849
- It's cancer.
- I'm aware.

19:33.887 --> 19:35.825
But I'm not that hungry.

19:51.938 --> 19:53.738
Hey, it's me.

19:53.773 --> 19:56.007
What are you doing right now?

19:56.042 --> 19:57.722
I could use some company.

19:59.015 --> 20:01.713
I'm so glad to see you.

20:03.850 --> 20:05.750
Beer. That's cute.

20:05.785 --> 20:08.253
- I brought vodka.
- You know, my dad is...

20:09.456 --> 20:11.155
I don't know what to do with him.

20:11.191 --> 20:12.991
He... He's refusing to stay home,

20:13.026 --> 20:15.026
he thinks he needs to get some desk job.

20:15.061 --> 20:17.362
Then I made the mistake
of talking to him about Frankel.

20:17.397 --> 20:18.496
Pause.

20:18.531 --> 20:20.331
For a toast to your first day as captain

20:20.367 --> 20:22.300
and one hell of a first shift.

20:22.335 --> 20:23.468
You murdered it.

20:23.503 --> 20:25.937
I will day-drink to that.

20:27.007 --> 20:28.406
Frankel didn't see it that way.

20:28.441 --> 20:29.474
Mm.

20:29.509 --> 20:31.542
Well, Frankel doesn't pay compliments

20:31.578 --> 20:33.011
because she never got them.

20:33.046 --> 20:34.445
She had it tough coming up.

20:34.481 --> 20:35.780
Yeah, and she thinks I didn't.

20:35.815 --> 20:36.881
You didn't.

20:36.916 --> 20:38.049
Well, not like her.

20:38.084 --> 20:40.018
None of us did, partly <i> thanks</i> to her.

20:40.053 --> 20:42.153
True. And that's true.

20:42.188 --> 20:43.421
To Frankel.

20:43.456 --> 20:45.523
- To Andy.
- To vodka.

20:47.260 --> 20:49.827
Day-drinking is a good first step,

20:49.863 --> 20:51.462
but you need to treat yourself.

20:51.498 --> 20:53.965
Yeah, I-I was thinking
I might head out to Gold Bar

20:54.000 --> 20:55.533
and get in a good rock climb.

20:55.568 --> 20:57.502
Your treats and my treats
are not the same.

20:57.537 --> 20:58.803
I like to climb.

20:58.838 --> 21:01.306
It... It gets me out of my head.
Maya, you run all the time.

21:01.341 --> 21:03.341
That is <i> self-discipline,</i> not <i> self-care.</i>

21:03.376 --> 21:05.109
And what is <i>your</i> self-care?

21:05.145 --> 21:07.178
Oh, lots and lots of sex.

21:07.213 --> 21:09.113
I highly recommend it.

21:09.149 --> 21:11.516
- New lady on the horizon?
- Spill.

21:11.551 --> 21:14.819
More like a series of ladies and gents.

21:14.854 --> 21:17.322
Monogamy is for the weak.

21:17.357 --> 21:19.824
Or the very, very dedicated.

21:19.859 --> 21:21.959
Mm. A man with a badge approaching.

21:21.995 --> 21:24.262
And it might be the vodka talking,

21:24.297 --> 21:26.364
but he looks very chiseled
in the daylight...

21:26.399 --> 21:28.599
Uh, slow your roll, Hughes.
We don't double dip.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.160
Double dip? Who dipped?

21:30.195 --> 21:31.570
Mm.

21:31.606 --> 21:33.871
Oh. Herrera. Okay. Respect.

21:33.907 --> 21:35.139
I'm gonna need details.

21:35.175 --> 21:36.140
Shh. Stop.

21:36.176 --> 21:37.809
Specific and elaborate details!

21:37.844 --> 21:39.744
Technically, I could cite
all three of you

21:39.779 --> 21:41.212
for public consumption
and open containers.

21:42.415 --> 21:43.548
This is private property.
That is not cool.

21:43.583 --> 21:44.515
Guys, guys, he's kidding.

21:47.354 --> 21:49.487
Uh, you... you off duty?

21:49.522 --> 21:50.934
How's your dad?

21:50.969 --> 21:52.724
Oh, walked all the way over here

21:52.759 --> 21:54.292
- to talk about her dad, did you?
- Hmm.

21:54.327 --> 21:57.195
Actually, uh, I'd hoped to catch
Andy alone for a minute,

21:57.230 --> 21:58.830
but that can wait.

21:58.865 --> 22:00.965
Are you sure?
We... We can go inside if...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.468
No. No, it's not... It's fine.

22:03.973 --> 22:06.037
I should go. Talk later.

22:07.407 --> 22:09.107
Don't drink and drive, okay?

22:10.143 --> 22:11.676
All right.

22:11.711 --> 22:13.211
Hmm.

22:13.246 --> 22:16.714
He looks just as good walking away.

22:16.750 --> 22:20.151
Well-dipped, Herrera. Well-dipped.

22:29.635 --> 22:31.668
You're here early.

22:31.704 --> 22:34.073
Yeah. I wanted to get a jump on things.

22:34.108 --> 22:35.526
I approved the overtime requests,

22:35.562 --> 22:36.742
ordered tank replacements,

22:36.777 --> 22:38.775
e-mailed volunteers
about the pancake fundraiser,

22:38.811 --> 22:41.345
and now coffee.

22:41.380 --> 22:42.813
You seem...

22:42.848 --> 22:44.548
right at home.

22:45.784 --> 22:47.351
Well, then, do you want to talk about

22:47.386 --> 22:49.519
the admin forms I filled out
as captain from the last shift?

22:49.555 --> 22:51.521
- No, I got myself up to speed.
- My dad and I, we...

22:51.557 --> 22:54.558
Okay. Well, then the O2
tanks need to be checked.

22:54.593 --> 22:56.393
- I can do that.
- Already done.

22:56.428 --> 22:58.262
And in the future, I want people
to check their own tanks.

22:58.297 --> 23:00.163
I don't like micromanaging.

23:00.199 --> 23:01.898
I'm... I'm just trying to help.

23:01.934 --> 23:03.834
I'll let you know if I need any.

23:05.433 --> 23:06.536
Thanks, Lieutenant.

23:16.582 --> 23:18.949
All right, let's get started.

23:18.984 --> 23:20.317
Roll call time.

23:20.352 --> 23:23.086
I just want to say
that I've cleaned the showers

23:23.122 --> 23:25.554
two shifts in a row,
and I'm ready to move on.

23:26.959 --> 23:29.660
Then I got good news for you, Montgomery.

23:29.695 --> 23:31.295
I'm switching it up.

23:31.330 --> 23:32.683
No one has to scrub the showers.

23:32.718 --> 23:34.285
At least not right now.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.499
Say what now?

23:35.534 --> 23:37.234
Look, obviously, it's got to get done.

23:37.269 --> 23:39.536
But on my shift, there are no hard rules.

23:39.571 --> 23:41.640
As long as chores are done
by the end of the day,

23:41.676 --> 23:42.873
I'm fine.

23:42.908 --> 23:44.508
I trust everyone can manage their time.

23:48.147 --> 23:49.579
Sure. Me, too.

23:49.615 --> 23:51.132
I-I trust everyone.

23:51.167 --> 23:53.984
But "B" shift
raided our pantry last night

23:54.019 --> 23:55.485
and left the bathrooms pretty rank.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.555
Maybe we should clean up,
then re-stock in that order,

23:58.590 --> 24:00.324
- like we always do.
- Like I said,

24:00.359 --> 24:03.527
you'll manage your own schedule
or just get it done.

24:03.562 --> 24:06.096
- Copy that.
- Will do.

24:06.131 --> 24:07.998
- Good.
- Yep.

24:08.033 --> 24:10.000
It's good, right?

24:10.035 --> 24:11.868
Yeah, it's really good. Thank you.

24:11.904 --> 24:13.437
Yeah, it's really good man.

24:17.343 --> 24:20.077
Sticking to schedule.

24:20.112 --> 24:21.545
You're a wild woman, Herrera.

24:21.580 --> 24:22.679
I like the schedule.

24:22.715 --> 24:25.148
The schedule keeps us safe and on task.

24:25.184 --> 24:28.652
The schedule makes me all warm
and fuzzy inside.

24:28.687 --> 24:32.289
So, you know how you wanted
your dad to stay home?

24:38.864 --> 24:40.364
You always have to dial 9 to get out.

24:40.399 --> 24:43.133
- I understand. It's the transfer...
- Dad. Dad, what are you doing here?

24:43.168 --> 24:44.568
Working reception, if I can ever
figure out the system.

24:44.603 --> 24:45.769
Yeah, reception,

24:45.804 --> 24:48.105
where germy strangers
walk in and out every day,

24:48.140 --> 24:50.741
when your immune system is compromised.

24:50.776 --> 24:52.500
- You did this.
- It was my idea.

24:52.535 --> 24:54.111
I approved it, yes.

24:55.114 --> 24:57.013
Ah. Shh! Duty calls.

24:58.817 --> 25:02.308
Good morning. Seattle Fire
Department, Station 19.

25:02.343 --> 25:04.611
This is Pruitt speaking.
How can I help you?

25:05.343 --> 25:07.904
O-Okay, I knew you weren't
gonna be wild about this,

25:07.939 --> 25:09.037
but just hear me out.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.597
- Office. Now.
- Okay.

25:10.632 --> 25:12.281
Yes, ma'am.

25:16.054 --> 25:17.520
Why would you hire my father
to work here?

25:18.656 --> 25:20.223
Just... why?!

25:20.258 --> 25:21.357
He'll, uh...

25:21.392 --> 25:23.159
He'll work reception, answer some phones.

25:23.194 --> 25:25.528
At most, he'll give the walk-ins
their BP checks.

25:25.563 --> 25:27.964
Look, if he's gonna work a desk
somewhere, it might as well be here.

25:27.999 --> 25:30.066
He's my dad. Not yours.

25:30.101 --> 25:31.400
He's my captain.

25:31.436 --> 25:33.636
I got a call from Station 23,

25:33.671 --> 25:35.905
asking me to recommend him
for a job over there.

25:35.940 --> 25:37.206
That's clear across town.

25:37.242 --> 25:40.142
I said no, 'cause we could be closer.

25:40.178 --> 25:42.979
It's like you think you're
trying to help me or something.

25:43.014 --> 25:44.046
But you're not.

25:44.082 --> 25:45.681
Having him under-foot all the time,

25:45.717 --> 25:47.216
watching over our shoulders...

25:47.252 --> 25:48.584
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

25:48.620 --> 25:50.219
I value his input.

25:50.255 --> 25:51.408
Okay.

25:52.190 --> 25:53.789
I see.

25:53.825 --> 25:56.058
A-And you didn't think
to even give me a heads-up,

25:56.094 --> 25:57.581
because...?

25:58.495 --> 25:59.962
Bye-bye.

25:59.998 --> 26:02.064
Unbelievable.

26:03.701 --> 26:05.468
W-Why is it such a big deal?

26:20.551 --> 26:23.185
You can't let them get to you.

26:23.221 --> 26:24.487
Shut it off. Put it away.

26:24.522 --> 26:25.788
Jack's in charge for five minutes

26:25.823 --> 26:27.456
and he's already changing
every single thing.

26:27.492 --> 26:28.457
Hey, can I help?

26:28.493 --> 26:30.059
Well, I'm basically already d...

26:30.094 --> 26:31.727
Okay. Well, yeah. Never mind.

26:31.763 --> 26:33.496
So, clear the air after shift.

26:33.531 --> 26:35.831
- Or clear the air now.
- No.

26:35.867 --> 26:36.932
Frankel's right.

26:36.968 --> 26:38.334
Jack's in charge now,

26:38.369 --> 26:40.903
and I just need to be
the best lieutenant I can be.

26:40.938 --> 26:43.306
He's counting on that, you know?

26:43.341 --> 26:45.474
He's taking your rule-abiding,
good-soldier thing

26:45.510 --> 26:46.942
and using it against you.

26:46.978 --> 26:48.010
That's smart.

26:48.046 --> 26:49.679
That's the sign of a good competitor.

26:49.714 --> 26:52.481
Or it's just Jack trying
his best and me doing mine.

26:52.517 --> 26:54.291
- Doubt it.
- No.

26:55.486 --> 26:58.254
<i>Station 19, respond.</i>

26:58.289 --> 26:59.588
<i>Multiple victims.</i>

26:59.624 --> 27:03.993
<i>357 Fairmont Avenue.</i>

27:08.666 --> 27:09.999
Okay.

27:10.034 --> 27:12.101
It's a medical call, you know?

27:12.136 --> 27:14.003
Victims and people in peril.

27:14.038 --> 27:15.071
Yeah, I know.

27:15.106 --> 27:16.572
Yeah, well, 'cause you kind of seem like

27:16.607 --> 27:19.241
you're expecting a bounce house
and a backyard barbecue.

27:19.277 --> 27:20.676
No, no. See, no barbecue.

27:20.712 --> 27:22.678
No smoke, no fire, just a medical call.

27:22.714 --> 27:24.847
By-the-book medical call.
Why aren't you pumped?

27:24.882 --> 27:26.882
- You're the medicine man.
- You have to come help!

27:26.918 --> 27:28.851
I pulled them out of the pool and
I tried, but they won't wake up!

27:28.886 --> 27:30.486
They won't wake up!

27:31.522 --> 27:33.622
You have to wake them up!

27:40.571 --> 27:42.525
- Herrera, set up a triage over here.
- Will do.

27:42.550 --> 27:44.016
Everybody else, take a kid.

27:44.051 --> 27:47.190
Start resuscitating.
Warren, check the girl.

27:47.215 --> 27:49.315
See what you can find out...
drugs, alcohol...

27:49.351 --> 27:50.780
This is 19 to Dispatch,

27:50.815 --> 27:52.685
requesting additional units
and a hazmat team.

27:53.688 --> 27:54.887
Why is there fog in the pool?

27:54.923 --> 27:56.222
Why do these kids all look dead?

27:56.291 --> 27:58.124
That's my brother!
That's my baby brother!

27:58.159 --> 28:00.426
And the best way for us to help him
is to find out what happened here.

28:00.462 --> 28:02.128
Now, did you all take anything?
Drugs or...?

28:02.163 --> 28:03.830
Oh, God, no! Nothing like that.

28:03.865 --> 28:05.465
We were just making ice cream.

28:07.636 --> 28:10.036
Easy. Slow, deep breaths.

28:10.071 --> 28:11.638
We got one back.

28:11.673 --> 28:13.106
He's unresponsive to any stimuli.

28:13.141 --> 28:15.119
Airway's clear. I'm bagging him now.

28:15.154 --> 28:16.486
I'll start CPR.

28:16.522 --> 28:18.645
- Oh, God!
- I-I need you to be specific.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.446
Now, do you mean ice cream ice cream?

28:20.482 --> 28:22.115
And w-what's the gas over the pool?

28:22.150 --> 28:23.282
Is that liquid nitrogen?

28:23.318 --> 28:25.351
W-We used it to quick-freeze
the ice cream.

28:25.387 --> 28:26.786
And then we went swimming,

28:26.821 --> 28:28.121
and I poured the nitrogen in the pool.

28:28.156 --> 28:29.689
We thought it would look cool.

28:29.724 --> 28:31.758
It did, but one minute,
everyone was fine,

28:31.793 --> 28:33.726
and... and no one was talking or moving,

28:33.762 --> 28:34.961
just floating there.

28:34.996 --> 28:36.696
It must have displaced
the oxygen over the pool,

28:36.731 --> 28:38.264
which means they're all asphyxiated.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.433
That means everybody needs
supplemental O2, right now!

28:40.468 --> 28:43.046
As much as we've got.
Make sure those seals are tight!

28:43.081 --> 28:44.512
I pulled them out! I pulled them all out!

28:44.537 --> 28:45.609
And that was very brave.

28:45.645 --> 28:48.107
Got another one!

28:48.143 --> 28:49.642
Can you tell me your name? Where you are?

28:49.678 --> 28:51.077
Blake, I'm here. I'm here.

28:51.112 --> 28:53.746
I'm never letting you talk me
into anything, ever again.

28:53.782 --> 28:55.314
He seems alert and oriented.

28:55.350 --> 28:56.683
I got another one.

28:56.718 --> 28:58.512
Last kid's awake.

29:07.395 --> 29:08.928
Jack?

29:08.963 --> 29:10.633
- Jack!
- Why would he do that?

29:10.668 --> 29:13.066
Get Jack's O2 tank, right now!

29:13.101 --> 29:15.201
And the reaching tools! Jack!

29:15.236 --> 29:16.903
See anything? The fog's too heavy.

29:16.938 --> 29:18.438
Gibson! Gibson!

29:18.473 --> 29:19.639
Jack!

29:20.809 --> 29:22.141
Ugh! Jack?

29:22.177 --> 29:23.643
Come on.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.411
Gibson!

29:25.447 --> 29:28.181
Gibson!

29:30.652 --> 29:32.719
Travis, grab her by the head.

29:32.754 --> 29:33.720
Sydney!

29:33.755 --> 29:35.988
Get some O2 for Gibson right away!

29:36.024 --> 29:37.323
On three. One, two, three.

29:39.627 --> 29:41.327
I got her head.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.533
- No pulse.
- S-Sydney told me she was leaving.

29:47.569 --> 29:48.901
I-I thought she went home.

29:51.506 --> 29:54.107
Five, six, seven, eight.

29:55.350 --> 29:56.714
- Oh, there we go.
- It's okay.

29:56.749 --> 29:57.971
You're okay. We got you.

29:57.974 --> 29:59.112
- Bag.
- We got you.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.647
More warming blankets over here!

30:12.127 --> 30:14.660
You didn't have to take it
to such an extreme.

30:14.696 --> 30:17.630
Jumping into a pool of chemicals
just to crush me.

30:19.801 --> 30:21.868
I'm gonna go check on
the rest of those kids.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.572
I mean, how'd he know to jump in?

30:27.607 --> 30:29.809
None of us could even see into that pool.

30:29.844 --> 30:32.111
Nobody mentioned another kid missing.

30:32.147 --> 30:34.480
Well, he said he counted the flip-flops.

30:34.516 --> 30:36.182
Six pairs, only five kids.

30:36.217 --> 30:37.350
Wow.

30:37.385 --> 30:38.951
Yeah, he's always
a couple steps ahead that way.

30:38.987 --> 30:40.552
Rushes in like he doesn't have a plan,

30:40.588 --> 30:41.632
when the truth is,

30:41.667 --> 30:43.850
he's usually already
leapt ahead of the rest of us.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.391
Used to drive me nuts.

30:45.426 --> 30:46.759
I like to know the steps,

30:46.795 --> 30:49.862
but now I learned to just trust it.

30:51.032 --> 30:53.132
That's why he's ready for captain.

30:53.168 --> 30:54.801
And I'm not?

30:55.837 --> 30:57.737
Don't take this the wrong way,

30:57.772 --> 30:59.972
but it is a skill to do what he does,

31:00.008 --> 31:02.175
a skill that you haven't figured out yet.

31:02.210 --> 31:04.043
Jack's been a lieutenant for years.

31:04.078 --> 31:06.364
You've had less than two days.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.949
You're good, Herrera,
but you're still green.

31:11.519 --> 31:13.786
I lost a husband
under a captain that was green.

31:13.822 --> 31:15.857
I know the cost.

31:17.926 --> 31:20.359
You'll get there eventually,

31:20.395 --> 31:22.628
but you're not there yet.

31:30.831 --> 31:32.271
Patient status?

31:32.307 --> 31:34.807
The scene is secure.

31:34.843 --> 31:35.942
Patients are in good shape.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.543
We're getting contact info
for the parents

31:37.579 --> 31:38.878
so they can meet at the hospital.

31:38.913 --> 31:40.613
Dallas, you got those numbers?

31:40.648 --> 31:42.448
I-I can't quite catch my breath.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.883
Hang on. Hang on.

31:43.918 --> 31:45.318
Just go slowly, all right?

31:45.353 --> 31:46.752
Try to breathe, okay?

31:46.788 --> 31:48.254
I-I can't br... Deeper.

31:48.289 --> 31:49.288
I can't breathe.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.191
Okay, she's dry-drowning.

31:52.227 --> 31:54.560
Her airway's spasming, fluid's
building up in her lungs.

31:54.629 --> 31:56.095
Let's go! Her lungs are wet!

31:56.130 --> 31:57.563
I was just talking to her!

31:57.599 --> 31:59.599
It's a delayed response from
pulling people out of the pool.

31:59.634 --> 32:01.601
Got to get her to the hospital
right now, guys! Come on!

32:01.636 --> 32:03.436
Easy.

32:03.471 --> 32:04.637
I've got you.

32:07.610 --> 32:09.589
I've got you.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.058
Patient shows symptoms of dry-drowning.

32:14.093 --> 32:16.340
No LOC on scene, but she's in
respiratory distress,

32:16.365 --> 32:18.245
- like a pulmonary edema.
- Let's go.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.705
Delayed reaction... water was ingested
likely one, maybe two hours prior.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.340
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Stay calm, all right?

32:23.375 --> 32:24.911
We're getting some oxygen
in your lungs soon.

32:24.946 --> 32:26.743
Maybe I should go with her, just to
make sure BPs don't fall any further.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.812
- They've got it.
- Yeah, but I've been with her.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.414
And not to mention
I know everyone at Grey-Sloan.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.315
- I can make sure they...
- They'll know what to do, Warren.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.450
Regardless of who drops her off.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.589
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you worry.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.625
I know every single doctor there.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.260
And, uh, the residents will greet you

32:43.295 --> 32:45.729
and, uh, well, they're new,
but they're... they're smart.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.764
What day is today? Thursday.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.299
Dr. Kepner works trauma on Thursdays.

32:49.334 --> 32:50.834
You can't do any better than that.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.836
And the specialist they'll get for you,

32:52.871 --> 32:55.505
well, that'll probably be Dr. Bailey.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.608
She could knock you out
just with her smile.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.576
I promise.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.812
They've got you.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.313
Don't you worry.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.415
Not even for a second.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.783
Behind you.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.404
Montgomery thinks I'm too green
to make a good captain.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.005
- Please. What does he know?
- That is ridiculous.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.674
Experience isn't everything.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.210
Yeah, he's green. Like a-a booger.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.382
Jack did kick ass today.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.385
Well, I'm s...
Okay, we were all thinking it.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.221
So Jack's keeping pace.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.589
- So what?
- That's not what I'm worried about.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.957
It's no big deal.

33:46.992 --> 33:49.734
Consider it inspiration to
hit the track harder tomorrow.

33:49.769 --> 33:52.496
- Yeah, no, I-I got it.
- Stay focused, stay ready...

33:52.531 --> 33:53.697
I said I've got it!

33:53.732 --> 33:56.132
You don't have to coach me, okay?

33:56.168 --> 33:58.268
Um, this is my race, not yours.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.537
Wow. Okay.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.138
Just... I got it.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.516
I can handle things
with Jack myself, okay?

34:04.552 --> 34:07.077
Sure. Yeah. Go for it.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.650
Jack did kick ass today.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.429
The incident report for the pool.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.998
No problems between you
and Herrera this time?

34:29.034 --> 34:30.300
Like on the roof?

34:31.469 --> 34:33.703
I stand behind my call up there.

34:35.514 --> 34:37.806
But I know I could've
handled myself differently.

34:37.842 --> 34:42.022
If my conduct up there takes me
out of the running, well...

34:42.714 --> 34:44.514
I'll respect that.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.018
You'd be amazed by the number
of lieutenants I served with

34:48.053 --> 34:49.819
who couldn't admit a mistake.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.755
You know, when I started out,

34:51.790 --> 34:53.523
I dealt with a lot.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.891
No women's bathrooms.

34:54.927 --> 34:58.061
At one station, my locker
was the trunk of my car.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.431
And pranks... stupid, endless pranks.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.066
You don't know how many times

35:03.101 --> 35:04.834
I stood in front of my captain's office

35:04.870 --> 35:08.405
ready to file complaints,
or quit, but I didn't.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.973
And when I finally made captain,

35:10.008 --> 35:11.741
do you know what
those same firefighters did?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.176
What?

35:13.211 --> 35:16.880
They followed my orders because
I'd earned their respect.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.482
I fought my way up
every rung of the ladder,

35:19.518 --> 35:20.784
and they knew it.

35:20.819 --> 35:24.487
And I didn't have anything
handed to me by my daddy.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.389
And neither did you.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.624
And I respect that.

35:36.564 --> 35:38.201
Permission to speak frankly?

35:38.237 --> 35:40.604
Granted.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.039
Andy <i> has</i> earned her spot here.

35:43.075 --> 35:46.109
I mean, she should've
made lead lieutenant years ago.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.032
Y-You think Pruitt gave her a leg up?

35:48.068 --> 35:49.679
He held her back,

35:49.715 --> 35:52.682
because it made his life easier
to have his daughter around.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.885
This place ran so smoothly on his command

35:55.921 --> 35:58.021
because of Andy Herrera.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.556
Loyalty's good, Gibson.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.810
It is, but you should stop
while you're ahead.

36:19.205 --> 36:21.603
You look like you need to talk.

36:25.942 --> 36:28.543
I'll listen, but I am...

36:28.578 --> 36:30.011
very tired,

36:30.047 --> 36:32.614
so don't get offended if I fall asleep.

36:34.251 --> 36:37.952
Oh, there's... there's no follow-up.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.555
We see a patient, we treat them,

36:40.590 --> 36:41.856
throw them in an ambulance...

36:41.892 --> 36:45.093
We never see them again.

36:45.128 --> 36:47.162
We never see how it ends.

36:47.197 --> 36:49.354
It's better that way. Trust me.

36:49.390 --> 36:50.765
Oh.

36:50.801 --> 36:52.233
Look, I know what you're gonna tell me.

36:52.269 --> 36:54.235
Dial it back, get some distance,

36:54.271 --> 36:55.670
don't let so much in.

36:55.706 --> 36:57.239
And I'm... I'm trying,

36:57.264 --> 37:00.842
but, man, this job...

37:00.877 --> 37:03.278
hits you sometimes.

37:03.313 --> 37:06.249
And when you least expect it, you know?

37:07.840 --> 37:09.173
Nope.

37:09.198 --> 37:10.331
I do not know.

37:10.356 --> 37:13.190
Because, unlike you,
I don't have a soft underbelly.

37:13.215 --> 37:15.014
It's a crunchy candy shell.

37:15.039 --> 37:16.972
Can't crack this.

37:20.163 --> 37:23.865
<i>I know the name makes it sound</i>
<i>like we're</i> fighting <i> fires...</i>

37:23.900 --> 37:26.067
<i>but that's not it.</i>

37:26.103 --> 37:29.137
<i>Really, we're</i> conquering <i> them.</i>

37:32.609 --> 37:34.175
JJ.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.144
What happened?

37:36.179 --> 37:38.913
Are you okay?

37:43.787 --> 37:45.954
Seth died.

37:52.996 --> 37:54.829
You didn't agree to promote me

37:54.865 --> 37:56.464
just because I'm your daughter, right?

37:56.500 --> 37:57.866
You knew I could do this job.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.601
Of course.

38:00.804 --> 38:02.804
Did something happen?

38:02.839 --> 38:05.340
I was just...

38:10.113 --> 38:12.680
It is so hard

38:12.716 --> 38:16.418
to just sit back and not get involved.

38:16.453 --> 38:19.512
To just let things happen.

38:20.791 --> 38:22.424
I know.

38:22.459 --> 38:23.892
I know you know.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.928
<i>But you can't conquer
what you can't control.</i>

38:28.398 --> 38:30.398
This one again.

38:30.434 --> 38:33.034
Andy, do you have a minute?

38:38.375 --> 38:41.876
Smoke inhalation can
catch you by surprise sometimes.

38:41.912 --> 38:44.145
I don't even know why I came here.

38:45.338 --> 38:49.384
It's just, weirdly, the one person
Seth and I had in common was...

38:49.419 --> 38:50.685
you.

38:52.489 --> 38:55.890
I'm alive and Seth's dead.

38:55.926 --> 38:58.426
How does that happen?

38:58.462 --> 38:59.861
<i>Why</i> does that happen?

39:01.364 --> 39:03.097
I wish I knew.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.133
How do you do it?

39:05.168 --> 39:06.734
Every day...

39:06.770 --> 39:08.570
how do you deal with stuff like this?

39:08.605 --> 39:11.573
I, um...

39:11.608 --> 39:14.008
I shut it off.

39:14.044 --> 39:17.612
Put those feelings on a shelf...

39:17.647 --> 39:20.048
and lock them away.

39:20.884 --> 39:22.650
Does that work?

39:24.287 --> 39:26.221
Not today.

39:26.256 --> 39:28.890
<i>So, we use tricks and tools.</i>

39:28.925 --> 39:30.925
I, um...

39:30.961 --> 39:33.361
I guess I should go.

39:39.603 --> 39:43.471
<i>We talk ourselves into
believing, "We've got this."</i>

39:46.443 --> 39:48.114
Your dad said this thing to me

39:48.114 --> 39:49.581
and I wanted to talk
to you about it the other day,

39:49.616 --> 39:50.882
but your friends were there.

39:50.917 --> 39:52.450
So, then I was just gonna let it
go, but I don't think I can.

39:52.485 --> 39:53.651
Okay.

39:53.687 --> 39:55.620
Do you know your dad is still mad

39:55.655 --> 39:57.355
about the time we hot-wired his car?

39:57.390 --> 40:00.425
Yeah, but... that's bugging you?

40:00.460 --> 40:02.727
Your dad still sees me
as some screwed-up kid,

40:02.762 --> 40:03.795
and that's fine.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.332
But I want to make sure <i>his</i> opinions

40:07.367 --> 40:09.100
aren't also <i>your</i> opinions.

40:09.135 --> 40:10.735
Meaning...?

40:10.770 --> 40:13.972
I don't want you to think of me
like a kid, because...

40:14.007 --> 40:15.106
I'm not.

40:15.141 --> 40:16.107
I-I know that.

40:16.142 --> 40:17.895
And we've kind of been acting like kids.

40:17.930 --> 40:20.144
You said we were all good.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.312
I know.

40:21.348 --> 40:23.481
Are you saying we're <i> not</i> all good?

40:23.516 --> 40:24.949
No. We are.

40:24.985 --> 40:26.818
I think. Are we?

40:26.853 --> 40:28.987
Yes.

40:29.022 --> 40:31.856
Look, I just wanted to say

40:31.891 --> 40:33.689
I'm not the kid next door anymore.

40:34.873 --> 40:38.029
I've... gone through stuff.

40:38.064 --> 40:40.632
I've grown up.

40:41.801 --> 40:43.268
<i>That fire isn't bigger than us.</i>

40:44.804 --> 40:46.804
So have I.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.640
<i>We know what to do.</i>

40:48.675 --> 40:51.042
Anyway, I couldn't sleep

40:51.077 --> 40:53.144
without getting that off my chest, so...

40:53.179 --> 40:55.046
<i>Contain the flame and control it,</i>

40:55.081 --> 40:56.414
<i>because if we don't...</i>

40:56.449 --> 40:58.916
Uh, what... what if I won't
be able to sleep tonight?

41:00.954 --> 41:03.321
Can't help you there.

41:03.356 --> 41:05.623
<i>...that fire will just spread...</i>

41:05.659 --> 41:07.125
Night.

41:18.538 --> 41:20.471
<i>...all over the damn place.</i>
