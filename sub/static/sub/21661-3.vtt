01:08.401 --> 01:09.819
Hi.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.576
I'm in here.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.877
I said I was in there.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.408
Don't tell anyone

01:58.409 --> 01:59.702
what you just saw.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.624
I'm only telling you,

02:05.625 --> 02:06.960
but the truth is,

02:08.044 --> 02:09.254
I'm terminally ill.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.592
I look too healthy
for it to be true, right?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.763
Sure, I can't believe it either.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.351
Anyway, don't tell the others, okay?

02:24.269 --> 02:26.688
But, why are you telling me?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.106
The truth is,

02:29.941 --> 02:32.694
it's too much to endure by myself.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.738
I need to tell someone,

02:36.364 --> 02:38.825
but I can't tell people
who are too close to me.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.370
Because that person will be
in just as much pain as I am.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.165
It may hurt your feelings if I say this,

02:46.416 --> 02:49.919
but you and I are not that close yet.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.550
-Is it true?
-It's a lie.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.515
Eun-jae, are you almost ready?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.184
Give me a minute.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.693
-Isn't she going to school?
-She is.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.029
-What about Jin...
-Jin-myung?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.281
Yes. What about her?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.366
She left for work already.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.485
EPISODE 3
DECIDE TO HATE #CrimeandPunishment

03:55.568 --> 03:58.780
IS THE SEMESTER REALLY STARTING?

04:00.281 --> 04:01.574
"Really starting?"

04:02.075 --> 04:03.159
Of course, it is.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.911
But I'm taking the semester off.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.706
The library. I'm going to the library.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.084
Are you going to the lecture hall?
The lecture hall?

04:12.710 --> 04:14.963
Be strong, superpower

04:15.546 --> 04:17.048
Be strong.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.301
You can do it!

04:36.567 --> 04:37.694
Ye-eun!

04:38.236 --> 04:41.614
It really is you! Are you back?

04:42.198 --> 04:44.450
-Yes.
-You didn't say you were taking a break.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.369
You need a beating.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.454
Hey.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.873
Hey. I was just kidding.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.209
You seem different, by the way.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.336
Hey.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.214
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.924
-Are you late for class?
-Yes.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.384
Let's go. Later.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.510
Bye.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.097
-Did you come alone?
-No. My housemates...

05:06.180 --> 05:09.475
Ye-eun has changed. She seems gloomy.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.479
-You must really not know.
-What?

05:21.070 --> 05:24.115
Ye-eun is getting psychiatric treatment.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.745
It's okay.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.165
Nothing will happen.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.800
It's okay.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.969
It's okay.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.560
It's nothing.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.854
Hello.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.564
Hi.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.372
Hey.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.965
Hi.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.551
Hello.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.350
-How have you been?
-Well.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.019
-You look so tanned.
-I got so dark.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.813
-Look.
-Hi.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.397
-Hi there.
-Hi.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.899
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.484
It's been a while.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.115
Why aren't you sitting together?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.617
You've dated for over a year.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.287
They look like
they haven't even held hands.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.208
But then again, Eun-jae is very shy.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.508
Eun-jae.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.428
What? Did I do something wrong?

07:09.512 --> 07:11.431
-Seriously.
-So annoying.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.724
What? Is that sexual harassment too?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.226
-Seriously.
-Seriously.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.562
They broke up.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.647
When? Why?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.109
Jong-yeoul. Is that true?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.868
Forget it. It's not a big deal.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.079
People break up even after having kids.
You were only dating.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.206
Do you have to marry everyone you date?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.250
Then everyone would've married
their first love.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.586
You sound like you've dated a lot before.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.338
That's something you just know.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.675
Do you have to date and break up
to know what it feels like?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.765
Don't worry. It'll all pass.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.102
You think everyone's looking at you
and talking about you, right?

07:58.728 --> 08:00.980
They're not.
They're not interested in your life.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.815
You're the only one
interested in your life.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.526
-I know that, but...
-But what?

08:05.610 --> 08:08.446
It passes. We know it does.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.657
But it's the brief moment
before it passes that's hard.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.454
If you were so worried,
why did you date openly?

08:16.537 --> 08:18.247
We didn't.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.666
We got caught.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.168
So why did you get caught?

08:22.251 --> 08:25.796
You sound like an old man. You must not
know because you've never dated,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.300
but you think you can hide your feelings
when you like someone? You can't.

08:29.383 --> 08:33.304
Stupid relationships.
What's so great about hormones going wild?

08:33.804 --> 08:35.973
You're the one obsessed with guys.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.101
Look here, old lady.
Let's make things clear.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.230
What I want is not a relationship.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.023
What I'm desperate for...

08:44.106 --> 08:44.982
-Don't.
-Stop.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.359
It's sex!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.190
It's good to see you.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.986
Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.612
-Why are you so late?
-Finally.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.281
Sorry.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.284
-How do you keep getting prettier?
-Come on.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.288
-What took you so long?
-I was busy.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.208
Is this it?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.793
COLLEGE JOURNALISM AWARD OF THIS YEAR

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
Was there prize money?
How much do they give now?

09:48.546 --> 09:49.714
About two million won.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.216
Hey. You guys buy the drinks.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.886
Obviously, it's all gone by now.
You know that.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.388
You punks.

09:57.471 --> 10:01.267
Hey. You don't think of older alumni
when you have money, do you?

10:01.517 --> 10:02.643
Love flows...

10:02.727 --> 10:03.686
-down!
-Down!

10:03.769 --> 10:06.147
-Drink.
-Good job.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.982
Hi!

10:10.776 --> 10:11.777
This is nice.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.280
You never change.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.160
Thank you.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.787
I need to let it out like this
or I'll get stiff.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.332
Are you still the same?

10:26.500 --> 10:27.752
What?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.631
Nothing. It's nothing.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.758
I'm still a virgin.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.928
No way.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.223
Right? Isn't that weird?
You can't understand, right?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.142
But it's true.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.771
For me, popping my cherry is more urgent
than getting a job.

10:46.854 --> 10:50.107
The day I pop my cherry,
I'll put out an ad in the paper.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.943
"Ji-won Song Finally Became a Woman."

10:53.653 --> 10:55.655
Hey.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.115
Stop saying that everywhere. Be quiet.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.700
-Why can't I talk?
-Hey.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.952
Stop it. You guys still fight?

11:02.536 --> 11:04.580
Sung-min is going to grad school, so okay.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.208
What about you guys?
Are you looking for jobs?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.877
I have this. What's the worry?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.172
Who doesn't have one of these now?
Everyone has one.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.924
-Really?
-That's right.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.468
That's right.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.640
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.661
The men's room is that way.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.246
Hey.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.001
-Is it true?
-What?

11:51.460 --> 11:54.672
That you're more desperate
to sleep with a guy than to get a job.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.384
If it is,

11:59.552 --> 12:00.636
want to go?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.431
-Where?
-To do it.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.105
I like you. Let's go.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.203
Let's go.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.249
Ji-won!

13:13.626 --> 13:15.503
Ji-won, what's wrong?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.546
Wake up. Please call an ambulance.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.381
Wake up.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.050
Are you okay?

13:21.634 --> 13:22.801
Oh, no.

13:22.885 --> 13:23.928
Ji-won!

13:26.430 --> 13:27.473
Ji-won!

13:28.307 --> 13:29.934
-Ji-won!
-Wake up!

13:31.936 --> 13:34.313
Ji-won, are you okay?

13:34.396 --> 13:36.732
Ji-won. Ji-won Song!

13:37.191 --> 13:40.069
Ji-won. Snap out of it.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.530
Ji-won.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.823
Are you okay?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.325
Pretty shoes.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.161
What?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.208
What?

13:54.416 --> 13:55.543
Are you okay?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.086
Are you awake?

14:05.803 --> 14:07.555
So? Who do you think it is?

14:09.098 --> 14:11.642
The recipient of the letter.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.852
You said there were four?

14:15.729 --> 14:17.648
The person you just want to pick on.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.611
-The seat's empty. Sit.
-It's okay.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.655
-Why? You're tired.
-I'm fine.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.657
But there's a seat.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.492
Excuse me.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.161
Yes?

14:31.245 --> 14:35.332
Another seat is open. Do you mind sitting
there so that my boyfriend can sit here?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.795
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.423
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.561
The pink hamster who's a different person
at home versus outside.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.133
The one who talks a lot
and lies on top of that.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.887
That's where my memory ends.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.057
"Want to go?" I can't remember the rest.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.476
That freak.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.313
So? Were you really going to go with him?

15:39.563 --> 15:43.025
-Yes, I think so.
-Really? To do it?

15:44.944 --> 15:49.114
Hey! What do you even know about him?
You don't know him that well.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.825
I can get to know him afterward.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.328
You're just as bad.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.829
What?

15:55.913 --> 15:59.208
When a guy says he's a virgin,
people say he needs to do it.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.502
Why is a girl different?
Are you being sexist?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.712
Don't talk nonsense.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.757
I'm speechless. What? Sexist?

16:07.591 --> 16:10.344
You punk. What were you doing
during sex education?

16:10.427 --> 16:13.347
For both guys and girls,
your body is precious.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.474
The first time is especially precious.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.102
Whatever. You save it, you lose it.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.897
Are you...

16:22.731 --> 16:23.732
What?

16:25.693 --> 16:27.945
Don't tell me you're a virgin too.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.369
Hey. Go. Just go.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.996
You little punk.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.374
No wonder. I always thought
there was something strange about you.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.459
-I'm not...
-It's okay.

16:42.543 --> 16:46.088
Accept reality.
It must've been hard for you.

16:46.630 --> 16:47.798
Just go.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.883
Bye.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.808
Hey, Sung-min! Chin up!

16:57.891 --> 16:59.601
I'll keep your secret!

16:59.977 --> 17:03.355
I won't tell anyone you're still a virgin!

17:03.439 --> 17:04.690
Get over here.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.068
Why you...

17:11.697 --> 17:14.408
Who else was there?
You said there were four.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.328
The one you want to pick on.
The pink hamster.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.040
The liar.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.584
-The show off.
-That's right.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.930
Is that fun?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.371
How annoying.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.291
I hate people who read books
on the subway.

18:04.708 --> 18:08.629
When I'm playing a game,
they take out a book as if to show me.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.589
They're annoying.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.883
I don't mind her reading books,

18:13.300 --> 18:15.219
but she makes me feel inferior.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.555
It isn't just me, though.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.144
Oh, no! The donut!

18:28.440 --> 18:29.900
I got it.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.203
Hi, Jin-myung. You're home late.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.831
I should go study.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.499
Me too.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.638
So? Does she work?

19:00.013 --> 19:02.224
-She just got a job.
-Where?

19:03.684 --> 19:04.893
She said the name...

19:05.853 --> 19:08.272
I forgot. I don't think
it's anywhere famous.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.690
Why? Aren't they all from Yonsei?

19:09.773 --> 19:12.276
Yes, but probably because she's old.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.613
-They know what school you go to?
-Yes.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.658
You must've felt inferior.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.702
What's wrong with our school?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.787
It's not as good as theirs.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.207
-You got some on you.
-Wipe it for me.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.795
Thank you.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.923
Stupid.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.325
It's quiet. Are the others not back yet?

20:02.284 --> 20:03.202
They are.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.634
Jin-myung, aren't you going to wash up?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.805
I will. I should.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.146
What's the big deal?

20:33.523 --> 20:35.025
I fainted today.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.904
Sure. That's normal for someone
who's terminally ill.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.449
But, I really did...

21:37.254 --> 21:40.465
Hello. I'm Jin-myung Yoon
from Management Support team.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.636
Please sign here.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.310

21:58.942 --> 22:02.029
MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TEAM
JIN-MYUNG YOON

22:07.868 --> 22:08.952
Thank you.

22:52.079 --> 22:52.954
What are you doing?

22:53.997 --> 22:55.999
Nothing. Don't mind me.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.437
Okay, fine. What? What is it this time?

23:18.438 --> 23:19.689
You want to know that badly?

23:26.113 --> 23:27.614
I went to the hospital today.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.912
And? What did the doctor say?
Are you dying?

24:09.239 --> 24:11.867
What is it? What did the doctor say?

24:15.203 --> 24:16.329
That...

24:27.549 --> 24:29.050
That there's nothing wrong with me.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.557
It's weird.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.601
How is there nothing wrong with me?

24:37.684 --> 24:40.437
I should at least have
an iron deficiency or something.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.565
I fainted. How could there be
nothing wrong with me?

24:44.649 --> 24:46.651
That's a big problem.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.323
-You drank that night.
-Just two bottles of beer.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.533
I'm Ji-won Song.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.912
I'm Sung-min Lim.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.624
-Sung-min.
-Let go.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.628
Maybe something is
seriously wrong with me.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.342
Did you just realize that?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.386
Something is wrong with you. Very wrong.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.307
Not with my body,

25:18.391 --> 25:19.643
but maybe with my mind.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.067
I saw something weird when I fainted.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.405
Ji-won! Wake up. Ji-won.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.993
Hide well so I don't see you

25:37.118 --> 25:40.413
Hide well so I don't see you

25:40.956 --> 25:44.042
Hide well so I don't see you

25:44.417 --> 25:47.379
Hide well so I don't see you

25:50.548 --> 25:51.758
Pretty shoes.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.428
"Pretty shoes"?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.557
Yes. "Pretty shoes."

26:08.149 --> 26:09.901
-I'm starved.
-Me too.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.279
-Where are we going?
-I'll buy the coffee. You buy drinks.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.782
You jerk!

26:23.498 --> 26:24.874
She's Ji-won Song.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.880
Sung-min.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.341
Yes? What?

26:34.426 --> 26:35.719
Are you okay?

26:35.969 --> 26:36.803
Yes.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.228
How much of it is true?

27:06.541 --> 27:07.375
Sorry.

27:08.752 --> 27:09.586
Sure.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.553
He said, "Sorry."

27:19.971 --> 27:22.390
-You must've been upset.
-I know.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.023
He used to touch me
like it was his own body.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.941
Now, he apologizes for a little touch.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.236
How far did you guys...

27:38.281 --> 27:42.410
What will you do now?
You'll have to see him until you graduate.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.787
You can't take time off.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.873
-Send him to the army.
-He already went.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.375
I wish he could go again.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.754
I'm cold. Why am I suddenly
getting the chills?

27:54.255 --> 27:56.716
-Switch. It's hot here.
-Okay.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.225
This is better.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.984
You're drinking too much lately.

28:17.779 --> 28:21.449
But then again, you're using alcohol
to soothe the pain in your heart.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.327
Why did you guys break up, anyway?

28:24.411 --> 28:25.412
Why did you break up?

28:27.414 --> 28:28.456
I just...

28:28.957 --> 28:31.876
There seem to be
a lot of messy breakups lately,

28:32.001 --> 28:33.670
let alone the dating abuses.

28:37.465 --> 28:40.969
It's nothing like that.
We just broke up. Right?

28:41.052 --> 28:42.762
Yes, they just broke up.

28:43.346 --> 28:46.141
It's not like either of them
cheated, or scammed,

28:46.224 --> 28:47.517
or hit the other person.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.940
Who breaks up without a reason?

28:54.899 --> 28:56.526
There was a reason.

28:57.694 --> 28:58.862
Love faded.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.115
That's the saddest reason.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.743
So? Why did you break up?

29:05.869 --> 29:07.370
Were you dumped?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.622
Were you dumped?

29:10.248 --> 29:11.750
No. I dumped him.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.878
Right? I dumped him, right?

29:14.961 --> 29:17.380
Yes, she dumped him.
She's the one who dumped him.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.717
She looks like she was dumped.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.471
I asked to break up first!

29:24.554 --> 29:26.389
Yes, you did. Calm down.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.601
That punk wouldn't call,

29:30.101 --> 29:31.936
took forever to respond to texts,

29:32.020 --> 29:34.481
showed up late for dates,
and what else was there?

29:34.564 --> 29:38.193
He seemed bored when we were together,
and didn't want to take me home.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.070
He would always check his phone.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.656
He would yawn while I was talking.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.826
A rolled egg omelet, please.

29:46.993 --> 29:47.827
Okay.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.039
When he forgot our anniversary...

29:51.623 --> 29:54.417
It was our 333rd day together.
It was 333 days.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.171
That day would never come again.
But, he had no idea.

29:58.671 --> 30:00.882
He didn't ask me to go out
during the summer.

30:01.466 --> 30:05.804
In the past, he would make up stories,
just to go out with me.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.142
That jerk.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.938
Simply put, those were the reasons.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.941
That's why I told him
I wanted to break up.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.609
Sounds like you were dumped.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.153
He may not have said it,
but he dumped you.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.241
I dumped him! I did! I'm the one
who said to break up, so I dumped him.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.867
You're so dense.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.581
Zilong.

30:34.457 --> 30:37.001
You have set fire
to the wrath of the king.

30:37.585 --> 30:38.628
What?

30:39.212 --> 30:41.840
It's her first relationship
and her first breakup,

30:41.923 --> 30:44.342
so she's very sensitive
about those details.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.387
You sound like you've had
numerous relationships.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.105
What?

30:57.689 --> 31:00.358
How did she know my nickname was Zilong?

31:00.441 --> 31:03.319
It is? It's really Zilong? Why?

31:04.863 --> 31:05.697
Let's go.

31:05.780 --> 31:09.367
-How much?
-About 17,000 won each should do.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.451
Okay.

31:11.619 --> 31:13.705
-Here.
-Okay.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.498
I'll give you 20,000 won.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.125
Here's 3,000 won in change.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.751
-Thanks.
-Put that away.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.921
Here's the bill.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.132
So? Why did you break up?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.677
Was I supposed to date only her forever?

31:29.721 --> 31:30.889
True.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.226
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.522
Submit your team's ideas
for the assessment

32:21.606 --> 32:24.651
to the office by 6:00 p.m. this Friday.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.112
As usual, the groups were made
by your names in alphabetical order.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.531
So please check the handout.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.202
That's all for today.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.504
LIST OF TEAMS

32:49.968 --> 32:52.845
TEAM E
EUN-JAE YOO, JONG-YEOUL YOON

32:58.142 --> 32:59.143
What?

33:01.646 --> 33:02.855
Nothing.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.785
-Hello.
-Hello.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.329
Hi. I see you often.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.539
-Yes.
-Yes.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.551
Who will prepare the presentation file?

33:31.634 --> 33:34.262
The first person on the list
usually does it.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.805
-Then Se-hyun?
-Sure.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.432
-Let's just...
-Hey.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.058
Hi.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.523
He switched with Jong-yeoul.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.817
Let's do our best.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.668
Jerk. Like I wanted to be on his team?

34:05.752 --> 34:07.045
I hated it too!

34:07.128 --> 34:09.172
But I didn't want to make things awkward.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.966
Then why did he say he liked me?
He said he liked me first.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.551
He said he would love me forever!

34:22.101 --> 34:24.353
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.370
3 MISSED CALLS
SOO-JUNG LEE

34:47.210 --> 34:50.630
-Ye-eun! Over here!
-Hey! Ye-eun!

34:57.720 --> 34:58.721
Hi.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.641
It's been so long.
How many years has it been?

35:01.849 --> 35:04.435
-Four years? Five?
-Has it?

35:05.144 --> 35:07.146
You lost so much weight.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.148
You were like this in high school.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.608
Was I?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.070
Are you ready to order?

35:14.570 --> 35:15.947
Orange juice, please.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.540
But why did you suddenly want to meet?

35:26.124 --> 35:29.919
Hey. Do friends need a reason to meet?

35:30.419 --> 35:33.214
No, that's not what I meant.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.843
I saw Seo-young recently. Seo-young Kim.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.806
I haven't seen her in a while either.
How is she doing?

35:42.431 --> 35:44.767
She's studying
for the teacher certification exam.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.979
That's good for her.
I should've gone into education.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.690
You couldn't go
because your grades were too low.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.400
You sound like you had a choice.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.831
I heard you took time off.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.045
Thank you.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.966
Seo-young told me what happened.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.053
I see.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.099
I heard you were attacked
by your boyfriend.

36:29.687 --> 36:30.563
Yes.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.191
How did that happen?

36:36.485 --> 36:37.778
Just...

36:38.529 --> 36:41.741
How did someone as smart as you
date someone like that?

36:41.866 --> 36:44.368
I'm sure he wasn't weird from the start.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.872
I hear guys like that
are super nice at first.

36:53.669 --> 36:54.795
I would

36:55.630 --> 36:58.549
rather not talk about it.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.718
No, that's not good.

37:00.801 --> 37:05.264
You have to talk about it,
to avoid it developing into PTSD.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.771
I heard you were abducted too.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.983
You are really incredible,

37:16.067 --> 37:18.361
going to school after what happened.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.905
I could never.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.573
I would lock myself in my room.

37:22.907 --> 37:23.866
You poor thing.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.410
Why did you date a weirdo?

37:26.494 --> 37:28.412
I'm sure it was all your fault.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.623
It could've been your fault.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.418
The guy could've been the problem,
but you probably asked for it.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.170
You poor thing.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.428
What happened before that happened?

37:46.055 --> 37:49.308
-What?
-He couldn't have suddenly changed.

37:49.934 --> 37:50.977
Well...

37:52.561 --> 37:54.897
I said I wanted to break up.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.818
See? There must have been a reason.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.207
What?

38:14.583 --> 38:16.377
The thing is...

38:16.752 --> 38:18.379
Do you know him?

38:20.339 --> 38:21.424
What is it?

38:22.174 --> 38:23.592
Excuse me!

38:25.553 --> 38:26.679
Wait!

38:30.850 --> 38:32.184
What are you doing?

38:32.268 --> 38:33.853
Let go.

38:52.913 --> 38:55.374
Excuse me. What are you doing?

38:55.458 --> 38:56.959
What are you doing?

38:59.628 --> 39:01.339
-What are you doing?
-Tell us.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.215
Wait. Don't go.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.100
SOO-JUNG LEE

39:22.943 --> 39:26.155
I was taking a bath,
and the tub was made of glass.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.615
Everything was glass.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.910
That must've been nice.
You like being all naked.

39:30.993 --> 39:33.829
What's good about my being naked?
Other people should be naked.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.041
What could that dream mean?

39:37.541 --> 39:40.127
-Can you interpret dreams?
-No clue.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.254
You useless punk.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.424
So I've been thinking.

39:45.841 --> 39:49.303
The nightmares started
after that night I fainted.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.139
What do I need to focus on?

39:53.265 --> 39:54.850
Why you fainted?

39:54.934 --> 39:57.228
Exactly. Why did I faint?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.648
What happened right before I fainted?

40:01.315 --> 40:03.359
What happened before I fainted?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.861
You were about to get your wish.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.824
Exactly. My Sung-min is so smart.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.200
Stop it.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.702
It was the moment you've been waiting for.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.455
But you fainted. Why?

40:16.831 --> 40:17.998
You were overjoyed.

40:18.791 --> 40:23.587
Seriously. That's your limit.
You see only what you see.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.508
Maybe I'm afraid of sex.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.302
You?

40:31.137 --> 40:34.640
Just say... What was that...

40:34.723 --> 40:36.892
A dog is afraid of its crap?

40:36.976 --> 40:40.020
That's it. All you ever talk about is sex.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.732
I guess so. I'm a bit over-the-top.

40:43.816 --> 40:44.984
At least you know that.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.777
You know.

40:47.069 --> 40:50.948
Kids who undergo major surgery
like to play doctor.

40:51.323 --> 40:54.201
But they play the doctor.

40:55.119 --> 40:59.290
I may be so obsessed with sex
because I'm actually afraid.

41:00.749 --> 41:04.128
If I really wanted to do it,
I should've been able to by now.

41:04.211 --> 41:06.922
I'm sexy, classy,

41:07.006 --> 41:09.008
and intellectual.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.093
Plus, I'm really into it. Right?

41:12.511 --> 41:15.473
Do you remember anything else
after you fainted?

41:15.639 --> 41:16.640
No.

41:17.224 --> 41:20.978
That's why I watch porn
when I have a chance to.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.189
What?

41:23.647 --> 41:25.983
In case it'll trigger a memory.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.651
And?

41:28.736 --> 41:29.820
Nothing.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.448
-You didn't feel anything?
-No.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.952
Of course, I got excited. I did, but...

41:37.036 --> 41:38.245
Whatever.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.998
Is it because it's in 2D?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.209
What?

41:48.547 --> 41:50.466
What? What are you doing?

41:52.176 --> 41:53.344
What?

41:54.094 --> 41:55.763
Work with me here.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.140
What...

42:00.559 --> 42:01.519
The sense of reality.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.982
Hey! No.

42:07.066 --> 42:10.027
It's okay. It'll be over soon.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.287
Hello.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.500
I'm sorry.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.294
I'm sorry.

42:39.431 --> 42:42.393
Why didn't I feel anything?
Is it because of you?

42:43.018 --> 42:44.019
Me? Why?

42:44.687 --> 42:46.272
Should we have done more?

42:46.647 --> 42:48.524
Do what? Seat belt.

42:49.024 --> 42:50.776
Yes, sir.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.572
How about we take a trip
before your brother gets back?

42:54.655 --> 42:57.533
Go by yourself. Yongsan Station, right?

42:57.616 --> 43:00.035
-Gwangcheon would be better.
-Shut up.

43:43.829 --> 43:46.874
I'm not a strange man.
It's an emergency, that's why.

43:57.217 --> 43:59.637
-What are you doing?
-Working late.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.264
Then why the smiley face?

44:02.348 --> 44:04.600
I've always wanted to say that.

44:04.683 --> 44:05.684
Excuse me.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.481
Sorry, but don't talk about me.

44:12.149 --> 44:16.737
Celebrities have personal lives too.
Shouldn't you leave us alone while we eat?

44:17.571 --> 44:18.947
Who are you?

44:23.619 --> 44:25.412
Then why did you smile at me?

44:27.247 --> 44:31.460
I just smiled. I don't know who you are,
and I didn't talk about you.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.214
Then let me see.

44:35.839 --> 44:36.882
Why?

44:36.965 --> 44:38.884
To see whether or not you talked about me.

44:38.967 --> 44:40.219
Are you insane?

44:41.762 --> 44:44.556
Fine. I didn't mean to upset you.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.975
It's just that we have private lives too.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.769
Sorry.

44:50.145 --> 44:53.273
You didn't take my picture, did you?

44:56.527 --> 44:57.569
I trust you.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.364
Sorry.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.585
It's 1,800 won.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.182
Ji-won!

45:28.517 --> 45:31.103
-Here!
-Mom!

45:35.274 --> 45:36.733
You still don't have a job?

45:37.234 --> 45:39.027
-Mom.
-What?

45:39.403 --> 45:41.697
Don't you know the three questions
you must never ask?

45:41.864 --> 45:44.867
When you're getting a job,
getting married, or having a baby.

45:44.950 --> 45:45.993
Whatever.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.871
Then what should I ask? About the weather?

45:51.582 --> 45:52.583
Why did you come?

45:54.084 --> 45:55.878
Because I missed you.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.507
Look straight ahead. You're driving.

46:02.050 --> 46:04.720
Don't waste your time, and study.

46:04.803 --> 46:06.430
Study, then get a job.

46:06.513 --> 46:07.931
Yes, ma'am.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.106
-Mom.
-Yes?

46:20.861 --> 46:23.739
Mom, when I was little,

46:24.156 --> 46:26.992
did something traumatic happen to me?

46:27.075 --> 46:28.827
-Yes.
-What?

46:28.911 --> 46:31.955
It wasn't once or twice. You troublemaker.

46:32.039 --> 46:35.292
You tripped, fell, busted things...

46:35.375 --> 46:38.712
-Not things like that.
-Then what?

46:40.047 --> 46:41.298
Well...

46:42.966 --> 46:43.967
What's Dad doing?

46:44.051 --> 46:46.011
Ji-won!

46:47.095 --> 46:48.222
Welcome home!

46:56.855 --> 46:59.775
-Dad!
-You're home!

47:00.192 --> 47:01.568
Why are you out in the heat?

47:01.652 --> 47:04.154
It's hotter inside. Let's go.

47:05.989 --> 47:09.368
-Did you do the dishes?
-That goes without saying, Dear.

47:12.955 --> 47:16.500
-The beans are ripe already?
-Yes, they are.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.126
Eat this too.

47:19.169 --> 47:20.212
Here.

47:31.890 --> 47:37.229
Children who are molested are
often molested by someone they know.

47:44.069 --> 47:47.239
Sexual offenders are often family,
and most often, the father.

47:53.370 --> 47:54.580
Hey.

47:55.163 --> 47:56.456
Come. Hurry.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.835
-Why?
-It's urgent. Hurry.

48:00.002 --> 48:01.878
My gosh. Hurry.

48:03.505 --> 48:05.757
-What?
-Sit down.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.259
Eat this.

48:08.051 --> 48:11.221
Gross. You're so gross.

48:16.852 --> 48:18.145
My apologies.

48:18.770 --> 48:19.855
For what?

48:20.522 --> 48:23.984
I had an unimaginable thought about you.

48:24.318 --> 48:26.236
I sincerely apologize.

48:28.447 --> 48:29.323
What was it?

48:30.699 --> 48:31.825
I can't say.

48:32.409 --> 48:35.829
Over my dead body.
It's best if you don't know.

48:39.249 --> 48:41.084
My nose is all rotten.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.211
That's why you got prettier.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.759
-Eat the perilla leaves.
-It's yummy.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.010
-Is it?
-Yes.

48:53.305 --> 48:54.765
The plums are small this year.

48:57.768 --> 48:58.852
What are you looking for?

48:59.561 --> 49:01.521
My diaries. Where is it?

49:02.564 --> 49:04.775
What diaries? You don't have one.

49:04.983 --> 49:06.109
You threw them out?

49:06.485 --> 49:10.447
Other moms keep them and give them
to their daughters when they get married.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.533
-I'm adopted, right?
-Why you...

49:14.034 --> 49:16.244
Try writing a diary first.

49:16.620 --> 49:17.829
I didn't?

49:23.377 --> 49:25.921
-Mom!
-What?

49:27.506 --> 49:29.341
Why? What is it?

49:29.424 --> 49:30.676
Who's this?

49:31.426 --> 49:33.887
You little brat.
It's the middle of the night.

49:34.179 --> 49:36.515
It is not. It isn't even 11:00 p.m. yet.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.641
Who is this?

49:38.684 --> 49:41.144
How would I know your friend?

49:41.228 --> 49:43.438
Don't be like that. Look closely.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.034
I don't know! Turn off the light!

49:59.121 --> 50:00.747
I really am adopted, right?

50:03.083 --> 50:06.712
We would've adopted a decent kid then.
Why would we have adopted you?

50:08.338 --> 50:10.757
Exactly. Turn off the light!

50:15.053 --> 50:17.347
-What was that about?
-Whatever.

50:24.229 --> 50:25.355
Pretty shoes.

50:29.985 --> 50:32.279
Hyo-jin Moon, May 10th, 2004
On a field trip

50:36.533 --> 50:37.784
Hyo-jin Moon?

51:05.771 --> 51:08.899
We weren't that close
in high school either.

51:08.982 --> 51:11.610
Then suddenly, they call out of the blue,

51:11.693 --> 51:14.112
and go, "Oh no, you poor thing,"

51:14.196 --> 51:16.448
and their eyes were all sparkly.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.910
"Tell us. It's better for you to talk."

51:19.993 --> 51:22.996
I was so annoyed. Are they my counselors?

51:23.079 --> 51:24.915
They just wanted to know the details.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.708
"Why did you get hit? Did you deserve it?"

51:27.876 --> 51:29.294
I'm so annoyed.

51:29.377 --> 51:30.670
I must be a complete idiot.

51:30.754 --> 51:33.256
I couldn't say anything
and just sat there.

51:34.466 --> 51:38.136
But why did that guy do that?
The one who took your hand and ran away.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.472
I don't know! How would I know?

51:42.265 --> 51:44.351
You should've used that temper there.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.312
You must've gotten better.

51:47.395 --> 51:49.439
You would've frozen stiff before.

51:49.523 --> 51:50.607
Really?

51:51.775 --> 51:55.529
I thought it was a waste of money,
but maybe the psychiatrist is helping.

51:56.112 --> 51:58.073
How long do you have to stay on your meds?

51:58.156 --> 52:01.409
Exactly. The meds are so expensive.
I want to stop...

52:01.493 --> 52:03.495
Hi, General Cho.

52:03.578 --> 52:05.914
You're home late.
Try to come home earlier.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.376
Forget it. Don't be weird.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.131
You know...

52:20.011 --> 52:23.890
Something happened to me last year.

52:26.017 --> 52:28.687
I was seeing someone and we broke up,

52:29.813 --> 52:31.064
but in that process,

52:32.065 --> 52:34.192
something bad happened.

52:37.904 --> 52:38.947
He assaulted me.

52:41.157 --> 52:44.661
I'm still seeing a doctor because of it.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.793
It's nothing good,

52:52.919 --> 52:55.505
and it was awkward to bring up, so...

52:56.464 --> 52:59.801
That's why we ended up
talking among ourselves.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.388
It wasn't intentional.

53:08.268 --> 53:09.394
Okay.

53:15.525 --> 53:18.737
Last year, around Christmas time,
was it just the four of you?

53:19.613 --> 53:20.864
I'm not sure.

53:22.157 --> 53:23.199
What about Yi-na?

53:24.659 --> 53:26.620
How do you know Yi-na?

53:27.662 --> 53:30.206
She's always going,
Yi-na this, Yi-na that.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.335
Sorry.

53:34.210 --> 53:35.253
For what?

53:35.712 --> 53:38.131
For talking about someone you don't know.

53:40.926 --> 53:42.886
When did she move out?

53:43.637 --> 53:46.890
The day after I got back, so October 5th?

53:47.599 --> 53:50.101
Was it just us four during Christmas?

53:50.185 --> 53:53.772
Yes. The vocal music student moved in,
but didn't last a month.

53:53.855 --> 53:57.400
I guess if they leave, they leave quickly,
and if not, they stay long.

53:58.777 --> 54:00.070
Why do you ask?

54:00.654 --> 54:02.322
Nothing. Just...

54:13.208 --> 54:14.376
Why is she General Cho?

54:15.627 --> 54:17.545
Ji-won gave her the nickname.

54:17.629 --> 54:22.258
Cho Eun, Zhao Yun,
the general Zilong, so General Cho.

54:23.551 --> 54:28.890
Eun-jae Yoo: Getting over a breakup,
Have a scar in hand, Depressed

54:35.647 --> 54:37.691
Ye-eun Jung: Assaulted by her ex,
Seeing a shrink

54:51.246 --> 54:53.373
-How did you know?
-Your perfume.

54:54.541 --> 54:57.377
What the heck? You know my perfume?

54:57.794 --> 54:59.254
I'm touched.

55:00.922 --> 55:02.298
What do you want to drink?

55:02.632 --> 55:05.385
Your treat? Strawberry smoothie, please.

55:13.476 --> 55:16.021
Ye-eun Jung. She's your prime suspect?

55:18.106 --> 55:19.733
This really does happen.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.694
What happened to the guy who hit her?

55:23.111 --> 55:24.237
I think he went to jail.

55:25.655 --> 55:28.241
It's weird. Why would a victim
get a letter like that?

55:28.324 --> 55:29.200
Exactly.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.913
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

55:34.497 --> 55:36.499
I thought it would be obvious.

55:37.042 --> 55:39.961
I'm shocked she's lasting
with that nasty temper.

55:40.045 --> 55:43.339
I thought Yi-na would get into fights
with the customers, right?

55:43.423 --> 55:46.092
-She probably fights with the owner.
-Exactly.

55:49.137 --> 55:50.680
She goes like, "What the hell?"

55:51.806 --> 55:53.558
What are you doing? Come on!

55:53.892 --> 55:56.019
I thought someone receiving

55:56.102 --> 55:58.229
a strange letter like this would be
strange and nasty.

55:58.938 --> 56:00.190
You're the strangest.

56:01.399 --> 56:03.902
Who does all of this
to deliver someone else's letter?

56:04.486 --> 56:05.570
You even moved.

56:07.906 --> 56:08.865
Is there

56:10.742 --> 56:11.951
something more?

56:49.197 --> 56:50.406
WE BUY USED BOOKS

57:20.645 --> 57:21.980
Please save me.

57:25.817 --> 57:27.193
Please help me.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.101
DELAYED JUSTICE

58:09.652 --> 58:11.988
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

58:15.158 --> 58:16.951
So? What will you do?

58:18.536 --> 58:21.956
What will you do
once you find the recipient of the letter?

58:35.678 --> 58:39.724
We're doing construction upstairs.
Don't mind the noise.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.693
Let go!

58:50.777 --> 58:53.571
-Let go!
-Please stop.

59:11.339 --> 59:12.173
What now?

59:14.676 --> 59:15.677
No reason.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.513
I just got so pissed off.

59:22.517 --> 59:24.435
The staff here must think you're crazy.

59:26.437 --> 59:27.772
Well, I don't care.

59:40.952 --> 59:41.786
What?

59:45.498 --> 59:46.916
Wasn't this expensive?

59:48.418 --> 59:49.586
Shoot.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.631
You're right. Dang it.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:05.977
I'll make you pay what you did, you bitch.
I won't forgive you. I'll have my revenge.

1:00:34.339 --> 1:00:36.674
I will kill you.

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:41.220
I'm not going to think about it too much.

1:00:41.596 --> 1:00:43.348
To think she might be a good person,

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:46.517
or she had no choice at that time...

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:49.145
That's too tiring.

1:01:04.494 --> 1:01:06.621
I'll either like or hate, not both.

1:01:07.497 --> 1:01:10.500
I'll either be a friend
or an enemy, not both.

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:26.057
I don't want to know too much,

1:01:26.891 --> 1:01:29.018
because I'll feel sorry for her.

1:01:30.019 --> 1:01:34.065
If I feel sorry for her,
I won't be able to hate her.

1:01:38.986 --> 1:01:42.073
I don't want to understand.
I won't try to understand.

1:01:42.824 --> 1:01:45.993
I will not understand. I refuse.

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:48.955
So? What will you do?

1:01:49.372 --> 1:01:53.042
What will you do
once you find the recipient of the letter?

1:02:00.133 --> 1:02:01.676
I'll take revenge for her.

1:02:09.517 --> 1:02:11.436
That very moment,

1:02:11.602 --> 1:02:14.731
the car window went down
and the driver looked at us.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.899
And then? What did you do?

1:02:16.983 --> 1:02:20.069
What else? I put my head down, and said,

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:23.865
"Hello. I'm sorry."

1:02:24.449 --> 1:02:25.491
How embarrassing!

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:26.868
Who is it?

1:02:27.452 --> 1:02:32.457
Which one of you ruined
someone else's life and is laughing now?

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:35.793
What are you doing? Come eat with us.

1:03:06.199 --> 1:03:07.116
Oh my god!

1:03:08.743 --> 1:03:10.411
What the heck? Who is that?

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:12.038
-I'm the owner...
-Don't lie.

1:03:12.121 --> 1:03:13.414
The owner's agent.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:16.793
-Why do you keep looking?
-I didn't look.

1:03:16.876 --> 1:03:19.378
-You keep picturing it, right?
-Why would I?

1:03:19.462 --> 1:03:22.924
The person who lives there
isn't the recipient, but the author?

1:03:23.007 --> 1:03:24.801
The one you want to pick on?

1:03:24.884 --> 1:03:26.052
We're having a party.

1:03:26.135 --> 1:03:28.304
Go and have fun. Eat and drink.

1:03:28.387 --> 1:03:32.308
No one meant to hurt anyone,
but a person was hurt.

1:03:32.391 --> 1:03:34.519
Why did you do that last time?

1:03:34.602 --> 1:03:36.979
-I thought they were bullying you.
-I was grateful.

1:03:37.063 --> 1:03:40.817
Excuse me. Your number.
I need your number to talk later.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:42.109
She's getting a new boyfriend.

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:44.111
Lend me your phone.
You know me, right? Heimdallr.

1:03:44.195 --> 1:03:45.154
I'm in Management, so...

1:03:45.238 --> 1:03:46.989
Wait until we make it big.

1:03:47.073 --> 1:03:49.242
I don't really care. Don't talk to me.

1:03:49.325 --> 1:03:50.576
Do you know Hyo-jin Moon?

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:52.537
Didn't she transfer after the third grade?

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:54.705
-Why did she transfer?
-There was a weird rumor.

1:03:54.789 --> 1:03:56.999
Just how many lies did you tell?

1:04:05.675 --> 1:04:07.510
What are you doing?

1:04:07.635 --> 1:04:09.971
Don't come after me!

1:04:10.054 --> 1:04:11.931
Don't come after me!

1:04:22.817 --> 1:04:24.235
Is this the police station?

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:42.336
When did you pick up this hobby?

1:04:43.754 --> 1:04:46.966
Wait. Let's talk. Excuse me.

1:04:47.925 --> 1:04:49.093
Excuse me.

1:05:04.859 --> 1:05:06.360
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

1:05:17.204 --> 1:05:19.498
