00:06.063 --> 00:07.429
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:18.212 --> 00:19.938
Hey, Tamsin,

00:19.963 --> 00:21.438
did you hear about Marks?

00:21.463 --> 00:23.734
He saved the new Throne
album to the secure drive,

00:23.736 --> 00:26.030
now, boom, his career might be over.

00:26.055 --> 00:27.413
Serves him right.

00:27.432 --> 00:29.485
Throne's sound is a
throwback to the '60s

00:29.510 --> 00:30.853
without the youthful idealism.

00:30.878 --> 00:33.939
That band doesn't deserve to
be saved on the hard drive.

00:37.252 --> 00:38.918
Sir, I'm here to take
in Lieutenant Dale.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.125
She's there.

01:01.887 --> 01:02.952
Stop.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.294
- Lieutenant Dale, stop.
- Freeze!

01:06.319 --> 01:07.935
Stop! Freeze!

01:09.584 --> 01:10.716
Get 'em up!

01:13.346 --> 01:14.854
Colonel Jackson, please,

01:14.879 --> 01:15.916
I can explain...

01:15.941 --> 01:17.344
Lieutenant Tamsin Dale,

01:17.369 --> 01:20.111
you are under arrest per Article 134

01:20.161 --> 01:22.822
for violation of Section 793

01:22.847 --> 01:24.680
of the Espionage Act.

01:30.338 --> 01:31.489
You looking for me?

01:31.514 --> 01:33.572
Yes. A possible client.

01:33.574 --> 01:35.872
Army Lieutenant Tamsin Dale,

01:35.880 --> 01:38.180
facing 111 years in prison.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.816
Charged four times
under the Espionage Act.

01:40.818 --> 01:42.651
Espionage? Whoa.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.754
For who? Russia, China?

01:44.756 --> 01:45.888
Nobody.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.623
Ooh, string cheese.

01:47.625 --> 01:50.041
She leaked a document to a newspaper.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.327
Which newspaper?

01:51.329 --> 01:52.861
It's called GlobeSpill.

01:52.886 --> 01:54.173
- Yeah.
- It's online.

01:54.198 --> 01:58.167
It's like a cross between
Huffington Post and WikiLeaks.

01:58.169 --> 02:01.956
Our lieutenant gave them a memo

02:01.981 --> 02:03.447
about a U.S. bombing in Syria

02:03.472 --> 02:05.275
that accidentally took out a hospital,

02:05.300 --> 02:08.043
killing 36 patients
plus medical personnel.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.211
In the memo,

02:09.213 --> 02:11.922
this colonel basically says that...

02:11.990 --> 02:14.570
he doesn't care about
the civilian casualties

02:14.595 --> 02:17.100
as long as he realized
his tactical goals.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.609
I remember hearing about this.

02:18.634 --> 02:20.852
And the Army made him retire.

02:20.877 --> 02:22.158
He was a big embarrassment.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.059
'Cause the colonel screwed up.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.446
It's not like Tamsin gave the
Russians launch codes or anything.

02:27.471 --> 02:29.620
Lieutenant Dale isn't a spy,

02:29.645 --> 02:31.463
she's a whistle-blower.

02:34.472 --> 02:35.819
Sir.

02:35.844 --> 02:37.981
- Thank you.
- Open up.

02:41.444 --> 02:43.008
Fort Mackman.

02:43.033 --> 02:46.111
Protecting America since 1924.

02:46.136 --> 02:48.767
Did you know the Army is a year
older than the United States?

02:48.792 --> 02:50.697
- True fact.
- Whoa. Bull.

02:50.722 --> 02:52.321
Flag on the play.

02:52.323 --> 02:54.366
This document that
Lieutenant Dale leaked

02:54.391 --> 02:56.392
not only revealed that
the colonel was a jerk

02:56.394 --> 02:59.461
but it also revealed
a classified operation.

02:59.463 --> 03:01.725
This Ranger unit was embedded
near the bombing site.

03:01.750 --> 03:04.533
And after GlobeSpill published,
the unit got attacked.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.329
I'm aware.

03:07.923 --> 03:09.790
This changes things.

03:10.341 --> 03:12.063
Three Rangers died.

03:12.088 --> 03:13.876
Come on, Bull, we can't take this case.

03:13.878 --> 03:15.244
Gonna listen to what she has to say.

03:15.246 --> 03:17.346
If I don't like it, we're gone.

03:17.348 --> 03:18.533
Yeah?

03:19.193 --> 03:20.660
Yeah.

03:20.952 --> 03:23.819
They offered her a plea
deal, but she turned it down.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.439
Said she had to fight for what's right.

03:26.464 --> 03:28.524
The government is
using the Espionage Act

03:28.526 --> 03:31.579
to go after people who
expose government wrongdoing.

03:31.604 --> 03:33.170
Is that who we are now?

03:33.480 --> 03:36.131
Punish our critics with
a century in Leavenworth?

03:38.509 --> 03:40.469
Come on, Counselor, this could be fun.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.804
Court-martial?

03:41.806 --> 03:44.023
Different rules,
different trial science.

03:44.048 --> 03:45.541
We could even put the
president on the stand.

03:45.543 --> 03:48.420
Nobody is putting the
president on the stand.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.690
- Dare to dream.
- Right.

03:50.722 --> 03:52.067
Gentlemen, as the convening authority,

03:52.069 --> 03:54.850
I'm gonna ask that you not turn
this trial into a media circus.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.201
"Convening authority"?

03:56.226 --> 03:57.630
One officer picks the jury pool

03:57.655 --> 03:59.488
and gets to set a lot of the rules.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.523
We don't do a lot of courts-martial,

04:01.525 --> 04:03.192
so I'm gonna ask you to use my office

04:03.194 --> 04:04.758
as the interview space
for Lieutenant Dale.

04:04.782 --> 04:07.132
You were her commanding officer.

04:07.298 --> 04:08.898
Was she your protege?

04:11.927 --> 04:14.203
Tamsin was one of my best analysts.

04:14.205 --> 04:17.050
That's why I requested to
be the convening authority.

04:17.075 --> 04:19.372
- Sergeant, bring her in.
- Yes, sir.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.486
Dr. Bull.

04:30.488 --> 04:33.015
I hope you can help
me, but you should know

04:33.061 --> 04:35.591
- I won't lie to win.
- I don't lie.

04:35.593 --> 04:36.792
I choose facts.

04:36.794 --> 04:38.861
Winning is about which
facts you focus on

04:38.863 --> 04:40.162
and which you choose to ignore.

04:40.164 --> 04:43.332
Different facts matter
to different jurors.

04:43.334 --> 04:45.100
Sounds like lies of omission to me.

04:45.102 --> 04:47.136
Maybe if you're sitting
in a data analyst's chair,

04:47.138 --> 04:48.570
that's the way it sounds.

04:48.572 --> 04:49.645
Not in a jury box.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.273
Clearly you have reservations,

04:51.275 --> 04:52.394
so why are we here?

04:52.419 --> 04:54.083
Why contact Dr. Bull at all?

04:54.108 --> 04:56.946
Because the facts say your
success rate is unparalleled,

04:56.948 --> 04:59.214
and a lot of your
cases looked unwinnable.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.249
That's why.

05:00.251 --> 05:02.309
Tell me about the memo you leaked.

05:02.723 --> 05:05.417
43 civilians died in that bombing.

05:05.442 --> 05:07.098
Colonel Kell said he cared less

05:07.123 --> 05:10.134
about civilian casualties
than his tactical objectives.

05:10.159 --> 05:12.161
Except one of his tactical objectives

05:12.163 --> 05:14.644
is to prevent civilian casualties.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.232
For every civilian we kill,

05:17.234 --> 05:18.777
we make 40 enemies.

05:18.802 --> 05:20.069
So, part of every mission is

05:20.071 --> 05:22.426
try hard not to kill them.

05:22.451 --> 05:24.280
But the colonel's
collateral damage stats

05:24.305 --> 05:26.090
were 30% higher than his peers.

05:26.115 --> 05:28.030
Unless he was stopped, it
was going to happen again.

05:28.032 --> 05:30.125
You're a lieutenant and
you get to decide this?

05:30.150 --> 05:31.819
I went through the chain of command.

05:31.844 --> 05:32.957
Nothing happened.

05:32.982 --> 05:35.444
And the colonel continued
his reckless engagements.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.586
So, I went to my ultimate boss.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.122
The American people? Come on.

05:40.124 --> 05:41.873
It's why I signed up in the first place.

05:41.898 --> 05:44.304
I'm fighting this because
I did nothing wrong.

05:44.329 --> 05:46.662
The secret Ranger unit might disagree.

05:46.687 --> 05:49.465
Wasn't a covert unit exposed
and three soldiers killed

05:49.467 --> 05:51.200
because you leaked that memo?

05:51.202 --> 05:53.335
Then why am I not
charged with their deaths?

05:53.337 --> 05:54.903
You tell me.

05:57.228 --> 05:58.531
The memo...

05:58.556 --> 06:00.642
there's classified intel out there

06:00.667 --> 06:02.421
that's not what you think.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.645
Okay.

06:05.383 --> 06:07.116
Talk, Tamsin,

06:07.305 --> 06:09.104
or we're out of here.

06:11.055 --> 06:13.288
I'm not saying anything
about the Ranger unit

06:13.290 --> 06:15.163
until you have security clearance.

06:15.188 --> 06:17.626
So... you're just not going to say.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.014
I can't.

06:19.039 --> 06:21.005
Okay, I guess we're out of here.

06:21.030 --> 06:22.374
Nothing.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.900
Even with your life at stake.

06:25.194 --> 06:26.635
Why'd you release the document?

06:26.637 --> 06:28.771
One sentence, don't think
about it, just say it now.

06:28.773 --> 06:30.839
I love my country.

06:32.916 --> 06:34.992
You may think it sounds hokey,

06:35.017 --> 06:36.879
but we're the greatest
nation in history,

06:36.881 --> 06:38.213
or supposed to be...

06:38.215 --> 06:40.449
and then this colonel
comes along and says

06:40.451 --> 06:44.653
he doesn't care if we
kill innocent people.

06:47.201 --> 06:48.323
All right.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.492
You have a jury consultant

06:50.494 --> 06:51.927
and a really good lawyer.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.934
You took the case anyway.

06:58.936 --> 07:01.070
Even though she wouldn't
discuss the Ranger attack.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.171
Exactly.

07:02.173 --> 07:04.960
Her life is at stake
and she won't talk...

07:04.985 --> 07:08.093
and yet she leaked
information to save others.

07:08.118 --> 07:09.358
Or maybe you just like her

07:09.383 --> 07:11.216
because she breaks
the rules like you do.

07:11.241 --> 07:12.614
She's a soldier, Bull.

07:12.616 --> 07:15.017
She doesn't get to pick
and choose what she tells.

07:15.019 --> 07:17.493
She's gonna win you over. I can feel it.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.235
For Lieutenant Dale's case,
we have a few new rules.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.470
Like...

07:23.495 --> 07:24.540
no hacking.

07:24.565 --> 07:25.865
Just send me home, why don't you?

07:25.889 --> 07:28.351
We will be profiling the
jury, just like always,

07:28.376 --> 07:30.610
but this is a national security case.

07:30.635 --> 07:31.700
Take it from me, certain people

07:31.702 --> 07:33.168
will be watching everything we do.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.970
But you're saying there's no hacking.

07:34.972 --> 07:37.039
Okay, just think of it as an adventure.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.821
Like... a camping trip,

07:38.846 --> 07:40.609
in nature, no electricity.

07:40.611 --> 07:41.877
- Or toilets.
- Camping?

07:41.879 --> 07:43.052
Okay, no hacking,

07:43.077 --> 07:45.550
no sneaking, no undercover anything.

07:45.575 --> 07:47.404
If you want to find out
about potential jurors,

07:47.428 --> 07:49.966
you use public documents,
neighbors and colleagues.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.784
How many jurors are in the initial pool?

07:51.809 --> 07:53.979
It's officers only, so
Benny thinks about 30.

07:54.004 --> 07:55.356
Guess I'll gas up my car.

07:55.358 --> 07:57.754
And we are...

07:58.262 --> 08:00.182
going off the grid,

08:00.207 --> 08:02.504
- except for my computer...
- Be strong.

08:02.529 --> 08:04.766
Which is air-gapped
and externally booted.

08:04.768 --> 08:07.823
I will input the information
into the algorithm,

08:07.848 --> 08:10.434
and the completed
profiles will go there...

08:10.459 --> 08:11.992
and on paper.

08:17.945 --> 08:19.047
Paper.

08:19.049 --> 08:20.215
So, how'd the team take it?

08:20.217 --> 08:22.885
I told them it would
be fun, like camping.

08:22.887 --> 08:25.254
Marissa, have you ever been camping?

08:25.256 --> 08:27.189
Any more fun I should know about?

08:28.222 --> 08:29.791
Sure, with courts-martial,

08:29.793 --> 08:32.027
there's no hung juries.

08:32.029 --> 08:33.662
We get a verdict,

08:33.664 --> 08:36.331
and it only takes 3/4 of
the jury to find you guilty.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.633
Well, there are 12 jurors,

08:37.635 --> 08:39.052
so we need four to acquit.

08:39.077 --> 08:41.724
Wait, who stole my string cheese?

08:43.669 --> 08:45.474
Here. Better for you.

08:46.388 --> 08:47.754
Worst of all,

08:47.779 --> 08:50.579
we only get to boot one
juror out in voir dire.

08:50.581 --> 08:51.680
Ouch.

08:51.682 --> 08:53.148
Jury selection is the key to trial.

08:53.150 --> 08:54.865
- It's our forte.
- Yes, it is,

08:54.890 --> 08:57.071
which is why I have a new strategy.

08:57.096 --> 08:58.720
If we only get one strike,

08:58.722 --> 09:01.356
we have to avoid the nuclear juror.

09:02.493 --> 09:05.127
- Nuclear.
- He or she is the one

09:05.152 --> 09:07.267
with the quality our research reveals

09:07.292 --> 09:09.198
is the most toxic to our defense:

09:09.200 --> 09:11.386
A strict constructionist.

09:11.411 --> 09:13.134
No Thomas Jeffersons.

09:13.159 --> 09:14.413
No one who believes

09:14.438 --> 09:16.782
in the literal interpretation of rules.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.585
They'll never forgive
you for leaking the memo.

09:18.609 --> 09:20.594
Avoid anyone who's never seen combat,

09:20.619 --> 09:24.112
who enlisted for the structure
rather than the adventure.

09:24.114 --> 09:26.032
You know how many we'll have?

09:26.057 --> 09:27.205
"Army Strong."

09:27.230 --> 09:28.270
Let's move along, counsel.

09:28.294 --> 09:30.870
I want to be done with
voir dire in one hour.

09:31.574 --> 09:32.888
Hey, where's Tanaka?

09:32.890 --> 09:35.434
- I thought Tanaka was a nuclear juror.
- No, Marissa cleared her.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.956
Now we have Vikowitz, Lambert,

09:36.981 --> 09:38.464
and the one I can't pronounce.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.885
Here are the last of the profiles.

09:39.910 --> 09:42.719
My algorithms say that we
have one more possible nuke:

09:42.744 --> 09:45.266
Major Crumpler, come on down.

09:45.291 --> 09:46.839
Marissa, we need a name.

09:46.864 --> 09:48.230
Benny's running out of time.

09:48.232 --> 09:49.681
Mr. Coln.

09:50.158 --> 09:53.149
Do you wish to exercise your
peremptory challenge or not?

09:53.174 --> 09:54.603
Yes, yes, of course.

09:54.605 --> 09:56.266
Please, one moment.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.407
Bull, we have four Jeffersonians:

09:58.409 --> 10:01.100
Crumpler, Lambert, Vikowitz,
how do you pronounce that?

10:01.125 --> 10:02.611
Hey, so it looks like Lambert's

10:02.613 --> 10:04.125
packing the highest megatons.

10:04.150 --> 10:05.258
Never been overseas,

10:05.283 --> 10:08.500
and he has seven bumper
stickers on his car.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.969
They did a study.

10:09.994 --> 10:11.203
The more bumper stickers you have,

10:11.227 --> 10:12.360
the more road rage-y you are.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.485
Okay, Bull, did you get that?

10:13.509 --> 10:14.829
Lambert is a rule stickler,

10:14.831 --> 10:16.085
and he has anger issues.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.765
What leadership score
did you give Lambert?

10:17.767 --> 10:20.234
Grading on the officer curve... yikes.

10:20.236 --> 10:22.231
He's only 50th percentile.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.685
Looks like Lambert, juror
number one, is our nuke.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.155
Mr. Colon.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.428
Two.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.717
Yes. Colonel.

10:29.742 --> 10:31.131
We would like to thank

10:31.156 --> 10:34.012
and excuse juror number
two, Major Vikowitz.

10:34.037 --> 10:36.084
Vikowitz? Bull, did you hear me?

10:36.109 --> 10:37.576
Everything is pointing to Lambert.

10:37.601 --> 10:40.127
Lieutenant Szentgyorgyi.

10:40.152 --> 10:41.351
Please join us.

10:42.504 --> 10:44.807
We have our panel. Ladies
and gentlemen, thank you.

10:44.832 --> 10:46.942
Please report tomorrow at 0900.

10:47.019 --> 10:48.887
Counsel will now have a motions hearing.

10:48.912 --> 10:51.028
Mr. Colon, please follow Major Barnett.

10:51.129 --> 10:52.317
This session is adjourned.

10:52.614 --> 10:54.246
Follow me, Mr. Colon.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.015
Why Vikowitz?

11:01.064 --> 11:03.339
Not smiling, head still.

11:03.366 --> 11:05.369
Did you see the way he
steepled his fingers?

11:05.394 --> 11:06.868
Signs of a leader.

11:06.870 --> 11:11.039
And a nuclear leader is much
worse than a nuclear follower.

11:11.619 --> 11:13.323
Who's that guy?

11:13.348 --> 11:15.838
The suit? Never seen him before.

11:18.182 --> 11:19.768
Hang tough, soldier.

11:22.064 --> 11:23.994
Major Barnett, quick question.

11:24.019 --> 11:26.052
Tamsin said something odd the other day.

11:26.077 --> 11:28.266
She wasn't charged with
revealing the Ranger unit.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.447
- Why was that?
- Your client's facing life.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.938
That's not enough for you?

11:32.729 --> 11:34.246
Well, soldiers died.

11:34.271 --> 11:36.620
Aiding the enemy is a stronger charge

11:36.645 --> 11:39.378
than stretching the
Espionage Act like that.

11:39.403 --> 11:40.870
Haven't the families demanded it?

11:40.895 --> 11:43.440
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Colon
and I have to take a trip.

11:43.465 --> 11:44.598
Trip?

11:44.623 --> 11:46.389
I thought we were
having a motions hearing.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.699
'Cause I'm making a motion
about a classified document,

11:51.723 --> 11:53.356
the hearing will be
held at a black site.

11:53.742 --> 11:54.948
Black site.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.261
Cool.

11:58.488 --> 12:00.065
Attorneys only, sir.

12:00.572 --> 12:01.651
Got it.

12:06.382 --> 12:08.860
The one time I might
want to be a lawyer.

12:22.939 --> 12:24.764
By signing this security memorandum,

12:24.789 --> 12:27.123
you agree never to share, speak of

12:27.125 --> 12:28.958
or acknowledge the existence

12:28.960 --> 12:31.470
of classified documents in this case.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.995
And if you do any of those
things, Mr. Colon, be warned.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.054
You can be jailed up to ten years.

12:36.619 --> 12:38.345
I understand.

12:40.972 --> 12:42.438
We're on the record.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.581
So where's the mysterious document?

12:45.606 --> 12:47.130
This is part of discovery.

12:47.155 --> 12:49.345
But you weren't allowed to
view it till you had clearance.

12:49.347 --> 12:51.380
It's the memo Tamsin Dale uploaded

12:51.382 --> 12:53.796
to GlobeSpill on 7 January.

12:54.872 --> 12:56.700
Wait a minute. This is what she leaked?

12:56.913 --> 12:58.538
No, this is different.

12:58.563 --> 13:01.090
Your Honor, I move to enter
this as Defense Exhibit 1.

13:01.092 --> 13:03.859
Colonel, I object. This
hearing was called for a motion

13:03.884 --> 13:05.218
to exclude this document from trial.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.693
Are you kidding me?

13:08.132 --> 13:10.443
Your Honor, this could set her free.

13:23.881 --> 13:25.304
Can I help you?

13:25.361 --> 13:26.538
Hey.

13:26.563 --> 13:27.694
Yeah, sorry about your wall.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.952
Marissa won't let me
do this on a computer.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.143
Vandalize it?

13:31.168 --> 13:32.942
Making a timeline.

13:33.716 --> 13:35.301
Something's bugging me.

13:35.326 --> 13:37.703
January 7, Lieutenant Dale uploads

13:37.728 --> 13:40.714
the classified memo
to GlobeSpill, then...

13:40.739 --> 13:43.232
GlobeSpill publishes it online. What...

13:43.234 --> 13:45.434
What's "S-C-T Ranger U" mean?

13:45.436 --> 13:46.669
It's a secret Ranger unit.

13:46.671 --> 13:48.667
Their location was revealed in the memo.

13:48.692 --> 13:51.526
Who abbreviates "secret" with "S-C-T"?

13:51.846 --> 13:53.475
Everyone's a critic.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.087
Point is,

13:55.112 --> 13:56.792
terrorists attacked the Ranger unit

13:56.817 --> 13:58.618
after their location was revealed.

13:58.643 --> 14:01.831
Sergeants Valeo, Frakes and
Lieutenant Kleeman were killed.

14:01.856 --> 14:03.096
- It's tragic.
- Yeah,

14:03.121 --> 14:04.862
but when they arrested our defendant,

14:04.887 --> 14:07.666
they didn't charge
her with that. Why not?

14:07.830 --> 14:09.058
There must be a reason.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.827
Uncovering other people's
secrets is like catnip to you.

14:11.829 --> 14:13.276
But you keep yours to yourself.

14:13.301 --> 14:14.968
Vicious slander.

14:16.337 --> 14:18.103
Thanks for the wall.

14:21.539 --> 14:23.072
How was the hearing?

14:23.074 --> 14:24.873
Or was it all just a
terrible misunderstanding

14:24.875 --> 14:28.244
and you're now the oldest
Chi Phi pledge at Hudson?

14:34.051 --> 14:36.785
"What the U.S. Army Won't Let You Know."

14:36.787 --> 14:38.721
Wow. GlobeSpill's Web site

14:38.723 --> 14:40.456
certainly knows how to sell a memo.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.891
I can't talk about the black site, Bull.

14:44.855 --> 14:46.325
Okay.

14:47.308 --> 14:48.755
Have a good night.

14:56.053 --> 15:00.653
So you're using the jury
profiles to manipulate the jury.

15:00.678 --> 15:02.378
To know the jury.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.113
Everyone looks at life through a filter.

15:04.115 --> 15:06.882
Some people are
cheerful, some suspicious.

15:06.884 --> 15:10.819
Some have an impudent
disregard for trial science.

15:10.821 --> 15:12.187
Impudent.

15:13.391 --> 15:16.236
Profiles help us see
what color that filter is.

15:16.525 --> 15:19.194
So you can choose facts.

15:19.665 --> 15:21.868
Well, let me ask you. Which
facts do you like better:

15:21.893 --> 15:25.087
That you're a spy who
released classified documents?

15:25.142 --> 15:26.626
Or a patriotic American

15:26.651 --> 15:29.305
who exposed gross misconduct
to save innocent lives?

15:29.307 --> 15:30.814
They're all facts.

15:34.145 --> 15:36.880
Look at juror
number four, Hernandez.

15:36.905 --> 15:38.537
- I thought he was in your corner.
- So?

15:38.562 --> 15:39.695
He's angry.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.155
Look at his hands. They're
clenched into fists.

15:42.988 --> 15:45.778
Okay. The profiles show that
juror number four is our leader.

15:45.803 --> 15:47.092
Captain Jack Hernandez.

15:47.117 --> 15:48.990
His wife had an affair last year.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.576
Finally the gardener told him,

15:50.600 --> 15:51.913
and he gave the guy a raise.

15:51.938 --> 15:53.156
So he didn't shoot the messenger.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.781
So the captain may think our
client did the right thing

15:55.806 --> 15:57.937
by spilling a secret.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.585
Problem?

16:00.695 --> 16:02.871
National secrets are
secret for a reason.

16:02.873 --> 16:05.442
Lieutenant Dale uploaded
a classified document...

16:05.467 --> 16:06.713
not cool.

16:06.738 --> 16:08.078
I mean, help me out, Homeland. Come on.

16:08.102 --> 16:10.941
Sorry, not me. We overclassify
too many documents.

16:10.966 --> 16:12.933
Label it top secret 'cause it's easier

16:12.958 --> 16:15.691
and covers our bases, not because
it actually reveals anything.

16:15.863 --> 16:17.753
- Anything? Come on.
- Once, an analyst

16:17.755 --> 16:19.289
gave me an article from
The Guardian to read.

16:19.313 --> 16:22.435
It gave me new information on
a terrorist I'd been tracking.

16:22.460 --> 16:23.632
Because I read it,

16:23.657 --> 16:25.053
- it was classified.
- Seriously?

16:25.078 --> 16:27.044
Seven billion people in
the world could read it.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.514
But I could only discuss it with people

16:28.538 --> 16:29.865
who had the right clearance.

16:29.867 --> 16:32.168
I'm sorry... is the air out? Hell.

16:32.170 --> 16:34.070
HVAC repair guy's on his way.

16:38.666 --> 16:39.843
Something wrong?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.805
This monitor has been down for hours,

16:41.830 --> 16:44.541
like every computer
in the office but mine.

16:44.566 --> 16:45.748
So why is it blinking?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.149
And the printer's down.

16:47.151 --> 16:48.818
Monitor, air.

16:48.820 --> 16:51.254
Damn it. Cable, I need
your help. My room!

16:51.256 --> 16:52.588
Your... your room?

16:52.590 --> 16:54.991
You're letting me go to your room?

16:56.794 --> 16:58.456
In 1987,

16:58.481 --> 17:00.663
Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree

17:00.665 --> 17:03.610
gave U.S. secrets to his KGB handler.

17:03.635 --> 17:05.201
He was a spy.

17:05.203 --> 17:06.461
John Walker,

17:06.486 --> 17:08.896
a Navy chief warrant officer,

17:08.921 --> 17:11.273
sold encrypted documents

17:11.276 --> 17:15.046
to the Soviet Union for 17 years.

17:15.546 --> 17:17.288
He was a spy.

17:19.444 --> 17:21.325
Lieutenant Tamsin Dale

17:21.349 --> 17:24.810
uploaded a memo to a media outlet.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.247
And yet she's charged with espionage,

17:27.271 --> 17:29.359
just like Lonetree and Walker?

17:29.414 --> 17:30.780
She wanted to help.

17:30.782 --> 17:32.782
Juror number four has
closed body posture.

17:32.784 --> 17:35.952
He's holding himself rigid,
has his hands clasped together.

17:35.977 --> 17:38.287
- He's not feeling us at all.
- She wanted to help the Army.

17:38.311 --> 17:39.533
Has something flipped him?

17:39.558 --> 17:40.858
And she succeeded.

17:40.883 --> 17:43.723
The Army fixed the problem.
And yet here we are.

17:43.748 --> 17:45.950
- And number nine. McNamara.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

17:45.975 --> 17:47.063
He's loving Benny.

17:47.065 --> 17:49.023
He was supposed to be
our biggest challenge.

17:49.048 --> 17:50.126
And Lieutenant Tamsin Dale is not a spy.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.180
Marissa?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.435
- I need a minute, Bull.
- She's a person who loves her country

17:52.437 --> 17:53.636
and this army.

17:54.150 --> 17:55.506
She just wanted to help.

17:55.531 --> 17:57.203
I knew one of those Rangers.

17:57.228 --> 17:59.189
The ones they won't talk about.

17:59.678 --> 18:03.680
Who died and made Lieutenant
Dale secretary of defense?

18:03.935 --> 18:06.348
I think I'll watch Westworld tonight.

18:06.513 --> 18:09.018
Okay. Jurors five and 12 are off, too.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.920
Have they flipped?

18:12.510 --> 18:14.142
Marissa, I need you.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.306
I can't shut it down.

18:15.331 --> 18:16.870
I think it's drawing
power from the HVAC.

18:16.894 --> 18:17.993
That's not possible.

18:18.018 --> 18:20.452
Try rerouting but shut it off.

18:20.532 --> 18:23.666
Juror four hasn't flipped. Nobody has.

18:23.668 --> 18:25.957
The juror profiles, they're wrong.

18:25.982 --> 18:28.182
How is that possible, they're wrong?

18:28.207 --> 18:29.339
Wrong like sabotaged.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.259
Someone has altered the underlying data.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.597
Screw this.

18:35.038 --> 18:36.130
Ooh!

18:36.155 --> 18:38.171
Bull, we've been hacked.

18:51.669 --> 18:52.708
What are we looking at?

18:52.739 --> 18:55.073
The juror profiles created by my system

18:55.075 --> 18:56.307
are garbage.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.727
The hackers altered the data days ago.

18:57.751 --> 18:59.168
Days ago. And we just noticed?

18:59.193 --> 19:00.535
It was a side-channel attack.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.143
They couldn't access my drives directly

19:02.168 --> 19:04.622
so they got into our printers,
our lights, even the HVAC.

19:04.647 --> 19:06.909
Then used E.M. emissions to
work out the encryption key.

19:06.934 --> 19:09.293
It's actually pretty
brilliant. Sorry, Marissa.

19:09.318 --> 19:12.357
The intrusion started a cascading
overload of our hacked systems,

19:12.359 --> 19:13.978
which eventually began to malfunction.

19:14.003 --> 19:15.853
Otherwise we never
would have realized it.

19:15.878 --> 19:17.017
Well, Bull did.

19:17.042 --> 19:19.244
So, Gonzalez just called a recess

19:19.269 --> 19:21.232
so we can get a handle on things.

19:21.234 --> 19:22.924
- Who did this?
- Not the Army.

19:22.949 --> 19:25.183
- It's not their style.
- The worm's engine is encrypted;

19:25.207 --> 19:26.996
Same architecture as the Doji worm.

19:27.021 --> 19:29.384
It looks a lot like
the B0r0lo Group. China.

19:29.409 --> 19:31.191
- China.
- Right.

19:31.216 --> 19:32.916
Something you'd like to add?

19:33.457 --> 19:35.215
Well, it's just...

19:35.240 --> 19:38.040
GlobeSpill is associated
with Chinese hackers, right?

19:38.065 --> 19:40.363
Well, that's a rumor. NSA hasn't
been able to track it down.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.090
I mean, officially, anyway.

19:42.136 --> 19:44.689
Well, GlobeSpill may want...

19:44.691 --> 19:47.091
Tamsin locked up and forgotten about.

19:47.093 --> 19:49.700
So that they could cover
up something they did.

19:50.888 --> 19:52.794
Can you build new juror profiles?

19:52.819 --> 19:53.982
Not until we find the worm.

19:54.007 --> 19:55.706
You and Cable do that. Benny.

19:55.731 --> 19:57.669
Talk to me for a second.

19:59.374 --> 20:00.838
Not only is the Army against us

20:00.840 --> 20:02.179
but also a major media outlet

20:02.204 --> 20:04.882
and now possibly China. Why?

20:05.219 --> 20:07.328
What happened at the black site?

20:08.991 --> 20:10.733
I'm sorry, Bull. I-I can't.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.138
Just like Tamsin. It's
cuter when she does it.

20:13.163 --> 20:15.720
GlobeSpill did something wrong. What?

20:18.564 --> 20:22.599
The answer is in a classified
document that I can't discuss,

20:22.624 --> 20:23.656
that's been excluded.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.463
Does this document
explain why our client

20:25.465 --> 20:27.263
wasn't charged with the attack
on the hidden Ranger unit?

20:27.287 --> 20:29.154
If I tell you, we
will both go to prison.

20:29.179 --> 20:30.244
It's our client's life!

20:30.269 --> 20:31.614
And she will...

20:32.746 --> 20:34.496
she will say the same thing.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.966
We cannot disclose
classified information.

20:39.745 --> 20:42.079
What if told you I didn't want you to?

20:44.918 --> 20:46.286
Have a seat.

20:52.692 --> 20:55.839
I'm gonna ask you questions
that are not about the secret

20:55.864 --> 20:57.058
and you can answer freely.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.340
And then I'm gonna ask you questions

20:59.365 --> 21:01.621
that I don't want you to answer.

21:02.987 --> 21:04.554
- Hello.
- Trust me.

21:05.754 --> 21:07.413
It's just a dyad.

21:07.438 --> 21:09.714
Don't freak out. I'm just
monitoring your pulse.

21:09.739 --> 21:10.971
Wow.

21:10.996 --> 21:13.481
Could have bought me a drink first.

21:14.047 --> 21:15.947
Maybe later.

21:16.301 --> 21:17.824
Okay.

21:17.849 --> 21:19.549
Now I'm gonna ask you a
question you can answer

21:19.573 --> 21:21.529
without violating any rules.

21:21.554 --> 21:22.809
Yes or no:

21:22.834 --> 21:24.935
Is there something I don't
know about GlobeSpill?

21:26.193 --> 21:27.918
Yes.

21:29.066 --> 21:31.965
People, they don't have to talk to tell.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.023
Your pulse is the answer.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.667
And the micro-expressions on your face.

21:37.121 --> 21:40.456
Now I'm gonna ask you a question
I don't want you to answer.

21:40.481 --> 21:43.004
Did GlobeSpill do anything illegal?

21:44.764 --> 21:47.532
Has GlobeSpill reported
false information?

21:47.965 --> 21:49.324
Really?

21:49.349 --> 21:52.617
Does the false information
relate to Tamsin's...

21:52.642 --> 21:54.239
leaked memo?

21:54.264 --> 21:57.423
Does the false information
relate to the Ranger attack?

21:57.893 --> 22:01.056
Has GlobeSpill reported
false information?

22:01.081 --> 22:02.532
Really?

22:08.568 --> 22:11.451
Tamsin didn't betray those
Rangers. GlobeSpill did.

22:11.476 --> 22:12.575
GlobeSpill? How?

22:12.600 --> 22:14.403
I'm not confirming any of this.

22:14.428 --> 22:16.342
When Tamsin leaked
the memo to GlobeSpill,

22:16.367 --> 22:18.951
she altered it. She removed
all sensitive information,

22:18.976 --> 22:22.115
except what the colonel said
about civilian casualties.

22:22.140 --> 22:25.693
She redacted it, just like we
redact documents all the time.

22:26.364 --> 22:29.135
GlobeSpill knew a memo
with a bunch of holes in it

22:29.168 --> 22:30.416
wasn't gonna make a splash.

22:30.441 --> 22:32.651
I mean, a mean colonel? Yawn.

22:32.784 --> 22:35.500
But a secret Ranger
base, that's a scoop.

22:35.525 --> 22:36.784
So they filled in the holes

22:36.807 --> 22:38.907
using information they had
on the Rangers' location?

22:38.909 --> 22:40.575
Ended up aiding in the attack

22:40.577 --> 22:42.544
that killed Kleeman, Valeo and Frakes.

22:42.546 --> 22:44.069
The GlobeSpill people should be in jail,

22:44.093 --> 22:46.447
but how did they even know
where the Rangers were?

22:46.449 --> 22:49.068
Well, maybe when they were
looking into the bombing,

22:49.093 --> 22:50.279
they found another source.

22:50.304 --> 22:52.237
Maybe it was the Chinese government.

22:52.262 --> 22:54.661
Regardless, we know it wasn't Tamsin.

22:54.686 --> 22:56.924
Because the Army did not charge her.

22:56.945 --> 22:59.571
- They knew she didn't do it.
- Army is playing by the rules.

22:59.596 --> 23:01.098
But then why prosecute her at all

23:01.123 --> 23:02.484
if she didn't directly hurt anyone?

23:02.508 --> 23:06.202
Precedent. The Army wants
to come down hard on leakers.

23:06.227 --> 23:08.281
Look at Private Manning
a couple of years ago.

23:08.306 --> 23:10.795
But Manning leaked tens
of thousands of documents.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.171
Lieutenant Dale only leaked one.

23:12.196 --> 23:14.656
Under the Espionage
Act, it doesn't matter.

23:14.681 --> 23:16.171
The crime is the leak,

23:16.196 --> 23:17.570
not who got hurt.

23:17.595 --> 23:20.101
Can only argue lack
of harm at sentencing.

23:20.226 --> 23:22.126
After she's been convicted.

23:31.295 --> 23:32.728
You're early.

23:32.753 --> 23:34.586
I know about the memo you leaked.

23:34.611 --> 23:36.144
The real one.

23:36.169 --> 23:38.469
I know you didn't get
those soldiers killed.

23:47.798 --> 23:50.598
That must have felt pretty lonely.

23:50.623 --> 23:52.557
Not being able to tell.

23:55.846 --> 23:58.004
Exhausting, mostly.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.605
Have a seat.

24:09.733 --> 24:11.866
So, tell me one thing:

24:12.897 --> 24:15.233
Why play the martyr?

24:16.350 --> 24:19.073
I was trying to do the right thing.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.776
Saving yourself isn't the right thing?

24:30.620 --> 24:32.160
The case is going badly.

24:32.185 --> 24:34.137
If we could just bring
up the real memo...

24:35.287 --> 24:36.896
I'm going to prison.

24:36.921 --> 24:38.269
Maybe.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.388
Why are you telling me this?

24:41.413 --> 24:44.080
Because I want you to know
what you're up against.

24:45.473 --> 24:47.388
No more secrets.

24:58.799 --> 25:02.450
Dr. Bull told me the
situation about my case.

25:02.646 --> 25:05.269
Well, your testimony will help.

25:06.153 --> 25:08.526
Thank you for representing me.

25:08.604 --> 25:10.237
I know you didn't want to.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.237
Yeah, well,

25:13.262 --> 25:15.346
I blew up my career once, too.

25:15.698 --> 25:17.166
In the D.A.'s office.

25:17.191 --> 25:19.100
This guy was going away for something

25:19.102 --> 25:20.244
he didn't do, and, um...

25:20.269 --> 25:22.065
You threw yourself on a grenade.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.471
To save him.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.121
I looked you up, Mr. Colon.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.472
I like facts, remember?

25:32.779 --> 25:33.878
Come on.

25:35.603 --> 25:38.649
And that's why I went up
the chain of command first.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.820
It was only when I received no response,

25:40.845 --> 25:43.649
I decided to share the
memo with GlobeSpill.

25:43.674 --> 25:45.250
I tried to play by the rules.

25:45.275 --> 25:46.741
Thank you, Lieutenant.

25:46.766 --> 25:48.555
I tried, but it didn't work.

25:48.609 --> 25:51.243
That's why I want to tell
you the truth about the memo.

25:51.268 --> 25:52.453
Thank you.

25:52.478 --> 25:53.577
That'll be all.

25:53.602 --> 25:54.734
Your witness.

25:54.759 --> 25:55.851
See, they classified it,

25:55.876 --> 25:57.388
so you wouldn't know
what really happened.

25:57.412 --> 25:58.826
- Tamsin!
- Lieutenant, stop,

25:58.860 --> 26:00.157
you'll only make things
worse for yourself.

26:00.181 --> 26:02.643
- You know who got those Rangers killed?
- GlobeSpill.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.531
GlobeSpill did it, not Lieutenant Dale.

26:04.556 --> 26:06.406
- Benny, don't.
- Dr. Bull, sit down.

26:06.445 --> 26:07.756
Mr. Colon, silence.

26:07.781 --> 26:09.450
She uploaded a redacted document.

26:09.452 --> 26:11.919
No classified information,
no Ranger unit.

26:11.921 --> 26:14.413
GlobeSpill filled in the
blanks, got those Rangers killed.

26:14.438 --> 26:16.835
- It was GlobeSpill.
- Mr. Colon, stop.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.929
The members will disregard
Mr. Colon's outburst

26:18.954 --> 26:20.310
and the allegations in it.

26:20.335 --> 26:22.497
Those allegations shall play no part

26:22.499 --> 26:23.937
in your deliberations.

26:23.962 --> 26:25.628
Colonel Gonzalez, I move for a recess,

26:25.653 --> 26:28.152
and can we please absent the panel?

26:28.888 --> 26:30.676
You know what happens now.

26:30.701 --> 26:32.567
The FBI comes to TAC and arrests me.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.193
No. They're gonna do it right here.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.502
FBI. Special Agent Jim Riley.

26:38.075 --> 26:40.371
- Listen carefully.
- Sir, I need you to step aside.

26:40.396 --> 26:41.401
Now.

26:41.426 --> 26:42.786
Benjamin Colon,

26:42.811 --> 26:46.563
you are under arrest for
violating Section 793

26:46.588 --> 26:48.332
of the Espionage Act.

27:01.701 --> 27:03.130
Make a statement.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.146
Benny, this is your last
chance to help yourself.

27:05.171 --> 27:06.491
You know what I always tell my clients?

27:06.515 --> 27:08.617
Remain silent, idiots.

27:09.388 --> 27:10.424
If I make a statement,

27:10.426 --> 27:12.380
how can I ever look
them in the eye again?

27:13.863 --> 27:15.825
Hey, Jimmy. We,
we need five minutes.

27:15.850 --> 27:17.583
I cleared it with Paul.

27:18.466 --> 27:20.341
Must have called in a lot of favors.

27:20.366 --> 27:23.114
Special Agent Riley, Dr. Jason Bull.

27:23.139 --> 27:25.982
Big fan. How's your case
coming against GlobeSpill?

27:26.421 --> 27:29.357
That's why you've been in
the court-martial, isn't it?

27:29.698 --> 27:33.633
Gathering ammunition for
your... espionage charge

27:33.658 --> 27:35.224
somewhere down the road?

27:37.407 --> 27:39.741
Sorry your guy got caught up.

27:42.876 --> 27:44.976
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

27:45.394 --> 27:48.093
Our client was about to spill
classified intel in open court.

27:48.118 --> 27:50.444
I know. I told her to.

27:51.712 --> 27:52.787
You went behind my back?

27:52.812 --> 27:55.180
She had to tell the jury she
didn't get those Rangers killed.

27:55.204 --> 27:56.431
They would have charged her, Bull,

27:56.455 --> 27:57.854
on another count of espionage.

27:57.879 --> 27:59.546
It was a tactical decision.

27:59.571 --> 28:02.594
Maybe she gets charged, maybe
she beats all the charges.

28:02.657 --> 28:04.805
- She agreed.
- Always going for the big win?

28:04.830 --> 28:06.719
I told you to trust me.

28:06.744 --> 28:09.378
- When you didn't trust me!
- I was trying to protect you,

28:09.403 --> 28:11.762
so you wouldn't get arrested.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.740
You should go, Bull.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.915
I mean it.

28:18.427 --> 28:19.985
Get out.

28:30.863 --> 28:32.937
Cable is trying to find
the digital warhead.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.640
She scrubbed maybe 20%,

28:34.665 --> 28:36.844
but I'm just not sure
how much longer we have.

28:36.846 --> 28:39.517
- Until what?
- Until we're raided by the FBI.

28:40.216 --> 28:41.993
You're kidding, right?

28:42.018 --> 28:44.895
- The FBI's coming here?
- As soon as they get a warrant.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.804
The Feds are not gonna get a
peek at our clients' business.

28:47.829 --> 28:50.130
Be ready to hit the kill switch.

28:52.179 --> 28:54.849
Colonel Jackson. Hey.

28:54.874 --> 28:56.998
You seem like a good
guy, is what I don't get,

28:57.023 --> 28:58.037
being all you can be.

28:58.062 --> 28:59.873
I bet your soldiers look up to you.

28:59.898 --> 29:01.598
And I bet they're right to.

29:01.971 --> 29:04.865
I imagine you're gonna wheel
up next to a point any day now.

29:04.890 --> 29:07.557
How could you convene a trial
when you knew Lieutenant Dale

29:07.582 --> 29:09.209
only uploaded a redacted document?

29:09.234 --> 29:10.662
Do you think taking some words out

29:10.687 --> 29:12.139
makes it okay to violate orders?

29:12.164 --> 29:15.084
GlobeSpill put those Rangers
in harm's way, not Dale.

29:15.109 --> 29:17.676
You know what happens when you
join the greatest fighting force

29:17.701 --> 29:19.401
the world has ever known?

29:19.703 --> 29:22.470
You make a commitment to discipline.

29:22.472 --> 29:24.844
If soldiers just start
going their own way,

29:24.869 --> 29:28.237
outside the chain of
command, people die.

29:28.945 --> 29:30.522
Now, that's not hyperbole.

29:30.547 --> 29:31.846
It's fact.

29:31.848 --> 29:34.857
And even if Tamsin didn't
reveal that Ranger unit,

29:34.882 --> 29:38.904
she created the conditions
that allowed someone else to.

29:39.764 --> 29:42.323
You're damned right I convened a trial.

29:42.975 --> 29:44.859
I have work to do, Doctor.

29:47.116 --> 29:49.283
How'd you lose the arm, Colonel?

29:50.003 --> 29:51.900
I didn't lose it, Doctor.

29:51.902 --> 29:54.472
I know exactly where it is.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.152
So, um, talked to Barnett.

29:59.177 --> 30:01.276
The judge gave a second
instruction to the members

30:01.278 --> 30:03.177
to disregard Benny's fireworks.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.780
And this is one jury that
knows how to follow orders.

30:05.782 --> 30:07.515
Maybe, but they heard it.

30:07.517 --> 30:10.366
And they saw Benny get
arrested to let them hear it.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.600
Well, what's Lieutenant
Dale gonna do without Benny?

30:12.625 --> 30:15.560
Give the closing argument? Me?

30:16.217 --> 30:18.393
The members want to hear from you.

30:18.824 --> 30:21.129
Walk them through what you
did. Start with the bombing.

30:21.131 --> 30:23.598
- Go.
- At 0530 on 1 December,

30:23.600 --> 30:25.676
a unit from the 28th Armored Brigade

30:25.701 --> 30:27.202
deployed a series of laser-guided bombs

30:27.204 --> 30:29.420
- together with Maverick missiles...
- No. No, no, no, stop.

30:29.444 --> 30:33.046
I ask you to tell me about
a traumatic car wreck,

30:33.071 --> 30:34.694
and you read me the accident report?

30:34.719 --> 30:37.189
- But it's what happened.
- It's the facts.

30:37.214 --> 30:38.947
I want the story.

30:40.183 --> 30:41.650
Why'd you report this colonel?

30:41.675 --> 30:42.884
He's a jerk. So what?

30:42.886 --> 30:45.511
- He was an ongoing threat...
- The story.

30:45.536 --> 30:48.378
Why do you care so much
about civilian casualties?

30:48.403 --> 30:51.698
- It affects our mission.
- The story, Lieutenant.

30:52.696 --> 30:54.828
You know what? Screw this.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.786
- And screw you.
- Hey.

30:57.383 --> 31:00.304
Every time you're under
stress, you look at this.

31:02.482 --> 31:04.148
Who's "M.L."?

31:05.836 --> 31:07.668
My friend Matt.

31:08.548 --> 31:10.415
He died in Yemen two years ago.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.910
Yemen.

31:13.382 --> 31:15.715
Matt was my best friend in high school.

31:15.929 --> 31:18.163
He was working for an NGO,

31:18.188 --> 31:20.333
trying to get children out.

31:20.848 --> 31:24.693
There was a bombing. The Saudis, not us.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.553
An accident.

31:28.554 --> 31:32.000
And no one cared about
civilian casualties.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.828
No one cared about Matt.

31:36.451 --> 31:38.551
And that's your story.

31:40.249 --> 31:44.151
15 kids died, plus Matt and many others.

31:44.176 --> 31:47.401
And everyone shrugged and just moved on.

31:47.426 --> 31:49.221
That's why the colonel's callousness

31:49.246 --> 31:51.079
was so jarring to me.

31:51.391 --> 31:54.225
We're the United States Damn Army.

31:54.524 --> 31:55.895
Aren't we better than that?

31:56.013 --> 31:58.950
Here are a few of my secrets.

31:59.390 --> 32:03.177
Words matter. Body language matters.

32:03.202 --> 32:06.711
Manolo and McNamara are
our most important jurors,

32:06.736 --> 32:09.763
which means eye contact.

32:10.207 --> 32:12.425
Engage with every word.

32:12.450 --> 32:15.495
Things were so black
and white to me then.

32:15.679 --> 32:17.479
Right and wrong.

32:17.504 --> 32:19.381
Colonel Kell was wrong,

32:19.382 --> 32:21.011
so I had to act.

32:21.036 --> 32:23.470
And the Army asked him to resign.

32:24.406 --> 32:25.890
Problem solved.

32:26.159 --> 32:27.324
Or so I thought.

32:27.349 --> 32:29.943
You need to punch the key words.

32:29.968 --> 32:32.992
Nothing is black and white.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.751
Nothing is black and white.

32:35.776 --> 32:38.296
I didn't know anything. I was a fool.

32:38.321 --> 32:40.989
I was trying to help the Army.

32:41.014 --> 32:42.702
But that's not good enough.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.494
I disobeyed orders indirectly.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.312
That was wrong.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.210
But know this.

32:49.412 --> 32:51.218
I am not a spy.

32:51.581 --> 32:54.585
I would never betray my country.

32:54.843 --> 32:57.018
I am a soldier.

32:59.655 --> 33:01.694
Thank you, McNamara.

33:02.192 --> 33:04.514
Jury started deliberations?

33:04.539 --> 33:06.072
Bull thinks we got two jurors...

33:06.097 --> 33:08.297
McNamara and Manolo.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.268
Just need two more.

33:13.847 --> 33:15.089
Cleaned up the firmware.

33:15.114 --> 33:17.011
Okay, good.

33:21.884 --> 33:24.551
The... the jury's still out.

33:25.857 --> 33:27.189
I know.

33:30.169 --> 33:31.440
Yeah?

33:32.115 --> 33:34.152
Okay. Thank you.

33:36.893 --> 33:38.488
They're back.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.007
Captain Lambert, your verdict.

33:45.335 --> 33:47.535
In the case of United States v. Dale,

33:47.560 --> 33:51.070
on the first specification
we find the accused...

33:52.052 --> 33:53.308
not guilty.

33:53.310 --> 33:54.876
On the second specification,

33:54.878 --> 33:58.046
we find the accused... not guilty.

33:58.048 --> 33:59.434
On the third specification,

33:59.459 --> 34:01.773
we find the accused... not guilty.

34:02.163 --> 34:04.118
And on the fourth specification,

34:04.120 --> 34:06.354
we find the accused... guilty.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.163
- On the specification...
- Tamsin.

34:09.165 --> 34:10.668
- Under Article 134...
- Hey.

34:10.670 --> 34:12.007
- Unauthorized taking...
- It's...

34:12.032 --> 34:14.335
- of national defense information,
- guilty.

34:14.712 --> 34:16.141
- The accused is found guilty.
- Wow.

34:16.165 --> 34:18.382
Sentencing to begin
first thing tomorrow.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.090
Bad break.

34:29.646 --> 34:31.512
- The verdict.
- Benny was the bad break.

34:31.514 --> 34:33.605
This is just...

34:33.630 --> 34:35.308
mission failure.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.949
- How much time you think she'll get?
- 20.

34:38.621 --> 34:40.420
Ten if she's lucky.

34:40.447 --> 34:43.012
It's up to the jury now.

34:48.831 --> 34:50.360
Tell Danny I need everything she's got

34:50.386 --> 34:52.496
on Colonel Abernathy Jackson.

35:06.664 --> 35:08.374
Can I help you, Dr. Bull?

35:08.399 --> 35:11.133
There was this officer in 2006.

35:11.158 --> 35:15.494
Deployed with the 141st
Infantry Brigade in Kabul.

35:15.706 --> 35:18.840
Forward operating base,
lots of civilian contact.

35:18.842 --> 35:20.898
The unit came under fire,

35:20.923 --> 35:23.476
and a private left behind some ordnance.

35:23.501 --> 35:26.773
Kids were known to play in
the area, so this officer...

35:26.798 --> 35:29.365
went back for it. Without permission.

35:29.493 --> 35:33.077
And on his way back, he hit an IED,

35:33.609 --> 35:35.460
and it took off his hand.

35:35.485 --> 35:36.951
I may have heard this one.

35:36.976 --> 35:39.741
Another soldier's mistake
put the mission at risk.

35:39.766 --> 35:41.232
You fixed it

35:41.765 --> 35:44.363
and got a Bronze Star in the process.

35:44.388 --> 35:46.926
You think that's like
what the lieutenant did.

35:46.951 --> 35:49.426
Well, the question is,

35:50.045 --> 35:51.699
what do you think?

35:54.819 --> 35:56.756
Lieutenant Dale having been found guilty

35:56.781 --> 35:58.147
of one specification,

35:58.172 --> 36:00.647
the members will now pronounce sentence.

36:01.896 --> 36:03.865
First Lieutenant Tamsin
Dale is hereby sentenced

36:03.890 --> 36:05.502
to 12 years confinement,

36:05.527 --> 36:07.661
forfeiture of all pay and allowances,

36:07.686 --> 36:09.432
and dismissal from the service.

36:09.457 --> 36:10.932
Thank you, members of the panel.

36:10.957 --> 36:13.721
Sentence of 12 years to
be served at Leavenworth.

36:13.868 --> 36:17.002
You will be granted credit
for pre-trial confinement.

36:18.307 --> 36:21.104
Your Honor, I respectfully ask

36:21.129 --> 36:23.510
the convening authority to weigh in.

36:23.550 --> 36:27.330
He has the prerogative under the UCMJ.

36:27.406 --> 36:29.174
Colonel Jackson?

36:37.071 --> 36:39.335
Lieutenant Tamsin Dale's actions

36:39.360 --> 36:41.468
make me sick to my stomach.

36:41.493 --> 36:44.327
The arrogance. The selfishness.

36:44.352 --> 36:45.884
The carelessness.

36:45.909 --> 36:48.829
This is a young woman
who had so much promise.

36:48.854 --> 36:51.889
And she threw it away because
she thought her opinions

36:51.914 --> 36:54.236
were more important than the rules.

36:54.261 --> 36:57.181
That her humanity trumped her duty.

36:58.903 --> 37:00.415
But...

37:00.510 --> 37:04.479
to remain the greatest force for
good this nation has ever known,

37:04.504 --> 37:07.034
the Army must study its mistakes.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.104
And if we hide our mistakes

37:09.129 --> 37:11.697
and punish the people who expose them,

37:11.722 --> 37:13.221
we won't.

37:15.643 --> 37:17.192
Lieutenant Dale,

37:17.194 --> 37:18.596
as convening authority,

37:18.621 --> 37:20.721
I am altering your sentence.

37:20.964 --> 37:23.307
You will be dismissed from the Army,

37:23.332 --> 37:25.955
but your confinement will
be limited to one year,

37:25.980 --> 37:28.147
served here, on base.

37:30.963 --> 37:32.650
Thank you, Colonel.

37:33.131 --> 37:35.377
This court-martial is concluded.

37:35.508 --> 37:37.346
Court is adjourned.

37:40.783 --> 37:42.908
Maybe what you do,

37:43.227 --> 37:45.799
maybe lying for a living is...

37:45.824 --> 37:47.328
a little strong.

37:47.353 --> 37:48.786
Maybe.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.180
Your story's gonna be...

37:52.205 --> 37:54.939
different from here on out.

37:54.964 --> 37:57.197
I signed up to serve my country.

37:57.321 --> 37:59.889
Turns out this is how
I'm going to do it.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.860
Thank you.

38:04.253 --> 38:05.972
Be well, Lieutenant.

38:10.344 --> 38:12.128
Danny's right.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.457
You're pretty good.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.605
Special Agent,

38:18.589 --> 38:21.022
I have a proposal for you.

38:22.791 --> 38:24.877
- He's back!
- Hey, guys.

38:24.902 --> 38:27.202
Hey.

38:28.064 --> 38:30.885
- The FBI took the deal?
- What deal?

38:30.910 --> 38:32.419
The FBI wants to get GlobeSpill,

38:32.444 --> 38:33.636
we gave 'em GlobeSpill's worm.

38:33.660 --> 38:35.666
We traded Benny for the hackers' code.

38:35.691 --> 38:38.008
The FBI is gonna bludgeon
GlobeSpill with it at trial.

38:38.033 --> 38:39.466
All charges dropped.

38:39.491 --> 38:40.991
It was Bull's idea.

38:42.079 --> 38:43.274
Where is he?

38:57.224 --> 38:59.524
You didn't come to
the FBI for my release.

38:59.549 --> 39:01.716
Well, I didn't think
you'd want me there.

39:04.367 --> 39:05.800
I do trust you.

39:05.825 --> 39:07.595
You kept things from me.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.470
Important things.

39:14.343 --> 39:17.055
My half sister ran away when
I was around eight years old.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.347
Well, she tried to run away.

39:20.184 --> 39:22.359
My father was gone that time.

39:22.384 --> 39:24.250
My stepmother was taking care of us.

39:24.275 --> 39:25.883
If you want to call it that.

39:25.908 --> 39:27.507
You have a half sister.

39:28.297 --> 39:30.703
Sarah came back before supper.

39:30.728 --> 39:33.162
Her bike had gotten a flat tire.

39:33.187 --> 39:35.954
And she begged me not to tell.

39:35.979 --> 39:37.502
You didn't keep the secret.

39:37.527 --> 39:39.460
I told my best friend.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.315
Kenny.

39:41.364 --> 39:44.499
He told his father, and his
father told my stepmother.

39:46.049 --> 39:48.135
And then your stepmother punished her.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.057
Sometimes a secret has to be kept.

39:54.867 --> 39:56.433
I didn't need your protection in court.

39:56.458 --> 39:57.734
I know.

40:03.271 --> 40:06.382
If I had to do it again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

40:21.246 --> 40:23.059
Hey.

40:23.061 --> 40:24.723
You're Benny Colon, right?

40:24.748 --> 40:27.637
Yeah. The receptionist just left.

40:27.662 --> 40:29.793
- You can come back tomorrow, okay?
- No need.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.587
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Hold on, hold on.

40:32.589 --> 40:35.848
United States Attorney's Office,
Public Corruption Unit? What?

40:35.873 --> 40:37.337
Am I under investigation?

40:37.362 --> 40:38.988
How would I know?

40:40.864 --> 40:43.059
Go home already.

40:43.084 --> 40:45.910
Hey. Is everything okay?

40:45.935 --> 40:47.316
Fine.

40:47.341 --> 40:48.807
Everything's fine.

40:51.627 --> 40:53.942
Good night.
