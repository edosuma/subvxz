WEBVTT

00:18.542 --> 00:20.083
ELIJAH: I don't understand why
you would wanna leave New York.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.500
What are you gonna do?
Teach? Write? Live in a house?

00:23.500 --> 00:25.542
I mean, literally all three
of those things.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.625
HANNAH: You had a party,
and you didn't invite me?

00:28.625 --> 00:30.792
You're having a baby,
and you neglected to tell me

00:30.792 --> 00:32.417
after you literally told
everyone else.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.000
MARNIE: Shosh is engaged.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.083
I can see that.

00:35.542 --> 00:37.000
I didn't even know
she was dating anyone.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.583
Group meeting, in the bathroom.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.542
Yes, Shosh.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.291
This is the reason that we
can't hang out together anymore.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.458
I think we should all
just agree to call it.

00:45.625 --> 00:48.125
I'm sorry. For everything.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.291
-I don't really...
-I mean, think about it.

00:50.291 --> 00:52.458
Like, we were all
just doing our best. So...

00:52.458 --> 00:53.875
Our best was awful.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.333
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:04.375 --> 01:06.333
( music playing )

01:24.083 --> 01:25.458
What the fuck?!

01:25.458 --> 01:27.667
Marnie, what the fuck?
When did you get here?

01:27.667 --> 01:28.792
Like, 1:00 AM.

01:28.792 --> 01:31.125
You were just asleep
for, like, 13 hours.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.333
How did you get in?

01:32.333 --> 01:33.625
If you think your
country windows

01:33.625 --> 01:35.291
are secure downstairs,
think again.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.708
What are you doing here?

01:36.708 --> 01:38.667
I would like to help you
raise your baby.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.166
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.834
You're about to go through
an incredibly intense,

01:43.834 --> 01:48.041
emotional, tough,
but miraculous transition.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.250
And I would like
to be here to help
and support you.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.667
Well, this is
just like Adam's pitch

01:52.667 --> 01:54.000
and that didn't work out
so great, so.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.375
No, no, no.
But see, it's not,

01:55.375 --> 01:57.500
because I can admit
that I don't have, like,

01:57.500 --> 01:59.208
a lot of other
things going on.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.583
Currently living
in my mom's home gym...

02:00.583 --> 02:02.333
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and my band broke up.

02:02.333 --> 02:05.458
But the thing is,
I still have a lot
to give, a lot.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.917
So, why not give it to you
and this little angel?

02:08.917 --> 02:11.708
I don't know, Marnie,
this is just...

02:11.708 --> 02:13.208
You think you have
a lot of friends, right?

02:14.750 --> 02:16.250
- Yeah.
- Who's here?

02:16.250 --> 02:17.375
Depends on the day.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.750
Elijah's not here.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.417
Jessa sure as hell
isn't here.

02:21.417 --> 02:22.750
Adam isn't here.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.500
Shoshanna literally
despises all of us.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
Who's here?

02:27.500 --> 02:29.792
I'm here.

02:29.792 --> 02:31.166
I win.

02:31.166 --> 02:32.875
I'm your best friend.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.041
I'm the best
at being your friend.

02:35.041 --> 02:37.750
I love you the most.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.750
Okay.

02:40.750 --> 02:41.834
Yeah?

02:44.208 --> 02:45.250
Yeah, okay.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.166
Fuck, yeah!

02:48.166 --> 02:49.750
( music playing )

02:51.166 --> 02:53.750
( baby crying )

02:55.291 --> 02:57.708
( cooing )

02:57.708 --> 03:00.750
Hannah:
Are you sure this isn't
too cold for him?

03:00.750 --> 03:03.625
- It's okay, Grovey, it's okay.
- No, he's just fine.

03:03.625 --> 03:06.583
Okay, and you disinfect
the scale between babies,
right?

03:06.583 --> 03:08.333
Okay, 13 pounds.
That's a nice size.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.417
- He's a nice size.
- You're a nice size.

03:11.417 --> 03:15.083
Okay, but he was
closer to 10 when he was born,
so I'm just a little confused.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.750
Babies will often lose
10% of their birth weight
in the first few weeks.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.291
- It's nothing
to be concerned about.
- ( Grover crying )

03:19.291 --> 03:21.000
As long as he's
feeding normally.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.542
Oh, no, he's eating.
He's eating all the time.

03:23.542 --> 03:25.834
- Breast milk or formula?
- It's okay.

03:25.834 --> 03:28.542
Is there a chance we could
talk to Dr. Monoghan?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.542
She's on vacation right now,
looking at a waterfall
with her family

03:30.542 --> 03:32.667
and I'm not calling her.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.083
It's just, like,
she knows our whole story
and she's met Grover...

03:35.083 --> 03:37.250
Would you want
to be disturbed
on your family vacation?

03:37.250 --> 03:38.959
Well, just depends
on priorities.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.792
Like, I write through
my whole vacation.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.125
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.625
He breastfed
for six weeks,

03:43.625 --> 03:46.291
- then he just, like, stopped.
- Are you pumping?

03:46.291 --> 03:49.250
Oh, my God, yeah,
I'm pumping so much.
I'm like a saucer machine.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.208
He just-- he will only
take it from the bottle.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.583
Well, so long
as he's getting it.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.291
But isn't there, like,
an issue with bonding?

03:54.291 --> 03:55.625
Like, isn't it
important?

03:55.625 --> 03:56.959
- Shh.
- All right, listen.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.959
Breastfeeding
is mysterious.

03:58.959 --> 04:00.458
Sometimes
it's a piece of cake.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.125
And sometimes,
there's something,

04:02.125 --> 04:04.375
the chemistry, the fit--
it's just off.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.500
Okay.

04:08.417 --> 04:11.667
Um, well,
I guess that's it.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.750
Um, if you have
any lollipops?

04:14.750 --> 04:16.708
( baby crying )

04:19.125 --> 04:20.708
Hey.

04:20.708 --> 04:23.500
- Hi, how did it go?
- It was fine.
It was good.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.083
I mean, they said he's
basically the perfect
weight, so.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.583
You are?
That's so great!

04:27.583 --> 04:30.875
That's, like, the greatest
compliment a person can get.

04:30.875 --> 04:34.166
Hi, baby.
What did he say
about breast feeding?

04:34.166 --> 04:36.291
I mean, I don't trust that,
like, temp doctor.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.834
Yeah, everyone here
looks pretty fucking
formula-fed to me.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.083
Aunt Marnie's here.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.959
Aunt Marnie's here.
( kisses )

04:44.959 --> 04:47.834
Hannah: He just made it sound
like some babies never
get the hang of it.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.750
But you told him
you've been pumping, right?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.291
Yes, I told him
I've been pumping,

04:51.291 --> 04:53.208
and I said I don't know
how much longer I can do it.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.208
I was like,
"My nipples hurt.
They feel like iguana skin."

04:56.208 --> 05:00.250
What am I gonna do
when I start my job next month,
like, tote a breast pump around?

05:00.250 --> 05:01.750
What if there's a student
I want to fuck?

05:01.750 --> 05:03.542
Promise me you're not
gonna give up, okay?

05:03.542 --> 05:05.750
There's a reason
they call breast milk
liquid gold.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.500
Well, if you really
felt like that, I think you
would agree to taste mine, so.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.542
Hannah, you have to stop
asking me to do that.

05:10.542 --> 05:13.291
It's nice, it's like
hemp milk or something.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.417
Babies that are breastfed
are less likely to get sick
when they're little.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.708
And also, they show
higher cognitive function
at an earlier age.

05:19.708 --> 05:23.166
And I just saw a study
that says that they snag
higher-paying jobs.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.166
- What about that
doesn't sound great?
- Well, I was never breastfed

05:26.166 --> 05:28.041
and I'm a dream
and a ray of sunshine, so.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.917
That's exactly
my point.

05:29.917 --> 05:31.959
I was breastfed
for two years.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.375
Great, it seems like
it worked out super great
for you.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.542
It did.

( Grover crying )

06:33.959 --> 06:36.208
Sorry.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.625
( car approaching )

06:38.625 --> 06:40.625
( birds chirping )

06:48.875 --> 06:50.291
Hey, little man.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.000
Listen,
I'm really sorry
about before.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.333
I really don't
want to talk about it.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.750
Yeah, but we should
talk about it.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.583
You yelled at me
for loving music.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.834
There's honestly
nothing to talk about.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.625
( train horn blaring
in distance )

07:10.917 --> 07:13.000
I love that
you love music.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.667
Come on, Grover.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.166
Come on!

07:19.166 --> 07:20.834
It's good.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.834
There's a businessman
who'd pay a lot of money
to do this.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.500
- ( crying )
- No, look, it's right here.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.250
You don't have to cry
'cause it's right here.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.917
- ( squealing )
- No!

07:28.917 --> 07:31.583
You think you're
the first man who
rejected this?

07:31.583 --> 07:34.208
Well, think again,
you're not being
very original.

07:34.208 --> 07:37.250
You know what,
you're being kind of
a fuckhead.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.708
You're being kind of
a little bit of an asshole.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.917
I don't know
what to say to you.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.417
- ( crying )
- ( exhales )

07:46.708 --> 07:48.417
- ( sneezes )
- Bless you.

07:57.375 --> 08:00.000
And that is a swaddle.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.542
- ( cooing )
- Yeah. Yeah. Really good.

08:02.542 --> 08:04.708
- Baby. Yeah.
- Uh...

08:04.708 --> 08:08.166
- ( Grover crying )
- No, actually, here.
You can do it like this.

08:10.667 --> 08:14.208
Okay, here. Hi.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.250
- Hi, favorite boy!
- ( crying stops )

08:16.250 --> 08:17.875
Hello.

08:19.125 --> 08:22.959
Hi! Oh, my little
baby burrito.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.750
Oh.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.583
That's another way
to do it.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.708
Yeah.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.625
( crying )

08:34.582 --> 08:37.457
( sighs )
Are you making an envelope
with your nipple, Hannah?

08:37.457 --> 08:38.750
Are you making an envelope
with your nipple?

08:38.750 --> 08:40.332
Do you even
have a nipple?

08:40.332 --> 08:42.082
'Cause I've known you
a long time

08:42.082 --> 08:43.750
and I actually
don't think I've seen it.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.542
How the fuck do you make
an envelope with your nipple?

08:45.542 --> 08:46.792
Anyway, it's pronounced
"enn-velope."

08:46.792 --> 08:48.542
Just, like,
don't be so pretentious.

08:48.542 --> 08:53.000
So, apparently,
you just fold it down
from the base of the areola,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.583
and then rather than pushing
his face onto the breast,

08:56.583 --> 09:00.166
just squeeze a little bit
of milk out onto the tip
of the nipple,

09:00.166 --> 09:04.291
brush his lips across
the nipple so that he
decides to take it.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.208
Okay, I need this
to stop.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.625
Because, A--
it's fucking revolting,

09:08.625 --> 09:11.041
and B-- every time
you say nipple,
a fairy dies.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.959
Hannah, do not get stressed,
especially when you're
holding Grover.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.458
He can sense it.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.458
Cortisol and a million other
super powerful hormones

09:17.458 --> 09:19.208
just flow through
your body.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.625
Somehow, you've just
gotta stay centered.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.708
Clear your head.
Stay present.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.458
This is a sacred time.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.625
So, now it's my fault?

09:26.625 --> 09:28.667
Like, my stress
is repelling him?

09:28.667 --> 09:30.959
Listen, he's hungry,
let's just give him a bottle

09:30.959 --> 09:32.542
and then he'll, like,
torture animals

09:32.542 --> 09:34.041
and keep a room
like in the movie "Room."

09:34.041 --> 09:35.125
I don't care.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.458
I think your
sense of humor

09:37.458 --> 09:40.667
could be a very powerful tool
during this journey.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.542
- ( crying )
- Don't worry, Hannah.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.125
- Shh.
- He's gonna latch.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.792
He did it
for a whole month.

09:47.792 --> 09:50.125
He just forgot
what was good for him.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.792
- Didn't you, Grovito?
- You know what?

09:52.792 --> 09:54.417
Your, like, desire
to be part of this

09:54.417 --> 09:56.417
is actually starting
to feel really perverse.

09:56.417 --> 10:00.208
I feel, like, very objectified
and I just would like
some privacy.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.500
Oh, it says
if you need assistance,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.041
you might ask someone
to help press

10:04.041 --> 10:06.500
by placing her fingers
or thumbs on top of yours.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.166
- Do you want me
to come help?
- No.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.333
Nope.
Nope, I don't.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.375
( crickets chirping )

10:14.375 --> 10:16.041
( TV playing )

10:17.834 --> 10:21.166
Hello, Information?
I need to talk to Mr. Boat.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.542
( laughs )

10:22.542 --> 10:26.834
John Stamos
has not aged
a single day.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.583
It's insane.
And, like, why is
this man a bachelor?

10:30.708 --> 10:33.125
Hello?

10:33.125 --> 10:34.166
How rude.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.834
The question is, like,
could the Olsen twins

10:38.834 --> 10:40.625
have become fashion moguls
without "Full House,"

10:40.625 --> 10:42.708
or like, is it
what catapulted them?

10:44.375 --> 10:45.708
So, I've been thinking

10:45.708 --> 10:48.834
and I might wanna
go out tomorrow night.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.917
There's a wine bar
in Tivoli.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.291
I looked it up,
and there's gonna be, like,

10:53.291 --> 10:55.500
a live jazz trio playing.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.959
- A live jazz trio?
- Yeah, live.

10:57.959 --> 11:00.375
Marnie, that's the most
disgusting thing
I've ever heard.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.875
The only thing grosser
than a jazz trio would be,
like, a jazz quadrangle.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.667
This is empty,
by they way.

11:11.333 --> 11:15.375
There's gonna be, like,
a flight of local cheeses,

11:15.375 --> 11:18.041
and-- and then there's
gonna be this, like,

11:18.041 --> 11:20.959
awesome
Sonoma wine pairing.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.250
And you learn
about wine, and...

11:24.959 --> 11:26.625
Yeah,
but there'd be, like,

11:26.625 --> 11:29.000
no way I could
come with you.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.583
No, yeah,
just I would go.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.959
So, I would just, like,
stay here with Grover
all night by myself?

11:37.917 --> 11:40.959
Never mind.
I'll just go another time.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.375
Well, is it like,
a weekly thing?

11:42.375 --> 11:44.125
Like, if it happens,
like, next week--

11:44.125 --> 11:45.250
I don't know, Hannah.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.083
If you really want cheese,
we can buy cheese

11:49.083 --> 11:50.500
and, like, put on jazz.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.500
I just-- we don't
have to go to a place.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.125
- ♪ Now my mascara runnin',
red lipstick smudged... ♪
- ( shutter clicking )

11:56.125 --> 11:58.750
♪ Oh, he so horny,
yeah, he want to fuck ♪

11:58.750 --> 12:01.625
♪ He popped all my buttons
and he ripped my blouse ♪

12:01.625 --> 12:04.083
♪ He Monica-Lewinski'd

12:04.083 --> 12:06.708
♪ Whoa, there, Daddy,
Daddy didn't bring

12:06.708 --> 12:08.750
- ( thuds )
- ( Grover crying )

12:08.750 --> 12:11.458
He hates me.
I don't know what to say.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.792
I don't know
what I did to him

12:12.792 --> 12:15.625
besides grow him in my body
for nine months.

12:15.625 --> 12:16.667
But he hates me.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.083
The guy
at the ShopRite

12:18.083 --> 12:19.750
is more interested
in my boobs than he is.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.125
So, why don't you
just swaddle him,
give him a bottle.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.917
There's nothing I can even
do for him anymore.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.917
I don't know what to say.
He hates me.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.625
- I can't do anything.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.792
- ( crying continues )
- Come here. Come here.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.375
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.917
Shh, shh, shh.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.583
( trilling )

12:35.583 --> 12:37.500
( coos )

12:38.834 --> 12:40.792
( birds chirping )

12:42.500 --> 12:44.208
( Grover crying )

12:44.208 --> 12:48.291
Loreen:
Hey, it's almost 11:00 AM.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.041
( crying continues )

12:54.041 --> 12:57.291
Are you awake now,
Hannah?!

12:57.291 --> 12:59.500
Oh, good morning.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.291
Grover's been awake
for almost three hours.

13:06.542 --> 13:07.750
( groans )

13:07.750 --> 13:10.750
Ooh. Sweetie,
you're leaking.

13:10.750 --> 13:14.041
♪ Little man,
little man. ♪

13:14.041 --> 13:16.250
- You called my mom?
- Yeah, I did.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.875
You called my mother
and you told her
to come here.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.917
Yeah, Hannah.
You're having
a really hard time

13:20.917 --> 13:23.542
and I just thought
it would be helpful
for you to have her.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.542
Well, it's not helpful.
Remember last time?

13:25.542 --> 13:29.375
All she did was complain
about how unfair the judging
process on "The Voice" is.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.291
She's not helpful.
She makes things
harder for me.

13:32.291 --> 13:34.625
Okay, well, then, I didn't
call her here for you.

13:34.625 --> 13:36.375
I called her here
for me.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.959
I wanted some help.
This is above my pay grade.

13:38.959 --> 13:41.375
I'm doing my best.
I'm reading all the books.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.583
But honestly,
it's too much.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.708
And you're not even
acting that mature!

13:45.708 --> 13:47.375
You begged
to come here.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.041
You wanted to
be here with me
and help me.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.542
And now it's not matching up
to what you imagined,

13:52.542 --> 13:54.708
which was, like,
that it would be
a "Laura Ashley" catalogue.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.917
Or, like, a fun,
zany sitcom

13:56.917 --> 13:59.333
starring Brittany Snow
and the rest of the cast
of "Pitch Perfect,"

13:59.333 --> 14:01.542
just carrying
a cute, little baby.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.917
- ( crying )
- Okay, I'm sorry
we didn't make any jam.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.208
I'm sorry you didn't meet,
like, a hot woodworker.

14:06.208 --> 14:09.041
But this is reality.
It's happening now.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.208
And you suck at it,
okay?

14:11.208 --> 14:13.000
You're doing a bad job,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.917
and the reason you are is
'cause you're the immature one,

14:15.917 --> 14:17.750
so check that out!

14:17.750 --> 14:19.375
All right,
Ghostbuster.

14:21.417 --> 14:24.458
- ( crying )
- What?

14:24.458 --> 14:27.250
( water sloshing )

14:27.250 --> 14:29.166
I don't know
when my vagina
and my butthole

14:29.166 --> 14:31.375
are gonna start to feel
like two separate
entities again,

14:31.375 --> 14:33.125
but I'm really
looking forward to that.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.917
Loreen:
Honey, this will
all be over soon.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.458
It'll be like a blip.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.667
Things will get
so much harder,

14:37.667 --> 14:39.208
you won't even
remember this part.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.792
God,
I hope you're right.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.917
Listen, Hannah,
when I had you,
I couldn't breast feed.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.250
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't get you to latch on.

14:47.250 --> 14:52.041
And my nipples both inverted
and it hurt like fire
in my tits.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.458
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.417
Obviously, your father
was no help at all.

14:56.417 --> 15:00.542
- He was scared enough
of breasts as is.
- ( chuckles )

15:00.542 --> 15:04.000
And all these women
in my campus mothering circle

15:04.000 --> 15:06.166
were so judgmental.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.625
It was the 80s,
you know.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.625
All these cunts
in linen pants

15:09.625 --> 15:12.375
who were so pleased
not to be using formula.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.291
I mean,
I was raised on formula.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.291
Nice post-war formula.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.750
What's the fucking problem?
You turned out fine.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.000
Yeah, but don't you get it?
I don't want him to
turn out fine.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.291
I want him to
turn out better than fine.
He's so beautiful.

15:23.291 --> 15:26.291
- He's so much more
beautiful than me.
- He really is.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.250
But honey, he'll be fine,
whether you use formula
or milk,

15:29.250 --> 15:31.333
- or, you know--
- Mom, don't you get it?

15:31.333 --> 15:32.834
I'm mentally ill,

15:32.834 --> 15:34.792
I'm overweight,

15:34.792 --> 15:36.417
I isolate people,

15:36.417 --> 15:38.125
I'm a quitter.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.417
So, what if that's
the kind of man
that I raise?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.667
What if that's the only
kind of man I can raise?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.667
- That's not gonna happen.
- ( sighs )

15:45.667 --> 15:48.834
And I'm still
fucking bleeding.

15:48.834 --> 15:51.000
From my vagina.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.333
No one understands!

15:53.333 --> 15:55.959
You think no one
understands you?

15:55.959 --> 15:57.291
Yeah, I do,

15:57.291 --> 15:59.625
because I made
a very intense choice

15:59.625 --> 16:02.834
to take this on
all by myself, okay?

16:02.834 --> 16:06.208
I decided to be brave
and just go it alone--

16:06.208 --> 16:09.542
Mom, I buckle my bra
every day, okay?

16:09.542 --> 16:12.500
But just do it
for a second.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.375
You know?
And now it's like
I can't even do

16:14.375 --> 16:18.333
the most natural
human process on earth
of feeding my child?

16:18.333 --> 16:20.458
And Marnie acted like
she was here to help me,

16:20.458 --> 16:22.291
and now all she does--
that's fine.

16:22.291 --> 16:26.041
And now all she does is
judge me and bully me,
you know?

16:26.041 --> 16:27.333
But she wouldn't
if she knew what it was like

16:27.333 --> 16:29.375
to be rejected
by your own child

16:29.375 --> 16:32.291
like you've been rejected
by every other fucking man
in your life.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.875
'Cause let's face it,
Grover fucking hates me.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.875
You really
upset Marnie, you know?

16:36.875 --> 16:38.291
She called me
weeping.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.917
I got on a plane
at 5:00 AM.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.333
- I upset Marnie?
- Yeah.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.667
Well, maybe she should have
thought a little

16:43.667 --> 16:45.500
before she came out here
to help,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.583
considering
that things might get
pretty fucking intense.

16:47.583 --> 16:48.917
'Cause you know
what, Mom?

16:48.917 --> 16:51.542
I tend to get
pretty fucking intense.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.208
Yeah, well,
maybe she thought

16:53.208 --> 16:55.250
you'd act
like a fucking grown-up.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.750
- What?
- You want to act like this
whole thing was an accident?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.333
Like it happened to you?
That's fine, Hannah.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.041
But that's not honest.

17:02.041 --> 17:04.625
You made a choice
to have this child,
and guess what?

17:04.625 --> 17:06.375
It's the first one
you can't take back.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.416
You can't get
your tuition refunded.

17:08.416 --> 17:09.750
You can't
break the lease.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.666
You can't delete
his phone number.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.458
Your son
is not a temp job.

17:13.458 --> 17:14.916
He's not Adam.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.541
This is it, honey,
and this is forever.

17:17.541 --> 17:19.208
Stop following me!

17:19.208 --> 17:21.458
And why are you judging me
and putting words in my mouth?

17:21.458 --> 17:24.791
- Why are you judging me?
- Because you just said
your baby hates you,

17:24.791 --> 17:27.666
and that is the most moronic
thing I have ever heard.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.125
He doesn't hate you.
He doesn't hate anybody.

17:30.125 --> 17:33.583
He's a goddamn baby,
and you are all he has.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.750
I don't understand
why you're yelling at me

17:35.750 --> 17:37.417
when I'm
in emotional pain.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.667
Yeah, well,
you know who else
is in emotional pain?

17:39.667 --> 17:41.625
- Who?
- Fucking everyone!

17:41.625 --> 17:43.875
For their whole lives!

17:43.875 --> 17:45.542
Nobody said
this was gonna be easy.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.333
Nobody guaranteed
this would be fun.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.792
You didn't sign
a contract in the womb

17:49.792 --> 17:52.041
saying you were headed
for Six Flags.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.667
- What are you making?
- Bisquick, obviously,

17:54.667 --> 17:57.834
'cause you have to add, like,
2,000 calories a day to your
diet if you're breast feeding

17:57.834 --> 18:00.166
- to do it successfully.
- Hannah.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.000
( stammering )
Hah!

18:02.000 --> 18:05.333
I don't understand, Mom.
You didn't say it was
gonna be this hard.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.458
Oh, have I made this
look easy to you?

18:07.458 --> 18:12.166
No. Have the last few years
looked easy to you?

18:12.166 --> 18:14.250
Maybe they would have
if you'd chosen a husband

18:14.250 --> 18:16.750
who wasn't gay
and who actually loved you.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.625
And then I would know what,
like, a normal, functional
family looked like,

18:19.625 --> 18:22.750
and I wouldn't
be up here with Marnie
acting like that was normal.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.000
You know?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.458
And this house
would be a home

18:25.458 --> 18:28.041
and not just
a fucking bunch of rooms.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.500
So, thank you.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.250
No, thank you, Hannah.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.667
- Thank you
so much for that.
- ( door opens )

18:33.917 --> 18:36.166
- Thanks, baby girl.
- Ow!

18:40.750 --> 18:42.750
Oh, man.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.959
( birds chirping )

18:52.834 --> 18:54.375
Hey, are you okay?

18:55.792 --> 18:57.750
I'm not a hooker.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.542
No one said you were.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.959
Sorry
for trying to help.

19:02.959 --> 19:06.500
God fucking damn it.
Men are disgusting.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.041
- Am I English? No?
- Marnie: No, just me.
You're a pilot.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.875
- ( mechanical buzzing )
- All right, I'm a pilot, yeah.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.375
We're, um--
we're just

19:15.375 --> 19:18.959
- approaching
cruising altitude.
- Yeah.

19:18.959 --> 19:22.667
Is, uh-- is everything
okay back there, Shelly?

19:22.667 --> 19:25.125
( imitates British accent )
Yes, except...

19:25.125 --> 19:28.750
there's been a slight
disturbance in the cabin.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.333
Yes, I noticed that
someone was ringing

19:31.333 --> 19:34.041
the, uh--
the assistance button.

19:34.041 --> 19:38.417
Yes, 11-C has a problem
with his-- his dick.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.166
- ( buzzing continues )
- Oh.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.708
Should I go help him
with his dick?

19:42.708 --> 19:44.792
- He's in 11-C.
- Yes.

19:44.792 --> 19:48.875
I think you should probably
go back there and make sure
he's all right.

19:48.875 --> 19:53.000
Yes, do you think I should
use the oxygen mask
on his dick?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.166
Yeah, I think--
I think you should,

19:55.166 --> 19:58.125
and I think you should
put it on him first

19:58.125 --> 20:00.500
before helping
others around him out.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.166
Marnie, I think
we're out of breast milk.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.792
Yes, I've already
told him that.

20:03.792 --> 20:07.041
- Shelly?
- Excuse me.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.917
( labored breathing )
Shelly,

20:08.917 --> 20:11.125
- this is your captain
speaking.
- Oh, fuck.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.959
- ( imitates British accent )
I'll be right there.
- Okay.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.458
Damn it.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.250
Oh, I used the last bag
of breast milk earlier.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.625
So, we'll just have to wait
till Hannah gets back.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.208
Ugh.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.500
I have no idea
when she'll be back.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.125
- Yeah.
- Motherhood
seems to have had

20:36.125 --> 20:38.041
such an effect on her.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.166
Yeah, I don't even know
why we have that here.

20:41.166 --> 20:44.917
Sorry I walked in
on you beating off.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.625
( chuckles )
No, you didn't.

20:48.125 --> 20:51.458
Masturbating.
Did I not catch you
touching yourself?

20:51.458 --> 20:55.000
No, you did not
catch me touching myself.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.166
Okay, Marnie, sure,

20:57.166 --> 20:58.708
but, you know,
I live alone.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.500
I ain't judging.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.208
No, no, no, no.
It's just, it's not
masturbating

21:03.208 --> 21:05.625
if you are video chatting
with someone.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.583
Who is he?

21:08.583 --> 21:10.083
( clicks tongue )

21:10.083 --> 21:13.667
His name is Delvin,
Delvin P.

21:13.667 --> 21:17.125
He's from Weehawken,
and he's a very nice
personal trainer.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.458
( chuckles )

21:20.291 --> 21:22.542
Hey.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.291
Are you happy here?

21:24.291 --> 21:26.125
With Hannah
and Grover?

21:28.500 --> 21:30.125
I mean, yeah, sure.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.875
I don't need
to be happy.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.208
Why?

21:35.208 --> 21:37.625
It's just not my time.
This is important.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.750
Hannah's
my best friend.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.500
Has it ever
occurred to you

21:42.500 --> 21:44.834
that the best thing
for you and your friendship

21:44.834 --> 21:46.750
would be if you
were happy, too?

21:46.750 --> 21:49.750
Hannah and Grover can't
do this by themselves.
They need me.

21:51.291 --> 21:54.708
Listen, I spent 30 years
supporting my best friend.

21:54.708 --> 21:57.875
You know?
We even had
a child together.

21:57.875 --> 22:00.417
But mostly, we just got
angrier and angrier

22:00.417 --> 22:02.458
until all that was left
was hate.

22:02.458 --> 22:04.667
I hate
my best friend now.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.417
And all because
I didn't know how
to let him go.

22:10.708 --> 22:12.333
( exhales )

22:15.458 --> 22:17.959
You know,
these ingredients
aren't even that bad.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.959
( crickets chirping )

22:22.959 --> 22:24.125
( dog barks )

22:30.375 --> 22:31.834
( door slams )

22:31.834 --> 22:34.000
Girl:
You're a fucking monster!

22:34.000 --> 22:36.041
( crying )

22:44.875 --> 22:46.375
Hey!

22:46.375 --> 22:50.750
- Are you okay?
- Like, clearly no.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.917
Okay, you can talk to me,
it's okay.

22:52.917 --> 22:55.208
I'm safe.
I'm a safe person.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.917
Do you have
a phone, ma'am?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.625
- Ma'am?
- ( crying )

22:58.625 --> 23:01.250
No, I'm sorry.
I don't have a cell phone
on me right now.

23:01.250 --> 23:04.125
Well, then,
what makes you a--
a safe person?

23:04.125 --> 23:06.291
I don't know.
Look at me, I just am.

23:06.291 --> 23:08.250
What-- what happened?

23:08.250 --> 23:11.125
I ran away
as fast as I could.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.125
It was an emergency
incident.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.834
Okay, you cannot be out here
without any shoes or pants.

23:16.834 --> 23:19.792
- You just can't.
- Well, I don't have
any shoes or pants,

23:19.792 --> 23:22.500
so that's what's up.
( crying )

23:22.500 --> 23:24.333
Here, take these.
Take these, takes these.

23:24.333 --> 23:28.166
Come on.
Come on.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.667
Look, put them on.

23:30.667 --> 23:31.834
( groans )

23:33.250 --> 23:35.792
Some jeans.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.792
Here you go.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.458
Thank you.

23:44.041 --> 23:45.583
These are kind of big.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.750
Well, yeah,
they're big on me,
too, obviously.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.542
Just-- what happened?
Can you tell me
what happened?

23:50.542 --> 23:52.250
( sighs )
I just need a phone

23:52.250 --> 23:54.375
so I can call
my boyfriend, Justin.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.083
( sniffles )

23:56.083 --> 23:59.291
Would you like to come
to my house and use the phone
and call Justin?

24:00.417 --> 24:03.000
Yeah.
That would be good.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.917
Thanks.

24:04.917 --> 24:09.000
'Cause, like, Justin
really, really worries
when he can't locate me.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.125
Yeah, I'm sure.
Come on.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.333
Does your mom
know where you are?

24:17.917 --> 24:20.583
I'm sorry.
This must be really hard.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.375
Can you tell me
about the incident?

24:22.375 --> 24:24.625
Do you feel unsafe?

24:24.625 --> 24:26.250
Yeah.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.625
My mom said I had to finish
my history homework

24:28.625 --> 24:30.208
before I went
to Justin's.

24:30.208 --> 24:32.250
And I was like,
"It's not due till Friday."

24:32.250 --> 24:34.667
And she was like,
"Well, you're gonna
finish it up right away."

24:34.667 --> 24:37.792
And I was like, "No!"
And I ran out.

24:37.792 --> 24:39.250
And then what happened?

24:39.250 --> 24:41.625
And then I was like,
"If it's due on Friday,

24:41.625 --> 24:43.417
I'm not finishing it
on Wednesday,

24:43.417 --> 24:45.041
and that's final!"

24:45.041 --> 24:47.083
( sighs, sniffles )

24:49.667 --> 24:53.667
So, you ran away
because your mom asked you
to do your homework?

24:54.875 --> 24:56.208
Yeah.

24:56.208 --> 24:58.542
And Justin's gonna be
at an away game tomorrow

24:58.542 --> 25:01.375
so I won't even get--
get to see him!

25:01.375 --> 25:03.125
( crying )

25:03.125 --> 25:04.750
Okay, give me back
my jeans.

25:04.750 --> 25:05.708
What?

25:05.708 --> 25:08.000
I said, give me back
my jeans.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.417
What the hell?

25:09.417 --> 25:10.959
No, you said
you were gonna help me.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.667
Yeah, that's when
I thought you were being,

25:12.667 --> 25:14.875
like, fiddled with
by your stepdad
or something.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.667
- What?
- Do you think your mom

25:16.667 --> 25:19.125
wants to tell you
to do your homework?

25:19.125 --> 25:20.125
Both: No.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.458
But that's
her entire job.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.083
That's her job
in the world.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.417
She has a million trillion
things she'd rather be doing.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.291
Things she might
want to experience.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.250
Life things
she hasn't enjoyed yet.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.375
But she stays and tells you
to do your homework

25:31.375 --> 25:33.917
because it's what's
fucking good for you.

25:33.917 --> 25:35.917
What do you think your mom's
gonna do when you get home?

25:35.917 --> 25:39.208
I don't know.
Hug me, I guess?

25:39.208 --> 25:41.125
Exactly!
'Cause she loves you

25:41.125 --> 25:42.959
more than anything else
in the world,

25:42.959 --> 25:44.667
and she knows you're
the most important thing

25:44.667 --> 25:47.208
even if it means being
emotionally abused by a brat

25:47.208 --> 25:49.291
day in and day out,
okay?

25:49.291 --> 25:50.959
She'll take care
of you forever

25:50.959 --> 25:54.458
even if it means endless,
endless pain!

25:54.458 --> 25:56.959
So give me back
my jeans!

25:56.959 --> 25:58.750
No, you psycho lady!

25:58.750 --> 26:00.667
Oh, you run,
you little harlot.

26:00.667 --> 26:03.166
Run as fast
as you can, okay?

26:03.166 --> 26:05.959
But life is gonna chase you,
it's gonna chase after you

26:05.959 --> 26:07.750
with problems
you can't even imagine.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.375
And I'd be
chasing you, too,

26:09.375 --> 26:12.792
if my vagina wasn't so busted
from having a baby.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.625
So go and just
fuck the shit out of Justin!

26:15.625 --> 26:17.542
Fuck him for me!

26:17.542 --> 26:20.125
That's not
how I meant that!

26:20.125 --> 26:22.625
( car engine starts )

26:27.000 --> 26:28.542
( siren blares )

26:35.834 --> 26:38.542
- ( dispatch chatter )
- You okay, ma'am?

26:38.542 --> 26:40.125
Yeah, absolutely.

26:40.125 --> 26:42.000
Do you
live near here?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.375
Yeah. Just, like,
a little while that way.

26:44.375 --> 26:48.375
So, uh, what brings
you out here without
pants and shoes?

26:48.375 --> 26:51.208
Oh, um, I had a baby
pretty recently, so.

26:51.208 --> 26:54.458
Mm. Sounds about right.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.125
Well, why don't you
get in the back of the car

26:56.125 --> 26:57.959
and I'll give you
a ride home.

26:57.959 --> 27:00.000
I'm really good,
but thank you.

27:07.875 --> 27:11.000
( officer over P.A. system )
Just making sure you're
getting home okay.

27:16.792 --> 27:18.083
Just take your time.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.834
( dispatch chatter
continues )

27:41.083 --> 27:45.542
I guess it's time for me
to start figuring out
what's next.

27:45.542 --> 27:47.041
Any ideas?

27:48.708 --> 27:51.417
A piece of me has always
wanted to go to law school.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.291
( groans )
So boring.

27:53.291 --> 27:55.458
- ( chuckles )
- No, I mean, it's a start.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.708
It's a start.

27:57.708 --> 28:01.166
It's mostly because
I just love the idea
of all the rules.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.291
I fucking love rules.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.250
Maybe you should be
a judge.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.625
Hmm.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.667
I have this friend
that's a judge.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.875
She is such a gas.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.333
Judge Patricia DeMango.

28:13.333 --> 28:14.959
( chuckles )

28:14.959 --> 28:17.500
She goes on five
Christian Mingle
dates a week.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.750
- No way.
- Yeah.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.333
Spray tan,

28:20.333 --> 28:23.250
big diamond in her
upper ear cartilage.

28:23.250 --> 28:26.000
But she is a really
good judge.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.417
- Mm.
- ( vehicle approaching )

28:28.417 --> 28:30.208
( officer over P.A. system )
You get home safe, now.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.125
Hannah:
Thank you,
Officer Schpoont.

28:36.959 --> 28:38.125
Hi.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.583
Hi.

28:39.583 --> 28:41.708
What happened
to your pants?

28:41.708 --> 28:44.041
You know, kind of
what you'd think.

28:44.041 --> 28:46.917
( train horn blaring
in distance )

28:50.667 --> 28:52.792
Thanks.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.125
Where's Grover?

28:55.792 --> 28:58.083
He's upstairs
asleep in your room.

29:00.792 --> 29:03.417
We gave him formula,

29:03.417 --> 29:04.625
and he liked it.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.750
Good.
Thanks.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.333
( Grover crying )

29:14.333 --> 29:16.375
No, no.
Guys, I got it.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.667
I got it.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.166
( crying )

30:06.917 --> 30:09.333
Shh.

30:09.333 --> 30:11.667

30:33.667 --> 30:35.542
That's good, Grover.

This episode is called
"Latching."

32:05.291 --> 32:07.625
It's the last episode ever
of GIRLS.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.959
And um, I think Judd Apatow was
surprisingly

32:10.959 --> 32:13.708
really the man behind this
breastfeeding plot.

32:13.708 --> 32:15.500
I think the seed of this was

32:15.834 --> 32:18.708
the fact that Hannah would be
losing her mind.

32:18.708 --> 32:21.125
a, a few months later we started
talking about

32:21.125 --> 32:24.083
post-partum depression and
her mental health issues

32:24.083 --> 32:26.333
coming up again
and so after the,

32:26.959 --> 32:29.000
I guess the
happiness of nine

32:29.000 --> 32:32.917
the reality that it's really
difficult would land in ten.

32:32.917 --> 32:35.041
I, I don't remember that
"Latching"

32:35.041 --> 32:36.333
being the first idea

32:36.333 --> 32:37.500
It might've been one of
the many.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.125
It was early on you and I were
on the phone.

32:39.125 --> 32:39.792
-LENA: Yeah.
-JUDD: Mm-hmm.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.250
and were talking about...

32:41.542 --> 32:43.750
-things that make you crazy
-Yeah.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.417
-after you have a baby
-Yeah.

32:45.417 --> 32:48.333
and we came up with the idea
of breastfeeding issues.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.959
LENA: When were all writing we
had everyone to make sure that

32:50.959 --> 32:52.750
the episode wasn't coming down
as like a

32:52.750 --> 32:54.375
-pro or con on breastfeeding
-JUDD: Mm-hmm.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.875
because we're not having a
position about what women

32:56.875 --> 32:58.000
should and shouldn't do.

32:58.291 --> 33:01.083
(BABY CRYING LOUDLY)

33:04.208 --> 33:05.250
I don't know what to say to
you?

33:05.792 --> 33:07.041
JUDD: I liked that sequence
where she's

33:07.500 --> 33:10.083
unable to breastfeed and she's
ranting at the baby

33:10.542 --> 33:14.125
and it feels like she's treating
the baby

33:14.625 --> 33:16.834
the way she would a boyfriend.

33:16.834 --> 33:19.041
She already has this
co-dependent thing

33:19.041 --> 33:20.875
she already feels like she's
being mistreated

33:20.875 --> 33:22.333
-by the baby and--
-JENNI: Right (LAUGHS).

33:22.542 --> 33:24.125
She's responding the way she's
responded to every guy

33:24.125 --> 33:25.417
-she's ever had in her life.
-JENNI: Yeah.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.417
JUDD: A lot of it was also about
just being present

33:27.417 --> 33:30.375
like can you be present,
with your baby

33:30.375 --> 33:32.708
not be running all
your problems,

33:32.708 --> 33:34.375
not be in your own head,

33:34.375 --> 33:36.583
and that would be this massive

33:36.583 --> 33:40.959
challenge for someone we've seen
be so selfish, for so long.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.125
I don't understand why you're
yelling at me

33:43.125 --> 33:44.750
when I'm in emotional pain?

33:44.750 --> 33:47.000
Yeah, well you know who else is
in emotional pain?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.875
-Who?
-Fucking everyone!

33:48.875 --> 33:52.375
And with Hannah and Loreen,
there's a lot of pain because

33:52.375 --> 33:54.208
they're mirroring each all the
time

33:54.208 --> 33:57.792
and so there's all of this
anxiety that comes from watching

33:57.792 --> 34:00.250
I think Loreen, watching Hannah,
do things that

34:00.750 --> 34:03.333
she's, knows that she herself
did or watching

34:03.333 --> 34:05.333
Hannah do things she wishes she
had done

34:05.333 --> 34:07.166
and there's a lot of projection

34:07.166 --> 34:09.041
that exists between mothers and
daughters

34:09.041 --> 34:11.083
and it felt like that
relationship

34:11.083 --> 34:13.208
needed the closure.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.500
JUDD: And Loreen's situation
is really hard.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.958
-JENNI: Yeah.
-I mean she's in a rough place

34:17.958 --> 34:21.250
you know losing her husband and
her partner and so

34:21.250 --> 34:22.958
I think we have a lot of
compassion for her

34:22.958 --> 34:26.083
as a character, but we also want
to be honest about

34:26.083 --> 34:28.291
-the emotions that brings up.
-LENA: Yeah.

34:28.291 --> 34:30.625
And a lot of it's funny but a
lot of its just rage and hurt.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.458
-Rage. So much rage.
-LENA: Yeah.

34:32.458 --> 34:34.750
She really loved Tad and she had
made a decision

34:34.750 --> 34:36.917
to kind of like make her life
with someone and compromise

34:36.917 --> 34:38.958
on certain things because she
thought

34:38.958 --> 34:40.917
that she would always
be safe and...

34:41.291 --> 34:43.708
So there is also something
kind of nice about Hannah

34:43.708 --> 34:46.333
becoming a single mother at
about the same time Loreen

34:46.333 --> 34:47.708
-becomes a single woman.
-Yeah.

34:48.125 --> 34:49.625
Are you happy here?

34:50.166 --> 34:51.833
I don't need to be happy.

34:52.333 --> 34:53.041
Why?

34:53.667 --> 34:55.875
It's just not my time, this is
important.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.291
Hannah's my best friend.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.125
Marie would never let them not
be friends.

34:59.125 --> 35:00.166
-Like she's gonna
-LENA: No,

35:00.667 --> 35:01.834
-succeed at that relationship.
-She's committed.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.000
LENA: She's the queen
of loyalty.

35:03.708 --> 35:05.750
But I think, you know she's
gonna take some time

35:05.750 --> 35:06.917
but she is gonna get out of that
house.

35:06.917 --> 35:07.875
Mm, yeah. She has to.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.750
And I think Loreen
pushes her and is like,

35:10.166 --> 35:11.792
"Don't make the same mistakes
I did."

35:11.792 --> 35:14.375
and like attach your life to
somebody else who's

35:14.375 --> 35:15.542
on their own path.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.667
That doesn't necessarily involve
you and...

35:18.000 --> 35:20.250
But Marnie's also like made a
commitment to be there

35:20.250 --> 35:22.333
for a little while but I think
you really see

35:22.667 --> 35:25.417
just how much they love each
other and how much Marnie's

35:25.417 --> 35:27.834
willing to put up with because
Hannah's a pretty big jerk

35:27.834 --> 35:29.792
to her for the majority of
the episode.

35:29.792 --> 35:31.083
You called my mom?

35:31.083 --> 35:32.667
I called her here for me.

35:32.667 --> 35:33.792
I wanted some help.

35:34.125 --> 35:36.417
You wanted to be here with me
and help me

35:36.417 --> 35:37.542
and you suck at it.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.583
It was hard to figure out who
Hannah encountered

35:41.583 --> 35:43.708
when she stormed out of her
house.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.291
Yeah, we had a bunch of
different versions of that.

35:45.291 --> 35:47.375
Yeah, but finally, it felt like
Hannah meeting

35:47.375 --> 35:50.166
someone younger
and seeing the way that they

35:50.166 --> 35:52.875
seeing their naiveté  and
their kind of brattiness

35:52.875 --> 35:55.041
and the way it might like shed
some light on her

35:55.041 --> 35:57.875
and that actress, Ruby Rose
she was amusing us

35:57.875 --> 36:00.875
so much when she read to play
the "teenage girl"

36:00.875 --> 36:01.917
-that Hannah encounters.
-JENNI: Oh my god I was like,

36:02.583 --> 36:04.917
"This is like a Paul Thomas
Anderson-style cast."

36:04.917 --> 36:06.291
-LENA: Yeah.
-I was so excited.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.125
At the end of it, it's really
about

36:08.125 --> 36:09.750
dropping that and realizing

36:09.750 --> 36:12.250
Oh I can't behave this way
anymore

36:12.250 --> 36:13.875
-JENNI: Yeah.
-and be a mother.

36:14.542 --> 36:17.583
I think something that we wanted
to say was that

36:17.583 --> 36:19.458
everyone's trying to figure it
out.

36:19.458 --> 36:22.000
It's like Grover's trying to
figure out how to eat,

36:22.000 --> 36:23.125
Marnie's trying to figure out

36:23.375 --> 36:25.458
how to become a person
with a life,

36:25.458 --> 36:26.917
Hannah's trying to figure out
why

36:26.917 --> 36:28.083
she's made the choices
she's made,

36:28.750 --> 36:30.375
Loreen's trying to let go of her
anger and it doesn't matter

36:30.375 --> 36:32.625
where you are, there's like this
lack of resolution

36:32.625 --> 36:35.750
but that you can always make the
decision to do better.

36:35.750 --> 36:38.917
So uh, what brings you out here
without uh, pants and shoes?

36:39.291 --> 36:41.875
Oh, um I had a baby pretty
recently, so...

36:42.500 --> 36:43.917
My favorite moment from the
episode,

36:44.166 --> 36:46.041
and it's towards the ends, is
when Hannah comes home

36:46.041 --> 36:47.959
from her weird journey

36:47.959 --> 36:49.375
and she's followed by the cop

36:49.375 --> 36:51.291
and Marnie and Loreen could
be angry at her,

36:51.291 --> 36:54.542
she ran away from her baby, she
was an asshole to both of them,

36:54.542 --> 36:57.458
she shirked responsibility, and
they're just like

36:57.458 --> 37:00.291
welcome her, and like that's to
me what like love is.

37:00.291 --> 37:02.708
Is like just letting somebody
come back and sit down

37:02.708 --> 37:04.458
between you with no questions
asked.

37:04.458 --> 37:06.166
I mean that's honestly how I
feel about these two

37:06.166 --> 37:07.458
I feel like I could act
really crazy

37:07.875 --> 37:09.542
then come and sit down between
you and it would be okay.

37:09.542 --> 37:12.166
And I just love that it's so,
moving to me.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.375
JUDD: My favorite moment
of the episode is like

37:14.375 --> 37:15.625
the last five seconds.

37:15.959 --> 37:18.166
I like the idea that it
ends with a giving gesture

37:18.166 --> 37:21.625
for somebody that's been
narcissistic for most of this.

37:22.125 --> 37:25.834
That her peace comes the
moment she's in the middle

37:25.834 --> 37:29.917
of a purely giving act,
to her son.

37:29.917 --> 37:31.458
And then you see for the
first time

37:31.458 --> 37:33.792
a look of complete, peace.
