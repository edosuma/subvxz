00:32.400 --> 00:35.920
<i>She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.</i>

00:39.880 --> 00:42.360
<i>I let her hear my footsteps.</i>

00:44.720 --> 00:47.400
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment.</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:50.160
Care for a smoke?

00:52.320 --> 00:55.800
Sure.
I'll take one.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.360
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

00:59.400 --> 01:03.560
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.960
I've watched you for days.

01:08.960 --> 01:12.600
You're everything a man could ever want.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.000
It's not just your face,

01:15.080 --> 01:19.480
your figure, or your voice.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.320
It's your eyes.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.880
All the things I see in your eyes.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.320
What is it you see in my eyes?

01:37.720 --> 01:40.280
I see a crazy calm.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.880
You're sick of running.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.960
You're ready to face what you have to face.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.760
But you don't want to face it alone.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.760
No.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.880
I don't want to face it alone.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.120
<i>The wind rises electric.</i>

02:07.200 --> 02:10.720
<i>She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.</i>

02:10.800 --> 02:14.600
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.</i>

02:16.120 --> 02:18.520
<i>I tell her that everything will be all right.</i>

02:20.320 --> 02:25.040
<i>That I'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, far away.</i>

02:27.800 --> 02:31.120
<i>I tell her I love her.</i>

02:34.680 --> 02:37.760
<i>The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.</i>

02:39.760 --> 02:42.440
<i>I hold her close until she's gone.</i>

02:45.120 --> 02:47.800
<i>I'll never know
what she was running from.</i>

02:50.320 --> 02:52.200
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning.</i>

04:41.480 --> 04:45.040
<i>Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.</i>

04:45.120 --> 04:47.880
<i>Early retirement.
Not my idea.</i>

04:47.960 --> 04:50.760
<i>Doctor's orders.
Heart condition.</i>

04:50.880 --> 04:53.400
<i>"Angina," he calls it.</i>

04:54.200 --> 04:57.600
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.</i>

04:57.680 --> 05:01.200
<i>It, and the 30-odd years
of protecting and serving and tears</i>

05:01.280 --> 05:05.720
<i>and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents.</i>

05:06.160 --> 05:08.760
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.</i>

05:08.840 --> 05:13.440
<i>About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.</i>

05:13.480 --> 05:16.800
<i>And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.</i>

05:16.840 --> 05:21.600
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere,
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.</i>

05:26.440 --> 05:30.360
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.600
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.520
Let go of my coat, Bob.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.520
You're draggin' me down with you.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.880
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.200
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.560
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.400
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.520
Victim number four!

05:52.600 --> 05:55.000
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.280
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.120
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

06:01.160 --> 06:05.440
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.080
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.040
Settle down and think straight.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.800
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.760
You ain't savin' anyone.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.480
You got a great attitude, Bob.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.880
Real credit to the force, you are.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.400
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.120
Heck, Bob,

06:34.520 --> 06:36.000
maybe you are right.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.280
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.800
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

06:42.840 --> 06:45.400
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement.</i>

06:45.480 --> 06:48.160
<i>Nancy Callahan, age 11.</i>

06:48.240 --> 06:50.640
<i>For all I know, she's dead already.</i>

06:52.920 --> 06:55.400
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.760
You've been very quiet.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.000
Don't be scared.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.080
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

07:02.720 --> 07:07.000
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.240
He's a very nice man.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.240
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where
Weevil said they took her, and it hits.</i>

07:15.280 --> 07:17.760
<i>Icked spot of indigestion.</i>

07:17.840 --> 07:20.120
<i>At least that's what I pray it is.</i>

07:20.200 --> 07:22.440
...lighthearted
and momentary digression.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.320
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.280
For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.640
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.720
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -</i>

07:35.840 --> 07:39.920
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.</i>

07:40.320 --> 07:42.680
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

07:42.760 --> 07:45.320
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

07:45.360 --> 07:48.480
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.680
<i>Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.</i>

07:51.720 --> 07:53.680
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

07:53.760 --> 07:56.640
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

07:56.720 --> 07:59.160
shall surely be athwart us.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.160
<i>Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.</i>

08:12.240 --> 08:14.160
<i>But it won't slow down.</i>

08:16.200 --> 08:18.120
<i>Get over it.</i>

08:18.560 --> 08:20.280
<i>She needs you.</i>

08:20.360 --> 08:22.000
We're all done here, Benny.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.440
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.320
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.640
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

08:29.720 --> 08:35.240
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

08:35.320 --> 08:38.280
You must be awfully scared now.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.600
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.360
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.000
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.400
Don't you cry now.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.480
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this.</i>

08:56.560 --> 08:58.800
<i>Just take the pill he gave you.</i>

09:07.400 --> 09:09.360
<i>No need to play it quiet.</i>

09:09.480 --> 09:11.360
<i>Not anymore.</i>

09:12.760 --> 09:16.280
<i>Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.</i>

09:16.360 --> 09:18.960
<i>What the hell?
Go out with a bang.</i>

09:19.440 --> 09:21.120
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream.</i>

09:21.200 --> 09:23.680
<i>I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,</i>

09:23.760 --> 09:28.400
<i>all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.</i>

09:28.480 --> 09:32.960
<i>No screams.
Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late.</i>

09:43.040 --> 09:47.080
<i>It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.</i>

09:53.040 --> 09:55.560
Roark.
Give it up.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.880
Let the girl go.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.000
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.040
You know who I am.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.280
You know who my father is!

10:04.320 --> 10:06.760
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.440
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.520
Sure, I can.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.640
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.600
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.640
<i>I take his weapons away.</i>

10:34.280 --> 10:35.800
<i>Both of them.</i>

10:45.960 --> 10:47.840
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

10:47.960 --> 10:50.800
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.240
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.520
Never better.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.600
I'm ready to kick your ass.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.400
<i>Keep him talking.
Buy time.</i>

11:04.480 --> 11:07.000
<i>Just a few more minutes.
Just till the backup gets here.</i>

11:07.080 --> 11:10.880
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.680
<i>Keep his mind off the girl -
skinny little Nancy.</i>

11:14.760 --> 11:16.440
<i>He can't kill her
once the backup gets here.</i>

11:16.520 --> 11:18.920
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.800
Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.040
- What a tough man you are?
- You stay right where you're at.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.920
You shoot your partner in the back...

11:27.960 --> 11:30.040
then you try to scare a little girl.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.240
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.400
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.360
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.720
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

11:43.520 --> 11:45.440
You'll never be able to stop me.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.000
<i>I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.</i>

11:58.760 --> 12:00.680
<i>The sirens are close now.</i>

12:01.680 --> 12:03.920
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

12:11.800 --> 12:15.920
<i>Things go dark.
I don't mind much.</i>

12:16.680 --> 12:20.280
<i>Getting sleepy.
It's OK.</i>

12:20.360 --> 12:22.520
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

12:22.640 --> 12:24.960
<i>An old man dies,</i>

12:25.000 --> 12:27.480
<i>a little girl lives.</i>

12:27.560 --> 12:29.520
<i>Fair trade.</i>

12:34.240 --> 12:36.520
<i>The night is hot as hell.</i>

12:36.560 --> 12:39.760
<i>It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.</i>

12:41.000 --> 12:43.280
<i>I'm staring at a goddess.</i>

12:43.320 --> 12:45.680
<i>She's telling me she wants me.</i>

12:45.720 --> 12:49.440
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.</i>

12:49.480 --> 12:51.000
I want you.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.400
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

13:00.200 --> 13:01.800
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

13:06.240 --> 13:07.400
<i>The goddess.</i>

13:12.120 --> 13:13.800
I need you.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
<i>Goldie.</i>

13:18.040 --> 13:20.360
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

13:27.960 --> 13:31.320
<i>Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.</i>

13:31.440 --> 13:34.400
<i>And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.</i>

13:34.440 --> 13:38.400
<i>And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.</i>

13:38.480 --> 13:41.680
<i>You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

13:41.760 --> 13:44.400
<i>aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.</i>

13:44.480 --> 13:47.200
<i>She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.</i>

13:47.280 --> 13:51.520
<i>Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.</i>

13:52.000 --> 13:55.840
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?</i>

13:55.960 --> 13:58.240
<i>Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,</i>

13:58.320 --> 14:01.520
<i>giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?</i>

14:01.560 --> 14:04.280
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks.</i>

14:04.360 --> 14:07.160
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

14:07.200 --> 14:09.480
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

14:11.520 --> 14:14.920
<i>The cops - they're telling me too much,</i>

14:15.000 --> 14:16.840
<i>showing up before anybody
but me and the killer</i>

14:16.880 --> 14:19.040
<i>could know there's been a murder.</i>

14:19.120 --> 14:22.480
<i>Somebody paid good money
for this frame.</i>

14:22.960 --> 14:25.160
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet.</i>

14:25.200 --> 14:28.240
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way.</i>

14:32.520 --> 14:35.480
<i>Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie.</i>

14:40.160 --> 14:42.280
Open up, police!

14:42.360 --> 14:44.040
I'll be right out.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.600
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie.</i>

15:17.320 --> 15:21.440
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight,</i>

15:21.520 --> 15:25.120
<i>but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.</i>

15:25.200 --> 15:27.760
<i>And when I find out who did it,</i>

15:27.840 --> 15:30.800
<i>it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.</i>

15:30.920 --> 15:34.400
<i>It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.</i>

15:34.520 --> 15:37.360
<i>And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to</i>

15:37.440 --> 15:40.880
<i>will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.</i>

15:40.960 --> 15:42.320
<i>I love you, Goldie.</i>

16:03.320 --> 16:05.680
Claire?

16:14.640 --> 16:18.440
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

16:18.480 --> 16:23.240
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

16:23.280 --> 16:27.280
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

16:27.360 --> 16:28.960
No.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.480
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.760
Thanks.
You're the best.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.280
<i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i>

16:36.400 --> 16:38.480
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i>

16:38.560 --> 16:41.920
<i>Its that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.</i>

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.</i>

16:45.080 --> 16:48.720
<i>She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.</i>

16:49.480 --> 16:52.680
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.040
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

16:56.120 --> 17:00.480
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.240
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

17:03.280 --> 17:06.200
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.839
This isn't some barroom brawl.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.960
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.560
Hey, hey.
This is big.

17:13.640 --> 17:17.240
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

17:17.319 --> 17:20.119
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.560
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.599
They're back.
There's no choices left.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.440
And I'm ready for war.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.880
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.280
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.280
But I'm out now.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.720
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.720
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.280
<i>So you were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?</i>

17:54.360 --> 17:56.880
<i>Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.</i>

17:56.960 --> 17:59.600
<i>So you hit the saloons, the bad places,</i>

17:59.680 --> 18:03.800
<i>looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.</i>

18:03.880 --> 18:06.440
<i>Well, I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,</i>

18:06.520 --> 18:09.280
<i>and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.</i>

18:10.600 --> 18:13.440
<i>Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...</i>

18:13.520 --> 18:16.520
<i>- Leave your hands off Nancy.
... and you could find anything.</i>

18:16.640 --> 18:19.200
That coat looks like Baghdad.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.720
So does your face.
Take off!

18:27.320 --> 18:30.240
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.640
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i>

18:34.400 --> 18:39.600
<i>Nancy's just getting started with her gig,
but already the crowd's breathing hard.</i>

18:39.680 --> 18:41.720
<i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,</i>

18:41.800 --> 18:45.400
<i>shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.</i>

18:45.880 --> 18:48.800
<i>But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.</i>

18:49.840 --> 18:51.200
What'll it be, Marv?

18:51.280 --> 18:54.040
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.600
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.680
<i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i>

19:14.760 --> 19:18.320
<i>He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.</i>

19:18.440 --> 19:20.800
<i>He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,</i>

19:20.840 --> 19:23.120
<i>swinging an ax into somebody's face.</i>

19:23.640 --> 19:27.920
<i>Or in a Roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him.</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:31.760
<i>They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.</i>

19:34.400 --> 19:37.080
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.920
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.320
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

19:47.440 --> 19:52.200
<i>I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.</i>

19:59.920 --> 20:02.200
- Take it off.
- What?

20:02.280 --> 20:04.600
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.040
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

20:07.120 --> 20:10.560
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.880
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.080
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.240
I don't hear you giving me any names.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.760
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

20:29.640 --> 20:34.200
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.520
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.360
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.680
Thanks again.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.560
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i>

20:56.640 --> 21:00.600
<i>For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.</i>

21:00.680 --> 21:03.040
<i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i>

21:03.560 --> 21:05.160
Bastard.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.240
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.600
Feel like talking, Louie?

21:12.680 --> 21:15.080
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

21:15.160 --> 21:16.840
How many for the kill?

21:16.920 --> 21:19.400
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.800
He'll never talk.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.760
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.760
<i>Connelly talks.
They all talk.</i>

21:35.640 --> 21:37.800
And what have been
your sins, my son?

21:37.880 --> 21:40.360
Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

21:40.440 --> 21:43.360
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.280
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.400
You're speaking figuratively.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.880
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

21:52.960 --> 21:55.360
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.480
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

21:58.600 --> 22:04.240
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.600
Tortured 'em first.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.840
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.560
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

22:12.640 --> 22:17.320
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.000
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.680
Just give me a damn name.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.960
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

22:27.040 --> 22:29.880
feeding me garbage like that.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.040
It can't be that big.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.360
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.280
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.240
And while you're at it,

22:38.280 --> 22:43.400
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.840
<i>Worth dying for.</i>

22:45.920 --> 22:47.840
<i>Worth killing for.</i>

22:47.920 --> 22:50.160
<i>Worth going to hell for.</i>

22:50.240 --> 22:52.120
Amen.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.280
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,</i>

22:58.320 --> 23:01.720
<i>or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.</i>

23:01.800 --> 23:05.720
<i>Modern cars -
they all look like electric shavers.</i>

23:12.080 --> 23:13.640
Goldie.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.440
Goldie!

23:27.760 --> 23:29.880
It couldn't be Goldie.

23:29.960 --> 23:34.040
<i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.</i>

23:34.160 --> 23:37.760
<i>I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.</i>

23:37.840 --> 23:39.680
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i>

23:39.760 --> 23:41.120
<i>Goldie's dead,</i>

23:41.200 --> 23:45.000
<i>and that's the whole reason
that I've been doing what I've been doing.</i>

23:45.040 --> 23:48.720
<i>When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.</i>

23:51.400 --> 23:56.680
<i>The cold thing, it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won't let go.</i>

23:57.400 --> 23:59.920
<i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i>

24:00.000 --> 24:01.640
<i>People have died here...</i>

24:03.400 --> 24:04.960
<i>...the wrong way.</i>

24:07.560 --> 24:09.480
I don't want to fight, pooch.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.040
I got no gripe with you.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.120
Easy, boy.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.800
<i>No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.</i>

24:24.880 --> 24:27.480
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,</i>

24:27.560 --> 24:31.440
<i>because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.</i>

24:31.920 --> 24:34.160
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i>

24:37.920 --> 24:39.360
Here we go.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.400
<i>It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.</i>

24:52.800 --> 24:57.400
<i>I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.</i>

24:57.480 --> 25:00.960
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.</i>

25:01.360 --> 25:04.800
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.360
You killed Goldie.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.000
It was...

25:10.520 --> 25:12.000
<i>I blew it, Goldie.</i>

25:12.640 --> 25:15.040
<i>I found your killer,
but he was better than me.</i>

25:15.640 --> 25:17.600
<i>Too quiet, too quick.</i>

25:17.680 --> 25:20.040
<i>A killer born.</i>

25:20.120 --> 25:22.520
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

25:35.000 --> 25:38.600
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.920
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.640
The wolf just gets scraps.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.600
Bones.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.920
It's him.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.240
He eats people.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.480
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.760
Just like they were steaks.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.040
Now he's got both of us.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.200
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.680
Just look at the heads on the wall.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.800
The heads on the wall.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.320
The heads on the wall.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.200
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

26:19.320 --> 26:23.280
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.960
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

26:26.040 --> 26:30.760
He made me watch!

26:37.960 --> 26:40.200
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.640
<i>Dames.
Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.</i>

26:44.760 --> 26:47.880
<i>And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.</i>

26:48.520 --> 26:50.480
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

26:50.600 --> 26:55.000
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.160
Any leads?

26:57.240 --> 27:00.800
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

27:00.880 --> 27:05.520
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.120
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.200
The dead one.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.360
Goldie.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.800
I didn't know she was a hooker.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.920
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

27:20.840 --> 27:25.360
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.040
She must have shown you quite a time.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.160
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.320
Kevin!

27:36.280 --> 27:39.920
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name.</i>

27:40.000 --> 27:41.920
I'll see you later, Kevin.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.480
Let's go.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.440
They're done checking the house.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.440
They're coming this way.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.480
Bastards.
I'll show them.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.280
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.000
No, don't shoot!
Please.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.240
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.680
He's unconscious and unarmed,

28:31.720 --> 28:34.600
so there's no need to kill him.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.800
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.040
Here's a sign!

28:58.200 --> 29:01.800
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.600
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed
and what he told me.</i>

29:12.640 --> 29:15.320
<i>I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,</i>

29:15.400 --> 29:17.840
<i>so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.</i>

29:18.440 --> 29:22.040
<i>It wasn't till I showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it.</i>

29:22.560 --> 29:27.520
<i>Just a name
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:30.560
<i>Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.</i>

29:30.640 --> 29:35.000
<i>Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.</i>

29:35.080 --> 29:38.880
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.</i>

29:38.920 --> 29:42.360
<i>He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i>

29:42.920 --> 29:47.240
<i>And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.</i>

29:47.320 --> 29:52.000
<i>I'm getting used to the idea.
More and more, I'm liking the sound of it.</i>

29:53.480 --> 29:56.960
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i>

29:57.080 --> 29:58.880
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

29:58.920 --> 30:00.720
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

30:00.800 --> 30:02.880
<i>I get confused sometimes.</i>

30:02.960 --> 30:06.720
<i>And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.</i>

30:06.800 --> 30:08.920
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

30:09.000 --> 30:14.040
<i>What if I've finally turned into what
they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

30:14.120 --> 30:16.440
<i>A maniac.</i>

30:16.520 --> 30:18.800
<i>A psycho killer.</i>

30:18.840 --> 30:21.880
<i>Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.</i>

30:21.920 --> 30:23.880
<i>I've gotta know for sure.</i>

30:26.840 --> 30:31.120
<i>The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.</i>

30:31.240 --> 30:33.840
<i>For an hour or so,
I asked around about Goldie.</i>

30:33.920 --> 30:36.600
<i>I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.</i>

30:36.680 --> 30:38.720
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i>

30:38.800 --> 30:41.440
<i>and if she was, she has roots here</i>

30:41.520 --> 30:44.240
<i>friends, maybe even family.</i>

30:48.720 --> 30:51.720
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.560
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

31:05.640 --> 31:09.520
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.040
No wonder I'm seeing things.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.560
Bastard!

31:19.040 --> 31:20.880
He's crazy.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.880
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.720
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

31:27.800 --> 31:30.040
Because that's my name, you ape.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.880
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.200
I guess she was the nice one.

31:43.160 --> 31:46.600
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

31:46.680 --> 31:48.600
What did you do to them?

31:48.680 --> 31:51.080
You crazy goddamn broad.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.000
Just take a look at this mug.

31:53.080 --> 31:57.120
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

31:57.200 --> 32:00.640
None of you would, but Goldie.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.760
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

32:03.880 --> 32:08.920
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

32:08.960 --> 32:13.840
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

32:14.440 --> 32:19.160
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.720
So, go ahead, doll.

32:22.800 --> 32:27.320
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.960
Nuts.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.160
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

32:40.520 --> 32:45.080
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

32:45.160 --> 32:46.960
You sat there and took it,

32:47.040 --> 32:49.880
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

32:49.920 --> 32:54.240
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.440
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

32:57.520 --> 32:59.480
and I don't hurt girls.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.840
I need a pair of handcuffs.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.840
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.720
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.560
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

33:11.680 --> 33:14.880
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.280
I know that sounds crazy.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.560
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

33:20.640 --> 33:24.960
<i>Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.</i>

33:25.040 --> 33:27.360
<i>I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,</i>

33:27.440 --> 33:32.200
<i>but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one, and I taste her lipstick on it.</i>

33:32.280 --> 33:36.600
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.</i>

33:36.680 --> 33:41.040
<i>I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i>

33:41.160 --> 33:43.200
<i>But she isn't Goldie.</i>

33:43.320 --> 33:45.240
<i>Yeah, yeah.
This'll do.</i>

33:45.360 --> 33:50.560
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

33:51.640 --> 33:53.880
and a spool of razor wire...

33:54.960 --> 33:58.960
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.880
Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

34:01.960 --> 34:03.400
You can bet your ass.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.640
She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.080
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

34:11.199 --> 34:16.159
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

34:16.239 --> 34:20.520
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.280
You know, the way I look.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.719
<i>I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.</i>

34:27.760 --> 34:30.639
<i>It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.</i>

34:30.679 --> 34:34.760
<i>I check the list
rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i>

34:34.840 --> 34:38.719
<i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i>

34:38.760 --> 34:40.920
<i>Gladys and my mitts.</i>

34:41.000 --> 34:44.800
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.320
Keep the engine runnin'.

34:47.440 --> 34:52.000
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.920
Kill him for me, Marv.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.920
Kill him good.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.680
I won't let you down, Goldie.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.080
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i>

35:17.160 --> 35:21.560
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.</i>

35:34.920 --> 35:37.400
Come on, you son of a bitch.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.120
<i>Damn, he's slick.</i>

35:51.760 --> 35:54.080
Is that the best you can do, creep?

35:55.960 --> 35:59.600
<i>That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.</i>

36:00.760 --> 36:04.960
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

36:08.800 --> 36:13.280
<i>I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.</i>

36:13.320 --> 36:16.840
<i>My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.</i>

36:16.920 --> 36:20.560
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.080
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.800
Oh, but I want to...

36:25.880 --> 36:29.800
<i>I'm sorry, kid,
but I haven't even started with this creep,</i>

36:29.880 --> 36:33.920
<i>and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.</i>

36:33.960 --> 36:36.880
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

36:36.960 --> 36:40.040
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.880
It's all that sawing and tying.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.080
It's not as easy as it looks.

36:46.120 --> 36:51.240
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.600
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

36:57.680 --> 37:02.760
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.880
Well, what do you know?

37:08.680 --> 37:11.200
Look who's here.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.680
Here he comes.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.760
That's a good dog.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.680
<i>He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

37:25.800 --> 37:28.280
<i>and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.</i>

37:28.360 --> 37:32.040
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.</i>

37:32.120 --> 37:36.120
<i>Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.</i>

37:36.560 --> 37:38.920
<i>He never screams.</i>

37:41.680 --> 37:44.760
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

37:44.840 --> 37:48.120
<i>and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes," like always.</i>

37:48.200 --> 37:50.840
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

37:50.920 --> 37:53.760
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

37:53.840 --> 37:56.640
<i>There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i>

37:56.720 --> 37:59.280
<i>Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

37:59.400 --> 38:01.640
<i>and I straightened him out but good.</i>

38:01.720 --> 38:05.240
<i>It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.</i>

38:05.320 --> 38:07.000
So, what do you want me to do with her?

38:07.080 --> 38:11.520
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

38:11.560 --> 38:14.560
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

38:14.640 --> 38:17.280
Hell, no.
I like it here.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.840
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit</i>

38:22.920 --> 38:25.120
<i>so as not to get any attention.</i>

38:25.520 --> 38:29.280
<i>My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.</i>

38:29.320 --> 38:31.160
<i>I owe you, Goldie.</i>

38:31.240 --> 38:33.560
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i>

38:33.600 --> 38:36.480
<i>So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose -</i>

38:36.560 --> 38:40.880
<i>hell, I'll die laughing
if I know I've done this one thing right.</i>

38:45.360 --> 38:47.840
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.520
<i>All right, keep a lookout.</i>

39:05.760 --> 39:08.920
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.120
The dog ate the rest.

39:19.440 --> 39:23.480
Oh, my God.
You monster.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.240
You demon.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.680
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

39:29.360 --> 39:34.680
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

39:35.080 --> 39:38.480
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

39:39.080 --> 39:44.000
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.200
When he came to me...

39:47.640 --> 39:49.840
he was a tormented boy.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.240
Tormented by guilt.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.400
I tried to counsel him.

39:58.880 --> 40:03.160
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

40:03.520 --> 40:08.120
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.000
What the hell do you know?

40:11.080 --> 40:13.440
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.320
He didn't just eat their bodies,

40:16.720 --> 40:18.760
he ate their souls.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.600
And I joined in.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.840
They were all whores.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.600
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

40:33.040 --> 40:37.840
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.160
<i>She stayed in public places.</i>

40:40.240 --> 40:42.480
<i>And then with you.</i>

40:42.520 --> 40:43.920
<i>You were so convenient.</i>

40:44.320 --> 40:47.080
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</i>

40:47.160 --> 40:49.640
Who would believe a thug like you?

40:49.680 --> 40:51.240
<i>Kevin killed her.</i>

40:51.320 --> 40:54.880
<i>I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.</i>

40:54.960 --> 40:56.360
<i>You wouldn't stop.</i>

40:56.400 --> 40:59.240
And now he's dead and you're here to...

41:00.800 --> 41:02.600
eliminate me.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.680
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

41:08.360 --> 41:13.120
Killing a helpless old fart?

41:14.120 --> 41:15.880
The killing, no.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.680
No satisfaction.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.160
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.040
Kevin...

41:30.440 --> 41:32.520
we're going home.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.440
You can scream now if you want to.

41:45.720 --> 41:50.320
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.</i>

41:50.400 --> 41:51.840
<i>And when his eyes go dead,</i>

41:51.920 --> 41:56.000
<i>the hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what I've done to him.</i>

41:57.000 --> 41:58.920
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

42:06.120 --> 42:07.920
<i>Jerks.</i>

42:07.960 --> 42:11.640
<i>They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.</i>

42:11.720 --> 42:13.400
<i>It's so stupid.</i>

42:13.520 --> 42:17.280
<i>Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.</i>

42:17.400 --> 42:19.480
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

42:20.080 --> 42:23.800
<i>Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.</i>

42:23.880 --> 42:27.640
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.</i>

42:27.680 --> 42:31.360
<i>After a while,
I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.</i>

42:32.280 --> 42:33.880
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

42:33.960 --> 42:36.760
<i>before the cops kick them out
from under me.</i>

42:36.840 --> 42:38.800
<i>They don't ask me any questions.</i>

42:38.840 --> 42:43.120
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.</i>

42:43.240 --> 42:45.160
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

42:45.240 --> 42:48.600
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.</i>

42:48.720 --> 42:53.040
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

42:53.160 --> 42:57.360
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession,
they'll kill my mom.</i>

42:57.440 --> 43:00.760
<i>I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.</i>

43:00.840 --> 43:03.800
<i>From then on,
it's the circus everybody wants it to be.</i>

43:04.480 --> 43:08.120
<i>They nail me for the works -
not just the people I did kill,</i>

43:08.200 --> 43:12.200
<i>but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,</i>

43:12.280 --> 43:14.600
<i>and even Goldie.</i>

43:15.240 --> 43:19.640
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.</i>

43:20.680 --> 43:23.520
<i>Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,</i>

43:23.600 --> 43:26.680
<i>when I get my first surprise in 18 months.</i>

43:28.200 --> 43:30.520
<i>My only visitor.</i>

43:30.560 --> 43:33.440
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent.</i>

43:33.520 --> 43:36.480
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

43:41.440 --> 43:43.960
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

43:44.040 --> 43:47.120
I got confused again.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.720
Just seeing you like this.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.440
You can call me Goldie.

44:03.200 --> 44:06.080
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

44:06.160 --> 44:08.680
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

44:08.760 --> 44:10.480
<i>The goddess.</i>

44:11.720 --> 44:13.800
<i>Goldie.</i>

44:13.880 --> 44:16.400
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

44:18.960 --> 44:22.280
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.</i>

44:22.400 --> 44:26.720
<i>They even throw in a brew.
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.</i>

44:26.840 --> 44:31.320
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.</i>

44:31.360 --> 44:34.120
<i>And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.</i>

44:34.200 --> 44:36.640
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

44:36.720 --> 44:39.320
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.960
You heard the man.
Hit it.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.800
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

45:06.440 --> 45:07.520
He's gone.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.720
Forget it, man.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.760
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.320
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in.

45:31.440 --> 45:34.720
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.960
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.760
Ha. It meant plenty.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.880
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

45:43.960 --> 45:46.520
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.080
I know you're angry, baby.

45:48.160 --> 45:51.200
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.040
There's a difference
between getting honked off

45:53.080 --> 45:54.760
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

45:54.880 --> 45:58.800
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

45:58.920 --> 46:01.360
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

46:01.480 --> 46:04.040
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

46:04.120 --> 46:06.880
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

46:06.960 --> 46:09.800
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.160
That hurt, Shellie.

46:12.240 --> 46:17.600
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

46:17.680 --> 46:20.120
I am impossible to get.

46:20.200 --> 46:26.440
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

46:26.520 --> 46:29.240
Get help and get lost.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.920
Just open the door.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.680
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

46:35.760 --> 46:39.680
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

46:41.240 --> 46:44.480
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

46:44.560 --> 46:48.080
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

46:48.160 --> 46:51.480
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.600
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

46:53.680 --> 46:56.200
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

46:56.280 --> 47:01.000
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

47:01.080 --> 47:06.400
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

47:07.600 --> 47:09.920
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

47:09.960 --> 47:13.000
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.120
You feel like taking them on?

47:15.160 --> 47:18.120
You are teasing me, baby.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.600
Some of my best friends...

47:21.720 --> 47:24.200
But you're really pushing my buttons.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.440
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

47:26.520 --> 47:29.240
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

47:29.280 --> 47:32.360
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.200
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.520
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

47:37.560 --> 47:40.440
All right.
All right, all right!

47:43.080 --> 47:46.400
Troops, make yourself at home.

47:54.760 --> 47:57.640
You brought your whole pack with you?

47:57.680 --> 48:00.440
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

48:00.480 --> 48:02.080
You're gonna love this, baby.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.880
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

48:04.960 --> 48:08.280
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

48:08.400 --> 48:10.120
and it's gonna be great.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.240
I ain't calling up nobody.

48:16.520 --> 48:21.160
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

48:21.240 --> 48:25.440
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

48:25.520 --> 48:28.720
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.120
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

48:32.200 --> 48:36.040
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

48:36.160 --> 48:38.520
'cause you scared him so bad.

48:40.640 --> 48:44.480
You think
I have no feelings at all.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.600
If you're gonna slug me,

48:46.640 --> 48:49.560
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

48:49.640 --> 48:53.600
There you go,
lying about me again,

48:53.680 --> 48:56.160
right in front of my friends.

48:56.240 --> 48:59.400
I have never hit a woman in my life.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.920
That's showing her, man.

49:06.960 --> 49:11.320
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

49:11.440 --> 49:14.240
Baby, we're all here to have a good time.

49:14.320 --> 49:17.960
I gotta take a leak.

49:18.040 --> 49:20.400
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

49:20.800 --> 49:23.920
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.400
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

49:26.480 --> 49:30.160
There you go, after my nuts again.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.400
But I forgive you.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.400
I'm a generous guy.

49:34.480 --> 49:38.760
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

49:38.800 --> 49:41.800
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.280
My temper you don't have to worry about.

49:45.680 --> 49:49.280
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.920
I've been told.

49:54.040 --> 49:58.600
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

49:58.680 --> 50:01.320
Answer me!

50:01.400 --> 50:03.400
I don't need this grief.

50:03.480 --> 50:09.120
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

50:09.200 --> 50:13.880
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

50:13.960 --> 50:17.440
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

50:17.520 --> 50:21.840
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

50:21.880 --> 50:27.000
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.360
You didn't flush.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.160
Troops, get outta here.

51:22.280 --> 51:24.320
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.160
Now!

51:44.160 --> 51:46.240
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

51:46.280 --> 51:49.120
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

51:49.160 --> 51:51.240
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.080
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

51:55.160 --> 51:59.000
Dwight, he was from a while back,

51:59.080 --> 52:02.240
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

52:02.280 --> 52:05.920
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

52:05.960 --> 52:08.320
And it was only once.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.320
I've done some dumb things.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.280
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

52:12.360 --> 52:14.960
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

52:15.040 --> 52:19.080
But this guy, he's a menace.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.920
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.400
I'll call you later.

52:25.480 --> 52:26.880
No, don't go!

52:27.000 --> 52:29.200
<i>Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out</i>

52:29.240 --> 52:31.840
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter.</i>

52:31.920 --> 52:35.440
<i>- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop," but I can't be sure.</i>

52:36.080 --> 52:39.520
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,
but I can't just go home and forget about it,</i>

52:39.560 --> 52:42.800
<i>and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.</i>

52:42.880 --> 52:48.240
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.</i>

52:48.320 --> 52:51.480
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

52:51.600 --> 52:54.400
You fool.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.640
You damned fool.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.400
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

52:58.440 --> 53:01.880
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i>

53:01.960 --> 53:03.880
<i>I'm speeding.</i>

53:03.920 --> 53:08.560
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed.
And if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

53:08.600 --> 53:12.800
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,</i>

53:12.880 --> 53:15.880
<i>the last thing you want
is to get noticed.</i>

53:17.160 --> 53:21.440
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,</i>

53:21.520 --> 53:24.520
<i>there's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.</i>

53:24.640 --> 53:30.040
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this,
or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

53:30.640 --> 53:34.240
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.</i>

53:34.320 --> 53:36.800
Watch it, Jack!

53:42.520 --> 53:44.200
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

53:44.280 --> 53:47.640
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

53:47.720 --> 53:50.680
<i>My gut tightens up.</i>

53:50.720 --> 53:54.920
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.</i>

53:57.360 --> 53:59.160
<i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i>

53:59.240 --> 54:02.360
<i>He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.</i>

54:02.440 --> 54:06.560
<i>The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.</i>

54:06.600 --> 54:08.520
<i>If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules,</i>

54:08.520 --> 54:10.840
<i>they'll make all your dreams come true.</i>

54:10.920 --> 54:14.560
<i>But if you cross 'em, you're a corpse.</i>

54:22.480 --> 54:24.840
Hey, baby.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.680
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

54:30.080 --> 54:34.400
Sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

54:34.520 --> 54:37.400
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

54:38.040 --> 54:41.320
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.360
I don't do talk jobs, either.

54:43.440 --> 54:48.280
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.880
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.000
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

54:54.080 --> 54:57.520
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

54:57.600 --> 54:59.920
well...

55:00.040 --> 55:02.360
there's only so much a man can take.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.520
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.880
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.440
The Amigo's a fag joint.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.680
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

55:17.840 --> 55:21.040
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

55:21.080 --> 55:23.520
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.560
Everything's under control.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.680
Enjoy the show.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.560
<i>There's no use arguing with her.</i>

55:31.680 --> 55:34.400
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i>

55:34.480 --> 55:37.360
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

55:37.440 --> 55:40.240
Not right now, Gail.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.040
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

55:42.520 --> 55:46.160
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

55:46.240 --> 55:49.160
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

55:49.240 --> 55:52.120
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.960
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.040
One of them thinks he is.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.000
He's outta control.

56:00.080 --> 56:03.400
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

56:03.480 --> 56:06.920
Us helpless little girls.

56:07.560 --> 56:11.400
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i>

56:11.520 --> 56:14.960
<i>and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.</i>

56:15.000 --> 56:17.640
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

56:17.720 --> 56:20.080
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

56:20.120 --> 56:22.480
from seeing what Miho can do.

56:22.560 --> 56:26.400
And she's been aching for some practice.

56:27.360 --> 56:31.880
<i>She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i>

56:31.960 --> 56:35.960
<i>- Deadly little Miho.
- You're running out of alley, cowboy.</i>

56:36.520 --> 56:40.160
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.800
You're a sassy little thing.

56:42.880 --> 56:47.480
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

56:47.560 --> 56:51.480
<i>The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.</i>

56:51.520 --> 56:55.240
<i>So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.</i>

56:55.320 --> 56:58.560
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?</i>

56:58.640 --> 57:01.760
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

57:01.800 --> 57:06.320
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

57:06.400 --> 57:07.760
And they won't.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.840
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

57:09.960 --> 57:13.280
<i>Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.</i>

57:13.360 --> 57:17.440
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.360
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

57:20.480 --> 57:23.560
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

57:23.600 --> 57:27.280
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.720
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.920
You wanna see it?

57:34.960 --> 57:38.320
You wanna see what I got?

57:38.360 --> 57:42.240
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.720
You seen this one?

57:47.600 --> 57:49.160
Get in the car.

57:49.280 --> 57:53.680
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.400
Oh, God, no!

58:13.440 --> 58:15.000
This is crazy!

58:15.800 --> 58:18.320
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

58:25.760 --> 58:29.960
Go ahead.

58:30.040 --> 58:32.320
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

58:32.400 --> 58:36.080
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

58:38.760 --> 58:42.440
I got you right where I want you.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.560
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

58:45.640 --> 58:49.000
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

59:00.720 --> 59:02.600
This isn't funny.

59:03.360 --> 59:06.760
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

59:06.840 --> 59:09.000
Every one of you is gonna burn.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.840
Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

59:12.920 --> 59:16.040
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

59:16.840 --> 59:20.320
<i>Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.</i>

59:20.400 --> 59:24.080
I told you to shut up.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.920
I can't see.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.960
What's happening?

59:34.440 --> 59:36.760
I can't see.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.440
I can't hear anything.

59:39.520 --> 59:42.840
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

59:42.880 --> 59:46.320
Make it quick, will you?

59:48.520 --> 59:51.080
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i>

59:53.720 --> 59:56.880
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i>

59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.160
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.280
<i>and going through their pockets,
divvying up cash when they find it.</i>

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.320
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.</i>

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.160
<i>His wallet is packed.</i>

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.040
<i>Mastercard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,</i>

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.280
<i>and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.160
<i>that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.</i>

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.000
<i>Then I find an atom bomb.</i>

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.480
<i>Jackie Boy,</i>

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.880
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.720
<i>There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,</i>

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.840
<i>I couldn't quite make out what she said.</i>

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.200
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop. "</i>

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.800
<i>She said "cop. "</i>

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.920
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.</i>

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.240
<i>Iron Jack, the papers call him.</i>

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.920
<i>A goddamn hero cop.</i>

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.040
<i>It's held for years, the shaky truce.</i>

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.960
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party.</i>

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.720
<i>The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.</i>

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.600
<i>They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood</i>

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.880
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,</i>

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.520
<i>but they send him back alive.</i>

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.600
<i>That's the rules.</i>

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.520
<i>That's the truce.</i>

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.000
<i>The cops stay out.</i>

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.080
<i>That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.</i>

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.000
<i>Old Town will be left wide open.</i>

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.960
<i>It'll be war.</i>

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.360
<i>The streets will run red with blood -</i>

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.680
<i>women's blood.</i>

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.040
The cops!
The mob!

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.760
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.520
The hell they will!
We got guns.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.560
We'll fight the cops and the mob

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.960
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.560
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.840
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.920
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.320
I'll hide the bodies.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.720
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.200
The cops know Rafferty came here.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.240
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.120
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.000
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.880
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.960
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.520
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.200
You got what you wanted out of me!

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.760
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.880
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.560
<i>Miho moves to my back.</i>

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.600
<i>One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.</i>

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.200
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.400
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.080
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.920
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.160
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.720
Get that gun out of my face now!

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.000
Bastard!

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.680
I forgot how quick you are.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.200
<i>My warrior woman.</i>

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.760
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off,</i>

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.960
<i>shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.</i>

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.320
<i>An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years</i>

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.520
<i>between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.</i>

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.040
A hardtop with a decent engine.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.400
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.360
I'll always love you, baby.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.200
Always... and never.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.880
Where'd you find that heap?

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.320
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.760
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.760
you think maybe I could go home?

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.840
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.040
Sure, Becky, go home.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.800
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.680
They'll never fit in that trunk.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.360
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.640
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.760
You'll catch cold if you don't.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.480
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.200
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.800
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.680
Hey, Mom?

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.080
<i>Dizzy dames.</i>

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.960
<i>What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?</i>

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.680
<i>We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,</i>

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.320
<i>we packed it so tight.</i>

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.120
<i>There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,</i>

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.920
<i>out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.</i>

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.800
<i>Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.</i>

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.560
<i>It'll help.</i>

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.240
It's got you smoking there, bud.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.520
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.680
You're dead.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.800
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:58.600
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.040
It's got you hearing things.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.120
It's got your nerves shot.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.680
It's got you smoking.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.560
You know it's true.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.120
Nobody ever really quits.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.200
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.000
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.880
Will you look at that?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.680
Those hookers let you down.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.840
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.000
You sucker for the babes, you.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.960
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.000
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.400
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.400
Watch it!

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.720
This is great.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.080
Just like being in a buddy movie.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.360
Shut up!

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.200
Boy, you're screwed.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.240
It's over.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.720
You're flushed.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.240
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.560
Sure, he's an asshole.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.160
Sure, he's dead.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.680
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.680
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.040
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.280
Not in this heap.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.760
Pull over!

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.600
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.000
Tough call.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.160
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:56.320
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.560
My hand moves all on its own,

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.480
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.240
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.320
Whatever you say.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.560
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.680
I'm the designated driver.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.279
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.359
I'll let you off with a warning.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.279
What next?

01:08:56.359 --> 01:09:00.920
<i>The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.</i>

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.840
<i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i>

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.000
<i>A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.</i>

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.319
<i>Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,</i>

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:14.439
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...</i>

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.399
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.040
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.760
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.040
Not tonight.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.800
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.040
Your cause is lost.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.800
We know everything.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.720
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.600
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.720
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.520
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.000
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.880
But it is within your power
to save many lives

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.160
by facilitating the process of transition,

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:21.360
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.360
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.320
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.360
I serve a new master now,

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.080
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.360
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.880
because, by now, he is surely dead.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.600
You don't know him.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.760
My man will find a way.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.800
He always finds a way.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.160
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.440
and going on about how they got it so bad.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.720
This is a fine, grand country.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.080
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.280
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.800
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.400
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.760
without shite to show for it.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.520
Yeesh.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.080
You find something, Murphy?

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.280
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.280
It's all bent up.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.080
What's this stuck in it?

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.160
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.520
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.000
<i>They weren't cops, these four.</i>

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.960
<i>They were mercenaries.</i>

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.240
<i>And if they were hired
by who I think they were,</i>

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.120
<i>the bad times haven't even started yet.</i>

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.520
<i>And everything seemed
to be going so well.</i>

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.960
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.240
You got a good point there, Ronnie.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.440
Lend me your knife.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.440
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.400
I'm at the bone, all right?

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.600
There we go.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.400
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.800
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.640
use your imagination, OK?

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.280
<i>Silence, now.</i>

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.640
<i>No air to breathe.</i>

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.640
<i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.</i>

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.000
<i>Let it in.
Let it fill your lungs.</i>

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.560
<i>They were counting on you
and you blew it.</i>

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.680
<i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i>

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.280
<i>Miho, you're an angel.</i>

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.200
<i>You're a saint.</i>

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.360
<i>You're Mother Teresa.</i>

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.400
<i>You're Elvis.</i>

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.640
<i>You're God.</i>

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.680
<i>And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i>

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.960
Dwight, they got Gail!

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.040
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.920
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.320
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.320
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.400
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.480
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.200
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i>

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.760
<i>We talk.</i>

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.080
<i>Stay smart.
Stay cool.</i>

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.480
<i>It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.</i>

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.560
<i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i>

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.000
<i>Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.</i>

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.480
There they are.
What do we do?

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.640
We stop 'em, Dallas.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.600
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.360
<i>I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.</i>

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.480
Get the head!

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080
I got it!

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.360
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.800
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i>

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.400
<i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done.</i>

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.360
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.040
Brave lad.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.800
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.480
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.760
You got the drop on me, love.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.240
I'm as helpless as a baby.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.680
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.560
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.160
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.200
It's my preference to blow things up.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.560
Once you blast the roof off a pub

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.280
and seen all the parts flying off people,

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.120
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.720
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.120
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.720
You killed me mates.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.080
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.040
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.520
<i>You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.</i>

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.280
<i>She twists the blade.</i>

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.040
<i>He feels it.</i>

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.360
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.</i>

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:02.720
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.</i>

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.600
<i>First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.</i>

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.480
<i>The big, fat kill.</i>

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.120
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.240
What, are you kidding me, man?

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.640
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.120
I mean, the man's an artist.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.120
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.040
Your skin is perfect.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.040
Your nerves, responsive.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.360
Beautiful.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.400
Just give them what they want, Gail.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.200
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.520
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.680
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.640
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.560
We gotta cut a deal.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.080
You little bitch!
You sold us out!

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.080
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.240
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.360
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.960
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.400
It wasn't your mom!

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.520
We could have protected her
and you know it.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.160
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.000
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.720
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.840
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.480
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.360
I had to watch out for my own neck.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.040
Your neck.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.080
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.920
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.760
Schutz, fetch my blades.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.720
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.440
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.920
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.320
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.920
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.800
There's something wrapped around it.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.520
Some kind of note.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.720
Give it to me.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.560
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.560
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.360
And bring the women.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.560
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.160
McCarthy, you fool.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.240
Guys?

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.600
<i>Dozens of them, armed to the teeth.</i>

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.480
<i>I'm outnumbered, outgunned.</i>

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.960
<i>But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.</i>

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.560
<i>They can't surround me.</i>

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.560
<i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight.</i>

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.080
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.640
Just give me the woman.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.600
Shut up.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.520
Dwight, don't do this.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.760
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.200
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.000
She's all yours.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.160
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.880
Dwight, what have you done?

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.920
Exactly what I had to.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.680
Every step of the way.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.000
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.400
How come there's tape over his mouth?

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.440
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i>

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:29.080
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:33.000
<i>But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.</i>

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.840
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.960
<i>The girls all know the score.</i>

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.360
<i>No escape, no surrender, no mercy.</i>

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.200
<i>We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.</i>

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.360
<i>Every last one.</i>

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.480
<i>Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,</i>

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.640
<i>not because it'll make
the world a better place.</i>

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.480
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.440
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses,</i>

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.640
<i>he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.</i>

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.760
<i>The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing</i>

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.000
<i>with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,</i>

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.320
<i>and so am I.</i>

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.000
<i>The fire, baby.</i>

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.760
<i>It'll burn us both.</i>

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.600
<i>There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,</i>

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.880
<i>my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.</i>

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.720
<i>You'll always be mine.</i>

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.880
<i>Always...</i>

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.560
<i>and never.</i>

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.440
Evenin', officer.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.360
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.760
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.280
You know who I am and what I can do.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:17.000
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.640
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.920
You blew my son's ear off.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.280
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.960
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.840
My boy.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.560
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.680
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.440
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.240
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.640
Power comes from lying.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.320
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.280
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.840
you've got 'em by the balls.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.200
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.120
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.440
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.240
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.120
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.760
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.760
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.920
Fix that heart condition of yours.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.200
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:50.600
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.960
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.680
disgraced, destroyed...

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.680
alone.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.440
Your wife?

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.680
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.680
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.240
They won't let me testify.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.480
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.280
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.800
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.240
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.320
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.800
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.040
They got it all backwards.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.640
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.160
But you'll always remember things right.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.240
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.640
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.680
Don't visit me.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.480
Don't write me.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.600
Don't even say my name.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.000
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.960
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia. "

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.360
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.640
I'll write you every week... for forever.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.400
Sure, kid.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.520
Now, run on home.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.880
It's not safe for you here.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.360
Bye, Nancy.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.840
I love you.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.760
John Hartigan.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.520
Mr. Law and Order.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.880
Mr. By the Book.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.040
Mr. High and Mighty.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.560
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.720
without it catching up with you.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.920
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.160
It's catching up with you but good.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.760
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.960
He's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.240
He's the picture of health.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.600
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.840
I rented her out of Old Town.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.400
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.800
You hear me, Hartigan?

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.400
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.200
you might just get some of Tammy.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.800
You see that?
She flinched.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.160
You make her sick.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.880
She heard about you and that little girl.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.120
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised
myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.</i>

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.440
<i>You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs.</i>

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.400
<i>Not in my book, you don't.</i>

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.800
<i>They want a confession.
They won't get it.</i>

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.520
<i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.</i>

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.520
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia,"
just like she promised.</i>

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.240
<i>She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.</i>

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.160
<i>At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two</i>

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.360
<i>before her young mind
moves on to better things.</i>

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.560
<i>But every Thursday, another one arrives.</i>

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.400
<i>What a sweet kid.</i>

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.680
<i>I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.</i>

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.960
<i>She's the only friend I've got -
the daughter I never had.</i>

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.000
<i>My sweet Cordelia.</i>

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.560
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.680
<i>Eight years pass.</i>

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.760
<i>Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,</i>

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.760
<i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i>

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.320
<i>only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,</i>

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.400
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.</i>

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.320
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i>

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.200
<i>Is she all right?</i>

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.600
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.040
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.680
<i>Two months now -
not a word from Nancy.</i>

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.040
<i>Did they find her?
Did they get to her?</i>

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.440
<i>Of course!
Stupid old man.</i>

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.960
<i>Do your math.
Nancy's 19 years old.</i>

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.440
<i>How long did you expect her
to keep writing?</i>

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.080
<i>She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.</i>

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.080
<i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i>

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.080
<i>You're alone.</i>

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.480
<i>You're all alone.</i>

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.360
<i>This guy smells awful -
like bad food.</i>

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:45.720
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.</i>

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.840
<i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i>

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.280
<i>Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.</i>

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.080
<i>When I come to, I see it.</i>

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.280
<i>The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,</i>

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.680
<i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i>

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.720
<i>There's something soft,</i>

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.560
<i>something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone</i>

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.520
<i>that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.</i>

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.640
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.440
<i>She was so careful.</i>

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.280
<i>She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.</i>

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.480
<i>I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.</i>

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:39.440
<i>Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride, either.</i>

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.000
<i>It's only one final surrender they want.</i>

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.640
<i>You got me, Roark.
You beat me.</i>

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.680
<i>I say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it.</i>

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.080
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.</i>

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.400
<i>I agree to everything they want from me.</i>

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.320
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:19.280
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:23.080
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.560
Christ.

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.360
Eight years.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.760
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.600
you made me hate myself.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.120
Any word from Eileen?

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:49.200
She got remarried four years ago.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:55.400
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.440
Don't be.

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.880
I'm glad.

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.040
Eileen always wanted kids.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.960
She'll make a good mother.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:11.000
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.640
<i>Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other,</i>

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.720
<i>then I go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -</i>

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.160
<i>Nancy.</i>

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:33.520
<i>How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?</i>

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.240
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.360
<i>And what have they done to you, baby?</i>

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.000
<i>Not a sound.</i>

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.680
<i>No sign of life.</i>

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.320
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,</i>

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:55.000
<i>like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.760
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.480
<i>It's like all she ever does
is read and study and write.</i>

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:05.640
<i>No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.</i>

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.440
<i>Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.</i>

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:15.560
<i>It's a long shot,
but maybe she's got some friends there.</i>

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.000
<i>A dead end.</i>

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.680
<i>Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this.</i>

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:31.480
<i>But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:34.480
<i>or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place.</i>

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.400
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.680
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.520
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.960
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.160
She's just warming up.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.680
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.560
<i>She grew up.</i>

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.440
<i>She filled out.</i>

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:10.000
<i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i>

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:14.800
<i>And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,</i>

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.520
<i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i>

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.240
<i>How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.</i>

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.520
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.040
<i>Then it hits me.</i>

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.240
<i>They were bluffing.</i>

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.880
<i>I've led them straight to her.</i>

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.680
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i>

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.200
<i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i>

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.920
<i>Lead the creep outside.</i>

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
<i>Get that Beretta away from him somehow,
and kill him.</i>

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.880
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.</i>

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.800
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i>

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.160
<i>No, Nancy.
Don't notice me.</i>

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.480
<i>Don't recognize me.</i>

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.760
There's no time to explain.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:27.680
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:30.040
We need to get out of here
right this second.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.840
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.480
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.840
Kept me going.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.280
Kept me from killing myself.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.840
Hurry up, will you?

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.000
- Maybe I should drive.
- Not a chance.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.440
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.520
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.480
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.800
It's loaded and it works.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.240
Yeah, this'll do.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.680
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.680
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.200
You've never been far from my thoughts.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.760
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.520
What are you talking about?

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.200
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.720
<i>She's counting on you, old man.</i>

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.480
What are you doing?

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.880
<i>Prove you're still worth a damn.</i>

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.160
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.440
<i>He's a decent shot.</i>

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.320
<i>He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.</i>

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.240
<i>Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.</i>

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.080
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i>

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.320
<i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.</i>

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.800
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.880
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.880
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:48.040
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:52.200
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.360
No!
Let me stay close.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.840
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.000
Please?
Let me stay close.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.880
<i>The stink - I almost gag.</i>

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.800
<i>His blood smells
even worse than he does.</i>

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.720
<i>- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.</i>

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.080
<i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i>

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.160
We're out of time.

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.480
<i>The sirens - I used to welcome the sound.</i>

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.800
<i>There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,</i>

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.440
<i>get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i>

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.920
<i>The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.</i>

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.600
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.480
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.720
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.400
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.920
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.480
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.040
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.040
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.880
<i>I've never been all that good with people.</i>

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:11.200
<i>When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,</i>

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.040
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i>

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.880
It's always been you, Hartigan.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.840
All these years.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.440
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.560
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.720
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.120
Eight years.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.720
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.880
It wasn't just gratitude.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.960
I tried to fall in love with boys.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.280
Even thought I did once or twice.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.200
But I was already in love... with you.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.880
That's enough.
Jesus Christ!

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.200
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.840
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.200
No.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.000
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.520
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.400
I love you.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.200
I love you, too.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.080
With all my heart.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:52.400
<i>Cold shower- it helps.</i>

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.680
No, Nancy.

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.240
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.000
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.720
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.640
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.000
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell.</i>

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.400
<i>I've been suckered
into betraying the only friend I've got,</i>

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.000
<i>and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist I thought I'd put down for good.</i>

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.120
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.</i>

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.120
<i>It's all gone to hell.</i>

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.080
Klump, it's me.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.880
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.840
I want you to set me up for a party.

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:37.280
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.120
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.560
My tools better be clean and sharp.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:45.320
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.440
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.120
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.840
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.920
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.200
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.120
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.280
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.080
I've been having the time of my life.

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:17.520
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.640
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.600
She left not a clue.

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:26.040
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.440
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.600
Nancy, don't scream.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.960
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.160
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.440
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.080
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.880
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.000
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.240
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.120
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.760
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.960
<i>This is it.
No way to fight it now.</i>

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.960
<i>No hope left.</i>

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.720
<i>No chance.</i>

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.480
<i>This is it.
This is the end.</i>

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.200
<i>No.</i>

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.880
<i>Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.</i>

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:34.640
<i>The window - maybe there's an alarm.</i>

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.280
<i>Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!</i>

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.040
<i>Stay conscious.</i>

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.240
<i>No alarm.</i>

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.000
<i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i>

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.760
<i>You can do it.</i>

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.440
It is inclement upon me

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:52.680
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:59.240
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:04.760
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:10.760
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.280
boner-inspiring though it may be -

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:18.040
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.600
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:32.480
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.160
In plain English, creep!

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.840
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.120
The farm!

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.800
<i>That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force</i>

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:48.800
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.</i>

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.080
<i>Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.</i>

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.160
<i>Once things get loud,
I'll probably have use for the cannons.</i>

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.080
<i>But at first, I'll have to play it quiet.</i>

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.280
<i>Quiet and nasty.</i>

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.080
<i>Nancy's car- six miles from the farm.</i>

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:06.280
<i>"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running, " she told me.</i>

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:09.680
<i>Good girl.
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard</i>

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.040
<i>and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.</i>

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.840
<i>You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.</i>

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.440
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.</i>

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.320
<i>But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.</i>

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.520
<i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i>

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.480
<i>Don't scream.</i>

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:30.920
<i>I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods.</i>

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.800
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i>

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.200
<i>My heart.
Can't be my heart.</i>

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.960
<i>I was cured.</i>

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.920
<i>Bad cough - blood in it.</i>

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.960
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:50.080
<i>I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.</i>

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.960
<i>Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet.</i>

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:05.600
<i>Hate yourself later.</i>

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.680
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.680
Do you think I'm tired?

01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.800
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:35.200
You're the one who's gonna crack!

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.160
You'll crack!

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.120
You'll cry and beg!

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.920
You'll scream!

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.520
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.840
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.800
That was foreplay.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.640
Hartigan was right about you.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.080
You can't get it up unless I scream.

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.360
You're pathetic!

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.640
You're pathetic.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.880
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:20.680
It brings out the worst in me.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.640
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.760
<i>In too much of a hurry.</i>

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.160
Damn!
It can't be!

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.000
<i>Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:40.320
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.400
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.720
Good advice.

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.680
Give it up, Junior.

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.640
It's over.
Let her go.

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.400
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.240
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.360
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.080
You can't even lift that cannon!

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.400
Sure, I can.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.600
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.480
Nancy, I'm sorry.

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:34.800
I'm taking no chances with you.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.600
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.040
Here it comes.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.320
It's gonna hurt.

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.320
You're right about that.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.880
Sucker.

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:01.760
<i>I take away his weapon.</i>

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.920
<i>Both of them.</i>

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.800
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.600
<i>After a while, all I'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,</i>

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:25.840
<i>so I stop.</i>

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.680
So long, Junior.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.200
Been a pleasure.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.720
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.600
I didn't scream.

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.720
I know it, baby.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.080
You grew up strong.

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.280
<i>By the time I get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking.</i>

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.120
<i>Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.</i>

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.560
Thanks for remembering my coat.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.800
And for all the little things.

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:15.840
Like saving my life, twice.

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.720
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:24.560
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:27.280
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.560
I'm gonna clear my name.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.520
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.080
I can't lose you, not again.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:42.240
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:58.080
<i>Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.</i>

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:03.720
<i>Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.</i>

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.240
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure.</i>

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:10.720
<i>And maybe after I've pulled off
that miracle, I'll go and punch out God.</i>

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:14.480
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.</i>

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.520
<i>I killed his only son.</i>

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:18.640
<i>The bloodline is cut.</i>

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:21.440
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.</i>

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:24.200
<i>He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.</i>

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.720
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.</i>

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:30.200
<i>There'll be no end to it.</i>

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.360
<i>She'll never be safe.</i>

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.960
<i>Not as long as I'm alive.</i>

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.520
<i>There's only one way to beat him.</i>

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.680
<i>An old man dies,</i>

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.880
<i>a young woman lives.</i>

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.120
<i>Fair trade.</i>

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.800
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.440
Yes.

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.800
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:07.840
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:11.320
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:13.640
It should be right as rain in no time.

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.320
<i>Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:39.720
<i>and you can find anything.</i>

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.400
Becky.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.920
Care for a smoke?

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.000
Love you, too, Mom.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:53.160
<i>Anything.</i>
