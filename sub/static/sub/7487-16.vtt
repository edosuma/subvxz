they'd investigate it.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.446

36:54.446 --> 36:56.680
You want me to help find
whoever did this,

36:56.682 --> 36:59.249
You want me to hand
that book full of suspects

36:59.251 --> 37:00.951
Over to the cops, i will.

37:00.953 --> 37:04.321
I will do
whatever you say.

37:04.323 --> 37:08.325
But just know that justice
for sue comes at a cost to abby.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.794
At a cost
to your family.

It's crazy --
i feel guilty.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.254
Dirty.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.772
I didn't do anything wrong. It
wasn't wrong to sleep with her,

37:56.775 --> 37:58.541
Not illegal.

37:58.543 --> 38:03.413
I refuse to engage in extortion
or let others do so.

38:03.415 --> 38:06.750
I didn't
slit her throat --

38:06.752 --> 38:10.820
A gory detail i wish the police
hadn't shared with me.

Above board.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.867
And yet...

38:23.869 --> 38:27.437
I still feel dirty.
I still feel culpable.

I still feel
like i can't help

in her murder.

I didn't stand up for her.
I didn't try to help her.

A young woman --
someone's daughter.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.951
I thought of her as just
some girl i called "kinky sue"

38:41.953 --> 38:46.489
And treated like a sexual
vending machine, which is...

38:50.762 --> 38:53.463
I didn't do anything
especially right, either.

that feeling?

what i'm talking about?

H-home.

I'm going home.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.488
What was she like?

39:18.490 --> 39:20.957
She was
a nice person --

39:20.959 --> 39:22.792
Smart and nice.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.895
Deeply, deeply...
Perverted,

39:25.897 --> 39:27.664
But also
smart and nice.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.132
She was
a very talented writer.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.935
I was sick once --
bad-flu sick.

Sue brought me chicken soup
and cough syrup.

I'm serious. Think about it.
Think about sue.
