WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:12.083
Whoo!

00:12.625 --> 00:14.458
That was refreshing, huh, friends?

00:16.709 --> 00:19.709
Yeah. You know, karate gives you
energy to burn.

00:19.792 --> 00:22.250
Don't believe me?
Just look at my students!

00:25.750 --> 00:27.959
Hey. Hey, karate man.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.417
I have a question.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.917
What is it, random stranger?

00:32.083 --> 00:36.750
Is it true that you can teach me
to break a board with my hands?

00:36.834 --> 00:38.417
Absolutely.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.542
One of my students will now show you.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.375
- Where's Jack?
- He's not here yet.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.250
- Kim?
- No show.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.041
- Can you do this?
- Absolutely not.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.417
<i>We'll be back in a minute.</i>

00:55.291 --> 00:56.250
Hey...

00:56.834 --> 00:57.959
Where have you two been?

00:58.041 --> 00:59.750
My demo started 20 minutes ago.

00:59.834 --> 01:02.000
I'm sorry, Rudy. I forgot
to set my alarm clock,

01:02.083 --> 01:03.333
and then I couldn't find my gi,

01:03.417 --> 01:05.542
and by the time I found it,
I missed the bus.

01:05.625 --> 01:07.041
I just didn't want to be here.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.667
You know what? It doesn't matter anyway.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.166
These people are obviously
not into karate.

01:19.709 --> 01:22.375
Hey, hey. Hey,
what are you doing here, Ty?

01:22.458 --> 01:23.458
This is my demo.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.583
Giving the crowd their first taste
of the Black Dragons.

01:26.667 --> 01:27.959
Savor the flavor.

01:28.041 --> 01:29.792
Mmm, spicy!

01:30.875 --> 01:33.583
No, no, no. Do not savor his flavor.

01:33.667 --> 01:34.959
It tastes bad.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.083
Like an old jellybean you found
stuck to a toilet.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.208
I'm guessing. I...

01:42.542 --> 01:44.000
Jack! Show him what you got.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.417
Ooh!

01:52.500 --> 01:54.750
- In your face, Ty!
- Really?

01:54.834 --> 01:56.375
Oh, Ryan!

02:08.750 --> 02:09.750
Wow!

02:10.542 --> 02:11.458
I mean...

02:11.542 --> 02:12.917
...wow.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.542
If I sign up for a year,
do I get a free gi?

02:17.625 --> 02:20.208
That's right. Sign up for greatness, red.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.875
No, no, no. Hey, hey.
Get your hands off him.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.291
This random stranger's mine.

02:23.417 --> 02:25.834
- Uh, no. He's coming with me.
- Uh, no, I said he's coming with me.

02:25.917 --> 02:26.959
He is coming with me.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.208
- No, he's mine!
- He is coming...

02:28.291 --> 02:29.333
Aah!

02:31.458 --> 02:32.458
- You can have him.
- No, no.

02:32.542 --> 02:33.750
You called him. You can have him.

02:33.834 --> 02:35.375
- Not interested at all.
- I don't want him.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.000
- You can have him!
- Dojo is totally full.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.709

03:22.333 --> 03:24.458
Come on, Rudy. It wasn't a total failure.

03:24.542 --> 03:27.083
Uh, Look. One person handed
in a membership form.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.291
Uh, Jack? It hasn't
even been filled out yet.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.709
It's just a drawing of Rudy
with a butt for a face.

03:33.667 --> 03:34.875
Give me that.

03:39.417 --> 03:42.834
You guys, this membership drive
was my chance to get more students

03:42.917 --> 03:45.041
so I could make something of this dojo.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.375
But you guys don't take me
or this place seriously.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.250
Come on, Rudy. That's not true.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.417
Hey, guys.

03:50.792 --> 03:53.250
Mr. Gower from the pet store
was wondering if his chimp

03:53.333 --> 03:55.417
could come back over
and wear Rudy's uniform again.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.166
What?

03:57.583 --> 03:59.709
You guys let a chimp wear my uniform?

04:00.083 --> 04:02.041
Rudy, it's hysterical.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.375
From the back, he looks just like you.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.083
The only difference is the tail nub.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.417
He doesn't have one.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.834
Unbelievable.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.834
Joan, what's up with the shorts?

04:14.917 --> 04:15.959
Oh, oh.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.166
The owner of the mall, old rat face,
is out of town,

04:18.250 --> 04:20.166
so I'm going all cas, you know?

04:20.250 --> 04:22.000
Shaved my legs
for the first time this year.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.792
Showing off the old Joanie ponies, huh?

04:27.500 --> 04:30.542
That was my Uncle Blake.
He's on his way to Seaford right now.

04:30.625 --> 04:33.417
- Great.
- No, not great.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.583
When I graduated from Seaford High,
he gave me money to go to business school,

04:36.667 --> 04:38.875
but instead I used the money
to buy this dojo.

04:38.959 --> 04:43.542
All these years, I let him think that
I'm this big successful businessman.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.667
I can't believe you lied to family.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.166
Lies are the glue
that keep families together.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.625
When my uncle gets here in an hour,
he's gonna find out what I really am.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.208
A joke.

04:55.625 --> 04:59.125
Just a two-bit, broken down,
nub-tailed sensei.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.583
We gotta find a way to help Rudy.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.542
I mean, it's about time
we're there when he needs us.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.291
Joan, can we get into your boss's office?

05:09.375 --> 05:11.417
Oh, sure. I'm headed that way right now.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.125
-
- Oh, no.

05:15.083 --> 05:16.166
Joan?

05:16.875 --> 05:19.375
When you shaved your legs,
you may have missed a spot in the back.

05:19.709 --> 05:20.583
Oh, no.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.625
That's what makes them ponies, huh?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.458
- This is never going to work.
- Yes, it will.

05:30.542 --> 05:33.291
All you have to do is pass yourself off
as the owner of the mall.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.291
Arms out!

05:35.792 --> 05:36.875
Belt off.

05:43.875 --> 05:46.083
Guys, this doesn't feel right.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.250
I'm your sensei.

05:47.291 --> 05:51.166
I should be creating an environment
of honesty, integrity.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.291
<i>Rudy, your uncle's here.</i>

05:52.417 --> 05:53.750
Lie like the wind, people!

05:55.083 --> 05:56.750
Wait! Where are my pants?

05:56.834 --> 05:58.333
Jerry, you were in charge of pants!

05:58.417 --> 06:00.125
Hey, this is not my fault, okay?

06:00.208 --> 06:02.667
You people should not trust me
with something as important as pants!

06:07.500 --> 06:08.792
Uncle Blake!

06:08.875 --> 06:10.333
Rudy!

06:10.583 --> 06:12.000
Uncle Blake!

06:12.083 --> 06:13.125
Rudy!

06:13.750 --> 06:15.750
Come and give your uncle a hug!

06:16.083 --> 06:17.500
Can't do that!

06:17.583 --> 06:20.667
Rudy, give your uncle a hug!

06:25.500 --> 06:26.959
All right, where's your pants?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.458
Uh...

06:29.542 --> 06:30.458
You know.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.041
It's business casual.

06:33.417 --> 06:34.458
<i>Yeah, uh...</i>

06:35.125 --> 06:39.333
See? This is your business, and...

06:39.417 --> 06:40.750
...here's your casual.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.250
Well, we should get going
and leave Seaford's

06:44.333 --> 06:46.834
most successful businessman
to do more great things.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.333
We just want to thank you
for your unbelievably

06:49.458 --> 06:51.166
generous contribution to our charity.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.417
- Yes, thank you.
- Appreciate it.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.959
Oh. Hang on, kids. What's the charity?

06:55.709 --> 06:56.709
Um...

06:57.291 --> 06:58.375
We raise money for, uh...

06:58.458 --> 06:59.458
- Orphans.
- Build homes.

06:59.542 --> 07:00.875
- Whales.
- To the runaways.

07:02.834 --> 07:05.709
Building homes for orphaned whales
so they don't run away.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.667
- Yeah, we should, we should go.
- Yeah.

07:13.458 --> 07:16.667
Look at you, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!

07:16.750 --> 07:20.000
I can't believe it.
You're the, the owner of a mall?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.250
I'm, I'm proud of you, kiddo.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.041
I got to admit, I was a little worried
about you as a kid.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.792
Thought you were a bit, uh...

07:29.208 --> 07:30.709
How you say... An idiot.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.125
But, uh, you must have got over
that whole karate phase, right?

07:36.208 --> 07:38.250
Yeah. Yep. Sure did.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.166
Stupid karate.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.542
Oh, excuse me, gentlemen.

07:44.291 --> 07:47.125
I'm Madonna Monroe, Rudy's secretary.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.375
Charmed.

07:48.917 --> 07:49.917
Don't mind me.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.083
I'm just going to be right here,
doing some secretary things.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.208
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.000
- Ms. Monroe?
- Oh, hmm?

08:02.083 --> 08:03.417
You're sharpening a pen, darling.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.500
Oh.

08:05.583 --> 08:06.834
Silly me.

08:06.917 --> 08:09.041
Maybe I should just do some filing.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.709
So, what brings you to Seaford?

08:21.792 --> 08:26.000
Well, you know, my company just bought
the chain of Circus Town Amusement Parks,

08:26.083 --> 08:27.792
and we're trying to work out
some of the kinks

08:27.875 --> 08:29.250
in the one here in California.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.500
Why don't you drive up tomorrow?
We'll have some lunch.

08:32.583 --> 08:33.792
- Oh, okay.
- What do you say?

08:34.125 --> 08:36.792
Just, uh, don't dress
business causal, kiddo.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.458
<i>Mail!</i>

08:41.750 --> 08:43.333
Hey, Rudy. Why aren't you over at the--

08:47.792 --> 08:49.583
She really hates junk mail.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.583
It's gonna be amazing.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.417
- Well, I can't wait.
- Hey, Uncle. Oh.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.625
Uh, sorry, I'll come back.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.083
No, no, Rudy, come on in.

09:01.166 --> 09:05.000
Daphne and Lloyd here were just gonna
fill me in on their exciting new idea

09:05.083 --> 09:07.291
- to bring the thrill back to Circus Town.
Yeah.

09:07.875 --> 09:11.000
We are planning an exciting new--

09:11.083 --> 09:12.291
Very exciting!

09:12.417 --> 09:13.250
Lloyd!

09:15.917 --> 09:20.291
An exciting new adventure
that allows kids to, get this,

09:20.417 --> 09:23.625
make their own candle.

09:23.709 --> 09:24.959
Whoo-ho-ho!

09:25.041 --> 09:26.166
<i>Hey.</i>

09:27.041 --> 09:28.667
We call it...

09:29.500 --> 09:31.625
the CandleMaker!

09:32.000 --> 09:34.834
One thrilling, waxy adventure.

09:34.917 --> 09:36.125
Kids are gonna love it.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.750
There's no way, no...

09:40.500 --> 09:41.625
Sorry.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.375
No, no, if you've got something to say,
just jump right in, please.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.583
I really shouldn't.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.583
But here's the thing. Um...

09:50.709 --> 09:53.500
Have either one of you ever
actually talked to a child?

09:53.583 --> 09:55.709
Oh, once, and it was horrible.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.500
I mean, circuses are supposed to be fun.

09:59.583 --> 10:00.625
Where's the fun?

10:00.709 --> 10:01.709
Kids have energy.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.917
They wanna run and jump and get crazy!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.375
Oh, no. No!

10:06.458 --> 10:07.792
- That is not in our research.
- No.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.250
I don't need research
to know what kids like.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.041
They like to break stuff!

10:14.125 --> 10:16.583
Why?
- Because it's fun!

10:17.250 --> 10:18.417
Come on, Lloyd.

10:19.041 --> 10:22.291
- Smash the diorama.
- Uh, we spent over 300 hours on this.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.542
- Just go for it.
- I don't think it's such a good idea--

10:24.625 --> 10:26.500
- Just do it!
-

10:28.250 --> 10:30.083
And how do you feel?

10:30.166 --> 10:31.291
Alive!

10:31.375 --> 10:33.041
And what are you gonna do now?

10:33.125 --> 10:35.750
I'm gonna buy a motorcycle
and hit the road!

10:36.417 --> 10:40.500
I'm calling off my wedding.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.375
I feel bad for his fiancée.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.083
It was me.

10:46.875 --> 10:47.875
Oh.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.375
So you're available.

10:53.041 --> 10:56.834
<i>♪ Hey, come on! Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

10:57.417 --> 10:58.333
Yo, guys.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.208
To make up for blowing
the membership drive,

11:01.291 --> 11:03.333
I got us some new students.

11:03.417 --> 11:06.041
You know, Jerry, every once in a while
you get a great idea.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.792
But this is not one of them.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.041
Can you help me?

11:16.125 --> 11:19.083
I, I think I put my jockstrap
on backwards.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.834
Not today, not ever.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.583
They don't exactly look like
they're cut out for karate.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.083
I'll handle this.

11:30.750 --> 11:34.625
Murray, Ruth, uh, why don't you guys
start out with some push-ups?

11:35.959 --> 11:38.625
He said we're gonna get
some of those Push Pops.

11:38.709 --> 11:40.500
Do they have cherry?

11:42.542 --> 11:43.709
Uh, forget the push-ups.

11:43.792 --> 11:45.542
Why don't you loosen up on the mini-tramp?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.375
<i>Whee!</i>

11:50.500 --> 11:52.458
Whee.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.208
Hey, Rudy. How was lunch with your uncle?

11:58.291 --> 11:59.291
Um...

12:00.458 --> 12:05.250
He said that I was a natural at business
and offered me a job.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.792
- What?
- Yeah.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.834
It pays over $200,000 a year,

12:10.917 --> 12:12.333
comes with a company car,

12:12.417 --> 12:15.375
and who is the old man who just
bounced himself out of his pants?

12:16.792 --> 12:19.417
<i>I've never felt so free, Ruth.</i>

12:19.500 --> 12:21.750
<i>You're going too high!</i>

12:23.875 --> 12:26.166
Rudy, this is an amazing opportunity.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.458
What are you gonna do?

12:27.542 --> 12:31.375
It's the kind of thing
that would change my life forever.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.125
Yeah. You gotta take that job.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.500
Yeah. You're right.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.792
I never thought
I would say these words, but...

12:43.834 --> 12:45.875
I guess it's time for me
to leave the dojo.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.667
I don't think
I will ever forget this moment.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.542
I told you, you were going too high!

12:59.000 --> 13:01.625
I'll take my Push Pop up here!

13:12.750 --> 13:15.208
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey! What's going on, man?

13:15.291 --> 13:18.625
Ah, my little Wasabi Warriors.

13:18.709 --> 13:20.750
Dude, you tricked out your throne.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.917
Yes. It's all part of my New Year's
resolution to never walk again.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.500
What are you doing here?

13:28.291 --> 13:30.959
I have come to see you
through these troubled times.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.959
To ease your mind about
losing your beloved sensei.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.834
Thanks, Bobby. That means a lot.

13:36.917 --> 13:37.834
Good, good, good.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.583
Well, now that you feel better,
you should know I've sold the dojo.

13:41.667 --> 13:42.875
Goodbye forever!

13:43.208 --> 13:45.542
- What?
- What... You sold it?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.166
But you promised Rudy
this would always be our dojo.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.458
Yes, and it will.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.542
I sold it to the only sensei
I could find in this town.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.083
Aha! Here he is now!

13:58.166 --> 13:59.291
What?

13:59.417 --> 14:02.917
He assures me
he will take very good care of you.

14:03.834 --> 14:04.917
Well, I'm off.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.041
I've got to go motorize my bathtub.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.083
A little what's up to you, Wasabi Worms.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.834
You'll find I'm a lot different
than your last sensei, Judy.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.834
Oh, snap. Yo, you see what he did?

14:20.917 --> 14:22.500
Yeah, dude. That's just plain--

14:22.583 --> 14:23.625
Not funny, dude.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.041
I'm not interested in being your friend.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.333
I've got lots of friends.

14:27.417 --> 14:28.625
Well, some friends.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.417
Truth is, I met a guy on Tuesday,
and it looks good.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.625
Look, Ty,
you've already got your own dojo.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.083
And now I've got two.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.125
With Rudy gone,
I'm the only sensei in town.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.667
Now, with me as your sensei,
you must be on guard 24 hours a day.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.583
You never know when you might
get rocked with a sneak attack!

14:46.667 --> 14:47.709
Oh. Ow!

14:50.583 --> 14:51.834
You will learn!

14:57.166 --> 15:03.083
And in conclusion, we'd like to apologize
for the animatronic crocodile mishap.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.375
While we can never replace your nose,

15:05.458 --> 15:09.166
we would like you to accept this coupon
for one free corn dog.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.041
- Could you read that back?
- Read what back?

15:13.125 --> 15:14.041
My letter.

15:14.125 --> 15:17.792
Oh, I'm not writing your letter.
I'm drawing pictures of firemen.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.542
I call this one "hot Scott". Whew!

15:22.792 --> 15:24.208
Would you put that away?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.500
Oh, okay.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.417
Hey, do you think the kids
are doing all right?

15:29.834 --> 15:33.083
Oh, are you kidding me?
I'm sure they're doing just great.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.500
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.250
Hang in there, guys.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.041
Let's show Ty
what the Wasabi Warriors are made of.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.208
They'll break any minute.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.709
The contract I signed with Bobby Wasabi
said I couldn't kick them out,

15:45.792 --> 15:48.083
but it didn't say anything
about them quitting.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.417
And once they quit,
then we can get rid of them.

15:53.542 --> 15:56.000
Not the same since you got hit
with that bo staff, are you?

15:56.083 --> 15:57.375
No, ma'am.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.625
- I'm going down.
- I'm out.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.458
- Sayonara.
- No.

16:03.375 --> 16:04.417
Jack.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.041
Wow, your focus is amazing!

16:07.125 --> 16:08.000
Oh, no.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.917
Yeah, that tuna and bologna sandwich
is starting to kick up.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.583
- What? No, no, no.
-

16:15.166 --> 16:16.583
- No, no.
-

16:17.834 --> 16:19.083
Five-minute break.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.375
Then we're gonna do sit-ups
until you puke.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.333
Why don't we just quit?

16:28.417 --> 16:30.125
Because we're not quitters.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.792
Dude, I hate Ty.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.333
Think there's any chance Rudy misses us?

16:34.417 --> 16:36.250
Well, let's go to his office and find out.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.625
I mean, he's gotta miss us
as much as we miss him, right?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.000
Maybe he'll want to come back.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.000
What if he's happy?

16:44.667 --> 16:45.792
I mean, he's given us so much

16:45.875 --> 16:48.291
that we can't go over there
and make him feel guilty about us.

16:48.834 --> 16:50.125
You know, Jack's right.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.125
That wouldn't be fair.

16:52.625 --> 16:53.917
Okay, Wasabi pact.

16:54.625 --> 16:58.166
If he's happy, we pretend we're happy.
No matter what.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.083
- Okay.
- Wasabi.

17:05.583 --> 17:08.083
- You know what? You know what? Just...
- Okay.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.542
Wasabi.

17:11.083 --> 17:14.125
<i>♪ Here we go, let's start the party!
Chop it up like it's karate ♪</i>

17:14.917 --> 17:17.208
Whoa, Rudy. Check out your office!

17:17.291 --> 17:19.417
- Whoa.
- Yeah. I know.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
Every time I turn around, it's a new perk.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.375
I just got this one today.

17:23.458 --> 17:26.125
It's the world's spinniest chair.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.208
Whee!

17:31.083 --> 17:32.959
And look, I got my own fro-yo machine.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.208
No way!

17:40.625 --> 17:42.500
Thanks.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.625
So, uh... looks like
you're pretty happy, huh, Rudy?

17:49.709 --> 17:53.500
Absolutely. This job is incredible.
I couldn't be happier.

17:53.917 --> 17:55.208
Great.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.000
So, how are things at the dojo?

17:59.083 --> 18:01.458
Uh, good. Really good.

18:01.542 --> 18:03.959
So, who'd Bobby bring in
to be the new sensei?

18:04.166 --> 18:07.792
I think you know him. It's Ty.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.291
- What?
- No, no, no.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.792
Uh, relax. He's changed.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.583
He's actually a pretty good sensei.
Right, guys?

18:12.667 --> 18:13.875
Yeah, it's true.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.208
He's even got me breaking boards
all over the place.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.959
- You?
- Wish I had a board to show you.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.417
I got one right here.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.375
Uh...

18:26.709 --> 18:28.709
Uh, okay.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.250
Look! A ninja!

18:33.291 --> 18:34.250
Oh...

18:36.166 --> 18:38.417
Whoa. Eddie, you just broke that board?

18:38.500 --> 18:39.625
I did?

18:40.458 --> 18:41.542
I did.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.458
I really did.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.083
I'm not stopping now.
I'm going for the desk!

18:47.166 --> 18:48.875
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

18:52.500 --> 18:53.834
This is humiliating.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.083
I can't believe Ty turned Jerry
into a dummy.

18:56.166 --> 18:57.875
I think he was born that way.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.250
Not that kind of dummy.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.417
That kind of dummy.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.583
I'm not enjoying this, bro.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.583
Really not.

19:06.834 --> 19:09.291
Hey, why do you think Ty ordered us
to drink all this water?

19:09.375 --> 19:11.291
He probably just wants us
to stay hydrated.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.166
I think he's starting to like us.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.709
Stick figure, mama's boy, on your feet.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.667
We have to determine
this dojo's weakest link.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.500
It's obviously one of you.

19:21.583 --> 19:25.166
You two are going to spar until
only one of you is left standing.

19:25.250 --> 19:28.166
Only the winner gets to use the bathroom.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.083
- So you're saying...
- That's right.

19:30.166 --> 19:33.166
You gotta fight for your right to potty.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.375
He's my best friend.
We're not going to resort to violence--

19:37.458 --> 19:39.000
-
- Oh!

19:40.625 --> 19:42.750
All right, Ty.
I think you're taking this too far.

19:42.834 --> 19:45.583
Is that what you think, Jack?
Here's what I think.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.041
You both trained under Rudy
who I don't recognize as a real sensei.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.458
So I'm stripping you of your black belts.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.625
What?

19:52.709 --> 19:56.500
You'll have to re-earn your rankings
starting with these white belts.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.125
Ty? You're gonna need a mop.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.458
We both lost.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.500
You never had any intention
of teaching us, did you?

20:11.792 --> 20:12.917
Not really.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.458
But I'm the only dojo in town.
So what are you gonna do about it?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.667
All right, Ty. You win. We quit.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.750
Yes! You hear that, Black Dragons?

20:26.792 --> 20:29.542
That is the end of the Wasabi Warriors!

20:34.875 --> 20:36.291
<i>Next time on</i> Kickin' It...

20:36.375 --> 20:39.500
We lost the dojo, Jack,
but I didn't think we'd lose each other.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.208
- Jerry got into Swathmore?
- Kind of.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.125
Whoo!

20:48.208 --> 20:49.542
Do you think Rudy's big news

20:49.625 --> 20:52.083
is that he wants to quit his job
and get his dojo back?

20:52.166 --> 20:54.542
My students against your students.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.000
Winner gets the dojo.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.250
The entire future of our dojo
rides on this.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.041
Meet Kofi Kingston.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.250
Guys, a little change of plans.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.834
Instead of winning the dojo back,

21:09.917 --> 21:11.166
looks I'm gonna die.
