Like, it takes it over the top.
How did you do this?

07:58.345 --> 08:00.846
- Once we flipped the script,
stopped yelling,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.414
and started selling,
it was easy.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.249
- What do you mean yelling?
Why was y'all yelling?

08:04.318 --> 08:05.884
Y'all was yelling at people?
- Oh, no.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.253
It was just all those confusing
numbers about recidivism.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.621
It was turning people off.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.890
Nobody wants to do math
on a Saturday.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.091
- Jorge, who told you that?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.159
'cause you don't
talk like that.

08:14.228 --> 08:15.460

didn't sign that shit yourself?

I got you signatures.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.618
- Nah, man, by communicating.
By connecting with them.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.188
- Oh, don't play with me.
Why the [bleep] are you here?

08:43.257 --> 08:44.890
'cause people like you
only do good shit

if they gonna think they're
gonna get something out of it.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.293

08:48.362 --> 08:50.195
I wanna be involved
in my community.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.531
I wanna help get
the community center opened.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.400
Even more than that,
I wanna teach a cooking class.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.903

destroy the community.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.916

09:10.984 --> 09:13.318
- I was a kid too.

09:13.387 --> 09:17.122
But [bleep] like you
destroyed my childhood.

09:17.190 --> 09:21.126
People like you sold
my brother crack.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.061
And he never kicked it.

09:23.130 --> 09:27.766
He tried for years,
but he never kicked that shit.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.367
And so then one day,

09:29.436 --> 09:32.370
he decided he wasn't gonna
wanna live no more.

09:32.439 --> 09:36.041
So you know what he did?
He f--

09:36.109 --> 09:38.476
he killed himself.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.714
- Veesy, I'm sorry.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.618

[bleep] your sorry, man.

No, thank you, nigga.
No, thank you.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.488
She's an example for all of us
to turn the hoods

15:57.557 --> 16:00.024
back into neighborhoods
and be neighborly.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.326
When I was growing up,

16:01.394 --> 16:03.261
if you did some
knucklehead stuff,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.163
you got your ass

16:06.800 --> 16:09.367

that is a neighborhood.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.171
And that's why this community
center is so important.

16:13.239 --> 16:17.075
Because it's a place for
the kids and the elderly to go

16:17.143 --> 16:20.945
to find love, to find hope,
to work out their aggressions,

16:21.014 --> 16:25.616
to talk to somebody about
the pressures of the streets.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.618
And it's gotta
be important to us.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.120
It has to be.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.756
'cause when they don't have
a place like this,

16:31.825 --> 16:34.659
they either wind up
doing 25 to life,

16:34.728 --> 16:37.095

17:14.868 --> 17:16.768
- Yo, tray, amazing job today.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.270
- Oh, hey, thank you.
Auntie. Auntie.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.341
- Tray, you were magnificent.
I am so proud of you.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.310
- You know
how to talk that shit.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.713
- Thank you, aunties.
- Oh, I love you.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.182
- I thought I told you
to stay away.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.919
- I just hope you ain't mad
at me for making that speech.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.621
- It was a'ight.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.523
But I just hope
that shit works.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.558
- Veesy. Veesy.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.393
- Tray, man.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.063
- Percy.
- Hey, that was very moving.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.497
It's tough break
with robert, though.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.765
- What you talking about?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.133
- Listen,
I needed board approval

17:49.202 --> 17:50.735
on some projects before,
right?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.437
Whenever they postpone
the vote,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.072
that means
they turned you down.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.606
- But I don't understand.
We won the people.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.341
- That's why they ain't wanna
sign it right now.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.343
They know they can't handle
no angry-ass crowd.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.978
- Well, maybe I need
to take a swing

18:01.047 --> 18:02.980
at the swing voter
before he leave.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.482
- Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.883
But we'll figured out
something else we can do,

18:05.952 --> 18:07.051
you know what I'm saying?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.753
<i> - ♪ here we go again ♪</i>

18:08.822 --> 18:12.056

19:03.243 --> 19:05.076
We gonna be [bleep] allies
or something?

19:05.145 --> 19:06.410
That's what we doing?

19:06.479 --> 19:09.981
Let me be very,
very clear with you.

19:11.284 --> 19:14.452
I will never fully forgive

19:14.521 --> 19:17.188
what you did to me
and my family.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.626
But I guess
this can be a start.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.830
- Thank you, veesy.
I appreciate that.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.700
- So you still wanna do
this [bleep] class or whatever?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.802
- You know I do.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.572
But, veesy, this is much bigger
than the community center,

19:34.641 --> 19:35.940
you know what I mean?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.308
You know how many
[bleep] families I hurt

19:37.377 --> 19:39.844
in this community,
including yours?

19:39.913 --> 19:43.080
I feel like I owe
to whole brooklyn.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.683
I'm just trying to give back
what I took.

from this angle,

20:20.853 --> 20:22.386
no one can tell it's you.

That's the hard part.
