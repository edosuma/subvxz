WEBVTT

00:08.170 --> 00:10.058
- STOP. STOP.
- FATHER.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.168
- STOP CALLING ME THAT.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.075
- YOU HAVE
TO TAKE IT EASY, FATHER.

00:13.110 --> 00:15.408
- SHAWN, WOULD YOU LET ME GO.
- BUILD UP YOUR STRENGTH.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.044
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW ANNOYING YOU ARE?

00:17.080 --> 00:19.571
CALLING ME FATHER, LIKE
IN SOME BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIE?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.042
- BUT I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU, FATHER.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.479
- HENRY, LET HIM HELP YOU.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.680
- I DON'T NEED ANY HELP WALKING.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.789
I'M FINE.

00:24.820 --> 00:26.811
BOTH OF YOU, JUST--
I'M FINE.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.158
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CLEANED THIS THING OUT?

00:29.190 --> 00:30.555
- LOOK, MOM, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO FLY ALL THE WAY HERE

00:30.590 --> 00:31.659
JUST FOR THIS.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.226
- IS THIS A CORN DOG?

00:33.260 --> 00:35.319
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.793
TAKE A BITE.
- I'M NOT BITING INTO THIS.

00:36.830 --> 00:39.094
- JUST GET A LITTLE BITI'Y BITE.
- NO, I DON'T WANT ANY.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.459
IT'S DISGUSTING.
NOW, I ONLY MADE A FEW MEALS.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.762
I'M ONLY HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.563
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO CHECK ON HIM.
- I GET IT.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.828
YOU WANT ME TO SWING BY,
MAKE SURE HE HAS FRESH WATER.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.576
YOU KNOW...

00:47.610 --> 00:49.168
CHANGE HIS COLOSTOMY BAG.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.848
- HE DOESN'T HAVE
A COLOSTOMY BAG.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.110
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
BECAUSE I THINK HE MIGHT.

00:53.150 --> 00:57.109
- GOOSE, DO YOU REALIZE
HE ALMOST DIED?

00:57.150 --> 00:58.845
- I'M SORRY, MOM.
I JUST--

00:58.890 --> 01:01.085
I CAN'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY WHILE
YOU'RE HOLDING THAT THING.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.553
- I KNOW YOU MAY FIND THIS HARD
TO BELIEVE,

01:02.590 --> 01:04.126
BUT SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA WANT
THESE TIMES BACK.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.718
MAYBE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE

01:05.760 --> 01:07.751
TO GET TO KNOW HIM
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.358
- MM, I DON'T KNOW IF I NEED
TO GET TO KNOW HIM

01:09.400 --> 01:10.424
IN ANY ADDITIONAL WAYS.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.461
I MEAN, THE ONE WAY SEEMS SOLID.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.560
IT SEEMS SUFFICIENT.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.636
I AM NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES.

01:17.670 --> 01:21.879
BUT I WILL TAKE YOUR WORDS
UNDER ADVISEMENT.

01:21.910 --> 01:26.142
- INSERT PLANK "J" INTO PEG "H."

01:26.180 --> 01:27.147
THERE IS NO PEG "H."

01:27.180 --> 01:28.477
PEG "H" DOESN'T EXIST.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.408
I AM GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.884
- YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO
TAKE A SWEDISH PRACTICAL JOKE.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.615
- YOU CAN GO HOME, SHAWN.
- I CAN'T.

01:34.660 --> 01:35.786
I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY I'M HERE.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.321
THERE'S A REASON.
IT'S THIS.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.397
JULES, I JUST HAD
A MAJOR EPIPHANY.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.658
- HMM.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.622
- YOU KNOW MY LEASE
IS ALMOST UP.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.898
- YES.

01:44.930 --> 01:48.798
I MAY HAVE BEEN VAGUELY AWARE
OF THAT FACT.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.638
- RIGHT, WELL, I'M THINKING,

01:51.670 --> 01:54.309
"SHAWN, IT'S TIME
TO MOVE FORWARD IN YOUR LIFE."

01:54.340 --> 01:56.740
AS A MAN, YOU KNOW.
- YEAH.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.873
- IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT ME ANYMORE.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.846
- I THINK THAT IS A VERY
MATURE THOUGHT, MR. SPENCER.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.687
- SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

02:04.720 --> 02:05.880
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

02:05.920 --> 02:09.788
- I AM GONNA MOVE IN.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.856
WITH MY DAD.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.856
MMM.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.198
- [clears throat] SHAWN.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

02:17.230 --> 02:19.334
HOW MANY MORE TIMES
IS MY FATHER GONNA BE RECOVERING

02:19.370 --> 02:21.292
FROM A GUNSHOT WOUND
IN MY LIFETIME?

02:21.340 --> 02:25.709
MAYBE ONCE.
MAYBE, IF I'M LUCKY. HA.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.674
WHAT?
YOU'RE COOL, RIGHT?

02:27.710 --> 02:29.302
DON'T LIE TO ME,

02:29.350 --> 02:30.647
BECAUSE I CAN ALWAYS TELL
WHEN YOU'RE LYING.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.274
- OH, I AM SO COOL, SHAWN.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.311
- OH, GOOD. WHEW.
- YEAH.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.841
- FOR A SECOND,
YOU HAD ME WORRIED THERE.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.367
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:50.400 --> 02:52.197
- LOOK, IT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.798
I'M JUST TAKING
ADDITIONAL PHOTOS

02:53.840 --> 02:56.832
FOR MY SOULMATECONNECT.COM
ONLINE DATING PROFILE.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.406
- WHEW.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.634
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING
TRULY EMBARRASSING

02:59.680 --> 03:00.829
GOING ON IN HERE.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.246
- LOOK, I NEED
TO BE IN LOVE, SHAWN.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.645
EVERYONE I'VE GONE AFI'ER
DURING THE LAST YEAR

03:04.680 --> 03:06.773
HAS EITHER BEEN A KILLER
OR DATING A KILLER.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.879
- OH, WELL, BY ALL MEANS,
LET'S SCOUR THE INTERNET--

03:08.920 --> 03:10.342
THE PLACE WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS

03:10.390 --> 03:12.278
IT'S JUST DECENT, NORMAL,
SANE PEOPLE

03:12.320 --> 03:13.912
LOOKING FOR TRUE LOVE.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.712
- YOU THINK YOU KNOW SO MUCH,
SHAWN.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.784
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.628
BOOM.
SHE'S PERFECT.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.367
SHE'S LIKE AN INDIAN PRINCESS
WHO BAKES PIES.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.469
AND I HAVE A DATE WITH HER.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.422
SO...
* SUCK IT

03:25.470 --> 03:28.439
- BUDDY, YOU KNOW
I'M IN YOUR CORNER, RIGHT?

03:28.470 --> 03:31.007
BUT EVERYONE LIES
ON THESE THINGS.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.372
OF COURSE, SHE LOOKS
ALL PRE'ITY ONLINE.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.877
WHEN YOU SHOW UP
AT THE RESTAURANT,

03:34.910 --> 03:36.878
GUESS WHO'S WAVING AT YOU
FROM THE BAR?

03:36.910 --> 03:38.901
THE NEW DELHI VERSION
OF COLONEL SANDERS, WITH A WIG.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.918
- AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
ON A SUNDAY, ANYWAY, SHAWN?

03:40.950 --> 03:42.588
I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PRIVACY.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.644
- I NEED
TO BORROW YOUR SUITCASE.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.782
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOURS?

03:44.820 --> 03:46.253
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:46.290 --> 03:47.609
- YOURS HAS WHEELS,
AND THE ZIPPER WORKS.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.548
AND I'M MOVING IN WITH MY DAD.

03:49.590 --> 03:50.625
- YOU'RE DOING WHAT NOW?

03:50.660 --> 03:51.957
DOES JULIET KNOW ABOUT THIS?

03:51.990 --> 03:52.922
- YEAH, I TOLD HER LAST NIGHT.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.518
- AND YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?

03:54.560 --> 03:56.790
- GUS, MY DAD WAS SHOT.
- MM-HMM.

03:56.830 --> 03:57.899
- OKAY, HE'S GONNA NEED HELP

03:57.930 --> 03:59.739
DOING NORMAL,
EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.988
- RIGHT.
- JULIET UNDERSTANDS THAT.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.009
SHE KNOWS THAT SOMEDAY,
EVENTUALLY,

04:05.040 --> 04:07.907
WE WILL MOVE IN TOGETHER.
YOU DON'T KNOW HER LIKE I DO.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.340
SHE'S NOT A REACTIVE PERSON.
SHE'S COOL.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.506
- JULIET IS COOL.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.347
- YEAH, SHE'S COOL LIKE THAT.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.917
- BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HELENE
IS BACK ON THE MARKET,

04:15.950 --> 04:18.339
LIKE THAT.
- HELENE?

04:22.860 --> 04:24.350
WH--

04:24.390 --> 04:28.292
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:28.330 --> 04:29.820
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:29.870 --> 04:31.565
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

04:31.600 --> 04:32.965
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:33.000 --> 04:34.536
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:34.570 --> 04:35.832
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:35.870 --> 04:37.838
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:37.870 --> 04:39.531
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:39.580 --> 04:42.674
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

04:42.710 --> 04:44.405
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:48.480 --> 04:50.414
- OKAY, UM, WELL,
I GUESS I BECAME FASCINATED

04:50.450 --> 04:51.781
WITH SEA HORSES
WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.412
BUT THEN I BECAME
VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THEM

04:53.460 --> 04:54.609
IN MY 20$.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.958
UH, LITTLE KNOWN FACT --
YOU KNOW,

04:56.990 --> 04:58.685
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WEAR SADDLES
LIKE THEY DO IN CARTOONS.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.595
[laughter]

05:00.630 --> 05:04.623
- CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?
- SURE.

05:04.670 --> 05:08.766
- THIS IS A PHOTO OF ME

05:08.800 --> 05:10.836
WITH MY LONG-SNOUTED
SEA HORSE.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.531
HIS NAME IS HERSCHEL.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.673
_ OH, GREAT NAME.
_ THANKS. [clears throat]

05:14.710 --> 05:15.938
HE'S SORT OF LIKE
THE GRANDPA OF THE GROUP.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.574
HE'S GOT A VERY FRAGILE
LOWER G.I. SYSTEM.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.441
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL,
ACTUALLY,

05:20.480 --> 05:21.913
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT OMNIVORES,
LIKE SOME PEOPLE THINK.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.986
THEY'RE ACTUALLY HERBIVORES,
BUT--

05:24.020 --> 05:25.885
OH, SIR! SIR! SIR!

05:25.920 --> 05:27.615
SIR, EXCUSE ME!
WHAT THE HELL?

05:27.660 --> 05:31.448
- OH, GEE, I'M SORRY.
HELLO, HELENE.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.651
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.122
- WHO IS THIS GUY?
- WHO AM I?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.492
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M THE BOYFRIEND,

05:37.530 --> 05:39.930
SO STOP STARING CREEPILY
INTO HER GREEN EYES, JACK.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.858
- OH, ACTUALLY, MY NAME'S MIKE.
- MY EYES ARE BLUE.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.003
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM.

05:43.040 --> 05:47.477
- MIKE, THIS IS MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.944
- EX? OH, THAT'S HOW
WE'RE GONNA PLAY THIS.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.710
OH, COME ON!
HE'S NOT EVEN GOOD-LOOKING.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.810
I MEAN, HE'S--IT'S OKAY.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.909
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT GREAT, I'M SORRY.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.952
IT'S NOT.
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SORRY.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.651
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

06:01.690 --> 06:03.521
- YOU HAVE GOT
TO EFFING BE KIDDING ME.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.857
MCNAB!

06:04.890 --> 06:06.949
GET OUT THERE
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.491
- OH, I WISH I COULD, SIR,
BUT I'M IN THE WEEDS RIGHT NOW.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.964
- YOU GET--
GET SPENCER OUT OF THERE

06:12.000 --> 06:15.834
BEFORE HE BLOWS
THIS WHOLE DAMN THING! GO!

06:15.870 --> 06:18.509
LEAVE THE SPAGHE'I'I'I!

06:18.540 --> 06:20.531
- I'M SORRY, MICHAEL.
MY EX-BOYFRIEND,

06:20.580 --> 06:22.901
HE'S A LITTLE UNBALANCED,
VERY IMMATURE.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.679
HE JUST MOVED BACK HOME.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.904
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA PLAY
DIRTY BALL, HUH?

06:25.950 --> 06:27.542
WE'RE GONNA PLAY
OLD-SCHOOL NASTY BALL?

06:27.580 --> 06:29.548
WELL, GOOD LUCK
FINDING MORE GARLIC STICKS.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.013
WHAT? WHAT?

06:32.050 --> 06:34.553
MCNAB?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:34.590 --> 06:36.922
- THIS IS MY TABLE.
- THIS IS YOUR--

06:47.770 --> 06:49.067
HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:49.100 --> 06:50.863
I'VE HAD SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS,

06:50.910 --> 06:53.936
AND, UH,
I'M WAY OUT OF LINE HERE.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.175
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

06:58.810 --> 07:00.971
- THANK YOU.
- DESSERT'S GONNA BE ON ME.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.909
I'M GONNA GO HIT MY SIDEWORK,
MARRY SOME KETCHUPS.

07:03.950 --> 07:05.986
WE HAVE
A CHOCOLATE FLOURLESS CAKE,

07:06.020 --> 07:07.658
LIKE EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT
ON THE PLANET,

07:07.690 --> 07:08.987
BUT OURS REALLY IS AMAZING.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.124
IT REALLY IS,
AND IT'S COMING YOUR WAY.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.889
YOU DON'T WORK HERE, MCNAB.
- NOT YET.

07:12.930 --> 07:15.125
- LASSIE, I NEED A FLOURLESS
CHOCOLATE CAKE, ON THE FLY.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.923
- GOOD GOING, SPENCER.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.028
YOU MAY HAVE
JUST BLOWN O'HARA'S COVER

07:18.070 --> 07:18.923
AND SIX WEEKS WORTH OF WORK.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.631
- SO, NO CAKE?

07:20.670 --> 07:21.989
- OKAY, LISTEN UP.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.234
IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS,

07:23.270 --> 07:26.205
TWO WOMEN IN THEIR LATE 20$
WERE KILLED.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.879
BOTH OF THESE WOMEN
WERE STRANGLED,

07:28.910 --> 07:31.777
THEIR BODIES BOTH FOUND
IN A DENSE WOODED AREA.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.870
HOWEVER, WE WERE UNABLE
TO FIND ANY OTHER EVIDENCE

07:34.920 --> 07:37.639
WHICH CONNECTED THESE TWO WOMEN.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.954
UNTIL WE FOUND THIS.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.617
- [whistles]

07:43.060 --> 07:44.982
- BOTH OF THESE WOMEN
HAD PROFILES

07:45.030 --> 07:48.522
ON THE DATING SITE
SOULMATECONNECTION.COM

07:48.560 --> 07:50.061
NOW, IN ADDITION,

07:50.100 --> 07:55.037
THEY DATED A CROSS SECTION
OF THESE SIX MEN IN COMMON.

07:55.070 --> 07:56.230
SO WE BELIEVE
THAT ONE OF THESE MEN

07:56.270 --> 07:57.862
IS THE POSSIBLE KILLER.

07:57.910 --> 08:01.175
SO WE SENT DETECTIVE O'HARA
UNDERCOVER

08:01.210 --> 08:02.848
TO HELP DRAW THESE MEN OUT.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.871
[solitary applause]
- BO'I'I'OM LINE.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.207
GREAT NEWS, PEOPLE.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.275
ALLOW ME TO CLARIFY, CHIEF.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.811
WHAT I MEAN
TO SAY IS SIMPLY THAT

08:10.850 --> 08:12.681
THANK GOODNESS
IT TURNS OUT

08:12.720 --> 08:15.154
IT MIGHT JUST BE A MANIACAL
SERIAL KILLER ON THE PROWL

08:15.190 --> 08:18.557
AND NOT THAT DETECTIVE O'HARA
WAS TRULY OUT THERE

08:18.590 --> 08:19.921
DATING STRANGE MEN.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.052
- SHAWN, I HAVE ANOTHER DATE
TOMORROW.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.522
- ARE YOU INSANE?

08:22.570 --> 08:23.719
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?

08:23.770 --> 08:24.998
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

08:25.030 --> 08:25.860
YOU WENT ON
A TELEVISION DATING SHOW

08:25.900 --> 08:27.697
AND MADE IT TO THE FINALE.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.038
- BECAUSE I AM A MAN!
AND I DO WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE!

08:30.070 --> 08:33.301
- OKAY, ENOUGH, THE TWO OF YOU.
- AND DON'T GET ME WRONG.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.979
IT'S NOT THAT DETECTIVE O'HARA
HASN'T DONE A BANG-UP JOB

08:36.010 --> 08:38.843
JEZEBEL-ING HERSELF OUT
TO HALF OF SANTA BARBARA.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.848
BUT IT WOULD APPEAR TO ME

08:40.880 --> 08:43.019
THAT YOU ARE DEALING PRIMARILY
WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

08:43.050 --> 08:44.847
SO, CHIEF, YOU ARE GOING
TO NEED ME TO COME IN HERE

08:44.890 --> 08:47.188
AND READ THESE MEN.
- OR ASSAULT THEM.

08:47.220 --> 08:51.020
- PULLING NEEDLES OUT OF
HAYSTACKS IS SHAWN'S SPECIALTY.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.994
SO...

08:53.030 --> 08:55.749
YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.225
- HEY, DUDE!

08:59.270 --> 09:01.033
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I NEED YOU.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.901
THERE'S MAJOR STUFF GOING DOWN
ON THE JULES FRONT.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.305
YOU JUST ABANDON ME
IN THE FIELD NOW?

09:04.340 --> 09:05.898
THAT'S YOUR NEW THING?

09:05.940 --> 09:07.077
WHAT?

09:07.110 --> 09:08.805
- SHAWN, THIS IS RACHEL.
- HI.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.308
- RACHEL, THIS IS SHAWN.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.908
- AH, YES.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.838
YOUR THE GIRL FROM THE INTERNET

09:14.880 --> 09:16.939
WITH THE PICTURE IN THE THING.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.287
SHE KNOWS WHO I AM.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.912
- IS THIS A FRIEND OF YOURS?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.689
- FRIEND?
BEST FRIENDS.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.926
FROM CHILDBIRTH.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.587
ACTUALLY, FROM BEFORE
WE WERE BOTH BORN.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.983
WE TOOK OUR FIRST POOPS
TOGETHER.

09:26.030 --> 09:27.258
- WHAT?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.949
- MINE WAS ADORABLE.
HIS WAS WAY TOO FORMED.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.763
- SEE, I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING

09:30.800 --> 09:33.132
YOU WERE HOLDING OUT
ON ME FROM THAT BABY ALBUM.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.138
- WAIT A MINUTE.
HE SHOWED YOU HIS BABY ALBUM?

09:35.170 --> 09:36.660
- HE'S KIDDING.
ABOUT THE POOP.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.063
HE KIDS,
USUALLY INAPPROPRIATELY.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.975
- AS INAPPROPRIATE AS YOU
LAST NIGHT,

09:40.010 --> 09:42.205
TELLING THAT WAITRESS SHE LOOKED
A YOUNG ELEANOR ROOSEVELT?

09:42.240 --> 09:45.846
[laughter]

09:45.880 --> 09:47.814
- WELL, IT WAS LOADS OF FUN
FOR EVERYONE.

09:47.850 --> 09:50.387
BUT, UH, GUS AND I HAVE
TO ATTEND

09:50.420 --> 09:52.684
TO SOME SERIOUS MATTERS NOW,
RACHEL.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.153
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND...

09:54.190 --> 09:56.750
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU WALKED OR DROVE OR WHAT,

09:56.790 --> 09:58.985
BUT IT'S A LOVELY JAUNT
DOWN THE BEACH PATH

09:59.030 --> 10:02.090
BACK TO WHEREVER IT WAS
YOU CAME FROM.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.269
DID YOU HAVE A JACKET?
- SHAWN.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.133
- I THINK THE DATE
IS STILL GOING.

10:07.170 --> 10:08.797
[snaps fingers]
- OH, I GET IT.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.934
YOU GUYS NEED
TO SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES. OKAY.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.403
FIRST DATE, LAST DATE.
I'LL WAIT.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.998
- I THINK THE FIRST DATE
WAS LAST NIGHT, SHAWN.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.940
TECHNICALLY,
THIS IS THE SECOND, NO?

10:16.980 --> 10:18.902
- TECH NICALLY,
YOU WOULD BE RIGHT,

10:18.950 --> 10:23.683
SO, TECHNICALLY,
THIS WOULDN'T BE INAPPROPRIATE.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.755
- MMM.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.087
- WAIT A MINUTE.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.122
YOU GUYS DIDN'T--

10:30.160 --> 10:32.890
- WHAT? WHAT--

10:35.300 --> 10:38.064
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I USED THE "DO IT" SYMBOL.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.068
DON'T WORRY.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.761
- I KNOW WHAT
THE DO IT SYMBOL MEANS.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.233
I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT
SINCE I WAS 12.

10:43.270 --> 10:45.101
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS--

10:45.140 --> 10:48.177
[laughs] WHAT IS
THIS GESTURE SUPPOSED TO BE?

10:48.210 --> 10:50.098
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME, MAN.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.947
THAT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
INTO THIS CHICK?

10:51.980 --> 10:53.140
- SHE IS AMAZING, SHAWN.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.740
SHE IS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.088
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.883
- I KNOW SHE WENT TO OXFORD,
IS A NUTRITIONIST,

11:00.490 --> 11:02.048
FROM THE BRITISH HEAVENS.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.057
- BRITISH DON'T GET
THEIR OWN HEAVEN.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.387
- SHE IS DIFFERENT, SHAWN.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.057
SHE'S NOT LIKE ANY
OF THE OTHERS.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.193
- REALLY? BECAUSE
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

11:07.230 --> 11:10.199
- SHAWN,
I THINK SHE COULD BE THE ONE.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.961
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
SHE'S THE ONE FOR US.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.969
- REA_LLY?
- [whines]

11:18.870 --> 11:20.030
OW!

11:20.080 --> 11:21.331
[click]

11:21.380 --> 11:24.349
GUS, DON'T BE THE "B"
FROM APARTMENT 23!

11:24.380 --> 11:27.474
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT!
WE'RE ALL BETTER THAN THAT!

11:27.520 --> 11:30.080
AT LEAST, I THINK WE ARE.

11:31.020 --> 11:36.879
- [mouthing]

11:36.930 --> 11:39.319
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU, POP?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.492
- YOU WANNA HELP?

11:43.530 --> 11:45.361
GO CLEAN OUT THE GARAGE.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.163
- HOW ABOUT YOU LET ME BORROW
THE TRUCK INSTEAD?

11:47.200 --> 11:49.839
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT TIME ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK?

11:49.870 --> 11:51.963
- IT'S A DATE WITH JULES.
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.898
HENRY, LET HIM BORROW THE TRUCK.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.305
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.046
- OH, IT'S ACTUALLY NOT MY DATE.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.240
I HAVE TO GO
TO A DATE

11:58.280 --> 12:00.976
THAT JULIET IS HAVING
WITH ANOTHER DUDE.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.318
IT'S A LONG STORY, GUYS.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.079
BUT DON'T WORRY, THERE'S
NO TOUCHING ABOVE THE KNEES

12:05.120 --> 12:07.918
AND ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THIS.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.952
- WHAT?
IS THAT OPENING A CAN?

12:10.990 --> 12:14.153
- [laughs] MOM.
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.221
- I WANT IT BACK BY MIDNIGHT.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.795
- WHAT AM I, CINDERELLA?
- YOU WANT TO MAKE IT 11:30?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.762
- NO.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.079
- OH, HEY, MOM, WHAT TIME'S
YOUR FLIGHT TOMORROW?

12:29.110 --> 12:30.998
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.
- ACTUALLY, THOSE BAGS

12:31.050 --> 12:32.199
ARE GOING UPSTAIRS.
YOUR MOTHER'S GONNA STICK AROUND

12:32.250 --> 12:33.945
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.311
- JUST FOR A WHILE.
MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.

12:35.350 --> 12:38.114
- I TOLD HER THAT I'LL BE FINE.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.914
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE MOVING IN?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.155
OH, MY GOD.

12:43.190 --> 12:46.057
I'M LIVING WITH MY PARENTS.

12:46.090 --> 12:49.867
[crowd murmuring]

12:55.140 --> 12:56.232
- ALL RIGHT,
THE MOVIE SHOULD BE OUT.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.908
WE'RE BACK UP AND RUNNING.

12:57.940 --> 13:01.432
- ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS WORK TIME.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.971
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT THAT OUT OF ME.

13:04.010 --> 13:05.500
I USUALLY DON'T TELL PEOPLE
I'M A MENSA MEMBER.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.370
AND THEY WON'T TO PLAY ME
IN "WORDS WITH FRIENDS."

13:07.420 --> 13:10.082
- OH, I AM SO NOT INTIMIDATED
BY THAT.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.519
I BET I COULD GIVE YOU
A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.359
- THERE'S A LOT OF HEAT
COMING OFF THESE TWO.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.858
- JULES IS A MUCH BETTER ACTRESS
THAN I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR...

13:15.890 --> 13:18.029
PRETENDING TO BE INTO
THIS LORDAN JOKER--COME ON.

13:18.060 --> 13:19.220
- PLEASE, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS VAN

13:19.260 --> 13:20.989
WHO ISN'T INTO THIS GUY.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.327
- [flat]
OH, HA, HA.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.964
- OH, COME ON.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.127
YOU KNOW THAT GIRLS
ARE BETTER SPELLERS THAN GUYS.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.990
- REALLY? 'CAUSE I HAVE WON
EVERY SPELLING BEE

13:28.040 --> 13:29.337
I HAVE EVER BEEN IN.

13:29.370 --> 13:30.906
- OH, SO YOU'RE A NERD.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.498
- SPELL "XYLOPHONE."
- WOW.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.031
_ IIXII__
- WOW.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.275
SO THIS IS HOW
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY MY BOY?

13:37.310 --> 13:38.868
- IS THAT GUSTER?

13:38.910 --> 13:40.138
YOU DIDN'T TELL GUSTER
ABOUT THIS?

13:40.180 --> 13:42.068
HE'S GONNA RUIN
THE WHOLE OPERATION.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.011
- UH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.359
[whispers] I DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS IS, REALLY.

13:48.390 --> 13:50.950
- OH, OKAY.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.389
I SEE HOW THIS IS.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.091
GIRL, THAT IS COLD.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.620
AND IF I WASN'T
ON A DATE MYSELF RIGHT NOW,

13:55.660 --> 13:59.938
WE WOULD BE HAVING WORDS.
KNOW THAT.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.528
[slurps]

14:01.570 --> 14:03.106
_ THAT'S MY BOY RIGHT THERE,
SON.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.904
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
WHO--

14:05.940 --> 14:08.477
WHO CAME UP WITH THESE PANIC
CODE WORDS FOR JULES, HUH?

14:08.510 --> 14:12.207
"I FEEL HOT"?
- WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER?

14:12.250 --> 14:14.639
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, HOW ABOUT
SOMETHING SEMI-CONVERSATIONAL,

14:14.680 --> 14:16.079
LIKE "YOU HAVE A BUTT CHIN"?

14:16.120 --> 14:18.384
- WELL, HERE WE ARE.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.058
THE END OF THE DATE GOOD-BYE.

14:20.090 --> 14:21.455
- MMM.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.527
- NOW I KNOW THAT THIS
IS A BIT STRANGE,

14:24.560 --> 14:25.925
BUT I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.949
- OH?
- OKAY.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.195
NOW I NEED YOU TO TURN AROUND.

14:29.230 --> 14:32.063
- OH, NO.
- COME ON, COME ON.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.364
- SURPRISE.
- JUST PLAY ALONG...PLAY ALONG.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.197
- SHE NEEDS US.
LET'S BOUNCE.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.434
- NO, NO, NO.
HOLD UP.

14:37.470 --> 14:39.006
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.031
WE GO OUT TO SOON,
WE BLOW HER COVER.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.900
- COME ON, COME ON,
JUST PLAY ALONG.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.042
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.275
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I--
- UH-UH-UH-UH.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.972
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN THE SURPRISE.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.113
OKAY.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.152
NOW, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.652
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FEEL HOT.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.965
VERY HOT.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.319
- [grunts]

15:08.400 --> 15:10.209
- GET OUTTA THE WAY!

15:10.240 --> 15:12.037
[overlapping shouting]

15:20.150 --> 15:22.448
[background chatter,
commotion]

15:22.480 --> 15:23.981
- YAH'
- HEY!

15:24.020 --> 15:25.988
- A NECKLACE?

15:26.020 --> 15:28.079
- YOU SAID ON YOUR PROFILE
THAT YOU LIKED TURTLES.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.951
- [laughs]
- IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE ONES

15:29.990 --> 15:32.129
I SAW ON MY TRIP
TO THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.698
- WOW, THAT IS UNEXPECT ED.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:35.730 --> 15:38.460
SO YOU SAID
YOU WERE FEELING HOT?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.161
- OH, YEAH, I, UH--

15:40.200 --> 15:42.464
UH, I AM FEELING COLD!

15:42.500 --> 15:45.298
I AM FEELING REALLY COLD.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.729
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET YOUR MEAT HOOKS OFF OF ME.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.338
- YOU WANT TO BLOW HER COVER?
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME.

15:49.380 --> 15:53.009
COME ON, SELL IT!

15:53.050 --> 15:54.347
RUB MY BACK AT A MEDIUM PACE.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.644
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- MAKE IT TENDER.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.988
- I'M BEING TENDER!

16:00.020 --> 16:03.148
- WAIT. THIS JUST IN.

16:03.190 --> 16:04.225
- OH.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.080
- LOVE IS IN THE AIR, HUH?

16:06.130 --> 16:08.098
- HA. YEAH.
SOMETHING.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.757
SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.165
- BEAT YOU WITHIN AN INCH
OF YOUR LIFE

16:11.200 --> 16:13.065
WHEN THIS IS OVER.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.692
[door Opens]
- HOW WAS THE DATE?

16:14.740 --> 16:16.332
- WELL, UH...

16:16.370 --> 16:18.406
JULIET'S GUY TURNED OUT
TO NOT BE A SERIAL KILLER,

16:18.440 --> 16:20.101
SO THAT WAS A BUZZKILL.

16:20.140 --> 16:22.438
BUT I DID GET A LITTLE ACTION
OFF LASSITER,

16:22.480 --> 16:24.072
YOU KNOW, OVER THE CLOTHES.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.509
MIDDLE-SCHOOL STYLE.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.211
- COME SIT.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.569
- GUYS...
[TV playing]

16:28.620 --> 16:30.349
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.508
THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION.
YOU SEE THAT?

16:34.560 --> 16:37.757
I DON'T SEE HOW ALL OF US
LIVING TOGETHER IS GONNA WORK.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.428
YOU'RE DIVORCED.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.428
I'M IN MY 30$.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.791
IT'S WEIRD.

16:42.830 --> 16:47.199
YOU GUYS CAN SEE THAT...
[mood mu5Ic over TV]

16:47.240 --> 16:49.595
IS THAT THE BOY WHO COULD FLY?

16:49.640 --> 16:53.132
[grunts]

16:53.180 --> 16:56.377
NOBODY UNDERSTOOD HIM
BUT MILLY.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.777
AND THEN HE JUST FLEW AWAY...

16:59.810 --> 17:02.119
INTO THE CLOUDS.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.583
YOU KNOW...

17:03.620 --> 17:06.316
SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE THAT LITTLE BOY.

17:06.350 --> 17:07.453
- I DID SOME
OF YOUR LAUNDRY TODAY.

17:07.490 --> 17:08.787
IT'S ON YOUR BED.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.287
- MOM, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.127
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO DO MY LAUNDRY.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.752
- BUT I COULDN'T REMEMBER
IF YOU LIKED YOUR SOCKS FOLDED

17:13.800 --> 17:15.392
OR ROLLED INTO BALLS.
- I LIKE MY SOCKS IN BALLS.

17:15.430 --> 17:18.024
- I DID BALLS.
- WELL, THAT'S FORTUITOUS.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.103
FLY, ERIC...

17:24.140 --> 17:26.301
FLY.

17:26.340 --> 17:31.141
- UH, O'HARA, SPENCER,
THIS IS MR. FIELDING MELLISH.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.341
HE IS A TECHNICAL REP
FROM SOULMATECONNECTION.COM

17:33.380 --> 17:35.439
WHO'S GONNA HELP US TRACK
OUR PROFILES

17:35.480 --> 17:37.789
AND THE CORRESPONDENCE
OF OUR SUSPECTS.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.414
- HI, MR. MELLISH.
I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.781
AND YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE ME,
BUT I'M ALSO HELENE,

17:42.820 --> 17:45.084
THE UNDERCOVER DECOY
WORKING THE CASE.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.188
- I THINK I'M CAUGHT UP.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.754
- SWEET.
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.098
I'LL BE PLAYING MYSELF
THE WHOLE TIME.

17:50.130 --> 17:53.133
- UH, NOW THAT LORDAN
IS LESS PROBABLE,

17:53.170 --> 17:55.491
OUR NEXT LIKELY
OF THE SIX ORIGINAL SUSPECT S

17:55.540 --> 17:58.862
GOES ON THE SITE WITH THE NAME
OF "MR. POSSIBILITIES."

17:58.910 --> 18:02.107
CAN YOU PULL HIM UP, PLEASE?

18:02.140 --> 18:05.177
- MR. POSSIBILITIES?
TRY "MR. PERFECT."

18:05.210 --> 18:06.768
- WOW, HE LOOKS
LIKE A MALE MODEL.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.243
- I WAS A HAND MODEL.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.817
YOU WANT TO BUY THIS PEN? NO?

18:10.850 --> 18:12.886
NOW YOU DO.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.354
- OH, HE'S ALSO AN ART DEALER,
A SKI INSTRUCTOR,

18:15.390 --> 18:18.120
AND HE RUNS HIS OWN
NON-PROFIT CHILDREN'S CHARITY.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.889
- AND, UM, THIS GUY'S SINGLE?

18:19.930 --> 18:24.594
WOW, I REALLY MISSED OUT
ON THIS ONLINE THING.

18:24.630 --> 18:28.361
AND I AM GONNA LET YOU GET BACK
TO WORK.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.335
_ OKAY...
[tltters] THANK YOU.

18:31.370 --> 18:34.737
- SO YOU WROTE
TO THIS GUY FOUR TIMES

18:34.780 --> 18:37.305
UNDER YOUR COVER PROFILE.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.772
- YES, AND I CANNOT GET
A DATE WITH HIM!

18:38.810 --> 18:41.176
- EASY THERE,
"DEBBIE DOES SANTA BARBARA."

18:41.220 --> 18:42.869
- LISTEN, IF YOU ASK ME,

18:42.920 --> 18:44.410
I THINK YOUR PROFILE
NEEDS SOME SPRUCING UP.

18:44.450 --> 18:47.783
- SPRUCING UP?
- WELL, YEAH.

18:47.820 --> 18:50.380
YOU SEEM SORT OF
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.182
I MEAN, WHO LISTS
THE MENTALIST

18:52.230 --> 18:53.925
AS ONE
OF THEIR FAVORITE TV SHOWS?

18:53.960 --> 18:55.222
YOU NEED TO GET MORE SPICY.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.693
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

18:56.730 --> 18:58.163
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE FUN
OF THE MENTALIST?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.758
- I-I DON'T REALLY--
- I'M SERIOUS.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.791
WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY
TAKE A SHOT AT THAT SHOW?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.865
- I-I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN IT.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.868
- OKAY.
- I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

19:06.910 --> 19:09.276
YOU HAVE
TO TAILOR-MAKE YOUR PROFILE

19:09.310 --> 19:10.868
TO ATTRACT
THIS MR. POSSIBILITIES.

19:10.910 --> 19:13.242
- WHAT WILL IT TAKE?

19:13.280 --> 19:15.646
- I THINK WE'RE LOOKING
AT A COMPLETE OVERHAUL HERE.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.409
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO ATTRACT

19:17.450 --> 19:21.614
A 30-SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD GUY
WHO LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.878
- THAT IS SO TRUE.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.727
- PATH ETIC.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.227
- WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

19:27.260 --> 19:28.955
I'VE EVER BEEN FINGERPRINTED
ON A DATE.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.491
- MA'AM, JUST KEEP COOPERATING.

19:31.530 --> 19:34.499
OR I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU BACK
INTO THE INTERROGATION ROOM.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.737
- GUS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A DATE.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.273
- HOW CAN THIS POSSIBLY
STILL BE GOING ON?

19:40.310 --> 19:41.971
- HE'S BOOKING ME.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.478
- SOME OF US ARE IN THERE
DOING REAL DETECTIVE WORK--

19:44.510 --> 19:45.909
THERE, IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM--

19:45.950 --> 19:49.977
WHILE YOU TWO ARE ACTING
LIKE CHILDREN, OUT HERE.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.908
WHAT?

19:51.950 --> 19:53.417
THIS IS MY LUNCH.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.257
WHICH WAS PACKED FOR ME
BY MY MOTHER.

19:55.290 --> 19:57.258
[bag rustles]
IT IS CLEARLY LABELED "GOOSE,"

19:57.290 --> 19:59.952
AND NOW IT CANNOT BE STOLEN,
WHICH HAPPENS.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.426
EVEN HERE AT A POLICE STATION.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.460
- [sighs]
HI, SHAWN.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.762
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.802
- UH...YOU...

20:10.840 --> 20:12.569
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE LATE

20:12.610 --> 20:14.475
FOR A WHITESNAKE VIDEO SHOOT.

20:14.510 --> 20:15.932
- SHAWN, RELAX.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.800
I DON'T ACTUALLY WANT
TO DATE ANY OF THESE GUYS.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.841
I'M TRYING TO SOLVE A MURDER.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.313
- HELENE?

20:21.350 --> 20:22.817
- LORDAN.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.647
- COME ON.
THIS GUY?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.750
HE'S A LAME-CHOP SLATHERED
IN FAIL SAUCE.

20:27.790 --> 20:28.950
- HEY, DID YOU GET THE FLOWERS
I SENT?

20:28.990 --> 20:31.652
- YES, YES, UM, I DID.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.397
THEY WERE GORGEOUS.
THANK YOU.

20:34.430 --> 20:35.795
- THIS GUY HAS BEEN ELIMINATED
AS A SUSPECT.

20:35.830 --> 20:36.956
THEREFORE, THERE IS NO NEED
FOR FLIRTATION.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.888
- ELIMINATED?

20:38.930 --> 20:40.761
SHAWN, JUST BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T KILL ME AT THE TIME

20:40.800 --> 20:42.290
DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T WANT TO.
- YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.807
WE DO THIS TOGETHER.
I'M YOUR WINGMAN.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.331
- SHAWN, I DON'T NEED A WINGMAN.
LAY BACK.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.474
- WHO'S THIS?
- A FRIEND.

20:48.510 --> 20:49.807
- FRIEND, REALLY.
THAT'S ME.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.943
[stutters]
I'M AT FRIEND STATUS?

20:50.980 --> 20:52.743
- YES, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU BE,
SHAWN?

20:52.780 --> 20:54.975
- WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT
A SUIT FOR A SCHOOL PICTURE?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.817
- [chuckles]
NO.

20:56.850 --> 21:00.513
EVERY TIME I CLOSE A BIG DEAL,
I BUY MYSELF A SUIT.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.959
I'M IN THE COMMERCIAL
REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.

21:01.990 --> 21:04.857
I BUILD SKYSCRAPERS.
WHAT BUSINESS ARE YOU IN?

21:04.890 --> 21:06.983
- I'M A PSYCHIC, JACK.
AND I BUILD...

21:07.030 --> 21:08.850
SWEDISH FURNITURE.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.822
- AND HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.338
- THEY'RE OLD AND FRAIL,
AND I HAVE TO CARE FOR THEM.

21:13.370 --> 21:14.530
AND ONE OF THEM
HAS A COLOSTOMY BAG.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.037
- OH.

21:16.070 --> 21:17.731
- HEY, GOOSE!
COME TRY THESE ON.

21:17.770 --> 21:20.830
I WANT TO SEE HOW THEY FIT
IN YOUR SEAT.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.906
- LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE RIDE OVER HERE

21:23.950 --> 21:26.009
BUT I AM IN THE MIDDLE
[softly] OF AN INVESTIGATION.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.642
- WELL, AT LEAST HOLD THIS UP
TO YOUR SHOULDERS

21:27.680 --> 21:29.375
SO I CAN SEE
ABOUT THE SLEEVE LENGTH.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.512
- MOM, DO YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID?

21:30.550 --> 21:32.415
I'M INVESTIGATING A MUR--

21:32.450 --> 21:34.315
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
THAT IS NICE.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.850
- DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT AGAIN
SOMETIME?

21:35.890 --> 21:38.529
- NO. UM...

21:38.560 --> 21:40.994
LOOK, LORDAN, YOU ARE...

21:41.030 --> 21:42.588
WONDERFUL.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.928
BUT I'M NOT YOUR GIRL.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.064
THAT'S ACTUALLY MY EX, AND...

21:48.100 --> 21:49.590
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.904
- REALLY?
THAT GUY?

21:51.940 --> 21:53.908
- THAT'S HIS MOM.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.534
- HE'S A LUCKY GUY.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.740
GOOD LUCK, HELENE.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.544
- THANK YOU.

22:00.580 --> 22:04.846
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A REALLY HANDSOME BABY-DADDY.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.585
YEAH.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.850
SO BYE,
[giggles] YOU KNOW...

22:08.890 --> 22:12.883
WHOA, YEP, THAT'S THERE.
FOR NOW.

22:12.930 --> 22:15.455
- SEE YOU.
- WHAT THE HELL IS ALL OF THAT?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.968
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS DUDE.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.867
THIS IS ABOUT YOU COMPETING
WITH THOSE GIRLS

22:20.900 --> 22:22.868
THAT MR. POSSIBILITIES
DID GO OUT WITH.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.106
- WHAT IS IT?

22:24.140 --> 22:26.461
AM I NOT AS ATTRACTIVE?

22:26.510 --> 22:27.909
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
- I DON'T KNOW, JULES.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.430
THOSE GIRLS ARE DEAD.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.472
YOU ARE COMPETING WITH GIRLS
WHO WERE MURDERED.

22:32.510 --> 22:35.911
- SO THAT'S IT.
SO I'M--I'M NOT AS ATTRACTIVE.

22:35.950 --> 22:38.510
WOW, IT KIND OF
MAKES ME HATE THOSE GIRLS.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.916
- THE DEAD GIRLS.
THE MURDERED GIRLS.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.655
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE

22:42.690 --> 22:44.487
AND DISRESPECTFUL
THAT I SAID THAT.

22:44.530 --> 22:48.557
- ACTUALLY, IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU JUST SAID THAT.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.953
HANG WITH ME, MELLISH.
I KNOW YOU CAN.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.661
WE HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATING
THIS WHOLE TIME

22:51.700 --> 22:53.793
ON THE MEN
THESE WOMEN ARE DATING.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.660
BUT WHAT IF, WHAT IF...

22:55.700 --> 22:57.406
IT'S ONE OF THE OTHER WOMEN.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.509
ONE WHO'S JEALOUS.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.007
- WOMEN.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.907
WHEN THEY SMELL YOUR PHEROMONES,
THEIR CLAWS COME OUT.

23:02.940 --> 23:03.941
SEEN IT FIRSTHAND.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.641
- I BET YOU HAVE.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.716
YOU STRIKE ME
AS A REAL SWORDSMAN.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.411
- WELL, I WAS A FENCER
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

23:09.450 --> 23:10.815
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

23:10.850 --> 23:12.408
BUT, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT IF ONE OF THESE WOMEN

23:12.450 --> 23:14.418
IS LITERALLY KILLING OFF
HER COMPETITION?

23:14.460 --> 23:16.587
- I'M DOING A SEARCH RIGHT NOW

23:16.620 --> 23:18.850
OF ALL CORRESPONDENCES
WITH "MR. POSSIBILITIES."

23:18.890 --> 23:21.450
THERE WERE SEVERAL WOMEN
WHO WROTE TO HIM

23:21.500 --> 23:24.162
BUT ONE WOMAN WROTE
TO HIM MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE TIMES

23:24.200 --> 23:25.792
WITH NO RESPONSE.

23:25.830 --> 23:26.967
HA. WOW.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.037
TO GET THIS GUY.
- [chortles]

23:30.070 --> 23:31.799
- KIND OF CREEPY.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.728
EVEN FOR CREEPY
ONLINE-DATING PEOPLE.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.499
- BINGO.
WHO IS SHE?

23:36.540 --> 23:40.169
[tense music]

23:40.210 --> 23:42.075
- UH-OH.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.812
- SEE, IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE FOLLOW-THROUGH.

23:46.850 --> 23:47.987
- YOU'VE DONE THIS MOVE BEFORE?

23:48.020 --> 23:50.011
- FIRST TIME, ACTUALLY.
IS IT WORKING?

23:50.060 --> 23:51.721
- WELL, LET'S SEE
IF I MAKE THIS SHOT.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.455
- HMM.
- FORE!

23:53.500 --> 23:55.889
- OH!
- HA!

23:55.930 --> 23:57.659
SORRY ABOUT THAT!

23:57.700 --> 23:59.918
THE MOUTH
ON THAT EVIL CLOWN HEAD

23:59.970 --> 24:02.188
IS SO MUCH WIDER THAN I THOUGHT.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.764
- SHAWN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.232
- DON'T WORRY, GUS.
I COME IN PEACE.

24:05.270 --> 24:08.068
I'M HERE TO APOLOGIZE--
NOT TO YOU, BUT TO RACHEL.

24:08.110 --> 24:10.670
CLEARLY, YOU AND I GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.769
OR WHATEVER YOU GUYS CALL IT
"ACROSS THE POND."

24:12.810 --> 24:14.516
- WE CALL IT A FOOT.

24:14.550 --> 24:16.017
- WELL, IT WAS MY FAULT,
AND I'D LIKE TO START OVER.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.779
- WELL, THAT'S BIG OF YOU.
ME TOO.

24:17.820 --> 24:18.844
- RACHEL, YOU SEEM
LIKE A VERY SWEET GIRL

24:18.890 --> 24:20.755
WITH A LOT OF LOVE TO GIVE.

24:20.790 --> 24:21.882
- THANK YOU, SHAWN.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.558
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU
TO SAY.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.023
- UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU ARE ALSO A SERIAL KILLER.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.925
THAT'S RIGHT, GUS.
A KILLER OF WOMEN--

24:26.960 --> 24:28.621
AT LEAST TWO--
WITH BLONDE HAIR.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.093
- NO, NO, NO.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.927
YOU WILL NOT DO THIS AGAIN,
SHAWN.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.221
YOU WILL NOT TAKE THIS
BEAUTIFUL, BUDDING RELATIONSHIP

24:33.270 --> 24:35.033
AND DESTROY IT
BY ACCUSING THE GIRL OF MURDER.

24:35.070 --> 24:36.867
NOT AGAIN.
NOT THIS TIME.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.800
- THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE?
- ONCE OR TWICE, YES.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.000
- LOOK, GUS, I DIDN'T PICK HER.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.928
I CAN'T HELP IT
IF SHE LIKES TO KILL.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.208
- SHAWN, WHILE YOU'RE ACCUSING
MY GIRLFRIEND OF MURDER,

24:43.240 --> 24:44.707
THERE'S A REAL SERIAL KILLER
OUT THERE,

24:44.750 --> 24:46.206
MAYBE GETTING READY
TO KILL AGAIN.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.774
- WAIT, DID YOU JUST CALL ME
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.584
- I'M SORRY.
- NO, DON'T BE.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.919
- YOU WANTED A DATE
WITH MR. POSSIBILITIES.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.086
REMEMBER HIM?
YOU SHOULD.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.212
YOU WROTE
TO HIM OVER EIGHT TIMES

24:56.260 --> 24:57.784
IN A PERIOD OF THREE WEEKS.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.253
EACH TIME HE REJECTED YOU,
YOU GOT JEALOUS,

25:00.290 --> 25:02.019
AND YOU WENT AFTER
THOSE TWO WOMEN,

25:02.060 --> 25:03.891
WHO WERE ABLE TO CAPTURE
HIS ATTENTION, FOR REVENGE.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.989
BECAUSE IF YOU COULDN'T
HAVE HIM, NO ONE COULD.

25:06.030 --> 25:07.167
AM I RIGHT?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.269
- WAIT, YOU WROTE
TO SOME WHITE DUDE,

25:08.300 --> 25:09.892
LIKE, EIGHT TIMES?

25:09.940 --> 25:11.703
- YOU'RE A PSYCHIC
AND YOU MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS?

25:11.740 --> 25:13.002
- IT'S VERY SIMPLE, RACHEL.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.701
JUST PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU HAVE AN ALIBI

25:14.740 --> 25:16.002
FOR THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST
MURDER--APRIL 11TH, AT 9:00 PM.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.871
AND Y STAY OUT OF IT.

25:17.910 --> 25:20.549
DO NOT BE THE TOM SELLECK
TO HER PAULINA PORIZKOVA.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.810
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- FROM HER ALIBI, 1989.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.943
ROTTEN TOMATOMETER--15%.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.844
- AUDIENCE METER--38%.

25:26.890 --> 25:27.879
- IF ANYTHING,
GUS WOULD BE MY JAMES FARENTINO.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.751
- WHO'S THAT?

25:29.790 --> 25:30.882
SOME OTHER WHITE DUDE
YOU TRIED TO GET A DATE WITH?

25:30.930 --> 25:33.125
- THIS IS ME RECEIVING AN AWARD

25:33.160 --> 25:35.697
FOR A SCHOOL NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM
I INITIATED.

25:35.730 --> 25:38.267
LOOK AT THE TIME STAMP.
- 7:30 P.M.? SO WHAT?

25:38.300 --> 25:41.064
WE'RE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU GAVE
A SPEECH ABOUT NUTRITION

25:41.100 --> 25:43.034
THAT LASTED AN HOUR AND A HALF?

25:43.070 --> 25:44.628
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE
YOU WANTED IN THIS CITY

25:44.670 --> 25:46.262
IN 20 MINUTES.
- I WASN'T IN SANTA BARBARA.

25:46.310 --> 25:48.005
I WAS IN NEW YORK.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.076
THIS IS ME IN FRONT
OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.078
- OKAY, LOOK,
OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA HAVE

25:52.110 --> 25:55.341
TO VERIFY ALL THIS INFORMATION
DOWN AT THE STATION.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.689
BUT, FOR NOW, IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT YOU'RE OKAY TO...

25:57.720 --> 25:58.812
KEEP PUTTING.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.784
JUST DON'T TRY TO SKIP TOWN.

26:00.820 --> 26:01.980
- YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.954
- WELL, I AM.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.855
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,
I'M JUST GONNA--

26:05.890 --> 26:09.257
JUST GONNA PLAY THROUGH.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.690
HEY, JULES.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.764
HEY, I JUST ACCUSED
GUS' GIRLFRIEND

26:16.800 --> 26:18.062
OF BEING A SERIAL KILLER,

26:18.110 --> 26:20.135
AND NOW I'M PLAYING MINI GOLF
BY MYSELF.

26:20.170 --> 26:22.934
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE
I MAY BE GOING DOWN A BAD PATH.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.868
SO LET'S MAKE THIS A DATE NIGHT,
SHALL WE?

26:24.910 --> 26:26.241
- OOH, SHAWN, I CAN'T.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.373
BECAUSE I GOT A DATE
WITH * MR. PERFECT!

26:28.420 --> 26:30.172
YES, I GUESS
THE NEW PROFILE WORKED.

26:30.220 --> 26:32.381
- YOU SOUND GENUINELY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.854
-IAM!

26:34.890 --> 26:36.084
AS A DETECTIVE.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.385
FOR THE BREAK, SHAWN.

26:39.430 --> 26:42.092
BUT, UH, LOOK,
I REALLY NEED YOU IN MY EAR

26:42.130 --> 26:45.258
FOR SURVEILLANCE.
I CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

26:45.300 --> 26:48.633
SHAWN, I NEED YOU TO FIND A WAY
TO BE OKAY WITH THIS.

26:48.670 --> 26:50.035
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?

26:50.070 --> 26:51.662
MY GIRLFRIEND
HAS A NEW BOYFRIEND,

26:51.710 --> 26:53.029
MY BEST FRIEND HAS A GIRLFRIEND,

26:53.070 --> 26:54.970
MY MOM BOUGHT ME SHORTS.

26:55.010 --> 26:57.001
LOOK, I JUST--I NEED SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO HERE.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.407
- SHAWN, I WOULD,
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY,

27:00.450 --> 27:01.849
BUT WE ARE JUST SO BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.747
YEAH, CAN YOU GO BACK?
- OKAY.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.041
MA! DAD!

27:06.090 --> 27:09.150
THINK I COULD USE A QUICK CHAT.

27:09.190 --> 27:12.227
MOM.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.228
LOOK, DAD--

27:14.260 --> 27:17.093
- OH!
- OH!

27:19.730 --> 27:22.961
- [slo-mo]
NO!

27:24.210 --> 27:27.168
- [slo-mo]
GOOSE!

27:27.210 --> 27:28.700
- [screams]

27:28.740 --> 27:31.300
FLY, ERIC.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.045
FLY HIGH.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.378
HIGH INTO THE CLOUDS.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.978
- I WANT YOU TO FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.284
THERE ARE NO SILLY,
STUPID QUESTIONS.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.459
- PLEASE, STOP MAKING SOUNDS
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

27:41.490 --> 27:43.822
- IT ALL HAPPENED
VERY ORGANICALLY.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.157
I'M STILL TRYING
TO PROCESS IT MYSELF.

27:45.190 --> 27:48.956
I THINK MAYBE IT GREW OUT
OF OUR HISTORY OR...

27:49.000 --> 27:52.299
MAYBE MY NEW OUTLOOK ON LIFE,
POST BEING SHOT.

27:52.330 --> 27:55.060
PLUS...

27:55.100 --> 27:59.002
YOUR MOTHER
IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.234
AND I'M A MAN.

28:00.270 --> 28:03.205
WITH NEEDS.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.846
- [grunts]
DAD?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.177
- YEAH.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.017
- WHEN I WAS A KID...

28:10.050 --> 28:12.018
- THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.
KEEP GOING.

28:12.050 --> 28:13.312
- I HAD A RECURRING NIGHTMARE

28:13.350 --> 28:17.980
THAT ALIENS CAME DOWN
AND ABDUCTED ME.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.124
AND THEY DID EXPERIMENTS
ON MY BRAIN.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.867
WHERE ARE THOSE ALIENS NOW?

28:23.900 --> 28:26.994
- SHAWN, LOOK.
- PLEASE, TAKE ME AWAY.

28:27.030 --> 28:29.032
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ALIENS,

28:29.070 --> 28:33.769
BUT I DO KNOW THAT LOVEMAKING
CAN BE A VERY BEAUTIFUL THING

28:33.810 --> 28:37.075
IF IT'S A PRODUCT
OF A LOVING RELATIONSHIP.

28:37.110 --> 28:39.977
- HOLY CRAP.

28:40.010 --> 28:43.218
DAD, LOOK AT THIS GUY.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.081
- WHOA, WHOA, SHAWN.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.008
I DON'T THINK I'M READY
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

28:47.050 --> 28:49.416
- NO, NO, DAD, LOOK.
IT'S THE SAME GUY.

28:49.460 --> 28:52.486
THIS IS THE SAME MAN.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.397
[computer keys clicking]

28:55.430 --> 28:56.988
THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN
STRAIGHT FROM THE CATALOG

28:57.030 --> 28:58.964
AND THEN PHOTOSHOPPED
WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.763
LIKE THIS ONE,
WITH HIM IN THE SKI GEAR.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.131
LOOK, IT'S SHOT IN A STUDIO,
RIGHT?

29:02.170 --> 29:03.899
NOW LOOK AT THIS.

29:03.940 --> 29:06.067
ON THE PROFILE,
HE'S IN FRONT OF A SKI LII-T,

29:06.110 --> 29:07.771
LIKE HE'S ACTUALLY SKIING.

29:07.810 --> 29:10.278
- SHAWN, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN OBSESSED WITH THIS MAN?

29:10.310 --> 29:12.073
- DAD, I GOT TO GO.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.475
THIS TALK OF OURS
WILL HAVE TO WAIT

29:13.510 --> 29:15.011
UNTIL WELL Al-TER WE'RE DEAD.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.779
AND EVEN THEN,
THE DEAD VERSION OF ME

29:16.820 --> 29:18.242
IS NOT GONNA HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR THE DEAD VERSION OF YOU.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.917
'CAUSE IT WASN'T ORGANIC.

29:19.950 --> 29:22.987
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT LOVEMAKING.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.783
THANKS FOR JOINING THE CASE,
BUDDY.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.149
- NOT A PROBLEM.

29:26.190 --> 29:27.953
- AND I'M SORRY
I ACCUSED YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND

29:28.000 --> 29:29.319
OF TRYING TO PULL
A BRIDE OF CHUCKY THING.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.169
- IT'S COOL.
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

29:31.200 --> 29:33.794
TO BE LONELY AND SINGLE.
- WELL, I'M NOT SINGLE, GUS.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.932
AND THAT WAS YOU,
AS OF YESTERDAY.

29:34.970 --> 29:36.494
- OH, SHAWN,

29:36.540 --> 29:38.064
YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BE IN A HEALTHY HEAD SPACE.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.532
- I'M SORRY.

29:39.570 --> 29:40.969
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
I WALKED IN

29:41.010 --> 29:43.103
ON MY DIVORCED PARENTS
HAVING SEX, GUS.

29:43.140 --> 29:44.471
THEN MY DAD SET ME DOWN

29:44.510 --> 29:46.398
AND TOLD ME THAT MY BODY
WAS A WONDERLAND.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.042
- SHAWN, ARE YOU SURE YOU SAW
WHAT YOU THINK YOU SAW?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.274
- YES, I'M POSITIVE.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.380
1--
[whimpers]

29:52.420 --> 29:54.081
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- WHAT?

29:54.120 --> 29:56.008
- DID YOU EVER WALK IN
ON YOUR PARENTS?

29:56.060 --> 29:57.311
- MY PARENTS NEVER HAD SEX,
SHAWN.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.282
- OF COURSE, THEY DID.
- DIDN'T HAPPEN.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.298
LOOK, YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE
OF GOD'S PERFECT LITTLE MIRACLES

30:01.330 --> 30:02.592
RIGHT NOW.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.120
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, WHAT ABOUT JOY?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.819
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
SHE ISN'T ADOPTED.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.326
- WHERE IS SHE, BY THE WAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:07.370 --> 30:08.997
MAN, WHY ARE WE SITTING IN FRONT
OF SOME DUDE'S HOUSE?

30:09.040 --> 30:10.564
BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST
"SOME DUDE," GUS.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.508
MR. POSSIBILITIES
ISN'T WHO HE SAYS HE IS.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.076
HIS REAL NAME IS KEN DOWLING.

30:16.110 --> 30:18.169
FABRICATED AN ENTIRE PROFILE

30:18.210 --> 30:20.371
TO TRY AND CREATE
THE PERFECT SINGLE MAN

30:20.410 --> 30:21.616
LIVING IN SANTA BARBARA.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.072
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

30:23.120 --> 30:25.987
- BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY MARRIED.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.908
LASSIE CONFIRMED
THAT HE HAS A RECORD.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.019
AND HE IS THE ONLY ONE LEI-T
OF THE ORIGINAL SIX.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.254
- MM-MM.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.326
I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON RACHEL.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.920
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT HAVING HER
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.396
- REALLY? JUST THINK BACK
TO YESTERDAY AT ABOUT 6:00 PM.

30:39.430 --> 30:41.239
COME ON.

30:41.270 --> 30:43.488
WE HAVE A MARRIAGE TO DESTROY.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.167
- MY HUSBAND
IS HAVING AN AFFAIR?

30:45.210 --> 30:46.507
- IF ONLY IT WERE THAT SIMPLE,
MIRANDA.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.428
- I'M JUST COMING DOWN FOR--

30:48.480 --> 30:50.869
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

30:50.910 --> 30:52.172
- SHAWN SPENCER--
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.417
THIS IS MY PARTNER
AND IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

30:54.450 --> 30:55.872
WE ARE BOTH NOT MARRIED.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.410
ALTHOUGH HE HAS
A NEW GIRLFRIEND,

30:57.450 --> 30:59.179
AND MY GIRLFRIEND'S CURRENTLY
SEEING OTHER PEOPLE,

30:59.220 --> 31:01.518
BUT STRICTLY FOR PROFESSIONAL
REASONS--SHE'S A PRO.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.118
- YOU HAVE A PROFILE
ON A DATING WEBSITE?

31:03.160 --> 31:04.923
- GO AHEAD, KEN.
TELL HER.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.020
YOU USED ONLINE DATING
TO RELIVE YOUR SINGLE DAYS.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.290
TELL HER HOW YOU CREATED
THIS MR. POSSIBILITIES PROFILE

31:10.330 --> 31:11.627
AND STARTED LIVING
A DOUBLE LIFE.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.467
- KEN?

31:13.500 --> 31:15.195
- ONLY THING YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON
WERE THOSE TWO POOR BLONDE GIRLS

31:15.240 --> 31:17.299
FIGURING YOU OUT AND THREATENING
TO EXPOSE YOU TO YOUR WIFE.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.137
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GUS?

31:19.170 --> 31:20.899
- I'M REALLY HEARING MOST
OF THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.578
- YOU HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO GET RID OF 'EM

31:22.610 --> 31:25.977
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
CCCCHHHH!

31:26.010 --> 31:31.016
' [gasping]

31:31.050 --> 31:33.644
- [slo-mo]
GOOSE!

31:33.690 --> 31:36.318
- WHO IS GOOSE?
- I DON'T KNOW!

31:36.360 --> 31:40.387
I MEAN, I WOULD NEVER
USE THOSE PICTURES TO GET DATES.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.250
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US?

31:42.300 --> 31:43.653
- YES, KEN.
HOW COULD YOU?

31:43.700 --> 31:45.998
LOOK AT THAT PUG'S FACE.
LOOK AT IT!

31:46.030 --> 31:48.032
SHAME ON YOU,
SHAME ON YOU.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.038
I CAN SENSE IT--
YOUR INFIDELITY,

31:50.070 --> 31:52.334
YOUR EXTRACU RRICU LAR ACTIVITIES,

31:52.370 --> 31:55.009
POSSIBLY. . .OFFICE-RELATED.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.076
I'M NOT SURE.
- KEN?

31:57.110 --> 32:00.045
- I WENT OUT WITH MY SECRETARY
FOR LUNCH ONCE. ONCE.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.945
- DID YOU ORDER DESSERT?
- DID YOU ORDER DESSERT?

32:01.980 --> 32:03.208
- YEAH, MAYBE,
I DON'T KNOW!

32:03.250 --> 32:05.241
WHAT--WHAT DOES THIS MATTER?

32:05.290 --> 32:07.110
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA DO, KEN.

32:07.150 --> 32:09.618
I'M GONNA CALL A CAR
TO COME HERE AND ARREST YOU.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.150
MCNAB! HEY!

32:11.190 --> 32:12.953
I NEED ONE PADDY WAGON,
ONE PATTY MELT,

32:12.990 --> 32:16.426
SOME YELLOW CRIME-SCENE TAPE,
AND, UH, TWO CINNAMON ROLLS

32:16.460 --> 32:18.496
DELIVERED
TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS--

32:18.530 --> 32:20.327
JULES.
- SO THIS THING IS OFF?

32:20.370 --> 32:22.565
- I GOT GOOD NEWS
AND I GOT BETTER NEWS.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.500
GOOD NEWS IS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO ON A DATE

32:24.540 --> 32:25.962
WITH MR. PERFECT...
[glass shatters]

32:26.010 --> 32:27.568
BECAUSE MR. PERFECT
IS MARRIED.

32:27.610 --> 32:29.305
- MARRIED?

32:29.340 --> 32:31.069
- DON'T SOUND SO DISAPPOINTED.
THAT WAS THE GOOD NEWS.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.077
- I'M SORRY, O'HARA.

32:32.110 --> 32:33.748
- WHY IS EVERYBODY SO SORRY?

32:33.780 --> 32:36.146
LOOK, I BUSTED THIS GUY
BY FIGURING OUT

32:36.180 --> 32:39.308
THAT HE MURDERED THOSE WOMEN
WHEN THEY DISCOVERED HIS SCAM.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.215
- DID HE LOOK AS GOOD
AS HIS PICTURES?

32:41.260 --> 32:44.252
- HONEY, PLEASE!

32:44.290 --> 32:45.757
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

32:45.790 --> 32:48.122
HELLO?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.650
- IT'S A TOUGH BREAK, O'HARA,
BUT TELL YOU WHAT.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.292
I'LL GO SNATCH THIS GUY UP
AND BOOK HIM.

32:51.330 --> 32:53.423
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME,
WATCH A COUPLE EPISODES

32:53.470 --> 32:55.597
OF SEX AND THE CITY
AND SHAKE THIS WHOLE THING OFF.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.132
- UH, WHAT IS SHE SHAKING OFF
EXACTLY?

32:59.170 --> 33:02.401
HELLO?

33:02.440 --> 33:05.477
[ringtone chimes]

33:05.510 --> 33:07.375
HELLO, MY DEAR.

33:07.410 --> 33:08.741
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

33:08.780 --> 33:10.316
IS IF YOU GO HOME TONIGHT,

33:10.350 --> 33:12.284
CHANGE INTO YOUR HELENE OUTFIT,

33:12.320 --> 33:14.652
DO A LITTLE DANCE
TO POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME.

33:14.690 --> 33:16.317
- IT ISN'T JULES,
BUT I'D BE WILLING

33:16.360 --> 33:17.759
TO WEAR
WHAT I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW

33:17.790 --> 33:19.121
AND DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT.
- MELLISH?

33:19.160 --> 33:21.048
- I KNOW YOU TOLD ME TO CALL YOU

33:21.100 --> 33:23.227
IF THERE WAS ANY ACTIVITY
ON MR. PERFECT '5 ACCOUNT.

33:23.260 --> 33:24.761
- WELL, THAT IS
NO LONGER NECESSARY,

33:24.800 --> 33:28.031
BECAUSE MR. POSSIBILITIES,
AKA MR. PERFECT,

33:28.070 --> 33:30.732
HAS BEEN ARRESTED.
HE'S DONE.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.499
- WELL, THEN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU EXPLAIN THIS.

33:32.540 --> 33:35.031
MR. POSSIBILITIES
JUST SENT AN EMAIL,

33:35.080 --> 33:36.479
TEN MINUTES AGO.

33:36.510 --> 33:38.649
- WELL,
UNLESS HE USED HIS TEETH

33:38.680 --> 33:42.343
OR HIT THE LITTLE KEYS
WITH HIS NOSE WHILE HANDCUFFED,

33:42.380 --> 33:44.189
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

33:44.220 --> 33:47.781
- UNLESS THE GUY YOU HAVE IN
CUFFS IS NOT MR. POSSIBILITIES.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.483
- HMM.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.458
- MIKE?

34:05.510 --> 34:07.307
- HELLO, HELENE.

34:10.580 --> 34:12.741
- YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE ME HERE, HELENE?

34:12.780 --> 34:14.816
WERE YOU WAITING ON A DATE
OR SOMETHING?

34:14.850 --> 34:17.341
- NO, UH,
TO BE HONEST

34:17.380 --> 34:19.848
I SORT OF GAVE UP
ON THAT WHOLE DATING THING.

34:19.890 --> 34:21.778
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH DRAMA.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.515
- YEAH, ME TOO, ME TOO.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.824
UH, SO YOU'RE NOT
HERE EXPECTING

34:25.860 --> 34:27.748
TO SEE A MR. POSSIBILITIES?

34:27.790 --> 34:29.326
- WHO? NO.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.828
NO, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.634
- HELENE.

34:34.670 --> 34:37.798
[laughs]

34:37.840 --> 34:39.569
[clicks tongue]
- WHAT?

34:39.610 --> 34:40.759
WHO IS HE?

34:40.810 --> 34:42.835
- WELL, HE'S NOBODY.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.802
YEAH, HE DOESN'T EXIST.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.772
I'M SORRY, DID YOU THINK--

34:46.810 --> 34:49.870
YEAH, THE REALLY BAD NEWS,
FOR YOU,

34:49.920 --> 34:53.412
IS THAT I CREATED HIM.

34:53.450 --> 34:56.578
TO PROVE A POINT.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.550
- LASSIE, WE GOT TO GO!
JULES IS IN TROUBLE!

35:00.590 --> 35:01.852
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.289
- I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY.
GUS, COME ON!

35:04.330 --> 35:07.322
- SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT?

35:07.370 --> 35:09.463
LET'S GO LOOK AT SOME DUCKS.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.469
COME ON,
NICE AND EASY.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.569
NICE AND EASY.

35:14.610 --> 35:15.907
IT'LL BE JUST LIKE A DATE.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.874
- TO PROVE A POINT TO WHO?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.241
- OH, TO ALL YOU WOMEN.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.919
BECAUSE YOU LIE.
WATCH YOUR STEP.

35:21.950 --> 35:23.770
YEAH, YOU SAY YOU WANT
THE NICE GUY.

35:23.820 --> 35:27.586
YOU SAY YOU WANT THE GOOD GUY,
BUT THEN...HA HA HA!

35:27.620 --> 35:29.156
YOU'RE ALL SO SHALLOW.

35:29.190 --> 35:31.750
AND I JUST PROVED IT.

35:31.790 --> 35:34.623
[sighs]
I HATE THIS.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.924
THIS IS JUST--

35:36.960 --> 35:39.895
THIS IS JUST A TERRIBLE,
HORRIBLE THING

35:39.930 --> 35:42.262
YOU'RE MAKING ME DO, HELENE.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.768
- MIKE, NO ONE
IS MAKING YOU DO ANYTH--

35:44.810 --> 35:45.765
- YES, YOU ARE!

35:45.810 --> 35:48.836
[siren wails]

35:53.810 --> 35:55.949
- MIKE.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.948
JULIET'S DATE
FROM THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

35:57.980 --> 36:01.780
- OH, YEAH, I DATED BOTH
OF THOSE GIRLS THAT WERE KILLED.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.310
YEAH, THEY REJECTED ME.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.180
THEY GAVE EXCUSES
WHY THEY WEREN'T READY

36:05.230 --> 36:06.629
FOR A RELATIONSHIP,

36:06.660 --> 36:08.298
AND THEN THEY TURNED AROUND

36:08.330 --> 36:10.924
AND THEY WERE TOTALLY
INTERESTED IN MY, UH,

36:10.960 --> 36:13.622
[laughs] FICTITIOUS ALTER EGO
MR. POSSIBILITIES,

36:13.670 --> 36:16.889
BECAUSE HE'S GOOD-LOOKING,
AND HE SEEMS FLAWLESS.

36:16.940 --> 36:21.229
YOU SEE, WOMEN...DON'T WANT
WHAT THEY SAY THEY WANT.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.407
AND YOU'RE THE SAME.
[gun cocks]

36:23.440 --> 36:25.271
[tires screech]

36:26.710 --> 36:27.870
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS WAS THE MEETING SPOT.

36:27.910 --> 36:30.413
- CAN'T BE FAR OFF.
LET'S SPLIT UP!

36:30.450 --> 36:31.519
REMEMBER OUR DATE
AT THE RESTAURANT?

36:31.550 --> 36:33.313
REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME?

36:33.350 --> 36:34.851
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD ME
THAT THINGS WERE--WHAT WAS IT?

36:34.890 --> 36:36.209
WHAT WAS IT, HELENE?
THEY WERE TOO COMPLICATED?

36:36.260 --> 36:38.683
THEY WERE TOO COMPLICATED
FOR YOU?

36:38.730 --> 36:40.857
AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND

36:40.890 --> 36:42.653
AND YOU WRITE
TO MR. POSSIBILITY,

36:42.700 --> 36:46.261
AND YOU PRACTICALLY BEG--BEG--
TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.798
I ALMOST GAVE YOU A PASS,
BUT THEN YOU KEPT WRITING.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.637
YOU WERE RELENTLESS.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.537
YOU JUST HAD TO GO OUT WITH HIM!
DIDN'T YOU?

36:56.580 --> 36:58.377
- NO, I DIDN'T--
- DON'T TURN AROUND!

36:58.410 --> 36:59.672
- [grunts]

37:05.650 --> 37:08.414
BUT I'M NOT LIKE
THOSE OTHER GIRLS.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.552
I DID LIKE YOU.

37:09.590 --> 37:12.024
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

37:12.060 --> 37:13.880
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
THAT YOU WERE INTO ME.

37:13.930 --> 37:17.252
I MEAN, YOU ACT UALLY--
YOU MADE ME A LITTLE NERVOUS,

37:17.300 --> 37:20.599
BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T THINK
THAT SOMEONE LIKE YOU

37:20.630 --> 37:22.962
WOULD TAKE SOMEONE LIKE ME
SERIOUSLY.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.706
IT'S TRUE.

37:24.740 --> 37:29.530
I JUST WONDERED,
THE WHOLE TIME,

37:29.580 --> 37:33.402
WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE
WITHOUT THOSE GLASSES.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.947
MAY I?

37:45.360 --> 37:46.759
SEE?

37:46.790 --> 37:49.452
THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.728
WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES,

37:50.760 --> 37:55.038
I SEE HOW DEEPLY
YOU FEEL THINGS,

37:55.070 --> 37:57.891
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAD TO DO

37:57.940 --> 37:59.703
WHAT YOU DID
TO THOSE GIRLS.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.937
- YOU DO?
- AND NOW...

38:02.980 --> 38:06.541
IT CAN JUST BE YOU...AND ME.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.389
- GAH! AHH!

38:12.420 --> 38:13.785
[grunting]

38:13.820 --> 38:16.812
- JULES, I'M COMING!

38:18.930 --> 38:21.490
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS!
GET A ROOM.

38:21.530 --> 38:23.623
- REALLY?

38:23.660 --> 38:25.321
- YOU SEE?

38:25.370 --> 38:26.962
FAKE DATING ISN'T ALL
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.831
- HAD ITS MOMENTS.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.030
- YOU MADE OUT
WITH A SERIAL KILLER.

38:30.070 --> 38:32.664
- YOU MADE OUT WITH LASSITER.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.029
- OKAY, I GUESS
THAT MAKES US EVEN.

38:34.070 --> 38:38.541
- JULES, I HAD A STARTLING
REVELATION THIS WEEK.

38:38.580 --> 38:41.105
THINK I'M READY
TO CO-HABITATE WITH SOMEONE.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.970
- REALLY?

38:43.020 --> 38:44.681
SOMEONE?

38:44.720 --> 38:45.846
- YEAH, I WAS GONNA PUT AN AD
IN CRAIGSLIST.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.085
BUT, I MEAN,
IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY...

38:48.120 --> 38:50.953
- [laughs]
- I'M WIDE OPEN.

38:50.990 --> 38:55.097
I, UH, LIKE THE WAY WE FIT.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.950
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
WHEN WE SPOON IT UP

38:57.000 --> 39:01.869
HALF-MOON STYLE,
ALTHOUGH THAT'S TIGHT.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.666
I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT WE MOVED IN TOGETHER.

39:08.610 --> 39:09.872
- THAT DOESN'T SCARE YOU?

39:09.910 --> 39:11.969
- THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
BELIEVE ME.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.570
I JUST REALIZED THAT I HAVEN'T
LIVED IN THE SAME APARTMENT

39:14.620 --> 39:17.714
FOR MORE THAN THREE MONTHS
SINCE I MET YOU.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.913
AND...HOME...

39:20.950 --> 39:24.625
SHOULD BE
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.753
AND THE DOGS
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET,

39:26.790 --> 39:27.859
RELATIVELY SOON.

39:27.890 --> 39:30.723
SO WHEREVER YOU...

39:30.760 --> 39:33.923
AND THE FLEET OF PUGS ARE...

39:33.970 --> 39:36.393
THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.102
- I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY.

39:39.140 --> 39:41.404
ABOUT PUGS.
- GOOD, GOOD.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.771
BECAUSE YOU CAN FIT
THEIR LITTLE FACES

39:42.810 --> 39:43.879
RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.468
- THEY JUST SQUISH
RIGHT IN THERE.

39:45.510 --> 39:47.603
- JUST EAT THEIR LITTLE FACES
RIGHT OFF.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.174
- SO WHAT MADE YOU SO SURE?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.882
- I LEARNED A LOT THIS WEEK,
MOVING BACK IN WITH MY DAD.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.811
I-I LEARNED YOU CAN'T GO BACK
TO YOUR CHILDHOOD HOME.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.579
- NO, THAT'S JUST A PLACE
THAT LIVES IN YOUR HEAD.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.757
- NO, I MEAN, LITERALLY, I CAN'T
GO BACK TO THAT HOUSE, EVER,

40:00.790 --> 40:03.054
EVER AGAIN,
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.193
EVER.
I SAW MY PARENTS DOING IT.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.790
- [gaSPSJ
WHAT?

40:07.830 --> 40:09.468
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.730
- IT WAS HORRIFYING.
IT WAS JUST A SERIES OF LIMBS.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.032
LIKE, MORE LIMBS
THAN MADE SENSE.

40:13.070 --> 40:15.937
AND OLD PERSONS' SKIN
AND PRIMAL NOISES.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.538
- NOISES?
- NOISES LIKE AN AARDVARK.

40:17.580 --> 40:19.002
I AM SO SORRY.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.699
- YOU WANT
TO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE CRAZY?

40:20.750 --> 40:22.047
- YES.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.983
- I'M GOING
TO KISS YOU ON THE MOUTH NOW.

40:27.020 --> 40:30.183
LIVE WITH ME.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.825
- OKAY.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.897
[computer keys clicking]
- BOOM.

40:37.930 --> 40:39.761
GOOD-BYE,
SINGLE GUS.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.892
- I KNOW I MAY HAVE FELT
A LITTLE THREATENED

40:40.930 --> 40:42.636
BY YOU AND RACHEL,
AT THE BEGINNING.

40:42.670 --> 40:45.468
BUT I...
I AM VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.068
- THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.577
- I ONLY HALF-MEAN IT.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.032
I STILL FEEL A LITTLE
TH REATEN ED.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.229
- I KNOW, BUT MY RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T QUITE WHERE

40:51.280 --> 40:52.907
YOU AND JULIET'S ARE YET.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.872
BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE.
- EASY, TIGER.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.844
BABY STEPS, RIGHT?
THESE THINGS ARE DELICATE.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.087
TAKE IT SLOWLY.
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.088
- MM-HMM.
- MAYBE BREAK UP.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.189
[knock on door]

41:03.220 --> 41:06.781
- HEY!
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

41:06.830 --> 41:07.979
- I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING,
AM I?

41:08.030 --> 41:09.952
- NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.525
- WE WERE SORT OF--
both: MMM.

41:12.570 --> 41:13.662
- THAT'S FINE.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.497
- HELLO, BOO.

41:15.540 --> 41:18.839
- MMM, THAT'S THE SWEET KIND
OF KISSES I WAS LOOKING FOR.

41:18.870 --> 41:20.565
- "HELLO, BOO."

41:20.610 --> 41:21.975
- YOU DON'T GET TO USE BOO,
SHAWN.

41:22.010 --> 41:24.672
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

41:24.710 --> 41:27.008
WELL, LOOK, RACHEL,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT

41:27.050 --> 41:27.869
I'M NOT GONNA BE ACCUSING YOU
OF MURDER AGAIN

41:27.910 --> 41:29.719
ANY TIME SOON.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.115
AND I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU,
AND I'M SORRY.

41:31.150 --> 41:33.084
AND IT'S CLEAR THAT NOT EVERYONE
ON THE INTERNET

41:33.120 --> 41:34.985
IS A LIAR AND A...

41:35.020 --> 41:36.556
THIEF AND A HARLOT.

41:36.590 --> 41:39.650
- THANKS, AND I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I RECOGNIZE

41:39.690 --> 41:41.089
YOU AND GUS POOPED TOGETHER.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.951
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,
AND I'D NEVER INTERFERE

41:44.000 --> 41:47.299
WITH THAT FRIENDSHIP.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.037
- I'M GONNA GO GET SOME SNACKS.
WHO'D LIKE SNACKS?

41:50.070 --> 41:51.731
- I'D LOVE AN APPLE, THANKS.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.032
- I SAID SNACKS.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.732
WHICH...MEANS AN APPLE.

41:58.040 --> 42:01.043
- [chuckles]
- YOU KNOW...

42:01.080 --> 42:02.775
THIS IS WEIRD.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.583
I KNOW IT'S A BRAND-NEW
RELATIONSHIP,

42:04.620 --> 42:05.882
BUT I FEEL SO CLOSE TO YOU.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.945
- IT'S NOT WEIRD.
I FEEL THE SAME.

42:07.990 --> 42:09.912
- I FEEL COMFORTABLE,
LIKE I CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING

42:09.960 --> 42:11.985
THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO SAY TO OTHER GUYS,

42:12.030 --> 42:13.782
AND CERTAINLY NOT SO SOON.

42:13.830 --> 42:16.321
- BOO, YOU CAN TELL ME
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.158
I'M READY FOR IT ALL.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.930
- OOH!
HEY, MAX.

42:21.970 --> 42:23.733
GUS, THIS IS MY SON MAXIMUS.

42:23.770 --> 42:25.704
MAXIMUS, AS I'VE TOLD YOU
SO MANY TIMES,

42:25.740 --> 42:27.230
NOT TO DO IT INDOORS
ON THE FLOOR.

42:27.270 --> 42:29.977

42:30.010 --> 42:31.648
BUT THAT'S THE BEST
THAT I CAN DO.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.079
HOLY CRAP! WHO'S THAT?
