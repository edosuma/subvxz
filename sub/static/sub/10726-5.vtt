Um, okay, let's start
with something mellow.

08:34.655 --> 08:36.321
Oh, like this one.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.322
"Office party."

08:37.390 --> 08:38.423
I mean, it's at work.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.323
People can't misbehave too much, right?

[Computer chimes]

08:42.061 --> 08:43.160
- Whoa, Nelly!
- Oh, god!

08:43.229 --> 08:44.829
That's not mellow. It's not mellow.

08:44.898 --> 08:46.160
There are so many people at this party.

08:46.185 --> 08:46.721
Far too many.

08:46.766 --> 08:50.134
Come on, I just wanted to see nice
men doing normal gay stuff.

08:50.203 --> 08:51.368
Yeah, me too.

08:51.437 --> 08:53.004
To be supportive. I'm
trying to be supportive.

08:53.072 --> 08:54.806
Why don't we search for something else?

08:54.874 --> 08:56.339
- Not to be homophobic.
- No, you're not homophobic.

[Computer chiming]

[Computer chiming rapidly]

09:07.019 --> 09:08.451
Oh, god! What's happening now?

09:08.520 --> 09:11.021
Wha... why are all
these windows popping up?

09:11.089 --> 09:12.222
Dude, it's a pornado.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.656
Shut it down. Click it off now! Kenny!

09:14.725 --> 09:16.826
- It's not stopping.
- It's getting worse.

09:16.894 --> 09:18.627
So many close-ups, and
that one's straight porn.

09:18.696 --> 09:20.196
- Be consistent!
- Where does it end?

09:20.264 --> 09:21.630
God. I just wanted
to find someone to like.

09:21.699 --> 09:22.865
I can't handle this!

09:22.934 --> 09:25.167
Don't leave me with all
the butts in my face!

09:25.236 --> 09:26.869
Not to be homophobic!

09:26.938 --> 09:29.171
You know I'm not one
to hand out compliments,

09:29.240 --> 09:31.072
but I look amazing.

09:31.141 --> 09:32.406
You look so great.

I'll drive you for moral support.

You've been drinking since noon.

Oh, wait. My computer with my pictures.

You like my baskets?

09:55.264 --> 09:58.365
You're welcome, Mr. President.

10:01.287 --> 10:03.888
Okay, let's just reboot the
computer, clear the history,

10:03.956 --> 10:05.390
and then I'll go sit
quietly in my bedroom

10:05.458 --> 10:08.359
and live a lonely
life of sexless reflection.

10:08.428 --> 10:10.160
Where's the computer?

10:10.229 --> 10:12.329
Maybe the pornado blew it off the bed.

10:12.399 --> 10:14.198
Shannon, did you take the laptop?!

10:14.267 --> 10:17.101
Shannon: No, I think mom did.

10:17.169 --> 10:18.301
What's wrong?

10:20.105 --> 10:22.406
The computer got a porn
virus. If mom opens it...

10:22.474 --> 10:25.409
What is on the computer
will literally melt her face off.

10:25.477 --> 10:27.010
Like at the end of "Indiana Jones."

10:27.078 --> 10:29.579

fewer Nazis and way more bronzer.

[Laughs]

10:32.284 --> 10:34.850
I'm sorry. This is really funny for me.

10:34.919 --> 10:36.919
Horrible for you and
Mom, though. Totally see that.

We got to get it
back before she opens it.

10:38.523 --> 10:40.122

10:40.190 --> 10:42.224
Ooh, she's on an Internet date.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.592
- Wh... already?
- What?

10:43.661 --> 10:45.795
Great, I'm gonna die
alone and Mom is killing it.

10:45.863 --> 10:47.062
She's already dating? That's... no.

10:47.131 --> 10:48.131
This... this is too soon.

10:48.198 --> 10:49.298
What would she even wear on a date?

She's got regular
khakis and capri khakis.

- Really?

10:52.436 --> 10:54.769
Why would Mom take a computer on a date?

10:54.838 --> 10:56.971
Well, she's pretty dumb about computers.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.320
She might think an Internet date

10:58.341 --> 11:00.241
means you actually have
to be on the Internet.

the computer for some school stuff.

between Dad seeing Mom on a date

I know I should be wagging
my finger at you guys,

12:03.836 --> 12:06.036
but this reminds me of
a time in high school

12:06.105 --> 12:07.705
when I rented a little adult film

12:07.773 --> 12:09.640
about some young
ladies at a summer camp.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.008
It got stuck in the VCR.

12:13.245 --> 12:14.812
Dad, it's not that kind of movie.

12:14.881 --> 12:17.213
I know, I get it. It's Kenny's
kind. But it's fine.

12:17.281 --> 12:19.048
Still normal stuff for
boys to be looking at.

12:19.117 --> 12:20.277
No, Dad, this was not normal.

12:20.284 --> 12:23.185
It was advanced,

they cut open the shark

12:31.195 --> 12:33.129
No. No. That's the whole point, Dad.

12:33.197 --> 12:35.330
I was watching this stuff
'cause I have no idea what I'm into,

12:35.399 --> 12:36.879
then I was gonna start online dating,

12:36.934 --> 12:39.801

asking what kind of animals I like.

already? I still have marriage eyes.

be great on the grill

and he'll use your
barbecue, and that'll hurt,

14:10.778 --> 14:12.911
but we'll still visit
you and the triplets

14:12.980 --> 14:15.247
in your condo on the lake,
and that'll be nice, right?

14:15.316 --> 14:18.317
I bet he'll teach you how to ski, too.

know, just get going.

out about this as you are, okay?

gonna have to worry

find attractive about him.

No, don't think that's a good idea.

to kind of thaw on the
idea of me being gay.

14:46.879 --> 14:48.144
If she sees what's on that computer,

14:48.213 --> 14:49.747
she will never speak to me again.

14:49.815 --> 14:51.114
Okay.

gonna go ahead and say it.

eyes you can get lost in.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.130
with the edible
arrangements boom was tough,

15:08.199 --> 15:11.401
but the bloom is
definitely off of that rose,

pineapple into a flower

is if you save the hard middle part.

ideas for your shop.

15:40.730 --> 15:44.364
I think, actually, even more important
than "work experience"

15:44.434 --> 15:46.266
is that I've been making gift baskets

15:46.335 --> 15:48.536
for school and
church auctions for years.

15:48.604 --> 15:50.370

15:50.440 --> 15:51.839
Oh, don't worry about that.

15:51.908 --> 15:55.207
You wouldn't be actually
making the Baskets.

15:55.276 --> 15:57.510
That's... my job.

15:57.579 --> 16:00.379
Oh. Well, um, I also love to bake,

16:00.449 --> 16:03.416

Whoa. Hard to beat that.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.992

16:14.061 --> 16:16.394
So, uh, if I wouldn't be doing Biscotti

16:16.464 --> 16:18.464
and I wouldn't be doing Baskets,

16:18.532 --> 16:22.400
what would I be doing at
biscotti and baskets?

16:22.470 --> 16:25.871

whatever-I-need sort of gal.

That guy does not ski.

16:47.559 --> 16:51.795
Mom's into koala bears. Huh.

How you doing?

17:09.646 --> 17:11.680
My name's Pat, and as you
can see, I carry a gun.

17:11.749 --> 17:13.448
It's not a threat, just a fact.

17:13.518 --> 17:16.284
Please write down your
income and pass it back to me.

I am so sorry, Michael-Gregory.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.433
I know this is very unprofessional.

17:32.502 --> 17:34.168
Oh, I don't care.

17:34.237 --> 17:36.603
You seem mean and I
like that. [Chuckles]

17:36.672 --> 17:38.772
Besides, it's not Biscotti
and brain surgery.

17:38.841 --> 17:40.541
You got the job.

17:40.609 --> 17:41.508
- I do?

But I-I'm gonna have to pass.

17:54.889 --> 17:56.055
What?

17:59.594 --> 18:01.894
Well, I... Think I have more to offer

18:01.963 --> 18:03.162
than you're looking for,

18:03.230 --> 18:05.230
and now that I know I can get a job,

18:05.299 --> 18:08.867
I-I'd rather wait for something
more worthy of my time.

18:08.936 --> 18:11.069
I get that.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.672
But sometimes you aim for Broadway

18:13.740 --> 18:15.974
and land at biscotti and Baskets.

18:16.043 --> 18:17.576
Good luck.

18:17.644 --> 18:19.510
Mm.

[Bell over door rings]

18:30.155 --> 18:31.288
I'm so glad to hear you say that,

18:31.356 --> 18:33.423
'cause I'm definitely
not ready to date, either.

18:33.492 --> 18:37.061
- Good.
- [Chuckles]

18:37.129 --> 18:38.996
Maybe we should lay
down some ground rules

for when we are ready.

18:40.232 --> 18:42.199
Mm. Mm-hmm. No firemen.
