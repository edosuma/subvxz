00:00.933 --> 00:04.251
<i>The second we got to the Abacos
for the janitor's wedding,</i>

00:04.371 --> 00:06.118
<i>Dr. Kelso, well...</i>

00:06.416 --> 00:08.562
<i>He set up shop at the bar.</i>

00:10.502 --> 00:12.710
That's the best Bahama
Mama I've ever had.

00:12.830 --> 00:16.431
I'll be the judge of that.
Hi, Bob Kelso. Excuse me.

00:20.119 --> 00:21.082
Mercy.

00:22.149 --> 00:24.651
If you would be so kind
as to store this for me,

00:24.771 --> 00:26.622
we could get this party started.

00:26.889 --> 00:28.607
One Bahama Mama, please.

00:30.234 --> 00:32.198
You can have this back
when mine comes.

00:34.037 --> 00:36.431
<i>Things weren't going
that well for the rest of us.</i>

00:36.812 --> 00:40.078
<i>Jordan wasn't happy with Dr. Cox
for pretending he had work to do.</i>

00:40.852 --> 00:44.818
<i>Elliot was mad at me for never saying
"I love you" in a romantic enough way.</i>

00:46.603 --> 00:48.650
<i>And Carla was so busy being a mom...</i>

00:48.770 --> 00:51.471
# Hush, little baby, don't say a word

00:51.591 --> 00:53.166
# Mama's gonna buy you

00:53.286 --> 00:55.649
- # a mockingbird.
- <i>She left Turk alone at sea.</i>

01:01.931 --> 01:03.064
Hey, what's up?

01:08.416 --> 01:09.410
Ma'am!

01:12.551 --> 01:13.557
Lady?

01:15.944 --> 01:17.366
What's up, Blaquaman?

01:17.609 --> 01:20.453
- I think I just saw a mermaid.
- Maybe you just spooked it.

01:21.921 --> 01:23.655
Oh, cute looking eel.

01:24.687 --> 01:27.184
- No, I'm naked.
- Alright, that's you.

01:27.427 --> 01:30.444
I was supposed to meet Carla
out here for a little "surf and Turk".

01:30.872 --> 01:32.375
Took off my swim trunks.

01:32.594 --> 01:34.409
These bad boys just floated away.

01:36.132 --> 01:38.933
Elliot's mad at me because
I didn't say "I love you" right.

01:40.513 --> 01:42.507
You know what?
That eel is looking at me funny,

01:42.627 --> 01:45.686
- I'm gonna switch over here.
- Yeah, he's got a mind of his own.

01:46.217 --> 01:48.818
Plus, I needed to say
how much I loved her.

01:48.938 --> 01:51.350
And I needed to be
looking right into her eyes.

01:51.581 --> 01:54.321
Well, what's the difference?
Look at me and say it.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.034
I love you.

01:59.288 --> 02:00.687
That's about right.

02:01.508 --> 02:03.276
And you're naked. Perfect.

02:03.593 --> 02:05.674
Either one of you two idiots
seen my computer?

02:05.929 --> 02:07.536
Maybe the mermaid took it.

02:08.102 --> 02:09.639
He's not great in the heat.

02:10.079 --> 02:11.524
I did see a mermaid.

02:12.648 --> 02:16.625
<i>Plus, the janitor wanted to kill me for
forcing him to have a wedding ceremony.</i>

02:17.704 --> 02:19.930
If I'm gonna have a ceremony,
I just need a little help.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.933
Go sunscreen up again and call
an emergency meeting of the Brain Trust.

02:23.053 --> 02:24.817
Island style. Where's Todd?

02:24.937 --> 02:28.408
Last time I saw him, he was stuffing
seaweed into his bathing suit.

02:28.859 --> 02:30.180
Sure. Where's Doug?

02:30.300 --> 02:33.532
Oh, no! I forgot
to give him his invite.

02:33.868 --> 02:36.816
He's getting married and
he didn't invite any of us?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.642
Oh come on!

02:39.762 --> 02:42.028
And carrying around
your invitation is just stupid!

02:42.148 --> 02:43.487
You look stupid!

02:44.265 --> 02:48.265
Book Doug into the next "Dealing
with rejection" seminar in my garage.

02:48.959 --> 02:49.889
80 bucks.

02:50.009 --> 02:52.560
80 bucks! Can I take that class?

02:52.779 --> 02:54.097
No room for you, Ted.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.848
Oh, man!

02:56.241 --> 02:57.801
That's not dealing with rejection.

02:57.921 --> 02:59.791
I can work wonders
with you, my friend.

03:01.454 --> 03:03.912
- One hundred bucks.
- Hundred bucks!

03:04.032 --> 03:05.280
Sweet!

Season 8 Episode 15
My Soul On Fire: Part 2

03:24.766 --> 03:27.425
Salad tastes like sunscreen.

03:27.714 --> 03:29.703
That's because you put sunscreen on it.

03:31.474 --> 03:34.804
Oh, man! I put Ranch on my face.

03:34.924 --> 03:35.674
Alright.

03:35.794 --> 03:39.427
Welcome to the 2nd international
meeting of the Brain Trust.

03:39.861 --> 03:42.742
I'll begin this as I began the
meeting six years ago in Guatemala.

03:42.862 --> 03:44.902
I'm getting married tomorrow.
And I need help.

03:45.022 --> 03:47.040
Ted, you're in charge
of location and music.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.868
Todd, you are in charge of
locating a Justice of the Peace...

03:50.109 --> 03:52.492
and finding a sea turtle
to serve as a ring bearer.

03:52.763 --> 03:54.238
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

03:58.961 --> 04:00.059
Who is this dude?

04:00.313 --> 04:01.413
That is Ira.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.908
As per our bylaws, the Brain Trust
must always have a fourth.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.559
Plus he can speak
to dolphins. Or so he says.

04:06.679 --> 04:07.750
Drink.

04:10.571 --> 04:11.484
Drink.

04:13.733 --> 04:15.202
- The man's a born leader.
- Drink!

04:17.511 --> 04:19.488
- You know what? Let's...
- Drink, damn it!

04:23.280 --> 04:25.684
<i>Time to smooth
things over with Elliot.</i>

04:26.148 --> 04:27.767
Seagull!

04:28.669 --> 04:29.605
Hey, baby!

04:30.256 --> 04:32.961
Check out this awesome place
Turk and I found this morning.

04:33.081 --> 04:36.966
It's called Tahiti Beach and it's out
like right in the middle of the ocean.

04:37.086 --> 04:39.972
We got a kid to videotape us,
but it was good you weren't there,

04:40.092 --> 04:42.922
because he has red hair,
I know how that nauseates you.

04:43.609 --> 04:46.176
That's us doing some muscle poses.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.604
Look how firm Turk looks.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.826
Anyway, that's when we realized
the kid was trying to steal the camera.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.381
Dude.

04:55.248 --> 04:56.866
My wife gave me that camera!

04:56.986 --> 04:59.644
His mistake was running
backwards with the camera on us.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.279
Are you out of your mind?

05:01.779 --> 05:04.152
<i>Unfortunately,
the smoothing over didn't work.</i>

05:04.522 --> 05:06.707
So we're not gonna
talk about yesterday?

05:07.793 --> 05:09.100
<i>For anyone.</i>

05:09.220 --> 05:11.490
So we are not gonna
talk about yesterday?

05:14.242 --> 05:16.242
So we're not gonna
talk about yesterday?

05:19.565 --> 05:21.811
There's nothing really
to talk about, sweetie.

05:21.931 --> 05:24.181
You were a little crazy
before, now it's over.

05:24.447 --> 05:26.895
What is so crazy about
wanting to hear "I love you"

05:27.015 --> 05:29.081
in a meaningful and romantic way?

05:29.324 --> 05:31.142
Oh, good. It's not over.

05:32.101 --> 05:36.113
So you just wasted a whole vacation day
pretending to work just to mess with me?

05:36.418 --> 05:39.619
I recall you saying that you were
happy I couldn't spend time with you.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.513
You knew I wasn't serious.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.562
That's how we interact.
That's our thing.

05:43.682 --> 05:46.682
You know what? I'm sick of
pretending we don't like each other,

05:46.802 --> 05:50.360
It is distinctly not fun anymore.
Would you like to know why? Because A,

05:50.580 --> 05:52.453
We are over 12. And B...

05:53.134 --> 05:56.440
We actually do like each other.
In fact, brace yourself...

05:57.053 --> 05:58.232
We love each other.

06:01.103 --> 06:03.184
I can't believe you
left me out there yesterday.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.756
I was in the ocean for so long I had
jellyfish stings on my ding-a-ling

06:06.876 --> 06:08.740
I had to make sure Izzy fell asleep.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.941
Why do you have to be
a mommy all the time?

06:11.965 --> 06:14.416
I still make sure you get sex
at least once a week.

06:14.536 --> 06:17.942
Yeah, but you always start with
"This has to be quickie".

06:18.358 --> 06:20.347
Why do you always say that?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.845
Baby, we both know my
"longies" aren't that long.

06:23.065 --> 06:26.070
I gotta be honest with you, sometimes
it makes me feel like you don't love me.

06:26.301 --> 06:30.197
On behalf of all women, I just want to
thank you for equating sex with love.

06:30.317 --> 06:32.555
We think it's awesome
when you do that.

06:33.452 --> 06:34.484
You're welcome.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.868
No, I know he's upset. But just
put him on the phone, okay, Carol?

06:42.192 --> 06:43.279
Hey, buddy.

06:43.501 --> 06:46.021
I guess you're pretty bummed
about the wedding mix-up, huh?

06:46.141 --> 06:48.495
No, man. I got a lot going on here.

06:48.615 --> 06:50.784
So what's it like there?
Is it awesome?

06:51.301 --> 06:52.896
It's pretty awesome.

06:53.016 --> 06:54.641
Yeah, I thought it would be.

06:54.761 --> 06:55.905
You know what, pal?

06:56.025 --> 06:58.841
I'm gonna stay on this
phone with you... I gotta go.

06:59.743 --> 07:01.454
Carol, close me up.

07:05.781 --> 07:08.335
So, I found you
a Justice of the Peace.

07:08.455 --> 07:10.316
Say hello to Van.

07:10.975 --> 07:13.148
- Van?
- Van. Stretch it out.

07:15.020 --> 07:16.292
I drive one of you.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.644
You're right not to laugh.
That was stupid.

07:19.764 --> 07:20.592
Thanks.

07:20.892 --> 07:23.311
- Where d'you find this idiot?
- Man got me through med school.

07:23.431 --> 07:25.901
He's the dude we used to
practice all the rectal exams on.

07:26.021 --> 07:28.687
We did a couple of them
right here in this very bar.

07:29.337 --> 07:30.436
Right there.

07:30.944 --> 07:32.077
With you.

07:32.548 --> 07:34.930
I find that both
fascinating and disgusting.

07:38.251 --> 07:39.717
You already know I love you.

07:39.837 --> 07:43.808
I shouldn't have to make some crazy
gesture. I'm not a big fan of those.

07:43.928 --> 07:47.916
You went online for three hours and
spent a fortune getting a tiki for Turk.

07:48.532 --> 07:50.914
Elliot, I don't really think $456

07:51.034 --> 07:54.197
for an actual faux marble
imitation tiki is a fortune.

07:54.595 --> 07:56.838
- Was that total or each?
- That's irrelevant.

07:57.889 --> 08:00.953
Weren't you the one who said we are
past this dumb relationship drama?

08:01.073 --> 08:02.771
And I meant it. Then.

08:02.891 --> 08:05.614
- But you don't now?
- I'm a girl. That's how it works.

08:06.622 --> 08:09.234
And guess what.
All relationships have drama.

08:09.354 --> 08:11.434
When a woman says there
doesn't have to be any drama,

08:11.554 --> 08:14.336
it's because she's so excited there's
no drama at that particular moment

08:14.456 --> 08:17.269
she can't wait to share that feeling
with you before there's any new drama!

08:17.497 --> 08:20.768
I want you to be comforted by the fact
that doesn't sound ridiculous at all.

08:21.566 --> 08:24.976
We're at a wedding! Why can't
you not get to a romantic place?

08:25.096 --> 08:26.507
It's not a real wedding!

08:26.627 --> 08:30.289
It's a crazy cleaning
person's scam for presents.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.028
Then by all means,
continue being an ass.

08:34.318 --> 08:37.116
And do you want to know
why I'm a mommy all the time ?

08:37.236 --> 08:38.134
Please.

08:38.254 --> 08:40.561
It's because I <i>am</i> a mommy.

08:40.885 --> 08:42.850
All the time.

08:43.265 --> 08:46.422
I have a baby at home.
I have one in here.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.133
And I have another one!

08:48.352 --> 08:50.721
Who expects me to
work, raise his kids,

08:50.841 --> 08:53.260
buy his clothes,
make his food, run his life

08:53.380 --> 08:56.964
and still have all the energy in the
world left to sex him up every night.

08:57.084 --> 08:59.958
Even though his longies are
actually pretty damn long.

09:00.281 --> 09:01.333
I know, right?

09:03.530 --> 09:07.394
You obviously know how I feel about
you. Why are you trying to change me?

09:07.514 --> 09:10.111
This... That works for us.

09:10.412 --> 09:13.799
Remember when my dog died and
you told me he went to doggy hell.

09:13.919 --> 09:17.316
And then you said my mom was gonna
go to doggy hell too when she died.

09:17.547 --> 09:19.223
Because of her dog face.

09:19.454 --> 09:20.459
Right.

09:20.579 --> 09:23.037
I've wanted to do you
right there in the vet's office.

09:23.157 --> 09:26.193
Why are you trying to change
our dynamic? I don't want to.

09:26.743 --> 09:29.734
Suit yourself.
Just leave me alone.

09:31.448 --> 09:33.102
Just leave me alone.

09:34.896 --> 09:36.353
Just leave me alone.

09:36.861 --> 09:38.965
Fine. I'll see you at the wedding.

09:39.085 --> 09:40.656
Smile for the camera, honey.

09:43.352 --> 09:44.345
Excuse me.

09:44.602 --> 09:46.543
Payback time. Let's go.

09:46.983 --> 09:47.908
But I...

09:48.138 --> 09:49.528
- Really?
- Let's go.

09:49.648 --> 09:50.730
Bye boys!

09:50.850 --> 09:53.940
- You're okay with this?
- I gotta let my man be my man.

09:55.403 --> 09:56.223
Stop it.

09:56.498 --> 09:58.625
- Babe, don't be late for the wedding.
- Shut up!

09:58.998 --> 10:00.223
You shut up!

10:03.518 --> 10:06.076
<i>The janitor's wedding day
seemed like any other.</i>

10:08.342 --> 10:10.561
- Good morning, Bob.
- Good morning, Gary.

10:10.885 --> 10:12.376
One Bahama Mama, please.

10:12.703 --> 10:15.304
And if you could, the
electric razor from my bag.

10:16.298 --> 10:17.090
Thanks.

10:21.661 --> 10:24.528
For god's sake, Ted, get some sun.

10:25.132 --> 10:28.069
- I've not sunscreened up yet.
- Live a little.

10:37.065 --> 10:39.134
It's warmer than I thought.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.381
Damn you, Mother Earth!

10:50.236 --> 10:51.832
Damn you!

10:55.489 --> 10:56.749
Why?

11:01.639 --> 11:04.402
Here's the incredibly
breathtaking view of Hope Town,

11:04.522 --> 11:06.864
And... Well, what do you know?

11:06.984 --> 11:08.990
It's JD. What's he doing here?

11:09.110 --> 11:11.409
Well, he made me
change my wedding plans.

11:11.529 --> 11:14.600
And as punishment, he's got to spend
ten minutes on top of this lighthouse.

11:15.683 --> 11:18.007
- That's all I gotta do?
- That's it, my friend.

11:18.565 --> 11:20.877
Then how come I got
this fish taped to my hands?

11:22.669 --> 11:23.906
Seagulls!

11:28.751 --> 11:31.064
- Sike! None for you, preggers.
- Damn it!

11:31.948 --> 11:33.546
Do I look like Audrey Hepburn?

11:34.078 --> 11:35.445
Yes, of course.

11:35.565 --> 11:37.418
Crap, he hates Audrey Hepburn.

11:37.538 --> 11:39.487
No, no. You look beautiful.

11:39.876 --> 11:41.252
Let me fix your hair.

11:42.813 --> 11:44.269
Thanks, guys.

11:44.827 --> 11:47.024
I just wanna look great
for my honey bunny.

11:47.144 --> 11:48.885
That's my nickname for him.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.429
He also loves it cause
it's his favorite sandwich.

11:53.047 --> 11:56.273
I feel like I finally found
the perfect man, you know?

11:56.393 --> 11:58.692
Oh, please. There's no such thing.

11:58.957 --> 12:02.012
Look at Perry. He pretends he's cold
and emotionless, but underneath

12:02.132 --> 12:05.115
he's a sweet guy who wants to talk
about our relationship all the time.

12:05.235 --> 12:08.164
Face it. Men are just gassy,
selfish, sex-crazed egomaniacs

12:08.284 --> 12:11.333
who were put on this earth to
make your life miserable, that's it.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.221
I'm getting married in like ten minutes.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.203
You'll live.

12:14.608 --> 12:17.787
Lady, are this some roots
I'm seeing? This is not your color?

12:17.907 --> 12:19.594
No, i'm actually a redhead.

12:21.536 --> 12:23.559
I'm just gonna grab
a sip of my drink.

12:23.679 --> 12:25.631
I touched it, it's all over me!

12:27.342 --> 12:29.264
- Go take a shower.
- Thank you.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.919
Nice hat. Does it
come in a human size?

12:38.039 --> 12:38.970
Shut up.

12:42.712 --> 12:45.059
A hungry seabird pooed on my shirt.

12:45.883 --> 12:48.252
Go get a new one from the
gift shop, you're gonna miss it.

12:48.372 --> 12:50.907
- Do you think they sell this shirt?
- You're an idiot.

12:53.873 --> 12:54.925
Wait, baby.

12:55.045 --> 12:56.809
- What?
- It's the mermaid.

12:58.713 --> 13:00.519
Then what doesn't she have a tail?

13:00.820 --> 13:02.415
Because she's on land.

13:06.022 --> 13:08.661
Oh my god,
this is the father of my child.

13:09.169 --> 13:11.620
Come on, come on.
We're waiting. Come on.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.788
Alright, I am not
a strong public speaker,

13:14.908 --> 13:18.802
nor am I that familiar with the Bible,
so we will do what we can.

13:19.414 --> 13:22.963
Now, if you're excited, for our wedding
today, let me hear you say wooh!

13:23.083 --> 13:25.403
Just like that, it's fun if you
throw your shoulders back.

13:26.612 --> 13:28.392
- Try it.
- We're not gonna do that.

13:28.512 --> 13:30.496
Okay, doesn't want to do that.
Here we go.

13:30.616 --> 13:32.380
These guys are getting married today.

13:33.111 --> 13:36.415
And as a special treat, they thought
it would be nice if you all stood,

13:36.535 --> 13:38.776
and they were to sit.
So, shall we?

13:42.944 --> 13:46.135
Alright then, it is now
time to join these two

13:46.458 --> 13:48.262
as only the Creator can.

13:48.382 --> 13:50.377
- Where's Bob?
- He's right over there.

13:53.927 --> 13:54.852
Of course.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.638
- It's hot!
- Too bad.

14:01.270 --> 14:04.105
Marriage is a dead institution.

14:04.429 --> 14:05.946
It hasn't worked for me.

14:06.258 --> 14:08.285
It hasn't worked
for anybody in my family.

14:08.405 --> 14:10.540
But there are certain
signposts you can follow

14:10.660 --> 14:12.392
to try and make the best of it.

14:12.512 --> 14:14.408
Try not to yell at each other.
A great idea.

14:14.528 --> 14:17.819
Don't share any money.
Always sound, sound advice.

14:18.211 --> 14:21.069
Never strike each other above
the shoulders. From here down.

14:21.189 --> 14:23.913
- From here down, forget it.
- <i>Even though it was a wedding,</i>

14:24.033 --> 14:26.434
<i>none of us were caught up
in the romance of the moment.</i>

14:26.554 --> 14:29.227
- <i>In fact before we knew it...</i>
- Don't share cars.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.731
You'll find that it always
has the other person stink on it.

14:31.851 --> 14:33.815
And you can't get
that stuff off your shirt,

14:33.935 --> 14:35.818
you're gonna live with it
for the rest of your life.

14:35.938 --> 14:38.428
You don't want it when
you're driving to work, you know?

14:39.383 --> 14:41.926
Before we knew it,
we were already here.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.848
Do you, Ladania Williams,

14:46.291 --> 14:50.210
take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

14:50.872 --> 14:51.785
I do.

14:53.277 --> 14:56.063
Oh my god. We were gonna
find out the janitor's name.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.054
And you...

15:00.990 --> 15:04.146
What? It's 4:37.
"High tide" five.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.522
<i>Damn it!</i>

15:05.849 --> 15:07.967
It's alright. We'll just
start again. No biggie.

15:08.268 --> 15:09.494
And you...

15:11.528 --> 15:13.309
That was off the burn!

15:15.126 --> 15:16.918
You know what we'll do?
We'll just say this.

15:17.038 --> 15:18.620
Do you take this lady

15:19.314 --> 15:21.915
to be your lawfully wedded lady?

15:23.435 --> 15:26.221
Of course you do. Look at her.
Looks like a ladybug.

15:26.848 --> 15:28.501
Can I just touch right there for...?

15:28.621 --> 15:30.051
You're done. Out.

15:31.246 --> 15:33.397
Terrible job. Good luck.

15:37.887 --> 15:40.130
I just wanna say something
before we kiss, okay?

15:40.557 --> 15:42.996
And thanks for coming,
even though I didn't want you here.

15:45.297 --> 15:46.580
I know that I'm weird.

15:47.216 --> 15:49.679
But, you know, you'd be weird too

15:49.799 --> 15:52.303
if your mother aged
backwards like mine did.

15:53.170 --> 15:55.104
So the thing is that I always kind of

15:55.647 --> 15:57.578
figured that I would end up alone.

15:58.780 --> 16:00.479
And then you came along.

16:00.930 --> 16:05.246
And you don't just accept my
quirks and my crazy stories

16:05.366 --> 16:08.259
and my lies about my mom,
you actually appreciate me for them.

16:09.490 --> 16:13.456
And I don't think I'll ever
stop appreciating you for that.

16:14.404 --> 16:16.589
But I know that I'll
never stop loving you for it.

16:17.551 --> 16:18.730
I love you too.

16:22.905 --> 16:26.824
<i>And right then, we all realized
the value of the romantic gesture.</i>

16:28.419 --> 16:30.477
<i>From one person who loves someone...</i>

16:32.399 --> 16:33.717
<i>To another.</i>

17:28.565 --> 17:30.048
I remember you.

17:31.886 --> 17:33.357
Wanna get in the water?

17:33.704 --> 17:34.779
Fo' shizzle.

17:48.516 --> 17:50.377
What time does that wedding start?

17:50.497 --> 17:52.091
Classic stuff Bob.

17:55.606 --> 17:57.239
Everything I do

17:57.586 --> 18:00.149
is more fun
if you're doing it with me.

18:01.146 --> 18:02.441
Was that so hard?

18:04.131 --> 18:05.068
Oh really?

18:05.923 --> 18:07.877
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

18:09.810 --> 18:11.709
Don't! Don't!

18:17.635 --> 18:18.768
I love you.

18:19.311 --> 18:20.386
I love you.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.031
Bahama Mama.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.748
Big Mama.

18:31.974 --> 18:33.719
God, it's so beautiful here.

18:36.279 --> 18:37.481
Look, Elliot.

18:38.582 --> 18:40.120
I don't know if it's possible

18:40.240 --> 18:43.334
for me to put how
I feel about you into words.

18:45.174 --> 18:47.003
But I guess I'll give it a shot.

18:47.688 --> 18:50.658
I had never really believed
I'd find somebody

18:50.778 --> 18:52.599
that I'd love as much as you.

18:55.052 --> 18:58.453
I love you more than
anything in the whole world.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.194
I love you more than Turk.

19:05.314 --> 19:07.287
- Oh my god.
- I know.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.580
That's even hard for
me to say but it's true.

19:11.448 --> 19:13.864
I had to wrestle him
to the ground to get this,

19:13.984 --> 19:16.246
but it's more
important for you to have it.

19:22.886 --> 19:23.936
Look at me.

19:25.869 --> 19:27.369
You're my dream girl.

19:36.612 --> 19:38.562
It's getting a little chilly.

20:05.322 --> 20:08.154
Hey Bob, you've been sitting
here for three days, now.

20:08.493 --> 20:10.974
Why don't you get up and
go see this beautiful island, man?

20:11.094 --> 20:12.469
You're right.

20:30.721 --> 20:33.414
I'll have a Bahama Mama, please.

20:35.977 --> 20:38.197
This is a beautiful place.
