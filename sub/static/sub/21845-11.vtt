00:09.330 --> 00:14.890
Tomorrow it’s his… you know. Why can’t we celebrate it?

00:14.890 --> 00:19.910
It’s a rare occasion, so why can’t we make it fantastic and lovely?

00:24.740 --> 00:27.080
I’m here!

00:27.930 --> 00:29.960
Lady Elizabeth!

01:59.970 --> 02:04.970
His Butler, Whatever Needs Be.

01:59.990 --> 02:04.990
<font size="50">His Butler,</font>

02:00.620 --> 02:04.990
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Whatever</font></font>

02:01.240 --> 02:04.990
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Needs</font></font>

02:01.870 --> 02:04.990
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Be</font></font>

02:08.139 --> 02:09.979
Ciel!

02:10.340 --> 02:11.110
Lizzy!

02:16.020 --> 02:17.790
Here! This is for you.

02:17.790 --> 02:19.400
Open it! Quick, quick!

02:25.440 --> 02:28.830
Wh—What? I thought I broke that!

02:28.830 --> 02:31.850
Ah, Sebastian repaired it.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.950
No way! It was all cracked!

02:33.950 --> 02:35.380
I don’t even see any flaws!

02:36.700 --> 02:38.610
Such skill is only natural for one…

02:38.610 --> 02:40.970
Who serves as a butler for the Phantomhives.

02:42.010 --> 02:43.600
Exactly as you say.

02:44.150 --> 02:47.600
I see. Sebastian…

02:48.100 --> 02:49.270
My Lady…

02:49.890 --> 02:52.900
Lady Elizabeth, what is in that little box?

02:53.470 --> 02:55.280
Ah, this is just, uh…

02:55.280 --> 02:55.980
A secret!

02:57.650 --> 03:00.240
Didn’t you just say you were going to give it to me?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.270
That was a feint!

03:04.270 --> 03:05.680
A feint?

03:05.680 --> 03:09.680
A lady who tries to catch a man with gifts is no lady.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.360
It’s unseemly!

03:11.360 --> 03:13.940
Now, Paula, ring your bells!

03:13.940 --> 03:15.610
Yes, my Lady!

03:15.610 --> 03:17.310
Jingle jingle jingle!

03:17.310 --> 03:18.800
Well then, good day to you!

03:22.620 --> 03:25.660
So what did she come over for, then?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.740
Tomorrow is your birthday, Young Master.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.060
Perhaps that was the reason?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.430
How about it, Young Master?

03:35.430 --> 03:37.880
Shall we hold a party?

03:37.880 --> 03:41.290
It looks as if there are others who are hoping to celebrate, too.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.460
My birthday…

04:01.420 --> 04:05.330
Um, you know, it’s my birthday today!

04:05.330 --> 04:07.090
Oh, Ciel, please…

04:07.090 --> 04:09.430
I’m so sorry. Please forgive him.

04:09.430 --> 04:12.480
It’s fine. He’s such a cute little lad.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.480
Mummy said that ’cause today is special, I can sleep with her tonight!

04:17.480 --> 04:19.209
She’s also going to read me a story,

04:19.209 --> 04:20.300
and then…

04:20.709 --> 04:22.750
On my birthday…

04:26.160 --> 04:28.470
Daddy! Mummy!

04:28.740 --> 04:29.490
Da—

04:35.270 --> 04:38.220
I was going to sleep with Mother.

04:38.850 --> 04:41.380
Father was going to give me a present.

04:42.770 --> 04:46.950
We will place the seal of the sublime beast upon you.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.520
I was so looking forward to it…

04:57.420 --> 04:59.870
To my birthday.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.560
Young Master?

05:05.560 --> 05:08.290
Ridiculous. Bring me tea in my room.

05:08.870 --> 05:09.830
Straight away.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.450
I wonder if it’s because of work on the Underground.

05:29.260 --> 05:33.410
My Lady, please look! Jingle jingle jingle!

05:33.410 --> 05:34.260
Paula.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.680
Yes? Jingle jingle!

05:35.950 --> 05:38.950
You always look so happy.

05:39.450 --> 05:40.940
I—I’m sorry!

05:40.940 --> 05:43.540
Oh, I’m not criticising you.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.120
I’m just envious. You’re so radiant, and you never seem to worry.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.590
My Lady, you’re normally quite carefree yourself…

05:52.620 --> 05:56.410
That aside, we really aren’t getting anywhere, are we?

05:56.410 --> 05:59.070
If we get stuck here until nightfall, what on earth will we do?

06:16.290 --> 06:20.700
Ah, but that might be kind of like camping, so it could be fun, my L—

06:21.720 --> 06:23.190
My Lady?

06:23.620 --> 06:25.500
My Lady!

07:06.760 --> 07:08.650
Welcome.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.670
That ring…

07:17.760 --> 07:24.290
How unfortunate. It has not chosen you as its master.

07:26.590 --> 07:30.050
However, your eyes…

07:32.600 --> 07:36.140
Ciel is the only man I…

07:36.140 --> 07:41.070
Your eyes have such tremendous depth and sadness in them.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.940
I can tell.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.900
They’re incredibly melancholic.

07:56.950 --> 08:00.370
I see. A birthday present.

08:00.370 --> 08:04.360
I wanted to cheer Ciel up.

08:07.210 --> 08:13.180
There are many wares here, and they are all wonderfully fantastic items.

08:31.990 --> 08:35.039
I shall give you whichever one you wish.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.120
Please choose whatever you will.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.059
But…

08:41.059 --> 08:42.520
I understand.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.630
To you, these are all the same.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.590
Therefore, I reason

08:50.590 --> 08:55.340
for a superior present, to be given to a very dear person,

08:55.770 --> 08:58.520
the most suitable thing would be…

09:03.600 --> 09:06.810
Your very self.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.780
Elizabeth has disappeared?

09:13.110 --> 09:13.820
Yes.

09:14.270 --> 09:18.320
I heard from her maid, who said she lost sight of her around Islington.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.190
We’ll move out immediately.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.370
For Heaven’s sake. What was she thinking?

09:22.370 --> 09:24.050
Before that, I have this for you.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.270
Scotland Yard is frantically continuing their search

09:31.270 --> 09:34.280
in the case where only young girls are kidnapped.

09:34.280 --> 09:38.040
The bodies of the girls have not been found, but most likely…

09:38.930 --> 09:44.260
The culprit sends out the Shard of Hope to those who would become targets.

09:44.260 --> 09:48.300
The mysterious gem that brings ill fortune to its owner.

09:49.800 --> 09:54.780
To return to the tale of this treasure, having previously failed to acquire it…

09:55.600 --> 09:56.990
What shall we do?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.360
We shall ease the Queen’s gloom.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.450
That is our highest priority.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.930
No matter what happens.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.100
Pardon the intrusion.

10:19.540 --> 10:23.810
I have made my master wait.

10:25.350 --> 10:28.670
Master, what should the doll be this time?

10:29.250 --> 10:35.120
Make it out of wax and stone, wax and stone, wax and stone.

10:35.120 --> 10:40.870
Make it out of wax and stone, my fair lady.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.700
Understood.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.510
Young Master?

10:51.510 --> 10:54.900
Open the carriage door.

10:54.930 --> 10:55.720
Yes?

10:56.120 --> 11:02.390
Go and question the victims’ families and make a list of suspects.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.470
We need names and addresses. Sneak into the crime scenes.

11:07.290 --> 11:10.140
You should be able to achieve all that within three hours, no?

11:12.100 --> 11:15.850
In the meantime, I will take care of some minor business.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.920
That is all.

11:18.380 --> 11:19.900
I see.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.320
Hurry up and get on with it.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.530
Yes, my Lord.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.030
Here it comes! I can feel it coming!

11:45.060 --> 11:47.930
My Hunk Radar is going off!

11:57.310 --> 12:00.300
She said she lost sight of her around here, but…

12:01.580 --> 12:03.640
Why do I have to be with this guy?

12:06.580 --> 12:08.410
Take this.

12:08.410 --> 12:10.630
Hopefully it will be of some use to you.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.630
Such as?

12:13.630 --> 12:17.540
If necessary, use it as bait and run away.

12:20.850 --> 12:22.160
Whatever.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.510
You’re a dog, right? You should be able to track scents, then.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.900
This ribbon from Lizzy’s present has her scent on it.

12:34.860 --> 12:38.860
The little… Won’t he listen to anything but what Sebastian tells him?

12:45.410 --> 12:47.880
Stop being in heat at a time like this!

12:49.030 --> 12:52.790
Oh, my. Men in heat make my heart thump!

12:57.600 --> 13:00.050
I am the hunter of love!

13:00.050 --> 13:04.010
This heart of mine burns up any prey I set my eyes on.

13:04.010 --> 13:06.840
It scatters deep crimson sparks!

13:08.710 --> 13:09.720
Red…

13:13.120 --> 13:17.450
Hunk sighted!

13:28.130 --> 13:29.160
You’re…

13:29.160 --> 13:33.040
Even like this, I’m a butler to <i>die</i>  for!

13:35.400 --> 13:39.540
Well, right now, I am not in active employment.

13:43.240 --> 13:49.090
Because of the Madam Red incident, I was demoted, and have nothing to do but boring, lowly jobs.

13:49.820 --> 13:55.590
That bastard Will told me I can’t return to work until I’ve retrieved some troublesome souls.

13:55.590 --> 13:57.230
That rotten sadist!

13:58.560 --> 14:02.120
Well, food is best just as it’s about to go rotten,

14:02.770 --> 14:06.690
and those cold eyes send chills up my spine.

14:07.220 --> 14:10.740
However, this one’s wildness is hard to ignore.

14:14.110 --> 14:18.620
You’re not about to tell me you’re going to take revenge for your beloved aunt, are you?

14:18.960 --> 14:19.790
Shut up.

14:19.790 --> 14:24.840
It looks like Sebastian isn’t around, either. What can a brat like you do?

14:24.840 --> 14:25.590
Shut up!

14:29.810 --> 14:31.670
Your knight tonight is him?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.350
Why does this kid steal all the good men?

14:36.460 --> 14:38.060
Oh, I’m being assaulted!

14:38.520 --> 14:41.020
Please be gentle!

14:43.270 --> 14:44.770
Hey! What is this?

14:58.110 --> 14:59.100
Lizzy!

14:59.480 --> 15:01.300
Grim Reaper Death Note:

15:01.300 --> 15:06.050
#403: Mandalay Family Puppeteer,

15:06.920 --> 15:09.260
Drozell Keinz.

15:22.730 --> 15:23.610
This is…

15:28.830 --> 15:29.870
Lizzy!

15:55.310 --> 15:59.220
There’s no doubt that Lizzy is in there.

16:00.890 --> 16:03.780
My, isn’t that a welcoming mansion?

16:05.100 --> 16:08.570
This man laid hands on Madam Red,

16:08.570 --> 16:11.110
but right now…

16:16.690 --> 16:19.450
Greil, protect me.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.870
I’ll listen to whatever your wish is.

16:22.870 --> 16:24.870
Don’t insult me.

16:24.870 --> 16:27.690
I’m not the kind of cheap woman who performs for mone—

16:27.690 --> 16:31.050
I’ll let you do whatever you want with Sebastian for one day.

16:32.230 --> 16:36.590
Whatever I want with Sebastian meaning… I can kiss him?

16:36.920 --> 16:38.650
Whatever you like.

16:38.650 --> 16:40.750
W—With tongue?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.910
That depends on how you play it.

16:44.410 --> 16:45.440
Understood!

16:47.070 --> 16:51.530
Motivation Meter at Maximum Death!

16:51.530 --> 16:57.130
Make it out of wax and stone, wax and stone, wax and stone.

16:57.130 --> 17:02.440
Make it out of wax and stone, my fair lady.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.790
Now, then! Let’s get a move on!

17:28.290 --> 17:32.480
Oh, that’s quite similar to the ring you have on.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.690
The Hope Diamond?

17:35.910 --> 17:37.460
This doll is…

17:41.040 --> 17:42.160
Impossible!

17:50.600 --> 17:51.560
Plut…

17:54.960 --> 17:56.840
You stupid mutt!

18:01.960 --> 18:06.020
Now, now! Don’t mistake which name you should be calling out.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.480
Greil!

18:10.010 --> 18:13.790
Reapers have tools to hunt souls with.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.690
Yes! Their death-scythes!

18:19.570 --> 18:21.910
Those are just normal scissors, right?

18:21.910 --> 18:23.620
I had no choice in the matter!

18:23.620 --> 18:26.790
Will took my custom death-scythe away!

18:26.790 --> 18:28.870
I long for those vibrations again!

18:30.220 --> 18:31.970
I’ll cut her to shreds!

18:32.860 --> 18:35.960
Wait! Don’t kill her! This isn’t a doll.

18:36.460 --> 18:39.830
Kiss in Heaven!

18:49.400 --> 18:51.770
It was just a doll after all, then?

18:53.550 --> 18:59.570
Mould it out of wood and clay, wood and clay, wood and clay. 

19:02.800 --> 19:06.740
This doll was a failure.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.710
I had thought

19:10.710 --> 19:15.170
they needed to be made much, much stronger.

19:17.990 --> 19:23.520
Make it out of iron and steel, iron and steel, iron and steel.

19:23.520 --> 19:28.610
Make it out of iron and steel, my fair lady.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.940
Those girls are…

19:34.160 --> 19:37.340
Those who interfere in the love between Sebastian and me…

19:37.800 --> 19:38.480
Greil!

19:38.900 --> 19:40.950
Will end up like this!

19:46.780 --> 19:47.540
So hard!

19:49.030 --> 19:51.000
Greil! This is an order.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.790
You and Pluto are to play with the dolls here

19:55.400 --> 19:56.580
forever!

20:02.260 --> 20:04.800
Do you plan to leave me here? How inhuman!

20:05.140 --> 20:06.790
Can a Reaper say that?

20:09.970 --> 20:14.100
The dolls look exactly like the kidnapped girls.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.580
No. Those are the girls themselves.

20:17.530 --> 20:18.710
Then,

20:18.710 --> 20:20.190
Elizabeth is…

20:24.550 --> 20:26.910
Ciel Phantomhive.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.870
You are incredibly beautiful.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.340
I will have to make you into a doll that befits such beauty.

20:38.060 --> 20:40.000
Where’s Elizabeth?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.050
Now then, what to make it out of?

20:43.490 --> 20:48.030
Clay flows too much, iron is too brash,

20:48.030 --> 20:50.810
therefore I think…

20:51.460 --> 20:57.060
Make it out of gold and silver, gold and silver, gold and silver.

20:57.060 --> 21:03.270
Make it out of gold and silver, my fair lady.

21:03.990 --> 21:09.170
Make it out of gold and silver, gold and silver, gold and silver.

21:09.170 --> 21:14.110
Make it out of gold and silver, my fair lady.

21:14.110 --> 21:19.160
Make it out of gold and silver, gold and silver, gold and silver.

21:19.160 --> 21:24.320
Make it out of gold and silver, my fair lady.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.970
Make it out of gold and silver…

21:38.600 --> 21:40.310
Let me out of here!

21:41.160 --> 21:46.950
From that day, my birthday, my life changed.

21:51.260 --> 21:56.350
I would never again have a happy birthday.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.540
Nonetheless…

22:02.670 --> 22:07.510
Nothing good ever seems to happen on your birthday, does it?

22:09.680 --> 22:13.180
You lose your mansion, your parents,

22:13.580 --> 22:17.360
and this time, will you lose Lady Elizabeth?

22:19.060 --> 22:20.350
Sebastian!

22:42.160 --> 22:45.040
Nothing I say comes out right.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.800
I can't love without a fight.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.550
No one ever knows my name.

22:50.550 --> 22:53.260
When I pray for sun, it rains.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.970
I'm so sick of wasting time,

22:55.970 --> 22:58.680
but nothing's moving in my mind.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.430
Inspiration can't be found.

23:01.430 --> 23:03.640
I get up and fall, but...

23:03.640 --> 23:06.440
I'm alive!

23:06.440 --> 23:08.770
I'm alive!

23:08.770 --> 23:09.690
Oh yeah!

23:09.690 --> 23:13.110
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:13.110 --> 23:14.610
reaching for Heaven!

23:14.610 --> 23:17.370
I will fight!

23:17.370 --> 23:19.620
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:19.620 --> 23:22.330
I live my life!

23:22.790 --> 23:25.540
I'm alive!

23:25.540 --> 23:27.880
I'm alive!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.120
Oh yeah!

23:29.120 --> 23:32.260
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:32.260 --> 23:33.800
reaching for Heaven!

23:33.800 --> 23:36.550
I will fight!

23:36.550 --> 23:38.760
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:38.760 --> 23:44.270
I live my hard life!

23:44.270 --> 23:50.770
I live my life! I'm alive!

23:57.940 --> 24:03.620
A heart manipulated by horrid memories, just like a puppet.

24:04.500 --> 24:09.260
Young Master, I have no interest in such a measly soul.

24:09.260 --> 24:13.590
Stand proud, look at the sky, and now, together:

24:15.090 --> 24:17.670
London Bridge is falling down!

24:18.620 --> 24:20.390
Next time on Kuroshitsuji:

24:20.390 --> 24:22.920
His Butler, Desolate.

24:20.410 --> 24:26.780
<font size="50"><font color="#ffffff">His Butler, Desolate</font></font>

24:20.410 --> 24:26.780
<font size="35"><font color="#ffffff">Preview</font></font>

24:22.920 --> 24:25.310
After all, I am one hell of a butler.

24:26.780 --> 24:29.840
<font size="22" face="Californian FB">We shall await you next time…</font>
