We're on the red carpet
tonight for the premiere
of Adrenaline Force.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.542
This is Bo Laramie's
breakout role

01:30.542 --> 01:31.959
in what is certain to become

01:31.959 --> 01:33.667
a very popular
action franchise.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.792
Take a look at the crowd
behind me.

01:35.792 --> 01:37.500
They have been
completely ignited

01:37.500 --> 01:39.667
by the anticipation
of Laramie's arrival.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.667
Oh, my God.
This is huge, babe.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.583
It's a long way from
pounding nails in buildings.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.000
Do you know
all these people?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.333
No, son.
I don't know any of 'em.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.834
I think they think
they know you, Dad.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.333
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.625
Okay, honey,
I want you to go out there

01:51.625 --> 01:52.750
and have a good time.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.000
Okay.
I'm proud of you.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.625
I love you.
You've worked hard.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.792
- Yeah. I'll see you guys
in a little bit.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.041
Buddy, give me five.
Huh?

02:00.041 --> 02:02.291
Go get 'em, Dad!

02:04.792 --> 02:06.959
Whoa.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.834
Good luck tonight, Bo.
Thanks.

02:08.834 --> 02:11.333
Bo. Your first action film.
How are you feeling tonight?

02:11.333 --> 02:13.458
Aw, man, this is
all new to me, you know.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.875
I'm just-- really just
trying to enjoy it. You know?

02:15.875 --> 02:17.959
And, uh, I'm excited.
This is-- It's unreal.

02:17.959 --> 02:19.458
Your fans are waiting.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.375
Unreal.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.375
Six months ago,
I couldn't get arrested

03:22.375 --> 03:24.959
with a fresh corpse
and a smoking gun.

03:24.959 --> 03:27.667

Bo Laramie.
Hold that thought.

Oh, my God!

Mom says you run
so you won't get fat.

Everything we have
fits in half a cabinet.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.417
I love this house.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.458
You sure it's ours?
It's ours, beautiful.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.959
It's ours.
How was your run?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.875
Good enough that the fat man
and his family

05:37.875 --> 05:39.792
can go get some muffins
on the way to soccer.

05:39.792 --> 05:42.542
Muffins!
Did you give
our secret away?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.625
Yeah.
Stop!

05:44.625 --> 05:46.458
Okay, I'm gonna put you
in the cabinet.

05:49.542 --> 05:52.458
Hey, Bo.
How are you, Sierra?
What's goin' on?

05:52.458 --> 05:54.500
Hi, Zach.
Hi, Sierra.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.625
Hi, Rusty.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.125
You know what? Give us
three of the blueberry

05:58.125 --> 06:00.417
and two coffees,
will you please?
Sure.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.917
I saw this huge billboard
of you going up on Sunset.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.750
Excuse me.
You're Bo Laramie, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.208
What's your name?

06:10.208 --> 06:13.125
Oh, I'm Emily, from Ohio.
Nice to meet you,
Emily from Ohio.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.667
Thanks. Could I get
your autograph?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.750
Yeah, absolutely.
Where would you
like me to sign?

06:17.750 --> 06:19.709
Right across your crotch
would be great.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.000
Hey, Zach,
let's go, buddy.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.917
Where'd you get this?

06:29.917 --> 06:31.709
They just put 'em out
at the grocery store.

06:31.709 --> 06:34.542
Thank you!
Yeah.

06:34.542 --> 06:37.208
Hold this,
will you, bud?

06:37.208 --> 06:39.875
- Just keep the change.
Thank you, Sierra.
- Thanks.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.792
See ya.
Bye, Sierra.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.542
- We're naked.
Can they do this?
- They did, Abby.

06:54.542 --> 06:58.291
How dare they put Zach
on the cover of a magazine?

06:58.291 --> 07:01.291
There are so many creeps
out there. I-- He's a minor.
Is this legal?

07:01.291 --> 07:03.792
I'm gonna call Gill,
and I'm gonna find out.
All right?

07:03.792 --> 07:06.250
God, Bo.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.542
My principal,
the teachers.

07:09.542 --> 07:12.000
My kids' parents.
What are they gonna think?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.917
I'm sorry you're being
put through this, Abby.

07:13.917 --> 07:16.000
Why is Daddy in a magazine

07:16.000 --> 07:19.083
with a black thing
covering his pee

07:19.083 --> 07:21.083
- You ready to play
some soccer today, buddy?
- Yeah!

07:26.792 --> 07:28.667
Here you go!

07:30.750 --> 07:32.750
How's it going, buddy?
Great.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.458
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.000
Hey, listen.
Thanks for those tickets.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.917
Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
You got it, bro.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.834
All right, now.
Only one thing matters, right?

07:40.834 --> 07:42.834
I know, Dad.
Have fun.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.750
Okay.

07:53.792 --> 07:55.917
I'll be right back, sweetie.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.959
Hey.
How you doin', Bo?

08:03.959 --> 08:06.208
All right.
What are you doin'?

08:06.208 --> 08:08.917
I'm about to watch
a soccer game.

08:08.917 --> 08:11.083
How's Zach
doin' this morning?
He's a good-lookin' boy.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.458
He's got a birthday comin' up,
doesn't he?

08:13.458 --> 08:15.000
You want to take
a picture of me?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.959
I'm right here, okay?
Take a few shots.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.834
'Cause you had no right
taking pictures of my son.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.834
That's a point of law,
Mr. Laramie.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.834
I have every right
to take pictures

08:22.834 --> 08:24.959
of whoever I want
in a public park.

08:24.959 --> 08:28.208
Yes, I do.
Not without my consent
you don't, all right?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.709
Now, come on.
Look. Things have changed.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.833
You're somebody now.
You better get used to this.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.207
Oh, yeah
Yes, you are.
You're somebody now.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.833
Now your game's
about to start.
It's a security risk.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.667
I'm asking you nicely,
and I'm saying please.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.582
Don't take pictures
of my son.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.083
Okay. Okay.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.125
You got it, Bo.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.542
I understand.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.375
Sure thing, famous guy.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.875
Good job, buddy.
You were awesome.

09:20.875 --> 09:24.333
- Thanks, Mom.
- I'm proud of you, son.
You did a great job, buddy.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.208
You did a great job.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.166
Son of a bitch.

09:29.166 --> 09:32.125
Take him to the car.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.792
Bo!

09:38.208 --> 09:41.917
What did I tell you?
I said don't take another
goddamn picture of my family.

09:41.917 --> 09:45.291
You understand that?
Not one more.
Yeah? Kid takes a nice picture.

09:45.291 --> 09:48.166
Won't bring half as much
as the ones I have of Abby
changing Zach's clothes.

09:48.166 --> 09:50.125
The steamy ones...
by the pool.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.792
Oh, yeah?

09:52.792 --> 09:54.959
Huh?
Is that Bo?

09:57.750 --> 10:00.959
Oh, are you gonna pay.

10:00.959 --> 10:03.000
Smile, Bo.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.333
You get that?

10:06.333 --> 10:09.875
Ooh,
in living color, chief.
Cops are on their way.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.250
- Bo!
- Hey, Bo.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.834
Hey, big shot!

10:14.834 --> 10:17.458
Enjoy what's left
of your weekend.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.542
Let's go make some money.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.500
Oh, yeah

10:27.500 --> 10:31.083
Wow. We're told
Laramie was released
late Saturday afternoon,

10:31.083 --> 10:33.417
ordered to attend
anger-management classes

10:33.417 --> 10:35.583
as part of a plea agreement.

10:35.583 --> 10:38.291
His people tell us
the assault charges
will likely be dropped

10:38.291 --> 10:40.875
in lieu of a settlement
that could easily cost

10:40.875 --> 10:43.333
the rising star
half a million dollars.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.000
The victim,
34-year-old Rex Harper,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.333
is also demanding
a public apology.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.333
Our very own Giuliana
caught up with Bo

10:50.333 --> 10:52.834
on the set of
his new action movie.

10:52.834 --> 10:55.041
Giuliana?
Thanks, Patrick.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.041
And thank you for agreeing
to sit down with me.
Thanks for having me.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.834
Bo, just so we understand
what happened,

10:59.834 --> 11:02.458
you became angry
at some photographers

11:02.458 --> 11:05.000
after they were
taking pictures of you
at a weekend soccer game?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.875
Mr. Harper was
taking pictures of my son.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.959
I politely asked him to stop,
and he didn't.

11:09.959 --> 11:13.542
So you hit him?

11:13.542 --> 11:18.041
Well, there's a little bit
more to it than that,
but, yeah.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.583
This guy is nothing
but a low-class parasite.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.250
Your parasite's right here.
He's never gonna get
an apology from me.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.500
And if he knows what's
good for him, he'll stay away
from me and my family.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.750
Can you believe this prick?
 Strong words.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.750
Yeah.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.625
Yeah. I gotta go.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.500
Laramie, I'm gonna
destroy your life
and eat your soul,

11:39.500 --> 11:41.834
and I can't wait
to do it.

11:58.834 --> 12:02.125
Well, here's one for ya.
You're lucky.

12:02.125 --> 12:05.000
Real lucky.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.125
A judge orders me to spend
$400 an hour on therapy

12:07.125 --> 12:09.125
that I don't need,
and that makes me lucky?

12:09.125 --> 12:12.792
You're lucky
you're not in jail.

12:12.792 --> 12:15.417
You're not
in Montana anymore, Bo.

12:15.417 --> 12:18.625
Anger management
is not about upgrading
from a 20 to a 12-gauge.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.333
The point is,

12:21.333 --> 12:23.917
you're carrying belief systems
from a previous life

12:23.917 --> 12:26.333
that don't fit
your new reality.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.000
Some of your old values
may not be valuable anymore.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.834
Not here, not now.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.333
Well, I disagree.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.291
You don't mess
with a man's family.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.333
And I'm not gonna change
who I am

12:38.333 --> 12:42.000
to suit my environment
or your expectations.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.166
I got to where I am
by doing things my own way.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.333
Oh, I think the judge
would agree with you.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.208
That's not what I meant, but--

12:48.208 --> 12:50.959
No, I know that.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.875
Look, your, uh--
your time here--

12:53.875 --> 12:55.875
it's gonna give you
the tools to better deal

12:55.875 --> 12:58.250
with situations
like last Saturday's.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.917
And I'm considerably cheaper
than Mr. Harper.

13:01.917 --> 13:06.250
All right. Is that it?
For now, yes.

13:06.250 --> 13:10.208
And, uh, if you have a problem,
I want you to call me.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.041
All right.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.834
Thank you.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.208
I'll see you next week.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.000
Thanks, Phil.

13:26.291 --> 13:28.375
Clear.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.208
Must be cold as hell
this time of year.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.041
Huh?
Switzerland.

13:35.041 --> 13:37.083
What do you mean?
It says here--

13:37.083 --> 13:38.583
This came out of the U.K.,
so it must be true--

13:38.583 --> 13:40.417
"Unnamed sources say

13:40.417 --> 13:42.709
"Laramie chartered
a private jet to Switzerland.

13:42.709 --> 13:45.041
"While there the young star
reportedly underwent
a penile enhancement,

13:45.041 --> 13:47.125
surprising his wife with it
on her birthday."

13:47.125 --> 13:49.500
Nice, huh?
You give it a name?
"Big Bo"

13:49.500 --> 13:51.667
Something sexy for the bedroom,
to keep it fun.
I'm going to.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.417
Bo, can we get you
for a lineup in here?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no problem.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.166
It's nice,
how they caught me.
Yeah.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.709
Y

13:57.709 --> 13:59.625
Can't keep anything
a secret these days.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.417
You got the work done,
you might as well
let people see it.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.542
If it's big like that,
w-why would you want
to hide it?

14:03.542 --> 14:07.000
Be nicer to him.
Things have changed
around here. Take a look.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.208
Oye.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.375
Amigos.
You got the stuff, huh?

14:16.375 --> 14:18.583
Sí.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.667
Thank you.
Muchas gracias, amigos. Merci.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.750
Sure, man.

14:25.125 --> 14:28.000
Pinche americano, está loco.
Este buey está zafado.

14:57.083 --> 15:00.041
♪♪

15:20.000 --> 15:22.625
Nice legs.
What time do they open?

15:22.625 --> 15:24.959
Does that usually work
where you come from?

15:24.959 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, a couple of times.
Leave!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.667
Now!

15:32.417 --> 15:35.166
Can you believe that guy?
I thought he was kind of cute.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.250
Loser.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.583
And you're considering this?

15:38.583 --> 15:41.542
All I'm saying
is they called.

15:41.542 --> 15:45.458
Those schmucks over at Web Pics
are turning this friggin'
business into a trout farm.

15:45.458 --> 15:49.583
Celebrities getting approval
over paparazzi's photos?
That's bullshit!

15:49.583 --> 15:54.125
The public wants raw and real,
and that's what we give them.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.166
Let me tell you something,
my friends.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.166
We're the last
of the real hunters.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.667
I'll drink to that.

16:00.667 --> 16:04.583
Like those shots
you got of Lopez.
Now, they were the shit.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.208
And you are a dog.
Damn straight.
I made bank on 'em too.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.291
I spent three nights
hidin' in that tree.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.583
Ants crawlin'
all over my ass.

16:11.583 --> 16:15.709
I picked her off
with a thousand mil
from 120 yards out.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.542
It was beautiful.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.875
Yeah. Too bad
it wasn't really Lopez.

16:21.875 --> 16:25.041
Nobody knows that.
Let me tell you
something, Kevin.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.667
Don't start sweatin'
the small stuff, okay?

16:27.667 --> 16:30.041
Or you'll get soft, end up

16:30.041 --> 16:31.875
like the rest of those pussies
working at the agencies.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.166
Hey, I'm here, ain't I?
Hanging with you and Rex,

16:34.166 --> 16:36.500
who is, by the way,
still the king.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.709
Hundred and five
thousand dollars

16:38.709 --> 16:40.709
for that shot
of Clooney in the woods.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.875
Ohh-hoo.

16:42.875 --> 16:45.625
Yeah, Clooney's been
a real gold mine.

16:45.625 --> 16:48.333
- She's a lesbian.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.250
Really?

16:50.250 --> 16:53.041
I'm gonna get
a second opinion.

16:53.041 --> 16:55.000
God, you get
a lot of lesbians.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.333
Let's go.
Excuse me.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.333
Buy you another round?
Yeah.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.458
Hey, Dan-- Dana.

17:01.458 --> 17:04.125
I guess
you can afford it.
What's that supposed to mean?

17:04.125 --> 17:05.834
You think I wouldn't
recognize the guy

17:05.834 --> 17:08.083
that siphoned
half a million dollars
out of Bo Laramie?

17:08.083 --> 17:12.083
Hey, I saw you
get your ass kicked on TV.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.709
Look,
I'm a photojournalist.

17:14.709 --> 17:16.750
I was doing my job.
Mm-hmm.

17:16.750 --> 17:20.416
I was assaulted
and justice was served.

17:20.416 --> 17:22.750
With the exception
of Laramie's apology to me.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.750
I like reading the tabloids.
I think they're fun.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.500
I think you're drunk.
I think you're cute.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.583
Your pictures
hurt people.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.041
Do they?
The irony--

17:35.041 --> 17:37.583
Marcy.
Marcy,

17:37.583 --> 17:39.625
is everyone
wants to have steak,

17:39.625 --> 17:42.542
but nobody wants to date
the butcher.

17:42.542 --> 17:48.250
My job is to provide a window
of reality for society.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.417
It's up to them
whether they want
to look through it or not.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.333
Come on. Have you ever
bought a tabloid?

17:54.333 --> 17:58.375
Guilty as charged.
Don't feel guilty.
Guilty's bad.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.291
I mean, everyone wants
to have a--

18:00.291 --> 18:03.750
little peek, huh?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.875
See? It's human nature.

18:06.875 --> 18:10.792
Look, there's a--
There's a premiere tonight

18:10.792 --> 18:13.458
and an after party
I'm covering.

18:13.458 --> 18:16.041
Come with me, as my guest,

18:16.041 --> 18:19.208
and, um, see things
from an entirely
different perspective--

18:19.208 --> 18:21.417
mine.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.750
Hey, do a shot with me
and then tell me your story.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.750
I'm a good listener.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.291
Really?
Uh-huh.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.208
Listen to this--
No.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.500
What do you say, Marcy?
You want to have
a little adventure?

18:38.250 --> 18:41.917
♪♪

18:41.917 --> 18:44.959
It's beautiful.
You should come and see it.
Yeah?

18:44.959 --> 18:47.792
So, when--
Saturday, can you come? Or--

18:47.792 --> 18:50.583
Saturday would be great.
Hey, Bo. How's it going, mate?

18:50.583 --> 18:52.959
- Good to see you again.
Remember me?
- Good to see you.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.542
London press junket.
You were sitting next to me
in the pub.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.625
There was
that beautiful bird
on your lap and--

18:58.625 --> 19:00.792
- Oh, sorry, man.
Is that your wife?
- Get out of here.

19:00.792 --> 19:03.333
Sorry.
Get out of here.

19:03.333 --> 19:06.750
What the hell was that?
Some jackass.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.291
Hey. She bite?

19:13.291 --> 19:15.000
There's no way the little
missus ignores that.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.333
Great. Let's roll.
Come on. Let's go!

19:18.333 --> 19:20.959
Road trip.
Wait! Aren't we going in?

19:32.417 --> 19:34.917
You want to tell me
what's bothering you, honey?

19:34.917 --> 19:37.792
I just think it's interesting.
That's all.

19:37.792 --> 19:40.750
You were in London
last spring.
Right.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.875
My girlfriends at home
get jealous

19:42.875 --> 19:44.500
if somebody winks
at their husband

19:44.500 --> 19:46.417
at the company
Christmas party.

19:46.417 --> 19:50.667
Half the civilized world
wants my husband.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.792
How do you think
that makes me feel?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.375
You know what
that guy said tonight
is bullshit, right?

19:55.375 --> 19:58.875
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.542
I guess it's all
just new to me, you know?

20:01.542 --> 20:03.917
It's new to me too, honey.
And I'm--

20:03.917 --> 20:05.834
You know, every day
I'm learning.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.083
Abby!

20:12.083 --> 20:15.583
- Bo! Look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

20:15.583 --> 20:18.041
- Look at me!
- Hey, Bo! Big shot!

20:18.041 --> 20:20.166
- Look at me!
- I can't see a thing.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.709
Bo! Bo!

20:21.709 --> 20:23.834
Bo, slow down!

20:25.792 --> 20:27.583
- Daddy!
- It's all right, son.
It's okay.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.792
Son of a bitch!

20:29.792 --> 20:31.959
Takin' the front!

20:31.959 --> 20:33.709
Okay, Leonard. Box him in.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.458
- Hold on!

21:37.458 --> 21:40.083
Len! Come on. Let's go.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.792
Come on. Come on.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.834
Hello, sweetie.

21:51.834 --> 21:54.959
Yeah, there's been
a terrible accident
on, uh, 5th and Flower.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.792
We need an ambulance.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.333
Oh, yeah.

22:27.542 --> 22:30.083
Hey, Marcy.
Hey, honey.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.959
Everything's gonna
be fine, okay? Come on.

22:32.959 --> 22:35.750
Everything's fine.
There's an ambulance
on the way already.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.583
They're not hurt that bad.
We'll go back on my boat,
have a drink.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.125
Okay?
I'll be right back.
All right.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.000
Okay
Okay.

22:46.917 --> 22:49.792
Let's go. Clear out.
We're finished here.

22:49.792 --> 22:51.792
Go! Go! Go!
Come on!

22:51.792 --> 22:53.667
Go!

23:39.000 --> 23:40.875
Hi.

23:42.125 --> 23:45.000
How is she?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.583
She's in recovery.
I had to remove her spleen.

23:52.375 --> 23:56.375
The next few weeks
will be very difficult, Bo.
She'll be in a lot of pain.

23:56.375 --> 24:00.083
We'll manage that
with medication,
watch her very carefully.

24:01.959 --> 24:04.917
Now, let's talk about
your little guy here.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.834
He's stable.
His vitals are good.

24:07.834 --> 24:11.083
But comas are
a tricky thing, Bo.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.792
All we can do is wait.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.667
Okay.

24:18.125 --> 24:22.041
- Absolutely.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.542
Thank you, Doctor.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.875
Daddy!

25:34.667 --> 25:37.542
- Mm-hmm.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.667
The wine--
You mu-- You must have
put something in it--

25:39.667 --> 25:41.625
Obviously it made you
quite amorous.

25:41.625 --> 25:45.166
It's a shame, Marcy,
you don't remember it.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.834
Still going to the police
to tell them

25:46.834 --> 25:49.166
who caused Laramie's
accident? Think again!

25:49.166 --> 25:51.083
Not only will I attach that

25:51.083 --> 25:52.375
to every porno site
on the Internet,

25:52.375 --> 25:54.583
I will make sure it finds
its way

25:54.583 --> 25:56.417
to your father's desk
at the State Department.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.875
You wouldn't--
You wouldn't do that.

26:03.875 --> 26:07.500
You don't see my face
on that screen.
Do you, Marcy?

26:07.500 --> 26:10.250
Now go-- go to the police!
See if I'm bluffing!

26:10.250 --> 26:11.709
Get out of my goddamn house!

26:11.709 --> 26:13.583
Get out of here.

26:22.709 --> 26:24.917
Hey there, little guy.

26:26.834 --> 26:29.917
I'm gonna come back
and see you every day, okay?

26:35.458 --> 26:38.250
It's okay, honey.
He can hear you, sweetie.
All right?

26:38.250 --> 26:40.125
Okay.

26:43.291 --> 26:44.959
One second, honey.

26:44.959 --> 26:46.667
I'm gonna go out
and talk to the detective.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.250
I'll be right back.

26:48.250 --> 26:50.750
Honey, wake up and you can
have whatever you want.

26:52.667 --> 26:54.959
Hi, Bo.
How are you, Detective?

26:54.959 --> 26:57.083
I tracked down those paparazzi
guys you told me about.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.458
Brought 'em in one at a time.

26:59.458 --> 27:02.208
They all came up
with the same story.
Oh, yeah

27:02.208 --> 27:04.917
Well, they never deny
following you.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.917
They say they drove up
on the accident,

27:06.917 --> 27:09.417
called 911 and never left
until help arrived.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.917
Detective, that's bullshit.
You hear me?

27:11.917 --> 27:14.542
Come on, man.
Give me a break, will ya?

27:14.542 --> 27:17.542
I'm just tellin' you
what I got.

27:17.542 --> 27:20.959
Until I find someone
who saw somethin' different,
that's all I have.

27:20.959 --> 27:23.208
What about
the, uh, other driver?

27:24.750 --> 27:26.667
He died late last night.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.625
He never
regained consciousness.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.959
I'm sorry, Bo. But listen,

27:32.959 --> 27:35.375
if there's a witness out there,
I'm gonna find him.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.792
Believe me.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.542
I'm all over this one, Bo.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.667
I appreciate it.

27:49.792 --> 27:51.709
The victim died, Bo.

27:51.709 --> 27:53.792
What now?

27:58.458 --> 28:00.792
Did you mean
to kill him, Bo?
Nice driving.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.750
Stellar Agency.
Please hold.
That's for pickup, Sara.

28:09.750 --> 28:12.208
Bo, taking
these paparazzi to court

28:12.208 --> 28:14.333
is only gonna cause
more headlines.

28:14.333 --> 28:17.291
Let it go. We've got bigger
problems to deal with.

28:17.291 --> 28:19.458
The studio says
we get back to work

28:19.458 --> 28:21.792
or they will be forced
to shut down the picture.

28:21.792 --> 28:24.792
Five weeks, Bo. They're losing
a tremendous amount of money.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.208
The bond company
is now threatening

28:26.208 --> 28:28.166
to go after you.
And your production company.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.709
Technically,
you weren't hurt.

28:32.250 --> 28:35.583
- Uh, Bo, you're upset.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.625
You don't know shit.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.333
I'm sorry.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.250
So, what do you want us
to do, Bo?

29:26.208 --> 29:28.250
And that's a cut.
Excellent!

29:28.250 --> 29:30.959
Well done.

29:30.959 --> 29:33.917
Whoo. Way to do it.
Way to do it.

29:33.917 --> 29:35.583
You all right?
Yeah.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.625
All right.
That's a wrap, everybody.

29:37.625 --> 29:39.792
We'll pick it up here
tomorrow morning.

29:39.792 --> 29:42.041
What you got, Jay?

29:42.041 --> 29:43.792
Just a bunch of crap.

29:46.125 --> 29:49.083
Oh, man.
"Laramie's wife on drugs."

29:50.375 --> 29:52.458
"Star too busy to notice."

29:52.458 --> 29:55.500
Mr. Laramie?
I'm Reggie, Aegis Security.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.583
Hey, Reggie.
The studio sent me
to keep an eye on things.

29:58.583 --> 30:01.375
I'll be on set
for the rest of the show.

30:03.125 --> 30:04.917
Well, I could use you.

30:16.542 --> 30:19.375
Hey, Bo. No soccer

Hey.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.041
- Oh, my God.
- No, that's okay.

Oh, no, no, no.
I'm so sorry.
Sierra.

30:26.208 --> 30:30.125
I can't believe
I just said that.
Sierra, look at me. Sierra?

30:30.125 --> 30:32.208
Zach will be fine, okay?

30:32.208 --> 30:34.041
Okay.
All right?

30:39.834 --> 30:42.208
Goddamn it.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.458
Hey!

30:45.458 --> 30:47.083
Hey!

30:51.208 --> 30:53.250
What are you gonna do,
hit me too?

[ Engine Starting,

31:29.625 --> 31:32.417
Yeah. That's bullshit, man!

31:53.625 --> 31:57.667
Yeah, Beverly Hills.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.875
Let me have the number for
a Dr. Jennifer Kelley, please.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.166
- Whoa!

32:18.875 --> 32:20.667
Hey!

32:20.667 --> 32:23.583
Help me!
I'm comin', man.
Hold on!

32:23.583 --> 32:26.041
You got to help me.
Please!

I'm here.

Help me. Reach.
Reach! Reach! Reach!

Give me your hand.
Hurry up.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.750
Give me your hand.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.125
What are you trying to do,
kill me?

32:48.125 --> 32:50.458
Shut up and give me
your goddamn hand!
Damn! Oh, my God!

32:52.959 --> 32:55.959

Oh, God! You-- You think
we were up your ass before?

33:04.792 --> 33:06.166
I'm gonna own you now, slick.

33:06.166 --> 33:09.583
What'd you say?
Just pull me up!

33:09.583 --> 33:10.917
Pull me up.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.166
Come on. Pull me up. Hurry!

33:15.166 --> 33:19.792
Pull me up! Now! Now!

34:10.000 --> 34:13.166
I'm startin' to feel
much more in control
of my anger.

34:13.166 --> 34:16.125
Well, that's quite
a leap in progress.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.333
Especially considering
your recent tragedy.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.417
Yeah.

34:20.417 --> 34:22.000
Well, I can't let the fact

34:22.000 --> 34:24.125
that four paparazzis
nearly killed my family

34:24.125 --> 34:26.083
affect my behavior,
now, can I?

34:26.083 --> 34:28.208
What do you mean
by that, Bo?

34:28.208 --> 34:32.208
Well, you asked me
to work on something,
and, uh, I did.

34:32.208 --> 34:35.166
Well, surely you must
have some feelings
about what happened.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.417
I feel cheated.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.917
I'm angry.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.458
Blessed.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.333
All at the same time.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.667
What's this?

34:52.667 --> 34:54.958
A journal.

34:54.958 --> 34:58.834
I want you to start
recording specific events
that prompt your anger

34:58.834 --> 35:01.083
and how you dealt with them
in the moment.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.709
Doing this will help you
put a face on your problems.

35:03.709 --> 35:07.125
My problems already
have faces, Dr. Kelley.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.208
Well, then you're moving
in the right direction.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.375
Let this journal become
a sanctuary for you, Bo.

35:14.375 --> 35:16.458
My clients are having
great success with it.

35:17.709 --> 35:18.834
Really?

35:41.375 --> 35:43.333
This shit happens
way too often.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.875
This kid never even
hit the brakes.

35:45.875 --> 35:49.291
This guy ain't no kid.
He's close to 40.
They call 'em Rolex riders.

35:49.291 --> 35:52.250
They hang out
in Beverly Hills,
wear expensive leathers.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.500

all their hair.
Pity. He was cute.

You boys mind
if I sniff around?
Knock yourself out, Detective.

Hey, why's
Special Investigations

36:02.917 --> 36:05.542
sending a D-2 down
to a traffic accident?

36:05.542 --> 36:07.917
Well, I heard
your victim's name
on the radio.

36:07.917 --> 36:10.625
He was part of a case
that I've been working on.

36:10.625 --> 36:12.792
It's probably nothing.
I just thought
I'd look around.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.250
Here you go, sweetie.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.250
Thank you.
Sure.

Mm-mmm.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.166
Okay.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.166
One second.
All right?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Hello.
Oh, hi, Bo.
It's Detective Burton.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.208
Hey, Detective.
I hope I'm not
bothering you.

36:58.208 --> 37:00.917
No, no, no.
We just got back
from the hospital.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.166
Any change?
No, no.
No change.

37:03.166 --> 37:06.709
But thanks for asking.
So, what's up?

37:06.709 --> 37:09.542
Well,
you remember that guy
Kevin Rosner?

37:09.542 --> 37:11.667
He was killed earlier today
in a motorcycle accident.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.750
The-- The name
sounds familiar. Wh--

37:15.750 --> 37:17.834
He was one of
the photographers

37:17.834 --> 37:19.250
that was involved
in your accident.

37:19.250 --> 37:20.959
Oh.

37:20.959 --> 37:23.166
Well, that's
too bad, isn't it?

37:23.166 --> 37:25.166
I just thought
you'd like to know.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.458
Yeah, well,
I appreciate you calling.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.083
Okay.

Hey, baby.

Hey. What do you got?

38:49.333 --> 38:51.875
Just like I expected.
Cops refused to release
Kevin's personal effects.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.959
- Then what are we doin'--
I said I expected it.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.750
So I slapped 'em with
a bogus power of attorney.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.375
They didn't have any choice.

Do you mind, love?

Check this out.

39:11.792 --> 39:14.417

39:14.417 --> 39:16.959
Even in death,
they can't shut him up.

39:16.959 --> 39:20.291
Hey, Cheryl. Call Richard.
Tell him to hold the cover.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.250
Hello, Debra.
Can you get me through
to Richard?

39:27.250 --> 39:29.917
We got something here.
We need to
speak with him now.

39:34.417 --> 39:36.500
Bo?

39:36.500 --> 39:38.583
Bo! Howdy.
Hey, Detective.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.208
How are you?
Good. How you doin'?

39:40.208 --> 39:41.542
Okay. Good to see you.
Everything all right?

39:41.542 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, things are good.

You want a cup of coffee?

39:44.041 --> 39:46.166
I'd love one. Thanks.

39:46.166 --> 39:49.417
- Let's take a walk.
I'll show you around.
- Okay.

39:49.417 --> 39:53.166
Listen, the other day
after I hung up with you
I did some digging around.

39:53.166 --> 39:56.458
We're dealing with
real scumbags here, Bo.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.166
This guy--
Leonard Clark?

39:58.166 --> 40:00.917
He used to be an attorney.

40:00.917 --> 40:05.000
He got himself disbarred
for distribution of narcotics.
Is that right?

40:05.000 --> 40:08.041
What do you think
the son of a bitch does?

40:08.041 --> 40:09.291
He turns around
and sues the police department

40:09.291 --> 40:11.041
for illegal search and seizure.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.959
Cost the city a million bucks
just to make it go away.

40:13.959 --> 40:18.291
He's still on probation for
possession of illegal firearms.
Really.

40:18.291 --> 40:22.583
And this other guy
The guy you slapped around?

40:22.583 --> 40:25.083
He slimed his way out of
an attempted rape charge.

40:25.083 --> 40:27.083
Guess who
the attorney was.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.125
Leonard Clark?
Yeah.

40:29.125 --> 40:32.041
And by the way,
you're not the first
deep pockets he got into.

40:32.041 --> 40:34.750
This actor,
Andy Baldwin?
Alec?

40:34.750 --> 40:36.792
Yeah. One of
those Baldwin guys.

40:36.792 --> 40:38.750
Anyway,
he slaps Harper around.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.834
Harper takes him
to the cleaners,

40:40.834 --> 40:43.417
and then Harper moves into
a boat in the marina.

40:44.542 --> 40:46.625
Now, listen, Bo,

40:46.625 --> 40:49.792
until I get this thing
straightened out--

40:49.792 --> 40:53.500
I know that you actors
have people and places
you wanna keep confidential.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.667
Right.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.166
If I were you,
I would be very careful

40:57.166 --> 40:59.542
about what
I said on my cell phone.

40:59.542 --> 41:02.333
Really. Why's that?
Because for a couple
hundred dollars,

41:02.333 --> 41:05.208
you can go to
your local radio guy

41:05.208 --> 41:07.709
and you can drop in
on anybody at any time.

41:07.709 --> 41:10.750
Bo, we're ready
for you on set.
Okay.

41:10.750 --> 41:13.750
Listen, Detective,
thanks for coming by.
I appreciate it.

41:13.750 --> 41:15.959
I'll speak to you soon.
Okay? Thank you.
Okay.

41:15.959 --> 41:18.041
Thank you.

41:27.667 --> 41:30.208
I'm scared for Zach.
I--

41:30.208 --> 41:32.583
Part of me just wants
to take him back to Montana

41:32.583 --> 41:34.709
where he can feel secure.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.834
I don't think
he's gonna get that here.

- Yeah, I just got here.

See you in a sec.

you piece of shit?

Sorry, man.
Can't let you slide.

Yes, I do.

- Uninvited guest.

Oh, yeah? I don't see
anybody hurt or naked.

in the right place, Leonard?

44:31.208 --> 44:33.500
Very funny.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.500
Get rid of him, Reg.

44:38.500 --> 44:41.166
You heard him.

in what police are describing

47:36.500 --> 47:37.959
The victim, Leonard Clark,

at several officers

to open fire,

in your accident.

I don't know, it just takes
a certain kind of person

51:19.792 --> 51:22.333

something like this.

51:41.250 --> 51:43.333

one of my family.

51:47.500 --> 51:50.542
I'm running up against it
on this one, Bo.

51:50.542 --> 51:52.375

51:54.709 --> 51:56.667

with a random accident

51:56.667 --> 51:58.500

That's what I think.

Well, as it turns out,

52:03.208 --> 52:05.500

might not be that random.
