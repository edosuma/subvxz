CHRISTMAS-IS-OVER-SALE!

01:09.636 --> 01:12.562
PLEASE REPORT ALL SANTAS TO SECURITY

01:12.970 --> 01:16.141
<i># Oh, Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree, #</i>

01:16.176 --> 01:19.064
<i># You're on the curb and dead now #</i>

01:19.099 --> 01:25.400
<i># Your Christmas lights are in the box.
In two months we will change the clocks #</i>

01:25.435 --> 01:26.984
<i># Oh, Christmas tree, oh... #</i>

01:29.147 --> 01:32.967
Gee, they sure give the Christmas spirit
the bum's rush around here.

01:33.002 --> 01:35.925
And they've already started
exploiting the next holiday.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.802
MEET MARTIN LUTHER KING

01:38.281 --> 01:40.627
So, young man, have you judged people

01:40.662 --> 01:43.266
by the content of their character this year?

01:43.301 --> 01:44.600
Yes, Reverend Doctor.

01:44.635 --> 01:48.313
- Lunchtime!
- Free at last! Free at last!

01:48.556 --> 01:50.388
Okay, remember our deal--

01:50.423 --> 01:54.442
everyone gets to return one Christmas present
with no hurt feelings.

01:54.477 --> 01:56.446
I'm returning this kitten calendar.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.699
Um, I'm also returning this kitten calendar.

01:59.734 --> 02:00.909
Kitten calendar.

02:01.888 --> 02:06.430
Hey, those are 15 month calendars!
That gives you three extra kittens!

02:08.239 --> 02:12.114
That's the last time I get you guys
a Christmas present at the last minute.

02:12.149 --> 02:13.873
Man, those are ugly kittens!

02:13.908 --> 02:17.649
Mom, Dad! Our mall got a Mapple store!

02:17.684 --> 02:19.580
It's so sterile!

02:19.615 --> 02:22.082
MyPods! MyPhones!

02:22.117 --> 02:24.018
A Brainiac Bar!

02:24.053 --> 02:26.224
My question is the
following statement:

02:26.259 --> 02:28.271
Operating System 4.2

02:28.306 --> 02:31.047
has sloppier architecture
than a Tijuana anthill.

02:31.082 --> 02:34.082
Did you get peanut butter
in your Ethernet port again?

02:34.117 --> 02:37.195
No. I got mayonnaise in the CD drive.

02:38.855 --> 02:41.227
Hmm! I see you're
admiring our MyCube.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.137
It's fueled by dreams and
powered by imagination.

02:44.172 --> 02:45.876
- What does it do?
- You should ask yourself,

02:45.911 --> 02:47.625
"What can I do for it?"

02:47.660 --> 02:50.800
Okay. What can I do for you?
Please, I'm begging you!

02:50.835 --> 02:52.524
Sir, it's not even turned on yet.

02:52.559 --> 02:55.129
- But it's glowing.
- That light confirms that it's off.

02:57.257 --> 02:59.278
I can't afford
any of your products

02:59.313 --> 03:01.691
but can I buy some
fake white earbuds,

03:01.726 --> 03:03.608
so people will think
I have a MyPod?

03:03.643 --> 03:06.140
Sure, those are
called "MyPhonies."

03:06.900 --> 03:09.197
Oh, and they cost $40.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.252
Oh, I'll never get
a Mapple anything.

03:12.287 --> 03:14.548
I hate this MyPod!

03:14.583 --> 03:16.922
I can't watch movies
on a screen this small.

03:16.957 --> 03:21.954
And the music today--
don't get me started!

03:21.989 --> 03:26.870
I said, don't get me started!

03:28.679 --> 03:31.921
Come on, isn't someone
going to get me started?!

03:33.476 --> 03:37.907
Uh, let's go, Teeny.
Maybe somebody at Old Navy
will get me started.

03:37.942 --> 03:40.533
- Here kid, you take it.
- Thank you, Krusty!

03:40.568 --> 03:42.260
Oh, don't thank me.

03:42.295 --> 03:45.471
Thank the Jewish Clown
Awards gift basket.

03:45.910 --> 03:48.028
I'm a Mapple person!

03:48.063 --> 03:50.619
- We're all Mapple people.
- Sorry.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.730
Attention, Mapple universe!

03:53.765 --> 03:55.780
Prepare for a live announcement

03:55.815 --> 04:00.069
from Mapple founder and Chief
Imaginative Officer Steve Mobbs.

04:00.104 --> 04:01.557
Steve Mobbs?!
He's here?!

04:01.592 --> 04:02.592
He's a genius!

04:02.627 --> 04:05.033
He's like a god who
knows what we want!

04:05.068 --> 04:09.486
Greetings, it is I, your insanely
great leader, Steve Mobbs.

04:09.521 --> 04:11.812
I'm speaking to you from Mapple headquarters

04:11.847 --> 04:13.918
deep below the sea, with an announcement

04:13.953 --> 04:16.711
that will completely change the
way you look at everything!

04:18.065 --> 04:19.942
And that announcement is....

04:19.978 --> 04:21.752
You're all losers!

04:23.311 --> 04:25.634
You think you're cool because
you buy a $500 phone with a

04:25.669 --> 04:27.732
picture of a fruit on it?!
Well, guess what?

04:27.767 --> 04:30.892
They cost eight bucks to make
and I pee on every one!

04:31.955 --> 04:34.425
I have made a fortune
off you chumps

04:34.460 --> 04:36.756
and I've invested it all in Microsoft!

04:36.791 --> 04:38.622
Now my boyfriend,
Bill Gates, and I

04:38.657 --> 04:40.789
kiss each other on a
pile of your money!

04:44.340 --> 04:47.492
Traitor! Your heart is
blacker than your turtleneck!

04:55.989 --> 04:59.057
Who dares question the boss
we fired 10 years ago

04:59.092 --> 05:01.994
and then brought back?
- It was my brother Bart!

05:02.029 --> 05:04.592
Flay him with your earbuds!
Flay him, I say!

05:07.371 --> 05:09.223
MyCube, take me away!

05:15.471 --> 05:17.021
Get him!

05:17.638 --> 05:18.898
Get him! Go!

05:19.776 --> 05:21.138
Stupid angry mob,

05:21.173 --> 05:24.485
chasing me
because I shine a harsh light
on modern society.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.569
Now I know how
Dane Cook feels.

05:28.511 --> 05:30.378
Mmm, what's that exotic aroma?

05:30.413 --> 05:33.413
It smells like a hamburger
cooked at a rug store.

05:37.761 --> 05:41.379
Hello. Would you like some lamb?

05:43.876 --> 05:45.639
Whoa! All these years
I've been petting lambs

05:45.674 --> 05:47.828
when I should've been
shoving them in my mouth!

05:47.863 --> 05:49.394
- I'm Bart.
- I'm Bashir.

05:49.429 --> 05:51.818
My family and I just
moved here, from Jordan.

05:51.853 --> 05:54.514
Jordan. That's on some
map somewhere, right?

05:54.549 --> 05:57.437
Bashir, introduce me
to your new friend.

05:57.472 --> 06:00.481
Bashir, you didn't tell me
you had a sister.

06:01.510 --> 06:04.802
Such a charmer.
Would you like to stay for dinner?

06:04.837 --> 06:07.404
Hey, I never refuse food
from strangers.

06:08.691 --> 06:12.962
Okay, you're new to our school,
so here's the deal:
we call Skinner, "Skin-rash,"

06:12.997 --> 06:15.379
Mr. Wiener is "Mr. Whiner,"

06:15.414 --> 06:18.371
and Groundskeeper Willie,
"Grounds-Creeper Stupid."

06:18.865 --> 06:22.392
Ah, that's not clever! And I have
so many aspects you can mock!

06:22.427 --> 06:24.085
I'm poor, I'm dirty,

06:24.120 --> 06:26.743
I can't read or write,
I think movies are real!

06:28.838 --> 06:32.220
Okay, next, here's the food at
the cafeteria that will make you sick:

06:32.255 --> 06:34.788
coleslaw, tuna,
all chowders and gumbos.

06:34.823 --> 06:36.962
The only thing that's
safe is the pork chops.

06:36.997 --> 06:40.006
My religion says
I can never eat pork.

06:40.041 --> 06:43.163
A different religion?!
Do not tell anyone that

06:43.198 --> 06:45.540
because if the bullies around here
find out that you're different...

06:45.575 --> 06:47.153
Who's different?

06:49.219 --> 06:51.521
What's your name,
sweat stain?

06:52.372 --> 06:54.448
- Uh, Bashir.
- "Bash here"?

06:54.483 --> 06:57.288
I love a kid that
comes with directions.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.403
Okay, Bashir.

07:02.438 --> 07:05.997
Tell us where you came from
so we can punch you back there.

07:06.032 --> 07:10.062
I'm going to punch you extra hard
'cause I secretly think you're cute.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.131
You can't just whale on him because he's--

07:13.166 --> 07:14.940
What religion are you anyway?

07:14.975 --> 07:16.507
- Muslim.
- Oh, boy.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.259
You're the reason I can't carry
toothpaste on an airplane!

07:22.327 --> 07:24.000
Look, guys,
everyone's different.

07:24.035 --> 07:26.234
Jimbo, you're Christian,
Dolph, you're Jewish,

07:26.269 --> 07:28.672
and, Kearney, your family's
in that cult Moe started.

07:28.707 --> 07:31.315
I had to join.
My mom's doing the savior.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.984
- I mean, the one true Moe.
- You're the one true mo.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.357
Help me, almighty Moe!

07:44.392 --> 07:46.252
Can't. I'm not really a god.

07:46.287 --> 07:48.881
I was just acting crazy
to get out of jury duty.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.261
Look at Lisa Simpson,
over there by herself.

07:55.296 --> 07:58.324
Not talking to us,
her best friends!

07:58.359 --> 08:00.601
Do we hate her? YES!

08:00.636 --> 08:03.589
Lisa, we came to
tell you that we...

08:03.624 --> 08:05.591
Is that a MyPod?

08:05.626 --> 08:09.281
Yeah. I've already downloaded
so much incredible music!

08:09.316 --> 08:14.465
Check out "Moon Dreams"
from Miles Davis' "Birth of the cool".

08:22.090 --> 08:26.919
Or, check out this MyTunes exclusive
episode of Itchy & Scratchy.

08:30.356 --> 08:32.299

09:03.789 --> 09:05.833

THE '70s...
STUDIO 54

09:42.547 --> 09:45.148
Marge, I installed
all the low-energy bulbs.

09:45.183 --> 09:47.055
What have you done
with the old ones?

09:47.090 --> 09:49.961
Disposed of them in an
environmentally friendly manner.

09:53.437 --> 09:55.790
- Salaam alaikum!
- Salaam alaikum!

09:55.825 --> 09:57.786
Milhouse is looking good!

09:57.821 --> 10:01.132
He's got contacts, changed color,
got a cool new catchphrase.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.685
Salaam alaikum!

10:03.720 --> 10:06.894
Dad, that's Bashir,
my new friend.

10:08.454 --> 10:11.045
- Bart forgot this, sir.
- Sir?

10:11.080 --> 10:15.299
That's the kind of respect you'd have to
strangle out of an American kid.

10:15.334 --> 10:19.078
You know, Bart never told me
he had a handsome teenage brother.

10:21.227 --> 10:24.787
- Oh, uh, I'm really 38.
- 38 waist I might believe.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.743
Hey, Carl, got any idea what
direction Mecca's in?

10:30.778 --> 10:32.080
Why don't you ask Homer?

10:32.115 --> 10:35.262
He ought to know, by dint
of his son's new friend.

10:36.252 --> 10:37.985
Hey, Bashir's great.

10:38.020 --> 10:41.163
If Derek Jeter married
Mariah Carey-- wouldn't last

10:41.198 --> 10:43.753
but I bet they'd have
a kid like him.

10:43.788 --> 10:48.254
Homer, this is serious. This Bashir kid is Muslim,
and therefore up to something.

10:48.289 --> 10:51.383
Oh, I can't believe that
till I see a fictional TV program

10:51.418 --> 10:53.691
espousing your point of view.

10:55.669 --> 10:58.892
<i>For the last time, Fayed,
where did you hide the nerve gas?!</i>

10:58.927 --> 11:01.627
<i>Under your Statue of Liberty's dress!</i>

11:01.662 --> 11:03.034
<i>And she loved it!</i>

11:03.332 --> 11:05.671
Oh, my God.
What can I do?

11:05.706 --> 11:08.868
Well, if you want to stop Bashir
and his war on American principles,

11:08.903 --> 11:12.290
you could discriminate against his family
in employment and housing.

11:12.325 --> 11:14.711
That's pretty patriotic,
but I got a better idea.

11:14.746 --> 11:17.805
Invite 'em over.
A little dinner, a little dessert,

11:17.840 --> 11:21.104
and then you Jack Bauer 'em
into giving you all their secrets.

11:22.595 --> 11:25.713
I guess I have no choice.

11:27.741 --> 11:29.852
Homie, it's very open-minded of you

11:29.887 --> 11:33.314
to have Bart's Muslim
friend's Muslim family over.

11:33.470 --> 11:36.228
Here's the plan, Marge.
You keep them talking.

11:36.263 --> 11:40.334
I'll be listening
and quietly judging.

11:41.721 --> 11:45.534
The doorbell will tell
you when they're here.

11:46.382 --> 11:49.758
So, how did you two meet?

11:49.793 --> 11:53.867
We met while studying at Jordan University
of Science and Technology.

11:53.902 --> 11:56.662
Ah, interesting.
Why, just the other day,

11:56.697 --> 12:00.966
I was reading that science
is used to make bombs.

12:03.874 --> 12:05.899
Now, bait the trap.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.724
Why don't I get us dessert?

12:11.692 --> 12:13.409
I made us a little cake.

12:13.444 --> 12:15.626
Care to cut?

12:15.661 --> 12:17.904
Watch this, Lenny.

12:17.939 --> 12:20.618
Not now.
I got soap in my eyes.

12:20.653 --> 12:22.262
No, thank you.

12:22.297 --> 12:25.741
What's the matter?
Don't like the taste of freedom?

12:25.776 --> 12:27.742
Dad, these people
are my friends.

12:27.777 --> 12:29.814
Don't fear them just because
they have a different religion,

12:29.849 --> 12:32.086
a different culture, and their
last name is Bin Laden.

12:32.121 --> 12:35.311
Young man, you do not
respect us by disrespecting your father.

12:35.346 --> 12:37.178
I like the way
you Italians think.

12:37.213 --> 12:39.130
Shut up, old man.

12:39.165 --> 12:42.341
I think it is time
for us to go.

12:42.576 --> 12:45.882
That's it.
Ruin a perfect evening.

12:45.917 --> 12:49.805
You're teaching Bart
a terrible lesson of intolerance.

12:49.840 --> 12:54.199
I'm sorry. It's just so fun and easy
to judge people based on religion.

12:54.234 --> 12:57.555
Well, I want you to go over
to their house and apologize.

12:57.590 --> 13:02.111
But we're the more powerful
country for a few more years.

13:02.146 --> 13:05.489
Okay, I'll apologize.

13:07.810 --> 13:09.606
Don't eat that, sweetie.

13:09.641 --> 13:12.204
It's poison.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.722
I am sorry I suspected you

13:19.757 --> 13:22.545
of being soulless murders
of innocent children.

13:22.580 --> 13:24.867
I hope we can move
past this and...

13:29.953 --> 13:32.796
Dynamite?
They are terrorists.

13:32.831 --> 13:35.355
Must leave quietly.

13:43.241 --> 13:45.696
So far, so good.

13:50.122 --> 13:54.362
Marge! I was right!
Everybody is whatever I think they are.

13:54.397 --> 13:57.291
I saw them unloading dynamite.

13:57.394 --> 14:00.974
Homer, I'm sure you
didn't see anything. Go to sleep.

14:01.009 --> 14:05.299
All right, sweetie, but if I
wake up tomorrow, we'll discuss it.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.447
Hi, Homer!

14:22.918 --> 14:26.537
You rubbed? You must like me.
You really, really like me.

14:26.572 --> 14:30.699
Good morning, Ramadan!
Come to Crazy Fayeddie's!

14:30.734 --> 14:33.035
Our prices are Hussein!

14:34.336 --> 14:36.030
Here's... Genie!

14:36.957 --> 14:38.516
- Now do Flanders.
- No.

14:38.551 --> 14:42.336
Now I will destroy your
decadent Western society.

14:57.281 --> 14:59.462
No...!

15:00.117 --> 15:02.391
Usually that ends the dream.

15:04.765 --> 15:09.280
The power of dreaming has
convinced me the threat is real.

15:13.395 --> 15:14.977
Delivery for Lisa Simpson.

15:15.853 --> 15:18.028
It's a gift from Mapple.

15:18.063 --> 15:20.231
Oh, such beautiful packaging.

15:20.266 --> 15:23.921
I never thought a company
could be my soul mate.

15:23.956 --> 15:26.921
Oh, it's my first MyBill.

15:26.956 --> 15:29.138
$1,200?!

15:29.173 --> 15:31.026
But I only downloaded...

15:31.061 --> 15:33.535
1,212 songs.

15:39.549 --> 15:43.080
I got to prove
the genie was right.

15:43.115 --> 15:44.121
Off to work.

15:44.156 --> 15:47.616
Sometimes I wish you would
quit that awful business.

15:47.651 --> 15:50.279
But I love blowing up buildings.

15:50.314 --> 15:52.032
Oh, my God.

15:52.067 --> 15:55.586
Safely and legally, in order to
make room for new buildings.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.455
Darling, I think you are
working much too hard.

15:59.490 --> 16:03.125
Yes, I am killing myself,
but it is all for the profit,

16:03.160 --> 16:06.795
and after the explosion,
I will be in a better place.

16:07.740 --> 16:10.580
That corner office
with the downtown view.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.459
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

16:25.494 --> 16:29.317
I want to apologize for
being such a jerk at dinner,

16:29.352 --> 16:31.616
and I thought the best

16:31.651 --> 16:34.609
way to do that would be to come
to your house and poke around.

16:34.644 --> 16:37.105
Mr. Simpson,
I accept your apology.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.664
- Good-bye.
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:38.699 --> 16:41.954
I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests.

16:41.989 --> 16:43.742
Is that true?

16:43.777 --> 16:44.777
Yes.

16:44.812 --> 16:46.724
Praise be Oliver.

16:46.759 --> 16:48.045
That's Allah.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.048
Yeah... we'll look
it up in the Corona.

16:52.766 --> 16:55.614
So... now that we're alone,

16:55.649 --> 16:58.123
um... death to America, right?

16:58.158 --> 17:00.655
Homer, why are you really here?

17:00.690 --> 17:04.310
Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste.
Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.576
A computer.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.404
I'm in.

17:19.285 --> 17:21.530
Springfield Mall?

17:25.242 --> 17:26.823
They're going to blow it up.

17:26.858 --> 17:29.319
Homer, I don't hear almond grinding.

17:29.354 --> 17:31.547
Just listen.

17:31.582 --> 17:34.360
I'm grinding them now.

17:36.512 --> 17:38.805
Ow, my finger!

17:38.840 --> 17:40.528
Ooh, here comes the ambulance.

17:42.977 --> 17:44.930
My, you're a handsome fellow.

17:44.965 --> 17:48.525
Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson.
We'll see to your finger.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.640
Why, thank you.

17:52.129 --> 17:53.360
Ow, my finger!

17:53.395 --> 17:55.654
SPINGFIELD MALL

17:56.280 --> 17:58.574
Everyone, get out!

17:59.051 --> 18:01.040
Run for your lives!

18:01.075 --> 18:03.314
Run for your--

18:03.349 --> 18:04.455
uh, stay where you are.

18:06.557 --> 18:07.557
Bart!

18:10.994 --> 18:12.461
Boy, don't blow up this mall.

18:12.496 --> 18:15.048
It has the cookie store
that gives free samples.

18:16.153 --> 18:18.343
OLD SPRINGFIELD MALL
DEMOLITION TODAY

18:19.379 --> 18:22.648
I can't believe your dad
gets paid to blow stuff up.

18:22.683 --> 18:25.698
Actually, Bart, my job is
about math and engineering.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.908
Every calculation is to make
sure the explosion is safe.

18:28.943 --> 18:30.856
Did you factor in
one bald idiot?

18:30.891 --> 18:32.690
No, I...

18:32.725 --> 18:35.655
USA! USA! USA!

18:49.791 --> 18:53.649
Dad, it was an empty building.
It was supposed to come down.

18:53.684 --> 18:56.754
- What about the bridge?
- That was supposed to open tomorrow.

18:56.789 --> 18:58.591
Did we really need
a bridge there?

18:58.626 --> 19:00.836
The Duff brewery
is on that island.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.896
I'll save you!

19:18.257 --> 19:19.917
PARDON MY INTOLERANCE

19:19.952 --> 19:23.282
That banner has really paid
for itself over the years.

19:23.317 --> 19:25.043
We accept your apology.

19:25.078 --> 19:28.034
Lisa, add another name
to our Christmas card list.

19:28.069 --> 19:30.457
Next to our Jewish friends.

19:30.662 --> 19:32.417
Where is Lisa?

19:32.650 --> 19:34.899
She said something about
"the bottom of the ocean"

19:34.934 --> 19:36.004
and "be back in a month."

19:40.561 --> 19:42.714
Welcome to Mapple Headquarters.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.889
The cost of this journey
will be added to your bill.

19:49.093 --> 19:51.804
Come on... come on.

19:51.839 --> 19:54.331
Yes! 16 million results.

19:54.366 --> 19:56.342
Mr. Mobbs, there's a surface
dweller here to see you--

19:56.377 --> 19:58.905
MyTunes user JazzGal62.

19:59.427 --> 20:01.431
Hmm... oh, Lisa Simpson.
Send her in.

20:05.992 --> 20:08.613
Lisa, it's insanely
great to see you.

20:09.199 --> 20:14.835
Um, Mr. Mobbs, I sort of downloaded
too many songs onto my MyPod,

20:14.870 --> 20:17.929
and I don't have the money
to pay for them.

20:17.964 --> 20:20.156
And do you think
you could consider

20:20.191 --> 20:21.717
a reduced payment plan?

20:21.752 --> 20:25.721
I'm sorry. I know our posters
say "Think differently,"

20:25.756 --> 20:28.098
but our real slogan
is "No refunds."

20:29.974 --> 20:34.645
can't you open your Mapple menu
and click on the compassion bar?

20:34.680 --> 20:35.981
Oh, please.

20:37.426 --> 20:39.647
Lisa, how would you
like to work for Mapple?

20:40.367 --> 20:41.904
Would I ever.

20:42.076 --> 20:44.144
Think differently.

20:44.179 --> 20:46.414
Think differently.

20:46.449 --> 20:48.825
Think differently.

20:50.852 --> 20:52.956
Think differently.
