00:01.625 --> 00:03.583
[Narrator]
Previously on X-Men.

00:06.833 --> 00:08.125
[Female mutant]
Tracker!

00:10.375 --> 00:11.708
[growling]

00:12.958 --> 00:14.250
[grunts]

00:14.250 --> 00:16.708
Tracker Bishop no longer needed.

00:16.708 --> 00:17.875
What do you mean?

00:19.416 --> 00:21.500
This is Bishop. He's with me.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.291
You rebels
have a working time portal?

00:24.291 --> 00:26.708
[Forge]
We rebels have a theory.

00:26.708 --> 00:29.958
If the assassination
of the '90s never occurred...

00:29.958 --> 00:32.958
Then none of this misery
would have happened?

00:32.958 --> 00:35.500
None of the Sentinels,
none of the camps,

00:35.500 --> 00:37.083
none of the terminations?

00:37.083 --> 00:38.250
[Forge]
Go in peace.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.500
[grunts]

00:42.583 --> 00:44.875
[groaning]

00:44.875 --> 00:46.583
Mr. Terminator here claims

00:46.583 --> 00:49.000
that an assassination's
gonna take place

00:49.000 --> 00:51.083
that's gonna ruin the world,

00:51.083 --> 00:53.583
and one of us X-Men
is the trigger!

00:53.583 --> 00:55.000
A new Sentinel?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.625
From my time, from the future!

00:57.625 --> 01:00.333
Which one of us is the assassin?

01:00.333 --> 01:01.375
[theme music playing]

02:00.583 --> 02:01.750
[tires screeching]

02:04.333 --> 02:06.250
[truck horn honking]

02:08.125 --> 02:10.416
Hey, watch the road, Chere!

02:10.416 --> 02:12.166
Where you learn to drive?

02:12.166 --> 02:14.458
With good old boys
on country back roads,

02:14.458 --> 02:16.625
best teachers in the world!

02:16.625 --> 02:18.708
[Gambit]
Maybe time
you had another lesson, eh?

02:21.166 --> 02:23.208
Who's gonna teach me, you?

02:23.208 --> 02:25.833
Sure, I teach you
plenty of things

02:25.833 --> 02:27.500
if you ask me nice.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.333
[grunts]

02:30.333 --> 02:31.500
Don't you ever get tired

02:31.500 --> 02:33.250
of listening to yourself?

02:33.250 --> 02:35.875
Not when I'm talking
about you, Chere.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.958
[exclaims]

02:37.958 --> 02:39.708
Don't worry, Rogue!

02:39.708 --> 02:41.083
I park the car!

02:42.500 --> 02:44.458
[Storm]
It could be any one of us.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.958
We all have dark sides
to our souls.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.500
[Wolverine]
Speak for yourself, lady.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.125
I know an X-Man is the assassin.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.000
One day I'll remember who.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
My, my, don't you all
look serious.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And we've got company, too!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.458
What's up?

03:02.458 --> 03:04.125
Rogue, this is Bishop.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.000
Everyone can relax.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.000
Gambit has returned.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.375
You!

03:10.375 --> 03:12.000
You're the reason
I've come back!

03:13.458 --> 03:14.458
Traitor!

03:14.458 --> 03:16.708
Your future ends now!

03:20.250 --> 03:21.416
[Rogue]
No!

03:24.458 --> 03:25.458
Stop this!

03:27.583 --> 03:30.958
-[grunts]
-Gambit's one of us,
you tattooed freak!

03:32.416 --> 03:34.375
This fighting ends now!

03:34.375 --> 03:36.375
He's the assassin!

03:36.375 --> 03:38.333
He has to be terminated!

03:38.333 --> 03:41.000
Somebody say assassin?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.708
I hate to be demanding,

03:42.708 --> 03:45.833
but would one of you all
mind telling me what's going on?

03:45.833 --> 03:47.750
His name is Bishop, Gambit.

03:47.750 --> 03:50.250
He claims to be
a time traveler,

03:50.250 --> 03:51.583
from the future.

03:51.583 --> 03:55.125
Yes, and I'm
the queen of France!

03:55.125 --> 03:57.416
That's the best kind of lie,

03:57.416 --> 03:59.625
one can't nobody prove.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.166
You're the liar, traitor!

04:02.166 --> 04:04.583
Your stupid friends
have saved your life

04:04.583 --> 04:06.333
so you can betray them!

04:06.333 --> 04:07.875
[Wolverine]
Time out, rookie!

04:07.875 --> 04:10.958
You mean time's up
for all of you!

04:10.958 --> 04:14.833
Because of him, the whole world
is going to be enslaved!

04:14.833 --> 04:18.291
Everything you believe in
will lie in ashes!

04:18.291 --> 04:21.625
And the X-Men are going to die.

04:21.625 --> 04:25.166
It starts with a single death
in Washington, DC.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.458
The assassin is Gambit,

04:29.458 --> 04:32.083
but all mutants get blamed.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.875
[Woman crying]

04:35.875 --> 04:37.625
People are afraid.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.875
They want action,
they want protection.

04:39.875 --> 04:41.708
They want revenge.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.875
The Mutant Control Law
is passed,

04:44.875 --> 04:47.000
calling for an army
of Sentinels.

04:48.875 --> 04:52.000
They march over the nation,
seeking out mutants,

04:52.000 --> 04:53.708
hunting them down like animals.

04:55.375 --> 04:56.875
[Sentinels]
Surrender, mutant.

04:56.875 --> 04:58.583
[Bishop]
Some fight back.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.583
[groaning]

05:00.958 --> 05:02.000
[groans]

05:03.625 --> 05:05.833
But not for long.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.000
The Sentinels herd
the surviving mutants

05:08.000 --> 05:10.625
into detention camps.

05:10.625 --> 05:13.750
The camps are your final stop.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.166
You never leave.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.000
Never.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.083
But those who control

05:19.083 --> 05:20.125
the Sentinels

05:20.125 --> 05:21.375
don't stop with mutants.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.000
Eventually, they bring
their new world order

05:25.000 --> 05:26.500
to all humans.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.000
[people screaming]

05:30.708 --> 05:31.833
[Soldier 1]
What the hell is going on here?

05:31.833 --> 05:33.750
[shouting, yelling]

05:41.000 --> 05:42.500
[rumbling]

05:42.500 --> 05:43.708
[screaming]

05:55.875 --> 05:59.166
I've hated you all my life.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.708
Easy, rookie.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.583
If you prevent
this assassination,

06:04.583 --> 06:06.583
will the future you describe

06:06.583 --> 06:08.000
be averted?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.333
That was the theory that led

06:09.333 --> 06:11.000
a mutant inventor named Forge

06:11.000 --> 06:12.958
to create this armband.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.083
It puts out a temporal
displacement field

06:15.083 --> 06:18.291
that allows me to remain here,
in the past.

06:18.291 --> 06:21.333
Who is Gambit supposed
to assassinate?

06:21.333 --> 06:22.708
I don't know.

06:22.708 --> 06:25.000
I only know it happens soon,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.208
in Washington.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.750
It could be the President.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.083
It could be anyone.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.166
I'm going to Washington
for the Senate hearings

06:32.166 --> 06:34.000
on Mutant Affairs.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.125
Perhaps he kills me.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.750
Hey, that's not funny.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.583
It wasn't intended as a joke.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.000
I've devoted my life

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
to helping mutants
and non-mutants

06:45.000 --> 06:46.500
live together in peace.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.458
You don't take
this poseur serious?

06:49.458 --> 06:51.000
What we know about him?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.083
Only a little more
than we know about you.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.208
You've never been straight
with us,

06:56.208 --> 06:57.708
not completely.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.583
I say we blow this liar

06:59.583 --> 07:01.750
right back where he come from.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.875
You do, and we'll know
he's telling the truth.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.125
[Storm]
Wolverine! Gambit!

07:07.125 --> 07:10.000
Gambit, I know you better
than anyone.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.083
But even if Bishop
had accused me,

07:12.083 --> 07:14.458
I would not know
that he was lying.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.333
We are all capable of evil.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.875
Don't nobody trust Gambit, eh?

07:20.958 --> 07:23.875
Then Gambit don't need nobody.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.875
[Bishop]
Going somewhere,

07:35.875 --> 07:37.000
traitor?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.708
Just out of curiosity, gumbo,

07:41.708 --> 07:43.375
where are you going?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.458
Washington.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.000
He even admits it!

07:46.000 --> 07:49.166
I'm going to stop
this assassination,

07:49.166 --> 07:51.208
if there really is one.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.250
[Cyclops]
We can't let you go, Gambit.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.750
It is the only way
to be certain.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.458
Bishop stays behind also.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.625
We'll be here
when you get back,

08:00.625 --> 08:04.000
only one of us
may not be breathing.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.625
But which one?

08:05.625 --> 08:08.833
You kids
better behave yourselves.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.375
I'm staying behind to baby-sit.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.083
[BISHOP]
I should've known better
than to play poker

08:25.083 --> 08:26.583
with an assassin.

08:26.583 --> 08:27.958
Shut up, fool!

08:29.875 --> 08:32.416
I can absorb your bio-energy,

08:32.416 --> 08:34.750
and channel it right back!

08:34.750 --> 08:37.375
I think he's getting ready
to raise you.

08:37.375 --> 08:38.458
[grunting]

08:38.458 --> 08:40.958
That's my mutant power.

08:40.958 --> 08:43.875
[Wolverine]
How would you like
to try absorbing these?

08:43.875 --> 08:46.208
Now sit down, both of you!

08:46.208 --> 08:47.708
Or cards won't be the only thing

08:47.708 --> 08:49.416
that gets cut around here!

08:54.333 --> 08:55.833
I am in position.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.625
You see anything,
just give us a holler.

08:57.625 --> 09:00.708
-[beeping]
-Gambit, stop.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.958
No.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.375
It's not true.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.833
Nice sunrise.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.375
[belches]

09:10.375 --> 09:12.416
Lovely sentiment, old Blob.

09:12.416 --> 09:15.375
A spiffing day
for an assassination.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.000
[Mystique]
And if we fail,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.125
you will be eliminated.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.166
The Senate Subcommittee
on Mutant Affairs

09:21.166 --> 09:22.708
meets again today to consider

09:22.708 --> 09:24.958
the proper place
of mutants in society.

09:24.958 --> 09:27.500
You gonna play cards
or watch TV?

09:27.500 --> 09:28.875
[Wolverine]
It's your deal, Cajun.

09:28.875 --> 09:32.125
And no more wild card games!

09:32.125 --> 09:34.000
[Bishop]
I still think he's cheating.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.333
Then you better cut the cards.

09:37.958 --> 09:38.958
[Bishop]
Hey!

09:40.083 --> 09:42.000
[Wolverine]
Gambit! Stop!

09:42.000 --> 09:43.583
[both grunting]

09:45.166 --> 09:47.458
Believe me now, smart guy?

09:47.458 --> 09:49.250
[Wolverine]
Shut up, rookie!

09:49.250 --> 09:50.708
[sniffing]

09:50.708 --> 09:51.708
This way.

09:59.416 --> 10:01.166
[Bishop]
You let him get away!

10:01.166 --> 10:03.333
I didn't see you doing much!

10:03.333 --> 10:06.333
No wonder you sent me back
to change the future,

10:06.333 --> 10:09.208
because everything that happens
is your fault!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I still don't believe it.

10:19.375 --> 10:22.458
-Humans, yes! Mutants, no!
-Humans, yes! Mutants, no!

10:22.458 --> 10:25.291
-Humans, yes! Mutants, no!
-Humans, yes! Mutants, no!

10:25.291 --> 10:29.333
Shall we begin the diversion,
Avalanche, old darling?

10:29.333 --> 10:31.500
We'll bring the house down,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.416
and the Senate, too.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.333
-Mutants, no! Humans, yes!
-Mutants, no! Humans, yes!

10:36.333 --> 10:38.708
[Kelly]
Professor Xavier,

10:38.708 --> 10:40.750
have you associated
in the past

10:40.750 --> 10:43.458
with renegade mutants?

10:43.458 --> 10:45.333
No, Senator, I have not.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.875
Then it isn't true

10:46.875 --> 10:49.458
that your school for the gifted

10:49.458 --> 10:51.250
is really a clearing house

10:51.250 --> 10:53.250
for pro-mutant propaganda?

10:54.375 --> 10:56.458
My school is dedicated
to the idea

10:56.458 --> 10:58.625
that mutants can live
peacefully

10:58.625 --> 11:00.708
-alongside ordinary humans--
-You're here
to answer questions.

11:00.708 --> 11:02.875
[people chattering]

11:02.875 --> 11:03.958
[Woman]
Oh, my God!

11:04.958 --> 11:06.291
Right on time.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.875
[guards exclaiming]

11:12.333 --> 11:15.083
I got your answers right here!

11:19.833 --> 11:22.708
Stop them before they bring
the whole building down!

11:22.708 --> 11:25.583
Perhaps we'll burn it down
instead!

11:31.458 --> 11:33.458
[both screaming]

11:36.000 --> 11:38.583
[Xavier]
X-Men, come to the Capitol
at once.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.875
X-Men, come to the Capitol
at once.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.375
-Humans, yes! Mutants, no!
-Humans, yes! Mutants, no!

12:01.125 --> 12:02.166
[grunting]

12:12.208 --> 12:13.875
Hey, what's going on?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.208
-[Cyclops grunts]
-What's your hurry, four-eyes?

12:22.208 --> 12:24.250
[laughing]

12:24.250 --> 12:26.750
You gonna be laughing out
the other side of your chubby
face.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.166
[grunting]

12:43.458 --> 12:44.500
[Rogue]
Look out!

12:53.083 --> 12:54.458
[all grunting]

13:06.416 --> 13:08.750
[Rogue grunting]

13:12.500 --> 13:15.416
[Blob]
I'm gonna flatten
these X-Clowns

13:15.416 --> 13:17.708
by sitting on them!

13:17.708 --> 13:19.875
[exclaims in disgust]
That's gross!

13:21.500 --> 13:23.416
[belches]

13:23.416 --> 13:24.583
[gasps]

13:24.583 --> 13:26.958
Goodness, was that me?

13:30.750 --> 13:33.583
Nothing hurts the Blob!

13:33.583 --> 13:36.291
Okay, round boy!

13:36.291 --> 13:37.750
Let's dance!

13:37.750 --> 13:40.625
[Blob]
Hey, get off of me!

13:40.625 --> 13:42.125
Come on!

13:42.125 --> 13:44.375
Get away! Get...

13:46.125 --> 13:47.375
Now, Storm!

13:49.125 --> 13:53.166
I summon the cold
of the Arctic winds!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.750
Hey!

13:54.750 --> 13:58.291
[shivering]
I'm freezing in here.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.708
[wind whooshing]

13:59.708 --> 14:01.708
Let's make an igloo.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.416
[Cyclops]
Wolverine!

14:03.416 --> 14:04.833
What are you doing here?

14:04.833 --> 14:06.291
Where are Gambit and Bishop?

14:06.291 --> 14:08.416
[Bishop]
Eat plasma, renegade!

14:08.416 --> 14:10.625
-[screaming]
-[gun firing]

14:10.625 --> 14:12.875
[Pyro exclaiming]

14:12.875 --> 14:15.583
The Cajun assassin
got the jump on us.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.083
Where's Gambit?

14:17.083 --> 14:20.000
He's supposed to be with you.
And you!

14:23.458 --> 14:26.625
Give it to them straight up,
Avalanche!

14:29.875 --> 14:31.333
[Wolverine]
Look out, Cyke!

14:31.333 --> 14:33.750
-Bishop!
-It's all right!

14:33.750 --> 14:34.833
He can take it!

14:38.166 --> 14:39.291
[screaming]

14:46.583 --> 14:48.708
-[Man] Let's get out of here!
-[people screaming]

14:48.708 --> 14:50.083
It's too heavy.

14:53.708 --> 14:54.708
[exhales]

14:57.125 --> 14:59.083
[girl crying]

15:05.375 --> 15:08.000
"He who fights
and runs away..."

15:08.000 --> 15:10.583
Just shut up and run!

15:10.583 --> 15:11.708
Are you all right?

15:11.708 --> 15:12.750
[girl crying]

15:12.750 --> 15:15.250
This kid's crying. Do something.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.083
We must move quickly, Cyclops.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.708
Two of the renegades
are escaping.

15:19.708 --> 15:21.625
Wait, Storm! Where's Bishop?

15:22.833 --> 15:24.375
Rogue, can you see Bishop?

15:25.583 --> 15:28.416
I could spit on him
if I wasn't a lady.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.291
Looks like he's running
for Congress.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.333
Bishop!

15:39.875 --> 15:42.333
You should be safe in here,
Senator.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.208
-What's going on?
-[muffled screaming]

15:50.000 --> 15:51.083
You're about

15:51.083 --> 15:53.416
to make history, mon ami.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.291
All we need is a witness.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.250
You tell them all,

16:00.250 --> 16:01.583
this is what happens

16:01.583 --> 16:03.875
when you go against mutants.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.708
Especially Gambit and the X-Men.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.250
-[door opening]
-Hey!

16:08.250 --> 16:10.500
Surprised to see me?

16:10.500 --> 16:11.750
I know I am.

16:17.708 --> 16:18.708
[grunting]

16:23.708 --> 16:25.291
Are you all right, Senator?

16:26.333 --> 16:27.875
[grunting]

16:30.458 --> 16:33.833
Maybe you not as tough
as I look, non?

16:33.833 --> 16:34.833
Traitor!

16:42.875 --> 16:44.833
It's all right, Senator.
It's over.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.458
Two of you?

16:48.458 --> 16:50.458
That one's an imposter,

16:50.458 --> 16:51.625
a shape-shifter.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.208
Maybe.

16:54.208 --> 16:55.583
Better take you both out

16:55.583 --> 16:57.708
just to be sure.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.583
At full force.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.000
[Rogue]
Don't you hurt him, Bishop.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.583
What are you doing?

17:03.583 --> 17:06.250
I'm sending you back
where you belong!

17:06.250 --> 17:07.833
No!

17:07.833 --> 17:08.875
No!

17:12.166 --> 17:13.833
It's all over, Mr. Kelly.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.208
Now go on and let us be.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.583
Please, Senator,
just do what she says.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.291
[gasps]

17:24.708 --> 17:26.125
[Rogue]
You!

17:26.125 --> 17:27.833
This is gonna be
more satisfying

17:27.833 --> 17:29.208
than I thought.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.291
You won't hurt me, Rogue.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.291
You're going to help me escape.

17:33.291 --> 17:36.333
Now why would I do
a crazy thing like that?

17:36.333 --> 17:38.125
Because once I looked like...

17:39.583 --> 17:41.500
this.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.875
Mama!

17:42.875 --> 17:44.458
That's what I told you
to call me

17:44.458 --> 17:46.333
after I took you in.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.250
What you called me
until the day you ran away.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.708
Now, are you gonna help me

17:51.708 --> 17:53.458
the way I once helped you?

17:55.458 --> 17:56.458
Hold it.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.000
[sniffing]

17:58.000 --> 17:59.708
I smell something oily.

18:01.708 --> 18:02.750
[grunts]

18:02.750 --> 18:04.333
Are you all right, Senator?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.625
What I am is confused!

18:06.625 --> 18:09.416
First one of you mutants
tries to kill me,

18:09.416 --> 18:11.416
then another one saves me,

18:11.416 --> 18:13.708
only it's the same one!

18:13.708 --> 18:15.416
There's a woman
who looked like me,

18:15.416 --> 18:16.708
who changed into a man,

18:16.708 --> 18:19.208
and, well, it's back there!

18:20.250 --> 18:22.333
A shape-shifter!

18:22.333 --> 18:25.000
That explains why Bishop
thought Gambit was the assassin.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.500
What's he doing, taking a nap?

18:36.875 --> 18:38.458
All right, Mama,

18:38.458 --> 18:39.833
we're safe now.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.250
You may be,

18:41.250 --> 18:44.083
but I have failed Apocalypse.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.875
He wanted Kelly assassinated,

18:46.875 --> 18:48.333
to ensure the human race

18:48.333 --> 18:50.125
the future it deserves.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.125
Leave him!

18:51.125 --> 18:53.250
He made me what I am,

18:53.250 --> 18:54.375
gave me purpose.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.625
Just like Professor Xavier did
with you.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.000
It ain't the same, Mama!

19:02.000 --> 19:04.125
Apocalypse wants slaves,

19:04.125 --> 19:05.875
like you tried to turn me into

19:05.875 --> 19:07.583
back on Muir Island!

19:07.583 --> 19:08.583
Why?

19:10.125 --> 19:12.125
It seemed like the only way

19:12.125 --> 19:13.166
to get you back.

19:25.458 --> 19:26.750
[screaming]

19:28.458 --> 19:30.625
I'm back in the future again!

19:30.625 --> 19:32.125
Nothing's changed.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.250
It's all just like I left it.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.250
[door opening]

19:36.291 --> 19:37.750
You can try again,

19:37.750 --> 19:39.833
and again if you have to,

19:39.833 --> 19:41.708
once the machine is rebuilt.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.583
The one thing
we have plenty of is time.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.708
But I didn't fail, Forge!

19:49.708 --> 19:52.208
I stopped the assassination!

19:52.208 --> 19:55.333
Then something else
must've happened afterwards,

19:55.333 --> 19:57.208
something that has made
the future

19:57.208 --> 19:59.250
still turn out like this.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.583
Why does Senator Kelly
want to see you, Professor?

20:01.583 --> 20:03.083
Perhaps now he's ready

20:03.083 --> 20:05.208
to listen to my proposals.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.458
Wait!

20:06.458 --> 20:07.500
There's something wrong.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.750
[Kelly]
No!

20:08.750 --> 20:10.291
[explosion]

20:15.375 --> 20:17.166
[Cyclops]
Kelly's gone, Professor.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.750
There must've been
more mutants in the gang

20:18.750 --> 20:19.750
than we knew about.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.000
I don't believe this is the work
of the same gang.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.708
[Jean]
Why not, Professor?

20:26.708 --> 20:30.166
[Xavier]
Because my watch has stopped.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.250
I don't understand.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.583
Why is that important?

20:39.583 --> 20:43.583
Because it's been magnetized.
