00:34.750 --> 00:36.208
You all right there, laddies?

00:47.166 --> 00:48.166
Mum?

00:49.500 --> 00:50.500
It's me.

00:53.625 --> 00:54.625
It's Simon.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.000
Someone wants to talk to you.

01:08.708 --> 01:09.708
It's Mum.

01:26.541 --> 01:27.666
Tell her who you are.

01:32.541 --> 01:33.541
What?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.375
Tell her you're Jack's daughter.

01:45.833 --> 01:46.833
I can't.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.166
Why are you doing this?

01:55.250 --> 01:57.166
Tell her how he lied to you.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.583
To you and your mum.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.333
How we weren't the only ones
he screwed over.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.500
Tell her we're his real family.

02:22.541 --> 02:23.541
Tell her.

02:28.791 --> 02:29.791
Let me go.

02:33.916 --> 02:34.916
Please.

03:34.375 --> 03:35.666
Pull!

03:35.750 --> 03:36.833
I am pulling.

03:46.708 --> 03:49.625
You pull harder. I got
a goddamn shovel in my hand.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.416
Here. Give it to me.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.375
Shit.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.166
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

05:03.250 --> 05:04.083
Hello.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.125
Hey, it's Denise.
I just got in and saw

05:06.208 --> 05:07.601
your cameras are down.
Everything okay?

05:07.625 --> 05:09.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

05:09.791 --> 05:11.059
Do you want me to
come check it out?

05:11.083 --> 05:14.291
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's probably just a power cut.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.642
Well, I should come
check it out, just to be safe.

05:16.666 --> 05:18.416
No, no. Um, no, seriously,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.250
I don't want you
to go to any trouble.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.416
No, it's no trouble.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.083
No. Deni...

05:51.666 --> 05:52.750
Okay.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.041
Move.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.457
What the fuck are you doing?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.375
Fucking having a break.

08:38.957 --> 08:39.957
A break?

08:40.291 --> 08:41.666
We just started.

08:43.332 --> 08:44.458
There's only one shovel.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.208
Shit.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.208
What the fuck was that?

09:49.750 --> 09:50.750
Keep digging.

09:52.541 --> 09:53.541
Okay.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.583
Hello?

10:13.041 --> 10:14.041
All right?

10:17.458 --> 10:18.458
I burned down the house.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.625
How about that.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.375
I got what you wanted.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.708
What?

10:28.833 --> 10:29.833
Where are you?

10:30.333 --> 10:31.333
Randy's.

10:34.541 --> 10:35.541
Okay.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
What the hell happened?

10:52.541 --> 10:53.750
I left the gas on.

10:55.041 --> 10:56.291
Are you okay? Is anyone hurt?

10:56.375 --> 10:58.750
No, I was the only one home.
Thank God.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.708
Did you call
the fire department?

11:00.791 --> 11:01.791
Yes.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.500
Right away.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.916
- Do you need the paramedics?
- No.

11:07.666 --> 11:08.916
I need to find Jim.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.291
Unit Three?

11:25.041 --> 11:25.958
Unit Three.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.583
Fire at the Worth house.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.166
You got eyes on the Chief?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.666
Try the hotel. Why?

11:31.041 --> 11:33.791
Because I'm arresting him
for the murder of Roger Crouch.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.458
Nick, he has an alibi.

11:39.375 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, I'm sure you buy it.
Jury won't.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.166
You all right?

11:49.916 --> 11:50.916
Not really.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.238
Did you leave a duck
in the oven?

12:04.333 --> 12:05.333
Jack...

12:10.833 --> 12:11.958
I got something for you.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.750
Tada.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.416
Christ, Jack.

12:52.750 --> 12:53.750
He's number two.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.875
Why the woman?

12:56.625 --> 12:57.625
Keep him chatty.

13:32.958 --> 13:33.958
Anna.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.500
Forgive me.

13:41.750 --> 13:42.750
You have to.

13:43.750 --> 13:44.750
Or what?

13:46.333 --> 13:47.333
What do you want?

13:49.208 --> 13:50.208
I'm sorry.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.333
Sorry?

13:58.791 --> 14:01.833
Sorry is a broken fucking cup,
not a dead kid.

14:17.916 --> 14:18.916
Kill me.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.208
It's what I deserve.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.500
No, you, you said
it was an accident.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.583
So?

14:39.416 --> 14:40.416
So you didn't mean it.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.083
I still came here
to kill your dad.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.750
Because of what he did to you.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.333
Do it.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.875
I don't deserve to live.
Anna, do it.

15:03.666 --> 15:04.666
Do it.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.375
Do it!

15:56.041 --> 15:57.125
Who shot our son?

16:01.958 --> 16:03.000
She loved you.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.041
When she found out

16:09.083 --> 16:13.500
you'd been raping her on behalf
of Her Majesty's Government,

16:16.833 --> 16:19.500
she tried to drink herself
to death.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.458
Ended up with wet brain.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.767
You have any idea
what that's like, Jack?

16:26.791 --> 16:28.958
Wet brain?

16:34.541 --> 16:35.625
Who pulled the trigger?

16:38.750 --> 16:40.125
So what did you tell yourself?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.833
That you did what you did
out of duty?

16:45.583 --> 16:47.125
You blew way past duty.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.083
You're a fucking crook,
same as me,

16:52.625 --> 16:55.458
you just joined a gang
with uniforms.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.541
Fuck you!

17:17.040 --> 17:19.165
Or maybe you told yourself

17:19.250 --> 17:21.750
that you were a cop
with a family to feed.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.750
But that's a lie too, isn't it?

17:25.208 --> 17:29.875
Because you betrayed your family
like you betrayed mine.

17:45.416 --> 17:48.416
You're a fucking crook
just like the rest of us.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.833
But you do it guilt free.

17:50.916 --> 17:54.208
All because of your
pathetic little tin star.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.833
You know, the only thing
I regret, Jack,

18:04.583 --> 18:10.416
is the hatred I've wasted on
a lowlife prick fuck like you.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.613
Where's the little fella, Frank?

18:17.625 --> 18:18.875
Don't tell him, Frank.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.078
If you talk, he'll kill you.

18:20.125 --> 18:21.750
He can do what he
fucking likes to me.

18:21.833 --> 18:22.833
Stop this.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.416
- Please. Please.
- Go on.

18:24.541 --> 18:25.833
Just don't touch her.

18:25.916 --> 18:26.916
Don't touch...

18:30.083 --> 18:31.083
Jack.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.916
This is what you
asked for, right?

18:52.375 --> 18:53.375
I know.

18:56.666 --> 18:57.946
Well, this is how it goes, love.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.125
And what about the woman
and her wee boy?

19:12.416 --> 19:13.416
Kiss me.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.583
What the fuck?

20:02.791 --> 20:04.125
Who pulled the trigger, Frank?

20:05.125 --> 20:06.250
Who shot our boy?

20:14.666 --> 20:16.083
Two to the head,
one to the heart.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.875
Jack, Jack, no.

20:19.708 --> 20:20.708
Don't.

20:23.583 --> 20:24.583
Jack!

20:25.250 --> 20:27.958
Frank, don't let him kill me.
Please, please!

20:29.958 --> 20:30.958
Tell him.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.375
Who killed our son?

20:39.458 --> 20:40.291
Tell him.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.815
Don't let him kill me,
Frank. Please.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Fucking tell him!

20:47.625 --> 20:48.625
The boy.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.416
He had a favorite dog.

20:58.583 --> 20:59.583
All white.

21:10.458 --> 21:11.583
Whitey.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.583
- Whitey?
- Yeah.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
Whitey.

21:18.958 --> 21:19.958
Anna's with him.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.416
Chief Worth?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.309
We're going there to get Anna,
not to kill Whitey.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.458
Is that clear, Jack?

21:43.333 --> 21:46.041
You're under arrest
for the murder of Roger Crouch.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.583
Denise, I need immediate backup.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.583
Murder suspect's evading arrest.

21:49.666 --> 21:50.916
Jesus, what?

21:51.041 --> 21:53.351
Do not leave me to deal with
this son of a bitch on my own.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.615
You really have to do this now?

21:54.666 --> 21:56.083
Hey, get your hands

21:56.166 --> 21:57.766
in the motherfucking air,
you motherfu...

21:59.750 --> 22:01.708
Fuck!!

22:13.375 --> 22:14.375
Fuck!

22:15.083 --> 22:16.666
Fuck!!

22:33.666 --> 22:34.708
How do I look?

22:41.416 --> 22:43.625
You got aa little mark
right there.

22:45.791 --> 22:46.791
Yeah.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.500
It's a bit fucking crazy.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.625
Blowing the whistle
on a company employee

22:57.708 --> 22:58.958
that you stabbed in the back?

23:03.166 --> 23:05.208
When the authorities start
asking questions

23:05.291 --> 23:07.041
about a missing security agent,

23:07.125 --> 23:08.925
they're gonna find out
we went up against him.

23:09.458 --> 23:11.791
The more public we are
about it now, the better.

23:12.916 --> 23:14.833
This way we control the story.

23:21.250 --> 23:23.458
You are one hell of a liar.

23:25.416 --> 23:26.416
Thank you.

23:52.458 --> 23:53.458
Hey.

24:00.875 --> 24:01.875
What are you doing?

24:05.750 --> 24:07.708
What the fuck happened
in Little Big Bear?

24:09.500 --> 24:10.500
What?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.333
What? Gagnon just happened
to be waiting for us?

24:16.791 --> 24:18.250
My children were in danger.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.833
I saved your life.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.833
So what? I owe you now?

24:32.291 --> 24:33.833
You signed a statement.

24:33.916 --> 24:36.625
Now all you have to do
is sit in a boardroom.

24:44.791 --> 24:45.791
That's all I gotta do?

24:46.791 --> 24:48.208
That's all you gotta do.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.250
What the hell happened?

25:04.791 --> 25:05.791
Hello.

25:06.708 --> 25:07.708
Chief shot me.

25:07.791 --> 25:08.791
Where?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.625
- Right over there.
- No, where?

25:13.708 --> 25:16.250
Kneecap.

25:19.791 --> 25:21.291
You put your faith in him.

25:23.458 --> 25:24.458
Told ya.

25:25.166 --> 25:27.958
Told you he was dirt.
You wouldn't listen.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.333
I'm sorry.

25:29.416 --> 25:31.291
Just swear to God,
you nail the prick?

25:31.375 --> 25:33.250
I swear, I swear I'll nail him.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.041
I love you.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.791
Do these allegations implicate
North Stream itself?

26:09.458 --> 26:10.500
That depends.

26:10.583 --> 26:11.583
On what?

26:11.625 --> 26:13.166
There is no evidence to suggest.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.375
Monsieur Gagnon had
the support of the board,

26:15.458 --> 26:17.916
or indeed any other employee,
however,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.708
he is a company employee,
protecting company interests.

26:20.791 --> 26:23.750
And not only did he murder
a provincial doctor,

26:24.333 --> 26:26.125
he brutalized
an indigenous community

26:26.208 --> 26:27.666
that this woman is a member of.

26:28.125 --> 26:31.041
A mother, who lost
all three of her children.

26:31.625 --> 26:33.958
Her story brings
a whole new spin

26:34.041 --> 26:35.750
to the headline, "Dirty Oil."

26:36.166 --> 26:38.000
And if I publish that testimony,

26:39.083 --> 26:43.583
I guarantee you every company
with an ethical PR profile

26:43.666 --> 26:46.125
will drop North Stream
from its supplier list.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.666
Why would you publish this?
You work for us.

26:51.708 --> 26:53.291
I answer to my conscience.

26:59.791 --> 27:00.791
What do you want?

27:01.166 --> 27:02.958
When you offered me
a seat at the table,

27:03.375 --> 27:05.375
you told me
it was an opportunity

27:05.458 --> 27:08.125
to change the oil industry
from within.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
Horse shit.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.250
I had as much influence
over North Stream

27:14.333 --> 27:15.625
as the fucking caterers.

27:16.291 --> 27:17.458
So here's the deal.

27:17.958 --> 27:19.041
A seat at the table?

27:20.166 --> 27:22.625
Sure. I'll take this seat
right here.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.166
That's the CEO's chair.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.375
No, it's mine.

27:27.041 --> 27:30.208
"President, Human Resources,
Environment, Corporate Affairs."

27:31.541 --> 27:32.916
We don't have one of those.

27:33.625 --> 27:34.625
You do now.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.250
Those are the terms
of my contract.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.208
I think you'll find
them reasonable.

28:30.666 --> 28:31.666
It's Mum.

28:36.708 --> 28:39.375
I've been gone all night.
If I don't answer, she'll worry.

28:41.875 --> 28:42.875
Mum?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.041
Anna, are you okay?

28:45.250 --> 28:46.250
I'm fine.

28:47.291 --> 28:48.291
Is Whitey with you?

28:49.291 --> 28:50.291
Whitey, no.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.416
Um, I'm at the departure lounge.

28:55.041 --> 28:56.250
Departure lounge?

28:56.916 --> 28:57.916
I'm going home.

28:58.291 --> 28:59.291
Really?

28:59.541 --> 29:00.375
Yep.

29:00.458 --> 29:01.458
Why now?

29:01.833 --> 29:04.073
Mum, I've been wanting to go
home ever since we got here.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.083
Anna...

29:05.166 --> 29:07.326
Plane's boarding. Call you
when I get to Auntie Jean's.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.375
She's a fucking shit liar,
isn't she?

29:14.708 --> 29:16.416
Christ, Jack,
what are we gonna do?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.208
Should leave him to me.

29:40.166 --> 29:41.375
I think she's in a car.

29:42.875 --> 29:43.875
So?

29:48.833 --> 29:49.833
Go.

29:50.916 --> 29:51.916
Why?

29:52.708 --> 29:53.833
You can't stay here.

30:18.375 --> 30:19.583
Steak for breakfast?

30:28.666 --> 30:31.125
You fucking blackmailed
the shit out of them.

30:31.208 --> 30:32.458
Keep your voice down.

30:36.916 --> 30:37.916
What if I don't?

30:40.708 --> 30:41.708
Pardon me?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.875
What if I talk?

30:47.416 --> 30:49.791
If you talk,
we both get arrested.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.458
I got nothing to lose.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.666
You have your liberty to lose.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.833
Yeah, I would be better off
in prison

31:00.916 --> 31:02.791
than going back
to the res right now.

31:02.875 --> 31:04.083
Don't be morbid.

31:04.958 --> 31:07.958
You want me to keep
my mouth shut about Gagnon,

31:08.041 --> 31:12.041
you're gonna pay my community
for the rest of your life.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.916
Your community will be
well taken care of,

31:18.500 --> 31:21.625
but if you ever
threaten me again,

31:22.541 --> 31:24.833
this will be the last bill
I ever pay.

31:26.416 --> 31:28.958
Ask yourself what
I might be prepared to do

31:29.041 --> 31:30.333
to ensure your silence.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.166
We agree we're here
to save Anna, not kill Whitey.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.041
Right, Jack?

32:20.583 --> 32:21.583
Nice one.

32:21.875 --> 32:22.916
Sorry, Jack.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.750
We could leave here,

32:36.625 --> 32:37.625
you and me,

32:38.875 --> 32:40.000
and never come back.

32:42.083 --> 32:43.458
We... We'd always be together.

33:27.458 --> 33:29.083
Fucking hell,
come here, you bastard.

34:00.208 --> 34:01.250
Where would we go?

34:01.833 --> 34:02.958
Anywhere you want.

34:04.291 --> 34:05.666
Anywhere in the whole world.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.333
That's the point, Anna.
We're free.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.330
Do you really think we could
ever get away from here?

34:11.875 --> 34:12.958
What's stopping us?

34:24.958 --> 34:26.041
Anna, get behind me.

34:26.583 --> 34:27.583
Leave us alone.

34:27.833 --> 34:28.958
You have no idea who he is.

34:29.041 --> 34:30.041
I know exactly who he is.

34:33.916 --> 34:35.275
Darling girl,
I'm here to help you.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.708
Both of you.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.250
Now just do what I say.

34:41.333 --> 34:42.333
Or what?

34:42.791 --> 34:43.791
You,

34:45.125 --> 34:46.750
go. Leave.

34:47.541 --> 34:48.375
Run.

34:48.458 --> 34:49.858
I'm not going anywhere
without Anna.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.541
You killed my little boy.

34:59.541 --> 35:01.250
My daughter is not going
anywhere with you.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.500
She's coming with me.

35:03.416 --> 35:05.750
Now, you can stay here
and take your chances with Jack.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.585
Or you can fuck off
while you still have a chance.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.125
Anna!

35:16.000 --> 35:19.208
Whitey, are you all right?
Are you okay?

35:19.750 --> 35:20.875
Anna, don't do this.

35:23.125 --> 35:24.541
Can you, can you walk?

35:25.541 --> 35:27.000
- Yeah.
- Anna, please.

35:31.458 --> 35:32.500
Okay.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.333
Get out of our way.

35:36.791 --> 35:38.083
Jack won't let him get away.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.166
Stop him.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.375
I can't.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.500
Then I will.

35:55.958 --> 35:56.791
You okay?

35:56.875 --> 35:57.750
Anna.

35:57.833 --> 35:58.833
Come on.

36:06.875 --> 36:07.875
Anna.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.583
I've got you.

38:25.708 --> 38:26.708
Where's your gun?

38:35.833 --> 38:36.958
Let him go, Jack.

38:50.250 --> 38:51.708
You got it. Come on.

39:01.125 --> 39:02.125
I've got you.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.291
Come on.

39:26.916 --> 39:29.375
Come on. You got it.
You can do it.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.791
Fuck, I can't.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.375
- I've got to stop.
- No, you can't.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.416
You've gotta keep going.
Come on.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.250
Fuck.

39:43.416 --> 39:44.416
No.

39:45.708 --> 39:47.333
Fuck.

39:47.416 --> 39:48.625
Come on, come on.

39:49.375 --> 39:51.291
Come on. Let's just get...

39:51.375 --> 39:52.583
over there.

39:56.666 --> 39:57.666
Okay.

40:11.083 --> 40:12.166
What do we do now?

40:13.958 --> 40:15.958
I won't let him get you. Okay?

40:16.958 --> 40:18.208
Jesus Christ, Anna.

40:19.708 --> 40:22.041
This is Jack Devlin.
He's a fucking maniac.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.875
He'sHe's still my dad.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.583
Listen, he'll kill you!

40:43.875 --> 40:45.000
Jack Devlin!

40:47.041 --> 40:48.041
Jack.

41:01.541 --> 41:02.375
Put the gun down, Anna.

41:02.458 --> 41:03.583
Stay back.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.235
- What's he told you?
- Everything.

41:15.625 --> 41:16.875
You know, she miscarried.

41:20.958 --> 41:22.041
Whitey's mum.

41:25.791 --> 41:26.791
How could you do that?

41:29.208 --> 41:30.791
How could you do that
to me and Mum?

41:41.916 --> 41:43.125
He killed Pete, love.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.166
He snuck into our house,

41:49.750 --> 41:50.875
ate at our table.

41:51.625 --> 41:53.208
He lied to us, Anna.

41:53.625 --> 41:54.625
He lied to you.

41:54.750 --> 41:55.958
Exactly what Dad did to him.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.291
He's using you, darling.

41:57.375 --> 41:58.458
No, he loves me.

42:04.583 --> 42:05.583
Stay back.

42:06.458 --> 42:08.541
You touch him,
I'll fucking kill you.

42:12.083 --> 42:13.291
She loves me, Jack.

42:25.375 --> 42:26.666
Out you come, Simon.

42:27.083 --> 42:28.123
This'll all be over, mate.

42:28.166 --> 42:29.166
Don't move.

42:30.166 --> 42:31.166
Stay behind me.

42:33.166 --> 42:34.375
Always go on two.

42:35.958 --> 42:36.958
Remember?

42:38.416 --> 42:39.416
Don't fuck this up.

42:54.791 --> 42:56.833
Jack. Jack,
you'll hurt her, Jack.

42:57.416 --> 42:58.750
- Five.
- Jack.

42:59.041 --> 42:59.875
Four.

42:59.958 --> 43:00.958
Fuck!

43:01.750 --> 43:02.750
Three.

43:07.916 --> 43:10.791
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.125
I don't hate you, Jack.

43:23.791 --> 43:24.791
I love you.

43:25.625 --> 43:27.166
I've always loved you.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.583
I love you too, mate.

43:39.833 --> 43:42.625
No! No, no. Whitey, Whitey.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.083
Whitey.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.458
No, no, no.

43:49.208 --> 43:51.166
Dear God.

43:58.208 --> 43:59.208
Jack!
