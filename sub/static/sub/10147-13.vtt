WEBVTT

01:12.323 --> 01:13.699
Okay, hold it.

01:31.634 --> 01:35.388
I suggest you all keep your hands
to yourselves from now on.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.308
Take my word.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.018
It's in everyone's best interest

01:41.143 --> 01:43.813
to have me out of your hair
as quickly as possible.

01:45.398 --> 01:46.399
This is the stuff.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.246
Batman!

03:04.393 --> 03:06.062
Get us out of here!

03:06.604 --> 03:07.646
Move!

03:40.805 --> 03:41.847
Wayne-Powers?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.599
Powers is helping Blight?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.240
What happened?
We heard there was trouble...

03:52.441 --> 03:55.152
If we stick to proper channels
of procurement,

03:55.236 --> 03:57.405
how long will the materials last?

03:57.488 --> 03:58.948
Two weeks, maybe less.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.658
You're burning through
the skin too fast.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.495
And if I may, Mr. Powers,
it's not just the radiation.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.080
Your temper is out of control.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.040
I know, Doctor.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.459
I know.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.586
I'm tired of this.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.093
I can't maintain the charade any longer.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.387
It's time I made new arrangements.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.317
Paxton Powers, polluter!

04:35.526 --> 04:37.504
- Wayne-Powers, go home!
- Paxton Powers, polluter!

04:37.528 --> 04:39.071
Paxton Powers, polluter!

04:39.280 --> 04:40.656
No more sludge in our rivers!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.534
Paxton Powers, polluter!

04:43.742 --> 04:45.536
Paxton Powers, polluter!

04:45.703 --> 04:47.121
Paxton Powers, polluter!

04:47.621 --> 04:49.433
- Paxton Powers, polluter!
- No more pollution.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.625
How do they expect us to make a profit?

04:54.837 --> 04:56.130
He wants to see you.

04:58.174 --> 05:00.176
Oh, now, Father beckons.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.595
Guess I've been in exile long enough.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.865
Let me guess.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.743
You've thought of an even more
demeaning grunt job for me.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.914
Does acting chairman of the board
sound like a grunt job?

05:32.041 --> 05:34.168
How stupid do you think I am?

05:34.668 --> 05:37.338
It's in title only, at least at first.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.132
I'll tell you what I want done
and you'll do it.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.761
If you perform well,
real power will follow.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.804
I need your help, son.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.849
I'm no longer able to face the public.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.977
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.445
Oh, Dad.

06:05.241 --> 06:09.495
Paxton Powers, polluter!

06:09.578 --> 06:11.247
Paxton Powers, polluter!

06:11.330 --> 06:12.957
Paxton Powers, polluter!

06:13.707 --> 06:15.960
All these people are anti-Powers?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.711
Now I don't feel so alone.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.128
Paxton?

06:19.296 --> 06:20.673
Derek Powers' son.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.092
Word is he's being promoted today.

06:23.259 --> 06:26.095
As you can see, not everyone
was happy with him in his last job.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.560
While you're in there, ask Daddy
about his connection to Glow Boy.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.483
I'd love to finally
nail this guy on something.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.689
I'll see if it comes up.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.991
I apologize for the abruptness
of this announcement.

06:47.741 --> 06:52.496
Unfortunately, my health demands
that I take a temporary leave.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.832
Emphasis, I hope, on the temporary.

06:55.332 --> 06:58.127
Therefore, effective
midnight last night,

06:58.335 --> 07:02.047
I've signed full proxy
over my majority stock holdings

07:02.131 --> 07:04.008
to my son, Paxton.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.593
What did he say?

07:05.676 --> 07:06.916
He's putting his son in charge?

07:09.388 --> 07:11.098
- His son.
- Does he know what he's doing?

07:12.516 --> 07:14.143
I trust that you'll grant him

07:14.226 --> 07:16.437
the same respect as you would me.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.563
We must be heard.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.856
The board must know!

07:19.106 --> 07:20.482
I said you can't go in there!

07:20.566 --> 07:22.401
Sefior Powers, members of the board,

07:22.860 --> 07:24.528
we have come all the way from Verdeza.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.696
Please, hear us out.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.198
Get these men out of here!

07:28.407 --> 07:29.867
Dad, your eyes.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.202
Our people are fishermen.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.370
It is our livelihood.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.331
But your son has dumped so much poison

07:35.414 --> 07:36.624
that he has killed our rivers.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.917
- What's going on?
- How did they get in here?

07:39.501 --> 07:40.628
What's this about poison?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.049
I said get rid of them!

07:45.424 --> 07:47.009
Dad, all the people.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.887
This is all that's left.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.898
- Dad!
- Oh, the stench.

08:01.065 --> 08:02.399
This is disgusting.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.872
Good heavens!

08:16.997 --> 08:18.707
- What is he?
- What happened to him?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.004
Whoa!

08:25.381 --> 08:26.632
Powers is Blight.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.724
Is that really Derek Powers?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.651
You animals!

08:47.486 --> 08:49.697
You want to talk about poison?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.659
I am poison.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.703
Let him go.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.707
Old man, I've been waiting
to do this for years.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.006
Powers and Blight, just think.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.134
You're both of my two favorite people.

09:27.443 --> 09:28.444
Dad!

09:49.590 --> 09:50.590
You okay?

09:51.175 --> 09:53.469
I'm fine, Batman.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.610
<i>By surprise,
and stunning the business world.</i>

10:09.735 --> 10:11.987
<i>As the manhunt
for Derek Powers continues,</i>

10:12.237 --> 10:15.199
<i>questions about what he is
and how his transformation occurred</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:16.617
<i>remain unanswered.</i>

10:17.117 --> 10:18.660
You think he was born this way?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.497
Do you remember when Powers
was exposed to nerve gas?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.624
Sure, I remember. I threw it.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.001
Powers would have been
treated with radiation.

10:26.210 --> 10:29.338
That combined with the gas
may have mutated him into this.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.840
You mean, I made him that?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.593
You may have, in part.

10:35.594 --> 10:36.594
Good.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.432
Hey, this guy had my father murdered,

10:40.516 --> 10:42.351
and all he's done since
is hide from the law.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.245
Well, no more hiding
for Mr. Derek Powers.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.396
Now everyone can see what he is.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.982
Even in the dark.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.533
I appreciate the support
of the board, Mr. Larousse.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.868
I won't let the company down.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.995
Excuse me, I have
another call coming in.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.042
<i>Paxton, get my doctors down here!</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:08.293
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

11:08.627 --> 11:10.254
Dad, settle down.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.005
<i>I have to get out of the city.</i>

11:12.089 --> 11:13.757
<i>I need my skin!</i>

11:14.132 --> 11:15.132
Dad, let me talk.

11:15.551 --> 11:19.304
I'll get you help, but putting the skin
back on isn't the answer.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.392
<i>- What</i> are you <i>doing?</i>
- I'm sending an ambulance.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.019
<i>You fool, they'll arrest me!</i>

11:26.353 --> 11:27.938
<i>Now I can't even stay here.</i>

11:28.146 --> 11:29.146
Listen to me.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.316
Now that the truth is out,
let's get help.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.819
Your doctors didn't
have the answer, so...

11:34.570 --> 11:36.822
<i>You've always been a fool.</i>

11:37.281 --> 11:39.199
<i>Now I see I'm on my own!</i>

11:54.381 --> 11:55.757
<i>Any hot spots yet?</i>

11:55.924 --> 11:57.843
A trace here and there,
but nothing fresh.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.153
He might have been on the move earlier,

11:59.177 --> 12:00.446
but now he's holed up somewhere good.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.139
<i>I think I know
another way to find him.</i>

12:02.306 --> 12:03.682
<i>Come back and I'll explain.</i>

12:07.769 --> 12:09.688
Actually, something else just came up.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.815
<i>- What?</i>
- Look out your window.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.567
This one you have to see for yourself.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.668
Next time, use e-mail.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.379
Sorry, but we have to talk.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.217
Paxton Powers.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.644
Please, come inside.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.527
My father's doctors have been
working on this for a while.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.028
It's called a pinch cell.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.698
Turn it on and it sucks up
radiation like a sponge.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.533
<i>- What?</i>
- Look out your window.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.036
I'm having a net built
to connect to this cell.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.997
If you can find my father
and lure him into the net,

13:09.081 --> 13:10.916
the cell can weaken him
enough to hold him.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.043
You want me to catch him for you?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.836
He needs medical attention.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.797
His condition's affected his mind.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.175
There's no reasoning with him,
even if we knew where he was.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.470
I know this is strange asking you,

13:23.720 --> 13:24.972
but from what I hear

13:25.514 --> 13:27.114
you may be the only one
who can find him.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.898
Wayne, you get that?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.942
Powers' own son
wants me to bring him in.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.360
<i>Careful, Terry.</i>

13:38.443 --> 13:40.654
<i>You're sounding a little too vindictive.</i>

13:40.862 --> 13:42.114
What do you mean?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.199
I'm just helping a guy help his dad.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.119
Except in my version,
that help happens behind bars.

13:55.544 --> 13:58.588
Mr. Mendez, how are the fish
biting these days?

13:58.672 --> 14:00.507
That's what I was about to ask you.

14:01.425 --> 14:05.053
Batman's in, but I doubt
he'll cooperate when things hit the fan.

14:05.429 --> 14:06.888
Be ready to kill him too.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.111
Looks like your hunch was right.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.072
How'd you know?

14:24.156 --> 14:27.117
<i>I've been reading people
since before you were a person.</i>

15:05.155 --> 15:07.949
Ah! My pet bat
left us a present.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.263
Ten o'clock.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.313
You don't wanna be here tonight.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.326
- Ahoy, captain.
- Batman.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.377
Where are you? Show yourself!

16:00.544 --> 16:03.213
I found you.
Now it's your turn.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.924
I gotta say, a nuclear sub was smart.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.218
That's why I couldn't find
your radiation trail.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.096
This whole tin can
is still hot with rads.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.973
It's about to get warmer.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.774
Turn right at the next hatch.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.247
Why do you persist in tormenting me?

16:37.581 --> 16:39.708
All I want is to be left alone!

16:40.542 --> 16:42.294
Can't let you run around
like this.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.754
We've got rules about radioactive waste.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.592
And besides, this is personal.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.845
Who are you?

16:55.682 --> 16:56.975
You really wanna know?

16:57.058 --> 16:58.058
Yes.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.938
You killed my father.

17:02.981 --> 17:06.651
Do you have the slightest idea
how little that narrows it down?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.405
Too bad. It's all you get.

17:10.655 --> 17:11.948
Captain on the bridge!

17:16.077 --> 17:17.621
What is this?

17:19.039 --> 17:21.833
Just making up for lost time, Dad.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.336
We never did go fishing together.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.895
Did you really expect me to believe
you'd ever give me power?

17:42.437 --> 17:45.565
That I'd ever have an ounce of control
as long as you were alive?

17:46.107 --> 17:48.068
You taught me by example, Dad.

17:48.443 --> 17:51.321
The only way to get power
is to seize it.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.120
Enough. Turn it off.
That thing's gonna kill him.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.830
You want this as much as I do.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.124
No. I wouldn't have agreed to this.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.435
You said you were gonna help him.

18:04.459 --> 18:05.460
I lied.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.631
[yelpingl

19:05.937 --> 19:07.647
Paxton!

19:08.523 --> 19:10.025
<i>Terry, What's going on in there?</i>

19:10.275 --> 19:11.860
<i>The radiation is off the scale.</i>

19:12.152 --> 19:13.653
I think Powers is going critical.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.946
I've gotta do something.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.454
<i>Get out. Now!</i>

20:07.665 --> 20:09.042
<i>According to his son,</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:11.252
<i>Derek Powers was hiding aboard the sub</i>

20:11.336 --> 20:13.713
<i>when its long dormant reactor
apparently breached.</i>

20:13.922 --> 20:15.465
You made a bad enemy tonight.

20:17.675 --> 20:18.675
What are you gonna do?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.595
Testify against me in that mask?

20:20.804 --> 20:22.597
Oh, I wasn't talking about me.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.182
I'm the least of your worries.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.976
<i>Although divers continue
to inspect the wreckage,</i>

20:27.143 --> 20:29.604
<i>the remains of Derek Powers
have yet to be found.</i>

20:29.938 --> 20:31.689
So he melted with the sub.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.651
Sure, he did.
