00:19.289 --> 00:27.719
hello my name is John farmer. i'm a paranormal
investigator and cryptozoologist. From a very

00:27.719 --> 00:33.610
early age i have experienced numerous encounters
of what people would consider to be paranormal

00:33.610 --> 00:39.690
activity. In this space and time i have witnessed
more than the average person would have in

00:39.690 --> 00:46.890
many lifetimes. I'm no spirit medium or clairvoyant
but i do possess a gift, a gift which allows

00:46.890 --> 00:55.890
me to experience this activity. I've been
possessed 47 times in my life, i've been attacked

00:55.890 --> 01:06.350
by unknown forces, i've seen many unidentified
objects in the sky, all leading to this point.

01:06.350 --> 01:12.310
It is now time for me to share my gift with
you the world, for the first time ever i will

01:12.310 --> 01:17.990
attempt to capture this evidence in a six-part
series as we look into the unknown to prove

01:17.990 --> 01:25.539
there is something in the shadows. What do
you think? huh? about that? Oh yeah it's good

01:25.539 --> 01:30.610
but it's a bit samey though, do you know what
i mean because it was hasn't really changed

09:45.712 --> 09:48.230
How long have you had that ringtone for Steve?

09:48.230 --> 09:49.260

09:53.540 --> 09:55.540
He was sick. He was nearly sick

09:59.780 --> 10:01.780
*Group mumblings*

10:11.549 --> 10:15.841
Okay you ready?
Well, is it alright with that in the background?

10:16.033 --> 10:23.633
yeah yeah, Kirk! There's ducks. Yeah you're
in shot though mate. Have you seen the ducks?

10:23.680 --> 10:30.440
Yes, yeah. Okay.. Good evening you join me
as i stand at the mouth of this huge body

10:30.440 --> 10:38.749
of water. Extending 23 miles its deepest point
is said to be around 800 feet. It is home

10:38.749 --> 10:45.249
to many species of wildlife and huge forests,
and if hundreds of reports are to be believed,

10:45.249 --> 10:50.970
a monster. A monster that's been seen by so
many people that it is famous throughout the

10:50.970 --> 10:57.170
world. Welcome to loch ness. hey come right
up to ya

10:57.170 --> 11:01.569
ducks come straight up to ya, look

11:01.569 --> 11:07.520
it is thought that the monster that dwells
within the lock is a survivor from the jurassic

11:07.520 --> 11:12.850
period or simply a creature that just hasn't
been discovered yet, one thing is for certain

11:12.850 --> 11:18.089
there is plenty of room for it to hide. There
is one other theory which may hold the key

11:18.089 --> 11:24.470
to this and many other mysteries throughout
the world.

11:24.470 --> 11:32.620
Portals. These portals or gateways are said
to be entrances into other dimensions where

11:32.620 --> 11:41.749
creatures can manifest at will. Beings such
as bigfoot, werewolves, aliens, shadowmen

11:41.749 --> 11:46.879
and even ghosts are said to travel through
these portals.

12:01.911 --> 12:07.601
One such portal is said to exist right here
at loch ness, not only the infamous nessie,

12:08.670 --> 12:15.809
but many other strange phenomena have been
witnessed in this area. Ufo sightings, strange

12:15.809 --> 12:22.120
cryptids that roam the vast forests and many
many ghost sightings. On this week's episode

12:22.120 --> 12:26.709
of there's something in the shadows, we'll
be spending three nights deep within the forest

12:26.709 --> 12:28.189
and within the portal.

12:28.189 --> 12:37.559
Was that alright? Yeah sounds good yeah. So
is this episode not about the monster? It's

12:37.559 --> 12:42.653
about the area really, the portal. I mean
how many people have come here looking for

12:42.653 --> 12:48.439
the monster? Loads. We could waste a bit of
time as well. Yeah. Yeah instead of getting

12:48.439 --> 12:55.059
food. We'd just be just be filming the water
for a week. Well , sorry captain kirk's orders.

12:55.059 --> 12:59.158
If you see me pulling my face at you by the
way it's not that i'm judging your performance,

12:59.158 --> 13:03.387
i'm disagreeing with all the bullshit You're
saying. You don't believe me man, you gotta be a believer

13:07.465 --> 13:09.465
*wind howling*

13:25.589 --> 13:27.998
alright? okay?

13:44.640 --> 13:47.740
Wait, wait up

13:50.534 --> 13:52.493
*sings* Jon Farmer

13:59.040 --> 14:08.821
i've never even seen a haggis. John, John,
how big are these woods? Big, vast. We've

14:08.821 --> 14:10.720
been walking for two hours

14:23.201 --> 14:23.955
Scotland!

14:23.955 --> 14:31.420
How are you feeling Daz? Good, we are here,
long journey but we finally made it. What's

14:31.420 --> 14:40.379
up John? Knackered. Long walk mate. long walk?
Yeah but we're nearly there.

14:45.862 --> 14:51.022
Watch out for the wild boars.Bumped into some
local gentleman who told us to watch out for

14:51.720 --> 14:57.425
the wild boars so he knows the territory better
than we do so. There better be more than wild

14:57.425 --> 14:58.425
boars mate

15:00.179 --> 15:06.079
maybe the spirits of wild boars. Yeah well
you never know. What do you reckon Daz? Oh

15:06.079 --> 15:08.394
no no you never know what you find out here
man do you?

15:08.394 --> 15:09.280
You certainly don't

15:09.281 --> 15:11.281
*whispers* Dear

15:15.160 --> 15:16.201
Here are the lads

15:19.553 --> 15:22.069
Nearly at the camp now

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
Alright Fred?
Ayup

15:38.745 --> 15:48.467
Most important thing, chair. John's got his
mosquito net on. Oh man! With his knackered

15:48.467 --> 15:49.782
up chair.

15:58.031 --> 15:59.646
Never goes the right way up does it?

16:04.580 --> 16:10.973
What do you do? just throw it? Take the band
off first. Nobody told me that. Turn your

16:11.322 --> 16:13.085
phone off Steve. *ringtone*

16:20.854 --> 16:28.843
Now that is exactly how i want to sleep. So
Kirk, how's it going? All good mate, just

16:28.843 --> 16:34.870
uh got my emf meter out, just checking if
there's any electromagnetic fields. Okay so

16:34.870 --> 16:40.989
it's in the emf meter yeah? Emf, electromagnetic
meter well as you can see there's nothing

16:40.989 --> 16:48.050
going on right now but I do hope. You know ghosts
come to this realm using electromagnetic fields

16:48.050 --> 16:55.309
so uh as you know, yeah so yeah i mean no
reading yet but there's no electricity about

16:55.309 --> 17:02.970
so yeah no banana. So yeah I'll keep going.
Yeah let us know if there's any change in

17:02.970 --> 17:08.689
that one. Oh i will mate don't you. But i
mean i don't know, get your uh, what they

17:08.689 --> 17:14.554
call again those.. those things you put on
the back? *makes proton pack noise*

17:14.554 --> 17:16.300
Jon boy!
What we doing ?

17:16.300 --> 17:23.125
Bit to camera? Do you want to go over this side?
Yeah go on then. Can I take the mosquito net

17:23.125 --> 17:27.108
off? Yeah, you look like a dinner lady.

17:29.860 --> 17:35.310
So, after several hours trekking through the
very remote forest, we've decided to set up

17:35.310 --> 17:41.050
camp here, right in the heart of where the
paranormal portal is located. We're going

17:41.050 --> 17:45.509
to do a bit of a base check with the emf meter
and then we're going to settle down for the

17:45.509 --> 17:48.320
night.
Cool

17:53.002 --> 17:55.613
Say hello Steve.
Take your mask off mate

18:01.920 --> 18:09.440
Tell us why we've got the masks on Steve. The bloody
midges mate, eaten alive by midges.

18:09.940 --> 18:14.833
Can you see the one in the middle of my head
still? It's gone down a bit. Has it gone down?

18:14.833 --> 18:20.640
it's gone down . You look like a unicorn.
Looks like someones hit you in the head with

18:20.640 --> 18:22.378
a penis.

18:24.230 --> 18:28.385
Did you say he'll grow a third penis?
No, like someone had hit him on the head with one

18:30.366 --> 18:32.366
And that's why we're wearing masks.

18:36.089 --> 18:40.130
Ready? Oh you're already filming?
I'll go again then

18:40.130 --> 18:44.640
Yeah good job there Daz, good job. Wow. Wow
good stuff

18:45.541 --> 18:46.574
Ah man it's raining

18:48.902 --> 18:53.118
That's because you're meditating. Well i'm
trying to. His chins itching.

18:56.551 --> 18:58.551
His chins itching

19:10.519 --> 19:14.580
. You don't look like your meditating, your
getting rained on and your eyes are open.

19:14.580 --> 19:18.415
Looks like your having a poo mate,
like your warming up to drop one out

19:20.368 --> 19:21.760
Mate, I got some wet wipes

19:21.760 --> 19:25.087
Until you've tried it mate don't knock it,
all right? Well you know you keep telling

19:25.087 --> 19:30.164
me that. I'll do it in my tent next time.
It's crap. Is that supposed to be sticking

19:30.164 --> 19:35.804
out like that? No i'm just about to sort it,
that could have gone up my erm.. Story of

19:36.220 --> 19:37.220
his life.

19:37.220 --> 19:48.380
What were you filming then? what was Farmer
doing? Um John was.. he was meditating. Do

19:48.380 --> 19:52.937
you believe in meditating? I believe that
people do it. Yeah. So,

19:54.901 --> 20:00.300
good cheers Fred, thanks for that man that
was really good. How's it going Stevo? I believe

20:00.300 --> 20:05.320
children are the future. Do you think so,
how come? Teach them well and let them lead

20:05.320 --> 20:10.490
the way. That is words of wisdom sir, words
of wisdom. I learned that on the way.

20:10.490 --> 20:16.464
What's this, is this a backing shot or is
it a tracking shot what's it called? A back

20:16.464 --> 20:17.440
shot? I don't know.

20:18.032 --> 20:19.159
John what you're sitting
over there for?

20:19.159 --> 20:20.930
Just forget it.
What you sitting over there for?

20:20.930 --> 20:22.930
Just leave it out

20:23.436 --> 20:25.338
Go on, get on him, go on

20:25.600 --> 20:32.058

20:32.058 --> 20:38.516
up mate? I was meditating wasn't I? We're
only having a laugh. You should try it sometime.

20:40.270 --> 20:41.571
*Kirk mimics electronic noise*

20:42.706 --> 20:46.820
What is this? Can I have a look? I saw you
using this earlier. What's this for? What

20:46.820 --> 20:54.610
do you think it's for? I don't know. EMF mate,
electro magnetic fing. It looks like a ghostbuster

20:54.610 --> 20:59.143
gadget. It is actually. What you're looking
for earlier ?um ghosts obviously, paranormal

20:59.143 --> 21:02.565
activity. Paranormal activity? And there's
uh none over here.

21:03.193 --> 21:05.193
What about this geezer over here

21:05.789 --> 21:07.789
He's not happy is he? he's not a happy bunny

21:07.789 --> 21:14.319
He's not happy. I'm not taking the piss. He's not
going red is he? There you go, he's cheered

21:14.319 --> 21:17.299
up now. Come on then.

21:17.299 --> 21:19.299
Did you push this out when you were doing that meditation?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.210
Come here

21:22.320 --> 21:31.963
Come here..i'll let you teach me how to meditate
okay? Yo Daz. Yo, what's up? Good mate, good.

21:31.963 --> 21:38.280
So what's your role in this little outfit?
My role in this outfit is just to support

21:38.280 --> 21:44.741
my good friend john farmer and um just come
along and help out with the camp really made,

21:44.741 --> 21:50.268
to be fair. Yeah? Yeah, no ghosty stuff for
you? well, i'll go along with it mate, you

21:50.268 --> 21:57.440
know, you know me. So what's your role in
this.. organization ? I'm the one trying to

21:57.440 --> 22:05.360
find the... i think i think i'm here to, like
you say support old farmer and his uh portal

22:05.360 --> 22:10.290
idea and you know i'm behind him all the way
and i'm gonna help him find one I swear. Do

22:10.290 --> 22:14.821
you believe in the existence of a paranormal
portal? Do i believe in existence for paranormal

22:14.821 --> 22:16.760
portal? mate!

22:16.760 --> 22:24.370
Do i believe in the existence of a paranormal
portal?

22:24.370 --> 22:30.410
Yeah I do, thanks mate, yeah it's got a thumbs
up from there. For the record i'm not saying

22:30.410 --> 22:34.630
i don't believe , i'm not saying i don't believe.
Look, i know it is far-fetched right you know

22:34.630 --> 22:40.370
what i mean but, i've never seen one but i
know that the spirally whirly things exist.

22:40.370 --> 22:45.980
And what about the monster? What a scientific
explanation.

22:45.980 --> 22:53.780
That's the best i'd come up with. Do you believe
in the existence? Do i exist in it?do you

22:53.780 --> 22:58.374
believe in the existence? Do I believe in
the loch ness monster? What am I supposed

22:58.374 --> 23:02.255
to say? No i don't even know, i don't I think..
it's a hard question, am i supposed to believe

23:02.255 --> 23:07.125
in it? Just say yes or no. Yeah okay does
it matter? does it matter? Okay uh I'm not,

23:08.304 --> 23:13.604
I'm not, i'm not sure about the loch ness
to be honest um you know what I mean? It's

23:14.870 --> 23:20.110
not really.. not well, because there's no
bones is there? there's no like they get dinosaur

23:20.110 --> 23:25.753
bones and then you know there's never a loch
ness bone found. Oh yeah well they live in

23:25.753 --> 23:32.065
the loch. But it's a lake, that's not the
sea is it? You don't walk around and find

23:32.240 --> 23:34.420
whale bones in the forest.

23:34.420 --> 23:43.780
They live in the sea. Oh in that case then
yeah. Steve! Alright Fred? Talk to me. What

23:43.780 --> 23:49.610
do you want me to say? what do you want me
to do? Well we're talking about the paranormal

23:49.610 --> 23:54.920
paranormal portals what john's looking for,
do you believe in the existence of them? Well,

23:54.920 --> 24:04.530
i follow John to do what he wants to do, open
to either way happening, yeah it's one of

24:04.530 --> 24:09.630
them in it? So you're on the fence with this
one yeah? Oh massively yeah i mean probably

24:09.630 --> 24:15.840
more to not believing but you know i'll go
with me mate, he's got strong views on this

24:15.840 --> 24:18.763
so uh i'm here to support him.

24:21.980 --> 24:29.570
John farmer! Yes? How are you doing? All right.
So do I need to ask if you believe in the

24:29.570 --> 24:33.350
existence of the paranormal portal? You know
I do.Look, you've got to keep an open mind.

24:33.350 --> 24:35.179
Cool. Could be.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.780
You've got to believe, and I believe. I do.

24:44.639 --> 24:46.575
Why are you laughing?

24:46.576 --> 24:47.273
I believe I can

24:47.273 --> 24:51.871
fly. No you can't sing that, he's a nonce.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.152
What are you doing John?
I'm trying to get

24:57.152 --> 25:03.398
all the stuff off it . No you don't need to
ya numpty. Listen, I'm not being funny..Kirk!

25:04.601 --> 25:05.101
Kirk!

25:06.628 --> 25:17.921
i think you should get the emf up here mate.
Okay why? It's gone up three. Right. See.

25:17.921 --> 25:23.561
Okay. What did I say? [ __ ] hell, all right
then mate yep you win. I like aliens, will

25:24.390 --> 25:32.000
be my favorite um horror but sci-fi horror
isn't it? I'd say it was a horror and a sci-fi.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.057
So is that classed as a horror then? Yeah,
like event horizon would be classed as a horror

25:38.057 --> 25:40.000
and a sci-fi

25:45.299 --> 25:52.034
I was absolutely petrified of the exorcist
as a child. As a child? Again i watched it way

25:52.034 --> 25:57.844
too young, my dad would just used to let us
get on with it. Freddy krueger. I watched

25:58.150 --> 26:03.611
Nightmare on elm street when I was six ,yeah
i loved it, i stayed up and watched it. I

26:03.611 --> 26:07.900
used to watch American werewolf in London.

26:07.900 --> 26:13.210
I would watch that every week, yeah it was
mental, i love that. I couldn't watch where

26:13.210 --> 26:18.680
he transformed, it used to freak me out bad
but i was about what was i about 12 13 something

26:18.680 --> 26:23.554
like that so it was mental at that age to
watch that and he used to watch that. The

26:23.554 --> 26:26.400
slaughtered lamb, I've never missed that board.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.731
There's that bat again look.

26:30.731 --> 26:32.480
Where?

26:40.950 --> 26:43.559
No that's behind the tent again

26:45.920 --> 26:49.200
When you're shining the lights through your
eyes you're adjusting to it, you start seeing

26:49.200 --> 26:55.315
stuff don't you? the shadows and things. Oh
yeah. That might be real. There it is again.

26:55.315 --> 27:01.918
What? the bat there look. I think you're messing
the bat up.The bat's like "I don't know where

27:01.918 --> 27:08.459
to go". It's got like, bat blindness. It saying
"I just want to [ __ ] sit down. it's like..

27:08.459 --> 27:09.459
it's gone

27:10.637 --> 27:18.638
Look you have to keep an open mind, anything
can be a sign. Yeah okay. Wow, there's three

27:18.638 --> 27:20.000
bats.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.466
We're in the right place you know.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.520
We are in the right place

27:33.939 --> 27:38.442
oh he's playing hide and seek, but not very
well because he keeps shining the torch on

27:38.442 --> 27:39.466
Why are they rotating around us then?

27:39.466 --> 27:42.625
I was going to say, are they rotating
around this area because it's the center of

27:42.625 --> 27:46.354
the portal? Or maybe they want to suck our
[ __ ] blood

27:46.354 --> 27:47.045
*laughs*

27:47.935 --> 27:53.611
The running mans another good film. What's
with them candles? I was going to put them around the camp

27:53.611 --> 27:55.585
somewhere but I can't be arsed to get up.

27:59.447 --> 28:03.746
*General inaudible chatter*

28:08.986 --> 28:12.040
Ive seen candles work.
If only we had a massive

28:12.040 --> 28:20.640
flame in the middle of the camp. So what in
your opinion, what will be the proof of a

28:20.640 --> 28:27.200
portal? We need to see, we need to see something
happen or we need to see.. So okay let's say

28:27.200 --> 28:32.000
if we saw a ufo would in your opinion would
that would that be just a ufo sighting or

28:32.000 --> 28:39.450
would that be the existence of a portal? I
know what you say.. The portal exists. I can

28:39.450 --> 28:46.060
understand like different areas like say Wiltshire
in england it'd be like hot spots you could

28:46.060 --> 28:51.310
say yeah well that's because it's salisbury
and there's supposed to be a a portal or whatever

28:51.310 --> 28:56.200
there so yeah i can get that, but there's got
to be.. you can't just say um i've just heard

28:56.200 --> 29:00.050
a branch snap, it's definitely a portal. Yeah.
There's got to be something you know what

29:00.050 --> 29:05.820
I mean? Okay a ufo would be exciting but i
don't think that defines it okay for us i

29:05.820 --> 29:14.760
need to see, we want to see something. Paranormal
activity or a creature. Yes i know nothing

29:14.760 --> 29:21.500
about it, tell me about it. Okay so so okay
so there's the things that i've seen but what

29:21.500 --> 29:26.460
about the other hundreds and thousands of
people that have seen the same thing and how

29:26.460 --> 29:31.262
are they all linked how do they all end up
looking like the same the same thing or they've

29:31.262 --> 29:38.360
all heard the same noise or they've all heard
you know. (Steves Ringtone) Explain that,

29:38.360 --> 29:41.760
someone in south america and then someone
say, here.

29:45.280 --> 29:50.221
well i don't know you have to kind of have
to yeah you have to i don't have to research

29:50.221 --> 29:55.467
that. Exactly. But yeah yeah yeah. Fair play
i mean you know prove that it doesn't exist.

29:55.467 --> 30:02.360
Yeah yeah. I can't you know. But do you actually
see a portal or do you just see what come

30:02.360 --> 30:07.400
out? We're in the portal, i don't know where
the the gateway, the actual entrance in or

30:07.400 --> 30:12.060
out is but we are in it that's why the meter
readings are so high here.

30:15.290 --> 30:21.870
The meter readings are high in my house but
i've never seen nothing come out. Well it's

30:21.870 --> 30:30.519
not the same thing is it? At what point do
these things come out? a monster for example.It's

30:30.519 --> 30:35.340
not like monster inc where they just go through
a door and come out it's like they manifest

30:35.340 --> 30:41.280
that they appear through the portal. Yeah.
So they could just come out from over

30:44.762 --> 30:46.762
*sound of rain falling on the tent*

30:51.840 --> 30:52.967
Kirk!

30:58.982 --> 30:59.758
Kirk

31:01.760 --> 31:03.760
Kirk wake up

31:05.274 --> 31:06.445
Kirk!

31:08.429 --> 31:09.322
Wake up

31:12.271 --> 31:13.573
I'm tired man.
I know, shh shh

31:17.976 --> 31:19.889
Mate, I can here some noises

31:21.390 --> 31:23.390
Did you hear that?

31:24.960 --> 31:28.793
You ever heard of a branch falling from a tree?

31:29.361 --> 31:33.807
it was thrown oh just listen

31:53.090 --> 31:54.845
Mate your freaking me out

31:55.417 --> 31:57.351
Go asleep, don't worry about it

32:01.074 --> 32:02.201
*sound of the river*

32:03.803 --> 32:05.934
*fire sound with background conversation*

32:10.318 --> 32:11.799
I need a sleep

32:11.799 --> 32:17.600
All I heard was you snoring.
That wasn't me. It was you. Morning everybody.

32:17.600 --> 32:29.083
Morning! Mr Farmer! Morning mate. Did you
hear them noises last night? What the branches

32:29.083 --> 32:36.144
falling off the tree? I heard somebody snoring
at some point. That was you. I can't hear

32:36.144 --> 32:40.555
myself snore. Come on, you heard it.

32:40.555 --> 32:47.194
I told ya, it was branches falling off the
tress. What noises? what noises? I didn't

32:47.194 --> 32:53.944
hear any noises. Well it's like a stone, something
being thrown to the camp. I mean, it could

32:55.806 --> 32:56.640
Yeah

32:56.640 --> 32:57.636
He means the stuff on the floor

32:57.636 --> 32:58.940
What are they called?

32:58.940 --> 33:00.640
Pine cones.

33:01.513 --> 33:08.343
Okay go. So first night here in the forest
of loch ness and it was pretty eventful.

33:08.410 --> 33:09.303
*background voices*
We love you Jon farmer

33:09.303 --> 33:11.001
Shut up.

33:12.529 --> 33:16.013
Can we do it again? Yeah, quiet we're going
to do this take now.

33:19.330 --> 33:25.922
Right so first night here in the forest of
loch ness and it was pretty eventful. Everyone

33:25.966 --> 33:31.150
heard stones being thrown into the camp by
an unseen force. Unfortunately we were unable

33:31.150 --> 33:39.617
to capture this on camera but let's see what
happens later, overall a promising start

33:43.549 --> 33:46.549
Lovely. Sorted?

33:55.100 --> 34:06.641
It's having a poo, did you see?That's rude,
right in the middle of camp. I'm having a

34:06.641 --> 34:08.000
dump here pal.

34:12.237 --> 34:16.534
Maybe the robin has been used as a vessel
to communicate. Come on

34:17.036 --> 34:19.036
Come on! a robin?

34:22.949 --> 34:30.000
Let's see what Daz is up to? what kind of
scientific paranormal investigation Daz is

34:30.000 --> 34:38.469
conjuring up in his tent. Seems like he's
deep in meditation there, don't want to disturb

34:38.469 --> 34:44.409
it, we don't disturb it. I am though. Yeah
well. I'm only an I.T technician i've been

34:44.409 --> 34:50.580
dragged into this and look, i'm not good at
this stuff, i'm not that you know what i'm

34:50.580 --> 34:58.250
doing but i know that is going up to that,
that's crazy. Yeah. Even for this you know

34:58.250 --> 35:02.690
make sure you cut it so i look like a paranormal
detective. Yeah obviously , i've got to make

35:02.690 --> 35:07.540
this look like a cameraman, i just looked
at the camera and i'm filming up the tree.

35:07.540 --> 35:12.319
Yeah yeah yeah. John Farmer, how's it going?
How's it going? Alright. You getting anything?

35:16.422 --> 35:25.357
I'm sensing a strange static in the air. Okay,
what, what's that then? Can't you feel it?

35:26.972 --> 35:35.557
No. It's like um, it's like when you rub a
balloon on yourself and it you when you bring

35:35.557 --> 35:39.730
it near you can feel like the static coming
off it and i can i'm feeling that everywhere,

35:39.730 --> 35:43.964
and i'm also sensing a spirit. Look this way
John so I can hear you better.

35:44.609 --> 35:45.780
Yeah go on.

35:47.369 --> 35:57.970
I'm also sensing a spirit now whether that's
animal or human i don't know. Well, what's

35:57.970 --> 36:02.960
the difference? Well one's animal and one's
human

36:07.150 --> 36:10.000
Shall i do call out to spirit? Yeah go for
it.

36:18.235 --> 36:21.325
Are there any spirits present?

36:23.900 --> 36:26.109
Anyone wishing to make contact?

36:28.248 --> 36:30.322
We mean no harm?

36:34.905 --> 36:44.000
We're here to make contact, we want proof.
Okay so say that again. We said we've just

36:44.000 --> 36:47.970
heard you're making a noise what are you doing?
We didn't make it seriously. maybe we didn't

36:47.970 --> 36:54.200
make any noises. Oh okay then there's monkeys
in the forest guys, oh-oh, they didn't tell

36:54.200 --> 36:56.080
us about it.

36:56.801 --> 36:58.801
*wooping noises*

36:58.801 --> 37:04.535
All right, maybe it wasn't you. What what
the [ __ ] was that? Someone messing about.

37:04.914 --> 37:06.400
*Steve mimics noise*

37:06.400 --> 37:08.425
Hang on, what?

37:09.664 --> 37:11.664
*wooping noise again*

37:12.640 --> 37:14.640
I told ya

37:15.405 --> 37:16.755
That bloke told us about wild
boars. You still filming this?

37:16.755 --> 37:18.287
Yeah, still filming?
Everyone shhh

37:22.040 --> 37:26.980
So everyone in the camp has just heard a strange
whooping noise coming from the forest. We

37:26.980 --> 37:32.160
did a call out to spirit earlier so i'm guessing
this is a direct response to that, one other

37:32.160 --> 37:37.660
option is sasquatch or bigfoot as it's generally
known they've been known to make these strange

37:37.660 --> 37:42.461
kinds of whooping sounds, it's definitely
something we can look into

37:43.988 --> 37:50.910
Bigfoot? Yeah, what else can it be? Well,
people John. Who's gonna come all the way

37:50.910 --> 37:57.430
out here and make noises like that? Again,
you know, people, i mean whatever it is it's

37:57.430 --> 38:04.052
not bigfoot is it? come on. All right maybe
it is people but you've got to keep an open

38:04.052 --> 38:09.972
mind Fred. I know that but, i mean i can accept
ghosts probably exist, i know ufo's are real

38:10.190 --> 38:17.540
because i've seen one, yeah the Loch Ness
monster maybe but bigfoot? come on. Gorillas

38:17.540 --> 38:19.630
weren't discovered until 1902.

38:23.558 --> 38:31.360
I know, but john , people who see bigfoot
it's just like.. i mean think about it you've

38:31.360 --> 38:36.700
got what, an eight foot or whatever bipedal
monkey man running through the forest you

38:36.700 --> 38:41.870
would have them in museums and bloody zoos
and stuff, there's no way, it just can't happen

38:41.870 --> 38:48.610
can it? Whatever. Okay let's just say that
it's bigfoot. Which it definitly isn't.

38:48.610 --> 38:54.590
Well, what happens now? how do we look for
one? how are you gonna find a bigfoot? We

38:54.590 --> 38:59.240
can try tree knocking. Tree knocking, what's
that? You get a lump one you knock it on a

38:59.240 --> 39:05.060
tree and you wait for a response. John, the
exorcism episode is bad enough, no one's going

39:05.060 --> 39:09.022
to believe this are they? Best thing to do
is crack on with the portal scene, if we hear

39:09.022 --> 39:14.419
anything else we can do whatever. Yeah. Fair
enough, i'm just going to try a tree knocking.

39:15.030 --> 39:20.050
A what? a tree knock, yeah okay. So what's
this then? tell me what this is about. You

39:20.050 --> 39:24.260
knock on the tree, you wait,

39:24.260 --> 39:30.591
and you wait for a response sometimes they
mimic the sound it comes back. Okay

39:36.126 --> 39:38.126
*knocks on the tree, another knock is heard in response close by*

39:39.052 --> 39:41.052
*Laughing*

39:43.231 --> 39:44.489
You all heard it

39:46.392 --> 39:49.522
That fire is wickedly warm.

39:49.522 --> 39:50.872
It's beautiful isn't it?

39:52.160 --> 39:55.063
Thats the thing, you can't order them from the sky can you?

39:55.063 --> 39:59.189
So you've got to fabricate it

40:02.419 --> 40:11.226
The thing is if i'm pretty sure they do exist
but it's making other people believe they

40:11.226 --> 40:15.503
exist (Steves ringtone)

40:15.503 --> 40:21.490
So why would you want to make other people
believe that they exist? Because they probably

40:21.490 --> 40:26.579
do don't they? they do exist. Yeah I mean,
yeah I believe, i've seen a ufo so i know

40:26.579 --> 40:31.769
they exist but me trying to explain to say..
i don't know, somebody doesn't believe in

40:32.380 --> 40:38.140
ufos, what's the purpose for me apart from
you know i mean getting the weight off my

40:38.140 --> 40:43.700
shoulders sort of thing? Prove to all the
skeptics that they do exist. skepticism though,

40:43.700 --> 40:51.240
skeptics, until they see one with their very
own eyes, as in not on a youtube video not

40:51.240 --> 40:55.560
on anything like that because they're never
going to believe it, you could take, there

40:55.560 --> 41:01.011
could be a ufo land here tonight, a load of
aliens come around chase is all off get all

41:01.011 --> 41:07.060
of it on video and you're not going to believe
it, because they'll think it's cgi, puppets,

41:07.060 --> 41:12.833
little people whatever. But if they see something
with their own eyes that they can't explain

41:12.833 --> 41:16.053
that makes it a ufo, but until then you're
never going to convince some people. You know

41:17.406 --> 41:24.930
i don't think it helps with like the way people
have made money off selling alien stuff, i

41:24.930 --> 41:30.780
mean if someone says an alien to you it's
got like a big head and big funny eyes isn't

41:30.780 --> 41:41.004
it? Like Steve? Yeah a bit like Steve. I'm not
green though I think. This is what i mean are

41:41.004 --> 41:43.840
they green? this is what i mean

41:45.681 --> 41:46.617
*whispers*
It's not doing it now

41:49.161 --> 41:51.161
Okay..

41:52.304 --> 41:55.352
So we've just been woken up by footsteps in the camp

41:57.878 --> 42:05.792
really heavy footsteps. It could be one of
the crew but i don't see why they would.

42:11.815 --> 42:15.786
Surely if you want to go for a wee you're going
to go near your tent.

42:16.355 --> 42:18.355
Yeah yeah yeah

42:20.289 --> 42:21.896
Definitely heavy footsteps.

42:21.896 --> 42:23.372
Yeah, really heavy

42:25.420 --> 42:29.035
And we've heard that whooping sound.
That really strange wooping sound again.

42:34.378 --> 42:36.378
It's coming from over there.

42:37.823 --> 42:39.823
Maybe it's Steve messing about

42:42.543 --> 42:43.452
No

42:43.720 --> 42:45.720
I'm going to have a look

43:12.843 --> 43:14.843
Did you hear that?

43:21.019 --> 43:23.019
Could be Fred?

43:25.153 --> 43:27.153
No, he's snoring

43:30.000 --> 43:31.360
Let's turn this off

43:41.050 --> 43:45.586
yeah this they're supposed to repel them but
it seems to make me attract them.

43:45.586 --> 43:47.586
I think they've evolved mate

43:47.903 --> 43:49.903
He's up

43:50.228 --> 43:52.228
Morning!
Cheers Kirk

43:53.675 --> 43:55.675
Morning.
Alright boys?

43:56.687 --> 43:58.076
Hows it going?
Did you go to the toilet last night?

43:58.076 --> 44:00.076
Did I what?
Go to the toilet?

44:00.297 --> 44:01.736
Did I go to the toilet?

44:01.736 --> 44:05.916
what kind of questions are first thing in
the morning? anyway where's this toilet i've

44:05.916 --> 44:09.366
been shitting in the river. you know what i
mean did you go for a pee or anything ?

44:09.366 --> 44:17.152
Did I go for a pee? i don't know yeah probably, why?
What
time i don't know i didn't [ __ ] i know or

44:17.152 --> 44:25.268
twelve maybe, one. Did you do it did you hear
anything? no well the river perhaps. why did you?

44:25.268 --> 44:28.792
yeah footsteps around the camp okay very big
ones.

44:28.792 --> 44:35.840
really big one i heard the footsteps but I also heard that whooping noise again did you

44:35.840 --> 44:40.904
hear that? yeah I did. It was steve pissing about again.

44:41.540 --> 44:43.540
Not necessarily Steve

44:44.268 --> 44:46.268
Farmer!

44:46.607 --> 44:47.952
Oh come on, don't give me that look mate

44:47.952 --> 44:49.297
I'm not having a go at you.
I'm just saying..

44:49.297 --> 44:53.120
If you're setting it up dude,
let us know

44:53.120 --> 44:58.649
he's not setting it up
i swear man. All right then

44:58.649 --> 45:00.000
He's not

45:00.879 --> 45:02.879
Okay so, we heard loud noises then

45:03.191 --> 45:05.191
So, it woke you up as well did it? The footsteps.

45:05.977 --> 45:07.977
No you woke me up with your snoring mate

45:08.328 --> 45:10.328
It sounded like you died forty times in your sleep

45:10.544 --> 45:12.064
He got it on camera

45:12.064 --> 45:14.064
I nearly chocked then *laughter*

45:14.065 --> 45:15.454
Like I say we got it on camera

45:15.454 --> 45:16.533
It was loud anyway

45:16.533 --> 45:17.393
We got it on camera

45:17.393 --> 45:20.000
what, the footsteps?
No, you snoring like a
pig

45:22.096 --> 45:23.212
We can still use it I suppose

45:24.260 --> 45:27.520
This whooping sound then, what did it sound like?
was it the same ones before?

45:27.520 --> 45:29.310
like

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
*mimics noise*
Woop

45:34.360 --> 45:36.360
And what time was that then?

45:36.425 --> 45:38.749
Around about the time you went out

45:39.233 --> 45:40.753
That's why I asked if you'd heard it

45:40.753 --> 45:41.694
Oh, half twelve?

45:41.953 --> 45:43.070
Around about then yeah

45:43.333 --> 45:44.853
I didn't hear nothing mate

45:44.853 --> 45:46.221
I did't make any noises anyway

45:46.221 --> 45:47.478
Well it wasn't me

45:49.617 --> 45:53.263
sounded like you could do on your mobile phone
for example, just amplify it

45:53.797 --> 45:55.797
That's why it's louder

45:55.797 --> 46:00.248
just to scare people for example if you're
making a horror film

46:02.122 --> 46:05.831
i'm just saying. He's not, he's not I swear.

46:06.442 --> 46:08.442
I thought he was as well but last night...

46:08.442 --> 46:14.967
I think Kirks on the payroll. I think your on the payroll
i swear at first i thought it was set up

46:14.967 --> 46:19.825
as well, and i'm like now i'm convinced
we were both in here last night [ __ ] ourselves

46:26.294 --> 46:27.469
okay action

46:32.051 --> 46:40.320
so as you can see our second night in camp
was also pretty eventful. Not only did we hear

46:40.320 --> 46:47.290
the strange whooping sounds again but we also
heard bipedal footsteps around our camp.

46:47.290 --> 46:53.510
It got me thinking of the many reports all over
the world of heavy footsteps outside of tents

46:53.510 --> 46:58.880
often like us in very remote areas

46:58.880 --> 47:07.460
could this be the mythical sasquatch or is
it the mischievous spirits of the forest.

47:07.460 --> 47:12.510
So you're still going with the bigfoot angle
then yeah? yeah why not? i mean we're not going

47:12.510 --> 47:16.960
to see nessie are we and we haven't needed
to exaggerate anything either.

47:16.961 --> 47:19.055
Have you seen Steve?
Um, is he not in his tent?

47:19.055 --> 47:21.753
I've looked all over camp for him mate, his tents empty

47:21.753 --> 47:23.054
He's got my deodorant in his bag

47:23.054 --> 47:24.225
Well he's got be up somewhere

47:24.226 --> 47:27.536
Have you got any deodorant ?
Yeah, I've got a can of spynx.

47:27.893 --> 47:30.591
Can I pinch some?
Yeah.
Spynx.

47:33.924 --> 47:35.593
Your doing a good job there Kirk

47:37.330 --> 47:38.125
Pass that to Steve

47:38.955 --> 47:40.232
where is Steve?

47:42.029 --> 47:43.113
Is he not back yet?

47:44.379 --> 47:45.724
Steve-o

47:46.097 --> 47:47.557
He's probably just gone for a shit

47:47.960 --> 47:49.347
Just give him a call

47:50.206 --> 47:51.398
Here, will you grab that mate?

47:53.193 --> 47:54.846
Is there any more sausages?

47:55.544 --> 47:57.053
when he comes back you can have that i'll
get some more sausages i suppose you can't

47:58.437 --> 48:00.437
I think we need another packet

48:02.053 --> 48:03.442
Is he in his tent, Steve?

48:04.092 --> 48:06.092
I'll put that down here, then when he comes back he can have that.

48:06.092 --> 48:07.433
I'll get some more sausages

48:07.433 --> 48:10.449
I'm surprised he can't smell the food

48:17.769 --> 48:20.573
straight to the answer machine boys

48:22.702 --> 48:23.609
Is it not ringing?

48:26.063 --> 48:30.880
You know what i'm going to do? you know why
he's doing it?
i found the biscuits

48:31.240 --> 48:33.458
Nice.
It's because we're doing that bloody seance today.

48:33.807 --> 48:37.315
He's gone for a walk mate, anything to get out of it.

48:37.780 --> 48:41.068
he's not going to sit around in a circle holding
hands and talking to ghosts is he? it's not

48:41.068 --> 48:44.738
his style. You might as well have that until he comes back.
Has he not done one before?

48:44.738 --> 48:46.738
Steve. Has he not done the seance before?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.917
Didn't he do one at that fricken castle thing?

48:52.212 --> 48:54.212
Oh yeah he did, he got pissed though didnt he?

48:54.598 --> 48:56.598
He doesn't take it seriously.
Yeah yeah

48:59.185 --> 49:01.669
Is that when he drank all them cans first?
Yep

49:06.080 --> 49:08.080
I'm gonna crack another egg

49:10.869 --> 49:12.869
Steve! breakfast

49:15.681 --> 49:20.252
I'm eating your bap, what are you gonna do about it?

49:21.786 --> 49:23.786
*nature sounds*

49:34.072 --> 49:36.072
*wood knocking sounds*

50:06.127 --> 50:19.280
draw upon the energy. So we are gathered here
as a group to respectfully call upon the spirits

50:19.280 --> 50:28.333
of the forest all beings from the earth and
beyond make your presence known to us

50:29.425 --> 50:36.730
we are all part of a universal consciousness
draw upon our energies

50:38.127 --> 50:42.720
there's this robin that keeps coming back
and every time it comes back i get this really

50:42.720 --> 50:48.648
strong reading, it's like mad. So yeah ,there
he is look look at that there's a robin as

50:48.648 --> 50:50.240
soon as he comes back that's going to go mental
i swear

50:51.113 --> 50:57.340
so this is what i meant when i was when i
was saying that about the balloon earlier

50:57.340 --> 51:03.700
on and the static because where we are now
feels like we're on the edge of the portal

51:03.700 --> 51:11.840
i can feel it it's like it's like pressing
back on me it's it's like a force met with

51:11.840 --> 51:17.760
my force and also it's there's normally like
the smell of sulfur and i'm getting quite

51:17.760 --> 51:22.480
an eggy smell and that's generally when a
spirit is present or whether something has

51:22.480 --> 51:24.533
just traveled through the portal

51:26.344 --> 51:29.640
I think this
robin is a spirit, i mean it keeps coming back

51:29.640 --> 51:34.591
to the camp and the reading is really high.
It reminds me of the time when i got possessed

51:34.591 --> 51:40.266
by a Harris hawk. And i don't remember the
possession happening but i remember coming

51:40.266 --> 51:46.960
too and when i did come to i just i was flying
over salisbury the whole i just remember seeing

51:46.960 --> 51:49.690
everything from a bird's-eye view

51:49.690 --> 51:55.900
Well he's left his shoes here, but i reckon
he's got his walking boots. Who?

51:56.499 --> 52:00.352
He's left his shoes here but..I reckon he's got his walking boots

52:00.694 --> 52:01.837
Who? Steve?

52:01.837 --> 52:07.007
Of course. Is he not in his tent now? have you checked?
he's not he's definitely not in his

52:07.007 --> 52:09.542
tent mate, we've checked that, i've tried his phone
i'm just getting straight through to the answer

52:09.542 --> 52:15.860
machine his shoes are there but says he's
got walking boots with him so, if he's gone

52:15.860 --> 52:18.571
the shop and not taken a list off everybody
i'll be pissed

52:19.088 --> 52:20.316
Won't you?

52:21.015 --> 52:23.627
Oh my nose is running like mad, that fire's
kicking off

52:25.721 --> 52:33.170
Right look at that, that is a well-established
tree, it's got hardly any branches so it's

52:33.170 --> 52:36.250
not like it's going to get blown, right? What's
going to do that?

52:38.607 --> 52:44.609
You've got to be at least eight foot tall
and probably 30 stone I say.
You reckon?

52:44.609 --> 52:45.609
how

52:46.493 --> 52:50.279
Do you think we could do it? snap it or break it? or push it down?
Well no but..

52:52.287 --> 52:55.481
look at that that was a well-established tree

52:59.453 --> 53:05.876
Okay so, just come across this in the clearing
it's obviously a deer

53:07.778 --> 53:09.900
Not a great deal left of it, his eye sockets
gone

53:11.559 --> 53:17.467
not a lot, not a lot remains of it

53:17.772 --> 53:20.550
it's got two, it's got one
back leg

53:20.550 --> 53:22.552
two front

53:29.405 --> 53:37.687
Yeah strange, there's only badgers and foxes
really, predators in these woods so that's

53:37.687 --> 53:45.280
pretty pretty unusual just left it the bottom
of this tree line

53:50.891 --> 53:51.951
hmm

53:58.497 --> 54:03.850
we are at the end of our third day in the
forests of loch ness, things are getting very

54:03.850 --> 54:10.860
strange here, not only are we hearing strange
noises in the night but one of our team members

54:10.860 --> 54:17.520
steve has gone missing. The popular theory
in camp is that he's gone for a walk but i

54:17.520 --> 54:25.160
think other things are afoot. He's been gone
all day, he's left his shoes behind and he's

54:25.160 --> 54:32.859
not answering any of his phone calls, whether
this is a coincidence or not he disappeared

54:32.859 --> 54:39.770
on the morning after we heard the heavy footsteps
in the camp and of course the shouting

54:40.599 --> 54:49.034
I have my theories but i'm keeping them to
myself, i just hope and pray that i'm wrong

54:54.948 --> 54:56.948
Hey remember Blackpool last year?
Ha yeah

54:59.510 --> 55:03.050
Set up camp on the friday night what did he
do on the saturday night? found a pub, went

55:03.050 --> 55:08.869
on his own and we never saw him again for
the rest of the weekend. So anybody else mate

55:08.869 --> 55:14.057
yeah, he's gone to the pub mate,
i mean how he's found the pub around here

55:14.057 --> 55:19.950
i don't know but i don't know mate it's Steve isn't it?
He'll turn up, he'll wander into camp

55:19.950 --> 55:22.720
at two o'clock in the morning pissed out of
his face.
Yeah.

55:22.721 --> 55:25.540
I agree mate, it's just um how

55:25.540 --> 55:30.630
you'd structure the episode dispose into it,
whether you interview the kids.
Interview the

55:30.630 --> 55:35.961
kids but maybe get a group of kids who've
had night terrors.
Yeah that are over it.

55:35.961 --> 55:40.738
Or maybe ones that are still having it and especially..
It's best speaking when they're adults really

55:40.738 --> 55:44.837
Best to speak to them when they are adults about when they were children

55:44.837 --> 55:46.051
Do you know what i mean

55:46.051 --> 55:47.284
Maybe and that yeah

55:47.859 --> 55:52.670
Maybe they could like have a kid being filmed
having a night terror and see what happens.

55:52.670 --> 55:54.337
and see if they can pick up anything...
Whats that up there?

55:54.338 --> 55:55.771
What?

55:55.771 --> 56:01.108
Ah, I told ya..it's Steve isn't it, come on.
No way [ __ ] come on

56:01.108 --> 56:04.160
Let's go, he's going to fall in the f*cking river

56:08.006 --> 56:09.613
Wait for me, I've got the light

56:15.768 --> 56:17.768
*Distant voices*

56:20.829 --> 56:22.829
I told ya

56:25.287 --> 56:28.378
Why is he coming through this way?
He's fell over now I bet you, drunk.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.455
Be prepared to find him o the floor pissed up lads

56:43.100 --> 56:45.443
why would he just hide like that?
Because he's a dick

56:45.443 --> 56:46.764
and he does stuff like that

56:46.764 --> 56:47.761
No man, that's weird man

56:48.760 --> 56:52.042
No, we're falling right into his hands
by even talking about this

56:53.002 --> 56:56.145
Alright Steve, we're gonna nick some beers

56:56.835 --> 56:58.835
Yeah, that was great Steve,

56:58.835 --> 57:00.835
Cheers mate, see you later

57:01.605 --> 57:03.058
Very funny

57:04.404 --> 57:06.971
We will see where he went anyway when we look at the camera footage

57:09.705 --> 57:11.705
*background voices*

57:15.849 --> 57:20.857
So, we just witnessed a strange light off over in the woods

57:21.609 --> 57:23.685
At first we thought it might be Steve

57:24.116 --> 57:27.818
but when we went over to the area, the light was nowhere to be seen

57:31.891 --> 57:33.220
He's actually doing a all-day
long joke

57:35.892 --> 57:36.922
He is actually a little bit crazy

57:38.189 --> 57:40.189
No way!! Come and look at this Jon

57:45.108 --> 57:45.930
Hold on..

57:48.730 --> 57:51.517
Right, hang on, back a bit more

57:52.187 --> 57:54.187
See the light?
Hmm

57:54.187 --> 57:56.187
Right, we go running off

57:57.099 --> 57:59.099
Watch watch

57:59.099 --> 58:00.575
Woh!!!

58:00.575 --> 58:02.449
It just fucking disappeared.
What was that?

58:03.108 --> 58:04.073
What? that's mad

58:05.615 --> 58:07.135
They're trying to make contact

58:07.479 --> 58:09.086
What? who are?

58:09.412 --> 58:11.071
I don't know.
It's a spirit light.

58:12.525 --> 58:15.834
It cant be a ufo, is it? it can't be, can it? no

58:17.183 --> 58:19.041
I'll tell you
what that'll look really good on the show

58:22.897 --> 58:24.897
We'll have to back that up you know

58:26.348 --> 58:29.375
That's good, that's good fucking footage mate

58:31.460 --> 58:33.460
I mean...what the hells that?

58:33.897 --> 58:35.897
I am literally speechless right now

58:36.420 --> 58:38.420
You know what?

58:38.520 --> 58:44.982
Whenever anything happens whether it's um
big foots ufos whatever it's nearly always...

58:44.982 --> 58:48.256
Is that on?
that's on

58:48.867 --> 58:50.396
It's nearly always about strange

58:50.396 --> 58:57.595
lights in the sky there's always a light around
at the time, i'm telling you

59:01.260 --> 59:05.986
right, well no.. i mean i can't explain
that if I'm honest but I dont know

59:07.601 --> 59:13.252
We all saw the light. We saw the light
indeed. That's pretty nuts. That is pretty cool

59:13.252 --> 59:18.012
Is that not the sort of prank that steve would
pull on us though?

59:18.012 --> 59:18.820
I don't know

59:18.820 --> 59:21.257
He aint that clever mate.
I know he's a bit thick

59:21.955 --> 59:24.653
It did look very good though, if that was him..

59:25.170 --> 59:27.019
well done steve if that was you mate.

59:27.019 --> 59:30.000
Yeah well done for making an orb just go into the sky and disappear

59:30.000 --> 59:33.089
Come back and take
the credit man because that was ace

59:36.013 --> 59:41.150
That does look very cool and you got
it on camera.
That looked mint

59:41.151 --> 59:42.110
That did look mint

59:42.110 --> 59:45.500
It didn't make a sound though,
there's no noise from it was there?

59:45.500 --> 59:51.020
I didn't hear nothing.So it had gone, it's like it
reacted to us coming towards it

59:51.456 --> 59:54.736
So it was there..it was moving wasn't it?
So we scared it off?

59:54.736 --> 59:57.875
So was it blue? like a blueish light?
I don't know

59:59.490 --> 01:00:05.630
So if it wasn't a ufo then maybe it was a
spirit light? yeah but it was like it reacted

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:10.355
to us coming didn't it? it was like moving
then it was like whoa! what's the difference

01:00:10.355 --> 01:00:13.883
between a spirit light and a ufo? One's a spirit
light and one's a ufo.

01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:17.985
And one's bloody Steve.
Steve!

01:00:18.378 --> 01:00:23.006
What is it? is it a ufo? is it a spirit light?
or is it a mate being a right [ __ ] in the

01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:28.207
bush? I'll tell you what, I'll.. I'll come.. i'll
come a little bit on your side of the fence

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:31.877
here John, if it was Steve and he's heard our
reaction to that he would come over and take

01:00:31.877 --> 01:00:37.997
the credit for it. I will say that much.
He would not be able to stop himself from

01:00:37.997 --> 01:00:44.812
coming over and gloating like that. That would be his final little , what do you call it? cherry on the cake.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:48.760
So i'm i'm i'm a little bit concerned
about Steve boys, i'll be honest because i

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.055
genuinely thought that was him

01:01:06.525 --> 01:01:08.339
What was that?
Did you hear that?

01:01:08.863 --> 01:01:09.863
What is it?

01:01:19.373 --> 01:01:21.373
*whooping sound*

01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:31.836
*louder whooping*

01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:34.233
What the hell?

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:42.248
Shine your torch over there.
What was that?

01:01:42.248 --> 01:01:45.451
Dont shine the torch, put the torch down.
What do you mean?

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:50.000
Okay yeah, let them come out of the dark, nice one

01:02:01.862 --> 01:02:05.974
*Distant wood knocks*

01:02:10.832 --> 01:02:11.953
*Strange vocal sound*

01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:18.792
This is nuts man

01:02:23.694 --> 01:02:25.502
I can't even look

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.415
i've never heard anything like that

01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:37.097
How far away is that? that's pretty far away right?

01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:40.589
Right what we doin? because I'm not staying here

01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:43.935
I'm not staying here either. And that is definitely not Steve

01:02:44.212 --> 01:02:53.880
Right, if Steve is not back first thing in the morning then we go. Mate,
he's had plenty of time to come back, i say

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.811
we go now. Yeah i'm up for it mate. I'm up
for doing that. Yeah i'm going man yeah deffo.

01:02:58.811 --> 01:03:00.200
Now?
Yeah

01:03:00.201 --> 01:03:03.118
Fuck that. Whatever that is, it's got Steve.

01:03:03.582 --> 01:03:05.713
It'll come and get us in a minute so I say we peg it now

01:03:06.598 --> 01:03:09.378
First light mate.
Yes, cool, safe

01:03:09.597 --> 01:03:12.246
Or else we are going to be stumbling in the dark, first light.

01:03:14.516 --> 01:03:23.531
I mean lets look at this,it's obviously someone pissing about but i
mean that's.. that's.. that's something

01:03:23.531 --> 01:03:31.200
else ,that's yeah, there's pissing about
and then.. that's scary do you know what I mean?

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.402
Jon,what do you think man?
I think..

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:41.583
okay i think we get our stuff ready but we
do stay and then go first light.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:45.336
Are we all sleeping in the same tent or something, I mean I'm not...

01:03:45.337 --> 01:03:47.170
I'm not going to sleep tonight mate

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.609
If we all get our stuff together.

01:03:48.609 --> 01:03:55.373
Yeah, don't anybody go wandering around
alone. You reckon? yeah, that's not gonna happen.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:56.883
Definitely not

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:07.413
okay it's 4am and i think a couple of

01:04:07.413 --> 01:04:13.262
the lads have gone to sleep it's been a very

01:04:13.262 --> 01:04:25.949
strange day. Steve still hasn't come back, the
light in the forest and now screaming i do

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:31.752
believe that what we're dealing with here
is paranormal in origin

01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:41.630
the mixture between ufo and potential cryptids
all lead to the portal

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:54.380
Either way, for the safety of our team we're
going to be heading home in the morning

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:58.834
I think we have more than enough evidence on
film.

01:05:03.114 --> 01:05:05.463
The john farmer in me wants to stick

01:05:05.463 --> 01:05:14.059
around, but my gut feeling is telling me to
leave. If this really is a cryptid let's, say..

01:05:14.059 --> 01:05:20.387
sasquatch that we're dealing with here, then
we need to take note of what the first nation

01:05:20.387 --> 01:05:26.989
tribes say, if you come into contact with these
beings you are very unlikely to live to tell

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.709
the tale

01:05:30.339 --> 01:05:37.151
Hundreds of people go missing in national
parks every year, it makes you wonder

01:05:38.932 --> 01:05:42.491
Morning.
Did you hear anything else last night?

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.320
No, nothing thank God

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.324
Daz? You hear anything else?

01:05:48.797 --> 01:05:50.000
No mate

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
What's that?
Leaving a note for Steve

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.875
For if he decides to show up.
Good idea

01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:57.050
Tell him he's a dick.
I have done, he is a dick.

01:06:00.996 --> 01:06:02.996
I thought it could have been the locals though

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:09.738
But i've never heard anything like that ever,
like it could have been an animal or some

01:06:09.738 --> 01:06:11.174
creature or..

01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:23.005
I don't know mate, i mean you gotta look at it
this way i mean locals i mean what locals?

01:06:23.005 --> 01:06:26.637
how many people have we seen when we've been
here? nobody, we haven't seen anybody there's

01:06:26.637 --> 01:06:32.982
no locals around here. I thought it could have
been jon setting it up but...look at him.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.240
Yeah.
That's not Jon is it?

01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.491
We gonna sort these tents out or what?

01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:40.229
We need to get fucking out of here mate

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.229
Forget the tents.
He'd be persuading us to stay.

01:06:42.229 --> 01:06:44.229
What, we're leaving the tents here?
We are leaving the tents here

01:06:44.229 --> 01:06:46.229
Let's get the hell out of here, we can come back for them.

01:06:46.229 --> 01:06:49.495
Well we've got to take our stuff obviously.
We'll take our stuff, just travel light.

01:06:53.109 --> 01:07:00.840
So our first time here at loch ness has come
to a close.. come to a close? End. And so our first

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.980
time here at loch ness has come to an end
with a few nights of strange happenings increasing

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:12.950
in intensity, we've decided that the safety
of our team has to be a priority. Ufos, strange

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:22.250
beasts wandering the night and the unholy
screams one thing is for sure loch ness has

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:30.932
many more mysteries to be solved. I'm john
farmer john join me next time on there's something

01:07:30.932 --> 01:07:32.562
in the shadows

01:07:36.796 --> 01:07:38.674
Wait, wait up

01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:45.633
*Walking through the bush sounds*

01:07:51.419 --> 01:07:55.725
Kirk! slow down man, slow down

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.210

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:13.748
Can you hear that?

01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:16.250
It's a person

01:08:16.639 --> 01:08:18.862
Mate that's Steve.
Steve?

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.229
I'll give him a call.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.760
*Distant ringtone*

01:08:28.992 --> 01:08:30.992
It's ringing!
No!

01:08:30.992 --> 01:08:32.992

*excited laughter*

01:08:32.992 --> 01:08:34.992
I knew it.
Shh, be quiet

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.888
We'll sneak up on him.

01:08:43.068 --> 01:08:45.068
*Steves ringtone getting louder*

01:08:59.648 --> 01:09:00.978
Are you ringing him?

01:09:03.933 --> 01:09:05.933
It's coming from up there.

01:09:09.317 --> 01:09:11.017

01:09:17.522 --> 01:09:19.522

01:09:20.801 --> 01:09:22.801

01:10:12.837 --> 01:10:14.837

either wait for them or we can get out

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:49.130

out and then someone can come back and look

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:53.420
for the pair of them.I agree with that. What
are you putting a [ __ ] gopro on for? because

What the hell?
Well we definitely didn't come this way.

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.733
You got any water?

01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:42.931
It's not my fault ive been walking for an hour

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:44.650
Well it's not my fault either is it?

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:46.650
Chill out, come on.

01:12:50.559 --> 01:12:51.188
Where you going?

01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:55.664
I'm just gonna have a look over here, see if
we can find a way off this

01:13:06.502 --> 01:13:08.502
Fred we need to keep moving mate

01:13:08.502 --> 01:13:10.895
Lets get a move on guys. Hang on, before we go any further,

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.855
can I at least just check?
Well check it then

01:13:14.511 --> 01:13:16.614
I'll just get the compass out.
What do you need that for?

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.393
Make sure we're still going south.
Navigation has got us to the side of a cliff boys.

01:13:28.349 --> 01:13:30.327
oh we got a problem here

01:13:30.763 --> 01:13:34.116
The compass isn't moving.
Yeah exactly it's not moving

01:13:34.116 --> 01:13:35.287
Well what does that mean?

01:13:35.287 --> 01:13:37.362
Why is it not moving? how is that possible? Ive got no idea

01:13:37.362 --> 01:13:38.303
That, hold on...

01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:41.040
that's the electromagnetic field

01:13:42.373 --> 01:13:46.844
Wheres the emf metre?
Compasses don't just break. Get your toys out mate,

01:13:46.844 --> 01:13:51.739
great time to play with your toys, brilliant. Well
we've got to check haven't we? see if the compasses broke.

01:13:51.739 --> 01:13:55.397
what are you checking for? It's gonna take
two seconds, give me that give me that meter

01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:02.080
Look at that.
So..so what's that mean?
It's going absolutely mental.

01:14:02.861 --> 01:14:07.020
Well in a supernatural
sense it means..It means we have to go come on let's

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:12.090
go. I'm calling the police again boys.
Good luck with that. We got to keep heading south.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:16.040
well that's the direction we've been going for an
hour, we don't know. If we just look like we're

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.691
going in a straight line the compass is not
working we can't go to the compass

01:14:18.691 --> 01:14:19.520
anymore

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520
Let's just keep going.
Brilliant plan.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.320
I'm going to turn this off

01:14:27.376 --> 01:14:29.376
*Distant tree knocking*

01:14:41.639 --> 01:14:45.920
If you are tracking our last location, we have moved away.
Good luck with that.

01:14:46.324 --> 01:14:48.654
If the compass is on south how will they track our location?

01:14:48.654 --> 01:14:51.693
it's gps , I told you before.
Yeah but it's not going to work is it.
We need to keep moving.

01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:53.645
I lost signal

01:14:59.463 --> 01:15:03.284
If you want to tell us what this is in the
woods you just go ahead and do it will ya?

01:15:03.284 --> 01:15:06.878
It's obviously, come on, it's obviously not
john is it? now come on. I''m here aren't I?

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.920
You know ive rung the police don't you?you'll have to explain this to them.

01:15:12.237 --> 01:15:19.264
Daz, which way are we going? Daz!
I haven't got a signal dont follow me

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.358
If we keep going in this direction we've got
to come to a road or something, surely.

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:34.348
Why aren't we getting anywhere? i swear we've walked
past these trees half an hour ago. We must

01:15:34.348 --> 01:15:41.396
be coming up on a road soon. Put your camera
away mate and check that we're not going around

01:15:41.396 --> 01:15:44.754
in circles. I told you what I'm doing, i'm trying
to record on so i'm trying to get whatever

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:52.239
i can if, someone's messing about i want to
get it on camera. Starting to go dark boys,

01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:54.477
i'm not spending another night out here

01:15:56.309 --> 01:16:03.330
Help! Jon, we've tried that one we've tried that
haven't we, it's obviously.. It's not going to do any

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:05.326

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:14.840
gprs signal we were miles away from where
we are. Nobody's coming jesus [ __ ] christ

that bigfoot [ __ ] john we all know that

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:24.600
there's some nutter walking around, running
around in the woods because you hired them,

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:30.120
as part of your little film. Don't you think
if i had i would have said something by now?

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.389

take a professional actor to do that mate.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:57.501
People going missing, the blood, the stuff hanging
in the tree. Yeah how do we know that that

01:17:57.501 --> 01:18:01.910
was Steve? it was so conveniently placed high up in the tree so that we couldn't

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:07.860
inspect the body. Well I can't explain it. Nice! I can't explain
it. [ __ ] you. [ __ ] you! Come on, we gotta

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.800

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:22.405
Well your gonna have to try aren't you? Give me that stick.

01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:28.952
You can't stay here can you with whatever is out there?

01:18:29.764 --> 01:18:32.375
I'd rather stay here than be with fucking him

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.950
Well he's stressed isn't he?
Arnt we all?

01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:38.874
Yeah I know but you cant just stay here can you?

01:18:40.436 --> 01:18:42.785
I want to get out as well, so.
This aint gonna work.

01:18:43.109 --> 01:18:45.284
It is, just don't put all your weight on it.

01:18:45.284 --> 01:18:47.284
It'll take forever, it's going to get dark.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.669
Alright Jon?
The sticks [ __ ] useless man, I might as well just hop.

01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:56.014
Well it's helping you to walk isn't it?

01:18:56.014 --> 01:18:57.600
Sorry mate, I'll find you a crutch.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.731
Something with a bit sticking out at least

01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:07.360
It's going dark man.
Daz, slow down mate.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.360
What?
Nothing.

01:19:16.276 --> 01:19:19.806
We need to get somewhere higher up, at least we can
see where we are then.

01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:22.112
Where?

01:19:22.639 --> 01:19:24.032
Where's higher?

01:19:26.434 --> 01:19:28.434
I don't know

01:19:37.165 --> 01:19:39.165
Fucks sake

01:19:48.923 --> 01:19:50.443
You alright Jon?
Yeah.

01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:52.321
Dandy

01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:59.725
See any roads? No. Nothing at all? No

01:20:02.343 --> 01:20:04.343
There's a mountain over there

01:20:06.393 --> 01:20:13.626
That's not the one we came in on is it? the
mountain? No, no, because..I cant see nothing

01:20:13.626 --> 01:20:16.077
there's no roads, are you sure we haven't been here before
in fact?

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.393
We better keep moving

01:20:25.523 --> 01:20:27.523
The suns going down, that's it

01:20:28.148 --> 01:20:30.541
This is utter bollocks.
I'm not walking around there at night.

01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.930
Or limping around there at night

01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:39.189
We can't go this way now can we? look at it,
just dense forest. nothing anywhere. And i can't

01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:40.189
get down there.

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:58.812
So it's 1am, we've had to pitch a tent ,we're
still lost and we don't want to be running

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:02.956
around in the woods with whatever it is that's
out there

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:11.152
We haven't had a fire and we're trying to
be really quiet because we don't want to attract

01:21:11.152 --> 01:21:20.623
any attention to ourselves. We've got no battery
left on our phones, which isn't great but as

01:21:20.623 --> 01:21:22.782
soon as the sun comes up

01:21:24.527 --> 01:21:28.934
we're gonna head in the same direction and we are
gonna find a way out of these woods

01:21:32.276 --> 01:21:34.276
Right, I'll turn it off.
Yeah

01:21:42.199 --> 01:21:44.199
*Loud screaming from the forest*

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.199
Shit!
What the flipping heck was that?

01:21:46.199 --> 01:21:48.199
Shh, keep it down man

01:21:53.582 --> 01:21:55.582
*loud screaming*

01:21:56.616 --> 01:21:57.830
Quiet

01:22:08.118 --> 01:22:10.118
What the heck? what's that?

01:22:14.123 --> 01:22:16.123
Oh my God
Jesus

01:22:22.206 --> 01:22:24.206
Come on, go

01:22:33.393 --> 01:22:35.393
Which way? down here

01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:51.070
*snapping and choking sound*

01:22:55.969 --> 01:22:58.624
Woh woh, what was that?

01:22:59.577 --> 01:23:02.276
Fred? Freddie?

01:23:04.165 --> 01:23:05.670
where is he? Fred Fred.

01:23:08.812 --> 01:23:11.023

01:23:11.983 --> 01:23:13.588
Mate is that?

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.588
Can you see? Is that Fred?

01:23:15.588 --> 01:23:16.977
Let's get out of here

01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:18.421
Go go go go go

01:23:25.983 --> 01:23:27.983
*Branches snapping*

01:23:30.246 --> 01:23:32.246
Jesus! Fucking hell

01:23:38.761 --> 01:23:40.761
*Heavy breathing*

01:23:44.393 --> 01:23:46.393
Daz?

01:23:48.794 --> 01:23:50.794
Oh fuck

01:23:53.682 --> 01:23:54.634
I can't see

01:24:19.252 --> 01:24:20.117
I can't look

01:24:24.608 --> 01:24:25.779

01:24:30.387 --> 01:24:32.387
Daz?

01:24:45.112 --> 01:24:47.112
*Heavy breathing, panic sounds*

01:25:49.012 --> 01:25:51.012
*Loud screaming*

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:24.646
This is a message for

01:26:26.434 --> 01:26:29.239

01:26:34.241 --> 01:26:36.241
*Loud grunting sounds close by*

01:26:58.552 --> 01:27:00.552
*Loud screams all around*

01:27:25.495 --> 01:27:27.955
i don't think i'm gonna make it out of this forest alive.

01:27:32.887 --> 01:27:34.316

I can't run anymore, i feel like my whole
body is shutting down

01:28:21.103 --> 01:28:23.893
There are creatures in these woods

01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:32.248
intelligent creatures that must be destroyed

01:28:38.010 --> 01:28:38.989

*screaming and grunting sounds all around*

01:29:48.568 --> 01:29:50.568
*Heavy footsteps*

01:29:56.121 --> 01:29:58.121
*Jon screaming*

01:30:27.273 --> 01:30:29.273
