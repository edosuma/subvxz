WEBVTT

00:01.622 --> 00:02.539
- They're good?
- Yeah.

00:02.664 --> 00:03.707
Okay, that one right there.
Corner.

00:03.832 --> 00:05.175
- Couch.
- Whoo!

00:05.300 --> 00:06.299
- Whoo! That one's good.
- Yeah? Good?

00:06.465 --> 00:07.675
All right, we're on a roll.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.844
- Blake's back. Welcome home.
- Whoo! All right.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.816
Check it out, man, almost done
acid-proofing the house.

00:12.941 --> 00:14.640
Oh, you saved me a corner,
though, right?

00:14.806 --> 00:16.053
Yeah, dude, we're in this together.

00:16.178 --> 00:17.309
Hit it.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.722
This guy right here?
All right.

00:19.881 --> 00:22.860
Aah!!

00:22.985 --> 00:24.995
Ow, man, that's not ready yet.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.861
Ders, let's be "profesh" here, okay?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.737
I doubled down... I guess
I'll have to triple down.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.365
I'm excited about
this acid, though, dude.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.170
My buddy did acid once,

00:33.295 --> 00:35.506
and he immediately
could speak Cantonese.

00:35.631 --> 00:37.241
It's like,

00:37.366 --> 00:38.675
Before we get into that, though,

00:38.800 --> 00:40.110
we got that surprise.

00:40.235 --> 00:41.411
You ready for this?
Check it out.

00:41.536 --> 00:44.515
A little bit of hype Williams...

00:44.640 --> 00:46.964
Whoa!

00:47.130 --> 00:49.008
Oh, my gosh, guys, this is great.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.787
But I have a little surprise for you.

00:50.912 --> 00:52.022
Check it out.

00:52.147 --> 00:54.291
Perimeter shock collars.

00:54.416 --> 00:57.127
Yeah, so if you leave the house,
you're gonna get shocked.

00:57.252 --> 00:58.893
'cause the house is acid-proof,

00:59.059 --> 01:00.130
but the world...

01:00.255 --> 01:02.187
Is not acid-proof.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.940
So true.

01:04.159 --> 01:06.734
- Hit me!
- Yo, big boy.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.105
I can't see.
It's in the dark.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

01:15.504 --> 01:19.550
Well, that was an "acid-ent"
waiting to happen.

01:21.009 --> 01:22.291
I'll get the broom.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.667
- Ooh, snug as a bug.
- Oh, yeah.

01:36.792 --> 01:37.668
Check it out, dude.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.836
This is my God station.

01:39.961 --> 01:41.972
C-double-o-d, God.

01:42.097 --> 01:43.812
- Very Latino.
- That spelled "good."

01:43.978 --> 01:45.075
Yeah, I heard, when people trip,

01:45.200 --> 01:46.231
they, like, talk to God or whatever.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.145
Wonder if God's a chick, dude.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.846
- Big ol' titties!
- Yeah!

01:49.971 --> 01:51.445
Big ol' God titties!

01:51.611 --> 01:52.466
- Blah.
- Yeah.

01:52.591 --> 01:54.351
Like, ones that you must respect.

01:54.476 --> 01:56.620
- Absolutely.
- Also made a list of questions

01:56.745 --> 01:58.255
she's probably gonna want to ask me.

01:58.380 --> 01:59.923
Well, Adam, how many girls
have you slept with?

02:00.048 --> 02:02.693
Whoa!
You think you're God, bro?

02:02.818 --> 02:04.294
- Huh?
- You're not God, bro!

02:04.419 --> 02:06.460
- You can't ask me that.
- Sorry.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.628
I've had sex with five.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.967
Just kidding.
100, right?

02:10.092 --> 02:11.772
Five.

02:11.897 --> 02:13.437
Yeah, I'm just trying
to see something

02:13.562 --> 02:16.888
way more real than God,
like... a dragon.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.508
That'd be sweet.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.510
Oh, that's blasphemous.
I'm sorry.

02:20.635 --> 02:22.018
Oh! Hey, Ders, bud!

02:22.184 --> 02:23.347
Here's your collar.

02:23.472 --> 02:24.437
No can do, guys.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.816
Alice just buzzed my celly

02:25.941 --> 02:27.517
and wants me to join her
in West Covina

02:27.642 --> 02:29.052
for a business convention.

02:29.177 --> 02:31.188
Then you explain to her
that you can't,

02:31.313 --> 02:33.290
because you're doing acid
with us, right?

02:33.415 --> 02:35.030
We're doing drugs, we're doing
a lot of drugs together.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.360
Guys... come on.

02:36.485 --> 02:37.828
This is kind of a big deal for me.

02:37.953 --> 02:39.529
It's my first business trip, right?

02:39.654 --> 02:41.578
I'm like Steve Martin
in that John candy movie.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.733
I thought you wanted
to be like Steve jobs

02:42.858 --> 02:44.289
and do a bunch of acid with us.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.203
Steve jobs, right?
Created apple.

02:46.328 --> 02:47.404
Great company.

02:47.529 --> 02:49.039
But then he left and created Pixar,

02:49.164 --> 02:50.407
which is way better,
then he came back to apple,

02:50.532 --> 02:51.908
made that way better.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.744
We got iPads, iPhones,
all sorts of stuff.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.545
Let me go create my Pixar.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.803
Then'll come back and we'll
drop iPhones, okay?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.317
I have no idea what
any of that stuff meant.

03:00.442 --> 03:01.640
- No.
- Am I Pixar?

03:01.806 --> 03:03.487
We are doing acid together, dude!

03:07.729 --> 03:09.773
Oh! Oh, God!

03:09.939 --> 03:11.328
- Okay, help me out.
- Okay, get this off.

03:11.453 --> 03:12.234
- Help me out.
- Okay.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.235
Wish me luck!

03:13.455 --> 03:14.931
We are doing acid together

03:15.056 --> 03:17.656
as a friendship family, Ders!

03:25.233 --> 03:27.477
Take that thing off now.

03:27.602 --> 03:29.246
What? Take...

03:29.371 --> 03:30.814
Oh. This thing?

03:30.939 --> 03:32.149
Sorry.
Forgot about it.

03:32.274 --> 03:33.250
It's so comfortable, you know?

03:33.375 --> 03:34.518
Hammacher Schlemmer.

03:34.643 --> 03:37.587
Also, I got, uh...
Gojo.

03:37.712 --> 03:39.256
You wanna borrow it
for the ride home, let me know.

03:39.381 --> 03:41.556
You just put it on here,
and then you're hands-free.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.860
See what I mean?
Drivin'... I'm drivin'.

03:43.985 --> 03:45.629
Take a call.
Still drivin'.

03:45.754 --> 03:47.186
You can go off-road with it.

03:47.422 --> 03:48.854
Little kayaking.
Doesn't matter.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.002
There's a video online about it.

03:52.127 --> 03:54.104
What are those?

03:54.229 --> 03:56.070
What are... oh, these?

03:56.331 --> 03:57.905
Check it out.
Telamericorp pens.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.433
Pretty cool, right?

04:02.971 --> 04:04.881
[Bleep] your pens.

04:05.006 --> 04:07.684
This is about one thing...

04:07.809 --> 04:10.053
Her.

04:10.178 --> 04:12.044
Gale Reynolds...

04:12.210 --> 04:14.558
A.K.A. "The Barracuda."

04:14.683 --> 04:16.625
Cloud mall, director of sales.

04:16.750 --> 04:20.511
And she's got the power
to bring us out of the red.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.090
We made it
to the big leagues, my man.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.162
Happy business trip!

04:34.122 --> 04:35.399
How'd we beat you here, man?

04:35.524 --> 04:37.694
We got fireworks.
Pretty cool, right?

04:37.860 --> 04:40.114
Guys, this is a no!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.304
Hey, shh.
On the phone here.

04:41.429 --> 04:42.532
Yes, hi.
Is the ice still free?

04:42.698 --> 04:46.510
It is? Great.
Okay, Mahalo.

04:46.635 --> 04:49.346
Ice.
Currency of the future.

04:49.471 --> 04:50.447
I'm gonna be rich.

04:50.572 --> 04:52.582
No, no, no!

04:52.707 --> 04:53.961
You guys need to leave.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.686
- Right now!
- All right, Ders.

04:55.811 --> 04:57.354
Chill out, we're not gonna
mess this up for you.

04:57.479 --> 04:59.823
Go down there,
kiss a few business butts.

04:59.948 --> 05:02.826
And then come back and nuke your mind

05:02.951 --> 05:05.055
into nacho cheese.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.030
All right, cool.
Like, so I go,

05:07.155 --> 05:09.685
I kiss the business butts,
and then we'll do all sorts of...

05:09.851 --> 05:11.228
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.869
- Hey, give that back.
- No.

05:12.994 --> 05:14.337
- Dude, give it back.
- No.

05:14.462 --> 05:15.816
- Hey, give us that!
- No.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.541
- What the...
- Hey!

05:17.666 --> 05:19.236
- That was harassment.
- Okay.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.544
- Okay, you put it in a safe...
- Sorry.

05:20.669 --> 05:21.645
Like I can't open safes...

05:21.770 --> 05:23.213
- Oh.
- With my muscles.

05:23.338 --> 05:24.741
Ders, give us the acid.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.993
Come here!

05:27.108 --> 05:28.518
What is this?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.665
- Oh...
- Just sit down.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.725
Enjoy the porno.

05:33.850 --> 05:35.586
There's probably beer
in the mini fridge.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.394
Enjo- shh! Shut up.

05:37.519 --> 05:39.298
- What is she moaning?
- I missed it.

05:39.688 --> 05:41.091
What did she moan?

05:41.257 --> 05:43.200
"I want you to eat my pudding?"

05:43.325 --> 05:45.402
That doesn't make sense.

05:45.527 --> 05:47.504
- Oh, yeah.
- Pussy.

05:47.629 --> 05:49.372
- Ah.
- Yeah, that makes a lot... yeah.

05:49.497 --> 05:51.352
- Yep, that's what's happening.
- Yep, mm-hmm.

05:53.268 --> 05:54.711
Hey. She here yet?

05:54.836 --> 05:56.546
Yeah, she just got cornered

05:56.671 --> 05:59.579
by a couple of real knuckle draggers.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.475
All right, once they leave,
we'll make our move, and...

06:02.069 --> 06:04.087
Oh, damn it.

06:04.212 --> 06:05.889
- Who's that?
- Don Walters...

06:06.014 --> 06:08.285
A.K.A. "Psycho D."

06:08.451 --> 06:09.893
He's the savage who stole
The Barracuda from us

06:10.018 --> 06:11.414
five years ago.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.763
Wait, what's your nickname?

06:12.888 --> 06:15.376
- I don't have one.
- How come?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.267
Because no one ever gave me one.

06:17.392 --> 06:19.379
All right, let's get over there
before they get too comfortable.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.537
- All right?
- Wait, no, no.

06:20.662 --> 06:21.882
I gotta go get my stat binder.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.094
You know, stat cat Ders
has gotta be ready to pounce.

06:24.219 --> 06:25.616
Okay, well, Ders,
I hate to break this to you,

06:25.741 --> 06:27.411
but I did not bring you here to talk.

06:27.536 --> 06:30.098
OK?
I brought you here to look cute

06:30.264 --> 06:31.414
and to get her drunk.

06:31.539 --> 06:34.102
Right?

06:34.268 --> 06:35.118
Wait, what?

06:35.243 --> 06:36.119
I'm serious.

06:36.244 --> 06:37.481
Look. Look at Psycho D.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.356
Okay, every year, he wines 'em,

06:39.481 --> 06:40.590
he dines 'em.

06:40.715 --> 06:42.027
And then they always fall for it.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.960
I mean, you do the math.

06:44.085 --> 06:47.063
He's 69s them.

06:47.188 --> 06:48.231
- No.
- I'm just...

06:48.356 --> 06:49.966
No. No.
He seals the deal.

06:50.091 --> 06:51.201
Oh, okay.
All right.

06:51.326 --> 06:52.454
Well, if it's about partying,

06:52.620 --> 06:54.104
then I should have brought
Blake and Adam.

06:54.229 --> 06:55.305
Those guys are like animal...

06:55.430 --> 06:56.640
Oh, God, could you imagine

06:56.765 --> 06:57.808
what the dumb [bleep] would be doing

06:57.933 --> 06:59.252
if they were here right now?

06:59.418 --> 07:01.311
- Oh, good.
- Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire.

07:01.436 --> 07:02.673
Fire, fire, fire!

07:02.839 --> 07:05.148
Oh, yeah. Burn it.
Ohh.

07:05.273 --> 07:07.803
Oh, I'm cuttin' through.
I'm gonna cut through.

07:09.711 --> 07:10.821
- Gayle.
- Ah!

07:10.946 --> 07:12.122
Ooh! Hi.
Um, uh...

07:12.247 --> 07:14.991
Alice Murphy from Telamericorp.

07:15.116 --> 07:17.771
Alex. Temericorp.
So cool. Hi.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.630
It's Alice.
From Telamericorp.

07:20.755 --> 07:22.899
Yeah. So, um, so hi.

07:23.024 --> 07:26.488
It's, uh, it's been
a long time, hasn't it?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.032
I don't know.
You tell me.

07:30.265 --> 07:31.341
She's funny.

07:31.466 --> 07:32.453
Yeah.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.496
So, uh, how's business been?

07:34.662 --> 07:35.812
Mm-mm...

07:35.937 --> 07:38.014
- You need to stop talking.
- Ow.

07:38.139 --> 07:39.710
I just came here to have a little fun

07:39.876 --> 07:42.185
so unless you're rockin' and rollin',

07:42.310 --> 07:44.006
I'm-a be strollin'.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.755
No, you don't need to stroll,

07:45.880 --> 07:47.885
because I am rock and he is roll.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.759
And that's why I would
like to introduce you

07:49.884 --> 07:53.129
to my Anders, who is... he is, uh...

07:53.254 --> 07:54.598
I'm a good time waitin' to happen.

07:54.723 --> 07:56.132
- Wow.
- So let's look at this menu.

07:56.257 --> 07:58.001
You know, and decide whether
we're gonna get

07:58.126 --> 07:59.563
a stout night out.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.799
Or are we gonna
get frisky with the whisky?

08:01.924 --> 08:02.851
I don't know my Anders.

08:02.976 --> 08:04.441
Hot oatmeal.
Um...

08:04.566 --> 08:06.610
- Yeah, hold on. Don!
- They're serving breakfast.

08:06.735 --> 08:07.696
What are you doing?
Where you going?

08:07.862 --> 08:08.945
Are you leaving?

08:09.070 --> 08:10.580
I'm heading up to our party.

08:10.705 --> 08:12.200
You should join.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.870
Bring your parka.
Expecting flurries.

08:16.044 --> 08:18.622
Cocaine?- Yep.

08:18.747 --> 08:20.542
- Uh, w-wait, Ms. Barracuda.
- Do something.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.212
Do you wanna drop acid tonight?

08:31.927 --> 08:33.804
All right, aim for this crevasse.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.349
Don't hit the maiden slayer.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.101
That's what I'm calling
my face now... the maiden slayer.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.010
Hey, don't worry.
I played a lot of Area 51.

08:40.135 --> 08:41.578
Here we go.

08:41.703 --> 08:44.107
Uh, guys...
We have company.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.776
Oh, fudge.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.779
Oh... you two are here.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.905
And a homeless person.

08:51.071 --> 08:54.409
Okay, Gayle, these are just
a couple more employees of mine.

08:54.816 --> 08:56.726
All right, so where's this acid?

08:56.851 --> 08:58.581
What?

08:58.747 --> 08:59.896
Yeah, where's the acid?

09:00.021 --> 09:01.531
That's a trick question.

09:01.656 --> 09:03.016
It's probably
at a drug dealer's house.

09:03.141 --> 09:03.867
- Uh, Adam...
- No, no. No, no.

09:03.992 --> 09:05.168
We know...
I told them.

09:05.293 --> 09:07.005
Just... it's in the safe.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.355
Mm. Mm-hmm.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.006
Yeah, well, let's...

09:10.131 --> 09:11.508
Get it out, I guess,

09:11.633 --> 09:14.513
and...
Let's do acid.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.546
Alice Murphy, you dog.

09:24.512 --> 09:26.156
Bye.

09:26.281 --> 09:28.148
I already did it.
Was I supposed to wait?

09:31.620 --> 09:32.686
It's good.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.368
Yes. Finally.

09:38.493 --> 09:39.557
So what do you guys wanna do?

09:39.682 --> 09:41.171
Go out to the desert,
shoot some fireworks?

09:41.296 --> 09:42.939
Stare at stars?

09:43.064 --> 09:45.168
I have a better idea.

09:46.401 --> 09:47.677
See that big dick!

09:47.802 --> 09:48.778
Let me see it!

09:48.903 --> 09:50.780
Aah!
It's a big dick.

09:52.207 --> 09:54.308
So are you enjoying your trip?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.119
This is un-[bleep]-real.

09:56.244 --> 09:59.389
It's like all I can hear
is the soundtrack from <i>drive.</i>

09:59.514 --> 10:03.853
But all I see is my mother
right before she died.

10:04.019 --> 10:07.998
You know what I mean, "dirge"?

10:08.123 --> 10:09.833
Yes, of course I know what you mean.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.334
'cause I'm...
I'm trippin' with you guys.

10:11.459 --> 10:13.029
We're all...
We're all gonna trip.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.938
What's it like for you?

10:15.063 --> 10:18.077
For my... my trip is, uh...
Same as yours.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.876
Crazy music, <i>tron</i> soundtrack,

10:20.001 --> 10:22.163
daft punk just bouncing around
in my head and, uh...

10:22.329 --> 10:24.247
Ex-excuse me.
Just keep enjoying your...

10:24.372 --> 10:26.752
I'm good. Go back.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.718
Alice, I am working it over there.

10:28.843 --> 10:30.320
She's interested.

10:30.445 --> 10:31.464
Alice.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.299
You feelin' anything yet?

10:33.465 --> 10:35.049
'cause this ice feels regular cold,

10:35.510 --> 10:36.720
not acid cold.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.562
I don't think mine's working yet.

10:38.687 --> 10:40.330
Yeah, I'm in there.

10:40.455 --> 10:41.831
And it's not good, man.

10:41.956 --> 10:43.602
I'm really trippin', man.

10:46.661 --> 10:51.318
#

10:51.484 --> 10:52.943
You're so lucky, dude.

10:53.068 --> 10:55.111
But, you know, my brain is...

10:55.236 --> 10:56.413
Bigger, more powerful.

10:56.538 --> 10:58.548
So when I do finally trip balls,

10:58.673 --> 11:01.745
it'll last for, like,
40 hours, the peakin'.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.374
Do you think I sound like
one of Marge Simpson's sisters?

11:05.540 --> 11:06.625
I don't...

11:06.981 --> 11:08.751
Oh, don't, don't.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.193
No, don't.
Stop, stop, stop.

11:10.318 --> 11:11.928
People are watching.
Everyone's looking.

11:12.053 --> 11:13.173
People are looking.
Alice...

11:13.339 --> 11:14.364
Alice Murphy.

11:14.489 --> 11:15.465
She's just being nice, right?

11:15.590 --> 11:18.303
That dude is foul.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.243
I gotta get out of here.

11:27.368 --> 11:28.778
The slerms.

11:28.903 --> 11:30.899
It's a psychedelic crisis.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.949
What do you think you pull in
as a stripper?

11:33.074 --> 11:34.784
80 grand? Fuh!

11:34.909 --> 11:37.320
Be your own boss.
Make your own sched.

11:37.445 --> 11:39.741
Free tanning, I've heard.

11:41.082 --> 11:42.325
It's attacking!

11:46.205 --> 11:47.916
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Agh!
- Aah!

11:49.708 --> 11:51.267
Hey, that's too far!

11:51.392 --> 11:52.669
Cody, the...

11:52.794 --> 11:53.714
We're outta here!
Let's vamp!

11:56.698 --> 11:58.385
You just grabbed that dude's dick.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.636
Sorry it didn't work out.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.478
Even though you have
a decent-sized dick,

12:01.603 --> 12:03.682
you don't have moves like Jagger.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.982
What's next?

12:06.107 --> 12:07.784
You guys, wee gonna
keep the party rolling,

12:07.909 --> 12:09.771
but I think we've got some
business to attend to.

12:09.937 --> 12:10.854
Ale.

12:10.979 --> 12:12.649
Oh, right.
Gayle.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.314
Yes, Gayle.
She's right...

12:16.584 --> 12:18.321
Psycho D.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:30.249 --> 12:31.354
Hello.

12:31.479 --> 12:33.753
I'd like Don Walters'
room number, please.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.095
We're not allowed to give out
room information.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.798
Okay, you listen carefully.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.365
You know, we are at war here.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.009
It is Good versus Psycho.

12:40.175 --> 12:42.346
Now, are you with me, [bleep] nut,

12:42.512 --> 12:43.594
or do I need to...

12:46.398 --> 12:48.405
Do I need to...

12:52.229 --> 12:58.552
#

13:11.210 --> 13:12.542
Oh. Mm.

13:17.816 --> 13:19.660
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

13:19.785 --> 13:20.994
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

13:21.119 --> 13:22.996
- I can't do this.
- Alice...

13:23.121 --> 13:23.997
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:24.122 --> 13:25.054
I'm sorry about that.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.434
She's just very upset.
We, uh...

13:27.559 --> 13:30.977
Had a credit card
swap thing at dinner with Don.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.241
Adam... o.M.G.
It's "g."

13:34.366 --> 13:36.276
No doubt.
What does that mean?

13:36.401 --> 13:38.345
It's God.
Behind the desk.

13:38.470 --> 13:40.447
That girl.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.572
That's God.

13:45.677 --> 13:50.163
#

13:50.329 --> 13:52.415
That blonde lady's God.
No shib?

13:52.581 --> 13:54.752
Yes, shib.
Very, very real shib.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.564
- Let me see what I can do.
- Thank you.

14:01.059 --> 14:02.536
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

14:02.661 --> 14:04.638
but I thought
they'd be a little bigger.

14:04.763 --> 14:06.137
Your pups.
Your sweater meats.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.263
- Uh, pardon me?
- Yep, sorry.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.182
Don't want to disrespect.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.642
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.477
I've only had sex with five girls.

14:13.005 --> 14:14.982
And I'm the kind of guy
that needs to just

14:15.107 --> 14:18.485
be slayin' babes with my meat sword.

14:18.610 --> 14:20.254
But I'm not.

14:20.379 --> 14:21.903
It's always in its sheath.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.490
And you're just the woman,
God, to help me with it.

14:23.615 --> 14:26.360
Okay, yeah, also,
why am I not tripping yet?

14:26.485 --> 14:28.495
All my fends are trippin',
and I'm not.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.264
Which is bogus, God.

14:30.389 --> 14:33.267
You do some crazy,
effed-up shib sometimes.

14:33.392 --> 14:37.771
Whoa, God has a picture of me.

14:37.896 --> 14:40.464
Sir, what are you doing?
That's my dog coco!

14:40.880 --> 14:42.382
Help. Help me.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.480
I think this chair is Spanish.

14:46.605 --> 14:49.180
I don't speak Spanish!

14:49.346 --> 14:51.351
I'm not gonna give you
that room number.

14:51.476 --> 14:52.809
Yep, that is correct.
Thank you.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.770
This is on you, Holmvik!
Acid, acid!

14:55.936 --> 14:57.257
Way to drop the ball!

14:57.382 --> 15:00.066
Oh, God.
Acid.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.362
This is...
God, what is your problem?

15:02.487 --> 15:06.867
252!
Walter's room number is 252.

15:06.992 --> 15:08.227
Did God tell you that?

15:08.352 --> 15:10.618
'cause she was bein'
a real bitch to me.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.639
No, I saw the reflection
on the computer screen

15:12.764 --> 15:14.164
in the picture frame.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.943
You know, I always thought
God would be a slob,

15:16.068 --> 15:18.278
like one of us,
not a busty little desk clerk.

15:18.403 --> 15:22.381
More of a stranger on the bus
type, you know?

15:22.547 --> 15:23.851
!

15:23.976 --> 15:25.352
Sorry, but I wish I was tripping.

15:25.477 --> 15:27.594
And I'm not, and it's bothersome.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.722
Housekeeping.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.159
Hey, this is just business.

15:32.284 --> 15:33.217
We're gonna handle this
like adults, right?

15:34.850 --> 15:36.697
- Hello?
- Fresh towels!

15:36.822 --> 15:38.563
All right, Don, where is she?!

15:39.157 --> 15:40.534
What? Who's Don?

15:40.659 --> 15:42.469
Don't lie to me.
I know this is his room.

15:42.594 --> 15:44.194
Now tell me where he is!

15:44.360 --> 15:46.540
What are you talking about?
My name is Timothy!

15:46.665 --> 15:50.043
- Ooh...
- I will melt my own face off

15:50.324 --> 15:51.659
in front of your children
if you don't tell me

15:51.825 --> 15:55.449
where the [bleep]
Don "Psycho D" Walters is!

15:55.574 --> 15:56.831
- Alice, don't do that.
- Acid is crazy.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.242
What do you think, kiddies?

15:58.367 --> 16:00.220
Do you want to see me
peel my own face back,

16:00.345 --> 16:02.222
like the top of a grilled cheese?

16:02.347 --> 16:04.157
- You don't wanna see that.
- No.

16:04.282 --> 16:08.662
Aah!

16:08.787 --> 16:10.797
Oh, it's unplugged.
It's unplugged.

16:10.922 --> 16:12.599
That's good.
You can't erase that.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.334
- Uhh!
- W-w-wait, no, no, no!

16:14.459 --> 16:17.070
I saw the number in a <i>reflection.</i>

16:17.195 --> 16:19.239
Uh, we're not supposed to be in 252.

16:19.364 --> 16:20.841
We're supposed to be in 525.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.901
Are you [bleep] with me?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.580
- Agh!
- I will kill you!

16:26.705 --> 16:28.582
I will kill you!

16:28.863 --> 16:31.018
You are really light, by the way.

16:31.143 --> 16:32.452
Like child soldier skinny.

16:32.577 --> 16:34.953
Could carry you into war, Kony-style.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.163
Some of us had
a little too much to drink.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.260
Don's roof party
must still be raging up there.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.828
The roof!
You take me to the roof!

16:41.953 --> 16:43.664
No, Alice, we're not
taking you to the roof.

16:43.789 --> 16:45.299
You're going back to the room.
You're gonna calm down.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.333
- Okay, all right.
- Get her in!

16:46.458 --> 16:47.668
- Ow!
- Ow, Jesus!

16:47.793 --> 16:49.102
- Ooh, no!
- Karl?

16:49.227 --> 16:50.103
No!

16:52.064 --> 16:53.407
- This place is trashed.
- Here we go.

16:53.532 --> 16:54.641
- Uhh!
- All right, you just...

16:54.766 --> 16:55.848
Okay, Alice.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.744
Hey, just cool out.

16:57.869 --> 16:59.269
Cool out, all right?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.546
You stay here.
I'm gonna go to the roof.

17:01.671 --> 17:02.783
And I'm gonna get that contract
with The Barracuda.

17:02.908 --> 17:04.022
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.484
Just need my Gojo.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.521
Which... ah, come on.

17:07.646 --> 17:09.623
Damn it, Karl!
You put it in the water.

17:09.748 --> 17:12.092
Now my Gojo's busted.
The suction cups...

17:12.217 --> 17:14.828
Whoa, I think I just
had my first visual.

17:14.953 --> 17:16.387
Yeah?

17:16.743 --> 17:18.332
No, that's just at dude's gaping...

17:19.991 --> 17:21.702
Yeah. Yeah.

17:21.827 --> 17:23.436
I'll see you later, [bleep]!

17:23.561 --> 17:25.563
I'm gonna finish this!

17:25.836 --> 17:27.263
No, no, no.
Alice. Alice!

17:27.588 --> 17:29.142
What is with all the noise out here?

17:29.267 --> 17:31.178
I'm tryin' to have fun
with this girl's butt.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.004
What do you boys know
about a little butt fun?

17:34.129 --> 17:35.351
Nothin'!

17:41.643 --> 17:44.454
Ms. Barracuda, we've been
everywhere looking for you.

17:44.579 --> 17:46.857
Oh, well, I was helping
your little homeless friend here

17:46.982 --> 17:48.759
with the ice.

17:48.884 --> 17:51.029
And then you know how the story goes.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.630
Actually, I don't know if we do.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.242
Could you please explain that
story to us in detail?

17:56.691 --> 17:58.662
Hang on.
Look...

17:58.828 --> 18:00.203
We'd love to have you
back at Telamericorp.

18:00.328 --> 18:02.372
Can you close it?
I can see the whole...

18:02.497 --> 18:03.907
Sorry.
Sorry.

18:04.032 --> 18:06.044
We won't let you down.
It's still out.

18:06.210 --> 18:06.910
Just tie it up.

18:07.035 --> 18:08.150
I don't want to look at your dick.

18:08.275 --> 18:09.313
Sorry.

18:09.438 --> 18:10.966
We won't let you down.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.175
My boss just really
wants your business.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.817
Yeah, man, she's, like,

18:13.942 --> 18:15.919
gonna kill a dude
and all this over it, I think.

18:16.044 --> 18:17.287
Yeah, well, her tight ass

18:17.412 --> 18:19.265
clearly cannot handle her [bleep].

18:19.431 --> 18:20.600
- Yeah.
- Puddin'.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.225
What?

18:22.350 --> 18:24.328
Would you just sign the
contract for my buddies?

18:24.453 --> 18:26.496
That way, we could go back
in the bathroom.

18:26.621 --> 18:27.858
Do you have a pen?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.132
Yes, yes, I got a pen.

18:29.257 --> 18:31.569
I got a pen. Here.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.571
And... thank you.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.325
There you go.
You got it.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.077
- All right.
- That's a nice touch.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.829
Good to get your name out there.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.706
I know.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.649
Shove it up my ass?

18:45.774 --> 18:47.651
Absolutely.

18:47.776 --> 18:48.852
She's a pervert.

18:48.977 --> 18:50.839
Come on, sunshine.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.690
Where is The Barracuda?

18:53.815 --> 18:55.359
I told you, I have no idea.

18:55.484 --> 18:58.862
Fine... if that's
how it's gonna be...

18:58.987 --> 19:00.097
Whoa.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.057
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Alice, hey, hey!

19:01.223 --> 19:02.332
Hey, look, look, look

19:02.457 --> 19:03.434
we got it.
We signed the cuda.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.561
- What?
- Yeah.

19:08.163 --> 19:09.306
Well...

19:09.431 --> 19:11.808
It's a really good job, Ders.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.177
Thanks. Uh, I mean,
I guess I should...

19:14.302 --> 19:16.213
Tell you I didn't actually do acid.

19:16.338 --> 19:18.325
Well, you guys did it.
I faked it.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.016
I just wanted
to get this done, you know?

19:20.141 --> 19:22.319
Show you what I'm made of.

19:22.444 --> 19:24.011
- All right, whatever.
- All right.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.790
- Whatever.
- Wow, dude, the acid.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.625
- We chanted earlier.
- Relax.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.060
Still got my acid,

19:30.185 --> 19:33.029
and I'm ready for the acid life.

19:33.546 --> 19:34.547
Latro.

19:41.396 --> 19:43.106
Uh, we better get goin', huh?

19:43.231 --> 19:46.676
No. It's finally kickin' in!

19:46.801 --> 19:48.545
What do you see?

19:48.670 --> 19:51.014
I see a beautiful dancing angel God

19:51.139 --> 19:55.018
with flames flickering
from her fingertips.

19:55.143 --> 19:56.153
It's beautiful.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.948
No, that's a guy on fire.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.557
Damn it, I must have got a bum tab.

20:00.682 --> 20:03.495
- This sucks, dude!
- Oh, boy, he's catching.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.205
I'll see you next year, Psycho D!

20:06.371 --> 20:08.333
Yeah!

20:08.499 --> 20:10.626
Oww!

20:10.792 --> 20:12.135
Whoo!
I'm just glad

20:12.260 --> 20:13.203
that I got to stay
in a hotel for once, man.

20:13.328 --> 20:15.038
Now I can say that.

20:15.163 --> 20:16.807
God, I can never show my face

20:16.932 --> 20:18.301
at this convention again.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.810
Ders, just drive me home.

20:19.935 --> 20:21.846
I want to forget any of this
ever happened.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.916
I wish I would have tripped.

20:26.041 --> 20:29.062
Drive me. Drive me!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.354
Oh, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:31.479 --> 20:32.856
Not right now.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.652
This is not negotiable.
Right here. Drive.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.499
By guys.

20:42.624 --> 20:44.100
Have a good trip!

20:44.225 --> 20:48.271
Get it? "Trip"?
God, I am [bleep] <i>funny,</i> bro!

20:48.396 --> 20:50.040
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

20:50.165 --> 20:51.875
- All right.
- Let's go.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.420
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's get out of here now.

21:04.345 --> 21:05.208
There we go.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.271
Huh, that hurt a little.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.934
You know what would numb my pain?

21:09.456 --> 21:10.457
Weed.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.032
They're so beautiful.
