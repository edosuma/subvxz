if his brain was adequately
perfused for those 15 minutes.

00:12.129 --> 00:14.513
We wanted you
to be the first to know.

00:14.706 --> 00:17.241
-It's a girl.
-(cheering)

00:17.259 --> 00:19.426
Red Rock has had to make
some very difficult decisions.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.812
They're turning Chastain
into luxury condos.

One text and you hop on a plane.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.869
Yeah. I would do anything
for you.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.521
Well, there's good news
and bad news.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.765
Bad news first.

00:41.784 --> 00:44.025
Chastain's been sold.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.194
The plan is to turn it
into condos.

00:46.255 --> 00:50.290
Given that the hospital
loses millions,

00:50.442 --> 00:52.943
I think Red Rock
made a smart decision.

00:53.003 --> 00:55.796
With terrible
human consequences.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.206
Atlanta needs Chastain.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.783
The other hospitals
can't possibly absorb

00:59.802 --> 01:01.393
all of our patients.

01:01.586 --> 01:04.638
And thousands of Chastain
employees will lose their jobs.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.714
And two people I love.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.550

Would you consider
putting together

01:16.952 --> 01:18.726
You're the king of takeovers,

01:18.746 --> 01:20.728
and if you're willing
to front some of the cash,

01:20.790 --> 01:23.323

good luck, too.

Sunshine Sara to Nic yourself.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.974
all of Chastain's debts.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.902
But I've done some research,
and in Miami, they voted

40:06.095 --> 40:07.962
to institute
a half-penny sales tax

40:07.981 --> 40:09.647
to fund their public hospital,

40:09.741 --> 40:11.223
and it was massively popular,

40:11.284 --> 40:12.316
worked like gangbusters.

40:12.469 --> 40:13.484
Who-who would run the hospital?

40:13.578 --> 40:14.828
The doctors.

40:15.771 --> 40:16.654
Now, I mean, we can

40:16.790 --> 40:17.914
tighten our belts and still

40:18.107 --> 40:19.732
deliver the best care.

40:19.793 --> 40:21.418
NICHELLE:
Okay.

40:21.611 --> 40:22.585
I will talk to my advisors,

40:22.778 --> 40:24.312
run the numbers,
do the research,

40:24.330 --> 40:25.088
-I'll get back to...
-No, it's just, there isn't,

40:25.239 --> 40:26.164
there isn't time.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.790
You are one of the few leaders

40:27.984 --> 40:29.500
who can act fast in a crisis,

40:29.594 --> 40:30.927
and if you do this,

40:31.120 --> 40:33.245
you'll be saving lives and...

40:33.306 --> 40:36.324
and-and making Atlanta
a leader in reform.

40:36.342 --> 40:37.917
MARSHALL:
And, although I'm sure

40:37.978 --> 40:40.011
this isn't
your first consideration,

40:40.105 --> 40:42.772
you would have
a crack platform to run on

40:42.965 --> 40:46.443
in your
special election campaign.

40:48.321 --> 40:51.355
Well, Mr. Schultz,
your AVM has gotten smaller.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.767
(laughs) Yeah, the glue is doing
exactly what it's supposed to.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.286
No hospice for you.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.437
We'll transfer you
to a skilled nursing facility

40:58.457 --> 40:59.956
to recover, but then,

41:00.125 --> 41:02.517
after that, you'll have
many years of life ahead of you.

41:02.619 --> 41:05.036
What about the hospital?

41:05.188 --> 41:06.521
No, we won't be here.

41:06.539 --> 41:07.797
For Chastain,
there is no happy ending.

41:07.990 --> 41:09.782
I think there is.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.301
Marshall and Bell pulled it off.

41:11.494 --> 41:13.285
They got the governor
to agree to make Chastain

41:13.305 --> 41:15.930
a public hospital, and the staff
will return immediately.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.383
(short chuckle)
This place could actually

41:19.478 --> 41:21.052
be a model for health care.

41:21.146 --> 41:24.439
DEVON:
Yes, the doctors
will be in charge.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.318
Wow, I can't believe it.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.803
It's amazing, right?
Conrad didn't give up,

41:30.864 --> 41:33.138
so neither did Bell or Marshall.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.383
I'll see you guys.
Gonna make some calls.

41:35.485 --> 41:39.979
We're going public.
Means we're still alive.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.557
-And that also means
you can't leave.
-(chuckles)

41:42.575 --> 41:43.983
You know, you can't
change residencies

41:44.093 --> 41:45.560
unless the hospital
goes out of business.

41:45.620 --> 41:47.653
Mass General's off the table.
So now I have just

41:47.714 --> 41:49.923
to call my lawyer about my visa.

41:51.051 --> 41:53.993
Mina, listen to me.

41:54.054 --> 41:57.421
We are going to work this out.
Do you hear me?

41:57.557 --> 41:59.098
I promise.

42:00.543 --> 42:03.836
This has been
such a roller coaster.

42:03.897 --> 42:05.838
(laughs)
Well, look,

42:05.899 --> 42:08.583
it's a happy ending for Henry,

42:08.685 --> 42:11.586
and Nic, Conrad
and baby Hawkins.

42:11.646 --> 42:14.346
(clicks tongue)
Not so happy for Barrett Cain.

42:14.407 --> 42:17.450
EMTs transferred him
this morning.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.921
(ventilators hissing)

42:47.181 --> 42:49.357
(ventilators continue hissing)
