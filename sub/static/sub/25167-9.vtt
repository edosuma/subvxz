00:03.679 --> 00:07.421
- Let the lezza have it!
- This is what you get for touching my sister!

00:07.440 --> 00:09.649
That job was our last chance!

00:09.680 --> 00:11.940
I just stood there
and watched him do it.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.513
They've finally agreed to place
you in emergency foster care.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.079
Just cos they live in some posh house,

00:16.079 --> 00:18.588
- don't mean they're better than us.
- I assumed you would be the busy one

00:18.611 --> 00:20.817
trying to stop your
factory from closing down.

00:20.942 --> 00:22.821
- Looking good, Alya.
- Hi, Cory.

00:22.849 --> 00:25.589
Learned how to spell condom yet?

Donating.

00:47.801 --> 00:49.915
Oh, thank you, Alya!

00:49.936 --> 00:51.715
Such a kind girl!

00:51.744 --> 00:53.254
Second time this week, Auntie.

00:53.258 --> 00:55.394
You are a very good Muslim.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.585
No problem.

01:22.297 --> 01:25.383
I'm afraid we can't give you
a parcel without a voucher.

01:28.487 --> 01:30.894
- It's all right.
- Wait.

01:31.089 --> 01:33.174
Take these for now.

Mummy!

04:04.092 --> 04:06.179
Mate!

04:07.488 --> 04:08.889
Good to have you back, man!

04:08.920 --> 04:10.645
- How are ya?
- Yeah, skiver!

04:11.888 --> 04:15.153
It's public speaking, not reading.

04:17.313 --> 04:19.748
- Mate, hey.
- Mate!

04:21.613 --> 04:23.588
You stink!

04:24.515 --> 04:26.220
Hey, I'm just...

04:27.133 --> 04:28.943
I mean, come on...

04:29.120 --> 04:32.462
let's just say Cory did not have
time for a shower this morning.

04:32.885 --> 04:34.977
You're unbelievable! How was she?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.319
- You got any photographic evidence?
- Wow.

04:37.384 --> 04:40.292
Taking after-school activities
to a whole new level.

04:40.505 --> 04:42.238
What? I was just,

04:42.468 --> 04:44.477
I'm doing my Biology homework.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.239
I didn't see that on the syllabus.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.185
Well, that's cos you're all theory
and no practice, Alya, aren't you?

04:55.767 --> 04:57.688
There he is, risen from the dead.

04:58.535 --> 05:01.128
_

05:01.192 --> 05:02.873
I'll give you that one.

05:14.037 --> 05:17.211
Girls, this is netball,
you can't bounce the ball.

05:18.210 --> 05:19.679
Netball's rubbish, sir!

05:19.680 --> 05:21.968
How come the boys don't have
to play? It's well sexist!

05:24.612 --> 05:25.759
Sir!

05:25.814 --> 05:27.352
Give me, give me the ball!

05:28.259 --> 05:30.843
Get the ball, get the ball, Tahera!

05:31.953 --> 05:33.279
Get it!

05:33.404 --> 05:35.759
Aargh, I broke a nail!

05:36.315 --> 05:38.083
I don't want it!

05:38.475 --> 05:39.759
Seriously?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.795
Can you not see that I'm stood here?

05:41.970 --> 05:45.288
- You totally did that on purpose!
- Not my fault you're a clumsy cow.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.196
Get your lezza hands off me!

05:47.237 --> 05:48.799
Right. That's it!

05:48.800 --> 05:50.403
- You and her.
- Yeah, I'll fight you!

05:50.419 --> 05:51.658
Bring it on!

05:55.694 --> 05:59.231
So ladies, the three
Ps of public speaking...

05:59.236 --> 06:00.930
Prepare, practice, present.

06:01.017 --> 06:04.725
Remember, it's not all about the
winning, it's about taking part.

06:04.850 --> 06:07.236
It's all about winning, Miss.

06:07.613 --> 06:09.980
Miss, is this, er, really
about public speaking?

06:09.998 --> 06:11.656
Or improving the image of the school?

06:11.707 --> 06:13.001
Er, well, Nasreen,

06:13.015 --> 06:15.158
the school could always do
with improving its image.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.182
However, this competition is a platform

06:18.192 --> 06:20.223
for my brightest year 12s to shine.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.115
We won't let you down, Miss.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.599
I've got this, Miss.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.371
Yeah, there's no I in team, Alya.

06:26.496 --> 06:27.799
Yes, Miss.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.804
- But there is in win.
- The Hebden Park lot are here.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.605
Oh, they're here.

06:37.386 --> 06:38.768
Hello.

06:38.893 --> 06:40.359
What are you doing here?

06:40.360 --> 06:42.969
Ah, the powers that be decided
to send my Head of English

06:42.978 --> 06:44.474
to one of the other schools in the trust

06:44.502 --> 06:46.266
leaving me to run today. Still,

06:46.294 --> 06:48.159
that's life working at
The Valley Trust for you.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.618
Suck the life out of you.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.719
- Darren, this is...
- Javid Shah. Deputy Head.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.651
Yeah, Mr Shah, why don't you show
the Hebden Park pupils to the hall?

06:57.656 --> 06:58.950
Thanks.

07:00.995 --> 07:03.734
- He's a bit...
- Tell me about it.

07:03.964 --> 07:08.075
And as Anne Frank said, no-one
has ever become poor by giving.

07:15.748 --> 07:19.216
Charity. Does charity start at home?

07:19.234 --> 07:21.727
On the one hand, there are
those who would argue that,

07:21.852 --> 07:23.926
there are those who would argue that,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.482
because times are rough that...

07:27.979 --> 07:30.276
Does charity start at home?

07:30.600 --> 07:33.675
Now, as someone who regularly
volunteers at food banks,

07:33.718 --> 07:36.216
I can pick up on what
my lovely team mate...

07:36.239 --> 07:37.981
- Don't worry about it.
- ... was trying to say,

07:38.036 --> 07:40.454
before she sadly dropped her notes.

07:41.071 --> 07:44.488
If, like me, she spent all
her spare time helping others,

07:44.663 --> 07:48.445
she would know that an economically
deprived town like Ackley Bridge,

07:48.570 --> 07:50.583
- charity is vital
- _

07:50.708 --> 07:52.794
and should most
definitely start at home.

07:52.826 --> 07:54.254
Give us a tenner then, love!

07:54.664 --> 07:57.068
It's not as simple as
just handing out cash.

07:57.943 --> 08:00.394
A recent government poll showed that,

08:00.400 --> 08:02.001
as well as turning to benefits,

08:02.061 --> 08:04.838
a large majority of low
income families are even

08:04.856 --> 08:06.639
forced to use food banks.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.070
Don't leave charity up to other people.

08:09.195 --> 08:11.815
Every single day, I ask myself,

08:11.866 --> 08:15.357
what more can I do
to help those in need?

08:23.240 --> 08:24.595
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

08:24.628 --> 08:27.995
I need to talk to you about Razia.

08:28.013 --> 08:29.910
Oh, so now you want to talk to me?

08:30.550 --> 08:32.518
Razia needs to watch her mouth.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.251
Hey up, guys.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.073
What's up?

08:56.608 --> 08:58.547
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

08:59.606 --> 09:01.186
Congratulate you?

09:01.720 --> 09:04.093
For what? This?!

09:06.369 --> 09:09.366
- How did you get that?!
- Leave it, Riz.

09:14.259 --> 09:16.681
All that talk about charity...

09:18.064 --> 09:19.704
... look at you.

09:23.891 --> 09:26.113
You're just so full of yourself.

09:27.005 --> 09:30.708
Just a stuck up, spoilt little brat.

09:40.927 --> 09:44.651
First we need to identify
the cells of the rhubarb.

09:44.776 --> 09:47.215
Can't see anything
through this piece of crap.

09:47.631 --> 09:49.945
They're all the same and, well,

09:50.427 --> 09:52.421
everyone else's works, so...

09:52.440 --> 09:55.059
- So what? You saying I'm thick?
- Shut up.

09:56.119 --> 09:57.566
Well, what if I am?

09:59.346 --> 10:01.022
What are you going to do about it?

10:01.077 --> 10:03.170
You and me, after school.

10:03.189 --> 10:04.711
She's a Murgatroyd!

10:06.797 --> 10:07.972
Well,

10:08.912 --> 10:10.371
I'm a Paracha!

10:11.141 --> 10:12.141
Excuse me.

10:12.143 --> 10:14.682
This conversation concerning
the vacuole, is it?

10:14.725 --> 10:19.294
No, sir. It's about the difference
between the living and the dead.

10:19.534 --> 10:20.962
Lovely.

10:21.087 --> 10:25.281
Can anyone remind me of
the purpose of the nucleus?

10:38.621 --> 10:42.524
_

11:01.166 --> 11:03.542
That was meant for a
private WhatsApp group.

11:03.667 --> 11:07.006
Now you know how it feels
to be publicly humiliated.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.105
Is this about that competition?

11:11.165 --> 11:15.159
No, it's about you laughing at
people's desperate situations.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.074
Least now, everyone
can see what you are.

11:42.854 --> 11:44.922
You stuck up cow. Get lost!

11:47.174 --> 11:49.458
Ken, come on. I need this,

11:50.596 --> 11:53.668
come on. Whatever happened to loyalty?

11:54.949 --> 11:57.371
I've been supplying you for ten years!

11:57.380 --> 12:00.180
I'm sorry, Sadiq, but
business is business.

12:01.949 --> 12:03.634
Ken!

12:10.671 --> 12:11.933
Dad?

12:12.394 --> 12:13.900
Why you home, what's going on?

12:13.942 --> 12:16.286
Nothing! Why aren't you at school?

12:16.411 --> 12:18.303
Cos the school's a joke.

12:18.483 --> 12:20.329
I can't stay there.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.602
Please can I go to private
school? I just can't do it!

12:23.979 --> 12:26.070
That school, it's special to me.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.958
How's it going to
look if my own daughter

12:27.977 --> 12:29.243
doesn't want to study there?

12:29.285 --> 12:31.007
But what's more important?

12:31.638 --> 12:34.738
My happiness or your community project?

12:44.854 --> 12:49.080
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

12:56.581 --> 12:58.216
It's not too late, you know.

12:58.497 --> 13:02.039
This is what happens when
you mess with a Murgatroyd.

13:06.341 --> 13:09.196
- Come on!
- Please!

13:13.774 --> 13:15.211
Please!

13:16.136 --> 13:17.381
I'm not doing this.

13:17.427 --> 13:18.900
You what?!

13:19.237 --> 13:21.277
What you doing? Smack her!

13:23.764 --> 13:25.303
Just go home.

13:26.408 --> 13:28.264
I'm not fighting you.

13:30.221 --> 13:32.315
- Go home.
- Get off me.

13:32.340 --> 13:33.888
Let's go.

13:35.228 --> 13:36.601
Ow!

13:45.351 --> 13:46.653
Oh, my God!

13:46.870 --> 13:48.666
- Are you OK?
- Nas?

13:53.083 --> 13:56.100
You'd better have a very
good explanation for this.

13:56.607 --> 13:58.592
Nas, you all right? What's happened?

13:58.600 --> 14:00.463
We'll get you to hospital.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.621
Have you even been out today?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.003
Hi.

16:15.378 --> 16:16.820
Mum!

16:18.672 --> 16:20.136
Mum!

16:24.120 --> 16:25.349
Mum!

16:25.419 --> 16:28.035
Wait till I get my
hands on that Sam girl.

16:28.099 --> 16:30.355
I knew she were trouble
when she walked in.

16:30.383 --> 16:33.110
Like your Taylor Swifty. Come.

16:34.671 --> 16:37.125
I mean, what kind of parent
bring up their children

16:37.144 --> 16:39.524
thinking it's OK to carry a weapon, huh?

16:39.543 --> 16:41.224
That song's well old.

16:41.532 --> 16:44.816
Three hours in casualty! Three hours!

16:44.890 --> 16:47.870
Bloody government! More
cutting than in hair salon.

16:48.124 --> 16:50.417
Lucky it was just a scratch.

17:03.424 --> 17:04.915
A week?!

17:05.354 --> 17:07.397
Miss Carter, is this really necessary?

17:07.444 --> 17:10.732
Sadiq, she humiliated Cory Wilson
in front of the entire school.

17:10.751 --> 17:12.719
I am not staying in
isolation for a week.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.319
I have exams to pass.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.785
Don't I, Miss Carter?

17:30.598 --> 17:31.988
She won't be here long.

17:32.173 --> 17:33.992
She's asked Dad to send
her to private school.

17:34.033 --> 17:36.350
Full of stuck-up cows,
she'll fit right in.

17:36.433 --> 17:39.206
Seriously?! My dad literally
puts food in your mouth.

17:39.252 --> 17:41.799
We all know who gets the free
school meals round here, don't we?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.155
Do you never learn?!

17:43.195 --> 17:44.950
Bunch of sheep, the lot of you.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.709
Oh, but it's all right when they're
following you, isn't it, Alya?

17:47.759 --> 17:50.206
Oh, so you're speaking to me now?

17:50.247 --> 17:52.269
I thought you only had
time for white girls.

17:52.297 --> 17:54.908
Don't you think you should
be quiet, young lady?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.032
Oh, come on, it's embarrassing
watching you crawl.

17:57.050 --> 17:58.355
Alya, that's enough.

17:58.377 --> 18:01.399
Mr Simpson. If you want to
be taken seriously round here,

18:01.400 --> 18:03.098
you might want to grow a pair.

18:03.287 --> 18:04.461
And as for you,

18:04.480 --> 18:07.424
surely that care in the community
scheme has come to an end.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.959
You need to stop your
mouth now, young lady!

18:10.960 --> 18:13.039
Come back to me when you've learnt
how to speak English properly.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.315
Mate, I'm literally
a foot away from you.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.392
Oh!

18:41.424 --> 18:44.159
Wait til me dad finds out,
not only have you had me mum,

18:44.160 --> 18:46.218
nicked all the food out
of the fridge and all!

18:52.906 --> 18:55.610
You OK? What was all that about?

18:58.801 --> 18:59.998
Mate,

19:00.270 --> 19:03.591
want me to see if Mrs Paracha
has some frozen peas for that?

19:03.637 --> 19:06.267
No, no, it's OK.

19:07.151 --> 19:10.329
I don't think there's any
lasting damage, anyway.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.616
Is it true, though, what she said?

19:15.570 --> 19:18.190
I mean, that's like
using women for food.

19:18.748 --> 19:20.226
Pretty messed up.

19:28.328 --> 19:30.162
Mate, things can't be that bad.

19:31.346 --> 19:32.604
Can they?

20:00.987 --> 20:02.488
Everything alright?

20:02.861 --> 20:05.155
No. No, it isn't.

20:05.358 --> 20:06.942
What's wrong?

20:09.337 --> 20:10.922
I've lost my factory.

20:11.815 --> 20:13.874
My business, I've lost everything.

20:15.261 --> 20:17.803
I've been trying so hard
to keep things going but

20:18.259 --> 20:21.475
then this week I lost a big contract.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.828
Well, how long's this been going on for?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.104
- Six months.
- Six months?!

20:26.122 --> 20:28.245
Sadiq, why didn't you
come and see me earlier?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.834
I haven't even told my family yet.

20:32.123 --> 20:34.599
- I still want to be sponsor.
- What?

20:34.600 --> 20:38.115
We both know this is
about more than just money.

20:38.314 --> 20:40.479
I've invested years into this school.

20:40.604 --> 20:42.468
It's important to me.

20:42.988 --> 20:46.138
The mattress business I
inherited from my father,

20:46.419 --> 20:49.059
but this place, I built it from scratch.

20:49.547 --> 20:52.858
If I lose this, I'll
be a laughing stock.

20:53.848 --> 20:57.719
How's the school supposed to
survive with a bankrupt sponsor?

20:57.929 --> 20:59.942
I'll be letting all the families down.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.452
I promised them a better
future for their kids.

21:05.050 --> 21:06.971
We don't need my money.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.964
We can just make the
government money go further.

21:11.608 --> 21:13.889
I need... I need to think.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.091
- I just need to think.
- Mandy?

21:17.360 --> 21:20.839
- The Paracha-Murgatroyd meeting?
- Yes. Thank you, Javid.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.224
Fighting.

21:50.349 --> 21:51.847
Again!

21:53.661 --> 21:56.298
You're no better with your bullying.

21:59.302 --> 22:01.785
Well, for three girls who are
never short of conversation,

22:01.808 --> 22:03.203
you're suspiciously quiet.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.554
- We can sit here all day if you want.
- Oh, hang on, sweetheart.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.207
I've got things to do.

22:12.226 --> 22:14.326
Fine. Right, well, in that case,

22:14.511 --> 22:17.311
Sam, I'm going to make arrangements
for you to be transferred

22:17.334 --> 22:19.246
to a pupil referral unit.

22:19.283 --> 22:21.678
- A what?!
- We should be calling the police.

22:21.687 --> 22:23.797
I'll call them for you, huh?

22:23.852 --> 22:25.492
I knew this was a mistake.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.680
You coming to this
school. With that lot.

22:27.749 --> 22:31.395
- That lot?!
- You can't say stuff like that, Grandpa.

22:31.689 --> 22:35.329
My granddaughter has been
radicalised by you bloody Muslims!

22:35.366 --> 22:37.324
You don't even know
what radicalised means?!

22:37.347 --> 22:38.461
You're happy to eat our curry

22:38.475 --> 22:39.599
- or have the doctor save your life.
- I hate curry,

22:39.613 --> 22:41.141
- Mr Murgatroyd, please!
- and I wouldn't have a Muslim doctor

22:41.160 --> 22:43.872
- anywhere near me, love.
- Grandpa, that's racist!

22:46.410 --> 22:48.501
Call yourself a Murgatroyd!

22:48.561 --> 22:52.108
- I know what I'd call you!
- Oh, please stop! It was not Sam's fault.

22:57.725 --> 23:01.936
Look, she's just
confused, Miss. Must be...

23:02.296 --> 23:04.895
Must be all the blood she's lost.

23:06.801 --> 23:09.858
Miss Carter, Sam didn't stab me.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.025
Razia did.

23:13.221 --> 23:14.672
Yes.

23:14.797 --> 23:16.404
Razia.

23:18.989 --> 23:22.144
You're a snitch and I hate you!

23:24.251 --> 23:28.102
She'll... be transferred
to a pupil referral.

23:28.114 --> 23:30.065
I'm sorry.

23:33.186 --> 23:36.784
Razia! How could you do such a thing?

23:46.957 --> 23:48.650
I didn't know we had guests.

23:48.685 --> 23:50.683
I invited him.

23:55.580 --> 23:58.419
Mr and Mrs Nawaz. This is amazing.

24:12.891 --> 24:14.877
How do you eat this stuff?!

24:16.235 --> 24:18.152
With these!

24:26.241 --> 24:29.310
No, seriously, Mrs Nawaz. You
should go on MasterChef or something.

24:29.374 --> 24:32.517
I mean, this is amazing.

24:33.075 --> 24:35.218
I have to go. I've got a meeting.

24:35.246 --> 24:38.897
But what about dinner? Sadiq!

24:44.326 --> 24:47.337
Could I... use your bathroom?

24:47.561 --> 24:49.058
Yeah.

25:38.166 --> 25:40.227
This isn't Through the Keyhole.

25:40.527 --> 25:42.323
Toilet's that way.

25:45.236 --> 25:48.472
You just think you're so much
better than everyone else, don't you?

25:51.315 --> 25:54.252
_

26:23.983 --> 26:26.447
What are you saying,
you expected me to lie?

26:26.482 --> 26:28.802
- For your sister!
- You actually stabbed me!

26:28.836 --> 26:30.523
I didn't do it on purpose.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.630
Soon only dogs will
be able to hear them.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.292
- With any luck.
- This is all your fault!

26:34.306 --> 26:36.023
How's this all my fault? You stabbed me!

26:36.037 --> 26:38.557
And you got me put in
a pupil referral unit!

26:38.580 --> 26:41.039
What is going on with
you two and this girl?

26:42.186 --> 26:45.300
Missy Booth, tell me. What is happening?

26:45.378 --> 26:48.252
- That Sam girl! She's a violent.
- Well violent.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.502
And she's a moody.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.506
- Well moody.
- And she's...

27:05.536 --> 27:07.649
Sam's my girlfriend.

27:10.130 --> 27:13.015
She's your girlfriend.

27:21.225 --> 27:22.486
Mum!

27:22.503 --> 27:25.462
- How are you not kicking off?
- It's alright, putre.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.757
I been to Hebden Bridge.

27:30.125 --> 27:32.839
Sam Murgatroyd's your girlfriend?

27:32.840 --> 27:36.879
- You're a lesbian?
- Raz, come on. This isn't easy for her.

27:37.048 --> 27:38.697
Are you a lesbian as well?

27:38.766 --> 27:41.968
What... ? No, shut up!

27:44.091 --> 27:47.324
Look she isn't exactly my number
one choice for you either, but...

27:49.706 --> 27:52.143
You can't help who
you fall for, can you?

27:52.437 --> 27:53.819
No.

27:54.142 --> 27:55.832
No, you can't.

28:01.258 --> 28:05.413
Jaa-o, jithay tuhaada dil karda hai.
Jaa-o, par apnay sur noo lai kay.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.315
What does that mean?

28:12.718 --> 28:14.335
Follow your heart and
take your head with you.

28:14.353 --> 28:15.914
That's what that means.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.812
That's beautiful.

28:18.641 --> 28:21.095
That one of them ancient sayings?

28:21.362 --> 28:23.656
No. Fridge magnet.

28:25.342 --> 28:28.143
- Well, I'm going to pack anyways.
- What? Why?

28:28.166 --> 28:30.220
Cos I'm moving into Nana's room.

28:30.299 --> 28:31.524
Raz!

28:32.376 --> 28:35.258
- I'm gay!
- Get over it. Shut up!

28:42.852 --> 28:45.601
My jewellery! It's gone! All of it!

28:45.680 --> 28:47.618
Even the ring Dadi left me!

28:48.111 --> 28:49.456
Cory!

28:49.718 --> 28:52.426
- He was upstairs! I caught him snooping around.
- Where's my phone?

28:52.459 --> 28:53.481
Where are you going?

28:53.513 --> 28:54.642
- Where's my phone?
- To Cory's!

28:54.660 --> 28:57.506
You know where he lives
don't you! Call Dad!

29:09.091 --> 29:10.583
Where is it?

29:11.605 --> 29:13.503
Mum's jewellery's been nicked.

29:14.369 --> 29:15.917
And you think I took it?

29:16.317 --> 29:17.925
You've done it to get back at me.

29:18.542 --> 29:19.725
What's she on about?

29:19.850 --> 29:22.719
I didn't take your poxy jewellery, OK!

29:22.844 --> 29:24.519
Then why does she think you did?

29:24.644 --> 29:26.228
Because you're skint!

29:30.782 --> 29:31.874
Yeah.

29:32.975 --> 29:34.223
Yeah, we are.

29:36.047 --> 29:37.470
Why is that, Dad?

29:39.119 --> 29:40.261
Eh?

29:42.835 --> 29:45.439
It's cos you just sit on
your backside and do nothing!

29:45.889 --> 29:48.132
You've got one kid in
foster care and another one

29:48.141 --> 29:50.006
picking up women and nicking their food!

29:52.397 --> 29:54.364
We'd be better off without you.

29:57.141 --> 29:58.564
Hang on.

30:02.073 --> 30:03.767
Cory didn't take the jewellery.

30:09.672 --> 30:11.574
How could you let it get to this?

30:11.740 --> 30:13.753
You pawned the ring Dadi left me.

30:13.928 --> 30:16.318
I was trying to save our home!

30:19.588 --> 30:23.595
I needed the money to keep
up with the mortgage payments.

30:24.844 --> 30:27.206
But we paid off the mortgage.

30:29.965 --> 30:32.360
You remortgaged without telling me?

30:35.464 --> 30:39.618
I was trying to make both the
business and the school a success.

30:41.032 --> 30:43.039
You overpromised, Sadiq.

30:43.270 --> 30:45.316
You always do.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.891
I'm sorry.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.290
I really am sorry.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.300
I'll make it right.

31:06.470 --> 31:08.557
You'd better tell your
sister we're on our way.

31:08.598 --> 31:10.012
Aunty Zehra?

31:10.349 --> 31:11.905
We can't go there.

31:28.443 --> 31:31.460
Come, all of you. I've made chai.

31:31.511 --> 31:33.496
Welcome home.

31:54.290 --> 31:55.799
Mand.

31:56.809 --> 31:58.924
You've put yourself in isolation?

32:02.692 --> 32:04.359
Sadiq's gone bust.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.929
What?!

32:09.172 --> 32:10.545
What do I do?

32:11.240 --> 32:15.595
- Find another sponsor?
- You're joking, aren't you?! Who? Where?

32:16.065 --> 32:18.498
Keep him without the cash?!

32:20.080 --> 32:22.172
I don't know. Maybe?

32:24.564 --> 32:26.147
What's the alternative?

32:26.176 --> 32:29.066
We get taken over by
a multi-academy Trust?

32:30.206 --> 32:32.903
They won't care about you
or me or any of the staff

32:32.921 --> 32:34.999
who worked so hard to
give these kids a chance.

32:35.008 --> 32:38.019
You heard Darren. It's
all about money with them.

32:38.558 --> 32:40.102
What are you gonna do?

32:40.227 --> 32:41.902
Miss Carter!

32:42.381 --> 32:46.126
- Miss Carter! Miss Carter!
- Jordan?

32:47.447 --> 32:48.926
Miss Carter, it's me dad!!

32:52.113 --> 32:54.536
- Dad!
- Get down from there, you daft git!

32:54.578 --> 32:55.914
What is he doing?

32:56.130 --> 32:57.858
Dad! Get down!

33:01.492 --> 33:03.371
Get down now!

33:05.218 --> 33:06.688
Has anyone called the police?

33:06.706 --> 33:08.439
Come on, Dad, what you doing up there?

33:08.682 --> 33:10.547
Please just get down, will you?

33:10.593 --> 33:12.109
What's he doing up there?

33:12.122 --> 33:14.057
Well, I don't think
he's fixing the roof.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.959
Do you remember when Mum left us?

33:24.562 --> 33:26.239
You know, when she walked out.

33:26.616 --> 33:28.836
Do you remember what you said to us?

33:31.752 --> 33:33.847
I said I'd never leave you.

33:35.671 --> 33:37.900
Can someone do something, man?

33:46.378 --> 33:49.298
I'm sorry for what I said before, OK?

33:50.192 --> 33:51.924
We do need you.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.373
Just come down, Dad.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.549
All right.

34:07.058 --> 34:08.844
I'll come down.

34:19.246 --> 34:20.973
I need an ambulance, please.

34:21.706 --> 34:22.978
Dad?

34:23.456 --> 34:24.779
Dad?

34:29.485 --> 34:31.103
I'm sorry.

34:32.291 --> 34:33.967
I'm sorry, lads.

34:42.925 --> 34:45.674
Come on. Come on, Dad.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.650
Auntie Zehra...

35:11.973 --> 35:14.801
- ... what's your Wi-Fi code?
- Shh.

35:15.151 --> 35:16.786
Wi-Fi.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.060
- What's your Wi-Fi code?
- Shh.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.595
We don't have it, sweetie.

35:21.626 --> 35:23.879
But everybody's got Wi-Fi.

35:34.759 --> 35:36.163
You OK, puttar?

35:38.425 --> 35:41.368
Cory's dad just tried to kill himself.

35:48.959 --> 35:52.235
I'm getting a jumbo battered
sausage, I'm done in after all that.

35:52.271 --> 35:53.698
I'll have meat and potato pie,

35:53.703 --> 35:55.858
chips peas, gravy and
a buttered teacake.

35:55.983 --> 35:57.799
Diet going well then, Gramps?

35:57.800 --> 35:59.340
Yeah, very funny.

36:09.490 --> 36:11.039
Don't even.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.226
I wasn't even going to say a word.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.058
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

36:45.458 --> 36:46.743
Ta.

36:52.662 --> 36:54.569
So how was the hospital?

36:55.706 --> 36:58.538
Y... yeah, he, er...

37:00.240 --> 37:03.848
- ... he's been sectioned, so...
- Oh.

37:06.864 --> 37:08.509
How is the new place?

37:08.734 --> 37:10.309
Well...

37:10.880 --> 37:14.799
... I mean, I'm sharing what
can only be described as a shed

37:14.800 --> 37:20.153
with my dad, mum, brother, uncle,

37:20.200 --> 37:23.839
heavily pregnant auntie, three cousins

37:23.840 --> 37:27.770
and some random old lady
that I'm probably related to

37:27.770 --> 37:30.119
but I have no idea who she is.

37:32.828 --> 37:34.578
Ah, and we only have one toilet.

37:37.867 --> 37:39.594
So no pool, then?

37:40.893 --> 37:42.362
Over swimming.

37:42.487 --> 37:44.509
Chlorine dries the skin.

37:50.023 --> 37:51.432
Anyway,

37:51.745 --> 37:53.228
I'm glad you came.

37:59.349 --> 38:01.635
Cory, you and me, we could...

38:01.760 --> 38:04.167
I just... I came to say
that I... I really...

38:04.200 --> 38:06.216
Do you want gravy with these?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.697
Nice.

38:25.901 --> 38:28.019
Erm, what did she want?

38:30.124 --> 38:32.086
She just came to say sorry.

38:40.216 --> 38:41.427
Dad...

38:41.635 --> 38:43.297
... why are you doing this?

38:44.596 --> 38:46.553
The governors are meeting today.

38:46.848 --> 38:48.814
I need Mandy to back me.

38:49.082 --> 38:52.284
- I've put so much into this place.
- But you've got nothing.

38:53.171 --> 38:56.377
Your grandad, when he started
the factory, had nothing.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.849
Me, I'm building back up.

39:00.298 --> 39:02.583
Everybody knows what's happened.

39:04.403 --> 39:06.049
So?

39:06.320 --> 39:07.842
All the more reason to show them

39:07.883 --> 39:09.915
that I'm serious about
getting back on my feet.

39:10.422 --> 39:11.876
You do the same.

39:37.190 --> 39:39.976
I shouldn't have made you
look bad at the competition.

39:44.914 --> 39:46.254
I'm sorry.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.250
I'm sticking around so...

39:58.009 --> 40:01.131
You've got way too much attitude
for private school anyway.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.466
So what did I miss?

40:03.517 --> 40:05.736
Another episode of
Tahira's Hideous Hijabs.

40:05.764 --> 40:07.916
- Take a look at that!
- Oh, my God!

40:07.934 --> 40:10.208
- It's disgusting.
- Yeah, I know.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.391
- Missed you guys.
- We missed you.

40:12.516 --> 40:15.011
- Aww.
- Yeah.

40:15.136 --> 40:17.722
It is. It's just hideous.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.517
Hey, bro.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.284
Hey, you ought to see the
amount of food at ours.

40:31.556 --> 40:33.629
The whole estate's been round.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.672
We've got all sorts there.

40:35.741 --> 40:37.394
Lasagna...

40:37.519 --> 40:41.643
... cake, some weird soup kind of thing...

40:46.076 --> 40:48.689
Can't eat it all by myself, like.

40:54.020 --> 40:56.640
Jord, you belong at home.

41:00.751 --> 41:02.409
With me.

41:06.416 --> 41:08.069
What about Dad?

41:08.102 --> 41:10.002
He's getting fixed.

41:12.380 --> 41:14.401
He's going to be OK.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.727
What type of cake is it?

41:22.581 --> 41:24.567
Carrot cake.

41:26.645 --> 41:28.959
No, I'm all right then,
I'll stay out, mate.

41:28.983 --> 41:30.999
Not if I have anything to do with it!

41:39.110 --> 41:41.874
Look at that mardy face.

41:42.225 --> 41:43.958
Come on.

41:43.986 --> 41:45.937
Come on!

41:47.607 --> 41:50.255
Er, do you want to tell
me where you're taking me?

41:50.480 --> 41:53.387
Oh, love it when the sun's out.

41:53.767 --> 41:56.479
- Where are we going, Missy?
- You'll see!

41:56.604 --> 41:59.585
I'm really not in the m... no,
I know exactly what you're doing.

42:00.063 --> 42:01.859
Come on.

42:02.941 --> 42:04.743
Ahem.

42:05.549 --> 42:07.846
See if you can do
something about this...

42:07.875 --> 42:09.635
... will you, eh?

42:09.654 --> 42:12.256
Come on, have fun.

42:20.196 --> 42:22.401
Sorry about my grandpa.

42:22.526 --> 42:24.439
He's old school.

42:25.222 --> 42:27.485
You mean a racist.

42:27.721 --> 42:29.333
Well...

42:29.644 --> 42:31.734
- Yeah.
- Mm.

42:36.668 --> 42:39.973
I told my family that
you're my girlfriend.

42:45.511 --> 42:47.364
- What?
- OK.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.231
It's not funny!

42:53.340 --> 42:55.879
No, you can't seriously
be considering this.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.612
The governors aren't going to agree

42:57.629 --> 43:00.275
to a bankrupt businessman
as a credible sponsor!

43:00.300 --> 43:01.759
- Now just a second.
- No.

43:01.760 --> 43:05.439
Our best bet is to put ourselves
forward for a multi-academy trust.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.639
They pick up failing
schools all the time.

43:07.663 --> 43:09.330
We are not a failing school!

43:09.353 --> 43:12.236
You run this place like
it's social services!

43:12.305 --> 43:14.115
Now hold on a minute.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.708
A trust have the talent
and the resources.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.057
They could make this
place a real success.

43:19.182 --> 43:21.079
Some corporate type in an office

43:21.093 --> 43:23.511
who doesn't understand
the kids like we do.

43:23.525 --> 43:26.555
To them, they're just numbers.

43:26.882 --> 43:28.558
The governors are here.

43:29.801 --> 43:34.002
I am going to do everything in
my power to save this school.

43:35.375 --> 43:37.399
Now, if you truly believe that,

43:37.400 --> 43:40.556
you'll go out there and
beg a trust to take us on.

44:01.671 --> 44:04.780
Javid Shah. I'm here for
a meeting with the CEO.

44:36.765 --> 44:39.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:39.467 --> 44:41.911
I've convinced the governors
we need to stick with you.

44:43.408 --> 44:45.891
It's a huge risk I'm taking, Sadiq, but

44:46.016 --> 44:49.418
you took a gamble on me when
we first started all this so...

44:49.480 --> 44:52.239
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah, well...

44:52.240 --> 44:54.559
... now we just need to
make it work somehow.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.004
Look, I know we've got
our work cut out but

44:57.202 --> 44:59.839
I'm going to get back on
my feet and you and me,

44:59.840 --> 45:02.107
we're a team and a really good one.

45:02.121 --> 45:04.630
Well, we'd better be because, er,

45:05.040 --> 45:07.315
I'm going to need a
school to come back to...

45:07.347 --> 45:09.073
... when I finish my maternity leave.

45:09.560 --> 45:10.990
Wow!

45:11.400 --> 45:13.755
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

45:13.880 --> 45:16.314
What's one more challenge, eh?

45:16.811 --> 45:19.126
- Thanks, Mandy.
- Yeah.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.919
Give me two seconds, give me two seconds

45:23.920 --> 45:25.590
Hey, Alya.

45:25.646 --> 45:28.428
- Hi, Cory.
- So, erm...

45:28.755 --> 45:30.288
... so I was just thinking, you know,

45:30.298 --> 45:32.785
seeing as though you're not going
to private school or anything...

45:34.167 --> 45:36.351
... well, I just sort of maybe...

45:38.360 --> 45:40.230
Alya, you know this
whole integration thing

45:40.234 --> 45:41.901
that everyone bangs on about...

45:42.758 --> 45:44.403
Mm, you know what?

45:45.160 --> 45:47.811
Integration, it's overrated.

45:48.468 --> 45:49.927
Some things...

45:50.800 --> 45:52.388
... just don't go together.
