00:02.414 --> 00:04.866
The strappy ones are cute,
 but I don't think they're my size.

00:04.914 --> 00:06.892
Yeah, it's fucked up that
you can't try them on.

00:07.024 --> 00:09.087
Yeah, you only get one shot
to steal some asshole's

00:09.151 --> 00:11.259
fancy shoes at the
hipster bowling alley.

00:11.486 --> 00:14.279
Ugh, these rich kids' lives are 
like theme parks,

00:14.373 --> 00:16.353
and this stupid,
ironic bowling alley

00:16.401 --> 00:18.135
is like Poorland: The Ride.

00:18.204 --> 00:20.170
As an actual poor person, 
I resent that.

00:20.232 --> 00:21.434
Well, I'm doing my part

00:21.482 --> 00:22.796
sticking it to the nouveau riche

00:22.854 --> 00:24.773
by stealing a pair of
their designer shoes.

00:24.923 --> 00:27.320
Not that anybody at this
premiere will even notice them.

00:27.376 --> 00:28.572
Who would have thought that
when you were shooting

00:28.619 --> 00:30.346
a student film that one
day you'd be wearing

00:30.394 --> 00:32.494
designer shoes on the red
carpet to promote it.

00:32.542 --> 00:35.026
It will be excited to see
myself on the big screen.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.887
Plus, I shot it in 2012,

00:36.962 --> 00:40.013
so I could either be 5 pounds
thinner or 40 pounds heavier.

00:40.126 --> 00:42.611
- Are you almost done?
- Oh, relax.

00:42.669 --> 00:44.893
You'll be able to pick up
your horrifying saddle shoes

00:44.941 --> 00:46.401
with glitter laces in a minute.

00:46.475 --> 00:48.252
Let me guess, did you
get those pins on Etsy?

00:48.316 --> 00:50.229
Were they like,
what, 15 bucks apiece?

00:50.316 --> 00:53.276
18 bucks, and I think
they're "adorkable."

00:53.726 --> 00:55.063
Etsy is a cult.

00:55.111 --> 00:57.338
Except with arts and crafts
instead of group sex.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.675
So basically camp.
The worst cult.

00:59.779 --> 01:02.119
Hello, these are my bowling
shoes I'm returning.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.033
I sure had a gay old
time bowling in them.

01:04.183 --> 01:06.369
Those are mine, I think.
The Louboutins.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.518
I lost my ticket. 9 1/2, right?

01:09.566 --> 01:12.252
Yep,

"bridesmaids."

gender confirmation with,

03:35.488 --> 03:36.632
we got pussies together.

Oh, well, that sounds more fun

03:39.246 --> 03:40.588

- No.

03:40.676 --> 03:42.581
We have reservations at Sugarfish.
No jokes.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.541
And then tomorrow
we're doing ayahuasca

03:44.589 --> 03:46.186
and having a sound bath.

03:46.498 --> 03:50.487
All right, well,
plaster casting my hole it is.

03:52.151 --> 03:55.002
Do I have an original
thought in my head?

03:55.186 --> 03:57.080

No,
I should put something on the page,

then reward myself

longer I can last at PBS

04:51.871 --> 04:53.643
Well, my Etsy store is taking off.

04:53.909 --> 04:55.307
A couple of women in Ohio

04:55.355 --> 04:57.291

some fertility amulets

04:57.396 --> 04:59.264
and a menstruation charm.

05:00.479 --> 05:01.668
Mom, what's wrong?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.533
Why would you assume
something's wrong?

05:03.620 --> 05:05.088
Because you just showed up
at my door,

05:05.135 --> 05:07.028
- and you never do that.
- Only because your neighborhood

05:07.075 --> 05:08.972
is awful and your apartment has fleas,

05:09.020 --> 05:12.198
but I had to see your
face when I tell you

05:12.706 --> 05:15.145
that we are going to
Barbra Streisand

05:15.193 --> 05:17.143
duet with her dog tomorrow night.

cherry-picked news stories

- She's crafting.

don't eat too much

08:41.453 --> 08:44.067
I just think we women
should support each other.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.369
Yeah, but tell that to the
trans-exclusionary radical

08:46.457 --> 08:49.130
feminists no-better-than-Christian-right
motherfuckers.

08:49.197 --> 08:51.904
I say with love. I'll
go get the ayahuasca.

08:52.012 --> 08:53.411
You girls all good on sweet tea?

08:53.487 --> 08:55.104
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

08:56.207 --> 08:59.684
Hello. Well, who's ready
to see the greatest.

08:59.778 --> 09:02.217
Yeshiva Flatbush graduate
since the guy who sold

09:02.261 --> 09:04.028
those junk bonds
to my sister Bonnie

09:04.129 --> 09:06.895
and then he retired in
Cabo with all her money?

09:06.943 --> 09:09.321
Hi, Marilyn. Thank you for
the tickets, by the way.

09:09.381 --> 09:12.049
- Arthur, how are you?
- Oh, I've never felt more free.

09:12.148 --> 09:13.652
I should have quit that
job a long time ago.

09:13.699 --> 09:15.223
You mean the job
they fired you from

09:15.316 --> 09:16.457
because of your drinking?

09:16.505 --> 09:17.705
Either way,
you're unemployed.

09:17.806 --> 09:20.057
Julie, I'm setting your
Jdate profile to public.

09:20.105 --> 09:22.184
Yes, I made you a Jdate profile.

09:22.334 --> 09:24.348
I got our supplies for lift-off.

09:24.442 --> 09:27.822
There's buckets for vomiting,
yoga mats for lounging,

09:27.962 --> 09:30.007
palm fronds for waving.

09:30.135 --> 09:32.361
And, Wendy, I got you a ThunderShirt

09:32.464 --> 09:33.926
in case you freak out again.

09:34.195 --> 09:36.070
Ooh, sweet tea.

09:43.985 --> 09:45.134
Mm.

09:45.230 --> 09:47.705
Does this sweet tea taste funny?

09:49.034 --> 09:52.337
Is something wrong
with that sweet tea?

09:52.937 --> 09:55.120
That's the weirdest tea
I ever tasted.

09:55.523 --> 09:57.461
What is that taste? Yeah.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.476
I want to say lemon?

09:59.583 --> 10:01.008
Hmm.

10:01.227 --> 10:03.445
Uh-uh. It's definitely not lemon.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.570
It's like persimmon,
but the finish is smoky.

10:05.619 --> 10:08.359
Okay, you are all so dumb.
Let me see.

10:09.819 --> 10:10.974
Chamomile.

10:11.050 --> 10:12.636
- Chamomile?
- Yes.

10:12.911 --> 10:14.344
I don't think that's chamomile.

10:14.392 --> 10:16.742
- It's too tart for chamomile.
- Oh, no, she's right.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.109
- It's chamomile.
- Thank you.

10:18.195 --> 10:19.875
- Really?
- It's chamomile.

10:19.923 --> 10:22.582
- I guess that's chamomile.
- That might be chamomile.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.255
- Yeah, for sure.
- It's chamomile.

10:24.413 --> 10:26.123
- Now I can taste it.
- It's chamomile.

10:26.188 --> 10:27.906
I know my chamomile.

10:28.179 --> 10:29.798
You are correct. It is
chamomile, Marilyn.

10:29.845 --> 10:32.307
Of course I am,
Arthur. Chamomile.

10:32.515 --> 10:35.145
- Chamomile.
- Okay, I can taste it now.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.077
I know because I love chamomile.

10:42.744 --> 10:44.184
Has anyone seen my pitcher?

10:44.300 --> 10:47.055
Oh, the chamomile tea.
We just drank it.

10:47.195 --> 10:48.617
Could we make you another pitcher?

10:48.715 --> 10:50.817
No! No, you can't, you fuckos!

10:50.909 --> 10:52.640
That was ayahuasca.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.851
Wait a minute.
What is ayahuasca?

10:55.957 --> 10:58.036
It's expensive, is what it is.

10:58.137 --> 11:00.460
You dicklicks owe us $1,100.

11:00.653 --> 11:02.469
Come on, girls, let's go.

11:02.926 --> 11:05.750
Somebody call 911. They
gotta pump our stomachs.

11:05.851 --> 11:07.234
No, no, no, do not call the cops.

11:07.282 --> 11:09.433
I have jerked off to enough
episodes of "Locked Up Abroad"

11:09.480 --> 11:11.233
to know that if you call the
cops to report an overdose,

11:11.257 --> 11:12.381
they're just gonna come and arrest us

11:12.428 --> 11:13.484
for having illegal drugs.

11:13.532 --> 11:15.078
Yes, officer, there are five of us.

11:15.191 --> 11:16.911
We've all taken ayahuasca.

11:17.023 --> 11:18.303
I'll describe my daughter first.

11:18.351 --> 11:20.624
Did you ever see the nosy
neighbor in "Small Wonder"?

11:20.672 --> 11:22.672
Well, picture her today 40 years old

11:22.758 --> 11:23.976
with a spotty sexual past.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.586
Hi, I'm sorry.
I'm a crazy old woman.

11:25.634 --> 11:27.735
I dialed the wrong number.
Mayor Bloomberg, Trump Tower.

11:27.782 --> 11:29.062
- Good-bye.
- Okay, okay.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.212
I found a step-by-step
guide to ayahuasca

11:31.260 --> 11:33.322
on Miley Cyrus' fan page.

11:33.743 --> 11:36.265
Step one, small waves of euphoria.

11:36.456 --> 11:39.069
All right, well, that's
exactly how I feel

11:39.117 --> 11:40.977
every time I see the ending
of "Prince of Tides"

11:41.024 --> 11:42.430
or when I look in a mirror.

11:42.490 --> 11:45.031
Step two,
violent constant vomiting.

11:45.135 --> 11:46.742
- Okay.
- "Smash" season two.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.125
Step three, anxiety,

11:48.173 --> 11:49.925
but that only lasts about
15 minutes.

11:50.064 --> 11:51.775
Like the pre-show jitters.

11:51.902 --> 11:53.550
Okay, I'll just do the
breathing exercises

11:53.598 --> 11:55.152
that Michael Feinstein taught me to do

11:55.200 --> 11:57.640
for when my mouth is full but
someone's plugging my nostrils.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.937
And finally, eight to ten hours

12:00.029 --> 12:02.655
of emotional, revelatory hallucinations

12:02.754 --> 12:05.833
that confront you with
your deepest inner truth.

12:06.281 --> 12:07.984
Oh, shit!

12:10.249 --> 12:12.168
So now we get to go see "Chicago."

12:12.216 --> 12:14.211
I am not downgrading from
ayahuasca to watching

Okay, let's both answer
at the same time.

21:41.870 --> 21:44.452
Am I going to craft and be happy

21:44.549 --> 21:47.077
or stay miserable
pursuing a comedy career?

21:47.239 --> 21:49.898

A. And leave New York?

21:50.181 --> 21:52.776

what would happen to me

21:59.099 --> 22:01.405

yesterday because, well,

23:01.563 --> 23:03.644
I've been trying for a
long time to get happy,

23:03.835 --> 23:05.097
and I've tried everything:

23:05.205 --> 23:07.788
Medication, meditation, facial filler.

23:08.122 --> 23:10.085
But the one thing that
worked was giving up

23:10.166 --> 23:12.671
on the only thing I've always
known I've wanted to do.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.639
Look,
I may not be a great performer,

23:15.759 --> 23:16.917
and because I do comedy,

23:16.983 --> 23:18.756
I will always be on
the misery spectrum,

23:18.803 --> 23:22.655
but... this is what I do,
and this is who I am.

23:23.397 --> 23:25.608
I am an unhappy person,

23:25.985 --> 23:29.545
but the alternative is being
somebody I don't know,

23:29.635 --> 23:31.889
and that is terrifying.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.151
So I made a decision.

23:34.425 --> 23:38.811
I am happy to be unhappy.
Thank you.
