00:02.980 --> 00:04.694
<i>Previously on</i> Camelot...

00:04.866 --> 00:06.433
My father, he sent me

00:06.501 --> 00:08.735
to tell you that men are
attacking Bardon Pass.

00:08.803 --> 00:10.921
We lose that, word will spread
of our weakness,

00:10.946 --> 00:12.382
and all our land could
come under threat.

00:12.674 --> 00:15.075
If this is done well,
the only safe place

00:15.143 --> 00:16.807
in the kingdom will
be under my protection.

00:16.832 --> 00:18.635
The crown will fall to me.

00:19.147 --> 00:20.811
Did something happen
between you and the king?

00:20.836 --> 00:22.536
I did a terrible thing,

00:22.550 --> 00:25.419
but I'm still your wife!
You're not my wife;

00:25.486 --> 00:27.688
you're the king's whore.
Cover this up,

00:27.755 --> 00:30.624
or risk losing everything.
What did you do?!

00:30.692 --> 00:32.692
It was the morning
of my wedding.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.762
He had her first.
And then he married us.

00:35.830 --> 00:38.331
- What about Morgan?
- We go to Castle Pendragon--

00:38.399 --> 00:41.401
bring her back before the king
to answer for her treason.

00:41.469 --> 00:44.070
While the entire country
bleeds, you storm in here

00:44.095 --> 00:45.500
with your insane charges.

00:45.907 --> 00:48.275
I will expose the corruption
of this sorcerer.

00:48.342 --> 00:52.412
Let all who seek a safe harbour
find one with me.

00:56.617 --> 00:58.452
Take Kay; take the family.

00:58.519 --> 01:00.454
I'll create a diversion
from the front. Go.

01:00.521 --> 01:03.423
I'll be right behind you.
King Arthur dies at our hands.

01:03.491 --> 01:06.259

Tonight, you fight for the cause
of Morgan Pendragon.

02:48.773 --> 02:51.742
The man who wears her crown
stands in that building.

02:51.809 --> 02:55.746
The sun must rise
on his shredded, burning corpse.

02:55.813 --> 02:57.748
Now, which one of you believes
he can take the sword

02:57.815 --> 02:59.649
from the king's dead hands,
and bring it to me?

02:59.717 --> 03:01.518
- Aye.
- More men are on their way,

03:01.586 --> 03:03.587
but we have the cover of night,
and we'll send an advance scout

03:03.654 --> 03:05.689
to find out
how many are left in there.

03:10.795 --> 03:13.330
Arthur said
he would meet us here.

03:22.407 --> 03:24.307
We should shelter here
for now;

03:24.375 --> 03:25.942
see to the wounded.

03:28.946 --> 03:31.214
We'll wait here for Arthur.

04:06.818 --> 04:08.585
Ah!

05:52.290 --> 05:53.857
You were lucky.

05:53.925 --> 05:56.193
Don't feel it.

05:56.260 --> 05:58.195
Any sign of him?

05:58.262 --> 05:59.963
No.

06:00.031 --> 06:02.065
He said he'd be
right behind us.

06:02.133 --> 06:05.669
He stayed behind
to prove himself to us.

06:05.736 --> 06:07.604
To me.

06:09.941 --> 06:11.374
I should have known.

06:11.442 --> 06:13.743
Stubborn bastard.

06:13.811 --> 06:16.479
How many is he up against?

06:26.924 --> 06:28.858
It's been too long.

06:28.926 --> 06:30.994
Your turn.

06:58.422 --> 06:59.956
Hurry.

07:00.024 --> 07:03.260
Ah!

07:03.327 --> 07:04.928
Ah!

07:09.300 --> 07:11.368
Spread out.

07:24.482 --> 07:25.749
Ah!

07:37.061 --> 07:38.862
We've got him!

07:38.929 --> 07:43.199
Take the sword.
As fast as you can.

07:48.172 --> 07:50.674
I'll finish off the boy.

07:59.483 --> 08:01.318
Ah! Oh!

08:05.389 --> 08:08.191
Ahhhh!

08:11.329 --> 08:13.263
Don't call me boy.

08:16.033 --> 08:17.934
Harwell!

08:18.002 --> 08:19.936
Where's Wallace?

08:20.004 --> 08:24.441
Finishing off the king.
He told me to bring you this.

08:24.508 --> 08:27.711
They have Arthur surrounded.
He's alone in there.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.148
Take it straight to Morgan,
with my compliments.

08:32.216 --> 08:34.951
Ride fast.
I'll follow you.

08:36.886 --> 08:40.590
After I've put a burning torch
to the king's body.

08:40.658 --> 08:46.896
Where is the king? Is he here?
I need to see my brother!

08:46.964 --> 08:50.533
King Arthur is out at Bardon Pass,
repelling an attack.

08:50.601 --> 08:52.761
- ...Lady Igraine this way!
- Untie the king's mother!

08:52.786 --> 08:53.986
Release them!

08:54.538 --> 08:57.240
Before you do anything,
listen.

08:57.308 --> 09:00.877
The realm is under threat.
The sorcerer

09:00.945 --> 09:03.887
and the king's mother ransacked
our castle,

09:03.912 --> 09:05.468
threatened Morgan's life!

09:05.750 --> 09:07.755
These people have come
from all over the realm.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.389
They've been attacked.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.888
They need
their king's protection.

09:11.956 --> 09:13.906
I know many of Camelot's men are

09:13.931 --> 09:16.007
out in the realm fighting
these insurgencies.

09:17.595 --> 09:19.162
My guards can help you.

09:19.230 --> 09:21.297
You are good men
of strong judgment.

09:21.365 --> 09:22.899
Use it now.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.567
Restrain the sorcerer,

09:24.635 --> 09:28.772
and give us protection until
the king, my brother, returns.

09:30.674 --> 09:33.877
It's amazing how
children can sleep anywhere.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.815
Sorry.

09:38.883 --> 09:41.351
It's innocence.

09:41.419 --> 09:44.354
They don't know
what's to come.

09:44.422 --> 09:46.189
Guinevere,

09:46.257 --> 09:48.425
how is she?

09:48.492 --> 09:51.361
That's all right
for a sword wound,

09:51.429 --> 09:53.863
but an arrow wound will
never heal.

09:53.931 --> 09:56.699
Hold this.
Of course.

10:00.871 --> 10:03.640
Ready?

10:03.707 --> 10:06.709
Here.

10:19.824 --> 10:22.192
It's done.

10:33.504 --> 10:34.603
Seal the gates!

10:34.628 --> 10:36.653
We must protect Camelot
from any attack.

10:36.874 --> 10:40.143
Go inside. Find yourselves
shelter and food.

10:40.211 --> 10:42.145
When the king returns,
we shall all address him.

10:42.213 --> 10:44.180
Thank you, milady.

10:44.248 --> 10:46.783
Escort Lady Igraine
to her room.

10:46.851 --> 10:49.452
Make sure she's comfortable
and that she remains there.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.056
I see what you are doing,
and you shall not prevail.

10:53.123 --> 10:55.892
I'll visit you shortly,
my lady.

11:06.804 --> 11:09.205
Did you enjoy our night
together?

11:09.273 --> 11:11.174
Did you really think
I was her?

11:11.242 --> 11:15.445
Was I that good?
Because you were...

11:15.513 --> 11:18.081
...fascinating.

11:20.017 --> 11:21.784
Does she know?

11:21.852 --> 11:24.254
Have you told her
what we did?

11:24.321 --> 11:26.289
How you gave yourself?

11:26.357 --> 11:30.293
Do what you want with me...

11:30.361 --> 11:33.229
...but leave Igraine alone.

11:33.297 --> 11:36.065
It burns, doesn't it?

11:36.133 --> 11:39.269
That sense
of impotence.

11:39.336 --> 11:43.406
Watching what you've worked for
snatched from you.

11:45.309 --> 11:48.578
Keep a watch on him.
He's capable of anything.

11:51.248 --> 11:56.152
Who sent you?!

11:56.220 --> 11:58.588
Wha-wha-what
does it matter?

11:58.656 --> 12:02.158
Oh, it matters.

12:04.128 --> 12:08.798
Who do you fight for?!

12:21.946 --> 12:24.447
Who sent you?

12:26.383 --> 12:29.652
Who?

12:29.720 --> 12:31.020
Last chance.

12:31.088 --> 12:35.158
Morgan Pendragon.

12:40.598 --> 12:42.198
You're lying.

12:48.806 --> 12:51.140
Attack Bardon Pass.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.509
Draw out the king.

12:53.577 --> 12:57.347
Kill him when he shows up
to defend it.

12:57.414 --> 13:01.150
Those were
your sister's orders.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.355
You're a fucked-up family,
all right.

13:10.628 --> 13:13.763
The banner flies,
and Wallace hasn't returned.

13:13.831 --> 13:16.366
Arthur must
still be alive.

13:16.433 --> 13:19.402
How is that possible?!
Let me go down, take 2 men.

13:19.470 --> 13:22.295
No! No, wait
for reinforcements.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.620
I have enough men coming

13:23.641 --> 13:26.809
to overwhelm whatever tricks
he has lined up in there.

13:35.219 --> 13:37.286
You will be safe
here in Camelot.

13:37.354 --> 13:40.590
Let Camelot be your refuge.
God will provide.

13:44.828 --> 13:48.464
Milady, where is the king?
Why isn't he here?

13:48.532 --> 13:50.400
You know where he is.
Protecting the border

13:50.467 --> 13:52.402
of his realm.
People are saying

13:52.469 --> 13:54.570
that he has run off
with his champion's wife.

13:54.638 --> 13:58.041
Don't speak about my brother
in that way.

13:58.108 --> 14:01.978
No woman would distract him
from his duties.

14:02.046 --> 14:04.013
Guinevere must be here.

14:04.081 --> 14:07.183
Let us find her
and prove the truth to you.

14:14.692 --> 14:16.626
No one's to go near him.

14:16.694 --> 14:19.095
He's a prisoner,
not an animal.

14:19.163 --> 14:21.597
Have you seen
Igraine?

14:21.665 --> 14:24.033
I don't know.

14:24.101 --> 14:26.202
Morgan has her guards
all along the corridor.

14:26.270 --> 14:28.871
I can't go anywhere.

14:28.939 --> 14:31.040
Why don't you break free?

14:31.108 --> 14:33.309
And do what? Hmm?

14:33.377 --> 14:37.613
The mad sorcerer
against the people?

14:37.681 --> 14:41.184
They'll never trust me
again.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.152
We need Arthur back.

14:43.220 --> 14:46.222
What if he doesn't come?

14:48.158 --> 14:49.692
He will.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.829
We have to believe
he will.

16:01.899 --> 16:04.600
I said I didn't want

16:04.668 --> 16:06.502
to be disturbed.

16:06.570 --> 16:09.372
I think you'll want
to see this, child.

16:13.977 --> 16:15.912
The king's sword.

16:15.979 --> 16:18.714
A gift from Harwell.

16:21.518 --> 16:23.386
It's done?

16:23.453 --> 16:24.887
It is.

16:24.955 --> 16:28.324
It's a tragedy.

16:28.392 --> 16:32.228
- It's what you ordered.
- Leave her--

16:32.296 --> 16:34.864
to grieve her brother.

16:55.786 --> 16:59.021
This is our time.

17:25.983 --> 17:28.618
This is our final assault.

17:28.685 --> 17:30.219
Find Arthur.

17:30.287 --> 17:33.556
You bring him to me.
We ready?

17:33.624 --> 17:37.727
- Aye! Yeah!
- Then we attack!

19:17.427 --> 19:20.162
Ah!

19:20.230 --> 19:22.832
Over there!

19:36.613 --> 19:38.447
Ugh!

19:38.515 --> 19:41.183
Ooh!

19:49.893 --> 19:51.761
You came back.

19:51.828 --> 19:53.596
I took an oath.

19:55.132 --> 19:57.400
Down!

19:57.467 --> 20:00.202
Ah!

20:00.270 --> 20:01.971
Leontes!

20:05.976 --> 20:08.464
If I'm going down,
I'm taking as many

20:08.489 --> 20:09.879
of them with me as I can.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.114
Amen to that.

20:12.182 --> 20:13.549
For Camelot.

20:13.617 --> 20:16.018
For Camelot.

20:52.556 --> 20:54.690
Run!

20:54.758 --> 20:56.592
Run!

21:20.917 --> 21:23.319
Ah! Oof!

21:59.656 --> 22:03.092
Retreat!

22:25.549 --> 22:26.949
Stupid bastards!

22:38.428 --> 22:40.663
Arthur!!

22:40.730 --> 22:42.398
NO!

22:42.465 --> 22:44.266
Leontes!

23:00.183 --> 23:02.117
Leontes!

23:05.322 --> 23:07.890
Promise me
a warrior's funeral.

23:16.132 --> 23:17.566
I'm sorry.

23:17.634 --> 23:20.703
It's all right.
I get to meet my God.

23:26.843 --> 23:28.911
Treasure her.

24:37.714 --> 24:40.249
I know
you'd hate to miss this.

25:04.174 --> 25:08.577
Our very own Prometheus
brought low by his love of men.

25:34.003 --> 25:37.740
This is
the king's sword.

25:37.807 --> 25:40.809
Just brought to me
with news...

25:40.877 --> 25:44.913
...of his death.

25:51.821 --> 25:54.123
My heart breaks
for my brother.

25:54.190 --> 25:55.657
What now?

25:55.725 --> 25:58.727
Who protects us?

25:58.795 --> 26:04.199
Who will take the crown?
I cannot decide that.

26:04.267 --> 26:08.070
- It should be you.
- Yes.

26:08.138 --> 26:11.507
Your belief touches me,
but I...

26:11.574 --> 26:14.476
There is...
no one else.

26:14.544 --> 26:18.380
You owe it to your father
and your brother

26:18.448 --> 26:21.216
not to leave these people
unprotected.

26:21.284 --> 26:23.719
She's right.

26:23.787 --> 26:27.823
Morgan, you have an obligation
to everyone here,

26:27.891 --> 26:30.492
to everyone
in the land.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.897
Out of this... darkness,

26:34.964 --> 26:38.367
the realm must know
its first queen.

26:38.435 --> 26:40.702
Yes.

26:40.770 --> 26:45.374
- Answer us, please.
- Is it truly your will?

26:45.442 --> 26:48.177
Yes.

26:48.244 --> 26:49.645
Then...

26:49.712 --> 26:52.648
...I accept,

26:52.715 --> 26:54.917
in my brother's memory,

26:54.984 --> 26:58.787
to carry on
the Pendragon line.

27:12.802 --> 27:14.236
Hmm.

27:14.304 --> 27:16.605
I picked that out
for you.

27:16.673 --> 27:20.442
You were looking
a bit dishevelled.

27:20.510 --> 27:23.011
You must look
your best.

27:24.981 --> 27:27.883
You will never
be queen.

27:27.951 --> 27:30.285
You can give birth
to a king,

27:30.353 --> 27:32.387
or you marry one,

27:32.455 --> 27:35.390
but you won't ever
get that crown.

27:38.027 --> 27:40.229
Why did you take
my face?

27:40.296 --> 27:43.232
I asked myself
that same question.

27:43.299 --> 27:47.836
It wasn't my choice,
but now I understand why.

27:47.904 --> 27:51.240
You're the birth
of all this.

27:51.307 --> 27:53.208
You poor child.

27:53.276 --> 27:55.911
What happened to you
these years?

27:55.979 --> 27:58.013
What happened

27:58.081 --> 28:02.050
is that you turned my father
against me.

28:02.118 --> 28:05.554
Until you came,
he loved me without question.

28:05.622 --> 28:10.058
And then you,
and your bastard child.

28:12.161 --> 28:15.197
You never understood.

28:15.265 --> 28:17.432
It doesn't matter now.

28:19.335 --> 28:22.137
You look beautiful,
my lady.

28:22.205 --> 28:24.640
What do you want
from me?

28:27.577 --> 28:29.444
A slow death.

28:40.857 --> 28:42.591
It's all right.

28:42.659 --> 28:44.726
It's fatal.

28:44.794 --> 28:47.763
But it will take some time
for you to bleed out.

28:47.830 --> 28:50.766
Shh.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.467
Queen Igraine.

28:52.535 --> 28:55.671
Look at you now--
that face

28:55.738 --> 28:57.639
my father loved enough
to banish me.

28:57.707 --> 29:00.075
He didn't banish you!

29:00.143 --> 29:02.945
He was going
to have you killed

29:03.012 --> 29:04.580
like your mother.

29:06.649 --> 29:10.786
I sent you away
to keep you safe!

29:12.722 --> 29:15.791
- You're lying!
- Ah! Ah!

29:17.727 --> 29:19.861
I saved you!

29:21.798 --> 29:23.231
I don't believe you.

29:23.299 --> 29:26.902
I took pity on you!

29:29.472 --> 29:31.740
You will never be queen!

30:44.681 --> 30:47.482
They're coming.
It's Arthur!

31:32.161 --> 31:33.729
Ready?

31:57.153 --> 32:00.388
Is this it?
Have I done it?

32:03.159 --> 32:05.627
Yes, my child.

32:08.030 --> 32:10.198
This was everything.

32:10.266 --> 32:12.534
I know.

32:12.602 --> 32:17.339
Now take your throne,
my queen.

32:55.912 --> 32:57.379
Will you swear

32:57.446 --> 33:01.149
to rule this realm
according to the laws

33:01.217 --> 33:03.451
and customs of its people,

33:03.519 --> 33:05.821
and to administer justice

33:05.888 --> 33:07.823
with mercy?

33:07.890 --> 33:09.758
I will.

33:09.826 --> 33:13.461
Will you uphold too
the laws of God

33:13.529 --> 33:16.064
and the true teachings
of his gospel?

33:16.132 --> 33:18.066
I will.

33:18.134 --> 33:23.572
With this crown,
I anoint you, Morgan,

33:23.639 --> 33:26.741
First Queen
of the Britons.

33:36.953 --> 33:39.521
It's the king!

33:45.194 --> 33:47.195
My brother!

33:57.840 --> 33:59.274
You live!

33:59.342 --> 34:03.745
I know
your true face, sister.

34:10.686 --> 34:12.754
One rumour of my death,

34:12.822 --> 34:16.424
and you proclaim
a new leader!

34:16.492 --> 34:18.426
A king could get offended.

34:18.494 --> 34:20.996
Where's Igraine?

34:21.063 --> 34:23.331
Have you seen Igraine?
No.

34:23.399 --> 34:25.934
Which is hard,

34:26.002 --> 34:28.370
because I remember
standing here at my coronation

34:28.437 --> 34:31.206
and seeing hope
in all your eyes.

34:33.141 --> 34:35.243
I've learned so much
since then.

34:35.311 --> 34:38.246
And I have made mistakes.

34:38.313 --> 34:42.617
But I live for one thing now.

34:42.685 --> 34:44.753
Your hope.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.091
And how to deliver on it.

34:46.116 --> 34:48.559
We were attacked!
Where were you?

34:49.558 --> 34:51.960
You went away.
Where were you?

34:52.027 --> 34:53.962
Where was I, Morgan?

34:56.565 --> 34:59.000
If she takes the crown,

34:59.068 --> 35:01.403
I'll tell you
what you get.

35:01.470 --> 35:02.904
Fear!

35:02.972 --> 35:05.974
That's what she instils
in everyone.

35:06.042 --> 35:09.311
Fear is so much stronger
than hope.

35:09.378 --> 35:11.346
But it will never win.

35:11.414 --> 35:16.618
I'll take my sword and my crown.

35:16.686 --> 35:18.105
It's not that easy.

35:18.130 --> 35:19.641
You've lost the will
of the people.

35:19.755 --> 35:21.589
That belongs to the king.

35:23.459 --> 35:26.995
Out of my way!

35:32.969 --> 35:36.237
Tell them what she did.

35:43.045 --> 35:47.015
Morgan plotted
against the king.

35:47.083 --> 35:51.086
We were to attack Bardon Pass
last night.

35:52.989 --> 35:57.158
We were sent with orders:
kill the king.

35:57.226 --> 36:00.362
He's a liar.
Talking to save his life!

36:00.429 --> 36:03.365
My champion, Leontes,
died at the hands of your men.

36:03.432 --> 36:05.767
You accept the words of liars
who'd wish to disrupt our unity!

36:05.835 --> 36:07.769
Why would you profess
your loyalty to me

36:07.837 --> 36:11.906
in public, while sending men
to kill me in private?

36:11.974 --> 36:14.442
You understand
the punishment for treason.

36:14.510 --> 36:17.512
Have you anything else
to say?

36:17.580 --> 36:19.781
It wasn't her!

36:22.018 --> 36:25.053
It was me.

36:25.121 --> 36:27.856
I planned it all.

36:29.825 --> 36:32.761
I told Morgan
none of this.

36:32.828 --> 36:35.202
She may be queen by rights,

36:35.227 --> 36:38.001
but our laws are made
by feeble men.

36:38.467 --> 36:42.237
I confess to my treason.
Do whatever you want with me.

36:42.304 --> 36:44.906
Morgan knew none of it.

36:44.974 --> 36:46.908
Hold her.

36:48.844 --> 36:50.355
You understand the punishment

36:50.380 --> 36:52.837
for treason and murder is
execution.

36:54.450 --> 36:57.352
Was this all
her own doing?

37:03.392 --> 37:05.994
I would never plot
against you, my brother.

37:09.865 --> 37:12.200
You have blood
on your hands.

37:23.145 --> 37:24.712
Igraine.

37:34.156 --> 37:36.191
You came.

37:43.632 --> 37:46.801
What happened?
Who did this?

37:54.910 --> 37:56.478
I'm dying,

37:56.545 --> 37:58.480
aren't I?

37:58.547 --> 38:01.449
No, no.

38:01.517 --> 38:05.887
I won't let you.
I won't let you.

38:05.955 --> 38:07.388
You hear me?

38:20.136 --> 38:23.404
What are you doing?!

38:23.472 --> 38:26.307
I won't let you.
I won't let you.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.244
I will not lose
anyone else.

38:29.311 --> 38:30.979
Stop!

38:31.046 --> 38:32.480
Stop!

38:32.548 --> 38:35.183
No, no!

38:37.119 --> 38:40.088
Not by killing yourself!

38:40.156 --> 38:42.190
I can save you.

38:44.827 --> 38:46.895
Protect...

38:46.962 --> 38:49.564
...Arthur.

38:49.632 --> 38:51.699
Please.

39:03.946 --> 39:05.713
Shh...

39:59.301 --> 40:01.236
I'm sorry.

40:01.303 --> 40:03.838
It's not your fault.

40:32.101 --> 40:34.535
I swear...

40:36.438 --> 40:39.974
...I will be everything
you ever hoped I'd be.

40:42.945 --> 40:44.979
I will be better.

40:46.915 --> 40:48.983
And I will make you proud.

40:53.088 --> 40:55.690
I will build it all here
for you.

40:58.260 --> 41:00.328
For all my family.

41:16.912 --> 41:18.980
Goodbye...

41:20.949 --> 41:22.984
...Mother.

41:47.976 --> 41:51.479
Is this where I am to sleep
for eternity?

41:51.547 --> 41:53.481
What did you expect?

41:53.549 --> 41:56.317
Pomp and glory?

41:56.385 --> 41:58.486
Kneel.

42:08.564 --> 42:10.498
What?

42:10.566 --> 42:13.634
I thought
that she would come.

42:16.572 --> 42:18.606
Kneel.

42:38.060 --> 42:40.928
There is no God.

43:00.649 --> 43:03.217
I know
you killed my mother.

43:05.687 --> 43:08.790
Your nun confessed to it,
but she had no motive.

43:14.530 --> 43:16.964
She stood before
the executioner's sword

43:17.032 --> 43:20.701
as if she were
your champion.

43:20.769 --> 43:24.539
My protection
of your castle is at an end.

43:24.606 --> 43:26.441
And this--

43:28.410 --> 43:31.546
this belongs
to your king!

43:31.613 --> 43:35.483
As does the name Pendragon,
which I also strip from you.

43:37.419 --> 43:40.588
You no longer have the right
to call yourself that.

43:43.559 --> 43:46.227
And I no longer have
a sister.

43:46.295 --> 43:49.697
That name is
my birthright.

43:49.765 --> 43:53.267
You have no rights
in this kingdom anymore.

43:53.335 --> 43:56.237
You will not
take my name!

43:56.305 --> 43:57.872
You hear me?!

43:57.940 --> 43:59.907
ARTHUR!

43:59.975 --> 44:01.809
I AM PENDRAGON!

44:01.877 --> 44:03.578
YOU ARE NOTHING!

44:03.645 --> 44:07.048
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE NOTHING
BUT MY FATHER'S BASTARD!

45:22.691 --> 45:24.759
I never said goodbye.

45:27.863 --> 45:31.132
I never had the chance
to say how much he meant to me.

45:31.199 --> 45:34.435
He drew his last breath
thinking of you.

46:33.295 --> 46:35.696
Those we hold
in our hearts

46:35.764 --> 46:37.865
we never say goodbye to.

46:44.473 --> 46:46.941
This seat belongs
to Leontes.

46:47.009 --> 46:50.375
It remains empty
until a champion as true and

46:50.400 --> 46:52.117
a man as honourable joins us.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.882
It'll remain cold
for all time.

46:54.950 --> 46:57.818
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

47:00.088 --> 47:01.656
For Leontes.

47:08.430 --> 47:12.066
For Leontes!

47:29.217 --> 47:31.452
I never thanked you.

47:31.520 --> 47:34.955
After all this,
you want to thank me?

47:35.023 --> 47:37.792
You gave me parents
and a brother,

47:37.859 --> 47:41.462
all of whom loved me
despite myself.

47:41.530 --> 47:43.289
I'm more than
I could ever have been,

47:43.314 --> 47:44.794
and I'm only just beginning.

47:45.867 --> 47:49.437
Arthur... I'm leaving.

47:49.504 --> 47:52.106
You can't.

47:52.107 --> 47:53.155
I have to.

47:53.161 --> 47:55.991
No. This began with you.
You stay and you see it through.

47:56.111 --> 47:58.245
- It's cost me too much.
- It's cost all of us!

47:58.313 --> 48:02.450
That's why we can't stop!
Let me go, Arthur.

48:02.517 --> 48:05.086
If it was the other way
around, you wouldn't let me go.

48:05.153 --> 48:07.388
Maybe you're stronger
than me.

48:09.357 --> 48:11.892
And maybe that's
what I didn't know.

48:16.565 --> 48:18.165
Will you come back?

48:27.309 --> 48:29.443
You...

48:29.511 --> 48:31.545
...will be great.

49:02.544 --> 49:04.512
I'm sorry.

49:07.482 --> 49:10.117
What do I do now?

49:10.185 --> 49:12.219
Help me.

49:18.660 --> 49:22.296
<i>To be queen...</i>

49:22.364 --> 49:26.100
<i>...you must give birth...</i>

49:26.168 --> 49:28.736
<i>...to a king.</i>

49:50.892 --> 49:54.161
I know it's wrong...

49:54.229 --> 49:56.964
...but I don't think
I can be alone tonight.

50:01.937 --> 50:03.971
Guinevere...

50:07.609 --> 50:09.677
Just tonight.

50:39.774 --> 50:42.877
He told me
to treasure you.

50:44.779 --> 50:46.847
Then do.
