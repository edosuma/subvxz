WEBVTT

04:11.486 --> 04:12.904
Two rooms.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.614
You only have two customers.

04:14.697 --> 04:16.031
Slow season.

04:16.115 --> 04:17.992
Well, how do you make a living?

04:18.076 --> 04:19.744
Low overhead.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.411
Occasional opportunity.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.872
The "occasional opportunity"?

04:22.956 --> 04:24.832
You know, where
you’re standing,

04:24.916 --> 04:27.043
that’s for employees only.

04:27.126 --> 04:28.836
Oh.

04:28.920 --> 04:29.921
Pardon.

04:32.799 --> 04:34.008
Bad neighborhood.

04:34.092 --> 04:35.134
Yeah, it must be.

04:35.218 --> 04:36.386
Shotgun and...

04:38.930 --> 04:40.932
whatever you’ve
got underneath your shirt.

04:50.817 --> 04:51.985
All right.

05:02.912 --> 05:06.499
You guys took your time
circling around...

05:06.582 --> 05:08.126
Yeah, we had to drive
about half a mile

05:08.209 --> 05:09.168
send your picture,

05:09.252 --> 05:13.131
you know,
get confirmation.

05:13.214 --> 05:14.257
Internet sucks.

05:14.340 --> 05:16.634
Should have come in.
Got free Wi-Fi.

05:29.731 --> 05:31.149
How long you had this place?

05:31.232 --> 05:32.525
About a year.

05:32.608 --> 05:34.193
Friend of mine
left it to me.

05:34.277 --> 05:36.237
What we hear,
you don’t have any friends.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.073
Not anymore.

05:39.157 --> 05:40.700
Standing still for a year,

05:40.783 --> 05:42.744
you had to know that
was gonna be too long.

05:45.538 --> 05:47.498
I had obligations, and...

05:50.209 --> 05:52.003
you get tired.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.713
That’s something you
should have thought about

05:55.131 --> 05:56.049
in the first place.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.342
You know the story?

05:58.426 --> 06:00.344
We don’t give a shit
about the story.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.679
We hear lots of stories.

06:01.763 --> 06:05.016
See, he’s not gonna
appreciate it, but you might.

06:08.102 --> 06:12.023
A short one, yeah, sure.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.524
Buy you a beer.

06:13.608 --> 06:15.359
You can cut me off
if you get bored.

06:16.861 --> 06:18.488
Me and Franco...

08:16.647 --> 08:17.982
Hey.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.734
On the way,
inside an hour.

08:21.611 --> 08:23.446
Okay.

08:23.529 --> 08:24.530
Hey, you good?

08:26.032 --> 08:27.742
You know anything
about rice cookers?

08:27.825 --> 08:28.826
What?

08:28.910 --> 08:31.162
They come in a travel size.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.663
Think it’s over-priced, though.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.457
What? You want me to do some
research on rice cookers?

08:35.541 --> 08:37.835
Sure.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.756
You know what?
Nah, I’ll do my own research.

08:41.839 --> 08:43.591
You know what?
Tell me what you find out.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.344
Jesus, you need to get laid.

08:46.427 --> 08:47.845
Who says I don’t get laid?

09:35.393 --> 09:36.602
Hey, Dad.

09:36.686 --> 09:37.728
Hey.

09:37.812 --> 09:39.355
What do you know
about rice cookers?

09:39.438 --> 09:40.398
Not much.

09:40.481 --> 09:42.858
I’m thinking about getting one.

09:42.942 --> 09:44.151
Why?

09:44.235 --> 09:47.363
I travel a lot.
I eat a lot of rice.

09:47.446 --> 09:48.906
Is rice expensive?

09:48.990 --> 09:50.408
Almost never.

09:50.491 --> 09:51.492
So...

09:53.035 --> 09:54.578
You’re smart.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.330
You’re a smart young woman.

09:56.414 --> 09:57.832
Something only
a dad would say.

09:57.915 --> 09:59.792
Well, I’m sure.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.586
I’m sure you U Penn
would disagree, right?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.839
Grades are fine
and I got the check.

10:04.922 --> 10:06.007
Thank you.

10:06.090 --> 10:08.050
Didn’t seem like much.

10:08.134 --> 10:10.970
Tuition’s covered and
I work at the lab a few nights.

10:11.053 --> 10:12.346
Should you be working?

10:12.430 --> 10:14.015
I mean, shouldn’t you
be focused on...

10:14.098 --> 10:15.474
Mom worked through college.

10:15.558 --> 10:18.144
She’d have wanted it to
be easier for you.

10:18.227 --> 10:20.354
I’d rather it wasn’t
too easy, you know?

10:21.647 --> 10:22.648
True.

10:24.650 --> 10:26.777
I don’t know what
your schedule is like,

10:26.861 --> 10:29.488
but I’ve got a
break coming up.

10:29.572 --> 10:30.948
Yeah, yeah.

10:31.032 --> 10:34.577
Um... yeah, uh-huh.

10:37.747 --> 10:38.664
Yeah, right.

10:38.748 --> 10:41.167
Look, I know...

10:41.250 --> 10:44.628
What did I do, Dad?
Why can’t I see you?

10:44.712 --> 10:47.256
No, you didn’t do anything.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.507
Five years.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.011
It’s been five years.

10:54.847 --> 10:56.098
Someday I’m gonna tell
you the reason

10:56.182 --> 10:57.516
and you’ll wish I hadn’t.

10:59.185 --> 11:02.396
Jesus! What am I supposed
to do with that?

11:03.689 --> 11:06.108
This isn’t normal!
The money--

11:06.192 --> 11:08.027
The money’s what
I’ve got right now.

11:14.950 --> 11:16.452
Look, I’ve gotta get
back to work.

11:19.163 --> 11:20.164
I love you.

11:22.666 --> 11:24.543
I love you too, Dad.

12:26.355 --> 12:29.024
All right, I’ll buy you
the fuckin’ rice cooker.

12:29.108 --> 12:31.026
Rifle on the other side
of the hot zone.

12:32.194 --> 12:34.530
Two UFOs sitting in a car.

12:34.613 --> 12:36.157
Well, maybe the object.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.159
Without an advance security,
I don’t know.

12:38.242 --> 12:39.410
Maybe police?

12:39.493 --> 12:41.954
No. No, the police
have been managed.

12:42.037 --> 12:43.247
It is definitely
not the police.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.832
-You sure?
-No, no.

12:44.915 --> 12:46.542
I’m an asshole
who hasn’t kept you alive

12:46.625 --> 12:47.793
and safe for 10 years.

12:47.877 --> 12:49.211
Right down this plate.

12:49.295 --> 12:52.590
78AJUG.

12:52.673 --> 12:54.258
78AUG.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.886
78AJUG.

12:56.969 --> 12:58.762
Take this fuckin’ seriously.

13:00.514 --> 13:01.640
What the fuck...

13:01.724 --> 13:02.558
What?

13:02.641 --> 13:04.101
Call me back.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.201
Hey!

14:03.911 --> 14:05.663
Two is better than one, honey.

14:05.746 --> 14:07.957
Do I make her...
Do I make you nervous?

14:09.083 --> 14:10.626
No, baby, not at all.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.628
No one’s nervous.

14:12.711 --> 14:14.922
Just thought you might want
a little taste of home.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.555
How you end up down here?

14:22.638 --> 14:24.348
There’s a story there.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.683
Story’s not as sad
as you’re thinking.

14:25.766 --> 14:27.977
Not as different from mine
as you’re thinking.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.603
Which is why I can’t
have you come up here

14:29.687 --> 14:31.146
and make me fall
in love with you.

14:32.898 --> 14:33.899
Go.

14:54.795 --> 14:55.754
It’s unlocked!

15:02.678 --> 15:04.471
Okay if I turn on a light?

15:04.555 --> 15:05.723
No.

15:06.724 --> 15:07.725
Okay.

15:14.898 --> 15:16.275
Hey.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.445
Walk over to that window.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.541
Take off your top.

15:51.185 --> 15:52.353
Anything under the skirt?

16:00.653 --> 16:02.905
That’s good.

16:02.988 --> 16:03.989
Now open the blinds.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.955
It’s a blue Skoda.
See it?

16:16.835 --> 16:18.087
They’re gone, baby.

16:26.428 --> 16:27.971
You know them?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.306
Keep looking out the window.

16:31.016 --> 16:32.559
They cops?

16:32.643 --> 16:34.895
-No.
-How do you know?

16:34.978 --> 16:37.898
I just gave the mean
one a blow job.

16:37.981 --> 16:40.234
That makes them not a cop?

16:40.317 --> 16:41.568
He paid.

16:42.820 --> 16:45.155
They have guns?

16:45.239 --> 16:46.448
I didn’t see.

16:46.532 --> 16:48.283
They’re the type that might?

16:48.367 --> 16:49.743
Yeah.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.457
Are you jerking off?

16:57.376 --> 16:58.377
Maybe.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.716
The roof across the street,
the one with the construction.

17:03.799 --> 17:04.967
You see it?

17:06.218 --> 17:07.261
Yeah.

17:07.344 --> 17:09.137
Can you get up there?

17:09.221 --> 17:10.848
Yeah, but it’s empty.
It’s an empty building.

17:10.931 --> 17:12.808
Nah, my friend’s up there.
He’s working late.

17:12.891 --> 17:14.393
Close the blinds.

17:14.476 --> 17:16.645
Put your clothes back on.

17:16.729 --> 17:19.147
So you really don’t wanna fuck?

17:19.231 --> 17:22.067
No, not since
my daughter was 14.

17:22.151 --> 17:23.694
You have a phone?

17:23.777 --> 17:26.070
-Here.
-All right.

17:26.155 --> 17:28.866
I want you to go up on the roof
and say hello to Mr. Sanchez.

17:28.949 --> 17:31.785
Whatever he wants, it’s on me.

17:31.869 --> 17:33.537
Like a joke?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.706
Yeah.
Yeah, like a joke.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.376
After, you can have the rest.

17:41.295 --> 17:42.296
Okay.

17:44.548 --> 17:45.716
Thank you.

17:47.050 --> 17:48.343
Bye.

18:01.857 --> 18:04.109
Blue Skoda.
It’s a rental.

18:04.193 --> 18:06.028
Got a couple names, but
they won’t mean shit to you

18:06.111 --> 18:08.447
because they don’t
mean shit to me.

18:08.530 --> 18:10.532
-American?
-Out of Miami.

18:10.616 --> 18:13.494
You got a bad feeling about
this, get the fuck out.

18:13.577 --> 18:15.412
I leave without knowing what
the fuck is going on,

18:15.496 --> 18:17.414
then I don’t know what
the fuck is going on.

18:18.582 --> 18:20.959
-Who else is down here?
-What do you mean?

18:21.043 --> 18:22.878
Other tradesmen.
Who’s active here?

18:22.961 --> 18:24.713
Well, shit. You know,
let me check Facebook.

18:24.797 --> 18:26.048
None of yours?

18:26.131 --> 18:27.591
You know I would
have mentioned it.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.426
Would you?

18:29.510 --> 18:31.178
Probably not,
but I’m telling you...

18:37.267 --> 18:38.101
Hello?

18:38.185 --> 18:40.687
Let me say hello to my friend.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.398
It’s for you.

18:43.482 --> 18:45.651
No way.
No way you saw me.

18:45.734 --> 18:48.153
I recognized your
puke green MSR.

18:49.947 --> 18:52.533
You supposed to do me before
or after I take the shot?

18:52.616 --> 18:54.076
Kind of a moot point now.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.748
Come on, Sanchez.

19:03.168 --> 19:06.088
Tits at the window was a
good fuckin’ move, man.

19:06.171 --> 19:08.632
But I’m always
improving on you.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.843
You don’t think I’d shoot you
right through her?

19:12.344 --> 19:15.639
I’m the one person in the
world that knows you won’t.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.683
One chance. Come over.
I’ll buy you a beer.

19:17.766 --> 19:19.351
Nah. I don’t drink, Viejo.

19:32.072 --> 19:34.449
Shit, Viejo.
You shoulda took the shot.

19:36.410 --> 19:37.870
She’s dead anyway.

19:37.953 --> 19:40.539
But you always did leave
the dirty work for me.

20:28.503 --> 20:30.172
Nah... not like that, Viejo.

20:34.092 --> 20:35.052
So what now?

20:35.135 --> 20:36.345
Window maybe?

20:38.138 --> 20:40.557
You go for the door?

20:40.641 --> 20:41.850
I got all day while you
move the dresser.

20:53.445 --> 20:55.489
Start running, you
double-dealing fuck.

20:55.572 --> 20:57.407
From what? You?

20:57.491 --> 20:59.117
You can’t make a decision
about a fuckin’ rice cooker.

20:59.201 --> 21:00.702
Well, that’s why you
tipped the target

21:00.786 --> 21:03.121
and sold them Sanchez
to double on me?

21:03.205 --> 21:05.624
You’re the target,
you asshole.

21:13.048 --> 21:13.882
Who?

21:13.966 --> 21:15.717
I never ask. You know that.

21:15.801 --> 21:16.927
It was money.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.553
And you’re past
your sell-by date.

21:18.637 --> 21:20.764
You don’t fuck anymore,
you don’t drink,

21:20.847 --> 21:22.516
I would have walked away.

21:22.599 --> 21:24.643
You should have
let me walk away.

21:24.726 --> 21:26.353
You try and then a
year or two later,

21:26.436 --> 21:30.232
the pangs of conscience get
worse and worse and worse.

21:30.315 --> 21:33.151
You know it, and then you
go off and tell someone!

21:33.235 --> 21:37.030
Yeah? Yeah? Well, you shoulda
taken a chance, Dean, now, now--

21:37.114 --> 21:38.573
Now, now, now what?

21:38.657 --> 21:39.908
If you make it outta
that room,

21:39.992 --> 21:41.368
you’d better
fuckin’ ghost.

21:41.451 --> 21:43.036
Because the day
you’re spotted,

21:43.120 --> 21:45.872
someone goes to U Penn
to the Ridgeman Dorms.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.290
And then God
knows what’s gonna--

21:47.374 --> 21:50.502
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Dean!

21:52.129 --> 21:53.797
Fuck you!

22:45.098 --> 22:46.016
Dad...

22:46.099 --> 22:47.309
Hey.

22:47.392 --> 22:48.310
I’m sorry.

22:48.393 --> 22:49.603
Oh, don’t apologize.

22:49.686 --> 22:52.189
You have nothing
to apologize for.

22:57.778 --> 23:00.280
You grew up so well,
I just figured being around

23:00.363 --> 23:03.784
would’ve fucked things up.

23:03.867 --> 23:05.911
But maybe I fucked
up anyway, yeah.

23:08.330 --> 23:13.251
Maybe there’s just
no right answer, no.

23:13.335 --> 23:15.337
I know you love me.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.339
I know you’re doing your best.

23:20.175 --> 23:23.386
I am. I did.
I am doing my best.

23:31.895 --> 23:33.980
I just, um...

23:36.608 --> 23:38.235
I just want us to be good.

23:40.695 --> 23:42.239
We’re great, Dad.

23:45.617 --> 23:46.701
Okay, then.

23:48.578 --> 23:51.706
Okay, Dad, goodnight.

23:51.790 --> 23:52.874
Goodnight.

25:07.490 --> 25:08.742
Tell me it’s done.

25:08.825 --> 25:10.452
Yes, sir.

25:10.535 --> 25:13.288
You all right? I know
the two of you had history.

25:13.371 --> 25:16.875
Oh, that was years ago,
not that it wasn’t weird.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.710
Someday you’ll do the
same to me, right?

25:18.793 --> 25:20.378
Not if you’re smarter
than he was.

25:20.462 --> 25:22.130
Should be a red Renault.

25:22.214 --> 25:23.465
Up on blocks?

25:23.548 --> 25:25.091
No one steals a stripped car.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.509
Payment is in the shifter box.

26:08.718 --> 26:09.552
Problem?

26:09.636 --> 26:10.762
No, they’re here.

26:10.845 --> 26:12.264
Hey, man, you sure
about this shit?

26:12.347 --> 26:15.433
I got GIA certificates.
Don’t worry.

26:15.517 --> 26:17.060
What... what are
GIA certificates?

26:17.143 --> 26:19.813
It means the diamonds
are legit.

26:19.896 --> 26:21.273
It’s how the client
wanted to pay.

26:21.356 --> 26:23.900
The guy in Panama is set
to convert them for you.

26:23.984 --> 26:26.278
Killing this phone now.
Talk to you in a month.

26:52.345 --> 26:53.638
Hands, fuckface!

26:57.934 --> 26:59.060
Yeah.

27:13.450 --> 27:14.701
Hey.

27:14.784 --> 27:16.494
Hey, come on, man.
Stripping a stripped car?

27:16.578 --> 27:18.079
Doesn’t make sense.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.166
Ah, fuck!

27:22.459 --> 27:23.752
Try me.

27:23.835 --> 27:25.086
-All right.
-You fuckin’ angry?

27:29.466 --> 27:30.925
And I believe
he intended to shoot you.

27:31.009 --> 27:32.802
Looked that way, didn’t it?

28:09.547 --> 28:10.840
Who gave me up?

28:19.808 --> 28:22.018
All right, that’s good.
It’s a good sign.

28:22.102 --> 28:24.104
Yeah?

28:24.187 --> 28:25.522
If you were gonna dump me
on the side of the road,

28:25.605 --> 28:27.524
you’d tell me, right?

28:27.607 --> 28:28.441
Unless...

28:28.525 --> 28:30.318
You can shut up now.

28:30.402 --> 28:34.280
Oh, shit. I see.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.991
It’s G-Man’s snitch and
he doesn’t trust you.

29:06.729 --> 29:07.897
Hey, man, seriously, man.

29:07.981 --> 29:10.525
How long we been
working together, man?

29:10.608 --> 29:12.694
You still can’t speak
decent fuckin’ Spanish?

29:12.777 --> 29:15.947
I know enough to know
when I’m being rat-fucked.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.282
Hey, I don’t give
a shit which one of you

29:17.365 --> 29:19.659
I make a deal with, all right?

29:30.336 --> 29:32.797
Oh, motherfucker!
That was a good one!

29:32.881 --> 29:34.841
You want me to shut
the fuck up, buddy?

29:34.924 --> 29:36.551
You’re gonna have to
hit me harder than that.

29:36.634 --> 29:38.386
That’s just turning me on.

29:53.568 --> 29:54.694
Jesus, Miguel...

29:58.281 --> 30:01.784
Miguel... you’re just
encouraging him!

30:01.868 --> 30:03.453
It’s a long fucking
ride, you know.

30:03.536 --> 30:04.579
It keeps me awake.

30:04.662 --> 30:06.331
Oh, yeah?
Long ride to where?

30:07.916 --> 30:09.167
Huh?

30:14.422 --> 30:15.798
Where we going?

30:34.150 --> 30:38.029
Look, the diamonds
are worth 250.

30:38.112 --> 30:39.447
First one of you
kills the other,

30:39.531 --> 30:41.366
I’ll bump it another 250.

30:41.449 --> 30:44.494
That’s 375 more than
either of you is expecting.

30:46.663 --> 30:48.164
You know I’m good for it.

30:52.126 --> 30:53.503
I got it.

30:55.797 --> 30:58.258
Oh, shit, look.
He’s thinking about it.

30:58.341 --> 31:00.593
You better act fast. Your man,
he’s thinking about it.

31:00.677 --> 31:05.932
’Cause he’s gonna trust a greasy
piece of shit like you, hmm?

31:06.015 --> 31:07.100
Oh!

31:12.230 --> 31:14.107
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

31:14.190 --> 31:15.358
Hey, man, come on.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.527
This making you
fuckin’ feel better? Relax.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.863
Fuckin’ relax.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.323
I’m relaxed.

31:22.407 --> 31:24.367
Hey, you know what?
G-Man is trying to figure out

31:24.450 --> 31:25.952
how to fuckin’ shoot you
from the back seat...

31:26.035 --> 31:28.162
Just pull over, man.
Let me break his jaw.

31:28.246 --> 31:29.372
It’s just words, man.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.832
What the fuck you
care about words?

31:33.626 --> 31:36.504
Pull over. Let me break
his fuckin’ jaw!

31:36.588 --> 31:39.799
500! 500! 500!
Just get this shit movin’!

31:39.882 --> 31:41.134
Just get--

32:03.364 --> 32:04.365
What?

32:05.867 --> 32:10.246
Now we’re riding around
with a dead fuckin’ body, man.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.332
It’s not the first time.

32:12.415 --> 32:13.416
Pull over. We’ll throw
him in the trunk.

32:13.499 --> 32:14.417
Clean up a little.

32:33.394 --> 32:34.604
Quit fucking with me.

32:40.652 --> 32:45.031
Seriously, how much money
have we made together?

32:45.114 --> 32:47.659
Not this much, man.
Not all at once.

32:47.742 --> 32:49.077
Fuck you, man, fuck you.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.412
Exactly. That’s what
I’m afraid of, man.

32:51.496 --> 32:52.872
Exactly that.

32:57.126 --> 32:59.462
So, what?
What’s the plan here?

32:59.545 --> 33:00.922
You just gonna drive
around all night?

33:05.051 --> 33:06.886
This car doesn’t
run outta gas?

33:12.767 --> 33:14.143
You know what?
It’s okay, man.

33:14.227 --> 33:17.188
Just empty your fuckin’ gun
and it’s fine. It’s fine.

33:18.690 --> 33:20.566
Empty?

33:20.650 --> 33:21.776
You fucking kidding me?

33:26.739 --> 33:29.325
I’m not fucking
kidding you, motherfucker!

33:36.249 --> 33:37.458
You know we’re
through after this.

33:38.835 --> 33:40.378
Yeah, Lance, I fuckin’ know.

33:47.885 --> 33:49.220
No.

33:49.303 --> 33:50.722
I’ll fuckin’ shoot you, Lance.

33:50.805 --> 33:52.306
-You’re gonna anyway.
-No, I’m not.

33:52.390 --> 33:53.433
Then unload your gun.

33:53.516 --> 33:54.809
I’m not fuckin’ doing that.
You crazy?

33:54.892 --> 33:57.228
’Cause I can trust you,
but you can’t trust me?

33:57.311 --> 33:58.938
Well, you shot the
fucking guy, man--

33:59.021 --> 34:02.650
Because he was getting
in our heads!

34:02.734 --> 34:04.068
He got us here!

34:08.322 --> 34:09.449
Well, Lance...

34:11.743 --> 34:12.744
Here we are.

34:15.830 --> 34:16.831
Partner?

34:20.126 --> 34:21.252
Yeah.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.590
Here we are.

34:30.928 --> 34:31.929
Okay, man.

34:50.114 --> 34:51.114
Fuck!

35:25.733 --> 35:26.901
That’s it.

35:45.336 --> 35:47.171
Tell me you’re not
gonna run, partner?

35:53.177 --> 35:54.595
Not while I got the diamonds!

36:54.280 --> 36:55.364
Sorry, Miguel.

37:28.731 --> 37:29.732
Agh!

37:46.958 --> 37:49.085
Open the kit.
See what we got.

37:50.211 --> 37:51.295
Not a lot.

37:51.379 --> 37:53.130
Well, do what you can.

37:53.214 --> 37:54.590
We gotta figure out a story.

37:56.509 --> 37:57.385
What happened?

37:58.594 --> 37:59.971
It...

38:04.183 --> 38:05.393
...got a little messy.

38:05.476 --> 38:06.727
Oh, Lance.

38:08.145 --> 38:10.231
Oh, we’re okay, we’re okay.

38:12.483 --> 38:13.609
He shot me.

38:15.569 --> 38:18.531
Not through and through, is it?

38:18.614 --> 38:20.074
The bullet come out
the other side?

38:20.157 --> 38:20.992
Is there a hole?

38:21.075 --> 38:22.076
No.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.685
Right on the money, huh?

38:49.228 --> 38:50.980
My man was right on the money.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.234
And all it cost was
a little part of my soul,

38:55.317 --> 38:56.944
the part I wasn’t using.

39:00.573 --> 39:02.283
Miguel was bad,
bad as me...

39:04.410 --> 39:05.995
but I shouldn’t
have shot him.

39:08.039 --> 39:09.415
You killed him for me.

39:14.253 --> 39:15.713
He didn’t give me a choice.

39:15.796 --> 39:20.009
But if I’m being honest,
I knew he wouldn’t.

39:22.178 --> 39:25.181
Even if he knew why,
I needed it all.

39:25.264 --> 39:26.766
I think I would
have been better if I--

39:26.849 --> 39:28.017
No.

39:29.852 --> 39:31.312
Nothing is better than this.

39:33.397 --> 39:36.567
Yeah? Yeah?

39:42.573 --> 39:46.577
Listen to me, Arana’s
meeting us at Hotel del Franco

39:46.660 --> 39:48.454
with a new passport
and papers.

39:48.537 --> 39:51.415
Get you on the plane to Bonn.

39:51.499 --> 39:54.460
I come by with a
new passport in a week,

39:54.543 --> 39:56.170
new identities
for both of us.

39:59.090 --> 40:00.091
Then...

40:01.092 --> 40:02.259
Then?

40:05.137 --> 40:07.431
It’s fucking happening.

40:07.515 --> 40:11.477
A year, but
it’s happening.

40:20.945 --> 40:22.822
There’s no way she could
have followed me here.

40:22.905 --> 40:27.618
Puta! I’m not going to kill you!
I love you!

40:27.701 --> 40:29.120
Fucking love you!

40:43.259 --> 40:45.886
Arana gets the biggest diamond.
That’s his payment. Got it?

40:45.970 --> 40:47.680
We are doing this together.

40:47.763 --> 40:48.764
Please!

40:48.848 --> 40:49.974
I’ll meet you at the hotel.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.063
Hey, Ericson!

40:56.147 --> 40:58.065
You think being a
cop protects you?

40:59.150 --> 41:01.527
You think being
an American protects you?

41:02.695 --> 41:04.613
You fucked my woman!

41:04.697 --> 41:06.282
I’m gonna fucking kill you!

41:20.129 --> 41:21.255
Go. Go!

41:45.863 --> 41:47.364
Come out...

46:14.381 --> 46:16.049
Street. One night.

46:17.843 --> 46:20.387
I’m supposed to ask for ID
and a credit card.

46:27.478 --> 46:28.479
Okay.

46:50.542 --> 46:51.502
If you need anything...

46:51.585 --> 46:52.836
You here all night?

46:52.920 --> 46:57.090
I was gonna say, "Dial 00."
Yes, I am.

47:57.901 --> 48:01.029
Bourbon and tequila
and bourbon.

48:01.113 --> 48:03.699
And beer.

48:03.782 --> 48:06.952
Tequila and beer.

48:09.871 --> 48:11.290
Thought you were the clerk.

48:13.125 --> 48:15.836
Clerk, bartender,

48:15.919 --> 48:18.880
security guard, owner.

48:18.964 --> 48:20.507
Owner? What happened to Franco?

48:20.591 --> 48:22.384
You know Franco?

48:22.467 --> 48:24.469
No. I read the sign.

48:24.553 --> 48:26.888
I won this place
in a poker game.

48:26.972 --> 48:28.515
Really?

48:28.599 --> 48:32.686
It was a long game and it turns
out it’s not worth that much.

48:41.528 --> 48:42.904
Is that why you do
everything yourself?

48:42.988 --> 48:45.115
I have people during the day.
At night, though...

48:45.198 --> 48:46.575
You like the quiet?

48:46.658 --> 48:48.869
I don’t get
much sleep anyway.

48:48.952 --> 48:49.870
Bad dreams?

48:49.953 --> 48:51.038
What makes you say that?

48:53.707 --> 48:55.125
Everyone has bad dreams.

48:59.713 --> 49:02.090
That’s not your real answer.

49:02.174 --> 49:03.675
That’s what you came up
with right after

49:03.759 --> 49:06.094
you wished you hadn’t
asked the question.

49:06.178 --> 49:08.221
You talk to all your hotel
guests like this?

49:17.481 --> 49:18.940
You know a man named Arana?

49:23.945 --> 49:25.822
Spanish for "spider", right?

49:25.906 --> 49:28.033
I don’t know him. I’m supposed
to be meeting him here.

49:28.116 --> 49:30.285
Meeting a guy named Arana?

49:30.369 --> 49:31.787
Nothing good can come of that.

49:31.870 --> 49:35.040
You mean, a woman like me
meeting a guy named Arana?

49:35.123 --> 49:37.125
Well, I think you’ve met some
Aranas in your time,

49:37.209 --> 49:39.211
probably some Snakes
and Lobos too.

49:39.294 --> 49:40.796
What makes you say that?

49:40.879 --> 49:45.008
Just... the way you drink,
how nervous you are...

49:47.719 --> 49:49.137
How nervous you’re not.

49:55.227 --> 49:56.645
Franco’s dead, isn’t he?

49:59.272 --> 50:01.233
The back of your neck,
that scar’s from a knife.

50:01.316 --> 50:04.027
The one on your hand,
that’s from a bullet.

50:04.111 --> 50:07.072
Maybe I had one
really bad day.

50:07.155 --> 50:09.783
You have the eyes and
the hands of a violent man.

50:10.992 --> 50:13.787
I know, because
I know violent men.

50:13.870 --> 50:16.289
So the questions are...

50:16.373 --> 50:18.667
did Franco die by
your hand and why?

50:22.838 --> 50:24.339
And does a violent man
really think

50:24.423 --> 50:27.134
he’s gonna find peace
behind a hotel desk?

50:29.636 --> 50:30.929
What are the answers?

50:32.389 --> 50:34.015
Those aren’t my questions.

50:42.733 --> 50:43.775
I’ll bill your room.

51:12.262 --> 51:14.181
Your business is
worse than mine.

51:14.264 --> 51:17.350
It’s all about the quality,
not the quantity.

51:17.434 --> 51:20.270
Does it get lonely wandering
around that empty hotel?

51:21.688 --> 51:24.691
I see people walk in,
take one look around

51:24.775 --> 51:26.568
and walk right back out.

51:26.651 --> 51:28.153
Maybe I’m turning them away.

51:28.236 --> 51:29.154
Mm.

51:30.197 --> 51:32.199
Me too.

51:32.282 --> 51:35.076
Only tonight, this guy wanted
to fall in love with me.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.454
There’s always that danger.

51:37.537 --> 51:38.872
Seen Gigi?

51:38.955 --> 51:40.290
Not for a few hours.

51:42.083 --> 51:43.502
She must have
gone home, then.

51:46.087 --> 51:47.672
Guess I’ll do the same.

51:52.886 --> 51:54.513
You know, I see
you almost every night

51:54.596 --> 51:56.640
and steal your cigarettes.

51:56.723 --> 51:58.642
You never once asked me
to throw you one.

51:58.725 --> 52:02.187
And you never once asked me
how I ended up down here.

52:03.563 --> 52:05.065
You never asked me either.

52:05.148 --> 52:06.525
That’s what we like
about each other.

53:41.244 --> 53:42.579
So what’s the pitch?

53:44.915 --> 53:46.249
The pitch?

53:46.333 --> 53:50.170
I’m not delusional enough
to think you find me
irresistible.

53:50.253 --> 53:51.254
No.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.883
You’re a man who understands
the mechanics of this world,

53:54.966 --> 53:56.593
but not its appetites.

53:57.969 --> 53:59.888
It has got me this far.

53:59.971 --> 54:01.598
Would you walk out
of here tonight?

54:01.681 --> 54:03.516
Where would I be walking to?

54:03.600 --> 54:05.977
Would you?
For the right reason?

54:06.061 --> 54:07.520
What’s a right
reason look like?

54:07.604 --> 54:10.065
When you played
cards with Franco

54:10.148 --> 54:11.983
and he put the deed
down to this place,

54:12.067 --> 54:13.652
what gave it value to you?

54:13.735 --> 54:15.028
Money, pleasure?

54:15.111 --> 54:16.488
So we’re not
discussing reasons.

54:16.571 --> 54:17.739
We’re negotiating payment.

54:17.822 --> 54:19.199
Would you prefer a cause?

54:19.282 --> 54:20.992
You don’t strike me
as a cause.

54:23.787 --> 54:26.790
More of a rabbit hole.

54:26.873 --> 54:27.958
A rabbit hole.

54:28.041 --> 54:29.584
I fall into you
knowing full well

54:29.668 --> 54:31.586
there’s going to be
a hard landing.

54:33.672 --> 54:37.258
I’m getting out of a
difficult situation,

54:37.342 --> 54:38.718
becoming a new person,

54:40.261 --> 54:42.138
a person I thought
I would have been by now.

54:42.222 --> 54:44.474
Arana is giving you
a new identity,

54:44.557 --> 54:47.102
way out of the city?
The country?

54:47.185 --> 54:49.145
It has to be quickly, tonight.

54:49.229 --> 54:50.897
Because you’re using
someone else’s money.

54:50.981 --> 54:53.316
-I don’t see it that way.
-But someone does.

54:54.693 --> 54:55.777
You’re right.

54:55.860 --> 54:57.779
I’ve known Aranas and Snakes.

54:57.862 --> 54:59.531
I know how to handle them.

54:59.614 --> 55:01.491
But they don’t know
that at first.

55:01.574 --> 55:04.244
At first, it’s easier
to have someone like me around

55:04.327 --> 55:06.079
to deal with
the Snakes and Aranas.

55:06.162 --> 55:09.708
But you couldn’t have planned
for that, for me being here.

55:09.791 --> 55:12.127
A plan is just an action
that you sit and contemplate

55:12.210 --> 55:14.004
for so long that it
becomes complicated.

55:14.087 --> 55:16.923
I’d rather move from
opportunity to opportunity.

55:19.092 --> 55:22.512
I saw your knuckles,
your scars.

55:22.595 --> 55:25.598
And I recognized
an opportunity,

55:25.682 --> 55:27.058
same as you saw in me.

55:31.604 --> 55:33.189
I’m not the guy
you think I am.

55:33.273 --> 55:34.733
You don’t want to be,
but you are.

55:34.816 --> 55:36.609
If I could go,
I would, but I can’t.

55:37.777 --> 55:39.529
Can’t or won’t?

55:39.612 --> 55:41.906
You think I’d say no to you
if I had the choice?

55:41.990 --> 55:43.033
Well, it seems like you are.

55:43.116 --> 55:44.492
It really is can’t.

55:44.576 --> 55:48.496
Though I don’t like my chances
with you... or her.

56:04.220 --> 56:05.263
She’ll kill me.

56:05.346 --> 56:08.641
And me, if she smells
your perfume.

56:08.725 --> 56:11.269
Behind the staircase, there’s
an exit out into the alley.

56:11.352 --> 56:12.812
I have to go back
to my room first.

56:12.896 --> 56:14.397
For money you
don’t think is hers?

56:15.648 --> 56:17.692
It’s worth way
more than this hotel,

56:17.776 --> 56:19.569
way more than
what Franco died for.

56:45.512 --> 56:47.680
That’s not gonna make
me move any faster!

56:52.644 --> 56:54.062
All right, all right.

56:57.732 --> 56:58.900
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

56:58.983 --> 57:00.318
Don’t shoot, don’t shoot,
please.

57:00.401 --> 57:02.570
-Oso!
-Sorry. Don’t shoot.

57:11.621 --> 57:12.622
I’m sorry.

57:21.965 --> 57:23.258
This was Franco’s place.

57:25.426 --> 57:27.637
Yeah, he sold it to me.

57:31.224 --> 57:32.934
When was that?

57:33.017 --> 57:37.564
Uh, about a week
before he disappeared.

57:38.606 --> 57:40.608
You got proof?

57:40.692 --> 57:42.152
You need it?

57:47.740 --> 57:49.450
Do you know who I am?

57:49.534 --> 57:53.037
Not specifically,
but you are a type.

57:55.123 --> 57:57.125
I am a type.

57:57.208 --> 57:58.376
Are you a type, too?

57:58.459 --> 58:01.045
Yeah, the kind that doesn’t
want to get shot.

58:01.129 --> 58:04.924
Good, because the
whores may like you,

58:05.008 --> 58:06.134
but they answer to me.

58:07.552 --> 58:10.180
A girl came in traveling light,

58:10.263 --> 58:12.473
probably offered to fuck you
not to tell me she’s here.

58:12.557 --> 58:14.601
Well, now I wish she would
have shown up a little later.

58:17.562 --> 58:20.148
Yeah, Room 27, up
the stairs on the left.

58:21.733 --> 58:23.276
She in?

58:23.359 --> 58:24.736
I don’t know.
I was in my office.

58:24.819 --> 58:26.905
You know, I don’t have
all the answers.

58:53.139 --> 58:54.807
Ola?

58:54.891 --> 58:56.601
Um... Ola?

59:27.840 --> 59:30.426
You could have given her
any key, any goddamn room.

59:30.510 --> 59:32.428
The one with your
suitcase in it.

59:32.512 --> 59:34.055
She’ll sit and wait a while.

59:34.138 --> 59:35.473
Buys you time
to get out of here.

59:35.556 --> 59:37.183
She’ll hunt me down
and kill me.

59:37.267 --> 59:39.227
I don’t think so.

59:39.310 --> 59:41.479
You don’t either.

59:41.562 --> 59:44.232
You think you can talk
your way out of this,

59:44.315 --> 59:45.608
probably have before.

59:45.692 --> 59:49.404
Now the questions are,
should you?

59:49.487 --> 59:51.155
And is your friend worth
more to you than

59:51.239 --> 59:52.573
whatever you stole
from her?

59:54.325 --> 59:55.994
They’re not my questions,
of course.

01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:06.170
You might want to go out
through the alley

01:00:06.254 --> 01:00:08.089
and come back in through
the front.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.508
For appearances sake.

01:00:30.236 --> 01:00:31.446
Mm.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.502
Salud.

01:01:07.899 --> 01:01:09.150
You fuck her?

01:01:13.196 --> 01:01:15.281
Either way, she’s going
to say that you did.

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:16.657
And then?

01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:18.534
We already killed
her lover tonight.

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:30.630
So here we are.

01:01:45.436 --> 01:01:46.813
I wouldn’t be
sitting there too long.

01:01:46.896 --> 01:01:48.689
I was thinking the same thing.

01:01:51.692 --> 01:01:54.028
You think that thumb trick
would work a second time?

01:01:55.863 --> 01:01:57.782
Think it’s the only trick
I know?

01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:10.002
Love.

01:02:15.508 --> 01:02:17.176
Whatever she thinks
will make it stop.

01:02:38.781 --> 01:02:40.199
I wasn’t waiting to start.

01:03:12.815 --> 01:03:13.900
Of course.

01:03:14.984 --> 01:03:16.611
You don’t
mean shit to her.

01:03:16.694 --> 01:03:17.695
You get that, right?

01:03:17.778 --> 01:03:20.323
Not to her.
To you, though.

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:22.700
Do you think you can run
far enough, fast enough?

01:03:22.783 --> 01:03:24.285
I think I’m pretty light
on my feet.

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.621
Not with her hanging
onto your fucking legs!

01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:27.872
What’s the offer?

01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:31.167
What do you want?

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.668
You just made an argument
for killing you.

01:03:32.752 --> 01:03:35.463
Don’t ask me what you
think your fucking
goddamned life is worth.

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:39.592
She took jewelry,
maybe $100,000 in cash,

01:03:39.675 --> 01:03:41.260
hidden here
somewhere for sure.

01:03:41.344 --> 01:03:43.012
Shoot her and it’s
all fucking yours.

01:03:43.095 --> 01:03:44.514
I don’t have
anything against her.

01:03:44.597 --> 01:03:45.973
You don’t have
anything against me either.

01:03:49.227 --> 01:03:51.270
I kind of don’t like you.

01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:52.980
And I did enjoy fucking her.

01:03:56.692 --> 01:04:00.071
Just kill this
fucking bitch so we can
walk out of here, please.

01:04:07.203 --> 01:04:09.705
You picked the wrong
one this time.

01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:10.998
He’s not a killer.

01:04:14.377 --> 01:04:15.211
She’s right.

01:04:15.294 --> 01:04:17.046
Bullshit!

01:04:17.129 --> 01:04:18.381
Because you were looking
at the scars,

01:04:18.464 --> 01:04:19.882
not at the man who
lost the taste for it.

01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:21.759
Now get your purse and
get out of here!

01:04:21.842 --> 01:04:23.678
-And then what?
-She gets a head start.

01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:25.137
And you get what she
stole from me?

01:04:25.221 --> 01:04:26.556
Maybe.
Back up!

01:04:26.639 --> 01:04:27.848
-Fuck, no!
-Fuck, yes!

01:04:27.932 --> 01:04:28.808
No! Fuck, no!

01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:30.643
-Fuck you!
-Fuck, no!

01:04:45.116 --> 01:04:46.826
You fucking bitch!

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:54.083
You bitch.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:38.628
I assumed you had
a gun in your purse.

01:05:39.837 --> 01:05:41.797
I did. I just got
to the knife first.

01:05:41.881 --> 01:05:44.675
We need to get rid of the body.
Bring my car around back.

01:05:44.759 --> 01:05:46.177
Clean up the blood
the best you can.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.928
And then roll her up
in the bedspread.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:49.055
Okay.

01:05:49.138 --> 01:05:50.431
First, though, the money
and the jewelry.

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:52.475
It goes in the safe until
after she’s outta here

01:05:52.558 --> 01:05:54.727
so you don’t get the idea
to leave me with this.

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:56.729
And after?

01:05:56.812 --> 01:05:58.230
I don’t take money
I didn’t earn.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.734
I know it sounds
unlikely but...

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.155
You’re just gonna
have to wait and see.

01:06:10.076 --> 01:06:10.951
And the rest?

01:06:12.495 --> 01:06:14.121
That’s all.

01:06:14.205 --> 01:06:15.915
Except for what you were
gonna pay Arana in your bra

01:06:15.998 --> 01:06:18.876
on your left breast where
you kept me from touching you.

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:22.254
I mean, I’d love to
go looking for it.

01:06:22.338 --> 01:06:23.923
But now’s not the time, is it?

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.527
You might want to clean
yourself up a little too.

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:34.827
Two rooms.

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:36.579
You only have two customers.

01:07:36.662 --> 01:07:37.872
Slow season.

01:07:37.955 --> 01:07:39.832
How do you make a living?

01:07:39.915 --> 01:07:42.543
Low overhead.
Occasional opportunity.

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.003
The "occasional opportunity".

01:07:44.086 --> 01:07:46.380
You know, where you’re standing,
that’s for employees only.

01:07:46.464 --> 01:07:48.048
Oh. Pardon.

01:07:50.384 --> 01:07:51.594
Bad neighborhood.

01:07:51.677 --> 01:07:52.928
Yeah, it must be.

01:07:53.012 --> 01:07:55.222
Shotgun and whatever you
got underneath your shirt.

01:07:59.018 --> 01:08:00.227
All right.

01:08:03.063 --> 01:08:06.358
You guys took your time
circling around...

01:08:06.442 --> 01:08:08.235
Yeah. We had to drive
about half a mile

01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:10.237
to send your picture,
get confirmation.

01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:11.363
Internet sucks.

01:08:11.447 --> 01:08:13.741
Should’ve come in.
Got free Wi-Fi.

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:24.084
How long have
you had this place?

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:25.085
About a year.

01:08:25.169 --> 01:08:26.712
A friend of mine
left it to me.

01:08:26.796 --> 01:08:28.589
Well, we hear you
don’t have any friends.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:29.506
Not anymore.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:31.634
Standing still for a year,

01:08:31.716 --> 01:08:34.303
you had to know that
was gonna be too long.

01:08:34.386 --> 01:08:36.346
I had obligations, and...

01:08:39.058 --> 01:08:40.768
you get tired.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.603
That something you
could’ve thought about

01:08:44.104 --> 01:08:44.939
in the first place.

01:08:46.148 --> 01:08:47.066
You know the story?

01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:50.611
Nah, we don’t give a shit
about the story.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.112
We hear lots of stories.

01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:54.782
See, he’s not gonna appreciate
it, but you might.

01:08:56.158 --> 01:08:58.868
A short one?
Yeah, sure.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.538
I’ll buy you a beer.

01:09:01.622 --> 01:09:03.541
You can cut me off if
you get bored.

01:09:05.835 --> 01:09:07.377
Me and Franco...

01:09:07.461 --> 01:09:09.255
-Franco like this place?
-Yeah.

01:09:09.337 --> 01:09:11.131
This is him.

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:12.550
He had a different
name before.

01:09:12.633 --> 01:09:14.426
He changed it after
he bought this place.

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:15.719
Cheaper than buying a new sign.

01:09:15.803 --> 01:09:19.430
Actually, a lot
more expensive.

01:09:19.515 --> 01:09:21.725
See, me and Franco
used to be you and you.

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:24.603
I guess I was you because
Franco wasn’t an asshole.

01:09:24.687 --> 01:09:26.897
The organization
found us doing PMC work.

01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:27.982
PMC?

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:30.067
Private Military Contractors,

01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:32.569
mercenaries,
ex-Rangers, ex-Seals.

01:09:32.653 --> 01:09:34.071
Which were you?

01:09:34.154 --> 01:09:35.698
Franco was a Ranger.

01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:39.660
I was a... truck driver.

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.620
Saved his life,
more by accident

01:09:41.703 --> 01:09:42.955
than anything else,
if I’m being honest.

01:09:43.037 --> 01:09:45.040
He took me under his wing.

01:09:45.124 --> 01:09:46.959
You know, you’re not helping me
keep this story short.

01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:51.462
Our people hired
you and Franco?

01:09:51.546 --> 01:09:52.881
Is it okay if I
fix myself a drink?

01:09:52.965 --> 01:09:54.383
Please do.

01:09:54.466 --> 01:09:56.886
Turned out we were working for
them and didn’t even know it.

01:09:57.678 --> 01:09:58.846
Cameroon.

01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:06.186
I learned why they called
them "blood diamonds".

01:10:09.148 --> 01:10:11.150
Franco was a genius
at that shit.

01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:12.610
How to track people down,

01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:13.986
when to kill them,
when to let...

01:10:15.112 --> 01:10:16.989
What did the
organization tell you?

01:10:17.072 --> 01:10:18.407
That you stole money.

01:10:20.409 --> 01:10:23.412
That would be part of
the cautionary tale.

01:10:26.457 --> 01:10:28.959
So after Cameroon,
Franco and I are sent

01:10:29.043 --> 01:10:30.711
all over the world
taking care of shit.

01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:32.171
Ah! That’s me and him.

01:10:32.254 --> 01:10:34.548
Right.

01:10:34.632 --> 01:10:39.136
Seven years ago, Mexican Border
Patrol seizes the shipment.

01:10:39.219 --> 01:10:42.097
Me and Franco were sent
south with a bag of money.

01:10:42.181 --> 01:10:43.474
Cops tried to haggle for more.

01:10:43.557 --> 01:10:46.143
So the organization says,
"Teach ’em a lesson!

01:10:46.226 --> 01:10:48.187
Burn the shipment!
Bring back the money!"

01:10:49.855 --> 01:10:51.690
Which was good and well.
Nothing new.

01:10:55.945 --> 01:10:58.822
Except it was
a shipment of girls,

01:10:58.906 --> 01:11:00.824
Eleven, ten.

01:11:03.118 --> 01:11:04.370
Nine years old.

01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:10.334
Yeah, so...

01:11:12.503 --> 01:11:13.671
Aw, this is bullshit.

01:11:15.297 --> 01:11:18.425
Now why the fuck would
I make up a story like this?

01:11:18.509 --> 01:11:19.510
So I wouldn’t kill you.

01:11:19.593 --> 01:11:22.888
Jesus Christ!
You are fucking dim.

01:11:22.972 --> 01:11:24.431
I was you, remember?

01:11:24.515 --> 01:11:28.352
I heard plenty of stories,
worse stories!

01:11:28.435 --> 01:11:30.938
It’s all secondhand.
It’s abstract to you.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:34.191
It’s not staring at a cage
full of little girls

01:11:34.274 --> 01:11:35.526
and know...

01:11:38.445 --> 01:11:41.907
light them on fire,
or never go home.

01:11:47.538 --> 01:11:48.956
So you kept the money
and bolted?

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.958
And cut the girls loose.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.252
Any one of the three things
was enough to get us killed.

01:11:53.335 --> 01:11:55.379
But my feeling is
setting the girls loose

01:11:55.462 --> 01:11:56.714
was what really
pissed them off

01:11:56.797 --> 01:11:58.716
because then they had
to send someone else

01:11:58.799 --> 01:12:01.719
to hunt them down
and round them up.

01:12:01.802 --> 01:12:03.429
And do what we didn’t.

01:12:05.556 --> 01:12:08.475
Someone with a tolerance for
that kind of heinous shit.

01:12:10.436 --> 01:12:12.312
Maybe even an appetite for it.

01:12:17.317 --> 01:12:18.736
So they died anyway?

01:12:20.362 --> 01:12:21.655
All of that was for nothin’.

01:12:21.739 --> 01:12:24.950
Didn’t seem like it at the time,
not for Franco, especially.

01:12:27.119 --> 01:12:28.454
He took one of the girls.

01:12:31.623 --> 01:12:34.585
No, you assholes,
not like that!

01:12:34.668 --> 01:12:37.046
A switch flipped,
rolled him back past

01:12:37.129 --> 01:12:39.506
working for the organization,
back past the merc shit

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:42.259
in Cameroon, back to the guy
he imagined he’d be

01:12:42.342 --> 01:12:44.595
when he signed up to
fight for his country!

01:12:46.263 --> 01:12:48.599
He wanted to be a good guy,
a decent guy.

01:12:48.682 --> 01:12:50.642
Bought this place,
bought a new identity.

01:12:54.646 --> 01:12:56.482
He raised that girl
like a daughter.

01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:11.288
This guy’s fuckin’ dead.

01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:13.582
Yeah, I poisoned him.
We’re almost to that part.

01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:16.043
Relax.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.795
If I’d been able to pull
that trick twice

01:13:17.878 --> 01:13:19.254
we wouldn’t
still be talking.

01:13:20.297 --> 01:13:21.882
Let’s just do this, man.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.717
/You want to hear
the end, don’t you?

01:13:23.801 --> 01:13:25.469
I mean the thought of
walking out of here

01:13:25.552 --> 01:13:27.179
and never having
got to the point?

01:13:37.106 --> 01:13:39.316
Franco and the girl?

01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:43.612
His daughter for all
intents and purposes!

01:13:43.695 --> 01:13:44.947
And just like
any other daughter,

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.991
she turned 17 and decides
that she hates him.

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:51.703
Gets involved with some asshole,
convinces her to mule E.

01:13:51.787 --> 01:13:54.289
Doesn’t even make it out of town
before she’s picked up

01:13:54.373 --> 01:13:57.501
by this tag team local
policia and federal agent,

01:13:57.584 --> 01:14:00.003
Miguel Garcia
and Lance Ericson.

01:14:04.758 --> 01:14:06.552
What happens next
is anybody’s guess.

01:14:10.055 --> 01:14:13.809
Suffice it to say
the pills disappear.

01:14:15.894 --> 01:14:18.480
Then the girl’s body
turns up in a field...

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:25.320
naked, tortured...

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.993
cut into pieces!

01:14:50.888 --> 01:14:53.307
So what do you think Franco,
hardcore soldier,

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.601
mercenary, professional killer
like your own bad selves,

01:14:55.684 --> 01:14:57.603
what do you think
he does next?

01:14:57.686 --> 01:14:59.229
He goes after the motherfuckers.

01:14:59.313 --> 01:15:01.023
Goes after the motherfuckers!

01:15:01.106 --> 01:15:03.567
So insane with grief,
he forgets every lesson

01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:06.486
he ever taught me about
patience, about stealth.

01:15:12.034 --> 01:15:13.619
And I didn’t stop him.

01:15:16.371 --> 01:15:17.831
I didn’t stop Franco.

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:20.959
Just like I didn’t stop...

01:15:43.732 --> 01:15:45.150
He’s an unguided missile.

01:15:51.573 --> 01:15:54.159
And these cops don’t
exist in a vacuum.

01:15:54.243 --> 01:15:56.286
They’re on the payroll
of a very bad woman...

01:16:00.874 --> 01:16:02.459
A woman who doesn’t
give a shit about

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:05.671
anybody’s adopted daughter,
his boss,

01:16:05.754 --> 01:16:07.005
who also happens to be dead

01:16:07.089 --> 01:16:09.383
rolled up in
a bedspread upstairs!

01:16:19.434 --> 01:16:21.019
So that’s why you
been here a year?

01:16:21.103 --> 01:16:22.312
Yeah.

01:16:22.396 --> 01:16:23.981
Getting even for your
dumb ass friend fucking up

01:16:24.064 --> 01:16:26.108
getting even for his
dumb ass not-even-daughter?

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:28.986
I take it back, man.

01:16:29.069 --> 01:16:31.321
That is the saddest fuckin’
story I’ve ever heard.

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:35.951
I’m not surprised
you see it that way.

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:41.873
You cut it close,
settling accounts

01:16:41.957 --> 01:16:43.292
right before we found you.

01:16:44.751 --> 01:16:46.211
I let you find me.

01:16:50.382 --> 01:16:51.633
You wanna die?

01:16:55.804 --> 01:17:01.977
Well, let’s just say
I’ve had a good meal,

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.770
and I’m
not hungry anymore.

01:17:05.314 --> 01:17:08.567
And because the money won’t
do me any good anymore,

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.902
there’s a safe in my office.

01:17:10.986 --> 01:17:12.612
Cash, jewelry,

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.408
plus about $250,000
in diamonds.

01:17:20.912 --> 01:17:22.414
This is the combination.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:26.793
You should have listened
to your own story.

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.339
That’s not enough
to buy us off.

01:17:30.422 --> 01:17:32.716
-It’s not even close.
-I know.

01:17:32.799 --> 01:17:35.344
It’s motivation for the person
I’ve really been talking to.

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.451
You had to hear
the fucking story, huh?

01:17:59.534 --> 01:18:00.410
Let’s go!

01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:54.464
Ah!

01:19:42.888 --> 01:19:43.847
Woo!

01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:37.317
Come on.

01:22:15.206 --> 01:22:17.292
Almost worth seeing what you
think you can do with that.

01:22:19.336 --> 01:22:20.670
But I been trying to
get the fuck outta here

01:22:20.754 --> 01:22:22.130
for the last half hour.

01:22:42.067 --> 01:22:44.569
In my day, a professional
wouldn’t use a strange gun

01:22:44.653 --> 01:22:45.904
without checking it first.

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:51.660
Let’s go get your stuff.

01:23:03.588 --> 01:23:04.714
You’re Arana.

01:23:05.965 --> 01:23:08.218
I used a cutout to deal
with your girlfriend,

01:23:08.301 --> 01:23:10.178
but, yeah, pretty much.

01:23:10.261 --> 01:23:13.598
Bad news is, I don’t have
a new identity for you.

01:23:13.682 --> 01:23:16.976
Good news is, with her dead,
you don’t need one.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.228
You couldn’t have known.

01:23:18.311 --> 01:23:20.230
Not everything.

01:23:20.313 --> 01:23:24.442
You leading her to me
was definitely Plan B.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:30.240
Plan A was her and
Lance killed each other.

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:32.575
And maybe me.

01:23:34.119 --> 01:23:36.162
I would have felt
badly about that.

01:23:36.246 --> 01:23:37.580
Not badly enough.

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:38.665
No.

01:23:46.381 --> 01:23:48.091
Took them out of Cameroon.

01:23:48.174 --> 01:23:50.677
Never felt right
about spending them.

01:23:52.721 --> 01:23:54.222
And those two out there?

01:23:54.305 --> 01:23:55.890
Bought me some time
before their people

01:23:55.974 --> 01:23:57.434
send the next pair
looking for me.

01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.228
I hate to cut this short,

01:24:00.311 --> 01:24:02.480
but I have a few last things
to do before I go.

01:24:03.982 --> 01:24:04.983
Go where?

01:24:54.032 --> 01:24:56.075
What if I’d killed Sanchez?

01:24:59.412 --> 01:25:00.830
There was a Plan C.

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:04.584
I didn’t kill those girls.

01:25:06.294 --> 01:25:07.295
I couldn’t.

01:25:09.464 --> 01:25:11.674
You didn’t stop it.

01:25:11.758 --> 01:25:12.759
No.

01:25:16.596 --> 01:25:17.806
I didn’t.

01:25:35.698 --> 01:25:36.950
I haven’t been right since.

01:25:37.033 --> 01:25:38.868
I haven’t been able
to look at my daughter.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.789
You want me to say I’m sorry?

01:25:42.872 --> 01:25:44.874
You want me to say anything
other than fuck you?

01:25:44.958 --> 01:25:46.709
Oh, well, you don’t
have the right.

01:25:46.793 --> 01:25:48.503
No, I don’t.

01:25:50.672 --> 01:25:51.840
The guy you hired me through,

01:25:51.923 --> 01:25:53.716
when he finds out
that Sanchez is dead,

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.385
he’s gonna go
after my daughter.

01:26:07.438 --> 01:26:08.523
Her number’s in there.

01:26:09.607 --> 01:26:11.651
It’s the only number in there.

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:12.944
That’s not my problem.

01:26:13.945 --> 01:26:16.155
You set this in motion!

01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:17.866
What do you expect me to do?

01:26:22.245 --> 01:26:23.621
What you seem to do best.

01:26:25.582 --> 01:26:26.666
Just think of something.

01:27:05.496 --> 01:27:07.040
Oh, for Christ’s sake.
