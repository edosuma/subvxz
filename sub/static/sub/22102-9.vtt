I THINK I SHOULD JUST WAIT
FOR MY HUSBAND, OKAY?

37:24.372 --> 37:25.721
I REALLY THINK
I SHOULD JUST WAIT.

37:31.205 --> 37:34.513
[GRUNTING]

37:44.349 --> 37:45.524
PSST.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.352
[GROANS]

38:09.722 --> 38:11.550
COME ON,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.942
COME ON. UP WE GO.

38:13.073 --> 38:14.683
LET'S GO.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.381
-COME ON, PRETTY LADY.
-NO, THIS IS A SETUP, MAN.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.469
YOU KNOW,
THE POLICE AND THE COAST GUARD

38:17.599 --> 38:19.209
KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.342
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THEY KNOW?
HUH? HEY, EASY! EASY!

38:23.823 --> 38:25.215
-GET OVER HERE!
-STOP!

38:27.043 --> 38:29.524
THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO CONVICT YOU FOREVER--

38:29.655 --> 38:31.265
STOP! STOP! STOP IT!

38:31.396 --> 38:33.659
STOP IT! I DON'T WANNA HURT YOU.

38:37.576 --> 38:40.448
HOLD STILL! THAT'S IT
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!

38:41.667 --> 38:43.886
THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THIS.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.888
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

38:46.019 --> 38:47.977
THAT'S IT. COME ON.

38:48.108 --> 38:49.327
[GRUNTS]

38:53.026 --> 38:55.637
-BE QUIET.
-MITCH!

39:02.775 --> 39:04.342
YOU'RE GOING OVER.
YOU'RE GOING OVER.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.128
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. LET HER GO.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.782
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO,

39:09.912 --> 39:10.957
IF YOU DON'T DROP THAT GUN.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.306
NOW!

39:12.437 --> 39:15.483
[WHIMPERING]

39:17.137 --> 39:18.530
YOU DROP HER...

39:19.922 --> 39:21.359
I'LL DROP HIM.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.186
[WHIMPERING]

39:27.190 --> 39:29.192
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL ME.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.197
[GRUNTS]

39:42.815 --> 39:45.383
GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW IF
I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU OR NOT.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.698
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, LILLY?

39:58.396 --> 40:00.006
YEAH, I'M FINE, TREVOR.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.094
CAN I GET YOU OUT OF THOSE?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.053
NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M...

40:04.184 --> 40:06.404
KIND OF ATTACHED TO 'EM.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.202
HOW'S GARNER?

40:22.332 --> 40:24.857
OH, HE'S A LITTLE GREEN
AROUND THE EDGES.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.815
BUT I THINK THE FACT
THAT THE COAST GUARD

40:26.946 --> 40:28.687
RECOVERED THE YACHT

40:28.817 --> 40:30.950
AND THE REST OF THE PIRATES,
IT'S EASING THE PAIN A BIT.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.433
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN YOU
INVOLVED IN THIS.

40:37.522 --> 40:38.697
I'M SORRY.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.656
I DON'T KNOW.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.397
I THOUGHT THE INVOLVEMENT GOT
PRETTY INTERESTING THERE

40:43.528 --> 40:44.442
FOR A WHILE.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.237
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT TREVOR.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.718
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HIM
MORE THAN ME.

40:59.848 --> 41:02.590
WHEN I WAS AFRAID I MIGHT DIE,
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU, NOT HIM.

41:02.721 --> 41:04.070
WELL, WHEN I WAS SWIMMING,

41:04.200 --> 41:05.550
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
AND NOT LILLY.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.727
WHY DO YOU THINK
WE HAD TO BE THEM

41:08.857 --> 41:10.598
IN ORDER TO GET SO CLOSE?

41:10.729 --> 41:12.426
THEY DON'T HAVE OUR HISTORY.

41:13.253 --> 41:14.472
I WONDER WHAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED

41:14.602 --> 41:16.212
BETWEEN TREVOR AND LILLY

41:16.343 --> 41:17.736
IF THERE HADN'T BEEN
SUCH AN UNTIMELY INTERRUPTION.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.392
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.570
I GUESS NOT.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.577
I THINK MAYBE I'LL DYE MY HAIR.

41:34.535 --> 41:37.495
YEAH,
MAYBE I'LL GROW A MUSTACHE.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.499
IT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

41:41.629 --> 41:43.588
-THINK SO?
-YEAH.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.287
MAYBE I'LL GROW ONE.

41:50.029 --> 41:53.206
I JUST LOVE TO KISS
A MAN WITH A MUSTACHE.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.862
WHAT?

41:56.992 --> 41:58.820
HMM?

41:58.951 --> 42:00.822
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

42:00.953 --> 42:02.650
OH, NOTHING.
