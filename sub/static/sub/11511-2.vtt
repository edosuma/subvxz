00:26.151 --> 00:27.491
We need your help with something.

00:27.544 --> 00:28.544
It's with Boots.

00:28.545 --> 00:29.724
(grunting)

00:29.725 --> 00:31.624
The guy Boots attacked was Darryl.

00:31.625 --> 00:32.683
Darryl from Quitman?

00:32.685 --> 00:34.033
- (grunting, shouting)
- BOOTS: He had it coming.

00:34.087 --> 00:35.085
They all do.

00:35.086 --> 00:36.195
I just think it's strange that

00:36.196 --> 00:38.215
Jackson is just back in our lives.

00:38.216 --> 00:40.095
Is something going on?

00:44.736 --> 00:47.595
Damn it, Terry, this is
the last thing I need right now.

00:49.822 --> 00:51.711
then you might be next.

00:51.854 --> 00:52.883
Have Dooley take care of him.

00:53.184 --> 00:55.253
(grunts)

00:55.332 --> 00:58.231
(flatlining)

01:05.426 --> 01:06.813
You're talking about committing a crime.

01:06.838 --> 01:08.519
No, we're talking about justice!

01:08.769 --> 01:10.668
Darryl Williams died this morning.

01:10.721 --> 01:12.701
Just wondering if you gentlemen
might know anything about that.

01:22.076 --> 01:24.096
(low, indistinct conversations)

01:25.177 --> 01:27.187
(water running)

01:34.420 --> 01:37.400
(speaking indistinctly)

01:37.687 --> 01:39.686
I already told you. I didn't do it.

01:39.687 --> 01:41.419
- Yeah. You sure? 'Cause you wanted to.
- You know what,

01:41.420 --> 01:42.468
I wish I had.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.173
- Darryl deserved it.
- Damn right.

01:44.174 --> 01:45.566
Yeah? And what about you?
Where were you?

01:45.567 --> 01:47.065
- What?
- Last night, where were you?

01:47.066 --> 01:49.013
You serious? I was at home,
just like he was.

01:49.038 --> 01:49.952
Ah, so you two have talked.

01:49.952 --> 01:50.862
For God's sake, Jackie!

01:50.887 --> 01:52.243
You know what, instead of accusing
us, Yeah, we actually talk.

01:52.268 --> 01:53.675
why don't you tell us
where you were last night.

01:53.962 --> 01:55.442
You seriously asking me that question?

01:55.467 --> 01:57.142
Hey, why not? You're the one
who said you had a plan.

01:57.142 --> 01:59.860
Yeah, I did, but it
didn't involve killing anybody.

02:01.042 --> 02:02.961
Yeah, Darryl's dead.

02:02.962 --> 02:04.121
You know what? I don't care.

02:04.122 --> 02:06.221
What I do care about is
who killed my best friend

02:06.222 --> 02:08.571
- and what we're gonna do about it.
- Don't even start, man.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.062
You swore, Jackie. It's payback time.

02:11.062 --> 02:13.991
He's right. Hey, what about
everything you told me about

02:13.992 --> 02:15.111
at the hospital about the warden

02:15.112 --> 02:16.667
and that fake-ass riot and Terry Bausch?

02:16.692 --> 02:19.112
I told you that to warn you.

02:20.152 --> 02:22.081
Look what happened.

02:22.082 --> 02:23.848
A man's been been murdered, and
now the cops think we did it.

02:23.849 --> 02:26.121
Screw the cops. We ain't scared.

02:26.122 --> 02:28.081
And you shouldn't be either.

02:28.082 --> 02:30.917
Listen, it's time for us
to focus on our next move.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.409
There is no next move, Shawn.

02:33.952 --> 02:34.929
The best thing we can do is just

02:34.930 --> 02:36.962
lay low and pray
this whole thing goes away.

02:36.987 --> 02:39.732
Wait, wait,
that's how you really feel? Huh?

02:39.733 --> 02:41.478
After we just watched our brother

02:41.479 --> 02:43.538
get lowered into a grave
not even an hour ago.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.345
- I can't, I can't, I can't.
- Why not?

02:45.346 --> 02:46.628
'Cause I need some time, Shawn.

02:46.653 --> 02:49.267
- How much time?
- Just time, Shawn!

02:52.012 --> 02:54.512
I swear to God, Gil, if you lied
to me about killing Darryl...

02:54.513 --> 02:56.275
How many times you gonna ask me that?!

02:57.154 --> 03:00.342
SHAWN: If he said he didn't
do it, he didn't do it.

03:00.343 --> 03:02.342
(indistinct police transmission)

03:02.343 --> 03:05.172
So, we got no signs of forced
entry, no signs of a struggle.

03:05.173 --> 03:07.232
Victim was shot three times
at close range.

03:07.233 --> 03:09.192
I'm guessing he knew
the person that shot him.

03:09.193 --> 03:11.282
Oscar, I know. I was here this morning.

03:11.283 --> 03:12.147
What you got there?

03:12.172 --> 03:15.377
This. I found it hidden
in the back about an hour ago.

03:18.273 --> 03:19.206
It's about 100 grand.

03:19.207 --> 03:21.772
- Give or take.
- Did you go through Darryl's phone?

03:21.773 --> 03:22.826
Mm-hmm.

03:22.851 --> 03:25.323
The guy who attacked him,
Gary Nolan, was he on it?

03:25.323 --> 03:26.586
What about a Jackson Brooks,

03:26.587 --> 03:28.640
- Gil Harris, Shawn Cook?
- No.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.808
- (baby crying)
- But I'll run the numbers

03:29.833 --> 03:30.862
that don't have names.

03:30.887 --> 03:33.289
Last person that Darryl spoke
with was, uh, his girlfriend,

03:34.193 --> 03:35.536
Mariah Parks.

03:35.536 --> 03:38.322
Track her down. Keep checking
with the neighbors.

03:38.323 --> 03:39.867
Darryl was shot in the middle
of the night...

03:39.892 --> 03:41.066
somebody heard somethin'.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.809
For sure, somebody's gonna be
missing that money.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.960
The drop is tomorrow, right?

03:47.646 --> 03:48.940
Yeah, at the airport.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.789
That's why Darryl checked
himself out of the hospital.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.160
Either of you guys see him
after he got out?

03:53.185 --> 03:54.324
No.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.966
I should've gone to his crib,

03:57.132 --> 03:58.795
left him a pie or something.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.564
I feel real bad.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.232
You saw him, right?

04:04.232 --> 04:06.131
Yeah, when he came
to pick up the payment,

04:06.132 --> 04:08.152
which now belongs to the Houston PD.

04:09.173 --> 04:10.182
I got to...

04:10.182 --> 04:12.182
cover that now.

04:14.132 --> 04:16.613
We can't miss that drop tomorrow.

04:17.182 --> 04:18.261
You guys know the runner?

04:18.262 --> 04:20.190
The air marshal? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:20.192 --> 04:21.466
I tagged along with Darryl a few times.

04:21.981 --> 04:23.572
You go in his place,

04:23.921 --> 04:26.090
- take Eddie with you.
- T...

04:26.091 --> 04:28.139
what about who killed Darryl?

04:28.545 --> 04:30.524
I thought we took care
of that with the, uh,

04:30.525 --> 04:31.684
Dooley hit in the jailhouse.

04:31.685 --> 04:34.698
Yeah, so did I, Eddie.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.388
Okay.

04:41.595 --> 04:42.836
Let's do this, Eddie.

04:46.555 --> 04:48.565
(door opens, closes)

04:53.735 --> 04:55.595
JACKSON: How you holding up?

04:58.575 --> 05:00.102
What was all that out there?

05:01.301 --> 05:04.830
We're just having a-a hard time
with Boots' death, that's all.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.522
You haven't talked to him
in 20 years, Jackson.

05:11.525 --> 05:14.618
So how long are you planning
on sticking around this time?

05:17.075 --> 05:18.536
I'm not going anywhere, Jessie.

05:20.585 --> 05:23.271
Oh, you've said that to me before.

05:28.735 --> 05:31.574
I got it, I got it, I got it.

05:31.575 --> 05:33.605
I got it. (grunts)

05:38.695 --> 05:40.518
SHAWN: 'Bout time, sis. Come on.

05:40.519 --> 05:41.752
- Let's roll.
- JESSIE: Hey.

05:42.113 --> 05:43.992
- I think I'm gonna stay.
- What?

05:43.993 --> 05:45.042
Yeah, Annie's parents

05:45.043 --> 05:47.002
are going back to Florida
tonight, and her sister

05:47.003 --> 05:49.549
can't come till tomorrow, so...
I'm not gonna just leave her.

05:49.574 --> 05:50.814
Well, how we gonna get home?

05:51.881 --> 05:53.083
Ride with him.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.770
- (car alarm chirps)
- Maybe you guys can talk some more

05:54.795 --> 05:57.033
and then not tell me what's going on.

05:57.329 --> 05:58.603
'Cause that's always fun.

06:13.359 --> 06:15.409
There's something I got to tell you.

06:19.881 --> 06:21.778
Me and Jessie are together.

06:24.269 --> 06:25.946
(siren wailing in distance)

06:25.971 --> 06:27.525
Okay.

06:30.068 --> 06:31.596
Like-like together-together.

06:31.621 --> 06:34.289
Toge... I know
what "together" means, Gil.

06:34.289 --> 06:35.164
Wh... That's it? That's...

06:35.189 --> 06:37.082
(chuckles) That's what you wanted to tell?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.338
That's it, yeah. Yeah, what?

06:38.339 --> 06:39.504
What did I tell you, G?

06:39.529 --> 06:41.604
You know, you were all
worried about telling him.

06:41.629 --> 06:42.722
What for? (stammers)

06:42.723 --> 06:45.063
I mean, I don't know. We g...

06:45.383 --> 06:47.383
She was... your first thing.

06:47.383 --> 06:48.452
Oh, man.

06:48.453 --> 06:50.512
And if-if I had a problem with it...

06:50.513 --> 06:52.472
I don't... but it's a little late.

06:52.473 --> 06:54.870
I'm-I'm engaged. I told you I'm engaged.

06:54.871 --> 06:56.863
- To a person?
- Yeah, to a person.

06:56.864 --> 06:58.512
Oh, right. Yeah. Right.

06:58.513 --> 07:00.512
Her name's Marina.

07:00.513 --> 07:02.463
- She, uh... she works in my firm.
- Wow.

07:03.573 --> 07:04.592
That's amazing, man.

07:04.593 --> 07:06.532
- Thanks, man.
- That's good.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.582
Good for you, Jackie.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.532
(chuckles) He doesn't mean that.

07:10.533 --> 07:11.956
What are you tal... I-I mean it.

07:11.956 --> 07:14.432
- No.
- If a man wants to go down that road,

07:14.433 --> 07:15.452
then let him go down that road.

07:15.453 --> 07:16.482
He thinks you're crazy.

07:16.483 --> 07:17.483
- He's got a philosophy.
- Listen...

07:17.484 --> 07:18.522
You can tell him.

07:18.523 --> 07:20.482
Come on, Shawnie. What do you got?

07:20.483 --> 07:22.030
All right, first of all,

07:22.031 --> 07:23.592
I think all that's common folk stuff.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.482
- (laughter)
- I'm cool with it.

07:25.483 --> 07:26.582
Right, right. The reality is

07:26.583 --> 07:29.422
the only real reason a man gets married

07:29.423 --> 07:31.482
is, one, he gets a chick pregnant.

07:31.483 --> 07:32.592
(chuckling)

07:32.593 --> 07:34.392
Two is,

07:34.393 --> 07:36.432
uh, you know, you fall in love.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.047
And neither one of those things
I prescribe to.

07:38.047 --> 07:39.481
- (laughs)
- That's just not my get down.

07:39.482 --> 07:40.482
I don't mess with that.

07:40.483 --> 07:41.602
- He doesn't get down with love.
- No.

07:41.603 --> 07:42.543
That's just not me.

07:42.544 --> 07:43.552
So what's-what's

07:43.553 --> 07:44.592
your status then? I'm out here

07:44.593 --> 07:46.442
living the good life,
you know what I mean?

07:46.443 --> 07:47.602
I'm-I'm doing my thing

07:47.603 --> 07:49.592
rock star-style, slanging and banging.

07:49.593 --> 07:50.673
What about you, Gil?

07:50.674 --> 07:52.509
You think you and, uh...
you and Jessie might...

07:52.534 --> 07:55.402
- What, get married? No. No.
- Yeah. No?

07:55.403 --> 07:57.543
I don't know.
Jessie's been divorced twice.

08:00.173 --> 08:01.991
- Jessie has?
- Yeah.

08:03.493 --> 08:05.460
Things haven't always been easy for her.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.531
It's not gonna be any easier
with you either.

08:07.585 --> 08:08.734
What? Wh...

08:08.735 --> 08:10.057
Just sayin'.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.764
Hey, you can... you can slow down.

08:11.765 --> 08:13.775
It's just right up here on the left.

08:23.775 --> 08:25.775
(turns off engine)

08:28.745 --> 08:30.299
So now what?

08:32.628 --> 08:34.188
I'm going home.

08:38.398 --> 08:40.438
You know what I mean, Jackie.

08:42.544 --> 08:43.625
Boots is dead.

08:46.761 --> 08:48.723
Are you with us or not?

09:05.732 --> 09:07.752
Hey, baby. Good morning.

09:08.432 --> 09:09.658
You had a late night.

09:10.185 --> 09:12.145
Yeah, well, it was that, uh,

09:12.146 --> 09:14.145
FCC case. I was out in New Braunfels

09:14.146 --> 09:16.145
going through contracts
with my client all day.

09:16.146 --> 09:18.055
New Braunfels? I'm surprised you didn't

09:18.056 --> 09:20.055
- spend the night.
- Yeah, well, I thought about it.

09:20.056 --> 09:22.135
Then I realized I've got
this really hot fiancée

09:22.136 --> 09:23.195
sitting at home waiting for me,

09:23.196 --> 09:25.704
- so I drove.
- (chuckles)

09:25.704 --> 09:28.156
Well, I am late to pick up
your mother-in-law.

09:28.157 --> 09:29.916
Oh, yeah. Posie waits for no man.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.115
We're gonna look at wedding dresses.

09:32.116 --> 09:33.215
Would you please come with us?

09:33.216 --> 09:35.045
'Cause I don't care about tradition,

09:35.046 --> 09:36.171
and it's gonna go forever.

09:36.196 --> 09:38.996
I love wedding dresses.
You know that, right?

09:38.996 --> 09:41.345
I got to take, um, Joe Hart
to play golf.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.312
But I can... I can bill those
hours, all right?

09:43.337 --> 09:44.418
Mm-mm. No.

09:44.443 --> 09:47.176
But you can thump the hell
out of the firm credit card,

09:47.176 --> 09:48.302
'cause Aaron always does.

09:48.327 --> 09:50.527
- So where are we meeting today?
- The Four Seasons.

09:50.527 --> 09:52.153
Dad reserved us a table on the terrace.

09:52.269 --> 09:54.228
Wow. He doesn't mess around.

09:54.229 --> 09:56.388
Yeah, they're all over me
about this engagement party,

09:56.389 --> 10:00.189
and they're expecting names of
people that you want to invite.

10:01.389 --> 10:02.605
You.

10:03.199 --> 10:04.338
Aaron.

10:04.339 --> 10:06.318
Julio, from the food truck.

10:06.319 --> 10:08.278
Don't. Come on, baby.

10:08.279 --> 10:09.582
Baby, he makes a mean burrito. Come on.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.302
Just... come up with something, okay?
'Cause...

10:11.303 --> 10:13.278
- Okay, okay.
- they're making this a huge deal.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.318
And I love it.

10:14.319 --> 10:16.228
- I love it.
- Maybe I can take

10:16.229 --> 10:17.839
- your name when we get married.
- (chuckles)

10:17.864 --> 10:19.417
Posie would have a heart attack.

10:19.522 --> 10:20.622
- Then let's definitely do it.
- Oh. (chuckles)

10:28.389 --> 10:30.667
I can't wait to be married to you.

10:31.888 --> 10:33.329
Me, too.

10:41.169 --> 10:43.368
Liz, what are you doing here?

10:43.369 --> 10:45.348
Why didn't you tell me
you were in juvie?

10:45.349 --> 10:47.423
- Excuse me?
- Gil Harris, Shawn Cook,

10:47.424 --> 10:50.288
Gary Nolan were all at Quitman in 1988,

10:50.289 --> 10:51.740
along with Darryl Williams.

10:52.289 --> 10:53.045
Were you there, too?

10:53.070 --> 10:55.248
- That's none of your business.
- Actually, it is,

10:55.249 --> 10:58.328
seeing as how I'm conducting
a murder investigation.

10:58.329 --> 10:59.988
Look, I know your record is sealed.

11:00.013 --> 11:02.572
You needed a bar card, I get
that, but you were there, right?

11:02.573 --> 11:03.546
And you knew Darryl.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.967
Am I a suspect in this case, Liz?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.080
I don't know yet.

11:08.780 --> 11:10.893
- That's why I want to talk.
- All right.

11:10.894 --> 11:12.889
Well, I'm just gonna
tell you this one last time.

11:12.890 --> 11:14.418
I was home the night of the murder.

11:14.419 --> 11:16.749
So was Gil, so was Shawn,
so unless you're here

11:16.750 --> 11:18.338
to arrest me, the conversation's over.

11:18.339 --> 11:19.591
Counselor.

11:21.078 --> 11:22.899
You got a nice house,

11:22.900 --> 11:25.106
nice career, a beautiful fiancée.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.092
It would be a shame to lose it all.

11:28.526 --> 11:29.431
I'm just trying to help.

11:29.432 --> 11:30.626
Okay, Liz, you want to help?

11:30.979 --> 11:32.957
Then you find out
who killed my client in jail

11:33.319 --> 11:37.259
and get your damn car
out of my driveway, please.

11:47.961 --> 11:50.710
So, how you holding up?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.537
Must have been pretty tough yesterday.

11:53.283 --> 11:54.692
Can I ask you something?

11:55.081 --> 11:56.620
This Jackson guy.

11:57.493 --> 11:59.130
He wasn't at our wedding,

11:59.493 --> 12:01.773
never even heard his name
before last week,

12:02.251 --> 12:04.298
and then, all of a sudden,
he's Boots' lawyer?

12:05.011 --> 12:06.901
How do you guys all know him so well?

12:07.523 --> 12:09.059
We don't really.

12:10.578 --> 12:11.960
I guess it's just one of those things

12:11.961 --> 12:13.140
when you grow up together.

12:13.844 --> 12:14.578
I, uh,

12:14.579 --> 12:18.180
met him and the boys after my
mom and I moved here to Brennan.

12:18.181 --> 12:20.040
(boys laughing nearby)

12:20.041 --> 12:22.000
JACKSON: Gil, you need to stop.

12:22.001 --> 12:23.060
GIL: I think I got its tail.

12:23.061 --> 12:24.130
JACKSON: We need to flush it out.

12:24.131 --> 12:24.694
Grab that hose and bring it over.

12:24.695 --> 12:27.180
Shawn, when I say so,
turn it on full blast.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.533
You got to let go, dude.

12:28.534 --> 12:29.406
You're gonna get wet. (scoffs)

12:29.407 --> 12:30.866
Are you kidding? I finally got him.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.376
There's no way I'm letting go.

12:32.401 --> 12:34.458
- Shawn, now!
- Okay.

12:35.101 --> 12:37.100
- All right, it's on.
- Whoa!

12:37.101 --> 12:40.140
(animal chittering)

12:40.141 --> 12:42.041
Got him.

12:43.101 --> 12:45.010
(laughs)

12:45.011 --> 12:46.099
Who are you?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.300
Jessie.

12:47.301 --> 12:49.407
Jackson. Nice to meet you.

12:50.111 --> 12:51.020
You, too.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.010
What's the matter, you guys scared?

12:54.827 --> 12:56.467
- (growling)
- JESSIE: And from there,

12:56.490 --> 12:58.409
it was just a pretty great summer.

I say we take 'em all down...
the warden, Terry,

13:39.445 --> 13:42.284
his whole crew... and we do it in
the way that no one can deny.

13:42.285 --> 13:45.304
We build a case, brick by brick,
solid as a rock,

13:45.305 --> 13:47.344
and then we put 'em away in prison.

13:47.345 --> 13:50.224
- It's gonna take forever.
- Well, that's-that's the only way, Gil.

13:50.225 --> 13:51.344
No, it isn't. That's your way.

13:51.345 --> 13:52.812
What would you do?

13:52.813 --> 13:54.364
I'd set 'em on fire,
shoot 'em in the face

13:54.365 --> 13:55.414
and go get a bag of tacos.

13:56.299 --> 13:57.798
Do you want my help or not?

13:57.799 --> 13:59.294
SHAWN: All right, Jackie,

13:59.295 --> 14:01.029
how do you think we build this case?

14:01.030 --> 14:02.364
That's the million dollar
question, Shawnie,

14:02.365 --> 14:04.234
'cause everything they did to us,

14:04.235 --> 14:05.394
everything is beyond the statue
of limitations,

14:05.395 --> 14:08.254
so we got to link him to a crime that...

14:08.255 --> 14:09.414
that doesn't have a clock on it.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.415
Like what?

14:11.171 --> 14:12.445
Like murder.

14:14.782 --> 14:16.424
That's the only one.

14:21.348 --> 14:23.043
What about Petey?

14:28.255 --> 14:30.314
(grunts)

14:30.315 --> 14:32.264
Okay, go ahead,

14:32.265 --> 14:33.795
but be careful.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.334
- (hissing)
- Aah! Aah!

14:39.335 --> 14:42.374
- Aah, that stuff burns.
- Wash it off. You'll be okay.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.096
Stop talking and refill that bucket.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.255
(sighs)

14:49.315 --> 14:51.235
(groaning softly)

14:55.445 --> 14:57.354
(Petey screaming) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.444
Whoa, whoa. Petey!

14:58.445 --> 14:59.662
(screaming)

14:59.663 --> 15:01.404
Hey, stay right there!
Petey, Petey, are you okay?

15:01.405 --> 15:02.711
SHAWN: Help him! What are you just
standing there for?!

15:02.712 --> 15:03.671
You got to help him!

15:03.672 --> 15:05.178
Help him!

15:05.179 --> 15:08.244
- Help him! What are you doing?
- (screaming)

15:08.245 --> 15:12.225
- You have to do something!
- (screaming continues)

15:16.405 --> 15:17.838
They took him to the infirmary.

15:17.952 --> 15:19.951
Never saw him again after that.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.131
I remember. They said
that he was transferred, right?

15:22.132 --> 15:25.071
Yeah, we tried to find him
when we got out, but nothing.

15:25.072 --> 15:27.041
Wait, who did? You-you two went
to try and find him?

15:27.042 --> 15:28.667
Yeah, something happened
to that kid, though.

15:28.668 --> 15:29.621
Yeah, seriously.

15:29.622 --> 15:31.061
He vanished.

15:31.062 --> 15:32.091
Why didn't you tell me?

15:32.092 --> 15:34.162
You weren't around.

15:38.259 --> 15:40.248
Okay, this is good, guys.

15:40.249 --> 15:41.548
This is exactly what we need.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.708
What's the name of that...

15:42.709 --> 15:44.803
the nurse who worked
at the infirmary? Reese?

15:44.804 --> 15:45.782
Amy. Amy.

15:45.783 --> 15:46.943
Amy Reese.

15:47.631 --> 15:51.020
Ah, it's been a while,
but she and I kept in contact.

15:51.021 --> 15:53.392
I know where she works
if y'all want to go talk to her.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.985
- Let's go.
- SHAWN: Mm-hmm.

15:59.119 --> 16:00.271
Okay.

16:05.426 --> 16:07.375
I'm sorry to hear about Darryl.

16:07.376 --> 16:10.225
Yeah, I feel your grief.

16:10.226 --> 16:12.265
The man who attacked him was Gary Nolan.

16:12.266 --> 16:14.295
No kidding.

16:14.296 --> 16:16.087
I took care of that at the jailhouse,

16:16.088 --> 16:18.341
and Darryl still somehow ended up dead.

16:19.426 --> 16:21.445
Gary Nolan... that doesn't ring a bell?

16:21.446 --> 16:22.858
No, Warden.

16:23.672 --> 16:24.544
Why should it?

16:25.111 --> 16:27.057
At Quitman, they called him "Boots."

16:28.446 --> 16:30.385
Oh, that little white kid.

16:30.386 --> 16:32.362
Where you think you're going?

16:34.266 --> 16:36.336
Yeah, that little white kid.

16:38.346 --> 16:40.385
You must have been awful to that boy.

16:40.386 --> 16:43.452
I seem to remember you messing
with him the night of the riot.

16:44.478 --> 16:46.158
That was over 20 years ago.

16:46.518 --> 16:48.245
People have long memories, Terry,

16:48.638 --> 16:50.627
especially when they're bad.

16:51.194 --> 16:53.071
Another piece of information...

16:53.598 --> 16:56.637
Mr. Nolan was represented by
a lawyer named Jackson Brooks,

16:56.638 --> 16:58.463
his friend from Quitman.

16:59.171 --> 17:00.370
Jackson.

17:00.371 --> 17:02.370
Leave him alone.

17:02.371 --> 17:04.330
What you gonna do about it? Hmm?

17:09.653 --> 17:10.867
You think he killed Darryl?

17:11.320 --> 17:13.565
I don't know, and more
importantly, I don't care.

17:14.171 --> 17:15.515
You see, this isn't my fight, Terry.

17:15.982 --> 17:18.162
I've done what I agreed
to do, and that's it,

17:18.731 --> 17:20.048
so keep me out of this.

17:22.271 --> 17:24.290
I mean it.

17:26.013 --> 17:29.074
Do not turn this into a problem
for me or my campaign.

17:30.301 --> 17:32.330
Do I make myself clear?

17:32.331 --> 17:34.331
Oh, crystal.

17:38.496 --> 17:41.535
Darryl and I had only been
dating, like, four months.

17:42.248 --> 17:45.615
When I found him,
there was so much blood.

17:45.616 --> 17:47.565
Do you know what time that was?

17:47.566 --> 17:48.645
I left the bar

17:48.646 --> 17:51.605
around 2:30, so maybe it was 3:00?

17:52.551 --> 17:53.495
See anything

17:53.496 --> 17:55.566
unusual when you got home?

17:56.566 --> 17:58.351
Other than my dead boyfriend?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.615
He's just trying to do his job, Mariah.

18:02.155 --> 18:03.614
Now think back.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.495
Does anything come to mind?

18:05.496 --> 18:06.575
You know,

18:07.263 --> 18:09.505
when I left around 11:00,

18:09.506 --> 18:11.625
there was this truck there
I hadn't seen before.

18:11.626 --> 18:15.575
It was gray, not new,
might have even had, like,

18:15.576 --> 18:17.016
writing on the side or something.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.705
And there were two guys in it.

18:18.706 --> 18:21.496
One was white, and one was black.

18:25.506 --> 18:26.625
(knocking on door)

18:26.626 --> 18:28.546
Just a second.

18:30.666 --> 18:32.575
(door opens)

18:32.576 --> 18:35.646
Ah, how you doing, little brother?

18:36.656 --> 18:38.665
I just heard about Darryl.

18:39.617 --> 18:40.634
What happened?

18:40.941 --> 18:42.427
Darryl got himself shot.

18:42.941 --> 18:44.140
Was he working at the time?

18:44.141 --> 18:46.100
You mean for me? Nah.

18:46.101 --> 18:48.291
I didn't have anything to do with that.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.951
Goes back to Quitman.

18:50.951 --> 18:52.110
Quitman?

18:52.111 --> 18:54.940
Yeah. Those kids from the riot.

18:54.941 --> 18:56.980
This little kid Boots,
he sees Darryl in the streets,

18:56.981 --> 18:58.990
he hits him, so I hit back.

18:58.991 --> 19:00.060
Ain't nothing for you to worry about.

19:00.061 --> 19:02.010
Whoa. Whoa.

19:02.011 --> 19:04.060
But if he got to Darryl...

19:04.061 --> 19:06.070
Like I told you, I'm handling it.

19:06.071 --> 19:07.538
And if his friends
come looking for us...

19:07.539 --> 19:09.899
There is no us,
hasn't been for a long time.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.941
You're a changed man now.

19:13.827 --> 19:15.907
I'm sure God is watching out for you.

19:19.054 --> 19:20.030
Amy?

19:20.878 --> 19:24.156
Shawn? I haven't seen you in forever.

19:24.209 --> 19:25.402
Get over here and give me some.

19:25.403 --> 19:26.623
Mmm!

19:26.930 --> 19:27.979
You remember Jackson Brooks

19:27.980 --> 19:29.675
and Gil Harris?

19:29.676 --> 19:31.789
We were all at Quitman together.

19:31.790 --> 19:33.869
We just wanted to speak
to you about a few things

19:33.870 --> 19:35.360
that, uh... that happened at Quitman.

19:35.637 --> 19:36.622
Like what?

19:36.669 --> 19:37.739
Petey.

19:40.584 --> 19:42.653
Peter Curtis was a foster kid.

19:42.654 --> 19:44.663
We got to Quitman around the same time.

19:44.664 --> 19:46.663
The accident happened
about a year later.

19:46.664 --> 19:48.733
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

19:48.734 --> 19:51.623
(whimpering)

19:51.624 --> 19:53.733
We got to get this boy to a hospital!

19:53.734 --> 19:55.783
- Clearing stumps.
- (Petey crying)

19:55.784 --> 19:57.051
Got a chemical burn.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.329
Hurry up! Hurry up!

19:59.354 --> 20:00.867
All right, take him to the sally port.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.861
I'm gonna have Bobby
bring the van around.

20:03.081 --> 20:04.632
It'll be faster than the ambulance.

20:04.633 --> 20:07.080
AMY: We got to get this
boy to a hospital!

20:07.081 --> 20:08.140
- Hurry up!
- (crying)

20:08.141 --> 20:09.270
AMY: It's okay.

20:09.271 --> 20:11.130
You'll be okay.

20:11.131 --> 20:12.240
(Petey crying)

20:12.241 --> 20:13.290
(engine starting)

20:13.291 --> 20:15.290
- It's best you stay here.
- What?

20:15.291 --> 20:18.170
Petey. No, Petey.

20:18.171 --> 20:20.181
(tires squealing)

20:21.291 --> 20:23.291
(engine accelerating, tires squealing)

20:27.081 --> 20:28.230
That's the last time I saw him.

20:28.231 --> 20:30.510
Where did Red go after the van left?

20:30.844 --> 20:32.210
He said he was headed to E block.

20:32.211 --> 20:34.240
And Petey never came back to Quitman?

20:34.241 --> 20:37.290
The warden said he'd been
transferred, didn't say where.

20:37.291 --> 20:40.070
I've Googled him over the years,
but never found him.

20:40.550 --> 20:44.280
So the last person to see
Petey alive was Bobby Marks?

20:44.281 --> 20:46.290
You got any idea where he is now?

20:46.291 --> 20:49.090
Last I heard, he was
living in some houseboat

20:49.091 --> 20:50.210
over on Chalmers Lake.

20:50.211 --> 20:51.630
He's on disability.

20:51.631 --> 20:53.843
That flat head must have
finally caught up to him.

20:53.844 --> 20:55.480
Wha-what about Red?

20:58.020 --> 20:59.020
I'm not talking about him.

20:59.262 --> 21:00.404
Why not?

21:02.131 --> 21:04.595
Because he disappeared in 1998.

21:06.394 --> 21:07.513
And I'm not gonna be next.

21:07.821 --> 21:08.900
Amy, you'll be okay.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.560
Shawn,

21:10.561 --> 21:12.244
y'all better leave me alone.

21:14.067 --> 21:15.288
Amy?

21:21.542 --> 21:23.481
All right, so there's only
two marinas out there.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.411
I say we start
with the one on the Texas side.

21:25.412 --> 21:27.034
Yeah, that sounds good.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.461
SHAWN: You really think
Bobby's gonna talk to us on camera?

21:29.462 --> 21:32.407
I don't know, but I want
to be ready if he will.

21:32.408 --> 21:34.015
Man, who cares
what that loser has to say.

21:34.040 --> 21:34.898
SHAWN: G, look,

21:34.899 --> 21:37.158
you don't want to do this,
me and Jackie can go.

21:37.159 --> 21:38.912
No, I'm gonna be there, trust me.

21:38.913 --> 21:41.062
Gil, you understand what
we're doing here, right?

21:41.302 --> 21:42.283
You know, we can't build a case

21:42.308 --> 21:44.375
on anything we beat out of him.

21:44.509 --> 21:46.301
So at Bobby's place,
you got to control yourself.

21:46.302 --> 21:47.628
REPORTER: And Channel 2
was there last night

21:47.629 --> 21:50.548
as Lieutenant Governor
Ray Carroll made it official,

21:50.549 --> 21:51.668
announcing his run for congress.

21:51.669 --> 21:52.739
Carroll says that...

21:54.669 --> 21:57.628
Oh, the warden likes you.

21:57.629 --> 21:59.618
...lightly,
but he felt the call to serve

21:59.619 --> 22:01.658
the people of Texas and the nation.

22:01.659 --> 22:03.658
RAY: You know, they say
that I'm too tough on crime...

22:03.659 --> 22:05.508
Hey!

22:05.509 --> 22:07.698
...tough on immigration.
Well, let me tell you something.

22:07.699 --> 22:10.558
One thing that Ray Carroll will never do

22:10.559 --> 22:12.669
is apologize for keeping Texas safe.

22:13.719 --> 22:15.709
TV's busted.

22:21.639 --> 22:23.052
Hey, honey, it's me.

22:23.053 --> 22:26.518
I'm assuming that you got tied
up, but I just wanted to check.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.087
Give me a call when you can. Bye.

22:29.088 --> 22:30.709
(phone beeps off)

22:32.719 --> 22:35.853
Hi, uh, excuse me.
Can you do me a favor?

22:36.559 --> 22:38.343
(speaking low, indistinctly)

22:38.344 --> 22:40.249
...nice bottle of champagne,
do the thing with my parents.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.135
Thanks.

22:41.679 --> 22:43.035
There she is.

22:43.282 --> 22:45.411
- I am so sorry.
- Hi, sweetie.

22:45.679 --> 22:47.718
I was just saying Jackson
doesn't have the kind of job

22:47.719 --> 22:49.693
that has... regular hours.

22:49.694 --> 22:51.693
- Oh, no.
- I used to be at the mercy

22:51.694 --> 22:53.954
of other people's schedules until, uh,

22:53.955 --> 22:56.405
we consolidated those
wells in Tyler and then...

22:56.406 --> 22:58.121
Well, you know what I love about him?

22:58.146 --> 22:59.688
Those teeth.

22:59.689 --> 23:01.728
Oh, Posie, please.
They are so nice and straight

23:01.729 --> 23:02.968
and white.

23:02.993 --> 23:05.379
Maybe your children
won't need braces like you did.

23:05.404 --> 23:07.469
Let's hope not, Mom.
MAN: Pardon the interruption,

23:07.470 --> 23:09.670
- but this is from Jackson.
- Oh!

23:09.671 --> 23:10.925
He says he's sorry he couldn't make it

23:10.950 --> 23:11.930
and he hopes you enjoy.

23:11.955 --> 23:14.699
- Bless his heart.
- Oh, that's classy.

23:15.762 --> 23:16.901
(pops)

23:17.322 --> 23:18.326
Love that sound.

23:18.388 --> 23:19.831
Thank you.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.217
Where's Darryl?

23:26.649 --> 23:28.562
Dude, you remember me.

23:28.882 --> 23:30.177
Darryl's moved on.

23:30.462 --> 23:32.472
Well, nobody told me that.

23:38.008 --> 23:39.347
That's Eddie.

23:39.348 --> 23:40.707
Hey. What's up?

23:44.289 --> 23:46.043
So you got the additional 50?

23:48.369 --> 23:49.448
The additional 50?

23:49.988 --> 23:51.741
Darryl should've told you.

23:52.369 --> 23:53.788
Price went up.

23:55.369 --> 23:56.408
No.

23:56.409 --> 23:57.964
We do not have that.

23:58.369 --> 23:59.428
Then get it.

24:00.409 --> 24:02.158
You have a few hours.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.543
My flight doesn't leave till 7:00.

24:16.339 --> 24:19.444
These were the men in
jail with your husband.

24:19.928 --> 24:22.857
Just look closely at each face.

24:22.882 --> 24:24.790
Do any of them look familiar?

24:26.409 --> 24:28.446
I don't know any of these men.

24:30.459 --> 24:33.143
But I can't imagine
my husband did either.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.504
He was a good man.

24:34.505 --> 24:38.026
I just can't understand
why anyone would...

24:40.214 --> 24:42.405
...or why he would attack someone.

24:44.155 --> 24:45.454
We're having a baby.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.453
None of this
is supposed to be happening.

24:48.455 --> 24:50.374
I understand how difficult this is.

24:51.266 --> 24:52.906
I appreciate you trying.

24:53.415 --> 24:56.504
One of these men ended
your husband's life.

24:56.505 --> 24:59.514
It's just a matter of time
till we find out which one.

25:00.234 --> 25:02.121
There has to be something I can do.

25:03.026 --> 25:04.355
There is.

25:05.923 --> 25:07.485
Get that baby here safe.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.264
Call me if you remember anything.

25:16.435 --> 25:18.414
Thanks for your time.

25:18.415 --> 25:19.897
Thanks, Detective.

25:21.475 --> 25:23.200
(door closes)

25:32.465 --> 25:33.716
This has got to be it.

25:51.588 --> 25:53.667
We're just having a conversation, Gil.

25:53.957 --> 25:55.006
I'm fine.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.559
You sure?

25:57.558 --> 26:00.548
(footsteps approaching)

26:04.678 --> 26:06.517
That's him. Hey! Gil!

26:06.518 --> 26:08.507
- That's him.
- Get off me!

26:08.508 --> 26:09.717
You remember me, Bobby?!

26:09.718 --> 26:11.587
- Huh?! You remember me?!
- Get off me!

26:11.588 --> 26:12.962
- Take it easy.
- You remember me?!

26:18.098 --> 26:19.522
BOBBY: Y'all got it all wrong.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.127
I don't know nothing
about that business.

26:21.128 --> 26:22.977
You're lying. Straight up.

26:22.978 --> 26:24.097
I swear to God. You were there!

26:24.098 --> 26:26.017
- I swear to God!
- I remember! I saw you!

26:26.018 --> 26:27.977
Shawnie, come on, man. Bobby,

26:27.978 --> 26:29.594
we just want to know what happened

26:29.595 --> 26:31.057
in the stump field that day, okay?

26:31.058 --> 26:33.386
We're gonna ask you a couple
of questions, then we'll leave.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.819
- I can't talk about that.
- Hey.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.890
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.
- You think we're playing games with you?

26:39.860 --> 26:40.997
Hey.

26:41.022 --> 26:42.779
Bobby, look at me. You were there

26:42.780 --> 26:44.859
in the stump field that day.
Red was there, too.

26:44.860 --> 26:47.634
We just want to know what happened.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
(sighs)

27:00.363 --> 27:02.402
It was that poison that was the problem.

27:03.750 --> 27:04.834
It was illegal.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.466
The warden couldn't have no one find out

27:07.491 --> 27:10.268
that he was having those kids
put it on them stumps, so...

27:10.860 --> 27:13.136
On the day that that kid
got the stump-killer...

27:13.137 --> 27:14.837
Petey. His-his name is Petey.

27:15.489 --> 27:16.318
Yeah?

27:18.849 --> 27:20.794
I never did bother to learn their names.

27:21.221 --> 27:22.380
Unless I had to.

27:23.489 --> 27:26.790
Anyway, the warden told me to bring

27:26.791 --> 27:28.976
the van around and pick that kid
up at the sally port.

27:29.331 --> 27:31.331
(tires squealing)

27:40.381 --> 27:42.390
It burns so bad! It's burning me up!

27:42.391 --> 27:44.390
Drive.

27:44.391 --> 27:47.220
PETEY: It burns! It burns!

27:47.221 --> 27:49.230
- (whimpering)
- All right, stop right here.

27:49.231 --> 27:52.310
Now put it in park, get out of the car.

27:52.311 --> 27:53.389
Now.

27:54.261 --> 27:55.380
Bobby, no! Please, Bobby, don't!

27:55.381 --> 27:58.310
- Get out of the car. Get out of the car!
- Bobby. Bobby, no.

27:58.311 --> 28:01.270
Bobby, please, no. Please,
don't-don't leave me with him!

28:01.271 --> 28:02.310
Bobby, don't go!

28:02.311 --> 28:04.270
- Please, Bobby!
- Shut up!

28:04.271 --> 28:06.310
Don't leave with him! No!

28:06.311 --> 28:08.260
Bobby, no! Please come back!

28:08.261 --> 28:11.260
No! Please! It hurts!

28:11.261 --> 28:12.430
No, please, Bobby, no!

28:12.431 --> 28:14.401
Don't leave me with him! No!

28:17.311 --> 28:18.739
Then what happened?

28:20.361 --> 28:21.875
What do you think happened?

28:22.058 --> 28:23.389
The warden told me he took care of it.

28:24.154 --> 28:26.350
Told me to stop asking stupid questions.

28:28.864 --> 28:30.596
I knew it was wrong, but...

28:32.391 --> 28:34.510
I don't know what else I could've done.

28:35.391 --> 28:37.949
JACKSON: So why don't you
do something about it now?

28:38.277 --> 28:39.286
Why don't you go on the record?

28:39.287 --> 28:41.366
You talk to us. Tell us everything

28:41.367 --> 28:43.366
you saw at Quitman
that didn't feel right.

28:43.367 --> 28:45.973
Oh, hell no. The warden would kill me.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.366
Don't worry about the warden, Bobby.

28:47.367 --> 28:49.213
I'm an attorney. I can protect you.

28:49.214 --> 28:52.286
Okay? We can get you out of here.

28:52.287 --> 28:55.497
Get you someplace nice.
No, uh... no humidity.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.968
Are you in the warden's
pocket now, Bobby?

29:01.297 --> 29:03.456
Or do you just respect the man
that much?

29:03.457 --> 29:05.123
Hell no, I hate that man.

29:07.129 --> 29:08.286
I haven't talked

29:08.287 --> 29:10.049
to that bastard in ten years, at least.

29:10.601 --> 29:12.452
Every time his fat face comes on the TV,

29:12.487 --> 29:14.951
- makes me want to be sick.
- Right now, Bobby.

29:14.952 --> 29:16.422
Now's the chance to do something.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.789
We're not after you.

29:19.157 --> 29:20.276
We want the warden.

29:21.207 --> 29:22.984
Help us take him down.

29:23.457 --> 29:26.704
Help us get some justice
for everything he did to you.

29:27.377 --> 29:28.991
To us. To...

29:29.457 --> 29:30.839
to Petey.

29:34.692 --> 29:36.486
(camcorder chimes)
You can do this,
Bobby.

29:37.007 --> 29:39.680
Right now, here, you can make it right.

29:40.337 --> 29:42.337
(beep)

29:42.600 --> 29:43.690
Tell me your name.

29:48.990 --> 29:50.479
Robert Allen Marks.

29:51.427 --> 29:54.942
Robert, did you ever work
as a correctional officer

29:54.943 --> 29:57.235
at the Quitman Youth Detention Facility?

29:57.580 --> 29:58.236
Yes.

29:59.827 --> 30:01.779
Between 1983 and 1990.

30:02.079 --> 30:03.669
Before it was privatized.

30:05.736 --> 30:07.605
Hey. What's wrong?

30:10.159 --> 30:13.308
I was going through his
things and I found this,

30:13.309 --> 30:15.662
hidden on a shelf in the closet.

30:24.079 --> 30:26.085
Why would Boots have a gun?

30:28.079 --> 30:29.278
I don't know.

30:31.758 --> 30:35.288
It's like I don't even know
the man that I was married to.

30:36.150 --> 30:37.989
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing.

30:38.956 --> 30:40.456
You know guys. They just...

30:41.129 --> 30:42.621
You know they like guns.

30:46.239 --> 30:47.915
I miss him.

30:48.932 --> 30:52.020
(groans) And I'm so angry with him.

30:53.558 --> 30:55.355
It just really, really sucks.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.596
I know.

30:57.951 --> 30:59.268
I'm sorry.

31:00.289 --> 31:02.788
(chuckles)

31:02.789 --> 31:06.218
And-and you-you know
what the worst part is?

31:06.219 --> 31:09.013
(chuckles) I don't know what to do.

31:10.139 --> 31:11.218
(chuckles, sniffles)

31:11.219 --> 31:14.572
I honestly have no idea what to do.

31:15.979 --> 31:16.956
That scares me.

31:19.199 --> 31:20.060
Come on.

31:21.579 --> 31:22.658
(exhales)

31:22.686 --> 31:24.685
Let's go. What for?

31:24.710 --> 31:26.051
'Cause I have an idea.

31:26.126 --> 31:27.490
Okay.

31:29.299 --> 31:31.462
This is where I used to come
when I was mad at my mom.

31:31.992 --> 31:33.289
Which was

31:33.290 --> 31:35.218
basically my entire childhood.

31:35.219 --> 31:37.288
(chuckles)

31:37.289 --> 31:39.307
This is where I first kissed Jackson.

31:39.308 --> 31:41.005
- Mmm.
- (chuckles) Mmm.

31:42.158 --> 31:43.832
This is where I came when he left.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.655
(exhales)

31:54.269 --> 31:57.127
(yells)

31:58.325 --> 31:59.992
(both chuckle)

32:00.718 --> 32:01.767
- You try. Come on.
- What?

32:01.795 --> 32:04.108
- Yeah, next.
- Ah. (grunts)

32:05.218 --> 32:07.307
Is that enough? (chuckles)

32:07.356 --> 32:09.465
- All right, give it a go.
- Okay.

32:10.319 --> 32:14.318
(yells)

32:14.552 --> 32:15.659
There you go.

32:15.739 --> 32:16.868
(both chuckle)

32:16.996 --> 32:18.369
You only got a free pass
'cause you're pregnant.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.945
- All right, all right.
- (chuckles)

32:19.946 --> 32:21.416
You brought the good stuff.

32:21.417 --> 32:22.818
Oh, yeah.

32:23.677 --> 32:24.746
Right there. Thank you.

32:24.747 --> 32:26.676
All right. (sighs)

32:26.677 --> 32:27.836
Cheers.

32:27.837 --> 32:29.847
Cheers. (chuckles)

32:32.072 --> 32:33.261
(sighs)

32:33.286 --> 32:35.255
There's something I just don't get.

32:35.524 --> 32:37.826
You said this morning that Jackson is

32:37.827 --> 32:41.065
this great guy, and you'd have
followed him anywhere.

32:41.525 --> 32:42.756
So, if he's so great,

32:42.757 --> 32:44.747
how come Boots never even mentioned him?

32:47.374 --> 32:49.240
You know they were at Quitman, right?

32:49.760 --> 32:50.797
Mm.

32:53.264 --> 32:56.445
Everything was just
different when they got out.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.459
And school was starting up, and

32:59.837 --> 33:01.836
Jackson was acting really strange,

33:01.837 --> 33:03.304
and then... Mm.

33:04.163 --> 33:05.427
...he just left.

33:05.727 --> 33:08.551
Just never even said good-bye.

33:11.727 --> 33:13.737
(sighs)

33:14.837 --> 33:16.865
Screw it.

33:17.687 --> 33:18.756
(groans)

33:18.757 --> 33:20.243
Boots was Irish.

33:20.787 --> 33:22.726
Think he'd be proud.

33:22.727 --> 33:23.907
(laughing)

33:24.687 --> 33:26.676
(grunts softly)

33:26.677 --> 33:27.837
Hmm.

33:28.837 --> 33:30.837
(sighs)

33:33.480 --> 33:35.025
To Boots.

33:36.206 --> 33:38.216
To Boots.

33:44.767 --> 33:46.836
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:49.870 --> 33:51.829
(sobbing)

33:51.830 --> 33:53.840
I'm-I'm sorry.

33:55.830 --> 33:58.032
I wish I could've done something else.

33:59.519 --> 34:01.126
GIL: Bravo!

34:01.710 --> 34:03.869
Somebody give this guy an Academy Award.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.428
You think that was easy?

34:05.429 --> 34:07.829
You bet your ass I do! You
blamed everybody but yourself.

34:07.830 --> 34:08.909
Poor little Bobby, just doing his job.

34:08.909 --> 34:10.097
Take it easy, Gil.

34:10.098 --> 34:12.197
Oh, come on, don't tell me
you believe this B.S.!

34:12.197 --> 34:13.909
Let's just get out of here, all right?

34:13.909 --> 34:16.719
(door slides open)

34:19.830 --> 34:21.710
You're pathetic.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.389
You did the right thing, Bobby.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.388
Thank you.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.810
(sniffles, sighs)

34:44.427 --> 34:45.545
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:45.547 --> 34:47.576
I liked having you hide out with me.

34:47.577 --> 34:49.406
Hide out?

34:49.407 --> 34:50.536
From Jackson.

34:50.536 --> 34:52.626
I've got two eyes in my head.

34:52.627 --> 34:54.545
You loved him.

34:54.547 --> 34:56.505
Oh, it was a long time ago.

34:56.507 --> 34:58.506
Well, I'd give anything

34:58.507 --> 35:00.506
to be able to talk to Boots again.

35:00.507 --> 35:02.536
And here you've got
that chance with Jackson.

35:02.537 --> 35:05.316
- It's complicated.
- Why?

35:05.317 --> 35:07.396
He's back in your life again.

35:07.397 --> 35:09.549
You haven't seen him
since he left Brennan, right?

35:09.550 --> 35:12.546
(grunts)

35:12.547 --> 35:14.396
(thunder rumbling)

35:14.397 --> 35:17.467
(grunts, sighs)

35:22.557 --> 35:24.476
(thunder crackling)

35:24.477 --> 35:26.245
No, I haven't.

35:26.270 --> 35:29.546
Well, then take advantage. Talk to him.

35:29.547 --> 35:31.516
Gil's a big boy.

35:31.517 --> 35:33.396
I'm sure he'll understand.

35:33.397 --> 35:35.131
- Yeah.
- Hey,

35:35.132 --> 35:38.118
- would you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

35:38.119 --> 35:41.407
Could you get rid of this gun for me?

35:43.250 --> 35:45.896
I just... I don't want it
lying around the house.

35:47.283 --> 35:48.492
Yeah.

35:48.493 --> 35:50.472
- Sure.
- Thank you.

35:50.473 --> 35:52.016
All right.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.362
You call me if you need anything, okay?

35:54.363 --> 35:55.482
Okay. No more wine!

35:55.483 --> 35:58.056
Don't want your sister
thinking I'm a bad influence.

35:58.057 --> 35:59.108
(laughing): Okay.

35:59.109 --> 36:02.283
- All right. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

36:07.323 --> 36:09.049
(loud gasping)

36:09.050 --> 36:11.776
Come on. It's all good, guys.

36:11.777 --> 36:13.213
We can work this out.

36:13.238 --> 36:14.286
(loud gasping)

36:14.311 --> 36:16.597
We can work this out! Come on!

36:16.598 --> 36:18.078
(groaning and gasping)

36:18.265 --> 36:20.657
Unfortunately,
this situation's non-negotiable,

36:20.658 --> 36:22.434
Mr. Air Marshall.

36:22.435 --> 36:25.324
I can't breathe! (high-pitched wheezing)

36:25.325 --> 36:27.325
I can't... I... (gasps)

36:29.285 --> 36:31.001
Now you can't breathe.

36:32.355 --> 36:34.355
(muffled chuckling)

36:37.365 --> 36:39.404
That's... that's funny.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.444
Yeah.

36:40.445 --> 36:42.284
- (clears his throat)
- (metallic clatter)

36:42.285 --> 36:43.464
Yeah.

36:43.465 --> 36:45.475
Cut him up.

36:52.064 --> 36:55.411
Honey, can I ask you to make
some of your famous guacamole?

36:55.578 --> 36:57.083
Sure. Why not?

36:57.084 --> 36:58.677
Jay loves my guacamole.

36:58.678 --> 37:00.647
- Don't you, little man?
- Hmm?

37:00.648 --> 37:02.577
Oh, look at that!

37:02.578 --> 37:04.577
Booty, booty, booty. (laughs)

37:04.578 --> 37:05.647
Come on, sweetheart.

37:05.648 --> 37:07.617
(laughs)

37:07.618 --> 37:09.618
(phone rings)

37:11.538 --> 37:12.627
Hello?

37:12.628 --> 37:15.587
Hey, it's Oscar.
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

37:15.588 --> 37:16.687
It's all right. What's up?

37:16.688 --> 37:18.667
So, I was following up
on the girlfriend's statement

37:18.668 --> 37:20.707
about the two guys she saw
outside Darryl's apartment.

37:20.708 --> 37:22.208
Mm-hmm.

37:22.209 --> 37:24.268
Guess who owns a gray Dodge truck?

37:25.708 --> 37:27.332
Gil Harris.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.525
Okay. Thank you.

37:37.708 --> 37:39.707
JACKSON: All right.

37:39.708 --> 37:41.081
That's a good day.

37:41.082 --> 37:42.850
- You think so?
- Yeah, I do.

37:42.875 --> 37:45.607
We're doing it the right way, Gil.

37:45.608 --> 37:47.341
We got a witness who was there.

37:47.342 --> 37:49.888
He went on camera, and
he told us everything he saw.

37:49.889 --> 37:52.450
- Which was nothing.
- Yeah, that's not true.

37:52.451 --> 37:54.832
He said the last person he saw
Petey with was the warden.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.082
- So?
- So if

37:56.107 --> 37:57.886
Petey's dead,
that's some damn good evidence

37:57.887 --> 38:00.354
right there, and Bobby gave us that.

38:00.379 --> 38:03.191
- The guy's a liar.
- How do you know?

38:03.884 --> 38:06.356
'Cause he said he wasn't
at the warden's parties.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.332
Was he?

38:14.300 --> 38:16.269
G...

38:16.344 --> 38:18.274
was Bobby at those parties?

38:19.737 --> 38:21.414
Doesn't matter. Whatever.

38:21.497 --> 38:23.296
Gil, man.

38:23.857 --> 38:26.806
I know it's hard,
but you got to be patient.

38:26.951 --> 38:30.991
Brick by brick, we're gonna
get it done, I promise you.

38:36.794 --> 38:39.853
You got somewhere to keep
this camera nice and safe?

38:40.247 --> 38:41.757
You're gonna leave it with me?

38:41.782 --> 38:43.892
Yeah, I'm gonna
leave it with you. I trust you.

38:46.394 --> 38:49.273
Good man.

38:49.568 --> 38:51.695
All right. Get out. I got to...

38:51.696 --> 38:52.976
I got to go. I'm in trouble.

38:52.977 --> 38:56.577
See, that's that common folk
talk I'm telling you about, bro.

38:56.578 --> 38:57.588
I know.

39:04.598 --> 39:07.638
(crickets chirring)

39:16.092 --> 39:18.061
(water lapping)

39:18.062 --> 39:20.011
(sighs)

39:20.012 --> 39:22.012
(sniffles)

39:24.012 --> 39:26.092
(sighs, sniffles) (phone beeps on)

39:27.404 --> 39:30.213
(crowd chatter, phone ringing)

39:30.341 --> 39:31.658
Hello?

39:31.683 --> 39:32.852
It's Bobby.

39:33.502 --> 39:35.522
I had some visitors today.

39:38.641 --> 39:40.026
I'm listening.

39:42.062 --> 39:44.044
Some of those boys from Quitman.

39:44.069 --> 39:45.278
Uh, some guy named

39:45.303 --> 39:48.272
Jason, a black guy, and...

39:48.648 --> 39:49.987
Gil Harris.

39:50.992 --> 39:52.892
They wanted to talk.

39:52.917 --> 39:55.829
Just... memories of Quitman.

39:56.552 --> 39:58.510
Stupid stuff, you know.

39:58.535 --> 40:00.820
I kicked 'em out
after, like, five minutes.

40:01.585 --> 40:03.062
It was nothing.

40:04.072 --> 40:06.162
I just thought you should know.

40:09.072 --> 40:11.002
(phone beeps off)

40:30.290 --> 40:33.166
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:35.420 --> 40:38.479
Marina, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.369
What's... what's my DEFCON level here?

40:41.370 --> 40:43.419
Like I said, all you had to do was call.

40:43.420 --> 40:46.299
Yeah, I know. I know, baby. We-we...

40:46.300 --> 40:48.409
We finished golf after nine holes, and

40:48.410 --> 40:51.379
the next thing I know, Joe wants
to show me his new boat.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.828
We're out in Kema, then I'm
bouncing around on the waves,

40:53.829 --> 40:56.479
trying not to get seasick,
and-and it... there's no...

40:56.480 --> 40:59.410
Baby, there's no cell phone
reception out there.

41:01.340 --> 41:02.701
I can't tell you how much

41:02.702 --> 41:04.467
I would've rather been with you today.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.459
I got to call your parents, don't I?

41:07.460 --> 41:08.495
Don't worry about it.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.399
You sent them a bottle of champagne

41:11.400 --> 41:13.859
and your sincerest apologies
for having to schmooze a client.

41:13.860 --> 41:14.726
You covered for me?

41:14.727 --> 41:16.039
- I did.
- You did?

41:16.040 --> 41:18.113
Oh, baby. Oh, you're amazing.

41:18.114 --> 41:20.389
- Okay, okay, you smell like fish.
- You're amazing.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.448
(laughs) I know.

41:21.449 --> 41:24.536
I'm sorry. I-I wanted to have
a shower all day, but first,

41:24.537 --> 41:26.771
I got... I got a little peace offering.

41:26.796 --> 41:27.741
This is a food bribe.

41:27.742 --> 41:29.484
That's semantics. Look.

41:29.509 --> 41:32.329
Chinese from Chang's,

41:32.436 --> 41:34.525
and I got you your favorite.
I got you the...

41:34.526 --> 41:36.355
(laughing): the lettuce cups.

41:36.356 --> 41:38.355
- Huh?
- How'd it go with Joe?

41:38.356 --> 41:40.565
Oh, it's, uh... fine.

41:40.566 --> 41:42.164
Business down the line.

41:42.165 --> 41:43.525
Just got to be patient.

41:43.526 --> 41:45.555
(whispers): I really, really love you.

41:45.556 --> 41:48.697
(whispers): But you
still smell like carp.

41:48.698 --> 41:50.032
Okay.
