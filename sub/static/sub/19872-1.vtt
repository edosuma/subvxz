00:18.919 --> 00:20.753
- And that was how we
saw our city tonight

00:20.755 --> 00:23.655
from your second
highest rated news team

00:23.657 --> 00:26.258
in the Peterborough and
Cortha Lakes Region.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.061
- Stay tuned next for Dr.
Nasty's Cavalcade of Horror

00:29.063 --> 00:30.529
on TV13.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.430
- What do they have on the
double feature tonight, Glenn?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.666
- Well first up we have
a film about a family

00:34.668 --> 00:37.069
of cannibals, followed by
one about a male sadist

00:37.071 --> 00:38.470
for hire escort.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.472
- Ew.

00:40.808 --> 00:41.974
- Will you be staying up late
to watch that one, Josie?

00:41.976 --> 00:43.342
- Absolutely not.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.678
The host of that show
is one sick fuck.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.948
- Did she just say
fuck on the air?

00:49.950 --> 00:52.351
- Don't worry, no one's
watching this anyway.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.833
- So what the hell
happened to the news desk?

01:07.835 --> 01:09.735
- Director sold it
to make a movie.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.736
- Naturally.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.205
- Set redress in 20 seconds.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.276
- Okay, who's been
stealing my beer nuts?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.510
- Come with me, doctor,
you only have one minute.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.412
- I'm serious on the nut thing.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.648
- What is she doing?

01:22.650 --> 01:27.086
- Oh, gosh, not again, doctor,
come on, we have to be on.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.154
Come on, we have to
get you on stage.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.223
- I'm going to have
to say hello, please.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.224
Wouldn't be polite otherwise.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.225
Hello.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.693
- I'm new here.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.994
- Yes, I could tell, I've
never seen you before.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.162
- Can you show me the ropes?

01:37.164 --> 01:38.997
- I can show you
a lot of things.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.467
Just be in my dressing
room the next break, okay.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.968
- There you go.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.870
- Get out of the way, I'm
trying to get my gloves on.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.405
- Get your position.

01:46.407 --> 01:49.208
- It's live
television, you know.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.477
I've been doing this for years.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.744
- The
Dr. Nasty show.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.780
- You always get in my
way, what are you, new?

01:54.782 --> 01:55.782
- Hold on.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.856
- Hello my troubled patients.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.660
Dr. Nasty here with another
late night double feature.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.797
Two really sick movies to
keep you up till morning.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.104
I'm your resident doctor
and this is my assistant,

02:52.106 --> 02:54.106
the lovely Nurse Nasty.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.343
What's our first
prescription for Ms. Nasty?

02:58.345 --> 03:02.514
- First, we have the cannibal
classic, Dinner for Monsters.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.484
- Ooh, well you look
good enough to eat.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.020
Perhaps we should carve you up.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.389
I think I'll skip the main
course and go straight

03:10.391 --> 03:11.790
to your dessert.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.832
- Remember when this
show used to be good?

03:20.834 --> 03:21.834
- Nope.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.408
- So, sit back and take
your double prescription

03:29.410 --> 03:32.477
for horror right
after this message.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.495
- No, still driving,
the meeting went late.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.897
I forgot.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.800
I forgot to book the
entertainment for the party.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.068
No, I remember who it was.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.436
It's a clown.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.904
Does anyone like clowns anymore?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.872
Is that a thing?

04:00.874 --> 04:04.209
Are you sure that
that's what he wants.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.679
Uncle Billy, right?

04:07.681 --> 04:11.917
It's Uncle Bobby's, yeah, I
got the poster right here.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.402
- Atta boy.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.038
Got a good lot to go.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.563
Bang it, you did it.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.432
- No, you didn't.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.350
- Next on TV13, the
feature Dinner for Monsters,

05:18.352 --> 05:20.919
then coming up at
2, Slit, followed

05:20.921 --> 05:23.322
by the Farm Report at 5 a.m.

05:54.421 --> 05:57.022
- How long have I
been sitting here for?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.658
Too long for a plate like this.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.861
Just as I expected, cold.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.029
- I'm sorry.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.330
I can get you another.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.065
- No, don't apologize.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.533
I've been coming here
for the past six months

06:08.535 --> 06:10.635
and it's no way close to
the way your father left it.

06:10.637 --> 06:14.206
If I were you, I'd close up
shop, because to be quite frank,

06:14.208 --> 06:15.874
there's probably more
flavor in my right arm

06:15.876 --> 06:18.777
than any dish I've
had here today.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.116
Good day.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.405
- Like you even
need to eat more.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.040
- Fuck!

06:49.042 --> 06:50.042
- Fuck!

06:56.350 --> 06:57.582
What?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.717
Hello, am I speaking

06:58.719 --> 06:59.951
to the restaurant's head chef?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.553
- Yeah, it's him.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.054
- This is Vincent
Debark calling in regards

07:03.056 --> 07:04.456
to the private
dinner party tonight.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.292
- You have the
wrong number buddy.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.729
Dinner for 6, yes.

07:10.731 --> 07:14.933
I was actually just prepping
some stuff right now.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.168
Getting real busy around here.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.203
I had to hire some
extra help actually.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.704
Just to remind you,

07:19.706 --> 07:21.273
dinner should be ready at my
hunting lodge by midnight.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.275
Feel free to bring whatever
you need for tools,

07:23.277 --> 07:24.543
we'd like to help you.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.778
Just remember we're
providing the roast.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.046
- Sure, yeah, perfect.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.181
Well, I'll see you tonight.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.649
I'm excited to meet you.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.118
And by the way, you know
what they say, bon appetit.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.654
Hello?

07:35.656 --> 07:36.656
Hello?

07:38.025 --> 07:39.025
Asshole.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.180
- Hi.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.215
- Hi.

08:03.217 --> 08:04.483
- I'm the chef tonight.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.750
I'm just looking for Vincent.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.320
I was hired for the dinner.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.888
- Yeah, of course.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.023
That's too bad.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.996
Let in our guest.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.065
- Why don't you come in?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.404
- Ah, our chef has arrived.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.473
- Thanks.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.941
- How do you do?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.743
I'm Vincent Debook, we spoke
earlier over the phone.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.878
- It's a pleasure,
thanks for having me.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.879
- Is it?

08:33.881 --> 08:34.880
- Sorry?

08:34.881 --> 08:36.815
- Is it a pleasure?

08:36.817 --> 08:41.052
It's just, on the phone
earlier, you seemed disgruntled.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.621
- Well.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.923
- Don't worry, perfectly
understandable.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.726
I mean, why would a man
like you want to spend

08:47.728 --> 08:50.195
his evening working for a
rich and powerful couple?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.430
I mean surely you, of
all people, have better

08:52.432 --> 08:54.065
things to do with your time.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.600
In fact, it might even save
your life for you to just

08:55.602 --> 08:57.402
turn around and leave right now.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.803
- Right, yeah.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.372
- I'm just busting
your chops, chef.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.640
You're staying with us tonight.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.941
- Yes, you are.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.477
Don't mind my husband.

09:05.479 --> 09:08.213
He clearly lacks any
and all social graces.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.848
Carmen.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.082
How do you do?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.289
I read about your
father in the paper.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.624
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.261
We were big fans
of his restaurant.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.765
Let's hope his talent
runs in the family.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.767
- Thanks.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.370
This is quite the place
you guys have here.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.106
- Aren't you sweet?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.576
Yes, we thought it
rustic and serene,

09:37.578 --> 09:40.345
so of course we had to buy it.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.582
- What do you guys do exactly?

09:43.584 --> 09:46.518
- Entrepreneurs of a sort.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.820
Now can I ask you a
personal question?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.121
- Sure, yeah.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.590
- Do you eat meat?

09:51.592 --> 09:52.757
- Do I eat meat, yeah.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.959
- Of course you do.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.193
After all you're a chef
and I don't suppose

09:55.195 --> 09:56.795
there are many chefs who
don't, now are there?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.763
Now I hate to preach,
but I'm afraid my friends

09:58.765 --> 10:00.632
and I just don't see
the pleasure in it.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.667
I mean, surely there
are alternatives,

10:02.669 --> 10:04.803
substitutions one could make
which are equally satisfying

10:04.805 --> 10:08.873
if not better than
animal, don't you agree.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.076
- Well, you know as a chef,
I'm trained to accommodate

10:11.078 --> 10:13.478
any dietary restrictions
that you guys might have.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.080
- My friends and I, we just
don't feel that animals deserve

10:15.082 --> 10:17.082
such vile treatment.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.917
I mean, why should they
have to suffer and die

10:18.919 --> 10:20.819
just for our selfish
tastes for meat?

10:20.821 --> 10:24.723
Take our friend on
the wall over here.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.760
A holdover from the previous
tenant, I assure you.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.095
So proud.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.162
So majestic.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.265
Once.

10:34.568 --> 10:37.669
Now just a tacky
bit of furnishing.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.137
I keep thinking I
should take him down,

10:39.139 --> 10:42.273
but wherever would I put him.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.542
Whatever would I
put in his place?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.778
- An ex-employee, perhaps?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.881
- And let me ask you this.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.616
Do cattle cause war?

10:52.552 --> 10:54.085
- No.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.587
- Cattle do not cause war,
no, no, all farm animals

10:55.589 --> 10:58.289
are guilty of is feeding
an every growing insatiable

10:58.291 --> 11:00.158
disgusting vile race-

11:00.160 --> 11:03.828
- Darling, darling,
don't work yourself up.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.366
Shall we take a tour
through to the kitchen.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.035
- Yeah, sure, sure.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.505
- This way.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.383
- Ah, kitchen.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.022
- Holy shit.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.491
- It's all yours for tonight.

11:34.728 --> 11:38.196
It's gorgeous, it's
state of the art.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.432
- Yes, well, you should
have everything you need.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.667
Let's check out the roast.

11:44.237 --> 11:48.039
Now, chef, the meal we're
asking you to prepare

11:48.041 --> 11:50.608
may not be one you're used to.

11:51.912 --> 11:55.980
- Yes, we prefer a
specific type of cuisine.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.248
- Are you guys vegan or?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.551
- No, not exactly.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.921
No, we prefer to
dine on humano carne.

12:02.923 --> 12:06.691
- Humano carne, is that
like Italian, German?

12:07.761 --> 12:08.827
- Sometimes.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.768
- What the fuck, what's this.

12:16.770 --> 12:20.105
- It's like how the French
refer to fattened duckling.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.606
It's fois Gras.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.842
Just somehow sounds tasty.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.079
- Are you kidding me?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.714
- No, why would we?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.617
Wouldn't you agree
that it's far smarter

12:32.619 --> 12:35.620
on cutting back the population
rather than feeding it?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.388
- No, I don't think
it's very smart to kill

12:37.390 --> 12:38.823
a human being and eat it.

12:38.825 --> 12:39.924
Okay, you guys are sick.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.659
You're sick.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.796
- Let's be civilized
about this, chef.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.132
My party and I are paying
you a handsome sum of money

12:47.134 --> 12:48.733
to be here tonight.

12:48.735 --> 12:49.768
- I don't care.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.769
- Oh, yes, you do, chef.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.771
You do.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.840
You see, I don't just
hire anyone without

12:55.842 --> 12:58.810
checking up on them first.

12:58.812 --> 12:59.944
Let's review.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.082
The chef here was once the
darling of the culinary academy,

13:04.084 --> 13:06.584
but add a few years
of heaving drinking,

13:06.586 --> 13:09.320
a few failed marriages, a
failed restaurant of your own

13:09.322 --> 13:12.257
and now, as I understand
it, a second restaurant,

13:12.259 --> 13:14.459
inherited from your
father upon his death,

13:14.461 --> 13:17.362
also on it's last course.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.998
Now take a look at the
man on the counter.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.699
He's nobody.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.102
Nothing but a slab of meat.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.604
No one will ever
trace him back to you

13:26.606 --> 13:28.006
or to this meal.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.376
- How do I know that?

13:31.378 --> 13:33.678
- By taking a look at me.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.413
Take a look around you, chef.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.817
I am a man of wealth,
respect and taste.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.020
I own four such properties
and this humble lodge

13:42.022 --> 13:44.455
will soon be renovated to
be the most state of the art

13:44.457 --> 13:46.024
in modern cuisine.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.093
Do you really think a man in
my position would jeopardize

13:49.095 --> 13:50.161
all of that?

13:52.632 --> 13:56.267
I understand your
concern, chef, I do.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.635
But you've been on this
planet long enough to know

13:57.637 --> 14:00.171
that there are two
kinds of people.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.807
You can be the hunter, like me.

14:05.912 --> 14:10.081
Or you can be the hunted,
like our friend on the slab.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.252
Decide what you'd rather be.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.593
- Come darling,
let us get ready.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.329
Our guests will be here soon.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.997
- All right, my dear.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.801
I think chef and I
understand each other now.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.138
Do call us when dinner's ready.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.273
I'm famished.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.651
- Go for the ribs.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.720
It's probably the
easiest way to do it.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.722
Slice.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.024
One slice, it's done.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.060
Just a piece of meat.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.998
Just a piece of meat.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.570
Just a piece of meat.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.876
What the fuck are you doing?

15:11.878 --> 15:13.278
What the fuck are you doing?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.947
How can you fucking do this?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.282
It's him or me.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.619
This guy's already dead.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.256
He's already fucking dead.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.760
If I don't do this,
I'll be fucking dead.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.675
- So I said to him, I said,
"If you won't eat it, I will."

15:46.880 --> 15:49.781
Oh, oh, oh, my
friend, my friend.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.984
Allow me to introduce
tonight's chef.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.986
- How do you do? Hello.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.990
- Now, chef, what
is our appetizer?

15:58.992 --> 16:02.327
- Yes, we're awfully
hungry, aren't we?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.561
- Well, I thought we'd
start the night off

16:03.563 --> 16:04.529
with something a
bit more lighter,

16:04.531 --> 16:06.597
a personal favorite of mine.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.901
Something I like to
call a Greek salad.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.443
- Where's the Greek?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.978
- Yeah, I really don't
think there's any meat

16:19.980 --> 16:21.746
in that salad at all.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.148
- Well, that's because
there's no meat in the recipe,

16:24.150 --> 16:26.617
but, you know, studies show
that if you start the night off

16:26.619 --> 16:29.554
with something a bit
more lighter and clean,

16:29.556 --> 16:31.756
you're consuming a
lot less calories.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.525
- Ch, ch, ch, less calories?

16:34.527 --> 16:35.927
- Did he just call us fat?

16:35.929 --> 16:36.928
- No.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.129
- I think he is.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.163
- I came here for
dinner with my friends

16:39.165 --> 16:41.399
and now I'm being insulted.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.201
Vincent, who is this guy?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.669
- That's not what I'm saying.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.903
- How would you feel if we said
something like that to you?

16:45.905 --> 16:46.838
- Yeah, you're not that
thin, either, buster.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.139
- I'm not calling you fat!

16:48.141 --> 16:49.141
- Chef!

16:50.276 --> 16:51.843
Excuse me.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.278
May I have a word, please.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
Excuse us.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.086
Now I'm sure if Vincent and
I were clear enough earlier,

17:02.088 --> 17:03.921
but you're here
to cook one thing.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.958
I don't care if it's your left
arm or that man's over there,

17:06.960 --> 17:11.695
but my husband, our guests and
I expect meat on our plates.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.665
Now, it's my turn to warn you.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.234
If you fail, I can assure you,

17:17.237 --> 17:20.038
you will be on
next week's plate.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.606
Do you understand?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.143
Good luck.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.446
- I can't do it.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.582
I can't do it.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.289
- Okay, come on, let's
just get this done.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.757
- What are you doing?

18:12.759 --> 18:16.494
- Look, I have seen a
lot of chefs come in here

18:16.496 --> 18:18.129
and very few leave.

18:19.499 --> 18:23.434
I just, I don't want you
to be another one of them.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.237
So, let's get cooking.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.216
- Let's listen to some music.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.398

18:54.400 --> 18:58.035

20:09.542 --> 20:11.509
- Yes, and you
should see the plot of land

20:11.511 --> 20:14.078
that we have behind the lodge.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.215
- Dinner is served.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.651
- Oh, chef, what
have you prepared for us?

20:20.653 --> 20:23.054
- We have a meal to die for.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.690
- We're all certainly famished.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.359
Please, tell us what
we'll be digging into.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.529
- Our entree this evening
is a man roast with rosemary

20:31.531 --> 20:34.065
and thyme with a side
of baked potato infused

20:34.067 --> 20:37.235
with garlic and bloody gravy.

20:37.237 --> 20:40.137
Ladies and gentleman,
bon appetit.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.543
Where did you find meat

20:45.545 --> 20:47.445
of this quality?

20:47.447 --> 20:50.615
- Well, you see it's
not in the body itself,

20:50.617 --> 20:52.984
but how the meat is prepared.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.187
We made sure he had the most
painful and shocking death.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.722
Isn't that right?

20:57.724 --> 20:59.290
- Yes, it's a little trick
I learned from the Chinese.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.726
You see they sometimes give
the animals stressful deaths

21:01.728 --> 21:03.861
to make the meat taste better.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.596
So, we simply raped his wife
and murdered his children

21:05.598 --> 21:07.632
in front of him and
then tortured him for

21:07.634 --> 21:09.434
and hour and a half
before flash freezing him.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.537
- Overkill.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.306
- Excuse me?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.974
- Nothing.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.478
- No, no, please, by
all means, speak up.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.547
- I was just thinking out loud.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.784
Is it really necessary
to do all that?

21:28.288 --> 21:32.089
- Well, I don't know,
why don't you try chef?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.191
- No, I'm okay.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.762
- But we insist, all of us.

21:37.764 --> 21:41.899
In fact, we won't have
another bite until you do.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.003
- No really, I'm okay guys.

21:47.373 --> 21:50.274
- One bite chef,
no more, no less.

21:53.479 --> 21:57.715
- You're not really the
negotiating type, are you?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.484
- Sit.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.525
- May I?

22:11.030 --> 22:13.664
Wouldn't want you to get dirty.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.071
- For you, chef's first bite.

22:23.142 --> 22:26.877
Let us all revel at the
awesome chef as he samples

22:26.879 --> 22:29.613
his first bite of
Human Con Carne.

22:52.138 --> 22:56.374
- But Vincent, you haven't
told our guests the best part.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.009
We froze the child.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.646
- Carmen never could keep
a secret, yes, that's true.

23:02.648 --> 23:03.948
I wanted to save this for later,

23:03.950 --> 23:07.785
but next week we are all
dining on honey baby.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.380
- Vincent do something!

23:38.518 --> 23:39.784
- How's it taste guys?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.085
How's it taste?

23:48.060 --> 23:49.360
Hey pretty boy.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.462
There you go!

23:53.199 --> 23:55.266
- We'll be right back.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.035
- Hey there horror
fans, Ken Riding here

23:58.037 --> 24:00.704
from KMR and Associates,
your mortgage broker.

24:00.706 --> 24:03.307
We'll get you back to Dr.
Nasty in just a minute,

24:03.309 --> 24:06.076
but we all know what really
keeps you up at night

24:06.078 --> 24:10.147
and that is paying too
much on your mortgage

24:10.149 --> 24:12.416
for your new home,
but don't worry.

24:12.418 --> 24:13.951
KMR has you covered.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.020
We'll slay that boogy
man because we've got

24:16.022 --> 24:17.922
killer mortgage rates.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.429
I slash the high prices
of the big banks.

24:29.135 --> 24:33.037
Choke out the competition
with my great deals.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.841
- Thank you KMR.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.375
- Thank you.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.777
- Thank you KMR.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.280
- Thank you KMR.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.586
- So, horror fans, for
killer mortgage rates,

24:48.588 --> 24:51.155
come and sign with KMR.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.824
You'll get more than
what you bargained for.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.833
- Now back to Dr.
Nasty's Cavalcade of Horror.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.820
- Hey, what's going on?

25:40.072 --> 25:42.673
- Beautiful, isn't it.

25:42.675 --> 25:46.577
You won't find a better
selection on any menu.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.568
- Say one word and
this bitch gets it.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.673
- You asked us what
we did for a living.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.743
Let me tell you chef,
there's quite the market

26:19.745 --> 26:21.078
for human meat.

26:23.916 --> 26:27.384
Well, feast your eyes
on a year's supply.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.653
Carmen and I have been
working on our collection

26:29.655 --> 26:30.888
for some time.

26:32.391 --> 26:36.126
It was difficult at
first, culling the herd,

26:37.196 --> 26:41.231
without anyone noticing,
learning the optimal

26:41.233 --> 26:45.302
means of harvesting, but
with time and practice,

26:46.372 --> 26:49.940
of course, plenty of
that, we made it an art.

26:52.545 --> 26:54.144
The one thing we never
got the hang of, though,

26:54.146 --> 26:58.382
was the cooking, which, of
course is why you are here.

26:59.719 --> 27:03.420
If you won't be one of
us, you'll be one of them.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.024
- I was insane to
cook you that meal.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.959
- You're just like your father.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.628
- You didn't know my father.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.597
- Maybe not all that well,
but I know he was a man

27:13.599 --> 27:15.499
with very great taste.

27:59.679 --> 28:02.513
- What did you
think of the meat?

28:04.884 --> 28:07.718
- Let's have a little taste.

28:15.528 --> 28:16.994
- No, no, no, no.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.587
- One more slab of
meat for the meat pile.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.435
- I got something else in mind.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.884
- Well, chef, I don't know
how you did it, but bravo.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.219
- Thank you, sir.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.421
- The flavor, the
presentation, the taste.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.323
All of it is just outstanding.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.692
It's discovery of an
urban flavor that I just

29:21.694 --> 29:23.894
can't put my finger on.

29:23.896 --> 29:27.765
You do have to tell me, what's
the secret to this roast?

29:27.767 --> 29:31.635
- Well, if you must know,
it's a little something

29:31.637 --> 29:34.037
I like to call humano carne.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.941
- Well, I've never
heard of that before,

29:37.943 --> 29:39.610
but it's delectable.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.311
How about another slice
please, but this time

29:41.313 --> 29:42.980
I want it bloodier.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.983
- Coming right up.

30:44.677 --> 30:45.677
- Oh, baby.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.423
- Gopher Sam.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.225
Where are you Sam?

31:01.227 --> 31:02.492
- Yeah, Shawn, I'll
have these call sheets

31:02.494 --> 31:04.061
done in a moment.

31:04.063 --> 31:07.497
- Never mind that, cue the
doctor, we're on in five.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.507
- Orson, Shawn's
already talked to me.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.643
I'll have everything
after the next film.

31:19.645 --> 31:22.613
- I can get the doctor, you
just get ready to go live.

31:22.615 --> 31:23.814
- I just found out about these

31:23.816 --> 31:25.315
after movie guests
an hour a ago.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.318
I can't even find
their IMDB page.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.821
Are they even real actors?

31:30.823 --> 31:32.556
- You work too hard.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.231
- Where'd I put my boobs?

31:49.975 --> 31:50.975
Wow.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.378
I bet that bitch has my wig.

32:18.704 --> 32:19.704
- Uh, uh.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.776
- Give me back my wig.

32:25.778 --> 32:29.479
John we're on the
air on four minutes.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.014
- I was almost done.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.983
And don't call me John.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.059
- Your turn.

32:45.864 --> 32:46.864
- No.

32:54.206 --> 32:58.208
Getting a little
young aren't we John?

32:58.210 --> 33:00.344
- That girl's got talent.

33:02.381 --> 33:06.316
You on the other hand
need to watch yourself.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.452
What are you, pushing 30?

33:09.822 --> 33:12.356
A few prospects working
on a bargain basement show

33:12.358 --> 33:13.790
like this.

33:13.792 --> 33:17.828
Me, I know I'm washed
up, but I can still get

33:17.830 --> 33:22.032
just about any starlet to
fuck an old geezer like me

33:22.034 --> 33:23.034
for a part.

33:26.138 --> 33:30.440
Think I'm any different than
that director friend of yours?

33:30.442 --> 33:32.042
You watch.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.343
He's gonna kick you
to the curb the moment

33:33.345 --> 33:34.978
he's done with you.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.620
We all have our part to play.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.089
You need to learn your place.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.340
- Okay, ready, and 10, 9, 8-

34:03.342 --> 34:04.408
- Where my cast?

34:04.410 --> 34:05.876
- They're getting in position.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.577
- Cue the doctor.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.080
- And we're live.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.083
- Rock and roll.

34:14.085 --> 34:18.855
- I bet that last movie made
you lose your midnight snack.

34:18.857 --> 34:22.458
Let's see if Ms.
Nasty can help us.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.530
Ms. Nasty likes to feel a
little pain from the doctor.

34:26.532 --> 34:27.998
- No, doctor, no.

34:29.101 --> 34:33.402
- Our next rarely seen
feature is called Slit.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.972
For all you late night sloths.

34:37.009 --> 34:39.943
- Right after this commercial.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.956
- He was half man, half beast,

34:52.958 --> 34:55.759
living off the world
he loved so dear.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.894
Encephalopithecus.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.163
A man and a woman
steeped in the throws

35:00.165 --> 35:01.998
of their own passions.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.633
Little did they know
they were not alone

35:03.635 --> 35:06.570
when they soiled
his sacred ground.

35:07.906 --> 35:12.175
From Felix Broncowitz, producer
of I Suck From Your Arteries

35:12.177 --> 35:14.678
and Dance Recital Massacre
comes a new generation

35:14.680 --> 35:16.713
of backwoods terror.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.983
Filmed in glorious
Betavision black and white.

35:19.985 --> 35:23.386
He hears you, he sees
you, he wants you.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.389
Encephalopithecus.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.992
Come see the film and
survive the terror

35:28.994 --> 35:33.497
the Toronto Film Herald
calls relatively in focus.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.599
Encephalopithecus.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.435
He's been waiting
for you to die.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.605
Now playing at Diamond Cinemas,

35:41.607 --> 35:44.341
214 Townhill Road, Peterborough.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.382
Now to our feature presentation.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.806
- In
further news, police revealed

36:16.808 --> 36:18.008
more information regarding
the gruesome discovery

36:18.010 --> 36:19.576
of a mutilated human
body found in a dumpster

36:19.578 --> 36:21.912
behind the local shopping mall.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.446
Police say that the body
is believed to be that

36:23.448 --> 36:25.482
of a man, but
indication of gender

36:25.484 --> 36:27.884
was difficult to ascertain
as the body has suffered

36:27.886 --> 36:29.452
a number of severe lacerations.

36:29.454 --> 36:33.723
The body was found in the
early hours of Tuesday morning

36:33.725 --> 36:36.560
by county workers when
emptying the dumpster.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.828
Police announced today
that they are now treating

36:38.830 --> 36:40.797
the case as a homicide.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.467
Initial conclusions released
by the coroner's office

36:44.469 --> 36:47.804
suggested the cause of the
laceration and dismemberment

36:47.806 --> 36:50.040
would have to have been a
long and sharp instrument,

36:50.042 --> 36:54.244
most likely a kitchen knife
or other cutting tool.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.179
Though no further information
has been made public yet,

36:56.181 --> 36:58.548
police say they are working
closely with the forensics

36:58.550 --> 37:00.951
and missing peoples
department in order

37:00.953 --> 37:02.385
to identify the remains.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.154
However, due to the
state of the remains,

37:04.156 --> 37:06.556
this may take some time.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.225
Police have conducted
searches of the local area

37:08.227 --> 37:12.762
and questioned locals where
the remains were discovered.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.465
As part of the ongoing
investigation, police are urging

37:15.467 --> 37:18.235
anyone who may have some
information to please go forward

37:18.237 --> 37:20.870
with anything that
may be valuable

37:20.872 --> 37:22.606
to the ongoing investigation.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.007
We will of course keep
you update on the story

37:24.009 --> 37:26.576
as information comes to light.

37:51.136 --> 37:52.669
- You hear about this guy?

37:52.671 --> 37:53.637
- What guy?

37:53.639 --> 37:55.639
All over the 12:00 news.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.673
- Good news or bad news?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.608
- What do you think?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.344
TV said they found the deceased
in a fast food dumpster

38:01.346 --> 38:02.746
behind the mall.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.949
Indignity to the remains.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.953
Internet says the killer had
a knife, used it everywhere.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.588
Genitals removed, face.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.590
- I get it.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.325
- What's the matter?

38:15.327 --> 38:18.795
You don't like hearing
about your competition?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.297
- My competition?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.099
Where'd you hear this shit?

38:23.101 --> 38:26.603
- Man, it's the
word on the street.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.339
- I don't do shit out and about.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.444
- You didn't do it did you?

38:34.446 --> 38:37.280
You wouldn't kill somebody?

38:37.282 --> 38:40.150
- Jesus, you're paranoid.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.851
You really think that's me.

38:41.853 --> 38:42.919
I don't even know
what I would charge

38:42.921 --> 38:44.554
for something like that.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.723
- But you cut, don't you.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.460
- This is a niche
service, Michael.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.162
Not a thrill, it's a business.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.596
I relieve people.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.098
I'm not crazy.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.232
- Are you sure?

38:56.234 --> 38:58.001
- Not at work.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.637
What are you, paranoid bastard?

39:01.807 --> 39:05.809
- Well, we're all a
little funny aren't we?

39:05.811 --> 39:06.843
- I suppose.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.651
- You ought to get a
doctor's office or something

39:14.653 --> 39:16.119
with a waiting room, you know.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.587
- With magazines.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.491
- Yeah, and a sexy
bitch secretary.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.496
- To be honest, I don't
really mind the hike.

39:26.498 --> 39:29.366
It's nice to get out of the
house very once in a while.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.867
- Yeah, for what?

39:32.037 --> 39:34.104
That shit hole out there?

39:34.106 --> 39:35.106
No thanks.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.308
- You got too much to
occupy yourself with here.

39:38.310 --> 39:39.876
- That's the idea.

39:41.313 --> 39:45.915
So, what kind of degenerate
you got lined up next?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.318
- Some girl downtown.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.220
She called me last night.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.756
She's new, so we'll
see how it goes.

39:52.758 --> 39:53.758
- She cute?

39:55.861 --> 39:57.560
- It was out of the
blue when she called.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.696
Said she needed it bad.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.765
- Yeah, I've been there.

40:03.568 --> 40:07.804
- Michael, you haven't given
out my phone number, have you?

40:10.475 --> 40:12.842
- Well, no, 'cause
somebody said it was

40:12.844 --> 40:14.411
against the rules.

40:15.347 --> 40:17.247
You got to trust me more man,

40:17.249 --> 40:19.516
you're the one with the knife.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.784
You don't know her, so what?

40:20.786 --> 40:21.786
- So what?

40:23.021 --> 40:24.687
I'm not going to open myself
up to every pervert fuck

40:24.689 --> 40:27.023
wasting in the alley, okay?

40:30.829 --> 40:33.930
- I didn't give your
number out to anybody.

40:33.932 --> 40:38.168
I don't know anybody else
that's even into this shit.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.370
You'll be okay.

40:40.372 --> 40:43.640
Can we go back to you
trusting me again?

40:43.642 --> 40:47.477
I'm sorry I asked you
about killing that guy.

40:50.182 --> 40:51.748
Listen, I need it.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.218
Your services.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.257
- And I need yours.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.693
- You thief.

41:05.197 --> 41:06.896
- See you next week.

41:07.999 --> 41:11.034
More updates regarding

41:11.036 --> 41:13.002
the human remains
discovered in a dumpster

41:13.004 --> 41:15.672
behind the King Fisher shopping
mall have just come in.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.373
The police have announced
that they've been able

41:17.375 --> 41:19.442
to identify the body
as that of 26-year old

41:19.444 --> 41:21.244
Jeffrey Williford, a resident

41:21.246 --> 41:23.046
from the lower west end of town.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.048
His next of kin
have been contacted,

41:25.050 --> 41:26.449
but as of yet have
not issued a statement

41:26.451 --> 41:28.318
about the discovery.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.286
Friends say that he worked nights
at a fast food restaurant,

41:30.288 --> 41:32.922
including the night prior
to his body's discovery.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.358
Police are questioning his
co-workers and friends,

41:35.360 --> 41:37.427
but continue their request
for members of the public

41:37.429 --> 41:39.295
to come forward if the
have any information

41:39.297 --> 41:41.431
that could help with
the investigation.

41:41.433 --> 41:45.401
We'll keep you informed
of any further updates.

42:17.102 --> 42:20.403
- Hey, mister, do you have
some change for the bus, man?

42:20.405 --> 42:21.804
- No, sorry.

42:21.806 --> 42:22.839
- Like a five or anything
that will help me,

42:22.841 --> 42:24.073
you know what I mean.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.877
- I said fuck off,
I'm using my change.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.946
- You got a bad attitude, man.

42:29.948 --> 42:31.080
- Yeah, well.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.722
- Excuse me.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.124
Are you Bradley?

42:49.768 --> 42:52.735
- So how do you like
the building so far?

42:52.737 --> 42:56.639
- Good, before
the power was cut off.

42:57.509 --> 42:59.776
I don't know, it's all right.

42:59.778 --> 43:01.277
It's a hideout for me.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.879
- How long you been here?

43:02.881 --> 43:04.414
- Not long.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.736
I haven't really laid down
roots or anything, you know.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.904
You got roots?

43:10.905 --> 43:12.855
- I got piles of
junk of that's what you mean.

43:12.857 --> 43:14.991
I don't know about roots.

43:17.462 --> 43:18.628
- This is it.

43:20.365 --> 43:21.764
My bachelor pad.

43:23.969 --> 43:25.768
Do you want anything?

43:26.838 --> 43:28.171
- Like what?

43:28.173 --> 43:29.472
- Like a drink.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.176
- We should get started.

43:33.178 --> 43:35.244
It's our first time
working together

43:35.246 --> 43:38.648
and I'm gonna go over
a couple of rules.

43:46.091 --> 43:48.324
- Where do you want me to?

43:50.395 --> 43:52.829
- Lay down and I can go
your back or some sit

43:52.831 --> 43:55.932
if they like it
done to their legs.

43:55.934 --> 43:57.567
- What do you like?

43:58.937 --> 44:01.070
- Whatever you're paying.

44:05.877 --> 44:10.046
- So how does one get into
this sort of profession?

44:11.383 --> 44:12.383
- Demand.

44:13.084 --> 44:14.917
- So you're a cutting whore?

44:14.919 --> 44:16.819
- I'm an entrepreneur.

44:18.156 --> 44:19.922
- It's amazing what you can
find to do in this city.

44:19.924 --> 44:22.158
- Look, I got two rules.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.061
- Oh, promise, I
won't be naughty.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.031
- I'm sure you won't.

44:29.300 --> 44:30.299
That phone number you have,

44:30.301 --> 44:32.435
that needs to stay a secret.

44:32.437 --> 44:33.836
I don't know what kind
of crowd you run with

44:33.838 --> 44:35.772
or how you got my
number, but that never

44:35.774 --> 44:37.273
should have happened.

44:37.275 --> 44:38.508
There's a lot of
weirdos in this town

44:38.510 --> 44:39.575
and I'm not about
to start handing

44:39.577 --> 44:41.911
my information out to them.

44:43.915 --> 44:47.750
Rule number two, because
it's the first time,

44:48.553 --> 44:49.719
pay me first.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.844
So what would you like?

45:16.014 --> 45:17.014
- My back.

45:19.818 --> 45:22.618
And then I'll flip over.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.020
- Get undressed.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.140
- I'm ready.

45:51.382 --> 45:53.116
- You hired me at your own risk.

45:53.118 --> 45:54.118
- Yeah.

45:57.622 --> 46:00.389
- All right, my instruments
have been sanitized

46:00.391 --> 46:02.725
thoroughly after each session.

46:02.727 --> 46:04.127
That being said, if you don't
take care of your wounds

46:04.129 --> 46:07.730
properly, I can't protect
against infection.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.233
You understand?

46:10.235 --> 46:11.235
- Yes.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.372
- Where do you want it?

46:19.811 --> 46:20.977
- Right here.

46:25.450 --> 46:28.851
- I'll only go as far
as you want me to.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.454
One more thing.

46:33.191 --> 46:37.160
If you record any of
this or report it,

46:37.162 --> 46:39.562
I will catch up to you.

46:41.065 --> 46:42.732
- And do what?

46:42.734 --> 46:44.634
How does a cutter
punish somebody?

46:44.636 --> 46:45.868
- Are you ready?

46:45.870 --> 46:46.870
- Yeah.

47:00.218 --> 47:01.284
- You okay?

47:01.286 --> 47:03.786
- No, keep going, keep going.

47:49.801 --> 47:53.102
- Maybe you'd prefer
a different knife.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.340
- Brii stop.

47:57.342 --> 47:59.208
- There's magic
there, just listen up.

47:59.210 --> 48:02.211
You and I can do this together.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.546
I saw the way that
you looked at me.

48:03.548 --> 48:05.715
I saw the way that
you looked at my arms.

48:05.717 --> 48:08.117
Torture anyone Bradley.

48:08.119 --> 48:09.185
- Brii stop!

48:10.321 --> 48:11.554
That's enough.

48:19.430 --> 48:20.663
I'm done here.

49:24.896 --> 49:26.095
I'm sorry.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.797
You might have got
the wrong impression.

49:27.799 --> 49:29.699
I think it's best that I leave.

49:29.701 --> 49:31.600
- You're not going anywhere.

49:31.602 --> 49:32.602
- Ah!

50:01.632 --> 50:03.532
- That's more like it.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.875
What's the matter Bradley?

50:12.877 --> 50:14.343
You know how many
guys would kill

50:14.345 --> 50:17.113
to be with a sweet girl like me?

50:17.115 --> 50:20.349
Someone who's looking
for a good time?

50:24.188 --> 50:28.424
I thought you would understand
that, you selfish fuck!

50:35.833 --> 50:38.067
What's the matter Bradley?

50:38.870 --> 50:41.537
Am I not pretty enough for you?

50:46.644 --> 50:47.777
What's the matter Bradley?

50:47.779 --> 50:50.446
Am I not pretty enough for you?

50:52.216 --> 50:53.216
Huh?

50:54.085 --> 50:55.085
Am I?

51:16.874 --> 51:18.874
What about now Bradley?

51:20.545 --> 51:21.545
Well, am I?

53:18.729 --> 53:19.729
- Aw, fuck.

53:33.010 --> 53:34.010
Aw fuck.

53:40.451 --> 53:41.451
Aw fuck.

54:04.375 --> 54:05.375
Fuck.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.488
Fuck.

54:46.784 --> 54:47.983
Atlanta Pizza.

54:47.985 --> 54:50.025
- I need a large pizza,
525 Western Heights,

54:52.490 --> 54:53.105
Apartment 2B.

54:53.106 --> 54:53.721
- Okay,
what would you like on it?

54:53.724 --> 54:56.225
- I don't give a shit,
just give it here fast.

54:56.227 --> 54:57.259
Okay, that'll be 14-

54:59.864 --> 55:00.864
- Fuck.

55:10.241 --> 55:11.241
Aw, fuck.

55:21.719 --> 55:22.719
Fuck!

56:00.458 --> 56:01.458
- Shit.

57:48.466 --> 57:50.532
- You stay there.

57:53.904 --> 57:58.140
You know, I think you and I
got off on the wrong foot.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.712
I just don't think
you understand.

58:05.749 --> 58:09.918
I'm actually a pretty
fucking smart girl, Bradley.

58:11.021 --> 58:14.156
I've just been fucked
over too many times.

58:14.158 --> 58:15.157
You know what?

58:15.159 --> 58:17.426
We do it to ourselves.

58:17.428 --> 58:21.730
Our fate, we just don't
realize until it's too late

58:21.732 --> 58:25.501
and we start having flashbacks
to when we were kids.

58:25.503 --> 58:29.738
Then you got the lies of
your mother and the scars

58:29.740 --> 58:32.241
from your father
splitting your insides

58:32.243 --> 58:34.977
and pulling everything
from inside you to opposite

58:34.979 --> 58:36.478
ends of the room.

58:37.815 --> 58:39.047
You know what?

58:41.485 --> 58:43.919
You realize that you
would rather be crushed

58:43.921 --> 58:46.989
like a coreless fruit
in an angry god's hand.

58:46.991 --> 58:48.190
You just want to die.

58:48.192 --> 58:50.526
You cut from the outside in.

58:50.528 --> 58:54.429
You try to get to what's
inside and kill that.

58:57.334 --> 59:01.336
You, guys like you, Brad,
you just keep cutting.

59:01.338 --> 59:05.574
You don't fucking care
about getting to the inside.

59:06.377 --> 59:08.076
You just keep cutting.

59:08.078 --> 59:11.179
Guys like you take
whatever the fuck they want

59:11.181 --> 59:13.048
and then they fuck off and
they leave girls like me

59:13.050 --> 59:16.852
to sit around and hate
themselves afterwards.

59:17.955 --> 59:20.222
We're the ones sitting
there hating ourselves,

59:20.224 --> 59:23.525
but you're the one
who's fucking us up.

59:27.665 --> 59:29.598
You keep cutting, but do
you actually think about

59:29.600 --> 59:32.267
what you're doing to yourself?

59:32.269 --> 59:33.569
Don't you know that you're
just hurting yourself

59:33.571 --> 59:36.338
and you're going to end
up with this in the end?

59:36.340 --> 59:37.806
Huh?

59:37.808 --> 59:39.641
What would you have done
if you had somebody like me

59:39.643 --> 59:41.176
the first time that you
ever dragged your blade

59:41.178 --> 59:44.179
across some soul-less,
helpless little fuck

59:44.181 --> 59:47.683
who just wanted to
feel something again.

59:47.685 --> 59:48.684
But you don't stop.

59:48.686 --> 59:51.386
You don't fucking stop, do you.

59:51.388 --> 59:54.690
Well, it's not your
turn anymore, Brad.

59:55.593 --> 59:56.593
Yeah.

59:57.628 --> 59:58.827
It's my turn.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:02.364
How about we start doing
things my way, hmm?

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:05.400
How about that.

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:06.702
How about you sit
there, you sit there

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:09.438
and be good and quiet this time.

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:13.942
Yeah, we'll do things my way.

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:16.945
You like that?

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:19.849
Yeah?

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:23.719
What's wrong,
what's wrong, Brad?

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:35.797
Am I pretty enough for you?

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.071
Fuck you.

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:02.150
- Hello?

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:03.719
- Are you Michael?

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:18.200
- What the fuck?

01:02:18.202 --> 01:02:20.335
Wake up, we got dead air.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.003
- Go to camera one.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.709
Okay, we'll go to camera two.

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:34.916
- Wasn't that just
painfully scary.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.918
Makes me tingle in
all the wrong places

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.020
just thinking about it.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:40.589
How about you Nurse Nasty?

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.691
- Oh, yes, doctor.

01:02:42.693 --> 01:02:44.259
Stay tuned for our
interview segment

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.527
where I'll be talking to-

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.162
- You, Nurse Nasty?

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:52.601
Are you sure that your
empty little brain

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.637
can handle that all on your own?

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:57.305
- Of course with
your help, doctor.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:58.774
- Right, my help.

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:03.445
Some people like a
little throbbing pain,

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:04.846
don't they Nurse Nasty.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:06.581
- Yes, doctor.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:08.083
I know I do.

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:09.684
I bet you do.

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:11.586
I bet you like it
when people use you

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:15.824
for their own ends like a
whore, wouldn't you say?

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:21.196
You know, wait, no,
no, no, I'm wrong.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:25.233
At least a whore gets some
kind of payoff in the end.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:29.137
- Stick to the script
you washed up alcoholic.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.240
- Nurse Nasty.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:37.746
You shouldn't talk like that.

01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:40.782
You've been very, very naughty

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:45.220
and I think I'm going
to have to punish you.

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:46.222
- John, no.

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:01.704
- Shit.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:04.639
Cut to commercial.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.009
- Okay, what the
hell is going on.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.145
- Hey, it's show biz.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:11.379
- You asshole.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.747
- All right, everybody
just calm down.

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:15.984
Orson get her out
of this contraption.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.022
- Is that blood?

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.490
I'm bleeding.

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:24.459
Oh, you know that
you're fired right?

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.528
- Says the girl who
takes the garbage out

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:27.729
at the end of the night.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:30.232
- Oh, I can so have you fired.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:31.234
- Go ahead.

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:34.603
I'd much rather to have
you pay me to sit at home

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:37.539
than to have to read that
shit off the teleprompter.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.008
In fact, how about I leave now.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.010
- No, John.

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:43.879
All right, everybody,
let's just take a breath.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.447
No one is firing anybody.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.717
- But Shawn, did you see
what that asshole did to me?

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:50.285
- I'll talk to you
about this later.

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:51.287
- Orson.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.656
No, not later.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.094
You need to fucking
fire him now.

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:03.765
- Sam, I said I'll talk
to you about this later.

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:07.435
- Uh, we're supposed
to be on in one minute.

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:10.338
- Right, put on
the extended spot

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.874
and get set up for
the interviews.

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:17.479
And you, John, for Christ's
sake, just sober up, man.

01:05:59.923 --> 01:06:02.324
- How are you doing?

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:06.261
- How do you think I'm doing?

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.401
I'm just got whipped by a drunk
maniac on live television,

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:15.503
Shawn, and you're telling me
that I have to back out there

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:17.706
and take more of it.

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:21.042
You should have
fucking fired him.

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.712
- He has an iron clad contract.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:29.050
We can't afford paying him
and to hire a replacement.

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:31.519
- I can do the show
on my own, John,

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.455
you know I could.

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.523
I practically do it already.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:39.227
- I know, you're the
best actress I know.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:41.396
But we need him for this show,

01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:44.199
at least for a
little bit longer.

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:50.138
- I can't do this anymore.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.409
- I know.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:55.778
I know.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.712
And you know what?

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.748
I hate this as much as you do.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.950
And if we weren't so close
to getting the financing

01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:03.718
to get our feature
film off the ground,

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.220
you know what?

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:07.088
I would tel that son of a
bitch to fuck right off.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.690
- You've been telling
me the same lines

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.525
for the last five years, Shawn.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.027
But you know what?

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:16.264
What you did out there,
sticking up to that monster,

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:19.000
that was the last fucking straw.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:23.905
- We need him or our
investors will walk.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:28.243
- I don't care about
the movie or the show,

01:07:28.245 --> 01:07:30.078
any of it Shawn.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080
I'm done.

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:38.420
- What are you doing?

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:39.422
- Packing.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:44.292
- So you're just leaving?

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:46.294
After all the work we've done?

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:48.029
- We, what we Shawn?

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:53.968
Do we even have a relationship?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.942
- All I know is that we
need to focus on work.

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:05.480
- And it's my work, my
ideas that has gotten

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:07.882
us this far and you know
what, you've just been along

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:10.452
for the girls and the parties.

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:13.721
I'm done, okay,
and I'm not going

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:16.524
to be your work
horse any longer.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.028
- I don't think
of you like that.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.895
- Yes, you do.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:23.131
You know what?

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:27.769
When I go Shawn, all
of this goes with me.

01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:32.107
Like making your movie without
the production schedule,

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:35.076
the tax credit forms, you
know, the call sheets,

01:08:35.078 --> 01:08:36.644
you might need those Shawn.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.613
- Okay, Sam, come here.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.287
Come here.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:50.859
I'm sorry.

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:56.731
That bastard really
hurt you, didn't he?

01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:01.736
If it means that much
to you, I'll fire him.

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:02.738
- Really?

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.307
- Yes.

01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:09.444
Look, he's replaceable.

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:11.279
It's you that I need.

01:09:12.549 --> 01:09:14.515
We're a team, remember?

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:19.020
- What about his contract?

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:24.325
- Just don't worry
about that, okay.

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:40.376
We good?

01:09:41.978 --> 01:09:46.113
- No, you can be a
fucking bastard sometimes,

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:47.849
you know that right?

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:52.319
- I know but that's
why you love me.

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:11.573
- Sorry, they need
you on the set.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:15.076
We go live in one minute.

01:10:15.078 --> 01:10:16.411
- Thanks Orson.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:21.182
Look, baby, why don't you just
sit this one out, all right?

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:22.483
I'll let John deal
with the interviews

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:26.120
and then I'll give him
the good news after.

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:31.459
- Yeah, as long as I get to
be there when you fire him.

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.461
- Deal.

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:39.434
Orson, take her somewhere
where she can be comfortable,

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:42.870
maybe put some ice on her back.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.172
- Thanks.

01:10:56.319 --> 01:10:57.885
- Okay, you crazy kids.

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:01.756
We've got two guests that
were on both of the features.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.625
Can you introduce yourselves?

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:05.660
- I'm Danny, I played
a person in the barn

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:07.595
on Dinner for Monsters.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.632
I believe you see my elbow.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:14.869
- I play the pizza delivery
boy in the movie Slit.

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.904
- Well, don't we get
the big names here

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:19.941
on Dr. Nasty's
Cavalcade of Horror.

01:11:37.027 --> 01:11:38.027
- No.

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:45.433
This place is crazy.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:50.138
I mean do I actually have
a job where I get whipped.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.275
- I've always loved that
tattoo on your shoulder.

01:11:55.178 --> 01:11:56.178
- That?

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.614
I didn't know you'd seen that.

01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:02.583
I did it to pay tribute
to my late mother.

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:05.086
She always loved butterflies.

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.976
- I've got a question.

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:32.046
Why am I here at
4:30 in the morning?

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:33.915
Don't you guys pre-tape
this stuff sometime

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:37.051
during the afternoon
or something?

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.053
- And how long have you acted?

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:40.655
- Dude, I don't act.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:43.057
I'm actually a
pizza delivery boy.

01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:47.128
Now my true calling is
being a movie director.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:51.032
- Amazing, I'm sure
you'll be fantastic at it.

01:12:54.304 --> 01:12:58.206
- I'm going to be glad
to see this bunch gone.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:03.711
You know, I've been the station
manager here for 14 years,

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.013
and the last few years
seeing this group

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:10.184
tear up the studio like
that, it's been the worst,

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:14.222
especially how he treats you.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:15.356
- Who, Shawn?

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:20.461
He's just a tough guy
in front of others.

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:25.600
Sometimes I wonder if he
does appreciate me, you know.

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.970
- He doesn't understand
you like I do.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:31.973
- I write all the
scripts for the show.

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:35.643
Now I'm out here
and he's in there,

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.446
making a fucking
fool of himself.

01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:40.915
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:44.552
I think that-

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:45.787
- I just take them
all out and take over

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:49.490
the fucking show myself,
you know what I mean?

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:56.831
- I think things will
probably get better for you

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:59.600
once production on the
feature starts on Monday.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.602
- Monday?

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:02.804
Who told you that?

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:06.707
- I heard them talking about
it in between the movies.

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:09.777
What'd you think all that location
scouting you did was for?

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.045
- I don't know, but no
one actually told me

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:13.448
we were going to camera yet.

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:28.029
- Hey, why don't you stay
here at the station with me?

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:32.200
You could have your
own show and we could-

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:34.735
- Hey, brownie faces.

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.204
Guess who's favorite
hot little intern

01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:38.673
just got her first lead role?

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:42.543
It's me.

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:44.245
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.681
You got the lead part?

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.683
- Yeah.

01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:51.652
I mean, I haven't like
read the full script,

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:53.654
but I've skimmed it and
from what I can tell,

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.824
it's like, it's like
Grammy award winning.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.125
It's that good.

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:02.497
You know, Sam, I'm
always telling you

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:03.865
and I know that you're
a little bit older

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:06.934
and you don't really
understand this,

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:09.604
but it's all about
social networking

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:12.607
and branding yourself
and you know,

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:16.811
I'm not above texting
directors at 3 in the morning,

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:20.248
posting constant
selfies on Instagram,

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.517
Facebooking all the
time to let people

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:25.119
know how driven and
ambitious you are.

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:29.624
I mean it's a networking
job, it's 24/7.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:32.093
Anyway, is Dr. Nasty in here?

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:38.432
No, well, I'll leave
you guys alone.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.502
See you later.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:52.513
- Son of a bitch!

01:15:57.854 --> 01:16:01.589
- I'm cutting to
commercial in 5, 4, 3.

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:02.790
- If you think you're
leaving me on the sidelines

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:04.125
while you shoot
your feature, Shawn,

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:06.260
you've got another
fucking thing coming.

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:07.528
You know what?

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:08.462
I can only bite my
tongue for so long

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:09.964
before it starts bleeding.

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:11.566
What about all those script
edits I did for you, huh?

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:12.833
The location scouting.

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.836
I did everything
you asked me to do.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:17.939
- No, baby, I read those.

01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:20.841
This is my script, you know,
and I just didn't think

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:22.910
I could really use them.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.880
- Shawn, your script sucks.

01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:27.882
It's got nothing but zombies
and dead cheerleaders

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:29.784
and a found footage film.

01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:32.553
It's nothing but cliches.

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:36.157
- Well, you clearly don't know
what you're talking about.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.960
Why don't you stick to the jobs
that I tell you to do, huh?

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:40.494
- You're fucking this up.

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:43.464
- Do you know how
you got this job?

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.437
- What do you mean?

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:52.039
- You heard what I said.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.775
Do you know how
you got this job?

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.115
Fucked your way into
it, nothing more.

01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:04.452
- I'm going home.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:05.987
- Okay, princess, but you
did do some pre-production

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.221
work and you can throw
that shit on your resume

01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:08.456
if you think it's going to help,

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:09.457
but the bottom line
is if you go home,

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:11.192
you're out of a job.

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:14.028
- Is that a threat?

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:16.664
- No, it's a promise.

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:19.467
- I'm a solid actress and
a solid writer, Shawn.

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:21.502
I earned that part.

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:22.784
- Baby, I've seen
all your parts.

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:36.217
You know what?

01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:37.451
Fuck it.

01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:38.386
Get the fuck out of
here and you can move

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:39.854
out of my place, as well.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.122
I think that we're all
looking for a team player

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:42.323
around here and I
just don't quite think

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.892
you're pulling your weight.

01:17:44.894 --> 01:17:45.893
You're fired.

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:46.895
- What?

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:49.030
- And you know what?

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:50.531
Don't bother cleaning
out your office, either,

01:17:50.533 --> 01:17:52.533
because everything in
there, including the laptop,

01:17:52.535 --> 01:17:54.402
is property of this
production and I'm in charge,

01:17:54.404 --> 01:17:57.238
so I own it, just
like I own you.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:01.076
- Fuck you.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.548
- Shawn, I'm not sure if
this is like a bad time

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:10.451
or whatever, but
I was wondering if

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:11.952
we could go over the script.

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:15.089
- Absolutely, let's go this way.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:16.590
- You're so nice.

01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:52.674
- Samantha.

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:57.645
Help me Samantha, he's crazy.

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:00.481
- I did this for you.

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:01.949
This was all for you.

01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:02.951
For us.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:19.867
I'd admire this when I'd
watch you change for the show.

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:23.938
From the back curtain.

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:27.174
I got one.

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:29.743
So we could e together as one.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.074
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:01.308
Your own show.

01:23:04.914 --> 01:23:07.982
No more scheming ladder
climbers that you have

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:09.283
to worry about.

01:23:11.253 --> 01:23:14.154
No more drunken co-hosts
to have to tolerate.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.398
No more ass to kiss.

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:30.104
No more male
bullshit to swallow.

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:37.111
You've got your own show now.

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:42.383
Samantha, this is
your time to shine.

01:24:36.672 --> 01:24:39.573
We're going live
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:47.315
Action.

01:24:48.317 --> 01:24:51.151
- Welcome to the
Nurse Nasty show.
