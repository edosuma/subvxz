00:06.267 --> 00:08.700
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.733 --> 00:10.933
winter strikes
in the Alaskan bush.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.767
The storm is showing up.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.233
NARRATOR: Erik's got to make
opportunities count.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.433
ERIK: Ugh, fuck.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.200
My gun is frozen.

00:19.233 --> 00:21.733
The Hailstones race
to stock up for winter.

00:21.767 --> 00:24.000
CHIP: This really is
our last chance.

00:24.033 --> 00:26.067
Sue fights for winter fuel.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.433
SUE:
If they cannot make it back,

00:27.467 --> 00:29.300
I have to start
making decisions.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.367
NARRATOR:
And Andy and Kate are
trapped by the mighty Yukon.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.533
ANDY: This is just not
a safe thing to do.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.767
ANDY: The Yukon River
is our artery.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.333
It's our highway in the
wintertime with the dogs.

01:04.367 --> 01:08.433
It's really our only access
to the outside world.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.100
If we can't get
on the Yukon River,

01:10.133 --> 01:11.867
we can't get our supplies.

01:11.900 --> 01:15.033
The problem is the river's
not gonna freeze up

01:15.067 --> 01:18.167
in front of our camp
this year.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.700
This year we had an
unusual freeze-up.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.500
It was extremely low water.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.833
As the ice became more dense,

01:24.867 --> 01:28.200
it reached a pinch point
a mile upriver from here.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.267
That jammed the river shut,

01:30.300 --> 01:33.900
and it left open water
for about 70 miles downstream.

01:36.733 --> 01:38.800
Right now what's really
on my mind is

01:38.833 --> 01:40.800
how am I gonna get
from our camp

01:40.833 --> 01:43.567
to where the river
is completely frozen

01:43.600 --> 01:45.633
to where I can safely
run my dogs.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.833
Ugh, that don't look good.

01:58.533 --> 02:01.100
The problem with running along
the shoreline when it's like

02:01.133 --> 02:04.633
this is that this current's
really pretty strong,

02:04.667 --> 02:08.967
and if you go into this,
you can't pull yourself
back up on the ice.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
So, this is just not
a safe thing to do.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.467
NARRATOR: Unless Andy finds
a way across the river,

02:15.500 --> 02:16.767
he won't have access

02:16.800 --> 02:19.067
to the resources
and hunting grounds
he'll need

02:19.100 --> 02:21.133
to make it through winter.

02:21.167 --> 02:24.300
ANDY: The second option,
and one I've been thinking
about for a few years

02:24.333 --> 02:26.767
is to spend a couple of days,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.133
cut about a mile, mile
and half of trail through
the woods

02:30.167 --> 02:31.633
to another part of the Yukon

02:31.667 --> 02:33.600
where the river
is completely frozen.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.667
It's gonna be a
lot of hard work,

02:36.700 --> 02:39.600
but I don't mind putting
work in as long as

02:39.633 --> 02:42.200
I'm gonna have long term
benefits from that work.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.100
So, I've got about
a mile-and-a-half of trail

02:47.133 --> 02:48.367
I gotta cut

02:48.400 --> 02:52.367
through a fairly dense black
spruce and birch forest.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.467
I'm hoping I can do it
in two days,

02:54.500 --> 02:56.900
but days are short now.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.933
So, it's a real race
against time.

03:00.033 --> 03:01.267
(CHAINSAW STARTS)

03:10.267 --> 03:11.733
(CHAINSAW WHIRS)

03:23.633 --> 03:25.733
Some years
you work your ass off.

03:25.767 --> 03:29.767
Some years you just kind of
smooth right on through.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.200
Every year
is different up here.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.367
We just never know
from season to season.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.600
I think it's time
to stop for the day.

03:37.633 --> 03:39.100
I'm starting to lose my light,

03:39.133 --> 03:42.800
and uh, it's gonna take a lot
of work to cut through this.

03:42.833 --> 03:45.600
I'm probably about
a third of the way

03:45.633 --> 03:48.067
through this whole project.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.833
With the hardest
part yet to come.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.800
So, like a lot of things,

03:51.833 --> 03:53.800
it's good to go home,
get a good night's sleep,

03:53.833 --> 03:57.300
get a good meal,
and start fresh the next day.

04:00.767 --> 04:03.000
CHIP: You got caribou,
you got everything
you need to live.

04:03.033 --> 04:04.867
You don't really need
much else

04:04.900 --> 04:07.667
but you can't always
get caribou.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.100
Right now I'm going to the
Noorvik Aqqaluk High School

04:23.133 --> 04:24.633
to go pick up
my daughter Carolyn.

04:24.667 --> 04:28.733
She's coming with us
on this caribou hunt.

04:28.767 --> 04:30.700
Each year I always take
one of the girls.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.300
It's actually her turn.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.567
Of all the girls,
she's the one who hasn't

04:34.600 --> 04:37.200
shot a caribou
crossing the river yet.

04:37.233 --> 04:40.333
This ought to also be a good
learning trip for her.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.933
That way we can teach Carolyn
her traditional ways.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.400
(CHUCKLES)

04:48.433 --> 04:50.833
Yeah. This year you get
to shoot one.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.333
Am I squeezing
your hand too tightly?

04:53.367 --> 04:55.467
So excited to go. (LAUGHS)

05:00.933 --> 05:02.467
NARRATOR:
Learning to hunt is essential

05:02.500 --> 05:04.233
for surviving in the Arctic.

05:04.267 --> 05:06.000
It's a skill Agnes
is determined

05:06.033 --> 05:07.433
to pass onto her daughters.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.500
AGNES: There's caribou
crossing upriver,

05:10.533 --> 05:13.000
so we're heading
up there today

05:13.033 --> 05:15.767
and stock up for winter chow.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.167
CHIP:
Before the freeze-up comes

05:18.200 --> 05:20.133
and the animals
have to be hunted on land,

05:20.167 --> 05:22.167
we're gonna be hunting them
in the water in the river,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.667
where we can pick 'em out,
where we don't wound any,

05:24.700 --> 05:26.467
and we can see exactly
what we want

05:26.500 --> 05:29.000
and get exactly what we want.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.267
'Cause we're kinda behind,
way behind.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.467
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
only have a few short days

05:36.500 --> 05:37.767
to intercept caribou

05:37.800 --> 05:39.600
as they migrate
across the river.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.833
AGNES: See where
it's yielding?

05:41.867 --> 05:43.033
That's where we're going.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.167
We're almost there!

05:50.300 --> 05:51.967
Do I get to shoot a caribou?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.100
Yep.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.967
This spot is perfect spot

06:10.000 --> 06:14.267
because you can watch the
whole river down that way,

06:14.300 --> 06:15.533
and it's a long stretch,

06:15.567 --> 06:17.600
and you can watch the
whole river that way,

06:17.633 --> 06:21.300
and it's like,
it comes like this.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.400
So, you're kind of
right in the middle

06:23.433 --> 06:25.967
to where you could look
both directions.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.233
CHIP: This camp is a pretty
good place to be,

06:28.267 --> 06:29.767
and there's good trapping
in the winter,

06:29.800 --> 06:31.967
and it's a transition point
in the delta

06:32.000 --> 06:33.467
where the river meets the sea.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.667
People have been camping
here for thousands of years.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.600
My wife's dad,
he hunted this place

06:37.633 --> 06:39.100
almost all of his life
and my wife, too.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.067
She's hunted here
all her life,

06:41.100 --> 06:43.667
and the caribou
are still coming.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.167
(VOCALISING)

06:48.967 --> 06:51.100
You guys got the .22's loaded?

06:54.600 --> 06:55.933
(WHISPERS)
Good, you'll both need it.

07:00.933 --> 07:02.467
Did you bring the .22 shells?

07:07.267 --> 07:09.000
AGNES: Ready?

07:09.033 --> 07:11.600
-There's still some coming.
Oh, there's couple more bulls.
-CHIP: Shh.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.233
AGNES: Sit down, Carol.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.367
Sit down.
CHIP: Are you ready?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.033
AGNES: Yeah, they're coming
straight to us.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.867
CHIP: Okay. Here goes.
You guys ready?

07:18.900 --> 07:20.133
(MOTOR STARTS)

07:28.767 --> 07:30.300
AGNES: Carolyn, the big one!

07:31.033 --> 07:32.600
Yep, right in front of you.

07:33.633 --> 07:36.200
Right in front
of you, straight.

07:36.233 --> 07:38.733
You missed.
Carol, load up.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.367
Load up, Carol
before I shoot them all.

07:49.533 --> 07:51.767
Look with the gun, sweetheart.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.000
Only with the gun.

07:53.033 --> 07:54.033
CHIP: Shoot it, Carol.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.133
There you go.
Hey, there you go.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.767
No, that's not how you do it!

08:03.333 --> 08:04.567
AGNES: Yes!

08:04.600 --> 08:05.933
CAROL: Got it!

08:08.667 --> 08:10.433
CHIP: This is a humane
way to hunt.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.000
This is the best.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.833
You don't waste any.
You don't wound any.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.033
You shoot 'em in the back
of the head, and they
don't feel no pain.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.800
There's no waiting
for them to bleed out.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.967
So, that's how it goes.
We have to kill to eat.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.300
There's nothing
wrong with that.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.400
SUE: The life you live out
here, you better be in your
top game.

08:31.433 --> 08:34.067
Doesn't matter if you're just
going to the bathroom.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.800
If I get hit with a big-ass
storm and my panties are down,

08:37.833 --> 08:39.667
it's gonna be
very uncomfortable.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.433
Today I'm preparing for two
planeloads of fuel

08:51.467 --> 08:52.900
to be delivered.

08:52.933 --> 08:56.067
I need to get 4,000 gallons
to make it through my winter

08:56.100 --> 08:57.433
for heat and whatnot,

08:57.467 --> 09:01.167
but I've got horrible storms
coming, horrible conditions.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.367
I could have 60, 80 mile
an hour winds.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.233
Tons of snow at the backside,
and that's gonna

09:06.267 --> 09:08.333
cause a problem for me
to get my fuel in.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.567
If I don't get the fuel,

09:12.600 --> 09:16.433
if I can't keep myself warm
and alive, I can't be here.

09:20.133 --> 09:22.667
You still got 10, 12 miles
visibility to the east,

09:22.700 --> 09:24.567
but it does look like it's
degrading a little bit

09:24.600 --> 09:27.300
on that side
at about the five-mile point.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.500
PILOT: Okay.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.433
All righty. I do have
drums to be filled.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.367
Do you want that on
the first or the second?

09:33.267 --> 09:34.333
PILOT: How many you got?

09:34.367 --> 09:37.367
I have 1,200 gallons
to go in barrels.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.067
PILOT: Okay.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.267
Yeah. I don't want to take
up too much of your time
on the first loads,

09:41.300 --> 09:43.200
but I think if we do it
on the first load,

09:43.233 --> 09:44.300
that might be better.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.833
PILOT: Okay. We'll try.

09:46.867 --> 09:49.067
All right.
I'll see you when you get
down here, buddy. Thanks.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.300
PILOT: Okay.

09:51.533 --> 09:55.600
The C-46 can carry 2,000
gallons of fuel at a time.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.667
I am ordering 4,000.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.133
SUE: While the plane is here,

10:03.167 --> 10:05.267
and has the ability
with a high-power pump

10:05.300 --> 10:06.933
to put it in barrels
so I can move it,

10:06.967 --> 10:09.467
I wanna get as many
empty barrels ready.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.767
So I can fill those up

10:10.800 --> 10:12.467
and get them where they need
to live for the winter.

10:14.467 --> 10:15.800
NARRATOR:
In the depths of winter,

10:15.833 --> 10:18.533
even a short walk across camp
can be deadly.

10:20.033 --> 10:23.133
Getting the fuel into barrels
now will save Sue having

10:23.167 --> 10:25.667
to pump it in sub-zero
Arctic conditions.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.267
Why can't you just stay
put for me, you bitch?

10:31.300 --> 10:32.867
I've gotta get the fuel

10:32.900 --> 10:36.333
as close to where it's going
to be used as possible

10:36.367 --> 10:38.733
because I will not have
the help of the equipment
to do it.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.467
It's all hand pump.

10:46.933 --> 10:49.333
ERIK: I have a strong drive
to want to take on
those challenges

10:49.367 --> 10:52.133
associated with being out
in the natural environment.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.833
A lot of times I wonder
if I would've been better off

10:55.867 --> 10:58.400
if I was born, you know,
a couple hundred years ago.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.033
Without subsistence,
it would be too expensive

11:09.067 --> 11:10.333
to live way out here.

11:10.367 --> 11:13.500
Trapping and hunting
are integrally important

11:13.533 --> 11:15.567
to the lifestyle of living
out here in the bush.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.033
Just kind of glassing
this river valley here

11:22.067 --> 11:23.733
for predators,

11:23.767 --> 11:26.067
and I'm gonna set up
and do a little calling.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.967
There's fox, wolf,
wolverine, lynx.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.867
Any one of them might
come to the call.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.467
(MIMICS RABBIT CALL)

11:35.600 --> 11:38.833
This call I'm using
is a dying rabbit call.

11:38.867 --> 11:42.700
It imitates the noise that a
rabbit in distress makes,

11:42.733 --> 11:44.867
and it attracts all types
of predators.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.567
It's, uh, it's hard to be
patient out here in the
cold and sit still,

11:49.600 --> 11:51.567
but it's what you gotta do

11:51.600 --> 11:54.167
if you wanna
catch a furbearer.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.600
There's a wolf.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.200
It's way out there.
It's six, 700 yards.

12:07.233 --> 12:10.167
I don't think it's gonna
come any closer.
I'm gonna give it a go.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.100
I have a lot of respect
for wolves.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.700
They're unbelievably tough,

12:15.733 --> 12:18.333
unbelievably aware
of their environment.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.267
They're better hunters
than I'll ever be.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.500
NARRATOR: Earning money
in the wild is scarce at best,

12:24.533 --> 12:26.133
but the chance at a wolf

12:26.167 --> 12:29.400
could bring Erik
up to $1,500 for the hide.

12:29.433 --> 12:30.500
ERIK: It's hard shooting far

12:30.533 --> 12:32.367
when you're cold
and you're shaking.

12:34.033 --> 12:36.133
This is a real difficult shot.

12:36.167 --> 12:38.067
We'll see if I can
make it happen.

12:42.867 --> 12:44.067
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

12:48.733 --> 12:51.867
It was a real long shot,
but I gave it a go.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.300
Failed to make it happen.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.233
I guess that's why it's so
sweet when you do get a wolf

13:00.267 --> 13:02.000
just 'cause you know
how hard it is.

13:03.267 --> 13:06.567
I don't think I hit the wolf,
but I'm gonna go over there

13:06.600 --> 13:07.833
and follow its tracks
for a while,

13:07.867 --> 13:09.867
make sure there's no blood,
and make sure I'm not leaving

13:09.900 --> 13:11.300
a wounded animal behind.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.800
I followed up this wolf track

13:21.833 --> 13:23.667
about two-and-a-half
miles here.

13:24.967 --> 13:27.033
There's no sign of blood
or anything.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.633
Kind of bummed.

13:32.667 --> 13:37.467
Started off to a shit start
to my trapping season,

13:37.500 --> 13:40.200
and I only
have one fur so far, so...

13:41.933 --> 13:44.267
The trapping gods
have shined on me

13:44.300 --> 13:48.233
a couple great opportunities
here that I totally blundered.

13:48.267 --> 13:52.600
I think it's one for the wolf
and zero for Erik today.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.167
You know,
I'd like to make some money

13:55.200 --> 13:57.333
and get some fur
on the stretching board,

13:57.367 --> 13:59.300
but shit happens.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.033
CHIP: I want these kids
to go to school.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.533
I want these kids to work,

14:08.567 --> 14:09.767
but I think working
is more important

14:09.800 --> 14:11.333
than schooling
education myself,

14:11.367 --> 14:12.600
because as long as
you're willing to get up

14:12.633 --> 14:14.700
and get something done,
you're gonna do fine.

14:23.567 --> 14:25.300
I think this
is the one she shot.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.767
NARRATOR: Carol Hailstone
has just conquered

14:26.800 --> 14:28.667
an essential rite of passage

14:28.700 --> 14:33.000
as a subsistence hunter with
her first ever caribou kill.

14:33.033 --> 14:34.433
AGNES: You wanna tie
that one, Carol,

14:34.467 --> 14:35.900
since that's the one you shot?

14:35.933 --> 14:37.700
CHIP: Grab the horns
as we're passing.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.267
Right now, Carol. Get it.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.067
And face it up.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.400
Here you go, Carol.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.900
And try to put him
as tight as you could,

14:45.933 --> 14:47.367
so it won't drag.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.033
CHIP: So that's your
first big bull, bun?

14:52.733 --> 14:53.900
CAROL: What?

14:53.933 --> 14:55.133
That was your first big bull?

14:55.167 --> 14:56.433
Yeah.

14:56.467 --> 14:59.700
AGNES: Don't aim this way
towards anybody in the boat.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.400
CHIP: Can't turn around.
AGNES: Always forward.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.733
You have only this
area to shoot.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.200
You can't aim backwards.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.333
That's where
you'll always get scolded.

15:16.167 --> 15:18.433
AGNES: See right here
where you shot it?

15:18.467 --> 15:20.200
CHIP: Oh, in the antler.
AGNES: In the antler.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.667
CHIP: This is our last chance
of getting primo bulls.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.167
What they've done
is they've eaten,

15:27.200 --> 15:28.533
saved all their fat
for the rut,

15:28.567 --> 15:29.633
and then they quit eating,

15:29.667 --> 15:30.967
and they're gonna
burn all this fat.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.033
So, this really is our last
chance at something.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.367
It's our last chance
at fat bulls.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.867
So, if I get five,

15:37.900 --> 15:39.833
she gets five,
and she gets five,

15:39.867 --> 15:41.733
it'll be awesome.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.333
CHIP: Almost there.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.533
Up next to the other one.
Perfect, babe. Thank you.

15:46.567 --> 15:49.467
Well, we've got
six good caribou.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.733
That's a good start for today.

15:50.767 --> 15:53.533
We've got 500 caribou
running across the river.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.367
We're gonna eat about one

15:55.400 --> 15:57.533
every week or two
in our house.

15:57.567 --> 15:59.433
So this is gonna do us
good for part of winter,

15:59.467 --> 16:00.867
but winter up here is long,

16:00.900 --> 16:04.500
and there's no way I could
have enough food for winter.

16:04.533 --> 16:05.933
But this is a good start.
This is how we get through

16:05.967 --> 16:07.467
dark winter
till we can hunt again.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
SUE: The only thing you can
count on with the weather

16:13.433 --> 16:15.067
is the fact that you
can't count on it.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.633
You just gotta roll
with the punches.

16:35.933 --> 16:39.867
Getting the fuel is key for
me to be here in the winter.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.467
I have to have
it to stay warm.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.700
That's all there is to it.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.433
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens is racing
a winter storm

16:46.467 --> 16:48.800
to load in 4,000
gallons of fuel

16:48.833 --> 16:52.033
that has just flown 500 miles
from Fairbanks.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.700
So, looking at the weather,

16:55.733 --> 16:58.033
that's definitely coming down
kind of quick.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.200
Would you rather
get it in the bladder

17:01.233 --> 17:03.400
or I can just keep bringing
these barrels over?

17:03.433 --> 17:06.333
How important is it to you
to have those barrels full?

17:06.367 --> 17:07.500
Very important.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.867
We'd take the time
and put 'em in there

17:10.900 --> 17:12.667
if you'd rather have it there,

17:12.700 --> 17:15.067
but if this comes down we
won't be able to get back in.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.233
So, we'll put...

17:16.267 --> 17:17.333
Let's put it in there first.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.233
If we have the second load,
we'll get these.

17:19.267 --> 17:21.200
How's that sound?
Okay. We'll try.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.600
I'll try.
Okay.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.667
I originally wanted
my drums filled.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.467
Takes a little bit more time,

17:26.500 --> 17:30.067
so to save time and hopefully
get the other 2,000 gallons,

17:30.100 --> 17:31.500
I just said put it in
the bladder.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.833
Get going.

17:32.867 --> 17:35.100
The hose here where it's
connected to my bladder,

17:35.133 --> 17:37.033
I mean, you can see
there is ice all over.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.467
Not a good thing.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.600
So, I need to disconnect
the hose that I'm using

17:42.633 --> 17:46.733
so that the plane can connect
its hose for refuelling.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.133
I gotta find
the right connectors.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.600
I gotta get it all undone,

17:49.633 --> 17:52.900
and hopefully,
get two 2,000 gallon loads.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.567
JETHRO:
That's a two and something.
That ain't...

18:01.600 --> 18:02.900
TERRY: Two-and-a-quarter.

18:02.933 --> 18:04.100
JETHRO: Son of a gun.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.300
Let's see. We need...

18:08.000 --> 18:09.400
We need...

18:09.433 --> 18:11.333
Jethro, you wanna come over
here and see what I got?

18:11.367 --> 18:12.800
Yeah. Let me come over
see what you got.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.533
Wait, this is
looking promising.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.500
Hang on one second.
We may have something here.

18:16.533 --> 18:17.800
Let me get this.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.233
JETHRO: Is that right?
TERRY: No.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.067
-That ain't no better
than what we got.
-JETHRO: No, no, no.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.667
Hey, let me come over there
and see what you got, Sue.

18:25.700 --> 18:29.667
NARRATOR: Without the right
hose connectors, Sue can't
pump fuel from the plane.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.800
If she doesn't find it,

18:30.833 --> 18:34.067
she could lose $20,000
in delivery costs

18:34.100 --> 18:35.900
and run out of fuel.

18:36.733 --> 18:37.833
That ain't gonna work either.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.700
Yep.

18:39.733 --> 18:41.700
Did the piece that he
brought out not work?

18:42.900 --> 18:46.067
We're looking
for a double female.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.733
Well, we looked through
what I had in there.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.167
Let me see
what I got over here.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.600
JETHRO: I got
something right here.
TERRY: Hey, Sue. We found it.

18:51.633 --> 18:53.033
Okay.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.600
Jethro found something.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.867
SUE: Oh, thank God.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.600
Okay.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.500
SUE: Okay.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.600
TERRY: Okay. We're ready?

19:04.633 --> 19:06.267
Now open it back up.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.700
JETHRO: All right.
Let's see if we get it full.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.267
Closed, closed, closed.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.533
Awesome.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.633
If you think you can do
a second load,
and when you get out,

19:16.667 --> 19:18.900
if you think there's enough
time, it would help me out

19:18.933 --> 19:20.667
an awful lot to have
the barrels done.

19:20.700 --> 19:25.533
-Well, I'll try to.
-But just in case it's not
looking as good,

19:25.567 --> 19:27.533
then at least
I've got 2,000 going.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.133
TERRY: We'll just have to see.
SUE: Yeah.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.767
I can tell the difference
from the time we landed
to right now.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.233
Yeah. It's pretty quick.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.200
We'll get what we can.

19:36.233 --> 19:38.200
So, you guys are gonna pack
it all in

19:38.233 --> 19:39.400
like you're going away
for good?

19:40.967 --> 19:42.667
Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree.

19:47.200 --> 19:52.333
SUE: So, he's halfway done,
but the storm is showing up.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.967
Things are changing rapidly.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.833
Hopefully if the fog monster
stays on the south side

19:57.867 --> 19:59.867
of the river, we're all right.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.967
If he comes another
mile north,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.033
I don't get
the rest of my fuel.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.067
You know, you just gotta,
you gotta roll
with the punches.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.533
Hopefully, I'll get my
second load of fuel.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.467
If anybody can do it,
the old war birds can.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.433
I mean,
Terry is a hell of a pilot,

20:14.467 --> 20:16.400
but if they cannot
make it back,

20:16.433 --> 20:18.533
I have to start
making decisions.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.000
What do I cut down?

20:20.033 --> 20:22.700
What do I not have to have on?

20:22.733 --> 20:24.167
What can I risk?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.433
There's only one thing.
Shut down the gen.

20:26.467 --> 20:30.533
That means all my frozen food,
I may lose it.

20:30.567 --> 20:32.800
The closest grocery store
is 500 miles away.

20:39.867 --> 20:41.233
ANDY: If you live out here
long enough,

20:41.267 --> 20:42.700
shit's gonna happen to you,

20:42.733 --> 20:46.233
and you better know what
to do when that happens.

20:46.267 --> 20:49.200
'Cause when it gets cold
out in this country,

20:49.233 --> 20:51.233
you don't have a lot
of time to react.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.533
Well, day two
for trail cutting.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.433
The wind chill's almost
40 below zero,

21:10.467 --> 21:13.600
but I'm back in the woods,
and I'm up against the wall.

21:13.633 --> 21:17.133
It's a whole wall here of
really dense black spruce.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.867
I'm gonna have to cut
a hole through the wall,

21:19.900 --> 21:24.067
and hopefully, I'll be able to
connect up to the Yukon River

21:24.100 --> 21:26.800
in about another three
quarters of a mile or so.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.500
These temperatures are gonna
be really hard on the saw.

21:29.533 --> 21:30.667
(CHAINSAW STARTS)

21:43.833 --> 21:46.567
One of the problems
I have when it's a dense
forest like this

21:46.600 --> 21:50.533
is just getting all the
trees out of here.

21:50.567 --> 21:52.433
There's no place
to throw 'em on the ground,

21:52.467 --> 21:53.933
so you just gotta kind of
pick 'em up

21:53.967 --> 21:55.500
and throw 'em over the top.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.333
Kind of hoping Kate will
show up later on today

21:59.367 --> 22:01.000
to give me a hand
with some of this stuff.

22:01.033 --> 22:02.333
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

22:08.300 --> 22:12.600
Another thing you have to be
careful of is you can't lay
your saw down in the snow.

22:12.633 --> 22:15.100
Gotta keep that out of the
snow as much as you can.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.733
Otherwise it freezes up.

22:26.867 --> 22:30.167
Boy, this chain's
getting really dull.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.400
I'm working way harder than
I have to to cut this stuff.

22:33.433 --> 22:35.567
Cutting these trees is like
cutting through rocks.

22:37.267 --> 22:39.867
It's like anything the first
time you do something.

22:40.633 --> 22:42.333
It's always the hardest.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.167
Right now it feels like
it's futile

22:44.200 --> 22:46.000
in this wall of spruce trees,

22:46.033 --> 22:49.667
but when I break out
and when it's all over,

22:49.700 --> 22:51.433
I'm gonna sit back
with a cold beer

22:51.467 --> 22:53.067
and feel real good about this.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.367
I'll be able to use
it for multiple years.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.633
It looks like it's gonna
start opening up

22:59.667 --> 23:01.633
a little bit more
for me up ahead,

23:01.667 --> 23:03.167
and, so I should start making

23:03.200 --> 23:04.933
a little bit better time
with this,

23:04.967 --> 23:06.733
so that's good.

23:07.867 --> 23:09.367
I just gotta keep working.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.167
(CHAINSAW STARTS)

23:22.867 --> 23:24.467
That baby's frozen up now.

23:26.367 --> 23:28.300
I can't hardly even move it.

23:30.467 --> 23:31.800
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

23:36.233 --> 23:38.800
Fuck you!
God damn fucking saw!

23:39.833 --> 23:41.900
(SIGHS)

23:41.933 --> 23:45.633
I think what I need to do
now is build a fire,

23:46.567 --> 23:48.233
try and thaw this thing out,

23:48.267 --> 23:50.233
and hopefully I can get
back to work.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.467
Birch bark is probably
one of the best

23:53.500 --> 23:56.133
natural fire starters
there is out here.

23:57.667 --> 24:01.400
Even if this is wet,
this'll burn really quick.

24:01.433 --> 24:03.533
As you spend more
and more time out here,

24:03.567 --> 24:06.533
you begin to look at things
in a very different way.

24:07.867 --> 24:10.533
I look at trees, and what can
I use off of them?

24:10.567 --> 24:13.167
If you lay a couple
green logs down,

24:13.200 --> 24:15.867
you can keep a fire going
for quite a long time.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.267
Living out here is not
just how to do things.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.867
If you don't have the right
philosophy of life out here,

24:25.900 --> 24:27.567
it's a struggle.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.000
You have to want
to live this way.

24:37.900 --> 24:39.300
Oh, look at that.

24:39.933 --> 24:41.133
It's turning now.

24:41.167 --> 24:43.333
Yeah, I just got to keep it
out of the snow now

24:43.367 --> 24:46.833
while it's nice and warm
or it'll just ice up again.

24:46.867 --> 24:49.233
Stuff gets in there,
and it's all iced up,

24:49.267 --> 24:50.900
and it creates
a lot of friction,

24:51.867 --> 24:54.067
and all the oil that's
lubricating the bar

24:54.100 --> 24:55.767
gets iced up.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.200
Oh, that feels good.

24:59.233 --> 25:01.967
God only made one mistake
when he designed man,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.600
and that was he needed
to have bigger veins

25:04.633 --> 25:05.933
in the thumb.

25:07.933 --> 25:09.167
Hey, boys!

25:09.200 --> 25:10.533
Who you guys got?

25:10.567 --> 25:14.233
Hi, Jack, hi, Berg.
What are you guys doing here?

25:14.267 --> 25:15.500
Did you bring lunch?

25:16.667 --> 25:18.367
KATE: Looks like
you're working hard.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.600
Uh, chainsaw froze up.

25:20.633 --> 25:22.067
KATE: Oh, no.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.900
Oh, man, thanks for
bringing my parka.

25:23.933 --> 25:25.967
I get cold pretty quick
as soon as I stop.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.633
How's it all going?

25:28.667 --> 25:30.700
You know,
besides that trouble?

25:30.733 --> 25:34.200
Oh, it's slow.
It's really thick back there.

25:34.233 --> 25:37.400
It's gonna be a lot of work.
I still got quite a bit to do.

25:38.133 --> 25:39.800
KATE: Yeah.

25:39.833 --> 25:42.500
Well, do you want me to stick
around and help a little bit,
help stuff, or...

25:42.533 --> 25:44.100
That would be a huge help.

25:44.133 --> 25:46.267
Be careful, 'cause you know
how I get with a chainsaw.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.667
-Oh, I'm gonna give you
a wide berth, buddy.
-(LAUGHS)

25:50.200 --> 25:51.633
(CHAINSAW STARTS)

25:57.700 --> 26:01.467
Kate's out here with me,
throwing the cut stuff out.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.733
I'm making a lot more
progress with her here.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.933
If I'm lucky,
a few more hours.

26:08.967 --> 26:11.267
If I'm not,
another day or so of cutting.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.100
It's hard to say.

26:13.133 --> 26:15.533
I'm gonna be glad
when this trail's in,

26:15.567 --> 26:17.733
'cause I'll be able to use
this for a long time.

26:17.767 --> 26:20.667
So, even though this
is a lot of work,

26:20.700 --> 26:23.600
this is gonna be a big
payoff in the long run for us.

26:24.700 --> 26:26.100
I just gotta keep working.

26:26.633 --> 26:27.767
(CHAINSAW WHIRS)

26:30.300 --> 26:33.600
SUE: For me, the doctor is
500 miles each direction,

26:33.633 --> 26:35.467
several bush plains.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.833
There is nobody that's gonna
come help me.

26:38.867 --> 26:40.200
I better figure it out.

26:44.467 --> 26:46.833
I'm waiting on
my fuel, however,

26:46.867 --> 26:50.067
if a fuel drop happens and
they have a (COUGHS) cough,

26:50.100 --> 26:52.267
that can be life threatening
for me.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.767
You live in a sterile
environment,

26:53.800 --> 26:55.267
and you have no defences.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.367
So the smallest little bug
comes in,

26:57.400 --> 26:59.100
and I get knocked flat by it.

27:01.233 --> 27:03.533
I have not been feeling

27:03.567 --> 27:07.267
100% lately,

27:07.300 --> 27:10.367
so I have a way here
that I can take care of myself

27:10.400 --> 27:12.200
and kill some of the bacteria
or viruses

27:12.233 --> 27:13.633
that may be trying
to attack me.

27:13.667 --> 27:15.500
Bacteria cannot live
in the presence

27:15.533 --> 27:17.633
of silver or gold particles.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.700
There's a thing called
colloidal silver water

27:19.733 --> 27:21.000
that I want to make.

27:23.100 --> 27:27.333
And electrical charge is
going to allow

27:27.367 --> 27:29.833
molecules of this silver

27:29.867 --> 27:33.300
to come off of the strand
and become suspended

27:33.333 --> 27:35.467
so many parts
per billion in the water.

27:36.533 --> 27:38.733
I take just the tiniest
bit of sea salt.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.567
It's an electrolyte.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.633
It will help conduct
the current better.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.000
You do not need much.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.867
Ten, $15 worth of silver
is going to save me

27:55.133 --> 27:59.800
five, $10,000 in flights
and antibiotics

27:59.833 --> 28:02.700
if I want to fly
and see the doctor.

28:02.733 --> 28:07.033
I can't afford to be down
because I'm sick.

28:07.067 --> 28:09.367
It's arming myself
on the inside.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.600
I put guns all around camp
to keep me safe

28:11.633 --> 28:14.100
from the big creepy crawlies.

28:14.133 --> 28:16.567
I got to put little silver
bullets in my body

28:16.600 --> 28:19.000
to take care of the
tiny creepy crawlies.

28:19.033 --> 28:20.900
Bottoms up to my health.

28:30.133 --> 28:32.000
ERIK: There's certain people
that are born

28:32.033 --> 28:34.733
with a certain drive in them.

28:34.767 --> 28:36.500
You either have it
or you don't.

28:37.867 --> 28:39.667
And for me it's strong.

28:45.467 --> 28:48.600
You know, living way out
in the Arctic here

28:48.633 --> 28:51.500
in rural Alaska,
you need to be self-motivated.

28:51.533 --> 28:54.367
You know, the only person
to kick my butt out of bed
in the morning is myself,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.933
so I need to get up and
do what I need to do,

28:56.967 --> 28:58.867
and there's nobody
there to tell me to do it.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.667
Been working my way
along this river bluff here.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.167
There's a fresh fox
track moving along.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.767
I'm gonna get up
on the little bluff

29:07.800 --> 29:10.967
and see if I can't
call a fox in.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.733
NARRATOR: Erik missed his
chance yesterday

29:12.767 --> 29:14.967
at a $1,500 wolf pelt.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.167
Today he's hoping
to make up for the loss

29:17.200 --> 29:20.667
using the call of a rabbit in
distress to lure in predators.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.300
(MIMICS RABBIT CALL)

29:39.067 --> 29:40.067
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

29:45.100 --> 29:47.967
It's always nice when a plan
comes together.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.367
A lot of people misconstrue
people's desires

29:50.400 --> 29:52.567
to hunt as a bloodlust
or something like that.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.933
That's not what it is at all.

29:53.967 --> 29:55.967
I love animals
more than anything.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.267
I came here just because
I really had an appreciation

29:58.300 --> 30:00.267
for wilderness
and I was willing

30:00.300 --> 30:02.333
to sacrifice some
of the social interactions

30:02.367 --> 30:04.167
associated with living
in a town

30:04.200 --> 30:06.967
to have all these great
opportunities that I do.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.800
Nice red fox.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.667
Really nice fur.

30:17.867 --> 30:19.867
Really nice rich red colour.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.233
Nice fox.

30:31.267 --> 30:32.933
NARRATOR: With one fur
in hand,

30:32.967 --> 30:36.700
an unusual opportunity crosses
Erik's path,

30:36.733 --> 30:39.367
a unique and valuable
dark red fox.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.067
ERIK: This is a one
in a thousand type

30:41.100 --> 30:42.200
of colour fox.

30:42.233 --> 30:44.433
This is a really,
really incredible fox.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.367
They don't come much
better than that.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.267
(GUN COCKS)

30:52.433 --> 30:53.900
Oh, fuck that.

30:53.933 --> 30:55.300
My gun is frozen.

31:06.800 --> 31:07.867
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

31:07.900 --> 31:09.267
Let's roll.

31:27.867 --> 31:30.300
This is a red fox,
real dark one.

31:30.333 --> 31:34.067
It's got a little red left in
it, but totally black legs,

31:34.100 --> 31:36.200
totally black belly.

31:36.233 --> 31:39.567
It's got a fairly black tail
with a nice white tail tip.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.100
I couldn't be more enthralled.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.700
You know, even though
I'm kind of down on myself

31:43.733 --> 31:45.533
about missing that wolf...

31:45.567 --> 31:47.033
Okay,
that's an understatement.

31:47.067 --> 31:49.300
I'm really down on myself
about missing that wolf.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.700
I'll probably beat myself up
about that for,

31:51.733 --> 31:53.467
I don't know, 10, 15 years.

31:53.500 --> 31:58.733
But I was able
to call in two reds today.

31:58.767 --> 32:01.600
A red red and this
real dark cross.

32:01.633 --> 32:03.800
I wouldn't say that redeems
myself for the wolf,

32:03.833 --> 32:05.900
but we're at least headed
in the right direction.

32:08.133 --> 32:10.133
Beautiful male cross fox.

32:22.967 --> 32:26.367
The tradition of fur in Alaska
is as old as Alaska itself,

32:26.400 --> 32:28.400
and specifically foxes.

32:28.433 --> 32:31.467
The first white people in
Alaska were the Russians,

32:31.500 --> 32:33.167
and their business
was fox farming.

32:34.767 --> 32:36.500
Fur and Alaska are synonymous.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.333
You know, for me,
riding my snow machine

32:42.367 --> 32:44.200
a short distance,

32:44.233 --> 32:47.233
burning up maybe
a gallon of gas,

32:47.267 --> 32:49.333
couple of .22 shells,

32:49.367 --> 32:53.000
I have less than ten dollars
invested into this.

32:53.033 --> 32:56.067
This red here, bring $150-ish.

32:56.733 --> 32:58.300
And that cross fox there

32:58.333 --> 33:00.167
will bring at least
two-and-a-quarter,

33:00.200 --> 33:01.500
if not $250.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.467
Snapping off
the leg bone there

33:06.500 --> 33:08.967
to separate it with the hide.

33:15.933 --> 33:17.733
And down to the face.

33:17.767 --> 33:19.333
Work our way down to the eyes.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.333
When I was a little kid

33:22.367 --> 33:24.267
and I was learning
how to skin fox,

33:25.067 --> 33:26.600
I'd skin fox after fox

33:26.633 --> 33:28.367
and I'd always screw up
the eyes.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.500
Get in a rush, you can do
like I did there

33:30.533 --> 33:33.000
and cut the corner of the eye.

33:33.033 --> 33:36.433
It'll still be fine,
but as a perfectionist

33:36.467 --> 33:38.200
and being that
it's such a nice fox

33:38.233 --> 33:40.533
I hate that I did that.

33:40.567 --> 33:43.433
This is $400
or maybe a little bit better

33:43.467 --> 33:44.800
in fur here.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.900
And kinda ironic
when I think about it.

33:46.933 --> 33:51.267
When I was in my early teens
I'd sell fox for $10 apiece.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.833
This one fox is worth
more than I probably
would have made

33:53.867 --> 33:56.767
in the whole year when
I was 13, 14 years old.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.167
(LAUGHS)

33:58.200 --> 33:59.733
It's probably one of the
nicest foxes

33:59.767 --> 34:01.600
that I'm gonna
get the entire season.

34:01.633 --> 34:03.700
They don't come
much prettier than this.

34:07.733 --> 34:10.633
CHIP: I don't do things
that are uninteresting.

34:10.667 --> 34:13.233
I am the most interesting
hunter in the world.

34:13.267 --> 34:14.567
(LAUGHS)

34:21.900 --> 34:25.300
AGNES: We try our best to
teach our girls what we do,

34:25.333 --> 34:26.700
with all the fishing,

34:26.733 --> 34:29.567
and the wood gathering,
and the harvesting of meat.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.000
Hold it, hold it.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.400
CHIP: Come here, Carol.
Check this out.

34:36.533 --> 34:39.067
So I just cut the throat
right below the trachea.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.167
This is no different

34:40.200 --> 34:42.533
than what they do to cows
in factories.

34:42.567 --> 34:44.300
You know, the meat that people
eat down south

34:44.333 --> 34:45.967
is raised in pens.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.900
They're not free.
These animals are free.

34:48.933 --> 34:50.900
There's thousands of them,
that's a renewable resource.

34:50.933 --> 34:52.333
We don't take
too many of them.

34:53.733 --> 34:55.967
It is. It is much more
healthier for us,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.633
and that's why you need
to learn how to do this,

34:57.667 --> 34:59.567
so that you can be healthy,

34:59.600 --> 35:01.067
and then your kids
will be healthy.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.067
Yeah, me either.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.200
-You wanted me to show
you the kidneys, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

35:06.233 --> 35:07.967
Okay, so there's
the diaphragm,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.867
and that's the muscle
that makes all of that work.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.467
And that's a kidney.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.400
If it was 40 below zero,

35:14.433 --> 35:16.633
you could warm yourself up
by having a fresh slice.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.967
You can have
a slice of kidney.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.633
It'll warm you up.
It tastes like cucumbers.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.433
CAROL: Could we make heart
and tongue soup?

35:25.467 --> 35:28.533
Oh sure, good idea.
I already cut up the heart.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.633
Here, I'll show you how
to get the tongue out.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.433
Right there's the bone.

35:32.467 --> 35:33.633
See it?

35:33.667 --> 35:35.633
Put your knife
next to the bone,

35:35.667 --> 35:37.733
hook it in, slice forward,

35:37.767 --> 35:40.767
reach inside,
pull out the tongue.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.700
Go to the back of the tongue,
there's a bone,

35:43.900 --> 35:45.900
and cut up against the bone.

35:45.933 --> 35:47.000
Now I'm gonna go clean it up

35:47.033 --> 35:48.233
and we'll have that
for dinner.

35:49.833 --> 35:51.300
My older kids
have all done this.

35:51.333 --> 35:53.000
My older kids, I don't really
worry so much.

35:53.033 --> 35:55.200
But Carol,
Carol is at that age

35:55.233 --> 35:56.667
where she's really
curious about it.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.733
And Carol's on subsistence
leave right now.

35:58.767 --> 36:01.033
The school allows them
to follow their parents

36:01.067 --> 36:03.500
or uncles or brothers to go
do these kind of things.

36:04.767 --> 36:06.300
She's missing days of school,

36:06.333 --> 36:08.000
but she's not missing
an education.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.367
There's a lot of things in
this world that you have
to do for yourself,

36:10.400 --> 36:11.900
and if you want your kids to
learn properly

36:11.933 --> 36:13.367
what they
can't learn in school,

36:13.400 --> 36:14.800
you gotta teach it
to them yourself.

36:17.233 --> 36:19.467
Well, what matters is that
we got the food,

36:19.500 --> 36:22.033
and I don't have to pay
for it in the store.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.700
'Cause I can't afford it.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.533
Subsistence is basically
do it yourself.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.633
When you're subsistence
hunting, you're hunting
for yourself,

36:30.667 --> 36:33.267
for your own needs,
your own food,
your own materials.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.333
We work for ourselves.

36:34.367 --> 36:36.267
We don't have to work
for someone else.

36:36.300 --> 36:37.800
That's a bunch of garbage.

36:37.833 --> 36:40.633
We're a bunch of
work-for-ourselves
kind of people.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.800
We're much happier this way.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.967
It's the health of the chase.
It's the health of hunting.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.600
It's the health of staying
the night in the snow.

36:46.633 --> 36:48.333
It's the health of
what we're catching.

36:48.367 --> 36:50.700
And it's got a lot to do
with my wife's culture.

36:50.733 --> 36:52.233
And people give me a really
good time

36:52.267 --> 36:53.967
because I'm
a pretty good hunter.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.533
It's the one thing in life
I can do really well,

36:55.567 --> 36:57.267
so it's what I stick with.

37:05.567 --> 37:07.000
ANDY: Every day's a challenge.

37:07.033 --> 37:09.200
It's what Mother Nature
gives you.

37:10.233 --> 37:12.533
That's just living
out in the bush.

37:12.567 --> 37:14.167
So that's what I
gotta deal with.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.867
(CHAINSAW WHIRS)

37:26.800 --> 37:28.267
Day three of cutting.

37:28.300 --> 37:30.667
I've broken through
to the Yukon here.

37:30.700 --> 37:33.667
Unfortunately Mother Nature
keeps throwing me curve balls.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.433
'Cause now this wind is
blowing all the snow

37:35.467 --> 37:39.733
off my beach, and I'm down
to rock and sand,

37:39.767 --> 37:42.767
and really lousy conditions
for mushing.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.333
But at least I'm past
the point

37:45.367 --> 37:47.033
where it's deep open water.

37:47.067 --> 37:48.300
So from this point on,

37:48.333 --> 37:50.100
I should be able to make it
up to Eagle

37:50.133 --> 37:52.200
along the edge
of the Yukon River ice.

37:52.233 --> 37:54.533
I think I'll head back to the
house, go get the dogs,

37:54.567 --> 37:56.967
run my trail, and see
what I'm up against.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.233
NARRATOR: After cutting
through the forest to bypass

38:05.267 --> 38:07.000
the unfrozen river,

38:07.033 --> 38:11.300
it's do or die for Andy as
he tests his new trail.

38:11.333 --> 38:13.067
Iceberg, let's go
down this trail.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.467
New trail, buddy.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.400
New trail today,
and you got to listen
to me real good,

38:18.433 --> 38:21.267
because it's too rough
for me to hold on with you
going full speed.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.900
Okay?

38:22.933 --> 38:24.433
It's gonna be a rough
going, huh?

38:24.467 --> 38:26.533
You know, the first part
of the trail's pretty good,

38:26.567 --> 38:28.733
and then I get into
all the tussocks.

38:28.767 --> 38:31.200
And then cutting through that
slough and down on the river,

38:31.233 --> 38:32.667
it's pretty rough.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.000
I have to go out,
use this trail.

38:34.033 --> 38:35.900
That's the only way we're
gonna get upriver now.

38:35.933 --> 38:37.200
All right, well, good luck.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.733
ANDY: Up, up.

38:38.767 --> 38:39.967
Straight ahead.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.167
I think that's gonna
be a wild ride.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.967
Straight ahead. Haw haw.
Haw haw.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.033
Good. All right!

38:49.800 --> 38:52.333
Easy, easy, easy.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.667
Easy. Whoa.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.767
It's a white-knuckle trail
right now

38:57.800 --> 39:00.233
and it can only
get better with time,

39:00.267 --> 39:01.733
but it's the best I can do

39:01.767 --> 39:04.200
with the conditions
that we have.

39:04.233 --> 39:06.100
It bypasses the only part
on the river

39:06.133 --> 39:08.067
that I can't run
with the dogs.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.767
And so I feel good now.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.400
I've linked up to some other
trails and good parts
of the Yukon River.

39:13.433 --> 39:18.167
I don't feel as landlocked
in right now as I did before.

39:18.200 --> 39:22.333
Boil it all down,
it's a couple of days of real
hard labour and cold,

39:22.367 --> 39:25.900
windy temperatures,
but the effort's paying off.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.100
The world's opening up,

39:28.133 --> 39:30.567
and this was a good long-term
investment for me and Kate.

39:34.400 --> 39:39.400
SUE: It is the isolation
that I find paradise.

39:39.433 --> 39:41.667
Not because I dislike people.

39:41.700 --> 39:44.133
I'm not running away
from anything.

39:44.167 --> 39:46.367
I am just living my own life.

39:51.067 --> 39:52.600
Not even a half a mile to
the south,

39:52.633 --> 39:54.167
fogged down
to the ground.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.867
That is the leading edge
of this storm.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.033
Mother Nature gave me a little
break in the weather,

40:00.067 --> 40:02.100
but the next iron fist
is coming in.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.467
I need to get this fuel in
now before it gets any worse.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.933
I don't wanna risk those
pilots' lives by having them

40:09.967 --> 40:12.333
fly in these horrible,
dangerous winter conditions.

40:12.367 --> 40:14.567
I wanna get it done early
so I can relax.

40:15.367 --> 40:17.167
Here's to a good
safe delivery.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.733
100% of my order,
that's what I want.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.800
Some chicks want
chocolate and roses.

40:26.833 --> 40:28.833
Me, fuel.

40:39.933 --> 40:41.300
I have 20 barrels.

40:41.333 --> 40:43.500
I've got you 2,000 gallons.

40:43.533 --> 40:44.867
Yeah, and then I just
figured the rest

40:44.900 --> 40:46.133
we'll puke into there.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.200
Okay.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.733
SUE: I am really glad that the
weather stayed

40:51.767 --> 40:54.167
at bay long enough to
get the second drop in.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.867
They have enough time to help
me get it into barrels.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.033
I don't have enough barrels

40:58.067 --> 40:59.667
set up for the whole
winter yet.

40:59.700 --> 41:03.533
But it's a darn good start.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.433
It doesn't wanna
lift the load.

41:25.467 --> 41:27.233
(MOTOR REVS)

41:27.267 --> 41:29.200
TERRY: Okay.
SUE: All right.

41:29.233 --> 41:30.667
Thank you.
Thank you, Sue.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.400
I appreciate it.
Oh, thank you,

41:32.433 --> 41:34.300
and hopefully
I'll just see you

41:34.333 --> 41:36.300
between the
end of May and June.

41:36.333 --> 41:37.833
All right, you fly safe.

41:37.867 --> 41:39.233
I'm not getting any more fuel

41:39.267 --> 41:42.433
till more than halfway
through 2014.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.033
So, yeah, I mean, this is it.

41:45.067 --> 41:47.433
That was my social contact

41:47.467 --> 41:48.800
for the next eight,
nine months.

41:49.433 --> 41:50.933
(AEROPLANE DRONES)

41:51.500 --> 41:52.900
Be safe.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.467
Thank you, guys.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.833
I'm all emotional now.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.067
I don't get emotional.
I'm Super Sue.

42:17.500 --> 42:21.733
Like I've said before,
when that last person leaves

42:21.767 --> 42:24.700
is about the only time
that I can really say

42:24.733 --> 42:29.033
I have that momentary twinge
or twang if you will...

42:30.967 --> 42:33.000
...of emotional loneliness,

42:33.033 --> 42:34.867
where it's like, "Oh, man."

42:36.000 --> 42:37.567
"That's it."

42:37.600 --> 42:40.100
I do feel that, er,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.333
emotional angst.

42:43.367 --> 42:47.633
And then it's like,
"That was my last person!

42:47.933 --> 42:49.067
"Yee!

42:49.100 --> 42:51.067
"And now I can get
on with my stuff."

42:51.100 --> 42:54.200
So it's,
for a split personality,

42:54.233 --> 42:55.933
it's, you know,
quite the experience.
