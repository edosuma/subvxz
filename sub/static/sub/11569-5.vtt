00:06.609 --> 00:08.536
No! No!!

00:13.379 --> 00:16.379
Come on. Come on. Come on!

00:20.720 --> 00:23.637
Um, stealing cars is illegal.

00:23.639 --> 00:25.923
Guess I'll have to put you in jail.

Fish?

00:48.536 --> 00:51.699
And then I said,
"Stealing cars is illegal."

00:51.701 --> 00:54.335
And he looked real scared of me.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.455
Here you go, Mr. BoJenkins.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.191
Looks good. Real good.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.010
Hey, I'm just about to... get off.

01:04.013 --> 01:06.730
Maybe I can help you with that.

01:06.732 --> 01:09.633
What do you say we go for a... ride?

01:10.670 --> 01:11.852
You're bad.

01:11.854 --> 01:12.636
Huh?

01:12.638 --> 01:14.472
Salutations, stranger.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.357
You must be new around here.

01:16.359 --> 01:17.775
New here, huh? Huh?

01:17.777 --> 01:20.027
Well, Mr. BoJenkins is
the coolest guy in town.

01:20.029 --> 01:21.479
All the ladies love him.

01:21.481 --> 01:22.863
- Oh, Sheriff...
- He smells good, too.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.231
Sheriff. What are you doing?

01:24.233 --> 01:27.184
I'm getting her interested in you.

01:27.186 --> 01:28.486
Oh, I'm interested.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.820
Right.

01:29.822 --> 01:32.356
- Tell me everything about you.
- Huh?

01:32.358 --> 01:34.558
Uh... I'm the sheriff.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.627
Oh, that is so hot!

01:36.629 --> 01:38.629
Is it hot in here?

01:38.631 --> 01:40.664
Very hot in here.

01:40.666 --> 01:42.133
- Sheriff!
- What?

01:42.135 --> 01:43.601
She was trying to go for your key...

01:43.603 --> 01:44.835
Uh, what do you say we go somewhere

01:44.837 --> 01:46.470
a little more private?

01:46.472 --> 01:48.639
That sounds like a swell idea.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.841
Hmm. Something ain't right here.

01:50.843 --> 01:53.260
All right. I'm ready for that ride.

01:53.262 --> 01:55.262
Keep it percolatin' a little while,
baby.

01:55.264 --> 01:57.648
- Shweeeee!
- I got to go see my friend Blade,

01:57.650 --> 02:01.352
get some intel on this sneaky-deaky.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.320
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

02:03.322 --> 02:05.239
Hyah!

02:08.828 --> 02:11.996
Afternoon. I'm looking for Blade.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.797
Lewis!

02:13.799 --> 02:16.167
I told you,
Grandma, to call me Blade.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.168
Fish?

02:17.170 --> 02:18.419
Uh... no, thanks.

02:18.421 --> 02:22.373
So, here to get your ass
kicked in chess, BoJenkins?

02:23.376 --> 02:24.608
Not today, Blade.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.810
I need some intel on a shady lady.

02:26.812 --> 02:30.047
Follow me into my
intelligence command center.

02:30.850 --> 02:31.849
- Fish?
- No, thanks.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.350
Move it, cat.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.771
First,
I'll need a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

02:37.773 --> 02:39.223
description.

02:39.225 --> 02:42.226
Well, she's brunet with a
tattoo of a rose on her chest,

02:42.228 --> 02:44.728
about 5'9", 32 double-D.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.948
One breast's about 1.2 grams
heavier than the other.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.783
- Lisa Gabagoolie.
- Huh.

02:49.785 --> 02:53.070
Daughter of missing mafia
boss Jon Gabagoolie,

02:53.072 --> 02:56.323
who resurfaced this morning
in the Old Town jail.

02:56.325 --> 02:59.443
So she's using Sheriff to
break her daddy out of jail.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.961
I got to go warn him!

03:00.963 --> 03:01.879
Fish?

03:01.881 --> 03:03.247
Cat...

03:03.249 --> 03:08.719
get away from my
fi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-sh.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.688
Well, this is my home.

03:10.690 --> 03:15.092
We can have some marshmallows,
chips, raw hot dogs, and jelly.

03:15.094 --> 03:18.128
Or we could go upstairs.

03:18.130 --> 03:19.129
What for?

03:22.335 --> 03:24.001
Ohhhhh!

03:24.003 --> 03:26.904
So you want to eat hot dogs in bed?

03:26.906 --> 03:27.771
Huh?

03:27.773 --> 03:30.441
Sheriff? You have a guest?

03:30.443 --> 03:31.525
Hi, Mama.

03:31.527 --> 03:33.277
Hi. I'm Sheriff's girlfriend.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.478
Girlfriend?!

03:34.480 --> 03:36.981
What do you say we go
somewhere we can have...

03:36.983 --> 03:38.782
sex?

03:40.002 --> 03:41.168
- Bye, Mama.
- Whoa!

03:41.170 --> 03:43.454
Shweeeee!

03:43.456 --> 03:44.788
Hmm!

03:44.790 --> 03:46.874
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hey, Mr. B.

03:46.876 --> 03:50.594
My twin sister thought we
should make this a threesome.

03:50.596 --> 03:53.130
All rig...

03:53.132 --> 03:56.717
Ladies, uh,
hold on just a little bit longer.

03:56.719 --> 03:57.718
Hyah! Hyah!

03:57.720 --> 03:59.103
Hmph!

03:59.105 --> 04:00.938
- Stop, Sheriff!
- What?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.873
- She's only using you.
- What?

04:02.875 --> 04:04.642
- He's just jealous.
- What?

04:04.644 --> 04:05.843
Shut up, bitch!

04:05.845 --> 04:07.411
Hey, don't tell my bitch to shut up!

04:07.413 --> 04:09.480
She's only using you to
break her daddy out of jail.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.081
Assault! Arrest him, Sheriff!

04:11.083 --> 04:14.018
No, no. I'm serious.
Back off of my girlfriend.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.619
- Damn it! Listen to me!
- No!

04:15.621 --> 04:18.221
You made me do this!

04:21.944 --> 04:22.993
Sheriff, listen to me!

04:22.995 --> 04:24.361
Yeah, yeah. In you go.

04:24.363 --> 04:25.362
Just be for tonight.

04:25.364 --> 04:26.730
Hi!

04:26.732 --> 04:28.632
Sheriff, don't you lock me in this cell!

04:28.634 --> 04:29.934
I'll be right back.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.369
Just got to finish up some paperwork.

04:32.371 --> 04:34.788
- Daddy!
- What's taking so long with the keys?

04:34.790 --> 04:35.873
Jon Gabagoolie.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.575
What are they talking about?

04:37.577 --> 04:39.577
I saw a talking deer once!

04:39.579 --> 04:40.661
Yeah, yeah.

04:40.663 --> 04:42.513
Daddy, where have you been?

04:42.515 --> 04:44.298
Last year, we finally found out

04:44.300 --> 04:47.051
the whereabouts of that
rat Vito Pizzareli.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.336
Turns out the Witness Protection Program

04:49.338 --> 04:53.090
had turned him into a Bigfoot
and set him free in Old Town.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.558
But by the time we got here,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.594
he had befriended some kid and his dog.

04:56.596 --> 05:00.764
Then that dog killed all the
other bosses with machine guns.

05:00.766 --> 05:04.368
Then he made me a prisoner
down under his dog house.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.153
- Then...
- Stop!

05:06.155 --> 05:07.771
Have you started drinking again?

05:07.773 --> 05:09.440
Bye-bye.

05:09.442 --> 05:12.276
Whew!
All done with that paperwork.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.911
Shall we?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.280
Sheriff, get me out of here!

05:16.282 --> 05:17.665
Wish me luck.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.316
Ohh!

05:19.318 --> 05:20.417
Whiskey?

05:20.419 --> 05:21.869
Thanks. I could use one.

05:21.871 --> 05:23.504
What? Pass me a drink.

05:23.506 --> 05:24.822
Okay. No!

05:24.824 --> 05:26.957
- Don't give this scumbag any!
- What?!

05:26.959 --> 05:30.544
I could have you taken care of
for disrespecting me that way.

05:30.546 --> 05:33.180
Where I come from,
you would get a special delivery.

05:33.182 --> 05:35.966
That is where we chop your
face off down to the chin

05:35.968 --> 05:37.635
so it falls open like a mailbox.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.804
Then we stick a gun in your
mouth and send you a message.

05:40.806 --> 05:42.189
Well, where I'm from,

05:42.191 --> 05:44.692
there's something
called a flip-and-smash.

05:44.694 --> 05:46.143
Oh, yeah? What's that?

05:46.145 --> 05:49.413
That's where the sheriff
has sex with your daughter.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.365
Oh, yeah!

05:52.818 --> 05:55.035
Yay! We're gonna have sex!

05:55.037 --> 05:57.071
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay! Calm down!

05:57.073 --> 06:00.541
Wait a minute.
What if you were using me?

06:00.543 --> 06:05.496
You better prove you're
not by giving me a... kiss?

06:05.498 --> 06:07.915
O...kay.

06:07.917 --> 06:09.667
One kiss.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.336
I'm in love!

06:12.338 --> 06:14.705
Oh. Oh, okay. All right, all right!
That's enough!

06:14.707 --> 06:15.839
Num!

06:15.841 --> 06:17.708
Ah! Look! A bed!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.059
And a lamp!

06:19.061 --> 06:21.712
Ohh! And a bubble-top tub!

06:21.714 --> 06:25.349
Now, give me those clothes,
and I'll be right behind you.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.217
Okay. Uh...

06:27.219 --> 06:29.705
You... want me to take your clothes off?

06:29.810 --> 06:30.958
Uh-huh.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.925
Sweet! Yay!

06:34.927 --> 06:37.428
It's so sexy in here.

06:37.430 --> 06:40.798
I can't wait to rub
our underwear parts together.

06:41.784 --> 06:43.267
I got 'em, Daddy!

06:43.269 --> 06:46.036
- Hey, what's that on your face?
- Uh, it's nothing.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.038
Huh?

06:49.075 --> 06:52.343
Looks like Sheriff gave
her the old flip-and-smash.

06:53.679 --> 06:54.745
What?

06:54.747 --> 06:55.913
Classic Sheriff.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.214
Oh!

06:57.216 --> 06:59.950
That's it! I'm gonna kill that sheriff!

06:59.952 --> 07:01.518
- What? Daddy, no!
- Huh?

07:01.520 --> 07:03.153
- Uh-oh.
- Oh!

07:03.155 --> 07:04.655
Daddy, we have to go!

07:04.657 --> 07:06.106
Wait. Give me your gun.

07:06.108 --> 07:07.274
What? Why?

07:07.276 --> 07:09.443
I'm gonna kill that dog first.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.196
There you are, Mr. Pickles! Mnh?

07:12.198 --> 07:14.948
Look what I did with the free
hair from the barbershop!

07:14.950 --> 07:16.233
Mnh?

07:18.738 --> 07:20.621
Damn! I think I just got Sheriff killed.

07:20.623 --> 07:21.705
Oh, well.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.907
But I'm strong. Real strong!

07:23.909 --> 07:26.043
- I'm powerful!
- So much power!

07:26.045 --> 07:28.996
These bars ain't nothing!

07:28.998 --> 07:32.082
You're... You're...
You're bending the bars!

07:32.084 --> 07:33.050
Ohh!

07:33.052 --> 07:35.169
New plan.

07:35.171 --> 07:36.954
Hey! Emergency lube.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.672
I'll squeeze through the bars.

07:41.427 --> 07:42.693
Ohh!

07:42.695 --> 07:45.796
I guess Sheriff is a dead man.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.131
Fish?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.198
Blade?!

07:48.200 --> 07:51.135
I saw you on the security-y-y-y-y-y-y...

07:51.137 --> 07:51.935
Huh?

07:51.937 --> 07:53.637
Y-y-y-y-y camera.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.738
Fish?

07:54.740 --> 07:56.573
- No, thanks.
- Hi, elephant!

07:56.575 --> 07:57.658
Get off of me, man!

07:57.660 --> 07:58.776
Hi.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.194
- There you are!
- Huh?

08:00.196 --> 08:03.247
My other twins thought we
should make this a fivesome.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.332
- Oh, I'll be right back!
- Huh?

08:05.334 --> 08:06.550
Fish?

08:06.552 --> 08:08.786
- Daddy, wait!
- I'm gonna kill that damn sheriff!

08:08.788 --> 08:09.953
Daddy, please!

08:09.955 --> 08:12.206
Is that you, girlfriend?

08:12.208 --> 08:16.093
I can't hear very well
over the sensual music.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.528
- Girlfriend?!
- Daddy, stop!

08:17.530 --> 08:19.062
So you do have feelings for him.

08:19.064 --> 08:22.366
No! We should just be careful,
keep things quiet.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.234
Aha!

08:24.236 --> 08:26.303
Huh?

08:27.807 --> 08:28.806
Fish?

08:28.808 --> 08:29.807
- Huh?
- Huh?

08:29.809 --> 08:31.208
- Blam!

08:33.813 --> 08:35.979

- Unh! Ohh!

08:35.981 --> 08:37.748
There you are, girlfriend.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.150
That's okay. True love waits.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.818
Ohh!

08:41.821 --> 08:43.236

There, there, Sheriff.
