WEBVTT

01:26.628 --> 01:28.546
Kitchen?
Clear.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.423
Boiler room?
Clear.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.259
Laundry?
Clear.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.553
Clear.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.554
Rec room?

01:37.889 --> 01:40.892
Who checked rec room?
-It was supposed to be Hellman.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.270
I have rec yard, dumbass,
so you fucked up.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.565
No, I didn't. I wrote it down.
So, you fucked up.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.569
Whoa. Not about who fucked up.
Our priority is finding Ms. Morello.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.197
During a prison break,
our priority is securing the perimeter.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.949
If one inmate gets out, others can, too.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.159
-We should assume she's armed.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.037
-Let's not catastrophize.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.332
We will finish
the rest of the sweep in pairs.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.544
Alvarez, Hopper, check the rec room.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.796
<i>Found her. I need backup.</i>
<i>I'm in the chicken coop. Hurry.</i>

02:09.879 --> 02:12.382
Change of plans. You, you with me.
You guys stay here.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.309
I see a bulge. I think she's armed.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.772
Ms. Morello

02:32.360 --> 02:33.361
Lower your weapon.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.949
Ms. Morello, we're entering
the chicken coop now.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.953
One, two...

02:42.036 --> 02:43.246
Go, go, go!  Stop, inmate!
-Wait!

02:48.459 --> 02:49.794
-Oh, shit.
-We got her.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.715
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Is

02:53.798 --> 02:55.133
You did not have to do that.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.595
-Hellman.
Yeah?

02:58.678 --> 03:00.346
Pick her up, get her to medical.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.185
Hey, hey. It's okay. There was a bulge.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.520
Gently. Okay.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.148
There's your bulge.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.733
Oh.

03:12.734 --> 03:13.651
Wow.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.653
Really smells like fried chicken.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.755
Lockdown is now over.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.800
Please resume regular activities,
and do not try to escape like an idiot.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.807
All right, ladies.
Come on out, if you want.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.142
What, are you gonna puke?

03:46.559 --> 03:51.064
Don't puke. We gotta do this
post-lockdown checklist bullshit.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.525
I need a minute.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.321
Dude, do you know they can smell fear?

04:02.450 --> 04:07.121
"All inmates have been offered a chance
to shower after the lockdown."

04:07.455 --> 04:08.623
Yeah, check.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.750
But we didn't do that.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.214
Go get a grip, okay? Seriously, go.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.051
Come on.
I can handle a room full of cunts.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.888
Get up. There you go.

04:25.181 --> 04:30.228
Jesus. Have some water,
maybe wash your face. You look like shit.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.312
Woof.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.065
What the fuck you lookin' at, inmate?

04:39.028 --> 04:41.114
Sylvie, will you wait?

04:41.197 --> 04:45.285
Don't come to the bar if you're gonna
embarrass me in front of my friends.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.704
-You did that all on your own.
-Don't.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.831
Will you stop? You're being ridiculous.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.959
No, you're being ridiculous.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.258
God. This shit would not happen
if you weren't wasted.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.926
-We don't always have to

05:02.010 --> 05:03.136
close down the bar, you know?

05:03.219 --> 05:06.472
I wanted to leave an hour ago
and you ignored me, like last weekend.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.683
You could've left.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.600
Yeah.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.811
So you could end up
in a doorway somewhere?

05:15.982 --> 05:19.235
I'm gonna go see
if I can borrow that guy's thingie.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.285
What the hell are you doing?
Oh, my God!

05:27.368 --> 05:30.538
-Fuck. Sylvie, get out of there.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.373
I'm not fucking around. Come on.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.502
-Fuck.

05:44.719 --> 05:45.595
Oh, shit.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.765
Yes, yes, we're okay. We're good.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.727
I'm sorry.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.148
-I'm sorry.
-Shh.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.610
-It's all good. I got you.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.613
I got you.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.752
Red, you wanted to prep the potatoes
for tomorrow, remember?

06:18.169 --> 06:19.253
I did?

06:19.879 --> 06:23.383
-Yeah. Come on.
-Oh, that's right.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.013
Watch her.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.016
Okay. I mean,
I was gonna wash these dishes,

06:32.100 --> 06:35.895
but I think that's the detention center
version of a sock on the doorknob.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.567
Dinner's not until 6:00.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.539
What? No food between meals.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.170
What is she saying?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.506
She's not speaking Spanish.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.800
Maybe she wants to volunteer?

07:07.427 --> 07:11.055
Uh, well, we are short one.
I got plenty for her to do.

07:11.514 --> 07:15.101
Fine.
But teach her some English, will you?

07:25.027 --> 07:28.948
Okay. Just relax. Close your eyes.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.741
-Take a deep breath.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.079
All right, I'm gonna go so slow
and be so gentle, okay?

07:47.675 --> 07:48.509
Okay.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.106
-Whoa, whoa. That wasn't even--
-I know, but it hurt.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.318
Sometimes, it even hurts when I pee.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.112
-I don't think this is going to work.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.364
I don't wanna hurt you.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.284
It felt good until...

08:13.993 --> 08:14.827
Okay.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.289
Okay, great. Uh...

08:19.373 --> 08:21.250
You're not gonna hurt my feelings.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.878
We're just workin' out
the mechanics, all right?

08:23.961 --> 08:25.630
So, you gotta tell me everything.

08:26.088 --> 08:29.467
I mean, this isn't about me proving
that I'm fucking great at sex.

08:29.550 --> 08:33.429
This is about you feeling amazing, yeah?

09:02.208 --> 09:03.292
What are you doing?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.517
Parsley

09:23.312 --> 09:24.313
Hmm?

09:25.773 --> 09:27.149
Okay. Um, right here.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.158
Hey, Red, you ever heard of a country
that does parsley soup?

09:37.785 --> 09:38.911
Oh, my God! Red!

09:38.995 --> 09:40.496
-I need help in the kitchen.
<i> Copy that.</i>

09:42.248 --> 09:43.291
Move away from the knife.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.502
Nobody's touching any goddamn knives.
We need to get her to medical now.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.461
Red, what happened?

09:47.545 --> 09:48.796
-I told you to watch her.
-I'm sorry.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.340
-I don't need anyone watching me.
-She's bleeding.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.175
Yeah, let's go.

09:59.015 --> 09:59.849
Let go.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.101
-You need to hold the pressure.
-Leave me alone, Nicky.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.185
She needs to see a doctor.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.855
She cut her finger.
I think I can handle stitches.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.690
Great, but it's not just the finger.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.233
She's been having trouble
remembering things

10:09.317 --> 10:10.985
-and there have been mood swings.
-Don't listen to her.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.695
She's doesn't know
what she's talking about.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.988
-Come on, Red.
-Okay.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.073
Right now, let's just see
about this hand, okay?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.785
Hey, I'll take you back to the block.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.039
Hold on. What happened to Morello?

10:23.414 --> 10:26.917
Well, after they found her, I think
she was sedated for her own safety.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.004
Come on. Let's go.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.180
No.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.306
Hmm.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.684
At my office,
we only have posters of Manhattan.  Never gets old.
Neither does the free lunch.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.524
-Surprise me.

10:51.025 --> 10:55.071
I am so glad you finally
got to come see where I work.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.283
Yeah. Now that the big prison secret
is out at Chapman Accounting,

10:59.367 --> 11:01.327
my dad has relaxed a little bit.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.288
He said he doesn't mind me
setting my own hours

11:04.372 --> 11:05.623
as long as I get all my work done.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.584
See? You ripped off the Band-Aid

11:08.668 --> 11:12.129
-and a beautiful scab began to form.
Yeah.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.756
Does this mean
you can come to yoga

11:13.839 --> 11:16.133
with me during the week, not just Sundays?

11:16.217 --> 11:17.635
Maybe, but I'm warning you,

11:17.718 --> 11:20.763
a good hip-opener class
will definitely make me cry.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.139
I can handle that.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.683
Come, sit.

11:26.852 --> 11:32.191
These swings remind me of the ones
they had at the lounge in Barneys.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.568
You used to work at Barneys?
Were you a buyer?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.278
They bought from me.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.366
I had an artisanal soap company
for a hot second.

11:40.449 --> 11:44.036
That's so cool.
Um, why haven't you gone back to that?

11:44.370 --> 11:48.791
Oh, it's complicated.
I started the company with my best friend.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.002
And then she slept with my fiancé...

11:53.003 --> 11:54.171
while I was in prison.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.174
They slept with each other.
They're still together.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.968
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.177
Holy shit, woman.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.347
So, what is it exactly that you do here?

12:03.848 --> 12:06.684
I help nonprofits raise money.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.270
Right now,
I'm working on this big benefit gala.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.355
But say more about this fiancé.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.524
What was her name?
It's a small town, maybe I know her.

12:13.607 --> 12:14.442
Larry.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.194
Excuse me.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.904
Mmm-hmm.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.534
Clearly, I don't know enough
about pre-prison Piper.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.288
So, are you still in contact
with them at all?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.999
I don't think they wanna hear from me.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.835
The way we left things was pretty ugly.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.712
But if you call and try and work it out,

12:34.795 --> 12:37.465
then the way you left things
is no longer the way you left things.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.175
You can reset.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.429
I guess I've been waiting to feel
like I'm ready to deal with all of that.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.016
Piper, you will never
feel like you're ready.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.685
You just have to go for the pose

12:49.769 --> 12:53.522
and maybe you'll fall nose-first
into someone's sweaty buttcrack,

12:53.981 --> 12:56.901
but exactly nothing happens
if you just stand there,

12:56.984 --> 12:58.444
and you can't fix nothing.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.988
See this phone of yours...

13:01.071 --> 13:02.072
What are you doing?

13:02.156 --> 13:02.990
Larry, you say?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.869
There you go.
Call them now, right here.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.413
What? No, that's a terrible idea.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.290
Don't think, just do.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.334
And, hey, if it royally sucks,
at least you know

13:13.417 --> 13:16.796
you have someone here on your side
at the end of it, no matter what.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.131
-I can't believe I'm doing this.
-Just trust me.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.426
I'll grab us some little cookies
as a reward.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.937
Try that. Where does that go?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.440
Close. See, we're working on
your fine motor skills.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.109
-Yeah, motor skills. Yeah.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.737
I mean, mine are better than yours,
but you're getting there.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.656
-You're really improving.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.451
-Right here.
<i> Hi, Larry?</i>

13:47.535 --> 13:49.328
Yeah, hi. Who's this?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.205
Piper?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.875
Yeah, it's Piper. I'm out.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.879
You're out
You're out of prison. Oh, my God.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.091
Whoa. That's incredible. Congratulations.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.176
Who is it?
-It's Piper. Piper.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.804
Hold on, Piper. Polly just walked in.
I'm putting you on speaker.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.100
Hi, Polly. How are you?

14:11.809 --> 14:12.852
Good.

14:13.769 --> 14:17.273
Good. Uh...
Um, I'm surprised to hear from you.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.110
<i> Yeah. Well, I'm out of prison. </i>

14:21.652 --> 14:26.323
And I was wondering if you...
well, if you... both of you...

14:27.908 --> 14:29.618
Sorry, I know this is awkward,

14:29.702 --> 14:33.247
<i>so don't feel like you have to,</i> <i>but...</i>

14:33.914 --> 14:36.166
I was wondering
if maybe you'd wanna get coffee.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.253
Oh. We're off coffee these days.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.671
<i>Okay, that's okay. Totally.</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:42.840
No problem. I understand.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.800
Do you wanna do--
What?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.051
What?
<i> Dinner?</i>

14:46.552 --> 14:47.636
Yeah, dinner would be great.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.098
Okay. Um, you remember that sushi place
we used to go to?

14:51.181 --> 14:54.435
The secret one under the parking garage
that was actually pretty good?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.646
I love that place.
With the sushi guy who yo

14:57.730 --> 14:59.398
Yes, exactly. I'll make a rezzy.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.443
Polly and I have been wanting
a date night, anyway. So, perfect.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.528
He's sorry for already
putting his foot in his mouth.

15:04.862 --> 15:05.821
<i> It's okay.</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:08.282
It'll be great to see you guys.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.409
Did he have his yogurt? Bye, Piper.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.327
Bye.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.996
<i> I can't eat sushi, either.</i>
<i>All of the plastic in the oceans...</i>

15:14.079 --> 15:16.040
<i>There's other things on the menu.</i>
<i>Bye, Piper.</i>

15:16.123 --> 15:17.374
Bye-bye. Bye.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.084
<i> He just spread it across his face.</i>

15:19.168 --> 15:20.961
<i>-I think he got a tablespoon.</i>
<i> A tablespoon?</i>

15:21.045 --> 15:22.713
<i>-He needs to have a whole squeezy.</i>
<i> I tried--</i>

15:22.796 --> 15:24.673
<i> It's okay. You're a good dad.</i>
<i>Thanks, babe.</i>

15:27.635 --> 15:32.264
And I-- I don't expect you to forgive me
for what I did to you.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.269
Honestly, I don't even remember doing it,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.064
trying to-- to drown you.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.192
But I know that I did.
I'm not saying that I didn't.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.568
What am I supposed to say to that?

15:44.652 --> 15:49.406
It's tough. But the positive here is that
Beth is not denying your experience.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.242
She's totally admitting
she caused you pain.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.621
I think it's up to you to let her know

15:55.704 --> 16:00.042
what else you think
can create justice in this situation.

16:01.919 --> 16:02.753
Come on, now.

16:07.967 --> 16:13.847
I guess I think justice would be
keeping her locked up

16:13.931 --> 16:17.393
and away from everyone in here
as much as possible.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.729
Uh, if she doesn't have
control of herself,

16:21.689 --> 16:23.524
don't we have to protect people from her?

16:24.108 --> 16:27.695
So-- So you never do things
that you can't explain?

16:27.778 --> 16:32.408
Not like that.
Not so violent against another person.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.867
Really?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.746
Do you have, like, a split personality
or something?

16:38.038 --> 16:39.456
Or am I just not a person to you?

16:41.709 --> 16:46.755
CO Dixon, this program is mainly
for the inmates and their victims.

16:46.839 --> 16:51.260
I know. I'm a victim, she's an inmate.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.723
And I'd like to confront my perpetrator,
same way she got to.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.560
Uh, the victims go through training
on how to process their trauma

16:59.643 --> 17:01.729
before confronting their offenders.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.106
-I would be happy to help you--
-It's okay.

17:06.025 --> 17:06.900
He's right.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.780
If he wants to talk to me,
can we let him talk?

17:17.244 --> 17:19.455
Okay. Okay.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.999
Beth, thank you. Good work.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.419
CO Dixon, why don't you have a seat?

17:29.048 --> 17:34.219
Why don't you start by telling
the offender what happened to you?

17:39.850 --> 17:42.936
During the riot, you held me hostage.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.064
Yes.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.983
I'm sorry about that.  You imprisoned me,

17:51.779 --> 17:52.905
you tortured me,

17:54.823 --> 17:56.241
you humiliated me,

17:58.744 --> 18:00.454
and I haven't been the same ever since.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.793
When the alarms went off during
the lockdown yesterday, it all came back.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.837
I still can't sleep.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.382
And even when I try to fall asleep,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.676
all I can see are nightmares
of you and your baton.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.639
And I'll never be able
to use a port-a-potty again.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.357
I am so, so sorry.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.155
I put you through some awful shit.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.991
No pun intended.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.620
And what I did to you
is still messing you up.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.794
Look, I-- I-- I can't take it back.
I wish I could.

18:49.378 --> 18:55.092
But I hope it maybe helps you a little
that I do know what I did to you.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.387
And I'm trying real hard
to be a better person

18:58.470 --> 19:03.559
so no one else ever has to feel
the way you feel because of me.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.237
-No.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.532
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.081
Hey. Hey, come here. I've done some fucked-up shit, too.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.339
Thank you for apologizing.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.342
It doesn't fix anything,
but it means a lot.

19:43.932 --> 19:47.978
Okay. Okay. Great work, everybody.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.355
Wow.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.900
I think we all just saw
how restorative justice

19:52.983 --> 19:56.862
can lead us to some unexpected places
if we give it a chance.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.490
I'll see you all next class. Good work.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.075
Let's go.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.761
Hi.

20:23.305 --> 20:28.477
Um, I'm just here to make sure
we're still on for dinner next week.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.439
My boyfriend is way too excited
to cook for other people.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.735
Fig will make a show
of pushing food around her plate,

20:36.818 --> 20:38.487
-and I'll eat for both of us.
-Okay.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.781
-I look forward to it. Thank you.
-Me, too.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.450
Um...

20:45.619 --> 20:49.373
I hope you're proud of the work
you're doing here, Mr. Caputo.

20:50.540 --> 20:56.004
I think we are really starting to see
the positive impacts of our programs.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.302
<i> Russia, today,</i>
<i>is regarded,</i>

21:02.386 --> 21:04.513
<i>as a grave threat to our nation,</i>

21:04.596 --> 21:09.851
<i>to our freedom, to the peace of the world.</i>
<i>Why so </i>

21:10.519 --> 21:13.188
<i>Looking closer, we see a clue. </i>

21:13.272 --> 21:14.147
Excuse me.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.650
This isn't on the test.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.318
So?

21:18.694 --> 21:22.114
So? We aren't learning anything
we need to know.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.450
I am. History is a continuum
that loops around.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.411
No.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.372
Hey, when are we gonna get a teacher
who actually teaches?

21:30.455 --> 21:33.041
I don't know.

21:33.959 --> 21:38.880
Whenever they get one approved
by the BOP, so... a few months?

21:39.923 --> 21:41.466
That's after the GED test.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.639
You want me to teach you somethin'?
Here's an important life lesson.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.101
She who does not care
can never be disappointed.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.895
Try caring less.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.148
Substitutes always suck.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.524
Fine.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.568
Class dismissed.

21:59.651 --> 22:03.071
Wait. "The proletarians had nothing
to lose but their" what?

22:14.666 --> 22:17.669
Don't ask for math help or some shit,
'cause I don't do that.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.589
Nah. I got a business proposition for you.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.634
You like math in your bank account?

22:25.302 --> 22:29.056
Hold on. I think you're about to ask me
to do somethin' illegal.

22:33.810 --> 22:36.271
Okay, I'll do it.

22:37.814 --> 22:38.940
You don't even know what it is.

22:39.024 --> 22:43.487
Let me guess.
You want me to sneak somethin' in for you.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.863
Uh...

22:45.614 --> 22:47.449
You sell it, I get a cut.

22:48.033 --> 22:48.867
Yep.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.911
We're getting fentanyl patches

22:50.994 --> 22:52.621
'cause they're easier to hide
inside books,

22:52.704 --> 22:54.581
and you can bring the books in this class.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.458
Nah, if I bring in books,
they'll be suspicious.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.627
I'll keister it.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.256
Okay. People usually don't volunteer
to do that.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.301
That's the best way, trust me.
No one wants to look up my turd pipe.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.222
Well, since it don't matter to you
what you stick up there,

23:11.098 --> 23:13.975
it's gonna be pills
'cause they're easier to get.

23:14.601 --> 23:18.063
Fine by me. Hey, if I don't bring it in,
some other asshole will.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.193
My people will be in touch.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.698
You get it

23:30.492 --> 23:33.078
Nothin'? Jesus.

23:35.997 --> 23:40.419
It is a beautiful, bountiful day
in New Cluck City.

23:41.128 --> 23:41.962
Yeah.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.842
Oh.  Look at that one,
flapping its happy little wattles.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.305
Oh. No, look at that one,
just chilling and laid-back.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.516
Aww. It's sunning.

23:55.142 --> 23:59.104
Taking a sun day,
on a Saturday.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.856
No.

24:02.399 --> 24:06.069
I think Lady Cacciatore
has gone the way of all flesh.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.407
Oh.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.327
Maybe she just got a sunstroke.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.037
You know how addicts,

24:16.121 --> 24:18.623
when they get clean, and they overdose
'cause they lost their tolerance?

24:18.707 --> 24:21.585
Maybe she got too much sun
'cause she's just used to the shade.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.420
-It's just sad.
-No.

24:25.005 --> 24:25.964
This was a murder.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.425
The thirteenth?

24:30.177 --> 24:34.181
Family nefarious,
genus vituperrious, species chicken.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.141
Oh, you were right about her.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.020
Well, what are we supposed to do?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.566
We're going to isolate it
so it doesn't strike again.

24:47.152 --> 24:51.198
We can't let it disrupt the peaceful, law-abiding lives of the others.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.792
What about the chicken that got killed?

25:05.253 --> 25:06.338
It's dead.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.424
What are we supposed to do with its body?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.425
We eat it.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.761
No, we are going to secretly bury it,

25:12.844 --> 25:16.681
and we are going to pretend
like this never happened.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.102
This is startin' to feel
a little familiar.

25:23.396 --> 25:27.692
-Not too bad, thank you for asking.

25:27.776 --> 25:31.947
I learned a new stitch today,
the Double Tunisian.

25:32.614 --> 25:37.869
It gives you some open, airy space
in whatever you're makin'.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.378
You had a major crisis incident

25:46.461 --> 25:49.798
in which a psychotic inmate
was found in one of your chicken programs?

25:49.881 --> 25:54.052
Good afternoon.
I wouldn't call it a major crisis.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.889
This is a corrections facility,
not a Waldorf school.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.684
These programs have been
nothing but problematic.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.603
And I just passed Joe Caputo
in the hallway.

26:04.312 --> 26:09.025
Joe Caputo. Apparently, he's in charge
of some kind of group therapy?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.027
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

26:12.028 --> 26:13.029
Yes.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.992
I am saving you a lot of money.

26:18.702 --> 26:22.831
When we give people goals and activities,
they are far less likely to act out.

26:23.373 --> 26:26.126
We've already seen
fewer violent confrontations,

26:26.209 --> 26:28.795
which means you're not spending
as much on medical.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.340
So, the GED program saves you money.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.385
The farm therapy program saves you money.

26:35.468 --> 26:39.139
And I'm not sure what
your personal history is with Joe Caputo,

26:39.222 --> 26:43.351
but the very good work he's doing here
is saving you money.

26:44.769 --> 26:45.770
I appreciate that.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.607
But know that
your grace period here is over,

26:48.690 --> 26:53.278
and I will have no problem replacing you
the second anything else goes wrong.

26:54.904 --> 26:55.739
Understood.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.034
If anything else
should need your attention,

26:59.492 --> 27:01.411
I will be the one to inform you.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.131
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.925
-Yeah.

27:17.177 --> 27:21.056
I'm fine. Just feel dumb
that you saw me like that earlier.

27:22.265 --> 27:24.559
They said the missing inmate
might have a weapon,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.436
so I just freaked out.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.729
Lorna?

27:30.231 --> 27:31.066
Sorry.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.738
I know it's irrational,
but when the riot started,

27:36.821 --> 27:40.492
I didn't know when it was gonna end,
you know? It kept escalating.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.496
So now, even when little things happen,
I think,

27:45.163 --> 27:48.083
"Is this the beginning
of something really fucked up?"

27:54.381 --> 27:55.965
I thought you weren't doing that anymore.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.177
I did, too.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.473
It's okay. This fucking place.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.060
Ow.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.437
Shit.

28:22.325 --> 28:26.830
It's like a fear takes over
my whole body,

28:28.248 --> 28:30.083
and then, when it passes,
it makes no sense

28:30.166 --> 28:32.502
'cause it's like
everything's just fine again.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.550
I need a way to feel like
something bad happened,

28:39.551 --> 28:44.139
or to let it out, you know?
Just so I know I didn't imagine it.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.143
We're gonna find another way.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.943
Have you seen my eyeliner sharpener?

28:57.569 --> 29:01.322
-You look amazing.

29:02.407 --> 29:06.119
I think that you could pass
for six months and three days.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.581
-Sparkling apple cider.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.418
Congratulations, babe.
It's a big fuckin' deal.

29:19.382 --> 29:24.179
-I made dinner reservations for us.
You did not tell me.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.181
Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.893
I already made plans with my sponsor
and some of my AA group.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.686
We're going out after the meeting tonight.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.564
Oh. Well, I guess
you didn't tell me that, either.

29:34.647 --> 29:39.444
Well, you usually work on Saturday nights,
and you know you're invited.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.613
-You're always invited.
-Okay.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.907
Oh, come out with us.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.701
Why are you acting so butthurt?

29:46.785 --> 29:49.496
I don't know. Maybe it's because
you have this whole new life,

29:49.579 --> 29:51.873
and you say things like "butthurt" now.

29:52.248 --> 29:55.335
I do have a whole new life.
I thought that was the point.

29:55.418 --> 29:58.713
It is. I just don't feel like
I'm a part of it.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.800
Oh, come on, Alex.
Of course you're a part of it.

30:02.342 --> 30:06.513
But it took a village to get me this far.
It wasn't only you.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.807
And my sober friends
are really important to me,

30:08.890 --> 30:11.559
and you have not even tried
to get to know them.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.021
I just wanted it to be
the two of us tonight.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.733
Well, I am sorry.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.829
Wait a second,
I thought you were done with him.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.706
-He didn't mean to.

30:34.749 --> 30:37.961
But, yeah, I am. I am. I'm done with him.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.505
Unless he's not done with me.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.760
Walkin' in, fresh meat.

30:49.472 --> 30:53.017
Weren't you gonna catch up with Sylvie
and drink some ginger beers?

30:53.101 --> 30:57.021
Yeah. Maybe one more round
of the real stuff, though.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.274
Sweet. You're buying.
Right, Daddy Warbucks?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.442
-Always.

31:08.992 --> 31:13.079
"Find the length of the hypot... hypot..."

31:13.162 --> 31:14.539
"Hypotenuse."

31:15.248 --> 31:17.166
-Hypotenuse.

31:17.250 --> 31:21.921
For hypotenuse, I think of "cut the hype,"

31:22.463 --> 31:24.757
'cause it reminds me of cuttin' a corner.

31:24.841 --> 31:30.638
So, for example, right?
I used to cut the hypotenuse

31:30.722 --> 31:34.142
through Mr. O'Connor's yard
on the way home from school.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.144
Yeah, like, "Hey, get off my lawn."

31:36.227 --> 31:39.731
Well, Mr. O'Connor's yard
was more of a junkyard, not a lawn,

31:39.814 --> 31:45.320
and he had this pit bull on a chain
named Salmon, but whatever. You get it.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.990
Heard you're tutoring?
New teach is, like, horri-bad.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.785
Yeah, Luschek has many gifts,
but academics is the flaw in his tapestry.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.288
You okay with that?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.042
I mean, as long as they wanna learn.

32:00.460 --> 32:04.339
All right, go and sit down.
We're on page 58.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.177
Damn!

32:10.470 --> 32:12.347
You're all waiting to buy?

32:13.598 --> 32:17.310
I got plenty of quality shit
at reasonable prices.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.978
We're studying for the GED.

32:20.313 --> 32:24.692
Yo... Yo, the GED ain't worth shit.

32:25.485 --> 32:29.197
Yo, y'all wanna make it out there,
you need cash money,

32:29.447 --> 32:31.908
so you could afford a roof over your head,

32:31.991 --> 32:35.620
instead of shackin' up
with some pasty, bald one-and-done.

32:36.120 --> 32:40.208
So you could eat, instead of hustlin'
some bullshit pyramid scams.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.336
So you could afford a real fuckin' lawyer.

32:44.504 --> 32:48.216
So you don't gotta end up back in here
with your stank

32:49.759 --> 32:52.220
What the fuck a diploma
ever do for you out there?

32:53.346 --> 32:55.431
Exactly. So...

32:56.683 --> 32:58.851
You need a towel or somethin'?

32:58.935 --> 33:01.646
'Cause your sad life
is leakin' out all over the place.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.650
Yeah, yo. Can you just leave?
We gotta focus.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.196
Yeah, you know what? Fine. Psst.

33:10.279 --> 33:13.449
Y'all wanna waste your time
and also not get high?

33:14.325 --> 33:16.703
Knock yourselves out, bitches.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.788
GED.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.416
Peace.

33:22.583 --> 33:25.378
All right, so we're workin'
on the Pythagorean theorem.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.340
Let's go, kitchen crew.
Your Zamboni awaits.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.050
This is everybody for today.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.845
Is Red gonna be okay?

33:34.470 --> 33:37.223
That is a big question
that I don't know how to answer.

33:37.932 --> 33:40.226
Has anybody heard anything about Lorna?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.520
I heard she had a psychotic breakout.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.815
What
Did somebody see her?

33:45.898 --> 33:48.943
Ms. Nichols?
You've been requested in medical.

33:51.654 --> 33:52.947
Is this about Morello?

34:07.545 --> 34:08.880
Come in, Ms. Nichols.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.722
Um, I don't think she wants to see me.

34:17.805 --> 34:21.059
Well, have a seat so I can go over
the diagnosis with you.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.519
Diagnosis?

34:24.520 --> 34:25.980
It's okay, yeah. Come in.

34:37.200 --> 34:43.998
Ms. Reznikov, your symptoms are consistent
with early onset dementia.

34:46.834 --> 34:51.214
The rapid progression was probably
caused by an acute case of delirium

34:51.297 --> 34:55.468
that began while you were isolated
in the segregated housing unit.

34:56.552 --> 35:01.015
But your blood work also shows
a severe urinary tract infection,

35:01.099 --> 35:04.477
which almost certainly
intensified the delirium.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.023
We can treat the UTI
and the delirium with medication,

35:09.107 --> 35:13.402
but, unfortunately, the dementia will
continue to compromise her functioning.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.446
I can't say how quickly, but eventually,

35:15.530 --> 35:19.784
you'll need assistance
with all the activities of daily life.

35:23.704 --> 35:28.417
I asked Ms. Reznikov if there was
someone she trusts, and she said you.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.681
I'll give you two a moment.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.732
-I'm sorry.
-No.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.324
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.035
I'll be here, okay? I'm here.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.873
I'm here, okay? It's okay.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.293
It's okay.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.473
When you let in the murder bird,
did you know it was a killer?

36:24.557 --> 36:25.600
No.

36:26.934 --> 36:31.814
But I was advised to keep
the border strong against invaders,

36:31.898 --> 36:32.982
and I didn't listen.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.569
All I can do now is try to keep it
from happening again.

36:36.652 --> 36:40.531
So, I isolated the offender
away from the other chickens.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.867
You put the chicken in the SHU?

36:42.950 --> 36:46.120
SHU has a negative connotation.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.249
I put her in a therapeutic module.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.712
You can have mine.

36:55.671 --> 36:56.923
I'm not hungry.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.802
Let's just hope
you moduled the right chicken.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.431
What do you mean?
The murderer had to be the new chicken.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.059
Do you have a witness?

37:08.142 --> 37:13.356
No, but the new chicken was making
furtive movements and was acting shifty.

37:13.439 --> 37:18.027
Plus, everything was fine
before the new chicken showed up.

37:19.862 --> 37:20.863
Was it?

37:30.081 --> 37:32.541
"I used to think that it was all my fault.

37:33.084 --> 37:37.380
That I deserved to be treated shitty
by you. But I didn't."

37:39.006 --> 37:41.008
Uh, give me a break, Kimberly.
It was business.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.094
You made money, I made money.

37:43.177 --> 37:45.429
I didn't make you have sex with me,
like your last pimp.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.681
I treated you well.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.642
"You sent me out
with super dangerous guys,

37:49.725 --> 37:54.063
and I got trich...
trichomoniasis four times."

37:54.397 --> 37:57.149
Uh, but, Kim, you said you were okay
with the rough ones.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.734
Time out.

37:59.402 --> 38:03.698
If someone comes to me and tells me,
"This is what you did to me,"

38:04.282 --> 38:05.825
it's my job to listen to them.

38:05.908 --> 38:09.495
It's not my place to correct what
they're thinking or what they're feeling. Damiva, give up your seat.
Vazquez, I'm gonna play your victim.

38:16.627 --> 38:20.047
What up, Kim?
Oh, you lookin' kind of bald these days.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.635
Okay, Juanita. Okay, come on, now.
Let's take this seriously.

38:25.636 --> 38:30.766
Kim is gonna tell Ms. Vazquez
what she experienced as a victim.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.980
And I will use Kim's witness statement
to play her role.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.274
Juanita...

38:39.567 --> 38:41.861
-I want you--

38:43.279 --> 38:44.822
-Yes.
-Why'd you turn me in,

38:44.905 --> 38:48.159
you snitchin' bag whore?
I'm in prison now 'cause of you.

38:49.118 --> 38:52.830
"I turned you in
because someone needed to stop you."

38:54.623 --> 38:55.958
Sorry. Sorry.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.921
"I turned you in...

39:02.548 --> 39:06.761
because I didn't want other girls
to go through what I went through."

39:06.844 --> 39:09.180
Uh Well...

39:10.222 --> 39:12.767
you went through my coke
like a champ, I know that.

39:12.850 --> 39:17.730
Kim, you're a crazy little
powder puff girl

39:17.813 --> 39:19.190
You're not listening to me.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.569
I'm trying to tell you
what I went through because of you.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.738
What did you go through, Kim?

39:27.031 --> 39:30.576
"In the beginning,
I thought you were my friend.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.333
But if I didn't do what you wanted...

39:40.086 --> 39:43.089
you punished me.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.885
-I never knew what to expect."

39:48.552 --> 39:50.679
When you fuck for money, expect the life.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.725
-You're still not listening to me.
-And you weren't even that good at it.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.603
All the complaints I got on you
about too much teeth, stanky bush--

39:57.686 --> 40:01.107
She's trying to tell you
what you did to her,

40:01.190 --> 40:02.775
and you will not listen to her.

40:08.030 --> 40:11.325
Mr. Caputo, are you okay?

40:16.247 --> 40:17.331
I'm sorry.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.333
I'm sorry.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.883
I wish you would tell me
what really happened.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.262
Oh. But if it was you,
how can I believe anything that you say?

40:35.724 --> 40:38.811
Why is this one
in an inappropriately

40:40.146 --> 40:41.147
Misbehaved. Ah.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.693
Is this helping?

40:46.944 --> 40:48.821
-Hard to say.
No!

40:50.739 --> 40:52.158
No.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.202
No, this isn't happening.

40:55.286 --> 41:01.167
It sure is. Another jail bird,
gone to be with the chickens in the sky.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.043
I locked up an innocent chicken.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.504
Kitchen crew!

41:07.882 --> 41:10.009
No, she didn't.
I'm doing Duolingo.

41:13.345 --> 41:14.180
Hey.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.226
Hey, welcome back.

41:19.894 --> 41:20.895
You okay?

41:22.313 --> 41:25.566
Hey. Uh, I heard they found you
at the chicken coop,

41:25.649 --> 41:29.320
but, uh, that doesn't sound right.
You-- You hate the country life.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.531
I don't know.

41:33.949 --> 41:38.787
The last thing I remember is Vinnie...
Vinnie came to see me.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.999
And then, he took the baby away.

41:43.959 --> 41:46.253
And then, he said he wasn't coming back.

41:46.587 --> 41:50.299
-Mmm-mmm. He can't do that.
-No, he absolutely cannot do that.

41:51.091 --> 41:55.095
What do you mean,
uh, that he took the baby away?

41:55.179 --> 41:56.889
Just tell me what he said.

41:59.850 --> 42:03.103
Why don't you just get some rest
for now, okay?

42:03.771 --> 42:06.815
And I'm gonna try to find you
something decent to eat, okay?

42:09.777 --> 42:10.778
Shh.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.949
Here you go. Hold on. I'll get your feet.

42:16.575 --> 42:20.037
Okay. Got your little feet.
There you go, babe.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.170
You know,
you should've told me about this.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.968
No, I'm sorry,
because I should've been there for you.

42:34.635 --> 42:35.636
Uh...

42:36.554 --> 42:39.807
Yeah, I've just been
failing everybody lately.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.518
I'm hoping it's a phase, you know?
My, uh...

42:43.811 --> 42:46.897
I'm-such-a-fuckin'-asshole,
how

42:50.484 --> 42:51.318
Okay.

42:57.616 --> 42:59.034
I mean...

42:59.118 --> 43:00.327
I can't go.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.915
She can barely walk.
You know, I'm gonna stay here with her.

43:04.999 --> 43:09.295
Okay. I'll tell Ginger you're sick.
Otherwise, they're gonna make you go.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.421
Thanks.

43:11.630 --> 43:16.552
Uh, hey, just, uh, tell Shani
that I'm sorry I can't be there with her.

43:17.052 --> 43:19.763
Uh, tell her I've been
on a disappointing people spree,

43:19.847 --> 43:23.392
so she shouldn't feel alone
in my neglect, you know?

43:23.475 --> 43:25.185
I-- I'll see her as soon as I can.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.327
Up?

43:42.828 --> 43:43.829
Or down?

43:44.913 --> 43:48.626
It looks very elegant up,
but romantic down.

44:31.585 --> 44:34.922
Hi. I'm here to meet my friends.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.549
The reservation is under Bloom.
Larry Bloom.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.719
-Yes, let's see.
-And it's four people now.

44:41.136 --> 44:43.263
-Hi, I'm here.
Yes, four people.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.181
I'm the fourth.

44:44.264 --> 44:47.518
Ah. Thank you so much for doing this.
I know you're in very high demand.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.186
Of course. I'm here to buffer.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.355
Just call me
Buffer the Awkwardness Slayer.

44:51.438 --> 44:54.108
Your party is here. I believe
they're waiting for you at the bar.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.359
Let's do this.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.194
Oh.

44:58.153 --> 45:01.657
You were engaged to him?
Very nice. I get it.

45:02.783 --> 45:06.537
No, Larry is a different... type.

45:08.288 --> 45:10.165
Hi. Larry.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.084
-Hi. Piper, hi.
-Hi.

45:12.167 --> 45:13.001
Hi. Wow.

45:17.172 --> 45:20.884
I wanted to see if they still had
those amazing Japanese toilets.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.553
-Mmm-hmm.
-They do.

45:22.636 --> 45:24.888
My asshole is incredibly clean right now.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.811
This is my friend Zelda.

45:30.894 --> 45:34.565
Oh. Hi, I'm-- I'm Larry.

45:34.648 --> 45:38.944
Zelda. I've heard only
scandalous things about you,

45:39.027 --> 45:40.946
but I'm relieved to know
that at the very least,

45:41.029 --> 45:43.574
your anus is immaculate.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.412
-Yeah, let's do that.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.000
<i> Hi, it's Piper.</i>
<i>I'm not available right now.</i>

46:11.852 --> 46:12.728
<i>Piper.</i>

46:13.270 --> 46:14.271
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hey.</i>

46:14.354 --> 46:15.898
<i>-Concentrate.</i>
<i>-Oh, yeah.</i>

46:15.981 --> 46:18.192
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Look at that form.</i>

46:19.568 --> 46:23.280
<i>She's got the form. She's got the form.</i>

46:25.365 --> 46:26.325
<i>She did it.</i>

46:31.163 --> 46:33.999
<i>-I can't do a headstand.</i>

46:38.337 --> 46:41.006
<i> I think she did a headstand.</i>
<i>I can't do a headstand.</i>

46:42.883 --> 46:45.928
Get out!
And stay the fuck away from her!

46:48.013 --> 46:52.518
Unbelievable.
You were already cheating on me?

46:52.601 --> 46:55.479
You didn't have to punch her.
I thought we were on pause.

46:55.562 --> 46:57.481
Why the fuck would you think
we're on pause?

46:57.815 --> 46:59.191
Maybe because you screamed at me,

46:59.274 --> 47:01.860
you broke a lamp
and then you disappeared for three days?

47:01.944 --> 47:04.238
I told you,
I was trying to figure shit out!

47:04.988 --> 47:10.244
You can't just decide to go fuck the first
J. Crew sale rack that comes along!

47:11.370 --> 47:13.872
Sylvie, we are not
in the same thing anymore.

47:13.956 --> 47:20.254
No. No, you... you need me to be broken
so you feel needed,

47:20.337 --> 47:23.298
and now that I'm doing better,
you're pushing me away.

47:23.382 --> 47:24.508
Oh, is that what's going on?

47:24.591 --> 47:26.009
I'm not your fuckin' father.

47:27.427 --> 47:29.304
I'm not gonna walk out on you.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.307
This is what you do.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.601
You are so afraid of losing control

47:34.685 --> 47:38.063
that you just blow shit up
before anyone can hurt you.

47:53.036 --> 47:55.080
<i> Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>Look at all these cookies!</i>

47:56.707 --> 47:58.709
<i>Cookies. Ha!</i>

48:52.262 --> 48:53.263
Am I stupid?

48:54.890 --> 48:55.974
What do you mean?

49:00.103 --> 49:01.772
We're not doing anything wrong.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.399
I am a prisoner taking a shower,

49:05.859 --> 49:07.945
and you're a CO who's watching me.

49:09.237 --> 49:13.200
No, like, am I stupid
for thinking this is a thing?

49:14.076 --> 49:15.827
Like, a real thing?

49:17.287 --> 49:20.248
Because I feel like I'm... I'm...

49:21.083 --> 49:22.334
You're not stupid.

49:32.427 --> 49:33.804
I miss them. I do.

49:33.887 --> 49:36.473
Cal and I had some solid man-time
out in the woods.

49:36.556 --> 49:37.766
Oh, you should call him.

49:37.849 --> 49:40.852
I bet he'd love to see you.
You two could have a dad date.

49:43.355 --> 49:44.398
I think we're past weird.

49:44.481 --> 49:48.443
I mean, you guys are together,
I'm married, we're all okay.

49:48.527 --> 49:49.361
You're married?

49:50.404 --> 49:52.155
Oh, no, to Alex.

49:54.408 --> 49:55.909
How's

49:57.202 --> 49:58.370
It's good.

49:59.079 --> 50:03.166
I mean, as you know,
it's hard when one of you is in prison.

50:03.250 --> 50:09.256
But I think we're finding a way
to stay connected and open.

50:10.882 --> 50:15.095
With each other,
not like an open relationship.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.389
Although, we did try that.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.768
-It never works.
-That's not what she said--

50:21.852 --> 50:23.020
She implied it.

50:24.604 --> 50:25.897
Sasa dango.

50:27.691 --> 50:28.608
You remembered.

50:28.692 --> 50:30.694
They don't have it on the menu anymore,
but you can get it by request.

50:31.028 --> 50:31.903
Larry.

50:33.488 --> 50:34.656
Warm sake?

50:35.240 --> 50:37.117
-Oh, none for me.

50:37.701 --> 50:39.161
But you love warm sake.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.038
I know.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.335
I'm pregnant.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.468
-Wow.

50:55.427 --> 50:56.261
That was fast.

50:56.928 --> 51:00.432
-Well, we wanted them to be close in age.
Close, yeah.

51:01.850 --> 51:02.684
It's a boy.

51:03.643 --> 51:05.187
I'm gonna have a house full of dick.

51:05.270 --> 51:07.147
-You're our queen bee.

51:07.773 --> 51:10.650
My sister and I are 16 months apart.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.819
We fought constantly up until puberty,

51:12.903 --> 51:16.281
and then, we just suddenly decided
we loved each other the most.

51:16.364 --> 51:17.824
And she is my best friend.

51:18.366 --> 51:21.870
Okay, so only the next 12 years
will be rough. Noted.

51:23.789 --> 51:26.583
I'm happy for you. I mean it.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.169
I'm glad that you two have each other.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.425
So, three cards?

51:35.509 --> 51:37.177
-Let's split it, Larry.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.178
I got you.

51:40.138 --> 51:41.014
There you go.

51:48.522 --> 51:51.316
-It's so great to be back on crack, kids.

51:51.691 --> 51:57.239
Yeah, except fenty ain't cheap-ass crack.
It's fuckin' strong.

51:57.322 --> 51:59.116
Way better than your mom's shit.

52:00.242 --> 52:03.370
You should-- You should call it that,
Not Your Mom's Shit.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.705
Isn't fentanyl what killed Prince?

52:05.789 --> 52:07.374
Mmm. Call it Purple Rain.

52:07.457 --> 52:10.210
I think Not Your Mom's Shit
is more distinctive, -and it speaks more to our local market.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.591
Can I take your tray for you?

52:20.929 --> 52:23.014
That's how y'all ought to be
treating me around here.

52:23.431 --> 52:25.851
Wanna pay me
to put your tampons in for you?

52:26.518 --> 52:28.854
Ugh!
What the fuck is the matter with you?

52:28.937 --> 52:32.691
Nothin'. I heard the Kardashians
have a person. I'm tryin' to keep up.

52:35.944 --> 52:36.903
May I join you?

52:37.946 --> 52:38.947
Fuck off, ferret.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.159
Seems like you could use a friend.

52:43.326 --> 52:46.955
Yo, I like to eat alone.
Lookin' at rodents turns my stomach.

52:49.332 --> 52:50.959
Your relation has a new connect.

52:56.381 --> 52:59.426
Daya got a new pipeline

53:00.093 --> 53:03.555
Maybe you don't like rodents,
but moles can be useful.

53:11.146 --> 53:11.980
Yeah.

53:13.106 --> 53:16.735
Good. Then she's watching
her enemies join forces.

53:27.495 --> 53:30.832
Hey, they just confirmed next Friday
for our IVF.

53:32.834 --> 53:35.295
Hello? Next Friday might be the day

53:35.378 --> 53:37.923
your sperm and my egg
finally get their shit together

53:38.006 --> 53:40.592
-and move into my uterus.

53:40.675 --> 53:42.969
-I have to resign.
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.805
-Hi. So glad you're here.
-Hi.

53:45.889 --> 53:48.266
-Us, too.
-Yeah. It's great.

53:52.062 --> 53:55.065
So, I heard you had your first lockdown.
How'd you do?

53:56.483 --> 53:58.360
I think I did great.

53:58.443 --> 54:01.863
Uh, no small thanks
to Professor Caputo's class.

54:02.948 --> 54:05.867
You both have been
so ridiculously helpful.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.911
I don't know what I would've done
without you two.

54:07.994 --> 54:09.329
I bet you would've figured it out, -smart lady like you.

54:10.830 --> 54:16.211
Well, I know you think I can do anything,
but I'm just saying,

54:16.294 --> 54:20.298
uh, it was definitely easier
with your support.

54:21.925 --> 54:26.930
-Joe, Natalie, here's to you both.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.432
-Okay, the three of you.

54:30.934 --> 54:35.689
Well, I'm glad
that somebody's getting some benefit

54:35.772 --> 54:37.816
from all those years we spent in hell.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.943
Hmm.

54:41.069 --> 54:43.947
And not to keep talking shop,
but I gotta ask,

54:44.030 --> 54:46.658
how's it going with you
and hell bitch herself?

54:46.741 --> 54:49.828
-I gotta resign from restorative justice.
-No, you don't.

54:50.161 --> 54:52.706
He's overreacting.

54:53.373 --> 54:54.416
To what?

54:56.376 --> 54:58.169
There is a restraining order against me.

54:58.253 --> 55:01.298
It's bullshit.
He got Me-Too'd over nothing.

55:01.381 --> 55:02.257
It wasn't nothing.

55:03.591 --> 55:05.468
And I didn't get Me-Too'd.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.054
I was not the victim.

55:09.347 --> 55:10.181
So, you did it?

55:11.850 --> 55:12.934
Did what?

55:14.019 --> 55:16.146
Yes, I did it.

55:17.272 --> 55:21.901
There was a young woman, Susan Fischer.
She was a CO at camp, and I liked her.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.695
And it was inappropriate.

55:24.654 --> 55:29.034
I created an atmosphere at work
that was sexualized

55:29.117 --> 55:33.330
and it made her uncomfortable,
and I crossed lines I shouldn't have.

55:34.873 --> 55:39.878
And when she rejected me, I fired her.

55:40.587 --> 55:41.755
Hmm.

55:41.838 --> 55:46.092
It's not the only reason he fired her.
She wasn't exactly a star CO.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.184
You do have to resign.

55:55.685 --> 55:56.519
Yeah.

56:01.399 --> 56:02.567
Well, uh...

56:03.985 --> 56:05.487
I made profiteroles.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.869
Do you think
that some relationships...

56:14.245 --> 56:15.789
I don't know, complete?

56:17.415 --> 56:23.171
Like, you reach the end of them,
and you don't need anything else there?

56:24.130 --> 56:25.924
-Yes.
-Oh.

56:26.007 --> 56:30.929
Yes, and also, I think some relationships
never do, in a good way.

56:31.930 --> 56:35.600
They just continue to evolve,
surprise you.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.900
Well, I am zonked. I'll see you at yoga?

56:44.317 --> 56:46.152
Yes, okay. I'll see you there.

56:52.075 --> 56:55.578
I want you to know, I fully support
whatever shampoo you're using.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.748
Well...

57:01.084 --> 57:02.585
Thanks for a fun night, Piper.

57:07.507 --> 57:08.883
Would you want to...

57:13.430 --> 57:17.183
be my plus one at this gala thing?

57:17.976 --> 57:20.478
I'd love to. Good night.

57:21.563 --> 57:22.397
