00:58.726 --> 01:02.162
<i>Go for
comms, Delta Two. Sitrep.</i>

01:02.296 --> 01:05.700
<i>Ain't looking
good, LT. Soup sandwich in here.</i>

01:05.833 --> 01:07.434
<i>Four hostages down.</i>

01:10.038 --> 01:11.539
<i>Looks like
they interrogated them</i>

01:11.673 --> 01:13.273
<i>and dumped the bodies here.</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:15.577
<i>Echo Two, give me a sitrep.</i>

01:15.710 --> 01:19.981
<i>No sign
of alpha target. Moving location.</i>

01:47.742 --> 01:49.911
Contact, building two,
ground floor.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.497
<i>Bravo Six, hold on breach.</i>

02:13.300 --> 02:16.169
<i>Roger that. Breaching now.</i>

02:19.741 --> 02:21.809
<i>Delta, Echo, hustle.
Double time.</i>

02:21.943 --> 02:24.277
<i>Bravo's on location.
Goddamn it, Bravo Six,</i>

02:24.411 --> 02:25.813
<i>I said, hold on breach!</i>

03:13.928 --> 03:15.863
Drop your gun.

03:15.997 --> 03:18.398
I said, drop your gun!

03:27.041 --> 03:28.408
All right.

03:29.911 --> 03:31.411
Take it easy.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.583
What do you want?

03:35.717 --> 03:37.284
Helicopter. Now!

03:37.417 --> 03:38.886
<i>On location. Building two.</i>

03:39.020 --> 03:41.488
And tell them to back off!

03:41.622 --> 03:44.692
Alpha One, stand down.
We got this situation handled.

03:44.826 --> 03:46.027
<i>Roger that. Holding.</i>

03:47.528 --> 03:48.696
If you want a helicopter,

03:48.830 --> 03:50.330
you gotta give me a phone.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.102
- There.
- Where?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.570
There.

04:09.751 --> 04:12.954
<i>Bravo Six in sight.
Alpha target secure.</i>

04:24.966 --> 04:27.635
Why do these flights
always feel so long?

04:31.773 --> 04:33.608
That's what we fight for, guys.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.643
Oh, man, I need to get home.

04:35.777 --> 04:38.579
No mission too difficult,
no sacrifice too great!

04:38.713 --> 04:40.480
Duty first!

04:42.415 --> 04:44.417
That's it! To the hangar.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.423
Boss, I'll take that for you.

05:59.060 --> 06:01.195
You think someday...

06:01.329 --> 06:05.566
just once, you could come back
in the same shape you left?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.903
You don't like my scars?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.975
I don't mind the scars.

06:15.610 --> 06:17.545
I just don't like
the stories they tell.

06:20.281 --> 06:23.483
You know the funny thing
about the stories they tell?

06:23.618 --> 06:25.987
Is they all end the same.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.955
I always come home.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.192
Just saying,

06:31.325 --> 06:33.127
at some point,

06:33.261 --> 06:35.730
your body can't do this forever.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.272
Are you questioning
what my body can and can't do?

06:47.975 --> 06:51.545
Well, maybe I just need
a little reeducation.

07:32.253 --> 07:33.254
Baby?

08:07.922 --> 08:09.323
Oh, shit.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.429
Gina.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.601
What's your problem?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.188
You all right, mate?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.193
Yeah.

09:58.466 --> 09:59.400
Never gets old.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.337
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

10:03.471 --> 10:06.040
I'm the bloke
that ruined your vacation.

10:08.943 --> 10:11.445
Name's Martin Axe.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.149
So that's one for you.
Now one for me.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.719
Who tipped you off
about the hostages in Mombasa?

10:22.557 --> 10:23.457
Right, yeah.

10:23.592 --> 10:25.259
I thought you might clam up.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.761
That's why I brought
a little extra motivation.

10:36.337 --> 10:38.105
Look who it is.

10:42.611 --> 10:45.012
- Who's that?
- Gina.

10:49.016 --> 10:49.950
Hey.

10:51.285 --> 10:52.953
She has nothing to do with this.

10:54.355 --> 10:55.456
Once again, then.

10:55.590 --> 10:56.857
Who tipped you off?

10:56.991 --> 10:58.359
I don't know, man.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.295
That's not my job.
I go where they point me.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.775
Can she handle all six inches?

11:14.909 --> 11:16.443
Why am I asking you, eh?

11:18.613 --> 11:20.114
Hey, look at me.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.683
Look at me!

11:22.816 --> 11:26.053
I don't... I can't answer
because I don't know.

11:26.187 --> 11:28.155
If I knew, I would tell you!

11:28.289 --> 11:30.357
I don't know!

11:30.491 --> 11:32.661
You could ask me anything,
anything else,

11:32.793 --> 11:35.196
but this I can't tell you
because I don't know.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.406
Yeah, I believe you.

11:47.676 --> 11:50.010
Ray. Ray. Ray.

11:53.548 --> 11:55.416
- Ray.
- It's gonna be okay.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.090
Bad news, baby.

12:04.358 --> 12:05.560
It's not gonna be okay.

12:08.429 --> 12:10.565
- No! No!
- No, no, no.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.761
Oh, you're nothing.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.430
You don't even exist anymore.

12:43.565 --> 12:47.001
I swear, I will find you
and end you!

12:49.970 --> 12:52.273
You should kill me now

12:52.406 --> 12:54.609
because you won't have
a second chance.

12:54.743 --> 12:56.844
I promise you.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.950
Thanks for the advice.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.419
<i>Commence bioelectrical charge.</i>

13:40.588 --> 13:42.489
<i>Seventy-five percent.</i>

13:45.459 --> 13:47.027
<i>Full cycle.</i>

14:01.475 --> 14:03.578
<i>Project Bloodshot
procedure log,</i>

14:03.712 --> 14:05.045
<i>transfusion complete.</i>

14:10.050 --> 14:12.554
Subject awake and is stable.

14:29.504 --> 14:31.138
Hey. Hey, look at me.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.140
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You're okay.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.410
It's gonna be fine. It's okay.

14:37.878 --> 14:38.847
Where am I?

15:02.871 --> 15:04.238
Awake and cognitive.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.473
This is... This is phenomenal.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.644
Do I know you guys?

15:09.778 --> 15:12.614
I don't think so.
Welcome to RST,

15:12.747 --> 15:15.784
Rising Spirit Technologies.
I'm Dr. Emil Harting.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.953
This is my facility
and my colleague, KT.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.389
- Katie.
- Initials, KT.

15:23.725 --> 15:25.426
Will you look at me, please?

15:27.529 --> 15:31.131
Dilation looks good. No sign
of sub-macular hemorrhaging.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.066
There's no redness. Very clear.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.905
All right, what happened to me?
What am I doing here?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.072
Tell me,
do you remember anything?

15:39.206 --> 15:40.974
Anything's kind of broad,
don't you think?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.811
Of course. Let's keep it simple.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.313
What about your name,
rank, serial number?

15:46.447 --> 15:48.248
Of course.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.285
My name is...

15:55.956 --> 15:57.926
Rank, serial number?

15:58.058 --> 16:03.096
Yes, your body was donated
by the U.S. military.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.465
My body?

16:04.599 --> 16:07.201
It was either us
or Arlington, I'm afraid.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.539
Arlington, doc?

16:11.673 --> 16:15.510
I got some scars, but I'm not
ready for the cemetery.

16:15.643 --> 16:17.512
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

16:17.645 --> 16:19.681
but you got yourself killed.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.654
Okay.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.958
I'll play along.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.927
But if I died...

16:33.060 --> 16:35.496
somebody's waiting
for me to call them.

16:35.630 --> 16:38.766
Somebody must be waiting
for me to come home.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.769
Uh...

16:41.903 --> 16:44.171
It's difficult for me
to tell you this. Um...

16:44.304 --> 16:46.508
More difficult than
telling someone they died?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.545
- Um...
- Well, the military

16:50.678 --> 16:52.881
only anonymously donates
remains of soldiers

16:53.013 --> 16:57.251
who weren't claimed by family.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.588
Sorry. Sometimes you just
gotta rip off the Band-Aid.

17:00.722 --> 17:03.490
Helps to get through the pain
a bit quicker.

17:05.727 --> 17:08.362
But you don't need a history
to have a future.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.396
Listen to me. You're the first

17:10.531 --> 17:13.066
we've successfully managed
to bring back.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.737
And it has worked beautifully.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.506
You have been given something
that nobody else has.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.876
A second chance.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.748
A second chance.

17:32.987 --> 17:34.689
Whoa. Heh.

17:34.822 --> 17:37.057
Ain't what I was expecting.

17:38.793 --> 17:40.895
What are we doing
all the way out here, doc?

17:46.034 --> 17:47.835
RST focuses on rebuilding

17:47.969 --> 17:50.572
the most important asset
in the U.S. military,

17:50.705 --> 17:53.575
soldiers just like yourself.

17:53.708 --> 17:56.578
We are explorers
on a new frontier.

17:56.711 --> 17:59.581
We develop everything
from exoskeletal reconstruction,

17:59.714 --> 18:02.082
which makes soldiers
faster and stronger,

18:02.215 --> 18:05.118
to neural prosthetics, which
enhance the way they react.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.822
But you, my friend,

18:07.956 --> 18:10.090
you are the proof
that we are leading the way

18:10.223 --> 18:13.493
in the greatest human
advancement of all time.

18:13.628 --> 18:15.228
Come, I'll show you.

18:27.609 --> 18:29.944
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.714
The hell, doc?

18:37.852 --> 18:39.286
Holy shit.

18:45.093 --> 18:46.259
Let me explain.

18:47.762 --> 18:49.897
If you would
place your hand here, please.

18:51.032 --> 18:52.499
Now, look at this.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.372
Now, what the hell
are those things?

18:58.506 --> 19:00.207
Biomechanical constructs.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.876
<i>We call them "nanites."</i>

19:04.679 --> 19:06.446
<i>They intuitively enhance
your biology.</i>

19:06.581 --> 19:08.850
<i>Most notably,
they react very quickly</i>

19:08.983 --> 19:10.450
<i>to catastrophic injury,</i>

19:10.585 --> 19:12.787
<i>rebuilding damaged tissue.</i>

19:19.326 --> 19:22.329
- So those are in my blood?
- They are your blood.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.198
We had some success applying
them to single organ systems.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.801
We thought it was time to try

19:26.934 --> 19:30.605
- a full-body transfusion.
- Of course you did.

19:30.738 --> 19:32.540
Just like our own bodies
need calories,

19:32.674 --> 19:34.474
the nanites need
their own energy.

19:34.609 --> 19:35.943
And this lab supplies that.

19:36.077 --> 19:37.545
The more effort they make,

19:37.679 --> 19:39.346
the more energy they consume.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.382
- What's that glow?
- That's heat being generated

19:42.517 --> 19:44.952
by the nanites
battling malignant cancer,

19:45.086 --> 19:46.453
trying to save that mouse.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.859
The mouse that just died?

19:51.993 --> 19:54.862
Admittedly, some of the early
results were suboptimal.

19:54.996 --> 19:57.565
Maybe we should fast-forward
to the optimal part.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.834
That's you.
You're the optimal part.

19:59.967 --> 20:02.003
Because now we have
the ability to recharge

20:02.136 --> 20:03.403
when they're running low.

20:06.808 --> 20:08.776
Why can't I remember
anything about me?

20:08.910 --> 20:12.847
Because of who you were
and what you did.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.916
Sadly, everything about you
is classified.

20:15.049 --> 20:17.952
And that was all in your past.
This is your future.

20:18.086 --> 20:21.889
Listen, when I was a boy,
I was a tennis champion.

20:22.023 --> 20:24.726
And then when I was 15,
I got cancer.

20:24.859 --> 20:26.594
They took my arm
within six months.

20:26.728 --> 20:28.663
Instead of dwelling
on what I'd lost,

20:28.796 --> 20:31.065
I chose to focus
on who I could become.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.902
And so now, when a soldier
loses his arm,

20:35.036 --> 20:36.204
he gets a better one.

20:40.975 --> 20:42.710
This is our rehab facility,

20:42.844 --> 20:46.748
where patients come to test the
limits of their augmentations.

20:46.881 --> 20:49.917
You've already met KT,
ex-Navy swimmer.

20:50.051 --> 20:52.086
She was part of
a rescue deployment in Syria

20:52.220 --> 20:53.588
during a chemical attack.

20:53.721 --> 20:56.124
One laryngeal tracheal
reconstruction later

20:56.256 --> 20:59.727
and she now breathes through
a clavicle-mounted respirator.

20:59.861 --> 21:01.629
Makes her totally immune
to inhalants.

21:03.097 --> 21:04.665
Tibbs here graduated

21:04.799 --> 21:06.601
from Fort Benning,
top of his class.

21:06.734 --> 21:09.670
He became one of the Army's
most successful marksmen

21:09.804 --> 21:12.305
until an Iraqi mortar
took his sight.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.176
We've since remedied that
with ocular prosthetics.

21:15.308 --> 21:19.814
Gear-mounted camera arrays feed
directly into his optic nerves.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.250
- Which means now he sees...
- Everything.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.253
Welcome to the circus.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.288
And finally, Jimmy Dalton,
ex-Navy SEAL.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.125
Jimmy lost both his feet
to an Afghan IED,

21:31.259 --> 21:33.293
so we engineered him a new set.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.263
Part of Team Six.
Took out bin Laden.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.497
You and every other Navy SEAL.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.501
So we're wounded warriors.

21:40.635 --> 21:42.069
Not wounded.

21:42.203 --> 21:45.139
Improved. Enhanced.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.909
- Sounds cool.
- Yeah.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.110
Yeah.

21:52.246 --> 21:56.416
- Where you going?
- Oh, I'm gonna go back to sleep.

21:56.551 --> 21:59.452
Or maybe I'm just gonna wake up.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.792
So, what are
we supposed to do now?

22:04.926 --> 22:06.393
I think we just let him recover.

22:06.527 --> 22:09.030
Jimmy, will you walk him
to his room, please?

22:14.936 --> 22:17.905
- Wow, they spared every expense.
- When you're done with your nap,

22:18.039 --> 22:20.208
we'll be downstairs
doing our jobs.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.643
Yeah, I don't even know
what my job is.

22:22.777 --> 22:25.478
You'll find out.
When you're ready,

22:25.613 --> 22:27.248
I'll tell you everything.

22:59.180 --> 23:00.815
<i>No!</i>

26:22.950 --> 26:25.386
You're up late.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.321
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

26:31.392 --> 26:33.060
You know,
if I was dead yesterday,

26:33.194 --> 26:35.229
I wouldn't be able
to sleep either.

26:35.362 --> 26:39.233
Nah, I had a nightmare.
Which doesn't make any sense.

26:39.366 --> 26:42.336
How can you have a nightmare
if you have no memories?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.238
Trust me.

26:46.707 --> 26:50.478
Soon, you'll remember enough to
wish you could forget it again.

26:55.584 --> 26:57.718
That was pretty amazing
in there.

26:57.852 --> 26:59.987
A kata underwater.

27:00.121 --> 27:01.489
You know...

27:04.358 --> 27:06.494
we're all damaged goods here.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.496
But this is who I am now.

27:08.629 --> 27:10.331
I've embraced it.

27:13.234 --> 27:15.369
Hey, there's something
I want you to have.

27:20.241 --> 27:22.676
I carry it with me all the time.

27:22.810 --> 27:24.478
First time I served
on that ship,

27:24.613 --> 27:26.013
I was the only woman there.

27:26.147 --> 27:28.550
Master chief knew
that I had nobody...

27:30.351 --> 27:33.020
so he wanted to make a point
that I belong.

27:42.597 --> 27:44.131
I'm sure
there's someone out there

27:44.265 --> 27:45.766
who cares about you
a great deal.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.768
You just don't know it yet.

27:50.271 --> 27:51.705
I hope so.

27:52.973 --> 27:54.675
You look like
you could use a drink.

27:56.677 --> 27:59.648
I already know what I like,
so I guess it's time for you

27:59.780 --> 28:01.315
to find out what you like.

28:01.448 --> 28:02.883
Okay, go easy on me.

28:09.256 --> 28:11.025
To new beginnings.

28:22.571 --> 28:24.506
- I feel like I've been...
- <i>Ray.</i>

28:26.140 --> 28:28.008
Ray. Ray. Ray.

28:29.243 --> 28:31.045
- Are you okay?
- <i>Ray.</i>

28:32.413 --> 28:33.414
Hey.

28:36.817 --> 28:38.385
Gina.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.088
Name's Martin Axe.

28:41.222 --> 28:44.124
- She has nothing to do with this.
- Who?

28:44.258 --> 28:47.061
If I knew, I would tell you!

28:47.194 --> 28:48.663
Look at me.

28:53.635 --> 28:56.403
I will find you!

28:56.538 --> 28:58.839
I need medical in here now!
Listen to me.

28:58.973 --> 29:00.874
<i>Kill me now!</i>

29:01.008 --> 29:05.412
Kill me! Because you won't get
a second chance!

29:06.747 --> 29:08.349
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

29:10.484 --> 29:11.620
Hey. It's okay.

29:11.752 --> 29:13.454
- I'm sorry.
- Listen.

29:13.588 --> 29:15.356
Whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

29:15.489 --> 29:17.024
You don't understand, KT.

29:22.396 --> 29:24.798
I know why I'm alone.

29:39.714 --> 29:41.448
Where are you going?

29:49.390 --> 29:51.458
Where are you go...?
Can he hear me?

29:51.593 --> 29:53.728
Is the channel open?

29:53.861 --> 29:55.764
Eric, open a channel.

29:55.896 --> 29:57.666
And we're live.

29:57.798 --> 29:59.466
<i>Where are you going?</i>

30:01.536 --> 30:03.304
Doc, how are you talking to me?

30:03.437 --> 30:06.340
You have a billion wireless
microprocessors in your brain.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.342
I need you
to come back here right now.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.512
I've got unfinished business.

30:12.079 --> 30:14.915
What are you waiting for?
Go and get him.

30:15.049 --> 30:17.918
We're your only business.
We are the only people you know.

30:18.052 --> 30:21.155
<i>That's what you told me.
But I had a wife.</i>

30:21.288 --> 30:22.724
And he took her from me.

30:24.258 --> 30:26.226
What are you talking about?
Who did?

30:26.360 --> 30:28.195
Martin Axe.

30:36.705 --> 30:39.039
Eric, get me a terminal window.

30:43.712 --> 30:47.147
His nanites are scanning
the global search platforms.

30:53.354 --> 30:54.855
Wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

30:54.988 --> 30:56.957
You used my tech and scraped
a criminal database.

30:57.091 --> 30:59.326
That is beyond illegal.
I need you to come back now.

30:59.460 --> 31:01.362
<i>This isn't about what you need.</i>

31:01.495 --> 31:03.330
I'm sending Tibbs and Dalton
after you.

31:03.464 --> 31:05.032
They won't stop me.

31:05.165 --> 31:06.867
<i>This is not a-a-a hit job.</i>

31:07.000 --> 31:08.902
<i>It's...
It's a salvage operation,</i>

31:09.036 --> 31:11.972
and you are
a multibillion-dollar prototype.

31:12.106 --> 31:14.743
You're my
multibillion-dollar prototype.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.579
- I can't just have you...
- <i>Doc! I'm not yours.</i>

31:17.712 --> 31:19.880
<i>Besides, I always come home.</i>

31:20.013 --> 31:22.015
<i>You always come home? What?</i>

31:22.149 --> 31:24.686
Look, we don't know
what you're capable of.

31:24.819 --> 31:26.954
We don't even know
what you can take yet.

31:31.392 --> 31:33.227
Time for a live-fire test.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.362
Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just take a minute.

31:35.496 --> 31:37.297
Think about this.
You don't have money.

31:37.431 --> 31:39.634
- You don't have a passport.
- Flying private.

31:41.603 --> 31:44.773
One second. He's...

31:44.905 --> 31:46.940
- I got him at the hangar.
- The Gulfstream?

31:47.074 --> 31:50.110
No, no, no. I mean,
do you even know how to fly?

31:51.111 --> 31:52.814
I'll find a way.

31:52.946 --> 31:55.282
You'll find a way?
What does that...?

32:19.574 --> 32:22.242
<i>All clear. Time to move.</i>

32:22.376 --> 32:24.378
<i>All right. Radio it in.</i>

32:24.512 --> 32:25.613
<i>Let's go.</i>

32:25.747 --> 32:27.314
<i>ETA 20 minutes.</i>

32:46.634 --> 32:48.368
So how is he tracking him?

32:48.503 --> 32:50.605
Well, it appears
he cross-referenced

32:50.738 --> 32:53.140
every available
auto manufacturing database

32:53.273 --> 32:57.010
with live GPS data to identify
all the cars in the area.

32:57.144 --> 33:01.315
And then he pinged them
one at a time, all 9000 of them.

33:01.448 --> 33:02.650
Why?

33:04.117 --> 33:05.753
To find the five moving
in a convoy.

33:44.826 --> 33:47.695
- What the hell's going on?
- Team One, check ahead.

34:27.301 --> 34:29.168
Was that on purpose?

34:29.303 --> 34:31.539
- It's blocked.
- Really?

34:31.672 --> 34:33.273
Guys, was that on purpose?

34:33.407 --> 34:37.045
Team Two, take a look.
See if we can push through.

34:41.882 --> 34:42.784
Flour.

35:08.876 --> 35:10.310
Team One's down.

35:10.444 --> 35:11.913
What about the truck driver?

35:12.046 --> 35:13.615
Driver is...

35:15.583 --> 35:17.250
- He's gone.
- Dead?

35:17.384 --> 35:19.087
No, gone. He's not here.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.294
Oh, that's not good.

35:44.012 --> 35:45.813
He's down, boss.

35:54.622 --> 35:57.190
- Thermite. Engine's gone.
- This is not good.

35:57.324 --> 35:59.326
All teams, full sweep.
Eyes on everything.

35:59.459 --> 36:02.063
- See if there are more out there.
- We gotta get out of here.

36:02.195 --> 36:04.132
Sit down. My men will handle it.

36:11.338 --> 36:13.440
No, no, no, guys.
You're not listening!

36:13.574 --> 36:14.942
I need to get
out of this car now!

36:15.076 --> 36:17.812
First, we sweep,
then we switch cars!

36:31.626 --> 36:33.561
Let's take their car.

36:35.495 --> 36:36.396
Oh, man.

36:57.985 --> 36:58.886
Oh!

37:13.333 --> 37:14.401
Wait, what's that?

37:25.245 --> 37:26.714
Oh, man, it is him.

37:26.848 --> 37:29.282
Shit. Come on, come on, come on.

37:30.484 --> 37:31.886
- <i>What?</i>
- He's here!

37:32.019 --> 37:34.354
They finished it,
and he's right bloody here!

37:34.488 --> 37:37.091
<i>We all knew he wasn't
gonna let us walk away.</i>

37:44.297 --> 37:47.068
<i>Just let the professionals
we hired handle it.</i>

37:47.201 --> 37:50.004
Oh, sure. Small problem there.
Your guys suck!

37:57.310 --> 37:59.614
<i>Check on Wigans. See
where he is with that thing.</i>

37:59.747 --> 38:01.149
<i>Find out how much longer.</i>

38:01.281 --> 38:02.817
No, no, no.
Don't hang up. Don't...

38:02.950 --> 38:04.952
Oh, I'm screwed!

38:10.591 --> 38:13.895
- You see him?
- He's in the trailer.

38:14.028 --> 38:15.295
Fire!

38:24.906 --> 38:26.974
Cease fire!

39:56.330 --> 39:57.598
Bugger me.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.903
Shh, shh. Listen.

40:04.404 --> 40:07.474
- He can't get in, can he?
- Not a chance.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.243
Shit.

41:15.609 --> 41:17.111
Don't, please.

41:17.244 --> 41:19.814
Whatever Harting told you,
it's not true.

41:19.947 --> 41:23.084
No, wait. Don't.
You don't understand.

41:23.217 --> 41:25.453
He's lying to you.
I can help you.

41:25.586 --> 41:27.088
You're making a mistake.

41:27.221 --> 41:30.024
- Thanks for the advice.
- No!

41:46.007 --> 41:48.309
It's about time.

41:54.815 --> 41:55.750
Jesus.

41:57.151 --> 41:58.919
Look what they did to him.

42:02.356 --> 42:05.393
Gotta hand it to him.
The guy does damage.

42:14.135 --> 42:16.604
Are you okay?
How you feeling?

42:19.707 --> 42:22.576
I just saw the man
who murdered my wife.

42:23.978 --> 42:26.480
Looked him dead in the eyes

42:26.614 --> 42:28.482
and killed him.

42:33.120 --> 42:36.057
It won't change a thing
because, no matter what,

42:36.190 --> 42:38.893
my wife isn't coming back.

42:39.026 --> 42:41.929
Makes you wonder
if it's all worth it.

42:42.063 --> 42:43.697
Yeah, well, I'm done.

42:43.831 --> 42:45.699
Yeah, I'm done too.

42:48.235 --> 42:52.873
- What does that mean?
- She means we're all tired, bub.

42:53.007 --> 42:55.109
Gotta get you back to RST,
get you plugged in.

42:55.242 --> 42:56.944
Let's go.

43:01.215 --> 43:03.050
No one needed
to come collect me.

43:03.184 --> 43:05.386
I told Harting I'd come back.

43:05.520 --> 43:08.489
He sent us to make sure
you get back in one piece.

43:08.656 --> 43:10.157
Looks like we were almost late.

43:29.210 --> 43:30.945
What are you doing here, Dal...?

43:35.216 --> 43:37.084
That's right.

43:37.218 --> 43:39.153
You can't talk.

43:40.421 --> 43:41.556
Truth is...

43:45.025 --> 43:47.128
you aren't at the wheel
of your own body.

43:49.930 --> 43:51.765
We just shoved you aside
to watch

43:51.899 --> 43:54.869
as we shut down
your motor functions.

43:56.303 --> 43:57.638
Look at you.

44:00.641 --> 44:02.109
So angry.

44:02.243 --> 44:04.178
So driven.

44:07.081 --> 44:09.551
You think you're the good guy?

44:09.683 --> 44:11.218
That's a goddamn joke.

44:15.890 --> 44:17.559
You're an exhausting shit bird

44:17.691 --> 44:20.327
with a revenge button
we keep pushing.

44:21.462 --> 44:25.766
Much as I hate babysitting you,

44:25.900 --> 44:27.935
cleaning up after you,

44:28.068 --> 44:30.838
this little moment...

44:30.971 --> 44:34.975
this small part right here,
makes it all worthwhile.

44:41.448 --> 44:43.050
Gina.

44:45.252 --> 44:47.354
Sweet Gina.

44:50.592 --> 44:53.662
You really believe she's dead.

44:53.794 --> 44:58.567
Every goddamn time.

45:00.334 --> 45:01.835
There it is.

45:02.903 --> 45:04.171
That look.

45:05.540 --> 45:09.076
The dumbass catches on too late.

45:09.210 --> 45:12.079
Well, I may be an asshole,
but you're the toy soldier.

45:12.213 --> 45:15.517
We wind you up,
point you at the next victim,

45:15.650 --> 45:18.553
put you back in here
and then push this button.

45:24.024 --> 45:25.826
Ready to forget?

45:31.398 --> 45:33.434
Told you
I'd tell you everything.

46:55.883 --> 46:57.484
<i>Drop your gun.</i>

47:35.022 --> 47:37.491
<i>Delta Two. Sitrep.</i>

47:37.625 --> 47:40.027
<i>Contact. Building two.</i>

47:41.796 --> 47:43.163
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

47:51.305 --> 47:54.709
<i>Ain't looking good, LT.
LT. Hostages down.</i>

47:54.843 --> 47:58.479
<i>Delta Two. Sitrep.
Delta Two. Sitrep. Go for comms.</i>

47:58.613 --> 48:00.013
And initiate sequence.

48:02.015 --> 48:04.451
<i>Go for comms, Delta Two.
Sitrep.</i>

48:04.586 --> 48:06.554
<i>Four hostages down.</i>

48:13.026 --> 48:15.195
<i>Contact, building
two, ground floor.</i>

48:15.329 --> 48:16.930
"I'm done too"? I'm not sure

48:17.064 --> 48:18.932
what you're trying
to accomplish.

48:21.435 --> 48:25.072
Why does it matter if you're
gonna wipe his memory again?

48:25.205 --> 48:27.876
It's not him I'm worried about.
It's you.

48:28.008 --> 48:30.444
Everything we do here
specifically serves a purpose.

48:30.578 --> 48:32.446
The training, the alcohol,
the nightmare.

48:32.580 --> 48:34.783
- I know the script.
- Well, would you stick to it?

48:34.915 --> 48:36.417
You know that we're compromised.

48:36.551 --> 48:38.952
It doesn't work
if we don't check every box.

48:39.086 --> 48:42.423
What you're doing to him
is not fair and you know it.

48:42.557 --> 48:44.692
If you don't like it,
you're welcome to leave.

48:44.826 --> 48:46.960
Bullshit.
Just like your partners

48:47.094 --> 48:50.197
when they had a problem with it?
Like Baris?

48:52.199 --> 48:55.637
You know the moment
I walk out that door...

48:55.770 --> 48:58.706
- I can't breathe.
- That's the deal you agreed to.

48:58.840 --> 49:02.443
- That's the choice that you made.
- Well, he deserves to make his.

49:04.278 --> 49:06.980
What he deserves
is a military funeral.

49:07.114 --> 49:08.750
I'm sure
that's what he's gonna get.

49:08.883 --> 49:11.485
Jesus. You're just gonna
get rid of him?

49:13.721 --> 49:15.489
He's a soldier.
You can't do that.

49:15.623 --> 49:16.990
He's a dead soldier.

49:17.124 --> 49:18.325
He's a dead soldier.

49:18.459 --> 49:21.863
America makes new ones
every day.

49:21.995 --> 49:25.966
Listen, I will let you in
on a little secret.

49:26.099 --> 49:28.368
This is our last one, okay?

49:28.503 --> 49:29.871
And then we go to market

49:30.003 --> 49:32.039
with a technology
that will redefine warfare

49:32.172 --> 49:34.174
for the highest bidder
and then we're done.

49:34.308 --> 49:36.143
You're still gonna kill
innocent people.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.615
The only thing more important

49:40.748 --> 49:42.817
than the weapon
that I have created

49:42.951 --> 49:44.919
is being the only one
who knows how.

49:45.052 --> 49:46.086
Do you understand?

49:48.823 --> 49:50.725
Now, this is the point
in the script

49:50.859 --> 49:53.761
where you reset
his bunk room, please.

50:04.772 --> 50:06.641
Can you bring that up?

50:09.677 --> 50:11.044
Thanks for the advice.

50:42.376 --> 50:44.478
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

50:45.513 --> 50:47.682
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

50:49.017 --> 50:51.019
Goodbye, old friend.

51:20.414 --> 51:21.649
I love this part.

51:26.854 --> 51:28.255
Look at him.

51:30.925 --> 51:32.994
Enjoy it while it lasts.

51:36.129 --> 51:38.766
He's almost done. KT's up next.

51:44.505 --> 51:45.773
How'd you find Baris?

51:45.907 --> 51:48.442
Oh, Axe called his cell
while the big guy was...

51:48.576 --> 51:51.613
- doing what he does.
- Really?

51:51.746 --> 51:53.648
What story should I try next?

51:53.781 --> 51:55.950
Should I stick
with tennis or...?

51:56.084 --> 51:57.652
Or cricket, maybe.

51:57.785 --> 52:00.555
I'm from Jersey, but if you're
asking, I got script ideas.

52:00.688 --> 52:01.990
- I'll pass.
- Seriously?

52:02.122 --> 52:04.257
You've already ripped off
every movie cliché.

52:04.391 --> 52:06.728
I think "Psycho Killer"
and a dancing lunatic

52:06.861 --> 52:08.663
in a slaughterhouse is plenty.

52:09.897 --> 52:11.198
No more ideas from you.

52:16.004 --> 52:18.271
Remember what we talked about.

52:22.977 --> 52:24.344
Hey, KT.

52:25.513 --> 52:27.782
What'd you guys talk about?

52:27.915 --> 52:29.851
It's none
of your business, Eric.

52:29.984 --> 52:32.687
- Everybody knows.
- Know what else everyone knows?

52:32.820 --> 52:34.454
Six inches is not a lot.

52:36.691 --> 52:40.662
Wait, it... That's not...?
That's not...? That's not a lot?

52:49.169 --> 52:50.705
We call them nanites.

52:52.472 --> 52:56.309
- Those are in my blood?
- No. They are your blood.

53:46.160 --> 53:49.429
Hey, uh, so...

53:49.564 --> 53:50.932
do you think I could get

53:51.065 --> 53:55.503
some kind of RST tech
installed on my body?

53:55.636 --> 53:58.873
Why? Is there a particular part
that needs augmentation?

53:59.006 --> 54:00.373
Hey, Eric.

54:05.546 --> 54:06.514
No, never mind.

54:08.850 --> 54:10.017
Okay.

54:10.151 --> 54:11.719
Let's go.

54:27.969 --> 54:29.336
Ready?

54:29.469 --> 54:30.805
- Ops ready.
- Comms ready.

54:30.938 --> 54:32.807
Nanite systems ready.

54:35.475 --> 54:36.644
Where are you going?

54:38.478 --> 54:40.181
Doc, how are you talking to me?

54:40.313 --> 54:43.117
Oh, my God, this guy.

54:43.251 --> 54:47.420
You have millions of wireless
microprocessors in your brain.

54:47.555 --> 54:51.058
- We need you to come back now.
- <i>I've got unfinished business.</i>

54:51.192 --> 54:52.994
Such a relentless dick.

54:57.064 --> 55:00.735
It's because he's relentless,
he would literally die for her.

55:00.868 --> 55:03.004
I don't imagine you've ever
cared for anybody that much.

55:04.872 --> 55:06.607
Burn.

55:06.741 --> 55:09.309
Would you please...?
Don't you have somewhere to be?

55:17.185 --> 55:18.719
We are your only business.

55:18.853 --> 55:22.190
- We're the only people you know.
- <i>That's what you told me.</i>

55:22.322 --> 55:25.793
<i>But I had a wife.
And he took her from me.</i>

55:25.927 --> 55:28.963
What are you talking about?
Who did?

55:29.096 --> 55:30.631
<i>Nick Baris.</i>

55:31.833 --> 55:34.702
Okay. I can see him.

55:49.817 --> 55:52.520
Hey, boss. Check this out.

55:52.653 --> 55:54.789
We traced the call
to Baris here two days ago.

55:54.922 --> 55:56.489
He hasn't moved since.

55:56.624 --> 55:57.758
And security?

55:57.892 --> 55:59.359
I hacked their camera feeds.

55:59.492 --> 56:01.829
The place is a fortress.
But if he finds a way in,

56:01.963 --> 56:04.732
the 18 men they have
ain't gonna stop him.

56:04.866 --> 56:06.701
Well, he wanted the tech
all to himself.

56:06.834 --> 56:08.736
Now it's coming right for him.

56:08.870 --> 56:11.404
- And what's our man found?
- Exactly what we want him to.

56:11.539 --> 56:14.308
Let me know when he's on
final approach, okay?

56:16.978 --> 56:18.512
<i>Pulling up satellite feed.</i>

56:23.084 --> 56:25.553
Acquiring surveillance target.

56:29.090 --> 56:31.092
He's approaching
Baris' compound.

56:31.225 --> 56:33.227
See if you can clear that up.

56:37.832 --> 56:39.533
He's at the gate now.

56:39.667 --> 56:41.401
- American?
- Yeah.

56:43.337 --> 56:44.605
Are you sure it's him?

56:44.739 --> 56:47.141
- Well, yeah, he...
- Never mind. Get Wigans.

56:47.275 --> 56:48.910
- Tell him to bring it.
- Got it.

56:49.043 --> 56:50.778
<i>Private property.</i>

56:50.912 --> 56:52.613
<i>I'm here to see Nick Baris.</i>

56:52.747 --> 56:54.447
<i>Nature of your business?</i>

56:54.582 --> 56:56.183
<i>Oh, I'm here to kill him.</i>

56:56.317 --> 56:58.019
- <i>Oh, shit!</i>
- <i>What the...?</i>

57:00.221 --> 57:01.856
Whoa!

57:01.989 --> 57:03.423
Multiple ballistic impacts.

57:03.557 --> 57:05.425
Abdominal
nanite clusters active.

57:05.559 --> 57:09.363
Uh, why is he down?
He only took, like, four rounds.

57:09.496 --> 57:10.865
Look.

57:11.933 --> 57:13.968
Hm. He's Trojan-horsing it.

57:14.101 --> 57:15.569
Pretty clever, actually.

57:22.810 --> 57:25.579
Why is it always
right when the food arrives?

57:25.713 --> 57:27.014
Baris' office. Now.

57:27.148 --> 57:28.582
Bring the case.

57:38.292 --> 57:40.027
Don't look at my ass.

57:40.161 --> 57:41.128
Don't.

57:42.462 --> 57:44.165
Time for a better view.

57:48.235 --> 57:50.004
Energy level's stable, and...

57:50.137 --> 57:52.039
- Okay, there's Baris.
- Yep.

57:54.976 --> 57:57.311
Whoa,
someone's been stress-eating.

57:57.445 --> 57:59.013
We've got him
in the cellar, boss.

57:59.146 --> 58:00.281
What took you so long?

58:00.414 --> 58:02.149
Just chatting about life.

58:06.486 --> 58:08.189
Oh, shit.

58:08.322 --> 58:11.459
- What? Who is that, Eric?
- He's a techie, just like me.

58:11.592 --> 58:12.793
Here she is.

58:14.428 --> 58:16.097
Okay, it's time.

58:16.230 --> 58:17.431
So he's an IT guy.

58:17.565 --> 58:19.266
We're not IT guys, man.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.168
He's the real deal.
He's a legend.

58:21.302 --> 58:23.037
- Yeah.
- He's the first guy to figure out

58:23.170 --> 58:24.872
a stable bidirectional
neural interface.

58:25.006 --> 58:27.308
He's so good, I used some
of his open-source code

58:27.441 --> 58:30.544
- in this program.
- Wait, you used open-source code

58:30.678 --> 58:32.646
in my billion-dollar prototype?

58:32.780 --> 58:35.149
- Jesus, Eric.
- He's really smart.

58:35.282 --> 58:37.351
If he's so smart,
what's he doing with Baris?

58:37.485 --> 58:40.354
And why didn't we hire him?

58:41.689 --> 58:43.524
We tried.

58:43.657 --> 58:46.060
You're absolutely sure
that's him, yeah?

58:46.193 --> 58:48.396
Because this little beauty
only works once,

58:48.529 --> 58:50.498
and I don't want it...
Uh-oh.

58:52.533 --> 58:54.702
Oh, shit!

58:54.835 --> 58:58.005
He just put a hole in his chest
with his hand. That is...

58:58.139 --> 59:00.074
Why didn't you leave him
at the gate?

59:00.207 --> 59:01.742
Wigans.

59:01.876 --> 59:03.512
It's him. Do it now.

59:03.644 --> 59:06.380
Now? You want me to do it now?
You should've told me that

59:06.515 --> 59:08.249
- five minutes ago.
- Yes, now.

59:09.683 --> 59:12.353
I'm seeing CNS trauma.

59:12.486 --> 59:14.388
Left lung is collapsing.

59:15.556 --> 59:17.391
Heart rate's at 143.

59:22.730 --> 59:24.265
Look, mate,
there's a laundry list

59:24.398 --> 59:26.767
of things I have to get done.

59:26.901 --> 59:28.602
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

59:28.736 --> 59:31.605
Can you find out, please?

59:31.739 --> 59:34.742
- I have to charge it, and...
- So charge it.

59:34.875 --> 59:37.478
Rerouting nanite power.

59:40.948 --> 59:42.950
Look how much this means to him.

59:43.084 --> 59:44.585
It's remarkable, isn't it?
His...

59:44.718 --> 59:46.921
His need to get even,
to get revenge.

59:49.790 --> 59:51.025
Do it. Make it work.

59:51.158 --> 59:54.295
- Do it now. Do it!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

59:54.428 --> 59:57.898
- What is that, Eric?
- Just give me one second.

59:59.066 --> 01:00:00.401
That. Put that on my screen.

01:00:02.103 --> 01:00:04.805
When it reaches 100 percent...

01:00:07.675 --> 01:00:09.910
Oh, that's not good.

01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:12.613
- That button right there.
- Which one? This one?

01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.281
Not that one. That one.

01:00:14.415 --> 01:00:15.716
- Get out!
- It's one of the two.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.084
Take him away!

01:00:17.218 --> 01:00:20.321
Get out!
Put him back in his box.

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:21.556
Bye.

01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:24.492
Close the door
and stand outside!

01:00:24.658 --> 01:00:26.627
Um, guys?

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.864
- That thing might be an EMP.
- What?

01:00:29.997 --> 01:00:31.932
An EMP, an electromagnetic
pulse. It'll...

01:00:32.066 --> 01:00:34.635
I know what an EMP is. What
the hell is it doing there?

01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:41.876
Shit. He planned this.
Switch me on.

01:00:42.009 --> 01:00:43.844
I need you to get out of there.

01:00:45.346 --> 01:00:46.981
All right, hurry up.

01:00:47.114 --> 01:00:48.482
Come on, come on, come on.

01:00:49.584 --> 01:00:50.951
I need you to get out of...

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:57.024
We have a prob... Can he hear me?

01:00:57.158 --> 01:00:59.460
- He's muting you.
- How is he muting me?

01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:04.465
Come on, come on.
Wigans, you piece of shit!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.201
If that goes off,

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:09.303
we're screwed.
Eric, fix this, please.

01:01:09.436 --> 01:01:10.938
I don't know
how he's doing this.

01:01:11.071 --> 01:01:12.806
Something's intercepting
our signal.

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:22.049
You murdered my wife.

01:01:27.688 --> 01:01:30.525
Your wife?
What are you even talking about?

01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:33.894
They're lying to you.
You understand?

01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:37.932
I told you I'd find you.

01:01:41.035 --> 01:01:43.003
Okay, that solves that.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.525
Shit. Okay, we've lost picture.
Who the hell pushed that button?

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:13.535
- Now we've lost his signal.
- Come on.

01:02:13.668 --> 01:02:15.670
- Where's the signal?
- One sec.

01:02:15.803 --> 01:02:18.339
Switching to satellite.
Uh, what?

01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:20.542
Can you get something
on the screen, please?

01:02:20.675 --> 01:02:22.409
I've got nothing
on the screen, Eric.

01:02:22.544 --> 01:02:23.777
There's no signal.

01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:26.013
Not a light on for miles.
Eric,

01:02:26.146 --> 01:02:27.047
I have nothing!

01:02:32.554 --> 01:02:34.589
<i>Husband.</i>

01:02:34.723 --> 01:02:35.823
- Ray.
- <i>Hello?</i>

01:02:35.956 --> 01:02:38.459
- Hello? You still with me?
- Wake up.

01:02:41.563 --> 01:02:43.598
Ray. No!

01:02:43.732 --> 01:02:46.934
Okay, perhaps
a bit more voltage, then.

01:02:50.037 --> 01:02:52.239
Now, believe me,
this is going to hurt you

01:02:52.373 --> 01:02:54.808
a lot more than it's gonna...
Ah, whatever.

01:03:05.953 --> 01:03:07.921
No, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm a friendly.

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.591
I'm a friendly.
I'm on your side.

01:03:09.724 --> 01:03:11.392
I'm on your side. Yeah.

01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:13.093
Yeah. Look.

01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:15.062
Look at me letting you go.

01:03:15.195 --> 01:03:17.264
Look at that. Freedom.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.938
And Wigans said,
"Let there be light,"

01:03:25.072 --> 01:03:27.642
and there was light.
Look at that.

01:03:27.776 --> 01:03:30.911
Whoo! Still warm.

01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:33.147
Who the hell are you?

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.718
Mm! Goodness gracious,
how rude of me.

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:38.285
The name's Wilfred Wigans.

01:03:38.419 --> 01:03:40.854
I know.
Bit of a superhero-type name.

01:03:40.988 --> 01:03:43.290
Heh, heh. And I suppose
my superpower could be...

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:45.459
...coding.

01:03:45.593 --> 01:03:46.960
You work for Baris?

01:03:48.095 --> 01:03:49.731
Oh, yeah, no.

01:03:49.863 --> 01:03:51.899
Listen, define "work for."

01:03:52.032 --> 01:03:55.402
It's more like
indentured servitude, heh.

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:57.572
I've been looking
for a way out of here.

01:03:57.706 --> 01:03:59.708
I really have.
And I tried up there.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.375
There's a guy
with a gun up there.

01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:02.910
I'm sure you killed him,
right?

01:04:03.043 --> 01:04:06.046
You're like a knight
in shining armor. Yeah.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.283
Except for you don't really wear
any armor, now, do you?

01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:13.053
You sort of, like, let yourself
get shot, like, a lot.

01:04:13.187 --> 01:04:16.390
Because that's tough to watch,
actually. It's rough stuff.

01:04:16.524 --> 01:04:19.527
Particularly the part
where they walked up to you

01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:21.629
and, boom, clipped you
right in your head,

01:04:21.763 --> 01:04:24.699
and then your brains
just, pfft...

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:27.901
all over the floor.
Wicked, man. Wicked.

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:30.204
I feel like I died.

01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:32.574
My apologies.
I am terribly sorry about that.

01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:35.075
You know, Baris wanted me
to take you out,

01:04:35.209 --> 01:04:36.745
but I had plans of my own.

01:04:36.877 --> 01:04:40.114
I waited until you did your...

01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:42.883
business, which you
most certainly did.

01:04:43.016 --> 01:04:45.285
Now I'm done
with that bloody piece of shit

01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:48.021
telling me what to do
and how to do it.

01:04:51.358 --> 01:04:52.393
<i>You all right?</i>

01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:56.196
Thanks for the advice.

01:04:58.733 --> 01:04:59.868
Are you all right?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.035
I saw my wife in a dream.

01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:06.039
Well, good.

01:05:06.173 --> 01:05:09.042
I saw her murdered
right in front of me.

01:05:09.176 --> 01:05:12.246
Each time, the murderer was...

01:05:12.379 --> 01:05:13.882
a different person.

01:05:16.851 --> 01:05:18.285
Holy shit.

01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:20.522
So that's how they did it.

01:05:22.055 --> 01:05:22.956
Did what?

01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:28.596
Okay, okay, um...

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:30.931
I heard them talking.

01:05:31.064 --> 01:05:34.368
There have been these rumors
of a hired killer wiping out

01:05:34.502 --> 01:05:36.203
every defector of RST.

01:05:36.336 --> 01:05:38.472
Baris worked for RST?

01:05:38.606 --> 01:05:40.642
Well, they all did.

01:05:40.775 --> 01:05:44.445
And no one could figure out why
each kill was like a vendetta.

01:05:44.579 --> 01:05:47.014
You know, like it was
really, really personal.

01:05:47.147 --> 01:05:49.082
They filled my head
with nightmares

01:05:49.216 --> 01:05:51.485
and sent me
on a suicide mission.

01:05:51.619 --> 01:05:53.153
Yeah, it certainly seems
that way.

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:57.157
I mean, they've been
clearly manipulating you.

01:05:57.291 --> 01:06:00.127
It's likely
that what you think is real...

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.863
sometimes ain't.

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:06.668
Harting just used me.

01:06:08.302 --> 01:06:10.672
Just lied to my face
over and over again.

01:06:10.805 --> 01:06:13.340
Yeah. He seems to be
remarkably convincing.

01:06:13.474 --> 01:06:15.777
Told me my wife...

01:06:20.047 --> 01:06:21.315
Gina.

01:06:22.416 --> 01:06:24.485
I never even looked for her.

01:06:26.487 --> 01:06:28.656
But what if...?

01:06:30.825 --> 01:06:32.459
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look,

01:06:32.594 --> 01:06:34.662
they're not gonna
just let you walk away.

01:06:34.796 --> 01:06:36.965
They'll come for you.
They'll come for me too.

01:06:37.097 --> 01:06:40.467
- I'm looking forward to it.
- I'm not.

01:06:40.602 --> 01:06:42.804
Why do you think I went
biblical and brought you back?

01:06:42.937 --> 01:06:44.037
Think I'm running around,

01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.340
resurrecting people
from the dead?

01:06:46.473 --> 01:06:47.909
If they plug you back in,

01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.677
it's going to be me in your head

01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.913
killing that lovely wife
of yours.

01:06:52.045 --> 01:06:54.381
And I've seen what you've done
to those people.

01:06:57.117 --> 01:06:59.486
Just gonna walk away
from me, innit?

01:07:03.223 --> 01:07:05.827
My God, what are you...?
What are you doing?

01:07:12.667 --> 01:07:15.235
You could figure out
how these work.

01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:16.871
So just reverse engineer

01:07:17.005 --> 01:07:18.573
the work
of dozens of scientists,

01:07:18.706 --> 01:07:21.375
billions of dollars
and a decade of genetic coding?

01:07:21.509 --> 01:07:23.545
Well, that's your superpower.

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:27.247
I mean, yeah,
I'll be done by dinner,

01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:29.851
so it's not a big deal.

01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:32.720
That is absolutely amazing.

01:07:32.854 --> 01:07:34.822
You know,
I've heard the stories,

01:07:34.956 --> 01:07:37.859
but your entire system
is completely programmable.

01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:40.895
A program
they no longer control.

01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:45.132
It's my army now.

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:48.101
And your job
to keep it that way.

01:07:50.672 --> 01:07:54.042
Okay. I believe the words
you were searching for were:

01:07:54.174 --> 01:07:55.977
"Thank you, Wigans.

01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:57.946
Thank you for resurrecting me
from the dead."

01:07:58.078 --> 01:08:00.447
Wait.
I've got something for you.

01:08:00.582 --> 01:08:03.751
It should be right here
in my trusty lead-lined fridge.

01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:06.554
Oh, I am so clever.
I don't want that.

01:08:06.688 --> 01:08:09.289
Right. Oh, here it is. Bingo.

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:14.596
No! No! Not that one.
That won't work.

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:17.732
Trust me. Here, follow me.
And take this.

01:08:17.865 --> 01:08:20.200
I don't need it. The nanites
will connect me to the Web.

01:08:20.334 --> 01:08:22.770
No, the nanites will connect you
to an RST server.

01:08:22.904 --> 01:08:25.073
They can track you that way,
fill your head with bullshit.

01:08:25.205 --> 01:08:27.075
You don't want that.
Here, take it.

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:29.743
It'll connect you
directly to a satellite.

01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:32.647
Vintage. No electronic parts.

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:34.381
Thank you, Wigans.

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:04.045
We've got movement.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:07.948
Is it him?

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:09.383
I mean, it has to be.

01:09:09.517 --> 01:09:11.151
We still have no connection?

01:09:11.283 --> 01:09:13.286
The network's
still not responding.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.823
Okay, well, get
Tibbs and Dalton there now.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.095
<i>You guys are a go.</i>

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:23.965
- Let's roll.
- <i>We've only got</i>

01:09:24.098 --> 01:09:26.299
<i>satellite tracking on him,
so reel him in fast</i>

01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:28.201
<i>before we lose visual.</i>

01:09:29.737 --> 01:09:33.808
- Now, remember, he's one of us.
- He was.

01:09:33.941 --> 01:09:35.207
Now he's a problem.

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:41.348
Relax.

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:44.184
Now we finally get
to use all this shit.

01:10:15.917 --> 01:10:17.451
Ray?

01:10:19.654 --> 01:10:20.722
Gina.

01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:25.425
What are you doing here? Hm?

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.828
Hey.

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.495
Heh, you'll never believe

01:10:28.629 --> 01:10:30.765
- what I just went through.
- Well, knowing you,

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:33.601
it's classified, huh? Heh.

01:10:33.735 --> 01:10:35.203
This has been crazy.

01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.672
I mean...

01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:39.272
I can't even...

01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:41.876
That doesn't matter.

01:10:44.746 --> 01:10:46.246
Because I'm home.

01:10:47.715 --> 01:10:48.616
Home?

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.321
Yeah.

01:10:55.857 --> 01:10:57.125
I came back home.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:00.293
Ray, come on.

01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:01.996
I've moved on.

01:11:03.631 --> 01:11:06.433
Moved on?
What are you talking about?

01:11:06.567 --> 01:11:08.169
We settled this.

01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:10.403
Ray, are you okay?

01:11:10.538 --> 01:11:12.439
What...? I mean, what's going on?

01:11:12.573 --> 01:11:16.443
I came home
as I promised, didn't I?

01:11:16.577 --> 01:11:18.311
I always come home.

01:11:18.445 --> 01:11:21.582
Yes, I know, but I didn't
want you to come home.

01:11:21.716 --> 01:11:24.051
I wanted you to stay home.

01:11:24.185 --> 01:11:25.720
- Remember?
- Mommy.

01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:31.424
Daisy.

01:11:32.727 --> 01:11:34.262
Daisy, go back inside, darling.

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:44.471
Ray, I have a family now.

01:11:47.809 --> 01:11:51.179
When's the last time you saw me?

01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:55.049
I don't know.
It's been a long time.

01:11:55.183 --> 01:11:57.118
When was it, Gina?

01:11:58.451 --> 01:11:59.687
Five years ago.

01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.956
Five years?

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:05.893
- Mommy.
- One... One minute.

01:12:06.027 --> 01:12:08.296
- Are you okay, Ray? Can I...?
- Mommy, come and play.

01:12:08.428 --> 01:12:10.531
One... Can I call someone?

01:12:10.665 --> 01:12:12.567
- Mommy!
- Ray...

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.969
Daisy, go and play
with your brother. Good girl.

01:12:15.102 --> 01:12:16.904
Go find Daddy.

01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:31.484
<i>You think someday
you could come back</i>

01:12:31.619 --> 01:12:33.554
<i>in the same shape you left?</i>

01:12:35.923 --> 01:12:37.525
<i>They all end the same.</i>

01:12:37.658 --> 01:12:39.861
- <i>Ray.</i>
- <i>I always come home.</i>

01:12:39.994 --> 01:12:41.629
<i>Ray.</i>

01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:02.283
How's that shit
feel, old man, huh?

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.305
Tibbs! Get a tracker on him!

01:13:24.437 --> 01:13:25.472
Coming up.

01:13:37.752 --> 01:13:39.086
Eyes are in the sky.

01:13:48.162 --> 01:13:49.697
There he is.

01:13:51.365 --> 01:13:52.366
On my way.

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:11.585
Tibbs! I can't see him!

01:14:14.255 --> 01:14:16.624
<i>On the run, two blocks west.</i>

01:14:49.724 --> 01:14:52.126
- Hey, whoa, whoa, mate! Hey.
- Get back!

01:14:52.259 --> 01:14:53.361
Hey!

01:15:03.604 --> 01:15:05.306
- You're kidding me!
- Aah!

01:15:05.439 --> 01:15:06.374
What the...?

01:15:18.619 --> 01:15:20.221
<i>I've still got him.
Head south.</i>

01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:21.489
<i>South?</i>

01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:23.724
- Jesus, man, right or left?
- Left.

01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:26.427
<i>Left again. Move, move!</i>

01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:28.062
<i>You'll get him at the corner.</i>

01:15:36.037 --> 01:15:37.304
Dalton, look out!

01:15:37.438 --> 01:15:38.672
Come on! Stop!

01:15:47.815 --> 01:15:50.184
Bloody hell, mate. You okay?

01:15:50.317 --> 01:15:53.254
I'm not sure you should be
getting up. Maybe we can...

01:15:56.957 --> 01:15:58.192
Shit.

01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:15.910
Tagged him. Jackknives are in.

01:16:16.043 --> 01:16:17.311
Connection's reestablishing.

01:16:17.445 --> 01:16:21.649
You'll have signal
in three, two, one.

01:16:21.782 --> 01:16:23.417
All right, shut him down.

01:16:27.254 --> 01:16:28.722
Done.

01:16:28.856 --> 01:16:30.191
Power systems online.

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.093
Full control established.

01:16:32.226 --> 01:16:33.894
All right. Where are you going?

01:16:34.028 --> 01:16:36.363
- You know where.
- No chance. I need you on Wigans.

01:16:36.497 --> 01:16:38.632
- Wigans?
- He clearly knows too much.

01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:40.868
- I need him out of the picture.
- No.

01:16:41.001 --> 01:16:43.237
You get your hands dirty
this time.

01:16:56.016 --> 01:16:58.786
You'll remember
that I don't need to ask you.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.422
I do it out of respect.

01:17:05.092 --> 01:17:07.161
And that respect needs
to be reciprocated.

01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:18.672
Good girl.

01:17:38.926 --> 01:17:41.695
<i>Wigans has
been holed up at the Monteverde.</i>

01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:45.166
<i>He's ordered $812
of room service</i>

01:17:45.299 --> 01:17:48.335
<i>and has watched 17 hours</i>
<i>of something called</i> Ladies...

01:17:48.469 --> 01:17:50.738
- Not helpful, Eric.
- <i>Sorry, yeah. Okay.</i>

01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:53.073
<i>He's got
a six-man security detail,</i>

01:17:53.207 --> 01:17:55.376
<i>four in the cars
and two escorting him</i>

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:57.344
<i>out the back entrance.</i>

01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:12.493
Excuse me.
Do you have a lighter?

01:18:12.627 --> 01:18:15.129
Sir,
we should really get you in the car.

01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:18.399
A gentleman abides.

01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:20.301
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:29.243
The name's Wigans.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.581
Wilfred...

01:18:35.282 --> 01:18:36.750
Yeah.

01:18:39.486 --> 01:18:41.656
It's not good for you.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.563
Garrison.

01:19:21.696 --> 01:19:23.297
Garrison.

01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:26.934
You.

01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:30.838
What is this place?

01:19:30.971 --> 01:19:33.240
This is a neural space,

01:19:33.374 --> 01:19:36.076
where we can talk in private.

01:19:37.378 --> 01:19:39.146
Let me make this easier.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.316
This is all for you.

01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:19.420
You used me.

01:20:20.555 --> 01:20:21.488
You made me kill.

01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:22.923
I didn't make you kill, Ray.

01:20:23.057 --> 01:20:24.491
You've always done that.

01:20:24.626 --> 01:20:27.161
I just cleared the path.
I freed you to be your best.

01:20:27.294 --> 01:20:29.531
- My best?!
- Yes.

01:20:29.664 --> 01:20:31.932
By making me watch them
kill my wife

01:20:32.066 --> 01:20:34.168
over and over and over again?

01:20:34.301 --> 01:20:38.606
Revenge is what makes
a man like you exceptional, Ray.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.675
You know nothing
about men like me!

01:20:40.809 --> 01:20:42.677
You sure about that?

01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:47.314
You chose war because
you love it. That's who you are.

01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:49.383
You don't know what I love.

01:20:50.752 --> 01:20:53.454
Or why I did what I did.

01:20:53.588 --> 01:20:56.990
People like you break people
like me into pieces.

01:20:57.124 --> 01:20:58.859
And you put us
into these little boxes

01:20:58.992 --> 01:21:01.395
so you can understand us
and you can control us.

01:21:01.529 --> 01:21:02.831
But you can't control us.

01:21:02.963 --> 01:21:04.666
People like boxes, Ray.

01:21:04.799 --> 01:21:06.634
They need structure.
They need guidance.

01:21:06.768 --> 01:21:08.636
That's just a reality.

01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:12.039
Says the man who puts
the shadows on the wall.

01:21:14.274 --> 01:21:17.010
There's nothing left
for you out there.

01:21:17.144 --> 01:21:21.048
Nothing. In here, you get to be
the best version of yourself.

01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:23.083
You rescue the hostage.

01:21:23.217 --> 01:21:26.086
You get to spend the night
with a woman who loves you.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.589
And you wake up in the morning

01:21:27.722 --> 01:21:29.858
with a new body
and a defined purpose.

01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:31.693
What more could you ask for?

01:21:31.826 --> 01:21:33.728
Your best version of me!

01:21:33.862 --> 01:21:35.630
Not mine!

01:21:38.065 --> 01:21:40.200
Don't you get it?

01:21:41.703 --> 01:21:44.271
Life is about
not knowing what's coming.

01:21:44.405 --> 01:21:47.040
What, like when
it's taken away from you?

01:21:47.174 --> 01:21:49.577
Not knowing when it's gonna be
taken away from you,

01:21:49.711 --> 01:21:51.278
is that what you mean, Ray?

01:21:54.348 --> 01:21:56.483
You did this to me.

01:21:56.618 --> 01:21:59.086
You made me.

01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:01.723
But you can't
control me forever.

01:22:01.856 --> 01:22:04.826
I will find you,
and I will end...

01:22:06.694 --> 01:22:07.595
No, you won't.

01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:26.648
Just in time to say goodbye.

01:22:30.919 --> 01:22:32.486
He's back?

01:22:33.588 --> 01:22:35.155
For the time being.

01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:37.224
Harting's pulling the nanites?

01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:42.129
On the table now.

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:57.444
Show's about to start.

01:23:08.288 --> 01:23:09.256
Wigans got away.

01:23:09.389 --> 01:23:11.593
- What?
- He knew I was coming.

01:23:11.726 --> 01:23:14.596
Eric was sloppy
tracking him down.

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:18.800
Okay, stop the extraction.

01:23:18.933 --> 01:23:22.504
Prep the sim. Rebuild
the target package for Wigans.

01:23:29.042 --> 01:23:31.011
- One more run.
- Again?

01:23:32.547 --> 01:23:34.381
Yes, again.

01:23:34.516 --> 01:23:36.651
I wouldn't have
to send him after Wigans

01:23:36.784 --> 01:23:38.385
if you had done your job.

01:23:45.527 --> 01:23:47.094
Do it quickly.

01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:57.404
Okay, start the sequence.
We'll alter it real-time.

01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:05.947
<i>No sign
of alpha target. Moving location.</i>

01:24:27.635 --> 01:24:30.203
Okay. That should do it.

01:24:30.337 --> 01:24:31.873
It's not my best work, but...

01:24:32.006 --> 01:24:33.875
Is it ever?

01:24:42.584 --> 01:24:43.518
Ray?

01:24:46.253 --> 01:24:48.590
He's peaking way too early.
Why is that?

01:24:48.723 --> 01:24:52.192
Whoa, whoa, whoa. His vitals
are all over the place.

01:24:53.928 --> 01:24:55.262
Pull... Pull that up.

01:24:55.395 --> 01:24:57.765
Why is this happening?

01:24:57.899 --> 01:24:59.466
Someone's altering the sim.

01:24:59.601 --> 01:25:01.736
Well, who is altering it?!

01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:07.207
KT.

01:25:07.341 --> 01:25:09.242
Call Tibbs and Dalton
to command.

01:25:09.376 --> 01:25:10.979
Armed. And fix that sim!

01:25:16.249 --> 01:25:18.620
All right, I got this,
I got this. Come on.

01:25:21.089 --> 01:25:22.489
I know you.

01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:25.026
KT.

01:25:26.794 --> 01:25:28.663
KT, open the door.

01:25:28.796 --> 01:25:32.533
KT, what are you doing here?

01:25:32.667 --> 01:25:35.268
What I should have done
a long time ago.

01:25:45.278 --> 01:25:48.315
I'm in. I'm in.

01:25:49.684 --> 01:25:51.786
Son of a virgin.

01:25:53.253 --> 01:25:54.522
Okay.

01:26:01.495 --> 01:26:05.667
Heh, you thought you could lock
old Wigans out of his own code?

01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:17.912
- Wait. Wait, what?
- What the hell is happening?

01:26:18.046 --> 01:26:19.013
No, no, no.

01:26:20.982 --> 01:26:23.417
How...? How is she doing this?

01:26:26.654 --> 01:26:28.321
What? Ha!

01:26:28.455 --> 01:26:30.390
- I said, drop your gun!
- You got this.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.564
Okay, my son, if you're gonna
come for the king,

01:26:36.698 --> 01:26:39.801
you'd best not miss.

01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:41.903
KT! Open this goddamn door!

01:26:42.036 --> 01:26:45.006
That should do it.

01:26:52.345 --> 01:26:54.582
Um, okay.

01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:04.324
Oh, Jesus.

01:27:20.041 --> 01:27:21.175
Oh, Jesus.

01:27:22.342 --> 01:27:23.443
Twenty quid he just said,

01:27:23.578 --> 01:27:26.914
"Oh, Jesus." Twenty quid...

01:27:27.048 --> 01:27:29.751
I need real friends!
Or a therapist.

01:27:39.227 --> 01:27:40.327
Why are you doing this?

01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:43.064
Because he deserves the truth.

01:27:43.197 --> 01:27:46.234
The truth is, nobody wants
to make real decisions anymore.

01:27:50.772 --> 01:27:53.340
They just wanna
feel like they have.

01:27:55.943 --> 01:27:57.745
Goodbye, KT.

01:27:59.147 --> 01:28:01.481
Like I would let you
do that again.

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:19.133
<i>KT's gone rogue.
Garrison is awake and offline.</i>

01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:21.702
<i>Find him and shut him down.
Kill him if you have to.</i>

01:29:01.676 --> 01:29:03.311
Headed to the 74th floor.

01:29:04.979 --> 01:29:07.181
<i>Morning, sunshine. Remember me?</i>

01:29:07.315 --> 01:29:08.649
Wigans.

01:29:08.783 --> 01:29:10.350
"No, it is I,

01:29:10.483 --> 01:29:12.186
King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda."

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.855
Of course it's Wigans.

01:29:13.988 --> 01:29:15.890
Who else would it be?
Listen, mate, uh...

01:29:16.023 --> 01:29:18.626
I'm sending you coordinates
to my van.

01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:21.394
I realize that sounded
a lot creepier than I meant it.

01:29:21.529 --> 01:29:23.231
I've got unfinished business.

01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:25.533
Oh, great.

01:29:25.666 --> 01:29:28.803
- Wait. Come again.
- <i>Wigans, where's Garrison?</i>

01:29:28.936 --> 01:29:31.471
Uh, I don't know. Apparently,
doing whatever he wants.

01:29:31.606 --> 01:29:35.076
<i>It's about time. Phase two.
Coming up on the server room.</i>

01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:37.078
Okay, there you are.

01:29:38.846 --> 01:29:40.447
Which means it's time for me

01:29:40.581 --> 01:29:43.017
to walk you through
a low-level data erase.

01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:46.520
Now, obviously, I've got about
1000 years of coding experience.

01:29:46.654 --> 01:29:49.257
<i>I'm literally a genius.
You're so very welcome.</i>

01:29:49.389 --> 01:29:52.059
So it is vital you do exactly
what it is I tell you.

01:29:52.193 --> 01:29:54.362
<i>Step one.
Find the sysop terminal.</i>

01:29:54.528 --> 01:29:56.429
<i>It should be somewhere near...</i>

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:42.276
Step 36.
This one is absolutely vital.

01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:44.477
Type control, command...

01:30:48.182 --> 01:30:49.083
What the...?

01:30:53.254 --> 01:30:55.222
I thought I'd do it
the old-fashioned way.

01:30:55.356 --> 01:30:56.891
Oh, really?

01:30:57.024 --> 01:31:00.895
It's good to know literally
no one is listening to me.

01:31:01.028 --> 01:31:02.830
Why didn't I think of that?

01:31:02.964 --> 01:31:05.566
Control, command,
"burn the building down."

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.901
Kobe!

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.527
Yeah.

01:31:33.661 --> 01:31:35.663
That one was my idea.

01:32:24.211 --> 01:32:26.380
Right behind you. Dropping in!

01:32:53.074 --> 01:32:55.076
On my way. Keep him busy!

01:33:01.849 --> 01:33:03.084
Let it go, Tibbs.

01:33:03.217 --> 01:33:05.419
I'll be on you in three, two...

01:33:05.554 --> 01:33:07.121
Get clear!

01:33:15.129 --> 01:33:17.198
Let's see him survive that.

01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:25.639
Oh, goddamn it.
This guy just won't fucking die.

01:33:39.453 --> 01:33:40.988
Hang on, Tibbs!

01:33:43.958 --> 01:33:45.326
No!

01:34:16.924 --> 01:34:19.059
Dalton!
What are you doing? Help me!

01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:21.729
Dalton!

01:34:26.433 --> 01:34:28.302
I did say hang on!

01:35:27.728 --> 01:35:29.763
No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, shit.

01:35:32.333 --> 01:35:35.503
- Oh, that's not good.
- <i>What the hell was that?</i>

01:35:35.637 --> 01:35:37.838
- It felt like a bomb went off.
- Oh, bloody hell.

01:35:37.972 --> 01:35:41.108
Yeah. It's a... It's a problem.

01:35:41.242 --> 01:35:44.713
Go. Go, go, go. Come on.
Start the car. We're leaving.

01:35:45.913 --> 01:35:47.915
Harting!

01:35:51.018 --> 01:35:52.453
Goddamn it.

01:35:57.925 --> 01:35:59.628
Talk to me, Wigans.
Where's Garrison?

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:03.397
Uh, hang on. Ground floor,
east side, headed for Harting.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.801
You just don't get it, do you?

01:36:07.935 --> 01:36:09.436
I can rebuild all of this.

01:36:12.574 --> 01:36:15.142
And I am the only one
who can rebuild you.

01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:18.812
You cannot survive without me.

01:36:41.835 --> 01:36:43.270
Okay, fine.

01:36:51.979 --> 01:36:54.081
Holy shit. Oh, no.

01:36:54.214 --> 01:36:56.850
Bloody hell. Um, um, um, mate?

01:36:56.984 --> 01:36:58.753
What are you doing?
You have to stop.

01:37:12.966 --> 01:37:14.935
KT, he's almost down to nothing.

01:37:15.069 --> 01:37:17.772
- That's impossible.
- <i>He's overclocking the nanites.</i>

01:37:17.905 --> 01:37:21.643
If he doesn't stop, I won't
be able to bring him back.

01:37:21.776 --> 01:37:23.177
Shit!

01:37:39.627 --> 01:37:41.495
Don't make me do this.

01:37:58.145 --> 01:38:00.682
I told you I'd find you.

01:38:04.652 --> 01:38:07.622
Oh, man. He's done.

01:38:07.756 --> 01:38:09.356
It's over, KT.

01:38:12.359 --> 01:38:13.595
Yes, you did.

01:38:13.728 --> 01:38:15.730
But all that's now left
is Ray Garrison.

01:38:16.997 --> 01:38:18.432
And that's enough.

01:38:40.454 --> 01:38:41.723
<i>How much longer, Wigans?</i>

01:38:41.856 --> 01:38:43.490
<i>Don't, don't, don't rush me.</i>

01:38:43.625 --> 01:38:46.059
- <i>Is this going to work?</i>
- <i>It always works.</i>

01:38:46.193 --> 01:38:47.829
<i>Well, it did last time.
All right,</i>

01:38:47.961 --> 01:38:50.598
<i>A over B reattached.
There we go.</i>

01:38:50.732 --> 01:38:52.966
<i>Should you be eating
while you're doing that?</i>

01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.068
<i>Yeah. There we go.</i>

01:38:55.202 --> 01:38:57.070
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
We've got you.</i>

01:38:58.573 --> 01:39:00.441
Are you all right?

01:39:01.543 --> 01:39:02.777
Are you with me?

01:39:05.279 --> 01:39:07.214
Take it easy.

01:39:07.347 --> 01:39:09.116
Where am I?

01:39:11.218 --> 01:39:12.386
Relax.

01:39:13.555 --> 01:39:16.123
Relax. Take it easy.

01:39:17.559 --> 01:39:20.294
No car batteries this time.

01:39:22.664 --> 01:39:25.098
It's good to see you, man.
How you feeling?

01:39:35.944 --> 01:39:37.946
It's good to see you, Wigans.

01:39:42.817 --> 01:39:44.786
You don't know
how glad I am to hear that.

01:39:44.919 --> 01:39:47.488
I wasn't sure
you'd remember anything.

01:39:47.622 --> 01:39:49.858
I thought you'd wake up
like a gorilla in a cage

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:53.628
and rip me apart.
That is absolutely fantastic.

01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:55.630
But what you probably
don't remember

01:39:55.763 --> 01:39:57.397
is that I also made
some adjustments

01:39:57.532 --> 01:39:59.466
to increase your stamina.

01:39:59.601 --> 01:40:02.504
You know, your stamina?
I don't know why I done that.

01:40:02.637 --> 01:40:05.507
But what I mean is, you don't
gotta keep refilling the tank.

01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.342
Not at all.
Get what I mean?

01:40:08.475 --> 01:40:10.545
If you were a three before,
you're now an 18.

01:40:10.678 --> 01:40:12.179
Heh, and I done that.

01:40:12.312 --> 01:40:15.182
Well, we did.

01:40:15.315 --> 01:40:16.718
We.

01:40:18.018 --> 01:40:19.721
We.

01:40:21.823 --> 01:40:25.760
Um, he's awake,
and he remembers everything.

01:40:25.894 --> 01:40:27.662
Hopefully not
everything-everything.

01:40:27.795 --> 01:40:31.064
You know, because if you recall,
KT, how we found him,

01:40:31.198 --> 01:40:33.433
his face was smooshed up
against his own...

01:40:36.838 --> 01:40:38.606
Thank you, Wigans.

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.741
Yeah.

01:40:42.911 --> 01:40:44.378
You're welcome.

01:40:53.688 --> 01:40:56.256
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:59.059
- It's like a dream.
- It is.

01:41:09.069 --> 01:41:11.039
- Ray, I...
- Don't.

01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:12.439
You don't have to.

01:41:14.008 --> 01:41:16.176
Who we were, what we did?

01:41:17.377 --> 01:41:19.881
That was the past.

01:41:20.014 --> 01:41:23.952
You know, Harting was wrong
about a lot of it, but, uh...

01:41:24.084 --> 01:41:25.620
he did get one thing right.

01:41:27.755 --> 01:41:30.758
Who we were doesn't have
to define who we're gonna be.

01:41:32.392 --> 01:41:34.896
We can choose. We all can.

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:20.173
So where to now?

01:42:20.307 --> 01:42:21.709
I have no idea.

01:42:24.112 --> 01:42:25.113
Perfect.

01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:32.854
<i>A little too
perfect, if you ask me.</i>

01:42:32.987 --> 01:42:34.822
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:42:34.956 --> 01:42:37.692
<i>Ride into the sunset? Are we
sure this ain't all a simu...?</i>
