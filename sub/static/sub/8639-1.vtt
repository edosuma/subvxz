01:04.911 --> 01:06.288
Let's go!

01:15.759 --> 01:16.687
Incoming!

01:19.503 --> 01:21.700
- Sorry, captain.
- It's all right, son.

01:21.744 --> 01:23.600
That's the future in your hands.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.536
Heave! Heave! Heave!

01:28.304 --> 01:30.704
- Starboard gunners ready, captain.
- Lieutenant.

01:34.992 --> 01:36.272
Fire!

01:40.112 --> 01:42.000
Prepare to take us into the channel.
Ahead a half.

01:42.224 --> 01:44.144
- Make revolutions for five knots.
- Aye, sir.

01:49.584 --> 01:53.392
- Range, 150 yards!
- 150 yards!

01:56.688 --> 01:58.192
Fire!

02:01.168 --> 02:02.160
Fire!

02:05.744 --> 02:06.768
Fire!

02:12.784 --> 02:14.320
- All ahead full.
- Aye, captain.

02:46.321 --> 02:47.473
Stop engines.

02:47.697 --> 02:49.648
- Captain?
- Stop engines! Run silent!

02:50.289 --> 02:51.472
Cease firing!

02:51.664 --> 02:55.153
Cease firing!
Close the gun ports. Hold still.

02:55.345 --> 02:57.424
- Cease firing!
- Close the gun ports!

07:24.660 --> 07:26.004
Mrs. Nwokolo?

07:26.196 --> 07:28.980
Eva Rojas, World Health Organization.
This is Dr. Hopper.

07:29.204 --> 07:31.092
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Please come with me.

07:35.732 --> 07:38.580
Sorry about the dark.
The light hurts his eyes.

07:38.804 --> 07:40.244
- Thank you.
- What's his name?

07:40.436 --> 07:42.581
Azikiwe. Most call him Kiwe.

07:42.773 --> 07:44.885
Hi, Kiwe. My name is Eva.

07:45.077 --> 07:47.444
We need to have a little look
at you, okay?

07:47.636 --> 07:49.493
- How long has he been sick?
- For two days.

07:49.685 --> 07:52.661
- Has he traveled anywhere recently?
- He was in Mali last week.

07:53.108 --> 07:54.324
With his father.

07:54.869 --> 07:57.557
- Where is his father now?
- He's at the lighthouse.

07:57.749 --> 07:58.933
That's where he works.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.533
Blood pressure, 80/50.

08:00.757 --> 08:02.804
- Circulatory failure.
- Drawing blood.

08:06.548 --> 08:08.917
- Easy, son. Easy. No, no.
- Kiwe!

08:09.109 --> 08:10.772
- Sedative, Eva.
- What dose?

08:10.964 --> 08:12.020
Two mils.

08:12.212 --> 08:14.549
Easy, son. Easy. No. It's okay.

08:14.741 --> 08:16.981
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
Just trying to help.

08:17.173 --> 08:18.997
It's okay. It's okay, Kiwe.

08:19.477 --> 08:20.852
It's okay.

08:21.205 --> 08:24.373
- Your mama... Your mama is here.
- It's okay, Kiwe. It's okay.

08:28.085 --> 08:29.301
You all right?

08:29.493 --> 08:32.373
- Mali, just like the others.
- Yeah, I know.

08:33.717 --> 08:36.020
- This is an outbreak, Frank.
- We've got six cases.

08:36.212 --> 08:38.421
- That's not enough.
- Oh, how many do we need?

08:38.613 --> 08:39.924
Sixty?

08:40.116 --> 08:41.717
Six thousand?

08:43.061 --> 08:45.013
When does it start to matter?

08:53.142 --> 08:55.317
We have to find the source, Frank.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.349
You wanna go to Mali.

08:59.637 --> 09:00.630
It's not gonna happen.

09:00.822 --> 09:04.629
WHO isn't gonna lose
any more staff to a civil war.

09:04.821 --> 09:08.181
- Here, finish your report.
- Good.

09:08.821 --> 09:10.869
- Just in time for the autopsy.
- Eva.

09:14.646 --> 09:16.405
I'll do what I can do.

09:17.142 --> 09:19.190
I'll re-present to the board.

09:19.382 --> 09:22.197
- And maybe they'll listen this time.
- Thank you.

09:23.478 --> 09:25.077
We still need blood samples
from his father.

09:25.269 --> 09:26.901
I'll find the father.

09:48.886 --> 09:50.198
Hello?

09:53.238 --> 09:54.998
Mr. Nwokolo?

10:04.694 --> 10:06.230
Mr. Nwokolo?

10:34.646 --> 10:36.055
Hey!

10:37.815 --> 10:38.998
Help.

10:50.199 --> 10:52.567
You have no business being here.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.719
Quick, get her bag.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.887
Are you okay?

11:59.512 --> 12:02.231
Hey! Hey, pick that up!

12:02.423 --> 12:04.696
What are you doing? Come on.

12:04.888 --> 12:07.991
You're walking past...
All right, guys. Come on.

12:08.183 --> 12:11.224
Guys, quit screwing around.

12:11.512 --> 12:15.544
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on. All right, stop.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.176
All right, hold it there.

12:17.399 --> 12:19.448
Report any variances over two feet.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.720
Here, hold on to these.
Come on, grab it.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.720
All right. Come on, you piece of...

12:30.232 --> 12:32.568
All right, give me a wrench.
I need the wrench.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.200
Wrench! Anybody there?

12:37.112 --> 12:41.720
All right, oil. I need the oil.
All right, the oil. Thank you.

12:43.768 --> 12:47.608
That's it. All right, we're good!
We're good!

12:48.280 --> 12:49.528
Sorry.

12:49.752 --> 12:52.504
Here. Hi.

12:52.696 --> 12:54.232
- Al Giordino.
- Eva.

12:54.456 --> 12:56.217
- Eva Rojas.
- Nice work.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.753
- Thanks.
- Welcome aboard.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.256
Thank you.

13:00.376 --> 13:04.920
All right, turn it on. Go down.
Go, go, go, go, go.

13:05.112 --> 13:07.257
More. Keep going.

13:07.896 --> 13:09.336
Hi.

13:09.528 --> 13:11.224
- How are you? Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.568
- I'm Rudi.
- Sorry, where are we?

13:12.760 --> 13:15.576
This is the Martha Ann,
It's a NUMA boat. Ship.

13:15.768 --> 13:18.329
We didn't know who you were, so
we kind of patched you up ourselves.

13:18.521 --> 13:20.217
You had an edema
of the upper tracheal track.

13:20.409 --> 13:23.160
Rudi, I've been waiting
two months for this moment.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.272
Don't mess it up for me
by letting him drown.

13:25.497 --> 13:27.672
- Yes, admiral.
- Diver up!

13:27.864 --> 13:32.664
In five, counting,
four, three, two, one.

13:45.401 --> 13:47.961
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce to you

13:48.153 --> 13:52.249
after a 772-year engagement
on the bottom of the ocean:

13:52.441 --> 13:55.161
King Bateen!

13:58.489 --> 14:00.217
Nice job, everyone.

14:01.177 --> 14:02.713
Except you, Al. What the hell?

14:02.905 --> 14:05.977
It's a 10-ton-rated winch,
my friend, not a fly-fishing rod.

14:06.169 --> 14:08.377
You know what? You're thinking
of the Thompson 12-91.

14:08.569 --> 14:10.618
Whereas you're astride a 12-93.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.018
- Not that you could operate either one.
- Boys!

14:13.210 --> 14:14.137
- Sir?
- Sir?

14:14.329 --> 14:16.858
The king meets the people
at the museum in five hours.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.937
- Don't worry, sir. He'll be there.
- He'll be there.

14:19.129 --> 14:20.057
He better be.

14:20.281 --> 14:21.817
Secure those cables!

14:22.937 --> 14:25.753
Hey, look who's on her feet.

14:25.978 --> 14:27.097
Thanks to you, I guess.

14:27.737 --> 14:30.778
You were lucky to just lose your bag.
Dangerous city.

14:31.001 --> 14:32.890
Damn it, I did lose my bag.

14:33.113 --> 14:36.538
- Nothing worth dying for, I hope.
- Well, that's a tough question.

14:37.018 --> 14:38.521
Nothing worth you dying for.

14:38.778 --> 14:39.930
Hey, Dirk, get your butt up here

14:40.122 --> 14:42.394
so we can scrape
some of the crap off this thing.

14:42.586 --> 14:44.185
- Excuse me. The wife.
- Come on, ladies,

14:44.377 --> 14:45.882
get Mr. Bateen unhooked.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.538
Clean him up.
We got a party to go to.

14:48.730 --> 14:50.490
- Admiral?
- Retired.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.474
- Jim Sandecker.
- Eva. Eva Rojas.

14:52.666 --> 14:54.618
I'm with the WHO.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.042
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee.

14:59.226 --> 15:01.050
- Hey, Dirk. Hey, I need your help.
- What?

15:01.242 --> 15:04.122
- Is it left over right, or right over left?
- This better not be like last time.

15:04.346 --> 15:06.234
I can't remember.
It's driving me nuts.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.882
Is there something about a rabbit
going around a tree or something?

15:10.074 --> 15:11.802
I'll be there in an hour.

15:12.698 --> 15:15.642
- What, Dirk?
- That was Oshodi.

15:16.634 --> 15:18.938
He thinks he might
have found something.

15:19.354 --> 15:22.170
Oh, that's great. That is fantastic.

15:22.362 --> 15:25.690
- Thank you very much.
- No, no, no, no, fantastic for me.

15:25.882 --> 15:30.362
I can't wait to tell Sandecker that you're
not gonna be at the museum tonight

15:30.587 --> 15:33.050
because one of your contacts
from the Nigerian underworld

15:33.275 --> 15:36.186
has found evidence of a Civil War
ironclad shipwrecked

15:36.410 --> 15:38.586
- In a storm off Africa. Yeah, right.
- Storm off Africa.

15:38.778 --> 15:42.203
That's what you're talking about, right?
Yeah. Sandecker's gonna freak.

15:42.395 --> 15:44.858
- Look, Al...
- And I'll be there. He'll turn all red.

15:45.050 --> 15:49.307
The fox chases the rabbit around
the tree and down the hole.

15:49.499 --> 15:52.922
That's how the tie works.
Don't you worry, I'll be there.

15:53.658 --> 15:56.891
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

15:57.115 --> 16:01.339
First, I'd like to thank the Lagos
museum for this magnificent reception.

16:01.562 --> 16:03.098
I would also like to thank

16:03.323 --> 16:06.811
our primary benefactor on this project,
Yves Massarde.

16:07.355 --> 16:09.019
Thank you.

16:12.410 --> 16:14.107
We are NUMA,

16:14.330 --> 16:17.339
the National Underwater
and Marine Agency.

16:17.531 --> 16:20.795
And this, ladies and gentlemen,
is what we do.

16:23.579 --> 16:25.083
King Bateen.

16:28.475 --> 16:29.979
- Where is he?
- He's not at the buffet.

16:30.171 --> 16:31.611
- Damn it.
- Do you want another kebab?

16:31.803 --> 16:34.843
With the help of museums,
with the help of governments,

16:35.067 --> 16:38.363
private organizations like ours
can work in partnership

16:38.555 --> 16:39.963
to make sure that history,

16:40.155 --> 16:42.939
history that has been lost
to the tides of time,

16:43.131 --> 16:46.363
can be returned to its people.
Thank you.

16:46.555 --> 16:48.763
Thank you so much.
Have a lovely evening.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.084
Do you have a CD burner
on that ship of yours?

16:57.276 --> 17:00.156
Yes, the same one I bought
from you last month.

17:01.083 --> 17:05.019
I have a wonderful piece, straight
from the Iraqi National Museum.

17:05.211 --> 17:07.994
Don't show me things like that,
Oshodi. We're not that friendly.

17:08.186 --> 17:12.060
Okay, okay. Now, here it is.

17:13.467 --> 17:17.883
A very special piece.
The one I spoke to you about.

17:18.588 --> 17:22.460
It breaks my heart
just to show it to you.

17:29.403 --> 17:31.068
Where did you get this?

17:31.260 --> 17:32.924
Cash, please.

17:34.107 --> 17:35.516
We are not that friendly.

17:52.156 --> 17:54.108
This is a great party.

17:56.060 --> 17:58.908
- Thank you for inviting us, admiral.
- The pleasure is mine.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.244
Yves, this is the woman
I was telling you about,

18:01.436 --> 18:03.068
- Dr. Eva Rojas.
- Hi.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.308
I'm delighted to make your
acquaintance. I'm Yves Massarde.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.292
Nice to meet you.
This is Dr. Frank Hopper.

18:07.484 --> 18:08.764
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

18:08.989 --> 18:11.197
Yves does a lot of business
in Africa.

18:12.028 --> 18:13.564
Some even in Mali.

18:14.908 --> 18:16.573
Will you excuse me?

18:17.116 --> 18:21.148
I understand you believe there is some
sort of plague coming out of Mali?

18:21.340 --> 18:22.909
We don't like to say "plague."

18:23.101 --> 18:24.892
- What do you think it is then?
- A plague.

18:25.597 --> 18:26.941
So you do business in Mali?

18:27.421 --> 18:29.245
Do you know anyone there
who could help us

18:29.437 --> 18:31.580
by pressuring the WHO
to send a team?

18:31.772 --> 18:34.461
Well, you see, much of Mali
is controlled by a warlord.

18:34.653 --> 18:36.477
General Kazim. Do you know him?

18:36.765 --> 18:39.196
Yes. He used to be a colonel
in the Malian army,

18:39.388 --> 18:41.469
and gave himself an upgrade
the day he shot the president.

18:41.692 --> 18:43.581
He's the man who put the "war"
back into "warlord."

18:43.804 --> 18:45.085
And he controls the country?

18:45.277 --> 18:46.972
Half of it. And the other half
no one controls,

18:47.164 --> 18:48.700
but I don't know which is worse.

18:48.925 --> 18:52.285
But I have to warn you, it is very
dangerous for foreigners right now.

18:52.477 --> 18:54.621
I would say it's probably
more dangerous for locals.

18:54.813 --> 18:58.300
Yes, but your death would
look very bad in the papers.

18:58.492 --> 19:00.221
So does the word "plague."

19:03.005 --> 19:06.461
All right, I will call some people,
but at the end of the day,

19:06.653 --> 19:09.693
I'm just a businessman,
so be patient.

19:09.885 --> 19:11.773
Oh, yeah, she's good at that.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.677
He's not gonna help us.
This was a waste of time.

19:15.869 --> 19:19.101
Eva, we can't just wander into
the middle of a Malian civil war.

19:19.293 --> 19:21.661
The fighting with the Tuaregs
is too severe. You know that.

19:21.885 --> 19:24.445
I think we should go back
to the hospital...

19:24.637 --> 19:27.325
Admiral, have you ever seen
a Confederate gold dollar?

19:27.517 --> 19:29.342
- Dear God, don't start this again.
- Of course not.

19:29.534 --> 19:30.974
The Confederacy never made
a gold dollar.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.702
The mint was destroyed
near the end of the war.

19:32.894 --> 19:34.718
Dirk, I beg you on my hands
and knees. Don't.

19:34.910 --> 19:38.429
But not before Jefferson Davis
had five samples made.

19:38.621 --> 19:41.277
He gave four of those samples
to his top generals:

19:41.469 --> 19:44.414
- Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Johnston.
- Every time we come to Africa,

19:44.606 --> 19:47.486
out comes that stupid ship model.
Out come the old port journals.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.821
We are leaving for Australia
tomorrow.

19:50.045 --> 19:51.581
Four of those samples
have been found.

19:52.061 --> 19:54.590
But the fifth never was.

19:54.782 --> 19:56.830
That one was given to
an old family friend of Davis.

19:57.022 --> 19:59.870
A brilliant young sea captain
named Mason Tombs.

20:00.062 --> 20:03.038
Captain of the CSS ironclad Texas.

20:05.501 --> 20:07.613
- Where in the hell did you get this?
- Frederick Oshodi.

20:07.805 --> 20:09.118
And he got it from a man
named Indigwe.

20:09.310 --> 20:12.574
But the important thing is that Indigwe
found this in Labbezanga, Mali.

20:12.766 --> 20:13.918
Hey, my dad collects coins.

20:14.110 --> 20:17.534
No, that coin and the Texas
were on the Niger River.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.094
It's impossible. An ironclad
couldn't make it with her draft.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.366
Let me take the Calliope
to Labbezanga, have a look around.

20:22.590 --> 20:24.734
- You can't have my boat, Dirk.
- Three days, admiral.

20:24.926 --> 20:27.038
Just three days. Imagine.

20:27.230 --> 20:28.542
Imagine.

20:32.158 --> 20:33.854
All right, if I strike out,

20:34.046 --> 20:36.254
you'll never hear another word
about this.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.542
You got 72 hours.

20:41.278 --> 20:42.622
And not a nanosecond more.

20:43.006 --> 20:45.054
You fellas just bought
yourself a boat trip.

20:45.438 --> 20:47.871
You're a gentleman, admiral.
I don't care what they say about you.

20:48.063 --> 20:50.494
I got a bottle says we never find it.

20:51.615 --> 20:54.910
- Make it a case.
- All right. You're on.

21:18.815 --> 21:20.511
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See you later.

21:21.471 --> 21:22.815
Hey, yo!

21:25.311 --> 21:27.006
- You're late.
- Excuse me?

21:27.198 --> 21:29.247
- I was told 8:00 departure.
- Eight o'clock?

21:29.439 --> 21:31.199
- I never said 8:00.
- I said 9.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.895
- Nine.
- It's after 1 0.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.206
Who said 8?

21:35.007 --> 21:36.063
Admiral Sandecker.

21:36.255 --> 21:38.334
Yeah, he said to give him a call
if you had any problems.

21:38.526 --> 21:40.287
A problem? With what?

21:40.895 --> 21:43.327
He wants you to take us
up the river to Mali.

21:43.519 --> 21:46.751
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:46.943 --> 21:49.919
- Taking you to Mali?
- Wait.

21:50.111 --> 21:51.807
There's been an outbreak in Mali.

21:51.999 --> 21:55.679
- It's going to become an epidemic.
- And you wanna hitch a ride, doctor?

21:56.319 --> 21:58.335
What, WHO's making
budgetary cutbacks?

21:58.559 --> 22:00.095
Please. It's important.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.615
- You guys got enough gear?
- Probably not.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.551
Small boat. No privacy.

22:12.095 --> 22:13.823
I'm not shy.

23:32.897 --> 23:34.241
Where do you call home?

23:34.433 --> 23:36.641
I have a house in Monterey,
but I'm never there.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.168
Monterey. There's great diving
in Monterey.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.568
Is that all you ever think about?
Diving?

23:41.760 --> 23:45.665
No. Sometimes I think about
Petricola pholadiformis.

23:46.944 --> 23:48.768
The angel wing clam.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.456
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

23:51.648 --> 23:53.888
This river's the only place
on earth they're found.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.712
When they're underwater,
they glow in the dark.

23:55.904 --> 23:58.529
Now, the amazing thing is that
modern science cannot explain why.

23:58.721 --> 24:00.128
There must be a reason.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.169
Till then, my theory is that
they do it because they can.

24:03.392 --> 24:05.696
Dirk! That's it. Let's go.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.873
Angel wings.

24:08.864 --> 24:12.128
World would be a lot cooler place
if more of us were like that, huh?

24:25.185 --> 24:28.193
This is the center of the cluster.
Here. Asselar.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.049
That's where we have to go.

24:30.529 --> 24:32.193
Right in the middle
of Kazim's civil war.

24:32.385 --> 24:34.753
Hey, you ever been
after marlins, doctors?

24:34.977 --> 24:37.057
Oh, no, not
the marlin story again, Al.

24:37.281 --> 24:39.649
Seven hundred
and thirty-three pounds.

24:39.841 --> 24:42.497
Five and a half hours
in the fighting chair.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.633
- I thought it was 600 pounds.
- Hey!

24:45.825 --> 24:49.410
What did you catch that day?
I can't remember anything at all.

24:49.602 --> 24:51.105
How long you guys been together?

24:51.297 --> 24:54.913
Oh, since kindergarten.
College. Navy. NUMA.

24:55.105 --> 24:57.345
Poor guy's always
been in my shadow.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.066
Always the Al's-maid, never the Al.

25:00.258 --> 25:01.921
Right?

25:05.922 --> 25:08.001
Nice, doc.

25:08.641 --> 25:09.889
You're pulling your weight.

25:11.874 --> 25:16.194
- My watch, chief.
- All right, my man. Excellent.

25:19.425 --> 25:24.225
Your friend Al told me all about
your Captain Tombs and his boat.

25:24.417 --> 25:26.018
Oh, he did, did he?

25:26.625 --> 25:29.666
He also said ironclads were
not made to cross the ocean.

25:29.858 --> 25:32.418
Well, neither was man. Tequila?

25:36.450 --> 25:37.986
And you found a coin?

25:41.314 --> 25:42.818
Not just a coin.

25:44.802 --> 25:46.690
I found the coin.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.698
Now, I also have a letter
from the captain's widow

25:49.890 --> 25:53.058
alluding to her husband's
urgent Eastern voyage.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.266
I have a sailor's log
on an Atlantic clipper

25:55.458 --> 25:58.082
who swears on a stack of Bibles
he saw a great iron beast

25:58.274 --> 26:00.642
steaming two miles
off the African coast.

26:01.762 --> 26:05.954
Now, what kind of man tries to take
a ship like that across the ocean?

26:07.459 --> 26:09.379
Why? How?

26:09.763 --> 26:11.330
I don't know.

26:11.554 --> 26:12.994
But I plan on finding out.

26:17.443 --> 26:20.834
Al loves it when people ask me that,
thinks it makes me look a bit:

26:30.626 --> 26:32.386
This must be nice.

26:33.507 --> 26:35.107
To have this as your office.

26:36.994 --> 26:38.755
Well, every great thing that's ever
happened to me

26:38.947 --> 26:40.450
happened in the water.

26:42.627 --> 26:44.355
Every one.

26:55.522 --> 26:57.795
Hey, Rudi, come on,
help me out with this.

26:58.307 --> 26:59.875
Oumar.

27:00.387 --> 27:02.115
- You got it?
- There you go.

27:02.307 --> 27:05.571
- How long to Asselar?
- Oh, six, eight hours. No problem.

27:05.763 --> 27:07.459
- You stay for long?
- No, not long.

27:07.651 --> 27:09.123
All right, this one too.

27:09.315 --> 27:11.779
- Think it'll be safe?
- Oh, it's okay.

27:11.971 --> 27:14.915
Where we go now,
no fighting. No problem.

27:15.139 --> 27:17.699
- Yeah, no problem.
- No Tuareg.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.539
Listen, I've been thinking.

27:21.763 --> 27:24.547
When this is over,
there's a place I know.

27:24.739 --> 27:26.595
It's called Monterey.

27:26.883 --> 27:28.931
- Never heard of it.
- No?

27:29.667 --> 27:31.203
It's got a beautiful beach.

27:31.395 --> 27:34.532
Golden sands, aqua-blue surf.
The place is paradise.

27:34.724 --> 27:36.099
- Sounds good.
- Oh, yeah.

27:36.963 --> 27:40.355
I also happen to know a woman
who has a house there.

27:40.547 --> 27:44.163
And because she's a workaholic,
she's never at home.

27:44.355 --> 27:47.235
Now, I haven't asked her, but I'm
pretty sure that she wouldn't mind

27:47.459 --> 27:48.515
if you dropped by.

27:48.963 --> 27:50.147
Can I bring a friend?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.284
You'd have to ask her.

27:53.476 --> 27:55.331
I already did.

27:56.195 --> 27:57.700
You did?

27:59.075 --> 28:01.187
You, me and the bay of Monterey.

28:03.044 --> 28:04.451
Thank you for everything.

28:04.708 --> 28:06.308
- You're welcome.
- And good luck to you.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.476
You as well. Bonne route, doctor.

28:26.276 --> 28:28.452
Mr. Indigwe, he lives...

28:32.164 --> 28:34.628
Indigwe. He find this
one week before, yes?

28:41.316 --> 28:45.093
You know, I'm not
too much of a linguist...

28:45.508 --> 28:47.205
...but that didn't sound too good.

28:47.716 --> 28:49.476
Indigwe is dead.

28:52.644 --> 28:54.532
Yeah. Hey, the check.

28:54.724 --> 28:57.093
What is "the check"? L'addition,

29:05.572 --> 29:07.749
Hey, you know, my dad
collected ancient coins.

29:07.941 --> 29:12.036
From Rome, China, Siam, Persia.

29:12.228 --> 29:15.396
Somehow they all ended up
in a shoebox in New Jersey.

29:16.932 --> 29:19.845
- Meaning?
- Coins travel, Dirk.

29:20.901 --> 29:24.197
Even if that poor guy was still alive,
it could have been nothing.

29:25.476 --> 29:28.356
Yeah, but the coin traveled
from somewhere, Al.

29:28.581 --> 29:30.756
And unless it hitched a ride
on the back of a dolphin,

29:30.948 --> 29:32.484
I'm gonna guess that
its jumping-off point

29:32.676 --> 29:34.917
was a little bit closer
to where we're sitting.

29:35.941 --> 29:40.613
Really, you can see that ironclad
steaming up the river? I mean, really?

29:40.805 --> 29:44.293
Isn't it more likely that we missed it
somewhere off the coast of Virginia?

29:46.021 --> 29:47.685
Right?

29:49.157 --> 29:50.629
Hello?

29:52.069 --> 29:53.445
Dirk.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.221
I'll meet you at the boat.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.205
No, I got the check.

30:03.397 --> 30:05.413
Don't worry about it. I'm serious.

30:05.605 --> 30:07.013
I know, I get it all the time.

30:07.205 --> 30:10.693
Sit down, I'll get the check.
L'addition,

31:03.366 --> 31:05.062
Ya-Sheikh.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.110
My name is Dirk.

31:09.062 --> 31:10.726
I'm looking for a boat.

31:13.318 --> 31:15.558
And when would we be
seeing this boat?

31:15.750 --> 31:19.814
About 140 years ago, in 1866.

31:20.006 --> 31:23.462
Back when Labbezanga was
one of the greatest ports in Africa.

31:23.654 --> 31:25.031
Do you know anything else?

31:25.223 --> 31:28.934
We use events to find dates,
not dates to find events.

31:29.735 --> 31:31.878
Well, there was a storm.

31:32.231 --> 31:33.894
There was a great storm.

31:34.118 --> 31:36.167
One that would have raised
the depths of the Niger

31:36.390 --> 31:39.014
enough to allow the boat
to get here, yes.

31:46.727 --> 31:48.966
It is written here.

31:49.799 --> 31:52.166
Six days after the great storm,

31:52.391 --> 31:57.895
a dark ship rode without sails
under the banner of a single star.

31:58.535 --> 32:02.630
It was driven upriver,
never to return.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.934
Bearing...

32:05.767 --> 32:07.303
...death.

32:08.390 --> 32:11.174
It brought a sickness
from here up to Gao

32:11.911 --> 32:15.815
and bore over 300 souls to heaven.

32:16.071 --> 32:18.919
It was believed a damnation
from Allah.

32:19.527 --> 32:21.351
A ghost ship.

32:21.543 --> 32:23.463
A cursed ship.

32:31.655 --> 32:33.063
What does that mean?

32:43.143 --> 32:44.839
- What?
- That's Arabic, Al.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.536
Yeah. Sounds poetic.
What's it mean?

32:46.728 --> 32:48.456
"The ship of death."

32:48.648 --> 32:50.568
Great. Should we call Sandecker?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.647
- No.
- What ship? Whose death?

32:52.839 --> 32:54.120
He'd just tell us to come home.

32:54.312 --> 32:56.679
- Sounds reasonable.
- Yeah, then I'd get a case of tequila.

32:56.871 --> 32:58.855
Boys, we are going upriver to Gao.

32:59.047 --> 33:02.280
All right. Rudi, you gonna run
the sonar on the riverbed?

33:02.472 --> 33:04.999
Come on, I was hoping to meet
a girl on the Australia trip.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.527
No, African war zone. Ship of death.

33:12.711 --> 33:14.439
Bye.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.152
- Got a profile.
- Another truck bumper?

33:42.792 --> 33:44.072
Bicycle? VCR?

33:44.264 --> 33:47.400
Sixteen degrees, twenty-decimal-zero
minutes north, zero...

33:47.592 --> 33:50.184
Wait, hold on. It's just
some interference with the buoy.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.104
- Al.
- Yeah, I got it.

33:52.296 --> 33:53.544
When did you check the calibration?

33:53.736 --> 33:55.176
I had it out of the water
three hours ago.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.808
All right.

33:58.824 --> 34:01.096
- Anything, Al?
- Hey, guys.

34:01.288 --> 34:03.656
Take a look at this.

34:08.137 --> 34:09.960
It's red algae.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.937
That doesn't make any sense,
this is fresh water.

34:13.417 --> 34:14.953
- I'd better get a sample.
- Yep.

34:31.239 --> 34:34.536
It's okay, they're just looking
for Tuareg fighters.

35:05.001 --> 35:07.177
Very well, thank you.

35:07.753 --> 35:09.513
For you.

35:11.497 --> 35:12.905
Join me.

35:13.161 --> 35:14.889
Thank you.

35:17.097 --> 35:20.361
These belonged
to General Mayenne.

35:22.442 --> 35:25.673
Then one of them actually killed
the Comte de Vezelay.

35:26.601 --> 35:29.289
Isn't that fascinating?

35:30.506 --> 35:33.225
Beads for the natives, Yves.

35:33.993 --> 35:35.690
What do you want?

35:36.009 --> 35:40.137
Well, you know the doctors
I was telling you about?

35:40.329 --> 35:43.785
I am afraid they're
on their way to Mali.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.529
I thought your man was going
to take care of them in Lagos.

35:47.753 --> 35:50.314
- Well, we had a problem.
- And now the problem is mine.

35:55.562 --> 35:58.186
And another thing, general,
if I may say,

35:58.793 --> 36:02.570
I am slightly concerned
your measures of containment

36:02.762 --> 36:04.234
are losing their effectiveness.

36:04.426 --> 36:07.690
Why? Because five or six poor souls
escaped from Mali

36:07.882 --> 36:10.217
- And died in their beds?
- The disease spreads quickly.

36:10.409 --> 36:13.482
And luckily, it kills quickly too.

36:14.602 --> 36:19.050
General, I think you should control
the movements of your population.

36:19.306 --> 36:20.362
What's that?

36:21.578 --> 36:24.426
Are you trying to tell me
how to run my country?

36:24.682 --> 36:27.018
You take care
of your business, Yves.

36:27.530 --> 36:29.066
I'll take care of mine.

36:29.706 --> 36:31.210
Of course.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.098
- Rocks?
- Nope.

36:33.290 --> 36:36.618
- River? Radio?
- Nope.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.210
- Radar?
- Rudi.

36:39.402 --> 36:40.682
- You... That's not...
- It is.

36:40.874 --> 36:42.699
- He can't even...
- Here we go again. I spy.

36:42.891 --> 36:46.347
- All right, something I might get.
- I spy...

36:46.539 --> 36:48.874
- I spy with my little eye...
- Guys.

36:51.435 --> 36:53.578
- Company.
- This is the Malian Civil Authority.

36:53.802 --> 36:55.786
- I got it.
- Prepare to be boarded.

36:56.010 --> 36:58.026
You are trespassing
in Malian waters.

36:58.218 --> 36:59.658
Shut off your engine
and throw out a rope.

36:59.883 --> 37:02.218
Hi, this is Al Giordino speaking.

37:02.410 --> 37:05.259
Al, Sandecker. I presume you're on
your way home with my boat?

37:05.451 --> 37:07.083
- Everyone on deck, right now.
- It's for you.

37:07.275 --> 37:09.162
- Al, what's going on?
- Where are the doctors?

37:09.387 --> 37:11.370
Where are they? We are looking
for the doctors.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.219
I have to put you on hold. I don't
believe this is a normal shakedown, Al.

37:14.411 --> 37:18.731
If you do not shut off your engine,
you run the risk of being fired upon.

37:18.923 --> 37:21.291
The doctors. We are looking
for the doctors. Where are they?

37:21.483 --> 37:24.042
- Where is the woman?
- I'm sorry. I don't speak English.

37:24.267 --> 37:25.995
You are speaking English now.

37:26.187 --> 37:29.483
No, no. I only know how to say,
"I don't speak English," in English.

37:31.755 --> 37:34.347
- Al.
- Hi. Hold on.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.547
Stop! Stop the engines now
before we open fire.

37:41.355 --> 37:42.411
Whoa, hat!

37:47.723 --> 37:49.963
- Did you get my hat?
- Sorry, it's gone.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.043
That's my favorite hat.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.988
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38:07.564 --> 38:10.603
- Where's Dirk?
- I think he's...

38:21.707 --> 38:23.020
Hold on.

38:56.972 --> 38:58.508
Dirk! Dirk.

39:07.532 --> 39:10.508
I'm gonna come in.
You jump on the front.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.452
- You want me to jump?
- Get on the front of the boat. Got it?

39:13.836 --> 39:15.468
- Really?
- What am I...?

39:24.300 --> 39:25.805
- Al!
- What?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.052
Here, flare gun.

39:31.277 --> 39:33.420
- Signal for help?
- No, shoot them.

39:42.188 --> 39:43.500
- Hey!
- Sorry.

39:47.245 --> 39:48.653
Come a little closer, babe. Come.

39:55.501 --> 39:56.717
Oh, yeah!

40:16.813 --> 40:18.221
That is what I'm talking about.

40:46.285 --> 40:48.781
- Are you all right?
- That was close.

40:48.973 --> 40:50.349
- Al, pick up the phone,
- Yeah, it was.

40:50.541 --> 40:51.949
- How about you?
- Pick up the phone,

40:52.173 --> 40:53.550
- Glad I'm driving.
- Still there?

40:53.742 --> 40:55.341
- I am too.
- What the hell is going on?

40:55.533 --> 40:56.941
I shot a guy with a flare gun.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.893
- A flare gun? What?
- Cool.

40:59.085 --> 40:59.565
What did you... ? Did you say you
shot someone with a flare gun?

40:59.629 --> 41:02.029
What did you... ? Did you say you
shot someone with a flare gun?

41:02.253 --> 41:03.789
- What?
- Who?

41:06.926 --> 41:07.917
Don't put the phone...

41:10.605 --> 41:12.014
Rudi?

41:20.846 --> 41:24.110
Who's shooting? Al, who's shooting?
Is someone shooting at you?

41:24.494 --> 41:25.710
You'd better not hurt my boat,

41:27.470 --> 41:28.557
Engine two is out.

41:29.294 --> 41:31.118
Fourth and long, man.
What do you wanna do?

41:33.870 --> 41:37.806
- I think we need to pull a Panama.
- A Panama. A Panama?!

41:38.894 --> 41:40.526
- Panama?
- You think? Really?

41:40.750 --> 41:42.286
- Yeah. Really.
- No Panama,

41:42.510 --> 41:45.806
Somebody pick up... They're
ignoring me. They're ignoring...

41:46.030 --> 41:48.078
Everybody's ignoring me.
Pick up the phone!

41:48.270 --> 41:50.094
Take it. We're doing a Panama.
We're doing a Panama!

41:50.286 --> 41:51.662
- What's a Panama?
- Navy thing.

41:51.854 --> 41:54.414
- I didn't know you were in Panama.
- Weren't. We were in Nicaragua.

41:54.862 --> 41:57.678
- Then why do you call it a Panama?
- We thought we were in Panama.

41:57.870 --> 42:00.238
No Panama,

42:00.943 --> 42:03.950
What are you looking for? Al!

42:14.671 --> 42:17.198
Al. Al, I'm really confused.

42:24.782 --> 42:26.830
How we doing, Al?

42:27.694 --> 42:29.103
- Go help Dirk.
- What do I do with this?

42:29.326 --> 42:30.543
Just go!

42:31.279 --> 42:32.431
Down.

42:35.374 --> 42:36.783
- Open the engine hatch.
- Okay.

42:38.799 --> 42:40.111
Let's go, Al.

42:44.815 --> 42:46.222
Got it.

42:47.470 --> 42:49.359
Here, light this.

42:49.582 --> 42:52.975
- Aren't these the admiral's?
- Just light it.

43:01.583 --> 43:03.279
What the...?

43:03.663 --> 43:05.007
Whenever you're ready, Al.

43:05.199 --> 43:07.023
- Come on!
- What are we doing?

43:07.727 --> 43:10.287
- I don't think you should be doing that.
- Okay. Drop it.

43:10.479 --> 43:12.591
- We're good.
- Yeah?

43:12.783 --> 43:14.191
- All right, hold on.
- Hold on.

43:14.415 --> 43:15.791
Okay.

43:20.399 --> 43:21.615
Al!

43:30.063 --> 43:31.439
Hey, I need a life jacket.

43:49.775 --> 43:51.311
Crap.

43:51.536 --> 43:53.423
He did a Panama.

43:54.352 --> 43:55.504
He did a Panama.

43:57.328 --> 43:58.768
Cool.

43:58.991 --> 44:01.648
- Is that how it worked the first time?
- Well...

44:01.840 --> 44:04.559
...it didn't really work
the first time.

44:06.736 --> 44:09.104
- I lost my hat.
- Again?

44:09.328 --> 44:10.480
Yeah.

44:21.616 --> 44:23.024
Man, is Sandecker gonna be mad

44:23.216 --> 44:25.392
when you tell him
you lost the satellite phone.

44:25.584 --> 44:28.208
Not as mad as when Rudi tells him
it was attached to the boat.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.248
- Wait. Why me?
- Because we're not going back.

44:31.472 --> 44:33.360
- Right, Dirk?
- Nope. We're going to Asselar.

44:33.584 --> 44:37.040
- No more Texas?
- Ironclad's on hold for a while, guys.

44:37.232 --> 44:39.792
Those soldiers weren't after us.
They were after the doctors.

44:39.984 --> 44:42.960
I got a feeling whatever bug
Eva's chasing, it must be a doozy.

44:43.152 --> 44:45.009
- We gotta get there first.
- I'm going with you.

44:45.201 --> 44:47.088
- Nope, you gotta tell Sandecker.
- Hold on. Hold on.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.001
How am I gonna get across the border?
I never took survival training.

44:50.224 --> 44:52.305
- Consider this your course.
- It's kind of pass-fail,

44:52.528 --> 44:53.937
which I always thought was easier.

44:54.192 --> 44:57.744
Look, Rudi. Lay up here till dark, then
make your move. The border's not far.

44:57.936 --> 44:59.217
- Okay.
- All right.

45:00.624 --> 45:03.376
Al, you remember
that time in Morocco?

45:03.568 --> 45:06.641
Oh, yeah, when you made me ride
that damn camel

45:06.833 --> 45:10.128
- That bit my ass.
- Yeah, that's the time.

45:11.313 --> 45:12.720
Why?

45:20.465 --> 45:23.568
God! What is the secret
to this thing?

45:23.793 --> 45:26.160
Just wrap it around your nugget.

45:26.832 --> 45:30.449
- What part? Here? This?
- Yeah.

45:31.665 --> 45:34.385
Well, how come yours stays on?

45:34.993 --> 45:36.625
Maybe you got a small head.

45:36.817 --> 45:41.073
I don't think so.
Somebody would've told me.

46:04.913 --> 46:06.481
Thank you.

46:11.441 --> 46:13.169
World Health Organization.

46:13.553 --> 46:15.154
Hello?

46:15.505 --> 46:17.362
Is anyone here?

46:22.961 --> 46:24.370
Frank.

46:24.946 --> 46:26.641
Look at this.

46:41.233 --> 46:42.642
Anyone here?

46:48.946 --> 46:50.610
Hello?

46:55.026 --> 46:56.434
Hello?

47:10.930 --> 47:12.946
Oh, my God.

48:26.163 --> 48:28.851
This well was filled in recently.

48:29.043 --> 48:31.411
I think people here knew
the water was making them sick.

48:31.603 --> 48:34.099
I still say we should
let Oumar go down.

48:34.291 --> 48:36.531
Oumar, you wouldn't mind
going down that well, would you?

48:36.755 --> 48:38.163
- No, it's okay. I'll go down.
- You see?

48:38.388 --> 48:40.116
Frank, I'll be fine.

48:50.100 --> 48:51.987
Yeah, there you go.

48:53.683 --> 48:56.659
All right, you're looking good.
You're looking good.

48:57.204 --> 48:59.316
- Give her a little more rope.
- Okay.

49:02.580 --> 49:03.891
Be careful, please.

49:05.172 --> 49:06.612
Just take your time.

49:07.155 --> 49:08.115
Eva.

49:08.724 --> 49:09.908
Eva, hold on.

49:10.932 --> 49:13.268
Eva. Hold on. We've got you.

49:13.491 --> 49:14.547
- You got it?
- It's okay.

49:15.603 --> 49:18.099
- Bring her up.
- No, I'm fine.

49:18.771 --> 49:20.052
Give me more rope.

49:26.996 --> 49:29.492
Got it. I made it.

49:41.844 --> 49:43.956
- Got water.
- All right, great.

49:44.180 --> 49:46.324
Get what we need,
and let's get you out of there.

49:46.964 --> 49:49.556
Hey, looks like we've got company.

49:50.836 --> 49:52.980
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

49:53.172 --> 49:54.388
Okay.

49:54.580 --> 49:56.820
Hello there. I'm Dr. Hopper with
the World Health Organization.

49:57.013 --> 49:59.764
- You have no authority to be here.
- What are you doing?

49:59.956 --> 50:02.293
Eva, get those... Oh, my God!

50:03.412 --> 50:05.236
- Frank!
- Charlie, please don't shoot me.

50:05.557 --> 50:07.093
Charlie, don't...

50:33.364 --> 50:35.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
do you hear that?

50:57.621 --> 50:59.381
- This is all of them?
- Yes, sir.

51:00.789 --> 51:05.525
The UN knows that we're here. This is
a United Nations-sanctioned mission.

51:09.141 --> 51:10.293
Where's your colleague?

51:13.365 --> 51:15.221
No, no, no, no, no.

51:15.413 --> 51:17.397
I mean, the woman.

51:19.670 --> 51:22.262
She didn't come. She's ill.

51:24.021 --> 51:28.310
This pistol, it belonged
to General Sir Henry Watkins.

51:28.533 --> 51:31.733
.455 caliber. Very rare.

51:32.117 --> 51:34.613
Hard to find the rounds.

51:35.861 --> 51:39.573
I have them made
by Holland & Holland of London.

51:41.942 --> 51:45.749
Twenty-seven pounds each.

51:47.254 --> 51:49.654
You should put the money
to better use.

51:51.221 --> 51:52.630
Like containing this plague.

52:07.862 --> 52:09.270
I will give you some advice.

52:10.838 --> 52:13.526
Tell me where Dr. Rojas is.

52:14.326 --> 52:16.182
She's not here.

52:17.686 --> 52:19.702
Have it your own way.

52:30.550 --> 52:34.934
Make it look like a horde of Tuareg
swine just came through here.

52:35.702 --> 52:37.174
- And find the woman.
- Yes, sir.

52:37.398 --> 52:38.614
She's here.

52:39.574 --> 52:41.271
Somewhere.

53:13.494 --> 53:15.030
You men, set up a perimeter.

53:15.222 --> 53:17.334
I want you to search
the whole town.

53:17.879 --> 53:21.335
- Hey, Salim, come over here.
- Yes, sir.

53:48.503 --> 53:51.575
Open up a few rounds
just to be sure.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.936
Hey.

54:48.920 --> 54:51.224
Al, little help here.

55:00.696 --> 55:02.456
Oh, man.

55:53.624 --> 55:55.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Eva.

56:00.217 --> 56:01.592
Come on. You okay?

56:01.784 --> 56:03.577
- Yeah.
- Come on.

56:04.921 --> 56:06.681
We gotta go.

56:07.673 --> 56:10.073
Wait. Wait!

56:11.001 --> 56:12.665
Frank!

56:13.721 --> 56:15.129
Frank!

56:19.929 --> 56:21.625
We're done here.

56:43.897 --> 56:46.617
We're in Tuareg country now.

56:47.385 --> 56:51.129
We're gonna drive north about
three hours till we hit the flatlands.

56:51.321 --> 56:55.161
From there it should be a relatively
easy drive to the Algerian border.

56:56.089 --> 56:57.817
Sorry.

56:58.905 --> 57:00.345
Eva.

57:02.394 --> 57:04.026
Eva.

57:07.065 --> 57:09.242
We'll get through, huh?

57:14.874 --> 57:16.634
- This way.
- Please tell me what I am doing here.

57:16.826 --> 57:20.282
Five men shot dead in cold blood.
What do you think about that?

57:20.474 --> 57:22.713
Hardly my responsibility.

57:22.905 --> 57:24.698
No, no, no, you sit, you sit.

57:24.890 --> 57:26.778
You are a very brave man.

57:27.002 --> 57:28.250
The only survivor.

57:28.442 --> 57:30.714
Crawled all the way from Asselar
to bring me the news.

57:30.906 --> 57:33.754
- How very commendable.
- Caught in a classic Tuareg ambush,

57:33.946 --> 57:35.802
- Wouldn't you say?
- Possibly.

57:35.994 --> 57:39.610
One problem.
There were no Tuareg.

57:56.251 --> 57:59.899
Why didn't you tell me the doctors
had American military support?

58:00.091 --> 58:03.451
- Because they didn't.
- The two unarmed men who did this...

58:04.603 --> 58:08.314
...they were not amateurs, Yves.
Nor were the ones on the boat.

58:08.506 --> 58:11.354
- And they're the same men, I think.
- They're treasure hunters, general.

58:11.578 --> 58:13.178
Marine salvage, they call themselves.

58:13.402 --> 58:17.338
- Hardly your military elite.
- Don't underestimate them.

58:17.818 --> 58:22.011
Watch out. And if you find them,
bring them to me.

58:49.051 --> 58:50.939
What is it?

58:54.491 --> 58:55.643
Get out of the Jeep.

58:56.411 --> 58:58.299
Keep your hands up.

58:58.491 --> 59:00.443
Move slowly.

59:22.235 --> 59:23.547
What?

59:35.516 --> 59:36.668
Three o'clock.

01:00:04.379 --> 01:00:05.628
Tuaregs!

01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:10.108
Hi. How are you?

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.837
Al, did you see that?
No, hang on a minute.

01:01:12.477 --> 01:01:13.853
Who are you...

01:01:14.844 --> 01:01:16.668
...and why are you here?

01:01:17.436 --> 01:01:19.517
We are enemies of Kazim.

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:22.620
You are American.

01:01:25.661 --> 01:01:26.749
CIA?

01:01:28.509 --> 01:01:30.269
No.

01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:36.989
I'm a doctor from
the World Health Organization.

01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:41.213
I'm investigating the source
of a disease.

01:01:48.893 --> 01:01:50.941
Come with me.

01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:03.197
This is the disease
you are looking for?

01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:09.373
I believe it is.

01:02:16.061 --> 01:02:19.902
All right. Ready to go, big D, big D.

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.558
It's not a plague.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.310
- What?
- It's not a plague. It's a poison.

01:02:53.502 --> 01:02:55.294
There are toxins in the water,
here and in Asselar.

01:02:55.486 --> 01:02:56.414
- Toxins?
- Yes.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.654
That's what's making
these people sick.

01:03:00.286 --> 01:03:01.726
Can you treat it?

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.214
No.

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:11.102
- Admiral, what can I do for you?
- What do you hear from Mali?

01:03:11.294 --> 01:03:14.622
- Beautiful country.
- Oh, kiss my ass.

01:03:14.846 --> 01:03:18.719
I hear about a couple of
American boys and their fancy yacht

01:03:18.942 --> 01:03:21.311
getting in some trouble on the Niger.

01:03:21.534 --> 01:03:22.847
Does the agency have
a presence there?

01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:24.926
No, it's strictly hands-off.

01:03:25.118 --> 01:03:26.430
- Carl.
- What?

01:03:26.622 --> 01:03:28.415
I gotta get my boys out.

01:03:28.607 --> 01:03:30.942
They're private citizens.
Now, if they choose to go down there

01:03:31.134 --> 01:03:33.438
and get themselves shot up
over some sunken treasure,

01:03:33.662 --> 01:03:35.582
that is not a company problem.

01:03:35.838 --> 01:03:38.047
- I'm not asking the company.
- Yeah.

01:03:38.239 --> 01:03:39.902
You've got some nerve.

01:03:40.094 --> 01:03:41.503
Come down here
compromising my cover,

01:03:41.695 --> 01:03:44.735
and now you're gonna ask me to risk
my whole career over this nonsense?

01:03:44.927 --> 01:03:48.062
Well, since you put it that way...

01:03:48.254 --> 01:03:49.982
...yes, I am.
- No, you're not,

01:03:50.174 --> 01:03:52.415
because I'm not gonna do it.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:55.391
I'm not gonna do it.

01:03:56.798 --> 01:04:00.991
October 27th, 1982.

01:04:01.886 --> 01:04:05.567
- Yeah, I knew you'd bring that up.
- And now I have.

01:04:13.343 --> 01:04:15.647
- If I do this, we are even.
- The slate's clean.

01:04:15.679 --> 01:04:17.407
- If I do this, we are even.
- The slate's clean.

01:04:19.615 --> 01:04:21.759
I'll see what I can do.

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:24.639
Always a pleasure, my friend.

01:04:27.775 --> 01:04:30.335
Benzine, heavy metals, nitrates,

01:04:30.527 --> 01:04:33.823
Basically, the water's toxic.

01:04:37.215 --> 01:04:38.943
I understand.

01:04:40.287 --> 01:04:43.231
But Kazim's men followed your trail.

01:04:44.064 --> 01:04:47.424
You must leave tomorrow
at first light.

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:51.711
Modibo.

01:04:52.128 --> 01:04:54.912
Eva found the same poison
in the wells at Asselar.

01:04:55.104 --> 01:04:59.391
- It's over 300 miles from here.
- Africa will find a place for us.

01:04:59.616 --> 01:05:01.952
Modibo...

01:05:02.592 --> 01:05:04.064
...we have to find the source.

01:05:04.287 --> 01:05:06.015
That is for you.

01:05:06.207 --> 01:05:08.576
My duty is here with my people.

01:05:13.248 --> 01:05:15.168
We leave in the morning.

01:05:16.128 --> 01:05:19.200
I've heard that my car
pleases your eyes.

01:05:23.776 --> 01:05:26.912
It's a 1936 Avions Voisin.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.120
Six cylinders, sleeve-valve engine.

01:05:29.312 --> 01:05:32.224
Do you know there was only
six of these ever made?

01:05:33.728 --> 01:05:36.832
- How the hell did you get it?
- We borrowed it...

01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:39.776
...from Kazim.

01:05:46.016 --> 01:05:48.672
Bye. Thank you.

01:05:48.864 --> 01:05:51.136
Okay, ready? I'll do it. I'll do it.

01:05:51.328 --> 01:05:54.976
Okay, here we go. Come on.
New Al record right here.

01:06:25.984 --> 01:06:27.201
I got something you gotta see.

01:06:27.393 --> 01:06:28.768
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.529
- All right, give me a minute.
- Come on!

01:06:35.233 --> 01:06:37.953
That is your Texas we're looking at,
isn't it?

01:06:38.145 --> 01:06:39.873
- Sure the hell looks like it.
- Yeah.

01:06:40.065 --> 01:06:42.177
- Sitting in the middle of the desert.
- Yep.

01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:45.281
Hey, I am not paying off the tequila
on a picture, okay?

01:06:45.537 --> 01:06:48.641
Ship of the desert's a camel.
It's not an ironclad battleship.

01:06:48.865 --> 01:06:51.649
I mean, there is no way that
that could get across the desert.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.689
At one time, much of this desert
was lush, green farmland,

01:06:54.913 --> 01:06:57.281
and there were rivers everywhere.

01:06:57.921 --> 01:07:00.513
Now, the ironclad obviously
came up this river

01:07:00.705 --> 01:07:04.417
and stopped at this structure,
which is a fort? A castle? I don't know.

01:07:04.865 --> 01:07:06.017
So the climate changed.

01:07:06.209 --> 01:07:08.577
So let's say the water level dropped,
and the boat became stranded.

01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:10.754
Yeah, or sailed away.

01:07:10.977 --> 01:07:13.889
Or the land dried up,
the soil turned to dust,

01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:15.617
the sands blew in,

01:07:15.842 --> 01:07:19.425
and the ship is still buried
to this day...

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:23.234
...right here, next to the structure.
- Okay, great.

01:07:23.489 --> 01:07:26.049
So all we have to do is wait
for the river to fill up again

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:27.650
and sail the Texas home.

01:07:29.249 --> 01:07:30.689
- That's how it's spreading.
- What is?

01:07:30.914 --> 01:07:31.841
The toxins.

01:07:32.066 --> 01:07:33.953
What, in the dried-up,
nonexistent river?

01:07:34.178 --> 01:07:38.242
No, no, no. The same river that was on
the surface 150 years ago still exists.

01:07:38.434 --> 01:07:40.258
It's just beneath our feet now,
sunk in the sand,

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.209
running along the rock strata.

01:07:42.401 --> 01:07:44.354
Now, the toxins are obviously leeching
from their source

01:07:44.578 --> 01:07:46.370
into the underground river system.

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.730
- Spreading from well to well.
- Exactly.

01:07:50.273 --> 01:07:54.113
So we find your Texas,
we find the underground river.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:58.145
We find the river,
we find the source of the toxins.

01:08:04.066 --> 01:08:05.730
- Admiral...
- Not now.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:28.098
Rudi?

01:08:28.482 --> 01:08:29.761
Admiral.

01:08:32.354 --> 01:08:34.113
I have some bad news
about your boat.

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:56.930
According to the cave painting,
this is the place.

01:09:01.379 --> 01:09:05.187
You know, Al, if we were here
150 years ago,

01:09:05.411 --> 01:09:07.715
we'd be swimming right now.

01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:21.411
Hey.

01:09:21.827 --> 01:09:23.779
Hey, you know how it is
when you see someone

01:09:24.002 --> 01:09:26.082
that you haven't seen
since high school,

01:09:26.307 --> 01:09:28.131
and they got some dead-end job,

01:09:28.323 --> 01:09:30.499
and they're married to some woman
that hates them,

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.122
they got, like, three kids
that thinks he's a joke?

01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:35.747
Wasn't there some point
where he stood back and said,

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.371
"Bob, don't take that job.

01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:41.763
Bob, don't marry that harpy,"
you know?

01:09:41.955 --> 01:09:43.395
Your point?

01:09:43.618 --> 01:09:46.691
Well, we're in the middle of a desert,

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:49.411
Iooking for the source
of a river pollutant,

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:53.731
using as our map a cave drawing
of a Civil War gunship,

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.427
- Which is also in the desert.
- Right.

01:09:55.651 --> 01:09:57.635
So I was just wondering
when we're gonna have to sit down

01:09:57.892 --> 01:10:00.547
and reevaluate
our decision-making paradigm.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.884
I don't know.

01:10:03.715 --> 01:10:05.795
Working so far.

01:10:23.107 --> 01:10:24.835
- Hey, Al.
- Yep?

01:10:25.027 --> 01:10:26.884
- Let me see the scope.
- Sure.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:30.468
- What do you see?
- I don't know.

01:10:36.036 --> 01:10:37.987
It looks like a solar energy plant.

01:10:38.628 --> 01:10:39.619
That's strange.

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:43.396
There's a collecting tower...

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.268
...but no outgoing transmission lines.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.316
"Massarde Enterprises."

01:10:53.508 --> 01:10:55.332
Massarde? Yves Massarde?

01:10:55.876 --> 01:10:58.948
Well, whoever it is,
they've got heavy security.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.748
Let's check it out.

01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:44.612
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:11:48.293 --> 01:11:49.765
Come on, come on!

01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:55.909
Al!

01:12:15.973 --> 01:12:18.277
Come on, Eva, kick him. Let's go!

01:12:19.077 --> 01:12:21.029
One, two, three.

01:12:23.077 --> 01:12:24.485
I got you.

01:12:59.238 --> 01:13:00.678
- You okay?
- Yes.

01:13:00.902 --> 01:13:02.661
- Nice job, doc.
- Thank you.

01:13:02.853 --> 01:13:04.293
- How we doing, Al?
- Great.

01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:06.213
Get in the hole.

01:13:35.462 --> 01:13:38.310
- Admiral!
- Not now, Rudi. I don't have time.

01:13:38.534 --> 01:13:41.414
Yes, sir, you do.

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:50.278
That... That's not possible.

01:13:56.678 --> 01:14:00.710
Yellow Five, report to station three,

01:14:03.175 --> 01:14:08.102
Loading procedure commencing,
Extraction protocol complete,

01:14:15.526 --> 01:14:17.671
Please ensure all active materials

01:14:17.895 --> 01:14:20.614
are securely stored,
Thank you for your cooperation,

01:14:20.806 --> 01:14:22.759
- What the hell is this place?
- Good question.

01:14:26.727 --> 01:14:29.575
These barrels here are probably full
of chemical waste.

01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.391
They're going in that chamber...

01:14:34.983 --> 01:14:37.159
...they're coming out
the other side empty.

01:14:39.303 --> 01:14:42.599
They're using the solar power
to superheat and vaporize the toxins.

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:43.847
That's smart. Looks clean too.

01:14:43.911 --> 01:14:45.831
That's smart. Looks clean too.

01:14:46.823 --> 01:14:48.519
What about those barrels?

01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:34.600
Hi. How are you?

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.215
Oh, my God.

01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:49.832
Well, I think we found your source.

01:16:13.768 --> 01:16:15.720
Tuareg prisoners.

01:16:16.392 --> 01:16:19.208
These must be the soldiers
captured from Modibo's village.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.064
He thought they were dead.

01:16:21.256 --> 01:16:24.072
This Massarde guy's really starting
to piss me off.

01:16:24.264 --> 01:16:26.152
Well, it's time to call in the cavalry.

01:16:27.432 --> 01:16:28.744
Let's go.

01:16:30.792 --> 01:16:33.672
Well, Dr. Rojas, I do wish
you had stayed in Lagos.

01:16:41.224 --> 01:16:42.537
So...

01:16:42.984 --> 01:16:44.457
... got your report,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.473
Kind of dense, huh?

01:16:49.416 --> 01:16:51.528
Okay, my understanding is...

01:16:52.072 --> 01:16:55.497
...there's a problem with the water.
Am I right?

01:16:55.752 --> 01:16:56.681
Rudi?

01:16:56.873 --> 01:16:59.145
The water in the Niger River
is being poisoned.

01:16:59.496 --> 01:17:03.336
Right now, it's in Mali,
but it's headed toward us fast.

01:17:03.561 --> 01:17:06.825
If we don't do something, within
one week it's gonna hit the Atlantic.

01:17:07.464 --> 01:17:10.248
And when that interacts
with the salt water,

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.777
that growth rate is gonna explode.

01:17:13.608 --> 01:17:15.689
The oxygen levels
in the affected waters

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:19.657
will decrease by 40 to 60 percent,
killing all plant and animal life.

01:17:20.073 --> 01:17:21.801
If it gets to the ocean,

01:17:21.993 --> 01:17:24.585
it's halfway to New York
within six months.

01:17:24.777 --> 01:17:26.697
Then there's nothing we can do.

01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:31.369
Is that all?

01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:41.257
Do you have
any independent confirmation?

01:17:41.737 --> 01:17:43.113
- Nope.
- Because intervening

01:17:43.305 --> 01:17:45.801
in a sovereign country, granted I'm
only in the job a couple of months,

01:17:46.025 --> 01:17:48.010
I'm pretty sure that's gonna
be tough to get an okay for.

01:17:48.233 --> 01:17:50.506
- I need you to try.
- Oh, I'm gonna look into this. I am.

01:17:50.698 --> 01:17:54.121
I'm gonna pass this on to the State
Department, get their take on this.

01:17:54.346 --> 01:17:56.905
Okay, I think that's the best way
to proceed.

01:17:57.097 --> 01:17:59.050
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:18:24.841 --> 01:18:26.250
Al.

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:30.634
Where the hell are we?

01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:34.057
I don't know.

01:18:34.858 --> 01:18:35.818
Where's Eva?

01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:39.306
So the two Americans,
they're on their way, general.

01:18:40.714 --> 01:18:42.730
The doctor? Well...

01:18:42.954 --> 01:18:45.674
I'm afraid there has been
an incident, general.

01:18:45.866 --> 01:18:49.098
An exchange of gunfire,
most unfortunate.

01:18:50.922 --> 01:18:53.226
She... She's dead.

01:18:53.418 --> 01:18:57.194
Yes, general. I'm sorry, I...

01:19:03.914 --> 01:19:07.242
You know, Dr. Rojas,
you're lucky I'm such a gentleman.

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:12.746
Enabling program, phase two,
Please ensure all active materials...

01:19:12.938 --> 01:19:14.922
Who else knows you're here?

01:19:20.651 --> 01:19:24.746
This facility is a miracle
of modern science.

01:19:24.938 --> 01:19:26.666
State-of-the-art technology.

01:19:26.858 --> 01:19:28.970
Solar energy harnessed
to destroy the world's contaminants.

01:19:29.162 --> 01:19:30.794
Not such a bad idea after all.

01:19:30.986 --> 01:19:32.971
- It's a toxic-waste dump.
- It's not so simple.

01:19:33.194 --> 01:19:36.043
You see, all new technology
has enemies.

01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:38.378
Sandstorms, for example,
they chip away at the mirrors.

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:41.899
Productivity falls, and the waste
needs to be stored underground.

01:19:42.155 --> 01:19:47.275
So we have developed new laminate
coating to protect the mirrors.

01:19:47.467 --> 01:19:52.106
And with this new approach, our
problems should now be in the past.

01:19:52.298 --> 01:19:54.251
You're poisoning
a river system underground.

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.483
It's spreading across Western Africa.

01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:03.243
You're wrong. That's impossible.

01:20:04.203 --> 01:20:05.771
Securing burn chamber,

01:20:06.571 --> 01:20:07.595
Who else knows you're here?

01:20:08.811 --> 01:20:10.123
The Nigerian government.

01:20:10.795 --> 01:20:12.107
The WHO.

01:20:17.675 --> 01:20:20.043
No one else knows you're here,
do they?

01:20:23.723 --> 01:20:25.995
Initiate system safety check,

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.315
What are you doing?

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.147
I got it.

01:20:40.747 --> 01:20:41.739
Die.

01:20:45.643 --> 01:20:47.052
Live.

01:20:51.564 --> 01:20:52.971
You got it?

01:20:56.012 --> 01:20:57.579
Clear?

01:20:58.188 --> 01:20:59.211
Got it.

01:21:05.739 --> 01:21:07.947
Ready? One, two, three.

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:10.635
One, two, three.

01:21:19.788 --> 01:21:22.156
Wait. Not good. Not good. New plan!

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.948
- I like it.
- No!

01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:51.692
Well...

01:21:53.036 --> 01:21:56.108
...that's a new one.
- Yeah.

01:21:57.004 --> 01:21:59.372
We're home free now.

01:22:02.797 --> 01:22:03.820
Sweet, sweet, sweet

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:06.860
Run fast, she don't
But she swims real well

01:22:07.052 --> 01:22:09.740
Racing through the water
With a swish of her tail

01:22:09.932 --> 01:22:12.717
She's my little mermaid

01:22:22.252 --> 01:22:24.141
Massarde, your packages
have not arrived,

01:22:24.364 --> 01:22:25.741
Apparently they were lost
in the desert,

01:22:25.933 --> 01:22:28.749
- Yes, I heard.
- Tell me, Yves, the doctor?

01:22:28.941 --> 01:22:31.084
- Promise me she's dead.
- Oh, yes, yes.

01:22:31.276 --> 01:22:33.709
Be a shame to fall out
over a woman, no?

01:22:33.933 --> 01:22:35.245
General, I've come here to tell you

01:22:35.437 --> 01:22:37.549
that I think we should suspend
waste shipments to the plant

01:22:37.741 --> 01:22:38.989
- For the time being.
- Nonsense.

01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:42.541
The borders are all closed. The sick
are either quarantined or dead.

01:22:42.765 --> 01:22:46.157
I did not expend all these resources
only to see my profits shrink.

01:22:46.413 --> 01:22:47.853
Yes, but I have good reasons
to believe

01:22:48.109 --> 01:22:49.837
the toxins are in the Niger River.

01:22:50.029 --> 01:22:53.357
Then the problem is no longer ours,
but our neighbors' downstream.

01:22:53.613 --> 01:22:55.085
They will soon find out.
The Americans did.

01:22:55.309 --> 01:22:59.181
Okay, Yves, as you please.
Close the plant.

01:22:59.405 --> 01:23:02.797
But your payments to me
will continue.

01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:05.198
Okay?

01:23:05.774 --> 01:23:08.366
Don't worry. It's Africa.

01:23:08.558 --> 01:23:11.469
Nobody cares about Africa.

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:16.685
This photo was taken 24 hours ago.

01:23:17.421 --> 01:23:19.886
Normally, Kazim likes to keep his tanks
where he can see them,

01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:22.029
in case the people get frisky.

01:23:22.253 --> 01:23:25.070
This one, taken four hours ago,

01:23:25.262 --> 01:23:28.109
shows the tanks mobilizing north
to the desert.

01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:31.598
And my guess,
and intelligence supports this,

01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:35.086
- They're looking for your boys.
- Well, we'll have to find them first.

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:36.590
We already did.

01:23:36.782 --> 01:23:39.086
Yesterday they showed up
in a Tuareg village

01:23:39.278 --> 01:23:42.862
- About 200 miles northwest of Gao.
- That's within range.

01:23:43.054 --> 01:23:44.942
You could get choppers in there
if you flew at night.

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:48.014
- But your boys already left.
- Left? Where? Going where?

01:23:48.238 --> 01:23:51.406
Well, based on their behavior
so far...

01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:54.317
...I have no idea.

01:25:13.902 --> 01:25:16.975
- Dirk.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see it.

01:25:22.767 --> 01:25:25.935
Well, you don't see that every day.

01:25:38.735 --> 01:25:42.159
I bet you 100
there's a toolkit in there.

01:25:42.383 --> 01:25:46.960
I don't wanna rain on
your crazy parade, buddy,

01:25:47.152 --> 01:25:50.063
but I don't think we can fix this thing.

01:26:26.352 --> 01:26:28.879
- A little more to the left, Al.
- Left.

01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:35.152
Yeah, that's it, right there. Right there.
We're dialed in, baby.

01:26:57.136 --> 01:26:58.640
- Hello.
- Hey, admiral.

01:26:58.864 --> 01:27:00.240
- Dirk?
- How you doing?

01:27:00.432 --> 01:27:03.056
Oh, Dirk, thank God,
Where the hell are you?

01:27:03.281 --> 01:27:07.056
Well, that's a damn good question.
Listen, I've got some bad news.

01:27:07.248 --> 01:27:09.456
Your buddy, Yves Massarde,
he's got an industrial factory

01:27:09.648 --> 01:27:11.825
that's dumping deadly toxins
into the Niger.

01:27:12.017 --> 01:27:15.056
- Massarde? Oh, Christ.
- I think he's got Eva at his plant.

01:27:15.248 --> 01:27:17.840
Which hopefully is gonna be
our next stop.

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:21.680
Well, I've got something for you.
Rudi's got chemistry here

01:27:21.872 --> 01:27:25.328
that says if that leak's not shut down
ASAP, it's gonna reach the ocean,

01:27:25.553 --> 01:27:29.329
When it does, that'll be ground zero
for the Atlantic's version of Chernobyl.

01:27:29.521 --> 01:27:30.929
- I get it.
- I've got something more,

01:27:31.153 --> 01:27:33.265
I've got word that Kazim
has mobilized his troops

01:27:33.488 --> 01:27:34.928
and is heading across the desert.

01:27:35.185 --> 01:27:37.328
We could use some serious muscle
here, admiral.

01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:39.761
Well, you're not gonna get it.
Not fast enough.

01:27:39.953 --> 01:27:42.320
I'm getting the D.C. two-step bigtime.

01:27:42.545 --> 01:27:44.497
- And this has to be done...
- Yesterday. I got it.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.289
Hey!

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.593
- Dirk?
- Yeah?

01:27:48.785 --> 01:27:50.672
I can't ask you boys to go this alone.

01:27:50.897 --> 01:27:53.105
Well, that's the great part, sir.

01:27:53.297 --> 01:27:54.929
You know you never have to.

01:28:09.009 --> 01:28:11.281
There is no more time, Modibo.

01:28:11.473 --> 01:28:14.705
Now is your chance to hit Kazim
where it really hurts.

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:17.393
We only have small arms.

01:28:17.585 --> 01:28:20.081
They are no use against concrete
and heavy machine guns.

01:28:20.497 --> 01:28:22.513
But you have power in numbers.

01:28:22.737 --> 01:28:25.617
We attack when he does not
expect it. We have to try.

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:29.490
Do you know what Kazim's war
with us has cost my people in lives?

01:28:29.682 --> 01:28:33.234
- In the poverty and disease it causes?
- Then come with us.

01:28:33.522 --> 01:28:34.609
And let's finish it.

01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:41.778
I cannot afford to have my men
slaughtered in a full-frontal attack.

01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:44.658
We cannot go with you.

01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:46.737
I understand.

01:28:48.849 --> 01:28:50.994
All right, we got another idea.

01:28:55.602 --> 01:28:57.842
Can I borrow your car?

01:29:15.922 --> 01:29:17.618
Kazim. Kazim!

01:29:28.018 --> 01:29:29.938
Had you going there, didn't we?

01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:31.282
You?

01:29:31.858 --> 01:29:33.234
Hi. How are you?

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:45.746
Zakara, go get the doctor.

01:29:50.323 --> 01:29:51.794
Move on ahead. Let's go.

01:29:57.874 --> 01:30:00.754
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, corporate retreat?

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:03.346
Go.

01:30:04.114 --> 01:30:07.987
Something's wrong here, Al.
This place is completely deserted.

01:30:17.235 --> 01:30:18.898
Modibo.

01:30:27.123 --> 01:30:28.051
Nobody home.

01:30:28.915 --> 01:30:30.322
- Hey, Al?
- Yeah.

01:30:30.547 --> 01:30:33.139
What would you do if you were about
to be exposed as the worst polluter

01:30:33.331 --> 01:30:34.611
of modern times?

01:30:34.803 --> 01:30:36.307
I don't know. Run for president?

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:38.931
- You'd hide the evidence, right?
- Yeah, right.

01:30:39.155 --> 01:30:40.563
How?

01:30:40.755 --> 01:30:42.867
How do you hide 50 tons
of industrial waste

01:30:43.059 --> 01:30:44.691
without anybody noticing it?

01:30:46.675 --> 01:30:48.115
You don't.

01:30:49.779 --> 01:30:53.939
- He's gonna blow the place, Al.
- That's not exactly subtle.

01:30:54.131 --> 01:30:55.955
That's what he's gonna do.

01:30:56.403 --> 01:30:58.899
That's why it's abandoned.
Make it look like an industrial accident,

01:30:59.123 --> 01:31:00.531
- And he walks.
- That's a good idea.

01:31:00.723 --> 01:31:02.739
- No, not really.
- Why?

01:31:02.963 --> 01:31:04.659
The toxins
would be sealed underground,

01:31:04.851 --> 01:31:07.347
and there would be no way
to contain them, Al.

01:31:07.571 --> 01:31:10.803
Look, to bring this place down, he'd
need 20 or 30 military-grade devices,

01:31:10.995 --> 01:31:13.268
all wired for simultaneous detonation.

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:17.300
It would never look like an accident.
Unless one centrally placed device

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:21.236
diverted all the plant's stored energy
into one massive explosion.

01:31:21.428 --> 01:31:22.931
- Which would look like an accident.
- Yes.

01:31:23.187 --> 01:31:24.884
Well, we gotta get that bomb, Al.

01:31:25.076 --> 01:31:27.443
No, I'll find the bomb,
you get the girl.

01:31:28.403 --> 01:31:29.332
Deal.

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.172
That's it.

01:31:50.099 --> 01:31:52.788
Got it. Bomb in a barrel.

01:32:08.596 --> 01:32:09.524
Come on.

01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:30.516
Get in. Get us out of here. Now!

01:32:30.708 --> 01:32:32.181
Come on, let's go!

01:32:45.621 --> 01:32:49.301
- Eva. Out, out, out!
- Don't shoot!

01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:53.460
- Back off. Back off! Move!
- Easy.

01:32:53.685 --> 01:32:55.605
I apologize, Mr. Pitt.

01:32:56.436 --> 01:32:58.965
- This is not what it appears.
- Did I miss something?

01:32:59.637 --> 01:33:01.428
I've seen your toxic dump.

01:33:01.908 --> 01:33:05.525
I've seen the sick Tuareg women
and kids, and I saw the dead in Asselar.

01:33:05.717 --> 01:33:07.188
- I leave something out?
- Dirk!

01:33:10.325 --> 01:33:12.693
Get this thing out of here, quick!
Stay here and don't move!

01:33:40.213 --> 01:33:41.141
Stop!

01:33:42.358 --> 01:33:43.798
Eva!

01:33:44.374 --> 01:33:47.446
Take us up 1,000 meters
and circle the plant.

01:34:02.902 --> 01:34:04.309
Remote system activated,

01:34:04.565 --> 01:34:07.510
All personnel, please move
to designated safety areas,

01:34:42.038 --> 01:34:43.414
Initiate mirror positioning,

01:35:43.351 --> 01:35:46.103
Temperature threshold, 10 percent,

01:36:06.103 --> 01:36:07.511
Come on. Come on.

01:36:51.255 --> 01:36:53.208
Commence incineration burn,

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:58.008
In five, four, three,

01:36:58.551 --> 01:37:00.471
two, one,

01:37:28.472 --> 01:37:30.648
Warning: Malfunction detected,

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:33.144
Initiate emergency shutdown,

01:37:33.336 --> 01:37:36.120
Thank you, and have a nice da...

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.680
Get us out of here, quick.

01:37:42.008 --> 01:37:43.321
Eva.

01:37:44.824 --> 01:37:47.128
How many times
am I gonna have to save your ass?

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.976
Well, in case you didn't notice,
I actually saved yours.

01:37:50.168 --> 01:37:51.160
I wasn't in any danger.

01:37:51.385 --> 01:37:53.977
- Oh, no?
- No, I'd have thought of something.

01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:55.256
Come here.

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:59.128
We gotta go.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.233
Hey, what's with the costumes?

01:38:15.577 --> 01:38:17.368
Uniforms? It's his idea.

01:38:18.105 --> 01:38:21.241
Hey, by the way, with this plan
of yours, do we have enough gas?

01:38:21.433 --> 01:38:23.800
Oh, stop being so negative, Al.

01:38:43.961 --> 01:38:45.849
- It's coming around on our 6.
- Yeah.

01:38:48.665 --> 01:38:51.513
It's Kazim.
Hey, maybe he wants his car back.

01:39:19.226 --> 01:39:21.689
Al, did you bring any of the explosives
from Massarde's?

01:39:21.945 --> 01:39:23.162
- Couldn't find them.
- Al.

01:39:23.354 --> 01:39:24.410
- I didn't have time.
- Al!

01:39:24.665 --> 01:39:26.042
Of course I brought the explosives!

01:39:26.234 --> 01:39:28.730
Eva, I hope you don't throw like a girl.

01:39:42.554 --> 01:39:43.994
He's coming around.

01:39:54.138 --> 01:39:56.058
Al, I need a door right now!

01:40:09.114 --> 01:40:10.810
Oh, my hat!

01:40:12.282 --> 01:40:13.562
Damn it!

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.739
Okay, here's the plan.

01:40:23.994 --> 01:40:26.778
Eva, get in the back seat
behind me. Go!

01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:27.898
- Al?
- Yeah.

01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:30.234
- Give her that bag of explosives.
- Gotcha!

01:40:30.426 --> 01:40:31.962
All right, hold on!

01:40:33.882 --> 01:40:34.810
Yeah.

01:40:37.210 --> 01:40:41.050
Eva, I need you to throw a bundle
of the dynamite into that hillside

01:40:41.274 --> 01:40:42.651
every time I say. Comprende?

01:40:42.843 --> 01:40:43.962
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:40:45.978 --> 01:40:47.034
I'm good!

01:40:50.970 --> 01:40:52.187
Now!

01:40:58.554 --> 01:41:01.179
Get us out. Move. Move!

01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:06.875
- Dirk, we need cover!
- I'm working on it!

01:41:24.091 --> 01:41:26.459
Oh, my God.

01:41:36.827 --> 01:41:39.004
Come on, Eva. Let's go, let's go.

01:41:39.964 --> 01:41:41.147
Come on!

01:41:46.171 --> 01:41:47.740
Move, move!

01:41:53.659 --> 01:41:55.739
Eva, help me dig.
Come on, let's go, let's go!

01:41:59.932 --> 01:42:01.019
- How we looking, Al?
- Great.

01:42:03.004 --> 01:42:04.348
Dig faster!

01:42:05.116 --> 01:42:06.172
Need a little help, Al.

01:42:14.011 --> 01:42:15.036
Go.

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.923
- Al?
- Yeah.

01:42:21.148 --> 01:42:23.676
You didn't see any extra fuel tanks
on that bird, did you?

01:42:23.899 --> 01:42:25.756
- No, I didn't see any.
- That means he only has

01:42:25.948 --> 01:42:27.355
20 to 30 minutes left
of flight time.

01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:30.940
These walls are about 2 feet thick
with a double-steel coating,

01:42:31.196 --> 01:42:35.324
so there's no way his bullets can get
to us. We just sit tight, wait him out.

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:36.604
Eva, down!

01:42:43.644 --> 01:42:45.820
- Say, Dirk?
- Yeah.

01:42:46.364 --> 01:42:48.828
You wanna talk me
through that again?

01:42:49.052 --> 01:42:51.836
- Armor-piercing rounds.
- Yeah.

01:42:52.284 --> 01:42:53.916
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:42:54.588 --> 01:42:55.516
I'm fine.

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.324
Hey, Al.

01:43:11.516 --> 01:43:12.860
- No, Dirk.
- Oh, yeah.

01:43:13.052 --> 01:43:14.333
No, it'll never work.

01:43:14.525 --> 01:43:16.956
- Why not?
- It's 150 years old.

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.461
But, Al, it's hardly ever been used.

01:43:18.653 --> 01:43:21.500
- It'll probably blow us to bits!
- Well, then at least we'll die fighting.

01:43:21.725 --> 01:43:24.029
- Yeah, that's comforting.
- We need to open that gun port.

01:43:24.221 --> 01:43:25.469
What the hell are we doing, guys?

01:43:29.981 --> 01:43:31.709
- I've gotta go outside.
- All right, go.

01:43:43.388 --> 01:43:44.893
Civil War piece of...

01:43:49.021 --> 01:43:50.333
That's it, Al.

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:06.845
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:44:07.773 --> 01:44:09.277
Next time, you go.

01:44:09.533 --> 01:44:10.941
- What the hell took you so long?
- What?

01:44:11.197 --> 01:44:12.477
- Hey, guys.
- I stopped for coffee.

01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:14.077
- Get a receipt?
- Yeah, I got a receipt.

01:44:14.301 --> 01:44:15.869
- I got you one too.
- You're the best, Al.

01:44:16.093 --> 01:44:18.558
You know what? I'll even get you
the money from Sandecker.

01:44:18.781 --> 01:44:20.637
- Guys!
- What?

01:44:23.613 --> 01:44:24.637
Oh, great.

01:44:25.758 --> 01:44:26.941
Now we're really in trouble.

01:44:27.966 --> 01:44:29.437
- Incoming!
- Down!

01:44:36.733 --> 01:44:37.950
Okay.

01:44:38.269 --> 01:44:40.189
If we bring down Kazim,
the army will surrender.

01:44:40.446 --> 01:44:42.013
- Cut the head off the snake...
- Body dies.

01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:44.541
Exactly. We're gonna need
cannonball, powder and fuses.

01:44:44.733 --> 01:44:47.262
- I'll get the cannonball.
- Eva, I need you to find the fuses.

01:44:47.486 --> 01:44:48.798
They're gonna be in a box this size.

01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:51.134
They look something
like carrot sticks. Go.

01:45:17.182 --> 01:45:18.590
- 150 yards!
- How you feeling, Al?

01:45:18.846 --> 01:45:20.094
- I got them!
- Good, good, good.

01:45:21.182 --> 01:45:22.302
Incoming!

01:45:43.006 --> 01:45:46.334
Jefferson Davis had how
many samples made?

01:45:49.118 --> 01:45:51.103
- Let's get that cannon out the porthole.
- Yeah.

01:45:52.414 --> 01:45:54.206
On the count of three,
we're gonna pull. Ready, Al?

01:45:54.398 --> 01:45:55.966
- Ready.
- One, two, three.

01:46:08.383 --> 01:46:09.759
- Yeah!
- That's it!

01:46:15.519 --> 01:46:17.055
- Bring me up 30 degrees, Al.
- Yeah.

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:21.919
Got it.

01:46:43.775 --> 01:46:46.303
I'm so tired of being shot at!

01:46:46.591 --> 01:46:49.503
Hold your positions.
Secure the area. I will finish this.

01:47:16.415 --> 01:47:17.375
Go! Go!

01:47:36.095 --> 01:47:37.120
No! Get it now!

01:47:38.144 --> 01:47:39.551
Get it out!

01:47:48.864 --> 01:47:49.824
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.168
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.248
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:59.360
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:48:14.112 --> 01:48:15.873
Look, look, look, look, look.

01:48:20.736 --> 01:48:22.656
Looks like you killed the snake.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:24.928
There's no way that

01:48:25.152 --> 01:48:28.000
- That should've worked, right?
- That should've worked.

01:49:25.249 --> 01:49:26.753
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:49:35.425 --> 01:49:37.249
Yeah!

01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:47.746
You know, from our point of view,
the great thing is, we capped the plant.

01:49:47.969 --> 01:49:49.282
The river's safe.

01:49:49.474 --> 01:49:52.162
And I also understand
the WHO is administering

01:49:52.354 --> 01:49:56.482
an antitoxin in the villages
formulated from Dr. Rojas' samples.

01:49:56.674 --> 01:49:58.913
- Better late than never.
- Absolutely.

01:49:59.137 --> 01:50:04.002
So I trust your work on
the Texas is going well?

01:50:04.258 --> 01:50:06.114
Giordino's on the job,
making sure everything

01:50:06.306 --> 01:50:08.034
gets where it's supposed to go,

01:50:08.226 --> 01:50:11.682
- All right!
- Say, probably not true,

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:16.513
but did I hear a rumor there's some
American gold onboard, on the Texas?

01:50:16.705 --> 01:50:19.105
Really? Be nice if it were true.

01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:22.690
No. I can assure you, there's no gold
there belonging to the U.S.

01:50:24.673 --> 01:50:27.042
Admiral, the administration
was highly impressed

01:50:27.266 --> 01:50:30.466
with the way you expedited
all the red tape down here.

01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:33.058
- They'd like to fold NUMA into...
- No, thanks.

01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:35.394
I'll never work in government again.

01:50:35.586 --> 01:50:37.954
Which is exactly what
they said you'd say.

01:50:38.690 --> 01:50:41.570
Look, they're offering full funding
in exchange for

01:50:41.794 --> 01:50:44.066
the occasional side job
for the good guys.

01:50:44.258 --> 01:50:47.330
- Who decides who the good guys are?
- You only do the jobs you want.

01:50:51.106 --> 01:50:53.474
- I need a new yacht.
- You got it.

01:50:54.467 --> 01:50:56.195
- And Rudi needs new computers.
- No, no, no.

01:50:56.387 --> 01:50:57.762
Done.

01:51:02.627 --> 01:51:04.482
There's one more thing.

01:51:15.042 --> 01:51:17.634
Negligence is a gray area
of the law, Yves.

01:51:17.858 --> 01:51:20.930
If the right people are approached
and handled in the right manner,

01:51:21.122 --> 01:51:23.747
I think we avoid
prosecution completely.

01:51:45.091 --> 01:51:49.347
Not bad, eh? You, me,
the bay of Monterey.

01:51:52.451 --> 01:51:53.827
You know, I was thinking.

01:51:54.499 --> 01:51:56.739
Remember that day in the desert?

01:51:56.931 --> 01:51:59.299
With the car, dynamite,

01:51:59.523 --> 01:52:02.083
Kazim's chasing us in the helicopter?

01:52:02.307 --> 01:52:04.195
Yeah?

01:52:04.387 --> 01:52:08.195
There's something I wanted to say
to you that I never got a chance to.

01:52:08.771 --> 01:52:10.243
What's that?

01:52:13.539 --> 01:52:15.700
You do throw like a girl.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:18.787
Hey! You do!
