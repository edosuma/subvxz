WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:06.881
Valentina.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.467
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.551 --> 00:12.721
I'm sorry, I thought we both wanted to.

00:14.931 --> 00:15.890
Valentina.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.602
Please forgive me, Valentina.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.939
We should've talked first,
or had a drink or something.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.316
Talk to me, please!

00:38.788 --> 00:40.415
Valentina. What is it?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.710
-What's the matter?
-I need to go.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.714
I'm in no hurry, okay?

00:47.797 --> 00:51.301
We can stay as many nights as you like.
Honestly.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.804
Please, just… What is it?

00:56.723 --> 00:57.557
Valentina.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.603
I don't get it, 30 minutes ago we wanted…

01:05.732 --> 01:08.902
It's as if I already knew him.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.653
I don't believe in destiny,

01:10.737 --> 01:13.865
but meeting again
in a city of over 20 million people?

01:13.948 --> 01:16.534
You thought
I'd just take your clothes off?

01:17.827 --> 01:20.288
Damn fate won't win this time.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.434
I want to die!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.132
You lie to us in Cancún,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.802
disappear and then come back
with some crazy story.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.637
How do we know it's not a trap?

02:18.304 --> 02:19.472
This wasn't the plan.

02:20.223 --> 02:24.394
I wanted to phone you from another country
to tell you who our father is.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.020
It's hard to believe you.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.774
Read my body language, witch.
I'm telling you the truth.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.735
-Why did he try to kill you?
-It doesn't add up.

02:32.819 --> 02:37.323
I demanded $200,000 to keep the secret
about me being his daughter.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.993
The bastard had other plans, of course.

02:40.076 --> 02:44.038
He said to pick up the cash
at his place and I stupidly did.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.962
The last thing I remember
is feeling I won big.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.632
Then I woke up in a freaking nightmare.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.451
I lost my phone and your numbers.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.872
You only needed us when you were scared,
you shameless brat.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.166
I had enough cash to go elsewhere.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.002
So why did you return?

04:54.085 --> 04:56.838
Because if he can kill his own kid…

04:56.921 --> 04:59.382
He'll shut anyone up to protect himself.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.012
Caridad!

05:13.730 --> 05:14.564
Valentina!

05:18.526 --> 05:20.153
Valentina, please talk to me.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.997
What does Federico have to do with it?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.249
Is Federico Marroquín involved?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.294
-Tell me the truth.
-Does he know who you are?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.172
Answer me, Manny.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.091
No.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.011
I used him to get close to the family.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.015
He barely gets along with his dad.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.060
Who is Federico Marroquín?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.144
My cousin.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.064
And half brother.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.816
Our half brother.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.943
Why do you know him?

06:04.155 --> 06:07.867
FEDERICO: I NEED AN EXPLANATION.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.083
Is he the Federico with no last name?

06:18.920 --> 06:19.879
What?

06:28.304 --> 06:29.680
-Did you guys…
-No!

06:34.602 --> 06:36.229
He won't stop calling.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.110
You need to tell him something.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.114
Anything but the truth.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.658
"There's nothing to explain.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.202
Please don't look for me. Bye, Federico."

06:52.328 --> 06:56.374
Chicks don't even understand themselves.
That's the truth, dude.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.584
Women say so, not me.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.378
But you agree something happened?

07:02.505 --> 07:03.339
Yes.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.677
But I wouldn't bother trying
to find out what it is.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.720
She'll call you in a few days.

07:12.932 --> 07:13.766
Is it her?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.853
No. It's Manny's mom.

07:19.021 --> 07:24.110
That thing about your cousin
being a bartender,

07:25.486 --> 07:30.283
is that some kind of code you guys have
that means something else?

07:30.366 --> 07:33.619
A code? What do you mean?

07:33.703 --> 07:36.038
No way. You really know nothing?

07:36.789 --> 07:37.665
Nothing.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.503
When I showed Simón the birthmark,
he wasn't expecting it.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.382
He'd do the same thing to us
if he knew about us.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.845
He didn't see me sleeping in the car.
That saved me.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.805
But he let your mom die.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.226
Why would he do that
if he didn't know he had a kid?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.896
For the same reason
he killed Matilde's mom.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.982
To silence her.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.319
Just like he silenced Alice.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.114
The Marroquín foundation
owns the hospital she's at.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.284
Eloisa Santisteban was Simón's mother.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.578
It's in your PA's e-mail.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.666
If Manny's right, then Simón,
or someone who knew about her,

08:20.750 --> 08:22.627
is involved with the overdose.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.712
Simón's a psychopath.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.508
His MO is clearly drugging women.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.010
I refuse to accept that my mom is dead.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.972
That makes more sense, singer,
than avoiding you for years.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.934
Who mailed me all those postcards?

08:38.684 --> 08:41.103
So who was Mamá Ela talking to?

08:41.187 --> 08:46.567
It could've been anybody, the guy clearly
has people to help him with his…

08:47.401 --> 08:48.611
dirty work.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.991
And if your family knew Dominga was alive,
you'd never report her missing.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.039
She's acting weird, Claudio.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.085
She barely spoke to me today.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.797
What if you back off a little?

09:08.839 --> 09:14.011
Stop meddling in her life all the time.
She'll tell you herself if she wants to.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.267
Hey.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.565
Isn't it high time
she knew who her dad is?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.986
Can't we send her the information,
but not directly from you?

09:41.831 --> 09:42.665
No.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.128
I know Simón Marroquín.

09:48.504 --> 09:52.592
Matilde and her sisters will be safer
if they never find out, right?

09:55.136 --> 09:57.680
We'd be safe if I hadn't found out.

09:57.763 --> 10:01.517
I told you guys to leave it at that,
but you just kept going.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.270
Is it our fault you wanted to get rich?

10:04.353 --> 10:07.982
We need to decide what to do
with what we know.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.820
First, I'll contact my mom.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.324
Of all five of them,
only she's alive and sane.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.244
Simón's waiting for me to show up
to kill her.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.296
There's always someone, 24/7.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.890
What if we go public with it?

10:40.973 --> 10:45.061
Say we're his bastards?
They'd praise him in this sexist country.

10:46.729 --> 10:51.484
With no proof, it's the word of five women
against the next Justice Minister.

10:51.567 --> 10:55.029
And our moms,
the bitches who tried to con him.

10:55.112 --> 10:59.992
Simón would beat his chest in public
and they'd name him minister on the spot.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.786
And president in three years.

11:01.869 --> 11:06.540
So, what do we do?
Keep quiet and hide or what?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.793
-That's not fair.
-No.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.712
We have to use the fact
that Simón doesn't know we exist.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.676
Make him pay for everything he did.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.178
I have a plan.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.393
Mom!

12:10.146 --> 12:11.063
Mom!

12:16.444 --> 12:19.697
If you want hot water,
you need to wake up early.

12:20.281 --> 12:24.410
Breakfast is at 8:00
and the kids come first.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.580
Nun…

12:27.663 --> 12:31.917
Manny, quit calling me nun.
My name is Caridad.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.254
I don't call you table dancer, do I?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.966
I just wanted to thank you.

12:45.097 --> 12:45.931
Nun.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.361
Have some chamomile tea.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.157
Both of us need it.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.706
I can't believe I almost had sex…

13:11.832 --> 13:13.125
with my brother!

13:15.461 --> 13:18.339
Now we know why fate prevented it.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.423
Fate?

13:22.301 --> 13:25.095
It was fate that supposedly
got us together.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.475
Sometimes the reasons
aren't revealed until later.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.436
Sometimes never.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.482
What if it's a trap?

13:37.858 --> 13:39.944
What if we didn't meet randomly?

13:41.195 --> 13:44.448
And he tried to have sex
with his own sister?

13:44.532 --> 13:47.368
He's a psychopath's kid, Bautista!

13:47.451 --> 13:49.203
And so are we.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.292
Maybe Manny is right
and he's as misled as we are.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.460
No. I don't know.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.964
I'm not so sure he's innocent.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.345
What does your heart say?

14:11.100 --> 14:14.353
My heart said there were no secrets
between Mom and me.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.983
I can't believe a word that bastard says.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
Where do I always have you, honey?

14:31.662 --> 14:34.707
In your heart, and you're in mine.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.371
Your sister left the convent.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.458
She didn't move to the North Pole.

15:21.211 --> 15:24.006
I know, Pocho, but I'm still worried.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.719
Enough to run out after the show?

15:31.263 --> 15:32.598
Caridad needed me.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.362
You're a guy. You don't get it.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.544
There he is.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.510
I just need a couple of signatures,
that's all.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.471
I'm fine.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.974
Thanks for asking.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.061
How are you?

16:19.144 --> 16:21.689
Bad people live forever.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.650
You still have
your charming sense of humor.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.027
Which I didn't get from you.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.905
How are you, little brother?

16:29.989 --> 16:35.452
Fine, they're just a formality,
nothing important.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.041
You're leaving the foundation?

16:42.835 --> 16:47.131
With Simón's new position,
the foundation could be audited.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.799
It's to protect the trustees.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.720
Man, he can be so grim!

16:55.014 --> 16:57.016
No wonder you're a great lawyer.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.228
It's a value I don't expect
a party animal to grasp.

17:02.980 --> 17:07.234
Just sign it, you clown.
I give you my word it's all kosher.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.485
Your word?

17:09.403 --> 17:12.364
You haven't lost Dad's sense of humor.
Have you?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.994
Family, family!

17:18.454 --> 17:19.955
A deputy!

17:20.581 --> 17:24.668
My friend says it was a score-settling.
Apparently, Manny owed him money.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.213
Maybe she wanted to get out
of that kind of life,

17:28.297 --> 17:29.757
as her friend Nina said.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.259
But why would she sneak out?

17:33.719 --> 17:34.553
I don't know.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.515
Nobody understands women.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.559
You should've told me, Aunt.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.479
Yes, I was going to tell you
on the phone last night…

17:46.440 --> 17:48.442
I have to go.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.902
I'll go with you.

17:49.985 --> 17:53.072
I go to the market every day
to clear my head.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.491
A girl did this to you?

17:56.116 --> 18:00.370
Yes, she walked out on me
without explaining why.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.915
She must have her reasons.

18:02.998 --> 18:07.127
Sometimes it's much better not to know.
Trust me, Fede.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.582
This is Pérez.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.460
Federico left.
The lady's off to the market.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.130
Okay.

19:05.018 --> 19:05.936
Hi, Susana.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.689
Don't look. They're watching you.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.527
A gray car is always parked
in front of your condo.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.613
Manny hasn't contacted you
because of that.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.574
-How is she?
-Don't look at me.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.202
Manny is okay.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.790
She'll call you at this number.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.710
Act normal and please,
not a word to anyone.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.255
Not Simón or anyone. Do it for her.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.203
She gave it to her
and returned to the convent.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.748
Great, now let's hope
Susana gives her daughter a chance.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.213
If Manny's in trouble,
she might try to trick you.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.216
Like making crazy things up to scare you.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.844
-Manny wouldn't do that.
-She would if she's threatened.

20:30.145 --> 20:30.979
Yes?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.940
Simón, it's Susana.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.652
I fear Manny was kidnapped
and they want money.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.075
I never got the thing about
asking statues for favors.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.370
Does it work?

20:52.626 --> 20:53.877
It's not the statue.

20:55.879 --> 20:56.797
It's faith.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.341
Your faith.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.887
Having faith is tough
if you're screwed over from birth.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.431
Aren't you curious?

21:08.141 --> 21:09.601
About your aunt, your family?

21:13.146 --> 21:16.316
I thought she was a snob
who didn't care about her sister.

21:17.651 --> 21:21.863
That's how I explained why she had it all
and we were so miserable.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.995
Ask your statue to stop Mom
from telling Simón.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.956
Or else our plan is screwed.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.667
Or my mom ends up dead.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.589
Trust her, Manny. She's your mom.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.719
She still loves him.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.390
I've been in trouble before
and she betrayed me.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.648
I fear Manny's been kidnapped
and they want money.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.944
We suppose the honorable Justice Minister

22:01.737 --> 22:04.323
screwed his pregnant wife's sister.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.462
-Has anyone phoned you?
-No, but…

22:18.545 --> 22:21.757
Susana, has Manny contacted you
in any way?

22:28.430 --> 22:30.098
Simón, I'll call you back.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.150
-Hello.
-Mom, it's me.

22:41.068 --> 22:45.489
-Thank God! Where are you?
-I'll explain later. Listen carefully.

22:46.823 --> 22:50.202
Why are you calling this phone?
Who is that nun?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.706
Simón tried to kill me.

22:58.126 --> 22:58.960
Simón?

22:59.711 --> 23:02.798
I found your letter in the trash.
I know I'm his daughter.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.175
Manny!

23:07.719 --> 23:09.179
I tried to blackmail him.

23:10.847 --> 23:13.183
Honey, if someone's forcing you to say…

23:13.266 --> 23:14.684
Nobody's forcing me.

23:14.768 --> 23:18.188
I asked him for $200,000
to keep quiet about being his kid,

23:18.271 --> 23:20.440
but he tried to kill me instead.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.735
He withdrew $200,000 from the bank
without telling me.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.908
Mom, I need you to do exactly
what I'm about to say.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.122
Damn it!

24:28.508 --> 24:29.885
Where are we going?

24:29.968 --> 24:33.096
After you swear you said nothing
to Simón Marroquín.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.723
I swear I said nothing.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.059
Where are we going? Manny told me nothing.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.936
She'll tell you, don't worry.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.231
Let's go, please.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.537
That damn place has no cameras.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.874
She used another exit.
I would've seen her.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.126
-You searched the block?
-Yes.

25:03.210 --> 25:07.964
Keep looking, we'd better find her,
or the boss will rip your head off.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.550
-Move it.
-Yes, sir.

25:21.895 --> 25:25.565
-Where's my daughter?
-On her way. Please sit down, Susana.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.613
Want some tea?

25:32.447 --> 25:35.325
Who are you?
What have you got to do with Manny?

25:37.244 --> 25:40.163
Tell me, or I'll go and call the cops.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.499
We are her sisters.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.084
You take me for a fool?

25:44.167 --> 25:46.795
-Half sisters.
-On her father's side.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.140
So, who do I kill first?

26:55.822 --> 26:57.616
Get out. You're fired.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.130
Manny contacted her.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.256
How do you know?

27:14.466 --> 27:17.552
Yesterday, Susana said she thought
she was kidnapped.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.892
Then who knows what happened,
she said she'd call me back, and…

27:24.601 --> 27:26.645
That damn girl contacted her!

27:27.854 --> 27:30.357
If she saw her daughter,
then she knows everything.

27:31.399 --> 27:32.942
What do you think she'll do?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.736
What the hell do I know?

27:36.988 --> 27:38.031
You know her.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.993
Do you think she'd go to the cops?

27:42.702 --> 27:43.536
No.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.415
No, she'd have a lot to explain and…

27:48.375 --> 27:50.460
she'd be exposing her own kid.

27:50.543 --> 27:54.589
Take a risk and call her.
Let her decide who to believe.

27:54.673 --> 28:00.428
You, who've done nothing but help her,
or her, who only lets her down.

28:09.562 --> 28:12.357
WOMAN OF COURAGE

28:12.440 --> 28:13.775
You designed it yourself?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.654
Yes, the program I use
isn't that complicated.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.699
But you need to have some talent.

28:21.908 --> 28:25.120
The same girl inspired you.
When will I meet her?

28:29.082 --> 28:32.669
No way, Fede! No! She dumped you?

28:34.963 --> 28:37.841
You're kidding.
What happened in three days?

28:39.426 --> 28:41.344
Not knowing why is the worst part.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.805
We said we'd meet at a hotel,

28:43.888 --> 28:46.433
so I got a suite
with champagne and flowers.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.270
She was so happy
when I phoned her from the car.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.816
But when I got there,
she looked like she saw a ghost.

28:55.650 --> 28:59.487
Then she ran out sobbing
without so much as an explanation.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.283
Then she texted me to leave her alone.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.622
-Just like that?
-Yes.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.626
So it happened
between my call and my arrival.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.713
Looks like she's scared to tell me.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.300
Whatever it is,

29:21.050 --> 29:23.470
she preferred to keep quiet
and let you hate her.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.515
Women only do that to protect you.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.685
Protect me from what?

29:31.895 --> 29:32.812
That I don't know.

29:33.855 --> 29:38.526
But if I were you, I wouldn't give up.
I'd try to find out.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.196
Okay. Let's play.

29:42.697 --> 29:46.451
-You want to lose again?
-We'll see about that. Take a good look.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.370
Here we go.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.123
Man!

29:53.041 --> 29:54.417
This is a nightmare.

29:55.668 --> 29:58.213
And all these years I thought he and I…

29:59.798 --> 30:01.132
What a bastard!

30:01.216 --> 30:03.968
You're not the only one he fooled.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.970
At least they didn't kill you.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.349
Valentina's mom escaped
because she died of cancer.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.063
If Simón is behind
what happened to your moms,

30:15.146 --> 30:17.857
I'll warn my sister he's a killer.

30:17.941 --> 30:22.111
No, that's very dangerous.
Not knowing anything keeps her safe.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.198
Why did you name Manny "Juana"?

30:25.281 --> 30:26.699
It's my mom's name. Why?

30:26.783 --> 30:29.452
I was named after Pope Joan, a Tarot card.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.956
Me, after Juana Inés de la Cruz,
Mom's favorite writer.

30:33.039 --> 30:36.251
Juana la Cubana,
a famous singer from the '30s.

30:36.334 --> 30:39.254
I was named after Joan of Arc.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.297
So you're all named Juana?

30:41.381 --> 30:44.050
It's no coincidence,
just like the birthmark.

30:44.133 --> 30:48.012
It was the Universe's way to ensure
we'd meet at the right time.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.318
Simón!

31:02.402 --> 31:04.571
The right time for what?

31:08.199 --> 31:10.535
For Simón to pay for what he did.

31:10.618 --> 31:11.452
What's wrong?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.414
Susana, what's the matter?

31:16.207 --> 31:19.002
Mom. You have to help us.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.880
She's dead!

31:23.339 --> 31:25.675
My God! She's dead!

31:25.758 --> 31:30.096
My Manny is dead! No!

31:34.225 --> 31:36.561
We'll make him pay for everything he did.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.190
