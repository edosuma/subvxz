WEBVTT

00:40.749 --> 00:45.336
I know you said to call at night,
but, uh , I haven't been alone.

00:45.421 --> 00:49.590
I understand. I have a moment.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.134
So how is she?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.928
Well, it's only been a short period
in therapeutic time.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.138
But she's making progress?

00:55.222 --> 00:58.850
She's not particularly forthcoming yet.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.601
What has she been talking about?

01:00.686 --> 01:03.896
Mostly, she seems consumed
with petty jealousies

01:03.981 --> 01:06.566
and overwhelmed
with everyday activities.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.026
Basically, we're dealing with
the emotions of a child here.

01:11.155 --> 01:12.947
She wasn't always like this.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.534
Well, we're finding that this kind of anxiety
is not uncommon in housewives.

01:16.660 --> 01:21.038
And let's not forget, the death of a parent
is extremely destabilizing.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.540
So that's it.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.792
Well, that's the beginning, certainly.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.794
As she becomes more
forthcoming, we may be able

01:26.879 --> 01:29.630
to shed some light on the deeper issues
as she talks more.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.550
- There are deeper issues?
-Usually.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.970
These are not groundbreaking
revelations, Mr. Draper.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.972
I'm concerned , obviously.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.975
Of course. We both are.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.811
Time and talk, That's what I
recommend right now.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.813
And again , evenings are better for me.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.982
Well, I appreciate your time.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.406
Mona, I am drinking my milk right now.

01:57.743 --> 02:02.789
Go to M im's. Bring the heiress.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.583
The Montclair air might
wipe the scowl off her face.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.252
Knock, knock.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.838
Call me from there.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.384
I'll try to make it out by Sunday afternoon.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.386
I just got off the phone with U FC,

02:17.471 --> 02:21.098
and they're having the N ixon boys
stop by at the end of the week.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.017
- With N ixon?
- No, thank God .

02:23.101 --> 02:27.647
Otherwise, I'd have to move the piano
out of my office.

02:29.107 --> 02:33.027
Hopefully, he'll decide he needs us.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.738
Well, the ones with the best product
make the worst clients.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.074
Stop smoking so much .

02:38.158 --> 02:40.827
It's a sign of weakness.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.578
You know how H itler
got Neville Chamberlain

02:42.663 --> 02:44.914
to give him everything at Munich?

02:44.998 --> 02:49.418
He held the conference
at an old palace that forbid smoking .

02:49.503 --> 02:52.338
And after an hour and a half
of not smoking ,

02:52.464 --> 02:57.260
Neville Chamberlain would have given Hitler
his mother as a dance partner.

02:57.344 --> 03:01.305
All I can get from this story
is that Hitler didn't smoke.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.808
And I do.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.853
Good night, peanut.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.451
Last one to Chumley's gets
to wheel Kenneth Cosgrove,

03:22.536 --> 03:25.788
published author, home in a baby carriage.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.351
- Hello there.
- Good news.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.729
Mona and Margaret are going out of town
for the weekend .

03:49.813 --> 03:51.647
Mona's mother fell down the steps.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.400
- You're really blessed ,
- Come on over.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.861
I'll put on my whites,
We'll pretend it's V.J . Day.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.741
What goes in there, an aspirin?

04:01.825 --> 04:04.660
I suppose I could have taken a suitcase
anywhere this weekend .

04:04.745 --> 04:06.537
And I don't mean your apartment.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.665
I got us a couple of sandwiches,
and filled a thermos for the train .

04:09.750 --> 04:12.960
Mr. Sterling , this is Carol , my roommate.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.338
Nice to meet you , Carol.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.840
Miss Holloway, I have
an accounting question .

04:22.554 --> 04:27.141
We will go away. Not tonight,
but some weekend coming up.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.143
Puerto Rico?

04:29.227 --> 04:32.188
I don't care if it's Cuba,
I need a little notice.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.232
You've got a lot of rules, Red .

04:37.986 --> 04:39.987
Be good , girls.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.866
I don't mind you staying
late, just as long as you're not trying

04:43.951 --> 04:46.369
- to milk us for the dinner money.
- It's work.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.870
Just because tomorrow's Friday
doesn't mean I expect

04:47.955 --> 04:50.164
to be pulling your head
off the keys in the morning .

04:50.248 --> 04:52.166
What are you doing tonight?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.585
Uh , working and going home.

04:54.670 --> 05:00.549
I'll let you enjoy that one, honey,
but I was talking to Donald here.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.053
- I'm on the 5:31 .
- Reservations at home.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.514
I've had those. Easiest ones to break.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.684
Besides, they love it when
you keep them guessing . It adds spice.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.143
Trying to get me in trouble?
Betty's cooking .

05:11.228 --> 05:13.104
One drink. You owe me that.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.399
- Did I miss something?
- No.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.192
Don and I talk all the time
when you're not around .

05:18.276 --> 05:19.860
In fact, we're gonna do it right now.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.278
Don? Shall we?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.823
- Well, good night, boys.
- Good night, Paul.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.282
I love doing that.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.706
You seem like a busy little girl.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.457
Draper pushing you around enough?

05:33.542 --> 05:34.875
What does that mean?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.628
Burning the midnight oil
is not good for your skin .

05:37.713 --> 05:39.672
Oh , no, it's--

05:39.756 --> 05:42.008
It's for something else.
I'm working on copy.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.801
On your own?

05:43.885 --> 05:47.680
Mr. Rumsen liked what I did
in the brainstorming thingy.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.557
Sanitary napkins?

05:49.641 --> 05:51.809
- No. Lipstick.
- What did I say?

05:51.893 --> 05:54.311
It's the Belle Jolie account.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.231
M r. Campbell, your wife
called from the Four Seasons.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.192
- They've been seated .
- Thank you , H ildy.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.531
Want me to take a look at it?
I do it for a lot of the fellows.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.450
Really?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.160
Yeah . Really.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.245
That would be super.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.330
Well , we're all in it together.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.342
Two!

06:30.348 --> 06:34.894
So they fired all the guys in the middle
and moved up their mail room staff,

06:34.978 --> 06:37.396
right before all the salaries got expensive.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.981
Smart.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.067
Is that what we're gonna do?

06:42.527 --> 06:45.154
We're not going to do anything .

06:50.368 --> 06:53.746
At a certain age, they lose that.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.289
What?

06:55.373 --> 06:58.793
That glow of pure youth .

06:58.877 --> 07:01.378
It's like they hit 30,
and somebody puts out a light.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.426
I don't think those two
have 30 years between them .

07:07.511 --> 07:09.678
Polka dots looks like a lot of fun .

07:11.598 --> 07:14.058
Yeah, you'll have to let me know.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.603
Jesus, you must be starving .

07:17.687 --> 07:20.147
I know I am . What's Betty making?

07:20.232 --> 07:22.483
I don't know.

07:22.567 --> 07:26.153
Mona hasn't cooked since
Margaret stopped eating .

07:26.238 --> 07:28.823
They're fighting it out.
I'm the one that gets hurt.

07:33.537 --> 07:37.331
I'll call Betty. Tell her we'll be three.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.708
No!

07:39.793 --> 07:42.586
- You sure?
- Are you kidding?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.421
She'll be thrilled .

07:44.506 --> 07:46.799
When's the last time she saw you?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.926
We'll take my car.
Save you train fare.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.446
- My eyes are burning .
- That's impossible.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.949
That better not be Daddy
saying he's going to be late.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.786
Don't do gymnastics in the house.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.375
Draper residence.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.169
You are coming home, right?

08:23.253 --> 08:25.588
Yes. I'm coming home.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.133
U nfortunately, Roger has decided
he needs a home-cooked meal.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.302
You're kidding .

08:31.386 --> 08:33.137
I don't know if I have enough food .

08:33.221 --> 08:35.472
Birdie, what do you put in
that freezer I bought you?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.058
Frozen food .

08:38.143 --> 08:40.227
What do you want me to say?

08:54.492 --> 08:56.368
Betty, this steak--

08:56.453 --> 08:58.412
You sure you don't want some?

08:58.496 --> 09:01.415
No, thank you , Roger.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.584
I'm a vegetarian sometimes.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.045
Mona has a little calorie book
she keeps on the refrigerator.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.714
Always has her nose in there.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.424
Maybe she wants
to look good for you .

09:10.508 --> 09:13.260
Isn't that a nice thought?

09:13.345 --> 09:16.430
I was pudgy as a girl, if you can believe it.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.015
I came into Home Ec in the 8th grade

09:18.099 --> 09:19.433
with a pattern for big girl pajamas.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.436
The teacher asked who I was
making the pajamas for.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.814
I didn't realize how much
weight I'd lost that summer.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.025
Swim camp, I guess.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.194
I went from Tadpole to Polliwog that year.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.655
Sounds like a lateral move.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.907
When I was little, in the summer
we used to swim at night.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.284
In a pool , not the ocean .

09:37.369 --> 09:38.410
Warm air,

09:38.495 --> 09:40.454
light dancing in the blue--

09:40.538 --> 09:43.624
N ight swimming . It's divine.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.542
Sometimes naked .

09:45.627 --> 09:49.463
Believe me, on those nights,
it was very difficult to go to sleep.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.340
You ever experienced that, Don?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.717
Trouble sleeping? Never.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.928
Your husband's a funny son of a bitch ,
you know that, Betty?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.638
Yeah .

09:57.722 --> 09:59.556
We used to swim in a quarry.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.477
By the way you drop your G's
every once in a while,

10:03.561 --> 10:05.854
I always thought
you were raised on a farm .

10:05.939 --> 10:08.148
Someplace with a swimmin' hole.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.115
What do you say we go
to a commercial break. . .

10:16.199 --> 10:18.409
brought to you by more liquor?

10:21.162 --> 10:22.997
You two.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.461
Oh , Jesus, don't tell me
it's your anniversary.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.005
- No,
- Don't worry.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.549
Sally got this frosting machine.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.634
Oh . "Mommy and Daddy."

10:35.719 --> 10:37.511
Simple, to the point, colloquial .

10:37.595 --> 10:39.930
She writes like her father.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.648
I'll get hers. You get your own.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.275
Three on a match .

10:53.611 --> 10:55.529
Never understood that.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.823
Is that like three on a horse?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.534
Trench war. First war.

11:00.618 --> 11:04.538
They used to say,
"First man lights up, they notice you .

11:04.622 --> 11:05.956
"Second man, Jerry takes aim .

11:06.041 --> 11:08.125
Third one-- Auf wiedersehen. "

11:08.209 --> 11:10.544
But the professional wisdom
says that one of our guys

11:10.628 --> 11:12.546
came up with that,
as a way to sell matches.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.174
You tell your kids there's no Santa Claus?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.593
He'd never do that.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.847
Tell us another story.
A true one, though .

11:23.808 --> 11:28.479
Well, my father was in the trenches.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.272
With a bayonet.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.275
Think about that.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.362
Poking a man to death
three feet away from you .

11:37.697 --> 11:40.616
What does that sound like?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.576
Don never talks about the war.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.828
The war? His war, you mean .

11:44.913 --> 11:47.581
Not much to say.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.583
You boys used up all the glory.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.169
We did , didn't we?

11:52.253 --> 11:56.757
'Course, my old man will always
have one on me with that bayonet.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.343
My biggest hit came
when we were running oil

11:59.427 --> 12:01.428
down to the islands
in the South China Sea.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.264
The Pacific was all about gasoline.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.100
People forget that.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.311
You know what?
I don't like to talk about it, either.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.526
Oh , dear. I'm sorry.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.610
Not much .

12:16.694 --> 12:19.696
Now you have to tell us.

12:21.866 --> 12:26.620
Well, the third day we picked up
a Dinah circling the convoy.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.580
A recon plane.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.708
They were mapping us for the N ip suicide
submarines up ahead--

12:31.793 --> 12:36.422
kaitens--basically, warheads with motors.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.882
Made us feel good to know we had
such a dedicated enemy.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.717
That's one way of thinking about it.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.889
Maybe I was bored , but I thought,
We should get that little plane.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.808
Bored? What about scared?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.643
That never comes in to these stories.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.728
You're making me look bad
in front of the lady.

12:51.813 --> 12:55.065
That's impossible. Finish your story.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.444
Well , we gave it to 'em .

12:58.528 --> 13:01.321
Right at 1 2:00.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.240
He was going away from us,
but we hit him .

13:03.324 --> 13:06.160
I watched him dive into the waves
just beyond the horizon .

13:06.244 --> 13:10.289
It was strange, because
we knew it was over for him ,

13:10.373 --> 13:12.666
but we didn't see or hear much.

13:12.750 --> 13:17.171
The next four hours,
I took us off course, just to swing by.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.840
Looking for a hole
in the ocean , I guess.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.760
We saw the wreckage,
No chute, no body.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.725
It's incredible that something
that heavy can float.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.686
Isn't that something?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.898
- Bet they gave you a medal .
- They did .

13:35.982 --> 13:37.441
But not for that. It was for drinking .

13:39.235 --> 13:41.069
Can something be done
about this sadness?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.863
Want to switch to gin?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.576
Did you check the golf bag?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.787
I have something out in the garage
left over from New Year's.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.958
I don't care if it has ants in it.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.628
Roger, please, the kids.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.601
Sally will be happy
her cake was such a hit.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.895
Make sure you tell her

14:14.979 --> 14:17.731
I ate the "M" in "Mom ."

14:17.815 --> 14:20.734
- Roger--
- I can't believe you've had two babies.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.738
Don't do that.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.407
You've been making eyes at me all night.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.826
You can't tell me that I'm
not giving you hot pants.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.288
You smell so good .

14:35.708 --> 14:37.834
I can make more coffee.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.337
I just want you to know
that when I go to sleep tonight,

14:40.421 --> 14:42.005
I will be thinking all about you .

14:56.229 --> 14:59.606
Where'd you go, to Russia to get that?

14:59.691 --> 15:01.858
No, I ran down the street
knocking on doors.

15:09.867 --> 15:13.203
Come on, you two. Come on out here
and wish me a bon voyage.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.834
I was just saying
what a lucky man you are.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.295
Beautiful children . Enjoy it.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.798
One minute you're drinking at a bar,

15:24.882 --> 15:26.800
and they come and tell you
your kid's been born,

15:26.884 --> 15:28.885
next thing you know,
they're heading off to college.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.812
Well , I should be on my way.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.897
I'll take this for the road .

15:41.899 --> 15:43.567
I'll walk you out.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.410
Magical night.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.881
That's my car.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.301
There you go.

16:11.763 --> 16:12.929
Lights!

16:27.654 --> 16:30.947
- What was that?
- What?

16:31.032 --> 16:33.200
That. Him .

16:33.284 --> 16:37.037
Felt like someone turned the oven on
when I came back in here with that bottle.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.414
- That's ridiculous.
- Bullshit.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.166
Nothing happened , Don .

16:41.250 --> 16:43.877
Other than your drunk boss
ruining our evening.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.879
Can we leave it at that?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.964
You seemed to be having a grand time.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.885
I liked the wine.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.553
You made a fool of yourself.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.722
Why would you say that?

16:55.807 --> 16:58.058
You were throwing yourself at him .
Giggling at his stories.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.477
I was being friendly. He's your boss.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.146
I don't like to be treated that way
in my own home.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.108
I know what I saw.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.071
You want to bounce me off the walls?

17:12.740 --> 17:15.283
Would that make you feel better?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.835
Sometimes I feel like
I'm living with a little girl .

17:36.764 --> 17:38.515
Humps, where were you last night?

17:38.599 --> 17:44.521
I had a dinner with my in-laws
at the Four Seasons-- poolside.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.940
Sounds refreshing .

17:47.024 --> 17:49.109
Norman Mailer, Mayor Wagner.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.903
The naked and the dead .

17:51.988 --> 17:54.364
- What's in the box?
- It's a wedding present.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.867
- We got two.
- But what is it?

17:56.951 --> 17:59.369
- It's a Chip 'n' Dip.
- Let me see.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.912
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.497
I'm might have to go
to somebody else's wedding .

18:02.582 --> 18:04.040
I like to know what people are returning .

18:10.923 --> 18:12.716
What?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.718
I don't know what to say.
You got two of these?

18:14.802 --> 18:17.220
- What is it?
- You have your fingers in your ears?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.723
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.
You have your friends over.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.267
You put chips on the sides
and dip in the middle.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.771
- Dip?
- Yes.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.647
We went to these peoples' house,
and they had one.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.984
It had sour cream with these
little brown onions in it.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.360
It was very good .

18:32.445 --> 18:34.946
You'll have to give me
that recipe sometime.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.157
Cost 22 bucks.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.242
- Shit!
- So.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.994
I'm going to return it.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.830
Today? Freddy Rumsen's
cousin works at General Mills.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.499
We're all going to Ratazzi's for lunch .

18:45.583 --> 18:48.001
- Maybe dinner,
- No.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.880
- I have to return this thing ,
- "Today," she said, I'm sure.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.632
I like doing things for her.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.175
You're right. I'm sorry.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.011
When you finish shopping,
come join us.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.097
I hear they make a great
Grasshopper, Mildred .

19:10.107 --> 19:12.776
Mr. Draper? Mr. Sterling to see you .

19:22.119 --> 19:24.538
Send him in .

19:29.126 --> 19:30.752
Something for the golf bag .

19:32.129 --> 19:33.129
That's the good stuff.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.051
I take it you got home in one piece.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.847
I made it as far as the Knights Inn
off the Taconic.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.225
I know that place.
It's got great water pressure.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.061
Yeah , I slept in the car.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.354
About last night.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.148
What about it?

19:54.902 --> 19:57.070
When a man gets to the point
when his name's on the building ,

19:57.154 --> 19:59.823
he can get an unnatural
sense of entitlement.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.533
What does that mean , Roger?

20:01.617 --> 20:04.119
You're not gonna make this easy.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.329
I don't even know what this is.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.669
One night, years ago,
I got very drunk.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.421
I drive home to my building,

20:14.505 --> 20:16.298
pull into the garage, park at my spot.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.466
I get in the elevator.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.093
It's late. There's no operator.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.220
Go up to the 1 2th floor. Get out.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.014
I'm walking down the hall.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.099
It's pink and orange.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.227
I remember how ugly it was.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.938
Suddenly, my key
won't fit in the door.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.900
Wasn't my building .

20:38.195 --> 20:41.114
I guess what I'm saying is, uh . . .

20:41.198 --> 20:44.200
at some point, we've all
parked in the wrong garage.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.414
Thanks for the bottle, Roger.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.041
And?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.588
Betty's going to want that glass back.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.214
Good man .

21:03.846 --> 21:05.931
Maybe I should get a case of those, huh?

21:22.114 --> 21:24.157
This is taking a long time.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.700
Is it that complicated?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.495
Ah, the blue box,
You must be a newlywed .

21:28.579 --> 21:30.121
That explains it.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.248
Yes, it does. Adorable.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.794
My husband , he'd rather
be drinking at lunch,

21:35.878 --> 21:37.504
even when we were newlyweds, I think.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.005
He's in advertising .

21:39.090 --> 21:40.882
I'm in advertising . Sterling Cooper.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.176
He's at BBDO. Media buyer.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.302
Jim Wallace.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.595
Don't know him .

21:45.680 --> 21:48.264
That's because you're here at lunch.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.809
Next.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.978
I'm here to return this.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.187
There's nothing wrong with it.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.855
We got two.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.192
That's why we suggest that people register,
to avoid duplications.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.111
We did register. We got two.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.779
Do you have your receipt?

22:02.863 --> 22:05.198
It was a gift.

22:05.282 --> 22:08.201
Rosemary, we have a bridal return .

22:08.285 --> 22:09.369
Him?

22:09.453 --> 22:11.287
Bridal registry.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.167
It's a Chip 'n' Dip. We got two.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.586
That's practically four of something .

22:19.672 --> 22:20.922
Name?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.007
Campbell .

22:22.091 --> 22:23.591
I suppose you don't have a receipt.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.218
Gosh, I wish I did .

22:25.302 --> 22:27.595
No. It was a gift.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.558
There's nothing here.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.601
Perhaps your wife told you
she was registering

22:33.686 --> 22:35.353
and in the end forgot
to give us her name.

22:35.438 --> 22:36.604
Her name?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.606
Yes. It's under the maiden name.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.275
H mm . It's Vogel .

22:40.359 --> 22:42.235
Why would you do that?

22:42.319 --> 22:43.445
I don't know.

22:44.739 --> 22:45.989
H umps.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.575
Humps the Camel Campbell.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.244
Matherton . What are you doing here?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.329
Getting my racquet restrung .

22:53.414 --> 22:55.123
Men's room back this way?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.250
Down the hall past the water fountain .

22:57.334 --> 22:59.502
What are you doing here?

22:59.587 --> 23:01.254
Returning a wedding gift.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.131
Not mine, I hope.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.259
No, it's a Chip 'n' Dip. Trudy's aunt.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.679
That's Trudy Vogel . Do you mind , lovely?

23:09.764 --> 23:10.889
Uh , what is it?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.891
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.

23:12.975 --> 23:16.436
You put chips on the side
and dip in the middle.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.271
For entertaining .

23:18.355 --> 23:19.814
It's a beaut.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.399
Hell of a wedding , by the way.

23:21.484 --> 23:24.444
Your cousin Bethany--
bridesmaid's bridesmaid .

23:25.696 --> 23:28.281
Connecticut College for Women , indeed .

23:28.365 --> 23:30.366
I think I found it.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.953
That's nice.

23:34.038 --> 23:37.248
Good to see you ,
We should do this sometime.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.958
I'm coming back for you .

23:42.379 --> 23:44.464
Do you have a receipt?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.883
No. I might have already said that.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.302
It was a gift.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.678
I can give you store credit.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.055
I was expecting cash .

23:52.139 --> 23:54.307
I'm sorry.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.310
Isn't there a way we could work this out?

23:57.394 --> 23:59.312
Let me by you a drink.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.397
I have an expense account.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.735
The best I can do is put
the store credit in your name

24:05.820 --> 24:07.195
so you can spend it here.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.240
I would think about spending it on you
if you gave me cash .

24:10.324 --> 24:11.324
It's $22.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.409
Store credit.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.162
Thank you .

24:19.500 --> 24:21.417
By the way, Matherton--

24:22.419 --> 24:24.420
he has the clap.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.265
Same price as a Chip 'n' Dip.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.434
Amazing .

24:40.187 --> 24:42.147
And I was going to try
to make you feel bad

24:42.231 --> 24:44.107
by telling you where
Carlotta's stockings end .

24:44.191 --> 24:45.817
What the hell is that for?

24:45.901 --> 24:47.360
It's for me.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.362
.22 caliber bolt action .

24:49.446 --> 24:51.364
Use it in good health .

24:51.448 --> 24:53.366
Why not?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.451
Boys will be boys, right?

24:59.623 --> 25:02.375
You couldn't hit the side
of St. Patrick's with that.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.044
It's good for 20 yards.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.937
It's your 4:30, Mr. Campbell .

25:32.156 --> 25:35.074
The N ixon brain trust
is coming in tomorrow.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.577
The nomination is expected as a lock.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.370
All we need is an opponent.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.415
Rumor is Lyndon Johnson's
going to be making a play at the Convention ,

25:42.499 --> 25:44.834
so we may not be going
against Kennedy at all.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.419
Then we have to worry
about the South .

25:46.503 --> 25:48.379
It's going to be Kennedy.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.466
Boston Blackie won West Virginia.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.635
Now, where does that leave us?

25:53.719 --> 25:56.846
"Nixon : experience in office,
knows foreign affairs."

25:56.931 --> 25:58.097
He probably learned that

25:58.182 --> 26:01.100
when they were throwing
rocks at him in Caracas.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.937
"Knows the real threat of communism ,
home and abroad ."

26:04.021 --> 26:07.106
He's not helping himself
keeping quiet on Castro.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.441
True, but he's not a Catholic.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.901
Our hands are tied there.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.862
N ixon thinks hitting
the Catholic thing is a bad idea.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.447
They're going to say that.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.782
To us? They believe it.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.992
It hasn't held up
in any of the primaries.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.411
Kennedy keeps making
opponents apologize.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.788
For what?

26:21.872 --> 26:23.456
For being intolerant.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.707
This is Dick Nixon we're talking about.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.042
You may be too young to remember

26:26.126 --> 26:30.255
the "pink lady" congress. . .woman
from California.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.548
He practically shot her in the face to win .

26:34.218 --> 26:35.385
If it is Kennedy,

26:35.469 --> 26:37.679
N ixon will lower himself
to the occasion .

26:37.763 --> 26:39.472
It's going to be Kennedy.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.225
Good . Catholic son of a millionaire.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.478
A boy too scared to do anything
but go on vacation .

26:45.562 --> 26:48.481
I met him . Heis a boy.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.774
He's only four years
younger than N ixon .

26:49.858 --> 26:52.402
But has he been sitting
next to the leader of the free world

26:52.486 --> 26:53.486
for twice that time?

26:53.570 --> 26:54.862
He's inexperienced .

26:54.947 --> 26:56.489
He doesn't even wear a hat.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.491
I don't know.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.702
You know who else
doesn't wear a hat?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.078
Elvis.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.706
That's what we're dealing with .

27:07.584 --> 27:10.503
Remind me to stop
hiring young people.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.171
America does not want
some greasy kid

27:12.256 --> 27:15.300
with his finger on the button .

27:15.384 --> 27:17.677
Now if the adults can weigh in?

27:25.477 --> 27:28.521
"Communism , taxes, health care."

27:28.605 --> 27:32.025
Kinsey, you want to write this down,
or should I call a girl in?

27:42.119 --> 27:44.537
Hi, honey. I made a roast beef.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.539
Just cut the strings.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.832
Oh, roast beef?

27:49.626 --> 27:51.586
You know it's just me tonight, right?

28:07.061 --> 28:10.188
That was a wedding gift
from my Aunt Letty!

28:10.272 --> 28:12.106
And you go and get some stupid toy?

28:12.191 --> 28:13.483
I can't believe you !

28:13.567 --> 28:15.485
That was for us!

28:15.569 --> 28:17.278
You're always telling me to grow up.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.280
I can't believe you !

28:23.494 --> 28:24.494
Oh, I can leave it there?

28:24.578 --> 28:25.578
Thanks.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.871
Great. Thank you .

28:50.896 --> 28:52.688
Hollis, let me ask you something .

29:05.744 --> 29:07.620
U h , Mr. Campbell,

29:07.704 --> 29:10.998
I thought I'd take you up on your offer
to look at my work.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.708
But if you're in the middle of something--

29:18.465 --> 29:19.590
What's that?

29:19.675 --> 29:22.051
A wedding present.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.721
I really appreciate it.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.435
You ever been hunting, Peggy?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.645
No, I don't think so.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.647
You either have or you haven't.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.650
I went a couple of times with my uncle.

29:37.734 --> 29:38.776
New Hampshire.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.489
I saw my cousin shoot a rabbit
by Coney Island .

29:43.574 --> 29:46.409
It's an incredible sensation.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.371
You have to be very quiet.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.794
Take it down with the first shot,

29:56.879 --> 29:58.546
or you scare it away.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.757
And sometimes you have to go up
and finish it off.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.013
Then you tie it to the bumper,
and you go home.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.393
But you know what I've
always wanted to do?

30:14.021 --> 30:16.689
I would pick it up. . .

30:16.773 --> 30:18.983
throw its back legs over my shoulder,

30:19.067 --> 30:23.488
and I would drag it through the snow
to this little cabin .

30:23.572 --> 30:25.615
And there. . .

30:25.699 --> 30:27.325
I'd hang it up. . .

30:27.409 --> 30:30.369
between a couple of trees,

30:30.454 --> 30:32.163
cut it open,

30:32.247 --> 30:33.581
drain it,

30:33.665 --> 30:36.292
dress it,

30:36.376 --> 30:38.252
and then I'd take
my big hunting knife,

30:38.337 --> 30:42.798
and I'd cut this loin
right out of the side.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.722
And I'd go into the cabin ,

30:49.806 --> 30:53.976
and there'd be this woman
waiting for me,

30:54.061 --> 30:56.729
standing by one of those old stoves

30:56.813 --> 30:58.439
with a big black pipe,

30:58.524 --> 31:00.066
and I'd hand it to her,

31:00.150 --> 31:03.361
and she'd put it in a cast-iron skillet,

31:03.445 --> 31:06.906
and then I'd sit at the table. . .

31:06.990 --> 31:09.825
and she'd bring it to me.

31:11.745 --> 31:14.372
And I'd wipe my knife on my knee. . .

31:16.124 --> 31:20.836
and then I would eat it
while she watches.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.508
That would be wonderful .

31:28.845 --> 31:31.847
I'll take a look at this for you .

31:36.937 --> 31:38.271
Thank you .

32:03.380 --> 32:04.880
Can I get a ham sandwich?

32:06.967 --> 32:08.926
You know what?
I'll take a cherry Danish .

32:09.011 --> 32:11.387
The big one in the back.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.020
Thank you , ma'am . There you go.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.589
Helen . Hello.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.841
Hi, Betty.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.259
How are you?

32:51.386 --> 32:52.428
I'm well.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.722
And how's Glen?

32:57.768 --> 32:59.518
I wasn't going to say anything .

32:59.603 --> 33:01.812
I was just going to go right on by.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.649
What's wrong?

33:04.733 --> 33:08.361
I was going . . .

33:10.989 --> 33:13.866
I was going through Glen's
treasure box the other day,

33:13.950 --> 33:16.619
and I found a lock of blonde hair.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.079
Your hair, he says.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.873
Well , I don't know what he told you .

33:20.957 --> 33:22.124
Glen doesn't lie, not when he's caught.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.959
- I'm not saying it's a lie.
- Betty.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.462
He asked me for it.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.880
And you gave it to him?

33:27.964 --> 33:29.882
He is 9 years old .

33:31.551 --> 33:33.094
What is wrong with you?

33:46.900 --> 33:49.902
He was a bold man
that first ate an oyster.

33:49.986 --> 33:53.197
I believe that was Jonathan Swift.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.990
Are we naming them now?

33:56.535 --> 33:57.910
Look at you .

33:57.994 --> 33:59.912
I had no idea you were
such a fan of the mollusk.

33:59.996 --> 34:05.668
Never gave them a chance before,
but I'm acquiring a taste.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.586
It's like eating a mermaid .

34:09.798 --> 34:13.551
Ready for another,
or have you topped off your tank?

34:13.635 --> 34:15.344
You're leading this dance.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.472
Well, what the hell? It's the G .O. P.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.016
They'll never smell it
over the stench of Brylcreem .

34:22.519 --> 34:23.728
Another round .

34:23.812 --> 34:25.730
Wait. Are you still good with these,

34:25.814 --> 34:27.523
or do you prefer your beloved rye?

34:27.607 --> 34:30.151
Today I'm on the Roger Sterling diet.

34:30.235 --> 34:34.697
Easy on the vermouth,
another dozen of these.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.699
Me, as well .

34:39.077 --> 34:42.413
I've always thought you were
a man who could keep up, Don .

35:00.056 --> 35:02.475
Anything else, gentlemen?

35:02.559 --> 35:04.435
Did you know
they served cheesecake

35:04.519 --> 35:06.604
to the Olympic athletes
in ancient Greece?

35:06.688 --> 35:09.982
So what's an extra lap or two
around the steno pool for us?

35:10.066 --> 35:11.400
Two cheesecakes.

35:11.485 --> 35:14.445
And don't let me see
the bottom of this glass.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.574
What were we talking about?

35:18.658 --> 35:19.992
Oh , yes, the Russians.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.411
Shooting those dogs into space.

35:22.537 --> 35:27.416
I believe we branded them cat lovers
and moved on to the subject of true love.

35:27.501 --> 35:30.503
Right. Desi and Lucy-- please.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.254
He's divorcing her again .

35:32.339 --> 35:35.925
Did he wake up one morning and say
"Oh, yeah , I forgot, I hate you"?

35:38.220 --> 35:41.055
What makes a man marry
the same woman twice?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.015
I believe in his case,

35:43.099 --> 35:45.100
it was the lure of orange hair.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.146
I like redheads.

35:49.231 --> 35:54.109
Their mouths are like a drop
of strawberry jam in a glass of milk.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.241
I think I woke my ulcer up.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.243
Drinking milk.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.662
I never liked it.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.163
I hate cows.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.880
You keep matching me like this,

36:14.965 --> 36:17.466
you'll have an ulcer
of your own, any day now.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.219
One more?

36:20.303 --> 36:22.805
Instead of coffee?

36:22.889 --> 36:24.056
Sure.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.058
But then we should get the check.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.163
Hey, Birdie. I have the shirt.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.084
What is this?

36:52.168 --> 36:54.920
Bobby spilled some Concord grape juice
down the front of it.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.088
I washed it.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.717
Uh , this is Ernie's shirt, not Bobby's.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.802
Well, what do you know?

37:01.887 --> 37:05.514
Oh , did you have a party
you didn't invite me to?

37:05.599 --> 37:09.643
I'll invite you . It's going to be a dinner party.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.604
I'm just trying the wine, you know.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.106
Develop my palate.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.816
Do you want some? It's a split.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.651
There's another glass.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.278
How are you?

37:19.362 --> 37:21.030
I'm good .

37:23.408 --> 37:25.784
Maybe I will try some.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.959
Betty,

37:34.044 --> 37:36.670
Jill Sandifer was
in the market earlier today.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.380
What?

37:38.465 --> 37:40.382
Is it true?

37:40.467 --> 37:42.092
You're my friend , Francine.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.469
Are you coming over here to do recon?

37:43.553 --> 37:45.220
I'm worried about you .

37:56.149 --> 37:58.233
I don't know what happened .

37:59.778 --> 38:02.571
I kept thinking in the car
on the way back,

38:02.656 --> 38:05.074
"Did that really happen?"

38:05.158 --> 38:06.951
And . . .

38:07.035 --> 38:08.577
then I just put it out of my mind .

38:08.662 --> 38:10.537
Well, what did happen?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.247
Whatever you heard .

38:14.960 --> 38:17.461
I mean, I don't even want to hear it.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.588
I have my own version,
and it's plenty.

38:19.673 --> 38:20.798
It's okay.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.007
Honestly, I don't know anyone

38:22.092 --> 38:24.176
who wouldn't want
to take a good poke at her.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.636
She's so selfish .

38:25.720 --> 38:27.179
Those long walks

38:27.263 --> 38:31.183
and that pathetic job
at Benson's Jewelry.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.686
Carlton went in there
to buy me some earrings.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.522
I'm sure she loved that.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.440
When I saw the Benson's Jewelry
wrapping paper,

38:38.525 --> 38:40.484
I almost threw it in his face.

38:40.568 --> 38:44.196
And that John Kennedy. I hate him .

38:44.280 --> 38:45.864
Really?

38:47.283 --> 38:49.410
What will people think?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.829
I think they'll be glad
to know you're not a marshmallow.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.498
Do people think I'm weak?

38:54.582 --> 38:57.668
No. It's just you're so sweet and perfect.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.169
I'm not.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.046
Well , it does seem that way.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.215
Look, it'll all be forgotten .

39:03.299 --> 39:06.385
We don't have to include
Helen Bishop anymore.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.138
Let her know
whose side we're all on .

39:10.515 --> 39:14.226
Uh, my mother. . .

39:14.310 --> 39:15.894
always said ,

39:15.979 --> 39:18.397
"You're painting a masterpiece.

39:18.481 --> 39:22.651
Make sure to hide the brushstrokes."

39:22.736 --> 39:24.695
She was really beautiful.

39:24.779 --> 39:29.074
Then I think, um . . .

39:29.159 --> 39:31.702
"Why am I doing all this? I'm not that vain ."

39:31.786 --> 39:33.912
What does Dr. Wayne say?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.539
Nothing. . .

39:35.623 --> 39:39.126
except "Tell me more about that."

39:39.210 --> 39:41.879
I'm still dying to try it.

39:41.963 --> 39:48.469
I'm pretty sure Dr, Wayne tried
to look down my neckline the other day.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.220
He sits behind me.

39:50.305 --> 39:54.016
And as far as I'm concerned ,
as long as men look at me that way,

39:54.100 --> 39:58.020
I'm earning my keep.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.314
Then every once in a while,

40:00.398 --> 40:03.275
I think. . .

40:03.359 --> 40:05.277
No.

40:05.361 --> 40:08.864
This is something else.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.366
I don't want my husband to see this.

40:13.203 --> 40:16.246
I love to be looked at that way.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.335
You should get out of here.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.378
Nap time is about to end .

40:25.590 --> 40:27.382
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

40:34.182 --> 40:36.225
We haven't gone over the N ixon plan .

40:36.309 --> 40:37.684
You prepared , right?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.478
In what way?

40:39.562 --> 40:40.854
I'm sorry, gentlemen .

40:40.939 --> 40:42.856
Mr. Sterling, Mr, Draper,
I'm waiting for service.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.775
So am I . What are you talking about?

40:44.859 --> 40:46.110
We're out of order.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.487
Oh, crap.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.697
When will they be back up?
Should we wait?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.783
We've got our best man on it.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.494
That's a comfort.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.538
Jesus, we're already late.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.289
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Sterling .

40:59.374 --> 41:01.834
It's certainly a believable excuse.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.335
We could go back to lunch.

41:03.419 --> 41:07.506
No. Cooper would have a seizure,
if he hasn't already.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.591
So?

41:35.285 --> 41:37.035
Ah , this is ridiculous. A building this big .

41:37.120 --> 41:38.370
What if there was a fire?

41:38.454 --> 41:40.914
We'd be walking down .

41:40.999 --> 41:42.207
It would be easier.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.221
Maybe we should check the elevator.

41:56.306 --> 41:57.389
Maybe it's up again .

41:57.473 --> 42:00.392
I think we'd hear it go on in the stairwell .

42:00.476 --> 42:01.727
You think?

42:01.811 --> 42:03.645
Roger, I don't know.

42:03.730 --> 42:06.148
Maybe they're late, too.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.983
Maybe we could get them to come down

42:08.067 --> 42:10.068
and have the presentation
on the eighth floor landing .

42:10.153 --> 42:11.153
There's plenty of seats.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.404
Damned elevator.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.531
What do you want to do?
We're almost there.

42:14.616 --> 42:15.991
The hell we are.

42:16.117 --> 42:19.453
Well, we can waste another five minutes
talking about it, if you want.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.121
Let's go.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.541
Get behind me with that thing .

42:41.643 --> 42:43.018
Six to go.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.895
I've been counting .

42:47.148 --> 42:48.440
You want to rest a minute?

42:48.524 --> 42:51.944
No, sir. No, I don't.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.820
Keep moving .

42:53.905 --> 42:56.531
I forgot. Navy man .

43:08.628 --> 43:10.545
I love redheads.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.048
With big breasts.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.884
We'll find you one if we still have jobs.

43:15.969 --> 43:18.428
Want me to run ahead?

43:18.513 --> 43:20.472
Run?

43:20.556 --> 43:22.849
My name's on the building .

43:22.934 --> 43:24.559
They can wait for me.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.106
I got to stop talking .

43:45.790 --> 43:47.457
I'm fine.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.501
Just lost my tie clip.

43:49.585 --> 43:50.711
I'll find it. Go on .

43:50.795 --> 43:51.837
You sure?

43:51.921 --> 43:54.423
I said go on .

44:05.810 --> 44:07.602
Found it!

44:25.163 --> 44:27.539
- Where the hell were you?
- Elevator's out.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.374
- That's quite a hike. Where's Sterling?
- He's coming .

44:30.710 --> 44:33.003
Well, here are the troops now.

44:33.087 --> 44:35.464
Lou , M ichael, Charlie, uh, Don Draper.

44:35.548 --> 44:36.548
Hey, Don.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.383
Our creative muscle.

44:38.468 --> 44:40.385
Hopefully, a little brains, too.

44:40.470 --> 44:41.678
Sorry to keep you fellas waiting .

44:41.763 --> 44:43.430
The elevator's out.

44:43.514 --> 44:44.806
Pete Campbell , of course.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.058
We've spoken on the phone.

44:46.142 --> 44:47.559
Yeah , yeah .

44:47.643 --> 44:51.021
He'll continue handling things for you .

44:51.105 --> 44:53.815
And when I say handling ,
I mean he runs everything by me.

44:56.986 --> 45:01.782
And, of course, uh ,
my partner, Roger Sterling .

45:03.659 --> 45:05.577
We heard the elevator's down.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.205
Those boys over at United Fruit

45:08.289 --> 45:11.041
talk about you like you
invented the damn banana.

45:12.668 --> 45:13.794
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:17.715 --> 45:18.965
You all right, Roger?

45:19.050 --> 45:21.301
Get us some ice water.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.677
Oysters.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.805
I can see that.

45:24.889 --> 45:27.724
23 floors.

45:27.809 --> 45:29.601
I'm just sorry I missed this lunch .

45:29.685 --> 45:31.645
We were with some Quakers.
Had cottage cheese.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.815
Well, let's let Roger regroup.

45:34.899 --> 45:35.899
- Okay,
- Yeah .

45:35.983 --> 45:37.609
This way.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.569
I'll be right in .

45:49.288 --> 45:50.539
You okay?

45:55.420 --> 45:57.003
Yeah .

45:57.088 --> 45:58.713
Fine.

46:01.217 --> 46:02.843
Good .
