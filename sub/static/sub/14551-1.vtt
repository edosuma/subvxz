00:31.855 --> 00:34.854
So this chick thought being a Powers
cop meant that I had powers myself.

00:34.855 --> 00:37.315
Yeah. I'm sure
you set her straight.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.855
I might have suggested
that I was bulletproof.

00:39.856 --> 00:41.854
Hey, hey. Check it out.

00:41.855 --> 00:43.854
Settle down, big guy.

00:43.855 --> 00:46.855
Iron Impact,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:46.855 --> 00:48.939
He'll be appearing here all day before
his tour takes him to the Shaft

00:49.065 --> 00:50.855
for an extended residency.

00:51.155 --> 00:52.155
Yeah!

00:53.155 --> 00:56.154
No, stop. You're too kind.

00:56.156 --> 01:00.156
Walker, Zerotron here
is giving me shit on that club fire.

01:00.156 --> 01:01.456
Oh, yeah, give me a sec.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.348
Hey, Stockley, your kid called.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.667
Is everything okay?

01:04.791 --> 01:07.248
Something about a track meet,
I don't know.

01:07.249 --> 01:10.247
Hey, listen, call Krispin.
I'll lock up this asshole.

01:10.248 --> 01:12.247
Don't worry about it. I got him.
You sure?

01:12.248 --> 01:14.328
- Deal with that asshole over there.
- Okay, big guy.

01:15.248 --> 01:17.875
Hey, Zerotron-X,

01:18.848 --> 01:20.348
you've been lighting up again.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.248
No, man.
No?

01:22.332 --> 01:24.247
Krisp! What's up, kid?

01:24.248 --> 01:25.499
Dose him again, Bri.

01:31.248 --> 01:34.248
So, tell me
what happened at the club?

01:43.208 --> 01:45.207
- Stop him! Against the wall!
- Stop him now!

01:49.208 --> 01:50.208
Aah!

02:13.208 --> 02:14.208
Hey, I'm Mario Lopez.

02:14.209 --> 02:16.208
<i>Extra's </i> obtained
exclusive footage

02:16.208 --> 02:18.207
<i>of the attack on
a veteran detective</i>

02:18.208 --> 02:20.207
<i>inside the police station.</i>

02:20.208 --> 02:22.207
<i>Well, in a tragic oversight,</i>

02:22.208 --> 02:25.207
<i>Iron Impact didn't get
the right dose of sedatives</i>

02:25.208 --> 02:28.207
<i>which is mandated in
all Powers arrests.</i>

02:28.208 --> 02:31.207
<i>Now, viewers will recognize
Detective Christian Walker,</i>

02:31.208 --> 02:33.207
<i>saving the day,
but not at all like he did</i>

02:33.208 --> 02:35.207
<i>when he wore
the mantle of Diamond.</i>

02:35.208 --> 02:37.751
A former icon of the
Powers community,

02:37.876 --> 02:40.207
Diamond once ranked
among the best.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.043
<i>He was not only a teammate of
Olympia and Triphammer,</i>

02:43.168 --> 02:45.207
<i>but also Retro Girl herself.</i>

02:45.208 --> 02:46.207
<i>These Heroes United</i>

02:46.208 --> 02:47.209
<i>once partied as hard</i>

02:47.376 --> 02:49.207
<i>as they fought to
protect the city.</i>

02:49.208 --> 02:51.085
<i>And now, the big question,</i>

02:51.208 --> 02:52.793
<i>can we trust this fallen hero?</i>

02:52.960 --> 02:54.207
Diamond was once
close friends with

02:54.208 --> 02:56.207
the notorious Johnny Royalle

02:56.208 --> 02:58.207
<i>as well as the murderous Wolfe.</i>

02:58.208 --> 03:01.207
<i>And while Royalle is assumed dead,
and Wolfe behind bars,</i>

03:01.208 --> 03:05.207
<i>there's a shadow over
Diamond's reputation to this day.</i>

03:05.208 --> 03:07.207
<i>That was before
he lost his powers</i>

03:07.208 --> 03:09.448
<i>and became Detective Christian Walker
of Powers Division.</i>

03:09.459 --> 03:11.207
<i>But now everyone is wondering,</i>

03:11.208 --> 03:13.626
<i>were these deaths
due to police negligence,</i>

03:13.751 --> 03:15.501
<i>accident or murder?</i>

03:15.626 --> 03:20.207
<i>And whose side is Diamond, excuse me,
Detective Walker truly on?</i>

03:20.208 --> 03:22.208
<i>Stay tuned.
Back to you, Mike.</i>

03:56.918 --> 03:59.208
How does it feel, Christian?

04:00.208 --> 04:02.208
In your heart, I mean.

04:07.710 --> 04:11.207
<i>How does it feel
when they die and die</i>

04:11.208 --> 04:12.208
<i>and keep on dying?</i>

04:56.208 --> 04:59.208
How does it feel
to be powerless?

05:18.208 --> 05:21.207
<i>♪ How does it feel ♪</i>

05:21.208 --> 05:24.751

06:08.793 --> 06:09.793
Oh.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.068
What color mask was he wearing?

06:17.069 --> 06:22.207
Powers Division is not
what you'd call over-resourced.

06:22.208 --> 06:25.208
Metro PD would rather
not be reminded we exist,

06:25.208 --> 06:28.207
so the city gave
us this building.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.584
It was a post office
in the '30s.

06:30.751 --> 06:34.207
Half of our equipment's
been seized from busts.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.207
In the five years since
I founded the division,

06:36.208 --> 06:39.207
we've never had
a budget increase.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.207
You've had enough
of the Sheriff's Department?

06:41.208 --> 06:42.208
Oh, yeah.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.207
Outer Banks Patrol Division.
What was that like?

06:45.208 --> 06:48.207
Talking bangers and straight up
criminal types?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.207
We got the job done.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.207
But some Power gets out of hand,

06:52.208 --> 06:54.207
policy was leave
'em the fuck alone.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.207
Let a hero take care of it.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.207
Any alliances?

06:58.208 --> 07:00.207
Sheriff is tight
with Blackguard.

07:00.208 --> 07:02.584
But can't always
get him on the phone.

07:02.751 --> 07:05.207
We don't leave them
the fuck alone here.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.208
And we don't wait
for tactical support from a hero.

07:09.501 --> 07:11.208
Often as not,

07:12.208 --> 07:13.208
we pay a price.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.207
Jesus.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.207
Someone should that clean up.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.208
I wanted you to see it first.

07:23.668 --> 07:25.207
Good luck, Detective.

07:25.208 --> 07:26.208
Thank you, sir.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.543
Introduce yourself.

07:30.418 --> 07:33.208
See if you can
teach him something.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.208
Detective Kutter.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.207
Nice guns.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.668
Nice chin pubes, Kutter.

08:03.208 --> 08:06.001
I'm your new partner,
Deena Pilgrim.

08:12.209 --> 08:14.208
Big shoes.

08:32.085 --> 08:33.207
Hmm.

08:36.207 --> 08:37.207
Ahem.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.208
How old is this car?

08:53.208 --> 08:54.793
Where are we headed?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.960
Oh, my condolences. I...

09:09.584 --> 09:11.207
Yeah. What...

09:11.208 --> 09:13.127
Krispin?
Hey, Walker.

09:13.459 --> 09:16.208
Hey, man, you okay?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.876
No school?

09:19.001 --> 09:20.207
Back tomorrow.

09:20.208 --> 09:23.207
Mom doesn't want me
getting depressed.

09:23.208 --> 09:24.208
Yeah.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.207
How's the job?

09:26.208 --> 09:27.626
Still the job.

09:29.043 --> 09:30.207
Kill any more Powers?

09:30.208 --> 09:31.208
That's not the job.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.207
Should be.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.207
I was a Power, Krispin.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.207
No, I...

09:37.208 --> 09:38.668
Who is it, Krisp?

09:39.208 --> 09:40.208
It's Walker.

09:41.208 --> 09:42.208
Brian's desk.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.208
Just thought you should have it.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.710
Can I?

09:48.710 --> 09:50.208
Yeah.

09:50.334 --> 09:53.207
You were a hero, Walker.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.208
That's different from just being
a Power, you know?

10:02.793 --> 10:05.207
Are you sure there's
nothing in there that'll hurt him?

10:05.208 --> 10:09.207
I had to turn in Brian's
back up piece and all that stuff.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.207
I mean, like,
a phone with names,

10:12.208 --> 10:14.207
numbers,
pictures of Brian's girls.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.207
I took care of it.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.207
Thanks.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.208
You okay?

10:19.208 --> 10:20.292
I tried to call.

10:20.459 --> 10:22.208
I didn't want to talk.

10:22.876 --> 10:24.207
But you didn't...

10:24.208 --> 10:26.208
That's why I didn't
answer the phone.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.168
Yeah, sure, okay.

10:31.208 --> 10:32.208
Yeah, okay.

10:46.208 --> 10:47.208
I could eat something.

10:49.418 --> 10:50.710
New guy drives.

10:55.584 --> 10:57.207
<i>I said no onions.</i>

10:57.208 --> 10:59.208
- You hear me say no onions?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:04.168 --> 11:05.727
All right,
I'm gonna say something.

11:06.918 --> 11:08.376
You look different
without the mask.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.207
That was the idea.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.207
Most of those masks.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.085
Come on, you figured you'd make
those guys right away.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.208
You...

11:19.208 --> 11:21.208
Ah, you look really different.

11:23.835 --> 11:25.208
I never got made.

11:25.710 --> 11:27.001
Hmm?

11:27.127 --> 11:28.638
My neighbors didn't look twice.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.207
It's context.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.296
Nobody expects to see a Power
like Diamond mowing his lawn.

11:35.296 --> 11:37.207
You mowed your own lawn?

11:37.208 --> 11:40.207
No, I live in a condo.
The lawn was a for instance.

11:40.208 --> 11:43.501
Sure. So, for instance,
where's your condo?

11:44.376 --> 11:46.208
Tailor Heights. You?

11:46.251 --> 11:49.207
I'm, uh, between places.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.208
Had a personal thing go to shit.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.208
So, I'm staying in
Cannon Flats with my dad.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.208
Oh, holy.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.207
Oh!

12:05.208 --> 12:07.208
Oh, man.
What is that like?

12:08.208 --> 12:10.208
Come on.
Let's go see a dead body.

12:12.208 --> 12:13.208
Jesus, shit, Philip.

12:16.208 --> 12:20.208
That's a really big,
really naked dead body.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.208
It's Olympia.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.207
Yeah.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.583
You've ever seen
a Power fucking?

12:29.208 --> 12:31.208
Goddamn Olympia.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.207
My dad loves this guy.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.459
Cops on his task force in the day,
they all had Olympia tattoos.

12:39.208 --> 12:42.208
You're Waldo Pilgrim's
daughter. Right?

12:45.208 --> 12:46.918
Is she the girl?

12:48.208 --> 12:49.208
No.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.208
Jesus.

12:57.251 --> 13:00.710
We're thinking hero over there is good for
at least statutory rape.

13:00.835 --> 13:02.207
You left her in here?

13:02.208 --> 13:04.208
I was waiting on a matron.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.208
You okay?

13:14.208 --> 13:16.208
I don't feel different at all.

13:24.793 --> 13:27.208
Hey, let's get out of here.
Okay.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.127
What the fuck is her problem?

13:38.208 --> 13:40.208
You're an asshole
is her problem.

13:41.208 --> 13:45.208
Another day with you and she'll know
what an asshole really is.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.208
I'm not going to wait forever.

13:57.101 --> 13:58.101
He's never late.

14:00.656 --> 14:02.408
I'm not meant to be here.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.656
I told you we needed to expand.

14:07.656 --> 14:09.656
He hooked Olympia
up with a girl.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.055
Got her to pass him some Sway.

14:13.068 --> 14:15.067
Yeah, I did.

14:15.068 --> 14:17.067
I'm fronting this
and I'm getting what?

14:17.068 --> 14:20.068
Sway could be huge.
But people have to know about it.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.967
Who's the girl?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.001
A Wannabe.

14:24.126 --> 14:26.999
He's got her shacked at
the old Prattland rail barn.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Is that where she is now?

14:29.293 --> 14:30.585
Call for you.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.999
Who is it?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.043
It's me.

14:33.168 --> 14:34.752
What do you want?

14:34.877 --> 14:35.877
I didn't say.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.335
Yes?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.000
<i>Olympia is dead.</i>

14:40.335 --> 14:41.627
And?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.084
The police have the girl.

14:45.376 --> 14:47.000
Powers Division.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
Bug, you've made things
much harder for me.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Hitting the Sway, huh?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.999
Giving your powers a boost?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.585
That's the idea, isn't it?

15:08.752 --> 15:10.000
Everyone gets a boost.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.084
Not everyone.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.210
Just the ones who need it most.

15:14.335 --> 15:19.668
The outcasts, the foundlings,
the broken toys.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.999
We're throwing money away

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
giving Sway to these
fucking Powerz Kidz.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I was one of those
"fucking Powerz Kidz."

15:31.418 --> 15:33.000
Never fear, Bug.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
We are all of us merely here

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
then gone.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.585
Wannabe.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.999
You know,
back when I was what I was,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
this girl, one time
after she blew me, she flew.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.999
Hovered, really.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.999
It happens sometimes
with an exchange of fluids.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
And it's something you can try if
you're a Powers wannabe.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.710
You're talking about
girls sucking off heroes

16:45.877 --> 16:47.335
to get a dose of powers?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.000
Not just girls.
Boys do it, too.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.376
Shitbag Olympia motherfucker.

17:05.893 --> 17:06.893
All right.

17:09.893 --> 17:13.893
I have soda, juice, water,

17:14.060 --> 17:16.893
<i>candy, chips, Snickers.</i>

17:17.893 --> 17:19.645
<i>Help yourself.</i>

17:19.770 --> 17:21.935
It's okay. I can talk enough
for the both of us.

17:26.893 --> 17:29.893
You know, finding a guy
like Olympia dead.

17:30.893 --> 17:33.892
That must have
been really scary.

17:33.893 --> 17:34.893
Mmm.

17:36.686 --> 17:39.893
I don't know,
maybe it was a relief,

17:41.436 --> 17:42.893
depending on what was going on?

17:44.893 --> 17:47.311
You don't have to be scared now.

17:47.478 --> 17:49.892
Whoever killed Olympia
can't touch you here.

17:49.893 --> 17:52.061
Olympia can't touch you either.

17:52.228 --> 17:53.892
What do you even do here?

17:53.893 --> 17:55.892
Powers Division is a circus.

17:55.893 --> 17:57.893
Everyone knows that.
I don't think you're really in a...

17:57.893 --> 18:00.892
Cops never ever catch the really big,
really bad Powers.

18:00.893 --> 18:03.892
You didn't catch
Pulp or Black Mondo.

18:03.893 --> 18:06.892
Without help from other
Powers, you're fucked.

18:06.893 --> 18:08.893
Wow. You're kind of a...

18:09.893 --> 18:10.893
I caught Wolfe.

18:12.436 --> 18:13.893
You didn't catch Wolfe.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.892
That old Power did.

18:16.893 --> 18:18.744
It was a big deal
when I was a kid.

18:18.893 --> 18:20.893
The guy with the funny mask.

18:21.478 --> 18:22.893
"The guy with the funny mask."

18:28.893 --> 18:32.893
Yeah, but you lost
your powers fighting Wolfe later,

18:33.893 --> 18:34.893
when he escaped.

18:35.812 --> 18:37.892
Then you became a cop.

18:37.893 --> 18:40.561
There's a whole
<i>Powers That Be</i> episode about you.

18:42.561 --> 18:43.893
Diamond.

18:45.436 --> 18:46.893
Cross needs you.
Uh...

18:58.893 --> 19:01.893
It's cool that you're Diamond and shit,
but it's not like you're Supershock.

19:01.893 --> 19:03.893
Or Retro Girl.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.893
She's only, like, a goddess.

19:11.893 --> 19:12.893
You were a thing.

19:13.893 --> 19:16.892
I know everything about her.

19:16.893 --> 19:18.686
You were a thing.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.892
Oh, my God.
You hooked up with Retro Girl.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.892
You want to see something?

19:22.893 --> 19:25.893
This is where she hangs out.

19:28.478 --> 19:31.353
She's a bird of prey
and that's her perch.

19:32.893 --> 19:34.893
That is badass.
Yeah.

19:39.893 --> 19:42.892
How did you find out
you had powers?

19:42.893 --> 19:45.892
In high school, back in Seattle,

19:45.893 --> 19:49.561
we used to sneak
out onto the docks,

19:49.686 --> 19:52.892
climb the cargo cranes,
drink beer.

19:52.893 --> 19:54.892
Do dares.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.893
Who can go out the farthest
on the gantry.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.892
I was out there
pretty far one night,

20:01.893 --> 20:05.893
and the wind gusted
and I slipped.

20:07.893 --> 20:09.228
I fell.

20:09.353 --> 20:12.892
I was falling, and all I wanted was
to miss the ground,

20:12.893 --> 20:15.892
but I was gonna hit it
no matter what.

20:15.893 --> 20:19.893
And then, I didn't.

20:22.893 --> 20:25.893
I swooped really fast.

20:29.893 --> 20:31.893
That's how it started for me.

20:34.728 --> 20:35.893
I have powers.

20:36.893 --> 20:41.061
But it's really hard,
waiting to find them.

20:44.893 --> 20:46.977
Sometimes, I forget I lost mine.

20:48.893 --> 20:52.892
I can still feel them,
you know, like a phantom limb.

20:52.893 --> 20:55.893
You should try to do it, jump off
something really tall again.

20:56.019 --> 20:57.892
Yeah, no,
it doesn't work like that.

20:57.893 --> 21:00.892
There was a whole episode on
<i>Powers That Be </i> about heroes

21:00.893 --> 21:01.892
that lost their powers,

21:01.893 --> 21:03.892
and then they would try
to get them back...

21:03.893 --> 21:06.893
Yeah, you don't know what the fuck you're
talking about, okay?

21:09.893 --> 21:10.936
I want my phone.

21:12.770 --> 21:14.228
I want to call someone.

21:14.893 --> 21:15.893
Who?

21:17.893 --> 21:18.893
My mom.

21:22.893 --> 21:23.977
<i>Fine.</i>

21:29.893 --> 21:30.893
Hey, it's me.

21:31.893 --> 21:33.893
<i>I'm at the police station.</i>

21:36.311 --> 21:37.436
Bug isn't here.

21:37.603 --> 21:39.603
He asked me to help you
if you called.

21:40.311 --> 21:41.892
Who is this?

21:41.893 --> 21:42.893
<i>Friend, if you need one.</i>

21:43.893 --> 21:45.893
Look around yourself.

21:46.893 --> 21:48.353
Can you tell me where you are?

21:49.893 --> 21:50.893
What station is this?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.893
Midtown Central.

21:54.893 --> 21:57.892
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

21:57.893 --> 22:00.893
<i>One of those interrogation rooms
like on TV.</i>

22:03.893 --> 22:06.894
I'm diabetic. I can't eat
any of this junk.

22:07.019 --> 22:08.436
Do you have any nuts?

22:13.893 --> 22:15.893
Yeah, nuts it is.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.892
Deena, get her some nuts.

22:20.893 --> 22:23.892
Well you took over the show,
get your own fucking props.

22:23.893 --> 22:25.892
I stepped in there to help you.
The least you could do...

22:25.893 --> 22:28.133
She's eating out of the palm of your hand.
Look at... Oh.

22:29.686 --> 22:30.893
Oh, shit!

22:40.893 --> 22:42.893
It takes some getting used to.

22:45.436 --> 22:46.893
Where's Bug?

22:47.893 --> 22:49.478
He's been helping me.

22:51.893 --> 22:53.353
He's been helping you, how?

22:54.893 --> 22:56.893
He's introducing me to Powers.

22:57.893 --> 22:59.395
Like Olympia.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.892
He said maybe I could meet more
if I wanted.

23:02.893 --> 23:05.892
He gave you Sway for Olympia.

23:05.893 --> 23:07.561
Yeah.

23:09.893 --> 23:10.893
And he took it.

23:11.893 --> 23:13.893
And we hooked up.

23:15.561 --> 23:20.892
I went to the bathroom
to brush my teeth after, you know.

23:20.893 --> 23:24.603
And I came back and he was dead.

23:24.770 --> 23:28.892
Can you tell me who you talked to
at Powers Division?

23:28.893 --> 23:30.520
That cop that
used to be somebody.

23:31.645 --> 23:32.893
Diamond.

23:33.893 --> 23:34.893
Walker.

23:37.893 --> 23:39.893
<i>Yeah, nuts it is.</i>

23:40.893 --> 23:43.269
<i>Deena, get her some nuts.</i>

23:45.893 --> 23:46.893
What was that?

23:49.893 --> 23:51.893
Johnny Royalle.

23:52.603 --> 23:53.893
Royalle is dead.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.186
Yeah, but that distortion
is his power signature.

24:00.770 --> 24:01.892
We need to call the Shaft.

24:01.893 --> 24:02.892
I called the Shaft.

24:02.893 --> 24:05.893
All stations are secure.
Wolfe hasn't moved.

24:06.893 --> 24:08.228
Royalle is dead.

24:08.395 --> 24:10.103
There's no way he
can teleport Wolfe out of the Shaft.

24:10.269 --> 24:11.892
Am I the only one that sees

24:11.893 --> 24:13.892
we need a Dangerous Powers
Bulletin on this girl?

24:13.893 --> 24:15.892
We DPB her and
it will be open season.

24:15.893 --> 24:17.892
She's a Wannabe.

24:17.893 --> 24:19.561
Hey, have you spoken
with Dr. Death?

24:19.728 --> 24:20.892
We need to find the girl.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.853
She'll be down on the strip
with the Powerz Kidz.

24:23.893 --> 24:26.893
Get a cause of death on Olympia
before the media makes one up.

24:30.893 --> 24:34.893
Did you tell him about Bug?
About Sway?

24:47.893 --> 24:49.893
I grew up with Walker.

24:51.893 --> 24:53.561
Diamond.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.853
He picked that name

24:58.893 --> 25:03.893
because he wanted to
be thought of as hard, sharp-edged.

25:05.603 --> 25:06.893
But he wasn't.

25:07.893 --> 25:09.892
And that gap

25:09.893 --> 25:13.103
between who he wanted to be
and who he really was

25:14.893 --> 25:15.893
cost him his powers.

25:17.893 --> 25:21.893
It's very hard to know
who we really are.

25:23.893 --> 25:25.893
The secret to doing everything

25:25.894 --> 25:28.892
that you are capable of

25:28.893 --> 25:33.186
is to understand
how little time we have.

25:34.894 --> 25:38.770
We're all of us merely here,
then gone.

25:38.893 --> 25:39.893
I know what I am.

25:41.770 --> 25:42.893
I'm a Power.

25:45.893 --> 25:47.893
I just don't have my powers yet.

25:49.893 --> 25:54.892
And Olympia was gross
and old, and whatever...

25:54.893 --> 25:57.853
I thought it would help
turn my powers on.

25:59.893 --> 26:01.893
I didn't feel anything.

26:03.893 --> 26:06.603
Can Bug, maybe,

26:06.728 --> 26:08.893
introduce me to someone else?

26:09.311 --> 26:10.892
So I can try again?

26:10.893 --> 26:13.893
Bug doesn't work for me anymore.

26:15.893 --> 26:17.353
He broke the rules.

26:19.770 --> 26:21.892
You'll have to
stay here for now.

26:21.893 --> 26:22.893
But it's boring here.

26:22.977 --> 26:25.893
It's not as boring as jail.

26:26.893 --> 26:29.893
I'll find you
a better place soon.

26:30.144 --> 26:31.893
A home, if you like.

26:37.893 --> 26:41.892
Well, I may have lost Bug,

26:41.893 --> 26:44.603
but it seems I've gained
a true friend, I hope.

26:53.893 --> 26:55.892
His heart exploded.

26:55.893 --> 26:57.395
Like a heart attack?

26:58.893 --> 27:00.812
Like a bomb.

27:01.893 --> 27:02.892
Boom.

27:02.893 --> 27:04.853
He was on a ton of shit.

27:04.893 --> 27:07.892
Maybe there was
a weird interaction that...

27:07.893 --> 27:10.892
A weird interaction?

27:10.893 --> 27:13.892
Sure, yeah, cocaine could
have blown up his heart.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.892
So might a bee sting
or a solar flare.

27:15.893 --> 27:18.892
He could be vulnerable
to pussy for all I know.

27:18.893 --> 27:20.892
All I want is for science
to work right.

27:20.893 --> 27:22.892
- But the Powers fuck that up!
- Hey, Doc.

27:22.893 --> 27:26.645
I got you a triple shot,
red-eye espresso.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.893
Oh, praise God.

27:34.893 --> 27:35.893
Ahh.

27:37.893 --> 27:41.019
Yes. Well, all that aside,
there was something weird.

27:42.893 --> 27:44.894
Whatever was in this
envelope you found

31:09.893 --> 31:11.936
Here, it's on The Powers
That Used To Be app.

31:13.893 --> 31:16.892
Really, I thought all the Kidz were
into Supershock.

31:16.893 --> 31:18.893
I like vintage.

31:19.893 --> 31:21.893
And you were hot.

31:22.893 --> 31:23.893
Uh...

31:27.269 --> 31:29.893
She's a Retro Girl fan.

31:30.893 --> 31:32.893
Into vintage like you.

31:33.893 --> 31:34.893
You know her?

31:37.893 --> 31:39.892
Her name's Calista.

31:39.893 --> 31:41.892
Just a Wannabe.
She hangs out sometimes.

31:41.893 --> 31:43.893
Okay, call me if you see her?

31:44.893 --> 31:45.893
What's your number?

31:46.893 --> 31:47.892
323...

31:47.893 --> 31:50.103
Call me if you see her, yeah?
Powers Division.

31:51.893 --> 31:53.892
Thank you.

31:53.893 --> 31:54.893
Sure, any time.

31:54.977 --> 31:56.893
My name's Zora.

31:56.977 --> 31:58.686
Zora.

31:59.893 --> 32:01.893
See you around if you
know where to find me.

32:02.893 --> 32:04.853
Here and Gone.

32:04.893 --> 32:06.893
Keep those powers in your pants.

32:10.893 --> 32:12.728
Classy, Walker.

32:12.893 --> 32:13.892
She recognized me.

32:13.893 --> 32:15.893
And you worked her
for her number.

32:17.893 --> 32:19.893
I worked her for a name.

32:20.228 --> 32:21.893
Calista.

32:27.893 --> 32:29.892
Shit!

32:29.893 --> 32:30.893
Whoa, what?

32:32.893 --> 32:33.893
That girl.

32:34.893 --> 32:36.892
She said,
"Here and gone."

32:36.893 --> 32:38.892
Royalle, when he
used his powers,

32:38.893 --> 32:40.892
he used to say,
"Here and gone."

32:40.893 --> 32:42.893
His catch phrase.

32:43.893 --> 32:45.892
Okay, I get it.

32:45.893 --> 32:47.892
We got one girl disappearing

32:47.893 --> 32:49.893
and another using
Royalle's tag line.

32:50.893 --> 32:52.892
Everyone says Royalle is dead.

32:52.893 --> 32:55.893
Okay, Wolfe ate Royalle, yeah?

32:56.645 --> 32:57.770
Yeah.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.893
<i>Christian?</i>

33:01.893 --> 33:03.892
Walker.

33:03.893 --> 33:06.103
Walker, you okay?

33:08.893 --> 33:10.893
Wolfe ate Royalle.
Yeah.

33:11.893 --> 33:12.894
I need to talk to Wolfe.

33:22.893 --> 33:24.892
It's half a kilometer
straight down.

33:24.893 --> 33:26.893
Your ears might pop,
just so you know.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.893
I just gotta say it's such an honor
to meet you, sir.

33:43.893 --> 33:44.892
Thank you.

33:44.893 --> 33:46.892
I was such a fan.

33:46.893 --> 33:49.892
I saw Diamond, saw you fight Pulp
this one time.

33:49.893 --> 33:51.436
You remember?
You put this move on him.

33:51.603 --> 33:52.892
It was so crazy.
Man, I...

33:52.893 --> 33:54.892
Yeah, I've fought Pulp
a few times.

33:54.893 --> 33:56.892
Yeah. Yeah, this way.
Through there?

33:56.893 --> 33:58.892
So you guys here
to see the show?

33:58.893 --> 34:02.645
What?
That's the only visitors he gets.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.892
It's a real trip when
they do the lobotomy.

34:04.893 --> 34:05.893
"Lobotomy?"

34:10.893 --> 34:12.893
That doesn't look good.

34:21.893 --> 34:22.893
Oh, Jesus.

34:26.893 --> 34:27.893
Wait for it.

34:28.603 --> 34:29.891
Aah.

34:29.893 --> 34:33.893
Oh, the flowers.

34:35.893 --> 34:37.893
Oh, God.

34:38.893 --> 34:41.812
It's the same thing
every single time.

34:41.893 --> 34:42.891
Give me that.

34:42.893 --> 34:43.893
He's not a fucking toy!

34:44.893 --> 34:45.893
Back up.

34:50.893 --> 34:52.891
Are you in there, old man?

34:52.893 --> 34:54.143
He's gonna wake up.

34:54.311 --> 34:55.893
And that spike is the only thing
to shut off his brain.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.893
We need his brain on.

34:59.893 --> 35:02.893
Tell me about Johnny Royalle.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.893
Royalle?

35:07.645 --> 35:08.892
Yeah.

35:08.893 --> 35:11.893
What happened to Royalle?

35:13.893 --> 35:15.893
Did you kill him?

35:16.893 --> 35:17.893
Johnny.

35:19.977 --> 35:21.893
Johnny.

35:22.686 --> 35:25.892
He was right there,

35:25.893 --> 35:27.892
in front of me.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.311
- Sir, move away from the prisoner.
- One fucking second.

35:30.436 --> 35:32.892
Okay. He was
in front of you?

35:32.893 --> 35:34.892
And then what happened?
He was right there.

35:34.893 --> 35:39.892
And then he went away.
And left me.

35:39.893 --> 35:42.892
Over and over.

35:42.893 --> 35:44.893
Sir, move away
from the prisoner!

35:44.894 --> 35:46.893
- What do you mean he went away?
- Oh, fuck.

35:46.893 --> 35:47.893
Is he alive?

35:49.893 --> 35:51.892
Is Royalle alive?

35:51.893 --> 35:52.893
Christian.

35:53.893 --> 35:55.144
He's waking up.
Take him out.

35:56.561 --> 35:58.892
Clear the field of fire, now!

35:58.893 --> 36:01.728
I never should have
taken it away from you.

36:02.853 --> 36:04.892
You can have everything back.

36:04.893 --> 36:06.893
Just get me out of here.

36:08.893 --> 36:10.892
Christian.

36:10.893 --> 36:11.893
Last chance, sir.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.936
It's your own fault
they're all dead.

36:21.812 --> 36:22.893
I can't...

36:22.977 --> 36:25.893
Sir, move away
from the prisoner!

36:28.893 --> 36:29.893
Fuck.

36:30.893 --> 36:31.893
Lovely one.

36:38.893 --> 36:39.893
What the hell was that?

36:40.893 --> 36:42.892
Unlock the car.
What did he mean?

36:42.893 --> 36:43.936
Unlock this fucking door.

36:44.061 --> 36:45.892
"I never should
have taken them"?

36:45.893 --> 36:48.892
Give me those fucking keys.

36:48.893 --> 36:50.353
"You can have them all back?"

36:50.520 --> 36:51.892
My powers!

36:51.893 --> 36:52.892
Okay?

36:52.893 --> 36:54.893
He has my fucking powers!

36:56.893 --> 36:57.893
Shit!

37:01.395 --> 37:02.893
It's unlocked.

37:15.893 --> 37:19.186
When Royalle
and I first came here,

37:19.353 --> 37:21.893
Wolfe was our teacher.

37:22.893 --> 37:23.936
Oh, shit.

37:24.103 --> 37:26.892
Listen, it was
different then, okay?

37:26.893 --> 37:31.892
Wolfe was this rock-star
philosopher badass.

37:31.893 --> 37:33.892
But you put Wolfe away.

37:33.893 --> 37:35.892
Goddamn right, I did.

37:35.893 --> 37:36.893
He went crazy.

37:37.893 --> 37:39.892
He killed my friends.

37:39.893 --> 37:41.892
I caught him. Sure. Fuck.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.893
And then Royalle broke him out.

37:45.893 --> 37:48.893
Never proved,
but no one else could have.

37:50.478 --> 37:52.892
That was the
Sky Terrace Massacre.

37:52.893 --> 37:54.892
Five-hundred and
sixty-seven people.

37:54.893 --> 37:57.892
Wolfe consumed them.

37:57.893 --> 37:59.893
I tried to stop him again,
but he...

38:00.893 --> 38:02.893
He fucking tried to eat me.

38:05.893 --> 38:06.893
And he...

38:12.893 --> 38:14.893
He still has my powers.

38:29.893 --> 38:30.893
Fuck!

39:15.812 --> 39:17.893
I had a really great time, Walker.
Call me again?

39:26.893 --> 39:29.894
You know, I asked
for Powers Division.

39:30.061 --> 39:31.893
I asked to work with you.

39:32.893 --> 39:35.892
No cop in the world knows
what you know.

39:35.893 --> 39:38.893
No one else can teach me
how a Power thinks.

39:40.893 --> 39:42.893
And I think you and I

39:43.893 --> 39:46.892
could make a really good team.

39:46.893 --> 39:48.893
Get the fuck out of my car.

40:07.353 --> 40:08.478
Hey, Diamond.

40:08.893 --> 40:09.892
Hey.

40:09.893 --> 40:10.892
<i>What's up?</i>

40:10.893 --> 40:13.520
Nothing.
Just thought I'd call.

40:13.977 --> 40:15.893
Uh-huh?

40:16.893 --> 40:18.893
Thought maybe you
put eyes on Calista?

40:21.893 --> 40:22.893
No.

40:23.893 --> 40:24.893
No?

40:26.269 --> 40:28.893
So, whatcha doin'?

40:29.893 --> 40:30.893
Hangin'.

40:31.893 --> 40:33.892
Yeah. Where?

40:33.893 --> 40:36.892
<i>Powers' crib.
It's on O'Dell and 7th.</i>

40:36.893 --> 40:39.892
<i>Yeah, I know it.
See you in five.</i>

40:39.893 --> 40:40.893
<i>Great, I'll be here.</i>

40:55.893 --> 40:57.893
You're a bad girl.

41:04.436 --> 41:06.893
Got my ass rousted by
Powers-D 'cause of you.

41:10.893 --> 41:12.893
It was Diamond.

41:13.893 --> 41:15.892
Walker.

41:15.893 --> 41:16.893
That's his real name.

41:19.893 --> 41:22.103
Diamond is his real name.

41:22.228 --> 41:25.893
Powers, we choose
our real names.

41:27.893 --> 41:29.893
It's part of what makes us
what we are.

41:31.893 --> 41:33.561
How we're different.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.311
Better.

41:42.893 --> 41:44.892
You don't belong here.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.893
Little Wannabe.

42:33.893 --> 42:35.893
Nothing up my sleeve.

42:39.893 --> 42:41.311
Diamond.

42:42.893 --> 42:43.893
Retro Girl.

42:46.893 --> 42:47.893
Olympia.

42:48.893 --> 42:50.893
Triphammer.

42:52.893 --> 42:53.893
Wolfe.

42:55.478 --> 42:56.893
Johnny Royalle.

43:01.645 --> 43:02.893
Olympia.

43:08.561 --> 43:09.893
Rest in peace.

43:30.936 --> 43:32.893
Olympia dying, killing Bug.

43:32.936 --> 43:34.892
It's too much exposure.

43:34.893 --> 43:36.892
We can't wait.
We'll start tonight.

43:36.893 --> 43:39.893
I'll see the supplier.
I'll make more Sway.

43:41.893 --> 43:43.893
We should do something
about the girl.

43:44.893 --> 43:45.893
Simons.

43:46.894 --> 43:49.893
In what circumstances
did we find each other?

43:51.728 --> 43:52.892
The girl's not a risk.

43:52.893 --> 43:54.893
She's lost.
She needs a home.

43:56.186 --> 43:58.893
What are we building here
if not a home?

44:09.893 --> 44:11.893
Shit.

44:15.893 --> 44:17.144
Hey.

44:17.269 --> 44:18.853
Hey.

44:19.893 --> 44:21.893
This is not your
usual scene, huh?

44:23.893 --> 44:25.892
Kids have been squatting here

44:25.893 --> 44:27.892
since my day.
Hmm.

44:27.893 --> 44:30.893
I carved my initials
upstairs somewhere.

44:33.061 --> 44:34.893
You wanna show me?

44:35.893 --> 44:37.893
I know what's upstairs.

44:39.893 --> 44:41.892
Hey, man.
Hey.

44:41.893 --> 44:43.893
Mmm.
You missed the Wannabe.

44:45.893 --> 44:47.561
Oh, shit.

44:47.686 --> 44:48.893
She booked on out of here.

44:53.893 --> 44:54.893
Diamond.

44:55.893 --> 44:57.436
Can you wait? Diamond.

45:00.186 --> 45:01.892
Why didn't you tell me
she was here?

45:01.893 --> 45:02.893
Because I...

45:02.894 --> 45:05.892
What the fuck were you thinking?

45:05.893 --> 45:07.893
I wanted to see you.

45:09.893 --> 45:10.893
Where did she go?

45:12.893 --> 45:14.892
She ran away. I don't know.
Oh, perfect.

45:14.893 --> 45:15.977
But you could stay.

45:17.893 --> 45:19.893
Or we could go to your place.

45:21.893 --> 45:23.893
Go back inside, little girl.

45:25.893 --> 45:27.144
Calista was right.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.893
Your real name is Walker.

45:32.893 --> 45:36.061
Like, as in one who walks because
he can't fly anymore.

45:51.893 --> 45:52.893
Shit.

46:10.893 --> 46:11.893
You were right.

46:12.893 --> 46:14.893
She does hang out here.

46:15.893 --> 46:17.892
I can feel her.

46:17.893 --> 46:18.893
Yeah?

46:19.893 --> 46:20.893
What does that feel like?

46:21.893 --> 46:22.893
Safe.

46:25.893 --> 46:27.561
Being here...

46:27.893 --> 46:29.893
It's like I am Retro Girl.

46:30.893 --> 46:32.893
Whoo.

46:36.853 --> 46:38.893
She's not who you
think she is, you know?

46:39.893 --> 46:41.892
None of the Powers are.

46:41.893 --> 46:45.892
They're weak.
Their powers make them weak.

46:45.893 --> 46:47.186
They stop growing, stop trying,

46:47.353 --> 46:49.892
because they don't have to.

46:49.893 --> 46:51.353
You don't want to be like that.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.892
You don't understand.

46:54.893 --> 46:56.892
You had powers.

46:56.893 --> 46:58.893
You just fell
and you found your powers.

46:59.893 --> 47:00.893
It's not fair.

47:03.893 --> 47:05.853
You just fell.

47:06.893 --> 47:09.144
Yeah, but I lost
my powers, Calista.

47:10.436 --> 47:11.893
I'm just like you.

47:12.893 --> 47:16.311
You're a normal kid,
and that is okay.

47:17.478 --> 47:18.893
It's okay.

47:21.893 --> 47:23.478
I could be a real hero.

47:24.893 --> 47:25.893
You think?

47:35.893 --> 47:38.561
You think you know
what that means?

47:39.893 --> 47:42.892
You think you can
always be there in the nick of time,

47:42.893 --> 47:44.894
make the right choice?

47:47.893 --> 47:50.893
'Cause when you don't,
you blame yourself.

47:51.893 --> 47:54.893
And you live with it every day.

47:56.936 --> 47:58.893
Come on.

47:59.893 --> 48:01.893
Let's get out of here.

48:03.228 --> 48:04.893
You and me.

48:05.893 --> 48:06.893
Normal.

48:08.686 --> 48:09.893
Like everybody else.

48:11.019 --> 48:13.893
I don't want to be
like everybody else.

48:14.893 --> 48:15.893
No!

48:16.893 --> 48:17.893
Shit.

48:30.893 --> 48:32.893
I got you. Hold on.

48:33.893 --> 48:34.893
Come on!

48:37.645 --> 48:39.395
I'm sorry.
I can't, I can't.

48:40.269 --> 48:41.686
Shit.

48:43.893 --> 48:44.893
Aah!

48:52.893 --> 48:54.892
Christian.

48:54.893 --> 48:56.893
You stupid son of a bitch.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.893
<i>How does it feel, Christian?</i>

49:45.893 --> 49:48.893
<i>How does it feel
to be powerless?</i>
