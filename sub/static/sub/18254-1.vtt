It's not lit. It's just
something I do for stress.

03:18.298 --> 03:19.433

03:19.533 --> 03:22.636
Why are you smoking a cigar, when you're
supposed to be delivering a baby?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.871
That's the kind of stress
he's talking about, madam.

03:24.971 --> 03:25.939

08:20.633 --> 08:23.313
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
"That's him. That has to be Martin."

08:23.837 --> 08:25.338

there was people freaking out
over by the merchandise table.

over to Martin, screaming. (SCREAMS)

"but she thought I was someone else."

got recognized."

09:43.349 --> 09:45.418
since the last time we've been
here in the Bay, you guys.

like our decorations here.

Oh, yeah.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.534
Since the last time we've been here,
a couple of things have changed,

10:01.634 --> 10:06.112
one of which is I am
officially down 100 pounds.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.910
Yeah.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.781
Whew.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.683
I know some of you here in the front
are looking at me right now like,

10:16.783 --> 10:18.621
"Well, how big were you?"

10:19.419 --> 10:21.621
I know. (LAUGHS)
"Hercules, Hercules."

10:21.721 --> 10:23.457
Yeah...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.693
Anyways, you guys,
let me tell you what happened.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.129
Basically I found our
I was a little sick.

10:29.229 --> 10:32.332
I was diagnosed about two
years ago, type 2 diabetic.

10:32.432 --> 10:36.045
Now, I maxed out at 445 pounds.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.472
Yeah, that's way past fluffy, okay?

10:39.572 --> 10:42.548
Let's be honest.
That's not even, "Damn!"

10:42.775 --> 10:47.219
445 pounds, that's borderline
Discovery Channel fat.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.861
That was like, "I couldn't
leave the house." Yeah?

10:52.418 --> 10:54.320
(MIMICS TRUCK BEEPING)

10:54.420 --> 10:56.896
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
"He wants to go to the movies."

10:58.258 --> 10:59.492
It was really bad, you guys,

10:59.592 --> 11:04.673
and so I was waking up every
morning with a 300-plus sugar level.

11:04.964 --> 11:08.501
Now, anyone who knows anything
about diabetes, that is super high.

11:08.601 --> 11:11.371
And you do that enough times,
and eventually... (CHUCKLES)

11:11.471 --> 11:12.911
"Clear."

11:13.673 --> 11:16.342
(SINGING) It's so hard

11:16.442 --> 11:19.316
To say goodbye

11:19.445 --> 11:22.319
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
"They buried him in frosting.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.785
"It was the sweetest funeral ever.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.157
"Everyone got a cupcake.
It was the shit. It was so nice."

11:30.957 --> 11:33.626
Im at the doctor's office,
you guys, and the doctor tells me.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.896
He says, "Listen, Gabriel,
you're 445 pounds.

11:36.996 --> 11:39.966
"Your weight is out of control.
"Your diabetes is out of control.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.201
"You're 35 years old.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.370
"You will not live another
two years. I guarantee it."

11:44.470 --> 11:46.739
And I got very emotional, you know,
I was like, "Are you serious?"

11:46.839 --> 11:49.275
He goes, "Two years tops."

11:49.375 --> 11:52.749
And I was like, "But I just
started making money."

11:55.315 --> 11:56.950
"Well, it's going to
be a nice funeral."

11:57.050 --> 11:59.355
I was like, "What an ass."

11:59.919 --> 12:02.422
So it took a lot for me to finally
start doing something about it,

12:02.522 --> 12:04.724
'cause it's not like this is the
first time I tried to lose weight.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.226
This has been happening
for a long time,

12:06.326 --> 12:09.095
but somebody tells you you're
gonna die, you actually wake up.

12:09.195 --> 12:12.599
So what it took was it took the
support of my friends, my family,

12:12.699 --> 12:15.802
and, you know, especially I got to
give credit where credit is due.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.171
Martin, you guys,
helped me out so much,

12:18.271 --> 12:21.574
because he's always encouraging
me to go to the gym.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.820
"Let's go work out, bro.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.620
"Let's go do something."

12:27.046 --> 12:29.149
And more importantly than,
"Let's go work out, " is,

12:29.249 --> 12:31.818
you know, we're on the road
together 46 weeks out of the year,

12:31.918 --> 12:34.654
so we eat together a lot,
and he's always watching what I eat,

12:34.754 --> 12:36.422
and if he sees me
reaching for something

12:36.522 --> 12:38.591
I shouldn't mess with, he checks me.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.927
Especially breakfast.
That's my favorite meal.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.295
I love breakfast.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.197
And they always put us
at these nice hotels,

12:44.297 --> 12:45.865
where they give us this
continental breakfast

12:45.965 --> 12:47.300
with the buffet, and, you know,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.603
if I'm eating eggs and bacon
and sausage, that's fine.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.672
Yes, some of it's fattening,
but guess what.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.274
No sugar.

12:54.374 --> 12:59.648
If Martin sees me reaching for muffins
or waffles, he makes a scene.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.615
He waits for me to get
about 15 feet away,

13:02.715 --> 13:03.816
and he starts yelling

13:03.916 --> 13:06.486
in front of all the
people at the restaurant.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.959
Oh, yeah. He's still ghetto.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.390
Uh-huh.

13:10.490 --> 13:14.029
I don't care if it's a Ritz-Carlton.
Guess what? "Machete" is here.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.963
He starts yelling.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.971
He waits for me to get 15 feet
away, and then he starts.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.935
"Really, bro?

13:22.302 --> 13:25.038
"You're going to put that
in your mouth, Fluffy?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.473
"You know what that's
going to do to your body?

13:27.573 --> 13:30.151
"Hey! Have some self-respect."

13:31.411 --> 13:33.989
And he makes me cry at breakfast.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.683
I'm sad. I'm like,
"I don't want the muffin.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.985
(CRYING) "I don't want it.
I don't want the muffin.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.887
"I'm not a little whore. I'm not.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.894
"I'm not a little whore."

13:43.790 --> 13:45.325
But, see, that is a real friend

13:45.425 --> 13:46.826
who would check me and remind me,

13:46.926 --> 13:49.970
"Hey, bro, get mad at me all you want.
I just want you to live."

13:50.263 --> 13:51.698
And I got to respect that.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.233
That's why I love
that dude, you know,

13:53.333 --> 13:56.502
and, in turn, sometimes
I got to check Martin.

13:56.602 --> 13:57.906
Yeah.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.674
Believe me, you guys.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.010
It goes both ways.
Sometimes I have to check him.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.513
Not about his weight, but he
has his demons, too, you know.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.182
Oh, believe that. Yes.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.217
Sometimes there's limited space

14:11.317 --> 14:12.852
at the hotels where we're staying at,

14:12.952 --> 14:15.121
so sometimes we gotta
double up on a room.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.091
And every now and then, Martin will
bring some random girl to the room

14:18.191 --> 14:20.393
at 3:00 in the morning, wakes me up.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.505
I got to look at him
and say, "Really, bro?

14:26.799 --> 14:29.741
"You're going to put
that in your mouth?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.612
"Do you know what that's
going to do to your body?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.620
"Hey! Have some self-re..." (LAUGHS)

14:43.216 --> 14:45.953
He doesn't. He really doesn't, so...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.055
So let me tell you guys.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.923
I'm in the doctor's office,
and he tells me.

14:51.023 --> 14:55.933
He says, "Listen, Gabriel,
obviously working out isn't cutting it.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.740
"I have a friend who
specializes in gastric bypass,

15:00.867 --> 15:02.735
"and I think it would
benefit you greatly

15:02.835 --> 15:06.773
"to at least listen to what the
guy has to say. It couldn't hurt."

15:06.873 --> 15:08.107
So he hands me a card.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.877
The card says, "BH Surgical Center."

15:12.178 --> 15:14.747
I make an appointment.
I show up to this place.

15:14.847 --> 15:15.915
I get to the door.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.784
The door doesn't say,

15:17.884 --> 15:20.153
"BH Surgical Center."

15:20.253 --> 15:21.754
It actually says,

15:21.854 --> 15:24.933
"Center for the Morbidly Obese."

15:26.359 --> 15:28.630
Yeah. That shit's not cure.

15:29.695 --> 15:33.099
So I figure I'm there, I might as
well check it out, so I walk in.

15:33.199 --> 15:37.203
I go over to the receptionist,
and I ask, "Um, right spot?"

15:37.303 --> 15:38.705
And she was cool. She was like,

15:38.805 --> 15:41.815
"Yes, sir, you're in
the right location."

15:42.041 --> 15:45.255
(NORMAL VOICE) "Can I ask you something?"
(IN FEMALE VOICE) "Absolutely."

15:45.478 --> 15:46.546
(NORMAL VOICE) "Why does it say,

15:46.646 --> 15:49.315
"Center for the Morbidly
Obese' on the door?"

15:49.415 --> 15:51.651
"The doctors prefer it that way."

15:51.751 --> 15:53.453
"Why don't you have
that on the card?"

15:53.553 --> 15:56.029
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
"'Cause then you won't come in.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.359
"First time?"

15:59.459 --> 16:00.660
"Yeah, first time."

16:00.760 --> 16:02.829
So she hands me a clipboard,
and she goes,

16:02.929 --> 16:04.831
"Please take this clipboard,
and have a seat.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.466
"They'll call you in a few minutes."

16:06.566 --> 16:08.901
So I turn around, and I
sit down on this couch,

16:09.001 --> 16:10.670
and I start filling
out the paperwork.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.306
And it wasn't like insurance
forms and stuff like that.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.475
It was actually more of
like a questionnaire.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.043
They ask you a bunch of questions,

16:17.143 --> 16:19.479
and you have to answer from one to 10

16:19.579 --> 16:21.814
how unhealthy you think you are,

16:21.914 --> 16:23.716
and it's not going good. It's not.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.885
I'm like, "Uh, frigging eight,
eight, nine, nine, nine, nine,

16:25.985 --> 16:27.320
"10, nine, nine, 10, nine,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.322
"10,10,10,10,10,10,10."

16:29.422 --> 16:34.037
And as I'm filling our the paperwork,
outside the door, I hear...

16:44.604 --> 16:46.078

16:47.507 --> 16:49.175
All of a sudden, the door opens up,

16:49.275 --> 16:51.511
and this dude walks in...

17:02.321 --> 17:04.057

17:05.324 --> 17:08.334
I was like, "Oh, my God!
You're morbid."

17:09.962 --> 17:12.698
Immediately, my score got better.

17:12.798 --> 17:13.933
I'm like, "Shoot.

"I'm healthy by default."

17:19.839 --> 17:21.540
(ALL LAUGHING)

17:21.641 --> 17:23.476
He makes his way over
to the receptionist,

17:23.576 --> 17:26.712
and she's like,
"Are you here for the 8:30?"

17:26.811 --> 17:28.286
(SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY)

17:30.149 --> 17:32.385
"Is this your first time here?"

17:32.485 --> 17:34.596
(SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY)

17:38.090 --> 17:41.100
"Because the doctors
prefer it that way."

17:42.995 --> 17:45.064
(SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY)

17:45.164 --> 17:48.607
"'Cause then you won't

17:53.573 --> 17:54.807
(SPEAKS INCOHERENTLY)

17:54.907 --> 17:56.476
So he turns around,

17:56.576 --> 17:59.484
and he looks at me and my sofa,

18:00.446 --> 18:02.057
and he's like...

18:02.348 --> 18:04.425
(WAILS)

18:05.017 --> 18:09.233
I swear it was like the opening

He's like... (WAILS)

18:12.058 --> 18:14.397

18:48.394 --> 18:49.962
He turns around,

18:50.062 --> 18:51.964
and he lines himself
up with the sofa,

18:52.064 --> 18:54.667
and he starts doing this
little shuffle backwards.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.570
Now keep in mind I see this
coming towards me, right?

18:57.670 --> 18:58.804
He's like...

19:01.807 --> 19:03.309

the back of his knees

19:03.409 --> 19:05.978
hit the edge of the couch,
and you hear the click.

19:11.283 --> 19:14.123
And he hit. And I was like, "Whoa!"

19:16.589 --> 19:18.324
And at that moment,
they call me in, you know.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.493
(IN FEMALE VOICE) "Mr. Iglesias."
(IN NORMAL VOICE) "Hey, wish me luck."

19:20.593 --> 19:22.033
(SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY)

19:22.294 --> 19:25.164
So I walk into the office.
I'm greeted by a nurse.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.666
The nurse is really nice.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.669
In addition to being nice,
she's actually a fan,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.504
which made it so much better for me.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.005
She comes over, and she's like,

19:33.105 --> 19:35.841
"Mr. Iglesias, this is such an honor.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.044
"I'm such a huge fan.

19:38.144 --> 19:41.723
"I am going to make this

19:42.448 --> 19:44.491
"I have to weigh you."

19:45.451 --> 19:47.853
I'm like, "You know what? I'm good.
I weighed myself at the house.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.895
"I'm 445 pounds. I'm good."

19:51.323 --> 19:53.525
"I have to confirm that."

19:53.793 --> 19:57.338
And in my head, I'm like,
"Why would I make that up?"

19:58.464 --> 20:00.733
You know what I mean?
Like, if you're 200 pounds

20:00.833 --> 20:04.036
and you lie and say
you're 195, I get it,

20:04.136 --> 20:06.405
but once you achieve
a certain level of...

20:06.505 --> 20:08.685

20:08.974 --> 20:10.619
It's pretty clear.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.212
So I said, "Fine. Where's it at?"

20:13.312 --> 20:15.214
"Excuse me?" "Where's it at?
Where's the scale?"

20:15.314 --> 20:16.983
Because I want to
walk up to the scale,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.718
so I can grab the stupid brick,

20:18.818 --> 20:21.554
pick it up, slide it all the way
to the end, and put it down.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.322
You know the scale I'm
talking about, right?

20:23.422 --> 20:25.257
The one that has that heavy arm,
where you get on,

20:25.357 --> 20:27.036
and it's loud? (THUDS)

20:28.260 --> 20:29.729
I call it the "Scale Nazi."

Mmm-hmm.

20:37.703 --> 20:38.904

20:39.004 --> 20:41.674
She goes, "Mr. Iglesias,
you are so silly.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.614
"Actually, our scale is industrial."

20:48.347 --> 20:51.017

the word "industrial"

20:51.117 --> 20:54.127

20:55.588 --> 20:58.491
She goes, "Mr. Iglesias,
it's built directly into the floor.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.992
"Stand on the little X."

presses it and it was actually cute.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.136
So then she walks me
into the doctor's office.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.638
I sit down. Doctor walks in,

21:45.738 --> 21:47.139
and we spoke for an hour.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.076
In a nutshell, what he says is
that he wants to take my stomach,

21:50.176 --> 21:53.479
which, in his opinion, is the
size of an NFL football,

21:53.579 --> 21:56.816
and he wants to cut it and make
it the size of a hard-boiled egg.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.884
Therefore, you only eat this much,

21:58.984 --> 22:00.820
and you lose weight with time.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.655
Problem with gastric bypass is that

22:02.755 --> 22:05.991
if you don't stick to their
program religiously,

22:06.091 --> 22:07.660
not only will you not lose weight,

22:07.760 --> 22:09.228
you will gain weight,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.163
and you'll have a series
of complications.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.566
And then he asked,
"Do you travel a lot?"

22:13.666 --> 22:16.235
I'm like, "I'm on the road
46 weeks out of the year."

22:16.335 --> 22:17.703
He goes, "This is not
going to work for you."

22:17.803 --> 22:19.983
I'm like, "I agree. I like two eggs."

22:20.206 --> 22:21.885
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:22.341 --> 22:23.409
I said, "Well, what should I do?"

22:23.509 --> 22:25.244
He goes, "I don't know,
but this isn't going to work."

22:25.344 --> 22:27.513
So I left the office.
I was bummed out, you guys.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.681
I get in my car.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.182
I was so depressed, because I'm like,

22:30.282 --> 22:31.751
"Someone told me I
got two years to live.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.187
"Surgery is my last hope."
And so I started crying.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.722
I was sad. I was in
the car. I'm crying.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.357
I'm like, "What the
hell am I going to do?"

22:38.457 --> 22:42.161
And the only thing that could
cheer me up was a drive-through.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.363
And I know that sounds crazy.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.365
Some of you are like,
"Isn't that what got you

22:46.465 --> 22:48.300
"in that position to begin with?"

22:48.400 --> 22:50.970
Yes! But it's the only
thing that made sense.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.805
There's a reason why it's called

22:52.905 --> 22:55.207
"comfort food." Think about that.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.143
Any time you see someone
eating a burger,

22:57.243 --> 23:00.014
they never look sad.
They always look happy.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.449
you might look sad walking out,

eating a burger is happening,

23:06.585 --> 23:08.765

(MOUTHING)

23:36.048 --> 23:38.918
Think about it. Who's sad when
they're eating fast food?

23:39.018 --> 23:39.952
I'll tell you who's sad,

23:40.052 --> 23:42.588
the person eating a salad,
watching someone eat fast food.

23:42.688 --> 23:45.090
That's who's sad. You know?

23:45.190 --> 23:49.270
So I pull up to this fast-food
restaurant with a big "M" on it.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.431
And the guy on the speaker's like,
you know, "May I help you?"

23:52.531 --> 23:55.769
And I'm crying. I'm like,
"You have no idea."

23:56.769 --> 24:01.307
What I eventually wound up doing,
you guys, is I started low-carbing.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.343
Now, I am not eating
healthy by no means, okay?

24:04.443 --> 24:08.314
I still eat fast food every single day,
and people question it.

24:08.414 --> 24:11.483
"How do you eat fast food
and lose 100 pounds?"

24:11.583 --> 24:13.118
I'll give you an example.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.888
I'll go to a burger place,
and I'll order a double cheeseburger.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.122
I won't eat the bread.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.958
I won't eat the onions,
the tomato, the ketchup.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.060
I'll eat the meat, the cheese,
the mayo, the mustard,

24:21.160 --> 24:23.966
and I'll order up to three with,
like, three diet sodas.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.365
And people go, "That's unhealthy.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.500
"The cholesterol's gonna kill you."

24:28.600 --> 24:31.370
I agree. But guess what?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.472
Cholesterol's gonna take
10 years to kill me.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.007
Diabetes is going to do it in two.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.843
Right now, I'm winning by eight.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.548
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

24:43.349 --> 24:46.223
Hell, yeah. That's called
"Fluffy math," bro.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.320
There's a lot of people
mad in here right now.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.066
"Fluffy found a loophole." Yes.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.025
So I started low-carbing.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.595
I started doing yoga and I know
that sounds like a joke right there.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.664
Yeah, some of you are like,
"He means yogurt."

24:58.764 --> 25:01.367
No, yoga. Frigging DDP, help me.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.836
And then, uh, I started
lifting weights.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.604
And it's kind of hard
for me, you guys,

25:05.704 --> 25:07.907
because now I have people
at my shows telling me,

25:08.007 --> 25:10.009
"We're noticing there's
a little difference.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.044
"You're a little less fluffy.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.713
"What's going to happen
if you keep losing weight?

25:14.813 --> 25:16.181
"What are we going to call you?

25:16.281 --> 25:17.516
"What are we going to call you?"

25:17.616 --> 25:20.524
I lift weights. Call me
"Buffy." I don't care.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.690
The point is, is that I'm not trying
to lose weight for vanity's sake.

25:24.790 --> 25:25.858
I'm very secure.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.526
The point is that I'm
trying to lose weight

25:27.626 --> 25:30.396
so I can be around for my family,
so I can be around for my friends,

25:30.496 --> 25:32.598
and so I can be around for you.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.502
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

25:41.473 --> 25:43.108
I'm not trying to preach to nobody.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.643
"This is what you got
to do with your life."

25:44.743 --> 25:45.978
Hell, no. Shoot,
you like burgers? Kill it.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.621
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

25:48.380 --> 25:50.716
I'm just saying that's what I'm
going through. And then people think,

25:50.816 --> 25:53.719
"Oh, he's trying to lose weight,
because he's doing movies.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.989
"He wants to look better.
He wants to be accepted.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.391
"He wants to be accep..."
No, no, no, no.

25:59.491 --> 26:01.727
Don't get it twisted, you guys.
Don't even think that.

26:01.827 --> 26:05.230
At my highest weight of 445 pounds,

26:05.330 --> 26:09.234
the level of acceptance I
had was amazing, okay?

26:09.334 --> 26:11.170
To put it to you like this...

26:11.270 --> 26:12.574
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

26:14.206 --> 26:15.741
To put it to you like this,

26:15.841 --> 26:18.010
at 445 pounds,

26:18.110 --> 26:20.679
there was women throwing
themselves at me.

26:20.779 --> 26:23.050
At 445 pounds,

26:23.749 --> 26:25.485
there was men.

26:27.719 --> 26:32.061
Oh, and, Bay Area, let me tell
you something about gay men.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.832
I know you're in here.
I saw the line.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.164
I'm going to tell you
something about gay men.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.300
Gay men are very creative.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.970
They're very persistent,
and they're very opportunistic

26:45.070 --> 26:47.910
when they want to
achieve the mission.

26:49.808 --> 26:52.611
They're just as calculated
as straight men are.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.213
I'll give you an example.
I'll tell you a story, right?

26:54.313 --> 26:58.317
So one night, Martin and I are at
a bar, and we're having drinks,

26:58.417 --> 26:59.985
and that should come as no surprise.

27:00.085 --> 27:02.322
"Really? They were drinking?"
Yeah. We killed it. So...

27:03.255 --> 27:05.724
As we're drinking,
Martin is paying attention,

27:05.824 --> 27:08.460
and he's listening in to a
conversation that's happening

27:08.560 --> 27:11.397
about 15 feet away
between these two girls.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.832
They're going back and forth,
and one of 'em was like,

27:13.932 --> 27:17.569
(SLURRING) "I don't believe
we finished the whole bottle.

27:17.669 --> 27:21.442
"How the hell are we
supposed to get home?"

27:21.807 --> 27:24.810
Martin stands up,
looks at me, and says,

27:24.910 --> 27:27.454
"Bro, I'll be back."

27:28.981 --> 27:31.821
And then it began, the hunt.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.218
You know, freaking...

27:33.318 --> 27:35.293
(HUMMING THEME FROM JAWS)

27:40.993 --> 27:43.162
Gay men are the exact same way.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.497
They listen. They focus.
They pay attention.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.733
They wait for one of the cows to
get away from the rest of the herd,

27:47.833 --> 27:50.479
so they can corner it and strike.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.605
Four hours later,
Martin and I are at the bar,

27:53.705 --> 27:56.175
and I'm 16 shots of tequila in.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.242
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

27:57.342 --> 27:59.818
Oh, yeah, and I feel fantastic!

28:02.014 --> 28:04.716
And I tell Martin,
"Bro, I don't remember

28:04.816 --> 28:08.187
"the last time I had this
many shots of tequila."

28:08.287 --> 28:10.389
And Martin goes,
"Bro, you're crazy, Fluffy.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.025
"You're crazy. Wait right here.
I got to pee."

28:13.125 --> 28:14.626
And so he leaves to the restroom,

28:14.726 --> 28:16.595
and I'm leaning against the bar.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.931
The bar is the only thing
keeping me standing.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.700
And from across the room,
this guy stands up,

28:21.800 --> 28:24.970
looks at his friends,
and says, "I'll be back."

28:25.070 --> 28:26.681
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

28:36.715 --> 28:39.794
And then it began, the hunt.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.188
(HUMMING THEME FROM JAWS)

28:45.824 --> 28:47.059
(THUMPS)

28:47.159 --> 28:49.161
And he gets in my face,
and he tells me,

28:49.261 --> 28:52.397
"I just have to say I am
such a huge fan of yours.

28:52.497 --> 28:54.066
"Oh, my God!"

28:54.166 --> 28:57.436
Any time someone says
they're a huge fan of mine,

28:57.536 --> 28:59.571
it automatically makes me smile,

28:59.671 --> 29:01.908
even more so if I've been drinking.

29:02.841 --> 29:06.614
Oh, yeah, if I'm drinking,
I'm like, "Thank you. Thank you."

29:07.512 --> 29:10.716
Bro, I was so loaded,
I bowed. "Thank you."

29:16.888 --> 29:18.957
The guy puts his hand on my shoulder,

29:19.057 --> 29:20.926
and he says, "I just have to say

29:21.026 --> 29:22.828
"you have gotten me
through some difficult..."

29:22.928 --> 29:24.496
And he stops talking,

29:24.596 --> 29:28.642
and he squeezes,
and he goes, "Oh, my God!

29:30.535 --> 29:32.408
"Do you work out?"

29:34.273 --> 29:37.647
I was so drunk, I said, "A little.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.917
"You're the first person to notice!"

29:44.716 --> 29:46.151
And he's like,
"Oh, you can totally tell."

29:46.251 --> 29:48.120
And he squeezed again,
and I said... "Ahh."

29:48.220 --> 29:49.688
"I'm sorry. Am I overstepping?"

29:49.788 --> 29:51.456
"No, bro, you don't understand.

29:51.556 --> 29:54.327
"I'm stressed out.
That felt pretty good."

29:55.727 --> 29:57.029
"Want me to rub both your shoulders

29:57.129 --> 29:59.565
"and your back and scratch it?
'Cause I will."

29:59.665 --> 30:01.970
Oh. Whoa! (LAUGHS)

30:05.737 --> 30:07.280
"Hey, go for it."

30:09.574 --> 30:12.144
He grabs me by
the shoulders, you guys.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.647
He grabs me by the shoulders,
and he turns me around.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.749
Now I'm facing the bartender,

30:17.849 --> 30:20.352
and the bar-tender
is trying to warn me.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.531
The bartender's like, "Hello!

30:23.689 --> 30:25.960
"Hello!

30:26.525 --> 30:28.636
"Hello!

30:31.663 --> 30:33.638
"Hello!"

30:36.768 --> 30:39.676
I'm so drunk, I'm like... (SCREAMS)

30:41.840 --> 30:45.043
This guy is working my neck well.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.822
I'm like... (GRUNTING)

30:48.313 --> 30:51.153
It feels so good, I push off the bar.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.354
At that moment,
Martin returns from the restroom.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.089
He sees what's going on.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.591
He doesn't stop it.
He doesn't say a word.

30:59.691 --> 31:03.065
As far as I know,
"Machete" is taking notes.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.599
The guy turns me back
around, and he says,

31:07.699 --> 31:10.936
"I just have to say,
if you were mine,

31:11.036 --> 31:15.378
"I would cook for you every
single day of your life."

31:16.408 --> 31:18.977
At that moment,
Martin cuts into the conversation

31:19.077 --> 31:21.246
like a referee at the
end of a bad fight,

31:21.346 --> 31:22.781
and he hugs me, and he holds me,

31:22.881 --> 31:25.083
and he goes, "Dude,"
and I go, "Dude,"

31:25.183 --> 31:26.618
and then I looked at the guy.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.955
"Hey, what can you cook?"

31:30.255 --> 31:32.090
And Martin shook me.
"Gabriel." "What?"

31:32.190 --> 31:34.393
And he drags me away, and I go,

31:34.493 --> 31:36.795
"Martin, what are you doing, bro?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.097
"You can't do that. That's rude."

31:39.197 --> 31:41.733
He goes, "Dude, that guy was
trying to hook up with you."

31:41.833 --> 31:44.336
"No, Martin. No.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.946
"He was trying to feed me.

31:48.173 --> 31:51.081
"Why are you always
food-blocking, bro?"

31:51.543 --> 31:53.812
"I'm your friend,
I'm your friend, Gabriel."

31:53.912 --> 31:57.082
"You're not my friend!
You're not my friend!

31:57.182 --> 32:00.329
"When's the last time you
rubbed my shoulders, huh?

32:00.852 --> 32:03.755
"When's the last time you said,
'Fluffy, I'll cook for you'?

32:03.855 --> 32:07.298
"You don't cook for me!
You made me throw away muffins!"

32:09.428 --> 32:11.463
We're arguing so hard, you guys,

32:11.563 --> 32:14.073
now this guy thinks we're gay.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.169
He's like, "Oh, my God.
I'm such a home-wrecker."

32:17.269 --> 32:19.073
And then he ran.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.279
The point to that story is, (LAUGHS)

32:25.944 --> 32:29.091
I started losing weight
for health reasons.

32:30.715 --> 32:33.259
Some of you are like,
"He went a little far for that."

32:33.418 --> 32:34.858
Poquito.

32:35.654 --> 32:39.458
What I think is funny is that now
people are questioning my shows.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.494
They're like, "Well, what is
Gabriel going to talk about

32:42.594 --> 32:44.463
"if he continues to lose weight?

32:44.563 --> 32:46.208
"What's he going to talk about?"

32:46.731 --> 32:48.500
I'm like, seriously,
between the amount

32:48.600 --> 32:50.635
of crazy friends that I have

32:50.735 --> 32:53.572
and the amount of alcohol
I drink on a regular basis

32:53.672 --> 32:56.808
and the amount of crazy,
random places we visit,

32:56.908 --> 32:59.211
I will always have
stories for you guys.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.846
Random stories.

33:00.946 --> 33:02.557
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

33:08.153 --> 33:10.088
Stories no one else has.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.801
Stories like Martin and I
just got back from India.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.063
Yeah.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.931
So let me tell you, I started
posting on Facebook and Twitter

33:20.031 --> 33:22.000
that we were going to go
out there to do these shows,

33:22.100 --> 33:24.403
and then people started
sending me messages,

33:24.503 --> 33:26.171
questioning what I was going to do.

33:26.271 --> 33:30.008
First of all, "Are they gonna
understand you in India?

33:30.108 --> 33:31.910
"Will they understand English okay?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.946
"Will they be able to follow
along with your stories?"

33:35.046 --> 33:37.249
Once we got there, I come to find out

33:37.349 --> 33:40.018
that more people speak
English in India

33:40.118 --> 33:44.189
than in all of the US and
Canada put together.

33:44.289 --> 33:47.834
Might as well throw Mexico
in there for extra credit.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.728
Because there's that many people,

33:49.828 --> 33:51.430
and, yes, they have the Internet.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.732
They got the Internet.
They got Bollywood. They got Hollywood.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.901
They understand American culture

33:56.001 --> 33:58.970
so much more than we
understand theirs.

33:59.070 --> 34:02.441
Second thing, people tried to
warn me about going over there.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.812
"Gabriel, be careful.
India is a Third World country,

34:06.912 --> 34:08.713
"Don't drink the water in India.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.882
"It contains parasites that'll
make you really sick.

34:11.983 --> 34:15.554
"Don't eat the food from the street
people, especially the street meat.

"It contains a parasite
that'll make you really sick.

"And most importantly,
there's a lot of crime over there.

I'm like, "Is it that bad?"

34:49.454 --> 34:51.429
(ALL CHEERING)

34:57.862 --> 34:59.798
When Martin and I got over there,

34:59.898 --> 35:03.535
we found out that Indian
people and Mexican people

35:03.635 --> 35:05.937
have so much in common, you guys.

35:06.037 --> 35:10.709
I'm telling you it's insane how
similar we are, especially the food.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.277
The food is so similar.

35:12.377 --> 35:15.447
For example, Mexicans love tortillas.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.949
Indian people love naan bread,

35:18.049 --> 35:20.952
which is a fluffier
form of a tortilla.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.722
Mexicans love chicken.
Indians love chicken.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.557
Mexicans love hot and spicy.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.627
Indians invented hot and spicy.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.630
Most popular drink
in Mexico is Fanta.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.466
Most popular drink in India is Fanta.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.334
Indian people worship cows.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.614
Mexicans love barbecues.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.714
Lot of similarities.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.976
Most of the people
that I met over there

35:45.076 --> 35:47.479
were very hardworking and humble,

35:47.579 --> 35:50.015
and I got to tell you,
every time I talked to someone,

35:50.115 --> 35:51.650
I was always greeted the same way.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.818
They'd look at me,
they'd put their hands together,

35:53.918 --> 35:57.531
they'd do a little bow,
and they say, "Namaste,"

35:57.989 --> 35:59.991
which is an endearing hello.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.693
It's really nice and sweet.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.829
And then I noticed that Indian people,
when you're talking to them,

36:04.929 --> 36:06.498
do this thing with their head,

36:06.598 --> 36:11.338
where it will begin to move side
to side as they're speaking.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.171
Now, at first, when you
notice it, you think,

36:13.271 --> 36:15.075
"Oh, he slept wrong.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.886
"He just got a kink in his neck.
Get a Tempur-Pedic!"

36:20.278 --> 36:21.846
Now, when they start speaking,

36:21.946 --> 36:23.081
their head starts moving,
and I noticed this.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.084
The guy is checking us in to
the hotel, and he's really cool.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.753
He's like, (INDIAN ACCENT) "Listen,
if you have any problems at all, okay,

36:28.853 --> 36:30.522

you press zero.

"We will send somebody to
your room to help you.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.225
"Whatever you need, we got it for you

36:34.325 --> 36:35.927
"right here, okay? It's very good."

36:36.027 --> 36:38.363
Now, one thing I notice
is the more they talk

36:38.463 --> 36:40.865
and the more excited
Indian people get,

36:40.965 --> 36:43.468
the more the head
starts to move around.

36:43.568 --> 36:46.204
Somebody at the hotel
yelled out to the clerk,

36:46.304 --> 36:47.639
"That's Fluffy."
And the guy was like,

36:47.739 --> 36:49.074
(INDIAN ACCENT)
"Oh, my God! I don't believe it.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.376
"I knew it. I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.978
"Oh, my God! I cannot believe it.
This is so crazy.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.780
"Oh, my God, Fluffy. Fluffy! Fluffy!"

36:56.414 --> 37:01.393
Even crazier than that is that the
mouth is actually connected to the neck.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.388
When the mouth stops moving,

37:03.488 --> 37:05.991
the head stops wherever
the mouth left off.

37:06.091 --> 37:08.960
And when you see Indian people
talking to each other, you can see it.

stutter, you are so screwed.

37:28.379 --> 37:29.781
I'm not going to lie, you guys.

37:29.881 --> 37:33.893
When I first saw this happen,
I thought it was hysterical.

37:34.352 --> 37:36.187
I thought it was funny.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.123
But then I started thinking about it.

37:38.223 --> 37:41.092
Head movement is just
a form of expression.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.428
No matter where you
live in this world,

37:43.528 --> 37:47.032
people express themselves
in their own unique way,

37:47.132 --> 37:49.434
whether through facial expressions,

37:49.534 --> 37:53.038
hand gestures,
body movement, extra words.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.540
Everywhere you go,
things are different,

37:55.640 --> 37:58.810
and that's just how they
express themselves in India.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.279
Now back to the whole
Indians-Mexican thing.

38:01.379 --> 38:05.316
That is something else that we
share in common with Indian people.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.451
Head movement.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.119
Now, some of you in the
building tonight are like,

38:08.219 --> 38:10.989
"Stupid. We don't
have head movement."

38:11.089 --> 38:13.158
Yes, we do. It's a little different.

38:13.258 --> 38:17.270
See, with Indian people,
the head movement is side to side.

38:17.729 --> 38:21.433
Mexicans, our head
movement is front to back.

38:23.735 --> 38:28.973
The difference between that is that with
Mexicans, we have to be very, very upset

38:29.073 --> 38:31.076
in order for you to see
the head movement.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.644
Otherwise, you can't tell.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.813
With Indians, it's all the time.

that's when it comes out.

to travel to India,

You are going to see
some amazing things.

No one yells at the cows.
No one touches the cows.

They wait for the cows
to finish crossing.

The cow that we had laid down.

44:46.617 --> 44:49.229
The driver just shut off the car.

44:49.787 --> 44:51.622

"Sir, there is a cow."

"That is probably him."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

45:45.443 --> 45:47.612
Like, seriously, the driving
situation over there

45:47.712 --> 45:49.814
is so intense, you guys.

45:49.914 --> 45:51.949
One morning, one morning
while we're there,

45:52.049 --> 45:55.019
I needed to get to the airport fast,
because I overslept,

45:55.119 --> 45:56.454
and so I get in the cab,

45:56.554 --> 45:58.856
and I hand the driver a $50 bill,

45:58.956 --> 46:01.259
and I go, "Sir,
I am running very late.

46:24.882 --> 46:28.791
I notice that we're heading in
the direction of a red light.

46:30.087 --> 46:33.097
Have you ever been
in a car with someone,

46:33.291 --> 46:35.726
and you're paying attention
to what's going on,

46:35.826 --> 46:38.629
and you notice that you're
about to hit a red light?

46:38.729 --> 46:41.065
And you know how you start
to mentally and physically

46:41.165 --> 46:45.303
prepare yourself for the
deceleration of the car

46:45.403 --> 46:48.472
and you start anticipating
the pressure from the brake?

46:48.572 --> 46:50.007
And if you don't get the sensation

46:50.107 --> 46:52.310
of slowing down by a certain point,

46:52.410 --> 46:54.145
all alarms go off in your head,

46:54.245 --> 46:56.147
and you sock the driver in the chest.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.619
"Hey!"

46:59.250 --> 47:01.519
Not only did I not get the sensation

47:01.619 --> 47:04.155
of slowing down, I got the opposite.

47:04.255 --> 47:06.824
He gunned it towards the light,

47:06.924 --> 47:08.092
and it caught me off-guard.

I couldn't even scream. I was like...

And then... (MIMICS CAR PASSING)

47:19.603 --> 47:22.840
(MIMICS BRAKES SCREECHING)
He didn't even know what he did.

47:22.940 --> 47:24.075
He looks at me. He goes,

47:24.175 --> 47:25.979
(INDIAN ACCENT) "What is wrong?"

(NORMAL VOICE)

"Do you want to yell,
or do you want to make plane?"

I sounded like a third-grader.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.015
"I want to make plane."

since my last special,

I gotta tell you something
about my son Frankie.

wondering, "What is
he talking about?"

48:31.008 --> 48:32.476
And the people watching
the movie, going,

48:32.576 --> 48:34.578
"I don't get this," let me explain.

48:34.678 --> 48:37.682
In my last special, I made
reference to my son Frankie

48:37.782 --> 48:41.619
and how he refuses to
regularly put deodorant on.

48:41.719 --> 48:43.754
And so I told him,
"If you don't start doing it,

48:43.854 --> 48:45.923
"I'm going put your business on TV,

48:46.023 --> 48:47.925
"and your friends are going
to see me talking about you,

"and they're going to
check you for me."

Sure enough, my last special airs.

The next day, Frankie goes to school,

48:54.865 --> 48:57.409
and those kids were merciless.

48:58.102 --> 49:00.638
He came home.
He takes off his backpack.

49:00.738 --> 49:02.640
He unzips it, and he dumps out,

49:02.740 --> 49:04.775
like, 17 deodorants.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.986
"See what you did!"

I was like, "Wow, look at all
the money we just saved."

49:13.717 --> 49:15.453
His mom was impressed.

49:15.553 --> 49:18.757
She was like, "Talk about
how he needs towels."

49:19.824 --> 49:22.664
Hell, yeah. He's going to get towels.

49:24.161 --> 49:25.463

49:25.563 --> 49:27.398
you know, for me to relate to my son,

49:27.498 --> 49:29.467
it's a little challenging, you guys.

49:29.567 --> 49:32.136
It's not that I can't relate
to a teenager, because I can.

49:32.236 --> 49:33.671
I can relate to almost any age.

doesn't see me as an entertainer.

He sees me as the guy that
tells him to take a shower,

put on deodorant, you know,

50:41.572 --> 50:43.941
The thing is, is that our
worlds are very different.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.810
His world revolves around

Grand Theft Auto, the video game,

50:48.579 --> 50:50.850
YouTube and girls.

50:51.015 --> 50:53.354
He's really good at two of those.

50:54.485 --> 50:56.858
The other one, not so much.

50:57.321 --> 50:59.089
And it's not that I'm trying
to be a hater about it.

50:59.189 --> 51:00.458
It's just that I tell Frankie,

51:00.558 --> 51:03.561
"Listen, you need to start
having more conversations.

"You need to become more
talkative and interact like this."

That's his whole thing. I'm like,

do it professionally."

"Frankie, did you
take out the trash?"

51:47.738 --> 51:48.939
He's 16 years old now.

51:49.039 --> 51:50.174
He should have been doing
this since he was 10,

51:50.274 --> 51:51.842
but, you know,
better late than never.

51:51.942 --> 51:54.278
And what he does is he'll
sit in the living room,

51:54.378 --> 51:56.847
and he tunes out the
rest of the house.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.116
He sits there, and he'll
put on these headphones

52:07.891 --> 52:10.294
that when he starts watching
his YouTube videos,

52:10.394 --> 52:12.830
he can't hear himself laugh.

52:12.930 --> 52:16.000
And for me, that is the
funniest thing in the world.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.202
I'm in the other room,
and I can hear him.

52:18.302 --> 52:20.137
This is what I hear...

(GROANING)

52:29.947 --> 52:31.353
(SCREAMING)

52:32.850 --> 52:36.520
I'm in the other room, like,
"Who brought the Germans?"

52:39.757 --> 52:41.992
And so I walk out into the
living room, and I see Frankie,

52:42.092 --> 52:43.494
and he's laughing at his phone,

52:43.594 --> 52:45.396
and I got to flag him down.
"Hey, hey, hey."

52:45.496 --> 52:47.831
And he'll take 'em off.
"What? What's up, Dad?"

52:47.931 --> 52:50.267
I go, "Frankie,
can you do me a favor?

52:50.367 --> 52:53.846
"Can you please take out the trash?"
"Okay." And then he puts 'em back on.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.477
"What?

52:59.843 --> 53:01.345
"Now?"

"when you ask for a ride, not later."

Then he says, "Where are we going?"

53:11.789 --> 53:13.691
"Just take out the trash."

53:13.791 --> 53:15.626
And then he does it.
He takes out the trash,

53:15.726 --> 53:18.862
but he acts like he's doing me
the biggest favor in the world,

53:18.962 --> 53:21.632
and he stares me down,
and he doesn't break eye contact,

53:21.732 --> 53:23.377
He's like... (SIGHING)

53:28.839 --> 53:31.713
And then he'll hold the bag over
the can, and he makes the sound...

53:32.009 --> 53:33.449
(LOUD SIGH)

53:33.877 --> 53:35.852
I'm like, "Dude, so much drama."

53:37.214 --> 53:39.783
It's crazy. I'd like to have
normal conversations with him,

53:39.883 --> 53:42.453
but usually I gotta take it
that far for us to interact.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.088
You know? I look forward
to conversations.

53:44.188 --> 53:45.889
Even if it's something
small and minute,

53:45.989 --> 53:49.760
at least it gives me a chance to
trigger another conversation with him.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.462
I look forward to a few things.

53:51.562 --> 53:52.730
I look forward to December,

53:52.830 --> 53:55.099
because in December,
Frankie becomes very chatty.

Otherwise, he's "One-word Kid."

about, kids, "One-word Kid"?

"You have any homework?" "Yeah."
"Are you going to do it?" "Maybe."

54:04.675 --> 54:05.743
"You hungry?" "Mmm-hmm"

"What do you want?" "Food."

Usually that's what I get.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.787
But December rolls around,
and guess what December is.

54:16.887 --> 54:18.756
December's when he
becomes very chatty,

54:18.856 --> 54:20.090
because he has an agenda.

54:20.190 --> 54:22.426
All of a sudden, he goes from
"One-word Kid" to very, like,

54:22.526 --> 54:24.495
"Hey, how's your week, Dad?
You doing good?

54:24.595 --> 54:26.530
"Yeah, how are the shows going?
You doing all right?

"Do you need anything?
You need anything?"

54:28.265 --> 54:30.911
I'm like, "I needed this in July.
Just saying."

54:32.069 --> 54:34.805
And I know it's fake,
but at least, once again,

54:34.905 --> 54:38.208
it allows me to put my real
conversation on top of his fake one.

54:38.308 --> 54:40.351
And if that's what it takes,
then that's what it takes.

54:40.711 --> 54:44.114
In addition to that,
I look forward to problems.

54:44.214 --> 54:47.317
I like problems,
because if there's problems,

54:47.417 --> 54:50.387
Frankie and I can work on it
together to find a solution, right?

54:50.487 --> 54:53.258
And I see that as a
great form of bonding.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.025
Now don't get me wrong, you guys.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.271
Sometimes it's expensive.

54:58.495 --> 55:01.369
Yeah, you're laughing.
Let me tell you.

55:01.565 --> 55:03.901
Like, one time, they took
his iPhone from school,

55:04.001 --> 55:06.136
and he comes home,
and he's all devastated, right?

55:06.236 --> 55:08.472
He's like, "Dad, Dad,
I got to talk to you."

55:08.572 --> 55:09.973
I'm like, "What? Tell me. What?"

55:10.073 --> 55:11.375
(SOBBING) "They stole my phone."

55:11.475 --> 55:13.450
I'm like, "That's why
you're talking."

55:14.912 --> 55:16.647
And I started laughing.
He goes, "It's not funny."

55:16.747 --> 55:19.518
I go, "You have no
idea how funny it is."

55:20.083 --> 55:21.518
I go, "So what happened, Frankie?

55:21.618 --> 55:23.654
"So they broke into my locker at school,
and they took my iPhone,

55:23.754 --> 55:24.688
"they took my friend's iPhone,

55:24.788 --> 55:26.724
"and if we go to the school right now,
we can fill out a report.

55:26.824 --> 55:28.759
"We know exactly who did it.
Can we go to the school right now?"

55:28.859 --> 55:30.661
I go, "Listen, Frankie, I'd love to,

55:30.761 --> 55:32.429
"but I'm really tired.
I just got off a flight

55:32.529 --> 55:34.665
"and, you know,
I'm really, really tired.

55:34.765 --> 55:36.233
"I promise you tomorrow morning,
I'll take you early.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.335
"I'll help you fill out the
report and we'll turn it in."

55:38.435 --> 55:42.549
"Could we go right now?" I go, "Frankie,
seriously. Just please, tomorrow."

55:42.706 --> 55:44.608
(GROANS) "I need my phone."
I go, "Listen, Frankie,

55:44.708 --> 55:46.677
"you can handle one day
without your phone."

55:46.777 --> 55:49.613
He's not getting his way,
so he turns around,

55:49.713 --> 55:52.216
and he yells at
the ground, and he goes,

55:52.316 --> 55:54.052
"They took my phone!"

55:55.385 --> 55:57.521
I looked at him. I say,
"Hey, you took my freedom.

55:57.621 --> 55:59.266
"You don't hear me screaming."

56:00.224 --> 56:02.025
"I just accept it and process it,

56:02.125 --> 56:03.998
"and we move on. That's it."

56:05.462 --> 56:07.898
So then he asks,
"What's going to happen?"

56:07.998 --> 56:10.300
I go, "Well, I'm gonna go upstairs,
take a shower, and probably go to bed."

56:10.400 --> 56:12.936
"No, what's gonna happen if
I don't get my phone back?"

56:13.036 --> 56:15.072
I go, "That's a good question,
Frankie. I don't know."

56:15.172 --> 56:17.107
"You're not going to
get me a new one?"

56:17.207 --> 56:18.976
"No, dude. I already got you a phone.

56:19.076 --> 56:21.812
"It was your responsibility
to take care of that phone."

56:21.912 --> 56:24.815
"It's not fair." I go,
"Life's not fair, Frankie, okay?

56:24.915 --> 56:26.049
"But things happen."

56:26.149 --> 56:28.886
"You should get me a phone."
"Dude, seriously?"

56:28.986 --> 56:31.889
And then he looks at me, and he says,
and this kind of messed with me.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.724
He goes, "You should get me a phone.

56:33.824 --> 56:36.300
"It's nothing for you
to get me a new phone."

56:39.229 --> 56:43.468
"It's nothing for you
to get me a new phone."

56:43.834 --> 56:47.838
Bay Area, my son thinks
that what I do is easy.

56:47.938 --> 56:49.807
He thinks it's easy,
because all he sees

56:49.907 --> 56:51.675
when he attends one
or two shows per year

56:51.775 --> 56:54.978
is that I walk out onstage,
you guys start chanting,

56:55.078 --> 56:57.758
and then cool shit magically
appears in his room.

56:57.881 --> 56:59.253
(ALL LAUGHING)

57:01.885 --> 57:04.421
He doesn't realize that
this is actually a job

57:04.521 --> 57:06.256
and there's sacrifice
that comes along with it.

57:06.356 --> 57:09.259
So I told him. I said, "Listen,
Frankie, how 'bout this?

57:09.359 --> 57:14.198
"How 'bout you explain to me why
I should get you a new phone,

57:14.298 --> 57:17.741
"and if it makes sense,
I'll do it right now. Go."

57:18.035 --> 57:19.737
"I need one."

57:20.604 --> 57:23.874
I said, "No, Frankie. You're a teenager.
You don't need a phone.

57:23.974 --> 57:26.710
"A cell phone for a
teenager isn't a necessity.

57:26.810 --> 57:29.179
"It's a luxury, okay?

57:29.279 --> 57:33.325
"It's not a necessity,
it's a luxury."

57:33.717 --> 57:35.294
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

57:39.923 --> 57:42.793
He says, "What if
there's an emergency?"

57:42.893 --> 57:45.796
I go, "Like what?
Someone taking your phone?

57:45.896 --> 57:47.664
"What did you do today when
they took your phone?"

57:47.764 --> 57:51.001
"I went to the...
I went to the cafeteria,

57:51.101 --> 57:52.302
"and I talked to my friend Angel

57:52.402 --> 57:54.338
"and he let me use his phone,
and I called my mom."

57:54.438 --> 57:55.839
And I go, "And guess what?
If that doesn't work,

57:55.939 --> 57:57.474
"you can go to the office
and let them know,

57:57.574 --> 58:01.347
"'There's a family emergency,
please contact my mom or my dad.' Next."

58:01.578 --> 58:03.180
"What if you need to
get a hold of me?"

58:03.280 --> 58:05.824
"I know what school you go to."

58:06.116 --> 58:07.751
"What about when I'm walking home?"

58:07.851 --> 58:09.887
"I know the route that you take."

58:09.987 --> 58:12.823
And then he pulled this one out,
one of the greatest lines ever.

58:12.923 --> 58:16.570
"You know what?
You talk a lot about me on TV.

58:16.860 --> 58:19.131
"People know who I am now.

58:21.264 --> 58:23.637
"What if someone tries to kidnap me?"

58:26.303 --> 58:29.143
I said, "You weigh 225. Good luck.

58:31.641 --> 58:33.110
"They are not kidnapping your ass

58:33.210 --> 58:34.878
"without an iPhone
and a box of Oreos.

58:34.978 --> 58:38.048
"That's the only way
that's going to happen."

58:38.148 --> 58:40.250
I said, "Frankie, do you
realize how lucky you are?

58:40.350 --> 58:43.053
"You had a phone. I didn't
have a phone in school.

58:43.153 --> 58:44.755
"Your mom didn't have
a phone in school.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.223
"If we needed to make a phone call,

58:46.323 --> 58:49.626
"we had to carry change,
or we had to call collect."

58:49.726 --> 58:51.997
"What's that?" Oh, my God!

58:52.796 --> 58:56.033
Trying to explain the concept
of a collect call to my kid

58:56.133 --> 58:58.201
is like trying to
explain rocket science.

58:58.301 --> 58:59.870
He'll never have to deal with it.

58:59.970 --> 59:01.805
He'll never know what it's
like to be out late somewhere

59:01.905 --> 59:03.106
and have to use a phone.

59:03.206 --> 59:06.209
First of all, to find a pay phone.

59:06.309 --> 59:08.445
If you see a pay phone now,
you look at it like,

59:08.545 --> 59:10.714
"Oh, wow.
They forgot to take it down.

59:10.814 --> 59:12.816
"Get your camera. Take a picture.

59:12.916 --> 59:15.786
"Cause that shit's gone.
Take a picture."

59:15.886 --> 59:17.721
He'll never know about
staying out late at night

59:17.821 --> 59:19.589
and having to use one
of those nasty phones

59:19.689 --> 59:20.924
and taking off that receiver.

59:21.024 --> 59:22.559
You know, the nasty one that has gum

59:22.659 --> 59:24.161
and gonorrhea all over it, right?

59:24.261 --> 59:25.762
And you got to keep it
far away from your face,

59:25.862 --> 59:27.264
so you don't get infected.

59:27.364 --> 59:29.566
And then you make that phone call,
you know, that freaking...

59:29.666 --> 59:31.668
When you make a collect
call back in the day?

59:31.768 --> 59:34.404
It was expensive. He's not
going to have to do that now.

59:34.504 --> 59:37.441
Back in the day, if you made a
collect call, it was a mission.

59:37.541 --> 59:39.509
It was a mission,
and it was expensive.

59:39.609 --> 59:41.278
If you called my mom collect,

59:41.378 --> 59:43.148
it better have been life or death

59:43.680 --> 59:45.723
or that's what it was going to be.

59:46.249 --> 59:47.951
You call my mom back
in the day, shoot,

59:48.051 --> 59:50.120
we were on welfare and Section 8.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.955
Every penny counted.

And if you couldn't get
the whole message out,

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:33.463
you had to call back, do that
whole process all over again,

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:36.400
and then say another sentence
until they cut you off.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.112
I told Frankie we call
that "ghetto texting."

'Cause he'll never have to do it.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:46.243
The problem is, is that
my son is very spoiled,

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:49.679
and I realize that it's my fault.
It's 100% my fault.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:50.914
When he first came into my life,

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:53.683
when he was seven years old,
he was very appreciative.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.919
Everything was, "Thank you."
Everything was like, "Oh, my God.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.487
"This is so cool. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you."

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:00.961
Big old hug. "Thank you.
I love you. Thank you."

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:05.662
And what I did was, is that
I started giving him stuff,

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.330
and I never expected anything for it,

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.666
and, you know, with me,
I was always like, you know,

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.602
I work really hard
to have nice things,

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:15.005
and is it a crime that I want
my family to have nice things?

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.606
I figure, you know what?
I went through a lot.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.542
I just want my son to have the best.

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:20.277
But you can't always
give 'em everything,

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:23.346
because then they don't learn
to appreciate and value things,

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:26.149

the hard way. Eh?

you guys that, by the way,

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:37.094
that I freaking messed up.
My girl pointed it out.

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.129
She goes, "You're messing up."

I go, "What am I doing wrong?"

She goes, "You don't let him earn
anything. You don't let him try.

Not just a regular pair of Jordans.

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:02.219
They were a special collector's
edition pair of Jordans.

You know, the kind of Jordans where
people wait in line the night before

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:06.756
just so they can buy these shoes.

'cause I got the hookup!

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.370
Yeah.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:16.099
They were really nice shoes,
$180 pair of shoes, and...

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.401
Yeah. Hey, lot of jokes. So...

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:20.570
I didn't even wrap 'em, okay?

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.740
I put 'em on the box, and I waited
for him to walk in the room.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.342
And I'm standing there,
and he walks in.

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:28.445
I go, "Happy birthday,"
and he sees the shoes.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:31.481
He looks at the shoes,
and all he says is,

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.251
"Cool." That's it. "Cool."

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.019
Sometimes I'll get lucky,
he'll say it twice.

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.730
"Cool, cool."

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:40.657
And then he walks around to see
what other presents there are,

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.260
and I told his mom,
"Did you see that? Did you see..."

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.463
"Don't get mad. I told you,
you don't let him earn anything.

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:49.573
"Now that's why he acts that way.
He expects things."

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.608
I'm like, "Oh."

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.337
And I want to get upset,
but she's absolutely right.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.439
He's at the point now of spoiled

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.108
where he walks up to me, and he goes,

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.810
"Dad, I'm really bored
with my Nintendo Wii.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.445
"Can I give it to my friend Angel?"

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.681
I go, "What did you just say?"

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.184

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.490
"Why are you pointing?"

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.959
"'Cause you're fat,
your fat's going everywhere.

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:04.794
"Your fat's going everywhere."

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:07.830
I go, "Really? My fat's going
everywhere? Well, guess what?

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:11.009
"This fat makes your mom horny."

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.079
(ALL CHEERING)

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:15.079
(MOUTHING)

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:25.458
And he's like... (SCREAMING)

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:32.098
If I ask him to do something,
and he doesn't do it,

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.557
like, for example, as parents,

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:37.326
you want your kids to go
to sleep by a certain time,

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.463
because you need 'em to wake up
in time to get ready for school.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:42.865
Frankie's cutoff is 11:00.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:45.668
It's pretty late,
if you ask me, for a kid.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:48.237
Sometimes he'll push it to midnight,
you know, play dumb.

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.472
"Oh, I didn't know what time it was."

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:52.275
"Yeah, whatever.
You're only holding a clock."

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.678
But I get it. I used
to play dumb, too.

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:58.147
So then he'll walk in his room,
and he'll say...

01:11:58.247 --> 01:12:00.516
(YAWNING) "Good night, Dad,"
and he'll close the door.

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:01.651
(MIMICS DOOR CLOSING)

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.186
And he thinks he's slick.

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:06.255
He takes a towel, and he
starts rolling up the towel,

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:08.157
and he puts it under the door,

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:11.301
so that I can't see the
light coming from the TV.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.162
Sounds pretty genius, right?

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.466
But, hello, cover the
rest of the stupid door.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.569
He freaking turns on his big-ass TV,

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:22.645
and it looks like Immigration's
breaking in to his bedroom.

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.509
And so what happens is he'll stay up

01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:28.511
until 2:00, 3:00,
4:00 in the morning,

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:31.180
and he, you know,
he's supposed to wake up at 6:00.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.183
His alarm goes off, and he
sleeps through the alarm,

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:36.018
and it's a real alarm-alarm.

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.054
It's not a radio. It's freaking...

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:40.223
(MIMICS ALARM BLARING)

01:12:40.323 --> 01:12:42.161
Whole house awake. Him?

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.834
(SNORING)

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:45.695
And it's right here.

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.864
So I got to get out of bed,
and I go over to his room,

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:51.033
and I open the door, and I kick
the stupid towel out of the way,

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:52.969
and then I walk over, you know.

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:54.203
(MIMICS ALARM BLARING)

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:55.371
(MIMICS TURNING OFF ALARM)

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:57.344
(PANTING)

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.718
And I yell, "Frankie! Frankie!"

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:02.712
Nothing, so I shake him.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:04.380
"Frankie, wake up."

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.116
You know what happens when
I shake my son in the morning?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.692
It makes him eat in his sleep.

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:13.196
That's what happens.
I shake him, and he does this.

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:24.467
So you know what I do?

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:28.237
I get on top of the bed,
and I slowly lay on top of him,

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:31.507
and I apply my full weight,
bro, all of it,

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.787
slowly, and you could hear him.

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:35.920
(GROANING)

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:42.893
"Oh, God! Oh, God!
You're too big! You're too big!"

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.821
And then I whisper in his ear,

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.226
(WHISPERS)
"That's what your mom said."

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.093
(ALL CHEERING)

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:04.575
I know one day, my son is going to write
a book called Fluffy's Full of Shit.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.316
It's kind of crazy.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.380
I talked to his mom.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.617
I talked to Frankie's mom,
and she tells me, "Listen."

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:17.620
She goes, "I'm going to tell
you something. Don't get mad.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.129
"The reason why you and Frankie
are always butting heads

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:24.768
"is because you guys are
basically the same person."

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.963
And I go, "We are not
the same person."

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.664
She goes,
"Your mannerisms are the same.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:29.966
"The way you guys think is the same.

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:32.668
"You're exactly...
You're moody in the same way.

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:33.803
"It's the same."

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.005
And keep in mind,
Frankie's technically my stepson,

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:37.807
so my girl insisting this,
that we're the same,

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.644
I'm like, "Hello, I wasn't
there at the beginning."

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.981
But, no, she insists.
"You guys are the same."

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:46.649
And I started analyzing our lives.

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.251
I started analyzing Frankie's life,

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:49.819
and I started analyzing my life,

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:51.487
and I started realizing that,
you know what,

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.657
our lives run on these
crazy parallels.

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:56.425
I'm going to tell you guys something.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.161
In all my previous specials,
I'd always talk about my mom.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.230
My mom, my mom, my mom, my mom.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.666
I never really made
references about my dad,

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:06.202
because my dad wasn't there
when I was growing up.

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:07.703
And I made a joke one time

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:10.039
about how my mom said that
my dad was a mariachi.

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:11.841
Which is true,
and that he was the guy

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.984
that was on the bottle of hot sauce.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.548
My dad was the Tapatío guy.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.850
So after that,

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.753
people started asking
questions about my dad,

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.755
and so they're like, "So what's
the story with your dad?"

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.690
And it felt really awkward
for me to bring up the fact

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:29.358
that I didn't grow up
with one, you know?

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:31.527
And nobody wants to tell people,
"I grew up without a parent."

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:34.297
For me, it was very personal,
and I started building up this wall,

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:37.733
because people kept asking questions,
especially this one,

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:41.537
"What would you say if your
dad wanted to see you now?"

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:44.106
And for me, it's been over 30 years,

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.608
and so I'd always say the same thing.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.576
I said, "Well, if my
dad wanted to see me,

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.856
"I'd tell him he has
to buy a ticket."

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.214
That was the go-to line.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.617
"If my dad wants to see me,
I'll tell him to buy a ticket.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.191
"I'll tell him to buy a ticket.

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.920
"My dad wants to see
me 30 years later,

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.230
"I'm going to have him buy a ticket."
I said this for over seven years.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.369
And guess who bought a ticket?

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:04.593
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.964
Bay Area, it's about to get real.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:09.732
Oh, let me tell you this one.

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:13.169
So I'm doing a show at
a comedy club in LA

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.837
called the Comedy & Magic Club,

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.306
and it's about a 250-seat room,

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.076
and the manager Richard comes
up to me before I go onstage,

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:21.477
and he goes, "Hey, listen, Gabe.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.480
"Your dad's in the back of the room.
"Can we pay for his drinks and his food?"

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.615
I go, "What are you talking about?"
He goes, "Yeah, your dad's in the back.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:27.917
"Are we paying for
his food and drinks?"

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:30.186
I go, "Listen, I haven't seen
my dad in over 30 years.

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:32.088
"That's somebody trying to
get free food and drinks.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.622
"Cut him off.
Don't pay for anything."

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.591
"Got it, bro." So I go up onstage.

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:38.963
I start doing my thing.
No problem, show goes over very well.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.131
I wind up outside after the show,
and I'm doing a meet-and-greet.

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:44.266
I'm taking pictures,
and I'm signing DVDs.

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.535
My dad goes out and gets in line

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:49.305
with the rest of the fans
to try to meet me like that.

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:51.807
And my manager goes
to the back of the line,

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.542
and then she comes up
to me, and she goes,

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.611
"Listen, Gabe. Um...

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.313
"The guy that's at the
back of the line,

01:16:57.413 --> 01:17:01.017
"I have a feeling that
that could be your dad."

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.661
I go, "Really? You, too? Why?"

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:09.431
"I saw his ID. Gabe,
is his name Jesus?"

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:14.103
And I was like, "Well, that's a one-in-four
chance right there, you know?"

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:17.400
I mean, seriously,
you can't throw a rock

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.644
in Los Angeles without hitting
a Jesus. You really can't.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:25.408
And so I go, "That's it?"

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:29.211
She goes, "Gabe, I'm going to be
honest with you. He has your eyes."

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.014
I go, "Really? Out of all of this,

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:35.317
"you went to the two smallest things
on my body to compare us two?

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.219
"Are you kidding me?"

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:41.490
And then she said, "Is his
birthday December 25th?"

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:45.561
And my heart dropped, because my
dad's birthday is actually Christmas.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:46.929
Every year, my mom would remind me,

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:50.366
"Merry Christmas. He's not
here again. Open your gift."

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:52.034
And so it always stuck right here,

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:54.537
"December 25th, December 25th,
December 25th."

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:58.841
So it freaked me out so bad that I
started shaking. I started shaking.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.143
I was freaking out, because it was
a bunch of emotions. I was angry.

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:04.113
I was sad. I was happy. It was just
everything all at the same time.

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:06.415
And so people are coming up to me.
They're like, "Are you okay?"

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.017
And I kept saying this over and over.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.920
I said, "My dad's here. My dad's here.
My dad's here. My dad's here."

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.055
And they're like, "That's good.
Your dad's here to support you."

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.690
I'm like, "I haven't seen
him in over 30 years."

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.436
And they're like, "Awkward.
Yeah. Awkward."

01:18:18.661 --> 01:18:21.030
So I told my manager, "Go to the
back of the line and get him out.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.199
"This is not the time or the
place to do this, right?"

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:25.301
So she goes back there,
and I see them talking.

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:27.703
Then I see him walking away,
and then he stops,

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:31.040
and he turns around, and he
looks at me, and he waves.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.944
And it freaked me out, you guys.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:36.879
In addition to freaking me out,
he's holding one of my DVDs,

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:40.716
which really messed me up,
because I've been signing DVDs all night.

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.393
What was I going to put on his?

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:46.029
You know? "Hey, where you been?"

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.395
So she gets his info, gives it to me.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:56.332
I give the info to my girlfriend,
right, and I finish the meet-and-greet.

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:58.000
We get in the car. We go back home.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.902
I'm not saying anything.
I'm just shaking.

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:01.837
I'm sweating, and my
girl goes, "You okay?"

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:02.938
I said, "Listen, you know what?

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.908
"I been playing this scenario
in my head for over 30 years,

01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:07.409
"what would I do if
he ever showed up.

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.078
"I thought I was
prepared to handle this,

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:10.913
"and I'm not. I'm freaking out."

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:13.249
And she goes, "Baby, listen,
how 'bout we sleep on it,

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:14.950
"and we'll figure this
out together tomorrow?

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.820
"Just sleep on it. Try to relax."
And I'm like, "That's a good idea."

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.321
So we get in bed.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.857
She knocks out, and I'm just...
I can't. I can't sleep.

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:25.361
And 3:00 in the morning rolls around,
and I say, "I can't take it anymore."

01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:27.129
So I wake up my girl.
I said, "Baby, get up."

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:30.103
"What is it? What?"
I go, "Listen, call him."

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:32.601
"Right now?" I go, "Yes."

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:36.610
"It's 3:00 in the morning.
That's disrespectful."

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:40.348
I'm like, "Hello.
Who waited 30 years?"

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:44.980
"Fine." So she gets on the
phone, and she calls my dad,

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.849
and he answered on the first ring,

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.518
and I could hear 'em talking,
going back and forth.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.053
And then she hangs up
the phone, and she says,

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:54.023
"Listen, baby, your dad
wants me to let you know

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.859
"that he doesn't want any money.
He doesn't want any money.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.296
"He doesn't want anything from you,
but 10 minutes of your time,

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:02.231
"so he can ask you a
couple of questions

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.466
"and hopefully answer some questions.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:08.976
"Me, personally, I think you need closure,
because you're messed up."

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:14.018
My girl keeps it real.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:17.290
So I said, "Listen, call him back.

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:18.881
"Let him know that I
want to see him today

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.182
"at the comedy club where we met."

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.184
She goes, "Fine."
So she calls him back.

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:25.487
She hangs up the phone. And she goes,
"Okay, baby, I confirmed it.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:28.691
"7:00 at the comedy club.
Can we get some sleep now?"

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.659
And I go, "Listen,
I got to do something."

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:34.863
She goes, "What?" And I get out of bed,
and I walk over to the living room.

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:37.666
And in the living room,
I have a giant mirror, okay?

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.835
And this giant mirror,
I get in front of it,

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:43.105
and I start rehearsing the speech
I'm about to have with my dad

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:46.508
that I haven't seen in over 30 years.
Now keep in mind, you guys.

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:51.347
This is the only thing I've ever really
rehearsed. I can't rehearse this,

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:55.017
because I don't know if it's funny
or not until you laugh at it.

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:56.852
Seriously. I can stand in
front of the mirror all day.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:59.188
(BABBLES)
(LAUGHS)

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:00.694
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.592
Apparently that shit is funny.
Okay, cool.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.872
I'll try it again tomorrow.

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.530
So I'm front of the mirror.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.867
I'm very emotional, and my
whole chest is bright red,

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:14.536
because I'm doing the stupid,
emotional macho thing.

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:17.039
I'm standing there,
and I'm doing this...

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:19.376
"Who do you think you are?

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:22.144
"Who do you think you are?"

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.812
And my girlfriend grabs me.
She grabs me.

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:26.115
"Baby, calm down,"
and I snapped on her.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:29.318
I said, "Listen, this is the only way
I know how to handle this, okay?

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:30.552
"Just give me a little bit of space.

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.288
"I promise you tomorrow
I'll be a better person.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:34.657
"This is the only way I
know how to deal with this.

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:38.093
"Please understand." And she
was like, "I get it, No worries.

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:41.797
"I'm in the room if you need me."
And so she goes in the room,

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.500
and I keep freaking yelling
and emotional, screaming.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.336
And later on, she told me that I
guess I was being really loud

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:50.172
with the screaming and the hitting,
and I woke up Frankie.

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.940
And she says that Frankie
came in the living room,

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:56.145
and he hears freaking yelling and
hits and pops, and so he got scared,

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.914
and he sees me standing there in front
of the mirror, and I'm hitting myself,

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:02.285
and he freaked out. He was like...
"I better take out the trash."

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:04.061
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:13.028
Now don't get me wrong.
It's hysterical now, but at that moment,

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:14.430
I didn't notice it,
and I didn't care.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.598
My focus is, "What am I
gonna say to this man?"

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:21.637
So I'm freaking nailing myself,
and finally, okay, 6:45 rolls around.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:24.873
My girl and I get in the car,
and we head over to the comedy club.

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.942
We get there about 15 minutes late,
and you know what?

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.711
I'm like, "That's cool.
I'm glad we're late.

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:30.612
"This way, I'll just
walk into the club,

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.348
"I'll look at him,
and I'll start talking."

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.783
We pull up to the front.
(MIMICS BRAKES SCREECHING)

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:38.687
I get out of the car. I start
walking up towards the sidewalk.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:43.127
My dad is also 15 minutes late,
and he's walking up the curb,

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.828
It caught me off-guard,

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:47.896
because I wasn't planning on
meeting him on the street.

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:50.299
I was gonna meet him inside.
So now I froze.

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:51.839
I'm like... (GROANS)

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:55.607
He looks at me,
and he does this. He goes...

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:01.977
And for me, I'm like,
"You know what? No.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.913
"You can't do this. You can't show up
after 30 years and expect to hug me."

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:08.484
In my head, I'm like, "Do I
hug him, or do I hit him?"

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:11.053
And if my girl wouldn't have been
there, I'd have laid his ass out.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:14.323
You don't do that to a kid.
And seriously, you guys. You can't.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.625
- You can't just show up...
- (AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:26.502
And so my girl's looking at me, and she
sees the situation from different eyes,

01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:29.338
so she's like, "You know what?
Just..." And I'm like... (GROANS)

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:32.274
So I walk over to him,
and I put my arms around him,

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:33.375
and I'll be honest with you guys.

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:36.612
It was the emptiest hug
I have ever given anyone,

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:38.914
and I'm hugging him,
and he starts crying in my ear.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.116
And when he starts crying in
my ear, I pushed him off.

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.352
And I go, "No,
don't even try that. No."

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:45.721
And he's like, "No, no, no.
No, no. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry."

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:48.457
And I go, "Turn around.
Go inside." And he's, "Okay, okay."

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:50.592
So he turns around, and he goes
inside, and I start shaking.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.861
And my girl's like, "You okay?"
I go, "I'm freaking out right now."

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.363
She goes, "Baby, just breathe."
I'm like... (EXHALES)

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:57.099
I'm trying to breathe and relax,
and he walks in.

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:00.102
Five minutes go by, and I go,
"All right. Here we go."

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:01.804
I walk inside.

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:05.574
I see him sitting down, and I
walk right up to him, and I go...

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.110
"Who do you think you are?"

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.479
And my girlfriend grabbed me.
"Baby, calm down."

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:13.453
"Hey, you saw me doing
the shit at the house."

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.089
And I started laying into my dad.
I started asking all the questions.

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.892
You know, "Why? Where were you?
What happened? Did you even try?

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:26.395
"What was going on in your
life that was so important?"

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:28.230
And what really bothered
me was the fact

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:32.234
that he had a solid answer for every
single question I hit him with,

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:34.837
because I compared 'em to notes
from my mom and my sisters.

01:24:34.937 --> 01:24:36.472
And more than anything,
I just wanted to vent.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:39.007
I wanted to yell. I wanted to cuss.
I wanted to scream.

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:41.944
I wanted to get physical, and he
wasn't giving me that opportunity.

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:45.315
So I started making stuff up.
I was like, "You know what, Dad?

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:46.748
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:49.221
"My mom was mean to
me because of you."

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.788
He goes, "Well,
you know something, mijo,

01:24:52.888 --> 01:24:57.092
"your mother had to do whatever
she had to do to raise you right.

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.528
"Look how good you turned out."

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:02.001
I was like, "Oh, he's good."

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.476
Apparently he has a mirror, too.

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:10.939
So I kept hitting him
with more questions,

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.108
and he kept coming back
with solid answers.

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:14.376
Eventually I got to the point

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:17.546
where I started asking the same
questions over and over again,

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:19.615
to see if maybe I'd get
a different answer,

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:22.784
and it started becoming redundant,
and I'm just going in circles.

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:26.455
Next thing I know,
my dad starts cracking jokes.

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:29.825
I'm like, "Seriously? 30 years,
and now you're cracking jokes?"

01:25:29.925 --> 01:25:33.529
And it's not so much that he was
cracking jokes that bothered me.

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:36.002
It's the fact that they were funny.

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:41.643
I mean, really funny.
My girl's laughing.

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:45.614
Yeah, I could hear her.
(SNORTING) "Really?"

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:50.579
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
"What? What? I see where you get it."

01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:53.723
I'm like, "Cabrona,
you're gonna get it."

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.723
"Yeah."

01:25:57.653 --> 01:25:59.688
So the conversation is not
going anywhere. So I said,

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:01.156
"You know what? Let me
just change the subject.

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:03.559
"Let me just try to talk to
this guy as a regular person,

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.060
"not try to meet him as my dad."

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.496
So next thing I know, we got on
the subject of entertainment,

01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:08.931
and that's something that
we both clicked with,

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:11.433
because my dad was a
mariachi for 20 years,

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.834
and of course I do what I do,

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:15.337
but the stories and the
lifestyle is very similar.

01:26:15.437 --> 01:26:17.473
You know, we shared a lot of stories
about being at train stations,

01:26:17.574 --> 01:26:19.408
bus stations, the airports,
being in the shuttle vans,

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:21.843
being in this city, that city,
this country, that country,

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:23.412
coming home to a family
that missed you,

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:27.015
or coming home to a family that
only wanted to see the check.

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:30.659
Next thing I know, we started
laughing. He high-fived me.

01:26:30.786 --> 01:26:33.689
And then I told him, I says, "You know
what? I got to be honest with you."

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:36.525
I said, "I tried. I tried to
hate you. I really did."

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:40.228
I go, "But I understand.
I understand what happened.

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:43.265
"And I just want to let you know that
I'm very grateful that you're here,

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:47.202
"and I'm sorry that I was
the way that I was, um..."

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:48.637
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.041
Yeah.

01:26:57.813 --> 01:26:59.448
I says, "I think I
really needed this."

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.483
And he goes, "I know I
needed this." I go, "Yeah."

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.785
I go, "Listen, I want to
ask you for a favor."

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.555
"Anything. Tu dime.
Whatever. Tu dime."

01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:10.058
I go, "Look, I don't have
any pictures of you,

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.860
"of my mom, and myself together.

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.895
"It would mean a lot to me
if I could get a picture

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:16.398
"with the three of us together,
so that I could blow it up and frame it

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:18.400
"and put it on my wall.
Would you be willing

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.068
"to take a picture with
my mom and myself?"

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:24.406
"No problem. You name it.
Yo lo hago. No problem."

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:26.008
I go, "Okay, thank you.
I appreciate that."

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:29.447
I go, "I just gotta check with my mom."
And he goes... (EXCLAIMS)

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:34.218
And I was like, "Right?" (LAUGHING)

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.488
So I gave him a real hug.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:43.091
I got his direct info, and, you know,
he told me he was going back to Mexico

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:45.260
for eight months and he
was gonna come back,

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.628
and he told me I had two sisters

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:49.331
that I didn't know about,
and I couldn't take it.

01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:51.800
My girl and I, we get in the car,
and we go to my mom's house.

(MIMICS CAR PASSING)

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:55.504
We get to the front,
and my mom hears the car,

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:58.206
so she comes outside, and she's like...
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.374
"What are you doing here?"

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:03.417
I go, "Mom, you are not gonna
believe who I just had dinner with."

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:05.287
"Obama."

"bigger than Obama,

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:14.056
I say, "Let's go inside the house.

01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:15.957
"This is a good one,

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:21.396
So she goes inside. I follow her,
my girl's behind me.

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:24.700
Close the door. I go, "Mom, listen."
I says, "I need you to sit down,

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.401
"because what I got to
tell you is a big deal."

dinner with? Who? Who?"

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:48.323

being like an octopus.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.328
And I'm trying to grab her,
and I'm looking at my girl.

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:57.374
"Baby, help me." She's like,
"That's your mom. This is you."

01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:01.269
I finally get my mom to
sit down, and she's...

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.506

"Who looks better?"

I said, "Listen, Mom,

but it's a hard one, okay?

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.818
"I don't have any pictures of you,
my dad, and me together."

"take a picture with the

"Why?"

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:13.001
"Mom, so that when people
come over to the house,

"I can point and go, 'Look.
Those are my parents.'

"I've never been able to do that.

"Just one picture."

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.584
So I says, "Would you
please entertain the idea

us for a few minutes,

"so that we could just
take some pictures?"

And she goes, "No, mijo,
you can't ask me to do that."

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:38.660
And we went back and forth for a while,
and she eventually agreed to it.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.829
She goes, "Okay, pero not right now.

01:31:40.929 --> 01:31:44.366
"Ahorita no, mijo. No, I have to get
ready." I'm like, "Oh, God, really?"

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:47.068
I go, "Well, Mom, here's the deal.
My dad went back to Mexico.

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:50.405
"He'll be back here in eight months.
Is that long enough?"

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.651
"I can do eight months.

"Eight months, sí, se puede.
Eight months, okay."

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.879
"All right." And I was
excited, you guys.

01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:00.348
We had a date planned out,
we had a restaurant, and I told her,

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:02.050
"Look, here's how
it's gonna work, Mom.

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:03.184
"We're gonna walk
into this restaurant.

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:05.220
"You're gonna sit on my left,
he's gonna sit on my right,

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.355
"and we're gonna take three pictures,
and then we're gonna leave,

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:10.359
"and I'm going to take
you to Golden Corral."

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:15.337
And she tells me, "Why does
he get to sit on the right?"

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.073
"You can sit on the right.
Oh, my God!"

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:23.271
So the date was set eight months later,
and unfortunately for me,

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:26.245
- my mom died before I got that opportunity.
- ALL: Aw!

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.777
The only bright side to the picture,

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:32.714
is that I got a photo
from my brother...

01:32:32.814 --> 01:32:38.053
It's a black-and-white picture, 8x10.
It's a picture of my mom and my dad

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:41.790
the night they met at a bar in
Tijuana when my dad was performing.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:44.159
It's a picture of him in his
mariachi outfit, right?

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:45.293
And he's got the microphone,

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:49.130
and my mom is sitting front row
center with a white miniskirt on.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:52.000
And she's got her hand like this,
and she's looking at my dad,

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.402
and she has this look on
her face like, (LAUGHS)

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.704
"We're going to make a Fluffy."

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.879
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:11.353
I never framed it. I keep
it at home in a drawer.

01:33:11.453 --> 01:33:13.989
It's weird for me to look at
the picture on a regular basis,

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:15.790
so I keep it in a
folder in my drawer.

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.359
Every now and then,
I'll open it, take a look at it.

01:33:17.459 --> 01:33:20.071
I'm like, "All right.
It's cool." It'll make me smile.

01:33:20.562 --> 01:33:22.831
Here's what I was
talking about earlier

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:27.102
about the whole parallels
with my son and with me.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:31.339
As this whole situation's going on,
where my dad comes back into my life,

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:36.111
Frankie's dad comes back into
his life at the exact same time.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.613
And for me, you guys,
this was way more upsetting

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.715
than the whole situation with my dad.

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:42.951
This guy e-mails me, right?
He had my e-mail address.

01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:45.120
And of course,
now he decides to use it.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.188
And I recognized the
name as soon as I saw it.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.456
And then I opened up the e-mail,

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:51.192
and right away, "I want to
thank you for raising Frankie.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:52.994
"I want to thank you for
being there for Frankie.

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:54.796
"I want to be involved
in Frankie's life.

01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:56.831
"I want to take him to sports.
I want to get involved.

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.233
"I want to be there
for him financially..."

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:00.535
And I'm getting pissed.
I'm getting piss...

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.638
I'm screaming again. I'm like, "Really?
Now you want to get involved?

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:05.473
"Now you want to be a part of this,

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:07.242
"after all the love
and time and energy

01:34:07.342 --> 01:34:10.378
"I put into a kid that wasn't even mine?
Are you shitting me?

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.954
"I just got him to
take out the trash."

01:34:16.251 --> 01:34:19.387
I started yelling at the screen more,
and my girl hears me, so she comes in.

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.488
She goes, "What's going on? Relax."

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.257
I go, "Look at the screen.
Look at the screen."

01:34:22.357 --> 01:34:26.227
"What? Relax." "Look at the screen."
"Calm down." So she starts reading.

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:28.229
And as soon as she starts
reading, she starts,

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.898
"Oh, this asshole,
now he's going to ruin every..."

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.566
And now I got to be her rock.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.312
So I stand up, and I'm like,
"No, it's okay. Shh..."

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:36.646
"But he's going to..."

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:40.008
Frankie hears his mom
getting hysterical,

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:44.946
and then he walks into the office,
and he's like, "Who died? Who died?"

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:47.549
I go, "No, Frankie, nobody died.
Get in here." "Why is my mom crying?"

01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:49.451
"I'm going to tell you why your
mom's crying. Have a seat."

01:34:49.551 --> 01:34:51.419
"I'm in trouble, huh?"
"Frankie, you're not in trouble."

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.325
"I didn't do it. "Whatever it is,
you did it. Sit down."

01:34:56.658 --> 01:34:58.026
So he sits down.

01:34:58.126 --> 01:35:00.895
I got these office chairs
with the little wheels, right?

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:02.030
And so I sit down.

01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:04.399
He sits in front of me, and I
sit his mom down next to me,

01:35:04.499 --> 01:35:06.968
and I grab his chair, and I
pull it right up to mine.

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.436
And his knees are pretty
much touching mine,

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.805
and he's right here,
and I go, "Listen, Frankie,

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:12.774
"what I got to tell you
is probably the hardest

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:15.452
"thing I've ever had
to say to you. Um...

01:35:16.244 --> 01:35:18.117
"Your dad...

01:35:18.346 --> 01:35:21.549
"Your dad, he...
Your dad wants to see you."

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:23.692
And he looks at me, and he goes...

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:26.229
"I'm right here."

01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:30.296
Oh.

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:34.367
(ALL CHEERING)

01:35:46.374 --> 01:35:49.110
I go, "Frankie, I love you so much,
but that's not what I mean.

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:52.254
"Oh, my God! Your dad-dad."

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:54.582
"Dad-dad?"

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:57.085
"Oh, my God. Um...

01:35:57.185 --> 01:35:59.126
"The man that gave you life?"

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:02.567
"Jesus?"

01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:07.401
"No! Oh, my God! That's my dad.

01:36:14.569 --> 01:36:17.372
"Your biological father,
Frankie. Your dad.

01:36:17.472 --> 01:36:21.745
"Your mom's ex-boyfriend,
your father, your dad, Randy."

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:25.847
And he went from having
this look of confusion

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.982
to, like, a straight-up
despaired look.

01:36:28.082 --> 01:36:30.185
He just looks at the ground,
and he starts mumbling.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:34.355
And as soon as he finished mumbling,
he starts telling me his memory,

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:37.792
his last memory of his dad.
And I'll be honest with you guys.

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:40.361
It's one thing to hear a
messed-up story involving a kid

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.997
seeing something he shouldn't
have seen from an adult.

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:46.201
It's another when you hear
it from the kid themselves.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:47.669
And so for me, I'm just like,
"Oh, my God!

01:36:47.769 --> 01:36:49.137
"Why am I putting him through this?"

01:36:49.237 --> 01:36:51.306
He starts telling me,
and my girl is just bawling.

01:36:51.406 --> 01:36:52.974
I'm getting choked up.
I go, "Look, Frankie,

01:36:53.074 --> 01:36:55.076
"whatever you want to do,
okay, we support it.

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.478
"If you want to see your dad,
your mom and I will make it happen.

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.480
"If you don't want to see him,
you don't have to see him,

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.050
"but you're old enough now,
and it has to come from you.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.651
"So you let us know
whenever you're ready,

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:05.753
"and we'll make it
happen either way."

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:08.990
"What do you think I should do?"
"Frankie, I wish I could tell you.

01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:10.592
"I wish I could tell you, honestly,

01:37:10.692 --> 01:37:13.428
"but you saw what I just went through."
You were yelling at the mirror."

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:16.732
"I know I was yelling
at the mirror. I know."

01:37:17.632 --> 01:37:20.268
"What did you do?" "Well, Frankie,
in my case, it was different,

01:37:20.368 --> 01:37:23.871
"because my dad waited 30 years,
and so I had to wait 30 years,

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:27.342
"and fortunately for me,
I was more mature,

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:29.611
"and I was able to handle
it a little bit better.

01:37:29.711 --> 01:37:31.512
"Plus your mom was there
to keep me in check,

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:34.182
"so I didn't do anything
stupid, but 30 years,

01:37:34.282 --> 01:37:37.552
"it actually worked out pretty good,
and now we have an actual...

01:37:37.652 --> 01:37:39.887
"We're going to go back and
forth and start talking,

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:42.056
"so 30 years worked out for me."

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:44.592
And then he looks at the ground,

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:48.062
and it felt like it took forever.
I wanted to ask him if he was okay,

01:37:48.162 --> 01:37:50.231
but I didn't want to accidentally
trigger another memory

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.367
and put him through that same
thing again, so I'm just waiting,

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:54.035
and his mom's wailing,
and we're just waiting,

01:37:54.135 --> 01:37:57.712
and then he looks at me,
and he goes, "You know what?

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:03.018
"I'm gonna wait 30 years, too."

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:08.788
Oh, my God!

01:38:10.318 --> 01:38:11.786
I got so choked up.

01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:14.088
I started crying, and then he
puts his hand on my shoulder,

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:15.823
and I started bawling.

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:18.393
And then he hugs me,
and I'm like, "Oh, my God!"

01:38:18.493 --> 01:38:19.761
And we're hugging, and I'm crying,

01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:21.929
and his mom's crying,
and then she looks at me.

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:27.335
"Now what are you gonna do?
Now what are you gonna do?"

01:38:27.435 --> 01:38:29.570
"What do you think I'm gonna do?

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:31.747
(SNIFFLING)
"I'm going to get him an iPhone."

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:33.775
(ALL CHEERING)

01:38:37.779 --> 01:38:39.720
Thank you, Bay Area.

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:43.158
I love you guys. Thank you.

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.995
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:38.894
ESTHER: Hijo, I'm home.

01:41:39.727 --> 01:41:41.262
Did you give any more
thought to my question

01:41:41.362 --> 01:41:44.230
about what you want to
be when you grow up?

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:45.910
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
