00:00.990 --> 00:02.560
Previously on Enterprise:

00:03.440 --> 00:05.130
How do you plan to get inside it?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.920
We're pretty sure we found a way in.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.920
I'm sending a crew in shuttlepod.

00:09.190 --> 00:12.500
The spheres are controlled by
a network of artificial intelligence.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.820
This section houses the redundant memory core.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.500
It should contain a significant amount of information.

00:18.770 --> 00:21.310
We're hoping that'll include
data on the sphere builders.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.600
I'll be at your side, no matter what happens.

00:31.130 --> 00:33.590
We've taken control of the weapon.

00:34.340 --> 00:35.910
We're going to launch it.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.290
Wait!

00:43.470 --> 00:46.000
We have an image of your ship firing.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.250
They left me no choice.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.380
And you've left me no choice.

00:50.850 --> 00:56.790
The crew of that ship are
the last Xindi you'll ever betray.

00:56.940 --> 01:00.760
The weapon cannot be launched
without three of the codes.

01:01.190 --> 01:04.110
Do you really believe we haven't considered that?

01:06.030 --> 01:07.370
Hoshi?

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.630 --> 01:36.090
Why am I here?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.560
What do you want?!

01:37.670 --> 01:40.540
We were impressed with your linguistic abilities.

01:40.780 --> 01:42.980
Aquatic is difficult to master.

01:42.980 --> 01:45.470
I've heard it spoken my entire life, ...

01:45.470 --> 01:47.800
but still, it doesn't come easily to me.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.280
Maybe you should have applied yourself more.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.630
We have some encoded data
we need translated.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.510
-I'm not a cryptologist.
-I have confidence in your abilities.

01:58.980 --> 02:02.080
That's very flattering, but you'll have
to manage on your own.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.340
If you refuse,
we'll have no further use for you.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.710
Get her ready for the procedure.

02:18.090 --> 02:22.040
She's surprisingly strong-willed for a primate.

02:25.570 --> 02:30.090
We'll see how defiant she is after
our surgeons have finished with her.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.480
We'll have the launch codes soon enough.

04:14.110 --> 04:15.627
We need to access the data from this.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.740
Meet me in the command center
in half an hour.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.560
-I'll assist you.
-What have we missed?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.000
The Reptilians took the weapon.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.830
-Have they launched it?
- We don't know.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.640
The captain's on his way to the surface,
wants to figure out our next move.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.930
They took Hoshi.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.550
-She's gone.
- Who?

04:28.550 --> 04:30.700
Reptilians, Insectoids...
We don't know.

04:30.810 --> 04:32.890
They transported her off the bridge.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.370
Where's Corporal Hawkins?

04:38.230 --> 04:42.650
The Sphere had an automated defense mechanism.

04:43.430 --> 04:44.560
He was killed.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.380
I'm sorry, Major.

04:51.030 --> 04:53.650
Well, I'm sure you did everything you could.

04:54.530 --> 04:56.150
I'd appreciate a full report.

05:08.710 --> 05:09.660
Where are they?

05:09.660 --> 05:11.970
We are trying to determine their location.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.320
It's difficult to track them inside a vortex.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.010
For all you know, they could be heading to Earth.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.710
They can't deploy the weapon.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.790
Not yet.

05:19.140 --> 05:23.710
Each of the five species has a set of commands
to initiate the arming sequence.

05:23.710 --> 05:26.890
Three of them are needed
to activate the weapon.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.390
They only have two.

05:28.690 --> 05:30.840
We obviously don't intend to give them ours.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.240
What about the Aquatics?

05:32.330 --> 05:34.360
Their actions aren't easy to predict, ...

05:34.520 --> 05:37.310
but so far they seem determined not to take sides.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.520
It's more likely the Reptilians and Insectoids...

05:39.540 --> 05:42.710
will attempt to bypass the command codes themselves.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.170
And that will take time.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.900
They've abducted my communications officer.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.670
Up until now, I didn't know why.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.420
You believe they'll use her
to decrypt the arming sequence?

05:57.620 --> 05:59.110
She'll never cooperate.

05:59.270 --> 06:01.820
She may not have a choice.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.060
This could be a command subroutine.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.630
And it could be a letter to Santa Claus.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.850
I wouldn't mind having Hoshi here right now.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.720
We'll have to make do without her.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.410
I just hope she's okay.

06:20.010 --> 06:24.430
We're here to analyze this data,
not speculate on Ensign Sato's fate.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.430
You okay?

06:31.790 --> 06:33.550
I'm fond of Hoshi as well.

06:33.550 --> 06:36.920
But we can't allow her situation
to become a distraction.

06:39.060 --> 06:39.920
Any luck?

06:40.110 --> 06:42.380
There's a great deal of data to analyze, ....

06:42.380 --> 06:44.080
but we've made some progress.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.610
We know the Spheres are connected
by a subspace energy grid.

06:48.070 --> 06:51.550
But four of them appear
to be integral to that connection.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.200
The closest one's here.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.360
We've designated it Sphere 41.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.700
Integral how?

06:57.280 --> 07:01.510
I believe they act as control Spheres,
allowing the network to operate in concert.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.290
If we can damage one of them,...

07:05.820 --> 07:07.740
would it disrupt the entire grid?

07:08.420 --> 07:09.270
Maybe.

07:09.740 --> 07:11.370
It also might have no effect.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.440
We just don't have enough information yet.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.720
Keep at it.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.120
Aye, sir.

07:19.310 --> 07:22.050
Cooperate and this won't be necessary.

07:24.790 --> 07:25.640
Wait.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.440
After the injection,
the parasites will invade your neocortex.

07:31.950 --> 07:35.480
Once they begin reconfiguring your synaptic pathways,...

07:35.480 --> 07:37.880
you'll be much more compliant.

07:38.760 --> 07:45.280
Before your primate brain is
too badly damaged to understand,

07:45.510 --> 07:50.860
I want to thank you for helping us
destroy your world.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.270
If they'd stayed in the vortex,
we wouldn't have found them.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.830
They're less than four light-years from here.

08:10.830 --> 08:11.800
Why have they stopped?

08:11.800 --> 08:13.520
They could've been halfway to Earth by now.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.410
They're attempting to arm the weapon.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.860
The propulsion system has to be off-line to do it.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.680
How quickly can we get there?

08:20.680 --> 08:22.300
That wouldn't be wise.

08:22.430 --> 08:24.770
They've been joined by at least a dozen vessels.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.510
You have nearly as many ships.

08:26.550 --> 08:31.300
You may have noticed that Reptilians and Insectoids
are more belligerent than we are.

08:31.450 --> 08:34.299
Their ships are armed accordingly.

08:34.590 --> 08:35.960
We're no match for them.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.120
We've been outgunned before, sir.

08:38.190 --> 08:40.750
We did not come all this way
to give up without a fight.

08:43.450 --> 08:45.400
Would the Aquatics be a match for them?

08:45.570 --> 08:48.020
Their ships are extremely powerful.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.470
But they've seen your evidence.

08:50.470 --> 08:52.290
-They're not convinced.
- That was before...

08:52.290 --> 08:55.290
the Reptilians murdered Degra and stole the weapon.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.160
We're looking at civil war.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.710
Can they afford to sit back and do nothing?

09:01.540 --> 09:03.410
Let me talk to them.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.080
Now isn't the time to dissolve the Council.

09:20.620 --> 09:25.030
So we should leave our fate
in the hands of the Reptilians and Insectoids?

09:29.940 --> 09:31.200
I disagree.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.940
The evidence the humans provided can't be ignored.

09:39.670 --> 09:42.050
I didn't quite catch that last part.

09:42.050 --> 09:44.810
They've agreed to meet with us.

09:44.910 --> 09:47.300
But don't expect much, Captain.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.400
How long do they plan to keep us waiting?

10:00.480 --> 10:03.770
You have to deal with the Aquatics on their terms.

10:04.230 --> 10:08.350
They're extremely deliberate
in everything they do.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.290
You all right?

10:16.380 --> 10:18.950
My species doesn't like the water.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.230
They're here.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.130
Thank you for seeing me.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.330
I'm afraid my Communications Officer was abducted
by the Reptilians.

10:32.170 --> 10:36.190
That is regrettable, but her presence
is no longer necessary.

10:36.190 --> 10:39.010
We've had time to study your language.

10:39.010 --> 10:41.630
Then I'll get to the point.

10:42.110 --> 10:43.190
We need your help.

10:43.630 --> 10:45.790
We've made our position clear.

10:45.790 --> 10:49.260
Your evidence is intriguing,
but far from conclusive.

10:49.380 --> 10:52.190
We require more time to evaluate it.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.370
And if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime...?

10:55.440 --> 10:59.450
The Reptilians and the Insectoids cannot deploy
the weapon on their own.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.600
That may not be true.

11:01.770 --> 11:05.310
I believe they took my officer
to help them decipher Launch Codes

11:06.100 --> 11:10.440
After all your deliberations, you may find
a decision's been made without you.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.340
This changes nothing.

11:12.470 --> 11:15.450
Just because the Reptilians chose to act rashly ...

11:15.450 --> 11:17.790
does not mean we will do the same.

11:17.890 --> 11:20.260
So, you'd rather sit back and do nothing...

11:20.300 --> 11:23.170
while they condemn all five of your species to extinction.

11:23.210 --> 11:24.680
You may return to your ship.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.950
You will be informed of our decision.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.750
One last question.

11:28.850 --> 11:31.190
Have these Guardians...

11:31.360 --> 11:34.530
told you where you'll establish
your new home world?

11:35.130 --> 11:37.670
The one humans are destined to destroy?

11:38.810 --> 11:41.530
Is it here in the Expanse?

11:42.580 --> 11:44.530
In case you haven't noticed,...

11:44.680 --> 11:48.690
the Spheres are turning it into
a trans-dimensional wasteland.

11:48.690 --> 11:50.800
None of you will be able to survive.

11:53.460 --> 11:55.880
You say the Guardians have helped you.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.210
Have they ever tried to disable the Spheres?

11:59.770 --> 12:01.680
Because we've found a way.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.020
Help me save my people, ...

12:09.320 --> 12:11.420
and I can help you save yours.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.510
Report.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.180
She's penetrated the first layer of encryption.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.100
Nothing further.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.540
Do you understand what we want you to do?

12:52.490 --> 12:56.380
I'm to bypass the Aquatic encryption protocols.

12:57.330 --> 13:01.680
And you realize we need this done quickly.

13:01.700 --> 13:05.260
I'm not familiar with these ciphers.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.740
I'm trying.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.720
Are you?

13:18.070 --> 13:20.410
She's more resistant than I imagined.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.970
Prepare her for another procedure.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.500
You would sacrifice yourself to stop us.

13:48.210 --> 13:52.710
Don't worry, you won't have
to live with your guilt for long.

13:58.410 --> 13:59.650
Commander.

13:59.950 --> 14:02.350
I can't access the arming matrix.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.900
She's added a layer of encryption.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.900
You were ordered to watch her!

14:15.490 --> 14:18.100
A deflector pulse might disrupt the subspace links.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.390
It wouldn't generate enough power.

14:22.430 --> 14:25.350
We could tie the impulse reactors
directly into the array.

14:25.550 --> 14:28.740
Sure, if you want to rupture
every EPS conduit on the ship.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.190
The captain told the Aquatics
we could disable these Spheres.

14:33.310 --> 14:35.550
And I'm trying not to make a liar out of him.

14:36.350 --> 14:37.110
Really.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.240
What do you mean by that?

14:39.300 --> 14:41.970
You've dismissed all of my proposals.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.360
When you come up with one
that doesn't involve blowing ourselves up,...

14:45.360 --> 14:47.210
I'll be a little more enthusiastic.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.250
Or you might surprise me
with an idea of your own.

14:54.870 --> 14:56.620
Maybe you haven't had time
to meditate...

14:56.620 --> 14:57.710
I don't know.

14:57.910 --> 15:00.620
But whatever's going on with you lately,
I've had about enough.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.700
I'll work on this in Engineering.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.700
Call me if you have any more brilliant ideas.

15:06.790 --> 15:07.740
Commander.

15:08.530 --> 15:09.380
Trip.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.360
Everything that's...

15:18.880 --> 15:21.820
happened recently, it's caused me to become...

15:22.530 --> 15:23.810
slightly emotional.

15:26.790 --> 15:27.910
I've noticed.

15:28.740 --> 15:30.080
I apologize.

15:31.210 --> 15:32.430
Forget about it.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.430
I wish I could.

15:36.340 --> 15:39.190
It may take some time
before I regain my control.

15:41.930 --> 15:44.480
It will be difficult to do, especially...

15:45.670 --> 15:46.690
on my own.

15:49.850 --> 15:52.190
This hasn't been easy for any of us.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.210
You know how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

16:06.120 --> 16:10.030
When this is all over,
if you want to talk, I'm all ears.

16:15.970 --> 16:18.370
Why don't we take another crack at this?

16:20.660 --> 16:22.670
The council has disbanded.

16:22.820 --> 16:25.240
The weapon is under our control.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.450
Excellent.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.910
Deploy it immediately.

16:27.910 --> 16:31.000
As soon as we decrypt a third launch code.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.880
We have encountered some...

16:32.880 --> 16:34.200
difficulties.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.180
The longer you delay, the more likely
the time lines will shift against you.

16:38.180 --> 16:43.660
Then perhaps you can provide
more of your valuable assistance.

16:44.930 --> 16:46.720
Help us get the code.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.180
That's not possible.

16:49.180 --> 16:52.610
It should be a simple matter
to peer into the past.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.400
Extract the necessary data.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.140
We only detect large fluctuations in the timescape.

16:59.630 --> 17:02.140
The fine details are obscured.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.330
Really?

17:04.260 --> 17:09.770
You've seen more than enough detail
to learn how to meddle in our affairs--

17:09.770 --> 17:12.380
to turn the Xindi species against each other.

17:12.380 --> 17:16.410
Everything we've done has been
to protect the Xindi.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.970
Then finish what you've started, ...

17:19.579 --> 17:22.500
if it's within your power.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.300
The timelines are in constant flux.

17:25.300 --> 17:29.080
Many of them favor the primates and the arborials.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.090
Some even favor the humans.

17:32.570 --> 17:34.820
Unless that's the outcome you desire,...

17:34.820 --> 17:38.030
I suggest you find a way to launch the weapon.

17:47.930 --> 17:49.650
This appears to be some kind of...

17:49.650 --> 17:52.650
interspatial manifold on the surface of Sphere 41.

17:52.860 --> 17:54.550
What they used to connect the spheres?

17:54.550 --> 17:56.030
That's what we're thinking.

17:56.090 --> 17:58.600
T'Pol's figured out a way to target it
with a deflector pulse.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.860
Well done.

18:00.170 --> 18:03.120
We haven't exactly got
all the details worked out yet.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.020
Then you'd better keep at it.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.320
If the Aquatics decide to help us,...

18:07.320 --> 18:09.130
they might want to hear those details.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.330
Captain,...

18:10.620 --> 18:12.630
hope you didn't make them any promises.

18:14.990 --> 18:16.360
We'll keep working.

18:16.510 --> 18:17.710
Please do.

18:25.150 --> 18:26.330
Any word?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.390
It's only been three hours.

18:29.190 --> 18:32.790
The Council once needed
to resolve a simple logistical matter.

18:32.940 --> 18:36.490
It took the Aquatics six days
to agree to attend the meeting.

18:37.230 --> 18:39.990
I'm surprised you were ever able
to get anything done.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.670
On the contrary, ...

18:41.780 --> 18:46.760
their prudence was usually the only thing
that kept the Council from dissolving in the chaos.

18:46.830 --> 18:49.420
That's why Degra had them build the weapon.

18:49.470 --> 18:53.350
He didn't want the Reptilians and Insectoids
to have too much control.

18:53.490 --> 18:56.160
That's actually something I wanted to discuss with you.

18:56.850 --> 19:00.640
If we're successful and
we destroy the weapon...

19:01.120 --> 19:04.000
What's to prevent us from building another one?

19:05.530 --> 19:07.000
I knew Degra for many years.

19:07.420 --> 19:10.660
He could be difficult, uncompromising.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.880
We argued often.

19:13.090 --> 19:16.560
For instance, when he insisted
that we meet with you.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.760
But when Degra spoke,
only a fool would ignore him.

19:21.730 --> 19:25.870
He believed there was a future
between your people and ours ...

19:26.660 --> 19:27.990
when this is over.

19:29.130 --> 19:30.990
I intend to see if he was right.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.770
Captain Archer, please report to the Bridge.

19:37.770 --> 19:38.380
Report.

19:38.650 --> 19:41.290
Six vessels approaching, sir!
all Aquatic.

19:41.490 --> 19:43.690
That was remarkably fast.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.250
Open a channel to the lead ship.

19:48.870 --> 19:51.010
We've considered your proposal.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.170
And?

19:52.410 --> 19:55.060
We will help you intercept the weapon.

20:00.050 --> 20:00.920
Thank you.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.060
We expect you to honor our agreement.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.830
You will attempt to disable the Spheres.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.120
How do these developments affect the timeline?

20:15.270 --> 20:17.050
It's difficult to say.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.920
They continue to fluctuate.

20:19.090 --> 20:24.280
However, most now indicate
that the humans will prevail.

20:25.250 --> 20:28.640
Then the time has come
for us to intervene.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.520
Is there another problem?

20:30.690 --> 20:32.360
Quite the opposite.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.960
The third launch code?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.300
We have complete access.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.900
It appears the primate was useful after all.

20:46.460 --> 20:47.930
Take her back to her cell.

20:49.150 --> 20:51.510
Initiate the pre-arming protocols.

20:51.510 --> 20:54.280
Inform me when the weapon is ready for launch.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.930
Captain's Starlog, February 13, 2154.

21:00.850 --> 21:03.220
We're preparing to enter a Xindi vortex, ...

21:03.220 --> 21:05.720
thanks to some help from the Aquatics.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.970
If everything goes as planned, ...

21:07.970 --> 21:10.970
we'll intercept the weapon
in less than two hours.

21:11.340 --> 21:14.010
Enterprise may be coming apart at the seams,...

21:14.010 --> 21:16.250
but I can't say the same for the crew.

21:16.350 --> 21:18.830
After nearly eight months in the Expanse,...

21:18.830 --> 21:21.170
they're ready to do what they came to do, ...

21:21.280 --> 21:24.870
no matter what it takes,
no matter what the cost.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.690
Have you assembled your boarding party?

21:49.150 --> 21:51.140
Ready to deploy on your command.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.160
I wish I was leading it myself.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.430
Your place is on the Bridge, sir.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.430
No offense, Major,...

21:58.850 --> 22:01.920
it's just that Ensign Sato is a friend.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.480
Here's my report on Corporal Hawkins.

22:10.070 --> 22:11.480
Thank you.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.330
Would you like to go over my rescue plan?

22:14.330 --> 22:16.200
First, I'd like to know if...

22:16.620 --> 22:18.220
we have a problem.

22:18.860 --> 22:19.650
Sir?

22:19.980 --> 22:22.650
If you blame me for the corporal's death.

22:25.310 --> 22:26.650
Permission to speak freely?

22:28.300 --> 22:31.400
I've never liked putting my people
under someone else's command.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.150
You're Senior Tactical Officer,
but they're my team.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.380
And I can't help but think that...

22:39.660 --> 22:42.090
if I'd been there,
things might've turned out differently.

22:42.350 --> 22:43.820
I did everything I could.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.330
Things happened very fast.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.360
-I understand.
-I'm not finished.

22:47.990 --> 22:50.290
Hawkins may well have been a MACO...

22:52.530 --> 22:55.500
...but he was my responsibility out there.

23:04.630 --> 23:07.210
When we first came aboard Enterprise,...

23:07.780 --> 23:09.840
we definitely felt like outsiders.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.010
If I contributed to that,...

23:11.010 --> 23:13.340
-I apologize.
-My point is...

23:13.710 --> 23:15.760
none of us feel that way anymore.

23:16.990 --> 23:20.080
We're all part of the same crew,
no matter which uniform we wear.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.340
Don't worry about Ensign Sato.

23:25.250 --> 23:26.610
We'll bring her home.

23:45.170 --> 23:47.680
I'd almost forgotten
what Chef can do with a steak.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.890
I hope the crew forgives me for not
patching up the galley sooner.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.880
I've heard no complaints.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.640
Except from Chef, of course.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.890
When this is all over, I plan on having a little chat ...

24:01.890 --> 24:05.660
with the Starfleet quartermaster
about what they put in those ration packs.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.660
When this is all over...

24:09.020 --> 24:10.340
I won't be complaining about the food,...

24:10.340 --> 24:13.050
I'll just be happy to get back
to our original mission.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.870
Hope you plan on swinging by Earth first.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.180
I told the Engineering team...

24:18.460 --> 24:20.570
I'd buy them a few rounds at the 602 Club.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.810
You're both invited, of course.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.430
I wouldn't miss it.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.230
What about you?

24:31.040 --> 24:32.820
You may buy me a drink, if you wish.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.070
I meant, what are your plans for the future.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.530
It's been a long time
since you've been to Vulcan.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.760
The High Command would be lucky to get you back.

24:44.730 --> 24:47.650
There are some colleagues
I'd enjoy seeing again.

24:49.280 --> 24:54.420
But I've considered formalizing
my service with Starfleet.

24:57.850 --> 25:00.150
I may be able to pull some strings, ...

25:00.430 --> 25:01.970
get you out of basic training.

25:02.540 --> 25:04.740
Can you imagine the look on Soval's face when...

25:04.740 --> 25:06.640
he sees her in a Starfleet uniform?

25:07.500 --> 25:08.950
Please let me be there.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.060
I said I was considering it.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.550
Bridge to the captain.

25:14.970 --> 25:15.940
Go ahead.

25:16.150 --> 25:17.780
We're approaching the coordinates.

25:17.870 --> 25:19.840
Tactical Alert.
I'm on my way.

25:24.150 --> 25:25.560
Activate the reactor.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.950
Yes, Lieutenant.

25:36.910 --> 25:40.240
Commander Dolim,
the final arming sequence has begun.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.550
Excellent.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.220
Inform me when you are ready.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.480
I'll be in my thermal chamber.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.680
- What is it?
- A vortex is opening.

25:50.890 --> 25:52.130
Where?

25:52.450 --> 25:55.260
Bearing 2-7-9,
range 4,000 kilometers.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.610
Were you expecting reinforcements?

25:58.890 --> 26:00.140
No.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.420
Arboreals.

26:13.830 --> 26:15.870
Send a patrol to intercept them.

26:16.010 --> 26:17.780
More vortexes are opening.

26:17.780 --> 26:19.120
Fourteen...

26:19.370 --> 26:20.630
18 ships.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.110
Aquatics!
Six ships approaching the weapon.

26:29.110 --> 26:30.550
Target them!

26:31.490 --> 26:35.500
Have Commander Kolo's squadron maintain position!

26:39.530 --> 26:40.870
They're moving to intercept,...

26:40.910 --> 26:43.650
but they're keeping a substantial force
around the weapon.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.650
Feel like taking them on?

26:46.650 --> 26:48.230
Give me the word, sir.

26:54.620 --> 26:56.300
This is Captain Archer.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.540
Cut us loose.

27:07.900 --> 27:08.870
Sir...

27:08.870 --> 27:10.230
the humans.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.800
Steady, Travis.

27:27.450 --> 27:28.340
They're breaking off.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.730
Have all ships concentrate
their fire on the weapon.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.250
We're in range.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.290
Fire.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.460
They're targeting the primary generators!

27:51.460 --> 27:53.220
Continue the arming sequence!

27:56.940 --> 27:58.980
Minor damage to the starboard nacelle.

27:59.010 --> 27:59.940
We're still in the fight.

27:59.940 --> 28:01.740
Bring us around for another pass.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.800
Target the Earth vessel!

28:07.900 --> 28:10.330
We can't, sir!
the Aquatics are protecting them.

28:19.650 --> 28:22.310
Captain, I've located Ensign Sato.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.760
She's onboard one of the Reptilian vessels.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.380
Can you get a transporter lock?

28:27.380 --> 28:30.850
She's somewhere on the first three decks.
I can't pinpoint her exact location.

28:30.850 --> 28:32.630
Send Major Hayes and his team.

28:32.630 --> 28:33.660
Aye, sir.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.770
We've lost eight vessels.

29:07.770 --> 29:09.520
We've only disabled two of theirs.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.340
We're no match for the Aquatics.

29:11.340 --> 29:12.500
Lieutenant!

29:12.570 --> 29:14.550
We must deploy the weapon now!

29:14.550 --> 29:16.400
We need another five minutes.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.240
In another five minutes, ...

29:21.270 --> 29:24.630
it will be destroyed and you along with it!

29:51.440 --> 29:52.730
Ensign.

29:53.470 --> 29:54.520
Ensign!

29:58.460 --> 30:00.000
Hayes to Enterprise.

30:01.570 --> 30:03.000
Enterprise, respond.

30:05.290 --> 30:07.310
We should get back to the beam-in point.

30:12.340 --> 30:14.850
The Reptilians are under attack.

30:14.850 --> 30:18.730
If we don't act,
the weapon will be destroyed.

30:18.940 --> 30:23.330
The timelines now indicate
that is the likely outcome.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.580
Proceed.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.990
Captain, there's a massive anomaly
forming near the weapon.

30:45.430 --> 30:46.650
Two more.

30:53.730 --> 30:55.310
Keep us clear of them, Travis.

30:55.310 --> 30:56.710
We'll have to pull back.

30:56.710 --> 30:58.700
Do what you can, but keep us in firing range.

30:58.820 --> 30:59.790
Aye, sir.

31:12.890 --> 31:14.480
-Captain Archer!
- Go ahead.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.450
The anomalies are creating a barrier
between us and the weapon.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.360
We can't get through.

31:41.270 --> 31:42.890
Hayes to Enterprise.

31:42.890 --> 31:43.830
Go ahead.

31:43.830 --> 31:45.400
We've got Sato.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.430
Archer to Tucker.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.170
Lock on to Major Hayes.

31:53.190 --> 31:54.460
I wish I could, sir.

31:56.370 --> 31:59.150
That last anomaly knocked the transporter off-line.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.860
Tell them to stand by.

32:04.110 --> 32:05.380
Archer to Hayes.

32:05.540 --> 32:07.400
We've got a malfunction.

32:08.050 --> 32:09.870
Can you hold your position?

32:10.030 --> 32:11.470
Affirmative.

32:32.980 --> 32:35.470
The intruders are trapped on level seven.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.080
And the anomalies?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.780
They've disabled three of the Aquatic ships.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.570
The Guardians will not let us fail.

32:50.570 --> 32:51.320
Tucker to Hayes.

32:51.550 --> 32:52.280
Go ahead.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.060
I'm ready to get you out,
but I can only transport two at a time.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.200
And then I have to reset the buffer.

32:57.890 --> 32:58.610
Take her.

32:58.790 --> 33:01.200
Lock on Kelly and Sato.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.480
Ready for two more.

33:23.570 --> 33:24.900
You two are next.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.500
I could use a change of scenery.

33:42.810 --> 33:44.490
Stand by, Major.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.260
Commander Dolim.

34:01.260 --> 34:02.660
What's your status?

34:03.360 --> 34:05.520
We've completed the arming sequence.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.199
Captain...

34:10.650 --> 34:13.030
the power readings from the weapon are increasing.

34:13.030 --> 34:14.739
They're preparing to launch.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.300
Get us close, Travis.

34:20.370 --> 34:22.040
What about the anomalies?

34:22.040 --> 34:23.679
I said, take us in.

34:25.170 --> 34:25.909
Aye, sir.

34:27.020 --> 34:29.480
Ready to launch on your order, Commander.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.070
Open a vortex.

34:31.420 --> 34:33.580
Set a course for Earth.

34:54.469 --> 34:55.580
They're gone.

35:08.150 --> 35:08.950
Doctor.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.550
I told him I was ready for duty.

35:13.140 --> 35:15.390
I'm afraid he's a bit of a mother hen.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.670
How's Ensign Sato?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.110
Her bio-signs are stable.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.820
Thank you for bringing her home.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.400
All in a day's work.

35:40.540 --> 35:42.510
Use Mackenzie.

35:43.030 --> 35:44.020
What?

35:45.130 --> 35:46.720
She knows the team.

35:47.730 --> 35:48.860
Rely on her.

35:49.340 --> 35:50.670
No more of that talk.

35:50.670 --> 35:51.910
That's an order.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.700
Cardio-stimulator.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.090
Step away, please.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.700
Increase by point two joules.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.060
How long before it reaches Earth?

36:26.200 --> 36:27.080
Ten hours.

36:29.410 --> 36:31.570
Could an Aquatic ship reach it in time?

36:31.570 --> 36:32.270
Doubtful.

36:32.270 --> 36:34.890
They have powerful weapons,
but their speed is limited.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.360
Degra's ship is considerably faster.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.500
What are we waiting for?

36:38.600 --> 36:39.820
The ship isn't well armed.

36:39.820 --> 36:41.690
It would be useless against the weapon.

36:42.810 --> 36:44.690
We might be able to get a team onboard, ...

36:45.030 --> 36:46.650
disable it from the inside.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.350
The Reptilians will have soldiers
stationed aboard the weapon.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.300
We'll deal with them when we get there.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.910
Captain!

36:54.360 --> 36:56.640
The Aquatics joined us only because you...

36:56.640 --> 36:59.110
promised to neutralize the Spheres.

36:59.380 --> 37:02.070
They expect you to fulfill that promise.

37:02.070 --> 37:04.800
The future of our people is at stake, as well.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.210
Are you ready?

37:08.140 --> 37:09.240
I believe so.

37:09.740 --> 37:12.370
We have a plan to disable Sphere 41.

37:12.740 --> 37:15.410
If we're right,
it should disrupt the entire network.

37:15.410 --> 37:17.240
Then, as soon as we undock,...

37:17.240 --> 37:19.060
set a course for Sphere 41.

37:34.540 --> 37:35.770
At ease.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.230
I've just come from Sick Bay,...

37:39.420 --> 37:41.770
where the doctor assures me that Sergeant Kemper ...

37:41.860 --> 37:44.770
and Ensign Sato will make full recoveries.

37:46.410 --> 37:50.450
Unfortunately, Major Hayes' injures were more severe.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.680
He didn't survive.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.310
I'm sorry.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.150
We've got less than ten hours
before this weapon reaches Earth.

38:01.590 --> 38:04.220
The captain wants to take
a team aboard to destroy it.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.890
I don't imagine the Reptilians will make this easy for us, ...

38:09.250 --> 38:10.890
but that's why you're here.

38:11.570 --> 38:14.950
That's why Major Hayes picked
each one of you for this mission.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.290
Because he knew you'd get the job done.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.260
I need three volunteers.

38:27.470 --> 38:28.590
Woods.

38:29.020 --> 38:30.370
Ramira.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.140
Forbes.

38:33.430 --> 38:37.100
Assemble your gear.
Meet me at the starboard airlock in ten minutes.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.210
How is she?

38:57.090 --> 38:57.900
Stable.

38:58.720 --> 39:01.400
The Xindi parasites were
no match for my osmotic eel.

39:02.210 --> 39:03.360
I need to talk to her.

39:04.030 --> 39:05.730
She's undergone a severe neural trauma.

39:05.730 --> 39:08.240
She's been inside the weapon.
I have to know what she saw.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.710
It should be safe to revive her in two hours.

39:12.710 --> 39:13.900
No less.

39:17.370 --> 39:18.170
All right.

39:18.750 --> 39:20.990
Have her taken aboard Degra's ship right away.

39:20.990 --> 39:22.440
She's in no condition to be moved.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.950
I don't have any choice, Doctor.

39:23.950 --> 39:25.420
You could kill her.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.980
I want her on that ship in 20 minutes.

39:27.980 --> 39:29.330
She'll need another cortical treatment.

39:29.330 --> 39:30.340
At least let me come with you.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.090
There's a medical bay aboard Degra's ship.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.450
Show Lieutenant Reed how to do it.

39:33.450 --> 39:35.200
-He's not a doctor.
- Phlox...

39:37.220 --> 39:38.640
you're needed here.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.280
The Insectoids.

40:03.310 --> 40:04.760
We were fortunate.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.810
He also started a civil war
between our species.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.260
Degra was a traitor.

40:25.730 --> 40:29.200
Then it's a good thing we already have
your launch codes.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.040
Lock weapons on their ship.

40:35.010 --> 40:35.570
Sir?

40:35.570 --> 40:38.080
I won't risk any more interference.

40:40.110 --> 40:41.100
Fire.

40:57.470 --> 40:58.260
Malcolm.

40:58.510 --> 40:59.430
Hang on.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.480
Bring me back a piece of that weapon.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.880
A souvenir.

41:07.740 --> 41:08.820
With pleasure.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.820
All set, sir.

41:12.090 --> 41:14.460
When we're finished, ...

41:14.560 --> 41:16.260
we'll meet you at the rendezvous coordinates.

41:16.260 --> 41:18.580
We'll be there.
Captain.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.310
Good luck.

41:25.470 --> 41:27.480
I expect you to keep him in line.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.330
I'll do my best.
