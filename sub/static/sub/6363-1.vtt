Welcome, guys.

<i>Graham is just,

<i>But I am so excited

<i>And I'm ready to bring home
the trophy back to Louisiana</i>

Hurricane Avery

something else as well.

[suspenseful music]

03:36.845 --> 03:40.113
You guys need one more thing:

03:40.148 --> 03:41.514
One of these.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.683
[cheering]

03:43.719 --> 03:45.986
A MasterChef white apron.

03:46.021 --> 03:47.654
[shouting excitedly]

03:47.689 --> 03:50.757
Now, you've all earned an apron,

03:50.792 --> 03:53.827
but this is MasterChef Junior.

03:53.862 --> 03:55.462
We are not gonna
make it that easy.

03:55.497 --> 03:56.796
[groaning]

03:56.832 --> 03:58.109
- Oh, whatever.
- Of course you aren't.

03:58.133 --> 03:59.766
You'll find those aprons

03:59.801 --> 04:03.103
in one of the scariest places
inside this kitchen.

04:03.138 --> 04:04.371
- [gasps]
- Where?

04:04.406 --> 04:05.839
I'm scared.

04:09.911 --> 04:11.378
- Whoa, wait.
- What?

04:11.413 --> 04:12.712
What's going on?

04:12.748 --> 04:17.851
A place you'll
all have to get inside.

04:17.886 --> 04:18.851
Oh, no.

04:18.887 --> 04:19.952
You'll find them...

04:19.988 --> 04:21.488
Say it.

04:21.523 --> 04:23.590
[suspenseful music]

04:23.625 --> 04:26.359
- Oh, my God!
- What the heck?

04:26.395 --> 04:28.094
It's his head!

04:28.130 --> 04:31.431
Oh, my gosh!
It's his head!

04:31.466 --> 04:32.966
It's his head!

04:33.001 --> 04:34.834
[kids shouting]

04:34.870 --> 04:37.837
What the heck happened
to you, Gordon?

04:37.873 --> 04:39.139
It's a piñata!

04:39.174 --> 04:40.774
It's a piñata!

04:40.809 --> 04:42.709
- It's a piñata!
- Get me a stick!

04:42.744 --> 04:43.710
That's right.

04:43.745 --> 04:45.078
All of your aprons

04:45.113 --> 04:47.947
are inside Gordon's
giant piñata head.

04:47.983 --> 04:52.052
Grab some kitchen utensils
behind you and get them out.

04:52.087 --> 04:53.720
Gordon Ramsay already had
a big head.

04:53.755 --> 04:55.055
Now look at this thing.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.690
<i>It's 50 times bigger,</i>

04:56.725 --> 04:58.603
and we get to whack at it
and bust out the aprons.

04:58.627 --> 05:01.461
Are you all ready to hit
my face as hard as you can?

05:01.496 --> 05:03.430
(all)
Yes, Chef!

05:03.465 --> 05:05.098
- Go!
- Attack it!

05:05.133 --> 05:08.134
[kids shouting]

05:09.371 --> 05:10.470
Killing it.

05:10.505 --> 05:13.973
[kids shouting]

05:14.009 --> 05:15.975
My nose!

05:16.011 --> 05:18.044
Watch my hair!

05:21.516 --> 05:23.049
It's like <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

05:23.085 --> 05:24.684
Apron!

05:24.720 --> 05:26.052
[screeching]

05:26.088 --> 05:27.088
My baby!

05:27.122 --> 05:28.354
Mia, Mia!

05:28.390 --> 05:29.355
Take it!

05:29.391 --> 05:30.423
Yay!

05:30.459 --> 05:31.524
Well done.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.793
- Head to your stations.
- Yay.

05:33.829 --> 05:35.095
Getting a MasterChef apron

05:35.130 --> 05:37.430
is like getting a black belt
in karate.

05:37.466 --> 05:39.999
It means I'm officially a chef.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.135
(all)
Bye, Gordon.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.137
My head hurts.

05:44.172 --> 05:46.372
Now you're all about to face

05:46.408 --> 05:49.008
your very first
mystery box challenge

05:49.044 --> 05:52.812
here in the MasterChef kitchen.

05:52.848 --> 05:55.915
You'll have to use whatever
you find under those boxes

05:55.951 --> 05:58.151
to make us one amazing dish.

05:58.186 --> 06:01.521
Whoever has the best dish
will get a huge advantage

06:01.556 --> 06:02.989
for the upcoming challenge.

06:03.024 --> 06:04.624
Now, on the count of three,

06:04.659 --> 06:06.960
I want you to lift your boxes.

06:06.995 --> 06:10.663
One, two, three.

06:10.699 --> 06:11.664
Lift!

06:11.700 --> 06:13.733
What?
Bread?

06:13.769 --> 06:15.401
[grunting]

06:15.437 --> 06:18.071
Oh, my...

06:18.106 --> 06:20.473
What is this thing?

06:20.509 --> 06:23.710
Under there, you have
one beautiful

06:23.745 --> 06:25.512
but empty bun.

06:25.547 --> 06:26.846
Thank you.

06:26.882 --> 06:28.381
What goes inside buns?

06:28.416 --> 06:29.382
Burgers!

06:29.417 --> 06:30.717
- Burgers!
- Burgers!

06:30.752 --> 06:33.119
America's undisputed
king of food.

06:33.155 --> 06:36.990
The average American eats
three hamburgers a week.

06:37.025 --> 06:38.558
What?

06:38.593 --> 06:40.894
So we want to see
your signature burger.

06:40.929 --> 06:42.629
Wow.

06:42.664 --> 06:44.998
But even burgers
don't like hanging out alone,

06:45.033 --> 06:47.500
so we want you to serve
your signature burgers

06:47.536 --> 06:49.135
with an incredible side.

06:49.171 --> 06:50.603
(Gordon)
You will all have access

06:50.639 --> 06:51.949
to a limited pantry
of ingredients

06:51.973 --> 06:54.140
to help make
those burgers shine.

06:54.176 --> 06:55.775
You'll find things like
ground beef,

06:55.811 --> 06:57.710
ground pork, ground bison,

06:57.746 --> 07:01.014
different kinds of buns,
cheeses, incredible vegetables.

07:01.049 --> 07:03.683
Is everybody ready
to make a knockout burger?

07:03.718 --> 07:05.585
(all)
Yes, Chef!

07:05.620 --> 07:06.753
Your one hour...

07:06.788 --> 07:08.688
starts now!

07:08.723 --> 07:10.056
[clock ticking]

07:10.091 --> 07:12.826
- Oh, my god.
- Oh!

07:12.861 --> 07:14.694
This is mayhem.

07:14.729 --> 07:15.962
Thank you.
You rock.

07:15.997 --> 07:18.498
Gigantic mixer coming through!

07:18.533 --> 07:20.533
Here we have young cooks
age 8 to 13

07:20.569 --> 07:21.835
representing the country...

07:21.870 --> 07:23.469
- Good luck, man.
- Thanks, you too.

07:23.505 --> 07:26.739
And tonight we have
12 states in the house.

07:26.775 --> 07:28.675
- Where's some jalapenos?
- Right there.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.343
This thing is huge.

07:30.378 --> 07:33.012
This is my first season
of MasterChef Junior,

07:33.048 --> 07:36.482
and just watching them cook
is incredible to me.

07:36.518 --> 07:37.884
We can do this.

07:37.919 --> 07:39.452
And every year,
they're just getting

07:39.487 --> 07:40.498
stronger and better
and better and better.

07:40.522 --> 07:41.487
It's just incredible.

07:41.523 --> 07:42.488
Perfect burger.

07:42.524 --> 07:44.958
Ha-ha, cha!

07:44.993 --> 07:46.826
Thank you.
I'm from Arizona,

07:46.862 --> 07:48.394
<i>so I'm making
a Southwestern burger</i>

07:48.430 --> 07:51.464
<i>with jalapenos
and a garlic French fry.</i>

07:51.499 --> 07:53.366
I'm an A-plus student,

07:53.401 --> 07:58.071
so I'm really hoping that I can
get an A-plus on this burger.

07:58.106 --> 07:59.672
I'm from Brooklyn.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.018
I'm making
just a regular bacon burger

08:01.042 --> 08:02.675
with some avocado mayonnaise,

08:02.711 --> 08:04.811
and on the side, we have a nice
pickled Asian slaw,

08:04.846 --> 08:06.679
which is a really big thing
in Brooklyn,

08:06.715 --> 08:08.047
so I made some of this

08:08.083 --> 08:10.483
so that I could be,
like, hometown proud.

08:12.087 --> 08:14.721
Ugh, why am I so short?

08:14.756 --> 08:16.100
I am going to make
an avocado relish

08:16.124 --> 08:18.091
<i>to go on my California
chipotle burger,</i>

08:18.126 --> 08:20.526
<i>with chipotle lime chips
on the side.</i>

08:20.562 --> 08:24.097
This is the first mystery box,
so I am nervous,

08:24.132 --> 08:25.965
but extremely excited.

08:26.001 --> 08:30.336
I'm gonna knock these judges
out of the park with my flavor.

08:30.372 --> 08:31.938
(Gordon)
25 minutes, guys.

08:31.973 --> 08:33.472
Let's go.

08:33.508 --> 08:34.674
Zac, where you from?

08:34.708 --> 08:35.942
I'm from Orlando, Florida.

08:35.977 --> 08:38.510
What kind of burger
are you cooking?

08:38.546 --> 08:41.681
A chuck and sirloin burger
with some onion rings.

08:41.716 --> 08:42.960
Do you think you've
got what it takes

08:42.984 --> 08:44.717
to become America's
next MasterChef?

08:44.753 --> 08:46.097
Even though I've only been
cooking for a year and a half,

08:46.121 --> 08:47.453
I am really, really good.

08:47.489 --> 08:51.824
- Wow, good luck.
- Thank you.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.660
- Avery, how we doing?
- Good.

08:53.695 --> 08:54.661
Tell me what the dish is.

08:54.696 --> 08:56.362
What are you making?

08:56.398 --> 08:59.499
I'm making a pork
and ground venison burger,

08:59.534 --> 09:01.701
a jazzy cole slaw, Creole sauce,

09:01.736 --> 09:03.503
and Southern sweet potato chips.

09:03.538 --> 09:06.472
- Good luck, Avery.
- Good luck, okay, Avery?

09:06.508 --> 09:08.007
- Ian, how you doing?
- Pretty good.

09:08.043 --> 09:09.620
Now, remind me your age
and where you're from.

09:09.644 --> 09:10.877
8 years old,

09:10.912 --> 09:12.323
and I'm from
Beverly Shores, Indiana.

09:12.347 --> 09:13.446
Tell me about this burger.

09:13.481 --> 09:15.014
It's gonna be a bison burger

09:15.050 --> 09:17.517
with melted American cheese
on it, with French fries.

09:17.552 --> 09:18.829
Who teaches you at home to cook?

09:18.853 --> 09:20.386
It was probably
both of my parents,

09:20.422 --> 09:22.755
because my dad
owns a restaurant.

09:22.791 --> 09:24.502
How much would it cost to go
eat in mom and dad's restaurant?

09:24.526 --> 09:26.003
Because it's my mom
and dad's restaurant,

09:26.027 --> 09:27.060
I get to eat free.

09:27.095 --> 09:28.695
Yeah, not you.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.074
I'm talking about me,
if I had to go pay.

09:30.098 --> 09:31.676
Because you have
a lot of money, let's say...

09:31.700 --> 09:32.665
Because I what?

09:32.701 --> 09:33.833
Who told you that?

09:33.868 --> 09:35.501
Everybody knows
that you have money.

09:35.537 --> 09:36.502
[laughs]

09:36.538 --> 09:38.071
Come on, young man.

09:38.106 --> 09:39.339
What?

09:39.374 --> 09:40.940
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

09:40.976 --> 09:43.376
Last 13 minutes, guys.

09:43.411 --> 09:45.712
Oh, God, it's got to go back in.

09:45.747 --> 09:46.713
Kya, how we doing?

09:46.748 --> 09:48.047
Good.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.615
- How old are you?
- I'm 8 years old.

09:49.651 --> 09:52.852
Wow, so you are
the youngest one here.

09:52.887 --> 09:53.998
How does that make you feel?

09:54.022 --> 09:55.455
I think it gives me
an advantage,

09:55.490 --> 09:56.622
'cause age doesn't matter.

09:56.658 --> 09:58.891
It's more
your knowledge of food.

09:58.927 --> 10:00.860
Now, what is that burger?

10:00.895 --> 10:03.629
This is my wagyu burger

10:03.665 --> 10:05.565
with apple fries.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.500
So who taught you
how to cook, Kya?

10:07.535 --> 10:09.613
My mom taught me at first,
and then my dad taught me.

10:09.637 --> 10:11.137
All right, good luck, Kya.

10:11.172 --> 10:12.138
Thank you.

10:12.173 --> 10:13.506
That's not good.

10:13.541 --> 10:15.108
(Gordon)
2 1/2 minutes to go, guys.

10:15.143 --> 10:16.776
[trilling nervously]

10:16.811 --> 10:18.778
Wow, look at the energy in here.

10:18.813 --> 10:19.813
(Graham)
It's wild.

10:19.848 --> 10:21.080
(Gordon)
We have gone up to

10:21.116 --> 10:22.815
a completely different
level already.

10:22.851 --> 10:24.428
(Graham) Absolutely. You
have Chinese backgrounds...

10:24.452 --> 10:26.163
(Gordon) Yep, Latin-inspired,
French-inspired.

10:26.187 --> 10:28.955
I think that Avery
is a frontrunner right now.

10:28.990 --> 10:33.026
That burger, I mean,
it smells incredible.

10:33.061 --> 10:35.395
Kya seems like she
knows what she's doing.

10:35.430 --> 10:36.562
Totally.

10:36.598 --> 10:38.164
30 seconds to go.

10:40.568 --> 10:41.834
Make it count.

10:41.870 --> 10:42.980
Jeez Louise,
gotta get my cheese.

10:43.004 --> 10:44.170
- Ten...
- No!

10:44.205 --> 10:46.706
Nine, eight...

10:46.741 --> 10:47.774
I'm freaking out.

10:47.809 --> 10:50.610
(all)
Seven, six, five,

10:50.645 --> 10:53.646
four, three, two, one.

10:53.681 --> 10:54.647
And stop!

10:54.682 --> 10:57.750
Hands in the air!

10:59.198 --> 11:00.497
- Start plating!
- No!

11:00.532 --> 11:01.831
A knockout burger.

11:01.867 --> 11:05.302
(all)
Five, four, three,

11:05.337 --> 11:06.670
two, one, and stop!

11:06.705 --> 11:08.271
Hands in the air!

11:08.307 --> 11:09.617
[cheers and applause]
Good job, high five.

11:09.641 --> 11:11.374
Great job, well done.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.677
Now, every time
you cook in this kitchen,

11:13.712 --> 11:15.278
we miss nothing.

11:15.314 --> 11:16.880
We taste everything you cook.

11:16.915 --> 11:22.385
Now we want to look at the three
best dishes of the night.

11:22.421 --> 11:26.823
The first burger
we want to bring forward

11:26.858 --> 11:30.193
has gone in a very
non-traditional direction.

11:30.229 --> 11:32.429
The dish really celebrates

11:32.464 --> 11:35.298
where this young home cook
comes from.

11:35.334 --> 11:37.400
Please step forward...

11:37.436 --> 11:38.568
Avery!

11:38.604 --> 11:41.238
[cheers and applause]

11:41.273 --> 11:42.739
I can't believe it.

11:42.774 --> 11:45.542
Gordon Ramsay just called
my name up first.

11:45.577 --> 11:47.877
<i>I mean, I'm just a girl
from the Bayou,</i>

11:47.913 --> 11:50.814
and it's a really big honor.

11:50.849 --> 11:53.450
Avery, describe that
delicious-looking burger.

11:53.485 --> 11:55.785
Louisiana
is a sportsman's paradise,

11:55.821 --> 11:57.754
and my family loves to hunt,

11:57.789 --> 12:00.657
so I call this
a Sportsman's Paradise burger

12:00.692 --> 12:02.826
with a jazzy cole slaw
and a Creole spread,

12:02.861 --> 12:05.562
and as a side, some sweet
Southern potato chips.

12:05.597 --> 12:06.730
Excellent.

12:06.765 --> 12:07.897
What protein did you use?

12:07.933 --> 12:09.866
Pork and venison.

12:09.901 --> 12:11.701
Where'd you get the idea
of venison?

12:11.737 --> 12:13.570
- Venison is a lean meat...
- Yes.

12:13.605 --> 12:16.206
But pork also has fat in it,

12:16.241 --> 12:18.675
so they really work
well together.

12:18.710 --> 12:21.311
What temperature
were you aiming for?

12:21.346 --> 12:22.390
A little red in the middle.

12:22.414 --> 12:24.614
Let me see there...

12:24.650 --> 12:26.449
Nailed it, big-time.

12:29.655 --> 12:32.188
Mm, paté delicious.

12:32.224 --> 12:33.901
You've got the salt right,
the pepper right.

12:33.925 --> 12:35.392
Love that slaw.

12:35.427 --> 12:38.094
Those chips, delicious,
seasoning's nice.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.597
But the bun is just
a touch too soggy.

12:40.632 --> 12:42.098
Toast it a big longer next time.

12:42.134 --> 12:43.600
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

12:51.410 --> 12:52.842
Well, is it good or not?

12:52.878 --> 12:56.546
This is what eating's all about.

12:56.581 --> 12:58.481
The flavors, the seasoning,

12:58.517 --> 13:00.617
the cole slaw is explosive,

13:00.652 --> 13:01.851
and it helps moisten

13:01.887 --> 13:03.553
the venison and pork
that's in there.

13:03.588 --> 13:04.766
If I was gonna change anything,

13:04.790 --> 13:06.323
as far as the meat,

13:06.358 --> 13:08.158
I would love maybe
a little more pork.

13:08.193 --> 13:09.470
It's the only thing
that I would change,

13:09.494 --> 13:10.694
because that is delicious.

13:10.729 --> 13:12.529
- Good job, Avery.
- Thank you.

13:12.564 --> 13:15.565
[applause]

13:16.868 --> 13:17.868
Next up,

13:17.903 --> 13:20.303
this burger has a lot

13:20.339 --> 13:22.739
of sophisticated flavors,

13:22.774 --> 13:24.874
and it's made by someone

13:24.910 --> 13:28.411
who's cooking
way beyond their years.

13:28.447 --> 13:32.582
This dish belongs to...

13:32.617 --> 13:34.617
Zac.

13:34.653 --> 13:36.820
I'm an athlete,
and I'm very competitive.

13:36.855 --> 13:39.122
<i>So it's an amazing feeling
to be picked</i>

13:39.157 --> 13:41.591
<i>for the first mystery box
of the competition.</i>

13:41.626 --> 13:43.326
<i>And now everyone will know</i>

13:43.362 --> 13:45.528
<i>that I'm gonna bring my A-game
every time.</i>

13:45.564 --> 13:48.231
All right, Zac, how old are you?

13:48.266 --> 13:49.532
I'm 12 years old.

13:49.568 --> 13:50.845
And what do you do
when you're not

13:50.869 --> 13:52.246
spending time
in the kitchen cooking?

13:52.270 --> 13:53.670
Back home in Orlando,

13:53.705 --> 13:55.372
I like to play a lot of tennis.

13:55.407 --> 13:58.108
I'm ranked inside
the top juniors in the country.

13:58.143 --> 14:00.310
And I'm really confident
on the tennis court,

14:00.345 --> 14:02.579
and I try to bring that
into the kitchen.

14:02.614 --> 14:06.282
So, I'm so curious
about what's in this burger.

14:06.318 --> 14:09.352
The patty meat itself
is chuck and sirloin,

14:09.388 --> 14:11.354
and then I did
shitake mushrooms,

14:11.390 --> 14:13.890
butter lettuce,
cheddar cheese, and tomato,

14:13.925 --> 14:18.395
and then for the side,
some panko-crusted onion rings.

14:18.430 --> 14:21.765
I mean, look at that cook.

14:21.800 --> 14:26.403
This, for me, is like
a picture-perfect burger.

14:26.438 --> 14:30.440
I really love all of the
really juicy, shiny condiments.

14:30.475 --> 14:32.208
Thank you.

14:32.244 --> 14:34.155
I loved your decision
to make those onion rings thin

14:34.179 --> 14:35.289
and to coat them thinly
in panko.

14:35.313 --> 14:36.746
Yeah.

14:36.782 --> 14:38.526
But I'd love just
a little bit more seasoning,

14:38.550 --> 14:39.849
a little bit more of that zing.

14:39.885 --> 14:41.251
Yeah.

14:41.286 --> 14:42.463
But you did a really nice job.

14:42.487 --> 14:43.586
Thank you.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:53.131 --> 14:55.098
I love the fact
that you kept it classic.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.533
Delicious, season's nice.

14:56.568 --> 14:57.867
Cook on it is beautiful.

14:57.903 --> 14:59.836
Brioche, nice choice of bun.

14:59.871 --> 15:02.272
Onion rings could be
a little bit more crispy,

15:02.307 --> 15:03.584
so you just have to be
very careful there,

15:03.608 --> 15:05.208
because when you stack them
like that,

15:05.243 --> 15:06.854
they start sort of getting
a little bit soggy.

15:06.878 --> 15:08.211
Okay.

15:08.246 --> 15:09.546
By and large, great effort.

15:09.581 --> 15:10.658
I love the way
you cook with confidence.

15:10.682 --> 15:11.648
Yes.

15:11.683 --> 15:12.882
Great burger,

15:12.918 --> 15:14.162
and a great start
in this competition.

15:14.186 --> 15:15.385
Good job, thank you.

15:15.420 --> 15:16.453
Thank you.

15:16.488 --> 15:17.620
[applause]

15:17.656 --> 15:20.557
- Good job, Zac.
- Nice job, Avery.

15:20.592 --> 15:22.225
Last up,

15:22.260 --> 15:25.395
this home cook plated
their burger beautifully.

15:25.430 --> 15:28.598
They gave us a classic take
on the all-American burger,

15:28.633 --> 15:33.403
but elevated it to what appears
to be restaurant-quality.

15:33.438 --> 15:37.340
They also served
a delicious side.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.576
Please bring up your burger...

15:39.611 --> 15:43.313
[suspenseful music]

15:43.348 --> 15:44.348
Kya.

15:44.382 --> 15:46.149
[applause]

15:46.184 --> 15:50.086
Aw, man, I really wanted
to win this so bad.

15:50.121 --> 15:52.355
<i>But Kya's 8, so I think that</i>

15:52.390 --> 15:55.225
she's a great influence
for young home cooks.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.359
I feel so happy for her.

15:56.394 --> 15:58.194
- Okay, how we doing?
- Good.

15:58.230 --> 16:01.631
Now, tell me exactly
what we have in this burger.

16:01.666 --> 16:05.168
This is my wagyu burger...

16:05.203 --> 16:06.169
All right.

16:06.204 --> 16:07.370
With apple fries.

16:07.405 --> 16:09.739
I used wagyu beef for my burger,

16:09.774 --> 16:11.174
and a balsamic ketchup

16:11.209 --> 16:12.842
with medium cheddar
and provolone.

16:12.878 --> 16:14.844
You're using
some expensive ingredients,

16:14.880 --> 16:16.112
that wagyu beef.

16:16.147 --> 16:17.358
Yeah, I'm more into fine dining,

16:17.382 --> 16:19.916
but sometimes I like
to do rustic.

16:23.355 --> 16:24.821
Mm, that flavor's delicious.

16:24.856 --> 16:27.590
I mean, the acidity
that goes into that ketchup

16:27.626 --> 16:28.591
makes it balanced.

16:28.627 --> 16:29.893
Thank you.

16:29.928 --> 16:32.195
If anything,
the burger patty itself

16:32.230 --> 16:33.730
could be a little smaller.

16:33.765 --> 16:36.232
The apple fries,
really, really smart.

16:36.268 --> 16:37.545
I thought that they
were potato wedges

16:37.569 --> 16:39.302
when I first saw them.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.282
So this is showing me
you're thinking outside the box.

16:41.306 --> 16:44.274
- Great job.
- Thank you.

16:44.309 --> 16:46.442
Kya, where do these
ideas come from?

16:46.478 --> 16:47.844
You're 8 years of age.

16:47.879 --> 16:49.479
- I'm actually from Hong Kong.
- Mm-hmm?

16:49.514 --> 16:50.780
And when I was young,

16:50.815 --> 16:53.182
my dad would cook
wagyu beef burgers.

16:53.218 --> 16:55.585
Wow, so that was,
what, five years ago?

16:55.620 --> 16:57.520
- Yeah.
- Wow.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.292
That is delicious, young lady.

17:02.327 --> 17:04.627
Burger seasoned beautifully.

17:04.663 --> 17:07.763
The flavor combination
of two cheeses, delicious.

17:07.799 --> 17:09.198
What would I change?

17:09.233 --> 17:11.768
The apple needs
a bit more cooking.

17:11.803 --> 17:13.336
However, great job.

17:13.371 --> 17:14.637
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:14.673 --> 17:17.473
Wow.

17:17.509 --> 17:18.575
Great job, Kya.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.343
- Good job.
- Good job.

17:24.549 --> 17:26.214
Avery, Zac, Kya,

17:26.251 --> 17:28.685
three burgers that I would
put on my menu.

Oh, man, they're crazy,
those dogs, right?

26:07.999 --> 26:09.298
They're crazy cute.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.499
[laughs]

26:10.534 --> 26:12.434
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

26:21.512 --> 26:22.978
Ugh.

26:27.051 --> 26:28.851
Um...

26:31.088 --> 26:32.521
See what Kade just did?

26:32.556 --> 26:35.658
He totally burned
his marshmallows.

26:35.693 --> 26:36.870
A toasted marshmallow is great.

26:36.894 --> 26:38.071
But a burnt marshmallow
is bitter.

26:38.095 --> 26:39.361
It's not sweet at all.

26:39.397 --> 26:40.963
Ay-ay-ay.

26:40.998 --> 26:44.600
Um... should I blow on it?

26:44.635 --> 26:46.435
[blowing]

26:52.610 --> 26:53.876
Ugh.

26:56.714 --> 26:58.581
[sighing]

26:58.616 --> 27:00.316
The key to cooking
marshmallows is

27:00.351 --> 27:02.785
not too much heat
when you're blow-torching it.

27:02.820 --> 27:03.986
Otherwise, they'll burn,

27:04.022 --> 27:05.554
and nobody likes
a burnt marshmallow.

27:05.590 --> 27:06.656
Um...

27:06.691 --> 27:08.591
Should I blow on it?

27:08.626 --> 27:10.493
But those things look black.

27:10.528 --> 27:11.994
Oh, man.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.331
15 minutes to go!

27:15.366 --> 27:16.465
Come on, guys!

27:16.501 --> 27:18.601
You don't have a long time!

27:18.636 --> 27:20.269
I'm making apple crostata

27:20.305 --> 27:22.004
with a marshmallow
whipped cream,

27:22.040 --> 27:23.973
because I like to make
apple pies

27:24.008 --> 27:25.808
at my parents' restaurant.

27:25.843 --> 27:27.443
<i>I love marshmallows,</i>

27:27.478 --> 27:28.978
<i>but I don't like
cooking with them.</i>

27:29.013 --> 27:30.424
<i>Even though they're
delicate and sweet,</i>

27:30.448 --> 27:34.550
<i>they're still hard to cook.</i>

27:34.585 --> 27:36.919
In South Carolina,
we don't see a lot of snow.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.288
So seeing it, like,
snow marshmallows

27:39.324 --> 27:41.324
in the MasterChef kitchen
was pretty awesome.

27:41.359 --> 27:45.027
I'm making a raspberry
marshmallow whoopie pie,

27:45.063 --> 27:48.564
because my grandpa
taught me how to make it.

27:48.599 --> 27:49.832
[laughing]

27:49.867 --> 27:53.636
This is really challenging.

27:53.671 --> 27:54.671
Alexander, how you doing?

27:54.706 --> 27:55.706
I just have one problem.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.973
I accidentally added

27:57.008 --> 27:59.308
too much water
in my raspberry sauce.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.888
Yes, my man, you have got
too much water.

28:00.912 --> 28:01.877
Do you want some of that out?

28:01.913 --> 28:03.479
- Yes.
- Wow.

28:03.514 --> 28:04.847
What are you making for us?

28:04.882 --> 28:06.527
What are you doing,
like, a raspberry purée?

28:06.551 --> 28:07.817
I'm making a marshmallow pie

28:07.852 --> 28:09.986
with graham cracker
banana chip crust.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.587
- Can I ask a question?
- Yeah.

28:11.622 --> 28:12.822
Can I try that bandana on?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.090
That looks very cool, that.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.624
Yeah.
Where'd you get that from?

28:15.660 --> 28:16.993
- Japan.
- Have you been to Japan?

28:17.028 --> 28:17.994
Yes.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.362
Does that suit me?

28:19.397 --> 28:20.896
Do I look like
some karate kid now?

28:20.932 --> 28:22.298
Kind of.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.799
What's the perfect karate pose?

28:23.835 --> 28:24.800
Kah-jah!

28:24.836 --> 28:26.002
[stifled laughter]

28:26.037 --> 28:27.037
- Ooh.
- Ah-ah.

28:27.071 --> 28:28.337
Do you study karate?

28:28.373 --> 28:29.338
When I was little.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.439
Do you have a black belt?

28:30.475 --> 28:32.308
My highest was an orange belt.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.443
- Right, good luck.
- Thanks.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.379
Looking good, Alexander.

28:36.414 --> 28:39.515
Last five minutes, guys!

28:39.550 --> 28:41.484
Who are we expecting
to shine here?

28:41.519 --> 28:43.486
Got some pretty great
bakers in the crowd.

28:43.521 --> 28:46.422
I'm hoping Addison
whips up something great.

28:46.457 --> 28:48.624
This is the cupcake of my life.

28:48.659 --> 28:49.803
Jesse is looking
incredible as well.

28:49.827 --> 28:51.427
He's confident.

28:51.462 --> 28:52.773
I'm expecting fireworks
from him tonight.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.330
I think Sam, right?

28:54.365 --> 28:55.409
I mean, you're looking
at that mohawk,

28:55.433 --> 28:57.033
and I just think some crazy

28:57.068 --> 28:59.046
punk rock marshmallow thing
is coming out of that station.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.036
He looks like a technician.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.504
90 seconds to go.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.005
Start plating.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.642
Oh, my gosh.

29:09.514 --> 29:10.579
Ah, how do I do it?

29:10.615 --> 29:12.014
Oh, no.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.816
Alexander, it's got
to be on the plate.

29:13.851 --> 29:15.017
Oh!

29:15.053 --> 29:16.519
Hurry, grab a plate
from the kitchen.

29:16.554 --> 29:17.520
Run as fast as you can!

29:17.555 --> 29:18.621
Go!

29:18.656 --> 29:19.889
30 seconds.
Come on, guys!

29:19.924 --> 29:21.624
I'm so worried about Alexander.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.559
15 seconds to go!

29:23.594 --> 29:25.895
[suspenseful music]

29:25.930 --> 29:28.697
He's got to take that
out of the ring mold.

29:28.733 --> 29:32.768
Nine, eight, seven, six...

29:32.804 --> 29:37.440
five, four, three, two, one.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.475
And stop, hands in the air!

29:39.510 --> 29:40.609
[cheers and applause]

29:40.645 --> 29:41.844
Well done.

29:41.879 --> 29:43.045
Good job, guys!

29:43.081 --> 29:46.449
Whoo, yeah!

29:46.484 --> 29:49.085
Right, let's start with Addison.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.020
Let's go, please.

29:51.055 --> 29:53.589
I'm really hoping the judges
like my cupcake,

29:53.624 --> 29:55.658
'cause I want to open up
a bakery

29:55.693 --> 29:57.460
called Batter Up Bakery.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.463
<i>It would combine my love
for baking and softball.</i>

30:00.498 --> 30:02.031
<i>If the judges like my cupcake,</i>

30:02.066 --> 30:04.600
it's definitely
going in my bakery.

30:04.635 --> 30:06.135
Look at that beauty.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.137
Describe your cupcake, please.

30:08.172 --> 30:10.039
I made a chocolate cupcake

30:10.074 --> 30:13.609
with a chocolate cereal
and marshmallow filling.

30:13.644 --> 30:15.411
On top, a chocolate ganache

30:15.446 --> 30:18.047
with roasted marshmallows
and an edible flower.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.048
Wow.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.382
You're how old?

30:20.418 --> 30:21.750
- Nine.
- Amazing.

30:21.786 --> 30:24.587
Now, how long did you
cook the cupcake?

30:24.622 --> 30:27.423
I cooked the cupcake
for about 25 minutes.

30:27.458 --> 30:28.958
Why edible flowers?

30:28.993 --> 30:32.461
Because I love color,
and they taste good.

30:32.497 --> 30:36.532
Wow, look at that.

30:36.567 --> 30:37.533
It's gooey.

30:37.568 --> 30:39.435
It's rich, moist.

30:39.470 --> 30:40.848
Is that what you're
looking for in the center?

30:40.872 --> 30:41.837
Mm-hmm.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.639
Incredible.

30:43.674 --> 30:45.341
Mm.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.542
Have you tasted this yet?

30:46.577 --> 30:47.610
No.

30:47.645 --> 30:48.677
Thank you.

30:48.713 --> 30:51.413
That is too good to waste.

30:51.449 --> 30:52.615
That's really good.

30:52.650 --> 30:53.949
[laughter]

30:53.985 --> 30:55.518
It's very chocolatey
in the center.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.820
Love the marshmallow
wrapped up in the ganache.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.088
And it doesn't need this.

30:59.123 --> 31:00.689
Okay, that was
just for decoration.

31:00.725 --> 31:01.935
This should go,
yeah, in your hair.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.526
Oh, no!

31:03.561 --> 31:05.561
Come on, that's where
you put the flowers.

31:05.596 --> 31:07.696
I thought, up until tonight,

31:07.732 --> 31:10.466
That Christina was
the best baker in this country.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.769
Well, Christina,
somebody is chasing your job.

31:13.804 --> 31:15.437
Great start.

31:15.473 --> 31:16.572
Great finesse.

31:16.607 --> 31:17.673
Well done, thank you.

31:17.708 --> 31:20.709
Thank you.

31:20.745 --> 31:23.879
Next up, Sam.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.514
Back home in South Carolina,

31:25.550 --> 31:27.483
I mostly cook; I don't bake.

31:27.997 --> 31:29.986
<i>But I think I did
a really good job,</i>

31:30.021 --> 31:33.756
and I'm really confident
in myself with what I've done.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.958
Dang, look at that.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.093
Oh, yeah, seriously.

31:37.128 --> 31:39.362
Those are beautiful.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.363
Wow.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.475
Now, is this a whoopie pie?

31:41.499 --> 31:43.032
Yes, it is whoopie pie.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.369
I stuffed them with
a raspberry marshmallow cream

31:46.404 --> 31:49.171
and a chocolate cookie batter.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.384
What's the best way to eat this?

31:50.408 --> 31:51.941
Just pick it up like a gigantic

31:51.976 --> 31:53.476
marshmallow chocolate burger?

31:53.511 --> 31:54.810
Yeah.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.348
Whoopie.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.484
It's, like,
out-of-control good.

32:01.519 --> 32:04.120
It has got an amazing
contrast going on

32:04.155 --> 32:07.256
between this nice,
fluffy marshmallow

32:07.291 --> 32:08.557
flavored with that raspberry,

32:08.593 --> 32:10.359
and then the actual chocolate.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.561
So, well-plated,
well-designed.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.863
This is a home run.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.498
- Good job, Sam.
- Thanks.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.366
[applause]

32:17.402 --> 32:18.801
High five.

32:18.836 --> 32:21.871
Next up, I'm excited to try

32:21.906 --> 32:23.906
the marshmallow dish
of Alexander.

32:23.941 --> 32:24.974
[whimpers]

32:25.009 --> 32:26.308
[applause]

32:26.344 --> 32:27.877
<i>I feel horrible right now,</i>

32:27.912 --> 32:30.179
because I have
the worst presentation

32:30.214 --> 32:32.281
in all the 24 cooks.

32:32.316 --> 32:35.151
<i>I hope the judges can see
past my mistake,</i>

32:35.186 --> 32:38.054
'cause I really don't want
to go home to Phoenix.

32:40.825 --> 32:42.258
Hi, Alexander.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.325
Ugh.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.493
What happened?

32:44.529 --> 32:47.196
My plating looks horrible.

32:58.865 --> 32:59.662
Ugh.

32:59.742 --> 33:00.680
What happened?

33:00.760 --> 33:03.122
My plating looks horrible.

33:03.837 --> 33:05.937
I think you should
love your dessert

33:05.972 --> 33:10.141
as much as I think
I'm gonna love your dessert.

33:10.176 --> 33:11.676
So let's do this again.

33:11.711 --> 33:12.743
All right, here we go.

33:12.779 --> 33:13.779
What do we have?

33:13.813 --> 33:15.780
A marshmallow pie

33:15.815 --> 33:18.749
with a banana
and graham cracker crust

33:18.785 --> 33:21.219
with marshmallow
and cherry filling,

33:21.254 --> 33:24.856
and on top,
torch-flamed marshmallows.

33:24.891 --> 33:26.257
Well, let's taste it.

33:26.292 --> 33:28.826
Look at those marshmallows.

33:32.165 --> 33:35.099
The filling really does
have the flavor

33:35.134 --> 33:36.312
and the texture
of a marshmallow,

33:36.336 --> 33:38.870
so it is aptly named
marshmallow pie.

33:38.905 --> 33:41.172
The marshmallow is
really nice to balance

33:41.207 --> 33:43.641
the acidity of the chocolate.

33:43.676 --> 33:45.543
Presentation isn't as great

33:45.578 --> 33:47.678
as I know you would have liked,

33:47.714 --> 33:49.046
but overall, you definitely

33:49.082 --> 33:50.681
celebrated marshmallows
in this dish,

33:50.717 --> 33:52.194
which was the whole purpose
of the challenge.

33:52.218 --> 33:53.218
Well done.

33:53.253 --> 33:54.919
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

33:54.954 --> 33:57.788
Alexander looks really upset.

33:57.824 --> 33:58.990
It's hard to stay positive

33:59.025 --> 34:00.658
when something
like that happens.

34:00.693 --> 34:02.960
But it's not all
about the looks.

34:02.996 --> 34:06.063
<i>It's also about the taste.</i>

34:06.099 --> 34:07.899
Next up, Kade, please.

34:07.934 --> 34:09.533
Let's go.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.101
I'm scared right now,

34:11.137 --> 34:12.870
<i>'cause my marshmallows
look a little crispy,</i>

34:12.906 --> 34:15.706
<i>and my presentation
isn't the best.</i>

34:15.742 --> 34:18.809
<i>So I really hope
that creativity and taste</i>

34:18.844 --> 34:20.878
<i>will help me a lot right now.</i>

34:20.914 --> 34:22.612
Right, Kade.

34:22.649 --> 34:24.649
Describe the dish, please, bud.

34:24.684 --> 34:27.752
A banana split
with a sweet potato biscuit

34:27.786 --> 34:29.654
and a marshmallow gravy

34:29.688 --> 34:31.255
with toasted marshmallows.

34:31.291 --> 34:33.623
'Cause who doesn't love
toasted marshmallows?

34:33.659 --> 34:34.969
Did you toast them
a little bit too long?

34:34.994 --> 34:36.793
Because they look cremated.

34:36.829 --> 34:39.297
Um, I started
blow-torching them,

34:39.331 --> 34:40.630
and they caught fire,

34:40.667 --> 34:42.132
and I didn't know what to do.

34:42.168 --> 34:43.801
You had plenty of time.

34:43.835 --> 34:46.036
So why didn't you
start it again?

34:46.072 --> 34:49.873
Um...

34:49.909 --> 34:51.175
Right.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.547
Mm, what's this bit here?

34:56.581 --> 34:59.216
That was semi-sweet
chocolate.

34:59.252 --> 35:01.018
It almost caught fire,

35:01.054 --> 35:03.688
- with the blowtorch.
- Oh, wow.

35:03.723 --> 35:05.222
Your sweet potato biscuit

35:05.258 --> 35:07.591
actually tastes nice,
not too bad.

35:07.627 --> 35:10.261
But, unfortunately,
the chocolate is burnt,

35:10.296 --> 35:12.663
the marshmallows are burnt.

35:12.699 --> 35:13.898
However, strong effort.

35:13.933 --> 35:15.499
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:15.535 --> 35:17.535
[applause]

35:17.570 --> 35:20.538
Next up, Jesse.

35:20.573 --> 35:21.939
I'm a little nervous,

35:21.975 --> 35:23.841
<i>because I'm not
the greatest baker.</i>

35:23.876 --> 35:25.843
We don't really bake
in my house.

35:25.878 --> 35:27.912
<i>So if Christina likes my dish,</i>

35:27.947 --> 35:29.714
this will be so big for me.

35:29.749 --> 35:30.749
So where are you from?

35:30.783 --> 35:31.783
New York.

35:31.818 --> 35:33.150
I live in Brooklyn.

35:33.186 --> 35:34.852
- Oh.
- We're practically neighbors.

35:34.887 --> 35:36.721
So, what'd you make
with those marshmallows?

35:36.756 --> 35:39.290
I made toasted
marshmallow churros

35:39.325 --> 35:41.892
and a toasted marshmallow
whipped cream.

35:46.099 --> 35:47.631
- Jesse.
- Yeah?

35:47.667 --> 35:48.632
These are amazing.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.101
Thanks.

35:50.136 --> 35:52.269
It's perfectly golden-brown
on the outside

35:52.305 --> 35:54.238
and doughy in the center.

35:54.273 --> 35:57.675
We are definitely soul mates
on what a great dessert is.

35:57.710 --> 35:59.518
Corey, please, let's go.

35:59.737 --> 36:02.137
Describe this
marshmallow dessert.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.840
It's a peach and banana cake

36:04.875 --> 36:07.209
topped off with
candied raspberries

36:07.244 --> 36:09.344
and a side of roasted
marshmallows

36:09.380 --> 36:11.346
with a raspberry-strawberry
sauce.

36:11.382 --> 36:13.248
Wow, so why peach?

36:13.284 --> 36:15.183
My dad's from the Caribbean,

36:15.219 --> 36:19.588
so he used a lot of fruits,
like peaches.

36:19.623 --> 36:21.056
It tastes nice,

36:21.091 --> 36:22.524
but you want more
of the marshmallow

36:22.560 --> 36:24.793
inside that layers of cake.

36:24.828 --> 36:26.528
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:26.564 --> 36:28.063
Next up, please.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.331
- Mia.
- Oh, god.

36:29.366 --> 36:32.167
I wasn't expecting that.

36:32.202 --> 36:33.602
Mia, what did you make
for "me-uh"?

36:33.637 --> 36:36.738
I made a marshmallow biscuit

36:36.774 --> 36:38.407
with a marshmallow butter

36:38.442 --> 36:40.642
and a raspberry gastrique sauce.

36:40.678 --> 36:42.578
What's in the center here?

36:42.613 --> 36:44.446
Marshmallow fluff
whipped with butter,

36:44.481 --> 36:45.647
and then powdered sugar.

36:45.683 --> 36:46.748
I like the colors.

36:46.784 --> 36:49.351
Thank you.

36:49.386 --> 36:50.352
Wow.

36:50.387 --> 36:51.520
Yay, that's good.

36:51.555 --> 36:52.688
That's really good.
Cool!

36:52.723 --> 36:54.222
Yeah, to put
marshmallow through it,

36:54.258 --> 36:55.624
and then make this sweet butter.

36:55.659 --> 36:56.659
I mean, this is simple,

36:56.694 --> 36:58.360
but done in a great way.

36:58.395 --> 36:59.428
Aw, so nice.

36:59.463 --> 37:01.697
- Good job.
- Thank you.

37:01.732 --> 37:02.698
Yay.

37:02.733 --> 37:04.266
I'm happy.

37:04.301 --> 37:05.667
Last up, Ian, please.

37:05.703 --> 37:07.169
Let's go.

37:07.204 --> 37:09.538
I had some mess-ups
in the kitchen.

37:09.573 --> 37:12.240
<i>But I have a very
sophisticated palate.</i>

37:12.276 --> 37:14.042
<i>So I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna pull this off.</i>

37:14.078 --> 37:16.645
I swear to God,
I'm gonna pull this off.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.646
Okay.

37:17.681 --> 37:18.721
Describe the dish, please.

37:18.749 --> 37:20.382
So it's an apple crostata

37:20.417 --> 37:23.251
served with...
well, with burnt marshmallows.

37:23.287 --> 37:24.453
Oh, I see.

37:24.488 --> 37:26.121
My whipped cream turned out bad.

37:26.156 --> 37:27.756
It turned into,
like, vomit, so...

37:27.791 --> 37:29.291
Your whipped cream
turned into vomit.

37:29.326 --> 37:31.093
Yeah, it...

37:31.128 --> 37:32.572
That's a great way
of selling the dish, Chef Ian.

37:32.596 --> 37:34.029
It looked like it.

37:34.064 --> 37:35.230
I'm glad you didn't serve it.

37:35.265 --> 37:36.409
- Smart move, trust me.
- Thank you.

37:36.433 --> 37:38.133
Any of the marshmallows,

37:38.168 --> 37:39.446
rather than just those ones
that you've toasted

37:39.470 --> 37:40.714
'round the outside of the plate?

37:40.738 --> 37:42.082
No, those are
the only marshmallows.

37:42.106 --> 37:43.472
Right.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.431
First of all, actually tastes
quite nice altogether.

37:49.455 --> 37:50.992
The apples taste delicious.

37:51.072 --> 37:51.791
Thank you.

37:51.824 --> 37:53.163
But it needs more time in the oven.
Okay.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.187
The pastry's too thick.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.055
If you're running out of time,

37:55.090 --> 37:56.687
the thinner it is,
the quicker it cooks.

37:56.723 --> 37:57.378
Okay.

37:57.458 --> 38:00.566
So I think the time
tonight got the better of you.

38:01.106 --> 38:02.972
Thank you.

38:03.008 --> 38:05.275
<i>I am really terrified.</i>

38:05.310 --> 38:07.110
<i>Someone's going home tonight,</i>

38:07.145 --> 38:09.090
and I don't think I'm gonna be
going to the next round

38:09.114 --> 38:10.280
in this competition.

38:10.315 --> 38:13.550
I think I'm going home.

38:16.159 --> 38:17.703
(Gordon) Well done. What
an amazing challenge.

38:17.727 --> 38:21.362
And this is
the toughest cooking competition

38:21.398 --> 38:22.964
you'll find anywhere
in the world.

38:22.999 --> 38:26.267
And now that means
we do have to say good-bye

38:26.303 --> 38:28.736
to some of you tonight.

38:28.772 --> 38:30.705
Right now, Christina,
Graham, and I

38:30.740 --> 38:32.974
need a very serious chat.

38:33.009 --> 38:35.076
Please excuse us.

38:38.348 --> 38:40.215
Wow, difficult, you know,

38:40.250 --> 38:42.016
'cause there's
so many good ones.

38:42.052 --> 38:44.285
I mean, that's a lot
of great technical ability.

38:44.321 --> 38:46.120
You're not gonna get eliminated.

38:46.156 --> 38:47.255
I really hope not.

38:47.290 --> 38:48.723
They liked it.

38:48.758 --> 38:50.358
There were some downsides.

38:50.393 --> 38:54.095
Alexander's marshmallow pie
just didn't work.

38:54.130 --> 38:55.797
He knew it didn't work.

38:55.832 --> 38:57.765
You made a little mistake
with the presentation,

38:57.801 --> 38:59.234
but that's okay.

38:59.269 --> 39:00.846
Ian, I mean,
I know he's the youngest boy,

39:00.870 --> 39:03.771
but that crostata
was undercooked.

39:03.807 --> 39:04.906
Oh, my God.

39:04.941 --> 39:05.907
Kade...

39:05.942 --> 39:07.108
Marshmallows burned.

39:07.143 --> 39:08.454
He obviously,
clearly burned them,

39:08.478 --> 39:09.956
and they could have
started that again,

39:09.980 --> 39:11.357
but banana
bizarrely put on the plate.

39:11.381 --> 39:12.847
It didn't make any sense at all.

39:12.882 --> 39:14.060
I'm so nervous right now, dude.

39:14.084 --> 39:15.049
Me too.

39:15.085 --> 39:16.251
- Happy?
- I think so.

39:16.286 --> 39:17.252
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:17.287 --> 39:18.253
They're coming.

39:18.288 --> 39:19.354
[gasps]

39:22.259 --> 39:25.226
You all made us
so proud tonight,

39:25.262 --> 39:29.964
but we do have to say good-bye
to some of you this evening.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.799
If I call your name,

39:31.835 --> 39:34.035
I'd like for you to come down
and stand in the front.

39:34.070 --> 39:36.337
Will the following
six home cooks

39:36.373 --> 39:38.006
please come and line up?

39:38.041 --> 39:39.307
Jesse...

39:39.342 --> 39:41.376
Alexander...

39:41.411 --> 39:42.944
Addison...

39:42.979 --> 39:44.479
Ian...

39:44.514 --> 39:46.414
Kade...

39:46.449 --> 39:48.883
Last up, Sam.

39:51.454 --> 39:54.188
Now, please step forward.

39:54.224 --> 39:56.391
Addison...

39:56.426 --> 39:58.760
Sam...

39:58.795 --> 40:00.995
Jesse.

40:01.031 --> 40:03.231
Tonight you three home cooks,

40:03.266 --> 40:07.168
age 11, 9, and 10,

40:07.203 --> 40:09.404
you made the best
three dishes of the night.

40:09.439 --> 40:11.839
Congratulations, well done.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.041
Oh, great job.

40:13.076 --> 40:14.442
Head back
to your station, please.

40:14.477 --> 40:18.680
Well done, thank you.

40:18.715 --> 40:21.049
Alexander, Ian, and Kade,

40:21.084 --> 40:25.853
you three just fell short
of everyone else.

40:25.889 --> 40:28.389
Ian, would you please
step forward?

40:28.425 --> 40:31.893
[whispering]
Oh, my God.

40:31.928 --> 40:35.797
Ian, we know you were
frustrated tonight,

40:35.832 --> 40:39.834
but you did just enough
to squeak through.

40:39.869 --> 40:41.002
Oh, my God.

40:41.037 --> 40:42.937
Please head back
to your station.

40:42.972 --> 40:45.773
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

40:45.809 --> 40:46.874
That's amazing, great job.

40:46.910 --> 40:47.875
Thank you.
Thank you.

40:47.911 --> 40:50.044
Oh, my God.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.214
[somber music]

40:53.249 --> 40:56.250
Sadly, that means,
Alexander and Kade,

40:56.286 --> 41:01.155
unfortunately you both
are heading home tonight.

41:01.191 --> 41:02.757
But keep your head up high,

41:02.792 --> 41:04.303
and you must remember
what you've achieved

41:04.327 --> 41:06.794
so far in this competition.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.374
Promise me you're gonna
continue cooking.

41:08.398 --> 41:10.365
- I will.
- Yes, Chef.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.767
You've been incredible.

41:12.802 --> 41:15.770
Thank you.

41:15.805 --> 41:18.373
Even though I didn't win
the MasterChef Junior trophy,

41:18.408 --> 41:19.941
I feel pretty good,

41:19.976 --> 41:22.176
because I'm going home,
back to Louisiana.

41:22.212 --> 41:24.178
- Group hug, everybody.
- Group hug.

41:24.214 --> 41:25.291
Come on, you guys did awesome.

41:25.315 --> 41:26.914
You guys did great.

41:26.950 --> 41:28.260
And I think I'll have
these friends

41:28.284 --> 41:30.785
<i>for a very long time,</i>

41:30.820 --> 41:33.688
until I'm about 50.

41:33.723 --> 41:35.323
You did really well, Alexander.

41:35.358 --> 41:36.958
<i>Even though I'm going
home to Phoenix,</i>

41:36.993 --> 41:38.893
<i>I'm proud of myself,</i>

41:38.928 --> 41:42.864
because I'm one of the top 24
best home cooks in America.

41:42.899 --> 41:45.299
(all)
Bye!

41:45.335 --> 41:47.935
<i>And almost a million people
have never even got this apron,</i>

41:47.971 --> 41:51.406
so I'll have bragging rights
in the schoolyard.

41:51.441 --> 41:52.907
Bye, guys, we love ya!

41:52.942 --> 41:54.108
Bye!

41:54.144 --> 41:55.877
Never stop cooking!

42:00.216 --> 42:01.315
(narrator)
<i>Next week...</i>

42:01.351 --> 42:02.383
You can do it!

42:02.419 --> 42:04.819
(all)
Top that cupcake!

42:04.854 --> 42:07.789
<i>(narrator) The remaining young home
cooks are in for a sweet treat.</i>

42:07.824 --> 42:09.924
Come on, come on, come on.

42:09.959 --> 42:11.826
<i>(narrator)
And the judges find themselves</i>

42:11.861 --> 42:14.095
<i>in a sticky situation.</i>

42:14.130 --> 42:15.930
Take off the shoes first.

42:15.965 --> 42:17.398
<i>(narrator)
Then, Gordon Ramsay</i>

42:17.434 --> 42:19.967
<i>breaks open a tough
scallop challenge...</i>

42:20.003 --> 42:21.769
It's scientifically impossible.

42:21.805 --> 42:23.738
Why can't I get this open?

42:23.773 --> 42:24.739
<i>(narrator) Which brings
some talented home cooks</i>

42:24.774 --> 42:27.208
<i>out of their shell.</i>

42:27.243 --> 42:28.743
I've got a funny feeling

42:28.778 --> 42:30.878
you're gonna be around
a long time.
