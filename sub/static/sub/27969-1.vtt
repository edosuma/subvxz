she belongs to you.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.776

You got a taste of what
your mom does for a living.

That was so much fun.
She was so happy.

the next one, too?

07:35.193 --> 07:36.586
We should do
the puppy thing again.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
Yes, but you're
gonna go camping

Remember?

07:39.981 --> 07:42.374
Can I bail on that
please?

07:42.418 --> 07:43.811
You like camping.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.813
It's fine when it's just
me and dad,

07:45.856 --> 07:47.336
but when he
brings Zoe along,

07:47.379 --> 07:49.207
they're always kissing,
and hugging,

07:49.251 --> 07:50.078
and Zoe's always trying to be my best friend.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.775
It-- It's annoying.

Come on,
your dad's been single for a long time.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.562

happy for him.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.520
Besides,
there are worse things

07:57.564 --> 07:59.174
than someone
trying to be nice to you.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.219
Why does he always
have to bring Zoe along?

08:01.263 --> 08:03.613
Why can't it just be
me and him once in a while?

08:03.657 --> 08:05.441
I don't know.
When you have a moment alone with your father,

08:05.485 --> 08:06.703
why don't you ask him that.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.531

a moment alone.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.407
Marissa's favorite holiday

Christmas tree,

19:22.987 --> 19:26.339
What is wrong with me?

Nothing.

you went through

their life with you,

19:45.793 --> 19:50.232

that was Marissa,

19:52.582 --> 19:55.150

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
The right one
will come along.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.637
So, am I the first client
who has been turned down

20:03.680 --> 20:05.639
during his proposal?

20:05.682 --> 20:07.380
No.

20:07.423 --> 20:10.383
Not every proposal
ends with a yes.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.775
You're not alone.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.734
Well, thank you for
saying that anyway.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.478
Listen, um,
I'm gonna go ahead

20:18.521 --> 20:19.740

back to your card.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.264

20:22.308 --> 20:23.874
First of all,
the money's no object,

20:23.918 --> 20:25.789
but secondly,
you went through all of this trouble,

20:25.833 --> 20:29.228
which, by the way,
this all looks beautiful.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.142
I just want you to know

20:31.186 --> 20:33.188

tonight.

21:09.355 --> 21:13.272
Eh. It's not like I'm
a stranger to rejection.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.012
I find that
hard to believe.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.884
Yeah,
you're probably right.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.016

cheating on him

21:38.384 --> 21:40.908
I felt so bad
for him.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.257
That's brutal.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.389
Well, it's better to
find out now

21:43.432 --> 21:44.564
rather than later,
though.

21:44.607 --> 21:47.088
That's exactly
what I told him.

they took anything

26:07.870 --> 26:09.045
from Ayla's bedroom,
either.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.482
We shouldn't touch
anything else.

26:11.526 --> 26:12.353
I'm calling
the police.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.187
I'm gonna need you guys

26:20.230 --> 26:23.320

We can do that.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.197
It doesn't take them long
to rob places,

26:30.240 --> 26:31.764
I mean, ten minutes,
they're in and out.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.723
We couldn't have been gone
more than an hour or two.

26:34.767 --> 26:37.030
But they didn't take
my jewelry. Nothing.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.598
I have a lot of very expensive
family heirlooms up there.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.425

lucky, then.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.826
Could have been
a lot worse.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.133
I'll let the guys finish
taking prints upstairs,

26:53.176 --> 26:55.526
and then I'll get you a copy of the police report for your insurance

26:55.570 --> 26:56.789
as soon as we
have it available.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.008
Thanks.

26:59.052 --> 27:02.316
You should know, though,
that once a house has been robbed,

27:02.359 --> 27:05.232
the chances of it being robbed again generally goes up.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.016
You know, these idiots,

27:07.060 --> 27:09.628
they talk to each other,
share information.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.239
What do you
suggest we do?

27:12.282 --> 27:13.762
Well, first of all,

27:13.806 --> 27:15.546
I mean, a house this big
and this nice,

27:15.590 --> 27:18.245
you definitely need to get
an alarm system.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.855
But, to be honest,

27:19.899 --> 27:22.423
the best deterrent
that you can get...

27:22.466 --> 27:23.511
a dog.

27:25.078 --> 27:25.905
Be in touch.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.125
Thank you.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.305
Guess we're
getting a dog.

27:36.785 --> 27:37.743
I guess so.

27:37.786 --> 27:38.787
So helpful.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.277
Hey, let's get
these reports done

27:50.320 --> 27:52.018

for these folks.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.063
Uh, they're
nice people.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.717
- Yeah.
- And let's put a BOLO out as well.

27:55.761 --> 27:56.805
Copy that.

27:59.112 --> 27:59.939
Good work.

28:12.473 --> 28:15.694
That's got to be at least 80 grand worth of equipment gone.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.607
Unreal.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.700
Well, you're insured.
We'll replace it.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.965
Did you get a chance to
upload the puppy proposal?

28:27.967 --> 28:30.056
I backed it up
onto a hard drive,

28:30.099 --> 28:31.448
but they got that, too.

28:31.492 --> 28:32.798
Oh, no.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.542
Jake and Theresa
are gonna be devastated.

28:38.586 --> 28:42.155
I think he's right.
We need to up the security.

28:42.198 --> 28:45.854
Well, Ayla's been
asking for a dog anyway.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.030
I still don't like
the idea of the two of you

28:48.074 --> 28:49.771
being here home alone.

28:49.815 --> 28:52.992
I've never been scared
in my own house before.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.777
Maybe you should move in.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.083
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.828
Okay, first thing
we're gonna do,

29:02.871 --> 29:04.394
we're gonna fix
that back door.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.222
And then we are
going shopping.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.963
We'll start replacing
all that equipment they took.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.051
Okay.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.052
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.536
We met at one of
the trade shows and, uh,

29:15.579 --> 29:18.800
we just connected.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.149
I didn't mean to hurt you.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.419
I've been seeing someone else.

29:29.463 --> 29:30.638
For the past
three or four months.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.295
I'm sorry.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.819
I've been seeing
someone else.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.300
For the past
three or four months.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.825
I'm sorry.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.087
I've been seeing
someone else.

29:46.610 --> 29:47.829
I've been seeing
someone else.

29:49.309 --> 29:50.658
I've been seeing
someone else.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.051
I've been seeing
someone else.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.926
It's a good lock, yeah?

29:57.970 --> 29:58.840
Yeah.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.843
Great.

30:01.887 --> 30:02.757
Thank you.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.935
So you lost
all the footage.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.981
Everything.
I mean everything.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.200
So, Paula,
I was kind of hoping

30:11.244 --> 30:13.246
that maybe you can call
some of your customers

30:13.289 --> 30:15.639
to see if they recorded
some of the footage

30:15.683 --> 30:16.858
on their cell phone.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.425
I really hate
having to tell them

30:18.468 --> 30:19.774
that all of their
footage was lost.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.863
I am so sorry.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.169
You know
what I can do?

30:23.212 --> 30:24.823
I can pull up
the reservations

30:24.866 --> 30:26.215
and call everyone
who was there that day.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.390
We take
their phone number

30:27.434 --> 30:28.522
when they make
a reservation.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.306
Oh. That would be...

30:30.350 --> 30:31.699
wonderful.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.657
It's not a problem,
Carmen.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.616
All right. I'm on it.
I'll talk to you later.

30:35.659 --> 30:36.704
All right. Bye-bye.

31:06.212 --> 31:08.736
A 9-year-old metro girl
has a new lease on life,

31:08.779 --> 31:11.086
thanks to surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.914
Tracy Hooper was--

31:12.958 --> 31:14.611
...the liver of a 9-year-old accident victim--

31:14.655 --> 31:15.830
What was that?

32:11.146 --> 32:12.626
Hello, Marissa.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.759
We need to talk.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.481
Yes,
they recorded it all,

33:25.525 --> 33:28.006
and they said that they
could give you the recording.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.964
That is wonderful news,
Paula.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.096
Thank you so much.

33:31.139 --> 33:32.358
Okay. Bye-bye.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.229
That was Paula
from The Steakhouse.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.752
She found someone
that recorded

33:35.796 --> 33:37.493
almost
the entire proposal.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.278
She says she was going
to email it to me later.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.714
Gosh, that is great.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.411
- Yes.
- Ahh.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.456
I got it.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.293
Someone sent you roses?

33:56.164 --> 33:58.384
"Carmen, thank you
for your kindness

33:58.427 --> 33:59.994
on such a tough day.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.779
With much appreciation,
Emerson."

34:02.823 --> 34:05.782
Poor guy. I was
just trying to be nice.

34:05.826 --> 34:07.610
He didn't have to send me
flowers for it.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.223
You're a good person.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.050
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.313
Anyway--

34:14.356 --> 34:15.487
Oh, my gosh.

34:15.531 --> 34:16.489
You get it?

34:16.532 --> 34:17.402
Yep.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.714
Mm.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.022
How did he know my address?

34:32.460 --> 34:34.942
Carmen, tell me, how did you manage to find

34:34.985 --> 34:39.251
such an amazing, handsome, intelligent boyfriend?

34:39.293 --> 34:41.556
Oh, well, I find

34:41.601 --> 34:44.690
that men tend
to respond well to this.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.742
I can see how that would work.

34:54.918 --> 34:58.444
Tell me, how did you meet this guy Ryan?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.359
I hired him a year
and a half ago

35:00.402 --> 35:02.404
to run the post side
of my company.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.155
You deserve
to be with someone

35:14.199 --> 35:17.245
who's excited to spend the rest of their life with you.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.390
Where is she?

35:38.484 --> 35:39.572
Hey, can't
get to the phone.

35:39.615 --> 35:40.747
You know what to do.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.183
Hey, sis, it's me.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.011
We had plans to run
together this morning.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.579
Did you forget? Call me
when you get this, okay?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.605
You're welcome.

36:56.649 --> 36:58.520
I also have
something else for you.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.522
That is a gift card
to The Steakhouse.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.046
The next time you and Theresa
go there is on me,

37:03.090 --> 37:05.266
and again I'm so sorry
that this happened.

37:05.310 --> 37:08.008
You really didn't have
to do all that

37:08.051 --> 37:11.751
I mean, you created
the most amazing proposal.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.362
It was the best day
of my life, honestly.

37:14.406 --> 37:17.496
And that puppy?
I mean--

37:17.539 --> 37:19.846
I'm just so sorry
your stuff got stolen.

37:19.889 --> 37:22.065
I know, but the police
is looking for it.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.545
Hopefully
they'll recover it,

37:23.589 --> 37:24.938
and if they do, you'll
be the first to know.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.331
Thank you.

37:26.374 --> 37:29.116
And I left a great
review for you online.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.466
If you haven't read it yet,
you should go read it.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.685
Thank you.

37:32.728 --> 37:33.816
Thank you.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.340
- Oh.
- I'll let you get that.

37:35.383 --> 37:36.558
Okay.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.212
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.648
Hello.

37:39.692 --> 37:42.825
Carmen, it's Emerson.

37:42.869 --> 37:46.307
Oh, hey, Emerson, hi.
How are you?

37:46.351 --> 37:48.135
I'm better.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.485
Much better.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.270
I just wanted to make sure
you'd received those flowers

37:52.313 --> 37:53.445
that I'd sent.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.230
I did. Thank you.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.319
Had you not been there
when Marissa...

38:00.103 --> 38:01.496
shared her news with me,

38:01.540 --> 38:03.498
I would have, uh...

38:05.761 --> 38:08.373
well, you know.
You were there.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.680
Well, I'm glad I could help.

38:11.724 --> 38:14.117
You'll have to remember me
for your next proposal.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.206
Oh, you--
you can bet on that.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.604
Carmen, I'd like to
take you out for coffee.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.390
Oh. Uh...

38:27.348 --> 38:29.350
I'm about to go on a trip
with my boyfriend,

38:29.394 --> 38:30.960
so maybe we can
touch base after that.

38:31.004 --> 38:34.007
Sure. Yeah. I can call you.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.095
How long will you be gone for?

38:35.138 --> 38:36.488
Two weeks.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.492
Are you going somewhere fun?

38:40.535 --> 38:42.232
You know, it's really important

38:42.276 --> 38:44.017
to take some time for yourself,

38:44.060 --> 38:46.628
so, um, listen,
I have another call coming in.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.414
Can we talk later?

38:49.457 --> 38:51.241
Sure. Yes. I just--

38:51.285 --> 38:53.026
I'll-- I'll call you
when you're back.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.816
You just have
to be honest with him,

39:00.860 --> 39:02.340
tell him
you're not interested.

39:02.383 --> 39:03.993
And reject him
a second time?

39:04.037 --> 39:06.387
I couldn't do that.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.868
Just because you refunded
this guy's money

39:08.911 --> 39:11.653
doesn't mean you
have to be besties.

39:11.697 --> 39:13.394
It's bae now.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.005
I'm serious.

39:16.049 --> 39:17.659
He caught me off guard.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.444
I didn't know
what to do or say.

39:19.487 --> 39:21.402
Honesty is the best policy.

39:22.664 --> 39:23.926
Okay.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.624
It bought me two weeks.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.408
When he calls again,

39:27.452 --> 39:30.368
the failed proposal will
be two weeks behind him.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.157
...her younger sister Nadia.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.637
Nadia, when did you
first realize--

39:38.680 --> 39:40.639
Turn that up.

39:40.682 --> 39:42.641
No one in the family's heard from her in a few days,

39:42.684 --> 39:45.426
and Marissa's not the type to just disappear.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.124
We're all very worried about her.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.387
Marissa's 5'6"...

39:52.651 --> 39:54.261
If you have seen her,

39:54.304 --> 39:56.306
Dade County Police is asking for you to call

39:56.350 --> 39:58.831
the tip line that's listed
on the bottom of your screen.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.355
We'll have more on the story
as the investigation unfolds.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.879
Live from Wellsby Crest,
I'm Sandy Gutierrez.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.620
Oh, my God.

40:05.664 --> 40:08.057
They didn't mention anything
about her boyfriend.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.407
Do you think
Emerson could have--

40:09.450 --> 40:11.844
The timing's
pretty coincidental.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.628
Maybe she just ran off
with the other guy

40:13.672 --> 40:15.021
and didn't tell anyone?

40:15.064 --> 40:16.457
I think you need
to call the police.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.198
And tell them what?

40:18.241 --> 40:20.156
I don't have any proof.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.723
First he gets rejected,

40:21.767 --> 40:23.333
and now I'm going to
turn him in as a suspect?

40:23.377 --> 40:25.074
You're not deciding
who's the suspect.

40:25.118 --> 40:26.902
The police will.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.904
You're just giving them
information.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.124
Maybe if I had the tape,
I could give them a copy.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.648
First the tape disappears,
and then she does.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.824
No way. You don't think
Emerson's--

40:35.868 --> 40:37.478
She said that she's
cheating on him,

40:37.522 --> 40:39.219
and then she disappears.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.221
But even if Emerson
did steal the tape,

40:41.264 --> 40:43.136
- why would he do that?
- I don't know.

40:44.616 --> 40:45.878
The tape is motive.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.359
Maybe he didn't want
anyone to see it.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.232
Which would explain why he
didn't take my jewelry.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.103
He didn't need valuables.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.238
Oh, my God.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.196
Who are you calling?

41:00.240 --> 41:01.415
Detective Baker.

41:04.636 --> 41:07.508
Okay. Let me
get this straight.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.858
Uh, your investigative
theory

41:09.902 --> 41:12.557
is that Marissa's
jilted ex Emerson Banes

41:12.600 --> 41:14.254
broke into your house,

41:14.297 --> 41:15.821
stole all of your
editing equipment

41:15.864 --> 41:17.910
to get his hands
on one video of her

41:17.953 --> 41:19.520
confessing
to cheating on her.

41:19.564 --> 41:20.782
- Right?
- Yes.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.480
But it wasn't just that.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.438
Didn't you interview him?

41:24.482 --> 41:26.919
Didn't he tell you that she
turned down his proposal?

41:26.962 --> 41:28.529
He said they broke up,

41:28.573 --> 41:30.618
that she was seeing
someone else,

41:30.662 --> 41:33.055
but he never mentioned
anything about a proposal.

41:35.449 --> 41:36.842
We have his fingerprints,
right?

41:36.885 --> 41:38.452
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll check those

41:38.496 --> 41:39.801
against the ones
we found at the scene,

41:39.845 --> 41:41.324
but no promises.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.065
What about a search warrant?

41:43.109 --> 41:45.198
To see if he has our stuff?

41:45.241 --> 41:46.591
That would prove our theory.

41:46.634 --> 41:49.115
We need probable cause
for that.

41:49.158 --> 41:50.420
And did Marissa say anything

41:50.464 --> 41:52.553
about this other guy
she was seeing?

41:52.597 --> 41:56.644
Uh, mention a name
or where he works or--

41:56.688 --> 42:00.387
No. Just that she met him
at a conference or something.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.041
Actually, no. A trade show.

42:02.084 --> 42:03.956
Do you know
what kind of trade show?

42:03.999 --> 42:05.392
I don't know.

42:07.263 --> 42:09.396
All right. Anything else?

42:09.439 --> 42:12.878
This guy Emerson also
bought Carmen flowers.

42:12.921 --> 42:14.836
It wasn't like that.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.186
The flowers were a thank-you
for me being there for him

42:17.230 --> 42:19.232
when Marissa said no.

42:19.275 --> 42:21.930
Look, I gave him
a little pep talk.

42:21.974 --> 42:24.063
It was red roses.

42:24.106 --> 42:26.718
And he asked her out.

42:26.761 --> 42:29.416
For coffee. I said no.

42:29.459 --> 42:31.113
That was quick.

42:31.157 --> 42:33.202
You know, for a jilted ex.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.165
So what do you think?

42:39.208 --> 42:41.689
I don't know.
We'll just wait and see.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.125
Okay.

42:52.091 --> 42:54.397
I thought you were going
to be out of town.

43:02.318 --> 43:04.538
I'm telling you,
it wouldn't surprise me

43:04.582 --> 43:05.844
if he did kidnap that girl.

43:07.193 --> 43:08.890
The guy's weird.

43:08.934 --> 43:10.892
I hope you're wrong.

43:12.677 --> 43:13.939
Oh, it's Ayla.

43:15.244 --> 43:17.464
Hi, honey. How are you?

43:17.507 --> 43:19.858
Mom, you need to come get me.

43:19.901 --> 43:21.816
I can't stand being here.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.557
Why? What happened?

43:23.601 --> 43:26.691
All Dad does
is show off for Zoe,

43:26.734 --> 43:29.781
and she's-- --
over him all the time.

43:29.824 --> 43:31.652
It's disgusting.

43:31.696 --> 43:33.698
And they're so bad
at camping, Mom.

43:33.741 --> 43:35.177
The first night,

43:35.221 --> 43:37.658
they took a whole hour
to start the campfire,

43:37.702 --> 43:39.660
and someone had to come
and help us.

43:39.704 --> 43:42.402
Ayla, cut your father
some slack.

43:42.445 --> 43:44.012
Not everyone knows how
to light a campfire.

43:45.753 --> 43:48.538
I miss my friends, Mom.

43:48.582 --> 43:50.584
And half the time I don't
even get Todd's texts

43:50.628 --> 43:52.542
because there's no
cell service here.

43:52.586 --> 43:53.805
I've given it a fair shot.

43:53.848 --> 43:55.676
Just-- Just call Dad

43:55.720 --> 43:57.460
and tell him that there's
been an emergency or something

43:57.504 --> 43:59.549
and that he needs
to be home right away.

43:59.593 --> 44:02.465
I am not going
to lie to your father.

44:02.509 --> 44:05.033
Do me a favor
and just tough it out.

44:05.077 --> 44:07.906
I know this is not
your dream vacation,

44:07.949 --> 44:10.604
but maybe there'll be a surprise for you at the end.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.172
A surprise? Really?

44:13.215 --> 44:15.087
What is it, a puppy?

44:15.130 --> 44:17.350
I don't know. We'll talk
about it in two weeks.

44:17.393 --> 44:20.005
In the meantime,
just take a deep breath

44:20.048 --> 44:22.616
and try to have
a good time.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.837
Fine. But it better be
a puppy or better, though.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.534
Okay, honey.
I'll talk to you later.

44:27.577 --> 44:29.623
I love you.
I miss you.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.886
Love you, too. Bye.

44:31.930 --> 44:35.498
So I guess we're
getting a guard dog?

44:35.542 --> 44:37.109
I'm gonna tell her

44:37.152 --> 44:38.588
to find one that's
already potty trained.

44:41.287 --> 44:42.288
Yes.

44:45.944 --> 44:47.380
Oh, I know, I know.

44:47.423 --> 44:49.121
He made you do it.
He made you do it.

44:49.164 --> 44:50.513
He made you lie to me

44:50.557 --> 44:51.863
and say you were
going on vacation

44:51.906 --> 44:53.299
because he was
threatened by me.

44:53.342 --> 44:55.475
I know. I know, baby.

44:55.518 --> 44:58.217
He can't love you
like me.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.435
Oh, no.

45:15.974 --> 45:16.975
Detective.

45:17.018 --> 45:18.063
Hi.

45:18.106 --> 45:19.891
Hi. Any word on Marissa?

45:19.934 --> 45:22.676
No, sadly, no,

45:22.720 --> 45:24.373
but, uh, I had
a couple of questions.

45:24.417 --> 45:25.810
I was hoping I could
come in and talk to you.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.812
Actually, I was just
on my way to the gym.

45:27.855 --> 45:29.378
Any chance this could wait?

45:29.422 --> 45:31.772
Uh, well, hey, I mean,
I wouldn't want

45:31.816 --> 45:34.166
my trying to solve
the disappearance of your ex

45:34.209 --> 45:37.256
to get in the way of your
grueling workout schedule.

45:37.299 --> 45:38.779
I'll be quick.

45:38.823 --> 45:39.867
Please.

45:41.216 --> 45:43.436
Well, uh, you mentioned

45:43.479 --> 45:45.568
that Marissa told you that she
was seeing somebody else.

45:45.612 --> 45:47.440
Yeah. That's right.

45:47.483 --> 45:49.398
Yeah, I was just wondering

45:49.442 --> 45:52.010
under what circumstance
this conversation came up.

45:52.053 --> 45:53.533
I mean, were you--

45:53.576 --> 45:55.578
were you at home?

45:55.622 --> 45:58.016
We were at
the botanical gardens,

45:58.059 --> 46:00.105
and I brought up marriage,

46:00.148 --> 46:02.324
and she told me she was
seeing someone else.

46:02.368 --> 46:04.283
So you proposed?

46:04.326 --> 46:07.112
Like, with-- with a ring
and everything?

46:07.155 --> 46:09.810
I don't see what this has to do
with your investigation.

46:09.854 --> 46:12.117
Well, I mean, it's--

46:12.160 --> 46:14.554
it's tough when you
pop the question.

46:14.597 --> 46:15.947
You know?

46:15.990 --> 46:17.775
Put your heart out there.

46:19.559 --> 46:20.821
You must have been
pretty humiliated

46:20.865 --> 46:21.779
when she said no.

46:22.910 --> 46:24.738
I was sad.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.088
I was disappointed.

46:27.132 --> 46:29.351
But I wouldn't say
humiliated.

46:31.136 --> 46:32.790
So if that's everything--

46:32.833 --> 46:36.576
Uh, actually, I just
have one more question

46:36.619 --> 46:37.490
I wanted to ask you.

46:38.926 --> 46:40.362
Where were you
Sunday morning

46:40.406 --> 46:42.887
between 9:30 and about 11?

46:42.930 --> 46:44.976
I-- I was here, in fact.

46:45.019 --> 46:46.238
Why?

46:46.281 --> 46:47.805
Well, it's just
that the, uh,

46:47.848 --> 46:50.111
tape of your proposal,

46:50.155 --> 46:52.810
which you paid
a pretty penny for,

46:52.853 --> 46:55.116
uh, was stolen
from Carmen's house.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.336
Someone broke into Carmen's
house? Is she okay?

46:57.379 --> 46:59.338
Oh. Oh, yeah.
She's fine. She's fine.

46:59.381 --> 47:01.296
She wasn't there
when it happened.

47:01.340 --> 47:02.471
Okay. Good.

47:02.515 --> 47:04.082
- So yeah.
- Good.

47:04.125 --> 47:07.172
Listen, if I thought
any part of that proposal

47:07.215 --> 47:08.826
was relevant
to the investigation,

47:08.869 --> 47:10.305
I definitely would have
shared that with you earlier.

47:10.349 --> 47:11.698
Mm-hmm.

47:11.741 --> 47:14.266
So, uh, if I could
just walk to my car--

47:14.309 --> 47:15.093
- Sure.
- Thanks.

47:20.402 --> 47:21.751
Was there anything else

47:21.795 --> 47:24.015
you might have forgotten
to mention?

47:24.058 --> 47:25.712
No.

47:25.755 --> 47:27.888
All right.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.324
I'll be in touch.

47:29.368 --> 47:30.935
I'm sure you will.

47:40.161 --> 47:41.641
- Hey.
- Hi.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.077
We didn't get enough cable,

47:43.121 --> 47:44.687
so I'm going to head out.

47:44.731 --> 47:46.211
You going to be okay?

47:46.254 --> 47:48.604
Yeah. I have a meeting
in an hour.

47:50.606 --> 47:52.217
All right.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.914
I will see you later.

47:53.958 --> 47:54.915
Okay.

48:28.731 --> 48:32.561
Mr. Gerner,
your ring is ready.

48:32.605 --> 48:35.129
2.75 pear shaped.

48:35.173 --> 48:36.870
Just an incredible ring.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.480
- It's gorgeous.
- Yeah.

48:38.524 --> 48:39.829
What's your
girlfriend's name?

48:39.873 --> 48:41.005
Carmen.

48:41.048 --> 48:42.571
Carmen. Do you know

48:42.615 --> 48:44.182
how you're going
to propose yet?

48:44.225 --> 48:47.185
Not yet. My, uh,
soon-to-be-stepdaughter

48:47.228 --> 48:49.230
is helping me plan it out.

48:49.274 --> 48:51.145
Okay. Nice.

48:51.189 --> 48:54.583
So I'm just going to need
you to sign right here,

48:54.627 --> 48:56.629
tell me that you
received the ring,

48:56.672 --> 48:58.544
and you're ready to go.

48:58.587 --> 49:00.546
Remember, she can
bring it in for sizing

49:00.589 --> 49:02.069
- if she needs to.
- Okay.

49:02.113 --> 49:03.592
- All right, sir.
- Thank you very much.

49:03.636 --> 49:04.985
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

49:14.038 --> 49:15.561
That's lovely.

49:15.604 --> 49:18.825
Okay. So you want
to do this here?

49:18.868 --> 49:20.740
- Yeah.
- In the conference room?

49:20.783 --> 49:23.134
Yeah. So one of the ladies
in Luke's department

49:23.177 --> 49:24.874
is retiring,
so we're going to pretend

49:24.918 --> 49:26.528
to be throwing her
a retirement party,

49:26.572 --> 49:28.748
but really it's going
to be me proposing.

49:28.791 --> 49:31.751
That's genius.
I love that idea.

49:31.794 --> 49:34.232
So I'd be in there pretending
to record the retirement

49:34.275 --> 49:36.625
when in all actuality I'm
there to record your proposal.

49:36.669 --> 49:38.323
- That's fabulous.
- Yes.

49:38.366 --> 49:39.759
Oh, this is going
to be perfect.

49:41.065 --> 49:42.109
- Ohh.
- Okay.

49:42.153 --> 49:44.024
So when do you
want to do this?

49:44.068 --> 49:45.591
When do you want
to pop the question?

49:54.382 --> 49:55.296
Hey!

49:57.211 --> 49:59.474
Somebody call 911.

49:59.518 --> 50:00.519
You okay?

50:00.562 --> 50:01.868
Guy just took off.

50:05.263 --> 50:06.351
Yeah.

50:06.394 --> 50:07.613
Let's go.

50:07.656 --> 50:08.831
- Hey. Stop it.
- Yeah.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.356
- Heads up.
- Hey.

50:11.399 --> 50:13.314
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Check this out.

50:13.358 --> 50:14.533
- What?
- You see that?

50:22.671 --> 50:23.933
- Hi. Sorry. I'm looking for--
- Carmen.

50:23.977 --> 50:25.674
- Carmen.
- Ryan.

50:25.718 --> 50:27.067
- Why?
- Hey.

50:27.111 --> 50:29.113
No, please.
Sit down. Sit down.

50:29.156 --> 50:30.679
What happened?

50:30.723 --> 50:33.204
Some guy came flying
around the corner

50:33.247 --> 50:34.596
like a bat out of hell.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.511
Luckily,
I jumped out of the way.

50:36.555 --> 50:38.078
Are you hurt?

50:38.122 --> 50:40.341
What did the doctor say?

50:40.385 --> 50:42.126
I just banged up
my shoulder.

50:42.169 --> 50:44.911
They did X-rays.
There's nothing broken.

50:44.954 --> 50:46.565
Did you report the car?

50:46.608 --> 50:48.262
I didn't get
a good look at it.

50:48.306 --> 50:51.004
Just a fancy red
sports car.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.006
I mean,
what's wrong with people?

50:53.050 --> 50:54.268
Hey.

50:54.312 --> 50:55.617
Hey.

50:55.661 --> 50:57.228
I'm okay.

50:57.271 --> 50:58.925
I really am.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.537
Okay.

51:02.581 --> 51:04.539
Can we go home now?

51:04.583 --> 51:06.585
Yeah. Let's go.

51:09.457 --> 51:10.850
On second thought,

51:10.893 --> 51:13.896
I think I need
a hot nurse named Carmen

51:13.940 --> 51:28.520
to take care of me.

51:28.563 --> 51:31.088
It's just
so beautiful out here.

51:31.131 --> 51:32.654
Yeah.
Super relaxing.

51:32.698 --> 51:33.916
Love it.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.092
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

51:37.181 --> 51:38.878
Really nice.

51:38.921 --> 51:40.706
Oh, my God, babe.

51:40.749 --> 51:42.011
- I think I got something.
- Really?

51:42.055 --> 51:43.404
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

51:43.448 --> 51:44.797
- How do I do this?
- Okay, let me help you.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.059
- Oh.
- All right.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.409
Just-- Just reel it in slowly.

51:48.453 --> 51:49.845
- Okay. Like this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:49.889 --> 51:50.672
- Okay.
- There we go.

51:51.891 --> 51:52.761
You're a natural, baby.

51:52.805 --> 51:53.675
Ohh.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.550
Wait. Let me get it.

51:58.593 --> 52:00.508
What do you think,
Ayla? Dinner?

52:00.552 --> 52:02.162
Ayla, isn't it great?

52:02.206 --> 52:03.294
Yeah!

52:05.296 --> 52:07.080
Put me out of my misery.

52:11.954 --> 52:13.913
This is Detective Price.

52:13.956 --> 52:16.220
Hey. We've got a body.

52:16.263 --> 52:17.830
I think it's your missing girl.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.266
- Text me the info.
- Right.

52:22.356 --> 52:24.097
Aw. That's so cute.

52:33.541 --> 52:36.240
So just say something
congratulatory to them.

52:36.283 --> 52:37.589
- Okay.
- Thank you.

52:37.632 --> 52:40.331
Okay. And action.

52:40.374 --> 52:43.551
I just want to say
congratulations to you both,

52:43.595 --> 52:48.600
and I hope you two have
a beautiful life together.

52:48.643 --> 52:49.688
Okay.

52:52.473 --> 52:53.779
Hey, Tracy.

52:53.822 --> 52:55.824
Hi!

52:55.868 --> 52:57.261
How'd it go?

53:07.271 --> 53:08.185
Hmm.

53:10.709 --> 53:12.058
Are you okay?

53:12.101 --> 53:14.452
Yeah. I just need
to make a quick call.

53:14.495 --> 53:15.888
Well, I just got word

53:15.931 --> 53:17.498
that Luke's
on his way down,

53:17.542 --> 53:18.760
so I'm going to
go hide in the bathroom.

53:18.804 --> 53:19.674
Okay.

53:25.680 --> 53:26.899
Hey.

53:26.942 --> 53:28.683
Ryan,
I just saw Emerson.

53:28.727 --> 53:30.163
He was here.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.599
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

53:31.643 --> 53:33.558
And he was driving
a red sports car

53:33.601 --> 53:35.473
that might have been
the car that hit you.

53:35.516 --> 53:37.257
Okay, where are you?
I'm coming there.

53:37.301 --> 53:39.259
He drove off when he
saw me at the window.

53:39.303 --> 53:40.956
I just wanted
to let you know.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.349
Now where are you?

53:42.393 --> 53:43.829
I'm at the Luke
and Jessie proposal.

53:43.872 --> 53:45.744
What if he
drove around the corner

53:45.787 --> 53:47.180
and is waiting for you to leave?

53:47.224 --> 53:48.486
He's not. I'll call
Detective Price

53:48.529 --> 53:49.661
when I'm done, okay?

53:49.704 --> 53:51.402
I love you.
I got to go. Bye.

53:51.445 --> 53:52.794
No. Mm.

54:08.593 --> 54:10.638
Aw!

54:16.078 --> 54:18.994
Hmm. Uh, I don't think
this cake is for me.

54:19.038 --> 54:20.126
- Huh?
- Hmm?

54:21.475 --> 54:22.737
Luke,

54:22.781 --> 54:24.391
I think
this cake is for you.

54:26.219 --> 54:27.307
Guys, come here.

54:31.833 --> 54:33.008
For Luke.

54:33.052 --> 54:34.140
Yep.

54:37.665 --> 54:39.711
All right, yes.

54:41.321 --> 54:42.801
Will you marry me?

54:42.844 --> 54:44.498
Yes.

54:44.542 --> 54:45.978
- Whoo!
- Yes.

54:52.985 --> 54:54.334
Here's the rest
of his junk.

54:54.378 --> 54:55.379
All right. Thanks.

54:57.946 --> 55:00.384
Detective,
you need to see this.

55:16.530 --> 55:18.010
Wow.

55:19.228 --> 55:20.273
Hi, honey.

55:20.317 --> 55:21.579
What are you doing here?

55:21.622 --> 55:23.494
I was worried about you.

55:23.537 --> 55:25.191
Come on.
Let's load this stuff up.

55:25.234 --> 55:27.106
We'll go to the police
station together.

55:27.149 --> 55:28.368
Okay.

55:29.848 --> 55:31.371
We don't know for sure

55:31.415 --> 55:33.330
if it's the same car,
but...

55:34.679 --> 55:36.637
Is this the car
he was driving?

55:36.681 --> 55:38.509
It looks like it, yes.

55:38.552 --> 55:39.901
And it looks
a lot like the one

55:39.945 --> 55:41.555
that tried to run me over.

55:41.599 --> 55:43.470
I wouldn't be surprised
if he did want Ryan dead.

55:43.514 --> 55:46.038
We got a search warrant
for his house, and, uh...

55:47.474 --> 55:48.562
we found this.

55:50.608 --> 55:52.261
Oh, my God.

55:52.305 --> 55:53.524
They're all of me.

55:53.567 --> 55:55.308
Where did he
get these pictures?

55:55.352 --> 55:57.397
Some are from my web site,

55:57.441 --> 55:58.572
some are from our
personal footage.

56:00.705 --> 56:02.576
Oh, my God, Ryan.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.317
It looks like he's been
taking pictures of me

56:04.361 --> 56:05.623
through the window.

56:05.666 --> 56:07.146
This guy's insane.

56:07.189 --> 56:08.713
It gets worse.

56:08.756 --> 56:11.280
We recovered a body
two days ago.

56:11.324 --> 56:14.327
Dental records confirm
it was Marissa Stefans.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.329
Oh, my God.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.678
Evidence at the scene
led us to get the warrant.

56:17.722 --> 56:19.288
What evidence?

56:19.332 --> 56:20.638
This.

56:20.681 --> 56:22.335
That looks just
like the ring he used

56:22.379 --> 56:23.858
the day he proposed to her.

56:23.902 --> 56:25.643
I put it in the box
for him.

56:25.686 --> 56:27.471
We also have casts
of tire tracks

56:27.514 --> 56:28.776
that were left
at the location

56:28.820 --> 56:30.430
where Marissa's body
was dumped.

56:30.474 --> 56:33.346
We believe they'll match
the treads on his car.

56:33.390 --> 56:35.479
We just haven't been
able to locate it yet.

56:35.522 --> 56:38.482
So basically there's
a killer out there

56:38.525 --> 56:41.310
stalking Carmen
and waiting to kill me

56:41.354 --> 56:43.356
whenever the opportunity
arises.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.750
In short, yes.

56:45.793 --> 56:48.622
Now, we're doing everything
we can to find this guy.

56:48.666 --> 56:51.756
But you may see him
before we do.

56:51.799 --> 56:53.279
I need you to contact
me immediately

56:53.322 --> 56:54.802
if he makes another
appearance, okay?

56:54.846 --> 56:56.064
Of course.

56:56.108 --> 56:57.718
Of course.

56:59.981 --> 57:02.854
Okay. So unlocking
the door with the key

57:02.897 --> 57:04.159
automatically
disarms it,

57:04.203 --> 57:05.726
so every time you come in,

57:05.770 --> 57:07.336
you just have to push
this button right here

57:07.380 --> 57:09.426
to rearm it.
Now, if it's armed

57:09.469 --> 57:10.862
and you open any other
doors without a key,

57:10.905 --> 57:12.211
the alarm will go off,

57:12.254 --> 57:13.604
and it'll alert
the response center.

57:13.647 --> 57:15.519
Okay. Seems easy enough.

57:15.562 --> 57:17.434
Okay. So just sign
for me here.

57:17.477 --> 57:19.174
And I just have to finish up the master switch,

57:19.218 --> 57:20.567
and I'll be done.

57:20.611 --> 57:21.916
- Perfect.
- All right. Thank you.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.962
Thank you.

57:24.005 --> 57:28.488
1114-- Ayla's birthday.

57:28.532 --> 57:30.055
Do you feel better now?

57:30.098 --> 57:32.274
A little. Yeah.

57:36.061 --> 57:37.018
We'll be good.

57:37.062 --> 57:38.150
Okay.

57:41.109 --> 57:42.807
Do you miss me?

57:42.850 --> 57:44.548
Like crazy.

57:44.591 --> 57:45.897
I wish you were
going to Elle's party

57:45.940 --> 57:47.028
with me Friday night.

57:47.072 --> 57:48.116
Everyone we know is going.

57:48.160 --> 57:51.772
Elle? As in your ex?

57:51.816 --> 57:53.513
Whoa, she's not my ex.

57:53.557 --> 57:55.602
We hung out for, like,
three weeks.

57:55.646 --> 57:57.517
How are things
with your dad?

57:57.561 --> 57:59.650
I feel
like a third wheel.

57:59.693 --> 58:01.913
He wouldn't even notice
if I was gone.

58:01.956 --> 58:03.262
I mean, this morning--

58:06.483 --> 58:07.832
Damn it.

58:09.442 --> 58:16.754
This is so unfair.

58:37.905 --> 58:39.037
Ryan?

58:40.734 --> 58:42.257
Hey.

58:42.301 --> 58:43.345
Hey!

58:48.829 --> 58:49.917
What happened?

58:51.397 --> 58:53.399
I saw him out there.

58:53.442 --> 58:54.835
He was creeping around.

59:00.014 --> 59:02.147
I swear to God
I'm gonna kill this guy.

59:04.279 --> 59:06.194
- I swear to God--
- No. Wait.

59:06.238 --> 59:07.631
Maybe you shouldn't
touch that.

59:07.674 --> 59:09.589
"You deserve someone
who'd be excited

59:09.633 --> 59:11.591
"to spend their life
with you,

59:11.635 --> 59:14.638
"proud to be by your side.

59:14.681 --> 59:15.726
"That's not him.

59:16.901 --> 59:18.598
It's me."

59:18.642 --> 59:21.906
This guy's
a delusional prick.

59:21.949 --> 59:23.690
It's what I said to him.

59:23.734 --> 59:25.605
The first part. That's
what I said to him

59:25.649 --> 59:27.476
after Marissa
said no to him.

59:27.520 --> 59:29.696
And I've had
enough of this guy.

59:29.740 --> 59:31.350
I'm calling the cops,

59:31.393 --> 59:32.786
and I'm gonna get them
to send someone over

59:32.830 --> 59:34.092
to stake out our house.

59:40.968 --> 59:44.885
Detective, how close
are you to catching him?

59:44.929 --> 59:47.061
Well, we've been
staking out his place

59:47.105 --> 59:48.193
since we issued the warrant.

59:48.236 --> 59:51.413
But he hasn't been back yet.

59:51.457 --> 59:54.678
Because he's been busy
buying her roses.

59:54.721 --> 59:57.506
We're gonna have an officer in an unmarked
car watch your house from now on.

59:57.550 --> 59:59.683
Oh, that's great.
Okay.

59:59.726 --> 01:00:02.773
We really wanna catch
this guy as soon as possible.

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:05.210
- We could use your help.
- In what way?

01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:08.082
We might be able to draw him out
if you agree to meet with him.

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:11.651
- But it sounds dangerous.
- It is.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.871
But we'd have a team there
ready to take him out

01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:15.655
- as soon as he showed his face.
- Wait.

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:18.353
So you're saying that I have
to meet with him face to face?

01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:20.007
Most likely, yes.

01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:21.835
Oh, I don't know.
I have a daughter.

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:24.795
All the more reason to make
sure he's behind bars, right?

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:26.710
- Let me think about it.
- Don't take too long.

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:40.114
I think it's a terrible idea.

01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:42.726
But if I help them catch him,

01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:44.858
then we do not have to worry
about looking over our shoulders

01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:46.164
like you've been doing
this entire time.

01:00:46.207 --> 01:00:49.646
- I have not.
- You have, and so have I.

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.386
Look, they're the police.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:54.172
It's their job to catch
the bad guys.

01:00:54.215 --> 01:00:56.522
What if you do this,
and he pulls a gun

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:59.046
and shoots you before they can stop him?
What then?

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.439
What if we leave
this restaurant

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:02.267
and he shoots one of us
in the parking lot?

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:05.357
I just think it's risky
to try to lure him out.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.794
He's been hanging
around the house.

01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:09.666
So, the next time he does,
the cops are gonna be there.

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:12.364
I agree with you.
It's risky.

01:01:12.407 --> 01:01:14.279
But Ayla will be home
in a week and a half,

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:17.151
and I rather he be in jail
when she gets home.

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.544
So we have no choice.

01:01:21.808 --> 01:01:23.027
Okay.

01:01:27.118 --> 01:01:29.033
All right, listen,
Marissa's sister told us

01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:30.774
that Emerson's idea of love

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:35.039
can be somewhat obsessive.

01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:38.129
All right?
Just keep that in mind.

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:40.348
- Okay.
- You ready?

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:41.480
Yeah.

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.701
Dial the number.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.967
You reached Emerson.
I'm unavailable right now.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:51.751
But leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:55.189
Hi, Emerson, it's Carmen.

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:58.062
I just wanted to thank you
for the flowers.

01:01:58.105 --> 01:02:00.891
But most importantly,
what you said in the card.

01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:05.896
I just wanted
to let you know that

01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:08.463
I haven't been able to get
you out of my mind

01:02:08.507 --> 01:02:10.596
since the day we met.

01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:11.902
So I was kind of wondering

01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:14.731
if maybe we can meet
for that cup of coffee.

01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.299
Or maybe dinner.

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:22.782
Let me know.

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:24.044
Hope to hear from you soon.

01:02:26.481 --> 01:02:27.526
Bye.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.444
Perfect.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:26.063
How you doing?

01:03:26.106 --> 01:03:28.413
Hey, would you mind
if I used your cell phone?

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:31.068
Sorry. English no good.

01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:33.592
Your mobile?

01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:36.073
Mine's dead.
The battery's shot.

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:38.858
I promised my wife I would
text her before I took off.

01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:42.209
What do you say?

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:49.347
Thank you.

01:03:58.965 --> 01:04:02.403
That's it.
Thanks a lot.

01:04:08.627 --> 01:04:11.760
Babe, I just got
a text message from Emerson.

01:04:11.804 --> 01:04:14.198
What does he say?

01:04:14.241 --> 01:04:16.635
He says, "Carmen, hi.
It's Emerson. I got your message.

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.855
"The police think
I killed Marissa.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.769
"And they're looking for me,
so I had to leave the country.

01:04:20.813 --> 01:04:22.380
"I didn't do it.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.295
"I will call you
when all of this blows over.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:28.299
"In the meantime,
dump the loser."

01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:30.736
Let's see where this
phone number's coming from.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:40.920
Haiti?

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:45.403
Let's call Detective Price.

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:47.187
All right, Ryan, thanks.

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:49.015
I'll talk to you soon.

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:50.495
Bye.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.373
Hey.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:02.159
Zoe and I are gonna hike
up to the waterfall.

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:05.075
- Come with us.
- You totally should.

01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:07.773
We can pick up
those matching tank tops

01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:09.557
and take some selfies.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:11.908
Uh, I think I'm just
gonna take a nap.

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:13.866
But you guys have fun,
though.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:17.957
- Really? Boo.
- I'm exhausted.

01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:22.135
Okay. We'll be back soon.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:24.746
- Get some rest, okay?
- Okay.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.487
Bye. See you soon.

01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:33.581
Get me out of this place
and into civilization.

01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:48.422
Baker, what do you got.

01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:51.860
We found his car
at the airport.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:54.689
- It's being towed and processed now.
- Good.

01:05:54.733 --> 01:05:57.649
I actually just got off the phone with a guy named Rinya.

01:05:57.692 --> 01:06:00.260
He said a guy a the airport
gave him 50 bucks

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.610
to let him use his phone
to send a text.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.788
Gave a positive I.D.

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:09.313
Of course, he did.

01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:11.706
Question is,
did Emerson go to the airport

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:14.274
to take a flight somewhere,

01:06:14.318 --> 01:06:16.624
or to make us think
he was leaving town?

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.887
Well, I actually have
Howard calling the TSA

01:06:18.931 --> 01:06:21.673
to see if anyone's
used Emerson's passport,

01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:24.806
as well as the airlines to see if anybody's booked a seat in his name.

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.679
We should also check
video surveillance.

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:29.637
Good idea.
I'll ask the captain,

01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:30.812
see if we can take
a couple people

01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:31.770
off the Exley case
to do just that.

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:45.784
Oh, my God.
Look at this one.

01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:47.960
She's such a cutie-pie.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.658
Hi, there. Hi.

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:52.008
Hello, hello.

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:58.101
I do have one more
to show you.

01:06:58.144 --> 01:06:59.972
I can bring them out.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.540
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:08.067
Okay! This is Cody!

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.765
He's two years old,
and I know he's not a puppy.

01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.680
But he's quite amazing.
He knows lots of tricks.

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:14.726
Watch. Down.

01:07:14.769 --> 01:07:16.510
Good, Cody.

01:07:16.554 --> 01:07:18.773
Leave it.
Leave it.

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.862
Leave it.
Get it.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:24.040
Good boy. And he's
a great guard dog too.

01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:29.436
- Hi. Thank you.
- Hi, Cody.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.830
Hello. Hi, there.

01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:34.137
I like the idea of
having an older dog.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.356
But do you think Ayla's
gonna be okay with it?

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.055
She wanted a puppy.

01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:42.101
I think Ayla will be happy
just having a dog.

01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:46.932
Huh? How you doing?

01:07:48.803 --> 01:07:51.284
Thank you. Yes.

01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:53.156
I still don't understand.

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:54.418
Why didn't you answer my text?

01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:55.593
I was getting worried.

01:07:55.636 --> 01:07:57.160
I'm sorry. My battery died.

01:07:57.203 --> 01:08:00.467
I forgot the charger.

01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:03.427
I have great news.
I might be able to get to that party after all.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.994
Seriously? Oh, my God.
That's awesome. I can't wait.

01:08:06.038 --> 01:08:08.867
Okay. I gotta go. Bye,

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.435
- Hi.
- You must be Ayla. Hi.

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.745
- Baker, what's up?
- Well...

01:08:17.788 --> 01:08:20.487
I just checked the surveillance
footage from the airport

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:22.533
and it clearly shows Emerson
leaving the terminal

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:23.621
and hopping into a cab.

01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:25.318
I sent you the link.

01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:26.537
Wait, so he's
still in town?

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.104
Looks that way.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:31.845
I have to go to
the pet store and get a bed,

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:34.197
a leash, food.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.678
And toys.
Definitely some new toys.

01:08:37.721 --> 01:08:40.986
I see someone's looking
forward to being a doggy dad.

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:42.553
Yes, I am.

01:08:57.394 --> 01:08:59.004
Don't forget to rate your
experience.

01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:01.615
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much. Bye.

01:09:01.658 --> 01:09:02.921
Bye.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.060
Mom?

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:16.412
Hey, Mom?

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.023
Ryan!

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:55.278
We haven't paid for it yet.

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:57.671
- That's all right.
- I like this.

01:09:57.715 --> 01:09:59.195
How many toys do you need?

01:09:59.238 --> 01:10:00.239
Oh, that's cute.

01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:05.375
Hey, Carmen.

01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:07.464
It's Detective Price.

01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:09.640
We just found out
that Emerson Banes

01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.381
is still in town.

01:10:11.424 --> 01:10:13.731
I'm sending a officer
back out to watch your house.

01:10:57.775 --> 01:10:58.993
Ayla left.

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:00.952
- I can't find her.
- What?

01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:02.127
What do you mean
Ayla left?

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.390
What's going on?

01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:06.087
Zoe and I went
for a quick hike, okay?

01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:09.090
When we came back,
we found a note.

01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:11.528
It just says...

01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:12.659
she's heading home early.

01:11:12.703 --> 01:11:15.749
Oh my God, Nick. Really?

01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:17.708
Fine. Let me call her,
and I'll call you back.

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:18.709
Hopefully, I can reach her.

01:11:18.752 --> 01:11:19.884
Okay.

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:23.627
Message.

01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:25.846
Ayla, honey, it's Mom.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.719
Daddy just called me
and he said that you left.

01:11:28.762 --> 01:11:31.069
He's worried.
I'm worried.

01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:33.158
Can you please call me back
and let us know you're okay?

01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:34.986
I love you.

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:37.118
Maybe she took an Uber back.

01:11:37.162 --> 01:11:39.077
She could be at the house.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.862
Then why isn't she calling
or answering her phone?

01:11:41.906 --> 01:11:44.822
We have a missed call
from Detective Price.

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:47.520
Hey, Carmen,
it's Detective Price.

01:11:47.564 --> 01:11:51.916
Listen, Emerson Banes
is still in town.

01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:53.657
I'm sending an officer
back out to watch your house.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.571
Oh, my God!

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.062
I'm in position.

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:29.519
Hey, listen to me.

01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:34.959
I don't want to hurt you.

01:12:35.002 --> 01:12:37.135
I just need your mother
to do something for me,

01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:39.398
which I'm fairly confident
she's gonna do.

01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:41.705
And then I'll let her know
where she can find you.

01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:42.923
Hey!

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.493
If you try and run away

01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:49.756
or make any noise,

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.888
I will hurt you.

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:54.413
So be quiet.

01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:56.763
Be good.

01:12:56.807 --> 01:12:58.678
You're gonna be home
in a matter of hours.

01:12:58.722 --> 01:13:00.027
All right?

01:13:20.961 --> 01:13:22.441
Ayla?

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:23.790
Honey, can you check
upstairs, please?

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:26.097
- Yeah.
- Ayla.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.228
Ayla?

01:13:29.317 --> 01:13:31.972
Ayla, honey,
are you home?

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:33.234
Ayla?

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.761
- Carmen!
- Yeah?

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:40.111
Get up here!

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.242
What's going on?

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:42.679
We can't find my daughter.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.945
Carmen!

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.468
What is it?

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:50.904
Oh!

01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:53.472
Oh my God, this
is her stuff!

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.126
This isn't right,
something happened.

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.954
Do something!

01:13:56.997 --> 01:14:00.218
- Her bag!
- No, don't touch anything.

01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:01.393
The alarm company
should have a record

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.960
of when she unlocked
the door.

01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:04.178
I've got-- I've got their
number downstairs.

01:14:04.222 --> 01:14:05.963
Let's call 'em.

01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:12.622
Good girl.

01:14:14.232 --> 01:14:15.799
Tell you what:

01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:18.671
why don't we call
your mom right now?

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:21.065
I'll let you speak with her,
would you like that?

01:14:21.108 --> 01:14:22.980
Yeah?

01:14:23.023 --> 01:14:24.503
All right.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.770
Ayla!

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:32.946
Hi, honey, where are you?
Are you okay?

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:36.689
Ayla?

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:40.388
Ayla, honey,
are you there?

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:43.522
She's here.
With me.

01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:45.916
Let me talk to her.

01:14:45.959 --> 01:14:47.918
In a minute.

01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:49.920
I need you to do
something for me

01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:52.531
and Ayla's gonna
be just fine.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:54.664
You need to hire a
private charter

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.404
that is going to
take me to the Bahamas.

01:14:56.448 --> 01:14:59.930
Once I am in the Bahamas,
I'll let Ayla go.

01:14:59.973 --> 01:15:03.237
If I have any indication

01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:05.370
that the police are
waiting for me in Nassau,

01:15:05.413 --> 01:15:06.850
if they even
approach the boat,

01:15:06.893 --> 01:15:08.199
you are going to find
your daughter

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:10.680
at the bottom
of the Atlantic.

01:15:10.723 --> 01:15:11.811
Well, here's your daughter.

01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:16.033
Mom?

01:15:16.076 --> 01:15:18.862
Ayla!
Ayla, honey,

01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:20.559
we're going to find you.

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:24.955
Find a charter.
You have an hour.

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:26.522
Don't kill your daughter.

01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:36.357
Yes, this is
Detective Colby.

01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:38.969
I need to know the times
the front door was entered.

01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:41.014
He's on with
security right now

01:15:41.058 --> 01:15:42.015
so we can find out
when she got home.

01:15:42.059 --> 01:15:44.452
I need to talk to you.

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:45.453
What?

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:49.283
Emerson kidnapped her.

01:15:49.327 --> 01:15:50.850
I just spoke to him
on her phone.

01:15:50.894 --> 01:15:51.938
What, he called you?

01:15:51.982 --> 01:15:53.287
Shh!

01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:55.507
He says that if we
involve the police,

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.378
he will kill her.

01:15:57.422 --> 01:15:59.032
How do you know he
hasn't already?

01:15:59.076 --> 01:16:01.426
Because I spoke to her.

01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:04.472
He says that as long as we
get a private charter boat

01:16:04.516 --> 01:16:06.474
to take her to the Bahamas,

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:08.651
he will release her as long as we don't involve the police.

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:10.653
Well, that is insane!
There is no way--

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:11.523
We have an hour.

01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:17.137
I just got off the phone
with the alarm company.

01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:19.444
They said the door was unlocked about an hour and a half ago.

01:16:19.487 --> 01:16:21.141
With the key.

01:16:21.185 --> 01:16:22.795
And it never re-armed.

01:16:22.839 --> 01:16:25.102
The door opened again
less than a minute later.

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:27.974
If it was Emerson,
he followed her in.

01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:28.932
Officer...

01:16:31.848 --> 01:16:33.893
Can we put out
an Amber alert?

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:36.983
I'll call it in now.

01:16:38.506 --> 01:16:39.986
Kelo 2-4, I need a...

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:41.684
Can we at least try
to get a boat, please?

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:43.555
It'll buy us some time.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.731
No, I say we tell Detective
Price what is going on.

01:16:45.775 --> 01:16:48.168
But he said he'd kill her
if we involve the cops.

01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:49.996
Look, I don't believe
for a second

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.607
that he is going
to let her go.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.875
Oh my God, I just
thought of something.

01:16:58.918 --> 01:17:00.790
She has the app on her phone
that if she loses her phone,

01:17:00.833 --> 01:17:01.791
we can find it.

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.270
How do we access it?

01:17:03.314 --> 01:17:04.837
I just have to
log into her account.

01:17:08.841 --> 01:17:10.495
Track my phone.

01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:14.586
Ugh!
It's password protected.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.023
Any ideas?

01:17:17.067 --> 01:17:19.460
Let's try Ayla123.

01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:21.375
It's gonna lock you out.

01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.815
Purple flowers.

01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:27.555
She did a poem about
it last semester.

01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:29.645
But let me try it
on a different website.

01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:30.646
Ah, you got it!

01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:32.038
Yes!

01:17:32.082 --> 01:17:33.649
Okay, back to
tracking her phone.

01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:38.697
I'm in!
I'm in.

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:40.133
She's near the port.

01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:41.700
We've got to
let Price know.

01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:43.833
I'm calling.

01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:55.496
All right, so that's
where the boat is.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.715
Are you sure
you're up for this?

01:17:56.759 --> 01:17:59.544
Absolutely, let's go get them.

01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:00.719
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:04.592
Yeah, I think
she'll be okay.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.208
You really are beautiful,
you know that?

01:18:12.905 --> 01:18:15.342
You kind of remind me
of your mother.

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:16.735
She's beautiful, too.

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:19.346
Leave me alone.

01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:23.394
Well, on the outside.
Inside, dark just like the rest.

01:18:26.745 --> 01:18:28.747
I thought she was different.

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.445
Your mother,
I actually thought

01:18:31.489 --> 01:18:33.665
Marissa rejecting
the whole proposal

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:36.059
was just because I was
supposed to meet your mom.

01:18:36.102 --> 01:18:38.888
'Cause I felt this connection
with her at the garden.

01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:42.239
And I know she felt it, too.

01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:46.547
But then she
betrayed that

01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:49.028
when she called the police.

01:18:49.072 --> 01:18:51.727
That's why they were looking
for my car down at the airport.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.381
That was a test, you see.
She failed.

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:56.601
My mom would never go
for a guy like you.

01:18:56.644 --> 01:18:58.821
She's in love
with Ryan,

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:00.213
and they're going
to get married.

01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:03.434
What if I told you
Ryan was dead?

01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:09.222
Yeah, see,
I ran over him

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:11.268
and left him on
the side of the road.

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:14.445
I doubt he lived
to see the ambulance.

01:19:14.488 --> 01:19:16.795
No, you didn't.

01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:18.492
You're lying.

01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:19.885
You're crazy.

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.975
Just imagine what
two tons of metal

01:19:23.019 --> 01:19:25.108
running over a
human body does.

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:28.024
You end up with
a close-casket funeral.

01:19:30.548 --> 01:19:32.202
You're even beautiful when you get angry,
do you know that?

01:19:35.858 --> 01:19:37.163
And so young.

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:44.127
Anyway, why don't
we call your mom?

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:52.526
It's him.

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:54.267
Hello?

01:19:54.311 --> 01:19:55.834
How's that charter coming?

01:19:55.878 --> 01:19:59.229
I was able to find one.

01:19:59.272 --> 01:20:02.449
Private residence near
the South Cove Marina.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:06.105
Fine. That's fine.

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:07.715
What did you tell them?

01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:09.979
That you will be there
with your daughter.

01:20:10.022 --> 01:20:12.938
I will meet you there
with her passport.

01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:14.679
I'll text you
the address.

01:20:16.115 --> 01:20:19.249
Emerson, if you hurt Ayla,

01:20:19.292 --> 01:20:22.426
I will personally
hunt you down

01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:24.384
and I will kill you.

01:20:24.428 --> 01:20:27.518
You're not going to have
to hunt us down.

01:20:27.561 --> 01:20:28.606
Carmen, you're
coming with us.

01:20:36.788 --> 01:20:38.659
Mom...

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.839
Smile.

01:20:55.198 --> 01:20:56.590
Hello, Carmen.

01:20:56.634 --> 01:20:57.853
Hello.

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.463
Hi, there.

01:20:59.506 --> 01:21:01.291
I'm Captain Hal.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:03.771
You can call me Captain,
or just call me Hal.

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:05.991
Don't call me late for
deep sea fishing, okay?

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:07.688
Huh? In fact, I've got
some poles on board

01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:10.691
if you want to cast a line
out after we shove off.

01:21:10.735 --> 01:21:12.345
Uh, before we do,

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.565
go over a few rules
with you real quick.

01:21:14.608 --> 01:21:17.350
If you're under 18,
you'll be required to wear a life vest

01:21:17.394 --> 01:21:19.526
at all times once we get
out past the harbor.

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:22.094
Uh, you folks over 21,
you're fine.

01:21:22.138 --> 01:21:23.966
You can just throw a life
vest on in case of an emergency

01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:25.750
which I do not
plan on having.

01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:27.839
Also, there's plenty of beer
back there in the cooler.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.450
As you can see,
I've already started.

01:21:30.494 --> 01:21:31.974
Hey, Jon, you want
a beer, don't you?

01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:34.411
It's Emerson. No, I just
want to get going.

01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:36.195
Oh, okay, we can
do that, too.

01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:37.805
Yo, Hal.

01:21:37.849 --> 01:21:39.590
Phew.

01:21:39.633 --> 01:21:40.939
You've seen better days.

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:42.419
I left my ratchet
set on the boat.

01:21:42.462 --> 01:21:45.291
You did. It's in the back there.

01:21:45.335 --> 01:21:46.945
In the compartment.

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:52.690
What's in the box?

01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:54.213
- What's in the box?
- Nothing.

01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:56.041
- Open it!
- There's nothing in there.

01:21:56.085 --> 01:21:57.738
Open the box, I want
so see what's in it.

01:22:01.394 --> 01:22:02.221
Fine. Do what you've
got to do.

01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:03.744
Ayla.

01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:04.789
I'm just grabbing
her a life vest.

01:22:04.832 --> 01:22:06.095
She doesn't need
a life vest.

01:22:06.138 --> 01:22:07.444
- Yes, she does.
- Ayla, come back here.

01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:09.533
I am not asking you,
I am telling you!

01:22:09.576 --> 01:22:10.621
Get down!

01:22:14.016 --> 01:22:15.539
Put the gun down!

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:16.366
I'm not letting her go,
are you kidding me?

01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:17.541
Put the gun down, man.

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.630
I'm not dropping
the gun, man.

01:22:19.673 --> 01:22:20.413
- You don't want to do this.
- You're not gonna shoot me.

01:22:20.457 --> 01:22:22.154
Let her go!

01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:23.634
- Put the gun down!
- You're not gonna shoot.

01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:27.551
Drop the gun,
put it down.

01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:29.161
Put your hands where
I can see them.

01:22:29.205 --> 01:22:30.771
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:22:30.815 --> 01:22:32.469
Anything you say
can and will

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:33.774
be used against you in
a court of law.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.780
You're a great actor.

01:22:39.824 --> 01:22:41.695
I thought you were
really a captain.

01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:44.089
Ha, well, don't tell anybody.
You'll blow my cover, huh?

01:22:44.133 --> 01:22:47.049
I won't.

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:49.573
Colby's taken Emerson
to the ER.

01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:51.444
Don't you girls worry.

01:22:51.488 --> 01:22:53.838
You are never going to be
bothered by that creep again.

01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:55.927
Thank you.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.669
What do you say we get you
out of these wet clothes?

01:22:58.712 --> 01:23:01.672
That sounds like
a great idea.

01:23:01.715 --> 01:23:02.673
Thank you.

01:23:06.894 --> 01:23:08.679
Ryan!

01:23:10.376 --> 01:23:12.378
I knew it, I knew
you were alive!

01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:14.815
He said you were killed!

01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:16.817

you're okay.

No, but... but I think
they're the wrong size.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.868
No, I checked them myself.

01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:53.044
They're a size 7.

01:25:02.314 --> 01:25:04.621

01:25:27.687 --> 01:25:29.907
I had no idea.

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.170
