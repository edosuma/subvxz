00:00.639 --> 00:02.259
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.260 --> 00:05.306
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

00:06.327 --> 00:07.587
We should have known
our mother would not

00:07.588 --> 00:10.086
be bound by anything
as obvious as death.

00:10.087 --> 00:11.122
Esther.

00:11.123 --> 00:12.993
I have come to heal our family.

00:12.994 --> 00:14.911
For you, I will undo everything

00:14.912 --> 00:18.352
that has been done,
thereby giving you a new life.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.000
You mean, you don't
recognize me?

00:20.001 --> 00:21.551
It's been a long time, Finn.

00:21.552 --> 00:23.129
Well, there's no way
Kol would listen

00:23.130 --> 00:24.808
to anything other than his ego.

00:24.809 --> 00:26.663
And even the wildest
us of Mikaelsons

00:26.664 --> 00:28.180
has seen the error of his ways.

00:28.181 --> 00:30.320
- I'm Kaleb.
- Davina.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.305
Aah!

00:33.306 --> 00:36.266
- You filthy dogs.
- It can't be.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.602
- Hello, son.
- Father!

00:38.603 --> 00:40.771
How do you expect to show
them the error of their ways?

00:40.772 --> 00:42.556
Perhaps it's time to
turn our attention

00:42.557 --> 00:45.694
to the outskirts
of our beautiful home.

01:08.659 --> 01:11.051
Any prospects?

01:11.052 --> 01:15.180
Well, since you asked,
yeah, there's this one guy.

01:15.181 --> 01:17.004
I mean, we've only
been messaging so far,

01:17.005 --> 01:19.476
but I think I like him.

01:19.477 --> 01:22.270
Like, really like him.

01:22.271 --> 01:24.084
- So what's the problem?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.963
Might have left a few things
out of the old profile.

01:26.964 --> 01:29.535
For example, what's
got two thumbs

01:29.536 --> 01:31.696
and drinks blood to survive

01:31.697 --> 01:34.236
oh, right. This guy.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.552
What the hell is
wrong with you people?

01:53.553 --> 01:55.391
We didn't do anything.

01:55.392 --> 01:59.641
This nothing your kind
hasn't done to us.

01:59.642 --> 02:00.800
Learn your history.

02:00.801 --> 02:02.002
I don't know
who the hell you are.

02:02.003 --> 02:03.405
We had a deal.

02:03.406 --> 02:06.212
Vampires stay out of the
quarter, everybody's cool.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.669
That's not good enough anymore.

02:07.835 --> 02:10.752
Oh, yeah?
Says who? You,

02:10.753 --> 02:12.524
or that witch you
all answer to now.

02:12.525 --> 02:14.297
Lenore, right?

02:14.298 --> 02:15.533
Never thought I'd see the day...

02:15.534 --> 02:18.618
Proud werewolves
on a witch's leash.

02:18.619 --> 02:21.140
I hope those rings you're
wearing are worth it.

02:24.081 --> 02:25.717
No!

02:25.718 --> 02:26.626
Aah!

02:26.627 --> 02:29.625
That's enough.

02:29.626 --> 02:34.718
Your privileges here have
been revoked permanently.

02:34.719 --> 02:37.053
So when we come back,
you need to be gone

02:37.054 --> 02:39.217
because next time
I won't call them off.

02:41.581 --> 02:44.685
Consider this a warning, Marcel.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.558
It's the only one
you're gonna get.

02:56.896 --> 02:59.284
This is a city of death.

03:03.664 --> 03:06.008
Fires, floods,

03:06.009 --> 03:09.444
to say nothing of the violence
we do to each other.

03:09.445 --> 03:11.779
We may laissez
les bon temps rouler,

03:11.780 --> 03:14.925
but really we've turned life
into one big party

03:14.926 --> 03:19.553
to distract ourselves
from a single unavoidable truth.

03:19.554 --> 03:22.225
We're all going to die.

03:22.226 --> 03:23.893
Is that what you're afraid of?

03:25.629 --> 03:27.364
Who says I'm afraid of anything?

03:27.365 --> 03:29.901
Cami, we've been meeting
like this for weeks now,

03:29.902 --> 03:32.572
and you're still dodging
my questions.

03:32.573 --> 03:33.976
Now how do you expect
your patients

03:33.977 --> 03:36.612
to open up to you when you
won't open up yourself?

03:36.613 --> 03:38.215
I'm open.

03:38.216 --> 03:39.469
What do you want me
to be open about...

03:39.635 --> 03:41.076
My dead uncle, my dead brother?

03:41.077 --> 03:43.089
How about the living?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.825
I mean, you're
highly intelligent,

03:44.826 --> 03:48.124
you are charming,
and you're beautiful.

03:48.125 --> 03:52.301
I mean, surely you must
have friends, boyfriends.

03:52.302 --> 03:53.902
You really mean to tell
me that there's no one

03:53.903 --> 03:56.671
that warrants discussion here.

03:56.672 --> 03:59.344
I'm attracted
to the wrong kind of guy.

03:59.345 --> 04:00.810
I know.
Tale as old as time.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.279
Well, Cami, that's your tale,

04:02.280 --> 04:03.780
and part of
the therapeutic process

04:03.781 --> 04:05.220
is in the telling of it.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.784
There was this one guy.

04:10.785 --> 04:14.856
Smart, loyal, abs for days,
but I was his rebound girl,

04:14.857 --> 04:16.625
if I'm gonna be
honest with myself,

04:16.625 --> 04:21.264
and he was also...
Well, unique in ways

04:21.265 --> 04:24.202
that mean I should
probably stay away from him.

04:24.203 --> 04:26.234
- Unique?
- Just trust me on this one.

04:26.235 --> 04:27.736
We're not compatible.

04:27.737 --> 04:29.204
Now you said one guy.

04:29.205 --> 04:31.746
Am I to assume
that there are more?

04:34.144 --> 04:37.682
There was this other guy.

04:37.683 --> 04:40.249
Also unique.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.986
I mean, nothing ever
happened between us.

04:43.987 --> 04:48.292
He just got
under my skin, I guess.

04:48.293 --> 04:52.894
Manipulative mother,
abusive father,

04:52.895 --> 04:59.202
and under all that anger
and mistrust and cruelty,

04:59.203 --> 05:04.440
there was goodness in him, and
no matter how much I tried,

05:04.441 --> 05:06.708
I couldn't pretend
it wasn't there.

05:06.709 --> 05:09.279
You cared for him.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.717
You wanted to save him.

05:11.718 --> 05:15.794
So... what happened?

05:15.795 --> 05:18.360
Some people don't want
to be saved.

05:20.551 --> 05:24.265
Brother! Niklaus!

05:24.266 --> 05:26.169
You do realize that
literally everyone here

05:26.170 --> 05:27.891
has supernatural hearing, right?

05:27.892 --> 05:29.306
Where is my brother?

05:29.307 --> 05:30.440
Oh, I'll just...
I'll check his calendar.

05:30.441 --> 05:32.376
Wait. No.
Not his wife, so...

05:32.377 --> 05:35.580
Hayley, this city is uiser siege
by an army of beasts following

05:35.581 --> 05:37.014
my deranged mother's
every command.

05:37.015 --> 05:38.248
Now considering
it was your people

05:38.249 --> 05:39.783
who just declared
war on my kind,

05:39.784 --> 05:41.052
perhaps now's not the best time

05:41.053 --> 05:45.426
for your particular
brand of sass.

05:45.427 --> 05:47.295
Klaus left a while ago.

05:47.296 --> 05:49.621
If you want to find him,
I can't help you.

05:49.622 --> 05:52.832
If only there was
a magical device

05:52.833 --> 05:54.535
that people use to call people.

05:54.536 --> 05:56.236
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.

05:56.237 --> 05:57.737
Good luck.

05:58.707 --> 06:01.674
Oh, one more thing, Elijah.

06:01.675 --> 06:04.552
Those beasts that
you're referring to,

06:04.553 --> 06:06.650
they be under Esther's control,

06:06.651 --> 06:08.319
but like you said,
they're my people,

06:08.320 --> 06:11.121
so if you hurt them,
your bitch mother

06:11.122 --> 06:13.223
will be the least
of your problems.

06:25.096 --> 06:26.663
Finally, you pick up your phone.

06:26.664 --> 06:28.466
I've been trying to get
ahold of you for days.

06:28.467 --> 06:29.970
Way to leave a girl hanging.

06:29.971 --> 06:31.773
I know. I should
have called you back.

06:31.774 --> 06:33.276
I didn't want you to worry.

06:33.277 --> 06:34.777
I just...

06:34.778 --> 06:36.276
Things are complicated.

06:36.277 --> 06:37.810
Yeah, well, word
on the streets...

06:37.811 --> 06:39.143
And by streets, I mean Josh...

06:39.144 --> 06:40.312
Is that you've gone
totally M.I.A.

06:40.313 --> 06:41.980
Seriously, are you ok?
Where are you?

06:41.981 --> 06:44.182
I'm fine.
I'll be back soon, I promise,

06:44.183 --> 06:47.487
and... and thanks for calling.

06:47.488 --> 06:49.822
It's good to hear your voice.

06:49.823 --> 06:52.858
Davina? Davina?

06:52.859 --> 06:56.729
Well, that was rather rude.

06:56.730 --> 06:59.482
Well, it's a pleasure
to see you, too, Camille.

06:59.483 --> 07:03.536
Don't... don't do that
crooked smile thing, ok?

07:03.537 --> 07:05.005
I haven't seen you for months,

07:05.006 --> 07:07.043
and now you're appearing
out of the blue?

07:07.044 --> 07:08.712
What do you want?

07:08.713 --> 07:10.180
I have a rather
long list of people

07:10.181 --> 07:12.181
of people I need to
track down and deal with,

07:12.182 --> 07:15.685
and at the top of that list is
is a certain runaway witch.

07:15.851 --> 07:17.389
Maybe she doesn't
want to be found.

07:17.390 --> 07:18.491
And for good reason.

07:18.492 --> 07:20.026
Had I magically resurrected

07:20.027 --> 07:21.492
the insane
vampire-hunting father

07:21.493 --> 07:24.094
of my sworn enemy,
I'd be hiding, too.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.228
Wait. What?

07:25.229 --> 07:26.631
Oh, haven't you heard?

07:26.632 --> 07:28.668
Mikael the destroyer
back from the dead,

07:28.669 --> 07:30.405
and by all accounts under
the complete control

07:30.406 --> 07:32.475
of your little friend Davina.

07:32.476 --> 07:34.278
Well, you heard her clearly.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.852
She didn't say where she was.

07:35.853 --> 07:37.983
Oh, on the contrary, luv.

07:37.984 --> 07:40.687
You just had to know
how to listen.

07:40.688 --> 07:45.026
For instance, I heard
cicadas, and I heard terns,

07:45.027 --> 07:47.296
but the real giveaway
was the church bells.

07:47.297 --> 07:49.265
Did you know Davina's
family owns

07:49.266 --> 07:50.935
a little cabin
in Terrebonne Parish?

07:50.936 --> 07:52.660
It's been abandoned for years,

07:52.661 --> 07:54.708
but a brief glimpse
at a map shows

07:54.709 --> 07:59.247
it's just a mile from
the loveliest little chapel.

07:59.248 --> 08:00.782
So what's the plan?

08:00.783 --> 08:02.220
Well, the way I see it,
if Davina wants to use

08:02.221 --> 08:04.894
Mikael to kill me, we
just have two options.

08:04.895 --> 08:06.095
One, you reason with her.

08:06.096 --> 08:08.426
Two...

08:08.427 --> 08:10.632
I don't think you'd
like two very much.

08:13.132 --> 08:14.844
Fine. Let's go.

08:26.904 --> 08:29.747
Kol, concentrate.

08:29.748 --> 08:32.082
Unless of course
you've finally heard

08:32.082 --> 08:34.282
from our missing Davina Claire.

08:34.283 --> 08:36.328
Well, it's only
a matter of time.

08:36.330 --> 08:37.717
I mean, look at this face.

08:37.719 --> 08:39.707
How long can she
possibly resist?

08:39.707 --> 08:43.706
Given your progress,
I'd say indefinitely.

08:46.549 --> 08:48.787
No matter.

08:48.788 --> 08:50.489
I'll find her.

08:52.263 --> 08:53.630
Now focus.

08:53.631 --> 08:56.433
Conjure her in your mind.

09:06.209 --> 09:08.444
Clever girl.
She's somehow blocked

09:08.445 --> 09:10.071
our locator spells.

09:10.072 --> 09:11.943
Not entirely my fault then.

09:12.412 --> 09:14.247
Considering your sole task
was keeping track

09:14.248 --> 09:15.683
of a teenager,
you might want to draw

09:15.684 --> 09:19.330
a little less attention to your
absolute failure to do so.

09:19.331 --> 09:21.192
You're one to talk
about your failure.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.693
You got that human girl to bare

09:22.694 --> 09:24.826
her soul to you yet,
or are you too busy

09:24.827 --> 09:28.127
playing captain to a pack of
mangy dogs to have any success

09:28.128 --> 09:29.529
as a fake head shrinker?

09:29.530 --> 09:31.175
You know what
your problem is, Kol?

09:31.176 --> 09:32.734
- Oh, I would love to...
- Boys.

09:36.541 --> 09:40.975
Now if I'm right, Davina
has the white oak stake.

09:40.976 --> 09:44.267
Find the girl, Kol,
and get it back.

09:48.315 --> 09:49.986
You don't look so good.

09:49.987 --> 09:51.515
Those bites?

09:51.516 --> 09:56.367
Werewolf venom is to be purged
by force, not acquiesced to.

09:56.368 --> 09:58.457
And what is that, like,
a viking bumper sticker?

09:58.458 --> 10:02.490
Exactly how much longer are
we gonna be hiding here like cowards?

10:02.491 --> 10:03.708
Elijah saw you.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.762
If he knows you're here,
then Klaus does, too,

10:05.763 --> 10:07.365
so I'm sorry,
but until I unlink him

10:07.366 --> 10:10.089
from my friends,
you're stuck here with me.

10:10.090 --> 10:12.508
Confrontation
is inevitable, child.

10:12.509 --> 10:15.440
Your fear will prove to be
our greatest disadvantage.

10:15.441 --> 10:16.542
I'm not afraid.

10:16.543 --> 10:17.610
Well, you should be.

10:17.611 --> 10:18.743
You are weak.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.746
But I'm still in charge.

10:21.912 --> 10:26.731
By the way, I spelled it
while you were purging.

10:26.732 --> 10:28.858
It won't fall off again.

10:28.859 --> 10:31.322
Ah, yes.
Your magic.

10:31.323 --> 10:34.929
How well did that serve you
when the wolves attacked, hmm?

10:34.930 --> 10:39.994
Magic can only ever
fight half your battles.

10:39.995 --> 10:41.875
Remember that.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.293
Ok. Fine.

10:47.294 --> 10:51.568
You're so tough, teach me.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.489
Teach you what?

10:54.490 --> 10:57.954
How to be strong.

10:57.955 --> 10:59.223
We don't want to run.

10:59.224 --> 11:01.960
Look. I know,
and I respect that.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.160
But believe me,
there's a big difference

11:03.161 --> 11:05.763
between wanting to fight
and knowing how to win.

11:05.764 --> 11:06.928
So show us.

11:06.929 --> 11:08.296
You've kicked their ass before.

11:08.297 --> 11:09.731
I'm guessing you
didn't do it alone.

11:09.732 --> 11:12.066
Um, yeah. Not that I don't dig

11:12.067 --> 11:13.933
the whole "karate kid" vibe
that we got going on here,

11:13.934 --> 11:16.432
but how are we supposed
to learn to defend

11:16.433 --> 11:20.279
ourselves from an army of
superwolves in, like, one day?

11:26.709 --> 11:28.739
Lesson one.

11:28.740 --> 11:31.249
Always be on your guard.

11:42.141 --> 11:44.318
Well, I trust our message
was well-received.

11:44.319 --> 11:46.416
Loud and clear.
Those vampires should be

11:46.417 --> 11:47.584
gone by tomorrow.

11:47.585 --> 11:48.819
In my experience,
one can never be

11:48.820 --> 11:50.648
too careful with
these creatures,

11:50.649 --> 11:53.189
so we'll greet them
with superior numbers.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.059
Would you bring the recruits,
please sir?

11:56.060 --> 11:59.068
Oliver, Aiden, I have
a task for you.

12:04.413 --> 12:06.175
What's going on here?

12:06.176 --> 12:10.414
Tonight is luna sanguineus,
a blood moon.

12:10.919 --> 12:13.220
Now 1,000 years ago,
your people marked

12:13.221 --> 12:15.856
this celestial event
with a rite of passage,

12:15.857 --> 12:18.559
electing not to shrink
from their nature

12:18.560 --> 12:21.098
but to embrace it with pride

12:21.099 --> 12:24.974
by slaying a human being
and activating their curse.

12:24.975 --> 12:29.309
Tonight as unturned
wolves, you will kill

12:29.310 --> 12:31.147
with the singular purpose

12:31.148 --> 12:33.285
of unleashing that warrior
that lives within you.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.221
They're just
a bunch of kids.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.956
Aiden, we can no longer afford

12:36.957 --> 12:41.115
to hide our children
from the horrors of war.

12:41.116 --> 12:46.369
From now on, your either with
us, or you're against us.

12:48.472 --> 12:50.036
Come with me.

13:02.859 --> 13:05.389
What's that?

13:05.390 --> 13:08.332
The crest of our clan, a
reminder that we always carry

13:08.333 --> 13:11.474
the honor of our ancestors
before we go to battle.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.715
I wasn't ready.

13:17.716 --> 13:20.822
First lesson, always
be on your guard.

13:20.823 --> 13:22.150
It's heavy.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.552
I was half your age
the first time

13:23.553 --> 13:25.409
my father gave me the staff.

13:25.410 --> 13:27.119
I would have torn every muscle

13:27.120 --> 13:30.431
rather than let him see
me strain, and had I...

13:34.234 --> 13:36.087
He would have corrected me.

13:36.088 --> 13:38.209
No offense,
but your dad sounds like a jerkwad.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.744
Mothers love their children.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.297
Fathers make them strong.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.257
My mother tried to sacrifice me,

13:47.258 --> 13:50.346
and my dad took off
when I was born, so...

13:52.397 --> 13:53.896
You're anticipating.

13:53.897 --> 13:56.190
Do not let me see
your move before you make it.

13:56.191 --> 13:59.780
Unh!

13:59.781 --> 14:00.814
Get up.

14:00.815 --> 14:03.280
I can't. Unh.

14:03.281 --> 14:04.514
I hurt my ankle.

14:04.515 --> 14:07.317
The ability to endure pain is
the warrior's true weapon.

14:07.318 --> 14:14.250
Master that, and nothing
holds power over you.

14:14.251 --> 14:17.999
Now on your feet.

14:21.741 --> 14:23.743
I said...

14:23.744 --> 14:25.079
On...

14:25.080 --> 14:26.181
Your...

14:26.182 --> 14:27.592
Feet.

14:43.006 --> 14:45.364
Good.

14:45.365 --> 14:47.945
Perhaps you've actually
learned something today.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.827
"Wait in the car, you said.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.459
"I'll be right back," you said.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.499
Did I not sufficiently
explain to you

14:58.500 --> 15:00.536
the urgency of this endeavor?

15:00.537 --> 15:02.173
You're the one who hijacked
my afternoon to drag me along

15:02.174 --> 15:04.008
to this revenge fantasy
of yours.

15:04.009 --> 15:05.875
Excuse me if I need
a drink to take off the edge

15:05.876 --> 15:07.309
before the killing begins.

15:07.310 --> 15:08.554
So that's your plan, is it?

15:08.555 --> 15:11.278
Ply me with alcohol and then
prattle on until I'm convinced

15:11.279 --> 15:13.809
Davina and Mikael alone
to plot my death?

15:13.810 --> 15:16.938
No. My plan is to listen.

15:16.939 --> 15:18.487
Come on, Klaus.
You could have

15:18.488 --> 15:19.688
eavesdropped on
that phone call and vanished

15:19.689 --> 15:20.923
before I even knew
you were there,

15:20.924 --> 15:22.158
so let's just get
to the part you

15:22.159 --> 15:23.460
you really want me to play...

15:23.461 --> 15:26.330
Therapist, stenographer,
drinking buddy.

15:26.331 --> 15:27.598
Call it whatever you want.

15:27.599 --> 15:29.166
I know why I'm here.

15:29.167 --> 15:33.339
To give you the one
thing you've never had,

15:33.340 --> 15:35.451
someone to hear your side.

15:44.622 --> 15:45.925
So...

15:45.926 --> 15:48.396
You want to kill your father.

15:48.397 --> 15:51.676
Fine. Let's talk.

16:17.482 --> 16:19.685
Hi.

16:19.686 --> 16:22.378
Um, I'm sorry.
I know I haven't called in a while.

16:22.379 --> 16:25.291
Don't be silly, luv.
Are you all right?

16:25.292 --> 16:26.759
Where are you?

16:26.760 --> 16:30.136
Um, I'll text you the address

16:30.137 --> 16:32.265
and maybe a list
of things you can bring me.

16:32.266 --> 16:34.510
All right.
I'll be right there.

16:37.904 --> 16:40.072
As a devout feminist,
I refuse to say

16:40.073 --> 16:42.639
that you hit like a girl.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.676
So let's try this
again, shall we?

16:44.677 --> 16:46.645
Tell me again why
I don't get to be

16:46.646 --> 16:48.413
outside with everybody else,

16:48.414 --> 16:50.148
you know, with the nice teacher.

16:50.615 --> 16:52.199
You are my responsibility.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.220
Says the feminist.

16:55.221 --> 16:57.655
Fighting is rhythm.
There is a music,

16:57.656 --> 16:59.490
there is a meter,
there is a pattern.

16:59.491 --> 17:02.357
Let that rhythm beat within you.

17:02.358 --> 17:03.790
Again.

17:07.442 --> 17:09.294
Legato.

17:15.098 --> 17:16.097
Ostinato.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.019
Crescendo.

17:25.511 --> 17:29.565
And then once you've
established your cadence...

17:31.907 --> 17:33.617
You change the key.

17:33.618 --> 17:35.451
Very nice.

17:35.452 --> 17:40.623
Now the head or the heart?

17:40.624 --> 17:44.429
None of this means anything
if you cannot make the kill.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.829
What if I can't do it?

17:47.830 --> 17:52.599
You will to
survive.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.175
Now the head or the heart?

18:10.695 --> 18:11.899
Elijah.

18:17.548 --> 18:19.156
We need to talk.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.104
We're not here for a fight.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.223
Just hear him out.

18:30.054 --> 18:32.383
Speak.

18:32.384 --> 18:34.385
I suggest you be succinct.

18:34.386 --> 18:39.009
Please. I need your help.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.547
The witch wants soldiers.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.048
So now it's either join up
or pay the price.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.749
I've known my brother
Finn to be merciless.

18:54.750 --> 18:58.242
I'll admit this exceeds
even my expectations.

18:58.243 --> 18:59.521
They're just kids.

18:59.522 --> 19:01.754
Marcel, you know the quarter
like the back of your hand

19:01.755 --> 19:04.039
if anyone can get
them out of here, it's you.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.421
And take them where?

19:05.422 --> 19:07.090
There are still wolves
deep in the bayou,

19:07.091 --> 19:08.525
ones that didn't take a ring.

19:08.526 --> 19:09.861
They can look after them.

19:09.862 --> 19:11.799
The ones who never
sold out, you mean.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.906
If you want to look at it like that,
that's fine.

19:14.907 --> 19:17.940
We did what we had to do.

19:17.941 --> 19:20.576
You wolves have been
fighting us for decades.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.052
Why trust us now?

19:24.948 --> 19:28.651
One of the recruits
is my little brother.

19:28.652 --> 19:30.519
There's no way I'm
sending him to war.

19:36.959 --> 19:41.167
Tell us what you need.

19:41.168 --> 19:44.747
My mother's intentions are far
less savage than my father's.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.777
She'd prefer to place
us all in new bodies,

19:46.778 --> 19:49.913
there by reuniting
our family in some bizarre coven

19:49.914 --> 19:51.607
of extremely
dysfunctional witches.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.550
So, what,
are you just gonna kill her, too?

19:53.551 --> 19:56.958
If only I could,
but therein lies my predicament.

19:56.959 --> 20:00.387
If I kill her,
she'll just jump into another body,

20:00.388 --> 20:02.348
and if I somehow manage
to thwart that

20:02.349 --> 20:05.104
nasty little inconvenience,

20:05.105 --> 20:06.940
she'll rejoin the bloody
witch ancestors

20:06.941 --> 20:08.687
and haunt me from beyond.

20:08.688 --> 20:14.449
Right now, Mikael
has the white oak stake.

20:14.450 --> 20:16.153
He needs to die first.

20:16.154 --> 20:20.260
And how are you gonna
do that unarmed?

20:20.261 --> 20:23.999
I've taken precautions.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.068
Oh, goodie. Papa Tunde's
mystical knife

20:26.069 --> 20:27.236
of ludicrous torment.

20:27.237 --> 20:28.604
Glad that's still around.

20:28.605 --> 20:30.008
You know my parents
dedicated their lives

20:30.009 --> 20:32.628
to making me feel
weak and afraid.

20:32.629 --> 20:34.648
I've killed them once already.

20:34.649 --> 20:36.090
I can do it again.

20:36.091 --> 20:38.052
Klaus, wait.

20:38.053 --> 20:39.953
I get it.

20:39.954 --> 20:42.024
The hurt your parents
have inflicted on you

20:42.025 --> 20:44.765
for a thousand years, I understand
what you are fighting against,

20:44.766 --> 20:49.139
but the real question is
what are you fighting for?

20:51.982 --> 20:53.375
Ask me to dance.

20:53.376 --> 20:54.900
You want to dance?

20:54.901 --> 20:56.851
No. I never want to dance.

20:56.852 --> 20:58.052
I'm actually really bad at it,

20:58.053 --> 21:00.488
but I'm trying to make a point.

21:00.489 --> 21:03.409
There's more to life than the pain
that they made you feel.

21:03.410 --> 21:12.001
A cold beer, a slow
song, a good friend.

21:12.002 --> 21:14.670
There are good things, Klaus.

21:17.882 --> 21:20.081
And you need to see that, too.

21:36.836 --> 21:39.982
There's no real peace
in revenge.

22:08.016 --> 22:09.641
Yeah. I've read about this.

22:09.642 --> 22:12.590
I've never actually
seen it firsthand.

22:12.591 --> 22:14.123
It appears someone
has knocked you

22:14.124 --> 22:16.693
head over heels quite literally,

22:16.694 --> 22:18.712
and I thought I'd
have that honor.

22:18.878 --> 22:20.773
Hmm.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.366
Ugh! It smells like...

22:25.367 --> 22:27.744
The wrong end of something
quite dead, yeah.

22:27.745 --> 22:29.048
It's just a little
something I picked up

22:29.049 --> 22:32.354
from a shaman bloke in Uganda.

22:33.589 --> 22:35.690
There we go.

22:38.462 --> 22:40.031
Wow! The pain's just...

22:40.032 --> 22:42.702
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:44.671 --> 22:47.508
It's magic, right,
it's not a miracle.

22:51.642 --> 22:54.248
It's quite a spell
you've got going here.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.983
I mean, not to pry,
but I figured

22:55.984 --> 22:57.784
you had your secrets
after our last date ended

22:57.785 --> 22:59.358
in a werewolf bar brawl.

22:59.359 --> 23:01.856
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

23:01.857 --> 23:05.948
That's right. I never really
liked dull girls anyway.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.612
That said, what exactly
is going on here?

23:11.454 --> 23:13.966
You're still not
the trusting sort.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.644
Do you trust me?

23:19.645 --> 23:20.921
Are you slicked?

23:20.922 --> 23:25.149
Those sad eyes might fool
some people but not me.

23:25.150 --> 23:27.922
I know what you're after.

23:27.923 --> 23:30.342
You've got a lecherous
heart Davina Claire.

23:30.824 --> 23:33.787
I won't be used, not for my
body nor my medicinal herbs.

23:33.953 --> 23:37.495
We can hold hands, that's it.

23:37.496 --> 23:39.927
Whatever it is you're up to,

23:39.928 --> 23:42.146
well, you can tell me
when you're good and ready.

23:51.543 --> 23:53.277
Now the kids are being
held in the city of the dead

23:53.278 --> 23:54.511
until we bring them
through the quarter

23:54.512 --> 23:56.811
to St. Anne's church.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.709
Now meanwhile, Vincent
is holding a meeting

23:58.710 --> 23:59.875
with a few humans in the know,

23:59.876 --> 24:02.044
the ones who have been reluctant

24:02.045 --> 24:04.006
to fall in line
with his new leadership.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.949
He's going to use the children
to kill any opposition.

24:05.950 --> 24:07.517
Activate their curse,
send a message

24:07.518 --> 24:09.286
to anyone who's thinking
about going against him.

24:09.287 --> 24:12.222
It's two birds, one bloodbath.

24:12.223 --> 24:14.557
Ok. So we'll hit them while
the kids are on the move.

24:14.558 --> 24:17.659
Aiden, make certain you
and Oliver escort the children.

24:17.660 --> 24:18.826
We'll handle the rest.

24:18.827 --> 24:20.225
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.726
Esther and her psycho
sun are already

24:21.727 --> 24:23.461
giving me the stink-eye.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.496
These kids go missing on my watch,
I'm as good as dead.

24:25.497 --> 24:29.490
You wanted to help your people
and make amends for the past.

24:29.491 --> 24:32.001
This is your chance.

25:47.902 --> 25:52.284
What have we here, a
liar and a thief?

25:52.285 --> 25:53.574
I'm just looking about.

25:53.575 --> 25:55.021
Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't

25:55.022 --> 25:56.243
kill you right here!

25:56.244 --> 25:59.594
The bracelet the witch
uses to control you.

25:59.595 --> 26:01.693
I'm a witch.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.793
I know the magic to turn it off.

26:04.794 --> 26:07.165
You'll be free to do
whatever you want,

26:07.166 --> 26:10.335
provided you promise
not to harm me.

26:12.106 --> 26:13.606
Agh!

26:17.724 --> 26:20.053
I take it we have a deal.

26:58.063 --> 26:59.397
Watch it.

27:06.573 --> 27:08.440
You take the kids.

27:08.441 --> 27:10.274
Split up and find them!

27:13.347 --> 27:14.648
Listen up, listen up.
We got to go.

27:14.649 --> 27:15.883
Don't ask questions.
Just move.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.694
Come on. Go, go.

27:23.247 --> 27:24.889
Ollie, this way.

27:24.890 --> 27:26.258
Come on, come on.

27:34.832 --> 27:36.436
Go ahead.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.740
It's a passageway
from the prohibition days.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.940
It'll take us pretty much
anywhere we want to go.

27:59.169 --> 28:00.701
Where are they?

28:00.702 --> 28:02.452
They should be right behind me.

28:02.453 --> 28:04.511
Any minute now.

28:22.032 --> 28:24.204
Hey. Where's Marcel?

28:24.205 --> 28:25.640
Oh, he's getting
the getaway car.

28:25.641 --> 28:27.310
Hey, bigmouths.
Shut it.

28:27.311 --> 28:29.813
There are werewolves everywhere.

28:31.649 --> 28:34.985
Here we go.
About time.

28:38.022 --> 28:39.958
Don't bother trying to run.

28:39.959 --> 28:43.133
We've got you surrounded.

28:43.134 --> 28:45.503
What, you don't think that

28:45.504 --> 28:48.248
we would be dumb enough
to bring them here, do you?

28:48.249 --> 28:50.876
Yes. I do apologize
for any inconvenience.

28:50.877 --> 28:54.017
The little ones you seek
are elsewhere,

28:54.018 --> 28:59.596
which I suppose leaves
you here with me.

28:59.597 --> 29:01.865
You're the ones
that don't seem to understand.

29:01.866 --> 29:04.493
We're not looking for the kids.

29:04.659 --> 29:08.338
The witch wants you.

29:08.339 --> 29:11.713
You listen to me very carefully.

29:11.714 --> 29:15.218
I told a good friend
I'd do my very best

29:15.219 --> 29:17.402
to spare the lives
of her people.

29:17.403 --> 29:21.295
You leave right now,
I will honor that.

29:21.296 --> 29:26.823
Stay, and the situation
becomes irrefutably awkward.

29:32.141 --> 29:34.409
Very well.

29:34.410 --> 29:36.625
You should probably leave.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.171
Either I'm in,
or I'm out, right?

29:48.794 --> 29:50.727
Let's go. Move.

29:56.436 --> 29:58.939
Nick.

29:58.940 --> 30:00.741
Aiden, you made it.

30:00.742 --> 30:02.322
Of course I did.

30:02.323 --> 30:04.636
Told you I'd be here, didn't I?

30:04.802 --> 30:06.988
Go.

30:14.752 --> 30:17.754
Thank you, both of you.

30:17.755 --> 30:19.666
No problem.

30:19.667 --> 30:22.501
We're all fighting for the same thing,
you know?

30:22.502 --> 30:24.756
Just trying to protect
he ones that we love.

30:46.492 --> 30:48.484
Well, I guess that's
all they got.

30:48.485 --> 30:51.288
So it would seem.

30:51.289 --> 30:53.485
Unh!

30:53.486 --> 30:57.389
Actually, I'm just
getting started.

31:03.175 --> 31:05.160
Perhaps your next body
will last a little longer

31:05.161 --> 31:06.562
than this one, brother.

31:06.563 --> 31:09.598
Unh!

31:09.599 --> 31:10.974
Ugh! No.

31:36.167 --> 31:38.518
You phone is chockfull of texts.

31:38.519 --> 31:40.290
Who's... who's Cami?

31:45.628 --> 31:47.422
Come with me now.

33:23.059 --> 33:24.559
Aah!

33:29.266 --> 33:31.406
Enough games, Davina!

33:31.407 --> 33:33.491
Send out my father.

33:33.492 --> 33:36.348
Let's finish this.

33:36.514 --> 33:41.791
Release me,
or I will kill you right now!

33:41.792 --> 33:44.377
Davina!

33:44.378 --> 33:47.317
Is this not what
you brought him for?

33:47.318 --> 33:48.520
I'm not afraid!

34:17.458 --> 34:19.991
Hello... boy.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.375
You seem rather impatient.

34:24.376 --> 34:26.460
Are you so eager
to meet your end?

34:26.462 --> 34:31.074
I'm only eager to stand over
your burning corpse again.

34:31.074 --> 34:34.342
Only this time,
I intend to enjoy it more.

34:36.112 --> 34:43.094
I've traveled all the way back
from hell for this moment.

34:43.094 --> 34:45.161
Well, then I'd hate
to keep you waiting.

35:02.832 --> 35:04.244
Aagh! Aagh!

35:09.260 --> 35:10.583
Hyah!

35:22.451 --> 35:24.822
Aah!

35:24.823 --> 35:27.290
Aaaugh!

36:07.911 --> 36:09.480
Where is she?
If something happened

36:09.481 --> 36:11.377
to her, Klaus, I swear to God!

36:11.543 --> 36:13.251
Davina's fine. She'll wake
with a spectacular headache,

36:13.252 --> 36:14.685
but given her intentions for me,

36:14.686 --> 36:16.852
she should count herself lucky.

36:18.820 --> 36:20.588
Of course if you drop
dead of a heart attack,

36:20.589 --> 36:22.890
I may have to kill her
on general principle.

36:22.891 --> 36:25.158
You're the one who
ditched me at the bar.

36:25.159 --> 36:27.394
I had to hitchhike and then run

36:27.395 --> 36:29.529
on the back roads of the bayou!

36:29.530 --> 36:31.764
Well, your perseverance
is duly is noted.

36:31.765 --> 36:33.066
Oh, shut up.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.131
I am so mad at you,
I can hardly speak,

36:35.132 --> 36:37.550
but I am here,
and it is to tell you...

36:37.551 --> 36:39.508
Not to bargain with you
and not to shame you

36:39.509 --> 36:42.011
but to tell you
under no circumstances

36:42.012 --> 36:44.947
will you hurt that girl,
do you understand me?

36:44.948 --> 36:46.949
You have my word.

37:00.061 --> 37:04.133
Is that Mikael?
Is he...

37:04.134 --> 37:08.971
He's still alive and in
complete and utter agony.

37:08.972 --> 37:13.790
I decided to take your advice
and keep him that way.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.503
Didn't think you
were gonna show.

37:55.504 --> 37:58.131
Didn't think you were a vampire.

37:58.132 --> 38:04.055
Ditto on the whole leader
of a werewolf army thing.

38:07.184 --> 38:11.153
P.S. these pictures don't
really do you justice.

38:11.154 --> 38:14.526
You're way hotter in person,

38:14.527 --> 38:18.063
you know, when you're
not murdering people.

38:18.064 --> 38:20.535
You know, I shouldn't have come.

38:20.536 --> 38:21.971
Yeah...

38:23.810 --> 38:27.714
But you did.

38:27.715 --> 38:31.487
Why?

38:31.488 --> 38:34.061
I guess I hoped seeing you

38:34.062 --> 38:37.098
might make me feel
a little less...

38:37.099 --> 38:41.027
I don't know...
Alone.

38:48.976 --> 38:53.078
Ok. Look. Maybe for tonight,

38:53.079 --> 38:56.552
we could pretend
things are different.

38:56.553 --> 38:59.524
I'm not a vampire,
you're not a wolf,

38:59.525 --> 39:04.730
the city isn't about to implode.

39:04.731 --> 39:09.470
We could just...
I don't know...

39:09.471 --> 39:11.235
Be ourselves.

39:14.774 --> 39:16.496
I'd like that.

39:28.399 --> 39:29.931
Well, we did it.

39:29.932 --> 39:33.142
I never thought I'd see
the day when "we" meant us.

39:33.143 --> 39:34.476
Well, you're a vampire now.

39:34.477 --> 39:38.413
First rule is never say never
because never ain't that long,

39:38.414 --> 39:42.150
and what we did today,
it was the right thing,

39:42.151 --> 39:43.284
but, you know, it's
gonna make things worse

39:43.285 --> 39:45.029
between your people and mine.

39:45.030 --> 39:48.155
There's a life lesson
for you, baby vamp.

39:48.156 --> 39:51.261
It always gets worse
before it gets better.

40:00.474 --> 40:03.042
We left Elijah out there.

40:05.246 --> 40:07.980
Look. I worry about
a lot of things

40:07.981 --> 40:12.620
where Elijah's
concerned, but trust me.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.887
He can take care of himself.

41:34.548 --> 41:36.719
What do you want?

41:36.720 --> 41:40.621
I only want us to be
a family again, Elijah,

41:40.622 --> 41:44.649
but I'm so sorry.

41:44.650 --> 41:50.131
In order for that to happen,
you must be purified.
