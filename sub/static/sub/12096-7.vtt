<i>This is the story of two sisters:</i>

00:08.360 --> 00:11.592
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:11.840 --> 00:16.357
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.560 --> 00:18.119
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:18.320 --> 00:21.199
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.400 --> 00:23.756
<i>is that she would set it all</i>
<i>to music.</i>

00:25.320 --> 00:28.950
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.560 --> 00:34.758
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.560 --> 00:38.153
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:38.360 --> 00:42.195
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.400 --> 00:45.677
<i>As you can see, the Campbells</i>
<i>don't have nearly as much money</i>

<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap,
<i>Jessica apologised to Corinne</i>

00:59.640 --> 01:01.393
<i>for having an affair with Peter.</i>

01:01.640 --> 01:03.597
<i>But Corinne refused</i>
<i>to forgive her mother</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:06.360

Well, he's your father, Jessica.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.560
Where is he?
Well, Chester,
I... I... I don't...

01:51.760 --> 01:53.479
Benson. Benson.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.115
Benson, where is he?

01:56.320 --> 01:59.392
Wonderful.
Just wonderful.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.991
I kill myself in the kitchen
all day and then nobody eats.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.759
Benson.
Look at this.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.758
Not one plate touched.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.512
Well, let's not waste
all this good food.
Let's invite the Campbells over.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.189
They can throw it around.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.872
Benson, one of the reasons
we're not eating is because

02:18.080 --> 02:21.039
we are all worried and upset
about The Major's disappearance.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.711
And The Major would not
have disappeared if you
had been watching him.

02:24.920 --> 02:28.914
It ain't my job to watch him.
The less I see of him, the better.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.516
Benson, when was
the last time you saw him?

02:31.720 --> 02:32.756
I saw him this morning.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.520
He was running around
in that camouflage outfit of his,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.155
terrorising the gardener.

02:38.960 --> 02:39.960
Then he left.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.675
Did he say
where he was going, Benson?

02:42.920 --> 02:44.991
On patrol.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.113
Well, what does that mean?

02:47.320 --> 02:49.960
It means Grandpa's bonkers.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.830
It means, Jessica,
that he's gotten himself
into one hell of a fix again,

02:54.040 --> 02:55.474
that's what it means.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.514
It means, Jessica,
that in the course of 24 hours,

02:58.720 --> 03:02.316
your daughter has left home,
and your father has disappeared.

03:02.560 --> 03:06.156
It means that perhaps
you are letting this household
get the better of you.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.313
Oh, it's not her fault.
She's not responsible for the...

03:09.520 --> 03:11.398
Benson.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.398
You are sitting at the table.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.358
Good, Mr. Tate.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.354
And this is standing.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.837
And this is leaving.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.515
Jessica, do you remember
the last time your father
disappeared?

03:30.720 --> 03:35.272
Do you remember how
he took the 8:12 commuter train
into Manhattan

03:35.480 --> 03:38.712
and attacked
the German consulate?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.998
It caused
an international incident,
Jessica.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.398
I had to apologise
to two governments.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.080
And remember on December 7th,

03:47.280 --> 03:50.956
when he captured the entire staff
of Benihana's of Tokyo?

03:51.160 --> 03:52.833
[LAUGHING]

03:53.280 --> 03:57.240
It cost me a fortune
to keep him out of the
banana hatch that time, Jessica.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.079
At ease, men.
JESSICA: Oh, Daddy.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.920
There he is, Chester.
Where the devil have you been?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.156
Easy, colonel.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.718
I think your anger will be
assuaged when you see
what I have brought you.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.118
There he is.
One of the Nazi's
top spies.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.392
God, it's Mr. Kirby.
Oh, dear.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.637
Are you crazy?
This is Mr. Kirby,
our neighbour.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.798
Don't let him fool you.
He's a master of disguise.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.469
Mr. Kirby, I am...
I'm so sorry.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.639
Tate...
How about a nice glass
of iced tea, Mr. Kirby?

04:26.840 --> 04:28.797
I have had it, Tate.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.277
No, not a word.
Don't say a word. There is
nothing you can say to me, Tate.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.312
There is nothing
you can say to a man

04:34.520 --> 04:37.957
who has spent an
entire afternoon locked
in the trunk of his car.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.550
Oh. What man
was locked in the
trunk of his car?

04:40.760 --> 04:45.312
It isn't... It isn't enough
that I occasionally
get shot at.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.592
No, today... Today
I get into my car, and
halfway down the street

04:48.800 --> 04:51.156
a gun was placed
at the back of my head.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.840
I hid in the back seat.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.759
Some cold lemonade?

04:54.960 --> 04:55.996
I was then ord...

04:57.880 --> 05:00.679
I was then ordered
to drive out
to the city dump where...

05:00.880 --> 05:02.792
Where he proceeded
to grill me for hours

05:03.000 --> 05:04.878
about troop movements
on the Heifetz River.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.839
Yes, heh.
KIRBY:
I showed him my licence,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.112
My credit cards even,
to prove I was an American.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.994
I kept yelling out
of the trunk of the car,
"Corn Flakes,

05:13.200 --> 05:17.035
McDonald's,
Reggie Jackson,
toilet paper."

05:17.240 --> 05:20.233
I sang the
"Star-Spangled Banner,"
but he wouldn't believe me.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.874
Of course I didn't believe you.

05:22.080 --> 05:27.519
He couldn't tell me
who played third base
for the Yankees in 1931.

05:27.720 --> 05:28.870
Tell him, colonel.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.271
He doesn't know, you idiot.

So that's it, Tate.

I'm going on record
right now, I swear,
if I ever catch that lunatic

I'll have him put away.

KIRBY: No.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.918
Will you try and understand?

05:51.120 --> 05:57.390
One more incident and
they are going to lock you up
and put you away.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.040
Yes, colonel.

I'll find out all their secrets,

and lead our boys
to safety.

Good thinking, colonel.

Hey. You don't leave
that riveting gun there,

What are you
trying to do?
Kill somebody?

Last time somebody left
something like that
laying around, it fell.

Knocked a hole
in a guy's head the size of
the Grand Canyon.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.670
Of course, the size
of the hole in his head
was relatively unimportant

07:24.880 --> 07:27.918
since he went
crashing down
700 feet anyway.

Yes, Chester.
What are you papering the walls in?

there is a solution to all this.

Wait?
That's right, wait.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.514
Remember 10 years ago, Chester?

09:56.720 --> 09:59.120
Remember when you said
you couldn't leave
because little Billy

09:59.200 --> 10:01.396
had a perception problem,
and if you left then,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.434
then he might write backwards
for the rest of his life.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.034
So I waited.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.556
And then that cleared up,
and Billy could read

10:08.760 --> 10:11.798
but suddenly Eunice wouldn't
get out of her bathrobe
or leave her room

10:12.000 --> 10:13.878
and you couldn't leave then.

So I waited.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.115
And then,
as soon as Eunice got dressed,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.960
Corinne stopped eating
and had to be hospitalised

22:14.920 --> 22:17.276
Danny, uh,
what are you doing
up the chimney?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.039
Cleaning out the flue.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.994
Cleaning out the flue?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.634
Funny guy.
Walks into a cabin,

22:23.840 --> 22:26.400
goes right up the chimney,
cleans out a flue.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
Eh, that could be
a safety precaution.
I don't know.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.720
[THUD]

22:29.880 --> 22:31.280
DANNY: Hey, don't touch that.
BURT: What is it?

22:31.480 --> 22:33.790
DANNY: Nothing. Just leave it alone.
It just fell down the chimney.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.639
I know it fell.
Yeah, what's in it?

22:35.840 --> 22:38.480
Nothing. I need it,
though. Give it to me,
Burt.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.797
I found it.
All right. All right, all right.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.036
From the looks of this place,
it's probably garbage.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.640
Funny, you think
you know somebody.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.753
At home, your room's
a mess, you throw food
all over the kitchen.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.078
We go away for the
weekend, you turn out
to be Louis Pasteur.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.920
Hey, Danny,
you're full of surprises.

22:57.440 --> 23:01.116
Uh, Danny, that's a gun.
Put it down,
that's dangerous.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.709
Uh, Danny,
what are you doing?
You're pointing a gun at me.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.195
I'm gonna kill you, Burt.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.470
Pfft. Heh-heh.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.797
That's funny. Oh.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.037

23:17.360 --> 23:18.360

23:18.520 --> 23:21.592
