00:06.110 --> 00:07.900
[Clary] <i>Previously
on</i> Shadowhunters...

00:07.990 --> 00:11.330
[Cleophas] <i>The Soul-Sword would destroy
demon-blooded creatures in its path.</i>

00:11.410 --> 00:12.910
<i>If Valentine has the angel...</i>

00:12.990 --> 00:14.820
[Clary] <i>He can activate
the Soul-Sword.</i>

00:16.910 --> 00:19.620
Children have a way of making
us terribly vulnerable.

00:19.710 --> 00:22.550
Don't hurt her.
I will do anything you ask.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.896
Someone has taken my spell book.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.750
What does Valentine
want with my spells?

00:26.840 --> 00:29.470
All he said was that I
had to get them for him.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.800
And I wasn't to harm Clary.

00:30.890 --> 00:33.140
You made a blood oath.
Find Madzie.

00:35.390 --> 00:37.150
Clary may have pure angel blood.

00:37.220 --> 00:39.680
That's why Valentine
wants Clary unharmed.

00:39.770 --> 00:41.280
Clary can activate
the Soul-Sword.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.390
Whoa! [Chuckles]

01:11.680 --> 01:13.470
This is so weird.

01:13.550 --> 01:16.590
[stammers] Yeah. Are my fangs in the way?
Because I can totally, um...

01:16.680 --> 01:18.076
[Clary] No, no, you're fine.
You're fine...

01:18.100 --> 01:19.956
- It's just the canoe's a little small to...
- Yeah.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.860
- Ow! [Laughs]
- Ooh, careful. [Chuckling]

01:21.940 --> 01:23.150
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.190
[both laughing]

01:29.030 --> 01:32.330
I cannot believe I let
you talk me into this.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.280
[chuckles] Me neither.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.360
[Clary grunts]

01:39.200 --> 01:40.370
It's okay. I got you.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.990
Oh, great. In that case,
we'll just go down together.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.500
Well, I mean...

01:46.130 --> 01:48.050
I'm pretty sure this
thing is untippable.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.720
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.140
Well, I'll just have
to see about that.

01:53.890 --> 01:55.850
Oh! Okay...

02:01.310 --> 02:02.310
[both laughing]

02:15.160 --> 02:17.790
- [horn blows]
- [both grunt]

02:20.450 --> 02:22.570
- Jace. Hey.
- [chuckles]

02:22.660 --> 02:26.000
What the hell are you doing? I...
You know what? Don't answer that.

02:27.420 --> 02:28.510
Here you go.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.850
Jace, it's okay. I'm safe here.

02:40.970 --> 02:42.390
Until Valentine
stops hunting you,

02:42.470 --> 02:44.260
the only place you're
safe is the Institute.

02:44.350 --> 02:46.770
Really? I'm not sure you
actually know how hiding works.

02:46.850 --> 02:50.350
The whole point is to, um,
not be where everyone thinks you are.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.900
Trust me, I'm kind of an expert.

02:52.990 --> 02:55.240
For an expert,
you were pretty easy to find.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.950
Just be thankful I got to
you before the Circle did.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.230
[Simon] I'm not afraid of them.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.306
I've been working on
my fighting skills.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.040
[scoffs] Oh, really?

03:03.660 --> 03:06.450
You wanna take this outside and
give these fight skills a test run?

03:06.540 --> 03:07.950
Anytime.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.750
As soon as the sun goes down.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.620
Guys, I can handle my...

03:12.710 --> 03:14.040
- [skin burning]
- [yelps]

03:14.130 --> 03:15.790
- What the hell?
- [Jace] What's wrong?

03:15.880 --> 03:17.200
[breathing heavily]
I don't know.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.180
[Simon] What is that?

03:21.850 --> 03:24.020
[gasping]

03:50.420 --> 03:53.300
How many Downworlders do
you think live in New York?

03:53.380 --> 03:56.550
{\an8}I don't know, but they're
not all your responsibility.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.090
{\an8}But you are.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.050
{\an8}-I can take care of myself.
- Maybe... but this is different.

04:04.970 --> 04:07.140
{\an8}You may have lived
through the fall of Rome,

04:07.230 --> 04:10.530
{\an8}but even the Dark Ages
couldn't have been this dark.

04:11.770 --> 04:15.650
{\an8}Alexander...
I know things may seem bleak, but...

04:17.149 --> 04:20.190
{\an8}nothing was as devastating as
seeing you standing on that ledge.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.740
{\an8}-It was the magic. I would never, never...
- I know, I know.

04:24.910 --> 04:28.950
{\an8}But magic can't create
fears, only bring them out.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.806
{\an8}-Magnus...
- Look, you don't have to explain yourself.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.870
{\an8}I've been through it myself.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.880
{\an8}Just promise you'll tell me
if things ever get that bad.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.020
{\an8}[door opens]

04:45.350 --> 04:46.900
Don't you people have phones?

04:46.970 --> 04:48.610
- [breathing heavily]
- We need your help.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.450
<i>La Chair BrÃ»lÃ©e.</i>

05:01.110 --> 05:02.820
I'm guessing that's
not a dessert.

05:02.910 --> 05:05.960
It means "the burnt flesh."
It's an old blood oath spell.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.790
Then it must be Iris.

05:07.870 --> 05:09.710
She said you owed her a favor.

05:09.790 --> 05:12.500
At Max's party,
she said I have to find Madzie.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.120
[Magnus] Then we
better start looking.

05:14.210 --> 05:16.290
I can get rid of the
pain, but that's about it.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.350
{\an8}I'm afraid once the magic
reaches your heart...

05:22.130 --> 05:23.880
So if I don't find Madzie...

05:26.850 --> 05:28.270
I'm dead.

05:28.350 --> 05:31.980
No... no.
Magnus, there has to be a cure.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.980
{\an8}There has to be something
we can do to stop this.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.310
{\an8}Can't we force Iris to undo it?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.240
{\an8}[Magnus] I wish
it were that easy.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.370
{\an8}But blood oath spells
are completely binding.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.770
Even Iris herself
can't reverse it now.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.950
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.340
{\an8}Isabelle, you look... recovered.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.880
{\an8}I'm impressed.

06:02.970 --> 06:05.251
{\an8}It takes most people weeks to
wean themselves off <i>yin fen.</i>

06:06.010 --> 06:09.680
{\an8}Well, I'm not most people.
You wanted to ask me something?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.780
Do you have plans tonight?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.450
[scoffs] Excuse me?

06:23.530 --> 06:26.040
{\an8}I was wondering if you'd
like to join me for dinner.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.000
{\an8}[chuckles] Um...

06:29.080 --> 06:31.460
I'm sorry.
Are you asking me out?

06:31.540 --> 06:34.130
[chuckles] I just wanted
to express my gratitude

06:34.210 --> 06:36.290
for how well you kept the
Institute while I was away.

06:36.330 --> 06:39.250
No thanks necessary.
I had nothing to do with it.

06:41.090 --> 06:42.340
But I insist.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.720
If not tonight,
how about tomorrow?

06:47.300 --> 06:48.630
Sorry.

07:03.860 --> 07:04.980
I don't know what to say.

07:06.740 --> 07:08.910
{\an8}I was so selfish,
hiding in the woods like that.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.216
{\an8}You would have never
went to Iris if...

07:10.240 --> 07:12.030
{\an8}Luke, this has nothing
to do with you.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.300
{\an8}You always told me to read the fine print.
Well, I guess, uh, now I know why.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.970
- Magnus find anything?
- No.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.960
Iris' brownstone was wiped clean,
but Alec just got a report from the Clave.

07:24.050 --> 07:26.680
According to Iris,
Madzie was abducted from Brady Park.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.890
{\an8}All right, we'll start there.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.116
{\an8}I'll round up some wolves and
see if we can get a scent.

07:31.140 --> 07:33.900
{\an8}-Great. Hey. Where are you going?
- To get Simon.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.970
If we're gonna be searching all
night, we can use his skills.

07:38.980 --> 07:39.990
What skills?

07:40.560 --> 07:43.940
- I don't know... night vision.
- There's a rune for that.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.270
Too bad. He's coming.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.160
I need him.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.130
{\an8}Are you awake in there?
Incoming sunlight.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.060
{\an8}[wolf growling]

08:15.140 --> 08:16.260
[snarling]

08:21.230 --> 08:22.810
[Simon] Clary?

08:25.280 --> 08:26.620
[growling]

08:30.160 --> 08:31.160
- Clary!
- [skin sizzling]

08:32.990 --> 08:34.030
[groans]

08:42.080 --> 08:43.250
Back off! [Grunts]

08:43.340 --> 08:44.340
[whimpers]

08:46.000 --> 08:47.316
- Nice form.
- [breathing heavily]

08:47.340 --> 08:49.470
{\an8}Five summers at
Camp Winnipesaukee.

08:50.590 --> 08:52.590
[bones cracking]

08:55.310 --> 08:56.520
Show yourself!

09:03.480 --> 09:04.810
[sighs]

09:16.200 --> 09:17.950
[Luke] What the hell
were you thinking?

09:18.870 --> 09:20.660
I know about the Soul-Sword.

09:20.750 --> 09:23.300
I was there at the party.
I heard everything.

09:23.380 --> 09:26.720
- If Clary touches it, we're all dead!
- And that gives you the right to kill her?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.390
You think this is easy?
You know me.

09:29.470 --> 09:31.696
- You know I don't want to hurt anybody!
- [Simon] Really?

09:31.720 --> 09:33.180
That's not what it looked like.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.980
One life versus millions.

09:37.060 --> 09:40.230
If killing Clary is the price
of saving the entire Downworld,

09:40.310 --> 09:41.480
then I'm willing to pay it.

09:41.560 --> 09:45.480
- She has to die.
- That is not your decision to make.

09:55.740 --> 09:56.740
Simon...

10:00.250 --> 10:01.290
I'm sorry.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.710
Save it.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.890
[Jace] You okay?
[Clary] I can feel it spreading.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.680
What if Maia's right?

10:16.550 --> 10:17.670
[Luke] She's not.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.930
- You need to find Madzie.
- [Simon] No problem.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.520
We'll take the van.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.240
- Luke?
- I gotta stay here.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.876
If Maia told the rest of the wolves
what that Sword is capable of,

10:30.900 --> 10:31.980
you're in serious danger.

10:32.070 --> 10:34.200
- But, Luke...
- No time to argue.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.690
Word travels fast.

10:35.780 --> 10:39.200
I'll catch up... after I stop the
Downworld from coming after you.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.000
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.170
Hey.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.550
- If anything happens to her...
- It won't.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.900
- Trust me, I'll protect her.
- We'll protect her.

11:03.810 --> 11:05.110
Just try to keep up.

11:06.690 --> 11:08.360
Who does he think is driving?

11:13.860 --> 11:15.110
[maniacal laughter]

11:16.360 --> 11:17.780
[hissing]

11:36.170 --> 11:38.340
I thought you said you
knew how this worked.

11:38.430 --> 11:41.850
I'm trying,
but the injections...

11:42.640 --> 11:45.190
I can barely generate enough
magic to create your Portals,

11:45.270 --> 11:46.860
let alone a spell this complex.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.110
Then perhaps you can teach her.

11:51.150 --> 11:54.450
- No, she's too young.
- But powerful beyond her years.

11:54.530 --> 11:56.450
By raising Madzie myself,

11:56.530 --> 12:01.080
I'll finally have a warlock
that's unconditionally loyal.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.680
Do you like your new
home, sweetheart?

12:04.410 --> 12:06.830
I found it just for you.

12:07.870 --> 12:12.460
And if you help me,
I promise to help you find your nana.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.500
See? Madzie wants to help.

12:17.590 --> 12:21.210
That is, unless you'd rather
I give her the injections.

12:23.890 --> 12:25.770
- No.
- Good.

12:25.850 --> 12:27.690
Then I'll leave you two
to get acquainted, huh?

12:31.650 --> 12:32.860
[sighs]

12:34.650 --> 12:39.400
Hi, Madzie. I'm Dot.
It's nice to meet you.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.040
You're pretty.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.400
[chuckles]

12:43.910 --> 12:45.170
[sighs]

12:48.250 --> 12:49.436
[Alec] Do you know
where Izzy is?

12:49.460 --> 12:51.096
I was told you spoke
with her this morning.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.356
She hasn't been in
the Institute since.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.010
I didn't realize I was the
keeper of your sister's calendar.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.090
Something's wrong.

12:56.170 --> 12:59.550
She's been acting weird ever since
you sent her to the Iron Sisters.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.090
I think you're being paranoid.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.736
After what happened at
your brother's party,

13:02.760 --> 13:04.826
perhaps I should recommend
you for a psych evaluation.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.270
[grunts]

13:06.350 --> 13:08.350
What reason would I have to lie?

13:08.430 --> 13:11.970
- I don't know, but whatever it is...
- Nothing's going on.

13:12.060 --> 13:15.520
I'm just trying to help.
Now, I would ask yourself...

13:16.650 --> 13:20.230
is making insinuations about me
really the road you want to go down?

13:22.910 --> 13:25.710
Isabelle's more than
capable of handling herself.

13:28.870 --> 13:31.740
Come on... have a taste.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.120
Delicious.

13:34.210 --> 13:37.550
Although, I think it could use
a little more salsa picante.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.380
Um, a little less.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.350
Start spreading the
masa onto the husk.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.470
That's the filling.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.610
- Wait. Aren't they both filling?
- No.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.680
This is the masa.

13:54.770 --> 13:56.940
And this is the filling.

13:58.860 --> 14:02.450
[scoffs] But they both
fill the corn leaf. You...

14:03.360 --> 14:04.400
May I?

14:20.380 --> 14:23.920
You know, for a vampire,
you're a pretty good cook.

14:24.010 --> 14:26.680
I should be.
I cook every Sunday.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.020
Not for myself, I...

14:30.850 --> 14:33.940
drop meals off at a Catholic
retirement home in Harlem.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.780
I didn't take you for a
community service kind of guy.

14:38.570 --> 14:39.570
I'm not.

14:41.490 --> 14:43.070
My little sister lives there.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.690
She's 78.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.620
She can't remember who I am.

14:49.740 --> 14:51.870
Yet I can't forget about her.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.280
I didn't know.

14:55.420 --> 14:56.800
Nobody knows.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.470
Except for you.

15:02.260 --> 15:05.680
I'm sorry, I... I said too much.
I should keep my mouth shut.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.970
No.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.980
I rather you didn't.

15:15.890 --> 15:17.140
[hissing]

15:21.440 --> 15:22.810
[breathing heavily]

15:29.070 --> 15:30.360
[moaning]

15:48.090 --> 15:49.970
Don't make this any
harder than it already is.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.260
Who else knows about Clary?
What she's capable of?

15:57.100 --> 15:59.520
I don't know. Everybody?

15:59.610 --> 16:02.650
I mean, you're too late, Luke.
The secret's out.

16:02.730 --> 16:05.730
[sighs] I'm sorry.
I... [sniffles]

16:05.820 --> 16:08.080
I know what I did was wrong.
I did it just because I...

16:08.150 --> 16:10.610
- I... I was really scared.
- That doesn't change anything.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.500
Locking me up in here doesn't really
change anything, either. I mean...

16:14.540 --> 16:16.426
You've seen my file.
You know what I've been through.

16:16.450 --> 16:19.790
- You know I get claustrophobic.
- I know.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.670
But I'm doing this
for your own safety.

16:23.340 --> 16:24.646
I don't want to
have to fight you.

16:24.670 --> 16:28.130
- Me? All you care about is Clary!
- That's not true.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.776
You know that you're
like family to me, too.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.760
Then why am I in here
and she's out there?

16:34.260 --> 16:37.720
Luke, I promise you,
I will not hurt Clary, just...

16:37.810 --> 16:39.650
please don't leave me in here.

16:44.270 --> 16:48.360
- I'm sorry, I have no choice.
- Luke, Luke. Please, please, please.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.200
[Luke sighs]

16:53.200 --> 16:55.170
[reporter speaking
indistinctly on radio]

16:59.580 --> 17:01.160
I thought you were different.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.945
[Clary] Are you sure this is
the park Alec was talking about?

17:14.970 --> 17:16.890
[Jace] Positive.
See the scorched grass?

17:16.970 --> 17:18.589
Someone opened a Portal.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.349
[grunts]

17:22.560 --> 17:23.980
[Simon] Nothing over there.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.796
And without the wolves to
help us pick up a scent,

17:25.819 --> 17:27.546
- this is gonna take forever.
- [Clary sighs]

17:27.569 --> 17:30.580
We don't have forever.
Everyone keep looking.

17:32.490 --> 17:33.620
Maybe he can help.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.160
Excuse me, um...

17:37.240 --> 17:39.570
a little girl might have gotten
kidnapped a few days ago.

17:39.660 --> 17:40.886
I was wondering if
you've seen her.

17:40.910 --> 17:43.950
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- [Clary] Are you sure?

17:44.040 --> 17:47.960
She's about this tall, pigtails, always...
wears a scarf.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.340
Hey, where'd you get that scarf?

17:52.430 --> 17:55.810
Nowhere. I found it. It's mine.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.140
Do you wanna make a trade?

18:03.560 --> 18:04.810
[grunts]

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
What?

18:12.650 --> 18:15.650
Keep heading north. The signal's
faint, but we can still track her.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.360
Don't sound too excited.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.490
- It's too easy.
- It wasn't easy.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.266
That jacket's at least two
sizes small on that guy.

18:21.290 --> 18:22.540
I'm just a great salesman.

18:22.620 --> 18:25.540
Valentine's too smart to have not
thought about blocking the signal.

18:25.630 --> 18:28.630
If we can track Madzie,
it's because he wants us to.

18:28.710 --> 18:30.290
We'll be walking into a trap.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.290
What are you suggesting?
That we don't find Madzie?

18:33.380 --> 18:36.090
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Simon's right.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.730
Trap or no trap,
the scarf is our only option.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.190
[stammers] I can't let Valentine
activate the Soul-Sword, either.

18:45.690 --> 18:49.650
So whatever happens,
you can't let him take me alive.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.530
Uh...

18:52.360 --> 18:54.980
Clary,
you're kind of freaking me out.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.320
Trust me,
I've thought about it and...

18:59.410 --> 19:01.460
[scoffs] Maia was right.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.210
What are...
What are you talking about?

19:05.580 --> 19:09.750
I would rather die than let
Valentine destroy the Downworld.

19:11.170 --> 19:13.750
I need you to promise me.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.260
If Valentine ever gets to me...

19:18.970 --> 19:20.050
No.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.150
Absolutely not.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.430
I promise.

19:29.820 --> 19:33.110
If it ever comes to that,
I won't let him take you alive.

20:01.430 --> 20:02.520
Meliorn.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.310
What happened to your face?

20:04.390 --> 20:08.140
My punishment for helping Clary
Fairchild into one of the Queen's realms.

20:08.230 --> 20:09.900
Well, it's good to see you.

20:09.980 --> 20:13.600
I'd say the same, but, sadly,
I'm incapable of lying.

20:15.110 --> 20:17.150
Shall we get this over with?

20:18.110 --> 20:21.440
- Careful. Seelie armor.
- Means war. I noticed.

20:23.370 --> 20:26.080
So I assume you all know
why I called you here.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.450
- I've heard rumors.
- Well, unfortunately, the rumors are true.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.800
Valentine wants to use the Soul-Sword
to decimate the entire Downworld,

20:34.880 --> 20:36.670
and he needs Clary
to activate it.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.510
And you have a plan?

20:38.590 --> 20:41.090
Well, we can't defeat
Valentine on our own.

20:41.180 --> 20:43.730
But together...
maybe we have a shot.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.930
Whatever it is,
we can't have him get to Clary.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.190
I agree.

20:49.270 --> 20:52.360
But on behalf of the Seelie Queen,
I'd like to propose an alternative.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.820
Execute Clary
Fairchild on sight.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.530
- Care to rethink that?
- You'd be rotting in the City of Bones

21:04.620 --> 21:07.210
had she not insisted
we save your life.

21:07.290 --> 21:09.210
Then consider this my way
of returning the favor.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.710
By killing her,
I'll be saving you from yourselves.

21:13.630 --> 21:15.050
This council is biased.

21:16.090 --> 21:20.010
You've all allowed yourselves to become
too involved with the Shadowhunters.

21:20.090 --> 21:21.380
Jocelyn Fairchild.

21:23.050 --> 21:24.670
Alec Lightwood.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.730
- And you.
- [inhales deeply]

21:30.140 --> 21:32.100
You've been seeing
Isabelle, haven't you?

21:34.940 --> 21:38.100
- What are you talking about?
- I'd recognize that perfume anywhere.

21:38.190 --> 21:40.320
Then you're no different
from the rest of us.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.940
I'll admit,
I know her charms better than anyone.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.820
But unlike you,
my feelings never affect my judgment.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.910
My judgment's fine.

21:54.630 --> 21:56.930
Clary has to die to
protect our people...

21:58.710 --> 21:59.750
so be it.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.440
Stay here. We'll be right back.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.850
[siren wailing]

22:19.940 --> 22:22.610
We're close. Very close.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.070
This still feels way too easy.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.540
And yet we've
encountered no traps.

22:29.410 --> 22:32.780
Although if we did...
All that stuff you said about Clary...

22:32.870 --> 22:34.160
You were just talking, right?

22:34.250 --> 22:37.380
You wouldn't actually kill
your own sister, would you?

22:37.460 --> 22:39.370
- No.
- Okay.

22:40.340 --> 22:42.396
But that's why I need to do
this next part on my own.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.670
What do you mean?

22:44.840 --> 22:46.880
Clary's too weak to move, Simon.

22:46.970 --> 22:49.440
She'd only be putting herself
in danger of getting captured.

22:49.510 --> 22:52.850
Hey, I'll use the scarf to track Madzie.
I'll bring her back here.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.220
But I need someone protecting
Clary while I'm gone.

22:55.310 --> 22:57.456
That's easy for you to say.
You're the guy with the sword.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.940
[stammering] What am I gonna do?
Protect her with my teeth?

23:00.030 --> 23:01.820
We need your help here.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.200
- Okay. All right, I'll stay.
- [cell phone ringing]

23:08.990 --> 23:10.030
Just a sec, it's Luke.

23:10.870 --> 23:11.926
[Luke] <i>Simon, where are you?</i>

23:11.950 --> 23:14.240
Uh, we're still looking for Madzie.
What's up?

23:14.330 --> 23:17.250
[sighs] You need to be careful.
The Downworld's falling apart.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.460
I'm guessing the meeting
didn't go so well, then?

23:19.540 --> 23:22.000
The vampires and the
Seelies want Clary dead.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.170
They'll be hunting for you.

23:25.260 --> 23:26.736
You know,
good thing you called when you did,

23:26.760 --> 23:28.140
because Jace was just...

23:30.100 --> 23:31.890
Oh, no. I'll call you back.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.360
Okay.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.480
You can do this.

23:45.570 --> 23:47.280
[Maia] Is anybody out there?

23:48.700 --> 23:50.290
[yelling] Hello! [Grunts]

23:51.370 --> 23:53.870
[crying] Anybody? Anybody?

23:56.540 --> 23:58.000
[sobbing]

24:03.170 --> 24:04.170
No!

24:12.640 --> 24:14.810
[bones cracking]

24:21.690 --> 24:23.320
[growling]

24:43.460 --> 24:45.080
You sure we're safe up here?

24:46.460 --> 24:49.340
If I'm gonna die,
it's not gonna be in this van.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.430
[sighs heavily]

24:52.510 --> 24:53.840
Not on a night like tonight.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.930
- Maybe we should go looking for Jace.
- No.

25:02.730 --> 25:06.770
If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie,
we need to be here when he comes back.

25:06.860 --> 25:08.660
- Sure.
- Yeah.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.040
But at what point do we say
he's been gone too long?

25:12.110 --> 25:14.490
We don't. Okay?

25:19.580 --> 25:20.580
Hey...

25:22.250 --> 25:24.080
[breathing shakily]

25:24.170 --> 25:27.760
- If I don't make it...
- Stop. You will.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.850
You have to.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.060
Think about it. I mean...

25:33.140 --> 25:38.900
a dashing, handsome Jewish boy...
finally admits to his best friend

25:38.970 --> 25:42.310
- how he feels after a lifetime...
- [chuckles]

25:42.400 --> 25:44.280
And she dies a week later?

25:44.360 --> 25:47.860
That's too sappy.
Like a real-life <i>Fault in Our Stars.</i>

25:47.940 --> 25:49.940
[chuckles]

25:50.030 --> 25:52.240
That's not the plot
of that book at all.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.740
- Really?
- No.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.450
Oh, I never read it. Or saw it.

25:57.540 --> 25:59.830
I just kind of thought
that's what it was about.

25:59.910 --> 26:01.240
[chuckles]

26:01.830 --> 26:02.740
Hey.

26:02.830 --> 26:04.040
Hmm.

26:05.540 --> 26:08.330
[cries] I just need
you to know that...

26:11.260 --> 26:14.390
I'm so glad you and I...

26:15.260 --> 26:16.260
[softly] I know.

26:16.850 --> 26:17.980
[gasps]

26:29.360 --> 26:30.640
You said you know where Izzy is?

26:31.940 --> 26:33.440
Well, not exactly.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.880
You know,
I expect this from Aldertree...

26:37.700 --> 26:39.490
but not from you.

26:39.580 --> 26:43.340
What's going on? And why do I seem to
be the last person to know about it?

26:48.250 --> 26:50.880
A couple days ago,
I saw Isabelle trying to buy <i>yin fen</i>

26:50.960 --> 26:54.750
from a certain reprobate
warlock at the Hunter's Moon.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.590
You sure it was her?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.730
[sighs]

26:58.550 --> 27:02.300
I asked her what she was doing,
but she told me that she was undercover.

27:02.390 --> 27:05.470
- Why didn't you say anything?
- She's an excellent liar.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.260
It wasn't until this evening
that I put it all together.

27:08.770 --> 27:11.600
Something Meliorn said
at the Downworld meeting.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.230
I think she's getting her
fix straight from the source.

27:19.410 --> 27:20.750
Where is she?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.170
Careful, Madzie.
Don't burn yourself, hmm?

27:41.430 --> 27:42.430
[chuckles]

27:44.430 --> 27:45.850
How fatherly.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.640
I didn't know you had it in you.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.170
Ah, Jonathan.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.710
I figured you'd come for
young Madzie sooner or later.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.670
Although, it's a shame you
didn't bring your sister along.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.180
Let the girl go.

28:20.050 --> 28:23.630
I'm afraid young Madzie is
quite happy where she is.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.720
Oh, I think Iris would disagree.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.970
She made Clary
take a blood oath.

28:29.060 --> 28:31.930
If I don't get Madzie to
her in the next few hours...

28:32.020 --> 28:33.060
Clary dies.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.900
I suppose you're here
to save her life?

28:39.990 --> 28:41.450
I'm here to give
you an ultimatum.

28:42.870 --> 28:46.920
I'll let Clary die if I have to...
but you need her alive.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.290
You're bluffing.

28:50.710 --> 28:52.760
You couldn't kill your
falcon when you were a boy,

28:52.840 --> 28:54.380
and you can't kill
your sister now.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.330
I have demon blood.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.300
If you destroy the
Downworld, I go with it.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.060
I'm just trying to save myself.

29:03.140 --> 29:06.600
It's your choice...
but I'm not gonna ask you again.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.010
Either Madzie comes with me...

29:13.770 --> 29:15.400
or your angel dies.

29:25.910 --> 29:27.110
[slurping]

29:28.410 --> 29:31.490
- [door opens]
- Hey! What are you doing here?

29:31.580 --> 29:32.940
- You can't go in...
- [blow lands]

29:33.250 --> 29:34.330
[grunts]

29:34.420 --> 29:35.630
[gasps]

29:41.090 --> 29:42.250
[both grunt]

29:43.550 --> 29:45.550
- Alec?
- You stay the hell away from her.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.480
You don't understand. It was Aldertree
who got her addicted to <i>yin fen.</i>

29:49.930 --> 29:50.930
What?

29:51.020 --> 29:52.940
It's the truth.
I was only trying to help.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.310
By drinking her blood?

29:54.400 --> 29:56.320
[both grunting]

29:56.400 --> 29:57.586
It may have started
with the blood,

29:57.610 --> 29:59.126
but it's more complicated than
that, all right?

29:59.150 --> 30:00.610
I care about her.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.860
- What did you say?
- I... [panting]

30:06.030 --> 30:07.990
I have feelings for her.

30:10.410 --> 30:12.080
[exhales heavily]
Raphael, let him go.

30:13.330 --> 30:14.330
[grunting]

30:16.290 --> 30:17.290
Stop it!

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Stop!

30:20.170 --> 30:22.090
Alec, stop! This is my fault!

30:32.810 --> 30:33.930
Alec, stop!

30:37.310 --> 30:38.690
This is my family.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.296
If you had told me about the <i>yin fen,</i>
none of this would have happened.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.410
- I didn't know.
- [Alec] You knew enough.

30:44.150 --> 30:45.530
We're leaving.

30:54.670 --> 30:56.670
I wasn't lying
about what I said.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.040
[panting]

30:58.130 --> 30:59.680
There's something about her...

31:01.090 --> 31:02.720
I haven't felt this
way in a long time.

31:04.010 --> 31:05.970
You're so hooked on her blood,

31:06.050 --> 31:08.470
you can't separate your
feelings from your addiction.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.150
Isabelle and I are no
different from you and Alec.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.780
And I thought you of all
people would understand.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.650
If you truly believe that...

31:19.730 --> 31:22.150
see if you still feel the same
when you're not getting high.

31:27.700 --> 31:29.960
Let go, Alec! I'm staying!

31:30.620 --> 31:33.830
- Alec, let go!
- Izzy, come on!

31:33.910 --> 31:36.660
I know you think you're trying to
make things right, but you're not.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.880
Raphael's been there for
me when I needed him.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.510
Needed him?

31:41.420 --> 31:43.960
- Look at yourself.
- He saved my life.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.640
You didn't even notice
when something was wrong.

31:49.430 --> 31:53.020
- Saved your life? What are you...
- I'm not your baby sister anymore, Alec.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.980
Just go! I don't need your help.

31:58.730 --> 32:01.200
- Izzy, please.
- I said go.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.490
Fine.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.710
Clary, Clary...

32:23.800 --> 32:25.720
- [Clary breathing heavily]
- [breathing shakily]

32:29.970 --> 32:32.640
Clary. Clary, stay awake.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.720
Stay awake.

32:34.810 --> 32:38.190
Stay awake just a little longer...
Don't go.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.860
Hey, hey, don't cry.

32:42.940 --> 32:47.480
I'm not. It's, um, allergies.
[sniffles] You know me. Ragweed.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.200
- [Jace] Clary!
- Jace!

32:59.460 --> 33:00.550
[Clary] Madzie.

33:01.130 --> 33:02.630
Madzie, you're okay.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.690
I told you, didn't I?

33:26.780 --> 33:29.450
- I couldn't have saved her without you.
- Obviously.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.030
Thank you for...

33:33.950 --> 33:36.290
you know, everything.

33:42.330 --> 33:43.410
Madzie, what are you doing?

33:44.710 --> 33:46.080
[Jace] No! [Simon] Clary!

33:52.760 --> 33:54.460
[carnival music playing]

34:01.560 --> 34:03.020
[groaning]

34:20.290 --> 34:24.050
Well done, Madzie.
Your nana is gonna be so proud of you.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.679
But you still have a lot more to
do before you can see her, okay?

34:27.210 --> 34:28.370
So run along.

34:34.179 --> 34:35.520
Hello again, Clarissa.

34:38.969 --> 34:40.956
You must still hate me for
what happened to your mother.

34:40.980 --> 34:42.400
I don't blame you.

34:43.020 --> 34:46.489
Jocelyn's death will always
be my greatest regret.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.389
If you have any shred of humanity
left, you would stop this.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.270
My humanity is what
keeps me going.

34:52.530 --> 34:55.489
If the angels designed the Sword
to rid the world of demons,

34:55.570 --> 34:58.780
I'm just ensuring it
fulfills its true purpose.

35:01.120 --> 35:04.160
[panting] Okay, this isn't good.
Clary could be anywhere.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.960
Not anywhere. Valentine still
needs a bolt of lightning.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.080
Great. So what's the plan?

35:08.170 --> 35:11.550
You want me to check the five-day forecast
for every city in the entire world?

35:11.630 --> 35:13.510
You were right.
Finding Madzie was way too easy.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.360
As much as I love to hear you say
that, now is really not the time.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.236
Okay, Luke just texted me.
Maybe he can do something.

35:19.260 --> 35:21.090
- [man screaming]
- What the hell?

35:24.770 --> 35:25.780
[snarling]

35:25.850 --> 35:27.180
[Jace] Don't move!

35:39.370 --> 35:41.920
- He's dead.
- Dude, that's not normal.

35:41.990 --> 35:43.660
Even the worst of
Camille's people

35:43.750 --> 35:45.306
wouldn't risk attacking
a mundane on the street.

35:45.330 --> 35:47.910
- Especially not with a Seelie.
- That was a Seelie?

35:49.380 --> 35:50.816
Do you think that's what
Luke was talking about?

35:50.840 --> 35:51.930
A Downworld revolt?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.250
No. No, I recognize that vamp.
He's in Valentine's zoo.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.970
Why would Valentine have
Downworlders attack mundanes?

35:59.050 --> 36:00.050
That makes no sense.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.860
It must have something
to do with the Sword.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.260
- [man screaming]
- [cell phone ringing]

36:07.850 --> 36:09.140
Jace? Are you okay?

36:09.230 --> 36:12.320
- No. Something weird's going on, Alec.
- [Alec] Yeah, tell me about it.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.820
We have reports of violent
Downworlders all over Manhattan.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.070
I think it's Valentine.

36:16.150 --> 36:18.046
I can explain later,
but right now, I need your help.

36:18.070 --> 36:20.530
- Is Clary...
- It's complicated.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.080
Yeah,
what's that supposed to mean?

36:23.620 --> 36:26.140
It means we fulfilled the blood
oath, but now Valentine has her.

36:26.210 --> 36:28.090
I think he's trying to
activate the Soul-Sword.

36:28.170 --> 36:30.880
I need everyone you have to
be looking for her right now.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.290
Yeah, that's not that easy.

36:32.380 --> 36:35.180
Aldertree dispatched every Shadowhunter
we have to stop the attacks.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.140
Well, undispatch them, Alec.

36:37.220 --> 36:39.350
Hey, I think I know
how to find Clary.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.470
[clattering]

36:53.110 --> 36:54.910
[growling]

36:55.530 --> 36:56.820
[woman] What do you want?

36:56.900 --> 36:58.360
What do you want?

36:58.450 --> 37:00.200
[woman screaming]

37:03.740 --> 37:05.410
- [screaming]
- Hey!

37:05.490 --> 37:06.780
- [vampire growls]
- [yells]

37:10.540 --> 37:12.120
[screaming]

37:16.420 --> 37:17.460
[growling]

37:17.550 --> 37:18.930
Remember me?

37:20.510 --> 37:21.640
[grunting]

37:22.340 --> 37:24.590
[hisses] Where do you come from?

37:25.390 --> 37:26.850
Where's Valentine?

37:28.310 --> 37:30.020
Where's Valentine? Tell me!

37:30.100 --> 37:31.350
[growling]

37:33.020 --> 37:34.140
Tell me!

37:35.400 --> 37:36.660
[woman whimpers]

37:39.280 --> 37:41.160
[Simon grunting]

37:43.490 --> 37:44.900
- [gunshots]
- [body thuds]

37:48.120 --> 37:49.120
[sighs]

37:49.580 --> 37:51.220
Are you kidding me?
I thought he was dead.

37:52.540 --> 37:55.040
- He definitely is now.
- [growling]

37:56.500 --> 37:58.130
Valentine must be
experimenting again.

37:58.800 --> 38:02.060
- I bet there's more where that came from.
- Which means...

38:03.220 --> 38:04.680
you're gonna tell
us where he is,

38:04.760 --> 38:06.520
or you're gonna end up
just like your friend.

38:12.940 --> 38:14.280
[wolf growling]

38:18.440 --> 38:20.730
[bones cracking]

38:33.420 --> 38:34.670
[door opens]

38:37.340 --> 38:39.010
[footsteps approaching]

39:03.570 --> 39:05.006
Okay, I know this is
an abandoned building,

39:05.030 --> 39:07.990
but it's starting to
seem extra-abandoned.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.790
- Are we too late?
- No. Scent's still fresh.

39:11.870 --> 39:13.990
Someone's here.
We gotta move fast.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.830
Fan out.
Cover as much ground as you can.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.170
[Alec] The initial attacks
were in South Brooklyn,

39:21.260 --> 39:23.446
so we're gonna focus our search
there and then move outward.

39:23.470 --> 39:27.520
Remember, whatever happens,
our priority is to locate Clary.

39:28.510 --> 39:29.590
Disregard that order.

39:30.810 --> 39:32.560
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

39:32.640 --> 39:35.060
Stopping Valentine from
destroying the Downworld.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.206
And yet from the look of things,

39:36.230 --> 39:37.786
it's the Downworld that's
trying to destroy us.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.180
Look,
I don't have time to argue.

39:39.270 --> 39:41.770
- Either help me, or get out of the way.
- Or you'll do what?

39:41.860 --> 39:44.780
Remember how I said that
you were hiding something?

39:44.860 --> 39:47.900
Supplying <i>yin fen</i>
to a subordinate...

39:47.990 --> 39:50.240
An ex-field medic
should know better.

39:50.330 --> 39:54.460
And you expect anyone to actually
believe this ridiculous accusation?

39:54.540 --> 39:56.920
Who knows? Idris loves gossip.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.010
And you're one Clave investigation away
from treating frostbite on Wrangel Island.

40:01.710 --> 40:04.920
From now on,
I'm calling the shots.

40:05.510 --> 40:08.520
Don't ever threaten
my family again.

40:09.800 --> 40:14.050
Now if you don't mind, I need these
Shadowhunters to go find Clary.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.560
Do as he says.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.120
[sighs heavily]

40:33.950 --> 40:35.450
[footsteps approaching]

40:35.540 --> 40:37.420
- Jace!
- Clary!

40:38.170 --> 40:39.300
Where's Valentine?

40:39.870 --> 40:41.856
I don't know. All the Circle
members just left in a hurry.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.300
Okay. Don't move.

40:45.050 --> 40:47.760
- Okay, we have to get out of here before...
- Going someplace?

40:53.430 --> 40:54.840
I didn't think so.

40:54.930 --> 40:57.390
She's strong for her
age, isn't she?

40:59.190 --> 41:02.360
Madzie. Hey, please...

41:02.440 --> 41:03.820
Please let Jace go.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.860
Now why would she do that, hmm?

41:05.940 --> 41:07.810
Because you wanna hurt people.

41:08.990 --> 41:10.410
People like Iris.

41:12.490 --> 41:13.570
[Valentine] Don't forget...

41:14.700 --> 41:18.410
this is the mean person that got your
nana in trouble in the first place.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.040
Now, if you want to see Iris,

41:20.120 --> 41:23.750
you have to be a good little girl
and do exactly what I say, okay?

41:24.920 --> 41:26.140
[grunting]

41:27.710 --> 41:28.750
Clary, run!

41:28.840 --> 41:30.170
[grunting]

41:32.680 --> 41:34.270
[Valentine] Brave and stupid.

41:35.220 --> 41:38.890
Sweetheart, save your magic for
what's to come. It's time to go.

41:42.520 --> 41:45.350
- I'll see you soon, Clarissa.
- Simon!

41:46.650 --> 41:47.980
Simon, no!
