if they wanted privacy, I would
never follow them or, like,

19:11.350 --> 19:12.880
never follow them or, like,
expose them.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.110
Expose them.
We're all different, and

19:14.120 --> 19:15.780
we're all different, and
this is the kind of stuff that

19:15.780 --> 19:17.850
this is the kind of stuff that
makes me feel that they put the

19:17.850 --> 19:20.690

is important to maintain as it

20:00.630 --> 20:02.130

When I found out I was pregnant,
