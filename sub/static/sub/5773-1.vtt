St. Francis High School

01:20.601 --> 01:22.899
Ty Crane,
who they recruited just last year,

01:23.104 --> 01:25.265
is widely held as
the next LeBron James.

01:25.506 --> 01:27.736
We simply know him
as ''The Crane.''

01:29.444 --> 01:30.411
Come on.

01:45.959 --> 01:49.020
Come on, y'all!
Timo, let's go man, come on.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.458
Yeah, whatever.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.901
Where you at? Where you at?

02:03.109 --> 02:04.576
Pick him up! Pick him up!

02:11.017 --> 02:12.211
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

02:12.419 --> 02:13.647
Right here, right here.

02:16.856 --> 02:18.413
- Blue ball!
- Good D, baby!

02:18.624 --> 02:20.285
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing, y'all?

02:20.492 --> 02:23.484
- You took three steps this way.
- Yo, l put my fist up, man.

02:23.695 --> 02:26.027
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing
the ball, man. Damn.

02:26.231 --> 02:28.530
- Get your man!
- l knew it. l knew it.

02:32.571 --> 02:33.765
Yeah!

02:34.006 --> 02:35.837
St. Francis is up by 22.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.579
Stay out of my way, bitch.
l own you.

02:47.786 --> 02:49.720
- Oh, hell no!
- Bitch!

02:49.922 --> 02:51.822
Let's go! Let's go!

02:52.290 --> 02:54.417
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

02:57.462 --> 02:59.794
- Let me go!
- Hey! Hey!

03:01.499 --> 03:03.126
l'm good. Get off me!

03:03.633 --> 03:04.998
Get off me, get off me!

03:05.802 --> 03:07.464
That's it! Game's over!

03:08.539 --> 03:09.938
Game's over!

03:10.141 --> 03:11.506
Crane. Great game, great game.

03:11.709 --> 03:15.769
Tell everyone out there what it
feels like to be the next LeBron James.

03:15.979 --> 03:19.540
LeBron James?
l'm the only Ty Crane.

03:21.418 --> 03:25.047
All right, you heard it here first,
''the only Ty Crane.''

03:25.489 --> 03:27.753
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.391
We watching the damn game,
that's why.

03:29.593 --> 03:31.083
- You got a good view, huh?
- Yeah.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.262
Ty Crane outscored
our whole team by himself.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.829
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had nothing but 32 points.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.932
l got 1 2 of them.
What did you get, Kenyon?

03:38.168 --> 03:39.930
Just shut up, dog.
The Crane swooped down on you

03:40.169 --> 03:42.262
and delivered a basket of beat-down.
He clowned you, dog.

03:42.505 --> 03:45.235
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.
- He had you on lock the whole game.

03:45.441 --> 03:47.876
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before l close it for good.

03:48.078 --> 03:49.602
You didn't do shit either
the whole game.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.780
What, homey?
l will slap the taste out your mouth!

03:51.981 --> 03:54.006
- Can we all just get along?
- Shut your little ass up!

03:54.216 --> 03:56.275
- You didn't even play!
- That's what l'm talking about.

03:56.485 --> 03:59.215
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!
- You got two points in 1 6 minutes,

03:59.421 --> 04:01.514
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.
- Exactly!

04:01.724 --> 04:04.157
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

04:04.359 --> 04:05.987
You didn't do shit.
You might as well--

04:06.195 --> 04:09.528
- Who was you passing the ball to?
- You were playing and didn't do shit!

04:15.603 --> 04:19.539
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond
High School all-American, 1 9 72.

04:20.141 --> 04:21.506
Good to see you, sir.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.870
l was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

04:24.078 --> 04:27.377
l have to tell you, sir,
l haven't made up my mind yet.

04:28.816 --> 04:31.580
As l've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

04:31.786 --> 04:34.050
Last few years
have been really tough.

04:34.255 --> 04:36.223
Well, losing's hard, sir.

04:37.457 --> 04:40.358
This isn't about
losing games, Kenny.

04:41.628 --> 04:45.861
l can't get them to show up
for school, for practice.

04:46.367 --> 04:49.563
l can't get parents involved, and l'm
done chasing kids in the streets

04:49.770 --> 04:51.237
and pulling them into the gym.

04:51.471 --> 04:53.063
Yeah, it's a tough job.

04:53.273 --> 04:55.434
Richmond is a tough little city.

04:55.842 --> 04:59.073
When l saw you here tonight,
l thought, ''l got him. He's in.''

04:59.279 --> 05:02.111
Well, actually,
l was here for another reason.

05:02.315 --> 05:04.944
My son plays for St. Francis.

05:05.152 --> 05:06.642
He does?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.850
- Which kid was he?
- Well, you didn't see him.

05:10.057 --> 05:13.321
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.
- That's great. Great school.

05:14.827 --> 05:16.021
What, you wanna go?

05:18.698 --> 05:20.598
- Hey!
- Lyle, bring it!

05:20.800 --> 05:24.031
Let him go. You think everybody's
scared of you? l ain't scared of you!

05:24.237 --> 05:28.571
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be
trying to act all hard all the time, man?

05:28.908 --> 05:31.206
God, l'm sick of you, man!

05:33.579 --> 05:35.944
You know, that school was rough
when l went there.

05:36.147 --> 05:38.638
lt's way beyond that now.

05:38.850 --> 05:41.546
Well, then, just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

05:41.753 --> 05:45.884
l can't quite do that. Coach officially
offered me the job tonight.

05:46.092 --> 05:47.285
The clock's ticking.

05:47.492 --> 05:50.359
And when you say ''offering job,''
there's usually money involved.

05:50.562 --> 05:53.963
Yeah, there might be
a thousand bucks in it for me.

05:54.165 --> 05:55.564
For five months of work?

05:55.767 --> 05:58.701
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

05:58.902 --> 06:01.132
And the team, it's so bad.

06:01.338 --> 06:04.137
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

06:04.342 --> 06:06.276
And besides, you know,
you don't have the time.

06:06.478 --> 06:07.968
You're trying to open up
a second store.

06:08.179 --> 06:10.578
Exactly, l don't have the--
Hell, l don't have any time.

06:10.781 --> 06:12.806
And you promised to take
your girlfriend to Mexico.

06:13.017 --> 06:14.484
And l'm definitely
keeping that promise.

06:14.685 --> 06:16.915
There's no way
l'm not going to Mexico

06:17.121 --> 06:20.181
and hanging out on the beach
with you in your bikini.

06:20.391 --> 06:21.584
l can't take that job.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.527
So when do you start?

06:29.066 --> 06:31.000
- You should've spoken to me first.
- Why?

06:31.201 --> 06:34.567
- lt was a personal choice for me.
- So, what happens to me?

06:34.771 --> 06:36.295
You still gonna come to my games?

06:36.506 --> 06:39.339
l'll probably miss most of
your games, Damien. l'm sorry.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.066
Then l'll go to Richmond
and play for you.

06:41.277 --> 06:42.471
No.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.307
Well, why not?

06:44.814 --> 06:49.183
- Dad, you've always been my coach.
- This is a great school, Damien.

06:49.619 --> 06:51.211
lt puts you in a great position
for college.

06:51.421 --> 06:52.854
Dad, l'm a freshman!

06:53.056 --> 06:54.648
Just because l'm coaching
at Richmond,

06:54.857 --> 06:57.324
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

07:23.685 --> 07:27.348
Yo, my man, l need a vial, man.
You got that good dope? How much?

07:41.870 --> 07:43.302
You forgot to bring your lD,
didn't you?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.529
- l forgot it.
- Every day.

07:45.806 --> 07:48.570
Good morning. Ken Carter.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.579
- Thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

07:54.681 --> 07:56.342
Hey, yo, what's up?

08:01.087 --> 08:03.886
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

08:04.091 --> 08:08.322
lf the offer still stands,
l'd like to coach the team.

08:10.029 --> 08:13.328
Well, l hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

08:14.134 --> 08:16.068
The job comes with a $1 ,500 stipend

08:16.269 --> 08:19.362
and a major time commitment
for the next four months.

08:20.339 --> 08:22.570
- l accept.
- Great.

08:22.942 --> 08:25.342
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, l hate to be abrupt,

08:25.545 --> 08:27.740
but l do have a budget meeting
l need to run to.

08:27.947 --> 08:30.073
Mr. Carter, is there anything
you need from us?

08:30.282 --> 08:34.651
Well, l just need about
25 copies of this document.

08:36.221 --> 08:38.519
- l'm all set.
- Ray, would you see to it

08:38.757 --> 08:40.885
that Mr. Carter--?
Coach Carter gets these copies?

08:41.127 --> 08:43.594
- Will do.
- Gentlemen.

08:46.265 --> 08:49.632
l'm not saying this is
not gonna be a challenge,

08:49.835 --> 08:51.302
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

08:51.503 --> 08:54.494
Just keep in mind,
these are good boys.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.969
Guys! Guys!

08:57.175 --> 08:58.767
Guys!

08:58.976 --> 09:02.208
Now, as you know, l've been-- Hey!

09:02.414 --> 09:03.972
You know l've been looking
for a new coach

09:04.183 --> 09:06.309
to take over for me this season.

09:06.951 --> 09:10.011
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

09:10.221 --> 09:12.746
He was a two-sport all-American.

09:12.990 --> 09:16.288
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

09:16.493 --> 09:19.929
Basketball scholarship to
George Mason University.

09:20.131 --> 09:22.258
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

09:22.467 --> 09:25.459
Now, let's give him
the respect he's due.

09:25.670 --> 09:28.103
- They're all yours, coach.
- Thank you, sir.

09:31.575 --> 09:33.202
Good afternoon, young men.

09:33.410 --> 09:38.279
As Coach White said, l'm your
new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

09:39.316 --> 09:41.250
l guess l need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

09:41.451 --> 09:43.885
l'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.385
We hear you, dog.
But we can't see you.

09:47.624 --> 09:49.091
The glare from your
big, black-ass head

09:49.326 --> 09:51.293
is hella shiny, man.
Damn, do you buff it?

09:51.494 --> 09:54.861
Oh, you got jokes to go along
with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

09:56.899 --> 09:59.562
First of all, if you need to know
my credentials,

09:59.769 --> 10:03.135
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

10:03.606 --> 10:09.977
Secondly, if basketball practice
starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

10:11.614 --> 10:14.741
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

10:14.949 --> 10:17.884
Jason Lyle, but l ain't no sir.

10:18.119 --> 10:19.485
You're not a sir.

10:20.222 --> 10:21.712
Well, are you a madam?

10:23.092 --> 10:27.152
- Little bitch. Bitch.
- As of now, you are a sir.

10:27.362 --> 10:29.057
So are the rest of you.

10:29.264 --> 10:31.824
''Sir'' is a term of respect.

10:32.033 --> 10:35.594
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

10:36.170 --> 10:40.231
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

10:41.075 --> 10:43.566
Like four wins, 22 losses.

10:43.912 --> 10:46.039
- Sir.
- Sir.

10:48.516 --> 10:50.813
l'm going to give you contracts.

10:52.853 --> 10:56.687
lf you sign and honor
your side of them,

10:56.890 --> 10:59.052
we are going to be successful.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.625
Damn, do l get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

11:01.828 --> 11:05.594
Yes, sir.
You get to become a winner.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.765
Because if there's one thing l know,
it is this:

11:10.270 --> 11:12.703
The losing stops now.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.234
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners,

11:17.443 --> 11:21.278
and most importantly,
you will be winners.

11:21.481 --> 11:25.007
lf you listen and learn,
you'll win basketball games.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.510
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

11:29.021 --> 11:31.251
...is the key to winning out there.

11:31.691 --> 11:36.184
This contract states that you will
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

11:36.394 --> 11:38.226
You will attend all your classes

11:38.431 --> 11:41.195
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.062
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.
- Excuse me.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.932
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering,

11:47.139 --> 11:50.073
are you some country church nigga,
with your tie on and all that?

11:50.275 --> 11:51.867
- Right.
- That's what you wanna say, right?

11:52.077 --> 11:53.305
And what is your name, sir?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.543
l'm Timo Cruz, sir.

11:55.847 --> 11:58.942
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

11:59.784 --> 12:04.619
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.256
We don't use the word ''nigga.''

12:06.458 --> 12:08.358
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

12:08.560 --> 12:10.789
Because God ain't gonna do you
no good in this neighborhood.

12:10.995 --> 12:13.088
- l live in this neighborhood, sir.
- Sir.

12:13.297 --> 12:16.289
Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

12:17.902 --> 12:19.494
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

12:20.205 --> 12:23.105
- ...leave the gym right now.
- For what?

12:23.307 --> 12:27.141
l'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym

12:27.344 --> 12:30.871
- before l help you leave.
- Before you what?

12:32.449 --> 12:33.711
Do you even know who l am?

12:34.317 --> 12:37.446
From what l can see, a very confused
and scared young man.

12:37.688 --> 12:41.089
Scared of who? Scared of you?
l'm supposed to be scared of you?

12:41.458 --> 12:44.359
Nigga, l ain't scared of nobody.
l will lay your ass out.

12:44.561 --> 12:45.822
l don't think so.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.324
All right.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.172
What you doing? Get off me!

13:04.213 --> 13:06.204
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

13:06.449 --> 13:08.212
l'm not a teacher.

13:08.818 --> 13:10.808
l'm your new basketball coach.

13:19.762 --> 13:21.729
This ain't over!

13:35.777 --> 13:39.178
ls there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

13:40.515 --> 13:42.813
Come on, man, where you going?

13:45.252 --> 13:47.243
l don't do high school contracts.

13:47.488 --> 13:48.955
Tell us when you need
the real ballers.

13:49.156 --> 13:51.249
l will do that, sir.

13:51.459 --> 13:53.260
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

13:53.360 --> 13:53.954
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

13:54.161 --> 13:57.324
Then l guess we'll have new
leading scorers this season, huh?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.295
Now, l cannot teach you the game
of basketball

14:01.502 --> 14:05.495
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

14:05.706 --> 14:08.868
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

14:11.778 --> 14:13.211
To the baseline!

14:20.620 --> 14:23.418
l presume you all know
what suicides are.

14:23.623 --> 14:24.851
So...

14:32.831 --> 14:35.357
l saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

14:36.035 --> 14:38.595
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

14:38.938 --> 14:42.464
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

14:43.408 --> 14:46.400
lf you are late, you will run.

14:46.645 --> 14:50.479
lf you give me attitude,
you will do push-ups.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.817
So you can push-up or shut up.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.486
That's up to you.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.118
- Yo, how many we gonna do?
- Sir.

14:59.224 --> 15:01.749
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

15:01.960 --> 15:07.022
Let's see how many you can do
in one hour and seven minutes.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.599
Fellas, don't make me
commit homicide.

15:10.968 --> 15:14.336
l said, suicides!
Put your hand on the line!

15:14.540 --> 15:17.406
Put your hand on the line!

15:19.677 --> 15:23.613
Damn, l can't keep this shit up, man.
l can barely walk.

15:23.815 --> 15:27.251
- l know, my legs is hella sore, son.
- Need some Gatorade or something.

15:28.419 --> 15:31.444
- There go your girl right there, son.
- Yeah.

15:31.655 --> 15:34.216
Hey, what's with you and her homeys?
You gonna try to holler at them?

15:34.425 --> 15:36.620
Man, l'm hollering
at both of the friends.

15:36.828 --> 15:38.420
- Both of them?
- Yeah, because l need that.

15:38.629 --> 15:41.620
You know, l need variety in my life.
l can't just have one girl.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.197
You know what l'm saying?
l need both.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.628
Hey.

15:44.835 --> 15:46.097
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

15:46.303 --> 15:49.466
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard
about that two-for-one special, right?

15:50.340 --> 15:53.571
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.472
- Please. Whatever, Worm.
- Yeah, special ed.

15:57.714 --> 15:59.272
- Get your arm off me.
- l like this fox.

15:59.516 --> 16:01.882
You working that chinchilla.
But, look, baby, me and you...

16:02.085 --> 16:05.645
You need to tell him to stop playing it
so close. She don't even like him.

16:07.089 --> 16:10.786
- Why not? Worm's the man.
- Worm is Worm.

16:13.396 --> 16:17.092
Anyway, l got something
for the baby today.

16:26.342 --> 16:29.310
We don't even know if it's a baby yet.
l mean, it's kind of early.

16:29.544 --> 16:31.205
You ain't even been
to the doctor yet.

16:31.446 --> 16:35.508
Hello? l passed the pregnancy test,
Kenyon. Three times.

16:42.624 --> 16:45.752
- These are kind of cute, though.
- l know, l got good taste, right?

16:45.960 --> 16:47.427
Yeah, all right.

16:48.396 --> 16:49.624
Precious little shoes.

16:49.831 --> 16:52.891
Well, l got a little
somethin'-somethin' for you too.

16:56.304 --> 16:57.794
Thank you.

16:58.406 --> 17:00.670
This definitely is a little something.

17:02.976 --> 17:06.070
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

17:07.614 --> 17:08.842
Kenyon!

17:09.049 --> 17:11.313
- What? What's up?
- What are you doing? Give me!

17:11.518 --> 17:13.349
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

17:13.553 --> 17:15.111
You got that for 99 cents?
l've been there.

17:15.322 --> 17:18.257
You can get three brooms and a bucket
for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.393
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

17:22.729 --> 17:25.128
Well, would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

17:28.100 --> 17:30.125
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

17:30.336 --> 17:33.033
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

17:33.273 --> 17:35.867
Three push-ups and move.
One! Two! Three!

17:36.109 --> 17:37.905
Let's go. Explode!

17:38.110 --> 17:41.409
Let me hear you. Let me hear you!
Let me hear it.

17:41.614 --> 17:43.809
Explode! Worm, explode!

17:44.016 --> 17:45.381
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

17:45.584 --> 17:47.643
Give me five!
Just give me five! Push!

17:47.853 --> 17:50.878
Push! Go! Go!
Let me hear you!

17:51.089 --> 17:54.287
Come on, close out!
Explode! Let's go!

17:56.529 --> 17:58.588
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

18:01.066 --> 18:05.127
That's ten suicides for the
whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

18:05.370 --> 18:06.803
This ain't the track team, man.

18:07.005 --> 18:09.439
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

18:09.641 --> 18:11.108
But you're right.

18:11.543 --> 18:15.479
And because you're right,
that's 20 suicides for the entire team

18:15.680 --> 18:17.841
and you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle

18:18.049 --> 18:20.882
- with 250 push-ups of your own.
- What, are you serious?

18:21.086 --> 18:22.849
- Yeah.
- This is bullshit!

18:24.855 --> 18:26.686
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

18:26.890 --> 18:28.414
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.058
Because you gave
such a good answer

18:30.260 --> 18:31.785
and you gave the coach attitude,

18:31.997 --> 18:35.523
you win the bonus prize
of 500 push-ups!

18:36.000 --> 18:38.992
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of a thousand?

18:40.704 --> 18:42.399
No, sir.

18:43.974 --> 18:47.409
To the baseline!
On my whistle! Let's go!

18:47.610 --> 18:49.407
J.B., come on, baby.

18:49.946 --> 18:52.438
l can't even move, son.
Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

18:52.649 --> 18:55.584
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't l say nothing to him?

18:56.587 --> 18:58.076
l'm a white boy? Man, what the--?

18:58.888 --> 19:01.322
Right here. Right here.
Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

19:01.657 --> 19:03.682
Where you going, homey?
Where you going, huh?

19:03.893 --> 19:05.053
- l ain't got shit.
- What?

19:05.261 --> 19:07.729
Please don't shoot me, man.
Go on, take my bag, dog!

19:07.930 --> 19:09.897
Run your shit, homey!

19:16.239 --> 19:18.366
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

19:18.608 --> 19:21.076
Yo, l'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

19:21.277 --> 19:23.972
l'm just playing, B.
Look at you!

19:24.946 --> 19:28.347
Damn! l seen y'all
walking from up the block

19:28.550 --> 19:31.042
like somebody put a pipe
in your asses.

19:31.821 --> 19:33.287
You all right, dog?

19:34.489 --> 19:36.116
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

19:36.324 --> 19:38.849
but y'all damn sure
look sad without me.

19:39.061 --> 19:41.120
But you know what?
l'm gonna watch y'all play.

19:41.329 --> 19:42.762
See y'all get your asses kicked.

19:42.964 --> 19:47.263
Yo! l'd love to shoot the shit with
you bitches all night, but l gotta go.

19:47.635 --> 19:49.763
- All right.
- Yo, who that, man?

19:50.005 --> 19:51.734
That's my cousin, Renny.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.464
l'm gonna check y'all.
Come on, let's go.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.642
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

19:55.844 --> 19:57.208
- No, l'm straight, man.
- You sure?

19:57.411 --> 19:59.242
- Yeah, l'm good.
- All right, my nigga.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.642
- One love.
- All right, Lyle!

20:01.849 --> 20:05.808
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

20:09.723 --> 20:12.658
Hey, you was scared, huh?
l wasn't scared.

20:13.060 --> 20:15.551
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

20:15.763 --> 20:17.253
Now, you got in here
they need a 2.3.

20:17.465 --> 20:20.763
lf you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1 050 on the SAT

20:21.000 --> 20:23.491
to be eligible
for an athletic scholarship.

20:23.803 --> 20:27.034
lf you have a 2.3,
you only need 950.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.902
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

20:30.277 --> 20:33.109
lt shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.675
These boys are student athletes.

20:36.182 --> 20:37.877
''Student'' comes first.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.577
lt says they gotta wear
coat and ties on game days.

20:41.788 --> 20:44.312
They don't own ties!
You gonna supply the ties?

20:44.523 --> 20:46.582
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store

20:46.792 --> 20:48.818
less than two blocks from here.

20:49.028 --> 20:51.496
They got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

20:51.731 --> 20:53.562
Yo, man, what you
trying to say, huh?

20:54.167 --> 20:57.226
Oh, we too good to shop at the
Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

20:57.469 --> 20:59.869
- Yeah, l ain't that broke.
- This is crazy!

21:00.005 --> 21:02.906
A dress code and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

21:03.108 --> 21:07.874
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

21:08.179 --> 21:11.013
lf you want to play basketball
on this team,

21:11.216 --> 21:13.946
these are the simple rules
you have to follow

21:14.153 --> 21:16.883
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

21:17.322 --> 21:20.415
Now, if you decide
to follow these simple rules,

21:20.758 --> 21:24.455
l need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

21:25.396 --> 21:28.594
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.733
lf you come to practice.

21:31.102 --> 21:34.094
l wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support,

21:34.338 --> 21:37.239
and l hope l have your support
the rest of the season.

21:38.576 --> 21:40.237
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

21:40.444 --> 21:43.674
Look, l have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

21:45.382 --> 21:48.147
- How you gonna make them wear ties?
- l want the other coach back!

22:00.397 --> 22:04.389
lt's one of your contracts, sir.
l've amended that contract.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.870
You require your players
to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

22:08.104 --> 22:10.732
l've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

22:11.007 --> 22:14.170
You require ten hours of community
service, and l've committed to 50.

22:14.377 --> 22:18.574
Any unexcused absences, any other
disciplinary issues at school,

22:18.781 --> 22:21.944
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

22:23.752 --> 22:26.186
And how many days do l have
to consider this offer?

22:26.388 --> 22:27.753
None.

22:27.957 --> 22:29.549
The second page
is a letter you need to sign

22:29.758 --> 22:31.851
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

22:32.995 --> 22:34.485
- They know l'm leaving.
- What?

22:34.730 --> 22:37.221
- You withdrew from St. Francis?
- l called Richmond.

22:37.466 --> 22:40.195
- They expect me there in the morning.
- You called Richmond?

22:40.602 --> 22:42.399
You should have spoken to me
about this.

22:43.304 --> 22:45.738
lt was a personal choice for me.

22:49.478 --> 22:51.468
Well, l can fix all that in the morning.

22:52.380 --> 22:55.315
Sir, please listen.
All l wanna do is play for you.

22:55.984 --> 22:57.542
lf l'm one of the top students
at Richmond,

22:57.952 --> 23:01.251
l mean one of the top in the whole
school, and l have great SATs,

23:01.456 --> 23:03.787
l can go to any college
in the country.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.557
l'm asking you to trust me.

23:09.063 --> 23:10.963
You really wanna do this, huh?

23:16.536 --> 23:18.026
Okay.

23:18.739 --> 23:20.673
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions

23:20.874 --> 23:23.672
and living with the consequences.

23:28.348 --> 23:30.873
3.7.

23:31.485 --> 23:35.216
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

23:38.557 --> 23:39.854
Open it, please.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.284
Morning, sir.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.431
My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild

23:50.403 --> 23:53.429
lt's all right
Kenyon's mom tonight

23:53.639 --> 23:55.732
- Say what?
- You might think l'm wrong

23:56.342 --> 23:58.139
But she's got these thongs

23:59.078 --> 24:01.807
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
lt's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.647
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!
- Whatever.

24:03.848 --> 24:06.181
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here, son?

24:06.819 --> 24:09.947
- l transferred to Richmond.
- Oh, no, son, l think you're just lost.

24:10.156 --> 24:12.646
Well, l am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to...?

24:12.857 --> 24:16.156
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm,
tell your man Fresh Prince here

24:16.361 --> 24:19.330
- how to get to his mansion.
- Fresh bitch.

24:22.734 --> 24:26.431
l hope seeing you in this hallway mean
l get to see you on the court today.

24:28.206 --> 24:31.733
l can't wait. With your five browns.

24:34.079 --> 24:35.444
Everybody up.

24:37.247 --> 24:39.841
Today we're going to play defense.

24:41.385 --> 24:42.875
Sorry, sir.

24:43.654 --> 24:47.056
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

24:47.658 --> 24:50.024
He is my son, and he is late.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.695
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

24:52.896 --> 24:54.693
Sir, it's my first day of school,
l had to stay--

24:54.898 --> 24:56.798
Basketball practice starts at 3.

24:57.167 --> 25:00.602
As of 2:55, you are late.
Get changed in the locker room.

25:00.803 --> 25:04.706
Do your suicides on the far side
of the court so as not to disturb us.

25:04.908 --> 25:07.240
All right, gentlemen,
give me two lines!

25:08.312 --> 25:11.906
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna
take it to the next level.

25:12.648 --> 25:15.276
Everything l knew about basketball,

25:15.885 --> 25:17.375
l learned from women.

25:18.588 --> 25:21.580
l have a sister, her name's Diane.

25:21.891 --> 25:26.055
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

25:26.295 --> 25:28.763
Matter of fact, she still is.

25:28.965 --> 25:32.264
''Turn down that radio!
You eat the last piece of cake?

25:32.468 --> 25:34.458
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?''

25:35.404 --> 25:37.964
She was always in my face.

25:38.306 --> 25:40.331
So when l call ''Diane,''

25:40.542 --> 25:44.206
we're gonna play straight
man-to-man pressure defense.

25:49.084 --> 25:51.484
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.948
Look at your defensive posture.

25:53.188 --> 25:56.521
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

25:56.725 --> 25:59.716
This hand guards against the passing
lane, this hand protects the crossover.

25:59.894 --> 26:02.692
All right? Palms up!
Get your head in the game.

26:03.665 --> 26:05.599
Now we have Delilah.

26:06.334 --> 26:08.199
She was my childhood sweetheart.

26:08.403 --> 26:09.801
Sir, was she hot?

26:10.004 --> 26:14.600
Oh, yes, sir.
She was steaming hot.

26:16.510 --> 26:20.377
But she was the devil.
That girl was evil.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.682
l remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies

26:23.884 --> 26:27.285
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

26:27.688 --> 26:29.656
She smiled
and got her way out of it,

26:29.890 --> 26:32.653
while l damn near had to wear
a pillow on my butt

26:32.859 --> 26:34.486
for a month
before l could sit down.

26:35.495 --> 26:38.328
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.961
Take notes, freshman. This is as
close as you gonna get to playing.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.801
Come on, come on. Move, move!
Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

26:56.715 --> 26:58.979
Now, l know you're all
concerned that

26:59.218 --> 27:01.345
we didn't work
on our offense during practice.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.579
We have all season to do that.

27:03.823 --> 27:07.121
But what did we do in practice,
Mr. Stone?

27:07.893 --> 27:09.690
- Run.
- That's right.

27:09.895 --> 27:12.420
So, what do you think l want you
to do on offense tonight?

27:12.831 --> 27:15.026
- Run?
- Correct again.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.464
l want you to run.

27:17.669 --> 27:22.800
l want you to run every second
that clock is ticking, all game long.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.008
Put him back on the bench!

27:31.749 --> 27:35.480
Rebound! Rebound!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

27:39.924 --> 27:41.448
Nice pass, baby!

27:43.628 --> 27:45.323
Push it! Push it!

27:46.264 --> 27:47.993
- Screen.
- Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

27:48.499 --> 27:50.296
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

27:57.908 --> 28:00.206
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

28:00.410 --> 28:02.743
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

28:02.947 --> 28:05.744
White four, fifth.
He's out of the game.

28:05.982 --> 28:08.246
- Oh, ref, come--
- That's his fifth foul, coach.

28:08.485 --> 28:10.385
- Time, sir.
- Time out, white.

28:10.587 --> 28:13.055
Bad call, ref!
That was a jump ball, damn it!

28:13.290 --> 28:14.848
- Time out, white.
- Come on, fellas.

28:15.091 --> 28:17.650
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.225
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

28:19.428 --> 28:22.421
- Carter, you're in.
- But, coach, he a freshman.

28:22.632 --> 28:24.361
You wanna coach?

28:25.035 --> 28:28.266
All right, take a deep breath, guys.
Come on, deep breaths.

28:29.305 --> 28:31.102
- You tired?
- No, sir.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.101
Those guys are exhausted.

28:33.309 --> 28:35.174
That's why this guy's gonna miss
that free throw.

28:35.377 --> 28:38.403
When he does,
Worm and Lyle are our first option.

28:38.647 --> 28:41.980
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards, got that?

28:42.184 --> 28:44.277
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Richmond on three.

28:44.820 --> 28:46.447
- One, two, three!
- Richmond!

28:46.655 --> 28:49.283
- All right, let's out, all right?
- Step it up, let's go!

28:49.491 --> 28:51.356
Look alive out there.

28:52.827 --> 28:55.955
All right, guys, you're in better shape
than they are. Push it.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.758
Box out, box out.

28:59.901 --> 29:01.267
One shot.

29:08.242 --> 29:09.573
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

29:09.844 --> 29:11.505
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, baby!

29:20.655 --> 29:21.622
All right.

29:26.927 --> 29:28.519
Kenyon!

29:30.063 --> 29:31.894
- Worm!
- Yo, yo.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.965
Oh, yeah!

29:36.536 --> 29:38.526
Yeah! That's what l'm talking about!

29:45.646 --> 29:49.480
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.
- lt was all you.

29:49.683 --> 29:50.979
A win like that don't mean nothing,

29:51.183 --> 29:52.741
because they can't play anyway,
you feel me?

29:56.222 --> 30:00.319
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated
down low tonight. Any thoughts?

30:01.161 --> 30:04.323
l dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

30:04.530 --> 30:06.691
We the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

30:06.899 --> 30:09.697
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

30:09.935 --> 30:11.630
Yo, man, on the real,

30:11.837 --> 30:13.701
that was the worst game
l've ever seen in my life.

30:13.905 --> 30:16.373
l thought that shit would never end.
l was dying in the bleachers.

30:16.574 --> 30:18.542
That's right, you were in
the bleachers, weren't you?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.302
We were on the court
handling our business.

30:20.546 --> 30:22.741
That's right. We 1 -0, bitch.

30:22.982 --> 30:26.542
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B,
and y'all barely beat them.

30:26.785 --> 30:28.650
Damn, Timo,
why you throwing salt, man?

30:28.853 --> 30:31.515
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

30:31.723 --> 30:33.588
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.783
l'll knock all y'all off.

31:07.191 --> 31:09.853
- Yo. l'll check y'all later, all right?
- All right.

31:10.060 --> 31:12.619
Yo. Let's do this.

31:20.571 --> 31:21.902
- What's up?
- Here's two bundles.

31:22.106 --> 31:24.869
- All right.
- Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

31:25.108 --> 31:26.598
Yo, l got you.

31:28.611 --> 31:30.078
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.144
You look good.

31:32.482 --> 31:33.676
Got some paper for you.

31:35.217 --> 31:38.244
Now we're talking, yeah.

31:41.624 --> 31:42.818
How you living, Timo?

31:44.293 --> 31:46.158
l'm good.

31:47.295 --> 31:49.889
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

31:51.299 --> 31:53.233
- Here, take some.
- l'm all right.

31:53.435 --> 31:56.404
No, no, no, take some, please.

31:56.972 --> 31:59.406
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

32:02.077 --> 32:04.068
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me, thank you.

32:04.312 --> 32:05.870
You earned it.

32:09.617 --> 32:11.278
Take a nickel bag, okay?

32:12.219 --> 32:14.551
Go get yourself something, man.

32:17.125 --> 32:19.184
- l'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

32:19.394 --> 32:20.520
Okay, l'm gonna see you.

32:21.362 --> 32:23.262
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

32:41.248 --> 32:43.113
Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.

32:43.617 --> 32:45.277
Rafeca, l see you looking.

32:45.485 --> 32:48.386
Ain't nobody
thinking about you, Worm.

32:48.588 --> 32:50.488
- Oh, okay.
- Gentlemen,

32:50.690 --> 32:52.624
let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

32:52.826 --> 32:54.657
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

32:54.861 --> 32:58.092
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

32:58.298 --> 33:00.425
No, sir. l had 1 2 points
and eight assists, sir.

33:00.633 --> 33:05.093
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five
turnovers and four missed free throws.

33:06.973 --> 33:09.304
Now, we're talking
about fundamentals here.

33:09.508 --> 33:14.036
Until we learn them, l'm adding
a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

33:14.279 --> 33:18.410
- Six a.m.?
- We shot 56 percent at--

33:20.185 --> 33:21.743
Mr. Cruz.

33:22.221 --> 33:23.586
Are you lost, sir?

33:24.056 --> 33:25.250
What l gotta do to play?

33:25.457 --> 33:30.622
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

33:31.295 --> 33:33.024
Now, as l was saying,

33:33.231 --> 33:38.067
as a team,
we shot 56 percent from the line.

33:38.270 --> 33:41.068
From now on,
before you leave my gym,

33:41.306 --> 33:46.572
you must pay an exit price of 50
made free throws before you can go.

33:46.777 --> 33:48.608
- What?
- That's everybody.

33:48.813 --> 33:50.940
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

33:53.818 --> 33:55.786
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

33:56.354 --> 33:58.288
Before you can play on this team...

33:59.223 --> 34:01.384
...you owe me...

34:03.728 --> 34:06.161
...2,500 push-ups...

34:06.363 --> 34:07.990
...and 1 ,000 suicides.

34:08.198 --> 34:09.893
- Damn.
- Damn.

34:13.036 --> 34:15.767
And they must be
completed by Friday.

34:16.007 --> 34:18.804
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

34:19.843 --> 34:22.937
Today's flavor: offense.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.114
- Now we talking.
- Now, l have a sister.

34:25.315 --> 34:27.476
Her name is Linda.

34:27.918 --> 34:31.148
Linda is smart, she's political.

34:31.353 --> 34:33.548
Well, actually, she's radical.

34:33.756 --> 34:36.487
Linda's got a big Afro.

34:36.693 --> 34:40.561
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

34:40.963 --> 34:43.090
Before we get into that,
let's warm up.

34:43.732 --> 34:45.359
Give me a lay-up line.

34:45.601 --> 34:47.501
- Let's go.
- All right.

34:47.703 --> 34:49.330
Let's do it.

34:49.571 --> 34:52.301
- Damn, how many sisters he got?
- Who knows.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.338
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.877
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys, energy.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.570
We got this, let's go.

34:59.782 --> 35:01.044
- l'm open.
- l got him, l got him.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.808
Right here, right here.
l'm open. l'm open.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.314
l'm sorry.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.543
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

35:05.753 --> 35:06.845
- Come on.
- lt's not my fault.

35:07.055 --> 35:08.249
- He was early.
- Hey.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.120
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball,

35:11.326 --> 35:14.160
but you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

35:14.363 --> 35:18.389
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

35:18.599 --> 35:20.726
Okay. Switch it up.

35:20.969 --> 35:23.403
We got it, come on.
Let's go. Let's get it.

35:23.604 --> 35:26.539
- And call out them picks.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

35:28.442 --> 35:31.878
What is your deepest fear,
Mr. Cruz?

35:32.612 --> 35:34.638
That you're inadequate?

35:35.249 --> 35:36.614
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

35:38.519 --> 35:40.952
Go home.

35:44.825 --> 35:47.259
All right, l want seven passes
before you shoot.

35:47.461 --> 35:50.157
- Seven.
- All right.

35:50.629 --> 35:53.462
- l got him. l got him.
- Get that ball in there.

35:56.803 --> 35:59.601
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

36:03.709 --> 36:05.108
Move.

36:05.311 --> 36:07.404
Work it, work it.

36:09.115 --> 36:10.980
Run it back.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.405
What time your mom getting home?

36:35.608 --> 36:37.370
She doesn't get off for another hour.

36:46.384 --> 36:48.249
Oh, that's Myles.

36:48.453 --> 36:50.249
What?

37:04.501 --> 37:07.470
Say, ''Hi, Uncle Kenyon.''

37:07.704 --> 37:09.467
Say, ''Hi.''

37:09.673 --> 37:10.935
All right, don't worry about it.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.701
He'll go back to sleep
right after his bottle.

37:13.911 --> 37:15.139
Right, boo-boo?

37:15.345 --> 37:17.711
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

37:17.915 --> 37:20.383
Or when your cousin get back
from getting her hair fried and dyed,

37:20.584 --> 37:23.280
like she can afford all that shit.
lt's her baby anyway.

37:23.487 --> 37:26.683
Well, my mother had to work
a double shift,

37:26.889 --> 37:28.447
but they cut her overtime.

37:28.658 --> 37:30.956
And my cousin,
don't be trying to dis her.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.924
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

37:33.197 --> 37:35.892
Well, that's why we need
our own spot.

37:39.535 --> 37:40.866
Did you turn this off?

37:41.070 --> 37:44.267
- Yeah, it was boiling.
- Oh, come on.

37:44.474 --> 37:46.339
Well, turn it down, not off.

37:46.542 --> 37:50.341
This is milk, butter and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

37:50.679 --> 37:52.875
And hold him up.

37:58.653 --> 38:02.453
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.557
All right, Myles, here we go.

38:04.759 --> 38:07.250
Gotta cool off a minute.

38:13.435 --> 38:15.926
Ever think about what you were
gonna do before you were pregnant?

38:16.605 --> 38:18.368
What you mean,
going to junior college?

38:18.573 --> 38:19.733
Yeah.

38:19.941 --> 38:22.465
l mean, yeah, l thought about it.

38:22.776 --> 38:25.677
l could go later, l guess.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.542
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.711
Me too.

38:31.086 --> 38:33.713
- So l'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

38:33.921 --> 38:35.582
Why you asking me
all these questions?

38:35.789 --> 38:38.383
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

38:38.592 --> 38:41.425
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

38:42.630 --> 38:45.064
- l am holding him.
- You ain't doing it right.

38:45.265 --> 38:46.732
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

38:46.966 --> 38:48.490
Look...

38:50.370 --> 38:52.236
l don't know how to do this.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.137
You'll get it.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.809
Right?

39:00.813 --> 39:04.715
Look, l gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

39:05.485 --> 39:08.283
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

39:10.857 --> 39:12.381
Call me later, okay?

39:12.792 --> 39:14.487
Later.

39:18.298 --> 39:19.822
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.056
- Don't get lost in there.
- Move it. Move it.

39:23.902 --> 39:25.130
Stay with your man.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.005
- Box out, box out!
- Position.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.741
Guys...

39:32.077 --> 39:33.510
Up. Up.

39:33.712 --> 39:34.679
Hey, hey, hey.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.371
You don't get to your man, stand,
watch the ball.

39:37.583 --> 39:40.108
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position,

39:40.319 --> 39:43.254
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

39:43.454 --> 39:45.820
All right? Let's go.

39:46.057 --> 39:47.319
Run it. You got it.

39:47.558 --> 39:49.959
- Go on, do it.
- Forward pass. Forward pass.

39:50.162 --> 39:51.925
- Work it.
- There you go.

39:52.130 --> 39:55.326
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

39:55.533 --> 39:57.933
l wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, l'm here all week.

39:58.269 --> 40:00.237
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

40:00.438 --> 40:02.838
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1 -0.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.439
Very good.

40:04.642 --> 40:05.904
How may l help you?

40:06.743 --> 40:09.941
Well, l had my boys sign contracts

40:10.147 --> 40:12.809
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

40:13.284 --> 40:15.650
Yes, l believe one of the faculty
members mentioned that.

40:15.853 --> 40:17.718
Very interesting scare tactic.

40:19.422 --> 40:21.822
Well, in order for that
to be successful,

40:22.025 --> 40:24.653
l need their teachers to fill out
weekly progress reports

40:24.894 --> 40:27.920
so l'll know how the boys
are doing in their classrooms.

40:28.431 --> 40:30.865
- Okay.
- Well, l haven't received anything

40:31.067 --> 40:32.261
from their teachers.

40:35.338 --> 40:39.172
l don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

40:39.376 --> 40:43.243
Well, l took this job with the
understanding l could do it my way.

40:43.612 --> 40:44.840
And you can.

40:45.047 --> 40:46.810
Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

40:47.016 --> 40:48.449
l'll remember to bring it up.

40:48.652 --> 40:52.281
Why, that would be great.
Thank you, ma'am.

40:53.589 --> 40:55.386
Thank you, sir.

40:57.926 --> 40:59.894
Bring it in, guys.

41:00.696 --> 41:02.129
Let's go, hustle up.

41:02.331 --> 41:04.128
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

41:05.433 --> 41:07.298
All right, that's it for today.

41:07.502 --> 41:10.267
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

41:10.472 --> 41:14.909
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

41:15.811 --> 41:17.471
Clyde.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.844
Mr. Cruz.

41:29.157 --> 41:31.887
l'm impressed with
what you've done.

41:32.260 --> 41:34.626
But you came up short.

41:34.829 --> 41:37.627
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 push-ups.

41:39.467 --> 41:41.696
Please leave my gym.

41:43.637 --> 41:45.195
Thanks, Clyde.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.940
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

41:51.145 --> 41:52.406
l'll do push-ups for him.

41:58.285 --> 41:59.775
You said we're a team.

42:00.921 --> 42:03.582
One person struggles,
we all struggle.

42:04.223 --> 42:06.851
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

42:23.476 --> 42:25.000
l'll do some.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.772
l'll run suicides too.

43:04.214 --> 43:06.114
l'll do some too.

43:13.056 --> 43:15.286
Clyde, keep count.

43:17.528 --> 43:19.462
Call me when they're done.

43:23.967 --> 43:26.060
Defense! Defense!

43:26.270 --> 43:28.329
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

43:28.539 --> 43:29.801
Let's go.

43:30.574 --> 43:31.666
Ball, ball, ball.

43:33.143 --> 43:35.008
Ball, ball, ball.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.169
- Yeah!
- Go.

43:40.450 --> 43:42.145
Move your feet, move your feet.

43:42.852 --> 43:44.319
Go, defense. Go.

43:45.221 --> 43:46.746
Good job. Good job.

43:46.990 --> 43:48.183
- Worm.
- White ball.

43:48.391 --> 43:52.555
Palms up, move your feet, right?
Come out. Come out. Come out.

43:52.762 --> 43:54.252
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.027
Hey, hey.

43:59.668 --> 44:02.193
What is your deepest fear,
young man?

44:04.439 --> 44:05.566
Go on.

44:06.375 --> 44:09.242
Why he keep saying that, ''What's
your deepest fear?'' What that mean?

44:10.446 --> 44:12.413
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

44:12.647 --> 44:15.514
Move. Move. Move.

44:15.717 --> 44:17.548
No, one more pass.

44:25.727 --> 44:27.058
Hands up.

45:13.973 --> 45:15.167
Three points, Cruz!

45:17.410 --> 45:20.174
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

45:20.413 --> 45:22.642
You do that again and you're going
to be glued to the bench.

45:26.753 --> 45:28.516
- Swing it.
- Right here.

45:33.825 --> 45:35.224
Come on, last kick.

45:35.427 --> 45:37.918
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

45:46.605 --> 45:48.869
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

45:49.074 --> 45:51.304
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah. Delilah.

45:51.510 --> 45:53.876
Come on, come on, come on.

45:54.112 --> 45:56.579
- Shot.
- Yeah, Jason.

46:00.284 --> 46:01.308
Kenyon, pose for me.

46:02.486 --> 46:05.047
- Smile.
- Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

46:05.257 --> 46:07.418
Just play the damn game.

46:08.125 --> 46:10.218
Linda, Linda, Linda!

46:12.330 --> 46:14.798
There he is. Yeah.

46:14.999 --> 46:17.900
That's me, baby.
That's me. l did that.

46:18.102 --> 46:20.501
l drew that up. Yeah.

46:21.771 --> 46:23.034
Run it again.

46:24.108 --> 46:27.339
All right, 1 -4, 1 -4.
Linda, Linda, Linda!

46:31.948 --> 46:35.076
All day, baby. All day!
Can't stop that.

46:35.285 --> 46:37.185
Can't stop that!

46:38.321 --> 46:42.280
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

46:45.428 --> 46:47.658
Look at that bow. Look at that.

46:47.864 --> 46:50.594
l tied that. l tied that shit.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.768
Can l get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

46:53.737 --> 46:55.203
Are you crazy?

46:55.771 --> 46:57.762
What is wrong with you?

46:58.007 --> 47:00.237
What's wrong with all of you?

47:00.709 --> 47:04.009
Since when is winning not enough?

47:04.214 --> 47:07.580
Playing hard not enough?

47:08.017 --> 47:11.453
No, you have to humiliate
your opponent.

47:11.654 --> 47:14.452
Taunt him after every score.

47:14.923 --> 47:17.390
You won four games last season.

47:17.592 --> 47:18.786
Four.

47:18.993 --> 47:22.225
What gives you the right
to taint the game that l love

47:22.431 --> 47:25.127
with trash talk and taunting?

47:25.334 --> 47:28.633
What gives you the right to wear
Richmond on your chests

47:28.837 --> 47:29.928
and act like punks?

47:30.138 --> 47:32.572
- Coach, they were jawing too.
- So?

47:32.807 --> 47:34.399
You can't show some class?

47:34.642 --> 47:37.076
Act like a champion?

47:40.048 --> 47:42.744
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

47:43.284 --> 47:45.650
On the line. Now.

47:45.853 --> 47:48.845
- Damn.
- Oh, man, come on.

48:04.845 --> 48:08.145
Listen, shorty, l'm just gonna be real
with you, okay?

48:08.175 --> 48:10.302
You're my girl.

48:10.544 --> 48:13.945
l get out on that court
and everything is just getting crazy,

48:14.147 --> 48:16.876
all l gotta do is just think about you.

48:17.083 --> 48:18.277
Mr. Lyle.

48:18.584 --> 48:21.349
Why aren't you in...

48:22.422 --> 48:25.186
- ...geometry?
- l'm going there right now, sir.

48:26.026 --> 48:27.890
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

48:28.094 --> 48:29.959
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

48:30.162 --> 48:31.754
Go to class.

48:36.869 --> 48:40.326
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

48:40.538 --> 48:43.736
- So if any of you need extra time--
- Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

48:43.976 --> 48:46.035
- Yes.
- l...

48:47.046 --> 48:49.378
...don't see Junior Battle
in this class.

48:49.582 --> 48:52.482
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

48:52.684 --> 48:56.677
We rarely see him, but when we do,
it's always special.

48:58.790 --> 49:00.155
Thank you.

49:01.894 --> 49:04.885
''Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 1 9th.''

49:05.096 --> 49:07.792
- Top 20, baby.
- We're 1 9th, dog.

49:07.999 --> 49:10.263
''The Oilers have posted
a perfect 9-0 mark,

49:10.468 --> 49:12.459
winning on the road against
perennial powerhouses

49:12.704 --> 49:14.068
Xavier and Baxter Union.''

49:18.275 --> 49:19.765
Junior, you should read
the rest of this.

49:20.010 --> 49:21.808
They blowing you up
in this paper.

49:22.747 --> 49:25.374
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

49:25.582 --> 49:28.278
- Man, shut up.
- Shut up, Maddux.

49:29.853 --> 49:34.916
''Richmond center has been big
as the Oilers are 'boyed.'''

49:35.125 --> 49:39.060
Buoyed. The word is ''buoyed.''

49:40.097 --> 49:44.727
''Buoyed by Junior Battle's
1 9.8-rebound-a-night numbers.''

49:45.402 --> 49:48.599
See, that's my big nigga
right there, son. Hey.

49:48.838 --> 49:51.306
lf you was any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigga.

49:53.476 --> 49:54.943
Sit down. Sit down!

50:03.753 --> 50:10.317
''Nigger'' is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

50:11.260 --> 50:14.387
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

50:14.596 --> 50:17.429
Your using it teaches him to use it.

50:17.632 --> 50:20.625
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

50:20.870 --> 50:23.100
And when you're around me,
l don't wanna hear that shit.

50:23.339 --> 50:25.863
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

50:26.107 --> 50:27.540
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

50:27.742 --> 50:29.039
Yes, sir.

50:30.846 --> 50:32.473
Mr. Worm,

50:32.681 --> 50:35.149
what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

50:35.683 --> 50:38.983
To win that state championship, sir.

50:40.622 --> 50:44.217
Well, who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

50:44.693 --> 50:46.490
Hell if l know, sir.

50:47.494 --> 50:48.859
Does anybody know?

50:51.966 --> 50:53.456
Okay.

50:53.968 --> 50:56.528
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

51:00.407 --> 51:02.875
My father's in jail, sir.

51:06.413 --> 51:08.540
Well, l'm sorry to hear that, sir.

51:08.749 --> 51:11.273
But that doesn't have to be your life.

51:12.585 --> 51:14.052
My point's this:

51:14.254 --> 51:16.586
l have four seniors on this team,

51:16.789 --> 51:19.759
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

51:19.960 --> 51:23.725
All of whom l think can play
basketball at the college level.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.294
College.

51:26.366 --> 51:29.301
That's a viable option for all of you.

51:29.702 --> 51:33.637
But you have to perform in the
classroom to have that chance.

51:34.606 --> 51:36.369
You have to have a vision.

51:37.476 --> 51:41.504
Tell me, how do you
see yourselves?

51:43.683 --> 51:46.207
ESPN, baby.

51:46.618 --> 51:48.984
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

51:49.187 --> 51:53.681
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't
see you in his classroom very often.

51:54.159 --> 51:56.683
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

51:56.894 --> 51:58.886
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

52:00.599 --> 52:02.567
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

52:02.768 --> 52:04.531
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play

52:04.770 --> 52:08.330
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

52:08.572 --> 52:11.006
And that's a shout out
to the rest of you.

52:11.208 --> 52:12.607
You signed a contract.

52:12.810 --> 52:14.505
You made a commitment.

52:14.712 --> 52:17.910
Now, l have your schedules and l'll be
getting reports from your teachers.

52:18.483 --> 52:22.316
lf you don't perform in the
classroom, you will not play.

52:23.087 --> 52:24.918
What's up with that?

52:25.289 --> 52:27.120
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

52:29.660 --> 52:32.526
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

52:34.264 --> 52:38.133
Man, this is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

52:38.336 --> 52:41.362
That's 1 ,000 push-ups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

52:41.605 --> 52:43.765
You wanna try for 2,000?

53:00.223 --> 53:06.093
Young man, think about the choice
you're making if you walk out that door.

53:14.737 --> 53:16.706
To the baseline.

53:19.842 --> 53:24.006
All right. How about LaQuisha,
if it's a girl.

53:24.213 --> 53:28.707
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto
called and they want they name back.

53:28.917 --> 53:31.009
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

53:31.219 --> 53:33.517
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

53:33.721 --> 53:35.313
You're stupid.

53:35.523 --> 53:40.052
All right, l was thinking
l could call her Harmony.

53:40.295 --> 53:43.229
- l like Harmony.
- Harmony, oh, that's good. l like that.

53:43.431 --> 53:46.696
- What did Kenyon say?
- Please, he want a boy.

53:46.901 --> 53:49.267
- Figures.
- Speaking of Michael Jordan...

53:49.470 --> 53:50.869
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

53:51.205 --> 53:54.696
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

53:54.908 --> 53:57.275
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

53:58.379 --> 54:01.075
Guess he wants me all to himself.

54:01.282 --> 54:02.306
See you later.

54:02.517 --> 54:04.178
Don't forget,
l need your notes for history.

54:04.385 --> 54:07.581
- All right, l got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

54:09.656 --> 54:11.715
l bought us tickets to the dance.

54:12.559 --> 54:14.959
Why you telling these
loudmouth girls about the baby?

54:15.196 --> 54:17.129
Now everybody's gonna know.

54:17.330 --> 54:18.854
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

54:19.433 --> 54:22.266
- lt's not people's business, Kyra.
- Why you jumping down my throat?

54:22.469 --> 54:23.902
What's wrong with you?

54:24.938 --> 54:29.237
Look, me and coach been talking,
and he thinks l can play college ball.

54:29.442 --> 54:30.466
All right, so?

54:31.343 --> 54:33.868
So how am l gonna do that
and raise a baby?

54:36.650 --> 54:40.107
l don't know. l mean,
l'm not saying it won't be hard.

54:40.853 --> 54:42.718
Hard? lt's already hard.

54:42.922 --> 54:44.480
The kid ain't even here yet
and l'm worried

54:44.690 --> 54:47.818
about how l'm gonna feed it,
how l'm gonna pay for this and that.

54:48.327 --> 54:49.487
Everything.

54:49.895 --> 54:51.862
- l'm not ready.
- So, what are you saying?

54:52.097 --> 54:55.158
You want out?
ls that what you're saying?

54:55.401 --> 54:56.868
Go ahead and say it.

54:57.069 --> 54:59.833
Look, if l wanted to be out,
l would've been out by now, Kyra.

55:00.039 --> 55:01.734
That's not it at all. l love you.

55:02.141 --> 55:03.334
l wanna be with you.

55:03.541 --> 55:05.566
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

55:05.777 --> 55:07.142
l'm thinking about
what's best for us.

55:07.345 --> 55:09.575
You're not trying to think about
what's best for both of us,

55:09.781 --> 55:11.373
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

55:11.783 --> 55:15.219
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond.

55:15.420 --> 55:18.253
You wanna go play college ball.
So guess what?

55:18.456 --> 55:22.392
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

55:22.927 --> 55:25.487
l'm ready enough to do what
l gotta do all by my damn self.

55:25.730 --> 55:28.698
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

55:31.802 --> 55:32.962
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

55:33.170 --> 55:35.662
Look, ma'am, we talked about this.
l don't see what the problem is.

55:35.874 --> 55:37.398
Do you know what the APl is,
Mr. Carter?

55:37.609 --> 55:38.939
No, l don't.

55:39.143 --> 55:40.804
The Academic Performance lndex.

55:41.011 --> 55:44.037
They judge schools on a scale
of one to ten, ten being the best.

55:44.248 --> 55:46.682
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

55:46.884 --> 55:48.146
No, ma'am, l have no idea.

55:48.352 --> 55:51.081
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have
been for the last seven years.

55:51.287 --> 55:53.255
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

55:53.456 --> 55:55.823
So every year l have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

55:56.059 --> 55:58.994
- Look, ma'am--
- Can l ask what it is you want?

55:59.196 --> 56:01.095
- l want my boys to go to college.
- College?

56:01.330 --> 56:03.992
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50 percent of its students,

56:04.200 --> 56:05.497
the higher percentage being girls.

56:05.701 --> 56:08.568
Now, in my very educated opinion,
you have 1 5 players on your team,

56:08.771 --> 56:10.500
you'll be lucky to graduate
five of them.

56:10.706 --> 56:12.503
l'm sorry, ma'am,
but l don't agree with you.

56:12.708 --> 56:15.506
Look, these boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them--

56:15.711 --> 56:18.179
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

56:18.381 --> 56:23.011
- l suggest you start doing your job.
- And your job is to educate these kids.

56:23.219 --> 56:26.813
l suggest you start doing yours.

56:39.935 --> 56:41.562
Well...

56:42.137 --> 56:44.128
...we had another good week.

56:44.339 --> 56:47.671
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

56:48.409 --> 56:50.741
But l'm on my own.
You're never here.

56:50.945 --> 56:53.642
- lt gets crazy.
- Look, l appreciate everything you do.

56:53.848 --> 56:55.941
And l promise you-- We're closed.

56:56.151 --> 56:58.711
--as soon as the season is over,
l will be here for you.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.284
Mr. Carter?

57:00.588 --> 57:02.078
- l'm--
- Junior Battle's mother.

57:02.323 --> 57:03.847
Yes, ma'am, l remember you.

57:04.091 --> 57:06.719
Willa. Willa Battle.

57:08.128 --> 57:09.322
How may l help you, ma'am?

57:09.530 --> 57:10.929
Mr. Carter, l got a phone call today

57:11.130 --> 57:13.827
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

57:14.034 --> 57:16.059
Now, they wanna see
Junior play this Friday.

57:16.270 --> 57:18.602
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules--

57:18.806 --> 57:20.330
And l agree with them.

57:20.541 --> 57:23.100
l'm not here to argue
with your rules.

57:23.309 --> 57:24.901
l'm not.

57:27.747 --> 57:30.181
Almost two years ago now,

57:30.550 --> 57:34.680
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

57:35.388 --> 57:40.724
...killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me and for Junior.

57:41.828 --> 57:44.092
After you lose a son...

57:45.231 --> 57:50.224
...every time the phone rings,
your heart stops.

57:52.205 --> 57:54.730
Now, l'm not asking
for special attention.

57:54.941 --> 57:58.535
l agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

57:59.077 --> 58:02.706
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

58:02.914 --> 58:06.782
Now, l could move to the Hercules
school district, and he could play there.

58:06.985 --> 58:11.718
- But moving is not gonna solve--
- But l want him to play for you.

58:13.392 --> 58:14.757
Look, l'm not gonna stand here

58:14.960 --> 58:18.487
and say l know how it feels
to lose a son, because l don't.

58:19.331 --> 58:23.562
And l do appreciate you
putting your trust in me.

58:24.702 --> 58:26.567
But l need to hear that from Junior.

58:26.937 --> 58:28.700
He in the car.

58:33.844 --> 58:35.209
Junior!

58:46.089 --> 58:47.579
Go on.

58:52.997 --> 58:55.295
l'm sorry for what l said and did
at practice,

58:55.499 --> 58:58.592
and l promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

59:03.707 --> 59:06.039
Look me in the eye, sir.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.678
Everything inside me tells me
if l take you back,

59:13.917 --> 59:16.442
l'd be making a mistake
and you'll make a fool of me.

59:16.686 --> 59:18.586
No, sir.

59:21.223 --> 59:23.088
You owe me 1 ,000 push-ups

59:23.292 --> 59:25.954
and 1 ,000 suicides
before you can play.

59:26.328 --> 59:28.796
l'll see you at practice tomorrow.

59:31.033 --> 59:32.864
Thank you, sir.

59:41.944 --> 59:43.706
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

59:43.945 --> 59:45.970
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

59:46.180 --> 59:47.579
l don't know who you think you are.

59:47.815 --> 59:51.183
The next time you make a decision,
you better ask me first.

59:51.487 --> 59:53.853
Yo, Junior,
you did your thing tonight, man.

59:54.055 --> 59:56.683
- Good looking out, yo.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

59:56.891 --> 59:59.485
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

59:59.961 --> 1:00:04.159
l just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

1:00:04.365 --> 1:00:06.696
You have been invited.

1:00:06.900 --> 1:00:09.392
- Yeah!
- Yeah, baby!

1:00:13.508 --> 1:00:15.271
Now, l have more good news.

1:00:15.476 --> 1:00:17.568
l spoke to Principal Garrison today.

1:00:17.778 --> 1:00:21.646
She informs me that your teachers will
have your academic-progress reports

1:00:21.882 --> 1:00:23.782
prepared by the end
of holiday break.

1:00:23.984 --> 1:00:25.451
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

1:00:25.819 --> 1:00:27.548
Yo, not only are our grades
all right, coach,

1:00:27.754 --> 1:00:30.416
- but we undefeated, homeboy.
- Yeah!

1:00:31.825 --> 1:00:34.851
We undefeated
We undefeated

1:00:35.061 --> 1:00:39.293
We undefeated
We undefeated

1:00:39.499 --> 1:00:43.298
We undefeated
We undefeated

1:00:45.104 --> 1:00:48.596
Big ups to everybody who came out to
the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

1:00:48.809 --> 1:00:50.367
Get down!

1:01:12.898 --> 1:01:15.730
So give it up for the new
kings of Richmond, y'all!

1:01:15.934 --> 1:01:17.799
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

1:01:18.002 --> 1:01:19.936
Yo, we 1 2-0, y'all,
and l just wanna say

1:01:20.138 --> 1:01:22.800
l wanna see all the beautiful people
up at that tournament.

1:01:23.007 --> 1:01:24.531
You know!

1:01:24.742 --> 1:01:27.505
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on
the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

1:01:27.744 --> 1:01:29.440
when the Richmond Oilers
roll into town.

1:01:29.681 --> 1:01:31.876
Holla!

1:02:52.294 --> 1:02:54.626
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink!

1:02:54.829 --> 1:02:56.626
- You're pregnant, girl.
- Stop.

1:02:56.831 --> 1:02:58.059
lt's soda, all right?

1:02:58.266 --> 1:02:59.995
So why don't you just go
back downstairs

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:02.065
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

1:03:02.269 --> 1:03:04.499
lt ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

1:03:04.705 --> 1:03:06.367
- That ain't shit.
- Whatever.

1:03:06.575 --> 1:03:08.475
You shouldn't be here.
lf you're serious about this,

1:03:08.710 --> 1:03:10.473
you need to check this bullshit.
Because if not--

1:03:10.712 --> 1:03:13.942
lf not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold
my hand through an abortion?

1:03:14.148 --> 1:03:16.116
- ls that what you want?
- l don't know what l want.

1:03:16.317 --> 1:03:17.807
You so damn sure you wanna
have this baby,

1:03:18.052 --> 1:03:19.542
why don't you tell me how
it's gonna be.

1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:21.448
Everything's great, right?

1:03:21.655 --> 1:03:24.282
Your cousin is 1 9 with two kids
already, Kyra.

1:03:24.490 --> 1:03:25.855
lt's great?

1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:27.925
lt was great when we
was getting down.

1:03:28.128 --> 1:03:29.823
You ain't having no second
thoughts about that.

1:03:30.030 --> 1:03:32.328
You loved me
when it came to that.

1:03:34.335 --> 1:03:36.461
Look, Kyra, l can't tell you
what to do,

1:03:36.903 --> 1:03:39.667
but l look around and l see exactly
how l don't wanna live.

1:03:39.872 --> 1:03:41.169
Paycheck to paycheck?

1:03:41.407 --> 1:03:42.874
Dead-end job?

1:03:43.109 --> 1:03:45.441
You make it seem like everything's
gonna be all good,

1:03:45.645 --> 1:03:47.909
like everything's so wonderful.

1:03:48.881 --> 1:03:51.179
You don't care about me.

1:03:51.818 --> 1:03:55.549
You just wanna go to college,
play ball and forget about me.

1:03:55.888 --> 1:03:58.288
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.
- l don't care what you say.

1:03:58.490 --> 1:04:01.323
- l'm having this baby.
- And then what?

1:04:01.526 --> 1:04:02.993
You got everything figured out, right?

1:04:03.795 --> 1:04:06.094
So tell me what comes next.

1:04:32.090 --> 1:04:35.490
The third and final day of
the 22nd Bayhill Tournament

1:04:35.693 --> 1:04:37.752
finds the host team, Bayhill,

1:04:37.962 --> 1:04:42.126
trying to win the championship against
the surprising Richmond Oilers.

1:04:42.333 --> 1:04:43.732
Defense! Defense!

1:04:43.934 --> 1:04:45.333
Get your hands up!

1:04:50.841 --> 1:04:52.536
Get that ball!

1:05:01.918 --> 1:05:06.322
Richmond uses their last timeout with
1:20 remaining in the fourth quarter

1:05:06.524 --> 1:05:08.855
- and Bayhill up by six.
- Time out!

1:05:11.761 --> 1:05:14.286
Come on, man.
We still in the game. Come on.

1:05:24.641 --> 1:05:26.609
Don't panic.

1:05:27.343 --> 1:05:29.311
We're six down with 1 :20 left, right?

1:05:29.512 --> 1:05:31.343
We've been in these guys' ass
the whole game.

1:05:31.547 --> 1:05:32.741
We can do this.

1:05:32.948 --> 1:05:35.348
- This is our time, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:05:35.984 --> 1:05:38.612
All right, set up the 1 -4.
Run Candy.

1:05:38.821 --> 1:05:40.413
Damien's gonna hit the three.

1:05:40.622 --> 1:05:43.215
Kenyon, Lyle,
set a hard screen down here.

1:05:43.491 --> 1:05:46.052
When he hits the three,
go right into Diane.

1:05:46.261 --> 1:05:47.523
Pressure the inbound pass.

1:05:47.730 --> 1:05:49.357
Suffocate that pass.

1:05:49.565 --> 1:05:51.192
l want the ball back!

1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:53.231
- Come on, baby, lock up.
- Hands in.

1:05:53.435 --> 1:05:55.459
- Let's go.
- ''Our time'' on three!

1:05:55.703 --> 1:05:57.728
- One, two, three!
- Our time!

1:05:57.972 --> 1:05:59.337
Come on, let's go.

1:06:07.115 --> 1:06:08.946
One, two, three, Cougars!

1:06:09.150 --> 1:06:10.777
Let's go, guys!

1:06:17.058 --> 1:06:19.617
1 -4! 1 -4! Candy!

1:06:19.826 --> 1:06:23.422
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Ball, ball, ball, ball!

1:06:24.165 --> 1:06:25.723
Watch him!

1:06:27.201 --> 1:06:31.159
- Watch your back! Come in!
- Watch the screen!

1:06:31.471 --> 1:06:33.371
Make the shot, Damien!

1:06:37.477 --> 1:06:39.308
Diane! Diane!

1:06:39.513 --> 1:06:40.810
Defense!

1:06:44.050 --> 1:06:46.109
Go, go, go. Ball, ball, ball.

1:06:47.020 --> 1:06:49.079
Right there, right there. l got him.

1:06:51.091 --> 1:06:53.024
- Off him, man. Off him.
- Richmond's ball!

1:06:53.225 --> 1:06:54.954
Richmond's ball!

1:06:55.394 --> 1:06:56.418
Yeah!

1:07:00.366 --> 1:07:03.200
Kenyon! Kenyon!
Hattie Jean! Hattie Jean!

1:07:03.436 --> 1:07:05.630
Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean,
Hattie Jean!

1:07:05.871 --> 1:07:07.930
- D up!
- Check! Check!

1:07:11.977 --> 1:07:13.274
- Get there!
- Right there!

1:07:19.651 --> 1:07:20.913
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1:07:21.653 --> 1:07:24.282
Move your feet!
Move your feet!

1:07:34.499 --> 1:07:36.262
A foul, ref!

1:07:40.237 --> 1:07:42.706
Right wing, Kenyon, wing!

1:07:49.214 --> 1:07:51.841
Richmond takes the lead
for the first time in the game,

1:07:52.049 --> 1:07:54.813
7 8 to 7 6.

1:08:00.490 --> 1:08:03.653
Slow the ball down!
Slow the ball down!

1:08:05.062 --> 1:08:08.054
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!

1:08:11.235 --> 1:08:13.328
Defense! Defense!

1:08:19.242 --> 1:08:23.543
- That's a charge! Driving!
- Basket's good!

1:08:24.281 --> 1:08:28.683
The basket counts,
and the Cougars have tied the game.

1:08:30.620 --> 1:08:32.520
That was a bad call, ref!

1:08:36.759 --> 1:08:38.988
- Basket counts! One shot!
- That's a charge!

1:08:39.194 --> 1:08:42.426
- Foul's on red five. On the block.
- Don't tie me like that!

1:08:43.299 --> 1:08:45.392
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1:08:45.635 --> 1:08:47.660
Please get in the box?
Please get your head in the game!

1:08:47.904 --> 1:08:49.132
Give me a break!

1:08:49.337 --> 1:08:51.567
Cruz. ln for Lyle.

1:08:52.073 --> 1:08:54.940
- Kenyon! Damien!
- Sub, for five.

1:08:55.477 --> 1:08:57.001
Let's go.

1:08:57.812 --> 1:09:00.543
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1:09:00.750 --> 1:09:03.274
The ball's coming to you, Kenyon.
Run Linda. Run Linda.

1:09:03.485 --> 1:09:05.350
You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

1:09:05.553 --> 1:09:07.714
Do it. Let's go.
Come on, sirs. Hurry.

1:09:07.923 --> 1:09:09.948
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

1:09:11.126 --> 1:09:13.821
Let's go! Let's go!

1:09:14.862 --> 1:09:16.591
One shot.

1:09:17.097 --> 1:09:19.224
Backboard D!
Backboard D!

1:09:30.377 --> 1:09:34.871
And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead
with nine seconds left.

1:09:35.082 --> 1:09:38.482
Go to war, Miss Margaret,
this is a tight one.

1:09:38.685 --> 1:09:40.381
Let's go, let's go!

1:09:41.522 --> 1:09:42.887
Linda! Linda!

1:09:43.090 --> 1:09:45.388
Watch the pick! Watch the pick!

1:09:50.663 --> 1:09:53.188
Stop the ball! Stop the ball!

1:09:55.301 --> 1:09:57.701
lt's not there! lt's not there!
To the hole! To the hole!

1:09:59.271 --> 1:10:00.739
Watch it!

1:10:03.076 --> 1:10:04.338
D up, man!

1:10:09.716 --> 1:10:11.239
Yeah!

1:10:31.703 --> 1:10:33.330
lt's all right, man.

1:10:36.207 --> 1:10:39.371
- Nice game. Nice game.
- Good game, coach. Thank you, sir.

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:44.612
Rich what? Richmond!

1:10:44.816 --> 1:10:47.579
Rich what? Richmond!

1:10:47.785 --> 1:10:50.049
Rich what? Richmond!

1:10:51.555 --> 1:10:53.216
Line up! Line up!
Let's shake hands.

1:10:53.424 --> 1:10:55.517
That's what l'm talking
about, coach.

1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:58.895
- Way to go, Lyle. Good game, son.
- Love you, Dad.

1:10:59.096 --> 1:11:00.495
Ladies and gentlemen,
l now present

1:11:00.731 --> 1:11:04.189
the 22nd Annual Bayhill Tournament
championship trophy

1:11:04.435 --> 1:11:06.562
to Richmond High School.

1:11:27.524 --> 1:11:29.355
Hey, number three.

1:11:34.563 --> 1:11:37.555
- Nice game.
- Thank you.

1:11:42.605 --> 1:11:44.162
Okay, cool.

1:11:56.417 --> 1:11:58.716
- All right, come on.
- All right.

1:11:58.921 --> 1:12:00.684
Watch his door.

1:12:05.594 --> 1:12:08.153
Yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.

1:12:26.247 --> 1:12:27.839
Load up, load up.

1:12:45.765 --> 1:12:46.754
Tonya, guess what.

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.093
We won the whole thing.

1:12:50.570 --> 1:12:52.595
That's right, 1 6-0.

1:12:52.839 --> 1:12:54.499
Oh, and here's the best part:

1:12:54.707 --> 1:12:57.074
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1:12:57.277 --> 1:12:58.505
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:12:58.712 --> 1:13:00.373
l shouldn't tell you that.
He should tell you.

1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:03.378
l'll wake him up so he can tell you.
Hold on.

1:13:05.051 --> 1:13:07.382
Why don't you try their doorbell
with your ghetto self. Move.

1:13:07.586 --> 1:13:09.349
Can you reach that?

1:13:16.463 --> 1:13:18.692
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.

1:13:18.931 --> 1:13:21.399
Oh, you know, we try to be
up in here, baby.

1:13:23.936 --> 1:13:25.426
Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1:13:38.217 --> 1:13:41.344
Know what? He must be
in somebody else's room.

1:13:54.298 --> 1:13:56.824
Like l was saying, you know,
l'm Junior Battle. l'm the man.

1:13:58.203 --> 1:13:59.761
- That's what l'm talking about.
- l know.

1:13:59.971 --> 1:14:02.940
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.

1:14:15.886 --> 1:14:17.353
Yo!

1:14:18.488 --> 1:14:19.887
You looking for your team?

1:14:20.457 --> 1:14:21.788
Yes, sir.

1:14:22.626 --> 1:14:26.153
Oh, baby. Hard biz.
Know what l'm saying?

1:14:26.396 --> 1:14:29.728
This is my style right here.
l'm amazing. Feel me, Lyle?

1:14:29.932 --> 1:14:31.661
Hey, yo, Lyle.
Let me get a coochie juice.

1:14:31.867 --> 1:14:34.233
l got you, dog. l got you.

1:14:34.437 --> 1:14:36.030
- Yo, Worm!
- What up, dog?

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:37.867
- Damien!
- Yeah?

1:14:38.075 --> 1:14:39.564
l'm open!

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:41.636
Damien!

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.813
- Damien, are you drunk?
- No. l don't drink.

1:14:49.018 --> 1:14:50.882
- Sorry about the thing.
- lt's okay.

1:14:51.086 --> 1:14:53.554
- l see you!
- l see you too.

1:14:53.755 --> 1:14:57.385
- l see her!
- Why don't we go swimming.

1:14:57.593 --> 1:14:59.458
- We're going swimming?
- Yeah.

1:14:59.695 --> 1:15:01.128
Hey, l'm going swimming!

1:15:01.796 --> 1:15:04.287
l'm going swimming!

1:15:05.533 --> 1:15:08.001
You're going swimming
with the MVP!

1:15:08.236 --> 1:15:10.431
MVP!

1:15:22.651 --> 1:15:25.744
This water's probably
cold as hell, shorty. l don't know.

1:15:25.953 --> 1:15:28.285
And swimming ain't my cup of tea,
baby. Know what l'm saying?

1:15:28.489 --> 1:15:31.390
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1:15:31.592 --> 1:15:34.255
- We don't have bathing suits.
- Right.

1:15:34.496 --> 1:15:36.464
Neither do we.

1:15:39.333 --> 1:15:40.664
Oh, so it's like that?

1:15:40.868 --> 1:15:42.563
Show me the money, then,
know what l'm saying?

1:15:42.770 --> 1:15:45.500
- Damn!
- Since it's like that.

1:15:51.277 --> 1:15:55.078
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1:15:55.549 --> 1:15:59.451
- Damn!
- You are looking right.

1:15:59.653 --> 1:16:01.552
l like that.

1:16:02.221 --> 1:16:03.483
You guys coming?

1:16:03.690 --> 1:16:05.988
We're getting in there.

1:16:06.559 --> 1:16:09.585
l gotta take my chain off
so it don't turn green.

1:16:11.264 --> 1:16:13.528
Oh, man, l can't believe this.

1:16:14.901 --> 1:16:16.232
Heaven!

1:16:37.322 --> 1:16:38.983
Excuse me.

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:43.624
- Can l help you?
- l'm Ken Carter,

1:16:43.829 --> 1:16:45.626
coach of the Richmond High
basketball team.

1:16:46.064 --> 1:16:47.553
Richmond?

1:16:48.299 --> 1:16:50.893
- You're a little lost, aren't you?
- Well, l'm looking for my son.

1:16:51.102 --> 1:16:54.834
The cab driver told me he dropped
the team off here for a party.

1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:56.564
Excuse me.

1:17:38.815 --> 1:17:40.339
Oh, my God, is that--?

1:17:40.550 --> 1:17:42.108
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1:17:42.318 --> 1:17:44.309
You see your son?

1:17:45.187 --> 1:17:46.848
Yes, sir, l do.

1:17:52.595 --> 1:17:54.392
Damien Carter.

1:17:54.864 --> 1:17:57.457
Get your ass out of that pool.

1:17:58.167 --> 1:17:59.634
Yes, sir.

1:17:59.768 --> 1:18:02.293
Richmond High players, let's go!

1:18:03.205 --> 1:18:05.730
- Coach!
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1:18:05.941 --> 1:18:07.499
Worm?

1:18:08.876 --> 1:18:10.468
What up, coach?

1:18:10.678 --> 1:18:12.704
l got somebody l want
you to meet.

1:18:13.015 --> 1:18:16.610
Now, l just met her,
but she is fine as hell.

1:18:16.819 --> 1:18:19.616
- Her name is...
- Susan!

1:18:19.854 --> 1:18:22.049
- Susan. He right!
- Oh, shit.

1:18:22.290 --> 1:18:25.088
My daughter, Susan.

1:18:26.127 --> 1:18:30.029
You are not going to like
what happens in practice on Monday.

1:18:30.231 --> 1:18:32.461
You think you've run for me before?

1:18:32.667 --> 1:18:37.195
l come to your rooms to celebrate
with you, and you sneak--

1:18:40.174 --> 1:18:43.267
l end up taking a road trip
to the suburbs,

1:18:43.477 --> 1:18:46.037
where l find my
drunk-ass point guard

1:18:46.246 --> 1:18:48.544
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1:18:49.115 --> 1:18:52.608
Actually, l was on the bottom, coach.
She was on the top.

1:18:52.854 --> 1:18:55.321
Worm, do you wanna be
on this team?

1:18:55.522 --> 1:18:58.116
Because you're about six words
from getting kicked off

1:18:58.358 --> 1:19:01.191
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1:19:01.394 --> 1:19:03.658
Cruz, open your eyes!

1:19:04.331 --> 1:19:06.060
Ghetto hoop stars!

1:19:06.432 --> 1:19:09.993
Signing autographs
and humping the honeys!

1:19:10.470 --> 1:19:13.303
Well, l'm gonna show you
what humping is.

1:19:13.807 --> 1:19:17.436
Coach, we won the tournament.

1:19:17.644 --> 1:19:18.974
We undefeated.

1:19:19.178 --> 1:19:21.271
l mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:22.811
Winners?

1:20:36.620 --> 1:20:38.713
Oh, no.

1:20:39.522 --> 1:20:41.922
Oh, no, no, no.

1:20:42.124 --> 1:20:44.684
Oh, no!

1:20:48.932 --> 1:20:50.559
God--!

1:21:01.711 --> 1:21:04.042
You guys are awesome!

1:21:17.459 --> 1:21:19.017
What's up, Cruz?

1:21:19.227 --> 1:21:20.421
l don't know.

1:21:20.629 --> 1:21:23.257
Coach giving us a day off, l guess.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.991
Yo, l don't even know where
the library's even at.

1:21:28.203 --> 1:21:30.296
- l bet you don't.
- ''Library's at''?

1:21:30.505 --> 1:21:32.735
He don't know
where the library's at.

1:21:47.789 --> 1:21:49.380
Quiet.

1:21:50.891 --> 1:21:52.483
Quiet!

1:21:53.527 --> 1:21:57.019
Gentlemen, in this hand,
l hold contracts

1:21:57.264 --> 1:21:59.630
signed by me and signed by you.

1:21:59.767 --> 1:22:04.430
ln this hand, l hold academic-progress
reports prepared by your teachers.

1:22:05.038 --> 1:22:07.633
We have six players failing
at least one class,

1:22:07.841 --> 1:22:11.937
eight players getting incompletes
based on attendance.

1:22:12.179 --> 1:22:15.341
Gentlemen, you have failed to up--

1:22:16.049 --> 1:22:17.573
No, l'm sorry.

1:22:18.217 --> 1:22:20.276
We have failed.

1:22:20.653 --> 1:22:22.587
We have failed each other.

1:22:23.189 --> 1:22:25.679
Now, there are some of you
who have upheld this contract.

1:22:25.891 --> 1:22:29.293
But know that we are a team.

1:22:29.495 --> 1:22:32.396
And until we all meet the terms
of this contract,

1:22:32.598 --> 1:22:34.327
the gym will remain locked.

1:22:34.534 --> 1:22:35.727
- Locked?
- What?

1:22:35.934 --> 1:22:38.129
- What you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?

1:22:38.336 --> 1:22:40.236
- He must mean for the day.
- Mr. Thompson,

1:22:40.439 --> 1:22:43.670
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have
generously volunteered their time

1:22:43.875 --> 1:22:45.365
to help us reach our goals.

1:22:45.610 --> 1:22:47.203
But, coach, l have a 3.3.

1:22:47.446 --> 1:22:48.811
That's good, sir.

1:22:49.014 --> 1:22:51.039
Do you score all the points
for the team too?

1:22:54.319 --> 1:22:57.083
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1:22:57.889 --> 1:23:00.516
Do you know what Oilers
stands for?

1:23:03.928 --> 1:23:05.793
Sir?

1:23:06.598 --> 1:23:09.396
Know that you're not just
walking out on me.

1:23:09.601 --> 1:23:11.625
You're walking out on them.

1:23:12.436 --> 1:23:14.336
l had to beg you.

1:23:16.140 --> 1:23:18.734
And then l ran all those sprints.

1:23:19.543 --> 1:23:21.010
l did all that shit.

1:23:21.245 --> 1:23:25.340
l killed myself for you, sir,
to get back on the team.

1:23:28.853 --> 1:23:30.616
This is bullshit.

1:23:53.543 --> 1:23:56.512
You put a lock on the gym and forced
them to meet you in the library?

1:23:56.746 --> 1:23:58.235
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison.

1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:00.471
l'm surprised you know
where my office is.

1:24:00.716 --> 1:24:02.240
Take the lock off that gym.

1:24:02.484 --> 1:24:03.951
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1:24:04.153 --> 1:24:05.746
Maybe someone on the other end
of that phone

1:24:05.955 --> 1:24:07.650
has a solution to our problem.

1:24:07.857 --> 1:24:10.950
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter,
but your methods are a bit extreme.

1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:13.094
You painted an extreme picture.

1:24:13.295 --> 1:24:16.128
No one expects them to graduate,
no one expects them to go to college.

1:24:16.565 --> 1:24:19.090
So you take away basketball,
the one area of their lives

1:24:19.301 --> 1:24:21.200
- where they have some success?
- Yes, ma'am.

1:24:21.402 --> 1:24:23.029
And you challenge them
academically?

1:24:23.237 --> 1:24:24.966
- Yes, ma'am.
- And what if they fail?

1:24:25.174 --> 1:24:27.267
Then we've failed.

1:24:29.111 --> 1:24:31.102
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter,
both you and l know

1:24:31.346 --> 1:24:33.575
that for some of these kids,
this basketball season

1:24:33.781 --> 1:24:36.375
will be the highlight of their lives.

1:24:37.351 --> 1:24:40.946
Well, l think that's the problem.
Don't you?

1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:08.247
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.

1:25:08.448 --> 1:25:10.211
Quite the Pandora's box
you've opened.

1:25:10.417 --> 1:25:11.850
Oh, l get all the blame now?

1:25:12.052 --> 1:25:14.919
Let's just say l'm happy to give you
all the credit.

1:25:15.121 --> 1:25:18.352
l've got every news reporter in town
waiting to speak to you.

1:25:18.558 --> 1:25:21.253
Got a press conference set up
around the front of the gymnasium.

1:25:21.694 --> 1:25:23.719
Coach Carter has taken the lockout
to the next level

1:25:23.929 --> 1:25:25.659
by canceling last night's game.

1:25:25.866 --> 1:25:29.427
Richmond forfeited the game,
making it their first loss of the season.

1:25:29.636 --> 1:25:31.432
And for now,
the lock remains on the gym.

1:25:31.637 --> 1:25:33.400
Here he comes.
Here he comes now.

1:25:33.639 --> 1:25:37.769
Coach Carter! Coach!
Can l get a question?

1:25:38.410 --> 1:25:41.402
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
l'd like to thank you for your patience.

1:25:41.647 --> 1:25:44.411
At this time, l'd like to introduce
Coach Ken Carter.

1:25:44.617 --> 1:25:46.881
You may direct
your questions to him.

1:25:47.086 --> 1:25:51.682
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players
whose grades qualify them to play?

1:25:51.891 --> 1:25:53.585
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1:25:53.791 --> 1:25:56.123
We support each other
on and off the court.

1:25:56.327 --> 1:25:58.659
Anybody still think coach
bluffing now?

1:25:58.863 --> 1:26:01.457
l feel like running right up
in the middle of all those reporters

1:26:01.666 --> 1:26:04.101
and telling them l think this
is bullshit, son.

1:26:04.303 --> 1:26:06.668
Maybe you should've gone
to class, Lyle.

1:26:06.905 --> 1:26:09.635
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.

1:26:09.874 --> 1:26:12.843
- lt's Junior they should've locked out.
- Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1:26:13.044 --> 1:26:16.377
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.
- Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1:26:16.581 --> 1:26:19.310
- Junior, if you need help, l'll tutor you.
- Man, l don't need no help.

1:26:19.516 --> 1:26:21.177
Well, he ain't lock us out
for no reason.

1:26:22.519 --> 1:26:24.818
We been tripping lately, man.
All y'all know it.

1:26:25.023 --> 1:26:27.389
How do you think the community's
gonna react to this lockout?

1:26:27.592 --> 1:26:30.685
l'm not really sure. l hope
they'll support these young men.

1:26:30.894 --> 1:26:32.885
What, man?

1:26:33.096 --> 1:26:35.326
No, man, it's just funny, dog,
because, Junior, man,

1:26:35.532 --> 1:26:38.729
you thought it was bad all us knew
your dumb ass was failing science.

1:26:38.969 --> 1:26:41.436
Now the whole world about to know
your dumb ass failing science.

1:26:41.671 --> 1:26:44.368
- Man.
- Hey, man.

1:26:46.276 --> 1:26:49.245
And you have Fremont this Saturday,
the biggest game on your schedule.

1:26:49.479 --> 1:26:53.312
Now, Richmond is gonna riot
if you forfeit that game.

1:26:53.516 --> 1:26:55.074
Saturday is a long way off.

1:26:55.284 --> 1:26:57.218
We'll see what happens.
Thank you all for coming.

1:26:57.420 --> 1:26:59.888
That's all the time l have right now.
l have to get back to work.

1:27:00.089 --> 1:27:02.991
Coach, have you talked to any
of the parents?

1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:05.655
Thank you for your time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:27:05.861 --> 1:27:08.523
l'd like to remind you that classes
are in session,

1:27:08.731 --> 1:27:11.097
so as you leave campus,
please do so quietly.

1:27:12.735 --> 1:27:13.929
l ain't turning the cheek.

1:27:14.170 --> 1:27:16.569
He come up in my 'hood,
l'm serious, it's on.

1:27:16.771 --> 1:27:19.001
- Young sirs.
- lt's always been like that.

1:27:19.207 --> 1:27:21.175
lt's been a long day.

1:27:21.376 --> 1:27:24.369
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1:27:24.580 --> 1:27:28.675
Let's take this time to say whatever it is
we want while the doors are closed.

1:27:28.883 --> 1:27:32.478
You have the floor.
This is about us.

1:27:32.687 --> 1:27:36.020
Man, this shit ain't about us.
This is all about Coach Carter.

1:27:36.224 --> 1:27:37.953
We're the basketball team.

1:27:38.159 --> 1:27:41.616
All l see is you on TV,
getting famous, eating that shit up.

1:27:41.830 --> 1:27:44.128
- ls that all you see?
- lt's all l see.

1:27:44.332 --> 1:27:46.095
You ain't lying.

1:27:46.668 --> 1:27:48.226
Well, let me tell you what l see.

1:27:49.204 --> 1:27:53.936
l see a system that's designed
for you to fail.

1:27:54.375 --> 1:27:56.969
Now, l know you all like stats,
so let me give you some.

1:27:57.277 --> 1:28:00.974
Richmond High only graduates
50 percent of its students.

1:28:01.181 --> 1:28:06.346
And of those that do graduate,
only 6 percent go to college.

1:28:06.553 --> 1:28:11.513
Which tells me, when l walk down
the halls and l look in your classrooms,

1:28:11.725 --> 1:28:15.990
maybe only one student
is going to go to college.

1:28:16.462 --> 1:28:20.057
''Well, damn, Coach Carter, if l ain't
going to college, where l'm gonna go?''

1:28:20.299 --> 1:28:22.393
Now, that's a great question.

1:28:22.636 --> 1:28:28.073
And the answer for young
African-American men in here is this:

1:28:28.307 --> 1:28:30.207
probably to prison.

1:28:30.610 --> 1:28:34.546
ln this county,
33 percent of black males

1:28:34.747 --> 1:28:39.183
between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.

1:28:40.385 --> 1:28:42.115
So look at the guy on your left.

1:28:43.022 --> 1:28:45.422
Now look at the guy on your right.

1:28:46.659 --> 1:28:48.956
One of you is going
to get arrested.

1:28:49.628 --> 1:28:51.323
Growing up here in Richmond,

1:28:51.530 --> 1:28:56.160
you're 80 percent more likely
to go to prison than college.

1:28:56.868 --> 1:28:59.336
Those are the numbers.

1:29:00.137 --> 1:29:02.333
Those are some stats for your ass.

1:29:03.108 --> 1:29:05.440
Now, l want you to go home...

1:29:05.877 --> 1:29:08.072
...and look at your lives tonight...

1:29:08.713 --> 1:29:11.113
...and look at your parents' lives...

1:29:11.682 --> 1:29:14.651
...and ask yourself, ''Do l want better?''

1:29:15.386 --> 1:29:17.547
lf the answer is yes,

1:29:17.788 --> 1:29:19.949
l'll see you here tomorrow.

1:29:20.826 --> 1:29:22.657
And l promise you...

1:29:23.627 --> 1:29:26.926
...l will do everything in my power

1:29:27.164 --> 1:29:28.859
to get you to college

1:29:29.100 --> 1:29:31.330
and to a better life.

1:29:58.060 --> 1:30:01.690
l don't understand this.
lt's a letter, how can it be a number?

1:30:01.998 --> 1:30:03.590
How are balancing
those equations coming?

1:30:03.833 --> 1:30:06.802
- l can't do this.
- Hold on. Come on, son.

1:30:07.003 --> 1:30:08.163
Don't give up yet, son.

1:30:08.371 --> 1:30:11.168
Here's a story out of California
that's getting national attention.

1:30:11.373 --> 1:30:14.206
The entire boys' basketball team
at Richmond High School

1:30:14.409 --> 1:30:15.740
has been benched.

1:30:15.944 --> 1:30:18.469
The highly ranked Oilers have
a perfect season on the court,

1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:21.081
but some players were
in big trouble academically.

1:30:21.283 --> 1:30:25.185
And in an unprecedented move,
Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,

1:30:25.387 --> 1:30:28.823
locked the gym and sent his players
straight to the library.

1:30:29.024 --> 1:30:30.184
Now, at the start of the season,

1:30:30.392 --> 1:30:32.985
l understand you made all of
your players sign a contract

1:30:33.227 --> 1:30:34.524
before they could join the team.

1:30:34.762 --> 1:30:36.787
What exactly were the conditions
of that contract?

1:30:37.031 --> 1:30:39.500
The contract states that
the players must maintain

1:30:39.735 --> 1:30:41.293
a 2.3 grade point average

1:30:41.537 --> 1:30:43.903
and that the players must
attend all their classes

1:30:44.106 --> 1:30:46.437
and sit in the front row
of those classes.

1:30:46.641 --> 1:30:49.735
Well, Coach Carter, it's an
unusual strategy, and a risky one

1:30:49.944 --> 1:30:51.809
in a sense, in light of
your team's winning record,

1:30:52.013 --> 1:30:55.141
but l think there's gonna be a lot of
people out there pleased to learn

1:30:55.349 --> 1:30:58.978
that at least somebody still cares
about the concept of a student athlete.

1:30:59.187 --> 1:31:00.882
Thanks a lot for joining us today.

1:31:07.195 --> 1:31:08.354
l'm sorry to disturb you.

1:31:08.595 --> 1:31:11.530
l'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond
High School basketball team.

1:31:11.731 --> 1:31:12.857
Oh, yeah.

1:31:13.099 --> 1:31:14.726
l need to ask you a favor.

1:31:14.935 --> 1:31:18.098
My team is studying in the library,
and l've been trying to tell them

1:31:18.306 --> 1:31:20.273
that brains and beauty
are a perfect combination.

1:31:20.473 --> 1:31:21.440
Know what l'm saying?

1:31:21.641 --> 1:31:23.370
l mean, l'm Worm, baby.

1:31:23.577 --> 1:31:25.477
How would you like
to watch the Worm work?

1:31:25.679 --> 1:31:27.613
Hey, where did you get
that backpack?

1:31:27.814 --> 1:31:28.906
Watch out, Too Short.

1:31:29.115 --> 1:31:34.575
Why study earth science
or history or algebra?

1:31:35.421 --> 1:31:40.189
Getting good grades in those subjects,
combined with basketball skills,

1:31:40.427 --> 1:31:43.395
can get you into college.

1:31:43.629 --> 1:31:46.530
Girl, you should've bought it.
l would've worn it.

1:31:56.007 --> 1:31:58.977
You selfish son of a bitch.
You snake.

1:31:59.178 --> 1:32:01.408
- Miss--
- No, no, don't ''miss'' me, snake.

1:32:01.614 --> 1:32:03.081
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1:32:03.282 --> 1:32:06.079
Now, after all the things that my son
has been through for your team,

1:32:06.284 --> 1:32:08.479
for you to go lock up
this gym like this, how dare you...

1:32:25.203 --> 1:32:26.693
Open up the damn gym!

1:32:26.904 --> 1:32:29.099
Let the boys play!

1:32:34.077 --> 1:32:35.874
What's up, little cousin?

1:32:36.079 --> 1:32:38.014
How you doing?

1:32:38.383 --> 1:32:39.475
Got something for me?

1:32:41.451 --> 1:32:42.941
That's what l'm talking about.

1:32:53.429 --> 1:32:56.262
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.

1:32:58.201 --> 1:32:59.725
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.

1:32:59.936 --> 1:33:02.336
- Yeah? Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.

1:33:02.539 --> 1:33:04.335
- Yeah. How you like that?
- Oh, hell no.

1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:06.735
- What? What?
- You wanna get out the car?

1:33:06.942 --> 1:33:09.172
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

1:33:09.378 --> 1:33:11.369
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.

1:33:13.883 --> 1:33:15.373
Trust me, you don't want me
out this car.

1:33:15.584 --> 1:33:17.142
Yeah, see? Yeah.

1:33:17.887 --> 1:33:19.218
- Get on!
- Don't be no punk.

1:33:19.455 --> 1:33:20.422
Say what you gotta say.

1:33:20.623 --> 1:33:22.648
- Come on back, punk.
- Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1:33:22.892 --> 1:33:24.052
No, l ain't letting nothing go.

1:33:24.293 --> 1:33:27.819
These people in Richmond--
Goddamn it!

1:33:28.196 --> 1:33:29.163
- Relax, Dad.
- Damn it!

1:33:29.364 --> 1:33:32.265
Relax, relax. Chill out.
lt's over. lt's over. All right?

1:33:32.467 --> 1:33:34.697
He doesn't mean anything. lt's over.

1:33:34.903 --> 1:33:36.132
Let it go.

1:33:36.339 --> 1:33:38.671
Come on, get back in the car.
Let's go.

1:34:56.983 --> 1:34:59.349
l think you know who she is,
but she's got a friend.

1:34:59.585 --> 1:35:01.211
l mean, dog...
You gotta hook me up.

1:35:01.453 --> 1:35:04.115
Why l always gotta hook him up?
Sound like l'm the Love Connection.

1:35:04.356 --> 1:35:06.256
Just start a conversation.
l'll take care of it.

1:35:06.458 --> 1:35:08.187
- Yeah.
- Yes, girl.

1:35:08.627 --> 1:35:10.424
You don't remember me, do you?
But, see...

1:35:10.629 --> 1:35:12.528
l was just ready to duff Duke out.

1:35:12.730 --> 1:35:15.199
- Some serious shit.
- You should have did it, man.

1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:18.028
You talking all that shit, just do it.
Know what l'm saying?

1:35:18.236 --> 1:35:20.067
- You let somebody do that to you.
- l let him?

1:35:20.272 --> 1:35:21.637
- Yo, Oscar, man.
- What?

1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:23.171
Don't go nowhere. l'll be right out.

1:35:23.375 --> 1:35:25.274
- l gotta talk to you.
- l already told you...

1:35:25.476 --> 1:35:28.570
- No. You guys is kind of passing...
- l know l'm fine.

1:35:28.779 --> 1:35:31.373
But l'm not feeling myself,
l'm feeling you.

1:35:31.949 --> 1:35:35.249
Hey, l'm gonna holler at my boys
across the street for a quick minute.

1:35:35.486 --> 1:35:36.680
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1:35:36.921 --> 1:35:38.388
- All right.
- You know who we are, then?

1:35:38.622 --> 1:35:40.647
- Here they go.
- What do we have here?

1:35:40.891 --> 1:35:43.121
- The Three Stooges from Richmond.
- Punk, punk, punk.

1:35:43.327 --> 1:35:44.726
- Larry, Co and Dummy.
- Bitches.

1:35:44.929 --> 1:35:46.692
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
l mean, what the hell

1:35:46.897 --> 1:35:50.297
is the bitchman from Richmond
doing on our side of the turf?

1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:53.000
You garbage.
l can't believe y'all won.

1:35:53.203 --> 1:35:54.398
- Shut up, woman.
- Don't be--

1:35:54.605 --> 1:35:56.800
l don't understand how y'all won.

1:35:58.742 --> 1:36:00.538
- Y'all wack-star niggas.
- Y'all wacked.

1:36:00.743 --> 1:36:02.108
Wacked.

1:36:02.345 --> 1:36:04.210
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1:36:04.414 --> 1:36:07.247
- l don't wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1:36:09.152 --> 1:36:10.846
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1:36:13.590 --> 1:36:15.683
Let's do it, homey.
Let's do it, homey.

1:36:15.892 --> 1:36:17.587
- What you trying to do?
- He got a piece, man.

1:36:18.261 --> 1:36:21.162
You feel me right now, huh?
You feel me right now?

1:36:21.397 --> 1:36:24.126
- Y'all brought a gun.
- Pinole homey. Feel me?

1:36:24.333 --> 1:36:26.631
Keep it up the block, homey.
l'm right here, homey.

1:36:26.835 --> 1:36:28.996
l'm right here. Right here.

1:36:29.204 --> 1:36:31.069
lt's all good. Y'all brought a gun!

1:36:31.273 --> 1:36:32.672
Pinole!

1:36:32.908 --> 1:36:34.739
Bitch-ass...

1:36:34.943 --> 1:36:36.911
Pinole, right?

1:36:37.346 --> 1:36:40.611
- Are they serious?
- l'll knock his braids out.

1:36:41.216 --> 1:36:43.810
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.

1:36:44.586 --> 1:36:46.348
- Know what l'm saying?
- Appreciate the backup.

1:36:46.554 --> 1:36:47.953
Word.

1:36:49.290 --> 1:36:50.814
l'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1:36:51.025 --> 1:36:52.458
- All right, homey.
- Good looking.

1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:54.060
No doubt.

1:36:54.730 --> 1:36:56.322
- l'm gonna check y'all.
- You got this.

1:36:58.533 --> 1:37:00.660
This is my paper, man.
l'm not playing with you.

1:37:00.868 --> 1:37:02.768
Then why don't you stop
getting in my face.

1:37:06.874 --> 1:37:08.341
Renny!

1:37:17.318 --> 1:37:19.309
Renny!

1:37:26.793 --> 1:37:28.420
l can't believe--
He was just standing there.

1:37:28.628 --> 1:37:30.357
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.

1:37:30.564 --> 1:37:33.032
- Come on. Help me. Call 91 1 .
- Call 91 1 , man.

1:37:33.233 --> 1:37:34.894
Yo, l need a phone.
l need something...

1:37:35.101 --> 1:37:37.865
l just need you
to stay with me, okay?

1:37:41.508 --> 1:37:42.998
Hold his head up.

1:37:48.981 --> 1:37:51.415
Somebody help me!

1:38:15.274 --> 1:38:16.798
- Cruz?
- l wanna come back, coach.

1:38:17.009 --> 1:38:20.000
- What's going on?
- l wanna come back on the team.

1:38:22.113 --> 1:38:23.580
What the hell happened?

1:38:25.283 --> 1:38:27.012
They shot him.

1:38:28.286 --> 1:38:30.378
Renny. They shot Renny.

1:38:30.821 --> 1:38:32.551
l mean, we was just there.

1:38:32.757 --> 1:38:35.055
We was just there.
Everything was good.

1:38:35.259 --> 1:38:37.386
- Come inside. Come on.
- Everything was good, coach.

1:38:37.595 --> 1:38:40.428
l mean, you know...

1:38:40.632 --> 1:38:41.962
Come inside, son.

1:38:42.165 --> 1:38:44.759
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1:38:44.968 --> 1:38:48.301
l wanna come back on the team.
What do l gotta do to play?

1:38:48.505 --> 1:38:50.439
Don't worry about that, son.
Just come inside.

1:38:57.047 --> 1:38:58.947
Whatever you want me to do,

1:38:59.349 --> 1:39:00.748
l'll do it, okay?

1:39:00.951 --> 1:39:02.145
Okay. Okay.

1:39:02.352 --> 1:39:04.843
Okay. l got you.

1:39:05.054 --> 1:39:06.954
Come on. Come on,
you're back with us now.

1:39:07.156 --> 1:39:09.215
l can't believe they shot him.

1:39:09.425 --> 1:39:11.121
Just come inside now, all right?

1:39:11.328 --> 1:39:12.818
- Come on.
- l just wanna be on the team.

1:39:13.030 --> 1:39:14.019
Come on. Come on.

1:39:14.998 --> 1:39:16.897
Whatever you want me to do,

1:39:17.099 --> 1:39:19.624
l'll do it, okay?

1:39:23.239 --> 1:39:25.673
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1:39:25.908 --> 1:39:28.535
for participation
in extracurricular activities.

1:39:28.777 --> 1:39:30.803
- Yes, ma'am.
- And according to your contract,

1:39:31.047 --> 1:39:33.277
the players are agreeing
to maintain a 2.3?

1:39:33.482 --> 1:39:35.416
That, among other things.
Yes, ma'am.

1:39:35.618 --> 1:39:37.950
- Other things like...?
- Attending all classes,

1:39:38.154 --> 1:39:39.678
sitting in the front row
of those classes,

1:39:39.889 --> 1:39:41.583
and wearing a tie on game day.

1:39:42.390 --> 1:39:44.449
l see. Mr. Carter,

1:39:44.659 --> 1:39:47.423
does the lockout include
practices and games?

1:39:47.629 --> 1:39:49.722
And do you have
a set period of time?

1:39:49.932 --> 1:39:51.796
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1:39:54.235 --> 1:39:57.033
Please. Quiet, please.

1:39:57.439 --> 1:39:59.532
That includes practices and games,

1:39:59.741 --> 1:40:02.005
until we as a team
reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1:40:02.744 --> 1:40:04.335
Please, quiet.

1:40:04.945 --> 1:40:07.004
Please, quiet.

1:40:07.247 --> 1:40:09.010
Quiet.

1:40:09.551 --> 1:40:10.916
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1:40:11.119 --> 1:40:15.111
ln the interest of time, l'd like to open
this board meeting up for comments.

1:40:15.322 --> 1:40:17.813
As a teacher, l was offended
when asked by a coach

1:40:18.025 --> 1:40:20.050
to provide progress reports.

1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:23.661
Nowhere in my contract does it say
that l have to do so.

1:40:23.864 --> 1:40:25.456
lt creates more work.

1:40:25.666 --> 1:40:27.929
This lockout has brought
negative media attention

1:40:28.134 --> 1:40:30.899
that questions our abilities
as educators.

1:40:31.205 --> 1:40:34.971
End this madness. End this lockout.

1:40:37.311 --> 1:40:39.039
l'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1:40:39.245 --> 1:40:40.439
That boy lives to play ball.

1:40:40.646 --> 1:40:42.637
Comes to school every day now.

1:40:42.882 --> 1:40:45.248
You take away basketball,

1:40:45.518 --> 1:40:47.884
God knows what he'd be into.

1:40:48.688 --> 1:40:52.215
Yesterday, he canceled
the Fremont game.

1:40:52.425 --> 1:40:54.757
Now, that's the biggest game
of the year.

1:40:54.961 --> 1:40:56.895
l have scouts coming
to watch my boy play.

1:40:57.096 --> 1:41:00.190
- Me too.
- These boys are 1 6-0.

1:41:00.399 --> 1:41:03.561
This whole school, this whole
community, is behind this team.

1:41:07.239 --> 1:41:09.435
Everybody goes to every game.

1:41:09.675 --> 1:41:12.075
Basketball is the only thing
that these boys have got.

1:41:12.278 --> 1:41:15.440
Are we gonna let Carter come in here
and take that away from them?

1:41:15.647 --> 1:41:18.241
- No!
- l don't think so.

1:41:18.450 --> 1:41:19.644
Not gonna happen.

1:41:26.957 --> 1:41:29.756
- l'd like to make a motion.
- Yes, Mr. Walters?

1:41:30.128 --> 1:41:34.428
l move that we remove Mr. Carter
as head basketball coach.

1:41:38.068 --> 1:41:40.730
Order, please. Order.

1:41:40.971 --> 1:41:42.529
This board does not have
the authority

1:41:42.773 --> 1:41:44.798
to terminate employment
of a staff position.

1:41:45.042 --> 1:41:49.376
Then l move we end the lockout
and let the kids play.

1:41:50.614 --> 1:41:52.206
l second the motion.

1:41:52.416 --> 1:41:53.781
- Okay.
- lf l may?

1:41:53.984 --> 1:41:55.315
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1:41:55.519 --> 1:41:57.544
You really need to consider
the message

1:41:57.755 --> 1:41:59.382
that you're sending these boys.

1:41:59.722 --> 1:42:03.783
lt's the same message that we
as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1:42:03.993 --> 1:42:06.553
which is that they are above the law.

1:42:06.996 --> 1:42:10.364
Now, l'm trying to teach these boys
the discipline that will inform their lives

1:42:10.568 --> 1:42:12.228
and give them choices.

1:42:12.569 --> 1:42:16.869
lf you endorse the fact
that 1 5-, 1 6- and 1 7-year-olds

1:42:17.106 --> 1:42:20.598
don't have to honor the simple rules
of a basketball contract,

1:42:20.844 --> 1:42:23.937
how long do you think it'll be before
they're out there breaking laws?

1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:28.150
Now, l played basketball
at Richmond 30 years ago.

1:42:28.384 --> 1:42:30.682
lt was the same thing then.

1:42:30.887 --> 1:42:33.253
Some of my teammates
ended up in prison.

1:42:33.456 --> 1:42:35.719
Some of them ended up dead.

1:42:35.924 --> 1:42:38.859
l took this job because
l wanted to effect change

1:42:39.061 --> 1:42:40.528
in a special group of young men,

1:42:40.729 --> 1:42:44.665
and this is the only way
l know how to do that.

1:42:46.068 --> 1:42:48.127
lf you vote to end the lockout,

1:42:48.370 --> 1:42:51.396
you won't have to terminate me.
l'll quit.

1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.039
Good.

1:42:58.613 --> 1:43:00.877
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1:43:02.984 --> 1:43:05.680
The board now recognizes
five voting members.

1:43:05.887 --> 1:43:09.721
ln this instance, we will be accepting
the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1:43:10.224 --> 1:43:13.887
Now, l put to those members
the vote on whether or not

1:43:14.095 --> 1:43:15.892
to end the lockout.

1:43:16.097 --> 1:43:18.190
All those in favor
of ending the lockout

1:43:18.399 --> 1:43:21.492
will raise their right hand
when called upon.

1:43:21.735 --> 1:43:26.069
l will vote first
by not raising my hand.

1:43:26.741 --> 1:43:29.335
Principal Garrison?

1:43:33.146 --> 1:43:35.740
Valerie Walker.

1:43:37.083 --> 1:43:38.744
Benson Chiu.

1:43:41.121 --> 1:43:42.884
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1:43:45.124 --> 1:43:47.093
And Ms. Nyugen.

1:43:47.294 --> 1:43:49.592
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1:44:04.910 --> 1:44:07.607
The lockout ends with a vote
of 4 to 2.

1:44:07.813 --> 1:44:11.078
lf there's no other business,
this board meeting is adjourned.

1:44:11.784 --> 1:44:13.251
Thank you all for coming.

1:44:30.502 --> 1:44:32.560
Mr. Carter.

1:44:32.804 --> 1:44:35.272
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1:44:37.375 --> 1:44:39.639
Look, l know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

1:44:39.844 --> 1:44:42.607
but you've done such a great job with
these boys, it seems wrong to just--

1:44:42.813 --> 1:44:46.682
Look. No offense, ma'am,
but all the work l did with those boys

1:44:46.884 --> 1:44:48.579
was negated when they ended
the lockout.

1:44:49.053 --> 1:44:50.452
l don't think that's true, l--

1:44:50.655 --> 1:44:52.589
The board sent the message
loud and clear.

1:44:52.790 --> 1:44:54.552
Winning basketball games
is more important

1:44:54.758 --> 1:44:57.283
than graduating from high school
and going to college.

1:44:57.494 --> 1:45:01.157
l'm sorry, l just can't support
that message.

1:45:48.811 --> 1:45:54.271
Sir, they can cut the chain off the
door, but they can't make us play.

1:45:56.484 --> 1:46:00.443
We've decided we're gonna finish
what you started, sir.

1:46:01.356 --> 1:46:03.153
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1:46:03.491 --> 1:46:05.015
We got shit to do, sir.

1:46:18.739 --> 1:46:21.173
Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

1:46:21.375 --> 1:46:24.368
Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure.

1:46:25.313 --> 1:46:28.713
lt is our light, not our darkness
that most frightens us.

1:46:29.049 --> 1:46:30.983
Your playing small
does not serve the world.

1:46:31.185 --> 1:46:32.812
There is nothing enlightened
about shrinking

1:46:33.020 --> 1:46:35.750
so that other people
won't feel insecure around you.

1:46:36.723 --> 1:46:39.748
We were all meant to shine,
as children do.

1:46:39.992 --> 1:46:42.962
lt's not just in some of us,
it's in everyone.

1:46:43.397 --> 1:46:45.388
And as we let our own light shine,

1:46:45.632 --> 1:46:48.430
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

1:46:48.936 --> 1:46:51.904
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

1:46:52.338 --> 1:46:54.966
our presence automatically
liberates others.

1:47:01.314 --> 1:47:03.714
Sir, l just wanna say thank you.

1:47:06.085 --> 1:47:07.882
You saved my life.

1:47:16.795 --> 1:47:19.195
Thank you, sirs.

1:47:21.733 --> 1:47:23.964
All of you.

1:48:06.243 --> 1:48:09.735
Academic-progress reports,
young men.

1:48:09.947 --> 1:48:12.744
These things are...

1:48:13.183 --> 1:48:15.378
...unbelievable.

1:48:15.885 --> 1:48:18.649
l know you've been trying.

1:48:20.790 --> 1:48:24.248
l guess there's only one way
to say this.

1:48:25.695 --> 1:48:27.925
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal.
Let's play ball.

1:48:33.503 --> 1:48:35.732
Rich what? Richmond!

1:48:35.938 --> 1:48:38.338
Rich what? Richmond!

1:48:38.540 --> 1:48:40.531
Rich what? Richmond!

1:49:07.636 --> 1:49:09.331
Hustle back. Get back, get back.

1:49:11.005 --> 1:49:12.870
Set it, Worm. Set it.

1:49:13.407 --> 1:49:15.307
Watch baseline.

1:49:15.509 --> 1:49:17.773
- Take it.
- Take it, come on.

1:49:20.415 --> 1:49:22.848
- Yes!
- Find a man. Find a man.

1:49:26.254 --> 1:49:28.154
Swing it, swing it.

1:49:28.789 --> 1:49:30.780
Go, go, go.

1:49:33.394 --> 1:49:35.384
Go, go.

1:49:35.629 --> 1:49:37.062
Come on!

1:49:47.107 --> 1:49:48.369
Go Richmond!

1:49:48.842 --> 1:49:50.742
Hold the ball, hold the ball!

1:49:53.546 --> 1:49:57.072
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1:49:57.283 --> 1:50:01.380
five, four, three, two, one,

1:50:01.621 --> 1:50:02.883
see you!

1:50:10.462 --> 1:50:12.657
- Great game, coach.
- Good game.

1:50:16.635 --> 1:50:19.935
Richmond returns from their lockout
and keeps their streak alive

1:50:20.139 --> 1:50:21.436
at 1 7 games.

1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:25.906
A team that won only four games
last year is now a Cinderella team

1:50:26.111 --> 1:50:28.306
that has to be thinking
that there's a chance

1:50:28.514 --> 1:50:31.074
of getting the phone call
to come to the dance.

1:50:31.283 --> 1:50:33.546
ls Richmond headed
for the state tournament?

1:50:46.097 --> 1:50:48.725
So, what else y'all gonna do
at the park when you go?

1:50:48.933 --> 1:50:50.924
- Seesaw.
- Seesaw?

1:50:51.135 --> 1:50:52.727
- You're gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.

1:50:52.937 --> 1:50:55.564
- Who's gonna push you?
- My mommy's gonna push me.

1:50:55.772 --> 1:50:57.865
Yeah?

1:50:58.075 --> 1:51:00.340
That's good.
l wish l could go with you.

1:51:00.545 --> 1:51:03.446
- Come on, baby.
- But l'll see you later, okay?

1:51:03.648 --> 1:51:05.775
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:51:11.455 --> 1:51:12.615
How you been?

1:51:14.758 --> 1:51:16.487
Good.

1:51:17.094 --> 1:51:19.221
You look good.

1:51:19.429 --> 1:51:22.398
Thank you. So do you.

1:51:22.599 --> 1:51:24.624
Considering.

1:51:29.106 --> 1:51:33.041
You know, everything's been crazy,
with the lockout.

1:51:33.242 --> 1:51:34.709
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1:51:35.711 --> 1:51:37.474
For sure.

1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:39.581
Can we sit down somewhere?

1:51:59.635 --> 1:52:03.196
l've been trying to get my head
straight about things.

1:52:03.406 --> 1:52:05.999
A lot of things. Especially us.

1:52:06.207 --> 1:52:08.869
- Kenny, l--
- Kyra, just listen.

1:52:09.778 --> 1:52:11.837
Please.

1:52:13.314 --> 1:52:18.445
For a long time, it's just been
my moms, my boys and you.

1:52:18.686 --> 1:52:20.210
And that's what l counted on.

1:52:20.622 --> 1:52:24.183
l'm trying to count on myself now,
and l'm all right and shit,

1:52:24.392 --> 1:52:28.760
it's just, without you,
nothing good feels as good.

1:52:29.196 --> 1:52:33.792
lt's like l'm missing
some happy part of me.

1:52:45.179 --> 1:52:47.010
l got you something.

1:52:49.016 --> 1:52:50.745
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1:52:52.885 --> 1:52:55.080
Shut up.

1:52:58.859 --> 1:53:00.986
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1:53:01.195 --> 1:53:05.893
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1:53:06.098 --> 1:53:08.293
Oh, my gosh.

1:53:08.501 --> 1:53:10.264
l know you gonna kill it up there.

1:53:10.470 --> 1:53:12.938
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1:53:13.139 --> 1:53:15.538
l told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.

1:53:28.019 --> 1:53:29.611
Kenyon...

1:53:30.555 --> 1:53:32.614
...there is no more baby.

1:53:36.429 --> 1:53:39.625
l decided not to go through with it.

1:53:40.632 --> 1:53:42.759
Kyra.

1:53:43.435 --> 1:53:46.131
l had a choice to make,

1:53:46.338 --> 1:53:48.772
so l made it.

1:53:48.974 --> 1:53:51.407
For me, Kenny.

1:53:53.911 --> 1:53:57.279
Well, when...?

1:53:57.482 --> 1:54:00.918
Why didn't you tell me?
l would have gone with you.

1:54:05.589 --> 1:54:07.454
l'm so sorry.

1:54:08.659 --> 1:54:11.787
Kyra, l'm so sorry you had to
go through that by yourself.

1:54:14.163 --> 1:54:16.962
My mom went with me.

1:54:18.702 --> 1:54:20.329
But l think that...

1:54:20.538 --> 1:54:26.237
l think you should go to school
and play ball and do your thing.

1:54:26.442 --> 1:54:28.034
You know?

1:54:28.278 --> 1:54:31.714
l want that for you. And that's real.

1:54:32.582 --> 1:54:34.880
l think you should be all you can.

1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:39.350
l want you to come with me.

1:54:42.158 --> 1:54:44.023
Kyra, l love you.

1:54:44.627 --> 1:54:46.356
l want you to come with me.

1:54:47.530 --> 1:54:49.759
- You serious?
- l'm serious.

1:54:50.566 --> 1:54:52.830
- Oh, my God.
- l love you.

1:54:53.035 --> 1:54:55.266
l love you too.

1:55:03.211 --> 1:55:04.405
Ken Carter.

1:55:06.548 --> 1:55:08.812
l understand, sir.

1:55:09.651 --> 1:55:11.675
All right. Thank you, sir.

1:55:20.462 --> 1:55:21.986
We're in.

1:55:23.731 --> 1:55:25.323
That's what l'm talking about.

1:55:31.906 --> 1:55:34.841
Guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.

1:55:35.076 --> 1:55:37.340
lt's not gonna be easy.
lt's gonna be a long road.

1:55:38.079 --> 1:55:41.105
- We're a really low seed.
- Who did we get, coach?

1:55:42.984 --> 1:55:44.576
St. Francis.

1:55:44.785 --> 1:55:46.274
St. Francis?

1:55:46.486 --> 1:55:49.649
Coach, they ranked number one
in the state.

1:55:50.924 --> 1:55:53.951
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry
about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.

1:55:54.395 --> 1:55:57.795
We got this. That's all right, baby.
One game at a time. We got this.

1:55:57.998 --> 1:55:59.829
- All right, guys.
- lt's on.

1:56:08.875 --> 1:56:12.002
- Bring your A game, young man.
- Yes, sir.

1:56:43.509 --> 1:56:47.467
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first round of the ClF playoffs.

1:56:47.712 --> 1:56:51.148
St. Francis is one of the best
high school teams in the nation,

1:56:51.349 --> 1:56:53.215
with Ty Crane
believed to be a shoo-in

1:56:53.419 --> 1:56:56.114
for the top NBA draft pick next year.

1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:58.811
On the other side of the court
is Richmond,

1:56:59.023 --> 1:57:01.253
a team that's had
a media-worthy season as well.

1:57:01.693 --> 1:57:04.594
Richmond High has never played
in a state tournament.

1:57:04.796 --> 1:57:08.128
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1:57:13.204 --> 1:57:15.263
- Settle down, settle down.
- 1 -4!

1:57:18.810 --> 1:57:20.276
Ball, ball.

1:57:20.510 --> 1:57:22.068
Move, move.

1:57:26.750 --> 1:57:28.445
Good shot, baby.

1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:32.480
- Get back, get back.
- Run motion. Run motion.

1:57:32.689 --> 1:57:34.281
Motion 44.

1:57:38.562 --> 1:57:40.052
Right here, right here. Swing it.

1:57:42.798 --> 1:57:44.561
Force him left. Force him left.

1:57:50.372 --> 1:57:53.831
You gotta force him left.
The baseline's another defender.

1:57:56.545 --> 1:57:58.274
D up!

1:58:03.219 --> 1:58:05.187
Better get somebody else to hold me.
l'm dropping 50.

1:58:07.555 --> 1:58:08.886
Set up!

1:58:13.195 --> 1:58:15.857
Come on. Get on him, get on him.

1:58:16.632 --> 1:58:19.122
Get over here and help.
He shouldn't be scoring.

1:58:19.334 --> 1:58:20.995
Get back, get back. Bring it in.

1:58:22.737 --> 1:58:24.932
Get back, get back.
Find your man, find your man.

1:58:25.173 --> 1:58:27.164
Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1:58:27.408 --> 1:58:30.843
Watch the trap. Motion. Motion.
That's the one.

1:58:32.547 --> 1:58:34.845
That's it. Yes! Yes!

1:58:35.049 --> 1:58:38.610
S-C-O-R-E! Score! Score!

1:58:41.288 --> 1:58:43.085
Ball, ball. Ball, man!

1:58:49.930 --> 1:58:52.694
Lyle, stop the ball.
Less talk out there.

1:59:02.910 --> 1:59:07.039
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, Richmond!

1:59:07.246 --> 1:59:09.908
You gotta help Junior
on the weak-side pick.

1:59:14.521 --> 1:59:18.752
- Delilah! Delilah!
- Defense! Defense!

1:59:18.958 --> 1:59:21.188
- Defense! Defense!
- Delilah! Delilah!

1:59:21.394 --> 1:59:22.861
Delilah! Delilah!

1:59:24.530 --> 1:59:27.123
- Get there, get there.
- Trap, trap, trap. Left side, left side.

1:59:39.711 --> 1:59:42.839
- Use the pick, use the pick.
- l got it.

1:59:45.483 --> 1:59:48.680
- Yeah! That's what l'm talking about.
- Foul, number three.

1:59:48.887 --> 1:59:49.946
- Hold up.
- Number three.

1:59:50.156 --> 1:59:52.919
- Mustangs, bring it in. Bring it in.
- Count the basket.

1:59:53.124 --> 1:59:55.456
- Damn.
- Timeout, sir. Time.

1:59:55.660 --> 1:59:58.356
Come here, come here. Damn it.

2:00:00.298 --> 2:00:02.663
Come on, guys,
keep up the defense!

2:00:02.900 --> 2:00:05.368
Come on, what you gonna do?

2:00:05.803 --> 2:00:08.499
We still in this game.
Come on, fellas.

2:00:09.306 --> 2:00:12.640
Gentlemen, you told me
you deserved to be here.

2:00:12.844 --> 2:00:14.401
Well, you're not playing like it.

2:00:14.612 --> 2:00:17.479
All season long,
we played our game.

2:00:17.681 --> 2:00:20.081
Right now, you're playing theirs.

2:00:20.284 --> 2:00:24.186
When we step on the floor,
every second that clock is ticking,

2:00:24.388 --> 2:00:26.412
we are pedal to the metal.

2:00:26.623 --> 2:00:29.149
We run the ball.
We pressure the ball.

2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:34.662
And most importantly,
we control the tempo of the game!

2:00:34.899 --> 2:00:39.494
We make them play
Richmond Oiler ball.

2:00:39.736 --> 2:00:41.704
Worm, you can take this kid.

2:00:41.938 --> 2:00:43.428
Force him left,
and when he crosses over,

2:00:43.673 --> 2:00:46.699
you jump him.
Damien, push the tempo.

2:00:46.910 --> 2:00:49.242
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

2:00:49.445 --> 2:00:52.972
Cruz, when you're in the game in
transition, take that jumper you love.

2:00:53.416 --> 2:00:55.884
Junior, just keep doing
what you're doing.

2:00:56.085 --> 2:00:57.950
Hold on to that monster.

2:00:58.154 --> 2:01:01.452
You do those things, gentlemen,
and l guarantee you,

2:01:01.657 --> 2:01:05.559
at the end of the game,
we will be there.

2:01:08.063 --> 2:01:10.191
All right, hands in.

2:01:10.433 --> 2:01:12.992
- Game time.
- All right, take control of this game.

2:01:13.235 --> 2:01:14.395
Who's gonna win this game?

2:01:14.636 --> 2:01:18.163
One, two, three, Richmond!
Let's go. Let's do this.

2:01:22.110 --> 2:01:24.600
One, two, three, Mustangs!

2:01:32.321 --> 2:01:34.755
- Get up, get up.
- Go, go, go.

2:01:42.830 --> 2:01:43.922
Yes.

2:01:47.701 --> 2:01:50.068
- Reach-in foul.
- That's the only damn one.

2:01:50.271 --> 2:01:53.763
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.

2:01:53.975 --> 2:01:56.443
Cruz. ln for Kenyon.

2:01:59.279 --> 2:02:02.680
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.
- Run it, run it, run it.

2:02:16.696 --> 2:02:18.823
Get back, get back!
Everybody get back.

2:02:19.399 --> 2:02:21.128
Yeah! Come on!

2:02:41.286 --> 2:02:43.015
Get back, get back, get back.

2:02:52.498 --> 2:02:54.056
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.

2:02:54.299 --> 2:02:56.324
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?

2:03:04.842 --> 2:03:07.607
Take care of the ball, man.
l'm gonna catch my breath.

2:03:16.854 --> 2:03:18.116
Come on. Get back, get back.

2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:24.821
Swing it right here. l got it.

2:03:29.267 --> 2:03:30.666
Charge.

2:03:32.702 --> 2:03:35.034
- Go get them, boys.
- Yeah, baby.

2:03:35.238 --> 2:03:38.139
Charge, number 30. Red ball.

2:03:38.341 --> 2:03:40.571
Come on, ref,
you wasn't even there.

2:03:46.083 --> 2:03:49.246
- Red ball, red ball. Red, red, red.
- Yes. Yes.

2:03:49.453 --> 2:03:50.750
- Richmond's ball.
- What?

2:03:50.954 --> 2:03:53.320
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

2:04:00.796 --> 2:04:02.263
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!

2:04:03.165 --> 2:04:05.634
- l know that's a foul.
- lt's all ball.

2:04:05.836 --> 2:04:08.395
- What are you talking about?
- What's up, man?

2:04:11.707 --> 2:04:13.675
Knock his bitch ass out.

2:04:13.876 --> 2:04:15.810
Calm down, man.
We're still in the game.

2:04:16.245 --> 2:04:17.371
Come on.

2:04:18.113 --> 2:04:19.603
- Ease back.
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

2:04:22.650 --> 2:04:24.777
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.

2:04:26.188 --> 2:04:28.713
Let's go, let's go.

2:04:28.958 --> 2:04:32.051
All right, baby, it's all us now.
lt's all us. Let's go.

2:04:41.269 --> 2:04:44.237
They're standing on the edge of a cliff.
All we gotta do is push them off.

2:04:44.705 --> 2:04:45.730
We're gonna run Candy.

2:04:45.940 --> 2:04:47.931
Worm, you gotta sell them
the pass to Damien.

2:04:48.143 --> 2:04:50.941
Junior, we come to you
on the weak-side seal.

2:04:51.146 --> 2:04:53.272
But, gentlemen,
just because you deserve this

2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:55.072
doesn't mean they're gonna
give it to you.

2:04:55.282 --> 2:04:59.150
Sometimes you gotta take
what's yours. You ready to do this?

2:04:59.353 --> 2:05:00.877
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

2:05:01.121 --> 2:05:03.453
- All right, hands in.
- Come on, take this.

2:05:03.690 --> 2:05:05.783
Richmond on three.
One, two, three, Richmond!

2:05:13.233 --> 2:05:15.793
- Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.
- l got you. 1 -4, 1 -4!

2:05:16.903 --> 2:05:19.565
- All right.
- Defense! Mustangs!

2:05:19.772 --> 2:05:21.603
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2:05:24.444 --> 2:05:26.571
Candy! Candy!

2:05:30.316 --> 2:05:32.307
Ball, Damien.

2:05:37.056 --> 2:05:39.785
- Move, move.
- Help, help.

2:05:56.208 --> 2:05:58.267
Get back, get back, get back!

2:06:02.681 --> 2:06:04.114
Junior, get back!

2:06:15.025 --> 2:06:16.890
Hands up!

2:06:31.008 --> 2:06:33.738
Yeah, that's what l'm
talking about, baby. Yeah!

2:07:25.727 --> 2:07:28.855
Mustangs! Mustangs!

2:07:30.132 --> 2:07:33.568
Hold on, hold on. Let me down,
let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

2:07:36.270 --> 2:07:39.262
You're real, man.
l mean that. All right?

2:07:40.074 --> 2:07:43.044
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

2:07:55.790 --> 2:07:58.554
Well, not quite
your storybook ending, huh?

2:07:58.759 --> 2:08:01.124
Not for us, anyway.

2:08:02.930 --> 2:08:06.525
But you men played like champions.

2:08:06.734 --> 2:08:08.395
You never gave up.

2:08:09.203 --> 2:08:13.298
And champions
hold their heads high.

2:08:13.506 --> 2:08:16.942
What you achieved goes way beyond
the win-loss column

2:08:17.143 --> 2:08:18.940
or what's gonna be written
on the front page

2:08:19.145 --> 2:08:21.671
of the sports section tomorrow.

2:08:21.916 --> 2:08:23.678
You've achieved something
that some people

2:08:23.917 --> 2:08:27.478
spend their whole lives trying to find.

2:08:27.721 --> 2:08:33.682
What you achieved
is that ever-elusive victory within.

2:08:34.993 --> 2:08:36.722
And, gentlemen...

2:08:37.596 --> 2:08:41.033
...l am so proud of you.

2:08:44.304 --> 2:08:48.171
Four months ago, when l took
the job at Richmond, l had a plan.

2:08:48.841 --> 2:08:51.309
That plan failed.

2:08:51.510 --> 2:08:56.311
l came to coach basketball players,
and you became students.

2:08:57.749 --> 2:09:00.081
l came to teach boys...

2:09:00.619 --> 2:09:02.678
...and you became men.

2:09:03.255 --> 2:09:05.052
And for that, l thank you.

2:09:08.961 --> 2:09:11.929
lf someone walked in this door
right now

2:09:12.130 --> 2:09:17.727
and offered me the coaching job
at any school in the state of California,

2:09:17.935 --> 2:09:20.700
you know which team l'd choose?

2:09:20.905 --> 2:09:22.998
St. Francis?

2:09:23.608 --> 2:09:25.838
l'm just saying, man.

2:09:26.811 --> 2:09:28.870
Kenyon?

2:09:32.716 --> 2:09:35.048
- Richmond?
- Rich what?

2:09:36.219 --> 2:09:38.187
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

2:09:38.388 --> 2:09:39.548
Richmond.

2:09:39.756 --> 2:09:42.351
- Rich what?
- Richmond.

2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:44.720
- Where we from?
- Richmond!

2:09:44.928 --> 2:09:47.362
- What's my hometown?
- Richmond!

2:09:47.564 --> 2:09:49.589
- What do we love?
- Richmond!

2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:52.064
- Rich what?
- Richmond!

2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.999
