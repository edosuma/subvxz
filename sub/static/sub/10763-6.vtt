WEBVTT

00:09.743 --> 00:11.734
 Good morning  ..

00:12.078 --> 00:13.680
 Good morning

00:13.680 --> 00:16.181
 I'd like a bagel, too .

00:16.181 --> 00:17.751
 And schmear it with cream cheese

00:17.751 --> 00:18.752
Excuse me.

00:18.752 --> 00:19.753
 Thank you.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.254
Excuse me!

00:21.254 --> 00:22.756
Did it occur to you

00:22.756 --> 00:24.257
that some of us might
still be trying to sleep?

00:24.257 --> 00:25.246
Oh, lighten up, Fras.

00:25.759 --> 00:26.760
Ronee was just showing me

00:26.760 --> 00:27.761
how she can change the lyrics

00:27.761 --> 00:28.762
to any song to suit the occasion.

00:28.762 --> 00:29.763
Yes, very impressive.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.131
Does she take requests?

00:31.131 --> 00:31.529
Sure.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.234
Stop it.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.531
You know what you need, Grumpy?

00:36.236 --> 00:37.225
A nice hot breakfast.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.239
Marty, why don't you get
Grump here some breakfast?

00:39.239 --> 00:40.540
I don't want any breakfast.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.542
And please stop calling me that.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.545
?? Got me some ham and
some cake on the griddle??

00:45.545 --> 00:49.249
?? whoo! Good God, he's a grumpy boy.??

00:49.249 --> 00:50.650
(laughing)

00:50.650 --> 00:52.252
You see what she just did?

00:52.252 --> 00:54.482
Yes, it's mind-boggling.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.789
Listen, Dad, do you mind

00:55.789 --> 00:57.724
giving me a ride to work today?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.225
My car is in the shop.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.226
Again?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.228
Yes, my seat warmer's stuck on high.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.732
So I tried to offset it by
blasting the air conditioner,

01:05.732 --> 01:09.224
which resulted in sort of
a fog bank on my dashboard.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.438
I can give you a ride, Fras.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.406
It's just an old Caddy,

01:13.406 --> 01:16.409
so there's nothing fancy like
butt warmers or seat belts.

01:16.409 --> 01:21.181
Fine. Let me just make
sure my will is in order,

01:21.181 --> 01:23.274
and I'll be back in a minute.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.151
well, I'm going to take a shower.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.287
Don't use all the hot water.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.589
I know. Gotta leave
enough for milady's tub.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.591
That's okay. I can take a shower, too.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.582
I wasn't talking about you.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.597
(phone rings)

01:37.597 --> 01:40.333
Hello?

01:40.333 --> 01:42.435
Oh, Richard, hi.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.504
Listen, this really isn't a good time.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.607
I was just heading into a yoga class.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.477
Yeah. No. I would love to have dinner.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.513
That sounds fun.

01:53.513 --> 01:56.311
Okay, I'll see you then, sweetie.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.309
You know, I got two steps in my room

02:00.820 --> 02:01.821
and realized I forgot my...

02:01.821 --> 02:03.323
Ah, there it is.

02:03.323 --> 02:06.326
(to the tune of "There
She Is, Miss America ")

02:06.326 --> 02:07.327
?? There it is??

02:07.327 --> 02:10.193
?? Frasier's coffee cup...??

02:10.497 --> 02:13.261
You are a national treasure.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.341
Niles, thank God you're here.

02:21.341 --> 02:22.342
Listen, there's something
I need to discuss.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.843
wait, wait, wait.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.345
I'm in the middle of composing a plea

02:25.345 --> 02:26.846
to Alfred Antin in
the meter of Dr. Seuss.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.348
who?

02:28.348 --> 02:30.250
Theodor Geisel, the children's author.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.718
You know, "I do not
like green eggs and ham,

02:31.718 --> 02:33.186
I do not like them, Sam I Am. "

02:33.186 --> 02:35.188
Yes, I know who Dr. Seuss is, you ninny.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.177
who's the other guy?

02:36.689 --> 02:37.690
Oh, oh. Alfred Antin.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.180
He's Seattle's premier scenic painter

02:39.692 --> 02:40.693
specializing in children's rooms.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.195
His billowing clouds can be seen

02:42.195 --> 02:44.197
scudding across the ceilings

02:44.197 --> 02:45.698
of the finest nurseries in town,

02:45.698 --> 02:47.200
but he's booked solid,

02:47.200 --> 02:48.701
.. so I thought if I wrote this.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.538
Oh, you've lost interest , haven't you?

02:51.538 --> 02:54.240
I was feigning interest to begin with.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.543
Niles, I need your advice on something.

02:56.543 --> 03:01.548
This morning I heard Ronee on the phone

03:01.548 --> 03:03.914
make a date with another man.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.418
Are you sure?

03:05.418 --> 03:06.920
well, I'm positive

03:06.920 --> 03:08.922
she was talking to a man,
yes, and in honeyed tones.

03:08.922 --> 03:09.411
Mm.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.658
Here's my predicament.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.626
I don't want to meddle,

03:13.626 --> 03:16.329
but I also don't want
to see Dad get hurt.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.320
So how do you suggest we tell him?

03:22.268 --> 03:24.404
"we"? Yes, "we. "

03:24.404 --> 03:26.806
Don't drag me into this. I
don't know a thing about it.

03:26.806 --> 03:27.795
You know as much as I
do. I just briefed you.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.232
I didn't want to be briefed.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.710
Then you should have said something.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.212
Now you're in as deep as I am.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.713
You can't unscramble an egg, Niles.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.215
what are you talking about?!

03:35.215 --> 03:38.218
Oh, boys, boys, boys.
I'm glad I caught you.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.708
Did you see this?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.523
"Doo-wop-alooza
"?

03:43.523 --> 03:45.225
Yeah, one night only.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.527
All the greats of doo-wop:
The Coasters, The platters,

03:47.527 --> 03:49.222
and that guy from The Teenagers

03:49.529 --> 03:51.231
is back from his hip replacement.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.232
wow.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.234
Yes.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.236
Oh, I know you guys aren't
interested in modern music,

03:56.236 --> 03:58.004
but Ronee would really love it.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.506
I was hoping maybe you
could use your connections

04:00.506 --> 04:01.941
to maybe score us a couple of seats.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.431
I'm afraid I'm not

04:03.943 --> 04:05.433
that well-connected to
the doo-wop world, Dad.

04:05.945 --> 04:08.948
If there's ever a Mahler
- palooza, I'm your man.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.451
Dad, I'll ask around.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.454
win I'm off to try to

04:14.454 --> 04:17.957
the heart and mind of A. Antin.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.959
I'll go and meet him with my Daphne

04:19.959 --> 04:22.450
and hope that things
don't go ker-phaphne.

04:25.465 --> 04:29.969
Sorry again about this morning
me and Ronee waking you up.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.960
we were just having a little fun.

04:32.472 --> 04:33.973
It's all right. It's great t
have a fling once in a while.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.964
Hey, let me tell you something:

04:36.476 --> 04:38.778
you don't go to
Doo-wop-alooza with a fling.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.268
I see.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.284
You got something you want to say, son?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.273
No.

04:45.785 --> 04:46.286
Fine.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.787
well, all right,

04:47.787 --> 04:50.790
if you insist on dragging it out of me.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.292
Something happened this morning, Dad.

04:52.292 --> 04:52.792
what?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.727
well, I was

04:54.727 --> 04:57.430
walking down the hall
to retrieve my coffee

04:57.430 --> 04:58.727
and Ronee was on the phone,

04:59.432 --> 05:01.734
and I didn't want to
interrupt so I waited.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.437
And I heard her make a...

05:04.437 --> 05:06.428
a date with another man.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.011
So you eavesdropped, huh?

05:12.011 --> 05:13.613
No.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.315
A person's having a
private conversation,

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
you stop and listen--
that's eavesdropping.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.317
Dad, it was completely by accident.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.319
I understand why you'd be upset,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
but please don't shoot the messenger.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.310
well, the messenger's got it coming

05:22.622 --> 05:25.318
if he's a dirty little eavesdropper.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.627
You walk into a private conversation,

05:27.627 --> 05:30.330
you make your presence
known by some subtle way.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.631
You can clear your
throat. (clears throat)

05:31.631 --> 05:32.632
You can make a noise.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.634
Dad, please!

05:34.634 --> 05:36.336
You know, just because people call in

05:36.336 --> 05:38.327
for your precious pearls
of wisdom on the radio,

05:38.638 --> 05:39.627
doesn't give you a free pass

05:40.340 --> 05:41.341
to get into everybody's business.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.643
Now I know why you 're always
saying, "I'm listening. "

05:43.643 --> 05:45.338
Because you always are.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.342
(laughing)

05:50.650 --> 05:53.353
Oh, well, I'm glad the two
of you found that so amusing,

05:53.353 --> 05:54.654
but as you've just heard,

05:54.654 --> 05:56.645
 it is rude to listen in
on other people's conversations.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.166
(doorbell rings)

06:16.576 --> 06:18.077
Oh, Niles, come on i n. Hey, Frasier.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.078
Hi. I'm just here to drop off

06:19.078 --> 06:20.580
these Doo-wop-alooza
tickets for Dad.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.082
Oh, well, that's good
luck. How did you manage it?

06:23.082 --> 06:24.584
well, actually,

06:24.584 --> 06:26.085
Alfred Antin and his
wife are big doo-wop fans,

06:26.085 --> 06:27.587
and the, uh, the couple

06:27.587 --> 06:29.077
that was going with them canceled,

06:29.589 --> 06:30.590
so-so they let...

06:30.590 --> 06:32.581
they let me have the tickets.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.596
what are we looking for?

06:36.596 --> 06:38.097
well, my money clip. Have you seen it?

06:38.097 --> 06:40.088
Rarely.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.171
I've misplaced it,

06:45.171 --> 06:46.672
and it's-it's distracting me no end.

06:46.672 --> 06:47.639
well, anyway, Dad was thrilled

06:48.174 --> 06:49.642
when I told him I found the tickets.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.177
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.

06:51.177 --> 06:52.645
He was just a bit vexed

06:52.645 --> 06:53.634
when he left me earlier this morning.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.148
Over what?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.083
Frasier,

06:57.083 --> 06:58.584
you told him about Ronee's date.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.916
As we agreed.

07:01.487 --> 07:01.816
"we"?

07:02.488 --> 07:03.489
Yes, "we. "

07:03.489 --> 07:04.786
" . There's no "we. "
There's never been a "we

07:05.158 --> 07:06.192
Oh, give it up, Niles.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.694
There's blood on both our hands.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.685
Oh, gosh, I better go eat something.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.199
I've got my reading in 20 minutes.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.700
Reading? Yes.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.702
Yes. I'm, uh, reciting "Annabelle Lee"

07:16.702 --> 07:18.192
for the poe Society this evening.

07:18.704 --> 07:21.207
I-I don't mind telling you
, I'm just a bit nervous.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.174
Oh, don't worry.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.644
po' folk don't'spect much.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.635
(laughing)

07:27.146 --> 07:29.148
I had to say that.

07:29.148 --> 07:30.650
well, I'm off.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.641
Yes.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.144
(door opening)

07:36.656 --> 07:38.146
(door closing)

07:44.163 --> 07:46.028
It's this amazing doo-wop show.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.901
All the greats, one
night only, this Sunday.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.892
RONEE: Sunday? I...

07:53.606 --> 07:55.597
God, I'm sorry. I-I... I made plans.

07:55.775 --> 07:56.843
Oh, plans, huh?

07:56.843 --> 07:59.846
Uh... what kind of plans?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.548
Look, Marty, I like you
too much to lie to you. I...

08:02.548 --> 08:03.850
I have a date.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.218
Oh, oh.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.553
well, that's no problem. Yeah.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.555
Uh, you want a drink?

08:09.555 --> 08:12.683
Oh, no, I better not.
I'm working. Just a beer.

08:17.697 --> 08:18.698
You're not upset, are you?

08:18.698 --> 08:20.700
I mean, you know, we never really talked

08:20.700 --> 08:22.702
about not seeing other people.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.003
Oh, no, that's fine. No, no.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.705
I'm seeing other people, too.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.707
Maybe I'll ask, uh...

08:27.707 --> 08:28.708
Sheila.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.710
Yeah. She'll be all over this one.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.945
(Ronee laughs)

08:32.945 --> 08:35.047
So, uh...

08:35.047 --> 08:37.650
how about another night?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.549
Yeah, sure. How's... what about Tuesday?

08:39.784 --> 08:40.753
Great. Great.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.255
Great. Great.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.624
RONEE: wow, I had no
idea it was this late.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.125
So I'll call you about Tuesday.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.114
Great.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.027
(sighs)

08:56.736 --> 08:58.294
Frasier, what are you doing?

09:04.744 --> 09:05.745
I didn't know you two were home.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.246
Uh...

09:07.246 --> 09:09.081
I was just, uh, cleaning the oven.

09:09.081 --> 09:12.685
I must have dozed off.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.086
Cool.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.589
well, got to run. Good night, you two.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.578
Yeah. See ya.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.593
You have a disease!

09:20.593 --> 09:22.083
please.

09:22.595 --> 09:23.596
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.630
Let me explain, all right?

09:24.630 --> 09:25.619
There's nothing to explain.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.588
I told you not to eavesdrop,
and you did it again.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.303
You are a very sick person.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.638
I tried to announce myself,

09:32.638 --> 09:33.696
but I had a mouth full of apple,

09:34.173 --> 09:35.675
rendering me speechless.

09:35.675 --> 09:38.940
Oh. I was a cop. You think I
haven't heard that one before?

09:40.780 --> 09:41.769
You're just angry

09:42.281 --> 09:43.282
because I heard you lying to Ronee.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.284
You really expect to win Ronee's heart

09:45.284 --> 09:46.786
by inventing fictitious girlfriends?

09:46.786 --> 09:48.287
Sheila indeed.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.790
well, that's none of your business,

09:50.790 --> 09:51.991
and you weren't supposed to hear it.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.025
well, I did hear it.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.927
No, you overheard it.

09:54.927 --> 10:00.032
It's like an illegal
wiretap. It's inadmissible.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.134
. Dad, you cannot build
a relationship on lies

10:02.134 --> 10:03.636
Inadmissible. Dad...

10:03.636 --> 10:04.625
Inadmissible!

10:05.137 --> 10:06.138
Oh, fine.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.373
(door slams)

10:07.373 --> 10:08.362
(door slams)

10:21.654 --> 10:22.655
why can't your father

10:22.655 --> 10:25.157
just go to the concert by himself?

10:25.157 --> 10:26.692
Because Alfred Antin will be offended

10:26.692 --> 10:27.994
if we don't us e his tickets

10:27.994 --> 10:29.028
and then he won't paint our nursery.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.393
Don't you want to be
the one to go with him?

10:30.763 --> 10:32.098
Forget it, Niles.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.793
we flipped a coin and you
were the doo-wop-a-loser.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.104
Hey, Niles.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.806
Ready to
bop-bop- she-bop?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.808
Oh, dear God. Is it a dance?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.110
Am I going to have to move about?

10:44.110 --> 10:47.113
 No, you don't have to,
but you're going to want to

10:47.113 --> 10:48.080
Daphne?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.782
I'm pregnant.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.083
what does that have to do with it?

10:51.083 --> 10:53.753
It's my blanket excuse
until the baby is born.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.755
After that it'll be, "I
can't leave the baby. "

10:55.755 --> 10:56.744
Get used to it.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.061
Oh, Marty, hi.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.063
Ronee, hey.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.065
Oh, this is Richard.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.768
Martin, Daphne, Niles.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.069
Hello, Richard. Hi.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.771
Hello.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.773
So how do you all know each other?

11:13.773 --> 11:16.075
well, uh...

11:16.075 --> 11:17.133
Ronee was my baby-sitter.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.110
I was a little monster.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.117
And you?

11:25.117 --> 11:26.819
Um...

11:26.819 --> 11:29.117
Sheila! where have you been?

11:37.129 --> 11:39.131
This is my date, Sheila.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.833
Got stuck at work, huh?

11:40.833 --> 11:41.834
Uh, yeah?

11:41.834 --> 11:43.135
Yeah.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.124
Sheila's a model.

11:44.837 --> 11:48.136
She does all those
big auto and R V shows.

11:50.142 --> 11:53.134
point to something.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.152
wow, impressive. Nice meeting you.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.154
Let's get ours to go.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.856
But I thought...

12:03.856 --> 12:05.847
Roll with the punches, Dick.

12:09.862 --> 12:10.863
what are you doing?

12:10.863 --> 12:11.852
I'm trying to make her jealous.

12:12.164 --> 12:13.165
Just go with it.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.900
But I'm meeting my own date here.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.889
Dad, the concert starts in 1 5 minutes,

12:16.168 --> 12:17.863
and Alfred Antin will be
very angry if we're late.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.172
well, I can't leave unless
Sheila comes with me.

12:20.172 --> 12:23.175
Hello? Sheila has a date.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.872
Here are the tickets.
You and I are going.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.168
Oh, do we have to?

12:28.881 --> 12:29.882
Yes.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.747
Do we really need clouds on the ceiling?

12:31.817 --> 12:35.354
Couldn't we just push the
crib closer to the window?

12:35.354 --> 12:36.856
why even use a crib?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.347
Let's just put it in a pizza box.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.383
(laughing loudly)

12:44.864 --> 12:45.353
Stop it.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.867
 Oh, you! work with me here.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.357
Okay, okay.

12:54.874 --> 12:55.841
Roz?

12:55.841 --> 12:57.843
Larry. Hi.

12:57.843 --> 13:00.334
This is my dad.

13:00.846 --> 13:01.347
How you doing?

13:01.347 --> 13:02.336
Hello.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.338
You brought your dad on our date?

13:04.850 --> 13:05.851
Oh, of course not.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.853
He was just leaving. Aren't you, Dad?

13:07.853 --> 13:09.355
Yeah, but not until I finish my coffee.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.356
You don't have any coffee.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.857
Get me one, would you, Larry?

13:11.857 --> 13:13.359
Dad, what are you doing here?

13:13.359 --> 13:14.348
Hi, Roz. Hello.

13:14.860 --> 13:15.349
Hi.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.352
Is your brother joining us, too?

13:18.864 --> 13:20.366
He's not my brother.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.357
Oh, now, that' s no way to be.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.359
Still waiting on that coffee, Lar.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.374
Okay, what the hell is going on?

13:28.374 --> 13:29.375
Nothing.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.376
Hi, Frasier.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.877
Hi, Ronee.

13:31.877 --> 13:32.878
Nice to see you, Marty.

13:32.878 --> 13:33.879
Sheila.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.847
Take care. Bye.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.855
So you've been pressed
into service as Sheila, hmm?

13:42.855 --> 13:45.847
pressed is right. He
nearly bit my lip off.

13:47.359 --> 13:48.360
Here you go, Mr. Doyle.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.349
Ah, thanks.

13:49.862 --> 13:50.863
Come on, Larry. we 're leaving.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.865
It's nice meeting you, Mr. Doyle.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.366
And you can owe me on that coffee.

13:54.366 --> 13:58.370
It was $3. 75 and I flipped
a quarter in the tip jar.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.361
I'll be home early, Dad.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.378
Dad, when are you going
to stop playing games

14:06.378 --> 14:07.379
and tell her how you feel?

14:07.379 --> 14:08.881
It's too soon.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.382
we've only been seeing
each other a few weeks.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.884
I don't want to scare her off.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.875
How do you know you 're
going to scare her off?

14:14.386 --> 14:15.888
well, look at her, Fras.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.390
She's young. She's got
all these guys after her.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.893
I'm lucky she even
gave me a second glance.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.895
I don't want to blow i t by looking

14:22.895 --> 14:25.397
Like some desperate
old guy with no options.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.386
It's not desperate

14:26.899 --> 14:28.389
to tell somebody how
you feel about them.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.402
what if she doesn't feel the same way?

14:30.402 --> 14:33.098
what if she does and you never find out?

14:33.339 --> 14:35.000
Dad...

14:35.307 --> 14:37.009
just give her a call

14:37.009 --> 14:39.637
and tell her you want to talk to her.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.949
(grunts)

14:43.949 --> 14:46.252
was that a "leave me alone" grunt,

14:46.252 --> 14:48.621
or a "you've bested me again, son,

14:48.621 --> 14:51.021
with your unassailable logic" grunt?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.226
(grunts)

14:54.226 --> 14:55.921
I thought so.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.666
Hey, Dad.

15:00.666 --> 15:01.934
what you watching?

15:01.934 --> 15:03.035
Sports wrap-up.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.236
Sports wrap-up.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.239
That sounds like fun. Oof. (chuckles)

15:07.239 --> 15:10.606
Oh, gosh, that's not very sportsmanlike.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.444
I called her, okay.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.113
Not that it's any of your business.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.115
So...?

15:16.115 --> 15:17.616
I left a message.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.118
I'm glad she wasn't there.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.386
I don't know what I'll
say if she calls back.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.683
well, you did the right thing, Dad.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.188
I am proud of you.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.690
I don't know.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.191
The whole thing's making me nervous.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.227
You know, I know why
she's not calling me back.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.695
e She doesn't know how to tell m

15:29.695 --> 15:31.424
she's dropping me for
Richard. (doorbell rings)

15:31.764 --> 15:35.968
well, who said anything
about dropping you?

15:35.968 --> 15:39.131
. No one, apparently, or
you would've overheard it

15:43.108 --> 15:44.610
Oh, hi, Ronee.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.578
Hi, Frasier.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.068
Ronee, I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.582
well, I got your message and
I was in the neighborhood.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.072
So, what's up?

15:54.086 --> 15:56.588
Oh, uh...

15:56.588 --> 15:58.090
I was just heading out.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.591
what, at this hour?

15:59.591 --> 16:01.026
I never thought you
were such a night owl.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.261
Oh, yeah.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.252
Yeah, I love clubbin '.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.268
I-I thought you'd just call.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.971
well, you know, I was going
to, but it sounded like

16:11.971 --> 16:13.272
maybe we needed to
talk face-to-face.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.975
Yeah.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.966
Marty, is this about that woman

16:18.277 --> 16:19.979
I saw you with tonight?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.281
well... kind of.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.283
Yeah, I thought so.

16:24.283 --> 16:25.985
Look, whatever it is,

16:25.985 --> 16:27.987
why don't you just come out and say it.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.989
Yeah, all right.

16:29.989 --> 16:34.289
.. well, um... I'm not
the kind of guy who.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.664
Hey, you want a beer?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.199
Oh, boy, do I need one?

16:40.199 --> 16:41.700
No, I think we could both use one.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.201
(doorbell rings)

16:42.201 --> 16:43.702
would you get that?

16:43.702 --> 16:45.204
Frasier probably forgot his key.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.193
Yeah, sure.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.179
Oh, Sheila.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.443
I kind of thought your date was over.

16:56.615 --> 17:00.686
well... maybe it is...

17:00.686 --> 17:03.177
and maybe it isn't.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.694
Gotcha.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.696
Uh, just tell Marty, message received.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.188
Okay.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.403
Hey, Roz, what are you doing here?

17:17.403 --> 17:18.392
I found Frasier's
money clip . Is he home?

17:18.704 --> 17:19.771
No, uh-uh.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.272
where's Ronee?

17:21.272 --> 17:22.775
Oh, don't worry.

17:22.775 --> 17:26.779
Sheila showed Ronee the door.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.280
what?!

17:28.280 --> 17:30.783
what the hell did you do that for?!

17:30.783 --> 17:33.274
Hey, I have no control
over what Sheila does.

17:36.255 --> 17:39.258
Oh, good, Niles, you're
back . How was the concert?

17:39.258 --> 17:40.555
well, you're the one who
wanted that cloud mural.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.251
I'm sure pope Julius had to
jump through similar hoops

17:43.562 --> 17:44.551
to get Michelangelo
to paint his ceiling.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.265
Dear God, I think I just realized

17:46.265 --> 17:48.200
where I must've dropped my money clip.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.202
Ronee's car.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.504
She gave me a ride in
it the day I lost it.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.107
well, that's irresponsible of her.

17:55.107 --> 17:56.141
She just left it open.

17:56.141 --> 17:57.142
Excuse me.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.133
Oh, yes, of course.

17:59.445 --> 18:00.434
There we are.

18:01.146 --> 18:02.448
Thank you.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.450
Anyway, I thought I'd swing by

18:04.450 --> 18:06.441
and take us both out for a
nightcap. (engine starting)

18:07.119 --> 18:07.813
All right, great.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.289
By the way, Niles, I,
uh, I spoke with Dad

18:11.590 --> 18:14.593
and he has taken our advice
about talking things over..

18:14.593 --> 18:17.596
Mine and yours, that's
what I mean by "our. "

18:17.596 --> 18:22.301
Oh, take some responsibility
for once in your life, man.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.599
You could've at least warned m
that Sheila was on her way up.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.605
Ronee, it's all a misunderstanding.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.307
Marty, I really don't want to hear it.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.309
well, you're going to hear
it 'cause I'm not leaving.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.607
Fine, just get in the
car if you want to.

18:33.312 --> 18:36.615
we're going to sit right
here until you hear it all.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.284
Okay, go ahead.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.786
But you better make it good

18:40.786 --> 18:42.788
because I have a finely
tuned crap-ometer.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.790
There is no Sheila. Her name's Roz.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.280
She's Frasier's secretary.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.794
I just pretended we were together.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.195
Forget it, Marty.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.331
I know how this sounds, but it's true.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.166
why would you do that?

18:54.166 --> 18:57.536
Because I'd gotten these
concert tickets to impress you.

18:57.536 --> 19:00.539
And then when you said
you had a date, I got...

19:00.539 --> 19:04.243
well, I got jealous, so I
said I was getting a date, too.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.545
And then there you were in Nervosa,

19:06.545 --> 19:09.241
and when Roz came in, I made her Sheila.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.344
Do you believe me?

19:15.354 --> 19:18.857
. You know, it's actually a little hot

19:18.857 --> 19:19.846
Really?

19:25.564 --> 19:29.835
Look, Ronee, uh, maybe
I'm old-fashioned,

19:29.835 --> 19:32.337
but I know when something feels right.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.339
I don't want to see anybody else.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.842
I want to be exclusive.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.833
Go steady, whatever they call it now.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.838
well, that's my story.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.852
what about you?

19:46.852 --> 19:48.843
(sighs) : well...

19:49.354 --> 19:50.844
. God, it's freezing in here

19:51.223 --> 19:52.713
I had a blanket.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.434
Okay.

20:02.434 --> 20:05.871
Since we're being honest, uh,

20:05.871 --> 20:08.874
well, I-I've done my share of dating,

20:08.874 --> 20:11.866
and I haven't always
made the best choices.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.381
I've dated the bad guys,
the guys who can't commit,

20:16.381 --> 20:17.883
, the guys who won't grow up

20:17.883 --> 20:20.875
the creeps with the nice
suit, the pathological liars...

20:21.386 --> 20:23.388
Okay, I got it.

20:23.388 --> 20:28.360
Anyway, and then I started
dating this really good guy--

20:28.360 --> 20:29.657
you...

20:31.363 --> 20:33.365
... and I guess I-I just wanted

20:33.365 --> 20:35.367
to keep my options open with Richard

20:35.367 --> 20:37.358
because I wasn't sure
how you felt about me.

20:39.671 --> 20:42.367
But now I am.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.357
Now would be the time.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.660
to put your class ring
on a chain around my neck.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.362
I got one upstairs.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.353
You want to come get it?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.605
wait, wait.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.275
. I've got a better idea

21:16.275 --> 21:19.611
I know this secluded beach
that's miles away from anything.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.102
You want to go there
and steam up the windows?

21:22.547 --> 21:31.455
Oh, yeah.
