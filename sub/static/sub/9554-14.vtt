01:31.291 --> 01:32.224
Dad?

01:32.359 --> 01:34.225
Close. It's a relative.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.591
That's cute, Marion.
Isn't Dad here yet?

01:36.730 --> 01:39.563
- No. Richard went down to
the station to pick him up. -Oh.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.725
- Well, is everything ready?
- Just ready.

01:41.868 --> 01:44.337
The guest room is spic-and-span.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.667
- Ah, that's good.
- And Mrs. Kelly...

01:46.807 --> 01:49.173
Mrs. Kelly loaned us
this rocker.

01:49.309 --> 01:53.007
Oh, your dad is just
gonna have a lovely retirement.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.478
Rocking chair, huh?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.139
Well, I don't know, Marion.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.615
You know, my father's
a very dynamic guy.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.151
He's always on the go.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.016
You know, when I was a kid,

02:02.155 --> 02:04.317
he used to drag me
to baseball games

02:04.458 --> 02:06.619
and football games
and those policemen picnics.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.318
In the three-legged race,

02:08.461 --> 02:10.988
he used to drag <i>me</i>
across the finish line.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.623
Well, maybe I should
cancel the rocker.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.701
Yeah, I think you better--
if he sees the rocker

02:15.836 --> 02:17.531
he's only gonna
tell me to sit on it.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.403
Oh! Oh, well, he doesn't have
to sit all the time, you know.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.636
- You can take him to the
hardware store once a week. -Oh,

02:24.778 --> 02:26.143
he hates the hardware business.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.906
He doesn't hate it.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.949
Marion, any man who says
he'd rather eat bark

02:31.084 --> 02:34.054
than go into
the hardware business hates it.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.781
Besides, he still
treats me like a kid.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.256
He still calls me... sonny.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.357
Brrr! It's freezing!

02:42.496 --> 02:45.090
MARION: Get on the papers,
on the papers, dear.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.927
Take your galoshes off.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.934
Well, I'm all through,
uh, shoveling the walk.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.061
HOWARD: Oh good, good.
Here's your quarter.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.696
A quarter.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.740
Thanks, Diamond Jim.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.742
Wait, wait just a second.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.210
(sings fanfare)

03:00.347 --> 03:02.975
Here he is,
the Sheboygan Shamus,

03:03.116 --> 03:05.016
former Detective
Captain Sean Cunningham!

03:05.152 --> 03:06.983
Let's hear it for him!

03:10.057 --> 03:12.048
(others clapping,
speaking indistinctly)

03:12.192 --> 03:15.492
All right, all right.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.325
Enough! Enough.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.696
Enough, enough. Enough.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.236
Enough with the introductions,
let's have hugging and kissing.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.930
Oh, Dad, you just look...

03:26.073 --> 03:28.200
- Good to have you here.
- Marion, you look wonderful.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.537
And little Joanie... Joanie.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.343
And sonny.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.608
Give your old father a kiss.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.414
Now, wait a minute,
I am 47 years old.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.786
You'll never be too old
to kiss your father.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.654
I wasn't talking about kissing,

03:46.793 --> 03:48.955
I was talking
about you calling me sonny.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.927
Mm. Feisty.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.731
You know something, sonny?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.892
You got your mother's nose
and your uncle's belly,

03:56.036 --> 03:58.095
-but I still love you.
- Thanks, Dad.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.633
Uh, Marion,
how about the, uh...

04:00.774 --> 04:03.573
Oh. I'll be right back
with a little surprise.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.542
- SEAN: Huh?
- Oh. I'll help you, Mom.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.114
Dad, you look terrific.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.943
Thank you, thank you.
And you...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.711
well, at least
you retained your hair.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.914
All right.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.687
Listen, I want
to tell you something,

04:20.827 --> 04:22.295
I'm very sorry that I'm late.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.659
Dad, I'd like you
to meet Arthur Fonzarelli.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.062
- How do you do?
- Hey, you can call me the Fonz.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.260
Nice to meet you, Pops.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.372
You can call me Cap
if you like.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.565
All right, you got it, Cap.

04:44.084 --> 04:47.417
A cake-- now, that's
very touching, very touching.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.751
But it so happens
I didn't retire.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.519
- I knew it.
- You didn't retire? But...

04:53.660 --> 04:55.788
you're 65--
you turned in your badge.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.294
I didn't turn it in.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.126
They took it away from me.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.598
All these years they're
telling me how competent I am,

05:01.735 --> 05:03.430
how good I am
for the department,

05:03.570 --> 05:05.937
and then they promoted me
to captain of the detectives,

05:06.072 --> 05:09.634
and the day I became 65, they
said I was too old for the job,

05:09.776 --> 05:12.177
and just like that,
bip, bap, good-bye, Cap.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.246
Hey, I'll tell you
something, Cap,

05:14.381 --> 05:17.146
I think that is ridicumundo!

05:18.185 --> 05:19.482
Excuse me?

05:19.619 --> 05:22.680
Hey, what they do to elderly
people, you know, is stupid.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.188
You're right, absolutely right.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.123
And they gave me a gold watch
with a one-year guarantee.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.854
HOWARD: Look, Dad,
I-I'm sorry they retired you,

05:29.996 --> 05:31.521
but it really doesn't matter.

05:31.665 --> 05:36.364
Yes, and we've already contacted
several senior citizen groups.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.995
- I entered you in the
Shuffleboard Olympics. -Huh?

05:39.139 --> 05:41.437
Maybe you'll meet
some senior ladies.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.970
Are you listening
to this family?

05:45.111 --> 05:47.945
Hey, I don't tangle,
I just am a rent-ee.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.917
Well, I got news for all of you.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.179
I have no intention
sitting on my rump,

05:54.321 --> 05:56.755
playing checkers with a bunch
of decrepit old men!

05:56.890 --> 06:01.418
I'm gonna get myself a job,
and then maybe I would consider

06:01.561 --> 06:04.155
pinching a few
of your senior old ladies.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.163
Meantime,
you know somebody in town

06:06.299 --> 06:08.199
could use a good hired hand?

06:08.335 --> 06:09.768
- Well...
- RICHIE: Hey, Gramps,

06:09.903 --> 06:12.770
-why don't you help Dad out
at his hardware store? -Uh...

06:12.906 --> 06:16.706
That's a very nice thought,
Richie, but I'd rather eat bark.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.140
You want a job?
I'll get you a job.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.748
You work with me
down at the garage.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.144
I need part-time help
in the mornings,

06:23.283 --> 06:25.217
you know, till you get
something else. How about it?

06:25.352 --> 06:27.513
You got yourself a deal,
young fella. When do I start?

06:27.654 --> 06:29.918
- First thing tomorrow morning.
- I'll be there at 6:00 a.m.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.786
Hey, don't show up
till about 7:30.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.621
I'll stand guard.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.740
- Hi, Cap.
- Hello.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.837
I finished lunch, Fonz.
What's up?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.502
All right, Chachi,
come here, hold this.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.840
Hold the screwdriver.
Right there.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.074
I got the wrong wrench.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.207
(engine idling)

06:59.452 --> 07:01.318
- Uh, Cap?
- Yeah?

07:01.454 --> 07:03.616
I can't reach it from here.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.021
Oh. Well, then you
should be over here.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.685
- Hey, that is a great idea.
- Yeah.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.320
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Yeah.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.626
Boy, you guys make a great team.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.600
Yeah, right,
like Abbott and Costello.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.801
- Cap?
- Yeah?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.966
Uh, I-l think we have things
covered here, you know?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.907
Why don't you go in
and check my books,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.309
-see if they're up to date, huh?
- Oh.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.014
All right, tap it,
lightly. Tap...

07:31.151 --> 07:32.448
No, no, give it
a good whack, son.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.646
-(yells, groans in pain)
- Whoa! Fonz! I'm sorry.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.189
It's all right,
it's all right. Don't touch.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.293
It still works.
It's all right.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.456
All right!
(mutters)

07:46.599 --> 07:47.999
That takes care of that.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.568
FONZIE:
What are you talking about?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.193
Aw, some girl talking crazy.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.306
What do you mean, talking crazy?
What do you mean?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.203
She wanted to talk
to "Sugar Lips."

07:55.342 --> 07:56.536
It was Rochelle.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.542
He hung up on Rochelle?
She hates that!

07:58.678 --> 08:00.544
- I didn't do it.
- I know. Mm, mm!

08:00.680 --> 08:02.808
All right, look, you got
to do me a favor. Here.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.475
You take this money and buy her
some perfume. Buy her the best.

08:05.618 --> 08:06.847
Spend the whole dollar.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.285
And then you tell her:
Boy Scout tent,

08:09.422 --> 08:11.220
8:00, Saturday night, be there!

08:11.358 --> 08:12.757
-(claps hands)
- Hey!

08:12.892 --> 08:14.884
(strained chuckling)

08:16.496 --> 08:19.397
There's a note on my wall
for an auto supply store.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.001
They're supposed to send me
a muffler, they don't send it.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.160
Go in there and find out
what's wrong, huh?

08:24.304 --> 08:26.670
I saw that note this morning,
and I called them.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.365
And I want
to tell you something,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.909
I gave that supply store
a piece of my mind.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.706
Hey, that's great. They're gonna
be sending it right over, right?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.815
- Oh-ho, better than that.
- Better? All right!

08:35.948 --> 08:37.280
Much better than that.

08:37.417 --> 08:41.115
From now, you're free to do
business with another place.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.956
SEAN:
Something wrong?

08:45.091 --> 08:47.219
- I got the wrong tools.
- Oh.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.727
You know,
I was noticing something here.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.764
- I could help you here; this
coil is very loose. -No, Cap...

08:52.899 --> 08:55.027
- No, no, real...
-(loud pop)

08:59.606 --> 09:03.542
I've never seen one
do that before.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.839
FONZIE:
Mr. 0., <i>I</i> got to talk to you

09:06.980 --> 09:09.574
-about your father.
- Oh, how's he doing?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.775
Grease gun--
didn't know it was loaded.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.647
Oh, well, it's...

09:13.787 --> 09:15.687
it's his first day
on the job, Fonzie.

09:15.822 --> 09:16.914
Yeah, I know, I know.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.319
It's his first day...

09:18.458 --> 09:20.392
and his last--
I got to fire him.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.552
- You got to fire him?
- Yeah.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.664
Uh, uh, it's not like
you think, see?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.026
He's a very good worker.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.362
I mean, I didn't realize
he was that fast.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.492
You know, he did everything
before lunch.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.605
L-I don't know how
to tell you this.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.140
I want to tell you
in the most diplomatic terms

09:35.275 --> 09:36.572
that I know, you know?

09:36.709 --> 09:38.336
He's driving me wacko!

09:40.513 --> 09:42.209
- Diplomatic, huh?
- Yeah.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.317
Yeah. Well, I understand, Fonz.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.352
You see, my father
is used to being a leader,

09:47.487 --> 09:48.886
a take-charge guy.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.149
He's a very dynamic man.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.886
I know sometimes he can drive
you crazy, but he means well.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.086
Yeah, I understand that.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.721
I have a great deal
of likeness for him.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.425
I just don't have
the heart to tell him.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.058
Yeah.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.937
All right, I'll tell him.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.303
You are the greatest, Mr. C.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.347
Oh, hi, Dad.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.416
♪ Oh, the night

10:17.550 --> 10:19.109

10:30.330 --> 10:33.322

10:33.466 --> 10:35.400
Say something.
I've seen better smiles

10:35.535 --> 10:38.368
and better looks on faces
in lineups, for crying out loud.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.473
Listen, while you're
in such a good Irish mood,

10:40.607 --> 10:42.370
there is something
I have to tell you.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.533
- There is?
- Yes.

10:43.676 --> 10:44.769
Hold it.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.846
I've got some news for you.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.581
Ta-da!

10:51.718 --> 10:53.709
You've enlisted!

10:55.221 --> 10:58.123
You know, you've been playing
with nuts and bolts so long

10:58.258 --> 10:59.691
you got a screw loose.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.659
I just joined the campus police.

11:02.795 --> 11:03.785
Richie's college?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.261
- Ten-four.
- Oh...

11:05.398 --> 11:07.594
Now, before you tell me
your news,

11:07.734 --> 11:09.998
- I got a bit of a problem.
- Yeah?

11:10.136 --> 11:12.127
With that nice Fonzie.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.674
I... I don't know how
to tell him I'm quitting.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.946
I'll tell him.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.674
<i>AL:
Now, now, wait a minute, guys,</i>

11:23.816 --> 11:26.843
<i>I</i> got a rule around here:
No shoes, no short, no service.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.613
(goat bleating)

11:30.557 --> 11:33.185
It's Beta Chi's mascot--
we kidnapped it.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.691
Get it? Kid? Goat?

11:34.827 --> 11:35.988
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.528
I Still got it.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.360
You do. That'll teach 'em
for taking our mascot,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.696
-the Sacred Stuffed Pelican.
- That's right.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.098
Goats? Pelicans?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.968
I think I'll skip college
and go to a zoo. (laughs)

11:49.042 --> 11:50.600
Come over...
Come here, come here.

11:50.743 --> 11:51.870
- Come here.
-(goat bleats)

11:52.011 --> 11:54.378
No, no, I didn't want
the goat to hear this.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.573
Oh. Back, back.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.083
But, you see,
he's not allowed in here.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.414
Guys, guys, cheese it!
My grandfather's coming!

12:01.554 --> 12:03.318
- The campus cop?! -We can't
let him see the goat.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.446
You've got to hide...

12:04.591 --> 12:06.183
Oh, okay,
I'll hide in the bathroom.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.022
- No, Al, the goat, not you.
- Oh, good idea.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.097
- Come here, Fido. Here you go,
Fido! -Push! Push! -(bleating)

12:12.231 --> 12:14.325
- Come on, Fido.
-(indistinct talking)

12:14.467 --> 12:16.629
RICHIE:
Oh, Gramps, Gramps,

12:16.769 --> 12:18.396
-what a surprise.
- Huh?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.665
Oh, I want to introduce you
to Al Delvecchio.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.799
Al, come here. This is
my grandfather, Sean Cunningham.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.075
Now, that's a nose!

12:34.887 --> 12:36.753
- Hey, Richie, Cap, Al.
- Oh, hello.

12:36.889 --> 12:39.984
- I got business. I got a phone
call. Rochelle. -Oh, wait!

12:40.126 --> 12:43.255
- Fonz, hey, Fonz!
- Fonz, no, Fonz!

12:43.396 --> 12:44.921
Heyyy!

12:45.064 --> 12:46.896
(goat bleats)

12:47.033 --> 12:48.023
(door opens)

12:49.702 --> 12:51.227
Get him out here.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.536
Now, I don't care why he's here.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.199
I don't know how you got him
in here.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.935
I never thought I'd have
to make up a rule like this,

12:58.077 --> 12:59.443
but here it is and memorize it:

12:59.579 --> 13:02.378
no goats in my office.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.573
Dig it?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.184
(goat baas)

13:05.318 --> 13:06.683
That's the stolen goat.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.412
You two are under arrest.

13:08.554 --> 13:12.150
Arrest?
(VEHJS)

13:12.291 --> 13:14.192
Uh, Gramps,
you can't arrest these guys.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.693
These two were apprehended
with stolen livestock.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.094
Well, it's a... it's a gag,

13:19.232 --> 13:20.426
a college prank.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.092
Well, I-l see
what's going on now,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.102
-just hijinks, is that it?
- POTSIE: Yeah, right.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.035
Well, I-l got kind of
carried away, boys.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.572
This is the first excitement
I've had

13:28.708 --> 13:29.971
-since I've been on the job.
-(Potsie chuckles)

13:30.109 --> 13:31.634
And I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.974
I'm gonna close my eyes
and count to three

13:34.113 --> 13:36.275
and if you're still here,
you're under arrest.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.543
- One, two, -Thank you, sir.
Thank you, thank you.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.414
- Th ree.
-(goat bleats)

13:41.621 --> 13:44.317
You're under arrest
for stealing a goat.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.449
(chuckles)
N-Now, wait, Officer, you see,

13:47.593 --> 13:49.721
what happened
is that the Beta Chi with the...

13:49.862 --> 13:52.730
They left the goat.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.528
Here I am, demoted
to being a-a goat shepherd.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.561
Come on, come on. Come on.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.696
(goat baas)

14:09.482 --> 14:10.881
ls everything all right
on the job?

14:11.017 --> 14:13.349
Everything is fine on the job.
I'm quitting.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.976
Well, what happened?

14:15.121 --> 14:16.987
What happened? Cap Cunningham,

14:17.123 --> 14:19.353
reduced to arresting a goat?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.324
- A goat?
- Yeah, goat.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.156
I'm used to arresting people,
not animals.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.889
The hijinks, the pranks.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.091
Do me a favor, sonny, get me
a nice glass of warm milk,

14:28.234 --> 14:31.033
and I'll go upstairs
and brush up on my checkers.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.365
So that's it, huh?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.768
You're giving up just like that.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.272
What else do you want me to do?

14:35.408 --> 14:36.773
I'm trying, I try-

14:36.909 --> 14:40.368
Society today wants a man my age
to pack it in.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.844
Oh, don't give me any of that.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.506
There are people
a lot older than you

14:43.649 --> 14:45.174
that have done big things
with their lives.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.182
Yeah? Name one.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.752
Thomas Edison.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.548
Name two.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.883
Winston Churchill,

14:51.023 --> 14:53.151
Mark Twain, Albert Einstein.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.158
And what about Grandma Moses,
huh?

14:55.294 --> 14:58.093
She started a whole new life
for herself at 65.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.394
She was 65 years old
before she ever painted.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.798
Sonny, I can't paint.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.734
There are a lot of other things
you can do.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.567
You could...
you could learn real estate,

15:07.707 --> 15:09.573
you could go back to school
and become an accountant,

15:09.709 --> 15:10.767
how 'bout that?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.435
What's the sense
of learning something new?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.514
They don't hire anybody today
over 45.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.844
Yeah, you're right.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.384
I'll tell you what, Dad,
I think maybe you just...

15:20.520 --> 15:22.511
should go out and spend the rest
of your life

15:22.655 --> 15:25.090
sitting in the park
and feeding the pigeons.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.420
And then when people say to me,
"Whatever happened to your dad?"

15:27.560 --> 15:29.085
it won't bother me
'cause I'll simply say,

15:29.228 --> 15:32.391
-"Oh, haven't you heard?
He just gave up." -All right.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.728
Or get yourself a room
at the Pfister Retirement Home.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.063
Maybe you can find somebody else
to chip in with you,

15:37.203 --> 15:39.069
get bulk rate bird seed.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.004
Oh, I don't even know why
I waited up for you.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.132
I'm going to bed.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.947
Good night, Dad.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.076
Good night.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.015
(dance music playing)

16:04.197 --> 16:07.189
'(swig ends)
- Hey! -(cheering)

16:09.569 --> 16:11.435
Thank you! Thank you.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.095
I have an announcement to make.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.368
Will the owner of a gray Beetle
please go outside.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.841
It just ran off with a ladybug.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.776
(rimshot)

16:20.913 --> 16:23.109
(indistinct chatter)

16:23.249 --> 16:25.240
Thank you.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.186
I thought you said
it was a surefire joke.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.688
It is,
if you wear a rubber nose.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.292
Hey, Gramps!

16:33.426 --> 16:35.485
- Richie.
- Gramps, wh-what's going on?

16:35.628 --> 16:38.154
- How do I look?
- Well, you look, uh...

16:38.297 --> 16:40.823
-you look fine.
Y-You look terrific. -Good.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.059
Why do you look terrific?

16:42.201 --> 16:45.068
Richie, uh, my life took
a complete change today.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.695
L-I'm gonna be a singer.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.307
- A singer? Gramps,
you don't know anything -Yeah.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.408
About show business.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.907
Yeah, I know.
Isn't that exciting?

16:51.043 --> 16:53.069
L-I mean, it's a whole new life.
I mean...

16:53.212 --> 16:55.203
Uh, look, I got no time
to talk to you about...

16:55.348 --> 16:56.679
I'll talk to you about it later.
I got to get ready.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.181
- B-But, Gramps...
- Not now, Richie.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.343
Yeah, but s-singing? I...

17:00.486 --> 17:03.752
He's gonna sing.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.415
- POTSIE: Hey, Fonz.
- RALPH: Hiya, Fonz.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.559
Uh, Fonz? C-Can I just talk
to you for a minute, please?

17:12.698 --> 17:15.566
You're interrupting my lips.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.636
Well, this is very important.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.797
All right, girls,
keep your lips moistened, huh?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.875
All right,
what's the importantness?

17:24.010 --> 17:25.807
My grandfather.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.344
He's gonna be a singer.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.074
Yeah, I just saw him. I think
that's great for Cap, huh?

17:30.216 --> 17:31.740
Yeah, but he's gonna sing here.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.352
I don't want him
to embarrass himself.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.147
People are gonna laugh at him.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.688
Do you know the extent
of his singing experience?

17:37.823 --> 17:39.951
Me and Joanie on his knee,
him singing...

17:40.092 --> 17:41.958
♪ Tippy, tippy toe, tippy toe ♪

17:42.094 --> 17:44.620
Uh, Red, that's...

17:44.764 --> 17:46.925
♪ Tippy, tippy tin, tippy tin ♪

17:47.066 --> 17:49.034
No, no, Fonz. It's...

17:49.168 --> 17:50.693
That's...

17:50.836 --> 17:53.635
Look at this. I'm arguing
in song. What am I, crazy?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.502
Now, look, uh, the thing is,

17:55.641 --> 17:57.166
I think it's great
for your grandfather.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.572
It's gonna start his blood
going.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.906
He's looking
for something new, huh?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.639
- There you go.
- But, Fonz, he's gonna...

18:01.781 --> 18:04.307
Now, look, just to ensure
that nobody laughs,

18:04.450 --> 18:07.249
I'm gonna go to the booths and
I'm gonna say, "Don't laugh."

18:07.386 --> 18:08.911
Oh, good. Thanks.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.579
Don't laugh.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.589
Right.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.591
Listen up.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.593
There's an elderly gentleman
gonna come out here

18:16.729 --> 18:18.857
who's gonna sing a song.
He might be funny.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.523
-(girls giggle)
- Hold it.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.862
If you don't laugh,
there's a good shot you go,

18:23.002 --> 18:26.836
each one of you,
to Inspiration Point with me.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.576
Richard, where's Dad?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.441
He left a note for us
to meet him here.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.106
Yeah, he's here.
He's getting dressed in a tux.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.945
- What?
- He's singing.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.645
Well, I'm gonna put a stop
to this.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.346
Ladies and gentlemen...

18:43.489 --> 18:45.924
- I guess it's too late. Dad, you
might as well sit down. -Mm.

18:46.058 --> 18:50.791
Don't order anything.
I hear they had a goat in here.

18:50.930 --> 18:54.127
AL: I have a special treat
for you tonight

18:54.266 --> 18:56.394
because making his debut
on this stage

18:56.535 --> 18:58.401
is a wonderful entertainer.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.700
The one, the only
Cap Cunningham!

19:01.841 --> 19:03.832
(cheering and applause)

19:04.844 --> 19:06.437
Thank you.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.206
Thank you very much,
young people.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.213
L-I hope we'll be able
to entertain you tonight.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.750
You know, the most remarkable
thing happened to me.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.480
I went out to the Pfister,
uh, Retirement Home.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.113
You kids would be astounded

19:18.257 --> 19:21.784
to learn how much good talent
just lying around in that home,

19:21.927 --> 19:23.452
wasting away.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.120
Well, I put a stop to that,

19:25.264 --> 19:26.664
especially for these fellows
and myself.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.166
So let's bring 'em out,
see if we can't entertain you.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.099
- Come on out here, boys.
-(cheering and applause)

19:35.474 --> 19:38.171
Thank you, thank you.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.677
Now he's the boss again.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.144
Just to let you know
who they are,

19:42.281 --> 19:46.309
-on piano we have Raymond Brown
at age 71. -(drumroll)

19:46.452 --> 19:49.581
Picking the banjo,
68-year-old Frenchie LaSalle.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.851
-(drumroll) -And our 70-year-old
bass player Russell Weathers.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.393
-(drumroll) -The baby

19:55.528 --> 19:57.997

Bill Stumpp. -(drumroll)

19:58.130 --> 20:00.099
And on trombone, Pete Collins.

20:00.232 --> 20:03.100

20:03.235 --> 20:05.033
our drummer is Sylvester Rice.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.607
-(trombone toots)
- Oh, Al.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.937
Al, uh-uh, Pete would like you

20:11.077 --> 20:12.874
to-to turn the heat up
a little bit.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.174
