WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:03.571
(rock music playing)

00:07.841 --> 00:12.046
* I'm just a happy kid...

00:12.080 --> 00:14.548
WOMAN:
Shaza, finish

00:14.582 --> 00:16.350
and help me
set the table.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.585
Dinner's ready.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.687
Hadi, I asked you
to shut that off

00:19.720 --> 00:21.055
five minutes ago.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.490
Your father will be here
any minute.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.094
Hey, Mom, do you think
I can ask Dad tonight?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.229
About buying
a new laptop?

00:28.262 --> 00:28.896
It's your funeral.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.364
I need a new
cell phone.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.133
Mine sucks.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.535
If you get a new laptop,
I get a new cell phone.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.137
I need it for schoolwork.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.271
Yeah, right.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.140
*

00:48.182 --> 00:49.383
MAN:
Wait!

00:49.417 --> 00:50.384
I got family there.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.285
WOMAN:
Kaleem!

00:51.319 --> 00:52.553
- I got family!
- Kaleem!

00:52.586 --> 00:53.354
In the house, Asha!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.622
- Don't! Get back!
- In the house!

00:54.655 --> 00:56.190
- Mom?!
- Go get inside!

00:56.224 --> 00:57.391
Call 911.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.527
No!

00:59.560 --> 01:02.196
I can't thank you enough
for your help, Charlie.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.632
Your work on algebraic
statistics was essential

01:04.665 --> 01:06.234
to getting my research
published.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.503
Oh, well, are you going
to, uh, present this anywhere?

01:09.537 --> 01:11.239
There's a seminar
on Current Models

01:11.272 --> 01:14.408
in Recombinant Methodology
this summer in Florence, Italy.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.644
Ah. Firenze, mio preferito.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.312
And as coauthor
of the article,

01:18.346 --> 01:20.714
you are, of course, invited
to help present the work.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.150
LARRY:
I have to confess,

01:22.183 --> 01:23.751
this whole business
of rearranging

01:23.784 --> 01:25.453
DNA to suit
human needs...

01:25.486 --> 01:27.221
Listen, I find this

01:27.255 --> 01:30.158
very exciting
in this rather,

01:30.191 --> 01:32.726
uh, life-threatening,
world-ending sort of way.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.396
(laughs) The ability
to employ a more rapid

01:35.429 --> 01:38.299
and reliable de novo
DNA synthesis

01:38.332 --> 01:40.201
can lead to the creation
of so many useful,

01:40.234 --> 01:43.271
practical applications.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.272
Professor Phillip Sanjrani?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.273
Yes.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.240
Special Agent William Fraley.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.409
I'm going to have to ask
you to come with me.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.211
Well, why?
What's this all about?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.379
There must be
some mistake.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.513
My brother's Agent Don...

01:52.546 --> 01:53.281
I'm aware of who your brother
is.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.217
There's no mistake,
Dr. Eppes.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.918
Look, I'm happy
to cooperate.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.620
Only tell me what this is about.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.321
We will.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.922
Charlie, you work with the FBI.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.291
What's happening?

02:03.324 --> 02:04.192
I don't know.
I-I'll...

02:04.225 --> 02:05.459
find out.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.228
(car engine starting)

02:10.464 --> 02:11.565
Well, what happened was,

02:11.599 --> 02:13.634
two men were abducted
at gunpoint. They're missing.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.304
Now, they were both members of
the Pakistan International Fund,

02:16.337 --> 02:18.639
which is a local group
suspected of being a cover

02:18.672 --> 02:20.941
for an extremist cell.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.176
Counter-terrorism seems
to think that these

02:22.210 --> 02:25.746
abductions may be some kind
of prelude to a terrorist act.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.681
Okay, what does a
terrorist cell have to do

02:27.715 --> 02:29.383
with the arrest of a
university professor?

02:29.417 --> 02:30.851
Well, your colleague
Phil Sanjrani was a member

02:30.884 --> 02:33.387
of the group, and he's one
of about a dozen members

02:33.421 --> 02:34.488
that they brought in
for questioning.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.456
And what's
his actual connection?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.625
To put it bluntly, Charlie,
the DC office

02:37.658 --> 02:39.827
suspects your friend
of being a terrorist.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.263
Hey, Charlie, look,
we're definitely gonna need

02:42.296 --> 02:43.631
your help with this,
all right? Can you come in?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.709
Kaleem Rafiq was abducted

02:55.743 --> 02:57.545
by masked gunmen
in front of his home.

02:57.578 --> 03:01.249
Ronald Jamali left his office
for lunch, never returned.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.284
Now, both are members
of a non-profit

03:03.317 --> 03:05.353
called the Pakistan
International Fund.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.455
Claims to raise money
for rural Pakistan

03:07.488 --> 03:09.423
and Bangladesh,
but we have evidence,

03:09.457 --> 03:11.492
funds could be going
to jihadist groups.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.927
These abductions
that signal an imminent attack?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.563
Yeah, we think so.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.266
Now, since 9/11, we've stopped
several terror plots

03:18.299 --> 03:19.767
thanks to
informants.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.802
Yeah, al-Qaeda's now
instructing all their operatives

03:21.835 --> 03:23.504
to eliminate leaks
prior to attacks.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.339
And you're thinking
these guys were somehow

03:25.373 --> 03:26.674
a threat to the group?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.509
That's why the
director flew me out

03:28.542 --> 03:30.344
from DC on a
military jet.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.613
We have to find the
leadership of the cell.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.882
Now, it will
be hidden.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.885
Some operatives will be
deep cover, not openly linked

03:37.918 --> 03:39.587
to the PIF.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.589
Okay, well, I guess
that's where I can help.

03:41.622 --> 03:45.359
You know, in the past,
we've used math to identify

03:45.393 --> 03:47.795
the covert structure
of organizations.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.498
Sure. Like the social network
kind of thing, right?

03:50.531 --> 03:51.732
Well, actually,
since we're saying

03:51.765 --> 03:53.534
that the NSA has a database

03:53.567 --> 03:55.436
of phone intercepts
on this group,

03:55.469 --> 03:58.506
I'll be using an analysis based
on Byzantine fault-tolerance.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.708
With a name like that, I don't
even want to ask, Charlie.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.477
It's just a way of
finding faulty components

04:03.511 --> 04:04.878
in computing systems.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.547
FRALEY:
How do computers

04:06.580 --> 04:08.516
relate to a terrorist cell?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.884
Well, think of a rowing team.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.587
And imagine that one rower
is secretly working

04:13.621 --> 04:14.988
against the rest of the team.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.392
What math will do is look at
the water in the boat's wake

04:18.426 --> 04:19.560
and determine
which oarsman is working

04:19.593 --> 04:20.928
against the rest of the team.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.563
The missing men in this case

04:22.596 --> 04:24.565
are working
against the terror cell.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.367
- Just like your oarsman.
- Right.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.701
Math will not only
identify them...

04:27.735 --> 04:30.771
But it tells us who
the other guys in the boat are.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.939
That's it.

04:31.972 --> 04:32.873
Can it tell us
where the boat's going?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.075
In other words,
what the cell's planning?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.010
That's probably asking a lot
of the metaphor.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.380
It is, but
if there's enough information

04:39.413 --> 04:41.549
on the NSA intercepts, then...

04:41.582 --> 04:43.551
Okay, look, you pursue that,
and we just got

04:43.584 --> 04:46.053
to find out as much information
about these two as we can.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.988
Right?

04:49.723 --> 04:50.691
Hey...

04:51.992 --> 04:53.527
So, look, you know,

04:53.561 --> 04:55.696
I know Phil Sanjrani's
a member of the PIF,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.365
but he's not
a terrorist.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.599
He's a scientist.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.000
Right,
I understand your concern,

05:00.033 --> 05:01.935
but the guy e-mailed
instructions for a bioweapon

05:01.969 --> 05:03.070
to Pakistan.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.907
I didn't know that.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.647
My husband was abducted
in front of our home,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.816
here in Los Angeles,
yet you ask me

05:15.849 --> 05:17.985
about a trip
to Karachi eight years ago,

05:18.018 --> 05:20.087
and phone calls
to his cousin in Kashmir?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.424
We just need to pursue every
avenue of the investigation.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.892
You aren't pursuing
my husband's case.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.660
You're investigating him
as a terrorist

05:26.694 --> 05:28.962
because we're Pakistani,
because we're Muslim?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.864
How much time will you waste
convicting him

05:30.898 --> 05:32.733
when you could be trying
to find him?

05:32.766 --> 05:35.669
The only way I can help you
is if you answer my questions.

05:35.703 --> 05:39.607
My husband has been
in this country for 25 years.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.709
He is a business owner.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.343
He's not an extremist.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.681
The Pakistan International
Fund is a charity,

05:47.715 --> 05:51.619
helping people in rural regions
of Pakistan and Bangladesh.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.422
We are not political.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.789
Hamad Mazari.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.526
And what's your role
in the organization?

05:58.559 --> 05:59.460
Mostly fundraising.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.629
We're all volunteers,
we do what we can.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.764
Well, we're gonna need
to examine your membership

06:03.797 --> 06:05.666
and fundraising records,
as well as all telephone

06:05.699 --> 06:07.000
and computer information.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.002
No. I don't think so.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.772
Sir, two of your members
were kidnapped.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.774
Which doesn't mean
we help you conduct a witch hunt

06:13.807 --> 06:15.809
through our
membership.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.778
You aren't treating us as
victims, and you know it.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.147
- I can get a search warrant.
- Go ahead.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.152
Sir, what do you think

06:25.185 --> 06:27.755
happened to Rafiq
and Jamali?

06:27.788 --> 06:30.691
When foreign-born Muslims
go missing in this country,

06:30.724 --> 06:33.193
they tend to turn up
in federal detention.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.729
The CIA's got a
history of this.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.698
Why don't you check with them?

06:39.500 --> 06:40.834
It wasn't us.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.736
The CIA doesn't do this.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.904
Not in this country.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.874
We've heard that sometimes
you guys do make exceptions.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.210
This conversation is limited
to the specifics of your case.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.780
It's also limited to
an outdoor location.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.114
DAVID: Any reason you didn't
want

06:54.147 --> 06:56.149
to have this conversation
in your office?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.986
You needed to see me right away,
you got me on my lunch hour.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.722
Office or sidewalk,
the answer is the same.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.492
The agency had nothing to do
with these abductions.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.193
COLBY: Okay, if it wasn't you
guys,

07:06.226 --> 07:08.596
then who else does
this sort of thing?

07:08.629 --> 07:10.864
The FBI.

07:14.868 --> 07:15.669
Phil's an
American citizen.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.738
He's been at CalSci
for eight years.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.474
You didn't try to call a lawyer
or anything, did you?

07:20.508 --> 07:21.675
I may have made
some calls, yeah.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.143
Charlie, you can't
be doing that.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.244
He's a colleague of mine.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.846
I don't care.
You work for us.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.515
As a consultant,
not an agent.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.916
SANJRANI:
My work is for use

07:28.949 --> 07:30.083
in agriculture

07:30.117 --> 07:32.219
to develop disease-resistant
crops.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.187
Your research is restricted.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.790
It's illegal to send it
to hostile foreign entities.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.926
Restricted?
Nobody informed me of that.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.630
The list of restricted
information is classified.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.132
SANJRANI: Then how would I know
I couldn't send it?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.266
Why would you send
any information

07:46.299 --> 07:47.267
to religious extremists?

07:47.300 --> 07:51.839
I contacted scientists working
on crop yields

07:51.872 --> 07:54.875
in a region suffering
from famine and starvation.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.244
You sent cutting-edge work
in engineered genome sequencing

07:57.277 --> 07:58.812
to a university linked

07:58.846 --> 07:59.947
to groups that hate this
country.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.682
No!

08:01.715 --> 08:02.850
I sent my work

08:02.883 --> 08:04.652
to respected researchers.

08:08.856 --> 08:09.923
(siren blaring)

08:13.093 --> 08:14.728
Hey.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.997
Agent Sinclair?

08:19.066 --> 08:20.233
It's Rafiq's wallet.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.235
Worker found it
inside the warehouse.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.804
We saw it matched
the victim.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.938
Did you guys find anything else?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.173
We just started looking.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.541
All right. Thanks.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.960
Got a nice little
blood trail there.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.277
Oh!

09:37.310 --> 09:39.046
COLBY:
Looks like Rafiq.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.016
And Jamali.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.087
(camera shutter clicks)

09:47.120 --> 09:49.923
Both men were beaten,
tortured with electricity.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.659
To see
if they leaked information.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.360
Hey, guys, take
a look at this.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.395
Found at the scene.
It's a trigger pin.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.329
Trigger pin? For what?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.397
For one of these.

09:57.430 --> 10:01.168
RPG-7. Russian-made
rocket launcher.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.036
Bunker buster. So the
trigger pins are often

10:03.070 --> 10:05.105
shipped separately, and they're
hard to come by, so if you have

10:05.138 --> 10:06.373
the pins, you got
the rockets.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.775
Damn.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.676
Yeah.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.543
We found these

10:10.577 --> 10:14.314
at the home of one of the other
dead men, Ronald Jamali.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.184
Blueprints
from four high schools.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.119
A rocket attack
on a high school?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.321
They've already got the rockets.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.399
Watch the schools,
but keep it low-key.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.735
They know we're onto them,
they'll just switch targets.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.836
We're working
these weapons contacts

10:35.869 --> 10:37.204
to see if there's
word out anywhere.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.974
Hey. So I'm
still working

10:41.008 --> 10:42.943
on tracking the dead men's
connections to the PIF.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.211
However, I need to tell you

10:44.244 --> 10:45.378
about some other
preliminary findings.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.947
Okay. What are they?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.448
Uh, just that my
analysis has been

10:48.481 --> 10:50.117
unable to identify components

10:50.150 --> 10:52.419
that correlate
to any expected system.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.354
- What are you saying?
- The PIF

10:54.387 --> 10:57.190
does not fit the profile
for any known terror group.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.027
According to your
computer logic analysis?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.329
No, actually, according
to the FBI's own criteria:

11:02.362 --> 11:03.396
the lack

11:03.430 --> 11:04.698
of religious ties,

11:04.732 --> 11:05.933
its membership, its structure,

11:05.966 --> 11:08.836
its activities--
all atypical.

11:08.869 --> 11:12.405
There is no sign of any covert
organization within this group.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.207
And I also have to say

11:14.241 --> 11:15.943
that Phil Sanjrani's
connection to this case

11:15.976 --> 11:17.878
is entirely coincidental.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.380
Or maybe it's coincidental
that he's a friend of yours?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.449
Yeah, he's a friend of mine,
and you guys came across

11:22.482 --> 11:24.351
his work because
he's a member of the PIF.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.418
You assume
that his work

11:25.452 --> 11:28.188
is terror-related because
you assume that the PIF

11:28.221 --> 11:29.923
- is a terrorist group.
- DON: No, Charlie,

11:29.957 --> 11:32.059
the guy makes
synthetic pathogens.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.126
FRALEY:
And he sends his

11:33.160 --> 11:34.361
information to Pakistan.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.429
His work is in crop development.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.098
It's designed to
create new strains

11:38.131 --> 11:40.033
of food crops resistant
to drought and insects,

11:40.067 --> 11:41.735
which are both
very, very big

11:41.769 --> 11:43.771
problems in the farming regions
of Pakistan.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.806
You know what, you're a
mathematician; this is biology.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.207
Well, what does
that have to do with it?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.742
Hundreds of scientists
work in Phil's field.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.143
- You going to arrest them all?
- If they're

11:50.177 --> 11:51.812
connected to a terrorist
group, yeah.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.446
What if the PIF
isn't a terrorist group?

11:53.480 --> 11:54.381
What if it's a charity?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.383
Don't get many charity groups
torturing

11:56.416 --> 11:57.951
and executing their own members.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.219
MEGAN:
And there is the matter

11:59.252 --> 12:01.088
of the rocket launchers,
Charlie.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.389
(sighs)

12:02.422 --> 12:04.391
Hey, I-I'm willing.
I'm more than willing

12:04.424 --> 12:05.592
to reevaluate
my methodology.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.028
I would just suggest that
you might want to do the same.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.169
FRALEY:
Professor Eppes!

12:16.203 --> 12:18.171
Please wait.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.840
What is it, Agent Fraley?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.042
I was wondering if you were
aware that your colleague,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.511
Phil Sanjrani, recently
traveled to the Bajaur region

12:24.544 --> 12:27.147
of Pakistan,
the new home of al-Qaeda.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.417
And that when he attended
a Pakistani university,

12:30.450 --> 12:32.519
his roommate was a man

12:32.552 --> 12:34.955
who later became
a member of al-Qaeda.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.425
Your sister's a pharmacist.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.129
Oh, I thought you'd
make this argument,

12:42.162 --> 12:43.897
so I Googled you.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.533
She studied pre-pharmacy
at the University of Maryland.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.869
Her Organic Chemistry professor

12:48.902 --> 12:51.404
was Dr. Afzul Abbas.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.541
Dr. Abbas studied
at Cairo University.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.877
While there, he lived
in the same residence

12:56.910 --> 12:58.411
as Ayman al-Zawahiri,

12:58.445 --> 13:00.914
a qualified pharmacologist,
surgeon,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.316
prominent leader of al-Qaeda.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.820
I connected you
to a dangerous terrorist

13:06.854 --> 13:09.990
in three links.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.893
I, uh, appreciate
your skills

13:12.926 --> 13:14.494
in logic and deduction.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.097
I hope you can
appreciate my experience

13:17.130 --> 13:19.366
working in counterterrorism.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.985
So you got your
search warrant. Good.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.452
Maybe now we can

13:39.486 --> 13:41.154
- resolve this whole thing.
- This gives us

13:41.188 --> 13:43.623
the right to seize all PIF
records and information.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.458
Oh, I doubt there's
much more than what

13:45.492 --> 13:48.628
the FBI has already obtained
through its wiretaps

13:48.661 --> 13:49.262
and other

13:49.296 --> 13:51.264
electronic surveillances.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.166
Care to tell us
how you're aware of that?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.469
We are Pakistani Muslims.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.938
You are FBI.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.880
ASHA:
The PIF money helped

14:06.914 --> 14:08.415
many groups in Pakistan.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.352
We got letters from school
children thanking us.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.588
A group of us went
out there last year

14:15.622 --> 14:17.290
to set up a health center.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.627
Did your husband have any

14:20.660 --> 14:22.629
problems with the PIF's
fundraising?

14:22.662 --> 14:24.364
He and Ronald Jamali

14:24.397 --> 14:26.099
were upset about something.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.135
- He didn't say what.
- Did he have any confrontations

14:28.168 --> 14:29.036
with the other members?

14:29.069 --> 14:32.372
He did call people
in Karachi about it.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.508
Mazari's name was mentioned.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.510
I, I don't know for sure.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.414
Thank you for your help.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.183
The man who abducted my husband,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.485
I heard his voice.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.187
He wasn't Pakistani.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.422
But you didn't see his face.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.460
My son plays baseball.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.362
My daughter

14:55.395 --> 14:57.931
goes to the mall.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.167
This is the only country
they know.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.568
And when they

15:01.601 --> 15:03.170
lose their father,

15:03.203 --> 15:05.338
this country tells them
he was a terrorist.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.677
- Hey.
- Hey!

15:10.710 --> 15:13.446
I've just been arguing with
an FBI counterterrorism expert.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.581
What're you guys up to?

15:14.614 --> 15:17.150
Oh, we just got back from
talking to Dr. Baltimore,

15:17.184 --> 15:18.151
who runs the
microbiology labs.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.953
Yeah, we just thought
it might be interesting

15:19.987 --> 15:22.322
to get his opinion
of Phil Sanjrani's work.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.124
Oh, yeah.
What did he say?

15:24.157 --> 15:27.560
He says it looks like it is
what Sanjrani said it was.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.230
Engineered gene sequencing
for the development

15:30.263 --> 15:31.631
of disease-resistant crops.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.167
He did concede
that some of it,

15:34.201 --> 15:36.236
conceivably, could be used
to create pathogens.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.704
But only if you
look at all the data

15:37.737 --> 15:41.574
through the "myopic lens
of a paranoid federal official."

15:41.608 --> 15:42.575
His words, not mine.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.581
MEGAN:
Hey, Don.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.550
So I know Fraley's just
doing his job, but...

15:50.583 --> 15:52.119
You're on Charlie's side?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.221
Oh, come on.
I'm not on a "side."

15:54.254 --> 15:56.456
Fraley's expertise
is terrorism.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.592
Look, I know we often have to
act on minimal information.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.827
- Exactly.
- But if we go

16:00.860 --> 16:03.463
too far, we're going to destroy
what we're trying to defend.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.099
"He who gives up freedom
for safety deserves neither."

16:06.133 --> 16:08.168
- Benjamin Franklin?
- No, actually,

16:08.201 --> 16:09.669
I think it's
a bumper sticker I saw.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.870
Six months ago,
this group started

16:10.903 --> 16:13.473
to raise a lot more money,
stopped keeping good records.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.342
Probably a reason.
I got a bunch

16:15.375 --> 16:17.010
of weird phone calls
to New York

16:17.044 --> 16:19.046
and Boston and San Francisco.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.347
Fine, go for it,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.549
but I say all roads
lead to Pakistan.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.619
(door opens)

16:26.653 --> 16:28.188
Hey!

16:28.221 --> 16:29.189
Hi, Donnie.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.357
Who's winning?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.391
I don't know,

16:31.424 --> 16:33.193
I'm reading the paper.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.794
Hey, Charlie, you buy
what Fraley says?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.530
I don't know, he's wrong
about Phil Sanjrani, so...

16:37.564 --> 16:38.598
ALAN:
Professor Sanjrani?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.533
Why, he's involved
in an FBI case?

16:40.567 --> 16:43.136
I thought you were
reading the paper there.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.705
Yeah, well, I was,
but it's too depressing.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.708
Look, Charlie,
you know, I mean,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.043
you've got to be objective here.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.411
I'm the one being objective.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.480
You've arrested
a man for sharing

16:53.513 --> 16:54.547
scientific knowledge.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.150
It's dangerous information
with foreign extremists.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.519
Hope you told them
to make it extra crispy.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.687
- Dad...
- You don't know that.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.056
That's the way it looks.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.524
I'm having a piece,
you want one? Anybody?

17:07.427 --> 17:08.728
You know, you and I have

17:08.761 --> 17:10.130
two very different worldviews,

17:10.163 --> 17:11.564
and that's fine.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.333
But now you're crossing
into my world

17:13.366 --> 17:15.168
and making assumptions
about how people

17:15.202 --> 17:17.570
like me can or should work.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.471
Charlie, people in your world

17:18.505 --> 17:20.640
also happen to make
dangerous things.

17:21.774 --> 17:22.675
Ah, here we go.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.477
You know, sooner or later,
this fight was

17:24.511 --> 17:25.345
bound to happen.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.079
You don't understand the
specifics here.

17:26.113 --> 17:26.779
Well, I don't
really have to.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.281
Besides, there's nothing wrong

17:28.315 --> 17:29.282
with an honest disagreement.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.450
It's more than a
disagreement.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.718
Call it what you want.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.153
This pizza is really, very good.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.721
They finally
made it crispy.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.256
Now, look, you both have
very strong principles.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.358
But you can't always
see things the same way.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.792
Now, I'm going
to have my pizza,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.628
and I'm going
to watch the game.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.696
And I hope you guys
will decide to join me.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.678
Local informants
haven't heard anything

17:58.711 --> 18:00.813
about anyone buying
Russian rocket launchers,

18:00.847 --> 18:03.583
but there's somebody out
there trying to sell RPGs.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.252
- Sell them?
- Do we know who?

18:05.285 --> 18:06.619
We're working on it.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.488
Hey, so I've come
upon some significance

18:08.521 --> 18:09.789
in the PIF analysis.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.191
You found
a hidden operative?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.359
It's possible.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.660
But whatever
this person's doing,

18:13.693 --> 18:16.129
he's covertly linked
to Rafiq and Jamali.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.164
Are you sure?

18:17.197 --> 18:19.266
98.2% sure.
I've got the data.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.368
So, using the Byzantine
agreements

18:21.401 --> 18:22.769
in secure
communication model,

18:22.802 --> 18:26.173
the NSA data on the
PIF's member cell phone use

18:26.206 --> 18:27.840
pointed out
a third member

18:27.874 --> 18:29.742
who had a pattern
of contact

18:29.776 --> 18:32.379
with the two victims
before they were abducted.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.481
So was this person
trying to root out

18:34.514 --> 18:36.183
Jamali and Rafiq
as traitors?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.185
Uh, no. Actually,
the analysis

18:38.218 --> 18:40.453
described a very
curious player,

18:40.487 --> 18:43.690
traversing the network
to uncover information,

18:43.723 --> 18:45.892
but in collaboration

18:45.925 --> 18:47.594
with Rafiq and Jamali,

18:47.627 --> 18:50.563
and his name
is Benjamin Rajar.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.166
Sinclair. I need a surveillance
team for one Benjamin Rajar.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.236
Driver's license F549N649.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.405
He's a lawyer

18:58.438 --> 19:00.507
with DVY Associates,
626 Wilshire.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.641
Downtown.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.477
If you were able to connect this
guy to the two dead men,

19:04.511 --> 19:05.612
I'm betting the terrorists
will, as well.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.352
(garbled radio transmission)

19:14.854 --> 19:17.224
DAVID: Jamali was abducted off a
busy street.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.591
All right,
that's one hell of a risk.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.863
If they're well-trained,
they'll like all the movement.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.232
It's easy to peel

19:25.265 --> 19:26.566
one person out of the crowd

19:26.599 --> 19:27.634
without attracting attention.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.836
AGENT (over radio):
B-Team One, target's moving.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.271
Prepare to exit.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.806
Alpha Team, are you in position?

19:33.840 --> 19:34.707
All right, we got him.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.616
Wh-Where is he?
Who's got him?

19:43.650 --> 19:44.917
Anyone got eyes on him?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.018
AGENT (over radio):
A-Team Three,

19:46.052 --> 19:47.987
he's at the southeast corner
of Wilshire and Hope.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.755
There.

19:52.959 --> 19:53.726
Someone's grabbing him!
We're going in!

19:55.595 --> 19:57.364
FBI!

19:58.598 --> 19:59.131
(gunshot)

19:59.165 --> 20:01.601
(bystanders screaming)

20:03.870 --> 20:05.805
(tires screeching)

20:07.907 --> 20:09.842
FBI! Get those hands up
where I can see them!

20:12.912 --> 20:13.813
Hey!

20:14.981 --> 20:16.583
Get them up!

20:16.616 --> 20:17.784
(rapid gunfire)

20:24.891 --> 20:25.958
(glass shattering)

20:25.992 --> 20:27.994
DISPATCH: We've got gunshots,
multiple gunshots...

20:28.027 --> 20:29.596
Automatic weapon fire.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.431
(horn honking)

20:51.318 --> 20:52.952
I'm going after David.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.588
Get out of the way!

20:55.622 --> 20:57.924
Hey! Hey, stop!

21:03.863 --> 21:05.264
(bystanders clamoring)

21:10.069 --> 21:11.037
DON:
You all right?!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.539
I'm okay.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.840
It's all right.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.708
We lost the other guy.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.910
And this one is dead.

21:17.944 --> 21:18.778
Who is that?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.947
DAVID:
I don't know.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.814
Doesn't look like a Pakistani.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.560
MEGAN: So if this is a Pakistani
extremist,

21:33.593 --> 21:35.395
I'm a Japanese
schoolgirl.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.863
They've recruited
domestic operatives,

21:36.896 --> 21:38.731
making them more capable
and dangerous.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.400
MEGAN: That's
the only explanation?

21:40.433 --> 21:42.535
We shouldn't be looking
at other possibilities?

21:42.569 --> 21:44.003
Put it together
with what we know--

21:44.036 --> 21:46.539
two murders and another attempt,

21:46.573 --> 21:48.741
the weapons,
the school plans.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.843
The PIF phone records
have calls to New York,

21:50.877 --> 21:52.812
Boston and San Francisco--

21:52.845 --> 21:54.447
none connect
to Islamic causes.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.748
We have to penetrate this group,

21:55.782 --> 21:57.784
find out who's calling
the shots.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.386
If we can't, what, then?

21:59.419 --> 22:02.955
Get a judge to issue arrest
orders for as many members

22:02.989 --> 22:05.558
as we can, initiate
deportation proceedings.

22:05.592 --> 22:06.826
Hit them with everything we got.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.361
That's just going to ruin

22:08.395 --> 22:09.962
a lot of innocent
people's lives.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.698
So could a rocket attack
on a school.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.468
So why do you think
somebody tried to kill you?

22:15.502 --> 22:16.536
I have no idea.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.805
I was kind of hoping
you guys are on top of that.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.475
Well, two days
before he was killed,

22:22.509 --> 22:25.412
Kaleem Rafiq called
your law office.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.780
Yes, he wanted me to look over
the PIF's financials.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.816
He said the group donated
to certain charities.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.019
Some of them had called to ask
why the money had stopped.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.722
Okay. Who's in charge
of the PIF's funds?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.990
Supposed to be a committee,
but in recent months,

22:38.024 --> 22:40.393
it's been...

22:40.427 --> 22:42.595
It's been who?

22:42.629 --> 22:44.030
I don't want to
give you any names,

22:44.063 --> 22:46.733
not with the way the FBI's
been handling this.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.669
Innocent people are being
accused of terrible stuff.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.671
To fix that, we need more
information, not less.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.076
All right.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.914
Hamad Mazari's been handling
the funds.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.417
Has anybody talked
to Mazari about this?

23:04.451 --> 23:06.753
Rafiq said he and Jamali did.

23:06.786 --> 23:07.787
How'd they say he responded?

23:07.820 --> 23:08.988
Mazari said he was working

23:09.021 --> 23:10.523
with new charities.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.659
Kaleem called Pakistan
to look into them,

23:12.692 --> 23:14.527
but nobody had ever heard
of them.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.497
Didn't anybody suspect Mazari
of mishandling the funds?

23:17.530 --> 23:20.500
We figured it was just a mix-up,

23:20.533 --> 23:21.934
and then
the murders happened.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.671
Everybody's too upset to worry
about the money right now.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.439
Okay.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.508
What do you know about these?

23:33.045 --> 23:35.181
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.819
LARRY: It's hard to believe this
city started out

23:39.852 --> 23:42.054
as this tiny, little
Spanish settlement,

23:42.088 --> 23:45.024
supporting a mission
in San Gabriel.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.959
I wonder if there are
any angels left

23:46.993 --> 23:48.628
in the City of Angels.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.963
Oh, a few,
I'd like to think.

23:50.997 --> 23:54.734
And I sense we're
about to lose one.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.036
Am I making a mistake?

23:57.069 --> 24:00.507
Well, you're answering something

24:00.540 --> 24:02.742
that's been calling out
to you for...

24:02.775 --> 24:04.644
some time now.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.812
How can that be a mistake?

24:15.755 --> 24:19.025
Phil, how are you doing?

24:19.058 --> 24:21.961
They questioned me for 30 hours.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.663
They told me
I had a visitor,

24:23.696 --> 24:25.932
I thought it was
finally a lawyer.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.200
Well, do you have
an attorney?

24:28.234 --> 24:30.036
It doesn't matter.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.238
They've made up their minds
about me.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.807
They said that when you were
in college,

24:34.841 --> 24:37.076
you had a roommate who's
now a member of al-Qaeda.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.746
That's a mistake.

24:39.779 --> 24:43.149
He has the same name
as a member of al-Qaeda.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.717
He's been trying for years

24:44.751 --> 24:46.085
to get that confusion
cleared up.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.521
And then last year,
you visited Pakistan...

24:48.555 --> 24:49.856
To visit family,

24:49.889 --> 24:51.524
meet with the researchers
that I work with.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.925
The feds make it sound like

24:52.959 --> 24:55.261
I went to a jihadist
training camp.

24:55.294 --> 24:58.164
What do you think is
going on in the PIF?

24:58.197 --> 25:00.232
Why were these two men killed?

25:00.266 --> 25:02.034
I have no idea.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.305
Are you asking for the FBI,
or for yourself?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.640
For myself.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.877
I know your work;
I know its value.

25:10.910 --> 25:14.113
They got some FBI scientist
to review my work

25:14.146 --> 25:16.082
and say it's applicable
to human pathogens.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.986
I'll find that report,
then I'll review it.

25:21.821 --> 25:25.091
The hardest part for me is,
I was only able to send

25:25.124 --> 25:27.126
part of my work
before I was arrested.

25:27.159 --> 25:31.030
My work could save tens
of thousands from starvation,

25:31.063 --> 25:32.298
but now, it'll do nothing.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.203
Phil, I am trying...

25:37.236 --> 25:40.539
I'm trying to get the FBI
to reconsider your case.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.778
I doubt that's possible.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.784
But I would appreciate it
if you could talk to my wife...

25:52.852 --> 25:54.921
...my parents.

25:54.954 --> 25:59.592
Tell them...
I am not what they say I am.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.063
Hey, Don.

26:04.096 --> 26:07.133
Hey. Who's this guy with all the
orange? I don't remember him.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.267
CHARLIE:
That one?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.336
That's Tombrello. He's an old
fish. He likes to hide

26:10.369 --> 26:12.304
- a lot.
- Yeah?

26:12.338 --> 26:15.174
I went over the FBI analysis
of Phil Sanjrani's work.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.109
The findings aren't
scientifically valid.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.679
All right. Well, so what is
that supposed to mean?

26:19.712 --> 26:21.180
For one,
it's a political document.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.749
It's not even a scientific one.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.183
Charlie, no matter
how you cut it,

26:24.216 --> 26:25.417
the guy shouldn't have sent
his stuff to Pakistan.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.888
Insects and crop disease are
serious problems in Pakistan.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.191
His work's going to help farmers
feed starving people.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.627
I don't think we should horde

26:34.661 --> 26:37.196
that kind of knowledge. I don't
think we have the right to.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.899
Well, we have a right to protect
our country, don't we?

26:39.932 --> 26:42.034
On any given day, you know,
I'm in contact with scientists

26:42.068 --> 26:43.736
in Moscow

26:43.770 --> 26:45.037
and China and India.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.139
Are you going
to arrest me?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.111
COLBY:
So we've got nothing

26:52.144 --> 26:54.914
on the dead guy shot trying
to abduct the attorney.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.916
You're looking
at domestic lists, right?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.951
You don't think
he's American?

26:58.985 --> 27:01.220
I've been tracking down
a lot of calls

27:01.253 --> 27:04.056
between
the PIF and U.S. cities.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.226
And... I know this is
going to sound really weird,

27:07.259 --> 27:09.896
but a lot of them lead
to people and groups

27:09.929 --> 27:13.032
that are linked
to the Irish Republican Army.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.967
The IRA is defunct.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.903
MEGAN: But when it was
active in the U.S.,

27:16.936 --> 27:19.672
it was a network that raised
money and smuggled guns.

27:19.706 --> 27:23.009
So are you saying you've found
the last active IRA cell?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.343
I'm not saying
it's an active cell.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.245
But what happened
to all those operatives?

27:26.278 --> 27:27.079
What are they doing?

27:27.113 --> 27:28.848
They're all working
at Starbucks?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.850
All right. Well,
I mean, we could talk

27:30.883 --> 27:32.752
to old, uh,
ex-IRA contacts.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.754
I could look
at the PIF leadership.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.288
I just got some phone records

27:36.322 --> 27:39.391
that might give me
something on Mazari.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.460
You got anything else
maybe, uh, you know,

27:41.493 --> 27:43.262
you want to talk
to us about?

27:43.295 --> 27:45.097
COLBY: Yeah, maybe it has
something to do

27:45.131 --> 27:47.399
with your little trip
to DC that none of us

27:47.433 --> 27:48.634
were supposed to
know anything about?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.903
Yeah, 'cause we're thinking
you're up for a big promotion.

27:50.937 --> 27:54.006
Maybe a job at Quantico,
could be... maybe...?

27:54.040 --> 27:58.210
Or maybe I'm just going
to leave the Bureau...

27:58.244 --> 28:01.147
and counsel women in prison,

28:01.180 --> 28:02.214
and finish my doctorate.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.450
Oh.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.120
That's a pretty big
career change.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.156
You know, I love working
with you guys.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.291
But I feel like it's become
very clear this year

28:12.324 --> 28:14.961
that I'm not going to
make it here as a lifer.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.329
Did you, uh...
you talk to Don?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.298
He knows already.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.272
CHARLIE:
The FBI is wrong.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.041
I don't think I can keep
working on this case.

28:29.075 --> 28:32.779
They're working from a theory
different from yours, true.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.346
But that doesn't make
either of you wrong.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.016
You don't know what's going on
with the PIF either,

28:37.049 --> 28:38.184
but something is.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.987
You're not
serving the FBI here;

28:41.020 --> 28:42.922
you're serving the truth.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.227
(sports broadcast plays on TV)

28:58.370 --> 29:00.239
Max Flaherty.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.842
(Irish accent): What could two
feds possibly want with me?

29:02.875 --> 29:05.077
We heard some of your
old cohorts might be

29:05.111 --> 29:06.245
back in business.

29:06.278 --> 29:07.546
I don't have cohorts.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.248
Try Sullivan's on 6th.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.083
As a former
convicted member

29:11.117 --> 29:12.518
of the IRA, if the FBI

29:12.551 --> 29:14.453
considers you
uncooperative,

29:14.486 --> 29:16.455
it would be very easy
to have you deported.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.891
What do you want to know?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.192
Illegal weapons.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.128
Any of your old associates
working the markets?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.096
Some of the boys still in it,
I've heard.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.398
New York, Boston. Not here.

29:26.432 --> 29:30.202
Do you know this man?

29:30.236 --> 29:31.804
Yeah, John Austin.

29:31.838 --> 29:32.939
Dead, is he?

29:32.972 --> 29:36.208
Killed by federal agents
during an attempted abduction.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.077
What an end.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.080
But then, he was never
headed for a good one.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.248
What was he doing
in Los Angeles?

29:42.281 --> 29:44.283
Don't know. He didn't
come around here.

29:44.316 --> 29:47.820
He ran with a fellow who wasn't
liked in Los Angeles--

29:47.854 --> 29:49.321
one Shane O'Hanahan.

29:49.355 --> 29:52.091
Why wasn't O'Hanahan liked?

29:52.124 --> 29:53.960
He was a nasty piece of work.

29:53.993 --> 29:57.029
Ireland be damned, he was only
in it for the money and guns.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.464
Would O'Hananan
find himself

29:58.497 --> 30:00.366
mixed up with Pakistani
militants

30:00.399 --> 30:02.334
who want to attack
the U.S.?

30:02.368 --> 30:05.604
When he was IRA,
he worked with Libyans, Syrians.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.606
Hell, Shane O'Hanahan would work
with the Devil himself

30:07.639 --> 30:10.109
if he thought he could get
a dollar out of it.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.578
Thank you.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.418
Thanks.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.587
Mr. Mazari?

30:21.620 --> 30:25.291
Hamad Mazari?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.359
Yes. How can I help you?

30:28.995 --> 30:32.865
Same social security number,
same identity documents.

30:32.899 --> 30:36.302
So the man we know as Mazari
stole his identity.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.604
Our guy could be Saudi
or Syrian.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.472
Who the hell knows?
Could be al-Qaeda.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.441
We ID'd the man killed
in the shootout.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.477
His name is John Austin,
IRA, out of Belfast.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.346
One of Austin's partners--
known gunrunner,

30:47.379 --> 30:49.148
Shane O'Hanahan.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.250
Actually, that might fit
your call thing, right?

30:51.283 --> 30:52.384
- What was it,
- New York...?

30:52.418 --> 30:53.252
- Boston...
- San Francisco.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.521
- Uh-huh.
- Definitely IRA centers.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.522
Started six months ago.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.557
DAVID: And Mazari joined
the PIF six months ago,

30:58.590 --> 31:01.160
and that's when the group
changed how it disperses funds.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.396
So these ex-IRA guys are
supplying the PIF's weapons.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.298
All right. So we got
to find this Mazari.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.367
I checked his office;
it was cleaned up.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.002
But I have a residential
address for him.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.913
FBI!

31:26.452 --> 31:27.319
Clear.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.354
Clear.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.255
Clear.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.659
He's gone.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.427
COLBY: You guys, come around to
the garage.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.363
(garage door whirring)

31:39.465 --> 31:41.433
Whoa!

31:41.467 --> 31:43.235
Damn.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.640
COLBY: It looks like this guy
grabbed

31:48.674 --> 31:52.444
everything he could carry
and got the hell out of here.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.480
Only he's in Los Angeles
somewhere,

31:54.513 --> 31:56.015
with enough
firepower

31:56.048 --> 31:57.383
to make one hell
of a mess.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.258
We don't know the identity
of the man we're after.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.060
We do know he's an extremist,

32:08.094 --> 32:10.096
he's got rocket
launchers,

32:10.129 --> 32:13.432
he's linked to plans
for an attack on area schools.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.368
I've run an analysis

32:16.402 --> 32:17.569
on our so-called

32:17.603 --> 32:20.072
Mazari as a known
covert operator.

32:20.106 --> 32:23.209
He is not the center
of a terror group,

32:23.242 --> 32:25.111
he has been working alone.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.278
All patterns show

32:26.312 --> 32:28.180
- isolated activity.
- FRALEY: Well,

32:28.214 --> 32:29.681
yeah, he killed

32:29.715 --> 32:31.417
- his coconspirators.
- Uh, no.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.086
My analysis shows
that he's always been isolated

32:34.120 --> 32:35.521
within this group.
Remember the analogy

32:35.554 --> 32:37.256
where we thought that

32:37.289 --> 32:39.091
Rafiq and Jamali were
the oarsmen working

32:39.125 --> 32:41.093
- against the rest of the team?
- Yeah, all right.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.361
It was Mazari
hijacking the boat.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.296
FRALEY: We don't have a
terrorist cell.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.132
We've got a lone terrorist?

32:46.165 --> 32:48.000
Are you a hundred
percent positive

32:48.034 --> 32:49.001
that Mazari's
a terrorist?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.136
How else to explain the weapons,

32:50.169 --> 32:51.303
the plans for attacks

32:51.337 --> 32:52.438
on schools?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.606
DON: Well, to be fair, we really
got blueprints, right?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.275
They weren't
attack plans.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.309
We're looking
at Angels and Devils.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.145
Excuse me?

32:59.178 --> 33:01.180
M.C. Escher's print
of Angels and Devils,

33:01.213 --> 33:02.381
is a classic example

33:02.414 --> 33:04.116
of the figure-ground

33:04.150 --> 33:05.617
effect in perceptual
organization.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.619
How we look at things
is determined

33:07.653 --> 33:09.055
by our predisposition.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.689
In Escher's
Angels and Devils,

33:10.722 --> 33:13.225
one can either see black devils
or white angels.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.261
Our perception is influenced

33:15.294 --> 33:16.595
by our thinking.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.130
DAVID: We found
the school plans

33:18.164 --> 33:19.165
at Ronald Jamali's house.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.532
And his wife said
his construction

33:20.566 --> 33:22.334
company was gonna make
a bid on a school

33:22.368 --> 33:24.170
roofing project.
That'd explain

33:24.203 --> 33:25.204
why the blueprints
were there.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.305
And the firing pin

33:26.338 --> 33:28.440
we found at the murder scene

33:28.474 --> 33:30.676
could have been left there by
Mazari. So,

33:30.709 --> 33:32.711
no conspiracy,
no terrorist.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.480
Maybe something else
entirely?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.515
MEGAN:
You're not gonna believe this.

33:36.548 --> 33:39.051
I found photos
of Shane O'Hanahan,

33:39.085 --> 33:41.553
you know, the IRA associate
of John Austin.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.722
Check this out.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.292
Facial recognition
software identified them

33:46.325 --> 33:48.327
as the same person.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.363
Mazari's not...

33:51.397 --> 33:53.332
- Pakistani?
- DAVID: No,

33:53.365 --> 33:55.201
he's a former IRA gunrunner.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.702
MEGAN: He faked being Pakistani
to get

33:56.735 --> 33:58.237
the PIF's funds,

33:58.270 --> 34:00.439
which he used to finance
his old business

34:00.472 --> 34:02.308
- of selling black market arms.
- That's why

34:02.341 --> 34:04.610
we heard about weapons being
for sale in the area.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.778
He killed Rafiq and Jamali
because they got suspicious.

34:06.812 --> 34:07.779
DAVID:
Then he tried

34:07.813 --> 34:10.649
to grab Rajar,
and now he has to be on the run.

34:19.191 --> 34:22.794
LAPD has an all points.
And TSA's on alert at LAX, uh,

34:22.828 --> 34:25.297
Long Beach, Burbank, Ontario.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.266
DAVID:
We have undercover agents

34:27.299 --> 34:28.567
at Union Station
and the bus terminal.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.736
This guy's not taking
any obvious

34:30.769 --> 34:32.171
routes, people.

34:35.707 --> 34:36.675
COLBY:
We're checking banks

34:36.708 --> 34:38.110
and credit card companies

34:38.144 --> 34:39.845
for any activity
under O'Hanahan's aliases.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.284
FRALEY:
I've got the FAA

34:45.317 --> 34:47.253
monitoring all private
plane flight plans.

34:48.554 --> 34:52.224
Hi, I'd like to reserve a car,
please.

34:52.258 --> 34:55.127
Last name, Kerrigan.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.363
MEGAN: Hey, I just got a guy in
Burbank

34:57.396 --> 35:00.232
who used a credit
card to rent

35:00.266 --> 35:01.867
a rental car under the name
"Jackson Kerrigan,"

35:01.900 --> 35:03.269
one of O'Hanahan's aliases.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.460
Everyone's out

35:28.494 --> 35:30.296
- and we're clear, Don.
- Okay, we're going in.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.230
We're moving.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.434
Shane O'Hanahan.
FBI. Freeze!

35:35.467 --> 35:37.469
My name's Jack Kerrigan, boys.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.371
Put the bag down.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.473
Just relax, okay?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.209
It's going down.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.489
CHARLIE:
Just a classic logic error.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.358
You make the evidence
fit your theory,

35:59.391 --> 36:01.393
not the other way around.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.229
COLBY: The PIF was
Pakistani Muslims,

36:03.262 --> 36:05.264
so we assumed a terrorist cell.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.473
So, uh...

36:14.506 --> 36:17.476
why is Phil Sanjrani
still in custody?

36:17.509 --> 36:18.977
What do you mean?

36:19.010 --> 36:21.513
He-he e-mailed restricted
documents overseas.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.582
But we-we now know that
there was no terrorist action,

36:23.615 --> 36:24.916
so...

36:24.950 --> 36:26.518
He still broke federal law.

36:26.552 --> 36:27.853
Yeah, but you guys
only arrested him

36:27.886 --> 36:29.388
because he was a member
of the PIF, right?

36:29.421 --> 36:30.989
Doesn't matter;
he did what he did.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.391
Yeah, it matters.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.392
It matters.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.593
Your analysis
of his work

36:34.626 --> 36:37.263
rests on the assumption that
he's a terrorist. He's not.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.564
Can't you see

36:38.597 --> 36:40.399
that an objective
evaluation comes

36:40.432 --> 36:42.468
to an entirely different
conclusion he's innocent?

36:42.501 --> 36:45.871
Well, Charlie, I promise you,
he will get his day in court.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.847
You guys might
want to leave.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.518
I don't want you
to be accessories.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.354
We'll take the risk.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.457
Think I'm making a mistake?

37:05.491 --> 37:08.394
You need to do what
you believe is right.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.370
There. It's done.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.512
Megan resigned.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.013
Was it about
this case?

37:28.046 --> 37:30.482
No.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.651
I think it's been building up
for some time.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.586
She's moving

37:34.620 --> 37:36.555
to Washington,
going back to school,

37:36.588 --> 37:40.025
looking for a line of work
closer to her heart.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.593
You okay?

37:43.729 --> 37:49.501
You know, last year I was
217 miles above the Earth.

37:49.535 --> 37:50.836
(sighs)

37:50.869 --> 37:53.004
Yeah, our relationship
has never depended

37:53.038 --> 37:56.608
on geographic proximity.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.778
* A warning sign

37:59.811 --> 38:04.616
* I missed the good part,
then I realized... *

38:04.650 --> 38:07.319
So, it looks like
you're all packed up.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.321
Uh, yeah, I'm ready.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.789
You want some help
with this stuff?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.692
Yes, please.
Thank you.

38:13.725 --> 38:19.565
* I started looking
for excuses *

38:23.669 --> 38:26.071
* Come on in...

38:26.104 --> 38:28.507
Well, let's go.
before I get silly.

38:28.540 --> 38:34.480
* I've got to tell you what a
state I'm in *

38:34.513 --> 38:38.750
* I've got to tell you in my
loudest tone... *

38:38.784 --> 38:40.018
Dr. Eppes, you ready?

38:40.051 --> 38:41.553
Hey, Dad, your car needs a bath.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.656
CHARLIE:
So...

38:44.690 --> 38:46.558
this is my attorney,

38:46.592 --> 38:49.995
and he's negotiated my surrender
to federal authorities.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.063
AGENT: Dr. Eppes, I'll need to
handcuff you.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.633
DON:
Ah, Charlie.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.535
- What did you do?
- I e-mailed

38:56.568 --> 38:59.671
the rest of
Sanjrani's work

38:59.705 --> 39:02.941
to scientists at four
universities in Pakistan.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.476
Why?

39:04.510 --> 39:06.478
I felt I had to.

39:06.512 --> 39:07.779
As Phil's colleague...

39:09.448 --> 39:11.550
...as a scientist.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.752
* And I realized

39:13.785 --> 39:15.921
CHARLIE:
I have a strong defense.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.757
That research can't
be used as a weapon.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.925
We know that now.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.092
We couldn't
know it then.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.429
Is this true,
what I just heard?

39:23.462 --> 39:24.730
You lost your
security clearance?

39:24.763 --> 39:26.632
Yeah, it's true.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.166
Do something, fix this.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.101
- It doesn't work that way.
- You know what this means?

39:30.135 --> 39:31.703
That he cannot work

39:31.737 --> 39:33.605
at this college
on any classified project.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.774
And second, how can
you even... keep working

39:35.807 --> 39:37.643
for the FBI
without your clearance?

39:37.676 --> 39:39.411
I don't think I can.

39:39.445 --> 39:40.345
* I'll miss you...

39:40.378 --> 39:43.682
Neither one of you want
to talk about it?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.484
Well, it's a hell
of a big elephant

39:45.517 --> 39:46.552
in a relatively small yard.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.592
Right.
(clears throat)

39:53.625 --> 39:54.926
It's kind of amazing

39:54.960 --> 39:56.995
that we worked together
as long as we did.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.534
You know, this is not
the first time that

40:02.568 --> 40:04.670
this house has been divided
by a fundamental disagreement.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.138
That year that Charlie spent

40:07.172 --> 40:08.540
at MIT, remember
when he came home?

40:08.574 --> 40:10.542
Now, that was a shocker.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.543
Yeah.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.612
So I'm a Celtics fan.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.615
It happens,
even in good families.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.049
Actually, not really.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.019
Not in L.A.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.822
(chuckles)

40:23.855 --> 40:27.459
(phone rings)

40:27.493 --> 40:29.895
DON:
Eppes.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.963
Okay, I'm on my way.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.034
All right.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.871
See you guys later, huh?

40:42.007 --> 40:43.709
Don.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.813
Just watch yourself.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.481
You, too.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.986
* When the truth hits

40:59.891 --> 41:01.493
* I'll miss you

41:01.527 --> 41:04.563
This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

41:04.596 --> 41:08.634
I think it's...
to be continued.

41:13.271 --> 41:16.608
* That I'll miss you...
