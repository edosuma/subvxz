00:05.755 --> 00:08.882
Welcome, everybody.
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.593
Oh, oh! It's on again.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.638
- Guys, could we please not watch this?
- Shh.

00:14.806 --> 00:18.183
Folks, this ever happen to you?
You go to get a nice glass of milk...

00:18.351 --> 00:21.645
...but these darn cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.772
Boy, you said it, Mike.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.108
Aw. Aw.

00:26.359 --> 00:30.029
- There's gotta be a better way.
- And there is, Kevin.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.449
- Can we please turn this off?
- No way, Kevin.

00:33.658 --> 00:37.369
What if I told you
there's a new product that guarantees...

00:37.537 --> 00:40.497
...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?

00:40.665 --> 00:42.916
Meet the Milkmaster 2000.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.501
Ooh.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.796
- Intrigued?
- You're flinging, flanging right I am.

00:49.549 --> 00:54.053
This is his first time. He's never used this.
You're gonna see how easy this is to do.

00:54.929 --> 00:58.015
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy. Ha, ha.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.601
Now I can have milk every day.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.019
Ah.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.240
It's official. There are no good movies.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.992
So let's go to a bad one and make out.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.580
Ew.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.085
Perhaps you would like me to turn like this
so you can bunny-bump against my back?

02:09.878 --> 02:10.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.924
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Maybe you can tell me.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.886
My agent would like to know
why I didn't show up at my audition today...

02:18.054 --> 02:21.932
...the first good thing she gets me in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?

02:22.100 --> 02:24.518
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...

02:25.061 --> 02:26.812
...but it wasn't me.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.939
Yes, it was. It was him. Uh-huh.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.234
Okay, it was me.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.739
- How was it you?
- Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.993
Chandler was in the closet
counting to 10 and was up to seven...

02:41.161 --> 02:43.162
...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.

02:44.497 --> 02:48.959
Look, I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.253
- Yep, that's my audition.
- Yeah.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.423
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.509
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.097
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.

03:02.348 --> 03:06.393
Well, Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.811
Well, that is unfair.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.647
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was totally my fault.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.775
You can't.
The casting director doesn't talk to friends.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.279
- She only talks to agents.
- What a sad little life she must lead.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.782
Okay. Ooh.

03:20.950 --> 03:24.578
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- No, I know, I know. Ooh.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.332
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.

03:28.499 --> 03:32.252
Um, is, um, Anne there for Phoebe?

03:32.420 --> 03:34.755
She'll know what it's about.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.882
Hang up. Hang up right...

03:38.384 --> 03:41.970
Annie? Hi. Listen,
we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.682
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?

03:45.975 --> 03:48.268
Estelle? I don't know
what I'm gonna do with her.

03:48.436 --> 03:52.648
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world does not stop.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.400
Is anybody else scared?

03:56.986 --> 04:00.906
If Joey loses this audition,
then that is it for Estelle. I don't care.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.576
Annie, you are a doll.
What time can you see him?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.870
I need a pen. Pen.

04:12.669 --> 04:16.588
Get the woman a pad.
Get the woman a pad. A pad! A pad!

04:16.755 --> 04:19.423
Oh, now you want a pad.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.054
- Hey.
- Hello.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.223
Where's my boy?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.517
Here's my boy.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.479
And here's his Barbie.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.778
What's, uh...?
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.532
He picked it out at the toy store himself.
He loves it.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.368
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.579
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.207
Yeah, it's cute.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.377
Why does he have it again?

04:55.586 --> 04:58.547
So he's got a doll. So what?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.926
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...

05:03.094 --> 05:04.720
...in show business.

05:05.388 --> 05:09.057
This wouldn't have to do with the fact
that he's being raised by two women?

05:11.102 --> 05:16.064
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.526
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie. Okay, how about...?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.070
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.407
No? Okay.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.327
Ooh, ooh. How about a Dino-Soldier?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.500
You are so pathetic.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.129
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.095
I gotta go to work.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.474
Has anybody seen my left boob?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.102
I loved that movie.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.275
Here it is. Joey, what are you doing?

06:01.069 --> 06:03.153
I'm sorry. It just felt nice.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.533
Joe. Joe. Answer the phone.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.287
I only got one arm. You should do stuff
for me. Get me a sweater.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.457
Just do it. It's Janice.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.626
And if I get it,
I'm gonna have to see her tonight.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.672
Oh, that's great.
I'm gonna have to see her tonight.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.133
Why don't you wanna see Janice?

06:25.301 --> 06:27.552
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...

06:27.720 --> 06:32.474
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.520
And that's bad...

06:36.687 --> 06:38.980
...because you hate chicken piccata?

06:39.649 --> 06:40.816
No.

06:40.983 --> 06:45.362
You didn't wanna share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.489
All of a sudden, we were this couple.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.325
And this alarm started going off
in my head.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.661
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"

06:53.663 --> 06:55.914
Ugh. Men are unbelievable.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.707
What is it with you people?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.919
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.338
I know. That...

07:04.674 --> 07:09.136
That's why I don't wanna go tonight.
I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.180
Oh. You mean that guy thing
where you act mean and distant...

07:12.348 --> 07:14.558
...until you get us to break up with you?
Mm-hm.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.934
Hey, you know about that?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.521
What do I do? I wanna get past this.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.023
I don't wanna be afraid
of the commitment thing.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.694
I wanna go through the tunnel
to the other side.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.948
- Where there's no fear of commitment.
- Ah.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.075
Do we have any...?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.914
Do we have any thoughts here?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.500
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...

07:40.668 --> 07:43.336
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.629
Hmm.

07:46.883 --> 07:51.178
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.389
You have a fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.558
You're afraid of bugs.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.435
Get a bug.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.062
Right?

08:01.230 --> 08:02.981
You have a fear of commitment.

08:03.232 --> 08:07.694
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.113
Amazingly, that makes sense.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.075
- Do you think?
- Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.410
Jump off the high dive.

08:15.578 --> 08:19.247
Stare down the barrel of the gun.
Pee into the wind.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.460
Joe, if I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...

08:23.628 --> 08:26.713
...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing
every which way.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.595
Ooh, it's your audition
from this morning.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.804
- Ooh.
- Oh.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.014
Can I use the phone?

08:36.182 --> 08:39.808
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and, uh, pretend agents.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.813
Come on, baby. Come on.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.443
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.197
Okay, well, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.032
Very nice touch.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.660
Okay, go ahead.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.372
- Talk, talk, talk.
- Oh, oh. Um... Ahem.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.332
Hi, Annie?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.833
Fantastic.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.336
- You got it.
- Oh! You got it.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.297
Um, will he work for scale, you ask me?

09:09.465 --> 09:10.674
Well, I don't know about that.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.468
- Ahem.
- Except that I do and he will.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.555
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.140
I would love to have lunch with you.

09:19.308 --> 09:22.143
How about we have lunch next...?

09:22.311 --> 09:24.396
Oop, went through a tunnel. Ha, ha.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.689
Unbelievable.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.899
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Ha, ha.

09:28.067 --> 09:32.696
It was really fun. I mean,
I've never talked on a car phone before.

09:32.863 --> 09:36.116
Oh. You are so amazing.
Could you do me this huge favor?

09:36.284 --> 09:39.786
There's this one other audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.497
Uh, I don't know.
It was fun one time, but...

09:42.665 --> 09:45.166
Come on, please?
It would just be this one more.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.835
Well, actually it's two.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.169
- Two?
- Yeah.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.879
Well, really it's three.

09:50.339 --> 09:54.092
Please? You're so good at it. I love you.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.761
Okay. But just these three, right?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.221
No, it's four.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.853
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.731
Because I wanted...

10:07.898 --> 10:09.524
...to give you this.

10:09.692 --> 10:14.446
Oh. Are you a puppy!

10:18.200 --> 10:19.576
Contact paper.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.039
You never know what to say
when someone you're sleeping with...

10:24.206 --> 10:25.957
...gives you contact paper. Ha, ha.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.920
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go...

10:31.088 --> 10:33.965
...in your brand-new drawer.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.386
See, the drawer actually goes
in my dresser.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.098
Oh. You didn't have to do this.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.767
Yes, I did.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.478
Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...

10:46.646 --> 10:50.065
...and that's what girlfriends should get.

10:50.691 --> 10:54.069
Oh. Well, I gotta buy a vowel...

10:55.738 --> 10:59.449
...because, oh, my God. Mwah.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.785
Who would've thought that someday...

11:01.994 --> 11:05.080
...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.458
Well, not me.

11:09.460 --> 11:13.463
But that's what's happened.
And, uh, there's more.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.424
We should take a trip.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.093
We should?

11:18.260 --> 11:21.096
Yup. We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.807
And I wanna meet your parents.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.810
We should take a trip with your parents.

11:30.940 --> 11:36.319
I don't think we need to,
because you're tripping me out right now.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.738
- Are you okay?
- No, I am.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.324
Ha, ha. I actually am. This is amazing.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.786
My entire life, I have feared this place.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.747
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?

11:47.915 --> 11:51.793
I could probably say,
"Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.629
You probably want us
to move in together?

11:56.006 --> 11:59.050
- It doesn't scare me.
- Yeah, well it scares me.

11:59.218 --> 12:03.138
I'm not even divorced yet.
You just invited me over here for pasta...

12:03.305 --> 12:06.307
...and all of a sudden
you're talking about moving in together.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.560
And I wasn't even that hungry.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.689
You know what? It's getting really late,
and I should just, um...

12:12.857 --> 12:15.859
Don't go. I've scared you.
I've said too much.

12:16.026 --> 12:19.070
I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.996
Hey, Janice, it's me.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.330
Uh, ahem.

12:29.498 --> 12:33.418
I wanted to apologize in advance
for having chased you down the street.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.378
Bye-bye.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.635
Here you go, honey. This will help.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.472
So I catch up to her and she says...

12:45.639 --> 12:48.099
...this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.019
- Ugh.
- Ugh. That is never good.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.979
Then I got all...

12:53.522 --> 12:55.690
...needy and clingy.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.611
Now, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad.
How did you leave it?

12:59.779 --> 13:00.820
She said she'd call me.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.241
Oh, God.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.745
Ugh. Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.831
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.627
Yeah, well,
it's that low-cal, nondairy, soy-milk junk.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.755
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.

13:19.548 --> 13:23.176
When you start getting screwed over
all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.261
Yeah, you do.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.680
So you don't think I'm terminal?

13:27.848 --> 13:32.101
Oh, no, not at all. You're not terminal.
We just need some damage control.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.145
Okay. Okay. So should I call her?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.064
No.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.735
It's a critical time. If you feel yourself
reaching for that phone...

13:40.903 --> 13:43.404
...you go shopping,
you get your butt in a bubble bath.

13:43.572 --> 13:47.158
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.410
She has to know you're not needy.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.371
So, what you have to do is...

13:51.539 --> 13:54.499
...you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose...

13:54.667 --> 13:56.501
...and then act aloof.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.755
So I'm not gonna lose her?

14:00.923 --> 14:03.508
Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.264
I said, so I'm not gonna lose her?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.058
Oh.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.189
Guess who's here.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.401
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.655
Real American hero
I'm G.I. Joe

14:25.823 --> 14:28.324
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

14:28.534 --> 14:32.120
G.I. Joe?
You really think he's gonna fall for that?

14:33.372 --> 14:36.749
G.I. Joe? Cool. Can I play?

14:38.460 --> 14:42.255
Look, Ben. It's a toy that protects
U.S. Oil interests overseas.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.507
Go, Joe!

14:45.676 --> 14:46.968
Hello. Oh.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.387
- Phoebe, there you are.
- No, it's not. Sorry.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.307
But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe. Phoebe.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.602
Oh, Joey. Oh, okay.
See, I didn't recognize you...

14:55.769 --> 14:57.353
...in those pants.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.649
That TV movie I went in for,
did you hear anything?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.610
I think I got a shot at it.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.528
Yes, they called. You didn't get it.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.617
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.286
That's okay. These things happen.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.289
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?

15:16.498 --> 15:18.625
You're in a terrible, terrible business.

15:19.877 --> 15:23.421
I don't wanna be the person
who makes your face look like that. Ugh.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.424
I'm okay. See?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.844
Now you're sad and creepy.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.639
You know what? I'm sorry. I quit, okay?

15:32.806 --> 15:36.476
No, no, no, you can't quit.
You're the best agent I ever had.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.188
Look, rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.

15:40.439 --> 15:45.026
Not personal? They said they'd never met
an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.153
They actually said that?

15:47.363 --> 15:51.324
Yeah. Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.743
No, this is why you have to do this job.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.119
Agents always lie.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.289
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way."

15:58.540 --> 16:00.333
But this? I can use this.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.378
I can work on a new accent.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.507
Yeah, okay. No.
If it helps you, okay. Yeah.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.135
You'll never get me, Joe!

16:24.191 --> 16:26.025
No, thank you.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.821
Chandler.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.323
Hello, Janice.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.869
What are you doing here?

16:37.037 --> 16:38.830
Uh, just a bit of shopping.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.873
How have you been?

16:41.917 --> 16:44.419
Are you being British?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.087
No.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.256
Not anymore.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.051
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.262
Were you here waiting for me?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.181
Yuh-huh.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.059
I'm just, uh, you know...

17:00.227 --> 17:02.687
...picking up some things for a party.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.398
Barley?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.693
What kind of a party serves barley?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.988
Well, I'm sorry if my friends
aren't as sophisticated as yours.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.950
- Where is this party?
- Here in Chelsea.

17:16.492 --> 17:17.910
Whose party is it?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.454
- A woman's.
- What woman?

17:21.957 --> 17:23.708
Chelsea.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.421
Either you're seeing somebody
behind my back...

17:28.589 --> 17:31.257
...which would make you
the biggest jerk on the planet...

17:31.425 --> 17:33.676
...or you're pretending
you're seeing somebody...

17:33.844 --> 17:37.513
...which just makes you so pathetic
I could just start crying right here.

17:37.681 --> 17:41.267
So which of these two guys
do you wanna be?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.479
Can I be that guy?

17:46.648 --> 17:50.902
Okay, we got some more good rejections.
Lots of stuff to work on.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.237
Oh. Okay. Shoot.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.115
Okay. Um... Oh, the zoo commercial.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.533
- I didn't get it?
- No.

17:57.701 --> 18:01.662
They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being."

18:02.623 --> 18:05.583
So you can work on that.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.543
Great. What else?

18:07.711 --> 18:11.672
Um, the off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb."

18:11.840 --> 18:14.175
- Oh.
- No, wait, I'm sorry. That's "pretty dumb."

18:14.343 --> 18:18.012
Oh. Look, it's okay, no, no, no. Really.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.514
Look, um...

18:19.681 --> 18:22.308
...I really appreciate this, Pheebs...

18:22.476 --> 18:24.894
...but I'm gonna have to go back
to Estelle.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.104
Oh.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.689
Don't get me wrong.
You're a better agent than she is...

18:28.857 --> 18:32.735
...but at least with her, I don't wanna
blow my pretty dumb brains out.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.947
Yeah, no, I understand.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.824
- You do? Thanks. Okay.
- Yeah.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.617
Sorry.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.038
- Wait a minute.
- What?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.456
Wait a minute.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.085
Did you just make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.629
Oh, he caught me.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.215
I am so busted.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.594
That's what I suspected.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.058
And then I just, you know...

19:04.476 --> 19:08.229
...threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.733
My God, Chandler, we said be aloof,
not a doof.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.238
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?

19:18.198 --> 19:20.324
It's time
for the good ice cream now, right?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.827
- Yeah, it is.
- Okay.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.205
You know what?
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.459
Hello?

19:31.378 --> 19:33.045
Hi, Janice.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.922
Can you hold on for a second?

19:35.090 --> 19:36.757
Okay. Okay.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.050
What do I do?

19:38.218 --> 19:40.178
I don't know. This is unprecedented.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.055
If we ever did what you did,
a man would never call.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.265
Hello?

19:44.433 --> 19:47.435
I got it. Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.770
- Be sleepy.
- Yes. And grumpy.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.648
What are you...? Stop naming dwarves.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.778
Hello, Janice. Hi.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.573
I'm so glad that you called.

20:01.783 --> 20:06.204
I know I've been acting
really weird lately...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.583
...and it's just because
I'm crazy about you...

20:13.253 --> 20:17.423
...and I just got stupid and scared...

20:17.591 --> 20:19.550
...and stupid a couple more times.

20:20.844 --> 20:21.886
And I'm sorry.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.931
Really?

20:25.766 --> 20:28.434
Ha, ha. Really?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.937
He's so lucky. If Janice were a guy...

20:31.104 --> 20:33.940
...she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.525
I love you too.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.402
Ugh. It's so unfair.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.788
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?

20:48.956 --> 20:52.792
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.503
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.130
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.717
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.

21:03.679 --> 21:07.640
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.934
You used to dress up like a woman.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.775
What?

21:17.943 --> 21:20.278
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.363
What are you talking about?

21:22.614 --> 21:25.533
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.369
Okay. You are totally making this up.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.871
How can you not remember?

21:31.039 --> 21:32.748
You made us call you "Bea"?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.173
Oh, God.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.261
I've literally never been this happy.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.555
Wasn't there a little song?

21:47.764 --> 21:50.182
Oh, please, God, let there be a song.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.560
There was no song. There was no song.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.145
I am Bea

21:54.646 --> 21:56.397
- I drink tea...
- That's enough.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.982
Won't you?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.191
Oh.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.776
Won't you?

22:01.486 --> 22:02.778
Won't you?

22:04.406 --> 22:06.866
- Won't you dance around with me?
- Ha-ha-ha.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.000
I am Bea

22:16.168 --> 22:18.878
I drink tea

22:19.046 --> 22:23.632
Won't you dance around with...?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.603
Ross!
