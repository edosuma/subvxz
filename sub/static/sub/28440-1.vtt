01:13.847 --> 01:16.481
I used to wear them to church.

01:16.517 --> 01:18.950
I can see that.

01:18.986 --> 01:21.253
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:21.288 --> 01:24.489
Oh, how I love a wedding.

01:24.525 --> 01:27.592
Mary Abigail, I can't believe
you brought work with you

01:27.628 --> 01:28.560
to a wedding.

01:28.595 --> 01:31.163
I didn't. I just like
to be prepared so I...

01:31.198 --> 01:32.297
It doesn't matter.

01:32.332 --> 01:33.943
Listen, I told Scott that
I would meet him out here

01:33.967 --> 01:35.667
so let's get you seated.

01:35.702 --> 01:39.438
Hi, I'm Abbey
and this is my aunt, Francis.

01:39.473 --> 01:40.705
Nice to meet you.

01:40.741 --> 01:43.708
And there's gonna be
three of us on the groom's side

01:43.744 --> 01:45.811
so if you could just
get her seated

01:45.846 --> 01:47.479
somewhere on an aisle,

01:47.514 --> 01:49.948
maybe like four to six rows
from the front.

01:49.983 --> 01:51.883
And not behind
someone with a big hat.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.754
See ya in there.

01:56.223 --> 01:57.255
Sorry.

02:44.371 --> 02:45.537
A toast!

02:48.442 --> 02:54.012
My wish is for each one of you
to find the love and happiness

02:54.047 --> 02:55.247
that we found today.

02:55.282 --> 02:56.748
A toast to love.

02:56.783 --> 02:58.183
To love!

02:59.586 --> 03:01.653
Wherever you are.

03:06.326 --> 03:07.726
Don't look at me like that.

03:07.761 --> 03:09.060
Well, it's his loss.

03:09.096 --> 03:11.796
Yeah, that's what
everybody says,

03:11.832 --> 03:14.399
but I'm the common denominator
in all of these break-ups.

03:14.434 --> 03:18.203
I'm the one that's
too cold and too closed off

03:18.238 --> 03:19.704
and too judgmental.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.039
Or too critical of herself.

03:21.074 --> 03:23.074
Yes. Thank you.
You can add that to the list.

03:23.110 --> 03:24.110
That's not what I mean.

03:24.144 --> 03:25.221
I mean you've always been
so hard on yourself.

03:25.245 --> 03:27.746
I mean, have you ever looked
in the mirror and say,

03:27.781 --> 03:30.949
"Hey Abby, you're great"?

03:30.984 --> 03:31.883
No.

03:31.919 --> 03:33.118
Well, you should.

03:33.153 --> 03:35.654
In fact, I think you should
do what your father always did

03:35.689 --> 03:37.589
when he was feeling discouraged.

03:37.624 --> 03:38.590
What?

03:38.625 --> 03:40.392
When he and I were kids
he got into the habit

03:40.427 --> 03:43.228
of writing himself
pep talk letters.

03:43.263 --> 03:44.129
My dad?

03:44.164 --> 03:45.363
Yeah. Pep talk letters.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.677
Letters listing all the things
that he liked about himself.

03:47.701 --> 03:49.479
Things that he knew the right
person would appreciate

03:49.503 --> 03:50.835
about him when he fell in love.

03:50.871 --> 03:51.803
My dad did this?

03:51.838 --> 03:52.804
Yep.

03:52.839 --> 03:53.805
You seem surprised.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.308
I am. He doesn't seem like
the romantic type.

03:56.343 --> 03:58.343
Do you have paper in that office
you brought?

03:58.378 --> 03:59.344
Yeah.

03:59.379 --> 04:01.179
Yes.

04:01.214 --> 04:03.682
Yeah, why?

04:03.717 --> 04:06.151
Well, just give it to me.

04:06.186 --> 04:07.485
I want you to write a letter.

04:07.521 --> 04:10.288
Open up your heart,
just be vulnerable.

04:10.324 --> 04:13.258
Don't be nervous about it, it's
just you and a piece of paper.

04:13.293 --> 04:14.492
Just don't think about it.

04:14.528 --> 04:15.660
I don't... I... no.

04:15.696 --> 04:18.296
Just don't think about it,
just write to the universe,

04:18.332 --> 04:21.366
or to your love who is
out there somewhere.

04:21.401 --> 04:23.001
Just write about your passions.

04:23.036 --> 04:24.436
Your dreams.

04:24.471 --> 04:25.971
Who you are.

04:26.006 --> 04:27.006
Who you want.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.940
Just let it all pour out.

04:28.976 --> 04:30.675
And then I want you
to take that letter

04:30.711 --> 04:36.731
and I want you to put it
in this bottle

04:37.584 --> 04:39.865
and then I want you to throw
that bottle out in the water.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.686
Yeah.

04:41.722 --> 04:43.333
I want you to throw your whole
heart out into the world.

04:43.357 --> 04:46.691
I mean, it's symbolic
but it'll be very,

04:46.727 --> 04:48.693
very good for you.

04:48.729 --> 04:50.462
Very good.

05:13.286 --> 05:19.763
<i>Dear love,
somewhere out there...</i>

05:22.396 --> 05:24.029
This is so silly.

05:33.273 --> 05:35.540
<i>Do you ever feel unknown?</i>

05:35.575 --> 05:38.443
<i>Like everyone has already
labelled you and filed you away</i>

05:38.478 --> 05:42.380
<i>as complete without giving you
the chance to learn and grow?</i>

05:42.416 --> 05:43.581
<i>I have a big heart.</i>

05:43.617 --> 05:47.252
<i>I feel so much, but I've never
known how to show it.</i>

05:47.287 --> 05:49.587
<i>I'm loyal and trustworthy.</i>

05:49.623 --> 05:52.257
<i>I have a deep conscience.</i>

05:52.292 --> 05:54.037
<i>I stole a pack of gum once
in the second grade</i>

05:54.061 --> 05:56.394
<i>and I couldn't sleep for a week.</i>

05:56.430 --> 05:58.463
<i>I'm a good listener,
I'm great at my job,</i>

05:58.498 --> 06:00.065
<i>and I love pancakes.</i>

06:00.100 --> 06:03.101
<i>Pancakes will make me happy
any time.</i>

06:08.341 --> 06:12.310
<i>But mostly, I want
something real.</i>

06:12.345 --> 06:15.080
<i>I have the depth to walk through
real life struggle</i>

06:15.115 --> 06:17.649
<i>and come out the other side
and I'm looking</i>

06:17.684 --> 06:19.150
<i>for someone like that, too.</i>

06:19.186 --> 06:20.885
<i>Flawed, but open.</i>

06:20.921 --> 06:24.155
<i>Impossible to label
and file away.</i>

06:24.191 --> 06:26.791
<i>I think we all deserve that,
don't we?</i>

06:26.827 --> 06:29.494
<i>I'm willing to take the risk.</i>

06:29.529 --> 06:31.629
<i>Come find me.</i>

07:03.029 --> 07:04.162
This is ridiculous.

07:04.197 --> 07:06.965
Technically, I'm about
to pollute.

07:30.323 --> 07:32.056
Morning.

07:32.092 --> 07:33.825
Abbey! Abbey!

07:33.860 --> 07:35.660
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:35.695 --> 07:38.363
Supposedly,
Everson's going public.

07:38.398 --> 07:39.364
Really?

07:39.399 --> 07:40.365
Yeah.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.044
So now is your chance
to impress Mr. Everson

07:42.068 --> 07:43.468
and get that big promotion.

07:43.503 --> 07:44.736
Yeah.

07:44.771 --> 07:46.237
Abbey hi.

07:46.273 --> 07:47.438
Hi.

07:47.474 --> 07:48.918
Elaine mentioned you went to
a wedding at the Rowing Club

07:48.942 --> 07:49.841
on the weekend

07:49.876 --> 07:52.210
and we would love
your thoughts, please.

07:52.245 --> 07:53.878
There was a mix-up
at our original venue

07:53.914 --> 07:56.214
and we need to find a
replacement as soon as possible.

07:56.249 --> 07:58.249
Yeah, sure.

07:58.285 --> 07:59.328
OK, let's see, Rowing Club.

07:59.352 --> 08:02.587
Food was spectacular,
views were amazing.

08:02.622 --> 08:03.454
The staff was well-trained,

08:03.490 --> 08:05.390
everything seemed
really organized.

08:05.425 --> 08:07.192
Decor was amazing.

08:07.227 --> 08:09.060
I think it gets a big
thumbs up, Sophie.

08:09.095 --> 08:11.196
Fantastic. I'm going
to call them.

08:11.231 --> 08:12.063
Yeah, sure.

08:12.098 --> 08:13.398
See you.

08:15.735 --> 08:16.568
So?

08:16.603 --> 08:17.769
So.

08:17.804 --> 08:20.171
So, how'd it go, introducing
Scott to your Aunt Francis?

08:20.207 --> 08:21.239
It didn't.

08:21.274 --> 08:23.208
He broke up with me instead.

08:23.243 --> 08:24.142
What?

08:24.177 --> 08:25.844
Yeah, I was a mess
for the whole wedding.

08:25.879 --> 08:31.616
And somehow my
Aunt Francis convinced me

08:31.651 --> 08:36.453
to write a letter to love.

08:37.323 --> 08:41.693
And then, put it into a bottle.

08:43.230 --> 08:45.697
I threw it out to sea.

08:45.732 --> 08:46.798
I'm sorry, just give me...

08:46.833 --> 08:49.234
just give me a minute to wrap
my head around that.

08:49.269 --> 08:51.035
I blame the whole thing
on Aunt Francis.

08:51.071 --> 08:51.970
And champagne.

08:52.005 --> 08:56.374
But I have to say...
you know me, I mean,

08:56.409 --> 08:58.109
I don't, like, open up a lot...

08:58.144 --> 08:58.910
Ever.

08:58.945 --> 08:59.878
I mean, a lot.

08:59.913 --> 09:00.778
Right, yeah.

09:00.814 --> 09:02.881
It did feel really good
to be that open.

09:02.916 --> 09:04.594
Sounds like you had a few things
bottled up there.

09:04.618 --> 09:06.284
Oh, geez.

09:08.355 --> 09:11.489
Well, it's all out there now.

09:11.524 --> 09:14.292
In the bottom of Boston Harbor.

09:15.528 --> 09:16.895
Where it shall remain.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.668
I've made a ranking of all
our possible acquisitions.

09:23.703 --> 09:27.171
The green tab is all
the players and breakdowns.

09:27.207 --> 09:28.273
Nice work, Abbey.

09:28.308 --> 09:29.340
Thank you.

09:29.376 --> 09:31.843
The blue tab is the schedule
of all the meetings.

09:31.878 --> 09:33.645
- So...
- OK.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.812
Did we just say "meetings"?

09:34.848 --> 09:37.148
I'm giving Abbey the job of
adding another money maker

09:37.183 --> 09:39.350
to our portfolio
before we go public.

09:39.386 --> 09:42.020
Fine, but you are under
strict orders from your doctor

09:42.055 --> 09:44.322
to cut your schedule in half.

09:44.357 --> 09:45.357
I'm sorry, Abbey.

09:45.392 --> 09:47.169
I know it would be helpful
to have dad with you

09:47.193 --> 09:49.260
in some of those meetings
but he just can't do it.

09:49.296 --> 09:50.461
Sophie's right.

09:50.497 --> 09:51.663
I understand.

09:51.698 --> 09:53.175
I would go with you, but
between two product launches

09:53.199 --> 09:55.199
and the wedding I'm so slammed.

09:55.235 --> 09:56.200
No, don't worry about it.

09:56.236 --> 09:58.036
You know, I know we don't have
a lot of time

09:58.071 --> 09:59.711
but we have some great
companies lined up.

09:59.739 --> 10:00.805
I can do this.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.706
Thanks, Abbey.

10:01.741 --> 10:03.274
I gotta take a look
at that schedule,

10:03.310 --> 10:04.310
see what I can make.

10:04.344 --> 10:05.310
I would love that.

10:05.345 --> 10:08.346
It always helps to have
an Everson in the room.

10:09.916 --> 10:12.183
You know, that Abbey
really is impressive.

10:12.218 --> 10:13.184
I agree.

10:13.219 --> 10:15.153
She's structured, focused.

10:15.188 --> 10:17.388
Would be a good influence
on your son.

10:17.424 --> 10:19.724
He's floundering,
he is not focused.

10:19.759 --> 10:22.694
Is it wrong for me to want him
to have some stability?

10:22.729 --> 10:23.795
Some roots?

10:23.830 --> 10:24.796
Of course not.

10:24.831 --> 10:27.065
But that would involve
getting him back here.

10:28.935 --> 10:31.536
He worked here for two years,
he did a terrific job,

10:31.571 --> 10:36.908
then one day I get a postcard
from a salmon boat in Alaska.

10:36.943 --> 10:40.044
He said he couldn't work
in an office anymore.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.845
It wasn't him.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.314
Dad, you can't exactly
fault him.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.282
He makes his own money,

10:44.317 --> 10:47.251
he sublets his place
when he's out of town,

10:47.287 --> 10:50.989
and he has never once asked you
for a single thing.

10:51.024 --> 10:53.424
He's not in his '20's anymore.

10:53.460 --> 10:57.695
I was hoping he'd get whatever
it was out of his system by now.

10:59.299 --> 11:02.033
Dad, I can't make a single one
of these meetings.

11:02.068 --> 11:05.503
It would be nice to have
Nick back.

11:05.538 --> 11:09.073
You know, maybe there is a way
we can get him back here.

11:09.109 --> 11:10.441
He'd never go for it.

11:10.477 --> 11:13.544
Every time I broach
the subject he bristles.

11:13.580 --> 11:17.281
Yes, but that is always you
wanting him back here full time,

11:17.317 --> 11:20.051
which is this big,
daunting commitment.

11:20.086 --> 11:23.287
What if it was just something
for the short term?

11:23.323 --> 11:27.058
Something just so he can get
his foot back in the door?

11:27.093 --> 11:28.893
See if he might like it again?

11:30.330 --> 11:31.396
Imagine that.

11:46.179 --> 11:48.179
Who pollutes nowadays?

11:54.988 --> 11:57.588
Soph.

11:57.624 --> 11:58.556
How're ya doing?

11:58.591 --> 11:59.490
Well, if you walked
into my office right now

11:59.526 --> 12:01.426
you would think I was
a wedding planner

12:01.461 --> 12:03.728
not an executive VP at Everson.

12:03.763 --> 12:05.596
But aside from that I am great.

12:05.632 --> 12:07.343
Kevin and I are really excited
about the wedding

12:07.367 --> 12:09.500
and I just emailed you
the schedule,

12:09.536 --> 12:11.602
<i>but I'd sure love to see
you before then.</i>

12:11.638 --> 12:14.338
I'll be there for the wedding
and everything related.

12:14.374 --> 12:16.307
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

12:16.342 --> 12:18.076
So dad's about to call
and ask you something

12:18.111 --> 12:20.144
and I want you to say "yes".

12:20.180 --> 12:22.580
<i>I'm invoking full
bridal privilege.</i>

12:22.615 --> 12:23.793
As long as it has nothing to do

12:23.817 --> 12:25.450
with me coming back there
to work.

12:25.485 --> 12:27.163
I already had that argument
with him enough times,

12:27.187 --> 12:28.252
<i>I'm not having it again.</i>

12:28.288 --> 12:30.755
It's not what you think.
It's just a short-term project.

12:30.790 --> 12:31.790
No strings attached.

12:32.492 --> 12:33.691
Yeah, somehow I doubt that.

12:33.726 --> 12:37.495
The company's going public and
dad wants to make a big splash.

12:37.530 --> 12:38.796
That sounds like dad.

12:38.832 --> 12:41.010
<i>Well, he's gotten it in his head
to add this new acquisition</i>

12:41.034 --> 12:43.101
to the portfolio and it would
really help

12:43.136 --> 12:45.002
to have an extra Everson
around helping out.

12:45.038 --> 12:47.972
- Soph...
- Nick, you know the business.

12:48.007 --> 12:50.942
And it would give you a chance
to get to know Kevin better.

12:55.181 --> 12:56.481
OK, alright.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.195
I guess I'm coming back
to Boston.

12:59.219 --> 13:00.318
This is gonna be so great!

13:00.353 --> 13:01.497
And it's just until the wedding.

13:01.521 --> 13:02.521
Alright.

13:02.555 --> 13:03.454
OK.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.790
Well... I love you.

13:05.825 --> 13:07.191
I love you, too.

13:09.596 --> 13:11.028
OK.

13:25.245 --> 13:26.210
Dad.

13:26.246 --> 13:27.512
<i>Nick.</i>

13:27.547 --> 13:30.348
Hey. How are ya?

14:12.225 --> 14:13.658
Great.

14:15.762 --> 14:17.862
Here we go again.

14:22.502 --> 14:24.635
Sue, can you tell Nick
we're waiting for him?

14:24.671 --> 14:25.703
<i>Yes sir.</i>

14:25.738 --> 14:27.271
<i>Yeah, yeah great seeing
you, as well.</i>

14:27.307 --> 14:29.073
<i>We'll continue it in a minute.</i>

14:29.108 --> 14:30.208
- Hey, guys.
- Morning Nick.

14:30.243 --> 14:31.375
Coffee upgrade, huh?

14:31.411 --> 14:32.577
Look at that.

14:34.948 --> 14:36.714
There he is.

14:36.749 --> 14:39.217
There he is.
How're you doing, Nick?

14:39.252 --> 14:40.952
- Good to see you, dad.
- You too.

14:40.987 --> 14:41.752
Yeah.

14:41.788 --> 14:43.654
Hi. Abbey Lawrence.

14:43.690 --> 14:45.122
- Hi, Abbey.
- Hi.

14:45.158 --> 14:47.358
Nick. Everson.

14:50.263 --> 14:51.562
You're late, Nick.

14:51.598 --> 14:52.563
Yeah.

14:52.599 --> 14:54.265
Dad, you had no coffee mugs.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.133
All I could find was this.

14:56.169 --> 14:58.402
It looks like a preschooler's
art project.

14:58.438 --> 15:01.572
That pottery class was a gift
from my Secret Santa.

15:02.775 --> 15:05.142
Keep working on it.

15:05.178 --> 15:08.946
I've asked Nick here to come and
help you with the acquisition.

15:08.982 --> 15:12.116
Help-help-help me-help-help-how?

15:12.151 --> 15:15.186
With so much work tied up in
this and me being less available,

15:15.221 --> 15:17.255
plus wasn't it you who said

15:17.290 --> 15:20.291
it can never hurt to have
an Everson in the room?

15:21.060 --> 15:21.826
You said that?

15:21.861 --> 15:22.927
I did say that.

15:24.897 --> 15:26.797
I did say that.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.467
So what company did you
come from?

15:29.502 --> 15:35.006
I... I was in Brazil,
Alaska, Peru...

15:36.142 --> 15:37.620
Is there a particular
acquisitions company

15:37.644 --> 15:39.143
that you worked for, or...?

15:39.178 --> 15:40.878
Tuna Trawler?

15:42.982 --> 15:45.383
Yes, that should be
very helpful.

15:45.418 --> 15:48.853
Nick, Abbey is our top analyst
in acquisitions.

15:48.888 --> 15:50.454
Our ace.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.990
She has incredible taste,
laser focused.

15:53.026 --> 15:55.126
I think you can learn a lot
from her.

15:57.530 --> 15:59.797
I think this is really
gonna work.

16:07.507 --> 16:08.639
I don't get it.

16:08.675 --> 16:09.774
I don't need help.

16:09.809 --> 16:12.009
When was the last time I asked
for help on anything?

16:12.045 --> 16:13.477
That would be never, sweetheart.

16:13.513 --> 16:14.745
Yeah, exactly.

16:14.781 --> 16:17.159
And when I said it would be nice
to have an Everson in the room

16:17.183 --> 16:18.883
I meant Mr. Everson,
or Sophie.

16:18.918 --> 16:20.162
Nick is the one that you
never see.

16:20.186 --> 16:21.719
He's the Everson
that you hear about

16:21.754 --> 16:23.087
never showing up for holidays.

16:23.122 --> 16:24.667
He's not even gonna take
this seriously.

16:24.691 --> 16:26.023
Maybe he'll surprise you.

16:26.059 --> 16:29.994
No, he's gonna slow me down.

16:30.029 --> 16:33.764
Like it or not, it looks like
you're gonna have to try

16:33.800 --> 16:36.233
to make the best of this,
Mary Abigail.

16:36.269 --> 16:37.868
I hate when you call me that.

16:37.904 --> 16:39.837
Sorry.

16:39.872 --> 16:40.705
You're right.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.180
I mean, I have a promotion
coming up,

16:42.208 --> 16:44.742
I have to find a way
to make it work.

16:44.777 --> 16:47.178
I'm gonna set the tone
right away.

16:59.459 --> 17:03.361
Dear Nick, attached you'll find
the research files

17:03.396 --> 17:06.297
concerning our meeting tomorrow
with Kat and Charlie

17:06.332 --> 17:11.435
of Kat and Charlie's Ice Cream.

17:11.471 --> 17:15.239
Please read all files.

17:16.108 --> 17:17.040
Look at this.

17:17.076 --> 17:19.276
It's my newest beer creation.

17:21.580 --> 17:23.146
Ranking out of five or ten?

17:23.182 --> 17:24.415
Ten. Come on.

17:24.450 --> 17:25.450
OK.

17:29.489 --> 17:30.721
This is the best yet.

17:30.757 --> 17:32.957
This is an eight and a half,
for sure.

17:32.992 --> 17:34.725
Ooh.

17:34.761 --> 17:36.060
I think I'm gonna retire.

17:36.095 --> 17:36.961
Yeah, you could do that.

17:36.996 --> 17:37.928
Yeah.

17:37.964 --> 17:38.964
And move home.

17:38.998 --> 17:39.897
Make beer.

17:39.932 --> 17:41.477
That's a... that's a...
that's a great idea.

17:41.501 --> 17:43.601
Oh yeah. Very great idea.

17:43.636 --> 17:44.969
Hey, listen.

17:45.004 --> 17:49.440
So... Abbey Lawrence.

17:49.475 --> 17:52.410
I don't think she's exactly
thrilled about me being here.

17:52.445 --> 17:53.944
How well do you know her?

17:53.980 --> 17:54.980
Very well.

17:55.014 --> 17:56.180
She's great.

17:56.215 --> 17:58.649
OK, well you know that I'm
pretty good at reading people,

17:58.684 --> 18:01.285
and I think that I know exactly
who she is.

18:01.320 --> 18:06.590
Controlling, and a nitpicker.

18:06.626 --> 18:08.159
What does that make me then?

18:09.896 --> 18:13.097
OK, she is a professional
and she is smart

18:13.132 --> 18:14.932
and we are very lucky
to have her.

18:16.869 --> 18:17.668
OK.

18:17.703 --> 18:18.814
You're entitled to your
own opinion.

18:18.838 --> 18:20.538
Oh, look at this.

18:20.573 --> 18:21.639
This is her right here.

18:21.674 --> 18:24.442
"Dear Nick, attached you'll
find the research... "

18:24.477 --> 18:28.112
Sending me a ridiculous amount
of files.

18:29.382 --> 18:32.483
If we're to work together
I expect you

18:32.518 --> 18:34.452
to be fully prepared
and up to speed.

18:34.487 --> 18:35.986
"I expect you"?

18:36.022 --> 18:37.488
What am I, 12?

18:37.523 --> 18:40.458
- Nick, give her a chance, OK?
- Sophie...

18:40.493 --> 18:42.293
Dad is thrilled you're here

18:42.328 --> 18:46.464
and I think this is gonna be
good for you.

18:46.499 --> 18:51.202
Soph, I hate to say this
but when we're through

18:51.237 --> 18:54.538
I'm going back.

18:54.574 --> 18:58.242
Well, brother, I'm just glad
you're here.

18:58.277 --> 19:00.911
Even if it's for a little while.

19:00.947 --> 19:02.012
Cheers.

19:02.048 --> 19:04.615
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

19:21.601 --> 19:23.567
How'd you get in there?

19:42.488 --> 19:45.422
<i>Dear love, somewhere out there.</i>

19:45.458 --> 19:47.291
<i>Do you ever feel unknown,</i>

19:47.326 --> 19:49.059
<i>like everyone has already
labelled you</i>

19:49.095 --> 19:51.462
<i>and filed you away as complete
without giving you</i>

19:51.631 --> 19:53.864
<i>the chance to learn and grow?</i>

19:53.900 --> 19:55.032
<i>I have a big heart.</i>

19:55.067 --> 19:58.235
<i>I feel so much, but I've never
known how to show it</i>

19:58.271 --> 20:01.405
<i>so it always seems like
I don't have a voice,</i>

20:01.440 --> 20:03.440
<i>like I'm not here.</i>

20:03.476 --> 20:04.642
<i>But I am here.</i>

20:04.677 --> 20:09.813
<i>I'm loyal and trustworthy,
I have a deep conscience.</i>

20:09.849 --> 20:11.627
<i>I stole a pack of gum once
in the second grade</i>

20:11.651 --> 20:13.951
<i>and I couldn't sleep for a week.</i>

20:13.986 --> 20:16.620
<i>I'm a good listener,
I'm great at my job,</i>

20:16.656 --> 20:20.124
<i>I do a mean impersonation of
a trumpet and I love pancakes.</i>

20:20.159 --> 20:23.594
<i>Like, pancakes will make me
happy any time.</i>

20:23.629 --> 20:28.132
Yes, I want all the romance
of travel and stargazing,

20:28.167 --> 20:30.801
night swimming.

20:30.836 --> 20:31.936
That's nice.

20:31.971 --> 20:34.471
<i>I have the depth to walk through
real life struggle</i>

20:34.507 --> 20:35.517
<i>and come out the other side</i>

20:35.541 --> 20:38.309
<i>and I'm looking for someone
like that, too.</i>

20:38.344 --> 20:40.311
<i>Flawed, but open.</i>

20:40.346 --> 20:43.414
<i>Impossible to label
and file away.</i>

20:43.449 --> 20:45.616
<i>I'm willing to take the risk.</i>

20:45.651 --> 20:47.084
<i>Come find me.</i>

20:47.119 --> 20:54.692
MLBeantown@yahoo.com
ML Beantown.

20:54.727 --> 20:57.361
Beantown?

20:57.396 --> 20:58.796
She's here?

20:58.831 --> 21:00.831
In Boston?

21:01.467 --> 21:03.033
He just couldn't tell
a good joke.

21:03.069 --> 21:04.212
Like he always missed
the punchline?

21:04.236 --> 21:05.236
Yeah, absolutely.

21:06.172 --> 21:07.204
Absolutely.

21:07.239 --> 21:08.850
It's probably Nick Everson
complaining about

21:08.874 --> 21:12.042
the amount of work I sent him.

21:12.078 --> 21:14.778
Reeltraveler, your message
in a bottle.

21:17.216 --> 21:19.350
Oh no!

21:19.385 --> 21:21.151
Someone found my letter.

21:28.629 --> 21:32.331
A complete stranger found
my message in a bottle

21:32.366 --> 21:34.600
and just emailed me.

21:34.635 --> 21:35.400
What?

21:35.436 --> 21:36.869
You.
You started this.

21:36.904 --> 21:37.948
Well, just don't stand there.

21:37.972 --> 21:39.104
This is exciting.

21:39.140 --> 21:40.105
Open it.

21:40.141 --> 21:42.107
- Read it to me.
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

21:44.378 --> 21:48.413
Dear ML Beantown,

21:48.449 --> 21:52.651
I'm writing to tell you that I
found your message in a bottle.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.320
You put your heart into this
letter and I wanted you to know

21:55.356 --> 21:58.257
that both the letter
and the sentiments inside

21:58.292 --> 21:59.358
are safe with me.

21:59.393 --> 22:00.259
Well, that's not so bad.

22:00.294 --> 22:01.760
That's kinda nice.

22:01.795 --> 22:04.163
If you're interested
in exchanging a bottle

22:04.198 --> 22:05.964
for the far more
conventional method

22:06.000 --> 22:08.967
of an online chat,
I'm here and intrigued.

22:09.003 --> 22:10.169
This is exciting!

22:10.204 --> 22:10.969
What're you waiting for?

22:11.005 --> 22:12.838
Write him back.
Write him back.

22:12.873 --> 22:13.739
Yes.

22:13.774 --> 22:14.540
I'm not gonna write...
that could be any...

22:14.575 --> 22:16.275
no, I'm not gonna
write anything.

22:16.310 --> 22:17.310
That could be anybody.

22:17.344 --> 22:21.313
Yes, it could, but it also
could be a somebody.

22:21.348 --> 22:23.982
And I'm gonna leave you to it.

22:40.834 --> 22:44.570
Dear Reeltraveler,

22:44.605 --> 22:47.806
thank you for letting me know
that my letter is safe.

22:47.841 --> 22:49.074
I'm a bit embarrassed,

22:49.109 --> 22:53.145
I have to tell you the letter
was written after a weak moment

22:53.180 --> 22:54.713
at a wedding.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.769
Nothing to be embarrassed about,

23:17.805 --> 23:21.540
I've had one or two
of those myself.

23:21.575 --> 23:23.175
<i>Wait, I'm the guy.</i>

23:23.210 --> 23:24.576
<i>I'm supposed to be tough.</i>

23:24.678 --> 23:25.911
<i>Was I supposed to admit that?</i>

23:25.946 --> 23:28.180
OK. You're a guy.

23:28.215 --> 23:29.081
Noted.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.849
<i>I found your openness
refreshing.</i>

23:32.319 --> 23:33.518
That's nice of you to say.

23:33.554 --> 23:34.564
<i>It would have been easy to
be judgemental or critical,</i>

23:34.588 --> 23:37.389
<i>there's a lot of people
out there like that.</i>

23:37.424 --> 23:39.424
You can say that again.

23:40.594 --> 23:43.729
<i>ML Beantown, can
I go ahead and ask,</i>

23:43.764 --> 23:47.165
<i>have you found someone yet?</i>

24:03.851 --> 24:05.328
What do you mean, you
didn't write him back?

24:05.352 --> 24:07.252
It's a very personal question.

24:07.288 --> 24:09.065
The man already knows
your most personal thoughts

24:09.089 --> 24:12.257
because you put them
into a bottle and threw them

24:12.293 --> 24:13.125
into the sea.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.092
I know, I know.

24:14.128 --> 24:17.129
But, you know, statistically
this is a person

24:17.164 --> 24:18.196
who found a bottle,

24:18.232 --> 24:20.565
so it's probably just like
a 90 year old ex-convict

24:20.601 --> 24:22.134
from Poughkeepsie.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.068
Forget statistics.

24:23.103 --> 24:25.003
Something exciting
just happened to you.

24:25.039 --> 24:27.806
Somebody found your message
and contacted you.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.007
Please don't shut it down.

24:29.043 --> 24:30.242
Just play it out.

24:30.277 --> 24:33.812
OK, alright, I will write
him back.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.281
You just made some
90 year old ex-convict

24:36.317 --> 24:37.849
in Poughkeepsie very happy.

24:38.986 --> 24:40.585
I love this side of you.

24:42.289 --> 24:43.622
Hey.

24:43.657 --> 24:44.823
Hi.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.692
- Hi.
- Hey.

24:46.727 --> 24:48.805
We're supposed to be at Kat
and Charlie's in 30 minutes.

24:48.829 --> 24:50.307
I'm kinda surprised I have
to come remind you.

24:50.331 --> 24:51.430
You didn't.

24:51.465 --> 24:53.343
I told you the meeting was
an hour earlier than it is

24:53.367 --> 24:54.232
because you were late yesterday

24:54.268 --> 24:56.935
and I didn't want to take
any chances.

24:58.072 --> 24:59.271
Well, that's fun.

24:59.306 --> 25:01.273
Is every meeting gonna be
like that?

25:02.743 --> 25:04.509
So Kat and Charlie's
has a lot of potential,

25:04.545 --> 25:06.211
they're a good fit
for the Everson brand.

25:06.246 --> 25:08.313
The problem is they're
a relatively new business

25:08.349 --> 25:11.516
so there's not a long history
of sales to bank on.

25:11.552 --> 25:12.951
Hello? Hi.

25:12.986 --> 25:14.721
Hello. Hi.

25:16.357 --> 25:19.391
And not a long history
of sales to bank on.

25:19.426 --> 25:22.160
Did you read the files
I sent you?

25:22.196 --> 25:23.395
Enough of them.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.463
Come on.

25:24.498 --> 25:25.330
Not a person in the world
could have read through

25:25.366 --> 25:27.632
all the files you sent
in one night.

25:27.668 --> 25:29.101
Follow my lead.

25:30.537 --> 25:31.937
Follow my lead.

25:32.873 --> 25:35.040
This is amazing, what
you guys have built here.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.820
Did you know that you were
gonna get into ice cream

25:36.844 --> 25:38.210
when you met each other?

25:38.245 --> 25:39.489
To tell you the truth
we were just

25:39.513 --> 25:42.080
a couple of grad students
having fun.

25:42.116 --> 25:44.516
Suddenly our crazy flavours
caught on

25:44.551 --> 25:46.251
and the whole thing
just took off.

25:46.286 --> 25:48.854
We were surprised as anyone
by how it grew.

25:48.889 --> 25:49.821
Don't get us wrong,

25:49.857 --> 25:52.891
we have had a blast
in the last few years.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.871
But neither one of us planned
on spending our lives

25:54.895 --> 25:56.561
in the ice cream business.

25:56.597 --> 25:57.362
No.

25:57.398 --> 25:58.563
Right this way.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.765
Look at this.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.001
The financial records that
you asked for are all in here.

26:03.036 --> 26:04.136
Thank you.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.272
And here are some of our
top sellers for you to try.

26:07.307 --> 26:08.840
Thank you, Kelly.

26:08.876 --> 26:10.108
Looks terrific.

26:10.144 --> 26:12.844
Well, we will leave you to it
and if you have any questions

26:12.880 --> 26:14.679
we will be at an employee event.

26:14.715 --> 26:15.847
OK.

26:15.883 --> 26:17.015
Thank you.

26:17.050 --> 26:18.517
Yeah, let's try some ice cream.

26:18.552 --> 26:19.863
No, we're not here
to try ice cream,

26:19.887 --> 26:21.686
we're here to work.

26:21.722 --> 26:23.299
You're not gonna try the product
of the company

26:23.323 --> 26:25.524
you might acquire?

26:25.559 --> 26:26.925
What if you don't like it?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.226
It doesn't matter if I like it.

26:28.262 --> 26:29.472
It matters if other people
like it.

26:29.496 --> 26:32.564
Sales. Past sales.
Projected sales. Operating costs.

26:32.599 --> 26:34.633
Why don't we take a walk around?

26:34.668 --> 26:36.234
Meet some employees?

26:36.270 --> 26:38.069
Get to know the place, you know?
Get a feel.

26:38.105 --> 26:39.037
OK, OK.

26:39.072 --> 26:39.971
I think we probably have
very different ways

26:40.007 --> 26:41.440
of going about this

26:41.475 --> 26:43.408
so why don't you assess
the company the way

26:43.444 --> 26:47.245
that you want to and I will
assess the company the right way?

26:52.786 --> 26:54.085
Right way?

26:59.026 --> 26:59.791
Alright.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.461
Yeah, this is...
this is fun, guys.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.262
Do you do this all the time?
This is great.

27:04.298 --> 27:08.233
OK, up next:
green tea wasabi swirl.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.972
OK.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.041
I don't know how I feel
about this one.

27:24.685 --> 27:25.951
- I can't...
- We need some water.

27:25.986 --> 27:28.086
Yeah, thank you.

27:35.896 --> 27:38.530
That one... that one
has a big kick to it.

27:40.234 --> 27:41.933
OK, moving on.

27:41.969 --> 27:45.036
Strawberry bourbon blast.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.946
Right.

27:54.982 --> 27:57.616
Yeah, it's a Mardi Gras
in my mouth.

27:58.785 --> 28:03.154
<i>The winner of the $500 gift card
and a limited run</i>

28:03.190 --> 28:08.860
<i>of their flavour put into
production next month is...</i>

28:08.896 --> 28:10.362
strawberry bourbon blast.

28:14.668 --> 28:17.402
Way to go, congratulations.

28:17.437 --> 28:19.971
<i>Let's hear it
for our guest judge!</i>

28:22.009 --> 28:24.676
Judging from what I saw, Kat
and Charlie's is too risky.

28:24.711 --> 28:26.222
Their books show a major shift
in earnings

28:26.246 --> 28:27.379
over the last quarter,

28:27.414 --> 28:29.814
their financial projections
for next year are way off.

28:29.850 --> 28:32.551
Judging from what I saw
they're inventive, fun,

28:32.586 --> 28:34.230
they have great product,
and it's a company

28:34.254 --> 28:36.254
that Everson Valley Farms
can really take places.

28:36.290 --> 28:38.723
I like the idea of bringing a
youthful element to the brand.

28:38.759 --> 28:42.227
Mr. Everson, my mission is
to find you a money maker.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.663
A company that makes this place

28:44.698 --> 28:46.242
as strong as possible
before we go public...

28:46.266 --> 28:47.198
They have...

28:47.234 --> 28:48.066
This isn't it.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.434
A delicious product.

28:49.469 --> 28:50.335
That matters.

28:50.370 --> 28:51.269
She didn't even taste it.

28:51.305 --> 28:52.237
Books don't lie.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.550
Nothing great comes
without a little risk.

28:53.574 --> 28:55.707
Alright, this is
not a competition.

28:55.742 --> 28:58.343
You both make valid points.

28:58.378 --> 29:00.579
Cat and Charlie's seems like
a company to track

29:00.614 --> 29:04.115
but for right now let's put it
on the back burner

29:04.151 --> 29:05.151
and keep looking.

29:05.185 --> 29:07.686
We need a real game changer
for our portfolio

29:07.721 --> 29:09.921
that'll take us
to the next level.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.401
Now, we don't have
the luxury of time here.

29:11.425 --> 29:14.259
You two need to get
on the same page.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.427
Fast.

29:19.399 --> 29:21.099
Hi. I'm just meeting a friend.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.167
Thanks.

29:24.271 --> 29:26.972
Looks like the weekend
came just in time.

29:27.007 --> 29:28.106
You look exhausted.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.174
Yeah, I am.

29:29.209 --> 29:31.242
'Cause I'm working with someone
who's exhausting.

29:31.278 --> 29:33.979
Yeah, let's buy a kitschy little
ice cream shop

29:34.014 --> 29:35.425
and then guess who's left
holding the bag

29:35.449 --> 29:36.948
when it doesn't work out?

29:36.984 --> 29:39.918
So the search continues
I assume?

29:39.953 --> 29:41.953
I just feel like I got thrown
a real curve ball.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.756
In fact, I gotta
nip this in the bud.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.424
Anything from Reeltraveler?

29:46.460 --> 29:47.826
No.

29:47.861 --> 29:49.327
Not yet.

29:49.363 --> 29:51.129
It's probably for the best.

29:52.799 --> 29:54.966
There.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.171
Attached is all the data
from Monday's meeting

30:00.207 --> 30:01.940
with Harbor Coffeeworks.

30:01.975 --> 30:06.678
Please read all the files.

30:06.713 --> 30:09.648
You gotta be kidding me.

30:11.785 --> 30:13.184
You're relentless.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.986
Why am I even here?

30:37.377 --> 30:38.843
<i>Wanna chat?</i>

30:47.087 --> 30:50.021
How was my day?

30:50.057 --> 30:51.057
Better already.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.597
I have to.

30:58.632 --> 31:03.330
Reeltraveler, I've told you
that I'm single.

31:04.672 --> 31:10.475
May I assume that,
if you're writing me,

31:10.511 --> 31:12.778
you are too?

31:13.514 --> 31:15.480
<i>Yes, I am single.</i>

31:15.516 --> 31:20.118
<i>And in case you were wondering,
I'm 36.</i>

31:25.259 --> 31:27.393
He's 36. He's 36.

31:27.428 --> 31:30.028
Well, this just got interesting.

31:30.064 --> 31:30.996
<i>What are the odds?</i>

31:31.031 --> 31:32.597
<i>Me too.</i>

31:36.437 --> 31:37.602
OK.

31:37.638 --> 31:39.749
<i>I know we're not sharing
too much about our location</i>

31:39.773 --> 31:42.641
<i>or identities yet but I have
to ask...</i>

31:45.512 --> 31:47.379
<i>Where did you find my letter?</i>

31:47.414 --> 31:49.214
<i>I'm dying to know.</i>

31:52.953 --> 31:55.020
<i>On a beach in Maine.</i>

31:56.957 --> 31:58.557
Go figure.

31:58.592 --> 32:01.093
<i>Why don't you tell me more
about yourself?</i>

32:01.128 --> 32:03.328
<i>I just wanna hear
more about you.</i>

32:03.364 --> 32:04.396
Me too.

32:04.431 --> 32:05.431
<i>You first.</i>

32:05.466 --> 32:06.998
<i>I don't know where to start.</i>

32:07.034 --> 32:09.901
<i>I guess you could say
I'm someone</i>

32:09.937 --> 32:12.070
<i>who hasn't quite figured out
where home is yet.</i>

32:12.106 --> 32:13.538
<i>Home is Boston.</i>

32:13.574 --> 32:15.085
<i>My parents had me when
they were older, though,</i>

32:15.109 --> 32:16.341
<i>and now they're retired</i>

32:16.377 --> 32:19.711
<i>and living on the other side of
the country, which I hate.</i>

32:19.747 --> 32:22.914
<i>It makes me feel really
lonely sometimes.</i>

32:22.950 --> 32:24.216
<i>But I'm lucky.</i>

32:24.251 --> 32:27.719
<i>I have an aunt here in town
and I absolutely cherish her.</i>

32:27.755 --> 32:30.856
<i>I have always wondered what it
would be like to have a sister.</i>

32:30.891 --> 32:32.257
<i>I know I would have loved it.</i>

32:32.292 --> 32:33.759
<i>I got lucky.</i>

32:33.794 --> 32:36.294
<i>I have one and she's a gem.</i>

32:36.330 --> 32:38.029
<i>What's been your favourite trip?</i>

32:38.065 --> 32:40.232
<i>Fly fishing in Patagonia.</i>

32:40.267 --> 32:41.333
<i>You?</i>

32:41.368 --> 32:43.702
<i>The aunt I told you about,
she took me to Paris</i>

32:43.737 --> 32:46.138
<i>for a week after I graduated
from high school.</i>

32:46.173 --> 32:47.906
<i>I'll never forget it.</i>

32:47.941 --> 32:48.941
Checkmate!

32:50.277 --> 32:51.476
<i>I can knit.</i>

32:51.512 --> 32:53.912
<i>My mom taught me.</i>

32:53.947 --> 32:56.148
<i>I'm crazy about dogs.</i>

32:56.183 --> 32:58.083
<i>It kills me not to have one.</i>

32:58.118 --> 32:58.884
<i>But it doesn't make sense</i>

32:58.919 --> 33:00.152
<i>for me to have one right now.</i>

33:00.187 --> 33:01.420
<i>I get it.</i>

33:01.455 --> 33:03.655
<i>I can't wait to have one.</i>

33:03.690 --> 33:07.058
<i>And I want it to be
an older dog.</i>

33:07.094 --> 33:09.561
<i>When I see those
faces at a shelter,</i>

33:09.596 --> 33:11.930
<i>the ones with the sprays
of white on their muzzles,</i>

33:11.965 --> 33:13.465
<i>they're so beautiful.</i>

33:13.500 --> 33:15.233
<i>I just know they have
a story to tell</i>

33:15.269 --> 33:19.638
<i>and you could see how much they
would love to be loved again.</i>

33:19.673 --> 33:23.675
I can't believe it's Sunday
night already.

33:23.710 --> 33:29.147
Talking to you has made
the weekend fly right by.

33:29.183 --> 33:31.483
<i>Honestly, the idea of going
to work tomorrow</i>

33:31.518 --> 33:33.251
<i>doesn't exactly thrill me.</i>

33:33.287 --> 33:35.187
<i>The project I'm working on...</i>

33:35.222 --> 33:38.523
<i>well, there's a co-worker
I'm having trouble with.</i>

33:38.559 --> 33:39.858
<i>A real know-it-all.</i>

33:39.893 --> 33:41.626
<i>Incredibly stubborn.</i>

33:41.662 --> 33:42.994
I know the type.

33:43.030 --> 33:44.429
<i>But if I were to be
truly honest,</i>

33:44.465 --> 33:46.198
<i>my problem isn't
with my co-worker,</i>

33:46.233 --> 33:47.199
<i>it's with my boss.</i>

33:47.234 --> 33:49.501
<i>I want him to know
how much I respect him.</i>

33:49.536 --> 33:53.238
<i>We just see things differently.</i>

33:57.478 --> 34:00.946
I can give advice but I'm
afraid it's going to be blunt.

34:00.981 --> 34:02.180
<i>Give it to me.</i>

34:02.216 --> 34:06.952
At the end of the day, you are
there to do the job at hand.

34:06.987 --> 34:09.120
Are you getting it done?

34:09.156 --> 34:13.291
<i>Ask yourself have you really
given it your all?</i>

34:13.327 --> 34:18.295
If you have, then unfortunately
there's nothing more

34:18.331 --> 34:20.065
<i>that you can do, really.</i>

34:20.100 --> 34:24.803
But if not, then that's on you.

34:24.838 --> 34:28.139
So, Reeltraveler, which is it?

34:31.043 --> 34:33.245
So we just went back and forth
all weekend

34:33.280 --> 34:34.324
and he's so easy to talk to.

34:34.348 --> 34:36.848
I just feel like I can open
up to him, you know?

34:36.884 --> 34:37.949
See?

34:37.985 --> 34:40.185
Good things happen when
you're willing to go for it.

34:43.422 --> 34:45.556
Well, I like the look of this.

34:46.527 --> 34:47.527
I'm settling in.

34:48.629 --> 34:50.672
I actually got some advice
from a friend over the weekend

34:50.697 --> 34:53.098
and I'm taking it.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.400
It was someone I met, actually.

34:55.435 --> 34:56.268
What?

34:56.303 --> 34:58.103
You met someone?
You have to tell me.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.138
No, no, no.

34:59.172 --> 35:01.017
I just... it's too early
to even say anything yet.

35:01.041 --> 35:03.408
We're just emailing,
online chats, you know.

35:03.443 --> 35:05.710
Shocking.

35:05.746 --> 35:07.712
You're using the internet.

35:07.748 --> 35:09.514
I know how to use the internet.

35:09.550 --> 35:11.194
I haven't been living
in the woods that long.

35:11.218 --> 35:15.053
It's been a while.

35:15.088 --> 35:19.958
It's just we... had this
instant connection.

35:19.993 --> 35:20.926
She's open.

35:20.961 --> 35:22.027
She's engaging.

35:22.062 --> 35:24.296
She's passionate about things.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.031
I like the sound of her already.

35:26.066 --> 35:27.977
I actually stayed up half
the night working on this

35:28.001 --> 35:31.036
Harbor Coffeeworks meeting
and today Abbey Lawrence

35:31.071 --> 35:32.437
isn't gonna know what hit her.

35:33.774 --> 35:34.906
Yeah, I'm even early.

35:34.942 --> 35:36.308
You are, actually.

35:36.343 --> 35:41.580
Speaking of which,
have you seen her?

35:41.615 --> 35:43.715
I'm supposed to meet her
in the lobby.

35:47.921 --> 35:48.987
Hey! Yeah.

35:49.022 --> 35:51.156
I swear, I was on time.

35:51.191 --> 35:53.091
I've been here for hours,
actually.

35:53.126 --> 35:54.893
But I was in the office.

35:54.928 --> 35:57.796
Well, on time usually means
being in the agreed upon spot,

35:57.831 --> 35:58.997
not just in the building.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.098
Just tell me you're ready.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.511
Harbor Coffeeworks is exactly
the kind of company

36:01.535 --> 36:02.334
we're looking for.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.413
Yeah, started small,
steady growth,

36:03.437 --> 36:05.604
great numbers, they source
their beans exclusively

36:05.639 --> 36:07.806
from a farm in Indonesia
that grows in volcanic soil.

36:07.841 --> 36:08.640
I'm impressed.

36:08.675 --> 36:09.474
You actually did
do your research.

36:09.509 --> 36:10.553
But we're not the only game
in town

36:10.577 --> 36:13.445
and we have to convince
Stan Tucker to sell to us.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.646
No problem.

36:14.681 --> 36:16.481
I will follow your lead.

36:17.184 --> 36:18.249
We'll go straight, right?

36:18.285 --> 36:20.151
The car's over here?

36:24.157 --> 36:25.123
Thanks, Stan.

36:25.158 --> 36:27.459
You got 'er.

36:27.494 --> 36:28.526
Thank you.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.795
My pleasure.

36:30.831 --> 36:33.431
Harbor Coffeeworks is built
off my impeccable taste

36:33.467 --> 36:34.799
and good judgement.

36:34.835 --> 36:36.479
I don't plan on letting
them go too easily.

36:36.503 --> 36:38.336
After last week's article
in the Globe,

36:38.372 --> 36:41.339
naming us hands down
the best coffee in Boston,

36:41.375 --> 36:42.518
let's just say there's been
a lot of interest.

36:42.542 --> 36:44.621
As well there should be,
but I would like to point out

36:44.645 --> 36:45.955
that this meeting has been
on the books

36:45.979 --> 36:47.212
for the last three months.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.881
We saw what you had here well
before that article came out.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.282
You did.

36:51.318 --> 36:52.684
I like that.

36:52.719 --> 36:54.653
But why should I sell over
to Everson so easily

36:54.688 --> 36:55.887
and so early on?

36:55.922 --> 36:58.490
Why don't I just sit back and
wait for the highest bidder?

36:58.525 --> 37:00.358
Do you mind if I take this one,
Abbey?

37:00.394 --> 37:01.459
Sure.

37:01.495 --> 37:02.495
Thank you.

37:04.631 --> 37:07.032
Stan, I did my research and I
know this all started with you

37:07.067 --> 37:09.012
pushing a coffee cart around
a mall with your best friend,

37:09.036 --> 37:10.235
Bernie Cranford.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.005
And I also know that Bernie took
the investor that you found,

37:14.041 --> 37:17.375
along with your original blend,
and he started Bernie's Brews.

37:17.411 --> 37:19.344
But that didn't stop you.

37:19.379 --> 37:20.612
No.

37:20.647 --> 37:22.992
No, I started over again on my
own and developed a new blend.

37:23.016 --> 37:25.050
A better blend, and
I built all of this.

37:25.085 --> 37:27.519
And now Harbor Coffeeworks
is Bernie's Brews number one

37:27.554 --> 37:29.154
competitor in the north east.

37:29.189 --> 37:29.988
That's why...

37:30.023 --> 37:31.923
We can make you go national,
fast.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.670
Our Aunt Betsy's Breakfast
Boutiques are opening up

37:33.694 --> 37:35.427
in every major city
across the country.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.996
Picture Bernie's face
when he gets off an airplane

37:38.031 --> 37:41.933
in California and he sees Aunt
Betsy's Breakfast Boutiques

37:41.968 --> 37:46.504
now featuring Boston's
Harbor Coffeeworks.

37:46.540 --> 37:47.572
Keep talking.

37:47.607 --> 37:49.874
You can sit here and wait
for offer after offer

37:49.910 --> 37:52.877
because you've created
something special, Stan.

37:52.913 --> 37:56.881
Or you can join the Everson
Valley Farms family

37:56.917 --> 38:02.187
and have the future of Harbor
Coffeeworks start now.

38:08.929 --> 38:09.961
Alright.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.464
Let's do this.

38:13.734 --> 38:15.700
OK, Stan.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.147
This is gonna be
the best decision

38:18.171 --> 38:19.571
that you have ever made.

38:19.606 --> 38:21.539
Yeah, I hope so.

38:21.575 --> 38:24.809
I can't help but notice,
it's a great photo.

38:24.845 --> 38:26.111
Yeah, thank you very much.

38:26.146 --> 38:27.078
That's very sweet.

38:27.114 --> 38:30.148
Who doesn't like an
ugly sweater party, huh?

38:30.183 --> 38:31.223
What do you mean?

38:31.918 --> 38:32.970
What do you mean?

38:38.458 --> 38:39.936
- He's kidding.
- I meant... yeah, no...

38:39.960 --> 38:41.059
He has terrible taste.

38:41.094 --> 38:43.428
Awfully, it looks like an
awfully expensive sweater.

38:43.463 --> 38:45.130
It just looks very fancy.

38:45.165 --> 38:47.132
It's like a very fancy sweater.

38:47.167 --> 38:49.901
I just... she's got
beautiful long hair, too.

38:49.936 --> 38:51.736
This meeting is over.

38:58.445 --> 38:59.678
That was Stan Tucker.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.247
The offer is officially
declined.

39:02.282 --> 39:05.250
Sir, Stan is a temperamental
man and I think that

39:05.285 --> 39:07.130
if we give him a little time
we could circle back.

39:07.154 --> 39:08.853
We don't have time
to circle back.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.855
The Harbor Coffeeworks
deal is dead.

39:10.891 --> 39:14.125
How could I have known that
his wife had such bad taste?

39:16.029 --> 39:17.262
I'm sorry.

39:17.297 --> 39:21.132
I don't understand.

39:21.168 --> 39:22.534
You know how to do this, Nick.

39:22.569 --> 39:23.935
Sir, actually Nick gave...

39:23.971 --> 39:26.638
You don't need to explain,
Abbey.

39:26.673 --> 39:29.674
Maybe my expectations
were too high.

39:36.149 --> 39:37.149
Let's start over.

39:37.184 --> 39:39.184
We really don't know anything
about each other

39:39.219 --> 39:43.788
except I can see you have
some tension with your father.

39:43.824 --> 39:48.159
Yeah, he wants me to follow
in his footsteps.

39:48.195 --> 39:53.231
It's great for Soph,
she loves it.

39:53.266 --> 39:56.201
But it's not you.

39:56.236 --> 39:57.747
The Everson Valley Farms
that I fell in love with,

39:57.771 --> 39:59.638
it wasn't a corporation.

39:59.673 --> 40:03.575
It was my grandfather's farm,
you know?

40:03.610 --> 40:08.213
A place I'd spend my summers
working outside with my hands.

40:08.248 --> 40:09.414
Yeah.

40:09.449 --> 40:13.518
I just... I don't speak his
language like you and Soph.

40:13.553 --> 40:16.221
I wish I had what you have.

40:16.256 --> 40:19.090
You can just walk into a room
and be spontaneous.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.692
You're so open.

40:20.727 --> 40:23.161
I don't like to be spontaneous.

40:23.196 --> 40:24.429
I don't know how.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.164
I never would have guessed that.

40:26.199 --> 40:27.199
Yeah, yeah.

40:27.234 --> 40:28.234
I'm working on it.

40:30.370 --> 40:32.003
Thank you.

40:34.775 --> 40:37.108
Wanna be spontaneous right now?

40:38.211 --> 40:39.678
Come on.

40:41.782 --> 40:43.381
Hey, little buddy.

40:44.551 --> 40:45.684
This was such a good idea.

40:45.719 --> 40:46.885
<i>Ah, dogs.</i>

40:46.920 --> 40:48.353
<i>An instant mood changer.</i>

40:48.388 --> 40:49.732
If you could take home
one of these today

40:49.756 --> 40:51.756
which one would you take?

40:54.561 --> 40:56.795
I think I'd take this
one home right here.

40:56.830 --> 40:57.762
Yeah?

40:57.798 --> 40:58.697
You'd take an old dog?

40:58.732 --> 41:01.633
I think everybody deserves
a second chance.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.835
Don't you?

41:07.674 --> 41:11.443
You know, at first I...

41:11.478 --> 41:14.713
I felt forced into this.

41:14.748 --> 41:17.916
But helping grow
the family business,

41:17.951 --> 41:19.818
it's important to me.

41:19.853 --> 41:23.888
I think if we're gonna do this
let's go big.

41:23.924 --> 41:27.959
Let's do it right.

41:27.994 --> 41:30.929
I have an idea.

41:30.964 --> 41:32.063
Wilmore Estates.

41:32.099 --> 41:36.234
It's a cidery, orchard and inn
with huge possibilities

41:36.269 --> 41:38.803
for expansion and the owner,
George Wilmore,

41:38.839 --> 41:40.049
is notorious for refusing
to sell,

41:40.073 --> 41:42.674
which is why I took it off the
list because we just don't have

41:42.709 --> 41:45.510
enough time and I was trying
to be conservative.

41:45.545 --> 41:46.444
But I have to be honest,

41:46.480 --> 41:51.516
I've had my eye on this place
for years.

41:51.551 --> 41:52.951
This place looks incredible.

41:52.986 --> 41:54.018
I know.

41:54.054 --> 41:55.865
It's the ultimate get,
but we'd have to rearrange

41:55.889 --> 41:57.533
our whole schedule with all
the other prospects

41:57.557 --> 42:00.158
but you're inspiring me.

42:00.193 --> 42:04.596
I think we should go big.

42:04.631 --> 42:05.631
Let's go for it.

42:05.665 --> 42:07.132
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:07.167 --> 42:08.167
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:08.201 --> 42:09.834
OK.

42:12.806 --> 42:19.677
So here is a list of
all the other companies

42:19.713 --> 42:22.147
we have meetings with.

42:25.585 --> 42:29.687
You call them and I'll call
the Wilmore Estates.

42:29.723 --> 42:30.755
Done.

42:45.038 --> 42:46.404
Hey.

42:46.439 --> 42:47.972
You're looking upbeat.

42:48.008 --> 42:50.742
I thought the meeting at Harbor
Coffeeworks went badly.

42:50.777 --> 42:51.876
It did.

42:51.912 --> 42:53.077
It tanked.

42:53.113 --> 42:55.647
But we got our heads back
in the game

42:55.682 --> 43:00.552
and now we're going
after something big.

43:00.587 --> 43:04.022
Which makes me think...

43:04.057 --> 43:06.057
why not go big in other areas
of my life, too?

43:07.260 --> 43:12.764
Like with little miss internet?

43:12.799 --> 43:14.098
Maybe.

43:30.083 --> 43:31.583
Hi, this is Abbey Lawrence.

43:31.618 --> 43:33.518
I'm calling from Everson Farms

43:33.553 --> 43:35.887
and I'd like to make an
appointment with George Wilmore.

43:35.922 --> 43:37.889
Yes, I can hold.

43:45.966 --> 43:49.701
The project I've been working on
is here in Boston.

43:49.736 --> 43:51.569
<i>Should we meet?</i>

43:54.608 --> 43:59.811
This whole time he has been here
in Boston.

43:59.846 --> 44:00.945
That's good.

44:00.981 --> 44:01.813
I guess.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.047
I mean, it's kinda weird.

44:03.083 --> 44:04.282
I've been imagining this guy

44:04.317 --> 44:06.718
I've been getting to know who's
great and he lives in Maine.

44:07.988 --> 44:09.832
It's so much easier to open
up to somebody who's far away.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.122
It's... it's like... It's safe.

44:11.157 --> 44:12.056
Yeah.

44:12.092 --> 44:13.658
A bit of a fantasy.

44:13.693 --> 44:14.726
Trust me, sweetheart.

44:14.761 --> 44:15.660
This is better.

44:15.695 --> 44:16.928
This is exciting.

44:16.963 --> 44:17.929
This is real.

44:17.964 --> 44:19.731
Real is what I want.

44:25.505 --> 44:28.273
Yes, let's meet.

44:28.308 --> 44:29.440
Let's meet.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.150
Yes.

44:39.185 --> 44:40.852
Yes!

44:46.626 --> 44:47.592
<i>How's tomorrow?</i>

44:47.627 --> 44:48.493
Tomorrow?

44:48.528 --> 44:50.361
Yes!

44:50.397 --> 44:54.098
Tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow.

44:54.134 --> 44:58.169
Tomorrow it is.

45:07.515 --> 45:10.883
Yes, I'd like to make a
reservation for tonight, for 7:00.

45:10.918 --> 45:12.051
For two people.

45:12.086 --> 45:15.487
Name is Nick Everson.

45:15.523 --> 45:17.523
Alright, thank you.

45:17.558 --> 45:19.291
See you then.

45:23.030 --> 45:24.363
<i>How's 7:00 pm?</i>

45:24.398 --> 45:25.731
<i>Just off Cook Street.</i>

45:25.766 --> 45:27.399
<i>A little restaurant
called Luigi's.</i>

45:27.435 --> 45:29.702
I love that place.

46:08.709 --> 46:10.009
<i>Nick?</i>

46:10.044 --> 46:11.455
<i>Hey, before you go
on your big date</i>

46:11.479 --> 46:13.023
<i>I need Abbey's list of companies
I have to call?</i>

46:13.047 --> 46:14.813
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll...

46:15.750 --> 46:17.016
<i>Nick?</i>

46:18.285 --> 46:19.785
- The list?
- One second.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.320
Nicholas.

46:23.557 --> 46:24.590
Yeah-yeah.

46:24.993 --> 46:26.091
<i>Hello?</i>

46:26.127 --> 46:27.860
Hi, Nick.
It's Abbey.

46:27.895 --> 46:28.660
Listen, I just wanna
make sure you had

46:28.696 --> 46:30.696
that list of the companies
to call.

46:30.731 --> 46:31.775
It needs to be done tonight.

46:31.799 --> 46:33.410
Can you just give it to Sophie
and she'll do it?

46:33.434 --> 46:34.333
Yeah, yeah.

46:34.368 --> 46:37.336
I'm giving it to her right now.

46:45.813 --> 46:47.279
- Abbey.
- Yeah.

46:47.314 --> 46:48.781
It's you.

46:48.816 --> 46:49.915
Yes, it's me.

46:49.950 --> 46:51.917
- It's you.
- Yes, it's me, Abbey.

46:51.952 --> 46:53.552
The handwriting.

46:53.587 --> 46:54.987
It's the same as the letter.

46:55.022 --> 46:56.099
I don't know what's going on,
Nick,

46:56.123 --> 46:57.923
but I gotta go.

46:57.958 --> 46:59.258
Bye.

46:59.293 --> 47:00.826
Hello? Abbey.

47:00.861 --> 47:04.430
Nick, what is going on?

47:04.465 --> 47:07.499
Why does Abbey have stationary
with the initials ML on it?

47:07.535 --> 47:11.770
Her full name is
Mary Abigail Lawrence.

47:11.806 --> 47:14.506
Abbey is ML Beantown.

47:14.542 --> 47:15.574
What?

47:18.212 --> 47:19.745
Abbey is ML Beantown.

47:19.780 --> 47:20.891
She's the one that
I've been emailing.

47:20.915 --> 47:23.182
She's going to meet me at
the restaurant right now.

47:23.217 --> 47:25.417
She knows me as Reeltraveler175.

47:25.453 --> 47:26.596
It's too early.
It's gonna ruin everything!

47:26.620 --> 47:27.653
This can't happen!

47:27.688 --> 47:28.854
Nick!

47:28.889 --> 47:30.255
It's OK.

47:30.291 --> 47:31.723
Just calm down.

47:36.063 --> 47:38.764
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

47:38.799 --> 47:39.698
This is what I do know.

47:39.733 --> 47:42.468
I have never seen you
this happy before,

47:42.503 --> 47:46.472
so whatever it takes to keep
this woman, do it.

47:46.507 --> 47:50.676
Soph, I just... I need a minute
to process this right now.

48:02.556 --> 48:05.357
Yeah, you don't have a minute.

48:10.898 --> 48:13.866
<i>Dear ML Beantown,
something's come up tonight</i>

48:13.901 --> 48:15.634
<i>and I can't meet you.</i>

48:15.669 --> 48:18.437
<i>My sincerest apologies.</i>

48:22.943 --> 48:24.877
I believe that there are more
layers to people

48:24.912 --> 48:27.346
than we ever imagined.

48:31.085 --> 48:33.185
Is this really Abbey?

48:33.220 --> 48:37.556
I can't believe I just
left you standing there.

48:51.305 --> 48:52.704
Blocked.

49:03.951 --> 49:09.855
<i>ML Beantown, I feel so terrible
about last night</i>

49:09.890 --> 49:15.327
<i>and more than anything I want
to apologize and explain.</i>

49:18.499 --> 49:20.165
She blocked me.

49:28.976 --> 49:30.609
- Hi.
- Hey.

49:30.644 --> 49:33.212
I brought you a little coffee...

49:33.247 --> 49:36.882
a doughnut with some sprinkles
on it.

49:36.917 --> 49:38.884
That's... thoughtful.

49:38.919 --> 49:40.430
Yeah, well you've been holed up
in here all morning,

49:40.454 --> 49:41.965
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

49:41.989 --> 49:43.555
Are you OK? You alright?

49:43.591 --> 49:46.792
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

49:46.827 --> 49:49.661
You should know George
Wilmore passed on the meeting.

49:49.697 --> 49:52.331
I couldn't really get past
the front office.

49:52.366 --> 49:54.077
I don't know why I let myself
get distracted with it.

49:54.101 --> 49:55.067
I'm sorry.

49:55.102 --> 49:56.313
You know, you put yourself
out there and you...

49:56.337 --> 49:59.605
you get your hopes up and then
you just get disappointed so...

49:59.640 --> 50:03.675
this is what we're gonna do.

50:03.711 --> 50:04.509
Smith's Oatmeal.

50:04.545 --> 50:06.812
It's a small company,
tiny actually,

50:06.847 --> 50:08.981
but it fits with our brand
and we can sweep in

50:09.016 --> 50:10.482
and just scoop them right up.

50:10.517 --> 50:13.485
What happened to going big?

50:13.520 --> 50:14.453
Wowing?

50:14.488 --> 50:15.565
We don't have time
and I don't want to try

50:15.589 --> 50:18.991
for something bigger and
then end up with nothing.

50:22.196 --> 50:24.930
Are you giving up?

50:24.965 --> 50:27.499
This may not be big enough
to wow your father

50:27.534 --> 50:31.770
or warrant a promotion but it is
an addition to the portfolio.

50:31.805 --> 50:33.705
It's something.

50:33.741 --> 50:36.174
And that's better than nothing.

50:40.180 --> 50:41.513
OK.

50:59.900 --> 51:01.300
OK.

51:11.245 --> 51:14.479
Owner of Wilmore Estates,

51:14.515 --> 51:17.816
George Wilmore shares his five
favourite fishing spots.

51:17.851 --> 51:22.721
His favourite being in his own
backyard at his cidery and inn.

51:36.337 --> 51:37.302
I need you to go home.

51:37.338 --> 51:38.303
Start prepping.

51:38.339 --> 51:39.171
For what?

51:39.206 --> 51:40.972
I'm picking you up early
tomorrow morning

51:41.008 --> 51:43.475
and we're heading
to Wilmore Estates.

51:43.510 --> 51:44.554
Bring an overnight bag
just in case.

51:44.578 --> 51:46.511
I told you George Wilmore
doesn't want to sell.

51:46.547 --> 51:49.448
- It's impossible.
- It's not that impossible.

51:49.483 --> 51:52.150
I put my feelers out there,
spoke to a few friends,

51:52.186 --> 51:54.619
and I was put in touch with
somebody who works for him.

51:54.655 --> 51:55.655
Her name is Deirdre.

51:55.689 --> 51:56.722
Deirdre who?

51:56.757 --> 51:58.001
I'll have a whole bio written up
for you tomorrow,

51:58.025 --> 51:59.069
you can read it in the car.

51:59.093 --> 52:00.737
The whole point is, is we're
meeting her at 10:00

52:00.761 --> 52:03.161
and then we're meeting him.

52:03.197 --> 52:04.341
I can't believe
you got a meeting.

52:04.365 --> 52:05.731
I couldn't even get in the door.

52:05.766 --> 52:06.965
You know what?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.368
Honestly, it doesn't matter
because Wilmore's gonna say no.

52:09.403 --> 52:11.002
This is probably a huge
waste of time.

52:11.038 --> 52:12.971
OK, look.

52:13.006 --> 52:14.384
I know we don't know
each other too well

52:14.408 --> 52:15.585
and hopefully I'm not crossing
a line here

52:15.609 --> 52:17.309
but you were all
dressed up yesterday

52:17.344 --> 52:18.910
and today you're upset.

52:18.946 --> 52:21.980
Did you have a bad date?

52:22.015 --> 52:23.815
Unbelievable.
You guys are all the same.

52:23.851 --> 52:24.861
You know, you see a woman upset

52:24.885 --> 52:26.262
and you automatically assume
it's about a guy.

52:26.286 --> 52:27.664
You know, it's not
always about you.

52:27.688 --> 52:29.321
It's not about a guy?

52:29.356 --> 52:32.657
It's... it is this time,

52:32.693 --> 52:34.826
but it's just annoying
that you would assume that.

52:34.862 --> 52:36.995
Well, you should forget
that guy.

52:37.030 --> 52:40.031
Look, we have an opportunity
to meet George Wilmore.

52:40.067 --> 52:43.602
The Abbey Lawrence that I know
would not walk away from that.

52:43.637 --> 52:46.171
And read all the files, OK?

52:46.206 --> 52:47.217
If we're gonna work together

52:47.241 --> 52:49.174
I need you to be fully prepared
and up to speed.

52:52.646 --> 52:53.857
Yeah, suddenly he's leading
the charge,

52:53.881 --> 52:56.848
he's taking initiative, he's
actually got us this meeting.

52:56.884 --> 52:58.395
Sounds like he has a lot more
going for him

52:58.419 --> 52:59.184
than you first thought.

52:59.219 --> 53:00.018
Yeah, I don't know.

53:00.053 --> 53:02.087
If my experience
with Reeltraveler

53:02.122 --> 53:04.589
is of any indication I'm not
a great judge of character.

53:04.625 --> 53:05.791
You don't know for sure.

53:05.826 --> 53:07.426
Something could have happened.

53:07.461 --> 53:12.597
But you'll never know
because you blocked him.

53:12.633 --> 53:15.066
Is this fancy cheese
or just mould?

53:58.712 --> 54:02.347
<i>Reeltraveler, I was hurt when
you didn't show up for our date.</i>

54:02.382 --> 54:04.516
<i>My first instinct
was to block you.</i>

54:14.828 --> 54:20.965
Well, I look forward to telling
you everything in person.

54:21.401 --> 54:24.302
<i>For now, please know that I
feel awful to have hurt you.</i>

54:24.338 --> 54:25.815
<i>It's not that I didn't want
to see you,</i>

54:25.839 --> 54:29.074
<i>it's just... I'm still
working it out.</i>

54:41.922 --> 54:42.687
Good morning.

54:42.723 --> 54:44.022
Hi.
Is Abbey...

54:44.057 --> 54:47.025
No, no, no, no, no.
You're in the right place, Nick.

54:47.060 --> 54:47.993
Come on.

54:48.028 --> 54:49.060
Come right in.

54:49.096 --> 54:49.995
Hi.

54:50.030 --> 54:50.896
Hey, Aunt Francis.

54:50.931 --> 54:52.130
What're you doing here?

54:52.165 --> 54:53.476
Well, you gave me a key
last Christmas.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.966
Did you sleep over?

54:55.002 --> 54:56.735
The key was for emergencies.

54:56.770 --> 54:57.836
This is an emergency.

54:57.871 --> 55:00.005
I needed to check out the guy
that's taking my niece

55:00.040 --> 55:01.573
on a road trip.

55:01.608 --> 55:03.975
Well, I'm the guy.

55:04.011 --> 55:06.678
Hi, I'm Nick Everson.

55:06.713 --> 55:08.780
No, please, I'm a hugger.

55:09.616 --> 55:13.051
Aunt Francis, I have heard
wonderful things.

55:13.086 --> 55:14.653
Thank you.

55:14.688 --> 55:15.887
I like him.

55:15.923 --> 55:17.355
OK, bye.

55:17.391 --> 55:19.090
I mapped out our whole...
thank you.

55:19.126 --> 55:21.493
I mapped out our trip
on this travel app...

55:21.528 --> 55:23.862
We're actually going
to make a stop on the way.

55:24.598 --> 55:26.331
Yeah, don't worry about it.

55:26.366 --> 55:28.344
I've already arranged that
we're gonna meet Deirdre

55:28.368 --> 55:30.769
an hour later.

55:30.804 --> 55:33.038
I got it all worked out.

55:38.211 --> 55:39.544
Buh-bye.

55:50.390 --> 55:52.402
You're having a really difficult
time with this stop, aren't you?

55:52.426 --> 55:53.770
No, I'm fine, I'm fine,
I like diners.

55:53.794 --> 55:55.026
It's all fine.

55:58.632 --> 56:00.143
I mean, I do like to know
what's going on.

56:00.167 --> 56:02.111
I'm not sure why you didn't
just tell me we had a stop.

56:02.135 --> 56:05.370
I could have planned that
but that's fine.

56:05.405 --> 56:08.239
You never told me who
this Dee-Deirdre-Deirdre.

56:08.275 --> 56:09.474
- Deirdre?
- Deirdre.

56:09.509 --> 56:10.875
- Deirdry?
- Deirdre.

56:10.911 --> 56:12.578
- Deirdre.
- Dra.

56:14.781 --> 56:16.147
It doesn't matter.
Who is she?

56:16.183 --> 56:17.315
Trust me.

56:17.351 --> 56:18.917
Trust me.
You just said that.

56:18.952 --> 56:20.496
You said that a second ago
when you ordered for me.

56:20.520 --> 56:21.764
You ordered a number two
on the menu,

56:21.788 --> 56:22.999
which I don't even know
what that is...

56:23.023 --> 56:24.133
It's the best thing on the menu.

56:24.157 --> 56:25.557
But I don't know what it is.

56:25.592 --> 56:27.136
No, it doesn't matter
if you know what it is.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.438
How are you just gonna
steamroll over me

56:28.462 --> 56:29.739
when you don't even
know what I like?

56:29.763 --> 56:31.296
Pancakes!

56:31.331 --> 56:32.831
Thank you.

56:32.866 --> 56:35.333
These look so good.

56:35.369 --> 56:39.104
Maybe this wasn't such
a bad idea after all.

56:39.139 --> 56:40.605
That's beautiful.

56:40.641 --> 56:42.307
Look how good that looks.

56:42.342 --> 56:43.108
Yeah.

56:43.143 --> 56:45.443
Oh, man.

56:45.479 --> 56:49.914
You know, I really do love to
get out of the city sometimes.

56:56.289 --> 56:59.090
Did I tell you I have a thing
for pancakes?

57:03.897 --> 57:04.974
Here are the keys to your rooms.

57:04.998 --> 57:06.776
Let me know if there's
anything else we can help with.

57:06.800 --> 57:11.469
Thank you so much, Deirdre,
I really appreciate it.

57:14.975 --> 57:15.907
It's beautiful here.

57:15.942 --> 57:18.209
Is that the...
that's not the Deirdre...

57:18.245 --> 57:21.212
that's not our contact
that we're meeting, right?

57:21.248 --> 57:22.647
Yeah.

57:22.683 --> 57:25.817
She works for Wilmore,
and we just met her.

57:25.852 --> 57:26.651
Here's your room key.

57:26.687 --> 57:28.753
What about Wilmore?

57:31.591 --> 57:33.169
There's no meeting with Wilmore,
is there?

57:33.193 --> 57:36.661
I promise you we are
meeting Wilmore.

57:36.697 --> 57:40.031
He just... doesn't know it yet.

57:40.067 --> 57:40.999
I knew it!

57:41.034 --> 57:42.679
I knew you couldn't get
a meeting that fast!

57:42.703 --> 57:44.669
How could you just drag me
all the way out here?

57:44.705 --> 57:46.705
You told me yourself,
you're not spontaneous.

57:46.740 --> 57:48.551
If I would have told you that
we were driving up here

57:48.575 --> 57:49.607
and just winging it

57:49.643 --> 57:51.543
there's no way you would have
gotten in the car.

57:52.412 --> 57:54.913
Just have a little faith,
alright?

57:54.948 --> 57:57.549
Think of it as an adventure.

57:57.584 --> 57:58.850
Here.

57:58.885 --> 58:00.329
- You're gonna need those.
- What is this?

58:00.353 --> 58:02.053
Meet me in the lobby
in 20 minutes, OK?

58:02.089 --> 58:04.856
What is this?

58:04.891 --> 58:06.057
OK.

58:16.970 --> 58:19.838
I hope there's a good reason
for this.

58:19.873 --> 58:21.673
Well, if you're gonna
meet someone

58:21.708 --> 58:24.008
it helps to know
where they're gonna be.

58:27.881 --> 58:29.414
OK, you coming?

58:34.654 --> 58:37.689
It's just beautiful out here.

58:40.794 --> 58:42.727
This could be it.

58:42.763 --> 58:45.330
This is the third spot
we've tried.

58:45.365 --> 58:48.466
Yeah, well the article said he
goes fishing on his property,

58:48.502 --> 58:50.335
not where on his property.

58:50.370 --> 58:51.948
Well, this is business,
that's what I told you,

58:51.972 --> 58:53.905
we have to plan.

58:56.877 --> 58:58.643
What?

58:58.678 --> 59:00.245
There he is.

59:02.182 --> 59:04.149
Here's the plan.

59:04.184 --> 59:06.050
We have no plan.

59:16.997 --> 59:17.862
Hey!

59:17.898 --> 59:19.697
Didn't realize somebody else
was here.

59:19.733 --> 59:22.133
It's mine.

59:22.169 --> 59:23.535
- I'm Nick.
- Hey.

59:23.570 --> 59:24.769
And this is Abbey.

59:24.805 --> 59:25.904
Hi.

59:28.542 --> 59:29.874
Yeah, she lost the coin toss.

59:29.910 --> 59:30.910
That's right.

59:31.278 --> 59:32.944
OK, but as soon as
you catch your fish

59:32.979 --> 59:34.813
I want us to go out
to the orchards, right?

59:34.848 --> 59:35.713
We're gonna go check it out.

59:35.749 --> 59:36.815
Yeah, deal.

59:36.850 --> 59:38.294
We're gonna go to a tasting,
I want to see all that.

59:38.318 --> 59:39.450
Yeah, deal. Deal?

59:39.486 --> 59:41.052
- Deal.
- Deal.

59:41.087 --> 59:43.621
So, you're gonna keep
your elbow high,

59:43.657 --> 59:45.056
don't break your wrist.

59:45.091 --> 59:46.624
OK. So...

59:46.660 --> 59:49.060
Not a lot of movement
in your wrist.

59:49.095 --> 59:50.406
Hope we're not distracting you
too much.

59:50.430 --> 59:51.529
No, it's fine,

59:51.565 --> 59:55.400
I'm enjoying watching
the two of you, actually.

59:55.836 --> 59:57.836
Pull it up, pull that line out.

59:57.871 --> 59:59.170
- Yeah.
- OK.

59:59.206 --> 01:00:01.673
Like flicking paint on a wall.

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:02.941
This is it?
This is so easy.

01:00:02.976 --> 01:00:04.253
Alright, yeah.
That's pretty good.

01:00:04.277 --> 01:00:05.288
It's not... it's not easy.

01:00:05.312 --> 01:00:06.211
Yeah, you know, he's right.

01:00:06.246 --> 01:00:08.113
It does take a lot of practice.

01:00:08.148 --> 01:00:09.180
Wait. Yeah.

01:00:09.216 --> 01:00:10.281
Oh my gosh!

01:00:10.317 --> 01:00:11.149
- You do have something.
- I totally have something!

01:00:11.184 --> 01:00:12.695
- You do have something!
- I have a fish.

01:00:12.719 --> 01:00:13.919
Lock your reel.
Lock your reel.

01:00:13.954 --> 01:00:15.153
Oh my gosh!

01:00:15.188 --> 01:00:16.621
Reel it in!

01:00:16.657 --> 01:00:17.657
Oh gosh.

01:00:19.326 --> 01:00:20.326
Look at that!

01:00:21.328 --> 01:00:22.994
Look at the size of it!

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:24.162
It's a big one, too!

01:00:24.197 --> 01:00:26.131
Talk about beginner's luck!

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:27.866
I never seen anything like it!

01:00:27.901 --> 01:00:29.200
I'm gonna set this guy free.

01:00:29.236 --> 01:00:30.268
Alright.

01:00:32.939 --> 01:00:33.872
We caught a fish!

01:00:33.907 --> 01:00:35.573
You caught your fish!

01:00:35.609 --> 01:00:36.841
OK, let's go.

01:00:36.877 --> 01:00:38.009
You caught your fish.

01:00:38.045 --> 01:00:39.322
I should catch a fish, too,
right.

01:00:39.346 --> 01:00:40.723
The deal was to catch
a fish and then...

01:00:40.747 --> 01:00:42.825
- We're already out here.
- I want to go taste the cider.

01:00:42.849 --> 01:00:43.682
Listen, you two.

01:00:43.717 --> 01:00:46.384
Please, you're scaring
all the fish.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.988
Just go to the cidery, please.

01:00:50.023 --> 01:00:51.156
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:00:51.191 --> 01:00:53.525
- Sorry.
- Sorry about that.

01:00:57.297 --> 01:00:58.596
Wait.

01:00:58.632 --> 01:01:00.832
I'm George Wilmore.

01:01:00.867 --> 01:01:02.767
If you promise to go
to the cidery

01:01:02.803 --> 01:01:04.869
I'll take you both
on a personal tour

01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:10.508
if you just go and let me fish
for an hour of peace and quiet.

01:01:10.544 --> 01:01:11.676
- Of cour...
- OK.

01:01:11.712 --> 01:01:12.944
Absolutely. Of course.

01:01:12.979 --> 01:01:13.845
Gee. Thank you so much.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.746
I'll see you in an hour.

01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:15.547
OK.

01:01:15.582 --> 01:01:16.648
Peace and quiet.

01:01:16.683 --> 01:01:18.763
- Sorry. We're not even here.
- We're not here, yeah.

01:01:20.654 --> 01:01:24.089
After the harvest we ferment
from anywhere form four weeks

01:01:24.124 --> 01:01:27.726
to several months
depending on the type of cider.

01:01:27.761 --> 01:01:29.461
We keep the temperature
at a constant,

01:01:29.496 --> 01:01:31.930
that's critical, and
if you come this way

01:01:31.965 --> 01:01:33.531
I can show you
another little secret.

01:01:33.567 --> 01:01:37.635
So we have two regular ciders
and five of the hard ciders,

01:01:37.671 --> 01:01:39.871
but we're always changing
things up.

01:01:39.906 --> 01:01:43.942
I look at cider making the way
wine makers approach wine.

01:01:43.977 --> 01:01:45.243
Here's a few of our newer,

01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:47.979
harder ciders if you care
for a taste.

01:01:48.014 --> 01:01:49.280
Yes, absolutely.

01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:51.216
Thank you.

01:01:53.954 --> 01:01:57.789
Is that pineapple I'm tasting?

01:01:57.824 --> 01:01:59.891
No?

01:01:59.926 --> 01:02:00.725
Oh, no.

01:02:00.761 --> 01:02:02.293
I believe that's orange, right?

01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:03.895
Very perceptive.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:04.863
Thank you so much.

01:02:04.898 --> 01:02:06.008
I can't thank you enough
for taking the time

01:02:06.032 --> 01:02:08.933
to show us around the property.

01:02:08.969 --> 01:02:10.068
Actually, Mr. Wilmore,

01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:12.148
we have something we would like
to talk with you about.

01:02:12.172 --> 01:02:14.439
The two of you just enjoy
your time here.

01:02:14.474 --> 01:02:16.741
We're having the cidery's 30th
anniversary party tonight

01:02:16.777 --> 01:02:17.742
at the main house.

01:02:17.778 --> 01:02:19.978
Our friends and employees
will all be there.

01:02:20.013 --> 01:02:21.579
Let's talk then.

01:02:21.615 --> 01:02:23.081
Sure.
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:24.116
OK.

01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:26.151
But first, let me show you
the orchard itself.

01:02:26.186 --> 01:02:27.819
Right this way.

01:02:38.832 --> 01:02:40.431
This is it.

01:02:42.502 --> 01:02:45.270
This is amazing.

01:02:45.305 --> 01:02:48.106
It reminds me a lot of
my grandparent's farm.

01:02:48.141 --> 01:02:49.941
That was my favourite place
in the world.

01:02:49.976 --> 01:02:51.521
You've built something
really special here,

01:02:51.545 --> 01:02:52.510
Mr. Wilmore.

01:02:52.546 --> 01:02:54.145
Thank you.

01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:55.446
Yes, I have.

01:02:55.482 --> 01:02:56.859
And now I've got some business
to deal with

01:02:56.883 --> 01:02:59.450
- but you two enjoy the orchard.
- Oh, we will.

01:02:59.486 --> 01:03:01.030
- Thank you for everything.
- Yeah, thanks so much.

01:03:01.054 --> 01:03:02.153
It's been my pleasure.

01:03:02.189 --> 01:03:03.566
I'll see you two at the party
later tonight, alright?

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:05.056
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:07.025
Thank you.

01:03:12.566 --> 01:03:14.532
You know, we're only an hour
from the city.

01:03:14.568 --> 01:03:16.179
Families are coming here,
bringing their kids,

01:03:16.203 --> 01:03:17.302
going apple picking...

01:03:17.871 --> 01:03:20.004
Going for hay rides.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.472
We can expand on the fishing.

01:03:21.508 --> 01:03:23.641
We could build cabins
for extended stays

01:03:23.677 --> 01:03:25.210
and make this a wedding
destination.

01:03:25.245 --> 01:03:26.578
The possibilities are endless.

01:03:26.613 --> 01:03:29.814
Abbey, I mean...
you were right.

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.183
This place is special.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:38.189
I need the...
the land evaluation.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.327
Thank you.

01:03:42.362 --> 01:03:45.430
Looks like we're
pretty well all set.

01:03:45.465 --> 01:03:47.265
Now we just gotta convince him.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.668
I have been watching you here
and you seem different.

01:03:50.704 --> 01:03:52.704
This place really brings
something out in you.

01:03:52.739 --> 01:03:54.572
I think I'm a little
more relaxed.

01:03:54.608 --> 01:03:57.108
It reminds me of a time
when Everson Valley Farms

01:03:57.143 --> 01:04:02.547
was just a farm,
not a corporation.

01:04:02.582 --> 01:04:06.351
Well, you keep surprising me.

01:04:06.386 --> 01:04:11.022
You know, the other night...
when I was upset,

01:04:11.057 --> 01:04:13.524
I had a date and this guy
that I thought

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.228
I had a great connection with
just really let me down.

01:04:17.264 --> 01:04:19.864
And then you, somebody
who I didn't really trust,

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.734
are coming through
all of a sudden.

01:04:25.805 --> 01:04:28.273
You always do that.

01:04:28.308 --> 01:04:29.374
What?

01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:31.209
Arrange things.

01:04:31.244 --> 01:04:32.244
I do?

01:04:32.279 --> 01:04:34.245
I do.

01:04:35.148 --> 01:04:35.980
Yeah, you do.

01:04:36.016 --> 01:04:38.416
And if you don't wanna
do something,

01:04:38.451 --> 01:04:39.784
or you don't want
to go somewhere,

01:04:39.819 --> 01:04:40.785
you have the funniest quirk.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.453
You go...

01:04:42.489 --> 01:04:43.888
- Right there.
- Right there?

01:04:43.924 --> 01:04:44.924
Yeah.

01:04:45.692 --> 01:04:46.491
Yeah.

01:04:46.526 --> 01:04:47.926
Oh no.

01:04:51.364 --> 01:04:53.398
Well, we should probably
get ready for the party.

01:04:53.433 --> 01:04:55.433
Yeah.

01:04:55.468 --> 01:04:58.903
Hey, that guy that let you down.

01:04:58.939 --> 01:04:59.904
Yeah.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.107
You gonna talk to him again?

01:05:03.143 --> 01:05:04.108
I don't know.

01:05:04.144 --> 01:05:05.843
I thought we had a really
great connection,

01:05:05.879 --> 01:05:08.279
but I don't know.

01:05:08.315 --> 01:05:13.251
Maybe it's time to give
somebody else a chance.

01:05:13.286 --> 01:05:15.320
I think we should go.

01:05:35.909 --> 01:05:40.712
You look absolutely beautiful.

01:05:40.747 --> 01:05:42.180
Thank you.

01:05:44.751 --> 01:05:46.117
Excuse me, everyone.

01:05:46.152 --> 01:05:47.296
If I could have your attention,
please.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.398
If you could all just come in
a little closer, please.

01:05:49.422 --> 01:05:52.190
I just want to say a few words.

01:05:54.661 --> 01:05:57.996
30 years.

01:05:58.031 --> 01:06:00.398
It's gone by in a flash.

01:06:00.433 --> 01:06:01.477
But I loved every one
of those years

01:06:01.501 --> 01:06:06.471
because I had my lovely wife,
Nancy, by my side.

01:06:06.506 --> 01:06:08.473
Nancy and I met when I was
in the army

01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:10.875
and she got assigned
to be my pen pal.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.877
We wrote back and forth
for months on end

01:06:12.912 --> 01:06:16.080
and before I knew it I had
fallen in love with someone

01:06:16.116 --> 01:06:17.915
I had never met.

01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.918
And just my luck she was
beautiful, too.

01:06:20.954 --> 01:06:23.688
Tonight I'd like all of you
to know that you are our family

01:06:23.723 --> 01:06:26.524
and you make our estate
feel like a home.

01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:29.394
So I'd like to make a toast.

01:06:29.429 --> 01:06:30.661
To my home.

01:06:30.697 --> 01:06:34.999
To the Wilmore Estates and to
everyone that makes it special.

01:06:47.113 --> 01:06:48.613
Do you want to dance?

01:06:48.648 --> 01:06:50.581
What?

01:06:50.617 --> 01:06:52.250
Your shot.

01:06:53.653 --> 01:06:56.054
- Your chance.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:07:00.794 --> 01:07:01.592
Mr. Wilmore.

01:07:01.628 --> 01:07:03.127
Abbey, I'm so glad you could
make it.

01:07:03.163 --> 01:07:04.262
Would you care to dance?

01:07:04.297 --> 01:07:06.097
I would love to.

01:07:08.268 --> 01:07:09.167
It's a great party.

01:07:09.202 --> 01:07:10.935
You and your wife are such
a lovely couple.

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.170
Thank you.

01:07:12.205 --> 01:07:15.273
I think you and Nick make a
pretty nice couple, yourselves.

01:07:15.308 --> 01:07:17.075
We're not together.

01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:20.611
That's funny,
that's not what I saw.

01:07:20.647 --> 01:07:25.650
About us, I actually wanted
to be honest with you

01:07:25.685 --> 01:07:27.051
about why we're here.

01:07:27.087 --> 01:07:28.419
I know why you're here.

01:07:28.455 --> 01:07:31.956
I may have my secretary refuse
calls from all acquisition people

01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:34.959
but I still take a look
and see who's called.

01:07:34.994 --> 01:07:38.329
So you knew who we are and
you still showed us around?

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:39.730
Well, you did
catch that big fish.

01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:42.478
And the truth is I've always
promised my wife

01:07:42.502 --> 01:07:45.236
I'd sell the place one day
and travel the world

01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:46.838
but I just keep putting it off.

01:07:46.873 --> 01:07:49.340
Maybe the two of you showing up
here on the 30th anniversary

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:50.441
is a sign.

01:07:50.477 --> 01:07:53.344
Now, don't get your hopes up,
but I'll hear you out.

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:55.179
OK...

01:07:55.215 --> 01:07:57.515
Send any paperwork up
to the house tonight

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.450
and I'll look it over, alright?

01:07:59.486 --> 01:08:02.420
Yes.
Yes, I'll send it right away.

01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:03.488
Great.

01:08:03.523 --> 01:08:05.101
I'll see you both tomorrow
morning at 9:00 am sharp

01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:06.491
in my office.

01:08:06.526 --> 01:08:07.992
Yes.

01:08:08.027 --> 01:08:09.093
Perfect.

01:08:09.129 --> 01:08:10.962
Thank you.

01:08:25.912 --> 01:08:27.444
He had us pegged
for the entire time.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:28.246
I know, I can't believe it.

01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:31.515
But he still wants
to meet with us.

01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:32.617
Thank you.

01:08:32.652 --> 01:08:34.563
This is turning out to be
a really good adventure.

01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:39.795
Well, thank you for being
willing to take the risk.

01:08:48.334 --> 01:08:53.957
I... I should get back
to my room.

01:09:07.854 --> 01:09:10.688
We have a really
big day tomorrow.

01:09:54.901 --> 01:09:55.700
Hi.

01:09:55.735 --> 01:09:56.735
<i>Hello.</i>

01:09:56.769 --> 01:09:57.702
Hey, did you by any chance
tell me the meeting

01:09:57.737 --> 01:10:00.338
was an hour earlier
so I wouldn't be late?

01:10:00.373 --> 01:10:01.172
No.

01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:02.006
OK.

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:04.108
I'll see you soon.

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.090
You're the best.

01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:22.293
OK, I break down the numbers,
wow him with the offer.

01:10:22.328 --> 01:10:24.562
I represent the family,
give him the big brand pitch,

01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:27.231
wow him with what he's going to
be handing his legacy off to.

01:10:27.267 --> 01:10:30.234
- We got this.
- Yeah, we do.

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:32.270
Oktoberfest cider,
Christmas cider...

01:10:32.305 --> 01:10:34.705
- Honey Valentine's Day cider.
- I like that.

01:10:34.741 --> 01:10:36.240
St. Patrick's Day cider.

01:10:36.276 --> 01:10:37.308
What's that one you said?

01:10:37.343 --> 01:10:38.142
Easter bunny.

01:10:38.177 --> 01:10:40.311
- The bunny cider!
- The bunny cider. Yeah.

01:10:40.346 --> 01:10:44.782
We can build the Wilmore brand
both locally and nationally.

01:10:44.817 --> 01:10:45.716
In short Mr. Wilmore,

01:10:45.752 --> 01:10:47.952
we see everything
that you've built here.

01:10:47.987 --> 01:10:50.454
And we love all of it.

01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:54.725
Well, my wife and I
have been going over

01:10:54.761 --> 01:10:56.761
this offer all morning.

01:10:56.796 --> 01:10:57.962
It's very impressive.

01:10:57.997 --> 01:11:00.931
I want you to know that we
gave it serious consideration,

01:11:00.967 --> 01:11:04.468
but the answer's gonna be no.

01:11:07.236 --> 01:11:12.176
Mr. Wilmore, I understand
you may have hesitations...

01:11:12.945 --> 01:11:14.312
you said you were willing
to sell

01:11:14.347 --> 01:11:16.781
and this offer is unbeatable.

01:11:16.816 --> 01:11:18.349
- It's an incredible offer.
- Yeah.

01:11:18.384 --> 01:11:19.750
Yes, it is.

01:11:19.786 --> 01:11:21.430
And maybe who I end up
selling to won't be able

01:11:21.454 --> 01:11:24.789
to offer me anything close
to this but

01:11:24.824 --> 01:11:25.934
I've realized that the idea of

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:27.770
letting everything I've built
just get swallowed up

01:11:27.794 --> 01:11:30.294
into a big corporation
makes me uncomfortable.

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:31.330
I'm sorry.

01:11:31.364 --> 01:11:34.398
I like you both very much
but the answer's no.

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:38.536
I knew it was a long shot

01:11:38.571 --> 01:11:40.531
but I really thought we were
going to pull it off.

01:11:45.745 --> 01:11:47.878
I don't regret that we tried.

01:11:47.914 --> 01:11:49.980
Yeah, me neither.

01:11:50.016 --> 01:11:51.949
I guess we go back
to the office now,

01:11:51.984 --> 01:11:53.784
head back to corporate
and leave this place.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.154
You don't belong in corporate.
You belong in a place like this.

01:12:00.827 --> 01:12:02.671
Your dad never said you had
to work in corporate,

01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:06.597
he just wanted you to be a part
of what he built for his family.

01:12:12.372 --> 01:12:13.571
You are a genius.

01:12:15.408 --> 01:12:16.741
Come on!

01:12:17.944 --> 01:12:19.910
Come in.

01:12:19.946 --> 01:12:21.679
Mr. Wilmore, could we bother you

01:12:21.714 --> 01:12:23.881
for one more moment
of your time?

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.015
Alright.

01:12:25.051 --> 01:12:26.517
OK.

01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:36.339
Mr. Wilmore, ever since
I got here this place,

01:12:37.096 --> 01:12:39.430
it felt special to me.

01:12:39.465 --> 01:12:41.699
It felt like... like home.

01:12:42.735 --> 01:12:46.070
What if it was purchased
by Everson Valley Farms

01:12:46.105 --> 01:12:48.406
but run by me, Nick Everson,

01:12:48.441 --> 01:12:53.110
learning every detail
of the place from you?

01:12:53.146 --> 01:12:55.913
Well, that would make selling

01:12:55.948 --> 01:13:00.384
to a big corporation
feel different.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.787
I'm gonna talk to my wife.

01:13:02.822 --> 01:13:05.222
<i>Hey sweetheart, can you come
in here for a moment?</i>

01:13:05.258 --> 01:13:06.757
Thank you!

01:13:06.793 --> 01:13:08.092
I can't believe it?
We did it!

01:13:08.127 --> 01:13:10.561
Talk about cutting it close
to the wire.

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:12.630
I can't wait to tell
your father!

01:13:12.665 --> 01:13:14.799
It's gonna take him
a minute to digest,

01:13:14.834 --> 01:13:16.133
the me running the place part.

01:13:16.169 --> 01:13:17.435
I think he's gonna love it.

01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.480
We've got so many kinks
to iron out.

01:13:18.504 --> 01:13:20.771
We've gotta get attorneys
involved, I'm just...

01:13:20.807 --> 01:13:22.206
I'm so impressed with us.

01:13:22.241 --> 01:13:23.407
Well done. We did it.

01:13:23.443 --> 01:13:26.143
No, you did it.

01:13:26.179 --> 01:13:32.031
This is... this is exactly
what I wanted.

01:13:42.261 --> 01:13:47.557
I... I need to tell
you something.

01:13:48.868 --> 01:13:49.900
OK.

01:14:00.279 --> 01:14:01.846
Why do you have my letter?

01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:05.516
I found it, fishing in Maine.

01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:09.320
I had no idea that this was you.

01:14:09.355 --> 01:14:10.421
You're Reeltraveler?

01:14:10.456 --> 01:14:11.522
That's not possible.

01:14:11.557 --> 01:14:15.359
By the time that I knew
it was you it was too late,

01:14:15.394 --> 01:14:20.331
you had already gone to meet me
at the restaurant.

01:14:20.366 --> 01:14:21.765
Why didn't you show up?

01:14:21.801 --> 01:14:24.368
Because it was too early.

01:14:24.403 --> 01:14:25.302
We still had to work together.

01:14:25.338 --> 01:14:27.104
So you just thought you'd hold
on to this

01:14:27.139 --> 01:14:28.951
and then bring me on this trip...
this whole trip,

01:14:28.975 --> 01:14:31.041
the whole time, you knew
to get me pancakes

01:14:31.077 --> 01:14:32.610
'cause you knew
I loved pancakes...

01:14:32.645 --> 01:14:33.685
You knew how to look at me

01:14:33.713 --> 01:14:35.557
and tell me I was beautiful
the way that I wanted...

01:14:35.581 --> 01:14:37.526
Yes, but you are beautiful.
I meant everything I said.

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:40.217
It... I would... it took me a while
to connect the person

01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:43.987
that I knew from the letter to
the person I knew from work.

01:14:45.159 --> 01:14:46.159
Right.

01:14:46.459 --> 01:14:47.725
Right.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.694
The stubborn know-it-all
who just made you dread

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.196
going into work every day.

01:14:52.231 --> 01:14:53.330
No.

01:14:53.366 --> 01:14:57.201
I'm glad that I could
help you find yourself

01:14:57.236 --> 01:15:00.037
and this is mine.

01:15:00.072 --> 01:15:01.505
I'm going to find my own
way home.

01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:02.541
Abbey.

01:15:13.052 --> 01:15:16.820
I... I still can't believe
Nick was Reeltraveler175.

01:15:16.856 --> 01:15:17.621
Yeah.

01:15:17.657 --> 01:15:19.089
And sitting right across
the hall.

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:19.924
I know.

01:15:19.959 --> 01:15:22.526
And he had my letter
the whole time.

01:15:22.562 --> 01:15:25.029
You know, there were times
when we were emailing

01:15:25.064 --> 01:15:28.365
when I felt like this is it.

01:15:28.401 --> 01:15:30.100
This guy gets me.

01:15:30.136 --> 01:15:33.571
And then there were times
with Nick when I thought

01:15:33.606 --> 01:15:36.874
something's... something's
really happening.

01:15:36.909 --> 01:15:39.577
And now I don't know what
to trust or what to believe

01:15:39.612 --> 01:15:41.845
and I don't feel like
any of it was real.

01:15:41.881 --> 01:15:42.746
Of course it was real.

01:15:42.782 --> 01:15:43.747
Well, I don't know.

01:15:43.783 --> 01:15:47.051
I don't know if I'll ever know
that for sure.

01:15:47.086 --> 01:15:50.854
I just... I really don't get him
not telling me,

01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.057
and I feel like I got played.

01:15:57.263 --> 01:15:58.263
Hey.

01:16:00.132 --> 01:16:01.165
Nick?

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:07.471
I wanted to say
I'm proud of you.

01:16:07.506 --> 01:16:09.873
Not only did you and Abbey
come through for me,

01:16:09.909 --> 01:16:13.277
you brought us a place that lets
Everson Valley Farms

01:16:13.312 --> 01:16:14.278
get back to its roots.

01:16:14.313 --> 01:16:17.982
A place that reminds me
of where it all started.

01:16:18.017 --> 01:16:21.385
That part was all Abbey, dad.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.586
She saw the fit.

01:16:22.622 --> 01:16:25.289
She's been following what
Wilmore's been doing for years.

01:16:25.324 --> 01:16:27.658
You've really found a place
for yourself here, too.

01:16:27.693 --> 01:16:29.838
I think the thing I'm most proud
of is that you've always

01:16:29.862 --> 01:16:34.064
stayed true to yourself,
even when it put us at odds.

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.566
That took guts.

01:16:35.601 --> 01:16:38.569
I'm happy to have you back
in the business, son.

01:16:46.545 --> 01:16:48.545
Thanks, Dad.

01:16:55.955 --> 01:16:58.689
So the secret to the viscosity
of our ciders

01:16:58.724 --> 01:17:00.357
is that we triple strain.

01:17:00.427 --> 01:17:03.694
Each one of these barrels holds
59 gallons,

01:17:03.729 --> 01:17:07.197
and they're handcrafted,
made in Hungary.

01:17:07.233 --> 01:17:12.202
<i>Summer 2014, we try
to do our best to...</i>

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:15.673
Hello?

01:17:15.707 --> 01:17:17.207
<i>Hello.</i>

01:17:17.242 --> 01:17:18.275
Hi.

01:17:19.511 --> 01:17:22.212
<i>Making pancakes.</i>

01:17:22.247 --> 01:17:23.747
<i>Comfort food.</i>

01:17:27.986 --> 01:17:29.619
What's the matter?

01:17:29.655 --> 01:17:31.888
<i>What've you got there?</i>

01:17:31.924 --> 01:17:34.825
It's an invite to Kevin
and Sophie's wedding.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.970
I just don't think I can go.

01:17:35.994 --> 01:17:39.696
He's gonna be there, he's
part of the wedding party.

01:17:43.869 --> 01:17:48.071
I want you to do something
for me.

01:17:48.107 --> 01:17:50.807
Get your letter.

01:17:50.843 --> 01:17:52.008
The message in a bottle?

01:17:52.044 --> 01:17:53.510
Yes.

01:17:53.545 --> 01:17:54.545
It's right here.

01:18:00.085 --> 01:18:01.485
Read me the end of the letter.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.388
Tell me what it says.

01:18:05.424 --> 01:18:07.424
I want something real.

01:18:07.459 --> 01:18:09.926
I have the depth to walk through
real life struggle

01:18:09.962 --> 01:18:12.362
and come out the other side

01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:14.598
and I'm looking for someone
like that, too.

01:18:14.633 --> 01:18:16.733
Flawed, but open.

01:18:16.768 --> 01:18:19.903
Impossible to label
and file away.

01:18:19.938 --> 01:18:22.272
I think we all deserve that,
don't we?

01:18:22.307 --> 01:18:25.442
I'm willing to take the risk.

01:18:25.477 --> 01:18:27.277
Come find me.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.389
That letter is you.

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:40.991
Open.

01:18:41.026 --> 01:18:42.592
Brave.

01:18:42.628 --> 01:18:45.395
Still believing in love.

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.765
Remember that.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.567
And you're going to the wedding.

01:18:50.602 --> 01:18:54.905
I am not allowing my niece
to hide from life.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.493
He's right there.

01:19:17.896 --> 01:19:20.497
OK, let's just go.

01:19:33.712 --> 01:19:35.345
Don't look!

01:19:37.683 --> 01:19:42.152
Do you, Kevin, take Sophie to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

01:19:42.187 --> 01:19:44.321
to have and to hold from
this day forward for as long

01:19:44.356 --> 01:19:46.223
<i>as you both shall live?</i>

01:19:46.258 --> 01:19:47.390
<i>I do.</i>

01:19:47.426 --> 01:19:49.893
<i>And do you, Sophie, take Kevin</i>

01:19:49.928 --> 01:19:51.494
<i>to be your lawfully
wedded husband,</i>

01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:53.396
<i>to have and to hold
from this day forward</i>

01:19:53.432 --> 01:19:55.198
<i>for as long as you
both shall live?</i>

01:19:55.234 --> 01:19:57.734
I do.

01:19:57.769 --> 01:19:59.903
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

01:19:59.938 --> 01:20:01.304
You may kiss the bride.

01:20:19.191 --> 01:20:20.257
You doing OK?

01:20:20.292 --> 01:20:21.825
Yeah.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.928
It's just hard to be back here
where it all started.

01:20:24.963 --> 01:20:27.397
Yeah, well you did it.

01:20:27.432 --> 01:20:29.866
You're here.

01:20:29.901 --> 01:20:33.503
I think it's time that
I exit gracefully, now.

01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:34.538
OK.

01:20:35.274 --> 01:20:36.606
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

01:20:36.642 --> 01:20:38.541
<i>This is for you.</i>

01:20:43.048 --> 01:20:47.384
<i>Look to your right and follow
the candlelit path.</i>

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.696
Go.

01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:01.531
Yes.

01:21:36.201 --> 01:21:38.968
Dear Mary Abigail Lawrence.

01:21:41.206 --> 01:21:43.606
<i>I can't apologize enough.</i>

01:21:43.642 --> 01:21:46.810
<i>You see, the more I've thought
about it</i>

01:21:46.845 --> 01:21:50.980
<i>the more I realized just
how vulnerable you were.</i>

01:21:51.016 --> 01:21:53.917
<i>The whole time you were
the one with your heart open,</i>

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.652
<i>exposed in a letter.</i>

01:21:55.687 --> 01:21:58.154
<i>You were the one left standing,
waiting.</i>

01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:02.926
<i>And throughout everything
my heart was always safe.</i>

01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:06.463
<i>So now it's my turn to make
myself vulnerable.</i>

01:22:06.498 --> 01:22:09.632
<i>To put my heart
out into the world.</i>

01:22:09.668 --> 01:22:11.434
<i>I love the Abbey who shines
at her job</i>

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.536
<i>and expects the same
from everyone else.</i>

01:22:13.572 --> 01:22:14.771
<i>Who's never late.</i>

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:17.474
<i>I love the Abbey who takes
such good care of her aunt,</i>

01:22:17.509 --> 01:22:21.111
<i>and the fact that pancakes
can make you so happy.</i>

01:22:21.146 --> 01:22:24.781
<i>I even love that you are
terrible at making pottery.</i>

01:22:24.816 --> 01:22:27.851
<i>I think you're beautiful,
inside and out.</i>

01:22:27.886 --> 01:22:30.787
<i>I hate that I couldn't see right
away that you and ML Beantown</i>

01:22:30.822 --> 01:22:33.189
<i>could be the same person,</i>

01:22:33.225 --> 01:22:38.328
<i>and I can't begin to tell you
how much I miss that person.</i>

01:22:38.363 --> 01:22:40.189
All I can do...

01:22:42.056 --> 01:22:46.015
...is stand here and tell
you how much I love you

01:22:47.072 --> 01:22:49.839
and ask that you forgive me,

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:55.612
and hopefully that
you love me as well.

01:22:56.848 --> 01:23:02.051
I've never been inspired
to strive for something more

01:23:02.087 --> 01:23:07.456
or be willing to learn and grow.

01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:15.331
I don't want to run anymore.

01:23:15.367 --> 01:23:17.100
I want something real.

01:23:17.135 --> 01:23:20.403
And I even... I adopted a dog.

01:23:20.439 --> 01:23:21.471
What?

01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:25.942
<i>Archie.</i>

01:23:25.977 --> 01:23:27.710
<i>You got Archie.</i>

01:23:27.746 --> 01:23:29.078
I can't...

01:23:29.114 --> 01:23:30.814
I can't believe it.

01:23:32.617 --> 01:23:37.020
Hey.

01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:42.155
You opened your heart when
you sent that message in a bottle.

01:23:47.499 --> 01:23:49.933
And now you've opened mine, too.
