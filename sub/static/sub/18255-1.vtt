01:06.700 --> 01:08.277
<i>I think we can begin.</i>

01:08.827 --> 01:11.274
<i>The first parole request</i>
<i>for Carter "Doc" McCoy.</i>

01:11.378 --> 01:12.819
<i>Is legal counsel present?</i>

01:12.923 --> 01:16.034
Yes, sir. I'm Eugene Stewart,
representing Mr. McCoy.

01:21.965 --> 01:25.464
<i>" Carter McCoy, one to ten year sentence</i>
<i>for armed robbery.</i>

01:26.094 --> 01:28.585
<i>" First offense in the state of Texas.</i>

01:29.305 --> 01:31.836
"Wanted by the state of Ohio
for assault with a deadly weapon...

01:31.940 --> 01:33.087
<i>"...and armed robbery."</i>

01:33.192 --> 01:36.387
The State of Ohio has waived jurisdiction,
Mr. Chairman.

01:36.771 --> 01:39.523
<i>Mr. McCoy is no longer wanted</i>
<i>in that case.</i>

01:43.445 --> 01:44.725
Good luck, man.

01:45.697 --> 01:47.100
<i>Mr. McCoy has served</i>
<i>four years of his sentence.</i>

01:47.205 --> 01:48.942
<i>His record's satisfactory.</i>

01:49.534 --> 01:52.535
<i>Applied for parole</i>
<i>on September fifth of this year.</i>

01:54.831 --> 01:55.858
<i>Remarks?</i>

01:55.962 --> 01:58.485
I would only, once again,
like to point out to the committee...

01:58.589 --> 02:01.154
...Mr. McCoy's good behavior
while a prisoner.

02:01.258 --> 02:03.368
- Notice is taken.
- Thank you, sir.

02:03.472 --> 02:06.037
The board met
in closed chambers last week.

02:06.258 --> 02:10.164
Have you reached a decision regarding
Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

02:10.269 --> 02:12.219
Request for parole is denied.

02:12.431 --> 02:15.800
The prisoner may re-apply
after one calendar year.

03:36.723 --> 03:38.052
Lock 'em up.

04:31.778 --> 04:33.236
<i>Open the gate.</i>

04:46.793 --> 04:50.458
Lance said to have eight hole,
Gallo one, Kirksky two.

04:51.214 --> 04:52.672
Eight hole colored.

04:53.173 --> 04:56.791
Go down to the garden house,
turn to your left, go to the woods.

04:56.968 --> 05:01.215
<i>We're going on to the brush. Burn it.</i>
<i>Take the stumps up out of the ground.</i>

05:01.431 --> 05:04.634
Bob Field, get them dogs out there
close to the trailer.

05:24.121 --> 05:25.200
One hole.

05:34.339 --> 05:35.502
Eight hole.

05:43.974 --> 05:45.016
Thirty.

05:45.517 --> 05:46.560
Thirty.

05:48.019 --> 05:49.062
Come on.

05:49.728 --> 05:51.851
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

05:55.193 --> 05:57.767
Get them dogs in close to 'em, Bob Field.

06:22.554 --> 06:24.048
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

06:28.685 --> 06:32.131
Hogfield, you go to the left
and start rounding up on that brush pile.

06:32.236 --> 06:33.428
Time to go.

06:34.983 --> 06:37.308
<i>Put it back. Catch them, this squad.</i>

06:38.612 --> 06:41.150
<i>Round this pile up and get it burning.</i>

06:44.785 --> 06:46.741
Oh, man, that's just a game.

06:50.081 --> 06:51.990
Man, get on this stump.

06:53.417 --> 06:55.042
Look out, McCoy.

06:55.586 --> 06:58.338
Get your axe and come on up here
and pitch in.

07:00.966 --> 07:03.042
Go to work. Go to work.

07:09.225 --> 07:11.763
<i>De Leon, get the fire going.</i>

07:13.020 --> 07:14.764
That Mexican there...

07:14.897 --> 07:17.981
Get up all this little stuff
and put it on this pile.

07:21.153 --> 07:22.196
Thirty.

07:22.446 --> 07:23.609
Eight hole.

07:23.781 --> 07:26.616
Catch that brush pile here
and get it rounded up.

07:26.742 --> 07:30.989
I want it tight to where it'll burn.
Get these stumps down under the ground.

07:33.874 --> 07:35.072
Bob Field...

07:35.459 --> 07:37.084
<i>...round up that pile.</i>

07:37.211 --> 07:40.082
<i>Get it to burn.</i>
<i>Kirk Shaw, over on the ground...</i>

07:47.220 --> 07:48.880
Keep that line straight.

07:52.517 --> 07:54.059
<i>Keep that line tight.</i>

08:48.531 --> 08:49.776
Hello, Doc.

08:59.709 --> 09:00.824
I'm sorry.

09:05.131 --> 09:06.408
Get to Beynon.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.915
Tell him I'm for sale. His price.

09:12.514 --> 09:13.712
Do it now.

09:26.778 --> 09:28.402
Hello, Mrs. McCoy.

09:29.197 --> 09:31.071
I'd like to see Jack Beynon.

09:35.787 --> 09:36.901
Go ahead.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.321
Class. Is she a regular?

09:43.425 --> 09:45.577
No. Doc McCoy's old lady.

09:45.963 --> 09:47.616
Jeez, is that Carol Ainsley?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.043
Shut up!

09:52.511 --> 09:54.254
How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

09:56.098 --> 09:58.671
Ready to talk about my husband,
Mr. Beynon.

10:01.311 --> 10:02.770
Please sit down.

10:07.484 --> 10:09.691
So the good doctor comes up again.

10:12.823 --> 10:14.899
He asked me to come and see you.

10:16.493 --> 10:17.493
Why?

10:19.538 --> 10:20.701
Can I help?

10:23.417 --> 10:25.041
Yes, I think you can.

10:30.215 --> 10:31.626
How about a drink?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.425
Yeah, I could use one.

10:35.470 --> 10:36.715
Come on over.

10:59.536 --> 11:01.078
You'll be back, Doc.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.661
Mr. Beynon will see you
the day after tomorrow.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.118
12:30 at the River Walk.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.960
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.340
Feel okay?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.717
I'm a lot better off now
than I was an hour ago.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.430
- You want to drive?
- My driver's license has expired.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.559
Sorry I'm late. I was having my hair done,
the girl was slow.

12:58.663 --> 12:59.934
You look fine.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.823
- You feel good?
- Yeah.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.826
- Where do you want to go?
- Take a walk.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.437
What do you want for dinner?

15:48.531 --> 15:50.856
Drinks. Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey...

16:36.202 --> 16:37.317
You okay?

16:38.663 --> 16:39.944
Pretty good.

16:40.915 --> 16:43.318
Made a trip to Oregon
to see my brother and his kids.

16:43.422 --> 16:45.321
I figured it'd be
the last time I'd see them...

16:45.425 --> 16:47.543
...unless they decide to travel.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.167
How's Estelle?

16:49.591 --> 16:50.670
Fatter.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.877
You know, some things never change.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.092
Yeah, that's right.

17:00.518 --> 17:02.096
That's not all of it.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.105
It's been a long time, Doc.

17:07.525 --> 17:09.066
Did you go out much?

17:10.819 --> 17:13.357
Four years, and now
the question comes up.

17:23.874 --> 17:25.782
I couldn't handle it inside.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.454
But I can now.

17:28.754 --> 17:30.296
I'm still here, Doc.

19:09.645 --> 19:11.887
It does something to you, you know.

19:13.274 --> 19:14.982
It does something to you.

19:18.154 --> 19:20.312
It does something to you in there.

19:30.666 --> 19:33.069
We've got time, Doc.
We've got lots of time.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.078
Just give me a minute, baby.

19:36.172 --> 19:38.580
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.

19:40.885 --> 19:42.048
Really?

19:42.261 --> 19:43.506
Really.

19:47.058 --> 19:49.216
Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

20:00.862 --> 20:02.689
It's been so long.

20:04.908 --> 20:06.236
So long.

20:28.182 --> 20:29.380
Fantastic.

20:34.981 --> 20:36.226
She's here.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.352
Hey, I was gonna fix you breakfast.

20:42.456 --> 20:43.811
You were sleeping.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.317
A little ketchup.

20:50.329 --> 20:52.239
And then we have a little...

21:00.756 --> 21:01.835
Thank you.

21:04.176 --> 21:06.168
- For what?
- For getting me out.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.139
It was a pleasure.

21:20.567 --> 21:21.942
Thank you, ma'am.

21:26.448 --> 21:29.021
Hey, Claude. Here's your boy.

21:39.628 --> 21:41.115
You have to be kidding.

21:41.219 --> 21:44.463
Not at all.
Just a pleasant way to have lunch.

21:45.050 --> 21:46.164
Sit down.

21:49.012 --> 21:51.414
It's good to see you
in them civilian clothes.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.637
It just takes a long arm, Beynon.

21:55.643 --> 21:58.644
You know, it's hard to say
how those things happen.

21:59.939 --> 22:02.975
The parole board almost never
changes their decision.

22:04.026 --> 22:06.517
It must be because I'm a model prisoner.

22:08.739 --> 22:11.491
This is the only time
you and I meet in public.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.320
Any business with me...

22:14.912 --> 22:16.649
...you handle it with him.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.289
He's my brother.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.659
Back with your own people, now.

22:21.836 --> 22:23.793
I got you some professionals.

22:24.338 --> 22:26.247
I'll get my own men, Beynon.

22:29.009 --> 22:31.679
You run the job, but I run the show.

22:32.138 --> 22:33.632
And don't forget it.

22:39.353 --> 22:41.513
You've got two weeks to set it up.

22:42.566 --> 22:46.694
It's not a big bank, but it handles
the cash deposits for an oil company.

22:47.696 --> 22:49.604
Over half a million dollars.

22:50.781 --> 22:52.275
It's a family bank.

22:52.908 --> 22:54.273
The brother of the bank director...

22:54.378 --> 22:57.867
...is on the board of directors
at Con-Sol Oil in Beacon City.

23:05.588 --> 23:08.375
Here's a couple of fellas
I'd like you to meet.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.377
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson.

23:17.725 --> 23:19.423
Yeah, I've heard of you.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.096
You work with Miller?

23:21.771 --> 23:23.479
You're out of touch, Doc.

23:23.939 --> 23:25.517
Miller got blown up.

23:28.903 --> 23:29.945
Where?

23:30.738 --> 23:32.113
Fort Lauderdale.

23:33.157 --> 23:34.865
- Were you with him?
- Yeah.

23:36.952 --> 23:38.067
I got out.

23:39.663 --> 23:40.663
You?

23:41.540 --> 23:43.699
I was backup man on a payroll job.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.030
I'd hit some liquor stores. I drive good.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.243
I drive.

23:49.839 --> 23:50.839
Sure.

23:52.926 --> 23:55.298
I want Mexican visas and passports.

23:55.845 --> 23:57.423
They'll be ready.

23:58.264 --> 24:00.008
You boys just do your job.

24:08.108 --> 24:09.187
Carol.

24:10.568 --> 24:12.027
Bank guard, 7:59.

24:12.404 --> 24:13.602
He's early.

24:21.996 --> 24:24.570
You got a flashlight, some light batteries.

24:25.291 --> 24:27.961
A-hooks, pliers, wire cutters...

24:33.049 --> 24:35.291
What do you want all this stuff for?

24:35.635 --> 24:38.173
- I'm going on a picnic.
- Going on a picnic?

24:39.013 --> 24:40.424
Well... okay.

24:47.146 --> 24:50.978
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>especially you gentlemen...</i>

24:51.316 --> 24:55.610
<i>We very proudly present</i>
<i>the pride and Joy of Beacon City.</i>

24:55.904 --> 24:58.934
<i>Our own high-stepping and high-kicking...</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:01.191
<i>...Southwest Texas Ropers.</i>

25:24.476 --> 25:28.254
<i>Following the strutters...</i>
<i>representing the Ladies' Auxiliary</i> of...

25:28.359 --> 25:32.648
<i>...the Volunteer Fire Brigade.</i>
<i>We have the first beautiful float...</i>

25:32.942 --> 25:37.272
<i>...which consists of the Constitution</i>
<i>in the history of the Lone Star State.</i>

25:53.670 --> 25:54.780
Good morning.

25:54.884 --> 25:57.078
I'd like an application
for a checking account, please.

25:57.182 --> 26:00.998
He goes here, follows down here.
Now, this is the spot you're looking for.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.340
Here. Yeah.

26:02.471 --> 26:04.677
- Can I get a copy of this?
- Yes, sir.

26:14.274 --> 26:16.232
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.089
Change for a $50, please.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.380
$20, $30...

26:48.141 --> 26:50.845
...$40, $45, $50.

26:52.103 --> 26:54.724
Thank you.
Y'all come back and see us soon.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.819
Set your clocks for five minutes after 9:00.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.480
All right, on the nose, now.

27:04.907 --> 27:07.521
The diversionary explosions are spaced
20 seconds apart.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.029
That gives you...

27:09.662 --> 27:12.414
...one minute and 38 seconds,
before they blow.

27:15.626 --> 27:18.663
You've got a bank president,
you have three tellers.

27:20.131 --> 27:21.663
And you've got a bank guard.

27:21.767 --> 27:23.079
Usually on the right as you come in.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.670
Pin him right away.

27:24.802 --> 27:27.590
Careful he doesn't panic,
and go shoot somebody.

27:29.057 --> 27:32.057
You got one local police car.
Now he's a rover.

27:32.602 --> 27:35.715
Shouldn't be anywhere near the vicinity
when we make our hit.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.883
Traffic is usually light at that hour.

27:37.987 --> 27:41.223
There are three exits. One at Hopkins,
one at Guadalupe Street...

27:41.327 --> 27:42.972
...and then there's the alley.

27:43.077 --> 27:45.608
Will you put that away and pay attention!

27:49.285 --> 27:51.194
Now the guard carries a.38.

27:53.289 --> 27:56.290
The cops carry 357-magnums.

27:59.962 --> 28:01.587
You know what this is.

28:02.965 --> 28:05.587
This'll stop an M-2 army rifle at 50 yards.

28:08.763 --> 28:11.254
I've been working ten years without one.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.635
- Suit yourself.
- Thank you.

28:16.354 --> 28:17.591
What about the vault?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.926
It's a Chambers Reilly.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.098
It's on a time lock.
Opens up 20 minutes before office hours.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.203
Wire pull over?

28:23.308 --> 28:26.065
No, one-inch stuff
on a three number combination.

28:26.197 --> 28:27.359
That's me.

28:27.697 --> 28:31.280
No, no. I'll handle the fine stuff.
You're backup all the way.

28:32.702 --> 28:34.529
Whatever you need, brother.

28:35.330 --> 28:36.445
Right.

28:39.376 --> 28:42.626
You keep going over this.
I don't want anybody lost.

28:43.338 --> 28:46.036
If we're clean,
Gollie will take us across at Laredo.

28:46.140 --> 28:49.252
If we're hot, we'll have to try Laughlin's
in El Paso.

28:53.724 --> 28:55.882
Aren't we going a little bit hard?

29:01.648 --> 29:03.439
That's a walk-in bank, man.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.396
A piece of cake.

29:07.571 --> 29:10.240
You don't have to be Dillinger for that one.

29:16.830 --> 29:17.830
Bang.

29:28.758 --> 29:30.335
Dillinger got killed.

29:33.554 --> 29:34.929
Not in the bank.

29:38.893 --> 29:40.351
Take it with you.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.447
Expenses.

30:08.632 --> 30:12.083
Tell Beynon I don't want any mix-ups.
I make one phone call.

30:13.220 --> 30:15.841
And his people better be there.
All of them.

30:18.266 --> 30:19.304
I understand.

30:19.408 --> 30:20.629
Beynon's to be alone at the drop.

30:20.733 --> 30:23.718
Only one car in the garage
at the ranch and that's it.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.299
Now, I'm not gonna have the money.

30:25.404 --> 30:29.312
And she's not gonna know where it is
until I know I'm clear. Got it?

30:30.194 --> 30:32.015
- He understands.
- Good, good.

30:32.119 --> 30:34.401
Make sure everybody does. Okay?

31:28.376 --> 31:30.369
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:33.006 --> 31:34.915
Good morning.

31:35.884 --> 31:37.082
Good morning.

31:45.602 --> 31:46.800
Good morning.

31:50.065 --> 31:52.467
Good morning, Mr. Morgan. How are you?

31:52.571 --> 31:53.895
Fine, thank you.

33:03.722 --> 33:04.764
Hold it.

33:27.327 --> 33:28.703
Come on, move it!

34:05.282 --> 34:06.361
Relax.

34:23.299 --> 34:25.706
Superior technology, my ass.

34:37.938 --> 34:39.315
Hands up!

34:46.657 --> 34:48.364
Mr. President? Up!

34:54.373 --> 34:56.199
Everybody, out this way.

35:01.338 --> 35:04.587
Come on, come on! Hurry it up! Move it!

35:07.468 --> 35:08.468
Go!

35:14.267 --> 35:16.094
Come on, move it!

35:20.481 --> 35:22.225
Come on, honey, get on it.

35:40.001 --> 35:42.040
Now just relax.

35:42.628 --> 35:43.957
Face down!

36:01.188 --> 36:03.311
Move it. Move it, honey.

36:05.692 --> 36:07.981
They're on their way. Just relax.

36:09.905 --> 36:11.315
Everybody relax.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.244
Ninety seconds.

37:30.235 --> 37:31.278
Seventy-five.

37:36.491 --> 37:37.654
Sixty-five.

37:41.037 --> 37:42.318
Fifty, brother.

37:54.675 --> 37:55.675
No!

37:55.926 --> 37:56.926
No!

38:05.436 --> 38:06.716
Stupid bastard!

38:26.499 --> 38:27.779
Take the wheel.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.531
Take the wheel.

38:58.738 --> 38:59.931
How did it go?

39:00.035 --> 39:02.273
Bad. Jackson killed the guard.

39:09.457 --> 39:12.079
Fourteen seconds till the next one goes off.

39:14.254 --> 39:16.246
Come on, come on.

40:11.311 --> 40:12.311
Shit.

41:48.614 --> 41:49.944
Where's Jackson?

41:51.452 --> 41:52.910
He didn't make it.

41:53.412 --> 41:54.823
Neither did you.

43:44.521 --> 43:47.180
<i>...was held up this morning</i>
<i>shortly after opening.</i>

43:47.284 --> 43:51.686
<i>The bank officials state that $750,000</i>
<i>was taken by three masked men...</i>

43:52.028 --> 43:53.066
<i>...who forced the employees...</i>

43:53.170 --> 43:55.186
Hey, there's only $500,000 here.

43:55.290 --> 43:57.239
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

44:00.495 --> 44:01.495
Doc?

44:02.122 --> 44:04.079
I see it. Take it easy.

44:04.291 --> 44:06.746
They're looking for three men, remember?

44:21.601 --> 44:23.973
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

44:28.940 --> 44:30.221
Okay, drive on.

45:02.766 --> 45:04.011
I'll kill him.

45:05.602 --> 45:07.180
I'll kill that mother!

45:15.028 --> 45:16.107
He's on.

45:17.739 --> 45:18.854
I'm here.

45:20.575 --> 45:21.575
Yeah?

45:23.120 --> 45:25.519
<i>Yeah?</i>

45:25.788 --> 45:26.867
I'm here.

45:42.221 --> 45:43.680
They checked in.

45:56.986 --> 45:58.768
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

45:58.872 --> 46:00.523
I've never been there.

46:01.574 --> 46:03.697
When we met, it was at his office.

46:09.415 --> 46:10.874
Do you trust him?

46:11.917 --> 46:14.154
I don't figure he's gonna try to cross us.

46:14.258 --> 46:16.578
At least not until he gets his money.

46:16.839 --> 46:19.959
Well, let's just send his cut back
and just get going.

46:22.594 --> 46:25.085
If we make a mistake, he's gonna burn us.

46:25.472 --> 46:28.169
You make a deal,
you're better off keeping up your end.

46:28.273 --> 46:30.057
I don't want to go there.

46:32.103 --> 46:33.597
Let's do it my way.

47:12.478 --> 47:13.557
Stay here.

47:15.523 --> 47:17.681
I'll wrap it up as quick as I can.

48:01.526 --> 48:03.435
News said two people killed.

48:03.611 --> 48:06.019
Three. Rudy got ambitious.

48:06.489 --> 48:07.900
And you got him.

48:09.075 --> 48:10.268
That's right.

48:10.372 --> 48:12.028
What about your wife?

48:12.871 --> 48:14.108
Let's cut up the money, Beynon.

48:14.213 --> 48:15.782
I want to get north.

48:17.166 --> 48:19.407
She told me no one would get killed.

48:29.511 --> 48:31.171
I'm in a hurry, Beynon.

48:31.388 --> 48:33.879
You still don't get the picture, do you?

48:34.725 --> 48:37.892
And I've always heard
what a smart-ass operator you was.

48:38.228 --> 48:39.473
No applause.

48:42.399 --> 48:44.308
Let's examine the situation.

48:45.986 --> 48:48.857
One. An extremely attractive woman.

48:56.038 --> 48:58.069
And there's the woman's husband.

48:58.173 --> 49:00.739
And there's a man with political influence.

49:01.419 --> 49:04.373
A man who can easily get a parole
for a convict.

49:05.548 --> 49:06.924
Why should he?

49:07.300 --> 49:08.870
A simple reason, McCoy.

49:08.975 --> 49:10.593
Let's get down to it.

49:10.804 --> 49:13.091
Radio's rapping about $750,000.

49:13.847 --> 49:15.887
There's a half a million, here.

49:17.935 --> 49:20.093
A little more was taken out before.

49:20.854 --> 49:23.689
You see, my brother's
the director of that bank.

49:23.941 --> 49:26.479
We had a few problems we had to iron out.

49:29.530 --> 49:31.487
Okay. We covered you...

49:33.158 --> 49:34.158
Yeah.

49:34.451 --> 49:36.029
You surely did, Doc.

49:43.335 --> 49:46.122
My old lady must've made you
a lot of promises.

49:47.172 --> 49:48.215
Close.

49:48.757 --> 49:50.168
I wouldn't feel...

52:04.349 --> 52:05.392
Stupid!

52:06.518 --> 52:08.427
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

52:08.603 --> 52:10.219
Why didn't you tell me?

52:10.323 --> 52:12.602
There wasn't any way to explain it.

52:18.822 --> 52:20.779
You sent me to him, you know.

52:30.333 --> 52:32.456
What the hell do you want anyway?

52:53.982 --> 52:55.227
Goddamn you!

53:17.880 --> 53:19.208
Still no answer.

53:19.715 --> 53:21.126
Something's wrong.

53:22.885 --> 53:25.341
Come on! Come on!

53:30.851 --> 53:32.310
What's the damage?

53:34.688 --> 53:37.091
Your collarbone's broken
but it's not shattered.

53:37.195 --> 53:38.982
There's no infection, yet.

53:39.318 --> 53:42.023
Those bandages ought
to be changed twice a day.

53:43.030 --> 53:44.228
It's okay.

53:44.865 --> 53:46.657
I got a nurse in mind.

53:49.830 --> 53:52.451
The three of us are gonna
do some traveling.

53:54.917 --> 53:57.206
We're gonna take your car to El Paso.

53:58.337 --> 54:00.377
We... we can't leave here.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.671
That's not possible.
I mean, we have all of this.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.680
Is that possible, Mrs. Clinton?

54:13.936 --> 54:15.810
Just tell us what you want.

54:22.653 --> 54:24.435
What kind of a car do you drive?

54:24.539 --> 54:26.273
A Ford. We have a Ford.

54:31.495 --> 54:32.740
That's good.

54:35.082 --> 54:36.826
That's very good, Harold.

54:37.626 --> 54:39.868
You run on out and gas up the Ford.

54:41.172 --> 54:44.173
If anybody but you comes back, Harold...

54:45.676 --> 54:47.716
...she gets her clock stopped.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.680
You do what he says, Harold.

54:55.685 --> 54:57.096
Just do as I say.

55:14.996 --> 55:17.238
You. Get a cloth.

55:18.291 --> 55:19.869
You're gonna wash me.

55:26.424 --> 55:28.455
They still may be on the way to Laredo.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.386
What about El Paso?
He's a friend of Laughlin.

55:32.013 --> 55:33.289
Well, we have to cover them both.

55:33.394 --> 55:35.459
We've got to get somebody down there.
Either Rudy or...

55:35.564 --> 55:37.931
...McCoy's got a half a million bucks.

55:38.186 --> 55:40.392
- Put out the word.
- What about Jack?

55:42.232 --> 55:44.718
Just dump him down a dry well,
if you can find one.

55:44.822 --> 55:46.941
No, he ought to be buried proper.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.229
You just do what I tell you.

55:53.158 --> 55:54.569
Thank you, ma'am.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.164
Wendy, sit down.

56:02.042 --> 56:04.165
Two day-coach tickets to El Paso.

56:09.675 --> 56:13.009
Leaves in 45 minutes. Gate three.
Thank you, ma'am.

57:14.865 --> 57:16.573
Kind of tricky, isn't it?

57:22.748 --> 57:24.539
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:39.223 --> 57:40.551
Come over here.

57:57.240 --> 57:59.778
You don't always have to
take your gun out.

58:02.578 --> 58:04.405
I'll do anything you want.

58:05.748 --> 58:06.791
Really.

58:07.458 --> 58:08.501
I will.

58:14.048 --> 58:15.957
Get rid of that nail polish.

58:17.552 --> 58:18.552
Okay.

58:18.761 --> 58:20.172
I don't like it.

58:32.942 --> 58:34.650
And get rid of that, too.

58:35.487 --> 58:36.685
What is that?

59:00.428 --> 59:02.966
Don't get any blood on me. I hate blood.

59:12.398 --> 59:15.352
Say, you wouldn't happen to be
a Mormon, would you?

59:16.903 --> 59:18.390
No, I'm afraid not.

59:18.494 --> 59:19.597
I'd like another one.

59:19.701 --> 59:20.978
Me, neither.

59:21.532 --> 59:24.202
I'm from Orem. That's right near Salt Lake.

59:25.036 --> 59:29.365
There's about 12 people in the state who
aren't Mormons, and I'm one of them.

59:32.043 --> 59:34.449
I guess that makes you kind of special.

59:35.295 --> 59:37.868
- Yeah, I guess it does.
- Thank you.

59:38.715 --> 59:39.913
Hey, baby.

59:42.511 --> 59:45.041
You wouldn't be taking the train
to Salt Lake, would you?

59:45.146 --> 59:46.680
No, I'm afraid not!

59:47.015 --> 59:48.380
That's just my luck.

59:48.484 --> 59:50.296
Listen, I hope you have a really nice trip.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.635
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

59:56.233 --> 59:57.470
Where's the bag?

59:57.575 --> 59:59.441
It's in the locker. I've got the key.

01:00:38.274 --> 01:00:39.301
A man helped me open it.

01:00:39.405 --> 01:00:40.687
How long ago?

01:00:41.444 --> 01:00:42.986
Fifteen minutes ago.

01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:51.782
It's the oldest con game in the world.
He switched keys with you.

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:59.740
He'll figure you for more time.
He's probably still in the station.

01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:00.953
Find him.

01:01:28.115 --> 01:01:32.493
<i>Your attention please. The Lone Star Flyer</i>
<i>for ...and El Paso now boarding.</i>

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:40.202

<i>...El Paso now boarding on track site.</i>

01:01:57.603 --> 01:01:59.726
- There you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

01:02:16.706 --> 01:02:19.872
You have coach number six.
You've got coach number four.

01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:21.834
You have coach number two.

01:02:22.086 --> 01:02:24.033
- My aunt forgot her bag.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:24.137 --> 01:02:25.504
Coach number six.

01:02:26.047 --> 01:02:29.048
Coach number four. Coach number three.

01:02:32.303 --> 01:02:34.711
- I'm gonna see somebody off.
- All right.

<i>Last call for the Lone Star Flyer</i>
<i>now leaving at track site.</i>

01:03:15.472 --> 01:03:19.600
That's awfully heavy. To save my life,
I can't possibly lift it up there.

01:03:20.976 --> 01:03:22.091
Thank you.

01:03:22.478 --> 01:03:24.270
That's coach number one.

01:03:24.439 --> 01:03:25.898
That's coach three.

01:03:42.749 --> 01:03:44.902
Y'all gonna miss the train, you know?

01:03:45.006 --> 01:03:47.199
Car number three, right over there.

01:03:47.303 --> 01:03:48.789
All aboard!

01:05:03.537 --> 01:05:06.242
Itâ€™ll be open five minutes out of the station.

01:06:45.304 --> 01:06:46.964
Tickets, please.

01:07:37.147 --> 01:07:38.522
Tickets, please.

01:07:38.774 --> 01:07:41.728
When you work on a lock,
don't leave any scratches.

01:08:05.216 --> 01:08:06.674
Tickets please.

01:08:07.051 --> 01:08:08.711
Two. End of the line.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:13.800
I'll get you.

01:08:28.573 --> 01:08:29.984
Stick 'em up!

01:08:32.618 --> 01:08:35.157
I said, "Stick 'em up or I'll shoot you."

01:08:44.005 --> 01:08:45.160
Now, listen...

01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:48.747
...I know you're a good kid.
Now, get back there with your mother.

01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:51.962
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna break your little arm.

01:08:53.055 --> 01:08:54.055
Okay?

01:09:00.813 --> 01:09:02.428
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:09:02.532 --> 01:09:05.689

Next stop: Alpine, Texas.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:14.236
Next stop: Alpine, Texas.

01:09:34.471 --> 01:09:36.381
Talk it up a little, Harold.

01:09:37.558 --> 01:09:39.265
It'd be good for you.

01:09:40.853 --> 01:09:42.180
Loosen you up.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.473
Something ought to loosen him up.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.477
Something ought to loosen him up.

01:09:51.072 --> 01:09:53.444
What are we going to El Paso for, Rudy?

01:09:55.451 --> 01:09:57.241
I'm looking for a suitcase.

01:09:57.369 --> 01:09:59.028
At the Laughlin Hotel.

01:10:04.209 --> 01:10:05.402
You Laughlin?

01:10:05.506 --> 01:10:07.293
Yes, sir, all the time.

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:10.495
This is my wife and that there's Junior.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.004
Congratulations.

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:16.541
- I need a room.
- You don't have to look any farther.

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:19.010
One thing we got here is lots of rooms.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:20.641
Sign right there.

01:10:21.434 --> 01:10:23.261
That'll be $5 in advance.

01:10:23.937 --> 01:10:25.016
Junior...

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.062
...show this gentleman to his room.

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.019
Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.314
No girls allowed in the rooms.

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:35.688
House rules.

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:03.600
Call the conductor.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.388
Mama, Mama, Mama...

01:11:06.604 --> 01:11:08.136
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.481
<i>Shuttle train from Alpine</i>
<i>now arriving at track site.</i>

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:15.068
<i>Shuttle train from Alpine</i>
<i>now arriving at track site.</i>

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.345
You're all right.

01:11:46.853 --> 01:11:48.513
How did you get it back?

01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:51.300
If you're trying to get me back
in Huntsville...

01:11:51.404 --> 01:11:53.884
...you're going about it in the right way.

01:11:53.988 --> 01:11:57.141
I wouldn't worry about it,
'cause I can always get you out.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:12:00.517
I mean, I can screw every prison official
in Texas, if I want to.

01:12:00.621 --> 01:12:02.186
Texas is a big state.

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:04.609
- I can handle it.
- Yeah, I bet you can.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.582
You'd do the same for me, Doc,
wouldn't you?

01:12:14.922 --> 01:12:17.294
I mean, if I got caught, wouldn't you?

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:33.719
You don't like the way things are,
I don't like the way things are.

01:12:33.823 --> 01:12:35.137
What are we gonna do about it?

01:12:35.241 --> 01:12:36.977
Maybe we should split up.

01:12:38.404 --> 01:12:40.396
I'll cut up the money with you.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.031
- Do you mean that?
- Yeah, I mean it.

01:12:50.415 --> 01:12:52.075
Well, I don't want to.

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:14.016
I have to stop.

01:13:14.481 --> 01:13:15.560
Not now.

01:13:15.733 --> 01:13:18.270
We have to beat that suitcase to El Paso.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:38.370
We'll grab a hotel room, tonight.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:40.422
First thing tomorrow...

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:43.588
...just go out and buy us another car.

01:13:43.801 --> 01:13:46.287
Then you go out,
buy yourself some other clothes.

01:13:46.391 --> 01:13:48.095
And pick up some for me.

01:13:48.681 --> 01:13:50.840
Tonight, I want you to go out...

01:13:51.684 --> 01:13:53.549
You go out and get some food.
Paper bag it.

01:13:53.653 --> 01:13:55.426
We'll eat it in the hotel room.

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.810
What happens when they find the body?

01:13:58.733 --> 01:14:00.764
All they've got is a description.

01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:03.935
Cops need a connection to channel it,
and they haven't got it.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.645
It ain't gonna do them any good.

01:14:05.749 --> 01:14:07.726
You've got it all figured out, don't you?

01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:08.831
No.

01:14:10.745 --> 01:14:12.527
There's a few of things I'm working on.

01:14:12.631 --> 01:14:13.784
Like what?

01:14:13.915 --> 01:14:15.409
Where'd you get it?

01:14:19.295 --> 01:14:20.706
It was a gift.

01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:26.594
- Chico, get Lt. Judson down here.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:33.878
Call a medical officer, too.

01:14:33.983 --> 01:14:36.008
Come on, boys,
let's look at some photographs.

01:14:36.112 --> 01:14:37.183
Yes, sir.

01:14:42.025 --> 01:14:44.267
If Rudy was by himself, we're okay.

01:14:44.695 --> 01:14:46.486
If he worked for Beynon...

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:52.773
...Beynon's people will be waiting for us
at Laughlin's in El Paso.

01:14:52.878 --> 01:14:54.412
You're full of "ifs."

01:14:55.789 --> 01:14:57.200
So are you, baby.

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:05.623
I think you liked it with him.

01:15:07.801 --> 01:15:09.379
I think he got to you.

01:15:11.513 --> 01:15:12.556
Maybe.

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.468
At least I got to him.

01:15:17.269 --> 01:15:18.506
What about this one, boys?

01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:20.801
- Yeah. Yeah, that's him!
- Yeah, that's the guy!

01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:22.719
- That's the one!
- That's him, all right.

01:15:22.823 --> 01:15:24.477
That's the man, Officer.

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:27.311
That's the one you shot, Raymond.

01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:30.652
What about him?

01:15:33.953 --> 01:15:37.701
Listen, I'm a friend of the court, right?
That's why I'm here.

01:15:38.707 --> 01:15:40.860
You're here because you're under arrest.

01:15:40.964 --> 01:15:42.122
Lock him up.

01:15:43.295 --> 01:15:46.741
<i>The man has been positively identified</i>
<i>as Carter "Doc" McCoy...</i>

01:15:46.845 --> 01:15:49.537
<i>...only recently paroled</i>
<i>from Huntsville Penitentiary.</i>

01:15:49.642 --> 01:15:53.291
<i>He is believed to be traveling</i>
<i>with his wife, Carol Ainsley McCoy.</i>

01:15:53.395 --> 01:15:55.511
<i>Stay tuned for further details.</i>

01:15:56.308 --> 01:15:58.217
How you doing there, Harold?

01:16:06.026 --> 01:16:08.149
Do I have to take it off again?

01:16:08.487 --> 01:16:09.862
The radio, off.

01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:38.176
Come on, work!

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:43.972
Give me the news!

01:16:48.693 --> 01:16:50.650
Can't trust a thing nowadays.

01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:55.734
Tell you something. One of these days,
you're gonna have to trust somebody.

01:16:56.784 --> 01:16:57.899
I trust.

01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:07.542
You want to see what I trust?

01:17:09.714 --> 01:17:11.089
"In God I trust."

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:14.128
It's the words on the back of every bill.

01:17:15.678 --> 01:17:19.261
Just keep that up, Doc,
and it won't matter how far we get away.

01:17:20.224 --> 01:17:22.793
'Cause there won't be
anything left between us.

01:17:22.898 --> 01:17:24.436
You understand that?

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.100
Nothing.

01:17:42.495 --> 01:17:43.658
Pull over.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:05.889
Yes, sir.

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:08.888
Yeah. I'd like to have a radio.

01:18:09.065 --> 01:18:10.135
One of those portables.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.020
All right, sir. We got them
from $15 to $55.

01:18:13.152 --> 01:18:14.223
Take your pick.

01:18:14.327 --> 01:18:16.312
- A $15 job.
- All right, sir.

01:18:16.489 --> 01:18:18.687
<i>...Beacon City bank robbery last week...</i>

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:23.409
<i>...where they, along with two accomplices,</i>
<i>made off with more than three quarters...</i>

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:31.580
That'll be, $15.95 and 60 cents tax, sir.

01:18:32.337 --> 01:18:33.914
I'll get your change.

01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:41.838
Want your change, sir?

01:18:49.687 --> 01:18:52.225
Now we got trouble. Let's clear the car.

01:19:00.865 --> 01:19:02.142
Yes, sir, can I help you?

01:19:02.246 --> 01:19:04.614
I want a shotgun, 12-gauge pump.

01:19:05.745 --> 01:19:08.525
- How about this one right here?
- Yeah, that's fine. Wrap it up.

01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:10.987
Sir, you'll have to sign this form here.

01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:14.085
And let me have a pack
of those double-ought bucks.

01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:17.250
What are you going to do,
knock a wall down?

01:19:22.219 --> 01:19:25.754
Sir, you'll have to...
have to fill out these forms here, sir.

01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:33.507
You know what this is, don't you, mister?

01:19:33.612 --> 01:19:34.612
Yeah.

01:19:35.024 --> 01:19:37.431
All right, now wrap that up. Let's go.

01:19:41.238 --> 01:19:43.314
I don't know where they went to.

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:56.081
Operator, get me the police.

01:19:57.671 --> 01:20:00.672
There's this car here,
and the man's in there, too.

01:20:01.258 --> 01:20:02.534
You might...

01:20:02.639 --> 01:20:05.304
...try down here or up there. I don't know.

01:20:07.097 --> 01:20:09.506
Call Willie up. That lady right there.

01:20:23.781 --> 01:20:25.102
Hold it! Right there!

01:20:25.206 --> 01:20:27.357
Get those guns out on the street.

01:20:27.951 --> 01:20:29.327
Kick them over.

01:20:30.954 --> 01:20:32.912
Now, lay down in that gutter!

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.244
In the gutter!

01:20:39.088 --> 01:20:40.796
You, keep your face down!

01:21:14.498 --> 01:21:16.703
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:21:58.666 --> 01:21:59.864
Hang a "U."

01:22:06.716 --> 01:22:08.044
Punch it, baby.

01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:15.969
Go ahead.

01:22:31.907 --> 01:22:33.236
In there.

01:23:08.277 --> 01:23:10.981
- How much to Dallas?
- Sixteen dollars.

01:23:56.616 --> 01:23:57.815
Hey, dummy!

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:03.490
How you doing, Slim?

01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:05.202
Where you going?

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:06.405
Mexico.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:08.699
How much did you pay for that thing?

01:24:08.804 --> 01:24:09.846
$2,800.

01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:13.214
Come on, let's go.

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:36.148
Here, Harold.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:37.989
Here.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.360
Kitty.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.531
Have a rib bone.

01:24:52.046 --> 01:24:53.540
Have another rib.

01:24:57.302 --> 01:24:58.631
Christ, Rudy...

01:24:59.096 --> 01:25:00.582
...you ruined my skirt.

01:25:00.687 --> 01:25:03.597
Goddamn it, what'd you do that for?
Jesus!

01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:08.603
Know why I did that?

01:25:12.066 --> 01:25:13.690
It makes me feel good.

01:25:17.488 --> 01:25:18.531
Stop it.

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:21.153
Rudy! Goddamn it!

01:25:25.413 --> 01:25:26.567
Have one yourself.

01:25:26.671 --> 01:25:27.862
You have one.

01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:32.742
- Have a bone, Harold.
- Have a French fry.

01:25:33.254 --> 01:25:34.914
Have a rib, Harold.

01:25:37.508 --> 01:25:38.753
Poor Harold.

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.101
Those are good ribs.

01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:56.512
- Wait a minute.
- Have some French fries.

01:25:56.617 --> 01:25:57.939
Wait a minute!

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:02.278
I don't like this game, anymore.

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:03.949
Okay.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.487
You hear me?

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.627
You! You!

01:26:07.912 --> 01:26:08.912
Okay.

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:32.470
<i>Authorities are reportedly on the lookout</i>
<i>for Doc McCoy and his wife, Carol.</i>

01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:36.810
<i>The couple is reported traveling</i>
<i>in a late-model, gray Mercury sedan.</i>

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:40.224
<i>The pair is wanted for the recent</i>
<i>bank robbery in Beacon City, Texas...</i>

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:43.072
<i>...which netted the thieves $750,000.</i>

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.601
<i>In the course of the robbery,</i>
<i>two men were killed.</i>

01:26:45.705 --> 01:26:47.823
<i>The holdup money is still missing.</i>

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.407
Good evening.

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:54.494
Two hamburgers.

01:26:55.542 --> 01:26:57.241
A milkshake and two coffees.

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.542
- What kind of milkshake?
- Chocolate.

01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:01.909
- How about some fries?
- Why not?

01:27:02.013 --> 01:27:03.013
Okay.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.290
Roll it up part way, please.

01:28:27.426 --> 01:28:28.426
Bang.

01:28:35.434 --> 01:28:36.434
Shit!

01:28:46.528 --> 01:28:47.772
She made us.

01:28:58.623 --> 01:29:00.662
There's that goddamn gray Merc.

01:30:02.186 --> 01:30:03.341
Punch it!

01:30:03.445 --> 01:30:04.683
Punch it, baby!

01:33:22.885 --> 01:33:25.210
Help me shove these back.

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.541
It's been ten minutes.
Come on out of there.

01:36:34.365 --> 01:36:35.480
You okay?

01:36:37.326 --> 01:36:39.153
I guess so. I don't know.

01:36:41.748 --> 01:36:43.657
Well, it looks kind of deep.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.003
No scar.

01:36:55.387 --> 01:36:58.424
Don't scratch.
It's liable to give you an infection.

01:37:01.143 --> 01:37:02.508
What did I tell you?

01:37:02.612 --> 01:37:04.014
It's not a game.

01:37:04.396 --> 01:37:05.807
It's all a game.

01:37:33.633 --> 01:37:35.913
- There's something I want...
- I don't want to hear it.

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:38.715
Listen! It's hard enough for me as it is!

01:37:41.766 --> 01:37:43.723
The things you said before...

01:37:44.352 --> 01:37:45.811
You might be right.

01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:51.356
Ain't gonna mean anything
if we don't make it together.

01:37:51.651 --> 01:37:53.608
I don't think we can make it.

01:37:53.945 --> 01:37:57.230
I think if we ever get out of this dump,
I'll just split.

01:38:00.743 --> 01:38:02.358
We've made it together so far.

01:38:02.463 --> 01:38:05.787
We've come a lot of miles
but we're not close to anything.

01:38:06.249 --> 01:38:08.740
I always thought jails made people hard.

01:38:09.502 --> 01:38:13.364
Not you, boy. I mean, you're just not
tough enough to forget about Beynon.

01:38:13.467 --> 01:38:17.413
I chose you, not him, you know that?
Not that it makes any difference.

01:38:40.866 --> 01:38:42.693
We pick up or we leave it.

01:38:43.326 --> 01:38:45.996
We leave it here, there's no other way.

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:14.725
No more about him.

01:39:21.698 --> 01:39:23.240
Whatever happens...

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.785
...no more about him.

01:40:16.627 --> 01:40:19.248
$8 a day, in advance. House rules.

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:22.040
Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m.

01:40:25.428 --> 01:40:27.708
Oh, no. Would you please
carry my kitty for me?

01:40:27.812 --> 01:40:28.968
- Cat?
- Yeah.

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:30.416
What's its name?

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.709
Poor Little Harold.

01:40:31.813 --> 01:40:34.347
- That's a strange name for a pussy.
- Yeah.

01:40:38.315 --> 01:40:40.723
That's why it's kind of hard to figure.

01:40:41.527 --> 01:40:44.279
Don't hold for it. You gotta let 'em run.

01:40:44.697 --> 01:40:47.438
Dumb those goddamn horse trainers
try to rate them.

01:40:47.542 --> 01:40:49.270
Just breaks their heart.

01:40:49.374 --> 01:40:51.483
All right to put the pussy on the bed?

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:52.587
Yeah.

01:40:54.165 --> 01:40:56.241
The Lord loves a cheerful giver.

01:40:58.669 --> 01:41:00.377
Okay, now, "house rule."

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:02.575
You got two choices.

01:41:02.679 --> 01:41:05.044
- You can live or you can die.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:06.593 --> 01:41:08.632
What... what do I have to do?

01:41:09.846 --> 01:41:11.461
You have to do what I tell you to do.

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:12.635
Yes, sir.

01:41:13.808 --> 01:41:16.755
You do that and you not only get to live,
but you'll make a few dollars.

01:41:16.859 --> 01:41:17.932
Yes, sir.

01:41:19.481 --> 01:41:21.687
Now, I'm expecting Doc McCoy.

01:41:22.692 --> 01:41:24.649
- You know Doc McCoy?
- Yes, sir.

01:41:24.819 --> 01:41:27.599
Then you're gonna let me know
the minute he gets here.

01:41:27.703 --> 01:41:28.860
Yes, sir.

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.703
That's all.

01:42:08.446 --> 01:42:10.403
Rudy showed up with a broad.

01:42:14.369 --> 01:42:15.993
Laughlin's in El Paso.

01:42:16.621 --> 01:42:17.902
Rudy's there.

01:42:19.249 --> 01:42:20.743
Mexico... tonight.

01:42:21.626 --> 01:42:22.626
Two.

01:42:22.768 --> 01:42:24.745
Sure, Doc, I can do it for you.

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:27.831
Just like old times, ain't it?

01:42:28.425 --> 01:42:29.425
Yeah.

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.087
It's a nervous way to live.

01:43:12.051 --> 01:43:13.331
Hello, Jimmy.

01:43:13.927 --> 01:43:15.635
Oh, good to see you, Doc.

01:43:18.432 --> 01:43:21.091
- How's your family?
- Growing fast all the time.

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:23.261
Well, I got it all here for you.

01:43:23.479 --> 01:43:25.139
Departure and arrival.

01:43:25.606 --> 01:43:27.148
All except the $500.

01:43:28.442 --> 01:43:30.233
- I get any calls?
- No, sir.

01:43:31.362 --> 01:43:33.847
My old lady will be here
in about five minutes.

01:43:33.952 --> 01:43:36.228
I want you to get some food
and take it to the room.

01:43:36.332 --> 01:43:37.784
Just sandwiches?

01:43:37.993 --> 01:43:39.653
Yeah, that's all right.

01:43:40.662 --> 01:43:42.565
When she comes,
she'll have some luggage.

01:43:42.670 --> 01:43:44.485
Have that boy take it up to the room.

01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:46.404
Well, he took the day off.

01:43:46.508 --> 01:43:47.573
Do it yourself.

01:43:47.677 --> 01:43:50.042
I can't, Doc. I can't leave the desk.

01:43:50.464 --> 01:43:52.836
You'll be in 318, Doc, till 11:00 p.m.

01:43:54.884 --> 01:43:57.664
Nobody else is on the floor.
You're by yourself.

01:43:57.768 --> 01:43:58.925
All right.

01:44:12.194 --> 01:44:13.474
Answer it.

01:44:18.534 --> 01:44:19.576
Hello?

01:44:22.538 --> 01:44:24.162
Doc McCoy just got in.

01:44:24.415 --> 01:44:25.415
318.

01:44:26.166 --> 01:44:27.246
Yes, sir.

01:44:33.549 --> 01:44:35.209
Get up and get dressed.

01:44:47.730 --> 01:44:48.730
318.

01:45:28.978 --> 01:45:30.259
Are you ready?

01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:33.104
What are you doing?

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.277
- I'm coming in with you.
- No.

01:45:44.077 --> 01:45:45.654
Come on, honey.

01:45:51.249 --> 01:45:52.578
Come on, baby.

01:46:29.831 --> 01:46:31.408
What's the big hurry?

01:46:40.967 --> 01:46:42.165
I'm hurrying!

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.358
Five fours.

01:47:21.089 --> 01:47:22.282
What's the matter?

01:47:22.386 --> 01:47:23.620
He's a juicer.

01:47:23.724 --> 01:47:26.497
His wife and kid are always with him
to keep him off the horses...

01:47:26.601 --> 01:47:28.377
...and to keep him off the sauce.

01:47:28.481 --> 01:47:29.524
So what?

01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:32.381
So they're not here. He sent them away.

01:47:32.809 --> 01:47:35.347
Get your ass in gear, baby, and let's go.

01:47:38.899 --> 01:47:40.392
- Move it.
- Okay.

01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:56.952
Who is it?

01:47:57.416 --> 01:48:00.417
It's your food, ma'am.
I brought up the sandwiches.

01:48:03.297 --> 01:48:04.340
Stall.

01:48:05.841 --> 01:48:09.293
Just leave them outside the door.
I'm not dressed right now.

01:48:11.597 --> 01:48:12.790
I can't do that, ma'am.

01:48:12.894 --> 01:48:17.433
You must pay now 'cause I have to pay
the boy that went out to get the food.

01:48:22.066 --> 01:48:23.109
Ma'am.

01:48:25.778 --> 01:48:29.685
Listen, you're just gonna have to wait
a minute. My husband's in the shower.

01:48:29.789 --> 01:48:30.789
Okay.

01:48:39.624 --> 01:48:42.245
He'll be right out. Just wait a second.

01:49:46.649 --> 01:49:48.441
Come on, it's me, open up.

01:50:11.549 --> 01:50:12.914
I don't remember.

01:50:13.019 --> 01:50:14.457
Listen, you old bastard...

01:50:14.562 --> 01:50:16.251
...tell me what I want to hear,
or I'm gonna rip...

01:50:16.355 --> 01:50:18.416
...these fingers clear up to your elbows.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.139
Are you gonna tell me?

01:50:20.433 --> 01:50:22.170
- McCoy's in...
- What room is he in?

01:50:22.275 --> 01:50:23.884
- He's in 318.
- What? 318.

01:50:23.988 --> 01:50:26.648
You better not be lying to me, you old fool.

01:51:19.034 --> 01:51:21.359
Down the hall, Max. Around the rear.

01:51:38.969 --> 01:51:40.132
Oh, my God.

01:51:47.144 --> 01:51:48.144
Rudy!

01:51:49.688 --> 01:51:50.688
Rudy!

01:51:57.654 --> 01:51:58.654
Rudy!

01:52:02.076 --> 01:52:03.190
Bang, bang.

01:52:10.334 --> 01:52:11.334
Rudy!

01:52:14.338 --> 01:52:16.081
Where's Rudy?

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.330
Have you seen Rudy?

01:52:20.435 --> 01:52:22.917
No, I haven't seen Rudy, you dumb broad.

01:52:53.084 --> 01:52:55.123
Operator. Get me the police!

01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:30.714
Don't do it! Don't!

01:54:31.682 --> 01:54:34.089
Just run away. Just... now! Run away!

01:54:36.687 --> 01:54:38.679
- Drive!
- Sure thing, mister.

01:54:39.523 --> 01:54:41.554
- Get in there.
- Whatever you say.

01:54:41.658 --> 01:54:42.721
Want me to go, too?

01:54:42.825 --> 01:54:44.526
- Hey, are you hurt?
- No.

01:54:49.241 --> 01:54:50.616
Straight ahead.

01:54:53.495 --> 01:54:55.286
Hang in there, now, folks.

01:55:07.843 --> 01:55:09.246
Hey, how was that one?

01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:11.337
Oh, that was fine. Just fine.

01:55:12.555 --> 01:55:14.132
Where are we heading?

01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:16.098
We're going to Mexico.

01:55:24.275 --> 01:55:25.929
Can you find a nice, quiet place?

01:55:26.033 --> 01:55:27.402
Get us through?

01:55:27.862 --> 01:55:29.404
Why in the hell not?

01:55:29.697 --> 01:55:31.606
And don't hit any more cars.

01:55:35.286 --> 01:55:37.991
I don't reckon you're gonna shoot me,
are you?

01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:41.614
I kind of doubt it.

01:55:41.718 --> 01:55:42.985
Well, that's fine.

01:55:43.089 --> 01:55:45.374
Now don't you worry, I'll cooperate.

01:55:45.755 --> 01:55:48.590
Shoot, I've been in trouble
with the law myself.

01:55:51.886 --> 01:55:54.009
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:55:56.098 --> 01:55:57.098
Sure.

01:55:58.684 --> 01:56:00.226
Are you kids married?

01:56:01.312 --> 01:56:02.312
Yeah.

01:56:02.772 --> 01:56:03.971
I'm glad.

01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:06.265
Damn, you know...

01:56:06.369 --> 01:56:08.679
...that's the problem
in this goddamned world.

01:56:08.783 --> 01:56:10.438
There ain't no morals.

01:56:11.822 --> 01:56:15.322
Kids figure if they ain't living together,
they ain't living.

01:56:33.469 --> 01:56:34.963
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

01:56:35.137 --> 01:56:37.379
Chihuahua City. Building materials.

01:56:45.856 --> 01:56:46.971
Crazy.

01:56:53.864 --> 01:56:56.267
You know, if I was you kids, what I'd do?

01:56:56.371 --> 01:56:58.731
I'd quit this running around the country.

01:56:58.835 --> 01:57:01.064
You know, get a little bit
of money together...

01:57:01.169 --> 01:57:04.615
...and I'd buy a place and settle down,
and raise a family.

01:57:05.458 --> 01:57:07.866
I've been married for 35 years.

01:57:08.378 --> 01:57:11.130
Same old gal. Man, she's a tough old hide.

01:57:11.756 --> 01:57:14.294
Yeah, everything I am, I owe to her.

01:57:25.979 --> 01:57:27.022
Say...

01:57:28.148 --> 01:57:30.187
Pull over, over here, would you?

01:57:30.692 --> 01:57:32.352
Okay, whatever you say.

01:57:38.992 --> 01:57:40.071
Now what?

01:57:40.869 --> 01:57:42.529
Let's get out a spell.

01:58:14.610 --> 01:58:16.982
How much money did you make last year?

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:28.574
I reckon about $5,000.

01:58:31.419 --> 01:58:34.373
Suppose I give you $10,000
for that truck of yours?

01:58:36.049 --> 01:58:37.329
You serious?

01:58:37.467 --> 01:58:38.467
I am.

01:58:40.887 --> 01:58:42.963
And I keep my mouth shut...

01:58:43.473 --> 01:58:46.178
...and I don't say nothing about the truck...

01:58:46.559 --> 01:58:49.477
...and I never seen neither one
of the two of you?

01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:52.731
That's what I want.

01:59:03.784 --> 01:59:05.243
How about $20,000?

01:59:06.495 --> 01:59:07.954
How about $30,000?

01:59:10.207 --> 01:59:12.365
Goddamn, ma'am, you got a deal.

01:59:14.962 --> 01:59:16.670
Pay the man, honey.

01:59:20.175 --> 01:59:21.202
Thank you, ma'am.

01:59:21.307 --> 01:59:23.540
Now, you'll have to walk
on back to the border.

01:59:23.644 --> 01:59:26.306
Oh, that's all right. Don't worry about me.

01:59:32.688 --> 01:59:35.135
I hope you find what you're looking for.

01:59:35.239 --> 01:59:37.059
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

01:59:37.317 --> 01:59:38.646
You too, ma'am.

01:59:43.449 --> 01:59:44.991
Take care, you hear?

01:59:47.327 --> 01:59:48.526
Goddamn it!

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:01.620
Come on.
