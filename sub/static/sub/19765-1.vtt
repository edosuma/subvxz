I THINK THEY'LL KILL YOU
WITH THE PRESS, TOO.

36:58.792 --> 37:01.291
THEY SAY IF THE CLOWN
GETS AWAY,

37:01.291 --> 37:03.291
THEY OWE IT
TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS

37:03.291 --> 37:05.041
TO LET
THE ABJECT HUMILIATION

37:05.041 --> 37:08.166
OF THIS WHOLE THING FALL
ON A PUBLIC OFFICIAL.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.917
HOW MANY SHAREHOLDERS
ARE THERE?

37:09.917 --> 37:12.959
UH, JUST THE THREE,
I THINK.

37:12.959 --> 37:14.625
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.125
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

37:16.125 --> 37:17.792
SEE YOU ON THE BUS.

37:20.542 --> 37:24.834
OH, MY GOD.
NOW THIS ONE'S GOING.

37:24.834 --> 37:27.417
TEAR THEM DOWN NO MATTER
HOW GREAT THEY WERE.

37:27.417 --> 37:30.125
CHIEF, THE PERUVIAN
CONNECTION.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.291
THE SUBWAY PSYCHO?

37:32.291 --> 37:33.834
THE PEOPLE
ARE GONNA REMEMBER

37:33.834 --> 37:36.375
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

37:36.375 --> 37:37.583
WHAT'S SO MEMORABLE

37:37.583 --> 37:41.000
ABOUT A CLOWN
STEALING $1 MILLION?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.959
JESUS, WE GOT
TO GET THIS GUY.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.166
LOOK AT THIS.

37:54.208 --> 37:55.500
WHY DO THEY
HAVE TO DO THIS?

37:59.375 --> 38:00.834
WHAT DO I CARE?

38:00.834 --> 38:02.834
IT'S NOT MY
LIFE'S WORK ANYMORE.

38:02.834 --> 38:05.834
HEY, GRIMM, YOU TRY.
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

38:05.834 --> 38:09.333
YOU'RE CARING,
FAITHFUL, CONCERNED...

38:09.333 --> 38:11.750
AREN'T YOU?

38:11.750 --> 38:13.667
WHERE DO YOU PARK
AROUND HERE?

38:13.667 --> 38:15.375
JUST PARK
BY THE HYDRANT.

38:15.375 --> 38:16.500
A HYDRANT?

38:17.375 --> 38:19.875
I'LL PAY THE TICKET.

38:19.875 --> 38:21.625
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE NEW TENANTS

38:21.625 --> 38:23.083
DUMPED THIS STUFF HERE.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.834
THEY'RE MOVING IN
ON TUESDAY.

38:24.834 --> 38:26.750
WE SHOULD BE OUT
BY THEN.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.792
HERE, GIVE ME
YOUR SLEEVE.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.333
IS THAT REALLY
NECESSARY?

38:33.333 --> 38:35.208
WE'LL MISS OUT ON THE
COMPLIMENTARY BEVERAGE.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.875
WANT TO STAND OUT
AT THE AIRPORT?

38:37.875 --> 38:39.125
BARRY WAS 6'4".

38:39.125 --> 38:40.333
PITUITARY PROBLEM?

38:40.333 --> 38:41.959
I'M GONNA
GET ME ONE

38:41.959 --> 38:43.125
OF THESE.

38:43.125 --> 38:44.583
GET YOURSELF THREE.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.542
IT SURE WOULD
BE LESS ITCHY

38:46.542 --> 38:48.834
IF THERE'S NO
X-RAY MACHINES.

38:48.834 --> 38:50.417
SO WE COULD JUST
CARRY THE DOUGH

38:50.417 --> 38:51.625
IN A SUITCASE.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.083
THOSE DARN TERRORISTS

38:53.083 --> 38:55.583
MADE IT TOUGH
ON US BANK ROBBERS.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.917
IT'S A PRETTY NICE
JACKET.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.708
WHY DID BARRY
LEAVE THIS BEHIND?

38:59.708 --> 39:01.375
WHY DIDN'T HE TAKE IT?

39:01.375 --> 39:02.625
TOO RICH
TO CARE.

39:02.625 --> 39:04.583
THERE'S SMOKE
ACROSS THE STREET.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.500
HOW DID HE MAKE
MONEY ANYWAY?

39:06.500 --> 39:07.458
A TERMINALLY
BORING

39:07.458 --> 39:08.625
BANKER-TYPE?

39:08.625 --> 39:09.959
IT'S BLACK SMOKE.

39:09.959 --> 39:12.291
MAFIA KINGPIN?

39:12.291 --> 39:13.542
AMWAY?

39:14.417 --> 39:16.417
PIMP?

39:16.417 --> 39:18.041
OH, NO.

39:18.041 --> 39:19.417
WHAT, COPS?

39:19.417 --> 39:21.583
NO, A FIRE ENGINE.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.250
THE HYDRANT.
GIVE ME YOUR KEYS.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.875
HERE, GRIMM.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.500
GET YOUR HANDS UP.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.125
YOU MUST BE
MR. EDISON.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.667
GET THEM UP!

39:40.667 --> 39:42.625
MR. EDISON,
I'M PHYLLIS POTTER,

39:42.625 --> 39:44.667
AND THIS
IS MY APARTMENT.

39:44.667 --> 39:46.458
WE WERE RIPPED OFF
IN THE VILLAGE.

39:46.458 --> 39:47.917
IT WON'T
HAPPEN HERE.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.458
DO WE LOOK LIKE CRIMINALS?

39:49.458 --> 39:50.917
DO WE LOOK LIKE PEOPLE

39:50.917 --> 39:53.667
CAPABLE OF
COMMITTING A CRIME?

39:53.667 --> 39:55.667
WHEN MY WIFE
GETS HERE,

39:55.667 --> 39:58.166
SHE'LL CALL
THE COPS.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.291
THEY'LL DECIDE.
FACE THE WINDOW.

39:59.291 --> 40:01.125
OK. BUT IT'S STILL
OUR APARTMENT.

40:01.125 --> 40:03.000
WE'LL HAVE TO
HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.208
AW, JESUS.

40:04.208 --> 40:06.250
GRIMM, OUR PLANE
TAKES OFF

40:06.250 --> 40:07.250
IN 41 MINUTES.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.500
QUIET!

40:08.500 --> 40:09.959
NO CODES.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.291
HEY, HONEY.

40:13.291 --> 40:15.083
READY
TO CELEBRATE?

40:15.083 --> 40:16.500
OH, MY GOD.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.542
THEY WERE
RIPPING OFF THE TV

40:18.542 --> 40:19.834
WHEN I CAME IN.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.083
I WAS TOUCHING IT.
KILL ME.

40:22.083 --> 40:23.208
TURN AROUND.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.500
OH, GREAT. HAL.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.500
FOR ONCE IT WAS
GONNA BE FUN.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.417
WE WERE GONNA
EAT ON THE FLOOR,

40:30.417 --> 40:31.667
DRINK CHAMPAGNE,
LISTEN TO RECORDS.

40:31.667 --> 40:33.458
WHY ARE YOU
BLAMING ME?

40:33.458 --> 40:35.667
WE HAVEN'T EVEN
MOVED THE BED IN,

40:35.667 --> 40:37.208
AND ALREADY
IT'S THE SAME.

40:37.208 --> 40:39.792
NOW GIVE CREDIT WHERE
IT'S DUE, MRS. EDISON.

40:39.792 --> 40:41.875
HAL MADE THE COMMITMENT
AND GAVE UP

40:41.875 --> 40:44.166
THE RENT-CONTROLLED
PLACE IN THE VILLAGE.

40:44.166 --> 40:45.792
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

40:45.792 --> 40:47.333
HE'S PAYING 1,500
FOR A ONE-BEDROOM.

40:47.333 --> 40:50.875
1,500? TRY 2,600.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.125
YOU--YOU WEREN'T
PAYING 1,500,

40:54.125 --> 40:55.500
WERE YOU?

40:55.500 --> 40:57.291
WE WERE PAYING
1,260.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.792
1,260?

40:58.792 --> 41:00.542
I DON'T KNOW YOU
VERY WELL,

41:00.542 --> 41:01.583
BUT YOU'RE CRAZY

41:01.583 --> 41:04.208
IF YOU GIVE
THIS PLACE UP.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.625
MAYBE WE ARE CRAZY.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.333
WE BOUGHT A FARMHOUSE...

41:07.333 --> 41:08.708
NEAR WOODSTOCK.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.959
IT'S RUSTIC,
KIND OF A FIXER,

41:10.959 --> 41:14.291
BUT THE PAYMENTS
ARE 300 A MONTH.

41:14.291 --> 41:15.959
WE JUST...

41:15.959 --> 41:17.542
HAD TO TRY.

41:20.875 --> 41:23.000
I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT EITHER, EDISON--

41:23.000 --> 41:26.041
THAT PEOPLE WOULD GO
DO THINGS LIKE THAT?

41:26.041 --> 41:29.417
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I WAS AT WOODSTOCK.

41:29.417 --> 41:32.375
I DON'T
JUDGE YOU, HAL.

41:32.375 --> 41:35.166
REALLY, I DON'T.

41:35.166 --> 41:39.458
BUT FROM WOODSTOCK TO
CHARLES BRONSON IN 20 YEARS?

41:39.458 --> 41:41.041
Good one.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.542
LOOK.

41:47.750 --> 41:50.083
DAMN IT. DAMN IT.

41:50.959 --> 41:52.625
AW, DAMN IT!

42:02.250 --> 42:04.583
[CRASH]

42:07.583 --> 42:10.041
YOU CAN
SHOOT US NOW.

42:11.125 --> 42:13.583
I'VE PUT
THE GUN DOWN.

42:13.583 --> 42:15.792
NO HARD FEELINGS?

42:17.792 --> 42:19.417
THESE ARE THE NAMES
AND NUMBERS

42:19.417 --> 42:22.375
AND PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS
OF THE HOSTAGES.

42:22.375 --> 42:24.083
"CLOWN SEEMED HARMLESS

42:24.083 --> 42:26.333
UNTIL HE HARASSED
BLOND HOSTAGE."

42:26.333 --> 42:28.625
APPARENTLY, HE MADE
SEXUAL OVERTURES,

42:28.625 --> 42:30.000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.083
I DON'T SEE HER.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.417
DON'T SEE WHO?

42:35.417 --> 42:37.750
THE BLONDE. WHERE IS SHE?

42:41.250 --> 42:43.792
I WAS TALKING TO HER MYSELF
WHEN SHE FIRST CAME OUT.

42:43.792 --> 42:45.000
ALL THE HOSTAGES
ARE HERE.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.250
THEY'RE
ALL HERE.

42:46.250 --> 42:49.291
NO. WHERE'S THE WHINY GUY?

42:49.291 --> 42:51.333
"HE'S AN ANIMAL."

42:51.333 --> 42:54.000
THE ONE
THAT CAME OUT WITH HER.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.667
THEY WERE THE SECOND
AND THIRD ONES OUT.

42:59.583 --> 43:02.000
OH, JESUS.

43:06.208 --> 43:08.208
THE LUMBERJACK-LOOKING GUY--
HE WAS THE FIRST ONE OUT.

43:08.208 --> 43:10.708
IN ALL THAT CHAOS,
A FEW WANDERED AWAY.

43:10.708 --> 43:12.208
LOTS OF CHAOS,
CHIEF.

43:12.208 --> 43:14.000
WE GOT NAMES
AND NUMBERS.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.500
WE GOT
ALL THAT STUFF.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.458
GET ME THE NEWS FOOTAGE

43:17.458 --> 43:20.708
ON THOSE THREE HOSTAGES
WHO WERE RELEASED. RIGHT.

43:20.708 --> 43:23.000
THEN I SAID,
"IT'S ALL OVER, CHUCKLES,"

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
AND WRESTLED HIM
TO THE FLOOR.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.500
BUT HE GOT A GAL
IN HIS SIGHTS,

43:25.500 --> 43:27.834
AND I HAD TO LET UP.
THAT'S WHEN HE COLD-COCKED ME.

43:27.834 --> 43:28.959
SON OF A BITCH.

43:28.959 --> 43:32.667
WE'LL PUT OUT AN APB
ON THESE ROBBERS.

43:32.667 --> 43:33.667
ROBBERS PLURAL?

43:33.667 --> 43:35.166
THEY ALL
COLD-COCKED ME.

43:35.166 --> 43:38.375
THREE OF THEM OUT THERE,
SHOUTING WITH GLEE.

43:38.375 --> 43:39.583
TAXI!
TAXI!

43:39.583 --> 43:42.959
$10,000
FOR A TAXI!

43:42.959 --> 43:45.333
AND A BLOW JOB!

43:48.041 --> 43:49.875
CAN WE JUST CALM DOWN
A LITTLE, PLEASE?

43:49.875 --> 43:51.083
WE'LL NEVER
MAKE THE FLIGHT.

43:51.083 --> 43:53.041
WE'LL HAVE TO SAIL
A RAFT TO FIJI

43:53.041 --> 43:54.375
LIKE THOR HEYERDAHL.

43:54.375 --> 43:56.875
I HAVE MADE
ANOTHER RESERVATION

43:56.875 --> 43:58.083
ON THE 11:00
TO MARTINIQUE.

43:58.083 --> 44:00.083
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
THE 11:00 FLIGHT.

44:00.083 --> 44:02.583
I NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D NEED IT.

44:02.583 --> 44:04.708
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MARTINIQUE.

44:05.750 --> 44:08.166
WHAT DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT FIJI?

44:08.166 --> 44:09.333
NOTHING, REALLY.

44:10.208 --> 44:12.375
OK.

44:12.375 --> 44:15.250
DID YOU BOOK ANOTHER
FLIGHT AFTER THAT?

44:15.250 --> 44:18.000
LET'S JUST TRY TO
MAKE THE 11:00, OK?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.750
WHY? DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT US YET?

44:20.750 --> 44:24.083
WELL, BY NOW,
ROTZINGER

44:24.083 --> 44:25.417
HAS PROBABLY
FIGURED OUT

44:25.417 --> 44:26.625
IT WAS THE FIRST
THREE HOSTAGES.

44:26.625 --> 44:27.959
OH, GRIMM.

44:27.959 --> 44:31.083
GRIMM, I CANNOT
GO TO PRISON.

44:31.083 --> 44:33.583
DON'T WORRY. WE
WERE DISGUISED.

44:33.583 --> 44:35.375
TAXI!

44:35.375 --> 44:37.083
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
ROTZINGER.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.417
YOU NEVER
MENTIONED MARTINIQUE.

44:38.417 --> 44:39.750
TAXI!

44:39.750 --> 44:41.333
WHAT ELSE
HAVEN'T YOU MENTIONED?

44:41.333 --> 44:43.625
EVERYTHING YOU EVER TOLD ME
IS A LIE, ISN'T IT?

44:43.625 --> 44:46.250
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

44:46.250 --> 44:48.959
YOU THINK THIS IS FUN,
A NIGHT ON THE TOWN!

44:48.959 --> 44:51.750
I THINK IT'S MORE
EXCITING THAN THAT.

44:51.750 --> 44:53.125
YOU THOUGHT SO, TOO.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.917
WE COULDN'T DISCUSS
THIS PLAN

44:54.917 --> 44:56.917
UNLESS THERE WAS
A BEDROOM CLOSE BY.

44:56.917 --> 44:58.750
NOW I REALIZE
WHAT YOU ARE.

44:58.750 --> 45:00.208
WHAT AM I?

45:00.208 --> 45:02.166
YOU'RE A WORLD-CLASS
BANK ROBBER

45:02.166 --> 45:04.208
DRUNK ON YOUR POWER
AND EXPERTISE.

45:04.208 --> 45:05.875
LOOMIS
THINKS SO, TOO.

45:05.875 --> 45:07.208
TAXI!

45:07.208 --> 45:08.583
TAXI.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.417
I DON'T KNOW

45:11.417 --> 45:13.917
WHERE THIS WORLD-CLASS
BANK ROBBER THING CAME FROM.

45:13.917 --> 45:17.125
OK, I DID ROB A BANK,
BUT SO DID YOU.

45:17.125 --> 45:18.875
ISN'T THAT
WHAT WE PLANNED

45:18.875 --> 45:21.000
FOR SIX MONTHS
IN YOUR BEDROOM?

45:21.000 --> 45:23.542
AND NOW WHEN
WE GET A CAB,

45:23.542 --> 45:25.500
WE CAN COMPLETE THE PLAN

45:25.500 --> 45:27.959
AND LIVE OUT OUR LIVES
WITH A MODICUM OF DIGNITY.

45:45.792 --> 45:48.667
PLEASE, GOD!

45:48.667 --> 45:50.792
WE NEED A CAB!

45:50.792 --> 45:54.333
ONE LOUSY
FUCKING CAB!

46:08.500 --> 46:10.166
YES!

46:16.125 --> 46:18.834
TO THE AIRPORT,
PLEASE.

46:18.834 --> 46:20.083
Deejay: LET'S
TAKE ANOTHER CALL.

46:20.083 --> 46:21.834

FROM STATEN ISLAND.

46:21.834 --> 46:23.583
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND
TONIGHT, STEVE?

46:23.583 --> 46:26.375
I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THAT BANK ROBBERY.

46:26.375 --> 46:27.834
WHAT ABOUT IT?

46:27.834 --> 46:29.834
WAS THIS CLOWN
SUCH A BAD GUY?

46:29.834 --> 46:32.500
HE WASN'T ANOTHER
ONE OF THEM JUNKIES

46:32.500 --> 46:34.708
WITH A HOMEMADE 9mm.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.208
I THINK HE WAS OK.

46:36.208 --> 46:38.208
STEVE, YOU MUST BE
A SCUMBAG LIKE HIM.

46:38.208 --> 46:39.542
I SAY, HANG THE CLOWN,

46:39.542 --> 46:42.083
THEN PULL HIS PANTS
DOWN TO SET AN EXAMPLE.

46:42.083 --> 46:44.291
HOW COULD HE SAY
A THING LIKE THAT?

46:44.291 --> 46:46.875
SHH!

I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:53.041
[GROANING]

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:55.417
COME ON. I'VE GOT
A SCHEDULE TO KEEP.

01:08:55.417 --> 01:08:57.417
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.500
BEHIND THE WHITE LINE!

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.792
I'LL PAY HIS FARE.

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:03.000
FINE. YOU HAVE
EXACT CHANGE?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.500
YOU BETTER GET HELP.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
YOU'RE BECOMING
RALPH KRAMDEN'S EVIL TWIN.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.457
COME ON, SON.
COME ON.

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:09.959
LOOK,
THERE'S $6,000 HERE.

01:09:09.959 --> 01:09:14.625
I KNOW HOW THIS CITY
DEGRADES THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:16.582
IT IS APPALLING.

01:09:16.582 --> 01:09:18.542
TAKE THIS AND START
A NEW LIFE FOR YOURSELF

01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:20.250
SOMEWHERE
OFF THIS BUS, OK?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.291
YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK YOUR GUITAR.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.750
HERE YOU GO.

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:26.500
COME ON.
WE GOT A SCHEDULE.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.207
COME ON.
LET'S MOVE. COME ON.

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:32.625
WE WILL QUIETLY
PULL OVER AND BOARD

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:34.082
ALL NUMBER NINE BUSES.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:37.250
WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER
HOSTAGE SITUATION.

01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:52.375
IS THIS THE KIND
OF PERSON YOU ARE?

01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:54.166
WE LOSE TIME
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:56.166
IT'S EVERY GIRL
FOR HERSELF.

01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:57.917
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

01:09:57.917 --> 01:09:59.792
IF YOU STAY BEHIND,

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:01.417
YOU'RE GONNA
GET CAUGHT.

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.250
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:05.291
WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME

01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:06.500
WHAT I'VE DONE?

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.375
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT?

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:11.417
I JUST WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:13.542
MOVE IT!

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.125
TODAY!

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.667
HOWEVER,

01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:32.458
I WILL STAY WITH YOU
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.417
Man:   iFLORES!

01:10:40.417 --> 01:10:44.917
iFLORES PARA LOS MUERTOS!

01:10:47.917 --> 01:10:49.583
LOOMIS, WE LOST
A LITTLE TIME

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:50.959
ON THE BUS.

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:52.291
DO YOU THINK

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:53.917
YOU CAN WALK
ANY FASTER?

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:55.500
I'M SORRY, GRIMM.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.750
I CAN'T.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.959
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIT ME
AGAIN NOW, ARE YOU?

01:10:59.959 --> 01:11:01.458
NOBODY'S
GONNA HURT YOU.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.667
I HAVEN'T
HIT ANYBODY

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:03.917
SINCE I WAS 9.

01:11:03.917 --> 01:11:06.000
YEAH, BUT IT WAS ME
YOU HIT.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.458
YOU THREATENED HIM,

01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:09.458
AND HE'S BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:11.500
OH, ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.917
JUST PROMISE HIM.

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:14.041
I PROMISE.

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:16.500
Woman:   iFLORES!

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.542
iFLORES PARA LOS MUERTOS!

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.166
iFLORES!

01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:33.875
WAS THAT OUR PLANE?

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:37.208
IF IT WERE OUR PLANE,
IT WOULD BE CRASHING.

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:38.417
Woman:   iFLORES!

01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:40.041
WHERE IS THE AIRPORT?

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:42.375
HOW FAR?

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:44.250
iFLORES!

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.792
iFLORES!

01:11:46.792 --> 01:11:49.875
iFLORES PARA
LOS MUERTOS!

01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:51.041
iLOS MUERTOS!

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.875
iLOS MUERTOS!

01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:59.375
THERE MUST BE
A LOT OF COMPETITION

01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:01.375
FOR THAT CORNER.

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:03.875
THANK GOD SHE'S NOT
TOO SYMBOLIC OR ANYTHING.

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:07.375
WHAT DOES IT MEAN ANYWAY,
"FLORES PORLOS MORTOS?"

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:09.417
I SURE
COULDN'T TELL YOU.

01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:10.625
YOU KNOW, GRIMM.

01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:13.041
IT MEANS FLOWERS
FOR THE DEAD.

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:18.583
OH, GOD!

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:21.083
WE'RE ALL
GONNA DIE!

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.917
WE'RE ALL
GONNA DIE!

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:27.542
GIVE HIM A MOMENT.

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:29.959
HE'S GETTING
HIS SECOND WIND.

01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:51.917
WAIT. PHYLLIS CAN'T
RIDE ON THAT THING,

01:12:51.917 --> 01:12:54.250
NOT IN HER CONDITION.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:03.208
HOLD ON
TO YOUR TRANSFER.

01:13:03.208 --> 01:13:05.792
YOU'LL NEED A TRANSFER
TO REBOARD.

01:13:05.792 --> 01:13:07.458
[SIREN]

01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:08.708
HOLD ON
TO YOUR TRANSFER.

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:11.458
YOU'LL NEED A TRANSFER
TO REBOARD.

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:13.250
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:14.625
MOVE RIGHT ALONG.

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:16.625
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO HEAR THIS ONE.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.792
GOT SOMETHING?

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:19.667
DAMN RIGHT I DO.

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:30.417
WE'RE GOING
TO THE AIRPORT.

01:13:30.417 --> 01:13:31.625
I'M TAKING YOUR CAR.

01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:34.291
I NEED HIM
TO MAKE AN I.D.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.667
YOU WEREN'T EVEN
GONNA TELL ME?

01:13:49.667 --> 01:13:52.667
I WANTED TO, BUT WHEN,
BEFORE THE BANK?

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:54.667
JUST TO ADD
SOME PRESSURE?

01:13:54.667 --> 01:13:56.333
THEN WHAT ABOUT AFTER?

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:59.291
I TRIED TO TELL YOU
SEVERAL TIMES,

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:02.125
BUT YOU WERE TOO
BUSY BEING COMPLETE.

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:05.000
GRIMM, I GOT TO GET
THIS MONEY OFF MY BODY.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.708
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET YOU A DUFFEL BAG

01:14:07.708 --> 01:14:10.333
AFTER WE GET PAST
THE X-RAY MACHINES.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.875
HOW MANY MONTHS?

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.208
PHYLLIS, PLEASE.

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:19.166
THEY HAVEN'T
BOARDED YET.

01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:20.667
LET THEM BOARD.

01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:22.041
THEY'LL PASS
THE METAL DETECTORS.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.917
THEY'LL BE TRAPPED
AND UNARMED.

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:25.542
I'LL MAKE THE ARREST
ON BOARD

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:26.708
QUIETLY AND ALONE

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:28.708
BEFORE THEY KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:14:28.708 --> 01:14:30.417
Grimm:
IT'S MY BABY, TOO!

01:14:30.417 --> 01:14:32.917
THIS IS A FAIRLY
YOUNG GUY.

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:35.458
I'VE GOT TRAINED
ANTITERRORIST SQUADS

01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:36.834
WHO ARE PREPARED TO DEAL

01:14:36.834 --> 01:14:38.208
WITH THIS
KIND OF THING.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:40.208
I WANT THIS.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:43.917
FRANKLY, I NEED IT
AFTER TODAY.

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:45.041
GOT IT.

01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:48.041
ROY'S GONNA GET US
THE DUFFEL BAG,

01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.250
A WHEELCHAIR,
AND SOME SKIS

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:52.834
FROM LOST LUGGAGE
TO COVER YOUR LIMP.

01:14:52.834 --> 01:14:54.375
DID YOU GIVE HIM
A COUPLE OF BUCKS?

01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:55.875
TRY 1,200.

01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.417
SCARY, BUT ROY'S
SIXTH SENSE

01:14:57.417 --> 01:15:00.417
TOLD HIM WE WERE
IN A JAM.

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:02.208
ESP EXISTS.
YOU PROVED IT.

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:03.375
PICKING UP
ANYTHING

01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:04.500
FROM ME
RIGHT NOW?

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500
I'M GONNA GET
BOARDING PASSES.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.250
WILL I SEE YOU THERE?

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.750
I'LL MAKE SURE

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.792
THE AMAZING KRESKIN
GETS INSIDE.

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:13.959
NOW WHAT?

01:15:17.917 --> 01:15:19.750
HEY, CLOWN!

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.000
GET THE HELL
BACK IN LINE.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.250
I JUST HAVE
ONE QUESTION.

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:28.708
IS THERE
A PROBLEM, SIR?

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.583
TOO MANY PASSENGERS,
I'M AFRAID.

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:32.417
YEAH, YOU'D
BETTER BE AFRAID.

01:15:32.417 --> 01:15:34.417
NOBODY DOES THIS
TO RUSS CRANE.

01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:36.125
NOBODY DOES THIS
TO MRS. RUSS CRANE,

01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:37.792
YOU GLORIFIED
STEWARDESS, YOU!

01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:39.583
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:42.291
YOU AFRAID TO DO
A MAN'S JOB?

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.583
RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

01:15:43.583 --> 01:15:44.667
NAME, PLEASE?

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:47.250
THANK YOU, YES.
GRIMM.

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:23.625
COPS ARE LOOKING
FOR TWO MEN AND A WOMAN,

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.417
SO LET'S SPLIT UP.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:26.625
I'LL SAY GOOD-BYE NOW.

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.375
ARE YOU CRAZY?

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.458
DO YOU THINK
THIS IS EASY?

01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:32.041
WHAT DID I DO
YOU DIDN'T DO?

01:16:32.041 --> 01:16:33.834
YOU TURNED INTO
JIMMY CAGNEY.

01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:36.667
THAT BANK WAS JUST
A SPRINGBOARD.

01:16:36.667 --> 01:16:38.667
YOU RIPPED OFF
THE MOB,

01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:39.875
YOU BRIBED ROY,

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:42.166
YOU DEMORALIZED
THAT GUY EDISON,

01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:43.875
AND HE HAD THE GUN.

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:45.625
YOU STOLE
THAT WATCH.

01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:47.041
I BOUGHT THE WATCH.

01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:48.875
THE EDISONS
WILL HAVE BETTER SEX

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.500
THAN THEY'VE HAD
SINCE ALTAMONT.

01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:53.708
WHATEVER I DID,

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:56.166
I DID IT SO WE COULD
ALL LEAVE HERE TOGETHER.

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:59.875
YOU THINK I SHOULD JUST
BE A BUMBLING IDIOT?

01:16:59.875 --> 01:17:01.375
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE ABLE

01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:03.333
TO GO BACK
TO WHAT YOU WERE.

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:05.834
I'M NOT GOING BACK.
I'M GOING TO MARTINIQUE

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.375
WITH A MILLION BUCKS
TAPED TO MY BUTT,

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:09.667
UNLESS YOU KEEP
SCREWING AROUND.

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.959
WE'LL ALL GO TO JAIL.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:13.959
GRIMM, I'M THINKING
OF THE BABY.

01:17:13.959 --> 01:17:15.792
HE'LL BE 3
WHEN YOU GET OUT.

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.083
FOSTER FAMILIES
ARE GREAT,

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:19.625
OTHER THAN MERCENARIES
OR RELIGIOUS NUTS.

01:17:19.625 --> 01:17:21.041
HE'LL VISIT.

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:22.792
YOU'LL SHOW HIM
LICENSE PLATE-MAKING.

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:25.417
JESUS. THANK GOD
YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO ME

01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:26.667
WITH LOVE
AND UNDERSTANDING

01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:29.166
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO SCARE ME.

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:30.208
IT'S ALL
I HAVE TIME FOR.

01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:33.375
ONE OF US HAS
TO TAKE LOOMIS

01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:34.542
AND PUSH HIM.

01:17:34.542 --> 01:17:36.750
WHY DON'T YOU?

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:39.000
THE MEN'S ROOM, GRIMM.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.291
I'M GONNA FREAK OUT

01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:42.542
IF I DON'T GET
THIS MONEY OFF ME.

01:17:42.542 --> 01:17:43.917
OH, SHIT.

01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:48.875
MEET ME ON THE PLANE
IN TWO MINUTES, OK?

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:52.917
PLEASE?

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:09.417
YOU WERE HARD ON HER.

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.667
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:12.875
TO MAKE SURE
IN THE TIME ALLOTTED.

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:14.250
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD HER YOU LOVED HER.

01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:17.458
MAYBE THAT WAS THE WAY
TO MAKE SURE.

01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:20.750
OH, JESUS, LOOMIS.
NOW YOU TELL ME.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.458
OH!

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:31.250
ALL RIGHT.
JUST ONCE MORE.

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:33.000
NO.
