WEBVTT

00:25.526 --> 00:26.527
Goodness.

00:30.822 --> 00:31.823
Wow.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.747
We're here!

00:53.929 --> 00:56.765
All right, folks. Let's go see
what this opera craze is all about.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.435
Everyone looks so elegant.
I should have worn my cape.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.105
I'm starving. You think they have popcorn?

01:03.689 --> 01:06.191
They don't have popcorn at the opera,
Ship.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.069
I am so excited to finally be here.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.155
I've read all the reviews
of the Italian production.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.615
I'm overwrought.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.409
Why do you always use such big words?

01:15.951 --> 01:18.787
This better be entertaining.
Tickets cost me an arm and a leg.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.456
-I just hope we have good seats.
-Look, there's Sue and Austin.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.749
Hey!

01:22.833 --> 01:25.377
Of course. She wore her cape.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.837
-Hi.
-Wow.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.465
Sue, you look incredible.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.758
So do all of you.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.136
-Yeah, how was Aunt Lavinia's?
-She has mice.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.846
How was the hotel?

01:35.929 --> 01:36.972
It was fine.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.392
I mean, good enough for a night or two.
I wouldn't stay there for longer.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.020
Yes, I don't think you could
afford to stay there for much longer.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.856
So, is everyone excited?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.774
Here we are at opening night,

01:47.858 --> 01:50.194
and all of Boston
is buzzing about the lead soprano.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.654
Yes. The magnificent Adelaide May.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.949
Fresh off the boat from Italy
where she trained with Verdi himself.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.744
She's originally from Philadelphia,
you know.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.163
Most Americans, of course,
can't sing opera,

02:01.246 --> 02:03.707
but Adelaide has dazzled
all of Europe with her voice.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.877
They say she once shattered
a reviewer's monocle with a high C.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.961
No!

02:08.044 --> 02:10.047
That's a myth. That has to be a myth.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.425
He came.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.058
Dickinsons.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.851
-Hey.
-Welcome to the opera.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.520
We are so happy to be here.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.189
I think I just
saw someone I know downstairs.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.857
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.402
That was abrupt.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.821
Sam, thank you so much
for your help with the tickets.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.657
We're thrilled to be up in that box.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.950
Wait a minute.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.326
Where are we sitting?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.620
Orchestra. Back row.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.747
Why didn't you get us a box?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.167
Yes. First, you stick me in a hole.
Now, you try to put me in a box.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.877
The orchestra is very good too.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.170
I'm sure it is.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.798
Come on, Edward,
let's go find the back row.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.675
Okay, let's go.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.176
Emily, you coming with us?

02:56.885 --> 02:58.720
I just have to talk to Sue.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.722
-Arrivederci.
-Si. Bye. Si. Yes.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.851
Okay. So, I'll see you after the show?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.561
No, Sam, wait. Don't go.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.771
I thought you wanted to talk.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.151
No, not really.
I just want to talk to you.

03:13.777 --> 03:14.736
Okay.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.613
Of course.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.449
The poet needs a word with her editor.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.701
Okay.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.037
Sam, you're not here alone, are you?
Where is Mary?

03:24.121 --> 03:26.331
She couldn't come.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.542
What a shame. I'm dying to see her.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.628
Yes. Well, she wasn't feeling very well.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.130
Again.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.550
Well, I guess
it's a lucky break for Emily.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.719
For me?

03:38.802 --> 03:41.013
Yes, because now
you can sit with Sam in his box.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.266
-I really think that--
-Sam, she has to.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.811
It's her first time at the opera,
and Adelaide May is performing.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.563
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.982
Especially for such
a sensitive artist as Emily.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.278
If it's all right,
I'd love to sit with you.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.572
You absolutely must!

03:58.655 --> 04:00.908
Sam, be a gentleman. Let her sit with you.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.368
If she's down there
all the way in the back,

04:03.452 --> 04:05.078
she won't even be able to see.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.247
Remember, she has eye troubles.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.874
Iritis.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.212
All right, well, I suppose
there's no point in having an empty seat.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.296
Come on.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.357
Hey.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.570
Who's that next to Sam Bowles?

04:38.654 --> 04:40.197
Wow, a new one.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.830
I can't wait to hear
this Adelaide May sing tonight.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.542
Everyone says she's really got the chops.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.877
Sings like a lark, they tell me.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.003
I can't wait.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.800
"International singing sensation."
That's what it says on the poster.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.845
Apparently,
she's a sweetheart in person too.

05:02.928 --> 05:03.929
Really?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.809
I'm supposed to
interview her after the show.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.562
You get to go backstage?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.355
Of course.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.942
This is a new opera house.
They need the press.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.028
This is so incredible.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.828
Look.

05:28.704 --> 05:29.705
Hey, Mom!

05:35.002 --> 05:36.211
What took you so long?

05:37.212 --> 05:39.298
You'll never believe
who I ran into at the bar.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.966
Who?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.593
Frazar Stearns.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.012
Who's that?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.431
Frazar. My old buddy from school.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.516
Great guy. Son of the college president.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.935
You must remember him.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.521
Yes. Sort of.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.065
Come on. Frazar Stearns.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.568
Sweetest guy in the world.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.447
Haven't seen him since we graduated.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.199
He's at West Point now.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.159
He's wearing his uniform.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.203
Looked like a real soldier.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.664
God, I miss the old gang.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.792
Maybe I should organize a reunion.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.797
Those were the days, man.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.301
We used to have such good times.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.763
You still have good times. Don't you?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.827
"La traviata." It means "the fallen one."

06:50.911 --> 06:52.162
Yeah, I knew that.

06:52.955 --> 06:56.041
-You did?
-I studied Italian in college, okay?

06:56.124 --> 06:57.960
Yeah, but you dropped out.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.380
Okay. Whatever.

07:02.256 --> 07:07.719
You know, people's reaction to opera the
first time they see it is very dramatic.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.264
They either love it or hate it.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.850
If they love it, they will always love it.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.477
If they don't,
they may learn to appreciate it,

07:15.561 --> 07:18.188
but it will never
become part of their soul.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.275
Cool.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.569
I gotta take a piss.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.488
You just went.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.949
Lavinia, I'm aware.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.583
Is he going to wear that hat
through the whole show?

07:37.666 --> 07:38.917
What a rip-off.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.878
We can't even see.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.629
All these people are so...

07:43.380 --> 07:46.425
Yes. Good. Yes, sure.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.260
...pretentious.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.056
Is the whole thing going to be in Italian?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.392
Oh, my God.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.477
Italian.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.899
I sort of wish
we were seeing some vaudeville.

08:02.900 --> 08:03.901
Yes.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.198
You've really never been to the opera?

08:09.281 --> 08:12.117
No. No, I've only ever dreamt of it.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.746
Well, I guess your dreams are coming true.

08:17.289 --> 08:20.000
So many of my dreams
have come true since I've met you.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.421
-Emily--
-Sam, I just have to thank you.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.633
Don't mention it. It's nothing.
I didn't even pay for this box.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.134
Oh, no, not for that.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.136
Not just for that.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.138
-I mean, for all of it.
-Emily, please--

08:33.222 --> 08:35.557
-For what you've given me.
-Please, it's nothing.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.226
It's everything.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.772
You changed my life.
Before I met you, I was nobody.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.107
Now...

08:45.108 --> 08:46.735
Now my poem will be published.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.370
Emily, we have a problem.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.457
We do?

09:00.541 --> 09:01.542
Yeah.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.377
You...

09:04.962 --> 09:06.380
You wrote a letter to Mary.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.592
Yes.

09:11.844 --> 09:12.845
I did.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.307
Yeah. That wasn't a good move.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.397
But I-- What do you mean?

09:23.480 --> 09:28.110
You wrote a letter to Mary, and it
made her feel extremely uncomfortable.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.571
Both of us, I should say.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.614
It made both of us uncomfortable.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.158
Your letter upset Mary so much.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.537
That's the reason why
she's not here tonight.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.459
She refused to come because
your letter made her feel so violated.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.381
I don't understand.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.466
You wrote the craziest shit
in that letter.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.219
You said I was like the sun.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.555
Like you're cold whenever I'm not there.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.517
Like every time I leave Amherst,
winter sets in.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.936
Why would you write something like that?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.104
Because it's how I feel.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.606
About a married man?

10:06.982 --> 10:08.192
To his wife?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.528
I didn't mean to upset her.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.030
I was only trying to express

10:13.113 --> 10:14.573
-my gratitude, my admiration--
-Yes, well--

10:14.656 --> 10:16.533
Listen, you went
a little too far this time.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.618
I'm sorry.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.748
Sometimes when I write... I lose control.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.631
I know. It's part of
what makes you a great writer.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.260
But you have to
be aware of all the rumors.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.389
-What rumors?
-Come on, you've heard them.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.310
Every time I choose
to support a female voice

10:43.393 --> 10:46.772
all the gossips on the East Coast
think I have ulterior motives.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.234
And Mary, she hears these whispers...

10:51.568 --> 10:52.778
and they upset her.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.821
They hurt her...

10:55.739 --> 10:59.159
even though she knows, in her soul,
I am always faithful to her.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.872
Now I've tried
to make myself absolutely clear.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.167
This interest that I've taken in you?

11:08.377 --> 11:10.212
It is purely professional.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.383
You do understand that, don't you?

11:16.260 --> 11:17.261
Of course.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.641
Mary is the only woman on Earth for me.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.186
I would never betray her.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.479
Sam, please forgive me.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.190
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.484
I have the utmost respect
for your marriage.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.613
The fact that you are so faithful
to your wife is one of the things

11:36.697 --> 11:38.448
that makes you such a great man.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.207
Look, I know it's romantic...

11:48.834 --> 11:50.460
to have your poem get published,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.547
especially when
you've had to wait for so long.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.925
But you have to remember, Emily,

11:58.594 --> 11:59.803
the romance...

12:01.680 --> 12:04.892
it's between you and yourself.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.515
Looks like one of your parties.

13:22.886 --> 13:23.887
I'm sorry.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.404
This is so boring.

13:40.487 --> 13:45.158
I know. But, God, I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.932
She has tuberculosis.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.818
Ship, not at the opera.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.825
Go, go, go.

14:27.743 --> 14:30.621
We're free. We're free!

14:30.704 --> 14:33.290
Oh, my God, that was awful! It was awful.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.751
Oh, free-oh. La garbage-iata.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.461
La garbage-iata!

14:37.544 --> 14:39.880
Let's get out of here!

14:39.963 --> 14:41.590
-Bravo, bravo!
-Oh, my God.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.050
Please! Let's leave.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.177
Let's go.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.875
She's riveting, isn't she?

15:20.504 --> 15:23.131
My heart feels
like it could split right open.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.643
I have to go.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.061
What? Right now?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.145
I shouldn't have come.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.605
Mary needs me. I need to go home.

15:38.689 --> 15:39.690
Sam, wait!

15:44.945 --> 15:46.363
I wrote something for you.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.786
Keep it.

17:06.609 --> 17:12.574
Split the lark

17:14.576 --> 17:19.414
And you'll find the music

17:21.458 --> 17:23.919
Bulb after Bulb

17:24.002 --> 17:28.464
In Silver rolled

17:28.882 --> 17:29.883
Sue...

17:31.426 --> 17:37.224
Scantily dealt
To the summer morning

17:38.141 --> 17:40.269
Saved for your Ear

17:40.352 --> 17:44.815
When Lutes be old

17:48.443 --> 17:54.241
Loose the Flood
You shall find it patent

17:55.242 --> 18:01.415
Gush after Gush
Reserved for you

18:02.165 --> 18:08.088
Scarlet Experiment!
Sceptic Thomas!

18:09.047 --> 18:11.091
Now, do you doubt

18:11.175 --> 18:17.723
That your bird was true?

18:18.932 --> 18:25.189
Split the Lark
And you'll find the music

18:26.315 --> 18:33.238
Bulb after Bulb
In Silver rolled

18:42.623 --> 18:43.832
Bravissimo!

19:17.449 --> 19:19.284
Are you going to fetch the carriage?

19:20.327 --> 19:22.162
No, I'm going to go meet Frazar.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.706
He told me to find him
after the show for a drink.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.501
So, what?

19:27.584 --> 19:28.836
You're leaving me here?

19:29.753 --> 19:31.922
You can take the carriage
back to the hotel.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.298
Alone?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.676
Or with whoever you want.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.871
Coming through! Excuse me.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.342
Are you looking for someone?

20:17.968 --> 20:20.220
Yes, I'm looking for Adelaide May.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.014
Of course you are.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.850
She's in her dressing room,
but I wouldn't bother her if I were you.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.977
Who are you? Friend of hers?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.062
No, I'm a writer.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.732
What kind of writer?

20:32.608 --> 20:34.443
A newspaper reporter.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.070
See, I'm with the press.

20:37.154 --> 20:40.407
A girl reporter? I never heard of that.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.284
Yes, I'm with The Springfield Republican.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.287
Well, they're really keeping up
with the times here in Massachusetts.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.455
I need a drink.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.539
Who doesn't?

20:47.623 --> 20:50.042
You want to come have a drink with us,
girl reporter?

20:50.125 --> 20:52.753
Yeah! You can write about us.
We're fascinating.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.339
No, I'm supposed to
interview Adelaide May.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.050
Adelaide doesn't give interviews.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.635
Everyone already knows who she is.

20:59.718 --> 21:03.305
That's right. See, interviews are
for desperate people like us.

21:03.388 --> 21:06.725
The real stars, they can just hide.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.417
Who is it?

21:34.169 --> 21:35.170
It's...

21:36.630 --> 21:37.631
me.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.216
Well, come in.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.427
Come in if you're coming in.
Shut the door behind you fast.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.932
I'm not in the mood
to be bombarded tonight.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.977
My throat hurts,
I don't want to sign autographs.

21:50.060 --> 21:53.230
I know, it's terrible,
but I don't have the energy.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.566
The fans are so overwhelming.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.777
They love me so much
it's like they wanna kill me.

21:59.278 --> 22:01.905
It's all just too exhausting.
I can't do it tonight.

22:02.865 --> 22:04.074
I'm sorry to intrude.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.034
No, you're only doing your job.

22:06.118 --> 22:09.121
You're the wardrobe girl, aren't you?
I'm ready to undress.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.625
I'm actually--

22:14.293 --> 22:15.502
I'm just...

22:17.629 --> 22:20.257
I'm just here to tell you
how amazing you are.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.758
You're one of them.

22:23.719 --> 22:25.304
I was in the audience tonight.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.471
Your singing...

22:26.555 --> 22:28.473
I have never heard anything like it.

22:28.557 --> 22:31.310
It was so beautiful, it broke my heart.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.937
Yes, that's what they all say.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.230
No, but I mean it.

22:36.315 --> 22:40.527
Listening to you made me feel things
that I have never felt before.

22:40.611 --> 22:42.029
Really? What's that like?

22:42.696 --> 22:43.697
What?

22:43.780 --> 22:44.990
Feeling things.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.077
Well, you must know what it's like.

22:50.204 --> 22:52.706
You brought it all to life so perfectly.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.835
You made me feel
what Violetta was feeling.

22:56.919 --> 22:58.921
That was just a performance.

22:59.963 --> 23:04.051
I've done Violetta so many times, I don't
even need to be awake when I'm on stage.

23:05.177 --> 23:09.139
You just saw the most moving performance,
and yet I felt nothing.

23:11.183 --> 23:14.937
Here, have a seat if you're staying.
I can't stand people hovering around me.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.356
That is impossible. You were crying.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.234
Those were real tears.

23:20.317 --> 23:21.318
Were they?

23:21.985 --> 23:23.445
I don't know what's real anymore.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.865
I don't even know what city this is.
Is this Paris? Or Rome?

23:28.742 --> 23:31.828
It doesn't matter. Every night's the same.

23:32.955 --> 23:35.249
Just a blur. A dream.

23:36.166 --> 23:41.213
Another person falling in love with me,
another drink, another round of applause.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.216
So many people
have fallen in love with me.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.425
I've lost track.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.053
I lose track of reality.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.346
What is reality?

23:50.013 --> 23:51.306
Who am I?

23:51.390 --> 23:52.808
You're Adelaide May.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.769
The world's greatest soprano.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.522
That's not my real name.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.023
It's just a stage name.

24:01.817 --> 24:07.281
Well, whatever your name is,
you changed my life tonight.

24:11.201 --> 24:14.413
Your voice will haunt me forever.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.085
There's no such thing as forever.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.629
Don't you know that, darling?

24:24.047 --> 24:27.092
The voice fades. Then memory fades.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.887
Things go in and out of fashion.

24:29.970 --> 24:33.182
Time goes on, and all of us,
eventually, are forgotten.

24:34.975 --> 24:38.395
Well, I am not going to forget you.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.443
Would you like to see the stage?

24:45.485 --> 24:46.486
Really?

24:48.947 --> 24:49.948
Come with me.

24:52.868 --> 24:56.079
We're not supposed to be on the stage
when it's dark, but I don't care.

24:56.997 --> 24:58.207
It's a lark.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.922
It's beautiful.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.925
Yes. I like it better when no one's here.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.491
Bravo!

25:39.414 --> 25:40.415
Emily!

25:41.834 --> 25:43.836
Go, Emily!

25:58.308 --> 25:59.518
I want to be famous.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.187
You do?

26:02.271 --> 26:03.647
Sure. Doesn't everybody?

26:04.273 --> 26:05.941
Why do you want to be famous?

26:07.401 --> 26:08.861
Because I'm a writer.

26:09.778 --> 26:13.740
And I write and write poem after poem,
and then I stick it in a drawer,

26:14.283 --> 26:18.537
and it just sits there in the dark,
where no light shines.

26:20.414 --> 26:21.790
I mean, that isn't enough.

26:22.207 --> 26:23.208
Is it?

26:24.543 --> 26:26.962
Don't they need to be seen?
Don't I need to be...

26:27.880 --> 26:28.881
seen?

26:30.883 --> 26:31.884
I don't know.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.802
If you're seen, then you're exposed.

26:34.678 --> 26:38.599
Everything that's exposed,
well, it goes stale.

26:40.142 --> 26:41.268
Well, not everything.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.978
Yes, everything.

26:43.395 --> 26:46.732
The critics, they'll put you on top for
a minute, but then they'll drag you down.

26:48.066 --> 26:50.485
They'll get sick of you,
and they'll destroy you.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.698
They hate you, see,
because you made them love you.

26:56.575 --> 27:00.829
You were a courtesan,
and they fell for your trick.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.459
Well, who cares what they say?
Who cares what people think?

27:06.126 --> 27:07.127
Exactly.

27:07.961 --> 27:10.797
Might as well stay in a room by yourself
with no one watching.

27:15.344 --> 27:16.553
How do you do it?

27:17.846 --> 27:22.351
How do you find the courage
to sing in front of all these people?

27:22.976 --> 27:25.395
Well, I just pretend they're not there.

27:27.481 --> 27:29.483
But I was here tonight.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.444
I was here.

27:35.072 --> 27:37.741
Well, then I suppose
I was singing for you.

27:44.873 --> 27:46.416
What is it that you really want?

27:47.292 --> 27:48.961
What is the deeper yearning that you have?

27:49.044 --> 27:51.463
Sue. What do you mean?

27:51.547 --> 27:57.719
Beneath all of this nonsense about fame,
what is it that you crave?

27:59.805 --> 28:01.014
You crave meaning.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.225
You crave beauty.

28:05.811 --> 28:07.020
You crave love.

28:09.273 --> 28:15.737
Split the Lark

28:16.780 --> 28:23.370
And you'll find the Music

28:42.347 --> 28:44.558
Hey! What are you doing there?

28:45.934 --> 28:47.144
Clear the stage.

28:49.521 --> 28:52.608
Clear the stage this minute,
or I shall have to report you.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.279
You don't even know who I am.
