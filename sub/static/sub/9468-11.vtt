Peter, Peter. Come on.

Peter, Peter, Peter,
Peter, Peter, come on.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.813
(cat purring)
Yeah, I know.

02:18.854 --> 02:21.274
Yeah, I'm not usually a worrier,

02:21.316 --> 02:23.568
but this time, you know?

02:23.610 --> 02:26.027

02:39.918 --> 02:41.919

02:41.961 --> 02:44.673
One of your deputies told me
I might find you here.

02:44.713 --> 02:47.008
The man's been up all night.

02:47.049 --> 02:50.051
Leave him in peace.

02:50.093 --> 02:52.973
Listen, Tom,
I can't begin to imagine

02:53.013 --> 02:56.391
what you're going through.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.812
Give us a minute.

03:08.153 --> 03:11.616
You know, it's hard
to believe...

03:11.657 --> 03:15.286
Alisha and I used to come here
before the twins.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.997
We'd drink...

03:18.038 --> 03:20.290
dance to the shittiest music.

03:22.585 --> 03:24.545
How's your family, Norman?

03:24.586 --> 03:26.840
My family?

03:26.882 --> 03:29.425
Marie, Letha.
They all right?

03:29.467 --> 03:32.637
They're the same.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.848
Come home with me.

03:34.889 --> 03:36.974
You shouldn't be alone
at a time like this.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.352
He look fucking alone to you?

03:48.110 --> 03:50.237
She sat right there.

03:52.407 --> 03:55.283
Who?

03:55.325 --> 03:57.537
Dr. Chasseur.

03:57.579 --> 03:59.914
Fish and Wildlife.

03:59.955 --> 04:02.876
Had a bug up her ass
with the Rumancek kid.

04:02.918 --> 04:04.877
Tom, whatever she told you--

04:04.919 --> 04:08.338
- She as much as accused him
of being a werewolf.

04:08.381 --> 04:12.133
Me being a civilized man,
I laughed it off.

04:12.175 --> 04:15.638
As you should
since it's bloody ridiculous.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.639
She called me
about a hair sample,

04:17.682 --> 04:20.141
male. What the hell
was I supposed to do with that?

04:20.183 --> 04:22.144
(Norman sighs.)

04:22.185 --> 04:24.146
Listen.

04:24.187 --> 04:26.858
There is an explanation
for this

04:26.899 --> 04:30.235
and it's not the supernatural.

04:32.237 --> 04:33.740
OK.

04:33.781 --> 04:36.076
Good.

04:37.326 --> 04:39.286
Let's go.

04:39.327 --> 04:42.415
I just...

04:42.456 --> 04:45.584
- Tom.
- No. No.

04:45.627 --> 04:48.295
Fuck it.

04:48.336 --> 04:50.882
We all know that these killings

04:50.923 --> 04:52.925
started after these Rumanceks
moved in.

04:52.968 --> 04:54.927
You're just buying
into this madness.

04:54.970 --> 04:57.305
The town's riled up as it is.

04:57.346 --> 04:59.307
Think about Christina.

04:59.348 --> 05:01.935
I am.

05:04.019 --> 05:07.482
Down by the creek, Kimmel Lane.

05:07.523 --> 05:09.442
That's where they fucking live.

05:16.031 --> 05:18.076

(frogs croaking)

05:18.117 --> 05:19.911
(phone ringing)

05:21.913 --> 05:25.415
- Destiny: [Lynda, I have a bad feeling.]
- Huh?

05:25.458 --> 05:28.377
Here we go! Woo!

05:28.418 --> 05:30.379
- Yeah, party time.
- Yeah, let's go!

05:30.420 --> 05:33.173
Oh, shit!
They're already here.

05:33.214 --> 05:35.802
- Woo!
- Hey, anybody home?

05:35.843 --> 05:38.346
- Come on out.
- Yeah! Come on!

05:40.555 --> 05:42.850
Yeehaw!

05:42.891 --> 05:45.769
(windows breaking)
Yeah, baby!

05:45.812 --> 05:48.064
Knock! Knock! Anybody home?

06:21.555 --> 06:24.516
Wasn't so bad now, was it?

06:24.559 --> 06:27.353
Your dogcatcher
has been taken care of.

06:27.394 --> 06:29.814
Will there be anything else?

06:29.855 --> 06:32.942
Not yet.

06:35.276 --> 06:37.779
Though I really...

06:37.822 --> 06:40.490
must change first.

07:05.307 --> 07:07.392
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's OK.

07:07.435 --> 07:10.980
It's OK. You're OK.

07:11.021 --> 07:13.524
You're OK.

07:15.526 --> 07:17.612
I saw it.

07:17.653 --> 07:20.740
I mean I saw you.

07:20.781 --> 07:22.824
Wh-what?

07:22.867 --> 07:25.161
Changing back from...
you know.

07:25.202 --> 07:28.206
It was fucking beautiful.

07:30.208 --> 07:33.043
If you say so.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.004
Ahhh...

07:35.045 --> 07:37.839
My head feels like a goddamn

07:37.882 --> 07:40.259
war dance is inside of it.

07:42.595 --> 07:46.141
Did you drag me back here?

07:46.182 --> 07:48.309
Last I saw, you were down.

07:48.350 --> 07:51.603
- Down?
- Chasseur shot you with a dart.

07:51.646 --> 07:55.649
Oh, Chasseur!

07:55.690 --> 07:57.567
She was gonna take you away.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.946
I, I tried to tell her
how it wasn't you but...

07:59.987 --> 08:02.865
Fuck! Fuck!

08:02.906 --> 08:04.533
What?

08:04.574 --> 08:06.619
I should have been stronger
for you.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.706
- Stronger?
- I tried to stop her,

08:10.747 --> 08:13.459
I did, but she had a gun.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.047
So I left.
But then I circled back,

08:18.088 --> 08:20.132
but by then you were gone.

08:20.175 --> 08:23.802
Then my fucking mom calls,

08:23.845 --> 08:26.555
says to come back home
and keep an eye on you.

08:28.932 --> 08:32.187
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

08:32.227 --> 08:34.188
Two weeks in a fucking coma,
and she didn't even ask me

08:34.230 --> 08:36.231
how I felt. Weird, huh?

08:36.274 --> 08:39.527
- I'm, I'm no judge.
- Anyway...

08:39.567 --> 08:41.903
I get back home
and there you are,

08:41.946 --> 08:44.865
but she's gone.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.499
There's something else.

08:53.541 --> 08:56.126
- Letha?
- No, no, no.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.379
She's fine.

08:59.421 --> 09:01.465
Alexa and Alyssa Sworn?

09:01.506 --> 09:04.219
The vargulf got
the sheriff's daughters.

09:07.013 --> 09:10.932
Shit.

09:10.975 --> 09:13.019
Have you heard from my mom?

09:13.061 --> 09:15.062
What do you mean?

09:15.104 --> 09:17.105
Fuckers know about me,
they gotta know about her.

09:17.148 --> 09:19.567
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey! Stay here. Stay here.

09:19.607 --> 09:22.110
I'll check on the trailer,
make sure she's all right, OK?

09:22.153 --> 09:25.240
Yeah, OK. Whatever.
Just go, please.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.408
All right.

09:51.472 --> 09:54.475
(train horn in the distance)

10:45.278 --> 10:47.279
Hello?

10:55.788 --> 10:57.914
Hello?

11:12.971 --> 11:16.017
- Hey!
- Oh, shit!

11:16.057 --> 11:18.101
Gypsies need a way out!

11:18.144 --> 11:20.104
You OK?

11:20.145 --> 11:22.481
Yeah. How's Peter?

11:22.522 --> 11:24.442
Uh, he, he's fine.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.360
- He's fine.
- Ah! Just like Peter.

11:26.402 --> 11:30.280
All right, well...

11:30.322 --> 11:33.116
funny thing is that compared
to most places

11:33.158 --> 11:35.744
in the world,
this place is hog heaven.

11:35.785 --> 11:39.206
Um, can you get
that chandelier?

11:39.248 --> 11:41.250
And that plate
with the shells on it?

11:41.292 --> 11:44.128
They took my money.

11:44.169 --> 11:46.380
Close call, huh?

11:46.422 --> 11:49.509
Yeah. Um...

11:49.548 --> 11:51.677
Destiny gave me a head's up.

11:51.719 --> 11:53.011
How would she know
anything about it?

11:53.053 --> 11:55.306
Oh, well, she, uh...

11:55.347 --> 11:57.975
she has her way.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.809
Where's the picture?

11:59.851 --> 12:01.769
Do you see a picture
of Nicolae?

12:01.812 --> 12:05.482
Here it is. Um...

12:05.524 --> 12:08.318
OK.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.321
Peter slept at the house.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.322
- You can just follow me up there.
- Uh, yeah, no, no.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.658
I don't, I don't think so.
I think, uh...

12:14.700 --> 12:17.495
the Rumanceks and the Godfreys

12:17.537 --> 12:21.206
are a little too close
for my comfort.

12:21.249 --> 12:23.042
What's that supposed to mean?

12:23.083 --> 12:27.671
(Lynda sniffs.)
Oh, whoa! Can anyone smell smoke here?

12:27.712 --> 12:29.756
If you want to help Peter,
keep him away

12:29.798 --> 12:33.052
from the animals that did this.

12:37.681 --> 12:39.682
(train horn in the distance)

12:44.522 --> 12:47.107
(cell phone ringing)

12:54.655 --> 12:57.201
- Yeah?
- [Yeah, it's me.]

12:57.243 --> 13:01.456
Your mom's OK...
but the trailer looks like

13:01.496 --> 13:04.125
the last time Shelley
took dancing lessons.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.625
Shit.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.878
How are you feeling?

13:07.919 --> 13:10.255
Actually, I'm fucking starving.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.969
All right.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.018
(Lynda): Hey, baby.
(meowing)

13:25.145 --> 13:28.274
- (Roman): Where you gonna go?
- I don't know.

13:28.316 --> 13:30.692
Oh! I hope
you're not allergic to cats.

13:30.734 --> 13:32.945
Peter loves that cat.

13:42.538 --> 13:44.999
Hey. Hey, come here, buddy.

13:45.039 --> 13:48.043
(Cat meows.)

13:48.085 --> 13:49.961
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

13:50.004 --> 13:53.006
Shh, shh, shh.

14:06.894 --> 14:09.148
Huh.

14:26.081 --> 14:28.167
Oh, yeah.

14:31.586 --> 14:33.922
(sniffing)

14:33.964 --> 14:35.633
Yeah.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.677
(sizzling)

15:18.174 --> 15:20.469
Ah! Ah...

15:28.727 --> 15:31.605
I came to check on Roman.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.538
(Peter sighs.)

15:48.581 --> 15:51.041
How is it possible
to miss someone so much

15:51.082 --> 15:54.669
after one day, huh?

15:54.711 --> 15:57.880
I think you're supposed
to be mad at me.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.592
Who says I'm not?

16:00.634 --> 16:03.845
Oh, so you're mad at me?

16:03.886 --> 16:06.640
Are boys always this stupid?
(Peter chuckles.)

16:09.058 --> 16:12.062
You're a jerk!

16:12.104 --> 16:14.440
Mm!

16:21.447 --> 16:23.740
Peter...

16:23.783 --> 16:25.743
the sheriff's daughters.

16:25.784 --> 16:29.330
I heard.

16:29.370 --> 16:31.499
My dad called this morning.

16:31.539 --> 16:35.210
He sounded really scared...

16:35.251 --> 16:38.547
like he just wanted
to know I was OK.

16:41.383 --> 16:43.344
OK.

16:43.384 --> 16:46.013
What do we do now?

16:48.515 --> 16:50.475
(Peter sighs.)

16:50.518 --> 16:53.894
I guess we just stand here like
this until something else happens.

16:58.359 --> 17:01.320
(Siren bleeps.)

17:01.361 --> 17:04.656
Come on, let's go.

17:13.164 --> 17:16.960
Son of a bitch!
They're inside.

17:20.548 --> 17:23.217
- [Which way?]
- Check the greenhouse.

17:23.258 --> 17:26.053
Yeah. Copy that.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.599
Peter, they think
you killed them?

17:31.642 --> 17:33.602
Cops don't think.

17:33.644 --> 17:35.936
Come on, front door.

17:41.276 --> 17:43.944
- (man): Hey!
- No, no, no, no. Come on.

17:48.576 --> 17:51.871
- Whoa! - No, no. Come on.
- Where are we going?

17:51.912 --> 17:53.913
To the woods. Whenever you're
in trouble, head for the woods.

17:53.954 --> 17:56.333
Stop fucking now!

17:56.375 --> 17:59.336
Motherfucker!

17:59.377 --> 18:03.298
Both of you, turn around,

18:03.339 --> 18:06.050
hands in the air.

18:06.093 --> 18:07.595
I won't say it again.

18:11.598 --> 18:13.099
That's that.

18:13.141 --> 18:15.644
The place looks empty.
You all right?

18:15.685 --> 18:19.021
Just dandy. Unlike
this piece of murdering shit.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.858
- Move aside.
- He didn't do anything.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.903
Bullshit, he didn't.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.865
Peter Rumancek,

18:27.906 --> 18:30.200
you have the right
to remain fucked.

18:30.241 --> 18:32.286
If you choose
to waive that right,

18:32.326 --> 18:34.371
further fucking will be provided
for you free of charge.

18:34.413 --> 18:37.124
- Don't!
- You shut up. You know,

18:37.164 --> 18:38.917
I should do you right here,
you little scum.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.044
I've known Tom Sworn's
girls all their lives.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.881
- I said leave him!
- Ah! Get off!

18:45.883 --> 18:49.385
You do that again, I'm gonna
break his goddamn neck.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.387
<i>Pula va cadea.</i>

18:51.430 --> 18:53.432
What the fuck was that?

18:53.473 --> 18:55.517
Oh, you'll get the joke
when your dick falls off.

18:55.558 --> 18:57.728
Ha! Ha! Ha! Funny boy, huh?
(The man punches Peter.)

18:57.769 --> 18:59.730
Uh...

18:59.771 --> 19:01.397
(Letha): Shelley.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.567
Oh, that's fucking perfect.

19:03.608 --> 19:05.986
Go! Get the hell out of here!

19:06.027 --> 19:10.198
Oh, brilliant!

19:10.240 --> 19:12.785
(whispering): It's OK, Shel.

19:12.826 --> 19:16.329
- Ho-ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
- Roman...

19:16.371 --> 19:19.625
you're awake?

19:19.666 --> 19:22.294
Stay back. What are you doing?

19:22.336 --> 19:25.506
You have a gun pointed at the back
of your head. Do not, repeat,

19:25.547 --> 19:27.547
- do not turn around!
- (Letha): Roman, be careful.

19:31.178 --> 19:35.182
- You think I won't?
- Put the gun in your mouth.

19:35.222 --> 19:39.102
(man): Come back here!
What the fuck are you doing?

19:41.313 --> 19:43.606
- Uncuff him.
- Screw you!

19:45.483 --> 19:47.944
If he's still handcuffed
by the time I count to three,

19:47.987 --> 19:49.654
pull the trigger.

19:49.696 --> 19:52.490
One.

19:52.532 --> 19:54.617
- Two!
- OK, OK!

19:54.660 --> 19:56.996
Just calm down, buddy.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.794
What the fuck, man?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.671
Come here.

20:18.307 --> 20:20.268
Get in your car

20:20.309 --> 20:22.813
and take the 79
to the West Virginia state line.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.105
When you get there...

20:25.147 --> 20:27.150
you can take the gun
out of your mouth,

20:27.192 --> 20:29.361
And you...

20:29.403 --> 20:32.113
will punch yourself
in the face hard enough

20:32.154 --> 20:34.074
to break your nose.

20:34.115 --> 20:36.701
Bye now.

20:36.743 --> 20:39.287
What the fuck?

20:50.214 --> 20:52.509
Roman.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.011
Roman, what did you do to them?

20:55.054 --> 20:58.766
I just suggested they
relocate. You're not safe here.

20:58.807 --> 21:01.018
No shit.

21:09.734 --> 21:11.193
Norman...

21:11.236 --> 21:14.949
I believe
we have a matter to discuss.

21:16.951 --> 21:20.119
It's not a good time, Liv.

21:20.161 --> 21:22.623
Of course it isn't.

21:22.663 --> 21:25.709
If you...
if you ask me to leave,

21:25.750 --> 21:27.669
- I will.
- No.

21:27.711 --> 21:30.547
No, I don't want you to leave.

21:30.588 --> 21:32.967
Can I get you something?

21:36.470 --> 21:38.430
I certainly didn't

21:38.471 --> 21:42.182
come all this way
so you could fetch me a coffee.

21:44.394 --> 21:47.064
Do you understand why I'm here?

21:47.105 --> 21:50.817
Your motives are never
far from the surface.

21:50.858 --> 21:53.361
You heard about
the sheriff's girls?

21:53.403 --> 21:55.238
Yes.

21:55.279 --> 21:57.198
A tragedy.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.660
And, judging from your mood,

21:59.701 --> 22:02.913
one for which
you inexplicably feel culpable.

22:02.954 --> 22:06.125
No. No, not culpable. Just...

22:08.460 --> 22:10.503
...useless.

22:10.545 --> 22:13.632
You know,
I went to see him, Tom.

22:13.673 --> 22:16.759
I mean not as a doctor,
as a friend, and even as that,

22:16.801 --> 22:19.512
I couldn't do a damn thing
to relieve his pain.

22:21.597 --> 22:24.351
I wonder...

22:24.392 --> 22:27.688
is that how my brother felt
that night outside the tower?

22:27.729 --> 22:30.523
- You're nothing like JR.
- No.

22:30.565 --> 22:32.608
Since he was,
for all his faults,

22:32.651 --> 22:35.236
a singularly decisive man.

22:37.780 --> 22:40.282
Perhaps a... a coffee

22:40.325 --> 22:43.327
would be in order after all.

22:43.369 --> 22:44.997
Six months.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.167
Oh...

22:49.208 --> 22:51.461
Because you understand

22:51.502 --> 22:53.462
that my wife's only crime

22:53.505 --> 22:56.383
was giving the best years
of her life to a man

22:56.423 --> 22:58.844
who fell out of love with her,

22:58.885 --> 23:01.096
which happened
the moment I first laid

23:01.137 --> 23:02.972
eyes on you.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.932
Yeah,

23:04.974 --> 23:08.061
six months should be enough
to acquit my obligations.

23:08.103 --> 23:11.355
Letha will have had her baby. There
will of course be an equitable

23:11.397 --> 23:13.817
financial arrangement
for all concerned and then...

23:15.818 --> 23:19.405
...I will leave Marie.

23:19.446 --> 23:22.201
I will become a grandfather. Ha!

23:24.869 --> 23:27.538
And I will marry you.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.792
My dear Norman.

23:31.835 --> 23:33.795
(knocking on door)

23:33.836 --> 23:35.797
Dr. Godfrey? I'm sorry but

23:35.838 --> 23:39.258
- it's time for your meeting.
- I'll be out in a moment.

23:41.259 --> 23:43.846
No, no, stay, stay.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

23:43.888 --> 23:47.058
If only I could.

23:47.101 --> 23:49.019
Go about your day, darling.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.269
Uh, there will be...

23:51.311 --> 23:53.981
there will be time
for the rest later.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.528
Wait!

23:59.570 --> 24:01.781
I mean it this time.

24:04.409 --> 24:06.787
What makes you think
I don't know that?

24:06.827 --> 24:09.163
(Norman sighs.)

24:13.542 --> 24:15.711
(cell phone ringing)

24:15.753 --> 24:17.923
Letha?

24:17.964 --> 24:20.008
- Letha: [Hi, Dad.]
- What's wrong?

24:20.049 --> 24:22.803
[Roman's awake.]

24:22.844 --> 24:25.180
(Peter): Where the hell
are we?

24:25.221 --> 24:27.473
(Letha): I used to take walks
back here with my dad.

24:27.515 --> 24:29.683
(Peter): This is all part
of Hemlock Acres?

24:48.287 --> 24:51.789
Well, it's a relief
to see you up and about, Roman.

24:51.832 --> 24:53.875
But you - or you -

24:53.916 --> 24:55.876
should have told me.
- I'm sorry, Dad,

24:55.919 --> 24:58.297
things have been
a little crazy.

24:58.336 --> 25:01.758
Glad to see you're
all right. Letha told me.

25:01.799 --> 25:04.135
What that mob did
to your home was a disgrace.

25:04.178 --> 25:06.596
Well, the place
needed a tune-up.

25:06.637 --> 25:08.556
(soft chuckle)

25:08.597 --> 25:11.392
Come on.

25:26.991 --> 25:28.993
(door closing)

25:32.497 --> 25:34.790
Yeah... we closed this

25:34.833 --> 25:37.085
when we opened the new sanctuary
three years ago.

25:37.126 --> 25:39.712
Didn't get a chance
to clean it up.

25:39.753 --> 25:42.507
Anyway, won't have
to worry about anyone

25:42.548 --> 25:44.509
checking the ashtrays.

25:44.550 --> 25:47.179
Ha.

25:47.221 --> 25:50.140
- What?
- Uh, you know,

25:50.182 --> 25:53.476
it's just been
a month of Sundays.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.904
We didn't know who else to ask.

26:04.945 --> 26:08.575
I know that this could cause
trouble for you.

26:08.615 --> 26:12.494
Well, making bad decisions is
one of the perks of ownership.

26:12.537 --> 26:15.749
The town has lost its mind.

26:15.789 --> 26:19.669
Peter should stay here
until this lunacy dies down.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.837
Thank you.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.007
You two try and find a hole

26:24.048 --> 26:26.009
that's not an inch deep in dust.

26:26.050 --> 26:28.095
And Roman?

26:30.096 --> 26:32.807
Give me a hand?

27:12.388 --> 27:14.348
All right.

27:14.391 --> 27:17.894
What the FUCK is going on?

27:17.935 --> 27:21.605
- It's just that sometimes--
- You do not get to hold back,

27:21.647 --> 27:25.483
not when my daughter
is involved!

27:25.526 --> 27:27.486
Sometimes a wolf goes crazy

27:27.528 --> 27:30.240
and doesn't eat what it kills.

27:32.784 --> 27:34.743
When you say wolf,

27:34.786 --> 27:37.830
- what exactly do you mean?
- I mean werewolf.

27:37.872 --> 27:40.040
You do realize you're talking
to a clinical psychiatrist,

27:40.083 --> 27:42.461
not some fucking witch doctor?

27:42.500 --> 27:44.337
Assume, just for a moment,

27:44.378 --> 27:48.048
that what I'm saying is true,
OK? Then what?

27:48.090 --> 27:51.760
- Is it Peter?
- No.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.762
Does Letha know
what you're doing?

27:53.805 --> 27:56.891
Sort of, but I, I don't think
she really believes it either.

27:58.893 --> 28:01.855
So you two have been trying
to what, find this -

28:01.895 --> 28:05.817
Ha! Ha! Ha! - bad werewolf?

28:05.858 --> 28:09.695
- Vargulf. - Excuse me?
- Vargulf, what they call it.

28:09.737 --> 28:13.450
And he's not bad really.
He's just sick.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.535
- But you didn't find him?
- Not yet.

28:16.576 --> 28:19.247
And that's because...?

28:19.288 --> 28:21.833
I was in a coma.

28:24.126 --> 28:26.545
Right.

28:26.586 --> 28:30.217
Supposing you
just sum up for me

28:30.258 --> 28:32.385
what you've actually
learned about this...

28:32.426 --> 28:36.347
- vargulf.
- There isn't much,

28:36.390 --> 28:38.224
but we have time...

28:38.266 --> 28:40.227
before the next full moon.

28:40.268 --> 28:43.063
In the meanwhile,
we keep that one away

28:43.104 --> 28:45.022
from the torches
and the pitchforks.

28:45.065 --> 28:47.317
Is that the idea?

28:54.574 --> 28:57.536
Is this you deciding whether you
should have us all committed?

28:57.576 --> 29:01.288
Actually I was just thinking that
fatherhood is fucking overrated,

29:01.330 --> 29:04.959
and that your friend is
gonna need some blankets.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.961
Oh, by the way,

29:07.002 --> 29:09.797
have you spoken
to your mother recently?

29:09.838 --> 29:12.299
Why?

29:12.342 --> 29:14.428
No reason.

29:17.846 --> 29:20.974
- Does your mom know you're OK?
- She doesn't give a shit.

29:59.472 --> 30:01.182
Sorry. I didn't know
you were here.

30:07.980 --> 30:10.275
Hello?
(fingers snapping)

30:10.317 --> 30:13.236
Anyone home?

30:18.115 --> 30:20.410
She's not safe.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.578
What?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.580
She and the baby aren't safe.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.208
You think that monster
doesn't want her too?

30:27.250 --> 30:31.045
I don't know
anything about that.

30:33.381 --> 30:36.009
Wait here. Hey!

30:36.049 --> 30:38.385
Hey, you better get some meds
over here!

30:48.355 --> 30:51.316
I want to stay here
tonight. With you.

30:51.357 --> 30:53.317
I don't think so.

30:53.359 --> 30:56.945
Your dad,
he gave me the, the look.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.948
What look?

30:58.990 --> 31:01.576
The look that says
you're not staying here tonight.

31:01.617 --> 31:04.287
Since when are you an expert
on my dad's catalogue

31:04.328 --> 31:06.747
of facial expressions, huh?

31:06.788 --> 31:09.041
I gotta be good at something.

31:13.337 --> 31:15.006
Hey!

31:17.008 --> 31:19.926
It's the ring you gave me.

31:22.430 --> 31:25.766
It's been in my purse.

31:25.807 --> 31:27.809
Thought you didn't like it.

31:27.852 --> 31:31.355
- No. I didn't like YOU then.
- Hmm...

31:38.238 --> 31:40.198
Hello.
(Letha chuckling.)

31:40.240 --> 31:42.366
Hey!

31:46.787 --> 31:49.039
They were in their beds, Peter.

31:51.291 --> 31:54.127
Whatever it was got in
without being seen

31:54.170 --> 31:56.297
to do that to them.

31:56.338 --> 31:58.424
It's no wild animal.

31:58.465 --> 32:01.260
What kind of person
has it in them...

32:03.262 --> 32:05.682
...to do that?

32:07.849 --> 32:10.810
I think
that we all have it in us...

32:12.813 --> 32:15.650
...but some worse than others.

32:19.945 --> 32:22.574
Still.

32:22.615 --> 32:24.617
The mystery of death
isn't a bad thing, hey?

32:26.577 --> 32:29.413
Without it we wouldn't
have this.

32:33.084 --> 32:36.086
(whispering): Come here.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.050
(whispering): I love you.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.345
(Letha laughs.)

32:51.059 --> 32:52.770
Whoa!

32:52.811 --> 32:54.814
In a church?

32:57.608 --> 32:59.736
(creaking)

32:59.778 --> 33:02.070
(door slamming shut)

33:02.113 --> 33:05.825
That look.

33:05.865 --> 33:08.577
Hospitals have
a lousy reputation for food,

33:08.619 --> 33:11.830
and this won't change anything.

33:11.872 --> 33:13.958
But it should keep you
going until morning.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.960
I'll be fine.

33:16.001 --> 33:18.587
I'm going home
to check on Shelley.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.048
We start over tomorrow, right?

33:21.089 --> 33:23.259
Mm-hmm.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.679
We should go.

33:34.103 --> 33:36.605
(Letha): I love you, you know.

33:46.031 --> 33:48.159
(Peter groans.)

33:52.163 --> 33:56.334
(door closing)
This ain't so bad.

33:56.375 --> 33:58.377
(Peter shouts, it echoes.)

34:03.007 --> 34:05.509
Casper?

34:05.551 --> 34:07.511
Casper!

34:07.554 --> 34:10.056
Hey, there you are.

34:10.096 --> 34:13.559
Hey, that's mine.
(Casper meows.)

34:29.242 --> 34:32.119
Dad?

34:32.161 --> 34:36.331
Are you all right?

34:36.373 --> 34:38.418
I know today's
been a lot for you.

34:40.420 --> 34:43.130
I'm really sorry.

34:43.172 --> 34:45.340
Actually I'm fine.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.637
I'm fine.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.518
Ah, there you are!
Oh, my baby!

34:55.559 --> 34:59.146
Sorry it's so late. I got
her back as soon as I could.

34:59.188 --> 35:01.440
There's a casserole
in the fridge if you're hungry.

35:03.443 --> 35:05.445
Ravenous!

35:10.074 --> 35:12.492
(thunder)

35:16.038 --> 35:18.123
(electronic voice):
<i>They were afraid of Peter.</i>

35:18.164 --> 35:20.208
- Who was?
<i>- Cook, maid.</i>

35:20.251 --> 35:23.503
<i>Everyone left.</i>

35:23.545 --> 35:25.840
I'll always be here for you.

35:25.882 --> 35:28.467
<i>Promise?</i>

35:28.509 --> 35:31.010
Super pinkie swear.

35:31.052 --> 35:33.012
(soft chuckle)

35:38.894 --> 35:42.606
<i>- Did you dream about me?</i>
- I did.

35:42.648 --> 35:44.650
The whole time I was out.

35:44.692 --> 35:46.902
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

35:46.945 --> 35:49.947
You were exactly
like you've always been...

35:50.030 --> 35:52.992
more beautiful
than this world deserves.

35:55.786 --> 35:58.164
Come here.

35:58.204 --> 36:00.206
What's wrong, Shel?

36:02.208 --> 36:04.878
What's wrong?

36:04.920 --> 36:08.757
<i>Wish I could see myself there.</i>

36:15.431 --> 36:17.766
Where's mom?

36:19.768 --> 36:22.896
<i>Don't know. I'm afraid.</i>
(thunder)

36:22.938 --> 36:26.775
It's OK.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.987
How about we clean this up, huh?

36:34.032 --> 36:36.369
(thunder)

36:38.538 --> 36:42.248
(thunderclap)
(worried meowing)

36:50.842 --> 36:52.885
Nurse!

36:52.927 --> 36:55.762
<i>Nurse!</i>

36:55.804 --> 36:57.891
Nurse! I came to check on her.
She's gone.

36:57.931 --> 37:00.976
Where the hell is she?
Where the hell is she?!

37:01.018 --> 37:03.353
Where the hell
is Christina Wendell?!

37:06.023 --> 37:07.983
Liver temp's conclusive.

37:08.025 --> 37:10.068
She was killed
sometime last night.

37:16.115 --> 37:19.786
I thought I ordered a redhead.

37:19.829 --> 37:21.539
There was another one.

37:21.581 --> 37:25.083
- Another what?
- Last night, another girl.

37:25.125 --> 37:26.920
Who?

37:26.960 --> 37:30.590
They don't know yet.
No head.

37:30.630 --> 37:33.592
It wasn't Letha. I checked
on her before I came here.

37:33.634 --> 37:35.594
But it was the wrong moon.

37:35.635 --> 37:38.179
That's supposed
to be impossible, right?

37:38.222 --> 37:41.349
Yeah, maybe... maybe not.

37:41.391 --> 37:44.061
What do you mean? I thought
we still had time to find him.

37:44.103 --> 37:46.021
You need to be with Letha
at sundown tonight.

37:46.063 --> 37:49.067
- Why?
- I mean it.

37:49.108 --> 37:51.860
She's on your watch until this
is over. This is your job now.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.987
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Destiny.

37:54.030 --> 37:56.197
She knows more about the, uh...

37:56.239 --> 37:58.909
- the protocols than I do.
- Protocols?

37:58.952 --> 38:02.204
Or whatever. She might have a better
idea about this, because I sure don't!

38:02.246 --> 38:04.623
If you go out
in public, you'll be shot!

38:04.664 --> 38:07.001
- That's if you're lucky!
- Yeah, well, I'm a lucky guy.

38:07.043 --> 38:08.878
This is no joke!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.630
OK?

38:12.923 --> 38:14.925
Here. Call her.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.264
This isn't a pizza delivery.

38:24.601 --> 38:27.186
(Peter sighs.)

38:27.228 --> 38:29.188
You go.

38:29.231 --> 38:31.650
OK.

38:36.655 --> 38:39.324
And Roman...

38:39.365 --> 38:43.663
I meant it... about Letha.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.626
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.559
(knocking on door)

39:13.317 --> 39:15.652
Hm...

39:17.697 --> 39:20.239
- How's my baby?
- He's safe where he is.

39:20.282 --> 39:23.827
No, he's not, but...

39:23.869 --> 39:26.371
what does he need?

39:26.413 --> 39:29.750
There was another murder
last night, the vargulf.

39:29.791 --> 39:33.963
I know, I know.

39:34.005 --> 39:37.132
Peter said
you were some kind of expert.

39:37.175 --> 39:40.219
So how is this happening?

39:40.260 --> 39:43.304
You really have no idea
what you are, do you?

39:43.347 --> 39:46.184
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

39:46.224 --> 39:49.228
OK.

39:49.268 --> 39:51.731
First...

39:51.771 --> 39:53.983
experts are the people
that you see on TV.

39:54.025 --> 39:56.985
And the laws of magic
are like the laws of anything,

39:57.027 --> 39:58.987
they work because you obey them.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.490
- Then you can just break them?
- Not the way you think.

40:02.532 --> 40:05.119
This vargulf can.
How do we fight that?

40:05.161 --> 40:07.413
You don't.

40:07.454 --> 40:10.083
I'm part of this.

40:10.123 --> 40:12.001
Killing him is something
I'm supposed to do.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.170
There are dreams so real
you can feel

40:14.211 --> 40:16.838
their teeth marks
when you wake up.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.592
And then
there's the smell of coffee.

40:19.632 --> 40:22.219
It's time for you to admit
that this isn't your fight.

40:25.556 --> 40:28.516
- People are still dying.
- That has nothing to do with it.

40:40.445 --> 40:42.447
So how does Peter fight him?

40:46.409 --> 40:48.494
The way wolves usually do.

40:48.536 --> 40:50.914
Then he can do the same thing?

40:50.956 --> 40:53.583
He can turn
when the moon is wrong?

40:53.626 --> 40:55.628
Not for free.

40:57.670 --> 40:59.297
Nothing is for free.

40:59.338 --> 41:02.050
Then what's the price?

41:04.052 --> 41:05.887
I don't know.

41:07.931 --> 41:10.184
Who does?

41:10.226 --> 41:12.436
The only person who can know
the answer is Peter.

41:12.478 --> 41:15.231
Not without some help he can't.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.565
I can give him what he needs,
but no matter what,

41:17.608 --> 41:20.318
it's gonna be a giant
crap sandwich for him to eat.

41:20.360 --> 41:23.655
Aren't there...

41:23.697 --> 41:25.657
protocols or something?

41:25.699 --> 41:27.867
Oh, Peter, Peter, Peter.

41:27.909 --> 41:30.079
You know, there was nothing
about this that 1,000 miles

41:30.121 --> 41:31.871
of interstate
couldn't have solved.

41:31.914 --> 41:33.666
Except when it doesn't.

41:33.706 --> 41:35.960
Fine.

41:36.001 --> 41:38.211
Don't act like we haven't
talked about this before.

41:38.253 --> 41:41.047
I said fine.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.762
What do you mean
you talked about it?

41:46.804 --> 41:49.347
- About Peter running away?
- Yep.

41:49.389 --> 41:52.101
That is not always
the best solution.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.769
(Lynda pouring a drink)
Why?

41:54.811 --> 41:57.106
Did Peter tell you
about Nicolae?

41:57.148 --> 42:00.818
He said he killed
one of his own.

42:00.860 --> 42:03.445
Yeah, well...

42:03.487 --> 42:05.447
the brother
of the man Nicolae killed

42:05.489 --> 42:07.449
found us many years later,

42:07.490 --> 42:09.702
meaning that Nicolae
had to become a murderer

42:09.742 --> 42:12.704
twice in his life. The fires
go out, the coals stay hot.

42:12.746 --> 42:14.947
If this isn't ended, this will
be just around the corner

42:14.956 --> 42:16.916
for the rest of Peter's life.

42:16.958 --> 42:18.918
(sigh)

42:18.960 --> 42:21.172
That story sounds
so much better in Romanian.

42:24.007 --> 42:26.510
I miss when Peter was a baby.

42:26.552 --> 42:29.804
If I could flip a switch, I'd
live in a whole world of babies.

42:33.809 --> 42:36.769
I'm gonna help him
through this.

42:44.610 --> 42:46.445
(Destiny sighing)

42:53.371 --> 42:55.164
Wait.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.666
Tell Peter I love him, OK?

42:58.708 --> 43:00.960
OK.

43:03.463 --> 43:05.423
Wait.

43:05.465 --> 43:07.467
What?

43:11.554 --> 43:14.682
You...<i>Sahastrara...</i>

43:14.724 --> 43:17.686
sometimes it glows.

43:19.688 --> 43:21.565
OK...

43:47.007 --> 43:50.260
How do you know your cousin's
not talking a lot of bullshit?

43:50.302 --> 43:52.262
She said I can't
be part of this.

43:52.304 --> 43:54.556
Trust me. If I could switch
places with you...

43:54.597 --> 43:56.557
I would.

43:56.599 --> 43:58.436
(purring)

44:00.438 --> 44:03.315
- What's that smell?
- It's beeswax.

44:03.356 --> 44:07.110
Is that important,
the kind of candle it is?

44:07.152 --> 44:10.739
Well, the way it was explained to me
is that it's the sum of all the parts.

44:10.780 --> 44:14.159
You can bake a cake
without sugar,

44:14.201 --> 44:16.869
but it won't taste as sweet.

44:22.541 --> 44:25.753
- Now?
- Yeah.

44:33.094 --> 44:35.639
(Peter whispers indistinctly.)

44:44.273 --> 44:46.858
What?

44:46.900 --> 44:50.527
- Take it.
- Your hand?

44:52.697 --> 44:54.699
(Casper meows.)

45:01.789 --> 45:04.501
(Peter speaking
a Romani language)

45:20.809 --> 45:22.728
OK...

45:22.768 --> 45:24.980
Are we in business?

45:38.576 --> 45:40.413
(Casper meows.)

45:40.454 --> 45:43.956
What are you
doing with the cat?

45:43.998 --> 45:47.503
I know. You trusted me.

45:47.545 --> 45:49.880
What are you doing?

45:49.922 --> 45:51.882
(purring)
You might want to turn around

45:51.923 --> 45:54.300
- for this.
- NO! What are you doing?!

45:54.342 --> 45:55.885
(Casper meows.)

45:55.927 --> 45:57.929
(Casper's neck snapping)

46:03.436 --> 46:05.438
It's over.

46:09.942 --> 46:11.902
I think I'm gonna go outside

46:11.943 --> 46:13.987
- for a minute.
- OK, that's OK.

46:24.831 --> 46:27.000
(sigh)

46:39.721 --> 46:41.722
(flesh tearing)

46:48.563 --> 46:52.233
(fleshy squishing sounds)

47:21.679 --> 47:23.681
Fucking cat.

47:51.251 --> 47:54.505
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

47:54.547 --> 47:56.255
Hey!

47:56.297 --> 47:58.342
If anybody sees you,
we're fucked!

48:15.233 --> 48:18.987
Don't tell me that.

48:19.028 --> 48:20.989
Don't...

48:21.030 --> 48:23.824
don't tell me that.

48:28.163 --> 48:30.164
Come, Nicolae.

48:33.751 --> 48:35.713
Help me, Nicolae!

48:35.753 --> 48:39.215
When I was a young man
such as yourself,

48:39.257 --> 48:41.927
our kind faced many dangers.

48:41.967 --> 48:44.929
I rode with an old woman,

48:44.971 --> 48:46.972
Magdalena.

48:48.934 --> 48:52.563
She could have been my grandmother
or great grandmother.

48:52.605 --> 48:56.190
<i>No one knew for sure.</i>
<i>We rode from place to place...</i>

48:56.233 --> 48:59.527
<i>never settling.</i>

48:59.570 --> 49:03.155
One day, we were
stopped by some men

49:03.197 --> 49:05.867
<i>who wanted us to go</i>
<i>with them. Some of us</i>

49:05.909 --> 49:07.702
ran and got away.

49:07.744 --> 49:11.414
I saw Magdalena was
not so lucky.

49:11.456 --> 49:14.333
Huh!

49:14.376 --> 49:17.128
I was a foolish little boy then.

49:17.170 --> 49:19.465
<i>I thought I could protect her.</i>

49:19.505 --> 49:23.050
The uniforms
were saying one thing...

49:26.262 --> 49:28.931
<i>...but the leader was upir.</i>

49:30.934 --> 49:34.271
Bring me the woman!

49:34.313 --> 49:38.483
Tear the little beast's
throat out!

49:41.320 --> 49:44.572
(kid moaning)
<i> I ran and ran.</i>

49:44.614 --> 49:48.367
<i>I promise you</i>
<i>I never looked back.</i>

49:48.409 --> 49:51.163
In the end...

49:51.204 --> 49:53.164
I survived

49:53.206 --> 49:56.543
while many others did not.

49:56.585 --> 49:58.711
We run.

50:01.965 --> 50:04.050
It's what we do.

50:11.474 --> 50:15.269
Fuck you, Nicolae.

50:41.755 --> 50:43.798
I need something else.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.759
OK.

50:47.760 --> 50:50.556
Bacon.

50:50.597 --> 50:54.226
The grease, actually. I need you
to get me bacon grease.

50:56.268 --> 50:58.480
Is that how
you're gonna fight him?

50:58.521 --> 51:00.690
Yeah.

51:04.862 --> 51:06.903
Is there a price?

51:12.786 --> 51:14.788
My face.

51:16.664 --> 51:19.208
The price for breaking the rules

51:19.251 --> 51:22.670
is my human face.

51:35.099 --> 51:39.061
Did the brother of that guy Nicolae
killed really come after him?

51:39.103 --> 51:41.063
Your mom said

51:41.106 --> 51:43.358
he had to kill him too.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.068
It's a story.

51:46.110 --> 51:48.070
I believe it sometimes. Why?

51:48.112 --> 51:50.114
It's not important.

51:55.661 --> 51:57.664
Bacon grease.

51:57.706 --> 51:59.875
I'm gonna need a lot of it.

51:59.916 --> 52:02.543
All right.

52:16.349 --> 52:18.309
I believe
that's enough cholesterol

52:18.351 --> 52:20.311
to see you comfortably

52:20.353 --> 52:22.021
into your dotage.

52:22.063 --> 52:24.315
I'm feeling peachy, Mom.
Thanks for asking.

52:24.356 --> 52:28.110
It's quite obvious
you've made a complete recovery.

52:30.112 --> 52:34.326
- Where have you been?
- I was at the institute.

52:34.367 --> 52:37.536
I had a bit of a spell...

52:37.579 --> 52:40.706
but Dr. Pryce tells me
it's nothing to worry about.

52:42.708 --> 52:45.170
I'm really quite fine now.

52:47.213 --> 52:51.217
It's gonna end tonight.
Tonight, we're gonna kill it.

52:51.259 --> 52:54.471
Of course you are.

52:54.512 --> 52:58.056
Mm! Do turn the fan on, darling.

52:58.099 --> 53:00.393
The house will...

53:00.434 --> 53:04.021
stink of pig to high heaven.

53:04.063 --> 53:07.358
Tell Shelley I'm sorry,
but I won't be home for dinner.

53:07.400 --> 53:10.570
Before you go...

53:10.612 --> 53:13.699
if you may spare a moment
with your mother.

53:17.619 --> 53:20.664
Please.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.583
All right.

53:42.226 --> 53:44.938
Is this some kind of joke?

53:44.980 --> 53:47.356
Open it.

54:13.884 --> 54:17.219
Precious boy,

54:17.262 --> 54:19.264
you were born with the caul.

54:22.893 --> 54:26.478
I've always known
you were different. Better.

54:34.737 --> 54:38.532
Sometimes when I look
at people...

54:41.286 --> 54:43.579
...I can make them do
whatever I say.

54:45.581 --> 54:48.543
I know.

54:48.585 --> 54:51.045
So much alike.

54:57.594 --> 55:00.012
Roman...

55:00.054 --> 55:02.514
what do you see?

55:02.556 --> 55:06.311
I see us.

55:06.351 --> 55:08.981
Now look closer.

55:13.318 --> 55:16.403
- What is this?
- I finally understand

55:16.445 --> 55:19.657
what you've been feeling
these last months.

55:19.699 --> 55:23.286
I tried to protect you like any
mother would protect their son.

55:23.327 --> 55:26.039
What is this?!

55:26.081 --> 55:29.375
What you must do
to continue your journey.

55:31.670 --> 55:34.088
This...

55:34.130 --> 55:36.132
is your kill.

56:09.958 --> 56:14.086
(Roman breathing loudly)

56:14.128 --> 56:16.297
Try not to lose it, darling.

56:16.338 --> 56:18.967
It goes back a rather long way.

56:24.806 --> 56:27.349
We don't need words.

57:09.516 --> 57:11.936
(Chasseur moans.)
