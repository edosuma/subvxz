Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.498
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.572 --> 00:08.063
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.141 --> 00:10.541
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.610 --> 00:13.170
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.246 --> 00:16.373
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.076
Miam i.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.779
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.516
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.590 --> 00:26.457
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.526 --> 00:29.359
an old friend who used
to inform on you to the F.B.I.--

00:29.429 --> 00:31.727
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.130
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.361
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.904
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

[ Michael Narrating]
Spies make great neighbors. They're polite...

00:55.822 --> 00:58.256
they keep the lawn trimmed,
and they never crank the music at night.

00:58.324 --> 01:02.226
They don 't stand out because
they don 't wanna be found.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.287
So ifyou're hunting for a covert operative
and allyou've got to go on...

01:05.364 --> 01:07.799
are the names of
a few dozen suspects...

01:07.867 --> 01:10.631
you're out ofluck unless
you know where to look.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.637

That's Bi I l J ohnson's house.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.639
[ Sam ]
Yep. That gets funnier every time.

01:14.707 --> 01:20.441
So, Mike, this is what, the 1 0th Bill
we've looked at? I need a break, man.

01:20.513 --> 01:23.311
- You made me buyyou a beer
afterBill number eight.
- Yeah?

01:23.383 --> 01:27.319
- So I'll buyyou another round ifyou do the honors.
- [ Sighs ] Okay, deal.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.756
Oh! Oh, come on!

01:33.827 --> 01:36.694
Okay, that's two rounds, Mike.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.323
[Michael Narrating]
The garbage someone leaves on the curb...

01:39.399 --> 01:42.266
can often tellyou more than
a face-to-face conversation.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.599
- Not a lot of junk mail.
- Well, that fits.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.105
I had a hard time tracking
this particular Bill down.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.607
Keeps himself out
ofthe system pretty good.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.667
And he buys a lot of prunes.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.678
[Michael Narrating]
Shredded documents in the trash...

01:53.746 --> 01:56.977
used to be a strong indicator
that someone had a secret.

01:57.050 --> 02:01.510
But nowadays, every.body and their mother
shreds bills to prevent identity theft.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.579

02:06.292 --> 02:09.021

Okay, the guy I ives with his mother?

02:09.095 --> 02:10.722
I rui ned my khakis for nothing?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.129
I think we've found Carla's sniper.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.997
[Michael Narrating]
Laundry.bluing is a synthetic dye...

02:16.069 --> 02:18.003
that dry. cleaners use
bythe thimble...

02:18.071 --> 02:21.063
and covert operatives
go through by the bottle.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.235
It blots out secrets and works
like a poor man's dye pack...

02:24.310 --> 02:26.835
staining anyone who digs
through your trash.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.542
Wow. The guy's pretty paranoid.
They m ust be usi ng him for something big.

02:30.617 --> 02:33.142
Figure out what,
I may get some leverage against Carla.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.586
I need to know everything
there is to know about this Bill.

03:23.436 --> 03:28.271

That hurts me.

You know, I always pat down guys
who just show up who used to be dead.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.205
Fine, fine.
Ifyou're gonna frisk me, frisk me.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.045
Though that sweep of my inner right thigh
was pretty half-assed.

03:38.117 --> 03:41.086
- What the hell areyou doing here?
- I missed working with you, man.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.122
- Since I, uh, retired--
- Stay there.

03:43.189 --> 03:46.716
I've been working freelance stuff.
I got more work than I can handle.

03:46.793 --> 03:50.160
I just got a gig here in Miami.
I thought maybe you might be interested.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.720
You want me for a job?

03:51.798 --> 03:56.633
Yes. I wanna payyou
a lot of money to kill a lady.

04:06.279 --> 04:09.077
Uh-huh.
Still a yogurt man, I see.

04:09.148 --> 04:11.241
Well, I guess some things
haven't changed.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.308
Some things have.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.913
Yeah. I heard you got burned.

04:16.990 --> 04:20.447
That's all, Larry? You just heard?
You sure about that?

04:20.526 --> 04:23.757
What? You think maybe
I had something to do with it?

04:23.830 --> 04:26.526
Whoa!
I knowyou're angry, Mike...

04:26.599 --> 04:28.533
butyou gotta know
whoyour friends are.

04:28.601 --> 04:33.129
It wasn't old Larwho usedyou up and
spityou out. It was the government.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.800
- It's a little more complicated than that.
- Oh, please. Come on.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.503
You went off the reservation, kid.

04:38.578 --> 04:41.547
Unauthorized kills, sellingsecrets.

04:41.614 --> 04:45.277
I read the Michael Westen dossier
that's floating around out there.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.319
You know what I thought?
Finally.

04:47.387 --> 04:51.289
Finally, he wakes up.
Finally, the kid gets it.

Theyput us out there.
They tell us the endjustifies the means.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.186
And sooner or later,
you bel ieve them.

04:57.263 --> 05:00.892
I 'm a weapon, baby.
I don't need some government aiming me.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.164

I put some cash in my pocket. So what?

Hey, I'm behind you on this, Michael,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.969

Don't pretend you're some kind
of Boy Scout, Michael. I know better.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.007
I don't know about this thing.
It's a slippery slope.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.517
Slippery slopes can be kind offun,
like waterslides.

05:19.585 --> 05:21.644
Just hear me out, okay?

05:24.057 --> 05:27.686
Jeannie Anderson.
She is our dead-ee.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.058
That's my term.
It's trademarked.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.929
- She looks dangerous.
- Hey, some people live, some people die, kid.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.936
Jeannie is a cancernurse.
She married one ofherrich patients.

He got better.
Then he got sick again.

05:40.206 --> 05:44.506
Now he's in a coma.
But she is gonna die first.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.704
So who doesn't want her
to have his money?

05:46.779 --> 05:50.112
I can't tell you that. All my deals
are anonymous. Everything is e-mail.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.845
- There's no mess that way.
- Yeah, except for the killing.

Is that it?

05:55.988 --> 05:59.389
Michael, I don't need help
killing someone.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.394
Ifl wanted this lady dead,
she would be dead.

06:02.462 --> 06:06.523
Now, the whole idea here is that
you will do this one solo.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.227
That way, you can reestablish
some kind oftrust with me.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.463
And ifeverything works out well...

06:11.537 --> 06:14.370
maybe we can work together again...

06:14.440 --> 06:16.374
make some money.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.774

you couldn't use a little cash...

06:22.148 --> 06:24.480

some pretty nasty assignments.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.295
When a badjob comes along
you have two choices...

06:37.363 --> 06:39.297
and neither is very. appealing.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.765
You can pass and watch
the op go down...

06:41.834 --> 06:44.462
oryou can take the job
and make sure the op gets blown.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.631
- Trust me.
- What doyou expect me to do?

11:49.709 --> 11:53.611
Nothing.
I will handle this foryou, okay?

11:53.679 --> 11:57.137
Now, you met Fiona just now, right?

11:57.216 --> 12:01.243
She is going to be an old friend
from out oftown.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.117
She will staywith you
for a couple of days.

12:03.189 --> 12:07.091
She'll keep an eye on you
and on Drew.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.855
You have to trust me.
It's gonna be all right.

- [Madeline ] Michael?

12:19.839 --> 12:22.933
I've got some leftovers.
I thought maybe-- Hi, honey.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.739
- Oh, my God, Michael. What happened toyou?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.838
- No, you're not fine.
- I'm fine. I just fell down at work, that's all.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.008
This, see?

12:32.084 --> 12:34.450
This is the thing I cannot deal with,
all right?

12:34.520 --> 12:39.389

Do you have any idea how hard it is...

12:39.458 --> 12:43.656
to have an honest exchange with you
when you're withholding like this?

12:43.729 --> 12:45.697
You're reading a book or something?

12:45.765 --> 12:50.202
I'm seeing a counselor, Michael, and he's
pretty sureyou're the onewho has the problems.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.932
Soyou're actually here twisting my arm
until I go to counseling. That's honest.

12:54.006 --> 12:57.100
Besides, we've tried counseling.
You quit, remember?

12:58.344 --> 13:00.278
Well, I wanna try again.

to facilitate a dialogue is in the home.

then I don't know what to say.

13:13.058 --> 13:15.458
Fine. I will be there.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.422
Great, then.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.489

13:23.402 --> 13:27.395
Yeah, I know. I'm late.
But I come bearing gifts.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.464
That's the militaryjacket
on our favorite Bill Johnson.

13:29.542 --> 13:33.979

in exchange for some Sam time.

Not all my buddies are guys.

13:36.081 --> 13:39.209
Your method's your business, Sam.

13:39.285 --> 13:42.550
So it looks like our buddy Bill
had a hell ofa career in the marines.

And the fact that...

13:45.825 --> 13:47.759

in this guy's hands--

13:47.827 --> 13:49.852
Probablywasn't a birthday present.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.863
Looks like he was
dishonorably discharged.

13:51.931 --> 13:55.059
Yeah, right. The guywas a model marine.
He was in for 20 years.

- Wanna go over there now and take a crack at it?

14:04.443 --> 14:08.937
- Tomorrow. Right now,
I gotta do a job... with Larry.
- Larry?

Oh, man. I hated that guy.

Okay, I hate him present tense.

He's a bad influence.
Don't tell me you're working with him.

14:19.489 --> 14:23.255
I'm not working with him.
I'm working against him.

14:23.326 --> 14:25.260
In that case, can I help?

14:25.328 --> 14:28.786
- [Fiona] You have a lovelyhome.
- That's theproblem, isn't it?

14:28.865 --> 14:32.858
I mean, all this--Whatever.
I just wanted Robert.

14:32.936 --> 14:35.928
He was the strongest patient I ever had.
That's what got me.

14:36.006 --> 14:40.306
And... then I had
to watch it come back.

14:42.712 --> 14:46.580
I just wanna be there
for him to the end.

14:46.650 --> 14:49.084
You will.

14:51.788 --> 14:55.224
- How much longer before Drew gets back?
- Um--

14:56.793 --> 14:58.886
Twenty minutes?

14:58.962 --> 15:02.830
He runs a restaurant that Robert bought him.
But he's not much of a worker.

15:02.899 --> 15:07.029
So he usually comes home early,
showers and then goes out with friends.

15:07.103 --> 15:09.162
Give me a heads-up ifyou hear him.

15:16.546 --> 15:19.947

- Yeah. Whose Saab is that out front?

and it gets back to Larry...

make a few calls. The hit can't go down here.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.314
You got what you wanted.
Leave it alone.

38:46.383 --> 38:49.352
She is alive.
That is beautiful, beautiful.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.945
You know, kid, that's really good work.
Really, really good.

38:52.022 --> 38:54.013
[ Laughing ]

38:58.729 --> 39:01.698
Time foryou to shuffle off
to Buffalo, Lar.

39:01.765 --> 39:04.563
- Shuffle offto Buffalo and never come back.
- Yeah, nice, nice.

39:04.635 --> 39:07.103
The cops'll be all after me, won't they?
I'd better get going.

39:07.171 --> 39:09.196
But I got just one thing to say.

39:09.273 --> 39:13.505
You knew that kid was dead anyway.
Why didn'tyou take the shot?

39:13.577 --> 39:16.137
I didn't have it.

39:16.213 --> 39:19.512
No. That's not it.

39:19.583 --> 39:25.078
Let's face it. You couldn't bring yourself
to shootyour old friend.

39:25.155 --> 39:27.749
Hey, kid.

39:27.825 --> 39:30.851
Some people live, some people die.

39:30.928 --> 39:32.862
Seeya around.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.667
And the last thing
I'm grateful for, Mom...

39:44.742 --> 39:47.575
is that you gave me
your great eyesight.

39:47.645 --> 39:51.672
- I can't tell you how many times
I've been working, and I just--
-Jesus, Michael.

39:51.749 --> 39:55.116
Vision?
Are you serious?

39:55.185 --> 39:57.346
What, you couldn't come up
with five real things?

39:57.421 --> 40:01.585
- I-I did, I did.
- He doesn't even think I ever
did five things for him.

40:01.659 --> 40:04.890
In his life!
I was a terrible mother.

40:04.962 --> 40:06.896
Nowonderyou ran away.

40:06.964 --> 40:10.422
- You ran away?
- No, I didn't. I joined the militarywhen I was 1 7.

40:10.501 --> 40:13.299
Mydadsigneda form.
He couldn't wait to get me out ofthe house.

40:13.370 --> 40:18.398
I signed the form.
I forged his name.

40:18.475 --> 40:21.035
He would never let you go
into the military, Michael.

40:21.111 --> 40:23.136
Why didn't you tell me?

40:23.213 --> 40:26.910
Because I didn't wanna take away the one
thing thatyou were grateful toyour father for.

40:26.984 --> 40:29.714
I would have ifI'd known
my list was so short.

40:29.787 --> 40:32.722
You forged Dad's name?
Why?

40:32.790 --> 40:36.487
Because I knew ifyou didn't leave,
you'd end up in jail.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.256
Orworse.

40:40.764 --> 40:43.824
There's always been
a part ofyou, Michael--

40:43.901 --> 40:47.632
Maybe it's from your father,
I don't know.

40:47.705 --> 40:51.801
You could have turned out different.
I let you go...

40:51.875 --> 40:55.106
because you needed
to focus on something good.

40:57.247 --> 41:00.876
This is what I've been talking about.
You've crossed the bridge--

41:00.951 --> 41:03.818
- Oh, get out of my house!
- Get out of the house.

41:06.357 --> 41:08.587
Mom.

41:08.659 --> 41:11.093
Thankyou.

41:29.246 --> 41:31.840
1 500.
This has gotta be the place.

41:48.932 --> 41:52.129
[Sam ] Wow. He looks grumpier thanyou do
whenyou're going to meet with Carla.

41:52.202 --> 41:54.830
- Well, she hasn't had me kill anyone yet.
- Mmm.

41:54.905 --> 41:59.069
[Michael Narrating] Black bag missions
are often broken into separate parts.

41:59.143 --> 42:02.169
Operatives are given discreet tasks
to ensure secrecy.

42:02.246 --> 42:05.682
- Sam, the badge.
- They're like jigsaw pieces...

42:05.749 --> 42:08.980
andyou never know ifany ofthe ones
you're given are from the same puzzle.

42:09.053 --> 42:11.749
But ifyou can getyour hands
on a corner piece...

42:11.822 --> 42:14.757
the part where the puzzle
starts to take shape...

42:14.825 --> 42:17.726
sometimes you realize
allyour pieces fit together.

42:17.795 --> 42:20.559
I t's the same one
Carla had me forge.

42:20.631 --> 42:23.395
[ Sam ]
Damn, Mike. The badge, the rifle--

42:23.467 --> 42:26.800
Carla's turnedyou into
this sniper's personal shopper.

42:26.870 --> 42:31.705
I f everythi ng I 've done has been
tactical support for one big op...

42:31.775 --> 42:34.403
I think I know how
to find out what she's planning.
