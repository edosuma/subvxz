00:35.869 --> 00:37.328
ROMANOFF: This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.497
ROGERS: Maybe where it started.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.582
ROMANOFF: Hmm.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.333
And there's Stark's father.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.418
ROGERS: Howard.

00:45.837 --> 00:46.880
Who's the girl?

00:53.511 --> 00:57.849
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter. I supervise
all operations for this division.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.809
SOLDIER: What's with the accent,
Queen Victoria?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.979
Thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.232
-What's your name, soldier?
-Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.317
CARTER: Step forward, Hodge.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.818
HODGE: Mm. We gonna wrassle?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.737
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

01:13.531 --> 01:18.244
Our goal is to create the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.246
-Faster, ladies! Come on.
-(GRUNTS)

01:20.330 --> 01:22.207
You win wars with guts.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.125
-Grenade!
-(SOLDIERS WHIMPER)

01:25.293 --> 01:26.336
ROGERS: Get away!

01:29.172 --> 01:30.590
SOLDIER: It was a dummy grenade.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.221
BOY: Hey, Ronnie. Get the ball!

01:36.304 --> 01:38.139
ROGERS: I don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

01:38.223 --> 01:39.682
if you were a beautiful dame.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.267
Or a... A woman.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.727
An agent. Not a dame.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.020
You are beautiful, but...

01:45.605 --> 01:47.732
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

01:48.358 --> 01:50.235
This is the longest conversation I've had.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.489
Women aren't lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.825
You must have danced.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.661
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.080
And the past few years, it just

02:02.872 --> 02:05.208
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.335
For what?

02:08.837 --> 02:09.838
The right partner.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.593
STARK: We may dim
half the lights in Brooklyn,

02:16.553 --> 02:17.554
but we are ready.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.722
ERSKINE: Five,

02:20.515 --> 02:21.516
four...

02:23.518 --> 02:24.519
...three,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.272
-two...
-(BREATHING HEAVILY)

02:28.022 --> 02:29.023
...one.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.279
ERSKINE: Now, Mr. Stark.

02:46.749 --> 02:47.750
PEGGY: How do you feel?

02:47.834 --> 02:48.835
(PANTING) Taller.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.837
Oh.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.463
Um...

02:52.547 --> 02:53.756
You look taller.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.052
MAN: Oh, no.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.391
-As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
-CARTER: Colonel?

03:03.474 --> 03:06.436
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.356
The Hydra camp is tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.858
It's a factory of some kind.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.658
-Let's hear it for Captain America!
-(SOLDIERS CHEERING)

03:20.742 --> 03:22.660
CARTER: <i>Howard has</i>
<i>equipment for you to try.</i>

03:22.744 --> 03:23.745
What do you think?

03:23.828 --> 03:26.706
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.172
Yes, I think it works.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.175
We barely got out alive,
and you want us to go back?

03:37.258 --> 03:39.219
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.637
You don't like music?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.180
I do, actually.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.892
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.518
(CHUCKLES) What are we waiting for?

03:47.602 --> 03:48.895
The right partner.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.192
PHILLIPS: Hydra's last base is here,
in the Alps.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.613
SOLDIER: Watch your back! Move it!

04:00.615 --> 04:01.616
ROGERS: <i>You're late.</i>

04:02.408 --> 04:04.077
-Weren't you about to...
-Right.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.667
Get in!

04:11.626 --> 04:12.627
CARTER: Wait!

04:16.965 --> 04:18.383
Go get him.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.551
I'm not kissing you!

04:32.230 --> 04:35.817
ROGERS: There's not gonna be a safe
landing. But I can try and force it down.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.777
I'll get Howard, he'll know what to do.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.070
ROGERS: <i>There's not enough time.</i>

04:39.153 --> 04:41.322
<i>It's moving too fast</i>
<i>and heading for New York.</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:46.035
I'm gonna need a rain check on that dance.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.123
(SOBBING) All right.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.545
A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.214
You got it.

05:00.258 --> 05:04.178
CARTER: <i>8:00 on the dot.</i>
<i>Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

05:06.764 --> 05:08.599
You know, I still don't know how to dance.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.854
I'll show you how. Just be there.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.151
ROGERS: <i>Peggy?</i>

05:20.445 --> 05:21.654
CARTER: Steve?

05:22.989 --> 05:23.990
Steve?

05:27.201 --> 05:28.828
PHILLIPS: <i>We have a locked position</i>
<i>on Zodiac.</i>

05:32.707 --> 05:33.708
(YELLING) Help!

05:40.131 --> 05:42.050
STARK: <i>I have orders for Agent Carter.</i>

05:42.717 --> 05:47.180
If this is about last night, rest assured
she will be properly disciplined.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.558
Tell her she'll be running
S.H.I.E.L.D. with me.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.692
FURY: <i>You've been asleep, Cap.</i>

06:00.651 --> 06:02.111
<i>For almost 70 years.</i>

06:03.654 --> 06:05.782
<i>-You gonna be okay?</i>
-ROGERS: <i>Yeah, I just...</i>

06:07.742 --> 06:09.202
I had a date.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.914
SHARON: <i>Margaret Carter was known</i>
<i>to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:18.086
<i>I asked her once how she managed</i>
<i>to master diplomacy and espionage</i>

06:18.169 --> 06:21.255
<i>in a time when no one wanted to see</i>
<i>a woman succeed at either.</i>

06:21.339 --> 06:24.926
<i>She said, compromise where you can.</i>
<i>Where you can't, don't.</i>

06:25.009 --> 06:26.302
ROGERS: <i>Be proud of yourself, Peggy.</i>

06:26.886 --> 06:28.596
CARTER: <i>Well, I have lived a life.</i>

06:28.679 --> 06:31.891
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.894
You were meant for more than this.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.146
You told me I was meant
for more than this.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.607
-Did you mean that?
-Every word.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.360
CARTER: <i>The world has changed</i>

06:43.694 --> 06:45.822
<i>and none of us can go back.</i>

06:45.905 --> 06:46.989
Gonna miss you, buddy.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.285
ROGERS: <i>I couldn't leave my best girl.</i>

06:51.369 --> 06:53.079
Not when she owes me a dance.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.372
You ready, Cap?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.041
You bet.
