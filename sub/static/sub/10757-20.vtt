WEBVTT

00:10.292 --> 00:13.762
Dear God. It's a minefield out there.

00:14.087 --> 00:17.602
Everyone's talking about
a mini-series I've been watching.

00:17.925 --> 00:20.041
Did you see the end last night when...

00:20.302 --> 00:23.977
I attended a benefit last night. I had
to tape it and I have yet to see it.

00:24.306 --> 00:27.696
Who would've thought it?
Mr PBS watching a trashy mini-series.

00:28.018 --> 00:32.011
It's not trashy. The intricacies
of the plot are downright Dickensian.

00:32.356 --> 00:34.745
Yeah, Angie Dickensian.

00:35.025 --> 00:39.541
I'm having a difficult time avoiding
people telling me about the ending.

00:39.905 --> 00:42.419
Hi, Roz, did you watch last night?

00:42.699 --> 00:45.293
- Wasn't it...
- Goodbye, Betty.

00:49.081 --> 00:51.072
Hey, Dr Crane. How was your day?

00:51.333 --> 00:53.972
Interminable. Is the tape in the VCR?

00:54.253 --> 00:55.447
Yes, it's all cued up.

00:56.255 --> 01:00.043
You've got to call me when
you get to the part with Heather's baby.

01:01.718 --> 01:03.674
- Heather had a baby?
- Sorry.

01:03.929 --> 01:05.999
Who's the father? No, don't tell me.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.460
I'll put your popcorn in the microwave.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.985 --> 01:20.897
- Hey, Fras.
- Hi, Dad.

01:22.447 --> 01:27.157
I got some bad news. There isn't a good
way to tell you something like this.

01:31.248 --> 01:33.239
Your god-uncle died.

01:34.042 --> 01:36.602
My god-uncle?

01:38.380 --> 01:40.336
There's no such thing.

01:40.591 --> 01:45.301
It's your godfather's brother.
You remember your god-uncle Charlie.

01:45.679 --> 01:50.230
No. I barely even remember my godfather.
He died 20 years ago.

01:50.601 --> 01:53.911
Now his brother's dead, too.
The wake's in 20 minutes.

01:54.229 --> 01:58.017
Much as I'd like to pay my respects,
catch up with my god-cousins,

01:58.358 --> 02:00.349
and meet the god-neighbours,

02:00.611 --> 02:03.444
I have some urgent business
that can't wait.

02:03.739 --> 02:07.891
Here's your popcorn and the remote.
There, enjoy your show.

02:12.956 --> 02:15.516
All right.
I don't even know why I'm going.

02:15.792 --> 02:18.750
The man used to hide
his glass eye in my marble bag.

02:19.046 --> 02:21.037
I knew you remembered him.

02:21.298 --> 02:23.892
Just give me a couple of minutes
to get changed.

02:26.929 --> 02:28.920
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.

02:29.181 --> 02:32.969
You'd be smart to leave. Dad's dragging
me to a wake for god-uncle Charlie.

02:33.310 --> 02:35.949
The one who'd plop his eyeball
into his potatoes

02:36.230 --> 02:38.698
- and say, "I'm watching what I eat"?
- Yes.

02:40.901 --> 02:43.495
- So, is Daphne here?
- Yes, she is. Why?

02:43.779 --> 02:47.089
I'm asking her out on a date.
And don't give me that look.

02:47.407 --> 02:49.841
Why shouldn't I?
She's single. I'm single.

02:50.118 --> 02:51.471
Are you ready?

02:51.703 --> 02:54.615
I'm not talking about eloping.
It's just dinner.

02:54.915 --> 02:58.464
I suppose you've thought this through.
Maybe it is time.

02:58.794 --> 03:03.629
- Time for what?
- To put this popcorn away for later.

03:04.007 --> 03:08.319
- Aren't you watching your programme?
- He has to take Dad to a wake.

03:08.679 --> 03:10.670
Listen, Daphne, do you have a minute?

03:10.931 --> 03:15.846
Something I wanted to ask you.
Nothing earth-shattering. It's just...

03:16.228 --> 03:17.980
Yes?

03:19.856 --> 03:22.086
What's that perfume you're wearing?

03:22.359 --> 03:24.873
Leave it to you to notice.
It's Obsession.

03:25.153 --> 03:27.144
No, it isn't. I was just curious.

03:29.324 --> 03:32.202
No, I'm quite sure
it's Calvin Klein's Obsession.

03:32.494 --> 03:33.813
It's very pleasing.

03:34.037 --> 03:36.551
I spray it on my brush
and comb it through.

03:36.832 --> 03:39.869
Silly, really.
As if anyone's going to smell my hair.

03:43.881 --> 03:46.349
- What did she say?
- I couldn't do it.

03:46.633 --> 03:51.024
I was about to ask, then all I could
think of was what if she said no.

03:51.388 --> 03:56.064
It's no surprise. After all
you've been through with Maris,

03:56.435 --> 03:58.744
you are just scared
of another rejection.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.455
I was more than scared, I was terrified.

04:01.732 --> 04:04.292
I can't go on
worshipping Daphne from afar.

04:04.568 --> 04:07.002
It's frustrating
to be in love with someone

04:07.279 --> 04:09.713
and not be able to tell her
how you feel.

04:12.159 --> 04:16.391
I'm sorry. I just came back for
the fabric softener. I didn't mean...

04:16.747 --> 04:19.420
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

04:19.708 --> 04:22.700
- How long was she there?
- I don't know. If I'd known,

04:23.003 --> 04:26.916
I would've said,
"Shut up. Daphne's standing there".

04:27.257 --> 04:29.452
She heard everything.

04:29.718 --> 04:33.552
Calm down. It may even be for the best.
You wanted to take the next step.

04:33.889 --> 04:37.359
The next step. I was just hurled
down the entire flight of stairs.

04:37.684 --> 04:39.675
I can't believe this.

04:39.937 --> 04:43.930
Did Daphne really hear me say
that I'm in love...

04:45.108 --> 04:48.100
I'm sorry.
I really do need that fabric softener.

04:55.035 --> 04:59.028
You've got to talk to her.
It'll only become awkward.

04:59.373 --> 05:02.331
You can't leave things like this.
Resolve it now.

05:02.626 --> 05:04.617
Go.

05:05.379 --> 05:08.576
- Daphne...
- Dr Crane, I didn't...

05:08.882 --> 05:12.272
- I hope you don't think...
- No, I... Go ahead.

05:12.594 --> 05:16.143
I'm terribly sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to hear that.

05:16.473 --> 05:20.705
No, I'm glad you heard. It's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

05:21.061 --> 05:25.498
What took you so long?
I think it's wonderful.

05:25.857 --> 05:29.293
- You do?
- Yes, of course I do.

05:29.611 --> 05:32.125
You dear, sweet man, give me a hug.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.497
So, who is she?

05:48.005 --> 05:51.315
- Who?
- This woman you're so in love with.

05:51.633 --> 05:54.591
You didn't hear that part, did you?

05:54.887 --> 05:58.641
No. So, come on, what's her name?
You can't back out now.

05:58.974 --> 06:01.169
No, you're right. I can't.

06:01.435 --> 06:03.107
OK, her name...

06:03.353 --> 06:07.505
...just happens to be...
Da-Phyllis.

06:10.152 --> 06:14.270
I've never heard that name. Da-Phyllis.

06:16.158 --> 06:19.753
It's a family name.
Her friends call her Phyllis.

06:22.915 --> 06:26.874
Excuse me. I'll get some water.

06:27.211 --> 06:28.769
Where's Niles?

06:29.004 --> 06:32.314
He's in the kitchen.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like that.

06:32.633 --> 06:35.352
Did you and Niles have a little chat?

06:35.636 --> 06:39.345
Yes. He was a bit shy at first
but then he came clean.

06:39.681 --> 06:42.149
- I couldn't be happier.
- That is wonderful.

06:42.434 --> 06:44.584
Let me be the first
to raise a glass to...

06:48.190 --> 06:50.181
...to god-uncle Charlie.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.672
As long as you're doing the laundry,
the kitchen towels could use a washing.

06:56.031 --> 06:59.228
And my oven mitts
are getting a bit crunchy.

06:59.535 --> 07:01.253
What the hell is going on?

07:01.495 --> 07:05.090
All she heard was that I was in love
with someone and when she asked who,

07:05.415 --> 07:07.406
I blurted out Phyllis.

07:07.668 --> 07:09.340
Phyllis?

07:09.586 --> 07:11.577
It's a neighbour I saw this morning.

07:11.838 --> 07:14.432
She had a sesame seed
stuck between her teeth.

07:14.716 --> 07:17.150
It was the size of a blanched almond.

07:18.262 --> 07:21.220
Maybe it was a blanched almond.
If she had Mueslix...

07:21.515 --> 07:23.585
Niles, stop.

07:23.850 --> 07:26.728
You have got to clear this up.

07:27.020 --> 07:30.933
Well, I'm off to bring the car around
for Dad.

07:34.027 --> 07:37.417
All right now,
tell me more about this Phyllis.

07:37.739 --> 07:39.331
I'd rather not.

07:39.575 --> 07:43.284
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Have you asked her out yet?

07:43.620 --> 07:44.609
No.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.105
Why not?
You said you were in love with her.

07:47.374 --> 07:49.365
- In love with who?
- Phyllis.

07:49.626 --> 07:51.821
- Who's Phyllis?
- A woman I met.

07:52.087 --> 07:54.806
I've just been giving him
some dating advice.

07:55.090 --> 07:59.208
All you need to know
is that women go crazy for flattery.

07:59.553 --> 08:02.863
Doesn't matter if it's a big fat lie.
They'll still buy it.

08:03.181 --> 08:08.301
Whatever advice Daphne's giving you,
must be great because she's smart.

08:08.687 --> 08:10.678
Thank you, Mr Crane.

08:13.358 --> 08:16.714
So, tell me about this dream woman
of yours.

08:17.029 --> 08:21.819
- I don't know.
- I can see you're crazy about her.

08:24.828 --> 08:26.546
Well, all right.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.589
She's very beautiful. And very sweet.

08:32.376 --> 08:35.335
And she has a smile
that makes my knees weaken.

08:38.842 --> 08:42.881
Dr Crane, if this woman is as wonderful
as you say she is,

08:43.222 --> 08:47.340
then you shouldn't waste another moment.
She won't be on the market forever.

08:47.684 --> 08:50.403
You're right.
I've been a fool to hesitate.

08:50.687 --> 08:52.917
- That's the spirit.
- I'm going to do it.

08:53.190 --> 08:57.900
Don't leave time for second thoughts.
Ask her out this instant.

08:58.278 --> 09:01.395
- That won't be necessary.
- It's quite nasty out.

09:02.157 --> 09:06.708
No, I don't have to leave this room
to ask Phyllis on a date.

09:07.079 --> 09:10.754
- You don't?
- No. Because, you see, Daphne...

09:13.085 --> 09:15.235
I know her work number by heart.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.327
Well, then.

09:21.718 --> 09:24.516
- Look at me. My heart's racing.
- Mine, too.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.614
Phyllis, hello. Niles Crane.

09:30.894 --> 09:33.362
How are you?

09:33.647 --> 09:37.196
I was wondering if you would want
to have dinner with me sometime.

09:37.526 --> 09:41.485
<i>You would?
How about tonight at my place?</i>

09:42.823 --> 09:44.814
<i>Eight o'clock sounds great.</i>

09:49.329 --> 09:52.048
What would you do if you were me?

09:52.332 --> 09:56.530
Would you tell her everything and just
let the chips fall where they may or...

09:57.296 --> 10:00.094
Yeah. Well, I do see your point.

10:01.592 --> 10:05.949
I have to run. I'll take the three-year
subscription and travel clock.

10:15.898 --> 10:18.492
- Daphne.
- Hello. I was out doing some shopping

10:18.775 --> 10:22.609
and I thought you might need some
dessert for your dinner with Phyllis.

10:22.946 --> 10:26.416
Well, I was just doing some
last-minute tidying up for that.

10:26.742 --> 10:29.700
And I suppose you've got
about eight things cooking.

10:29.995 --> 10:33.226
So I'll get out of your way.
Soon as I pop this in the fridge.

10:33.540 --> 10:36.008
Don't trouble yourself.
I'll do it.

10:39.129 --> 10:42.963
Dr Crane, there's barely enough pasta
here for one person.

10:43.300 --> 10:47.293
Is this your idea of a romantic dinner?

10:47.638 --> 10:49.993
Thank heavens I stopped by.

10:50.891 --> 10:55.282
I can whip up a salad. I'll stick
this roast in the microwave to defrost.

10:55.646 --> 10:59.844
- Where's your cooking sherry?
- I am under-prepared for this.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.183
I'll call Phyllis and put her off.

11:02.444 --> 11:06.722
You're not backing out of this now.
Look, don't worry.

11:07.074 --> 11:10.191
I'll fix this place right up
for a nice, intimate evening.

11:10.494 --> 11:15.648
Candles, some soft music. Those things
always put me in a romantic mood.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.571
I suppose it would be rude to cancel.

11:19.836 --> 11:21.906
Now hurry up and get ready.

11:22.172 --> 11:26.006
And wear that blue blazer of yours.
No woman can resist you in that.

11:26.426 --> 11:28.781
Look at the time. Honestly, Dr Crane,

11:29.054 --> 11:33.047
sometimes I wonder what kind of
a fantasy world you live in. Now go on.

12:00.752 --> 12:03.505
- Don't you look handsome.
- Thank you.

12:03.797 --> 12:06.027
Daphne, this place looks wonderful.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.291
Excellent music. I love this aria.

12:08.552 --> 12:12.909
Yes, she has a gorgeous voice.
Pity she never got the recognition

12:13.265 --> 12:15.779
of a Joan Sutherland
or a Renata Tebaldi.

12:16.059 --> 12:18.619
I had no idea
you knew so much about sopranos.

12:18.896 --> 12:24.129
You don't live with your brother and
not learn a thing or two about divas.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.801
The roast is coming along nicely.

12:27.070 --> 12:30.062
- How are you at chopping vegetables?
- Are you kidding?

12:30.365 --> 12:34.563
You don't get forearms like these
from just conducting your stereo.

12:34.912 --> 12:38.029
I'm very excited for you.
I just love first dates.

12:38.332 --> 12:41.688
I don't see why.
They're always so awkward.

12:42.002 --> 12:45.472
Yeah, but once in a while,
when the chemistry's just right,

12:45.797 --> 12:50.393
they can be magical. The "me toos"
as you realise all you have in common,

12:50.761 --> 12:53.798
the electricity
of that first accidental touch,

12:54.097 --> 12:57.373
soon you're saying the silliest things.

12:57.684 --> 12:58.958
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

12:59.186 --> 13:02.098
You touched me,
now we have to get married.

13:04.691 --> 13:06.682
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

13:06.944 --> 13:10.698
Now I was thinking for the salad
some cucumbers and carrots.

13:11.031 --> 13:13.670
- How about some celery?
- No celery. I hate it.

13:13.951 --> 13:16.545
Me, too. Why do you have it then?

13:16.828 --> 13:21.026
Habit. Maris used to like to have it
around in case she felt like bingeing.

13:24.461 --> 13:28.773
When I was little, I actually thought
celery was the meanest vegetable.

13:29.132 --> 13:33.250
Radishes were the smartest,
beets were the policemen.

13:35.222 --> 13:37.690
What sort of personality
do carrots have?

13:37.975 --> 13:41.285
I try not to think about that
when I'm chopping them.

13:49.027 --> 13:51.302
You hear that? We're chopping in rhythm.

13:51.572 --> 13:53.563
We are, aren't we?

14:21.018 --> 14:23.009
Damn, who could that be?

14:23.270 --> 14:24.259
It's Phyllis.

14:28.317 --> 14:30.592
Well, go on. Go let her in.

14:33.197 --> 14:39.067
<i>Go away, who's ever at the door,
go away, don't come back no more.</i>

14:39.494 --> 14:41.485
I thought you were at a wake.

14:41.747 --> 14:45.820
We left. Even the mourners
were babbling about the mini-series.

14:46.168 --> 14:48.921
I'm sure you're in a rush
to watch the rest of it.

14:49.213 --> 14:51.522
No, everybody's
going to the Kiwanis Club

14:51.798 --> 14:54.153
for a post-wake kegger.
Could you take Dad?

14:54.426 --> 14:57.020
Me? Well, they're your god-family.

14:57.304 --> 15:01.013
- I thought you were Phyllis.
- Phyllis?

15:01.350 --> 15:07.141
She's due any moment. I'll be leaving
as soon as the roast is done.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.444
Daphne... is cooking dinner...

15:13.445 --> 15:16.164
for your date with a fictitious woman.

15:17.658 --> 15:20.968
Why not just set a place
for the March Hare and the Mad Hatter?

15:21.286 --> 15:24.323
I didn't plan for this,
but we are having a perfect evening.

15:24.623 --> 15:28.616
I need a few more minutes alone
and I'll be able to tell her everything.

15:28.961 --> 15:32.112
Niles, this absurd lie is likely
to blow up in your face.

15:32.422 --> 15:34.811
As long as I keep track
of what I'm saying,

15:35.092 --> 15:37.447
nothing is going to blow up on anyone.

15:38.554 --> 15:40.590
Phyllis!

15:40.847 --> 15:42.485
Ka-boom.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.557
Some of your mail
wound up in my box today.

15:45.852 --> 15:48.366
- Aren't you considerate?
- Hello.

15:48.647 --> 15:52.242
- I'm Frasier, Niles' brother.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

15:52.568 --> 15:57.403
- As a matter of fact...
- Hello. You must be Phyllis.

15:57.781 --> 15:59.851
Yes. Do I know you?

16:00.117 --> 16:03.154
I'm Daphne. I'm just a friend.

16:04.913 --> 16:08.303
Make yourself comfortable.
We were starting to worry.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.662
- Excuse me?
- Can I get you a glass of wine?

16:11.962 --> 16:15.841
- All right. I came by to drop off...
- I'll be back in a snap.

16:16.174 --> 16:19.052
That woman seemed to think
that you were expecting me.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.653
I've been getting to know my neighbours

16:21.930 --> 16:24.319
and I guess
you didn't get the invitation.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.830
No. It's dumb luck I stopped by tonight.

16:27.102 --> 16:29.775
Here we are. Now the appetisers
are almost ready

16:30.063 --> 16:34.136
and it won't be much longer until
the roast is done. I hope you're hungry.

16:34.484 --> 16:38.796
- The invitation was for dinner?
- Yes, but we'll do it another time.

16:39.156 --> 16:40.635
I'd love to stay.

16:43.493 --> 16:46.291
- Hey, Niles. Frasier, you coming?
- In a minute, Dad.

16:46.580 --> 16:50.459
- Daph, what are you doing here?
- Helping Dr Crane with his dinner.

16:50.792 --> 16:55.263
- Hi. How are you doing? Marty Crane.
- Hi, I'm Phyllis Conrad.

16:55.631 --> 16:59.544
- You're Phyllis, huh?
- Don't worry. We'll be going soon.

16:59.885 --> 17:03.116
Dr Crane's
eager to have you all to himself.

17:03.430 --> 17:06.705
- Really?
- He's been going on about you all week.

17:07.017 --> 17:09.406
How pretty you are. How nice you dress.

17:09.685 --> 17:11.881
Dad, you don't want to be late.

17:12.146 --> 17:16.459
- I've embarrassed him. He's blushing.
- He's not the only one.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.093
Excuse me, Phyllis. Frasier, could I...

17:22.406 --> 17:25.922
- Help me get rid of her.
- I've got my hands full with Dad.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.679
You never had any idea
he had his eye on you?

17:28.956 --> 17:31.948
I caught him staring at me
in the elevator this morning.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.685
Now I know why.

17:34.962 --> 17:37.476
Dr Crane, would you give me a hand?

17:37.756 --> 17:38.825
Frasier?

17:39.049 --> 17:42.166
Dad, I guess it's time we were going.

17:42.469 --> 17:45.142
Maybe you could
go press for the elevator.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.990
All right.
Very nice meeting you, Phyllis.

17:51.937 --> 17:56.965
Well, your brother certainly kept
his feelings to himself until tonight.

17:57.359 --> 18:00.556
Yes, well,
he's always been the quiet type.

18:02.573 --> 18:06.964
Especially since all
the trouble with Heather.

18:07.327 --> 18:08.646
Heather?

18:08.871 --> 18:13.661
The pie should be heated and there's
cream to put on the strawberries.

18:14.042 --> 18:17.955
Or anything else,
should the night take that turn.

18:19.047 --> 18:22.357
- His wife was poisoned?
- He stood trial. They never proved it.

18:22.676 --> 18:24.587
Crab puffs?

18:27.514 --> 18:33.464
No, thank you. I just remembered,
there is someplace that I have to be.

18:33.896 --> 18:36.285
Thank you very much for the wine.

18:36.565 --> 18:38.556
Oh, my God, I drank the wine.

18:42.696 --> 18:45.574
- What did you tell her?
- I'll explain later, Niles.

18:45.866 --> 18:49.495
But don't plan on running for
the co-op board here anytime soon.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.033
- Where did Phyllis go?
- She left.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.885
She said she wasn't feeling well.

18:57.169 --> 19:01.606
Hope you don't mind my saying so. You
almost seem relieved that she's gone.

19:01.965 --> 19:07.403
Relieved? Well, Daphne,
to tell you the truth, I am relieved.

19:07.804 --> 19:11.433
I knew it. This is all my fault.

19:11.767 --> 19:15.601
It's as clear as day now.
You're just not ready for a relationship

19:15.938 --> 19:18.611
- and there I was pushing you into it.
- Daphne...

19:18.899 --> 19:21.459
I could see how uncomfortable
you were.

19:21.735 --> 19:25.330
She must have picked up on that, too,
and that's why she left.

19:25.656 --> 19:28.124
- What was I thinking?
- This is not your fault.

19:28.408 --> 19:33.038
Yes, but I should've seen. You're
on the rebound. You're still vulnerable.

19:33.413 --> 19:37.691
That's probably why you had so much
trouble asking for a simple date.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.350
Yes, I suppose you're right.

19:42.631 --> 19:47.989
I'm so sorry, Dr Crane. I guess
you just need to take some more time.

19:48.387 --> 19:53.097
If you rush things, you may ruin
something that has a real chance.

19:53.475 --> 19:58.265
No smart woman would get involved
with a man in the middle of a divorce.

19:58.647 --> 20:00.683
I know I never would.

20:00.941 --> 20:06.174
Well, thank you, Daphne.
This has all been very helpful.

20:06.572 --> 20:09.245
And thank you
for everything you did tonight,

20:09.533 --> 20:12.252
even if it didn't work out
exactly as I'd hoped.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.728
What are friends for?

20:19.668 --> 20:22.660
I suppose
we should start clearing all this up.

20:22.963 --> 20:23.952
Actually,

20:25.173 --> 20:26.162
Daphne,

20:27.843 --> 20:30.801
would you like to stay
and have dinner with me?

20:31.096 --> 20:33.564
- You mean that?
- Yes.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.405
Well, yes, that would be lovely.

20:38.979 --> 20:42.016
Wonderful. May I pour you some wine?

20:47.988 --> 20:51.298
You know, although it seems hopeless
right now,

20:51.617 --> 20:53.687
I have a feeling that before very long,

20:53.952 --> 20:57.991
you'll be sitting down to a romantic
dinner with the woman of your dreams.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.990
I think you may just be right.

21:02.502 --> 21:04.094
Shall we?

21:09.051 --> 21:10.040
Thank you.

21:21.355 --> 21:23.107
Here's to us.

21:27.778 --> 21:29.734
That's very nice.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.786
This is the most spectacular wine
I've ever tasted.

21:33.075 --> 21:34.793
I'm glad you like it.
