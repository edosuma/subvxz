WEBVTT

00:01.472 --> 00:03.003
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GET TRAVIS

00:03.003 --> 00:04.505
FOR HIS GRADUATION GIFT--

00:04.505 --> 00:06.237
THE ROBOT VACUUM,
UH, ELECTRIC BIKE,

00:06.237 --> 00:07.638
OR A ONE-PERSON HOVERCRAFT?

00:07.638 --> 00:09.740
DEFINITELY NOT
A ROBOT VACUUM.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.542
THOSE THINGS REALLY
CREEP ME OUT.

00:11.542 --> 00:13.384
I NEED MY VACUUMS
TO HAVE SOUL.

00:13.384 --> 00:15.186
HE DOESN'T GRADUATE
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

00:15.186 --> 00:17.648
I THOUGHT YOU AGREED TO CUT BACK
ON YOUR EARLY SHOPPING?

00:17.648 --> 00:19.150
OKAY, FINE.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.551
THEN I'LL JUST
MAKE SOME RETURNS,

00:20.551 --> 00:22.053
AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE GETTING

00:22.053 --> 00:24.024
FOR CHRISTMAS 2015.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.596
A SPRAY TAN PACKAGE!

00:25.596 --> 00:27.728
OH, HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
GET HIM THIS MASSAGE CHAIR?

00:27.728 --> 00:30.030
"PERFECT FOR THOSE TIMES
YOU WANNA BE TOUCHED,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.632
BUT YOU'RE ALL ALONE."

00:31.632 --> 00:34.165
YOU CAN HAVE THEM DELIVER IT
RIGHT TO HIS ROOM UPSTAIRS,

00:34.165 --> 00:36.207
WHERE HE'LL BE
FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.269
WHY WOULD TRAVIS BE
LIVING HERE AFTER GRADUATION?

00:38.269 --> 00:41.072
'CAUSE HE'S GRADUATING
FROM ART SCHOOL.

00:41.072 --> 00:42.573
OH, COME ON, ELLIE.

00:42.573 --> 00:44.445
NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT TRAV IS
AMBITIOUS, INDEPENDENT,

00:44.445 --> 00:48.119
AND HAS A FANTASTIC WORK ETHIC.

00:48.119 --> 00:50.481
(all laughing)

00:50.481 --> 00:53.654
(laughs)
WHY ARE WE LAUGHING?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.486
(Laurie, Ellie,
and Andy groan)

00:55.486 --> 01:00.491
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:00.491 --> 01:03.594
HEY, I WAS JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

01:03.594 --> 01:05.736
SO GRADUATION'S
IN A COUPLE MONTHS, HUH?

01:05.736 --> 01:07.768
YEAH. GUESS THAT'S RIGHT.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.271
IN THE EIGHT OR NINE YEARS
IT'LL TAKE YOU

01:10.271 --> 01:13.304
TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE MONEY
WITH AN ART DEGREE,

01:13.304 --> 01:14.845
WHAT DO YOU
SEE YOURSELF DOING?

01:14.845 --> 01:16.447
LOTTA IRONS IN THE FIRE.

01:16.447 --> 01:18.579
CAN'T WAIT TO,
UH, DIVE IN,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.811
GET MY HANDS DIRTY,
REALLY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.

01:20.811 --> 01:22.313
I GOTTA GO TO CLASS.
LATER.

01:22.313 --> 01:24.155
BYE, BABE.

01:24.155 --> 01:26.487
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE TRAVIS
HAS GOT A LOT GOING ON.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.688
THOSE ARE JUST
EMPTY BUZZWORDS.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.220
I DO THAT AT WORK

01:29.220 --> 01:30.461
WHEN I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING TO SAY.

01:30.461 --> 01:32.123
"YOU NEED TO PRIORITIZE,"

01:32.123 --> 01:34.225
"REFOCUS YOUR CAPITAL,"
"REALLY ATTACK THE MARKET."

01:34.225 --> 01:35.466
SHOULD I BE ATTACKING
THE MARKET?

01:35.466 --> 01:37.198
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.130
I DON'T MIND DATING A GUY
WHO PLAYS WITH ACTION FIGURES,

01:39.130 --> 01:41.472
I JUST DON'T THINK
I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM.

01:41.472 --> 01:43.534
DUDE NEEDS A J-O-B.

01:43.534 --> 01:45.236
I SHOULD GO.

01:45.236 --> 01:47.638
WE ARE TRYING TO GET STAN
INTO GULFHAVEN ACADEMY.

01:47.638 --> 01:50.641
THE WOMAN FROM ADMISSIONS
IS COMING BY THE HOUSE.

01:50.641 --> 01:52.713
THAT PLACE
IS CRAZY COMPETITIVE.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.415
THEY BARELY ACCEPT ANYONE.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.716
LIKE ME, BUT A SCHOOL.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.518
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

01:57.518 --> 01:58.749
YOU KNOW I NEED AT LEAST
AN HOUR TO TIE A WINDSOR KNOT.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.551
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

02:00.551 --> 02:02.122
YOU KNOW YOU GET ALL WEEPY
TALKING ABOUT STAN'S FUTURE,

02:02.122 --> 02:03.754
AND THEN YOU MAKE
A HUGE ASS OF YOURSELF.

02:03.754 --> 02:06.427
I'M COOL WITH STAN
GETTING OLDER...

02:06.427 --> 02:08.429
GOING TO SCHOOL...

02:08.429 --> 02:10.461
(voice breaks)
BECOMING A MAN.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.703
OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL YOURS, JULES. ENJOY.

02:12.703 --> 02:14.305
JUST LET IT OUT.

02:14.305 --> 02:16.737
(sobbing) IT'S LIKE
YESTERDAY HE WAS A BABY!

02:16.737 --> 02:18.509
LAURIE, WHERE'S JULES?

02:18.509 --> 02:20.140
WHOA, ARE YOU OKAY?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.512
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
CALL ME A NAME.

02:21.512 --> 02:23.574
THERE'S NO TIME,
TRAMPLE-STILTSKIN.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.846
OKAY, THERE'S A LITTLE TIME.
WHERE IS SHE?

02:25.846 --> 02:27.848
SHE'S SHOWING A HOUSE.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.850
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT YOUR INTERVIEW?
MY NANNY IS SICK.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.282
IF I DON'T HAVE SOMEONE
WATCHING STAN,

02:31.282 --> 02:32.783
HE MIGHT PUT
THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING

02:32.783 --> 02:34.185
IN MY SHAMPOO BOTTLE
AGAIN.

02:34.185 --> 02:35.526
HONEY, I'LL WATCH HIM.

02:35.526 --> 02:37.558
I USED TO TAKE CARE
OF MY 15 FOSTER SIBS.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.430
WELL, STAN
IS A MAJOR HANDFUL.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.831
BITCH, PLEASE.

02:40.831 --> 02:42.693
ONE OF MY BROTHERS
THOUGHT HE WAS A PIT BULL.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.335
I USED TO FILL A DOG TOY
WITH PEANUT BUTTER

02:44.335 --> 02:46.467
TO KEEP HIM FROM BITING.
I THINK I GOT THIS.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.800
(sighs) OKAY, BUT ONLY
BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.702
COME ON, HOOBA-SKANK!

02:51.702 --> 02:53.204
HEY! I'M DOING YOU
A FAVOR.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.405
I'M SORRY, IT'S REFLEX.

02:54.405 --> 02:55.776
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING.

02:55.776 --> 02:59.280
(under breath)
SLUT-BAG.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.181
BOBBY, WE NEED TO TALK.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.684
UH-OH.
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.216
EITHER SOMETHING'S GOING ON
WITH TRAVIS,

03:05.216 --> 03:07.187
OR YOUR AUNT GRACIE
DIED AGAIN.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.519
I ASKED TRAVIS
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO

03:08.519 --> 03:10.391
AFTER GRADUATION,

03:10.391 --> 03:12.923
AND HE SAID HE HAS A LOT
OF IRONS IN THE FIRE.

03:12.923 --> 03:16.297
SOUNDS LIKE OUR BOY
MEANS BUSINESS.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.668
NO, HE DOESN'T.

03:17.668 --> 03:19.430
I KNOW HE WANTS TO BE
A PHOTOGRAPHER,

03:19.430 --> 03:21.232
BUT THAT COULD TAKE
A REALLY LONG TIME.

03:21.232 --> 03:22.873
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO
FOR MONEY UNTIL THEN?

03:22.873 --> 03:24.705
PRETTY SOON,
TRAV WILL BE ON HIS OWN...

03:24.705 --> 03:26.377
(voice breaks)
OUT IN THE WORLD.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.708
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO, DUDE.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.209
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT, TOO?!

03:29.209 --> 03:30.641
DAMN IT.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.615
I DON'T WANT TRAVIS
TO BE ONE OF THOSE KIDS

03:34.615 --> 03:36.717
THAT FINISHES SCHOOL,
AND JUST SITS AROUND

03:36.717 --> 03:38.589
DOING NOTHING,
WAITING FOR HIS DREAM JOB.

03:38.589 --> 03:39.990
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

03:39.990 --> 03:42.353
YOU HOLD HIM SO CLOSE
HE NEVER GROWS UP.

03:42.353 --> 03:43.894
DUDE.
I'LL STOP.

03:43.894 --> 03:45.426
WE HAVE TO SIT TRAVIS DOWN,
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

03:45.426 --> 03:46.897
THAT HE HAS A PLAN.

03:46.897 --> 03:48.399
I'M IN. (clears throat)

03:48.399 --> 03:49.860
(slaps leg)
HELLO?

03:49.860 --> 03:52.803
HMM? OH, YOU MEANT NOW.
OH, COME ON. YEP, GOT IT.

03:55.306 --> 03:56.807
(sighs loudly)

03:56.807 --> 03:58.739
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DEALING
WITH SOMETHING.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.811
SO I'M JUST GONNA
LEAVE YOU WITH THAT AND...
(glass thuds)

04:00.811 --> 04:02.513
ELLIE KICKED ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

04:02.513 --> 04:04.415
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MYSELF.

04:04.415 --> 04:05.646
(chuckles)
ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:05.646 --> 04:07.378
IN MY FIRST MARRIAGE,

04:07.378 --> 04:09.650
MY FRIENDS AND I WOULD RAGE
WHEN OUR WIVES WERE BUSY.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.881
ME AND A BUDDY ONCE

04:10.881 --> 04:12.453
BROKE INTO
GLORIA ESTEFAN'S HOUSE

04:12.453 --> 04:14.285
AND TOOK A PICTURE
WITH HER GRAMMY.

04:14.285 --> 04:15.486
NOT THE AWARD--

04:15.486 --> 04:16.887
HER GRANDMOTHER
WAS HOUSE-SITTING.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.329
I DON'T KNOW.

04:18.329 --> 04:19.890
I MIGHT JUST PUT ON
MY COZY PANTS

04:19.890 --> 04:21.362
AND GET AN OIL CHANGE.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.534
TELL YOU WHAT--
JULES IS WITH TRAVIS,

04:23.534 --> 04:24.935
SO I'M GONNA HELP YOU OUT.

04:24.935 --> 04:26.997
WE'RE GONNA DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.600
SOMETHING CRAZY,
YOU NAME IT. BRO DAY!

04:29.600 --> 04:31.342
DO WE HAVE TO CALL IT
"BRO DAY"?

04:31.342 --> 04:32.603
WELL, I USED TO CALL IT
"DUDES ON THE DOWN LOW,"

04:32.603 --> 04:34.044
BUT TURNS OUT,
THAT MEANS SOMETHING ELSE.

04:35.946 --> 04:38.278
STAN'S TEST SCORES
ARE GREAT.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.911
BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR KIDS
FROM FAMILIES

04:40.911 --> 04:43.484
THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE...
DIVERSE.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.785
WELL, STAN'S HALF-CUBAN.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.817
THIS IS FLORIDA,
MRS. TORRES.

04:46.817 --> 04:48.689
I DARE YOU TO THROW A ROCK
AND NOT HIT A CUBAN.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.791
(door closes)
FIGURATIVELY.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.563
SORRY,
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

04:52.563 --> 04:53.994
I JUST NEED TO GRAB
STAN'S BOOKS.
(keys jangle)

04:53.994 --> 04:56.767
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE ONLY HAVE A FEW SPOTS LEFT.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.770
AND WE HOPE TO FILL THOSE
WITH A CHILD FROM SAY,

04:59.770 --> 05:03.073
A LOW-INCOME BRACKET
OR SINGLE-PARENT HOME,

05:03.073 --> 05:05.976
OR PERHAPS
AN ALTERNATIVE FAMILY.

05:05.976 --> 05:07.438
SO...

05:07.438 --> 05:08.809
(clears throat)
EXCUSE ME.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.542
OH, BABY GIRL.

05:14.645 --> 05:18.318
YOU KNOW I CAN'T RESIST YOU
WHEN YOU WEAR THIS SWEATER.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.091
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU WERE...

05:21.091 --> 05:24.725
YES, BIG-TIME.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.428
BIG-TIME.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.530
SO THIS GRADUATING THING
IS EXCITING.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.002
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOT OF IRONS IN THE FIRE.

05:32.002 --> 05:33.934
YEAH, YOU GOTTA CAST
A WIDE NET,

05:33.934 --> 05:35.806
BAIT THE HOOK,
SEE WHAT BITES.

05:35.806 --> 05:39.009
(laughs) MOVER AND SHAKER,
THIS GUY.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.471
OH, SORRY.

05:40.471 --> 05:41.972
WE BOTH SUPPORT
YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY,

05:41.972 --> 05:43.574
BUT THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.716
SO WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO IN THE MEANTIME?

05:45.716 --> 05:48.118
A TON--COOKING UP
AN ANIMATED WEB SERIES,

05:48.118 --> 05:49.980
MAY KICKSTART AN APP.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.752
AND IF MY BLOG GETS LINKED
TO HuffPo,

05:51.752 --> 05:53.353
SKY'S THE LIMIT.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.055
ALL I HEARD WAS "PO,"
"KICK," AND "APP."

05:55.055 --> 05:56.987
SO LET ME ASK YOU
ANOTHER WAY--

05:56.987 --> 05:59.460
UM, HOW ARE YOU GONNA
SUPPORT YOURSELF?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.792
PROBABLY JUST MOVE BACK HERE
UNTIL ONE OF MY IDEAS POPS.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.834
OH! AND I THOUGHT
OF AN IDEA FOR A REALITY SHOW

06:03.834 --> 06:05.466
ABOUT OLD FIREHOUSES.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.797
MY FRIEND'S COUSIN
LIVES NEXT TO A PRODUCER.

06:06.797 --> 06:09.099
SO... FINGERS CROSSED.

06:09.099 --> 06:12.142
(sighs) YEP,
WE RAISED A DEADBEAT.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.846
TRAV HAS NO INTEREST
IN A REAL JOB.

06:15.846 --> 06:18.679
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 20,
I-I WORKED AT A CAR WASH.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.611
I MEAN, I ONLY QUIT BECAUSE
ALL THE OLD MEN WERE YELLING,

06:20.611 --> 06:21.952
"PUT 'EM ON THE GLASS!"

06:21.952 --> 06:23.484
WHEN WE MET,
I WAS SELLING SHOES

06:23.484 --> 06:25.055
AT AN IRISH PUB.

06:25.055 --> 06:26.787
I WOULD STEAL THEM OFF
THE DRUNK GUYS

06:26.787 --> 06:28.919
AND SELL THEM BACK TO 'EM
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT.

06:28.919 --> 06:30.861
YEAH, WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT,
THERE WAS NO WAY

06:30.861 --> 06:32.463
I WASN'T MARRYING YOU.

06:32.463 --> 06:35.125
HEY, MAYBE TRAV CAN USE
A METAL DETECTOR

06:35.125 --> 06:37.698
AND COLLECT COINS
AT THE BEACH.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.029
NOW, WELL, HOW DO YOU
BUY A METAL DETECTOR

06:39.029 --> 06:40.501
WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY?

06:40.501 --> 06:41.732
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

06:41.732 --> 06:42.933
YEAH, I THINK TRAVIS
NEEDS A JOB

06:42.933 --> 06:46.677
THAT'S MORE... A JOB.

06:46.677 --> 06:48.639
THE MANAGER AT COFFEE BUCKS
LOVES ME.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.441
HE LETS ME PAY
FOR COFFEE IN HUGS.

06:50.441 --> 06:52.683
I BET HE'D GIVE TRAVIS
A JOB INTERVIEW.

06:52.683 --> 06:54.985
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU KISSED ME!

06:54.985 --> 06:56.447
PFFT. UGH.

06:56.447 --> 06:58.589
WHAT KISS?
YOU KISSED?

06:58.589 --> 06:59.950
W-WHERE WAS I
WHEN YOU KISSED?

06:59.950 --> 07:02.723
BIG DEAL.
THERE WAS NO TONGUE SLIP.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.726
THERE WAS NO TONGUE
BECAUSE I SHUT MY LIPS.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.858
I FELT YOU TRYING
TO POKE IN.

07:07.858 --> 07:10.030
OKAY, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.662
JELLY CLARKSON
MADE OUT WITH ME

07:11.662 --> 07:13.063
IN FRONT OF
THE ADMISSIONS REP,

07:13.063 --> 07:14.605
WHO NOW THINKS
WE'RE LOVERS.

07:14.605 --> 07:17.207
SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR KIDS

07:17.207 --> 07:19.009
FROM ALTERNATIVE FAMILIES.

07:19.009 --> 07:22.042
AS IN...
SAME-SEX COUPLES.
(cell phone rings)

07:22.042 --> 07:25.145
OH, GREAT.
THAT'S HER NOW.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.117
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?
I MEAN... DID YOU LIKE IT?

07:27.117 --> 07:28.779
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
THAT ELLIE WOULD BE

07:28.779 --> 07:30.651
A BETTER KISSER THAN ME?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.823
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD
MAKE A MAGNIFICENT GAY MAN.

07:32.823 --> 07:34.985
I'M A TENDER, OPEN-MINDED,
FREE SPIRIT,

07:34.985 --> 07:36.456
AND I GOT
A QUALITY UNIT.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.028
OH.

07:38.028 --> 07:40.761
WELL, STAN IS NOW VERY HIGH
ON THEIR WAITING LIST.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.864
THEY JUST INVITED ME
TO A PROSPECTIVE PARENT PICNIC.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.766
BOO-YAH! I TOLD YOU
IT WOULD WORK.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.467
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
LADY?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.999
THE PROBLEM IS
THAT SHE WANTS ME

07:48.999 --> 07:50.470
TO BRING MY PARTNER.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.774
OH. YEAH.
THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.976
GOODNESS, LOOK AT US.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.709
THE BEST OF FRIENDS
JUST LAUGHIN'...

07:58.709 --> 08:00.050
AND LOVIN'...

08:00.050 --> 08:01.512
AND KISSING?

08:01.512 --> 08:03.554
NOT NOW, SWEETIE.

08:03.554 --> 08:05.485
BRO TIME!
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.757
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

08:06.757 --> 08:09.259
UM, BEEF UP
MY SHELL COLLECTION,

08:09.259 --> 08:11.021
MAKE SOME FRUIT SMOOTHIES.

08:11.021 --> 08:13.594
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WANTED
TO GROW MY OWN BASIL.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.195
DUDE, YOU GOT
A FREE PASS HERE.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.067
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING
BRO-DACIOUS

08:17.067 --> 08:18.869
LIKE JET-SKIING,
CATFISHING,

08:18.869 --> 08:21.832
OR BODY SURFING,
OR MOTORCYCLING, SPELUNKING,

08:21.832 --> 08:23.173
OR DUNKING AND CRUNKING!

08:23.173 --> 08:25.275
I GUESS I'LL KNOW IT
WHEN I HEAR IT.

08:25.275 --> 08:27.007
HEY, GRAYSON?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.979
COULD I BORROW SOME OF THOSE
TINY DRINK UMBRELLAS?

08:28.979 --> 08:30.781
SNOWBALL AND I
ARE MAKING A CAT VIDEO.

08:30.781 --> 08:33.143
(gasps loudly)
CAT VIDEO!

08:33.143 --> 08:34.945
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:34.945 --> 08:36.286
YOU SAID
ANYTHING I WANT,

08:36.286 --> 08:38.819
AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT.
IT SOUNDS PURR-FECT.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.050
(laughs)

08:40.050 --> 08:41.792
MEOW WE'RE TALKIN'.

08:41.792 --> 08:44.755
(meows)
IT'LL BE KITTY FUN.

08:44.755 --> 08:46.226
(laughs)

08:46.226 --> 08:48.158
HEY, IT'S PRETTY COOL
YOU GOT TRAV AN INTERVIEW,

08:48.158 --> 08:50.160
BUT I DOUBT HE'S GONNA DIG
US EAVESDROPPIN'.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.764
PLEASE,
I'VE GOT THIS COVERED.

08:53.764 --> 08:57.067
(man)
SO, TRAVIS, TELL ME...

08:57.067 --> 08:59.269
WHY DO YOU WANNA WORK
FOR COFFEE BUCKS?

08:59.269 --> 09:02.042
(scoffs) WELL, "WANT" IS
A BIT OF AN OVERSTATEMENT.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.644
MY MOM FORCED ME
TO TAKE THIS INTERVIEW.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.115
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

09:05.115 --> 09:07.818
BONUS POINTS FOR HONESTY,
I SUPPOSE. (chuckles)

09:07.818 --> 09:10.320
UH, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?

09:10.320 --> 09:11.882
SCI-FI MOVIE TRIVIA,

09:11.882 --> 09:13.553
IRONIC T-SHIRT IDEAS,
SUBTLE SARCASTIC PUT-DOWNS--

09:13.553 --> 09:14.885
NICE TIE, BY THE WAY.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.226
OH, THANK YOU.

09:16.226 --> 09:17.628
NOT A STRONG START.

09:17.628 --> 09:19.129
BUT HE COULD STILL
PUT IT AROUND.

09:19.129 --> 09:21.031
BUT YOU ARE PASSIONATE
ABOUT COFFEE.

09:21.031 --> 09:24.234
UH... COFFEE? (laughs)

09:24.234 --> 09:26.667
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT
PHOTOGRAPHY,

09:26.667 --> 09:28.839
PASSIONATE ABOUT
MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.570
OH, YEAH.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.973
WHAT KIND OF WEIRDO
IS PASSIONATE ABOUT COFFEE?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.606
THIS WEIRDO IS PASSIONATE
ABOUT COFFEE.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.277
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.050
I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO PAY WITH HUGS ANYMORE.

09:40.050 --> 09:41.852
YEAH.

09:41.852 --> 09:44.584
IF THERE IS ANYTHING FUNNIER
THAN A CAT C.P.A.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.856
WITH A TINY BRIEFCASE...

09:45.856 --> 09:47.958
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.319
YOU KNOW,
ON MY LAST BRO DAY,

09:49.319 --> 09:50.761
MY BUDDY AND I
TOOK A CIGARETTE BOAT

09:50.761 --> 09:52.623
TO GET CUBAN FOOD...

09:52.623 --> 09:53.864
IN CUBA.

09:53.864 --> 09:55.065
(meows)
I SHOULD GET SOME TUNA.

09:55.065 --> 09:56.967
SNOWBALL CAN GET
A LITTLE BRATTY

09:56.967 --> 09:58.228
IF HIS BLOOD SUGAR DROPS.

09:58.228 --> 10:00.130
IT'S HARD WORK BEING
A CAT-COUNTANT.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.772
A CAT-COUNTANT?!

10:01.772 --> 10:03.103
CAN YOU NOT SEE YOURSELVES?
LOOK AT YOU,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.905
YOU'RE TWO GROWN MEN
TRYING TO PUT A CAT

10:04.905 --> 10:08.138
IN A BOW TIE AND A POCKET
PROTECTOR. IT'S SO STUPID.

10:08.138 --> 10:09.710
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST MAKE HIM
SOMETHING COOL,

10:09.710 --> 10:11.081
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

10:11.081 --> 10:12.783
YOU KNOW, LIKE A BARTENDER
OR SOMETHING.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.115
YOU MEAN, CAT-TENDER?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.287
YEAH, LIKE A--
LIKE A CAT-TENDER.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.690
TO THE PUB!

10:19.690 --> 10:22.292
OKAY, WE ARE ONLY GOING ALONG
WITH THIS INSANITY

10:22.292 --> 10:23.754
UNTIL I FIND A WAY
TO STRAIGHTEN

10:23.754 --> 10:24.955
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

10:24.955 --> 10:26.296
OKAY, WELL,
AS LONG AS WE ARE A COUPLE,

10:26.296 --> 10:27.958
MY RELATIONSHIP DEMANDS
ARE AS FOLLOWS--

10:27.958 --> 10:30.160
CONSTANT TOUCHING,
SURPRISE KISSES,

10:30.160 --> 10:32.903
CASUAL BOOB GRAZES,
AND REGULAR COMPLIMENTS.

10:32.903 --> 10:36.006
SOME GOOD AREAS TO FOCUS ON--
MY EYES, HAIR, FEET.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.238
I'M OUT.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.111
MRS. TORRES,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

10:41.111 --> 10:43.844
IT'S SO NICE TO BE HERE...
WITH MY PARTNER.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.916
WE ARE LOVERS,
ABOVE ALL ELSE.

10:45.916 --> 10:47.748
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
LOVER?

10:47.748 --> 10:48.979
YES, LOVER.

10:48.979 --> 10:51.281
AW! YOU HAVE THAT LOOK
IN YOUR EYE,

10:51.281 --> 10:53.684
LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO PAY ME A COMPLIMENT.

10:53.684 --> 10:55.225
YOU'RE... PRETTY,

10:55.225 --> 11:00.931
PARTICULARLY IN THE HAIR,
EYE, AND FEET AREA.

11:00.931 --> 11:03.994
IT'S INSPIRING TO SEE
A COUPLE SO IN LOVE.

11:03.994 --> 11:06.296
I CAN'T KEEP MY HANDS
OFF HER.

11:06.296 --> 11:08.739
AW.
HIGHWAY TO THE LADY ZONE.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.140
WHAT-WHAT?

11:10.140 --> 11:12.272
WHAT-WHAT, INDEED.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.774
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
IT WOULDN'T COME TO THIS,

11:13.774 --> 11:16.807
BUT TRAV HAS NO JOB,
NO PLAN,

11:16.807 --> 11:18.208
AND NO RESPECT FOR MONEY.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.150
IT'S TIME
TO SCARE HIM STRAIGHT.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.783
AND I AM THE POSTER BOY
FOR ZERO AMBITION--

11:22.783 --> 11:25.015
LIVING ON A LAND BOAT,
HAND-TO-MOUTH,

11:25.015 --> 11:28.288
AND I USE A COSTO-SIZED BAG
OF OYSTER CRACKERS AS A PILLOW.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.720
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ROLL UP A TOWEL?

11:29.720 --> 11:30.921
WHAT WOULD I PUT
UNDER THE DOOR

11:30.921 --> 11:32.222
TO KEEP THE SNAKES OUT?

11:32.222 --> 11:33.423
WHAT'S UP,
PARENTAL UNIT?

11:33.423 --> 11:35.425
TRAVIS, HAVE A SEAT.

11:36.927 --> 11:40.831
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT MY LIFE, SON.

11:40.831 --> 11:43.373
LAST NIGHT I HAD
SIX DORITOS LOCOS TACOS

11:43.373 --> 11:45.375
AND FELL ASLEEP NAKED
UNDER THE STARS,

11:45.375 --> 11:46.807
'CAUSE I GOT NO JOB

11:46.807 --> 11:48.809
AND NOWHERE TO BE
WHEN I WAKE UP.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.111
SOUNDS... AMAZING.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.813
IT'S AWFUL.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.414
YOU KNOW, HE HAS TO STEAL
HIS ELECTRICITY

11:54.414 --> 11:57.287
FROM A SUSHI RESTAURANT/
GAS STATION.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.119
OF COURSE, IF HE WAS
WILLING TO GET A JOB,

11:59.119 --> 12:01.491
HE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS
PATHETIC SITUATION.

12:01.491 --> 12:04.154
(under breath) I DON'T KNOW
IF IT WAS PATHETIC.

12:04.154 --> 12:06.496
IT'S PATHETIC
AND EMBARRASSING.

12:06.496 --> 12:08.899
(gruff voice) AND THAT'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU, BOY.

12:08.899 --> 12:11.461
IS THIS SOME TYPE OF
"SCARED STRAIGHT" ROUTINE?

12:11.461 --> 12:13.333
TRAVIS, YOU NEED
A WAKE-UP CALL.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.266
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW YOU ACTED IN THAT INTERVIEW.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.508
SO YOU WERE SPYING ON ME
IN THE INTERVIEW?

12:18.508 --> 12:21.441
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET ME
DO ANYTHING ON MY OWN?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.373
YEAH, JULES, WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS HAVE TO MEDDLE?

12:23.373 --> 12:25.215
(lowered voice) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING? WE'RE A TEAM.

12:25.215 --> 12:26.947
(lowered voice) WE WERE UNTIL
YOU THREW ME UNDER THE BUS.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.178
YES, BUT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO THROW YOU

12:28.178 --> 12:29.419
UNDER THE BUS TOGETHER.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.081
THIS IS CRAZY!
I'M OUTTA HERE.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.854
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M OUTTA HERE, TOO.

12:33.854 --> 12:37.187
WELL, I'M OUTTA HERE,
TOO!

12:37.187 --> 12:40.130
DAMN IT! THIS IS NOT
AN EASY PLACE

12:40.130 --> 12:43.033
TO STORM OUT OF.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.768
WHOA. YOU'RE REALLY
SUCKING IT DOWN, HUH?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.300
YEAH, SO WHAT?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.542
YOUR WINE IS LIKE CRAP,
PRETZELS ARE STALE.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.875
WHAT'S THAT
STUPID PHOTOGRAPH?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.776
OH, THAT'S ME
AND MY BUDDY BLAKE

12:56.776 --> 12:58.348
WITH GLORIA ESTEFAN'S
GRAMMY.

12:58.348 --> 13:00.010
WE WERE BEING BRO-DACIOUS.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.112
WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY
KINDA COOL. (chuckles)

13:02.112 --> 13:03.854
I'M SORRY, HONEY,
I'M JUST--

13:03.854 --> 13:05.785
I'M UPSET ABOUT THIS
TRAVIS THING.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.558
AND BOBBY COMPLETELY RUINED
OUR "SCARED STRAIGHT" ROUTINE.

13:08.558 --> 13:10.060
THAT NEVER WORKS.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.322
ALTHOUGH, I DO DO
A GREAT ANGRY INMATE.

13:12.322 --> 13:15.826
(gruff voice) BOY, YOU DON'T
WANNA COME INTO MY WORLD.

13:15.826 --> 13:17.097
I'LL SLAP SOME STRAWBERRY
LIP GLOSS ON YOU

13:17.097 --> 13:19.930
AND MAKE YOU MY WOMAN.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.501
OOH, CAN WE DO THAT
TONIGHT?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.103
WHAT? NO.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.504
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE
THE "SCARED STRAIGHT" THING

13:24.504 --> 13:26.106
WAS A DUMB IDEA.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.377
BUT I JUST--I WANT TRAVIS
TO START THINKING

13:27.377 --> 13:28.939
ABOUT HIS FUTURE.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.510
I DIDN'T START WORKING
RIGHT AFTER COLLEGE,

13:30.510 --> 13:32.112
AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.413
I'M A SUCCESSFUL,
RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS OWNER.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.186
GRAYSON, LOOK AT THESE
PROSTHETIC CAT PAWS

13:36.186 --> 13:39.019
SO SNOWBALL CAN MIX DRINKS.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.551
(chuckles) I DIDN'T--
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

13:41.551 --> 13:44.154
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS BACK THERE.

13:44.154 --> 13:45.825
I KNOW I MEDDLE
IN TRAVIS' LIFE.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.197
I JUST--I WANT HIM
TO MAKE SMART CHOICES

13:47.197 --> 13:48.458
SO HE DOESN'T END UP
STRUGGLING

13:48.458 --> 13:50.000
LIKE BOBBY AND I DID.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.301
LOOK,
HE'S 22 YEARS OLD NOW.

13:51.301 --> 13:52.602
HE'S GONNA DO
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO,

13:52.602 --> 13:54.404
AND IF YOU'VE
RAISED HIM RIGHT,

13:54.404 --> 13:56.266
THEN HE ALREADY HAS THE TOOLS
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.869
BESIDES, WE KNOW HE'S MATURE.
I MEAN, ALL HE DOES

13:58.869 --> 14:00.470
IS HANG WITH
A BUNCH OF ADULTS.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.242
GRAYSON,
THE MUSTACHE YOU MADE

14:02.242 --> 14:04.144
WON'T STICK
TO SNOWBALL'S WHISKERS.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.916
WE NEED A CAT-SAFE
ADHESIVE.

14:05.916 --> 14:08.518
ARE YOU TRYING TO TIME THESE
FOR MAXIMUM EMBARRASSMENT?

14:08.518 --> 14:09.920
(chuckles) YEAH.
BUT SERIOUSLY,

14:09.920 --> 14:11.221
WE NEED YOUR HELP
WITH THE WHISKERS.

14:13.924 --> 14:16.957
ELLIE WAS MY PSYCH T.A.
IN COLLEGE,

14:16.957 --> 14:18.989
SO I ASKED FOR STUDY HELP,

14:18.989 --> 14:22.032
AND SHE SAID OFFICE HOURS
WERE THAT NIGHT AT HER HOUSE.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.364
WELL,
BOTTLE OF TEQUILA LATER,

14:24.364 --> 14:27.867
WE'RE ALL TANGLED UP
IN A BUBBLE BATH.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.369
THE REST IS HISTORY.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.941
IT'S LIKE OUR STORY
WAS LIFTED

14:30.941 --> 14:33.503
STRAIGHT OFF THE PAGES
OF "MAXIM" MAGAZINE.

14:33.503 --> 14:36.006
OH, OH, BABY.

14:36.006 --> 14:39.349
MAYBE DIAL IT BACK
A NOTCH, L-WORD.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.051
I DON'T DO RELATIONSHIPS
HALFWAY.

14:41.051 --> 14:42.482
QUICK, THE MURRAYS
ARE LOOKING.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.484
STICK YOUR TONGUE IN MY EAR.
MAKE IT DEEP.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.386
AT WHAT ROADSIDE
TRUCK STOP

14:46.386 --> 14:48.558
DID YOU LEARN ABOUT
RELATIONSHIPS?

14:48.558 --> 14:51.061
I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST SIT HERE, UNLOVED,

14:51.061 --> 14:53.493
BY A SEETHING BALL
OF NEGATIVITY.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.596
WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT
A GIANT PIT OF NEED.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.428
I'M SORRY THAT
I'M SO NEEDY!

14:58.428 --> 15:01.101
YOU'RE JUST A COLD FISH.
YOU NEVER TOUCH ME!

15:01.101 --> 15:03.173
WE'RE AT A PUBLIC EVENT.

15:03.173 --> 15:05.675
THIS IS NOT THE IDEAL PLACE
FOR EAR SEX

15:05.675 --> 15:07.337
AND A FULL-BODY RUBDOWN.

15:07.337 --> 15:09.479
ALL YOU DO
IS TAKE ME FOR GRANTED.

15:09.479 --> 15:11.611
I GIVE AND I GIVE
AND I GIVE

15:11.611 --> 15:13.443
TO BE THE VERY BEST
LESBIAN I CAN,

15:13.443 --> 15:14.985
AND YOU NEVER CARE!

15:14.985 --> 15:17.447
I AM DONE. DO YOU HEAR ME?

15:17.447 --> 15:19.689
DONE!

15:19.689 --> 15:21.421
EXCUSE ME.

15:24.524 --> 15:28.058
WE FIGHT BECAUSE WE LOVE.

15:28.058 --> 15:29.599
UH, EXCUSE ME.
(meows)

15:29.599 --> 15:32.162
WHY IS OUR CAT-TENDER
WEARING A HAWAIIAN SHIRT?

15:32.162 --> 15:35.135
OH, BECAUSE HE'S A FLAIR CAT,
LIKE TOM CRUISE IN "COCKTAIL."

15:35.135 --> 15:36.606
WHOO!

15:36.606 --> 15:39.639
I DON'T KNOW HOW CATS
WORK WITH THESE THINGS.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.572
WE ARE NOT DOING
SOME CHEESY CAT-TAIL RIP-OFF.

15:42.572 --> 15:44.714
SNOWBALL
IS A FILM NOIR CAT,

15:44.714 --> 15:46.246
SERVING UP MARTINIS

15:46.246 --> 15:48.048
TO HARD-BOILED
HUMPHREY BOGART TYPES.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.250
WHO'S EVER HEARD
OF A FILM NOIR CAT?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.082
WHO'S EVER HEARD
OF A "COCKTAIL" CAT?

15:52.082 --> 15:54.284
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS A HEALTHY CAT-MOSPHERE.

15:54.284 --> 15:57.087
THIS IS MY BRO DAY,
AND I WANNA DO "CAT-SABLANCA."

15:57.087 --> 15:58.958
WELL, THIS IS MY BAR,
AND I WANNA DO "CAT-TAIL."

15:58.958 --> 16:00.160
THIS IS MY CAT--

16:00.160 --> 16:01.461
(Andy and Grayson)
SHUT UP, TOM!

16:01.461 --> 16:03.063
YOU SHOULD NOT
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.464
(meows)

16:04.464 --> 16:06.666
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.568
HEY, TRAV.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.540
LOOK, I JUST GOT YOUR TEXT.
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD.
SIT.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.202
OKAY, SON,
I GOT YOUR TEXT,

16:12.202 --> 16:13.743
AND I KNOW
YOU'RE PISSED OFF.

16:13.743 --> 16:16.006
PARK IT.
OOH. SHOOT.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.078
(sighs) YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS WALKING AWAY

16:18.078 --> 16:20.180
FROM THE BOAT EARLIER,
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

16:20.180 --> 16:23.153
"WHO ELSE BUT MY PARENTS
WOULD COME UP WITH AN IDEA

16:23.153 --> 16:25.585
AS STUPID AS
A 'SCARED STRAIGHT' ROUTINE?"

16:25.585 --> 16:27.317
IT SEEMED SO SMART
WHEN WE THOUGHT OF IT.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.159
I WAS IMPRESSED WITH US.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.990
I WAS MAD THAT YOU'D
TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.622
SO I FIGURED I'D IGNORE YOU
FOR A FEW DAYS,

16:32.622 --> 16:34.094
MAKE YOU COME TO ME
AND APOLOGIZE.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.365
BUT THAT SEEMED
LIKE THE BEHAVIOR

16:35.365 --> 16:37.597
OF, WELL, A CHILD.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.601
SO, THOUGHT I'D TRY SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE ADULT.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.273
OH, MAN.

16:43.273 --> 16:45.004
AM I ABOUT TO GET
PUNCHED IN THE FACE?
NO, DAD.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.737
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO SAY THANKS.

16:47.737 --> 16:49.539
EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOW IT

16:49.539 --> 16:52.312
IN AMAZINGLY STUPID WAYS
SOMETIMES,

16:52.312 --> 16:54.644
I KNOW YOU GUYS CARE
ABOUT ME.

16:54.644 --> 16:57.647
AND I THINK YOU GUYS
ARE GREAT PARENTS.

16:57.647 --> 17:00.590
OH, MY LITTLE BOY
HAS GOTTEN SO DADGUM MATURE.

17:00.590 --> 17:03.253
NOT REALLY HELPING
THE ADULT VIBE, MOM.

17:03.253 --> 17:05.695
LET'S GET IN THERE
AND GRAB SOME COFFEE.

17:05.695 --> 17:08.728
I THINK THAT WENT OKAY.
YES, IT DID.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.760
I'M SO GONNA HAVE
TO PAY FOR THESE COFFEES.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.133
YES, YOU ARE.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.235
WHY DID YOU DRAW WHISKERS
ON YOUR FACE?

17:15.235 --> 17:16.636
I AM PLAYING
SNOWBALL'S BAR BACK.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.138
IT'S CALLED COMMITTING.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.669
WELL, I HOPE YOU CAN COMMIT
TO FLAIR CAT,

17:19.669 --> 17:21.511
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE DOING.

17:21.511 --> 17:22.772
OH! PFFT.

17:22.772 --> 17:24.774
LOOK AT ME,
I HAVE FLAIR! OH!

17:24.774 --> 17:29.219
WELL, LOOK AT ME!
I'M A FILM NOIR RIP-OFF.

17:29.219 --> 17:30.580
(imitating Humphrey Bogart)
HER GAMS WENT ALL THE WAY

17:30.580 --> 17:32.382
FROM HER PAWS TO HER EARS.

17:32.382 --> 17:35.054
I COULD TELL FROM THE START
THAT THIS TABBY WAS TROUBLE.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.427
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

17:37.427 --> 17:39.429
WE'RE HAVING AWESOME BRO TIME.

17:39.429 --> 17:41.461
OH, WAIT.
ARE WE TAKING A FIVE?

17:41.461 --> 17:43.593
THIS ISN'T BRO-DACIOUS
AT ALL.

17:43.593 --> 17:45.535
YEAH, I GUESS I CAN'T
GET AS WILD AS I USED TO.

17:45.535 --> 17:47.497
(Laurie) DO YOU THINK MAYBE
I COULD GET A DRINK?

17:47.497 --> 17:50.440
ELLIE AND I BROKE UP.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.273
OH, I'M SORRY.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.575
SHE'S LIKE A TORNADO.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.578
SHE SWEEPS YOU UP,
KNOCKS YOU DOWN,

17:58.578 --> 17:59.849
AND AS MUCH AS IT HURTS,

17:59.849 --> 18:02.482
YOU JUST WANT HER
TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.654
YOU SMELL LIKE CAT LITTER.

18:06.516 --> 18:08.288
HEY.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.519
I WANNA APOLOGIZE.

18:09.519 --> 18:11.291
I KNOW YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.223
I'M SORRY I GOT
SO CARRIED AWAY.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.195
IT'S JUST...
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE

18:15.195 --> 18:17.227
TO GO TO A GREAT SCHOOL
LIKE THAT.

18:17.227 --> 18:19.729
AND... I REALLY WANTED IT
TO WORK OUT FOR STAN.

18:19.729 --> 18:23.533
AND IT'S SO SWEET THAT YOU
CARE ABOUT HIM SO MUCH.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.135
I REALLY DO.

18:25.135 --> 18:28.438
AND IF THERE WAS A TRUTH GUN
TO MY HEAD,

18:28.438 --> 18:30.240
I REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOU, TOO.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.213
I FEEL THE SAME.

18:33.213 --> 18:37.317
MAN, I'M SORRY
FOR BEING SUCH A JERK.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.690
I'M SORRY FOR BEING SO...

18:40.690 --> 18:42.492
I'M TEMPTED TO SAY "CATTY."

18:42.492 --> 18:44.194
DON'T.

18:44.194 --> 18:46.656
I JUST WISH I HADN'T
RUINED EVERYTHING TODAY.

18:46.656 --> 18:48.428
THAT SCHOOL'S
TOO PRETENTIOUS FOR STAN.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.701
HE DESERVES BETTER.

18:51.701 --> 18:55.765
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
YOU WERE A GREAT GIRLFRIEND.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.407
THANKS.

18:57.407 --> 19:00.240
YOU WERE A REALLY GOOD
GIRLFRIEND, TOO.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.471
(mouths words)
(Ellie) AND YOU'RE
A GREAT KISSER.

19:01.471 --> 19:03.142
YOU WEREN'T BAD,
YOURSELF.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.514
THANK YOU.

19:04.514 --> 19:06.246
MM.
AW.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.378
THE CAMERA'S NOT
EVEN HERE.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.550
(camera clatters)

19:10.550 --> 19:12.522
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
I SAID ABOUT YOU ON THE BOAT.

19:12.522 --> 19:13.883
YOU'RE NOT PATHETIC.

19:13.883 --> 19:15.325
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET THROUGH TO TRAV.

19:15.325 --> 19:16.726
I KNOW, JULES.

19:16.726 --> 19:18.428
YOU KNOW, WE BOTH JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

19:18.428 --> 19:20.590
AND WE MAY NOT GET THROUGH
TO HIM ALL THE TIME,

19:20.590 --> 19:24.394
BUT OVERALL, I'D SAY
WE DID ALL RIGHT.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.496
WELCOME TO COFFEE BUCKS.
CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER?

19:26.496 --> 19:28.167
(Bobby) TRAV, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING BACK THERE?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.369
DID YOU STEAL THAT APRON?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.640
YOU'RE GONNA GET
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE!

19:30.640 --> 19:33.243
GUYS, I WORK HERE NOW.

19:33.243 --> 19:34.874
I CALLED THE MANAGER
AND ASKED FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.346
SO... WHAT CAN I GET FOR YA?

19:36.346 --> 19:37.607
IT'S MY FIRST SHIFT,

19:37.607 --> 19:38.808
I ONLY KNOW
HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.

19:38.808 --> 19:40.310
TWO COFFEES.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.951
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

19:41.951 --> 19:43.953
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TAKE YOUR MONEY.

19:43.953 --> 19:45.415
MY COFFEES ARE FREE?

19:45.415 --> 19:47.917
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
EXACTLY FREE...

19:47.917 --> 19:51.591
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

19:51.591 --> 19:54.864
AHH.
OOH.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.826
MMM.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.399
(chuckles)

19:59.399 --> 20:01.571
(sighs)

20:01.571 --> 20:03.833
IS THIS THE WORST COFFEE
YOU'VE EVER HAD?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.305
(spits)

20:05.305 --> 20:07.407
MAN, IT TASTES
LIKE DIRT AND WATER.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.878
UGH.

20:08.878 --> 20:10.340
(chuckles)

20:12.612 --> 20:15.615
(slow jazz playing)

20:18.518 --> 20:21.751
(door creaks)

20:26.796 --> 20:29.329
(imitating Christopher Walken)
WOW. WHAT'LL IT BE, PAL?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.830
(imitating Humphrey Bogart)
DO YOU KNOW THE MUG

20:30.830 --> 20:32.231
AT THE END OF THE BAR?
SKINNY SAL?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.565
BIG DRINKER, BAD TIPPER.
HA HA, MEOW.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.637
HE'S NOT AS DUMB
AS HE LOOKS.

20:37.637 --> 20:41.240
(ice cubes rattling)
HE'S THE TOP MONEY MAN FOR--

20:41.240 --> 20:42.842
WHOA.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.814
HE'S NOT AS DUMB AS HE LOOKS.
HE'S THE TOP--

20:44.814 --> 20:46.946
(normal voice)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
(music stops)

20:46.946 --> 20:49.819
(lowered voice)
THESE PAWS SUCK...

20:49.819 --> 20:52.452
UM... CESSFULLY HELP ME
CATCH MICE.
(music resumes)

20:52.452 --> 20:56.286
(sighs) SNOWBALL'S NEVER
GONNA FORGIVE ME FOR THIS.

20:56.286 --> 20:57.657
(meows)
