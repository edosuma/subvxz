00:00.440 --> 00:01.839
Here he comes!

00:11.521 --> 00:13.789
Thank you very much.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.916
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:19.236 --> 00:23.139
Six commandos in here. I
counted four in the hallway.

00:23.164 --> 00:25.041
That goon over there in the blue shirt.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.934
With all the scruff, looking around?

00:27.969 --> 00:29.227
He was on <i> Solace.</i>

00:29.252 --> 00:31.219
He recognizes me, we got problems.

00:31.244 --> 00:33.078
Sir, is that really the president?

00:33.103 --> 00:35.040
Well, if everyone in the
bunker's really dead, yeah,

00:35.065 --> 00:36.265
he was next in line.

00:36.290 --> 00:37.961
How are you?

00:37.986 --> 00:40.054
Looks to me like he's playing a part.

00:42.706 --> 00:46.195
His body language, expression,

00:46.220 --> 00:48.989
the way the two guys are up against him.

00:49.023 --> 00:50.190
Nice to meet you.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.922
He's being held against his will.

00:52.947 --> 00:54.821
If they have him, and they can somehow

00:54.846 --> 00:57.748
piece the country together,
get communications up,

00:57.773 --> 00:59.540
they'll control everything...

00:59.629 --> 01:02.264
the Federal Reserve, the military.

01:02.289 --> 01:04.056
Well, that's not gonna happen.

01:04.081 --> 01:05.781
Thank you very much.

01:05.806 --> 01:06.907
One way or another, we're getting

01:06.932 --> 01:09.606
our commander in chief out of here.

01:27.519 --> 01:31.852
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:02.962 --> 02:04.629
Cover for me.

02:04.654 --> 02:06.755
- Need some help there, boss?
- Yeah, man. Thanks.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.229
What is this place anyway?

02:08.253 --> 02:10.142
Lots of people, lots of mouths to feed.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.367
Yeah?

02:13.349 --> 02:15.083
That's a go for Tiger Team.

02:15.108 --> 02:16.697
Sir, we've got Tiger.

02:21.042 --> 02:23.176
Green, tell me the
C.O.'s standing with you.

02:23.201 --> 02:24.478
That's a negative, sir.

02:24.503 --> 02:26.104
No contact or visual with Vulture Team.

02:26.129 --> 02:29.541
I'm on a rooftop 500 yards
North of your whiskey Tiger.

02:29.566 --> 02:33.018
- What's your con ops?
- Well, sir, we are improvising.

02:33.043 --> 02:35.144
All seems quiet in the compound.

02:35.169 --> 02:37.137
C.O. most likely got in undetected.

02:37.162 --> 02:39.598
Yeah, or he walked in and
they pointed a gun to his head.

02:39.623 --> 02:41.085
What's our rally point, Taylor?

02:41.120 --> 02:42.739
There's a baseball
field a half a mile North

02:42.764 --> 02:44.169
of my whiskey.

02:44.194 --> 02:47.101
At 30.275 North,

02:47.126 --> 02:49.340
81.462 west.

02:49.365 --> 02:53.920
Copy, 30.275 North,
81.462 west, ball field.

02:53.944 --> 02:56.567
- Big enough to land our helo.
- That's the idea.

02:56.592 --> 02:59.665
Roger, out. Find that.

03:00.950 --> 03:03.018
Green, you've got company.

03:03.043 --> 03:05.228
Signing off.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.287
All right, boys!

03:07.319 --> 03:08.751
Stack the boxes on the dollies

03:08.776 --> 03:10.143
and roll 'em toward the side door.

03:10.168 --> 03:11.950
All right.

03:15.276 --> 03:16.751
I got that one.

03:16.776 --> 03:18.944
This goes to the scientist.

03:19.411 --> 03:21.879
Whatever you say.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.713
Impressive work, my friend.
This is more than I expected.

03:33.738 --> 03:37.012
Ah, when the message is true,
people are sure to follow.

03:37.037 --> 03:38.846
They can.

03:44.256 --> 03:46.224
There's still no contact with the sub.

03:46.249 --> 03:49.126
I'm tellin' ya, it's that destroyer.

03:49.152 --> 03:51.220
It's probably a problem with the repeater.

03:51.254 --> 03:54.086
Ian knows he's not supposed
to talk to us direct.

03:54.111 --> 03:56.721
Or maybe they're under attack.

03:56.746 --> 03:58.246
Maybe he's sunk.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.744
If he's sunk, he's sunk.
Nothing we can do about it now.

04:00.769 --> 04:01.939
You can't be serious.

04:01.964 --> 04:04.933
Nothing we can do about it now.

04:05.051 --> 04:06.886
Got it?

04:07.099 --> 04:09.200
Okay, brother.

04:10.663 --> 04:13.262
I got it.

04:13.994 --> 04:15.662
Right.

04:16.623 --> 04:20.762
The boys saw a few stragglers
in that last supply run.

04:21.017 --> 04:24.386
They're living in a trailer park in the 1-15.

04:24.421 --> 04:27.375
Niels has got a new magic
trick he wants to try.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.600
You're gonna go with him. Get in that van.

04:30.869 --> 04:33.001
Go on.

04:40.804 --> 04:43.839
Sir, the rally point is here,
just North of Jacksonville.

04:43.970 --> 04:46.551
We'll be in range to
launch our helo from here

04:46.576 --> 04:48.400
in about two hours depending on headwinds.

04:48.425 --> 04:50.355
Can't launch from open water,
not with the sub listening.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.581
You gotta find me a more protected spot.

04:54.684 --> 04:57.033
There's the mouth of the St. John's River.

04:57.058 --> 04:59.159
Uh, the land mass should be
able to block our location

04:59.184 --> 05:01.382
if they try to ping us, but...

05:01.407 --> 05:03.781
It'll take an extra hour to get there, sir.

05:07.463 --> 05:09.174
O.O.D., set a new course

05:09.199 --> 05:10.392
for the mouth of the St. John's River.

05:10.417 --> 05:12.876
- O.O.D., aye. Quiet one, sir?
- Yes.

05:12.902 --> 05:15.315
Helmsman, come left, steer course 3-2-5.

05:15.339 --> 05:17.040
Activate prairie masker
to conceal our frequencies.

05:17.065 --> 05:18.712
Hold at 12 knots.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.801
Hey! What are you doing over there?

07:08.826 --> 07:11.060
Uh, chill out, man. Just...

07:11.354 --> 07:12.972
Just taking a piss.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.979
- Well, get back to work.
- You got it.

07:23.813 --> 07:25.043
Appreciate it.

07:25.068 --> 07:27.036
Thank you.

07:27.061 --> 07:27.969
Mighty grateful to you, sir.

07:27.994 --> 07:29.995
Pleasure to meet you.

07:30.020 --> 07:31.927
It is an honor and a pleasure.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.727
Thank you.

07:33.751 --> 07:35.827
- Thank you, sir.
- It's okay.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.250
Oh, my goodness.

07:39.275 --> 07:41.177
Look at the size of this guy, huh?

07:42.728 --> 07:44.776
He's a big kid.

07:46.397 --> 07:49.276
You are special, young
man. You were chosen.

07:50.258 --> 07:52.276
Like all of us.

08:06.511 --> 08:08.212
Whatever we do, we need to do it fast.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.671
They're moving the president tonight.

08:09.696 --> 08:11.687
- To New Orleans?
- Whoa. Where'd you hear that?

08:11.712 --> 08:13.212
Guard at the courtyard.

08:13.237 --> 08:15.312
Tossed my hair a bit. He gave up the goods.

08:15.337 --> 08:17.765
- Any contact with Green and Taylor?
- Negative, sir.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.655
Those trucks are going on a supply run.

08:19.681 --> 08:21.582
They could be anywhere by now.

08:22.077 --> 08:24.313
As long as your friend hasn't
come back from the <i>Solace</i>

08:24.337 --> 08:26.288
and make you, my exfil plan could work...

08:26.313 --> 08:28.147
if we separate potus from the guards.

08:28.172 --> 08:31.186
We need to move fast, and
he may need some convincing.

08:31.558 --> 08:33.287
You were wrong about his body language.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.366
He's not a hostage.

08:34.392 --> 08:35.467
He's with them?

08:35.491 --> 08:37.267
There's layers in these groups.

08:37.292 --> 08:38.866
He may not know what the real agenda is.

08:38.892 --> 08:40.195
I don't know how deep in he is,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.395
but he has drunk some of the
kool-aid, that's for sure.

08:42.421 --> 08:43.595
Well, we gotta do this quietly.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.696
If he's here on his own
will, that means he has power.

08:45.721 --> 08:48.996
If he has power, he can be manipulated.

08:56.655 --> 08:58.322
There you are!

09:05.781 --> 09:07.215
The repeater's gone?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.959
Destroyed, like a pile of chum.

09:08.984 --> 09:09.884
It had to be that ship.

09:09.929 --> 09:11.397
We should alert the brothers.

09:11.503 --> 09:13.170
If we rise up with no sound matting,

09:13.205 --> 09:15.081
we might as well paint a bloody target

09:15.106 --> 09:16.343
on the side of our sub.

09:16.368 --> 09:17.757
It's gonna take days to fix the matting.

09:17.782 --> 09:19.429
We can't just sit down here
with our thumbs up our asses.

09:19.454 --> 09:20.546
Enough.

09:20.571 --> 09:23.973
We ain't heard from
that ship in hours, man.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.444
We gotta be far enough away.

09:25.469 --> 09:26.636
Just 'cause we ain't heard 'em

09:26.661 --> 09:27.976
don't mean they aren't out there.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.820
And that makes you the
blood expert, does it?

09:29.845 --> 09:32.250
Yes, you...

09:32.275 --> 09:34.175
Enough! Bloody hell!

09:34.200 --> 09:36.167
A bloke can't even think
with all this ruckus!

09:36.192 --> 09:39.072
Shut it! All of you! Shut it!

09:39.097 --> 09:41.256
You yellow-bellied, whiny wankers.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.600
I just...

09:42.634 --> 09:45.115
I need...

09:45.304 --> 09:46.938
To think.

09:56.469 --> 09:59.505
This machine is very impressive, Dr. Scott.

09:59.530 --> 10:02.358
Well, it's really thanks
to Commander Garnett

10:02.383 --> 10:04.356
and Lieutenant Chung.

10:04.381 --> 10:06.849
I've administered the virus

10:06.890 --> 10:10.185
to these four mice.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.478
And now...

10:12.799 --> 10:16.086
It's time to introduce them to the cure.

10:17.403 --> 10:21.406
And then... We wait.

10:28.111 --> 10:31.504
So all they have to do is breathe it in?

10:31.529 --> 10:34.330
Yes, all they have to do is breathe.

10:34.586 --> 10:37.554
It works very much like an inhaler.

10:41.105 --> 10:43.239
- Are you sure?
- It was him.

10:43.264 --> 10:45.365
He was experimenting on something.

10:45.390 --> 10:47.995
Jesus. I thought we smoked
that mofo on the <i> Vyerni.</i>

10:48.020 --> 10:49.333
Well, he's back from the dead.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.536
- Hey, Pompano!
- Hey!

10:50.561 --> 10:52.496
- Time to roll. Load up.
- Sweet.

10:53.761 --> 10:55.195
Where we goin'?

10:55.220 --> 10:57.689
A lot of people, a lot of mouths to feed.

11:00.099 --> 11:01.800
What's with the motorcade?

11:01.825 --> 11:03.993
I thought Sean wanted to keep this quiet.

11:04.018 --> 11:06.241
They don't know what you're up to, do they?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.633
They're here for the supply run.

11:07.658 --> 11:10.060
You're just a pit stop on the way.

11:10.085 --> 11:12.332
Get in.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.524
Thank you. Mr. president.

11:57.549 --> 11:58.783
Nice to meet you.

12:02.851 --> 12:05.636
That your bag, ma'am? Is that your bag?

12:05.661 --> 12:07.181
No.

12:07.679 --> 12:09.880
It's been sitting there
for about 20 minutes

12:09.914 --> 12:13.181
and I could swear I hear
beeping coming from inside.

12:13.206 --> 12:14.982
Beeping?

12:16.786 --> 12:20.422
Look, I don't wanna be paranoid,
but that's the president, right?

12:21.081 --> 12:23.082
I mean, should we say something?

12:25.252 --> 12:28.411
Bomb! There's a bomb in here!

12:31.807 --> 12:34.482
Oh, my God. The doors are locked!

12:34.507 --> 12:37.076
Hey! Get me out of
here! Get me out of here!

12:37.101 --> 12:38.957
Get me out of here!

12:38.982 --> 12:41.529
- Get out of my way!
- Get off of him!

12:41.554 --> 12:43.651
Sir, get down. Get down!

13:04.665 --> 13:06.639
Mr. President.

13:06.664 --> 13:08.709
- There was a bomb scare upstairs.
- What?

13:08.734 --> 13:11.059
It was just a knapsack. A woman panicked.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.876
- It was nothing.
- It was not nothing.

13:12.911 --> 13:14.867
I could've been trampled.

13:15.028 --> 13:18.667
Somebody in the crowd was able
to get up right in my face.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.999
If he hadn't stepped up
and fought the guy off,

13:21.024 --> 13:22.843
who knows what would've happened?

13:22.868 --> 13:25.340
He certainly could've got
a shot off or stabbed me.

13:25.365 --> 13:28.390
So you brought him up here?
What's he want? A trophy?

13:28.415 --> 13:30.650
Easy, James. Manners.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.298
Sean Ramsey.

13:34.332 --> 13:36.289
Course I know who you are.

13:36.314 --> 13:39.483
Well, thanks for your help. All right?

13:39.508 --> 13:42.409
No disrespect...

13:42.641 --> 13:44.898
But, uh, here in the U.S. of A,

13:44.923 --> 13:47.858
we use more than two guys
to guard the president.

13:49.177 --> 13:51.479
And we never leave his side.

14:00.937 --> 14:02.604
You're right.

14:02.629 --> 14:06.306
Giovanni, you're on potus
detail with these wankers.

14:06.331 --> 14:09.199
Make sure something like
this never happens again.

14:09.234 --> 14:13.616
No, I want him. I want an American.

14:21.712 --> 14:23.219
You got a name?

14:23.244 --> 14:24.677
Tommy.

14:24.816 --> 14:26.650
Where you from, Tommy?

14:26.684 --> 14:29.505
Worked as a bodyguard in New York.

14:29.530 --> 14:32.393
I was protecting one of those
teenage pop stars in Miami

14:32.418 --> 14:34.805
when the virus broke out.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.971
Next thing I know, people
are dropping like flies,

14:37.996 --> 14:40.397
but I'm still kicking.

14:40.431 --> 14:42.991
Wasn't till I met one of your boys that...

14:44.348 --> 14:46.890
I realized why.

14:49.775 --> 14:52.482
I was chosen.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.991
And your family?

15:07.677 --> 15:09.991
Wife didn't make it.

15:11.613 --> 15:13.147
So how'd you come to us, then?

15:13.172 --> 15:14.773
Just got in on a bus from down south.

15:14.798 --> 15:17.491
Must've ran into MacDowell then.

15:17.516 --> 15:20.190
I was never really good with names.

15:21.147 --> 15:23.816
Man was a good speaker, though.

15:33.918 --> 15:36.019
You said you were chosen.

15:41.538 --> 15:43.524
I know I was.

15:43.549 --> 15:46.651
So that must mean that this
is where you're supposed to be

15:46.676 --> 15:48.577
at this very moment?

15:48.602 --> 15:50.703
Well, I don't know about that.

15:52.673 --> 15:56.764
But if I were in the right
place at the right time,

15:57.179 --> 15:59.580
let the chips fall.

16:03.673 --> 16:06.141
The chips fall.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.349
Welcome to the team, brother.

16:28.548 --> 16:31.349
Tommy.

16:31.641 --> 16:34.626
You, stay close to him.

16:47.468 --> 16:49.536
You okay?

16:49.885 --> 16:52.086
He didn't have to break it.

16:52.118 --> 16:54.185
Don't be a baby.

16:56.020 --> 17:00.287
Captain hasn't left the
suite. Think he pulled it off.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.089
Any word on Michener's transport?

17:05.115 --> 17:09.050
Still on schedule, according to my source.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.230
You and that guard

17:12.263 --> 17:14.758
seem to be getting along pretty well.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.056
Ah!

17:40.259 --> 17:42.694
Don't get your hopes up.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.487
That was just an anesthetic.

17:46.588 --> 17:48.956
Niels. Can you believe that shit?

17:48.982 --> 17:50.850
How did he hook up with these assholes?

17:52.334 --> 17:53.768
What the hell do you think they're up to?

17:53.793 --> 17:55.058
I'm not sure.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.112
But whatever it is, he'll
be spreading the virus.

17:57.137 --> 17:58.704
You think he might recognize us?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.429
Nah, we saw him for
what? All of 20 seconds?

18:00.454 --> 18:01.597
And he was inside a bubble.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.691
Well, you're a lot less
recognizable than me

18:03.716 --> 18:05.308
if it comes to that.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.419
I'm just saying.

18:06.444 --> 18:09.128
I mean, you got that, um, vanilla thing.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.686
Look at me.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.122
Okay, whatever you say, Duck Dynasty.

18:13.147 --> 18:16.295
Yeah, I'm a distinctive man.

18:18.613 --> 18:21.842
Bloody hell. We've got a
bearing on that American ship.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.102
It's in firing range and getting closer.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.443
- They pinged us?
- No, not yet.

18:26.468 --> 18:28.348
- We ought to take the shot.
- When we can't move?

18:28.373 --> 18:29.841
We can move.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.342
Without our sound matting?

18:31.367 --> 18:33.557
We'll be as bright as a
friggin' firecracker to them.

18:33.582 --> 18:35.884
I say we take the first shot, right now.

18:36.099 --> 18:38.000
I like our chances.

18:38.025 --> 18:39.426
That's what Sean would want, anyway.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.219
That's what Ned would want.

18:41.253 --> 18:44.088
Course he don't mind the
idea of going to hell.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.423
I've got another mind about that.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.291
They're headed straight for our compound.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.827
I don't think that's an accident.

18:48.852 --> 18:50.719
Then take the bloody shot, then!

18:50.744 --> 18:52.526
Take it!

18:57.302 --> 18:59.748
Still 20 miles from the mouth of the river.

19:00.047 --> 19:01.448
Let's hope we make it by the time

19:01.473 --> 19:03.207
the boys call for the extraction.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.978
And what if that sub's parked
off the coast waiting for us?

19:07.012 --> 19:08.713
Cross that bridge when we come to it.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.816
I was thinking we should
move Dr. Scott somewhere safe,

19:11.850 --> 19:14.051
somewhere off the ship.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.054
She won't be any safer on land.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.958
You know what they did to
Dr. Hunter and all the labs.

19:20.983 --> 19:22.917
They got people on the
ground, Master Chief.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.962
Sounds like a whole lot of
them. All over the place.

19:27.183 --> 19:29.313
We're just one ship.

19:37.075 --> 19:40.011
"It is our responsibility as immunes

19:40.045 --> 19:42.380
"to restore this great nation.

19:42.414 --> 19:45.142
"And just as God chose
Noah to survive the flood

19:45.167 --> 19:46.901
"of the old testament,

19:46.926 --> 19:51.329
"he has chosen us to survive this plague

19:51.354 --> 19:54.390
that washed away the sins of our world."

19:54.415 --> 19:56.416
Yes.

19:57.972 --> 19:59.740
Do I sound convincing?

19:59.765 --> 20:01.132
Do you believe it?

20:01.166 --> 20:03.467
Why, yes. Of course,

20:03.502 --> 20:06.804
but I don't have Sean's charisma.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.739
I watched his videos.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.176
I've seen the translations
into Spanish, Bulgarian.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.878
You don't understand the language,

20:13.912 --> 20:15.346
but you believe what he's saying.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.081
Bulgaria?

20:17.115 --> 20:19.483
He has followers everywhere.

20:19.518 --> 20:22.954
I used to do "meet the
press" every once in a while,

20:22.988 --> 20:27.024
but getting in front of crowds like this...

20:27.059 --> 20:29.460
All right, now throw these two on the top.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.363
All right, two more cards.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.532
Sir...

20:34.566 --> 20:36.767
I hope I'm not out of line,

20:36.802 --> 20:39.870
but you look tired.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.506
Some fresh air might be good for you.

20:43.964 --> 20:45.993
I'm sure we could clear the
courtyard of the volunteers

20:46.018 --> 20:47.883
so you won't have to worry
about getting mobbed again,

20:47.908 --> 20:49.642
right, fellas?

20:49.667 --> 20:51.976
If that's what he wants.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.984
Right.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.988
Excuse me.

21:22.047 --> 21:24.048
Hmm.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.050
What's all these?

21:26.084 --> 21:27.385
What do you mean?

21:27.419 --> 21:29.320
This is all that I've made.

21:29.354 --> 21:32.056
We're going to find more survivors, no?

21:32.090 --> 21:34.842
No, no, no, no, no, you do one a day.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.571
And if that works, then we
can talk about doing more.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.715
- Well, that's not what Sean said.
- Well, Sean ain't here.

21:44.549 --> 21:46.683
Okay, fine, it's not what Sean said,

21:46.708 --> 21:49.143
but...  All right.

21:49.168 --> 21:50.716
So remember,

21:50.741 --> 21:57.116
the gel, it soaks the fur so
as long as the bear is wet,

21:57.141 --> 21:58.575
it's contagious.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.103
So really encourage the
child to squeeze the bear.

22:02.128 --> 22:03.416
What the hell?

22:03.441 --> 22:05.475
I'm not doing your dirty work for ya.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.968
Then I can't do it.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.402
I mean, if I breathe on them,
they'll get the virus anyway.

22:09.427 --> 22:10.965
It's not a controlled experiment.

22:10.989 --> 22:12.963
We need to see if the bear works.

22:13.521 --> 22:16.564
I need a volunteer.

22:16.589 --> 22:18.963
Who likes kids?

22:19.258 --> 22:22.894
Yeah, I'll go. I'll do it.

22:22.919 --> 22:24.364
Give it to him.

22:24.389 --> 22:26.164
What can I do for you, sir?

22:26.189 --> 22:28.090
See that trailer park over there?

22:28.382 --> 22:33.064
Go and, uh, go and hand
it out to one of the kids.

22:35.423 --> 22:38.035
It, uh, squeaks.

22:38.060 --> 22:39.336
Kids enjoy that.

22:39.361 --> 22:42.273
Yeah, it's our way of making...
Friends in the community.

22:42.298 --> 22:43.695
You know, they may not be immune,

22:43.720 --> 22:45.621
but, uh, we got to be good neighbors.

22:45.814 --> 22:49.211
And, uh, you know, people are
a bit skittish of strangers.

22:49.236 --> 22:52.205
So this will, uh, this will loosen 'em up.

22:52.230 --> 22:55.019
Yeah, sure.

22:55.955 --> 22:58.710
Jimmy, take Willie and go back him up.

23:19.451 --> 23:22.920
I don't understand.
The machine didn't work?

23:22.964 --> 23:26.333
No, the machine is not the problem.

23:26.368 --> 23:28.092
The mice closest to the porthole

23:28.117 --> 23:29.891
were able to inhale
the vaccine immediately.

23:29.916 --> 23:31.924
So by the time the powder made its way

23:31.949 --> 23:35.585
to the second chamber,
must've lost its potency.

23:35.610 --> 23:38.512
Imagine dropping it from 300 feet.

23:38.546 --> 23:41.022
We'll be lucky if anyone
catches the therapeutic dose.

23:41.047 --> 23:42.281
It'll be completely inactive

23:42.306 --> 23:45.122
by the time it reaches the ground.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.952
So what do we do?

23:51.464 --> 23:54.666
I don't know yet.

24:08.594 --> 24:11.269
Let's go, everybody! Over here. Over here.

24:29.754 --> 24:31.288
Sir?

24:31.313 --> 24:33.632
We're all set.

24:58.563 --> 25:00.331
Well, it doesn't look like anyone's here.

25:00.356 --> 25:02.557
I guess we should head back.

25:02.582 --> 25:04.549
That's Sean's little brother.

25:04.574 --> 25:06.475
We do what he says.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.863
Keep lookin'.

25:30.784 --> 25:33.652
Help you with something?

25:34.132 --> 25:36.386
I feel like we've met.

25:36.411 --> 25:38.785
Not unless you've been to Reno.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.823
No. I don't know...

25:41.848 --> 25:44.305
- Go ahead.
- Where is this Reno, but...

25:44.985 --> 25:46.753
We've met before.

25:49.906 --> 25:51.475
You're creeping me out, man.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.635
Ah.

25:59.418 --> 26:01.285
This is Cobra.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.411
I've got eyes on C.O.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.298
He's with three other
men. Not sure who they are.

26:06.323 --> 26:07.569
But they're on the move.

26:07.594 --> 26:11.052
How soon until you can
launch still 6 miles out, sir.

26:12.219 --> 26:14.487
I don't see anyone. You?

26:24.351 --> 26:25.952
What are you waiting for?

26:27.940 --> 26:30.308
Maybe you guys should stay back.

26:30.367 --> 26:33.135
We don't wanna scare her.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.379
- All right.
- Okay.

26:52.583 --> 26:55.285
The <i> Vyerni.</i> Yeah, that's it.

26:55.310 --> 26:57.873
You know, I think Ned
and his brother would be

26:57.914 --> 27:00.576
very interested to find
out who you really are, huh?

27:00.601 --> 27:03.176
Does he know who you are?

27:04.618 --> 27:07.192
I bet his people won't
be very happy to find out

27:07.217 --> 27:09.475
that their whole belief
system's just a sham,

27:09.500 --> 27:11.935
that they ain't chosen,
and you're just the lab rat

27:11.960 --> 27:13.936
that started all this.

27:14.221 --> 27:15.896
- They need me.
- Yeah?

27:15.921 --> 27:17.032
Yeah.

27:17.057 --> 27:20.259
More than they need to
believe their own story?

27:21.943 --> 27:24.544
Hi there.

27:25.423 --> 27:27.591
My name is Danny.

27:29.378 --> 27:31.012
What's your name?

27:31.351 --> 27:32.952
Laura.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.788
Hi, Laura. What's that?

27:35.813 --> 27:37.981
No, no, don't come any closer.

27:39.644 --> 27:42.312
I need you to turn around and
run away as fast as you can.

27:42.337 --> 27:44.997
- Why?
- Doesn't matter. Just go.

27:45.022 --> 27:46.957
Go!

27:46.982 --> 27:48.857
Hey!

27:50.297 --> 27:52.665
Okay, hold, hold... whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:52.690 --> 27:54.391
The virus is all over this thing!

27:54.416 --> 27:56.969
That scientist is trying
to poison innocent people

27:56.994 --> 27:59.262
- to weed out immunes.
- We got our orders, friend.

27:59.287 --> 28:00.274
Look, you see this?

28:00.299 --> 28:02.063
Huh? You see this?

28:02.088 --> 28:04.456
What do you think this is?
What do you think that is?!

28:04.481 --> 28:06.281
- What is that?
- Believe me,

28:06.306 --> 28:08.741
these people are not
who they pretend to be.

28:08.766 --> 28:10.533
Now put down your guns, save yourselves,

28:10.558 --> 28:12.821
- and get outta here!
- Sorry, we can't do that, man.

28:12.846 --> 28:14.747
I suggest you stop talking.

28:14.772 --> 28:17.521
You're making a mistake.

28:23.267 --> 28:25.657
- What was that?
- Uhh! Aah!

28:25.682 --> 28:28.050
He's not one of us! Hold up! Hold up!

28:28.075 --> 28:30.944
He's from the ship! He's
from the <i> Nathan James!</i>

28:30.969 --> 28:33.624
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Aah!

28:33.649 --> 28:37.285
No! No, no, no! No.

28:37.575 --> 28:38.742
Uhh!

28:38.767 --> 28:39.967
Get in!

28:41.217 --> 28:43.831
- Help. I'm hit.
- Uhh!

29:00.268 --> 29:01.681
Get in!

29:02.620 --> 29:04.681
I got him! I dropped that scumbag!

29:18.596 --> 29:20.464
Starting our ascent to radio depth.

29:20.489 --> 29:22.457
Verify sonar with flight control.

29:23.447 --> 29:25.321
If you see anything, we dive immediately.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.646
Aye.

29:28.504 --> 29:30.824
Sir? We're picking up something on sonar.

29:30.849 --> 29:32.414
3 nautical miles away,
close to the surface.

29:32.439 --> 29:33.314
This one's moving.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.713
That has to be our sub.

29:34.738 --> 29:37.727
Set quiet two and EMCON.
Alert Tiger and Cobra.

29:38.952 --> 29:41.258
Bridge, it's the X.O.
Reduce speed to 4 knots.

29:41.283 --> 29:42.266
Can't risk a fight now.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.368
We've gotta get our people out of there.

29:43.392 --> 29:45.071
I've got a bearing of 1-7-0.

29:45.096 --> 29:46.719
Make ready ASROCs and stand by.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.408
Sir?

29:48.433 --> 29:50.619
If they fire, we fire back.

29:58.705 --> 30:00.873
This is Tiger Team standing by rally point.

30:00.898 --> 30:02.485
Requesting immediate extract.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.985
Tiger? Cobra.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.211
Ship's at EMCON.

30:05.236 --> 30:09.686
Roger that. Any signs of the captain?

30:27.066 --> 30:29.662
Stop! You!

30:31.772 --> 30:34.039
Where are you going?

30:34.848 --> 30:36.382
What's the problem?

30:36.407 --> 30:38.544
Mr. President, we need you to come with us.

30:38.569 --> 30:40.701
- What the hell's going on?
- We're under attack.

30:40.724 --> 30:42.590
Some of our guys were
picked off at the drop site.

30:42.615 --> 30:44.464
We have orders to evacuate the president.

30:44.489 --> 30:47.020
Get him back to the sub. Now!

30:48.910 --> 30:50.877
Wait!

30:51.185 --> 30:53.553
We go out that way, he'll be mobbed.

30:53.578 --> 30:55.721
We need to take him out back.

30:57.104 --> 30:59.921
Andiamo. Andiamo. Vai!

31:03.373 --> 31:06.221
- Secure the compound!
- Lock it up! Go, go, go!

31:06.246 --> 31:08.581
- Go, go! You heard him!
- Come on!

31:14.747 --> 31:17.701
Hey! Hey, what's this alarm?

31:17.726 --> 31:19.260
Maybe they made the captain.

31:19.285 --> 31:20.675
The courtyard's blown.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.175
There's half a dozen commandos out there.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.574
We gotta get to the kitchen. Come on.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.763
We need our helo in the air.
Sir, we cannot launch the helo

31:28.788 --> 31:30.450
until we are into the mouth of the harbor.

31:30.475 --> 31:32.301
How much further? Half a mile, sir.

31:32.326 --> 31:35.754
At reduced speed, we're
still seven minutes away.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.255
Seal the exits!

31:40.532 --> 31:42.884
There are people from that
bloody ship inside here!

31:42.909 --> 31:44.710
No one leaves this compound, you hear me?

31:44.735 --> 31:46.635
I've got it, I've got it!

31:46.660 --> 31:50.010
No one leaves! Stay inside!
No one leaves this compound!

32:04.909 --> 32:06.909
Move it! Move it!

32:06.934 --> 32:08.735
Okay, you two, left!

33:19.577 --> 33:22.070
Uhh!

33:25.918 --> 33:28.670
Aah! Ahh!

33:28.695 --> 33:31.070
Aah! Aah!

33:31.095 --> 33:33.863
Ah! Ahh! Aah! Aah!

33:44.094 --> 33:46.095
Uhh! Aah!

33:54.646 --> 33:57.681
Exfil point is blown. We can't go out back.

33:57.707 --> 33:58.974
Who are you?

33:58.999 --> 34:01.421
Mr. President, we don't have much time.

34:01.446 --> 34:04.007
I'm Commander Tom Chandler.
We're the United States Navy.

34:04.032 --> 34:06.103
Sean Ramsey is not who you think he is.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.405
He's a terrorist threatening this country.

34:07.430 --> 34:09.483
- We got to get you out of here right now.
- Ah.

34:09.507 --> 34:10.858
Sir!

34:11.974 --> 34:14.042
With all due respect...

34:15.420 --> 34:17.855
Let's move.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.795
Quarter mile, sir.

34:29.998 --> 34:32.199
5 meters...

34:32.380 --> 34:34.634
3 meters...

34:34.967 --> 34:36.969
2...

34:37.513 --> 34:40.034
On radio depth.

34:44.670 --> 34:46.368
- Stop!
- What are you doing here?

34:46.393 --> 34:49.040
No! Uhh!

34:57.576 --> 34:59.073
Set.

35:01.729 --> 35:04.177
We've got the sub!

35:04.445 --> 35:06.547
Ian, where the hell have you been?

35:06.572 --> 35:08.373
That ship blew up our repeater.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.775
We've got 'em in our sight.

35:12.528 --> 35:13.764
Stop them!

35:15.815 --> 35:18.594
Ian, fire! Blow that ship out of the water!

35:18.619 --> 35:20.368
- Go active sonar!
- Aye.

35:26.741 --> 35:27.908
Uhh!

35:27.933 --> 35:30.715
Aah!

35:41.613 --> 35:45.289
Tiger, Cobra! This is Vulture!
What's the extraction point?

35:45.314 --> 35:47.048
I say again, what is the extraction point?

35:47.073 --> 35:48.828
We got Vulture Team, sir!

35:48.853 --> 35:50.969
Rally point's at the
baseball field a half a mile

35:50.994 --> 35:52.864
North-northeast your whiskey.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.065
See you in five.

35:54.090 --> 35:56.047
- Gator?
- Almost there.

35:56.072 --> 35:59.227
Sir, we're being pinged.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.100
ASROCs armed and ready, sir.

36:03.985 --> 36:07.264
30 seconds till target.
Weapons locked and loaded, mate.

36:07.289 --> 36:09.918
Prepare to fire!

36:09.944 --> 36:12.846
Are we clear?

36:12.871 --> 36:14.399
Gator!

36:14.424 --> 36:15.424
300 yards, sir.

36:23.563 --> 36:25.564
10 seconds to lock on.

36:25.589 --> 36:28.498
200.

36:40.509 --> 36:42.282
Gator!

36:44.156 --> 36:47.686
Clear, sir!

36:48.320 --> 36:49.749
I've lost 'em.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.709
Lost 'em?!

36:51.734 --> 36:53.780
How the bloody hell did you lose 'em?!

36:53.805 --> 36:56.154
Get up! Move! Move!

36:56.179 --> 36:57.413
Put the helo in the air.

36:57.438 --> 36:59.905
ASTAC T.A.O. launch the helo.

37:08.905 --> 37:11.288
- Help. I'm bleeding.
- Apply pressure, dipshit.

37:15.271 --> 37:17.889
- Aah!
- I'll cut your heart out, you piece of shit!

37:17.914 --> 37:19.092
I'm dying. I'm dying.

37:19.117 --> 37:21.061
Hey, don't kill him. He could be useful.

37:21.359 --> 37:23.389
Here comes Vulture.

37:27.917 --> 37:30.449
- Where's our ride?
- Unclear. Ship's at EMCON.

37:30.474 --> 37:32.574
Where the hell did you find him?

37:32.599 --> 37:35.183
- Helo's inbound.
- Secure L.Z. perimeter.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.731
Let's move!

37:38.052 --> 37:41.330
Come on. Come on, you dirtbag.

37:46.035 --> 37:48.536
Green, what are you doing?

37:48.561 --> 37:49.895
Green! Move it!

37:51.798 --> 37:52.964
Come on! Move it! Move it!

38:09.062 --> 38:11.145
We got company!

38:22.710 --> 38:25.265
Get in, dirtbag.

38:29.650 --> 38:31.984
Come on!

38:34.883 --> 38:36.330
Set!

38:51.750 --> 38:55.392
Thought you and Dr. Scott might
wanna have a chat with him!

38:55.417 --> 38:57.452
Who's that?!

38:57.477 --> 39:00.119
Jeffrey Michener, Commander in Chief!

39:00.144 --> 39:01.721
Come again, boss?!

39:01.745 --> 39:04.259
He's the president of the United States!

39:25.513 --> 39:27.603
They're taking Niels to the medical bay.

39:27.628 --> 39:31.504
Doc Rios says it's gonna be a touch and go.

39:31.922 --> 39:33.488
And the infected toys,

39:33.513 --> 39:35.260
are you sure you destroyed them all?

39:35.285 --> 39:37.661
Yes, sir.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.043
All but one.

39:49.552 --> 39:51.152
What's this?

39:51.177 --> 39:53.516
I think you better sit down.

39:55.829 --> 39:58.597
No, no, no, no, no!

39:58.622 --> 40:00.889
How the hell could this happen?

40:04.162 --> 40:05.689
You lost Niels...

40:05.714 --> 40:07.750
Uhh!

40:07.775 --> 40:10.679
You lost your president...

40:11.759 --> 40:14.666
You almost lost me, brother.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.103
And for what?

40:19.163 --> 40:21.297
For this stinking country

40:21.322 --> 40:25.658
with its filthy, ungrateful buggers.

40:26.079 --> 40:28.673
If we don't attack now,

40:28.863 --> 40:31.895
that bloody ship is gonna
kill every last one of us...

40:31.920 --> 40:34.255
you, me...

40:34.386 --> 40:36.994
Every man on our sub.

40:37.595 --> 40:40.297
Now what are you gonna do about it?

40:47.872 --> 40:51.094
They're organized, Mike,
much more than you'd imagine.

40:51.504 --> 40:54.706
Our country's been without
a leader for months now.

40:54.731 --> 40:57.132
It was only a matter of time
before somebody like Ramsey

40:57.157 --> 40:58.691
to come along and try to take power.

40:58.716 --> 41:00.265
He's got something.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.540
These people believe what he's selling.

41:02.565 --> 41:04.232
- You can't do this to me!
- You can't...

41:04.257 --> 41:06.405
you have no right to
do this to me. No right!

41:06.430 --> 41:08.310
You hear me?!

41:08.765 --> 41:11.538
Well, our commander in
chief doesn't seem too happy

41:11.563 --> 41:12.694
to be with us, does he?

41:12.719 --> 41:15.249
Well, that's something
we're gonna have to change.

41:15.481 --> 41:20.368
Won't be easy... If he
really is one of them.

41:20.393 --> 41:22.655
This country needs a leader almost as much

41:22.680 --> 41:23.893
as it needs the cure.

41:23.918 --> 41:25.786
Ramsey was gonna use the president

41:25.811 --> 41:28.345
to win the hearts and minds of America.

41:33.740 --> 41:36.976
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
