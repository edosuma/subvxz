<i>ELIJAH: Over the course
of my long life...</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:08.817
<i>...I have come to believe that we are bound
forever to those with whom we share blood.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.421
<i>And while we may not choose our family...</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:13.920
<i>...that bond can be
our greatest strength...</i>

00:14.815 --> 00:16.726
<i>...or our deepest regret.</i>

00:17.918 --> 00:20.990
<i>This unfortunate truth has haunted me
for as long as I can recall.</i>

00:26.260 --> 00:27.830
What do you make of that?

00:28.929 --> 00:30.203
No banner, no flag.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.167
Floated in out of nowhere.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.938
A miracle ship.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.272
Why is it just sitting out there?

00:39.339 --> 00:41.012
I suppose we ought to find out.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.195
Where in hell is everyone?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.229
Deserted.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.602
Which makes everything
in the hold legally forfeit.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.069
Take what suits you.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.777
What do you make that?

01:11.038 --> 01:12.108
Open it up.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.823
What the hell?

01:40.734 --> 01:41.940
REBEKAH: Hello.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.516
Hm...

01:46.740 --> 01:48.583
Lovely to see
such a handsome face

01:48.742 --> 01:50.085
after a long journey.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.517
Can I eat him, brother?

01:51.845 --> 01:53.483
ELIJAH: I'd rather you didn't.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.486
There's no need to be afraid.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.859
You'll do exactly as I say.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.129
You'll remember nothing.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.835
I will remember nothing.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.533
We have had a very
long journey,

02:07.694 --> 02:08.832
wherein which,
unfortunately,

02:08.996 --> 02:09.997
we lost all of our crew.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.370
Therefore, I would ask you
to kindly transport

02:12.532 --> 02:14.034
our belongings
to the shore.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.536
What kind
of hell demons are you?

02:16.703 --> 02:18.046
REBEKAH: We're vampires, darling.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.146
The Original vampires.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.452
Rebekah, Elijah.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.390
Our brothers, Kol and Finn,
may they rest in peace.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.951
KLAUS: Are we saving
the best for last?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.124
And our half-brother Niklaus.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.893
Ignore him.
He's a beast.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.792
(LAUGHS)

02:38.825 --> 02:39.803
(BODY THUDS)

02:40.394 --> 02:42.874
We fled Europe and
survived the seas.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.737
Would you rather
I arrive hungry

02:44.898 --> 02:46.536
on the shores
of our new homeland?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.379
Niklaus, your manners are,
as always, without equal.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.584
Sir, would you be so
good as to tell us

02:53.740 --> 02:55.515
where it is that
we have landed?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.253
The French colony
of Louisiana.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.415
Off the shores of a town
they've named New Orleans.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.522
Well, thank you so much.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.425
Oh, I do recommend
that you find yourself

03:07.587 --> 03:09.260
further assistance
for the luggage.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.334
My sincere apologies.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.102
CAMI: So, what brings you
to the Big Easy?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.468
I used to live here.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.204
Really? When?

03:48.528 --> 03:50.132
Oh, feels like
a hundred years ago.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.640
I just moved here myself.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.799
What brought you back?

03:52.966 --> 03:54.309
Well, my brother
is here somewhere.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.276
I'm afraid he might have gotten himself
into a bit of a bind.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.246
You say that like it's
a common occurrence.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.749
Well, he's complicated...

04:02.275 --> 04:06.417
Defiant. Ill-mannered.
And a little temperamental.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.420
See, we don't share
the same father.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.655
Of course,
that never bothered me,

04:12.819 --> 04:14.992
but my brother
resents it deeply.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.827
Never felt
like he belonged.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.994
All told, he has
a long history

04:19.159 --> 04:20.661
of getting himself
into trouble.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.135
And I'm guessing
you have a long history

04:22.295 --> 04:23.330
of getting him
out of it.

04:24.397 --> 04:25.933
What kind of bind
is your brother in?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.601
He believes there are
people in this town

04:27.768 --> 04:29.179
that are conspiring
against him.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.339
Wow.
Narcissistic and paranoid.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.584
Sorry. Bartender with a grad degree
in psychology.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.017
Total clichÃ©.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.147
Listen, Camille.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.759
I'm looking for someone
who might shed some light

04:42.916 --> 04:44.259
on his current
predicament.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.192
She works here.
Jane-Anne Deveraux.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.855
Any idea where
I might find her?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.331
No, but I know
someone who might.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.527
Welcome to New Orleans,

04:52.759 --> 04:54.864
in the crown jewel
of the Crescent City,

04:55.162 --> 04:56.368
the French Quarter.

04:56.763 --> 05:00.040
Jazz and jambalaya,
romance and poetry,

05:00.433 --> 05:03.710
not to mention things
that go bump in the night.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.383
Monsters that feed
off human blood.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.649
Vengeful spirits
of the dead.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.224
And my personal favorite,
the witches.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.158
Here we have the voodoo shop
Jardin Gris.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
Go in,
browse for a hex.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.197
Are you gonna continue
following me, Elijah...

05:23.790 --> 05:24.996
...or do you want to talk?

05:25.292 --> 05:26.532
You know who I am.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.002
Original vampire,
always wears a suit.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.569
You and your family are
famous amongst the witches.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.309
Especially with
your brother back in town.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.913
Well, Niklaus is here
because he learned

05:37.070 --> 05:38.811
that a witch was
conspiring against him,

05:38.972 --> 05:40.918
someone by the name
of Jane-Anne Deveraux.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.210
Well, if he's looking for Jane-Anne,
he's a little late.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.989
Are you telling me she's dead?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.097
Come on.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.424
Her sister Sophie is gonna
wanna talk to you.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.630
That's Jane-Anne?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.861
Killed in public
for anyone to find.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.265
Only people come 'round here
are the witches.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.603
Now her sister has come
to take her body.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.642
Her spirit can't rest
until it's been

06:39.799 --> 06:41.472
properly interred
in the cemetery.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.718
Please tell me that my brother
had nothing to do with this.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.479
No. Jane-Anne died because
she got caught doing magic.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.820
What do you mean,
she got caught doing magic?

06:52.946 --> 06:53.924
(MAN WHISTLES)

06:56.449 --> 06:57.985
You want to know
who killed Jane-Anne?

06:58.151 --> 07:00.324
You're about to get your first glimpse
of Marcel in action.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.557
The vampire Marcel?

07:01.721 --> 07:05.066
Things have changed since your family
left town, and Marcel has changed.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.409
I'm asking you,
stay hidden.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.506
If Marcel finds out that a witch
lured the Originals back into town,

07:15.669 --> 07:17.012
my people will be
slaughtered.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.318
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

07:23.243 --> 07:24.950
I got to tell you, Soph,
this street corner

07:25.111 --> 07:27.921
is not proving the luckiest spot
for your family tonight.

07:28.114 --> 07:28.922
(GROWLING)

07:31.017 --> 07:32.496
Not half an hour ago,
we had to teach

07:32.652 --> 07:33.926
your sister
a little lesson.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.856
We're putting her
to rest, Marcel.

07:36.356 --> 07:37.926
Leave us alone.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.603
I never said you
could move the body.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.770
Matter of fact,
I left her here for a reason.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.642
Send a message.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.376
If anybody is thinking
of joining some kind of rebellion,

07:48.535 --> 07:52.278
my rules state that witches
can't practice magic in the Quarter,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.884
and yet a little birdie
informed me

07:55.041 --> 07:56.543
that Jane-Anne
was cooking up

07:56.710 --> 07:58.553
something magically
delicious.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.186
Oh, yeah,

08:01.348 --> 08:03.453
while I have you,
quick Q and A.

08:03.616 --> 08:06.062
My old friend,
the hybrid, Klaus,

08:06.219 --> 08:07.994
he just happened to
show up out of the blue.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.896
Asking for, of
all people, Jane-Anne.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.629
Any idea why?

08:13.293 --> 08:14.567
I don't know.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.234
Witches don't get involved
in vampire business.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.342
Hm.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.533
That would be pretty stupid...

08:21.067 --> 08:22.410
...that's for sure.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.914
Tell you what.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.409
Go back to the restaurant.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.815
Cook up some
of that famous gumbo.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.421
Keep those tourists happy.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.719
- Take the body.
- What?!

08:34.014 --> 08:36.392
No. Stop. Stop. Marcel!

08:36.549 --> 08:38.323
MARCEL: I'm gonna hold on
to your sister's body,

08:38.485 --> 08:40.726
in case maybe you remember
why Klaus is here.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.491
SOPHIE: Marcel, please.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.929
Her body won't be at peace.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.092
Not my problem.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.439
You mean to tell me,
after all these years,

08:50.597 --> 08:52.838
- Marcel is alive and well?
- Quite.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.706
Our brother seems to have
wandered into a war zone,

08:54.868 --> 08:56.279
<i>and I haven't been
able to find him.</i>

08:56.436 --> 08:58.677
<i>Marcel, who Klaus sired
and brought up</i>

08:58.838 --> 09:00.613
<i>beneath his own wing,
now rules a menagerie</i>

09:00.774 --> 09:02.913
of savage vampires
running wild,

09:03.076 --> 09:04.953
killing in public for
any human to come upon.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.715
Witches are held
in subjugation.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.257
<i>I doubt Niklaus
had any idea</i>

09:08.415 --> 09:09.792
<i>what he was
walking into.</i>

09:09.949 --> 09:11.053
Sorry.
What was that?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.260
I stopped paying attention
at "our brother."

09:13.420 --> 09:14.421
Rebekah.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.794
Our hateful, traitorous bastard
of a brother,

09:16.956 --> 09:18.264
<i>who's negated
any sympathy</i>

09:18.425 --> 09:19.927
I once had for him
by his repeated efforts

09:20.093 --> 09:21.766
to ensure neither you
nor I know happiness

09:21.928 --> 09:23.737
outside of his own
selfish universe.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.465
Always and forever, Rebekah.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.475
That is what we once
swore to each other.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.304
Consider this me
calling take-backs.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.310
Oh, you've called take-backs dozens
of times over the centuries.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.214
<i>And yet when our father found us
and chased us from this very city--</i>

09:35.375 --> 09:37.912
I may be old, Elijah,
but I'm hardly senile.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.785
<i>I know very we]!
I stuck with Klaus.</i>

09:39.946 --> 09:41.755
And not three years later
he stuck a silver dagger

09:41.915 --> 09:44.418
in my chest and sent me into
a magical slumber for 90 years.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.585
Do you know why?

09:45.752 --> 09:46.992
Because I had
the audacity to try

09:47.153 --> 09:49.258
and live my life
on my own without him.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.502
No. I believe our brother
is in trouble.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.663
<i>So whatever is going on
between Marcel and the witches,</i>

09:53.827 --> 09:55.067
<i>it's dire enough that
they'd risk</i>

09:55.228 --> 09:56.673
<i>bringing an Original
back to town.</i>

09:56.830 --> 09:58.138
The witches
have lured him here.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.333
I'd like to know why.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.294
You got me into this, Jane.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.670
Give me the strength
to finish it.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.502
(DOOR SLAMS)

10:45.645 --> 10:46.953
The doors work,
you know.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.823
You're doing magic?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.685
I'm praying
to my dead sister.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.694
Go ahead.
Pay your respects.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.291
Ah! Don't make this
a thing, Sophie.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.299
The Hybrid was looking
for Jane-Anne.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.869
Marcel wants to know why.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.870
I'd say ask her yourself,
but I guess you can't,

11:03.029 --> 11:04.565
seeing as Marcel killed her.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.509
-(GROWLING)
- Ah!

11:21.247 --> 11:22.225
(GRUNTING)

11:27.987 --> 11:29.489
I'm Elijah.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.600
Have you
heard of me?

11:33.493 --> 11:34.836
Yes.

11:35.995 --> 11:36.996
So why don't you tell me

11:37.163 --> 11:39.268
what business your family has
with my brother?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.558
This is sacred ground,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.593
which means vampires
have to be invited in.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.100
But since I'm desperate,
come on in.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.397
We can talk freely here.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.902
Then I suggest
you start talking.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.274
What did your sister
want with Niklaus?

12:15.101 --> 12:16.102
Isn't it obvious?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.579
We have a vampire problem,
and we need help.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.077
Marcel has an army
backing him.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.084
The witches have been
trying to fight back.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.551
We haven't had
much luck

12:24.711 --> 12:26.713
until my sister
Jane-Anne met a girl.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.323
A werewolf passing
through the Quarter

12:29.482 --> 12:31.120
from a small town
in Virginia.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.392
She had a special
connection to your brother.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.827
What kind
of connection?

12:37.056 --> 12:40.162
Apparently, they spent
some time together.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.634
One thing led
to another,

12:41.794 --> 12:44.240
and now this special
werewolf girl,

12:44.397 --> 12:46.502
she's pregnant,
and the father

12:46.666 --> 12:48.168
of the child
she's carrying

12:48.334 --> 12:49.836
is your brother, Klaus.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.680
It's impossible.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.514
Nothing is impossible,

12:53.840 --> 12:55.911
especially not when it comes
to your brother.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.685
Think about it.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.290
They call him
the Hybrid, right?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.192
Bring her out.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.450
(GATE CREAKING)

13:19.265 --> 13:20.642
Who the hell are you?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.279
Give us a moment, please.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.559
So, have they been holding you here
against your will?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.564
They lured me out to the bayou
and grabbed me.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.892
Then they did all these
weird, witchy tests.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.729
Not that I understand
how this could happen.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.704
I mean,
vampires are dead.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.569
They can't have children.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.336
Perhaps if you knew
my brother's story,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.070
it might explain
how this is possible.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.406
Here.
If I may.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.072
What are you doing?

13:59.238 --> 14:00.581
Relax.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.081
If you open
your mind to me...

14:04.844 --> 14:06.084
...I can show you.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.426
In the beginning,
our family was human.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.094
<i>A thousand years ago now.</i>

14:17.323 --> 14:19.360
Come on, Henry, our brothers
are fighting again.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.866
<i>ELIJAH: Although our mother
dabbled in the dark arts,</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:23.598
<i>we were largely just</i> a <i>family
trying to survive</i>

14:23.763 --> 14:26.243
<i>at a time when it was quite
difficult to do so.</i>

14:27.867 --> 14:31.440
<i>And, for better or worse,
we were happy.</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:34.585
That is, however,
until one night

14:34.741 --> 14:36.220
our youngest brother
was killed

14:36.376 --> 14:38.287
by our village's greatest threat.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.918
Brother!

14:41.514 --> 14:45.121
Men that could transform themselves
into wolves during the full moon.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.792
Our family was devastated.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.732
<i>None more than Niklaus.</i>

14:51.391 --> 14:53.064
Desperate to protect
the rest of us,

14:53.226 --> 14:55.103
our father forced
our mother to call

14:55.261 --> 14:57.798
upon her black magic
in order to make us stronger.

14:58.865 --> 14:59.969
Drink!

15:00.967 --> 15:02.275
Drink!

15:03.636 --> 15:05.582
Thus, the first
vampires were born.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.450
But with this speed,
this strength,

15:08.608 --> 15:12.420
this immortality
came a terrible hunger.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.924
No one felt this hunger
more than Niklaus.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.628
When he killed for the first time,

15:22.789 --> 15:24.427
we knew what he truly was.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.904
(SCREAMING)

15:29.095 --> 15:30.335
Niklaus!

15:31.330 --> 15:33.003
What is happening to me?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.772
No, don't! Don't!

15:36.903 --> 15:39.281
Father! It hurts!

15:39.472 --> 15:41.918
(SCREAMING)

15:45.111 --> 15:47.751
He's a beast.
An abomination.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.989
He wasn't just a vampire.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.861
He was also a werewolf.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.864
That's how the werewolf
curse works.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.269
It isn't activated
until you take a life.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.034
Niklaus was the result
of an indiscretion

16:06.199 --> 16:07.803
our mother had hidden
from us all.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.545
An affair with
a werewolf like yourself.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.881
<i>Infuriated by this betrayal,</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:15.849
<i>my father forced our mother
to cast a spell that would</i>

16:16.008 --> 16:18.887
<i>suppress Klaus' werewolf side,
denying him any connection</i>

16:19.045 --> 16:20.456
<i>with his true self.</i>

16:22.448 --> 16:25.224
Elijah, Elijah.
Hold him down.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.228
Brother!
Please don't let them do this to me.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.800
Do it now, boy! Now!

16:35.895 --> 16:37.067
Help me.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.042
Your dad was a dick.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.873
(CHUCKLES)

16:43.369 --> 16:45.679
I'm Hayley,
by the way.

16:47.573 --> 16:48.643
You should probably
know my name

16:48.808 --> 16:50.845
if you're gonna tell me
your whole life story.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.588
I mean, I know yours.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.520
Your family is legendary.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.886
Your brother is
a notorious psycho,

16:58.050 --> 17:01.054
who I slept with.
Classic me.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.533
I cannot excuse his behavior,

17:03.689 --> 17:05.828
but you must understand

17:05.992 --> 17:07.596
that our father hunted him,

17:07.760 --> 17:09.535
hunted us for centuries.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.435
Every time we found
a moment of happiness,

17:11.597 --> 17:14.042
we were forced to flee,
even here in New Orleans,

17:14.200 --> 17:15.906
where we were happiest of all.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.613
Not long after
Niklaus broke the spell

17:18.771 --> 17:21.047
which prevented him
from becoming the Hybrid...

17:22.040 --> 17:23.281
...he defeated our father.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.550
I thought this
would make him happy.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.452
He was angrier than ever.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.187
I wonder if, perhaps,
this baby

17:32.351 --> 17:35.628
might be a way
for my brother to find happiness.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.632
A way to save him from himself.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.739
I'm glad you feel that way.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.799
Because we need your help.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.804
What, precisely,
is it that you want,

17:46.966 --> 17:48.570
and what does it have to do
with this young woman?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.146
We want to run Marcel
and his vampires out of town.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.577
Klaus is the key.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.548
Everything Marcel knows
about being a vampire,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.153
he learned from Klaus.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.756
Marcel trusts him.
Looks up to him.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.991
He won't see the betrayal coming.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.593
Yes. Well, as I'm sure
you're aware,

18:03.749 --> 18:05.922
my brother Niklaus
doesn't like to be told what to do.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.254
That's why
I brought you here.

18:08.821 --> 18:12.064
Marcel drove the werewolves
out of town decades ago.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.998
Do you really think
he's going to welcome

18:15.161 --> 18:17.767
a Hybrid baby
to the neighborhood?

18:19.231 --> 18:21.006
Convince Klaus to help us

18:21.167 --> 18:22.737
and no one has to know
about the newest member

18:22.902 --> 18:24.176
of the Original family.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.507
That sounds remarkably
like blackmail.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.850
Like I said,
I'm desperate.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.317
Well, then.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.354
I have my work cut out for me,
don't I?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.345
Evening, Elijah.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.641
Niklaus.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.943
What an entirely
unwelcome surprise.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.877
And what an entirely
unsurprising welcome.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.478
Come with me.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.488
I'm not going anywhere
until I find out

19:07.647 --> 19:09.684
who's conspiring against me.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.325
I believe I just
found that out for you.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.791
No. it's impossible.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.128
I said the same thing myself.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.134
This is a lie.
You're all lying.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.000
Vampires cannot procreate.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.539
But werewolves can.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.704
Magic made you a vampire...

19:27.400 --> 19:28.902
...but you were born
a werewolf.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.737
You're the Original Hybrid,

19:31.070 --> 19:32.811
the first of your kind,

19:33.072 --> 19:36.576
and this pregnancy
is one of nature's loopholes.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.854
You've been with someone else.
Admit it!

19:42.181 --> 19:43.819
Hey, I've spent days held captive

19:43.983 --> 19:45.553
in a freakin' alligator bayou

19:45.718 --> 19:46.992
because they think
that I'm carrying

19:47.153 --> 19:48.359
some magical miracle baby.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.023
Don't you think
I would've 'fessed up

19:50.189 --> 19:51.224
if it wasn't yours?

19:51.390 --> 19:53.495
My sister gave her life
to perform the spell

19:53.659 --> 19:55.935
she needed to confirm
this pregnancy.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.699
Because of Jane-Anne's sacrifice,

19:57.863 --> 19:59.604
the lives of this girl and her baby

19:59.765 --> 20:01.039
are now controlled by us.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.736
We can keep them safe.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.110
Or we can kill them.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.849
If you don't help us
take down Marcel,

20:10.076 --> 20:12.556
so help me,
Hayley won't live long enough

20:12.712 --> 20:14.282
to see her first
maternity dress.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.448
Wait, what?

20:15.614 --> 20:17.685
Enough of this. If you want
Marcel dead, he's dead.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.295
- I'll do it myself.
- No.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.190
We can't.
Not yet.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.026
We have a clear plan
that we need to follow,

20:23.189 --> 20:24.634
and there are rules.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.643
How dare you command me.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.477
Threaten me with what you

20:37.636 --> 20:39.707
wrongfully perceive
to be my weaknesses?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.977
This is a pathetic deception.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.779
I won't hear any more lies.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.786
ELIJAH: Niklaus.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.623
Listen.

21:11.670 --> 21:15.015
(HEART BEATING FAINTLY)

21:19.512 --> 21:21.685
(HEART BEATING)

21:43.869 --> 21:46.975
Kill her, and the baby.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.209
What do I care?

21:52.044 --> 21:53.682
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.887
No one touches the girl.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.230
I'll fix this.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.201
ELIJAH: Niklaus.

22:11.397 --> 22:12.671
It's a trick, Elijah.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.573
No, brother.
It's a gift.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.139
It's your chance.
It's our chance.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.337
To what?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.313
To start over.
Take back everything we lost,

22:20.472 --> 22:22.076
everything that was
taken from us.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.749
Niklaus, our own parents
came to despise us.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.015
Our family was ruined.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.385
We were ruined.
And since then,

22:28.547 --> 22:29.651
all that you
have ever wanted,

22:29.815 --> 22:31.761
all that we
have ever wanted...

22:32.585 --> 22:33.996
...was a family.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.763
I will not be
manipulated.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.331
So they're manipulating you,
so what?

22:42.494 --> 22:44.098
With them, this girl
and her child,

22:44.263 --> 22:45.833
your child...

22:47.433 --> 22:48.776
...live.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.939
I'm gonna kill
every last one of them.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.344
And then what?

22:55.507 --> 22:56.611
Then you return
to Mystic Falls

22:56.775 --> 22:58.015
to resume your life
as the hated one?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.247
As the evil Hybrid?

22:59.411 --> 23:01.118
Is it so important to you
that people quake with fear

23:01.280 --> 23:02.384
at the sound of your name?

23:02.548 --> 23:04.050
People quake with fear
because I have the power

23:04.216 --> 23:05.456
to make them afraid.

23:05.684 --> 23:06.958
What will this child offer me?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.258
Will it guarantee me power?

23:08.420 --> 23:10.593
Family is power, Niklaus.

23:10.756 --> 23:13.066
Love, loyalty, that's power.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.569
This is what we swore to
one another a thousand years ago

23:15.728 --> 23:17.264
before life tore away
what little humanity

23:17.429 --> 23:20.308
you had left.
Before ego, before anger,

23:20.466 --> 23:22.912
before paranoia created
in this person before me...

23:24.136 --> 23:26.878
...someone I can barely even
recognize as my own brother.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.743
This is us.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.215
The Original Family.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.821
We remain together,
always and forever.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.425
I am asking you to stay here.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.061
I will help you,
and I will stand by you.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.829
I will be your brother.

23:47.993 --> 23:50.405
We will build
a home here together.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.133
So, save this girl.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.105
Save your child.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.990
No.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.696
Marcel and his vampires
are out of control.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.030
Something had to be done.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.867
And the solution is to
bring in more vampires?

24:24.029 --> 24:26.168
Sophie: These aren't just
any vampires, Agnes.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.709
They're the Originals.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.608
What makes you think you
can control the Hybrid?

24:31.036 --> 24:32.379
ELIJAH: She can't.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.047
Not entirely certain
that I can, either.

24:39.778 --> 24:41.519
But now that your coven
has drawn his ire,

24:41.680 --> 24:42.954
I have a question.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.852
What prevents my brother
from murdering you

24:45.017 --> 24:46.496
instead of cooperating?

24:54.626 --> 24:55.900
Ow!

24:59.064 --> 25:00.407
What the hell?

25:02.067 --> 25:03.740

it's my business.

is my business.

all nice and friendly.

down his nose at what I done,

30:22.020 --> 30:25.001
like it's some cheap knock off
of one of his dumb paintings.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.830
Then he gets pissed off
like a little bitch

30:26.992 --> 30:28.062

Niklaus' blood would cure him.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.256
<i>and I remain a welcome guest
in (he French Quarter.</i>

39:12.817 --> 39:15.195
My only concern now

39:15.353 --> 39:18.027
is this coven
of impudent witches.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.032
I believe them to be honorable.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.402
They did release Hayley to me.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.937
Although they haven't been
entirely forthcoming.

39:26.764 --> 39:29.540
Marcel obviously has something
that they need.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.871
They don't want him dead.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.345
There must be a reason why.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.426
I assume it's all quiet out there?

39:55.793 --> 39:57.932
The witches know better
than to use magic.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.909
They know I can sense it
when they do.

40:04.602 --> 40:05.910
What about the old ones?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.748
They're dangerous,
and I don't want them to hurt you.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.443
The Originals?

40:11.709 --> 40:14.588
Davina, as powerful as you are?

40:14.746 --> 40:16.555
They don't stand
a chance.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.255
ELIJAH: In addition
to the secret weapon

40:19.417 --> 40:20.623
he uses to control the witches,

40:20.785 --> 40:23.925
Marcel has assembled
a small army of vampires.

40:24.989 --> 40:28.459
Working together,
we could destroy them from the inside.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.795
And what of Rebekah?

40:29.961 --> 40:31.565
Has she stopped her
pouting long enough

40:31.729 --> 40:33.003
to join the fun?

40:33.298 --> 40:34.436
(SIGHS)

40:34.666 --> 40:37.408
She has made her
disinterest quite clear.

40:37.669 --> 40:40.775
One too many times daggered
and shoved in a box, I gather?

40:41.005 --> 40:44.851
Or, perhaps, she doesn't share

40:45.009 --> 40:48.582
your unwavering belief
that I can be saved.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.653
Rebekah may surprise us yet.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.857
After all, we all
swore the same vow.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.359
I hope she stays far away.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.973
Because in my desire
to reclaim this town,

41:04.128 --> 41:07.371
to steal from Marcel that which
he holds most dear,

41:08.032 --> 41:12.105
I have realized one massive
vulnerability.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.714
One weakness that
Marcel could exploit.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.650
And what is that?

41:20.345 --> 41:21.346
You.

41:21.546 --> 41:22.991
(SHOUTS)

41:25.717 --> 41:27.958
Forgive me, my brother.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.667
There is no power in love.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.030
Mercy makes you weak.

41:35.393 --> 41:39.239
Family makes you weak.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.972
If I'm going to win this war...

41:45.336 --> 41:48.974
...I have to do it alone.
