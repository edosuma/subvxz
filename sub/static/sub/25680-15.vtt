10:37.637 --> 10:38.972
She's ruining
our life at home

10:39.055 --> 10:40.682
and she ruining
our life at school.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.559
Maybe we should just
tell her the truth.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.476
[wails]

10:44.060 --> 10:47.188
Oh, right.
The ugly crying.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.983
There's gotta be
an easier way.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.235
Well, what are we gonna do?
It's not like we can use Liam again.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.987
Or can we?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.322
What does Liam hate
more than anything in the world?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.825
-Us.
-True. But what else?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.160
Uh... Swimming pools!

11:00.243 --> 11:02.704
You know what?
I'm just gonna tell you the plan.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.831
Liam hates when people bug him.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.001
So we'll just tell Principal Karen to ask
him a bunch of questions.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.961
It'll drive him crazy
and he'll fire her.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.171
Great idea.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.006
And that's so much easier
than telling her the truth.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.758
Great. I'm glad we're
on the same page.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.509
And Frankie!

11:16.593 --> 11:18.386
What? You get to do it?
I don't get to do it?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.306
Hey, PK!

11:21.389 --> 11:23.016
Since you're
the new chaperone now,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.060
we wanted to pass along
some advice.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.937
See, Paige and I,
we really know Liam.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.982
Totally. And you know what
he loves more than anything?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.318
-Swimming pools.
-I'm just gonna tell you what he likes.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.364
Liam loves check-ins.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.325
He wants to know everything that's going
on in the Vuuugle house.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.077
He wants details.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.704
Deets. All the deets.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.040
Well, when your two best friends
in the whole wide world

11:47.123 --> 11:48.833
give you advice, you take it.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.961
Especially when they might
be your stepchildren some day.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.089
Wait, what?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.511
All right, let's go over
the plan again.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.180
-Rodney, what do you and Zane do?
-We order the pancakes.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.307
Yes. Zane, this is important.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.433
What do Bernie and I do?

12:05.517 --> 12:08.395
-You eat the pancakes.
-Great! Let's run it again.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.022
-We got it.
-I could use one more time.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.859
The waitress is coming.
Everyone act natural.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.237
[in Irish accent]
Top of the mornin' to ya, lassie.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.364
Great day to find
a pot o' gold, eh?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.575
Why are you talking
like a leprechaun?

12:22.659 --> 12:23.785
No, that was
a sea captain.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.745
A leprechaun
sounds like this.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.205
[gruff voice]
I'm the captain of this ship!

12:28.415 --> 12:30.959
It's a subtle difference,
but I hear it.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.670
What are you havin'?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.463
We'll have the eggs.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.799
And now
our ten-year-old friends

12:37.882 --> 12:39.259
will order
what they'd like.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.722
[both] The Ultimate Choco-Pancake
Yummy Stack, please.

12:44.472 --> 12:48.727
[gasps] Well, that
came out of the blue.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.396
Psht! What a surprise.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.482
I thought, for sure, they'd order
something off the adult menu.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.485
Like these delicious
eggs Benedict.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.237
Ooh, I do love
hollandaise sauce.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.406
You're getting the pancakes.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.702
I mean, they are under 12
and those are the rules.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.204
Mm. Well, it does
seem to check out.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.206
-How old are you? What grade are you in?
-[both] Ten! Fifth!

13:10.290 --> 13:11.708
When was the last time
you used a landline?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.543
-[both] What's a landline?
-All right, you passed.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.839
Enjoy your breakfast.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.925
All right, boys.
This is gonna be

13:21.009 --> 13:24.137
the hardest mission
any of us has ever faced.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.805
That woman plays by the rules,

13:25.889 --> 13:28.475
and she'll be watching us
like a hawk.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.894
I'm going on break.
See ya in 20.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.564
Oh. Never mind.
Let's eat!

13:35.899 --> 13:37.776
Not you.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.611
You get eggs.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.618
Those pancakes
were amazing.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.535
[belching loudly]

13:48.953 --> 13:50.205
Mmm!

13:50.288 --> 13:52.916
That is the most delicious
burp I've ever burped.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.252
I know it's not
why we came,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.754
but I liked the eggs.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.130
I liked the ambiance.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.007
It's like a boat in here.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.803
Hey, guys.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.346
How were the eggs?

14:06.471 --> 14:08.264
From the regular menu.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.934
I don't have proof.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.852
But I think I know
what went down here today.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.021
And if I catch you in here
breaking the rules again,

14:15.105 --> 14:16.523
guess what happens?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.942
-We're banned?
-You're banned!

14:20.360 --> 14:21.945
Guys, look!

14:22.028 --> 14:24.364
I'm driving the restaurant.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.746
You know what I'm not gonna miss?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.749
Principal Karen beatboxing
to wake me up every morning.

14:34.833 --> 14:35.667
-Yeah.
-[beatboxing]

14:37.711 --> 14:40.296
<i>♪ Get up, get up!</i>
<i>Everybody get dressed ♪</i>

14:40.380 --> 14:43.008
<i>♪ We're going to school,</i>
<i>I'm 35 and I rap! ♪</i>

14:45.427 --> 14:47.470
Hey, why is Liam here?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.389
I'm sure it's just
because our plan worked

14:49.472 --> 14:51.891
and he's here to tell us
how annoying PK is

14:51.975 --> 14:53.226
and that he has to fire her.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.396
Breaking the news in person.
Brits be classy.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.399
<i>Paige, Frankie,</i>

14:59.482 --> 15:02.652
<i>I need to talk with you about</i>
<i>this Principal Karen woman.</i>

15:02.736 --> 15:05.864
<i>She has been texting me all day.</i>

15:05.947 --> 15:07.699
<i>And not just texting,</i>

15:07.782 --> 15:09.701
<i>video chatting,</i>
<i>actual talking!</i>

15:09.784 --> 15:11.786
<i>It is a lot of communication.</i>

15:14.080 --> 15:15.582
<i>And I like it.</i>

15:15.665 --> 15:17.083
-What?
-Come again?

15:18.376 --> 15:21.588
<i>Yes, normally</i>
<i>a grating voice like hers</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:24.132
<i>would send me running</i>
<i>for the shores of Devonshire,</i>

15:24.215 --> 15:27.552
<i>but with her,</i>
<i>somehow it doesn't!</i>

15:27.635 --> 15:30.597
<i>I'm all topsy-turvy!</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:34.768
<i>I think I'm in love with her.</i>

15:34.851 --> 15:39.189
Oh, I'm sorry, Liam,
I think your robot's broken.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.026
Did you mean to say,
"I think Simon Blubagur"?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.572
<i>No, I said I think</i>
<i>I'm in love with her.</i>

15:47.655 --> 15:49.908
Oh, it's so much worse
the second time.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.452
<i>Can I tell you a secret?</i>

15:52.535 --> 15:54.829
Please, no.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.123
<i>Normally,</i>
<i>I'm surprisingly shy</i>

15:57.207 --> 15:58.792
<i>when it comes</i>
<i>to matters of the heart.</i>

15:58.875 --> 16:00.502
[quietly]
Gah, make it stop.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.714
<i>Would it be too much</i>
<i>of an imposition to ask</i>

16:04.798 --> 16:07.300
<i>for your help</i>
<i>in setting me up on a date</i>

16:07.384 --> 16:10.136
<i>with that gorgeous</i>
<i>specimen of womanhood?</i>

16:10.220 --> 16:11.054
[both squeaking]
Uh...

16:13.139 --> 16:15.975
<i>Because, I think</i>
<i>I'm in love with her.</i>

16:16.059 --> 16:18.228
Oh, third time really hurts.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.861
We cannot set Liam up
with Principal Karen, can we?

16:26.945 --> 16:28.655
Doesn't that like,
violate some sort of rule?

16:28.738 --> 16:31.700
Paige, we're way past rules.
He said topsy-turvy.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.660
I don't care
how fun it is to say.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.079
Those... aren't... words.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.998
So, what are we gonna do?

16:39.082 --> 16:40.500
Okay, let's think about it.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.252
If we set them up,
they could get married,

16:42.335 --> 16:44.838
move to another country,
live happily ever after,

16:44.921 --> 16:46.297
and never bother us again.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.298
Great. So let's do that.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.467
-Or...
-Ugh! There's an or.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.263
It could go bad.
They could fall so madly in love

16:53.346 --> 16:54.848
that they're
super gross about it

16:54.931 --> 16:57.183
and we have to be
around them all the time.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.562
<i>Has anyone seen the love of my life,</i>
<i>Princess Karen?</i>

17:00.645 --> 17:02.605
<i>I'm right here, Pookie Face.</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:05.316
<i>Paige, Frankie!</i>
<i>I'm in the robot.</i>

17:05.400 --> 17:07.444
<i>Do I look famous</i>
<i>now that I'm on TV?</i>

17:08.987 --> 17:10.071
<i>You're cute!</i>

17:10.155 --> 17:11.990
<i>-No, you're cute!</i>
<i>-No, you're cute!</i>

17:12.073 --> 17:13.783
[Liam and Karen cooing]

17:15.326 --> 17:16.578
[both shudder]

17:17.704 --> 17:19.664
That's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.959
We could always
not set PK up with Liam.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.711
I'm sure she'll meet
someone else eventually,

17:24.794 --> 17:26.713
fall in love, get married,
and move to Toledo.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.924
-Why Toledo?
-Why not Toledo?

17:30.592 --> 17:31.843
Okay, Toledo.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.512
Okay, let's do that.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.805
Or...

17:35.889 --> 17:37.891
Come on, there can't be an or,
I gave you Toledo.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.894
If we don't
set Liam and PK up,

17:40.977 --> 17:42.979
there's a chance
she'll never meet anyone else

17:43.063 --> 17:44.606
and just stay here
with us forever.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.900
Before we know it,
we'll be just like her.

17:46.983 --> 17:47.817
[both]
What up, girlio?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.112
Look what we got
at the mall.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.739
They're sparkle pillows.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.157
-Do you love them?
-'Cause we love them.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.408
-Unless you don't love them.
-Then we hate them.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.743
I love them.

17:56.826 --> 17:57.660
[both]
We love them!

17:58.703 --> 18:01.373
And guess when and how often
I want to use them?

18:01.456 --> 18:03.667
[all] All day, e'ry day!

18:06.961 --> 18:08.963
[screaming]

18:11.466 --> 18:12.926
Okay, there's no
easy way out here.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.386
I'm over the easy way.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.222
Every time we've tried it,
it's totally backfired on us

18:17.305 --> 18:18.723
and something worse
has happened.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.684
Okay, I have an idea,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.394
but I'm not sure
you're gonna like it.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.813
We have to tell PK
the truth about everything.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.607
-I like it.
-You like it? I like it too.

18:27.691 --> 18:30.193
Unless you don't like it,
then I hate it. Aah, it's happening.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.119
Ugh! Regular pancakes stink.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.538
Even these sprinkles
don't make them taste better.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.540
That's glitter.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.751
What did Principal Karen
do to this place?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.087
What's different?

18:50.672 --> 18:52.590
Whatever. I can't stop
thinking about

18:52.674 --> 18:54.634
the Ultimate Choco-Pancake
Yummy Stack.

18:54.718 --> 18:58.221
Me too. It's literally
all I can think about.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.056
I don't care
what that waitress says.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.516
We're going back.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.351
Everyone loves a sequel.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.229
Boys!

19:06.312 --> 19:09.399
We wanna pull off one more pancake heist.
You in?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.525
No can do.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.737
We're retried from the life of
breakfast crime.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.322
We can't risk getting banned
from that diner.

19:16.406 --> 19:20.035
The soup and salad lunch combo
is just so reasonably priced.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.495
Boys.

19:22.579 --> 19:26.875
The way I see it, there are two ways
you can live your life.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.628
Like a boring bowl of cereal,
just waiting to go mushy and stale.

19:30.712 --> 19:36.509
Or like a pancake on a griddle--
hot, fast, and on the edge.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.096
Make your choice, 'cause
I sure as heck made mine.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.849
-We're in.
-Wait.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.017
Can we wear hats?

19:44.100 --> 19:46.019
-No.
-We're in.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.612
Okay, boys. This is the moment
we've been training for.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.282
Operation Pancake-Take II:
This Time it's Personal, is a go.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.455
Stop looking at us.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.291
We have to play it cool
for this operation to work.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.794
Operation Pancake-Take II:
This Time it's Personal.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.755
Oh, just the two
of you today?

20:13.838 --> 20:17.342
Yep. Just the two of us.
Just us kids, no adults here.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.638
Okay. What can I get you?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.390
[whispering]
Three, two, one.

20:23.473 --> 20:27.602
[both] Twenty Ultimate Choco-Pancake
Yummy Stacks to go, please.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.354
To go?

20:31.231 --> 20:34.776
What's the matter?
You have somewhere to be?

20:36.945 --> 20:38.154
I think she's on to us.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.490
Relax. You're kids.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.450
She'll serve you, you'll pay.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.661
And we'll have pancakes
in the freezer for weeks.

20:44.744 --> 20:49.916
Just stick to the plan.
I repeat: stick to the plan.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.503
I don't know, man. I'm starting to feel
guilty all of a sudden.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.132
We got the fuzz, man!

20:58.717 --> 21:00.969
We got the judges, man!

21:01.803 --> 21:04.723
You're almost home, boys.
Stay steady.

21:04.806 --> 21:09.227
Okay. I've got 20 Ultimate Choco-Pancake
Yummy Stacks here.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.854
[whispering]
Three, two, one...

21:10.937 --> 21:11.771
[both]
Thanks.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.649
Okay. Enjoy your pancakes.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.445
Phew, that was close.
But we did it, man.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.156
Oh, by the way.
You boys need syrup?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.824
This is a pancake heist!

21:22.907 --> 21:24.284
We're working with them!

21:25.702 --> 21:29.581
Operation Pancake-Take II: This Time it's
Personal is compromised!

21:29.664 --> 21:31.499
Stop talking and run!

21:33.918 --> 21:36.755
You kids should be
ashamed of yourselves.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.424
Breaking the rules.
And for what?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.051
Some pancakes?

21:41.134 --> 21:43.261
I mean, how good
could they be?

21:45.263 --> 21:46.848
Tastes like pancake.

21:47.932 --> 21:48.933
Wait a minute.

21:49.017 --> 21:52.437
You just ate something
from the kids menu.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.647
You know what that means?

21:54.731 --> 21:56.149
[all] You're banned!

21:56.649 --> 21:58.651
Judges, take her away.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.821
No? Not really
your jurisdiction?

22:01.905 --> 22:03.323
That's cool.
Enjoy your meal.

22:06.993 --> 22:10.163
Hey, Principal Karen.
Um, you got a sec?

22:10.246 --> 22:11.456
For you two, anything.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.000
No, seriously. I would do
anything for you two.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.755
So, um...
The truth is...

22:18.838 --> 22:22.509
We kinda sorta didn't want you
to join Bizaardvark.

22:22.592 --> 22:26.054
And maybe we told you some lies to get you
not to be the house chaperone.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.097
-We're sorry.
-So sorry.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.766
-But now Liam's in love with you.
-Topsy-turvy.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.726
And our instinct
was to ruin that.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.436
But we don't play that game
anymore, girlfriend.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.813
So, if you want
to be in Bizaardvark...

22:34.896 --> 22:36.147
Or to chaperone the house...

22:36.231 --> 22:38.400
Or marry Liam
and move to Toledo...

22:38.483 --> 22:40.652
-Toledo?
-Toledo.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.279
Toledo.

22:43.363 --> 22:47.242
The point is, it's your life,
we care about you.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.453
So, what do you think?

22:50.537 --> 22:54.290
What do I think?
What do I think?

22:54.374 --> 22:57.210
I think you two
are obsessed with me.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.796
-I'm sorry?
-Say what?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.632
It seems like you've been
thinking about me a lot.

23:02.716 --> 23:07.220
And, quite frankly,
I am feeling pretty smothered.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.223
-I'm sorry?
-Say what?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.309
I think it's best that we have
some separation between us.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.854
Maybe I should quit
being a chaperone.

23:15.937 --> 23:18.148
And as much as you
want me back in Bizaardvark,

23:18.231 --> 23:20.817
I have to say no.
I'm sorry, not sorry.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.237
But you two...
need to get a life.

23:25.530 --> 23:26.906
See you at school.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.868
And seriously,
respect my space.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.830
Can you believe
what she just said?

23:33.913 --> 23:35.749
It doesn't matter.
It worked!

23:35.832 --> 23:37.751
Oh my gosh, I didn't even hear that part.
It worked!

23:37.834 --> 23:39.627
We did it!

23:39.711 --> 23:41.588
For once, we didn't
take the easy way out,

23:41.671 --> 23:44.382
did the right thing,
and it didn't backfire on us.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.843
In your face, universe!

23:48.720 --> 23:51.681
<i>She's gone!</i>
<i>Gone!</i>

23:51.765 --> 23:55.518
<i>Without so much</i>
<i>as a TTYL.</i>

23:55.602 --> 23:59.689
<i>Thank goodness I have</i>
<i>my two best friends to lean on.</i>

23:59.773 --> 24:02.108
[mouths]
Best friends?

24:03.193 --> 24:04.944
<i>May I read you some poems</i>

24:05.028 --> 24:06.613
<i>I've written about my feelings?</i>

24:06.696 --> 24:08.031
[both] Uh...

24:09.741 --> 24:12.077
<i>Good. They're very long.</i>

24:12.160 --> 24:15.538
<i>This one's called...</i>

24:15.622 --> 24:17.999
<i>"My Entire Childhood."</i>
