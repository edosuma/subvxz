I'll have to return to Mexico
for 30 days

18:19.932 --> 18:21.334
and, uh,
reapply for my visa,

18:21.368 --> 18:23.403
but, uh, he said
it shouldn't be a problem.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.004
But when he comes back,

18:25.037 --> 18:27.640
Hector's going to help us
incorporate.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.309
He says
it will cost money now,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.978
but we'll save so much money
in the future.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.781
That is literally what I said.
I said the exact same thing.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.384
I think you put Hector
through enough.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.921
We are even now.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.624
Please don't embarrass me
by thanking me,

18:44.657 --> 18:47.160
and I won't embarrass you
by apologizing.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.195
O...kay.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.498
I'm sorry for not being
straight with you, boss.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.665
It's all right.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.133
I really thought
you were a citizen, though.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.868
You gave me
a Social Security number.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.371
I gave you the code
to get directly to Mike Tyson

18:58.405 --> 18:59.806

to go live!

Unlock the doors.

19:08.748 --> 19:13.085
Precinct 42 is officially open
for democracy!

19:14.086 --> 19:16.556
I can't believe
only four voters showed up.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.392
With voter apathy
 at an all-time high,

19:19.426 --> 19:23.029
this election had the lowest
 turnout in modern history.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.631
But break out
 the Cuban sandwiches,

19:24.664 --> 19:28.335

 was stopped at the border.

What Gus is trying to say
is that it was defeated.

It's a confusing,
racially problematic

19:34.841 --> 19:36.008
choice of words.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.177
Well, tell that to all

Countywide early returns

19:40.112 --> 19:42.482
all precincts
went to Bill Clinton.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.483
Hell yeah!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.518
Except for Precinct 42,

19:45.552 --> 19:49.856
where Bob Dole miraculously won
by a landslide!

19:49.889 --> 19:52.692
Yes! You said that Bob Dole
wouldn't win any precincts!

19:52.725 --> 19:55.762
Yes, congratulations
on your victory, Emery.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.068
Who did you vote for,
Dad?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.503
Oh, no.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.538
I was so focused
on running the polling station,

20:05.572 --> 20:07.240
I forgot to vote.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.875
I'm part of the problem.

You are also
part of the solution.

the process intimidate me.

Bring on the interrogation.
I'm ready.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.755
Mm.
I want to be able
to vote.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.991
