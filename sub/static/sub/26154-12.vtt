WEBVTT

00:09.718 --> 00:11.553
[Todd] You shut down production?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.138
Just for a couple of days.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.806
What is going on over there?

00:14.889 --> 00:18.643
-It's a minor injury issue.
-A stunt went slightly awry.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.561
Again?

00:19.644 --> 00:21.354
And one of our stars
got a little strangled.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.023
-What?
-Just a little strangled.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.899
Like, the minimum amount of strangled.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.153
Everyone's fine now.
It's like it didn't even happen.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.196
-Except...
-Except what?

00:30.280 --> 00:33.324
Some crew members might have taken
some video of the incident

00:33.408 --> 00:35.201
that could leak to the press
at any moment.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.119
But that's it!

00:36.202 --> 00:37.579
Okay, I'm pulling the plug.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.496
-[Flip] What?
-No!

00:38.580 --> 00:40.540
It's too dangerous!
We gotta cut our losses.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.334
Cut your losses?
Philbert  is a monster hit!

00:43.418 --> 00:44.961
We put your site on the map, boy-o,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.213
so don't get squeamish now
about sunk cost.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.507
Face it: You need us
like a fish needs a bicycle

00:49.591 --> 00:52.052
in Portland, Austin, Boulder,
or Minneapolis, Saint Paul!

00:52.135 --> 00:53.428
You are out of order.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.723
Fine. Switch Boulder and Austin
and move the Twin Cities to the front.

00:56.806 --> 00:59.768
Now, can you give me a chance
to get everything under control?

00:59.851 --> 01:03.396
-[Henry slams door]  Yes! Yes! Yes!
-[Todd sighs] You have one more chance.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.523
Do you promise me
you can take care of this?

01:05.607 --> 01:08.443
I'm clearing my docket.
This is my only priority.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.945
Good,
because my boss has made it very clear

01:11.029 --> 01:15.658
that if we let him down, he will, quote,
"eat my ass for dinner."

01:16.659 --> 01:19.204
[theme music playing]

02:10.797 --> 02:13.591
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[ringtone playing]

02:18.721 --> 02:19.848
-[phone beeps]
-Hello?

02:19.931 --> 02:22.225
Hey, buddy, well, how ya feeling today?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.853
Weird.
Am I supposed to be on set right now?

02:24.936 --> 02:27.230
You just stay right there.
I'm coming over.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.773
-Okay.
-Do me a favor, though?

02:28.857 --> 02:31.025
Maybe don't watch any TV,
or go on the Internet,

02:31.109 --> 02:33.903
or take any phone calls
from anybody else until I get there, okay?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.071
-What?
-[touch tones beeping]

02:35.155 --> 02:36.197
-Ugh.
-[line ringing]

02:36.281 --> 02:37.448
-Stuart.
-What up?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.534
Draft an email to Biscuits Braxby.

02:39.617 --> 02:43.121
I wanna set up an interview for--
Hold on, I'm getting another call.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.039
You want that part in the email?

02:45.123 --> 02:47.167
-Hello?
-Princess Carolyn! It's Sadie.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.836
Remember me? You wanted my baby,
and you came down to Eden,

02:49.919 --> 02:53.339
then you thought about your past a lot,
and I decided not to give you my baby?

02:53.423 --> 02:57.302
Of course I remember you, Sadie.
Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.388
Anyway, I got to thinking... I interviewed
a lot of people for adoption.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.390
After I said
I wasn't gonna give them the baby,

03:02.473 --> 03:05.602
They all went cold or nasty. Except you.
You were still nice.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.687
-[tires screech]
-I think that's a sign. [grunts]

03:07.770 --> 03:09.731
-How fast can you get to Eden?
-Why?

03:09.814 --> 03:11.649
My boyfriend left me,
my mama stole my truck,

03:11.733 --> 03:14.068
-and I don't want this baby no more.
-Oh, fish, Sadie.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.987
I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.697
You're in the middle of something?

03:17.780 --> 03:19.908
I'm about as deep in contractions
as an apostrophe!

03:20.200 --> 03:23.119
-[panting]
-I know. This is all just coming so fast.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.412
I... Let me call you back.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.081
Okay, but if this baby pops out
and you're not here,

03:27.165 --> 03:29.125
-I'm putting it in a dumpster.
-[gasps]

03:29.209 --> 03:33.087
I'm kidding,
I'm giving it to someone else. [grunts]

03:36.925 --> 03:38.426
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.429
I always forget how tiny
and Dickensian this place is.

03:41.512 --> 03:45.016
It's really great how you don't need
nice things to be happy.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.518
-Yes, I agree. What do you want?
-[door closes]

03:47.602 --> 03:49.812
For the last couple months,
I've had work to distract me,

03:49.896 --> 03:53.942
but now that we're on strangle hiatus,
I can't stop thinking about that "thing"

03:54.025 --> 03:55.818
that happened in the prepiere
of the  Philbert.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.820
-"Strangle hiatus?"
-Diane, stay on topic.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.365
-You know what "thing" I'm talking about?
-Yes.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.741
-The thing between us?
-Got it.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.659
When we had sex?

04:02.825 --> 04:05.203
I was on top and then briefly on bottom.
Human-y style?

04:05.286 --> 04:06.120
Yep, I remember.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.582
Pickles has no idea,
and I've never felt so guilty in my life.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.042
I hate keeping secrets from people.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.294
It's like Rob Schneider's
surprise party all over again.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.004
You cheating on your girlfriend

04:15.088 --> 04:17.799
is not the same
as Rob Schneider's surprise party.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.635
You're right, this is much less sad
and involves more people.

04:20.718 --> 04:25.390
-Just tell Pickles the truth.
-Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.725
-Could you do it?
-What? No!

04:27.809 --> 04:31.521
But you're so good at bumming people out.
I'm more of a "good news" guy.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.898
You want your ex-wife to explain the fact

04:33.982 --> 04:37.110
that you cheated  with  your ex-wife
to your current girlfriend?

04:37.193 --> 04:40.780
Well, of course every idea sounds stupid
if you describe what it is.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.366
You're not the only one
who feels gross about that night.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.411
Do you have any idea how shitty I felt
after you left?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.288
So I made you feel gross, and now...

04:48.371 --> 04:51.624
No, you didn't make me anything!
I am gross.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.502
I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.

04:54.585 --> 04:57.005
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,

04:57.088 --> 05:00.717
but a barge, floating out to sea,
with no rudder.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.845
I am a rudderless burning
large garbage barge.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.556
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way
all the time,

05:06.639 --> 05:09.600
but I don't usually,
and now, for the first time ever, I do,

05:09.684 --> 05:11.686
and I don't know what to do
with that feeling!

05:11.769 --> 05:14.397
-Good! You should feel bad!
-Well, I do!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.441
-Great! Me, too!
-Great!

05:16.524 --> 05:17.358
Great!

05:18.484 --> 05:22.864
[both moaning, kissing]

05:26.367 --> 05:29.871
So, what, exactly,
do you think happened last night?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.205
Uh...

05:31.289 --> 05:33.833
I don't know. We shot some stuff?

05:34.625 --> 05:37.253
There was an accident on set
and Gina got injured.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.005
-Oh, my God, she did?
-She's fine.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.008
-But some footage has gotten out.
-Footage?

05:42.091 --> 05:43.801
And because of how it looks,

05:43.885 --> 05:47.388
some people might get the impression
that you were trying to hurt Gina.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.224
-They're gonna get the impression.
-Right.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.268
-But I wasn't.
-Of course not.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.186
What did happen?

05:53.269 --> 05:58.107
So, the two of you are gonna do
a sit-down interview with Biscuits Braxby.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.400
[chuckles] She makes news fun!

05:59.484 --> 06:02.653
Yes. All you need to say is that
you know the footage looks bad,

06:02.737 --> 06:04.155
but you and Gina are actors.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.740
You performed a convincing scene,

06:05.823 --> 06:08.201
and you can't wait
for everyone to see the new season.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.246
Well, it seems like you've got everything
under control.

06:12.747 --> 06:16.000
[sighs] I'm sorry things got so messy
with the show.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.461
I didn't always look out for you
as much as I should have.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.047
I can take care of myself.
I know you've got a lot on your plate.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.758
It's just been so crazy,
this adoption process,

06:23.841 --> 06:27.553
but I think once I get a baby,
my life will be less hectic, you know?

06:28.304 --> 06:29.138
Oh, sure.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.891
That is why new mothers always
seem so chilled-out and well-rested.

06:31.974 --> 06:32.809
Okay, buddy.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.436
Why don't you save your funny jokes
for the interview?

06:36.270 --> 06:38.398
But please don't make jokes
at the interview.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.733
[both sigh]

06:41.526 --> 06:43.820
Sorry I broke every piece
of furniture you own.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.448
-Will 20 dollars cover it?
-Don't worry about it. But, yes.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.367
-So, what happens now?
-I don't know.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.160
-I have to tell Pickles.
-Yeah.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.414
-I'll tell her you and I had a talk.
-Okay.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.541
-And we're getting back together.
-Wait, what?

06:56.624 --> 06:58.584
-But she's a great girl.
-No, no.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.628
But she is a great girl.
You just don't know her.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.004
No, Mr. Peanutbutter.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.424
I don't want to get back together
with you.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.717
-What?
-I think you misunderstood.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.555
-Then why do you keep doing this?
-Why do you keep doing this?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.056
-Because I love you!
-Don't say that.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.183
It's true. I never stopped loving you.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.437
No. We can't do this ever again.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.272
-I'm sorry.
-[sighs]

07:19.355 --> 07:22.358
See? I told you you were great
at giving bad news.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.277
That is not what I wanted to hear.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.616
BoJack, Biscuits. Biscuits, BoJack.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.495
This interview's gonna go down smooth,
like a 1995 Zinfandel.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.457
You ever try one of those '95 zins?
Good year for Zinfandels.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.625
Bad year for Oklahoma federal buildings.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.379
-M'kay.
-Here's how it's gonna go down.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.466
Red light on the camera goes bloop!
I go, "Hey!" You go, "Hey!" I go, "Video?"

07:46.549 --> 07:47.717
You go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?"

07:47.800 --> 07:50.011
You go, "Well..." and you roll me
through the rigamarole.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.971
-Oh, don't--
-Don't forget to plug your show.

07:52.054 --> 07:54.599
Then I go, "Wow. This has been
so illuminating. Thank you so much."

07:54.682 --> 07:57.226
Red light goes boo-de-de-boop,
we'll be out of here before  Traffic.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.104
And, yes, I'm talking about
the Stephen Soderbergh movie  Traffic.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.107
It's playing on FX tonight,
and I'm hoping to catch it.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.442
Love me some Cheadle.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.945
Am I crazy
or was she kind of hitting on me?

08:08.029 --> 08:10.114
Yeah. You guys have a real flirty energy,

08:10.198 --> 08:13.910
like Matt Lauer and those magazine
cut-outs he now interviews in his kitchen.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.621
-This should be fun.
-Now that's the spirit!

08:17.079 --> 08:18.247
You gotta show me this video.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.957
No, I really don't think
that's necessary.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.460
I'll look like an idiot
if I don't know what I'm talking about.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.545
Just let me see it. How bad could it be?

08:24.629 --> 08:28.174
Cut to: "Ooh, it's really bad!"
But, no, seriously, can I see it?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.717
[sighs]

08:30.301 --> 08:32.553
-[BoJack grunting in video]
-Hey, wow, look at me go.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.680
-[Princess Carolyn's voice] BoJack!
-Oh. Oh!

08:34.764 --> 08:36.724
Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um...

08:37.141 --> 08:38.351
Well, this looks like...

08:38.684 --> 08:39.519
Yeah.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.355
Because I'm actually...

08:43.564 --> 08:44.482
Yeah.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.242
Diane! What have you been up to?
Tell me everything.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.285
Actually, I've been working
on a book of essays--

08:56.369 --> 08:57.995
Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite,

08:58.079 --> 08:59.914
and it's very rude of you
to assume that I care.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.542
I have news that's actually interesting.

09:02.625 --> 09:07.213
Girl Croosh is pivoting to video,
and I want you to be  the face.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.714
-The face?
-Of the site.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.926
Every woman under 40 will tune in
to hear what you have to say.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.345
And possibly women over 40,
but we have no way of knowing

09:14.428 --> 09:16.389
because they're invisible
to our site metrics.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.932
Stefani... no.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.476
I don't understand.
My parents never said no to me growing up,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.437
so I'm literally incapable
of processing it as a concept.

09:23.646 --> 09:27.692
I'm a hypocrite. I'm miserable
and I make other people miserable.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.112
I don't know what I'm doing.
I can't be a trusted news source,

09:31.195 --> 09:34.448
or an authority,
or a role model for anybody.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.034
Uh, no one called you a "role model."
Settle down.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.161
-Oh. Um...
-You know what your problem is?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.831
You hold everyone
to an impossible standard,

09:41.914 --> 09:43.749
including yourself.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.752
It's super helpful
for writing hot-take shakedowns,

09:46.836 --> 09:50.006
and clickbait take-downs,
but totally toxic for your personal life

09:50.089 --> 09:52.508
and internalized sense
of self-worth, girl.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.677
But shouldn't we be asking
more of ourselves

09:54.760 --> 09:58.806
-and of the people in our lives?
-Of course. But we all fail, Diane.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.058
The world is unforgiving enough as it is.

10:01.142 --> 10:05.187
The least we could do is find ways
to forgive each other and ourselves.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.441
Well, then maybe we should be
more forgiving in our content,

10:08.524 --> 10:11.068
and maybe not publish so many take-downs?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.695
Oh, Diane.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.242
- All right, let's bring in the talent.
-[mumbling]

10:18.326 --> 10:20.077
-[gasps]
-Hey, is this a good time to talk?

10:20.161 --> 10:23.623
No, Stuart. This is a very bad time.
We're about to shoot the interview.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.208
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorized
your schedule.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.919
-You could write it down.
-With what, a quill?

10:29.003 --> 10:31.339
-Okay, Elbridge Gerry.
-What?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.883
Anyway, this lady showed up
at the office

10:33.966 --> 10:36.719
and she was being super annoying,
so I brought her here.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.262
-What lady? [gasps]
-Hey.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.182
Why aren't you answering your phone?
Why aren't you in North Carolina?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.975
We're having a bit of a PR crisis.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.895
As soon as this is settled
I will take the first plane there,

10:45.978 --> 10:47.730
but this is just not the best time.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.858
Look, if you can't do this, don't do it.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.111
My mom worked all the time
and she never made time for me.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.072
I felt so alone growing up,

10:56.155 --> 10:58.824
especially because I never knew my dad
or my twin brother

10:58.908 --> 11:01.160
because our parents broke up
when we were babies,

11:01.243 --> 11:03.204
and wouldn't even talk to each other.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.748
Oh, Tracy, I had no idea.

11:05.831 --> 11:06.874
My whole life,

11:06.957 --> 11:11.253
all I had was this half of a medallion
with part of a family crest on it.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.173
The crest of a family I'll never know.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.092
-Boring.
-Ex-squeeze me?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.677
Sorry, but your story sucks.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.721
I mean, who wasn't separated
from their family as a baby

11:20.805 --> 11:22.640
and still wears their half of a medallion

11:22.723 --> 11:26.143
in the hopes of one day being reunited
with their long-lost twin?

11:26.227 --> 11:29.146
That exact thing happened to me
and you don't see me bitching about it.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.066
-God, get over yourself.
-Get over yourself.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.193
I didn't realize it was a common thing.

11:34.276 --> 11:38.155
Well, obviously it is,
so can you get to your point already?

11:38.239 --> 11:41.826
I was getting to it
if you'd quit talking already.

11:41.909 --> 11:45.830
My point is, not every woman is supposed
to be a mother.

11:45.913 --> 11:46.914
Maybe you'd be happier

11:46.997 --> 11:49.250
if you freed yourself
from that expectation,

11:49.333 --> 11:52.753
and just lived the life
you'd clearly rather be living.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.754
Two minutes to air!

11:53.838 --> 11:57.425
No, that's not... I'm not...
I can't even deal with this right now.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.969
-You need to leave.
-All right, let's go.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.262
She's in one of her moods.

12:01.345 --> 12:05.015
I still think it's pretty nutty
we both have the left half of a medallion.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.392
Like, what are the odds?

12:06.475 --> 12:09.770
Nah, it's a completely different thing
with me. Mine is the right half.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.731
-So...
-Oh, okay.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.318
[exhales]

12:18.446 --> 12:19.697
[clears throat] Hey.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.159
-Hello, BoJack.
-Are you okay? You look good.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.702
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.288
-Gina, I'm so sorry.
-Let's just do the interview, okay?

12:27.371 --> 12:29.415
-I'm gonna come clean about everything.
-What?

12:29.498 --> 12:30.916
Everyone needs to know what I did.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.835
-[bell rings]
-[man] Please get in positions.

12:32.918 --> 12:33.794
No. Don't do that.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.964
Gina, what I did to you--
I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.299
I'll say it was pretty bad.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.633
-It was assault.
-Yeah.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.135
You physically overpowered me,

12:41.218 --> 12:44.096
and if there were any justice,
you would be in jail right now.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.014
Okay, so...

12:45.097 --> 12:45.931
But my career,

12:46.015 --> 12:49.268
after so many failed attempts,
is finally starting to take off.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.687
I am getting offers, and fan mail,

12:51.771 --> 12:54.440
and magazine columns
about what a good actor I am.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.692
People know me because of my acting.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.528
And all that goes away if I'm just

12:59.612 --> 13:01.405
the girl who got choked
by BoJack Horseman.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.448
I can't lie about this.

13:02.531 --> 13:06.118
I don't want you to be the most notable
thing that ever happened to me.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.621
I don't want you to be the question
I get asked in interviews

13:08.704 --> 13:09.705
for the rest of my life.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.291
-Gina, I--
-You need to do this for me, okay?

13:12.374 --> 13:13.834
Because I just want this to be over.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.128
Can we talk about it,
maybe after the interview?

13:16.253 --> 13:19.048
No. I will be civil to you on set
when we have scenes together,

13:19.131 --> 13:22.176
but otherwise, I never wanna think
about you again.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.346
-Hey, guys, how are we doing?
-So good, Biscuits.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.890
We're so excited to be here,
aren't we, BoJack?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.059
-Um, yeah.
-[buzzer blares]

13:30.976 --> 13:33.687
I'm here with BoJack Horseman
and Gina Cazador,

13:33.771 --> 13:36.023
stars of the hit show  Philbert.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.275
Let's cut to the chase. That video.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.320
[chuckles] Oh, my God,
it's so embarrassing.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.075
-This is all a misunderstanding.
-I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.160
We've actually been laughing
about it here on set!

13:48.244 --> 13:50.120
[both chuckling]

13:50.204 --> 13:53.207
Really?
BoJack looks so angry in the video.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.376
And Gina, you look terrified.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.753
Biscuits, we're actors. It's what we do.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.339
-Oh, thank God.
-Yep, actors.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.759
Okay, I gotta ask.
Is the story true? Are you two an item?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.302
[laughs] Busted!

14:05.386 --> 14:07.638
Oh, boy.
Looks like you got your scoop!

14:07.721 --> 14:09.139
Can you give us a kiss?

14:09.223 --> 14:10.516
-Uh...
-Sure thing.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.101
[kisses]

14:12.726 --> 14:16.105
-What's it like dating your co-star?
-It's so great.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.816
I'll bet sometimes, though,
you wanna strangle each other, right?

14:18.899 --> 14:19.817
Oh, you bet!

14:19.900 --> 14:22.403
-[BoJack chuckles]
-[Gina growling]

14:22.862 --> 14:26.407
Okay, you two.
This has been illuminating.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.742
-Thank you so much.
-[bell rings]

14:28.826 --> 14:31.328
-[man] That's a cut!
-That was amazing.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.246
[Gina] Mm-hmm.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.623
[sighs]

14:39.128 --> 14:40.754
You wanted to see me, Mr. Fondle?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.592
[Henry]  I must make love to you.

14:44.675 --> 14:48.429
[chuckles] You mean to my brain,
because I have such good ideas.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.223
Thanks for the encouragement.
I never got that at my last job.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.516
[Henry]  Nice boobs.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.059
That's exactly right.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.937
Those guys were nice,
but they were total boobs.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.231
Anyway, I'm gonna go review
the third quarter budget

14:59.315 --> 15:00.399
with our diagnostics team.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.277
-[Henry]  Insufficient power.
- To review the budget?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.154
-[panel beeping]
-[Henry]  Insufficient power.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.574
Are you saying I don't have the authority
to do my job?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.409
[Henry]  Now entering sleep mode.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.952
You wanna sleep with me?

15:12.036 --> 15:14.622
That is not a mode
I'm comfortable with, Mr. Fondle.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.665
[Henry]  Please connect to power source!

15:16.749 --> 15:17.583
[gasps]

15:18.918 --> 15:20.878
So first, he said
I had insufficient power...

15:20.961 --> 15:21.795
Wow.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.714
Which I have never heard him say
to a man.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.592
And then he asked me to "connect"
to his "power source."

15:26.675 --> 15:29.929
Did you feel physically threatened?
Was there any implication of assault?

15:30.012 --> 15:33.557
Not assault, but he did make a mention
of "low battery".

15:33.641 --> 15:36.810
It is never acceptable to threaten
an employee with battery at any level.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.896
What time is it right now?

15:38.979 --> 15:41.523
For female employees
of one popular website,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.318
the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock!

15:44.401 --> 15:47.488
What started with the allegations
of one junior executive

15:47.571 --> 15:50.741
has quickly snowballed
into an avalanche of accusation,

15:50.824 --> 15:53.077
as women at every level have come forward

15:53.160 --> 15:55.996
with their own harrowing stories
of what happens

15:56.080 --> 15:59.083
when the big hand
meets the little hand.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.213
He said he wanted to "...get all up
in my guts with his penis

16:04.296 --> 16:06.048
and ejaculate inside me."

16:06.131 --> 16:08.884
At the time, I just thought
it was typical corporate banter,

16:08.968 --> 16:12.096
but now I'm like, uh...

16:12.346 --> 16:13.597
Look, obviously,

16:13.681 --> 16:17.518
men should not be engaging
in predatory behavior at the office,

16:17.601 --> 16:21.188
but I'm worried now the pendulum's
gonna swing too far in the other extreme

16:21.271 --> 16:24.566
where they'll be held accountable
for that behavior, and that's not ideal.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.861
Uh, Henry Fondle is a sex robot,

16:27.945 --> 16:31.782
and he should not be a CEO
of any company.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.494
[reporter] When you say "sex robot,"
you're speaking metaphorically, right?

16:36.537 --> 16:37.579
No.

16:38.038 --> 16:42.042
The board has taken decisive action
to remove Henry Fondle

16:42.126 --> 16:44.503
by placing him
on an indefinite paid leave.

16:44.586 --> 16:48.382
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back,
canceling our slate of streaming series

16:48.465 --> 16:51.969
and refocusing on our original mission
of being a website you can go to

16:52.052 --> 16:55.014
if you don't know what time it is,
that also doesn't harass anyone.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.474
This is a great day for the women
of this company,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.476
many of whom will be laid off.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.645
-[reporters clamoring]
-[camera shutter clicking]

17:02.021 --> 17:05.566
So, you got a call from your dentist;
no cavities.

17:05.649 --> 17:08.694
Emily Van Camp wants to move
your four o'clock to five.

17:08.777 --> 17:13.073
And also, Todd wanted me to let you know
that the network folded,

17:13.157 --> 17:15.909
everyone got fired...
[yawns] And your show is canceled.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.370
-What?
-It's over. It's all over.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.622
What are you talking about?
It's not over.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.833
We just have to find our baby
another home.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.793
Maybe What Time Is It Right Now is gone,

17:24.877 --> 17:27.129
but there are like a billion
other websites, right?

17:27.212 --> 17:30.257
What about that website you go to,
to pay your parking tickets?

17:30.340 --> 17:33.093
Or if we're really desperate, TNT?

17:33.177 --> 17:36.013
The point is we're just getting started,
Princess Carolyn!

17:36.096 --> 17:38.015
-[door grinds]
-Princess Carolyn?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.225
-[phone rings]
-She's gone.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.769
Unless...

17:42.394 --> 17:45.481
I was Princess Carolyn the whole time.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.734
Mm.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.986
[in female voice] Oh, fish!

17:53.405 --> 17:56.742
Well, this is it, Henry Fondle.
The end of the line.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.993
[man] Hiya, hotshot.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.622
I've been following your career
pretty closely and I like what I see.

18:01.705 --> 18:05.084
How'd you like a corner office
at Disney-Fox-AT&T-AOL-

18:05.167 --> 18:08.879
Time-Warner- Pepsico-Viacom-Halliburton-
Skynet-Toyota-Trader-Joe's?

18:08.962 --> 18:10.089
[Henry]  Give it to me!

18:10.172 --> 18:14.343
Uh, you know this guy just got fired
for sexual harassment, right?

18:14.426 --> 18:18.055
Yeah, so he's learned his lesson
and he's ready to reenter the workforce.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.057
[Henry]  I have many penises.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.726
[chuckles] You said it, buddy.
Give us a call.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.482
Do you wanna take a ride?
There's something I wanna show you.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.609
[Henry]  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

18:32.694 --> 18:33.946
[knocking on door]

18:35.697 --> 18:37.491
Oh, hello.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.327
Shouldn't you be out
"not really strangling" someone?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.662
The last time I saw you,

18:41.745 --> 18:44.248
you said you still believed
I could be a better person.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.542
-Do you still believe that?
-I do.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.585
I need you to write one
of your take-downs.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.628
-About me.
-What?

18:49.711 --> 18:52.631
You can't write anything
about Gina, but... the other stuff.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.091
Everything. I need to get it out.

18:54.216 --> 18:58.929
No. I'm done writing about you,
or for you, or with you.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.556
Diane, please, I need this.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.558
I'm a bad guy
and the world needs to know.

19:02.641 --> 19:06.311
There's no such thing as "bad guys"
or "good guys."

19:06.395 --> 19:07.896
We're all just... guys...

19:07.980 --> 19:11.567
who do good stuff sometimes
and bad stuff sometimes.

19:11.650 --> 19:15.779
And all we can do is try to do
less bad stuff and more good stuff,

19:15.863 --> 19:19.283
but you're never going to be good.
Because you're not bad.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.618
So, you need to stop using that
as an excuse.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.787
I am asking to be held accountable.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.956
And I'm telling you it's not gonna happen.

19:26.039 --> 19:30.002
Whatever you put in that story,
no one is gonna "hold you accountable."

19:30.085 --> 19:32.171
You need to take responsibility
for yourself.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.797
I don't know how to do that!

19:33.881 --> 19:34.715
[Diane sighs]

19:34.798 --> 19:36.508
[BoJack grunting]

19:37.801 --> 19:38.927
[sighs]

19:40.429 --> 19:42.890
This is it. My special thinking spot.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.226
[Henry]  Let us put on
a Lionel Richie album,

19:46.310 --> 19:48.478
and finger each other's holes.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.566
Shh. Henry, no.
There'll be time for that later.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.402
[Henry]  I love it
when you call me Father.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.320
That's right.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.072
-[Henry]  I... I...
-[grunts]

19:59.448 --> 20:04.620
[Henry]  I love you, Fatheeeeeer...
[powers down]

20:04.703 --> 20:09.082
Shh. It's okay. It's over now.
It's all over. [pants]

20:09.791 --> 20:11.043
Oh, man.

20:13.921 --> 20:14.838
[grunts]

20:15.172 --> 20:16.006
Okay.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.094
[Princess Carolyn chuckles] Aw.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.931
She's beautiful.
What are you gonna call her?

20:24.014 --> 20:26.558
Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.144
But not really, though, right?

20:32.064 --> 20:35.734
Hey, do you think my cactus is gonna be
okay if I'm not there for six weeks?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.612
Yeah, I think
your cactus is gonna be okay.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.115
-Is this a mistake?
-No.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.122
Wow, it feels so weird to be eating here.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.291
So, this is what it's like
from the other side.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.960
Pickles, I took you here

20:53.043 --> 20:55.754
because I wanted you to be somewhere
you felt comfortable.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.965
Aw, that's so sweet, Mister.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.634
Because I need to talk to you
about something.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.428
Oh, no, this is really bad.
Why would you do this to me?

21:03.512 --> 21:04.763
I didn't tell you what it is.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.307
No one ever "needs to talk"
about something good!

21:07.391 --> 21:09.685
No one ever says,
"I need to talk to you: Happy Birthday"

21:09.768 --> 21:12.354
or, "I need to talk to you:
Felicity Jones hired a new stylist

21:12.437 --> 21:14.690
and her red carpet looks this season
are to die for!"

21:14.773 --> 21:17.859
Well, good news first:
Felicity Jones did hire a new stylist,

21:17.943 --> 21:20.988
but sadly,
her fashion choices just aren't popping.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.908
Oh, no! This is bad news!
Well, thank you for telling me.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.827
That isn't the thing
I was going to tell you.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.995
There's more bad news?

21:28.370 --> 21:30.914
Is it worse or not as bad
as the Felicity Jones thing?

21:30.998 --> 21:33.000
Well, it's different...

21:33.083 --> 21:35.877
Whatever it is,
we're going to get through it together.

21:36.336 --> 21:40.424
Whatever it is, I love you,
and nothing's going to change that.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.927
Nothing you say is going to make me
stop loving you, no matter what.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.929
Pickles... I...

21:46.596 --> 21:47.723
What is it?

21:49.182 --> 21:51.351
-[grunts] Will you marry me?
-[squeals]

21:56.398 --> 21:58.692
What do I say... when I go in?

21:58.775 --> 22:03.488
You say, "Hello. I am BoJack.
Horseman, obviously.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.407
You've probably heard of me.
I'm very famous.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.784
So... Sober me up, please!"

22:07.868 --> 22:09.661
What if I get sober...

22:09.745 --> 22:12.914
and I'm still the same awful person
I've always been,

22:12.998 --> 22:14.708
only more... sober?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.377
I think that is a very real possibility.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.004
-Don't be shitty.
-I'm not.

22:19.087 --> 22:22.466
Rehab is not a cure-all that's gonna
suddenly make you not an asshole.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.843
Then why are we doing this?
Let's turn around and go home.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.219
-You wanna go home?
-Is that okay?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.804
Look, you have two options.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.098
You can go back home
and try to do things your way,

22:30.182 --> 22:31.767
like you've been doing all your life,

22:32.309 --> 22:34.561
or you can see what these guys
have to offer.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.566
I don't understand
why you're being so nice to me.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.486
After everything you know about me,
all the shit I put you through.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.990
When I was in high school,
I had this friend. Abby.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.910
She was my only friend
and we did everything together,

22:49.993 --> 22:53.872
until she got adopted by the cool kids
and then she turned on me...

22:54.164 --> 22:55.290
so fast.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.835
She used every secret she knew about me,
every vulnerability.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.172
She made me miserable
my entire sophomore year.

23:02.422 --> 23:06.843
But then that summer
when her mom got sick, like really sick,

23:06.927 --> 23:10.305
and all her cool friends were off
vacationing in Martha's Vineyard,

23:10.389 --> 23:12.849
-I was there for her.
-Why?

23:12.933 --> 23:17.229
Because I'm an idiot. And it was Abby.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.899
And I hated her,
and I will never forgive her,

23:20.982 --> 23:25.237
but she needed me and...
she was my best friend and I loved her.

23:26.196 --> 23:30.617
And now... you're here, and I hate you,

23:30.992 --> 23:34.871
but you're my best friend,
and you need me.

23:35.622 --> 23:36.957
[inhales, exhales]

23:38.125 --> 23:40.710
You know what you're gonna say?
You wanna practice?

23:41.169 --> 23:44.506
I'm gonna say,
"Hello. I am BoJack Horseman.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.341
Obviously, you know who I am,

23:46.425 --> 23:49.428
because I'm very famous,
and also we called ahead.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.723
And I am here because... I need help."

24:00.522 --> 24:01.356
[chuckles]

24:11.408 --> 24:12.826
[door opens, closes]

24:20.709 --> 24:21.543
[car door closes]

24:22.210 --> 24:23.253
[sighs]

24:52.282 --> 24:55.160
[music playing]
