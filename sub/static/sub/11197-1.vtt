00:06.760 --> 00:09.760
Dial the gate Dial it now

00:16.960 --> 00:20.480
I swear, sir, I thought
they wanted to smoke a peace pipe.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

00:36.360 --> 00:37.840
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.120
- When is SG-1 due back?
- Hour and 22 minutes from now, sir.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.160
- Tell Major Carter I have a message.
- Yes, sir.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.040
Incoming wormhole.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.720
Receiving SG-1's identification code.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.240
It's a code red, sir.
Looks like they're under fire.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.280
Defence unit and medical team
to the gate room.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.240
Opening the iris.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.360
Next.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.600
I've been shot.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.000
Some sort of... tranquilliser.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.440
Steady pulse.
He's just unconscious, sir.

01:37.520 --> 01:42.320
Classify P2X-374 as unfriendly, sir.
Fairly primitive from the looks of it.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.520
I presume Captain Hagman
will need to be reassigned?

01:45.600 --> 01:49.520
- I'd say so, sir.
- We'll debrief in one hour. Dismissed.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.680
Major.

01:51.760 --> 01:56.000
I got a call this morning
from area 51. It's done.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.280
Jonas.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.040
Major. How's Colonel O'Neill?

03:31.120 --> 03:34.320
Partially torn ligament in his knee.
He'll be OK.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.360
- Captain Hagman?
- He'll make a full recovery.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.360
What does that make? Eight now?

03:39.440 --> 03:42.880
Nine, if you count the two hours
Captain Matthison lasted.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.080
Right. So there's no need
for Ancient Babylonian?

03:46.160 --> 03:50.080
Not exactly.
Do you think you can spare a few hours?

03:50.160 --> 03:53.360
- Sure. For what?
- You've been here three months.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.120
General Hammond thought
you might finally like to leave the base.

03:57.240 --> 04:01.440
Yes. That would be great.
Where we going?

04:01.560 --> 04:05.040
- Nevada.
- Clear skies, 73 degrees.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.560
There are at least
500 other channels, you know.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.200
But this one, this one is fantastic.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.120
You have all of your weather
from all over your planet right here.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.680
Even long-range forecasts.
It's like... predicting the future.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.000
- Well, there is some science involved.
- I know. What's in Nevada?

04:26.120 --> 04:29.560
- Do you like surprises?
- Sure. I love 'em.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.680
Hey, Major?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.960
How do I know what colour to wear?

04:43.720 --> 04:46.280
We call each other
every morning.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.560
I thought you'd like to see the prototype
as soon as it was completed.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.200
Wow. You're way ahead of schedule.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.920
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.720
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.800
I'm sorry?

05:24.920 --> 05:27.760
Dr Larry Murphy, Colonel Jack O'Neill.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.760
This is Teal'c. This is Jonas Quinn, the
man who introduced us to the naquadria.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.520
Pleasure to meet you.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.120
In case there was some doubt
about what I was just saying- no.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.520
I'm sorry. To what exactly?

05:41.600 --> 05:45.520
O'Neill believes you are going
to request that we test-fly this aircraft.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.640
Of course. Sir, I wasn't around for it,

05:48.760 --> 05:52.720
but we're all familiar with your experience
with the X-302's predecessor.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.240
Are you, now? Really?

05:55.360 --> 05:58.800
Well, sir, I can tell you that
this is a very different ship.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.240
Sir, the X-301 was a modified glider.
Now, while many of the 302's systems

06:04.360 --> 06:08.240
were retroengineered from
Goa'uld technology, it is human built.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.040
So was the Titanic.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.240
This could be the most important
breakthrough for Earth

06:14.320 --> 06:16.720
since the discovery of the Stargate.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.200
- Why's that?
- It has four sets of engines-

06:19.280 --> 06:23.680
air-breathing jets, modified aerospikes
for high altitude, and a rocket booster.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.600
You said four, right?

06:25.720 --> 06:29.240
The fourth engine is
a hyperspace-window generator.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.240
Even Goa'uld gliders
can't enter hyperspace.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.600
They're too small to carry
the Goa'uld version of the generator.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.200
Ours are much more compact.
- Because of the naquadria.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.600
Jonas, this was possible because of you.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.000
It's still a few weeks away from a practical
test, but all indications look good.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.160
If this performs the way it should,

06:48.240 --> 06:53.760
the X-302 will be the first human-built
spacecraft capable of interstellar travel.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.040
The deal made by our...

07:01.120 --> 07:05.120
I am aware of every aspect
of the arrangement, Colonel.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.200
Jack, come in.

07:10.280 --> 07:16.160
Colonel, you know Colonel Chekov,
the Russian envoy to the SGC.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.400
We've met.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.720
Colonel Chekov feels that
as a symbol of our joint efforts,

07:20.800 --> 07:24.160
a Russian officer
should be assigned to join SG-1.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.560
Over my rotting corpse, sir.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.000
Colonel?

07:31.280 --> 07:34.080
I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?

07:34.200 --> 07:38.160
I said I would discuss it with you
and that you would give it careful thought.

07:38.280 --> 07:42.640
And that I will, General.
But I'm still pretty sure I'll say "Bite me."

07:44.520 --> 07:46.800
Colonel, would you excuse us?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.720
General.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.160
So sorry.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.160
I'm sorry, General. You know
I mean no disrespect toward you.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.600
I know. I should have reprimanded you
in front of the colonel,

08:07.720 --> 08:10.160
but I agree with
your sentiments in this case.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.760
Who decided every team
has to have four people?

08:13.840 --> 08:15.680
No one says they do.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.160
But Daniel Jackson provided SG-1 with
invaluable knowledge, linguistic skills,

08:20.280 --> 08:23.600
and, in my opinion,
a very beneficial viewpoint.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.320
One I think is important
enough to replace.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.520
- But not with a Russian.
- I agree.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.520
But my patience is starting
to wear thin on this matter.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.640
I think I've given you a great deal
of latitude lately, given the situation.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.480
- Sir...
- Jack.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.919
You're off the mission list anyway
until that knee fully heals.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.360
Use the time to try
and get some perspective.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.040
Find someone qualified
you can work with.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.520
I'll have all available personnel files
forwarded to you. Dismissed.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.960
Yes, sir.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.040
- Major.
- Yeah?

09:07.160 --> 09:10.760
I realised I never actually thanked you
for letting me see the X-302.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.240
Well, General Hammond
ordered me to invite you.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.560
I'm glad the naquadria's gonna be useful.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.440
- Yeah, looks that way.
- Can I see the plans for it?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.600
Yeah.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.800
Hammond says I should give you what
you want regarding the naquadria, so...

09:25.880 --> 09:27.680
He's a man of his word.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.480
I doubt it'll mean much to you
without an understanding of our science.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.800
Maybe you can recommend
some related reading.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.800
Yeah, sure. I'll type up a list.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.440
Great. Thanks.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.840
You know, Major... I'm as physically fit
as anybody on this base,

09:47.960 --> 09:51.200
and I've committed to memory
almost all of Dr Jackson's work.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.080
Everything?

09:52.200 --> 09:56.960
According to the tests, I am able to learn
much quicker than the average human.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.120
All very interesting, but...

09:59.240 --> 10:02.320
I wanna join you, explore other planets,

10:02.400 --> 10:07.080
discover new worlds, new cultures,
help rid the galaxy of the Goa'uld.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.120
I get the picture.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.720
I can't stay here the rest of my life.
I can't go back to my planet.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.160
They don't realise the threat.
I can help them by helping you.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.040
I can also help finish
what Dr Jackson started.

10:19.120 --> 10:24.480
Jonas... I understand
why you wanna join SG-1.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.640
And I'm sorry, but...
I just don't see it happening.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.280
He trusts you.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.160
I believe it is you he must learn to trust.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.520
How can he learn to trust me
if he won't even speak to me?

10:59.640 --> 11:04.720
He holds me responsible
for what happened to... Dr Jackson.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.840
I believe you are correct.

11:11.480 --> 11:16.400
How can I even begin to make up for it
if he won't give me the chance?

11:21.200 --> 11:24.000
- This really a sport on this planet?
- Are you injured?

11:24.120 --> 11:25.920
Lt'll take more than that.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.840
Tell you what, if I knock you down,
you gotta talk to Colonel O'Neill for me.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.640
OK.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.560
I'm OK. I wasn't ready.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.800
I'm ready now.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.320
Little snack?

12:14.680 --> 12:19.040
The universities of this great nation
are getting lax in their admissions.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.040
To whom are you referring?

12:21.160 --> 12:24.760
I can be as diplomatic
and open-minded as anyone.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.840
Hammond is insisting SG-1
needs a sociopolitical nerd

12:27.920 --> 12:31.200
to offset our overwhelming coolness.

12:31.320 --> 12:34.080
Have you considered Jonas Quinn?

12:34.200 --> 12:38.160
Now, I know you've been practising,
but I still can't tell.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.880
Is that a joke?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.280
He wishes to fight against the Goa'uld.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.600
He's an ali...

12:47.440 --> 12:49.760
...en.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.640
He's an alien.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.720
I don't think we need
someone else on the team.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.040
You, Carter and I can
handle things just fine.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.240
- You learned to trust me, O'Neill.
- That's different.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.480
I do not believe it is.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.520
Like me, Jonas Quinn
may be an alien to this world,

13:07.600 --> 13:09.880
but he is committed to the Tauri's cause.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.280
That doesn't mean I want him
watching my back in battle, OK?

13:13.400 --> 13:16.480
Unscheduled incoming traveller.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.000
Bra'tac, what's up?

13:29.200 --> 13:30.880
Tek matte, Master Bra'tac.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.880
I am sorry I did not come sooner, Teal'c.
Drey'auc is gravely ill.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.960
No need to ask. Go.

13:42.960 --> 13:46.800
- I didn't know he had a wife.
- Yeah. And a son, Rya'c.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.480
They were banished from their home
on Chulak when Teal'c defected.

13:50.560 --> 13:54.320
At one point, Apophis brainwashed Rya'c
and tried to use him against us.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.160
- Bra'tac's been looking out for them.
- Why didn't Teal'c bring them here?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.520
Drey'auc wanted
to stay with her own people,

14:00.640 --> 14:03.840
and Teal'c was away on missions
most of the time anyway.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.960
He tries to get home as often he can,
but it's not easy for him.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.320
- You'd never know.
- Teal'c's not exactly an open book.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.880
Still, I'm usually better at reading people.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.480
Major

14:14.600 --> 14:16.960
Why was I not informed about the X-302?

14:17.080 --> 14:22.480
For example, it might not be that obvious
to everyone, but he is actually very upset.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.320
How did you find out about the X-302?

14:26.440 --> 14:29.440
That is not the issue.
Article 3A clearly states...

14:29.560 --> 14:31.840
The X-302 has nothing
to do with the Stargate.

14:31.960 --> 14:36.160
The naquadria being used to power
the hyperspace-window generator was...

14:36.280 --> 14:39.440
- Unauthorised incoming wormhole.
- What now?

14:39.560 --> 14:42.320
I'll take anything over this.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.840
We're not receiving an IDC, sir.
In fact, there's nothing, sir.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.440
What's up?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.760
Apparently, nothing.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.240
- Nothing?
- So it would seem.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.560
- That's a twist.
- Gate's functioning.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.200
- We're looking at an incoming wormhole.
- But nothing is incoming?

15:13.320 --> 15:16.920
- As far as I can tell.
- The Goa'uld used that tactic before.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.000
To block our escape while
they attacked in ships. Yeah.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.680
Nothing from deep-space watch either.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.720
This doesn't make any sense.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.840
To keep a wormhole open,
you have to send something through -

15:29.920 --> 15:31.920
a radio signal, anything.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.240
We're getting... nothing.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.520
- Figure it out, Major. I'll call the president.
- Yes, sir.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.480
Don't look at me. I got nothin'.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.400
As you see, conditions are harsh.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.840
But they have been safe here.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.160
They must be moved
to the new outpost built by the Tauri.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.640
All Jaffa who support
our cause are welcome.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.280
Drey'auc is in
no state to be moved.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.040
Why did you wait?

16:09.120 --> 16:12.480
As it is, I have brought
you here against her wishes.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.960
She has always been proud.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.360
She refused to accept the new symbiote.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.120
- Was one procured?
- No.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.600
She did not wish us to sacrifice
the life of another Jaffa to save her own,

16:29.680 --> 16:33.440
even one who still foolishly
worshipped the false gods.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.920
- We would all choose the same.
- In the past...

16:36.040 --> 16:42.000
It is not the past. The dissent we have
bred has brought about many changes.

16:42.120 --> 16:46.720
The Goa'uld no longer trust the Jaffa
priests with their young as they once did.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.840
Rya'c.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.800
You dare show your face here?

16:59.240 --> 17:01.800
She's dead because of you.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.599
- Could it be a malfunction?
- It's possible, but highly unlikely.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.560
Chances are, somebody dialled
Earth from an offworld gate.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.200
Wrong number?

17:19.280 --> 17:21.920
Normally, the gate
shuts down after a short time

17:22.040 --> 17:25.920
if nothing's entering the event horizon
from the outgoing location.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.440
So what do we do?

17:28.520 --> 17:30.240
We wait.

17:30.320 --> 17:34.320
To my knowledge, no one's sustained
a wormhole for longer than 38 minutes.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.480
Could whoever's behind this redial
our gate just to keep us from using it?

17:38.560 --> 17:43.520
I've programmed the computer to dial
the Alpha site after the wormhole expires.

17:43.640 --> 17:49.080
We'll be able to recall our teams and
hopefully contact someone who can help.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.800
It's still on.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.680
38 minutes, give or take a few seconds.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.720
How many is a few?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.960
OK, now we have a problem.

19:19.320 --> 19:23.440
She believed in you...
in the fight you have chosen.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.360
As you once did.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.760
How long were we to live like this?
Are we all to die like she did?

19:31.880 --> 19:35.120
Nothing has changed.
The Goa'uld can be defeated.

19:35.200 --> 19:40.320
As long as we must carry symbiotes, we
will depend on the Goa'uld for our lives.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.320
We will find a way to be free.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.920
My mother will never know this freedom
you speak of. She had no choice.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.240
You brought this upon her.
You chose for the both of us.

19:56.800 --> 20:01.120
Now, as any warrior would,
I choose to avenge her death.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.800
Everything I have done
I have done for you.

20:05.920 --> 20:09.920
Then I am ashamed. For you have
done nothing but bring pain and misery

20:10.040 --> 20:13.200
and, above all,
false hope to countless Jaffa.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.400
Then fire your weapon.

20:40.480 --> 20:46.480
There's a rise in power being retained
by the gate's internal capacitors of 0.1%.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.840
While there's an open wormhole,
the value fluctuates anyway.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.400
Not for the last 12 minutes, it hasn't.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.360
Go to gate diagnostic screen four.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.880
Normal. No incoming energy readings.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.440
Increase sensitivity by 50 per cent.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.920
What was that?

21:11.040 --> 21:15.040
Could be interference in the line
between the gate and computer.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.800
There it is again.
Increase sensitivity by 200 per cent.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.920
That's well within
the margin of error for the sensors.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.280
I know. Try it anyway.

21:30.440 --> 21:34.560
It's a small anomaly, but it could be
contributing to the power build-up.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.120
- But...
- Errors are random, Lieutenant.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.680
Whatever this is, it has a distinct pattern.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.360
Right.

21:47.360 --> 21:51.520
Fight Or do you not consider me
a worthy opponent?

21:55.600 --> 21:59.760
You should be glad he does not,
for if he did, he would snap you in half.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.720
You have become skilled, Rya'c,

22:02.800 --> 22:06.240
but a true Jaffa warrior
does not let grief cloud his judgment.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.440
I choose my opponent
as foolishly as he chose his.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.560
Teal'c chose your mother's fate
no more than he chose his own.

22:12.680 --> 22:17.520
- We are all victims of the Goa'uld.
- No, Master Bra'tac. Rya'c is correct.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.640
I have failed both he and his mother.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.800
The boy passes judgment without
having fought a single battle. Hm?

22:24.920 --> 22:29.120
Fighting a war that appears unwinnable
does not make one's cause less noble.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.320
He cares more for dying
than for his own flesh and blood.

22:32.440 --> 22:36.400
So must all Jaffa, if any of us
are ever to taste freedom.

22:49.920 --> 22:54.640
We've detected an energy build-up. It's
being transmitted through the wormhole.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.560
Our sensors aren't calibrated
to measure something this small.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.120
- The iris appears to be holding.
- Yes, sir.

23:01.200 --> 23:06.040
It's likely slowing the energy transfer,
but it's not stopping it completely.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.360
- Doesn't sound so bad.
- Actually, sir, it is.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.160
The gate itself is
one giant superconductor,

23:12.280 --> 23:14.960
capable of absorbing
huge amounts of energy.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.640
If that capacity is exceeded,
the naqahdah the Stargate's made up of

23:18.720 --> 23:21.120
will become charged and could explode.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.040
How long?

23:23.120 --> 23:26.480
A few days, maybe less.
We're calculating it right now.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.960
Is there any good news?

23:30.280 --> 23:32.880
Just bad and worse, sir.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.680
We're talking about a blast
2,000 to 3,000 megatons.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.480
Enough to take out Colorado.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.960
The resulting environmental effects
could destroy all life on Earth.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
There's worse?

23:47.640 --> 23:49.840
We have no idea how to stop it.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.040
Shel mak. Shel assah.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.400
Let him mourn.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.360
- He has grown to hate me.
- He does not.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.240
Nor does he truly believe
our cause is futile.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.440
Drey'auc would not allow it.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.880
Why does he speak as he does?

25:15.120 --> 25:16.960
Self-doubt.

25:17.040 --> 25:21.960
Since the day Apophis brainwashed him,
he has believed his own mind is weak.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.920
It is not true.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.920
You were no different at his age.

25:26.040 --> 25:30.240
After the death of your father
at the hands of Cronus,

25:30.360 --> 25:32.920
fear almost consumed you.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.040
Like Rya'c, it was desire for vengeance
that gave you strength.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.640
- Rya'c misplaces his blame.
- He directs his malice towards you

25:40.760 --> 25:44.000
because he believes you doubt him
as much as he doubts himself.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.800
Why would he believe such a thing?

25:47.960 --> 25:52.320
Because you are his father and
you have not told him otherwise.

26:47.480 --> 26:52.320
Not so long ago...
I was captured in battle,

26:53.920 --> 26:56.720
and Apophis took control of my mind.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.200
He made me believe that
I was once again his loyal first prime.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.320
And I turned on my friends
who trusted me.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.280
Were it not for Bra'tac
and the rite of M'al Sharran,

27:11.360 --> 27:15.760
I would have died...
believing that Apophis was my god.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.200
Whether you believe in me
or what I have chosen to do

27:25.280 --> 27:29.920
does not change the fact that
I have never doubted your heart, Rya'c.

27:31.960 --> 27:36.960
You need never win back my trust,
my son, for you have never lost it.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.160
- Shouldn't we cut power?
- Won't do any good.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.200
Incoming wormholes
draw their energy from the offworld.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.400
Major Carter wants
to monitor the gate through feedback.

27:58.520 --> 28:03.520
We can't use the Russian gate because
there's already an established wormhole.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.760
Energy build-up has reached 18 per cent.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.160
There has to be a way
to drain the capacitors.

28:15.280 --> 28:19.440
- Still sexy as ever, I see.
- What are you doing here?

28:19.520 --> 28:23.760
There's no point in building naqahdah
reactors for Russia if there's no Russia.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.960
The Pentagon thought
you might need some help.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.800
Not from you.

28:28.880 --> 28:34.240
OK. Well, then, I'll get a coffee
and a doughnut and wait for the big bang.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.760
- That's just what I needed.
- Major.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.920
Carter.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.840
This wouldn't be a problem
if you had a working alien ship.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.280
Hey I didn't wreck it. The Goa'uld did.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.720
And we barely escaped with our lives.

28:50.840 --> 28:54.520
What good is being a part of this
so-called Protected Planets Treaty

28:54.640 --> 28:57.040
if you can't even reach
the Asgard when attacked?

28:57.160 --> 29:01.520
Excuse me, sirs. I just got off the phone
with Dr Murphy at area 51.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.040
He says he can have the X-302
ready to go in six hours.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.360
- I thought it was weeks away from a test.
- We've tried everything else we can.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.640
Our only chance is
if we can contact the Asgard.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.440
I'd like to volunteer, sir.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.960
I'll go too, sir.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.360
- You sure you're up for it, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.680
I'll have transport prepped
and ready in 20 minutes.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.200
- Shaq'rel.
- Teal'c.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.680
- It has been too long, old friend.
- It is fortunate you are here.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.360
I have brought word to Bra'tac
so he might warn you.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.600
- Of what?
- The Tauri are in danger.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.120
They are under attack from Anubis.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.520
- I assume you were briefed?
- Briefly.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.680
The target is Abydos,
the closest planet with a Stargate.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.760
You know our simulations for opening the
hyperspace window were done in space?

30:55.880 --> 31:00.000
- We have to leave the atmosphere.
- We have to leave the ground first.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.520
- It'll fly, Colonel. I bet my life on it.
- Wanna come with?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.960
Love to, but I'm needed here.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.200
Yes. Yes, you are.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.280
Even if we do manage
to contact the Asgard,

31:19.400 --> 31:21.840
there's a chance
they won't be able to help us.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.720
What's your point, Carter?

31:24.840 --> 31:27.760
I guess I don't have one beyond that, sir.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.840
Thank you.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.640
- You're missing the point.
- Can I have a minute?

31:38.760 --> 31:41.520
I wish I had one.
Carter and O'Neill are taking off.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.160
- That's what this is about.
- What do you mean?

31:44.240 --> 31:48.000
I'm no scientist, but I have studied
all the research done on naquadria,

31:48.120 --> 31:51.360
and Carter allowed me to see
the specifications on the X-302.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.840
- And?
- It's not gonna work.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.440
Really? That's just what I was saying.
Who are you?

31:57.520 --> 32:00.880
- Jonas Quinn.
- The alien with the wacky naqahdah.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.240
Naquadria. You are?

32:03.360 --> 32:06.000
McKay. Scientist. Earth.

32:07.800 --> 32:11.920
General... the instability of the naquadria

32:12.040 --> 32:16.480
increases exponentially as you attempt
to extract more energy out of it.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.560
This is even worse than I thought.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.760
- If you allow this test to proceed...
- This is not a test.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.480
If the X-302 fails,
this planet will be destroyed.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.680
- I understand your position.
- It's not just my position.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.720
You stand to suffer the consequences
with everyone else.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.320
If either of you have a more prudent
suggestion on halting this crisis,

32:34.440 --> 32:36.240
I'm willing to hearing it.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.120
Otherwise, I suggest
we all cross our fingers

32:39.200 --> 32:42.880
and hope Major Carter
and Colonel O'Neill can reach help.

32:46.960 --> 32:51.800
- Cross our fingers?
- An expression of desire for good luck.

32:51.920 --> 32:54.360
- Really?
- It's ridiculous, huh?

33:08.840 --> 33:11.600
- Navigation.
- Check.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.480
Oxygen pressure. Temperature control.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.000
- All check.
- Inertial dampeners.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.000
Cool. And check.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.600
- Engines.
- All check.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.560
- Phasers?
- Sorry, sir. All systems operational.

33:37.760 --> 33:42.640
Too bad we can't drive across
the galaxy. This handles like a Cadillac.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.040
Colonel, Major, this is Hammond.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.240
Jonas Quinn has voiced
some concern about this mission

33:48.360 --> 33:51.440
regarding the instability of the naquadria.

33:51.520 --> 33:56.000
Sir, the simulations we ran
anticipated every conceivable scenario.

33:56.120 --> 33:59.120
It's the inconceivable ones
I'm concerned about.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.600
The X-302 has hundreds
of safety mechanisms

34:01.720 --> 34:05.040
to compensate for anything
that can go wrong.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.080
Arming ejection system.

34:08.159 --> 34:11.040
That's good, that's good. That's funny.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.880
Mission Command,
all systems go, from Abydos One.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.159
Copy that, Abydos One.
Good luck.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.080
Well... here we go.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.120
- We have liftoff.
- Climbing.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.960
Velocity approaching Mach 2.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.880
10,000 metres.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.120
- Mach 3.
- Mission Command, over.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.600
- Looks good from here, Abydos One.
- Abydos One, over.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.880
Anubis has a weapon that uses
one Stargate to destroy another.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.280
If my information is correct,
the attack has already begun.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.240
- We cannot warn them.
- That is why I brought a ship.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.520
If the attack has begun,
a warning will do little good.

35:21.640 --> 35:25.440
- We must find a way to stop it.
- I do not know the weapon's location.

35:25.560 --> 35:30.320
Anubis has grown powerful, but still
only defends a small handful of planets.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.040
If one of those Stargates
cannot be contacted...

35:33.160 --> 35:36.640
It is most likely the origin of the attack.

35:36.720 --> 35:41.120
Let us hope it is one of the planets
to which I can remember the sequence.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.640
Preparing for main rocket-engine burn.

35:49.720 --> 35:54.720
Roger that. We'll re-establish
contact after you exit the atmosphere.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.160
Engaging rocket engine.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.520
This is Abydos One.
Do you read?

36:23.600 --> 36:25.760
Loud and clear, Abydos One.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.600
Altitude- 500 kilometres and rising.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.360
Velocity- 40,000 kilometres per hour.

36:33.600 --> 36:37.360
I'm entering the coordinates
in the hyperspace generator.

36:39.560 --> 36:44.160
- Roger that, Abydos One.
- Godspeed, Colonel, Major, from us all.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.800
Thank you, sir.

36:46.880 --> 36:50.880
- Let's do this.
- Engaging hyperspace window.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.840
Abydos One, do you read?
We're still receiving your radio signal.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.560
- Carter?
- I don't know, sir.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.360
Mission Command,
we missed the window.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.880
Please explain.

37:14.960 --> 37:20.560
The autopilot engaged and we veered
off course. Should we try again?

37:20.640 --> 37:25.640
Negative. Return to base for
further evaluation. Mission failure.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.360
I hate hearing that.

37:39.160 --> 37:43.120
Colonel, Major. Glad to see you're OK.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.560
For the moment, sir.

37:45.680 --> 37:50.120
They're still analysing the flight data
recorder, but it looks like a 605-3 error.

37:50.200 --> 37:54.480
- Forgive me?
- It's the one after 605-2, sir.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.720
The X-302 couldn't get a lock
on its destination, so it auto-aborted.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.680
It's one of the built-in safety features.

38:03.800 --> 38:07.040
- What went wrong?
- The hyperspace window was unstable.

38:07.120 --> 38:12.000
We thought we'd compensated for the
energy fluctuations, but apparently not.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.480
I don't think you can.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.880
Apparently, Carter and I
could have been torn asunder.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.800
The possibility was remote.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.600
More likely is transportation
to an unknown location

38:23.680 --> 38:26.720
with limited fuel, oxygen,
and no way of getting back.

38:26.840 --> 38:31.040
- Can this problem be resolved?
- We don't understand why it exists yet.

38:31.160 --> 38:36.320
You're lucky. There's no telling what
an unstable hyperspace window could do.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.040
The bottom line is, we're on our own.

38:45.160 --> 38:49.880
Hey. How come you're not downstairs
with the rest of the eggheads?

38:49.960 --> 38:53.280
Not that you're... an egghead.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.600
Well, you are, actually.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.480
But in a good way.

39:03.840 --> 39:08.800
I couldn't think down there. They all
kept looking at me for the answer.

39:08.920 --> 39:14.240
Well, you do have a penchant for
pulling brilliant ideas out of your butt.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.640
Head.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.600
Out of your head, when we need them.

39:19.680 --> 39:23.120
- Not this time.
- You've still got two days to work on it.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.640
Sir, I don't think I could solve this
if I had a couple of years.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.120
Carter, am I sensing fear in your voice?

39:29.200 --> 39:33.640
- Yes, actually. A lot of fear.
- Well, stop it. You're making me nervous.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.360
What about you, sir? Any ideas?

39:36.440 --> 39:41.360
I mean, sometimes you have a way
of seeing things at... at their simplest.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.600
Thank you.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.360
I'm gonna go eat some cake.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.840
Think I'll join you.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.240
We're experiencing
a widespread loss of power, sir.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.200
I am Anubis.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.120
Looks like a hologram projection.

40:30.240 --> 40:35.920
Humans of the Tauri,
your end of days finally approaches.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.880
There will be no mercy.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.960
Come on. Who talks like that?

40:44.040 --> 40:48.120
Sir, this is Asgard technology.
He must have downloaded it from Thor.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.440
You will bow to my awesome power.

40:51.560 --> 40:56.360
There is nothing that can stop
the destruction I bring upon you.

40:56.440 --> 41:00.400
Prepare to meet your doom.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.800
Oh, please

41:14.760 --> 41:16.640
