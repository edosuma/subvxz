“I leave my estate to the
only honest man I ever met,”

00:08.208 --> 00:09.710
“Dominic Santini.”

00:10.943 --> 00:12.252
Dom, hey, what's wrong?

00:12.312 --> 00:13.757
Just hang on.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.255
…to walk away and not say anything

00:17.317 --> 00:18.955
when we're forced to contest the Will.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.562
Assault formation. We're going in.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.767
3 to 1 odds, Dom.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:53.447 --> 01:57.224
Doctors General, this is Mercy 1
leaving Point Discovery.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.158
ETA your location, 1 hour.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.168
Roger, Mercy 1. What is
the condition of your cargo?

02:05.592 --> 02:08.663
Staying cool, and in real good condition.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.731
Roger, Mercy 1 and I thank you.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.435
We have the red carpet out for you.

02:12.499 --> 02:13.978
Good luck on your flight.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.513
Over and out.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.054
Graydon, I'm gonna be 2
hours late for the meeting.

02:26.113 --> 02:29.026
I won't have time to notify
everyone on the board, Mr. Barron.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.686
They can wait for me then.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.356
Maybe they'll think of something
creative for a change.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.701
I'll tell them that.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.499
Do so. This is Barron 1, clear.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.117
Hey, what's that?

03:28.608 --> 03:31.817
Oh, I don't believe this, Be
with you in a minute, buddy.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.853
Okay, buddy?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.987
Except for a bruised ego, yes.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.690
Come on.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.457
What is this thing you're flying?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.726
That's the taxi that's
gonna get you outta here.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.135
Come on.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.002
I thought my company was on the
cutting edge of technology.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.240
Oh? You an engineer?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.078
Sort of.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.143
My name's Dominic Santini.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.447
Carl Barron.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.081
The Carl Barron?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.822
Well, I'll be.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.022
I want you to change course for Los Angeles.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.066
I'd like to oblige you, Mr. Barron,

04:48.155 --> 04:50.294
but I got a human heart back there.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.064
There's a team of doctors in Chicago

04:52.125 --> 04:55.299
waiting to transplant it into the
chest of a 16-year-old kid.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.535
But I've got to get to LA.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.407
$25,000 for you to change your flight plan.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.770
Maybe you didn't hear me.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.315
I said I got a human heart…

05:04.371 --> 05:06.476
Maybe you didn't hear me.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.813
$50,000 to Los Angeles, one way.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.515
I heard.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.893
And I don't believe what I heard.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.758
I guess what they say about you is true.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.664
Oh? What do they say?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.595
That you got a heart as cold as a snake.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.536
My temperature is my own business.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.938
And my flight plan is mine.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.976
You're going to Chicago, pal.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.706
Mr. Archangel, the House Oversight Committee

05:38.772 --> 05:41.719
has brought to our attention
your payments to Santini Air.

05:41.775 --> 05:46.781
Santini Air provides transportation
and surveillance services.

05:48.815 --> 05:51.318
2 men who have the most
intimate knowledge of Airwolf,

05:51.384 --> 05:52.829
still work for the Firm.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.890
Because we need people we can trust.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.533
There's no mystery.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.697
Sir, you are testifying before a Committee

06:00.760 --> 06:03.434
which represents the people
of the United States!

06:03.496 --> 06:05.840
We deserve forthright answers to our questions.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.142
Then ask questions, Mr. Younger!

06:09.202 --> 06:11.978
All you have are innuendos and rumors!

06:15.242 --> 06:19.554
Your story belongs in the
check-out line at a supermarket.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.722
There you go, Mr. Barron, you're almost home.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.534
Chicago and back, in only…

06:40.634 --> 06:42.944
My God man, you must have flown almost Mach 1.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.346
In a helicopter?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.111
Miracles never cease, do they?

06:46.172 --> 06:48.083
I don't understand, you
could have taken my offer,

06:48.141 --> 06:51.714
made $50,000, and still got
the heart to Chicago on time.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.088
It's a matter of priorities.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.455
$50,000 isn't one of them.

06:56.516 --> 07:00.123
Money is the grease which makes the
world go round, there's no denying it.

07:00.186 --> 07:03.497
Except that sometimes
money gets in peoples' way.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.968
That's mine. I built it from the ground up.

07:12.732 --> 07:16.737
Suits your personality, steel and concrete.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.590
Steel and concrete, huh?

07:42.729 --> 07:45.767
Thanks Santini, for the rescue,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.371
for everything.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.724
I'm telling you, it was $50 grand!

08:09.823 --> 08:12.770
He offered me $50 grand in cash!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.271
Carl Barron?

08:14.527 --> 08:16.438
The richest man in the world?

08:17.797 --> 08:20.676
So help me, it was him! I swear it, String.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.476
But you got the heart to Chicago General first?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.013
Hey, what do you take me for?

08:26.072 --> 08:28.416
I take you for Dominic Santini.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.612
This is

09:31.971 --> 09:36.716
my last Will

09:37.544 --> 09:41.686
and Testament.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.704
Good evening, Mr. Barron.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.176
Good evening, George.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.543
I'll be working in the Plasma Lab tonight.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.843
Yes, sir. Just let me know when you're through.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.140
I'll do that.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.802
Mr. Barron!

10:35.768 --> 10:37.748
Oh! Oh, my God!

10:38.738 --> 10:40.183
Mr. Barron!

10:40.840 --> 10:42.251
Mr. Barron!

10:59.392 --> 11:02.601
Carl Barron's legacy was
to the future of mankind.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.675
He was the embodiment of a self-made man.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.004
He was a self-reliant man.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.938
Now I know that Barron Technology

11:10.003 --> 11:11.641
will remain a part of the family tradition

11:11.704 --> 11:16.084
as long as his granddaughter, Margo
Brewster, has anything to do with it.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.746
And I also know that

11:17.810 --> 11:20.916
we'll offer her all the support that she needs

11:20.980 --> 11:23.324
in this difficult time of transition.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.455
Thank you.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.641
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me, please.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.376
I'm sorry.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.079
My name's Charles Selkirk,
I'm Mr. Barron's attorney.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.049
Before this tragic accident,

11:47.106 --> 11:50.110
Mr. Barron made out a new
Will in his own handwriting.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.622
He requested that it be read at his funeral.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.390
See, I told you he was a weird duck.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.190
I guess that's why he liked you, huh, Dom?

11:59.185 --> 12:01.131
Now, just a second please.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.526
Just a second.

12:06.593 --> 12:10.097
“I don't believe in a lot of legal
jargon, so I'll get right to it.”

12:10.163 --> 12:13.269
“My homes and other real property
I leave to my granddaughter,”

12:13.333 --> 12:14.812
“Margo Brewster.”

12:14.901 --> 12:17.108
“The remainder of my estate, will be divided.”

12:17.170 --> 12:19.377
“60% to Margo Brewster,”

12:19.439 --> 12:23.444
“the remaining 40%, I leave to
the only honest man I ever met,”

12:23.977 --> 12:25.581
“Dominic Santini.”

12:27.380 --> 12:30.623
Just a second, please. Please let me continue.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.560
Please, ladies and gentleman.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.694
“Even though he was flying a secret,”

12:35.755 --> 12:38.634
“advanced-design helicopter
on a mission of mercy,”

12:38.691 --> 12:41.968
“he stopped to save me when my
plane crashed in the wilderness”

12:42.028 --> 12:44.235
“and refused any reward.”

12:44.297 --> 12:48.006
“In my life, I always suspected
the motives of a Good Samaritan.”

12:48.101 --> 12:51.548
“In death, I reward at least this one.”

12:55.108 --> 12:58.646
The guest register indicates
that Mr. Santini is present.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.487
Mr. Santini, would you
please identify yourself?

13:01.547 --> 13:02.890
Please.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.919
There he is. There he is.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.293
That's him?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.072
How long have you known Carl Barron?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.701
I just met him one time.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.007
What is the future of Barron Technology?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.014
Are you going to be splitting
it up, Miss Brewster?

13:24.070 --> 13:26.277
I don't know. I haven't had
the time to think about that.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.216
Miss Brewster, what do you
think about your grandfather

13:28.274 --> 13:30.550
giving 40% of the company
to a complete stranger?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.647
I'm sorry. I can't answer
that question right now.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.591
Mr. Santini, what was that that
Barron said about a super helicopter?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.093
Well, I…

13:37.150 --> 13:39.061
You must have some reaction
to that, Miss Brewster.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.597
Yes, yes, tell us.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.133
Please, leave me alone! All
of you, just leave me alone!

13:54.834 --> 13:57.371
Dominic Santini, owner of Santini Air,

13:57.437 --> 14:00.384
is the windfall recipient
of Carl Barron's estate,

14:00.473 --> 14:02.077
estimated to be in the vicinity

14:02.141 --> 14:04.712
of $100 million.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.355
Right.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.054
Put him through.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.028
Yes, Mr. Younger.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.831
That's quite a tale, don't you think?

14:17.890 --> 14:20.029
Canada, to Chicago, to Los Angeles

14:20.093 --> 14:22.869
in an advanced chopper
flown by Dominic Santini.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.666
I think it's preposterous.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.343
There's a public committee meeting in 10 days.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.038
You'd better have an explanation.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.112
What was he doing flying Airwolf?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.987
Hey, I was sick with the flu.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.626
Well, it's an incredible breech of security.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.260
I did it because some kid needed a new heart!

14:46.319 --> 14:48.162
I'm talking about Barron!

14:48.221 --> 14:50.929
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Let him freeze to death?

14:51.858 --> 14:54.395
You would have done the same thing,

14:55.027 --> 14:56.404
I think.

14:57.263 --> 14:58.606
Maybe…

14:59.165 --> 15:02.578
maybe if you said the man was
delirious when you picked him up.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.415
Dominic's in that Will
because he's an honest man.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.882
Now you want him to lie?

15:06.939 --> 15:10.284
Besides, if Barron's state-of-mind
comes into contest,

15:10.977 --> 15:12.513
Dom could lose the whole thing.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.354
Right, don't worry Michael,
you'll think of something.

15:19.986 --> 15:23.627
Dominic Santini, with $40 million,

15:24.590 --> 15:27.161
what a terrifying prospect!

15:32.865 --> 15:35.778
It's just like my grandfather
to do something like this.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.615
He was always good at messing
up other peoples' lives.

15:40.039 --> 15:43.248
Look, I'm positive that Carl
wouldn't give Santini anything.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.515
It was a hoax.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.848
Are you sure?

15:50.783 --> 15:54.026
You just wait and see how
fast he takes our offer.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.891
And then you're going to have everything.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.439
What will I do with it?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.806
That's why I'm here, darling.

16:08.434 --> 16:12.075
Oh James, you've always been so sweet

16:12.905 --> 16:14.350
and helpful.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.318
Oh, Margo.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.916
Are you going to ask me to marry you again?

16:24.684 --> 16:26.686
I guess, I don't give up easily, huh?

16:30.690 --> 16:33.364
Jim, I'm so confused about all of this.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.300
I'm just a preschool teacher.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.173
I don't…

16:39.131 --> 16:40.804
I need more time.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.115
I won't rush you.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.486
You know what… funny about time.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.688
You believe you have plenty of it

16:54.480 --> 16:57.086
until something like this happens.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.623
Now,

17:00.052 --> 17:03.966
I'll never be able to tell my
grandfather what was in my heart.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.450
Water into gasoline. We'll corner the market.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.291
Well, what are we going to drink?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.762
Hey, Dom, come here.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.598
Margo Brewster, Carl Barron's
heir and granddaughter,

17:42.662 --> 17:45.939
eluded reporters outside the
preschool where she teaches.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.978
Her resignation from the school fuels rumors…

17:48.034 --> 17:49.638
Poor kid. At least I'm used to craziness.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.012
…as head of Barron's Industry,

17:52.071 --> 17:55.245
a multi-billion-dollar international
conglomeration founded by her grandfather…

17:55.308 --> 17:56.719
Santini Air.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.119
Hello, Mr. Hawke.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.920
This is Graydon. I'm outside,
I'd like to see you.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.085
…who was killed by a sudden…

18:03.149 --> 18:04.184
Okay.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.890
…and still unexplained explosion
in the Barron Industry laboratories,

18:06.953 --> 18:08.296
early this week. It is assumed…

18:08.821 --> 18:11.392
We've got visitors, outside in a limo.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.061
…if Miss Barron chooses to
exercise her voting stock…

18:28.941 --> 18:31.547
Well, that's quite a little circus
you have there, Mr. Santini.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.386
I wish they'd all go away.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.925
How are you?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.694
They will. This bubble won't last forever.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.556
What bubble?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.794
Mr. Santini, somebody's played
a very cruel joke on you,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.426
and we feel badly about it.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.402
Those of us who are close to the Barron family,

18:47.460 --> 18:50.669
we'd like you to come away with
something a little more than just…

18:51.197 --> 18:52.699
circus memories.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.373
Just how bad do you feel, Mr. Graydon?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.616
Say, 7 figures?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.387
$500,000

19:07.446 --> 19:09.448
to walk away and not say anything

19:09.515 --> 19:11.722
when we're forced to contest the Will.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.161
Why would I do that?

19:13.219 --> 19:16.757
Because over half that $40
million is in BTS stock, Dom.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.865
Those guys are worried about their jobs.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.602
We want to save Mr. Santini some embarrassment.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.674
And we also want to retain family control

19:26.732 --> 19:28.609
over what's a family company.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.750
Mr. Barron put me in that Will for some reason.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.877
Take the money, Mr. Santini.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.478
I don't like being bought and sold, mister.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.455
It won't be offered again.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.890
Then I guess I blew it.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.422
I guess you did.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.824
How much of that was in Barron stock, Caitlin?

19:50.456 --> 19:52.595
A lot, over half.

19:55.394 --> 19:58.603
I'll see you in the boardroom, Mr. Graydon.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.111
You sound like a real executive there, Dom.

20:06.405 --> 20:10.148
Well listen, I've been running this
operation on a shoestring for so long,

20:10.209 --> 20:13.349
that I've gotten some practical experience.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.323
Mamma mia, I forgot.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.588
We got a gig at the studio tomorrow.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.254
Surely you don't intend to work.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.922
You're darn right!

20:20.986 --> 20:23.933
It'll make me feel like going
back to something normal again.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.371
“See him in the boardroom.”

20:32.431 --> 20:34.570
I'll see him in hell first.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.321
It's sort of an aerial ballet.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.085
I can't describe it any better.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.820
Yeah well, Dom will take you on a dry run

20:49.882 --> 20:50.986
that way you'll get the feel of it.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.656
It's the feel. That's what I'm after. The feel.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.928
You see, in order for me to
visualize what's happening,

20:56.989 --> 20:59.492
I must have the texture, the substance,

20:59.558 --> 21:01.231
the feel, as you say,

21:01.293 --> 21:05.105
in order to produce the most
dynamic possible ensemble.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.734
Yes, that's what I'm after.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.028
Hi, Dominic.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.089
Hi.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.429
Oh, hi.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.934
A stir stick for your coffee?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.735
Thanks.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.776
You'd better watch out for
the rotors on my helicopter.

21:43.836 --> 21:44.837
Oh?

21:44.937 --> 21:48.248
Yeah, the draft is liable
to give you pneumonia.

21:48.407 --> 21:51.854
You're just a big ol’ teddy bear.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.285
You know, I read about you in the paper.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.523
Oh?

22:01.687 --> 22:02.893
I think it's wonderful.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.636
Keys, Dominic?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.873
Keys?

22:13.966 --> 22:15.946
Oh!

22:16.001 --> 22:17.537
Well,

22:17.670 --> 22:18.944
not right now.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.610
You see, I'd better be gett’n to work.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.111
Well, we all have to work, don't we?

22:28.147 --> 22:29.751
Mamma mia!

22:32.451 --> 22:34.124
Healthy girl.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.127
And so sincere.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.215
Hey, I'm starting the run. You ready?

22:55.507 --> 22:57.214
I'm focused.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.273
Dom, hey, what's wrong? What happened?

23:20.466 --> 23:22.104
I'm into counter-rotation.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.655
Cut. Cut.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.554
Cut? Hell, just hang on.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.879
It's a wrap. It's a wrap.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.145
Let it be a wrap.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.210
It's a wrap.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.414
That reminds me.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.423
I better get a Will of my own.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.461
Your Uncle Anthony, sent me.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.335
Hey, he's been dead for 10 years, lady.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.567
I know.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.315
I still don't know how it happened.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.551
She'll patch, Dom.

25:14.613 --> 25:16.217
You put her down real easy.

25:17.082 --> 25:20.029
There's still no reason for
a rod to fail like that.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.965
You know, String,

25:23.355 --> 25:27.531
I wonder if being rich isn't the
first step on the road to paranoia.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.938
You might have to get used to it, Mr. Santini.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.407
The court dismissed the challenge.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.705
The validation of the handwriting was upheld.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.804
You'll soon be a wealthy man.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.673
Well, I feel better.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.977
Not because of the money.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.245
Because now they know I'm not a liar.

25:55.521 --> 25:58.593
Hangar's all buttoned up! Ready to go home?

26:00.726 --> 26:03.138
Barron Industries is having
their board meet’n tomorrow,

26:03.195 --> 26:04.833
I'm trying to make some
sense outta these reports

26:04.897 --> 26:07.400
so I won't look like a total idiot.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.610
Looks pretty thick.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.913
Like my head.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.659
You know Dom, you and I kid around a lot,

26:23.816 --> 26:25.955
trading shots and whatnot.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.722
But I'll tell you someth’n,

26:28.787 --> 26:31.324
you're one of the most intelligent men I know.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.603
And if you want to figure that out,

26:34.159 --> 26:35.797
you can do it.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.905
Thanks, String.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.649
I'm tell’n you Margo, Santini is dangerous.

26:49.708 --> 26:52.188
He thinks your grandfather gave him
this money for a special purpose.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.019
He's making noises about
shaking up this company.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.457
Now we have to be prepared
to do battle with him.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.329
Battle? Jim, you make it sound like war.

27:00.385 --> 27:01.728
It is war, Margo.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.131
Now your grandfather would have told you that.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.331
Everything was to Carl Barron,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.164
business, marriage,
children, grandchildren,

27:11.563 --> 27:13.065
all a study in tactics.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.509
I know.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.546
You thought about my proposal?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.416
Another tactic.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.816
Margo.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.449
Jim, I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

27:28.347 --> 27:32.318
It's just, I haven't decided yet.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.857
Margo, the company needs your help now.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.732
We have to fight off Santini.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.199
Now, you can wait to decide about marriage,

27:38.257 --> 27:40.794
but I have to have your proxy now.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.138
Of course.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.476
I'll do it.

27:59.711 --> 28:03.853
Now, this concludes the acquisition
profile for BTS in the last quarter.

28:04.183 --> 28:09.223
And as you can see we are a
well-balanced and diversified company.

28:09.454 --> 28:10.797
Good job, Jim.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.858
I'm disposed to give you carte blanche.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.930
Thank you. Mr. Santini, would you
like to make that unanimous?

28:18.063 --> 28:19.872
Mr. Santini,

28:19.932 --> 28:22.310
would you like to make that unanimous?

28:22.367 --> 28:23.971
What?

28:24.503 --> 28:26.449
You have read the report?

28:30.008 --> 28:34.013
It would take a Philadelphia
lawyer to figure this out,

28:34.079 --> 28:37.993
but I read it, last night, all night,

28:38.383 --> 28:40.863
and I got a couple of
problems, Mr. Graydon.

28:43.822 --> 28:48.567
It says here we charged the
United States Air Force

28:48.627 --> 28:52.200
$16,000 for sensors

28:52.264 --> 28:55.302
to go with the helicopter guidance system.

28:55.968 --> 28:59.814
Now, I know helicopters, gentlemen,

28:59.938 --> 29:02.714
and I know that those sensors

29:02.774 --> 29:06.347
shouldn't cost any more than $160.

29:07.946 --> 29:11.393
We are ripping off the American taxpayer.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.452
And you know it.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.826
Is that true?

29:19.858 --> 29:21.496
Is that true?

29:22.894 --> 29:25.534
Mr. Santini, you don't buy
these things off the rack.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.100
You have to consider research
and development costs.

29:28.166 --> 29:32.546
Research and development does not
justify this kind of a markup, sir.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.849
Now, on page 47.

29:38.310 --> 29:42.019
It shows that you're buying up a
lot of farmland in Tucker Valley.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.252
Yes.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.657
Well, I know that area, because I fly over it.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.220
I know it too, it's lovely.

29:51.123 --> 29:55.594
And what you've got there is
a lot of small family farms.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.333
Now, what I'd like to know is,

30:01.366 --> 30:03.972
are we muscling those people off their land?

30:05.537 --> 30:09.007
I'm not gonna to be cross-examined
by some throttle jockey.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.748
Now this report stands approved as presented!

30:12.878 --> 30:14.858
Not till I get these answers.

30:14.946 --> 30:17.290
You are outvoted, sir!

30:17.949 --> 30:20.327
No, he is not.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.103
Mr. Santini, you and I are
long overdue for a talk.

30:33.598 --> 30:35.544
Miss Brewster, you're on.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.176
Excuse me, gentlemen.

30:51.616 --> 30:54.825
You know, I wish I could say
I knew your grandfather,

30:55.153 --> 30:58.930
but I didn't even like him very much.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.368
You know, that's the same with me.

31:01.426 --> 31:02.700
Really?

31:02.928 --> 31:05.067
You see, after my parents died,

31:05.130 --> 31:07.804
10 years ago, a plane crash in Europe,

31:07.966 --> 31:10.469
well we, just pulled away.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.105
I don't know. A note once a year at Christmas

31:13.171 --> 31:14.616
on the back of the card,

31:14.673 --> 31:16.584
checks I never cashed…

31:17.576 --> 31:19.886
That's why I can't understand all of this.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.084
Why leave it to me?

31:22.314 --> 31:24.089
I can't manage it.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.363
Are you sure about that?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.562
You know, every big corporation
needs someone at the top

31:29.621 --> 31:31.794
with that human touch.

31:32.758 --> 31:34.328
Well, you know,

31:35.260 --> 31:39.436
you have that Barron blood in you.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.268
You could make it work.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.244
Maybe he knew that.

31:43.935 --> 31:45.937
You know, I've been trying to figure out

31:46.037 --> 31:48.540
why Carl Barron put me in his Will.

31:48.940 --> 31:51.443
I figured there must be some reason.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.489
And you know something?

31:53.745 --> 31:56.658
I think this is it, this talk we're having.

32:06.858 --> 32:08.860
Well, what should I do?

32:09.895 --> 32:11.875
Just keep watching her.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.079
Yes? Edna?

32:25.377 --> 32:28.915
Dominic Santini wants me to
meet him in the parking lot?

32:31.082 --> 32:33.688
Okay, I'll be there in 5 minutes.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.298
Thank you.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.753
You're not… oh my God!

33:26.771 --> 33:29.911
Give me Graydon. He's on the test range…

33:50.529 --> 33:51.872
Graydon.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.637
Graydon, I lost her.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.802
What, you lost her?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.938
Yeah, Santini took her up
in one of his choppers and…

33:58.370 --> 34:00.077
Look, it didn't look right.

34:00.138 --> 34:01.708
Meet me there.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.773
Look, she got into one of your
red, white and blue choppers

34:34.839 --> 34:36.512
only half an hour ago!

34:37.208 --> 34:39.051
Come ‘ere. Come ‘ere.

34:40.545 --> 34:43.617
Look at that rotor. That's my bird.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.621
Dom, doesn't Angelo do your painting?

34:46.717 --> 34:48.129
Yeah, across the runway.

34:48.186 --> 34:51.827
Cate, watch the store. Come
on, String. Let's go see Ange.

34:53.123 --> 34:54.728
He was a cash customer, Dom.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.933
I figured it was something to do with
the $40 million. A present or someth’n.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.407
But what did he look like, Angelo?

35:00.465 --> 35:02.706
Old guy, 60 at least.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.544
I don't know, important-look’n.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.214
My God!

35:07.706 --> 35:09.185
And if he's still alive, then…

35:09.240 --> 35:11.777
That's right, Santini. If
he's alive, you don't get it.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.782
Is this him?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.117
That's him.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.328
Correction.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.055
You don't get it either way. Cooper…

35:44.843 --> 35:46.186
Is there any other way outta here?

35:46.244 --> 35:47.882
No, it's all locked up, Dom.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.107
It's thinner.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.601
It's paint thinner! Cover your mouths.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.313
When the door opens Cooper,
it'll cause a spark,

36:12.370 --> 36:15.544
and then the whole place’ll go up in flames.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.544
Listen, that chopper's course was northeast.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.274
- So why don't you fly it?
- All right.

37:07.559 --> 37:12.065
Choppers Baker and Charlie, join
us over Big Bear in 15 minutes.

37:26.010 --> 37:29.014
Dom? Angelo? Are you guys here?

37:30.014 --> 37:31.459
Hawke?

37:33.852 --> 37:35.229
Hawke!

38:02.280 --> 38:04.556
Hawke! Are you all right?

38:04.682 --> 38:05.956
Dom?

38:09.554 --> 38:11.830
They had that door rigged
to blow this place up.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.027
- Barron's alive.
- What?

38:14.092 --> 38:15.537
And he's got Margo.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.938
And now, Graydon's trying to finish ‘em off.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.009
Come on, we've gotta borrow
one of your choppers.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.068
All right.

38:24.736 --> 38:25.908
Where are we going?

38:25.970 --> 38:29.008
The old seismology lab. It's
been shutdown for years.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.144
Barron knows the place, it fits.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.149
Why would he fake his own death?

38:34.245 --> 38:35.588
He didn't.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.025
He died in that plasma explosion.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.322
Margo died at the hands of her kidnappers.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.025
And we all know what happened to Santini.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.930
- The estate will be in probate for years.
- Yeah.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.470
I'll control the company.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.777
Gang’s all here.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.865
What do we do now, String?

39:16.921 --> 39:19.902
Those BTS choppers got about
an hour's head start on us.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.097
And we don't know where Margo could be.

39:22.327 --> 39:23.965
Dom, you remember the other night,

39:24.028 --> 39:26.975
we were talk’n about trying to patch
into the Air Traffic Control System?

39:27.932 --> 39:31.175
Yeah sure, I can get the
LA pattern on my scope.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.374
But we're talk’n about hundreds
of radar blips. Here take a look.

39:35.473 --> 39:39.148
See? There's Caitlin taking
that chopper back to Angelo.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.419
What are all the rest of those things?

39:41.646 --> 39:44.422
Graydon's chopper had rocket pods on it,

39:44.649 --> 39:46.322
like he'd been to the test range.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.358
String, you're brilliant.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.598
Punch in Barron's test
range. See what comes up.

39:56.928 --> 39:57.998
Got him.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.099
1 departure in the last hour.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.440
No wait.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.382
2 in 25 minutes.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.748
3 to 1 odds, Dom.

40:16.481 --> 40:20.759
How could you do this to me?
You think you have the right

40:20.818 --> 40:23.196
to interfere in other peoples' lives,

40:23.254 --> 40:25.131
to judge what's good for them.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.593
You're despicable!

40:28.826 --> 40:31.602
You have a perfect right to your anger.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.638
But hear me out.

40:36.334 --> 40:39.508
I berate employees when they
do not learn from mistakes,

40:40.004 --> 40:42.245
but I never did, my whole life.

40:43.007 --> 40:47.353
When your Mother and Father
died, I felt terribly betrayed.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.816
So I retreated into my office, into my work,

40:51.883 --> 40:53.123
just…

40:54.118 --> 40:56.655
when I should have been close to you.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.732
It was a terrible mistake.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.439
Then a couple weeks ago, I met a man.

41:04.662 --> 41:07.905
Santini made me feel the
loss of all those years.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.536
I felt the pain, but I hadn't learned anything.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.015
I retreated again.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.982
I made the ultimate retreat.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.489
I gave you one last big Christmas present

41:27.218 --> 41:28.891
and played dead.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.905
You should have come to me.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.912
That's what I said to myself 5 days ago

41:45.470 --> 41:49.577
in a mountain cabin, on the
North Island of New Zealand,

41:51.042 --> 41:55.855
the place I had chosen to live out my life.

41:57.482 --> 42:01.089
I woke up saying your name.

42:17.201 --> 42:21.877
Assault formation. Choppers Baker
and Charlie, we're going in.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.464
Margo.

42:42.460 --> 42:47.102
I see movement inside.
It's got to be them. Fire.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.583
Baker, Charlie, on the ground at 1 o'clock.

43:05.116 --> 43:07.460
There they are. On the ground.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.396
Baker, Charlie, we got company.

44:00.404 --> 44:02.213
Graydon, give it up.

44:02.440 --> 44:03.919
There's no chance you're gonna win.

44:04.175 --> 44:07.748
I want you and that chopper outta
here, or I'm gonna waste ‘em.

44:08.079 --> 44:10.320
Now, get over that horizon. Move.

44:19.457 --> 44:20.663
Now?

44:20.892 --> 44:23.429
No, not now. Don't rush me.

44:23.728 --> 44:26.231
After 20 years, I wanna savor this moment.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.832
What the hell are you doing?

44:27.932 --> 44:29.434
Are we over the horizon?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.411
- Yes, but ah…
- Turbos.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.586
What are you waiting for, Graydon?

44:40.378 --> 44:41.618
Fire!

45:40.504 --> 45:41.847
We thought you were dead, sir.
What's going on here?

45:42.306 --> 45:45.378
Where have you been hiding? Can you
tell us where you've been hiding?

45:49.780 --> 45:52.761
Please, please, ladies and
gentlemen. Please, just a moment.

45:52.817 --> 45:55.297
Please, I'm prepared to make a statement.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.797
Now I disappeared because I thought

45:57.855 --> 46:00.597
I wanted to be totally alone
for the rest of my life.

46:00.925 --> 46:04.668
But someone very important
to me changed my mind.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.504
Will you be staying with
the company, Mr. Barron?

46:06.564 --> 46:08.771
Well, that will be decided at a later date.

46:08.833 --> 46:11.973
But my Will, of course, has been invalidated.

46:12.036 --> 46:13.379
Will you be running the company, sir?

46:13.437 --> 46:15.007
Or will it be someone else?

46:15.139 --> 46:18.018
No, my granddaughter Margo, will be in charge

46:18.075 --> 46:20.351
of the day-to-day operations of the company.

46:20.411 --> 46:23.051
What's all this we've been hearing
about a super helicopter, sir?

46:23.114 --> 46:26.254
Yes well, there was no super helicopter.

46:26.550 --> 46:29.929
As a matter of fact, when my
plane crashed, I was delirious.

46:29.987 --> 46:32.024
It was just an ordinary chopper,

46:32.089 --> 46:36.231
flown by an extraordinary man, Dominic Santini.

46:39.096 --> 46:40.598
Dominic.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.807
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No more questions, please.

47:00.851 --> 47:03.457
You know Dominic, I was just wondering…

47:03.521 --> 47:04.864
Well maybe I shouldn't ask.

47:04.922 --> 47:06.162
No, go ahead, go ahead.

47:06.223 --> 47:09.534
Well, the 2nd time you saved
my life, you lost $40 million.

47:09.593 --> 47:11.231
Right, so?

47:11.562 --> 47:14.634
Well, did it ever occur to you to, at any time,

47:14.699 --> 47:16.201
to look the other way?

47:17.735 --> 47:19.009
No.

47:19.470 --> 47:22.007
Well, keep looking in your mailbox.

47:22.073 --> 47:23.746
I won't live forever.
