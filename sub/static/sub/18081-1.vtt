33:22.134 --> 33:23.967
               Aw, they're good.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.435

33:25.571 --> 33:26.436
         <i> I can imagine.</i>

33:26.538 --> 33:27.771
           Guess what?

33:27.940 --> 33:28.772
        [Celeste]: <i>  Que?</i>

33:28.841 --> 33:29.806
         I got the lead.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.808
       <i> That's fantastic!</i>

33:31.910 --> 33:35.112
 Aw, look at you, out in Vegas,
     working your butt off.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.647
        That's something
     I'll never get rid of.

          <i> Little sis,</i>
   <i> I'm sure you look amazing.</i>

    So, any guy in your life?

33:43.956 --> 33:45.255
     Just dancing my dream.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.192
         Maybe some day,
        you'll come home,

33:49.328 --> 33:51.461
        meet a great guy,
         start a family.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.030
      <i> I wasn't happy, Sis.</i>

33:53.198 --> 33:54.831
      I was spinning around
  like a hamster going nowhere.

33:54.967 --> 33:56.733
     Well, a hamster making
         lots of money.

33:56.835 --> 33:57.934
             Well...

33:58.070 --> 33:59.369
             I guess
   I'm happier when I'm poor.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.604
       <i> You sound lonely.</i>

34:00.739 --> 34:02.105
     I wish I could be there
      when your show opens,

34:02.241 --> 34:03.907
      <i> but with the family,</i>
         <i> I just can't.</i>

34:04.043 --> 34:05.709
             I know,
 but I'm going to get you here.

34:05.844 --> 34:06.910
         There's no way
   you're not coming to Vegas.

           [chuckles]

34:08.013 --> 34:08.911
      I've got to go, okay?

34:09.047 --> 34:09.880
    Send my love to the kids.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.715
           I love you.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.286
 [Blu and Debbie arguing loudly]

34:17.456 --> 34:20.322
    [Roxie]: I can't believe
 they're back to fighting again.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.426
       They just made up.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.165
This one looks
 like a doozy.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.400
       She is obsessively
         fixated on him.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.869
Co-dependent
is my word of the day.

34:35.974 --> 34:36.973
        He's such an ass.

34:37.109 --> 34:37.940
Well, I...

34:38.077 --> 34:39.775
          Don't say it.

34:39.945 --> 34:41.178
       Honey, let him go.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.481
           It sucks...

34:44.616 --> 34:45.748
       because sometimes,
          he's amazing,

34:45.884 --> 34:46.850
   and then, at the same time,
       he can be, like...

34:47.018 --> 34:47.784
A total dick.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.619
     That's a little harsh.

34:52.858 --> 34:53.723
     No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.225
You're not texting him.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.194
[Jon]: Guys only want
what they can't have, okay?

34:57.329 --> 34:59.062
Just let him stew
for a bit.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.064
     [Roxie]: Yeah. I mean,

35:01.166 --> 35:03.467
       how many times can
 the two of you keep doing this?

35:05.471 --> 35:08.271

35:08.407 --> 35:10.874

             -Yeah.

have you seen Blu?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.415
            No?

35:18.550 --> 35:20.917
Hey, have you seen Blu?
He said he'd be here.

35:23.388 --> 35:25.522
Girl, do you know Blu?
Yeah, my boyfriend?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.190
            Hey, Deb,

35:27.359 --> 35:28.325
you seemed a bit off.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.427
                   You just said
                   it was solid?

35:30.596 --> 35:31.394
                           What?

35:31.563 --> 35:32.496
               Oh, God, tell me.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.332
       I just don't think

35:35.467 --> 35:37.334
       your effort was up
to your usual amazing standards.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.969
    If you're really serious
      about being the best,

35:39.104 --> 35:41.438
  you need to be 100% present.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.106
 Are you threatening to cut me?

35:43.242 --> 35:44.341
I will if I have to.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.310
      Maybe you're spending
     a little too much time

35:47.479 --> 35:48.345
      with your boyfriend.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.379
Are you kidding me?

35:49.515 --> 35:51.148
             What the hell
             did you say to him?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.315
           Calm down.

            [Roxie]:
   No, Kevin's right, Debbie.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.651
 You and Blu fight all the time.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.153
          You break up,
    you get back together...

35:57.556 --> 36:00.423
        To interfere in my life,
        like everyone else.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.959
Debbie, stop letting him control
you like this.

36:03.095 --> 36:04.661

     telling me what to do.

          Look, all we're trying
          to tell you

36:11.136 --> 36:12.135
       is that we love you,
       and we're worried, and...

36:12.204 --> 36:13.069
             Don't.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.572

you show me you love me?

Oh, my God,

    have to ruin everything?

      to make things right,

     that I keep coming back

they come to this city,
and then, in no time...

57:17.568 --> 57:18.333
          What the hell
    is that supposed to mean?

57:18.469 --> 57:19.435
      That she deserved it?

57:19.603 --> 57:20.235
         That she asked
   for what's happened to her

57:20.337 --> 57:21.170
     because of who she is?

57:21.305 --> 57:23.138
        I didn't mean it
       to sound that way.

57:23.274 --> 57:24.206

               to help find her?

57:26.310 --> 57:27.376
         You're the cops,
         and you're not looking.

57:27.445 --> 57:28.310
This is Vegas.

57:28.412 --> 57:30.679
 People come here to disappear,

57:30.815 --> 57:33.649
  and people leave all the time
     and never tell a soul.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.684
Look, I'm sorry, but...

57:35.820 --> 57:37.586

   My sister has been missing
           for a week,

57:39.557 --> 57:42.024

        to do their job.

57:42.126 --> 57:43.292
          If you don't,
I'll tell the reporters outside.

57:44.695 --> 57:45.627
           I'm sorry.

57:45.696 --> 57:47.229
Word has gotten out
about Debbie.

57:47.364 --> 57:49.198
     If you don't make this
           a priority,

57:49.333 --> 57:50.365
I will tell them
that you're doing nothing,

57:50.501 --> 57:51.700
 that you don't care.

57:51.869 --> 57:53.802
         Just watch me.

57:53.971 --> 57:55.804
           [Celeste]:
    Somebody knows something.

57:55.906 --> 57:57.973
         You don't even
     have to say your name.

57:58.108 --> 57:59.775
      Just call the police.

58:00.911 --> 58:02.678
                     We all want
                    to find her,

58:02.780 --> 58:04.379
              and I'm going
              to bring her back.

58:07.117 --> 58:08.617
      We love you, Debbie.

58:08.752 --> 58:10.419
        Please come home.

58:37.281 --> 58:39.014
             Debbie?

58:45.422 --> 58:47.189
          [phone rings]

58:48.792 --> 58:50.092
              Yes?

58:50.194 --> 58:51.994
     <i> It's Detective Nelson.</i>

58:52.129 --> 58:53.662
     <i> We found Debbie's car.</i>

58:58.802 --> 59:00.569
        Is there anything
     that we could use here?

59:11.315 --> 59:12.281
                      Let me go!

59:13.350 --> 59:15.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I can't let you in.

59:15.185 --> 59:16.318
         Please, please!
         It's my sister!

59:16.487 --> 59:17.386
There's nothing here...

59:17.488 --> 59:18.720
  just a makeup bag in the car.

59:18.856 --> 59:20.122
       Then where is she?

59:20.257 --> 59:21.523
Right now, we're treating this
as a missing person's case.

59:21.692 --> 59:22.457
     It's always been that.

59:22.626 --> 59:24.359
 I know that you felt that way,

59:24.461 --> 59:25.928
          but we needed
    something more concrete.

59:26.030 --> 59:27.362
           Her missing
      was concrete enough.

59:27.498 --> 59:28.163
      You should have been
         looking sooner.

59:28.332 --> 59:30.032
         I promise you,

59:30.167 --> 59:31.967
       we'll let you know
      anything we find out.

59:42.279 --> 59:43.478
            Yes, great.
            Great, great, great.

59:43.581 --> 59:44.613
                  Nice movement.

59:44.782 --> 59:46.448
                    Just work on
                    relaxing.

59:46.584 --> 59:48.150
         Look like you're trying
         to enjoy yourself,

59:48.285 --> 59:50.118
                      and, uh...
                      big smile.

59:50.287 --> 59:51.553
                   Okay, let's
                   try it again.

59:51.722 --> 59:53.288
        Excuse me, Kevin?

59:53.457 --> 59:54.156
                           Yeah.

59:54.325 --> 59:55.958
        Detective Nelson,
           Vegas P.D.

59:56.060 --> 59:57.726
           Do you have
      a couple of minutes?

59:57.828 --> 59:59.127
                           Sure.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:02.431
               Hi.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:04.433
       I'd like to ask you
         a few questions

01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:06.101
     about the disappearance
    of Debbie Flores Narvaez.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.536
                  [Kevin]: Okay.

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:09.771
When was the last
time you saw her?

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.707
                     A week ago.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:13.108
          It was around the time

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.943
     she was supposed to start
     in the lead of Rendez-Vous,

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.345
            which was odd of her
             to miss that night,

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:17.579
                   of any night.

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:19.247
     Any hints before that,
    that something was wrong?

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.355
          No. She was on a high.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:27.956
            She'd just broken up
             with her boyfriend,

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:28.991
                        finally.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.659
            She was in
            a really good space.

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:31.827
Jason Griffith, right?

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:32.894
                           Yeah.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.496
          And what was
    their relationship like?

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.398
       Intense. They were
       obsessed with each other.

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:39.101
   You know, they would always
        fight, break up,

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.203
     get together, break up.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:44.940
              He was controlling
               and manipulating,

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:47.109
               and I don't think
               she saw that,

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:48.176
            and that's
            what sidetracked her

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.544
               from her dancing.

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:51.380
 So she ended it?

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:52.481
                     Yeah...

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.716
              well, so she said,
               but I don't know.

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.551
     It's like she couldn't
         accept the fact

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:59.287
     that he didn't love her
    as much as she loved him,

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.756
         and it drove her crazy.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.826
   I think more than anything,
  she just wanted to be loved.

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:08.864
                   Don't we all?

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:18.473
  I want all of Debbie Flores'
      credit cards tracked,

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:20.075
   phone records, everything,

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.443
      and I think it's time
         I paid a visit

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:22.611
       to Jason Griffith.

01:01:28.619 --> 01:01:30.952
  I want to do everything I can
        to help find her.

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:32.888
I appreciate that.

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:35.757
I tried calling you
last night.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.592
       Yeah, we were out.
      We went out dancing.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.194
                    Right, baby?

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:40.962
              Yeah.
    It was like a date night.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.833
     You said you saw Debbie
    the day she disappeared.

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:45.834
         Any word since?

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.070
  No, no, and it was that day.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.438
                  I was at home.

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:51.039
                    She came by,
                    you know,

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.742
            talked about nothing
            in particular.

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:55.677
           I hadn't seen her
           for ages before that.

01:01:57.281 --> 01:01:59.114
 We just lost touch, that's all.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.882
   According to her roommate,

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:02.684
 you and she dated
earlier this year.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:03.785
              Yeah.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.789
             Yeah, it was good.
             We got along great.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.125
                I didn't do
                anything to her.

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:13.128
            I swear.
       Like, why would I?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.196
          I loved her.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.201
                I wanted to help
                her career.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:20.769
         I gave her a chance
         to even be in my video.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.939
This is so horrible.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:25.407
       I hope she's okay,

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:27.075
          and nothing's
        happened to her.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:31.313
         Why did it end
     between you and Debbie?

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.682
    Debbie wanted more of me,

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:37.052
      but my first priority
          is my career.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:39.154
      She wasn't as focused
       as I needed to be,

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:43.625
        and she was just
        so hot and cold.

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:46.328
      Like, you never knew
    where you stood with her,

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:48.563
           and she would text me
           constantly.

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.031
    Like, hundreds of times.

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.933
       It was so intense.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:53.602
I had to call 911 a dozen times.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:56.471
              Like, I'm serious.

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.777
     She scared me at times.

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:05.614
  [Roxie]: <i>  We haven't covered</i>
        <i> Winchester yet.</i>

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:09.451
    Kevin was in Springfield
           yesterday.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:16.291
   Why don't we do Winchester
            together?

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:18.026
             -Okay?
             -Okay.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:19.394
          [phone rings]

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.532
     My heart skips a beat
     every time the phone rings.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.803
                          Hello.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.905
     <i> It's Detective Nelson.</i>

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.972
            <i> I wanted</i>
    <i> to let you know that...</i>

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:34.276
          <i> I wanted you</i>
     <i> to hear this from me.</i>

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:35.443
        What's going on?

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:37.212
            [Nelson]:
 <i> The Overton police department</i>

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.247
         <i> contacted us.</i>

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.449
<i>They found a young woman's body</i>
        <i> near Lake Mead.</i>

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:43.084
     Oh, my God, Debbie, no!

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:45.187
            [Nelson]:
   <i> It's on the Arizona side</i> .

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:46.621
     <i> I'm heading there now.</i>

01:03:46.723 --> 01:03:49.491
      <i> There's no positive</i>
 <i> identification at this point.</i>

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:51.927
So you don't know
that it was for sure Debbie?

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:53.328
         [Nelson]: <i>  No.</i>

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.598
        <i> The woman's body</i>
       <i> was badly burned.</i>

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.834
   <i> It's going to be difficult</i>
          <i> to identify.</i>

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:02.437
      <i> We should know more</i>
        <i> by the morning.</i>

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:16.985
        It's not Debbie.

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:20.856
        Coroner I.D.'d the body.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.824
             My God.
      We were up all night!

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:24.292
                      I'm sorry.

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:26.595
   It's always difficult to know
   what information to share,

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.263
            but I wanted to keep
            you in the loop.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:31.566
        That poor family.

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:34.035
       It's unimaginable.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:39.140
                 As part of what
                we're doing now,

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.308
        we've interviewed people

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.077
       who saw Debbie
       the day she went missing.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.246
 I've spoken with Blu Griffith.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.147
        He's cooperating,

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.984
   and he says that he saw her
      briefly on the 12th,

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:51.052
         that she was in her car
         and she drove off,

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:53.455
         so maybe she left town.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.258
                         No! No.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.659
                   Debbie would
                   have told us.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.263
We have record
 of a 911 call

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.631
made from
Blu Griffith's house

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:03.798
back in October.

01:05:03.934 --> 01:05:06.902
      He had assaulted her,
      and he was arrested.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:10.005
     He had his first appearance
     in court on that charge

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:11.006
               a week
               before Christmas,

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:12.641
                  but the charge
                  was dropped

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.943
                  because Debbie
                  was a no show.

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:16.011
       Maybe that's why...

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:18.546
       No, we cannot jump
         to conclusions.

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:22.884
     Debbie and Blu are two
     very, very volatile people.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.221
            I've got allegations
            that she stalked him

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:27.522
                 and called 911,

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:28.590
         and then he called 911,

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:29.991
   and in the middle of this,

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.593
         they can't keep
 their hands off of each other.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.297
     What about her lawsuit?

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:36.965
                It's a dead end.

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:37.966
             He's not a suspect.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.067
                   We spoke to
                   his attorney.

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:41.236
           He says the guy
           left town months ago.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:44.739
I wish
I'd come here sooner.

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:45.907
I could have looked
right away.

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:47.876
            I just...

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:50.912
         [thunder rolls]

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:57.452
          [phone rings]

01:06:00.891 --> 01:06:01.823
        Hey, you got Blu.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:02.824
         [Celeste]: <i>  Hi.</i>

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:05.427
        <i> This is Celeste,</i>
        <i> Debbie's sister.</i>

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:07.729
              Hey.

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:08.730
           [Celeste]:
 <i> I wanted to ask you something.</i>

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.465
     The police told me that
           you saw her

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.667
       in early December,
    the day she went missing.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:14.803
     Is there anything else
  you remember about that day?

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.504
         Nothing, uh...

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:18.707
   I just saw her in her car.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.176
  Didn't she get out of her car
        and talk to you?

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:24.546
          [Blu]: <i>  Um...</i>
   <i> nope, never said a thing.</i>

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:26.848
      <i> I'm really busted up</i>
         <i> she's missing.</i>

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.651
  She was constantly texting me
         or calling me,

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.686
   <i> but then it just stopped.</i>

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:32.787
         <i> Like, nothing.</i>

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:35.857
    <i> I want to help find her.</i>

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.626
      I loved your sister.

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:43.131
         I'm sorry, hey,
    I really gotta go, okay?

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:53.508
            [Nelson]:
        Why did you wait?

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:56.511
    I was afraid to call 911.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:59.381
I didn't know Debbie was missing
      until I saw it on TV.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:00.415
You said that you know
Jason Griffith.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:04.252
                   He was seeing
                  Debbie Flores.

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.487
             Yeah...

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.922
           and me too.

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.758
     I dated him last year.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.326
       I broke up with him
     as soon as I found out,

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:14.162
  And did you know he was also
   dating a dancer named Lisa?

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:17.399
         Not surprising.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.267
       It's what he does.

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:21.469
        He likes women...

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:23.138
         lots of women.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.106
You told Officer Davis
that you saw Blu

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.875
just after
Debbie disappeared,

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.143
around December the 14th,

01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:29.878
               about three weeks
               ago now.

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.715
      Tell me what happened
        when you saw Blu.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:37.485
     He and a friend of his
     just come by my house.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:38.520
           That's all.

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:40.955
              Okay.

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:43.691
       I think that maybe
  the information that you have

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.227
is making you feel
uncomfortable...

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:49.664
      ...and I also believe that
      you do want to tell us.

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.401
  You're doing the right thing.

01:07:58.809 --> 01:08:00.041
     They came by at night.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.745
          Blu asked me
       to store something.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.880
      He said he was moving
       and needed a place.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:13.655
           I told him
    I didn't have the room...

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:17.524
  and I asked him what it was.

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:21.261
            He said,
  "Do you really want to know?"

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:27.202
  I told him I wanted to know.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.675
  He said, "Debbie's in there."

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.444
          I didn't know
        if he was joking,

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.314
  but it really freaked me out.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.948
           I said no.

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:42.050
  I said, "You need to leave."

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.322
   [Nelson]: <i>  Where did Blu go</i>
     <i> when he left your house?</i>

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.393
          And you're sure it was
           a Vegas Truck Rental?

01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:55.263
                           Okay.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:58.633
           Thank you.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.272
    Roxie will be here later.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:05.740
    We have some other areas
            to cover.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.709
         I'm so worried.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.010
      I want my baby home.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.944
          I know, mom.

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:11.912
   Please don't give up hope.

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:14.716
    <i> Vamas a llevarla a casa.</i>

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.451
      She's my baby sister.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.756
          Give my kids
     a big hug for me, okay?

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:23.491
             I will.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:24.959
           [Celeste]:
    <i> Te quiero, Mami. Adios.</i>

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.000
  So we pulled rental contracts

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:33.600
            from all Vegas Truck
            Rental locations,

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:34.903
                  and got lucky.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.904
       Jason Griffith rented
       a truck on December 15th.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.238
Three days after
her disappearance.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.274
          Yup, and we got
          the truck's GPS record

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.176
      so we know the exact route
      from rental to return.

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:43.845
                  Now, the night
                  of the 15th,

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.546
the truck
stopped right here.

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:46.814
    Is that the woman's house

01:09:46.983 --> 01:09:48.049
   where they said they wanted
       to store something?

01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:50.585
 Yup. Blu stopped by her house,
          she said no,

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.519
      then they drove here,

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.487
                  didn't move
                  until morning.

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.421
              It's a truck stop.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:54.422
          Then the next morning,

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.057
      the truck is up here.

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:57.325
       That's Bonanza Way.
    It's up in the north end.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:09:59.561
        And what's this?
          Bonanza Way?

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.196
      Empty house for sale.
       That's all we know.

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:04.332
Get a warrant
for that house,

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.201
and then there's someone
we need to bring in.

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:10.772
            [Nelson]:
    We know you were with Blu

01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:11.940
      on December the 15th.

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:14.042
       We have a witness,
   puts you in a rental truck,

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:16.077
           and we know
     where that truck went.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:17.946
            I didn't do nothing.

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:19.914
            You know
    where Debbie Flores is...

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:21.216
     because you killed her.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:22.183
              I didn't kill her.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.318
                        I swear.

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:25.486
            [Nelson]:
  Then tell me what you did do.

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:29.991
        What are you going to do
        for me if I tell you?

01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:32.293
         I want a deal.

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.902
 You're facing a murder charge.
         What happened?

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:45.807
     Tell me what happened!

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.916
Hey, Deb!

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:55.917
    Haven't seen ya in a bit.

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:57.952
Yeah, hi.

01:10:58.088 --> 01:10:59.921
  What happened with that show
       you wanted to get?

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:00.888
                  Opens tonight.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:01.856
Wow. That's awesome.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:02.991
              Yeah.

01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:04.959
      Knew you could do it.

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:05.860
        Break a leg, huh?

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:07.528
                 Yeah!

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:09.897
             [Mike]:
<i>It was weird that she was there</i>

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:12.834
   <i> 'cause they had broken up.</i>

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:14.669
   <i> They were always fighting.</i>

01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:18.339
     <i> I felt bad for her...</i>

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:20.441
          <i> and then...</i>

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:22.377
       <i> then I heard them</i>
       <i> going at it again.</i>

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:24.445
     [Blu and Debbie argue]

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:27.382
         Keep your hands off me.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.152
      The hell is going on?

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:32.387
        Let her go, man!
           Let her go!

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.022
    You okay?

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:35.823
                   What the hell
                  are you doing?

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:36.824
                   It's fine.
                   It's nothing.

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:38.259
      This is not nothing.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:39.761
You want me to get you
some water or something?

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:40.728
                     We're good.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.664
                 Deb, I'm sorry.

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:43.631
               Come on, come on,
               come on.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.466
          Let's talk about this.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:47.435
             [Mike]:
  <u> <i> It was all good when I left.</i> </u>

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.771
     <i> They were watching TV.</i>

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:51.306
         [Debbie coughs]

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.373
   [Nelson]: <i>  So you went out?</i>

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:56.010
              Yeah.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:57.345
 I thought I'd come back later.

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.783
       I should've stayed.
     I shouldn't have left.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.085
        I come back, and
        he's alone on the couch.

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:06.688
   He was sitting in the dark,
             like...

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.926
    and she's on the floor...

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.461
         and he just looks at me

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:15.563
         and says,
         "You've got to help me.

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:18.299
            This is a change
            your diaper moment."

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:19.567
            [Nelson]:
      What does that mean?

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:21.436
             [Mike]:
    That I had to help him...

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:23.538
       but I was scared...

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.875
      'cause she was dead.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.945
Where is she?

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.749
 Tell me where Debbie's body is.

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:43.458
           [loud thud]

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:53.868
           Oh, my God.
        He wasn't lying.

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:58.005
          This is a crime scene.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:12:59.173
             I want the property
             sealed off.

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:01.809
          Get forensics
 and the coroner down here now.

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.393
         Mr. Griffith, I have
         some questions for you.

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:25.366
            I suggest
     you don't make a scene.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:26.467
            Not here.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:28.503
            Not now.

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:41.215
            We talked
     to your roommate, Mike.

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:44.519
  What do you think he told me?

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:49.490
                It's not what
                you think it is.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:53.928
Then tell me
what I should think.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:55.830
                           Um...

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:56.964
        I don't feel comfortable
        answering this

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.099
              without my lawyer,

01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.934
           just because I don't
           want to say something

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:01.636
               that you tie into
               something else,

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:05.740
       or you switch, or change,
       or whatever,

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:06.874
        but if there's something

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:08.276
         that I could personally
         help you with...

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.645
      Did you kill Debbie?

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.581
    No, I didn't kill Debbie.

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:14.882
  You see, something like that,

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.818
        I'd rather answer
     in front of my lawyer,

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:19.153
 just at least have him present

01:14:19.255 --> 01:14:20.188
                  to let me know

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:21.389
        if that's even something
        I should answer.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.824
   She did come by your house,
         though, right?

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.158
                       Yeah.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:28.896
So she wasn't
just in her car

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:30.465
the last you saw her?

01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:34.402
            She texted me
            like she always did.

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:37.238
           She said she was sad.

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:39.240
              I called her back,

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.975
   and then she just showed up
          at my house,

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:43.044
                 said she wanted
                 to go out.

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.278
           What then?

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:47.248
      [Debbie, screaming]:
   <i> What's the problem, then?</i>

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:48.816
            You know,
     let's talk it out, Blu.

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:50.551
            Come on!
       Talk to me, please!

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.020
             Just talk to me.
             I miss you so much.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:53.955
           I don't care.
           It wasn't always bad.

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:56.624
                So come on, Blu,
                please!

01:14:56.793 --> 01:14:58.226
               Just tell me...
               please tell me...

01:14:58.394 --> 01:14:59.427
           I thought
           we belonged together.

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:00.495
            I'm done!

01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:02.330
           I love you!

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:05.166
    -Keep your hands off me.
           -Come here!

01:15:05.301 --> 01:15:06.234
                 You need to go!

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:07.301
Listen to me!

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:09.504
   What the hell is going on?

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.038
                 Debbie, Debbie,
                 get off!

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.406
Debbie,
get off of him!

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:13.474
Get off of him!

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:14.442
[Blu]: <i>  So that's what happened.</i>

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:16.077
                      Calm down!

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:17.445
 [Blu]: <i>  My roommate came home.</i>

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:19.146
<i>He stopped her from hitting me.</i>

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:21.082
     He got her some water,
        and then he left.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.984
You didn't want
to be with her?

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.487
                   I didn't have
                   time for her,

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.589
                and she was just
                freaking out,

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.391
      like she did when she kept
       calling me and texting me

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:31.492
            like a crazy person.

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:32.727
                Like, you've got
                to believe me,

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:33.961
        she was like this
        the whole time we dated.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:35.730
    She was obsessed with me.

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:38.566
         She stalked me,
    and she did other stuff,

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:41.335
          like the time
    she slashed my car tires.

01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:42.904
     She was out of control,

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.038
            she did that
            with other guys too.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:45.873
  I'm not concerned about that.

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:48.242
I'm concerned about
the night she died.

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:49.911
   [Blu]: <i>  You didn't know her</i>
         <i> the way I did.</i>

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:54.849
    I want to see for myself
 if you're getting my messages.

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:00.354
        They're all here.

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:01.322
       You're ignoring me.

01:16:01.457 --> 01:16:03.190
             'Cause
   you're constantly texting!

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:04.158
                   Then respond!

01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:05.192
           Calm down.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.427
        -Don't touch me!
           -Calm down!

01:16:06.496 --> 01:16:07.361
                   Let go of me!

01:16:07.497 --> 01:16:09.297
                     I hate you!

01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:11.098
           I want you
     out of my life forever.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.037
                  Get off of me!

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:17.572
    [Blu]: Deb, listen to me!

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:19.974
               Stop touching me!

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:20.975
Calm down!

01:16:29.319 --> 01:16:30.284
                      Deb, stop!

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:37.224
   [Blu]: <i>  She stopped moving.</i>

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:41.963
      <i> She just lay there.</i>

01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:46.233
     God, I just wanted her
         just to get up.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.169
            I mean...

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:49.971
             [sighs]

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.908
        I kept-- I kept--
       I kept telling her,

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.944
     I was saying to her...

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.113
            "Get up!"

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320
 I loved her.

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:11.659
I thought she had a gun.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:12.760
                You saw the gun?

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:16.397
 I thought she had one.

01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:17.865
    But you never saw a gun,
     and she never had one.

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:21.636
       I really loved her.

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:23.371
       I just didn't want
         to be with her.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:25.339
I told her
it wasn't good for us

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:26.340
to be together.

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:27.708
         Because you had
      too many girlfriends

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.510
   for any one to be special.

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:33.714
          You loved her so much,
          you killed her.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.182
  It was-- it was self-defence.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:36.117
                 You're kidding.

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:38.552
  It was totally self-defence.

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:40.454
    She was going to kill me.

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:41.956
That's why she came
to my house.

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:43.290
   She was going to kill you?

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:44.625
That was
my assumption.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.761
I have a right to defend myself.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.462
      She was coming at me.

01:17:48.598 --> 01:17:49.397
                   You're bigger
                   than her,

01:17:49.532 --> 01:17:50.364
                   way stronger,

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.298
              and there's no way

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:52.600
                it could've been
                a fair fight.

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:54.201
   She couldn't have hurt you
     even if she wanted to,

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.805
 so how the hell do you see this
        as self-defence?

01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.907
       You strangled her,

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:01.308
      and then did nothing
       to try to save her.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:02.209
        You let her die.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:03.844
         I freaked out.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:12.620
          I knew no one
   was going to believe me...

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:16.190
Not you guys,
the cops...

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:17.958
nobody.

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:21.595
          I loved her.

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.899
I totally did.

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:27.735
              Um...

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.072
     but she-- she was just
     so obsessed, you know?

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.340
No one knew
what it was like with us.

01:18:33.443 --> 01:18:35.743
I'm telling you
the truth, man.

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:39.246
                     Look at me.

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:43.751
 I need you to look at me, Blu.

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:49.623
                 That's not what
                happened, is it?

01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:54.161
       Here's how I think
      it really went down.

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:55.463
                  Debbie was
                  at your house,

01:18:55.631 --> 01:18:56.831
                 and you argued.

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:58.232
       [Blu]: <i>  Okay, come.</i>
     <i> Let's talk about this.</i>

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:00.267
  We're not good. I'm in pain.
       You hurt my throat.

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:01.335
       I want to call 911.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:04.071
Don't call 911.
The cops will arrest me.

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:04.972
We're good.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.340
     You two have to chill.

01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:07.908
            [Nelson]:
   <i> You knew you'd go to jail</i>

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:08.776
       <i> if she called 911.</i>

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:09.910
   Is it safe for me to leave?

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:13.147
            [Nelson]:
   <i> Your career would be over.</i>

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.849
            -[coughs]
          -We're fine.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:19.086
            [Nelson]:
 <i> You were protecting yourself.</i>

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:22.022
    <i> You had to do something</i>

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:25.659
    <i> to keep her from getting</i>
 <i> in the way of your success...</i>

01:19:25.795 --> 01:19:27.294
         [Debbie coughs]

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:28.763
    <i> But she wouldn't listen,</i>
           <i> would she?</i>

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:31.799
        I'm in pain, Blu.

01:19:31.901 --> 01:19:33.167
                  I want to call
                   an ambulance.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.268
No, do not call 9--!

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:37.104
     I'll call one for you.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.039
                 Seriously, Blu!

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.841
     I'm performing tonight.
      I'm in frigging pain!

01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:42.309
                  I want to call
                   an ambulance.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.526
                   You cut
                   her legs off,

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:01.662
             and then buried her
             in concrete.

01:20:01.731 --> 01:20:03.731
            You twisted bastard.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.433
         I'm all done here.
         Turn off the recording.

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:15.509
              Hey.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:17.878
         We're going to transfer
         you to detention.

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:19.280
                  Probably be
                  a few minutes.

01:20:19.382 --> 01:20:20.614
            You want more coffee
            or something?

01:20:21.584 --> 01:20:22.883
                             No?

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.457
        So you panicked.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:33.561
Must be scary

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:35.963
to have someone you love die
in front of you like that.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.632
    Panic can make people act

01:20:38.768 --> 01:20:41.302
          in ways that
 they never thought they would.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:42.803
           I get it...

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:45.506
           and I think
   that's what happened, Blu.

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:48.409
I think
that panic took over,

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:49.276
and you regret
everything that happened,

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:52.146
then and after.

01:20:52.248 --> 01:20:53.814
 Right?

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.115
             But...

01:20:56.485 --> 01:20:57.852
 what did you do with her body?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.192
    I didn't know what to do.

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.896
         Mike helped me.

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:11.765
       He did that stuff.

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:13.100
          He was there
      right after she died.

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:16.470
      But what did you do?

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:21.909
     A couple of days later,
         we got a truck.

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:29.350
        I knew this house
     where people were away,

01:21:29.452 --> 01:21:30.417
           and, um...

01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:37.057
             well...

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:40.327
 we put her in a plastic barrel.

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:45.799
     No one would believe me
         if I told them.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.270
          I-- I had to!

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.073
    Then we had to switch her
        to other barrels,

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:55.676
        so she could fit.

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:57.144
We had to.

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:00.915
