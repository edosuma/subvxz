00:00.533 --> 00:02.800
<i>(â™ª "tool time" theme)</i>

00:04.904 --> 00:07.239
Welcome to green week
here on tool time.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.042
That's right. We'll be
demonstrating how you can
use recycled material

00:11.043 --> 00:14.212
To build a beautiful home
like this.

00:14.213 --> 00:18.282
The walls in this home
are made out of
recycled paper.

00:18.283 --> 00:20.886
The studs from
recycled old cars.

00:20.887 --> 00:24.723
Studs from old cars.
That clears up the mystery.

00:24.724 --> 00:27.392
I used to be
an old car.

00:32.731 --> 00:34.666
All right. Well,
we're gonna show you

00:34.667 --> 00:37.468
How you can use old tires
and aluminum cans

00:37.469 --> 00:39.037
To build walls.

00:39.038 --> 00:42.106
It's very simple, actually.
You stack your tires like so.

00:42.107 --> 00:43.675
To stabilize them,

00:43.676 --> 00:45.777
Put a little dirt
in there... Like that.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.816
Making sure
to put aluminum cans
in the holes

00:51.817 --> 00:53.919
Before you
put the dirt in.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.721
Use light-beer cans,
and your wall's less filling.

00:56.722 --> 01:00.559
You know, our friends
in the animal kingdom

01:00.560 --> 01:02.928
Have been using
recycled materials

01:02.929 --> 01:05.430
To build their homes
since the beginning of time.

01:05.431 --> 01:07.932
How many friends do you have
in the animal kingdom?

01:07.933 --> 01:11.436
"a hippo's coming over,
bringing that casserole
I like."

01:11.437 --> 01:14.839
"oh, look.
I'll play charades
with the cheetah."

01:14.840 --> 01:16.875
You know,
the african hornbill

01:16.876 --> 01:19.777
Builds his own nest
out of his own dung.

01:22.014 --> 01:24.516
That's an interesting
piece of news.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.184
You go to his house,
you can actually say this
without him getting mad,

01:27.185 --> 01:30.054
"boy, this house
smells just like..."
tim.

01:30.055 --> 01:32.791
We're gonna finish off
our wall with adobe,

01:32.792 --> 01:36.427
Which is a mixture
of sand, straw and mud.

01:36.428 --> 01:37.829
Just trowel her on.

01:37.830 --> 01:41.333
You can use a trowel,
or you can use your bare hands.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.912
Ah, there's nothing like
the feel of fresh adobe

01:53.913 --> 01:56.515
Underneath your fingernails.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.051
Pile it on, al.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.695
I might add that,
for you ladies at home,

02:10.696 --> 02:14.032
Adobe makes a wonderful
mudpack for the face.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.968
Why don't you show them
how to do that, al?

02:16.969 --> 02:18.503
I'd love to, tim.

03:22.868 --> 03:25.136
Brad, you don't need to
take apart the flathead.

03:25.137 --> 03:27.872
We're not putting this old motor
back in the new hot rod.

03:27.873 --> 03:30.342
Dad, this engine's
in better condition
than we thought.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.510
Doesn't matter. I wasn't
gonna use it, anyway.

03:32.511 --> 03:34.579
What kind of engine
are we going with?

03:34.580 --> 03:36.380
I haven't decided yet.

03:36.381 --> 03:38.483
You haven't decided
for five months.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.885
I'm gonna think about it.

03:40.886 --> 03:44.088
Putting a motor in a hot rod
is the most important decision
a man can make.

03:45.924 --> 03:47.993
I thought marriage
was the most important.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.194
Well, marriage,
engine in a hot rod -

03:50.195 --> 03:53.364
They'll be debating that
till the end of time.

03:53.365 --> 03:56.133
I still think
we oughta use
this flathead.

03:56.134 --> 03:58.336
Look, this is
a serious hot rod.

03:58.337 --> 04:00.405
It's gonna need some
serious power, buddy.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.140
Power isn't everything.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.909
Bite your tongue, brad.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.911
This whole car
will be retro.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.647
We can soup up this flathead
and get plenty of power.

04:09.648 --> 04:11.716
We can't get the same
horsepower as we can get

04:11.717 --> 04:14.885
Out of a big-block -
a 427, 454.

04:14.886 --> 04:18.488
We got time to go
to batten performance. We'll
check out what they're doing.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.659
Aw, I can't go now.
I promised mom
I'd get a haircut.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.894
Hey, great. Maybe this time,
you'll let the barber

04:23.895 --> 04:26.398
Actually touch the scissors
to your hair.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.801
What are you talking about?
Last time, he took off
almost a quarter of an inch.

04:29.802 --> 04:33.138
Quarter of an inch?
I got more hair in my nose
than that.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.908
Would you stop bugging me,
dad? It's my hair.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.110
Yeah, but your hair
lives in my house.

04:39.111 --> 04:41.946
Why do we go through this
every time?

04:41.947 --> 04:45.950
We wouldn't have to
if you'd get a decent haircut.
Get something more traditional.

04:45.951 --> 04:48.119
Like yours?
Yeah.

04:50.155 --> 04:52.290
What's the matter
with my hair?

04:52.291 --> 04:55.193
I hate to tell you,
but that look went out
with those machines

04:55.194 --> 04:58.430
That played those
round black things
on them that spun.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.232
Record player.
Ah.

05:01.233 --> 05:05.570
Record player? We were
just reading about that
in our history class.

05:10.075 --> 05:14.011
Hi. How'd the audition go?
Should I call you randy
or romeo?

05:14.012 --> 05:18.082
Well, until
they make up their mind,
you can call me "randy-o."

05:20.085 --> 05:21.719
What does that mean?

05:21.720 --> 05:25.523
They narrowed it down
to three guys, and the
final auditions are Tuesday.

05:25.524 --> 05:29.126
Cool. That is so great.
You're in the final three.

05:29.127 --> 05:30.762
Out of the original four.

05:34.499 --> 05:37.068
Well, I'm sure you're
gonna get it, anyway.

05:37.069 --> 05:41.773
I don't know. One of those kids
has been the lead
in all the school plays.

05:41.774 --> 05:45.610
But I'll bet that
he doesn't come from
a theatrical family.

05:45.611 --> 05:49.514
I hate to break this to you,
mom, but <i>tool time</i>
isn't exactly great theater.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.184
Even though it does
usually end in tragedy.

05:56.221 --> 05:59.858
I'm not talking
about your father.
I'm talking about me.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.259
I was the best
juliet ever

06:02.260 --> 06:04.362
At the hockaday
school for girls.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.264
I was also
their best othello.

06:08.501 --> 06:13.371
I'm sure you were
a very convincing black man.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.607
I'd be happy
to rehearse lines
with you.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.642
No offense,
but if I'm gonna
play a love scene,

06:18.643 --> 06:22.413
I'd rather not do it
with someone who was around
when the play was written.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.917
I only hope that you
look as good as I do

06:25.918 --> 06:29.154
When you're
350 years old.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.422
Hey, everybody.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.965
I think I just found
my juliet.

06:45.437 --> 06:47.739
Brad, your hair is so, um...

06:47.740 --> 06:50.841
Cool, isn't it? I was
gonna go with my usual
quarter of an inch,

06:50.842 --> 06:55.346
But at the last second,
I decided to go for something
just a bit different.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.415
And you got it.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.885
I was a little nervous
at first,

07:00.886 --> 07:02.954
But I think this look's
really working for me.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.723
Well, it's interesting.
It's short, it's long.

07:05.724 --> 07:08.226
It's got a tail.
It's interesting.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.831
You don't like it, do you?
No, I didn't say that.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.700
It just takes time
to get used to.
I'm getting used to it.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.569
I'm sure, eventually,
that I'll like it.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.541
I'm there. I like it.
All right.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.443
Who wouldn't like it?

07:26.444 --> 07:28.479
Hey, everybody.
Hey, dad.

07:32.717 --> 07:35.186
What the hell
happened to you?

07:35.187 --> 07:36.788
I got a haircut.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.657
With what, a weed whacker?
Tim.

07:41.026 --> 07:43.294
What is this thing?
It's a ponytail.

07:43.295 --> 07:45.329
Why did you do that
to yourself?

07:45.330 --> 07:48.166
I went to the barber,
I saw the picture,
and I thought it looked cool.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.502
You look like an idiot.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.171
Just give it some time.
You're gonna get used to it.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.173
I don't want to.
Yes, you do.

07:55.174 --> 07:58.309
No, I don't.
None of your other friends
have haircuts like this.

07:58.310 --> 08:00.811
You're always telling me
not to be like my friends.

08:00.812 --> 08:03.581
If all my friends
jumped in a lake,
would you want me to?

08:03.582 --> 08:07.218
With hair like this,
I'd ask you to join in.

08:08.487 --> 08:09.988
You're real funny.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.190
I'm not taking you
to the hot-rod shop
looking like that.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.892
Just because of my hair?
You got it.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.759
You promised
you'd take him.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.631
No. I don't want to go
anymore. I don't give a crap
about his hot rod or engine.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.299
Don't talk to me
like that.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.334
I won't talk to you.
I won't talk to you, either.

08:23.335 --> 08:24.702
Fine.
Double fine.

08:24.703 --> 08:26.704
<i>(both)</i> fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

08:30.842 --> 08:33.144
Well...

08:33.145 --> 08:35.847
That was mature.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.982
Don't blame him.
He's just a kid.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.955
I was talking about you.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.690
You like that haircut?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.891
No, but it's no big deal.
It's just hair.

08:47.892 --> 08:50.628
He looks like
pebbles flintstone.

08:52.164 --> 08:55.399
Tim, what brad is doing
is perfectly normal for his age.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.936
He's just expressing himself.
He's being an individual.

08:58.937 --> 09:01.772
So how do we
get him to stop?

09:01.773 --> 09:05.176
Why get so whipped up
about something
as unimportant as hair?

09:05.177 --> 09:07.045
It's more important
than you think.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.080
You let him get away with that,
next, he wants his earring.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.482
Earrings turn to tattoos,
tattoos to crime.

09:11.483 --> 09:14.552
Crime turns to jail
and another bad haircut.

09:16.521 --> 09:19.457
Well, I'm glad you're taking
the rational approach.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.559
We should let him get away
with whatever he wants?

09:21.560 --> 09:23.794
No. I am saying we should
pick our fights.

09:23.795 --> 09:25.997
Well, I'm picking this one.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.466
You're too lenient
because of the way
you were brought up.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.202
Lenient?
Hello. I was raised
in a military family.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.404
Hello. During peacetime.

09:34.939 --> 09:37.008
Tim, my parents
were so strict

09:37.009 --> 09:40.011
That none of us
ever had a chance
to express ourselves.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.814
As soon as I left the house,
I went wild.
Yeah.

09:42.815 --> 09:45.550
Your famous bra-less years.
Whoa.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.852
You know I did worse stuff
than that.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.888
It's not the same with boys.
We need to be strict with them.

09:50.889 --> 09:53.491
If my mother weren't tough,
I'd have gotten in
a lot of trouble.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.459
You did get in
a lot of trouble.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.528
Yes, but I had a neat
and attractive haircut.

10:02.468 --> 10:05.603
"farewell, farewell.
One kiss, and I'll descend."

10:05.604 --> 10:10.308
"art thou gone so, love, lord,
ay, husband, friend?

10:10.309 --> 10:13.010
"I must hear from thee
every day in the hour.

10:13.011 --> 10:16.747
For in a minute,
there are many days."

10:16.748 --> 10:18.783
Ohh.

10:21.587 --> 10:25.656
Mom, do you think your juliet
might be a bit over the top?

10:25.657 --> 10:28.593
Look, acting
is all about passion.

10:28.594 --> 10:32.062
You have to convey the passion
to the back row of the theater.

10:32.063 --> 10:34.965
With acting like that,
don't worry about
the back row.

10:34.966 --> 10:37.902
The whole theater'll
be empty.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.971
Ok, ok. One of my best qualities
as an actress

10:40.972 --> 10:43.507
Is I can take direction,

10:43.508 --> 10:46.511
So I'm gonna just
take this down a notch,
and let's do it again.

10:46.512 --> 10:49.280
Can I remind you I'm the one
trying out for the play?

10:49.281 --> 10:51.082
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
Come on, come on, come on.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.751
"I doubt it not, and all
these woes shall serve

10:53.752 --> 10:56.087
For sweet discourses
in our times to come."

10:56.088 --> 11:00.257
"o god, I have
an ill-divining soul.

11:00.258 --> 11:04.294
"methinks I see thee,
now thou art below,

11:04.295 --> 11:06.831
As one dead..."

11:06.832 --> 11:09.634
You know, me thinketh
she stinketh.

11:18.143 --> 11:20.344
Ice-cold pop
for my favorite son.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.613
I'm your favorite son?

11:22.614 --> 11:26.317
Well, you're my last hope.

11:26.318 --> 11:29.920
One son looks like
a sumo wrestler,

11:29.921 --> 11:32.556
The other one's in there
putting moves on his mother.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.627
Dad, I hope you never
get mad at me

11:36.628 --> 11:38.696
Like you did at brad.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.765
I won't have to get mad
at you like I got at brad.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.835
You'll never come home
with a haircut that looks like
the back of mr. Ed.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.741
You're measuring
for the new engine?

11:49.742 --> 11:51.475
Obviously you're not
listening to me.

11:51.476 --> 11:54.111
I thought you didn't care
about the hot rod.

11:54.112 --> 11:56.680
I don't. If you want to
mess it up by sticking in
the wrong engine,

11:56.681 --> 11:58.416
That's your business.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.585
You won't have my help anyway.
I don't need your help.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.853
Fine.
Well, fine.

12:02.854 --> 12:04.455
Double fine.
<i>(both)</i> fine, fine, fine.

12:08.293 --> 12:11.562
Did I mention that
you're my favorite son?

12:14.232 --> 12:16.500
"when he bestrides
the lazy puffying
of the clouds

12:16.501 --> 12:18.836
And floats upon
the bosom of the air."

12:18.837 --> 12:23.040
"o, romeo, romeo...

12:23.041 --> 12:25.343
"wherefore art thou,
romeo?

12:25.344 --> 12:28.679
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name."

12:28.680 --> 12:30.715
Oh, wilson,
I gotta tell you,

12:30.716 --> 12:33.084
You're a much better
juliet than mom.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.419
Well, thank you,
young randy.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.788
I wouldn't want to
disparage another actor,

12:37.789 --> 12:39.957
But at the greenville
school for boys,

12:39.958 --> 12:42.827
I was known as quite
a breathtaking juliet.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.928
And it wasn't easy
playing a love scene

12:44.929 --> 12:48.432
Opposite that
pimple-faced
herman dilbert.

12:48.433 --> 12:50.501
You know, I got
nothing from him.

12:50.502 --> 12:53.036
It was like acting
with a head of lettuce.

12:54.072 --> 12:56.908
Wilson, could we?

12:56.909 --> 12:59.509
As you wish.

12:59.510 --> 13:03.648
"or if thou wilt not
be but sworn my love,

13:03.649 --> 13:06.851
And I'll no longer
be a capulet."

13:06.852 --> 13:09.086
Well, I guess I'm the one
that's no longer a capulet.

13:09.087 --> 13:11.422
Apparently
I've been replaced.

13:12.891 --> 13:14.091
No, you haven't.

13:14.092 --> 13:16.193
I was just out here
rehearsing with wilson

13:16.194 --> 13:18.963
So I'd be good enough
to rehearse with you.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.236
Jill, I am so sorry.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.371
I had no idea
I was usurping your role.

13:27.372 --> 13:31.309
Oh, come on. You've had
your eye on this part
all week.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.976
Now, that is not true.

13:32.977 --> 13:36.080
Young randy came out here
and beseeched me
to step into the role.

13:36.081 --> 13:39.216
You beseeched him?

13:39.217 --> 13:42.586
I didn't beseech anybody.
I don't even know what
"beseech" means.

13:42.587 --> 13:44.688
There's no way
that wilson's juliet
is better than mine.

13:44.689 --> 13:46.757
You know,
the <i>hockaday herald</i>
said

13:46.758 --> 13:48.792
That my juliet
was so moving

13:48.793 --> 13:51.428
That they didn't even
need romeo.

13:51.429 --> 13:53.430
Ah, well,
my school newspaper

13:53.431 --> 13:55.599
Said that I was
"an astonishing juliet.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.703
A vision
of budding femininity."
oh, pfft.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.270
Girls?

14:02.541 --> 14:05.142
My audition's tomorrow.
Who's gonna help me?

14:05.143 --> 14:07.879
I will. I will. Romeo, romeo,
wherefore art thou, romeo?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.214
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

14:10.215 --> 14:13.017
Or if thou wilt not be
but sworn my love...

14:13.018 --> 14:15.552
And I'll no longer
be a capulet.

14:15.553 --> 14:17.655
"what's in a name?"

14:17.656 --> 14:20.524
<i>(both)</i> "that which we call
a rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

14:20.525 --> 14:23.794
So, rom -
so, romeo.

14:23.795 --> 14:25.696
Yo, romeo.

14:25.697 --> 14:27.731
Welcome back to green week
here on <i>tool time.</i>

14:27.732 --> 14:30.635
We'll show you how
to make your car more
environmentally friendly.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.636
First, let's talk about
how we can reduce

14:32.637 --> 14:35.172
Those foul fumes
that pollute the air.

14:35.173 --> 14:38.842
You might help out
by knocking off those
breakfast burritos.

14:42.780 --> 14:44.781
Getting back to engines,

14:44.782 --> 14:47.584
Let's talk about the octane
in your gasoline.

14:47.585 --> 14:51.055
If you're using premium,
you may be using more octane
than you need.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.457
You're not getting more power,
just polluting the air more.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.892
That's right.
In most cases,
87 octane

14:55.893 --> 14:59.063
Is all you need
for proper combustion.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.232
Speaking of combustion...
Hold on a second.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.401
Any of you guys blow up
at one of your sons

15:04.402 --> 15:06.670
'cause he came home
with a bad haircut?

15:06.671 --> 15:09.206
Oh, yeah.
Yeah? You?

15:09.207 --> 15:10.541
Yeah.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.510
You feel like
talking about it?
Sure.

15:12.511 --> 15:15.445
Come on, give him
a <i>tool time</i> welcome.
Get the guy down here.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.988
We're supposed
to be talking about
the environment.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.257
This is called
hair pollution.

15:27.258 --> 15:29.860
Tim. Tim. Tim.
Tim!

15:31.129 --> 15:33.664
My kid destroyed
the environment
at my house

15:33.665 --> 15:37.434
By coming home with
a psycho barbie haircut.

15:37.435 --> 15:39.770
Who do we have here?
Kendall.

15:39.771 --> 15:43.374
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
Give him a round of applause
and sit over here, kendall.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.315
When you get back to engines,
give me a call.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.187
So, kendall,
tell us about your boy.

15:57.188 --> 15:59.156
Well, cloyd's 19.

15:59.157 --> 16:00.690
Cloyd?

16:00.691 --> 16:04.027
Well, I wanted "clem,"
the wife wanted "lloyd,"
and we compromised.

16:04.028 --> 16:06.930
You're kidding, right?
No.

16:08.032 --> 16:11.135
All right. So tell us
more about the haircut.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.305
When he was 15, cloyd came home
with one of those punk haircuts,

16:14.306 --> 16:17.241
The kind with those spikes
sticking out all over.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.543
What you do is just
grab him by the heels

16:19.544 --> 16:22.412
And use him
to aerate your lawn.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.116
You're kidding, right?
Yeah.

16:26.851 --> 16:28.785
<i>(mouths)</i>

16:28.786 --> 16:31.389
So when he came home
with the bad haircut, you -

16:31.390 --> 16:33.024
I can tell by you,
you laid down the law.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.861
I grounded him till he agreed
to get hisself a normal haircut.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.296
Boy, was he mad at me.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.065
Get past it. A kid's
gonna be mad at you.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.167
Don't worry, 'cause you
just want the best for him.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.869
You want him to be someone
you can be proud of. Right?

16:45.870 --> 16:48.272
That's right, tim.
So he's 19 now.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.440
Years have passed.
How's cloyd doing now?

16:50.441 --> 16:52.476
Well, it's kinda
hard to say.

16:52.477 --> 16:55.178
I haven't heard from him
since he shaved his head
and joined that cult.

16:55.179 --> 16:56.980
Huh?

16:56.981 --> 17:00.283
The wife says they gave him
one of those silly names.
Now he's baba ram cloyd.

17:02.153 --> 17:03.187
You're kidding.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.588
What do you think?

17:04.589 --> 17:08.291
It's getting pretty darn
hard to tell right now.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.994
Well, unfortunately,
I'm not kidding, tim.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.897
Well... We'll be right back
with <i>tool time</i>

17:13.898 --> 17:16.834
After these messages
from binford tools.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.741
Hi, honey.
How's it going?

17:24.742 --> 17:26.042
I got a problem.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.844
What's the matter?

17:27.845 --> 17:30.748
Wilson's a more convincing
13-year-old girl than I am.

17:33.618 --> 17:38.155
And you think
you have the problem?
Is brad home?

17:38.156 --> 17:40.858
He's up in his room.
You're not gonna
yell at him again.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.127
No. Calm,
rational discussion.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.995
What are you gonna say?

17:44.996 --> 17:48.699
First, I need him
to help build the hot rod.
It's our project.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.734
Second, I don't want him
running off with a cult

17:50.735 --> 17:54.170
And calling himself
baba-raba-lama-ding-dong brad.

18:01.879 --> 18:03.447
<i>(knock on door)</i>

18:04.882 --> 18:06.149
Come in.

18:07.985 --> 18:11.655
Man. Hey, brad,
are you in here someplace?

18:12.857 --> 18:14.992
Can we talk for a minute?

18:14.993 --> 18:16.893
If it's about my hair,
forget it.

18:16.894 --> 18:19.062
It is about your hair.
Now listen up.

18:19.063 --> 18:22.733
I've been thinking about it,
and I'm able to look past
your hair...

18:22.734 --> 18:24.802
Right into your bald scalp.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.905
That's ok if that's
the look you're going for.

18:27.906 --> 18:29.539
What are you saying?

18:29.540 --> 18:32.209
I'm saying wear your hair
however you want it.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.177
So you're really ok
with it?

18:34.178 --> 18:36.514
I'm ok with it.

18:36.515 --> 18:39.016
Why'd you get
so crazy about it
in the first place?

18:39.017 --> 18:42.953
'cause I didn't like
what I saw when I first
walked in the house.

18:42.954 --> 18:45.456
Didn't you ever get a haircut
your parents didn't like?

18:45.457 --> 18:46.423
Ay!

18:51.363 --> 18:54.898
I wanted to,
but they wouldn't let me.

18:54.899 --> 18:58.769
At your age,
I would've killed
to look like ringo.

18:58.770 --> 18:59.770
Who?

19:02.407 --> 19:04.675
Ringo.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.810
Fab four.
"yeah, yeah, yeah."

19:08.246 --> 19:10.047
Let's move on.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.283
So you're treating me

19:12.284 --> 19:14.351
The way your parents
treated you, then.

19:14.352 --> 19:17.254
It just happens.
Eventually, you turn into
your parents.

19:17.255 --> 19:19.389
And one day, you're
gonna turn into me.

19:19.390 --> 19:23.661
Oh, boy. I'm gonna need
a lot of medical insurance.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.829
I need some help
measuring the chassis
for the new motor.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.464
Can you help me?

19:27.465 --> 19:31.168
I guess. But I guess that means
you're going with the big-block?

19:31.169 --> 19:33.304
Yeah, I have to.
Everybody's doing it,
you know.

19:33.305 --> 19:36.106
So if everybody
jumped in a lake,
you would do it, too?

19:36.107 --> 19:38.875
<i>(grunting)</i>
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:38.876 --> 19:40.944
Where have I
heard this before?

19:40.945 --> 19:43.747
We can still
soup up the old flathead
and get the power you want.

19:43.748 --> 19:47.551
I mean, look at this guy.
He's got 350 horsepower
on that flathead.

19:47.552 --> 19:49.853
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

19:49.854 --> 19:52.656
The retro look might work
for the hot rod.

19:52.657 --> 19:54.591
See? It sounds pretty good.

19:54.592 --> 19:58.462
There's a place in dundee.
Motor city flatheads.
We'll go check them out.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.129
All right, let's go.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.198
When we get back, maybe you'll
wanna clean up your room?

20:02.199 --> 20:05.435
I just cleaned it.
Looks good.

20:05.436 --> 20:08.572
It's kind of chilly outside.
I suggest you wear a hat, son.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.376
Sorry. I won't
wear the hat,

20:12.377 --> 20:14.944
But I would be willing
to stop by the barber shop.

20:14.945 --> 20:16.613
You would?

20:16.614 --> 20:19.215
Yeah. We can get you
that ringo cut
you've always wanted.

20:22.052 --> 20:25.021
There's one problem.
We'd have to find
a barber old enough

20:25.022 --> 20:27.524
To remember
who that guy is.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.634
I hope he gets the part.
Don't you think it would be
cool to see randy as romeo?

20:36.635 --> 20:37.967
You know,

20:37.968 --> 20:40.637
I don't think it's cool
to see randy as randy.

20:43.275 --> 20:47.011
Well? What happened?
Did you get the part?

20:47.012 --> 20:49.346
Well, I...

20:49.347 --> 20:52.716
You don't wanna tell me
because you're afraid I'll
want to rehearse with you.

20:52.717 --> 20:54.418
Will you?
Did you get the part?

20:54.419 --> 20:56.320
I asked you first.

20:57.421 --> 21:00.123
Ok. If you don't want
to rehearse with me,

21:00.124 --> 21:02.026
You don't have to.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.093
I got the part.

21:04.094 --> 21:08.264
Oh, please, please, please
let me rehearse with you.
I promise I'll be better.

21:12.103 --> 21:15.506
Why get whipped up
over something
as unimportant as hair?

21:15.507 --> 21:17.474
It's important than you think.

21:17.475 --> 21:19.476
Let him get away
with the haircut,
next he wants an earring.

21:19.477 --> 21:22.512
Earring turns to tattoos,
tattoos to crime.
Crime turns to...

21:22.513 --> 21:24.281
<i>(gibberish)</i>

21:28.853 --> 21:32.956
Welcome back to green week
here on <i>home improvement...</i>

21:32.957 --> 21:35.525
No, that would... No, no.

21:35.526 --> 21:38.294
That would be the name
of the show that we do.

21:38.295 --> 21:41.564
It's <i>tool time.</i>
<i>Tool time,</i>
