WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:05.630
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.472
What can I get you?

00:12.600 --> 00:14.477
What have you got?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.198
Anything you want.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.270
I'll bet you do.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.876
Why don't you tell me.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.235
Maybe you'd like to see a menu.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.632
No, I don't need one.
I know what I want.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.678
Are we talking about the same thing?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.312
I think so.

00:35.480 --> 00:41.237
Then maybe you'd like to whisper
what you want in my ear.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.913
Scotch and soda?

00:49.640 --> 00:52.598
He's toying with me.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.239
Chased out of the pocket,
he's gonna throw it on the run,

02:05.400 --> 02:06.674
it's incomplete.

02:06.840 --> 02:11.277
Good Lord, Sam, isn't this the tenth
football game you've watched today?

02:11.440 --> 02:15.069
It only seems that way.
That's the beauty of football.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.439
Sundays. The incessant drone
of the television,

02:20.600 --> 02:24.070
the stench of beer
and monosyllabic conversation.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.993
That's it. Get into it, girl.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.950
Oh, Diane. Listen, I dropped by
to give you a bit of news.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.759
I've decided to go away
for a while.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.672
I just wanna collect my thoughts

02:37.840 --> 02:40.798
and see if things look brighter
from a new perspective.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.235
Frasier, I think that's terrific news.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.392
A very positive step.
I'm so happy for you.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.154
Well, thank you. I'm happy for myself.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.110
Say, wait a second, Diane.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.511
Crazy notion just jumped into my head,
I don't know where it came from,

02:55.680 --> 02:58.114
but I was wondering if
you'd like to come along.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.631
I mean, after all,
we do travel well together,

03:01.800 --> 03:03.950
and we have that matching luggage.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.679
Frasier, I really don't think
that would be a good idea at all.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.597
Of course. I understand.

03:13.080 --> 03:18.791
Oh, Diane. I've been putting off telling
you something, but I feel I must now.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.838
You've been using the word
"really" far too frequently.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.868
In fact, it's become really noticeable.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.474
It's really quite maddening, really.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.318
Frasier, I know you're disappointed
that I didn't accept your invitation,

03:32.480 --> 03:37.031
but I really-- I don't think that's
any reason to get on my case.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.159
"Get on my case."
What a charming bit of slang.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.394
Frasier, nitpicking at my choice
of the correct modern English

03:47.560 --> 03:49.471
does not make you
any more attractive to me.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.877
If that's the purpose in your visits here,
perhaps you should find another tavern

03:53.040 --> 03:55.349
in which to bore the life
out of the clientele.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.398
I'm so sorry to disappoint you,
Miss God's-Gift-to-Men.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.199
It just so happens that I come here
to share the companionship

04:04.360 --> 04:07.875
of my male friends. So, men,
what's on the agenda tonight?

04:08.040 --> 04:11.430
- Football.
- Oh, good Lord.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.553
I mean, "Rah."

04:14.760 --> 04:18.673
Using a colloquialism to ingratiate
yourself with the rabble?

04:18.839 --> 04:22.515
How very sad.
How really very sad.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.154
Did you see that bootleg by Montana?
The guy's unstoppable.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.436
Woody, looks like you're
gonna win the bar pool today.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.875
The Rams still have a chance,
and if they make a comeback,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.350
- I take the pool.
- Woody, you know, if you win this,

04:36.520 --> 04:38.988
that's gonna make three weeks
straight you've been in the money.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.833
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on a streak.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.036
You know, I've always been
a lucky guy.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.633
Back home I won a haircut.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.198
The heck kind of contest was that?

04:51.360 --> 04:54.670
Well, it wasn't really a contest.
It was just policy.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.593
See, if the barber nicks your ear,
you get a free haircut.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.278
I think Schopenhauer put it aptly
when he said:

05:03.440 --> 05:07.035
"Noise is the most contemptuous
of all forms of interruption. It is--"

05:07.200 --> 05:09.316
Impertinent.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.999
Excuse me?

05:11.160 --> 05:13.549
What you were trying to say was:

05:13.720 --> 05:17.918
"Noise is the most impertinent
of all forms of interruption."

05:18.080 --> 05:20.230
She said "contemptuous,"
can you believe that?

05:20.400 --> 05:23.676
I thought I'd have a conniption.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.638
Stop this quibbling at once.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.439
As the only two entities
of any discernible intellect in this place,

05:30.600 --> 05:32.431
it is our duty to set an example
for the others.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.956
You're only saying that because
you know I'm smarter than you are.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.998
This from a man who mispronounced
"rémoulade" at a dinner party.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.037
Diane, I am fed up
with the rémoulade incident!

05:42.200 --> 05:44.111
- lsn't it true?
- You are totally overblowing it.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.111
Hey, hey! Would you two cut it out.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.953
You're drowning out a perfectly good
tire commercial.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.070
There's the gun. Final score: 24...

05:53.240 --> 05:56.869
Yeah, all right. There's the final.
Looks like you won, Woodrow.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.632
- Hey, Woody.
- Hey, Woodrow.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.074
Thank you very much.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.708
I want you to know I couldn't
have done it without all you guys

06:02.880 --> 06:05.269
because, well, this is your money.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.632
Here you go. Seventy-five big ones.
Paul, second place. Twenty-five.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.678
You did good, kid, but I still think
I got a more reliable system.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.558
Yeah? I could really use one.
What's yours?

06:14.720 --> 06:17.792
I just bet opposite whatever you pick.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.996
So, Woody, what's this system
you got up your sleeve there, huh?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.071
- Yeah, Woody.
- Well, I don't actually have one.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.800
I just kind of look at the picks
and one team jumps out at me.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.748
- He's got it down to a science.
- Really.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.188
Imagine how much
he'd have made

06:33.360 --> 06:34.793
if he'd parlayed some of those bets.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.837
- What's that mean?
- Well, that's when you bet

06:37.000 --> 06:39.514
a series of games with a bookie.
I mean, you gotta win them all,

06:39.680 --> 06:44.071
- so the odds are pretty long.
- Do you guys know a real bookie?

06:44.520 --> 06:46.954
I got a friend who's got a friend
who's got a friend.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.510
- And he's a bookie?
- No, but his friend is.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.677
Wow. You know, if I bet with a bookie,

06:54.840 --> 06:57.274
I'd have something to tell my
grandchildren.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.712
Sam, I don't think you should
encourage Woody

07:00.880 --> 07:02.791
to pursue illegal activities.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.714
Oh, lighten up, will you, Diane. It's
a part of a guy's passage into maturity.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.429
You know, like going to a cathouse
or whizzing off a balcony...

07:12.600 --> 07:15.592
...or mooning out of the back of a car.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.036
Or on a really good night, all three.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.590
- Yes, the triple.
- Triple.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.278
Hey, why don't we-- Yeah, good idea.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.113
I got the schedule for
next week's games here.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.069
Anything jumping out at you?

07:35.520 --> 07:38.830
Oh, yeah! These are the strongest
feelings I've had yet.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.911
- Well, what? What do you got?
- What's up?

07:41.080 --> 07:45.119
All right. Indianapolis, Tampa Bay,

07:45.280 --> 07:47.157
Buffalo just hit me right in the eye.
Houston.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.117
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Yeah, I'll bet it did.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.113
- What's so funny?
- All those teams you picked,

07:52.280 --> 07:54.157
they're a long shot, Woody.
He doesn't even know

07:54.320 --> 07:56.788
- what the point spreads are.
- What difference does that make?

07:56.960 --> 07:59.076
I haven't looked at
the point spreads all year.

07:59.240 --> 08:03.028
Hey, Sam, I'd like to bet these teams
with your bookie.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.749
Okay. All right. How much you
wanna put down? Twenty, 30 bucks?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.115
Thousand dollars.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.952
You own $1 000?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.951
Yes, ma'am, it's all my savings.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.918
Woody, I'm not gonna let you throw
away all your money on gambling.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.038
You know, Woody, all that money
on one shot, you gotta be nuts.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.839
Yeah, why don't you sit down
and give it a little thought here.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.277
Excuse me. I've been observing

08:25.440 --> 08:28.989
what's been going on over here
and I have something to say.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.639
Listen up here, Woody.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.792
Do you realize
that in the course of the evening,

08:33.960 --> 08:38.476
Diane has made 1 7 errors
in the areas of grammar...

08:40.840 --> 08:43.308
...etiquette and statement of fact?

08:45.240 --> 08:50.439
Frasier, your pedantry is insufferable.
And you suck eggs.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.870
All right, Sam, I've thought about it,
and I've decided

08:54.040 --> 08:57.237
- I definitely wanna make the bet.
- No, you don't. Think some more.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.039
Well, I'm the one who's been
winning the pool.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.553
And you know what I think?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.073
You think I'm some dumb hick

09:03.240 --> 09:05.435
who can't make it on his own
in the big city.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.512
No, I don't. I just think it's a dumb bet.
Case closed, Woody.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.069
But it's my money
and I'm willing to take the risk.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.669
Woody, I can dig up
a bookie somewhere.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.355
- I'll make the bet for you.
- Woody, I'll make the bet for you.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.636
Might as well keep it
in the family.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.189
- Sam...
- No, no. You heard him.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.113
It's his decision. It's his money.
He's a grown-up.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.796
- Where's your money?
- Thanks, Sam.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.274
Come on, man, don't tell me you keep
your money in your shoe.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.675
Boy, you guys really do think
I just fell off the turnip truck.

09:39.320 --> 09:43.677
This is where I keep the map of where
the money's buried in my backyard.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.195
- Hey, is that him?
- Yeah, yeah, I think it is.

09:56.360 --> 10:00.273
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

10:00.440 --> 10:02.078
For he...

10:04.120 --> 10:06.270
- Good to see you all too.
- Sorry, Sammy,

10:06.440 --> 10:08.351
- we thought you were Woody.
- Can you believe it?

10:08.520 --> 10:12.559
- The kid actually hit his parlay.
- I know. Boy, that's fantastic, isn't it?

10:12.720 --> 10:14.517
- Yeah.
- So, what is this?

10:14.680 --> 10:17.148
- What are you guys doing?
- We're planning a little celebration

10:17.320 --> 10:20.153
- in honour of Woody's good fortune.
- A celebration, huh?

10:20.320 --> 10:23.278
You mean like food, music, drink,
that kind of thing?

10:23.440 --> 10:25.317
We're not providing any of that,
but we're hoping

10:25.480 --> 10:27.835
Mr Moneybags will spring for that
when he gets here.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.633
I don't think it's such a good idea
to make a big deal out of this.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.268
You'd just be encouraging him
to gamble some more.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.274
He won 10,000 bucks. What more
encouragement does he need?

10:38.440 --> 10:40.829
- Oh, fine.
- Hey!

10:41.000 --> 10:43.878
Thanks a lot, guys.
Hey, but guess what.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.556
I've got some great news.
I won that parlay.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.029
We know, Woody. Congratulations.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.191
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.828
- So, Sam, did my money get here yet?
- No, not yet.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.798
They'll be bringing it pretty soon.
Matter of fact, I'll call right now.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.157
Carla, why don't you start
that celebration here.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.031
Hi, everybody.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.313
Diane, listen.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.836
I'm here to tell you that I've just spent
the most painful week of my entire life.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.789
I was ice-fishing in subzero-degree
temperatures in Nova Scotia.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.430
I don't think I could have stood it
for another minute, but it was worth it.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.957
Because every iota of pettiness in me
was left back on that frozen tundra.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.552
So I'm here just to ask you
to please forgive me.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.750
- Apology accepted.
- lncomplete sentence.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.317
Oh, my God.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.789
I hope they're still biting.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.231
What's this?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.992
"Please"...

11:49.160 --> 11:52.516
-...something.
- Please get in here!

11:54.640 --> 11:57.712
Sam, is this an M or a double N?

11:58.760 --> 12:03.515
Just forget about that and sit down,
will you. I'm in big, big trouble.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.033
I did something that--
It felt so right when I did it,

12:08.200 --> 12:12.079
but now it turns out to be all wrong.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.392
What's her name,
and how many months?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.110
I never placed Woody's bet.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.630
Oh, my God.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.790
Sam, for the first time in your life
you had the right intentions,

12:31.960 --> 12:34.872
and it still blew up in your face.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.189
It was such a stupid bet.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.920
I was just trying to protect him.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.913
What am I gonna do?
I mean, I don't have $10,000.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.556
Oh, dear.

12:47.640 --> 12:53.510
Well, we know that Woody
actually did pick the winning teams.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.713
Yeah? So?

12:55.880 --> 12:59.873
- So why don't you go to the bookie
- Bookie.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.792
and tell him that you
honestly intended

13:01.960 --> 13:04.349
to wager on the winning teams...

13:05.680 --> 13:08.240
...and see if he won't
give you the money.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.358
That's a good idea.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.080
While I'm at it, why don't I just tell him
that I meant to bet on

13:13.240 --> 13:16.676
- all the winning teams since 1975?
- Can you do that?

13:16.840 --> 13:18.478
Please!

13:19.320 --> 13:22.835
Well, Sam. Why don't I just
sound Woody out for you?

13:23.000 --> 13:27.630
There's always the possibility
that the money isn't important to him.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.553
Yeah. Maybe not.
Oh, that's a good idea.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.994
Oh, thank you.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.673
Sam, by the way,

13:33.840 --> 13:38.311
thank you for coming to me for advice.
I'm touched.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.199
Well, if this works out, you will be.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.592
Hey, Sam, that guy still didn't
show up with the money.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.035
- He is gonna give it to me, isn't he?
- Of course he will.

13:49.200 --> 13:54.069
No bookie would welsh on a bet.
He'd be the lowest spitwad on earth.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.549
Actually, murderers are lower.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.472
You know, back home we'd take
welshers, rub them with bacon fat

14:00.640 --> 14:03.438
and throw them in the sty
with Romeo, the friendly hog.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.030
- Well, gee whiz--
- Woody, why don't you and l

14:07.200 --> 14:08.519
- have a chat.
- Yeah.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.468
- Oh, sure, Miss Chambers.
- There's a table right over here.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.233
Woody...

14:21.400 --> 14:23.118
...I want to speak metaphysically.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.673
And you need money for
the language lessons. No problem.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.669
Let's start again.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.512
What I'm talking about
is the meaning of money.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.033
What is it worth?

14:37.200 --> 14:40.556
It can't buy love, it can't buy friends,
it can't buy happiness.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.029
Well, you're right, and I already have
all those things.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.713
So, in fact, you have everything.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.838
And it wouldn't matter if you
never got that money at all.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.395
Oh, you're serious.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.998
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Chambers.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.318
You see, it's just that my family
never had a lot of money

14:59.480 --> 15:02.870
and still my folks were always
making sacrifices for us kids,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.156
especially my mom.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.399
I remember something she
used to say to me, she'd say:

15:08.560 --> 15:12.314
"Woody, hold on to your dream.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.155
I lost mine, but I want yours
to come true."

15:17.600 --> 15:21.593
It always made me sad to think of
what Mom gave up for us.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.831
What was your mom's dream?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.598
To be a drummer in a power trio.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.955
Her big hero was Ginger Baker
in Cream.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.874
Whenever we'd walk by
the music store in town,

15:36.040 --> 15:39.749
she'd just stare and stare
at the Ludwigs in the window.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.749
I knew even though she was
standing in front of Keller's Music,

15:42.920 --> 15:44.876
that in her head she was up
on some stage

15:45.040 --> 15:48.077
banging out the solo in "Toad."

15:48.640 --> 15:52.428
It must have been tough to go back
to breading cutlets.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.557
Now she's gonna get those drums.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.838
And with heavy metal coming back,
who knows what might happen.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.432
Bless you, Woody.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.830
Bless you, Miss Chambers.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.319
How'd it go?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.596
Not well.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.593
Sam, I feel utterly defeated.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.992
Here you came to me
as a friend asking for my advice,

16:22.160 --> 16:25.596
- and I let you down.
- I know.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.793
Is there anything I can do
to help you in this time of crisis?

16:31.960 --> 16:34.030
Not dressed.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.798
What a shot!

16:42.960 --> 16:45.758
Sam, maybe you ought to
call the bookie again.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.876
Sit down for a minute here, will you.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.311
Woody, you know that old
expression, "When you win a bet,

16:55.480 --> 16:57.675
you never get paid for eight days"?

16:57.840 --> 17:01.753
- No, but I like it.
- Well, it's an old lrish expression.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.798
Which is probably why the bookie
hasn't shown up yet.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.997
But you know what, it gives you
an opportunity

17:08.160 --> 17:11.709
- to do some financial planning.
- Financial planning?

17:11.880 --> 17:14.109
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
like spreading out the payments

17:14.280 --> 17:16.953
over a period of time, just like they do
with the lottery winners.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.588
- Lottery winners?
- Yeah, yeah. All right. Listen.

17:19.760 --> 17:24.356
Here's my plan.
Now, I'll keep the $10,000 for you

17:24.520 --> 17:27.876
and I'll give you, let's say,
$1 a week for 10,000 weeks.

17:28.040 --> 17:33.558
Or, all right, maybe the deluxe plan.
Two bucks for 5000 weeks.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.233
What do you say?

17:35.400 --> 17:39.029
Well, it's a tough choice,
but I think out of those,

17:39.200 --> 17:40.952
I'll stick to the whole thing at once.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.439
- You're kidding me!
- No.

17:42.600 --> 17:47.151
No, you're missing the obvious benefit
of spreading out the tax burden.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.515
- Am I right, Norm?
- Oh, yeah. Great plan.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.468
You'll be real happy you did it when
you reach the age of 412, I think.

17:58.640 --> 18:02.110
Let's talk, Woody. Come on.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.076
Sit down, Woody.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.956
I've been trying to think of
an easy way of saying this,

18:13.120 --> 18:14.394
but I don't think there is any.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.476
I never placed your bet
with my bookie.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.312
Here's your thousand dollars back.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.272
You never placed the bet?

18:28.440 --> 18:32.035
No, I was trying to take care of you

18:32.200 --> 18:34.760
the way Coach used to
take care of me.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.832
And it worked out about as well, too,
which scares the hell out of me.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.991
Sam...

18:55.880 --> 18:58.030
...I wanna thank you.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.156
You're welcome.

19:00.320 --> 19:05.314
Oh, wait a second here.
Why aren't you going crazy?

19:05.600 --> 19:08.512
Because it's the nicest thing
that anyone ever did for me.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.591
Are you kidding me?

19:10.760 --> 19:13.433
I mean, not only did I not make
the bet, I lied about it.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.955
Woody, you should be going crazy.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.552
It was for my own good, Sam.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.310
Come on, man, don't do this to me.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.872
You're out $10,000 because of me.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.271
You couldn't have known
how it was gonna turn out.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.158
You thought I was gonna lose.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.595
No, wait a second.
What difference does that make?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.036
Come on! Man, I cheated you
out of $10,000.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.794
I mean, who do I think I am?
You should wanna kill me, Woody.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.235
It happened. I really don't see
the point in getting angry.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.789
Now, you're not being honest.
Now, down deep, you're mad.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.155
- You know you are.
- Maybe I am, just a little.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.550
No, you mean, "Hell, yes, I am, Sam!"

19:52.720 --> 19:54.039
Come on.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.670
It was still the nicest thing
that anyone ever did for me.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.990
You're a great man, Sam.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.516
Oh, man, you're hopeless.

20:03.680 --> 20:08.310
Go on, get out of here. At least
let me feel like a jerk in private.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.997
Sure, Sam.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.360
- Sorry.
- No, don't say--

20:19.760 --> 20:21.512
- Sam?
- What?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.192
I can't stand to see you like this.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.352
Would it make you feel better
if I took the dollar a week?

20:34.480 --> 20:37.392
Come on, man. A dollar a week
is meaningless.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.114
How about a dollar a week
and a raise?

20:40.680 --> 20:42.557
Nice gesture. Not good enough.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.597
Okay.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.911
How about a dollar a week, a raise...

20:48.360 --> 20:50.191
...and your Corvette?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.431
My car?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.231
Not a chance.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.554
- Why not?
- Don't be ridiculous. It's my car.

21:05.200 --> 21:10.991
- But you owe me $10,000.
- I don't care. I mean, it's my car.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.912
But you said you wanted
to make it up to me.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.799
We're talking about my car, Woody.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.030
I see.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.792
You say you're sorry,

21:19.960 --> 21:22.190
you say you care,
but when it comes down to it,

21:22.360 --> 21:24.032
- it's just a lot of lip motion.
- No--

21:24.200 --> 21:26.714
Well, I think that stinks!

21:26.880 --> 21:28.632
- That's good.
- You're nothing but a selfish,

21:28.800 --> 21:30.552
- lying creep!
- That's good. That's good.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.233
- You're angry now.
- Oh, you bet I am!

21:32.400 --> 21:35.039
- Now I'm gonna go pack my bags.
- Oh, no. Wait a second.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.679
What are you doing?
What do you mean?

21:36.840 --> 21:40.992
Oh, you're my boss and I yelled
at you, I can't stick around.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.913
Woody, Woody, Woody.
That was just a little yelling.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.878
- Now, that doesn't mean anything.
- Well, no, but I've never yelled

21:48.040 --> 21:49.871
at anybody like that before in my life.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.871
- We can't be friends anymore.
- Woody, come on.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.191
Woody, friends yell
at each other. It's okay.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.557
Coach and I used to fight all the time,
but we were good friends.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.756
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.036
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
it made us closer sometimes.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.509
- Oh, sure.
- No, I'm serious.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.716
Come here. Come here. Listen.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.235
Coach was a great peacemaker.
He had this little trick.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.597
He'd... You know, after a big fight,
he'd make us

22:14.760 --> 22:18.878
put our arms around each other
and sing "Home, Home on the Range."

22:19.560 --> 22:23.189
- I know. It sounds pretty silly, huh?
- Yeah.

22:23.720 --> 22:27.838
Well, do it for me anyway.
Come on, Woody.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.118
Come on. Yeah, there you go.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.556
Coach used to start me out
on the first few notes.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.478
Oh, give me a home

22:40.640 --> 22:43.552
Where the buffalo roam

22:43.880 --> 22:48.032
And the deer and the antelope play

22:48.200 --> 22:50.191
- How long we gotta sing this?
- Half an hour.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.476
Coach said that if you could sing
"Home on the Range"

22:52.640 --> 22:55.950
with a man for half an hour,
you couldn't possibly hold a grudge.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.157
Where seldom is heard

22:59.320 --> 23:02.278
A discouraging word

23:02.440 --> 23:07.309
And the skies are not cloudy all day

23:07.480 --> 23:09.789
- You feeling better?
- I still want your car.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.589
Home, home on the range

23:13.760 --> 23:17.469
Where the deer
and the antelope play

23:17.640 --> 23:21.349
- Coach's old trick.
- Oh, good. Everything's okay.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.511
A discouraging word

23:23.680 --> 23:27.798
And the skies are not cloudy all day

23:27.960 --> 23:31.919
Home, home on the range
